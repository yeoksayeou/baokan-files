    The Increasingly Consolidated and Developing Cooperative of Chongli County
    Wang Yuting, Zhang Runsheng
    Chongli County, in Chahar Province, is a remote area with many mountains and little land, few agricultural products, inconvenient transportation, and undeveloped trade.

    In April 1949, Chongli County established a county cooperative, but at that time it was merely setting up stalls and shops, emphasizing supply and neglecting sales, and simply pursuing profits. Therefore, the masses did not support it. From April 1949 to April 1951, only 3,161 members were developed in two years. In the first quarter of last year, the average monthly turnover was only 30 million yuan.

    After the provincial cooperative conference in April last year, the cooperative clarified its management policy and overcame the purely profit-seeking viewpoint. As a result, it has made great progress in organization and business. By the end of April this year, there were 12 grassroots cooperatives and 18 distribution outlets in the county, with more than 17,000 members. The average monthly turnover reached more than 470 million yuan; the turnover in the first quarter of this year reached 2.6 billion yuan, exceeding the plan and increasing by more than 29 times compared with the first quarter of last year.

    The main key to the development of Chongli County Cooperative is to seize the link of vigorously promoting local products and supplying means of production.

    Last year, Chahar Province suffered from famine. In order to help cooperative members with production and disaster relief, the cooperative promoted and sold over 2.7 million catties of medicinal materials, tree seeds, oat stalks, sesame, rapeseed, and white hemp to cooperative members in eight months, as well as 470 fat pigs and 1,000 chickens; at the same time, it transported grain seeds to meet the needs of the masses. On the one hand, it increased the income of the masses by more than 2.116 billion yuan and increased the purchasing power of cooperative members, and on the other hand, it solved the difficulties of spring plowing for the masses.

    Last winter, people with vehicles and livestock could not find work. The cooperative organized transportation teams with grassroots cooperatives as units. A total of 1,390 carts were organized, which increased the income of the masses by more than 39.6 million yuan. At the same time, in the past winter and this spring, the cooperative, according to the needs of the masses, used livestock loans issued by the National Bank to buy back more than 680 horses, 668 cattle, and 9,645 sheep for the masses. In January this year, the county was carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement, but in order not to delay farmers' production, the cooperative still assigned cadres to prepare farm tools for farmers and organized 40 carpenters to manufacture 300 carts and 1,076 harrows, rakes, and other farm tools for cooperative members. It also purchased a large number of carts, farm tools, pesticides, sprayers, and 120,000 catties of various seeds from other places, and delivered them to the masses in a timely manner. During spring plowing, the masses harnessed the cattle and horses bought by the cooperative to plow and sow in the fields. They happily said, "The cooperative has really done a lot for us this year!"

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the work efficiency of cooperative cadres has improved due to increased awareness. In the month after the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, the cooperative's turnover reached 2.4 billion yuan. In April, it signed many sales contracts and agreements with higher-level cooperatives, fraternal cooperatives, and state-owned companies, with a total value of more than 1.9 billion yuan; and signed long-term consignment contracts and agreements with state-owned enterprises such as Zhangyuan Cigarette Factory and Grain Company for flour, cigarettes, and matches. The eight contracts that have expired (with a total value of more than 600 million yuan) have been completed as required.

    Because the cooperative vigorously promotes local products and supplies cooperative members with means of production and means of livelihood, it has powerfully promoted the agricultural production increase movement and sideline production. The masses generally reflect: "The mountains are poor, but the people are not poor. As long as there is a cooperative, we can work hard."

    In order to adapt to the large-scale agricultural production increase movement, Chongli County Cooperative plans to develop 40,000 members by the end of this year.

    日渐巩固发展的崇礼县合作社
    王玉廷  张润生
    察哈尔省崇礼县是个山多地少，农产品不多，交通不便，贸易不发达的偏僻地区。
    一九四九年四月，崇礼县建立了县合作社，但当时只是摆摊坐铺、重供轻销、单纯追求利润，因此群众都不拥护。从一九四九年四月到一九五一年四月，两年内才发展了三千一百六十一名社员。去年第一季里，平均每月经营额只三千万元。
    去年四月省合作会议后，该社明确了经营方针，克服了单纯营利观点，因此在组织上、业务上都有很大发展。到今年四月底全县已有十二个基层合作社、十八个分销处，社员发展到一万七千多人。平均每月经营额达四亿七千多万元；今年第一季经营额达二十六亿元，超额完成了计划，与去年第一季比，增大了二十九倍多。
    崇礼县合作社获得发展的主要关键，就是抓住了大力推销土产和供应生产资料的环节。
    去年察哈尔省闹灾荒，为了帮助社员群众生产救灾，合作社八个月内，给社员群众推销了药材、树籽、莜麦秸、胡麻、菜籽、白麻二百七十多万斤，肥猪四百七十口，鸡一千只；同时，运来粮食籽种，供应群众需要。一方面使群众增加了二十一亿一千六百多万元的收入，提高了社员群众购买力，另一方面也解决了群众春耕困难。
    去年冬天，有车、有牲口的人找不到活，该社便以基层社为单位组织运输队，一共组织了一千三百九十辆大车，使群众增加三千九百六十多万元的收入。同时在去冬和今春，合作社根据群众要求，以国家银行发放的牲畜贷款，给群众买回六百八十多匹马、六百六十八头牛、九千六百四十五只羊。今年一月，县里正搞“三反”运动，但为了不误农民生产，合作社仍抽出干部给农民准备农具，组织四十个木匠给社员群众制造三百辆大车，一千零七十六件耙、耧等农具。并从外地买回大批大车、农具、农药、喷雾器和各种籽种十二万斤，适时地送到群众手里。春耕时，群众套上合作社给买回来的牛和马在地里耕地播种，他们高兴地说：“这一年来合作社真给咱们办了不少事！”
    “三反”运动以后，由于合作社干部觉悟提高，工作效率更提高了。“三反”结束后的一个月里，合作社营业额即达二十四亿元。四月里和上级社、兄弟社、国营公司等又订了很多推销合同和协议，总值十九亿多；并和张垣纸烟厂、粮食公司等国营企业订立了长期代销面粉、纸烟、火柴等合同和协议。这些合同到期的八件（总值六亿多）都已按规定完成。
    由于该社大力推销土产，供应社员生产资料和生活资料，有力地推动农业增产运动和副业生产，群众普遍反映：“山穷人不穷，只要有合作社，咱们好好劳动就行。”
    为了适应大规模的农业增产运动，崇礼县合作社计划今年年底发展到四万社员。
