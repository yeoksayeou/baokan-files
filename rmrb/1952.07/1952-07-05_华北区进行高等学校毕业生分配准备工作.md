Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—In accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on reforming the education system, the work of college graduates will be统筹 allocated by the government. The North China Region has begun preparations for the allocation of graduates this summer.

    The guiding principle for the allocation of college graduates this year is集中 使用、重点 配备 (concentrated use and prioritized allocation), first to meet the needs of national basic construction, and secondly to strengthen the staffing of secondary school teachers and college teaching assistants and graduate students. According to the general guideline, the allocation work will pay attention to grasping the spirit of the People's Daily editorial on June 14th, "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Positions Most Needed for Economic Construction," and the "Instructions on Several Issues in Adjusting the Work of College Graduates" issued by the Government Administration Council on June 27th, so that students' learning can further implement the principle of integrating theory with practice on the basis of adapting to the needs of national construction.

    In order to do a good job in the allocation of college graduates this year, the North China Region is preparing to establish a College Graduate Allocation Committee. The allocation committee will be composed of the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Education, the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, the North China Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Students' Federation, the Tianjin Students' Federation, and other units, as well as the chairmen of the graduate allocation committees of various colleges. An office will be set up under the allocation committee to absorb representatives from relevant departments and graduates of various colleges to participate in the specific allocation work of graduates. This will more closely integrate the allocation work with the actual situation of the graduates of each school. Each college will also establish an assistance graduate allocation committee to be responsible for ideological education for graduates and assist in the allocation work.

    This year's ideological education work for college graduates will not take the form of centralized study, organizing reports in one city or region, but rather decentralized study. The North China Region plans to make the following reports in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baoding, and other places respectively: a report on the revolutionary outlook on life of youth, a report on the development of national economic construction, a report on the development of people's education, and a report on the principles and policies of graduates obeying the unified allocation of the state and the allocation work. On July 2nd, Beijing schools invited Jiang Nanxiang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, to give a report to graduates on establishing a revolutionary outlook on life for young people. In addition to organizing graduates to listen to general reports and study, various schools also organize typical reports, special reports, symposiums, learning summaries, and other methods for learning, inspiring graduates' enthusiasm for loving the motherland and dedicating themselves to the construction of the motherland, improving their understanding of the unified allocation work, achieving the goal of consciously and voluntarily obeying the government's allocation, and taking up work actively and happily.

    华北区进行高等学校毕业生分配准备工作
    【新华社四日讯】根据中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定，高等学校毕业生的工作由政府统筹分配，华北区已开始进行今年暑假毕业生分配的准备工作。
    今年高等学校毕业生分配的方针是集中使用、重点配备，首先满足国家基本建设的需要，其次是加强中等学校师资和高等学校助教、研究生的配备。根据总的方针，在分配工作中将注意掌握人民日报六月十四日“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论和政务院六月二十七日所发“关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”的精神，使学生所学在适应国家建设需要的基础上更进一步的贯彻学用一致的原则。
    为了作好今年高等学校毕业生分配工作，华北区正准备成立高等学校毕业生分配委员会。分配委员会将由中央人民政府人事部、教育部、政务院华北行政委员会、中国新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会、中共北京市委员会、中共天津市委员会、北京市学生联合会、天津市学生联合会等单位及各高等学校协助毕业生分配委员会主任委员组成。分配委员会下设办公室，吸收各有关部门及各高等学校毕业生代表参加毕业生的具体分配工作。这样使分配工作与各校毕业生的实际情况更密切地结合。各高等学校并成立协助毕业生分配委员会，负责对毕业生进行思想教育，协助分配工作。
    今年高等学校毕业生的思想教育工作。不采取集中学习的形式，在一个城市或一个地区组织报告，分散学习。华北区准备在北京、天津、太原、保定等地分别作以下几个报告：青年革命人生观的报告，国家经济建设发展的报告，人民教育事业发展的报告和毕业生服从国家统一分配与分配工作的方针、原则的报告。北京各校已于七月二日请新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记蒋南翔对毕业生作了关于青年建立革命人生观的报告。各校除组织毕业生听大报告学习外，还组织典型报告、专题报告、座谈会、学习小结等方式进行学习，启发毕业学生热爱祖国和献身于祖国建设事业的热情，提高对统一分配工作的认识，达到自觉自愿服从政府分配的目的，积极愉快地走上工作岗位。
