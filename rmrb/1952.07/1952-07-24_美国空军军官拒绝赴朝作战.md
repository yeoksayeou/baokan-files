Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 23rd: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" reported on the 16th: An American Air Force spokesperson recently announced that in the past three weeks, 86 officers at the "Flight Training Center" have left their posts one after another, citing "fear of flying" as the reason. In addition, 73 air force officers and soldiers are also about to leave for the same reason.

In its report on this news, "l'Humanité" commented: This news seems very strange at first glance. How can one imagine a pilot being afraid of flying? But as long as you remember that the "Flight Training Center" is a place for producing pilots for the Korean War, it is not surprising. Therefore, it is not that 86 officers are "afraid," but that they refuse to go to Korea.

    美国空军军官拒绝赴朝作战
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】法国“人道报”十六日报道：美国空军一发言人最近宣布，在过去三个星期当中，“飞行训练中心”有八十六名军官以“害怕飞行”为理由，先后离职。另外有七十三名空军军官和士兵也为了同样的原因而快要离职。
    “人道报”在报道这消息时评论说：这个消息乍看之下实在很令人奇怪，飞行员害怕飞行，怎能想像呢？可是只要记得“飞行训练中心”是为朝鲜战争制造飞行员的地方，那就不足为怪了。所以，这并不是八十六名军官“害怕”，而是他们拒绝到朝鲜去。
