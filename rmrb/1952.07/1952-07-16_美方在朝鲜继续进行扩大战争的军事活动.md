Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 15th: Many signs indicate that the US side is implementing the adventurous policy of using so-called "military pressure" to influence the armistice negotiations, a policy that has already proven bankrupt. While administrative meetings are seeking ways to break the dangerous deadlock in the negotiations, the US military activities to continue and expand the war have intensified instead.

Gilbert R. Gilpatrick, the US Undersecretary of the Air Force, who secretly visited Korea earlier this month, announced on the 9th that he would send "hundreds" of jet planes to the Far East to strengthen the US Air Force. According to this plan, the first batch of US jet fighters has already flown from the United States to Japan.

To enable Van Fleet to use "military power" "more effectively" in launching adventurous offensives on the front lines, Clark announced on the 10th the relief of Van Fleet from all responsibility for the rear areas of the Eighth Army, establishing a new command to handle rear supply and administrative work.

Currently, US Army Chief of Staff Collins is "inspecting" the Korean front lines with Clark and Van Fleet. There are also reports that US Chief of Naval Operations Fechteler will also be coming to the Far East soon. Regarding these frequent activities of senior US generals, the US International News Service said: "This all makes people feel that large-scale military operations are forming in Korea."

These military activities of the US aggressors, as well as the barbarous bombing of peaceful cities in the rear of Korea by US military aircraft, and the fact of invading the airspace of Antung City in Northeast China and indiscriminately strafing, make people unable to avoid noticing that, although it is not yet known what the US side's attitude is in the administrative meetings, based on all these facts, it is already clear that the US aggressors are still playing the adventurous gamble of "military pressure."

Observers here point out that the US aggressors have already lost a large number of troops and equipment in two years of the war of aggression, and its temporary "advantage" in technical equipment is gradually weakening. In the past year alone, the increasingly strong Korean and Chinese People's Armies annihilated more than 325,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged more than 5,900 enemy aircraft. Two years of war and one year of negotiations have already proven that the US aggressors' so-called "military pressure" cannot help it achieve any purpose.

### 美方在朝鲜继续进行扩大战争的军事活动

    美方在朝鲜继续进行扩大战争的军事活动
    【新华社开城十五日电】许多迹象显示：美方正实行已经证明破产了的所谓以“军事压力”来影响停战谈判的冒险政策。当行政性会议正在谋求打开谈判的危险僵局的办法的时候，美方为继续和扩大战争而进行的军事活动却反而加紧了。
    曾经在本月初到朝鲜进行秘密活动的美国空军部副部长吉尔巴特里克，在九日宣布要派遣“几百架”喷气式飞机到远东去增强美国空军力量。按照这个计划，第一批美国喷气式战斗机已由美国飞往日本。
    为了使范佛里特可以“更有效地”使用“军事力量”在前线发动冒险进攻，克拉克在十日宣布解除范佛里特担负的第八军后方地区的全部责任，设立了一个新的司令部担任后方的供应与行政工作。
    现在，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯正和克拉克及范佛里特在朝鲜前线进行“视察”。还有消息说：美国的海军作战部长费泰勒不久也要到远东来。对于美国高级将领这种频繁的活动，美国的国际新闻社说：“这都使人更感觉到，大规模的军事行动正在朝鲜形成中。”
    美国侵略者的这些军事活动，以及美军飞机野蛮地滥炸朝鲜后方和平城市，和侵入我国东北安东市领空，滥施扫射的事实，使人们不能不注意到，虽然美方在行政性会议中的态度如何还无从知道，但是根据所有这些事实，已经可以明显地看出：美国侵略者仍在玩弄“军事压力”的冒险赌博。
    此间观察家指出，美国侵略者在两年侵略战争中已经丧失了大量的兵员和装备，它的技术装备上的暂时“优势”正在逐渐削弱之中。仅仅在去年一年之中，愈战愈强的朝中人民军队就歼灭敌军三十二万五千多名，击落击伤敌机五千九百多架。两年的战争和一年的谈判都已经证明：美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”决不能帮助它达到任何目的。
