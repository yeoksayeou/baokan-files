Letter from the Workers of Chongqing 101 Steel Plant to Chairman Mao

On the eve of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, all the workers of the Chongqing State-owned 101 Steel Plant, who victoriously completed the task of rolling all the steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, wrote to Chairman Mao to report the tremendous changes in their production and life over the past two years and to thank Chairman Mao and the Party's leadership. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

Our factory is the only factory in the country that produces heavy steel rails. We have completed the rolling of all the steel rails and accessories for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule as a gift to the Party's birthday. How happy we are in our hearts! Each of us wants to write a long letter to you to tell you what is in our hearts.

Chairman Mao: We Sichuan people have been looking forward to building a railway for more than forty years, but it has never been built. Those "emperors" and "presidents" have cheated us of our money, saying that it is too difficult to build a railway and that we have to buy equipment from abroad. Our factory's rolling mill was bought from Britain sixty years ago and has never been significantly altered. Later, the Kuomintang government listened to its American master and said that this machine was useless and left it to rust in the field. We had nothing to do and were unemployed one by one, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway could not be built. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we repaired the broken rolling mill and put it into operation to produce steel rails for the motherland. Chairman Mao, every steel rail of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was rolled by our own hands, and there is not a single foreign word on it. With the correct leadership of the Party, we Chinese people can do everything and do it well. Chairman Mao, we are really excited to be able to make this contribution to China's steel industry. We are not proud of ourselves, but proud of the Party and the motherland.

Our factory has undergone fundamental changes in the past two years. The state of paralyzed production has long become a historical relic; not only are all the chimneys smoking, but new chimneys are also being erected continuously; all the machines are running; the number of workers has tripled compared to two years ago, countless young workers are pouring in, and many fathers, sons, brothers, and couples are working in the factory. Zhang Wenjin, a model steelmaking worker, and his five brothers are now all workers in the factory. In the past, they were forced to wander around by life. The output and quality of our products have increased by two to ten times. A new record can sometimes only be maintained for one day, and the next day it is broken by a newer record. In May of this year, the rail workers even set thirty new records. Our production is really like a race. The factory is a scene of prosperity.

Dear Chairman Mao, the political awareness of our factory workers has been further enhanced. More than 250 of us have honorably joined the Party; more than 800 have honorably joined the League; and even more people are striving to join the Party and the League. In this great "Three-Anti" movement, all the workers in our factory participated without exception. Through this movement, we have recognized the ugliness of bourgeois ideology, the shamefulness of corruption, and drawn a clear line between ourselves and the bourgeoisie. Nearly a hundred outstanding workers have been promoted to leadership positions at all levels. You can now see worker cadres in any office. They are working very well. Our working class is fully capable of managing the factory. The progress of the basic construction project in the past four months is equivalent to the progress of the past two years.

Our area has been transformed into a workers' city in the past two years. Hundreds of red-tiled, yellow-walled buildings have been built on the mountains around the factory, and banks and cooperatives have been opened here. Our wages have at least doubled. The days of having lice in the summer and eating kale all year round have long been abandoned by us. Our factory workers deposit about one billion yuan in the bank every month. Take Du Jicheng, our newly promoted deputy director of the steelmaking plant, for example. He earns more than 800,000 yuan a month, and his family of three spends at most 500,000 yuan a month. He deposits the rest of the money in the bank and also buys books such as "Open Hearth Steelmaking Method" to read. Almost all of our children can go to school. Our cultural life has also become richer. More than 3,600 people in the factory are studying in spare-time schools, at least 200 to 300 people go to the library every day, and many old workers also go to literacy classes with books.

Dear Chairman Mao, our factory is now holding a grand celebration meeting for labor models and advanced production teams, and is reviewing our achievements over the past two years in order to welcome the large-scale production increase and thrift campaign that will soon be launched in the factory. We assure you that we will thoroughly complete the production reform work this year and strive to complete the annual production increase and thrift target of 23 billion yuan! We will victoriously move towards the upcoming large-scale construction phase of the motherland!

Wishing you good health.

Respectfully submitted by all the workers of the Southwest Industrial Department 101 Steel Plant.

June 25th.

### 重庆一零一钢铁厂职工给毛主席的信

    重庆一零一钢铁厂职工给毛主席的信
    胜利完成成渝铁路全线钢轨轧制任务的重庆国营一零一钢铁厂全体职工在中国共产党三十一周年纪念日前夕，上书毛主席报告他们两年多来生产和生活上的巨大变化，感谢毛主席和党的领导。全信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们的工厂是全国唯一出产重钢轨的工厂。我们已提前轧完成渝铁路的全部钢轨和配件，作为对党的生日的献礼。我们每个人的心里多么高兴啊！我们每个人都想写一封长长的信给您，向您说说心底里的话。
    毛主席：我们四川人盼望修一条铁路，盼了四十多年，可是老修不成，那些“皇帝”和“总统”把我们的钱都骗了去，说是修铁路如何如何困难，非要到外国去买器材不可。我们厂里的轧钢机，从英国买回来六十几年，从没有大动过。后来，国民党政府又听他那美国主子的话，说这部机器是废物，丢在野外生锈。我们闲着没事做，一个个都失业了，成渝铁路也修不起来。解放后，我们在党和人民政府领导下把过去坏了的轧钢机修复起来，开动起来，为祖国生产钢轨。毛主席，成渝铁路的钢轨每一根都是我们亲手轧成的，那上面没有一个外国字。有了党的正确领导，我们中国人民什么都做得到，做得好。毛主席，我们能在中国的钢铁事业中有这一点贡献，我们真是兴奋，我们不为个人骄傲，而为党、为祖国骄傲。
    我们的工厂两年多来已发生根本变化。生产瘫痪状态早已成为历史陈迹；烟囱不但全部冒烟，新的烟囱也不断竖立起来了；机器全部开动了；工人比两年多前添了三倍，无数的青年工人涌进来，许多父子、兄弟、夫妻都在工厂里做工。模范炼钢工人张文金五弟兄现在都是厂里的工人，过去他们是被生活逼得到处流落的。我们的产品的产量和质量都提高了二倍到十倍，一个新纪录有时只能保持一天，第二天它就被更新的纪录突破了。钢轨工人在今年五月份竟出现了三十个新纪录。我们的生产真像是在赛跑一样地进行着。厂里是一片欣欣向荣的气象。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们全厂职工的政治觉悟更加提高了。我们已经有二百五十多人光荣地参加了党；有八百多人光荣地加入了团；还有更多的人正在争取入党、入团。这次伟大的“三反”运动，我们全厂职工毫无例外地都参加了。经过这次运动，我们认识了资产阶级思想的丑恶，认识了贪污的可耻，划清了和资产阶级的界限。我们有近百名的优秀工人已被提升到各级领导岗位上来，无论在哪一个办公室，现在都可以看到工人干部了。他们工作得很好，我们工人阶级是完全有能力管好工厂的。基本建设工程四个月来的进展已相当于过去两年的进展。
    我们这里两年来已经要变成工人城了，数百幢红瓦黄墙的楼房在工厂四周的山上修建起来了，银行、合作社都在这里开设了。我们的工资至少都已提高一倍以上。夏天生虱子，终年吃牛皮菜的日子早已被我们抛弃了。我们全厂工人每月要在银行存款十亿元左右。拿新从工人提升的我们炼钢场副场长杜集成来说，他一月收入八十多万元，一家三口人每月最多化五十万元，剩下的钱他就存入银行，还买了些“平炉冶炼法”一类的书籍来看。我们的小孩差不多都能上学了。我们的文化生活也丰富起来，全厂有三千六百多人在业余学校读书，每天至少有二、三百人进图书馆，许多老工人也夹着书本进速成识字班了。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们全厂现在正在热烈召开劳动模范和先进生产小组庆祝大会，正在检阅我们两年来的成绩，以便迎接即将在厂内开展的大规模增产节约竞赛运动。我们向您保证：我们要彻底在今年做好生产改革工作，为完成全年增产节约二百三十亿元的目标而奋斗！我们要胜利地走向祖国即将到来的大规模建设阶段！
    祝您健康
      西南工业部一零一钢铁厂全体职工敬上
                              六月二十五日
