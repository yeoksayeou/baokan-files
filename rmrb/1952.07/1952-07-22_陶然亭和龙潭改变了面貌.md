Taoranting and Longtan Change Their Appearance
Bai Sheng Ke Hui
In the past three years, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to improve the capital's sanitary environment, has vigorously carried out sanitary construction projects. Since 1950, it has successively completed the dredging projects of Longxugou, Beihai, Zhonghai, Nanhai, Shichahai, and many sewers. Recently, it has basically completed the dredging project of the Taoranting reed pond, and is preparing to complete the dredging project of eight "Longxugou" by the end of this year. The Longtan dredging project, which has already begun, is one of them.

Taoranting is located in the south of Beijing, not far from Xianongtan, Nanxiawazi, and Heiyaochang, and was once called a "scenic spot." In fact, there is no pavilion here, only a dilapidated ancient temple, surrounded by reed ponds, with many weed-covered, messy graves in the northeast. It is said that this pavilion was built by Jiang Zao, a vice minister of the Ministry of Works, in the thirty-fourth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, so it is also called "Jiang Pavilion." During the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, literati and scholars liked to come here every autumn in September to drink and write poetry. Later, this pavilion site became particularly desolate due to years of disrepair, coupled with the constant destruction during the rule of the past reactionary governments. The reed pond had long become a major base for flies and mosquitoes. Its stench and filth were comparable to the previous Longxugou. Sewage flowing from the Sipingyuan stinking ditch and the Zhenbei Tannery gathered here; a lot of garbage accumulated in the reed pond and on the surrounding banks. Therefore, in summer, the sewage and dead dogs and cats in the pond emitted an unpleasant odor; swarms of mosquitoes and flies bred here, spreading out and endangering the health of the people in the capital. This was the original face of this "scenic spot."

The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau started the dredging project of Taoranting reed pond in mid-April this year, turning it into a new lake. By the end of last month, after the strenuous labor of thousands of working people, the project has been basically completed. This is another new project for the construction of the people's capital following the dredging projects of Longxugou, Shichahai, etc. In this project, the newly excavated lake area is more than 170,000 square meters (approximately 280 acres), and the lake shore is more than seven li long, with a depth of more than nine chi from the lake shore to the bottom of the lake. The lake extends from a place called Yaotai in the north, southward in two directions, east and west, forming an irregular long bay shape. In the center of the lake is a gourd-shaped islet, and Taoranting is located at the southwest end of this islet. Around the lake, seven earthen hills were built with the soil dug from the lake. The highest earthen hill is nearly three zhang high. Standing on it, you can see the scenery of the inner city of Beijing.

Now, there are still thousands of workers working hard at the Taoranting construction site, doing the final finishing touches. More than three months ago, after accepting the task of dredging the Taoranting reed pond, they braved the scorching sun and the stench emanating from the stinking mud and sewage every day to improve the sanitary environment for the people of the capital. At the most intense stage of the work, more than 8,000 people were engaged in labor on this construction site, and more than 100 women also persistently participated in the lake excavation project.

The old people near Taoranting witnessed the transformation of the stinking reed pond with their own eyes and personally experienced the happiness brought to them by the Communist Party and the People's Government. Zhao Fuxiang, an old man who had been guarding Taoranting for more than 20 years, said: "For more than 20 years, since I lived in this place, who has ever thought of us? The Kuomintang reactionaries only knew to ask us for sanitation donations, cleaning fees, ditch repair money..., but we couldn't see the shadow of sanitation and cleaning...." He said that they didn't repair it, but instead piled sewage and garbage here year after year, making the place more and more smelly and dirty. In March, mosquitoes and flies began to appear, and later more and more. Every summer night, no one could sleep well, and mosquitoes stung you in groups; during the day, when eating, flies swarmed on bowls, chopsticks, corn cakes, and pancakes. He said that this year is really different. Not to mention that it is difficult to see mosquitoes and flies in the house and yard, it is also difficult to see those things in the latrine and dung pit. A resident named Sun Kechun also participated in this lake excavation project. He and his wife excitedly said: When we lived here last summer, although we made a mosquito net with flour bags, the mosquitoes still bit us all over with red bumps. In order to completely eliminate them, we are willing to participate in the lake excavation project! They have great hope for Taoranting, because they know that in the near future, the new lake will bring them health!

Longtan is located in the southeast corner of the outer city of Beijing. It is a narrow and long depression with an area of about 454,400 square meters. Before dredging, it was like Taoranting in the southwest corner of the outer city, an endless stretch of reed ponds, interspersed with some cemeteries and messy graves. During the rainy season, it not only had to receive the stinking water overflowing from Longxugou, but also the sewage and rainwater from all parts of the eastern half of the city and the southern moat also gathered here. Therefore, this depression became many large and small sewage pits. Some filth, such as dead cats and dead rats, washed in from the city with the sewage, gathered here, rotted and stank under the sunlight, and became a breeding ground for flies and black mosquitoes.

Residents living around this depression told us: This sewage pit has a history of more than 200 years. The reactionary rulers of the past dynasties have extorted countless "cleaning fees" and "sanitation donations" from nearby residents, saying that they wanted to improve the sanitary environment, but until liberation, it was still a large stinking water pit - a hotbed for mosquitoes and flies.

This spring, in order to thoroughly improve the sanitary environment of the southeastern city and eliminate the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and flies, the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau first drained the sewage around Longtan while dredging Taoranting. Now, a large number of workers have been transferred from the Taoranting construction site to participate in the Longtan dredging project. They live in tents, braving the invasion of mosquitoes and flies, working hard shovel by shovel to complete this project that concerns the health and lives of the people in the capital. From this, people can deeply realize that the "miracle" of the greatly reduced mosquitoes and flies in Beijing in summer did not fall from the sky, but is the result of the labor of the people in the capital. A comrade from the model team in the construction site said well:
"Our current work is not an ordinary work, but a great work that concerns the health and lives of the people in the capital; doing this work well is equivalent to contributing to the motherland."

The Longtan dredging project has started. The residents from Guangqumen to Nanquekou are very excited. Mr. Sui, who has lived here for four generations, told us: "Since the sewage in Longtan was drained this spring, there have been much fewer mosquitoes and flies in this area. In previous years, in summer, how could anyone stand here at this time? Sandflies would bite you so much that you would have to cover your face. At night, you couldn't think of sleeping without a mosquito net, and mosquitoes came out in groups to bite people. When eating, flies swarmed around corn cakes and rice bowls, and you couldn't drive them away. Especially when the sun was at its peak, the stinking water in the pond evaporated, and the stench drilled into people's nostrils. Ah, who can live with their noses pinched? You just had to accept getting sick. I heard that a park will be built here next year. In the future, there will be no more mosquitoes and flies here, and the illnesses of adults and children will be greatly reduced."

The future of Taoranting and Longtan is beautiful. Liang Sicheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Urban Planning Commission, pointed to the construction blueprint of the people's capital and told us: In the near future, the water of the Yongding River will be introduced into the new lake of Taoranting and Longtan Lake. Various flowers, trees, and new buildings will be planted on the four banks of the lake. They will be connected with Xianongtan and the Temple of Heaven to become a beautiful large park.

    陶然亭和龙潭改变了面貌
    柏生  克惠
    三年来，北京市人民政府为了改善首都的卫生环境，曾以大力进行了卫生建设工程，从一九五零年起先后完成了龙须沟、北海、中海、南海、什刹海及许多下水道的修浚工程，最近又基本完成了陶然亭苇塘的疏浚工程，并准备在今年年底完成八条“龙须沟”的修浚工程，已经开始的龙潭疏浚工程，就是其中的一部分。
    陶然亭在北京城南，跟先农坛、南下洼子、黑窑厂等地相距不远，曾被称为“风景区”。其实这里并没有什么亭子，只不过是一座破古庙罢了，四周围绕着苇塘，东北面有许多荒草萋萋的乱坟堆。据说这个亭子是清朝康熙三十四年一个名叫江藻的工部侍郎所建造的，所以又叫做“江亭”。在满清皇朝统治时代，文人雅士们在每年秋九月，都喜欢到这里来饮酒、赋诗。后来，这个亭址因年久失修，加上过去反动政府统治时代的不断破坏，格外显得冷落荒凉。那苇塘也早已成为苍蝇、蚊子的大本营了。它的臭和脏的程度，可以和先前的龙须沟相比。从附近四平园臭水沟和振北制革厂方面流来的污水，都汇集到这里；苇塘中和四周的岸上都堆积了不少的垃圾。因此，一到夏天，塘里的污水和死狗死猫，都发散着难闻的臭味；成群的蚊虫、苍蝇，从这里孳生出来，飞散开去，危害着首都人民的健康。这就是这个“风景区”原来的面目。
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局从今年四月中旬开始了陶然亭苇塘的疏浚工程，把它开辟成一个新湖。到上月底为止，经过几千劳动人民的紧张劳动，工程已经基本完竣了。这是继龙须沟、什刹海等修浚工程之后，又一次建设人民首都的新工程。在这个工程中，计新挖的湖面有十七万多平方公尺（约二百八十多亩），湖岸周围有七里多长，从湖岸到湖底深九尺多。湖从北面一个叫做窑台的地方，向南分东西两面伸展开去，构成不规则的长湾形，湖中心是一个葫芦形的小岛，陶然亭便在这小岛的西南首。在湖的周围，用从湖中挖出来的土堆建起了七座土山，其中最高的土山近三丈多高，站在上面远眺，可以望见北京内城的景物。
    现在还有上千工人正在陶然亭工地紧张地劳动着，做着最后的修缮工程。三个多月来他们接受了修浚陶然亭苇塘的任务后，便天天冒着烈日和从臭泥污水中发散出来的恶臭，为首都人民改善着环境卫生。工作最紧张时，在这工地上曾有过八千多人从事劳动，一百多个妇女也始终不懈地参加了挖湖工程。
    陶然亭附近的老百姓，亲眼看到臭水苇塘变了样，亲身体会到共产党和人民政府带给他们的幸福。在陶然亭里看守了二十多年的赵福祥老汉说：“二十多年了，从我住在这块地方起，有谁曾经为我们想一想？国民党反动派只知道向我们要什么卫生捐、清洁费、修沟钱……，却见不到卫生清洁的影儿……。”他说他们不修倒也罢了，反而一年一年地把污水垃圾都堆到这儿来，弄得这地方越来越臭，越来越脏。一到三月天，蚊虫、蝇子开始出现，往后越来越多，每年夏天晚上谁也不能好好地睡觉，蚊子成群地叮你；白天吃饭，苍蝇成堆地爬在碗上、筷子上、窝窝头上、饼上。他说今年可真不同了，别说屋里院里蚊蝇都很难看到，就是茅房粪坑里也都难看到那些东西了。一个叫孙克纯的居民，也参加了这次的挖湖工程。他和他的老婆都兴奋地说：我们去年夏天住在这里时，虽然用面口袋布做了个蚊帐，可是蚊子还是把我们咬得满身是红疙瘩。为了彻底扑灭它们，我们都愿参加挖湖工程！他们对陶然亭都怀着很大的希望，因为他们知道，在不久的将来，新湖将带给他们以健康！

    龙潭在北京外城的东南角，是一条面积约四十五万四千平方公尺的狭长洼地。在未疏浚以前，它和外城西南角的陶然亭一样，是一片一眼望不尽的苇塘，中间还夹杂着一些义地和乱坟堆。一到雨季，它不仅要受纳从龙须沟溢漫出来的臭水，同时从东半城各处以及南护城河流来的污水和雨水也汇集到这里，因此这片洼地变成了许多大大小小的污水坑。从城里随着污水冲来的一些秽物，如死猫、死鼠等都聚集在这里，在太阳光底下腐烂、发臭，成为苍蝇、黑蚊的孳生场所。
    居住在这洼地周围的居民告诉我们：这个污水坑已经有了二百多年的历史了。历代的反动统治者曾经向附近居民勒索无数的“清洁费”和“卫生捐”说是要改善卫生环境，可是直到解放，这里依然是
    一个大臭水坑，——蚊蝇的大温床。
    今年春季，北京市卫生工程局为了彻底改善东南城的环境卫生，消灭蚊蝇的孳生地，在疏浚陶然亭的同时，首先抽干了龙潭四围的污水。现在，又从陶然亭工地抽调大批工人参加龙潭的疏浚工程。他们住在帐篷里，冒着蚊蝇的侵袭，一镢一铲地为完成这个攸关首都人民健康和生命的工程而斗争。从这里人们可以深深体会到，北京夏天蚊蝇大大减少的
    “奇迹”并不是从天上掉下来的，它是首都人民的劳动成果。工地里模范小队的一个同志说得好：
    “我们现在的工作，不是一件普通的工作，而是一件关系首都人民健康和生命的伟大工作；搞好这件工作，就等于为祖国出了一分力量。”
    龙潭的疏浚工程开工了，从广渠门到南缺口一带的居民都非常兴奋，在这里居住了四代的隋老先生告诉我们说：“自从今年春季，龙潭里的污水被抽干以后，这一带的蚊蝇便少得多了。往年，一到夏天，这会儿那能在这里站人，白蛉子准把你咬得非把脸蒙起来不可。夜晚，没有蚊帐就不用想睡觉，蚊子成群地出来叮人。吃饭的时候，苍蝇黑压压的围着窝窝头、饭碗打转转，赶也赶不走。尤其是太阳当顶的时候，塘里的臭水蒸发了，那臭气也就一股劲地往人们的鼻孔里钻。啊，谁能捏着鼻子过日子，生病也只有认了。听说明年这里要修公园，往后咱们这里不会再有蚊蝇了，大人小孩的病痛也会大大减少。”
             ×    ×    ×
    陶然亭和龙潭的远景是美丽的。北京都市计划委员会梁思成副主任指着人民首都的建设蓝图告诉我们：在不久的将来，永定河的水将引入陶然亭新湖和龙潭湖，湖的四岸将种植各种花草树木，建立新的建筑物。它们将和先农坛、天坛，连成一片，成为一个美丽的大公园。
