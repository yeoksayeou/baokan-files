    Jingjiang Flood Diversion All Women Model Representatives
    Ready to Respond to Chairman Mao's New Call at Any Time
    Respected Chairman Mao: Under your great call, we participated in the unprecedented great construction in the history of our motherland - the "Jingjiang Flood Diversion" project. When this great project was successfully completed, we were selected as models and went to Shashi to attend the grand and grand Hero Model Representative Conference, and received a warm welcome from people from all walks of life and the cordial care and condolences from the leaders. We have received unprecedented glory in our lives, and we are unspeakably moved and excited. We are able to become models and attend this conference as a result of the party's education and cultivation and the help of the masses. Therefore, our glory is your glory, the glory of the Communist Party, and the glory of the broad masses of the people!
    Thinking back to the old society, women were subjected to heavy oppression and humiliation, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. Today, we are deeply proud of being able to participate in the construction of our motherland! Proud of having the wise leader Chairman Mao! Although we are now models, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements. We make the following guarantee to you: We will definitely not be arrogant or complacent, and we will continue to work hard, strengthen political study, strive to improve ourselves, maintain glory, carry forward glory, and be ready to respond to your call at any time, and devote ourselves to the great construction of the motherland with infinite loyalty!

    随时准备响应毛主席新的号召
    敬爱的毛主席：在你的伟大号召之下，我们参加了祖国历史上空前的伟大建设——“荆江分洪”工程。当这个伟大工程胜利完成的时候，我们被选为模范，到沙市出席隆重盛大的英雄模范代表大会，受到了各界人民的热烈欢迎和首长们亲切的关怀与慰问。我们得到了有生以来从未有过的光荣，我们心里有说不出来的感动与兴奋。我们能够当上模范，能够出席这次大会，这是党的教育培养和群众帮助的结果。因此，我们的光荣是您的光荣，共产党的光荣，广大人民的光荣！
    回想在旧社会里，妇女受着重重的压迫和侮辱，过着牛马不如的生活。如今，我们深深为自己能参加祖国建设而自豪！为我们有英明领袖毛主席的领导而骄傲！我们今天虽然当了模范，但是我们决不满足于现有的这些成绩。我们向你提出保证：一定不骄不傲，再接再厉，加强政治学习，努力提高自己，保持光荣，发扬光荣，随时准备响应您的号召，以无限忠诚献身于祖国的伟大建设事业！
