    Volunteer Army Air Force Hero Liu Yuti
    Xu Shulun
    An aerial battle was fiercely underway over a certain area of Korea. Around the command vehicle at our airfield, ground crew, staff officers, political officers, and logistics personnel, all working diligently for the victory of the air battle, were intently listening to the commander's resolute orders and the air warriors' reports and requests for attack transmitted over the radio.
    A few minutes later, the radio broadcast the commander's order for the units to return. The air battle was over. The political commissar took me to the parking line to wait for the return of the aircraft. The ground crew had already arranged everything to welcome their comrades and prepare for the next battle.
    Jet fighters, gleaming with silver light, landed in groups. One of the planes was taxiing towards where we were standing. The pilot shut off the engine and stepped out of the cockpit. The political commissar introduced me: "This is Comrade Liu Yuti, the Air Force hero who shot down five enemy planes and damaged two in three air battles." By the time I caught up, the ground crew of this plane had already surrounded him, warmly congratulating him on his new achievement of shooting down an enemy plane today.
    The political commissar congratulated Comrade Liu Yuti, encouraging him to fight more bravely and skillfully for the motherland, the Korean people, and world peace. Then, the political commissar handed him a letter from a superior commander congratulating him on his previous two victories. The letter said: "Congratulations on your victory of shooting down five enemy planes and damaging two. We hope you will carefully study your experiences, improve your skills and tactics, train to become an Air Force commander with both wisdom and courage, continue to carry forward the spirit of heroic combat, and strive for greater victories..."
    Liu Yuti finished reading the letter, deeply moved by this noble honor, and his spirit seemed particularly invigorated. He said: "I know that this is not only the encouragement and expectation of the superior commanders, but also of the people of the motherland and the Korean people for the Volunteer Army Air Force. We deeply feel this encouragement and expectation every time we step into the planes donated by the people of the motherland."

    Along with the young Volunteer Army Air Force warriors, Liu Yuti is advancing with firm steps in the storm of war. He has experienced countless battles. He told me a lot about his own and other comrades' combat experiences. Here, I will introduce how he shot down three enemy planes in one air battle.
    One day, after they discovered four enemy planes over a certain area, they received permission from the leading commander and bravely pursued them. However, in the blink of an eye, the enemy planes suddenly disappeared again. They searched meticulously outward and saw our anti-aircraft artillery units firing puffs of white smoke in their lower left – which conveniently indicated the direction of the enemy planes to them. Liu Yuti led four planes towards this direction. In the sky several thousand meters high, he could see that not far below was a peaceful and beautiful Korean village, with a few sparse white houses surrounded by lush green trees. Suddenly, thick smoke and fire rose above this village. He knew that the enemy was bombing the village. This new situation further increased his hatred for the American aerial bandits. "Forward, take down these murdering and arsonist bandits!" They bravely swooped down. Finally, the four enemy planes appeared one by one from the smoke and fire before his eyes. He thought, "A good village is about to be destroyed by you. Don't even think about escaping! Today, we must let the suffering Korean people see you go down in flames with their own eyes!" He issued an attack order to his comrades. He himself, with Comrade Wang Zhaoming piloting the wingman, closely pursued them. The murdering bandits can only be ferocious in front of kind and peaceful people. Once they encounter our aerial warriors, they accelerate and flee towards the sea. Liu Yuti, determined to avenge the Korean people, fired a volley of shells fiercely as he approached the enemy planes. However, the cunning enemy evaded Liu Yuti's attack and desperately fled. Liu Yuti and his wingman, like two brave eagles, chased after these thieves who were fleeing for their lives. Our jet fighters flew forward like divine winds, and the distance to the enemy planes became closer and closer. When they were only two hundred meters away, Liu Yuti suddenly opened fire on the fleeing enemy. An enemy plane immediately trailed thick black smoke and ended its ugly life in the place it had wreaked havoc.
    The enemy plane was shot down. Filled with the joy of victory, Liu Yuti ascended to a higher altitude to seek new combat opportunities. At this moment, the three enemy planes that had fled to the sea earlier cunningly followed from behind, attempting to retaliate. Seeing that the bandits were about to open fire on Liu Yuti, wingman Wang Zhaoming fulfilled his glorious duty at this extremely critical moment, launching a fierce attack on the three attacking enemy planes and shattering the enemy's conspiracy to launch a sneak attack. The enemy planes fled in panic again.
    After Liu Yuti turned his plane around, he saw thick smoke and fire rising from the ground ahead again. Upon closer inspection, it was eight enemy planes dropping bombs on the railway. He was determined not to let the enemy go and quickly circled behind this group of bandits, latching onto an enemy plane. When the enemy realized they had been attacked and wanted to escape, Liu Yuti had already fired his shells. The enemy plane fell with a trail of smoke.
    Liu Yuti flew forward for a while, and another group of enemy planes appeared below. "Another opportunity has come!" He was determined to punish this group of bandits. When the enemy planes were already within his range, he thought, "Still far away, wait until they are closer." But the enemy suddenly realized that they were being pursued and scattered in all directions, fleeing separately. Liu Yuti immediately chased after them, aiming at the enemy wingman. When he was only one hundred and eighty meters away, he began firing fiercely. Another enemy plane was buried in the land of Korea.

    In three battles, Liu Yuti shot down a total of five enemy planes and damaged two, making contributions to the motherland, the Korean people, and world peace. The Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army approved him for a Special Class Merit once. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also awarded him a Military Service Medal. When the anti-American and aid-Korea medal given by the people of the motherland and the military service medal sent by the people of Korea shone on his chest, he knew how he should respond to the noble honor and expectation given to him by the people of the motherland and the people of Korea. He vowed to fight more bravely for world peace. (Attached picture)

    志愿军空军英雄刘玉堤
    徐述纶
    一场空战正在朝鲜某地上空激烈地进行着。我方机场上的指挥车旁围满了为空战胜利而辛勤工作着的地勤、参谋、政治、后勤工作人员，他们聚精会神地倾听着无线电里传出的指挥员的坚决的命令和空战勇士们报告情况和请求攻击的声音。
    几分钟以后，无线电里传来了指挥员命令部队返航的声音。空战结束了。政治委员带我到停机线去等候机群的归来。地勤人员早已在那里把迎接战友和准备下次战斗的工作安排停当了。
    喷气式战斗机闪射着银光，一组组地降落了。其中一架飞机正向我们站立的地方滑来。飞行员关了车，从座舱里走下飞机。政治委员向我介绍：“这就是在三次空战中击落敌机五架、击伤敌机两架的空军英雄刘玉堤同志。”等我赶上去的时候，这架飞机的地勤人员已经抢先围住他，热烈地祝贺他今天击落一架敌机的新战绩。
    政治委员向刘玉堤同志道贺，勉励他为祖国、为朝鲜人民和世界和平更勇敢、更机智地战斗。接着，政治委员又递给他一封上级指挥员祝贺他前两次战绩的信。信上说：“庆祝你击落敌机五架、击伤敌机两架的胜利。希望你很好地研究经验，提高技术、战术，锻炼成为一个智勇兼备的空军指挥员，继续发扬英勇作战的精神，争取更大的胜利……”
    刘玉堤读完了这封信，为这种崇高的荣誉所激动，精神显得格外饱满，他说：“我知道这不仅是上级指挥员而且是祖国人民和朝鲜人民对志愿军空军的鼓舞和期望。这种鼓舞和期望是每当我们跨进祖国人民捐献的飞机的时候都深切地感觉到的。”

    和年轻的志愿军空军战士们一道，刘玉堤在战争的风暴里以坚定的步伐前进着。他经历过无数次的战斗。他和我谈了很多他自己的和别的同志的战斗经历。这里我来介绍一下他是怎样在一次空战中击落三架敌机的。
    一天，当他们在某地上空发现四架敌机以后，得到领队指挥员的允准就勇猛地追过去，但是只一转眼，敌机忽然又不见了。他们严密地往外搜索，看到在他们的左下方，我们的高射炮部队射起了朵朵白烟——这正好给他们指示了敌机的方向。刘玉堤就带领着四架飞机向着这个方向飞去。他在几千公尺高的天空，看出下面不远的地方是一个和平美丽的朝鲜村庄，稀疏的几间白房子，周围长着碧绿的树丛。突然，这个村庄上空升起了浓烈的烟火。他知道了：敌人正对着这个村庄进行轰炸。这个新的情况更增加了他对美国空中强盗的愤恨。“前进，打掉这伙杀人放火的强盗！”他们勇猛地俯冲下去。终于，四架敌机从烟火里一个个出现在他的眼前了。他想：“好好的一个村庄，眼看着就被你们毁灭了。你们别想逃！今天一定要让受难的朝鲜人民亲眼看着你冒烟掉下去！”他向他的战友们下了攻击的命令。他自己也带着由王昭铭同志驾驶的僚机紧紧地追过去。杀人的强盗只能在善良的和平人民面前逞凶，一遇到我们的空中勇士们，就加快速度，向海面逃去了。一心要为朝鲜人民复仇的刘玉堤，在逼近敌机的时候，狠狠地发射了一排炮弹。但是狡猾的敌人避开了刘玉堤的攻击，拚命逃跑。刘玉堤和他的僚机，像两只勇猛的鹰一样，向着这些没命逃跑的盗贼追赶过去。我们的喷气式战斗机神风般地向前飞驶，和敌机的距离也越来越近了，到了只距二百公尺的时候，刘玉堤猛然向着逃敌开了炮，一架敌机立刻冒着浓烈的黑烟，在它肆虐的地方结束了丑恶的生命。
    敌机被打落了。刘玉堤满怀着胜利的喜悦，升向高空去寻求新的作战机会。正在这时，原先向海上逃去的三架敌机，又狡猾地从后面偷偷跟来，企图报复。眼看强盗们就要向刘玉堤开火了，僚机驾驶员王昭铭在这万分紧急的时刻履行了他的光荣职责，对来袭的三架敌机进行了猛烈的攻击，粉碎了敌人偷袭的阴谋。敌机又慌慌张张地逃走了。
    刘玉堤扭转机头以后，又看见前边大地上升起了浓烈的烟火，凑近一看，又是八架敌机向铁道扔了炸弹。他决心不放过敌人，神速地绕到这批强盗的后边，咬住一架敌机。当敌人发觉想逃跑的时候，刘玉堤早已射出了炮弹，敌机长拖着一股烟掉下去了。
    刘玉堤往前飞了一程，一群敌机又出现在下边了。“机会又来了！”他决心惩罚这批强盗。当敌人双机已经入了他的射程时，他想：“还远着哩，近了再打。”可是敌人突然发觉自己已被追击，就各奔东西，分头逃开。刘玉堤立即追上去，瞄准了敌人的僚机，凑近到只有一百八十公尺时，他开始了猛烈的射击。又一架敌机被埋葬在朝鲜的土地上。

    先后三次的战斗，刘玉堤共击落敌机五架，击伤敌机两架，为祖国、为朝鲜人民与世界和平立下了功勋。中国人民志愿军司令部批准他立特等功一次。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府同时颁给他军功章。当他的胸前闪耀着祖国人民送给的抗美援朝纪念章和这枚军功章的光芒时，他知道他应该怎样来回答祖国人民、朝鲜人民所加给自己的崇高的荣誉和期望，他宣誓要为世界和平而更勇敢地战斗下去。（附图片）
