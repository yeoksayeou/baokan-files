Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 15th: The Second Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, which opened in Berlin on July 9th, closed on the 12th. The central slogan of the conference was: "Advance in the struggle for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism!"

    Socialist Unity Party General Secretary Ulbricht delivered a long report at the meeting on the 9th regarding the current situation and the party's new tasks. He analyzed the international and German situations in detail. He pointed out that the task facing the German people, led by the working class, is to make the struggle for signing a peace treaty with Germany and restoring German unity a cause for all the people, to consolidate the political power of the German Democratic Republic, and to successfully complete the huge construction work of the national Five-Year Plan. Ulbricht said that the Central Committee of the Party, based on the demands of the working people, suggested that the Congress study the issue of carrying out socialist planned construction in the German Democratic Republic.

    Ulbricht mentioned that since eastern Germany was liberated by the Soviet army, political power has been transferred from the hands of the bourgeoisie to the working people in urban and rural areas led by the working class. Currently, the working class of the German Democratic Republic plays a prominent role and has formed an alliance with the working peasants. Democratic state organs are being consolidated day by day. However, maintaining the old state form hinders the resolution of new tasks. At the same time, the two parts of the Republic's economy, the state-owned people's economy and the cooperative economy, have become a solid foundation for the new system. The proportion of the people's economy and the cooperative economy in the total industrial output accounted for 73.1 percent in 1950, 79.2 percent in 1951, and will reach 81 percent by the end of 1952. Ulbricht said, "The development of the democratic economy and the consciousness of the working class and the majority of the working people have reached such a level that socialist construction has become the fundamental task."

    Ulbricht emphasized: "The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and Berlin will only create favorable conditions for the struggle to establish a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany. We now, as before, adhere to our proposals for concluding a peace treaty and unifying Germany. As for what kind of social system will be established after the unification of all Germany, it will be resolved by all the German people without any external interference."

    The Congress held heated discussions on Ulbricht's report for several days. At the meeting on the 10th, Socialist Unity Party Chairman Pieck delivered a speech condemning the "General Treaty" and the European Army Treaty, explaining the new tasks of the German people in striving for peace and defending the German Democratic Republic.

    During the meeting, delegations of many workers and young people from all over Democratic Germany came to the meeting to pay tribute to the Congress. At the meeting on the 9th, Chairman Pieck read out congratulatory messages to the conference from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Labor Party, and others. The delegates and guests responded to these congratulatory messages with stormy applause.

    The conference finally re-elected the Central Committee members and Central Inspection Committee members of the German Socialist Unity Party and passed a resolution on "The Current Situation and the Party's Tasks in the Struggle for Peace, Unity, Democracy, and Socialism." The resolution emphasized that the central issue in Germany is the struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and restore German unity. Overthrowing the Bonn puppet regime is a prerequisite for restoring German unity.

    The conference closed with all the delegates singing the Internationale.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 15th: According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin: 500,000 workers in Berlin held a powerful demonstration on the 15th, expressing their determination to build socialism in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic districts of Berlin. This demonstration was to celebrate the Second Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party held in Berlin, and the slogan of the demonstration was also the central slogan of the Congress: "Advance in the struggle for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism!"

    The demonstrators marched in neat rows, passing through Marx-Engels Square for a full four and a half hours. Socialist Unity Party Chairman Pieck, Grotewohl, General Secretary Ulbricht, and German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann stood on the reviewing stand on the square, reviewing the demonstration. Also standing on the reviewing stand and the surrounding stands were delegates from various places attending the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party and foreign guests attending the meeting.

    Jendretzky, the First Secretary of the Greater Berlin District Party Organization of the Socialist Unity Party, announced that this demonstration was a pledge to the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party. It will call on all workers to do their best to work for the construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic districts of Berlin.

    德国统一社会党代表会议闭幕
    柏林五十万工人举行宣誓式示威拥护代表会议决议
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：七月九日在柏林开幕的德国统一社会党第二届代表会议，已于十二日闭幕。会议的中心口号是：“在争取和平、统一、民主和社会主义的斗争中前进！”
    统一社会党总书记乌布利希在九日会议上作了关于目前形势和党的新任务的长篇报告。他详尽地分析了国际及德国的形势。他指出，以工人阶级为首的德国人民所面临的任务是，使争取签订对德和约及恢复德国统一的斗争成为全体人民的事业，巩固德意志民主共和国的政权，并胜利地完成全国在实现五年计划中的巨大建设工作。乌布利希说：党中央委员会根据劳动人民的要求，建议代表会议研究在德意志民主共和国进行社会主义计划建设的问题。
    乌布利希提到：自从德国东部被苏军解放以后，政权已由资产阶级的手中转到了由工人阶级领导的城乡劳动人民手中。目前德意志民主共和国的工人阶级起着特出的作用，而且与劳动农民结成了联盟。民主的国家机构日益巩固。但是因为保持了旧的国家形式而使新任务的解决受到阻碍。同时，共和国经济中国有的人民经济和合作社经济的这两个部分，成了新制度稳固的基础。工业总产量中人民经济和合作社经济的成分在一九五○年占百分之七十三·一，一九五一年占百分之七十九·二，而到一九五二年底将达百分之八十一。乌布利希说，“民主经济的发展以及工人阶级和大多数劳动人民的觉悟已经达到了这样的水平，使社会主义建设成为基本的任务。”
    乌布利希着重指出：“德意志民主共和国和柏林的社会主义建设，对于为建立统一、民主、爱好和平和独立的德国的斗争说来，只会造成有利的条件。我们现在和以前一样坚持我们关于缔结和约和统一德国的建议。至于在全德国统一后将建立什么样的社会制度，则将由全体德国人民解决，不需任何外来的干涉。”
    代表会议就乌布利希的报告连日进行了热烈的讨论。十日会议上，统一社会党主席皮克发表演说，谴责“一般性条约”及欧洲军条约，说明德国人民争取和平和保卫德意志民主共和国的新任务。
    在会议进行期间，不断有民主德国各地许多工人和青年的代表团到会向代表会议致敬。在九日会议上，主席皮克宣读了中国共产党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党等致会议的贺电。代表们和来宾们对这些贺电报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    会议最后补选了德国统一社会党的中央委员与中央监察委员，并通过了关于“目前形势和党在争取和平、统一、民主和社会主义的斗争中的任务的决议”。决议着重指出：德国的中心问题就是为争取缔结对德和约与恢复德国统一而斗争。而推翻波恩傀儡政权是恢复德国统一的先决条件。
    会议在全体代表高唱国际歌声中闭幕。
    【新华社十五日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林消息：柏林五十万工人在十五日举行强有力的示威，表示他们准备在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区建设社会主义的决心。这次示威是为了庆祝在柏林举行的德国统一社会党第二届代表会议，示威的口号也就是代表会议的中心口号：“在争取和平、统一、民主和社会主义的斗争中前进！”
    示威者排着整齐的行列，经过马克思—恩格斯广场，足足走了四个半小时。德国统一社会党主席皮克、格罗提渥、总书记乌布利希和德国共产党主席雷曼站在广场上的检阅台上，检阅示威的队伍。站在检阅台上和周围观礼台上的还有出席统一社会党第二届代表会议的各地代表和列席会议的外国来宾。
    统一社会党大柏林区党组织第一书记詹德里茨基宣布：这次示威是对于统一社会党第二届代表会议的决议的一个宣誓式。它将号召一切工人竭尽全力为在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区建设社会主义而工作。
