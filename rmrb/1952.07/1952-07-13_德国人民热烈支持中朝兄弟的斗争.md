    The German People Warmly Support the Fraternal Struggle of China and Korea
    Germany Gelutena
    The German people warmly support the fraternal struggle of Korea and China.
    The German poet Kuba (Note: Kuba is the pen name of Kurt Bartel - Editor) visited the People's Republic of China last year and is tirelessly reporting to the German people, especially German youth, about the achievements and struggles of the Chinese people, and the heroic deeds in supporting the Korean people's war against American imperialist aggression. "The East is Burning" - Kuba named his travelogue this way. Now, this travelogue is being published serially in the newspaper of the Free German Youth League. In it, Kuba quoted a passage from his letter to Zhao Liang, a fighter of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea: "We Germans will spare no effort, and are willing to sacrifice sleep and shed our blood to support the kind of war you are waging, until final victory."
    This poet not only expressed his personal feelings, but also the heartfelt words of all peace-loving free German youth, and also the heartfelt words of many people in both East and West Germany.
    This kind of fighting friendship is very clearly expressed in Zhao Liang's reply to Kuba, which is not only to the poet, but also to the entire German people:
    "Although the distance between us is so far, we are moving in the same direction and fighting for a common goal.
    Since we have the assistance and support of peace fighters all over the world, just like the German people, will there be any invincible enemy?
    Dear comrade, victory belongs to our peace-loving people!"
    Two years have passed since the day the American imperialist aggressors attacked the peaceful residents of Korea. During these two years, the German people's movement to support Korea has expanded more and more widely. Under the influence of the news of the American imperialists' germ warfare and the atrocities of massacring prisoners of war on Koje Island, this movement has been further strengthened among people from all walks of life. Young Pioneers named their summer camp after Kim Il-sung; metal workers in Leipzig donated an ambulance. The number of relief supplies sent from all over Germany is constantly increasing. The wave of protest demonstrations against germ warfare and against the American atrocities of massacring prisoners of war is growing, and the number of people joining the united action is increasing day by day.
    At the same time, the German people are increasingly aware that the American executioners and their allies are also trying to subject Germany to the same fate as Korea. Therefore, the German people are doing their utmost to support the Korean people. The national issues of these two peoples are of the same type. The American war-mongers are trying to apply the same policies they used in Korea to Germany. The puppet government of Korea, Syngman Rhee, is playing the same trick that the Adenauer government is playing in West Germany. On May 26, Adenauer, following American orders, signed the "General Treaty," which is a plan to sell the West German people to the imperialist war-mongers and ultimately turn Germany into a battlefield.
    The best and strongest friend of our people—the great Soviet Union—shows us the way to effectively thwart war plans and maintain peace. Just as the Soviet Union resolutely strives for peace in Korea, the Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France specifically emphasized that the four powers should conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible based on the Soviet proposal. This is the way to peacefully resolve the German issue.
    At the huge patriotic mass meeting held recently in Berlin with the participation of a delegation from the Korean government, Premier Otto Grotewohl said:
    "The situation in Germany is very clear: either the four powers conclude a peace treaty with Germany - which is equivalent to peace; or Adenauer's 'General Treaty' - which is equivalent to establishing a military dictatorship in West Germany and increasing the risk of war.
    The German people and young people should realize the seriousness of the current situation, organize the armed self-defense of the German Democratic Republic to defend our homeland, our great construction cause, and our democratic state order, so as to avoid suffering the same fate as Korea." Under these circumstances, the German people particularly feel the necessity and responsibility to support the Korean people's heroic war for freedom. All peace-loving and patriotic German people have convinced the soldiers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers of their love, friendship, and solidarity.
    Long live our victorious struggle for peace!
    Long live the friendship between the nations of the invincible peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

    德国人民热烈支持中朝兄弟的斗争
    德国  葛鲁特纳
    德国人民热烈支持朝、中兄弟的斗争。
    德国诗人库巴（按：库巴是库特·巴特尔的笔名——编者）去年访问过中华人民共和国以后，正在不倦地向德国人民，特别是德国青年报道着中国人民的成就和斗争，以及在支援朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的战争中的英勇事迹。“东方在燃烧”——库巴就这样命名了自己的旅行记。现在，这个旅行记在自由德国青年联盟的报纸上陆续发表。其中库巴引用了他给在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士赵梁的信中的一段话：“我们德国人民决不吝惜任何精力，愿意牺牲睡眠，付出我们的鲜血来支持像你们所进行的这种战争，直到最后胜利。”
    这位诗人不仅说出了他个人的感情，而且说出了所有爱好和平的自由德国青年的心里的话，也是东西德境内许许多多人心里的话。
    这种战斗的友情，在赵梁给库巴的复信，不仅是给这位诗人，也可以说是给全体德国人民的复信中表现得非常清楚：
    “我们之间的距离虽然是这么遥远，但是我们却向着同一个方向迈进，为着一个共同的目的而斗争。
    既然我们有着正如德国人民一样的全世界和平
    战士的援助和支持，还会有不能战胜的敌人吗？
    亲爱的同志，胜利是属于我们爱好和平的人民的！”
    从美帝国主义侵略者向朝鲜和平居民进攻开始的那天起，已经两年过去了。在这两年中，德国人民支援朝鲜的运动日益广泛地展开了。在美帝国主义进行细菌战和在巨济岛上虐杀战俘的种种暴行的消息影响之下，这个运动在各界人民之间更为加强起来。少先队以金日成的名字来命名他们的夏令营；莱比锡市的金属工人捐献了一部救护车。由全德国各地送来救济品的数目不断在增加着。反对细菌战和反对美国虐杀战俘罪行的抗议示威的浪潮日益壮大，投入团结一致行动的人与日俱增。
    同时，德国人民日益认识清楚：美国刽子手及其同盟者也企图使德国遭到和朝鲜同样的命运。因此德国人民正在不遗余力地支援朝鲜人民。这两国人民的民族问题是属于同一类型的。美国战争贩子企图把他们在朝鲜所使用的同样的政策也用到德国来。朝鲜傀儡政府李承晚所扮演的把戏，阿登纳政府在西德正照样演出。五月二十六日阿登纳遵奉美国命令签署了“一般性条约”，就是准备把西德人民卖给帝国主义战争贩子，最后把德国变成战场的计划。
    我们各国人民的最好和最强的朋友——伟大的苏联指给我们能够有效地使战争计划破产并能维护和平的道路。正如苏联坚决地争取朝鲜的和平一样，苏联政府致美英法三国政府的照会中特别强调指出：四强以苏联的建议为根据与德国尽快地缔结和约，这就是和平解决德国问题的道路。
    最近在柏林举行的，有朝鲜政府代表团参加的规模巨大的爱国群众大会上，奥托·格罗提渥总理说：
    “德国的形势是非常清楚的：或者是四强对德缔结和约——这就等于和平；或者就是阿登纳的‘一般性条约’——就等于在西德建立军事独裁和增加战争危机。
    德国人民和青年们应当认识到目前形势的严重性，组织德意志民主共和国的武装自卫以保卫我们的家乡、我们伟大的建设事业和我们的民主国家秩序，以期使我们避免遭受和朝鲜同样的命运。”在这种情况下，德国人民特别感觉到有必要和责任去支援朝鲜人民的英勇的争取自由的战争。所有爱好和平和爱国的德国人民，已经使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战士和中国人民志愿军相信他们的热爱、友谊和团结。
    我们争取和平的胜利斗争万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的不可战胜的和平阵营各民族之间的友谊万岁！
