(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 9th via TASS) The General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, delivered a report at the party's Second Congress entitled "The Current Situation and New Tasks of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." Ulbricht said: The Second Party Congress is convened at a time when Germany is at a turning point in its development, and the German people, led by the working class, must undertake the cause of defending peace and restoring German unity on a democratic basis. Due to the firm will to defend peace to the end, a noble task arises—to make the struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of a unified, democratic Germany a cause for all the people, to consolidate the power of the German Democratic Republic—the foundation for the struggle for peace and German unity—and to victoriously complete the great construction work of the entire country in realizing the Five-Year Plan. The competition launched for the Second Party Congress and the earnest guarantees of workers, staff, technical intellectuals, and laboring peasants are manifestations of the great achievements we have obtained due to the clear policies of the Socialist Unity Party. A large part of Ulbricht's speech dealt with the characteristics of the current international situation. Speaking of the tasks of the German Democratic Republic's foreign policy, Ulbricht said:

	One, the struggle to defend peace, to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and to restore German unity on a democratic basis is the foundation of our foreign policy. We must relentlessly expose the war-mongers and all those who attempt to justify the preparation for a new war and the division of Germany.
	Two, we advocate conducting trade and establishing good-neighborly relations with all countries (including Western capitalist countries) on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Based on this principle, we rejected the Swiss government's proposal because, while it advocated establishing normal relations with the German Democratic Republic, it wanted us to acknowledge the debts owed by Hitler and to revise the Land Reform Law and the decrees confiscating enterprises formerly belonging to Nazis and war criminals.
	Three, in order to defend our peaceful policies, democratic progress, and the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic from Western aggression, we should take measures to strengthen our republic, consolidate and defend the republic's borders, and defend its democratic system and laws.
	Four, we want to consolidate and cherish the friendship with the Soviet Union—the fortress of peace, democracy, and socialism in the world—as we cherish the apple of our eye. We want to consolidate the friendship with the People's Republic of China and the People's Democracies of Europe and Asia, and to implement sincere, comradely, and multi-faceted cooperation with these countries to consolidate peace and build socialism. We want to be loyal to the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and to unswervingly implement the great Stalin's instruction that the friendship of all nations must be guaranteed.

Ulbricht pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has established an anti-fascist democratic system, in which the leading role is played by the working class in alliance with the laboring peasants and laboring intellectuals. The German Democratic Republic stands forever in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. It has been freed from the shackles of imperialism. Its peaceful economy has been restored, and new great tasks have been put forward in the Five-Year Plan to build a happy life for the people. The state power organs of the Republic serve the workers, peasants, and all laboring residents. All the achievements of science, culture, and technology are benefiting the laboring masses.

Ulbricht pointed out that, in contrast, West Germany is developing under the enslavement of American imperialism. West Germany's factories, banks, railways, and wealth belong to the big capitalists. Workers and peasants are suffering double oppression from foreign and West German big capitalists and landlords. American and West German imperialists are frantically carrying out arms expansion and want to turn West Germany into the main base for American aggression in Europe. West Germany now has an army of approximately three million unemployed and semi-unemployed.

Ulbricht emphasized that, under these circumstances, the residents of West Germany must launch a broad national liberation struggle in order to overthrow the Adenauer government and unite all patriotic forces to restore German unity regardless of the will of the imperialist countries.

Ulbricht then recounted that the government of the German Democratic Republic had proposed to the Bonn government to hold joint conferences to prepare for free, equal, secret, and democratic all-German national elections in order to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany; it had also proposed holding conferences to discuss how to quickly conclude a peace treaty with Germany and then completely withdraw all occupying forces from German territory. The Bonn government and the Bonn Parliament rejected these proposals. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the demands of the German Democratic Republic's government for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and instead signed separate treaties with the Bonn government.

Ulbricht emphasized that only the Soviet government has consistently supported the national and peaceful interests of the German people in the past and present. The Soviet Union's attitude is based on the German people's right to self-determination and the right to national and independent existence.

Ulbricht continued: The Soviet government's proposals regarding a peace treaty with Germany are entirely in line with the national interests of the German people and the interests of all peace-loving people. Those who oppose the treaty have no strong arguments to oppose this proposal. Therefore, they attempt to delay the time through long-term exchanges of notes, deepen the division of Germany, and complete the militarization of Germany. Ulbricht emphasized that the Bonn separate military treaty is a conspiracy between the revanchist ruling group in West Germany and some of the North Atlantic Treaty countries. The main purpose of this conspiracy is to drag West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc.

Ulbricht continued: The imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France, with the help of the reactionary West German big capital groups, have already formulated plans to enslave and plunder West Germany. The patriotic movement and the working class in West Germany are currently unable to prevent the signing of the Bonn separate treaty. However, McCloy, Adenauer, Blücher, and others can no longer disregard the strength of the people's resistance. Despite the repressive policies of the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party and the support of the West German trade union leaders for the policies of the Bonn government, the West German workers held large-scale strikes and demonstrations to protest the militarist military treaty. The Bonn separatists had to postpone the ratification of the separate treaty and take various measures to suppress the growing discontent of the residents. Therefore, Adenauer's supporters are calling for "meetings with the Soviet Union that do not hope to achieve results," which means that the meeting will immediately encounter a series of pre-planned obstacles, preventing the meeting from achieving any results. Schumacher's hypocritical opposition is also intended to support the US and British policies in West Germany and to prevent the residents from uniting against the Adenauer government. The US, British, and French imperialists and their manipulated West German Adenauer government formulate their plans without regard to the master, that is, without regard to the German people. No one with reason would allow Germany to be subjected to this separate Bonn treaty in the future. The West German residents' will to demand national self-defense will certainly overthrow the occupation rule consolidated by the separate Bonn treaty, and the West German residents will embark on the road of independent development. Although a part of the West German residents are still afraid of the American occupiers and their German lackeys today, the feeling of dissatisfaction is increasing day by day, and a situation has been formed in which the imperialist occupiers are hated by the residents every day, which is very dangerous for the foreign enslavers. There is no doubt that the working class and patriotic forces in West Germany will not tolerate this enslavement forever. They must do their best to get rid of American enslavement and jointly build an independent and free life with the working people of the German Democratic Republic.

Ulbricht then spoke in detail about the economic consequences of the Bonn government and Western countries signing a separate military treaty. He continued: The American ruling group believes that West German imperialism is the most aggressive force among the European capitalist countries, so it is prepared to give it special preference. … The separate treaty and the aggressiveness of West German militarism will sharpen the contradictions between capitalist countries. The people of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Britain do not want to participate in conflicts for the aggressive purposes of the United States, and even less for the revanchist demands of the German militarists. Ulbricht continued: The monopolistic capital forces of the German big bourgeoisie collude with American imperialism, but most of the small and medium bourgeoisie participate in the national liberation struggle against foreign occupiers and their Bonn lackeys.

Ulbricht continued: The national liberation struggle of the West German people against the US, British, and French occupiers, against the implementation of the "General Treaty," and for the conclusion of a peace treaty is in line with their vital interests. The national liberation movement has already achieved a series of considerable achievements. Ulbricht gave an example: More than nine million West German residents, regardless of the Adenauer government's terror tactics, expressed their opposition to militarization and their support for the conclusion of a peace treaty in the public opinion vote.

Ulbricht continued: We will continue to implement our policy of striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty and believe that the principles of the treaty proposed in the Soviet government's note are the principles for uniting all peaceful forces in Germany. We insist on our proposal that representatives from East and West Germany hold an all-German conference to prepare for free elections for the all-German National Assembly and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. We tell the bourgeois politicians that we are prepared to conduct proximity and support work in West Germany according to the extent to which West Germany now and in the future opposes the policies of the US, Britain, and France in enslaving West Germany. Due to the separate treaty, West Germany is bound to become the main military springboard for the United States in Europe. Therefore, in order to defend the motherland, in addition to the peace policy of the German Democratic Republic, it is necessary to establish armed forces. The establishment of national armed forces will give strong support to the people's movement in West Germany and increase their courage to fight for the overthrow of the Bonn puppet government.

When analyzing the situation of the German Social Democratic Party, Ulbricht pointed out the party's current crisis. He said that the crisis lies in the fact that the majority of the party members clearly expressed during the strikes and demonstrations in recent months that they demanded the unwavering implementation of a policy of actively fighting to protect the interests of the working people; they knew that the militarization of West Germany and the separate treaty would strengthen the position of the enemies of the working class in West Germany; they knew that after terrorist measures were taken against the communists, the rights of the trade unions would also be deprived. However, a small handful of right-wing Social Democratic leaders stand in opposition to this majority of German Social Democratic Party members. They have already compromised with the bourgeoisie and joined the camp of US, British, and West German imperialism.

Ulbricht said that after estimating the situation in West Germany, it can be seen that there is only one way to survive, and that is to launch a national liberation struggle under the leadership of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

Ulbricht then elaborated on the main stages of social and economic development in East Germany since the glorious Soviet army destroyed the Hitler fascist rule.

He recounted the main stages of demilitarization and democratization in the Soviet occupation zone in the first period after it was freed from Hitler fascist rule.

The tasks in the first stage after liberation were: to unite the working class and unite all democratic forces in order to carry the bourgeois democratic revolution to the end and eradicate German fascism. Ulbricht continued: After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, Germany began a new and important stage of development. It is clear that since East Germany was liberated by the Soviet army, its democratic, economic, and cultural development has been of a revolutionary transformation nature. In this transformation process, power has been transferred from the hands of the bourgeoisie to the hands of the urban and rural laboring people led by the working class.

Ulbricht said: At present, the working class in the German Democratic Republic plays a prominent role and has formed an alliance with the laboring peasants. Democratic state institutions are increasingly consolidated. However, the execution of new tasks is hindered because the old state form has been maintained. In the Republic's economy, the people's economy and the cooperative economy have become a solid foundation for the new system. In 1950, the people's economy and the cooperative economy accounted for 73.1 percent of the total industrial output value, 79.2 percent in 1951, and will reach 81 percent by the end of 1952. The agriculture of the German Democratic Republic is developing victoriously. Due to the extensive creativity of the laboring peasants, the expansion of the agricultural machinery station network, and the adoption of advanced working methods in agricultural technology science, the planned harvest targets are being overfulfilled. Agricultural workers, laboring peasants, and former immigrants in many rural areas are practicing collective farming voluntarily.

After Ulbricht pointed out that there are still many difficulties in the future democratic economic development of the German Democratic Republic, he said: "The development of the democratic economy and the awareness of the working class and the majority of the laboring people have reached such a level that socialist construction has become the basic task."

Ulbricht then elaborated in detail on the political and economic foundations for the transition of the German Democratic Republic to planned socialist construction, and also talked about the issue of political power and cultural construction in the German Democratic Republic during this period. Speaking of this, Ulbricht said about the German people's national struggle to establish a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany: "The national issue has always been the central issue from the past to the present, and this issue has profound social content. The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and Berlin will only create favorable conditions for the struggle to establish a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany. Now and as before, we insist on our proposals regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty and the unification of Germany. As for what kind of social system will be established after all of Germany is unified, it will be solved by all the German people, without any external interference. The construction of socialism will make it easier for the German working class and all the laboring people to solve the issue of the future German social system, because everyone can draw conclusions based on their own experience: Which road is in line with the interests of the laboring people, and which road serves the interests of the arms tycoons, capitalists, and landlords. Our policy of developing democracy and building socialism will definitely shatter the plans of the Adenauer group and the big capitalists who support it. After laying the socialist foundation in the German Democratic Republic, it will help the brothers of the American monopoly capital in Bonn—the concerns and bank bosses in West Germany—suffer a decisive defeat. Let the laboring residents of West Germany and all peace-loving people believe in the reality of our socialist construction!"

After Ulbricht pointed out the vote-garnering remarks of the Schumacher elements that they were determined to achieve socialism, he emphasized: All workers can now compare the lies of the West German Social Democratic leaders with the construction of the new social system led by the German Socialist Unity Party.

A considerable part of Ulbricht's report involved the work of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Ulbricht said: In order to implement the victorious struggle of the Five-Year Plan determined by our party, deepen the study of Marxism-Leninism, review party members, and the decision of the Party Central Committee on launching criticism and self-criticism: all this has helped improve the level of party affairs work and enabled us to gain considerable achievements in winning the support of the masses for the party's policies.

Ulbricht said at the end of the report: The Second Party Congress will adopt a program for the struggle for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism, and a program for the struggle for the happy life of our people. The forces of peace and progress in Germany are bound to win, because our cause is the cause of the working class and all progressive forces. We are bound to win, because our policy of striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty and striving for the unification of Germany is in line with the vital interests of the country. We are bound to win, because the road of struggle for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism can bring people a happy life. We are bound to win, because our party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, is a new type of party, the most powerful party in Germany, and a party that uses the scientific theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as a guide. We are bound to win, because we are united with the national liberation struggles of the peoples of the colonies and dependencies. We are bound to win, because we have good friends: the people of the Soviet Union who have completed socialist construction, and the people of the People's Democratic countries who are building socialism.

Long live the struggle to establish a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany!
Long live the liberation struggle of the German people against the enslavement of US and British imperialism and their Bonn lackeys!
Long live the common struggle of all peace-loving and patriotic Germans to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty and restore German unity!
Long live the German Democratic Republic! Long live President Pieck!
Long live the struggle to build socialism in the German Democratic Republic!
Long live proletarian international solidarity!
Long live the lasting and unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union—our liberator!
Long live our wise mentor, the standard-bearer of world peace and progress, the great Stalin!
(At this time, all the participants stood up and cheered enthusiastically for a long time.) (Includes picture)

    在德国统一社会党二届代表会议上
    乌布利希关于目前形势和统一社会党的新任务的报告摘要
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社柏林九日讯：德国统一社会党总书记乌布利希在该党第二届代表会议上作了
    “目前形势和统一社会党的新任务”的报告。乌布利希说：第二届党代表会议是在这样一个时候召开的，这时德国处在发展的转折关头，以工人阶级为首的德国人民必须把保卫和平的事业、把在民主的基础上恢复德国统一的事业担当起来。由于要把和平保卫到底的坚决意志，就产生了一项崇高的任务——使争取签订和约及恢复民主德国统一的斗争成为全体人民的事业，巩固德意志民主共和国——为和平及德国的统一而斗争的基础——的政权，并胜利地完成全国在实现五年计划中的巨大建设工作。为第二届党代表会议而展开的竞赛，工人、职员、技术知识分子以及劳动农民认真的保证，是我们由于统一社会党明确的政策所获得的巨大成就的表现。乌布利希的演说有很大一部分是讲目前国际形势的特点。谈到德意志民主共和国的外交政策的任务时，乌布利希说：
    一、为保卫和平、争取缔结对德和约、在民主的基础上恢复德国统一而斗争，是我们外交政策的基础。必须无情地揭露战争贩子以及所有试图为准备新战争、为分裂德国而辩解的人的一切手段。
    二、我们主张与一切国家（包括西方资本主义国家在内）在平等互利的基础上进行贸易、并建立睦邻关系。根据这个原则，我们拒绝了瑞士政府的建议，因为它虽然主张和德意志民主共和国建立正常关系，但却要我们承认希特勒所欠下的债务，要我们修改土地改革法和没收以前属于纳粹分子和战犯的企业的法令。
    三、为了保卫我们的和平政策、民主进步和德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设不受西方侵略，我们应该采取措施加强我们的共和国，巩固并保卫共和国边疆，保卫它的民主制度和法律。
    四、我们要巩固并要像爱护眼珠一样地爱护对苏联——世界的和平、民主和社会主义的堡垒——的友谊。我们要巩固对中华人民共和国、对欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家的友谊，并和这些国家实行真诚的同志般的多方面的合作，以巩固和平及建设社会主义。我们要忠于马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的旗帜，要始终不渝地实现伟大的斯大林关于必须保证各国人民友谊的指示。
    乌布利希指出：德意志民主共和国建立了反法西斯民主制度，其中起领导作用的是与劳动农民及劳动知识分子结成联盟的工人阶级。德意志民主共和国永远站在和平、民主和社会主义的阵营中。它已摆脱了帝国主义的奴役。它的和平经济已经恢复了，在五年计划中已经提出了新的建设人民幸福生活的伟大任务。共和国的国家权力机关是为工人、农民及所有的劳动居民服务的。科学、文化和技术的全部成就都在替劳动大众造福。
    乌布利希指出：与此相反，西德却是在美帝国主义进行奴役的情况下发展着。西德的工厂、银行、铁路和财富都属于大资本家。工人和农民遭受着外国和西德的大资本家和大地主的双重压迫。美国和西德帝国主义者正在疯狂地进行武装，要把西德变成美国侵略欧洲的主要基地。西德现在约有三百万失业和半失业大军。
    乌布利希着重指出：在这种情况下，西德居民必须广泛展开民族解放斗争，以便推翻阿登纳政府，并团结一切爱国力量不顾帝国主义国家的意志而恢复德国的统一。
    乌布利希接着追述道：德意志民主共和国政府曾向波恩政府建议举行联合会议筹备自由、平等、不记名、民主的全德国民议会选举，以建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国；也曾建议举行会议，讨论如何从速缔结对德和约，然后把所有的占领军全部撤出德国领土的问题。波恩政府和波恩议会拒绝了这些建议。美、英、法三国政府反对德意志民主共和国政府主张缔结对德和约的要求，反而和波恩政府签订了单独条约。
    乌布利希强调指出：只有苏联政府过去和现在一直支持德国人民的民族和平利益。苏联的态度是以德国人民有自决权和国家独立生存权为出发点。
    乌布利希继称：苏联政府关于对德和约的建议是完全符合德国人民的民族利益和一切爱好和平人民的利益的。反对和约的人没有任何有力的论据来反对这个建议。因此他们便企图用长期交换照会的办法来拖延时间，加深德国的分裂，并完成德国的军国主义化。乌布利希强调称：波恩单独军事条约是西德复仇主义统治集团和一些北大西洋公约国家的共谋。这个共谋的主要目的是要把西德拖进侵略性的北大西洋集团里去。
    乌布利希继称：美、英、法等国的帝国主义者在反动的西德大资本集团的帮助下，已经制订了奴役和掠夺西德的计划。西德的爱国运动和工人阶级目前还无力阻止波恩单独条约的签字。但是，麦克洛埃、阿登纳、布吕契等人已经再不能不顾及人民群众反抗的力量了。西德工人大众不管德国社会民主党领袖的压制政策和西德工会领袖对波恩政府政策的支持，举行了大规模的罢工和示威游行，抗议军国主义的军事条约。波恩的分裂主义者不得不延期批准单独条约，采取各种手段来抑制居民日益增涨的不满情绪。因此，阿登纳的支持者要求举行有苏联参加的“不望获得结果的会议”，这就是说，这个会议将会立即遭到一连串事先拟好的阻碍，使会议不能获得任何结果。舒马赫采取假惺惺的反对态度也同样是为了支持美英在西德的政策，并阻止居民团结起来反对阿登纳政府。美、英、法帝国主义者及其所操纵的西德阿登纳政府目无主人、即目无德国人民地制订他们的计划。没有一个有理智的人会允许德国将来服从这个单独波恩条约。西德居民要求民族自卫的意志一定可以推翻为单独波恩条约所巩固下来的占领统治，西德居民一定会走上独立发展的道路。虽然今天一部分西德居民仍然害怕美国占领者及其德国走狗，但是不满的情绪却日益增强，已经形成这样的局势：帝国主义占领者每天都遭到居民仇视，这一点对外国奴役者说来是非常危险的。毫无疑问，西德的工人阶级和爱国力量不会永远忍受这种奴役，他们一定要尽全力来摆脱美国的奴役，并和德意志民主共和国的劳动人民共同建设独立、自由的生活。
    乌布利希接着详细地谈到波恩政府和西方各国签订单独军事条约所产生的经济后果。他继称：美国统治集团认为西德帝国主义是欧洲资本主义国家中最富侵略性的力量，因此，准备对它特别垂青。……单独条约和西德军国主义的侵略性将使资本主义国家间的矛盾尖锐化。法国、比利时、荷兰、意大利和英国的人民不愿为了美国的侵略目的，更不愿为了德国军国主义者的复仇要求而参与冲突。乌布利希继称：德国大资产阶级的垄断资本力量和美帝国主义狼狈为奸，可是大部分中小资产阶级却参加了民族解放斗争，反对外国占领者及他们的波恩走狗。
    乌布利希继称：西德人民反对美、英、法三国占领者、反对实行“一般性条约”、争取缔结和约的民族解放斗争是符合他们的切身利益的。民族解放运动已经获得了一系列相当大的成就。乌布利希并举例说：九百余万西德居民不管阿登纳政府的恐怖手段，在民意投票中表示反对军国主义化，赞成缔结和约。
    乌布利希继称：我们将继续执行我们争取缔结和约的政策，并认为苏联政府照会中建议的和约原则是团结德国一切和平力量的原则。我们坚持我们的建议，主张东西德代表举行全德会议以准备全德国民议会自由选举及缔结对德和约。我们告诉资产阶级的政客们，我们准备按照西德现在和将来对美、英、法诸国奴役西德的政策进行反对的程度，进行亲近西德和支持西德的工作。由于单独条约，西德势必变成美国在欧洲的主要军事跳板。因此，为了保卫祖国，除德意志民主共和国的和平政策外，必须建立武装部队。建立民族武装部队会给西德的人民运动以强力的支持，并增加他们为推翻波恩附庸政府而斗争的勇气。
    乌布利希在分析德国社会民主党的情况时指出该党目前的危机。他说，这个危机在于：该党的大部分党员在最近几个月的罢工和示威游行过程中明白表示，他们要求坚持不渝地实行为保卫劳动人民利益而积极斗争的政策；他们知道，西德的军国主义化和单独条约会加强工人阶级的敌人在西德的阵地；他们知道，对共产党员采取恐怖手段后，工会的权利也将被剥夺。但是一小撮右翼社会民主党的头子却和这大多数的德国社会民主党员站在对立的地位，他们已经和资产阶级妥协，加入了美、英、西德帝国主义的阵营。
    乌布利希说，对西德局势加以估计后便可以看出来：求生的道路只有一条，那就是在民主德国全国阵线领导下展开民族解放斗争。
    乌布利希接着阐述了自从光荣的苏军摧毁了希特勒法西斯统治以后，东德社会和经济发展的主要阶段。
    他追述了苏占区在摆脱希特勒法西斯统治后的第一个时期中主要的非军国主义化和民主化的阶段。
    解放后第一个阶段的任务是：团结工人阶级并联合一切民主力量，以便把资产阶级民主革命进行到底，并根除德国法西斯主义。乌布利希继称：德意志民主共和国成立后，德国就开始了一个新的、重要的发展阶段。显然，东德自从被苏军解放后，它的民主、经济、文化各方面的发展是具有一种革命转变的性质，在这个转变过程中，政权由资产阶级的手中转到了工人阶级领导的城乡劳动人民的手中。
    乌布利希说：目前德意志民主共和国的工人阶级起着突出的作用，而且和劳动农民结成了联盟。民主的国家机构日益巩固。但因为保持了旧的国家形式，而使新任务的执行受到阻碍。在共和国的经济中，人民经济和合作社经济这两个部分成了新制度稳固的基础。一九五○年在工业总产量中人民经济和合作社经济两部分占百分之七十三点一，一九五一年占百分之七十九点二，而到一九五二年底则将达百分之八十一。德意志民主共和国的农业胜利地发展着。由于劳动农民广泛发挥了创造性，由于扩大了农业机器站网，采用了农业技术科学的先进工作法，原定的收获计划超额完成着。许多农村的农业工人、劳动农民和从前的移民都根据自愿实行集体耕种。
    乌布利希指出德意志民主共和国今后民主经济发展中还存在着许多困难后说：“民主经济的发展以及工人阶级和大多数劳动人民的觉悟已经达到这样的水平，使社会主义建设成为基本的任务。”
    乌布利希接着详尽地阐述了德意志民主共和国过渡到有计划的社会主义建设这方面的政治和经济基础的问题，也谈到了德意志民主共和国在这段时期中政权和文化建设的问题。谈到这里，乌布利希就德国人民为建立统一、民主、和平与独立的德国而进行的民族斗争说：“民族问题从过去到现在一直是中心问题，这个问题具有深刻的社会内容。德意志民主共和国和柏林的社会主义建设，对于建立统一、民主、和平和独立的德国的斗争来说，只会造成有利的条件。现在和以前一样我们坚持我们关于缔结和约和统一德国的建议。至于在全德国统一后将建立什么样的社会制度，则将由全体德国人民解决，不需任何外来的干涉。社会主义的建设将使德国工人阶级和全体劳动人民容易解决今后德国社会制度的问题，因为每个人都可以根据自己的经验得出结论：哪一条道路符合劳动人民的利益，哪一条道路是为军火大王、资本家和大地主的利益服务的。我们发展民主和建设社会主义的政策一定可以粉碎阿登纳集团及为它撑腰的大资本家的计划。在德意志民主共和国奠定社会主义基础后，将有助于使美国垄断资本在波恩的兄弟——西德的康采恩和银行老板遭受决定性的失败。让西德的劳动居民和所有爱好和平的人相信我们社会主义建设的现实性吧！”
    乌布利希指出舒马赫分子所谓他们志在社会主义的那种笼络人心的言论后，强调称：所有的工人现在都可以把西德社会民主党头子们的谎言和德国统一社会党领导的新社会制度的建设作一番比较。
    乌布利希的报告以相当大的部分涉及德国统一社会党的工作问题。乌布利希说：为了实行我们党所决定的五年计划的胜利斗争，加深对马克思—列宁主义的研究，党员的审查，党中央关于展开批评与自我批评的决定：这一切都帮助了党务工作水平的提高，并且使我们在争取群众拥护党的政策上获得了相当大的成绩。
    乌布利希在报告的结尾说：第二届党代表会议要通过为和平、统一、民主及社会主义而斗争的纲领，为我们人民幸福的生活而斗争的纲领。德国的和平与进步力量必定胜利，因为我们的事业就是工人阶级和一切进步力量的事业。我们必定胜利，因为我们争取缔结和约，争取统一德国的政策是符合全国切身利益的。我们必定胜利，因为争取和平、统一、民主和社会主义的斗争道路可以使人民获得幸福的生活。我们必定胜利，因为我们的党，德国统一社会党，已是一个新型的党，是德国最强有力的党，是以马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的科学理论为指针的党。我们必定胜利，因为我们和殖民地、附属国人民的民族解放斗争是团结一致的。我们必定胜利，因为我们有很好的朋友：已经完成社会主义建设的苏联人民，和正在建设社会主义的人民民主国家的人民。
    争取建立统一、民主、和平、独立的德国的斗争万岁！
    德国人民为反对美英帝国主义及其波恩走狗的奴役而进行的解放斗争万岁！
    所有爱好和平与爱国的德国人为争取缔结和约、恢复德国统一而共同进行的斗争万岁！
    德意志民主共和国万岁！皮克总统万岁！
    为在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义而斗争万岁！
    无产阶级国际团结万岁！
    对苏联——我们的解放者——持久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    我们英明的导师、世界和平与进步的旗手、伟大的斯大林万岁！
    （此时，与会者全体起立，热烈欢呼，经久不息。）（附图片）
