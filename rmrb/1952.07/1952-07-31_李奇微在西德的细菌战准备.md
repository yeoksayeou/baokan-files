Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 30th (TASS): According to a Deutsche Press Agency (DPA) report from Bonn on the 26th, the West German "Blank Office" (actually the West German War Ministry), under orders from Ridgway's headquarters, has begun registering former military biochemists and bacteriologists in West Germany. All bacteriological institutes and laboratories in West Germany are also being registered and inventoried. It is also learned that the West German military biochemists and bacteriologists registered by the "Blank Office" must be trained at the U.S. occupation forces' chemical laboratory in Hanau before being transferred to special forces of the "European Army."

In addition, the "Blank Office" recently, at Ridgway's request, submitted to him a 500-page report on the development of German military bacteriological science before the end of World War II.
