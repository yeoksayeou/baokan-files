The Northeast China Power System has learned, created, and promoted various advanced experiences in recent years, initially realizing the potential of power equipment and reducing the cost of electricity. Among these advanced experiences, the more important ones are: load adjustment, electricity conservation, rapid overhaul, unified overhaul, and using low-quality coal for power generation. The Northeast China Electric Power Administration plans to further promote these advanced experiences in this year's production increase and economy practice campaign, as the main method to ensure the completion of this year's production increase and economy plan and to fully supply electricity.

    Load adjustment is an important method to improve the utilization rate of power equipment and realize the potential of the power industry. As early as August last year, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration formulated five methods for load adjustment and instructed its subordinate bureaus to implement them. These five methods are: (1) Employees of large power users who originally rested on Sundays should take rest in rotation to reduce the weekday power load; (2) Factories with two shifts should change their work hours to stagger the evening shift work time with urban lighting time, in order to reduce the daily peak power load; (3) Discontinuous operation equipment should be used during low load times, and electricity should be avoided as much as possible during peak power load times; (4) The production time of one-shift factories should not overlap with the peak load time; (5) Ordinary household electricity use should be shifted to outside the peak load time. After adopting these five methods, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration adjusted 30,000 kilowatts of power last winter, which is equivalent to increasing the country's power generation equipment by 40,000 kilowatts, thereby making the power load in the high-voltage power grid increasingly balanced, and the load factor increased from 84.5 percent before the adjustment to 93.2 percent.

    Electricity conservation was proposed in this year's "Three-Anti" movement, and it has already achieved significant results. For example, in terms of canceling non-productive electric heating, thanks to the active response of general household users, 20,000 kilowatts of electricity have been saved. In terms of electric lighting, government offices alone saved 2 million kilowatt-hours in the first quarter of this year. Saving power for machinery has also begun to be implemented in a few factories. After adopting measures such as adjusting circuit and equipment capacity and installing electrostatic accumulators, Machinery Factory No. 2 saved 27 percent of its original electricity consumption.

    The rapid overhaul method was first implemented by the Fushun Power Plant. In February of this year, the plant used the rapid overhaul method to overhaul Boiler No. 12, which shortened the overhaul time by 32.7 percent compared to the original plan, and by 41.3 percent compared to last year, and increased the boiler efficiency from 64.7 percent to 75.8 percent. Subsequently, Dalian Power Plant, Yingkou Power Bureau and other units also successively tried the rapid overhaul method. When overhauling certain equipment, the original planned period for Dalian Power Plant was 30 days. As a result of trying the rapid overhaul method, all overhauls were completed in only four days. The implementation of the rapid overhaul method greatly increased the effective power supply time of the power industry. According to the estimate of the Northeast China Electric Power Administration, if the rapid overhaul method is widely used in the Northeast China during this year's overhauls, all overhaul work can be completed in the third quarter in advance, so that this winter, when the demand for electricity reaches its peak, there will be sufficient standby power to ensure power supply.

    While implementing the rapid overhaul method, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration further implemented the unified overhaul method, so that the overhaul work of the equipment inside the power bureau and the overhaul work of the equipment used by factories and mines can be carried out simultaneously. This can overcome the shortcomings of increasing power outages due to uncoordinated overhauls, and fully utilize the electricity. According to the 1951 statistics, the Northeast China Power System lacked a unified overhaul plan, resulting in more than 2,400 power outages for overhauls, totaling more than 15,300 hours, of which 52 percent were unplanned temporary power outages. The loss of electricity at this time was very large. In March of this year, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration first promoted "unified and coordinated overhaul" in Anshan Electric Power Bureau, which resulted in a reduction in the number of power outages, a shortening of overhaul time, and an increase in electricity sales of 120,000 kilowatt-hours, while also increasing the production value of several factories and mines that cooperated in the unified overhaul by 3.3 billion yuan.

    Using low-quality coal for power generation is a basic method to reduce the cost of thermal power generation. In thermal power plants, 40 to 50 percent of the cost of electricity is spent on fuel. In the past, power plants in the Northeast all used high-quality coal for power generation, while a large amount of low-quality coal was piled up in coal mines, or discarded, or used for other purposes. This not only increased the cost of electricity, but also caused a large waste of national resources. Last year, after the power plants in Benxi, Fushun, Fuxin, Xi'an, Jixi and other places successively succeeded in using low-quality coal for power generation, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government issued instructions requiring power plants to burn as much low-quality coal as possible produced in local or nearby mining areas. Up to now, 70 percent of the thermal power plants in the Northeast have used low-quality coal, and 38 percent of the thermal power plants have used 100 percent low-quality coal for power generation. As a result of using low-quality coal for power generation, the Jixi Power Plant can save more than 20 billion yuan in one year.

    Now the Northeast China Electric Power Administration has formulated specific plans and measures, and is preparing to further vigorously promote these advanced experiences in this year's production increase and economy practice campaign. For example, in terms of load adjustment and electricity conservation, they have planned to further discover tens of thousands of kilowatts of power, and have formulated contact methods for load adjustment and inspection methods for electricity conservation. Through these methods, the work of saving electricity and adjusting load in factories and mines and power bureaus can form a regular work system. Regarding the rapid overhaul method, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration has already issued a promotion decision, requiring comprehensive promotion within the power system. It has also made demonstrative promotions in several overhaul projects of some power plants. Now, according to the experience of each plant in implementing the rapid overhaul method, the Northeast China Electric Power Administration has re-compiled the progress schedule of the major equipment overhaul projects of power generation, transmission, and substation in the second half of 1952. According to this progress schedule, the rapid overhaul method is implemented, and the overhaul date of the boiler can be shortened by an average of one-quarter, and the overhaul date of the turbine generator can be shortened by one-third. In the second half of the year, the maximum output in the ultra-high-voltage power grid will increase by an average of tens of thousands of kilowatts compared with the original plan.

    东北电业系统大力推广五种先进经验
    东北电业系统几年来已学习、创造和推广了多种先进经验，初步发挥了电力设备的潜在力量，降低了电的成本。这许多先进经验中，较重要的有：调整负荷、节约用电、快速检修、统一检修、劣煤发电等。东北电业管理局准备在今年增产节约运动中把这些先进经验再进一步推广，作为保证完成今年增产节约计划和充分供应电量的主要方法。
    调整负荷是提高电力设备利用率，发挥电业潜在力量的重要方法。早在去年八月东北电业管理局就制订出五项调整负荷的办法，由所属各局贯彻执行。这五项办法是：（一）大电力用户职工由原来都在星期日休息，改为轮流休息，以减少平日的电力负荷；（二）两班制的工厂改变作业时间，把晚班作业时间和城市照明时间错开，以降低每日的电力最高负荷；（三）不连续运转的设备改在低负荷时间使用，尽量避免在电力最大负荷时间用电；
    （四）一班制工厂生产时间，不要和负荷最大时间重叠；（五）普通户用电改在最大负荷时间以外。采用这五项办法后，东北电业管理局已在去年冬季调整出三万瓩的电力，等于为国家增加四万瓩的发电设备，从而使高压电力网内电力负荷日趋平衡，负荷率由调整前的百分之八十四点五提高到百分之九十三点二。
    节约用电是在今年“三反”运动中提出来的，现在已有显著成绩。如在取消非生产的电热用电方面，由于一般家庭用户的积极响应，已节约了二万瓩的电力；在电灯用电方面，仅机关用电在今年第
    一季度中就节约了两百万度；节约动力用电也在少数工厂开始实行，机械二厂采取了调整线路及设备容量、安装静电蓄电器等措施后，就比原用电量节约了百分之二十七。
    快速检修法首先实行的是抚顺发电厂。该厂在今年二月利用快速检修法检修了十二号锅炉，使检修时间比原计划缩短了百分之三十二点七，比去年缩短了百分之四十一点三，并使锅炉效率由百分之六十四点七提高到百分之七十五点八。接着，大连发电厂、营口电业局等单位也都先后试行了快速检修法。大连发电厂在检修某些设备时，原计划期限是三十天，试用快速检修法的结果，仅四天工夫就全部检修完毕。快速检修法的实施大大增加了电力工业有效供电的时间。据东北电业管理局估计，如果今年东北在检修中普遍使用快速检修法，全部检修工作将可提前在第三季度完成，这样在今年冬季，当电的需要量达到最高点时，就能有充分的备用电源来保证供电。
    在实行快速检修法的同时，东北电业管理局还进一步实行了统一检修法，使电业局内部设备的检修工作和厂矿使用电力的设备检修工作同时进行，这样可以克服因不同时检修而增加停电次数的缺点，使电力得到充分利用。根据一九五一年统计，东北电业系统由于缺乏统一检修计划，停电检修达两千四百余次，共一万五千三百余小时，其中百分之五十二都是计划外的临时停电，这时电量的损失是很大的。今年三月，东北电业管理局在鞍山电业局首先推行“统一配合检修”，结果减少了停电次数，缩短了检修时间，从而增加卖电量达十二万度，同时并使几个配合统一检修的厂矿增加生产的价值达三十三亿元。
    利用劣煤发电是降低火力发电成本的一个基本方法。在火力发电厂中，电的成本百分之四十到五十是用在燃料上。过去东北各发电厂都是使用好煤发电，而大量的劣煤都被堆积在煤矿里，或被丢弃，或被移作他用。这样不仅提高了电的成本，而且造成国家资源的大量浪费。去年本溪、抚顺、阜新、西安、鸡西等地发电厂先后试烧劣煤发电获得成功后，东北人民政府工业部即发出指示，要求各发电厂尽量燃烧当地或邻近矿区所产的劣煤。到目前为止，东北已有百分之七十的火力发电厂使用了劣煤，其中百分之三十八的火力发电厂并已百分之百地用劣煤发电。使用劣煤发电的结果，鸡西发电厂在一年中就可节省二百余亿元。
    现在东北电业管理局已制订出具体计划和措施，准备在今年的增产节约运动中更进一步大力推广这些先进经验。如在调整负荷，节约用电方面，他们已计划再挖掘出数万瓩的电力，并已制定了调整负荷联系办法和节约用电检查办法。通过这些办法，厂矿和电业局的节约用电和调整负荷工作可以形成经常工作制度。关于快速检修法，东北电业管理局早已发布了推广决定，要求在电业系统内全面推广。并已在某些发电厂的几项检修工程中作了示范性推广。现在东北电业管理局，又根据各厂实施快速检修法的经验，重新编制了一九五二年下半年的发电、送电、变电等主要设备检修工程进度表，按照这个进度表实行快速检修法，锅炉的检修日期平均可以缩短四分之一，透平发电机检修日期可以缩短三分之一。下半年超高压电力网内最大出力将比原计划平均增加数万瓩的电力。（新华社）
