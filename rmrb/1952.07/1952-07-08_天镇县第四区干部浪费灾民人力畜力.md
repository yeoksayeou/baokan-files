    Cadres in the Fourth District of Tianzhen County Waste Disaster Victims' Labor and Livestock Power

    Editor: Yang Fushun, the financial assistant in the Fourth District of Tianzhen County, Chahar Province, led more than 300 cadres and villagers from over 20 administrative villages in the disaster area, along with more than 120 carts and 130 heads of donkeys, cattle, and mules, to the county general warehouse to collect disaster relief grain on the afternoon of June 14th. He had not completed the grain collection procedures with the county finance department beforehand. After everyone arrived at the location of the county general warehouse, he told the people at the grain depot that he was going to the finance department to complete the procedures. Director Tian of the grain depot, fearing a delay in the villagers' grain collection, called the finance department around 5:00 PM that day, urging him to complete the procedures quickly. However, Yang Fushun did not go to the finance department that day and went home privately. On the morning of the 15th, the villagers gathered at the grain depot to collect grain. It was not until around 1:00 PM that Yang Fushun arrived at Qianbao and told the villagers: "The disaster relief registers in the Fourth District are not stamped with the disaster victims' fingerprints, and the finance department will not issue the grain." He told the villagers to take their carts and livestock back, and come again after completing the procedures. The disaster victims were very dissatisfied with this matter and criticized the district government one after another. At that time, except for four villages that directly completed the procedures at the county finance department and received grain from the grain depot, the rest had to return empty-handed. It was not until June 17th that the villages completed the procedures and successively came to the grain depot to collect grain.

    Currently, Chahar Province is distributing disaster relief grain to support the production of people in the disaster areas and solve the livelihood of disaster victims. The broad masses of disaster-stricken people are very grateful for this measure of the Communist Party and the People's Government. The masses unanimously reflected:

    "If it hadn't been for Chairman Mao's concern for us last year when we suffered a disaster, and his sending grain to relieve us, things would have been very difficult." Governments at all levels in Chahar Province have included the distribution of disaster relief grain as a major task. However, the Fourth District of Tianzhen County was so irresponsible in the work of distributing disaster relief grain, wasting a large amount of labor and livestock power of the people in the disaster area. We suggest that the leading organs of Tianzhen County quickly investigate and affix responsibility.

### 天镇县第四区干部浪费灾民人力畜力

    天镇县第四区干部浪费灾民人力畜力
    编辑同志：察哈尔省天镇县第四区财政助理员杨福顺，在六月十四日下午带领区里二十几个灾区行政村的干部、群众三百多人，大车一百二十多辆，驴、牛、骡子等一百三十几头，到县总库领救灾粮。他事先并没有向县财政科办好领粮手续，大家到了县总库所在地以后，他才对粮库的人说，他要到财政科去办手续。粮库田主任怕耽误群众领粮，在当天下午五时曾往财政科打电话，催他快办，可是杨福顺当天并没有到财政科，竟私自回家去了。到十五日早晨，群众齐集粮库领粮。直到下午一时左右，杨福顺才到前堡来，向群众说：“四区的救灾册子上没有盖灾民手印，财政科不给发。”让群众带着车和牲畜回去，等补完手续再来领。灾民对这件事非常不满，纷纷指摘区政府。当时除有四个村直接到县财政科办好手续，由粮库领了粮食以外，其余都只好空车回去了。直到六月十七日，各村才补完手续，陆续来粮库领粮。
    目前，察哈尔省正在发放救灾粮，以扶持灾区群众生产和解决灾民生活。广大的受灾群众对共产党和人民政府这种措施，非常感激。群众一致反映：
    “去年咱们受了灾，要不是毛主席关心咱们，运粮来救济，可不好过哩。”察哈尔省各级政府都把发放救灾粮列入主要工作。可是天镇县第四区在发放救灾粮的工作上却这样不负责任，浪费了灾区人民的大批人力畜力。我们建议天镇县的领导机关，赶快调查，追究责任。
