    Learning Through Combat
    Zhu Shilin
    The heroic qualities of the People's Liberation Army soldiers when they fought to liberate the motherland in the past are now displaying new brilliance in the army-wide cultural learning movement to build a strong, modernized national defense force. On the eve of "August 1st" [Army Day], I visited a battalion of the Air Force. After a short period of study, this battalion had completely eliminated illiteracy. Now, they have entered a long-term, regular cultural learning program.
    To help me understand more clearly, the battalion's political instructor showed me a portion of the soldiers' recent cultural learning assignments—more than 500 manuscripts and Grade A class compositions. This was the first time the soldiers had used words to express their rich, detailed, and pure emotions after undergoing accelerated literacy learning.
    There were articles as long as eight or nine hundred words; letters to the people's leaders; lively poems and rhythmic quick verse; short essays recounting combat experiences and recalling the bitter life of the past; and personal pledges to stand forever on the front lines of national defense. When I read these works, I was amazed by the soldiers' ability to express their thoughts and feelings; I was moved by the soldiers' deep love for the motherland, hatred of the enemy, and their spirit of courageously advancing and overcoming all difficulties. I felt even more that they were admirable and lovable!
    In a poem by Hu Weimin, the following records their own learning situation:
    The bell rings, everyone walks in groups of three or five, carrying stationery and textbooks, striding into the classroom. Who cares about the violent wind and rain, who cares about the scorching sun, one by one is in high spirits, the will of the People's soldiers is iron and steel. Although there are many difficulties, as long as Chairman Mao gives an order, we will shout "Charge!" Eliminate all illiteracy.
    During the Liberation War, this battalion was always active in the Jiaozuo area of ​​Pingyuan Province, protecting and expanding the liberated areas. When the motherland called for the construction of a strong People's Air Force, this battalion participated in the construction of the People's Air Force. Facing new things, they felt even more the importance of culture to them.
    Before the learning began, Comrade Qi Jianhua, the creator of the accelerated literacy method, gave a report to the soldiers. Qi Jianhua's confident expression and his unquestionable words deeply moved the soldiers' hearts. They muttered loudly, "This method works!"; Just like before a battle, the soldiers actively prepared everything for the upcoming cultural learning movement: pens, notebooks, dictionaries, and ink.
    On the afternoon of June 9th, all the soldiers of the battalion gathered neatly in the square, and the battalion commander solemnly issued a combat mobilization order. The order required the entire battalion to "annihilate 2,000 new characters with the spirit of Dong Cunrui blowing up the pillbox!" Facing the images of their leaders—Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu—the soldiers swore to quickly build a modern and strong national defense force: "Guarantee to complete the task 100%!"
    The soldiers silently remembered their oath and threw themselves into the "battle." The "battle" was fierce, which suited the soldiers' tastes very well. After eighteen hours of learning phonetic symbols and pinyin, they entered the stage of attacking new characters. Like carefully examining a pillbox, the soldiers carefully examined each new character; they pinned the new character list to the top of their mosquito nets, recited them before going to bed at noon, and recited them again when they opened their eyes after waking up; they cut the new characters into squares and put them in their pockets, testing others and themselves everywhere like children drawing lots; they used the method of passing a ball while drumming to conduct literacy competitions, they put phonetic symbols on the slogans in the classroom, dining hall, and auditorium, and even on the signs in the toilet, their slogan was "Learn wherever we go!"
    During the learning, no one wanted to fall behind. Each of them was determined to follow the whole battalion forward. Soldier Meng Quantou used to recognize few characters, but he still completed the tasks according to the daily requirements. The group leader knew that his level was low, so he often helped him. Each time the group leader asked him:
    "Meng Quantou, are there any difficulties?" He replied:
    "How could there be no difficulties? However, I, Meng Quantou, guarantee to you: wherever the group goes, I will follow!" However, after the attack on new characters entered the second stage, the strange characters became more and more numerous, and he felt very strenuous. This day he was on duty as a sentry, and when he got off duty at three o'clock in the night, the fatigue of the day pressed on him like a thousand-pound burden, and he couldn't wait to lie on the bed and sleep until dawn. But he suddenly remembered that he hadn't mastered the new characters he attacked during the day. If he fell behind tomorrow, and couldn't catch up the day after tomorrow, wouldn't he be falling behind on the new front? He gently took out his textbook from the dormitory and sat down on the corridor. More than three hundred new characters seemed to be sucking him in, he read them three and five times, always afraid of not being sure. When he felt that he was almost there, the wake-up call had already sounded. The platoon leader severely criticized him, and the group also criticized him, but the next day the group strengthened their help to him, and his determination became even greater. In this way, he never fell behind again.
    Youth League member Zhao Qitang was newly incorporated into the battalion, and his organizational relationship had not yet been transferred; if he was slightly distracted, he would fall behind by more than a hundred characters on the second day of the attack on new characters. The group leader talked to him: "The organizational relationship will not be lost, your task now is to study culture, you have to catch up!" The next day, Zhao Qitang not only completed the number of new characters he attacked that day as required, but also made up for the number of characters he had fallen behind. When introducing his learning experience to everyone, he said: "What can I say? The group leader is right, our task now is to study, I hate American imperialism, I know, the faster we learn, the less dare it will invade us."
    The spirit of collectivism was highly promoted in the learning, and learning mutual aid became the guarantee of learning culture. Soldiers created various specific mutual aid methods according to the specific circumstances of the group. Model mutual aid groups sprung up like mushrooms in each company. The Dong Shichen group of the Second Company completed the task of attacking seven hundred characters on the first day, becoming the banner of the entire battalion's advance; the Li Changrong group implemented teaching and learning within the group, guaranteeing that the entire group completed the task; the Zhao Anguo group of the Youth League members implemented unified action, unified work and rest, and focused review methods, also pulled two comrades with very low levels onto the team.
    After fifty-three days, the vast majority of soldiers in the entire battalion knew two thousand characters. When conducting a large amount of reading, the "People's Daily," "North China Liberation Army," "Comrade-in-Arms," and more than 300 books specially prepared for the soldiers were piled up in front of them. At first, looking at the paper full of black marks, they felt a little panicked and doubtful in their hearts; but when they followed the lines and read down, and found that they were all familiar characters, and truly believed that they could understand, the soldiers jumped up happily; laughter rolled in from all directions like a burst of spring water. With extensive reading, the soldiers' horizons broadened; the scope of their ideological activities expanded, and their interest in various things increased.

    战斗的学习
    朱世霖
    人民解放军战士过去为解放祖国而战斗时的那种英雄的品质，在今天为建设强大现代化国防军而开展的全军文化学习运动中，又显示了新的光辉。 “八一”前夕，我访问了空军某部的一个营。这个营经过短短时间的学习，已全部消除了文盲。现在，他们又进入长期的正规的文化学习中了。
    营的教导员为了使我了解得更清楚，他给我看了战士们最近文化学习作业的一部——五百多篇稿件和甲级班的作文。这是战士们在经过速成识字学习后，第一次用文字表达他们丰富、细致、纯真的感情。
    这里有长达八、九百字的文章；有写给人民领袖的信件；有富有音乐节奏的活泼的诗歌、快板；有记述战斗经历和回忆过去苦难生活的短文；也有今后要永远站在国防最前线的个人决心书。当我看了这些作品时，我为战士们表达自己思想感情的能力而惊讶；我被战士们那种高度热爱祖国、憎恶敌人的情感和勇猛前进、排除万难的精神所感动，更加感到他们可敬可爱！
    在胡维民的一首诗歌里，这样记载他们自己学习情况：
    钟声当当，大家三五成行，手提文具、课本，大步进入课堂。谁管那狂风暴雨，谁管那火热的太阳，一个个情绪高涨，人民战士的意志是铁是钢。困难虽然不少，只要毛主席一声号召，咱们就喊一声冲！全部消除文盲。
    这个营在解放战争时期，始终活跃在平原省焦作一带；保卫和扩展解放区。当祖国号召建设强大人民空军的时候，这个营参加了人民空军的建设工作。面对着新事物，他们更感到文化对他们的重要。
    学习前，速成识字法的创造者——祁建华同志给战士们作报告。祁建华那种充满信心的表情，那句句无可置疑的话，深深地打动了战士们的心。他们大声咕噜着：“这方法行！”；和战斗开始之前一样，战士们为着即将开展的文化学习运动积极地准备一切：钢笔、笔记本、字典、墨水。
    六月九日下午，全营战士整齐地集合在广场上，营长庄严地下达了战斗动员令。命令全营要“以董存瑞炸碉堡的精神全歼生字二千个！”战士们面对着自己的领袖——毛主席，朱总司令的像，为迅速地建立起现代化的强大国防军而宣誓：“保证百分之百完成任务！”
    战士们默记着自己的誓言，投入了战斗。 “战斗”是猛烈的，这非常适合战士的口味，经过十八小时的注音符号、拼音学习、进入了突击生字阶段。就像端详碉堡似地，战士们仔细地端详着每个生字；他们把生字表钉在蚊帐顶上，中午睡觉前念，睡醒后睁开眼又念；把生字剪成方块放在衣袋里，像小孩摸彩一样到处测验别人，测验自己；用击鼓传球的方法，进行识字比赛，他们把课堂、饭厅、礼堂的标语，甚至连厕所的牌牌上也注上了注音符号，他们的口号是“走到那儿，学到那儿！”
    学习中，没有一个人愿意掉队。他们个个下定决心要跟着全营一道前进。战士孟全头过去认字少，他一样按每天的要求完成任务。小组长知道他程度低，就时常帮助他。每次当小组长问他：
    “孟全头有困难没有？”他回答：
    “困难还能没有？不过，我孟全头向你保证：小组走到那，我就跟到哪！”可是，突击生字进入第二阶段后，古怪字越来越多了，他感到很吃力。这天是他值班放哨，夜里三点钟下了岗，一天的疲乏像千斤担子一样压着他，恨不得一下子躺到床上，睡他个大天亮。但他猛然想起白天突击的生字还没有把握，要是明天掉了队，后天再赶不上，这不就要在新的战线上掉队吗？他轻手轻脚地从宿舍拿出课本，一屁股坐在走廊上，三百多个生字就像吸住他一样，他三遍五遍地念，总怕没把握。当他感到差不多了的时候，起床号已经吹过了。排长严厉地批评了他，小组也批评他，但是第二天小组就加强了对他的帮助，他的决心就更大了。就这样，以后他没掉过一次队。
    青年团员赵启堂是新编入营的，组织关系还没转过来；稍不专心，突击生字的第二天就掉了一百多个字。小组长找他谈话：“组织关系不会丢的，现在你的任务是学习文化，你得追上去！”第二天，赵启堂不单按要求完成了当天突击生字数，而且补足了掉队的数。在向大家介绍学习经验的时候，他说：“我能说什么呢？组长说的对，我们现在的任务是学习，我恨美帝国主义，我知道，咱们学习得越快，它越不敢侵略我们。”
    学习中高度发扬了集体主义精神，学习互助组成了学习文化的保证。战士们依据小组的具体情况，创造了各种具体的互助方式。模范互助组像雨后春笋样出现在各个连队。二连董士臣小组第一天就全部完成了突击七百字的任务，成了全营前进的旗手；李常荣小组实行组内包教保学，保证了全组全部完成任务；青年团员赵安国小组实行统一行动，统一作息，重点复习的方法，把两个程度很低的同志也拉上了队。
    全营经过五十三天的时间，绝大部分战士都认识了二千字。在进行大量阅读的时候，“人民日报”
    “华北解放军”、“战友”，还有专为战士准备的三百多本书籍，一堆一堆的摆在他们面前。开始时，看着满纸黑麻麻地，心里还有些惊慌和疑惑；但当他们顺着一行一行念下去，发现全是熟字，而且又真相信自己能看懂了的时候，战士们高兴地跳起来了；笑声像迸发的泉水一样从四面滚来。随着广泛阅读，战士们的视野宽阔了；思想活动的范围扩大了，对各种事物的兴趣增大了。
