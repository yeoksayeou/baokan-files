The Northeast Trade Department Inspects Warehouse Work to Improve Management Methods

Not long ago, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government organized a large number of personnel to inspect warehouse work in various locations. They discovered that the warehouses of trade departments in various places were in extreme disarray, causing serious losses to state property. For example, the Fourth Warehouse of the Dalian Industrial Materials Company, managing over two thousand types of goods, had machinery, steel, and scrap iron piled together in the storage yard, exposed to the elements. Scattered steel stretched over a hundred meters onto the street. In the warehouse of the Harbin Industrial Materials Company, a crane chain broke, ruining nine out of ten tape recorders. Transformer insulation grew mold, and steel sheets rusted. In many warehouses, the movement of goods was unclear, and the phenomenon of stockpiling was even more serious. Taking the stockpiled goods of the Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station, Department Store Company, and Industrial Materials Company alone, the value was equivalent to 28% of the annual sales revenue. If this situation is not changed immediately, it will seriously affect the completion of the state's trade plan.

Why does such serious chaos exist in warehouse management? The main reason is that the leading cadres of many trade departments do not sufficiently recognize the importance of warehouse work. Warehouse storage is an indispensable part of the commodity circulation process, a vital link directly affecting commodity circulation, and the place where a large amount of state materials are stored. Therefore, it is necessary to equip it with strong cadres, establish a scientific statistical system, and carry out technical storage to reduce natural losses. At the same time, it is necessary to actively contact relevant departments, and to organically combine business, transportation, sales, and warehouse work to ensure the smooth circulation of goods.

However, some leading cadres of trade administrations and enterprises at all levels currently regard warehouse management as purely physical labor, believing that anyone with sufficient strength can do it. Some even mistakenly believe that having politically strong cadres doing storage work is "burying" talent. This has led to a tendency to simply use warehouse storage cadres without educating them. Among storage cadres, a simple task-oriented view has also developed. They lack enthusiasm, passively believing that warehouse storage work is just "watching the pile," and that it is enough to "not let it spoil, not let it be lost, and not let it catch fire." The above reasons have created the current chaotic situation in the warehouses of state-owned trade departments in various parts of Northeast China, causing large losses, waste, and stockpiling of goods, and affecting the turnover of funds.

In order to change the current chaotic situation in warehouses, the Northeast Trade Department has taken the following specific measures:

First, it has transferred some cadres and promoted a group of active and promising storekeepers to warehouse leadership positions. The personnel department is continuing to review, understand, adjust, and equip warehouse staff. At the same time, it is conducting education aimed at the passive thinking of the current storage staff who are afraid of taking responsibility, and carrying out patriotic emulation. The Party branches in the warehouses are also gradually strengthening their study and leadership, raising the awareness of employees, and giving play to the supervisory and guaranteeing role of the Party in warehouse enterprises.

Second, the Northeast Trade Department and the Shenyang Municipal Trade Department have established the Shenyang Area Warehouse Rectification Working Committee. After gaining experience, it will promote the rapid improvement of warehouse management throughout the region. The current work of the Warehouse Rectification Working Committee is to combine warehouse rectification with the promotion of goods sales, and to conduct a major inventory of warehouse goods. The method is to convene grassroots business personnel (mainly purchasing agents, salespersons, allocation clerks, storekeepers, etc.) from subordinate supply units (including cooperatives) to visit the warehouse and make requests for goods, so as to promptly allocate and distribute the goods to grassroots sales companies for sale. Grassroots business personnel from the southern region of the Northeast Department Store Company visited the Shenyang area wholesale station, and their initial request for goods reached 200 billion yuan. Secondly, in order to gradually professionalize warehouses in terms of equipment and staffing, and to give full play to the existing warehouse equipment capacity, special warehouses have been uniformly adjusted and divided according to location, capacity, transportation, equipment, and other conditions, combined with the types, quantities, and properties of goods. At the same time, the newly adjusted warehouses have implemented classified storage and a commodity card system for goods piles based on the principles of safety and convenience. The procedures for large-volume packaged goods have been simplified, with a one-time inventory system implemented. Storekeepers have also implemented a specialized responsibility system for managing certain types or dozens of types of goods from entry to exit. Since May, the Northeast Trade Department and various specialized companies have included the trial manufacturing of a commodity storage plan (the inventory plan is expressed in terms of quantity and amount, and the storage plan is expressed in terms of volume) as part of the entire plan, in order to grasp the required amount of commodity reserves. Currently, it is studying and formulating regulations such as the storage quota per unit area and the storage quota for the number of days goods are in storage.

Third, improving the warehouse management system requires close cooperation from all parties. Shenyang held a liaison meeting of storekeepers, appraisers, allocation clerks, accountants, purchasing agents, and transporters, inspected the warehouse on-site, and resolved problems on the spot. This has had a great effect on eliminating unpriced goods and discrepancies between goods and accounts. For example, Shenyang has established a system in which storekeepers, allocation clerks, and purchasing agents hold regular meetings every half month, as well as an accident reporting system. The work of compiling a unified commodity code and commodity circulation operating procedures for the entire Northeast region is currently underway. (Chen Xin)

    东北贸易部检查仓库工作改进管理方法
    东北人民政府贸易部不久前曾组织了大批人员分赴各地检查仓库工作，发现各地贸易部门的仓库异常混乱，造成国家资财的严重损失。例如，旅大市工业器材公司第四仓库，管理二千多种商品，货场的机器、钢材和破钢铁堆在一起，任其风吹雨淋，散乱钢铁，一直摆到大街上百公尺以外。哈尔滨市工业器材公司仓库的吊车链子断了，十个录音机打坏了九个，变压器绒包长了毛，钢片生了锈。很多仓库的商品来去不明，积压现象更为严重。单以沈阳市百货批发站、百货公司、工业器材公司三个单位积压的商品来说，即等于全年卖钱额的百分之二十八。这一状况如不立即改变，必将严重影响国家贸易计划的完成。
    为什么仓库管理工作会存在这样严重的混乱现象呢？主要是由于很多贸易部门的领导干部，对仓库工作的重要意义认识不足。仓库保管是商品流转过程中必不可少的工作，是直接影响商品流转的重要环节，是国家大量物资的储存之所。因此，必须要配备较强的干部，要建立科学的统计制度，进行技术保管，以减少自然损耗。同时必须和有关部门主动联系，要使业务、运输、推销与仓库工作有机地结合起来，才能保证商品的顺畅流转。
    但是，目前各级贸易行政和企业的某些领导干部，却把仓库管理工作看成是单纯的体力劳动，只要力气大就能做；有的甚至错误地认为政治上较强的干部做保管工作是“埋没”人材。因而产生对仓库保管工作干部单纯使用，不加教育的偏向。保管工作干部中也产生了单纯的任务观点，缺乏积极性，消极认为仓库保管工作是“看堆”，只要“不坏、不丢、不起火”就行。上述原因，就造成了目前东北各地国营贸易部门仓库的混乱现象，造成商品的大量损耗、浪费和积压，影响了资金的周转。
    东北贸易部为了改变目前仓库的混乱状况，采取了如下具体办法：
    第一、调派一部分干部和提拔了一批积极有为的保管员到仓库领导岗位上去，人事部门正继续审查、了解、调整、配备仓库工作人员。同时针对着目前保管工作人员中怕负责任的消极思想进行教育，开展爱国主义竞赛。仓库的党支部也逐步加强学习领导，提高职工的觉悟，发挥党在仓库企业中的监督、保证作用。
    第二、东北贸易部和沈阳市贸易部门成立了沈阳地区仓库整顿工作委员会，取得经验后，再推动全区仓库管理工作的迅速改进。仓库整顿工作委员会目前的工作首先是把整顿仓库和推销商品结合起来，进行一次仓库商品大清点。其办法是召开所属供应单位（包括合作社）基层业务人员（主要是采购员、营业员、调拨员、保管员等）参观仓库，进行要货，以便及时调拨，把商品分配到基层推销公司卖出去。东北区百货公司南部地区基层业务人员参观了沈阳地区批发站，一次要货即达二千亿元。其次为使仓库在设备上与人员配备上逐渐走向专业化，并发挥现有仓库设备能力，特按照地点、容量、交通、设备等条件，结合着商品种类、数量、性质，统一调整和划分了专门仓库。同时新调整的仓库依据安全、便利原则，实行了分类保管和货堆商品卡片制，大宗包装商品简化了手续，实行一次清点制，保管员也实行了专管某种或几十种商品，从进到出的专责制。东北贸易部和各专业公司从五月份起，把试制商品保管计划（库存计划是以数量与金额表现的，保管计划是以容积表现的），列入整个计划组成部分，以便掌握商品储备需要量。目前正在研究、制订单位面积保管定额、商品在库日期保管定额等制度。
    第三、改善仓库管理制度必须要有各方面的密切配合。沈阳市召开保管员、作价员、调拨员、会计员、采购员、运输员的联系会议，到仓库现场检查，当场解决问题，这对消灭无价商品、货账不相符，效果很大。如沈阳已订出保管员、调拨员、采购员每半月定期举行会议的制度、事故报告制度等，现正在编制全东北区商品统一编号和商品流转操作规程的工作。（陈新）
