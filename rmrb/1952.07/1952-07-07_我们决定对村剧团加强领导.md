    We Decide to Strengthen Leadership of the Village Theatre Troupe
    Comrade Editor: After seeing the records of the worker-peasant-soldier literary and art symposium published in the People's Daily, we convened a meeting of relevant departments in our village to discuss how to improve our literary and art work; and reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of past work, and drew up a plan for the future.
    In the past, our village also established a theatre troupe, but because the village leadership did not pay attention to this work, the troupe lacked dedicated leadership and was not integrated with the central work. They would just find a script and stage it randomly, and mobilized a lot of people, so it could not last and collapsed. After this discussion, everyone realized the importance of literary and art propaganda. We decided to first strengthen leadership, establish a permanent village theatre troupe, led by Wu Kuirong, the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch, Qi Zhaolan, a member of the branch committee, and Liu Guiying, the cultural and educational committee member. Whether performing plays or writing quick board rhymes, we must integrate with the central work so that literary and art activities can play a certain role in promoting the work. The performances should be short and concise, avoiding extravagance and waste. People who participate in the activities must be voluntary and confident in doing a good job in literary and art activities. We are now working with comrades from the village cultural station to write a short play "Sending Good News" to promote the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. We feel that there are too few literary and artistic works that promote central work, and it is difficult to find suitable ones for our performances. We hope that more such works can be provided.

    我们决定对村剧团加强领导
    编辑同志：我们看到人民日报发表的工农兵文艺座谈会记录以后，召集了我村有关文艺的部门举行会议，研究如何改进我们的文艺工作；并检查了过去工作中的优缺点，订出今后的计划。
    过去我村也成立过剧团，因为村的领导方面没有重视这一工作，剧团缺乏专人领导，也没有结合中心工作，找到一个剧本就乱排，并动员了很多人，所以不能持久，垮了。经过这次的讨论，大家都认识了文艺宣传的重要性。我们决定首先健全领导，成立长久性的村剧团，由我村团支部书记吴奎荣、支部委员祁兆兰、文教委员刘桂英负责领导。无论演剧、编快板等都要结合中心工作，使文艺活动能在工作中起一定的推动作用。演出的节目要短小精悍，避免铺张浪费。参加活动的人必须是自愿的，也是有信心搞好文艺活动的。现在我们正和村文化站的同志编一个短剧“送喜报”，宣传互助合作的好处。我们觉得配合中心工作宣传的文艺作品太少，很难找到适合我们演出用的，希望能多供给一些这样的作品。
