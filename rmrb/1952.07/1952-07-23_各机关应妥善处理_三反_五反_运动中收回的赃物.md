    All Agencies Should Properly Handle the Confiscated Goods Recovered During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements

    During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, all agencies recovered some stolen goods from embezzlers. Some agencies have not yet processed these stolen goods, nor have they properly stored them, resulting in some losses. Among the stolen goods recovered by our agency, some wooden items have become damp and moldy, some bicycle tires are broken, the frames are rusty, and some leather goods have become infested with insects. Therefore, I suggest that all agencies pay attention to the handling and storage of these items. Shi Ying

    各机关应妥善处理“三反”“五反”运动中收回的赃物
    在“三反”“五反”运动中，各机关都收回了一些贪污分子贪污的赃物。有些机关还没有处理这些赃物，也没有很好的保管，造成了一些损失。我们机关收回的赃物中，有些木器已经潮湿霉烂了，有的自行车的车胎破烂，架子生锈了，有些皮货也生了虫。因此，我建议各机关注意处理、保管这些东西。史瑛
