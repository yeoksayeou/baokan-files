    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The China Peace Committee and the Beijing branch jointly held a welcome rally on the afternoon of the 26th to welcome the victorious return of our delegation, led by Guo Moruo, attending the World Peace Council Special Session and Tu Changwang, our representative attending the World Federation of Scientific Workers Executive Committee Meeting. Representatives from people's organizations and various agencies in the capital, totaling 1,300 people, attended the meeting. At the beginning of the rally, Zhang Xiruo, Standing Committee Member of the China Peace Committee and Chairman of the Beijing branch, delivered a welcome speech, extending a warm welcome to all the representatives. Then, amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience, Guo Moruo delivered a report entitled "Mobilize the People of the World to Make the Spirit of Negotiation Triumph over Military Solutions," discussing the achievements of the World Peace Council Special Session (the full text of the report will be issued separately). Finally, Tu Changwang reported on the proceedings of the World Federation of Scientific Workers Executive Committee meeting held in Vienna this May. He pointed out that the main issues discussed at this meeting were the United States' bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people and the future direction of the World Federation of Scientific Workers' struggle. The meeting had already passed a resolution instructing the association's president, Joliot-Curie, to issue a notice to branches in all countries, calling on scientists from all countries to oppose bacteriological warfare and force the United States to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Scientists from various countries participating in the meeting felt that they had a moral responsibility and demanded to defend peace because they saw that scientific achievements had been stolen by warmongers. The meeting has determined the specific methods for convening a world peace conference of scientists.

    【新华社二十六日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会及北京市分会在二十六日下午联合举行欢迎大会，欢迎由郭沫若率领的我国出席世界和平理事会特别会议代表团和出席世界科学工作者协会执行委员会会议的我国代表涂长望胜利回国。到会的有首都各人民团体、各机关的代表一千三百人。大会开始时，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员、北京市分会主席张奚若致欢迎词，他向全体代表们表示了热诚欢迎。接着，郭沫若在全场热烈掌声中作了题为“动员世界人民使协商精神战胜武力解决”的报告，论述世界和平理事会特别会议的成就（报告全文另发）。最后由涂长望报告世界科学工作者协会执行委员会今年五月维也纳会议的经过。他指出：这次会议主要是讨论美国向中国与朝鲜人民进行细菌战和世界科协今后斗争方向两个问题。会议已通过决议，责成协会主席约里奥—居里向各国分会发出通告，号召各国科学家反对细菌战，迫使美国批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书。参加会议的各国科学家由于看到科学成果已被战争贩子盗用，因此感觉自己负有道义责任，而要求保卫和平。会议已确定了召开科学家世界和平会议的具体方法。
