The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been fully inspected and accepted, and all aspects of the project meet the required standards. The acceptance team dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, headed by Vice Minister Zhang Hanying, and the acceptance team headed by Liu Fei, Minister of the Water Resources Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, began acceptance on June 28th, and after ten days, completed the acceptance of the entire project. The central acceptance personnel and the central-south acceptance team believe that all aspects of the project meet the standards and are approved for acceptance. The acceptance team also believes that completing such a huge project in such a short period of time is an unprecedented achievement.

The projects accepted this time include: the Jingjiang Dam reinforcement project, the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate project, the Huangshantou Control Gate project (including the Hudu River Dam project), the flood diversion area dikes (including the Anxiang Hebei Dike, the Huangtianhu West Dike, and the Hudu River West Dike), as well as the construction of dikes and the demolition of transverse dikes in the five safety zones within the flood diversion area. The central acceptance personnel and the central-south acceptance team successively visited each construction site for detailed verification and inspection based on the project plans and as-built drawings. The result of the acceptance is that the above projects have all been completed ahead of schedule according to the plan. Among them, the amount of reinforced concrete and earthwork has been increased due to actual needs, exceeding the original plan. The quality of the project meets the standards. The reasons for achieving such outstanding achievements are that the project headquarters promptly put forward the three major requirements of "good, fast, and economical" and the slogan of "seeking 'fast' and 'economical' on the principle of 'good'," and constantly checked the quality of the project. Before completion, the leading organs of each project also conducted a general quality inspection, and timely remedied certain defects in the project.

Regarding the Jingjiang Dam reinforcement project: all of the more than 1,470 houses on the Shashi to Hao Xue embankment section have been relocated, and the embankment foundation, cinders, and loose soil in Shashi City have been renovated and rebuilt, thereby greatly strengthening the embankment. The dangerous embankment sections such as Guanyinsi, Qijiayuan, and Chongheguan are much safer after this revetment. Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, believes that "after this reinforcement, the Jingjiang Dam is more stable than before."

Regarding the flood diversion project: The huge modern building built on the sand layer, the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate, was built according to advanced Soviet experience and has seepage prevention and scouring prevention equipment. Its safety factor is more than twice as large as the original design. The Huangshantou Control Gate is extremely solid because it is built on the clay layer at the foot of the mountain. Central acceptance project personnel and the central-south acceptance team both believe that building a sluice gate on this type of soil is very ideal. The Hudu River Dam next to the control gate and the Huangtianhu New Dike in the flood diversion area dike are the two major difficult projects in the entire earthwork project. Among them, the Hudu River Dam project was built in a river five meters deep; the Huangtianhu New Dike was built by removing more than 60,000 cubic meters of silt and transporting clay from a distance of two to three thousand meters. The height, cross-section, and slope of these two projects are generally well done.

The central acceptance personnel and the central-south acceptance team also discovered local embankment settlement in the Hudu River Dam. This is because there was a lot of rain and the soil was wet during construction, and the time was tight, so the soil layer could not be solidified in a short period of time. Now, the project headquarters is adding earthwork to remedy the situation.

### 荆江分洪工程验收完毕各项工程合乎标准

    荆江分洪工程验收完毕各项工程合乎标准
    荆江分洪工程已验收完毕，各项工程都合乎标准。中央人民政府水利部派出的以副部长张含英为首的验收工作人员，和中南军政委员会水利部部长刘斐为首的验收团，自六月二十八日开始验收，前后历时十天，将全部工程验收完毕。中央验收工作人员和中南验收团认为：各项工程都合乎标准，准予验收。验收团并认为：在这样短时间完成这样巨大的工程，实在是空前的成就。
    这次验收的工程包括：荆江大堤加固工程、太平口进洪闸工程、黄山头节制闸工程（包括虎渡河拦河坝工程）、分洪区围堤（包括安乡河北堤、黄天湖西堤和虎渡河西堤）以及分洪区内五个安全区的堤防的兴修和刨毁横堤工程。中央验收工作人员和中南验收团先后根据各项工程计划和竣工图表亲赴各工地作了详细的核对、检验。验收结果：上述各项工程都按计划提前完成了，其中钢筋混凝土和土方工程，并因实际需要增加了方数，超过了原订的计划。工程质量是合乎标准的。获得这样卓越成就的原因是工程指挥部曾及时提出“好、快、省”三大要求和“在‘好’的原则下求‘快’求‘省’”的口号，又曾不断检查工程质量；完工前夕，各工程领导机关又普遍进行了一次质量大检查，并曾对某些工程上的缺陷及时作了补救。
    关于荆江大堤的加固工程：沙市到郝穴堤段上的一千四百七十余栋房屋已全部迁移，沙市市内堤底屋基，炭渣和松土翻新修筑后，堤防因而大为加强。在观音寺、祁家渊、冲和观等险工堤段，这次抛护岸石后较前安全多了。中央人民政府水利部副部长张含英认为：“荆江大堤经过这次加固之后，堤身较前更为稳定。”
    关于分洪工程：建筑在沙积层上的巨大的现代化建筑物——太平口进洪闸，是按苏联先进经验修建的，有防渗和防冲的设备，它的安全系数较原设计大过一倍。黄山头节制闸因为建筑在山脚下的粘土层上，基础极为牢实。中央验收工程人员和中南验收团都认为：在这种土质上建筑水闸是非常合乎理想的。节制闸旁的虎渡河拦河坝和分洪区围堤中的黄天湖新堤是整个土方工程中的两大难工。其中虎渡河拦河坝工程是在五公尺深的河中修筑的；黄天湖新堤是清除了六万多方淤泥，再从两、三千公尺距离外运来粘土筑成的。这两项工程的高度、断面和坡度一般都做得很好。
    中央验收工作人员和中南验收团也发现虎渡河拦河坝有局部堤段沉降现象。这是因为施工期间雨多土湿，时间紧迫，土层不能在短时期坚实下落。现在，工程指挥部正增培土方，加以补救。
