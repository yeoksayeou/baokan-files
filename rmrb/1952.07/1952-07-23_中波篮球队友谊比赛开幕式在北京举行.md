    Wei Que's Welcome Speech

    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    Today marks the official opening of our basketball friendship match with the Polish basketball delegation. Today is also the National Day of the Polish Republic. Let us first extend our warm congratulations, and at the same time, with the most excited and joyous hearts, welcome our dear friends who have come from afar – the Polish basketball delegation led by Comrade Kozusznik Bohuslav – and extend our sincere fraternal greetings!
    The Polish basketball delegation's visit to our country to participate in friendly matches with basketball teams from all over China will allow for the exchange of experiences in sports work between China and Poland. This is of great significance in strengthening the friendship between the peoples of China and Poland.
    Under the care and leadership of their governments, the people of China and Poland have actively carried out national sports activities, learning from the advanced experiences of socialist Soviet sports, enabling the sports movements in our two countries to determine new directions and further development. At the same time, the relationship between the sports movements of the Chinese and Polish people has become even closer.
    In 1951, our student basketball team visited Poland. This time, the Polish basketball delegation is visiting our country again, which is a great encouragement to the sports undertakings of the people of China and Poland. Sports workers and athletes across the country, let us work harder to welcome our Polish friends and learn from the experience of Polish sports workers, especially the basketball delegation. We sincerely hope to further strengthen ties with sports workers and athletes in Poland and other people's democratic countries in the future; to develop and consolidate our great friendship and the struggle to defend world peace, and to widely exchange our sports movements.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the people, sports workers, and athletes of China and Poland!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Polish Republic!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live President Beirut, the leader of the Polish people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world!

    Reply speech by Kozusznik Bohuslav, Head of the Polish Basketball Delegation
    Dear comrades, dear friends!
    I bring you warm congratulations from the vast numbers of Polish athletes. The ranks of Polish athletes are growing day by day. Today, the Polish people are warmly celebrating the eighth anniversary of Polish National Day and the establishment of the Constitution of the Polish Republic. Before the war, the working people of Poland could not enjoy the benefits of sports; they could not enter sports fields and swimming pools. Only after the armies of the Soviet Union and Poland fought side by side to liberate our country, only after the establishment of the People's Poland, has sports developed in the People's Poland as never before. The hallmark of sports in People's Poland is its universality. The Polish sports movement is growing day by day, taking the Soviet Union as an example.
    The turning point in the development of Polish sports was the resolution of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in September 1949 on sports. The resolution stated: "One of the most important factors in laying the socialist foundation of People's Poland is the education of new people to participate in the creation of a new and just regime."
    In this educational work, sports occupies an important place. Sports strengthens the people's strength, improves work efficiency, and consolidates national defense. Sports has become a major part of the social activities and education of young people. Therefore, sports has become an important issue and is under the special protection of our Party.
    In our country, sports is one of the important factors in cultivating new people, and it is also an important tool in the struggle for socialist construction.
    The new Constitution of the Polish Republic further guarantees the people's right to sports. Article 59 of the Constitution guarantees the development of sports organizations.
    The sports fields of People's Poland are increasing day by day. In 1950, 1,000 volleyball and basketball courts were built in various villages. In 1951, another 100 well-equipped sports fields were built. In our heroic capital, Warsaw, we have begun to build a central sports field and many swimming pools. The number of tennis courts has increased from 600 before the war to 1,500.
    Now, sports associations have 3,000 football fields, 390 swimming pools, 540 gymnasiums, 37 sports halls, and 17 large sports halls.
    The national race in 1948 was attended by 300,000 people, and in 1951 by 700,000 people, while before the war in 1938 there were only 30,000 people. The annual autumn competition was attended by 529,000 people in 1948 and 1.5 million people in 1950. These figures show the rapid development of sports in our country. The sports of the Polish people has made significant achievements.
    Polish athlete Rakoczy won the world gymnastics championship in Basel. The Polish women's volleyball team won the runner-up in the European competition in Sofia, the Soviet Union being the champion. The Polish women's basketball team here won fifth place in the World Championships in Moscow this year.
    Polish athletes maintain regular contact with foreign athletes in order to strengthen the fraternal friendship between themselves and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.
    When we received your invitation to hold competitions with your men's and women's basketball teams, although we were also going to participate in the International Olympic Games, we accepted your invitation without hesitation and came here today.
    We also maintain contact with progressive athletes in capitalist countries who are striving for progress and peace.
    Our sport is closely linked to the struggle for peace. For example, the bicycle race organized by the Polish United Workers' Party newspaper "People's Tribune" and the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee newspaper "Red Right." Athletes from various people's democratic countries and workers' representatives from capitalist countries participated in this competition, called the "Peace Race," which is an annual expression of the great international unity of athletes striving for peace. Polish athletes actively participate in the struggle for peace. They, together with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and millions of good people around the world, are united to fight for peace. Our main slogan is to use sports to strive for peace, the victory of socialism, and to make the forces of democracy defeat evil and war, in order to crush the war-mongers' plans to instigate a new war.
    Therefore, our athletes, together with the people of the whole country, the people of all Korea, and your volunteer soldiers, are fighting against the aggression of US imperialism.
    We are here to strengthen the eternal friendship and cooperation between the Polish people and the great Chinese people. We have a common goal of struggle – for peace, democracy, socialism, for the future happiness of all working people, for the liberation of all mankind from slavery, oppression, and a society of man exploiting man. In this struggle, we will surely win, because we are under the guidance of the great Soviet Union and Stalin, because we are fighting under the leadership of Beirut, the faithful student of Lenin and Stalin, and you under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Long live the lasting friendship between the athletes of the great People's China and People's Poland!
    Long live the consolidation and strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples!
    Long live Comrade Beirut, Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live the great Stalin!

    中波两国人民在自己政府的关怀和领导下，积极地开展了国民体育运动，学习社会主义苏联体育的先进经验，使我们两国的体育运动，确定了新的方向和进一步的发展，同时中波两国人民的体育运动的关系也更加密切起来。
    一九五一年我们学生篮球队曾访问了波兰。这次波兰篮球代表队又来访问我国，这对中波两国人民的体育事业有着很大的鼓舞作用。全国的体育工作者和运动员们，让我们更加努力工作，欢迎我们的波兰朋友，学习波兰体育工作者，特别是篮球代表队的经验。我们诚恳地希望与波兰和各人民民主国家的体育工作者和运动员们今后更进一步地加强联系；为了发展和巩固我们之间的伟大友谊和保卫世界和平的斗争，并把我们的体育运动广泛地交流起来。

    波兰共和国万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    波兰人民领袖贝鲁特总统万岁！
    全世界劳动人民领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！波兰篮球代表队总领队
    科佐施尼克·波古斯拉夫答词亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    我给你们带来了广大的波兰运动员们的热烈祝贺。波兰的运动员队伍正在一天天壮大。今天，波兰人民在热烈庆祝波兰国庆日第八周年与波兰共和国宪法成立。战前，工农大众不能够享受运动的利益，他们不能进入运动场和游泳池。只有在苏联和波兰的军队并肩作战解放了我国以后，只有在人民的波兰成立以后，体育才在人民的波兰空前地发展起来。人民波兰体育的特点是普及。波兰体育运动是以苏联为榜样而一天天地成长起来的。
    波兰体育发展的转折点是波兰统一工人党中央委员会一九四九年九月关于体育的决议。决议说：“奠定人民波兰社会主义基础的最重要因素之一是教育新人以参加新的、公正的政权的创立。”
    在这一项教育工作中，体育占重要的地位。体育壮大了人民的力量，提高了工作效率，巩固了国防。体育成了青年的社会活动和教育的主要内容。所以体育变成一个重要的问题而受到我们党的特别保护。
    在我们国内，体育是培养新人的重要因素之一，同时也是社会主义建设斗争中的一个重要工具。
    波兰共和国的新宪法更保障人民享有体育的权利。宪法第五十九条保证体育组织的发展。
    人民波兰的运动场正一天天增多。一九五○年时，各乡村建筑了排球和篮球场一千个。一九五一年时，又建筑了一百个设备完善的运动场。在我们英雄的首都华沙，我们已开始建筑一个中央运动场和许多游泳池。网球场已由战前的六百个增加为一千五百个。
    现在体育协会有三千个足球场，三百九十个游泳池，五百四十个体育馆，三十七个运动馆和十七个大型运动馆。
    一九四八年的全国赛跑有三十万人参加，一九五一年有七十万人，而战前一九三八年时只有三万人。一年一次的秋季竞赛，一九四八年有五十二万九千人参加，一九五○年有一百五十万人参加。这些数字表现出我们国家体育迅速发展的情形。波兰人民的体育是有重大成绩的。
    波兰选手拉考次在巴基里亚地方得到世界技巧冠军。波兰妇女排球队在索非亚的欧洲比赛中获得亚军，苏联是冠军。在这里的波兰女子篮球队在今年莫斯科的世界比赛中获得第五名。
    波兰的运动员和外国的运动员经常保持着联系，为的是加强和苏联、各人民民主国家之间的兄弟般的友谊。
    当我们接到你们的邀请来和你们的男女篮球队举行比赛时，虽然我们也要参加国际奥林匹克的运动会，但是我们毫不犹疑的，仍接受了你们的邀请，而在今天来到这里。
    我们也和争取进步与和平的资本主义国家中的进步运动员保持联系。
    我们的体育是和争取和平的斗争密切联系在一起的。例如波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛”报和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央机关报“红色权利”报所组织的自行车竞赛。参加这一比赛的有各人民民主国家的选手和资本主义国家的工人代表，这一比赛叫做“和平竞赛”，这是一年一度的表示争取和平的运动员们的伟大国际团结。波兰的运动员们积极参加了争取和平的斗争。他们和苏联、各人民民主国家以及世界上千百万善良人们共同联合起来为和平而斗争。我们的主要口号是以体育争取和平、社会主义的胜利，使民主的力量战胜罪恶和战争，以便粉碎战争贩子们阴谋挑动新战争的计划。
    所以我们的运动员们是和全国人民、全朝鲜人民、和你们的志愿军战士共同为反对美帝国主义的侵略而斗争的。
    我们来到这里是为了加强波兰人民和伟大中国人民之间的永久友谊与合作。我们有着共同奋斗的目标——为和平、民主、社会主义，为全体劳动人民将来的幸福，为全世界人类由奴役、压迫和人剥削人的社会中解放出来。在这一个斗争中，我们一定会取得胜利，因为我们是在伟大的苏联和斯大林指导之下，因为我们是在列宁和斯大林的忠实学生贝鲁特和你们在毛泽东同志的领导下而斗争着。
    伟大的人民中国和人民波兰运动员之间的持久友谊万岁！
    中波两国人民友谊的巩固和加强万岁！
    贝鲁特同志，毛泽东同志万岁！
    伟大的斯大林万岁！
