    The North China Economic Conference convened by the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council was held in Beijing on July 2nd. The conference decided to implement the seven policies explained by Director Chen Yun at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. It demanded that cadres throughout the region firmly stand their ground and unite with capitalists to actively manage industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in order to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and prepare for the peak season. Secondly, it was decided to launch a campaign to promote the sales of industrial products: responsible persons of state-owned trading departments must take personal responsibility, rely on employees, and implement the policy of focusing on wholesale as per the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government on June 12th, and actively promote the sales of industrial products to the countryside. Thirdly, it is necessary to actively expand processing and ordering: the standards for yarn and cloth processing and ordering shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. In accordance with the spirit of Director Chen Yun's speech at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the conference established standards for flour processing and ordering labor fees; the profit and specifications for processing and ordering of other commodities shall be negotiated and determined separately by the commercial departments of the provincial and municipal people's governments in conjunction with relevant parties. The industry and commerce bureaus of large and medium-sized city people's governments may lead relevant parties to organize processing and ordering review committees to handle problems that may arise during acceptance inspections. Economic departments in all regions must publicly disclose costs to the local people's government's financial and economic committees before mid-August, and cooperatives must also disclose costs to their members. State-owned trade should purchase public factories and mines' products according to plan, and can also purchase marketable products from private factories and mines. The state can also purchase a portion of accumulated industrial products.
    The conference decided that state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in the region should launch a patriotic production increase and economy campaign in the second half of this year, requiring the region's trading departments to save 520 billion yuan in circulation costs. All departments should quickly prepare for the launch of this campaign, especially mobilizing all employees to thoroughly expose and criticize capitalist management ideology and methods.
