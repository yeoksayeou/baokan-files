The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 149, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial titled "Contact with the Masses is the Guarantee of the Inevitable Victory of the Communist and Workers' Parties," which states: History presents the revolutionary Marxist working-class parties with a most important task – to lead the masses in struggle against the imperialists who provoke new wars, to safeguard and consolidate peace, to fight for democracy, and to fight for socialism. The Communist and Workers' Parties, which are fighting and working in all countries - whether in capitalist countries or in countries where the Communist and Workers' Parties have seized power - although their working environment and tasks are fundamentally different, have one thing in common: they were born from the people's masses and nurtured and cultivated by the people's masses; as long as they can contact the masses and contact the people, they are invincible. The editorial continues: The unity of the working class is a factor in consolidating national unity. The close and unbreakable connection between the Party and the entire working class is the guarantee of the Party's vitality and victorious development. Comrade Stalin teaches us: "The Party is the vanguard of the working class and the embodiment of the connection between the working class and the millions of masses. No matter how sound the vanguard is, no matter how well it is organized, if it does not connect with the non-Party masses, and does not expand and strengthen this connection, then the Party cannot survive and cannot develop." The editorial emphasizes: The experience of the glorious Soviet Communist Party is of inestimable importance to the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The Bolshevik Party never confined itself to a narrow circle; it united with the masses, crushed all enemies, and achieved victories of world-historical significance. The editorial points out: Under the current circumstances, the most important work for the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is to improve the initiative and organization of party branches, party groups, party leaders, and all party members, so as to explain the party's policies to the masses and link the party with the masses. The Communist Parties of capitalist countries should especially fight for the unity of the working class and all working people, and for the unity of all progressive, patriotic and democratic forces. The editorial concludes: Every Communist must deeply recognize his great responsibility as an agitator, propagandist, and organizer among the masses. In order to turn the possibility of thwarting the plans of the warmongers into a reality, this requires first and foremost that Communists, as peace fighters at the forefront of the masses, contribute a high degree of initiative and the greatest effort.

This issue publishes the report of Vulko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, at the Third Congress of the Fatherland Front on May 28: "The Fatherland Front and its Future Tasks." Chervenkov said: On September 9, 1944, the rule of the big capitalists and bourgeoisie was overthrown by the people's armed uprising led by the Bulgarian Communist Party. The working class and the working peasants formed an alliance, relying on the support of the powerful political army united under the banner of the Fatherland Front in the anti-fascist struggle, seized power, and formed a government with the participation of the working class's allies. In the three years after the uprising, the people's regime basically completed the task of establishing a democratic system and opposing imperialism. The working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, play a leading role in the Fatherland Front; they are the decisive force in the Fatherland Front and among the people. In the elections to the National Assembly, the Fatherland Front received 70 percent of the vote - the Communist Party alone received more than half of the total vote. Therefore, the leading position of the Communist Party has been recognized and determined by parliamentary elections. On December 23, 1947, we nationalized capitalist enterprises and banks. Since then, our people's democratic system - a special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat - has been formed and consolidated. The nationalization of capitalist enterprises and banks marked the end of the first stage of the development process of the people's democratic system and paved the way for the second stage - the stage of laying the socialist foundation. Chervenkov continued: After clearing out waverers and hostile elements, the Fatherland Front strengthened its internal unity, consolidated its ranks, and entered the second stage of the development process of the people's democratic system with vigor. Comrade Dimitrov pointed out the new tasks of this new stage at the Second Congress of the Fatherland Front. The Fatherland Front was reorganized into a unified socio-political organization with a revised program that put forward new tasks for socialist construction. The past four years have fully confirmed the correctness of this reorganization. In these years, the combat program for laying the socialist foundation, formulated by the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party and embodied in the first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan, has been realized under the vigorous and unremitting efforts of the people. Chervenkov concluded: Today, we are completing the work of laying the foundation for a socialist society and turning to the work of building a socialist edifice. The leadership of the Communist Party has been universally recognized by all members of the Fatherland Front and the people of the whole country, and there is no reason for the Fatherland Front to put forward its own separate program. The Fatherland Front is a vast social fortress of the people's regime and its local organs, and a mass school where everyone can enter to learn how to manage the country. In the future, if it can become a more mass-based organization, and if it more closely links its entire work with the work of the people's congresses in various places, it will certainly be able to successfully play a powerful and useful lever role in the people's democratic system.

This issue publishes an article by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain: "Oppose a Separate Treaty with Bonn Revanchists, Oppose Remilitarization, Strive for Peace," Pollitt pointed out: The fundamental task currently facing every British Communist and every party organization is to explain the criminal nature of the separate treaty to the working people, to achieve broad unity, and to demand that members of parliament oppose parliamentary ratification of the "general treaty." Pollitt said: The entire future of Britain depends on the awakening of the people and the people's active struggle for peace. This issue also publishes an article by Pietro Secchia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party: "The Italian People Vote Against the Policy of War."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四九期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四九期已经出版。
    本期发表的题为“联系群众是共产党和工人党必然胜利的保证”的社论说：历史在革命的马克思主义的工人阶级政党面前，提出了一个最伟大的任务——领导群众进行斗争，反对挑拨新战争的帝国主义者，维护和巩固和平，争取民主，争取社会主义。正在各国——无论是在资本主义国家或是在共产党和工人党已经掌握政权的国家——进行战斗和工作的共产党和工人党，尽管它们的工作环境和任务有根本的不同，但它们有一件事是共同的：它们是从人民群众中诞生、并为人民群众所抚育和培养出来的；只要它们能够联系群众，能够联系人民，它们就是不可战胜的。社论接着说：工人阶级的团结是巩固国家团结的因素。党与整个工人阶级的密切的、牢不可破的联系，是党的活力和获得胜利发展的保证。斯大林同志教导我们：“党是工人阶级的先锋队和工人阶级千百万群众的联系的体现。不论党是多么健全的先锋队，也不论它组织得多么好，但如果它不与非党群众联系，不扩大和加强这种联系，那么，党是不能生存、不能发展的。”社论强调：光荣的苏联共产党的经验，对于各国共产党和工人党有着无可估量的重大意义。布尔什维克党从来不把自己局限在狭隘的小圈子内，它和群众团结在一起，粉碎所有的敌人并取得了有世界历史意义的胜利。社论指出：在目前情况之下，各国共产党和工人党头等重要的工作就是：提高党支部、党小组、党的领导干部和所有党员的积极性和组织性；以便于向群众解释党的政策，把党和群众联结起来。资本主义各国的共产党，就应特别为团结工人阶级和所有劳动人民而斗争；为团结一切进步的、爱国的和民主的力量而斗争。社论最后说：每
    一个共产党人必须深深认识自己在群众中做一个鼓动者、宣传者和组织者的伟大责任。为了把挫败战争贩子计划的可能性变为现实性，这首先就要求作为群众前列的和平战士的共产党人，贡献出高度的积极性和最大的努力。
    本期刊载了保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记契尔文科夫五月二十八日在祖国阵线第三届代表大会上的报告：“祖国阵线及今后的任务”。契尔文科夫说：一九四四年九月九日，大资本家及资产阶级的统治被保加利亚共产党所领导的人民武装起义推翻了。工人阶级与劳动农民结成联盟，依靠着在祖国阵线的旗帜下、在反法西斯主义斗争中团结起来的强大的政治大军的支持，取得了政权，并组成了有工人阶级的盟友参加的政府。在起义后的三年中，人民政权基本上完成了建立民主制度和反帝国主义的任务。工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党，在祖国阵线中起着领导的作用，它们是祖国阵线中和人民中的决定性的力量。在国民议会的选举中，祖国阵线得到了百分之七十的票数——单单共产党就得到了总票数的一半以上。因此，共产党的领导地位已经被公认了，而且以议会选举的方式确定了。一九四七年十二月二十三日，我们将资本主义企业与银行收归国有。至此，我们人民民主制度——无产阶级专政的特殊形式——就形成并巩固了。资本主义企业和银行的收归国有标志着人民民主制度发展过程的第一阶段的结束，并为第二阶段——奠定社会主义基础的阶段铺平了道路。契尔文科夫接着说：祖国阵线在清除了动摇分子和敌对分子以后，加强了内部团结，巩固了队伍，精神奋发地进入了人民民主制度发展过程的第二阶段。季米特洛夫同志在祖国阵线的第二届代表大会上指出了这个新阶段的新任务。祖国阵线进行改组，成为统一的社会政治组织，有了经过修正的纲领，这个纲领提出了社会主义建设的新任务。过去的四年充分证实了这次改组的正确性。在这几年中，共产党第五届代表大会所制订的、体现在第一个季米特洛夫五年计划中的奠定社会主义基础的战斗纲领，已经在人民的生气蓬勃的、坚持不懈的努力下实现了。契尔文科夫最后说：今天，我们正在完成为社会主义社会奠定基础的工作，并转入建筑社会主义大厦的工作。祖国阵线的全体成员和全国人民已经普遍承认共产党的领导地位，祖国阵线就再无理由提出它自己的单独纲领了。祖国阵线是人民政权及其地方机构的广大的社会堡垒，是一个人人都可以进入的学习管理国家的大众学校。将来，如果它能成为更富于群众性的组织，如果它把整个工作与各地人民会议的工作更密切地联系起来，它一定能够在人民民主制度中成功地发挥有力的和有用的杠杆作用。
    本期刊载英国共产党总书记波立特的文章：“反对与波恩报复主义者缔结单独条约，反对重新军国主义化，争取和平”，波立特指出：每个英国共产党员和每个党组织当前的根本任务是向劳动人民解释单独条约的罪恶性质，取得广泛的团结，要求议员反对议会批准“一般性条约”。波立特说：英国的整个前途都决定于人民的觉醒以及人民积极地争取和平的斗争。本期还刊载了意大利共产党副总书记谢嘉的文章：“意大利人民投票反对战争政策。”
