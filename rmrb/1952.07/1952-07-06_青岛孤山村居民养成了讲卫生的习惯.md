    Residents of Gushan Village, Qingdao, Have Developed Good Hygiene Habits
    Sun Jianhua
    Walking into Gushan Village in Qingdao's Cangkou District now gives a very refreshing feeling. It is difficult to find even a speck of coal cinder or garbage on the streets. The garbage ditch on the south side has been repaired into a neat slope, and even the stinking ditch that no one used to care for has been cleaned up. Every day at noon or in the evening, the few locust trees by the ditch have become a natural park for people to rest, cool off, and read newspapers. Walking into any household, you can see that the courtyard is very tidy. Chickens and ducks are raised in newly built pens paved with lime soil; pigs climb on freshly laid yellow earth. Strings of sweet potatoes, dates, and salted fish hang under the eaves, and pots of sweet sauce in the yard are covered with clean gauze. Rice pots are scrubbed until they shine, and rice bowls are placed in bowl baskets covered with gauze or cloth. Every family can readily find fly swatters. Most of the walls in the houses have been brushed and washed, and quilts and bedding have also been taken apart and washed. Bedbugs and fleas are rarely seen. A layer of snow-white lime is sprinkled under the walls of the houses, and rat traps can be seen everywhere. Children take baths every two or three days, and mothers often wash their clothes. In addition to regularly washing and changing clothes, adults often go to the seaside or to the bathhouses in workers' dormitories to take baths at noon. Housewives regularly take warm water baths in the evenings. Seven wells for drinking water have been improved, and toilets near the wells have also been moved.
    This new atmosphere in Gushan Village has gradually emerged since the launch of the patriotic hygiene movement. Now, the good hygiene habits of the villagers have gradually developed. They have a catchphrase: "Cleanliness is proper; 'sloppiness' doesn't look like a family. If it's not clean, it's easy to get sick after eating." Now, lice are rarely found on children's heads, and bathing has become a habit. Zhang Xiulan once said: "Now that life is better, if I don't take a bath, I feel itchy all over and can't sleep." Cui Shuzhen also said: "If the children's clothes or bodies are dirty for a moment, I feel like I have something on my mind; only when I clean up the children when I have time does the stone in my heart fall." Guo Xiulan's mother used to watch mice running back and forth without even paying attention; now, as soon as she hears the sound of mice at night, she has to get up and try to catch them. Sometimes she can't sleep all night trying to catch a mouse. Zhang Xiuyun said: "Now, if there is anything unclean in the house, I have to sweep it up right away. Every day I open my eyes, I feel uncomfortable if I don't sweep the floor and wipe the table." In the past, people rarely paid attention to cleanliness when buying things on the street; now, if someone's stall is not hygienic and doesn't have a gauze cover, they can forget about doing business. Children, due to their mothers' teachings, have also developed good hygiene habits and no longer drink cold water. Everyone pays attention to environmental hygiene, and dirty soil and sewage are consciously poured into designated places.
    In the past, people in this village often got sick every summer. This year, because of attention to environmental and personal hygiene, and the injection of preventative medicine, the diseases have been basically eradicated. Many residents unanimously reflected: "This time, I really recognize the benefits of the government's leadership in carrying out the hygiene movement. There are fewer sick people this year than in previous years." Gao Tengshi said: "In previous years, the children's heads were bitten by lice and grew small sores; this year, there are no lice on the children's heads, and the children are so much happier!" Many mothers said: "In the past, the children were like 'little dirt donkeys,' and who cared about them? They cried straight through the day because of flies biting them, the children suffered, and the adults had more trouble; now the children are all clean, and there are no flies, so they will no longer fight with flies when they sleep, and adults and children are happy." The old men also said happily: "Today, the chicken and dog disasters are really gone! This is the benefit of cleaning every day, changing the soil every day, and paying attention to environmental hygiene. The effort was not in vain at all!"
    Now, in order to make cleaning and hygiene work a regular practice, the residents of Gushan Village have divided the area into four hygiene groups, established an inspection group to check and supervise in a timely manner, so as to consolidate the achievements already obtained from an organizational and systemic standpoint, and to continue the development of this good habit of loving hygiene. At the same time, everyone has realized that doing a good job in hygiene is a patriotic action. Therefore, every household in the village is signing patriotic hygiene pledges.

    青岛孤山村居民养成了讲卫生的习惯
    孙建华
    现在一走进青岛市沧口区的孤山村，就会有十分清爽的感觉。街上难以找得一点煤渣和垃圾。南面的一道垃圾沟已经修理成整洁的斜坡，就是那向来无人管的臭水沟也整理得干干净净了；每日的中午或晚上，沟边的几棵槐树底下，已成了人们休息、乘凉、读报的天然公园。随便走进那一户，都可以看到院子里十分整洁。鸡、鸭都养在新建的铺着石灰土的栏子里；猪子爬在新垫的黄土上。屋檐下一串串的地瓜、枣、咸鱼，和院中一盆盆的甜酱，也都盖上了洁白的纱布，饭锅都刷得崭亮，饭碗都放在有纱布或盖着布的碗筐里。每一个家庭，都可以随手取到苍蝇拍子。屋里的墙壁大部分都刷洗了，被、褥也都拆洗了一遍，臭虫、跳蚤极少见到。屋内墙根下，都撒着一层雪白的石灰，到处都可以见到捕鼠的陷阱。孩子们都能三两天洗一次澡，母亲们经常给他们洗衣服。大人除了定期洗换衣服以外，中午常到海边或到工人宿舍的澡塘里洗澡。家庭妇女都能定期地在晚上用温水洗澡。吃水的井已改良了七眼，离井近的厕所也都迁移了。
    孤山村的这种新气象，是从爱国卫生运动开展以来逐步出现的。现在这村居民讲求卫生的良好习惯，已经逐步养成，他们有个口头禅是：“干净是正经，‘拉塌’不像个家庭。不干不净吃了就容易生病。”现在，孩子头上很少发现虱子了，洗澡也成了习惯。张秀兰曾说过：“现在日子多了不洗澡，就觉着满身痒，睡都睡不着。”崔淑珍也说：“孩子的衣服、身上一时脏了，心里像觉着有个心事；趁着空把孩子收拾干净了，心里的石头才掉下来。”郭秀兰的母亲过去看着老鼠来回跑连睬也不睬；现在夜里只要一听到老鼠的动静，就非起来想办法捉住它不可。有时她为了捉一个老鼠一夜睡不安。张秀云说：“现在家里有一点不干净非随手扫扫不可。每天一睁眼，扫地、擦桌子这一套不干，就觉着不自在。”过去人们到街上买东西，很少有注意清洁卫生的；现在谁的摊子不讲卫生，没有纱罩，就别想有生意了。孩子们由于母亲们的教导，也养成了卫生习惯，没有喝冷水的了。大家都很注意环境卫生，脏土、污水都能自觉地倒在指定的地方去。
    过去每当夏季，这村子里常有生病的人。今年因为注意了环境卫生和个人卫生，又注射了防疫药针，基本上把病害根绝了。不少的居民一致反映：“这回我可真认识到政府领导开展卫生运动的好处了，今年生病的人比往年少了。”高滕氏说：“往年孩子的头叫虱子咬得长小疮；今年孩子头上没有虱子了，孩子们享多么大的福啊！”不少的母亲们说：“过去孩子们像‘小土驴’一样，谁还管他，白天睡觉叫苍蝇叮得直哭，孩子遭罪，大人也多添麻烦；现在孩子都干净了，苍蝇也没有了，睡觉的时候再也不会和苍蝇打仗了，大人孩子都享福。”老大爷们也高兴地说：“今天鸡灾、狗灾真没啦！这就是每天打扫，每天换土，讲环境卫生的好处，工夫半点没白遭啊！”
    现在，孤山村的居民们为了使清洁卫生工作经常化，他们一方面按区划分了四个卫生组，成立了一个检查组，及时检查督导，以便从组织上、制度上把已获得的成绩巩固下来，并使这种爱卫生的良好习惯继续发展。同时大家都体会到了作好卫生工作是一件爱国的行动，因此，全村家家户户正纷纷订立爱国卫生公约。（原载七月三日山东大众日报）
