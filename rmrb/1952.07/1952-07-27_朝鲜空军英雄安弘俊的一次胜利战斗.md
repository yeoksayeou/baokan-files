    A Victorious Battle of Korean Air Force Hero An Hongjun

    On a day of strong winds and thick clouds, the squadron led by the brave Korean People's Army Air Force pilot An Hongjun received orders to sortie and attack the enemy.

    They raised their silver iron eagles into the sky, crossing the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland and the peaceful towns brutally destroyed by the enemy, rushing towards their target with an eager heart of revenge. Below, the winding coastline and the azure sea could already be seen. Suddenly, from the gaps in the thick clouds, a group of black dots appeared. Twenty B-29 and B-26 bombers of the American bandits, under the cover of many Mustang and jet fighters, were flying forward, not knowing which peaceful village they were preparing to drop bombs and death on today.

    An Hongjun signaled his squadron by radio. He said, "Approximately forty enemy aircraft have been detected. For the motherland and the people, dedicate all our loyalty to General Kim Il-sung. The entire squadron, bravely attack!" He gripped the control stick tightly, guiding the young eagles of the Korean people to fight the hateful American aerial bandits. An Hongjun's squadron quickly ascended to high altitude, at which point the enemy aircraft formation was already further below them. "The entire squadron, bravely attack with sharp turns!" An Hongjun issued the order, and told his team members: "Now I will attack the enemy command plane!" He charged towards the enemy B-29 formation like a meteor, unleashing fierce fire on the middle of the fuselage of an enemy aircraft that had entered his sights. This B-29, which was rotating foolishly, immediately caught fire, emitted black smoke, and fell nose-down.

    "Shot down an enemy B-29!" An Hongjun reported the news while raising his plane. The attacked enemy aircraft group immediately scattered its formation. At this moment, an enemy jet fighter circling in a large circle on the right launched an attack on An Hongjun.

    An Hongjun keenly sensed the disadvantage of his position. He immediately turned to the left, flipping his fuselage over. The enemy plane thought An Hongjun's plane was going to fly to the right, so it rotated to the right. An Hongjun suddenly turned his nose and charged in the direction the enemy plane was flying. At this time, the enemy plane was rotating to the right. In this way, An Hongjun got a good opportunity to shoot at the enemy plane. The image of the enemy plane's fuselage and the pilot's flustered appearance had all entered the sight. In an instant, An Hongjun's plane spewed flames, hitting the nose of the enemy plane. The wounded enemy plane fled in panic. At this time, An Hongjun saw three enemy B-26s flying below and to his left, so he immediately rushed over and dived towards the foremost one, opening fire fiercely when he got very close. The nose of that enemy plane was hit by a series of bullets, and it plummeted to the other side of the mountain in a puff of smoke.

    Other members of An Hongjun's squadron also launched victorious attacks on the enemy aircraft. The utterly defeated American aerial bandits fled in panic to the west and south of the sea.

    On this very day, An Hongjun and his squadron achieved the brilliant results of shooting down and damaging one enemy B-29 bomber, two B-26 bombers, and two F-80 jet fighters. The silver eagles of An Hongjun's squadron returned to their base amidst songs of victory. (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜空军英雄安弘俊的一次胜利战斗
    在一个风劲云厚的日子，勇敢的朝鲜人民军空军驾驶员安弘俊率领的编队接到命令，出动袭击敌人。
    他们把银色的铁鹰升向天空，越过祖国秀丽的山河和受到敌人残暴破坏的和平城镇，怀着急切的复仇的心情，向目标驰去。底下，已经可以看到曲折多弯的海岸线和蔚蓝色的大海了，突然，从浓云缝隙中，出现了一群黑点，美国强盗的二十架B—二十九型和B—二十六型轰炸机在许多架野马式和喷气式战斗机的掩护下，正向前飞来，不知道他们今天准备又要把炸弹和死亡投到哪一个和平的村庄去。
    安弘俊用无线电向他的编队发出信号。他说：“发现了约四十架敌机。为了祖国和人民，把一切忠诚献给金日成将军，全机队勇敢突击！”他紧紧握住操纵杆，引导着朝鲜人民年青的神鹰向可恶的美国空中强盗搏斗。安弘俊的编队飞快地升上高空，这时，敌机编队已在他们较远的下方。“全机队以急回旋勇敢进攻！”安弘俊发出命令，并且告诉队员们：“现在我向敌指挥机进击！”他像流星似的向敌机B—二十九型编队直冲下去，对进入瞄准镜的一架敌机机身中间射出猛烈的火力。这架正在愚蠢地旋转着的B—二十九型机立刻起了火，冒出黑烟，机首向下坠落了。
    “击落敌B—二十九型机一架！”安弘俊一面报告着陆的消息，一面把飞机向上升起。受到袭击的敌机群立刻把队形散开。这时，正在右面绕着大圈的敌喷气式飞机，向安弘俊展开了攻击。
    安弘俊机警地感到了自己所处的位置的不利。他立刻向左侧回转，把机身翻了过来，敌机以为安弘俊的飞机要向右方飞去，便向右方旋转。安弘俊突然把机首转过来，向敌机飞来的方向冲过去。这时敌机正在向右旋转。这样，安弘俊得到了射击敌机的良机。敌机机体和驾驶员慌张失措的形象已全部进入瞄准镜内。刹那间，安弘俊的飞机吐出了火舌，击中了敌机的机首。受了伤的敌机慌忙逃脱。这时，安弘俊看到在他的左下方正有三架敌B—二十六型机在飞行，于是，他立即冲过去，向着最前面的一架俯冲下去，到距离很近的时候，他猛烈开动火器。那架敌机的机首中了一连串子弹，一溜烟坠落到山那一面去了。
    安弘俊编队的其他队员也向敌机进行了胜利的攻击。狼狈不堪的美国空中强盗向海的西、南两个方面仓惶遁去。
    就在这一天，安弘俊和他的机队取得了击落和击伤敌B—二十九型轰炸机一架、B—二十六型轰炸机两架和F—八十型喷气战斗机两架的光辉战果。安弘俊机队的银色的神鹰在胜利的歌声中回到自己的基地上。（新华社）
