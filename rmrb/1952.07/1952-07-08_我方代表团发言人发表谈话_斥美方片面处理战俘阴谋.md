Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 7th. Thanks to our side's renewed major efforts, the prisoner of war issue, which has long been deadlocked in the Korean armistice negotiations, has the potential to be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides. However, outside the meetings, the US side has publicly stated that it will unilaterally handle the prisoners of war. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Munsan on July 3rd, US spokesman Brigadier General Nuckols "explained to reporters" that before the signing of the armistice agreement, the US side would take "certain administrative actions" to "give those prisoners who refuse repatriation new identities so that they are no longer prisoners of war." Our reporter specifically interviewed the spokesman of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Armistice Negotiation Delegation on this matter, and he issued the following statement:

    The prisoner of war issue is under discussion, and any unilateral action to handle prisoners of war will undermine the entire basis of the discussion on the prisoner of war issue and is therefore absolutely unacceptable. Recently, due to the US side's preliminary change in its attitude of refusing negotiation, expressing its willingness to seek a "solution that meets the requirements of both sides to a reasonable extent" on the prisoner of war issue, our side suggested that, according to Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement that has been clearly agreed upon by both sides, all prisoners of war held by both sides should be released and repatriated when the armistice agreement comes into effect. According to Article 52, which was agreed upon to facilitate the prisoners of war returning home to live peaceful lives, stipulating that prisoners of war would no longer participate in the Korean War after repatriation, the prisoners of war on both sides should be reclassified according to nationality and region, and after correcting the lists accordingly, the prisoners of war on both sides could return home to live peaceful lives. Our side further suggested that the plenary session of the delegations of both sides enter into administrative meetings in order to earnestly discuss the above plan. Obviously, unilateral handling of prisoners of war in any form cannot "meet the requirements of both sides" and will inevitably make the resolution of the prisoner of war issue impossible, making the achievement of a ceasefire impossible. The US side, on the one hand, claims to be willing to seek a "solution that meets the requirements of both sides to a reasonable extent"; on the other hand, its spokesman openly stated that it would unilaterally handle prisoners of war. This shows that the US side has not only not abandoned its attempt to detain a large number of our captured personnel, but is also preparing to implement this conspiracy in a blatant and adventurous manner. In view of the important juncture at which the armistice negotiations are currently at, and in view of the serious consequences that may be caused by the US side's unilateral adventurous behavior, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army must remind the people of the world to be vigilant against the US side's new desperate plot to sabotage the armistice. We must solemnly warn the US side that we oppose the unilateral handling of our prisoners of war in any form. If the US side takes this action, it must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences it causes.

### 我方代表团发言人发表谈话  斥美方片面处理战俘阴谋

    我方代表团发言人发表谈话
    斥美方片面处理战俘阴谋
    【新华社开城七日电】由于我方再度重大努力，朝鲜停战谈判中僵持已久的战俘问题，已有可能获得双方满意的解决。但在会外，美方却公开表示将片面处理战俘。据美联社汶山七月三日电，美方发言人纳科斯准将“对记者解释”说：在停战协定签字前美方将采取“某些行政性的行动”，“赋予那些拒绝遣返的俘虏以新的身份，使他们不再是战俘”。记者特就此事走访朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团发言人，承其发表谈话如下：
    战俘问题正在讨论之中，任何片面处理战俘的行动，都将破坏战俘问题讨论的整个基础，因而是绝对不能容许的。最近由于美方初步改变其拒绝协商的态度，表示愿意对战俘问题寻求一个“在合理的程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，我方遂建议根据双方已明确协议的停战协定草案第五十一款在停战协定生效时，释放与遣返双方所收容的全部战俘的规定，和为了便于战俘回家过和平生活而协议的第五十二款关于战俘在遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争的规定，双方战俘按照国籍和地区重行分类，并据此校正名单后，使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活。我方更建议双方代表团大会进入行政性会议，以便切实商讨上述方案。显然，在任何形式下片面处理战俘的行为，都不能“适合双方要求”，而且必将使战俘问题的解决成为不可能，使停战的达成成为不可能。美方一方面号称愿寻求“在合理的程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”；另一方面其发言人竟公然表示要片面处理战俘，这说明美方不仅未放弃其扣留大批我方被俘人员的企图，而且更准备以明目张胆的冒险方式，来实行这一阴谋。鉴于停战谈判目前所处的重要关头，鉴于美方片面冒险行为可能引起的严重后果，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军必须提醒世界人民，警惕美方破坏停战的孤注一掷的新阴谋。我们必须郑重警告美方，我们反对在任何形式下片面处理我方战俘。如果美方采取这一行动，它所引起的严重后果美方必须负完全责任。
