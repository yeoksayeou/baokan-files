    Zhang Dewang Agricultural Production Cooperative Does a Good Job with Substitute Farming

    Editor: I am a military dependent from Niangniangmiao Village, Daming County, Hebei Province. My son has been in the army for eight years. Originally, the People's Government and the villagers took good care of me, but I was always dissatisfied with the substitute farming work in the past. In the past, substitute farming was done by temporarily assigning labor, and the people who came to help would leave after a while, regardless of the result of the substitute farming. For example, once, they planted eight hundred sweet potato seedlings for me, and four hundred of them died. This year, after the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative in the village, the substitute farming work has changed. In the spring, the district people's government issued me labor substitute farming work tickets and animal power substitute farming work tickets. I handed the work tickets and the land that needed substitute farming to the Zhang Dewang Agricultural Production Cooperative, and told them my opinions on planting these lands. Later, I was sick for several months and couldn't go to the fields to take a look. Zhang Dewang said to me: "We treat your land the same as the cooperative's land. We have a unified plan for how to plant in each season; we can't let the yield of your land be lower than that of ordinary land." Sure enough, my land was arranged very well. I am grateful to them. Zhang Dewang hurriedly said: "Isn't your son in the army to protect us!"

    张德旺农业生产合作社代耕工作做得好
    编辑同志：我是河北省大名县娘娘庙村的一个军属，我儿子参军八年了。本来，人民政府和老乡们都对我照顾得很好，但对代耕工作我过去总感到不满意。过去，代耕是用临时派工的办法，代耕的人来忙一阵就走了，不管代耕结果如何。譬如有一次，给我栽了八百棵山芋，就死了四百棵。今年村里成立了农业生产合作社以后，代耕工作改变了。开春时，区人民政府发给了我劳力代耕工票和畜力代耕工票。我把工票和应代耕的地交给了张德旺农业生产合作社，并把我对种这些地的意见告诉了他们。后来，我一直闹了好几个月的病，没能下地去看一下。张德旺对我说：“我们对你的地和社里的地一样看待。什么季节该怎么种，早就有了统一的打算；不能让你的地比一般地的产量低。”果然，我的地早被安排得好好的。我感谢他们。张德旺忙说：“你儿子在部队上，还不是为了保卫我们！”
