Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the Soviet "Bolshevik" magazine, issue No. 9, 1952, totaling over 17,000 words. What is published here is an abridged translation. This article first affirms the tremendous achievements of Soviet literature and art, while also focusing primarily on the major issues in various aspects of Soviet literature and art at present. These issues are also of great significance to the literary and artistic circles of New China today.

The Lenin-Stalin Party constantly cares about the growth and development of Soviet art and literature. Under the wise leadership of the Party, Soviet artists are using their excellent works to truthfully, historically significantly, concretely, convincingly, and vividly reflect reality in the revolutionary development of reality, and to help educate workers in the spirit of communism. In the period of transition from socialism to communism, the communist education of workers is of particular significance. To successfully solve the enormous tasks facing our people, it is necessary to raise the level of socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people and to arm them with the immortal ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Soviet writers are now using their works to define new lifestyles, to fight against some capitalist remnants in people's minds, and at the same time to help the Party and the Soviet state cultivate the Bolshevik ideological nature of the people, their spirit of not compromising with the remnants of the old world, and their spirit of not compromising with the evils in our lives.

Spiritual wealth is no less important to our people than material wealth. That is why every artistically successful work is regarded by the Soviet people as their own victory, comparable to a victory on the economic front or a great success. Conversely, every artistic failure makes our people, our Party, and our country very sad.

The annual awarding of Stalin Prizes to outstanding works in the fields of literature and art is proof of the fruitful work of our writers and artists. This year, thirty works by Soviet writers have won the Stalin Prize for 1951. Soviet literature is a literature of friendly unity among all nationalities: among the Stalin Prize winners are representatives of all nationalities of the Soviet Union—Russians, Latvians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, and people of other nationalities.

The first prizes of the Stalin Prize this year were awarded to Zlobin's novel "Stepan Razin" and Lācis's novel "To the New Shore."

The issue of peasant uprisings has always been of deep concern to Soviet writers. For example, Pushkin called Razin a poetic figure in Russian history. Those reactionary novelists tried to belittle the significance of peasant uprisings, describing repeated uprisings as blind rebellions against the "legitimate rule" of the Tsar and the landlord class. Soviet writers, based on Marxist-Leninist historiography, are able to give a profound and truthful picture of the historical people's movement in their works. Zlobin's novel "Stepan Razin" is the result of many years of creative labor.

Lācis's novel "To the New Shore" is an epic of the Latvian people, telling us how the people of this country broke away from the old bourgeois order and began to establish a new socialist order. The images of some Communist Party members, middle peasants, and representatives of the rich peasant class who have broken away from their class are depicted very successfully.

Soviet literature is first and foremost a literature of peaceful labor, a constructive literature. The noble theme of fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism has become an urgent and necessary theme of advanced literature. Soviet writers and poets are writing many works in various genres and in different languages ​​of the Soviet Union, dedicated to these ordinary people—the true heroes of our time. For example, Nikolai Tikhonov's series of poems "Two Torrents" and "At the Second World Peace Congress," the "Selected Poems" of Lithuanian poet Anastas Wenckus, the "Selected Poems" of Estonian poet Juhan Smuul, the Armenian poetess Shirva Gapchikeyan's collection of poems "My Relatives," and the "Collection of Poems" by the Ukrainian poet Mykola Nagnybida, all of which are filled with this thought and feeling and won the Stalin Prize in 1951.

The Stalin Prizes awarded to writer Belyayev for his trilogy "The Old Fortress," Oseyeva for her novella "Vasyok Trubachev and His Comrades," and Nosov for his novella "Vitya Maleev at School and at Home" all demonstrate the tremendous achievements of Soviet children's and youth literature.

It should be pointed out that some foreign writers also won the Stalin Prize this year. The works of these writers have been translated into Russian. The Chinese female writer Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," the French writer André Stil's novel "First Assault," the Chinese writer Zhou Libo's "Hurricane," the Hungarian writer Tamás Aczél's novel "Under the Banner of Freedom" and Sándor Nagy's short story "Reconciliation," and the Chinese playwrights He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's play "The White Haired Girl"—all the above-mentioned works prove the great achievements of foreign progressive writers who are fighting for the freedom, independence, and happiness of the people, and prove the positive influence of Soviet literature on foreign advanced literature.

The summary of the past year not only illustrates the success of artistic literature and criticism departments but also illustrates the shortcomings of these two departments. It is impossible not to attract attention to the fact that the number of writers who won the Stalin Prize this year has decreased significantly compared to last year. These quantitative indicators not only illustrate that the people's requirements for the ideological and artistic qualities of Soviet literary works are increasing but also illustrate some serious shortcomings in the creation of Soviet writers.

Particularly lagging behind the requirements of the times are dramatic creation and film script creation. In the works of Soviet playwrights, there was not even one who won the first and second prizes of the Stalin Prize in 1951.

Due to the depression of dramatic creation, theaters in the capital and other places can only stage very few new Soviet plays, and even these staged plays are far from satisfying the audience. Our dramatic criticism does not reveal the reasons why dramatic creation is lagging behind. In "Drama Magazine," "Art News," and "Literature News," those plays that cannot meet the requirements of the Soviet people are often given high evaluations. Critics praised many plays, simply because they were written with realistic themes from the lives of the working class and peasants, although life in these plays was only portrayed superficially, one-sidedly, and without interest.

The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Repertoire of Various Theaters and Measures for Its Improvement" pointed out: "The current situation in the repertoire of various theaters is unsatisfactory, also due to the lack of principled Bolshevik dramatic criticism." The resolution said that there are very few people who regularly express their opinions as dramatic critics; not enough new dramatic critics who can objectively and impartially analyze the plays and the performances of various theaters are promoted; individual critics do not evaluate dramatic works and performances based on the development of Soviet drama and stage art, in other words, not based on the interests of the country and the people, but based on the interests of small groups, friends, and personal interests. The shortcomings pointed out in the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on August 26, 1946, have not been completely eradicated to this day.

Of course, the fault for the serious lag in dramatic creation cannot be completely placed on the critics; the playwrights themselves must first be responsible. Soviet playwrights have not yet drawn all the necessary conclusions for themselves from the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Repertoire of Various Theaters and Measures for Its Improvement." The resolution pointed out:

"Many playwrights are indifferent to some fundamental issues of modern life. They are neither familiar with the lives and requirements of the people, nor are they good at expressing the excellent characteristics and qualities of the Soviet people."

In the years since the publication of the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), our playwrights have created some noteworthy works depicting the lives of the Soviet people and some fundamental issues of modern life. However, it is clear that many playwrights have not considered that to write urgent modern themes, they must deeply reveal the conflicts of reality. Everyone knows that what determines the significance of an artistic work is not only the theme but also whether the research on this theme is profound.

Some plays that have appeared in front of the Soviet audience in the past two years can be regarded as examples of our dramatic creation's superficial solution to the complex problems of life.

The reason why dramatic creation has fallen into such an unsatisfactory state is also because many Soviet writers and critics, as well as some staff members of the Art Affairs Committee and the Soviet Writers Association, had previously held erroneous understandings of several issues in the theory and practice of socialist realism, and the main one was the issue of conflict, which is the basis of dramatic works. Some writers and critics declared that even the word "conflict" should be forgotten for Soviet society.

This absurd statement tried to convince people that there were no conflicts in Soviet society; if there was only one form of conflict preserved in our lives, it would be the conflict between good and better. So those writers who believed in this harmful nonsense adopted a superficial patchwork method to create seemingly complete artistic works, creating some monotonous situations, fabricating conflicts between backward factory directors and the working masses or between backward collective farm chairmen and collective farm members, to replace the profound, creative study of life and its true reflection; those situations, from one play to another, from one novel to another, aroused the legitimate anger of Soviet audiences and readers. Works created based on that absurd "theory" of no conflict must whitewash reality and fail to spiritually arm readers and audiences to fight against the difficulties and those capitalist remnants in the daily lives and consciousness of Soviet people.

One of the fundamental requirements of socialist realism is to truthfully depict life in the revolutionary development of life. Comrade Stalin instructed us: "It would be terrible if we were infected with the disease of being afraid of the truth. There are many differences between Bolsheviks and any other political party, one of which is that they are not afraid of the truth and are not afraid to face the truth, no matter how bitter it is." (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 12, Page 9) Many playwrights and critics have forgotten Comrade Stalin's wise instructions.

Everyone knows that the struggle of opposites constitutes the content of the development process. In life, the struggle between the dying and the newborn, the outdated and the developing, the old and the new is always going on. Of course, the manifestation of this law in socialist society is different from that in a society divided into antagonistic classes. In class society, new things are produced and gain the right to exist in the process of intense class struggle. In socialist society, there are no longer antagonistic classes. But this does not mean that our new things will stand firm naturally without struggle, without contradictions, and without conflicts. We still have struggles, because the dying things are not willing to die, they still have to struggle for their existence. The struggle between the new and the old in Soviet society does not take the form of class struggle but the form of criticism and self-criticism. Soviet writers should use various artistic methods to truthfully reflect life and show this new, dialectical law of the development of Soviet society.

A writer can only reveal the inherent shortcomings of the backward people of our time with a full spirit and consciousness of hatred for capitalist remnants. Those shortcomings can be expressed in any form: such as being expressed in a narrow circle of business or unfounded empty plans, being expressed in fear of all new things or only shouting and not doing, being expressed in the idea of ​​promotion and wealth or bureaucracy, etc. In the struggle for the victory of new things, the Soviet Union, and communism, writers should simultaneously reveal those representatives of inertia and conservatism who hinder our progress towards communism. While pointing out the invincibility of new things and the inevitable demise of old things, Soviet writers should simultaneously help the Lenin-Stalin Party and carry out a sharp and uncompromising struggle against capitalist remnants.

Most Soviet writers and critics welcomed the fair and profound criticism of the "theory" of no conflict, which hindered the beneficial development of Soviet art, with great joy and gratitude. But there are still some individual comrades who have adopted an unprincipled stance on this issue, trying to defend their previous mistakes.

For example, the writer Weirda previously published an article in the "Soviet Art News" entitled "Works of Great Life Truth," in which he analyzed the film "Rural Doctor." In that article, Weirda asserted that it seemed that this film proved that there were no conflicts in our lives, that it seemed that the Soviet environment did not allow the conflict between those capitalist remnants in people's consciousness and communist consciousness to develop into complex, long-term, and dramatic oppositions, and that it seemed that conflicts had been replaced by some kind of "life torrent" here, and so on.

When the Party newspaper severely criticized the "theory" of no conflict, Weirda not only did not admit his mistake but adopted an offensive attitude; he even announced that he was a victim of those "officials" who destroyed drama. Weirda also published an article in that newspaper—"Soviet Art News"—entitled "Let's Talk Frankly..." In this article, he said that the reason for the occurrence of the "theory" of no conflict was that the staff of our criticism circles and repertoire censorship committees seemed to have given a head-on blow to "all lively, real, sharp, fresh, and non-formulaic things."

Weirda's article, as well as another article by Sherivinsky that appeared in the "Soviet Art News" after this article, described the real situation of dramatic creation in a way that did not match the facts, and they both showed an attempt to transfer the sins they deserved for making mistakes to others.

Weirda's words may have made some playwrights who had previously written some less successful plays think that maybe now they can put together some old works, maybe it is time to re-evaluate some plays that have been justly denied in the past. There are also some people who think that now it may be possible to re-evaluate Zoschenko's previous works, because he described the negative aspects of our lives. The above two views have nothing in common with the real tasks of Soviet literature and criticism. It should be known that Zoschenko did not appear in his past writings as someone who tried to use sharp satire to fight against the shortcomings in our lives; he appeared as a slanderer, a person who humiliated our reality, a person who unilaterally pointed out the darkest aspects of daily life, and he made untrue descriptions of our Soviet people.

Soviet writers should first correctly reflect life in all the complex phenomena of life. In life, there are still those who have not been liberated from the remnants of capitalism: smooth talkers, flatterers, hypocrites, bureaucrats, liars, and others. There are still conflicts between these people and advanced Soviet people, and this conflict can only be resolved as a result of a sharp and uncompromising struggle. It is not easy to fight this struggle, and it must be carried out with all our strength; this struggle is also very complicated, so it often becomes a long-term struggle. But in Soviet life, advanced Soviet people must overcome everything. They have overcome in the past, they are overcoming now, and they will certainly overcome in the future, because they are embodying all the best things in our society, because they have the support of the Party and the Soviet state. Soviet writers, only when they can show how the strong character of the Soviet people who are building a communist society is formed in struggle, in overcoming difficulties, and in some intense conflicts, can they complete their current major and glorious tasks.

Many shortcomings and errors that can be regarded as characteristics of artistic literature also exist in film script creation.

After the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues, the Soviet film industry created some noteworthy works in various genres. However, the film industry is far from meeting the growing demands of our people. The fact that only three films ("Taras Shevchenko," "Hero of the Golden Star," "Donetsk Miners") won the first and second prizes of the Stalin Prize this year is very worrying. This fact illustrates the serious lag in film—the most popular art. What is the reason for this lag? The reason is that many film scriptwriters have forgotten the conflict that is the driving force in any dramatic work and have begun to (intentionally or unintentionally) distortedly depict life, mainly focusing only on the bright and pleasant phenomena in life, and these phenomena can only stand firm in reality after a sharp and intense struggle with those things that are declining. The "theory" of no conflict, which can only simplify the work, has had a serious impact on some of the best films, reducing their ideological and artistic levels.

Let's take the film "Donetsk Miners," which won the Stalin Prize, as an example of film art. This is a good film. The director, the author of the film script, the actors, and the artists successfully and convincingly showed how the working conditions of miners are changing in our country, how the mechanization of this heavy department of human labor is becoming stronger day by day, how the Party and the government care about the miners, and how ordinary miners are respected by the people around them in our country. But the heroic and powerful theme of underground labor has many scenes in this film that are portrayed very easily, for example, like sitting in a house with velvet clothes on and the floor polished with yellow wax. The mine seen by the audience is almost like a perfect underground station with modern equipment. The huge tables filled with various foods and champagne in those white marble halls, and the extravagant weddings of the miners, occupy the primary position in the film, obscuring the daily working life of the miners. The miners want to see the precious truth of their warrior-like labor, which, even when it is being lightened as much as possible according to Comrade Stalin's fatherly instructions, is still very stressful in terms of both mental and physical strength. If there were more profound and moving shots of those difficult scenes in the film "Donetsk Miners," and a more convincing display of the process of overcoming these difficulties—including the portrayal of people's characters—then this film, like some other films, would have achieved great success from the audience and had a more powerful impact on them. This blandness is particularly evident in some films with the collective farm as the theme, such as the film "Abundant Summer," which gives people this feeling.

We do not pay attention to the development of the adventure story genre in film script creation at all. Everyone knows that the two Soviet films "The Exploits of a Scout" and "The Brave Ones," which are based on tense plots and are not completely without shortcomings, were very enthusiastically welcomed by the Soviet audience. These two films illustrate that tense and soul-grabbing plots can be combined with noble content, can be used as the basis for romantic stories depicting the Soviet people fighting against the enemy, and can be used as the basis for showing those powerful and strong-willed characters of our contemporaries. Is there a lack of materials in our lives that are sufficient to create tense plots for Soviet adventure stories? Is the nature of places like the great forests of Siberia, the Far East, the Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, the Pamirs, the Caucasus, and the Urals, and the diverse world of animals and plants in these places of our motherland, not enough to be used as the expression materials for films that combine attractive plots with knowledge of the greatness and wealth of socialist countries and combine the heroism and proactive and pragmatic character of the Soviet people?

The most important condition for creating good films is the high ideological and artistic nature of the film script, because: since it is called a film script, that is to say, the script for making a film, that is to say, a dramatic work prepared for screening on the screen. We have had many successful examples of the joint creation of film workers and Soviet writers. But at present, Soviet writers are not participating enough in the development work of this most popular art. Many film scripts written by Soviet writers are far from satisfying our audience. Soviet writers should draw important conclusions from this fact: that is, all very bad films that are criticized by the people are usually very poorly created and have no great value in terms of ideological or artistic literary film scripts. Soviet writers working in the film script creation department should think about their responsibility for the current situation in this most important part of our ideological work.

The Soviet people are expecting our artists to create works that can reflect the diverse aspects of our beautiful country's life, that can make people happy, that can call people forward, and that can arouse the good feelings and thoughts of the Soviet people.

1951 passed under the banner of the Soviet people's struggle to continuously improve the socialist economy and culture. Unprecedented large-scale construction in history, an amazing attack on nature, put forward some new national economic tasks and promoted many new people who can realize Comrade Stalin's instructions.

The construction of hydroelectric stations in Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka, the construction of several canals such as the Volga-Don, Turkmen, and North Crimean, all illustrate the extraordinary feats that the Soviet people can achieve under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party. Fully depicting these extraordinary feats is one of the noblest tasks of Soviet writers. In the past year, many Soviet writers have been to the places of great communist construction projects as "creative trips." Some essays and poems describing the great construction projects of our time have also appeared in the newspapers. But there has not yet appeared an essay or poem that can truly excite readers with its artistic integrity and ideological depth; there has not yet appeared an excellent long poem, novella, and novel about transforming nature and about the workers, engineers, and technicians engaged in various communist construction projects. Gorky said that our reality is majestic, so he called on writers to create broad pictures and epic comprehensive works. Soviet writers have not yet realized the last words of this great founder of socialist realism.

However, it would be wrong to think that Soviet writers are avoiding describing the working class. In 1951, some works describing this theme did appear, such as Boris Gorbatov's newly published novel "Donbass" Part 1, Avdiyenko's novel "Labor," and Olga Kiyu's novel "Busy Times," all of which describe this theme.

Among the recently created works describing the Soviet working class, the novel "The Zhurbin Family" by the young Leningrad writer Kochetov can be regarded as an outstanding work.

However, despite the significant achievements in studying the theme of the working class and the collective farm peasants, and in many works written by workers and collective farm members, there is still a common shortcoming: these works portray their protagonists only unilaterally, only in production. Technology, competition, and production plans often cover up the living people who master technology, participate in competitions, and struggle to complete production plans.

The Soviet people are carrying out great social and political work, studying, often going to the theater, arguing with friends about some of the most important issues in life, considering family, new morality, and some issues of human relations, rejoicing and burning with enthusiasm, loving and hating. But many of our writers limit their creative vision to the part of the Soviet people's time that is directly dedicated to labor. Some writers and critics despise everything outside of collective labor, calling it "daily life" and not paying attention to it at all. Many writers have gradually deprived or almost deprived their protagonists of everything unrelated to direct production activities from the circle of life interests, so the works created with materials from the lives of the working class will naturally appear poor.

The opponents of "daily life" have forgotten some of the excellent traditions of Russian classical literature. We may as well recall Pushkin's poem "Eugene Onegin." The poet portrayed the various aspects of the lives and psychology of his protagonists so truthfully and deeply that Belinsky called this work "an encyclopedia of Russian life." We may as well recall how Tolstoy and other classical Russian writers portrayed the various aspects of the lives of the protagonists in their works. It is this description that helped them fully show the picture of the lives of their contemporaries and more completely and clearly portray people's characters.

It should be remembered that correctly showing life is helpful to people's communist education. It should be known that it is in daily life that those remnants of the damn past that hinder our progress and those that should be eliminated will be more clearly expressed. A writer should help the people move forward and help them move towards communism when he exposes those shortcomings in our daily lives.

Of course, paying attention to daily life does not mean that we artists should abandon the description of the Soviet people's production activities in their works. It would also be very wrong to use another extreme—only describing the protagonist's daily life—to replace this extreme—only describing the worker in production. To complete a vivid work describing our contemporaries—communist builders—it must be done in such a way that he is portrayed both in production and in daily life, that is to say, he is portrayed within the entire scope of a person's activities; because the basic requirement of socialist realism is to give life some true, historically significant, and concrete pictures.

Soviet writers have not helped the music workers enough in creating excellent musical works. This year, only one opera—Estonian composer Kapp's "Singer of Freedom"—won the second prize of the Stalin Prize.

The Party called on composers to create exquisite Soviet operas. In its resolution "On Muradeli's Opera 'The Great Friendship,'" the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) criticized the formalistic tendency in Soviet music, which is in fact anti-people and leads music art to the road of destruction. In recent years, Soviet composers have created some noteworthy works. However, to this day, all the conclusions that must be drawn from this resolution have not been drawn. Some composers and authors of opera lyrics understand the struggle against formalism to mean giving up improving writing skills and relying on primitivism and simplification. Such a poor and primitive opera as Zhukovsky's opera "Wholeheartedly," which was justly criticized by Soviet public opinion, belongs to that category.

Is this only the fault of those music workers? Of course not. Just as the theater cannot have good plays if it does not have valuable scripts, and there cannot be moving films if there are no suitable film scripts, a real opera cannot be written if there are no good lyrics. Music workers have repeatedly raised the issue of jointly creating magnificent operas facing the broad masses of the people with writers, but writers are not helping musicians enough at present. Composers and writers have not been able to create outstanding Soviet operas about our contemporaries.

The Soviet people are not only expecting valuable and magnificent musical works but also new and talented songs. In recent years, Soviet poets and composers have created many good songs, especially songs about the struggle for peace. But there are no songs like those that can make the Soviet people put their inner lyrical tenderness, their pride in being builders of a new world, and their love for the motherland into them. In the pre-war and war periods, many such songs were produced: such as the "March of the Motherland," "Katyusha," "The Sacred War," and many other pure and sincere Soviet songs that reflect the thoughts and aspirations of our outstanding people.

The Soviet people, who are moving towards communism, are growing rapidly. The requirements of readers and audiences for artistic works have been greatly improved. What could satisfy the Soviet people a year or two ago can no longer satisfy them today. They have raised great demands on both the ideological depth and artistic skills of artistic works. The Soviet people's desire for art is not only to hope that its level will increase with their growth but also to hope that art can better help promote our people forward in order to reach new heights of human culture. Many Soviet literary works have not yet met this reasonable requirement of the people.

In order to complete the above-mentioned huge tasks put forward to artists in various forms, Soviet writers should deeply study life, continuously improve themselves ideologically, and continuously master their artistic skills.

To this day, there is still an uneradicated decadent fallacy among some writers that is hindering the future development of Soviet art, which says that the main and only task of artists is to find good modern themes and explain them with the correct ideological position.

The supporters of this "theory" believe that artistic skill is a secondary matter. They say, let those formalists engage in artistic skills. Therefore, some writers and critics do not pay enough attention to the issue of artistic skills at all. This is particularly evident in the poetry department. The poems of many poets are difficult to read because these poems are like those formulized bad essays and institutional reports. In these poems, there is neither deep emotion, nor vivid life experience, nor memorable images. These poems cannot excite readers but are only sufficient to arouse their reasonable annoyance.

Of course, the contemporaneity of the theme has its own great significance. True Soviet artists cannot avoid solving those modern themes, and they cannot but explain them from the standpoint of an advanced worldview, otherwise, they must destroy the truth of life. But the issue of artistic skills is by no means a secondary issue. It is time to understand that taking a sloppy attitude towards skills not only reduces the artistic level of the work but also inevitably reduces its ideological level. Artistically immature works, that is to say, works like those whose images are rarely expressive, whose structure is chaotic, whose language is not refined, and so on, no matter what good ideas they have, they still cannot realize the author's intentions, because such works will not be accepted by readers, they cannot open up new aspects of life for them, and they cannot help them in the struggle for communism. Art belongs to the people and serves the people. A writer who sloppily treats the issue of artistic skills should not dream of the lofty title of engineer of the human soul, a writer of the people. Moreover, he must also be abandoned by the people. Can a bad architect or a bad engineer be trusted to build a good house? Therefore, it is even more impossible to believe that a bad writer can participate in the construction of that "invisible fortress"—the fortress of the people's soul.

There is also another extreme among Soviet artists: that is, many people are still fascinated by the concept of "innovation." Under this circumstance, their understanding of true innovation is only superficial, treating it as the capital of new techniques that other artists do not know. The supporters of this theory believe that every new work of Soviet art must only be done according to innovative methods. Not every innovative activity can be regarded as a truly innovative activity. The most outstanding Soviet artists, such as Gorky and Mayakovsky, truly and vividly reflected the revolutionary struggle and the new life of our people, created some excellent works based on the excellent traditions of classical art. These works are enough to thrill readers both in terms of the depth of the ideas they express and the perfection of artistic skills, because these works truthfully and very brilliantly reflected reality in the revolutionary development of reality and helped educate the working people in the spirit of the lofty ideals of communism. But the so-called innovation of the formalists is of a completely different nature. The supporters of this school completely do not consider the true reflection of life but only want to surprise readers with beautiful words. There is no question that any affectation, pretentiousness, and tricks are very far from true innovation, just as the unthinking works of the formalists are far from true art. True artists never think that innovation is "innovation for the sake of innovation." New things should only be better than the old when they have gained the right to exist.

All Soviet writers should understand that fighting for a high degree of ideological and artistic skill is fighting for the people's nature of Soviet literature and for strengthening its influence on the masses. Only that Soviet writer who can truly express the life of the people and help the people move forward is worthy of being called the engineer of the human soul. Our people have grown immeasurably. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed in its resolution "On the Film 'The Great Life'": "The Party and the state will also cultivate the people's good taste in artistic works and a strict attitude of requirements in the future."

There are still many serious shortcomings in Soviet literature and Soviet criticism circles. The Party and Comrade Stalin have handed us the unrusting weapon of fighting against various shortcomings—criticism and self-criticism. The Party teaches us: without criticism, any institution will be corrupted, without criticism, any disease will take root in the institution, and it will be difficult to cure in the future. Those who are afraid of criticism are shameful cowards. Without criticism, there is no progress. Vigorously unfolding the most important creative discussions related to literature and art will definitely help our writers and critics eradicate the serious shortcomings in their work and create some excellent works needed by the people.

It is necessary to thoroughly expose those literary workers: they do not base their mutual relations on their careers but on the interests of their friends. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed in its resolution of August 14, 1946: "This liberalism, which sacrifices the interests of the people and the interests of the country in order to preserve friendship, sacrifices the interests of the correct education of our youth, and suppresses criticism, results in writers no longer seeking further study, losing their sense of responsibility to the people, to the country, and to the Party, and stopping progress."

There is no doubt that relying on the Party's sharp criticism and Comrade Stalin's fatherly care, Soviet artists will be able to find the creative power in themselves to solve those new and more difficult tasks they face. Let us all recall 1946, the Party has never been so strict and sharply criticized the serious shortcomings and errors of all the workers in the art department as it did at that time. As a result, the artists found the strength in themselves, realistically estimated the situation, and revealed the reasons why the errors and shortcomings occurred at that time.

The Party has handed down an outline for the further development of Soviet art. Soviet literature has repaid the Party and the people with some major, rich, and modern works.

As is well known, theatrical creation has its own special characteristics. In order for everyone to fully accept the script, it is not enough to recite it like a novel or a poem, it must also meet everyone on the stage. Therefore, to achieve the successful development of theatrical creation, it can only be done under the condition of close cooperation between the playwrights and the various theaters. In recent years, the connection between playwrights and various theaters has been very insufficient; this connection must be strengthened by all means. In this regard, we have begun to take important steps. However, some writers have such an idea: they think that strengthening the connection between playwrights and theaters means that the Art Affairs Committee will cancel the supervision of their work. It is unlikely that this primitive anarchistic way of raising questions will help to correctly and fruitfully solve those important tasks currently facing Soviet artists.

Our theatrical creation has a strong team composed of many talented, infinitely creative, and experienced Soviet playwrights in its ranks. Every year, more and more new people enter theatrical creation. At this complicated time in its own life, the theater world should call for help from writers of other literary styles in order to correct some of the shortcomings of modern theater. We have all the practical materials to answer the results of the Party's resolution "On the Repertoire of Various Theaters and Measures for Its Improvement," that is, the torrent formed by many new and talented Soviet scripts, which is likely to ensure that every theater stages two to three thoughtful and artistic plays written with modern and active themes every year, which are perfect and very talented.

We must also eliminate the backward phenomena in the film department. We just need to overcome inertia. Because there are masters in the film world who are good at writing and can write. There are also good and complete experiences of creating excellent film scripts in the film, according to which, some magnificent films have been created in the Soviet Union, which have triumphantly walked around the world. Grasping this experience, grasping this cadre of film script authors, and greatly expanding this cadre organization by attracting talented writers, we will definitely be able to eliminate the "weaknesses" in the film department.

Soviet writers, whether in theatrical creation, film script creation, opera creation, or poetry creation, have no right to lag behind. They should help the development of art that is closely related to them—such as drama, film, and music—in all ways.

Soviet literature has rich creative experience. In all its styles, there are some works that are innovative in nature and have entered the treasure house of new socialist culture. In the literature of all brother countries in the Soviet Union, there have also grown huge teams of talented literary masters.

Relying on huge creative experience, and having strength due to the excellent traditions of their pioneers—classical writers—Soviet literary workers will definitely be able and should create some immortal, highly ideological and artistic works.

The Party has clearly indicated the road we should take. On this road, we will definitely be able to create works worthy of those who are building communism in our country under the leadership of the Party and according to the genius plans of Lenin and Stalin.

    苏维埃文学发展的几个问题
    苏联  苏尔科夫
    编者按：本文原载苏联一九五二年第九期“布尔什维克”杂志，共一万七千多字，发表在这里的是经过删节的译文。这篇文章首先肯定了苏联文学艺术的巨大成绩，同时又以主要篇幅论述了目前苏联文学艺术各方面的主要问题。这些问题，对当前新中国的文艺界来说，也是有很大意义的。
    列宁—斯大林底党，是不断地关怀着苏维埃艺术与文学底成长和发展的。苏维埃艺术家，都正在党底英明的领导之下，用他们底优秀作品在现实底革命的发展中真实地、富有历史意义地、具体地、令人折服而鲜明地反映着现实，以共产主义精神帮助教育劳动者。在由社会主义过渡到共产主义这一时期，劳动者底共产主义教育是具有特殊意义的。要想成功地解决摆在我们人民面前的那些巨大的任务，那就得全靠提高广大人民大众底社会主义的觉悟底水平，并尽力以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、以及斯大林底不朽的思想来武装他们。苏维埃作家，现在就是一面以他们底作品确定新的生活方式、跟人们意识中的一些资本主义残余作斗争，同时并帮助党和苏维埃国家培养人民底布尔什维克的思想性，培养他们那种不跟旧世界的残余作妥协的精神，培养他们那种不跟我们生活中的恶事作妥协的精神。
    精神上的财富对于我国人民来说，其重要性并不亚于物质的财富。这就是为什么每一部艺术上成功的作品，苏维埃人民都把它看作是自己底胜利，都把它比作是经济战线上的胜仗或是巨大的成功。反之，每一个艺术上的失败，就也使我们的人民、我们的党、我们的国家都非常的难过。
    ×××
    每年对文学与艺术部门一些杰出的作品授予斯大林奖金，这就是我们文学家与艺术工作者底工作富有成果的证明。苏维埃作家底作品，今年又有三十部荣获了一九五一年度的斯大林奖金。苏维埃文学，这是各民族友好团结的文学：在斯大林奖金获得者之间有苏联各民族的代表——俄罗斯人、拉脱维亚人、乌兹别克、乌克兰人，以及其他各民族的人。
    今年荣获斯大林奖金一等奖的，是兹洛宾底长篇小说“斯捷潘·拉辛”和拉吉斯底长篇小说“到新岸去”。
    农民起义这个问题，向来就是为苏维埃作家们所深切注意的。例如普希金就把拉辛叫作俄国历史上的富于诗意的人物。那些反动的小说家，都曾力图贬低农民起义的意义，把屡次的起义都描写成反抗沙皇和地主阶级底“合法的统治”的盲目的暴动。而苏维埃作家，则是依据着马克思—列宁主义的历史编纂学，所以能够在自己底作品中赋予历来的人民运动以深刻而真实的画面。兹洛宾底长篇小说
    “斯捷潘·拉辛”，就是多年来创作劳动的成果。
    拉吉斯底长篇小说“到新岸去”，是拉脱维亚人民的史诗，它告诉了我们这个国家底人民是怎样跟那些旧的资产阶级秩序断绝了关系，并开始在建立新的社会主义秩序。一些共产党员底形象、中农底形象、以及一些跟自己阶级脱离了关系的富农阶级代表人物的形象，都描写得很成功。
    苏维埃文学，它首先就是和平劳动的文学，富于建设性的文学。为争取和平、民主、社会主义而斗争的高尚的主题，已成了先进文学迫切必需的主题。苏维埃作家和诗人们就是在用各种不同的体裁、用苏联各民族不同的语言写成许多作品，献给这些普通的人们——我们时代底真正英雄。如荣获一九五一年的斯大林奖金的尼古拉·吉洪诺夫底组诗“两条巨流”和“在第二届世界和平大会上”，立陶宛诗人阿纳斯达斯·温茨洛夫底“诗选集”，爱沙尼亚诗人尤汗·什姆尔底“诗选”，阿尔明尼亚女诗人希里娃·加普奇凯亚恩底诗集“我底亲近的人们”，乌克兰诗人米科拉·纳格尼别德底“诗集”，就都充满了这种思想和感情。
    作家别里亚耶夫以其三部曲“古老的堡垒”、奥谢耶娃以其中篇小说“瓦小克·特鲁巴乔夫和他底同学们”、诺索夫以其中篇小说“维加·马列耶夫在学校和在家里”而获得了斯大林奖金，这都证明了苏维埃儿童和少年文学发展的巨大成就。
    应当指出，在本年还有一些外国的作家也荣获了斯大林奖金。这些作家底作品都已译成了俄文。中国女作家丁玲底长篇小说“太阳照在桑乾河上”，法国作家安得莱·斯提尔底长篇小说“第一次打击”，中国作家周立波底“暴风骤雨”，匈牙利作家达马斯·亚采尔底长篇小说“在自由的天幕下”和山多尔·纳第底短篇小说“和好”，中国剧作家贺敬之和丁毅等合写的剧本“白毛女”，——所有上述这些作品，都证明了外国的那些为人民底自由、独立和幸福而斗争的进步作家们底重大成就，都证明了苏维埃文学对外国的先进文学所发生的良好的影响。
    过去这一年的总结，不仅说明了艺术文学部门和批评部门的成功，同时也说明了这两个部门的缺点。这样的事实，已不能不引人注意——今年荣获斯大林奖金的作家的人数，比起去年来是显著地减少了。这些数量上的指标，不仅说明了人民对于苏维埃文学作品底思想性与艺术性的质量方面的要求正在提高，同时也说明了苏维埃作家们创作方面的一些严重的缺点。
    特别落后于时代要求的，是戏剧创作和电影剧本创作。在苏维埃剧作家底作品里，连一个获得了一九五一年斯大林头等奖和二等奖的都没有。
    由于戏剧创作的不景气，使首都与各地的剧院只能上演很少很少的新的苏维埃剧本，而且就是这些上演的剧本，也都远不能使观众满意。我们的戏剧批评，也不去揭发戏剧创作所以落后的原因。在“戏剧杂志”、“艺术报”以及“文学报”上，对于那些不能满足苏维埃人民要求的剧本，常常予以很高的评价。批评家们赞赏了好多剧本，那只是为了它们都是用工人阶级和农民生活中一些现实的主题而写成的，虽然在这些剧本里，生活都只是被表现得很浮浅、片面，而没有兴趣。
    在联共（布）中央委员会底“关于各剧院演出剧目及其改进办法”的决议中曾经这样指出：“目前各剧院剧目方面的情形所以不能令人满意，也由于缺乏富于原则性的布尔什维克的戏剧批评。”决议里说，以戏剧批评家的资格经常发表意见的人，简直就少得可怜；对于那些真正能够客观地、不偏不倚地去分析剧本与各剧院演出情形的新的戏剧批评家，也提拔得不够；个别的批评家在予戏剧作品及演出的情形以评价时，都不是以苏维埃戏剧和舞台艺术发展为指针的，换言之，也就是不以国家和人民底利益为依归，而是以小集团、朋友、私人底利益为依归的。在一九四六年八月二十六日联共（布）中央委员会底决议里所指出的那些缺点，直到今天还没有完全根除。
    当然，戏剧创作严重落后现象的过错，不能都完全加在批评家底身上，首先还得由剧作家们自己去负责。苏维埃剧作家，都还没有从联共（布）中央委员会底“关于各剧院演出剧目及其改进办法”的决议中为自己作出全部必要的结论。决议指出说：
    “许多剧作家对于现代生活底一些根本问题都是袖手旁观，他们既不熟悉人民底生活与要求，又不善于表现苏维埃人底优良特征和品质。”
    在联共（布）中央委员会底决议公布以后的这几年中，我们剧作家是创作了一些值得注意的描写苏维埃人生活和现代底一些根本问题的作品。但是，很显然，还有许多剧作家没有考虑到：要写迫切的现代主题，就一定得深刻地去揭发那些现实的冲突。大家都知道，决定艺术作品意义的不只是主题，同时也还要看对于这个主题的研究是否深刻。
    近两年来出现在苏维埃观众面前的一些剧本，可以把它们看作只是我们戏剧创作对于生活中那些复杂问题底表面上解决的例子。
    戏剧创作所以陷于那样不能令人满意的现状，也由于许多的苏维埃作家和批评家，也都一如艺术事业委员会和苏联作家协会底一些工作人员一样，在不久之前对于社会主义现实主义理论与实践方面的若干问题，都还抱着错误的理解，而主要的，又是作为戏剧作品中基础的那个冲突问题。某些作家和批评家就都是那样宣称——甚至连“冲突”这个字眼，对于苏维埃社会来说，都应该把它忘掉。
    这种妄诞的说法，曾千方百计地使人相信：在苏维埃社会里已经没有了冲突；如果说在我们生活中还保存有唯一的冲突的形式，那便是好与较好之间的冲突。于是那些相信了这种有害的胡说八道的作家们，就采取了一种浮浅的拼凑的手法使人在形式上看来是一些完整的艺术作品里，弄出了些千篇一律的情况，杜撰出一些落后的厂长与工人群众之间或是落后的集体农庄主席与集体农庄庄员们之间的冲突来，以代替那种深刻的、创作上的生活研究及其真实的反映；那些情况，从这一剧本转到另一剧本，从这一长篇小说转到另一长篇小说，引起了苏维埃观众和读者们底合理的激怒。根据那种妄诞的没有冲突的“理论”而创作出的作品，就一定要粉饰现实，不能在精神上武装读者和观众去跟困难、跟苏维埃人们日常生活中与意识中的那些资本主义残余作斗争。
    社会主义现实主义底根本要求之一，便是在生活底革命的发展中真实地描写生活。斯大林同志指示我们说：“假使我们要传染上了害怕真理的毛病，那可就糟了。布尔什维克跟任何其他政党不同的地方很多，其中之一，就是他们不害怕真理，不害怕正视真理，无论它是多么苦。”（斯大林文集第十二卷第九页）好些剧作家和批评家，都把斯大林同志这个英明的指示给忘了。
    大家都知道，对立的斗争，构成发展过程底内容。在生活中永远进行着垂死的与新生的、过了时的与正在发展的、旧的与新的斗争。当然，在社会主义社会里这个规律底表现，是跟在分成敌对的阶级社会里不同的。在阶级社会里，新的东西是在紧张的阶级斗争的过程中产生并获得存在权利的。在社会主义社会里，已经没有了敌对的阶级。但这并不等于说，我们的新东西就都是没有斗争、没有矛盾、没有冲突，自然而然地就会站稳脚步的。我们还有斗争，因为即将死亡的东西，并不甘心死亡，它还要为自己底存在而挣扎。新与旧的斗争在苏维埃社会采取的不是阶级斗争的形式，而是批评与自我批评的方式。苏维埃作家应当用种种艺术方法真实地反映生活，显示苏维埃社会发展的这一新的、辩证的规律性。
    一个作家，只有用全副的精神与意识去仇视资本主义残余，才能够揭露我们时代落后人们底那些内在的缺点。那些缺点会以任何形式表现出来：如表现在狭隘的事务主义圈子里或是无根据的空洞计划，表现在害怕所有的新鲜事物或是只嚷不做，表现在升官发财思想或是官僚主义等等。在为新事物、苏维埃、共产主义底胜利而斗争时，作家们应当同时揭露那些妨碍我们向共产主义迈进的因循懒惰，墨守陈规的代表人物。在指出新事物的不可征服性与旧东西底必然的灭亡时，苏维埃作家应该同时帮助列宁—斯大林底党和资本主义残余进行尖锐的、不妥协的斗争。
    大多数的苏维埃作家和批评家，都是带着莫大的喜悦与感激的心情迎接了那种妨碍了苏维埃艺术有利发展的、没有冲突的“理论”所遭受的公正而深刻的批评。但是还有一些个别的同志，对于这个问题采取了无原则的立场，力图辩护自己从前的错误。
    例如作家维尔达，从前就在“苏维埃艺术报”上发表过一篇论文“重大的生活真实的作品”，在这篇文章里，他对于影片“乡村医生”作了一番分析。在那篇论文里，维尔达断言说，似乎这个影片就证明我们生活中已经没有了冲突，似乎苏维埃环境就不许可人们意识中的那些资本主义残余跟共产主义意识之间的冲突也会发展成复杂的、长期的、富于戏剧性的对立，似乎冲突在我们这儿已为某种“生活的巨流”所代替，以及诸如此类的论调。
    而当党报把那种没有冲突的“理论”严厉地批评过了之后，维尔达不仅没有承认自己底错误，反而采取了进攻的态度；竟宣布说他是那些摧残戏剧的“官员们”底牺牲品。维尔达还在那个报纸——“苏维埃艺术报”上发表过这样一篇论文“我们要坦白地谈谈……”在这篇论文里，他说那种没有冲突的“理论”所以发生的原因，是由于我们的批评界和剧目检查委员会的工作人员们似乎对“所有生动的、真实的、尖锐的、新鲜的、不公式化的东西”都给与了迎头痛击。
    维尔达底一篇论文以及继这篇论文之后仍旧在那个“苏维埃艺术报”上出现的谢里温斯基底另一篇论文，都是把戏剧创作的真正情况，说得与事实不符，他们都表现出了那样的企图——把自己因犯错误而应得的罪过转嫁与人。
    维尔达底话，可能使若干从前写过一些成功不大的剧本的剧作家产生那么一种想法——也许，现在又可以把从前一些旧的作品凑合着搬出来了，也许，对于从前某些已经作了公正的否定评价的剧本，现在是重新评价的时候了。也还有一些人会这么想：现在就是对于左琴科从前的一些作品，也可能予以重新评价了，因为他是描写了我们生活中否定的方面呀。上述两种看法，都是跟苏维埃文学与批评的真正任务，没有丝毫共同之点的。要知道左琴科在他过去所写的那些东西里面，他并不是以企图用尖锐的讽刺去跟我们生活中那些缺点作斗争的人的姿态而出现的，他是以一个诽谤者、污辱我们现实的人的姿态、是用日常生活中最黑暗的方面片面地指摘我们现实的人的姿态而出现的，他对于我们苏维埃人作了不真实的描写。
    苏维埃作家首先应该在全部生活底复杂现象中正确地反映生活。在生活中，还有的是那些还没有从资本主义的残余中解放出来的人：八面玲珑的人、阿谀逢迎的人、伪君子、官僚主义者、说谎者，以及其他等等。在这些人和先进的苏维埃人之间还存在着冲突，而这种冲突又只有在尖锐的、不妥协的斗争的结果中才能解决。作这种斗争是很不容易的，要竭尽全力来进行；这种斗争也是很复杂的，因此往往成为长期性的斗争。但是在苏维埃生活中，先进的苏维埃人们一定是战胜一切的。他们过去是战胜了，现在正战胜着，并且将来也一定战胜，因为他们正在体现着我们社会中所有的最好的东西，因为他们有党和苏维埃国家在支持他们。苏维埃作家，只有在他们能把那些正在建设共产主义社会的苏维埃人们底坚强性格是如何在斗争中、在克服困难中、在一些紧张的冲突中形成的情形都表现出来，那时他们才能完成其当前的重大而光荣的任务。
    可作为艺术文学底特征的那许多缺点和错误，在电影剧作方面也都有。
    在联共（布）中央委员会底关于意识形态诸问题的决议之后，苏维埃电影界曾用各种不同体裁创造了一些值得注意的作品。但是电影界还是远未能满足我们人民日益提高的要求。今年只有三部影片
    （“达拉斯·塞夫琴科”、“金星英雄”、“顿尼茨矿工”）获得了斯大林奖金一等奖和二等奖这
    一事实，是非常令人担心的。这一事实说明了电影——这一最富于群众性的艺术底严重落后现象。这种落后现象的原因，究竟又在什么地方呢？这个原因，就是在于许多电影剧作家都把那个作为任何戏剧作品中动力的冲突给忘了，并且开始去（有意地或是无意地）歪曲地描写生活，主要地，是把注意力只放在生活中那些光明的、愉快的现象上，而这些现象，也只有在跟那些正在衰颓着的东西作过尖锐的、紧张的斗争之后，它们才能在现实中站稳脚步。那种只能使作品简单化的没有冲突的“理论”，就是对于某些最好的影片也有了严重的影响，减低了它们底思想—艺术的水平。
    我们就拿那部获得了斯大林奖金的影片“顿尼茨矿工”这一电影艺术作品来看吧。这是一部好影片。导演、电影剧本底作者、演员们、美工师们都成功地、令人折服地表现出了：矿工底劳动条件，在我国是如何地在改变，对于人类劳动底这一繁重部门的机械化，又是如何一天一天地在稳固，党和政府对于矿工们，又是如何地关怀，普通的矿工，在我国又是如何受到周围人的尊敬。但地下劳动这一英勇有力的主题，在这个影片中有许多场面都被表现得很轻松，比方说吧，就像穿着天鹅绒的衣服坐在用黄腊打光了地板的房子里一般。观众看见的矿坑，就跟具有现代化设备的完善的地下车站差不多。在那些白大理石的大厅里摆满了各种食品和香槟酒的巨大的餐桌、矿工们大肆铺张的婚礼，在影片中占了首要的地位，掩蔽了矿工们底日常劳动生活。而矿工们却是想看见他们自己那种勇士般的劳动底可贵的真实，这种劳动，即使是在这按照着斯大林同志底慈父一般的指示，尽力使之减轻的时候，而工作起来，无论是在脑力和体力方面，都还是要非常的紧张的。要是在“顿尼茨矿工”这部影片里，对于那些困难的场面能有更深刻动人的镜头，对于克服这些困难的过程——这其中就包括着人们性格的刻画，也能有更令人折服的显示，那么，这部影片也就会跟其他一些影片那样，可以从观众们那里取得莫大的成功，并给他们以更有力的影响。这种平淡性，在某些用集体农庄作主题的影片里，表现得尤为显著，如“丰盛的夏天”那部影片就令人有这种感觉。
    我们对于电影剧作中的冒险故事体裁的发展，完全不予以注意。大家都知道，那两部以紧张的情节为基础，并不是完全没有缺点的苏维埃影片“侦察员底功勋”和“勇敢的人们”，就都受到苏维埃观众非常热烈的欢迎。这两部影片说明了：紧张的、能抓住人们心灵的情节，是可以和高尚的内容结合起来的，是可以作为表现苏维埃人跟敌人作斗争的浪漫故事底基础的，是可以作为显示我们同时代的那些强有力的、意志坚强的性格底基础的。难道说，在我们的生活中，足以创作苏维埃冒险故事影片底紧张情节的材料还少么？难道说，像西伯利亚底大森林、远东、阿尔泰山、天山、帕米尔、高加索、乌拉尔等地的大自然，我们祖国这些地方的各色各样的动植物世界，还不足以作为：把吸引人的情节和社会主义国家底伟大与财富的知识结合在一起，把苏维埃人底英雄主义与积极务实的性格结合在一起的那些影片底表现材料吗？
    创造好电影最重要的条件，就是电影剧本底高度的思想性与艺术性，因为：既然名之曰电影剧本，那就是说为了要拍制电影的剧本，也就是说，准备在银幕上放映的戏剧作品。在电影工作者和苏维埃作家共同创作这一方面，我们已有了不少的成功的例子。可是在现时，苏维埃作家们对于这一最大众化的艺术底发展工作，却参与得不够。有好些由苏维埃作家所写成的电影剧本，都远不能使我们的观众满意。苏维埃作家们应当从这一事实作出重要的结论来：那便是凡是很差的、受到人民指责的影片，通常无论在思想性或是艺术性方面来说，都是创造得很不好的、没有很大价值的文学电影剧本。在电影剧作部门工作的苏维埃作家，都应当为我们思想意识工作中这一最重要部分事业的现状想到他底责任。
    苏联人民都正在期待着我们的艺术工作者能创造出那样的作品：它们能反映我们美好国家底多方面的生活，能叫人高兴，能呼唤人前进，能激起苏维埃人底美好感情和思想。
    一九五一年，是在苏联人民为不断提高社会主义经济和文化的斗争底旗帜之下过去了。历史上空前未有过的大建设，对大自然的令人惊奇的进攻，提出了一些新的国民经济任务，提拔了不少能实现斯大林同志指示的新人。
    古比雪夫、斯大林格勒、卡霍夫卡等地水电站的建筑，伏尔加——顿，土尔克明，北克里木等几条运河的修建，都说明了苏维埃人在列宁——斯大林党领导之下能做出怎样的非同凡响的丰功伟绩来。充分地描写这些非同凡响的丰功伟绩——是苏维埃作家最高尚的任务之一。在过去这一年，有好多苏维埃作家都以“创作出差”的身份，到过那些共产主义伟大建筑工程的地方去。在报端上也出现过一些描写我们时代底巨大建筑工程的随笔和诗篇。但是还没有出现一篇那样的随笔和诗篇——能真正以其艺术性完整与思想性的深刻来激动读者的；还没有出现一首关于改造自然，关于从事共产主义各项建筑工程的工人、工程师、以及技术家们的卓越的长诗、中篇和长篇小说。高尔基说过，我们的现实是雄伟的，因此他曾号召作家们创造广泛的画面，史诗般的综合性的作品。苏维埃作家还未能实现这位社会主义现实主义伟大的奠基人底遗言。
    不过要是认为苏维埃作家逃避描写工人阶级，那也就错误了。在一九五一年，还是出现了一些描写这个主题的作品，如波里斯·戈尔巴托多底才出版的长篇小说“顿巴斯”第一部，阿夫捷扬科底长篇小说“劳动”，奥丽加·吉乌底长篇小说“忙碌的时光”等作品，就都是描写这个主题的。
    在最近创作的一些描写苏维埃工人阶级的作品中，列宁格勒青年作家科切多夫底那部长篇小说“儒尔宾一家人”可以算是一部出类拔萃的作品。
    不过，尽管在研究工人阶级和集体农庄的农民这一主题方面，在许多写工人和集体农庄庄员的作品这一方面有了些重大的成就，但是都还存在着一个共同的缺点：这些作品表现自己底主人公都只是片面的，只在生产中去表现他们。技术、竞赛、生产计划，常常遮盖住了那些掌握技术、参加竞赛，为完成生产计划而斗争的活人。
    苏维埃人都正在进行着伟大的社会政治工作，学习着，经常到剧院去，和朋友们争辩着生活中一些最重要的问题，考虑着家庭、新道德、以及人类相互关系底一些问题，欢欣着和燃烧着热情，爱着和憎恨着。可是我们的好些作家，却把自己底创作视野，只局限于苏维埃人直接献身于劳动的那一部分时间。对于共同劳动以外的所有的事情，某些作家和批评家则是鄙视的，他们把这些事情叫做“日常生活”，对它根本就不予以注意。好些作家，渐渐从他们主人公底生活兴趣的圈子里把一切与直接生产活动无关的东西都给剥夺了，或是几乎都剥夺了，这么以来，所以那些用工人阶级生活中的材料而创作的作品，也就自然要显得贫乏了。
    “日常生活”底反对者们，把俄罗斯古典文学底一些优良的传统也都给忘了。我们不妨回想一下普希金底那部诗体长篇小说“叶甫盖尼·奥湼金”。诗人是那样真实而深刻地描绘了自己主人公们底各方面的生活和心理，因此柏林斯基称这部作品为
    “俄罗斯生活底百科全书”。我们不妨再回想一下：托尔斯泰和俄罗斯其他古典作家，又都是怎样去描写他们作品中主人公们底多方面的生活的。就是这种描写，才帮助了他们全面地显示了他们同时代人底生活的画面，更加完整地、明晰地刻画了人们底性格。
    应当记住，正确地显示生活，是有助于人们底共产主义教育的。要知道，就是在日常生活中，那些足以妨碍我们前进的、那些该死的过去的残余，那些应当消灭的东西，才会更明显地表现出来。一个作家，应当在他暴露我们日常生活中的那些缺点时，就同时帮助人民前进，帮助他们向共产主义前进。
    当然，注意日常生活，并不就是要我们艺术家在他们作品中摒弃苏维埃人生产活动的描写。要是用另一极端——只描写主人公底日常生活，以代替这一极端——只在生产中去描写劳动者，那么，这种想法也是非常错误的。要想完成一部描写我们同时代人——共产主义建设者底生动的作品，那就必须要做到那样才可以：既在生产中去表现他，又在日常生活中去表现他，也就是说在一个人底全部活动范围之内去表现他；因为社会主义现实主义底基本要求，就是要赋予生活一些真实的、富有历史意义的具体的画面。
    苏维埃作家们，在创造出色的音乐作品这一方面，对于音乐工作者们也帮助得不够。今年只有一个歌剧——爱沙尼亚作曲家卡普底“自由底歌手”——荣获了斯大林奖金二等奖。
    党号召作曲家创造精美的苏维埃歌剧。联共（布）中央委员会在“关于穆拉捷里底歌剧‘伟大的友谊’”的决议中，曾批判了苏维埃音乐中的形式主义化的趋向，这种趋向，事实上是反人民的，并把音乐艺术引向灭亡的道路。近几年来，苏维埃作曲家们是创造了些值得注意的作品。然而，直到今天为止，所有必须从这个决议中做出的结论，还是不曾做出。某些作曲家和歌剧词本底作者把跟形式主义作斗争，理解成就是放弃提高写作技巧、就是指望原始主义和简单化。如被苏维埃舆论所公正指责的儒科夫斯基底那个歌剧“全心全意”，就是那一类很差的，原始性的歌剧。
    这只是那些音乐工作者们底过错吗？当然不是。就如同既然剧院没有有价值的剧本，它便不能够有好戏上演，既然没有合适的电影脚本，也就不可能有动人的影片上演是一样，既然没有好的歌词，当然也就不可能写出真正的歌剧。音乐工作者们，曾多次把共同从事创作面向广大人民大众的雄伟的歌剧这一问题向作家们提出，但作家们目前对于音乐家们的帮助还是不够的。作曲家和作家们，还未能创造出关于我们同时代人的卓越的苏维埃歌剧。
    苏联人民不仅在期待着有价值的、雄伟的音乐作品，而且也在期待着新的、有才能的歌曲。近几年来，苏维埃诗人和作曲家们曾创作了许多好的歌曲，特别是关于争取和平斗争方面的歌曲。但是像那样的歌曲：能使苏维埃人把自己内心的抒情诗一般的柔情、自己底新世界建设者的自豪心，以及自己对祖国的热爱都投入里面去的歌曲，却还没有人写出。倒是在战前和战争时期，却产生了不少那样的歌曲：如“祖国进行曲”、“喀秋莎”、“神圣的战争”、以及其他许多反映着我们卓越人民底思想与渴望的纯正而真挚的苏维埃歌曲。
    ×××
    正在走向共产主义的苏联人民，是迅速地在成长着的。读者和观众对艺术作品的要求，是无比地提高了。一两年以前，能使苏维埃人满足的东西，在今天已不能再满足他们了。他们无论是对艺术作品底思想性的深刻或是艺术技巧，都提出了很大的要求。苏维埃人对于艺术的愿望，不仅只希望它底水平是随着他们底成长而提高，而是希望艺术更能帮助推动我们底人向前进，以便达到人类文化底新的高峰。很多苏维埃文学作品，目前都还未能满足人们这个合理的要求。
    为了完成上述的、向各种不同形式的艺术工作者提出的那些巨大的任务，苏维埃作家都应该去深刻地研究生活，不断地从思想方面提高自己，并不断地娴熟自己底艺术技巧。
    直到今天为止，在某些作家中间，还存在着一种没有根除的腐朽的谬论，在妨碍着苏维埃艺术未来的发展，那种谬论说什么艺术家主要的、唯一的任务，就是寻找好的现代主题并用正确的思想立场把它加以阐明。
    这种“理论”底拥护者，认为艺术技巧——这是次要的事情。他们说，让那些形式主义者去搞艺术技巧去吧。因此某些作家和批评家对于艺术技巧问题，就完全不予以足够的注意了。这一点特别明显地表现在诗底部门。好些诗人底诗篇都很难读，因为这些诗就好像那种公式化了的蹩脚的论文和机关里的报告。在这些诗里，既没有深刻的感情，也没有鲜明的生活体验，更没有叫人永怀不忘的形象。这些诗不能激动读者，倒是只足以引起他们合理的烦恼。
    当然，主题底现时性自有其巨大的意义。真正的苏维埃艺术家，是不能逃避解决那些现代主题的，是不能不站在先进的世界观的立场上去阐明它们的，不然的话，他就一定要破坏生活底真实。但是关于艺术技巧这一问题，可也绝不是次要的问题。是应该明白的时候了——对技巧采取马马虎虎的态度，结果不只是减低作品底艺术水平，而且也必然要减低其思想水平。在艺术方面不成熟的作品，也就是说，像那种里面的形象都是很少富于表情的、结构是混乱的、语言是不讲究的，以及诸如此类情形的作品，无论用什么好的思想，它也还是不能实现作者底企图的，因为这样的作品将不能为读者所接受，它不能为他们打开生活底新的方面，不能在争取共产主义的斗争中对他们有所帮助。艺术是属于人民并为人民服务的。一个马马虎虎去对待艺术技巧问题的作家，那就别去妄想那个人类灵魂工程师，人民作家的崇高称号。而且，他一定也要为人民所抛弃的。难道说对于一个蹩脚的建筑家、一个蹩脚的工程师，能相信他能建筑出一所好房子么？因此，对于一个蹩脚的作家，也就更其不可能相信他可以参加那个“不可见的堡垒”——人民灵魂底堡垒的建筑工作了。
    在苏维埃艺术工作者中间，也还存在着另一个极端：那便是有许多人都还为“革新”这一概念所迷。在这种情形之下，他们对于真正革新的了解，都只是皮相的，把它当作是别的艺术家们还不知道的新手法的本钱呢。这种理论底拥护者们，认为苏维埃艺术每一部新的作品，都一定只能是按照革新的方法的。绝不是任何一个革新活动，就都可以被认作是真正革新的活动的。苏维埃最卓越的艺术家，如高尔基和马雅科夫斯基，都是真实而鲜明地反映革命的斗争和我们人民的新生活，依据着古典艺术的优良传统，而创造了一些出色的作品。这些作品，无论是以其所表现的思想性的深刻，或是艺术技巧的完美，都足以使读者惊心动魄，因为这些作品都是真实地、非常富于才华地在现实底革命的发展中反映了现实，并以共产主义崇高理想的精神帮助教育劳动人民。可是形式主义者们所谓的那种革新，就完全是另一种性质了。这个学派底拥护者，完全不去考虑生活底真实的反映，而只是想用口头上漂亮词儿使读者惊奇。没有问题，任何标奇立异、装腔作势、耍花样，都是离开真正的革新是很远的，这就如同形式主义者们底那些没有思想性的作品离开真正的艺术很远是一样。真正的艺术家，从来就不认为革新是“为革新而革新”。新的东西，只有当它取得了存在的权利的时候，它才应当比旧的好。
    所有苏维埃作家都应该了解：为争取高度的思想性与艺术技巧而斗争，这就是为争取苏维埃文学底人民性、为加强它对于群众的影响而斗争。只有那个能真正表现人民底生活、帮助人民前进的苏维埃作家，才配称人类灵魂的工程师。我们的人民，是不可衡量地成长了。联共（布）中央委员会在“关于电影‘伟大的生活’”的决议中指示说：“党和国家，今后也将培养人民对艺术作品的优良旨趣和严格要求态度的。”
    在苏维埃文学和苏联批评界中，还存在着许多严重的缺点。党和斯大林同志，已把那个跟各种缺点作斗争的不锈的武器——批评与自我批评交到了我们手里。党教导我们：没有批评，任何机构就都要腐化，没有批评，任何病就都会在机构里生根，因之将来也就难以医治。害怕批评的人，就是可耻的懦夫。没有批评，也就没有前进。把那些与文学艺术有关的最重要的创作讨论大力地展开，这样一定会帮助我们的作家和批评家们根除他们工作中那些严重的缺点，并创造出一些为人民所需要的出色的作品。
    必须彻底地去揭露那些文学工作者：他们不是把自己的相互关系拿事业来作基础，而是拿朋友的利益来作基础。联共（布）中央委员会在一九四六年八月十四日的决议中指示说：“这种为保全朋友关系而牺牲人民利益和国家利益、牺牲正确教育我国青年事业的利益、并使批评被压倒下去的自由主义，结果就使作家们再也不求深造，丧失掉自己对人民、对国家、以及对党所应有的责任感，停止前进。”
    毫无疑问，依靠党底锐利的批评，依靠斯大林同志底父亲般的关怀，苏联的艺术工作者一定能在自己底身上找到创作的力量去解决他们当前的那些新的、比较困难的任务。我们大家来回忆一下一九四六年吧，党从来也没有过像当时那样严格地、尖锐地把所有艺术部门的工作者底严重缺点和错误都予以批评。于是艺术工作者们，就从自己身上找到了力量，实事求是地估计了情势，揭露了当时的错误和缺点所以发生的原因。
    党交下了进一步发展苏维埃艺术的大纲。苏维埃文学也以一些重大的、内容丰富的、充满了现代精神的作品报答了党和人民。
    如所周知，戏剧创作是有其特殊的特点。为了要大家能完全接受那个剧本，光是把它像跟小说和诗那样朗诵还是不够的，它还必须在舞台上与大家相见。因此要想获得戏剧创作底成功发展，那就只有在剧作家们和各剧院密切合作的条件之下才能够办得到。近几年来，剧作家们与各剧院之间的联系是非常的不够的；必须用一切的方法去加强这种联系。在这一方面，我们已开始采取重要步骤。但是某些作家却有这么一种想法：认为加强剧作家跟剧院之间的联系，就是将从艺术事业委员会方面取消对他们工作的监督。用这种原始的无政府主义方式来提问题，对于正确地、有成果地去解决苏维埃艺术工作者当前的那些重要的任务，是未必能有所帮助的。
    我们的戏剧创作，在其队伍中有一支由许多有才华的、具有无穷尽的创作力的、经验丰富的苏维埃剧作家所组成的强大的队伍。每年都有日新又新的人走进戏剧创作中来。戏剧界值此自己生活中错综复杂的时期，应该向其他文学式样的作家呼援，以便矫正现代剧院事业底一些缺点。我们有全部的实际材料去答复党底“关于各剧院上演的戏目及其改进办法”的决议底结果，那便是那条由许多新的、有才华的苏维埃剧本所汇成的洪流，这条洪流，是可能保证每一家剧院在一年里头都上演两个——三个用现代的、活跃的主题而写成的思想性是深刻的，艺术性是完美的，非常有才华的剧本的。
    电影部门底落后现象，我们也一定能够肃清。只是需要克服惰性。因为在电影界中是有着善于写作和能够写作的大师们。在电影方面也还有着收集好的整套的出色的电影剧本创作经验的存粮，根据这些存粮，在苏联曾创造了一些壮丽的、以胜利姿态走遍全世界的影片。掌握着这种经验，掌握着这些电影剧本作者干部，靠着引吸有才华的作家以大大地扩充这种干部组织，我们一定能够肃清电影部门中的“弱点”的。
    苏维埃作家们，无论是在戏剧创作方面也好，在电影剧创作方面也好，在歌剧创作方面也好，以及在诗歌创作方面也好，都没有权利落后。他们应当用所有的方法去帮助与他们有密切关系的艺术——如戏剧、电影，以及音乐的发展。
    苏维埃文学，拥有丰富的创作经验。在其所有的式样中，都有一些根据它们性质说来是革新的，走进了新的、社会主义文化底宝库的作品。在苏联所有兄弟国家底文学方面，也都长成了富有才华的文学大师们的巨大队伍。
    依据着巨大的创作经验，因自己底先驱者们——古典作家们——底优良传统而有力量，苏维埃文学工作者，将一定能够而且也应该创造出一些不朽的、高度思想艺术的作品来。
    党已把我们应该走的道路明显地指示了我们。在这条道路上，我们将一定能创造出配得上那些在党底领导之下、按照着列宁和斯大林底天才计划、在我们国家正建设着共产主义的人们的作品。
