    Correcting Our Doctors' Pathological Viewpoints
    ——From the Role of Language to the Ideological Remolding of Medical Workers
    Liu Minying

    When we are unhappy, we lose our appetite and cannot eat; when our minds are too active at night, we cannot sleep; when we are emotionally agitated or terrified, we experience rapid heartbeats.

    When a person has a disease, their "psychology" and "emotions" will inevitably change to some extent. Especially when a person suffers from a so-called chronic disease or a disease for which there is currently no good treatment, the changes in their "psychology" and "emotions" are more serious than the pathological changes, such as not being able to eat, not being able to sleep, worrying all day long, and believing that an unfortunate or painful future awaits them. In this case, the pathological process develops towards this future. Doctors are more familiar with this point.

    What do the above issues illustrate? It shows that changes in our "psychology" and "emotions" have a profound impact on the physiological or pathological functions of our internal organs, even causing pathological morphological changes in the internal organs. This shows that there are two factors that provoke the entire pathological process: first, pathological factors belonging to the natural world, such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, which are sufficient to directly cause disease, but their pathogenic effects are often manifested locally. Second, there is the factor of human society, a factor that we come into contact with countless times every day and yet do not pay attention to: the factor of language, because language is the basis and source of our human "psychological" and "emotional" activities. This factor affects the functional activities of our whole body through the brain, and of course, indirectly and seemingly imperceptibly, affects the local pain.

    Why do we say that our human "psychology" and "emotions" are based on and derived from language? We all know that our human "psychological" and "emotional" activities are different from those of animals. The "psychology" and "emotions" of animals are the activities of the first signal system of the brain, while human "psychological" and "emotional" activities are the activities of the second signal system unique to humans, namely the language system. Stalin clearly described this issue in his brilliant essay "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics." He said: "Whatever thoughts may arise in the human mind, whenever these thoughts occur, they can only occur and exist in the substance of language, on the basis of the words and sentences of language. Naked thought, independent of the substance of language, independent of the 'endowed matter' of language, is absolutely non-existent." The great Russian biologist Sechenov also pointed out: It is precisely because of language that abstract thinking has obtained its physiological basis.

    Pavlov had already provided a brilliant description and analysis of the position of the second signal in the body. One of the most important propositions of Pavlov's higher nervous system theory is that "the higher part of the central nervous system governs all phenomena occurring in the human body." What does the so-called higher part of the human central nervous system refer to? It refers to the second signal system of the two hemispheres of the brain. Pavlov pointed out: "Ultimately, all complex relationships in the human body have been transformed into the second signal system… The human second signal system influences the first signal system and also influences the subcortical layer." "The particularly important role of regulating subcortical activity is attributed to the higher part of the cerebral hemisphere - the second signal system. In a normal person, the second signal system is the highest regulator of human behavior." Pavlov believed: "The second signal system is the last acquisition in the evolutionary process."

    Since the second signal system occupies such an important position in physiological or pathological activities, and at the same time, we often see the reflection of this theory in clinical practice, have our doctors paid attention to the second signal system, that is, the linguistic thinking system, when treating patients? I think many doctors pay little attention to this point or do not pay attention to it at all. In clinical practice, our doctors only focus on investigating or trying to relieve the narrow pathological changes of the patient, and do not pay attention to investigating or relieving the broad pathological changes, including psychological ones. This leads us to particularly emphasize drug and physical therapies in treatment, while neglecting to use language and the activities of the patient's linguistic thinking system to help us treat the disease. That is to say, we do not use various forms of psychotherapy. Some doctors have a bad attitude towards patients, or do not educate patients well to correct their wrong views on their diseases, which makes patients feel discouraged, suffers a great psychological trauma, affects the improvement of the disease, and promotes the deterioration of the disease. Some tuberculosis experts or doctors believe that tuberculosis is a chronic disease and will not change much in a short period of time, so they advocate checking the ward once a week. They believe that this proposition is based on a correct pathological view. The Soviet Union calls doctors who hold this style and view "doctors who treat diseases," not doctors who treat patients.

    Why do our doctors have such shortcomings or mistakes? I think the reason is that we are still seriously influenced by the old cellular pathology in our thinking, and we have not regarded people as a whole, nor have we clearly distinguished the human view of disease from the animal view of disease, that is to say, we have not paid attention to absorbing Pavlov's advanced medical ideas. Today, we should realize that our previous pathological views were extremely narrow. Although it was a little better than the method of treating a headache by treating the head and treating a foot pain by treating the foot, it basically did not transcend that range of thought. Therefore, a major topic is put forward in front of our doctors: to study Marxism-Leninism and absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This is of great importance to the development of the medical and health undertakings of New China and the improvement of medical science and health personnel.

    端正我们医生的病理观点
    ——从语言的作用谈到医务工作者的思想改造问题
    刘民英
    当我们心里不高兴时，就发生胃口不好，吃不下饭的现象；夜间我们的思想活动得过于紧张时，就睡不着觉；当我们情绪激动或恐怖时，就发生心跳加速等现象。
    一个人有了一种病，他的“心理”、“情绪”必然要或多或少地发生变化。特别是当一个人得了所谓慢性病或现在没有什么好办法可以治疗的病时，他的“心理”、“情绪”的变化要比他的病理变化严重得多，例如吃不下饭，睡不着觉，整天发愁，以为不幸的或痛苦的前途正等待着他。在这种情况下，病理过程也就向这个前途发展了。对于这一点，医生是更为熟悉的。
    上述的问题说明了什么呢？它说明了我们人的“心理”、“情绪”的变化，对我们人的内脏生理的或病理的机能活动都有着深刻的影响，甚至使内脏发生病理形态学上的变化。由此说明，惹起整个病理过程的有两种因素：第一是细菌、原虫、病毒等属于自然界的病理因素，它足以直接引起疾病，但其致病作用往往表现在局部。第二是人类社会的因素，是一种我们每天无数次地接触着而又使我们不留意的因素，即语言的因素，因为语言是我们人类“心理”、“情绪”活动的基础和来源。这种因素通过大脑，影响我们全身的机能活动，当然也间接地、似乎不很明显地影响着病痛的局部。
    为什么说我们人类的“心理”、“情绪”是以语言为基础和来源呢？我们都知道，我们人的“心理”、“情绪”活动是和动物的“心理”、“情绪”活动不一样的，动物的“心理”、“情绪”是大脑的第一信号系统的活动，人的“心理”、“情绪”活动是人类独有的第二信号系统即语言系统的活动。斯大林在其天才的论文“论语言学的几个问题”中曾清楚地对这一问题作了叙述。他说：“无论在人的头脑中，发生了什么样的思想，无论这些思想发生在什么时候，它们总只能发生于、存在于语言的实质上，语言的词和句的基础上。赤裸裸的思想，离语言的实质而独立，离语言的‘天赋的物质’而独立，这是绝不存在的。”俄国大生物学家谢巧诺夫也指出过：正因为有了语言，抽象的思惟才得到了它的生理基础。
    人的头脑中的第二信号在机体中的地位，巴甫洛夫早已有了精辟的叙述和分析。巴甫洛夫的高级神经学说，最主要的命题之一是“中央神经系统的高级部分，统理人体发生的一切现象。”所谓人的中央神经系统的高级部分是指的什么东西呢？是指的大脑两半球的第二信号系统。巴甫洛夫指出：“归根结柢，人体中的一切复杂关系，都已经转变为第二信号系统了。……人的第二信号系统，影响着第一信号系统，同时也影响着皮质下层。”“调节皮质下层活动的特别重要作用，是归之于大脑半球高级部分——第二信号系统的。在一个正常的人身上，第二信号系统，是人类行为的最高节制者。”巴甫洛夫认为：“第二信号系统是进化过程中的最后获得物。”
    既然第二信号系统在生理活动或病理活动的过程中占有如此重要的地位，同时，我们在临床实践中也常见到这种理论的反映，那么，我们医生们在给病人治病时是否注意到了第二信号系统即语言性思惟系统呢？我想，有许多医生是很少注意到或根本没有注意到这一点的。我们医生在临床时，只是着重探查或设法解除患者的狭义的病理变化，不注意探查或解除患者的广义的即包括心理的病理变化。这样就使我们在治疗时特别强调药物的、物理的疗法，而忽视通过语言，通过患者的语言性思维系统的活动去帮助我们治病。也就是说，没有运用各种形式的精神疗法。有的医生对病人的态度不好，或者没有很好地教育患者，端正他对自己疾病的错误看法，这就使病人灰心丧气，心理上受到很大创伤，影响了疾病的好转，促使了疾病的恶化。有些结核专家或医生，认为结核是慢性病，短时间不会有什么变化，因此主张一星期查病房一次。他们认为这种主张是基于正确的病理学的观点之上的。苏联把持有这种作风和观点的医生称为“治病的医生”，不是治病人的医生。
    我们医生为什么发生这样的缺点或错误呢？我想，其原因在于我们在思想上还严重地受着旧细胞病理学的影响，没有把人看成是一个整体，更没有把人的疾病观与动物的疾病观明确区分开来，那就是说，我们还没有重视吸取巴甫洛夫的先进医学思想。今天我们应该认识到，我们以前的病理观点是极其狭隘的，它虽比头痛医头、脚痛医脚的方法高明了一些，但基本上还没有超越那个思想范围。于是在我们医生面前提出了一个重大的课题：学习马克思列宁主义，吸取苏联的先进经验。这对于新中国医药卫生事业的发展和医药科学卫生人员的提高有着重大的关系。
