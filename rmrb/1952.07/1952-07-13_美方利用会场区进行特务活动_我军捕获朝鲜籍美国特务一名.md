Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 12th: The U.S. side's sabotage of the neutral zone agreement and the use of the Panmunjom conference area for espionage activities has once again been clearly proven. On July 8th, our army captured a Korean American special agent named Luo Chunhua who had crossed the Panmunjom conference area and infiltrated our area to collect military intelligence. He was dispatched by U.S. special service organs from the U.S. position, via the Panmunjom conference area, to infiltrate our area at around 6:00 AM on the 8th. He was captured by our army on the same day. The U.S. side has in the past repeatedly and openly used the neutral zone, where both sides agreed to cease all hostile acts, to conduct espionage activities constituting serious hostile acts, and has recently done so even more blatantly. Just ten days before this incident, on June 28th, two Korean American special agents brazenly returned to the U.S. position through the Panmunjom conference area under the protection of U.S. military police. The U.S. side should bear serious responsibility for these provocative actions that intentionally undermine the agreement.

    美方利用会场区进行特务活动
    我军捕获朝鲜籍美国特务一名
    【新华社开城十二日电】美方破坏中立区协议，利用板门店会场区进行特务活动又一次得到明证。七月八日，我军捕获越过板门店会场区、潜入我区收集军事情报的朝鲜籍美国特务一名。这个特务名叫罗春化。八日上午六时左右，他被美方特务机关派遣，自美方阵地经板门店会场区潜入我区。当日即被我军捕获。美方过去曾经多次公开利用双方协议停止一切敌对行为的中立区，进行构成严重敌对行为的特务活动，最近更明目张胆的这样做。就在这一事件的十天以前，即六月二十八日，两名朝鲜籍美国特务曾公然在美方军事警察的庇护下，通过板门店会场区，回到了美方阵地。美方对这些有意破坏协议的挑衅行为，应负严重的责任。
