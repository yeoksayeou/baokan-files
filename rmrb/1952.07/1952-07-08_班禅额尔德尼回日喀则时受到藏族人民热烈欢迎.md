Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th: Panchen Erdene and over 500 monks and lay officials from the Kampo Assembly Hall arrived in Xigaze, the capital of Rear Tibet, on June 23rd. Before Panchen Erdene arrived in Xigaze, the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan local government ordered the Xigaze Jizong (equivalent to the Commissioner's Office) government to cooperate with the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery Lazhik (the highest administrative organ within Panchen Erdene's government) to organize a preparatory committee. The political staff of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xigaze also actively assisted in the preparatory work.

On the 23rd, thousands of red flags fluttered in Xigaze. Citizens displayed various flowers in front of their doors, and slogans written in Tibetan and Chinese characters, such as "Support the unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdene to build a new Tibet," were posted at major intersections. The welcoming procession stretched for several miles from the Nyang River in the east of the city to Zhaxilhunbu Monastery. Tibetans wore earrings and gemstones, young people wore Chairman Mao badges on their chests, and women were adorned with flowers. As Panchen Erdene passed through the welcoming crowd, people sang and danced to their hearts' content, expressing their inner joy.

Panchen Erdene stated that in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, he would unite closely with the Dalai Lama, take practical actions to implement the agreement, help the People's Liberation Army overcome difficulties, completely expel imperialist forces, and consolidate the southwest national defense.

    班禅额尔德尼回日喀则时受到藏族人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社拉萨七日电】班禅额尔德尼及堪布会议厅僧俗官员等五百多人于六月二十三日抵达后藏首府日喀则。在班禅额尔德尼尚未到达日喀则以前，达赖喇嘛和西藏地方政府就命令日喀则机宗（相当于专员公署）政府协同札什伦布寺拉稷（班禅额尔德尼行辕内的最高行政机关）组织了筹备委员会。人民解放军驻日喀则部队的政治工作人员也积极协助筹备工作。
    二十三日，日喀则飘扬着成千面红旗，市民们在门前陈列着各种鲜花，各大街的路口贴着用藏汉文字写的“拥护达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼团结起来建设新西藏”的标语，欢迎行列从市东年楚河到札什伦布寺，长达数里，藏民们佩戴着耳环、宝石，青年们在胸前挂着毛主席像，妇女们也满戴鲜花。当班禅额尔德尼通过欢迎行列时，人们都尽情地歌唱和舞蹈，表现出他们内心的欢欣。
    班禅额尔德尼表示今后一定要在中央人民政府毛主席领导下，与达赖喇嘛亲密团结，以实际行动来执行协议，帮助人民解放军克服困难，彻底驱逐帝国主义势力，巩固祖国西南国防。
