Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 2nd: The US side, which has consistently undermined the neutral zone agreement in various ways, is openly using the Panmunjom conference area for its espionage activities. On June 28th, two Korean American agents, under the open protection of US military police, passed through the Panmunjom conference area and US military sentry posts, returning to the US side's positions.

It is not the first time that the US side has used the neutral zone agreement, which provides for the cessation of all hostile acts, to conduct espionage activities that constitute serious hostile acts. The Kim Won-ki incident, which occurred last October, is a well-known example. Kim Won-ki, an eleven-year-old Korean child, under the instruction and enticement of the US forces, sneaked into the Kaesong neutral zone for reconnaissance and was apprehended by our side. After pointing out that the US side should guarantee that it would no longer entice children to sneak into the neutral zone for espionage activities, our side handed Kim Won-ki over to the US side for return home. In the presence of liaison officers and reporters from both sides, this innocent child described how, under the enticement and instruction of the US forces, he was brought into the neutral zone by personnel from the US armistice negotiation delegation and left behind to carry out espionage activities.

The incident on June 28th, in which US agents used the conference area to sneak back to the US side, is another proof of the US side's use of the conference area for espionage activities. But in order to cover up its blatant violation of the agreement, the US side fabricated a story, saying that the two agents "waving white flags" ran through the Panmunjom conference area, jointly guarded by both sides, to "surrender" to them. This ostrich-like trick cannot absolve the US side of the responsibility for this provocative act that violates the agreement once again.

### 美方破坏协议利用会场区进行特务活动

    美方破坏协议利用会场区进行特务活动
    【新华社开城二日电】一贯以各种方式破坏中立区协议的美方，竟公开利用板门店会场区进行他们的特务活动。六月二十八日，两名朝鲜籍美国特务，公然在美方军事警察的庇护下，通过板门店会场区，通过美军岗哨，回到美方阵地。
    美方利用双方关于停止一切敌对行为的中立区协议，进行构成严重敌对行为的特务活动，这已不是第一次。去年十月发生的金元基事件，就是一个为人熟知的例子。十一岁的朝鲜儿童金元基，在美方部队的指使及诱骗下，潜入开城中立区进行侦察，被我方发觉扣留。我方在指出美方应保证不再诱使儿童潜入中立区进行特务活动后，将金元基交给美方转送回家。这个无辜的儿童，当着双方联络官及双方记者多人，陈述了他在美方部队的诱骗和指使下，由美方停战谈判代表团人员携入中立区，潜留进行特务活动的经过。
    六月二十八日美国特务利用会场区潜回美方地区的事件，是美方利用会场区进行特务活动的又一明证。但为了遮盖其悍然违反协议的行为，美方竟凭空捏造，说这两名特务“摇着白旗”跑过双方共同警戒的板门店会场区，去向他们“投降”。这种掩耳盗铃的伎俩，绝不能解脱美方对这又一次违反协议的挑衅行为应负的责任。
