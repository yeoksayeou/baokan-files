Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 13th: Northeast China's rural areas will launch a large-scale manure collection campaign during the slack farming season, making manure collection the central focus of the patriotic production increase competition.

In recent years, manure collection and application have increased annually in Northeast China's rural areas. In 1949, the area fertilized accounted for only 44.7 percent of the cultivated land, but this year it has increased to 65 percent. Many advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have created new high-yield records by applying more fertilizer and applying it rationally. However, manure collection work in the Northeast region still has serious shortcomings. First, a large amount of human and animal waste has not been utilized. It is estimated that if the region's human and animal waste is fully utilized, 160 million tons can be collected annually; calculating 12 tons per hectare (15 mu), 80 percent of the region's cultivated land can be fully fertilized. However, many areas still lack toilets for people, pens for pigs, and sheds for horses. In particular, some farmers in the central and northern regions do not have the habit of collecting human waste, resulting in about 40 percent of the region's land not being fertilized. Second, manure collection methods are unscientific. Farmers are accustomed to spreading livestock manure flat on the ground, which causes severe nitrogen loss due to wind and sun exposure. Farmers in many areas also do not know how to compost manure, and the yellow manure sent to the fields is mixed with a large amount of unfermented raw manure, which is an important cause of diseases, pests, and weeds. Third, the leadership of governments at all levels in manure collection work still suffers from varying degrees of formalism and bureaucratic style. There are generally many calls but a lack of concrete organizational work, and they are satisfied with the figures in the reports from various levels. As a result, the annual manure collection plans formulated by the provinces cannot be implemented.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government held a regional fertilizer work conference in mid-June, which determined that this year's manure collection policy is to implement a mass-based, year-round manure collection policy, fundamentally improve manure collection methods, and open up manure sources from various aspects. The Agricultural Department requires that the average amount of fertilizer applied in the region next year be increased by 50 percent compared to this year, with Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces increasing by 60 percent, Jilin Province by 50 percent, and Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Rehe provinces by 30 percent. In terms of quality, it is required to thoroughly ferment and decompose the manure, increase the proportion of manure in the fertilizer, and gradually change the phenomenon of having more soil than manure in the fertilizer. To this end, it was decided to launch a large-scale mass manure collection campaign during the slack farming season this year, to collect more than two-thirds of the total amount of fertilizer applied throughout the year. In terms of opening up manure sources, the first step is to ensure that cattle and horses have sheds and pigs have pens. Rural areas in the central and northern regions should build horse sheds and pig pens during the slack farming season, and ensure frequent bedding. Secondly, toilets and outhouses should be built universally. In areas of Liaoxi and Liaodong with a better foundation for manure collection work, the construction of brick latrines or the use of jars to collect human urine should also be promoted. At the same time, the organization of urban manure to the countryside should be organized. In areas with composting conditions, farmers should be organized to cut green seedlings and apply green manure. In wheat-producing areas, farmers are encouraged to use wheat straw or all agricultural waste to make compost. Agricultural experiment stations in various provinces should propagate "Zha Zha bacteria" in large quantities to further promote the "Zha Zha bacteria" manure-making method. Manure collection methods should also be thoroughly improved to improve the quality of manure.

In order to strengthen the leadership of manure collection work, agricultural departments in various provinces and counties have successively held meetings, corrected the erroneous idea that "manure collection work is a simple matter and does not require leadership," formulated manure collection work plans, and will soon organize a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda and education to dispel the conservative ideas among farmers such as "one fertilization every three years is enough," and mobilize farmers to quickly formulate manure collection plans, with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as the core to launch manure collection competitions. Governments at all levels also plan to adopt the method of grasping key points at each level, providing specific guidance, and promoting good experiences in a timely manner to mobilize all farmers to participate in the manure collection movement. In carrying out the manure collection competition, timely evaluation and inspection should also be carried out, and finally, manure collection models should be selected and awarded. State-owned farms, agricultural experiment stations, demonstration farms, and agricultural technology extension stations in various places should closely combine manure collection activities to provide technical guidance to farmers.

### 东北农村即将展开大规模群众性积肥运动

    东北农村即将展开大规模群众性积肥运动
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北农村即将在挂锄期间展开大规模积肥运动，以积肥工作作为爱国增产竞赛运动的中心。
    几年来，东北农村积肥、施肥每年都有增加。一九四九年，施肥面积仅占耕地的百分之四十四点七，今年已增到百分之六十五。许多先进的农业生产合作社、互助组由于做到多施肥和合理施肥，因而创造了高额产量的新纪录。但是东北区的积肥工作还存在着严重的缺点。第一、大量的人畜粪尿还未被利用。据估计，如果充分利用全区的人畜粪尿，每年可积攒一亿六千万吨；按每垧（合十五市亩）上十二吨计算，全区百分之八十的耕地上可以上满粪。但是，许多地区还是人缺厕所，猪无圈、马无棚；特别是中部、北部地区的部分农民还没有积攒人粪尿的习惯，以致全区仍有百分之四十左右的土地未能施肥。第二、积肥方法不科学。农民惯于把牲畜粪平地铺开，粪肥遭受风吹日晒，氮肥损失极大；许多地区的农民还不会沤粪，往地里送的黄粪里夹杂着大量尚未发酵的生粪，这是发生病、虫害和滋生杂草的重要原因之一。第三、各级人民政府对积肥工作的领导，还有程度不同的形式主义和官僚主义作风，一般号召多，缺乏具体组织工作，满足于层层表报的数字。因而各省订的常年积肥计划不能贯彻。
    为了克服上述缺点，东北人民政府农业部在六月中旬召开了全区肥料工作会议，确定今年的积肥方针是：贯彻群众性的常年积肥方针，根本改善积肥方法，从多方面开辟粪源。农业部要求全区明年施肥数量平均比今年提高百分之五十，其中黑龙江、松江二省施肥量要比今年增加百分之六十，吉林省增加百分之五十，辽西、辽东、热河三省都要增加百分之三十。在质量上，要求彻底做到发酵腐熟，并提高粪肥的比重，逐步改变粪肥中土多粪少的现象。为此，决定今年挂锄期间展开一个大规模的群众性积肥运动，要积攒出全年施肥总量的三分之二以上。在开辟粪源方面，首先要做到牛马有棚、猪有圈。中部、北部农村要在挂锄期内修盖马棚、猪圈，并做到勤起勤垫。其次，要普遍修建厕所和茅坑，在辽西、辽东部分积肥工作基础较好的地区，还要提倡修盖砖便池，或用缸积攒人尿。同时要组织城粪下乡。在有沤肥条件的地区，要组织农民割青棵子压绿肥。在麦产区提倡农民用麦秸或一切农作废弃物做堆肥。各省农业试验场要大量繁殖“扎扎菌”，进一步推广“扎扎菌”造粪法。积肥方法也要彻底改善，以提高粪肥质量。
    为了加强积肥工作的领导，各省、县农业部门已相继召开会议，纠正了“积肥工作是简单事，不用领导”的错误思想，订出积肥工作计划，即将组织大批干部，深入农村，向农民进行宣传教育，以打消农民中存在的“三年一槎粪，攒点就够用”等保守思想，发动农民迅速制订积肥计划，以农业生产合作社、互助组为核心展开积肥竞赛。各级人民政府并拟采取逐级掌握重点、进行具体指导、及时推广好经验的方法，发动所有农民参加到积肥运动中来。在开展积肥竞赛中，还要做到及时评比和检查，最后选出积肥模范，给予奖励。各地国营农场、农业试验场、示范农场和农业技术推广站要密切结合积肥运动，向农民进行技术指导。
