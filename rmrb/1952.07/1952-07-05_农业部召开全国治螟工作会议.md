    To exchange and summarize national rice borer control experiences and plan for the complete eradication of rice borer infestations in the coming years, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a National Rice Borer Control Conference in Hangzhou from June 15th to 25th. Attending the conference were 96 people in total, including professional cadres for pest and disease control from the agricultural and forestry departments of the East China, Central South, and Southwest Administrative Regions, which are rice-growing areas severely affected by rice borers, as well as from twelve provinces and regions including Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Henan, West Sichuan, South Sichuan, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu, agricultural extension team cadres, experts, and professors. Soviet expert, Comrade Miftakhov, was also invited to participate in the conference.
    In the past, rice-growing areas across the country suffered from rice borer infestations every year. In severe years, the loss of rice due to rice borers was at least 10 billion catties or more. In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, people in various regions have launched timely rice borer control campaigns and resolutely fought against rice borer infestations, achieving significant results, and rice borer infestations have been significantly reduced. In Jiangxi Province, before liberation, the annual loss of rice due to rice borers reached more than 15% of the annual output; last year, in areas where the "three cultivations" and "three clearings" were thoroughly implemented, it had been reduced to 1%. The rice borer infestation rate was reduced by more than 86% compared to 1950. In Zhejiang Province, in the rice borer control campaigns of the past two years since liberation, the loss of grain reduced amounted to more than 1 billion catties. Experience in various regions has proven that the primary key to the rice borer control campaign lies in the determination of the leadership. Therefore, in leading the rice borer control campaign, various regions have established specialized pest control organizations and convened rice borer control conferences at all levels; many commissioners, county heads, and responsible cadres of local CCP organizations have led the masses to the fields to control rice borers. For example, in the rice borer control campaign launched in Zhejiang Province in 1950, responsible cadres such as members of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CCP and the Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also personally went to various regions to deploy rice borer control work and urge party and government leading organs at all levels to deeply carry out the rice borer control campaign. In the past two years, Zhejiang Province has mobilized more than 13.6 million people to participate in rice borer control.
    In the rice borer control work, various regions have used various meetings and various propaganda tools to widely conduct rice borer control propaganda to farmers, and have used local examples of rice borer control to educate farmers. Many provinces and regions have printed a large number of colored pest control pictures, pest control manuals, and physical specimens, etc., and distributed them to rural areas. Provinces and regions such as Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu have also held farmer pest control training classes, seminars, and exhibitions; some provinces and regions have created a large number of rice borer control slides and shown them in rural areas. Through these efforts, farmers have understood the laws of rice borer occurrence, living habits, and scientific knowledge of prevention and control techniques, broken the past superstitious ideas about rice borer disasters, and established the confidence of "man will conquer nature" in controlling rice borers. In many areas, farmers have incorporated the prevention and control of rice borer pests into patriotic increase production plans or patriotic covenants, and have carried out division of labor in mutual aid teams, contracted areas, and launched pest control competitions.
    However, in the past rice borer control campaigns, due to the failure to implement the principle of "prevention is more important than cure," insufficient research was done on improving prevention and control methods, and efforts were also evenly distributed during the rice borer control season. As a result, although a lot of manpower and financial resources were spent, the results were not great. At present, how to master the correct prevention and control methods has become a problem that cadres and the vast number of farmers urgently need to solve. In addition to focusing on discussing this issue, the conference also put forward the requirement to strive to eliminate rice borers in a few years based on research reports such as the practical experience of the cadres present and the theoretical knowledge of experts and professors. The conference believes that the effective methods for eliminating rice borer disasters in the future are: destroying rice roots in winter to eliminate overwintering rice stem borer larvae. According to the growth of rice borer moths and the different regional conditions, various regions can adopt rice borer control in seedling fields, or when rice borer moths are in full bloom before rice heading in autumn, use methods such as collecting eggs and catching moths, lighting lamps to attract moths, and inserting smoke stalks to extinguish rice borers. Regarding the future rice borer control work, the conference unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen planning and strengthen organizational leadership and publicity and education work, so that the work of eliminating rice borers can be carried out step by step, with goals, from point to area, from stable to fast, and adapted to local conditions. In order to ensure that the rice borer control work can be done well, various regions must also hold technical training classes for grassroots backbones and establish systems such as inspection, evaluation, and summary. The conference also emphasized the importance of research and experimentation, and suggested conducting experimental research on changing the rice cultivation system in Southern Jiangsu; and establishing field laboratories in the Taihu Lake Basin in East China, the Pearl River Basin in Central South China, and the Chengdu Plain in Southwest China.
    During the conference, Soviet expert Comrade Miftakhov gave a report on the Soviet experience in preventing and controlling pests and diseases. He said that many measures for preventing and controlling pests and diseases in the Soviet Union have always implemented the principle of "prevention is more important than cure," such as increasing the resistance of crops, changing the growing season of crops, and using chemical pest control. The conference unanimously agreed that these experiences will also be the direction of development of rice borer control work in our country.

    农业部召开全国治螟工作会议
    【新华社杭州四日电】为交流和总结全国治螟经验，计划在今后数年内彻底消灭螟灾，中央人民政府农业部于六月十五日到二十五日在杭州召开了全国治螟工作会议。出席这次会议的有全国遭受螟害的水稻区域华东、中南、西南三个大行政区和江西、浙江、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、河南、川西、川南、苏北、苏南等十二个省区农林部门的防治病虫害专业干部、农业推广队干部，以及专家、教授等共九十六人。苏联专家米夫塔霍夫也应邀参加了会议。
    全国各水稻地区过去每年都要遭受螟虫的灾害，严重年份，因螟灾而损失的稻谷至少在一百亿斤以上。解放以后三年来，各地人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下，及时展开治螟运动、坚决和螟害作斗争已获得巨大成绩，螟害已显著减轻。江西省在解放前每年因螟灾损失的稻谷，达年产量百分之十五以上；去年在执行“三耕”、“三光”较彻底的地区已降为百分之一。螟害率比一九五零年减轻了百分之八十六以上。浙江省在解放后两年来的治螟运动中，减少螟害损失的粮米有十亿斤以上。各地经验证明：治螟运动的首要关键在于领导的决心，因此各地在领导治螟运动时，曾建立了专业性的治虫机构，召开了各级治螟会议；不少专员、县长及中共地方组织的负责干部都带领群众下田治虫。如浙江省在一九五零年开展的治螟运动中，中共浙江省委会委员以及省人民政府农林厅厅长等负责干部也亲自到各专区布置治螟工作，督促各级党政领导机关深入开展治螟运动。两年来浙江省曾发动一千三百六十多万人参加了治螟。
    治螟工作中，各地曾运用各种会议和各种宣传工具向农民广泛地进行治螟宣传，采用当地防治螟害的实例向农民进行教育。有许多省、区印制了大量的彩色治虫图、治虫手册和实物标本等发到农村。浙江、苏南等省、区还举办了农民治虫训练班、讲习会和展览会；有些省、区绘制了大量的治螟幻灯片深入农村放映。通过这些工作，使农民懂得了螟虫发生的规律、生活习性和防治技术等科学知识，打破了过去对螟灾的迷信思想，树立起“人定胜天”的治螟信心。很多地区的农民把防治螟虫害订入了爱国增产计划或爱国公约，以互助组为单位进行分工，分片包干，展开治虫竞赛。
    但过去在治螟运动中，由于没有贯彻“防重于治”的方针，对改进防治方法研究不够，在治螟季节上也是平均使用力量，因而人力财力虽化得很多，但收效却不大。目前对如何掌握正确的防治方法已成为干部和广大农民迫切要求解决的问题。会议除着重讨论这一问题外，并根据到会干部的实际经验和专家教授的理论知识等研究报告，提出争取在数年内消灭螟虫的要求。会议认为今后消灭螟灾的有效方法是：冬季毁灭稻根，消灭潜伏过冬的三化螟幼虫。根据螟蛾的成长和地区条件的不同，各地可采用秧田治螟，或在秋季稻子抽穗前螟蛾盛发时，采用采卵捕蛾、点灯诱螟、插烟茎等方法扑灭螟虫。对今后治螟工作，会上一致认为应加强计划性和加强组织领导及宣传教育工作，使消灭螟虫工作有步骤、有目标地由点到面，由稳到快，因地制宜的展开。为保证能做好治螟工作，各地还须举办基层骨干的技术训练班，建立检查评比和总结等制度。会议上还强调重视研究和试验工作，建议在苏南进行改变水稻栽培制度的试验研究；在华东的太湖流域、中南的珠江流域、西南的成都平原三处设立田野实验室。
    会议中，苏联专家米夫塔霍夫作了苏联防治病虫害经验的报告。他说：苏联许多防治病虫害的措施都是始终贯彻“防重于治”的方针，如增加农作物的抵抗力、改变农作物的生长期、以及药剂治虫等。会上一致认为这些经验也将是我国治螟工作的发展方向。
