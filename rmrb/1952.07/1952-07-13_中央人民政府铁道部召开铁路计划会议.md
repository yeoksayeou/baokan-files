The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a national railway planning conference from June 16th to 26th. The main topics discussed at the conference were the 1952 railway production and financial plan, the national railway organizational structure, and how to further promote the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. Minister Teng Daiyuan summarized the railway work of 1951 at the meeting and put forward this year's work tasks.

The current basic situation of the People's Railways is that the democratic reform work has been basically completed, and the entire railway system has entered a stage centered on production reform. The general policy for national railway work this year is to continue to support the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, fully mobilize the masses on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, deeply implement the increase production and practice economy movement, overcome the "three evils," strengthen planned management, thoroughly inspect and vigorously promote advanced working methods, and continue to promote economic accounting systems to achieve improved quality, reduced costs, and increased profits, in preparation for larger-scale railway construction work nationwide. This year's freight transport task has increased by 25.5 percent compared to last year, and the passenger transport task has increased by 3.1 percent. In terms of railway infrastructure construction, the plan strives to save 20 percent of the state's investment.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement is the driving force for promoting railway production reform and an important method for ensuring the completion of transportation tasks. The movement has now been widely carried out in railways across the country. The shortcomings in the development of the movement are the lack of thorough ideological preparation and organizational preparation, especially technical preparation, on the part of the leadership. Therefore, the meeting decided to strengthen leadership over the movement and formulated specific measures and plans for organizational and technical guidance.

The meeting discussed and approved a new railway organizational structure plan. The new plan was formulated by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which will enable appropriate centralization and unification of railway management. After the implementation of the new plan, the economic accounting system can be better implemented, national railway technicians can be rationally used, leading cadres can specifically engage in transportation work, deeply study business, improve and fully utilize railway equipment, so as to fully exploit transportation capacity.

    中央人民政府铁道部召开铁路计划会议
    中央人民政府铁道部在六月十六日至二十六日召开全国铁路计划会议。这次会议主要讨论了一九五二年铁路生产财务计划、全国铁路组织机构和如何进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动等问题。滕代远部长在会上总结了一九五一年的铁路工作和提出今年的工作任务。
    目前人民铁路的基本情况是：民主改革工作基本完成，全路即进入以生产改革为中心的阶段。今年全国铁路工作的总方针是继续支持抗美援朝，在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，充分发动群众，深入贯彻增产节约运动，克服“三害”，加强计划管理，深入检查和大力推行先进工作方法，继续推行经济核算制，达到提高质量、降低成本、增加利润，以准备全国更大规模的铁路建设工作。今年的货物运输任务比去年增加了百分之二十五点五，旅客运输任务增加了百分之三点一。铁路的基本建设方面计划争取节约百分之二十的国家投资。
    会议一致认为满载、超轴、五百公里运动是推动铁路生产改革的动力，也是保证完成运输任务的重要方法。目前运动已在全国铁路普遍开展。运动发展中的缺点是领导上缺乏周密的思想准备、组织准备，特别是技术准备。因此会议确定加强对运动的领导，并订出了组织和技术指导方面的具体措施计划。
    会议讨论并通过了新的铁路组织机构方案。新方案是学习苏联的先进经验制订的，它将使铁路管理适当集中和统一。实行新方案后，经济核算制可以更好地得到贯彻，全国铁路技术人员可以得到合理使用，领导干部可以具体从事运输工作，深刻地研究业务，改善和充分运用铁路设备，以充分发挥运输能力。    （新华社）
