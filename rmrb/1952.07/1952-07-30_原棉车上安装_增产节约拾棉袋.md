    Installing "Increase Production and Save Cotton Collection Bags" on Raw Cotton Carts

    Editor: The State-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's warehouse workshop used to have a serious problem with raw cotton waste. This workshop transports over 100,000 jin of raw cotton to the opening and cleaning workshop every day. Some of it is from broken bales and loose cotton. A lot of this cotton would fall on the ground, and in the past, no one cared. Worker Zhang Fuwu saw this waste and suggested installing "Increase Production and Save Cotton Collection Bags" on the raw cotton carts. After implementing this suggestion, every employee immediately picks up any cotton they see on the ground and throws it into the cotton collection bag. On average, more than 300 jin of raw cotton can be saved each month. Throughout the year, it can accumulate wealth equivalent to 40,000 jin of millet for the country.

    原棉车上安装“增产节约拾棉袋”
    编辑同志：国营天津第一棉纺织厂栈务车间，过去原棉的浪费是很严重的。这个车间向清花车间每天运原棉十万多斤，其中有的是破包和零碎的棉花，这种棉花掉在地上的很多，从前根本没人管。工人张芙五看到这种浪费现象，建议在推原棉的小车上安装“增产节约拾棉袋”。实行这个建议后，每个职工看到地上掉了棉花，就马上拾起来，扔到拾棉袋里。每月平均可节省原棉三百余斤，全年可为国家积累价值四万斤小米的财富。
