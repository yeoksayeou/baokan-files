    Soldiers and Cadres in the Suburbs of Shijiazhuang Rescue from Hailstorm Disaster
    Editor: On the afternoon of July 7th, farmers in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City were busy working in the fields when suddenly a yellow cloud came from the northwest, and large raindrops began to fall. The farmers all ran home; the farmers planting sweet potatoes knew that it was easier for sweet potatoes to survive when it rained, so none of them wanted to go back. Who knew that soon after, hailstones suddenly began to fall. Some of the hailstones were the size of walnuts, and some were the size of teacups. Some farmers were hit so hard that their skin was broken and bleeding, and they could hardly crawl. At this time, nearby People's Liberation Army soldiers heard that many farmers planting sweet potatoes had been hit on the way, so they immediately put on their helmets, braved the hailstorm and wind and rain, crossed the river and waded through the water, and carried the dying farmers back one by one.
    The next day, district cadres came to the disaster area to express their condolences; city work teams also came to do rescue work; and cadres from the Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Insurance Company of China came to investigate the disaster and prepare for compensation. The farmers were very moved and said, "Who helped us and comforted us when we suffered from natural disasters in the past? The current government is really good!"
    On the third day, the ground was no longer sticky and it was possible to work in the fields. In order to fight against natural disasters and strive for a good harvest this year, the farmers mustered up their courage and planted other crops. The People's Government transported a large number of white jade corn and fast-growing millet seeds to supply to the farmers in the disaster area, and also mobilized farmers in non-disaster areas to prepare sweet potato vines and sell them to the disaster victims at reasonable prices for urgent use. The masses in non-disaster areas also organized themselves, traveling in groups with carts, bringing dry food, hay, and farm tools to help the disaster victims replant. In just a few days, the newly planted corn and millet in the disaster area sprouted, and the sweet potatoes also sprouted new tender tips, and the fields once again turned into a green world.
    In the old society, when farmers suffered from natural disasters, it was an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to speculate and make a fortune, and grain and commodity prices would skyrocket, and the disaster victims could only flee and beg for food. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army and cadres are helping the disaster victims, and the people are united to help each other. Natural disasters are not so terrible.

### 石家庄郊区战士干部抢救雹灾

    石家庄郊区战士干部抢救雹灾
    编辑同志：七月七日下午，石家庄市郊区的农民正在地里忙着耕作，突然西北方来了一片黄云，大雨点立刻落下来。农民们都往家里跑；栽甘薯的农民知道下雨时栽甘薯容易活，谁也不肯回去。谁知不久，突然落下冰雹来了。栽甘薯的农民赶快往回跑，可是已经来不及了。冰雹有的像胡桃那样大，有的像茶碗那样大。有些农民们被砸得皮破血流，几乎都爬不动了。这时附近的解放军战士听说有不少栽甘薯的农民被砸到半路上，立刻戴上钢盔，冒着冰雹风雨，渡河趟水，把奄奄待毙的农民们一个个都背了回来。
    第二天，区干部都到灾区来慰问；市内工作队也来作救伤工作；中国人民保险公司石家庄分公司的干部来调查灾情，准备赔偿。农民们非常感动，都说：“过去闹天灾有谁帮助咱们，安慰咱们呀？现在的政府真是好呀！”
    到第三天，地里不黏了，可以下地工作了。为了和天灾作斗争，为了争取今年的丰收，农民们都鼓足了勇气，另种其他庄稼。人民政府运来了大批的白玉茭和快谷子种，供给灾区农民应用，又动员非灾区的农民，准备甘薯蔓，用合理的价格卖给灾民急用。非灾区的群众们也都组织起来，成群结队，赶着大车，带上干粮干草和农具，前来帮助灾民重新耕作。不多几日，灾区新种的玉茭、谷子发芽了，甘薯也发出新的嫩尖，田野又变成了绿的世界。
    旧社会里，农民受了天灾，正是奸商们投机发财的机会，粮价物价都要猛涨，灾民们只有逃荒讨饭。现在在毛主席的领导下，解放军、干部都来帮助灾民，人民团结一起，互助互济，天灾不是那么可怕了。
