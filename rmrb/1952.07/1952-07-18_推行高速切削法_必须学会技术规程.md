    To Promote High-Speed Cutting, Technical Regulations Must Be Mastered
    When the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2 promoted high-speed cutting, the loss rate of cemented carbide tools was particularly high: 30% to 46% on Soviet lathes and as high as 91% on belt-driven lathes. The main reason for this situation was that workers did not master the basic knowledge of high-speed cutting and the operating procedures for cemented carbide tools.
    There are two types of cemented carbide tools: one for cutting cast iron and non-ferrous metals, and one for cutting steel. However, the technicians did not tell the workers about the performance of these two types. Only after the workers had used the wrong tools and damaged them did the technicians blame the workers. The operating procedures for cemented carbide tools were also not told to the workers beforehand. When the tools were damaged, the technicians would nag the workers: "Cemented carbide tools cannot be sharpened with ordinary grinding wheels," "Grinding alloy tools cannot be dipped in water, otherwise they will crack," "You shouldn't extend the tool so far and pad the tool so high..."
    In fact, it is not difficult for workers to master the basic knowledge of high-speed cutting and the operating procedures for the main tools. In the spring of 1951, Machinery Factory No. 2 asked technicians to teach the workers working on Soviet lathes the principles of high-speed cutting and the performance and operating procedures of the main tools. In just two months, the workers generally mastered the basic techniques, so the loss rate of cemented carbide tools in May and June dropped to 30%. However, the leadership did not summarize this experience well. When rushing to complete tasks in November, they promoted high-speed cutting among workers who had not undergone training, and other technical conditions were not well prepared, so the loss of cemented carbide tools reached 91%.

### 推行高速切削法  必须学会技术规程

    推行高速切削法
    必须学会技术规程
    东北机械二厂推广高速切削法时，硬质合金刀的损耗率特别高：在苏联车床上为百分之三十到四十六；在皮带车床上竟达百分之九十一。产生这种情况的主要原因是工人没掌握高速切削法的基本知识和硬质合金刀的使用规程。
    硬质合金刀有两种：一种是用来切削铸铁和有色金属的；一种是用来切削钢料的。但是技术人员没有把这两种的性能告诉工人，直到工人用差了和弄坏了刀具后，他才责怪工人。关于硬质合金刀具的使用规程，也是事前没有告诉工人，等到弄坏刀具时，技术员才喋喋不休地对工人说：“硬质合金刀不能用普通砂轮磨”，“磨合金刀不能沾水，沾了水就要碎裂的”，“你不应该把刀伸出那么长，把刀垫垫得那么高……”。
    其实，要使工人掌握高速切削法的基本知识和主要工具的使用规程并不困难。一九五一年春天，机械二厂曾要技术员给在苏联车床上工作的工人讲授高速切削的原理及主要工具的性能和使用规程，仅仅两个月的时间，工人大体上就能掌握基本的技术了，因而五、六两个月的硬质合金刀的损耗率就降低到百分之三十。但是，领导方面没有很好总结这一经验，在十一月赶任务的时候，又在没经过学习的工人中推广高速切削，加上其他的技术条件没准备好，所以硬质合金刀的损耗就达到百分之九十一。    （杨洛林）
