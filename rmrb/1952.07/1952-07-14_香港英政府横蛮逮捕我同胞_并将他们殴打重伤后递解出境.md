Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: The Hong Kong British government on the 11th once again adopted extremely barbaric means, arresting Wu Hua Xuan, chairman of the Hong Kong Telephone Company Hong Kong and Kowloon Chinese Staff Union, Secretary Peng Yi Quan, Secretary Bao Shao Qiu, Director of the Propaganda Department Zhang Yao Liu, Director of the Recreation Department Su Yong Ping, Council Member Xu Jiong Tang, and Zeng Zhong Ren, representative of the Chinese workers in the Automatic Exchange Department of the Hong Kong Telephone Company, and after severely beating and injuring them, deported them.

On the 11th, from 4:00 to 5:00 in the morning, the Hong Kong British government dispatched armed police and plainclothes secret agents to break into the residences of Wu Hua Xuan and the other seven people, and without stating any reason, arrested them. When they were being taken from the Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui pier to Tai Po in a prison van, British police and their running dogs viciously took turns beating them for more than an hour, leaving all seven covered in bruises. Peng Yi Quan was beaten until he lost consciousness and fell down. The British police then grabbed his hair, pulled him up, beat him again, and pushed him back down. This was repeated many times, and Peng suffered serious injuries to his chest, waist, head, and legs. He now has great difficulty walking and speaking. Su Yong Ping's entire body was beaten and swollen, and his right eye was also seriously injured, almost to the point of blindness. At around 10:00 AM on the same day, the British police deported them with the "reason" that "the Governor doesn't like you."

Wu Hua Xuan and the others arrived in Guangzhou on the evening of the 11th, and were welcomed and warmly comforted by the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and other organizations. The people of Guangzhou expressed great anger at the Hong Kong British government's barbaric persecution of the Chinese people.

    香港英政府横蛮逮捕我同胞
    并将他们殴打重伤后递解出境
    【新华社广州十三日电】香港英国政府十一日又采用极端横蛮的手段，将香港电话公司港九华员职工会主席吴华轩、书记彭溢泉、秘书鲍绍裘、宣传部主任张耀鎏、康乐部主任苏永平、理事徐炯堂和香港电话公司自动机楼部中国工人代表曾仲仁等七人逮捕，并将他们殴打重伤后递解出境。
    十一日晨四时至五时，香港英国政府先后派出武装警察和便衣特务，闯入吴华轩等七人的寓所，不说明任何理由，即将他们逮捕。当他们被集中从九龙尖沙咀码头用囚车押往大埔时，英警和走狗在车上竟凶横地轮流将他们毒殴一个多钟头之久，七人都被打得遍体鳞伤。彭溢泉被打得神智昏迷倒下后，英警竟抓紧他的头发拉起来，又毒打一阵后将他推倒下去。这样反复多次，彭的胸部、腰部、头部、腿部都受了重伤，现在走路、说话都十分困难。苏永平周身都被打得红肿，右眼亦受重伤，几至失明。同日上午十时左右，英警即以“港督不喜欢你们”为“理由”，将他们押解出境。
    吴华轩等已在十一日晚抵达广州，受到广东省总工会筹备会等团体的欢迎和亲切的慰问。广州人民对香港英国政府这种蛮横迫害中国人民的暴行，表示极大的愤怒。
