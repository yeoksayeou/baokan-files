    The results of key pilot agricultural production cooperatives in North China have shown that this more advanced form of mutual aid and cooperation organization fully demonstrates its superiority in production, pointing out the direction for the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the entire region.
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in North China has a history of ten years. Last year, the organized labor force in the region reached half of the total labor force. The vast number of farmers have been able to deeply appreciate the advantages of mutual aid production. However, with the development of the rural economy, in some advanced areas, the original "mutual aid group" form of collective labor and decentralized management has gradually shown that it can no longer meet the requirements of farmers for expanded reproduction. Therefore, enriching the new content of mutual aid, improving existing mutual aid organizations, and further developing production have become the urgent requirements of advanced farmers. Last spring, some advanced mutual aid groups in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi, carried out reorganization and pilot agricultural production cooperatives. Last winter and this spring, North China provinces summarized mutual aid experience, trained a group of key members of mutual aid groups, and then, in areas with a relatively solid foundation for mutual aid movement, established some agricultural production cooperatives with emphasis.
    Whether the agricultural production cooperatives were piloted last spring or opened last winter and this spring, they have all shown greater advantages than mutual aid groups. The advantages of agricultural production cooperatives are:
    First, it can more rapidly improve agricultural productivity and develop sideline production. Taking the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, which was piloted last spring, as an example, the average yield per mu in the autumn harvest last year increased by 32 percent compared with the mutual aid group period in 1950; the total value of sideline production last year was more than 10,000 jin of grain, an increase of more than two times compared with 1950. Because of the increased income, the cooperative was able to use more than 15,000 jin of grain to expand reproduction this year. These achievements cannot be compared with any mutual aid group in Chuandi Village, where the cooperative is located.
    Second, agricultural production cooperatives unify the management of land, can plant according to local conditions in a planned way, and gradually change the decentralized management method of "planting whatever is needed and having a little of everything," giving full play to the effectiveness of the land and increasing production.
    Third, cooperatives can more rationally allocate and use labor, precisely divide labor, and make the best use of talents. For example, those who can cultivate the land specialize in cultivating the land, and those who can engage in sideline production specialize in sideline production, so that agricultural technology can be improved and sideline production can be rapidly developed.
    Fourth, because of unified management, cooperatives can more easily accumulate and concentrate funds, and enhance the power of expanding reproduction. The ten agricultural production cooperatives piloted in Changzhi Prefecture last spring purchased more than 170 pieces of agricultural tools, ten carts, and a large number of cattle and sheep in the first year, solving the difficulties that individual households and small-scale mutual aid could not solve.
    Fifth, cooperatives can strengthen the planning of production and gradually overcome the blindness of small-scale agricultural production. This year, agricultural production cooperatives in North China have all earnestly formulated plans to increase production in accordance with the call of the state and took the lead in participating in the patriotic production increase competition. Agricultural production cooperatives in cotton areas have all made plans this year not to blindly expand cotton fields, but to focus on increasing the yield per unit area. The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative recently formulated a three-year plan to change the backwardness of mountain production within three years.
    Sixth, cooperatives can further strengthen the collective ideology of farmers and improve the political and cultural level of farmers. In the case of decentralized management, each farmer is only concerned about his own land and production; after unified management, the success or failure of any piece of land in the cooperative is related to himself, and each member is concerned about the harvest of the whole cooperative from caring about himself. The political and cultural life of the successfully piloted agricultural production cooperatives is generally better. The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, has basically eliminated illiteracy among young members one year after its establishment. Many cooperatives have subscriptions to books and popular publications, and have collective cultural and recreational activities. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi also have an "Patriotism Day" system. Collective political and cultural life has a great effect on raising the awareness of members and cultivating collectivist consciousness.
    The agricultural production cooperatives piloted in various places have basically implemented the policy of steady development. The so-called steady development means that a cooperative can be established only when the following three conditions are met: First, the local mutual aid and cooperation movement has a long history, there are some mutual aid groups with a long history and rich experience, and there are a number of experienced key members who can lead larger-scale organizations. Second, mutual aid groups require further improvement of production on the basis of the improvement of production, so they require to be upgraded to agricultural production cooperatives, and those farmers who have mutual aid experience are enthusiastic about participating in agricultural production cooperatives. Third, it must be after thoroughly publicizing the agricultural production cooperative to the farmers and after the farmers' own full deliberation and discussion. This is a steady approach. This year, there are also individual areas in North China that have a tendency to develop blindly, ignoring the foundation and conditions, forcibly compiling and piecing together, or abandoning leadership over the spontaneous actions of farmers to establish agricultural production cooperatives. The experience of running agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of North China is:
    First, adhere to the principle of voluntariness and implement the policy of steady development. From mutual aid group to agricultural production cooperative is a big change. At the beginning, farmers mostly hold a tentative and wait-and-see attitude. Generally, local governments first carry out in-depth publicity, and then pilot typical demonstrations. Only after the farmers are really willing to organize cooperatives and various conditions are generally available, will they steadily develop from mutual aid groups to agricultural production cooperatives. When Changzhi and other places in Shanxi Province focused on developing agricultural production cooperatives last winter, each county summoned leading cadres of agricultural production cooperatives to go to the villages preparing to establish cooperatives to spread achievements and experience and answer various questions raised by farmers. This has been of great help to the establishment of new cooperatives.
    Second, the cooperative must have a reasonable distribution principle, and there should be reasonable evaluation, recording, and reward methods for work during the period, and there must be a set of production management system. The distribution of crops is a matter related to the nature and development direction of agricultural production cooperatives. The distribution ratio of agricultural production cooperatives in North China is mostly based on labor. Local experience has proved that this distribution principle has a great effect on promoting farmers' enthusiasm for labor and improving production efficiency. However, in a small number of cooperatives, the distribution is based on land and capital, and labor is secondary. Local governments are paying attention to educating farmers to gradually change this unreasonable phenomenon and increase the proportion of labor distribution. Regarding the evaluation and recording system, the methods implemented by agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of North China are different, including piece-rate work recording, activity-based work evaluation, and fixed-point living calculation. For example, Guo Yu'en Cooperative uses "labor points" as the unit of work recording, ten points are one "labor day," and special skills and heavy labor are counted more points, and agricultural and sideline industries are calculated uniformly. This approach has a better effect.
    Third, strengthen leadership and strictly control. In the pilot of agricultural production cooperatives, the leaders in various places have proposed "only allow to do well, not allow to do badly," and "do one, succeed one." When Shanxi and other places were piloting, they chose areas with stronger Communist Party branches to run agricultural production cooperatives, and sent special personnel from the county and district to strengthen leadership. The pilot plans in various places were controlled by the county leading organs and reviewed and approved by the prefectural leading organs. This prevents blind development. Leading cadres of the local committees of the Communist Party in various prefectures personally guide one or two cooperatives to gain experience and guide the general. In the pilot projects in Wuxiang and Ping順 counties in Shanxi Province, many mutual aid groups jointly requested the leadership to approve their establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, which were carefully reviewed by the local leading organs. In individual places in Hebei Province, because the leadership was not cautious enough in mastering, there were more than 20 cooperatives in one village. Because the conditions were not available and the leadership was weak, it caused a bad influence on farmers on agricultural production cooperatives.
    Fourth, in the early stage of establishing agricultural production cooperatives, the scale should not be too large, generally about 20 households per cooperative is appropriate. Within a village, efforts should only be concentrated on running one well, cultivating cadres, educating farmers, and creating experience for future development. The practice of several cooperatives in a village in the early stage is problematic.
    North China is adopting a policy of combining leadership and the masses to conduct individual reviews and separate treatment of existing agricultural production cooperatives. For those who are generally qualified and the masses are highly enthusiastic, send personnel to help, specialize in leadership, and solve problems to consolidate and develop them; for those who are not qualified and develop rashly and blindly, persuade and educate the masses to transform into various mutual aid groups, prepare conditions, and run them again in the future.

### 华北各地农业生产合作社稳步发展

    华北各地农业生产合作社稳步发展
    华北各地重点试办农业生产合作社的结果，已表明这种较高级的互助合作组织形式，在生产中充分显示了它的优越性，为全区互助合作运动指出了前进的方向。
    华北区的互助合作运动，已有十年历史。去年全区组织起来的劳力已达总劳力的半数。广大农民已能深刻体会到互助生产的优越性。但随着农村经济的发展，在部分先进地区，原有的集体劳动、分散经营的“互助组”形式，逐渐地表明了已不能满足农民扩大再生产的要求。因此，充实互助新内容，提高现有互助组织，进一步发展生产，成为先进农民的迫切要求。去年春季，山西长治专区就有个别的先进互助组进行改组，试办农业生产合作社。去冬今春华北各省曾总结了互助经验，训练了一批互助组骨干分子，接着就在互助运动较有基础的地区，有重点地办了一些农业生产合作社。
    无论去春试办的或去冬今春才开办的农业生产合作社，都已显著地表现出比互助组更大的优越性。农业生产合作社的优越性是：
    第一、它能更迅速地提高农业生产力和发展副业生产。以山西省平顺县去春试办的郭玉恩农业生产合作社为例，该社去年秋收每亩平均产量比一九五○年互助组时期增产百分之三十二；该社去年副业生产总值为原粮一万多斤，较一九五○年增加两倍以上。该社因收入增加，今年得以用一万五千多斤原粮扩大再生产。这些成绩，不是该社所在村庄——川底村的任何一个互助组比得上的。
    第二、农业生产合作社统一经营土地，能有计划地因地种植，集中种植，逐渐改变了“用啥种啥、样样有点”的分散经营方式，充分发挥土地效能，增加产量。
    第三、合作社能更合理地调配和使用劳力，精密分工，人尽其才。如会耕地的专管耕地，能经营副业的专管副业，使农作技术有所改进，副业得到迅速发展。
    第四、合作社由于统一经营，所以较易积累和集中资金，增强了扩大再生产的力量。长治专区去春试办的十个农业生产合作社，头一年即伙购农具一百七十多件，大车十辆和大批牛羊，解决了单干户和小范围互助所不能解决的困难。
    第五、合作社能加强生产的计划性，逐渐克服小农生产的盲目性。华北各地的农业生产合作社，今年都依照国家的号召认真地制订增产计划，带头参加了爱国增产竞赛。棉区的农业生产合作社，今年都订了不盲目扩大棉田、着重提高单位面积产量的计划。李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，最近又制订了一个三年计划，要在三年内改变山区生产落后的面貌。
    第六、合作社能进一步加强农民的集体主义的思想，提高农民的政治文化水平。在分散经营的情况下，每个农民都只关心他自己的土地和生产；统一经营后，全社任何一块土地收成好坏，都与自己有关，每个社员都由关心自己进而关心全社的收获。试办成功的农业生产合作社，政治文化生活一般都较好，山西平顺县郭玉恩农业生产合作社成立一年，青年社员中的文盲已基本上消灭了。不少合作社都订有书报和通俗刊物，有集体的文化娱乐活动。山西有些农业生产合作社还定有“爱国日”制度。集体的政治文化生活，对提高社员觉悟和培养集体主义的意识有很大作用。
    各地试办的农业生产合作社，基本上执行了稳步发展的方针。所谓稳步发展，就是具备下列三个条件时才建社：一、当地互助合作运动已有较长的历史，有一些已有丰富经验的历史较长的互助组，有一批有经验的能够领导规模较大的组织的骨干分子。二、互助组在生产已有提高的基础上要求进一步提高生产，因而要求提高为农业生产合作社，那些已有互助经验的农民对参加农业生产合作社有热情。三、必须在深入地向农民宣传农业生产合作社，并经过农民自己充分酝酿讨论之后。这样的作法才是稳当的作法，今年华北也有个别地区，发生盲目发展的偏向，不顾基础和条件，强编硬凑，或对农民自发成立农业生产合作社的行动放弃领导。华北各地办农业生产合作社的经验是：
    一、坚持自愿原则，贯彻稳步发展方针。从互助组到农业生产合作社，是一个大的改变，开始时农民多抱试探、观望态度。各地一般是先深入宣传，然后试办作典型示范，等农民真正愿意组织合作社，而各种条件又大体具备情况之后，才稳步地由互助组发展为农业生产合作社。山西长治等地，在去冬有重点地发展农业生产合作社时，各县都曾召集农业生产合作社的领导干部，到准备建社的村庄去，传播成绩和经验，并解答农民提出的各种问题。这对于建立新社帮助很大。
    二、合作社要有合理的分配原则，平时应有合理的评工、记工、奖励的办法，要有一套生产管理制度。收获物的分配，是有关农业生产合作社的性质与发展方向的问题。华北的农业生产合作社的分配比例，大部是以劳力为主的。各地经验证明，这种分配原则，对发扬农民劳动积极性，提高生产效率有很大作用。但有少数合作社，分配是以土地、资本为主，劳力为副的，各地正注意教育农民逐渐改变这种不合理现象，增加劳力分配的比例。关于评工、记工制度，华北各地农业生产合作社所实行的办法各有不同，有按件记工、按活评工、死分活计等多种。如郭玉恩社是以“劳动分”为记工单位，十分为一“劳动日”，特殊技术和繁重劳动多计分，农副业统一计算。这种办法效果较好。
    三、加强领导，严格掌握。农业生产合作社试办中，各地领导上都曾提出了“只许办好、不许办坏”，“办一个、成一个”。山西等地试办时，选择共产党支部较强的地区办农业生产合作社，由县、区派遣专人加强领导。各地试办计划都由县领导机关掌握，由专区领导机关审查批准。这就防止了盲目发展。中共各专区地方委员会领导干部并亲自指导一两个合作社，以取得经验，指导一般。山西省武乡、平顺等县试办中，有不少互助组联合要求领导上批准他们办农业生产合作社，都经过当地领导机关的详细审查。河北省个别地方，由于领导上掌握不够慎重，有一村建社到二十个以上的，因为条件不具备，再加领导薄弱，因此造成农民对农业生产合作社的不良影响。
    四、创办农业生产合作社的初期，规模不宜太大，一般每社以二十户左右为宜。一村之内也只应集中精力办好一个，培养干部、教育农民、创造经验，为今后发展作准备。初办时期一村数社的作法是有毛病的。
    华北各地对现有的农业生产合作社，正采取领导与群众相结合的方针，进行逐个审查分别处理。对条件大体具备群众热情较高的，派员帮助，专人领导，解决问题，使之巩固发展；对条件不具备，草率盲目发展的，说服教育群众转变为各种互助组，准备条件，今后再办。    （新华社）
