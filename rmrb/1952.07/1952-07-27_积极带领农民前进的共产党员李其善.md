    Li Qishan, A Communist Party Member Who Actively Leads Farmers Forward
    Gengdi
    A Fierce Ideological Struggle
    Li Qishan joined the Chinese Communist Party in October 1949 and was elected deputy village chief of Yicun Village, Sixiang Township, Guowang District, Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province in the winter of 1950. Before Party rectification, Li Qishan's selfish and self-serving thoughts were serious. He believed: "Being a cadre wears out your shoes and delays your work; others get richer and richer, while we get poorer and poorer, it's not worth it." Last autumn, the higher-level Party committee selected some villages for key Party rectification, and Li Qishan participated. After studying the theories of communism and the Communist Party, Li Qishan understood that his selfish and self-serving thoughts were incompatible with communist ideology; he understood that to strive for the cause of communism, he must overcome his selfish and self-serving thoughts. Even so, when Party rectification entered the registration stage, Li Qishan still underwent a fierce internal struggle. He didn't rest peacefully for three days and nights, thinking about everything. He asked himself: "What if we don't have enough to eat later on?"
    "What if the Party tells me to go somewhere else, but I have things to do?" "If I'm a Party member or a cadre, meetings will take up half the night, and I won't be able to bear the drowsiness the next day, I won't be able to do a good job, and I won't live a good life, what should I do?" At this time, Li Qishan remembered the past. He thought: he used to be a poor peasant, working as a long-term laborer for six years, getting up at the rooster's crow and working until midnight. The head of the bao, Luo Yuankai, insisted that he pay the grain tax on his land, and he was almost beaten when he went to reason with Luo Yuankai. Li Qishan also thought: since the Communist Party came, although he had been liberated; however, this was only the first step in the Long March, and he would still have to move towards agricultural collectivization and towards a communist society. In the future, tractors will be used everywhere in the countryside, production will be more developed, and everyone will live a better life. Communist Party members should abandon their selfish and self-serving thoughts and lead the people towards such a happy society. Li Qishan repeatedly thought about these things, and he had firm confidence in the realization of communism, and he felt that being a Communist Party member was indeed supremely glorious. At this time, Li Qishan also looked through the history of the Chinese Communist Party over thirty years and pictures of Liu Hulan, and saw hundreds and thousands of revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the cause of communism. When Liu Hulan was captured by the enemy, she firmly said: Folks, go back, our cause will be victorious day by day, and the enemy will eventually fall into our hands. At this time, Li Qishan couldn't help but shed tears, feeling that his selfish and self-serving thoughts were shameful. Communist Party members should "live greatly and die gloriously!" So he decided to register as a Party member. On the way, he said to himself: "From today onwards, I swear to the Party: I am determined to serve the people wholeheartedly and never tarnish the good reputation of a Communist Party member." After review, the Party branch believed that Li Qishan had the conditions to be a Communist Party member.
    Mobilizing the Masses to "Organize Themselves"
    From then on, Li Qishan became active and became the happiest person in the village. Once, his wife complained to him: "Hou Shengquan is also a cadre (village farmers' association member, non-Party member), but he is not busy; but you are so busy that you don't even have time to eat, and you always come back in the middle of the night." He replied: "Why compare Hou Shengquan to me? I'm a Communist Party member, and I have a responsibility to lead everyone towards communism."
    In February of this year, in order to carry out the mutual aid movement, Li Qishan went around the village publicizing the benefits of "organizing themselves." He said: Organizing ourselves is like building a wall, it is laying the foundation for future socialism. In the future, we will collectivize, and life will get better and better. The listeners just nodded and said, "That's right!" But they were not convinced in their hearts. Some people directly raised the issue. Some people said: "What you say makes sense, but if I hoe for you today, and hoe for him tomorrow, and it rains the day after tomorrow, what if my land isn't hoed?" Others said: "When it comes to watering the fields, we must never help each other, if we wait until we finish watering this person's field, that person's crops will dry out and die." Still others said: "People always hope to do more work for themselves, doesn't organizing ourselves mean doing less work?" Li Qishan patiently explained to everyone. He said: "Let's talk about watering the fields, there is also a distinction between urgency. Some need water urgently, and some can wait a little longer. Everyone can discuss together and arrange the order, and no one will be delayed. Moreover, there are many kinds of farm work, if there are ten people, five people can shake the water scoops (iron shovels) a day, and the rest can take the time to change, and someone can hoe the fields that have been watered early, so what are you worried about?" Everyone felt that Li Qishan made sense. But then someone asked: "We can't work in the mutual aid group on an empty stomach." Li Qishan felt that this was indeed a problem. He thought for a while, and said: "The group can lend to each other." Then, he talked about the method of evaluating work and keeping accounts in the mutual aid group, saying that the extra work would be paid wages, and there would also be ways to help those who lacked food. Finally, Li Qishan talked about the principles of organizing ourselves, responding to the government's call, increasing production, and building the country. The masses excitedly said: "Oh, that includes patriotism!" At this time, the young people rushed to say: "Let's do it!" But some people still couldn't figure it out: "Oh dear, it's so troublesome! Evaluating work and calculating accounts, that's really enough to bear." Although this was just the opinion of a few individuals, Li Qishan still patiently explained: "It's not troublesome to evaluate work and calculate accounts, it can be done when we gather to do work or eat. Besides, when evening comes, who doesn't squat by the door with a pipe in their mouth, chatting idly? Taking advantage of this time, the mutual aid group members can squeeze together and talk about the work for the next day. How can that delay anything?" The masses all said: "That's right! If there's time for idle talk, how can there not be time for evaluating work and calculating accounts." At this time, many people were noisily discussing: "Let's not talk about anything else, what we worry about is lazy fellows messing with you, there's no way to deal with that. Who's going to carry him to the field!" Hearing this, some lazy people squatted there without saying a word. The hard-working farmers asked: "Qishan, tell us, isn't this a difficult problem?" The whole field was silent for a moment. "Not difficult, not difficult," Li Qishan replied, "Don't be afraid of lazy people. We have this method of evaluating work and keeping accounts, whoever does less work and does rough work will naturally be evaluated less. Besides, laziness is not inborn, it's a victim of the old society. Like a tree, it's hard to guarantee that it won't grow a branch, but if you cut it, it will become material. Everyone has shortcomings, and everyone can correct them with criticism. Not to mention anything else, how many people used to smoke and gamble in this area, are there any now? The people are still there, but they have changed. Everyone, think about it, is there any bad habit that can't be changed?" Li Qishan's words solved the problems raised by everyone. Everyone was very happy, and some even happily repeated in secret: "People who smoke and gamble have changed, are there any people who can't be changed?" In this way, it took half the evening to finally convince the masses. Afterwards, the masses went to find those who they got along with well and lived near, contacted them, and organized many mutual aid groups. Li Qishan also organized a mutual aid group with others.
    Consolidating the Mutual Aid Group with His Own Exemplary Actions
    Li Qishan thought that after organizing themselves, the important thing was to find ways to consolidate it. He thought: In addition to constantly solving problems for others, he had to run his own mutual aid group well. Therefore, he got up early and worked late, and he always chose the heavy work to do himself. This spring, when it was time to hoe the wheat, everyone discussed together which field to hoe first. No one spoke, everyone wanted to hear Li Qishan's opinion, and everyone thought: "Maybe he will agree to hoe my field first." Li Qishan had been thinking about what was the fairest and most reasonable way. He had made up his mind, and said: "First hoe for the military families, then do the urgent work first, and the less urgent work later. As for my wheat, it can be put last." As a result, the people in the group all figured it out, and some even made self-criticisms: "Why didn't I think of giving priority to military families and doing the urgent work first, and only thinking about my own affairs. He doesn't think as small as I do." When harvesting wheat and watering corn, Li Qishan also put forward many reasonable practices. As for his own work, he always suggested putting it at the end.
    In addition to being busy leading production in the group, Li Qishan often went to the township government for meetings because he was the deputy village chief, which would take up half a day or a day. When the group members saw this, they felt sorry for him and said to him: "Since you are busy for everyone's sake, we should give you work points." Li Qishan firmly disagreed with this practice. He said: "Communist Party members serve everyone. Serving everyone is the most glorious thing for a Communist Party member. It is unreasonable to give work points for such things."
    Sometimes, because some group members delayed some work, everyone was very angry and wanted to deduct their points. Li Qishan disagreed with this hasty approach. He first patiently persuaded them and waited for others to make progress, and only deducted points when it was necessary. For example, Luo Fenghu always smoked a few pipes of tobacco before going to the field, so he was often late. Some group members got angry and advocated deducting his points, but Li Qishan persuaded Fenghu: "Being late delays everyone's work, which is detrimental to the whole group. Besides, if everyone is like you, going to sleep after eating tomorrow and then going to the field when they wake up, how much work will be delayed." After listening to Li Qishan's words, Luo Fenghu made some progress. Not long after, Fenghu's old problem recurred. At this time, Li Qishan led everyone to strictly criticize Luo Fenghu and deducted two work points from him. After such education, Luo Fenghu understood the idea and said movedly: "I am willing to have the points deducted, this is to educate me." Once, just as they were about to plant corn for Zhou Zongyu, Zhou Zongyu ran over and said: "You plant the corn well, hum! I see you just don't care about my work." Originally, Li Qishan was also a little angry, but he restrained himself. He patiently explained to him in a friendly manner. At the criticism meeting in the evening, he criticized Zhou Zongyu for being wrong to lose his temper. Zhou Zongyu also reviewed his mistake: because he had some anger between his brothers, he used Li Qishan as a punching bag to vent his anger, which was wrong. He must change in the future. Sometimes, when Li Qishan saw that some people were not doing mutual aid well, he always asked himself first: "What benefits has the mutual aid group given him, and has he suffered any losses? Is he so backward that he can't be reformed?" He often said to everyone: "Reforming people is a difficult task."
    As the head of the mutual aid group, Li Qishan often thought about the affairs of the whole group: how to improve farming techniques and increase grain production; how to organize sideline production and increase income; how many more carts and livestock should the group add in the autumn; and in the winter, he should free up his own house for the group members to learn some literacy and political principles at night. Li Qishan had a high prestige in the group, just as group member Zhou Zongmao said: "Our group leader doesn't distinguish between you and me when doing work, he rushes forward with all his might. He worries about everything in the group. How can people not love such a Communist Party member!" Caring for the Lives of the Masses
    Li Qishan was very concerned about the lives of the group members. Whenever the group members had difficulties, no matter how big or small, he always tried his best to help solve them. There are many such things, here is just one fact to illustrate: One day, Luo Fenghu's child fell seriously ill. Li Qishan's heart was covered with a cloud, and he was very anxious. He was busy greeting everyone to go and see. The people in the group also helped Luo Fenghu to invite a doctor overnight. Li Qishan didn't sleep well that night either, and went to Fenghu's house twice. Later, Luo Fenghu's child died, and the parents' hearts were broken. Li Qishan said to the group members: "Fenghu is not feeling well, let's help him harvest the crops, his pain is our pain." He went to comfort Luo Fenghu and said: "Anyone would be sad to encounter this situation; but being sad won't help, if you ruin your health, what can we hope for? Be patient, and take farming as a serious matter. You are still young, and there will be good days in the future." Luo Fenghu said movedly: "Qishan, if I was left alone (referring to if I hadn't joined the mutual aid group), I don't know what I would do. The mutual aid group is like my home." Moved by Li Qishan and the group members, Luo Fenghu continued to work as usual. Li Qishan said to people: Last year, when he was rectifying the Party, his own child died, and his wife complained that he was too careless, although he was also very sad, it didn't make him as sad as Luo Fenghu who had three children die in a row. Communist Party member Li Qishan cares about the suffering of the masses in this way.

    积极带领农民前进的共产党员李其善
    根蒂
    一场激烈的思想斗争
    李其善在一九四九年十月加入中国共产党，一九五○年冬天被选为本村（陕西省凤翔县虢王区四乡一村）副村长。整党以前，李其善的自私自利思想是严重的。他认为：“当干部跑烂鞋，耽搁工夫；人家越过越富，咱越弄越穷，划不来账。”去年秋天，上级党委选择了一些村子进行重点整党，李其善参加了整党。在学习了关于共产主义和共产党的理论以后，李其善明白了自己的自私自利思想和共产主义思想是不相容的；懂得了要为共产主义事业奋斗，必须克服自己的自私自利思想。虽然这样，在整党进入登记阶段的时候，李其善内心仍然进行了一场激烈的斗争。他有三个昼夜没有安静下来，什么都考虑到了。他问自己：“假若干到后来，没啥吃了怎么办？”
    “党叫我到别处去，而我又有事怎么办呢？”“当党员，当干部，一开会就是半晚上，第二天瞌睡得受不了，活做不好，光景过不美怎么办？”这时，李其善想起了过去的事情。他想：自己原是一个贫农，起鸡叫、打半夜地干了六年长工。保长罗元恺土地上的粮款硬要自己缴纳，去和罗元恺讲理，又几乎挨了打。李其善又想：自从共产党来了以后，自己虽然翻了身；可是，这只是万里长征走了第一步，以后还要走向农业集体化，走向共产主义社会。将来农村里到处使用着拖拉机，生产更加发达，大家生活得更好。共产党员就应当去掉自己的自私自利思想，领导人民走向这样幸福的社会。李其善反复地想着这些，就对实现共产主义有了坚定的信心，而且感到当个共产党员确实是无上光荣的。这时，李其善又翻看中国共产党三十年史画和刘胡兰的图片，看到成百成千的革命烈士，为了共产主义事业牺牲了自己的生命。刘胡兰被敌人捕走时，还坚定地说：乡亲们，你们回去吧，咱们的事业一天一天会胜利，敌人终究会落在咱们手中的。这时李其善不由得掉下泪来，感到自己的自私自利思想是可耻的。共产党员应该“生的伟大，死的光荣！”于是他决定去进行党员登记。路上，他对自己说：“从今天起我向党发誓：我立志全心全意为人民服务，永不沾辱共产党员的好名誉。”经过审查，党支部认为李其善具备着共产党员的条件。
    发动群众“组织起来”
    从此，李其善活跃起来了，成了村里最愉快的一个人。有一次，他妻子埋怨他：“侯生泉也是个干部（村农会委员、非党员），人家就不忙；可是你忙得一天连吃饭都顾不得吃，老是半晚上才回来。”他回答说：“为什么拿侯生泉和我比呢。咱是个共产党员，咱有责任领导大家往共产主义走。”
    今年二月间，为了开展互助运动，李其善在村里到处宣传“组织起来”的好处。他说：组织起来就和修墙一样，是给将来社会主义打根子。将来要集体化，日子越过越好。听众只是点头说：“对着哩！”但心里并不信服。有些人就直截了当地把问题提出来了。有人说：“说的有道理，但是，今天给你锄，明天给他锄，后天下雨了，我的地没锄怎办？”又有人说：“说到浇地，那可万万不能互助，等给这个浇毕，那个的田禾就干死啦。”又有人说：“人总盼望给自己多干活，组织起来不是活越做得少了。”李其善耐心地给大家解释。他说：“就说浇地吧，活也分个缓急。有的等水紧，有的可以稍微迟一下。大家在一块商量商量，排个先后次序，谁的也耽搁不了。况且庄稼活杂，有十个人的话，一天摇五把杆子（铁锨），其余的人还可以抽空换，早浇过的地也有人去锄，还愁什么呢。”大家感到李其善说得有道理。可是又有人问了：“参加互助组总不能饿着肚子干吧。”李其善觉得这倒是个问题。他想了想，就说：“组里可以互相借贷。”接着，他又讲了讲互助组评工记账的办法，说长出的工还给工资，缺粮的人，也有办法。最后李其善把组织起来，响应政府号召，增加生产，建设国家的道理又讲了一番。群众都兴奋地说：“噢，这里头还包括了爱国哩！”这时年青人抢先说：“干吧！”可是还有人想不通：“唉呀，好麻烦呀！又是计工，又是算账，那真够受。”虽然这只是个别人的意见，可是李其善仍然耐心地作了解释：“计工算账不麻烦，在收活或吃饭碰头的时候就办了。再说，一到黄昏，谁还不是噙个烟袋蹲在门边拉闲话呢。趁这个空儿，互助组员们就可以挤在一起，拉拉第二天的活。这能耽搁啥事情。”群众都说：“是呀！有拉闲话的空，那儿腾不出计工算账的空。”这时，许多人吵吵嚷嚷地谈论起来：“别的不说了，发愁的是懒家伙跟你捣蛋，这就没办法。谁把他抬到地里不成！”听了这话，有些懒惰的人蹲在那里只是一声不响。劳动好的农民又问：“其善，你说说，这不是个难题？”全场一时静了下来。“不难，不难。”李其善回答道，“不怕懒人。我们有评工记账这办法，谁做得少，活路粗，工自然评的少。再说，懒也不是天生的，这是受了旧社会的害。像树一样，难保不发个岔，可是，砍砍就会变成材料。谁也有个缺点，大家批评批评就能改正。不说别的，过去咱们这一带有多少吸烟赌钱的，现在还有没有？人都还在哩，就是变了。大家想一想，还有什么改变不了的毛病。”李其善的这番话，把大家提出来的问题解决了。大家很高兴，有的还高兴地暗暗学舌说：“吸烟赌钱的都变了，人，还有改变不了的？”就这样整整花了半个晚上的工夫，总算把群众说通了。过后，群众就去找和自己心眼对劲的，居住相近的连络起来，组织了好些互助组。李其善也和别人组织了一个互助组。
    用自己的模范行动巩固互助组
    李其善想，组织起来以后，要紧的是设法把它巩固下来。他想：这除了经常给别人解决问题以外，还得把自己的互助组搞好。因此，他起早贪黑，自己总拣重的活干。今年春季开始锄麦子，大家在
    一块商量先锄那一块。谁也不发言，大家都想听听李其善的意见，并且都这样想：“也许他会同意打我地里先锄吧。”李其善一直盘算着什么是最公平合理的办法。他想好了，说：“先给军属锄，然后，活急的先做，不太急的后做。至于我的麦子可以放到最后。”这一来，组里的人都想开了，有的还作了自我批评：“为什么我没有想到先优待军属，活急的先做，尽想着自己的事情。人家可不像我那么想的小。”在收麦、浇玉米时，李其善也提出了很多合情合理的作法。至于自己的活，他老是提出放在后边做。
    李其善除了在组里忙着领导生产以外，还因为担任副村长，常常到乡政府去开会，一耽搁就是半天或一天。组员们看了，过意不去，就对他说：“你既然为大家的事忙忙碌碌，咱们就应该给你记工。”李其善坚决不同意这种做法。他说：“共产党员就是为大家服务的。为大家服务，这是共产党员最光荣的事情。这样的事也要记工，是不合理的。”
    有时，因为有些组员耽误了一些活，大家都很气愤，要扣他们的分。李其善不同意这种过急的办法。他是先耐心地规劝，等待别人进步，不得已时，才扣分。比方罗逢虎，他每次上地前总要吸几袋烟，所以常常迟到。有些组员冒火了，主张扣他的分，李其善就劝逢虎说：“去的迟了，耽搁了大家的活，这对全组是不利的。再说人家都要像你这样子，明天吃过饭都去睡觉，醒来再上地，要耽搁多少活。”听了李其善的话，罗逢虎有了些进步。不久逢虎的老毛病又犯了。这时李其善领导大家对罗逢虎进行了严格的批评，并且扣了他二分工。罗逢虎经过这样的教育，思想搞通了，感动地说：“扣分我情愿，这是为了教育我。”有一次，正要给周宗玉种玉米，周宗玉跑来了，说：“你们把玉米种好了，哼！我看就是不管我的活。”本来，李其善也有些生气，但是他忍住了。和气地向他作了解释。晚上开检讨会时，他才批评周宗玉发脾气是不对的。周宗玉也检讨了自己的错误：因为兄弟之间有些气，就把李其善当气筒子来出气，这是不对的。往后一定要改过。有时，李其善看到有些人不好好搞互助时，老是先问自己：“互助组给了他什么好处，有没有使他吃亏的事情？难道他就落后到没法改造了吗？”他常常对大家说：“改造人可就是难事哩。”
    作为互助组长的李其善，脑子里经常考虑着全组的事情：怎样改进耕作技术，增加粮食产量；怎样组织副业生产，增加收入；秋天组里应该增加多少大车，多少牲口；冬天应该腾出自己的房子叫组员们晚上识点字，学些政治道理。李其善在组里的威信很高，正像组员周宗茂所说的：“我们的组长做活不分你我，一股劲往前扑。组里不论啥事心都操到了。这样的共产党员怎么叫人不爱呢！”关心群众的生活
    李其善对组员的生活非常关心。组员们一有困难，不管困难大小，总是想尽一切办法帮助解决。这样的事情是很多的，这里只举一个事实来说明：有一天，罗逢虎的孩子得了急病。李其善心上像蒙上了一层阴云，很着急。他就忙着招呼大家一块去看了看。组里的人又帮助罗逢虎连夜请来医生。李其善当晚也没有很好地睡觉，到逢虎家走了两趟。后来，罗逢虎的娃娃病死了，做父母的心可疼烂了。李其善对组员们说：“逢虎心里不好过，咱们帮他收庄稼，他的苦也就是咱们的苦。”他又去安慰罗逢虎说：“遇见这情景，谁也要难过；可是难过不顶啥，把身子弄坏了，咱们再指望啥呢。忍耐点，把庄稼当事干。人还年青，往后还有好日子。”罗逢虎很感动地说：“其善，要是留我一个人（指倘若没参加互助组），我不知怎么样呢。互助组真像我的家。”受了李其善和组员们的感动，罗逢虎还是照常干活。李其善对人说：去年整党时，他自己的孩子死了，老婆埋怨他太不操心，虽然他也很难过，但却没有罗逢虎一连死了三个孩子使他这样难过。共产党员李其善就是这样关心着群众的疾苦。
