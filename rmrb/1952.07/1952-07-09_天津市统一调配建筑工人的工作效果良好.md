    Tianjin's Unified Allocation of Construction Workers Yields Good Results
    The unified allocation of construction workers in Tianjin has achieved good results. Since the Tianjin Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Unified Allocation of Construction Workers in Tianjin" in late March this year, more than 42,000 construction workers have registered at the Municipal Construction Worker Unified Allocation Office, of which 24,000 have been assigned to various construction sites to work. In order to meet the needs of the upcoming comprehensive construction of various basic projects, the registration work will continue recently.
    The promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Unified Allocation of Construction Workers in Tianjin is mainly to completely abolish the feudal monopoly system in the construction industry. Since the implementation of these measures, construction workers have first been freed from the rule and exploitation of feudal foremen. After registering at the Unified Allocation Office, they can rely on the office to find work; and feudal foremen can no longer continue to exist by using the privilege of recruiting and dismissing workers. In the past three months, no cases of exploitation or disguised exploitation by feudal foremen have been found among the workers dispatched through the Unified Allocation Office. Their wages are mostly democratically assessed by the workers themselves at the construction site, and each worker can receive 100% of their deserved wages without any intermediate exploitation. Their daily working hours have been reduced from more than ten hours to nine hours, and medical treatment for injuries and illnesses has also been guaranteed. Therefore, the workers are very satisfied. For example, Liu Fuhai, a gray earth worker in the construction site of the construction worker dormitory, was assessed a daily wage of 22,000 yuan, and actually received 22,000 yuan, without being exploited in the slightest. He said: "Only now have we construction workers been completely liberated. Last autumn, when I worked with foreman Hua Wenshan, I worked eighteen hours a day, and my wage was less than 5,000 yuan. When I got sick, I was pushed out of the shack, and they didn't care whether I lived or died. Now, the Unified Allocation Office gives us work to do, working hours are shortened, wages are not exploited, small illnesses are treated at the clinic, and serious illnesses are treated at the hospital... All the things we hoped for have been realized!" Workers who have not yet been assigned to work and have difficulty in life can also wait patiently for allocation because they have the government's loan relief. For example, Li Yu, a carpenter, although he has not been assigned to work after registering, said very optimistically: "At the beginning of the anti-foreman movement, I was still afraid that if I tore my face, I would have to ask them for work in the future. Now that unified allocation has been implemented, I can calm down. I believe the government will notify me when there is work. I have already received a loan of 70,000 yuan." Now, he is studying the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line method with several fellow workers, preparing to use it in the upcoming comprehensive basic construction projects. Since the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Unified Allocation, the labor enthusiasm of construction workers has been unprecedentedly high. At all construction sites that have already started work, workers actively improve technology, adopt new operating methods, ensure project quality, and save a lot of wealth for the country. In the past three months, construction workers in Tianjin have created and improved more than 20 new operating methods and tools. Among the workers participating in the construction of 50,000 worker dormitories, more than 90% of the bricklayers have adopted Fu Hongbin's "circular bricklaying method," which has reduced the construction cost of each room from 5.1 million yuan to 4.7 million yuan, and the project quality is also relatively solid and durable. After the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line method was promoted at the above-mentioned construction site, the construction cost of each room was further reduced by 50,000 yuan. According to statistics, in this project, the use of the new method of wall construction alone can save the country more than 9.68 billion yuan, which can be used to build about 2,500 more worker dormitories.
    Due to the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Unified Allocation, the difficulty that various construction departments often had in finding workers temporarily before the start of projects in the past has also been resolved. For example, the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir Engineering Office recently needed a batch of cement and steel bar workers. After contacting the Tianjin Municipal Construction Worker Unified Allocation Office, the required workers arrived at the construction site in full within a week. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government's project to build 50,000 worker dormitories, the required construction workers were allocated by the Unified Allocation Office as needed, and the technical level of the workers dispatched generally met the agreed standards. In order to allocate workers in a more planned way, the Tianjin Municipal Unified Allocation Office has recently divided the registered workers of various types of work into four technical grades and divided them into district teams, platoons, and groups. In order to solve the problem that there may not be enough construction workers to allocate after the comprehensive commencement of basic construction projects, the Municipal Unified Allocation Office will allocate them in order of priority according to the basic principle of "national defense construction first, industrial construction second, ordinary construction third, and general repairs fourth" as stipulated in the Provisional Measures for Unified Allocation.

### 天津市统一调配建筑工人的工作效果良好

    天津市统一调配建筑工人的工作效果良好
    天津市统一调配建筑工人的工作已取得良好效果。自今年三月下旬天津市人民政府颁布“天津市建筑工人统一调配暂行办法”以来，已有四万二千多个建筑工人在市建筑工人统一调配处登记，其中二万四千人已分配到各施工场所去工作。为了适应即将全面开工的各项基本建设的需要，登记工作最近将继续进行。
    天津市建筑工人统一调配暂行办法的颁布，主要是为了彻底废除建筑业中的封建把持制度。这一办法颁布实施以来，首先就使建筑工人们摆脱了封建把头的统治和剥削。他们在统一调配处登记后，就可依靠该处找到工作；而封建把头们也就不能再用招收和解雇工人的特权继续存在。三个月来，经过统一调配处调配出去的工人，没有发现一件被封建把头剥削或变相剥削的事实。他们的工资大多是在工程现场由工人自己民主评定，每个工人都能百分之百地拿到自己应得的工资而不受任何中间剥削。他们每天的工作时间已由十几小时减为九小时，伤病医疗也有了保障。因此，工人们都很满意。例如七区灰土工人刘福海，在建筑工人宿舍的工程现场上，每天的工资被评定为两万二千元，实得也是两万二千元，丝毫不受剥削。他说：“直到现在，我们建筑工人才彻底得到解放。去年秋天，我跟把头华文山做工时，每天干十八个钟头的活，工资得不到五千元，病了往窝铺外一推，死活不管。现在，统一调配处给我们活做，工时缩短了，工资不受剥削了，小病去医务所，大病去医院……我们所希望的事情全实现啦！”目前尚未分配到工作而生活困难的工人，因为有人民政府的贷款救济，所以也能安心地等着分配。例如木工李玉，虽然登记后还未分配到工作，却非常乐观地说：“在开头反把头时，我还怕撕破了脸，将来找活做还得去求他们，现在实行了统一调配，我才沉住气了。我相信政府有了活一定会通知我的，我已经领到了七万元的贷款。”现在，他正和几个同行的工人一起研究谢万福木工流水作业法，准备在即将全面开工的基本建设工程中使用。统一调配暂行办法实施以来，建筑工人们的劳动热情空前高涨。在所有已经开工的工程现场上，工人们积极改进技术，采用新操作方法，保证工程质量，为国家节约大量财富。三个月来，天津市建筑工人已创造和改进了二十多种新操作方法和工具。参加建筑五万间工人宿舍的工人中，已有百分之九十以上的瓦工采用了傅鸿宾的“循环砌砖法”，使每间房屋的建筑费用由五百一十万降低到四百七十万元，工程质量也比较坚固耐久。谢万福木工流水作业法在上述工程现场推广后，使每间房屋的建筑费用又降低了五万元。据统计，在这一工程中，仅采用新法砌墙就可以为国家节省九十六亿八千多万元，这笔钱可用来多盖出大约二千五百间工人宿舍。
    由于统一调配暂行办法的实施，各施工部门历年来在工程开始前往往临时找不到工人的困难也得到了解决。例如永定河官厅水库工程处最近需要一批水泥和钢筋工人，他们和天津市建筑工人统一调配处接洽后，所需工人在一周内就如数到达了工程现场。天津市人民政府建筑五万间工人宿舍的工程，所需建筑工人经统一调配处的调配，作到了随要随拨，拨去的工人的技术水平一般都合乎议定的标准。为了更有计划地调配工人，天津市统一调配处最近又把已登记的各工种的工人分成四个技术等级，并分编为区队、中队和小组。为了解决基本建设工程全面开工后建筑工人可能不够分配的问题，市统一调配处将按照统一调配暂行办法规定的“国防建设第一，工业建设第二，普通建设第三，一般修缮第四”这一基本方针，分别轻重缓急依次调配。
