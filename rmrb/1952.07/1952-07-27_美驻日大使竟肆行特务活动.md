　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Murphy, not only commands the Japanese government as a "U.S. Governor," but also actively engages in espionage activities and expands intelligence organizations in Japan.

　　Since arriving in Japan, Murphy has established twenty-three intelligence centers throughout the country. These spy organizations incorporate labor scabs and traitors from the so-called "patriotic labor movement" in Japan, using them to conduct large-scale conspiratorial propaganda activities within these spy organizations. Murphy has already drafted a plan to increase the number of personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Japan from three hundred to seven hundred, turning the embassy into a Far East branch of the State Department.

　　Murphy is originally a veteran spy engaged in international espionage among U.S. foreign personnel. Before World War II, he engaged in espionage activities within the Nazi regime in Munich, which led to his expulsion by the German government. During World War II, when Clark commanded the North African landing operation, Murphy also served in espionage activities, and now the two are together again. After World War II, when Murphy served as the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, he also urged Belgium to establish an American-style army, causing a huge deficit in Belgium's national finances. The U.S. ruling clique's current selection of Murphy as its agent in Japan is obviously inseparable from Murphy's past criminal activities.

### 美驻日大使竟肆行特务活动

    美驻日大使竟肆行特务活动
    【新华社讯】东京消息：美国驻日大使墨菲不但以“美国总督”的身份指挥日本政府，并且积极在日本进行间谍活动，扩大特务组织。
    墨菲自抵日以后，已经在日本全国建立了二十三处情报中心。这些特务组织把日本所谓“爱国劳工运动”一派的工贼和卖国贼在这些间谍组织里面，利用他们进行大规模的阴谋宣传活动。墨菲已经拟就了一项计划，准备把美国驻日大使馆的人员从三百名增加到七百名，使大使馆成为国务院的远东支部。
    墨菲本来就是美国驻外人员中从事国际间谍活动的老特务。在第二次世界大战前，他曾在慕尼黑进行纳粹内部的间谍活动，因而被德国政府驱逐出境。在第二次大战中克拉克指挥北非登陆战役时，墨菲也担任着间谍活动，现在他们两个人又再度在一起了。第二次大战后，墨菲任美国驻比利时大使，他又督促比利时建立了美国式的陆军，使比利时的国家财政发生了庞大的赤字。美国统治集团现在又选派墨菲为它在日本的代理人，显然与墨菲过去的罪恶活动是分不开的。
