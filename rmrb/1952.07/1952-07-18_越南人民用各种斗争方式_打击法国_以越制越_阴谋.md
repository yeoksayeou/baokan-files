(Xinhua News Agency, July 17th dispatch from North Vietnam) To thwart the U.S. and French imperialists' conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," the Vietnamese people in French-occupied areas are employing various forms of struggle to resist the French army's forced conscription and win over puppet soldiers, severely undermining the U.S. and French imperialists' plan to establish a puppet army.

In the French-occupied areas of North Vietnam, young people, in addition to joining the guerrillas to directly strike at the enemy, have launched a movement to dig secret tunnels to resist the French army's frenzied drafting. Many villages have established committees to protect young people and oppose forced conscription by the enemy, organizing inter-village alarm networks. This struggle has greatly hampered the French army's forced conscription plot. For example, in a village in Bac Ninh province, less than two kilometers from a French military stronghold, not a single young person was captured by the French army. Villagers in a certain village in Thai Binh province also used secret tunnels to fight the French army, repelling twenty-seven French army attacks, killing and wounding many French soldiers.

Young people captured by the French army seize every opportunity to join the people's guerrillas and use various methods such as refusing to fight and demanding release to struggle against the enemy. In Tien Lang district, Kien An province, seventy captured young people resolutely refused to enlist, forcing the French army to release them.

Under the influence of the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Army and the correct implementation of lenient policies by the Vietnamese government, puppet soldiers deserted or surrendered to the People's Army in platoons, companies, and even entire units. In Hung Yen province, 296 people deserted the puppet army in January and February alone. In the battle for the liberation of Hoa Binh city by the People's Army, tens of thousands of puppet soldiers deserted. In the Chi Sac area of Hai Duong province, a puppet company surrendered to the People's Army in March, bringing with them five machine guns and sixty-nine rifles. Women in the French-occupied areas also widely participated in the struggle to disintegrate the puppet army. For example, in Vinh Bao district, Kien An province, nearly a hundred families of women gathered in front of French army outposts every day, demanding the return of their husbands and sons from the French army, forcing the French army to release fifty-five Vietnamese youths.

The French aggressors are now intensifying their reign of terror over puppet soldiers. In My Hao district, Ha Nam province, the French colonialists even put shackles on the feet of puppet soldiers at night to prevent them from escaping.

### 越南人民用各种斗争方式  打击法国“以越制越”阴谋

    越南人民用各种斗争方式
    打击法国“以越制越”阴谋
    【新华社十七日讯】北越消息：越南人民为了粉碎美、法帝国主义者“利用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，正在法军占领区用各种斗争方式来反抗法军的强迫征兵，争取伪军反正，使美、法帝国主义者建立傀儡军队的计划遭到严重的打击。
    在北越法军占领区，青年们除了参加游击队直接打击敌人而外，还展开了挖掘秘密地道的运动，来反抗法军的疯狂抓丁。许多乡村成立了保卫青年、反对敌人强迫征兵的委员会，组织了各乡之间的连环警报网。这一斗争大大打击了法军的强迫征兵的阴谋。例如，在北宁省一个距法军据点不到两公里的村庄，就没有一个青年被法军抓去。太平省某村的村民们还利用秘密地道来和法军作战，打退了法军二十七次的进攻，打死打伤很多法军。
    被法军抓去的青年们一有机会就投奔人民游击队，并且用拒绝作战和要求释放等种种方法来和敌人进行斗争。在建安省先浪县，有七十名被抓去的青年坚决拒绝入伍，迫使法军释放了他们。
    在越南人民军的不断取得胜利和越南人民政府正确执行宽大政策的影响下，伪军成班成排甚至成连地逃亡或向人民军投降。在兴安省，一、二两月份内脱离伪军队伍的就有二百九十六人。在人民军解放和平城的战役中，成万的伪军开了小差。在海阳省的鸡色地方，伪军一连于三月间携带机枪五挺和步枪六十九支向人民军投诚。法军占领区中的妇女们也广泛地参加瓦解伪军的斗争。例如，在建安省永保县，近百个家庭的妇女每天都聚集在法军哨所前，向法军索取自己的丈夫和儿子，迫使法军不得不释放了五十五个越南青年。
    法国侵略者现在正加紧对伪军士兵的恐怖统治。在河南省美仁县的法国殖民者，竟在晚间把伪军士兵的脚加上脚镣，以防他们逃跑。
