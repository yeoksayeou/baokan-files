    Suggestions for Organized Exchange of Smelting Experience
    Comrade Editor: In the past half year, many administrative leading organs and industrial trade unions have held national professional meetings to summarize and promote advanced experiences. These meetings are of great significance for promoting advanced production experience nationwide and taking the production of various enterprises a step further. However, this has not been done in the smelting departments of heavy industry. Even the organization of mutual observation among factories has been poorly done. For example, although Anshan and Benxi are very close, we have not done any work in terms of technology and experience exchange. I suggest that the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry organize the exchange of smelting technical data and mutual visits among factories nationwide in the near future.

    建议有组织地交流冶炼经验
    编辑同志：近半年来，有不少的行政领导机关和产业工会，都召开了全国性的专业会议，总结和推广先进经验。这些会议，对于在全国范围内推广先进生产经验，把各企业的生产提高一步是有重大的意义的。但在重工业的冶炼部门，却没有这样做，甚至连组织各厂互相观摩也做得很差。像我们鞍山和本溪虽然距离很近，但在技术、经验交流方面，并没有做过什么工作。我建议中央重工业部钢铁工业局在最近组织全国各厂交换冶炼技术资料，并相互参观。周传典
