    Eighth Anniversary of New Poland
    Ambassador of Poland to China, Kirilo Kirilok
    Eight years have passed since that memorable day when Poland was liberated from Hitler's occupation and became a people's democratic state—July 22, 1952.
    Eight years ago, the People's Poland was born in the war against the fascist aggressors, in the disaster dyed with blood. It was reborn in the period of the Soviet army's successive victories, in those days when the forces of freedom and socialism achieved great victories against the dark forces of barbaric fascism. During World War II, Poland experienced severe disasters, and millions of people suffered. Such a scene of destruction and unparalleled suffering and sacrifice are unprecedented in our history. When only a part of Polish territory was liberated in 1944, the National Liberation Committee—later reorganized into the Provisional Government of Poland—took power. The Polish Workers' Party is the leading force in the Polish National Liberation Committee. It grew up in the excellent traditions of the Polish revolutionary workers' movement led by outstanding revolutionaries such as Dzerzhinsky and Luxembourg.
    The history of the Polish revolutionary struggle is directly related to the heroism of the people's masses led by the working class, their struggle against domestic and foreign exploiters, and their struggle for social and national liberation.
    In the struggle carried out in those years of enslavement and oppression, the Russian revolutionary workers' movement, led by the heroic Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik), was our model and inspiration.
    In the early days of our country's liberation in 1944, the memorable July Declaration pointed out the path of unity for the country's struggle for freedom and sovereignty. In accordance with the will of the people, the July Declaration called for the establishment of a people's regime, overthrowing the rule of landlords and capitalists, returning the landlords' land to the peasants, and confiscating large assets for the state. The Polish National Liberation Committee and the July Declaration called on the people of the country to liberate Poland from the shackles of foreign capitalists, and to establish the country's sovereignty and independence on the basis of a lasting alliance with the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving and peace-loving people. The Polish National Liberation Committee and the July Declaration called for consolidating Poland's borders in the Oder River, the Neisse River and the Baltic Sea, which were Poland's old territories liberated from the greedy German imperialism.
    The generation of the Polish National Liberation Committee became an epoch-making event in Polish history. According to its instructions and resolutions, revolutionary changes were carried out, ending the rule of the exploiting classes, and making the working people the masters of the country as well as their wealth and cultural equipment.
    The People's Poland took over a terrible inheritance from the dark occupation, from the rule of domestic reactionaries and foreign plunderers.
    One-third of the industry was completely destroyed by the barbaric aggressors, half of the transportation equipment was completely destroyed, one-third of the houses were razed to the ground, and two-thirds of the schools, scientific institutions, and cultural and artistic monuments were damaged.
    The capital, Warsaw, which is so dear to every Pole, became an experimental product of the invaders, who tried to raze it to the ground.
    The enemy intended to completely destroy this country. But the enemy's terror plan did not succeed. In the past eight years, our country has raised its head and grown up. We are a free country, and our strength is increasing day by day. We have laid the foundation for the further development and prosperity of the People's Poland.
    Comrade Beirut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, declared at the Seventh Plenary Session of our Party Central Committee: "Poland is no longer a poor, undefended, and helpless country. Those who want to take advantage of our weaknesses, although they gnash their teeth at us like beasts, their hopes have fallen through. Those Hitlerian remnants and other imperialists who are screaming like madmen that they want to invade our territory of the Oder and Neisse rivers are just wasting their efforts. September 1939 is gone forever, and our past shame of being helpless in the face of aggressors is also gone forever."
    In 1947, the level of industrial production in Poland was 4% higher than in 1938. This should be attributed to the nationalization of basic industries and the creative efforts of the masses.
    In 1949, the three-year plan for economic revival was completed two months ahead of schedule. This plan became the foundation for the further development of the national economy.
    As a result of the efforts of the masses of the people led by the working class, and with the significant help of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of the fraternal people's democratic countries, Poland's industrial production in 1949 was two and a half times that of the pre-war period. In 1950, our country began a great struggle to win the victorious completion of the Six-Year Plan—a plan for national welfare and happiness.
    The fundamental basis of the Six-Year Plan is: to expand industry, especially the means of industrial production, as a basic tool for changing the entire national economy; to reform the economy on the basis of new large-scale industrial technology; to suppress capitalist elements in urban and rural areas in sharp and irreconcilable class struggles; to change small-scale primitive farming in rural areas into production cooperatives under the principle of voluntary reform, on the one hand, the state vigorously helps individual small and medium-sized farming, while further universally developing state-owned farms and state-owned machinery stations.
    At the same time, the task of the Six-Year Plan is to improve the welfare and cultural level of the broad masses of the people, and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation with the great Soviet state and the people's democratic countries.
    The struggle to complete the Six-Year Plan is the struggle to establish a strong, prosperous and happy socialist Poland, and the struggle to strengthen the world camp of freedom and peace.
    Now we have completed the third year of the Six-Year Plan. Our country has completed the production scheduled to be completed in 1953 in the Six-Year Plan. This year, the production volume of each person will increase four times compared with before the war.
    Capitalist factors in industry have been eliminated, and by the end of 1951, socialist industry accounted for 99.4% of the total value of production.
    Socialist construction—1,500 new industrial buildings are constantly under construction.
    The capital of People's Poland—Warsaw will be completely rebuilt in 1955, together with those beautiful and well-lit homes for the working people. Surrounded by parks and with a magnificent subway, Warsaw will become our great socialist capital.
    Throughout the country, new cities are growing. For example, Nowa Huta, which has a magnificent modern combined smelter. The steel produced in these factories will be more than twice the total output of the pre-war steel industry.
    A new city of steelworkers and miners—Tychy—will appear in the coal-producing area.
    On the basis of national industrialization, Poland's underdeveloped countryside has also developed. We have organized 3,362 production cooperatives, 13,000 villages have been electrified, the number of tractors has reached 40,000, we have 45,000 sowing machines, 50,000 harvesters and 27,000 weeders.
    At the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Chairman Beirut of the Central Committee mentioned the Party's task of further realizing the magnificent Six-Year Plan, saying: "We must unite the national strength to transform Poland's backward and weakest economy in Europe into one of the strongest economies in Europe led by technology in the shortest possible time. Unite the national strength to transform the semi-agricultural country into an industrial country, a country of steel and cement, a country of machinery and electricity, a country with highly technological industries and agriculture, a country that fully utilizes its huge natural resources, a country with economic and cultural unity, a country with huge metallurgical and chemical industries, a country with developed shipping and world ports, and a country with bumper harvests and high technology."
    On the basis of national development and full employment, the welfare and cultural level of the masses of the people have been continuously improved, and the consumption of food and cloth has increased significantly.
    A great cultural revolution is spreading throughout the country. The draft of the new constitution of the Polish People's Republic has been discussed and passed. It further expands the revolutionary achievements of the masses of the people. The constitution states: "Citizens of the Republic of Poland have the right to study." Now we have victoriously completed the task of eliminating illiteracy. Illiteracy is a sad legacy of capitalist Poland. In 1931, a quarter of adults were illiterate. Today, all school-age children are enrolled in school. In the Poland of landlords and capitalists, one million school-age children were out of school. Now, children of workers and peasants account for 70% of all students in secondary and higher education institutions. More books have been published in the seven years that the people have been in power than in the twenty years of capitalist rule. Social welfare is very important: social insurance has benefited all working people, and the country is full of sanatoriums, nursing homes, hospitals and clinics, where working people can receive free medical treatment. The health care for mothers and children is widely developed. The Constitution of the Polish People's Republic declares that all citizens have the right to enjoy cultural achievements and actively participate in national cultural construction. The creativity of our people is developing unprecedentedly, and the artistic creation movement has a mass character. The cultural development of all people's democratic countries proves Comrade Stalin's brilliant theory: "Socialist countries are much more united and stronger than any bourgeois country, and much more popular. The culture of these countries—socialist content and national form, is much deeper than the culture of bourgeois countries." Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party, under the guidance of Comrade Beirut, our country is moving towards transforming into a socialist country.
    Comrade Beirut said at the Seventh Plenary Session: "Let us reiterate our oath: if we do not link the struggle to defend peace with our daily work, if we separate the task of defending peace from the struggle to implement our Six-Year Plan, the struggle to defend peace will be empty, turning into empty talk or powerless appeasement.
    Countries can unite, organize, and constantly strengthen their material strength and defensive means to resist and dispel the plots of imperialist aggressors to infringe upon their independence, so as to defend peace."
    The great construction carried out in our country is based on obtaining extensive assistance from the Soviet Union in economy and culture.
    Soviet socialists: workers, engineers and experts help us in industrial construction, help us build subways, build the magnificent Palace of Science and Culture—a gift from the Soviet Union to the Polish people. All this shows the fraternal relationship and inseparable unity between our two countries, and the permanent and immortal friendship between the great Soviet state and Poland.
    At the same time, Poland has established the closest ties with all people's democratic countries, with the great Chinese people, and with the heroic Korean people. Poland is proud to have the strong and invincible Chinese people, under the leadership of the great theoretical thinker and leader of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong, in the big family of freedom-loving and peace-loving countries.
    Poland will forever strengthen its friendship and cooperation with the Chinese people. The liberation of the Chinese people opened a new era in the history of the Asian people.
    Under the leadership of the great and invincible Soviet Union—the main pillar of peace and freedom for the people of the world—under the leadership of the greatest figure in our historical era, the standard-bearer of peace, the great Stalin, with the friendship and cooperation of all people's democratic countries and freedom-loving and peace-loving countries, we will fight against imperialism. Our country will take up the cause of defending peace and defend it to the end.
    Peace will surely defeat war.

    波兰新生八周年
    波兰驻华大使　基里洛克
    自波兰从希特勒占领下获得解放而成为人民民主国家的可纪念的那一天，到现在——一九五二年七月二十二日，已过了八个年头了。
    八年前，人民的波兰在反对法西斯侵略者的战争中，在血染的灾难中诞生。它在苏军节节胜利的时期，在自由与社会主义力量对抗野蛮的法西斯主义的黑暗势力取得伟大胜利的那些日子里获得新生。在第二次世界大战期间，波兰历经了严重的灾难，成百万的人民受到灾害。这种毁灭的景象以及无比的苦难和牺牲，在我们的历史中是没有先例的。当
    一九四四年仅有一部分波兰国土获得解放的时候，民族解放委员会——后来改组成波兰临时政府——便掌握了政权。波兰工人党在波兰民族解放委员会中是领导的力量。它是在曾由捷尔任斯基、卢森堡等出色革命家所领导的波兰革命工人运动的优良传统中成长起来的。
    波兰革命斗争的历史是和以工人阶级为首的人民大众的英雄气概，以他们反对国内外剥削者的斗争和争取社会与国家解放的奋斗直接相联系的。
    在那些被奴役与被压迫的年月里进行的斗争中，以英雄的苏联共产党（布）为首的俄国革命工人运动是我们典范和鼓舞的力量。
    在一九四四年我国解放的初期，那可纪念的七月宣言就已指出国家为自由与主权而斗争的团结道路。七月宣言按照全国人民的意志，号召建立人民的政权，推翻地主与资本家的统治，把地主的土地交还农民，没收大资产为国有。波兰民族解放委员会和七月宣言号召全国人民把波兰从外国资本家的枷锁中解放出来，把国家的主权和独立建立在与苏联和所有爱好自由与和平的人民的恒久联盟的基础上。波兰民族解放委员会和七月宣言号召巩固波兰在奥得河、尼斯河和波罗的海的疆界，这些是从贪婪的德国帝国主义解放出来的波兰旧领土。
    波兰民族解放委员会的产生成为波兰历史上划时代的事情。根据它的指示和决议进行了革命的变革，结束了剥削阶级的统治，使劳动人民当了国家以及他们的财富与文化设备的主人。
    人民的波兰从黑暗的占领，从国内反动派和国外掠夺者的统治下，接管了一份可怕的遗产。
    三分之一的工业完全被野蛮的侵略者所摧毁了，一半的运输设备被彻底破坏，三分之一的住宅被夷平，三分之二的学校、科学机构和文化艺术纪念物遭受到破坏。
    对每一个波兰人都是如此亲切的首都——华沙，变成了侵略者的试验品，他们极力要把它夷为平地。
    敌人打算把这个国家彻底摧毁。但是敌人的恐怖计划并未能成功。在过去八年中，我们的国家抬起了头并且成长起来。我们是一个自由的国家，而且我们的力量日益加强，我们奠定了人民波兰进一步发展和繁荣的条件。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特同志在我党中央委员会第七届全体会议上宣称：“波兰已不是贫困的，没有防御的，没有办法的国家了，这些都是过去的情形了。那些想利用我们弱点的人们，尽管像野兽似地对我们咬牙切齿，但是他们的希望落了空了。那些像疯子一样叫嚷着想侵夺我国奥得河和尼斯河的领土的希特勒主义馀孽以及其他的帝国主义不过是白费力气而已。一九三九年九月已一去不复返了，我们过去在侵略者面前毫无办法的耻辱也一去不复返了。”
    在一九四七年，波兰的工业生产水平已比一九三八年高出了百分之四。这应归功于基本工业国有化和群众创造性的努力。
    在一九四九年，经济复兴三年计划提前两个月完成。这个计划成了国家经济进一步发展的根基。
    由于以工人阶级为首的人民群众的努力的结果，并得力于苏联的显著帮助以及各兄弟人民民主国家的合作，波兰在一九四九年的工业生产已为战前的两倍半。在一九五○年，我们的国家开始了争取胜利完成六年计划——国家福利和幸福的计划——的伟大斗争。
    六年计划的根本基础是：扩展工业，特别是工业生产手段，作为改变整个国家经济的基本工具；在崭新的大工业技术的基础上改革经济；在尖锐的不调和的阶级斗争中抑制城乡中的资本主义因素；在自愿改革的原则下改变乡村中小规模的原始耕作为生产合作社，一方面由国家大力帮助个人的中小规模耕作，同时进一步普遍发展国营农场和国营机械站。
    同时，六年计划的任务是提高广大人民大众的福利和文化水平，加强与伟大苏维埃国家和人民民主国家的经济和文化合作。
    为争取完成六年计划的斗争就是为争取建立一个强大、富裕和幸福的社会主义波兰的斗争，就是加强世界自由和平阵营的斗争。
    现在我们已完成六年计划中第三年的部分。我们国家已完成了六年计划中预定在一九五三年完成的生产。在今年每一个人的生产量将比战前增加四倍。
    工业中的资本主义因素已予消除，一九五一年底社会主义工业在生产总值中已占到百分之九九·四。
    社会主义建设——有一千五百个新的工业建筑经常在进行中。
    人民波兰的首都——华沙在一九五五年将完全重建起来，连同那些美丽的、光线充足的劳动人民住宅。四周公园环绕，还有壮丽的地下铁道，华沙将成为我国伟大的社会主义首都。
    在全国，新的城市在成长。例如诺伐·胡塔，它有一个宏伟的现代化的联合冶炼厂。这些工厂中钢的产量将超过战前全部炼钢工业产量的两倍。
    在产煤区中将出现一个炼钢工人和矿工的新城市——狄基。
    在国家工业化的基础上，波兰还未充分发展的乡村也已发展起来了。我们已组织了三、三六二个生产合作社，一万三千个乡村已电气化，拖拉机的数目已达到四万架，我们有四万五千架播种机，五万架收割机和两万七千架除草机。
    在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七届全体会议中，中央委员会主席贝鲁特提到党对进一步实现宏伟的六年计划的任务说：“必须团结全国力量，在最短时间内把落后的和欧洲最薄弱的波兰的经济转变为以技术为先导的、欧洲最强盛的经济之一。团结全国力量以便把半农业的国家转变为工业国家、钢铁和水泥的国家、机器和电气的国家、工业和农业高度技术化的国家、充分利用其埋藏着的巨大自然财富的国家、经济和文化统一的国家、拥有庞大冶金和化学工业的国家、海运发达和拥有世界港口的国家、丰收和高度技术的国家。”
    在国家发展和全部就业的基础上，人民大众的福利和文化水平不断提高，食物和布疋的消费量有显著的增加。
    一个伟大的文化革命普及全国。波兰人民共和国的新宪法草案经过讨论后通过了。它进一步扩大人民大众的革命成果。宪法上说：“波兰共和国的公民有学习的权利。”现在我们已胜利地完成了肃清文盲的工作。文盲是资本主义波兰的可悲的遗产，在一九三一年有四分之一的成人是不识字的。今天所有学龄儿童都已入学了。在地主和资本家的波兰，有一百万学龄儿童失学。现在在中等和高等学校中工农子弟占了全部学生的百分之七十。人民掌握政权的七年中所出版的书籍比资本主义统治的二十年所出版的还要多。社会福利是非常重要的：社会保险使全体劳动人民受到了好处，全国布满了休养所、疗养院、医院和诊疗所，劳动人民可以获得免费医药治疗。对于母亲和儿童的保健事业广泛发展。波兰人民共和国宪法宣告所有公民有权利享受文化成就以及活跃地参加国家文化建设。我国人民的创造力是史无前例地发展着，艺术的创作运动具有群众性的特色。所有人民民主国家的文化发展证明了斯大林同志的天才理论：“社会主义国家比任何资产阶级国家更团结坚强好多倍，更有全民性好多倍。这些国家的文化——社会主义的内容和民族的形式，比资产阶级国家的文化深邃得多。”我们的国家在马克思列宁主义的党的领导下，在贝鲁特同志的指导下，正在走向转变为一个社会主义国家的道路。
    贝鲁特同志在七中全会中说过：“再申述我们的誓言：如果我们不把保卫和平的斗争和我们的日常工作联系起来，如果我们把保卫和平的任务和为实行我们六年计划而进行的斗争分割开来，保卫和平的斗争便会是悬空的，变成了空言或者无力的绥靖主义。
    各国可以团结起来，组织起来，不断加强他们的物质力量和防御手段，以抵抗和打消帝国主义侵略者侵犯他们独立的图谋，这样去保卫和平。”
    在我们国家中实行的伟大建设是以取得苏联在经济和文化上的广泛帮助为基础的。
    苏联社会主义者：工人、工程师和专家帮助我们进行工业建设，帮助我们建设地下铁道，建设壮丽的科学文化宫——苏联给予波兰人民的礼物，所有这一切都表示我们两国间的兄弟关系和不可分的团结，表示伟大的苏维埃国家和波兰的永久不灭的友谊。
    波兰同时和所有人民民主国家，和伟大的中国人民，和英雄的朝鲜人民，建立了最亲密的联系。波兰因为在爱好自由与和平的国家的大家庭中，有在伟大理论思想家和中国革命领袖毛泽东领导下的强盛的、不可战胜的中国人民而感到骄傲。
    波兰将永远加强与中国人民的友谊和合作。中国人民的解放打开了亚洲人民历史的新纪元。
    在伟大的、不可战胜的苏联——全世界人民和平与自由的主要支柱——的领导下，在我们历史时代最伟大的人物、和平的旗手、伟大的斯大林的领导下，得到所有人民民主国家和爱好自由与和平国家的友谊与合作，我们将与帝国主义进行斗争。我们的国家将会把保卫和平事业担当起来，而且保卫到底。
    和平必将战胜战争。
