Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: China's democratic parties have successively issued written statements or declarations, protesting the serious provocative incident of American planes intruding into China's airspace, indiscriminately strafing, killing and wounding 49 Chinese people, and supporting the statement made by China's Foreign Minister Zhou on the 12th of this month.

    The statement of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said: The provocative incident created by American planes in Andong, Northeast China, on July 11th, is intolerable to all Chinese people and will certainly be hated by all peace-loving people in the world! We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. Due to the continuous provocative acts of direct aggression against the Chinese people by the American aggressors, an even more serious situation has been created in the Far East, thereby seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people, who have stood up, must unite with the broad masses of people all over the world to jointly combat the aggressors. Peace will surely triumph over war.
    The spokesperson of the headquarters of the China Democratic League issued a written statement saying: The serious provocative incident created by American planes in Andong, Northeast China, is the largest incident since February 29th of this year in which the American invading Korean air force has repeatedly intruded into the airspace of Northeast China, continuously bombing and strafing our peaceful residents, causing deaths and injuries. This fully proves that the aggressive ambitions of the American imperialists are endless, and they are determined to be enemies with the peace-loving Chinese people to the end. The China Democratic League fully supports the solemn protest made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on July 12th against American imperialism. The Chinese people have exercised great patience over the past year in striving for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. We have exercised great patience in striving for peace in the Far East and the world. Today, we solemnly warn American imperialism that the tolerance of our 500 million Chinese people towards aggressors is limited. We are determined to defend the sacred territory of our motherland.
    The statement of the China Democratic National Construction Association said: The serious provocative incident of American planes intruding into our airspace in Andong, Northeast China, and indiscriminately strafing fully demonstrates that the American aggressors are deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations and plotting to expand the war of aggression. We feel boundless anger towards its provocation; we firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest, and hope that all members of our association will heighten their vigilance, continue to contribute their strength, support the front lines, and stop the American imperialists' plot to expand the war.
    The spokesperson of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a statement saying: The Korean armistice negotiations are at a critical juncture due to the American imperialists' repeated obstruction and interference. At the same time, the American imperialists have carried out a series of serious provocative acts against the Chinese people. It has been fully proven by facts that the American imperialists are deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations, attempting to expand the war of aggression, and threatening peace in Asia. The Chinese people are all无比愤怒 (unusually angry) about this. We are closely watching the current changes in the situation and firmly support the statement made by our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai on the 12th: "The American government's provocative acts of direct aggression against the Chinese people have already created a more serious situation in the Far East. The American government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this serious situation."
    The spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a written statement saying: The atrocities committed by American planes in the airspace of Northeast China have once again proved that the American aggressors have become so疯狂 (crazy) as to be beyond compare in order to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party fully supports the solemn protest made by our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government against the American planes' intrusion into our airspace. And solemnly warns the American aggressors that the American government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this atrocity.
    The spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement saying: The Chinese people will never be moved by any provocation or intimidation from the American aggressors. Any damage inflicted on our compatriots by the American imperialists must be settled with the American war-mongers one by one in the future. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on July 12th and call on compatriots across the country to contend with the American imperialists to the end, and we will never stop until the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and achieving world peace is achieved.
    The spokesperson of the Jiusan Society issued a written statement saying: We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. And call on all members and cultural, educational, and scientific workers across the country to unanimously condemn the provocative acts of the American aggressors against our people time and time again. At a time when the Korean armistice negotiations have reached the most important juncture, this series of provocative acts by the American aggressors shows that the armistice negotiations are nothing more than a smokescreen for the American war-mongers to prepare for expanding the war of aggression. All peace-loving people in the world, including the American people, must further unite to crush this war plot of American imperialism and strive for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue.
    The spokesperson of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement saying: The atrocities committed by the aircraft of the American aggressors in Andong, Northeast China, are a direct provocation against our country and a threat and harm to the people of the world. This is an extremely shameless means by which the American aggressors fear peace and therefore want to obstruct peace. However, the Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate it. We fully support the solemn statement of our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai. All the atrocities of the American aggressors will be subject to just sanctions by the people of China and the world!
    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: People's organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued written statements, strongly protesting the atrocities of American planes intruding into China's airspace and killing and wounding Chinese people, and supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement protesting the provocative acts of American planes. The statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The Chinese working class expresses无比 (unusually) anger at this狂妄 (arrogant) provocative act by the American aggressors. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on July 12th and lodge a serious protest with the American aggressors. We accuse the working class and working people of the world of this atrocity by the American imperialists, and we will never allow American planes to arbitrarily invade the airspace of our sacred motherland. We warn the American imperialists that this狂妄 (arrogant) provocative act of yours will inevitably eat its own bitter fruit and will be subjected to just punishment by the peace-loving people of the world.
    The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said: The atrocities of the American aggressors recently invading the airspace of Northeast China, indiscriminately strafing, and killing and wounding the people of our country fully prove that the American government is deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations and expanding the war of aggression in an attempt to threaten peace in the Far East and Asia. We represent all the women of China in lodging a serious protest with the American government.
    The joint statement issued by the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation said: The serious provocative act of the American aggressors on July 11th cannot but arouse the无比 (unusual) anger of the people and youth of our country. We, on behalf of the youth and students of the country, resolutely support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on July 12th, and express serious protest against the shameless provocative acts of the American aggressors. This卑鄙 (despicable) act of the United States, which is deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations, expanding the war of aggression, and attempting to threaten peace in the Far East and the world, cannot escape its due criminal responsibility and will be subject to a just trial!

    【新华社十四日讯】我国各民主党派纷纷发表书面谈话或声明，抗议美国飞机侵犯我国领空，滥施扫射，打死打伤我国人民四十九人的严重挑衅事件，并拥护我国周外长本月十二日的声明。
    中国国民党革命委员会的声明说：七月十一日美国飞机在我东北安东制造的挑衅事件，是全中国人民所不能容忍的，也必为全世界爱好和平人民所切齿痛恨！我们完全拥护周恩来外长的声明。由于美国侵略者接连不断地对于中国人民进行直接侵略的挑衅行为，业已造成了远东更加严重的局势，从而使亚洲和全世界和平更受到严重的威胁。站起来了的中国人民，一定要和全世界广大人民团结起来，共同打击侵略者。和平一定战胜战争。
    中国民主同盟总部发言人发表书面谈话说：美国飞机在我国东北安东制造的严重的挑衅事件，是美国侵朝空军从本年二月二十九日以来历次侵入我国东北领空不断进行轰炸扫射我和平居民造成死伤人数最大的一次。这完全证明美帝国主义者的侵略野心是绝无止境的，他居心要和爱好和平的中国人民为敌到底。中国民主同盟完全拥护我周恩来外长七月十二日对美帝国主义所提的严重抗议。中国人民这一年来用了极大的忍耐争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们用了极大的忍耐争取远东和全世界的和平。我们今天严正地向美帝国主义警告，我中国五万万人民对侵略者的容忍是有限度的。我们对保卫祖国神圣的领土是有决心的。
    中国民主建国会的声明说：美国飞机侵入我东北安东领空滥施扫射的严重挑衅事件，充分说明了美国侵略者蓄意破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵略战争。我们对于它的挑衅，感到无比的愤怒；我们坚决拥护周外长的严重抗议，并希望我会全体会员提高警惕，继续贡献力量，支援前线，制止美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋。

    中国农工民主党中央委员会发言人发表书面谈话说：美国飞机在我国东北领空制造的暴行，又一次证明了美国侵略者为了破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大侵略战争，已疯狂到无以复加的程度了。中国农工民主党完全拥护我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长对于美机侵犯我国领空的严重抗议。并郑重警告美国侵略者，由此暴行而产生的一切后果，应由美国政府负完全责任。

    台湾民主自治同盟发言人发表声明说：美国侵略者飞机在我国东北安东制造的暴行，是直接对我国的挑衅，也是对全世界人民的威胁与危害，这是美国侵略者惧怕和平因而想阻挠和平的极其无耻的手段。然而站起来了的中国人民是绝不能容忍的。我们完全拥护我国外交部周恩来部长的严正声明。美国侵略者的一切暴行都将受到全中国和全世界人民正义的制裁！
