Xinhua News Agency, London, July 15th: The "Workers' Daily" reports that the National Executive Committee of the British Women's Co-operative Guild has written to British Prime Minister Churchill, protesting the American bombing of the Yalu River power plants and urgently demanding an end to the Korean War.

The letter points out that the American bombing of the Yalu River power plants has further increased the dissatisfaction of Britain and other countries with American policy in Korea. The letter requests the British government to "put forward proposals, through the United Nations or by other means, that clearly express Britain's urgent desire to end the Korean War."

The National Executive Committee of the Women's Co-operative Guild requests the government to "make those involved in the armistice negotiations understand that the British people - many of whom have children serving in the forces fighting in Korea - want to achieve an agreement at any cost."

    英国妇女要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：“工人日报”报道：英国妇女合作协会全国执行委员会写信给英国首相邱吉尔，抗议美国轰炸鸭绿江发电厂，并迫切要求停止朝鲜战争。
    信中指出，美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂使英国及其他国家对美国在朝鲜的政策不满的情绪进一步增长。信中要求英国政府“通过联合国或以其他方法提出足以明确表示英国迫切希望停止朝鲜战争的建议”。
    妇女合作协会全国执行委员会请求政府“使参与停战谈判的人们了解英国人民——他们之中许多人都有孩子参加在朝鲜作战的部队——希望不惜以任何力量获致协议”。
