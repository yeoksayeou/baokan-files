    Support the Instruction of Publicly Funded Medical Care and Prevention
    Editor's Note: Since the Government Administration Council issued the instruction on implementing publicly funded medical care and prevention for national staff members of all levels of people's governments, parties, organizations, and their affiliated institutions nationwide, our newspaper has received many letters from readers. They unanimously expressed their warm welcome to this instruction from the Government Administration Council and sincerely thanked the People's Government for its care for the national staff members. Below are two of the letters:

    Editor: Just as the motherland is carrying out large-scale economic construction and supporting the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the People's Government has allocated a large amount of funds to protect our health. This shows that the Party and Chairman Mao are caring for us like a loving mother at all times. We ourselves must pay attention to our health at all times and in all places to repay Chairman Mao's care for us.
    Beijing University Gu Xiangzeng

    Editor: The instruction on publicly funded medical care and prevention has been warmly welcomed by all staff members of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, greatly boosting our work enthusiasm. Staff members of our bank generally believe that the implementation of this great measure not only demonstrates the infinite care of our leader Chairman Mao and the People's Government for our national staff members but also proves the superiority of the New Democratic society.

    Since our bank switched to the salary system, the living standards of the cadres have greatly improved. However, some cadres still had a mental concern: fearing that they would not have money to treat illnesses. After the instruction on publicly funded medical care and prevention was issued, this concern no longer exists. Everyone believes that the People's Government cares for us so meticulously that we have no reason not to work wholeheartedly. Zhao Kun

    拥护公费医疗预防的指示
    编者按：自从政务院关于全国各级人民政府、党派、团体及所属事业单位的国家工作人员实行公费医疗预防的指示发表后，本报曾收到许多读者来信，他们一致表示对政务院这一指示热烈欢迎，并衷心感谢人民政府对国家工作人员的关怀，下面是其中的两封信：
    编辑同志：正当祖国进行大规模经济建设，支援抗美援朝的时候，人民政府又拨出大批的经费来保护我们的健康。这说明党和毛主席时时刻刻都像慈母一般地在关怀着我们。我们自己更要随时随地注意身体健康，以报答毛主席对我们的关怀。

    编辑同志：公费医疗预防的指示得到了我们中国人民银行北京分行的全体职工的热烈欢迎，大大地鼓舞了我们的工作热情。我行工作人员普遍认为，这一伟大措施的实行，不但表现了我们的领袖毛主席和人民政府对于我们国家工作人员的无限关怀，同时也证明了新民主主义社会的优越性。
    我行自改为薪金制以后，干部们的生活水平都大大地提高了一步，但是有些干部还有一个思想顾虑，怕害病没有钱治疗。公费医疗预防的指示发表后，这个顾虑就不存在了，大家都认为：人民政府这样无微不至地关怀我们，我们没有任何理由不安心工作了。    赵昆
