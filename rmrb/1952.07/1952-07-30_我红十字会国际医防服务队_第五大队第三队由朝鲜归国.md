    Our Red Cross International Medical and Disease Prevention Service Team
    Fifth Detachment, Third Team Returns from Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 27th] The 28 members of the Third Team and nurse team of the Fifth Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Disease Prevention Service Team, who served on the Korean front, have now completed their mission and, led by Detachment Leader Chen Minshu, victoriously returned to China from the Korean front on the 17th of this month. This team was composed of the First Surgical Team and nurse team of the Zhejiang Volunteer Medical Brigade. Since going to Korea last July, all comrades have displayed a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism. Under the circumstances of material difficulties in the Korean battlefield, they used their brains to find solutions and overcame many difficulties. For example, physician Zhang Shiqin used a duodenal tube to modify a gastrointestinal suction device, solving the difficulty of lacking a gastrointestinal decompression device and improving the treatment effect of abdominal injuries. X-ray technician Yang Chunfa modified the protective motor and the AC rolling plate, saving two pounds of gasoline per hour. Nurses Wu Dezhen, Huang Xianhua, Wang Ying, and others consistently actively cared for the wounded, eliminating medical accidents in nursing. They bravely chipped ice to get water to wash dressings in the freezing cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius in winter, thus earning glorious merit. They even donated their own blood to treat the sick and wounded. All staff members also participated in repairing roads and bridges and assisting the Korean people with the autumn harvest and chopping firewood during their spare time.

    我红十字会国际医防服务队
    第五大队第三队由朝鲜归国
    【新华社二十七日讯】在朝鲜前线服务的中国红十字会国际医防服务队第五大队第三队和护士队二十八人，现已完成任务，由大队长陈敏书率领，在本月十七日从朝鲜前线胜利归国。该队是由浙江志愿医疗大队第一手术队和护士队组成。自去年七月去朝鲜后，全体同志发挥了高度的爱国主义、国际主义和革命人道主义精神，在朝鲜战地物质困难的情况下，开动脑筋想办法，克服了很多困难。如医师章士勤利用十二指肠管改装肠胃管吸引器，解决了缺少胃肠减压器的困难，并且提高了腹部伤员的治疗效果。X光技术员杨春法改装了护电机、交流电的滚盘，每小时节省汽油二磅。护士吴德桢、黄仙华、王瑛等一贯积极地护理伤员，消灭护理上的医疗事故。她们在冬天零下三十度的冰天雪地中敲冰取水洗敷料，因而光荣地立了功。他们甚至输出自己的血液为伤病员治疗。全体工作人员在工作空暇还参加抢修公路、桥梁和协助朝鲜人民秋收、砍木柴等劳动。
