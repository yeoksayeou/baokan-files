    Instructions on "Continuing to Implement the Marriage Law"
    In the winter of 1951, various localities, in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law," conducted a major inspection. Many places have begun to attach importance to the implementation of the Marriage Law. However, during the "Three-Anti" movement, many places neglected the implementation of the Marriage Law, relaxing or abandoning leadership. As a result, deaths have occurred successively since the beginning of spring and have gradually increased. For example, in eight counties in the northern Sichuan area, there were 116 murder cases and 56 assault cases caused by marriage disputes from January to April. In the Liaocheng area of ​​Pingyuan Province, 56 women have committed suicide or been killed due to marriage problems since the beginning of spring.
    The State Council instructed that: "Serious legal measures must be taken to punish those who cause deaths due to interference with freedom of marriage. People's governments at all levels should immediately conduct inspections of such cases of injury, abuse, or forced suicide of women that have already occurred. Those who have been sentenced should be investigated and dealt with according to law if there are errors. Those who have not been dealt with must be strictly investigated and punished according to law, so that every criminal receives due punishment." Various localities should report the implementation situation truthfully and in detail.
    The State Council instructed that: "Cadres who condone or shield criminals, or interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women, thereby promoting the killing or suicide of women, should be given due punishment according to the severity of their responsibility. In the future, if any woman is killed or commits suicide because she does not receive the rights and protection granted by the Marriage Law due to marriage problems, the main cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels should bear certain responsibilities first." Various localities should also report the implementation situation truthfully and in detail.
    The State Council instructed that: "People's governments at all levels must regard the implementation of the Marriage Law and the ideological education of cadres and the people as a regular and major political task for a considerable period of time... and earnestly carry it out as far as possible in conjunction with the central tasks such as local land reform and democratic political construction." Among the people's governments at all levels, the county level is particularly important. However, judging from the current situation, some leaders above the county level pay little attention to it. Some fail to regularly educate, guide, supervise, and inspect the district and township cadres, resulting in the residual feudal ideas of some district and township cadres not being severely criticized, and the bureaucratic and coercive command styles not being corrected. Illegal acts of interfering with the freedom of marriage of men and women have not been stopped; some mistakenly believe that the implementation of the Marriage Law is contradictory to other central tasks and have not earnestly carried it out in conjunction with the central tasks such as local land reform and democratic political construction. Facts have proved that the elimination of the feudal ideology of district and township cadres is the main key to whether the Marriage Law can be implemented among the masses, and whether district and township cadres can implement the Marriage Law and the quality of its implementation depends critically on whether the leaders above the county level attach importance to it.
    Various localities should conduct inspections immediately in accordance with this instruction and summarize the results of the inspections and report them to the ministry. People's representative conferences at all levels and their consultative committees or standing committees must, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, report and discuss the implementation of the Marriage Law during meetings, and report the results of the discussions to higher levels.

### 中央人民政府内务部、司法部  关于“继续贯彻婚姻法”的指示

    中央人民政府内务部、司法部
    关于“继续贯彻婚姻法”的指示
    一九五一年冬，各地依照政务院“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”，进行了一次大检查。许多地方对婚姻法的贯彻已开始重视。但在“三反”运动中，不少地方又忽视了婚姻法的贯彻，放松或放弃了领导。因之，入春以来，死人的现象又陆续发生，并逐渐增加。例如川北区八个县一至四月份因婚姻纠纷而引起的杀害案件一百一十六件，伤害案五十六件；平原省聊城专区入春以来因婚姻问题自杀与被杀的妇女已达五十六人。
    政务院指示说：对于因干涉婚姻自由而造成的人命案件，必须“采取严肃的法律手段，予以制裁。各级人民政府对于这种已经发生的伤害、虐杀妇女或逼致妇女自杀的案件，应即进行检查。已判者，如有错误，应予查明，依法处理，未办者，必须严加追究，依法制裁，务使每个犯罪者都受到应有的惩处。”各地即应将执行情况，切实具报。
    政务院指示说：“干部中如有宽纵、袒护罪犯，或干涉男女婚姻自由因而促成妇女被杀或自杀者，应按责任轻重，予以应得的处分。今后如有妇女因婚姻问题得不到婚姻法所赋予的权利与保护而被杀或自杀者，区、乡（村）、街级的主要干部，首先应负一定责任。”各地亦应将执行情况，切实具报。
    政务院指示说：“各级人民政府一方面必须把贯彻婚姻法的执行和对于干部与人民的思想教育，当作相当长时期内经常的重大政治任务，……尽可能结合当地土地改革、民主建政等中心工作切实进行。”在各级人民政府中，尤以县一级更为重要。然而就目前情况来看，有些县以上的领导人注意很差，有的由于对区、乡干部经常进行教育、指导、督促检查不够，致某些区、乡干部中的封建思想的残余，没有受到严厉批判，官僚主义与强迫命令作风没有得到纠正，干涉男女婚姻自由的非法行为没有得到制止；有的错误地认为贯彻婚姻法和其他中心工作是矛盾的，没有结合当地土地改革、民主建政等中心工作切实进行。事实证明：区、乡干部的封建思想的肃清，是婚姻法能否贯彻到群众中去的主要关键，而区、乡干部能否执行婚姻法和执行的好坏，关键决定于县以上的领导人能否重视。
    各地应即根据本指示进行检查，并将检查结果总结报部。各级人民代表会议及其协商委员会或常务委员会在开会时，必须依照政务院指示，将婚姻法的贯彻与执行，进行报告、讨论，并将讨论结果逐级上报。            七月二十五日
