Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd. Joliot-Curie delivered a speech at the first meeting of the World Peace Council Special Session held on the 1st.

This Special Session Will Formulate the Best Ways to Solve the Problems That Divide Humanity Today.

Joliot-Curie said: The serious events of recent months have prompted the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, which met in Oslo on April 1, to convene this special session to study what peaceful means can be used to resolve the problems that divide humanity today, and what are the best ways to implement these means.

The recent decisions regarding Germany and Japan, the difficulties encountered in concluding the Korean armistice agreement, and the use of biological weapons all clearly indicate that the international situation has further deteriorated. This gives our meeting a significance that we all fully realize.

At a special meeting like ours, it is not enough to simply make resolutions, even if these resolutions are the best. We must also study and find the best ways to implement these resolutions. We must attract people to participate in this work – attract the millions of men and women who sent us to our last congress, attract all those who have joined our ranks since the last congress, attract all those who want peace, even if they may be far from us at present.

Joliot-Curie, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, proposed convening a World Peace Congress at the end of this year to fully exchange views on the most important issues in the struggle for peace.

In the process of preparing for this congress, all those who now feel the danger of war, all those who want peace, must study our proposals and try to put forward new proposals. In the process of trying to correctly estimate the problems and the importance of the actions to be taken, they will gain a conviction, the strength of which will enable anyone to spread the positive will to strive for peace.

In this way, the millions of men and women who have not yet joined our movement will take action to defend peace, without whose support peace cannot be saved.

We can only implement these decisions if we persuade the vast majority of citizens of all countries to work together to insist on resolving the problems that divide the world through just and peaceful means.

The power of public opinion awakened by the peace movement has already been demonstrated: the Stockholm Declaration prevented the use of atomic bombs in Asia.

I should remind everyone that when the United Nations last held its general assembly in Paris, we, meeting in Vienna, emphasized the issue of disarmament, which was mentioned in the letter to the United Nations passed by the Warsaw Congress. Public opinion expressed its views in the most diverse ways, so much so that the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Padilla Nervo, felt compelled to tell the delegation of the World Peace Council that it was important for public opinion to express its views forcefully in order to guide the United Nations' activities effectively for peace.

At that United Nations General Assembly, we were also able to hand over the resolutions of our Vienna meeting to the representatives of all countries in the United Nations. Many delegations were received by representatives of major countries, and we dare to say without distorting the facts that this pressure played a significant role in organizing the United Nations Disarmament Commission. The task of this committee is to meet two basic requirements: to eliminate the threat of weapons of mass destruction and to obtain a decision on universal and controlled disarmament. On June 15, the Disarmament Commission submitted its first report to the Security Council, which was very disappointing. This is because public opinion is not vigilant and active enough, which shows what work we must do.

In the past few months, we all could see that some people were trying to spread the opinion that the only possible solution now is to rely on force, and the only way out is to organize an army large enough to force others to obey or accept one's own will through war. No concessions, no appeasement.

But there is also another opinion emerging, which is slowly but steadily taking hold in the minds of millions of people, namely, the opinion that negotiations should be used to solve problems, in contrast to the opinion that force should be used to solve problems.

People's ardent demand for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact of the kind we proposed in this city (Berlin - editor's note), and the extensive discussion caused by the movement to collect signatures for the declaration for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact (which enabled everyone to understand the meaning of the declaration and its full importance), prove that armed conflict is by no means inevitable, and that all problems and all contradictions can be resolved through negotiation.

We are convinced that by doing so, we are greatly helping to establish an attitude in favor of negotiation. More and more people in the part of the population where the strength of the peace movement has not yet reached have expressed this attitude.

The United States' Arming of Japan and West Germany is a War Preparation Step. The Just Struggle of the Japanese and German People Must Be Supported.

Joliot-Curie then spoke about some of the issues to be discussed at the special session.

He continued, the treaties signed with Japan and West Germany are two extremely dangerous steps in preparing for war.

The Treaty of Peace with Japan signed in San Francisco without the participation of the Soviet Union and China is indeed of an aggressive nature toward these two countries. The restoration of the Japanese armed forces under the command of the United States, the stationing of American troops in Japan, and the establishment of naval and air bases have turned Japan into an element of aggression.

Official statements from the United States affirm that the situation in Japan is good and that the vast majority of citizens are satisfied.

But let us not be deceived. The very grand demonstrations like the one on May 1 this year, and the equally grand demonstrations held all over Japan a few days ago, are indicative of the problem.

Joliot-Curie cited several facts to illustrate how "new American colonial rule" is being established in Japan and other countries in the East.

Joliot-Curie said that due to these facts, the peace movement has all the more reason to support the people who are fighting for their independence and to demand that the letter and spirit of the charter signed in San Francisco be observed.

He said that in Europe, we are witnessing the development of a situation fraught with grave danger. This development shows that those who have been preparing the current European organization for many years also feel for the first time that it is impossible to openly admit their intentions. The speech of the French Foreign Minister in the French Parliament on November 24, 1949, revealed the danger of "Germany's active military participation in the European defense system," which would immediately cause international tension and the danger of war, and France is unwilling to bear this responsibility or risk this danger.

Covering up the facts with the deceptive cloak of the "European Defense Group" cannot eliminate the danger recently solemnly declared by Schuman. Under the pretext of economic integration and coordination, and under the pretext of establishing purely defensive armed forces, revived German militarism and imperialism are in fact being incorporated into a group established to organize new crusades.

We must expose the deceptiveness of this "European Group" and its threat to peace. The policy that they want the parliaments of the countries that recently signed these treaties to approve destroys the possibility of unifying Germany by peaceful means. Instead of trying to unify Germany by peaceful means, they are striving to create all the conditions so that a militarist government, which does not even conceal its intentions, can unify Germany by force and conquer the territories of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France. They are restoring the same machine that the Third Reich used to launch World War II, which, if the people of all countries do not pay attention, will cause the same disaster.

Many people in Germany and all countries have now fully seen this danger. The demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of French and Italian people from all walks of life, openly expressing their anger at Ridgway's arrival in Europe, vividly prove this.

In all countries, the struggle against reckless war preparations has been launched, and here, I would like to pay special tribute to the heroic and fruitful work done by many Germans in this regard.

The World Peace Council has studied these issues and made recommendations. The Soviet government, which first proposed the demand for negotiations, has put forward concrete proposals for discussion. We agree with the Soviet proposal: Germany must not participate in national groups aimed at opposing any peace-loving country. Now, another proposal has been put forward: despite the conclusion of the Lisbon and Bonn treaties, it is still recommended to convene a Four-Power conference. We must strive to promote such negotiations.

Every peace advocate should understand the importance of the warning issued by the recent international conference held in Odense, Denmark, which was to resolve the German issue on the basis of abandoning militarism and on the basis of peace and international cooperation. The resolution of this conference stated that although someone has taken "a very serious step toward war," the possibility of a peaceful solution to the German issue still exists. The great powers can reach an agreement on the German issue if Germany is given the following rights as determined by the conference: the right to national unification, the right to freely elect a government, the right to conclude a peace treaty, and the right to autonomy and security.

The United States' Continuous Provocative Actions in Korea Have Been Condemned by the Vast Majority of World Public Opinion.

More than two years have passed since the outbreak of the Korean War. The peace movement has consistently believed that it is an extremely important responsibility to fight to end the war so that the unfortunate people can restore all the destroyed things and prevent the war from spreading to other parts of the world. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean War, it is impossible not to be shocked to summarize the results of this war – the appalling details of which will be explained later. Under the guise of so-called liberating the Korean people, the US armed forces were dispatched, and several foreign troops participated. Due to this "liberation," entire cities have been wiped off the face of the earth; tens of thousands of men, women, and children have been burned alive by napalm bombs or killed by bombs; biological discoveries have been used here to spread diseases instead of saving sick people... All this is to restore and maintain the power of a dictator whose actions even his allies cannot help but criticize; they cannot help but accuse him of systematic destruction.

Ceasefire negotiations have been held for a year, but no progress has been made in concluding the armistice agreement hoped for by all families in Korea, China, and the United States. What is the reason for stubbornly thwarting the hopes of the vast majority of mankind who demand peace?

Are those who are preparing for war not using Korea as a testing ground?

They intend to maintain military bases close to China, which the rulers of the United States cannot forgive because it drove away Chiang Kai-shek, who once obeyed them obediently and still obeys them. In addition, the conclusion of an armistice agreement would eliminate the excuse used by President Truman to justify the de facto annexation of Taiwan. Finally, after the end of the war, it would be more difficult to exclude the indisputable representative of 450 million Chinese people from the United Nations. Think about it, for example, just in order to allow the representatives of the slavish Taiwan regime to continue to be permanent members of the mechanical majority, is it conceivable that the United Nations could pass a disarmament convention without China's participation? All these motives have prompted those who have been doing everything possible to obstruct the successful completion of the negotiations for months. The latest obstacle they came up with is the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war.

The events in the Geojedo prisoner-of-war camp are the most instructive. A real conflict occurred there, and many people died.

Finally, can we not condemn in the most severe terms the intentions of those who demand that agents of the subservient Taiwan regime inspect Chinese prisoner-of-war camps?

In order to prevent the conclusion of an armistice agreement at all costs, US aircraft have recently carried out large-scale bombings of the Chinese border. One has to suspect that the purpose of this bombing is to provoke a reaction from the Chinese in order to trigger a third world war?

The vast majority of public opinion has condemned this action. Just look at the excitement of the members of the House of Commons in London, and recall the fierce remarks made by Indian Nehru, and it is not difficult to see how fierce the opposition this action has aroused.

Our attitude remains very clear. We have all kinds of means, we have a fiery heart, we recognize the terrible pain caused by this war and our hearts burn even more fiercely, we must strive first to achieve a ceasefire, and then strive to restore the freedom and independence of the Korean people.

Before I end my brief speech on the Korean tragedy, I must mention the most heinous chapter in human history: the use of biological weapons by the US military. This new means of destruction is perhaps the most degrading of science, so when the news of the use of this new means of destruction came out, the whole world was deeply shocked.

If the accusations about the use of biological weapons have not aroused the due reaction everywhere, they have at least aroused deep shock among many people, especially among scientists. Even in Mr. Austin's own country, the Association of Scientific Workers led by Professor Lusberry solemnly requested the US government to ratify the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925. Before the end of World War II, Professor Lusberry had been in charge of a laboratory specializing in the study of biological weapons. People from all walks of life in many other countries have also made the same request.

I would like to immediately put forward the following points: redouble our efforts to stop germ warfare, prevent such things from happening again, and punish germ warfare criminals. We must not ignore the great danger posed to mankind by the stockpiling of atomic bombs. The horror caused by using biological science discoveries for destructive purposes should not make us regard atomic weapons as conventional armaments. If so, it would be a great mistake. Atomic weapons, like germ weapons, are weapons of mass destruction, and we must demand the prohibition of such weapons more resolutely than ever before.

The World Peace Council Recommends Concluding a Convention Guaranteeing the Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction

Speaking of the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction, I have to turn the topic back to the issue of disarmament that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.

The World Peace Council believes that countries must conclude a preliminary convention, on the one hand, to guarantee the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and to establish supervision over the implementation of this prohibition, and on the other hand, to guarantee the reduction of their armaments. Once these obligations have been signed, compulsory arms inspections must be carried out immediately. It is very clear that the opposite procedure – carrying out investigations before undertaking obligations and before reducing armaments – will bring great danger, because a possible aggressor will of course first want to obtain information about the defensive means of the country he wants to attack through preliminary investigations.

The World Peace Council must acknowledge – like many atomic energy experts – that the supervisory conditions proposed by the Soviet representatives are feasible. It should be pointed out that these conditions mean giving up important autonomous rights, but this abandonment is acceptable because it is in everyone's interest and conducive to world peace.

Referring to the so-called Baruch Plan, Joliot-Curie said: It is necessary to enlighten those who are easily fooled and point out to them how the US rulers disguise their most selfish actions as generosity.

Joliot-Curie spoke about the issue of national sovereignty.

He said: "It is impossible to easily agree to give up sovereignty for the benefit of ruling the country. Doing so will benefit imperialism because it will turn all countries that give up sovereignty into colonies."

Joliot-Curie then said that the United States' policy is to seize the raw materials of other countries, while countries must develop production on the basis of peaceful economic cooperation.

We Welcome All Peace-Loving People in the World to Strive for the Establishment of a Lasting and Just World Peace

Joliot-Curie spoke about the tasks of the peace movement, saying:

It cannot be denied that our actions to stop the war have achieved great success. But in the face of increasingly serious dangers, we must intensify our struggle to make everyone understand the next goal that must be achieved.

Our movement welcomes all peace-loving people, and everyone must know that our only purpose is to avoid the terrible world war that some people are now preparing, and to promote the establishment of a lasting and just peace. Is not the goal of establishing a lasting peace that is beneficial to people with different lifestyles the same destination for the different paths taken by various people who have already begun to struggle and various people who hope to live in peace?

In order to complete our tasks, we must constantly, objectively, and deeply analyze the facts and their interrelationships. We must understand why some people, although they hope to live a peaceful life, have until now had to support or allow the implementation of a policy in many countries that we know will inevitably lead to war.

While we do not claim to be the sole defenders of peace, we can certainly say that the value of our basic principles, our sophistication and maturity, and the breadth of the composition of our movement (which has become a living example of peaceful coexistence) all enable us to victoriously complete these tasks, ease international tensions, and achieve the most effective peaceful solutions.

We have united a considerable part of the public, which is something that the war forces cannot ignore. The achievements we have made have made them furious, so they have greatly slandered our movement. But those who are preparing for war are trying to create a psychological condition that is conducive to promoting their policies. They are trying to push the responsibility for all current difficulties onto those whom they call potential aggressors, and they are depicting the lifestyles of those people as a most terrible picture. Their so-called peace system is nothing more than a war system used to deceive people into accepting their own way of life.

This is the real "spirit of the crusade" that they want to cultivate, the ultimate goal of which is to eliminate those who choose a lifestyle different from theirs.

The people must realize that they have the right to choose this or that lifestyle; the problem is not to support a policy that forces them to accept a lifestyle they do not like. Every country has the right to choose the regime it likes. The principle of peaceful coexistence under different regimes is a basic principle of our struggle for peace, and this principle must be opposed to the crusade policy.

Once this principle is adopted, all international differences can be adjusted through negotiations, which means that countries make concessions to each other and can seek peaceful solutions for the benefit of all.

More and more upright people have seen that the leaders who are implementing the crusade policy are wantonly slandering others, while their own words and deeds are going in different directions, so they have begun to realize the danger that threatens them. They have discovered that the true purpose of this policy is incompatible with their most precious aspirations. Now a considerable number of people are changing their views and supporting finding a real path to peace.

It is understandable that the growing peace potential has not yet been able to exert its power to the maximum.

But there are also some people who do not realize how much evil they are preparing to do to themselves and others by supporting the crusade policy, and unfortunately, very many American citizens have not understood this.

It must be admitted that the American people – who have many advantages and whose great height productivity can be of great help to the whole world – are being increasingly isolated from the rest of the world by the influence of crazy propaganda and the so-called internal security system.

How can the American people reconcile the principles of freedom, humanity, and social progress that they hear with the fact that wherever American so-called aid is received, the ruling government there opposes social progress, freedom, and honesty? How can the fact of supporting a Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, a Syngman Rhee in Korea, and a Bao Dai in Indochina be reconciled with these principles? Does this mean that only the most corrupt and backward things in the world can ensure common defense?

Many Americans who are bravely fighting to educate their compatriots recognize this great contradiction. Those soldiers, staff, businessmen, and travelers who have lived for a period of time in countries that have been interfered with by the United States have returned to the United States and told their compatriots that the people of those countries have no good feelings for them. They said that it can be seen from the slogans demanding that Americans go back found on the walls and roads that what they consider to be American aid has established the most reactionary forces in society in those countries that have received aid, causing poverty, causing the loss of national independence, and causing the persecution of patriots. And this view comes from all social classes in those countries.

We must help the American people jump out of the state of isolation that others want to trap them in.

If we can make them realize the consequences of the policies they support, we can dispel their dangerous illusions and help them realize that they also bear some responsibility for war preparations. We should convince them that their true friends are not where they want to find friends.

The War System is Wavering in Many Ways, and We Must Intensify Our Struggle to Win the Victory of the Peace Movement

Joliot-Curie finally said: Since the beginning of our peace movement, since the first peace congress was held in the "Pleyel" Hall, we have never encountered such a threatening situation. The number of aspects of war danger and the magnitude of the danger have never been greater. But I am convinced that if it were not for the influence of the world peace movement, the situation would probably be even more serious. Have we not already caused major cracks in the war system? This achievement is the reason why those who are preparing for war are furious. We must intensify our struggle more than before. In the process of preparing for the World Peace Congress that we are preparing to convene, the thousands of meetings, discussions, and mass gatherings that will be held will be a powerful way for us to achieve this goal. We have good reason to be optimistic because we see that the war system is wavering in many ways. In the struggle between war and peace, we must awaken the world's awareness in time, then peace will surely win.

### 约里奥—居里在世界和平理事会特别会议开幕会议上的演说

    约里奥—居里在世界和平理事会特别会议开幕会议上的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林三日电：在一日举行的世界和平理事会特别会议的第一次会议上，约里奥—居里发表了演说。
    这次特别会议将要拟出最好办法解决今天使人类陷于分裂的问题
    约里奥—居里说：最近几个月来的严重事件，促使四月一日在奥斯陆开过会的世界和平理事会常务委员会决定召集大家开这一次特别会议，来研究可以用什么和平的方式解决今天使人类陷于分裂的问题，实现这些方式的最好办法是什么。
    最近作出的关于德国和日本的决定、在缔结朝鲜停战协议方面遇到的困难，以及生物武器的使用，都清楚地表明了国际形势已经更加恶化。这就使我们这次会议具有一种我们大家都充分意识到的重大意义。
    在我们这样的一个特别会议上，单单作出决议是不够的，即使这些决议是最好的决议。我们还必须研究、必须找出实现这些决议的最好办法。我们必须吸引人们参加这个工作——吸引那些选派我们出席我们上届大会的千百万男女，吸引一切在上届大会后参加了我们的行列的人，吸引一切要和平的人，即使他目前可能和我们距离还很远。
    约里奥—居里代表世界和平理事会常设委员会建议在今年年底召开世界和平大会，来就和平斗争中最重要的问题充分交换意见。
    在筹备这次大会的过程中，必须让所有那些现在感觉到战争危险的人，所有那些要和平的人都来研究我们的建议，并且设法提出新的建议。在设法正确地估计问题和要采取的行动的重要性的过程中，他们会获得一种信念，这种信念的力量会使得任何人都能够传播争取和平的积极意志。
    这样，到现在还没有参加我们的运动的千百万男女就会行动起来保卫和平，没有他们的支持，和平就不能拯救。
    只有说服了各国绝大多数的公民，使他们一起来坚持用公正和平的方式解决使世界陷于分裂的问题，我们才能够实现这些决定。
    和平运动所唤醒的舆论的力量已经有所表现：由于斯德哥尔摩宣言，才阻止了在亚洲使用原子弹。
    我应该提醒大家：当联合国上次在巴黎开大会的时候，在维也纳开会的我们曾经强调过裁军的问题，这个问题在华沙大会所通过的告联合国书里已经提到过。舆论用最多种多样的方式表示了自己的意见，以致联合国大会主席佩狄拉·纳孚感觉不能不告诉世界和平理事会的代表团说，舆论有力地表示自己的意见是很重要的，这才能指导联合国的活动有效地为和平工作。
    在那次联合国大会上，我们并得以把我们维也纳会议的决议交给联合国所有各国的代表。许多代表团得到主要国家的代表的接见，我们敢毫不歪曲事实地说，这种压力对于组织联合国裁减军备委员会起了很大的作用。这个委员会的任务是满足两个基本的要求：消灭具有大规模毁灭性的武器的威胁，取得普遍而有控制地裁减军备的决定。六月十五日，裁减军备委员会向安全理事会提出了它的第一次报告，这个报告非常令人失望。所以如此，是因为舆论还不够警惕和积极，这说明了我们必须做的是什么工作。
    在过去几个月来，我们全体都可以看到有人企图散布这样的意见：现在唯一可能的解决办法是依靠武力，唯一出路是组织一支庞大得足够用战争方式强使别人服从或接受自己的意志的军队。不能让步，不能姑息。
    但是也有另外一种意见出现，这种意见缓慢地然而稳步地在千百万人的思想里占了地位，那就是，和主张用武力解决问题的意见相反的，主张用谈判来解决问题的意见。
    人们关于缔结我们在这个城市（柏林——编者注）所建议的那种五大国和平公约的热切要求，以及在为五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集签名的运动中所引起的广泛讨论（这种讨论使得每一个人都能够了解宣言的意义及其全部重要性），证明武力冲突绝不是不可避免的，一切问题、一切矛盾都可以用谈判来解决。
    我们深信，我们这样做，是大有助于确立一种赞成谈判的态度的。在和平运动的力量目前还不及的那部分人民中间，有愈来愈多的人表示了这种态度。
    美国武装日本和西德是备战步骤必须支持日本德国人民正义斗争
    约里奥—居里接着谈到特别会议所要讨论的一些问题。
    他继续说，与日本和西德签订的条约是准备战争的两个极端危险的步骤。
    在苏联和中国都没有参加的情况下在旧金山签订的对日和约，事实上的确是具有侵略这两个国家的性质的。在美国命令下恢复日本的武装部队，美国军队的驻在日本，海空军基地的建立，这种种已经把日本变成一个侵略的因素。
    美国的官方声明肯定说，日本的情况良好，极大多数公民都很满足。
    但是我们不要上当。像今年五月一日那样的非常盛大的示威，像几天以前在全日本各地举行同样盛大的示威，都是能说明问题的。
    约里奥—居里援引若干事实，说明“新的美国殖民统治”怎样在日本及东方其他国家建立起来。
    约里奥—居里说，由于这些事实，和平运动就格外有理由支持为自己的独立而斗争的人民，并要求遵守在旧金山所签署的宪章的文字和精神。
    他说，在欧洲，我们正在亲眼看到一种充满着严重危险的局势发展。这种发展表明，那些多年来一直在筹备现在的欧洲组织的人，也第一次感觉到不可能公开承认他们的意图了。法国外交部长一九四九年十一月二十四日在法国议会的发言透露了“德国在军事上积极参加欧洲防御体系”的危险，这种参加会立刻引起国际紧张和战争危险，法国既不愿意担负这种责任，也不愿意冒这种危险。
    用“欧洲防御集团”的欺人外衣来掩盖事实，并不能消除舒曼最近郑重宣告的那种危险。在经济联合和统筹的藉口下，在成立纯防御性的武装部队的藉口下，复活了的德国军国主义和帝国主义事实上正被并入一个为了组织新的十字军而成立的集团。
    我们必须揭穿这个“欧洲集团”的欺骗性以及它对和平的威胁。他们想要最近签订了这些条约的各国的议会批准的政策，破坏用和平方法统一德国的可能。他们不设法用和平方法统一德国，和这相反，他们正竭力制造一切条件，以便使一个甚至不掩饰其意图的军国主义政府，得以用武力统一德国，并征服波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和法国的领土。他们正在恢复第三帝国用来发动第二次世界大战的同一个机器，如果各国人民不加以注意，这就会引起同样的灾难。
    德国和一切国家的人民有许多现在已经完全看清了这种危险。数十万各行各业的法国人和意大利人举行示威，公开表示他们对李奇微来到欧洲感到愤怒，这就生动地证明了这一点。
    在所有的国家里，已经展开了反对不顾一切地准备战争的斗争，在这里，我要特别对很多德国人在这方面所完成的英勇而有成就的工作表示敬意。
    世界和平理事会已研究了这些问题，并提出了建议。首先提出谈判要求的苏联政府已提出具体建议以供讨论。我们同意苏联的建议：德国不得参加旨在反对任何爱好和平国家的国家集团。现在，又提出了一个建议：尽管已缔结了里斯本和波恩条约，仍建议召开四强会议。我们必须努力促成这种谈判。
    每一个和平拥护者都应该了解最近在丹麦鄂丹斯举行的国际会议所发出的警告的重要性，这次会议是为了要在抛弃军国主义的基础上，在和平和国际合作的基础上来解决德国问题。这次会议的决议说，虽然有人已经采取了“一个走向战争的非常严重的步骤”，但是和平解决德国问题的可能性仍然存在。大国能够在德国问题上达成协议，假如赋予德国如会议所确定的如下权利的话：国家统一的权利，自由选举政府的权利，缔结和约的权利，自主和安全的权利。
    美国在朝鲜进行接连的挑衅行动已受到世界绝大部分舆论的谴责
    朝鲜战争爆发已经两年有余。和平运动一贯认为，进行斗争来结束战争，俾使不幸的人民能够恢复所有破坏的东西，使战争不致蔓延到世界的其它地方去，这是一个极重要的责任。值此朝鲜战争两周年的时候，总结一下这个战争的结果——这个战争的骇人听闻的详情将在后面说明——是不可能不令人震惊的。假借所谓解放朝鲜人民的名义，美国武装部队出动了，并有若干外国军队参加。由于这种“解放”，整个整个的城市从地球表面上消灭了；成千成万的男女和儿童被凝固汽油弹活活烧死，或者被炸弹炸死；生物学的发现在这里被利用来散播疫病，而不是拯救患病的人民……所有这些，是为了恢复并保持一个独裁者的权力，这个独裁者的行径，连他的盟友也不免要加以批评；他们也不免要指责他有系统地制造的破坏。
    举行停战谈判已经一年了，但是在缔结为朝鲜、中国和美国的一切家庭所希望的停战协定方面，并没有获得什么成就。硬要顽梗不化地使人类绝大多数要求和平的希望落空，究竟是什么道理呢？
    难道那些准备战争的人不是把朝鲜当作试验场吗？
    他们打算保持靠近中国的军事基地，而中国是美国统治者所不能宽恕的，因为它赶走了曾经千依百顺地服从他们，而且现在仍然服从他们的蒋介石。此外，缔结停战协定就会消灭杜鲁门总统借以辩护实际上并吞台湾的藉口。最后，战争结束后，就更难把四亿五千万中国人民的不容置辩的代表排斥于联合国之外了。大家想想看，比如，仅仅是为了要使得台湾代表可以继续成为机械多数的永久成员，联合国没有中国参加就通过一项裁减军备公约，这难道是可以想像的吗？所有这些动机促使那些人数月来千方百计地阻挠谈判的胜利完成。他们最近想出来的一个障碍就是关于遣返战俘的问题。
    巨济岛战俘营的事件是最富教训意义的。那里发生了真正的冲突，死了许多人。
    最后，对那些要求让奴颜婢膝的台湾政权的特务视察中国战俘营的人们的意图，我们能不予以最严厉的斥责吗？
    为了不惜任何代价阻止缔结停战协定，美国飞机最近大举轰炸中国边界。人们要怀疑，这种轰炸的目的，是不是想激起中国人的反应，以触起第三次世界大战？
    绝大部分舆论都谴责了这种行动。只要看一下伦敦下议院议员激动的情形，回忆一下印度尼赫鲁发表的激烈谈话，便不难看出这种行动引起了多么激烈的反对。
    我们的态度仍然十分明确。我们有着种种办法，我们具有一颗火热的心，我们认识到这个战争所造成的可怕的痛苦而心里更加炽热地燃烧起来，我们必须努力首先争取停火，而后争取恢复朝鲜人民的自由和独立。
    我在没有结束我关于朝鲜悲剧的这段简短发言之前，必须提到人类历史上最凶恶的一章：美国军队的使用生物武器。这种新的毁灭手段也许是最使科学堕落的了，因此当这种新毁灭手段使用的消息传出来以后，全世界都为之深深震动。
    如果关于使用生物武器的指责还没有在各地都引起应有的反应，那至少已在许多人士当中引起深刻的惊动，特别是在科学界人士当中。甚至在奥斯汀先生的本国，鲁斯贝利教授领导下的科学工作者协会也郑重地要求美国政府批准一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。鲁斯贝利教授在第二次世界大战结束以前一直主持一个专门研究生物武器的实验室的工作。其他许多国家各个最不同的社会阶层的人民也都提出了同样的要求。
    我愿马上提出下列各点：加倍努力制止细菌战，防止今后再发生这种事并惩办细菌战犯，我们一定不要忽视囤积原子弹对人类造成的巨大危险。因把生物科学上的发现用于毁灭性目的而引起的恐怖，不应使我们因此就把原子武器看作常规军备，如果这样，那就是极大的错误。原子武器也和细菌武器一样，是具有大规模毁灭性的武器，我们必须比前此任何时候都更坚决地要求禁止这种武器。
    世界和平理事会建议缔结公约保证禁止大规模毁灭性的武器
    谈到禁止大规模毁灭性的武器的问题，我不得不把话题又转到我这篇演讲开始时已经谈到的裁减军备问题上。
    世界和平理事会认为各国必须缔结一个初步的公约，一方面保证禁止大规模毁灭性的武器，对这个禁令的执行建立监督，另一方面保证裁减它们的军备。一俟这些义务签署了以后，必须立刻进行强迫性的军备检查。大家很清楚，相反的一种程序——在承担义务之前，在裁减军备之前先进行调查将带来莫大的危险，因为一个可能的侵略者当然首先要想通过初步的调查获得关于他要进攻的国家的防御手段的情报。
    世界和平理事会必须承认——像许多原子能专家一样——苏联代表提出的监督条件是可行的。应该指出，这些条件意味着放弃重要的自主权利，但是这种放弃是可以接受的，因为这符合大家的利益，有利于世界和平。
    约里奥—居里在提到所谓巴鲁区计划时说：必须启发那些轻易被人愚弄的人们，向他们指出美国统治者怎样把他们的最自私的行动伪装为慷慨大度。
    约里奥—居里谈到了国家主权问题。
    他说：“为了统治国家的利益，轻易同意放弃主权是不可能的。这样做将有利于帝国主义，因为这就会把所有放弃主权的国家变成殖民地。”
    约里奥—居里然后说，美国的政策是要攫夺其他国家的原料，而各国则必须在和平经济合作的基础上发展生产。
    我们欢迎世界一切爱好和平者争取建立世界持久公正的和平
    约里奥—居里谈到和平运动的任务说：
    不能否认，我们制止战争的行动已经获得巨大的成就。但是面临着愈来愈严重的危险，我们必须加紧斗争，务使人人明白下一个必须达到的目标。
    我们的运动欢迎一切爱好和平的人们，每个人都必须知道，我们的唯一目的是避免目前某些人正在准备的可怕的世界大战，促成建立持久的、公正的和平。建立对生活方式各不相同的人们都有好处的持久和平这个目标，难道不是已经开始斗争的各种人们，希望和平生活的各种人们所走的不同的道路的同一归趋吗？
    为了完成我们的任务，我们必须经常客观而深入地分析事实和它们的相互关系。我们必须了解，为什么有一部分人虽然希望过和平的生活，但到现在为止却在许多国家里一直不得不支持或容许实行一种我们知道必定会引起战争的政策。
    我们固然不以我们是和平的唯一保卫者自居，但是我们可以肯定地说，我们基本原则的价值、我们的老练成熟，以及我们的运动（它已成为和平共存的活生生的榜样）的组成成份之广泛，在在都使我们能够胜利地完成这些任务，缓和国际的紧张局势并使我们达到最有效的和平解决的目的。
    我们已经团结了相当大的一部分公众，这是战争势力不能不加以考虑的。我们所获得的成就使他们暴跳如雷，于是对我们的运动大事诽谤。但是那些准备战争的人们竭力想制造一种有利于推行他们的政策的心理条件。他们竭力把当前的一切困难的责任都推到那些被他们称为潜在的侵略者的人们身上，并且把那些人们的生活方式描绘成为一幅最可怖的图画。他们的所谓和平制度不是别的，只是一种用来骗人接受他们自己那种生活方式的战争制度。
    这就是他们所要培养起来的真正的“十字军的精神”，这种精神的最终目的是消灭那些选择和他们不同的生活方式的人们。
    人民必须认识到他们是有权利选择这种或那种生活方式的；问题是不要支持那种强迫他们接受他们所不喜欢的生活方式的政策。每个国家都有选择它所喜欢的政权的权利。在不同政权之下和平共存的原则是我们争取和平斗争的一个基本原则，这个原则一定要和十字军政策相对立的。
    这种原则一经采行，国际上的所有歧见都能通过谈判求得调整，这意味着各国彼此让步，并能为全体的利益求得和平的解决。
    越来越多的正直的人民看到了实行十字军政策的首脑们肆意诽谤别人，而自己的言行又是各走一端，因此已经开始意识到威胁他们的危险了。他们发现了这种政策的真正目的和他们最可贵的憧憬是势不两立的。现在已有相当多的人民在转变他们的看法，赞成找出一条真正通向和平的道路。
    可以理解，正在成长中的和平潜力还没有能够把它的力量发挥到最大限度。
    但是也还有一些人，他们没有了解到：他们支持十字军政策就是在准备对自己和别人作多少恶，而且不幸得很，首先就有非常多的美国公民没有了解这一点。
    人们必须承认：美国人民——他们有许多优点，他们的巨大的高度生产力对全世界是可以有很大的帮助的——正在受着疯狂宣传和所谓内部安全制度的影响，使他们越来越和世界其他地方相隔绝。
    美国人民所听到的是自由、人道和社会进步的原则，而事实却是凡是受美国的所谓援助的地方，那里的当权政府就反对社会进步、自由和诚实，这种情形他们怎能调和起来呢？在台湾扶植一个蒋介石，在朝鲜扶植一个李承晚，在印度支那扶植一个保大，这种事实怎能和这些原则相调和呢？这是不是说，只有世界上最腐败、最落后的东西才能确保共同防御呢？
    许多为教育本国同胞而勇敢战斗的美国人，都认识到这种极大的矛盾。那些曾在受到美国干涉的国家里住过一个时期的军人、职员、商人和游历者回到美国以后，都告诉他们的同胞说，那些国家的人民对于他们毫无好感。他们说，从墙壁和公路上发现的要求美国人滚回去的标语上可以看出，他们所认为的美国援助，却在那些受到援助的国家里建立了社会上最反动的势力，引起了贫困，引起了国家独立的丧失和对于爱国人士的迫害。而这种看法是从那些国家里的各社会阶层来的。
    我们一定要帮助美国人民跳出别人想使他们陷在里面的隔绝状态。
    假若我们能使他们认识到他们所支持的政策实行的后果究竟如何，我们就可以打消他们危险的幻想，并且可以帮助他们认识到：对于战争准备，他们也负有一部分责任。我们应该使他们确信：他们真正的朋友，并不在他们想从那里找到朋友的地方。
    战争体系在许多方面正摇摇欲坠必须加紧斗争争取和平运动胜利
    约里奥—居里最后说：自从我们的和平运动开始以来，自从在“普列叶”大厅举行第一届和平大会以来，我们从未遇到这样威胁逼人的形势。战争危险的方面之多和危险之大，也是从来没有过的。但是我深信：假若没有世界和平运动的影响，形势恐怕还要更为严重。我们不是已使战争的体系内发生了大裂隙吗？这种成就便是那些准备战争的人之所以愤怒的原因所在。我们必须比以前更加加紧进行斗争。在筹备我们正准备召开的世界和平大会的过程中，那行将举行的成千上万的会议、讨论和群众集会，将是我们达到这种目的的有力方式。我们很有理由表示乐观，因为我们看到：在许多方面战争体系都在摇摇欲坠。在战争与和平的斗争中，我们必须及时地唤起全世界的觉悟，那么和平就一定会胜利。
