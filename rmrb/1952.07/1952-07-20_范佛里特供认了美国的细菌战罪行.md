    Van Fleet Admits US Germ Warfare Crimes
    Van Fleet, commander of the US Eighth Army who directly commanded the US invading forces to conduct germ warfare on the Korean battlefield, has now confessed that the US invading army did indeed use bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. In a private conversation with Belgian Minister to Tokyo, Mr. Schellekens, when Schellekens asked about the issue of American planes dropping bacteria in North Korea and Chinese territory, he blatantly replied, "It is not surprising that the American army uses means of mass killing that have not been used before in order to achieve victory." The American invaders can no longer deny this private and secret confession of this murderer.
    Since the invading American army began using bacteriological weapons on a large scale in Korea and China in January this year, the Chinese and Korean people, righteous people all over the world, and just public opinion have continuously made righteous and stern accusations and exposures against the inhumane crimes of the American invaders with countless conclusive evidences; however, the American invaders have always adopted a shameless attitude of denial, doing everything possible to deny that they have committed such heinous crimes that are deeply hated by the people of the world, attempting to deceive the world. Van Fleet's secret confession now once again proves that all the denials made by the American invaders regarding their germ warfare crimes are extremely shameless lies that are not worth refuting.
    Why is it that the American invaders are unwilling to admit their germ warfare crimes in all public occasions, in the face of the confessions of American prisoners of war Iraq and Quinn and other countless ironclad evidence, but only dare to admit this crime in Van Fleet's private conversation? This is because they clearly know that using this "means of mass killing" is an unforgivable crime, and only in the context of a private conversation will murderers be carried away by momentary elation and tell the truth. After slaughtering countless human beings and staining their hands with blood, emitting a burst of sinister laughter, saying that this "is not surprising", this is the habitual face of heinous murdering robbers.
    Van Fleet is the American military officer who personally commanded the germ warfare, and his face is exactly the same as the faces of the bosses of the murder companies on Wall Street in New York and the Pentagon in Washington. From this, the people of the world can see more clearly the extremely ferocious face of the American invaders, who are the common enemies of peace-loving people all over the world. All peace-loving people in the world should take active action to stop the barbaric crimes of the American germ warfare criminals in their large-scale massacre of humanity.

### 范佛里特供认了美国的细菌战罪行

    范佛里特供认了美国的细菌战罪行
    在朝鲜战场上直接指挥美国侵略军进行细菌战的美国第八军军长范佛里特，现在已经招认侵朝美军确确实实在朝鲜和中国使用了细菌武器。他在与比利时驻东京使团团长薛佛勒里的私人谈话中，对薛佛勒里所提出的美国飞机在北朝鲜和中国领土投掷细菌的问题，赤裸裸地回答说：“美国军队为了获得胜利而使用以前没有使用过的大规模杀人手段，并不是什么令人惊奇的事。”美国侵略者对于这个杀人犯的私人的秘密口供，再也不能抵赖了。
    自今年一月侵朝美军在朝鲜和我国大规模使用细菌武器以来，中朝人民、全世界正义的人士和公正的舆论对于美国侵略者这种灭绝人性的罪行，曾不断地以无数真凭实据，进行了义正词严的控诉和揭露；可是，美国侵略者对此一直采取无耻抵赖的态度，百般否认他们曾犯有这种为全世界人民所深恶痛绝的滔天罪行，企图欺骗世人。现在范佛里特的秘密供词，再一次证明了美国侵略者对于它的细菌战罪行所进行的一切抵赖，都是不值一驳的极端无耻的谰言。
    为什么美国侵略者在一切公开的场合，在美国战俘伊拉克和奎恩的供词及其他无数铁证面前，都不肯招认它的细菌战罪行，而仅仅在范佛里特的私人谈话中才敢招认这种罪行呢？这就因为他们明知使用这种“大规模的杀人手段”是罪无可赦的，而只有在私人谈话的场合，杀人犯们才会一时得意忘形地说出了真话。在屠杀了无数人类，手上沾满了鲜血之后，发出一阵狞笑，说这“并不是什么令人惊奇的事”，这就是罪大恶极的杀人强盗的惯常的嘴脸。
    范佛里特是亲身指挥细菌战的美国军官，他的这一副嘴脸是和美国纽约华尔街及华盛顿五角大楼的杀人公司老板们的嘴脸一模一样的。全世界人民从这里可以更清楚地看见美国侵略者的极端凶残的面目，他们是全世界和平人民共同的仇敌。全世界爱好和平的人民，应该积极行动起来，制止美国细菌战犯大规模屠杀人类的野蛮罪行。
