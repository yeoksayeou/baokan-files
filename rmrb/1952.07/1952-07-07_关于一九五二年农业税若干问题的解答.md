Answers to Several Questions Regarding the 1952 Agricultural Tax
Editor's Note: Since the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Instructions on the 1952 Agricultural Tax Collection Work," many readers have written to this newspaper raising several questions. We have compiled these questions and asked the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for answers.

Q: The old liberated areas are preparing to implement a progressive tax system next year. Will this affect the enthusiasm of farmers for production?

A: The implementation of a progressive tax system in the old liberated areas will absolutely not affect the enthusiasm of farmers for production. Because:

First, after the progressive tax is implemented, agricultural tax will still be levied based on the normal annual yield of taxable land, not based on the actual yield. If farmers produce more grain through intensive farming, more fertilizer application, and soil improvement, exceeding the normal annual yield, the tax will still be levied based on the normal annual yield, without increasing the burden. For example, last year the actual yield of many high-yield households greatly exceeded the normal annual yield; but when collecting taxes, the normal annual yield was still calculated according to the operating level of ordinary farmers in the area. In this way, compared with the actual yield, the burden on high-yield households is greatly reduced. Therefore, whether it is a proportional tax system or a progressive tax system, it will not affect agricultural production.

Second, a progressive tax system is a more reasonable tax system, and therefore more conducive to agricultural production. The so-called "progressive" means that the more the income (calculated based on the normal annual yield of the land, the same below), the higher the tax rate. Because people with more income have a stronger ability to bear the burden. If people with more income bear the same tax rate as people with less income, the burden will be too heavy for those with less income. Implementing a progressive tax allows people with less income to receive due consideration, making it easier to increase production. Although the tax rate is higher for people with more income, the remaining amount after paying taxes is still large, and they still have the ability to expand reproduction. Moreover, progression also has a limit (currently the highest tax rate in the late liberated areas is 30 percent). This method is in line with the principle of reasonable burden stipulated in the Common Program. During the land reform in the old liberated areas, land was generally divided equally among all classes. At that time, it was correct to implement a proportional tax system. At present, the rural economy of the old liberated areas, in the general trend of gradual rise, has undergone many changes. In order to adapt to the affordability of farmers of all classes, it is completely necessary and appropriate to prepare to implement a progressive tax system next year. Moreover, the progressive tax system to be implemented in the old liberated areas will not restore the old method of the "unified progressive tax" during the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, land reform had not yet been implemented in rural areas, so the tax rate progressed higher and faster. Now that the landlord class no longer exists, the tax rate progression is relatively slow. Therefore, after the implementation of the progressive tax system, the burden on farmers in the old liberated areas will be more fair and reasonable.

Q: Why does the proportional tax system in the Northeast region stipulate three tax rates?

A: The economic conditions in various parts of the Northeast region are unbalanced. According to existing materials, the average agricultural income per person in various parts of the Northeast is about 1,687 catties in North Manchuria (local main grain, the same below), about 845 catties in South Manchuria, and about 504 catties in Rehe, which is a big difference. Under these circumstances, it would be unreasonable to stipulate only one tax rate. Therefore, North Manchuria is stipulated to have a tax rate of 23 percent, South Manchuria 21 percent, and Rehe 15 percent, to take care of the different economic conditions in various places. After the progressive tax system is implemented next year, this problem can be completely solved.

Q: According to the tax rate table for areas in the late liberated areas that have completed land reform, promulgated by the State Council, is it reasonable that the tax rate for middle peasants in some affluent areas, whose average agricultural income per person is more than 1,000 catties, reaches more than 20 percent?

A: China has a vast territory, and the economic conditions in various places are extremely unbalanced. For example, in the poor mountainous areas of western Hubei, western Hunan, and northern Guangdong, the average agricultural income per person is only 300 to 400 catties, or 400 to 500 catties; while in the affluent areas around Taihu Lake, on the banks of Dongting Lake, and on the Chengdu Plain, the average agricultural income per person reaches 1,000 catties or more. Therefore, only by implementing a progressive tax system can we adapt to the different affordability of all classes. Therefore, the tax rate table promulgated by the State Council is completely reasonable. According to this tax rate table, the tax rate for an average agricultural income of 300 catties per person is 10 percent; 600 catties, 16 percent; 1,000 catties, 20 percent; and 2,000 catties, 30 percent. The tax rate varies depending on the amount of income. Judging from the remaining income after paying taxes, the remaining amount for an income of 300 catties is 270 catties, the remaining amount for an income of 600 catties is 504 catties, the remaining amount for an income of 1,000 catties is 800 catties, and the remaining amount for an income of 2,000 catties is 1,400 catties. It can be seen from this that the remaining amount after paying taxes for those with an income of more than 1,000 catties is several times more than those with less income. Therefore, it is completely reasonable.

Q: According to the agricultural tax collection policy stipulated by the State Council, how should we understand the terms "task" and "arrears" in agricultural tax collection?

A: During the Liberation War and shortly after the national liberation, we did not have a very good understanding of the figures for population, land, and output. At that time, in order to ensure the supply for the revolutionary war, we habitually referred to the tax collection budget as a "task." This cannot be said to be wrong at the time, but we cannot preserve it forever. It should be pointed out that this method inevitably has an estimated nature, resulting in phenomena of excessively light or heavy burdens. After we have determined the policy of "thoroughly conducting land surveys to determine output, calculating taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law," the only correct interpretation of the so-called "completing the task" can only be "completing the task of conducting land surveys to determine output, calculating taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law." From now on, the inspection of agricultural tax work, as the People's Daily editorial on June 19th said: "It should be based on whether the policy of conducting land surveys to determine output, calculating taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law has been seriously implemented. Apart from this, there can be no other standards." As for the reference figures for the amount of tax collection from the central government to the major administrative regions or from the major administrative regions to the provinces, they are only estimates made to facilitate the preparation of the budget, and should be called "indicators" and not "tasks."

According to the above principles, the so-called "arrears" should be the difference between the "tax payable" (tax calculated according to the rate minus the amount of tax reduced or exempted according to law) and the tax actually collected. In the past, some areas called the difference between the amount collected and the "task" amount arrears, which was inappropriate.

### 关于一九五二年农业税若干问题的解答

    关于一九五二年农业税若干问题的解答
    编者按：自中央人民政府政务院公布了“关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示”以后，许多读者给本报写信，提出了若干问题。我们把这些问题综合起来，请中央人民政府财政部作了解答。
    问：老解放区准备明年改行累进税制，这样会不会影响农民生产的积极性？
    答：老解放区改行累进税制，绝不会影响农民生产的积极性。因为：
    第一，改行累进税后，仍是按纳税土地常年应产量计征农业税，而不是按实产量计征。农民由于精耕细作、多施肥料、改良土质而多打了粮食，超过常年应产量的，仍按常年应产量计征，并不增加负担。例如去年许多丰产户的实产量，都大大超过了常年应产量；但征税时，仍是按照当地一般农民的经营水平计算常年应产量。这样，和实产量比较，丰产户的负担是大大减轻了。所以不管比例税制或累进税制，都不会影响农业生产。
    第二，累进税制是一种更合理的税收制度，因而也是更有利于农业生产的。所谓“累进”，就是收入（按土地常年应产量计算，下同）愈多，税率愈高。因为收入愈多的人，负担能力愈强，如果收入多的人和收入少的人负担同样的税率，收入少的人就嫌重了。实行累进税，收入少的人可以得到应有的照顾，便于提高生产。收入多的人税率虽高，而纳税后的所余仍多，还有扩大再生产的能力。而且累进也有一个限度（现在晚解放的地区最高税率为百分之三十），这种办法是符合于共同纲领所规定的合理负担原则的。老解放区在土地改革时，各阶层的土地大体平分了，在当时实行比例税制，是正确的。目前，老解放区的农村经济，在逐渐上升的总趋势中，已经发生了不少变化，为了适应各阶层农民的负担能力，准备在明年改行累进税制，是完全必要的和适宜的。并且，老解放区将要实行的累进税制，并不是恢复抗日战争时期“统一累进税”的老办法。那时农村中还没有实行土地改革，所以税率累进较高较快。现在既然地主阶级不存在了，所以税率累进是比较缓慢的。因此，累进税制实行以后，会使老解放区农民的负担更加公平合理。
    问：东北区的比例税制，为什么规定三个税率？
    答：东北区各地的经济情况，是不平衡的。据现有材料，东北各地每人平均农业收入，北满约一千六百八十七斤左右（当地所产主粮，下同），南满约八百四十五斤左右，热河约五百零四斤左右，差别很大。在这种情况之下，如果只规定一个税率，是不合理的。所以分别规定北满的税率为百分之二十三、南满为百分之二十一、热河为百分之十五，以照顾各地不同的经济情况。明年改行累进税制后，这一问题就可以得到彻底的解决。
    问：依照政务院公布的晚解放区已经完成土地改革地区的税率表，某些富裕地区的中农，其农业收入每人平均在一千斤以上的，税率达到百分之二十以上，是否合理？
    答：中国幅员广大，各地经济情况极不平衡。例如鄂西、湘西、粤北等贫瘠山区，每人平均农业收入只有三四百斤，或四五百斤；而太湖周围、洞庭湖滨、成都平原等富庶地区，每人平均农业收入则达一千斤或一千斤以上。因此，只有实行累进税制，才适应各阶层的不同负担能力。因此，政务院所公布的税率表，是完全合理的。按照这一税率表，每人平均农业收入三百斤的，税率为百分之十；六百斤的，百分之十六；一千斤的，百分之二十；二千斤的，百分之三十。税率的高低随收入的多少而有不同。从纳税后的剩余收入来看，收入三百斤的剩余二百七十斤，收入六百斤的剩余五百零四斤，收入一千斤的剩余八百斤，收入二千斤的剩余一千四百斤。由此可以看出，收入在一千斤以上的，纳税后的剩余，还超过收入少的好几倍。因此，它是完全合理的。
    问：根据政务院规定的农业税收方针，对于农业税征收中的“任务”、“尾欠”等名词，应当怎样了解？
    答：在解放战争中及在全国解放不久的情况下，我们对人口、土地、产量等数字还不很了解，当时为了保证革命战争的供给，曾在习惯上把征收概算称为“任务”。这在当时不能说是错误的，但也不能把它永远保存下来。应当指出，这种办法，难免带有估计性，产生负担上畸轻畸重的现象。在我们确定了“贯彻查田定产，依率计征，依法减免”的方针之后，所谓“完成任务”，其唯一正确的解释，只能是“完成查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的任务”。今后检查农业税收工作，也正如六月十九日的人民日报社论所说：“应该以是否认真执行了查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的方针为标准。除此以外，不能再有其他标准。”至于中央对各大行政区或大行政区对各省征收额的参考数字，只是为了便于编造概算而作的估计，应当称作“指标数”而不能叫作“任务”。
    根据上述原则，所谓“尾欠”，应当是“应征税额”（依率计征税额减去依法减免额）与实征税额之间的差额。过去有的地区把征起数与“任务”数的差额，叫作尾欠，是不妥当的。
