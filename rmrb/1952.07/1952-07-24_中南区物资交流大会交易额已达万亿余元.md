    The Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference, which began trading on the 14th, had completed 2,585 transactions by the 19th, with a total value exceeding 1 trillion yuan. This figure surpasses the total transaction volume of the Central South Region Native and Special Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference last summer over 75 days by more than 23 percent.

    In the transactions, the state-owned economic sector implemented the principles of "large-scale buying and large-scale selling," "having purchases and sales," "mutual assistance and mutual benefit," and "mutual support," gradually enhancing the operating enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial enterprises. Judging from the 850 billion yuan in transaction volume, private industrial and commercial enterprises accounted for 37.8 percent of the total purchases at the conference in terms of procurement.

    The sluggish sales of native and special products such as live pigs, eggs, coarse grains, local paper, local sugar, local cloth, and cottonseed oil in the Central South Region have all found outlets. After selling these items, delegations from various regions are actively purchasing production and living materials for the farmers. Sprayers, manual seeders, and 7-inch light plows produced by the Hubei Province Agricultural Implement Factory are in short supply. The Wuhan State-owned Department Store and the knitting industry have sold 250,000 dozens of long-stockpiled socks to the rural areas of Hubei. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南区物资交流大会交易额已达万亿余元
    中南区物资交流大会从十四日开始交易，到十九日止，已成交二千五百八十五笔，金额已达一万亿元以上。这一数字超过去年夏天中南区土产、特产展览交流大会七十五天成交总额的百分之二十三强。
    在交易中，国营经济部门贯彻执行了“大买大卖”、“有购有销”、“互助互利”、“互相支持”的方针，逐步提高了私营工商业者的经营积极性。仅从八千五百亿元的交易额中统计，私营工商业在进货方面，就占大会购进总额的百分之三十七点八。
    中南区滞销的生猪、鸡蛋、杂粮、土纸、土糖、土布、棉油等土产、特产都已打开了销路。各地代表团售出这些东西后，正纷纷收购农民的生产、生活资料。湖北省农具制造厂生产的喷雾器、人力压花机、七吋轻便犁等已供不应求。武汉市国营百货公司及针织业长期积压的袜子，已有二十五万打销向湖北农村。    （新华社）
