Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: According to TASS, the Soviet Aviation Day celebration was held at the Tushino airfield in Moscow on the 27th. Marshal Stalin personally attended.

    Early in the morning, trains, cars, buses, and trams bound for Tushino were packed with passengers heading to the airfield. The streets of Moscow were decorated with air force flags. Tens of thousands of people waited to watch the performances of Soviet aviators, glider pilots, and parachutists at the green airfield, decorated with a festive atmosphere.

    Amidst joyous songs, the great Stalin appeared on the reviewing stand. At that moment, thunderous cheers shook the entire airfield.

    At exactly 2:00 PM, a resounding bugle announced the start of the air force parade. The solemn Soviet national anthem and gun salutes rang out simultaneously. Millions of eyes were fixed on the distant sky, as many aircraft flew in formation. The planes carried a red flag with Stalin's portrait, the air force flag, the national flags of the Soviet republics, and large banners with the slogan "Forward to Communism." Just after these planes flew by, nearly one hundred sports planes flew over the airfield. These planes were all piloted by amateur pilots—workers, engineers, and students—who flew over the airfield in the shape of the words "Glory to Stalin."

    The celebration's performance program was divided into three parts. The first part was the performance of Soviet gliding pilots, with athletes from Moscow and other Soviet cities participating. Students from the Soviet Voluntary Society for Cooperation with the Army, Air Force, and Navy (DOSAAF) demonstrated their skills in formation flying with airplanes and gliders. They neatly performed the most complex maneuvers—somersaults, rolls, and spirals. The audience unanimously praised the skillful techniques of a team of female aviators led by Soviet Hero Chicheneva. Thirty-two amateur pilots, led by world record holder Glovanov, performed a series of brilliant maneuvers in light sports planes. After these planes flew away, a team of gliders appeared in the sky, led by the famous female athlete Rasenskaya. These gliders, designed by Antonov, flew silently in the air, displaying their skillful techniques and precision.

    The second part was a Soviet Air Force performance. Soviet pilots were the first in the world to master aerobatics with jet planes. The audience at the airfield, seeing the pilots' skill, bravery, and fearlessness, were all proud of these brave sons of the Soviet motherland. Jet planes designed by Mikoyan then appeared. Their speed was so fast that even the eyes could barely keep up with them. The head-on flight of the jet planes was truly a thrilling scene. Two teams of planes flew towards each other at dazzling speeds, came close, and then separated. Plane after plane rolled, somersaulted, and soared into the high sky. Next was the formation flight performance of fighter planes. Fighter planes designed by Mikoyan, in teams of five and nine, performed. The audience enthusiastically cheered for the "Stalin's Eagles." Following this, teams of aircraft designed by outstanding Soviet designers such as Tupolev, Ilyushin, and Mikoyan flew over the airfield. Helicopters designed by Mil were particularly popular with the audience. These aircraft took off without first taxiing and landed vertically. They could hover in mid-air for a long time without changing their original position at all.

    The final part of the performance program was a parachuting display. Parachutists first performed delayed jumps, followed by many parachutists jumping from transport planes. As these hundreds of paratroopers slowly descended, the entire airspace above the airfield seemed to be filled with colorful flowers.

    Moscow's Aviation Day celebration demonstrated the superb skills and extraordinary training of Soviet pilots.

    苏联航空节庆祝大会在莫斯科举行
    斯大林大元帅亲临检阅航空表演
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十七日，在莫斯科的土希诺飞机场上举行苏联航空节庆祝大会。斯大林大元帅亲往参加。
    一清早，开往土希诺的火车、汽车、公共汽车和电车满载乘客驶往飞机场。莫斯科的街道都用空军的旗帜装饰起来。在装饰得一片节日气象的绿色的飞机场上，有几十万人等着看苏联航空员、滑翔机驾驶员和跳伞员的表演。
    在欢乐的歌声中，伟大的斯大林出现在检阅台上。这时，雷鸣般的欢呼声震动了整个的飞机场。
    二时正，响亮的号角宣布空军大检阅开始。庄严的苏联国歌声和礼炮声齐鸣。千万人的眼睛凝视着远方的天空，许多飞机正在排空而来。飞机上带着一面有斯大林像的红旗、空军的军旗、苏联各加盟共和国的国旗和上面写着“向着共产主义前进”的标语的大旗。这批飞机刚刚飞过，将近一百架的体育机就飞到了机场上空。这些飞机都是由业余的飞行员——工人、工程师和学生——驾驶的，它们排成“光荣归于斯大林”的字样飞过机场。
    庆祝会的表演节目分为三部分。第一部分是苏联滑翔驾驶员的表演，莫斯科人和苏联其他城市的运动员都参加了。苏联陆海空军辅助协会的学员表现了他们在飞机和滑翔机的编队飞行方面的技巧。他们整齐地表演了最复杂的技巧——翻跟斗、横滚和盘旋。观众一致赞扬以苏联英雄契齐涅娃为首的一队女航空员的熟练技巧。三十二个业余飞行员驾着轻型体育飞机，由世界纪录保持者格洛瓦诺夫带头，作了一连串精彩表演。这批飞机飞走之后，一队滑翔机在天空出现了，为首的是有名的女运动员拉森斯卡雅。这些滑翔机是安东诺夫设计的，驾驶员在空中无声无息地飞行着，显示出他们纯熟的技巧和精确性。
    第二部分是苏联空军表演。苏联飞行员是全世界首先掌握喷气机的特技飞行的。机场上的观众看到驾驶员的熟练、勇敢和无畏精神，莫不为苏维埃祖国这些勇敢的儿子感到骄傲。米高扬设计的喷气飞机跟着出现了。它们的速度是那样快，连眼睛都赶不上看它们。喷气飞机的迎面飞行的确是一个惊心动魄的场面。两队飞机以眩目的速度彼此迎面飞来，飞近了，又分开了。一架架的飞机在打滚、翻跟斗，一直冲入高空里。接着是战斗机编队的飞行表演。米高扬设计的战斗机编成五架一队和九架一队，进行表演。观众狂热地为“斯大林之鹰”欢呼。接着，一队队苏联优秀设计师杜波列夫·伊柳新和米高扬等人设计的飞机飞过机场。米尔设计的直升飞机特别受到观众欢迎。这种飞机起飞时不用先滑行一段路程，降落时是垂直地落下。它们可以停在半空中很久，一点也不改变原来的位置。
    表演节目的最后一部分是跳伞表演。跳伞员首先表演迟缓跳伞，接着许多跳伞员从运输机纷纷跳出来。当这好几百名伞兵慢慢落下来的时候，整个飞机场上空好像布满了五颜六色的花朵。
    莫斯科的航空节庆祝大会，显示了苏联飞行员的娴熟技术和非凡的训练。
