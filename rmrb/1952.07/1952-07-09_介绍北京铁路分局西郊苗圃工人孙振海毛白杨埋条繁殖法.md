    Introducing Sun Zhenhai's Populus tomentosa Propagation Method by Trenching, Developed by a Worker at the Western Suburbs Nursery of the Beijing Railway Bureau
    Jin Yu
    I. Populus tomentosa is an Excellent Tree Species
    Sun Zhenhai, a worker at the Western Suburbs Nursery of the Beijing Railway Bureau, has created a new method of propagating Populus tomentosa—trenching propagation—after three years of dedicated research and experimentation.
    Populus tomentosa is a tree species with a beautiful appearance and excellent timber. Its trunk is straight, and it grows rapidly (reaching maturity in about twenty years). It is suitable for growth in sandy loam soil and is one of the important tree species in China for creating protective forests and planting along urban avenues, highways, and railways. The wood of Populus tomentosa is light and soft with a fine and even texture, making it a good raw material for manufacturing paper pulp and matchsticks. It can also be used as general building material and for making furniture.
    Populus tomentosa is suitable for planting in vast areas of China. It can be planted in Hebei, the plains, and parts of Shanxi and Chahar in North China; Henan in Central and Southern China; Shaanxi in Northwest China; and Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces in East China.
    II. Difficulties in Propagating Populus tomentosa in the Past
    Populus tomentosa is a good tree species, but propagation has been relatively difficult. It is dioecious, with very few female plants. Therefore, asexual propagation methods such as cuttings, budding, and root division are commonly used in various regions. These methods have several drawbacks: the survival rate of cuttings is low, and although the survival rate of root division is very high, it is not easy to obtain a large number of roots; the survival rate of budding can reach 70% to 80%, but this method is complicated, requires skilled techniques, increases the cost of seedling cultivation, and is not easy to promote universally.
    III. How Sun Zhenhai Overcame the Difficulties
    Sun Zhenhai is a nursery worker with thirty-six years of experience. Like many farmers and forestry workers in our country, he greatly admires Populus tomentosa but is troubled by the difficulty of propagating it. Therefore, he began conducting propagation experiments two years before the liberation of Beijing. At that time, his research on this problem was purely out of personal interest. He would study it when he was in the mood and put it aside when he was not. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the nursery had no specific seedling cultivation tasks, and few people asked them for seedlings. In order to find a market for the seedlings, they sometimes sent some to relevant departments, but the seedlings were burned as firewood. These facts made Sun Zhenhai feel that the future of seedling cultivation was bleak, so he lost interest in researching the propagation of Populus tomentosa.
    After the liberation of Beijing, the once-neglected nursery gradually became lively. Personnel from construction departments often came to buy seedlings, and they often specifically asked for Populus tomentosa seedlings. Sun Zhenhai thought: The country needs these seedlings, so I should propagate them in large quantities. With the assistance of Liu Xinya, the director of the nursery, he began re-experimenting with his new propagation method in the spring of 1949. After a year of experimentation, he and Liu Xinya both confirmed that the experiment was successful.
    Sun Zhenhai previously used spring cuttings to propagate Populus tomentosa, but because the survival rate was too low, he switched to using winter cuttings with spring insertion. This method improved the survival rate of the seedlings. Sun Zhenhai continued to research, hoping to further improve the survival rate. Once, he was checking a cutting inserted using this method and found that the cutting not only grew new roots on the newly formed tissue (callus) at the cut but also grew new roots in several parts of the bark. At the same time, he found that two buds at the top of the mother branch had grown new leaves, and a bud closer to the soil surface had also emerged from the bark. At this point, he thought that if the mother branch was buried horizontally in the seedling bed, many buds on the branch would sprout, and roots would grow at the bottom of the branch and at the cut. This could yield a lot of seedlings. Based on this hypothesis, he conducted experiments and finally created this new method of propagating Populus tomentosa.
    IV. Sun Zhenhai's Trenching Propagation Method
    Sun Zhenhai's trenching propagation method is simple and easy to implement. The entire process involves the following steps: 1. In early winter, after the leaves of the Populus tomentosa have fallen, collect the current year's mother branches that are the thickness of an index finger (any length is acceptable, but those over four feet are best), and bury them in a pit, covering them with five inches of soil, then water them thoroughly until they freeze; 2. The following spring (late March), take the branches out of the pit and bury them horizontally in the prepared sandy loam soil seedling bed (about five minutes deep), and water them once, then keep the bed moist regularly. After about half a month, the branches will sprout and take root in succession, and new tissue will gradually grow at the cut; 3. When the seedlings grow to three or four inches, thin them out as needed, and then pay attention to removing the axillary buds of the seedlings; 4. In early winter, after the leaves have fallen, cut down all the branches and bury them for continued propagation; the seedling bed where the branches were cut will produce many strong seedlings the following spring, which can grow into seedlings more than five feet tall by autumn; 5. In the third spring, before the seedlings sprout, dig out the severed roots (i.e., the original mother branches buried underground) and transplant them. If you do not transplant, you can also sever the roots in the original bed. After severing the roots, the seedlings will be managed for another year, and in the fourth spring, they can be cultivated into seedlings about one zhang [~10 feet] tall.
    V. Five Advantages of Trenching Propagation
    Based on Sun Zhenhai's experiments, it can be confirmed that trenching propagation is the best method for propagating Populus tomentosa. This method has the following five advantages:
    First, the seedling survival rate of mother branches is high, and the yield per unit area is large. With the above method of storing mother branches, each one can survive. In addition, most of the buds on each mother branch buried in the bed have the ability to sprout, and the bottom of the branch and the cut have the ability to take root, so each mother branch of about four feet can produce an average of ten buds. Calculated at one seedling every eight inches, five seedlings can be obtained. If the cutting method is used, the same mother branch can only be cut into three cuttings. Calculated at the highest survival rate of 80%, only 2.4 seedlings can be obtained, a difference of more than double.
    Due to the high seedling survival rate of mother branches, the yield per unit area of Populus tomentosa seedlings has also increased. Calculated on the basis of a ten-square-meter (including the bed back) field seedling bed in this nursery, only ninety cuttings can be inserted using the cutting method. If 80% survive, 72 seedlings can be produced. If trenching propagation is used, 100 seedlings can be produced. The yield of trenching is more than 25% higher than that of cuttings.
    Second, it saves labor and materials. It takes two workers to insert cuttings in ten seedling beds, while it only takes 0.8 workers to bury branches in ten seedling beds; it takes thirty four-foot-long mother branches (each branch trimmed to three cuttings) to insert cuttings in one seedling bed, while it only takes twenty of the same mother branches to bury branches in one bed.
    Third, the operation method is simple, making it easy to promote universally. Propagation by cutting requires cutting branches, making holes, inserting cuttings, and compacting, which not only requires more labor but also requires skilled techniques. With trenching propagation, whether it is burying branches, thinning seedlings, or severing roots, it is simple and easy to implement. General nursery workers and forestry farmers can operate it with a little learning.
    Fourth, it can continuously obtain a large number of mother branches with strong sprouting ability, making it easy to propagate quickly. Obtaining a large number of mother branches with strong sprouting ability is one of the decisive keys to propagating Populus tomentosa. With trenching propagation, the seedlings grown in the first year can be cut down in early winter and used as mother branches needed for propagation in the following year. In this way, the problem of needing a large number of mother branches is solved. At the same time, the number of mother branches can be continuously increased. For example, if twenty mother branches are used for trenching propagation, one hundred mother branches that can be used for continued propagation in the second year can be obtained in the same winter (calculated at five seedlings retained per mother branch, if more seedlings are retained, the number of mother branches obtained can be increased), and five hundred mother branches can be collected in the second winter to be prepared for propagation in the third year. If propagation continues, five times as many mother branches as the previous year can be collected each year.
    Fifth, the roots of the seedlings are developed, making them easier to survive during transplantation. Populus tomentosa seedlings cultivated by trenching propagation have a thick horizontal root (i.e., the mother branch after being cut off), and a series of lateral roots and fibrous roots under the horizontal root; the seedlings cultivated by cutting only have roots at the cut callus, and there are very few fibrous roots above the cut. The developed roots of the seedlings are conducive to the survival and growth of the seedlings, so the seedlings cultivated by this method are easier to survive during transplantation.
    VI. The Western Suburbs Nursery Has Already Used Trenching Propagation
    To Propagate Populus tomentosa Seedlings in Large Quantities
    After Sun Zhenhai's Populus tomentosa trenching propagation method was successful, the Beijing Western Suburbs Nursery has adopted it. Now the number of Populus tomentosa propagated by this nursery has been increasing year by year. The number propagated by this nursery in 1950 was 2,730 seedlings, which increased to 4,500 seedlings in 1951, and has continued to increase to 25,000 seedlings this year, and is preparing to increase to 125,000 seedlings next year.

    介绍北京铁路分局西郊苗圃工人孙振海毛白杨埋条繁殖法
    近宇
    一、毛白杨是一种优良的树种
    北京铁路分局西郊苗圃工人孙振海，经过三年的钻研试验，创造了新的毛白杨繁殖法——埋条繁殖法。
    毛白杨是一种外形美观材质优良的树种。它的身干挺直，生长迅速（约二十年左右可以成材），宜于在沙质壤土上生长，是我国目前营造防护林和在都市大道以及公路铁路两旁栽植行道树的重要树种之一。毛白杨的材质轻软、纹理匀细，是制造纸浆和火柴杆的良好原料，又可作一般建筑的用材和制造家具。
    毛白杨在我国广大地区都适于栽植。华北区的河北、平原、山西和察哈尔的部分地区，中南区的河南，西北区的陕西，华东区的山东、安徽、江苏等省，都能种植。
    二、过去繁殖毛白杨有困难
    毛白杨是一种良好的树种，但是繁殖比较困难。它是雌雄异株，而雌株极少，因此，各地常用扦插、芽接、分根等几种无性繁殖法，进行繁殖。这几种方法都有若干缺点：扦插法的成活率较低，分根的成活率虽然很高，但是不容易取得大量树根；芽接的成活率，可以达到百分之七、八十，但是用这种方法繁殖，手续繁杂，需要熟练的技术，不但育苗的成本高，而且不易普遍推广。
    三、孙振海是怎样突破困难的
    孙振海是一个有三十六年工龄的苗圃工人，他和我国广大农民、许多林业工作者一样，非常喜爱毛白杨，但苦于不易繁殖；因此，远在北京解放前二年，他就开始进行繁殖试验。那时他研究这个问题，完全是从个人兴趣出发的。高兴的时候就研究一下，不高兴就丢在一旁。在国民党反动派统治下，这个苗圃没有具体的育苗任务，很少有人向他们要树苗。他们为了寻找苗木的出路，有时给有关部门送一些，结果，送去的苗木都被当柴烧了。这些事实使孙振海感到育苗工作前途黯淡，因此也就无心研究毛白杨繁殖法了。
    北京解放以后，这个无人问津的苗圃，慢慢热闹起来。时常有建设部门的人员来买树苗，他们并且常常指名要买毛白杨苗木。孙振海想：国家需要这种树苗，我就应该大量地繁殖它。他在苗圃主任刘新亚的协助下，从一九四九年春季开始，重新试验他的新繁殖法。经过一年实验，他和刘新亚都肯定这一试验是成功了。
    孙振海以前繁殖毛白杨，采用春季扦插法，因为成活率太低，他就改用冬季采条春季扦插法。这种方法提高了树苗的成活率。孙振海继续钻研，希望进一步提高成活率。有一次，他检查一根用这种方法插的条子，发现这根条子不但在切口的新生组织
    （愈合部分）上生出了新根，而且在皮部的若干部分也生出了新根；同时发现在母树条顶端的两个芽苞已生出新叶，距土面较近的一个芽苞也已伸出皮外。这时，他想，若是把母树条横埋在苗畦内，树条上的许多芽苞都能萌发，树条下部和切断处都能生根，那就可以得到很多的树苗了。他根据这一假定进行试验，终于创造了这个新的毛白杨繁殖法。
    四、孙振海的埋条繁殖法
    孙振海埋条繁殖法是简单易行的。综合全部过程，有以下几个步骤：一、在冬初毛白杨落叶后，采集食指粗细的当年生的母树条（长短都可以，以四尺以上者为最好），把它埋藏在坑内，盖土五寸，然后灌足冻水；二、次年春季（三月下旬）从坑内取出条子，分别横埋在已经做好的沙质壤土的苗畦内（深度约五分左右），并灌水一次，以后经常保持畦内湿润。约半月后，树条次第发芽生根，树条的切断处也逐渐生出新的组织；三、在幼苗长到三、四寸时，根据需要间苗一次，以后并注意摘除树苗的腋芽；四、在冬初落叶后，把树条全部刈下埋藏，准备继续繁殖；刈下树条的苗畦在次年春季又生出许多茁壮的幼苗，到秋后就可长成五尺多高的苗木；五、在第三年春季苗木萌芽前，刨出断根（即原埋在地下的母树条），同时进行移植。如不移植，也可以在原畦内断根。经过断根后的苗木，再经过一年的管理，在第四年春季即可育成一丈左右的树苗。
    五、埋条繁殖法的五个优点
    根据孙振海的试验，可以肯定埋条繁殖法是繁殖毛白杨的最好的方法。这个方法有以下五个优点：
    第一、母树条成苗率高，单位面积产量大。用上述方法收藏的母树条，每根都能成活，加以每根埋在畦内的母树条的多数芽苞，都有萌发能力，树条切断处和下部都有生根能力，所以每一根四尺左右的母树条，平均能生十个芽，以每隔八寸留一个苗计算，可得五个幼苗。若用扦插法，同样的一根母树条只可扦插三株，以扦插的最高成活率百分之八十计算，才得树苗二点四株，两者相差一倍多。
    由于母树条成苗率高，毛白杨苗木的单位面积产量也提高了。以这个苗圃十平方公尺（带畦背）的大田苗畦计算，用扦插法只能扦插九十株，如成活百分之八十，可产苗木七十二株，用埋条法繁殖，则可以产苗木一百株，埋条的产量比扦插高百分之二十五强。
    第二、省工省料。扦插十个苗畦要用两个工，埋条十个苗畦只用零点八个工；扦插一个苗畦需用四尺长母树条三十根（每根去梢部剪成三根），埋条一畦只需同样母树条二十根。
    第三、操作方法简单，便于普遍推广。用扦插法繁殖，要经过剪条、扦穴、扦条、踩实等过程，不但需用较多的人工，并且需要熟练的技术。用埋条法繁殖，不论埋条、间苗、断根，都是简单易行，一般苗圃工人和林区农民，稍加学习，就可操作。
    第四、能陆续取得多量的萌芽力强的母树条，便于迅速繁殖。取得大量的萌芽力强的母树条，这是繁殖毛白杨工作的决定关键之一。用埋条法进行繁殖，可以把第一年生长出来的苗木在冬初刈下，当做次年繁殖所需的母树条。这样，所需大量母树条的问题就解决了。同时，母树条的数量还可以不断增加。如拿二十根母树条埋条繁殖，当年冬季就可以得到第二年继续繁殖的母树条一百根（以一根母树条留苗五株计算，若留苗多，所得母树条的数量还可以增加），第二年冬初又可以采集准备在第三年繁殖的母树条五百根。若不断繁殖下去，每年都可以采集相当前一年五倍的母树条。
    第五、苗木根部发达，在移植时更易成活。用埋条繁殖法培育出来的毛白杨苗木，有一粗壮的横根（即经过切断后的母树条），横根下部有一连串的侧根和须根；用扦插法育成的苗木，除切口愈合处有根外，切口上部的须根则寥寥无几。苗木根部发达，有利于苗木成活和生长，因此，用这一方法育成的苗木，在移植时是更容易成活的。
    六、西郊苗圃已用埋条繁殖法
    大量地繁殖毛白杨苗木
    孙振海的毛白杨埋条繁殖法试验成功后，北京西郊苗圃已经加以采用。现在这个苗圃繁殖毛白杨的数量已逐年增多。这个苗圃一九五○年繁殖的数量是二千七百三十株，一九五一年增加为四千五百株，今年已继续增加为二万五千株，准备明年增加为十二万五千株。（附图片）
