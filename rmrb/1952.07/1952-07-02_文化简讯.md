	Cultural Briefs
	▲ The eleventh issue of "New Observer," published on July 1st, features a bas-relief of Chairman Mao on the cover and an oil painting titled "Chairman Mao Working in a Cave Dwelling" inside the front cover. Articles commemorating the 31st anniversary of the great Communist Party of China include Xie Juezai's "First Meeting with Chairman Mao," He Changgong's "Recollections of Comrade Zhang Ziqing, a Comrade-in-Arms on Jinggang Mountain," and Shuai Mengqi's "An Unforgettable Event." Xie Juezai's article points out that Chairman Mao was investigating social conditions in the counties along Dongting Lake in 1920 while also reading extensively. He Changgong's article, in addition to recalling a resourceful and courageous Communist Party member who made special contributions to the meeting of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, also provides some specific details about the situation of the struggle on Jinggang Mountain at that time.
	In addition, under the general theme of "Learn Economic Work to Greet Large-Scale Economic Construction," the publication commissioned four Communist Party members engaged in economic work to write about their experiences in learning economic work.
	▲ The compilation and translation of textbooks in minority languages in Xinjiang has achieved considerable success. From 1951 to May 1952, a total of 686,300 copies of various textbooks in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian have been published; another 1,885,400 copies are scheduled to be published in the second half of this year, bringing the total to more than 2.5 million copies. Such a large-scale printing of textbooks in minority languages is only possible under the new democratic political conditions. The publication of these textbooks is of great significance to the construction of Xinjiang. However, due to the shortage of personnel for writing and translating textbooks in minority languages in Xinjiang, the current needs cannot yet be met, and relevant departments must continue to work hard to solve this problem.

    ▲七月一日出版的新观察第十一期，封面是毛主席浮雕像，封里是题为“毛主席在窑洞里工作”的油画。纪念伟大的中国共产党三十一周年的文章，有谢觉哉的“第一次会见毛主席”，何长工的“回忆井冈山上的战友张子清同志”和帅孟奇的“一件永远不会忘记的事”。谢觉哉的文章指出，毛主席一九二○年就在洞庭湖边各县考察社会情况，同时博览书籍。何长工的文章除了回忆一位智勇兼备、对毛主席和朱总司令会师有特殊功绩的共产党员外，对当时井冈山的斗争形势，也提供了一部分具体情况。
    此外，该刊在“学会经济工作迎接大规模的经济建设”总题下，特约了四位做经济工作的共产党员著文，谈他们学习经济工作的经过。
    ▲新疆少数民族语文课本的编译工作已经获得相当成绩。从一九五一年到一九五二年五月止，已经出版的维吾尔文、哈萨克文、蒙古文各种课本共六十八万六千三百册；即将在本年下半年出版的有一百八十八万五千四百册，二者合计达二百五十余万册。这样大规模印行少数民族语文课本，只有在新民主主义的政治条件下才有可能。这些课本的印行，对于新疆的建设有极大的意义。但目前新疆少数民族的语文课本由于编写翻译人才不足，仍然不能满足需要，有关部门还须继续努力解决。
