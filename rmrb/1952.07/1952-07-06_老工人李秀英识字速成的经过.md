I.

When I visited the Chinese Textile Workers' Union's Accelerated Literacy Method Training Class, the class was nearing completion, and the students were writing letters to Chairman Mao. Li Xiuying, a female worker from Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, was almost finished with her letter. Xu Long, a student from the Subei District in her study group, told me, "Li Xiuying has been writing this letter for a full four hours. When she remembers her past miserable life and the pain of being illiterate, she gets so upset that she can't continue writing!" Li Xiuying's letter read:

Respected Chairman Mao:

I have been working since I was eight years old. I suffered a lot in the factory in the past, oppressed by foremen, working twelve hours a day, living like an animal, and not even getting enough to eat. After liberation, life has gotten better day by day. We workers have turned over and become masters of our own house. Our political and technical skills have improved, but it's really hard to be without culture! I am so happy to be in the Accelerated Literacy Method Training Class to learn culture. Originally, I only knew a hundred characters, but after more than twenty days, I have learned more than two thousand characters and can read and write. I owe my present situation to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. After I return to the factory, I will unite the workers, work hard in production, and build a new China to better repay the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. After she finished writing the letter, she wiped away her tears and smiled excitedly.

II.

Li Xiuying is a roving worker in the fine yarn workshop of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, and she is thirty-seven years old this year. Since she entered the yarn mill at the age of eight, she has often been beaten and scolded, and she has been working on an empty stomach every day. After the liberation of Wuhan, Li Xiuying actively participated in various activities in the factory and understood many principles. Because of her active production and her ability to unite and help the masses, the workers elected her as the production team leader; soon, she was elected as the vice-chairman of the workshop trade union and a member of the factory management committee. The fine yarn workshop where Li Xiuying was located quickly became a model workshop in the factory under her and all the workshop workers' joint efforts.

Since Li Xiuying became the vice-chairman of the trade union, one problem has often caused her anxiety and unease. For example, when the factory issued a notice of a meeting, she had to go around looking for someone to read it to her; sometimes she had to report her work, and she thought very carefully before leaving, but when she reported, she forgot most of it; when she conveyed the instructions from the higher authorities in the workshop, she either forgot this or dropped that; sometimes the workers raised many problems in production that needed to be solved immediately, and she remembered them very clearly at the time, but if she was disturbed by other problems, she couldn't remember them anymore. Problems like this often bothered her so much that she couldn't eat or sleep well. She thought: How much loss does the lack of culture cause to work! But learning culture, at such an old age, and being the mother of three daughters, can her brain work? Even if she went to the workers' night school, learning three or five words a day, when would she be able to learn it?

III.

One afternoon, Li Xiuying was working in the workshop, and Comrade Yu, the cultural and educational committee member of the trade union, walked in with a smile and said to Li Xiuying, "The higher authorities have decided to transfer you to Qingdao to participate in the study of the Accelerated Literacy Method. After studying there for a month, you will be able to learn more than two thousand characters and be able to read and write. Are you willing to go?" Li Xiuying thought of how much pain she had suffered in the past because she was illiterate, and now the higher authorities had decided that she would go to Qingdao to learn culture, which was something she never dreamed of! She immediately agreed happily. However, when she set off, new concerns arose in her mind: she was in her thirties, and if she couldn't learn it in a month, how could she live up to the care and cultivation of the Party and the higher authorities! After arriving at the training class, at the first group discussion meeting, students from all over the country talked about their study plans. Li Xiuying heard that some of the students originally knew two hundred, three hundred, or four hundred characters, and they all guaranteed to learn two thousand four hundred characters in a month. What about herself? She only knew a hundred characters originally. She considered it for a long time and felt that she was not sure about learning, so she did not dare to express her attitude at the meeting.

The official opening of the school was on May 13. At the opening ceremony, many responsible comrades explained the benefits of the Accelerated Literacy Method; Wang Xiuzhen, a fine yarn worker from Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, introduced her learning experience in the Tianjin training class, from being illiterate to being able to read newspapers and periodicals. Wang Xiuzhen said: "As long as you have confidence, determination, and work hard, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Ma Ruiqi, the teacher of the training class, also said that he would guarantee to teach everyone. Li Xiuying was greatly moved at the meeting, and she secretly blamed herself, saying: "People have learned it because they have determination, and the teacher has also made a guarantee, why don't I dare to guarantee it?" She also thought: she had never bowed her head to difficulties in production in the past, and she must never let herself fall behind in this cultural learning! Once she made up her mind, she talked about her ideological changes and concerns in the group, and expressed at the meeting: she would never bow her head to any difficulties, and she must learn it well and remember it firmly!

IV.

After the study began, Li Xiuying encountered many new difficulties, but she overcame all of them. For example, young students could learn three hundred characters a day, but she could only learn two hundred and fifty characters a day. She used her rest time to seriously make up for and review; and she often actively sought help from teachers and other students. In this way, she gradually kept up with the young students.

She often heard the teacher say: "To ensure the completion of the study plan, not only must you have confidence and determination, but your mind must also be highly concentrated, and you must use your brain a lot." Therefore, she listened carefully every time in class, remembered carefully, and seized the time to review after class.

When learning pinyin, the pronunciation of the characters she made was always inaccurate. She could only follow the teacher to spell in class. When she practiced spelling by herself after class, she spent a lot of effort, but she could not spell the correct pronunciation of the characters. At this time, she listened carefully to others spelling in the study group and checked the shortcomings of her own pronunciation. She suddenly remembered the "essentials" of pinyin that the teacher had said in class: "The first sound is light and short, the second sound is heavy, spell and read quickly, and boldly affirm the sound." She spelled according to the "essentials" and quickly became familiar with it.

After two weeks of study, Li Xiuying had broken through two thousand and four hundred new characters. At that time, she was so happy that she often could not sleep well at night, repeatedly thinking about the new characters she had learned in the literacy textbook; when others were already asleep, she quietly lay on the window, taking advantage of the street light outside the window to review. In the process of breaking through and reviewing new characters, she used phonetic symbols to help remember the pronunciation of the characters, and at the same time, she "looked at" the characters and analyzed the shape of the characters. For example, when memorizing the character "杆" (pole), she looked at this character for a long time, first memorizing the "干" (dry) below the character "杆". She thought: the thing below (referring to "干") looks like a telephone pole, and this character is the "杆" character of telephone pole; she could not remember the character "轰" (boom) after reading it several times, and later she thought that if there were too many cars, they would make a rumbling sound when they drove, so she firmly remembered the character "轰". When learning approached the reading stage, in order to firmly remember the new characters, she read the new characters in the new character textbook from top to bottom, from left to right, or from bottom to top, and then from right to left several times. Li Xiuying said: "If you read it so well and remember it, you won't read it as a tongue twister."

When entering the reading textbook, new difficulties came again. The characters in the workers' culture textbook were several times smaller than the characters in the literacy textbook. Li Xiuying had ruined her eyes from working the night shift in the factory in the past, so it was very difficult to read such small characters; when she was anxious, sparks would fly in her eyes, and she could not recognize the characters even more. Later, she adopted the method the teacher told her: read calmly. In this way, she gradually recognized all the characters in the workers' culture textbook.

In the reading stage, she read many popular books and revolutionary stories, such as "The Red Army's 25,000-Li Long March" and "Liu Hulan," and was deeply moved. She said: "With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, I, an almost forty-year-old blind woman, have opened my eyes again to recognize characters and understand things."

When the training class was about to graduate, Li Xiuying had memorized two thousand four hundred characters, and she could read general popular books and newspapers and periodicals, and she could also write short articles. Because Li Xiuying was able to work hard, actively study, and constantly overcome difficulties during her studies and achieved excellent academic results, she was honorably selected as a study model for the entire class.

    老工人李秀英识字速成的经过
　　新华社记者  台旭
    一
    当我到中国纺织工会速成识字法学习班访问的时候，学习班已快要结业，学员们正在给毛主席写信。武汉市第一纱厂女工李秀英的信快写完了。和她同在一个学习小组里的苏北区学员徐隆告诉我：“李秀英这封信足足写了四个钟头了，她想起过去悲惨的生活和不识字的苦楚，就难过得写不下去哩！”李秀英的信写道：
    敬爱的毛主席：
    我从八岁做工，在工厂里从前受了许多痛苦，受工头压迫，每天做十二小时工，过着牛马般的生活，连饭也吃不饱。解放了，生活一天比一天好了，我们工人翻身当家做主人，政治技术都提高了，就是没得文化真苦！这次我来到速成识字法学习班学文化真高兴，原来我只认识一百个字，经过二十多天，我已认识两千多字，能看书写字了。我能有今天，就是毛主席、共产党给我的，我回厂后要团结职工，努力生产，建设新中国。更好地来报答毛主席和共产党的恩情。她把信写完以后，用手拭了拭眼泪，兴奋地笑起来了。
    二
    李秀英是武汉市第一纱厂细纱间的看车工，今年三十七岁。她从八岁进纱厂做工以后，就经常挨打受骂，天天饿着肚子干活。武汉解放后，李秀英在工厂里积极参加各种活动，懂得了很多道理。由于她的生产积极，能够团结和帮助群众，工友们便选她当生产小组长；不久，她又被选为车间工会副主席和工厂管理委员会委员。李秀英所在的细纱车间，在她和全车间工友的共同努力下很快地成为全厂的模范车间。
    李秀英自从当上工会副主席以后，有一个问题常常引起她的焦躁和不安。譬如：厂里发了开会的通知，她要到处找人念给她听；有时她要去汇报工作，临走前想的很周到，等到汇报的时候就忘了一大半；在车间里传达上级的指示，不是忘掉这个，就是丢了那个；有时工友们在生产上提出了许多马上需要解决的问题，当时记得很清楚，可是有别的问题一打扰，再也就想不起来了。像这样的问题经常使她烦恼得吃不下饭，睡不好觉。她想：没有文化使工作受多大的损失啊！可是学习文化，这么大的岁数，又是三个女儿的妈妈了，脑筋能行吗？就是上了职工夜校，一天学三、五个字，几时才能学成呢？
    三
    有一天下午，李秀英正在车间里做工，工会文教委员于同志笑咪咪地走进来，向李秀英说：“上级决定调你到青岛去参加速成识字法的学习，到那里学习一个月后就能学会两千多字，能看书写字了。你愿意去吗？”李秀英想起过去因为自己不识字，不知受到了多少痛苦，现在上级决定自己去青岛学习文化，真是做梦也没想到过的事！她立即愉快地答应了。可是，当她起程的时候，脑子里又产生了新的顾虑：自己是三十多岁的人了，一个月如果学不会又怎么能对得起党和上级的关心培养呢！到学习班后，在第一次小组座谈会上，各地来的学员都谈了自己的学习计划，李秀英听到学员中原来有能识二百、三百到四百字的，他们都保证要在一个月内学会两千四百字。自己呢？原来只认识一百字。她考虑了很久，感到学习还没有把握，因而在会上不敢表示态度。
    五月十三日正式开学了，在开学典礼大会上，许多负责同志都讲解了速成识字法的好处；天津国棉二厂细纱工人王秀珍介绍她在天津参加学习班，从不识字到能够阅读书报的学习经过。王秀珍说：“只要有信心，有决心，努力学习，没有克服不了的困难。”学习班的教员马瑞骐也表示要保证教会大家。李秀英在会上受到很大的感动，她暗地里责备自己说：“人家有决心就学会了，老师也作了保证，自己为什么还不敢保证呢？”她又想到：过去在生产上从来没有向困难低过头，这次学文化也绝不能使自己掉队！决心下定了，在小组里她谈出了自己思想变化和顾虑，并在会上表示：绝不向任何困难低头，一定要把它学得好、记得牢！
    四
    学习开始后，李秀英碰到许多新的困难；但所有的困难，她都战胜了。例如，青年学员一天能识三百字，但她一天只能识二百五十字。她便利用休息时间，认真补习和温读；并经常主动地争取教师和其他学员的帮助。这样她就渐渐地能跟上年青的学员了。
    她常常听到老师讲：“要保证完成学习计划，不仅要有信心和决心，思想还必须高度集中，要多多地开动脑筋。”因此，每次上课她都用心听，用心记，下课后就抓紧时间温习。
    在学习拼音的时候，李秀英发出的字音老是不准确。她只能在课堂上跟着老师拼，下课后自己练习拼的时候费了很大的力气，也拼不出字的正音来。这时，她便在学习小组里专心听别人拼，同时检查自己发音的缺点。她忽然想起了老师在课堂上讲的拼音“要领”：“前音轻短、后音重、快拼快念、大胆肯定音”，她根据“要领”来拼，很快也就拼熟了。
    经过两周的学习，李秀英已突击了二千四百个生字。那时她高兴得夜里常睡不好觉，反复地想着识字课本上学到的生字；别人已经睡熟了，她便悄悄地伏在窗前，趁着窗外的路灯灯光温习。在突击生字和复习中，她一面用注音符号帮助记字音，同时给字“相面”，分析字形；如在记忆“杆”字时，她将这个字端详了好久以后，先把“杆”字下面的“干”记住了。她想：下面这个东西（指“干”）像根电线杆子，这个字就是电线杆子的“杆”字；“轰”字念了好几次都记不住，以后她便想到车子多了走起来就轰隆轰隆地直响，便把“轰”字牢牢地记住了。学习接近阅读阶段的时候，为了牢记生字，她就把生字课本上的生字从上到下、从左到右或者从下而上，再从右到左的多念两遍。李秀英说：“这样念熟记住，就不会把它们念成顺口溜了。”
    进入阅读课本的时候，新的困难又来了。工人文化课本上的字比识字课本上字小了好几倍，李秀英因为过去在工厂里做夜工把眼熬坏了，看这样小的字很吃力；她一着急眼里就直冒火星，字也就越认不出来。后来她采取了教师告诉她的办法：平心静气地读。这样她就渐渐地把工人文化课本上的字都认出来了。
    在阅读阶段，她读了许多通俗读物和革命故事，如“红军两万五千里长征”、“刘胡兰”等，受到了深刻的感动。她说：“有了毛主席的英明领导，我这将近四十岁的瞎婆子，又睁开眼识得字懂得事了。”
    到学习班结业的时候，李秀英已记熟了两千四百个字，并能够阅读一般通俗读物和报刊，也会写短文了。由于李秀英在学习期间，能刻苦用功，积极钻研，不断地克服困难并获得了优良的学习成绩，她已光荣地被选为全班的学习模范。
