    Long Live the Great Chinese Communist Party
    Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese Communist Party
    In January 1935, the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, removing the leadership positions of "Left-leaning" opportunists and establishing Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in the entire Party. This is the location where Comrade Mao Zedong gave his report during the Zunyi Conference. (Photo by Xiao Hongkui of Xinhua Daily)
    On July 1, 1921, communist groups from all over China elected twelve representatives and held their first congress in Shanghai, forming the Chinese Communist Party. This is the exterior view of the site where the congress was held. The address was 108 Wangzhi Road (now 78 Xingye Road) in Shanghai. The meeting was held upstairs in this building.

    From the winter of 1935, after the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party arrived in northern Shaanxi, until 1947, Yan'an became the lighthouse of the Chinese people's revolution. This is a corner of Yan'an, where the Central Committee of the CPC was located at the time. (Submitted by Beijing Film Studio)
    The Chinese people respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions at all times. This is the scene on April 24, 1945, when Chairman Mao delivered the political report "On Coalition Government." Today, the Chinese people are realizing the call made by Chairman Mao in this report.

    In the successive great economic and political struggles of the Chinese working class, many communists heroically and selflessly stood at the forefront of the struggle, becoming leaders of the masses. This is the scene of Comrade Lin Xiangqian, one of the leaders of the "February 7th" Great Strike in 1923, sacrificing heroically in Jiang'an. (Oil painting by Li Tianxiang)
    The Chinese People's Volunteers are composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. In every battle, the communist party members played an active exemplary role and successfully completed their combat missions. This is the scene of commanders of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army studying the terrain after studying the combat plan. Standing on the left is the combat hero Li Guoying.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, many communists are determined to train themselves to become good sons and daughters of the Party. This is Chairman Mao signing autographs for industrial labor model Gong Jinmei and factory protection model Zhao Guilan, among others. (Photo by Hou Bo)
    In the long struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party for the Chinese peasants to eliminate the feudal land system, many communists became leaders of the peasant movement.

    In addition to firmly shouldering the task of defending the security of the motherland, all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically launching a cultural learning campaign, and many model deeds have emerged.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the national working class fully utilized their labor enthusiasm to build a great motherland, and countless labor models have emerged.

    In order to meet the needs of the great construction cause of the motherland, a large number of outstanding communists from worker and peasant backgrounds participated in studies at advanced schools. This is the scene of industrial labor model Zhu Guohua (left) and Zhang Yichang (right) studying on their own at Renmin University. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "get organized and develop production," the broad masses of peasants across the country have launched large-scale high-yield competitions.
