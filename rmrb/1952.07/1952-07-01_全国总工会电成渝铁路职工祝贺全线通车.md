　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to all workers of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to congratulate them on the completion of the entire line. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　To the Chongqing Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, forwarded to all workers of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway:

　　Holding a celebration ceremony for the completion of the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the great festival commemorating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China is of great significance. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is something the people of Sichuan shed blood and sacrificed for decades ago without achieving. Today, after the people themselves have seized power, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, thanks to the high level of labor enthusiasm displayed by all of you, the entire line has been opened to traffic in just two short years. This fully proves the superiority of the New Democratic system. We hope that you will continue to maintain a high degree of labor enthusiasm and strive to complete new tasks.

　　Long live all the railway construction workers!
　　Long live the Communist Party of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions June 28, 1952

    全国总工会电成渝铁路职工祝贺全线通车
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国总工会为成渝铁路全线通车，致电该路全体职工祝贺。电文如下：
    重庆中华全国总工会西南办事处转成渝铁路全体职工：
    在纪念中国共产党成立三十一周年伟大节日的时候，举行庆祝成渝铁路全线通车典礼，是有重大意义的。成渝铁路的修建是四川人民数十年前曾流血牺牲而没有实现的，今天在人民自己掌握了政权之后，在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导之下，由于你们全体职工发挥了高度的劳动热忱，短短的两年时间内就全线通车了，这充分证明了新民主主义制度的优越性。希望你们继续保持高度劳动热忱，为完成新的任务而奋斗。
    全体筑路职工万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华全国总工会    一九五二年六月二十八日
