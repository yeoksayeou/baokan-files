    Forty Nights
    ——Visiting Zeng Duanyi, One of the Creators of the New Writing Method
    Wu Ming
    At the Third Cultural Teaching Representatives Conference of the South China Military Region, I visited Comrade Zeng Duanyi, an outstanding female teacher in the military. She is a member of the Communist Youth League and was named a first-class youth model teacher this year on "May Fourth." She, along with another cultural teacher, Comrade Tang Bin, and cultural education cadre, Comrade Zhou Bin, explored and created a relatively systematic new writing method. This new writing method has been welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters in the military and is currently being promoted and implemented throughout the entire army. The commendation order from the South China Military Region to her (and them) pointed out that this method "…shortens the time for practicing writing in the troops and greatly contributes to concentrating efforts on writing. This spirit of revolutionary heroism and creativity is worthy of praise. And it calls on the entire army to learn from them…."
    Comrade Zeng Duanyi is a young woman who is not yet twenty years old, and from her appearance, she looks even younger than her age. She is full of youthful vitality, has a high degree of love for the soldiers, and has a selfless spirit towards her work. People who meet her for the first time will be surprised why someone like her, whose cultural level is not very high (graduated from junior high school and attended an agricultural school for another year), not very old, and with not much teaching experience, would have such a significant creation.
    She told me with a smile:
    "Indeed, from my personal point of view, there is nothing more worth telling people. I only came to the army at the beginning of last year. As soon as I arrived, I was moved by the soldiers' simple and sincere enthusiasm. The soldiers not only helped me in life but also constantly enlightened me with their high level of class consciousness. In the past year or so, I have indeed made a lot of progress. I have repeatedly made meritorious service in my work, but this should mainly be attributed to the Party's training and the army's training. I have only initially done what I should do. As for the exploration and creation process of this new writing method, it is like this: After the troops launched cultural learning with the quick literacy method, the soldiers quickly gained reading ability. They read various books and newspapers in large quantities, so diligently and seriously, like 'eating books.' But every time I went to the class, the soldiers still asked me to write letters and summaries for them. I said, haven't you learned a lot of characters? Practice writing yourself! They looked at their hands and shook their heads. Comrade Zhou Shijia said: 'We have only learned to recognize characters, not to write. We are still like a dumb person who can only listen to others speak but cannot speak for themselves.'"
    Comrade Zhou Shijia's words greatly moved this female teacher in the army. She asked the soldiers what their difficulties were in writing. The soldiers said, "We don't know how to write. There are so many characters, and unlike quick literacy, there is no 'crutch.' Who knows which one to write first?" Zeng Duanyi saw the soldiers sweating profusely when they were writing, their hands trembling, holding the pen so hard. She said, "I was secretly worried that the soldiers would break the pens!" She was very anxious for them, so she held Li Yaodong's hand to teach him. Li Yaodong's strong hand was twice as thick as hers, and she couldn't hold it firmly. Both of them were covered in sweat, but he still couldn't write well. She said, "This is not a solution! But can you say that the soldiers are clumsy? That's not true! Look at how skillfully they handle their weapons! We should teach the soldiers to write like they handle their weapons."
    She thought of going to the Xinhua Bookstore to find some books on writing to study and solve the problem, but she was disappointed. She also thought of her own experience of learning to write when she was a child, tracing, writing imitations…, how could she use this to teach the soldiers? But the general rules of writing, such as from top to bottom, from left to right, horizontal strokes are flat and vertical strokes are straight, etc., can't be simplified into a writing method that is practical for workers, peasants, and soldiers, can they? Others often told her, "There is no secret to writing, just write and practice more!" She said, "That's right, but we need to be quicker…," so she began to think about ways to solve this problem. She first studied one of the basic characteristics of Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method: dispersing difficulties, from easy to difficult. Writing should also be like this! She also carefully observed the soldiers' practice: looking at one stroke and writing one stroke, not remembering the shape of the character, most easily adding strokes, missing strokes, writing wrong, and after writing for a while, their necks were sore, their little fingers were sticking to the paper and not flexible; they used too much force to hold the pen, easily getting tired; they didn't understand the strokes that make up the characters, writing slowly, not knowing how to start, and writing in different sizes…. She also thought that the soldiers' exercises on the playground all started with basic movements, and writing should also start with basic strokes.
    "I must help the soldiers solve the difficulties in writing!" Zeng Duanyi made up her mind. She thought about it while eating and while walking. She really wanted to try out the methods she had come up with, but she was afraid of disrupting the entire learning process. She had to write down what she thought of after 11 o'clock at night. Four days later, the material was written, and she took this draft of the new writing method to the regimental education section for review. But when she reached the door of the education section, she retreated again. She thought, "What if the comrades in the education section say: you can't even write well yourself, and you want to create a writing method, what should I do?… No! No, they will definitely help me." Sure enough, the head of the education section listened to her report with great pleasure and gave her a few words of encouragement. She was really a little embarrassed! The head of the section also told her that Comrade Tang Bin, a cultural teacher from the Seventh Company, was also studying this issue, so the two of them worked together, still using the nighttime. First, they analyzed that Chinese characters have only "eight major parts," then summarized several key points of stroke order, and then selected more than seventy kinds of character radicals, character tops, character frames, and character bottoms, and initially planned the writing method. They then separately found two groups of people who had never written before to experiment. After four hours of separate teaching with the old and new methods, one group that did not use their method could only write ninety characters in one hour. The group using this method could write one hundred characters in twenty minutes, and the fastest could write one hundred characters in nine minutes.
    The success of the initial experiment further strengthened Zeng Duanyi's belief. In order to enable the soldiers to better understand the meaning of the characters based on the radicals and distinguish between homophones and homographs, she took the initiative to sort out a single-character book, opening seven night shifts in a row, and two thousand four hundred single characters were sorted out. For key practice, she also found two hundred and seventy different single characters. In this way, the new writing method was created after being sorted out by Comrade Zhou Bin, the cultural education officer of the department.
    From the beginning of the sorting to the complete completion, she spent a total of forty nights, going to bed late every day. During the day, she also undertook the teaching tasks of two classes. At that time, it was the consolidation stage of the literacy campaign, and all the teachers were nervously breathless. During the day, she was as busy as everyone else. After midnight, she dragged her tired body and began the research on the writing method. After one or two o'clock, her waist ached and her joints hurt. The most annoying thing was that her eyes didn't listen to her commands. Sometimes she wrote for a long time and didn't know what she was writing. Sometimes she fell asleep with the pen in her hand, and when she woke up, the ink stained the paper. But she did not interrupt her sorting and research because of fatigue. She slapped her head hard a few times and started writing again. When she was really too sleepy, she lay on the bed for a temporary rest, but as soon as she closed her eyes, she seemed to see the soldiers beside her, struggling with their pens, worrying about writing; when she opened her eyes, the flickering light shone on the smiling picture of Chairman Mao on her bedside, and she immediately felt that Chairman Mao was watching her work, so her spirits came, and she picked up her pen again. On several nights, she felt that it was not early, let's rest for a while, but before she lay down, the wake-up call outside rang. She quickly packed up what she had written, picked up the textbook, walked into the classroom, and began her day's teaching work.
    "You ask me if I can handle working day and night like this?" Zeng Duanyi said calmly, "Yes, I got sick from being tired. Once, while I was teaching, I felt dizzy, my eyes went black, and I was shaking all over. I was about to fall down when two soldiers came up and hugged me. They said, 'Your lips are white, good teacher, you rest, we promise to learn well!' But when I looked up, I saw the slogan on the wall: Learn one more character, it is equal to destroying one more enemy! I wrote this myself, I can't leave the classroom, I told the soldiers: I can't stand, I can teach sitting down, if you ask me to leave you to rest, it's more uncomfortable than anything else. I was sick for three days, and only ate a bowl of porridge, but I didn't miss a single class."
    "You ask me what power is supporting me?" Zeng Duanyi smiled again: "Why don't you ask those people who are struggling hard on the Korean battlefield why? Why don't you ask our soldiers why they have such a diligent and hard-working selfless spirit? Wang Yushan, the hero who blocked the enemy's gun with his body, didn't he also participate in the battle while sick? Didn't Guo Junqing also faint on the battlefield? Compared to them, what is it to be a little tired and a little sick? I tell you: If you can deeply understand the soldiers' urgent need for culture, then you will forget everything! But, you should also understand that now I am so happy to see that the soldiers I teach can write articles smoothly!"
    Yes, after the new writing method was widely implemented in the army, Zeng Duanyi constantly received letters from comrades from various units, thanking her and hoping that she would continue to work hard to solve the difficulties in the cultural learning of the troops. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of her comrades, she worked even harder. In her diary, she wrote these few words: "I have nothing to be proud of. I only have the determination to train myself into a person who is more useful to the soldiers in the revolutionary furnace!"

    四十个夜晚
    ——访问新写字法创造者之一的曾端仪
    吴明
    在华南军区第三届文化教学代表大会上，我访问了一位优秀的部队女教师曾端仪同志。她是个青年团员，今年“五四”被评为一等青年模范教员。她和另外一个文化教员唐斌同志与文化教育干事周斌同志，摸索创造出一种较有系统的新写字法，这种新写字法受到了部队广大指战员的欢迎，目前已在全军中推广实行。华南军区给她（们）的嘉奖令中，指出这个方法“……给部队缩短了练习写字的时间，对集中精力开展写作，有很大作用。这种革命英雄主义与创造精神，值得表扬。并号召全军向他们学习……。”
    曾端仪同志是一个不满二十岁的青年，从像貌上看去，比她的年龄还更年青些。她充满了青春的活力，对战士有高度的热爱，对工作具有忘我的精神。初次见她的人都会感到惊奇，为什么像她这样
    一个文化并不算太高（初中毕业，又上了一年的农业学校）、年龄不大、教学经验不多的人，会有这样重大的创造呢？
    她笑着告诉我：
    “的确，从我个人方面来说，是没有什么更多的值得告诉人的地方。我是去年初才到部队，一到部队我就被战士们淳朴的热情所感动。战士们不仅在生活上帮助我，更时刻以他们高度的阶级觉悟来启示我。一年多以来，我的确进步了不少，在工作中我已数次立功，但这主要应归功于党对我的培养，部队给我的锻炼，我只不过初步做到了我应该做的事情。至于这个新写字法的摸索和创造经过情形是这样的：部队用速成识字法展开文化学习以后，战士们很快地获得了阅读能力，他们大量地阅读各种书报，那么勤苦认真，真像‘吃书’一样。但我每次到班里去，战士们仍要我替他们写信、写总结。我说你们不是已学会了很多的字吗？自己练习写吧！他们看看自己的手就摇摇头，战士周世家同志说：只学会了认字，没有学会写，仍像一个只能听别人讲话而自己不会讲话的哑巴一样。”
    周世家同志的话，使我们这个部队女教师大为感动了。她问战士们写字的困难在那里，战士们说：“不知道怎么写，那么多的字，又不像速成识字一样有个‘拐棍’，谁知道该先写那个？”曾端仪看战士们写字的时候，个个满头大汗，手打哆嗦，那么用劲地执着笔，她说：“我真暗暗地担心战士会把钢笔给撮断呢！”她心里很替他们着急，于是，她就把着李耀东的手来教，李耀东茁壮的手比她的手要粗大一倍，抓也抓不住，两个人都弄得满身大汗，还是写不好。她说：“这样也不是个办法！可是你说战士的手脚太笨了吗？那才不呢！看他们拨弄自己的武器时，多么灵巧！应该教会战士们写字像拨弄自己的武器一样。”
    她想到新华书店找一些关于写字的书，来研究解决，可是她失望了。她又想到了自己小时候学写字的情形，描红、写仿帖……，怎么能拿这来教战士？但写字的一般规律像从上到下，先左后右，横平竖直等不可以把它给简化了，变成合乎工农兵实用的写字法吗？别人常给她说：“写字没有秘诀，靠多写多练！”她说：“对是对，但我们更要速成……，”于是她开始思索解决这个问题的办法。她首先研究了祁建华速成识字法的基本特点之一是：分散难点、从易到难。写字也应该这样！她又仔细地观察战士们练写的情形：看一笔写一笔，不记字形，最容易添笔、缺笔、写错，并且写一会就扭的脖子痛，小手指贴着纸，不灵活；拿笔用力太大，容易累；不了解组成字的笔划，写起来很慢，不会下笔，写的大小不一……。她又想到战士们做操场动作，都是先从基本动作做起，写字也该从基本笔划写起。
    “我一定要帮战士解决写字的困难！”曾端仪下了决心。她吃饭在想，走路也在想。她很想把自己想出的办法拿来试验一下，但又怕打乱了整个的学习，她只好在夜晚十一时以后把自己想的写出来。四天以后，材料写好了，她拿着这份新写字法的草稿，送到团教育股去审看。但她走到教育股的门口，又退了回来，她想：“要是教育股的同志说：看你自己还写不好字，还想创造什么写字法，那怎么办？………不！不会的，他们一定帮助我。”果然教育股长非常高兴地听了她的报告，给了她几句鼓励的话。她倒真不大好意思起来！股长又告诉她七连文化教员唐斌同志也在研究这个问题，于是两个人就合在一块研究了，时间仍是利用夜晚。先分析了中国字一共只“八大零件”，再简结笔顺的几个要领，又选出了七十多种字旁、字头、字框、字底，初步规划了写字的方法，就分别找了两个没有写过字的小组来试验，经过了四个小时新旧办法的分别教学，没有用他们这个办法的一组，一小时只能写九十个字，用这个方法的一组，二十分钟可以写一百字，最快的九分钟便可写一百字。
    初步试验的成功，更坚定了曾端仪的信念。她为了能使战士根据字旁更好地体会字义、区别同音字、同形字，她动手整理单字本，一连开了七个夜车，二千四百个单字，被整理好了。为了重点练习，她又找出了二百七十个不同的单字，就这样，新的写字法又经过该部文化教育干事周斌同志的整理，就创造出来了。
    从开始整理，到全部完成，她共用了四十个夜晚，每天睡觉都在深夜以后。白天她还担任两个班级的教学任务，那时正是突击识字进入了巩固阶段，全体教学员都紧张的喘不过气来。白天她和别人一样忙了一天，半夜后，她拖着疲倦的身体，开始了写字法的研究。一到下两点以后，就腰酸骨节痛，顶讨厌的是眼睛不听指挥了，有时写了半天也不知道写的啥，有时拿着笔就睡了，一下醒来，墨水弄污了纸。但她没有因为疲劳而中断自己的整理研究。狠劲地用手拍几下脑袋，再从新写起。真困的不行就用冷水擦一把脸，在眼皮上擦些万金油，再不然就在嘴里填上些纸。有几次她真困极了，她躺在床上暂时休息一下，但刚一闭眼，她就好像看见战士们在她身旁，吃力地拿着笔为写字发愁；她睁眼一看，摇曳的灯光，照耀着她床头上毛主席微笑的像片，她马上感到毛主席在看着她的工作，于是精神来了，她又拿起笔来。有几个夜晚，她觉着天不早了，休息一下吧，她还没有躺下去，外边起床号响了。她连忙收拾起自己写的东西，拿起了课本，走上课堂，开始了她一天的教学工作。
    “你问我这样日以继夜地工作，身体能吃得消吗？”曾端仪安详地说：“是的，我曾累病了，有一次正在上课时，我感到头发晕，眼发黑，浑身发抖，眼看要倒下去，两个战士上来抱住了我，他们说：看你的嘴都白了，好教员，你休息吧，我们保证学好！但我一抬头看见了墙上的标语：多学会一个字，就等于多消灭一个敌人！这是我亲手写的，我不能离开课堂，我告诉战士们：我不能站，我可以坐着教，要是叫我离开了你们去休息，那比什么都难受。病了三天，只吃了一碗稀饭，但课一堂也没缺。”
    “你问我是什么力量在支持我吗？”曾端仪又笑了：“你为什么不去问那些朝鲜战场上艰苦奋斗的人们是为什么？为什么不去问我们的战士那种勤学苦练的忘我精神是为什么呢？以身体挡住敌人枪眼的英雄王玉山，不也是带病参加战斗吗？郭俊卿不也曾晕倒在战场上吗？比起他们来，我累点有了点病又算什么呢？告诉你：你如果能深切体会到战士们迫切需要文化的心情，那你什么都会忘记的！可是，你也该了解到，我现在看到我教的战士们都能顺利地写文章，我心里又是多么高兴！”
    是的，新写字法在部队普遍推行起来以后，曾端仪不断地收到各部同志的来信，向她致谢，希望她继续努力，为部队文化学习解决困难。在同志们热情的鼓舞下，她更加努力。在她的日记中写下了这样的几句话：“我没有什么值得骄傲的地方，我只有决心在革命的熔炉里，把自己锻炼成一个对战士更有用的人！”
