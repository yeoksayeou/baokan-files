Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 11th: The policy of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," which engages in divisive activities and colludes with warmongers, has greatly damaged its influence on Japanese trade unions. This situation has been particularly evident at the recent annual meetings of major unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

    The annual meeting of the Japan Express Transportation Workers' Union rejected the proposal to join the Confederation by a vote of 95 to 23. The annual meeting of the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union unanimously rejected a similar proposal, and the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union rejected it by a vote of 99 to 3.

    The annual meetings of the Japan Teachers' Union and the General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions—both members of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"—proposed withdrawing from the Confederation, which only narrowly failed to pass.

    The Japan Coal Miners' Union—also a member of the Confederation—expressed opposition at a special meeting held in May to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan joining the Confederation. This issue will be discussed at the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's delegate assembly to be held on July 22.

    日本工会总评议会的许多产业工会
    反对参加反动工会国际组织
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社东京十一日讯：从事分裂活动的“国际自由工会联合会”所奉行的与战争贩子勾结的政策，已使它对日本工会的影响大受损害，这种情形在最近日本工会总评议会所属的各大工会的年会上表现得特别显著。
    日本通运运输公司工会的年会以九十五票对二十三票否决了加入该联合会的建议。日本电气产业工会的年会一致拒绝了一个同样的建议，合成化学产业工会以九十九票对三票否决了这个建议。
    日本教职员工会与私营铁路工会总联合会——它们都是“国际自由工会联合会”的会员——的年会提出了退出该联合会的建议，这种建议仅仅因为差很少数的票而未获通过。
    日本煤矿工会——也是该联合会会员——在五月举行的特别会议上表示反对日本工会总评议会参加该联合会。这个问题将在七月二十二日所举行的日本工会总评议会的代表大会上讨论。
