    Shanxi Party Organizations at All Levels Widely Promote the "Patriotic Day" System
    The "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day" (hereinafter referred to as "Patriotic Day") system created by the masses of Weishe Village, Pinging County, Shanxi Province, after being introduced at the Provincial Model Propagandists Conference at the end of last year, is now being widely promoted throughout the province.
    The "Patriotic Day" system of Weishe Village is a regular system for regularly checking and revising patriotic covenants. This system is implemented by the village's Communist Party branch leading all Party members, Youth League members, and the broad masses. Since the establishment of this system, all propaganda activities of the Party's propagandists have revolved around "Patriotic Day."
    On "Patriotic Day," which is the evening of the first and fifteenth of each month (lunar calendar), the meeting place for "Patriotic Day" is decorated as if it were a festival. The village's cultural and entertainment team beats gongs and drums, and village cadres, activists, and the broad masses habitually enter the venue. After a period of cultural and entertainment activities, the meeting formally begins. At the meeting, the Party branch secretary or village head (branch committee member) briefly talks about current events and the village's work situation, pointing out the areas to pay attention to in this check of the patriotic covenant and the main tasks for the second half of the month. Then, the patriotic covenants are checked and revised by residential group, with good deeds praised and bad deeds criticized. After individual and group checks, a centralized check of the entire village's patriotic covenant is conducted. Because the branch has a prior understanding of the masses' thoughts and demands, and the masses are accustomed to this method of activity, the meeting can be concluded in just two or three hours.
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the "Patriotic Day" system, in which the people of Weishe Village regularly and collectively check their patriotic covenants, is a very good political education system and work inspection system. This system plays a significant role in raising the masses' awareness and promoting work. Furthermore, given that 70 percent of the masses in Shanxi Province have signed patriotic covenants, but nearly half of them are formalistic due to a lack of regular mass education and inspection systems, the Provincial Committee has called on Party branches throughout the province to universally promote the "Patriotic Day" system in order to overcome the formalistic tendencies of the patriotic covenants. Party branches throughout the province have responded to the call of the Provincial Committee, and by the end of April this year, according to incomplete statistics, nearly one thousand rural Party branches in fifty-one counties have led the masses to establish this system. The Provincial Committee requires that by October 1st, all areas with Party branches must establish the "Patriotic Day" system.
    Facts have proven that in places where the "Patriotic Day" system has been established, the activity base of the Party's propaganda network has been further consolidated, the Party's political and ideological leadership over the peasant masses has been greatly strengthened, the people's political life has become richer, the people's production enthusiasm has become higher, and the patriotic covenant has truly become the driving force of various tasks. In the past, 80 percent of the patriotic covenants in Shunjiahe Village, Qi County, were formalistic. In Wangjiazhai Village, Qinyuan County, most of the patriotic covenants were "written on paper, posted on the wall, and spoken from the mouth" but not truly implemented. Now, these formalistic tendencies have been basically overcome. Many places have effectively promoted the rural patriotic production movement through "Patriotic Day" gatherings. Many places have launched criticism and self-criticism within the masses through "Patriotic Day" activities. For example, when Xu Village, Tunliu County, launched a patriotic sanitation campaign, peasant Yang Baosheng said, "My lack of hygiene is none of anyone else's business." When the village health committee wanted to inspect the sanitation conditions in his home, he locked the door and refused to let them in. Later, at the "Patriotic Day" assembly, everyone criticized Yang Baosheng's erroneous thinking and actions that violated the interests of the collective, and Yang Baosheng also admitted his mistake. From this criticism and self-criticism, the peasants in the whole village further realized that individual interests should be subordinate to the overall interests. Now, the masses in various places love the "Patriotic Day" system very much. Some peasants say, "I do things based on 'Patriotic Day.' After 'Patriotic Day,' I know what I should do." Many people believe that with the "Patriotic Day" system, fewer meetings are held, less work is missed, and more things are done.
    Party organizations in various parts of Shanxi have gained the following preliminary experiences in promoting the "Patriotic Day" system:
    First, it is necessary to conduct thorough ideological mobilization among the people beforehand. When promoting the "Patriotic Day" system, Party organizations in various parts of Shanxi Province first used various methods to introduce the "Patriotic Day" system of Weishe Village, Pinging County, to the masses inside and outside the Party, and then organized the masses to study relevant articles on promoting the "Patriotic Day" system (such as the commentary "Promote the Experience of 'Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day' in Weishe Village, Pinging County" in the 52nd issue of the Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue and relevant editorials in the Shanxi Daily), and organized the masses to deliberate and discuss; any problems discovered were immediately resolved, so that the people consciously and willingly accepted and promoted this system. When promoting the "Patriotic Day" system in Dongbeiyang and Ande villages in Xiangyuan County, some of the masses suspected that the establishment of the "Patriotic Day" system would add another layer of "trouble," saying, "More meetings and 'Patriotic Days,' won't that waste even more work time?" The Party branch explained and criticized these incorrect understandings, and repeatedly publicized the benefits of the "Patriotic Day" system. Facts have proved that as long as the masses' understanding is generally improved, the implementation of the "Patriotic Day" system will be easier.
    Second, the method of promoting the "Patriotic Day" system should be from point to area. Xiangyuan, Pingshun, Licheng, and other counties all first selected villages with a better foundation for the Party's propaganda network to conduct experiments. During the experiment, village cadres and propagandist representatives from nearby villages were organized to visit. In this way, the "Patriotic Day" system was quickly promoted. The "Patriotic Day" system in 93 villages, including Hekou Village in Xiangyuan County, was established after visiting the "Patriotic Day" activities in the experimental village of Jialing. After the Pinging County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized all county, district, and village cadres to collectively visit the "Patriotic Day" activities in Weishe Village, it also organized everyone to discuss them, which also had a great effect.
    Third, Party organizations must attach great importance to leading this work. In the 1952 plan for consolidating and developing the propaganda network work, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that Party branches throughout the province should universally promote this system. Many propaganda officer meetings, branch secretary meetings, or three-level (county, district, and village) Party member and cadre meetings convened by many prefectural and county committees mobilized and deployed the promotion of the "Patriotic Day" system. In order to rapidly and universally promote this system, the Yucheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China successively issued instructions to its subordinate Party committees at all levels. The Linfen County Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated a plan for promoting the "Patriotic Day" system at the county's propaganda officer representative meeting, and promptly summarized and disseminated the typical experience of promoting the "Patriotic Day" system in the county. These activities of Party organizations at all levels, combined with the actions of the broad masses of the people, created the conditions for the smooth promotion of the "Patriotic Day" system.
    There are still some shortcomings in the promotion of the "Patriotic Day" system in Shanxi Province. The main reason is that the leaders in some areas have not given enough attention to this work, so there is still a serious imbalance in the process of promoting this system: the old areas have promoted this system more universally, while the new areas have only begun to pay attention to it; rural areas have developed very rapidly, while cities and enterprises such as organs, factories, and mines have not yet started. This situation needs to be changed through future efforts.

### 山西各级党组织广泛推行“爱国日”制度

    山西各级党组织广泛推行“爱国日”制度
    山西省平定县维社村群众所创造的“抗美援朝爱国日”（以下简称
    “爱国日”）制度，经过去年年底全省党的模范宣传员代表会议的介绍，现正在全省各地广泛推行。
    维社村的“爱国日”制度，是定期检查和修订爱国公约的一种经常性的制度。这种制度是由该村共产党支部领导全体党员、青年团员以及广大群众来执行的。自从这种制度建立以后，党的宣传员的一切宣传活动，就都围绕着“爱国日”进行。
    在“爱国日”这天，即每月的初一、十五（旧历）的晚上，“爱国日”的集会场所布置得像过节的一样，村里的文化娱乐队打起锣鼓，村干部、活动分子和广大群众习惯地走进会场。经过一段时间的文化娱乐活动，正式开会。会上由党支部书记或村长（支部委员）简单地讲述一下时事和村里的工作情况，指出这次检查爱国公约要注意的地方和下半月的主要工作。接着就以居民组为单位，检查、修订爱国公约，好的表扬，坏的批评。个人和小组检查以后，再集中检查全村的爱国公约。因为支部事先掌握了群众的思想情况和要求，群众又习惯了这样的活动方法，所以这个会只要两三个钟头就可以结束。
    中共山西省委认为维社村人民群众经常地集体地检查爱国公约的“爱国日”制度，是一种很好的政治教育制度和工作检查制度。这种制度对于提高群众觉悟、推动工作都有很大的作用。又鉴于山西全省虽有百分之七十的群众订立了爱国公约，但因缺乏群众性的经常的教育和检查制度，有将近一半的爱国公约还是形式主义的，因此省委号召全省党的支部普遍推广“爱国日”制度，以克服爱国公约的形式主义偏向。全省的党支部纷纷响应省委的号召，到今年四月底，据不完全的统计，已有五十一个县近一千个党的农村支部领导群众建立了这种制度。省委要求到十月一日，凡是有党支部的地区都要把“爱国日”制度建立起来。
    事实证明，凡是建立了“爱国日”制度的地方，党的宣传网的活动阵地更加巩固，党对农民群众的政治领导和思想领导也大大加强了，人民群众的政治生活也有了更丰富的内容，人民群众的生产热情也更加高涨，爱国公约真正成为各种工作的动力。过去祁县顺家河村百分之八十的爱国公约是形式主义的；沁源王家寨村的爱国公约大部分是“写在纸上，贴在墙上，说在嘴上”，而没有真正执行。现在这些形式主义偏向都基本上克服了。许多地方经过“爱国日”集会，有力地推动了农村的爱国丰产运动。许多地方则通过“爱国日”的活动，在群众内部开展了批评和自我批评。例如屯留县许村在开展爱国卫生运动时，农民杨保生说什么“我不讲卫生，与别人不相干”。村卫生委员要去他家里检查卫生状况，他把门锁上，不让进去。后来在“爱国日”大会上，大家批评了杨保生违反整体利益的错误思想和作法，杨保生也承认了自己的错误。从这次批评和自我批评当中，全村农民进一步认识了个人利益应该服从整体利益。现在各地群众都很喜爱“爱国日”这种制度。有的农民说：“我就凭‘爱国日’办事哩。过了‘爱国日’，自己该作啥，都有底了。”许多人都认为有了“爱国日”制度，少开了会，少误了工，多办了事。
    山西各地党组织在推广“爱国日”制度当中，已经取得了下列的初步经验：
    第一，事先要在人民群众中进行充分的思想动员。山西省各地党组织在推广“爱国日”制度时，首先运用各种方式向党内党外群众介绍平定维社村的“爱国日”制度，然后组织群众学习推广“爱国日”制度的有关论文（如抗美援朝专刊五十二期时评“推广平定县维社村‘抗美援朝爱国日’的经验”和山西日报的有关社论等），并组织群众酝酿、讨论；发现问题，立即解决，使人民群众自觉自愿地接受和推广这种制度。襄垣东北阳、安德两村在推广“爱国日”制度时，部分群众曾怀疑“爱国日”制度的建立，会多一层“麻烦”，说：“又开会，又过‘爱国日’，那不是误工更多了么？”党支部就针对这些不正确的认识进行了解释和批评，并反复地宣传了“爱国日”制度的好处。事实证明，只要群众的认识普遍提高，“爱国日”制度的推行也就容易了。
    第二，推广“爱国日”制度的方法，应该是由点到面。襄垣、平顺、黎城等县，都是首先选择党的宣传网工作基础较好的村子进行实验。在实验过程中，组织附近村的村干部和宣传员代表前往参观。这样，“爱国日”的制度就很快地推广开来。襄垣县河口等九十三个村庄的“爱国日”制度，就是在参观了实验村冀家岭“爱国日”活动以后建立起来的。中共平定县委组织全县县、区、村干部集体参观了维社村的“爱国日”活动以后，又组织大家进行了讨论，也收到很大的效果。
    第三，党的组织必须十分重视对这一工作的领导。中共山西省委在一九五二年巩固和发展宣传网工作的计划中，强调指出要全省党支部普遍推行这种制度。许多地委、县委所召开的宣传员会议，支部书记会议，或全县三级（县、区、村）党员干部会议，都针对推行“爱国日”制度，进行了动员，并作了布置。中共榆次地委为迅速而普遍地推行这个制度，曾连续地向所属各级党委发出指示。中共临汾县委在全县宣传员代表会议上订出了推广“爱国日”制度的计划，并及时地总结和传播了本县推行“爱国日”的典型经验。各级党组织的这些活动，和广大人民群众的行动结合起来，就造成了顺利推行“爱国日”制度的条件。
    山西省在推广“爱国日”制度当中，还有些缺点。主要是某些地区的领导人对这个工作还没有给予足够的重视，因而在推广这个制度的过程中还存在着严重的不平衡现象：老区已比较普遍地推广了这种制度，而新区才开始注意；农村发展很迅速，城市以及机关、厂、矿等企业单位，现在还没有开始。这种情况，需要今后努力加以改变。
