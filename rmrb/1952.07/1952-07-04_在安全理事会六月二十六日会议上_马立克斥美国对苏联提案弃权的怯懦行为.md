Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 29th (TASS dispatch): At the Security Council meeting on June 26th, Soviet representative Malik stated:

    When discussing the issue of the Geneva Protocol, proposed by the Soviet delegation, the US representative adopted a clearly provocative attitude. First, at the initial meeting, he formally proposed referring the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

    Representatives of the US-British bloc almost all stated their support for the US suggestion to refer the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. However, the US representative withdrew his own suggestion at the last minute, placing these representatives in a ridiculous and laughable predicament in the face of world opinion and their own people. They are now unable to explain their attitude. The British representative attempted to distance himself from his American partner. He stated that, after the Soviet representative’s speech yesterday, the British representative believed that referring the Soviet proposal to the Disarmament Commission would be of no benefit. In doing so, he only reinforced the reasons put forward by the Soviet delegation. He dared not vote against the Soviet proposal, and abstained. The discussion in the Security Council demonstrated that the US representative was the only one on the Security Council who showed contempt for the Geneva Protocol, but even he did not decide to vote against the Soviet proposal, but cowardly abstained.

    All of this is the best proof that the Soviet proposal aims to strengthen the cause of peace, and that the Geneva Protocol is an important international document, which the people of the world consider an important weapon that has prevented, is preventing, and will continue to prevent today's aggressors from using prohibited bacteriological and chemical weapons. Hitler – even Hitler, who had degenerated into a bloodthirsty beast, had to consider this protocol and the anger and dissatisfaction of the people around the world.

    Since Hitler's time, the world has fundamentally changed, but this change is not favorable to the aggressors, including the American aggressors. Today’s American aggressors must consider world opinion. Therefore, after expressing contempt for the Geneva Protocol, they did not dare to vote against the Soviet proposal in the Security Council, but cowardly abstained. This demonstrates the power of the Geneva Protocol, and demonstrates the changes that have taken place in the world: aggression is unwelcome, and aggressors dare not raise their hands against proposals aimed at strengthening international peace and security. They cowardly abstain in order to defeat such proposals.

    The US representative mentioned the Kellogg-Briand Pact, saying that this pact was unable to prevent Hitler from launching the Second World War. However, he did not mention the great and noble efforts to strive for peace. He did not mention the historical event where the Kellogg-Briand Pact united the people of the world into a united front, which finally defeated Hitler and sent Hitler and his gang of aggressors to the gallows. Some people argue that all old treaties, if they are in the interests of consolidating the cause of peace, are useful and effective, and must be fulfilled. The US representative’s proposal of the Kellogg-Briand Pact now proves the correctness of this argument.

    At today’s meeting of the Security Council, Mr. Gross formally said that the policy of the US government is "peace through strength." This is Hitler’s slogan, the slogan of fascist aggressors. Hitler dreamed of establishing a thousand-year reign of German fascism after enslaving the world. Hitler dreamed of building a world of might. The American ruling clique is following in his footsteps. This is a dangerous path. The people of the world will not take this path.

    From the day of the birth of the Soviet Union, from the day this new Soviet state was established on the ruins of the Tsarist regime, the first call of the new, young Soviet republic and the Soviet people after overthrowing the Tsarist system was "peace." From then until today, the Soviet Union and its government, like its people, have consistently strived for the noble struggle for peace.

    The great world peace movement has penetrated all levels of society. Hundreds of millions of conscientious people have signed the Stockholm Appeal. Regardless of their political views, regardless of their race, regardless of their color, regardless of their occupation and way of life, regardless of their wealth or poverty, they have enthusiastically signed their names to this declaration to strengthen peace. No matter how others try to undermine the prestige of this great peace movement, they will never succeed. This is a movement of millions upon millions of people, encompassing all levels of society, who faithfully strive for peace and faithfully strive to stop aggression.

    According to newspaper reports, just yesterday, several thousand New York women went to the United Nations seeking an audience, believing in their hearts that the United Nations was a "temple of peace." But how did the American officials in the United Nations treat these women? They did not allow the women to enter the United Nations building, and they refused to meet with their delegation. The women held a meeting in front of the United Nations building and sent their representatives to meet with the delegations of various countries to the United Nations.

    This is the result of the American policy, which is turning the United Nations into a tool of aggression and war, instead of a "temple of peace."

    I would also like to draw everyone's attention to the speech by the Brazilian representative. He said that every action to consolidate peace "is for the purpose of Soviet propaganda." This is not consistent with the facts. Every action to consolidate peace is in the interests of international peace and security. If the Brazilian representative believes that this is in the interests of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, I can only express my satisfaction, because that is exactly the case. However, I would also like to point out that this is not only in the interests of the Soviet people, but also in the interests of the Brazilian people, because it is in the interests of all people in the world who are striving for peace. This only violates the interests of those who pursue a policy of strength, and who exactly are these people who advocate a policy of strength? You all can know from listening to the US representative's speech at today's meeting of the Security Council. The US representative has formally admitted that the US government's policy is a policy of strength.

### 在安全理事会六月二十六日会议上  马立克斥美国对苏联提案弃权的怯懦行为

    在安全理事会六月二十六日会议上
    马立克斥美国对苏联提案弃权的怯懦行为
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日电：在安全理事会六月二十六日的会议上，苏联代表马立克发言说：
    在讨论苏联代表团所提出的关于日内瓦议定书的问题的时候，美国代表采取了显然的挑衅态度。首先，在第一次会议上，他就正式提出建议，要求把苏联的提案交给联合国裁减军备委员会。
    美英集团的代表们几乎全都说他们支持美国这个要求把苏联提案交给联合国裁减军备委员会的建议。但是美国代表却在最后一分钟撤回了自己的建议，致使这些代表们在世界舆论面前，在他们本国的人民面前，陷于荒谬可笑的窘境。他们现在不能够解释他们的态度了。英国代表试图摆脱他的美国伙伴。他说，在苏联代表昨天发言之后，英国代表认为把苏联提案交给裁减军备委员会是没有什么好处的。这样，他就只是加强了苏联代表团所提出的理由。他不敢投票反对苏联的提案，而弃了权。安全理事会中的讨论表明，美国代表是安理会中唯一表示看不起日内瓦议定书的人，可是甚至他也没有决定投票反对苏联提案，而是怯懦地弃了权。
    所有这些都是最好的证明，表明苏联的提案目的是加强和平事业，表明日内瓦议定书是重要的国际文件，全世界人民认为这文件是一个重要的武器，它阻挡了、阻挡着并将继续阻挡今天的侵略者使用禁止使用的细菌武器和化学武器。希特勒——甚至堕落成为嗜血的野兽的希特勒也不得不考虑这个议定书以及全世界人民的愤怒和不满。
    从希特勒那个时候起，世界已经有了根本的变化，但是这变化并不是对侵略者有利的，包括美国侵略者在内。今天的美国侵略者必须考虑世界舆论，因此，他们在表示了看不起日内瓦议定书以后，并不敢在安理会中投票反对苏联提案，而是怯懦地弃了权。这就表明了日内瓦议定书的力量，表明了世界上发生了的变化：侵略是不受欢迎的，侵略者不敢举起手来反对旨在加强国际和平和安全的提案。他们怯懦地弃了权，以便来击败这样的提案。
    美国代表提到基洛格公约说，这个公约并没有能够阻止希特勒发动第二次世界大战。但是，他却没有提到伟大崇高的争取和平的努力，基洛格公约使全世界人民结成了一个联合阵线，最后打垮了希特勒，把希特勒一伙侵略者送上了绞刑台，这样一个历史事件他也没有提到。有人主张，一切旧有的条约，如果合乎巩固和平事业的利益，就都是有用而且有效的，而且必须加以履行，现在美国代表提出这个基洛格公约，就恰恰证明了这种主张的正确。
    在安全理事会今天的会议上，葛罗斯先生正式说，美国政府的政策是“以实力为后盾的和平”。这是希特勒的口号，是法西斯侵略者的口号。希特勒梦想在奴役全世界之后，建立德国法西斯主义万年的统治。希特勒梦想建立一个强权的世界。美国统治集团步着他的后尘。这是一条危险的道路。世界各国人民不会走这条路。
    从苏联诞生的一天起，从这个新的苏维埃国家在沙皇政权的废墟上建立起来的一天起，新的年青的苏维埃共和国和苏联人民在推翻沙皇制度之后的第一个呼声就是“和平”，从那时一直到今天，苏联及其政府也像它的人民一样，一贯努力进行争取和平的崇高斗争。
    伟大的世界和平运动深入到一切阶层，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的已有数亿有正义感的人民，他们不分政治见解，不分种族，不分肤色，不分职业和生活方式，不分贫富，都热烈地在这个加强和平的宣言上签上了他们的名字，别人无论怎样企图破坏这个伟大的和平运动的威信，都是决不能成功的。这是一个遍及一切阶层的千千万万人民的运动，他们都忠实地努力谋求和平，忠实地努力制止侵略。
    根据报纸消息，就在昨天，好几千名纽约妇女到联合国求见，她们心里以为联合国是“和平的殿堂”。但是，联合国里的美国官员是怎样对待这些妇女的呢？他们不许妇女们进入联合国大厦，他们拒绝接见她们的代表团。妇女们在联合国大厦前举行会议，派出她们的代表去会见各国驻联合国代表团。
    这便是美国的政策的结果，它正在把联合国变成侵略和战争的工具，而不是变成“和平的殿堂”。
    我也要提醒大家注意巴西代表的发言。他说，每一个为了巩固和平的行动，“都是为了苏联的宣传目的”。这是和事实不符的。每一个为了巩固和平的行动，都合乎国际和平及安全的利益。如果巴西代表认为，这合乎苏联和苏联人民的利益，我就只能表示满意，因为事实正是这样的。但是，我还愿意指出，这并不单止符合苏联人民的利益，而且也符合巴西人民的利益，因为这符合全世界一切为争取和平而努力的人民的利益。这只违反那些奉行实力政策的人的利益，而这些主张实力政策的人到底是谁，你们大家听过美国代表在安全理事会今天会议上的发言，就可以知道了，美国代表已经正式承认美国政府的政策是以实力为后盾的政策。
