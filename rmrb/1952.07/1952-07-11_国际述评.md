　　Peace Can Be Saved, Peace Must Be Saved
　　The World Peace Council held a special session in Berlin from July 1st to 6th to discuss current measures to strengthen the defense of peace and achieved significant results.
　　American imperialism is frantically stepping up its war efforts in Asia and Europe. In addition to continuing its heinous crimes in Korea, the United States has not only illegally declared the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, but has also coerced Western European countries into signing two war treaties—the so-called "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty. The United States is using these war treaties it signed with Japan and West Germany to blatantly foster Japanese militarist forces; intensify the division of Germany, restore the Nazi army in West Germany, and use this army as the core to build a so-called "European Army." These heinous measures by American imperialism constitute a serious threat to world peace. The people of Japan and Germany, and all the people of Asia and Europe, are waging intense struggles against the war policies of the United States.
　　In view of this situation, the World Peace Council special session discussed and adopted the "Appeal to the Governments of the Four Great Powers and the People of the World on the German Question," the "Resolution on Opposing the Remilitarization of Japan and Struggling for a Democratic Japan," the "Resolution on the Issue of Stopping the Korean War," and the "Declaration on Convening the World People's Peace Congress," and approved the "Appeal to All Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" passed by the World Peace Council at the Oslo meeting. In these resolutions, the World Peace Council called on all peace-loving people of the world to: demand the signing of an armistice agreement in accordance with the principles of respecting international law and conventions, immediately end the Korean War, and require all countries to ratify and abide by the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons; demand the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty with Japan by all relevant countries. At the same time, it called on the people of Asia and the Pacific countries to do everything possible to mobilize for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing this autumn. The World Peace Council called on the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union to hold a meeting to pass all decisions to peacefully resolve the German issue; and called on the people of the world, especially the people of Western European countries, to unite all forces to prevent the ratification of separate agreements and strive for a Four Power conference to ensure the security of all countries and peacefully resolve the German issue. The special session declaration decided to hold the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5 this year to broadly unite the people of all countries to safeguard world peace.
　　The resolutions of the World Peace Council special session have defined clear goals and concrete tasks for the current people's movement to defend peace in various countries. The conference declaration also affirmed: "Peace can be saved! Peace must be saved!" This will play a major role in inspiring the struggle of people all over the world for peace. Therefore, these resolutions and declarations are bound to be warmly welcomed and supported by the people all over the world.
　　European People Persist in Struggle Against War and Fascist Rule
　　Events in Western Europe in the past month prove that American imperialism's war policies have met with increasingly fierce opposition from the people of Western European countries; the movement of Western European countries against military treaties and aggressive wars is constantly rising, and American imperialism's rule in Western Europe is becoming increasingly fragile.
　　French Communist Party Secretary Duclos was released on July 1. This event marks a major victory in the French people's struggle against war and fascist rule and for independence and democracy. A month ago, under the direction of its American masters, the reactionary French government carried out a frenzied suppression of the French people's protest movement against Ridgway's arrival in Paris, illegally arresting French Communist leader Duclos, Thorez, and other French patriots, in an attempt to strike a blow at the French people's protest movement. This frenzied crime by the reactionary French government aroused angry protests from the people of France and the world. Under the strong calls from the people of France and the world demanding the release of Duclos, American imperialism and the French reactionaries were extremely frightened. Therefore, they had to release Duclos. Their conspiracy against the French people suffered another shameful defeat.
　　The currently powerful anti-Ridgway movement is spreading in Western European countries. Wherever this plague general goes, the people there rise up in protest. Another American warmonger, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, also received the same treatment from the people of Western European countries when he "visited" London, Berlin, and Vienna at the end of June. The European people know that Ridgway and Acheson are symbols of American war policies, so Ridgway and Acheson are bound to be "hunted down by everyone" in Western Europe.
　　The German people and the European people have further launched a resolute struggle against the alliance between American and British imperialism and West German militarism, against dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and for German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty. The people of West Germany continue to hold protest strikes and mass rallies. On June 10 alone, 200,000 workers in West Germany went on strike to oppose the so-called factory law that restricts workers' rights under the "General Treaty." Currently, the people of West Germany are launching a movement to demand a plebiscite throughout West Germany, demanding the rejection of the "General Treaty" and the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This movement has become the central goal of the West German people's current struggle. The German people's struggle for national unification and peace has received the enthusiastic support of the people of European countries. The governments and people of European people's democracies—Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland—have issued statements opposing the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty" and supporting the German people's struggle.
　　The International Conference for the Solution of the German Question, attended by representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, was held in Odense, Denmark, from June 14 to 15. At this meeting, representatives from various countries adopted resolutions and declarations opposing the rearmament of West Germany and the "General Treaty," advocating a peaceful resolution of the German issue, and guaranteeing to do their best to prevent their governments from ratifying the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty," and to strive for a Four Power conference to discuss the German issue. The enthusiastic support of the European people has given great encouragement to the German people's struggle.
　　This fierce struggle of the European people is a heavy blow to American imperialism's war policies and the fascist rule of the reactionary factions in Western European countries.
　　The Soviet Union Has Made Major Efforts to Ban Bacteriological Weapons
　　As the people of the world are intensifying their struggle to stop germ warfare and ban the use of bacteriological weapons, Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik proposed at the Security Council meeting on June 18 a proposal to call on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons. This is another new effort by the Soviet Union to safeguard the cause of world peace.
　　As everyone knows, the 1925 Geneva Protocol, signed and joined by forty-eight countries, has been ratified by forty-two of them, with only six countries, including the United States, failing to ratify it. The United States has shelved this protocol for more than twenty years without ratifying it, and in 1947, U.S. President Truman even used the excuse that the protocol was "outdated" and asked the U.S. Senate not to ratify it.
　　The Soviet proposal gave a serious blow to the American aggressors who opposed the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, and it has made the United States panic-stricken in the Security Council. U.S. representative Gross initially tried his best to hand over the proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which had rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the use of bacteriological weapons, in order to evade discussion of the issue. Then, at the Security Council meeting on June 26, the United States manipulated the majority to veto the Soviet proposal. After the Soviet proposal was vetoed, Gross immediately withdrew his proposal to refer the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for discussion. This cowardly behavior of the United States fully exposed its fear of banning the use of bacteriological weapons and its ambition to continue preparing to use this evil weapon.
　　At the same time, the American aggressors also put forward a proposal in the Security Council for the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an "investigation" into the accusations of bacteriological warfare by North Korea and China against the United States. At the Security Council meeting on June 23, Soviet representative Malik agreed to include the American proposal on the agenda, but the Security Council must invite representatives from the countries related to the issue raised by the United States, namely the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, to participate in the discussion, and these two actions must be taken simultaneously. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Security Council meeting on June 25 only adopted the American so-called "investigation" proposal, and the July 1 meeting vetoed the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from North Korea and China to participate in the discussion. The United States, while advocating for an "investigation" into the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea, is afraid of the representatives of North Korea and China exposing its heinous crimes of launching bacteriological warfare against the people of North Korea and China in the Security Council. From this, one can see how embarrassed the American bacteriological criminals, who are facing the sanctions of human justice, are in.
　　The United States' ploy of using the International Committee of the Red Cross to "investigate" the accusations of North Korea and China against the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare is completely a shameless trick to collect intelligence on the effects of bacteriological warfare. The Soviet representative has solemnly rejected the American proposal to "investigate" the accusations of using bacteriological weapons at the Security Council meeting on July 3. This righteous action by the Soviet Union has prevented the United States' conspiracy from succeeding.
　　The just struggle waged by Soviet representative Malik in the United Nations Security Council has further exposed the ugly face of the American aggressors, which is of great significance to the great struggle of all righteous humanity against germ warfare.

专栏：国际述评

    国际述评
    和平可以拯救，和平必须拯救
    世界和平理事会于七月一日至六日在柏林召开了特别会议，讨论了当前加强保卫和平的各项措施，并获得了重大的成就。
    美帝国主义正在亚洲和欧洲疯狂地加紧战争步骤。美国除了在朝鲜继续其滔天罪行以外，它不但非法宣布了单独对日和约与美日安全条约的生效，而且压迫西欧国家签订了两个战争条约——所谓“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约。美国正利用它和日本及西德所签订的这些战争条约，明目张胆地扶植日本军国主义势力；加紧分裂德国，恢复西德的纳粹军队，并以这支军队为核心，筹建所谓“欧洲军”。美帝国主义这些罪恶措施构成了对全世界和平的严重威胁。日本和德国人民，全亚洲和全欧洲人民为反对美国的战争政策正进行着紧张的斗争。
    鉴于这种情势，世界和平理事会特别会议讨论并通过了“关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书”、“关于反对日本重新军国主义化、为民主的日本而斗争的决议”、“关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议”和“关于召开世界人民和平大会的宣言”，并批准了世界和平理事会奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书。在这些决议中，世界和平理事会号召全世界爱好和平的人民：要求在尊重国际公法和惯例的原则下签订停战协定，立即结束朝鲜战争，并要求一切国家都批准并遵守一九二五年禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书；要求另订一个由所有有关国家签订的真正的对日和约。同时号召亚洲及太平洋各国人民竭尽一切力量为今年秋天在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而动员起来。世界和平理事会呼吁美国、法国、英国和苏联四大国召开会议，以通过和平解决德国问题的一切决定；并号召全世界人民，特别是西欧各国人民团结一切力量，阻止批准单独协定，争取召开四大国会议，以保障各国的安全，和平解决德国问题。特别会议宣言中决定于今年十二月五日在维也纳举行世界人民和平大会，以便广泛团结各国人民，来保障世界和平。
    世界和平理事会特别会议的各项决议，给当前各国人民保卫和平运动规定了明确的目标和具体的任务。会议宣言并肯定指出：“和平可以拯救！和平必须拯救！”这对鼓舞全世界人民争取和平的斗争将起着重大的作用。因此，这些决议和宣言必然为全世界人民所热烈欢迎和拥护。
    欧洲人民为反对战争、反对法西斯统治而坚持斗争
    最近一个月来在西欧发生的事件证明：美帝国主义的战争政策已遭到西欧各国人民愈来愈猛烈的反对；西欧各国人民反对军事性条约，反对侵略战争的运动正在不断地高涨，美帝国主义在西欧的统治愈来愈脆弱了。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛已于七月一日恢复自由。这件事标志着法国人民反对战争和法西斯统治、争取独立和民主的斗争的重大胜利。一个月以前，法国反动政府在其美国主子的指使下，对法国人民反对李奇微到达巴黎的抗议运动进行了疯狂的镇压，非法逮捕了法共领袖杜克洛、斯梯和其他法国爱国人士，妄图借此打击法国人民的抗议运动。法国反动政府的这一疯狂罪行引起了全法国和全世界人民的愤怒抗议。在全法国和全世界人民要求释放杜克洛的强大呼声之下，美帝国主义和法国反动派感到万分恐惧。因此，他们不得不释放杜克洛。他们反对法国人民的阴谋又一次遭到了可耻的失败。
    目前声势浩大的抗议李奇微运动正在西欧各国扩展着。这位瘟疫将军走到那里，那里的人民就起来抗议。而另一个美国战争贩子、美国国务卿艾奇逊于六月底在伦敦、柏林和维也纳进行“访问”时，也遭到了西欧各国人民的同样的接待。欧洲人民知道：李奇微和艾奇逊都是美国战争政策的象征，因此，李奇微和艾奇逊在西欧就必然要遭到“人人喊打”的命运。
    德国人民和欧洲人民进一步展开坚决的斗争，反对美英帝国主义与西德军国主义的同盟，反对把西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团，争取德国统一与缔结和约。西德人民继续举行抗议性的罢工和群众大会。仅在六月十日一天中，西德就有二十万工人罢工，反对根据“一般性条约”限制工人权利的所谓工厂法。目前，西德人民正在展开要求在西德全境举行公民复决的运动，要求否决“一般性条约”，并迅速缔结对德和约。这一运动已成为西德人民目前斗争的中心目标。德国人民争取祖国统一与和平的斗争，获得欧洲各国人民的热烈支持。欧洲人民民主国家——罗马尼亚、保加利亚和波兰等国的政府和人民纷纷发表声明，反对“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团条约”，支持德国人民的斗争。
    由英国、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、瑞典、丹麦和挪威等国代表出席的国际争取解决德国问题会议，已于六月十四日至十五日在丹麦鄂丹斯举行。各国代表在这个会议上通过了反对重新武装西德与“一般性条约”，主张和平解决德国问题的决议和宣言，保证尽力阻止本国政府批准
    “一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团条约”，并争取举行讨论德国问题的四大国会议。欧洲人民的热烈支持，给予德国人民的斗争以极大的鼓舞。
    欧洲人民的这一激烈的斗争，对于美帝国主义的战争政策和西欧各国反动派的法西斯统治都是一个沉重的打击。
    苏联为禁用细菌武器进行了重大努力
    当世界人民正为制止细菌战和禁止使用细菌武器而加紧斗争的时候，苏联驻联合国代表马立克在六月十八日举行的安全理事会会议上，提出关于号召各国参加并批准一九二五年签订的禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的建议。这是苏联对保卫世界和平事业的又一次新的努力。
    大家知道：由四十八个国家签订和参加的一九二五年日内瓦议定书，已经获得其中的四十二个国家的批准，没有批准的只有美国等六个国家。美国把这个议定书搁置了二十几年没有批准，一九四七年美国总统杜鲁门并藉口这个议定书已经“过时”而要美国参议院不予批准。
    苏联的建议给予反对禁止使用细菌武器的美国侵略者以一个严重的打击，它已使美国在安全理事会上惊惶失措。美国代表葛罗斯起先极力主张把这个建议交给曾经拒绝了苏联要求禁止使用细菌武器的建议的联合国裁减军备委员会去处理，来规避对这个问题的讨论。接着美国又于安全理事会六月二十
    六日会议上操纵多数否决了苏联的建议。而在苏联
    的建议被否决后，葛罗斯立即撤销了他把苏联的建
    议交到联合国裁减军备委员会去讨论的建议。美国这种卑怯的行为，充分暴露了它对于禁止使用细菌武器一事的恐惧及其继续准备使用这种罪恶武器的野心。
    与此同时，美国侵略者在安全理事会上又提出了由红十字国际委员会对朝中两国对美国进行细菌战的指责进行“调查”的建议。在安全理事会六月二十三日会议上，苏联代表马立克赞成把美国的建议列入议程，但是安全理事会必须邀请与美国所提问题有关的国家，即朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论，这两个行动必须同时采取。然而在美国的操纵下，安全理事会六月二十五日的会议仅仅通过了美国的所谓“调查”的建议，七月一日会议又否决了苏联所提关于邀请朝中两国代表参加讨论的建议。美国既主张对于在朝鲜使用细菌武器一事进行“调查”，又害怕朝中两国代表在安全理事会上揭发它对朝中人民发动细菌战的滔天罪行。人们由此可以看到：面临人类正义制裁的美国细菌罪犯们所处的地位是如何的狼狈了。
    美国玩弄由红十字国际委员会“调查”朝中两国对美国进行细菌战谴责的阴谋，完全是企图借此搜集关于细菌战的效果的情报的无耻骗局，苏联代表在安全理事会七月三日的会议上已严正地否决了美国关于“调查”对使用细菌武器的谴责的提案。苏联的这一正义行动，已使美国的阴谋不能得逞。
    苏联代表马立克在联合国安全理事会所进行的正义斗争，进一步揭露了美国侵略者的丑恶面目，这对于全体正义人类反对细菌战的伟大斗争是具有重要意义的。
