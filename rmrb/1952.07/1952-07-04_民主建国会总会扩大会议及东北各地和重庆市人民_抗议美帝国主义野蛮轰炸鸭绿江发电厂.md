Xinhua News Agency Report: The All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction Associations enlarged meeting, as well as people from various parts of Northeast China and Chongqing, have vehemently condemned the savage bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant by U.S. imperialism. The entire body of representatives attending the Second Enlarged Meeting of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction Associations issued a telegram stating: The U.S. imperialists recently wantonly bombed the Yalu River hydroelectric power plant, which has no military installations, on the border of the Korean rear along the Yalu River, attempting to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people and obtain at the negotiating table what they cannot. This despicable and rogue attempt will only further arouse the fighting will of the Chinese and Korean people's forces and the determination of people worldwide to defend peace and resist aggression. We unanimously guarantee to mobilize members nationwide, call on industrialists and businessmen nationwide to strive for increased production and thrift, and continue to support the Chinese and Korean people's forces with renewed vigor, to inflict even more severe blows on the aggressors, in order to win the final victory in the war to defend world peace as soon as possible.

Li Desheng, an electrical worker in Fushun City who worked at the Yalu River Power Plant for more than seven years, said, "That is a large-scale peaceful facility. There are my partners of many years, they are all heroic Korean workers. I believe the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors will not scare them, and light and victory will always belong to the Korean people." Su Facheng, an electrical worker in Andong City, said, "Since the U.S. aggressors have carried out such a serious and unreasonable provocation, we must work harder to support the Korean and Chinese people's forces and severely strike the aggressors until they accept peace." Han Yongbin, a merchant, and Li Sijian, a student from Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, who witnessed U.S. planes dropping germ bombs in our country, also stated, "The American murderers who bombed the Yalu River Power Plant must be severely punished by the people of the world, just like the American germ warfare criminals." Xu Guochen, a train driver at Linjiang Station who was wounded in the left finger by a U.S. plane in 1950, angrily denounced this atrocity by the U.S. aggressors as "another public provocation against peace-loving people around the world." One hundred and twenty people, including famous labor models Ma Hengchang, Tian Guiying, Wang Zhaoda, and Liu Jinggui, who are studying at the Northeast Experimental School for Workers and Peasants, jointly issued a letter of protest against this atrocity by the U.S. Air Force. Members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, held a meeting to protest the bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant by U.S. planes.

The Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic League, the Chongqing Branch of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction Associations, and the Chongqing Branch of the Jiusan Society jointly or separately issued letters of protest, pointing out that this provocative act by the U.S. aggressors is undeniable evidence of deliberately expanding the war of aggression and threatening peace in Asia and the world, which cannot but arouse the deep concern of peace-loving people worldwide. The Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions called on all employees in the protest letter to strive to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, to fully support the Korean front and give the U.S. aggressors a greater blow. The majority of employees and residents in the city generally expressed anger after hearing the news that the U.S. Air Force invading Korea indiscriminately bombed peaceful facilities. In order to respond to the provocation of U.S. imperialism with practical actions, many residents have incorporated further strengthening support for the Korean front into patriotic covenants.

    民主建国会总会扩大会议及东北各地和重庆市人民
    抗议美帝国主义野蛮轰炸鸭绿江发电厂
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：民主建国会总会扩大会议以及东北各地和重庆市人民，纷纷痛斥美帝国主义野蛮轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的暴行。民主建国会第二次总会扩大会议全体代表发表通电称：美帝国主义者最近竟对朝鲜后方鸭绿江边境毫无军事设备的鸭绿江水力发电厂滥施轰炸，妄图恫吓中朝人民，以取得停战谈判席上所不能取得的东西，这种卑怯无赖的企图，只有更加激起中朝人民部队的战斗意志，和全世界人民保卫和平反抗侵略的决心。我们一致保证，动员全国会员，号召全国工商业者，努力增产节约，再接再厉地支援中朝人民部队，予侵略者以更严重的打击，以求早日争取保卫世界和平战争的最后胜利。
    抚顺市电业工人李德生曾在鸭绿江发电厂作工七年多，他说：“那是一座规模宏大的和平设备。那里有我相处多年的伙伴，他们都是英勇的朝鲜工人，我相信美国侵略者的暴行吓不倒他们，光明和胜利永远是属于朝鲜人民的。”安东市电业工人苏发成说：“美国侵略者既然进行了这样严重的无理挑衅，我们就要更加努力地支援朝中人民部队，狠狠地给侵略者以严重打击，直到它接受和平为止。”目击美国飞机在我国投掷细菌弹的辽东省宽甸县商人韩永斌、学生李思俭也表示：“轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的美国凶手一定要和美国的细菌战犯一样，将受到全世界人民的严厉惩办。”一九五零年曾被美国飞机炸伤左手指的临江车站火车司机徐国臣愤怒地斥责美国侵略者这一暴行是“向全世界和平人民再一次公开挑衅”。正在东北实验学校工农速成中学学习的著名劳动模范马恒昌、田桂英、王兆达、刘景贵等一百二十人对美国空军这一暴行联名发表抗议书。吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社的社员们，举行了抗议美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂暴行的集会。
    中国民主同盟重庆市支部、民主建国会重庆市分会、九三学社重庆分社联合或分别发表抗议书指出：美国侵略者这种挑衅行为，是蓄意扩大侵略战争，威胁亚洲和世界和平的无可抵赖的证据，全世界爱好和平的人民不能不引起深切的注意。重庆市总工会在抗议书中，号召全市职工努力开展增产节约运动，以全力支援朝鲜前线，予美国侵略者以更大的打击。全市广大职工、居民，听到侵朝美国空军滥炸和平设备的消息后，普遍表示愤怒。为了以实际行动回答美帝国主义的挑衅，许多居民都把进一步加强对朝鲜前线的支援，订入爱国公约内。
