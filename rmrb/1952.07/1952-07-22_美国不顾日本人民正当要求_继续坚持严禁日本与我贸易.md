    Xinhua News Agency, July 21st -- The United States government's policy of blockade and embargo has met with increasing opposition from people of all countries. Now, ignoring the just demands of the Japanese people, the United States government continues to insist on the unreasonable measure of strictly prohibiting Japan from trading with China.
    Under the pressure of the Japanese people's demands for the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, the Japanese government recently requested the United States to relax the strict restrictions on Japanese trade with China and allow the export of some civilian goods. According to a France-Presse report from Tokyo, the United States government has formally rejected Japan's request. This reply was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 16th by officials from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. In its reply, the United States government disingenuously said that it "cannot decide alone" on the issue of relaxing the ban on Japanese trade with China and must "consult" with other countries in order to adopt a "common policy" on trade with China.
    News from Tokyo and Washington confirms that the United States is preparing to hold a five-nation conference in Washington on July 28, with the participation of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Japan, to discuss "cooperation issues" in its China trade policy. United Press admitted that this kind of meeting is like the consultations that the United States and its Western European puppet states often hold when dealing with trade issues with the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries. The Japanese Foreign Ministry also announced this meeting in a statement issued on the 18th. The statement also indicated that the Japanese government had succumbed to pressure from the United States and continued to obey the U.S.'s "embargo" policy. The statement obsequiously said: "The Japanese government reiterates its willingness to take concerted action with other major exporting countries in controlling exports."
    Obviously, at the five-nation conference, the United States government will try its best to force its puppet states to continue to implement the war policy of "embargo" in Asia. This policy will endanger the freedom of trade in the Far East and the world, hinder the normal development of foreign trade in various countries, especially Japan, and the result will be to further increase the difficulties of those countries' industry and commerce, expand their number of unemployed, and lower their people's living standards, while facilitating the United States government's implementation of its policy of foreign trade of monopoly capitalism.

### 美国不顾日本人民正当要求  继续坚持严禁日本与我贸易

    美国不顾日本人民正当要求
    继续坚持严禁日本与我贸易
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国政府封锁禁运政策已经遭到各国人民愈来愈多的反对，现在美国政府不顾日本人民正当的要求，仍然继续坚持严禁日本与中国进行贸易的无理措施。
    在日本人民要求恢复中日贸易的压力下，日本政府最近曾要求美国放宽对日本与中国进行贸易的严格限制，准许一部分民用品出口。据法新社东京消息，美国政府已经正式拒绝了日本的要求，这个答复是由东京美国大使馆官员在十六日转送给日本外务省的。美国政府在答覆中推诿地说：对于放宽日本对中国贸易的禁令一事，“美国不能单独决定”，必须“谘询”其他国家，以便在与中国的贸易问题上采取一个“共同的政策”。
    来自东京和华盛顿的消息证实，美国准备七月二十八日在华盛顿举行有美国、英国、法国、加拿大、日本参加的五国会议，讨论对华贸易政策中的“合作问题”。合众社承认，这种会议就像美国和其西欧仆从国家之间在处理与苏联和东欧人民民主国家的贸易问题时时常举行的磋商一样。日本外务省在十八日发表的声明也宣布了这一会议。声明并表明日本政府已屈服在美国的压力之下，继续服从美国的“禁运”政策，声明奴颜婢膝地说：“日本政府重申愿意与其他主要输出国在管制出口方面采取联合一致的行动。”
    显然地，在五国会议上，美国政府将竭力强迫其仆从国家继续在亚洲执行“禁运”的战争政策。这个政策将危害远东及世界的贸易自由，妨碍各国特别是日本对外贸易的正常发展，其结果将是进一步增加那些国家工商业的困难，扩大其失业人数，降低其人民生活水准，而便利美国政府实施其垄断资本主义国家对外贸易的政策。
