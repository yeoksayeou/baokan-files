    How Should Party Organizations in Enterprises Work?
    ——Introducing the Work Experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant Party Organization
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Dingkun
    Not bowing to difficulties, and diligently learning in the face of new things – the Party organization of the Shijingshan Power Plant has strengthened itself by promoting these fine traditions of the Party.
    In September 1949, generator number × suffered serious damage. This was the first serious test encountered by the Party organization of the Shijingshan Power Plant. The masses’ reaction was: “Half the sky has fallen for us,” worried about losing their jobs if the machine could not be repaired. The engineers’ discussion was: “This cannot be solved with our technology; we need to replace the machine with a new one.” The Party organization adopted a different attitude, bravely undertaking the task of resolute repair, actively suggesting that the administration call on employees to strengthen the operation of the original engine, and specifically established a Party小组 (small group) focused on repairing generator number × to strengthen the Party's work during the repair period. This小组 (small group) carried out work in two aspects: on the one hand, it fought against those who deliberately emphasized difficulties and spread a mood of failure; on the other hand, it put all its strength into the repair work, not only using their hands, but also diligently studying problems, consulting with technicians and workers, and trying to support and encourage creative people, summarizing and applying their rich experience, and overcoming many difficulties. The Party organization also called on Party members to overcome all difficulties to complete this task, which was necessary to ensure the full power generation of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid. After four and a half months of day and night efforts, with the help of Soviet experts, generator number × was finally repaired and power generation was restored. This test educated the leading cadres of the Party organization – one must never go with the flow, but stubbornly advance against difficulties.
    In March 1950, when the Shijingshan Power Plant accepted the task of establishing a plant-wide overhaul system and carrying out a restorative overhaul, the Party organization's confidence in overcoming difficulties became even stronger. At the beginning, the mood of habitually bowing to difficulties still prevailed. Some people were saying: "What will be the result of repairing a power plant that has been around for three generations?" "You'll break the machine even if it's not broken!"... The Party leadership actively promoted the signing of a quality guarantee contract for boiler number × between the trade union and the administration, and selected the turbine workshop, which had a better Party foundation, to cultivate the Liu Dezhen model team, creating new records for no rework in repairs and eliminating leaks of water, oil, and gas. The Party organization summarized the experience of the Liu Dezhen team, put forward the slogan of "eliminating seven leaks" (leaks of steam, oil, water, coal, air, etc.), and suggested that the trade union and the administration promote this experience, directly ensuring the quality of the overhaul. The success of this overhaul taught the Party leadership another lesson – in the face of difficulties, one must be good at breaking through typical cases to promote the general.
    In September 1950, when the plant's leadership put forward the task of ensuring safe power supply, it encountered the same obstacles as before. Many people believed: "Accidents never happen at the power plant - a pig will fly first." But the Party leadership knew what to do, stood firm in its position, and on the one hand, assigned special personnel to conduct accident analysis, educated the workers, and explained that accidents could be prevented in advance, and launched a campaign to eliminate accidents throughout the plant; on the other hand, it went deep into the electrical workshop, where most accidents occurred, to study the situation. As a result of this movement, workers throughout the plant found 2,119 causes of accidents from all aspects, and the Party seized this matter to promote the trade union administration, launching a "eliminate 2119" campaign, which finally achieved a complete victory, creating a new record of 183 days without accidents. In this way, the Party organization learned many good experiences from overcoming difficulties. Since then, in many major technical reforms within the plant, such as reducing coal consumption in 1951, burning low-calorie coal (inferior coal) in the 1952 production increase and conservation movement, and implementing rapid overhauls, the Party organization has been able to resolutely organize forces and rely on the masses, thus ensuring the completion of tasks.
    The leaders of the Party general branch committee were cadres from the Anti-Japanese War period. They did not understand technology, but they had a firm belief: "Communists have no difficulties they cannot overcome." Wang Zhimian, the general branch secretary, said: "We haven't fought a war before, but after a few years of fighting, we will know how. Running a factory is not the same as fighting a war, but it is not impossible to learn." He also said: "Roads are walked day by day, and ideas are gradually clarified day by day. In the beginning, the leadership was completely passive about the two links in the power plant's work – safe power supply and cost reduction. When coal consumption was high, we proposed: 'No black smoke from above, no black coal from below'; when the transformer burned out, we found out the cause and proposed: 'Close the windows when it's windy and rainy,' but this could not solve the problem. When we learned to actively find difficulties and solve difficulties, our work became less difficult."
    At the recent general branch committee meeting, everyone reviewed the road they had taken in the past three years and unanimously felt that in every plant-wide reform movement, there would be two different opinions: one from a part of the people with conservative ideas, emphasizing difficulties and emphasizing equipment conditions; the other from workers' activists, who often thought from the perspective of national interests, from how to improve the current operating methods, and from how to give play to the wisdom of labor, requiring innovation. And at the beginning of every new reform, conservative ideas always prevailed. The Party organization must come up with correct views, so it cannot but learn. Whenever the several heads of the general branch committee encountered such new problems, in addition to learning and researching from technicians and workers, they also looked for Soviet experts, read books about Soviet advanced experience, and learned from the advanced experience of the Northeast. These practices were unconscious at first, but have now become a habit. The implementation of the practice of the Party organization dispatching inspectors to the workshop, which began in July last year, was learned from Soviet experience. As a result of the implementation, the effect was excellent, the Party organization was able to learn about the problems of workshop production in a timely manner, and assist the workshop branch and the administration in solving problems more quickly. Because of these conditions, the Party organization was able to make relatively correct resolutions in each movement; in the process of implementing the resolutions, coupled with continuous inspection and revision, it was able to break through difficulties step by step, improve imperfect experiences, and thus play the guaranteeing role of the Party organization in production.
    However, the Party organization in an enterprise can only be said to have done half the job if it only has the correct resolutions. From the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant, if the workers' class consciousness cannot be gradually improved so that they understand the significance of their labor in the national construction process and in the progress of the entire human society, then the huge potential of the workers' class cannot be brought into play. The Party organization of the Shijingshan Power Plant has done a series of arduous work in this regard. From November 1949 to March 1950, within half a year, in addition to resolutely supporting administrative plans and sending 100 outstanding workers to study at the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (at that time, many people opposed this, fearing that it would affect production), under the direct leadership of the general branch, it also opened amateur workers' training classes in stages, teaching the nature of the New Democratic country and the theory of labor creating the world, etc., and more than 800 workers and staff throughout the plant universally received a political education. In order to consolidate the educational achievements, a weekly Party class system was later established, inviting non-Party members to attend, in addition to explaining the Party Constitution, education was conducted by combining some specific examples of events that occurred in the factory to compare the differences between the new and old societies. From May 1950 onwards, the Party organization established its own propagandists and strengthened the mobilization work among the workers in the workshops. The patriotic convention movement in 1951 and the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952 rapidly improved the workers' class consciousness. In the past, the education received by workers was generally rational, but these two movements enabled workers to combine themselves with the country from practice. The in-depth patriotic convention movement began with the workers' experiences of suffering and comparing the new and old societies, realizing the significance of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland, and then used the form of patriotic conventions to combine this patriotic ideology with production. At the beginning, many people resisted this approach. For example, some people thought: "Our workshop is directly guaranteeing the realization of the national plan, and completing the plan is patriotism, so there is no need for another set." The Party leadership criticized this idea, believing that patriotic conventions can inspire workers' patriotic enthusiasm and mobilize workers' potential ability to ensure the completion or even over-completion of the national plan. Patriotic conventions can make up for the shortcomings of the national plan. Later, practice proved that the Party organization's proposition was correct. In this action, the workers created and saved wealth worth 1.5 billion yuan for the country by improving technology, saving materials, and other methods, all of which were not included in the original plan. Until now, workers still revise and check the patriotic conventions every month. In the "Three-Anti" movement of 1952, especially in the movement against waste and calculating detailed accounts, the workers further realized that it is not only patriotic to do their own production well, but more importantly, to have an attitude of "being masters of the house." When summarizing this movement, the Party general branch committee clearly pointed out to the workers that "being masters of the house" is not a simple matter. First, they must have a correct labor attitude and think about the country's wealth in everything; second, they must start from the overall interests of the country and fight against all phenomena that damage the country's interests. The successful trial burning of low-calorie coal in Red May was due to the ideological foundation among the workers, which resulted in the perseverance to overcome difficulties together. The Party organization's thinking became clearer in leading these political movements. A comrade of the general branch committee said: "Now I understand what it means to gradually raise the workers' thinking to the level of communist consciousness. It turns out that this is the driving force for promoting and improving state-owned enterprises, and it is also the ideological foundation for giving play to the workers' great creative talent." Because of a clear understanding of this point, the Party organization recently made such a plan in discussing the upcoming "July 1st" all-district grand competition: to lead the entire plant to launch a movement to learn from Soviet advanced experience, and to carry out a mass summary movement on the suggestions and improvements made by Soviet experts to the plant in the past three years, and to hold chart exhibitions so that all workers can understand: the result of learning from the experience of socialist countries has created so much wealth for our own country. This makes everyone understand that "leaning to one side" technically and opposing conservative ideas are the roads that must be taken to strive for a bright future for socialism.
    The work of the Party organization of the Shijingshan Power Plant is not without shortcomings. When reviewing, the general branch committee believes that the biggest shortcoming is the failure to mobilize the forces of all parties to overcome the difficulties in learning technology and to properly summarize the advanced experience of the workers. In the past, advanced experience had been summarized, but it was generally done more from the aspect of political mobilization, and there were few summaries that could truly explain the scientific nature of advanced experience. For example, the steam turbine workshop Sheng Xianming class has not had an accident in three years, but no one has ever summarized their experience. Those that have been summarized have not been educated and learned among the workers, which cannot make the technical reform movement a plant-wide mass movement. They believe that the policy of paying attention to politically mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm and relying on the awakened working class to overcome all difficulties in the past is correct, and it must continue to be done in the future; but if we therefore ignore the summarization and promotion of the workers' advanced experience, the discovery of the potential ability in the factory will inevitably be restricted, and the Party's leadership will fall behind the workers. Wang Zhimian, secretary of the general branch, said: "The obstacles to learning and promoting advanced experience are complacency and conservative thinking. We must also launch a movement to break conservative thinking and learn advanced experience in the upcoming big competition movement. We ourselves must also diligently learn. Only in this way can we more completely embody the Party's policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well in the factory."

    企业中的党组织应该怎样进行工作
    ——介绍石景山发电厂党组织的工作经验
    新华社记者　王定坤
    不向困难低头，在新事物面前顽强学习，——石景山发电厂的党组织就是由于发扬了党的这种优良传统而坚强起来的。
    一九四九年九月，×号发电机遭受严重破坏，这是石景山发电厂的党组织所碰到的第一个严重考验。群众的反映是：“我们塌了半个天”，耽心机器无法修复时失业；工程师们的议论是：“这不是我们的技术所能解决的，需要换新机器。”党的组织采取了与前面见解不同的态度，把坚决修复的任务勇敢地承当下来，积极建议行政号召职工加强了原有机炉的运转，并专门以修复×号电机为中心成立了一个党的小组，以加强修复期间的党的工作。这个小组进行了两方面工作：一方面是和那些故意强调困难、散布失败情绪的人作斗争；一方面以全部力量深入到修复工作中去，不只动手，而且勤于用脑钻研问题，他们和技术人员、工人们商量，尽量支持和鼓励有创造性的人们，总结和运用他们的丰富经验，克服了许多困难。党组织并号召党员，要克服一切困难，来完成这个为保证京、津、唐电力网充分发电所必须完成的任务。经过四个半月的日夜努力，终于在苏联专家的帮助下，修复了×号机，恢复发电。这一次的考验教育了党组织的领导干部——决不能随波逐流，而是顽强地逆着困难前进。
    一九五○年三月间，当石景山发电厂接受建立全厂大检修制度并进行一次恢复性的检修任务时，党组织对于克服困难的信心就更坚定了。开始时，那种惯于向困难低头的情绪仍然占着上风。一些人在讲：“老少三代的电厂，修理一下会有什么结果？”“机器用不坏也叫你们拆坏了！”……党的领导方面即积极推动工会与行政签订×号炉保证检修质量的出力合同，并选择了党的基础较好的汽机车间，培养了刘德珍模范小组，创造了检修中无返工活与消灭漏水、漏油、漏气的新纪录。党组织总结了刘德珍小组的经验，提出了“消灭七漏”（漏汽、漏油、漏水、漏煤、漏风等）的口号，并建议工会和行政方面把这个经验推广，直接保证了检修质量。这一次检修的成功，党的领导方面又学到了一条经验——在困难面前要善于突破典型，推动一般。
    一九五○年九月，厂的领导部门提出保证安全供电任务时，又遇到和以前一样的阻碍。有很多人认为：“电厂不生事故，得太阳从西边出来。”但是党的领导方面心里有底，站稳了自己的岗位，一方面指定专人进行事故分析，在工人中进行教育，说明事故是可以预先防止的，并在全厂掀起开展消灭事故的运动；另一方面，深入事故最多的电气车间，研究情况。这个运动发动的结果，全厂工人从各方面寻找出二一一九件事故发生的原因，党抓紧这件事推动工会行政，开展了一个“消灭二一一九”运动，这个运动最后取得全胜，创造一百八十三天无事故的新纪录。党组织就这样从克服困难中学习了不少好的经验。此后，在一九五一年降低煤耗，在一九五二年增产节约运动中试烧低含热量煤（劣质煤），试行快速检修等等许多厂内的重大技术改革中，都由于党组织能坚定不移地认真组织力量，依靠群众，因而保证了任务完成。
    党总支委员会的领导人是抗日战争时期的干部，他们不懂技术，但是他们有坚定的信念：“共产党人没有克服不了的困难。”总支书记王自勉说：“过去没有打过仗，打了几年就会了。干工厂和打仗不一样，但也不是学不会的。”他还说：“道路是一天天走过来的，思想也是一天一天逐渐明确起来的。开始对于电厂工作中的两个环节——安全供电和降低成本，领导方面完全是被动的。煤耗高，我们就提：‘上不冒黑烟，下不推黑煤’；变压器烧坏了，查明了原因，就提出：‘刮风下雨关窗子’，但是，这是不能解决问题的，当我们学会主动找困难、解决困难的时候，我们的工作反而不困难了。”
    在最近总支委员会上，回顾了一下三年来所走的道路，大家一致感觉到：在每一次全厂性改革运动中，都会碰到两种不同议论：一种是来自一部分有保守思想的人们中间的，强调困难，强调设备条件；一种是来自工人积极分子中间的，他们往往能从国家利益着想，从如何改善目前的操作方法、发挥劳动的智慧着想，要求革新。而在每一次新的改革开始，保守思想总是占上风的。党组织要拿出正确的主张，就不能不学习。总支委员会的几个负责人，在每一次遇到了这样的新问题时，除了向技术人员、工人学习研究外，还找苏联专家，阅读有关苏联先进经验的书籍，学习东北的先进经验，这些作法开始是不自觉的，但到现在就已经成为习惯了。去年七月开始，他们实行了党组织在车间委派检查员的作法，就是从苏联的经验中学来的。实行的结果，效果极好，党组织能及时了解到车间生产的问题，协助车间支部和行政方面较迅速地解决问题。因为有了这些条件，党组织就在每个运动中，做出比较正确的决议；在决议执行过程中再加上不断的检查和修订，就能一步步地冲破困难，使不完善的经验完善起来，因而发挥了党组织在生产上的保证作用。
    但是，企业中的党组织仅仅有了正确的决议，还只能说是做了事情的一半。从石景山发电厂的经验看，如果不能逐步提高工人阶级的觉悟，使他们理解到自己的劳动在国家建设过程中和整个人类社会前进中的意义，那么，工人阶级的巨大的潜在能力是不能发挥的。石景山发电厂的党组织在这方面作了一系列的艰苦工作。一九四九年十一月到一九五○年三月，在半年的时间内，党组织除了坚决支持行政计划，输送了一百个优秀工人到中共北京市委学习外（当时有许多人反对，怕影响生产），在总支直接领导下还分期开办了业余工人训练班，讲授新民主主义国家的性质和劳动创造世界的理论等，全厂八百余工人职员普遍地受到了一次政治教育。为了巩固教育成果，以后曾建立了每周一次的党课制度，邀请非党员听课，除讲解党章外，结合工厂所发生的一些具体事例，对比新旧社会的不同进行教育。从一九五○年五月以后，党组织建立了自己的宣传员，在车间加强了对工人的鼓动工作。一九五一年的爱国公约运动和一九五二年的“三反”运动，使工人阶级的觉悟飞速地提高了。过去工人所受的教育一般多是理性的，这两次运动却使工人从实践中把个人和国家结合起来了。爱国公约运动的深入先从诉苦对比新旧社会的工人经历开始，认识到抗美援朝保卫祖国的意义，又用爱国公约的形式，把这种爱国主义的思想和生产结合起来。开始很多人对于这种作法是有抵抗的。比如有人认为：“我们车间是在直接保证国家计划的实现，完成计划就是爱国，不必另来一套。”党的领导方面批判了这种思想，认为爱国公约能启发工人的爱国热忱、能发动工人的潜在能力，以保证完成甚至超额完成国家计划。爱国公约可以补国家计划的不足。后来在实际中证明党组织的主张是正确的。工人们在这次行动中用改进技术、节约材料等办法共为国家创造和节约财富十五亿元，这些都是原来的计划中没有包括进去的。直到现在，工人们仍然每月修订和检查爱国公约。一九五二年的“三反”运动，特别是反浪费、算细账运动中，工人进一步认识到不仅把自己生产做好是爱国，更重要是有“当家作主”的态度。党的总支委员会在总结这一段运动时，明确地给工人指出“当家作主”这件事不简单，第一要自己有正确的劳动态度，事事能为国家的财富着想；第二要从国家的整体利益出发，和一切破坏国家利益的现象作斗争。红五月试烧低含热量煤成功，就是由于工人中有了这样的思想基础，因而产生了共同克服困难的毅力。党组织在领导这几次政治运动中思想上亮起来了，总支委员会的一个同志说：“现在才懂得了要把工人们的思想逐渐提高到共产主义觉悟水平是什么意思，原来这就是推动和改进国家企业的动力，也是发挥工人阶级的巨大创造才能的思想基础。”由于明确认识了这一点，党组织最近在讨论迎接“七一”全区大竞赛中作出这样的计划：领导全厂开展一个学习苏联先进经验的运动，对三年来苏联专家对于本厂的建议和改进开展一个群众性的总结运动，举行图表展览，使全体工人懂得：学习社会主义国家的经验的结果，为我们自己的国家创造了多少财富这就使大家了解技术上的“一面倒”和反对保守思想是争取社会主义的美好将来所必须走的道路。
    石景山发电厂党组织的工作中不是没有缺点的，总支委员会在检讨时认为最大的缺点是没有动员各方面的力量克服在学习技术上的困难，好好总结工人的先进经验。过去不是没有做过先进经验的总结，但一般从政治鼓动方面做的多，真正能说明先进经验的科学性的总结很少。例如，汽机场生咸明班三年来没有一次事故，但谁也没有总结过他们的经验。已总结了的也没有在工人中间开展教育和学习，这就不能使技术改革运动成为全厂性的群众运动。他们认为，过去注意了从政治上发动工人积极性，依靠觉悟起来的工人阶级克服一切困难的方针是正确的，今后也必须如此做；但是如果因此就忽视了总结和推广工人中的先进经验，工厂中潜在能力的发掘必然会受到限制，党的领导也就会落在工人的后面。总支书记王自勉说：“学习推广先进经验的障碍是自满和保守思想，我们还必须在行将到来的大竞赛运动中开展一个打破保守思想、学习先进经验的运动，我们自己也必须顽强地学习，只有这样才能比较完整地在工厂中体现党依靠工人阶级办好企业的政策。”
