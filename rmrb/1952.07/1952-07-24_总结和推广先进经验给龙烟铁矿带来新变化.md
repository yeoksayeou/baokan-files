Summarizing and Promoting Advanced Experiences Brings New Changes to Longyan Iron Mine
By our reporter Lin Mo

Why is Production Sometimes High, Sometimes Low?

The state-owned Longyan Iron Mine is a nationally renowned large iron mine. The main production department of this mine – the Mining Department – previously continuously carried out labor competitions and achieved certain results. However, the leading cadres of this mine did not pay much attention to helping workers improve their skills and improve labor organization, and they did not know how to summarize and promote advanced experiences. Their mobilization of competitions mostly relied on simple political appeals. Workers participating in the competition mostly focused on simply strengthening labor intensity, rather than finding "tricks." This kind of approach, of course, cannot be sustained. Therefore, the production of this mine often experienced high and low fluctuations: in the early part of the month, it often failed to complete the task; it was better in the middle of the month; everyone became nervous in the latter part of the month; in the last few days of the month, they made all-out efforts to make a breakthrough, and finally over-fulfilled the monthly task, and sometimes even achieved new records. At this time, everyone celebrated with gongs and drums and held grand meetings. However, how exactly were the new records created? What experiences were inside? How to consolidate in the future? The Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations lacked research and did not pay enough attention to these important issues.

Longyan Iron Mine has national, provincial, municipal, and mine-level labor models, model groups, and model tunnels. Leading cadres often call on them to play a leading role in production, but rarely summarize and promote their advanced experiences. The achievements of labor model Ma Wanshui's tunneling team were very prominent, and they created rich advanced experiences, but the leaders did not summarize and promote them, but simply announced their production achievements. Many workers did not believe it and were unconvinced, saying that the leaders were biased towards the Ma Wanshui team.

Before the "Three-Anti" movement, some leading cadres in the Eastern, Central, and Western Mining Departments had departmentalism. The three departments looked down on each other. This kind of departmentalism, combined with the backward and conservative thinking among the workers, consciously or unconsciously resisted new things and advanced experiences. At that time, the Ma Wanshui team worked in the Central Department. When some leading cadres in the Eastern and Western Departments mentioned the Ma Wanshui team, they shook their heads and said: "Isn't it just the same old thing!" The general workers believed: "The Ma Wanshui team is good because the leaders take care of them. If I had those conditions, I could do that too!" At this time, the workers in the Mining Department had a common argument for creating new records: exert effort, try your luck, and feel unconvinced in your heart.

The leading cadres of Longyan Iron Mine in the past did not deeply understand the specific problems existing in production, and did not seriously and carefully study methods to improve technology and improve labor organization. They were unclear about the situation, and had great blindness in their work. In 1951, the state gave the mine a production task of ××10,000 tons. At first, the leading cadres were worried that they could not complete it, but the result exceeded the plan by 25 percent. In 1952, the state gave the task of increasing by 113.3 percent compared to 1951 under the original equipment and labor force conditions. The factory director accepted this task with the greatest courage and determination. However, to what extent has the utilization rate of the mine's mechanical equipment reached? How much potential power still exists in terms of labor and technical equipment? What is the key to increasing production? Many cadres of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League were still unaware of these issues.

Found the Key Problems

In May of this year, the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government and the China Metal Smelting Trade Union sent a group of cadres to cooperate with the cadres of Longyan Iron Mine to organize a work group of nearly 30 people (including administrative, trade union cadres and technicians) to specifically summarize the advanced experience of the Ma Wanshui team. The summary work was carried out simultaneously in the advanced Ma Wanshui team and several other general teams. The work group spent more than a month implementing on-site observation, measurement, comparison, and multiple analyses and studies. It not only summarized the advanced experience of the Ma Wanshui team, but also found the key to generally improving production in each team.

The leading cadres of Longyan Iron Mine learned through this summary that the technical level of most workers was very backward, and they had been using the old methods for a long time. When tunneling, no matter what kind of stone they encountered, the angle, depth, density, and amount of explosives used were almost the same. This was completely opposite to the Ma Wanshui team's use of different slotting methods for different rocks. This difference between advanced and backward was very significantly manifested when the advanced experience of the Ma Wanshui team was first promoted. The Zhou Wenhui work shift of Tunnel 33 initially learned a "side wedge slotting method" of the Ma Wanshui team in three or four days, and the daily output increased by 80 percent.

The reason why the technical level of most workers is backward is because the mine lacks due technical guidance for old workers, and lacks preliminary technical training for a large number of new workers. The tunnel technicians and foremen are responsible for providing technical guidance to the workers, but most of them are entangled in daily administrative affairs. Therefore, in order to improve the production situation, it is also necessary to improve the tunnel management system and give full play to the role of technical personnel.

There are still many serious problems with the labor organization of this mine. The work of many production teams in the tunnel lacks good organization and planning. The responsibility system and various group systems are not implemented, the work is chaotic, and serious waste of manpower and materials is caused. When people are working, they often stop to find tools and wait for materials. Sometimes people wait for work, and sometimes work waits for people. When five people work for eight hours at the same time, they often "find" and "wait" dozens of times, wasting a total of three or four hundred minutes of work time. According to the group's staffing, there is a surplus of manpower. Some people have nothing to do in the tunnel, so they casually find some odd jobs to kill time. Some group leaders and squad leaders, under the pretext of guiding production, do not do the main work, and become auxiliary workers doing miscellaneous work. The quality of labor organization is concentrated in the use of wind power. According to actual measurement, the general tunneling team only uses about 50 percent of the wind power; the advanced Ma Wanshui team uses more than 90 percent of the wind power because of the good work organization. That is to say, the tunneling efficiency of Longyan Iron Mine is reduced by about 30 to 40 percent due to the poor organization of labor and the low utilization rate of mechanical equipment.

The leading cadres of Longyan Iron Mine began to understand the details of the work from the lower level through this summary, and found some key problems in production and the advanced experience to solve these problems. In this way, leading production is no longer blind.

Promote Advanced Experience and Improve Leadership Methods

The leading cadres of Longyan Iron Mine have made up their minds to change the past leadership methods of bureaucratism and preoccupation with routine affairs without a clear focus of work and without going deep into the work. The harm of this work method is great. Not long ago, the Mining Department instructed the cadres of each tunnel to conduct ideological mobilization among the workers in preparation for promoting advanced experience. Some tunnel cadres put this matter in a very secondary position and still busy themselves with their so-called "central" work. The leaders of the Mining Department did not investigate this situation, nor did they help the tunnel cadres to specifically study and arrange these tasks, but simply called and arranged, of course, no good results would occur.

Now the leading cadres of Longyan Iron Mine are arranging and planning the work of various departments around the central link of promoting advanced experience and organizing competitions, organizing and mobilizing the personnel of the entire mine to act under a unified goal. Factory Director Ma Shugan deeply feels that they need to conduct a resolute struggle against their own preoccupation with routine affairs and bureaucratic habits in the future. On the other hand, the relevant leading departments of Longyan Iron Mine also need to change the past leadership methods of simply issuing orders, instructions, and holding meetings, and go to learn more about the actual situation, consult more with the cadres of the mine, and provide specific help and guidance to the lower levels; otherwise, it will increase the difficulty of the work below. For example: June was the month to prepare for the competition, and the leading cadres of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League of Longyan Iron Mine went to Beijing, Chahar Province, and Xuanhua City to attend meetings of the leading organs in turn, so that they could not find a time to discuss work together in the first 25 days of this month. Too many meetings have become a burden on the lower levels, which needs to be paid attention to by the leadership of Xuanhua City.

    总结和推广先进经验给龙烟铁矿带来新变化
    本报记者  林沫
    为什么生产忽高忽低
    国营龙烟铁矿是全国闻名的大铁矿。这个矿的主要生产部门——采矿部，过去曾经不断地开展劳动竞赛，并且获得了一定的成绩。但是，这个矿的领导干部却不大注意帮助工人提高技术，改进劳动组织，更不晓得总结和推广先进经验；他们发动竞赛，多半是依靠单纯的政治号召。工人进行竞赛，多半是单纯加强劳动强度，而不去寻找“窍门”。这样的干法，当然不能持久。因此，这个矿的生产，经常出现忽高忽低的现象：每月初旬，往往是完不成任务；到中旬就好一些；到下旬大家就紧张了；到月末的几天，就全力突击，最后终于超额完成一月的任务，有时还出现了一些新纪录。这时候，大家敲锣打鼓开大会，热热闹闹地庆祝一番。但是，究竟新纪录是怎样创造的？里边有些什么经验？今后怎么巩固？对于这些重要问题，党、行政、工会、青年团的组织是缺乏研究和不够重视的。
    龙烟铁矿有全国的、省的、市的和本矿的劳动模范和模范小组与模范坑道。领导干部经常号召他们在生产中起带头作用，但却很少总结和推广他们的先进经验。劳动模范马万水掘进组的成绩是十分突出的，他们创造了丰富的先进经验，领导方面却不加以总结和推广，只是简单地公布他们的生产成绩。很多工人不相信，不服气，说这是领导干部偏向马万水组。
    在“三反”运动以前，采矿东、中、西三部的某些领导干部，存在着本位主义思想。三部互相瞧不起。这种本位主义思想和工人中间的落后保守思想结合起来，自觉地或不自觉地抵抗新鲜事物和先进经验。当时马万水组在中部工作，东部和西部的某些领导干部提起马万水组，就摇摇头说：“还不是那一套！”一般工人都认为：“马万水小组好，是领导干部照顾，给我那样的条件，我也能作那些！”这时，采矿部的工人对创造新纪录有一种普遍的论调是：卖力气，碰运气，自己心里不服气。
    龙烟铁矿的领导干部过去没有深入地了解生产中存在的具体问题，没有认真、细致地研究提高技术和改进劳动组织的办法，他们心中无数，在工作中有很大的盲目性。一九五一年，国家给这个矿的生产任务是××万吨，最初领导干部耽心完不成，结果超过计划百分之二十五。一九五二年国家给予的任务，是在原有设备和劳动力的条件下，比一九五一年增加百分之一百十三点三。厂长用最大的勇气和决心接受了这个任务。但是，全矿的机械设备利用率究竟达到了什么程度？劳动力和技术设备方面究竟还存在着多大的潜在力量？提高生产的关键何在？对这些问题，党、行政、工会、青年团的很多干部还是不摸底细。
    找到了关键问题
    今年五月，中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局和中国五金冶炼工会派了一部分干部，协同龙烟铁矿的干部，组织了一个近三十人的工作组（包括行政、工会干部和技术人员），专门总结了马万水组的先进经验。总结工作是在先进的马万水组和其他几个一般的组同时进行的。工作组用了一个多月的时间，实行现场观察、测定、对比和多次的分析研究，不但总结了马万水组的先进经验，同时也找到了在各组普遍提高生产的关键。
    龙烟铁矿的领导干部经过这次总结，了解到大多数工人的技术水平十分落后，长期使用着老一套的工作方法，在掘进时，不论遇到什么石头，所打的眼的角度、深度、密度和装药的多少，差不多都是一样。这和马万水组对不同的岩石运用不同的掏槽方法是完全相反的。这种先进和落后的差别，在刚刚推广马万水组的先进经验的时候就非常显著地表现出来了。三十三号坑道周文惠工作班用三、四天的时间，初步学习了马万水组的一种“旁楔形掏槽法”，日产量就提高了百分之八十。
    大多数工人的技术水平所以落后，是因为矿方对老工人缺乏应有的技术指导，对大批新工人缺乏初步的技术训练。坑道的技术员、领班本是负责对工人进行技术指导的，但他们大多被日常的行政事务纠缠住了。因此，为了改进生产状况，还必须改进坑道的管理制度；发挥技术人员应有的作用。
    这个矿的劳动组织还存在着许多严重的问题。坑道内的许多生产组的工作，缺乏很好的组织和计划，专责制和各种小组制度没有贯彻，工作忙乱，造成严重的人力、物力的浪费。人们在工作时，经常停下来去找工具，等材料。有时是人等工作，有时是工作等人。五个人同时工作八小时，常常“找”“等”达几十次之多，共浪费工时达三、四百分钟。按照小组的编制，人力是有富余的。有些人在坑道中无活干，就随便找些零活混时间。有些组长和班长藉口指导生产，不干主要工作，变成干杂活的辅助工。劳动组织的好坏，集中表现在对风力的使用上。根据实际测定，一般掘进组只使用风力百分之五十左右；先进的马万水组，因为工作组织的好，风力使用达百分之九十以上。这就是说，龙烟铁矿的掘进工作，因劳动力组织得不好，机械设备利用率太低，掘进效率约降低了百分之三十到四十。
    龙烟铁矿的领导干部通过这次总结，开始从下层摸清了工作的底细，找到了生产中的某些关键问题和解决这些问题的先进经验。这样，领导生产就不再是盲目的了。
    推广先进经验，改进领导方法
    龙烟铁矿的领导干部已经下决心改变过去那种缺乏明确的工作中心、工作不深入的事务主义和官僚主义的领导方法。这种工作方法的为害是很大的。在不久以前，采矿部曾经指示各坑道的干部，向工人进行思想动员，准备推广先进经验，有些坑道干部把这件事情放在很次要的地位，仍旧忙他们的所谓“中心”工作。采矿部领导方面不考察这种情况，也不帮助坑道干部具体研究和安排这些工作，只是简单地号召和布置，当然不会发生良好的效果。
    现在龙烟铁矿的领导干部正在围绕着推广先进经验、组织竞赛这个中心环节，来安排和计划各个部门的工作，组织和动员全矿的人员，在统一的目标下行动起来。厂长马叔干同志深深感到，他们今后需要和自己的事务主义及官僚主义习气进行坚决的斗争。另一方面，也需要龙烟铁矿的有关领导部门，改变过去那种单纯地下命令，发指示和召开会议的领导方法，而去多多了解实际情况，多和矿上的干部商量，并对下级进行具体的帮助和指导；不然，就会给下边的工作增加困难。例如：六月份正是准备竞赛的一个月，而龙烟铁矿的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部，因轮番到北京、察哈尔省和宣化市的领导机关开会，以致在这一个月的前二十五天中，竟找不到一个时间在一起讨论工作。过多的会议对下边已经成为负担，这点须要宣化市领导方面加以注意。
