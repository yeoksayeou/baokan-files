According to your news reports, last week your side killed one of our captured personnel and wounded three in the Jeju Island POW camp, and wounded four of our captured personnel in the Yongcho Island POW camp.

To Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Enclosed is a list of 4,391 of our captured personnel for your side. These names are all listed on the list of prisoners of war that your side transferred to our side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, but are not included in the list of prisoners of war that your side submitted to our side. There is no doubt that these 4,391 personnel of our side have been captured and detained as prisoners of war by your army. Our side demands that your side provide a detailed and satisfactory explanation for this.
