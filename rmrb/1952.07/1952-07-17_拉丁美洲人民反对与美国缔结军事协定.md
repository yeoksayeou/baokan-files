(Xinhua News Agency, July 12th) According to TASS: In order to intensify its enslavement of Latin American countries, the United States government is forcing these countries to conclude military agreements with the United States under the guise of "common security." However, the US government's aggressive policy of relying on "US aid" to buy off and expand armaments has been repeatedly frustrated by the strong opposition of the Latin American people.

So far, three countries—Mexico, Guatemala, and Argentina—have refused to conclude military agreements with the United States due to pressure from their people. In addition, although the governments of six countries—Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay—have concluded such agreements with the United States, the protest movements of the people in these countries are expanding daily.

In Chile, in recent weeks, protests against the US-Chile military agreement have swept the country. Broad masses of the Chilean people, various political parties and mass organizations, and even lower-level members of right-wing parties that support the agreement have risen up to oppose the Congress's ratification of the agreement. Demonstrations and marches are held daily throughout the country. On the day the Congress discussed the agreement, the people of the capital, Santiago, held a protest demonstration in front of the Congress building. On July 1st, in the Concepcion mining and industrial center, 5,000 miners and textile workers held a 24-hour strike. Students held a strike in support. Women gathered to criticize the government's policy. "Democracia" reported on the Chilean people's determination to oppose the ratification of the US-Chile military agreement, saying: "These demonstrations and protest rallies held to oppose war, defend peace and national sovereignty show that the Congress's vote does not reflect the feelings of the vast majority of the Chilean people."

The people of Uruguay also strongly oppose the ratification of the US-Uruguay military agreement. The representatives of the National Peace Committee and local peace committees, along with 316,000 people who signed the declaration requesting the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, oppose this agreement. Representatives of various political parties and religions, workers of the General Confederation of Labor and members of various autonomous trade unions, women under the leadership of the Women's Federation, and patriotic youth under the leadership of students have risen up to oppose the conclusion of this agreement with the United States. Currently, the "Uruguayan Haya de la Torre Youth Anti-Imperialist Movement" organization is collecting signatures to oppose the conclusion of this agreement.

The Brazilian National Peace Committee also issued a statement, pointing out that in Brazil, approximately four million people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. This proves that the Brazilian people oppose the policy of expanding armaments and militarization, and oppose the policy of concluding military agreements.

    拉丁美洲人民反对与美国缔结军事协定
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社讯：美国政府为了加紧奴役拉丁美洲各国，正以“共同安全”为名，强迫这些国家与美国缔结军事协定。但是，美国政府这种依靠“美援”来收买和扩张军备的侵略政策，在拉丁美洲人民的坚强反对下，接连不断地遭到挫折。
    迄今为止，已有三个国家——墨西哥、危地马拉和阿根廷因为受到人民的压力而表示拒绝和美国缔结军事协定。此外巴西、哥伦比亚、智利、乌拉圭等六个国家的政府，虽然已和美国缔结了这种协定。但是，这些国家中的人民抗议运动正日益扩大。
    在智利，最近几个星期以来，反对美智军事协定的抗议运动已席卷全国。智利广大阶层群众、各种政治党派和群众团体，甚至赞成这个协定的右翼政党的下层党员都起来反对国会批准这个协定。全国各地天天举行示威游行。当国会讨论这个协定的那一天，首都圣地牙哥的人民在国会大厦前举行了抗议示威。七月一日，在公塞普森矿区和工业中心，五千矿工和纺织工人举行了二十四小时的罢工。学生们为此举行了罢课。妇女们集会，抨击政府的政策。“民主报”报道智利人民反对批准美智军事协定的决心说：“为反对战争、维护和平与国家主权而举行的这些示威游行和抗议大会，表明了国会的表决并不能反映绝大多数智利人民的情绪。”
    乌拉圭人民也强烈反对批准美乌军事协定。全国和平委员会与各地方和平委员会代表在要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的三十一万六千人，反对这个协定。各政党和各种宗教的代表们，加入总工会的工人和各种自治工会的会员们，在妇女联合会领导下的妇女们，在学生领导下的爱国青年们都起来反对与美国缔结这种协定。现在，“乌拉圭海列罗青年反帝运动”组织正为反对缔结这个协定而征集签名。
    巴西全国和平委员会也发表声明，指出：在巴西，已有约四百万人在世界和平理事会关于要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。这证明了巴西人民反对扩张军备和军国主义化的政策，反对缔结军事协定的政策。
