    The Hero Who Conquered the Hudu River
    By our reporter Bai Yuan

    On the construction site of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, an event occurred that was widely praised. This event tells people how the people who have already obtained a happy life are fighting for their happiness, and how they have unleashed infinite power in this struggle.

    In March, continuous raindrops fell along the Yangtze River. A team participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project arrived at the construction site from Songzi County on the south bank of the Yangtze River. They were all farmers from the Tenth District of Songzi County, a total of six thousand five hundred men and women. They had just completed land reform and came to participate in the great construction project of the motherland under the leadership of County Magistrate Rao Mintai. At that time, the entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project had not yet begun.

    After the project started, a flood control gate for the flood diversion area had to be built in the lower reaches of the Hudu River. This required cutting off the river in the upper reaches, otherwise the sluice gate could not be started. A lot of equipment for building the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate had to be transported from the west bank of the Hudu River to the east bank. This required solving the transportation problem first. Therefore, the higher authorities decided to build a temporary dam at the mouth of the Hudu River on the south side of the Yangtze River to cut off the river, and lay light rails on the dam to transport equipment from the west bank of the Hudu River. The urgent task of building the dam was to be borne by this team.

    The banks of the Hudu River stood with cliffs, and the turbulent currents of the Yangtze River flowed from the river mouth, carrying undulating waves. On the more than 500-meter-wide river, they threw large amounts of stones, grass bags, and soil from the west bank of the Hudu River to the bottom of the river, and then, stepping on the earth dam that had emerged from the water, they advanced towards the east bank. The newly thrown stones stirred up countless waves. The river water swirled around the rocks protruding from the water, flowing angrily.

    Rao Mintai, who commanded this team, had led guerrilla teams in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, fighting heroically against the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on his native land. Now, in the position of building the motherland, just like in the battlefields of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, he would work with everyone to subdue this raging river for the happy life of the people. He was with this team day and night, carrying soil, digging soil, moving stones, and directing the team to build the dam across the river. The dam extended towards the east bank day by day, only thirty meters away from the opposite bank. Now the stones, grass bags, and soil thrown into the water were all washed away by the river. People began to use iron cables to tie up ships and build pontoon bridges, throwing boulders into the water day and night to block the gap. The dam continued to advance. However, the further the work went, the more difficult it became. A four-hundred-jin stone thrown into the river was immediately washed away. Throwing boulders was no longer useful. Someone suggested using the method of sinking ships to block the fierce river water. After everyone's discussion, a thirty-ton wooden boat was loaded with stones and sunk into the river. Who knew that before it sank to the bottom of the river, the wooden boat and a full boat of stones were washed away by the river at once.

    These people who lived on the banks of the Yangtze River had, in the past, spent nine months of the year repairing dikes and preventing floods because floods were rampant every year. They had accumulated rich experience in fighting against floods. However, in the past, no matter how rich their experience and wisdom were, they could never overcome floods and could never protect their lives. In the era of the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, no one carried out comprehensive water conservancy construction; the people fighting floods built the dike in one place, and the dike in another place was broken by floods. In the end, people were still driven away by floods and went to wander in other lands. In those dark years, they repaired dikes and prevented floods all year round. The cotton and grain that they were fortunate enough to harvest, in addition to paying rent and taxes, had to pay one and a half catties of lint cotton and eleven catties of rice per mu of land for dike repair fees to the government. Their marrow and blood were all squeezed dry. Now, facing this fierce river water, they realized the test that a happy life had given them. They gathered in groups by the Hudu River. Some people said to throw stones tied into willow pillows into the river; some people said to throw stones packed in bamboo cages into the river; finally, it was decided to throw willow pillows and bamboo cages into the river together.

    In that crowd, there was a twenty-two-year-old young farmer named Ding Yongshan. His father was forced to death by the landlord very early, he grazed cattle for the landlord when he was very young, and worked as a hired laborer for the landlord when he grew up a little, living a difficult life with his mother under the oppression of the landlord. After liberation, he was elected as the township head by the masses in Dingjiawan Township, Tenth District of Songzi County. This time, participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, as a squadron leader, he led the people of his township to the construction site. Now, he led the pillow-tying team composed of the people of his township to fight against the fierce river water. Willow pillows and bamboo cages, each containing five or six thousand catties of stones, were thrown into the river along the pontoon bridge built of wooden boats. However, torrential rain poured down from the sky. The wind blew the rain, setting off huge waves on the river. By night, the pontoon bridge could not be stabilized, so the ships had to be withdrawn, and willow pillows and bamboo cages continued to be thrown from both banks. The howling wind and rain roared in the dark wilderness. Suddenly, a mountain-collapsing roar came from the east bank of the Hudu River. The east bank of the Hudu River began to collapse. If the bank of the Hudu River was broken by the water, not only would the entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project be unable to proceed, but it would immediately cause flooding. At this time, the east bank urgently needed willow branches for tying pillows, and the willow branches had to be transported from the west bank. Ding Yongshan, who was fighting the river on the east bank, saw that the pontoon bridge had been dismantled, but the shouts of the crowds on both sides and the sound of the water were mixed together, making it impossible to inform the people on the opposite bank of the situation. Time could not wait for him to consider more issues. He and another farmer, Ding Renwei, ran to the roaring bank, stepped on a small boat without oars. Ding Renwei stood in the front, he stood in the back, and the two of them used their hands to climb the iron cables left over from the dismantled pontoon bridge, preparing to climb to the earth dam that had already been built on the opposite bank. Before they climbed to the earth dam, a huge wave rolled Ding Yongshan into the river. The rolling currents of the Hudu River roared in the dark night. The howling wind and rain and the vast river water were connected as one. Ding Renwei, grabbing the swaying iron cable, woke up from a dizzy spell. He saw Ding Yongshan raising a hand in the swirling waves, and then he was submerged again. The swirling river water rolled Ding Yongshan from one end of the iron cable to the other. A wave turned him up from the river water, and he grabbed the iron cable, and was rescued from the water by Ding Renwei. The two of them hurriedly climbed ashore, found Rao Mintai who was running in the dark wind and rain. They continued to fight the fierce river water until dawn.

    When it dawned, the rain stopped. But the river water had risen by three meters. After days and nights of fighting, only fourteen meters of the dam's gap remained. However, in the evening, people discovered that some of the willow pillows and bamboo cages thrown into the river had been washed away by the rising river water. The riverbank on the east bank of the Hudu River continued to collapse. People saw that the moment of the final battle had arrived. They prepared a large wooden boat of ninety tons and another of one hundred and thirty tons. The ninety-ton wooden boat was filled with stones at the gap, but as soon as it was sunk, it was washed away. Then, the one hundred and thirty-ton wooden boat was pulled to the gap by the people, and the wooden boat was tied with iron cables from both banks and filled with stones. Just as the iron cables were about to be untied to sink the boat, with a deafening sound, on the dark river water, a white light was emitted from the place where an iron cable buttoned the boat, followed by sparks flying more than ten feet away. The wooden boat was torn into two sections by the turbulent currents. One section was washed away by the water, and the other section was hung by a few remaining iron cables. The swirling river water continued to impact this lonely section of wooden boat, making sounds like swallowing the entire world. At this time, Rao Mintai gathered the people and discussed ways to salvage the situation. Everyone said that there was no other way except to throw willow pillows. They suggested using larger willow pillows than before, and changing the previous throwing method from horizontal throwing to oblique throwing, arranging the willow pillows in a figure-eight shape and throwing them into the river to reduce the impact of the torrent. Their suggestions were accepted, and willow pillows, each weighing seventeen or eighteen thousand catties, were quickly bundled up and thrown into the river according to their method. The gap became narrower and narrower. At this time, it was necessary to step on the boat to transport the willow pillows to the middle of the gap in order to finally block the gap. But many people looked at the roaring river water and, remembering the scene of the large wooden boat being torn apart just now, did not dare to go on the boat. At this time, Rao Mintai ran out of the crowd and ran to the boat first. The rolling crowd followed him, and finally, after eight days and seven nights of earth-shattering struggle, blocked the river water on that night.

    Now, the entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been completed, and two huge flood control sluice gates are shining brightly on the land of New China. This is the achievement created by those who fought for a permanent happy life and for the heroic cause of building the motherland.

    战胜虎渡河的英雄
    本报记者    白原
    在荆江分洪工程的工地上，曾经发生了一件为人们到处传颂的事情。这件事情告诉人们：已经获得了幸福的生活的人民，是怎样为他们的幸福而斗争，他们在这个斗争中，怎样发挥了无穷的力量。
    三月里，长江沿岸正下着连绵的雨点。有一队参加荆江分洪工程的队伍，从长江南岸的松滋县到达了工地。他们都是松滋县第十区的农民，男男女女共有六千五百人。他们刚刚完成了土地改革，就在县长饶民太领导下，前来参加祖国的伟大的建设工程。那时候，整个荆江分洪工程还没有开始。
    工程开始以后，要在虎渡河的下游建筑分洪区的节制闸。这就必须在上游把河流截断，否则水闸就无法开工。建筑太平口进洪闸的许多器材，要从虎渡河西岸运到东岸来。这就必须首先解决运输问题。因此，上级决定在长江南面的虎渡河口，修筑一道临时的拦河坝将河流截断，并且在拦河坝上铺设轻便铁道，运输虎渡河西岸的器材。修筑拦河坝的急迫的任务，就由这一个队伍来负担。
    虎渡河岸边峭壁屹立，长江的激流从河口流过，带着一个个起伏的浪涛。他们在五百多公尺宽的江水上，从虎渡河西岸向江底抛下大量的石头、草包和泥土，然后踏着已经填出水面的土坝，向东岸推进。新抛下的石头激起无数波浪。江水打着漩涡，绕过那些突出水面的石头，愤怒地奔流着。
    指挥这个队伍的饶民太，在抗日战争和解放战争中，曾经领导过游击队，在故乡的土地上和日寇及蒋介石匪帮作过英勇的斗争。现在，他在建设祖国的岗位上，和过去在抗日战争及解放战争的阵地上一样，为了人民的幸福的生活，要和大家一起来把这汹涌的江水制服。他日夜和这个队伍在一起挑土、挖土、搬石头，指挥着队伍把横过河流的拦河坝筑起来。河坝一天天地向着东岸伸延，距离对岸只有三十多公尺了。现在往水里倒下的石头、草包和泥土，都被江水冲走了。人们开始用铁缆缚着船只，架起浮桥，日夜不停地往水里抛蛮石，进行堵口。河坝继续往前推进。但是，工作越往后越困难，四百斤重的石头抛在河中，立刻就被冲走了。抛蛮石也没有用了。有人提议用沉船的办法将凶猛的江水堵住。经过大家讨论，把一只三十吨重的木船，装满了石头，沉到江里去。谁知还没有沉到江底，木船以及满满一船的石头，被江水一下子冲走了。
    这些居住在长江岸上的人们，在过去，因为洪水年年泛滥，每年要用九个月的时间修堤防汛。他们在和洪水作斗争中，积蓄了丰富的经验。但是，在过去，不管他们有多么丰富的经验和智慧，始终不能战胜洪水，始终无法保住生活。在国民党匪帮统治时代，没有人去进行全面的水利建设；和洪水搏斗的人们把一个地方的堤岸筑起来，另一个地方的堤岸又被洪水冲破了。到头来人们还是被洪水驱赶着，到异乡去流浪。在那暗无天日的岁月里，他们一年到头修堤防汛，侥幸收获下来的棉花、粮食，除了缴纳租税以外，每亩田地还要向官府缴纳一斤半皮棉和十一斤米的修堤费。他们的膏血都被榨干了。现在，他们面对着这凶猛的江水，意识到幸福的生活给予他们的考验。他们一群一群地聚在虎渡河边。有人说将石头捆成柳枕往江里抛；有人说用竹笼装石头往江里抛；最后决定把柳枕和竹笼一齐抛到江里去。
    在那一片人群里，有一个二十二岁的叫丁永善的年青农民。他的父亲很早就被地主逼死了，他很小就给地主放牛，稍稍长大了就给地主当雇工，和母亲一起，在地主的压迫下过着艰难的日子。解放后，他在松滋县第十区的丁家?乡，被群众选为乡长。这次参加荆江分洪工程，他作为一个中队长，带领着本乡的人们，来到工地上。现在，他带领着本乡的人们所组成的捆枕队，和凶猛的江水搏斗。一个个装着五、六千斤重的石头的柳枕和竹笼，沿着那木船搭成的浮桥抛进江里。但是，倾盆大雨从天空倾倒下来了。风刮着雨，在江水上掀起了巨浪。到了晚上，浮桥都搭不稳了，只好将船只撤去，继续从两岸抛柳枕和竹笼。狂风暴雨在黑夜的荒野里咆哮着。突然，虎渡河东岸传来一声山崩一样的巨响。虎渡河的东堤开始崩倒下来了。如果虎渡河的堤岸被水冲破，不仅整个荆江分洪工程无法进行，而且立刻就会引起洪水的泛滥。这时候，东岸急需捆枕的柳条，而柳条要由西岸运过来。正在东岸和江水搏斗的丁永善看看浮桥已经拆去，但两岸的人群的喊声和水流声响成一片，无法将情况告诉对岸的人们。时间不能等待他去考虑更多的问题。他和另一个农民丁人伟跑到那咆哮着的岸边，踏上一只无桨的小艇，丁人伟站在前头，他站在后面，两个人用手攀着拆去的浮桥所剩下的铁缆，准备攀到对岸已经筑起的土坝上去。他们还没有攀到土坝上，一个巨浪将丁永善卷到江里。虎渡河里的滚滚的激流，在黑夜里咆哮着。狂风暴雨和茫茫的江水连成一片。丁人伟抓着那根摇摇荡荡的铁缆，从一阵晕眩里苏醒过来。他看见丁永善在旋卷的浪涛里伸起一只手，接着又被淹没了。旋卷的江水把丁永善从铁缆的这一头卷到了另一头，一个波浪将他从江水里翻起来，他这才抓住铁缆，被丁人伟从水里救起来。他们两个人急急地爬上了岸，找着了正在黑夜的风雨里奔跑着的饶民太。他们继续和凶猛的江水搏斗，直到天明。
    天亮的时候，雨停了。但是江水却暴涨了三公尺。经过几天几夜的搏斗，现在河坝的缺口只剩下十四公尺了。但是，到了晚上，人们发现抛到江里的柳枕和竹笼，有些已被暴涨的江水冲走了。虎渡河东岸的河堤还在继续崩倒。人们看见，最后搏斗的时刻来到了。他们准备了一只九十吨和一只一百三十吨的大木船。那只九十吨的木船在缺口上装满了石头，但一凿沈，就被冲走了。接着，一百三十吨的大木船被人们拉到缺口上，从两岸用铁缆将木船缚住，在船上装满了石头。正要解开铁缆将船沈下的时候，随着一声惊天动地的响声，在黑夜的江水上，从一根铁缆扣住船只的地方，发出一道白光，接着飞起一丈多远的火星，这只木船被翻腾的激流撕成了两节。一节被水冲走了，另一节被几根剩下的铁缆牵挂着。旋卷的江水继续冲击着这一节孤零零的木船，发出一声声像要吞没整个世界一样的吼声。这时候，饶民太将人们找来，商量挽救这种局面的办法。大家说：除了抛柳枕以外，没有其他的办法。他们建议用比以前更大的柳枕，而且要改变以前的抛法，将横抛改为斜抛，把柳枕摆成八字形抛到江里去，这样来减少激流冲击的力量。他们的建议被接受了，一个个一万七、八千斤重的柳枕迅速被捆扎起来，按照他们的办法，抛到江里去。缺口愈来愈窄了。这时候，需要踏着船将柳枕运到缺口当中，以便最后将缺口堵住。但是许多人看着那咆哮的江水，想起刚才那只大木船被裂断的情景，都不敢到船上去。饶民太这时候从人群里跑出来，首先跑到船上去。滚滚的人群跟着他，终于在经过了八天七夜的惊天动地的斗争之后，在那一个夜里将江水堵住了。
    现在，整个荆江分洪工程已经完工，两座巨大的控制洪水的水闸，在新中国的土地上放着灿烂的光辉。这就是那些为了永久的幸福的生活，为了建设祖国的英雄事业而斗争的人们创造的业绩。
