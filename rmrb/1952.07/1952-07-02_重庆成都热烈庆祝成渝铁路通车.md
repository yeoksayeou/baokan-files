Amidst the applause and cheers of tens of thousands of people, he cut the colored ribbon and opened the road to economic prosperity for the people of Sichuan. The train, covered in flowers, slowly started moving forward. The roar of the train, the cheers of the crowd, and the roar of nine aircraft in the high sky shook the Chengdu Plain. Representatives of all ethnic groups and sectors of society in the Western Sichuan Region and Chengdu City sitting in the train waved goodbye to the cheering crowd outside the window, taking the train to Chongqing for the first time. The "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Victory Memorial Monument" also held a groundbreaking ceremony on the square on the same day. The monument was established by the people of the Southwest to commemorate the great contributions of workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government.

He said: The successful completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway demonstrates the great power of the Chinese working people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. It broke the national inferiority complex. Since we can complete such arduous projects as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the harnessing of the Huai River, and the Jingjiang River flood diversion under difficult conditions, then in the future, when various conditions have been greatly improved, our country's construction undertakings will surely advance by leaps and bounds.

Zhong Tigan, Deputy Director of the Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office, Li Zonglin, Mayor of Chengdu, Li Jieren, Deputy Mayor, Peng Dixian, representative of democratic parties, Huang Xianzhang, professor at Sichuan University, and Xie Jiaquan, a model road construction worker, also gave lively speeches at the meeting.

People are so excited that they cannot sleep. Since the evening of June 30, people of all kinds have been constantly pouring into the square. Women cadres and female students are wearing brightly colored dresses, and ethnic minorities from the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and the deep mountains of northwestern Sichuan are wearing colorful costumes of various ethnic groups. Some farmers have come from hundreds of miles away to attend the conference. The beautiful city of Chengdu has been boiling with the joy of the masses from night to day. After the meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM, 300,000 people marched into the city along the main streets, and a grand fireworks display was held at night.
