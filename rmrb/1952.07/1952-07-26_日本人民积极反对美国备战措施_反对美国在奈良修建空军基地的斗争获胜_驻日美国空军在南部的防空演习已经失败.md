Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Tokyo News: The struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. building an air force base near the ancient capital of Nara has been victorious.

When the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee initially decided that the U.S. would build an air force base near Nara, the people of Nara, in order to protect the local precious cultural relics and historical sites, launched a movement to protect cultural heritage and resolutely protested this decision. Because of this, when a senator questioned Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki at a meeting of the Committee on Education of the Japanese Senate on the 22nd, Okazaki was forced to state: "It has now been decided not to build an air force base in Nara."

Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: Tokyo News: The failure of the air defense exercise recently conducted by the U.S. Air Force in Japan once again powerfully illustrates the increasingly strong opposition of the Japanese people to the U.S.'s war preparations in Japan.

In order to step up war preparations and create a war atmosphere, the U.S. Air Force authorities in Japan held a three-day air defense exercise nationwide in Japan starting on July 21. In advance, the U.S. occupiers instructed the Japanese authorities to require Japanese residents to provide "assistance" and "cooperation" to the air defense exercise. Nevertheless, the Japanese people expressed their protests against the air defense exercise as soon as the news was announced, and they used practical actions to oppose it when the exercise was implemented.

The focus of the first day of the U.S. military's air defense exercise was southern Japan. On this very day, the people of Fukuoka City, the central city of southern Japan, showed strong resistance to the air defense exercise. Students from Kyushu University held demonstrations against the blackout. They gave speeches to the masses, condemning the blackout as a war preparation, and called on residents and shops to protest the blackout by keeping their lights on. According to Kyodo News Agency, after the authorities issued an alarm and announced the implementation of the blackout, students at Kyushu University held a bonfire on campus, expressing their "contempt for the air defense exercise." "In the entertainment area of downtown Fukuoka, there was no sign of a blackout. During the entire blackout period, the neon lights of hotels, pinball parlors, movie theaters, and restaurants remained brightly lit." Among the citizens, the alarm "did not receive a quick response." Some households delayed for some time before being forced to turn off the lights, "apparently very unwillingly."

Under these circumstances, Kyodo News Agency admitted: The U.S. Air Force authorities originally hoped that the Japanese would participate in the air defense exercise, "but because many Japanese are unwilling to cooperate, this exercise has failed."

Xinhua News Agency: TASS Tokyo, July 24th: The "Asahi Shimbun" said: The U.S.-Japan Joint Committee will sign an agreement on July 26 regarding the transfer of Japanese bases and equipment to the U.S. military. The newspaper also published a letter from a reader in Chiba Prefecture, in which they said: Due to the strict prohibition of fishing in Tokyo Bay, 300 fishing households in Futtsu and Yasuda (transliteration) have gone bankrupt as a result.

    日本人民积极反对美国备战措施
    反对美国在奈良修建空军基地的斗争获胜
    驻日美国空军在南部的防空演习已经失败
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美国在日本故都奈良附近建筑空军基地的斗争，已经获得胜利。
    当美日联合委员会初步决定美国将在奈良附近建筑一个空军基地时，奈良人民为了保护当地的珍贵的文物古迹，曾展开了一个保卫文化遗产的运动，坚决抗议这个决定。由于这样，一个参议员二十二日在日本参议院文部委员会会议上向外务相冈崎胜男提出质询时，冈崎被迫表示：“现在已决定不在奈良建筑空军基地。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：日前驻日美国空军所举行的防空演习的失败，再次有力地说明日本人民愈来愈强烈地反对美国在日本的备战措施。
    驻日美国空军当局为了加紧备战措施和制造战争气氛，从七月二十一日起在日本全国范围内举行防空演习三天。事前，美国占领者即指令日本当局要求日本居民对防空演习予以“协助”和“合作”。尽管如此，日本人民对于防空演习在消息宣布之初就纷纷表示抗议，而在演习实行时，更用实际行动来反对。
    美军防空演习第一天的重点是日本南部。就在这
    一天，日本南部的中心城市福冈市的人民，对防空演习表现了强烈的对抗情绪。九州大学的学生举行示威游行，反对灯火管制。他们向群众发表演说，谴责灯火管制是战争准备，并号召居民和商店抗议灯火管制，开着电灯。据共同社消息，入夜，在当局发出警报，宣布实行灯火管制之后，九州大学学生在校园内举行了营火会，表示了“对防空演习的藐视”。“在福冈市中心的娱乐区域区，丝毫没有灯火管制的迹象，在整个灯火管制的时间，各酒店、弹子房、电影院与饮食店的霓虹灯仍然照耀通明。”在市民中间，警报也“没有得到很快的反应”。有些住户拖延了一些时间才被迫把灯火关掉，“显然很不情愿的样子”。
    在这种情况下，共同社承认：美国空军当局原来希望日本人参加防空演习，“但因许多日本人都不愿合作，这种演习已经失败”。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社东京二十四日电：“朝日新闻”说：美日联合委员会将于七月二十六日签订一个关于将日本基地和设备移交美军的协定。该报并登载了千叶县读者来信，他们在信中说：由于严禁在东京湾捕鱼，富津和安田（译音）的三百家渔户都因此破产。
