The cities and villages on the Subei Plain are prospering day by day. This is because the two fierce dragons, the Huai River and the Yi River, which have caused the people of Subei to flee famine year after year for centuries, have been tamed. Now, these two rivers are flowing quietly in the irrigation canals, in the riverbeds, and resting in Hongze Lake, Gaobao Lake, and Luoma Lake, tamely awaiting the orders of their masters – the working people.

At the end of June, the Gaoliangjian water intake gate on the shore of Hongze Lake was completed, and the irrigation canal was opened. The Huai River, which has threatened the people of Subei for many years, now passes through the intake gate, flows into the West Main Canal (i.e., the Grand Canal), crosses the more than one hundred culverts and gates on the Grand Canal embankment, and follows many small rivers east of the Grand Canal, irrigating five million mu of rice fields on the east bank of the Grand Canal. In the past, these rice fields were either flooded in wet years or unable to be planted in dry years. Today, people only need to use waterwheels to draw water from the river into the rice fields. In many other places, as long as the head gates of the canals are opened regularly, the water will naturally flow from the lotus-filled ponds and ditches into the lush green rice fields.

In the Yi River basin, people are also trying to convert five million mu of dry land into paddy fields. Wang Daqiao, a special-class meritorious worker in guiding the Yi River who lives on the banks of the Yi River, is taking the lead in carrying river water to irrigate the corn and sorghum in the fields with the strength he used to dig eighty catties of mud with one shovel when he was digging the river, striving to increase production through drought resistance.

This is the happy life created by the people of Subei with their own labor.

In the past, hundreds of millions of people living in the lower reaches of these two rivers, every summer and autumn, as soon as lightning flashed in the sky, watched the rolling yellow water engulf the crops and destroy their homes. Ripe wheat was sometimes swept away by the water before it could be harvested, and autumn grain could not be planted. Everyone could only leave with tears in their eyes and flee the famine. But now, it is completely different. As soon as you enter the villages in this area, you will see that every house is piled high with new wheat, and the wheat straw is piled up on the threshing grounds like small mountains.

The Huaiyin area in the Yi River basin produced only more than 800 million catties of grain in the whole year before the Yi River was guided and harnessed in 1949. By the second year of guiding the Yi River in 1951, the whole year was a bumper harvest, and the wheat season alone yielded more than 800 million catties. This year, with the completion of all the flood control projects, and the launch of the patriotic production increase competition of ten thousand groups and thousands of villages, the wheat harvest was more than 100 million catties higher than last year. Many low-lying areas that used to yield nothing in nine years out of ten also had good harvests this year. Huaian County, which straddles both sides of the irrigation canal, used to have many low-lying areas where reeds grew, but this year they are all growing good wheat that is shoulder-high. The county produced 80 million catties of wheat last year and 130 million catties this year, an increase of more than 60 percent. Wang Daqiao, Zhu Fangren, and other mutual aid teams in Shuyang County, and many high-yielding farm households on the shores of Qingyi Lake, have achieved high yields of more than 500 catties of wheat per mu. Now, both sides of the Xin Yi River and the irrigation canal are immersed in a sea of bumper harvest joy.

The farmers hailed this bumper harvest as a "complete turnaround"! In the past, July and August were the time when every household "had no smoke coming from the chimney and lived on tree bark and grass roots." Last year, thanks to the bumper harvest, everyone was no longer starving. But life was not yet good, and production tools were not yet complete. The farmers said:

"That was a half turnaround!" But this year's wheat harvest alone is enough for many families to have enough food for a year or most of the year, and some even have surplus grain. Farmers are adding new houses and purchasing ploughing cattle and farm implements. When reporters visited the Huai'an County Huai River Harnessing Model Xu Shouyong Mutual Aid Team, he led us to the newly built house and showed us the newly bought strong horses, steers, and fat pigs. His team member Xu Changhai said humorously: "In the past, the only four-legged thing in our team was a small stool that could not walk, but now we have a horse, two cattle, and thirteen pigs. These are all good guys who can eat, work, and make fertilizer!"

Farmers who could not even afford salt in the past now need a lot of oil and sugar. The demand for cloth this year has increased eighteen times compared to the same period last year. And 70 percent of them want good ones. All kinds of exquisite colored cloths, Shilin, twill, and dragon head fine cloths are made into new clothes and knitted goods, replacing everyone's tattered old clothes. And fashionable young people are also changing into beautiful shirts.

"Once you have enough to eat, you want to learn to read!" The "completely turned around" farmers are very active in cultural learning. In 1949, there were only more than 12,000 children enrolled in Lianshui County. Teachers went to the homes to mobilize, and the parents said: "Literacy cannot be eaten!" But now no one says that anymore. There are currently more than 65,000 children enrolled in the county. During the famine in Zhuzhuang Township, Shuyang County, there was no primary school; now there are five primary schools with nearly 500 students. Many farmers eagerly hope that their children will receive education, but the school places have long been exceeded, so they ask the most decent people to intercede with the teachers. When Ma Qizhi from Wangchang Village, Yuling Township, Shuyang County sent his son to school, he said:

"Study hard, and learn to drive a tractor in the future!" This shows their sincere and deep hope. During this hot and humid lunch break, thousands of farmers take advantage of the rest opportunity, carrying books and newspapers, to study in civil schools.

The bumper harvest of agricultural products has also brought prosperity to all the cities in the two river basins. According to the report of the Huaiyin branch of the China Grain Company: the daily amount of wheat on the market in the Huaiyin area now reaches about four million catties. Zhongxing Town in Siyang County purchased as much as 500,000 catties on the most day. This shows how rapidly the purchasing power of farmers is increasing. Taking Huaiyin City, which is located between the irrigation canal and the Xin Yi River, as an example, today it presents a scene of "wheat bumper harvest and prosperity in all industries." The state-owned trading company and many private shops are crowded with customers from the countryside all day long. They throw out the new wheat they brought and buy back the supplies they need and love. Thousands of large ships shuttle back and forth day and night to the lower reaches of the river, carrying out grain and loading a large number of industrial products. The turnover of general stores is more than six times higher than two years ago. The monthly turnover of the city's iron industry production cooperative is more than 100 million yuan, while in 1949, the monthly turnover was only more than 1 million yuan, and in 1950, the annual turnover was only more than 100 million yuan. Due to the large sales volume, state-owned trading companies are pursuing the creation of procurement budgets, and many private businesses are planning to increase their capital. In June, more than 40 households applied to the people's government to open shops and factories.

Every working people understands that this harvest and happy days are "given to us by Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led us to remove the two mountains on our heads (referring to imperialism and feudal landlords) and subdue these two fierce dragons! And forced them to serve us." Now people are putting themselves into the tense production labor of autumn crops with unparalleled enthusiasm. They are working hard to strive for greater harvests and greater happiness!

    治淮导沂后的苏北平原
    新华社记者  孙振林  牧向阳
    苏北平原上的城市和乡村一天一天地繁荣起来了，这是因为几百年来，害得苏北人民年年逃荒的两条凶龙——淮河和沂河都治好了。现在这两条河水，都静静地在灌溉总渠里流着，在河床里流着，在洪泽湖、高宝湖、骆马湖里停息着，驯服地等待它们的主人——劳动人民的使唤。
    六月底，洪泽湖畔高良涧进水闸落成，灌溉总渠放水了。多年威胁着苏北人民的淮河，今天穿过进水闸，流进西干渠（即运河），再越过运河大堤上一百多个涵闸，顺着运河以东的很多小河，灌溉着运河东岸五百万亩秧田。过去这一片秧田水年浸在水里，旱年无法插秧。今天人们只要用水车，就可以把河水源源地汲进秧田里了。还有许多地方，只要定时地开放渠首闸，水就自然从荷花盛开的塘沟里，流进碧绿的秧田。
    沂河流域，人们也正在设法将五百万亩旱田改成水田。住在沂河边上的导沂特等功臣王大锹，正以他扒河时一锹挖泥八十斤的力量，第一个开始担河水浇灌田里的玉米、高粱，争取抗旱增产。
    这是苏北人民用自己劳动创造出来的幸福生活。
    过去，居住在这两河下游的千百万人民，每到夏秋两季，只要天边一闪电，眼望着滚滚的黄水，就淹没了庄稼，毁坏了家园。成熟的麦子，有时来不及收割，就随水流去，秋粮也无法下地。个个都只有含着眼泪，出外逃荒。但是，现在完全不同了。你一走进这一带的村庄，就会看到家家屋里堆满了新麦，场上麦秸像小山似地堆着。
    沂河流域的淮阴专区，一九四九年导治沂河之前，全年只产八亿多斤粮食。到了一九五一年导沂的第二年，全年丰收，单麦季就收了八亿多斤。今年防洪工程全部完成，同时又开展了万组千村爱国丰产竞赛，麦子比去年更多收了一亿多斤。过去许多十年九不收的洼地，今年也都是好收成。横跨灌溉总渠两岸的淮安县，往年很多生长芦荻的低地，今年都长了高齐人肩的好麦。该县去年产麦八千万斤，今年产一亿三千万斤，增产百分之六十以上。沭阳县的王大锹、朱方仁等互助组和青伊湖畔的好些丰产农家，更出现了每亩产小麦五百斤以上的高额产量。现在新沂河和灌溉总渠两岸，到处沉浸在丰收欢腾的海里。
    农民欢呼这个丰收为“全翻身”！过去，七、八月间，正是家家“烟囱不冒烟，树皮草根挨日子”的时候。去年由于丰收，大家已不再饿肚皮了。但是生活还不算好，生产工具还不周全。农民说：
    “那是半翻身！”而今年一季麦收，许多人家已够一年或大半年的口粮，有的还有余粮。农民增盖房屋，添置耕牛、农具。记者到淮安县治淮模范许寿永互助组去访问时，他带领我们到新砌的屋里，参观了新买的壮马、犍牛和肥猪。他的组员许长海幽默地说：“过去我们组里四只脚的东西，只有不会走路的小板凳，可是现在我们已经有了一匹马，两头牛，十三只猪子。这些都是能吃能做能造肥料的好家伙啊！”
    过去连盐都吃不上嘴的农民，现在却需要大量的油脂和糖。布匹的需要量，今年上半年就比去年同期增加了十八倍。而且百分之七十要好的。各色精致的色布、士林、斜纹、龙头细布做成的新衣和针织品，替换了每人破烂不堪的旧衣。而时新的年青人，还改着了漂亮的衬衫。
    “吃饱了肚皮就要识字！”“全翻身”的农民对文化学习都很积极。一九四九年涟水县只有一万二千多儿童入学。教师到各家动员，家长都说：“识字不能当饭吃！”可是现在谁也不这么说了，该县目前入学儿童已达六万五千多名。沭阳县朱庄乡灾荒时，没有一所小学；现在已有小学五所，近五百名学生。很多农民迫切盼望自己的子弟受到教育，但学校的名额早已超过，就请最体面的人向教师说情。沭阳县淤岭乡王场村马启志送儿子上学时说：
    “好好读书，将来学开拖拉机呀！”这表现了他们真挚深切的希望。在这溽暑歇午的时候，成千上万的农民，便利用休息机会，挟着书报，到民校里去学习。
    农产丰收又带来了两河流域所有城市的繁荣。据中国粮食公司淮阴支公司报告：现在淮阴专区小麦每天上市量达四百万斤左右。泗阳县众兴镇最多的
    一天收购了五十万斤。这说明农民的购买力是何等飞快地在提高着。以灌溉总渠和新沂河之间的淮阴城为例，今天到处呈现“小麦丰收百业兴”的景象。国营贸易公司和许多私营商店门口，成天拥满来自乡村的顾客。他们把带来的新麦抛出、买回所需要和所喜爱的用品。成千只大船，夜以继日地往来河下，他们运出粮食、装进大量的工业品。眼前
    一般商店营业额都比两年前增加六倍以上。该市铁业生产合作社，每月营业额达一亿多元，而一九四九年一个月的营业额只有一百多万元，一九五○年全年只一亿多元。由于销货量大，国营贸易公司都在追造进货预算，许多私营商号都在筹增资金。六月份有四十多户向人民政府申请开店设厂。
    这丰收幸福的日子，每个劳动人民都明白：“这是毛主席给我们的！”“毛主席和共产党领导我们搬掉了压在我们头上的两座大山，（指帝国主义和封建地主）又降服了这两条凶龙！并迫使它们为我们服务了。”现在人们正以无比的热情，投入紧张的秋季作物的生产劳动中。他们正为着争取更大的丰收和更大的幸福而努力！
