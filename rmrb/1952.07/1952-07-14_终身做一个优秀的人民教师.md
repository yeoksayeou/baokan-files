    Dedicate Your Life to Being an Excellent People's Teacher
    Comrade Editor: Our country's unprecedented large-scale economic construction is about to begin. How glorious and happy it is for us to be born in such a great country! Let us think about it: continuous construction will fill the country with factories and schools. At that time, there will be no more illiterates.
    We are normal school students who are about to step into our work posts, a cultural army in the construction of the motherland. Let us tell you that under the education of the Party for the past three years, we have become strong and brave. We have established a revolutionary worldview, consolidated our professional thinking, and through internships and visits, we have further deepened our love for the people's education cause both ideologically and emotionally. On the eve of celebrating the Party's birthday, we, 138 students, made a solemn oath to the Party: to dedicate our lives to being excellent people's teachers.
    Just as we were preparing to step onto the glorious educational posts, we received a letter of challenge from the graduating students of Xingtai Normal School in Hebei Province. We immediately launched a heated discussion with a serious and earnest attitude and an excited mood. What made us even happier was that, while we were writing this letter, we received another letter from the graduating students of Hebei Normal College, expressing their determination to serve the people. This really made us feel that millions of young people in the motherland all have one aspiration, which is for the construction of the motherland. We have decided that not only will we accept the challenge from the graduating students of Xingtai Normal School, but we will also challenge all the graduating normal school students in the country. At the same time, we wrote to our beloved Chairman Mao, expressing our determination to serve the motherland.
    Our challenge conditions are: First, regardless of personal treatment, work location, or work nature, we will resolutely and unconditionally obey the organization's assignment and ensure that we happily take up the work posts needed by the motherland. Second, we will persist in studying every day at work, combining ideology and professional skills, and study *On Contradiction*, *On Practice*, and *Education* (Volume 1), ensuring that we complete our studies before our school's anniversary day (March 15th) in 1953. In the process of teaching practice, we will continuously train and improve ourselves, and strive to become outstanding teachers of the people within three years. Third, we will continuously overcome individualistic thinking at work, rely on leadership, work actively, conduct investigations and research, be bold in innovation, not be arrogant, not be discouraged, and humbly learn from the masses. Fourth, we will stand firm, adhere to principles, and wage a resolute struggle against all phenomena that endanger the interests of the people.
    Our challenge conditions are our action program for the future and the yardstick for checking whether each of us is loyal to the motherland. Therefore, we have decided to summarize the results of our implementation of these conditions at the alumni association on our school's anniversary day every year, and report our work to the motherland.
    Dear students: work hard! We are all creators of new life, engineers of the human soul. In order to welcome the upcoming high tide of cultural construction, and for a happy tomorrow, let us always fight strongly on the cultural and educational front of the motherland.

    终身做一个优秀的人民教师
    编辑同志：祖国空前的大规模的经济建设就要开始了，我们生长在这样伟大的国度里，是多么光荣，多么高兴啊！让我们想想吧，不断的建设，将使祖国遍地布满了工厂、学校，那时将再也找不到一个文盲了。
    我们是即将走上工作岗位的师范生，是祖国建设中的一批文化大军，让我们告诉你吧，三年来在党的教育下，我们变得坚强、勇敢了，我们确立了革命人生观，巩固了专业思想，通过实习、参观，我们进一步从思想上、感情上热爱人民教育事业。在庆祝党的生日的前夕，我们一百三十八个同学，向党发出了庄严的誓言：要终身做一个优秀的人民教师。
    正当我们准备走上光荣的教育岗位的时候，我们接到了河北省邢台师范学校毕业同学的挑战书，我们立即以严肃认真的态度和兴奋的心情，展开了热烈的讨论。更使我们高兴的是，在我们写这封信的同时，又接到了河北师范学院毕业同学的来信，他们表示了为人民服务的决心。这真使我们感到：祖国千百万青年都是怀着一个心愿，那便是为了祖国的建设事业。我们决定了：不但要向邢台师范学校毕业同学应战，还要向祖国全体即将毕业的师范学校同学挑战。同时我们上书给我们敬爱的毛主席，表示我们为祖国服务的决心。
    我们的挑战条件是：一、不论个人待遇、工作地点、工作性质，坚决无条件地服从组织分配，保证愉快地走上祖国需要的工作岗位。二、在工作中每天坚持学习，结合思想和业务，学习矛盾论、实践论、教育学（上册），保证在一九五三年我校校庆日（三月十五日）以前学完。在教学实践过程中，不断地锻炼和提高自己，争取三年内成为人民的优秀教师。三、在工作中不断克服个人主义思想，依靠领导，积极工作，调查研究，大胆创造，不骄傲，不灰心，虚心向群众学习。四、在工作中站稳立场，坚持原则，和一切危害人民利益的现象作坚决的斗争。
    我们的挑战条件，就是我们今后的行动纲领，和检查我们每个人是否忠于祖国的准绳。因此，我们决定在每年我校校庆日的校友会上，总结我们执行这些条件的结果，向祖国汇报我们的工作。
    亲爱的同学们：努力吧！我们都是新生活的创造者、人类灵魂的工程师，让我们为了迎接即将到来的文化建设高潮，为了幸福的明天，永远坚强地战斗在祖国的文化教育战线上。
    北京师范学校毕业班同学
