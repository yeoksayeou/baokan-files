    Beijing's Several Crash Literacy Classes' Experiences in Intensive Learning of New Characters Using "Phonetic Vocabulary Lists"
    Tuguang
    Recently, many crash literacy classes in Beijing have been using "phonetic vocabulary lists" to teach adults to intensively learn new characters. Current experience proves that it is superior to "phonetic single character lists."
    The so-called vocabulary list, which is a list of new characters composed of vocabulary words, is first welcomed by the majority of teachers. They unanimously report that vocabulary lists are easier to teach and prepare lessons for. Teachers don't even need to explain many words, and students can understand them. Even if the words are slightly more complex, because the vocabulary itself is commonly used in adults' daily lives, with pronunciation revealing the meaning, it is easy for teachers to explain. For example, for words like "labor," "glory," and "unity," the teacher only needs to give examples such as "everyone should labor," "military families are truly glorious," "everyone should unite"..., and the students will immediately understand. If these characters are changed to single characters for intensive learning, it will be more difficult. Teachers with a high level of proficiency often explain a character with several meanings when teaching using character lists, such as explaining the character "模" (mó) as the "模" in "model," "worthy of emulation," and "airplane model," which makes students feel difficult to remember. Teachers with a lower level of proficiency have to look up the dictionary or consult with more advanced tutors when encountering a character, which results in wasted time and very rigid teaching. Some teachers, in order to master a character, only explain one meaning, not knowing which one to explain, and often become passive and helpless during class. There are also some characters that do not have a separate meaning in spoken language, such as "模" (mó) and "范" (fàn). If they are taught separately, the teacher can only explain them as the "模" in "model" and the "范" in "model". The teaching time is uneconomical, and it is difficult for the learners to remember. Some teachers, based on their teaching experience, believe that it takes only 40 hours (including review time) to teach 1,800 new characters when teaching vocabulary lists; it takes 60 hours (including review time) to teach character lists. If 90 characters are crammed into each hour, it takes only 20 minutes to teach using vocabulary lists with ease; it takes 30 minutes using character lists. This fully demonstrates that the teaching efficiency when using vocabulary lists is much higher than when using character lists.
    Phonetic vocabulary lists are not only welcomed by teachers but also by the majority of students. They all feel that vocabulary lists are easy to understand, easy to remember, convenient to review, and useful after learning. For example, students in Groups 3 and 11 of the No. 2 class of the Furen University Adult Night School said: Vocabulary lists are really easy to read, "拉手 (lā shǒu, hold hands)," "走路 (zǒu lù, walk)," "念书 (niàn shū, study)," "写字 (xiě zì, write)," "说话 (shuō huà, speak)," "开会 (kāi huì, hold a meeting)"..., they understand as soon as they spell them out. Students in the Gaobeidian Crash Literacy Class reflected: "When intensively studying vocabulary lists, the teacher taught 80 characters a day, and we didn't feel tired and remembered them all. But when intensively studying single character lists, we were exhausted and sweating profusely even after learning 70 characters a day." A student at the No. 7 Cultural Center once said when intensively studying vocabulary lists: "When I received a letter and opened it, I saw that the words in the letter were almost all in the vocabulary list, and I understood the meaning of the letter as soon as I read it." A student named Fan Shumin originally only knew 110 characters. After just finishing intensively studying the fourth volume of vocabulary lists, she was able to read the blackboard newspaper. She said: "I really didn't expect that I could read the blackboard newspaper after only studying for a few days." The reason is that she had already learned the six words in the vocabulary list that were written on the blackboard newspaper: "彻底交代清楚，才能轻松愉快 (chè dǐ jiāo dài qīng chǔ, cái néng qīng sōng yú kuài, thoroughly explain clearly to be relaxed and happy)". At the same time, the vocabulary list further solved the problem of the four tones. For example, for the character "气 (qì)" in "空气 (kōng qì, air)," if the four tones are not marked when using single character lists to teach, students will not know whether to read it as "欺 (qī)" or "奇 (qí)" when spelling "く一". This shortcoming can be avoided by using vocabulary lists to teach. The above examples show that vocabulary lists are suitable for the spoken language of the masses, and students can easily accept them. Therefore, they are much superior to single character lists.
    However, phonetic vocabulary lists also have shortcomings. Using vocabulary lists to intensively study new characters sometimes leads to tongue twisters and the inability to "move" (apply the knowledge to new contexts). For example, some characters with the same rhyme are easily confused: such as reading "光 (guāng, light)" as "堂 (táng, hall)"; characters with similar shapes are easily confused, such as reading "轻 (qīng, light)" as "经 (jīng, through)", reading "虚 (xū, empty)" as "处 (chù, place)", reading "院 (yuàn, courtyard)" as "完 (wán, complete)", and reading "广 (guǎng, wide)" as "黄 (huáng, yellow)"; some characters with the same meaning are also easily confused, such as reading "路 (lù, road)" as "街 (jiē, street)". In addition, some read "广大平原上 (guǎng dà píng yuán shàng, on the vast plains)" as "伟大平原上 (wěi dà píng yuán shàng, on the great plains)"; and read "吃穿都不愁 (chī chuān dōu bù chóu, not worried about food and clothing)" as "吃饭都不愁 (chī fàn dōu bù chóu, not worried about eating)" and so on.
    To overcome these shortcomings, we can take many effective measures.
    First, when editing vocabulary lists, pay attention to the consistency of the order in which new characters appear on the vocabulary list and the order in which new characters appear in the reading textbook, and the consistency of the words on the vocabulary list and the words in the textbook. This will not only reduce the difficulty of reading but also make it easier to search for characters. Some units have disrupted the original order in which new characters appear in the textbook in the vocabulary list, and the students have all responded that "this method is not good". If the teacher wants to make it easier to compile the vocabulary list, they can move the new characters from the next volume to the front, but they must not put the new characters from the previous volume at the bottom. It is best to find some other characters to add in, and do not disrupt the original order. In addition to compiling vocabulary lists, some units have also compiled "radical" character lists, "homophone" character lists, and "review" character lists. Review character lists are edited by volume and arranged according to the number of strokes, which is convenient for reviewing after intensively studying the vocabulary. Radical character lists are for copying, and homophone character lists are for writing, but these two methods can be used to teach students to distinguish the shapes of characters when intensively studying vocabulary.
    Second, when intensively studying vocabulary lists, students generally use the following methods to remember characters: using phonetic symbols to remember characters, using "earth crutches" to remember characters (such as drawing a house next to a house, and drawing a dragon next to a dragon), distinguishing the shapes of characters (such as comparing characters with similar shapes, such as 专传傅转 (zhuān chuán fù zhuǎn), 远达建逮 (yuǎn dá jiàn dài) etc.), associating character meanings (such as the character "补 (bǔ, to mend)", women often remember it as "补衣服 (bǔ yī fu, mending clothes)"), remembering characters with words (that is, associating a character from above with a character from below), and not remembering characters according to their original positions on the vocabulary list. Teachers can adopt different attitudes towards the above six character remembering methods. Phonetic pinyin can be used at the beginning, but when intensively studying six or seven hundred characters, it can be used while also using other methods to help students remember characters. As for the methods of distinguishing character shapes and associating character meanings, because students already have a basis for recognizing hundreds of characters at this time, they can use familiar characters to remember new characters. Teachers can take a laissez-faire attitude towards "earth crutches" because they can help students' memory to a certain extent. As for methods such as "remembering characters with words" and "guessing characters based on their original positions on the vocabulary list," efforts must be made to discard them. The methods of distinguishing character shapes and associating character meanings can be developed.
    Third, strengthening review is a good way to enable students to "move" (apply the knowledge to new contexts) and avoid tongue twisters. So, what methods can be used for review? Generally, a review method from words to characters can be adopted: When teachers guide students to review, they do not read in the original order of the vocabulary list, but adopt methods of reading directly and horizontally, reading forward and backward, reading in a roundabout way, and reading by randomly pointing; use a review ruler to let students identify characters (the ruler has several holes, which can cover up the phonetic pinyin symbols on one hand and cover up the characters above to ask him to identify them on the other); review "word numbers" and "character numbers," that is, cut the words apart, and after reviewing them well, cut them into characters again to practice "moving" (applying the knowledge to new contexts); eliminate troublemaking characters, and concentrate the difficult-to-remember characters together to "eliminate" them; after intensively studying the "vocabulary list" of a textbook, compile another character list for review; read in sections, that is, after intensively studying one or two vocabulary lists, read one or two textbooks.
    According to our experience, if the review work of the vocabulary list can be done well, the effect will be much greater than that of the character list. Because after using many methods for review, students' recognition of characters has been largely consolidated.

    北京市几个速成识字班用“注音词表”突击学习生字的经验
    土光
    北京市最近有很多速成识字班采用“注音词表”教成人突击学习生字。现有经验证明，它比“注音单字表”要来得优越。
    所谓词表，是用词汇组成的生字表，它首先受到广大教师的欢迎。他们一致反映词表好讲，备课容易。很多词，教员不用讲，学生就领会了。即使稍深一点，因为词汇本身是成人日常生活中常用的，读音生义，老师讲起来也就容易。如“劳动”、“光荣”、“团结”等词，教师只要举例说“人人要劳动”、“军属真光荣”、“大家要团结”……，学员马上就懂。如果把这些字改成单字来突击学习，就比较困难。程度高的教师，在用字表教学时往往把一个字讲成几个意思，如把“模”字解释为“模范”、“足为楷模”、“飞机模型”等的“模”，这样就使同学感觉到难于记忆。程度低的教师碰到一个字，不是要查字典，就是要请教程度高的辅导员，结果是浪费了时间，教学时也非常呆板。有些老师为了掌握一个字只讲一个字义，不知道讲那一个好，到上课时往往形成被动、没办法。还有些字在口语中没有单独的意义，如“模”和“范”，假使把它们分开讲，教师就只好解释成“模范”的“模”、“模范”的“范”。教学时间既不经济，学的人也不好记忆。有些教员根据自己的教学经验，认为：教词表时，一千八百个生字，只要四十小时（包括复习时间）就可教完；教字表就需六十个小时（包括复习时间）。如果每小时突击九十个字，用词表只需二十分钟就可从从容容地教完；用字表就得三十分钟。这充分地说明了应用词表时的教学效率比应用字表要高得多。
    注音词表不仅受到教师们的欢迎，同时也受到广大学员的欢迎。他们都觉得词表好懂好记、复习方便，学了有用。如辅仁大学成人夜校二班三组和十一组的同学都说：词表真是好念，“拉手”、“走路”、“念书”、“写字”、“说话”、“开会”……等，一拼就懂。高碑店速成识字班的学员反映：“突击词表时，一天老师教八十个字，不觉得费力就都记住了。但在突击单字表时，一天学七十个还累得满头大汗。”第七文化馆的一个学员在突击词表时曾说过：“我接到一封信，打开一看，信里的话，差不多词表里都有，一念就明白了信的意思。”有个叫樊淑敏的学员原来只认识一百一十个字，在刚突击完第四册词表的时候，就能看黑板报。她说：“我真想不到，刚念几天书，就能看黑板报。”原因是黑板报上所写的“彻底交代清楚，才能轻松愉快”中的六个词，她在词表中都已学过。词表同时又进一步解决了四声问题。如“空气”的“气”字，在采用单字表教学时，如不注四声，学生在拼“く一”时，就不知道是读“欺”音，还是“奇”音，用词表教学就可避免这个缺点。上述这些例子说明词表适合群众的口语，学员容易接受，因此它比单字表要优越得很多。
    但是，注音词表也有缺点，用词表突击生字，有时产生顺口溜和不能“搬家”的现象。如有些同韵字容易混淆：如把“光”读成“堂”；形状近似的字容易混淆起来，如把“轻”读成“经”，把“虚”读成“处”，把“院”读成“完”，把“广”读成
    “黄”；有些字义相同的字也容易混淆不清，如把“路”读成“街”。此外，有的把“广大平原上”读成“伟大平原上”；把“吃穿都不愁”读成“吃饭都不愁”等等。
    为了克服这些缺点，我们可以采取很多有效的办法加以克服。
    第一，在编辑词表时，注意词表上生字出现的次序和阅读课本上生字出现次序的一致性，词表上的词和课本上的词的一致性。这样，不仅可以减少阅读中的困难，同时检字也比较容易。有些单位的词表打乱了课本原来生字出现的次序，学员都反映
    “这办法不妙”，老师要是为了编词表的方便，可以把下一册的生字提到前面；不可把上一册的生字落在下面。最好另外找些字编进去，不要打乱原来的次序。有些单位除了编词表外，还编了“部首”字表，和“同音”字表、“复习字表”等。复习字表是分册编辑，按字画多少排列，便于在突击词后进行复习。部首字表是为抄写时用，同音字表是为写作时用，但在突击词时，可用这两个方法教学生分辨字形。
    第二，在突击词表中，学生一般用下列方法记字：用注音符号记字，用土拐棍记字（如在屋旁画一所房屋，龙旁画一条龙），分辨字形（如把形状近似的字拿来比较，如专传傅转，远达建逮等），联想字义（如“补”字，妇女往往记成“补衣服”），用词记字（即从上面的一个字联想到下面的一个字），不按词表上的原来地位记字。对待上述六种记字方法，教师们可以采取不同的态度。注音拼音，在开始时是可以利用的，待突击六七百字时，就可以一面用它，一面又用别的办法帮助学员记字。关于分辨字形和联想字义的办法，因为这时学员已有认识几百字的基础，可以利用熟字记生字了。教员们对于土拐棍可采取让它自生自灭的态度，因为它在一定程度上能帮助学员的记忆。至于“用词记字”、“按词表上原来地位猜字”等办法，必须设法加以抛弃。分辨字形与联想字义的方法，可以发挥。
    第三，加强复习是使学员善于“搬家”、避免顺口溜现象的好办法。那末，采用什么方法进行复习呢？一般可以采用由词到字的复习办法：教师启发学生复习时，不按词表原来的排列顺序读，采用直念和横念，顺念和倒念，拐弯念和乱点着念的办法；采用复习尺，让学生辨认字（尺中留数孔，一方面盖住注音拼音符号，一方面盖住上面的一个字叫他辨认）；复习“词号”“字号”，即把词剪开，复习好后，再剪成字练习“搬家”；消灭捣蛋字，把难记的字集中在一起加以“消灭”；把一本课本的“词表”突击完后，另编字表复习；分段阅读，即突击完一两本词表，就阅读一两本课本。
    根据我们的经验，如果能把词表的复习工作搞好，其效果要比字表大得多。因为采用了很多办法进行复习之后，学员对字的认识大体上已巩固起来了。
