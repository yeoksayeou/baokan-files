Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Education has made specific regulations regarding the dates of the national higher education entrance examinations, examination subjects, examination application preferences, and the establishment of examination districts.

    Regarding the examination dates for high school graduates and youths of equivalent high school graduation level, the national unified date is stipulated as August 15th to 18th. The start and end dates for registration will be determined separately by the admissions committees of each region based on local conditions.

    The examination subjects are: Political Common Sense, Chinese Language, Foreign Language (Russian or English), Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. (Those applying for sports, music, fine arts, and other departments may be required to take additional practical exams.) To meet the different requirements of various departments, admission standards will be stipulated with different proportions of each subject's score taken into account during grade calculation.

    Regarding the establishment of examination districts, the admissions committees of each region have been instructed to consult with the cultural and educational departments (bureaus) of each province (city) based on the distribution of candidates, and to establish as many as possible to provide full convenience for youths in small and medium-sized cities and ethnic minority areas to apply for the examinations. In this way, applying youths will not have to be concentrated in a few cities, and they can apply for national higher education institutions in their current residence or nearby areas. In order to uniformly lead the enrollment work of national higher education institutions, the Central People's Government Ministry of Education has established a National Higher Education Enrollment Committee with relevant units; the North China and Southwest regions have established regional higher education enrollment work committees respectively. The remaining regions are also actively carrying out admissions preparation work.

    With just over a month left until the examination date, high school graduates across the country are actively reviewing their courses, exercising, and preparing to welcome the higher education entrance examinations.

    中央人民政府教育部
    统一规定全国高等学校招生考试日期等
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府教育部已对高等学校招生考试日期、考试科目、考试志愿及考区设置等具体问题作了规定。
    关于高中毕业生及相当于高中毕业程度的青年考试日期全国统一规定为八月十五日至十八日。报名起迄日期另由各区招生委员会根据各地情况决定。
    考试科目为：政治常识、国文、外国文（俄文或英文）、中外史地、数学、物理、化学、生物。（投考体育、音乐、美术等类系科得加试术科。）为适合各科系的不同要求，在成绩核算时将规定各科成绩占不同比例的录取标准。
    考区设置，已指示各区招生委员会根据考生分布情况会同各省（市）文教厅（局）商订，尽可能多设，使中、小城市及少数民族地区的青年有报考的充分便利。这样投考青年就不必集中少数城市，而在他们目前居住或附近的地区就可能报考全国的高等学校。为了统一领导全国高等学校的招生工作，中央人民政府教育部已与有关单位成立了全国高等学校招生委员会；华北、西南两区已分别成立各区高等学校招生工作委员会。其余各区招生准备工作也正在积极进行中。
    现在距离考试日期只一个多月了，全国高中毕业学生正在积极温习课程，锻炼身体，准备迎接高等学校招生考试。
