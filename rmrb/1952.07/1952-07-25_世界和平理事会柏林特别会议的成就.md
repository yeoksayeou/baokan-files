    Achievements of the World Peace Council's Special Session in Berlin

    The Special Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, held in Berlin from July 1st to 6th, discussed various measures to strengthen the defense of peace at present and made corresponding resolutions. The great significance of these resolutions lies first in that it has formulated a clear program for peace fighters around the world to maintain and consolidate world peace.

    The Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin was held at a time when the US-British aggressive bloc was stepping up preparations for another world war. Recent developments in the world situation, as emphasized by Nenni in his closing remarks at the Special Session of the World Peace Council: "In recent months, aggressive militarism has crossed three stages: the San Francisco Treaty and agreements between Japan and the United States, the 'General Treaty' and attached agreements signed in Bonn on May 26 this year, and the 'European Army' treaty signed in Paris on May 27 this year. At the same time, the Korean War continues, and although armistice negotiations are underway, the situation continues to deteriorate daily. The bombing of the hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River shows that the Pentagon has not abandoned the provocative policies previously adopted by MacArthur." As Joliot-Curie said at the opening meeting of the Special Session of the World Peace Council: "It must be mentioned the most heinous chapter in human history: the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army." In this situation, people all over the world must engage in more intense and more organized struggles to eliminate the threat of imperialist aggressive war. Therefore, the resolutions of the Special Session of the World Peace Council not only express the increasingly profound desire of peace-loving people of all countries for peace, and not only aroused a unanimous and enthusiastic response from the people of all countries, but more importantly, it will and has powerfully promoted the great movement of people of all countries to strive for peace.

    The most urgent task of peace at present is to immediately stop the Korean War and restore peace in Korea as soon as possible. Therefore, the Special Session of the World Peace Council passed the "Resolution on the Question of Stopping the Korean War." This resolution pointed out that the fundamental reason why the Korean armistice negotiations have been delayed is: "The aggressive actions of the American army against China are becoming more and more frequent, thus creating a crisis of expanding the war; following the bombing of many cities in China, the use of bacteriological weapons on Chinese territory, and repeated threats to use atomic bombs, the recent bombing of power plants on the Yalu River that supply electricity to Northeast China is a deliberate provocative action aimed at making it more difficult to conclude an armistice agreement." In order to end the suffering of the Korean people and defend peace in the East and the world, the resolution finally called on all people to demand:

    "(1) Conclude an armistice agreement under the principle of respecting international law and conventions, and immediately end hostilities; whether an armistice agreement can be concluded now depends entirely on whether the US delegation abandons its unreasonable demands on the issue of prisoner repatriation.

    (2) All countries should ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of bacteriological warfare methods."

    At the same time, everyone knows that the American imperialists are frantically expanding their armaments, maintaining and deepening the division of Germany, trying every possible means to prevent Germany from restoring unity, and, against the will of the majority of the German and Japanese people, trying to revive the militarist forces of these two countries. In response to this situation, the Special Session of the World Peace Council passed the "Letter to the Governments of the Four Powers and the People of the World on the German Question" and the "Resolution on Opposing the Remilitarization of Japan and Fighting for a Democratic Japan."

    The resolution on the German question stated: "The World Peace Council believes that the best decision would be to immediately convene a conference of the four powers to pass all decisions for a peaceful solution to the German question. The World Peace Council believes that the best decision is to let the German people themselves independently realize their unification through free elections and establish a government that will conclude a peace treaty with all the countries that fought against Hitler's Germany.

    This treaty should recognize the sovereignty of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany.

    This treaty will stipulate the conditions for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces, and according to this treaty, Germany will guarantee not to participate in any military alliances. It will also help the people of European countries to be able to decide their own destiny in safety, cooperation, and respect for their independence."

     The resolution on the Japanese question stated: "In view of the threat of war expanding in Asia, the World Peace Council believes that the San Francisco Treaty and the ensuing agreements are illegal because they do not respect international agreements; a real treaty signed by all relevant countries must be signed separately.

    This treaty should stipulate:

    (A) All occupying forces should withdraw from Japan, and foreign countries shall not establish military bases in Japan.

    (B) The Japanese people have full sovereignty, and they need to develop in a democratic and peaceful atmosphere."

    Under the call of these two resolutions, the Japanese people and the German people are launching a resolute struggle to smash the war treaties imposed on them.

    The Special Session of the World Peace Council also passed the "Declaration on Convening the World People's Peace Congress." The resolution stated: "On December 5, 1952, the World People's Peace Congress will open in Vienna. Holding a wide-ranging people's vote will ensure the work of preparing for this congress in all countries. All people, men and women, regardless of opinions and beliefs, gather together to discuss and make your decisions! Elect your representatives to attend this grand event. Your desire for peace must be expressed.

    In order to achieve the goals to be determined by everyone together, the World People's Peace Congress will unite all people, regardless of their views, affiliations, or groups, as long as they hope to reduce armaments, obtain security and national independence, hope to freely choose their way of life, and hope to ease international tensions.

    The World People's Peace Congress will unite all those who hope that the spirit of consultation will prevail over the decision of force." This resolution immediately received an enthusiastic response from hundreds of millions of men and women around the world and many international mass organizations, and it has become an important slogan for action in the peace movement of various countries.

    It must be emphasized that the Special Session of the World Peace Council paid special attention to the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and China. The meeting approved the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" passed by the World Peace Council at the Oslo meeting in April this year. This document, signed by Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, loudly appealed to men and women around the world:

    "After carefully studying the documents related to the current bacteriological warfare in China and Korea, we feel anxious and shocked. Germ warfare is not only a heinous crime that should be stopped, but also a threat to all mankind. We appeal to the conscience of men and women around the world, calling on them to demand the cessation of bacteriological warfare and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. We first appeal to the men and women of the United States, because each of them is faced with a question of integrity and character. The use of the United Nations' name in the Korean War is a particularly serious situation; we believe that those governments that approve of the United Nations' intervention and are therefore morally and politically responsible for the methods used in the war should be responsible for this situation. As for us, we have a double obligation: the first is to report the situation to the public and tell the truth to everyone, so that everyone can judge the ugly facts we already know. We have decided to publish the documents we currently have, and the crimes must be exposed to the world. In order to make these crimes known to the world, the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression has suggested the establishment of an international committee that can collect all the facts. The authority and impartiality of this committee should be indisputable. To establish this committee, we invite the most prestigious representatives from the scientific, legal, and religious communities to participate. We are confident that world opinion will support the efforts of this committee. Our second obligation is to protect all people from the scourge of bacteriological warfare. We believe that only the United States, the only major power that has not ratified the international convention of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons. We call on people all over the world to put pressure on their governments so that all countries without exception sign, ratify, and abide by this convention. At the same time, we demand that strong action be taken to bring the criminals who use the most despicable, filthy, and appalling weapons to justice as war criminals. We are confident that our demand to protect the innocent and punish the criminals represents the opinion of the vast majority of people. We represent them in defending the noblest cause - the right of all children to survive and respect for humanity. If the people of all countries do not take immediate action to stop bacteriological warfare, then the cruel and violent destruction will have no end. We call on mankind to rise up and defend ourselves."

    This "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" has aroused profound repercussions in the thoughts and actions of people around the world. The fierce struggle launched by people of all countries to oppose bacteriological warfare, prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons, and demand that all countries ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons has converged into a powerful and invincible torrent; and the American aggressors, who stubbornly refuse to ratify the Geneva Protocol and openly continue to use bacteriological weapons, are not only becoming increasingly isolated, but will inevitably be justly punished by the people of the world.

    The resolutions of the Special Session of the World Peace Council greatly inspired the people of the world's victorious confidence in the struggle for peace and against war, and also defined clear goals and specific tasks for the current peace movement of the people of all countries. These resolutions, which are warmly welcomed and supported by all just humanity, are being widely disseminated among millions of men and women around the world, and this is the program of action for peace fighters around the world and the great source of their strength in their struggle.

### 世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的成就

    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的成就
    世界和平理事会常务委员会于七月一日至六日在柏林举行的特别会议，讨论了当前加强保卫和平的各项措施，并作出了相应的决议。这些决议的重大意义，首先在于它为全世界和平战士制订了维护和巩固世界和平的明确的纲领。
    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议是在美、英侵略集团加紧准备另一次世界大战的时候举行的。最近世界形势的发展，正如南尼在世界和平理事会特别会议上的闭幕辞中所强调指出的：“最近几月来，侵略性的军国主义已跨越了三个阶段：日本和美国间的旧金山条约和协定，今年五月二十六日在波恩签订的‘一般性条约’和附带的协定，以及今年五月二十七日在巴黎签订的‘欧洲军’条约。和这同时，朝鲜战争仍在继续着，虽然停战谈判正在进行，但局势仍然一天天恶化。对鸭绿江水力发电厂的轰炸说明五角大楼仍然没有放弃麦克阿瑟以前所采取的挑衅政策。”也正如约里奥—居里在世界和平理事会特别会议开幕会议上所说：“必须提到人类历史上最凶恶的一章：美国军队的使用生物武器。”在这种情况下，全世界人民必须进行更加紧张、更有组织的斗争，以消除帝国主义侵略战争的威胁。因此，世界和平理事会特别会议的各项决议不仅表达了各国爱好和平人民对于和平的日益深切的渴望，不仅引起了世界各国人民一致热烈的响应，更重要的是它必然会而且已经有力地推进了各国人民争取和平的伟大运动。
    当前和平的最急迫的任务，就是立即停止朝鲜战争，早日恢复朝鲜的和平。因此，世界和平理事会特别会议通过了“关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议”。这个决议指出了朝鲜停战谈判之所以迟迟未能取得协议的根本原因是：“美国军队对中国的侵略行动正越来越频繁，从而造成了扩大战争的危机；继轰炸中国的许多城市、在中国领土上使用生物武器、并再三扬言要使用原子弹之后，最近竟然又轰炸鸭绿江上以电力供给中国东北工业的发电厂，这是一种蓄谋的挑衅行动，目的是要使缔结停战协议更趋困难。”为了结束朝鲜人民的苦难和保卫东方和世界的和平，该决议书最后号召所有的人民起来要求：
    “（一）在尊重国际法和惯例的原则下签订停战协议，立即结束敌对行动；停战协议能否签订现在完全取决于美方代表团是否放弃它在战俘遣返问题上的无理要求。
    （二）一切国家都批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用细菌作战方法的日内瓦议定书。”
    同时大家知道，美帝国主义者正在疯狂地扩张军备、保持并加深德国的分裂，千方百计阻止德国恢复统一，并且违背德国和日本大多数人民的意志，力图复活这两个国家的军国主义势力。针对这种局势，世界和平理事会特别会议通过了“关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书”和“关于反对日本重新军国主义化、为民主的日本而斗争的决议”。 
    关于德国问题的决议书中说：“世界和平理事会认为，最好的决定就是立即召开四大国会议，通过为了和平解决德国问题的一切决定。世界和平理事会认为，最好的决定就是让德国人民自己通过自由选举独立地实现他们的统一，并成立一个会和一切曾和希特勒德国作战的国家缔结和约的政府。
    这个条约应该承认统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国享有自主权。
    这个条约将规定外国占领军撤退的条件，而根据这个条约，德国将保证不参加任何军事联盟。它也将帮助欧洲各国人民使他们能够在安全、合作和尊重他们的独立的情况下，自己决定自己的命运。”
     关于日本问题的决议书中说：“鉴于战争在亚洲
    扩大的威胁，世界和平理事会认为：旧金山条约和
    随之而来的协定是非法的，因为它们没有尊重国际
    协定；必须另行签订一个由所有有关国家签字的真正的条约。
    这个条约应该规定：
    （甲）一切占领军撤离日本，外国不得在日本建立军事基地。
    （乙）日本人民有充分的主权，他们需要在民主、和平的气氛中发展。”在这两个决议书的号召下，日本人民和德国人民正在为粉碎强加在他们身上的战争条约而展开了坚决的斗争。
    世界和平理事会特别会议还通过了“关于召开世界人民和平大会的宣言”的决议。该决议书说：“一九五二年十二月五日，世界人民和平大会将在维也纳开幕。举行范围极广的人民投票，将使一切国家中筹备这个大会的工作得到保证。所有的人们，不论男女，不分意见和信仰，集合在一起讨论并作出你们的决定吧！选出你们出席这次盛会的代表吧。你们的要求和平的意愿务必要表达出来。
    为了达到将由大家共同来确定的目标，世界人民和平大会将把所有的人团结起来，不管他们抱什么主张、属于什么派别或团体，只要他们希望裁减军备，获得安全和民族独立，希望自由选择他们的生活方式，并希望缓和国际紧张局面。
    凡是希望协商精神战胜武力决定的人，世界人民和平大会都要把他们团结起来。”这个决议立即得到了全世界亿万男女和许多国际性的群众组织的热烈响应，它已经成为各国人民和平运动中的一个重要的行动口号了。
    必须着重指出，世界和平理事会特别会议对于美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题给予了特别的注意。会议批准了世界和平理事会今年四月间奥斯陆会议所通过的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书。这个以世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里为首所签署的文件向全世界男女大声疾呼：
    “我们仔细地研讨了有关目前在中国和朝鲜进行的细菌战的文件以后，深感焦虑和震惊。细菌战不仅是应该予以制止的丑恶罪行，而且是对全人类的威胁。我们向全世界男女的良心呼吁，号召他们要求制止细菌战和禁止细菌武器。我们首先向美国的男女呼吁，因为他们每个人的面前都出现了一个正直与否和品格如何的问题。朝鲜战争之用联合国名义进行，是一种特别严重的情况；我们认为：那些赞成联合国进行干涉因而对进行战争所使用的方法负有道义和政治责任的政府，应对这种情况负责。至于我们，则负有双重义务：首先便是向舆论界报告情况，并把真相告诉每一个人，使人人都能判断我们已经晓得的丑恶事实。我们决定公布我们现有的文件，必须使罪行大白于天下。为了使这些罪行大白于天下，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会建议成立一个能够收集一切事实的国际委员会。这个委员会的权威性和公正性应该是无可争辩的。为了建立这个委员会，我们请科学界、法律界和宗教界最有威望的代表参加。我们确信世界舆论必将支持这个委员会的努力。我们的第二个义务就是保卫所有的人民，使免于细菌战的浩劫。我们认为：只有美国，也就是大国中唯一的国家，才没有批准一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的国际公约。我们要求全世界人民对本国的政府施加压力，以使所有国家都毫无例外地签署、批准并遵守这个公约。我们同时要求采取强有力的行动，把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。我们确信，我们提出保护无辜者而惩办罪犯的要求，是代表着绝大多数人的意见的。我们代表他们捍卫最崇高的事业——一切儿童生存的权利以及对人性的尊重。如果各国人民不立即行动起来制止细菌战，那么，破坏力量的残酷狂暴是没有止境的。我们号召人类起来自卫。”
    这个“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书已在全世界人们的思想和行动中引起了深刻的反响。各国人民为反对细菌战、禁止使用细菌武器、要求一切国家批准并遵守一九二五年禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书而展开的猛烈斗争，已经汇合成一支强大的不可战胜的洪流；而顽固地拒绝批准日内瓦议定书并公然继续使用细菌武器的美国侵略者不仅日趋孤立，而且必然将遭到全世界人民的正义惩罚。
    世界和平理事会特别会议的各项决议大大鼓舞了全世界人民为争取和平、反对战争而斗争的胜利信心，同时也给当前各国人民保卫和平运动规定了明确的目标和具体的任务。这些受到全体正义人类热烈欢迎和拥护的决议，正在全世界千百万男女中广泛传播着，这就是全世界和平斗士的行动纲领和他们进行斗争的力量的巨大源泉。
