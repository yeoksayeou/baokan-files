    Cheering for the Happiness of Young Students

    Editor: After reading the "Instructions of the Government Administration Council on Several Issues Concerning the Work of Adjusting College Graduates" published in the People's Daily on June 27th, I deeply felt that the People's Government's care and consideration for college graduates are meticulous and unprecedented. The government has stipulated certain solutions for problems such as being employed in fields unrelated to one's major, illness, weakness, unfamiliarity with the regional climate, family difficulties, and the location and work unit of one's spouse. This is truly like a loving mother caring for her children, which stands in stark contrast to the situation under the reactionary rule in the past, where a large number of graduates were employed in fields unrelated to their major or became unemployed upon graduation. I feel infinite pride and happiness for the young students of New China. I hope that college graduates participating in the work of various government departments will fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity and strive for the great construction cause of New China.

    为青年学生的幸福欢呼
    编辑同志：看了六月二十七日人民日报登载的“政务院发出关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”以后，我深深体会到人民政府对于高等学校毕业生的关怀和照顾，是无微不至的，这是有史以来从未有过的事情。对于用非所学、生病、体弱、地区气候不习惯、家庭困难、爱人所在的地区和工作部门等等问题，政府都规定了一定的解决办法，这真像一个慈祥的母亲爱护子女一样，和过去反动派统治下那种大量的学非所用，毕业即失业的情况，恰成一个显明的对照。我为新中国的青年学生感到无限的骄傲和幸福。希望参加政府各部门工作的高等学校毕业生在工作岗位上充分发挥积极性和创造性，为新中国的伟大建设事业而努力。
