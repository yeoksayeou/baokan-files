    Suggest Collecting Scattered Waste Shell Casings
    When the Wanbei Livestock Farm in Southern Anhui was digging pond silt, they picked up many gun and artillery bullets. According to comrades from the local People's Armed Forces Department, these bullets were left behind when the Japanese surrendered, and there were quite a few of them. However, because some ammunition was still effective and transportation was inconvenient, they were stockpiled. I believe that the outer casings of these bullets are industrially useful raw materials; relevant authorities should solve the transportation difficulties and concentrate these items for utilization.

    Editor's Note: Reader Yan Ligeng's opinion is correct. In order to solve this problem, we have contacted the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry. The responsible comrade of the Ministry of Heavy Industry suggests that local people's governments call on the masses to collect waste shell casings scattered throughout various regions (those that have not become ineffective must first be dismantled by the local armed forces departments), transport them to places with convenient transportation by the local governments, and notify the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which can then send people to transport them.

    建议搜集散存各地的废弹壳
    皖南区湾北畜牧场在挑塘泥时，拣出很多枪炮子弹。据当地人民武装部门的同志说：这些子弹是日寇投降时丢下的，数量不少。但因某些弹药还未失效，又因运输不便，就被积压起来了。我认为：这些子弹的外壳，都是工业上有用的原料；有关机关应该解决运输上的困难，把这些东西集中起来，加以利用。阎立耕
    编者按：读者阎立耕的意见是正确的。为了解决这个问题，我们曾和中央人民政府重工业部联系。重工业部负责同志建议各地人民政府号召群众搜集散存各地的废弹壳（没有失效的则必须先由地方武装部门设法拆卸），由当地政府运至交通方便的地方，通知重工业部，当即可派人去运。
