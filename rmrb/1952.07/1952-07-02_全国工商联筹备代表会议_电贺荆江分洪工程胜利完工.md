    Cables Congratulations on the Successful Completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
    The Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce sent a cable of congratulations on the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. The cable reads as follows:
    To the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Headquarters, via the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee:
    The entire delegation of the Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was immensely excited to hear of the successful completion of the great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Construction Project during its meeting. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, long yearned for by millions of people, has been rapidly completed thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government. It has eliminated the disasters of floods that have occurred for hundreds of years and strengthened the power of water conservancy and transportation. During the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Chinese worker and peasant brothers and sisters fully demonstrated their spirit of hard work, selfless dedication, and patriotism, showcasing the diligence and wisdom of the Chinese working people. The heroic People's Liberation Army, for the happiness and safety of the people of the motherland, fought tirelessly on the forefront of this peaceful construction. In particular, Soviet friends gave us much guidance and assistance in this great construction project of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion. The contributions of all workers, engineers, and experts who participated in this great project are indelible. We extend our utmost enthusiasm and congratulations on the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, and offer our highest respect.
