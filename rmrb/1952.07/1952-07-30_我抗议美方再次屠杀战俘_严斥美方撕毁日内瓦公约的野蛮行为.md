Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 29th: General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, lodged a serious protest today, July 29th, against the US side's barbaric act of once again massacring our captured personnel at the Nonsan POW camp on July 27th, and deliberately tearing up the Geneva Convention. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows:

To Major General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation: According to your news reports, on July 27, 1952, your side again killed one and injured seven of our captured personnel at the Nonsan POW camp. I lodge a serious protest with your side regarding this latest incident of massacring our captured personnel. According to extremely incomplete materials revealed in your news reports, since February of this year, your side has continuously massacred our captured personnel, resulting in over eight hundred deaths and injuries. Your side has not provided any explanation for the serious incidents of massacring our captured personnel in the past. The 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War clearly stipulates that prisoners of war must be treated humanely and must not be killed. However, your side, disregarding our repeated protests, continues to persecute, abuse, and massacre prisoners of war. Your side must bear full and absolute responsibility for this barbaric act of deliberately tearing up the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. I demand that your side immediately provide a clear and responsible explanation for the July 27th incident and the past incidents of massacring prisoners of war.

    我抗议美方再次屠杀战俘
    严斥美方撕毁日内瓦公约的野蛮行为
    【新华社开城二十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在二十九日对于二十七日美方在论山战俘营又一次屠杀我方被俘人员，执意撕毁日内瓦公约的野蛮行为，提出严重抗议。南日将军的抗议全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：根据你方新闻报道，一九五二年七月二十七日你方又在论山战俘营打死我方被俘人员一名，打伤我方被俘人员七名，对这又一次的屠杀我方被俘人员的事件，我向你方提出严重抗议。根据你方新闻报道所透露的极不完全的材料，自今年二月份以来，你方连续不断地屠杀我方被俘人员，死伤已达八百余名，你方对于历次屠杀我方被俘人员的严重事件，迄未作过任何交代。一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约明确规定，战俘必须被给以人道的待遇，不得加以杀害，而你方不顾我方历次的抗议，不断迫害虐待和屠杀战俘，对于这种执意撕毁日内瓦战俘公约的野蛮行为，你方必须担负全部和绝对的责任。我要求你方立即对于七月二十七日和过去历次屠杀战俘的事件作毫不含糊的负责的交代。
