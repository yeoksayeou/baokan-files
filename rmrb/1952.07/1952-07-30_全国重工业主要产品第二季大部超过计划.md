Most of the major heavy industrial products nationwide exceeded their production plans in the second quarter of this year. Among the twenty-three major products, seventeen fulfilled 101 to 147.5 percent of their plans, and six fulfilled 68.2 to 99 percent of their plans. The average completion rate for these twenty-three major products was 105.7 percent. Among them, steel ingots were completed at 114 percent, steel products at 110 percent, and pig iron, despite more furnace repairs in June, was also completed at 99 percent. The highest completion rate was for internal combustion engines, reaching 147.5 percent.

The average completion rate of major product production plans in the second quarter exceeded that of the first quarter by 4.3 percent. This is because, during the intense phase of the "Three-Anti" movement in the second quarter, the heavy industry system basically achieved a balance between the "Three-Anti" campaign and production, bringing production back on track. With the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" movement, a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy is gradually unfolding in the heavy industry system.

    全国重工业主要产品第二季大部超过计划
    全国重工业的主要产品今年第二季度大部超额完成了生产计划。在二十三种主要产品中，有十七种完成计划百分之一百零一到一百四十七点五，有六种完成计划百分之六十八点二到百分之九十九。这二十三种主要产品的平均完成率是百分之一百零五点七。其中钢锭完成了百分之一百一十四，钢材完成了百分之一百一十，生铁在六月份修炉较多的情况下，也完成了百分之九十九。完成率最大的是内燃机，达百分之一百四十七点五。
    第二季度主要产品生产计划的平均完成率超过第一季度百分之四点三，这是因为在“三反”运动紧张阶段的第二季，重工业系统已基本上做到了“三反”和生产兼顾，使生产走向正规。随着“三反”运动的胜利结束，一个大规模的增产节约运动正在重工业系统逐步展开。
