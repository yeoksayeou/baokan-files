    Catholic Beijing Dongjiaominxiang Revolutionary Committee, etc.
    Support Johnson's Just Struggle
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Chinese Catholic Beijing Dongjiaominxiang Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Methodist Church Asbury Church Youth Fellowship Wang Yuping and 30 other people sent letters to this newspaper, expressing their support for the just actions of British Reverend Johnson in his struggle for peace. The Catholic Beijing Dongjiaominxiang Revolutionary Committee, representing all parishioners, wrote: "We parishioners of the Dongjiaominxiang Parish, the parish priest, and all members of the Revolutionary Committee, in addition to supporting the protest declaration of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and Vice Bishop Li, will further strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle in the future, thoroughly carry out patriotic revolutionary work, and resolutely take practical actions to strive for the early realization of peace." Wang Yuping and others from the Beijing Methodist Church Asbury Church Youth Fellowship wrote: "The British ruling class dares to openly slander this respectable 78-year-old peace elder, and their newspapers dare to suppress the statement signed by leaders of our vast Christian community exposing the crimes of American imperialist germ warfare. We express our greatest indignation at this shameless act, and call on all Christians with a sense of justice in the world to join us in condemning this crime and taking action to support Reverend Johnson's just struggle."

    天主教北京东交民巷革新委员会等
    支持约翰逊的正义斗争
    【本报讯】中国天主教北京市东交民巷革新委员会和北京卫理公会亚斯立堂青年团契王毓萍等三十一人给本报来信，表示支持英国约翰逊教长为和平而斗争的正义行动。天主教北京市东交民巷革新委员会代表全体教友来信说：“我们东交民巷堂区教友，本堂神甫及革新委员会全体人员，除支持市革新委员会及李副主教的抗议宣言外，今后更要加强反帝国主义斗争，彻底进行爱国革新工作，坚决以实际行动来争取和平早日实现。”北京卫理公会亚斯立堂青年团契王毓萍等来信说：“英国统治阶级竟敢公然诽谤这位可敬的七十八龄的和平老人，他们的报纸竟敢扣压我广大基督教徒领袖签名的揭露美帝国主义细菌战罪行的声明，我们对这种无耻行径表示最大的愤慨，并号召世界上一切有正义感的基督徒和我们一同指责这种罪行，以行动来支援约翰逊教长的正义斗争。”
