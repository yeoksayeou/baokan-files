    Anhui South State-Owned Tongguanshan Construction Company
    Reviews Errors of Bureaucratism

    Editor: After the People's Daily published Comrade Xiaoping's letter on September 12th of last year, criticizing our company's errors in losing its position and protecting feudal headmen, our company organized a working group and sent cadres to conduct in-depth investigations on the ground to study solutions. The working group's report shows that our company had serious bureaucratic work styles on this issue.

    The situation among the construction workers in Tongguanshan and Comrade Xiaoping's criticisms are basically consistent. 1. The phenomenon of subcontracting existed here without any change. Headmen exploited workers under more than ten pretexts, such as food, wage distribution, and grain valuation. The headmen also frequently transferred workers, making it impossible for workers to understand the situation. According to investigation materials, individual headmen exploited workers to the tune of several tens of millions of yuan in Tongguanshan in a single year. This brutal exploitation not only left workers living in poverty and illness but also affected the quality of the project, causing significant losses to the state. 2. Our company's administrative leadership should bear the primary responsibility for the problems that occurred in Tongguanshan. When our company initially organized the engineering office, the use of the headman system was a common phenomenon. Later, we lacked timely measures to change or limit exploitation. At the same time, some leading cadres of the engineering office were deceived by the sweet talk of the headmen and lost their class standpoint.

    Currently, the leadership of our engineering office has made a review of the above-mentioned serious bureaucratic work style and has begun to carry out reform work, with some initial results. The personnel involved in this matter are being dealt with by the relevant departments.

### 皖南国营铜官山建筑公司  检讨官僚主义的错误

    皖南国营铜官山建筑公司
    检讨官僚主义的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报去年九月十二日，刊登了小平同志的来信，批评我公司丧失立场包庇封建把头的错误后，我公司即组织工作组派出干部深入实地调查，研究解决问题的办法。从工作组汇报的情况，可以看出我公司在这个问题上是有严重的官僚主义作风的。
    铜官山建筑工人中的情况和小平同志的批评是基本相符的。一、转包现象在我们这里原封不动地存在着。把头用十多种名目剥削工人，如伙食，工资发放，粮食折价等。把头还经常调换工人，使工人摸不到底。据调查材料所得，个别把头在铜官山一年中就剥削到数千万元。这种残酷的剥削不但使工人过着贫病交迫的痛苦生活，而且影响到工程质量，使国家受到不少损失。二、铜官山发生的问题，主要责任应由我公司行政领导方面来负。我公司在开始组织工程处的时候，延用把头制度是普遍的现象，以后，又缺乏及时改变或限制剥削的必要措施，同时工程处的某些领导干部，在把头的甜言蜜语下受了蒙蔽，丧失了阶级立场。
    目前，我们工程处的领导方面，对上述严重的官僚主义作风已做了检讨，并开始进行改革工作，初步有些收效。和这件事有关的人员，有关方面正在处理。    皖南国营铜官山建筑公司
