    Northeast China Vigorously Prepares for Literacy Campaign
    Northeast China is vigorously carrying out various preparations for a large-scale literacy campaign. Leadership organizations for the literacy movement have been established and strengthened in various places. The Liaodong Provincial Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee has reorganized its original organizational structure. Shenyang City has established an office for promoting the rapid literacy method to uniformly lead the city's literacy movement. In order to conduct in-depth and widespread mobilization, various places have extensively launched publicity work to promote the rapid literacy method. Heilongjiang Province held a publicity work conference on promoting the rapid literacy method and formulated a plan to publicize the rapid literacy method. Fushun City held a rapid literacy method publicity week in mid-June. Currently, Northeast China is combining the experimental work of rapid literacy with large-scale teacher training. According to local plans, this year will train 10,660 worker teachers (excluding Rehe) and 80,600 farmer teachers.
    Central South China Formulates Plan to Launch Rapid Literacy Movement
    The Central South China region has determined a plan on how to further launch the literacy movement among workers and peasants throughout the region. Currently, in cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Changsha, Hengyang, Nanchang, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou in the Central South China region, and in many counties in Henan Province, more than 34,000 workers, peasants, and cadres of worker-peasant origin have participated in rapid literacy learning. Among them, those who have studied for about 100 hours have mostly recognized 1,500 to 2,200 characters and can read popular newspapers and write short essays. The learning achievements of students in rapid literacy classes in various places have greatly encouraged many workers and peasants who originally did not believe that literacy could be achieved quickly.
    Shanghai Municipality Stipulates Measures for Introducing Martyrs' and Soldiers' Children to Schools
    In order to correctly implement the policy of preferential treatment for revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' families, and to continue helping the out-of-school children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers and their out-of-school younger siblings under the age of sixteen who rely on them for living, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, has formulated the "Provisional Measures of Shanghai Municipality for Introducing the Out-of-School Children of Revolutionary Martyrs and Revolutionary Soldiers and Their Out-of-School Younger Siblings Under the Age of Sixteen Who Rely on Them for Living to Schools," which was issued to the People's Governments of various districts in Shanghai on the 9th, and instructed them to earnestly abide by the provisions of the measures upon receiving the order, carry out registration, and introduce them to schools separately.
    Shanghai Literary and Art Rectification Movement Basically Concluded
    The Shanghai literary and art rectification movement has now basically concluded. During the study, more than 1,300 literary and art workers universally linked theory with practice and examined various erroneous literary and artistic ideas. During the discussion process, the vast majority of literary and art workers seriously and earnestly carried out criticism and self-criticism, achieving the goal of improving literary and artistic thought. For example, some traditional Chinese painting workers examined the "Lao-Zhuang" ideology in landscape paintings and realized that they had previously treated the great revolutionary struggle with the erroneous attitude of "standing aloof from worldly affairs." Many staff members of the Shanghai People's Art Theater criticized various incorrect motives for engaging in literary and artistic work. Many literary and art workers' existing contradictions between ideology and technology, egalitarianism, blind worship of the West, and confused ideas such as underestimating national heritage have all been corrected in the study.

    东北大力进行识字运动的准备工作
    东北各地正在大力进行大规模识字运动的各种准备工作。各地已分别建立与加强了识字运动的领导机构。辽东省职工业余教育委员会已整顿了原有的组织机构。沈阳市成立了推行速成识字法办公室，统一领导该市的识字运动。为了进行深入普遍的动员，各地广泛地展开了推行速成识字法的宣传工作。黑龙江省举行了推行速成识字法的宣传工作会议，制订了宣传速成识字法的计划。抚顺市在上月中旬曾举行一次速成识字法宣传周。目前东北各地正在结合速成识字的试验工作，大规模培养师资。根据各地计划，今年将训练出职工教师一万零六百六十名（不包括热河），农民教师八万零六百名。
    中南区制定计划开展速成识字运动
    中南区已确定了如何进一步在全区工农群众中开展识字运动的计划。目前，在中南区的武汉、广州、南宁、长沙、衡阳、南昌、开封、郑州等城市和河南省的许多县份，已有三万四千多工人、农民和工农出身的机关干部，参加了速成识字学习。他们中凡经过一百小时左右学习的，大部分已认识了一千五百到二千二百个字，能看通俗书报和写作短文。各地速成识字班学员的学习成绩，大大地鼓舞了许多原来不相信识字能够速成的工农群众。
    上海市订定办法介绍烈士军人子女入学
    为了正确贯彻优待革命烈士、革命军人家属的政策，继续帮助革命烈士革命军人失学子女及依靠其生活之十六岁以下的失学弟妹入学，上海市人民政府特遵照中央人民政府内务部所颁“革命烈士家属、革命军人家属优待暂行条例”制定了“上海市革命烈士革命军人失学子女及依靠其生活之十六岁以下的失学弟妹介绍入学暂行办法”，已于九日颁发上海市各区人民政府，并指示于令到后切实遵照办法规定，展开登记，分别介绍入学。
    上海文艺整风运动基本结束
    上海文艺整风运动现已基本上结束。在学习中，一千三百多文艺工作者普遍联系实际，检查了各种错误的文艺思想。在讨论过程中，绝大多数文艺工作者认真严肃地展开批评和自我批评，达到了改进文艺思想的目的。如部分国画工作者检查了山水画中的“老庄”思想，认识到他们过去曾以“置身于事外”的错误态度来对待伟大的革命斗争。上海人民艺术剧院许多工作人员批判了从事文艺工作各种不正确的动机。许多文艺工作者存在的思想与技术对立，平均主义思想，盲目崇拜西洋及轻视民族遗产等混乱思想，在学习中都得到了纠正。
