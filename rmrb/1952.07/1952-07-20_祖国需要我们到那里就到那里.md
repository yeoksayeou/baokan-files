    Wherever the Motherland Needs Us, We Will Go

    To the Editor: We are graduating students from the Cadre School of the Ministry of Communications, soon to take up our posts. We are welcoming the tasks entrusted to us by the motherland with immense excitement, and we are ready to go to the places where the motherland needs us most to participate in the transportation construction of the Great Southwest. One hundred percent of us students are unconditionally obeying the organization's assignments, because we deeply recognize the importance of transportation construction in the overall national construction and feel the glory and significance of our tasks. Although the working environment in Kangzang is relatively difficult and arduous, we know that the more difficult the environment, the stronger we can become.

    Looking back to when we first came to the school to study, everyone had serious selfish and self-serving thoughts. Some students had significant ideological fluctuations because they were afraid of going to the Northwest or Southwest; some individual students left the school because they were afraid of hardship. However, for more than a year, through the continuous education of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, the students clarified their thinking, strengthened their revolutionary stance, and also made great progress in technical skills. We deeply realize that we can only have a bright future if we always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. As we are about to take up our posts, we promise to respond to the education and cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party with practical actions. We must maintain the style of hard work and simplicity, constantly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, delve into science and technology, and exercise to become well-rounded individuals. In future work, we must correctly implement the Party's ethnic policies and contribute everything we have to the construction of the motherland's border regions.

    The fifty-four students from the Nanjing Branch of the Cadre School of the Ministry of Communications, who are going to work in the Southwest.

    祖国需要我们到那里就到那里
    编辑同志：我们是即将走上工作岗位的中央交通部干部学校的毕业同学。我们以无比兴奋的心情来迎接祖国付托我们的任务，到祖国最需要的地方去，参加大西南的交通建设。我们百分之百的同学都做到无条件地服从组织分配，因为我们都深切地认识到交通建设在整个国家建设中的重要性，感到自己任务的光荣和重大。虽然康藏的工作环境是比较艰难困苦的，但是我们晓得，环境愈困苦，越能使我们变得坚强。
    回顾我们初到校学习的时候，大家都有严重的自私自利的思想。有些同学曾经因为怕到西北、西南去而引起极大的思想波动；有个别的同学因为怕吃苦而脱离了学校。可是一年多以来，经过共产党、青年团的不断教育，同学们澄清了思想，坚定了革命的立场，在技术业务上也获得很大的进步。我们深切体会到我们只有永远跟着毛主席、共产党走，才有自己的远大前程。在行将走上工作岗位的时候，我们保证要以实际行动来回答毛主席、共产党的教育和培养。我们要保持坚苦朴素的作风，不断地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，钻研科学技术，锻炼身体，使自己成为一个全面发展的人。在今后的工作中要正确地执行党的民族政策，为祖国的边疆建设而贡献自己的一切。
    中央交通部干部学校南京分校全体赴西南工作的五十四位同学
