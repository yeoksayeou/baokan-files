Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: The Yoshida government in Japan is becoming increasingly unpopular, and the calls from the Japanese people and various opposition parties for the dissolution of the Diet and an early general election are growing louder.

General elections in Japan (i.e., elections for the House of Representatives) are held every four years. Under normal circumstances, the next general election should be held in January of next year after the expiration of the term of the current members of the House of Representatives. However, the current Diet and the Yoshida government's increasingly intensified traitorous actions have become unbearable for the Japanese people. Since October of last year, the Japanese Diet has successively passed the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," and other treaties that enslave the Japanese people to the United States and betray the interests of the Japanese people. It has also approved a series of fascist bills formulated by the Yoshida government, particularly the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." This series of reactionary and traitorous measures has aroused widespread opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people, and the opposition parties have also expressed dissatisfaction. The Japanese Communist Party has repeatedly put forward the proposition of overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet and dissolving the Diet. The left wing of the Socialist Party also held an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee in late June to discuss the issue of the general election. The party chairman, Suzuki Mosaburo, believes that the Yoshida Cabinet's traitorous actions are "the same crime as Class A war criminals" and must be overthrown. Even within the Liberal Party, the anti-Yoshida faction, the Hatoyama group, is also advocating an early general election in an attempt to replace the Yoshida group. Therefore, under these circumstances, Kyodo News Agency said: "The atmosphere of dissolving the Diet seems to be rapidly thickening." "If this continues, as the opposition parties say, 'the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet is precarious'." Kyodo News Agency also pointed out that the possibility of an early dissolution of the Diet and a general election is "increasing day by day."

Currently, some Japanese political parties have already drafted their election platforms, while others are in the process of drafting them. Advocating or opposing the revival of Japanese militarism will become the central issue of all election platforms. As early as January of this year, the Japanese Communist Party put forward the anti-imperialist, patriotic, and unified election platform to all patriotic parties and patriotic people. This platform clearly opposes the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the militarization of Japan, advocates overthrowing the Liberal Party's traitorous government, and establishing a national liberation united government. Other opposition parties are also formulating their election platforms, and the will of the Japanese people will have a certain impact on these platforms. For example, the draft platform of the right wing of the Socialist Party also puts forward the proposition of "opposing rearmament and opposing the revision of the constitution." On the other hand, due to the serious difficulties encountered in implementing the policy of re-militarization, there are serious divisions between the ruling Yoshida group and the opposition Hatoyama group within the Liberal Party. Therefore, the Liberal Party has not yet formulated a unified election platform.

Faced with the opposition of the Japanese people, the Liberal Party lacks confidence in the upcoming general election. Although it currently holds more than 280 seats in the House of Representatives, according to Kyodo News Agency, the Liberal Party believes that only 250 seats are "unshakable" in the general election. In order to control the general election, the Liberal Party has made advance arrangements. The main measure is to revise the current election law. The revised election law greatly restricts legitimate election activities. During the election campaign, door-to-door visits, posting propaganda posters, street speeches, and freedom of reporting and commentary in newspapers and magazines are either prohibited or severely restricted. On the other hand, the deposit for candidates has been greatly increased. For small parties that nominate fewer than twenty-five candidates, the new law even deprives them of the right to conduct political activities during the election campaign.

    日本人民要求解散国会提前大选
    吉田政府一系列的反动卖国行为引起普遍反对
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府日益不得人心，日本人民和各在野党派要求解散国会，提前举行大选的呼声已越来越响亮了。
    日本大选（即众议员选举）每四年举行一次。在正常的情况下，下届大选应在明年一月间现任众议员的任期满期后举行。但本届国会与吉田政府的日益加紧的卖国行为，已使日本人民不堪忍耐。从去年十月起，日本国会接连通过了让美国奴役日本人民的旧金山和约、美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”以及其他若干出卖日本人民利益的条约，它也批准了吉田政府所制订的一系列的法西斯法案，特别是所谓“防止破坏活动法”。这一系列的反动卖国措施，引起了日本广大人民普遍的反对，而各在野党也表示不满。日本共产党早已多次地提出了打倒吉田内阁、解散国会的主张。社会党左派也在六月下旬召开中央委员会扩大会议，讨论大选问题。该党主席铃木茂三郎认为吉田内阁的卖国行为，是“和甲级战犯同样的罪行”，必须打倒。甚至在自由党内部，反对派鸠山集团也主张提早大选，企图接替吉田集团。因此，在这种情况下，共同社说：“解散国会的空气似乎是迅速地浓厚起来了。”“这样发展下去，正如在野党所说的一样：‘吉田内阁的命运危在旦夕’。”共同社并指出：提前解散国会、举行大选的可能性“日见增加”。
    现在，日本各政党有的已经拟订了自己的竞选纲领，有的正在拟订。主张或反对复活日本军国主义将成为一切竞选纲领的中心问题。日本共产党早在今年一月间就向一切爱国党派、爱国人士提出了反帝国主义爱国统一选举纲领，这个纲领明确地反对旧金山和约与日本军国主义化，主张打倒自由党卖国政府，并建立民族解放联合政府。其他的在野党也在制订它们的竞选纲领，日本人民的意志将对这些纲领产生一定的影响。例如，像社会党右派的纲领草案也提出了“反对重整军备和反对修改宪法”的主张。另一方面，由于执行重新军国主义化的政策遭到严重困难，自由党内部当权派的吉田集团与反对派鸠山集团之间存在着严重分歧。因此，自由党直到现在还没有制订出统一的竞选纲领。
    面临着日本人民的反对情绪，自由党对未来的大选是信心不足的。虽然它目前在众议院有着二百八十多席，但据共同社讯，自由党认为在大选中“不会动摇”的只有二百五十席。为了控制大选，自由党已经预作布置。其中主要的措施就是修改现行的选举法。修改后的选举法大大地限制了正当的竞选活动。在选举运动期间进行挨户访问、张贴宣传画、街头演讲和报纸与杂志的报道与评论自由等，不是遭受禁止就是受到苛刻的限制。另一方面，候选人的保证金却被大量提高了。对于提出候选人不满二十五名的小党派，新法甚至剥夺了它们在选举运动中进行政治活动的权利。
