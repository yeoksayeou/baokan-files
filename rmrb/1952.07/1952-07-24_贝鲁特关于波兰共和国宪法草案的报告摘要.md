    The Constitutional Committee was established according to the constitutional law passed by the Parliament on May 26 last year, "Regarding the Procedure for Drafting and Adopting the Constitution of People's Poland." The committee was entrusted with drafting a preliminary draft of the constitution. The preliminary draft of the constitution, drafted in accordance with the constitutional law of May 26 last year, has undergone nationwide discussion. Citizens across the country widely participated in the discussion. More than 200,000 large and small meetings were held nationwide to discuss the draft constitution, with over 11 million people participating. During the discussion of the draft constitution, nearly 1.4 million citizens expressed their opinions, and more than 25,000 citizens submitted written opinions. These written opinions included a total of 2,822 amendments. The Constitutional Committee, summarizing the results of the national discussion, affirmed that the draft constitution it formulated received full approval and support from our millions of people. Some amendments have been considered in the final draft of the constitution submitted to the Parliament, and the Constitutional Committee, after discussion, believes that these amendments are correct.
    Why was this draft constitution of the Polish Republic, in this form and with this content, submitted to the Constituent Assembly for discussion only at the end of the Constituent Assembly's term, i.e., in 1952, and not at the beginning of the Constituent Assembly's establishment five years earlier? There are sufficient reasons for this. The constitution should be a summary, balance, and result of the social, political, and economic reforms that have been completed and serve as the basis of a country's social structure. Since the victorious Soviet army liberated Poland from the clutches of Hitler, the Polish working people have engaged in fierce class struggles, and the people's government has formulated corresponding laws based on these struggles. Such major legal measures include: the Land Reform Law promulgated on September 6, 1944, the law on the organization and activities of some people's committees on September 11, 1944, and the law on nationalizing the main sectors of the national economy on January 3, 1946. In terms of the organization and structure of the highest state power organs, the system stipulated by the 1921 Constitution was basically preserved in the first period, but with significant changes. According to the results of the national referendum on June 30, 1946, the bourgeois bicameral system was abolished, and a new state power organ was established as stipulated in the "Constitution" promulgated on February 19, 1947. The following two decrees are of decisive significance for the nature and speed of our country's economic development and for our country's industrialization: the first is the decree on the Three-Year Plan for the revival of the national economy, which we completed two months ahead of schedule; the second is the decree on the Six-Year Plan for transforming our country's economy on a new technological basis, which we call the plan for building the foundation of socialism in Poland, and during the implementation of this plan, we generally exceeded our predetermined tasks considerably year by year.
    Therefore, the current draft constitution is based on the victories and achievements made by our working masses in the economic, political, and social fields in the eight years since the establishment of the Polish Committee of National Liberation. This draft constitution is a manifestation of new political relations and the essence of the people's government, which has created our people's democratic state, consolidated its authority, strength, and system, fixed the democratic rights and freedoms of citizens, and also fixed the obligations of citizens. The current draft constitution, based on the consolidated foundation of the new economic relations and the new balance of class forces that we have already striven for and fixed, has the reality that has already been striven for and already exists in our current social life as its solid and powerful foundation.
    What kind of reality is this? What was our reality like in the past five or six years, and in what direction is it changing? I only intend to present here the most essential statistical materials in our socialist construction. We have been implementing a planned economy for almost six years. In 1947, the first year of the Three-Year Plan, the number of workers in various departments, excluding agriculture, increased to 3.18 million. This year it has increased to 5.34 million, which is almost twice the pre-war figure, and more than 68% greater than the figure for 1947. Our socialist industry today is gradually becoming a new type of industry equipped with new technologies in terms of industrialization, so labor productivity is also much higher than before. If we set the index of the number of workers and the index of production volume in large and medium-sized socialist industries in 1946 at 100, then in 1952, the index of the number of workers increased to 188, while the index of industrial output increased to 450, that is to say, the production value of each person this year, calculated at price, is almost 2.5 times that of 1946. The proportion of output from our socialist economic sector in the national income was 45.5% in 1946, 50.4% in 1947, 72.4% in 1951, and this year, according to the plan, it should reach 73.2%. The proportion of output from the socialist industrial sector in the total industrial output was 86.3% in 1946, 89.5% in 1947, and already reached 99.4% in 1951, and will reach 99.6% this year, that is to say, it can be considered that we have almost completely driven out the capitalist elements in our industry.
    Our trade is also developing in this direction. Individual small-scale farming dominates in agriculture, but even in agriculture, the proportion of socialist components is also growing rapidly. In 1946, the proportion of socialist components in the total value of agricultural production was just 2%, in 1947 it reached 5.3%, in 1951 it was 12.2%, and this year it will be nearly 16%. How fast the socialist components in agriculture have grown compared to six years ago can be demonstrated by the following index: if we take the production of the socialist part of agriculture in 1946 as 100 (at that time, the socialist components were only state-owned agriculture), the production index of state-owned agriculture had already increased more than two times in 1947, reaching 339%, in 1951 it reached 1264% including the production of agricultural production cooperatives, and according to the plan, it will reach 1781% this year, that is to say, it has almost increased 17 times in six years. There is no doubt that the principles stipulated in Articles 9 and 10 of the draft constitution will promote the development of the agricultural cooperative movement. The changes I have illustrated with figures are not only quantitative but also qualitative. Since the Polish working people became the masters, Poland's economy has undergone fundamental changes. Today, our entire national economy is serving their needs, their interests, the consolidation of their strength, and their future construction. This is the most essential thing. The most important truth is the foundation of the draft constitution. This truth runs through its entire content.
    The fundamental law of a people's state differs from the constitution of the bourgeoisie; it not only declares the rights and democratic freedoms of citizens but also guarantees these rights and freedoms. The draft constitution of the Polish Republic fully complies with this basic principle, because the strong and reliable pillars of citizens' rights and democratic freedoms are our socio-economic transformation, the people's nature of our regime, and the leading role of the Polish working class in this regime. In the construction of the new socialist and social system, the working class will always firmly defend its lasting alliance with the basic masses of the working peasantry. The consolidation of the people's regime and the state, the strengthening of its strength and sovereignty, is a reliable guarantee for the realization of the broad democratic rights of the workers. Equally important is the ability of the broadest masses to supervise and participate in the activities of people's power organs at all levels, as well as the practical connection of these organs with the workers in urban and rural areas. This principle is fully reflected in the draft constitution.
    The unwavering policy of the people's regime to restrict and exclude capitalist elements and eliminate all forms of exploitation is closely linked with the planned development of the socialized production sector, which is the foundation of the entire national economy, and with the policy of rapidly industrializing the country on a new technological basis, which is also a condition for raising the level of agriculture and consolidating our national defense. Constantly strengthening the economic ties between urban and rural areas on the basis of friendly cooperation between workers and peasants is a solid pillar of this policy. The people's regime guarantees assistance and protection to the individual economies of the working peasants and especially supports the increasingly developing voluntary combinations of farmers, which are a more advanced and more beneficial collective economic form for the farmers.
    The draft constitution recognizes and protects the private ownership of agricultural and handicraft economies, just like the private ownership of all citizens, and guarantees their inheritance rights. According to the constitution, all citizens should especially care for and protect public property.
    The foundation of the social system is labor. Article 14 of the draft constitution stipulates that labor in the Polish Republic is the measure of merit and obligation, and it is also the glorious duty of every citizen. This article says: "Advanced workers should be universally respected by the people." Our task is to utilize the great educational significance of these clauses in the constitution and at the same time explain to the working masses the socialist nature of the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."
    The draft constitution has made significant changes to the structure of the state power organs and state management organs compared to the current situation. This reform has changed the structure of the state power organs to closely connect them, deepen their democratization, that is, to eliminate the artificial separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers that violates democratic principles. The new draft constitution eliminates the old bourgeois remnants that originally existed in the state power organs, giving all power organs from the bottom up a unified nature. According to the basic principle of socialist democracy, attracting the broadest masses of workers to participate in the administration of the state, mobilizing the masses to conduct supervision, and making their relationship closer. According to the new constitution, all power organs are elected.
    Chapter 7 of the draft constitution, which stipulates the basic rights and obligations of citizens, aroused the greatest interest during the national discussion and also received universal and enthusiastic approval.
    The Constitutional Committee has always followed the principles of socialist democracy throughout the entire process of drafting the constitution. I think it is precisely because of this main reason that the working masses immediately recognized and felt that this constitution was their own work when they discussed the draft constitution of the Polish Republic nationwide.
    The draft constitution of the Polish Republic has aroused widespread discussion not only domestically but also abroad, not only among our friends but also among our enemies. The bourgeois newspapers of various countries, like they did before when talking about the constitutions of other people's democratic countries, stubbornly insisted that this is just a declaration that will not be honored. This argument is especially reflected in talking about the chapter on citizens' rights. The first thing we can retort to this argument is that it is just empty rhetoric, and the fact is:
    (1) The citizens' right to work can be confirmed by the fact that our unemployment phenomenon has been completely eliminated, which is completely not the case in capitalist countries;
    (2) For several years, the physical and mental workers in Poland have enjoyed the citizens' right to rest and paid vacations every year without exception; hundreds of thousands of workers are enjoying sanatoriums, rest homes, and travel tours. The working class in capitalist countries does not usually have this right;
    (3) The fact that Poland's national universal social insurance, which is fully paid for by various enterprises, proves that citizens enjoy the right to health care, which is absolutely non-existent in capitalist countries;
    (4) Citizens have the right to education, which can be proved by the fact that children in urban and rural areas across the country are generally receiving compulsory education, and the following figures can also illustrate this: 3.22 million children are studying in primary schools, 235,000 people are studying in secondary schools, nearly 580,000 people are studying in vocational schools, and the number of higher education institutions has also increased, from only 27 in 1938 to 32 in 1951, and the number of students has also increased from 48,000 to 134,000. Finally, there is also the fact that nearly 325,000 students in secondary schools, vocational schools, and higher education institutions are receiving state scholarships;
    (5) The expanding network of libraries, museums, theaters, cultural palaces, cinemas, and clubs guarantees citizens' right to enjoy cultural achievements. At present, the number of these cultural institutions exceeds many times the pre-war level and far exceeds many capitalist countries that are much larger than Poland;
    (6) Women have various rights, and they enjoy completely equal treatment. This can be confirmed by the various guarantees stipulated in the constitution, and it has long been put into practice. More and more women are being promoted to leadership positions, and the most noteworthy thing is the government's continuous care for mothers and infants, which can be seen from the following facts: the mortality rate of newborn infants has decreased by 27% compared to before the war, the child mortality rate has decreased by 40-70% (the causes of death are organ failure, gastrointestinal diseases, and other internal diseases and pediatric diseases), the mortality rate of urban maternal mortality has decreased by 87% compared to before the war, and it has decreased by 73% in rural areas. All of this is due to increased medical assistance to mothers and infants, and the increase in nurseries, kindergartens, and maternity hospitals. The natural population growth rate in 1938 was 10.7 per thousand people, and in 1950 it rose to 19 people, which is 78% higher than the pre-war growth rate. Polish statistics have never seen such a large natural population growth since 1948. The rise in the natural population growth rate is due to the increase in the birth rate on the one hand and the decrease in the mortality rate on the other hand. These two phenomena are undoubtedly the result of our country's economic and social reforms, and the rise in the living standards of the working people and the state's concern for residents' health care are the decisive factors.
    The remnants of Polish fascism, the spokespersons of the nobles and capitalist governments condemned by history, the rootless cosmopolitan exiles with bleak futures - this group of noisy errand boys hired by the United States, all say in unison that our draft constitution is a replica of the Soviet constitution. This only shows the hypocrisy and stupidity of the American errand boys. It is completely natural for a country like ours that is building socialism to utilize the great experience possessed by countries where socialism has already triumphed.
    However, it is also undeniable and obvious that our constitution grows out of the depths of the Polish land, out of the struggles of the Polish people, it realizes the wishes of the Polish people for generations, and inherits and develops the most advanced traditions of the Polish people that we can be proud of. The People's Polish Constitution was made possible entirely because human history has already undergone a transformation, and the great October Socialist Revolution was the beginning of this transformation. Every honest person knows very well that the Soviet army's defeat of the Hitler aggressors created the conditions for us to achieve independence, for the people to achieve power, and for the people to defeat the forces of capitalist exploitation and decay.
    The preamble to the draft constitution says: "We rely on the revolutionary achievements of the Polish and international workers' movement, and on the historic experience produced by the invincible socialist construction of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union - the first state of workers and peasants." We are proud to utilize the experience of the Soviet people, who have introduced us to their achievements in industry, technology, agriculture, health care, the art of profound humanitarianism, and advanced science like brothers. At the same time, we also deeply study our history, critically analyze it, and draw inspiration for today and the future.
    The Constitution of the Polish Republic will not only consolidate our achievements, but also pave the way for the complete victory of socialism. The Constitution of the Polish Republic will prove the greatness of our people, the lasting victory of the progressive movement in our people's history, and the victory of the cause of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance. Once the Constitution of the Polish Republic is passed by the Parliament, it will become our people's shield and weapon in the struggle to strive for the prosperity and strength of our motherland - the Polish Republic.

    贝鲁特关于波兰共和国宪法草案的报告摘要
    根据去年五月二十六日议会通过的“关于拟定与通过人民波兰宪法的程序”的制宪法，成立了制宪委员会。委员会受托制订宪法初步草案。根据去年五月二十六日的制宪法制订的宪法初步草案曾经进行全民讨论。全国公民普遍参加了讨论。全国讨论宪法草案的大小集会达二十万次以上，参加的人数超过一千一百万。在讨论宪法草案的过程中，将近一百四十万公民发表了意见，二万五千多公民提出了书面意见。这些书面意见中共包括二千八百二十二件修正案。制宪委员会总结全国人民讨论的结果，肯定它所制订的宪法草案受到我们千百万人民充分的赞成和支持。在向议会提出的宪法草案定稿中已考虑到一些修正，制宪委员会经过讨论后，认为这些修正都是正确的。
    为什么现在这种形式和内容的波兰共和国宪法草案，直到立宪议会成立的末期，即到一九五二年才交给立宪议会讨论而不在五年以前立宪议会成立的初期交付讨论呢？这是有充分理由的。宪法应当是已经完成了的、作为一个国家之社会结构的基础的社会、政治、经济各方面改革的总结、平衡和结果。自从胜利的苏军把波兰从希特勒魔爪下解放出来以后，波兰劳动人民进行了激烈的阶级斗争，人民政权依照这种斗争制定了相应的法律。这类巨大的法律措施有：一九四四年九月六日颁布的土地改革法，一九四四年九月十一日关于一些人民委员会的组织和活动的法律，一九四六年一月三日关于将国民经济主要部门收归国有的法律等。在最高国家权力机关的组织与结构方面，在第一段时期，基本上是保存了一九二一年的宪法所规定的体系，但是作了很重大的改变。根据一九四六年六月三十日的全民投票的结果，废除了资产阶级的两院制，建立了如一九四七年二月十九日颁布的“宪法”所规定的、新的国家权力机关。对于我国经济发展的性质和速度、对于我国的工业化，下面两个法令具有决定性的意义：第一个就是关于复兴国民经济三年计划的法令，这个计划我们已经提前两个月完成；第二个就是关于在新的技术基础上改造我国经济的六年计划的法令，我们把这计划叫做在波兰建设社会主义基础的计划，在这计划的执行期间中，我们一般说来是一年年地相当多地超额完成了我们预定的任务。
    因此，目前这个宪法草案，就是以我国劳动大众在波兰民族解放委员会成立以来的八年中在经济、政治和社会等方面取得的胜利和成就为依据的。这个宪法草案，是新的政治关系的表现，是人民政权本质的表现，这个政权创建了我们人民民主的国家，巩固了它的权威、力量和制度，把公民的民主权利和自由固定起来，同时也把公民的义务固定起来。目前这个宪法草案，依据着我们已经争取到的并且固定了的新的经济关系、新的阶级力量对比这种巩固的基础，有着已经争取到而且在我们当前社会生活中事实上已经存在的现实作为其巩固有力的基础。
    这是一种怎样的现实呢？我们在过去五、六年间的现实如何，又朝着怎样的方向变化的呢？我这里只打算提出在我们社会主义建设方面最本质的数字统计材料。我们实行计划经济，已经快有六年了。在一九四七年，即三年计划的第一年里，除农业之外，各部门劳动者的人数增加到三百十八万人。而在今年已增加到五百三十四万人，也就是说几乎等于战前数字的两倍，比一九四七年的数字大百分之六十八强。我们今天的社会主义工业，就工业化的程度来说，正逐渐变成具有新技术装备的新式工业，因此劳动生产率也比以前高得多。假如我们把一九四六年各大型和中型社会主义工业的工人数目指数和生产数量指数定为一百，那么在一九五二年里，工人数目指数增加到一百八十八，而工业产量指数却增加到了四百五十，也就是说今年每一个人的生产价值，按价格来计算，几乎为一九四六年的二点五倍。我国社会主义经济部门生产量在国民收入中所占的比重，一九四六年是百分之四十五点五，一九四七年是百分之五十点四，一九五一年就达到百分之七十二点四，而在本年内，按照计划，应该达到百分之七十三点二。社会主义工业部门产量在工业总产量中的比重，一九四六年是百分之八十六点三，一九四七年是百分之八十九点五，一九五一年就已经达到百分之九十九点四，今年将要达到百分之九十九点六，也就是说可以认为我们的工业中几乎已经完全驱逐了资本主义的因素。
    我们的贸易也是朝着这个方向发展的。在农业上占优势的是个体小农经济，然而就是在农业方面社会主义成分的比重也是迅速增长着。一九四六年社会主义成分在农业生产总价值中占的比重刚到百分之二，一九四七年则达到百分之五点三，一九五一年是百分之十二点二，今年则将要近乎百分之十六。农业中社会主义成分和六年前比较起来增长的速度究竟如何，下面的指数可以证明：如果拿一九四六年农业中的社会主义部分的生产作为一百的话
    （当时社会主义成分只有国营农业），国营农业的生产指数在一九四七年已经增加两倍多，即达百分之三三九，一九五一年连同农业生产合作社的生产共达百分之一二六四，依照计划，今年将达百分之一七八一，这就是说在六年中几乎增加十七倍。毫无疑问，宪法草案第九条和第十条规定的原则将推进农业合作社运动的发展。我用数字说明的变化不仅有量变的性质而且有质变的性质。自从波兰劳动人民当了主人以来，波兰的经济已经发生了根本的变化。今天我们全部国民经济都是为他们的需要、他们的利益、他们力量的巩固、他们的将来的建设而服务的。这就是最本质的东西。作为宪法草案的基础的正是这个最关重要的真理。这个真理贯穿着它的整个内容。
    人民国家的根本法不同于资产阶级的宪法，它不单是宣布公民权利和民主自由，而是保证这种权利和自由。波兰共和国的宪法草案完全符合这个基本原则，因为公民权利和民主自由的强大可靠的支柱是我们的社会经济改造以及我们政权的人民性质和波兰工人阶级在这个政权中所起的先锋的领导作用，在新的社会主义和社会制度的建设中，工人阶级永远坚定地捍卫它与劳动农民这个基本群众结成的持久联盟。人民政权和国家的巩固、它的实力和主权的加强，是实现劳动者的广泛民主权利的可靠保证。最广大的群众得以监督和参加各级人民政权机关的活动，以及这些机关跟城乡劳动者的实际联系也是同样重要的保证。这个原则充分表现在宪法草案中。
    人民政权所实行的限制和排斥资本主义因素和消灭一切形式的剥削的坚定不移的政策，跟有计划地发展作为整个国民经济基础的社会化的生产部门是密切联系着的，跟在新技术基础上迅速使全国工业化的政策是密切联系着的，而工业化同时也是提高农业水平和巩固我国国防力量的条件。在工农友爱合作的基础上经常加强城乡之间的经济联系，是这个政策的坚固的支柱。人民政权保证给劳动农民的个体经济以帮助和保护，并且特别支持日益发展中的农民自愿组合这种更高级而对农民也更有益的集体经济形式。
    宪法草案承认并保护农业经济和手工业经济的私有权，一如全体公民的私有权一样；并保障其继承权。根据宪法，一切公民均应特别关心并保护全民财产。
    社会制度的基础是劳动。宪法草案第十四条规定劳动在波兰共和国是衡量功绩和义务的尺度，同时也是每一个公民的光荣职责。这一条说：“先进劳动者应受到人民普遍的尊敬。”我们的任务是利用宪法这些条款的巨大教育意义，同时向劳动群众说明
    “各尽所能，各取所值”这个原则的社会主义性质。
    宪法草案在国家权力机关和国家管理机关的结构上，对现状作了重大的改变。这个改革改变了国家权力机关的结构，以密切它们之间的关系，使之更加深刻地民主化，即取消人为的违背民主原则的立法、行政、司法三权分立。新宪法草案消灭了国家权力机关原先存在的资产阶级旧残余，给自下而上的一切政权机关以统一的性质，根据吸引最广泛的劳动群众参加管理国家这一社会主义民主的基本原则，发动群众进行监督，使它们之间的关系更加密切起来。根据新宪法，一切政权机关均由选举产生。
    宪法草案规定公民基本权利和义务的第七章在全民讨论期间引起了最大的兴趣，同时也获得普遍热烈的赞成。
    制宪委员会在制订宪法草案的整个过程中，始终遵循着社会主义民主主义的原则。我认为正是因为这个主要原因，所以劳动大众在全国讨论波兰共和国宪法草案的时候立刻就认为并且感觉到这个宪法是自己的作品。
    波兰共和国宪法草案不仅在国内、而且也在国外，不仅在我们的朋友中、也在我们的敌人中引起纷纷讨论。各国资产阶级报纸又在像它们以前谈论其他人民民主国家的宪法一样，冥顽不灵地硬说：这仅仅是一篇不会兑现的宣言而已。这种论调特别表现在谈论关于公民权利的一章上。对这种论调首先可以拿这种论调不过是空洞的废话来回敬，而事实则是：
    （一）公民的劳动权、工作权可以由我们的失业现象已经完全消灭这件事证实，而在资本主义国家内却完全不是这样；
    （二）几年来，波兰的体力和脑力劳动者每年都毫无例外地享受着公民休息权和工资照付的休假；数十万劳动人民都在享用疗养院、休养所，享受着旅行游览等权利。资本主义国家的工人阶级照例是没有这种权利的；
    （三）波兰全国完全由各企业支付的普遍的社会保险这一事实证明了公民享有保健权，这也是资本主义国家所绝对没有的；
    （四）公民有享受教育权，这可由全国城乡儿童普遍受着义务教育的事实证明，而下列数字也可以说明这一点：有三百二十二万儿童在小学里学习，二十三万五千人在中等学校学习，将近五十八万人在职业学校学习，高等学校的数目也同样增加了，
    一九三八年共只二十七所，一九五一年已增到三十二所，学生数目也由四万八千人增到十三万四千人。最后，还有一件事实可作证明：有将近三十二万五千个中学、职业学校和高等学校的学生在领着国家的助学金；
    （五）图书馆、博物馆、戏院、文化宫、电影院和俱乐部的分布网不断地扩大，保证了公民享受文化成果的权利。目前，这些文化机构的数目超过战前许多倍，并且大大超过许多比波兰大得多的资本主义国家；
    （六）妇女有各种权利，她们享受着完全平等的待遇。这一点从宪法规定的各种保障中可以得到证实，而且也早已付之实行了。妇女被提拔担任领导职务的越来越多，而最值得一提的是政府对母亲和婴儿不断地关怀，这可由下列事实看出：新生婴儿的死亡率比战前减低了百分之二十七，儿童死亡率减低了百分之四十—七十（死亡的原因有的是器官亏损、有的是肠胃病及其他内脏病和小儿病），城市产妇死亡率比战前减低了百分之八十七，在乡村则减低了百分之七十三。所有这一切都是由于对母亲和婴儿的医疗帮助增加，托儿所、幼儿园和产科医院的增加。人口的自然增殖率在一九三八年为每一千人十点七人，到一九五○年上升至十九人，即比战前的增殖率上升了百分之七十八。波兰的统计从一九四八年起从来没有见过人口自然增殖达到这么大的数字。人口自然增殖率的上升一方面是由于出生率的增加，另一方面则由于死亡率的减低。这两种现象，无疑问是我国经济、社会改革的结果，而劳动人民的生活水平上升和国家对居民保健事业的关怀是其中决定性的因素。
    波兰法西斯主义的余孽、被历史谴责的贵族和资本家政府的代言人、前途渺茫的不要祖国的世界主义流亡者——美国雇佣的这群吵吵嚷嚷的听差，都异口同声地说我们的宪法草案是苏联宪法的仿制品。这只表明美国听差的伪善和愚蠢。像我们这样
    一个正在建设社会主义的国家，利用社会主义已经胜利的国家所拥有的伟大经验，这是完全自然的事。
    可是，我们的宪法是从波兰土地的深处、从波兰人民的斗争中生长出来的，它实现了波兰人民世世代代的愿望，继承并发展了我们可以自豪的波兰人民最先进的传统，这些也是无可争辩而明显的。人民的波兰宪法之所以有可能制订，完全是因为人类的历史已经发生了转变，而伟大的十月社会主义革命就是这个转变的开始。每个正直的人都很清楚：苏军的击溃希特勒侵略者，给我们取得独立、给人民取得政权、给人民战胜资本主义剥削和腐朽的力量创造了条件。
    宪法草案的序言说：“我们依据着波兰和国际工人运动的革命成果，依据着苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——第一个工农国家——无往不胜的社会主义建设所产生的历史性经验。”我们利用着苏联人民的经验，他们像兄弟一样向我们介绍他们在工业、技术、农业、保健、深刻人道主义的艺术和先进科学各方面所获得的成就，我们因此而感到自豪。同时，我们也深刻地研究我们的历史，将其加以批判地分析，吸取对今天和未来的启示。
    波兰共和国的宪法不仅将巩固我们的成就，并且也为社会主义的完全胜利铺平道路。波兰共和国的宪法将证明我们人民的伟大，证明我们人民历史上的进步运动持久的胜利，证明工人阶级和工农联盟事业的胜利。波兰共和国宪法一经议会通过后，就将成为我们人民争取我们祖国——波兰共和国的繁荣和壮大的斗争中的利盾和武器。（新华社据塔斯社华沙二十日讯）。（附图片）
