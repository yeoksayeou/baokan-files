Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, July 13th: The Thirteenth Universal Postal Congress, which opened in Brussels on May 14th, closed on July 11th. Ninety-four countries participated in the congress, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as various People's Democratic countries. The congress discussed and passed resolutions regarding adjustments to postal rates and other matters.

At the closing meeting, the congress elected an Executive and Liaison Committee composed of twenty countries. Representatives from the Soviet Union and Poland were elected to this committee as representatives of Eastern Europe and North Asia. The next Universal Postal Congress is scheduled to be held in Ottawa, Canada, in 1957.

When signing the documents adopted by the congress, the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus issued a statement saying that they considered it illegal for the congress to allow Kuomintang elements to represent China and for the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government to represent Korea in signing the Universal Postal Convention. The statement by the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus solemnly pointed out that only the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China are the legitimate representatives of China. The People's Republic of China has extensive postal connections, and without its participation, it is impossible to solve the problem of international mail exchange. The statement also pointed out that the congress had no reason to prohibit the government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the work of the congress and signing the Universal Postal Convention. The representatives of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania, who attended the Universal Postal Congress, agreed with this statement.

At a meeting held on July 12th, the Executive and Liaison Committee elected the representative of Belgium as chairman, and the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Australia, Egypt, and other countries as vice-chairmen.

    第十三届万国邮政大会闭幕
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔十三日讯：五月十四日在布鲁塞尔开幕的万国邮政联盟第十三届万国邮政大会，已在七月十一日闭幕。参加大会的有九十四个国家，包括苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯及各人民民主国家在内。大会讨论并通过了有关调整邮资等事项的决议。
    大会在闭幕会议上选出了由二十个国家组成的执行及联络委员会。苏联和波兰代表作为东欧及北亚的代表被选入这个委员会。万国邮政联盟下届代表大会定于一九五七年在加拿大的渥太华举行。
    苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯的代表团在签署大会通过的文件时发表声明说，它们认为大会让国民党分子代表中国、让南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府来代表朝鲜在万国邮政公约上签字，是非法的。苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表团的声明郑重指出：只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表才是合法的中国代表，中华人民共和国有着广泛的邮政联系，没有它参加，就无法解决国际邮件交换的问题。这个声明同时指出：大会毫无理由地禁止德意志民主共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府参加大会的工作和签订万国邮政公约。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚等国出席万国邮政大会的代表都同意这个声明。
    执行及联络委员会在七月十二日举行的会议上选出比利时代表为主席，苏联、美国、澳大利亚、埃及等国代表为副主席。
