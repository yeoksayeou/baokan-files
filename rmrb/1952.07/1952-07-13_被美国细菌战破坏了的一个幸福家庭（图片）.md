A Happy Family Destroyed by American Bacteriological Warfare
Jiang Ying Painting

Sixteen, Fu Jinhua immediately felt cold from head to toe. She fainted! Their happy life had just begun, but her husband was dead!

Seventeen, The not-yet-fully-understanding child, Xiao Lijun, asked, "Will Daddy come back even if he's dead?" When she learned that Daddy "will never come back!" she remembered how Daddy used to come home from work, and Mommy would bring out hot meals; how on Sundays, Daddy would take her and Mommy to the store to buy toys and candy, and to the park... She cried!

Eighteen, After Yan Zongyao's body was taken to the China Medical University, Professor Li Peilin of the Department of Pathology performed an autopsy and proved that he was infected with acute infectious encephalitis. This type of encephalitis has never occurred in China before. But today, Professor Li has also successively autopsied several other people who died from this encephalitis. This is clearly the result of the American imperialists' bacteriological warfare. A happy family was thus destroyed! After this news spread to the factory, a large-scale anti-bacteriological warfare movement and production movement were launched simultaneously. (The End)

    被美国细菌战破坏了的一个幸福家庭
    江荧  画
    十六、富金华立刻手脚全凉了。她晕倒了！幸福的生活刚刚开头，可是丈夫死了！
    十七、还不十分懂事的孩子小丽君问：“爸爸死了还回不回来呢？”当她知道爸爸“永远不会回来了！”时，她想起以前爸爸下班回来，妈妈把热气腾腾的饭菜端上来；星期日爸爸抱着她和妈妈一起到商店去买玩具、糖果、逛公园……。她哭了！
    十八、严宗尧的尸体被抬到中国医科大学之后，经病理学系李佩琳教授解剖检查，证明是染急性传染性脑炎。这种脑炎在中国从来没有发生过。可是今天，李教授还接连解剖检查过好些患这种脑炎死的人。这显然是美帝国主义进行细菌战的结果。一个幸福的家庭便这样被破坏了！这个消息传到工厂以后，一个规模宏大的反细菌战运动和生产运动，同时展开了。    （完）
