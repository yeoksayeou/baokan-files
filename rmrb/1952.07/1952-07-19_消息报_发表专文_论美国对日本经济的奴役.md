Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): Kudryavtsev, based on materials provided in a so-called white paper recently published in Japan regarding Japan's foreign trade, wrote an article in "Message News" pointing out the disastrous consequences brought to Japan by the enslavement of the Japanese economy by American monopoly capital.

Kudryavtsev wrote: The United States, at the expense of Japan's national interests, stubbornly refuses to allow Japan to trade with China (in the past, this market supplied Japan with a large portion of its industrial raw materials and food, while also absorbing a large amount of Japanese exports). Therefore, Japan today has to import large quantities of goods from the United States. At the same time, the United States restricts the import of goods from Japan in every possible way. Thus, the United States has caused Japan to lose the Chinese market, but has offered no compensation for this forced loss. As a result, in 1951, the total value of goods imported by Japan from the dollar area reached 1.2 billion US dollars, while only 320 million US dollars worth of goods were exported. According to preliminary official materials, in 1952, the total value of goods imported from the dollar area will reach 900 million US dollars, while the total value of exported goods will be only 300 million US dollars.

Kudryavtsev continued: In light of these facts, which have had such serious disastrous effects on Japan, the words of the representatives of the American ruling class that Japan has benefited from the development of war industries and military orders from the American Far East Command are simply ridiculous.

According to figures from the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, the total value of orders received by the Japanese war industry from the American Command from the beginning of the Korean War to mid-May 1952 was 500 million US dollars. In addition, Japan received approximately 176 million US dollars for providing "labor services" to the American occupation forces. At the same time, in just two years, Japan's foreign trade deficit with the dollar area will reach 1.48 billion US dollars!

Kudryavtsev said: Therefore, American monopoly capitalists are using the method of using dollars as bait to tie Japan to their chariot, and they are earning much more money than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on war orders to Japan.

### “消息报”发表专文  论美国对日本经济的奴役

    “消息报”发表专文
    论美国对日本经济的奴役
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：库德里雅夫采夫根据最近在日本发表的关于日本对外贸易的所谓白皮书上面提供的材料，在“消息报”上撰文指出由于美国垄断资本对日本经济的奴役给日本带来的灾难性的后果。
    库德里雅夫采夫写道：美国在损害日本民族利益的情况下，硬不叫日本和中国进行贸易（在过去，这个市场曾供给日本很大部分的工业原料和粮食，同时吸收大量的日本出口货物），因此，日本今天不得不从美国输入大批货物。同时，美国却从各方面来限制从日本入口的货物。因此，美国使日本失掉了中国市场，却对日本这种被迫遭到的损失毫无补偿。由于这样，日本在一九五一年间从美元地区输入的货物总值达十二亿美元，而仅仅输出了价值三亿二千万美元的货物。根据官方的初步材料，在一九五二年间从美元地区输入的货物总值将达九亿美元，而输出的货物总值将仅为三亿美元。
    库德里雅夫采夫继续指出：从这些对日本产生如此严重灾难的事实来看，美国统治阶级的代表们所说日本从战争工业的发展和美国远东司令部的军事定货获得了利益的一些话，实在太滑稽了。
    根据日本经济安定本部的数字，日本战争工业从朝鲜战争开始到一九五二年五月中旬期间从美国司令部得到的定货总值为五亿美元。此外，日本在对美国占领军供给“劳务”方面得到了约一亿七千六百万美元。同时，仅仅在两年中，日本与美元地区进行的对外贸易的逆差即将达十四亿八千万美元！
    库德里雅夫采夫说：因此，美国垄断资本家正在以美元为饵的方法把日本拴在他们的战车上，他们所赚的钱比在对日本的战争定货上用掉的几亿美元却多得多。
