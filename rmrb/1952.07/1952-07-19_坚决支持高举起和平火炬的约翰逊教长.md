    Resolutely Support Reverend Johnson, Who Holds High the Torch of Peace
    Huaibei Christian Congregational Church Pastor Wang Zizhong
    Reverend Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury in England, recently visited our country for seven weeks. He personally went to the Northeast and saw the evil facts of the United States conducting bacteriological warfare in the Northeast. I also told the old Archbishop about the evidence and testimony I personally witnessed in Korea of the United States conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. This is a righteous act that every upright Christian should do, and I will continue to testify for the truth. When Reverend Johnson passed through each of our cities (such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Changsha...), local Christian leaders and the vast number of believers all denounced the crimes of the United States conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare on Chinese and Korean soil. China's 700,000 peace-loving Christians want to entrust Reverend Johnson to tell the British people and British Christians our firm belief in loving peace and opposing aggressive war, and to expose to the world the most cruel and inhumane heinous crimes of the United States using bacteriological warfare to destroy humanity, so that every upright Christian in the world can unanimously bear great and powerful witness for justice, love, and truth, and strive for a common peaceful and happy life for mankind.
    After returning to his country, Reverend Johnson, in the heroic and courageous spirit of a Christian daring to testify for the truth, made a statement at a press conference in London on July 8th, and on the 10th, he issued a statement in response to the slanderous remarks of newspapers serving the British rulers. He listed irrefutable evidence, exposing and condemning the crimes of the United States conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and our country. The British rulers attempted to intimidate Reverend Johnson's righteous actions with violence; they vainly attempted to continue to deceive and blind the vast number of British people and believers by suppressing the evidence; this series of shameful actions by the British rulers is intolerable to us justice-loving Christians; as a pastor, an unstoppable fire of anger burns in my heart.
    The reactionary British rulers are willing to be accomplices to the US imperialist crimes of bacteriological warfare and shamelessly echo the wild lies of the US imperialists. I want to warn the reactionary British rulers: "You brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth."
    We firmly support Reverend Johnson's righteous actions, and his prophetic voice will be supported and loved by righteous Christians all over the world. "Deceitful lies cannot cover up the facts written in blood." Reverend Johnson's high-held torch of peace will surely illuminate the dark world created by the warmongers. We have unshakable faith: the peace-loving British people and believers will surely awaken in the face of undeniable facts and, under the call of Reverend Johnson, carry out a heroic and resolute struggle for the solemn cause of human peace; the lies of the American and British warmongers will be swept away from our solemn living realm like autumn leaves. Let Chinese and British Christians, and all peace-loving Christians around the world, strive to defend human peace and a happy life! Peace must be saved, and peace will surely triumph!

    坚决支持高举起和平火炬的约翰逊教长
    华北基督教公理会牧师  王梓仲
    英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊最近在我们祖国参观访问七个星期，他亲自到了东北，看见美国在东北进行细菌战的罪恶事实；我也将自己在朝鲜亲身见到的美国向中朝人民进行大规模细菌战的人证物证告诉了老教长，这是每一个正直的基督徒所应有的公义行为，我仍要继续为真理作见证。约翰逊教长经过我们每一个城市时（如上海、武汉、杭州、长沙……等）当地基督教领袖们和广大教徒们对美国在中朝国土上进行大规模的细菌战的罪行，都提出了控诉。中国七十万爱好和平的基督徒，要托付约翰逊教长将我们爱好和平反对侵略战争的坚定信念，并将美国以细菌战来毁灭人类的最残酷的反人道的滔天罪行，告诉英国人民和英国基督徒，让全世界每一个正直的基督徒一致地为公义、慈爱和真理作伟大而有力的见证，为人类共同的和平幸福生活而努力。
    约翰逊教长回国后，就本着基督徒敢于为真理作见证的英勇果敢精神，在七月八日伦敦记者会上发表了谈话，十日又发表了答复为英国统治者服务的报纸的诬蔑声明，他列举了无可辩驳的罪证，揭露并控诉美国在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的罪行。英国统治者企图以暴力来威吓约翰逊教长的公义行为；他们妄想用扣压罪证来继续欺骗蒙蔽英国广大人民和教徒；英国统治者这一系列的可耻行动，是我们爱好公义的基督徒所不能容忍的；作为一个牧师，我心头燃烧起无可遏止的怒火。
    英国的反动统治者们，甘心做美帝国主义细菌战罪行的帮凶，还厚颜无耻地附和美帝国主义者的漫天大谎。我要警告英国的反动统治者们：“你们这些蛇类毒蛇之种啊！怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？所以我差遣先知和智慧人并文士到你们这里来，有的你们要杀害，要钉十字架，有的你们要在会堂里鞭打，从这城追逼到那城，叫世上所流义人的血，都归到你们身上。”
    我们坚决支持约翰逊教长的正义行为，他的先知的声音将得到全世界正义的基督徒的拥护和爱戴。“欺骗的谎言，掩盖不住血写的事实。”约翰逊教长高举起和平的火炬，必将照遍战争贩子所制造的黑暗世界。我们有着不可动摇的信心：爱好和平的英国人民和教徒，在千真万确的事实前，一定清醒觉悟过来，为人类庄严的和平事业，在约翰逊教长的号召下，进行英勇坚决的斗争；美英战争贩子的谎言，将同秋天的落叶，在我们庄严的生活领域中扫除。让中英两国和全世界爱好和平的基督徒，为保卫人类和平和幸福生活而努力！和平必须拯救，和平一定胜利！    （新华社）
