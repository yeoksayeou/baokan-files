Editor's Note: After the publication of Comrade Wang Yuhu’s article “The Hardworking and Simple Division Commander Cheng Yuechang,” the vast number of readers were moved by Division Commander Cheng Yuechang’s hardworking and simple style. The Xi'an Mass Daily specially invited Division Commander Cheng Yuechang to write an article to explain how his hardworking and simple style was formed and maintained under the cultivation and education of the Party. We are now reprinting it here. Division Commander Cheng Yuechang was promoted to army commander of a certain army in March of this year.

The great victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. It was achieved by thousands upon thousands of outstanding Communist Party members and revolutionary martyrs who, with unparalleled heroism, overcame numerous difficulties rarely seen in the world, and shed their blood and sacrificed their lives. Therefore, a hardworking and simple style should be a noble quality that every Communist Party member and every revolutionary soldier must possess.

Comrade Wang Yuhu wrote about my hardworking and simple style, which I really don't deserve. The more I think about it, the more I feel that it is still far from enough. I have received the Party and the people's patient cultivation and education for twenty-three years, and the care of the people of the motherland for me is meticulous. My little achievement is really nothing. Hard work and simplicity are qualities that revolutionary soldiers should have, and they are not worth praising. Moreover, after the national victory, after strict self-examination, I was, without exception, influenced by bourgeois ideology, and did not wage a resolute struggle against these influences. Measured by the noble qualities of a Communist Party member and a revolutionary soldier, especially as a responsible Party member and soldier, I feel very ashamed. Some comrades who returned from inside the customs said how well the cadres were taken care of by the organizations inside the customs, with a pack of cigarettes every day and sometimes pocket money. Another cadre who returned from a certain army said: "Our division-level cadres are not as good as other people's regimental-level cadres. They really look like leaders, you are too unlike." I opposed these statements at the time; but over time, I changed from opposition to sympathy, and sometimes even used my power to satisfy these people's wrong demands. At the same time, I also had serious bureaucratic style in my work. Since entering Xinjiang two years ago, in production, due to my lack of investigation and research, I did not do a good job of going deep into the troops to supervise and inspect, and my understanding of the military region's construction intentions was very poor. Last year, I mechanically implemented the eight-hour production system, which caused unnecessary losses in production and construction. For example, some personnel in the organs I led had corruption, which I had not noticed before, which fully demonstrated my lack of a strong sense of responsibility.

I was born into a peasant family. There were nine people in my family. During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, my eldest brother (a Communist Party member) and second brother were killed by the Kuomintang, my house was burned down, and my mother was forced to flee to my nephew's house. At that time, I had already joined the Communist Youth League. My mother often taught me: "You must remember how your brother and several uncles in the village died, you must take revenge!" In 1929, the guerrillas and the Red Army joined forces and were formally reorganized into the Red Army. From then on, I officially became a revolutionary soldier fighting for justice. In 1937, due to the formation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front after the "December 12th" Incident, the Red Army was renamed the "Eighth Route Army." The flags, clothes, hats, and armbands were all changed. At that time, I wrote a letter to my mother about this. Because I did not write very clearly in the letter, my mother wrote back to question me: "You were originally the Red Army, why are you flying the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun?" And she repeatedly told me: "Remember, your hearts are red!" These words of my mother were deeply imprinted in my heart, enhancing my work enthusiasm and fighting will.

In the twenty-three years under the education and cultivation of the Party, I have been promoted from a soldier to my current position. I have personally experienced that the qualities of revolutionary soldiers are great and lovely. Their lives are the most difficult and simple. For the victory of the people of the whole country, they are loyal and dedicated, charging into battle, facing life and death. After they entered Xinjiang, they put down their backpacks and started the great construction of the motherland's border areas. In the deserted Gobi Desert and grasslands, without wood, they built houses with reeds to solve their accommodation problems; without shoes, they made nests out of cowhide to replace them, and took up tools to reclaim land barefoot; without firewood to burn, they exchanged oil shale to burn; without vegetables to eat, they drank salt water. During the bandit suppression process, the troops passed through 500 miles of deserted Gobi Desert, and had no drinking water for three days and nights. The soldiers fainted, got up and continued walking. More than 70% of the soldiers drank horse blood and horse urine to quench their thirst. Finally, they overcame such a difficult environment, crossed the Gobi Desert, and annihilated the enemy. The heroic spirit of the soldiers and the heroic miracles they created constantly educated me.

More importantly, in many years of work, the hardworking, simple, and honest style of many responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee deeply moved me and gave me very profound education. I remember when I returned to Yan'an for study in 1940, Political Commissar Xu Liqing asked me to go with him to see Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The three of us went to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's residence in Wangjiaping together. On the way, I thought that Commander-in-Chief Zhu's house must be better; but when I walked in, I saw that he lived in an ordinary cave dwelling, with only four small stools in the room. He himself was wearing coarse cloth cotton clothes and a felt hat. In 1947, when Hu Zongnan's bandit army attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Chairman Mao stayed in northern Shaanxi to direct the people of the whole country in the Liberation War, and at the same time directly directed us to annihilate the invading Hu Zongnan's bandit army. In August 1947, after we annihilated Hu bandits' 123rd Brigade, Chairman Mao personally rode a horse to the front-line headquarters, convened a cadre meeting, and encouraged us to continue our efforts and resolutely eliminate the enemy. I remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, in the Taihang area behind enemy lines, Commander Liu Bocheng came to my regiment to inspect the work. At that time, we fried three dishes to entertain him. Commander Liu Bocheng taught us: "These dishes were all bought with the soldiers' food money. The soldiers get up every day to train and fight, and they are the most hardworking; we should not eat so well. In the future, when I come, don't prepare other dishes, I will eat what the soldiers eat." Commander Wang Zhen of the Xinjiang Military Region also lives a very simple life. He wears the same clothes as ordinary soldiers. In addition to receiving the things stipulated by the national supply standard, he never takes a little more from the public. Commander Wang Zhen personally went to various troops to inspect the work, and he always patiently persuaded and educated us from all aspects. The Party's cultivation and education, the inspiration of the great people's leaders and leaders at all levels, and the noble virtues of the hardworking and simple heroic soldiers all had a profound impact on me. I often think: Why are they fighting so hard? Isn't it for the people? Therefore, I think that asking for enjoyment is letting down Chairman Mao and our leaders and all the commanders and fighters. Especially whenever I encounter certain problems that I can't figure out, I read "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists." In this book, Comrade Liu Shaoqi taught us: Communist Party members should "endure hardship before enjoyment, not compare themselves with others in terms of enjoyment, but compare themselves with others in terms of the amount of revolutionary work and hard struggle."

In this way, I have further strengthened my confidence in overcoming difficulties and completing tasks.

The great "Three-Anti" Movement is not only a profound and powerful movement to consolidate the army and the Party, but also an important key to building a strong national defense force and economic force. The "Three-Anti" struggle has educated me and made me further understand and realize that the revolutionary cause of the people of the motherland is long-term and arduous. As Chairman Mao taught us: Today's victory is "only the first step in a long march of thousands of miles." Therefore, in the future, we must make the greatest efforts to defend the motherland, build the motherland, smash the US imperialist ambition to expand the war of aggression, and carry out large-scale economic construction. To this end, we must maintain and carry forward the hardworking and courageous fighting style of our Party and our army, our tenacious business study style, and always be vigilant against the attack of bourgeois ideology and the growth of individual non-proletarian ideological consciousness. Because my cultural level and theoretical level are very low, I am determined to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the future, improve my leadership ability, and strive to study business in actual work to ensure the completion of the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people of the motherland. In short, I want to continue to improve myself, transform myself, and be willing to always be a loyal soldier of Chairman Mao. (Originally published in Xi'an Mass Daily on July 1)

    永远作毛主席的一个忠实战士
    程悦长
    编者按：王玉胡同志所作“坚苦朴素的程悦长师长”一文发表后，广大读者都为程悦长师长的坚苦朴素作风所感动。西安群众日报特约程悦长师长写了一篇文章，以说明他的坚苦朴素作风是如何在党的培养教育下形成和保持下来的。现在把它转载在这里。程悦长师长已于本年三月升任某军军长。
    中国革命的伟大胜利，是在党和毛主席英明领导下得来的，是千千万万的优秀共产党员和革命烈士们，以无比的英雄气概，克服人间罕见的重重困难，抛头颅洒热血得来的。所以，坚苦朴素的作风，应该是每个共产党人和每个革命战士必须具备的高贵品质。
    王玉胡同志写我的坚苦朴素作风，我实在不敢当。自己越思考，越觉得还很不够。我受了党和人民二十三年的耐心培养教育，祖国人民对我的照顾是无微不至的，我那一点成绩实在算不了什么。坚苦朴素是革命军人应该具有的品质，不值得表扬。再说全国胜利后，严格地检讨起来，我也毫无例外地受到资产阶级思想的影响，对这些影响没有作坚决的斗争，拿共产党员和革命军人的高贵品质来衡量，尤其是作为一个负责的党员和军人，我是感到很惭愧的。有些同志从关内回来说，关内组织上对干部照顾得如何好，每天一盒烟，有时还发零用钱。另外有一个干部从某军回来说：“我们一个师级干部还不如人家一个团级干部。人家真像个首长，你们太不像了。”这些说法，当时我是反对的；但是久而久之，自己也就由反对变为同情，有时竟利用职权来满足这些人的错误的要求。同时，我在工作中也存在着严重的官僚主义作风。进入新疆两年以来，在生产中，由于我缺乏调查研究，没有很好地深入部队督促检查，对军区建设意图领会很差，去年机械地执行了生产八小时制，造成了生产建设上不应有的损失。又如自己所领导的机关，有一些人员有贪污行为，自己从前未发觉，这充分地表现了责任心不强。
    我出生于一个农民家庭。家里共有九口人。在第一次国内革命战争时，我大哥（共产党员）、二哥均被国民党杀了，家里的房子被烧毁，我母亲被迫逃到外甥家里。那时，我已参加了共产主义青年团。母亲常教导我说：“你记住你哥哥和村里几个叔叔怎样死的，你要报仇！”一九二九年游击队和红军会合了，并正式改编为红军。从此，我正式成了一个为正义而战的革命战士。一九三七年，因“双十
    二”事变后抗日民族统一战线的组成，红军改为
    “八路军”，打的旗子，穿的衣服，戴的帽子、袖章，都改换了。当时，我把这事写信告诉母亲。因信上没有写得十分清楚，母亲来信质问我：“你们原来是红军，为什么打着青天白日的旗子？”并再三嘱咐着：“要记住，你们的心是红的！”母亲这些话，都深深地印在我的心里，增强了我的工作积极性和战斗意志。
    二十三年来，在党的教育培养下，我由战士被提升到现职。我自己亲身体会到：革命战士的品质，是伟大的、可爱的。他们生活最艰苦，最朴素，为了全国人民的胜利，忠心耿耿，冲锋陷阵，出死入生。他们进入新疆后，放下背包，就开始了伟大的祖国边疆建设。他们在荒无人烟的戈壁和草原上，没有木材，用苇子搭起房子解决了自己的住宿问题；没有鞋子，用牛皮做成窝子代替，打着赤脚拿起砍土工具便开荒；没有烧的柴火，就换油页岩来烧；吃不上菜，就喝盐水。在剿匪过程中，部队通过五百里荒无人烟的戈壁，三昼夜全无饮水，战士们昏倒了爬起来再走，百分之七十以上的战士喝马血、马尿解渴。终于战胜了这样艰苦的环境，渡过了戈壁，歼灭了敌人。战士们的这种英雄气概，和他们所创造的英雄奇迹，不断地教育着我。
    更其重要的，是在多年的工作中，许多党中央负责同志坚苦朴素和廉洁奉公的作风，深深地感动了我，给我非常深刻的教育。记得一九四○年我回延安学习时，徐立清政委叫我同他去看朱总司令。我们三个人一同到总司令部驻地王家坪去时，我在路上想，朱总司令的房子一定好一些；可是我走进去一看，他住的是普通窑洞，屋里只摆着四个小凳子，自己穿的是粗布棉衣，戴的是毡子做的帽子。一九四七年胡宗南匪军进攻陕甘宁边区时，毛主席一直留在陕北，指挥着全国人民进行解放战争，同时直接指挥我们消灭进犯的胡宗南匪军。一九四七年八月当我们把胡匪一二三旅消灭以后，毛主席亲自骑着马来到前线指挥部，召开干部会议，鼓励我们再接再厉，坚决消灭敌人。记得抗日战争时期，在敌后太行区，一次刘伯承司令员来我团检查工作。当时我们炒了三个菜招待他。刘伯承司令员教导我们说：“这些菜都是战士们的菜金买的，战士们天天起来练兵打仗，最辛苦；我们不应该吃得这样好。以后我来时，不要另外准备菜，战士吃什么，我就吃什么。”新疆军区王震司令员，他的生活也是非常朴素的，他穿的和普通战士一样。他除了领取国家供给标准所规定的东西外，从来不多向公家领取一点东西。王震司令员亲自到各部队检查工作，他总是耐心地从各方面说服教育我们。党的培养教育，伟大人民领袖和各级首长的感召，英雄战士的坚苦朴素的高贵品德，都对我有深刻影响。我经常想：他们这样坚苦奋斗是为什么？还不是为人民吗？因此，我认为要求享受，那就是对不起毛主席和我们的首长及全体指战员。尤其每当我遇到某些问题想不通时，我就看“论共产党员的修养”。在这本书上，刘少奇同志教导我们：共产党员要“吃苦在前，享福在后，不与别人计较享受的优劣，而与别人计较革命工作的多少和艰苦奋斗”。
    这样，就使得我更加增强了克服困难、完成任务的信心。
    伟大的“三反”运动，不仅是一次深刻的有力的整军整党运动，并成为建设强大国防力量和经济力量的重要关键。“三反”斗争教育了我，使我进一步领会和认识了祖国人民的革命事业是长期的、艰苦的。正如毛主席教导我们的：今天的胜利“只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。”因而，今后我们必须以最大的努力，保卫祖国，建设祖国，粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的野心，开展大规模的经济建设。为此，必须保持和发扬我党我军坚苦奋斗、英勇善战、顽强钻研业务的作风，时刻警惕资产阶级思想的进攻和个人非无产阶级思想意识的滋长。因为我的文化水平和理论水平都很低，今后决心加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，提高领导能力，在实际工作中努力钻研业务，保证完成党和祖国人民交给我们的光荣任务。总之，我要继续提高自己，改造自己，愿意永远作毛主席的一个忠实战士。    （原载七月一日西安群众日报）
