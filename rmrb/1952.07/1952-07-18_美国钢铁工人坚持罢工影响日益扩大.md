Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 17th: The national steelworkers' strike in the United States, which began on June 2nd, is still ongoing after nearly seven weeks. This is one of the most impactful steel strikes in American history, causing a weekly loss of two million tons of steel in the US. According to US officials, the total number of workers nationwide who have stopped working due to the steelworkers' strike, including the striking steelworkers themselves, has reached 2.15 million. The strike has affected many important industrial sectors, including the inability to complete production or expansion plans in the most important military production sectors.

Negotiations broke down again on the 15th because the steel capitalists refused to meet the workers' reasonable demands. The union is demanding that a union shop clause be included in the new contract. This clause is particularly important for the steelworkers' union because large steel companies have hired non-union workers to break strikes when workers are on strike. The company refused this condition in an attempt to undermine workers' unity. On the issue of wages, the company also insisted on raising steel prices as a condition. That is to say, all the increased wage costs would be passed on to consumers, including the steelworkers. It is reported that in order to ensure that the company's profits continue to increase, the Truman administration has agreed with company representatives to raise the price of steel by $5 per ton. This will increase the steel industry's annual revenue by more than $500 million.

At the same time as the steelworkers' strike, the strike of West Coast seamen belonging to the Pacific Waterfront Union of the AFL, which began at the end of May, has persisted for nearly two months. The workers are striking to demand increased wages, overtime pay, and more employment opportunities. The strike has paralyzed about 100 ships in West Coast ports. The canned fruit industry in California is in danger of shutting down completely because the imported raw sugar cannot be unloaded.

Strike news also continues to come from the US government's top military sector—the so-called atomic energy plant. Ironworkers building an atomic energy plant in Alamosa, New Mexico, went on strike on the 15th to demand increased wages, completely halting all construction work.

In addition, strikes have recently occurred at General Electric, which manufactures jet aircraft, Ford Motor Company, which manufactures tanks and armored vehicles, and the three major US broadcasting companies.

### 美国钢铁工人坚持罢工影响日益扩大

    美国钢铁工人坚持罢工影响日益扩大
    【新华社十七日讯】华盛顿消息：六月二日开始的美国全国钢铁工人大罢工，迄今仍在坚持中，前后已将近七个星期。这是美国历史上影响最大的一次钢铁罢工。罢工使美国每周损失二百万吨钢。据美国官方人士说，全国因钢铁工人罢工而停止工作的工人，包括罢工中的钢铁工人在内，总数已达二百一十五万人。罢工已影响到许多重要的工业部门，包括最重要的军事生产部门的生产或扩充计划不能完成。
    由于钢铁业的资本家拒绝工人们提出的合理要求，谈判在十五日又一次宣告破裂。工会要求在新合同中加入雇工义务入会的条款。这个条款对于钢铁工人工会特别重要，因为大钢铁公司在工人罢工时曾雇用非工会会员的工人破坏罢工。公司方面拒绝了这个条件，以图破坏工人的团结。在工资问题上，公司方面也坚持要以提高钢价为条件。就是说把增加的工资支出全部转嫁到消费者包括钢铁工人在内的身上。据悉，为了保证公司的利润有增无减，杜鲁门政府已与公司代表协议每吨钢涨价五美元。这将使钢铁业每年增加流水收入五亿美元以上。
    与钢铁工人罢工同时，五月底开始的劳联太平洋水手工会所属西海岸海员的罢工，迄今已坚持将近两月。工人们罢工是为了要求增加工资和超时工资以及更多的就业。罢工使西海岸各港口的船只瘫痪了约一百艘。加利福尼亚州的罐头水果工业因运来的粗糖无法启卸，已有全部关门之虞。
    罢工的消息也继续来自美国政府第一位的军火部门——所谓原子能工厂。新墨西哥州阿拉摩萨市建筑原子能工厂的铁工为要求增加工资于十五日举行罢工，全部建筑工程完全陷于停顿。
    除此而外，在制造喷气飞机的奇异电气公司，制造坦克及装甲汽车的福特汽车公司以及美国三大广播公司，最近都曾发生罢工。
