    Hoping to Promote the Two-Handed Welding Method
    Comrade Editor: Li Shan, a welder at the state-owned Tangshan Machinery Factory, has successfully learned the Soviet two-handed welding method, increasing work efficiency by 40%, saving welding rods and electroplating costs by more than 30% each, and improving the quality of the welding (the welded work is more resilient). I hope that relevant departments can promote this experience. If all the welders in Tangshan City were to learn this, they could save 250,000 jin of millet per month. If all the welders in the country were to learn the two-handed welding method, the wealth created for the country through increased production and savings would be even greater.

    希望推广双手电焊法
    编辑同志：公营唐山机器厂电焊工人李山，学习苏联双手电焊法成功，提高工作效率百分之四十，节省焊条及电镀费各百分之三十以上，并且提高了焊活的质量（焊出来的活富有韧性）。我希望有关部门能推广这一经验。唐山市的电焊工人，如果都来学习，每月可以节省二十五万斤小米。如果全国电焊工人都学习双手电焊法，为国家增产节约的财富就更多了。              刘连岐
