    Soldiers Guarding the Border and Defending the Country
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Wenhui Wang Chen
    In the hot July, the temperature in the Tarim Basin has risen to about 35 degrees Celsius, and luscious grapes and melons are on the market in Kashgar City (Shufu County). However, on the national border of the Pamir Plateau, the "roof of the world," the daytime temperature is around 10 degrees Celsius, and it drops to zero degrees at night. The "Alichur Pamir," "Wakhan Pamir," "Taghdumbash Pamir," "Great Pamir," and "Small Pamir," which are four to five thousand meters above sea level, are covered with snow all year round, towering into the sky. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed here wear leather clothes and carry felt tubes all year round, guarding the national defense of the motherland day and night.
    These soldiers guarding the border and defending the country are invincible warriors. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, they fought face-to-face with Japanese invaders on the North China Plain; during the War of Liberation, they chased, surrounded, and annihilated regiments and brigades of the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops on the Northwest battlefield. Since being stationed on the border in 1950, they have paid attention to exercising their physiques every day, riding steeds, climbing snow mountains, and crossing ice rivers. Finally, with their tenacious will, they have overcome the cold and thin air unique to the plateau. Now, every soldier can climb snow mountains of three to four thousand meters in one breath like a tiger, carrying full equipment. Once, soldier Hu Mingqing and two others went to perform a patrol mission and encountered a blizzard on the plateau as soon as they set out. They patrolled for six days in the blizzard. When they were tired, they spread felt on the snow, tied their horses to their legs and slept. When they were hungry, they ate dry food and canned food mixed with snow. They did not return to the army until they had completed their mission. When the reporter interviewed Hu Mingqing, he proudly said: "The wind and snow are not as terrible as people imagine. As long as you have the determination, you can live in the blizzard. When we are patrolling in the blizzard, when we think of Chairman Mao's heroic spirit when he crossed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, our blood boils, and we feel that we are performing the glorious task of defending the motherland." Soldier Zhu Shangyun, in order to perform an urgent patrol mission, walked over nine snow mountains and crossed ten ice rivers in one day. His cotton trousers were half frozen into ice, and the soles of his feet were worn out, but he persisted until he completed the mission.
    Under such harsh natural conditions, the soldiers have arranged their lives very well. The soldiers can get adequate food supply, and they also take turns on their days off to go to the snow mountains to catch wild cattle, argali sheep, and snow chickens to improve their diet. They renovated the barracks so that they are brand new, and they are kept clean inside and out. Stone tables and benches were built in each row of barracks using smooth stone slabs. Every morning, after running or riding horses, they gather here to attend political and cultural classes. Recently, they have been learning culture using the rapid literacy method. Most of the soldiers have learned more than 1,000 characters and have preliminary reading ability. During their break after dinner, the soldiers play poker and chess in the barracks, or learn the songs and dances of the Tajik ethnic group. The reporter interviewed young soldier Feng Shiquan, who is a member of the Communist Youth League. He told the reporter that he recently received a letter from his father from thousands of miles away, saying that during the land reform last winter, his family was allocated a cow and eight mu of land. His father was elected as the village chief, and his younger brother and sister were both in school. The whole family is living a life with enough to eat and wear. His father also specially instructed him in the letter to defend the national defense of the motherland well. He said: The soldiers guarding the border and defending the country deeply realize that defending the national defense of the motherland and defending the people of the whole country is also defending their own families and their own happiness.
    The soldiers guarding the border and defending the country exemplarily abide by the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." They respect the customs and habits of the local Tajik ethnic group and do their best to assist the local people's government in implementing various policies. They helped the masses organize wolf-fighting teams to protect the development of livestock. Herdsman Kurban Hali, with the help of the soldiers, killed more than 90 wolves, foxes, and argali sheep last winter and this spring. In addition to providing food for the whole family, he also exchanged them for more than 4,400 kilograms of flour and wool fabric for the whole family to wear.
    Under the day and night guard of the soldiers, the national border is very stable, and the local Tajik ethnic group is living a peaceful life that has never been seen in history. Livestock are multiplying in large numbers. In the past two years, the number of sheep in Puli County alone has increased from more than 24,500 to more than 51,800. The Tajik people all gratefully say: "Chairman Mao's soldiers, you have defended the motherland and also defended our happy life."
    As the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day is approaching, the soldiers guarding the border and defending the country have written their pledges to perform meritorious service. They assure their superiors that they will resolutely complete the glorious task of defending the national defense of the motherland and will not allow the claws of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to step into the motherland.

    驻守边疆卫国的战士
    新华社记者    韩文慧  王忱
    暑伏的七月，塔里木盆地的气温已经上升到摄氏三十五度左右，丰美的葡萄和甜瓜，都在喀什噶尔城（疏附县城）上市了。但在世界屋脊——帕米尔高原的国境线上，白天的气温在摄氏十度左右，晚上就降到零度。拔海四、五千公尺以上的“阿里楚尔帕米尔”、“瓦罕帕米尔”、“塔格敦巴什帕米尔”、“大帕米尔”、“小帕米尔”整年堆积着皑皑白雪，高耸入天。驻守在这里的中国人民解放军的战士们，终年穿着皮衣，带着毡筒，不分白天黑夜，警卫着祖国的国防。
    这些驻守边疆卫国的战士是无敌的勇士。在抗日战争中，他们曾在华北平原上和日本侵略者面对面地拼过刺刀；在解放战争中，他们曾经在西北战场上追击、包围和歼灭了成团成旅的蒋胡匪军。从一九五零年驻守在国境线以来，他们每天注意锻炼体格，骑骏马，爬雪山，渡冰河，终于在顽强的意志下战胜了高原上特有的寒冷和稀薄的空气。现在每个战士都能像猛虎一样，背着全副武装，一口气爬上三、四千公尺的雪山了。有一次，战士胡明清等三人去执行巡逻任务，刚出发就碰上了高原上的狂风大雪。他们在狂风大雪中巡逻六天，困乏时在雪地上铺起毡子把马拴在自己腿上睡觉；饥饿时就拿干粮、罐头食物和着雪吃起来。他们直到完成任务后才返回部队。当记者访问胡明清的时候，他自豪地说：“风雪并不如人们想像的那样可怕，只要有决心，你就可以在狂风大雪中生活。当我们在狂风大雪中巡逻的时候，一想起了毛主席过雪山草地时的英雄气概，我们的血就沸腾了，感觉到自己是在执行着捍卫祖国的光荣任务。”战士朱尚云，为了执行紧急的巡逻任务，在一天中，徒步翻过了九座雪山，涉过十条冰河。他的半截棉裤都凝成了冰块，脚底也磨破了，但是他坚持到完成任务。
    在这样艰苦的自然条件下，战士们却把自己的生活安排得很周到。战士们能够得到充分的食粮供给，他们还在轮流休假的日子，上雪山去捕捉野牛、大角羊和雪鸡来改善伙食。他们把营房修得崭新，里里外外都打扫得很干净；壁炉里整天生着火，室内保持着春天的温度。他们用光滑的石板，在每排营房内修建了石桌和石凳，每天早晨跑步或溜马以后，他们就聚集在这里上政治课和文化课。最近他们正在用速成识字法学习文化。大部分战士都已认识了一千多个生字，并且有初步阅读能力了。晚饭后的休息时间，战士们就在营房里玩扑克牌和象棋，或者学习塔吉克民族的歌舞。记者访问了青年战士冯世全，他是一个青年团员。他告诉记者说：最近接到万里以外父亲的来信，信上说，去年冬天土地改革时，家里分了一头牛、八亩地，父亲被选为村长，弟弟和妹妹都上了学，全家人都过着有吃有穿的生活了。父亲并在信上特别叮咛他要好好地保卫祖国的国防。他说：驻守边疆卫国的战士都深深地认识到，保卫祖国国防，保卫全国人民也就是保卫着自己的家庭和自己的幸福。
    驻守边疆卫国的战士模范地遵守着“三大纪律、八项注意”。他们十分尊重当地聚居的塔吉克民族的风俗习惯，并且尽力协助当地人民政府执行各项政策。他们帮助群众组织了打狼队，保护牲畜的发展。牧民库尔班哈力，在战士们的帮助下，去冬今春共打狼、狐子、大角羊九十多只，除了供全家食用外，还换到四千四百多斤面粉和全家穿用的毛布。
    在战士们日夜警卫下，国境线上非常安定，当地塔吉克民族过着历史上从来没有过的平静生活。牲畜大量地增殖着。两年来，仅蒲犁县的羊，已由二万四千五百多只增加到五万一千八百多只。塔吉克人民都感激地说：“毛主席的战士，你们保卫了祖国，同时也保卫了我们的幸福生活。”
    当“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念快要到来的时候，驻守边疆卫国的战士们，纷纷写出自己的立功决心书，他们向上级保证：坚决完成保卫祖国国防的光荣任务，不让帝国主义和蒋匪帮的爪牙踏进祖国一步。
