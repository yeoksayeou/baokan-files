Give Play to the Role of Party Organizations in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
Li Zhuoran, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

Since the Northeast Bureau issued the "Resolution on Party Leadership in State-Owned Enterprises" in May of last year, the organizational and political work of the Party in industrial and mining enterprises has made significant progress. The Party organizations in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, together with the trade unions and Communist Youth League under their leadership, have enhanced the political awareness of the working class and unleashed their unparalleled labor enthusiasm in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign to fulfill and exceed the state production plan. Thanks to the creative labor of many advanced producers and engineering technicians, the sincere assistance of Soviet experts, and the learning and application of advanced Soviet experiences by the vast number of employees, as well as the implementation and promotion of tens of thousands of rationalization proposals from the employees, the labor productivity of many of our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises has greatly improved. In terms of product quality, most factories have also shown significant improvements. Furthermore, because the Party organizations in enterprises and the mass organizations under their leadership have carried out education on cherishing state property among the workers, a widespread mass movement has been formed in many industrial and mining enterprises to save raw materials, electricity, fuel, and utilize waste materials, thereby saving a large amount of materials for the state. All of this is the driving force for the victorious fulfillment and exceeding of our national industrial production plan, the important factor for the significant achievements of our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in production management, labor organization, and technological reform, and also the driving force and source of the wealth of 16 million tons of grain increased and saved by our state-owned enterprises last year on the basis of completing the plan, and the 8 million tons of grain to be increased and saved this year. Obviously, the guaranteeing role of the Party organizations in state-owned enterprises is of decisive significance for the victorious completion of these tasks. However, with the commencement of the motherland's large-scale economic construction, our past progress and achievements are only the beginning of this great construction and are far from meeting the needs of the rapid economic development of the motherland. Moreover, our state-owned enterprises still have many shortcomings in production management, labor organization, and technological reform. Our experience is still very insufficient, and the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau on relying on the working class to run factories well and strengthening Party leadership in state-owned enterprises still need to be continuously implemented. The city Party committees and Party organizations in enterprises that lead state-owned enterprises are still very inadequate in how to specifically implement the idea of relying on the working class, implement the policy of combining political work with economic work, earnestly study economic work knowledge, overcome bureaucracy and formalism, establish a style of going deep into production, going deep into reality, closely contacting the masses, strictly observing Party and state discipline, and developing criticism and self-criticism. Although the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has created extremely favorable conditions for us to further solve these problems, the actual solution cannot be achieved overnight and requires arduous and continuous learning and work. Therefore, we must adhere to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, be prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and rashness, keep our eyes downward, work diligently, seek truth from facts, avoid empty talk, and only then can we confidently solve a series of practical problems raised by the above-mentioned aspects. This particularly requires the leading cadres of our state-owned industrial and mining enterprise Party organizations to carefully summarize past work experience and propose effective improvement methods. Here, I would like to offer some immature opinions for reference based on my personal understanding.

I. Concretely Implement the Idea of Relying on the Working Class

The above-mentioned resolution of the Northeast Bureau pointed out: "Relying on the working class is the basic idea of our Party in managing industry and running factories well. All work in enterprises must implement the idea of relying on the working class, and this idea must be clarified among cadres and repeatedly educated." Actual experience proves that this instruction of the Party has aroused widespread attention, and the basic idea of relying on the working class to run factories well has been clarified among most cadres. The production plans of industrial and mining enterprises and the production tasks and workers' welfare undertakings in various periods have all aroused the attention and discussion of the vast number of employees in the enterprises. In some advanced factories, "finding tricks" and "tapping potential" have become mass movements. However, some leading comrades in some industrial and mining enterprises still keep the slogan of relying on the working class to run factories well on their lips and on paper, or only partially implement the slogan, without comprehensively and concretely implementing the slogan in various practical works. For example, education and training of workers to learn business management, doing a good job in production management committees, and boldly cultivating and promoting worker cadres have not yet aroused the due attention of the Party's leadership in many industrial and mining enterprises. For example, although the annual production plan and the production tasks in various periods have been reported and discussed among the employees, the rationalization proposals of the employees have not been sufficiently valued in some industrial and mining enterprises, some even "sink like stones to the bottom of the sea without a trace." Tens of thousands of new tricks have not been studied and summarized in time, so that those that should be promoted have not been well organized for promotion. Even some advanced experiences that have already achieved significant results, such as Li Xikui's shunting method and Su Changyou's bricklaying method, have been widely publicized and adopted far away, but rarely publicized and promoted nearby. The criticisms from the worker masses have not been valued enough, or they have only verbally accepted their criticisms without actually improving the work in the enterprise (including the security and welfare of the employees) based on these criticisms. For example, some Party committees and propaganda and education work cadres still do not pay enough attention to such important things as strengthening the ideological and political education of new employees and educating the vast number of employees with the spirit of communism to inspire the workers' sense of ownership. There is a lack of practical inspection and specific help for the quality and effectiveness of the work of the Party reporters or political instructors in the factories. There is a lack of serious investigation and research on the ideological situation of the employees. The "Three-Anti" movement proved that many serious bourgeois erroneous thoughts and viewpoints in state-owned enterprises in the past have not been criticized in time. This criticism and education work has not aroused enough attention even after the "Three-Anti" movement. The serious shortcomings of neglecting the leading role of the working class existing in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have not been corrected in a timely and effective manner, which shows the weakness of the guaranteeing and supervisory role of the Party organizations in these enterprises. Don't all these shortcomings show that some of our comrades still haven't put the idea of relying on the working class into practice? Now is the time for us to practically check the implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau and further implement these instructions. We must resolutely correct the above-mentioned shortcomings in various aspects, and strengthen the work of educating the vast number of employees with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, because only this kind of education can constantly inspire their high patriotic enthusiasm and thereby launch the endless creative activities of the vast number of workers and engineering technicians on the production front. Of course, at present, the cultural and technical learning of the workers, especially the worker cadres, as well as the education of business knowledge are equally important, but strengthening the ideological and political education of the working class is by no means to hinder or weaken cultural and technical education and business learning, but precisely to promote the activists and the vast number of workers to correctly and actively improve their cultural, technical and professional level, so as to best complete the great construction tasks of the motherland.

II. Further Implement the Policy of Combining Political Work with Economic Work

In the past year, the Party's political work in many industrial and mining enterprises has become lively and powerful because it has been correctly combined with economic work, and the phenomenon of generalization has been corrected. The Party organizations in these enterprises have learned how to specifically study and analyze the ideological status of the employees in various periods in the production movement, grasp the ideological concerns that hinder them from actively taking action, and study why these concerns affect their doubts about the new production slogans and requirements, so as to convene meetings of the Party's grassroots cadres to jointly study how to break these concerns. This makes the Party's political mobilization practical and a powerful weapon to mobilize the masses to actively participate in the production movement. Usually, after this kind of concrete political mobilization, the production enthusiasm of the employees will boil, and certain conservative ideas will be immediately criticized by the masses. For example, "Tricks smile at you, see if you want them or not" and "Tricks run everywhere, see if you can find them" are mobilization slogans put forward by the workers for those who stick to conventions and are not interested in various new tricks and new methods. These slogans are so vivid and powerful that they simply make everyone with conservative ideas unable to stand in front of them and start to use their brains. Comrade Zhang Zhao, director and Party secretary of the Shenyang "May 2nd" Factory, and others provided such experience at the symposium of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau on June 17th, that is, after the factory's production tasks have undergone good political mobilization each time, and after the calls of the Party and the government have been accepted by the masses, new banners of advancement will quickly appear among the masses. At this time, the political work task of the Party organization is to promptly discover and establish this banner as a weapon to promote production competition; after the competition movement begins, the Party's political workers must go deep into the workshops and groups, promptly grasp the new situation, so as to put forward appropriate new mobilization slogans, reward new advanced workers, and criticize certain conservative viewpoints. When this new production task is nearing completion, and workers and technicians have made many new creations in the competition movement, the Party leadership should promptly assist and, through the administrative organization of the enterprise, well summarize the experiences of the employees in improving tools, improving labor organization, and creating new operating methods, and organize practical performances, run training courses, revise the old technical operating procedures based on these new creations and experiences, and thereby improve the management methods of the factory to consolidate the victory of the production competition movement and continue to push the movement forward. I think the experiences of Comrade Zhang Zhao and other comrades show us a concrete process of how the Party's political work in enterprises is combined with economic work, and provides a vivid example. Of course, there must also be advanced experiences in other state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in this regard, especially advanced experiences in improving product quality, but some have not been well summarized. In the future, we must regard summarizing and promoting advanced experiences (including production technology and management methods) as an extremely important task.

When summarizing these experiences, not only should we introduce their successful aspects, but also pay attention to discovering and analyzing the shortcomings and even the lessons of failure. In the speeches at the above-mentioned symposium, several comrades specifically pointed out these shortcomings. For example, the Party's political work in the capital construction department is currently very weak, and there is even a serious phenomenon of universal irresponsibility. In the relatively advanced state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, the tendency of political work to deviate from the actual production situation, relying solely on material rewards, and the lack of propaganda slogans with political and ideological content can also be frequently found. The Party's political workers lack knowledge of economic work and lack Marxist-Leninist cultivation, but some comrades have not yet paid attention to such shortcomings, and have not seriously studied, which shows the seriousness of the problem. In short, all our Party's political workers must guard against complacency, must face up to the shortcomings in their work, and study how to overcome them. Only in this way can we effectively improve the Party's leading role and further implement the Party's policy of combining political work with economic work.

III. Strengthen the Specific Leadership of City Party Committees over Party Organizations in State-Owned Enterprises

In the past year, the Party committees of various cities and industrial and mining areas in Northeast China have improved the Party's leadership over local state-owned enterprises in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau. The situation of irresponsibility for the quality of production in state-owned enterprises as criticized in the above-mentioned instructions of the Northeast Bureau basically no longer exists. Especially after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Party committees have a better understanding of the situation in the local industrial and mining enterprises, and the leadership is more specific. However, due to the rapid development of the national economic construction, the demands of state-owned enterprises on the local Party organizations are also becoming increasingly heavy. For example, to quickly change the current serious situation of extremely weak leadership in capital construction work, we require the Party committees of cities and industrial and mining areas to pay great attention to it, truly follow the instructions of the Northeast Bureau, raise the task of doing a good job in capital construction to the primary position of the Party's leadership work, check and urge the implementation of the recent instructions of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government on strengthening capital construction work, especially to quickly help establish the Party's political work, as well as the work of the trade unions and the Communist Youth League in this department, and appropriately help adjust a group of cadres to establish these works. For example, the cadres of industrial and mining enterprises are currently eager to organize learning to improve their political and theoretical level, but it is not easy to persist due to the lack of effective guidance. The responsible cadres of certain bureaus under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government organized the responsible comrades of their subordinate factories to learn the same way after participating in the weekly political and theoretical learning of senior cadres of the Industrial Department. Experience has proved that this method has very good results. I think this method can also be imitated under the direct leadership of the Party committees of various cities. In short, the Party's work in state-owned enterprises is multi-faceted, but the deployment of all work should be centered on production. The Party's leadership must strive to be specific, avoid the tendency to deviate from the center, go to the site more, understand the work of the Party committees and grassroots organizations in the enterprise departments, help them solve practical problems, and minimize the exchange of documents. The meetings convened above should be prepared and the number of meetings should be reduced as much as possible and the meeting time should be shortened. At the above-mentioned symposium, some comrades criticized the individual local Party committees for not taking care of the production environment of the factories. Various departments went to ask for statistics, ask for materials, and convene meetings, so that they could not cope with it, and even hindered the factory leaders' guidance on production work. This situation should be given special attention and corrected.

In commemorating the great 31st anniversary of our Party, our state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have achieved great achievements under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central People's Government. This achievement has now become the link and driving force driving the progress of our entire national economy. Let us closely unite around Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, thoroughly implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, strengthen learning, comprehensively implement the basic idea of relying on the working class to manage industry and run factories well, give full play to the role of Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises, strive to best complete and exceed the state production plan, improve product quality, and deeply carry out the patriotic competition movement to increase production and save 8 million tons of grain to welcome the upcoming large-scale national economic construction!

    发挥工矿企业中党组织的作用
    中共中央东北局宣传部部长  李卓然
    自从去年五月东北局发布关于党对国营企业领导的决议以后，党在工矿企业中的组织工作和政治工作都已获得了显著的进步。东北国营工矿企业中党的组织及其所领导的工会和青年团，在为完成和超过国家生产计划的爱国增产节约运动中，提高了工人阶级的政治觉悟，发挥了他们无比的劳动热情。由于许多先进生产者和工程技术人员的创造性的劳动，由于苏联专家的真诚帮助和广大职工学习运用苏联先进经验，以及来自职工中的成千成万的合理化建议的实行和推广，已使我们许多国营工矿企业的劳动生产率大大提高了。在产品质量方面多数工厂亦有显著改进。又由于企业中党的组织及其所领导的群众团体在工人群众中进行了爱护国家财产的教育，许多工矿企业在节省原材料、节省电力、燃料及利用废物等方面，已形成了广泛性的群众运动，从而替国家节约了大量的物资。所有这些，就是我们国家工业生产计划得以胜利完成和超过的动力，是我们国营工矿企业在生产管理、劳动组织和技术改革等方面获得了显著成绩的重要因素，也是我们国营企业在完成计划的基础上去年增产节约一千六百万吨粮食的财富和今年又将增产节约八百万吨粮食的动力和泉源。很显然的，这些任务的胜利完成，国营企业中党的组织的保证作用是具有决定意义的。但是随着祖国大规模经济建设的开始，我们过去的进步和成就不过是这伟大建设的开端，还远赶不上祖国经济迅速发展的需要，而且我们国营企业不管在生产管理、劳动组织和技术改革等各方面，还存在着很多缺点。我们的经验还很不够，党中央和东北局关于依靠工人阶级办好工厂和加强党对国营企业领导的指示还有待于继续贯彻。领导国营企业的城市党委和企业中党的组织对于如何具体地贯彻依靠工人阶级的思想，贯彻政治工作与经济工作相结合的方针，以及认真学习经济工作知识，克服官僚主义和形式主义，树立深入生产、深入实际、密切联系群众、严格遵守党和国家的纪律、发展批评与自我批评的作风等，仍然是很不够的。虽然“三反”和“五反”运动的伟大胜利，已为我们进一步解决这些问题创造了极好的条件，但实际的解决仍然不能一蹴而成，还要进行艰苦的不断的学习和工作，因此我们必须恪守毛泽东同志的指示，谨慎谦虚，戒骄戒躁，眼睛向下，埋头苦干，实事求是，不尚空谈，才能有把握地解决由上述各方面所提出来的一系列的实际问题。这就特别要求我们国营工矿企业党的领导干部，仔细总结过去的工作经验，提出有效的改进方法。我在这里只就个人见解所及，提出一些不成熟的意见作为参考。
    一、具体地贯彻依靠工人阶级
        的思想
    上述东北局的决议中指出：“依靠工人阶级是我党管理工业、办好工厂的基本思想。在企业中一切工作都必须贯彻依靠工人阶级的思想，必须在干部中明确这一思想，反复进行教育。”实际情况证明，党的这一指示已引起了普遍的重视，依靠工人阶级办好工厂的基本思想已在大多数干部中明确起来，工矿企业的生产计划和各个时期的生产任务及工人福利事业，都已引起了企业中广大职工的注意和讨论。在一些先进的工厂中，“找窍门”、“挖潜在力”已成为群众性的运动。但也有部分工矿企业中的某些领导同志，仍然是把依靠工人阶级办好工厂的口号停留在口头上、书面上，或者只是部分的实行了这个口号，而没有全面地、具体地把这个口号贯彻到各种实际工作中去。比如教育与培养工人学习经营管理，搞好生产管理委员会，大胆培养与提拔工人干部，这些都还没有引起许多工矿的党的领导方面应有的重视；比如全年的生产计划和各个时期的生产任务，虽然在职工中报告了，讨论了，但职工们的合理化建议在部分工矿企业中并未被足够的重视，有的甚至是“如石沉海底，不明下落”，成千成万的新窍门未能及时地加以研究总结，以致应该推广的没有很好的组织推广，甚至有些业已获得显著成效的先进经验，如李锡奎调车法、苏长有砌砖法，在远处已被广泛的宣传和采用，而在近处反而很少宣传和被推广。对于来自工人群众中的批评，有的重视不够，或者只是口头上接受了他们的批评，而没有根据这种批评去实际地改进企业中的工作（包括职工的保安福利事业）。又如对加强新职工的思想政治教育及用共产主义的精神教育广大职工以启发工人阶级主人翁的自觉这样重要的事情，有些党委和宣传教育工作干部也还是注意不够的；对工厂中党的报告员或政治教员的质量及其工作成效，均缺乏切实检查和具体帮助；对职工中的思想情况，缺乏认真的调查研究。“三反”运动证明了过去在国营企业中许多严重的资产阶级的错误思想和观点，并未受到及时的批判。“三反”运动后这种批判和教育工作也还未引起足够的重视。在国营工矿企业中，所存在的这些忽视工人阶级领导作用的严重缺点，没有得到及时的与有效的纠正，就是表现了这些企业中党组织的保证和监督作用的薄弱。所有上述这些缺点，难道不是说明我们有些同志仍是没有把依靠工人阶级的思想贯彻到实践中去吗？现在已是我们切实检查党中央和东北局指示的执行情况并进一步贯彻这些指示的时候了。我们必须坚决纠正上述各方面的缺点，加强用马克思列宁主义、用毛泽东思想来教育广大职工的工作，因为只有这种教育，才能经常地启发他们高度的爱国主义热情并从而发动广大工人和工程技术人员在生产战线上的无穷无尽的创造性的活动。当然，目前在工人群众中特别是工人干部中的文化技术的学习以及业务知识的教育也均是同样重要的，但加强对工人阶级的思想政治教育，丝毫也不是要去妨碍或减弱文化技术教育和业务学习，而正是为了推动工人中的积极分子及广大工人群众正确地积极地来提高自己的文化、技术和业务水平，以便最好地去完成祖国的伟大建设任务。
    二、进一步地贯彻政治工作与
        经济工作相结合的工作
        方针
    一年来，不少工矿企业中党的政治工作，由于正确地结合了经济工作去进行，已纠正了一般化的现象，使党的政治工作显得生动有力。这些企业中党的组织已经学会如何在生产运动中去具体研究和分析各个时期内职工的思想状况，抓住那些妨碍他们积极行动起来的思想顾虑，研究这些顾虑为什么影响他们对新的生产口号和要求发生怀疑，从而召集党的基层干部开会共同研究如何打破这些顾虑的办法。这样就使得党的政治动员能够切合实际，而成为发动群众积极参加生产运动的有力武器。通常在经过这种具体的政治动员之后，职工的生产热情就会沸腾起来，某些保守思想就会立刻得到群众的批判，比如：“窍门对你笑，看你要不要”、“窍门到处跑，看你找不找”，就是工人们针对着某些墨守成规而对于各种新窍门、新办法不感兴趣的人提出来的动员口号。这种口号如此生动有力，简直要使一切有保守思想的人在它面前站不住脚而开始动起脑筋来。沈阳“五二”工厂的厂长兼党委书记张昭同志等在六月十七日东北局宣传部的座谈会上提供了这样的经验，就是当工厂每次生产任务经过了很好的政治动员之后，当党和政府的号召被群众接受了之后，很快就会在群众中出现新的前进的旗帜，这时候党组织的政治工作任务，就在于及时发现并树立这种旗帜作为推动生产竞赛的武器；在竞赛运动开始后，党的政治工作人员则要深入车间、小组，及时掌握新的情况，以便提出适当的新的动员口号，奖励新的先进者，批判某些保守观点。当着这个新的生产任务接近完成，工人技术人员在竞赛运动中出现了许多新创造的时候，党的领导就要适时地协助和通过企业的行政组织，很好地总结职工们在改进工具、改善劳动组织及创造新的操作方法等方面的经验，并根据这些新的创造和经验组织实际表演，开办训练班，修改旧的技术操作规程，并从而改进工厂的管理方法来巩固生产竞赛运动的胜利并继续把运动推向前进。我觉得张昭同志及其他同志的这些经验，给我们说明了企业中党的政治工作如何与经济工作相结合的一个具体过程，提供了一个生动的范例。当然在这一方面的先进经验特别是提高产品质量方面的先进经验，其他国营工矿企业中也一定是有的，只是有些还没有很好的总结出来，今后我们必须把总结和推广先进经验（包括生产技术及管理方法），当作一种极为重要的工作。
    在总结这些经验的时候，不仅要介绍其成功的方面，而且也要注意发现和分析其中的缺点以至失败的教训。在上述座谈会的发言中，已有几位同志具体地指明了这些缺点。比如目前基本建设部门中党的政治工作是非常薄弱，甚至存在着普遍无人负责的严重现象，在比较先进的国营工矿企业中，政治工作脱离生产实际，单靠物资奖励的偏向，以及缺乏政治思想内容的宣传口号也是经常可以发现的。党的政治工作人员，缺乏经济工作的知识，缺乏马克思列宁主义的修养，但有些同志至今还没有重视这样的缺点，还没有认真地去学习，这就更表现了问题的严重性。总之，我们党的政治工作人员均要力戒自满，均要正视自己工作中的缺点，并研究如何去克服的办法。只有这样，才能有效地提高党的领导作用，进一步贯彻党的政治工作与经济工作相结合的工作方针。
    三、加强城市党委对国营企业
        党组织的具体领导
    一年来东北各城市、工矿区的党委业已根据党中央和东北局的指示，改进了党对当地国营企业的领导，像上述东北局指示中所批评的那种对国营企业生产好坏不负责任的情况基本上已不存在了。特别是经过伟大的“三反”“五反”运动后，党委对当地工、矿企业中的情况更加了解，领导也更为具体了。但由于国家经济建设的迅速发展，国营企业对地方党组织的要求也越来越繁重了。比如要迅速改变目前基本建设工作领导异常薄弱的严重情况，就要求我们城市、工矿区的党加以极大的注意，真正按照东北局所指示的，把搞好基本建设提到党的领导工作的首要地位，检查和督促实现东北人民政府工业部最近关于加强基本建设工作的指示，特别要迅速帮助建立这个部门中党的政治工作以及工会和青年团的工作，并适当帮助调整一批干部去建立这些工作。又如工矿企业干部目前都迫切要求组织学习来提高自己的政治理论水平，但因无得力的指导，不易坚持。东北人民政府工业部所属某些管理局的负责干部在参加了工业部每周一次的高级干部政治理论学习后，就组织其所属各工厂负责同志一样学习，经验证明这样做的效果甚好，我想这种办法在各城市党委的直接领导下也是可以仿行的。总之，国营企业中党的工作是多方面的，但一切工作的布置均应以生产为中心。党的领导必须力求具体，避免脱离中心的倾向，要多到现场去，了解企业部门的党委及基层组织的工作情况，帮助他们解决实际问题，尽量减少文件的往返，上面召开的会议，要有准备并尽可能地减少次数，缩短会议时间。在上述座谈会上有些同志批评个别地方党委不照顾工厂的生产环境，各部门都去要统计、要材料、召开会议，以至应付不过来，甚至妨碍工厂负责人对生产工作的指导，这种情况是应该引起特别注意和纠正的。
    在纪念我党伟大的三十一周年的时候，我们东北的国营企业在毛主席、党中央和中央人民政府的正确领导下，是获得了巨大成就的，这种成就现在已经成为带动我们整个国民经济前进的纽带和动力。让我们紧密地团结在毛主席、党中央的周围，彻底实现党中央和东北局的指示，加强学习，全面地贯彻依靠工人阶级管理工业办好工厂的基本思想，充分发挥工矿企业中党组织的作用，争取最好地完成和超过国家生产计划，提高产品质量，深入开展增产节约八百万吨粮食的爱国主义竞赛运动，来迎接即将到来的全国大规模的经济建设！
