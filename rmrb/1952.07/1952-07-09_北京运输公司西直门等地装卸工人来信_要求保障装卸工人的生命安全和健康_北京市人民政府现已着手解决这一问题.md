To the Editor: We are workers of the Beijing Transportation Company, working at the cargo yards of the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company. We are now writing with great indignation to expose the mistakes of the administrative cadres of these two companies. They only care about us working and do not care about our safety and health, resulting in serious illnesses and casualties. The Yongdingmenwai cargo yard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company has 472 loading and unloading workers, divided into day and night shifts. In such a large site, there has long been no place to rest that can protect us from wind and rain. After work, we lie down haphazardly on the wood piles, exposed to the wind and sun. The problem is even more serious on rainy days, and we have to lean back-to-back to let the rain pour; no one cares if we are shivering from the cold. The Xizhimen lumberyard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company also has more than 600 loading and unloading workers, and their site also lacks sufficient rest rooms. More than 100 night shift workers often sleep outdoors on wood piles, or huddle in makeshift shacks made of a few wooden sticks and broken mats. On the night of May 30, it rained heavily, and everyone couldn't bear it, and planned to take shelter temporarily in the office of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company; the staff of the company said without any class sympathy: "You are workers of the Transportation Company, we can't control you!" After saying that, they simply locked the door. The security personnel on the scene couldn't stand it and tried to persuade them, but it didn't work. As the saying goes, "You have to build a fence even for livestock." But we don't even have a place to shelter from the wind and rain. Now, many young and strong workers have become ill, and our health has been seriously damaged.

    The environment on the site is so bad, and we can't get enough rest when we return to the dormitory. Take the Yongdingmenwai cargo yard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company as an example. The workers' dormitory is Jiangsu Yiyuan, where coffins are parked. The houses here are dilapidated, some houses only have two sides left of the four walls, and the better ones have no windows or doors, the roofs have holes, and it leaks everywhere. When we first came here, there were still 34 coffins parked inside, with a pungent smell. We spread mats on this dirty and humid ground and slept with the dead. As a result, many people have suffered from dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. The dormitory problem of the workers at the Xizhimen lumberyard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company is even more serious. Most people live in broken mat shacks, and they have to lower their heads and bend over to enter and exit; nine people are crammed into a small bunker left by a Kuomintang bandit army.

    Insufficient lighting on the site and tools that are not only of poor quality but also insufficient in number have created even greater difficulties for us. In the lumberyards of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company, the lights are dim, making it very difficult to unload goods and stack them. The company has lanterns but does not lend them to our workers. The electric switches on the light poles are not equipped with fuse boxes, and we often touch the wires when stacking, which is very dangerous! The cement warehouse lacks ventilation equipment and the temperature is extremely high. The handles of carrying poles and levers are not made of good materials, so they often break. The accidents in which our hands and feet are injured cannot be counted. Jumping boards and large ropes are also extremely lacking. The Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company also emphasizes that there is not enough space, and requires us to stack wood piles as high as 9.8 meters, which is twice the general regulations. From the end of April to the beginning of June, six workers were injured by falling from stacking too high. Due to the lack of tools on the site, tragic incidents of workers being crushed to death have continued to occur: On May 15, the Xibianmen cargo yard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company transported 34 cars of timber from Northeast China. When unloading large square timber, a loading and unloading worker, Li Ergui, was crushed to death because the large rope was not long enough. Afterwards, the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company paid 2 million yuan for the funeral. On May 22, the Xizhimen lumberyard of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company transported three cars of logs from Northeast China. Because the turnout in the yard was too high and the pry bar was too short, a temporary loading and unloading worker, Zhao Zhongchang, was crushed to death. The Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company and the Transportation Company only blamed the crushed people for "poor skills" and said they were not responsible for the accident. On June 3, workers from the Transportation Company pulled eight-meter-long logs from the Xizhimen warehouse of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company to the Xinghua Lumber Mill for processing. In order to facilitate the inspection of goods, the inspectors of these two companies did not allow horse-drawn carts to enter and exit the warehouse collectively. Since there were not enough manpower for unloading and there were no tools such as carrying poles and pry bars, a cart worker, Zhang Yonghe, was crushed to death. The funeral arrangements have now been handled by the trade union, but the issue of responsibility has not been resolved.

    Editor! We urgently request to improve the safety equipment on the site and eliminate these bloody incidents. We request to solve the problem of dormitories and on-site rest rooms to protect our health. We have repeatedly raised opinions to the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company and the Transportation Company, but because they shirk responsibility to each other, the problem has not been resolved. We clearly understand: Now we are the masters of the country and should work hard to produce and overcome difficulties with the attitude of the masters of the country; but we cannot tolerate the illnesses and casualties caused by the bureaucracy of some cadres. We request the relevant departments to make a thorough handling of this matter quickly.
    Loading and unloading workers from Xibianmen, Xizhimen, and Yongdingmen of the Beijing Transportation Company

    Investigative Report by Our Reporter
    We, together with reporters from the Workers' Daily, conducted investigations at the cargo yards and workers' dormitories of the Beijing Branch of the Coal Construction Company and relevant departments, and proved that what the workers said in the letter was true. The results of the investigation are reported as follows:

    The task of loading and unloading goods at the cargo yards of the Beijing Branch of the Coal Construction Company has been contracted by the Beijing Transportation Company since April 1951, and a contract has been signed between the two parties. Because the workers' wages are based on piecework, and the workers have fixed employers and work sites, the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company mistakenly believes that "the workers are not their own," "I pay, you work," and "the safety and health of the workers should be the responsibility of the Transportation Company"; while the Transportation Company excuses that "since the workers are fixed in your factory, the safety and health should be your responsibility." Both parties have abandoned the education and management of the workers. Few people care about the workers' accommodation, rest, and problems such as injury, disability, illness, and death, and accidents of workers' injuries and illnesses continue to occur. In the last five months of the second half of last year alone, the Xibianmen warehouse had as many as 1,300 workers injured on the job. In the twenty days from May 15 to June 3 this year, three cargo yards of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company successively had the tragic incidents of three workers being crushed to death, seventeen seriously injured, and sixty-nine slightly injured. Because the workers' working conditions and accommodation conditions are very bad, the number of sick workers is increasing every day. According to statistics from the end of April to the beginning of June, 103 of the 472 workers living in the Jiangsu Yiyuan dormitory outside Yongdingmen were sick, and 20 to 30 people could not work every day due to illness. The number of injured workers who sought medical treatment in the surgery department of the workers' hospital averaged 27 per day in late April, and increased to 39 in late May. This situation urgently needs to be improved.

    The reasons for these accidents are certainly related to the sudden increase in timber transportation tasks in Beijing since May this year, the insufficient deployment of technical workers by the Transportation Company, and the poor skills of newly recruited workers; but the main reason is that the leading cadres of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company have capitalist business ideas (the so-called "I pay, you work"), and are indifferent to the suffering and life safety of the workers. They do not try to improve the on-site equipment, and they shirk responsibility after accidents occur. Although the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce had instructed as early as June last year that the lighting equipment and tools on the site should be the responsibility of the Beijing Coal Construction Branch Company, they did not implement this instruction well. This year, the loading and unloading tasks have been increased and the number of workers has surged, but the company's budget for purchasing tools has decreased by 30%, so the quality of the purchased tools does not meet the standards. The workers have repeatedly requested to solve the problem of on-site rest rooms, but they have repeatedly shirked and delayed. Meng Dagang, the head of the storage and transportation section of this company, even ridiculously believes that workers' injuries and deaths "are inevitable." The bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of the Transportation Company is also serious. In order to complete the task, they only care about recruiting a large number of temporary workers, but do not seriously educate the workers on safety technology. Although the company has a safety inspection committee, it has never held a serious meeting to study the work. When allocating workers to the Yongdingmen cargo yard, they deceived the workers and said that there "are dormitories and rest rooms" there; as a result, nothing was prepared. When the workers wanted to clean the Jiangsu Yiyuan dormitory, they asked several times before they were given half a bottle of carbolic acid. When the trade union mobilized workers to engage in voluntary labor to bury the coffins, the administrative side of the Transportation Company also emphasized that the business was busy and asked the trade union to pay people to bury them. In the end, the trade union took out 5 million yuan from the welfare fund to bury the coffins and repair the houses. No wonder the workers said, "The Transportation Company only draws our handling fees."

    In order to solve the above problems, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, convened a meeting of relevant departments a few days ago. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Zhang severely criticized this erroneous thinking of not caring about the workers' suffering, and clearly instructed: In the future, for cargo yards with fixed cargo owners, all lighting equipment, loading and unloading tools, and workers' rest room problems should be the responsibility of the cargo owner; for the above-mentioned injuries and deaths that have occurred, the Municipal Supervision Committee will investigate and deal with them, and those who are derelict in their duties will be punished.

    From the above situation, we believe that there are two issues that should be paid attention to: One is that the bourgeois thinking of "only valuing production and not valuing workers" still seriously exists in some cadres of our state-owned enterprises. Although the Party has repeatedly taught us to rely on the working class to run enterprises well, and although bourgeois thinking has been strictly criticized in the "Three-Anti" movement, they still treat the working class with the capitalist business view of "I pay, you work." This is an intolerable serious error. The relevant party committees should strengthen ideological leadership over these units and further eliminate the influence of bourgeois thinking in state-owned enterprises. Another issue is that the safety and health and labor protection and welfare issues of loading and unloading workers with greater mobility are very easily overlooked. Therefore, we suggest that trade union organizations at all levels and local labor departments thoroughly understand the lives and sufferings of loading and unloading workers, supervise state-owned and private enterprises to strictly implement relevant labor protection laws, and solve the problems that workers urgently need to solve, in order to protect the health and safety of loading and unloading workers.

    We hope that the competent departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Government will earnestly follow the instructions of Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, quickly improve the safety and health equipment of loading and unloading workers, quickly handle this serious problem, and publish the results in the newspaper.

    北京运输公司西直门等地装卸工人来信
    要求保障装卸工人的生命安全和健康
    北京市人民政府现已着手解决这一问题
    编辑同志：我们是北京市运输公司的工人，在中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司各货场工作。现在我们以十分愤慨的心情来揭发这两个公司的行政干部的错误。他们只管要我们干活，不关心我们的安全卫生，以致造成严重的疾病伤亡事故。北京煤建分公司永定门外货场有装卸工人四百七十二名，分日夜两班干活。在这么大的现场里，竟长期没有一个可以防风避雨的休息地方。我们干罢活便东倒西卧地在木垛上休息，任凭风吹日晒。下雨天问题就更严重了，大伙只好背靠背地让雨淋；我们冻得浑身发抖也没人管。北京煤建分公司西直门木材厂也有装卸工人六百余名，他们的现场也没有足够的休息室。夜班工人经常有一百多人露宿在木垛上，或者蜷伏在用几根木棍临时搭起来的破席窝里。五月三十日夜里，雨下得很大，大伙被淋得实在受不住了，打算就近到北京煤建分公司的办公室里暂时避一下雨；公司的工作人员竟然毫无阶级同情心地说：“你们是运输公司的工人，我们管不着！”说罢干脆把门锁上了。现场的警卫人员看不过去，劝解了一番，也没有效果。俗语说：“养头牲口也要给搭个栅。”可是我们却连个躲风避雨的地方都没有。现在，很多年青力壮的工人已经得了病，我们的健康已经受到了严重的损害。
    现场的环境是这样恶劣，回到宿舍也一样得不到充分休息。就拿北京煤建分公司永定门外货场来说，工人宿舍就是停放灵柩的江苏义园。这儿的屋子破烂不堪，有的屋子的四边墙只剩下了两边，比较像样一点的，也是没窗没门，屋顶有窟窿，四处漏雨。我们乍来时，这里面还停有棺材三十四具，臭味扑鼻。我们就在这肮脏潮湿的地面上，铺着席子，和死人睡在一块。因此，很多人都先后害了头晕、呕吐、拉肚子病。北京煤建分公司西直门木材厂工人的宿舍问题比这更严重，大部分人都是住在破席窝里，出入要低头弯腰；在一个国民党匪军遗留下来的小碉堡里，就挤了九个人。
    现场照明不足，工具不仅质量不好，而且不够使用，这给我们造成的困难就更大了。北京煤建分公司各木材货场，灯光昏暗，卸货码垛时非常困难，公司有提灯也不借给咱工人使用。电灯杆上的电闸不安装保险闸盒，我们码垛时经常要碰着电线，多么危险！洋灰库缺乏通风设备，温度极高。搬子把和抬杠等工具，都不是用好材料制造的，因而经常折断。我们的手脚被砸伤的事故就无法统计了。跳板大绳也极缺乏。北京煤建分公司还强调地方不够使，要求我们码木垛高达九米八，超过一般规定的一倍。自四月底到六月初，因码垛过高摔伤工人六名。由于现场工具不够使用，砸死工人的惨痛事件不断发生：五月十五日，北京煤建分公司西便门货场运到东北木材三十四车。卸大方木时，因大绳不够，砸死装卸工人李尔贵，事后由北京煤建分公司支付丧费二百万元了事。五月二十二日，北京煤建分公司西直门木材场运到东北原木三车，因场内道岔太高，扒杠太短，砸死临时装卸工赵忠昌。北京煤建分公司和运输公司只怪被砸死的人“技术不好”，表示不负事故责任。六月三日，运输公司工人由北京煤建分公司西直门仓库拉八米大的原木到兴华制材厂加工，这两个公司的验货员为了验货方便，不让马车集体出入仓库，卸车时人力既然不够，又无搬子、扒杠等工具，以致砸死了大车工人张永和。现在埋葬事宜已由工会办理，但责任问题尚未处理。
    编辑同志！我们迫切要求改善现场的安全设备，根绝这种血的事件，我们要求解决宿舍和现场休息室的问题，以保障我们身体的健康。我们曾经多次地向北京煤建分公司和运输公司提出意见，可是因为他们互相推诿责任，问题始终没有解决。我们清楚地懂得：现在我们是国家的主人，应该以国家主人的态度，努力生产，克服困难；但是由于某些干部的官僚主义而造成的疾病伤亡事故，我们是不能忍受的。我们要求有关部门对这件事迅速作一次彻底的处理。
    北京市运输公司西便门西直门永定门装卸工人
    本报记者的调查报告
    我们曾协同工人日报记者到煤建公司北京分公司各货场、工人宿舍和有关部门进行调查，证明工人来信所说的都是事实。兹将调查结果报告如下：
    煤建公司北京分公司所属各货场货物的装卸任务，自一九五一年四月起由北京运输公司统一承揽，双方订有合同。由于工人的工资采用了按件计工制，工人又有固定雇主和工作现场，所以北京煤建分公司就错误地认为“工人不是自己的”，“我掏钱，你干活”，“工人的安全卫生应由运输公司负责”；而运输公司则藉口“工人既然固定在你的厂里干活，安全卫生就要你负责”。双方都放弃了对工人的教育和管理。工人的住宿、休息以及伤、残、病、死等问题，很少有人关心，工人的伤亡疾病事故不断发生。仅西便门仓库在去年下半年的五个月中，工人因工负伤的即达一千三百余名。今年五月十五日至六月三日的二十天当中，北京煤建分公司所属三个货场又连续发生砸死工人三名、重伤十七名、轻伤六十九名的惨痛事件。因为工人的劳动条件和住宿条件十分恶劣，害病的工人日有增加。住在永定门外江苏义园宿舍的四百七十二名工人，据四月底至六月初的统计，害病的达一百零三人，每日因病不能干活的有二、三十人。在工人医院外科就诊的负伤工人，四月下旬每日平均二十七人，五月下旬已增加到三十九人。这种情况急待改善。
    发生这些事故的原因，固然和今年五月以来北京市木材运输任务突然增加，运输公司技术工人不敷调配，新招工人技术欠佳有一定的关系；但主要的是北京煤建分公司的领导干部存在着资本主义的经营思想（即所谓“我掏钱，你干活”），对工人的疾苦和生命安全漠不关心。现场设备不好，他们不去设法改善，而在发生事故以后，他们又推卸责任。虽然远在去年六月间，北京市工商局即曾指示现场的照明设备和工具应该由北京煤建分公司负责，但他们并没有很好地执行这一指示。今年装卸任务加重，工人人数激增，该公司购买工具的预算，反而减少百分之三十，因此购买的工具，质量不合规格。工人屡次要求解决现场休息室的问题，他们一再推诿拖延。这个公司的储运科科长孟大刚，甚至荒谬地认为工人的伤亡事故“是不可避免的”。运输公司领导干部的官僚主义作风也是严重的。他们为了完成任务，只顾大量招收临时工，而不去认真地对工人进行安全技术教育。公司虽然有安全检查委员会，却从未开过一次认真研究工作的会议。在调拨工人到永定门货场时，他们欺骗工人说，那里“有宿舍、有休息室”；结果什么也没有准备好。工人要把江苏义园宿舍清扫一下，要求了几次，他们才发给半瓶石炭酸。当工会发动工人从事义务劳动来埋葬灵柩时，运输公司的行政方面还强调业务忙，要工会出钱雇人埋。最后，还是由工会拿出五百万元福利金埋了灵柩，修理了房屋。难怪工人说，“运输公司只会抽咱们的手续费”了。
    为了解决以上问题，北京市人民政府副市长张友渔已于日前召集有关部门开会。会上张副市长严厉地批判了这种不关心工人疾苦的错误思想，并明确指示：今后凡有固定货主的货场，一切照明设备、装卸工具和工人休息室的问题，一律应由货主负责解决；对于上述已经发生的伤亡事故，决定由市监察委员会调查处理，予失职者以处分。
    从以上的情况看，我们认为有两个应该注意的问题：一个是，资产阶级的“只重视生产，不重视工人”的思想，在我们国营企业的某些干部中还严重地存在着。党虽然一再教导我们依靠工人阶级办好企业，虽然在“三反”运动中严格地批判了资产阶级思想，他们却依然以“我掏钱，你干活”的资产阶级经营观点来对待工人阶级。这是不能容忍的严重错误。有关党委应该加强对这些单位的思想领导，进一步肃清国营企业中的资产阶级思想影响。另一个问题是，流动性较大的装卸工人的安全卫生和劳保福利问题，十分容易被人忽视。因此，我们建议各级工会组织和各地劳动部门，深入了解装卸工人的生活和疾苦，监督公私营企业严格执行有关劳动保护的法令，解决工人所迫切需要解决的问题，以保障装卸工人的健康和安全。
    我们希望北京市人民政府主管部门切实按照张友渔副市长的指示，迅速改进装卸工人的安全卫生设备，迅速处理这个严重问题，并将结果在报上发表。
