    The Central South Military and Political Committee held its eighty-fourth administrative meeting on July 22. The meeting listened to and approved Tang Tianji, the general commander of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, on the summary report of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, and Liu Fei, the head of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project acceptance team, on the acceptance report of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project.

    At the meeting, Zhang Nanxian, the vice chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, spoke. He believed that the early and successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project was a miracle created by the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. At the meeting, he also paid tribute to the 300,000 military workers, civilian workers, and engineering command organs who participated in the project. Finally, Deng Zihui, the vice chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, spoke. He said that the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is a major event in the economic construction of the Central South region and even the whole country. It not only eliminates the threat of floods on both sides of the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze River and ensures the safe navigation of the Yangtze River, promotes the exchange of materials, but also buys time and creates conditions for the comprehensive management of the Yangtze River in the future. Politically, it once again demonstrated the superiority of the new democratic social system of the new China, proved the great power of the creative labor of the Chinese people, and further encouraged the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life across the country to actively participate in the construction of the motherland and enhanced their confidence in the construction of the motherland. The vast number of employees who personally participated in this project have improved their technical level and organizational leadership ability in the actual construction process and accumulated and created rich experience. At the meeting, Deng Zihui called on everyone: The Jingjiang water disaster has been basically resolved, but the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project still has many unfinished projects to be continued after the autumn. The fundamental project for managing the Yangtze River awaits comprehensive construction in the future. We must carefully summarize the experience in all aspects of this project construction, especially the technical achievements and experience, to welcome the larger-scale water conservancy construction in the future.
