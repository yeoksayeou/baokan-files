    Fishing Nets Frequently Damaged in Baishuituo and Other Villages in Tanggu District
    To the Editor: Fishermen in the fishing villages of Baishuituo and Lujiuhe in Tanggu District, Tianjin, rely solely on two or three small sampans (referred to as "pai zi" by the fishermen) to set bottom nets or cast nets for fishing in the sea. Fishing boats from other fishing villages, relying on their larger size and higher speed, do not navigate in empty channels without fishing nets. Instead, they arbitrarily damage the fishing nets of Baishuituo and Lujiuhe villages. When the fishermen guarding the nets greet them, point out the routes, or even make requests, they ignore them and continue to ram into the nets marked with poles. From March of this year alone, 639 nets in the two villages have been damaged. Each net is valued at 100,000 yuan, totaling over 63.9 million yuan. Furthermore, when the fishing nets are torn, all the fish in the nets also escape. According to the village head of Baishuituo, each bottom net can catch from ten catties to about one thousand catties of fish. If each net is estimated to catch 100 catties of fish, then 639 nets would result in a loss of 63,900 catties of fish; at 2,000 yuan per catty, this totals over 127.8 million yuan. Adding up the losses of nets and fish, the total amounts to 191,700 catties of millet. This does not even include the costs of repairing the nets, labor costs, and material costs. However, this situation of damaging fishing nets is still developing. If it is not stopped in time, it will cause even greater losses in the future.
    We suggest: 1. Strengthening the political education of fishermen: Relevant county and district cadres should frequently visit various fishing villages, especially remote ones, to educate fishermen to cherish the fishing tools of others, and instruct fishing boats in various places to display registered flags or boat numbers to strengthen organization and mutual supervision. 2. The public security police stations or garrison departments stationed in the fishing villages should provide more assistance to the fishermen in resolving these issues.

### 塘沽区白水坨等村渔网常遭破坏

    塘沽区白水坨等村渔网常遭破坏
    编辑同志：天津市塘沽区白水坨、驴驹河两渔村的渔民，仅依靠两三支小舢板（渔民称它为排子）在海里下地网或撩网捕鱼。其他渔村的渔船，仗着船大速度高，不在没有渔网的空道上航行，而任意破坏白水坨、驴驹河两村的渔网。守网的渔民向他们打招呼、指给他们道路，甚至向他们提出要求，他们也不理睬，仍然冲着立有杆子的网上撞去。两村仅自本年三月份以来，就被撞坏渔网六百三十九条。每条网按十万元计算，约合六千三百多万元。还有，渔网被拉坏以后，网里的鱼也全跑掉了。据白水坨村长说：每张地网可捕鱼十多斤到一千斤左右。如果每张网按捕鱼一百斤计算，六百三十九条网，就损失鱼六万三千九百斤；每斤按二千元计算，共合一亿二千七百多万元。把网和鱼的损失加起来，共计折合十九万一千七百斤小米，这还没有把修网费、工费、料费等计算在内。但是，这种破坏渔网的情况，目前还在发展；如果不及时制止，今后会造成更大的损失。
    我们建议：一、加强渔民的政治教育：有关县区干部应常到各渔村，尤其是僻远的渔村，教育渔民们爱惜别人的捕鱼工具，并指示各地渔船挂号旗或船号，以加强组织，并互相检查。二、驻渔村的公安派出所或警备部门，应多协助渔民解决这类问题。
