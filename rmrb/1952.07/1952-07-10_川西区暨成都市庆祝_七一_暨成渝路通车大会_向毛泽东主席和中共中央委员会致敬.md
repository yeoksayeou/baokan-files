    Celebration of the "July 1st" Anniversary and the Completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by the People of the Western Sichuan Administrative Region and Chengdu City: A Salute to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    [Our Dispatch] The celebration of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and the completion of the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by the people of the Western Sichuan Administrative Region and Chengdu City sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, paying tribute to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The original telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao: On the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, we extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to you and all comrades of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by you!

    Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China headed by you, our people's revolutionary and construction undertakings have achieved continuous victories, enabling us to obtain a beautiful and happy life. What makes us especially grateful is that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan have longed for for more than 40 years, has been fully opened to traffic in just two years under the leadership of the Party! When we see the brand-new train speeding on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, we immediately think of a better tomorrow, and immediately think of your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by you, which is the guarantee of the happiness of our people's lives. Today, when 300,000 people in our Western Sichuan Administrative Region and Chengdu City gather to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Party and the full opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, we must continue to work hard to build the Tianfu-Chengdu Railway to respond to your great call to us!

    The Celebration of the 31st Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China and the Completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by the People of the Western Sichuan Administrative Region and Chengdu City
