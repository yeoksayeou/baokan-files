To our beloved Chairman Mao:

We, the entire staff of Tangshan Steel Plant, report to you a great piece of good news: We have successfully tested the surface blown alkaline converter steelmaking method and will soon begin formal mass production. We offer this new steelmaking method, which is of great significance to China's steel industry, as a gift to you and the Party.

The characteristic of this new steelmaking method is to use China's ordinary pig iron as raw material, implement blowing in an alkaline converter, and directly manufacture low-carbon steel with quality similar to that of open-hearth steel. This will increase our plant's production efficiency by more than two times; at the same time, it will reduce costs, saving the country 50 billion yuan in wealth annually. This is a great victory for us on the production front.

We are able to create this new steelmaking method thanks to your wise leadership. From the beginning of the experiment to its success, we went through eleven months and encountered many difficulties. But because we are led and encouraged by you and the Party, our workers and technicians cooperated closely, gave play to the collective creative wisdom, painstakingly researched, constantly explored and advanced, overcame difficulties, and finally succeeded in the experiment. Our mastery of this new steelmaking method will accumulate huge wealth for the country and open up a new steelmaking path for China's steel industry.

We will never be arrogant because of this, and will continue to work hard to increase production and improve management. We are determined to create more and greater achievements in the patriotic production increase and economy practice campaign.

The Entire Staff of Tangshan Steel Plant

    试验表面吹炼硷性转炉炼钢法成功
    敬爱的毛主席：我们唐山钢铁厂全体职工向您报告一件大喜事：我们试验表面吹炼硷性转炉炼钢法已告成功，即将正式大量生产。我们把这个在我国钢铁工业上有重大意义的新炼钢法，作为对您和党的献礼。
    这个新炼钢法的特点是用我国一般生铁作原料，在硷性转炉中实行吹炼，直接制造与平炉钢品质相仿佛的低炭钢。这将使我厂生产效率提高二倍以上；同时使成本降低，一年中为国家节约财富五百亿元。这是我们在生产战线上的一个大胜利仗。
    我们能够创造这个新的炼钢法，应该感谢您的英明领导。我们从开始试验到试验成功，前后经过十一个月，曾遇到不少困难。但因为有您和党领导着和鼓舞着我们，我们工人和技术人员亲密合作，发挥了集体的创造性的智慧，苦心钻研，不断地摸索前进，克服困难，最后终于试验成功了。我们掌握了这个新的炼钢法，将给国家积累巨大财富，并给我国钢铁工业开辟一条新的炼钢道路。
    我们决不因此而骄傲，还要再接再厉，努力提高生产，改善经营。我们决心在爱国增产节约竞赛运动中，创造出更多更大的成绩。
    唐山钢铁厂全体职工
