    Tangshan Municipal Public Stone Company Decides to Improve Work by Combining with Democratic Reform
    Editor Comrades: The criticisms of our company by Comrades Feng Jiuling and Feng Jiulu, published on the "Reader's Letters" page on June 25th, are correct. We are now informing you of our self-criticism and response.

    Our company was established not long ago and has a weak foundation. Therefore, some worker welfare issues have not been resolved immediately. Due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres, many unreasonable phenomena have occurred, for which we should take full responsibility.

    It is true that our company's clinic has poor equipment, a small number of medical personnel, and a poor work style. We have appropriately improved the clinic's equipment, hired two additional doctors, and strengthened leadership over the work of the clinic. The issue of tea kettles being burned by lightly injured workers has been corrected by us.

    Regarding the issue of deducting tool fees from workers' wages, its historical reason is: In the past, our company did not have long-term workers, and we only had a purchasing and sales relationship with the workers. At the end of last year, based on the company's development needs, most of the workers were converted into long-term workers. At that time, due to the limitations of cadres and equipment, it was agreed upon by the workers' representative meeting to add a tool fee to the workers' wages, allowing workers to provide their own tools. Later, some quarrying tools were purchased uniformly by the company. Although this is not a deduction of wages, the relationship with the workers is abnormal. We are planning to correct it.

    The situation of receiving more stones but paying less money when collecting stones is an individual case. The reason is that some collection personnel lack experience. We have decided to strengthen their professional education. Last year, when our company converted workers into long-term workers, a portion of workers were classified as external workers for various reasons, and we have also made appropriate arrangements. This practice is not intended to prevent workers from enjoying labor insurance benefits. However, due to insufficient investigation and research, there are shortcomings in our work. We will pay better attention to this issue in our future work.

    Regarding the issue of stockpiled rock waste, it has not only affected workers' production but also tied up funds. This shows that we lack planning in production and do not pay enough attention to workers' opinions, which should be corrected.

    The above situation shows that our leading cadres' understanding of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well is not clear. We have decided to fully listen to the opinions of the workers and masses and improve our work in the current democratic reform movement.

### 唐山市公营石头公司决定结合民主改革改进工作

    唐山市公营石头公司决定结合民主改革改进工作
    编辑同志：六月二十五日“读者来信专页”刊登的冯九龄、冯九禄两同志对我公司的批评是正确的。现将我们的检讨和答复告诉你们。
    我公司建立不久，基础较差，因此，某些工人福利问题没有立刻解决。由于领导干部有官僚主义作风，以致发生了很多不合理的现象，这是我们应该完全负责的。
    我公司医疗所设备不好，医务人员数量少，作风又不好，确是事实。我们已适当改善医疗所的设备，增聘医生二人，加强对医疗所工作的领导。受轻伤工人烧茶锅的问题，我们已经纠正了。
    关于从工人工资中扣除工具费的问题，它的历史原因是：过去我公司没有里工，和工人只有购销关系；去年年底根据公司发展的需要，把大部工人收为里工。当时由于干部及设备条件的限制，经工人代表会研究同意，在工人工资内加发工具费，让工人自备工具。后来有些采石用具由公司统一购置。这虽不是克扣工资，但和工人关系是不正常的。我们正计划加以纠正。
    收量石头时多收石头少给钱的情况是个别的。原因是有些收量人员缺乏经验。我们决定对他们加强业务教育。去年我公司把工人改为里工时，有一部分工人因某些原因被划为外工，我们也已作了适当安置。这种作法，并不是为了不让工人享受劳保待遇。但因为调查研究不够，工作中缺点是有的。我们将在今后工作中更好地注意这个问题。
    关于积压毛碴问题，既影响了工人生产，又积压了资金。这说明我们生产上缺乏计划，且对工人意见重视不够，当加以改正。
    以上情况说明我们领导干部依靠工人阶级搞好企业的思想是不明确的。我们决定在最近进行的民主改革运动中，充分听取工人群众的意见，改进我们的工作。
