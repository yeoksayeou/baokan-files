Since Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a "combined contract" with the Xue Yunhu mutual aid team, up to now, 58 supply and marketing cooperatives in 15 counties of Jilin Province have signed "combined contracts" with 25 agricultural production cooperatives and 61 mutual aid teams.

The process of supply and marketing cooperatives signing contracts with these agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is as follows: After learning from the experience of Erdaogou, they first publicized the advantages and methods of signing "combined contracts" to the mutual aid teams, and then, on a voluntary basis, sent cooperative cadres to participate in the discussions of the mutual aid teams, carefully helping them to formulate production plans and consumption plans, and negotiating conditions with each other before signing the contract. Generally, the process has been relatively smooth.

The "combined contracts" signed by these agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams with the supply and marketing cooperatives generally include the following contents: 1. The supply and marketing cooperatives give priority to production cooperatives or mutual aid teams in terms of supply and marketing, credit, and welfare facilities. They must guarantee the supply of essential materials and provide guaranteed sales or agency sales for commodity grain and major local and sideline products. 2. When production cooperatives or mutual aid teams purchase or sell goods, they must do so through the supply and marketing cooperative under fair and reasonable prices. They should also submit their purchase and sales plans for the following month to the supply and marketing cooperative in mid-month and sign specific contracts. 3. When the supply and marketing cooperative needs manpower or transportation, it should first use the labor and vehicles of the production cooperative or mutual aid team; the mutual aid team should actively assist the transportation work of the supply and marketing cooperative without affecting production. 4. When production cooperatives or mutual aid teams have surplus funds, they should, on a voluntary basis, invest in the supply and marketing cooperative or deposit them in the credit department as much as possible. 5. Both parties should maintain frequent contact. The production cooperative or mutual aid team should regularly make suggestions to the supply and marketing cooperative and reflect the demands of the members; the supply and marketing cooperative should help formulate production and consumption plans and help establish accounts, etc. 6. Both parties should cherish public property, etc.

According to the key trials in various places, it has been proven that the "combined contract" plays a significant role in strengthening the business planning of the supply and marketing cooperatives and promoting the planned production and consumption of the mutual aid teams. In the process of implementing the "combined contract," both the supply and marketing cooperative and the mutual aid team have been further developed and strengthened. After the Li Zhihua Production Cooperative (21 households) in Xiaoying Village, Yanji, signed a "combined contract" this year, it plans to harvest an average of 1,000 catties more rice per hectare than last year, increasing income by 34 million yuan. Sideline income will also increase by 2.9 million yuan compared to last year, and the purchasing power per person will increase by 65% compared to last year. At the same time, the planned consumption and means of production of the cooperative this year have increased in variety and quantity. 社员陈元默 said: "In the past, we didn't specifically think about how to grow more grain, but spent a lot of energy thinking about how to sell it for more money. After signing the contract this time, we all rely on the supply and marketing cooperative, overcome speculative thinking, and will do our best to improve production."

The experience of key trials in various places is: before signing a "combined contract," the mutual aid team should be fully educated so that the members of the mutual aid team correctly recognize the benefits of signing a contract and sign the "combined contract" on a conscious and voluntary basis. Secondly, helping the mutual aid team to formulate good production plans and consumption plans is an important key to whether the contract can be properly fulfilled. The process of formulating the plan is also the process of educating the peasants. The leadership and support of the rural Party organizations and the government should be obtained, propaganda and education work should be done well, production policies should be implemented, and the mutual aid teams should be introduced to market conditions, specifications and quality of purchased and sold materials, and help them calculate accounts, etc. Again, the higher-level cooperative should provide certain economic support to the grassroots cooperative that signs the "combined contract" to help it solve specific difficulties. This is very necessary to promote the smooth realization of the contract.

The main deviations that have been discovered so far are due to insufficient publicity of the significance of the "combined contract," and some mutual aid teams and cooperatives have wrong understandings and requirements for signing "combined contracts," such as: some mutual aid teams require the cooperative to provide more loans, and push all difficulties to the cooperative to solve; some cooperatives stimulate mutual aid teams to sign contracts simply by means of credit, and focus more on supporting sideline businesses; and some cooperatives disregard subjective forces and local objective conditions and sign one or twenty contracts in one breath. All of these should be corrected.

Based on the above situation and existing problems, the Jilin Provincial Cooperative Headquarters has instructed its affiliated county cooperatives to conduct a general inspection of the spring plowing supply of cooperatives in the "combined contract" trial areas, summarize experiences, correct shortcomings, and improve understanding. Counties that have not yet conducted trials must immediately organize forces, study documents well, select appropriate targets, and conduct key trials.

### 吉林省十五个县试行推广“结合合同”

    吉林省十五个县试行推广“结合合同”
    自二道沟供销合作社与薛云虎互助组订立“结合合同”以后，到目前为止，吉林省已有十五个县的五十八个供销合作社与二十五个农业生产合作社、六十一个互助组订立了“结合合同”。
    供销社和这些农业生产合作社、互助组签订合同的过程是：学习了二道沟的经验后，先向互助组宣传订“结合合同”的好处与作法，然后在自愿的基础上，派合作社干部参加互助组讨论，细心地帮助订立生产计划与消费计划，互相商定条件，然后订立。一般进行得都比较顺利。
    综合这些农业生产合作社、互助组与供销合作社所签订的“结合合同”，大致包括了以下几个内容：一、供销社在供销上以及信贷、福利设施等方面给生产社或互助组以优先权。对需要的主要物资，必须保证供应，对商品粮及主要土、副产品给包销或代销。二、生产社或互助组购、销货物时，在价格公平合理的情况下，必须通过供销合作社。并在每月中旬向供销社提出下月的购、销计划，签订具体合同。三、供销社需用人工或运输工具时，首先使用生产社或互助组的劳力及车马；互助组在不影响生产的情况下，应当积极帮助供销社的运输工作。四、生产社或互助组有剩余资金时，按自愿原则尽量向供销社入股或存于信用部。五、双方经常联系，生产社或互助组对供销社经常提出建议，反映组员的要求；供销社帮助订生产和消费计划，帮助建立账目等。六、双方爱护公共财产等。
    根据各地重点试办的情况，证明了“结合合同”在加强供销社的业务计划性和促进互助组有计划的生产和消费方面都起着很大作用。在执行“结合合同”过程中，供销社与互助组都进一步得到了发展与壮大。延吉小营村李致华生产合作社（二十一户）今年签订“结合合同”后，计划每垧地比去年平均多打一千斤稻子，增加收入三千四百万元，副业收入也要比去年增加二百九十万元，每人的购买力要较去年提高百分之六十五。同时该社今年计划的消费和生产资料在种类、数量上均有增加。社员陈元默说：“过去我们不是专门想如何多打粮食，而是花很大精力想如何多卖钱。这次订合同以后，都依靠了供销社，克服了投机思想，要全力搞好生产。”
    各地重点试办中的经验是：在签订“结合合同”以前要对互助组进行充分教育，使互助组员正确认识到订立合同的好处，在自觉自愿的基础上订立
    “结合合同”。其次，帮助互助组订好生产计划和消费计划，是能否正确履行合同的重要关键。订计划的过程也即是教育农民的过程，应取得农村党的组织和政府的领导、支持，作好宣传教育工作，贯彻生产政策，并多向互助组介绍市场情况，购、销物资的规格、质量，帮助算账等。再次，上级社应给签订“结合合同”的基层合作社以一定的经济支援，帮助其解决具体困难。这对促进合同的顺利实现是非常必要的。
    目前已发现的主要偏向是由于对“结合合同”的意义宣传不够，部分互助组、合作社对订立“结合合同”有错误认识与要求，如：有的互助组要求合作社多贷款，什么困难也都推到合作社来解决；也有的合作社单纯以赊贷的条件刺激互助组订立合同，并多偏重于扶助副业；还有的合作社不顾主观力量和当地的客观条件，一气订了一、二十个合同。这些都应该加以纠正。
    吉林省合作总社根据以上情况和存在的问题，已指示所属各县合作社，要求普遍对试办“结合合同”地区的合作社，检查其春耕供应情况，并总结经验，纠正缺点，提高认识。尚未试办的县份，须立即组织力量，学好文件，选好对象，重点试办。
