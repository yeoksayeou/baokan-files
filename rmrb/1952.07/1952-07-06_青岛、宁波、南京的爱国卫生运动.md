    Patriotic Health Campaigns in Qingdao, Ningbo, and Nanjing
    Since the beginning of spring this year, the cities of Qingdao, Ningbo, and Nanjing have launched patriotic health campaigns, significantly improving environmental and personal hygiene.
    In Qingdao, the people launched a large-scale patriotic health campaign during the fight against germ warfare, achieving significant victories. According to incomplete statistics for May, approximately 200,000 rats and over 353,178,800 flies, mosquitoes, and other insects were caught in the city. Furthermore, over 24,800 tons of garbage were cleared, over 17,000 meters of sewage ditches were repaired, yellow sand was used to pave 80 *li* of road, over 1,300 toilets were repaired, and a large number of wells were improved. During a city-wide sanitation inspection held on June 22, the environmental hygiene of most households was found to be relatively good, and some residential groups had achieved "cleanliness in every home, hygiene for everyone." For example, residents of Anhui Road go out every morning to sweep the streets. Yuanjili in Ningbo Road was originally a dirty courtyard full of garbage and manure, but now it has a new look. All 129 households in the courtyard have whitewashed their houses, and the corridors and courtyards have been tidied up and cleaned. Residents in the southern district of the city have established a district-based "contracting" system for sweeping roads. In the rural suburbs, a cleanliness competition has also been launched between groups and households. Every morning, every household cleans inside and out, and the village's drainage ditches have been cleared, and manure piles are sealed with mud. Parents are also particularly concerned about children's hygiene. The villagers of Dongwu Village have also widely put forward the slogan "Sweep diligently, wash diligently, tidy up diligently."
    Ningbo's patriotic health campaign began in mid-April, and currently 81 percent of the city's population has participated in the clean-up campaign. Thousands of people, armed with iron rakes and shovels, filled sewage ditches and cleared garbage. During the campaign, they created more than ten types of rat traps. According to statistics on June 5, the city cleared a total of 30,563 tons of garbage, dredged 1,707 ditches (approximately 20,805 *zhang* long), filled 115 sewage rivers and depressions, filled more than 5,082 unhygienic private toilets and cesspools, and improved and dredged 492 wells. In addition, 80,700 rats were caught, and more than 9,875,000 flies and 5,159 square *chi* of maggots were eliminated, giving the city a brand-new look in every household and street.
    Nanjing adopted the method of "simultaneous propaganda and action" to mobilize the masses to participate in the patriotic health campaign, achieving great results. According to statistics on June 13, a total of 23,197 tons of garbage were cleared, 291 sewage ditches were filled, 66,432 *zhang* of sewage ditches were dredged, and more than 1,500 cesspools were filled. In addition, more than 137,600 rats were caught and 24,590 rat holes were filled; 272 *jin* of mosquitoes were caught and 1,041 *jin* of mosquito larvae were fished out. The comrades working in various agencies in Nanjing were unspeakably happy to see the results of their labor and proposed that they must work hard to eliminate mosquitoes and flies in the future, and make the health work more thorough, deeper, and more regular.

    青岛、宁波、南京的爱国卫生运动
    青岛、宁波、南京三市，自今年入春以来，都展开了爱国卫生运动，使环境卫生和个人卫生状况得到了很大的改进。
    青岛市人民在反细菌战的斗争中，展开了大规模的爱国卫生运动，并获得了重大胜利。据五月份不完全的统计：该市共捕鼠约二十万只，蝇蚊及其它昆虫约三亿五千三百一十七万八千余只。此外，又清除垃圾二万四千八百多吨，修整污水沟一万七千多公尺，用黄沙铺垫路面共达八十华里，修整厕所一千三百多个，并改善了大批的水井。在六月二十二日举行的全市清洁卫生大检查中，绝大部分户数的环境卫生都做得比较好，某些居民组已经做到“家家清洁，人人卫生”。如安徽路的居民每天早晨就出门清扫街道。宁波路元吉里原来是一个垃圾、粪便满地的脏院子，现在也面貌一新了，全院一百二十九户人家，全都用白粉刷了房子，走廊和院子也收拾得整齐清洁了。市南区的居民建立了分区“包干”清扫马路的制度。在市郊农村里，组与组、户与户之间也展开了清洁竞赛运动，每天清早，家家户户、里里外外都打扫得干干净净的，村里的水沟也被清理出来了，粪堆也用泥封起来。家长们也特别关心儿童的卫生。东吴家村的村民更普遍提出了“勤扫、勤洗、勤收拾”的口号。
    宁波市爱国卫生运动是在四月中旬开始的，目前全市百分之八十一的人口已参加了清洁大扫除工作。成千成百的群众带着铁耙、铁铲，填污水沟，清除垃圾。在运动中他们创造了捕鼠器十余种。根据六月五日的统计，全市共清除了垃圾三万零五百六十三吨，疏通沟渠一千七百零七条（长约二万零八百零五丈），填塞污水河和洼地一百十五处，填平不合卫生的私厕所、粪坑五千零八十二个，改善水井和淘井四百九十二个。此外，又捕鼠八万零七百只，消灭苍蝇九百八十七万五千多只、蛆五千一百五十九平方尺。使全市家家户户和大街小巷都焕然一新。
    南京市采取“一面宣传、一面行动”的办法，发动广大群众参加爱国卫生运动，获得很大的成绩。据六月十三日的统计，共清除垃圾二万三千一百九十七吨，填平污水沟二百九十一条，疏通污水沟六万六千四百三十二丈，填平粪坑一千五百余个。此外，捕鼠十三万七千六百多头，填塞鼠洞二万四千五百九十个；捕蚊二百七十二斤，打捞孑孓一千零四十一斤。南京市各机关的工作同志，见了自己的劳动成绩，心里有说不出的喜悦，并提出今后一定努力消灭蚊、蝇，把卫生工作做得更彻底，更深入，更经常。
