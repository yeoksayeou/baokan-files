    Jinan Railway Factory's Self-Criticism Regarding Backlogged Rationalization Proposals
    Editor: The criticism made by labor model Zhang Huaiyu in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 18th regarding the backlog of rationalization proposals in our factory is very correct. Recently, we sent people to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work related to rationalization proposals and discovered that since the establishment of the Rationalization Proposal Committee in July of last year, a total of 23 rationalization proposals have been backlogged. The reason for this is the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres. After the establishment of the Rationalization Proposal Committee, the working guidelines were unclear, which made it difficult for comrades responsible for specific tasks to handle the rationalization proposals. Our leading cadres also failed to inspect and supervise, which led the comrades responsible for specific tasks to adopt a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude towards the rationalization proposals, using the excuse of reviewing the rationalization proposals to hold them up for nineteen months without taking any action. This has seriously hindered the enthusiasm of the masses. Now we have decided to: re-establish the Promotion Committee, strengthen the leadership of the work on rationalization proposals, and prepare to conduct widespread education among technical personnel to correct the erroneous idea of not paying attention to rationalization proposals.

    济南铁路工厂对积压合理化建议的检讨
    编辑同志：六月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏中劳动模范张怀玉对我厂积压合理化建议提出的批评，是很正确的。最近我们派人普遍地检查了合理化建议的工作，发现去年七月成立合理化建议委员会以来，已共积压了二十三件合理化建议。原因是领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风；在合理化建议委员会成立以后，工作方针不明确，使得负责具体工作的同志处理合理化建议时产生了困难。我们领导干部又没有检查和督促，以致负责具体工作的同志对于合理化建议，采取了草率的不负责的态度，藉口审核合理化建议，把合理化建议压了十九个月，未作处理。这样就严重地阻碍了群众的积极性。现在我们已经决定：从新成立推行委员会，加强领导合理化建议的工作，并准备普遍地向技术人员进行教育，纠正不重视合理化建议的错误思想。
