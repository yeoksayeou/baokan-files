    Simplifying Procedures for Grain Transactions Between Huangpi County and Zhumadian

    Editor: I work at the Huangpi Branch of the China National Cereals Corporation. I would like to discuss the bureaucratic formalism I encounter in my work.

    If an organization, state-owned enterprise, or cooperative in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, wants to buy soybeans in Zhumadian City, Henan Province, the unit must send a cadre specifically with an official letter to the Huangpi County People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee to request a letter of introduction. The County People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee goes through the procedures of drafting, reviewing, signing, transcribing, proofreading, stamping, and registering before the letter of introduction is completed. The cadre who wants to buy soybeans then takes this letter of introduction to the Xiaogan Prefecture Finance and Economics Committee and exchanges it for another letter of introduction through the same procedures. Then, taking this letter of introduction to the Hubei Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, they go through the same procedures again to exchange it for another letter of introduction. Following this, they go through the same procedures at the Henan Provincial People's Government, Xinyang Prefecture, and Zhumadian City People's Government's Finance and Economics Committees, respectively, exchanging it for three more letters of introduction. Finally, they go to the Zhumadian City Administration for Industry and Commerce to obtain a purchase permit before they can buy the soybeans and bring them back. Similarly, if an organization in a county in Henan Province wants to buy rice in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, they must go through the same procedures as we do when buying soybeans. The various organizations involved do not conduct any review based on market conditions; they simply complete the "formalities" and write a "letter of introduction." If we were to calculate the losses in manpower, material resources, financial resources, and time caused by such bureaucratic formalism, it would be an astonishing sum!

    The above situation has improved somewhat since January of this year. For example, if an organization in Huangpi County wants to buy soybeans in Zhumadian City, it only needs to go through the Huangpi County People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee and the Zhumadian City People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee, and then apply to the Zhumadian City Administration for Industry and Commerce for approval. However, the procedures are still not simple enough. I believe that whether an organization from Huangpi County goes to Zhumadian to buy soybeans or an organization from another place comes to Huangpi County to buy rice, the purchaser should only need to obtain approval from the production area's Administration for Industry and Commerce, without having to go through so many procedures. I offer this opinion for the reference of relevant leaders.

### 简化黄陂县和驻马店两地之间买卖粮食的手续

    简化黄陂县和驻马店两地之间买卖粮食的手续
    编辑同志：我在中国粮食公司黄陂支公司工作。我想和你们谈谈我在业务上遇到的文牍主义的情形。
    在湖北省黄陂县的机关、公营企业或合作社，如果要到河南省驻马店市买豆子，这个单位便须专门派一个干部备了公文到黄陂县人民政府财政经济委员会去要介绍信。县人民政府财政经济委员会经过起稿、核稿、签发、誊写、校对、盖章、登记等手续后才把介绍信办好。要买豆子的干部拿着这介绍信再到孝感专署财政经济委员会，经过同样的手续换一封介绍信。又拿着这介绍信到湖北省人民政府财政经济委员会，又经过同样的手续再换一封介绍信。继又经同样手续到河南省人民政府、信阳专署、驻马店市人民政府的财政经济委员会分别换三次介绍信。最后又到驻马店市的工商行政机关领取准购证，这才能把豆子买回来。又如河南省某一县某一机关要到湖北省黄陂县买米，也要像我们买豆子一样要经过这些手续。依次经过的这些机关，他们并没有根据市场情况加以审核，只是形式地办过“手续”，写了一封“介绍信”。这样的文牍主义使人力、物力、财力、时间等所受的损失，如果算一算该是一笔多么惊人的账！
    上述情形，今年一月份以来有了些改进。如黄陂县的机关要到驻马店市买豆子，只须经过黄陂县人民政府财政经济委员会、驻马店市人民政府财政经济委员会，再转驻马店市工商行政部门请准即可。但是手续仍不够简单。我认为，不管黄陂县的机关到驻马店去买豆子或是其他地方的机关来黄陂县买米，购买人只须经过产地工商行政部门审核准购便行了，而不必费那么多的手续。这个意见特提供有关领导方面参考。
