    A Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Launches a Quick Literacy Campaign
    Comrade Editor: A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is using the lulls in combat to carry out a quick literacy campaign. The soldiers' high level of enthusiasm for learning has overcome all kinds of difficulties. The teaching materials and textbooks are all self-compiled by the unit. When there are no blackboards, they use iron plates to replace them; when there is no paper, they use sand tables to replace them. A heated learning competition has been launched between individuals and individuals, and between classes and classes. The cultural instructors are working hard to help the soldiers learn, some even teaching while sick. The soldiers never forget to study whether they are at work or resting, and some even recite phonetic symbols in their dreams. This learning campaign has boosted the soldiers' fighting spirit. They all say, "Only by improving our cultural level can we master modern weapons!"

    志愿军某部
    开展速成识字学习运动
    编辑同志：志愿军某部利用战斗的空隙，开展了速成识字学习运动。战士们高度的学习热情，战胜了各种各样的困难。教材、课本都是该部自编的。没有黑板，他们就用铁板来代替；没有纸张，他们就用沙盘来代替。个人和个人之间，班和班之间，都掀起了热火朝天的学习竞赛。文化教员们努力帮助战士学习，有的甚至抱病上课。战士们无论在工作中、休息时，都忘不了学习，有人在梦中念注音符号。这次学习运动鼓舞了战士们的战斗情绪。他们都说：“只有提高了文化，才能掌握现代化的武器！”  志愿军某部  毕唤起
