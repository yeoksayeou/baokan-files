Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th (TASS): At the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), Chairman Wilhelm Pieck delivered a speech on the 10th, condemning the "General Treaty" and the European Army Treaty signed by West German "Chancellor" Adenauer and Western countries, and explaining the new tasks of the German people in fighting for peace and defending the German Democratic Republic.

Pieck began by saying: It has been more than seven years since Hitlerite fascism was defeated, but Germany remains divided and without a peace treaty. This situation is completely intolerable. The German people have the right to demand the restoration of normal living conditions and the restoration of Germany as a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent nation. The German people have the right to conclude a peace treaty that would ensure that all occupation forces withdraw from Germany after the treaty is concluded, and that the German People's Police be responsible for defending the borders of Democratic Germany.

Pieck continued: The German people are willing to establish normal relations and peaceful cooperation with all countries. Therefore, they oppose dragging Germany into aggressive blocs. The German people believe that Germany must enjoy equal rights with other countries and must have the right to participate in the peaceful settlement of all issues related to European and world politics. The German people believe that there should be absolutely no restrictions on the peaceful economic development of Germany. These are the basic national demands of the German people.

Pieck pointed out: The Soviet draft principles for a German peace treaty aim to realize all the national demands of the German people. However, the traitors in Bonn and their American and West German big business masters refuse to meet the national demands of the German people. Instead, they signed the war-like "General Treaty" and the European Army Treaty.

Pieck announced: The German people will never recognize the coercive actions of the United States, Britain, and France against West Germany by the Adenauer group as legitimate. The broad masses of West Germany are increasingly aware that if Germany is to survive and achieve unity and peace, Adenauer must be overthrown and the "General Treaty" must be abolished.

Pieck said: In order for the German Democratic Republic to fulfill its great task in the struggle for peace, it must be consolidated in all aspects. This requires: (1) Intensifying economic construction and ensuring the overfulfillment of economic plans. (2) Establishing and consolidating state organs to bring them closer to the masses. (3) Carrying out a widespread propaganda campaign to publicize our democratic achievements, socialist construction, and the possibilities for the development of the people of the Republic in all aspects, and to promote the united action of the working masses. (4) Raising the vigilance of the masses and resolutely extinguishing any sabotage plots against the economic plans and democratic laws of the Republic.

(5) Overcoming complacency and opposing the underestimation of the seriousness of the hostile propaganda and sabotage of the war-mongers and their agents. Resolutely fight to the end against their bad elements and supporters. (6) Strengthening and supporting the state security organs by all means, so that they gain the trust and cooperation of the working people in order to stop all enemy plots. (7) Establishing an armed defense force sufficient to ensure the security of the Republic and protect it from external aggression. It is necessary to intensify the explanation to the people of the necessity of armed defense of the achievements of the Republic.

Pieck concluded: "The security and defense of our Republic is an integral part of the struggle for world peace. To this end, all necessary measures must be taken so that we can thwart all provocations. The young people of our Republic who are suitable for military service and all working people must gloriously complete this noble task. All the efforts of our Party must make the armed forces of our Republic a fortress of peace, a fortress of international friendship, and a fortress of the socialist future of human happiness."

    皮克在德国统一社会党代表会议上演说
    号召德国人民争取和平保卫祖国
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德国统一社会党主席皮克十日在统一社会党第二届代表会议上发表演说，谴责西德“总理”阿登纳和西方国家签订的“一般性条约”和欧洲军条约，说明德国人民争取和平和保卫德意志民主共和国的新任务。
    皮克首先说：希特勒法西斯主义被击败后已经七年多了，但是德国仍然分裂着，没有得到和约。这种情况是完全不能容忍的。德国人民有权要求恢复正常生活状况，恢复德国为一个统一、民主、和平、独立的国家。德国人民有权缔结这样的和约，使得在缔约以后，一切占领军都撤出德国，而由德国国防军负责保卫民主德国的边疆。
    皮克接着说：德国人民愿与一切国家建立正常关系，和平合作。因此他们反对把德国拉进侵略性的集团。德国人民认为：德国必须享有与其他国家平等的权利，必须有权参与和平解决一切有关欧洲和世界政策的问题。德国人民认为，对于德国和平经济的发展，绝对不容加以任何限制。这些就是德国人民基本的民族要求。
    皮克指出：苏联的对德和约原则草案旨在实现德国人民的一切民族要求。但是，波恩的叛国者及其美国与西德大公司的主子们拒绝满足德国人民的民族要求，相反地，却签订了战争性的“一般性条约”和欧洲军条约。
    皮克宣布：德国人民决不承认美英法三国与阿登纳集团对于西德的胁迫行为是合法的。西德广大群众已愈来愈认识：假如德国要生存并且要实现统一与和平，就必须打倒阿登纳，取消“一般性条约”。
    皮克说：为了使德意志民主共和国在争取和平的斗争中实现其伟大的任务，必须在各方面巩固它。这就必须：（一）加紧进行经济建设，保证超额完成经济计划。（二）建立和巩固国家机构，使它更密切地联系群众。（三）进行普遍的宣传运动，宣传我国的民主成就，宣传社会主义建设以及共和国人民各方面发展的可能性，并促成劳动群众的统一行动。（四）提高群众的警惕性，坚决扑灭对共和国经济计划和民主法律所进行的任何破坏阴谋。
    （五）克服麻痹思想，反对低估战争制造者及其代理人的敌对宣传和破坏的严重性。坚决和支持他们的坏分子斗争到底。（六）以一切办法加强与支持国家安全机构，使它们获得劳动人民的信赖与合作，以制止敌人一切阴谋。（七）建立一支足以保障共和国安全使其免受外界侵害的武装防御部队。必须在人民群众中间加紧说明武装保卫共和国成就的必要性。
    皮克在结语中说：“我们共和国的安全与防务是争取世界和平斗争中的一个组成部分。为此，必须采取一切必要的措施，使我们可以挫败一切挑衅行为。必须使我们共和国内适宜于参加服军役的青年和一切劳动人民光荣地完成这个崇高的任务。我们党的一切努力必须使我们共和国的武装部队成为和平的堡垒、国际友谊的堡垒和人类幸福的社会主义前途的堡垒。”
