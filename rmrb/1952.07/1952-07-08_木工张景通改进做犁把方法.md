    Carpenter Zhang Jingtong Improves Plow Handle Making Method

    Editor: Our factory's Comrade Zhang Jingtong is a very experienced carpenter in the carpentry shop. He exceeds and completes his tasks ahead of schedule every month. He was transferred to the finished product group at the beginning of January this year. When he started making plow handles, he made more than seventy a day, while others could only make fifty or so at most. Although he made more than others, he was not proud and was not satisfied, and continued to work hard to study. In the middle of this month, his highest daily output of plow handles has reached 217, and he finished an hour early. He is also more relaxed than others when he works. From placing the materials to completing the work, everything is very methodical, not putting things in a mess or moving them around randomly, which saves a lot of unnecessary non-production time and increases direct production time. When scraping the curve of the plow handle, others would just clamp it on the wooden chuck and scrape it, regardless of whether it was concave or convex. Comrade Zhang Jingtong, however, studied it carefully first before scraping it. When sharpening the plane blade, he sharpens two at once; if this one is not sharp enough, he immediately switches to the other one, saving time.

    木工张景通改进做犁把方法
    编辑同志：我厂张景通同志，是木工场很有经验的木工。他每月都超额提前完成任务。他是今年一月初调到成活组的。在开始做犁把的时候，他每天做七十多根，而别人最多只能做五十多根。他虽然比别人做的多，但是毫不骄傲，不满足，还继续努力钻研。本月中旬，他做犁把的最高日产量已达到二百一十七根，还提前一小时完成。他在工作的时候也比别人轻松。他从放材料到完成工作，都是很有规律的，不乱放，不乱挪，节省了好多不必要的非生产时间，增加了直接生产时间。在刮犁把弯的时候，别人不管凹、凸面，只要把它夹在木卡子上就刮，张景通同志却先研究好了，以后才刮。他在磨刨刃时，一起磨出两块；这块使的不快了，马上就换那块，节省了时间。
