    Should Cherish the Time of Drilling Workers
    Editor: We are drilling workers from the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. We want to expose the bureaucratic style of some cadres in the No. 2 Mine of our bureau. When we were carrying out drilling work in the No. 1 Mine, Engineer Guo of the No. 2 Mine told the leadership that the No. 2 Mine urgently needed drilling, and the positions for the boreholes had already been prepared. So, we were transferred to the No. 2 Mine. However, the borehole positions underground in the No. 2 Mine were not ready. After the first borehole was completed, we stopped for two or three days, and the second borehole was still not ready. We raised our opinions to Section Chief Suo, saying that the No. 1 Mine always had the mine prepare the borehole positions before letting us drill. Section Chief Suo actually replied, "No. 1 Mine is No. 1 Mine, No. 2 Mine is No. 2 Mine. The section chief of No. 1 Mine is a level one section chief, and the section chief of No. 2 Mine is a level two section chief. The ten fingers on a hand are not all the same length." How irresponsible this is! Because they did not lead the workers well in preparing the borehole positions, our eighteen drilling workers have wasted twelve days of time. According to the current efficiency quota calculation, the state has lost 29,240 catties of grain. Now, this problem has not been resolved, and we still have to wait for the designated borehole positions. Our mining area is carrying out a vigorous and large-scale competition, and our drilling workers are striving to learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi team. However, the bureaucratic and dragging style of these cadres prevents us from moving forward. We request the leadership to solve this problem.

    应该爱惜钻探工人的时间
    编辑同志：我们是峰峰矿务局的钻探工人。我们要揭发我局二矿有些干部的官僚主义作风。当我们在一矿进行钻探工作时，二矿的郭工程师向领导方面说是二矿急需钻探，钻孔的位置都已经准备好了，于是把我们调到二矿去了。可是二矿井下的钻眼位置并没有准备好。等到第一个钻孔打完，又停了两三天，第二个钻孔还是没有准备好。我们就向一位索科长提意见，说一矿总是矿方先准备好钻孔位置才让我们打钻。索科长竟然回答说：“一矿是一矿，二矿是二矿，一矿的科长是一级科长，二矿的科长是二级科长，十个手指头伸出来也不一样齐。”这话是多么不负责任呀！因为他们没有很好领导工人准备钻眼位置，我们十八个钻探工人已白白浪费了十二天时间。根据现在的效率定额计算，国家就损失二万九千二百四十斤粮食。现在，这个问题还没有解决，我们还得等指定钻孔位置。我们矿区正在开展轰轰烈烈的大竞赛，我们钻探工人正在努力学习马文志小组的先进经验。但是，这些干部的官僚主义拖拉作风却使我们不能前进，我们要求领导方面解决这个问题。    王益谦  江好学  史书业
