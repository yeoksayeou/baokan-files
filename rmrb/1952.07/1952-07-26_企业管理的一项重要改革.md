A Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    After the unfolding of the "full load, exceeding axle weight, and five hundred kilometers" movement, railway transportation work has seen significant improvements. However, due to imbalances in the progress of various departments, some new contradictions have emerged. On the one hand, freight loading capacity has increased, and transportation capacity has been enhanced, but on the other hand, there is a shortage of freight sources, leading to incomplete loading quotas. On the one hand, the efficiency of locomotives and vehicles has improved, while on the other hand, there is a surplus of labor, locomotives, and vehicles. Some units have taken a big step forward, while others have not kept up. These contradictory phenomena are inevitable in the forward development of people's enterprises. They indicate that new problems have arisen in the people's railway's movement for increased production and thrift, requiring us to implement new reforms in enterprise management methods to adapt to the rapidly developing productive forces, so as to better utilize the role of various advanced experiences and further improve transportation efficiency. Formulating and implementing tight schedules is the most effective way to solve these contradictions.

    Implementing tight schedules, on the one hand, can strengthen the organization and planning of transportation management, enabling leaders to clearly understand the freight situation and effectively grasp the laws of freight flow and vehicle flow. This will enable them to regulate the uncoordinated situation between departments and units in a planned and organized manner, so that all units and all railway workers can carry out production in a balanced and rhythmic manner. On the other hand, because tight schedules are built on the basis of advanced operating indicators, they can fully utilize the capacity of equipment, continuously improve the technical level and labor productivity of workers, further organize and promote advanced production experiences, and make the "full load, exceeding axle weight, and five hundred kilometers" movement develop steadily and rapidly, leading railway work to a more progressive direction.

    All railway bureaus across the country must conscientiously formulate and implement tight schedules. Leading cadres of other enterprises should also learn from this new management method of the railway system to further improve the operation and management of various industrial systems.

    企业管理的一项重要改革
    开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动后，铁路运输工作已有显著改进，可是由于各部门工作进度不平衡，也就产生了一些新的矛盾的现象：一方面提高了货物装载量，增强了运输能力，而另一方面却缺少货源，完不成装车数；一方面提高了机车和车辆的运用效率，而另一方面却又多余了劳动力和机车、车辆；有些单位前进了很大一步，而另一些单位还未跟上来。这种矛盾现象，正是人民企业向前发展的不可避免的现象。它说明人民铁道的增产节约运动出现了新的问题，要求我们企业管理方法必须进行新的改革，使它能够适应于迅速发展着的生产力，以便更好地发挥各种先进经验的作用，进一步提高运输效率。制定和实行紧密运行图，就是为了解决这些矛盾的最有效的方法。
    实行紧密运行图，一方面可以加强运输管理中的组织性和计划性，使领导者能够清楚地了解货运情况，有效地掌握货流、车流的规律，从而有计划有组织地调节各部门、各单位之间不协调的状况，使各单位和全体铁路职工能平衡地有节奏地进行生产。另一方面，因为紧密运行图是建筑在先进作业指标的基础之上的，所以它就可以充分发挥设备的能力，不断地提高职工的技术水平和劳动生产率，进一步组织和推广先进生产经验，使得满载、超轴、五百公里运动稳步而迅速地开展，把铁路工作引向更进步的发展方向去。
    全国各铁路局必须认真地制定和实行紧密运行图，其他企业领导干部，也应该学习铁道系统这个新的管理方法，进一步提高各产业系统的经营管理工作。
