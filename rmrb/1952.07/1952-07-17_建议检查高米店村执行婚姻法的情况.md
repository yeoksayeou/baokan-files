    Suggest Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Gaomi Dian Village
    Editor: In Gaomi Dian Village, Third District, Daxing County, Hebei Province, many village cadres still deliberately violate the Marriage Law. For example, village cadre Wang Wenxi, in order to obtain 1.5 million yuan in "bride price," actually married his daughter, who was around twenty years old, to a man who was nearly fifty years old. When his daughter disagreed, he threatened her, saying, "If you don't agree, I'll kick you out." The daughter had no choice but to marry him against her will. Village head Wang Tingxiang also has violated the Marriage Law. His wife likes to "visit around," and instead of educating her, he beats or scolds her. The Party and government cadres in the village not only do not correct these situations, but even express support for them, which has a negative impact on the masses.
    I suggest that the Daxing County People's Government inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law in Gaomi Dian Village. Lan Sheng

### 建议检查高米店村执行婚姻法的情况

    建议检查高米店村执行婚姻法的情况
    编辑同志：河北省大兴县三区高米店村仍有很多村干部故意违犯婚姻法。如村干部王文喜，为了得到一百五十万元的“彩礼”，竟把二十岁左右的女儿嫁给了一个将近五十岁的男人。女儿不同意，他威胁女儿说：“不同意就赶你出去。”女儿也只好委屈地嫁了过去。村长王廷祥也有违反婚姻法的事实。他老婆喜欢“串门”，他不是教育她，而是打她或骂她。以上这些情况，村里的党、政干部不但不加以纠正，反而有表示支持的，这在群众中造成不好的影响。
    我建议大兴县人民政府检查高米店村执行婚姻法的情况。 岚生
