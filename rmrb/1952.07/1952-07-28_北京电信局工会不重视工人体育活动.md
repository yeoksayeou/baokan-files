To the Editor:

The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union has long neglected workers' sports activities. Last August, when the Telecommunications Bureau was building a new building, the only basketball court in the bureau was piled with wooden boards and steel bars. The staff requested the trade union to negotiate with the administration to free up the court (as there was still a lot of open space), but the trade union ignored it. Workers also asked the trade union to borrow courts from nearby Beijing Normal University, etc., but the trade union also refused this suggestion. Although the trade union has a "Sports Preparatory Committee" organization, it is merely a name and does not solve any problems. In the 1951 winter National Defense Cup basketball game, the Telecommunications Bureau did not select a representative team to participate. The workers formed their own team to participate, but the trade union did not give any help or encouragement. Recently, the Jingdian United Team of the Telecommunications Bureau competed with other teams and asked the trade union to borrow twelve sets of clothes, but it was also refused. However, the trade union has accumulated twenty sets of sportswear, which have not been used to date. The Telecommunications Bureau's football team is also formed by the workers themselves, and the trade union has not provided good assistance. The All-China Sports Federation has called on the people of the whole country to exercise and defend the motherland. But this call has not aroused the attention of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union.

    北京电信局工会不重视工人体育活动
    编辑同志：北京电信局工会长期地不重视工人的体育活动。去年八月，电信局修盖楼房时，曾把局内仅有的一个篮球场堆了木板和铁筋，职工要求工会向行政交涉，腾出球场（因空地还很多），工会不理会。工人又要求工会向附近的北京师范大学等借用球场，工会也拒绝了这个意见。工会虽有“体育筹备委员会”的组织，但徒有其名，不解决问题。在一九五一年冬季举行国防杯篮球赛，电信局没有选出代表队参加。工人自己组成球队参加，工会没有给予任何的帮助和鼓励。最近电信局的京电联队与别的球队比赛，曾向工会借用十二套衣服，也被拒绝了。但工会积存了二十套运动衣，迄今没有利用。电信局的足球队也是工人自己组成的，工会也没有很好地帮助。中华全国体育总会曾号召全国人民锻炼身体，保卫祖国。但这个号召没有引起北京电信局工会的重视。  琴岗
