    Telegraph Service Opens Between Chongqing and Lhasa
    On July 1st, the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau officially opened telegraph service between Chongqing and Lhasa, with good communication. Due to inconvenient transportation between Tibet and the mainland, the opening of telegraph service has greatly strengthened connections. Recently, many people have been sending telegrams. Chongqing receives many telegrams from Lhasa every day, and many telegrams are transferred through Chongqing to places like Xi'an. Currently, the Southwest Postal and Telecommunications Administration is preparing to expand its services and plans to open telegraph services between Chengdu, Kangding, and other places with Lhasa. A batch of telecommunications equipment and materials allocated by the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau to Tibet is now being transported to Lhasa.

    重庆拉萨间电报业务开放
    重庆电信局在“七一”中国共产党成立三十一周年纪念日，已正式开放了重庆和拉萨间的电报业务，通报情况良好。西藏和内地间交通不便，电报开放后，大大增强了联系。近日来拍发电报的人很多，重庆每天都收到许多从拉萨发来的电报，并有很多电报是经重庆转往西安等地的。现在，西南邮电管理局正准备扩展业务，计划开放成都、康定等地和拉萨间的电报业务。由重庆电信局拨往西藏的一批电讯设备器材，现正运往拉萨。
