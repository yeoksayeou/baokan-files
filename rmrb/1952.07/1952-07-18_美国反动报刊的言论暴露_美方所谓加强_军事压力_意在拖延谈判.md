Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: While righteous public opinion around the world is unanimously calling for a swift end to the bloodshed in Korea, many reactionary bourgeois newspapers in the United States are openly advocating the adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure." These statements nakedly expose the despicable aim of the American aggressors in recently carrying out a series of frenzied bombings of peaceful facilities in Korea.

On July 4th, the very day the administrative meeting of the delegation of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations began, the Tokyo dispatch of "U.S. News & World Report" blatantly stated: "There is no other way than to apply more military pressure, and despite the loud complaints of some of America's allies, this pressure will be used." On June 28th, "Business Week's" international outlook column, in discussing America's "new tough policy," wrote: "There is nothing to lose by taking a tough stance." The paper also revealed: "The number of future bombings of North Korean industrial targets may increase, and ground combat may be intensified." On June 27th, "Washington Star" reporter Brown, in discussing the bombing of the Yalu River power plants, said: "Similar strikes and offensive actions, whether allied politicians like it or not, will be carried out more often." American reactionary military commentator Baldwin, in an article published in the "New York Times" on June 26th, also unreservedly admitted that the U.S. air raids on the Yalu River power plants were a means by which the U.S. side attempted to increase pressure on our side. He said: "These air raids are undoubtedly the first step in a plan" to increase pressure on the enemy.

The "Wall Street Journal," representing American financial groups, in a Washington dispatch on June 25th, more blatantly exposed the U.S. side's deliberate conspiracy to delay negotiations. The paper said: "A formal armistice is needed, but it is not necessarily a very meaningful thing, because even with an armistice, it will take a long time for American soldiers to be able to withdraw from Korea," and "we cannot and will not abandon the principle of voluntary repatriation for Chinese and North Korean prisoners." Therefore, the paper believes that "a selectable path" is to "exert maximum military pressure on Korea and also exert military pressure on China."

From this, one can clearly see what the true purpose of the two-faced tactics played by the American aggressors in the recent Korean armistice negotiations is. However, the American aggressors' foolish adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure" is doomed to bankruptcy. The "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive" launched by the American aggressors during the negotiations last year suffered tragic failures under the strong blows of the Korean and Chinese people. And the U.S. Air Force's wanton bombing of peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, in addition to exposing the cruelty of the aggressors, cannot change the "stalemate" in which the aggressors are mired militarily. The "Hindustan Times" pointed out on the 15th, in commenting on the U.S. air raids on the rear of Korea, that the U.S. attempt to influence negotiations through bombing "is actually playing with fire" and "will only arouse anger and hatred."

### 美国反动报刊的言论暴露  美方所谓加强“军事压力”意在拖延谈判

    美国反动报刊的言论暴露
    美方所谓加强“军事压力”意在拖延谈判
    【新华社开城十七日电】在全世界正直的舆论一致要求迅速终止朝鲜流血的时候，美国许多反动的资产阶级报刊却在公开鼓吹所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策。这些言论赤裸裸地暴露了美国侵略者最近对朝鲜和平设施实行一系列狂轰滥炸的卑鄙目的。
    七月四日，即在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会行政性会议开始的一天，“美国新闻与世界报道”的东京电讯就露骨地提出：“除了施用更多的军事压力以外，没有其他的办法了，尽管美国某些盟国高声的埋怨，这种压力是会要使用的。”六月二十八日，美国“商业周刊”的国际展望栏在谈到美国的“新的强硬政策”时写道：“采取强硬态度是一无所损的。”该报并透露：“将来轰炸北朝鲜工业目标的次数可能增多，或许还要加紧地面战斗。”六月二十七日，“华盛顿明星报”记者布朗在谈到轰炸鸭绿江发电厂时说：“类似的打击和进攻行动，不管盟国的政治家们愿意不愿意，会要更多地进行的。”美国反动的军事评论员鲍尔温六月二十六日在“纽约时报”发表文章，也毫不隐讳地承认美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂是美方企图对我方增加压力的手段，他说：“这些空袭无疑地是一个增加对敌压力”的
    “计划的第一步”。代表美国财阀的“华尔街日报”在六月二十五日的一篇华盛顿通讯中，更露骨地暴露了美方蓄意拖延谈判的阴谋。该报说：“一个正式的停战是需要的，但却不一定是很有意义的事情，因为即使有了停战，要美国士兵能够撤出朝鲜，那还得一段长的时间”，而且“我们不能够也不愿意放弃对于中国和北朝鲜俘虏的自愿遣返原则。”因此该报认为“一条可以选择的道路”就是“对朝鲜施行最大的军事压力，对中国也施用军事压力”。
    人们从这里可以清楚地看出：美国侵略者在最近的朝鲜停战谈判中玩弄的两面手法的真正目的是什么。但是，美国侵略者这种愚蠢的所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策，是注定要破产的。美国侵略者去年在谈判期间所发动的“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”，都在朝中人民的坚强打击下遭受了悲惨的失败。而美国空军对朝鲜后方和平居民、和平设施的滥肆轰炸，除了暴露侵略者的残忍外，是改变不了侵略者在军事上所陷入的“僵局”的。“印度斯坦时报”十五日在评论美机对朝鲜后方的野蛮轰炸时指出：美国企图以轰炸来影响谈判的行为，“其实是在玩火”，“它只会引起愤怒和憎恨而已”。
