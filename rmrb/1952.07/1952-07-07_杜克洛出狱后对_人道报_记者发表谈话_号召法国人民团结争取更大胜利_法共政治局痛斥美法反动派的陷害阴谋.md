Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: According to TASS, Paris: "L'Humanité" published on the 3rd an interview with French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos following his release from prison.

Duclos said: The Court of Appeals' decision to order his immediate release due to lack of grounds for arrest is a major victory for the cause of peace and freedom. This is a victory for the people of the world, whose deeply moving expressions of solidarity and fraternal support for the French people encouraged us in prison; it also underscores the unparalleled strength of the world peace camp, led by the great socialist country. This is a victory for the French working class and the people, who have seen how dangerous the "plot" of Debray and "Brunet & Co." is to democratic freedoms and peace (Note: Debray is the French Minister of Justice, Brunet is the Minister of the Interior).

I deeply thank the Socialists, democrats of all stripes, Catholics, and the entire people, whose united action against the government's repressive measures and to block the path of fascism and war has been all the more effective. The Court of Appeals' decision shows that the widespread hatred of injustice by the broad masses of the people is increasingly influencing all sectors, including the judiciary. This fully demonstrates that, if we are united, we have a great possibility of saving France from the taint of fascism and the horrors of a new war.

The government has been given a resounding slap in the face by the Court of Appeals' decision. There is no doubt that it will try to retaliate. However, it is clear that Debray and Brunet's credibility has now been bankrupt in the eyes of the public, as has Baylot (Note: Paris Police Commissioner), not to mention Jacquinot and Aydaillot (Note: those responsible for fabricating Duclos' "evidence"). By declaring my arrest illegal, the French judges have exposed the crimes of those who ordered my arrest and illegally imprisoned me. Now, just as we have one by one destroyed and refuted some of the "evidence" of the so-called "plot" charges initially brought, we must completely destroy everything put forward to replace these "evidence". I firmly reiterate: Those who invented these "plots" lied shamelessly. Their so-called files are as nonsensical as the "caught red-handed" charges they used to attack me.

We have achieved an initial victory; we can and must continue to achieve new and major victories. Duclos emphasized: The French people must do everything possible to restore freedom to "L'Humanité" editor-in-chief Stil, who is still being illegally imprisoned, and to all patriots, to completely shatter the authorities' frame-up plot, and to release Henri Martin, the young peace fighter sentenced to imprisonment for opposing the massacre of the Vietnamese people.

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: TASS, Paris, July 5th: The French Communist Party Politburo issued a statement on July 4 regarding Duclos' release. The statement emphasized that the Court of Appeals' ruling to release Duclos is a great victory for the cause of freedom and peace—a victory won by the French people with the active support of peace-loving people in all countries of the world. The statement said that it is now clear that the "plot" fabricated by Debray and Brunet, under the leadership of Vichyite Binet, is nothing more than a clumsy police frame-up instigated and directed by the American occupiers. It is only because Debray and Brunet submit to the Americans' war policy that they dare to fabricate false "plots" to frame the Communists, with the sole purpose of crushing the people's movement against war by suppressing democratic freedoms.

The French Communist Party Politburo calls on all party organizations at all levels to do everything in their power to unite the freedom- and peace-loving French people to fight for the immediate release of Stil and all patriotic individuals imprisoned for defending peace, freedom, and national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: TASS, Paris, July 5th: According to "L'Humanité," many patriotic French citizens joined the French Communist Party during the period of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos' illegal detention. More than a thousand people joined the Communist Party in the Seine department, 435 in the Seine-et-Oise department, and 323 in the Nord department. "L'Humanité" pointed out: "This is a splendid answer from the French people to the likes of Debray, Brunet, and Binet, who intend to isolate the Communists from French patriots."

    杜克洛出狱后对“人道报”记者发表谈话
    号召法国人民团结争取更大胜利
    法共政治局痛斥美法反动派的陷害阴谋
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：“人道报”在三日登载了法国共产党书记杜克洛出狱后对该报记者的谈话。
    杜克洛说：这次上诉法庭因无逮捕根据判决立即开释的决定，是和平与自由事业的一个重大胜利。这是全世界人民的胜利，他们令人深深感动地表示了他们对法国人民的手足之谊和声援，使我们在狱中感到鼓舞；同时这也强调说明了以伟大的社会主义国家为首的世界和平阵营的无比的力量。这是法国工人阶级和人民的胜利，他们已经看到德勃拉和“布吕纳公司”的“阴谋”对民主自由与和平有多么大的危险（按：德勃拉是法国司法部长，布吕纳是内政部长）。
    我深深感谢社会党人、各派民主分子、天主教人士和全体人民，由于他们反对政府的镇压措施，人民大众堵住法西斯主义和战争的道路的团结行动才有了更大的效力。上诉法庭的决定说明了广大人民群众对非正义的憎恨正在愈来愈广泛地影响到各界人士，司法界人士也不例外。这就充分地说明了，只要我们团结一致，我们就有巨大的可能挽救法国免受法西斯主义的玷辱和新战争的恐怖。
    政府这次被上诉法庭的决定打了一记响亮的耳光。毫无疑问，它是要想法报复的。但是，很明显，现在德勃拉和布吕纳的信用已经在大众面前破了产，贝娄（按：巴黎警察厅长）也是一样，更不要说雅基诺和艾达罗了（按：负责制造杜克洛的“罪证”的人）。法国法官宣布对我的逮捕是非法的，这样，他们就说明了那些下令逮捕我并且非法地把我关在牢里的人的罪恶。现在，就像我们一个接一个地摧毁和驳斥了当初所提出来的所谓“阴谋”罪名的一些“根据”一样，我们必须把一切为替换这些“根据”而提出来的东西也摧毁无余。我坚决地再说一遍：发明这些“阴谋”的人无耻地撒了谎。他们的所谓案卷也和他们用来攻击我的“当场捕获”的罪名一样是胡说。
    我们获得了初步胜利；我们可以而且必须继续取得新的重大的胜利。杜克洛强调：法国人民一定要尽一切力量，使仍然被非法囚禁的“人道报”总编辑斯梯和一切爱国者恢复自由，使当局的诬陷阴谋彻底破产，并且要使因反对屠杀越南人民而被判处徒刑的青年和平战士亨利·马丁获得释放。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：法国共产党政治局于七月四日就杜克洛恢复自由一事发表声明。声明着重指出，上诉法院的释放杜克洛的裁决是自由与和平事业的一个巨大胜利——这是法国人民在全世界争取和平的各国人民的积极支援下所赢得的胜利。声明说，事实已很明显，在维希分子比内领导下的德勃拉和布吕纳先生们所捏造出来的
    “阴谋”，只不过是美国占领者所教唆和指挥的一种笨拙的警察陷害手段。只是因为德勃拉和布吕纳先生们屈从美国人的战争政策，他们才敢捏造假
    “阴谋”来陷害共产党人，这种做法的唯一目的是要以取缔民主自由权利来粉碎人民反对战争的运动。
    法国共产党政治局要求全党各级组织竭尽全力使爱好自由与和平的法国人民团结起来，争取立即释放斯梯以及一切因保卫和平、自由与民族独立而被囚禁的爱国人士。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：据“人道报”报道：在法国共产党书记杜克洛被非法拘禁期间，许多法国爱国志士加入了法国共产党。塞纳省加入共产党的有一千人以上，塞纳—瓦斯省有四百三十五人，诺尔省有三百二十三人。“人道报”指出：“这是法国人民对于打算把共产党人孤立于法国爱国人士之外的德勃拉、布吕纳和比内之辈的绝妙的答复。”
