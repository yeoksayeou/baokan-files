Xinhua News Agency, July 11th, Rangoon: The Burmese delegation, which attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, told reporters upon returning to Rangoon that the convening of this preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference strengthened the confidence of the people of the world in striving for peace. Although the representatives of various countries attending the meeting differed in race, language, and religious beliefs, their confidence in striving for peace was consistent. In the meeting, the representatives not only understood the situation and experience of the people of various countries in struggling for peace, but also passed declarations and proposals, which opened up a brighter path for the peace movement of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions in the future. This meeting is a symbol of the great unity of peace-loving people in the Asian and Pacific regions, and fully illustrates that no matter how imperialism provokes war and undermines peace, the forces of peace will surely win. This meeting brought full confidence to the Burmese people in the struggle for peace. The Burmese people will always stand together with peace-loving people of all countries and fight to defend peace.

　　U Aye Gyi, a member of the delegation, particularly emphasized the crime of the US imperialism in conducting germ warfare. After describing his visit to the exhibition of the crimes of the US imperialism in germ warfare in Beijing, he said: From the US imperialism's manufacture of germ weapons to the written confessions and recordings of captured American airmen admitting to dropping germ bombs, these are all ironclad facts. No matter how the US imperialism quibbles, its murderous crimes cannot be concealed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 16th, Karachi: Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Vice-Chairman of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, who returned to Pakistan after attending the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, issued a written statement to reporters in Karachi on July 6th, stating that the preparatory meeting "marks a great milestone in the global struggle for peace." After briefly introducing the agenda to be discussed at the formal meeting, he said that the meeting possessed "the enthusiasm and spirit to jointly strive to banish the demon of war and defend peace. Pakistan, this young country, has countless problems to be solved, so peace is its most urgent need. I firmly believe that the people and government of Pakistan will fully support this upcoming conference and make it a success, thereby creating conditions for the progress and prosperity of Asia."

　　When talking about his impressions of visiting China, Ghulam Muhammad Khan said: "After the preparatory meeting, I had the opportunity to visit many places in China. What impressed me the most and is unforgettable is the radiant faces of the Chinese youth. Inspired by new life, Chinese youth are confidently engaged in the construction of New China. I also met people representing the broadest strata of China. A deep hatred for aggressive war and a deep love for peace have become the theme of their lives. They universally want to understand their Asian neighbors and establish lasting friendships with them."

　　In his talk, he particularly introduced how land reform has completely changed the face of the Chinese countryside and how the Chinese people love Chairman Mao. He also introduced the rapid construction work of New China. He said: Factories, hospitals, schools, nurseries, cultural palaces, workers' sanatoriums, etc. are appearing everywhere in New China like bamboo shoots after a rain. Regarding the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, he said: "This great construction will not only prevent the Yangtze River from flooding, but will also turn large tracts of barren land into fertile fields."

　　Ghulam Muhammad Khan concluded: "I believe that closer economic and cultural relations between Pakistan and China will bring great benefits to both countries."
