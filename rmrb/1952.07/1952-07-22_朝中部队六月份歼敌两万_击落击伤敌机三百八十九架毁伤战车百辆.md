Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 21st: June was the month with the most intense fighting on the Korean battlefield in the first half of this year. The American aggressors, deliberately delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, increased their ground forces' incursions and the air force's indiscriminate bombing during this month. Anglo-American invading forces launched 116 incursions on the front line in June and four landing incursions on the west coast. Enemy troops fired an average of more than 30,000 shells every day. The Korean and Chinese People's Army victoriously crushed all enemy attacks and inflicted the largest casualties on the enemy in June since January of this year, with 20,095 enemy troops annihilated, including 11,220 American aggressors.

During the fierce fighting in June, the warriors of the Korean and Chinese People's Army displayed unparalleled heroic fighting spirit. Sometimes, after inflicting serious casualties on the enemy with field fortifications, they moved into tunnel fortifications to continue fighting, coordinating with our counter-attacking troops to severely damage the enemy. In the battles near Height 190.8 west of Tieyuan from June 12th to 15th, our army annihilated more than 1,400 officers and soldiers of the 180th Regiment of the US 45th Division by combining blocking, tunnel defense, and counter-attack tactics. In the battle on a small hill west of Guantae-ri, southeast of Kimhwa, our army inflicted a devastating blow on the 2nd Regiment of the Rhee puppet 6th Division. During the battle, two squads of our army killed a large number of enemy troops and then moved into nearby tunnels to defend, fighting continuously for ten days and nights, and finally cooperated with our counter-attacking troops to completely wipe out a company of enemy troops entrenched on the hilltop.

In many battles, the Korean and Chinese People's artillery units increasingly demonstrated their powerful might, inflicting heavy casualties on the invading enemy and destroying many enemy cannons, tanks, bunkers, and ammunition depots.

Since June, the American aggressors have continued to wage germ warfare and chemical warfare in Korea, and have frantically directed their air force to carry out more barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and towns in Korea than in the past. After the US Air Force indiscriminately bombed the Supung Dam and several power plants in North Korea, which are closely related to the lives of the Korean and Chinese people, on June 23rd, it indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang and its surrounding areas on July 11th, massacring peaceful residents and destroying residential and public buildings. On the same day, US aircraft also invaded our country's Northeast airspace and strafed indiscriminately in Andong City, causing a serious incident in which 52 of our people were killed and injured. The American aggressors' evil actions of deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations and expanding the war have aroused even greater hatred of the enemy among the Korean and Chinese people, and have further aroused the high vigilance of the Korean and Chinese people against the enemy's new conspiracies.

The Korean and Chinese People's forces, filled with intense anger, launched anti-aircraft gunnery battles, giving the American aerial bandits severe punishment. In June, the Korean and Chinese People's ground forces and air force units shot down and damaged a total of 389 enemy aircraft.

The results of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in June are as follows (incomplete statistics):

一. Annihilated 20,095 enemy troops, including 11,220 American troops, 106 British troops, 189 Canadian troops, 87 Turkish troops, and 8,493 Rhee puppet troops.

二. Major captures: 1 tank, 7 anti-aircraft machine guns, 114 light and heavy machine guns, 8 flamethrowers, 520 various rifles, 10 radios, 66 various communication devices.

三. Shot down 159 enemy aircraft, damaged 230 enemy aircraft. Destroyed 81 enemy tanks, damaged 19 enemy tanks. Destroyed 109 enemy artillery pieces, destroyed 77 enemy vehicles.

    朝中部队六月份歼敌两万
    击落击伤敌机三百八十九架毁伤战车百辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】六月份是今年上半年朝鲜战场上战斗最激烈的一个月。蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判的美国侵略者，在这个月里增加了他们地面部队的进犯行动和空军的滥肆轰炸。美英侵略军六月份在正面战线进犯一百十六次，并在西海岸进行四次登陆窜犯。敌军每天平均发炮达三万发以上。朝中人民军队胜利地粉碎了敌军的所有进攻，并使敌军在六月份中遭到今年一月以来最大的伤亡，计敌军被歼两万零九十五名，其中美国侵略军占一万一千二百二十名。
    在六月份的激烈战斗中，朝中人民军队的勇士们发扬了无比英勇的作战精神。他们有时利用野战工事给予敌军以严重杀伤后转入坑道工事继续战斗，配合我军反击部队痛歼敌军。在六月十二日至十五日铁原以西一九零点八高地附近的战斗中，我军即以阻击、坑道坚守和反击相配合的战术，歼灭美军第四十五师一八零团官兵一千四百多名。在金城东南官垈里以西一个小高地的战斗中，我军予李伪军第六师第二团以歼灭性打击。在战斗时我军两个班在杀伤大量敌军后转入附近坑道坚守，连续战斗十昼夜，最后配合我军反击部队将盘据山头上的一个连敌军全部歼灭。
    在许多战斗中，朝中人民炮兵部队愈来愈发挥其强大威力，给予进犯敌军以惨重杀伤，并击毁敌军许多大炮、战车、地堡和弹药所。
    六月份以来，美国侵略者在朝鲜继续进行细菌战和化学战，并且疯狂地指挥其空军向朝鲜和平城乡进行比之过去更加野蛮的轰炸。美国空军继六月二十三日滥炸与朝中人民生活有密切关系的水丰发电厂及北朝鲜的几个发电厂之后，又在七月十一日滥炸平壤及其附近地区，屠杀和平居民，毁坏住宅及公共建筑物。美机并于同日侵入我国东北领空，在安东市滥行扫射，造成打死打伤我国人民五十二人的严重事件。美国侵略者蓄意破坏停战谈判，扩大战争的罪恶行动，激起了朝中人民对敌人更大的仇恨，并且更加引起朝中人民对敌人新的阴谋的高度警惕。
    朝中人民部队怀着强烈愤怒展开对空射击战，给予美国空中强盗以严厉的惩罚。六月份朝中人民地面部队及空军部队共击落击伤三百八十九架敌机。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军六月份战果如下（不完全统计）：
    一、歼灭敌军两万零九十五名，其中美军一万一千二百二十名，英军一百零六名，加拿大军一百八十九名，土耳其军八十七名，李伪军八千四百九十三名。
    二、主要缴获：战车一辆，高射机枪七挺，轻重机枪一百十四挺，火焰喷射器八具，各种枪五百二十枝，电台十部，各种通话机六十六部。
    三、击落敌机一百五十九架，击伤敌机二百三十架。击毁敌军战车八十一辆，击伤敌军战车十九辆。击毁敌军各种炮一百零九门，击毁敌军汽车七十七辆。
