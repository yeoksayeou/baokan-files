    Introducing "A History of American Aggression Against China" (Volume 1)
    By Qing Ruji. Published by Sanlian Bookstore, May 1952, First Edition.
    Wang Dabai
    Qing Ruji's "A History of American Aggression Against China" (Volume 1) is the book with the most abundant primary source materials among the published books on the same topic. This first volume covers the history of American aggression against China from 1784 to 1864.

    The Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia, signed in 1844 following the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing, marked the official beginning of American capitalist aggression against China. However, before this, American pirate-like merchants had already been plundering China for sixty years. This is the main content of the first section of the book. The author points out the bloody nature of early American capital accumulation. The agricultural capital groups in the southern and central United States started by seizing Native American lands, exploiting the labor of black slaves, and engaging in land speculation through bloody means. The commercial capital groups in New England relied on pirate-like looting and smuggling activities to become rich. They quickly set their sights on China, which was then regarded as the location of mankind's golden treasure trove.

    The first American merchant ship to arrive in Guangzhou in 1784 was a smuggler ship, a specialty of New England and New York. People followed one another to China to seek so-called "great opportunities". A single trip to Guangzhou could earn a profit of 400 to 500 percent. They exchanged drugs (opium), ginseng, furs, etc. for our silk and tea; they exploited the Chinese people by means of deception, plunder, and armed smuggling, and accumulated the wealth of the Chinese people into "numerous New England capitals." They themselves did not shy away from saying: "The adventurous spirit of coming to China for trade, regardless of the hardships of the long journey, comes from the experience of pirates."

    The author points out that American pirate-style bourgeois spokesmen try to make people believe that the United States did not engage in the despicable drug trade with China—the import and smuggling of opium. However, history shows that American merchants were completely the same as British merchants in this respect. The historical materials presented by the author confirm that as early as the beginning of the 20th century, there were American trading firms specializing in selling drugs to China, and almost "every merchant in Boston or Salem was like this." American merchants had clipper ships specializing in opium trade and undertaking armed smuggling. These ships were "fully armed", often "traveling swiftly day and night", firing guns and cannons to resist Chinese customs. An American, Morrison, wrote: "Even Christian missionaries do not object to this trade. ... They all say that opium is harmless to the Chinese, just as wine is harmless to Americans." This is really the height of shamelessness.

    The author correctly summarizes this stage of Sino-American relations, explaining that early American capital accumulation was written into the history of the Chinese people with "the language of blood and fire."

    The second section of the book discusses how the American bourgeoisie, after entering the stage of industrial capitalism, began to develop its aggression against our country. The focus of the discussion is on American policy during the Opium War and the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia in 1844.

    The author analyzes that after 1830, American textiles began to invade our market; after 1840, the content of American capitalist aggression against China changed—it was no longer the simple exploitation of commercial capital in the previous half-century, but entered the stage of industrial capital engaging in aggression in order to occupy and open up colonial markets. In the Opium War, the American bourgeoisie acted as a powerful accomplice. The American bourgeoisie warmly welcomed this bandit war, and one of its servants—the missionary Revis—shamelessly said: "This war has already been used, with God's blessing, to open up a new era in our relations with this vast empire."

    This "new era" began with the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia, which attempted to reduce China to a semi-colony of the United States. American government documents openly stated that this treaty "has placed American relations with China on a brand-new footing, which is extremely beneficial to the development of American commerce and other interests." This so-called "brand-new footing" is the so-called "open door" policy, which marks the international capitalist policy of jointly invading China in this period.

    Because the United States did not have relatively strong forces in the Pacific at that time, it particularly wanted to use the weapon of the open door policy to obtain benefits in the joint front of robbers who jointly plundered China. The author of this book says:
        "As far as the United States is concerned, since the Opium War began, it has consistently adopted such a policy of joint aggression. Whether it directly or indirectly
    participates in the war, or cunningly avoids the form of war, it is a de facto ally of all countries at war with China. Because, all victories in the war of aggression against China are equal to the victory of the United States. Conversely, in this process of capitalist international aggression against China, no matter what role the United States plays, its role is equally supported by other aggressors, because any victory of it is equal to the victory of other aggressive countries." (Pages 78-79 of this book)
    It is this "open door" policy of mutual benefit and mutual cyclic gain that has enabled the United States to obtain huge benefits.

    Since the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia, the American bourgeoisie has not only entered China in the posture of a conqueror, but also sold and abducted our working people to the West to do hard labor with the cruelty of slave owners—this is the "coolie trade" which began in the late 1840s and became one of the tragic pages in the history of the Chinese people after the opium trade. In this "trade", the savage and bloody profits obtained by the American pirate-style bourgeoisie could be as high as more than ten times the appalling figure. This is preserved in the archives of the US Congress with undisguisable records.

    "Expanding Aggression and Interfering in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution" is the third section of this book. This section talks about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement and the Second Opium War. Whether in the former or the latter, we can see the evil bloodstained hands of the American bourgeoisie. As the facts cited by the author point out: The United States at this time had only one purpose, which was to turn China into "a vast field of American enterprise, an endless market for American commerce" (words of the American envoy to China Marshall in 1853). Because this market is "more valuable than the sum of all the markets in the world that the United States can currently enter" (words of the envoy McLean in 1854). In order to achieve this goal, another American envoy to China, the missionary Bajia, once suggested "unrestricted development of trade with China in all parts of the Chinese empire" and even nakedly advocated that the international capitalist robbers of the United States, Britain, and France should jointly invade China with force. At this time, the United States, together with Britain and France, took advantage of the revolutionary situation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, first used military force to threaten the crumbling Qing rulers to obtain greater aggressive interests, and then assisted the Qing government in armed intervention in the Chinese revolution. The book narrates the policy of military provocation and military threats of the American rulers against China before the Second Opium War, and also points out that the United States assisted the aggressive advance of British and French robbers in the Second Opium War while using the posture of a mediator to win over and seek profits from it. The book also vividly records the crimes of the international looting team centered on the American rogue Ward, which was formed in 1860. The American Morse's book admits that these foreigners who helped the Qing government attack the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were "attracted by the prospect of looting."

    Apologists for American imperialism often try to make people believe that the hands of the United States were clean in the two Opium Wars. This book refutes this lie with sufficient facts. In the Second Opium War, as in the First Opium War, the reason why the United States did not come forward publicly was only because its power at that time was not enough to be the head of the gang of robbers in the Far East. Therefore, it could only use various cunning means of taking advantage of the fire and taking advantage of the situation to extort various rights and interests. Some studies on the history of Sino-American relations describe the United States as the protagonist in the aggression at that time in order to explain that the United States had also participated in the aggression against China in the early years, which is not in line with the facts. By saying this, one cannot correctly explain how the United States gradually sought hegemony over China after establishing aggressive strongholds in the Pacific. Although the book by Qing Ruji also has shortcomings in individual places that inappropriately portray the United States at that time as the protagonist of aggression against China, this book uses a lot of vivid materials to make people see that the United States did play an extremely despicable and shameful role in the joint aggressive actions of the powers against China, and its cunning and cruelty were by no means inferior to those of other old-brand pirate countries. In this regard, the book is very successful.

    The author of this book made extensive use of American government documents related to Sino-American relations, the speeches of American aggressors in China, and diplomatic documents of the Qing government, and made preliminary sorting and analysis to specifically expose the ferocious face of American imperialism and made several convincing conclusions. These explanations should be able to arouse every reader's unparalleled hatred for American aggressors and a high degree of vigilance. We hope that the author can engage in the writing of subsequent volumes with the same serious attitude as writing the first volume.

    介绍“美国侵华史”（第一卷）
    卿汝楫著  三联书店一九五二年五月初版
    王大白
    卿汝楫著“美国侵华史”（第一卷）一书，在已出版的同一主题的书籍中是掌握原始材料最丰富的一本。在这第一卷中包含的是一七八四至一八六四年间美国侵略中国的历史。
    在一八四四年继中英南京条约后订立的中美望厦条约，标志着美国资本主义对华侵略的正式开始，但是在这以前，美国的海盗式的商人对中国的掠夺活动已经有六十年的纪录。这就是本书第一编的主要内容。作者指出早期美国资本积累的血腥的本质。美国的南部及中部的农业资本集团以侵占印第安人土地、剥削黑人奴隶的劳动力、从事土地投机等血污手段起家。北部新英格兰的商业资本集团则依靠海盗式的劫掠和走私活动而发大财。他们很快地就把眼光注射到当时被视为人类黄金宝库所在地的中国。
    一七八四年第一只抵达广州的美国商船，就是新英格兰和纽约的特产——走私船。跟着来到中国寻找所谓“巨大机会”的人们就络绎不绝了。一只船到广州一趟，就要赚百分之四五百的高利。他们拿毒品（鸦片）和人参、皮货等，换取我们的丝、茶；他们凭借欺骗、劫掠和武装走私，剥削中国人民，把中国人民的财富积累为“许许多多的新英格兰资本”。他们自己并不讳言：“不畏远道艰险，来华贸易的冒险精神，是从海盗的经验得来的。”
    作者指出：美国海盗式资产阶级代言人力图使人们相信，美国没有对中国进行卑鄙的贩毒贸易——鸦片的输入与走私，然而历史说明了美国商人在这方面是完全和英国商人一样的。作者提出的史料，证实早在二十世纪开始，就已有以专向中国贩毒品为业的美国商行，而且几乎“每个波士顿或沙伦的商人，都是如此”。美国商人有专做鸦片贸易、包揽武装走私的飞剪式船只。这些船只“武装齐全”，往往“星夜遄行”，施放枪炮，抗拒中国的关津。一个美国人摩里逊这样写着：“就是基督教的传教师都不反对此项贸易。……他们都说，鸦片无害于中国人，像酒的无害于美国人一样。”这实在是无耻达到透顶。
    作者正确地总结了这一阶段的中美关系史，说明：美国早期的资本积累，是这样用“血与火的语言”，写在中国人民的历史上的。
    这本书的第二编讨论了美国资产阶级在进入工业资本主义的阶段后，如何开始发展对我国的侵略。讨论的重心是美国在鸦片战争中的政策和一八四四年的中美望厦条约。
    作者分析自一八三○年以后，美国纺织品开始侵入我国市场；到了一八四○年后，美国资本主义侵华的内容起了变化——它已不是前此半世纪间的单纯商业资本的剥削，而是进入工业资本为占有、开辟殖民地市场而进行侵略的阶段了。在鸦片战争中，美国资产阶级充当了有力的帮凶。美国资产阶级热烈地欢迎这个强盗战争，它的奴仆——传教士之一的雷维斯不知耻地说过：“这个战争已经在上帝的默佑下，被用来开辟我们对这广大帝国关系的新纪元了。”
    这“新纪元”就是以企图沦中国为美国的半殖民地的中美望厦条约而开始的。美国政府的文件公然表示：这个条约“已将美国对华关系，放置在一个崭新的立脚点上，万分有利于美国商务以及其他利益之发展。”这所谓“崭新的立脚点”，就是标志这一时期国际资本主义联合侵华政策的所谓“利益均沾”主义。
    由于美国当时在太平洋上还没有比较雄厚的力量，所以它特别要运用利益均沾主义这一武器来在共同掠夺中国的强盗联合阵线中获取利益。本书作者说：
        “就美国来说，自鸦片战争开始，它一贯地采
    取这样的联合侵略政策。不论它直接地或间接地
    参加战争，或狡黠地躲避战争的形式，它是一切
    对华作战国家之事实上的盟友。因为，一切侵华
    战争的胜利，都等于美国的胜利一样。反过来
    说，在这一资本主义国际侵华发展过程中，不论
    美国扮演那一种角色，它的扮演，同样地获得其
    他侵略者的支持，因为，它的任何胜利，也即等
    于其他侵略国家的胜利一样。”（本书第七八—七
    九页）
    就是这种“利益均沾”而且相互循环增益的“主义”，使得美国获得了巨大的利益。
    自中美望厦条约以后，美国资产阶级不仅以征服者的姿态进入中国，而且以奴隶主的凶残来贩卖、拐骗我国劳动人民到西方去做苦工——这就是在十九世纪四十年代末期开始的、继鸦片贸易而成为中国人民惨史之一页的“苦力贸易”。在这项“贸易”中，美国海盗式资产阶级所得的野蛮的血污利润，可以高达十余倍的骇人数字。这在美国国会的档案中，保留着不能掩饰的纪录。
    “扩大侵略与干涉太平天国革命”是本书的第三编。在这一编中说到太平天国革命运动和第二次鸦片战争。不论在前者或是后者，我们都可以看到美国资产阶级的罪恶的血手。如作者所征引的事实所指出：美国在这一时期只有一个目的，就是把中国变成“美国企业的一个广大领域，美国商业的一个无涯市场”（一八五三年的美国驻华专使马歇尔语）。因为这个市场，“其价值大于美国现时所能进入的全世界一切市场之总和”（一八五四年的专使麦克莲语）。为了达成这个目的，美国的另一个驻华专使传教士巴驾曾经建议“三国对华商务，无限制的向中华帝国全境发展”，甚至赤裸裸地主张美英法国际资本主义强盗联合武力侵华。这时美国和英国法国一起，利用了太平天国革命形势，起先是用武力威胁摇摇欲坠的满清统治者以获得更大的侵略利益，然后是协助满清政府武装干涉中国革命。本书叙述了第二次鸦片战争前美国统治者对华的军事挑衅与军事威胁政策，也指明了美国在第二次鸦片战争中一面协助英法强盗的侵略进军，一面用调停人姿态进行拉拢，从中渔利的两面派阴谋。本书也用生动的事实纪录了在一八六○年组成的以美国流氓华尔为中心的国际劫掠队的罪行。美国人摩尔斯的著作承认：这些帮助满清政府进攻太平天国的外国人都是“为着劫掠的展望的引诱而来”的。
    美帝国主义的辩护士常企图使人相信，在两次鸦片战争中，美国的手都是干净的。本书用充分的事实驳斥了这种谎话。在第二次鸦片战争中，正如在第一次鸦片战争中一样，美国所以没有公开出面，不过是因为它当时的力量还不够在远东的强盗帮的活动中做首脑。从而他就只能用各种趁火打劫，乘势讹诈的狡诈手段来攫夺各种权益。有些研究中美关系史的著作为说明美国早年也已经参与对中国的侵略，而把美国描写为在当时已是侵略中的主角，那是不合事实的。这样说了，就不能正确地说明后来美国在太平洋上建立了侵略据点后怎样一步步求取对中国的霸权。卿汝楫的这本书的个别地方虽然也有不适当地把当时的美国写成对华侵略的主角的缺点，但是本书用了许多生动的材料，使人看到美国当年在列强对中国的联合侵略行动中，的确是担任着一个极端卑鄙可耻的角色，其狡诈与凶残也决不逊于别的老牌海盗国家。在这点上，本书是很成功的。
    本书作者大量利用了美国政府有关中美关系的档案文件、美国侵华人物的言论以及满清政府的外交文件，加以初步的整理和分析，具体地揭露了美帝国主义的狰狞面目，作出了若干令人信服的总结。这些说明应该能够激起每个读者对于美国侵略者的无比仇恨和高度的警惕。我们希望作者能以写作第一卷同样的严肃态度来从事以后各卷的写作。
