    Fuxin City Ping'an Mining Bureau Security Section
    Determined to Thoroughly Examine Bureaucratic Work Style
    Comrade Editor: After studying the materials about the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," the comrades of the Security Section of the Ping'an Mining Bureau in Fuxin City, Liaoxi Province, immediately examined our work. In the past, we also adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards reports and accusations from the people. For example, the matter of worker Yu Enqing reporting the counter-revolutionary element Hu Changshun to the Security Section has never been dealt with. Furthermore, during the Spring Festival last year, burglaries occurred continuously in workers' residences, and the public security police station did not take action. When workers reported to the Security Section, we also did not take action, which directly affected work and was resolved by other units after a long delay. Upon examination, the bureaucratic work style of our department is no less severe than the bureaucratic work styles of the twenty-seven organizations in the "Zhang Shunyou Incident." We are determined to learn from the lessons of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" and thoroughly settle accounts with our bureaucracy.

    阜新市平安矿务处保卫科
    决彻底检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：辽西省阜新市平安矿务处保卫科的同志们学习了关于“张顺有事件”的材料，立即检查了我们的工作。过去，我们对待人民群众的检举和控诉等事件，也是采取官僚主义态度的。如工人于恩庆来保卫科检举反革命分子胡长顺的事情，我们一直没有处理。又如去年春节时，工人住地连续失盗，公安派出所不管，工人来保卫科报告，我们也不管，直接影响到工作，拖了许久才由别的单位解决了。检查起来，我们这个部门的官僚主义作风，并不比“张顺有事件”中二十七个机关的官僚主义作风轻。我们决心接受“张顺有事件”的教训，彻底清算我们的官僚主义。
