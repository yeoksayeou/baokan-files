Falsifying Achievements, Concealing Accidents, Fraudulently Obtaining the Title of Meritorious Worker
Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu Expelled from the Party
Xi Neng'an (Communist Party member), the chief of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau, and Li Yonglu (Communist Party member), the vice chairman of the Beijing Sub-district Committee of the Railway Trade Union, jointly falsified achievements, concealed accidents, deceived the organization, and fraudulently obtained the titles of "Model Locomotive" and "Special Class Meritorious Worker," causing extremely serious losses to the Party and the country. In order to uphold Party discipline, the Beijing Railway Sub-committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to expel Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu from the Party. This decision has been approved by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1949, when the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, led by Li Yongsuo, the national railway locomotive banner, came to Guannei to promote the experience of the crew responsibility system, Xi Neng'an, with a despicable attitude, took advantage of the upper-level call to "implement the crew responsibility system" and designated the 1939 locomotive crew, headed by Li Yonglu, as a typical example. Under the protection of Xi Neng'an, this locomotive crew falsely reported achievements, concealed accidents, and fraudulently obtained the title of meritorious worker for three years. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot's Party organization led the workers to expose this fraud, proving that all the main conditions for Li Yonglu to become a labor model were fabricated. First, the so-called record of the 1939 locomotive "safely traveling 100,000 kilometers" and "more than 190,000 safe kilometers" simply did not exist. According to the revealed materials, from August 1949 to September 1951, the 1939 locomotive had as many as sixteen responsibility accidents. The so-called "100,000 safe kilometers" of operation actually had less than 10,000 kilometers that were safe. Second, the record of "extending two and a half Class A inspection periods" was also fabricated. In February 1950, after the 1939 locomotive traveled 43,000 kilometers, under the command of Depot Chief Xi Neng'an, a "big black job" was done on the vehicle, secretly carrying out a Class A overhaul for three days and two nights, but falsely reporting "no-fire preparation." During this "big black job," Xi Neng'an and others secretly replaced a large amount of materials, with the smoke pipes alone worth more than 80 million yuan. In addition, Xi Neng'an and others also carried out many "small black jobs" such as secretly replacing main axle tiles, etc., which were not accounted for. Calculated, the material costs spent on the 1939 locomotive exceeded the cost of five Class A inspections. Most of these expenses were shared by Xi Neng'an and others among other locomotives. Third, the new record of "saving 25% of fuel" boasted by Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu was also completely inconsistent with the facts. In fact, they used despicable means such as bribery and private lobbying, and through the relationship of corrupt elements in the oil depot, obtained 1,744 kilograms of grease more from the state. They counted this act of theft as "saving fuel costs" as an "achievement."

Xi Neng'an's performance in daily work was also very bad. He was dictatorial and consistently ignored democratic management, even proposing to abolish the democratic management committee; as a result, the political enthusiasm of the workers could not be fully developed, and various advanced experiences could not be well promoted. Since 1950, the work of the entire depot has gradually declined, and for several months the production targets were not met.

Xi Neng'an also had serious errors in the matter of cadres. Many of the people he promoted and recommended were his cronies, some of whom even had political problems. They formed small cliques, eating, drinking, and playing, and some people took the opportunity to steal locomotive coal and materials, causing great losses to the state.

Xi Neng'an not only seriously neglected Party work, and did not participate in Party life for a long time, but his behavior of disregarding organization and discipline had already developed to the serious extent of openly opposing the Party organization. In 1950, the Fengtai District Party Committee's decisions on strengthening the work of the workers' militia and strengthening the political education of employees were resisted by Xi Neng'an. He insisted that "the militia is useless"; and threatened the Party branch secretary, saying, "If you insist on letting me establish a militia, then I, the depot chief, will not be responsible if the production task is not completed in the future." And after the militia was established, he even dared to disband the militia once.

After the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, the Party organization led the workers to expose the ugly behavior of Xi Neng'an, Li Yonglu and others. Xi Neng'an not only did not humbly accept criticism and correct his mistakes, but instead adopted an attitude of retaliation against the workers. Because the worker Xu Baoqing exposed Xi Neng'an's errors of shielding his cronies and concealing accidents, Xi Neng'an lost his temper with Xu Baoqing, and even used such vicious words to satirize Xu Baoqing:

"Do you want to show that you know a lot? Is this being proactive? I think you are harming others to benefit yourself! What good is this to you? You say I concealed accidents? That's because the workers' consciousness is not high." And threatened Xu Baoqing:

"What if this matter is published in the newspaper? If something goes wrong, you will be fully responsible!" Then, Xi Neng'an took advantage of the opportunity of the higher authorities to transfer locomotives and personnel to advocate immediately transferring Xu Baoqing away. When the Party branch committee members raised objections, he also said: "Doesn't the administration have this little power?" In fact, Xi Neng'an used this kind of "power" too often. He often suppressed and squeezed out people who offered opinions, and many employees were transferred away because they were dissatisfied with his leadership. Employees reflected: "Whoever dares to criticize the depot chief will have a stamp stuck on their forehead and be sent to Zhengzhou." (Once, the higher authorities wanted to transfer a batch of cadres from the Fengtai Locomotive Depot to work in Zhengzhou. Xi Neng'an took the opportunity to transfer away those who had opinions about him.) This time, thanks to the correct leadership of the work team dispatched by the Tianjin Railway Administration Party Committee and the support of the workers' struggle, Xi Neng'an's vicious methods could no longer be implemented, and the inside story of him and Li Yonglu fraudulently obtaining the title of model was finally exposed.

However, as in the past, Xi Neng'an was still unwilling to strictly examine his mistakes. He admitted his mistakes in words, but his thoughts and actions were completely opposed to the Party. Even when the Party Committee was about to give him disciplinary action, he secretly convened his cronies and people with political problems to discuss how to deal with the Party.

Because Xi Neng'an's bad behavior not only seriously hindered the democratic reform of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, but also caused irreparable losses to the Party's work in building the Fengtai Locomotive Depot and cultivating labor models; Li Yonglu's bad behavior of falsifying achievements and fraudulently obtaining the title of meritorious worker had already left a very bad influence among the masses, they had long lost the conditions of Communist Party members, and the Beijing Railway Sub-committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the opinions of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot Party branch committee, and after requesting instructions from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, decided to expel Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu from the Party; and suggested that the administration and trade union remove Xi Neng'an's position as depot chief and Li Yonglu's position as vice chairman of the Beijing Sub-district Committee of the Railway Trade Union, and revoke Xi Neng'an's title of "First-Class Meritorious Worker" and Li Yonglu's title of "Special-Class Meritorious Worker."

The reason why Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu committed such serious mistakes was, of course, because of their bad character; however, the Beijing Railway Sub-committee of the Chinese Communist Party also bears some responsibility for not discovering such serious events for a long time, causing Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu's mistakes to develop. The Fengtai District Party Committee had launched a struggle against Xi Neng'an's bad behavior, and had constantly reported Xi Neng'an's situation to the Beijing Railway Sub-committee; but because the Sub-committee always believed that Xi Neng'an was an old cadre with certain achievements in his work, it adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the reports from below, not paying attention to or even disbelieving these reports. As for Li Yonglu, from the Fengtai District Party Committee to the Party Group of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, it had never been discovered that he was a fake model. Since 1951, although the Tianjin Railway Bureau Party Committee and the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee had also conducted some criticism and education on some of Xi Neng'an's mistakes, they often did not truly discover the seriousness of his mistakes and did not fundamentally correct Xi Neng'an's mistakes because the Branch Party Committee lightly believed in Xi Neng'an's two-faced self-criticism. Later, although they realized the seriousness of the problem, they did not fully fulfill the responsibilities that the Party Committee should have fulfilled and deal with it promptly, resulting in great losses to the Party's work. In addition, the reason why Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu's mistakes were not corrected for a long time was also inseparable from the fact that the administrative and trade union leaders at the higher levels did not conduct strict education on them. Some leading cadres of the Beijing Railway Branch Bureau, the Tianjin Railway Administration, and the Ministry of Railways Locomotive Bureau either tolerated and accommodated Xi Neng'an's mistakes and only praised him; or adopted a bureaucratic attitude; or adopted a liberal attitude, like the Locomotive Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration, which even adopted a protective attitude towards the fake model of the 1939 locomotive crew under the guidance of the erroneous idea of "taking care of typical examples." Originally, when the 1939 locomotive crew applied for the model locomotive team in September 1950, the average score of the whole team was only 40 points, which was not up to standard; and the Locomotive Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration even specially approved the 1939 locomotive as a "backbone member of the model locomotive team." This created a loophole for Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu to exploit, and therefore increased the concerns of some Party members and employees, who did not dare to boldly criticize and expose. Therefore, although the above-mentioned leading organs had frequently sent work teams to work in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot from 1949 to the first half of 1951, they had never discovered Li Yonglu's serious mistakes, and they did not fully understand Xi Neng'an's mistakes either. In order to remember this painful lesson and improve the style of leadership, the Tianjin Railway Party Committee and the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have reviewed their serious bureaucratic errors and dereliction of duty in the railway industry. The Tianjin Railway Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also made a decision on July 1, requiring Party organizations throughout the railway to organize study and discussion of the Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu incident, strictly conduct ideological examination, expose and correct the erroneous ideas of being fond of boasting and being arrogant and complacent, in order to ensure the victorious completion of the 1952 production tasks.

    伪造成绩，隐瞒事故，骗取功臣称号
    奚能安、李永禄被清除出党
    北京铁路分局丰台机务段段长奚能安（共产党员）和铁路工会北京分区委员会副主席李永禄（共产党员）共同伪造成绩，隐瞒事故，蒙蔽组织，骗取“模范机车”和“特等功臣”的称号，给党和国家造成了极其严重的损失。中共北京铁路分党委为严肃党纪，决定开除奚能安和李永禄出党。这一决定业经中共北京市委批准。
    一九四九年，全国铁路机车旗帜李永所领导的“毛泽东号”机车乘务组来关内推广乘务负责制经验时，奚能安即以卑鄙的态度，钻了上级号召“执行乘务员负责制”的空子，指定以李永禄为首的一九三九号机车包乘组为典型。这个机车包乘组在奚能安的包庇下，三年来假报成绩，隐瞒事故，骗取了功臣的称号。在“三反”运动中，丰台机务段党的组织领导工人群众揭穿了这个骗局，证明李永禄所以成为劳动模范的几个主要条件全部是捏造的。第一，所谓一九三九号机车“安全走行十万公里”及“十九万多安全公里”的纪录，根本没有这回事。据已揭发的材料，从一九四九年八月至一九五一年九月两年中，一九三九号机车共发生责任事故十六次之多。所谓行车“十万安全公里”，其实没有一万公里是安全的。第二，“延长两个半甲检期”的纪录也是捏造的。一九五○年二月，一九三九号机车行走了四万三千公里，就在段长奚能安的指挥下，为该车作了一次“大黑活”，暗地里干了三天两夜甲检修，却假报“无火预备”。在这次“大黑活”里，奚能安等人偷换大批材料，只烟管一项即值八千多万元。另外，奚能安等人还干了好多起偷换大轴瓦等等的“小黑活”，也都没有报账。计算起来，一九三九号机车所化费的材料费，超过了五个甲检的费用。这些费用的绝大部分，都由奚能安等分摊在其他机车身上了。第三，奚能安和李永禄等所吹嘘的“省油百分之二十五”的新纪录也和事实完全不符。事实上是他们用行贿、私人拉拢等卑鄙手段，通过油库贪污分子的关系，多领了国家一千七百四十四公斤油脂。他们把这种盗窃行为，算做了“节省油费”的“成绩”。
    奚能安在日常工作中的表现也是十分恶劣的。他独断专行，一贯忽视民主管理，甚至曾经提出要取消民主管理委员会；以致工人群众的政治热情得不到充分发扬，各种先进经验也不能很好地推广。自一九五○年以后，全段工作日渐下降，曾有好几个月完不成生产指标。
    在干部问题上，奚能安也有严重错误。他提拔和推荐的人有不少是他的亲信，其中有些甚至是有政治问题的。他们结成小集团，吃吃喝喝，吹吹打打，有些人就趁机盗窃机煤、材料，给国家造成了很大的损失。
    奚能安不仅严重地忽视党的工作，长期不过党的生活，而且目无组织、目无纪律的行为，早已发展到公开对抗党组织的严重程度。一九五○年，丰台地区党委关于加强工人纠察队的工作、加强职工政治教育的决定，都遭到了奚能安的抵抗。他硬说“纠察队没有作用”；并威胁总支书记说：“如果一定让我建立纠察队，那末，将来完不成生产任务，我段长不负责任。”而在纠察队成立后，他竟敢一度解散纠察队。
    “三反”运动开始后，党的组织领导工人群众揭发了奚能安、李永禄等人的丑恶行为。奚能安不但不虚心地接受批评，改正错误，反而对工人群众采取了打击报复的态度。因为工人徐宝清揭露了奚能安包庇亲信、隐瞒事故的错误，奚能安就对徐宝清大发脾气，甚至用这样恶毒的话来讽刺徐宝清：
    “你要表现你知道的事情多吗？这是积极吗？我看你是损人利己！这对你有什么好处？你说隐瞒事故吗？那是因为工人觉悟不高。”并且威胁徐宝清：
    “这件事情要是登在报上怎么办？出了事你负完全责任！”接着，奚能安就趁上级调机调员的机会，主张立即把徐宝清调走。党的总支委员们提出反对意见时，他还说：“行政上连这点权力也没有吗？”事实上，奚能安使用这种“权力”的时候太多了。他经常打击和排挤提意见的人，有不少的职工，因为不满意他的领导而被调走。职工反映：“谁敢批评段长，谁就会脑门上贴邮票发郑州。”（有一次，上级要从丰台机务段调一批干部到郑州工作。奚能安即乘机把对他有意见的人调走。）这一次，由于天津铁路管理局党委派遣的工作组正确地领导党的基层组织，支持了工人群众的斗争，奚能安的恶毒手段再也没法施展，而他和李永禄骗取模范称号的黑幕也终于被揭穿了。
    但是，如同过去一样，奚能安对于自己的错误，仍然不肯严格进行检讨，他口头上承认错误，思想上和行动上却完全和党对立。直到党委要给以纪律处分时，他还召集他的亲信和有政治问题的人，秘密会商如何对付党。
    由于奚能安的恶劣行为不仅严重地阻碍了丰台机务段的民主改革，而且使党在建设丰台机务段和培养劳动模范的工作上遭受了难以补偿的损失；李永禄伪造成绩、骗取功臣称号的恶劣行为，早在群众中留下了极坏的影响，他们早已丧失了共产党员条件，中共北京铁路分党委根据丰台机务段党的总支委员会的意见，经请示中共北京市委批准，决定开除奚能安、李永禄的党籍；并建议行政和工会撤掉奚能安的段长、李永禄的铁路工会北京分区委员会副主席的职务，取消奚能安“一等功臣”和李永禄“特等功臣”的称号。
    奚能安、李永禄所以犯了如此严重的错误，当然是因为他们的品质恶劣；但是，中共北京铁路分党委对于这样严重的事件长期没有发觉，致使奚能安和李永禄的错误得到发展，也负有一定的责任。丰台地区的党委对奚能安的恶劣行为曾经展开过斗争，并曾不断地向北京铁路分党委反映奚能安的情况；但由于分党委总认为奚能安是个老干部，在工作中有一定成绩，因而对于下面的反映采取了官僚主义的态度，不重视甚至不相信这些反映。至于对李永禄，则从丰台地区党委到中央人民政府铁道部党组，一直没有发觉他是假模范。自一九五一年以来，天津铁路局党委和北京铁路分局分党委对于奚能安的某些错误，虽然也曾进行过一些批评和教育，但常常因为分党委轻信了奚能安的用两面派手法所作的检讨，没有真正发现其错误的严重性，也没有从根本上纠正奚能安的错误。后来，虽然认识了问题的严重性，但又没有完全尽到党委应尽的责任，迅予处理，以致使党的工作受到很大的损失。另外，奚能安和李永禄的错误所以长期得不到纠正，和上级的行政、工会领导方面没有对他们进行严格的教育也是分不开的。北京铁路分局、天津铁路管理局、铁道部机务局的某些领导干部，有的对奚能安的错误姑息迁就，一味表扬；有的采取官僚主义的态度；有的采取自由主义的态度，像天津铁路管理局机务处，甚至在“照顾典型”的错误思想指导下，对一九三九号机车包乘组这个假模范采取了包庇的态度。本来，一九五○年九月一九三九号机车包乘组投考模范机车队时，全组平均分数只四十分，并不及格；而天津铁路管理局机务处竟然也特准一九三九号机车为“模范机车队基干队员”。这就给奚能安和李永禄造成了可钻的空子，并因此增加了某些党员和职工们的顾虑，不敢大胆地进行批评、揭露。因之，上述领导机关虽自一九四九年至一九五一年上半年经常派有工作组在丰台机务段工作，但始终没有发现李永禄的严重错误，而对奚能安的错误也不完全了解。为了记取这一沉痛教训，改善领导作风，中共天津铁路党委会及北京铁路分党委会已对自己的严重的官僚主义和对铁路事业失职的错误作了检讨。中共天津铁路党委会并于七月一日作出决定，要求全路党组织对奚能安、李永禄事件组织学习讨论，严格地进行思想检查，揭发和纠正好大喜功、骄傲自满等错误思想，以保证一九五二年生产任务的胜利完成。
