Friends and comrades who are fighting for the cause of peace, at this moment of parting, if we didn't know that we were going back armed with everything we have heard and seen in your great country, to fight alongside our British comrades for the cause of peace in the West, we would certainly be very sad.

Thanks to your exceptionally kind and thoughtful care, which made our journey very comfortable, and thanks to the dear comrades you sent to receive us, who were constantly concerned about us, we were able to complete our travel plans from Guangzhou to Shenyang, from Hangzhou and Shanghai to Hankou and Shashi.

This was a very educational and enjoyable trip. We personally understood the significance of China's liberation, its liberation from Japanese aggression and imperialist colonial rule.

We personally saw the lives of peasants and their liberated wives and daughters freed from feudal enslavement. This liberation and freedom has enriched family life and greatly increased land productivity.

We have seen a fact that has great significance for Britain: for the first time in history, there are three hundred million peasants who have money to spend and are very eager to buy all kinds of agricultural tools, large and small, that our technicians can manufacture, and to exchange them for tung oil, which our chemists urgently need to make fertilizers.

How concerned and diligent your government is in helping the peasants turn your centuries-old disasters into loyal servants that benefit mankind. You have tamed your mighty rivers, preventing them from flooding during the flood season, and also using them to irrigate your land during droughts.

I am very familiar with the great projects in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but in terms of the difficulties you have overcome, I have never seen a project that can match yours in speed and scale: you safely channel the turbulent waters of the Yangtze River during the flood season into a huge reservoir with a 1,000-meter-long sluice gate until the danger period has passed.

Thanks to your special care in providing a special plane, we were able to arrive there to visit on the eve of the completion of this project. When we were with the workers, we could see how diligently and skillfully these many people worked, how full of ardent enthusiasm they were, and how deeply grateful they were to the great father of their motherland, Chairman Mao, and his comrades, and how deeply grateful they were to him for saving them from the imminent danger in time.

This great project took only three months from start to finish, and one whole month was in torrential rain. As an engineer, I looked at the towering gates stretching for a thousand meters in front of this project, and the deep emotion I felt was something I had never experienced before.

I had the same feeling on another great project, which will forever eliminate the terrible scenes of floods and famines that I personally witnessed in the Huai River Basin in 1932, and make it forever the granary of China, a place of happiness and prosperity for every household.

All of this was created by the people; working for the people, and the people working for you, creating these great achievements.

Secondly, as someone who grew up among the factories that are everywhere in Lancashire, I was very interested to see the ramie factory in Hangzhou.

The efficiency of this factory is very impressive. This Chinese factory has great improvements over this type of factory in England. Its machines are built low, and the workers don't feel like horses with blinders on, submerged in piles of machines; the factory is psychologically designed so perfectly that everything is in harmony with the surrounding environment: gardens, dormitories and nurseries, making it the most beautiful factory I have ever seen.

I am very happy to hear that China can be completely independent in other industries if necessary. This is the case with ramie. China produces its own ramie raw materials, and at the same time produces food through more scientific farming methods, so that food production is not affected in any way.

I am saddened by the trade losses caused by forcing China to manufacture independently in this way. However, I am very pleased to hear that China does not want this and is willing to engage in mutually beneficial trade with us.

I am very pleased to see China's new cleanliness and hygiene, and the fight against flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs and rats. Everywhere we can see these slogans, large and small.

Guangzhou has solved the problems of drinking water and toilets for 250,000 citizens, who previously had almost no access to these things.

Tianjin has built 200 kilometers of sewers.

Changsha transported 12,000 tons of garbage that had accumulated for centuries through voluntary labor, and opened up a new avenue with complete modern drainage equipment from the station to the river through this dirty area of the city.

Liberated China had already begun these large-scale sanitation projects before the heinous germ warfare attacks began.

They are dealing with germ warfare with skilled scientific technology and indomitable courage. Germ warfare has further promoted this wave of sanitary reform, making China the most health-conscious country in the world, a pioneer on the road to active health care.

I finally mentioned germ warfare. I am ashamed to hear of this appalling inhuman act; especially shameful is that this inhuman act was committed by a country that shamelessly claims to be "Christian."

In China, no one has any doubt about the truth of this act. Anyone who, like me, has been to the affected areas and talked to eyewitnesses has no doubt about the facts.

But in Britain, some people don't believe it. I was told that it was impossible for Americans to degenerate to this point. "It's communist propaganda."

Now, it is on this issue that I am bringing back from China the most powerful weapon for my struggle for peace.

In every city I visited, I consciously contacted the leaders of Christian churches, the ministers appointed by Canterbury, the Methodist Church, and the Baptist Church, the Catholic priests and believers, and many others.

I talked to them, asked them questions, and they all told me four things in unison: (1) Religion is free in China; (2) They warmly welcome China's new life; (3) They oppose foreign control of China and Chinese Christianity; (4) They firmly believe that germ warfare is a fact, and they want to unite with the entire Chinese people to oppose it. Christian doctors, nurses, and general believers are participating in this struggle in China and Korea.

I am bringing back a series of documents signed by the leaders of various Christian churches in China protesting against germ warfare and calling on British Christians to condemn it in unison, and I am preparing to hand them over to my own and other Christian churches.

Christians, who still make up a large part of our people, can no longer treat the news of germ warfare as propaganda and disbelieve it. This is indeed a challenge that they must face squarely, otherwise they will build a staggering divide between Christians in the East and West.

I am returning to Britain with confidence and hope, thanking you for giving me such a valuable weapon of peace.

Time does not allow me to say more. What I want to say cannot be said in a short time.

But I must add a few more words in conclusion.

I admire your great construction.

I admire your water conservancy projects and protective forest belts.

I admire your clean cities, your new industries and new agriculture. But, in addition to all this, what I admire most is the great transformation of the moral standards of all your people.

This transformation of moral standards puts people first, and self second.

This transformation of moral standards, which can only be achieved after many arduous struggles, is not unlike the feeling of a true Christian when he dedicates himself after being moved by the Holy Spirit. What could be more sublime than dedicating ourselves to the human beings around us?

This is the true root of all the great things I have seen in China.

Your great leader Chairman Mao and other loyal leaders, your heroic People's Liberation Army, all of you, people from all walks of life, embody the great spirit of I for everyone and everyone for me.

This is the spirit that this era craves.

It is this spirit that leads to peace.

It is also this spirit that fully guarantees rapid and complete achievement.

    在我国人民保卫世界和平委员会的送行酒会上
    英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊的讲话全文
    为和平事业奋斗的朋友们和同志们，在这临别的时候，要不是我们知道我们此去已以在你们伟大的国家里耳闻目睹的一切加倍武装了我们自己，以便和我们的英国同志一道在西方为保卫和平事业而战斗，那末我们心里一定非常难过。
    由于你们对我们照顾得异常亲切和周到，使我们的旅程非常舒适，由于你们派来接待我们的那些亲爱的同志无时无刻不在关心我们，我们才能完成从广州到沈阳、从杭州和上海到汉口和沙市的旅行计划。
    这是一次非常有教育意义而愉快的旅行。我们亲身领会了中国解放的意义，它从日本侵略和帝国主义殖民统治下得到解放的意义。
    我们亲身看到从封建奴役下得到解放的农民和他们的获得自由的妻女的生活，这种解放和自由已使家庭生活富裕起来，并使土地生产力大大增加。
    我们看到一个事实，这个事实对英国有着重大意义：在历史上第一次出现了这样的三亿农民，他们有钱可花，而且非常想买我们的技工可以制造的大大小小的农具，并且以我们迫切需要的桐油来交换我们的化学家可以制造的肥料。
    你们的政府是多么关心和努力帮助农民把你们的世世代代的灾害变成造福人类的忠仆。你们制伏了你们的巨大的河流，不让它们在洪汛期间泛滥，而且还要它们在天旱时灌溉你们的土地。
    我很熟悉苏联和东欧的伟大工程，但是就你们所克服的困难而言，我从来没有见过一个工程在速度和规模方面能够赶得上你们的工程：你们用一千公尺长的水闸把洪汛期间的长江的奔腾澎湃的江水安全地引到一个巨大的蓄水库中，直到险期过去时为止。
    由于你们特别照顾，供给一架专机，我们能够在这个工程完工的前夕到达那里参观，当我们和工人们处在一起的时候，我们可以看得到这许多人是怎样勤劳而纯熟地工作，他们怎样满怀着火热的热情，他们是多么深深地感激他们祖国伟大的父亲毛主席和他的同志，多么深深地感激他及时地挽救他们脱出了迫在眼前的危险。
    这个伟大的工程从开工到完成前后只历时三个月，而其中整整一个月是下着倾盆大雨的天气，我以一个工程学家的眼光，在这工程跟前举目远望这延绵一千公尺一个接着一个的高大闸门，心里感到的深深激动是我从来不曾经历过的。
    在另一个伟大的工程上，我也有同样的感觉，这个工程将使淮河流域永远不再有我在一九三二年亲眼看到的那种水灾和饥荒的可怕景象，并使它永远成为中国的谷仓，成为家家户户幸福繁荣的地方。
    这一切都是人民创造出来的；为人民大众工作，人民大众也为你们工作，创造出这些伟大的成就。
    其次，我以一个在兰开夏到处林立的工厂当中长大的人的眼光，以极大的兴趣来看杭州的苎麻工厂。
    这个工厂的效率给人印象非常深刻，中国这个工厂比英国这种工厂有很大的改良，它的机器建筑得很低，工人们不会觉得像戴上障眼革的马那样湮没在一堆堆的机器里；这工厂在心理上设计得那样完满，一切都和周围的环境：花园、宿舍和托儿所等显得那样协调，使得它成为我所见过的最美丽的工厂。
    我很高兴地听说中国在其他工业方面如果必要的话，也可以完全独立。在苎麻方面就是这样。中国一方面生产它自己的苎麻原料，同时又借更科学的耕作方法生产粮食，不使粮食生产受到任何影响。
    由于这样强迫中国独立制造而造成的贸易损失使我感到痛心。但是，我听说中国并不希望这样，倒是愿意与我们进行互利的贸易，对于这，我又深感满意。
    我看到中国的新的清洁卫生情况以及扑灭苍蝇、蚊虫、臭虫和老鼠的斗争，深感满意。到处我们都可以看到这种大大小小的标语。
    广州为二十五万市民解决了吃水与厕所的问题，而先前他们是几乎完全享受不到这些东西的。
    天津修筑了二百公里的下水道。
    长沙以自愿劳动运走了堆积达数世纪之久的一万二千吨的垃圾，并且穿过该城的这个污秽区从车站到河边开辟了一条拥有完备的现代排水设备的新的大马路。
    解放了的中国在万恶的细菌战的袭击还没有开始以前就已经着手进行这些规模宏大的卫生工程了。
    他们以熟练的科学技术和不屈不挠的勇气来对付细菌战。细菌战进一步推动了这种卫生改革的浪潮，使中国成为世界上最注意保健的国家，成为积极保健的道路上的开拓者。
    我最后提到细菌战。我听说这种骇人听闻的不人道行为，深以为耻；尤其可耻的是这种不人道行为竟是一个厚颜无耻地自命“信奉基督教”的国家干出来的。
    在中国，没有一个人对于这种行为的真实性有任何怀疑。凡是像我那样到过受害地点，并且和目击者谈过话的人，没有一个对事实有任何怀疑。
    但是在英国，有人不相信。有人告诉我说，美国人堕落到这样地步是不可能的。“这是共产党的宣传。”
    现在，正是在这个问题上，我从中国带回我为和平事业斗争的最有力的武器。
    我在所到的每一个城市中，都有意识地与基督教教会的领袖，与坎特伯雷、卫理公会、浸礼会委派的牧师，与天主教的神甫与教徒以及其他许多人接触。
    我与他们谈话，向他们提出问题，他们异口同声地告诉我四件事情：（一）宗教在中国是自由的；（二）他们热诚地欢迎中国的新的生活；（三）他们反对外国控制中国和中国的基督教；（四）他们深信细菌战是事实，并且他们要与整个中国人民团结起来反对它。基督教医师、护士以及一般信徒都在中国和朝鲜参加了这个斗争。
    我带了中国各基督教教会领袖普遍签署的抗议细菌战并且号召英国基督教徒同声谴责的一系列文件回国，准备交给我自己的以及其他的基督教教会。
    在我国人民中间仍占很大部分的基督教徒不能再把细菌战消息当作是宣传而不相信了。这的确是他们必须正视的挑战，不然的话，他们将在东西方基督教徒之间筑起一道惊人的鸿沟来。
    我满怀着信心和希望回到英国去，感谢你们把这样宝贵的和平武器交给了我。
    时间不容许我再说什么了。我想说的话不是短时间所能说尽的。
    但是我一定要在结语中再添上几句话。
    我佩服你们的伟大建设。
    我佩服你们的水利工程和防护森林带。
    我佩服你们的清洁的城市、你们的新工业和新农业。但是，除了这一切以外，我最佩服的是你们全体人民道德标准的伟大转变。
    这种道德标准的转变使人先为人，后为己。
    这种需要许多艰苦斗争之后才能实现的道德标准的转变与一个真正的基督教徒在圣灵感动后献身的时候的感觉不无相似之处，还有什么能比献身给我们周围的人类还要崇高的事情呢？
    这就是我在中国见到的所有伟大事情的真正根源。
    你们的伟大领袖毛主席和其他忠诚的领袖，你们的英勇的人民解放军，你们所有地方，各界人士都体现了我为人人和人人为我的伟大精神。
    这时代所渴望的正是这种精神。
    导向和平的正是这种精神。
    迅速并完全获得成就的充分保证也是这种精神。
