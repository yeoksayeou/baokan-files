Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The first group of members of the Czechoslovak Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe, invited to China by the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, arrived in Beijing by plane on the 23rd, led by the troupe's leader, Veselý Jaroslav.

Li Zhaobing, Deputy Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Chen Qitong, Head of the General Political Department's Art Troupe, and over 50 military artists including Lan Ma, welcomed them at the airport. Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Kousal, Military Attaché Colonel Procházka, and embassy staff also welcomed them at the airport. Deputy Director Li Zhaobing delivered a welcoming speech at the airport, saying that the arrival of the art troupe will further consolidate the friendship between the people and armies of China and Czechoslovakia; and that every achievement and influence of this friendship will be conducive to the cause of defending people's democracy and world peace. Troupe leader Veselý Jaroslav replied that they were honored to be able to come to China to participate in the "August 1st" Army Day celebrations and would like to take this opportunity to pay high tribute to the heroic Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Czechoslovak Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe was founded in 1943 in the Eastern Front Corps during the Czechoslovak Patriotic War. Its organizer, Vit Nejedlý, was a young, talented composer who created many songs during the war years, one of which, "Forward to Prague," played a significant role in inspiring the fighting will of the entire army. Sadly, he heroically sacrificed himself in 1944 during the war on the Czechoslovak border. In addition to studying Czechoslovak folk art, the art troupe actively studies Soviet art and is now a model for artistic activities in various Czechoslovak military units. Besides participating in the "August 1st" Army Day celebrations, the art troupe will also hold artistic performances in Beijing and other major cities during this visit to China.

    捷军队文艺工作团第一批团员抵北京
    【新华社二十三日讯】应中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会邀请来我国的捷克斯洛伐克维特·聂德列欧军队文艺工作团的第一批团员，在二十三日由该团团长维赛利·雅罗斯拉夫率领，乘飞机抵北京。
    人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部副部长李兆炳，总政治部文工团团长陈其通和部队文艺工作者蓝马等五十多人到机场欢迎。捷克斯洛伐克驻我国大使康萨拉、武官普罗查上校和使馆人员也到机场欢迎。李兆炳副部长在机场致欢迎词。他说文工团的到来，将使中捷两国人民和军队之间的友谊获得更进一步的巩固；而这种友谊的每一种成就和影响，都会有利于保卫人民民主和世界和平的事业。文工团团长维赛利·雅罗斯拉夫答词说他们很以能来中国参加“八一”节为光荣，他们也要借此向英雄的中国人民和中国人民解放军致崇高的敬意。
    捷克斯洛伐克维特·聂德列欧军队文艺工作团成立于一九四三年捷克斯洛伐克卫国战争时期的东线军团中。它的组织者维特·聂德列欧是一个年轻的天才作曲家，他曾在战争的年代里创作了很多歌曲，其中之一名“向布拉格前进”，曾在鼓舞全军的战斗意志上起了很大的作用；可惜他已在一九四四年捷克斯洛伐克边境的战争中英勇牺牲了。该文工团除研究捷克斯洛伐克人民艺术作品外，还积极学习苏联艺术；它现在是捷克斯洛伐克各部队文艺活动的榜样。该文工团这次来我国除参加“八一”节外，还将在北京和各大城市举行文艺演出。
