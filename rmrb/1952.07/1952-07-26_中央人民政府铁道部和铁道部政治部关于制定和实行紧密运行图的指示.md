The Central People's Government Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, in order to make the railway train schedule – an important chart for organizing the rhythmic work of many key railway departments – more accurate, specific, and practical, issued "Instructions on Formulating and Implementing Tight Train Schedules" on July 25th. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

(I)

In the past two months, the rapidly developing full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement has sharply presented railway leadership at all levels with a serious task. This requires us to quickly and correctly carry out a series of technical management reforms, and the central link of the current technical management reform work is the rapid formulation and implementation of tight train schedules. The experience of the movement in the past two months has proven that, due to the systematic promotion of various advanced working methods, production and transportation efficiency has been greatly improved on the one hand, and various contradictions in railway work have been exposed on the other hand. For example, transportation capacity has increased, but the volume of freight transported is insufficient; vehicle loading capacity has increased, but loading tasks are in arrears; locomotives can arrive and depart ahead of schedule, but trains cannot be connected in time, resulting in locomotives waiting for trains, or trains waiting for locomotives; the number of super-axle tons has increased, and the dwell time of vehicles has been extended; advanced units complete their tasks ahead of schedule, while backward units cannot coordinate their progress; various production quotas have been generally increased, but wages, working hours, and labor organization have not been improved in time. Such contradictions indicate that many of our outdated management systems are no longer adapted to the rapidly developing productive forces, urging leaders at all levels to quickly reform them, use advanced experience to improve backward units, and achieve planned and rhythmic production. Otherwise, the uncoordinated phenomena that continue to develop in several links of the railway's huge engine will seriously damage the discipline of railway production and delay the continued development of the entire productive forces. The primary method to solve the above contradictions is to formulate and implement
a tightly organized and technically sound tight train schedule. The development of the movement in the past two months has made the train schedule promulgated this summer far behind the actual situation, requiring us to seize all the time to do a good job in the tight train schedule. Only by correctly solving this major problem can the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement develop steadily and rapidly, can advanced units drive backward units to achieve universal improvement, and can we overcome the imbalances and uncoordinated phenomena that arise on the road to progress.

(II)

The tight train schedule is a new train schedule that integrates the current various advanced technical operation indicators and further promotes various advanced working methods to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. The tight train schedule and the train schedule promulgated this summer have significant differences in content and effect. First, the tight train schedule is built on the basis of various advanced technical operation indicators, so it can effectively exert equipment capabilities and improve the technology of employees. Second, the difference between the tight train schedule and the past train schedules lies in the fact that the past train schedules were based on calculations to determine the number of trains and then prescribe locomotive routes accordingly [Note 1]. However, the tight train schedule is different. It first considers locomotive routes and then uses this to coordinate appropriate traffic flow [Note 2] to organize the planned operation of trains (of course, this does not mean simply taking care of locomotive routes and negating the basic principle of traffic flow as the main body). The implementation of the tight train schedule can not only accelerate the turnover of vehicles, but also accelerate the turnover of locomotives. Third, the tight train schedule is mainly formulated by the railway sub-bureaus in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Ministry of Railways and the instructions of the Railway Administration. Therefore, the formulation of the tight train schedule can and must widely absorb the opinions of advanced workers, carefully study and investigate all aspects of the situation, and naturally it is possible to make it more in line with the actual situation. This advanced train schedule was initially created by advanced drivers such as Wang Jikui, Zheng Xikun, Qiao Yuyan, Guo Shude, Hou Jingming, Yuan Ziwen, Yu Guoxiang, etc., and advanced dispatchers such as Wang Zhen, Sun Xiaoju, Zhang Diankui, etc., who learned advanced Soviet methods and created valuable experience from practice, and then Soviet experts summarized and improved it from a technical and theoretical perspective. Therefore, this creative, vibrant, and practical tight train schedule has become our most powerful weapon for improving transportation work.

(III)

The formulation of a tight train schedule is a complex technical organizational work and a process of sharp struggle between new and old ideas. It must appropriately occupy various data in railway transportation work and be done well after research analysis and scientific calculation. Therefore, it requires party and administrative leading cadres at all levels to grasp the following basic principles in the process of formulating the tight train schedule:

First, in ideological leadership, we must establish an overall concept and resolutely oppose various forms of departmentalism. Some people believe that increasing the daily kilometerage of locomotives makes it difficult to shorten the transfer and dwell time of vehicles; shortening the transfer and dwell time of vehicles makes it difficult to increase the daily kilometerage of locomotives; saving the number of locomotives used makes it difficult to save vehicles, and saving vehicles makes it difficult to save locomotives; they only see the "interests" of their own jurisdiction and fail to see the difficulties caused to neighboring areas; they only take care of the locomotive routes within their own jurisdiction and do not take care of the locomotive routes of neighboring jurisdictions; they only consider the convenience of train connections within their own jurisdiction and do not ask whether train connections in neighboring sections are difficult. It should be pointed out that such thoughts that disregard the overall situation are a lack of national concept. In formulating the tight train schedule, we must resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against this departmentalism and conservative backward thinking. We must adhere to the principle of transportation as the main body, integrate the acceleration of vehicle turnover and the acceleration of locomotive turnover, sectional trains must obey direct trains, and local interests must obey national interests.

Second, proceed from the analysis of actual conditions and grasp the laws of freight flow [Note 3] and traffic flow. The formulation of a tight train schedule must start from the analysis of actual conditions, determine train numbers, and fix the number of trains. However, due to insufficient freight sources, inaccurate planning, and frequent changes in freight flow and traffic flow, the entire transportation planning work is in a passive state if freight flow and traffic flow cannot be grasped. Indeed, there are objective difficulties in the current situation. However, some leading cadres and transportation management personnel exaggerate the objective difficulties, believing that it is "impossible to grasp the freight flow and traffic flow, and must obey the command of the freight flow and traffic flow," and therefore abandon the efforts to fix train numbers [Note 4] and fix locomotive routes, blindly emphasizing that it is necessary to "adapt to circumstances and give play to creativity," resulting in daily "running current points" [Note 5], arbitrarily changing points, unplanned shutdowns [Note 6], and resurrections [Note 7]. This laissez-faire and irresponsible serious violation of discipline is absolutely not allowed. The root cause of this phenomenon is the lack of inspection by the leadership, the lack of regular investigation, statistics, and research on freight sources and freight flow, and inaccurate forecasts; and the lack of close contact between superiors and subordinates and between internal and external parties.

Freight flow and traffic flow are determined according to the state's transportation plan for each period. But this does not mean that railway leading organs at all levels do not need to actively grasp their regularity. Especially in the current situation where national transportation cannot be fully and precisely planned, it is even more necessary for railway leading organs at all levels to actively grasp it, starting from the analysis of actual conditions, strengthening investigation, statistics, and research work. According to the transportation plan and past actual conditions, special attention should be paid to the following points: 1. Grasp the junction points [Note 8], understand which train numbers, train types, cargo categories, arrival and departure times are frequently received from neighboring bureaus, and fix the frequently operated train numbers as core trains. 2. Deeply understand the freight source and freight flow situation within your jurisdiction, the loading and unloading situation, and also fix the train numbers that are frequently guaranteed to operate within your jurisdiction as core trains. 3. After fixing the frequently operated train numbers received from neighboring bureaus as core trains within your section, you can appropriately fix locomotive routes. 4. When there are changes in transportation volume, you can use numbered train schedules [Note 9] according to the situation. If there are temporary new changes, you can adjust them with super-axle loading. It should be affirmed that as long as we proceed from reality, use our brains, strengthen investigation work, and improve forecasting work, we are fully capable of changing this passive situation and fully capable of actively grasping the regularity of traffic flow and freight flow.

Third, select the average advanced standard. The tight train schedule is a comprehensive process of technical operations of various business units. In the current situation, various technical indicators are uneven, and most areas have not undergone scientific investigation and calculation work. Therefore, we can only determine reasonable advanced indicators from the technical indicators that have already been achieved in practice, combined with calculation work and absorbing mass opinions, as the basis for our formulation of the tight train schedule this time. According to existing experience, selecting the average advanced standard is the most appropriate. This means that it is not based on the outstanding records created by individual advanced figures, but on the average standard achieved by the majority of advanced figures. Naturally, there is still a certain distance between this average advanced standard and what ordinary employees can achieve. But without this distance, the role of actively organizing mobilization and universal improvement would be lost. In determining various standards, special attention should be paid to the following items: 1. How to shorten the dwell time of locomotives at foreign stations and depots; 2. How to improve section running time and travel speed; 3. How to shorten the technical operation time of stations, trains, and locomotive depots. Of course, all these technical operation process compressions must be built on a scientific basis and within the possible range. Violation of safety conditions and excessive increase in the labor intensity of employees are absolutely not allowed.

Fourth, implement the mass line and widely adopt the opinions of advanced workers. To formulate an advanced and practical tight train schedule, we must not only rely on engineers, dispatchers, and traffic planning personnel, but also widely absorb the opinions of advanced workers. Because this is an extremely complex technical organization and traffic planning work, it must have rich materials and correct ideological guidance. The vast majority of employees, especially the outstanding figures among them, like fighters executing combat plans, have a very deep experience of each arrangement. Therefore, before formulating the tight train schedule, each sub-bureau should go deep into the front line, convene various forms of advanced worker representative meetings or forums, organize dispatchers to ride along [Note 10], solicit opinions from all aspects, then summarize them, and then conduct mapping work after calculation based on the transportation plan, equipment conditions, and employee technical level. After repeated revisions, it should be submitted to the higher level for approval. In this way, it will not delay time; on the contrary, it is an effective way to save time and improve efficiency.

Fifth, create 500-kilometer working conditions for all drivers using locomotives. Past experience has proven that in the early stage of the movement's development, it was an advanced method for the leadership to consciously operate a few or a small part of locomotives according to the tight train schedule. Because at that time, most drivers lacked good technology and experience. A part of the drivers first operate according to the 500-kilometer route, which can not only gain experience but also create conditions for universal development. However, the current situation is different. The majority of drivers in most areas have not only gained experience but also initially mastered the technology of rapid traction. If we now only create 500-kilometer working conditions for a small number of drivers, it will make non-500-kilometer drivers lose the possibility of actively striving for it. This will also limit the growth of 500-kilometer drivers and hinder the development of the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. Therefore, when formulating a tight locomotive turnover schedule, we should gradually create 500-kilometer conditions for all drivers. Although this requires a process, we should try to shorten this time as much as possible.

(IV)

Formulating the tight train schedule is only the beginning of the work. Conscientiously implementing and adhering to it will encounter more difficulties than the formulation process. Therefore, the following points are required:

First, mobilize the whole party and all cadres to carry out implementation in all aspects. The train schedule is the overall technical operation process and work plan of railway units, and every employee should fulfill their due responsibilities in their work for the implementation of the tight train schedule. Therefore, we must correct the view that the implementation of the train schedule is only a matter for a few dispatchers and transportation management personnel. All departments must formulate their own work plans and work resolutely and disciplined under the provisions of the train schedule.

Second, various business units must, at the same time as the promulgation and implementation of the tight train schedule, stipulate a series of technical organization measures, such as the universal promotion of Suddinikov's new dispatching method, balancing the traction tonnage of major trunk lines across the country, formulating new station technical operation processes, formulating specific methods to improve technical speed and travel speed, implementing cyclical operation systems and improving locomotive quality, improving signals and communication equipment, improving line quality, eliminating slow speeds, identifying bridges, rectifying loading and unloading organizations, shortening loading operation time, and eliminating hot axle and poor braking accidents.

Third, require political organs at all levels to strengthen the discipline education of employees so that every employee understands that "railway transportation should become an engine like a good clockwork mechanism with clear work and correct actions." This is the essence of our railway transportation discipline, and the uninterrupted work of the entire railway engine is inseparable from the organization and discipline of each employee. How the Political Department (the party's combat organ on the railway) and party organizations at all levels can ensure that all links of the railway can work accurately and coordinately should become a regular combat task. The entire railway has entered a new stage with production reform as the center. Party work, political work, trade union work, and Youth League work must take further improving transportation efficiency as the center of all work and improve their own work around this central work.

    中央人民政府铁道部和铁道部政治部关于制定和实行紧密运行图的指示
    中央人民政府铁道部与铁道部政治部为使组织铁路许多主要部门有节奏地进行工作的重要图表——铁路列车运行图更为准确、具体、切合实际，于七月二十五日发出“关于制定和实行紧密运行图的指示”。指示全文如下：（一）
    两个月来，迅速发展着的满载、超轴、五百公里运动，向铁路各级领导机关尖锐地提出了一项严重的任务，这就是要求我们必须迅速而正确地进行一系列的技术管理的改革工作，而目前技术管理改革工作的中心环节就是迅速制定和实行紧密运行图。两个月来运动的经验证明：由于有系统地推广各种先进工作方法，一方面极为有效地提高了生产运输效率，另一方面也暴露了铁道工作中的各种矛盾。例如，运输能力提高，而货物运输量不足；车辆装载量提高，而装车任务亏欠；机车能提前到发，列车不能及时接续，因而机车等待列车，或者列车等待机车；超轴吨数增多，车辆的集结时间延长；先进的单位提前完成任务，落后单位不能协调前进；各种生产定额普遍提高，而工资、工时、劳动组织等未能及时改善。诸如此类的矛盾，说明了我们许多陈旧的经营管理制度已经和迅速发展着的生产力不相适应，促使着各级领导必须迅速地加以改革，以先进的经验来提高落后单位，作到有计划有节奏地进行生产。否则，在铁路这个庞大的联动机的若干环节上继续发展着的不协调的现象，就会严重地损害铁路生产的纪律性，迟滞整个生产力的继续发展。目前解决上述矛盾的首要方法是制定和实行
    一个组织缜密技术良好的紧密运行图。两个月来运动的发展，已使今年夏季所颁布的列车运行图远远地落后于实际，要求我们必须争取一切时间作好紧密运行图的工作。只有正确地解决这个重大问题，才能使满载、超轴、五百公里运动稳步而迅速地发展，才能使先进带动落后达到普遍的提高，才能够克服在前进的道路上所产生的不平衡和不协调。（二）
    紧密运行图系综合了现行的各种先进的技术作业指标并进一步推广各种先进工作方法，以便加速机车、车辆周转的新的列车运行图。紧密运行图和今年夏季所颁布的列车运行图在内容和效果上有着重大的区别。首先，紧密运行图是建筑在各种先进技术作业指标基础上的，因此就能有效地发挥设备能力和提高员工的技术。第二，紧密运行图和过去的列车运行图不同之点，还在于过去的运行图是根据计算，查定出列车对数，再按此规定机车交路〔注一〕。而紧密运行图则不然，它首先要考虑机车交路，再以此配合适当的车流〔注二〕，组织列车有计划地运行（当然，这不等于只单纯地照顾机车交路而否定了以车流为主体的基本原则），实行紧密运行图，不仅能加速车辆的周转，而且能加速机车的周转。第三，紧密运行图主要是遵照铁道部规定办法及铁路管理局指示由各铁路分局具体制定的。因此制定紧密运行图，能够而且必须广泛地吸收先进工作者意见，细致地研究和调查各方面的情况，自然也就可能作到更加符合于实际。这个先进的运行图最初是由先进的司机如王吉奎、郑锡坤、乔玉岩、郭树德、侯景明、袁自文、于国祥等和先进的调度员如王震、孙孝菊、张殿奎等学会了苏联的先进方法，从实践中创造出宝贵的经验，再经过苏联专家从技术理论上加以总结和提高所形成的，因之这一富于创造性和生命力并切合实际需要的紧密运行图，就成为我们当前改善运输工作的一个最有力的武器。（三）
    制定紧密运行图是一个复杂的技术组织工作和新旧思想尖锐斗争的过程，必须适当占有铁路运输工作中各种资料，并经过研究分析和科学计算工作，才能做好，因此要求各级党和行政领导干部在制定紧密运行图的过程中，必须掌握以下几个基本原则：
    首先，在思想领导上必须树立整体观念，坚决地反对各种形式的本位主义思想。有些人认为提高了机车日车公里就难以缩短车辆的中转、停留时间，要缩短车辆的中转、停留时间就难以提高机车日车公里；要节约机车的使用台数就难以节约车辆，要节约车辆就难以节省机车；只看到本管内局部的“利益”而看不到给邻区造成的困难，只照顾本管内的机车交路，而不照顾邻管区的机车交路；只为本管内列车接续的方便，不问邻区段列车接续是否困难。应当指出：诸如此类的不顾整体的思想，就是缺乏国家观念。在制定紧密运行图时，必须坚决向这种本位主义思想和保守落后思想进行不调和的斗争，必须坚持以运输为主体，把加速车辆周转和加速机车周转结成一体，区段列车必须服从直达列车，局部利益必须服从国家利益。
    第二，从分析实际出发，掌握货流〔注三〕、车流的规律。制定紧密运行图必须从分析实际情况入手，查定车次，固定列车对数。但由于货源不足，计划不准确，货流、车流经常发生变化，因之掌握不住货流和车流，就使整个运输计划工作陷于被动。的确，在目前情况下，是有客观困难的。但是有些领导干部和运输管理人员把客观困难加以夸大化，认为是“无法掌握货流、车流，而且必须服从货流、车流的支配”，因此也就放弃了固定车次〔注四〕和固定机车交路的努力，盲目地强调必须“随机应变发挥创造性”，结果就造成天天“跑现点”〔注五〕、随意变点、无计划地停运〔注六〕、复活〔注七〕。这种放任自流毫不负责的严重违犯纪律现象是绝对不能允许的。造成这种现象的根本原因，是由于领导方面缺乏检查，对货源、货流缺乏经常的调查、统计和研究，预报不正确；对上下内外缺乏密切联系。
    货流车流是根据国家每一时期的运输计划所确定的。但这并不能说各级铁路领导机关就不需要主动去掌握其规律性。尤其在目前国家运输尚不能全部精密计划的情况下，就更需要各级铁路领导机关主动地去掌握，从分析实际情况入手，加强调查、统计和研究工作。根据运输计划和过去的实际情况，应特别注意以下几点：一、掌握分界口〔注八〕，了解分界口经常从邻局交来那些车次、车种、货物类别、到开时间，把经常开行的列车车次作为核心列车固定下来。二、深入地了解本管内的货源、货流情况，装车卸车情况，把本管内经常保证开行的车次也作为核心列车固定下来。三、把本局和从邻局接运的经常开行的车次作为本区段内的核心列车固定之后，就可以适当地固定机车交路。四、运量有变化时，可根据情况采用分号运行图〔注九〕。如果临时有新变化，可用超轴加以调剂。应当肯定地认识：只要我们从实际出发，开动脑筋，加强调查工作，改善预报工作，我们完全有可能改变这种被动的情况，完全能够主动地掌握车流货流的规律性。
    第三，选定平均先进标准。紧密运行图是各业务单位技术作业过程的综合，在目前情况下，各种技术指标是参差不齐的，大部分地区还没有经过科学的查定和计算工作，因此只能从目前已经实际达到的技术指标当中结合计算工作吸收群众意见确定合理的先进指标作为我们此次制定紧密运行图的依据。根据已有的经验，选定平均先进标准，是最为适宜的。这就是说，不是根据个别先进人物创造的突出纪录为依据，而是以大多数先进人物所达到的平均标准为依据。自然这个平均的先进标准和一般员工所能达到的还有一定距离。但如果没有这个距离，就失掉了积极地组织动员和普遍提高的作用。在确定各种标准当中，应特别注意下面几项：一、怎样缩短机车在自外站、段的停留时间；二、怎样提高区间运转时分和旅行速度；三、怎样缩短车站、列车检查和机务段的技术作业时间。当然所有这些技术作业过程的紧缩，必须建筑在科学的基础上和可能的范围内，违犯了安全条件和过分增加员工的劳动强度是绝对不能允许的。
    第四，贯彻群众路线，广泛地采纳先进工作者的意见。制定一个先进的切合实际的紧密运行图，不仅要依靠工程师、调度员和行车计划人员，而且要广泛地吸收先进工作者的意见。因为这是一个极为复杂的技术组织工作和行车计划工作，必须有丰富的材料和正确的思想指导。广大员工特别是他们中间的优秀人物，像执行作战计划的战斗员一样，对每一布置都有极深刻的体验。因此各分局在制定紧密运行图之前，应深入现场，召开各种形式的先进工作者代表会或座谈会，组织调度员添乘〔注十〕，征询各方面意见，然后汇总起来，再根据运输计划、设备条件，员工技术水平，经过计算之后，进行制图工作。在经过反复的修订之后，送报上级批准。这样，并不会拖延时间，相反地是争取时间提高效率的有效办法。
    第五，为所有运用机车的司机创造五百公里的工作条件。过去的经验证明：在运动发展的初期阶段，领导方面有意识地使少数的或一小部分机车按机车紧密运行图来运行，是一种先进的方法。因为当时大部分司机都缺乏良好的技术和经验。一部分司机先按五百公里交路运行，既能取得经验，又为普遍开展创造条件。但是，现在的情况已经不同了，大部地区的大部分司机不仅取得经验，而且初步地掌握了快速牵引的技术。如果现在还仅仅给一小部分司机造成五百公里的工作条件，就会使非五百公里的司机失掉了积极争取的可能。这样也就限制五百公里司机人员的增长，阻碍着满载、超轴、五百公里运动的发展。因此制定机车周转紧密运行图时，应当逐步地作到为所有司机造成五百公里的条件。虽然这须要经过一个过程，但要尽量地缩短这个时间。（四）
    制定出紧密运行图仅仅是工作开始，认真地贯彻执行坚持下去，比制定过程会遇到更多的困难。因此要求作到以下几点：
    第一，全党动员，全体干部从各方面去进行贯彻。运行图是铁路各单位总的技术作业过程和工作计划，每一个员工都应当为紧密运行图的贯彻执行，尽自己工作内应尽的职责。因此必须纠正把执行运行图仅仅看成是少数调度员和运输管理人员的事情的看法。各部门必须制定自己的工作计划，在运行图规定下坚决地有纪律地工作。
    第二，各业务单位必须在紧密运行图公布实行的同时，规定出一系列的技术组织措施，如普遍推行苏德尼果夫的新调度法，平衡全国各主要干线的牵引定数，制定新的车站技术作业过程，拟定提高技术速度和旅行速度的具体办法，实行循环运转制和提高机车质量，改善号志和通讯设备，提高线路质量，消灭徐行，鉴定桥梁，整顿装卸组织，缩短装载作业时间，消灭燃轴和制动不良事故等。
    第三，要求各级政治机关，加强员工的纪律教育，使每个职工懂得：“铁路运输应成为一种工作明晰，动作正确，犹如良好钟表机械一样的联动机”。这是我们铁路运输纪律的本质，而整个铁路联动机不间断地工作，是和每个员工自己的组织性、纪律性分不开的。政治部（铁路上党的战斗机关）和各级党的组织，怎样保证铁路各个环节能够精确地协调地进行工作，应成为经常的战斗任务。全路已进入生产改革为中心的新阶段，党的工作、政治工作、工会工作、青年团工作必须把进一步提高运输效率作为一切工作的中心，并围绕这一中心工作，改善自己的工作。
