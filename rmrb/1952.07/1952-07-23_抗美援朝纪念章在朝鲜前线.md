    Anti-US and Aid-Korea Commemorative Medal on the Korean Front
    Editor's Note: The Volunteer Army comrades were very excited after the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medals were distributed to the Korean front. Recently, this newspaper has successively received many letters and articles from commanders and combatants of the Volunteer Army. These letters and articles reflect the enthusiastic scenes when the Volunteer Army's various departments issued the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medals. Three articles are selected and published below:
    (I) Dear parents, brothers, and sisters of the motherland!
    We have worn the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal presented to us by the people of the motherland on our chests since June 6th. This commemorative medal, with a golden halo surrounding a red five-pointed star, and a portrait of Chairman Mao on the red five-pointed star, is so solemn, generous, beautiful, and dazzling! The comrades looked at it again and again, stroked it again and again, and then hung it squarely on their chests, and raised their heads. Everyone smiled in unison. In various different smiles, there is a common will: "Guarantee not to disappoint the hopes of the people of the motherland!"
    On June 6th, our company held a company-wide medal awarding ceremony. The venue was arranged in the company headquarters' courtyard, and the rostrum was built with tarpaulins. Although the arrangement was simple, it was very solemn. The company commander first explained to us the great significance of issuing the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal. He talked about the US imperialism launching the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the great victories of the five battles, the Korean armistice negotiations, and the support of the people of the motherland to the issuing of the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal... The comrades listened quietly, with expressions of love and hate on their faces from time to time. After the meeting, we also performed some recreational programs and spent this grand day excitedly and happily.
    Dear parents, brothers, and sisters of the motherland, the golden light of the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal will always shine on our chests, and your hopes for us will always be remembered in our hearts. We guarantee not to disappoint your hopes and resolutely complete the glorious tasks you have entrusted to us!
            All Comrades of a Certain Logistics Department Company of the Volunteer Army
    (II)
    The Korean fields in June are covered with golden wheat ears, and green crops are interspersed in the wheat ridges. The soldiers are active in the deep mountain ravines, fighting tenaciously with the American aerial bandits.
    The soldiers had just come down from the hot hillside, their bodies covered in sweat. Suddenly, exciting news came from the team headquarters: the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal has been issued! This news quickly caused a sensation among the soldiers. Everyone rushed to the team headquarters as if they were charging, all vying to see this long-awaited commemorative medal. The leader took out a glittering gold medal, and everyone carefully looked at it and said: "This is the heart of the people of the motherland," "This is the high honor bestowed on us by the people of the motherland!"
    On the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against aggression, we held a grand swearing-in medal awarding ceremony. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Xuedao, who had performed meritorious service in the Fifth Battle, said to everyone: "We must better practice our skills and strive for greater achievements in order to maintain the high honor bestowed on us by Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland!" Then, everyone scrambled to express their attitude, pouring out all their thoughts. After the meeting, many comrades were jumping and singing: The Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal, hanging on my chest, flashing and shining with golden light, I feel full of strength. Tomorrow I will go to the battlefield, and I will kill more American wolfish ambitionists. Next year, I will wear several hero medals on my chest!

        (III)
    On the afternoon of June 14th, I was chatting with Fang Jian, the company commander of a certain railway corps of the Volunteer Army. He told me two stories about how the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal inspired the soldiers' fighting will.
    Under the frenzied bombing of the American aerial bandits, the comrades had not slept for two days. On the third day, the line was more severely damaged by the enemy, but the military transport requirements had to be restored to traffic within 24 hours. With only half an hour left, only half of the task had been completed. The comrades did feel a little tired, and some were already sitting on the ground to rest. At this time, a comrade stood on a large rock and shouted: "Comrades, what are you wearing on your chests?" A short sentence seemed to ignite a fire in the hearts of every comrade. Everyone plunged into work as if in battle. At 23:50, trains pulling green smoke passed smoothly through the railway that everyone had just built, ensuring the supply of military needs.
    Once, when a repair team of a certain railway unit was carrying out repair work, Wang Hui, a member of the Youth League, had his right leg broken by flying stones from an enemy plane bomb, and was bleeding badly. The captain and other comrades asked him to rest, but he replied: "I can hold on, I must resolutely complete the task." At dinner, I asked him what force made him so brave and strong. He took out a diary from his pocket, opened a page and handed it to me, saying that this was what he wrote on the day he received the Anti-US and Aid-Korea commemorative medal:
    "... Commemorative medal! You represent the will of 500 million people of the motherland. You will encourage me to be brave and brave, to advance and advance! I am excited for you, and I am willing to dedicate everything for you!"

### 抗美援朝纪念章在朝鲜前线

    抗美援朝纪念章在朝鲜前线
    编者按：抗美援朝纪念章发到朝鲜前线后，志愿军同志们都非常兴奋。最近本报陆续接到许多志愿军的指挥员、战斗员的来信来稿。这些信件和文章，反映了志愿军各个部门颁发抗美援朝纪念章时的热烈情景。现选择三篇发表于后：（一）亲爱的祖国父母兄弟姊妹们！
    祖国人民赠给我们的抗美援朝纪念章，我们已于六月六日戴在胸前了。这个金黄色围着红五星、红五星上有着毛主席像的纪念章，是多么庄严、大方、美丽、光耀夺目啊！同志们拿着它看了又看，抚摸了又抚摸，然后才把它端端正正地挂在胸前，抬起头来，大家都不约而同地微笑了。在各种不同的微笑中，却蕴藏着共同的意志：“保证不辜负祖国人民对我们的希望！”
    六月六日那天，我们连队里召开了全连的授章典礼大会。会场就布置在连部的院子里，主席台用雨布搭成。布置虽然简陋，却很庄严。连长首先给我们讲解了颁发抗美援朝纪念章的重大意义。他从美帝国主义发动侵朝战争讲到中国人民的抗美援朝运动，从五次战役的大捷讲到朝鲜停战谈判，又从祖国人民的支援讲到颁发抗美援朝纪念章……。同志们都静悄悄地听着，脸上不时地呈现出爱和恨的表情。会后，我们还演出了一些游艺节目，兴奋、愉快地度过了这个隆重的日子。
    亲爱的祖国父老兄弟姊妹们，抗美援朝纪念章的金光将永远闪耀在我们的胸前，你们对于我们的希望也将永远记在我们的心里，我们保证不辜负你们的希望，坚决完成你们所交给我们的光荣任务！
            志愿军后勤部某连全体同志（二）
    六月的朝鲜田野里铺满了金黄色的麦穗，麦垅中还夹杂着葱绿色的庄稼。战士们活跃在深山沟壑里，和美国空中强盗进行着顽强的斗争。
    战士们刚从炎热的山坡上走下来，混身都沾满了汗水。忽然从队部里传来了令人兴奋的消息：抗美援朝纪念章发下来了！这个消息很快在战士中间轰动起来，大家好像冲锋似地蜂拥到队部里去，都争着要看看这个渴望已久的纪念章。首长拿出来一枚金光耀目的纪念章，大家都仔细打量着说：“这是祖国人民的心”，“这是祖国人民赠给我们的崇高荣誉！”
    在纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争两周年的那天，我们举行了隆重的宣誓授章大会。会上，曾在第五次战役立了功的刘学道同志向大家表示：“我们一定要更好地练好本领，争取功上加功，来保持毛主席和祖国人民授予我们的崇高荣誉！”接着，大家都争着要表示自己的态度，把心里的话全盘倾吐出来。会后，许多同志还跳着唱着：抗美援朝纪念章，挂在我胸前，忽闪忽闪发金光，我觉得混身都有力量。明天上战场，一定多杀美国野心狼。到明年，胸前要带上几个英雄章！陈明光
        （三）
    六月十四日下午，我和志愿军铁道兵团某连连长方健同志闲聊天，他给我讲了两个抗美援朝纪念章鼓舞战士们战斗意志的故事。
    在美国空中强盗的狂轰滥炸下，同志们已经两天没有睡觉了。第三天，线路被敌人破坏得更严重，但军运的要求必须在二十四小时以内恢复通车。眼看时间只剩一点半钟，任务却仅完成了一半。同志们的确感觉有些疲倦，有的已坐在地上休息。这时，一个同志站在一块大石头上喊：“同志们，你们胸前挂的是什么？”简短的一句话，好像烈火燃烧在每一个同志的心坎里，大家像战斗似地投入工作。到二十三点五十分，一列列拖着青烟的火车，顺利地通过了大伙刚修筑成的铁道，保证了军需的供应。
    有一次，某铁道部队的抢修队在进行抢修工作时，青年团员王辉的右腿被敌机炸弹炸起来的飞石击破，血流得很厉害。队长和其他同志都要他去休息，他回答说：“支持得住，要坚决完成任务。”晚饭时，我问他什么力量使他这样勇敢和坚强。他从口袋里掏出一本日记本，翻开了一页递给我说，这是他领到抗美援朝纪念章那天写的：
    “……纪念章啊！你代表着五亿祖国人民的意志。你将时时刻刻鼓舞着我勇敢再勇敢，前进更前进！我为你而兴奋，我愿意为你而献出我的一切！”
