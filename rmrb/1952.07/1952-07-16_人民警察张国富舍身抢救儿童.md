    People's Policeman Zhang Guofu Heroically Saves a Child
    On the evening of June 2nd, the people of Huangshaxi and Hegaoyan in the suburbs of Chongqing, with tears in their eyes, were discussing the moving story of People's Policeman Zhang Guofu who sacrificed his life to save a child.
    Comrade Zhang Guofu was a clerk at the Huangshaxi Police Station in the suburbs of Chongqing. At 5:00 PM on June 2nd, he went from Huangshaxi to Hegaoyan along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on official business. When he reached Xinhuang Village, the second train from Caiba Station passed by. More than ten feet away from Comrade Zhang Guofu, there was a child of about ten years old, carrying a basket, picking firewood on the railway. Comrade Zhang Guofu quickly waved and shouted, "Child, get out of the way, the train is coming!" The child did not hear him and continued walking on the railway. At this time, the train was approaching, and the child was very panicked and did not know what to do. Comrade Zhang Guofu immediately ran to the railway and pulled the panicked child to the sidewalk outside the railway. As he had not yet gained a foothold, the locomotive had already passed by him. The wind from the train knocked him down. His head fell on the sleeper next to the track, and the footboard on the speeding carriage broke the back of his head. He fainted. The masses immediately carried him to the Hegaoyan Police Station, gave him a shot of stimulant, and then sent him to the Second People's Hospital of Chongqing. However, he died due to excessive blood loss. That night, the masses carried Comrade Zhang Guofu's body back to the Huangshaxi Police Station. Residents of Huangshaxi and Hegaoyan came to the police station in the dark to pay their respects to Comrade Zhang Guofu's remains. Until two o'clock in the morning, there were still people reluctant to leave.
    Comrade Zhang Guofu was from Pujiang County, Zhejiang Province, and was thirty-three years old. He grew up in a peasant family. He worked in a factory from 1938. After the liberation of Chongqing, he was transferred to the Fourth Branch of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau as a gatekeeper. Last June, he was transferred to the Huangshaxi Police Station as a gatekeeper. During the "Three-Anti" movement, he was promoted to clerk. The Party and superiors constantly educated him, and Comrade Zhang Guofu always faithfully adhered to the duties of a people's policeman. When he was a gatekeeper, he was never late for work once. After being transferred to clerk, the food in the station was significantly improved under his proper management. Usually, Comrade Zhang Guofu did not have patrol duties, but whenever he had free time, he would go out to work with the comrades performing patrol duties. Comrade Zhang Guofu was very concerned about the working people. He was paid a salary, but he rarely spent money and often lent his surplus money to poor residents. Chen Tianyi, a bamboo shed worker, borrowed money from him and overcame the difficulties during the lean season. The day after Comrade Zhang Guofu's sacrifice, Chen Tianyi returned the 300,000 yuan that Comrade Zhang Guofu had lent him to the comrade in charge of the police station. He said sadly, "Comrade Zhang is dead, I can't return the borrowed money to him personally!"
    The working people of Huangshaxi were very saddened to hear the news that Comrade Zhang, who had close ties with them, had heroically sacrificed himself to save a child. Everyone requested that the police station hold a memorial service for Comrade Zhang Guofu. The police station held a memorial service on the afternoon of June 3rd. At the meeting, people from Huangshaxi and Hegaoyan sent many elegiac couplets and wreaths. Many people at the meeting recalled Comrade Zhang Guofu's love for the people during his lifetime and wept bitterly.

    人民警察张国富舍身抢救儿童
    六月二日晚间，重庆市郊黄沙溪、鹤皋岩一带的人民，含着热泪，谈论着人民警察张国富为了抢救儿童而牺牲了自己的生命的动人事迹。
    张国富同志是重庆市郊黄沙溪派出所的事务员。六月二日下午五时，他从黄沙溪沿着成渝铁路到鹤皋岩去办公事。他走到新黄村时，从菜园坝出发的第二班火车开过来了。在距张国富同志一丈多远的地方，有一个十岁左右的孩子，背着箩筐，在铁道上走着拾柴。张国富同志急忙挥手大喊：“孩子，快躲开，火车来了！”那孩子没有听见，仍在铁道上走着。这时火车已经逼近了，小孩十分惊慌，不知如何是好。张国富同志立刻跑到铁道上，将惊慌失措的孩子拉到铁道外的人行道上。当他立足未稳的时候，机车已经驶过他的身边。列车带着的风势把他卷倒了。他的头倒在铁轨旁的枕木上，向前急驶的车厢上的踏板打破了他的后脑。他昏过去了。群众立刻把他抬到鹤皋岩派出所，打了一针强心针，再送到重庆市第二人民医院。但因流血过多，不治而死。当晚，群众又将张国富同志的遗体抬回黄沙溪派出所。黄沙溪、鹤皋岩一带的居民都摸着黑路，到派出所来瞻仰张国富同志的遗容。一直到深夜两点钟，还有群众舍不得离去。
    张国富同志，浙江浦江县人，现年三十三岁，生长在一个农民的家庭。他从一九三八年起在工厂做工，重庆解放后，被调到重庆公安第四分局当门警。去年六月，上级又调他到黄沙溪派出所当门警，“三反”运动中把他提升为事务员。党和上级不断地对他进行教育，张国富同志始终不渝地忠实于人民警察的职守。他在当门警时，从来没有迟上班一次。调任事务员后，在他的妥善管理下，所里的伙食显著地改善了。平时张国富同志是没有巡逻任务的，但他只要一有空闲，就跟着执行巡逻任务的同志一起出去工作。张国富同志非常关心劳动人民，他是薪金制待遇，但他很少花钱，常把自己积余的钱借给穷苦居民。篾棚工人陈天益借了他的钱，度过了青黄不接时的困难。在张国富同志牺牲后的第二天，陈天益把张国富同志借给他的三十万元交还给派出所负责同志，他难过地说：“张同志死了，我不能把借的钱还给他本人了！”
    黄沙溪的劳动人民听到平时和他们有着密切联系的张同志为了抢救儿童英勇殉职的消息，大家都很悲痛，要求派出所为张国富同志举行追悼会。派出所在六月三日下午召开了追悼会。会上，黄沙溪、鹤皋岩一带人民送来很多挽联、花圈，很多人在会上回忆着张国富同志生前对人民的热爱，都痛哭流涕。            李枫
