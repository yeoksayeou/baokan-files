　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 21st: Our special correspondent reports: Peace-loving people all over the world are very concerned about the Panmunjom armistice talks. Although the latest situation of the meeting is unknown, a series of provocative actions by the US side outside the Panmunjom tents cast an ominous shadow on people's hearts. In addition to the US invading air force's wanton bombing of non-military targets in the Korean rear—peaceful cities, peaceful facilities, peaceful residents including the old, weak, women, and children—and continuous direct violations of our Northeast China airspace, there have recently been repeated hawkish and provocative statements by US generals. One cannot help but suspect: Since US generals are keen on playing with the adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure," and since they harbor the sinister intention of continuing and expanding the Korean War, which people all over the world are eager to end, what sincerity do they have in the just cause of achieving peace in Korea at an early date on a fair and reasonable basis?

　　It is seen that: Precisely when the US invading air force is carrying out brutal concentrated bombings of peaceful cities and towns in the Korean rear and carrying out provocative actions of directly violating our Northeast China airspace, US Army Chief of Staff Collins and Chief of Naval Operations Fechteler have arrived in Korea one after another. It is also heard that: Precisely when new provocations and actions to undermine the armistice talks by the US side are emerging one after another, these two US generals have issued frenzied war-mongering and provocative statements.

　　On the 14th, Collins, at a press conference in Seoul, stated that the US Air Force would continue to carry out "fierce air strikes" on Korea, and threatened: "If the situation becomes urgent, we can use other forces." When answering reporters' questions, Collins made no secret of the arrogant plan of the US aggressors to expand the war to our Northeast China. He said: "If necessary, the theater commander Clark has the local authority to take action against Manchuria." On the 15th, Collins repeated the same shameless clamor at a press conference in Tokyo, and further threatened: "If necessary, the United Nations will not hesitate to use all necessary means against the enemy."

　　On the 17th, Fechteler issued equally arrogant and hawkish remarks at a press conference in Tokyo. He said: "General Clark has the right to order the Allied forces to bomb Manchuria"; and said: "General Clark has been given the power to order the Navy to enter Manchuria under certain circumstances"; and also said: "As soon as the order is given, the Navy can launch amphibious assaults on North Korea."

　　The frantic and hawkish provocative remarks of the US generals obviously have the nature of intimidation, but for the heroic and strong Korean and Chinese people, any intimidation by the US aggressors will never achieve its purpose. These remarks by US generals also clearly indicate a practical premeditation by the US aggressors to expand the war, but the heroic and strong Korean and Chinese people are not afraid of this premeditation by the US aggressors. If the stupid US generals, who only understand the language of "force," dare to expand the war, then they will be smashed to pieces before the copper walls and iron ramparts of the Korean and Chinese people's forces. The Korean and Chinese people have a firm will and invincible power to resist US imperialist aggression, defend the independence of their motherland, and strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. As is well known, in the two years of the Korean War, the Korean and Chinese people have inflicted severe blows on the US aggressors, forcing them to sit down for negotiations; and during the year of negotiations, the Korean and Chinese people have continuously bankrupted the so-called "military pressure" policy of the US aggressors. Obviously, for the Korean and Chinese people, the hawkish remarks of the US generals, whether they are empty threats or a practical premeditation, are of no use whatsoever.

　　It is not difficult to see that the remarks of Collins and Fechteler prove that the US government currently has no sincerity in achieving a Korean armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis. And this is precisely what once again exposes the US aggressors as the enemy of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Therefore, it is precisely the war cries of the US generals that have raised the vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world about the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, and increasingly understand that only by taking active actions and effective measures to stop the actions of the US aggressors to undermine negotiations and expand the war can it help to win and defend world peace. That is why the remarks of Collins and Fechteler are bound to be condemned and opposed by just public opinion all over the world.

　　It is becoming increasingly difficult for the US aggressors to pursue their policies of aggression and war. The remarks of Collins and Fechteler not only did not scare the Korean and Chinese people, but on the contrary, caused real unease within the aggressive bloc. This situation has already been reflected in the British Parliament. On the 16th, British Labour Party MP Stansgate questioned British Foreign Office Under-Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs Reading about the US general's remarks. Stansgate asked Reading if the British government "is aware that public opinion is becoming increasingly uneasy about the fact that we are completely relying on military means to end a dangerous situation that is essentially political?". Stansgate's concerns are justified, because the US aggressors' policy of undermining negotiations and expanding the war is not only making itself but also its puppet governments increasingly face the strong anger and opposition of their own people. As International News Service admitted in a dispatch on the 13th: "Striving to end the two-year war in Korea is not only the demand of the communist parties and extreme leftists in European countries, but also some conservative newspapers have echoed this view." International News Service admitted that "responsible leaders of European governments" are facing the increasingly rising demand for "striving for peace in Korea at any cost," and that it is "increasingly difficult" to fight against this demand. Even a cunning politician like Churchill is powerless to quell people's criticism of the US policy of continuing the Korean War, because "the basic difficulty they have when arguing with these people is that these people believe the Korean War is a 'bad war'."

　　In front of the Korean and Chinese people who uphold justice, the US aggressors should not even think about obtaining what they vainly attempt to obtain on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. People understand the remarks of Collins and Fechteler precisely from this point of view. Since their remarks prove that the US aggressors are determined to disregard the peaceful wishes of the people all over the world, and deliberately delay and undermine the armistice negotiations, and attempt to continue and expand the Korean War through this, then the US government bears a serious responsibility for delaying and undermining the Korean armistice negotiations.

### 美国陆军参谋长及海军作战部长  柯林斯和费泰勒疯狂叫嚣扩大侵朝战争

    美国陆军参谋长及海军作战部长
    柯林斯和费泰勒疯狂叫嚣扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者报道：全世界爱好和平的人民都十分关切板门店停战谈判会议，虽然会议的最近情况不得而知，但是，美方在板门店帐篷外面的一连串挑衅行动却在人们的心上投下了不祥的暗影。除了美国侵朝空军对朝鲜后方的非军事目标——和平城市、和平设施、和平的老弱妇孺等居民肆行狂轰滥炸，并对我国东北领空进行连续的直接的侵犯之外，最近又加上美国将军们发表接二连三的好战的挑拨性言论。人们不能不怀疑：美国将军们既然热衷于玩弄所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策，既然抱有继续和扩大全世界人民渴望终止的朝鲜战争的祸心，他们对于在公平合理基础上早日获致朝鲜和平这样的正义事业还有什么诚意。
    人们看到：正是在美国侵朝空军对朝鲜后方和平城乡实行残暴的集中轰炸，并对我国东北领空进行直接侵犯的挑衅活动之际，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯和海军作战部长费泰勒先后到达了朝鲜。人们也听到：正是在美方这种新的挑衅和破坏停战谈判的行动层出不穷的时候，这两位美国将军发表了疯狂的叫嚣战争的挑拨性言论。
    十四日，柯林斯在汉城记者招待会上，表示美国空军将继续对朝鲜实行“猛烈的空袭”，并且威胁着说：“一旦情况紧急，我们可以使用其他武力。”柯林斯在回答记者问题时，毫不隐瞒美国侵略者抱有把战争扩大到我国东北的狂妄打算。他说：“如果必要时，战区司令官克拉克有局部的权力对满洲采取行动。”十五日，柯林斯在东京记者招待会上重复了同样无耻的叫嚣，还进一步威胁着说：“如有必要时，联合国不惜对敌人使用一切必要的手段。”
    十七日，费泰勒在东京记者招待会上发出了同样狂妄的好战言论。他说：“克拉克将军有权命令联军轰炸满洲”；并说：“克拉克将军业已被赋予在某种情况下得下令海军进入满洲之权”；还说：“只要命令一下，海军就可以对北朝鲜进行两栖袭击”。
    美国将军们的这种疯狂的好战的挑拨性言论，显然带有恫吓的性质，但是，对于英勇而坚强的朝中人民说来，美国侵略者的任何恫吓都是永远达不到目的的。美国将军们这种言论显然也是表示美国侵略者抱有扩大战争的一种实际预谋，但是，英勇而坚强的朝中人民对于美国侵略者的这种预谋是无所畏惧的，如果只懂得“武力”这一种语言的美国愚蠢的将军们胆敢扩大战争，那末，他们就要在朝中人民力量的铜墙铁壁面前碰得头破血流。朝中人民对于反抗美帝国主义的侵略，保卫自己祖国的独立，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，具有坚强的意志和不可战胜的力量。如所周知，在两年朝鲜战争中，朝中人民曾予美国侵略者以严重的打击，迫使他们不得不坐下来谈判；而在一年的谈判期间，朝中人民又曾不断使美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”政策归于破产。显而易见，对于朝中人民说来，美国将军们的好战言论，无论它是虚声恫吓也好，或是一种实际预谋也好，都是没有丝毫用处的。
    人们不难看出，柯林斯和费泰勒的言论，证明了美国政府目前并没有在公平合理基础上获致朝鲜停战协议的诚意。而正是这一点，再一次暴露了美国侵略者是世界爱好和平人民的敌人。
    因此，正是美国将军们的战争叫嚣，使全世界爱好和平的人民对远东日益严重的局势提高了警觉，而日益了解：只有积极行动起来，采取有效办法制止美国侵略者破坏谈判、扩大战争的行动，才能有助于争取和保卫世界的和平。这就是为什么柯林斯和费泰勒的言论必定受到全世界正义舆论的指责和反对的原故。
    美国侵略者要想推行它的侵略政策和战争政策是越来越困难了。柯林斯和费泰勒的言论不仅没有吓倒朝中人民，相反的，在侵略集团内部倒引起了真正的不安。这种情况，已经在英国国会中反映了出来。十六日，英国工党议员斯坦斯盖特曾就美国将军的谈话向英国外交部驻议会次官里丁提出质问。斯坦斯盖特质问里丁说，英国政府“是否知道，使人认为我们完全依靠军事手段来结束本质上是政治性的危险情势，舆论日益感到极其不安？”。斯坦斯盖特的担心是有理由的，因为美国侵略者破坏谈判、扩大战争的政策不仅使它自己也使它的仆从国政府日益面对着其本国人民的强烈的愤怒和反对。正如国际新闻社十三日电所承认：“尽力争取停止朝鲜两年来的战争，不仅是欧洲各国共产党和极端左翼人士的要求，某些保守的报界人士也都附和这种主张。”国际新闻社承认：“欧洲各国政府的负责领袖”正面临着日益高涨的“不惜任何代价争取朝鲜和平”的要求，而要和这种要求作斗争，“正日益艰难”，就是像邱吉尔那样老奸巨滑的政客，要想平息人们对于美国继续进行朝鲜战争的政策的批评也无能为力，因为“他们和这些人辩论时，基本的困难便是这些人认为朝鲜战争是一个‘不好的战争’”。
    在坚持正义主张的朝中人民面前，美国侵略者休想取得它在战场上和谈判桌上妄想取得的东西。人们正是从这一点来了解柯林斯和费泰勒的言论。既然他们的言论证明美国侵略者决心不顾全世界人民的和平愿望，而蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判，并企图借以继续和扩大朝鲜战争，那末，美国政府就对拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判负有严重的责任。
