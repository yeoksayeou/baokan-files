Hebei Lixian County Farmer Wang Dashan
Organizes Neighboring Households to Expand Irrigation Area and Overcome Drought

In the 1951 anti-drought sowing and seedling protection movement, farmers in Linbao Village, Lixian County, Hebei Province, united and helped each other, and rationally used manpower, animal power, and existing waterwheels. As a result, the irrigated area of ​​the village's eighty-seven water wells expanded from 1,942 mu to 6,000 mu. The average irrigated area per well increased from more than 22 mu to nearly 70 mu, expanding the irrigated area by more than two times, overcoming the drought. The village increased its production of seed cotton by 100,232 jin (approximately equivalent to 300,000 jin of rice) due to the expansion of the irrigated area. Wang Dashan and twenty-six neighboring households organized to irrigate the land, and came up with many methods to save water and improve irrigation efficiency, which increased the irrigation area of ​​a water well from 29 mu to 148 mu, expanding the irrigation area by more than four times. Afterwards, they often maintained the rotation of more than 40 mu of crops and vegetables. Through the anti-drought sowing and seedling protection movement, the farmers in the village deeply realized that as long as they can organize to fight against natural disasters, drought can be completely overcome.

When the village was unable to sow due to the drought in the spring of 1951, the county and district leading organs sent an anti-drought work team to the village to lead the farmers in fighting the drought. After understanding the situation, it was found that breaking the farmers' backward thinking of relying on the heavens for food, and making full use of existing water sources to expand the scope of irrigation was the only way to overcome the drought and complete sowing. At this time, the work team successively held Party branch meetings, village cadre meetings, and mass meetings. At these meetings, the work team conducted profound patriotic education and united production education for the farmers, explaining that expanding the irrigation area of ​​waterwheels and wells was the only way to overcome the drought, and called on every household and neighboring household with waterwheels and wells to organize and jointly irrigate the land. After the meetings, more than 70 Party members and cadres in the village went to each household to carry out individual enlightenment education and solve specific problems. After in-depth publicity and education among the farmers in the village, the farmers' political consciousness was improved, and the farmers with waterwheels and wells enthusiastically responded to the call and voluntarily lent their land to neighboring households for irrigation. The entire village's manpower and animal power were organized and mobilized, forming a tense anti-drought sowing movement of non-stop irrigation day and night.

Wang Dashan himself had a better Bagua-style waterwheel, which used to only irrigate his own 29 mu of land. In this anti-drought movement, he was determined to expand the irrigation area, and successively united with Wang Shoushan and other 26 neighboring households to implement anti-drought sowing. First of all, he paid special attention to leading each household to irrigate the land in an organized and planned manner. Because there were too many irrigating households, he realized that if they were not well organized and arranged, the phenomenon of many people being busy and chaotic could not be avoided, which would be both labor-intensive and would not irrigate the land well. Therefore, he discussed with everyone to arrange the order of irrigation according to the order of sowing of each household, the distance of the land from the well, the amount of water required for each piece of land, and the strength of each household's manpower and animal power, irrigating the land in shifts day and night. Secondly, based on his own experience, he helped and mobilized each household to level the land and make ridges and ditches before watering, and irrigate the water into the ridges and ditches, which could save one-third of the water. After watering, he also often mobilized each household to diligently hoe and hoe shallowly to reduce the evaporation of water in the soil. In order to avoid waterwheel failures that would affect irrigation, he took every opportunity to educate everyone to carefully protect the waterwheel. He personally went to the well several times every day to check. Often late at night, he was still by the well checking the condition of the waterwheel irrigation. Due to Wang Dashan's enthusiastic unity, help, and diligent guidance to each household in irrigating the land in an orderly manner, the enthusiasm of everyone for anti-drought sowing was effectively encouraged. They irrigated the land non-stop day and night for more than 30 consecutive days, and successfully completed the anti-drought sowing task on 148 mu of land, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest.

    河北蠡县农民王大山
    组织地邻户扩大灌溉面积战胜干旱
    河北蠡县林堡村的农民在一九五一年抗旱播种和保苗保收运动中，团结互助，合理使用人力、畜力及原有水车，使全村八十七眼水井的浇地面积由一千九百四十二亩扩大到六千亩，每眼井平均浇地面积由二十二亩多提高到近七十亩，扩大了浇地面积两倍以上，战胜了干旱。全村因浇地面积的扩大而增产籽棉十万零二千三百二十斤（约折合米三十万斤）。这村农民王大山和二十六户地邻组织起来浇地，并想出很多节省水量提高浇地效率的方法，使一眼水井的灌溉面积由二十九亩提高到一百四十八亩，扩大浇地面积四倍以上，以后并经常保持四十亩以上的农作物和菜蔬的轮浇。经过抗旱播种和保苗保收运动，全村农民深刻认识到，只要能够组织起来向自然灾害作斗争，干旱是完全可以战胜的。
    这村在一九五一年春季干旱无法下种时，县、区领导机关曾派遣抗旱工作组到这村领导农民抗旱。经了解情况以后，发现打破农民靠天吃饭的落后思想，充分利用现有水源，扩大浇地范围，是战胜干旱完成播种的唯一办法。这时工作组就连续召开了党支部会议、村干部会议、群众大会。在这些会议上工作组对农民进行了深刻的爱国主义教育和团结生产的教育，说明扩大水车、水井的浇地面积是战胜干旱的唯一办法，号召各个有水车、水井的户和地邻户组织起来，合伙浇地。会议开完以后，全村七十多个党员、干部就分别到各户进行个别启发教育，解决具体问题。经对全村农民深入进行宣传教育以后，农民政治觉悟提高了，有水车、水井的农民，热烈响应号召，自愿借给地邻户浇地。全村的人力、畜力都组织动员起来，形成了日夜不停的紧张浇地的抗旱播种运动。
    王大山自己有一部较好的八卦式水车，以往只浇自己的二十九亩土地，在这次抗旱运动中，他决心扩大灌溉面积，先后联合了王寿山等二十六户地邻户实行抗旱播种。首先，他特别注意领导各户有组织地有计划地浇地。因为浇地户太多了，他体会到，如不组织好、安排好，就不能避免人多忙乱的现象，既费工，地也浇不好。于是和大家商量按各户播种的先后，土地离井远近，每片土地所需水量，及各户人力、畜力强弱等情况，安排好浇地的次序，昼夜轮流浇地。其次根据他自己的经验，帮助和动员各户，在浇水以前将地耙平，作好垄沟，把水灌到垄沟里，可节省三分之一的水量。浇地以后，他又经常发动各户勤锄浅锄，减少土壤里的水分蒸发。为了避免水车发生故障，影响浇地，一有机会，他便教育大家认真爱护水车。每天他都亲自到井旁看几次。往往到深夜，他还在井旁查看水车浇地的情况。由于王大山热心团结帮助并辛勤地指导各户有次序地浇地，有力地鼓舞了大家抗旱播种的情绪。他们连续三十多天昼夜不停地浇地，顺利完成了一百四十八亩地的抗旱播种任务，打下了丰收的基础。（徐达）
