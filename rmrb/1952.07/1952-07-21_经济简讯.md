　　The state-owned Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Manufacturing Factory vigorously launched a rationalization proposal campaign after the "Three-Anti" movement. In early April, they began to sort out the many suggestions that had been accumulated in the past and launched a campaign to propose rationalization suggestions. In April and May alone, the entire factory put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals, more than three times that of last year. During the campaign, not only did general workers actively put forward suggestions, but even apprentices and general staff members actively put forward suggestions. Yao Qingyun, an apprentice in the Riveting Department, put forward a rationalization proposal to improve auxiliary tools, which increased the efficiency of welding mine car axle rings by more than double. Liu Laibin, a draftsman in the Design Section, put forward five suggestions, four of which were approved and adopted, which could increase the country's wealth by more than 200 million yuan.

　　Sunan District Holds Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference

　　The Sunan District Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference was held in Wuxi City from July 5th to 15th. The transaction methods of the Sunan District Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference, in addition to large transactions, tried to take care of small transactions in many ways. From tens of thousands of yuan to tens of billions of yuan, they could be freely traded. At the same time, the exchange conference timely solved the supply problems of tea, brown sugar, tung oil, soybeans, and native paper, which are in great demand in the district and need to be purchased from outside the district. It also implemented the policy of matching fast-selling goods with slow-selling goods, and well-known brands with non-well-known brands, to promote the smooth progress of the conference transactions. Private merchants participating in the conference were very satisfied with this. Therefore, after the exchange conference started, the number of participants gradually increased from 1,500 to more than 6,000. Private merchants of all sizes in the district suddenly became active. Within seven days, 10,979 transactions were concluded, with a total purchase and sales amount of more than 447 billion yuan; this is three times the purchase and sales amount of the urban-rural materials exchange conference held for 53 days at this time last year.
