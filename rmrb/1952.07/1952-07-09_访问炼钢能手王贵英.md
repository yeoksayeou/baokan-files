    Visiting Steelmaking Expert Wang Guiying
    By Our Reporter Li Yi

    Wang Guiying is a nationally renowned steelmaking expert. He is a resolute and outstanding Communist Party member with burning enthusiasm and extraordinary courage.

    Regarding Wang Guiying's image, people, out of a fervent admiration, often use various illusions to shape everything about him. People often praise Wang Guiying with the most beautiful words. In cities and villages, people spread the story of Chairman Mao's meeting with Wang Guiying in a mythical way, saying that Chairman Mao gave him infinite power when he shook his hand, enabling him to create new steelmaking records one after another. Some say he has a pair of intelligent eyes that can see the temperature of the molten steel without instruments; a glance is enough to distinguish the grade differences of the steel products. Some say Wang Guiying has a pair of extraordinary hands, so much so that the open-hearth furnace is afraid of him, producing good steel.

    Wang Guiying is a famous model worker, who often keeps in mind the three major roles of model workers as instructed by Chairman Mao, and feels that model workers have greater responsibilities than ordinary workers. He said: "My glory is the glory of the Party, the glory of everyone!" Although he was promoted from a shift leader on the open-hearth furnace to the deputy director of the steelmaking department as early as last autumn, he still works on-site with everyone. To improve a technology, he often consults ordinary workers and technicians. He is a steelmaking worker with eleven years of experience. Like all modern industrial workers, he deeply feels that individuals cannot achieve anything if they are separated from the collective. He often says: "A single person cannot build a wall, and a beam cannot be supported without pillars!" This is precisely the expression of the essence of the working class.

    In his personal life, Wang Guiying is extremely simple. His monthly salary is enough for him to eat well. But he doesn't squander it. He often voluntarily lends a considerable amount of money to worker brothers who have more children and are not well-off, or donates it to the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    "Simple life, noble thought." This is the general evaluation of Wang Guiying.

    Wang Guiying is a person with genuine creative enthusiasm, a person who is thoughtful, likes to explore, and is willing to work. Many stories familiar to thousands of workers are enough to illustrate this point. Once, in January of last year, the open-hearth furnace's temperature was too low, and the raw materials would not dissolve. Faced with this situation, some people adopted a waiting attitude, and some simply complained about the insufficient gas supply. Wang Guiying and his fellow workers conducted a detailed inspection and finally found the real reason. Where was the gas insufficient? The gas filled the furnace, the inside of the furnace was dark red, and the pressure was very high, but the chimney damper was only open a small opening of four hundred millimeters. He immediately told his fellow workers to open the chimney damper to seven hundred millimeters. In less than ten minutes, the furnace temperature rose, and the melting accelerated. It turned out that it was not that the gas was insufficient, but that there was too much gas, the pressure was too high, and the chimney's draft could not draw enough gas, so the furnace temperature could not be raised. Wang Guiying's creative labor was most evident in an emergency situation. During the production competition in May of last year, the repair time of the open-hearth furnace greatly exceeded the operating time. Because there were many meetings and many people asked for leave, the manpower was extremely insufficient, so that by May 17th, only 39% of the monthly production task had been completed. The situation was extremely urgent. Wang Guiying returned from a meeting of advanced production team representatives in Taiyuan City and immediately convened a meeting of relevant personnel in the steelmaking department. After careful research, it was found that the main reason was that the open-hearth furnace operators did not pay attention to the gas. In the management of the flue damper, they went to another extreme: the flue damper was opened too much, which reduced the furnace temperature, resulting in a sharp increase in smelting time. The molten steel could not be poured into ingots due to the low temperature, resulting in a large number of scrapped products. Wang Guiying conducted in-depth research, found the cause, and immediately reversed the tense situation, creating two new monthly production records in a row. In the last ten days of May, he quickly completed 50% of the monthly production task and created an unprecedented new monthly production record. Everyone said: "Wang Guiying still has a way." This is sincere and friendly praise, a language from the bottom of the heart.

    I asked Wang Guiying: "What power enables you to turn danger into safety in an emergency and further create new records?" He said: "I am a Communist Party member, and Communist Party members should show their superhuman courage in an emergency. No difficulty exists in front of a Communist Party member." He did not believe that this was due to some personal genius. He said, this "mainly relies on the active study of all fellow workers, and the fellow workers put forward reasonable suggestions. As long as you study, there is no problem that cannot be solved." This is his complete answer to my question. And these few words are his "motto" for creating miracle-like new steelmaking records. Or rather, this is the entire experience of his steelmaking life.

    Time, or temperature (this is a common saying among steelmaking workers), is the most important issue in a steelmaking plant. Time is life. Overcoming time is victory. This is Wang Guiying's most prominent quality. One example is enough to illustrate this point. In February 1951, on a day when the spring breeze was just beginning, the charging machine of the open-hearth furnace unexpectedly broke down and could not load materials. The open-hearth furnace was burning on an empty stomach, and the raging flames were like an infant crying for food. How urgent was time at this moment! Either let the flames burn the furnace wall and cause production to stagnate, causing serious losses to the country; or think of an emergency method to strive to complete the loading of raw materials on time so that production can continue, and then repair the charging machine leisurely. "Not being active is the biggest political mistake." Wang Guiying thought of what the responsible comrades of the Party often warned him, so he immediately mobilized and organized everyone to implement manual loading. He first rushed to the furnace door without regard for his own safety, stood closest to the furnace opening, and used his hands to send the raw materials passed by others into the hungry open-hearth furnace one by one. The flames kept扑向 his side, and his clothes were burned, but he still worked non-stop. At the same time, he said to everyone: "Machines are weapons, and factories are battlefields. Refining one more ton of steel is strengthening the national defense power by one point." The slogan of patriotism greatly encouraged the working enthusiasm of the workers. In the end, they completed the loading work in five minutes less time than the charging machine. The reason for achieving this result is nothing else, but because he and all the workers have superhuman courage. People will always remember that the workers of the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, under the guidance of Wang Guiying's idea of "overcoming time is overcoming everything," created eight new records in a row in seven days before the New Year in 1951. In terms of steelmaking time, they have approached the world standard and are regarded by industrial circles at home and abroad as a symbol of the new China's thriving.

    Wang Guiying has the kind and resolute character of industrial workers. He can live closely and fraternally with all the workers, but he also has clear principles and fighting spirit. Because he has the greatest loyalty to the cause of the Party and the working class, he never relaxes on all principled issues.

    Zhang Tongxi, in his forties, is the foreman of the repair department of the steelmaking department and is the best welder in Taiyuan. However, his temper, style, and life experience are all different from Wang Guiying's. He loves labor and likes to study technology, but his political study is poor, and he unconsciously develops a certain degree of conservative thinking and a purely technical viewpoint. After Wang Guiying, who is younger in age and seniority than him, received the glorious title of model worker, a feeling of jealousy arose in his heart. Once, the opening and closing device of the open-hearth furnace door malfunctioned, and the workers on the open-hearth furnace repaired it for eight hours without success. Wang Guiying rushed over in a hurry to ask Zhang Tongxi for help. Wang Guiying said to Zhang Tongxi: "It hasn't been repaired in eight hours, and production can't be delayed. Please fix it quickly!" Zhang Tongxi agreed without hesitation. But this created an example for him to ridicule Wang Guiying. One day, Zhang Tongxi used this example in the workshop to satirize Wang Guiying to the workers, saying that his technology was inferior. Zhang Tongxi said in a very proud tone of praising his own technology: "?! A model worker! Can't even handle the gate accident. No ability to be a model worker? I don't admire it at all!" Wang Guiying happened to walk to the entrance of the workshop when Zhang Tongxi said this, and clearly heard Zhang Tongxi's words. Wang Guiying was a little angry at the time and once wanted to walk into the workshop to clarify the right and wrong with him, but he suppressed it with the idea of being cautious. He stood next to the open-hearth furnace, pondering for a long time: For the individual, I must clarify the right and wrong; but I am not an ordinary worker, I am a Communist Party member! I should think about the cause of the entire Party and the working class. For the cause of the entire Party and the working class, what does this count for! He looked at the boiling molten steel in the open-hearth furnace and thought of the supreme joy when refining good steel, and he looked far ahead. He further thought about the importance of a Party member and model worker taking the initiative to unite technical personnel and old technicians. At this time, what he mainly thought of was Zhang Tongxi's excellent technology. He abandoned his personal anger and considered winning over Zhang Tongxi. He thought that although Zhang Tongxi has such a bad temper and said a few sarcastic words to himself, he is still a good comrade with a pure heart and actively working. Things really did not go beyond his expectations. After Wang Guiying repeatedly explained to Zhang Tongxi the importance of studying politics for technical personnel and helped him solve many family problems, Zhang Tongxi became enlightened and realized the various mistakes he had made in the past towards Wang Guiying. Now Zhang Tongxi and Wang Guiying are cooperating very well.

    Wang Guiying never relaxes on principled issues at work, even if the problem occurs with his closest fellow workers. Guo Fengshan is a mason in his thirties who usually shares food and clothing with Wang Guiying and is as close as brothers. Once, in April of this year, Guo Fengshan did not get the specifications right when he repaired the gas injection port. Wang Guiying was very anxious when he discovered this situation. This is because, in this year's production, the gas injection port was not repaired according to specifications, which greatly affected the furnace temperature. This is an intolerable error in work. Faced with this fact, Wang Guiying severely criticized Guo Fengshan. He said: "This can't be delivered. You're fooling people!"

    Sincerely cherishing the factory is another essential manifestation of Wang Guiying. He devoted all his energy to his work. He felt that he could not leave the factory at any time. He said: "I feel anxious if I don't see what's going on in the factory for three or two days." The whistle for going to and from work is useless to him. He nominally works eight hours, but in fact, he often works from early morning until midnight. Sometimes he "works against the shift." He is single-mindedly pursuing good steel. He regards his personal gains and losses as extremely small.

    Wang Guiying also has troubles in his heart. But rather than troubles, this is an infinite desire to move forward. After becoming a model worker, he deeply felt the importance of his responsibility. Although he studied in elementary school for four years in his childhood and can now roughly read and write, what he faces is? He urgently needs to study Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's various policies, especially the Party's economic policies; he urgently needs to fully master modern steelmaking technology 100%, greatly improve the country's steel industry in the shortest possible time, and create a large number of steel ingots with better quality. And what is in front of him is that his steelmaking department urgently needs to solve the contradiction of insufficient auxiliary equipment after the production increase. During our conversation, Wang Guiying clearly described this situation several times. He said that the number of open-hearth furnaces has increased, and the output of the open-hearth furnaces has exceeded the output that the Japanese and puppet era thought was fundamentally impossible and unattainable, but its auxiliary equipment, such as high carts and steel juice packages, is still roughly stagnant at the old level. In this way, accidents often occur due to insufficient equipment. He said: "Time is precious!" The cooked steel juice cannot wait for the slow-moving high carts and steel juice packages. What Wang Guiying is troubled by and eager to solve is precisely the problem that the factory and all workers want to solve. Wang Guiying's distress, to a certain extent, reflects the shortcomings in our work of insufficient planning or not solving the problems that have been determined to be solved promptly enough. Of course, this shortcoming is a shortcoming in progress and a temporary phenomenon, and it can be quickly corrected.

    In Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, I personally saw the deeds of thousands of worker brothers working selflessly to increase the country's steel production. From the ever-increasing production index of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, I saw the prospects of our country's industrialization and socialism. Model worker Wang Guiying is the embodiment of the creative power of the great working class on the road to socialism! (Attached picture)

    访问炼钢能手王贵英
    本报记者  李  翼
    王贵英是全国知名的炼钢能手。是一个刚毅的、有着燃烧般的热情和超等勇气的优秀的共产党员。
    对于王贵英的形象，人们由于一种热情的爱慕，常常用种种幻觉来塑造他的一切。人们常常用最美好的词句赞颂王贵英。在城市，在乡村，人们神话般地广泛地传颂着毛主席会见王贵英的情景，说毛主席在和他握手的时候，给了他无穷的力量，使他接二连三地创造了炼钢新纪录。有人说他具有一双聪慧的双眼，不用仪器测量，就可看出钢水的火候；稍一打量，就可以分辨出钢品的等差。有人说王贵英有一双与众不同的手，以致平炉很怕他，把好钢生出来了。
    王贵英是一位有名的劳动模范，他常常念念不忘毛主席所指示的劳动模范的三大作用，感到劳动模范比普通工人有更重大的责任。他说：“我的光荣是党的光荣，是大家的光荣！”他虽然早于去年秋天就由平炉上的一个班长被提升为炼钢部的副主任，但他仍然和大家一起实地做工。为了改进一项技术，他经常去向普通的工人和技师请教。他是一个有十一年工龄的炼钢工人，他和所有近代产业工人一样，深刻地感到：个人离开了集体，是不会有任何作为的。他常说：“单人打不起墙，没柱撑不起梁！”这正是工人阶级本质的表现。
    在私人生活上，王贵英是极为朴素的。一个月的薪资，足够他吃得好好的。可是他不胡吃乱花。他经常把相当多的钱，主动地借给那儿女较多，生活不太宽裕的工人兄弟，或者捐给中国人民志愿军。
    “生活朴素，思想高尚。”这是人们对于王贵英的总评语。
    王贵英是一个有着真正创造热情的人，是一个有思想、好探讨和勇于工作的人。许多为千万个工人所熟知的故事，足以说明这一点。去年一月间，有一次，平炉因温度过低，原料溶解不开。对于这种情况，有的人采取了一种等待的态度，有的人一味埋怨煤气供应不足。王贵英和工友们一道进行了详细的检查，终于找到了真正的原因。那里是煤气不足呢？煤气充满着炉子，炉内呈现着暗红色，压力很大，可是烟囱闸门却仅仅开着四百公厘的小口。他马上叫工友把烟囱闸门开到七百公厘。不到十分钟，炉温升起，熔料加快了。原来并非煤气不够，而是煤气过多，压力太大，而烟囱的引力不能抽足煤气，因而炉温无法提高。王贵英创造性的劳动，在一次紧急的情况中表现得最为明显。去年五月生产竞赛时，平炉修理时间大大地超过了作业时间，由于开会很多，请假的人也多，人力极感不足，以致到了五月十七日，仅完成全月生产任务的百分之三十九。情况至为紧急。王贵英从太原市开完先进生产小组代表会议回来，立刻召集炼钢部有关人员开会，经过缜密的研究，发现主要原因是平炉司炉人不注意煤气，在烟道闸门的管理上，走了另一个极端：烟道闸门开的太大，降低了炉内温度，以致冶炼时间激增，钢水因温度过低而不能注锭，造成大量报废现象。王贵英进行了深入的研究，找出了原因，马上扭转了紧张的局势，接连创造了两个月产新纪录。在五月份最后十天中，迅速地完成了全月生产任务的百分之五十，并创造了空前的月产新纪录。大家都说：“还是王贵英有办法。”这是诚恳而友谊的赞誉，是出自心底的语言。
    我问王贵英：“什么力量使你在紧急的情况下能转危为安，并能进一步创造新纪录呢？”他说：“我是共产党员，共产党员应该在紧急的情况下表现他的超人的勇气。任何困难，在共产党员面前是不存在的。”他不相信这是由于什么个人的天才。他说，这“主要是依靠全体工友同志积极钻研，工友们提出了合理的建议。只要钻研，没有什么解决不了的问题。”这就是他对我发问的全部回答。而这几句话，就是他创造奇迹般的炼钢新纪录的“座右铭”。或者说，这就是他的炼钢生活的全部经验。
    时间，或火候（这是炼钢工人的俗语），在炼钢厂是第一等的问题。时间就是生命。战胜时间就是胜利。这是王贵英最突出的本色、一个事例足以说明这一点，一九五一年二月，一个春风初来的日子，平炉装入机出人意料的发生了故障，不能装料了。平炉空着肚子在燃烧，熊熊的火焰像是一个嗷嗷待哺的幼儿。时间在这当儿是多么紧急啊！要不就是任着火焰将炉壁烧坏，使生产停滞，使国家遭受严重的损失；要不就是想个紧急的办法，争取按时装完原料，使生产得以继续进行，然后再从容地修理装料机。“不积极就是政治上最大的错误。”王贵英想起了党的负责同志所经常告诫他的话，于是，他立刻动员、组织大家，实行人工装料。他首先奋不顾身地冲向炉门，站在炉口的最近处，把别人传递过来的原料，用手一一送进那饥饿的平炉。火焰不断地扑向他的身边，衣服被烧着了，但他仍然不停地工作着。同时并对大家说：“机器就是武器，工厂就是战场。多炼一吨钢，就是增强一分国防力量。”爱国主义的口号，大大地鼓励了工友们的工作情绪。最后，他们用较装料机装料还少五分钟的时间，提前完成了装料工作。获得这种成绩的原因，不是别的，只是由于他和全体工友有着超人的勇气。人们永远记得，太原钢铁厂炼钢部的工友们，在王贵英“战胜时间就是战胜一切”的思想指导下，曾在一九五一年新年以前，在七天的时间里，接连创造了八次新纪录，在炼钢时间上，已经接近了世界标准，被国内外工业界人士看作是新中国蒸蒸日上的一项标志。
    王贵英具有产业工人的善良和刚毅的性格。他能够和全体工友亲密地兄弟般地生活在一起，但他又有明确的原则性和斗争精神。由于他对党和工人阶级事业有着最大的忠心，所以对一切原则性的问题从不放松。
    张桐喜，四十多岁，炼钢部修理部的领班，在焊工方面是全太原的第一手。但是，他的脾气、作风和人生经验，都是和王贵英不同的。他爱劳动，喜欢钻研技术，但他的政治学习较差，不自觉地产生了一定程度的保守思想和单纯技术观点。当着年纪、工龄较他为小的王贵英得到劳动模范的光荣称号之后，他的内心里产生了一种嫉妒的心情。有一次，平炉炉门开闭器发生了故障，平炉上的工友们整整修理了八个小时，还没有修理好。王贵英急如星火地跑去请求张桐喜帮忙。王贵英向张桐喜说：“八小时了还未修好，生产上耽误不起，你赶快修一修吧！”张桐喜毫无异议地答应了。但这却为他造成了一个奚落王贵英的事例。有一天，张桐喜在工房里借着这一事例，向工友们讽刺王贵英，说他的技术是低劣的。张桐喜带着十分自豪的表扬自己的技术的语气说：“?！劳模咧！连闸门事故也处理不了。没能力就当劳模？一点儿不佩服！”张桐喜讲这种话时，王贵英恰巧走到工房门口，清楚地听到了张桐喜的话。王贵英当时有点儿生气，曾一度想走进工房去和他弄清是非，但他为谨慎从事的想法抑住了。他站在平炉旁边，苦思良久：为个人，必须弄清是非；但我不是普通工人，是共产党员啊！我该为整个党和工人阶级的事业着想，为了整个党和工人阶级的事业，这算得了什么！他看着平炉里沸腾的钢水，想到了炼出好钢时无上愉快的情景，他把眼光放远了。他进而想到了一个党员、劳动模范主动团结技术人员和老技工的重要性。这时，他想到的主要是张桐喜的一手漂亮技术。他抛弃了个人的气愤，设想争取张桐喜。他想，张桐喜虽然有着这样不好的脾气，并对自己说了几句讽刺话，但他毕竟是一个心底纯洁并积极工作的好同志。事情果然不出他的预料。当王贵英几次主动地向张桐喜讲解学习政治对于技术人员的重要性，并帮助他解决了不少的家庭问题以后，张桐喜觉悟过来了，他觉察出以前对待王贵英的种种错误。现在张桐喜和王贵英合作得很好。
    王贵英对于工作上的原则问题从不放松，那怕问题发生在他平时最接近的工友身上。郭凤山是一个三十多岁的瓦匠，平时和王贵英一起，衣食不分，亲如兄弟。今年四月间，郭凤山砌修煤气喷出口，有一次没有把规格弄好。王贵英发现了这一情况，焦急万分。这是因为，在今年的生产中，煤气喷出口砌修不合规格，影响炉温甚大。这是不能容忍的工作上的错误。面对着这一事实，王贵英严厉地批评了郭凤山。他说：“这交不了工。是哄人哩！”
    由衷地爱护工厂，这是王贵英的另一本质的表现。他把全部的精力都用在工作上了。他觉得他时刻都不能离开工厂。他说：“三天两天没看到工厂是个啥情况，心里就发急。”上下班的汽笛，对他是无用的。他名义上是做八小时的工，实际上是经常从清晨一直作到夜半。有时是“对头儿转”。他一心追求的是好钢。他把个人的得失看得极为渺小。
    王贵英内心里也有苦恼。但与其说是苦恼，不如说这是无限的前进心。他当了劳动模范，他深深地感到自己责任的重大。他虽然在幼年时代读过四年小学，至今已能粗通文字，但是面临着的是什么呢？是迫切的需要学习马克思列宁主义的理论和党的各项政策，尤其是党的经济政策；是迫切的需要百分之百地完全掌握近代炼钢技术，在最短的时间里，把国家的钢铁工业大大的提高一步，创造大量的品质更为优良的钢锭。而摆在他眼前的，是他的炼钢部迫切地需要解决生产提高后附属设备不足的矛盾。我们谈话时，王贵英几次清楚地描绘了这一情景。他说，平炉增加了，平炉的产量超过了日伪时代认为根本不可能、不可以达到的产量，而它的附属设备如高车、钢汁包等，还大致停滞在旧有的水平上。这样，就常因设备不敷应用而发生事故。他说：“时间是宝贵的呀！”煮熟了的钢汁是等不得跚跚来迟的高车和钢汁包的。王贵英所苦恼而急于要解决的，也正是厂方和全体工人要解决的问题。王贵英的苦闷，在一定程度内反映了我们工作中计划不足或对已经确定要解决的问题解决得不够及时的缺点。当然，这种缺点是进步中的缺点，是暂时的现象，它是可以迅速被改正的。
    在太原钢铁厂，我亲眼看到了千万个工人兄弟为着提高国家的钢铁产量而忘我劳动的事迹。从太原钢铁厂日益增长着的生产指数上，我看到了我们国家工业化和社会主义的远景。劳动模范王贵英就是走向社会主义途中伟大工人阶级创造力量的化身！（附图片）
