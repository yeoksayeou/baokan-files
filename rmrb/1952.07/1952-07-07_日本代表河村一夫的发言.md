Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 4th: Japanese representative Kazuo Kawamura, who attended the special meeting of the World Peace Council, stated during the afternoon session on the 3rd, while discussing the first item on the agenda, "Peaceful Resolution of the German and Japanese Questions," that the Japanese people regard the day the separate peace treaty with Japan and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty came into effect as a day of national humiliation. They have been, and still are, engaged in resolute struggles against the American occupation forces and the Yoshida government. The best proof of this is that the Japanese working people held four unprecedented general strikes in Japanese history between April and June. Kawamura pointed out that the large-scale May Day parade and demonstration in 1952 was the climax of this struggle. On that day, four million workers mobilized and participated in 400 gatherings across the country. In Tokyo, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators bravely repelled the attack of 10,000 soldiers and police, maintaining the integrity of their ranks.

Kawamura then gave a detailed account of the Japanese people's movement to fight for peace and independence, and against the rearmament and national enslavement by the American occupation forces. The number of people who have signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty has reached six million. Speaking of the huge disaster that rearmament has brought to the Japanese economy, he said that 70 percent of Japan's national budget is used for direct and indirect military expenditures, which is extracted from the people's blood through taxation. Japanese youth and women, professors and students, and religious figures have risen up to fight. Farmers and fishermen are fighting against the confiscation of farmland and fishing grounds. Even many capitalists are demanding free trade with the Soviet Union and New China, and opposing the domination of the Japanese economy by the United States. Their enthusiastic support for the Moscow International Economic Conference and the recently signed Sino-Japanese trade agreement is a clear proof of this. Recently, business people in the Kansai region of Japan unanimously expressed their support for the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

Kawamura emphasized that the Japanese people welcome the establishment of People's China and believe that this is a great and historically significant lesson for their own liberation struggle. He pointed out: "The great internationalist spirit of the Chinese people sending their best sons and daughters to help the Korean people and defend Asian peace tells the Japanese people that uniting with the people of all Asian countries, headed by New China, is the path they should take." Kawamura said that the Japanese people have combined their struggle with the peace forces of the world. Marshal Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people this year have greatly encouraged the Japanese people and pointed out a clear path forward for them. Kawamura concluded: "I hope that the World Peace Council will assist in resolving the Japanese question as much as possible, so that the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference can lay the foundation for the great unity of all Asian people in defending peace."

    日本代表河村一夫的发言
    【新华社柏林四日电】出席世界和平理事会特别会议的日本代表河村一夫，在三日下午会议讨论第一项议程“和平解决德国和日本问题”时发言说：日本人民把单独对日和约和日美安全条约生效的日子看作是国耻日。他们曾经而且现在仍在与美国占领军和吉田政府进行坚决斗争，日本劳动人民在四月至六月间举行了日本历史上空前未有的四次总罢工，这就是最好的证明。河村一夫指出：一九五二年五一节举行的大规模游行示威是这个斗争的高潮。在那一天，四百万工人动员起来参加了全国各地的四百处集会。在东京，数十万示威群众奋勇击退了一万名军警的进攻，保持住他们的队伍的完整。
    河村一夫接着详细叙述日本人民争取和平与独立、反对美国占领军进行重新武装和民族奴役的运动。在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名的人数已达六百万人。在谈到重新武装已给日本经济带来巨大灾难时，他说：日本国家预算有百分之七十用作直接军费和间接军费，这是用征税方式榨取人民的血得来的。日本青年和妇女、教授和学生以及宗教界人士已纷纷起来进行斗争。农民和渔民正在为反对没收田地和渔场而奋斗。甚至许多资本家都要求与苏联和新中国进行自由贸易，反对让日本经济受美国支配了。他们热烈支持莫斯科国际经济会议和最近签订的中日贸易协议，就是一个明显的证明。最近，日本关西地方商界人士一致表示支持将要举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    河村一夫强调说：日本人民欢迎人民中国的成立，并且认为这对他们自己的解放斗争是一个伟大的富有历史意义的教训。他指出：“中国人民派他们的最优秀的儿女去帮助朝鲜人民，保卫亚洲和平，这种伟大的国际主义精神告诉日本人民：和以新中国为首的一切亚洲国家人民团结一致是他们应当走的道路。”河村一夫说：日本人民已把他们的斗争和全世界的和平力量结合起来。斯大林大元帅今年给日本人民的新年贺电已大大地鼓舞了日本人民，给他们指出了明确的前进道路。河村一夫最后说：“我希望世界和平理事会尽可能协助解决日本问题，以便让即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议替全亚洲人民保卫和平的伟大团结打下基础。”
