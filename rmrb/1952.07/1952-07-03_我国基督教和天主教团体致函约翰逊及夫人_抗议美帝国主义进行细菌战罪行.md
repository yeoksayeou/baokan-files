Chinese Christian and Catholic Groups Send Letters to Johnson and Wife
Protesting US Imperialist Crimes of Germ Warfare

[Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] Leading figures from various Christian groups, headed by Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Chinese Christianity Against US Aggression and Aid Korea, jointly wrote a letter to the visiting British Archbishop of Canterbury Johnson and his wife, protesting the crimes of germ warfare committed by US imperialism. The full text of the original letter is as follows: Dear Archbishop Johnson and Madam:

We warmly welcome you to New China, because your arrival symbolizes the joint efforts of Christians in our two countries, China and Britain, to defend world peace.

We Chinese Christians want to report to you a recent crime committed by American aggressors that violates humanity and Christian doctrine, that is, the germ warfare they are waging against the Chinese and Korean people. Pastor Wang Zizhong of our Beijing Congregational Church, representing the Chinese religious community, went to Korea and Northeast China and personally saw the various insects carrying bacteria and the shells containing these insects scattered by the US military, and collected a lot of evidence of US germ warfare. Many of our Christian doctors have personally seen the insects and other media spreading bacteria scattered by the American aggressors and have actively participated in the work of defeating American germ warfare. We Chinese Christians believe that the germ warfare waged by American aggressors is absolutely true and undeniable.

Science should be used to heal diseases for people, but American aggressors use science to spread diseases and plagues. American aggressors are doing so many evil deeds, they will surely be punished by God and sanctioned by the people of the world. We would like to ask you to convey our Chinese Christians' solemn protest against American germ warfare to Christians in Britain, the United States, and the world. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of justice, for the sake of world peace, we must call on Christians all over the world to rise up to protest and stop the United States from using bacteriological weapons to massacre Chinese and Korean civilians.

May God be with you and wish you a safe journey!

    抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战罪行
     【新华社二日讯】以中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹委会主席吴耀宗为首的各基督教团体的领导人，联名写信给来我国访问的英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊及夫人，抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。原信全文如下：亲爱的约翰逊教长和夫人：
    我们热烈地欢迎你们到新中国来，因为你们的到来，象征我们中英两国的基督徒为保卫世界和平共同的努力。
    我们中国基督徒要向你们报告一件美国侵略者最近所做的违反人道、违反基督教义的罪行，那就是他们向中朝人民所进行的细菌战争。我们北京公理会的王梓仲牧师代表中国宗教界到了朝鲜与东北各地，亲眼看见了美军撒布的各种带有细菌的昆虫和装置这种昆虫的弹壳，并且搜集了很多美国进行细菌战的证据。我们有不少基督徒医生都亲眼看见了美国侵略军所撒布的传布细菌的昆虫和其他媒介物，并且积极参加了击败美国细菌战的工作。我们中国基督徒认为美国侵略者进行的细菌战是千真万确无可否认的。
    科学应当为人医治疾病，而美国侵略者却用科学来散布疾病和瘟疫，美国侵略者这样作恶多端，一定要受到上帝的责罚与世界人民的制裁。我们要请你们把我们中国基督徒对于美国细菌战的严正抗议，告诉英国、美国和全世界的基督徒。为了人道，为了正义，为了世界和平，我们要呼吁全世界的基督徒都起来抗议并制止美国使用细菌武器来屠杀中朝平民。
    愿上帝与你们同在，并祝你们一路平安！
