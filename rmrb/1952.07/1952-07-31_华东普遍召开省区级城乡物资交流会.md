Following the East China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference, various provinces and regions in East China universally held provincial and regional-level urban-rural material exchange conferences around the summer harvest this year. Except for Southern Jiangsu, which held two such conferences successively, the other five provinces and regions each held one. These exchange activities vigorously supported industrial and agricultural production during the off-season and promoted the early arrival of the peak season. This is another significant victory on the economic front after the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in East China.

Through the exchange conferences in various provinces and regions, the urban-rural relationship in the entire region has become closer. Local exchange conferences have expanded exchanges through various methods such as spot transactions, short-term contracts, barter trade, consignment sales, and joint purchase and sales. With the multifaceted support and assistance of the state-owned economy, the private economy has also begun to actively operate, thus expanding the scope of transactions between public and private entities, as well as among private entities themselves, and increasing transaction volume. According to statistics, the total purchase and sales value of the East China and six provinces and regions' urban-rural material exchange conferences (excluding those below the provincial level) reached 4,777.83 billion yuan, of which native and special products accounted for more than 60%. After these exchange activities, the sales channels for major native and special products in various regions have been basically opened up. Most of them have shifted from being unsalable to marketable, and from marketable to readily marketable. For example, the total value of accumulated native and special products in Fujian Province in the first half of the year was about 200 billion yuan. After selling 170 billion yuan at the East China Material Exchange Conference in early June and more than 40 billion yuan in domestic exchanges, the sales problem has been solved. The total value of bulk native and special products that Northern Jiangsu urgently needed to sell was more than 110 billion yuan. After exchanging 70 billion yuan in East China and provincial exchanges, the rest were also sold successively in participating in inter-regional exchange conferences. This spring, 56 kinds of native and special products were unsalable in Anhui, but now most of them have found sales channels.

Native and special products are an important part of the rural commodity economy. After selling native and special products, farmers buy a large number of industrial products and means of production. Therefore, they have played a significant role in maintaining normal production in urban industries during the off-season. Since June, the situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai has generally exceeded the level before the "Five-Anti" movement. The industrial turnover in June increased by 10% compared with May and more than 20% compared with the same period last year. Industry and commerce are now further improving. After the summer harvest, the demand for industrial products by farmers continues to increase. At the recent material exchange conferences in Fujian and Southern Jiangsu, the proportion of industrial products in the total purchase and sales value has risen to 42% and 46%. This trend fully demonstrates that urban industry and commerce will rapidly prosper.

At present, the urban-rural exchange activities in East China are being further promoted to counties, cities, and even central market towns (districts). More than 100 counties and cities and several central market towns in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Southern Jiangsu provinces have held exchange conferences. Danyang County in Southern Jiangsu and several counties in Zhejiang have created important experiences in holding good exchange conferences at the county or district level. In addition to solving the sales channels of small-scale native products through short-distance exchanges, these exchange conferences have also organized the distribution of industrial products to rural areas, which has provided good conditions for meeting farmers' needs for industrial products after the autumn harvest. However, up to now, some areas are still stuck in the large-scale exchanges at the provincial and regional levels in urban-rural material exchanges. For example, the near-distance exchanges at the county and district levels in Shandong have not been universally carried out. This situation of "flowing upstream but not downstream" needs to be corrected quickly.

### 华东普遍召开省区级城乡物资交流会

    华东普遍召开省区级城乡物资交流会
    今年夏收前后，华东各省区为活跃城乡经济，继华东区城乡物资交流大会后，普遍举行了省区一级的城乡物资交流大会，除苏南先后举行两次外，其他五省区各开一次。这些交流活动，有力地扶持了淡季中的工农业生产，并促使旺季的提前到来；这是华东区“三反”“五反”运动胜利后，在经济战线上的又一重大胜利。
    通过各省区的交流会议，全区城乡关系趋于密切，各地交流会曾以现货交易、短期合同、易货交易、委托代销及联购联销等多种方式扩大了交流。私营经济在国营经济的多方扶植与帮助下，也开始积极经营，因而公私、私私之间的交易面扩大，成交量增加。据统计：华东及六省区城乡物资交流大会（省以下未计）的购销总值共达四万七千七百八十三亿元，其中土特产的比重在百分之六十以上。经过这些交流活动，各地大宗土特产已基本上打开销路，大部分已由滞销而行销，由行销而畅销。如福建全省上半年积压土特产约值二千多亿元，六月初在华东区物资交流大会上推销一千七百余亿元及省内交流四百余亿元后，销路已经解决。苏北亟须推销的大宗土特产，总值一千一百余亿元，在华东及省内交流七百余亿元后，其余的也在参加外区交流会中陆续销出。安徽今春有五十六种土特产滞销，现大部分也已有了销路。
    土特产是农村商品经济中的重要部分之一，农民卖出土特产后，便大量购买工业品和生产资料，因而，对维持城市工业的淡季正常生产起了很大的作用。上海自六月份起，工商业情况，一般都已超过了“五反”运动前的水平，工业营业额，六月较五月增加一成，较去年同期增加二成以上，工商业现正进一步好转中。夏收以后，农民对工业品的需要量继续增加，最近举行的福建、苏南物资交流大会，工业品占购销总值的比重已上升到百分之四十二和四十六。这个趋势，充分显示了城市工商业将迅速繁荣。
    目前，华东区的城乡交流活动正深入一步推到县市以至中心集镇（区）去。浙江、安徽、苏南等省区已有一百个以上县市和若干中心集镇举行过交流会，苏南丹阳县和浙江若干县，在开好县或区两级交流会上，已创造了重要经验。这些交流会，除了通过短距离交流解决小宗土产的销路外，并组织了工业品下乡，这对秋后满足农民对工业品的需要，已具备了良好的条件。但到现在为止，部分地区在城乡物资交流中还停留在省区的大交流上。例如山东县、区两级的近距离交流尚未普遍进行，这种“上流下不流”的情况，需要迅速纠正。
