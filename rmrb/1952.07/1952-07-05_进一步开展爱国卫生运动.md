    Further Develop the Patriotic Health Campaign
    The health work of New China is an important part of the people's public health work. It is of paramount importance to promoting people's health and strengthening national construction. Therefore, the health campaign is not only seasonal but also regular. For three years, under the leadership of relevant departments of the people's governments at all levels, adopting the policy of popularization and prevention first, health organizations have been widely established throughout the country, epidemic diseases have been prevented in a timely manner, and treatment of epidemic diseases has been strengthened, thus making the health work of New China has achieved great achievements, greatly improving the people's health level. This great victory on the health work front has guaranteed the smooth progress of our country's production increase and frugality campaign and national construction undertakings. It shows the Communist Party and the People's Government's deep concern and extreme importance to the people's lives and health, It shows that New China has sufficient strength and confidence to gradually liberate the people from the suffering of diseases, and it also shows the superiority of the new democratic social system.
    With the continuous improvement of the people's political consciousness and their increasing awareness of the importance of hygiene, the scale of the patriotic health campaign is constantly expanding. Since the beginning of spring this year, millions of people have invested in this patriotic movement, and the environmental and personal hygiene conditions have been unprecedentedly improved. We have carried out preventive vaccinations throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people vaccinated has reached more than a quarter of the total population of the country. Factories, government agencies, schools, troops, and the vast rural areas have carried out clean-up campaigns, cleared garbage and debris, cleaned up and built sewers, improved and built toilets, filled in sewage pits, dredged ditches, improved water sources, and universally carried out the extermination of vector animals. A large number of flies have been exterminated in various places, and millions of mice have been killed. Major cities have strengthened the management of vendors, most of the open-air food stalls have been banned, and other food vendors have also set up fly-proof devices such as gauze covers or glass covers, and the shop assistants have put on white work clothes. Cities such as Beijing, Qingdao, Dalian, and Shenyang have made significant achievements in sanitary and epidemic prevention work. The perennial "garbage mountain" in the Nan'an District and Tiexi District of Shenyang City has been rebuilt into a clean and beautiful square, and a muddy street in the Shenhe District has been renovated into a flat road. In addition, for example, the Qinhuangdao Municipal People's Government led the people of the city to fill in a stinky ditch about 2,300 meters long surrounding the urban area in twenty-one days. Such examples are too numerous to mention. People in various places spontaneously organized patriotic health mutual aid groups, supervised and inspected each other, carried out hygiene work, and began to develop good hygiene habits.
    The reason why the patriotic health campaign can achieve such great results nationwide is first and foremost due to the importance attached to it by the people's governments at all levels. They organized forces to conduct extensive publicity and mobilization to the masses, such as organizing medical personnel and scientific workers to publicize relevant hygiene knowledge to the masses; printing and distributing various written and pictorial propaganda materials; holding hygiene lectures; and holding small-scale patriotic hygiene exhibitions. In rural areas, propaganda was also carried out to the peasant masses by means of market fairs. In this way, the broad masses were mobilized to participate in hygiene work, forming a powerful people's anti-epidemic front and strengthening the anti-epidemic organizations at all levels. The broad masses of medical and scientific workers have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in their work. Many people have worked day and night to rush to produce large quantities of vaccines, ensuring the victorious completion of the injection task. Many medical hygiene experts have strongly assisted in the anti-epidemic training work, making tens of thousands of young men and women strong fighters on the anti-epidemic front.
    In order to further develop the patriotic health campaign on the existing basis, it is first necessary to correct the wrong ideas of the leading cadres of some units. A small number of leaders still lack sufficient understanding of the patriotic health campaign, are paralyzed and careless, and adopt a nonchalant attitude towards this work, and have not done a good job in mobilizing the masses to participate in this movement. Some people think that hygiene work is only a matter for hygiene personnel, which affects the widespread development of hygiene work. Some people lack a long-term view and regard hygiene work as a temporary task. They think that "when the wave passes, everything will be fine." These harmful ideas must be resolutely overcome.
    The patriotic health campaign must become a mass movement with leadership. Widely and deeply mobilizing and organizing the masses is an important key to carrying out this movement on a large scale. We should, in light of the ideological conditions of the masses, use various forms such as newspapers, periodicals, radio broadcasts, slides, seminars, and small-scale exhibitions to repeatedly publicize hygiene work to workers, peasants, and urban residents, so that everyone realizes that hygiene work is a powerful guarantee for safeguarding the people's health and victoriously carrying out the patriotic production increase movement.
    At the same time, the patriotic health work must be closely integrated with production. We must oppose the tendency to only pay attention to production and neglect hygiene work. Some people think that the hygiene movement "will hinder the production increase competition movement" and "will hinder the patriotic bumper harvest movement," pitting hygiene work against production. They have not realized that the purpose of carrying out the hygiene movement is to ensure the smooth development of the production increase and frugality movement. If the health of the workers and peasants is not improved, the development of production and construction will inevitably be affected. The Shanhai Pass Locomotive Depot of the Ministry of Railways, in the patriotic hygiene movement, combined production and put forward the slogan "Machines take baths, waste iron turns over," as a result, not only was the accumulated waste removed, but also more than 100 kilograms of usable waste copper were picked up. Workers said: "Environmental hygiene is done well, and the number of sick workers has decreased." "The machine cleaning system has been established, sand cannot enter, efficiency has been improved, lathe wear has been reduced, and the life of the machine has been extended." For example, before carrying out environmental hygiene work in Huaide County, Jilin Province, the area of cultivated land fertilized only reached 40%; after carrying out environmental hygiene work, the amount of fertilizer increased, making the number of fertilization reach 100%. These concrete examples show that hygiene work not only does not affect production work, but on the contrary improves production efficiency.
    The patriotic health campaign is a major political task. At a time when the American aggressors are disregarding international bans and waging germ warfare against Korea and our country, it is even more necessary for us to further develop the patriotic health campaign in order to victoriously carry out the struggle against germ warfare. Leading comrades at all levels must take the lead and act actively. Medical and health workers and medical experts should give full play to their creative talents and serve the health of the broad masses of people and the production and construction of the motherland.

### 进一步开展爱国卫生运动

    进一步开展爱国卫生运动
    新中国的卫生工作是人民大众的保健工作的重要部分。它对于增进人民健康和加强国家建设的力量，有头等重要的意义。因此，卫生运动不仅具有季节性，而且具有经常性。三年以来，在各级人民政府有关部门的领导下，采取普及和预防为主的方针，在全国各地普遍建立卫生组织，及时预防疫病的发生，并加强对疫病的治疗，因而使新中国的卫生工作获得了巨大的成就，大大地提高了人民的健康水平。这个卫生工作战线上的巨大胜利，保证了我国增产节约运动和国家建设事业的顺利进行。它说明了共产党和人民政府对人民生命健康的深切关怀和极端重视，说明了新中国有足够的力量和信心来逐步使人民摆脱疾病的痛苦，也说明了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。
    随着人民群众政治觉悟的不断提高，随着他们对卫生的重要性的认识不断提高，爱国卫生运动的规模正在不断地扩大着。今年入春以来，千百万人民投入了这个爱国主义的运动，使环境卫生和个人卫生状况得到了空前的改进。我们在全国范围内进行了预防接种。据不完全的统计，受到预防接种的人数已达全国总人口的四分之一以上。各地工厂、机关、学校、部队和广大的农村，都进行了清洁卫生运动，清除了垃圾和杂物，清理和修建了下水道，改良和修建了厕所，填平了污水坑，疏通了沟渠，改良了水源，普遍进行了扑灭传染病的媒介动物。各地扑灭了大量苍蝇，捕杀数百万只老鼠。各大城市加强了对摊贩的管理工作，露天饮食摊贩大部已予取缔，其他食品摊贩也都设置了防蝇器如纱布罩或玻璃罩，店员们都穿上了白色工作服。北京、青岛、大连、沈阳等城市在卫生防疫工作上都有显著的成绩。沈阳市南市区和铁西区陈年的“垃圾山”已改建为整洁美观的广场，沈河区一条原是泥泞的街道已翻修成为平坦的马路。此外，如秦皇岛市人民政府领导全市人民在二十一天中填平了环绕着市区的长约二千三百公尺的臭水沟。这一类例子，不胜枚举。各地群众自动地组织爱国卫生互助组，互相督促检查，进行卫生工作，开始养成良好的卫生习惯。
    爱国卫生运动所以能在全国范围内获得这样巨大的成绩，首先是由于各级人民政府的重视。它们组织力量向群众广泛地进行了宣传动员，如组织医务人员和科学工作者，向群众进行了有关卫生知识的宣传；印发了各种文字和图画的宣传品；举行了卫生讲座；举办了小型的爱国卫生展览会。在农村中，也利用集市向农民群众进行了宣传。这样就发动了广大的群众参加卫生工作，形成了一个强大的人民防疫战线，加强了各级防疫组织。广大的医务科学工作者在工作中发挥了高度的积极性，不少人日以继夜地赶制大批疫苗，保证了注射任务的胜利完成。许多医学卫生专家，大力协助了防疫训练工作，使成千成万的男女青年成为防疫战线上的坚强战士。
    为了在现有基础上更进一步地开展爱国卫生运动，首先必须纠正某些单位的领导干部的错误思想。少数领导人对爱国卫生运动还缺乏足够的认识，麻痹大意，对这一工作采取满不在乎的态度，没有很好地发动群众参加这一运动。有的认为卫生工作仅仅是卫生人员的事情，影响了卫生工作的普遍开展。有的缺乏长期打算的观点，把卫生工作当作临时任务，他们以为“浪头一过，万事大吉”。这些有害的思想必须坚决地加以克服。
    爱国卫生运动必须成为有领导的群众运动。广泛深入地动员和组织群众，是大规模地开展这一运动的重要关键。应该针对群众的思想情况，利用各种各样的形式如报纸、刊物、广播、幻灯、座谈，以及小型展览会等，向工人、农民、市民反复进行卫生工作的宣传，使个个人认识到卫生工作是保障人民身体健康、胜利开展爱国增产运动的有力保证。
    同时爱国卫生工作，必须和生产紧密地结合起来，我们必须反对光是注意生产，而忽视卫生工作的偏向。有人认为：卫生运动“会妨碍增产竞赛运动”，“会妨碍爱国丰产运动”，把卫生工作和生产对立起来。他们没有认识到开展卫生运动的目的，就是为了保证增产节约运动的顺利开展。如果不提高工农劳动人民的健康，生产建设事业的发展必然会受到影响。铁道部山海关机务段，在爱国卫生运动中结合生产提出了“机器都洗澡，废铁大翻身”的口号，结果不但清除了堆积的废物，还捡出了一百多斤可以利用的废铜。工人说：“环境卫生作得好，工友得病的减少了。”“订立了机器清扫制度，砂子进不去，效率提高了，车床磨耗降低，机器寿命还延长了。”又如吉林省怀德县在进行环境卫生工作之前，耕地上粪面积只达百分之四十；而在开展环境卫生工作以后，增加了肥料，使上粪数达到百分之百。这些具体例子说明了卫生工作不但不会影响生产工作，相反地提高了生产效率。
    爱国卫生运动是一个重大的政治任务。在美国侵略者正不顾国际的禁令，向朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的时候，我们更有必要进一步开展爱国卫生运动，以便胜利地进行反细菌战的斗争。各级领导同志必须以身作则，积极地行动起来。医务卫生工作者们和医学专家们，应该尽量发挥自己的创造才能，为广大人民的健康和祖国的生产建设服务。
