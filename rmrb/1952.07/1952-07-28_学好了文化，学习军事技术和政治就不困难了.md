    "Once You've Mastered Culture, It Won't Be Difficult to Learn Military Technology and Politics"
    Editor: Since the promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method," a vigorous cultural learning movement has unfolded within the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I am now telling you about a very small incident, from which one can see the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning culture.
    On July 7th, I went to the Ninth Company of a certain unit. As soon as I entered the courtyard, several comrades rushed to tell me about their reading: Comrade Li Xi read three pamphlets in one morning, Comrade Bu Chaozhi finished reading the 47,000-word "Sons and Daughters of China and Korea,"...
    At this moment, Instructor Yan came over carrying a large, full book bag. Many comrades surrounded him, exchanging books with him. I went to the instructor's room, where many comrades surrounded Instructor Meng's large bookcase, selecting the books they wanted to read. Instructor Yan described to me the soldiers' avid reading: Comrade Han Kui read 136,000 words in 23 hours, and Comrade Chen Jianxiu read 140,000 words. Finally, he said, "These are just the statistics from last Friday; there are even more today!"
    During nap time, I walked around the company and found that every soldier had one or two books placed next to their pillow. Messenger Xiao Du was not yet asleep. As soon as he saw me, he told me about his reading. Finally, he said:
    "We can't relax; we're still far behind! Once you've mastered culture, it won't be difficult to learn military technology and politics."
    I said, "Now that you've mastered culture, you should write a letter to your family in your own handwriting!"
    "Not yet!" he said. "I have to write a letter to Chairman Mao first. Chairman Mao will definitely be happy when he sees the letters we wrote in our own handwriting!"

    “学好了文化，学习军事技术和政治就不困难了”
    编辑同志：“速成识字法”推广以后，中国人民解放军内展开了轰轰烈烈的文化学习运动。我现在告诉你一段很小的事情，从这里可以看出战士们学习文化的热烈情况。
    七月七日，我到某部九连去。一进院子，好几个同志争着对我说读书的事：李喜同志一上午念了三本小册子，卜朝之同志念完了有四万七千多字的
    “中朝儿女”，……。
    这时候，阎教员背着一个装得满满的大书包走过来。好多同志围上去，向他换书。我走到教员室，好多同志围着孟教员身旁的大书箱，挑选自己想读的书。阎教员向我叙述了战士们如饥似渴地看书的情况：韩魁同志在二十三小时内读了十三万六千字，陈建秀同志读了十四万字。最后，他说：“这还是上星期五的统计数字，到今天更多了！”
    午睡时间，我到班里转了一圈，发现每个战士的枕头旁都放着一两本书。通讯员小杜还没睡着。他一见我，就把他读书的情况告诉我。最后，他说：
    “可不能松劲，还差得远呢！学好了文化，学习军事技术和政治就不困难了。”
    我说：“你学好了文化，该亲笔给家里写封信了！”
    “不忙！”他说：“得先给毛主席写封信。毛主席看见了咱们亲笔写的信，一定要高兴呢！”
