Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 15th: Following the bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant, the American invading bandits, on the anniversary of the Korean armistice negotiations, carried out a large-scale bombing of Pyongyang city. From 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on July 11th, more than 400 American aircraft continuously and indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang city and its suburbs, dropping more than 6,000 bombs, incendiary bombs, and time bombs, killing and wounding over 1,000 peaceful residents. From 10:00 PM that night to 3:30 AM on the morning of the 12th, more than 50 American B-29 bombers again indiscriminately bombed the residential areas of Pyongyang city and its suburbs. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 more civilians were killed, 4,126 were wounded, and another 784 were missing. More than 2,700 civilian houses in the city were destroyed. In the western district of Pyongyang, almost all civilian houses in Renxing No. 1, 2, and 3, Kanxing No. 1 and 3, and Shangxing, the central district of Xicheng No. 3, Dataeling No. 2, and Tangshang No. 1 in the southern district were destroyed. The markets, hospitals and schools in the city were also cruelly destroyed. The American aerial bandits particularly viciously bombed the most densely populated residential area in the western district of Pyongyang, dropping 1,159 bombs in the western district alone. As of the afternoon of the 12th, 1,182 male and female corpses had been unearthed in the district, of which 771 were women and children.

The warriors of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of our army fiercely attacked the American aerial bandits who indiscriminately bombed the Pyongyang area. On the 11th, a total of 10 American planes were shot down and 7 were damaged.

The people of the heroic city of Pyongyang, suffering the largest planned bombing in nearly a year, once again demonstrated the unparalleled heroic and indomitable spirit of the Korean people. All medical workers and people from all walks of life, disregarding the American planes' frenzied bombing, strafing, and the explosion of time bombs, mobilized day and night to rescue the wounded, resettle refugees, and dig out corpses, and filled the bomb craters in the city's main streets in a short period of time. The work of digging out corpses is still continuing. The people of Pyongyang are responding to the shameful atrocities of the defeated American aggressors with intense work.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: TASS, Pyongyang, July 15th: The American jet fighter attack on Pyongyang during the day on July 11th, as well as the Flying Fortress night attacks, were the most barbaric attacks Pyongyang has suffered since the beginning of the war.

In the eastern part of Pyongyang, ten schools were destroyed by bombing. During the daytime air raid, approximately one hundred and ten elementary school students were killed or injured. In addition, many people were killed or injured as a result of American planes bombing and strafing hospitals, clinics, and medical stations. Among the destroyed buildings were not only medical institutions and schools, but also Pyongyang's theaters and other cultural institutions. These facts demonstrate that the main purpose of this indiscriminate bombing is to eliminate civilians, because there are no military targets whatsoever in Pyongyang.

    美机七月十一日滥炸平壤市区及郊区经过
    【新华社平壤十五日电】美国侵略强盗继轰炸鸭绿江发电厂之后，又在朝鲜停战谈判一周年的时候对平壤市区进行了大规模的轰炸。十一日上午十时到下午六时，美机四百多架连续狂轰滥炸平壤市区及郊区一带，投下了六千余颗炸弹、烧夷弹与定时炸弹，杀死杀伤了和平居民一千余人。当天晚上十时到十二日晨三时半，美国（B）二十九型轰炸机五十多架又滥炸平壤市区及郊区的居民聚集地带。据不完全的统计，又有市民两千多人被杀死，四千一百二十六人被杀伤，另有七百八十四人情况不明。市区民房被毁的有两千七百多所，平壤市西区的仁兴一里、二里、三里，坎兴一里、三里与上兴里中区的西城三里，大驼岭二里，南区的堂上一里等地民房几乎全部被毁，市内的市场与医院学校也遭到了残酷的破坏。美国空中强盗特别凶恶地轰炸了居民最集中的平壤市西区，仅在西区一地就投弹一千一百五十九枚。到十二日下午为止，该区已掘出男女尸体一千一百八十二具，其中有七百七十一人是妇女与儿童。
    我军高射炮部队某部勇士们痛击滥炸平壤地区的美国空中强盗。十一日共击落美机十架，击伤七架。
    英雄城平壤市的人民在遭受近一年来最大一次有计划的轰炸的时候，再一次表现了朝鲜人民无比英勇与不可屈服的伟大精神。全体医务工作者与各界人民都不顾美机的疯狂轰炸扫射与定时炸弹的爆炸，昼夜出动抢救伤员，安置难民，挖掘死尸，并在短期内填好了市内各主要街道的弹坑。挖掘尸体的工作现仍在继续进行中。平壤市人民正以紧张的工作回答着业已遭受失败的美国侵略者的可耻暴行。
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社平壤十五日讯：美国喷气战斗机在七月十一日白天对平壤的袭击以及飞行堡垒夜间的袭击，是战争开始以来平壤所受到的最野蛮的袭击。
    在平壤市东部有十所学校被炸毁，在白天的空袭期间，约有一百一十名小学生被炸死或炸伤。此外，由于美机轰炸和扫射医院、诊疗所和医疗站，还死伤了很多人。在被炸毁的建筑中不仅有医疗机关和学校，而且还有平壤的剧院和其他文化机关。这些事实说明了这种狂轰滥炸的最主要的目的就是消灭平民，因为平壤根本没有任何军事目标。
