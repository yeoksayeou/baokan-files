　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 28th: The nationwide steelworkers' strike in the United States, which lasted for 54 days, ended on the 25th after achieving partial victory. The United Steelworkers of America (CIO) union president Murray and the general manager of "U.S. Steel Corporation," Fairless, representing the six major steel companies in the United States, reached an agreement on wage issues on the 24th under the personal supervision of President Truman. The steelworkers resumed work that evening. The long struggle waged by the American steelworkers forced the capitalists to make some concessions in the end. However, due to the interference of the Truman government and the compromise policy of right-wing union leaders, these concessions by the steel companies are far from meeting the demands of the workers. The agreement between the union and the capitalists stipulates that steelworkers' hourly wages will be increased by 16 cents, and extra subsidies will be increased by 5 cents per hour, starting from March 1st. The workers originally demanded a wage increase of 26 cents per hour, starting from January 1st. To increase wages, steel company capitalists were also allowed to raise steel prices by $5.20 per ton. According to American newspapers, the price increase caused by the rise in steel prices will offset the benefits gained by the workers.

　　Although this strike did not achieve complete victory, it has demonstrated the magnificent power of the American workers. American newspapers call this strike "the longest and most expensive steel strike in American history." As of the 25th, American steel production had lost 17 million tons. After resuming work, it will take another week to two weeks to fully restore production after the blast furnaces are lit and the equipment is repaired. Therefore, the total loss of steel is about 20 million tons.

　　The stagnation of steel production not only caused the reduction and shutdown of many industrial sectors in the United States, but also seriously hit American arms production. The day before the steel union and the capitalists reached an agreement, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett admitted at a press conference that the situation was "very serious." He said: "Arms production has begun to tend towards stagnation. ... This is a major disaster, and we must not take it lightly." Lovett mentioned that General Clark, commander-in-chief of the U.S. invading army in Korea, had sent a telegram "expressing his concern about the impact of the steel strike." Lovett also mentioned that the strike had shut down 54 factories working for the Navy and severely delayed the production of 422 parts needed to manufacture F-86 jet aircraft. The largest shell manufacturing plant of the Army in St. Louis was also shut down due to a lack of steel. According to Lovett's estimate, the loss in arms production caused by the steel strike is valued between 2.5 billion and 5 billion U.S. dollars, and this year's U.S. arms production will be reduced by 20% to 30%.

    美钢铁罢工结束
    【新华社二十八日讯】华盛顿消息：坚持达五十四天的美国全国钢铁工人大罢工，已在取得部分胜利后于二十五日宣告结束。举行罢工的联合钢铁工人工会主席莫莱和美国六大钢铁公司代表“美国钢铁公司”总经理费尔勒斯，二十四日在总统杜鲁门的亲自监督下就工资问题达成协议。钢铁工人已于当晚复工。美国钢铁工人所进行的长期斗争，迫使资方终于不得不作若干让步。但是，由于杜鲁门政府的干涉和右翼工会领袖的妥协政策，钢铁公司的这些让步还远不能满足工人们的要求。工会和资方的协议中规定：钢铁工人每小时工资增加美金一角六分，额外津贴每小时增加五分，从三月一日算起。而工人原来的要求是每小时增加工资二角六分，从一月一日算起。为了增加工资，钢铁公司资方同时还获准把钢铁价格每吨提高五元二角。据美国报纸说，由于钢铁涨价而引起的物价上涨将使工人得到的利益为之抵消。
    虽然这次罢工并没有获得完全的胜利，但是它已显示了美国工人雄伟的力量。美国报纸把这次罢工叫做“美国历史上历时最久花钱最大的一次钢铁罢工”。截至二十五日为止，美国钢铁生产已损失一千七百万吨。复工以后，还要一个星期到两个星期的时间等鼓风炉生火和设备修整以后才能完全恢复生产。因此，全部损失的钢铁达两千万吨左右。
    钢铁生产的停顿不但造成了美国许多工业部门的减产和停闭，而且使美国军火生产受到了严重的打击。在钢铁工会和资方达成协议的前一天，美国国防部长罗维特曾在记者招待会上承认局势“非常严重”。他说：“军火生产已开始趋于停顿。……这是一个大灾难，我们决不能等闲视之。”罗维特谈到美国侵朝军总司令克拉克曾来电“对钢铁罢工的影响表示忧惧”。罗维特又谈到：罢工已使为海军工作的五十四个工厂停闭，并且严重地延滞了制造F八十六式喷气机所需要的四百二十二项零件的生产。在圣路易的陆军最大的炮弹制造厂也因缺乏钢铁而停工。据罗维特估计，由于钢铁罢工引起的军火生产方面的损失，总值在二十五亿到五十亿美元之间，今年的美国军火生产将减低百分之二十至三十。
