People Forever Advancing in Joyful Tension
——On the Cultural and Sports Activities of a Certain Regiment of the People's Liberation Army
Wu Ming
In June, as a tropical rainstorm advanced towards Guangzhou Bay, I arrived at a village near Guangzhou. These past few days, the wind and rain brought by the storm have made the subtropical heat feel somewhat like the rainy season of early autumn. But it was this cool and pleasant weather that allowed me to fully visit and observe an ordinary infantry regiment.

It was a cloudy morning when the car, following the winding yellow sand road, led us to the regiment's station. The village was surrounded by bushes, and a winding river flowed by its side, truly an exceptionally beautiful place. Entering the village, the people in the car pointed and exclaimed, "Look at how clean and comfortable our soldiers have made their station!" As soon as we got out of the car, what first drew our attention was the company club next to the clear pond. Many people were going in and out, and I followed the crowd inside. The comrade in charge of the company club warmly pointed out and introduced everything to us. The comrade in charge of the library told me that the hundreds of books on the shelves were no longer enough to meet the needs of the soldiers since the unit eliminated illiteracy using the quick literacy method in March. Therefore, they had to borrow dozens of books from the regimental library every week. Currently, everyone in the company enjoys reading. Following his finger, I saw another manifestation of the soldiers' improved cultural level: all kinds of manuscripts filled the bulletin boards. I casually read a few, and the soldiers had moved beyond simple praise, writing more about their experiences, feelings, and introductions of experience on specific matters. They were written in a simple and vivid manner. Moreover, there were often one or two hundred such manuscripts every day, and at least thirty or so were maintained daily. From this, one can also see the soldiers' interest in writing after becoming literate. The club also had a music room, filled with a dozen instruments, and the walls were covered with sheet music. A soldier excitedly told me that their violin player had never even touched a violin before, but after practicing for a month, he was able to perform on stage and accompany their dances. As he spoke, he was about to perform for us. In another room was their creative exhibition, with photos of self-composed and self-performed dances, and small plays and comic dialogues that had received awards. Most eye-catching was the large room in the center—the "Maintain Glory" room, surrounded by various banners and commendation orders. Some of these banners were awarded by higher authorities, some were presented by the people, and some were won in competitions. Each banner represented a glorious period in their history. The most prominent was the "Three Good Company" award banner. Originally, this company had outstanding achievements in combat, unity, and mass work during the southward march, and was therefore praised by higher authorities as the "Three Good Company." As the soldiers humbly explained to me, I felt admiration for their preservation and promotion of these honors.

The arrangement of this club met the actual needs of the soldiers, so the soldiers loved it as much as they loved their classrooms and playgrounds. During their spare time, the soldiers read books, newspapers, played music, played ping-pong, read the bulletin boards, or gathered in circles to debate some issue... The soldiers meaningfully told us, "Once you enter the club, you don't want to leave, and even when you leave, you turn back to look at it a few more times."

In the afternoon, we learned that it was not just this company that had such a club, and it was not the most outstanding in the entire regiment. Every company had a club that the soldiers loved and a sound club organization.

We saw firsthand that dancing was not only loved by the soldiers, but they were also able to create many new dances combining their thoughts, feelings, and real-life experiences. In March, the First Company created the "Cookhouse Dance," which toured various field units in South China for more than a month, earning praise from higher authorities and comrades. Now, 70% to 90% of the entire regiment can do several movements of the "Red Army Dance," as well as the "Unity Dance" and "Duet Dance." They have successively created more than twenty dances. The First Company is a company where dance has developed best. Following the "Cookhouse Dance," they recently created a "Air Defense Dance" with strong ideological content and considerable artistic merit, which is very popular among the soldiers. The comrades of the First Company also told us the following story:

When dancing was initially being developed, everyone in the company welcomed it, except for the old cook squad leader, who was unwilling to participate. Every day during recreation, everyone was dancing heartily on the playground, but the old cook squad leader stayed at home. One day, several young soldiers whispered and decided to go back and mobilize the old cook squad leader. But when they returned, they found the old cook squad leader alone in the room, not knowing what he was doing. Everyone secretly took a look, oh! It turned out that the old squad leader was seriously practicing the basic movements of the dance, stretching his legs and bending his waist. The room was stuffy, and the old squad leader was covered in sweat. Everyone burst into laughter and rushed in. The old squad leader was flushed with shame, but from then on, he never stayed at home during recreation again.

Now, from the regimental commander and political commissar to the cooks and feeders, everyone dances together without any restraint. During breaks, they can dance in groups of three or five anytime, anywhere. Even during breaks on forced marches, they can play the harmonica and clap their hands, singing and dancing.

The soldiers greatly enjoy various ball games, especially basketball, which is a sport widely participated in by the soldiers. The regiment has a team, the battalion has a team, the company has a team, and even each platoon has its own players. They often compete with each other. This day, we watched several company soldier team matches. Not only was the technique quite good and the rules strict, but they were also very serious and courteous. Even the local people reflected, "The People's Liberation Army is polite even when playing, this unit is really civilized."

Other aspects of the regiment's cultural and sports activities are also very common. Here, I will introduce some figures: In addition to the basketball mentioned above, there are currently twenty-one volleyball teams, seven baseball teams, and other organizations and equipment for group calisthenics, apparatus exercises, track and field, table tennis, and badminton. The entire regiment has more than 160 various musical instruments such as violins, erhus, qinqins, and flutes. In addition, there is a large harmonica team of over a hundred people. Each battalion has an amateur band, and each company has an instrumental music group and a set of percussion instruments. Recently, higher authorities also donated four accordions to his regiment. These instruments have all been mastered by the soldiers, and they can be played solo, coordinated with dance, or used to accompany singing. The soldiers love music so much that some soldiers carried their erhu from the Northeast to the Guanzhong area. For several years, it has followed him in marching and fighting, trekking through thousands of mountains and rivers. The soldiers said that it (the instrument) has also made contributions to enlivening the unit. Now, each company has several people who can conduct, read simple scores, and teach songs. As long as the higher authorities determine the song, they can generally solve the problem of teaching singing themselves. Over the past year, each company has generally learned more than thirty songs.

There are evening parties of various sizes almost every Saturday. They watch movies, show slides, organize wired radio broadcasting, and watch performances by professional cultural troupes. But the most common are the soldiers' own small concerts. Every Sunday and holiday, the regiment plans activities. The week before we arrived, the entire regiment collectively visited the nearby "Land Reform Exhibition" and visited engineering equipment. This Sunday was the entire regiment's collective performance of various activities. Next Sunday, they plan to hold a lecture meeting. (Of course, during these holiday activities, they pay great attention to giving the soldiers appropriate time for free activities, rest, and cleanliness and hygiene.)

From "May Fourth" last year to "May Fourth" this year, they held four regimental-scale sports meets. Various battalions and companies conducted thirty-five collective competitions. The regiment held eighteen various evening parties, and the battalions held fifty-nine. The programs they performed themselves numbered four hundred and sixty-two, of which two hundred and nine were created by the soldiers themselves.

In the afternoon, we visited the entire regiment's collective performance of cultural and sports activities. As soon as the loud bugle sounded, the entire group ran into the large playground, and the village immediately boiled. Look! There are ball games on this side, and tug-of-war and wrestling on that side. The river flowing by the village has become a natural swimming pool. How freely and happily the soldiers are floating! Groups and circles are dancing, and darting back and forth are track and field and apparatus exercises. The harmonica is humming, the accordion is playing melodiously, and the loudspeakers of the wired radio are broadcasting healthy dance music and competition reports… In short, here, singing is everywhere, and excitement is everywhere; anyone would say that they are forever happy people! Listen! Their songs and cheers are rippling across the fields, and the surrounding mountains echo in response, and pass over the hills to even farther places.

In the evening, the regiment specially put on the programs that were performed last night for us, to welcome the people who came to visit. In the large auditorium built by the soldiers themselves, which can accommodate more than a thousand people, we enjoyed their self-composed, self-directed, and self-performed "Soldiers Performing for Soldiers" programs and dances. We felt that each program was novel, and everyone was unexpectedly satisfied.

Under the leadership of the regimental Party committee, with the help of the professional cultural troupes and athletes of the unit, and with the soldiers' increased cultural level and higher requirements and love for cultural and sports activities, their organized, led, purposeful, and backbone-led mass cultural and sports activities, in coordination with other central tasks of the unit, brought a new atmosphere to the unit. The unit's political mood was vibrant, the soldiers' physical strength was enhanced. The total number of internal medicine patients in the entire regiment for the year did not exceed 4% of the current number of people, and some companies had no patients for eight or nine months. Soldier Zhu Guilin used to throw grenades 20 meters, but after participating in baseball, he can hit 40 meters. The soldiers said, "If the cultural and sports activities were not developed so well to restore brainpower, our cultural learning would not have the good results we have now." The soldiers said, "The time in a day is too short, it passes joyfully and tensely without us realizing it!" The soldiers said, "Who doesn't love our joyful and warm revolutionary family!" Regimental Commander Sun Guohua said in his summary: "The development of cultural and sports activities not only has not affected any other work, but has made the unit more tense, active, regular, rapid, and enhanced physical strength. This is one of the important factors in building a modern national defense army." Regimental Political Commissar Liu Lian told us: "Unity, tension, liveliness, and seriousness are the glorious traditions of our army; we must cultivate each of our soldiers into people with high cultural attainment."

In an infantry regiment of our People's Liberation Army, we spent an ordinary day so excitedly and satisfactorily. It was late at night, and I still couldn't fall asleep. The intermittent moonlight shone through the window onto my bed. I felt like a child who had been away for a long time, returning to his warm hometown. I excitedly recalled every enthusiastic and familiar face I met today, and I repeatedly murmured: "They are forever people advancing in tension and joy!"

    永远在愉快紧张中前进的人们
    ——记人民解放军某团文化体育活动

    六月里，当热带暴风雨向广州湾进袭的时候，我到达了广州附近的一个乡村。这几天，由于风暴卷来的风雨，把这亚热带当暑的气候，弄得有些像初秋的雨季了。但也就是这个凉爽惬意的天气，使我得以尽情地参观和访问了一个普通的步兵团。
    这是一个浓云密布的早上，汽车沿着蜿蜒的黄沙公路，把我们引进了这个团的驻地，村庄周围长满了灌木丛，一条弯曲的河水从它身边流过，真是一个异常美丽的地方。进了村子，车上的人都东指西点地说：“看我们的战士，把自己的驻地弄得多么整洁舒适呀！”一下了车，首先吸去了我们注意力的是：在清澈的大水塘旁边的一座连队俱乐部，许多人在那里进进出出，我也随着人群挤了进去。这个连队俱乐部的负责同志，热情地向我们一一指点介绍。管图书的同志告诉我：架上的这几百册书，自部队在三月间用速成识字法消灭了文盲后，已远不能满足战士们的需要，因而他们每星期都要向团图书馆借回几十册书来，目前全连已没有不喜欢看书的人了。我顺着他手指的方向，看战士文化程度提高的另一个表现，那是挂满墙报栏的各类稿子，我随便翻看了几篇，战士们已跳出了那种单纯表扬的范围，更多地是写一件具体事物的心得、感想和介绍经验，写得都很朴实生动，而且这种稿件多的时候每天有一二百篇，经常也保持每天三十多篇，由此，也可以看出战士们在有了文化后对写作的兴趣。俱乐部还有个乐器室，里面放着十几件乐器，墙上挂满了曲谱，一个战士兴致勃勃地告诉我，他们的提琴手，以前根本没有拨弄过提琴，但练习了一个月后，就能上台表演和伴和他们的舞蹈了，说着就要表演给我们看。在另一个房子里是他们的创作展览，有他们自编自演的舞蹈照相，有演出受过奖励的小剧、快板等。最引人注意的是正中的大房子——“保持光荣”室，四周都挂满了各种锦旗和嘉奖令等，这些锦旗，有的是上级授予的，有的是老百姓赠送的，也有他们自己在比赛中夺获的。每一面旗都代表着他们的一段光荣历史。其中最突出的是“三好连”奖旗，原来他们这个连，在南下时，战斗、团结和群众工作都有突出的成绩，因而被上级誉为“三好连”。战士们向我虚心地解说时，我为他们保持和发扬了这些光荣而感到崇敬。
    这个俱乐部的布置，由于它切合战士们的实际需要，因而战士们喜爱它，像喜爱自己的课堂操场一样。课外时间，战士们在这里看书、阅报、奏乐、打乒乓，读墙报，或几个人围成一圈辩论个什么问题……。战士们意味深长地告诉我们：“一进了俱乐部就不想出来，出来了也回头再看它几眼。”
    下午我们知道了并不是只这个连有这样的俱乐部，它在全团也不是最突出的，而是每个连都有着战士们喜爱的俱乐部和健全的俱乐部组织。
    我们亲眼看到舞蹈不仅为战士们所喜爱，而且他们能结合着自己的思想情感和生活实际创作了许多新的舞蹈。三月间，一连创作了“炊事班舞”，在华南各野战部队巡回演出了一个多月，博得上级和同志们的称赞。现在全团会跳“红军舞”的几个动作以及“团结舞”、“双人舞”等的人已达百分之七十到九十。他们陆续创作的舞蹈已有二十几个。一连是舞蹈开展得最好的一个连队，他们继
    “炊事班舞”最近又创作了一个思想性强而且艺术性也相当好的“防空舞”，它很受战士们的喜爱。一连的同志还告诉我们这样的一个故事：
    当舞蹈初步开展的时候，全连人都很欢迎，只有老炊事班长不愿参加。每天游戏时，大家都在操场上纵情地跳着，老炊事班长却留在家里。这天，几个青年战士一叽咕就下决心回来把老炊事班长也动员去，可是他们回来后，发现老炊事班长一个人关在屋里，不知干些什么。大家偷偷地一看，哟！原来老班长正一个人在那里挺认真地伸腿弯腰地练习舞蹈的基本动作呢，屋子里闷热，老班长弄得满头大汗，大家哄笑起来，一拥进去，老班长羞得满脸通红，可是从此，游戏时他再也不留在家里了。
    现在，上至团长、政委，下到炊事员、饲养员，都在一起毫无拘束地共舞。休息时随时随地都可以三个一群，五个一伙的舞了起来。甚至急行军休息时，口琴一吹，也就拍着手一边唱一边舞了起来。
    战士们非常喜爱各种球类活动，尤其是篮球，更是战士们普遍参加的运动。团有团队，营有营队，连有连队，甚至各排也有自己的选手。他们相互经常比赛。这天我们参观了几个连的战士球队比赛，不仅技术相当好、规则严，而且非常认真，彬彬有礼，甚至驻地老百姓也反映说：“解放军在玩的时候也有礼貌，这部队真文明。”
    这个团文娱体育活动的其他方面，都开展得非常普遍。这里我来介绍几个数目字：除上面说的篮球外，现有排球队二十一个，棒球队七个，其他还有团体操、器械操、田径赛、乒乓、羽毛球等组织和设备。全团现有提琴、二胡、秦琴、笛子等各种乐器一百六十余件，另外还有百多人的大口琴队，每营都有个业余乐队，每连都有器乐小组和一套打击乐器，最近上级又赠发给他团四个手风琴。这些乐器都已为战士们掌握起来了，可以单独演奏，可以配合舞蹈，也可以伴奏演唱。战士们对音乐那样的喜爱，有些战士把他的二胡从东北背进了关，几年来一同随他行军作战，跋涉了千山万水，战士们说它（乐器）对活跃部队方面，也算有了功劳。现在各连都有几个能指挥、能识简谱教歌的人了，只要上级确定歌篇，自己大致上可以解决教唱问题。一年来各连普遍学会了三十几支歌子。
    差不多每星期六都有大小不同的晚会，看电影、放幻灯、组织有线电广播会，看文工团演出；但最多的还是战士们自己的小演唱。每个星期日和假日，团里都有计划地进行活动，在我们来的前一个星期全团集体参观附近的“土改展览会”和参观工兵器械，这个星期日是全团各项活动会演。下个星期日准备开讲演会。（当然这些假日活动中，他们非常注意给战士们以适当的自由活动、休息和整洁卫生的时间。）
    从去年“五四”到今年“五四”，他们开了四次全团规模的运动大会，各营连进行了各种集体比赛三十五次，团举行过各种晚会十八次，营举行五十九次。只他们自己表演的节目就有四百六十二个，其中有二百零九个是战士们自己创作的。
    下午，我们参观全团的文娱体育活动集体会演，嘹亮的军号一响，全体跑步进入大操场，顿时这个村庄便沸腾起来了。看呀！这边球类比赛，那边拔河摔跤，在村边流过的那条河，就成了天然的游泳场，战士们是多么自由得意的在浮游呀！一团团一圈圈在跳舞，飞来驰去的那是田赛和器械操；口琴呜呜地吹，手风琴悠扬地奏着，有线电广播的大喇叭放送来健康的舞曲和比赛报告……。总之，这里到处洋溢着歌声，到处充满着兴奋；谁也会说他们是永远愉快的人们！听！他们的歌唱和欢呼在田野上荡漾，四周的群山答和着回响，又越过山岗传到更远的地方。
    晚间，团里为欢迎我们来参观的人，特别又把昨天晚上演出的节目，演给我们看。在战士们自己动手建造能容一千多人的大礼堂里，我们欣赏了他们自编自导自演的“兵演兵”节目和舞蹈。我们感到个个节目新颖，每个人都意外地满足。
    在团党委领导下，在部队专业文工团和运动员的帮助下，在战士们提高了文化，对文化体育活动有了更高的要求和喜爱下，他们有组织、有领导、有目的、有骨干的群众性的文化体育活动，配合部队其他中心工作开展起来后，给部队带来了焕然一新的气象。部队政治情绪焕发，战士们体力增强了，全团一年的内科病号的总数，不超过现有人数的百分之四，有些连队八九个月没有病号。战士朱贵林过去投弹二十米，参加打棒球后能打四十米了。战士们说：“要不是文化体育活动开展的好，来恢复脑力，我们的文化学习就不可能有现在这样好的成绩。”战士们说：“一天的时间太短了，不知不觉又愉快紧张地过去了！”战士们说：“谁不热爱我们这喜悦温暖的革命大家庭呢！”团长孙国华同志在总结中说到：“文娱体育活动的开展，不仅没有影响其他任何工作，而使部队更加紧张、活跃、正规、迅速和增强了体力，这是我们建设现代化国防军重要的因素之一。”团政委刘琏同志告诉我们：“团结、紧张、活泼、严肃是我军的光荣传统；我们要把我们的每个战士都培养成有高度文化教养的人们。”
    在我们解放军一个步兵团里，一个普通的日子，我们是多么兴奋满意的度过了。夜深了，我仍不能入眠，时隐时现的月光透过窗子照在我的床上，我感到我像久别的孩子，回到了自己温暖的故乡。我激动地回味着今天我会见的每个热情而又熟悉的面庞，我一再地叨念着：“他们永远是在紧张愉快中前进的人们！”
