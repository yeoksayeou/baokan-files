Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 11th: At the morning session of the fourth day of the World Peace Council Special Session, Fang Shishan, the Chinese representative and medical expert, delivered a speech on the crimes of the United States in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

As a representative of the Chinese medical community, which is working to oppose the inhumane bacteriological warfare, and as a doctor who has fought against human diseases and suffering for more than forty years, I am honored to be invited to attend this meeting of the World Peace Council. In my speech, I will present to you the main factual evidence, personally witnessed and verified by myself and my colleagues, that the United States military is conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China.

The fact that the United States military was spreading insects and other objects carrying pathogens in Korea was discovered on January 28th of this year. As for the same activities engaged in by the United States military in Northeast China, they were discovered on February 29th. However, according to the testimonies of captured American airmen John Quinn and Kenneth Enoch, orders to drop bacteriological bombs were issued to the United States Air Force as early as January 1st. Since then, the bacteriological warfare has been going on for a full half-year, and it has not stopped even now.

Our detection and determination of the United States' conduct of bacteriological warfare is based on the following irrefutable facts:

First, the discovery of American aircraft and artillery units dropping insects, other animals, and other objects. Specimens of these insects, other animals, and other objects, as well as the containers carrying them, have been collected and preserved, and there are eyewitnesses present.

Second, the identification of these specimens by entomologists and zoologists further proves that these things were dropped by American aircraft and artillery units. I can cite many examples of flies. As everyone knows, the lowest temperature limit for the incubation and activity of flies is about 10 degrees Celsius. However, in many parts of Korea and Northeast China, the temperature in February and March was often below minus 8 or 9 degrees Celsius, and the highest temperature never reached 10 degrees Celsius. After the air raids by American aircraft, large and dense populations of these flies were found on the snow. Many insects were found not in their normal habitats. Moreover, many insects with completely different habits were found mixed together.

Third, bacteriologists have found various pathogens in the insects and other objects dropped by American aircraft. The following are the pathogens that I and my colleagues have discovered through meticulous testing using conventional bacteriological, immunological, and animal inoculation methods:

(1) We found plague bacillus in the mice dropped by American aircraft. Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, was attacked by American aircraft on the night of April 4th of this year. The next morning, a large number of field mice were found. After testing, it was proven that these field mice carried the plague bacillus. In areas of Korea where the United States airdropped mice, several mice infected with the plague bacillus were also found.

(2) We found Vibrio cholerae in the clams airdropped by American aircraft. The tested sample was dropped by American aircraft on the night of May 16th over Che-ri, Gupyeong Township, Daedong County, South Pyongan Province, about 30 kilometers west of Pyongyang. The purpose of the United States military in dropping these clams was clearly to contaminate a tap water reservoir there, but as a result, the clams fell on a hillside about 700 meters away from the reservoir.

(3) We found typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli in the large flies and dung flies dropped by American aircraft. On March 15th of this year, American aircraft dropped a large number of large flies and other insects near the dormitory of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government in Shenyang, China. After testing, it was proven that these large flies carried typhoid bacilli. In addition, typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli were also found in the dung flies dropped by American aircraft in Jinzhou City.

(4) We found dysentery and paratyphoid dysentery bacilli in the small fish and black springtails dropped by American aircraft. For example, on March 10th of this year, American aircraft dropped many small fish, each about an inch long, near a small river in Nipingdong, Daedong County, Korea, on a hillside and in dry rice paddies. The test results showed that these small fish carried Shigella dysenteriae. On February 25th of this year, American aircraft dropped a batch of black springtails in the villages of Sangpali and Sangsipripyeong in Korea. After testing, it was proven that these black springtails carried Shigella paradysenteriae.

(5) We found Pasteurella multocida, which causes hemorrhagic septicemia in chickens and ducks, on a type of spider (wolf spider) dropped by American aircraft in various parts of Northeast China.

(6) We found soybean purple spot fungus in the large soybean pods dropped by American aircraft. The tested sample was dropped by American aircraft over Yeonpung-ri, Goan Township, Jeongju County, Korea, on March 20th of this year.

(7) We found plant anthracnose fungus, which harms cotton, apples, and pear trees, in the leaves dropped by American aircraft. The tested sample was dropped by American aircraft over a certain area in North Korea on February 28th and collected and sent to the testing agency by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

These are just a few examples of the various heinous bacteriological weapons that the United States military has used against the people of Korea and China, which we have confirmed so far.

Fourth, as a result of the United States military's conduct of bacteriological warfare, peaceful people in Korea and China, including women, children, and the elderly, have tragically died. After American aircraft dropped plague germs, multiple cases of plague were discovered simultaneously in several areas of Korea. These cases included not only bubonic plague but also septicemic plague with an extremely severe course. After American aircraft dropped cholera pathogens, multiple cases of cholera, which had not been found in Korea since 1947, occurred. Han Sang-guk, an elderly man from Nammun-ri, Pyongyang, and his two grandchildren died one after another after being infected with cholera germs. Zhao Wan-bok, a farmer from Che-ri, Gupyeong Township, Daedong County, and his wife, Lee Young-ja, also died tragically after eating clam meat dropped by American aircraft, which was later tested and found to contain Vibrio cholerae. In addition, in some areas of Northeast China that had been invaded by American aircraft, a sudden acute infectious disease, never before found in China, was also discovered. Its clinical manifestations were consistent with acute encephalitis. The main symptoms were fever, impaired consciousness, headache, vomiting, and convulsions. From a pathological anatomical perspective, those who died from this disease, in addition to having encephalitis lesions, some also had special pneumonia lesions. This pneumonia lesion was different from common lobar pneumonia that causes death. The lesion area of the lung was, in most cases, less than a quarter of the total area of one lung lobe, and the course of the disease was very short, with most of those who died from this disease dying in less than 48 hours. Based on these reasons, we determined that this acute infectious disease was undoubtedly manufactured by the American bacteriological killing factory. Finally, as a result of the United States military spreading anthrax germs and Pasteurella multocida, which causes hemorrhagic septicemia in chickens and ducks, livestock and poultry also died in large numbers in certain areas of Korea and China that had been frequently invaded by American aircraft.

Fifth, the voluntary testimonies provided by American prisoners captured on the Korean front also confirm the fact that the United States government is conducting bacteriological warfare. My colleagues, entomologist Dr. Chen Shixiang and associate professor of bacteriology Zhang Naichu, personally interrogated two American Air Force prisoners, John Quinn and Kenneth Enoch. As everyone knows, they both confessed to their crimes of dropping bacteriological bombs.

This is the main factual evidence that I want to present to prove that the United States government is conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China. These facts have been verified as accurate through objective investigations and research.

I personally participated in most of these investigations and research work. As an old Chinese doctor who has been engaged in medical work for more than forty years, witnessing the heinous crimes of the American aggressors manufacturing plagues to exterminate peaceful people, I feel indescribable anger. I believe that no one with human conscience, loyal to science, and loving justice and civilization can tolerate such atrocities. In order to stop this inhumane behavior, in order to uphold the honor of science and the cause of world peace, I and all the people of our country stand together, resolutely supporting the appeal made by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in its "Appeal to the Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" on April 1st of this year, demanding that the people of the world rise up to stop bacteriological warfare; at the same time, demanding that effective action be taken to bring those criminals who use the most despicable, filthy, and appalling weapons to justice as war criminals.

Finally, I want to report to the conference that our people, together with the Korean people, with the support of the people of the world, are confident of shattering the enemy's bacteriological warfare conspiracy. In the past six months, in order to overcome bacteriological warfare, a very large-scale epidemic prevention and health campaign has been launched in China and Korea. From cities to villages, people have been mobilized and organized to implement cleaning campaigns, eliminate disease vectors, and protect the cleanliness of food and water sources. In areas where the United States has spread insects and other debris, effective measures have been taken to quickly eliminate these dangerous things. Emergency epidemic prevention measures have been taken in areas where epidemics have occurred. Another important task is that we have carried out widespread preventive vaccinations. Because of all this, we have effectively prevented the spread of the plague that the enemy attempted to create. This fact has taught our people that as long as we unite and take strong action, the enemy's bacteriological warfare can be completely shattered by us.

    世界和平理事会特别会议四日会议上
    我代表方石珊谴责美国进行细菌战的发言
    【新华社柏林十一日电】在世界和平理事会特别会议四日上午会议上，中国代表、医学专家方石珊作了关于美国在朝鲜及中国东北等地进行细菌战罪行的发言，全文如下：主席、各位代表：
    作为正在为反对毁灭人道的细菌战而工作的中国医学界的代表，作为一个与人类的疾病痛苦斗争了四十多年的医生，我得以被邀出席世界和平理事会本次会议，实为荣幸。我在我的发言里，将向各位先生提出为我本人及我的同事们所亲眼看到和亲自证实的美国军队正在向朝中人民进行细菌战的主要事实证据。
    美国军队在朝鲜撒布带有病原体的昆虫及其他物体，是从今年一月二十八日起才被发觉的。至于美国军队在中国东北地区所从事的同样活动，则自二月二十九日起才被发现。但是事实上，根据被俘的美国空军人员约翰·奎恩和凯尼斯·伊纳克所作的证词，美国空军部队自一月一日起即已下达投掷细菌弹的命令。自那时起，细菌战的进行，已足足持续了半年的时间；而且直到现在，还没有停止。
    我们察觉并断定美国进行细菌战，乃是根据以下各种不可动摇的事实：
    首先就是美国飞机和美国炮兵部队投撒昆虫、其他动物及其他物体的被发现。这些昆虫与其他动物和物体的标本，以及装载昆虫与其他动物及其他物体的容器等，都已收集保存，而且都有在场目睹的人证。
    其次就是昆虫学专家及动物学专家们对于这些标本所作的鉴定，进一步证明了这些东西是美国飞机及炮兵部队所投撒的。我可以举出许多蝇类的例子。大家都知道，蝇类的孵化和活动的最低温度界限，是摄氏十度左右，但是在朝鲜及中国东北的许多地方，在二、三月间温度经常在摄氏零下八、九度，而最高温度从来没有达到摄氏十度的时候，在美国飞机的空袭之后，却在雪地上发现了这些蝇子的大量密集的存在。许多昆虫的被发现，不是在正常状态下它们所栖居活动的地方。而且许多习惯完全不相同的昆虫被发现时是混杂在一起的。
    第三，就是细菌学专家们从美国飞机所投下的昆虫及其他物体中查出了各种病原体。以下就是我和我的同事们用细菌学、免疫学及动物接种的常规方法，经过缜密检验而查出的病原体：
    （一）我们从美国飞机所投下的老鼠中，查出了鼠疫杆菌。中国东北黑龙江省甘南县在今年四月四日夜间受到了美国飞机的空袭，次日晨即发现了大批小田鼠，经过检验，证明了这种小田鼠带有鼠疫杆菌。在朝鲜的美国空投过老鼠的地区，也发现了受到鼠疫杆菌感染的老鼠多只。
    （二）我们从美国飞机空投的蚌蛤中，查出了霍乱弧菌。检验的样品是今年五月十六日夜间美国飞机在平壤以西约三十公里的平安南道大同郡古坪面车里的上空投下的。美国军队这次投掷蚌蛤的目的，显然是想要污染在那里的一个自来水蓄水池的，但结果蚌蛤却错落在距蓄水池约七百公尺的山坡上。
    （三）我们从美国飞机投下的大家蝇、粪蝇中，查出了伤寒及副伤寒杆菌。今年三月十五日，美国飞机在中国的沈阳市东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近投下了大批大家蝇及其他昆虫，经过检验，证明这批大家蝇带有伤寒杆菌。此外，在美国飞机在锦州市投下的粪蝇中，也分别查出了伤寒及副伤寒杆菌。
    （四）我们从美国飞机投下的小鱼及黑跳虫中，查出了痢疾及副痢疾杆菌。例如今年三月十日，美国飞机在朝鲜的大同郡泥坪洞小河附近的山坡上及干稻田里投下了许多一寸多长的小鱼；检验结果，发现这些小鱼带有志贺氏痢疾杆菌。今年二月二十五日，美国飞机在朝鲜的上八里、上十里坪村投下一批黑跳虫；经过检验，证明这些黑跳虫带有志贺氏副痢疾杆菌。
    （五）我们在美国飞机在中国东北各地所投下的一种蜘蛛（狼蛛）身上，查出了鸡、鸭出血性败血症巴氏杆菌。
    （六）我们从美国飞机投下的大荳荚中查出了大荳紫斑病菌。检验的样品是今年三月二十日美国飞机在朝鲜的定州郡高安面延丰里上空投下的。
    （七）我们从美国飞机投下的树叶中，查出了危害棉花、苹果和梨树的植物炭疽病菌。检验的样品是二月二十八日美国飞机在北朝鲜某地上空投下，由中国人民志愿军某部收集送到检验机关来的。
    这些就是迄今为止我们所已经确实查明的美国军队对朝中人民所使用的各种凶恶的细菌武器之数例。
    第四，美国军队进行细菌战的结果，朝中两国已有和平人民，包括妇女、儿童和老人惨遭死亡，在美国飞机投下鼠疫病菌之后，朝鲜的若干地方已经同时发现了鼠疫病例多起。这些病例中，不但包括淋巴腺型鼠疫，而且包括病程极强的败血性鼠疫。在美国飞机投撒霍乱病原体之后，朝鲜自一九四七年来即未发现的霍乱病例亦已多次发生。平壤市南门里的老人韩相国和他的两个孙子，就是因为感染了霍乱病菌而相继死亡的。大同郡古坪面车里的农民赵万福和他的妻子李英子，因为吃了美国飞机所投下、后经检验带有霍乱弧菌的蚌肉，也惨遭死亡。除此以外，在美国飞机侵入过的中国东北的有些地区，还突然发现了一种中国所从未发现过的急性传染病。它的临床现象，符合于急性脑炎。主要症状是发热，意识障碍，头痛，呕吐和惊厥等。从病理解剖方面来看，因得这种病而死亡的人，除有脑炎病变之外，有一部分还兼有特殊性的肺炎病变。这种肺炎病变与普通致人死命的大叶肺炎不同，肺的病变部分绝大多数不及一页肺全部面积的四分之一，而且病程很短，因患这种病而死亡者大多数不及四十八时即死亡。根据这些理由，我们判定这种急性传染病，无疑是美国细菌杀人工厂所制造的。最后，由于美国军队撒布炭疽病菌和鸡、鸭出血性败血症巴氏杆菌的结果，在朝中两国被美国飞机频繁侵入的某些地区，家畜和家禽也发生过成批死亡的现象。
    第五，由朝鲜前线捕获的美国俘虏所自愿提供的证词，也证实了美国政府进行细菌战的事实。我的同事昆虫学家陈世骧博士和细菌学家张乃初副教授曾经亲自询问过两个美国空军俘虏，即约翰·奎恩和凯尼斯·伊纳克。如同大家所周知的：他们都坦白地说出了他们投掷过细菌弹的罪行。
    这些就是我要提出的证明美国政府对朝鲜和中国人民进行细菌战的主要事实证据。这些事实都是经过客观的调查研究证实无误的。
    这些调查研究工作我大部分都亲自参加了，作为一个从事医务工作四十多年的中国老医生，目睹美国侵略者制造瘟疫来消灭和平人民的万恶罪行，我感到不能以言语形容的愤怒。我相信：凡是有人类良知的、忠于科学的、爱好正义和文明的人，没有一个人是能够容忍这种暴行的。为了制止这种毁灭人道的行为，为了维护科学的荣誉和世界的和平事业，我和我们国家的全体人民在一起，坚决拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会在今年四月一日在“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书中所提出的号召，要求全世界人民起来制止细菌战；同时要求采取有效的行动，把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊的、最骇人闻听的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。
    最后，我要向大会报告的是：我国人民和朝鲜人民在一起，在全世界人民的支援之下，我们是有信心粉碎敌人细菌战的阴谋的。在过去半年之内，为了战胜细菌战，在中朝两国已经展开了极大规模的防疫卫生运动。从城市到乡村，人们都已经动员和组织起来，厉行清洁运动，消灭疾病的媒介物，保护食物和水源的清洁。在美国撒布昆虫及其他杂物的地区，则采取有效的措施，来迅速消灭这些危险的东西。对于有疫病发生的地区，则采取了紧急的防疫措施。还有一个重要的工作，就是我们进行了普遍的预防注射。由于这一切，我们便有效地阻止着敌人所企图制造的瘟疫的流行。这种事实教训了我们的人民，只要我们团结一致地采取强有力的行动，敌人的细菌战是能够被我们彻底粉碎的。
