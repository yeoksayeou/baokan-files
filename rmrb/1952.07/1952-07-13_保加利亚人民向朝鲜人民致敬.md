    Bulgarian People Pay Tribute to the Korean People
    Bulgaria Fu. Duo Bianchalov
    As the United States' shameless aggression against Korea marks its second anniversary, the Bulgarian people extend their brotherly and heartfelt respect to the Korean people, who are valiantly fighting to defend peace against aggression, to defend democratic freedom, and against imperialist enslavement.
    During World War II, the Nazi aggressors plundered the Bulgarian people. No sooner had the war ended than the American imperialists launched a war of aggression against Korea, attacking the peace-loving and hardworking Korean people. The Wall Street lackeys tried to coerce the Korean people and other countries with brutal means of destruction. However, the Korean people's struggle shattered the myth of American imperialism's "invincibility" and proved that new aggressors can be stopped and defeated.
    It is not only the American aggressors who have suffered defeat in Korea, but also their servants in other parts of the world. The Korean people have given the royalist fascists in Greece and the reactionaries in Turkey an excellent lesson. Today, they are glancing askance from Ankara and Athens, looking at the heroic Korea. The Turkish detachment lost more than half of its troops in the Yalu River basin. The Greek contingent was crushed on the hills of Korea. Mournful processions greet the ships returning to Piraeus and Istanbul, carrying not spoils of war or glory, but the coffins of Greek and Turkish soldiers.
    The great heroism displayed by the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the struggle against American aggression in distant Korea has had an impact on the situation in the Balkans. Our train driver, David Kov, said: "We will never forget the Korean people's contribution to humanity and to us, the Bulgarian people. We understand very well that if it were not for the Korean people's resistance and their great sacrifice, the American warmongers would have launched new adventures, and their Turkish and Greek lackeys would have followed suit." David Kov's words sufficiently represent the view of all Bulgarian working people on the great struggle in Korea. Therefore, our gratitude to the Korean people is deep and sincere.
    The Bulgarian Committee for Aid to Korea's declaration has been met with a response from the entire Bulgarian people. More than 2.5 million items of clothing, shoes, blankets, bed sheets, food, medicine, and other supplies collected during the two donation campaigns in 1951 and 1952 have been sent to the heroic Korean people. Bulgarian mothers, fathers, and children, when presenting gifts to their Korean comrades and children, expressed their brotherly solidarity with the Korean people in touching words.
    "I am the happy mother of seven children. My children live in freedom and happiness. For the sake of my children, and for the children of other mothers, I want to defend peace, because I don't want them to be cannon fodder in imperialist wars. My gift is small, but I sincerely offer it to the fighting Korean people. They are fighting for my children and the children of other mothers," said Anna Akmedova when donating her gift.
    "My unknown Korean friend, I am sending you a pair of boots from my happy Dimitrov homeland, a country that teaches children to love those countries that are fighting for a peaceful and happy life." These are the opening words of a letter placed in the boots of little Marin Panchov, a third-grade Young Pioneer at the Stara Zagora School.
    Bulgarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals are enthusiastically supporting the Korean people. "We must give all possible assistance to the people of any country that so heroically resists American aggression and so resolutely defends its freedom and independence. We miners must enthusiastically assist the Korean people," said miner Lusi Grudev, speaking on behalf of the miners of the Dimitrov coal mine center. The Bulgarian farmers who formed the cooperative farms each donated a considerable portion of their income to the Korean relief fund and promised to support more than two hundred Korean orphans.
    The historical achievements of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have greatly inspired the Bulgarian working people, prompting them to strive for even greater labor achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Bulgarian workers in factories, power stations, dams, and cooperative farms have written pledges to increase work speed and overfulfill production plans as a symbol of solidarity with the fighting Korean people. Work teams have adopted the glorious names of Korean and Chinese leaders Kim Il-sung and Mao Zedong as their team names. They are loved by the masses in Bulgaria, just like our own leaders.
    Some of Bulgaria's most outstanding poets and writers are writing about the life and struggle of the Korean people. The writer Georgi Karaslavov, who visited Korea this spring with a Bulgarian delegation, has written inspiring and moving pages in his travelogue "North Korea." This book has been published by the Bulgarian Communist Party's central organ, "Rabotnichesko Delo." Poets Hristo Radevski, Mladen Isaev, Maria Grubeshlieva, and other poets have dedicated beautiful poems full of emotion to the suffering and glory of the Korean people, their patriotism, their loyalty to international proletarian solidarity, and their historical heroism. Painters Stoyan Sotirov, sculptors Dalchev and Fonav, and many other artists have created fresh works of socialist art depicting the struggle and heroism of the invincible Korean people.
    The heroic actions of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have left a deep mark on Bulgarian art and literature – every chapter permeated with profound socialist ideology, containing a high degree of principle, patriotic enthusiasm, and loyalty to proletarian internationalism and the Soviet Union. This heroism has inspired the creation of many works of art that depict the great loyalty of peace fighters, the invincibility of the people's power, and the just cause of defending peace, democracy, and socialism.
    What the Korean nation has shown is that a nation defending its own freedom has inexhaustible strength and means. A nation that is fighting for freedom and peace with the support of strong international solidarity, a nation that is extremely loyal and loving to the Soviet Union, the great standard-bearer of human freedom and peace, cannot be destroyed by any force in the world. The heroism of the Korean people is a brilliant example and a source of confidence in resisting and defeating imperialist aggression by relying on one's own strength.
    The Bulgarian people express their heartfelt gratitude to the heroic Korean soldiers, to the Korean men and women who are supporting the front lines of their homeland, and to the fearless Chinese People's Volunteers, for the splendid achievements they have accomplished over the past two years. They have also defended the Bulgarian people and set an example for the Bulgarian working people and intellectuals to fight against American imperialism and new warmongers.
    Korea must win, and it can only win. Two years of heroic fighting and resolute heroism are eloquent proof.

    保加利亚人民向朝鲜人民致敬
    保加利亚  符·多变察罗夫
    当美国无耻地进攻朝鲜已满两年的时候，保加利亚人民特向为了保卫和平反对侵略，保卫民主自由，反对帝国主义奴役而英勇斗争的朝鲜人民致以兄弟般深切的敬意。
    在第二次世界大战期间，纳粹侵略者劫掠了保加利亚人民。大战刚刚停止，美帝国主义者便发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，进攻爱好和平的、勤劳的朝鲜人民。华尔街的走狗们竭力想用残暴无比的毁灭手段来胁迫朝鲜人民和其他国家，但是，朝鲜人民的斗争粉碎了美帝国主义“所向无敌”的神话，并且证明了新的侵略者是可以被制止和被击溃的。
    在朝鲜遭受到失败的不仅是美国侵略者，而且是在世界其他地方的他们的仆从们。朝鲜人民给希腊的保皇法西斯分子和土耳其反动派上了出色的一课。今天他们从安卡拉和雅典斜过眼来，看着英勇的朝鲜。土耳其支队在鸭绿江流域丢失了一大半队伍。希腊联队在朝鲜的山坡上被打垮了。哀悼的行列迎接着回到比里犹斯和伊斯坦布尔去的船只，其中所装载的不是什么战利品和光荣的东西，却是希腊兵和土耳其步兵的棺材。
    在辽远的朝鲜进行着的反抗美国侵略的斗争中，朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军所表现的伟大的英雄行为对于巴尔干的形势是有作用的。我国火车司机大卫考夫说过：“朝鲜人民对于人类，对于我们保加利亚人民的功劳，我们永远忘不掉。我们非常明白：要是没有朝鲜人民的抵抗和他们的伟大牺牲，美国的战争挑拨者们就会发动新的冒险，他们的土耳其和希腊走狗们也就会跟着干。”大卫考夫的话足以代表所有保加利亚劳动人民对朝鲜的伟大斗争的看法。所以我们对朝鲜人民的感激是深切而真挚的。
    保加利亚对朝鲜的救济委员会的宣言，得到了保加利亚全国人民的响应。在一九五一和一九五二年的两次捐献运动中所征集的二百五十万件以上衣服、鞋、毯子、床单、食物、药品和其他物品，都已给英勇的朝鲜人民送去。保加利亚的母亲、父亲和儿童在把礼物献给朝鲜的同志们和孩子们的时候，用动人的语言来表示他们和朝鲜人民的兄弟般的团结。
    “我是七个孩子的幸福母亲。我的孩子们在自由与幸福中生活。为了我的孩子们，为了其他母亲的孩子们，我要保卫和平，因为我不要他们去做帝国主义战争的炮灰。我的礼物很小，但我是真心拿出来送给战斗着的朝鲜人民的。他们是为了我的孩子们和别的母亲的孩子们而战斗着。”安娜·阿克梅多娃在捐献她的礼物时这样说。
    “我的不知名的朝鲜朋友，我从我这幸福的季米特洛夫祖国寄给你一双靴子，这个国家教导孩子们要爱那些为和平幸福的生活而进行战斗的国家。”这是在斯塔拉·查果拉学校三年级少年先锋队员小玛琳·潘奇夫的靴子里放着的一封信上的开头几句话。
    保加利亚的工人、农民和人民的知识分子，十分热情地支援着朝鲜人民。“对于这样英勇地反抗美国侵略，这样坚强地保卫自己的自由和独立的任何国家的人民，必须给予一切的援助。我们矿工一定热情地援助朝鲜人民。”矿工卢西·格鲁德夫，在他代表季米特洛夫煤矿中心的矿工们发言中这样说。组成合作农场的保加利亚农民，每人把自己的收入中相当大的一部分捐作朝鲜救济金并答应赡养朝鲜孤儿二百多名。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的历史性的业绩，大大地激励了保加利亚劳动人民，推动他们在社会主义建设事业中争取更高的劳动成就。在保加利亚工厂中、电力站中、堤坝上和合作农场中的保加利亚工人，写下了提高工作速度、超额完成生产计划的保证书，作为与战斗着的朝鲜人民团结的标帜。工作队用朝鲜和中国人民领袖金日成和毛泽东的光荣名字作为队名。他们在保加利亚，就像我们自己的领袖一样，受着群众的爱戴。
    保加利亚最杰出的一些诗人和作家写作着关于朝鲜人民的生活和斗争的作品。作家乔治·卡拉斯拉渥夫，今年春初同着保加利亚代表团访问过朝鲜，在他的旅行记“北朝鲜”里，写出了令人鼓舞的动人的篇页。这本书已由保共中央机关刊“工人事业报”出版。诗人赫利斯托·拉戴夫斯基，姆拉敦·伊萨耶夫，玛利亚·古拜希利耶娃和其他诗人，把充满感情的美妙诗篇献给了朝鲜人民的受难和光荣、朝鲜人民的爱国主义、他们对国际无产阶级团结的忠诚、他们历史性的英雄行为。画家斯多扬·索第罗夫，雕刻家达尔契夫和福纳夫及其他许多艺术家，创作了新鲜的社会主义艺术作品，描写着不可战胜的朝鲜人民的斗争和英雄行为。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英雄行为在保加利亚的艺术和文学中留下了深深的印记——全章渗透着深刻的社会主义思想内容，含蓄着高度的原则、爱国的热情以及对无产阶级国际主义与对苏联的忠诚。这一种英雄行为鼓舞了许多艺术作品的创作，那些作品是描写和平战士的伟大忠诚，人民力量的不可战胜，保卫和平、民主及社会主义的正直事业的。
    朝鲜民族所表现的就是一个保卫着本身自由的民族是有无穷尽的力量和办法的。这么一个有强大的国际团结支援着的为自由与和平而斗争的民族，这么一个对人类自由与和平的伟大旗手苏联十分忠诚信爱的民族，在世界上是没有任何力量能够把它摧毁的。朝鲜人民的英雄行为，是光辉的榜样，是靠自己力量来抵抗并战胜帝国主义侵略的信心的泉源。
    保加利亚人民向英勇的朝鲜战士、向支援祖国前线的朝鲜的男女，向大无畏的中国人民志愿军表示衷心的感激，为的是他们两年来所完成的灿烂的功业。他们同时也保卫了保加利亚人民，而给保加利亚劳动人民和知识分子树立了对美帝国主义和新战争挑拨者进行斗争的榜样。
    朝鲜一定要胜利，它只能胜利。两年来英勇的战斗和刚毅的英雄行为，就是雄辩的证明。
