Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st - Christian organizations in Northeast China and Shenyang, including the Northeast General Assembly of the Church of Christ in China and various churches in Shenyang, the Northeast Federation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and various churches in Shenyang, the Shenyang Christian Pentecostal Church, and the Shenyang Christian Baptist Church, issued a joint statement on the 19th, strongly condemning the British ruling group's despicable behavior in attempting to persecute Reverend Johnson. The full text of the statement is as follows: "Reverend Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury in England, revealed to the deceived people the irrefutable evidence he collected during his visit to our country regarding the U.S. imperialists' germ warfare, and condemned the towering crimes of the American aggressors in waging germ warfare in Korea and China, upholding God's righteousness. This righteous action represents not only the British people but also the common will of peace-loving Christians around the world. However, the British ruling group, as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea, has wantonly slandered and threatened the just Reverend Johnson. We believe that all unreasonable persecution of peace fighters by the British ruling group will only deepen Reverend Johnson's and the British people's will and actions to fight for peace. At the same time, this persecution by the British ruling group will only further expose their ugly face as willing lackeys of Wall Street, and arouse the unanimous contempt of the British people and the people of the world. We, all Christians in Northeast China and Shenyang, firmly support Reverend Johnson's just actions, closely monitor the British government's shameful behavior of opposing and obstructing the people's peace movement, and condemn it."

Sun Pengxi, Chairman of the Northeast General Assembly of the Church of Christ in China, Liu Changli, President of the Northeast Federation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Han Shiji, Chairman of the Shenyang Catholic Reform Committee, also jointly protested against the British government's despicable act of attempting to harm Reverend Johnson. In their protest letter, they pointed out: "The British government, in a country that claims to be a Christian civilization, has openly slandered and attempted to persecute Reverend Johnson, who speaks out righteously and opposes inhumane germ warfare in the true spirit of Christianity. This is absolutely intolerable to us who are loyal to Christianity. We want to solemnly tell the British ruling group: Reverend Johnson cannot be bullied. He has long had a profound influence in the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world. His years of efforts in the peace movement represent the will of peace-loving and kind Christians around the world. What he does in England is also what our five million Christians and Catholics in China do. We unanimously support Reverend Johnson's righteous actions and firmly oppose any persecution and unreasonable measures by the British government."

    东北及沈阳基督教团体发表声明
    谴责英国统治集团阴谋迫害约翰逊教长
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】中华基督教会东北大会和沈阳市各教会、基督复临安息日会东北联合会和沈阳市各教会、沈阳市基督教神召会、沈阳市基督教浸信会等宗教团体，十九日发表联合声明，严厉谴责英国统治集团企图迫害约翰逊教长的卑鄙行为。声明全文如下：“英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊把在我国参观、访问所收集的关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的铁证，秉着上帝的公义向被欺骗的人们揭发了，谴责了美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的滔天罪行。这种正义的行动，不仅代表着英国人民，也代表着全世界爱好和平的基督教徒的共同意志。但作为美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的帮凶的英国统治集团，竟对公正的约翰逊教长大肆诽谤和威胁，我们相信：英国统治集团对和平战士的一切无理迫害，只有更加深约翰逊教长和英国人民为和平而斗争的意志和行动；同时英国统治集团的这种迫害行为，也只有愈加暴露他们甘愿充当华尔街小伙计的丑恶嘴脸，而引起英国人民和全世界人民的一致鄙视。我们东北和沈阳市全体基督教徒，坚决支持约翰逊教长的正义行动，对于英国政府敌视和阻挠人民和平运动的可耻行为，予以密切注意，并加以谴责。”
    中华基督教会东北大会理事长孙鹏翕、基督复临安息日会东北联合会会长刘常礼、沈阳市天主教革新委员会主任委员韩世骥等，也联名抗议英国政府企图加害约翰逊教长的卑鄙行径。他们在抗议书中指出：“号称基督教文明国家的英国，它的政府竟对一位仗义执言、以基督教的真精神反对惨无人道细菌战的约翰逊教长，公然加以诬蔑和企图施行迫害，这对于我们忠于基督教的人们是绝不能容忍的。我们要正告英国统治集团：约翰逊教长是欺侮不得的，他在全世界爱好和平人民的心目中早已有着深厚的影响，他多年来从事和平运动的努力，正是代表着全世界爱好和平的善良教徒的意志，他在英国所做的，也是我们中国五百万基督教徒和天主教徒所做的。我们一致支持约翰逊教长的正义行动，坚决反对英国政府的任何迫害行动和无理措施。”
