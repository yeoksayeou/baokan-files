Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch from New York:

    This November, the United States will hold its second presidential election since the war. Since the beginning of the year, the two major bourgeois parties that rule the United States, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, have each launched a competition for candidate nominations. So far, on the Republican side, Taft and Eisenhower have formed two major factions that overwhelm other candidates. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has not yet had a centralized candidate, with Senator Kefauver, who was once a celebrity for investigating government corruption, leading the way. In a few days, the Republican and Democratic parties will hold national conventions in Chicago to determine their final candidates for the presidential election.
    A prominent feature of this year's two-party campaign is that foreign policy has become the focus of debate, and this debate is characterized by attacks and criticisms of the Truman administration.
    Since suffering the greatest defeat in American history in Korea, the Truman policy has become an ominous name in the United States. In the two parties' campaigns, anyone who has anything to do with it is eager to get rid of its entanglements and tries to attack it as much as possible as long as they can act as the opposition. Even Connally, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a veteran Democrat, once became a sharp critic of the Truman policy before finally deciding to give up his ambition to run for office. Eisenhower, although actually a supporter and executor of Truman's foreign expansion and arms race policies, emphasized at his first press conference after returning to the country that he "never participated in government affairs, and therefore did not participate in the entire American foreign policy." Later, he flatly denied that Truman had discussed the Democratic candidate nomination with him. Dissatisfaction with Truman's policies from all sides has reached such a degree that a public movement against Truman has formed within the Democratic Party. Powerful Southern Democratic leaders have even announced that if Truman runs as the Democratic candidate, they would rather let the Republican Party take power.
    Due to the Democratic Party's sluggish campaign situation so far, general attention has been focused on the Republican Party. Here, Taft and Eisenhower have each collected about two-thirds of the delegate votes needed to obtain the final nomination in the primaries, and are engaged in fierce competition. The main debate between Taft and Eisenhower focuses on foreign policy and related domestic measures. Their campaign rhetoric in this regard fully reflects the chaotic contradictions and the inability to find a way out within the American ruling group.
    Representing the faction in the ruling group that more realistically sees the failure of the United States and the fact that the United States' strength is insufficient to complete the current scale of global expansion plans, Taft demands a change in the Truman administration's current aggressive policy. He advocates ending the "fruitless war" in Korea, reducing the already excessive budget, not assuming too much financial and military responsibility in Western Europe, and concentrating efforts on building an air force as a means of intimidating diplomacy, and seizing the opportunity to attack the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Regarding the ultimate goal of this aggressive policy, Taft made it clear in a foreign policy speech on June 1st: Once the domestic mobilization is done, "we can set off again on a crusade to spread the doctrine of individual freedom to the world." He firmly denied that he was an isolationist, but he admitted that the current excessive expansion of the United States would lead to bankruptcy. The failure in the Korean War led him to the conclusion that it is impossible to defeat the peaceful and democratic camp on the continent. In order to evade the responsibility of the Republican Party for supporting the Truman administration's bankrupt policy on all major foreign expansions in the post-war United States, Taft now emphasizes that there is no so-called "bipartisan" policy in diplomacy. He also described the Truman-Acheson diplomacy as "the most disastrous" in American history. This Republican leader who originally supported Truman's intervention in Korea now says that he has "changed his mind" and now believes it was a "mistake." This attempt to admit the failure of the United States while trying to portray himself as an opponent of the current aggressive policy that is bankrupting the United States often leads to self-contradiction. Even the American "Time" magazine said that in his efforts to oppose Truman, he made "often confusing" remarks that "sounded contradictory."
    On the other hand, Eisenhower admits that "disunity" within the American ruling group is a "threat" (speech in Abilene on June 4th - "Newsweek" June 16th). He scolded Taft as an "ignorant and irresponsible person," saying that his views were "stupid, shallow" isolationist views that would only "invite destruction" (speech in Denver on June 23rd - United Press International, June 23rd). Eisenhower insists that the so-called "collective security" policy and the establishment of "strength" must continue, so he strongly opposes large-scale cuts in military spending (including so-called "military aid"). He also said that if he becomes president, he would cut taxes by $40 billion. He did not explain how he could cut taxes so much while continuing the huge military program. The deceptive nature of this purely election-oriented political trick is so obvious that even Truman's speech in Groton commented that it was a "ridiculous thing" done by someone who "wants to get on stage" (Associated Press, June 14th). Truman also said at a press conference on June 20th that no Democratic or Republican president could do such a reduction. In fact, the US government's current fiscal deficit has reached 70 to 80 billion US dollars annually. On the Korean issue, Eisenhower opposes Taft's plan, advocating to "hold on," but also had to admit that he "does not have any prescription for achieving decisive results" ("Time" magazine, June 16th). Like Taft, Eisenhower also puts himself in a clearly self-contradictory position in the campaign. In order to show that he is a genuine Republican with no ties to the Democratic government, Eisenhower stated at a press conference in Abilene on June 5th that the basis of his "political philosophy" was the declaration jointly issued by Republican congressmen and the National Committee in February 1950. This declaration was drafted by the "isolationist" Taft, whom Eisenhower has been trying to attack. Thus, the magazine "Time," owned by one of Eisenhower's backers, Luce, could not help but express disappointment with his achievements, believing that he had not created the "explosive" influence that his supporters originally expected of him since his return to the country. In analyzing the reasons, the June 23rd issue of "Time" magazine pointed out: "His biggest failure so far is the lack of a practical, forward-looking program."
    The above-mentioned characteristics of the American two-party campaign and the complaints of "Time" magazine show that the American ruling group has fallen into an incurable state of contradiction and chaos two years after the Korean War.

### 美国民主党和共和党的竞选运动  反映出美国统治集团内部的混乱和困难

    美国民主党和共和党的竞选运动
    反映出美国统治集团内部的混乱和困难
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：今年十一月，美国将举行战后第二次总统选举。自从开年以来，统治美国的两大资产阶级政党民主党和共和党就分别展开了候选人提名的竞争。到现在为止，在共和党方面，塔夫脱和艾森豪威尔已形成压倒其他候选人的两大派。民主党则迄今还未曾有集中的候选人人选，比较领先的是因调查政府腐败而曾经一时成为红人的参议员克福维尔。日内，共和民主两党即将在芝加哥先后分别举行全国代表大会，以确定各自参加总统竞选的最后人选。
    今年两党竞选运动中的一个突出的特点，就是外交政策成为争论的焦点，而这种争论又以攻击和批评杜鲁门政府为特色。
    自从在朝鲜遭到了美国开国以来最大的失败，杜鲁门政策在美国国内就变成了不吉的名称。在两党的竞选中，凡是与它有点关系的，都唯恐不及地推脱和它的纠葛，只要能充反对派，就尽量加以攻击。像参院外交委员会主席康纳利这样老牌的民主党分子，在最后决定放弃竞选野心之前，一度竟也成了杜鲁门政策的尖刻的批评者，而艾森豪威尔虽然实际上是杜鲁门的对外扩张和备战政策的支持者和执行人，却在返国后第一次记者招待会上着重申明自己“从未参预政府事务，因此没有参预过美国的整个外交政策”，后来并且一口否认杜鲁门曾和他商量民主党候选人提名的事情。各方面对于杜鲁门政策的不满到了这样的程度，以至在民主党内部形成了反对杜鲁门的公开运动，有势力的南方民主党首领们甚至宣布，如果杜鲁门出任民主党候选人，他们将宁愿让共和党上台。
    由于民主党竞选中迄今的消沉局面，一般的注意力都集中在共和党方面。在这里，塔夫脱和艾森豪威尔各在预选中搜罗了为取得最后提名所需的代表票数的三分之二上下，正展开激烈的竞争。塔夫脱和艾森豪威尔主要的争论集中在外交政策以及相连的国内措施上。他们在这方面所发表的竞选言论充分地反映了美国统治集团内部混乱矛盾和找不到出路的状况。
    代表统治集团中比较现实地看到美国的失败以及美国力量不足以完成目前规模的全球扩张计划的事实的一派，塔夫脱要求改变杜鲁门政府的现行侵略政策，主张结束在朝鲜的“无结果的战争”，削减已过于庞大的预算，不要在西欧担负过多的财政及军事责任，而集中力量于建立空军，作为恫吓性外交的手段，并伺机对苏联及人民民主国家进行袭击。关于这个侵略政策的最终目的，塔夫脱在六月
    一日的一次外交政策演说中说得很清楚：一等到国内动员工作做好，“我们就可以再出发进行一次十字军远征，把个人自由的教义传布到全世界。”他坚决否认自己是孤立主义者，但他承认美国目前这种过度的伸展会招致破产。朝鲜战争中的失败使他得出结论，要在大陆上战胜和平民主阵营是不可能的。为了推脱共和党在战后美国的一切重大的对外扩张上支持了杜鲁门政府的破产政策的责任，塔夫脱现在强调在外交上并不存在所谓“两党”政策。他还形容杜鲁门—艾奇逊的外交是美国历史上“最具灾难性的”。原来支持杜鲁门出兵朝鲜的这位共和党首领现在说他已经“改变了看法”，现在他认为那是一个“错误”了。这种不得不承认美国失败而又竭力想把自己扮成是美国破产的现行侵略政策的反对者的企图，使塔夫脱常常自相矛盾。连美国的“时代”杂志也说他在反对杜鲁门的努力中，发表“时常令人迷惑”的谈话，“听起来自相矛盾”。
    另一方面，艾森豪威尔承认美国统治集团内部“不团结”是一个“威胁”（六月四日在阿比兰的演说—“新闻周刊”六月十六日）。他痛骂塔夫脱是“无知和不负责任的人”，说他的主张是“愚蠢、浅见”的孤立主义主张，只会“自招毁灭”（六月二十三日在丹佛发表的演说—合众社二十三日电）。艾森豪威尔坚持必须继续所谓“集体安全”的政策和建立“实力”，因此他竭力反对大量削减军备开支（包括所谓“军事援助”）。他又表示，如果他当了总统，就要削减捐税四百亿美元。他没有说明，既然他主张继续庞大的军备计划，如何能这样大量削减捐税。这种纯粹着眼于选举的政治把戏的欺骗性质是如此明显，以至连杜鲁门在格鲁顿所作的演说也评论说这是一个“想上台的人”做出来的“可笑的事情”（美联社六月十四日电）。杜鲁门在六月二十日的记者招待会上并且说，没有一个民主党或共和党的总统能够做到这样的削减。事实上，美国政府目前财政赤字已经年达七八十亿美元。在朝鲜问题上，艾森豪威尔反对塔夫脱的方案，而主张“撑下去”，但又不得不承认他也并“没有任何取得决定性结果的药方”（六月十六日“时代”杂志）。像塔夫脱一样，艾森豪威尔在竞选中也使自己陷于明显的自相矛盾的地位。艾森豪威尔为了表明自己是和民主党政府没有瓜葛的道地共和党人，他六月五日在阿比兰招待记者会上曾声明他的“政治哲学”的基础就是共和党国会议员及全国委员会在一九五零年二月联合发表的宣言。而这个宣言正是艾森豪威尔所竭力攻击的“孤立主义者”塔夫脱起草的。这样，艾森豪威尔的后台老板之一鲁斯的杂志“时代”对于他的成就不禁颇表失望，认为他回国以来并未能造成他的支持者原来期望于他的“爆炸”式影响。六月二十三日的“时代”杂志分析原因时指出说：“他迄今最大的失败是缺乏一个切实的、前瞻的纲领。”
    美国两党竞选运动所表现的上述特点以及“时代”杂志的抱怨说明，朝鲜战争两年后的美国统治集团已陷入无可救药的矛盾和混乱境地。
