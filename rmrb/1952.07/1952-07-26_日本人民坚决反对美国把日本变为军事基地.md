    The Japanese People Resolutely Oppose the United States Turning Japan into a Military Base
    Since the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement," the U.S. troops stationed in Japan have been more frantically carrying out war preparations in Japan. This is particularly evident in the U.S.'s accelerating efforts to turn Japanese territory into its military base. According to the so-called "Administrative Agreement," the U.S. has already occupied 16 major air force bases and 39 major military training grounds in Japan. Recently, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, Japan's "supreme government," even made a preliminary decision that the U.S. will build an air force base near Nara, the famous ancient capital of Japan with precious cultural relics and historic sites. U.S. troops stationed in Japan also announced that they would hold their first post-war air defense exercise in Japan for three days starting July 21.
    From this, people can see that the war policy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries not only puts the Japanese people in a state of economic poverty and political humiliation and powerlessness, but also the various arrogant military measures that come with the war preparations plan are directly disrupting the peaceful life of the Japanese people and are seriously endangering the cultural heritage of the Japanese nation.
    The U.S. aggressors keep saying that they are "protecting" Japan, but the Japanese people and all honest people know that the U.S.'s "protection" is precisely a synonym for "aggression" and "destruction." While forcing the Japanese people to conduct air defense exercises, the U.S. shamelessly uses the excuse of "defending against hypothetical enemies." But the Japanese people know deeply that their mortal enemies are none other than the U.S. robbers and the Japanese traitorous government.
    The Japanese people have national self-esteem, and they strongly oppose the barbarous acts of alien aggressors – U.S. imperialism – trampling on their motherland's land and destroying the Japanese nation's cultural relics and historic sites. The Japan Electrical Communication Workers' Union, which held a national congress in Nara City, passed a resolution resolutely opposing the U.S. turning Japan into a military base. Due to the anger of the Japanese people, the traitorous Yoshida government had no choice but to announce in the Diet that "no air force base will be built in Nara." The Japanese people have expressed extreme contempt and strong resistance to the U.S. military's air defense exercise orders, causing the U.S. military's air defense exercise to be declared a failure. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. turning their territory into a military base is developing and has achieved initial victories. This just struggle of the Japanese people has struck a blow to the U.S.'s war preparations plan and has been admired and supported by peace-loving people of all countries.

### 日本人民坚决反对美国把日本变为军事基地

    日本人民坚决反对美国把日本变为军事基地
    自单独对日和约、美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”生效后，驻日美军更加疯狂地在日本进行战争准备，这特别表现在美国正在加紧把日本国土变为它的军事基地。美国根据所谓“行政协定”，已在日本占有主要空军基地十六处，占有主要军事演习场三十九处。最近日本“太上政府”——美日联合委员会竟作出初步决定，美国将在著名的、有着珍贵文物古迹的日本故都奈良附近修建空军基地。驻日美军又宣布七月二十一日起，在日本举行战后第一次防空大演习三天。
    人们由此可以看到，美日反动派的战争政策不但使日本人民陷于经济上贫困、政治上屈辱无权的境地；而且随着备战计划而来的种种蛮横的军事措施，正在直接破坏着日本人民的和平生活，并正在严重地危害着日本民族的文化遗产。
    美国侵略者口口声声说他们是在“保护”日本，但是日本人民和一切正直的人们都知道，美国的
    “保护”恰恰是“侵略”和“破坏”的代名词。美军在强迫日本人民举行防空演习时，又无耻地藉口要“防御假想的敌人”。但是日本人民深深知道，他们的死敌不是别人，正是美国强盗和日本卖国政府。
    日本人民是有民族自尊心的，他们强烈反对异族侵略者——美帝国主义蹂躏自己祖国土地，破坏日本民族文化古迹的野蛮行为。在奈良市举行全国代表大会的日本电气通信省工会，就曾经通过决议，坚决反对美国把日本军事基地化。由于日本人民的愤怒，迫使卖国的吉田政府也不得不在国会中宣布“不在奈良建筑空军基地。”日本人民对美军的防空演习的指令更表示了极端藐视和强烈反抗，使美军的防空演习宣告失败。日本人民反对美国把自己国土变为军事基地的斗争正在发展并取得了初步的胜利。日本人民的这一正义斗争打击了美国的备战计划，受到各国爱好和平人民的敬佩和支持。
