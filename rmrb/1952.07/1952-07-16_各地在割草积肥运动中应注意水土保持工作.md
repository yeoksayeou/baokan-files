    To the Editor: Recently, various regions in Jiangxi Province have enthusiastically launched a campaign to apply topdressing fertilizer and accumulate manure, achieving great results. However, some deviations have also occurred in this movement. That is, many areas have taken mobilizing the masses to "go up the mountains to shovel sod" as a main method of accumulating manure, resulting in these forests losing their soil and water conservation function and damaging the mountains. The second page of the May 24th Jiangxi Daily published two articles, "Yongxin and 17 Other Counties Launch Manure Accumulation Campaign" and "Yongxin County Mobilizes the Entire County to Increase Manure Accumulation by 500 Million Jin: Experience." From these two articles, this situation can be seen. The former article stated: "The methods of accumulating manure in various places include sweeping garbage, shoveling sod, and cutting leaves, the so-called 'sweeping, shoveling, and cutting clean' method. In Wucun Township, Jinrui District, Yichun County, more than 200 people go up the mountain every day to shovel sod and cut wild soybean seedlings, cleaning up a six-mile-long mountain behind the second group of the township. After Worang Township, Ninggang County, implemented the 'three cleans' method, it accumulated more than 920,000 jin of fertilizer in two days." I believe that this is a short-sighted approach that outweighs the gains, which will cause serious soil erosion and bring endless disasters to agricultural production. Therefore, I suggest:
    (1) We should do a good job in closing hillsides for afforestation and soil and water conservation, and we should widely and deeply carry out publicity and education on closing hillsides for afforestation.
    (2) The phenomenon of "shoveling sod on the mountains" and "cutting green" in a bald-headed manner should be corrected from top to bottom in a timely manner. However, for the purpose of accumulating fertilizer, "grass cutting" and "green cutting" can be carried out in a planned way, and attention should be paid to retaining young trees for closing hillsides for afforestation. In areas where soil erosion is serious, it is absolutely forbidden to go up the mountains to "shovel grass" and "cut green".

### 各地在割草积肥运动中应注意水土保持工作

    各地在割草积肥运动中应注意水土保持工作
    编辑同志：最近江西省各地热烈展开了施追肥和积肥运动，获得了很大的成绩。但是，在这个运动里，也发生了一些偏差。这就是许多地区把发动群众“上山铲草皮”作为积肥的一种主要办法，结果使这些山林失去了水土保持的作用，破坏了山林。五月二十四日江西日报第二版登载了“永新等十八县开展积肥运动”和“永新县发动全县群众增积五亿斤肥料的经验”两篇文章，从这两篇文章中，就可以看出这种情况。前一篇文章说：“各地积肥的办法除打扫垃圾之外，还有铲草皮、割树叶等，所谓扫、铲、割“三光”的办法。宜春县金瑞区洖村乡每天有二百多人上山铲草皮、割野豆苗，把该乡二组背后一座六里长的大山铲净。宁冈县沃壤乡实行“三光”办法后，两天积了九十二万多斤肥料。”我认为这是一种不顾长远利益的得不偿失的做法，这将引起严重的土壤被冲刷的后果，给农业生产带来无穷的灾害。因此，我建议：
    （一）应做好封山育林和水土保持工作，并应广泛深入开展封山育林的宣传教育。
    （二）应由上而下地及时纠正“上山铲草皮”及剃光头式的“割青”现象。但为了积肥，可以有计划地“割草”“割青”，同时应注意保留幼树，以便封山育林。在土壤被冲刷严重的地区，应绝对禁止上山“铲草”“割青”。        吴述綮
