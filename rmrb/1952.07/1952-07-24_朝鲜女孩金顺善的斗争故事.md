    In 1950, Kim Sun-sil was just a 14-year-old girl. In October, when the American invading army frantically advanced north, her father and mother joined the struggle to defend the country, and her two older brothers also joined the People's Army, fighting the American invaders on the front lines. Little Kim, who loved her country, joined the guerrilla forces and waged a heroic struggle against the enemy on the shores of Changjin Lake.

    The first time Little Kim carried out a reconnaissance mission, she was captured by the enemy. The enemy took her with their troops, all the way to Gantuli, a large village in Fengshan County. As soon as the enemy entered the village, they busied themselves with looting and raping. The clever Little Kim took the opportunity to escape into the home of a man surnamed Li. This family consisted of only two kind old people, who took Little Kim in.

    That evening, Little Kim went to the mountains to collect firewood and encountered three reconnaissance men from the People's Army. They were carrying two automatic rifles and wanted to wage guerrilla warfare here. Reconnaissance man Kim Yun-chun told Little Kim not to return to the guerrilla forces for the time being, but to stay here and work with them. So, Little Kim took them back to the village and hid them in a cellar behind the house.

    The four local despotic landlords established a reactionary "security team" that tortured and slaughtered patriotic people every day. After Kim Yun-chun learned of this, he asked Little Kim to find a way to determine the style of the enemy's armband and make three of them in the same way. Little Kim accepted this task, and every time she passed in front of the "security team" gate while fetching water and chopping firewood, she secretly paid attention to the armband of the guard. After clearly seeing the appearance of the armband, she cut off a white skirt, asked Grandpa Li, the homeowner, for half a stick of ink and a writing brush, and pretended to make a "national flag" for the Li Seung-man gang and asked the "security team" for some red ink. Soon, Kim Yun-chun and the others wore the armbands made by Little Kim.

    The next day, before dawn, Kim Yun-chun and the other two, wearing armbands, stormed into the security team headquarters in a menacing manner. They said they were from the county to inspect the work, and loudly asked how many people had been killed here, and then ordered the security captain to "execute" the eight captured patriots under their supervision. The captain was stunned by them and quickly ordered the security team members to bring the eight "prisoners." Before long, Kim Yun-chun and the other two took four security team members and eight patriots quickly towards the mountains behind the village in the crowing of chickens.

    Kim Yun-chun and the others killed the four bandits on the mountain and rescued eight comrades. They put on the clothes of the four bandits and wore the real "security team" armbands, and openly carried out activities in the village. From then on, strange things that frightened the enemy happened every day: American soldiers or Li's puppet troops were suddenly killed, American cars often disappeared, or suddenly exploded. Later, the enemy tightened their defenses and checked household registrations several times a day. Kim Yun-chun and the others felt that the situation was too tense, so they decided to leave this place. Before leaving, they encouraged Little Kim to continue the struggle cautiously.

    However, as soon as Kim Yun-chun and the others left, Little Kim was captured by the enemy. The enemy hoped to find out some information about Kim Yun-chun and the others from Little Kim, so they decided to send her to a high-level agency in Hungnam for interrogation. Hungnam was a killing field for the American invaders. Anyone sent here had little chance of survival.

    One day, two ten-wheel trucks came from outside, crowded with People's Army soldiers, guerrilla fighters, and local cadres whose hands were tied. They were all to be sent to Hungnam. Little Kim was also taken onto the truck. Behind them, another truck carried more than twenty American soldiers and Li's puppet soldiers escorting the "prisoners." When the truck drove to Babari, more than twenty miles from Gantuli, it was already late and the weather was very cold. The American soldiers went into the village to rest, and the Li's puppet soldiers were unwilling to stay in the cold wind to guard these "prisoners." A Li's puppet army officer handed a whistle to Little Kim and threatened her, "Watch them for me! If they move around, you blow the whistle. If you don't blow it, we'll kill you!" Little Kim agreed, but as soon as the Li's puppet soldiers went into the village, she immediately climbed onto the truck and used her teeth to bite off the rope on one person's hands. The person who was untied immediately untied the ropes for the others. Soon, everyone on the first truck was able to move their hands. At this time, Little Kim said, "Comrades, go!" A wounded People's Army soldier anxiously asked, "What about you?" Little Kim waved her hand and said, "Go quickly, don't worry about me!" So more than fifty people jumped off the truck and ran towards the mountains to the west in different directions. After Little Kim jumped out of the truck, she climbed onto the second truck. Just as she untied the rope of one person, the enemy discovered it and immediately opened fire. Several people on the second truck were killed by bullets. The brave Little Kim continued to save people until the enemy was still more than fifty meters away from the truck, when she jumped off the truck and ran away.

    The enemy chased Little Kim closely behind. Bullets pierced three holes in her skirt. She climbed a high mountain and hid in the woods, finally escaping danger. She walked aimlessly in the woods all night. At dawn, she realized that she had returned to Gantuli. Little Kim thought that the enemy stationed in the village now did not know her, so she returned to the Li's house. Unexpectedly, that night, the enemy searched everywhere, and they questioned Little Kim twice. In the middle of the night, just as Little Kim was trying to escape, the enemy came again and captured her.

    Little Kim was sent from Gantuli to Babari again. The enemy in Babari was in a frenzy over the escape of the "prisoners." When they saw Little Kim, they were furious and slapped her twice, causing her mouth to fill with blood. The enemy tied her tightly with a thick rope and threw her into the corner of the room where the American officer lived. In this serious situation, the spirit of the Soviet heroines Zoya and Marite who sacrificed for their country encouraged her. She made up her mind: never to succumb to the enemy.

    December 20th, it was snowing heavily. An American officer brought a translator and a Li's puppet army officer to interrogate her. Little Kim said nothing. The next day, the enemy questioned her from morning until noon, but still got nothing. Little Kim proudly told the enemy, "I don't know! Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you!" The American officer went crazy and ordered the Li's puppet army officer to beat her desperately and twist her hair. Little Kim fainted from the pain and was awakened with cold water. The enemy interrogated her for two consecutive days, using all kinds of torture, including beatings, needle pricks, hair twisting, cold water drenching, and stripping her naked and freezing her on the snow… Little Kim was tortured all over, but still said nothing. Finally, the enemy decided to use execution to threaten her.

    On December 24th, heavy snow covered the fields and villages. The enemy forced more than a hundred women, children and old people to the village square with bayonets, then let Little Kim wear a thin coat, tied her with a rope and dragged her to the square. The Li's puppet army officer announced Little Kim's "crimes" and sentence. Many villagers shed tears. Little Kim stood unyielding and stern. The enemy asked her if she had any last words. She took two steps forward and said to everyone with a young but stubborn voice, "Don't be sad! You shouldn't shed tears in front of the enemy! It doesn't matter if a child like me dies, there are still 30 million people in the country who will fight the enemy. We will not give in. The motherland will surely win!" The villagers were moved to tears, but no one lowered their heads. Little Kim turned around and sternly cursed at the enemy, "You are dogs, you are beasts! One day, you will be killed!"

    The threat of death did not make Little Kim succumb. The enemy's conspiracy failed again, but the enemy did not plan to execute her immediately, but dragged her back and locked her up, preparing to torture her slowly.

    On the 26th, thunderous artillery fire came from the north. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers victoriously launched a counterattack to the south. MacArthur ordered his troops to retreat quickly. The enemy in Babari decided to execute all sixty-nine Korean patriots who had not yet been killed before fleeing.

    That night, sixty-nine patriots were dragged to the snow outside the village. Hundreds of martyrs' bodies already lay here. The enemy divided them into groups of ten, each group executed by a soldier with an automatic rifle. Little Kim was in the last group of nine people. With a burst of gunfire, the patriots heroically sacrificed one by one in the shouts of "Long live General Kim Il-sung." After each executioner killed the group of people assigned to him, they hurriedly fled. Finally, only Little Kim and the other eight people and one Li's puppet soldier were left on the snow. The soldier looked around and saw that there was no one else, so he fired a row of shots into the sky with an automatic rifle. The nine people immediately pretended to be dead and fell down. The soldier hurriedly returned to the village.

    After the enemy fled, Little Kim and the others went to the home of a villager in a mountain gully. The old man of this family treated them like his own children. Soon, his son, the local Labor Party committee chairman, returned with a gun on his back. When he saw Little Kim, he picked her up, looked at her intently, and tears welled up in his eyes. Little Kim felt a little confused. The committee chairman said affectionately, "Yes, you can't remember everyone, because you saved too many people!" This reminded Little Kim. It turned out that he was the last person Little Kim saved on the second truck at the risk of her life. She also excitedly hugged the committee chairman, shedding tears of excitement for a long time.

    The heroic Korean people defeated the enemy with their unyielding struggle, and Little Kim's deeds have spread throughout the country. She was sent to Pyongyang and awarded the "Military Service Medal" by the Republic government.

    At the end of March this year, she was sent by the Republic government to the Kim Jong-suk Women's Technical College for children of patriotic martyrs. This young girl, who had once waged an unyielding struggle against the enemy, is now studying hard, determined to train herself into an excellent technical talent, so that she can better serve the motherland in the future.

    朝鲜女孩金顺善的斗争故事
    新华社记者  戴煌
    一九五零年，金顺善还是一个十四岁的女孩子。美国侵略军在十月间疯狂北犯，她的父亲和母亲参加了保卫祖国的斗争，两个哥哥也参加了人民军，在前线和美国侵略者作战。热爱祖国的小金就参加了游击队，在长津湖畔和敌人展开英勇的斗争。
    小金第一次执行侦察任务时，就被敌人捉住了。敌人把她带在部队中，一直走到丰山郡的大村庄甘土里。敌人一进村子，就忙着抢掠、奸淫。聪明的小金就趁这机会逃进一家姓李的人家。这家只有两位善良的老人家，他们收养了小金。
    当天晚上，小金到山上去打柴，碰到人民军的三个侦察员，他们带着两枝自动枪，要在这里打游击。侦察员金允春告诉小金暂时不要回游击队，留在这里和他们一起活动。于是，小金就把他们带回村庄，藏在屋后的地洞内。
    当地的四个恶霸地主成立了反动的“治安队”，每天拷打和屠杀爱国志士。金允春知道后，要小金想法查明敌人的臂章式样，并照样做三个。小金领受了这个任务，在每次打水砍柴路过“治安队”门前时，就偷偷地注意卫兵的臂章。看清楚臂章的样子后，她剪去了自己的一条白裙子，向房主李大爷要了半截墨和一枝毛笔，又假装要做李承晚匪帮的
    “国旗”，向“治安队”要了些红墨水。不久，金允春他们就戴上了小金做的臂章。
    第二天天还没有亮，金允春等三个人就戴着臂章，气势汹汹地闯进治安队队部。他们说自己是从郡里来检查工作的，并且大声喝问这里杀了多少人，接着又命令治安队长把捉住的八个爱国志士在他们的监督之下“枪毙”。那个队长被他们吓呆了，连忙叫治安队员把八个“囚犯”带来。不一会，金允春他们三个人就带着四个治安队员和八个爱国志士在鸡叫声中向村后的山上迅速走去。
    金允春他们就在山上杀死了这四个匪徒，救出了八个同志。他们穿上了四个匪徒的衣服，并且戴上了真正是“治安队”的臂章，在村子里公开活动起来。从此，每天都发生使敌胆寒的怪事：美国兵或李匪军忽然被人杀死，美国人的汽车常常失踪，或者突然爆炸起来。后来敌人的防备加紧了，每天几次检查户口。金允春他们觉得风声太紧，就决定离开此地。临走时，他们鼓励小金要谨慎地继续进行斗争。
    可是，金允春他们一走，小金就被敌人捉去了。敌人希望从小金口中问出些关于金允春他们的一些情况来，所以决定把她送到在兴南的高级机关去审问。兴南是美国侵略者的一个杀人屠场，凡是被送到这里来的人，都是九死一生的。
    一天，外面来了两辆十轮卡车，上面挤满了双手被绑着的人民军战士、游击队员和地方干部，他们都是要被送到兴南去的。小金也被押上了卡车。在他们后面的一辆卡车上载着二十多个押送“犯人”的美国兵和李伪军。车子开到离甘土里二十多里的巴巴里时，天已晚了，而且气候非常冷。美国兵进村休息去了，李匪军也不愿留在冷风中来看守这些
    “囚犯”。一个李伪军军官将一个哨子交给小金，并且威吓她说：“替我看着！他们如果乱动，你就吹哨子，如果不吹，我们就打死你！”小金答应了，但等李伪军一走进村子，她马上爬上车子，用牙齿咬断了一个人手上的绳子，被解开的人又立即替别的人解绳子，很快，第一辆车上所有的人手都能活动了。这时小金说：“同志们，你们走吧！”一个负了伤的人民军战士焦急地问：“你怎么办？”小金挥手说：“你们快走，不要管我！”于是五十多个人纷纷跳下车子，分头向西面的山上跑去。小金跳下车后，又接着向第二辆车上爬去，刚解开一个人的绳子，敌人就发觉了，立即开枪射击，第二辆车上有几个人中弹牺牲了。勇敢的小金这时仍继续在救人，直到敌人离卡车还有五十多公尺时，她才跳下车子飞跑。
    敌人在后面紧紧地追着小金，子弹将她的裙子打穿了三个洞。她爬上一座高山，钻进了树林，才脱了险。她在树林中漫无目的地走了一夜，天亮时，她才发觉自己又回到了甘土里。小金以为现在驻在村里的敌人不认识她，所以又回到了李家。不料当天晚上，敌人就到处追查，他们盘问了小金两次。半夜里，小金正要设法逃走，敌人又来了，把她捉了去。
    小金又被从甘土里送到巴巴里。巴巴里的敌人正在为“囚犯”逃走的事急得团团转，一见小金就暴跳如雷，狠狠地打了她两个耳光，把她打得满嘴鲜血，敌人又用一条粗绳把她捆得结结实实，丢到美国军官所住屋子的角落里。在这样严重的情况下，苏联女英雄卓娅和马丽黛为祖国而牺牲的精神鼓舞了她，她下了决心：决不向敌人屈服。
    十二月二十日，天下着大雪。一个美国军官带了一个翻译和一个李匪军官来审问她。小金什么也不说。第二天，敌人又从早晨一直问到中午，仍旧什么也没有得到，小金傲然地告诉敌人：“不知道！就是知道，也不告诉你们！”美国军官发疯了，命令李匪军官拚命地打她，并且绞她的头发。小金痛昏过去，又被用冷水激醒。敌人接连审问了两天，对她用尽了拷打、针刺、绞头发、灌冷水、脱光了衣服放在雪地上冻等等毒刑……。小金被折磨得遍体鳞伤，但还是什么也不讲。最后，敌人决定用枪毙来威吓她。
    十二月二十四日，大雪覆盖了地野和村庄。敌人用刺刀将一百多个妇女、小孩和老人逼到村中的广场上，然后让小金穿了一套单衣，用绳子拉着绑到场上。李匪军军官宣布了小金的“罪状”和判决书，许多老乡都流下了眼泪。小金不屈地、严峻地站着。敌人问她有什么遗言，她向前跨了两步，用年幼的、但十分倔强的声音激动地向大家说：“你们不要难过！在敌人的面前，不应该流泪！我一个小孩子死了不要紧，还有全国三千万人民会和敌人斗争下去。我们是不会屈服的。祖国一定胜利！”老乡们被她感动得哭了起来，但是没有一个人低下头去。小金转回身来凛然对着敌人骂道：“你们是狗，是野兽！总有一天，你们会被打死的！”
    死亡的威胁并没有使小金屈服，敌人的阴谋又一次失败了，但是敌人还不打算马上枪毙她，又把她拉回去关了起来，准备慢慢地折磨她。
    二十六日，北方传来了隆隆的炮声。英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军胜利地向南反攻了。麦克阿瑟命令他的部队赶快撤退，巴巴里的敌人决定在逃跑以前把还没有杀掉的六十九个朝鲜爱国志士一齐枪毙。
    当天晚上，六十九个爱国志士被拉到村外的雪地上。这里已躺着数百个烈士的尸体。敌人把他们每十个人分成一组，每组由一个士兵用自动枪执行枪决。小金排在最后的九个人中。随着一阵枪声，爱国志士们一个个地在“金日成将军万岁”的喊声中壮烈牺牲了。每一个刽子手杀死了分配给他的一组人以后，都急急忙忙地逃走了。最后，雪地上只剩下小金等九个人和一个李伪军士兵了。这个士兵看看四周已没有别的人，就用自动枪向天空放了一排枪，九个人马上装死倒下，那个士兵就慌忙地回到村里去了。
    敌人逃走后，小金等就走到一个山沟中的老乡家里。这家的老大爷像对待亲生儿女一样地招待他们。不久他的儿子当地劳动党的委员长背着枪回来了。他一见小金，就把她抱起来，目不转睛地望着她，眼泪夺眶而出。小金感到有些迷惘，这位委员长深情地说：“是的，你不会记清每个人的，因为你救的人太多了！”这一下提醒了小金，原来他就是小金在第二辆卡车上拚着命救出来的最后一个人。她也兴奋地抱着委员长，久久地淌着激动的热泪。
    英勇的朝鲜人民用不屈的斗争战胜了敌人，小金的事迹已传遍了全国。她被送到平壤，荣获了共和国政府颁发的“军功章”。
    今年三月底，她被共和国政府送进朝鲜爱国烈士遗子女金正淑女子技术学院。这个年轻的、曾经和敌人作过不屈斗争的姑娘，现在正刻苦地学习着，决心把自己锻炼成一个优秀的技术人才，在将来更好地为祖国服务。
