    Chinese Catholics Oppose U.S. Germ Warfare

    We, Catholics in New China who enjoy freedom and happiness, based on the conscience of religious believers, lodge a serious protest against the germ warfare carried out by American aggressors in Korea and China, which violates international conventions and human morality. The germ warfare carried out by the American aggressors, after investigation by Chinese and foreign personnel and research by scientific experts, has been proven to be an undeniable fact. Just to cite the following two examples: (1) Reverend Wang Zizhong of the Beijing Congregational Church, a representative of our religious community, participated in the investigation and went to the front lines and rear areas of Korea and various parts of the Northeast. He personally heard the accusations of local residents in China and Korea and personally saw the various germ-carrying insects and the shells containing these insects dropped by American planes. (2) American Air Force prisoners of war Quinn and Enoch, due to the dictates of their conscience, provided confessions about their personal experiences of being ordered to drop germ bombs, further confirming that the germ warfare waged by American aggressors against the Chinese and Korean people was a planned and premeditated action.

    The American aggressors claim to be "Christians" and call themselves "defenders of Christian civilization." However, the facts tell us that the American aggression against Korea, especially the barbaric crime of germ warfare that harmed the peaceful residents of China and Korea, is a complete violation of Christian doctrine and morality, a violation of Christian humanitarianism and the spirit of love, and a desecration of the Gospel of Peace that Christ preached of serving others.

    We are patriotic, religious, and peace-loving Chinese Catholics. Based on Christian doctrine and the conscience of believers, we protest against the American aggressors for conducting germ warfare. For the sake of human dignity and justice, for the sake of world peace, and for the sake of the Gospel of Christ, we support the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons. We want to appeal to Catholics around the world and all peace-loving and just people to unite and stop the American aggressors from committing the crime of germ warfare.

    我国天主教徒反对美国细菌战宣言
    我们在新中国享着自由幸福的天主教徒，本着宗教徒的良心，对于美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国所进行的违犯国际公约和违反人类道德的细菌战，提出严重的抗议。美国侵略者所进行的细菌战，经过中外人士的调查和科学专家的研究，已经证明是一个千真万确无可否认的事实。只举以下两件事为例：（一）我宗教界代表北京公理会王梓仲牧师曾经参加调查工作，到过朝鲜前线和后方以及东北各地，他曾亲耳听到中朝当地居民的控诉，亲眼看到美国飞机撒布的各种带细菌的昆虫和装置这种昆虫的弹壳。（二）美国空军战俘奎恩和伊纳克两人，由于受到良心的责备，提出了他们本人奉命投掷细菌弹经过的供词，更证实了美国侵略者对中朝人民进行的细菌战是有计划有预谋的行动。
    美国侵略者自命为“基督徒”，自称为“保卫基督教的文明”，然而事实告诉我们，美国侵略朝鲜的残暴罪行，特别是残害中朝两国和平居民的细菌战，是完全违反基督的教义和道德，违反基督的人道主义和博爱精神，亵渎了基督所宣扬的为人服务的和平福音的。
    我们是爱国爱教和爱好和平的中国天主教徒，本着基督的教义，本着教徒的良心，我们抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战。为了人类的尊严和正义，为了世界的和平，为了基督的福音，我们赞成禁止使用细菌武器。我们要向全世界的天主教徒和一切爱好和平正义的人民呼吁，一致团结起来，制止美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。
