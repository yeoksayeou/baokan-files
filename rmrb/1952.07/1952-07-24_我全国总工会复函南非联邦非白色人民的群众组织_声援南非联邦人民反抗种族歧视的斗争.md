Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The joint secretaries of the National Action Committee of the African National Congress of the Union of South Africa and the South African Indian Congress, Sisulu and Gathalia, wrote to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on June 18th, reporting on the progress of the movement of ten million non-white people in the Union of South Africa against the authorities' discrimination and oppression, and requesting that this situation be widely disseminated. The communique on the resistance movement attached to the letter stated: On April 6th of this year, the 300th anniversary of the imperialists' invasion of South Africa, more than 100,000 people held rallies across the Union of South Africa, launching a movement against unjust racial discrimination laws. In order to suppress this movement, the government of the Union of South Africa ordered the chairman of the South African Indian Congress, Dadoo, the member of the Executive Committee of the African National Congress, Kotane, the chairman of the Transvaal Province branch of the African National Congress, Max, and the secretary, Popap, to be banned from participating in any political activities, and ordered them to leave their current positions. However, the people of South Africa did not yield. The African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress convened a joint meeting of the Executive Committees on May 21st, deciding to appeal to Dadoo and others to resist the government's fascist ban, and established a National Action Committee to guide the people in carrying out an organized struggle, resolutely resisting unjust racial discrimination laws. Subsequently, the government of the Union of South Africa barbarously arrested and imprisoned these four leaders of the South African people. This atrocity aroused the anger of the South African people, who designated June 26th as the day for the start of an organized resistance movement. On this day, people in all centers of the Union of South Africa took action to fight against unjust laws. The communique of the National Action Committee of the African National Congress of the Union of South Africa and the South African Indian Congress pointed out: "This day is an important turning point in the history of the non-European people of South Africa."
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has already written back to the joint secretaries of this organization, Sisulu and Gathalia, on July 21st, to support their struggle, and has, according to their suggestion, copied their letter and communique to various Chinese people's organizations and relevant departments for wide dissemination. The letter from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: "The Chinese working people have always deeply sympathized with and closely cared about the just struggle of the non-white people of South Africa against the racial discrimination policy of the Malan government. The Chinese working class expresses serious protest against the fascist measures of the Malan government in flagrantly arresting Dr. Dadoo, Mr. Max, Mr. Kotane, Mr. Popap and other democratic elements, and demands their immediate and unconditional release." The letter concluded: "We believe that your united struggle against the imperialist policy of enslavement will surely achieve final victory."

    我全国总工会复函南非联邦非白色人民的群众组织
    声援南非联邦人民反抗种族歧视的斗争
    【新华社二十三日讯】南非联邦非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会联合书记西苏鲁和加查里亚在六月十八日写信给中华全国总工会，报告南非联邦一千万非白色人民反抗当局歧视和压迫的运动开展的情况，并且请求把这种情况广为传播。随这封信附上的关于反抗运动的公报说：今年四月六日，也就是帝国主义者侵入南非三百周年纪念日，南非联邦全国各地有十万人以上举行了集会，展开了反抗不公正的种族歧视法令的运动。南非联邦政府为了镇压这个运动，就下令禁止南非印度人大会主席达杜、非洲人国民大会执行委员会委员柯吞、非洲人国民大会川斯伐尔省分会主席麦克斯和书记波帕朴参加任何政治活动，并勒令他们离开现职。但是南非人民并没有屈服，非洲人国民大会和南非印度人大会在五月二十一日召开了执行委员会联席会议，决定吁请达杜等抵制政府的法西斯禁令，并且成立了全国行动委员会，指导人民进行有组织的斗争，坚决反抗不公正的种族歧视法令。随后南非联邦政府竟野蛮地逮捕了并监禁了南非人民的这四个领袖。这种暴行激起了南非人民的愤怒，他们把六月二十六日定为有组织的反抗运动开始的日子。在这一天，南非联邦全国各中心的人民都行动起来，为反抗不公正的法令而斗争。南非联邦非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会的公报指出：“这一天是南非的非欧洲人民历史上一个重要的转折点。”
    中华全国总工会已经在七月二十一日写回信给这个组织的联合书记西苏鲁和加查里亚，声援他们的斗争，并且按照他们的建议把他们的来信和公报抄送中国各人民团体，和有关机关，以广为传播。中华全国总工会的信说：“中国劳动人民始终深切同情并且密切关怀着南非的非白色人民反抗马兰政府种族歧视政策的正义斗争。中国工人阶级对于马兰政府悍然逮捕达杜博士、麦克斯先生、柯吞先生、波帕朴先生及其他民主分子的法西斯措施提出严重抗议，并且要求立刻无条件释放他们。”信上最后说：“我们相信你们团结一致反对帝国主义奴役政策的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。”
