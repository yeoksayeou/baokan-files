Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: The Japanese people's widespread movement against joining the "Police Reserve Force" and against conscription has severely打击ed the Yoshida government's plan to establish an American mercenary army.

    In the early days of the "Police Reserve Force," the desolate Japanese countryside was one of the main sources for the US-Japanese reactionaries to collect cannon fodder. However, today the movement against joining the "Police Reserve Force" has penetrated into the countryside. For example, in Nagano Prefecture, the youth league of Toyosawa Village resolved that all members would never join the "Police Reserve Force." The women's department of the labor union of Suwa Radio Station in Kataoka Village in the same prefecture invited the fathers and elder brothers of those with children in the "Reserve Force" from nearby villages to a report meeting, calling on them not to let their children join the "Police Reserve Force" again.

    Recently, when the "Police Reserve Force" recruited new members, the people in various places showed their determination to refuse to serve as American cannon fodder. In the village of Kotomari, Kitatsugaru, Aomori Prefecture, after receiving the recruitment brochures distributed by the village government, the people were filled with anger. The young people burned the brochures and accused the village government of becoming the Yoshida government's conscription section, which finally forced the village chief to admit his mistake.

    In order to make up for the recruitment shortfall, the Yoshida government openly dispatched former "Reserve Force" members to their hometowns to lure young people into joining the "Reserve Force" by means of enticement, and in some places even sent "Reserve Force" bands to promote it. However, this conspiracy also failed, and the number of applicants was still very small. In Murayama, Yamagata Prefecture, the number of applicants was less than one-third of the previous time. Sakata City and Bokkaishi originally planned to recruit 300 people, but in reality only 32 people signed up. The number of applicants in the Okitama area of Yonezawa City was only one-tenth of the previous time. When the jeeps of the "Reserve Force" parked in front of local hotels, the masses wrote slogans such as "Don't be an American mercenary! Americans go home!" on the vehicles.

    After the Yoshida government's plan to expand the "Police Reserve Force" through recruitment was挫败ed, it is plotting to restore the conscription system of the former Japanese militarist era to force the people to serve as aggressive cannon fodder. The Yoshida government forcibly implemented "resident registration" nationwide from July 1st to 5th as part of its plan to restore conscription. It required the Japanese people to carry "resident registration cards" with them and stipulated that so-called "compulsory investigators" could, like the former Japanese military police, have the right to interrogate pedestrians on the road at any time.

    This measure by the Yoshida government also aroused widespread opposition from the Japanese people. Many people refused to fill out registration forms and prohibited "investigators" from coming to investigate. Students were particularly active in this struggle. University students in Tokyo held demonstrations and burned registration forms.

### 日本人民展开反对参加“警察后备队”及反对征兵的运动  严重打击吉田政府建立美国雇佣军计划

    日本人民展开反对参加“警察后备队”及反对征兵的运动
    严重打击吉田政府建立美国雇佣军计划
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本人民到处展开的反对参加“警察后备队”和反对征兵的运动，使吉田政府建立美国雇佣军的计划受到严重的打击。
    在“警察后备队”建立之初，凋蔽的日本农村曾是美、日反动派搜罗炮灰的主要来源地之一。但是，今天反对参加“警察后备队”的运动已经深入到农村。例如，在长野县，外样村的青年团决议所有团员决不参加“警察后备队”。该县片丘村的诹访无线电台的工会妇女部曾邀集附近村庄有子弟在“后备队”的父兄们举行了一个报告会，号召他们不要再让自己的子弟去参加“警察后备队”。
    最近“警察后备队”招募新队员时，各地人民更表现了他们拒绝充当美国炮灰的决心。青森县北津轻小泊村地方的人民，在接到由村政府散发的招募说明书以后，群情忿怒，青年们把说明书付之一炬，并纷纷责备村政府变成了吉田政府的兵役科，终于迫使村长认错。
    为了弥补招募之不足，吉田政府竟公开派遣原来的“后备队”队员到自己的家乡用诱迫的手段去拉拢青年参加“后备队”，在有的地方甚至派“后备队”的乐队去宣传。但是，这一阴谋同样失败了，应募的人还是寥寥无几。山形县村山地方的应募者不到上次的三分之一。酒田市和饱海市原计划招募三百人，但实际上报名的只有三十二人。米泽市置赐地方的应募者只及上次十分之一。当“后备队”开去的吉普车停在当地旅馆门前时，群众在车上写满了“别当美国的雇佣兵！美国佬回去！”等标语。
    吉田政府在以招募方式扩充“警察后备队”的计划被挫败后，正阴谋恢复以前日本军国主义时代的征兵制度来强迫人民充当侵略炮灰。吉田政府曾从七月一日起到五日止在全国范围内强制实行“居民登记”作为恢复征兵制的计划的一部分。它要求日本人民随身携带“居民登记证”，还规定所谓“强制调查官”可以像以前的日本宪兵一样有权在路上随地盘问行人。
    吉田政府这一措施同样激起了日本人民普遍的反对，许多人都拒绝填登记表，并禁止“调查员”前来调查。学生在这个斗争中特别活跃，东京的大学生曾举行示威运动，并烧毁登记表。
