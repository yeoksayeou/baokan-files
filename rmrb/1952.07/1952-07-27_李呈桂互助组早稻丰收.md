    The early rice harvest of Li Chenggui, a well-known model farmer in Hunan Province for high rice yields, and his mutual aid team has been completed. According to the results of the Hunan Provincial Patriotic Production Appraisal and Acceptance Work Group: the entire team's 39.8 mu of rice fields yielded an average of 605 jin of dry grain per mu, exceeding the average yield of ordinary farmers by 20 percent; the 2.24 mu of high-yield fields yielded an average of 750 jin of dry grain per mu; Li Chenggui's own 13 mu of rice fields yielded an average of 710 jin of dry grain per mu.
    The bumper early rice harvest of the Li Chenggui Mutual Aid Team is the result of the team members paying attention to improving farming techniques under the leadership of Li Chenggui. This year, all team members learned from Li Chenggui's experience, and the rice fields were generally subjected to three plowings and six harrowings, or even seven harrowings; the amount of fertilizer applied was generally increased by 50 to 70 percent compared to last year, and methods of applying fertilizer in stages and mixing fertilizers were adopted; inter-tilling was also generally carried out three to four times. If their early rice had not been hit by northeasterly winds during the flowering stage, the yield would have been even higher.
    After the early rice harvest, the Li Chenggui Mutual Aid Team immediately carried out the processing and fertilization of 30 mu of intercropped late rice, and the plowing and transplanting of 9 mu of continuously cropped late rice. Li Chenggui also used his one mu of continuously cropped late rice field for close planting experiments. They are full of confidence in completing this year's production increase plan.

    李呈桂互助组早稻丰收
    湖南省著名水稻丰产模范李呈桂和他的互助组的早稻已经收割完毕。据湖南省爱国丰产评比验收工作组验收结果：全组三十九亩八分稻田每亩平均产干谷六百零五斤，超过一般农民的平均产量百分之二十，二亩二分四厘的丰产田，每亩平均产干谷七百五十斤；李呈桂自己的十三亩稻田，每亩平均产干谷达七百一十斤。
    李呈桂互助组早稻丰收，是全组组员在李呈桂领导下注意改进耕作技术的结果。今年，全组组员学习李呈桂的经验，稻田普遍进行了三犁六耙、七耙；施肥量一般比去年增加百分之五十到百分之七十，并采用了分期施用和混合施用的办法；中耕也普遍做到了三遍到四遍。他们的早稻若不是扬花时受过东北风袭击，产量还会高些。
    早稻收打后，李呈桂互助组立即进行了三十亩间作晚稻的加工施肥，和九亩连作晚稻的翻田插秧等工作。李呈桂还用自己的一亩连作晚稻田来作密植试验。他们对完成今年的增产计划，充满着信心。（新华社）
