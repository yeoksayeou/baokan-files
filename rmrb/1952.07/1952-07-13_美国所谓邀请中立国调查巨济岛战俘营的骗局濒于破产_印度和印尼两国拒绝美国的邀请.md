    Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: The governments of India and Indonesia have refused U.S. President Truman's invitation to send military observers from neutral countries to investigate the Koje Island POW camp.

    According to an Associated Press dispatch from New Delhi on the 3rd: An Indian government spokesman said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru "has refused Truman's invitation to send Indian military observers to investigate the United Nations' treatment of prisoners of war." The spokesman said: Nehru had asked the United States to "clarify" what the purpose of sending observers would be. The spokesman pointed out that the request for clarification from the United States implies that India's answer is "no."

    According to an Antara News Agency dispatch from Jakarta on the 9th: The Indonesian cabinet "has decided to reject the invitation to send observers to the Koje Island POW camp." The message said that the Indonesian government has notified Indonesian Ambassador to Washington, Sastro, to notify those concerned about Indonesia's decision.

    Truman's invitation to India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sweden, and Switzerland to investigate the Koje Island POW camp was made on June 11th, with the aim of concealing the U.S. atrocities in the Koje Island POW camp that violated the Geneva Convention. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 2nd: Truman's plan to invite five neutral countries to investigate the situation in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp has "encountered serious difficulties, and unless some foreign countries suddenly change their original intentions, the entire plan may collapse."

    美国所谓邀请中立国调查巨济岛战俘营的骗局濒于破产
    印度和印尼两国拒绝美国的邀请
    【新华社十二日讯】印度和印尼两国政府已拒绝了美国总统杜鲁门提出的所谓由中立国派遣军事观察员调查巨济岛战俘营的邀请。
    据美联社新德里三日电称：印度政府发言人说，印度总理尼赫鲁“已拒绝了杜鲁门提出的要印度派遣军事观察员前往调查联合国对待战俘情况的邀请”。发言人说：尼赫鲁曾要求美国“阐释”派遣观察员有什么用处。发言人指出，要求美国阐明的举动，即意味着印度的答复是个“不”字。
    另据安尼塔通讯社雅加达九日电称：印度尼西亚内阁“已决定拒绝接受关于派遣观察员赴巨济岛战俘营的邀请”。消息说，印尼政府已通知印尼驻华盛顿大使沙斯特罗，要他通知关心印尼这个决定的人士。
    杜鲁门邀请印度、印尼、巴基斯坦、瑞典、瑞士五国调查巨济岛战俘营，是在六月十一日提出的，其目的在于掩饰美国在巨济岛战俘营中的违反日内瓦公约的暴行。据合众社华盛顿二日电说：杜鲁门邀请五个中立国调查巨济岛俘虏营情况的计划，已“遭遇了重重的困难，除非某些外国突然改变初衷，整个计划就可能瓦解”。
