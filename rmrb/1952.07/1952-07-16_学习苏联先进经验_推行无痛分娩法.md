Brief Review of Cultural Life:

Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union and Promoting Painless Childbirth

The painless childbirth method was established by Soviet obstetricians Velvovsky, Polochai, and Shugom based on the Pavlovian theory of conditioned reflexes. It has been officially announced and implemented by the Soviet Ministry of Health, achieving excellent results in over 20,000 cases. The Clinical College of the First Military Medical University of China in Tianjin, the Second Military Medical University Hospital in Shanghai, and the Tianjin Municipal General Hospital have all implemented it, achieving significant success in over 90% of over a hundred cases.

The theory of painless childbirth is developed from the advanced neurological theory of the Soviet physiologist Pavlov. It uses the uniquely human educational methods of "language" and "text" to eliminate the fear caused by the conditioned reflex of the "inevitability of childbirth pain" in women. This is completely different from phenomenal explanations and hypotheses such as the "harmonious action between nerves and muscles."

While we use educational methods to eliminate the "painful conditioned reflex" of mothers during the implementation of painless childbirth, the main factor determining the success of this method lies in the ideology and work style of medical personnel. That is to say, obstetricians and nurses should give mothers meticulous care and show extra care for babies to achieve the expected success. Because the faith and respect of pregnant women and mothers for medical personnel are often based on the sense of responsibility and compassion of medical personnel for pregnant women and mothers.

Therefore, what painless childbirth requires of obstetricians is: a spirit of serving the masses and a mastery of the theory and methods of painless childbirth. It does not require novel medicines and instruments.

The implementation of painless childbirth can not only relieve the pain of millions of women during childbirth, but also enable mothers and babies to avoid injuries and diseases caused by pain and tension during childbirth. We have every reason to expect that after the implementation of painless childbirth, phenomena such as perineal rupture in mothers, postpartum hemorrhage, stillbirth in newborns, and head compression in babies will be reduced. This is the concrete application of the "prevention first" principle in obstetrics. Promoting painless childbirth is an important task for every maternal and child health worker and medical personnel. We should abandon outdated idealistic medical views, readily accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and learn and master this method as quickly as possible, and never treat it with doubt and distrust.

In order to popularize painless childbirth throughout the country, health authorities in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should organize medical personnel, especially obstetrics, gynecology, and maternal and child health personnel, to study articles related to painless childbirth, and lead and organize painless childbirth promotion committees. Hospitals, maternity hospitals, and maternal and child health hospitals should establish promotion teams, and gradually promote them to various places after gaining experience. Local democratic women's federations and health personnel should conduct extensive publicity and education to the masses through newspapers, magazines, radio, etc., so that women can accept this new method. Medical colleges, medical assistant midwifery schools, and nursing schools should include painless childbirth in the obstetrics and maternal and child health courses; medical colleges with conditions should conduct physiological research on painless childbirth in the obstetrics and physiology departments, and gradually popularize knowledge about painless childbirth so that it can be accepted by the general public.

### 学习苏联先进经验  推行无痛分娩法

    学习苏联先进经验  推行无痛分娩法
    无痛分娩法是苏联产科医师维利渥夫斯基、波罗琪柴尔和舒高姆等人根据苏联生理学家巴甫洛夫的条件反射学说建立起来的，已由苏联保健部正式公布实行，在两万多个例子中取得很好的成绩。我国天津第一军医大学临床学院、上海第二军医大学医院和天津市立总医院，都已先后实行，在一百多个例子中，百分之九十以上获得显著的成功。
    无痛分娩法的理论，是从苏联生理学家巴甫洛夫的高级神经学说发展起来的。它使用人类特有的“语言”和“文字”的教育方法，消除了妇女们由“分娩疼痛不可避免论”的条件反射所引起的恐惧心理。这是与现象上的解释和“神经和肌肉中间的和谐作用”等假说完全不同的。
    我们在实行无痛分娩法时固然是用教育的方法消除产妇的“疼痛性的条件反射”，但决定这一方法成功与否的主要因素在于医务人员的思想与作风。就是说，产科医生和护士对母亲应给以无微不至的体贴，对婴儿要备加爱护，才能得到预期的成功。因为孕产妇对医务人员的信仰和尊重，往往是建立在医务人员对孕产妇的责任心和同情心之上的。
    因此，无痛分娩法所要求于产科医生的是：为群众服务的精神和对无痛分娩法理论和方法的掌握。它并不需要新奇的药品和器械。
    无痛分娩法的实行，不仅可以解除千百万妇女生产时的痛苦，而且可以使母亲和婴儿避免因产时痛苦和紧张所引起的损伤和疾病。我们完全有理由预料，实行无痛分娩法以后，产妇会阴破裂、产后出血以及初生婴儿假死、婴儿头部压损等现象都将减少。这正是“预防为主”这一原则在产科上的具体应用。推广无痛分娩法，是每个妇幼卫生工作者和医务人员的重要任务。我们应该抛弃陈旧的唯心的医学观点，很好地接受苏联的先进经验，并用最快的速度学习和掌握这一方法，绝不能用怀疑和不信任的态度对待它。
    为了使无痛分娩法能够在全国范围内普遍推广起来，各大行政区、省、市卫生机关应组织医务人员，首先是妇产科和妇幼保健人员学习有关无痛分娩法的文章，并领导组织无痛分娩法推行委员会。各医院、产院、妇幼保健院要成立推行小组，待取得经验后逐渐推广各地。各地民主妇联、卫生人员，应通过报纸、杂志、广播等等对群众进行广泛的宣传教育，使妇女们接受这一新方法。各医学院校、医士助产学校和护士学校，应把无痛分娩法列入产科和妇幼卫生课程中；有条件的医学院校的产科和生理学系，应进行关于无痛分娩在生理上的研究，并使关于无痛分娩法的知识逐渐通俗化，能为人民大众所接受。
