    Introducing the Quick Literacy Method Teacher Training Class in the 10th District of Beijing
    Wu Qin
    Under the specific guidance of the Central Ministry of Education and the direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the 10th District of Beijing opened a quick literacy method teacher training class in late May. Two hundred and thirty-six full-time teachers and mass teachers were drawn from workers, citizens, farmers, and spare-time schools for short-term intensive training. After ten days of learning, the teachers who participated in the intensive training generally grasped the basic spirit and teaching methods of the quick literacy method, becoming the backbone for the widespread promotion of the quick literacy method and the development of the literacy campaign in the 10th District of Beijing.
    Before the start of the training class, the district's Culture and Education Section carried out a series of preparatory work. First, it obtained the assistance of the district party committee, trade union, democratic women's federation, and youth league, and implemented the promotion of the quick literacy method into the grass-roots organizations of factories and rural areas, thus arousing widespread attention from the masses. The masses in the rural areas helped voluntary teachers to weed and fertilize in advance, and also ensured that their production was not delayed during the study period. Seventeen villages, including Dahuangzhuang and Heiqiao, were mobilizing the whole village to dig rivers to prevent floods, but at the same time, in order not to affect the teachers' study, they were exempted from duty. Xiaozhuang also celebrated the teachers' study in the district with gongs and drums, which not only solved the contradiction between the teachers' study and production during the busy farming season, but also greatly encouraged the teachers' enthusiasm. Even teachers who were not very responsible before said: "If I don't learn the quick literacy method well and go back to work hard, I will be letting down the masses of the whole village!" Secondly, the training class organized a class committee, with the head of the district party committee's propaganda department and the head of the Culture and Education Section serving as class directors, leading the work of the training class; the district trade union and the youth league committee also sent people to participate. In addition, a group of teachers with strong abilities were cultivated in advance to give them a preliminary understanding of the spirit of the quick literacy method and to serve as study group leaders. This greatly enhanced the tutoring force. Comrades such as Qi Jianhua, the founder of the quick literacy method, were invited in advance to give lectures to enrich the learning content. Other aspects such as teaching materials, teaching aids, such as phonetic tables, character tables, and documents, as well as the students' living problems, were also fully prepared, so that learning could proceed smoothly from the beginning.
    At the beginning of the class, the students' thinking was very complicated. Those who were actively working and voluntarily participating were afraid that the days were short and they would not be able to learn and complete the task; there were also many who held a perfunctory attitude, and some said: "I don't believe in the quick literacy method, let's see what it is all about!" The class committee spent a day and a half carrying out ideological mobilization work among the students, and invited Comrade Qi Jianhua to report on the creation process and basic spirit of the quick literacy method; the secretary of the district party committee explained that people's teachers should regard the promotion of the quick literacy method and the development of the literacy movement as their major task; and Song Yuezhen, a graduate of the Gaobeidian quick literacy class, introduced her successful learning experience; an exhibition of experimental results was held. This greatly improved everyone's understanding of the quick literacy method and corrected their learning attitude. For example, Zhao Wende said: "I used to say that I had low culture and no future, and I would do as much as I could and muddle along! Qi Jianhua's story made me understand that under the leadership of the Communist Party, it all depends on whether I work hard!" Wei Bingqi said: "In the past, based on my qualifications as a college student, I always felt that teaching workers was not difficult. Today I realized that that set of subjective formalism teaching methods is completely inapplicable." Therefore, "being a good teacher of the quick literacy method" became everyone's common slogan, and they displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and persistence in their studies. Wang Jiaxiang and He Shuzhen often recited phonetic alphabets under the street lights until eleven or twelve o'clock at night, and group leaders such as Li Ying often studied the learning situation of their groups with activists late at night in order to ensure the completion of the learning tasks. The class committee and the Youth League organization, on the one hand, commended these exemplary deeds, and on the other hand, sent people to hold individual talks with the relatively backward teachers to help them make progress.
    In the teaching process, the old teaching views were thoroughly criticized, so that everyone could establish new teaching ideas. Many of the students believed that "the quick literacy method can only be applied to the People's Liberation Army, not to workers and peasants; Qi Jianhua can do it, but others can't." "Learning hundreds of characters a day is not a cramming method?" "There is nothing new in the quick literacy method, phonetic alphabet recognition has been around for a long time, and ideological mobilization is just to arouse motivation." First of all, we let everyone correctly understand the characteristics of adults, and criticized the "three-five viewpoints" in teaching (that is, the view that adults have poor memory and can only recognize three or five characters a day). "Four Society Concepts" and the way of teaching children to teach adults. The principles of "decentralizing difficulties, launching massive attacks, gradually occupying, and consolidating and improving" were explained in a simple and easy-to-understand manner; and a learning method that was consistent with theory and practice was adopted. From phonetic spelling to reading and writing, they were treated as students at each stage, and the whole set of actual character teaching process was performed in sections. After understanding how to teach, we then rose to theory to explain why we should teach in this way. For example, after learning the phonetic alphabet, we talked about why we should teach "一, ㄨ, ㄩ" first, and after attacking new words, we talked about how to teach so that students can remember quickly. In addition, according to each person's original level, cultural learning and professional learning were carried out. In this way, they not only effectively mastered the teaching methods and basic principles of the quick literacy method, but also rapidly improved their cultural level and promoted the spirit of studying their profession. For example, most of the teachers who did not know the phonetic alphabet before learned the phonetic alphabet and spelling; 60% of the people with a level below senior primary school learned two or three hundred more characters; and through actual reading and writing exercises, their reading and writing abilities have made significant progress. Zhang Shulan, who had never written before, said happily:
    "I didn't expect that I could write articles, and ten days of study is really helpful." Deng Guilian, who had only studied in private schools, said: "I used to think that classical Chinese was concise, but now I know that in order to serve workers, peasants and soldiers, the more popular the writing, the better."
    Throughout the learning process, the teaching spirit of the quick literacy method was also implemented. The learning content of each stage is "single-strike," and the tasks are closely linked and leave no gaps. In the seven-day teaching schedule, phonetic spelling takes only three hours, review takes three hours, a total of six hours; attacking four hundred new words in senior primary school textbooks takes four hours, review takes two hours, a total of six hours; reading and discussing twenty articles guiding writing takes ten hours, inspiring reports takes three hours, a total of thirteen hours; writing takes four hours, guidance takes three hours, and collective revision takes two hours, a total of nine hours. The above totals thirty-four hours. Other times are spent learning the theory of the quick literacy method. Due to the intense learning, the students' thoughts reached a high degree of concentration. They said: "If you slack off a little, you won't be able to keep up!" At the same time, the mutual assistance role of the group was brought into play, competitions were launched, and singing and other recreational activities were used to cooperate with teaching. Everyone deeply understood the basic spirit of the quick literacy method from their own experience. They said with confidence: "If you go back and use this method to teach people, there is no way not to be quick!"
    Although the learning time of the teacher training class was only a short ten days, our gains were not small. We realized from this work that in order to run the training class well, we must first require the leadership to pay attention and obtain the cooperation of all parties. If only the Culture and Education Section is singing
    "Single play," things will certainly not be done well. Teachers' ideological problems must be solved well, that is to say, they must have a correct understanding of the quick literacy method and understand its spiritual essence from the basic teaching ideas. The principle of consistency between theory and practice must be implemented in teaching. Whether it is short-term intensive training or long-term intensive training, the teaching principles must be combined with specific teaching. Generally speaking, teachers' cultural level is not high, so we must use the spirit and methods of quick success to improve their cultural and professional level, otherwise they will lag behind the masses. Teacher training is a regular task. After short-term intensive training, it is still necessary to organize teaching observations, hold meetings to study, summarize and exchange experiences. In this way, the quality of teachers can be continuously improved in actual work.

    介绍北京市第十区速成识字法教师训练班
    吴琴
    在中央教育部的具体指导和北京市文教局的直接领导下，北京市第十区于五月下旬开了一个速成识字法教师训练班，从职工、市民、农民、业余学校抽调了专任教师和群众教师二百三十六人进行短期集训。经过十天的学习，参加集训的教师一般地掌握了速成识字法的基本精神和教学方法，成为北京市第十区普遍推广速成识字法、开展识字运动的骨干。
    在训练班开始以前，区文教科进行了一系列的准备工作。首先取得了区委、工会、民主妇联、青年团的协助，把速成识字法的推广工作贯彻到工厂、农村的基层组织中去，因而引起群众的普遍重视。农村里的群众帮助义务教师抢先锄草上粪，还保证他们学习期间不耽误生产。大黄庄、黑桥等十七个村，正在动员全村挖河防涝，但同时为了不使教师的学习受到影响，就免除了他们的勤务。小庄还锣鼓喧天地欢送教师到区里学习，这就不仅解决了教师们农忙时期学习与生产的矛盾问题，而且大大鼓舞了教师的积极性。连以前不太负责的教师都说：“要不学好速成识字法，回去好好干，真对不起全村群众呢！”其次训练班组织了班委会，由区委宣传部长和文教科长任班主任，领导训练班工作；区工会、青年团团委也派人参加。并预先培养了一批能力较强的教师使他们初步了解速成识字法的精神，担任学习小组长。这就大大地增强了辅导力量。又预先邀请速成识字法创始人祁建华等同志来讲课，以充实学习内容。其它在教材、教具方面，如拼音表、字表、文件等，以及学员的生活问题，也都作了充分的准备，因而使学习一开始就能顺利地进行。
    开班之初，学员的思想是很复杂的。积极工作、自愿参加的人，怕日子短学不会，不能完成任务；抱着应付态度的也不少，有的说：“我就不信速成识字法，看看到底是个什么把戏！”班委会用了一天半的时间，在学员中进行思想动员工作，并请祁建华同志报告速成识字法的创造经过及基本精神；区委书记说明人民教师应把推广速成识字法、开展识字运动作为自己的重大任务；又由高碑店速成班毕业生宋月珍介绍自己学习成功的经过；举办实验成绩展览。这么一来，大大提高了大家对速成识字法的认识，端正了学习态度。例如赵文德说：“以前总说自己文化低没前途，能干多少就干多少，混吧！祁建华的事让我明白了在共产党领导下就在乎自己是不是努力！”蔚秉琪说：“过去我凭着自己大学生的资格，总觉得教工人是并不困难的。今天才知道那一套主观主义形式主义的教学法完全不适用了。”因此，“做个速成识字法的好教师”就成为大家的共同口号，他们在学习上发挥了高度的积极性、坚持性。王家祥、何淑贞往往在路灯下念注音字母念到夜里十一、二点，李英等小组长为了保证学习任务，常常在深夜和积极分子研究本组的学习情况。班委会和青年团组织一方面表扬这些模范事迹，另一方面派人和比较落后的教师经常举行个别谈话，帮助他们进步。
    在教学过程中彻底批判了旧的教学观点，使大家树立起新的教学思想。学员中不少人认为“速成识字法只能适用于人民解放军，对于工农就不行；祁建华行别人就不行。”“一天学百十来字，还不是填鸭式的办法？”“速成识字法没什么新鲜，拼音认字早就有了，思想动员不过是引起动机。”我们首先让大家正确地认识成人的特点，批判了教学中的“三五观点”即认为成年人记忆力差，每天只能识三、五个字的看法。）“四会观念”和用教小孩的办法来教成人的方式。又深入浅出地讲解了“分散难点、大量突击、逐步占有、巩固提高。”的原则；并采取理论与实际一致的学习方法，从注音拼音到阅读写作，各个阶段都拿他们当做学生，分段表演了全套实际教字的过程。明白了怎样教以后，然后再上升到理论，讲明白为什么要这样教。如学完注音字母后就讲为什么先教“一、ㄨ、ㄩ”，突击完生字后就讲怎样教才能使学员记得快。此外，又根据每个人的原来程度，进行了文化学习和业务学习。这样，不仅使他们切实地掌握了速成识字法的教学方法和基本原理，而且迅速地提高了他们的文化水平，发扬了钻研业务的精神。如绝大部分原来不会注音字母的教师都学会了注音和拼音；百分之六十高小以下程度的人多识了二、三百字；更通过实际阅读和写作练习，他们的阅读和写作能力更有显著的进步。从来没写作过的张淑兰高兴地说：
    “想不到我也能写文章了，十天的学习真顶事。”只在私塾里念过书的邓贵连说：“以前我总觉得文言文精炼，现在才知道要为工农兵服务，写出的东西愈通俗愈好。”
    在整个学习过程里，也贯彻了速成识字法的教学精神。各个阶段的学习内容是“单打一”的，任务又紧紧相连，不留空隙。七天教学法的学习日程中注音拼音仅用三小时，复习三小时，计六小时；突击四百个高小课本中的生字用了四小时，复习二小时，计六小时；阅读讨论二十篇指导写作的文章用了十小时，启发报告三小时，计十三小时；写作四小时，指导三小时，集体修改二小时，计九小时。以上合计三十四小时。其他时间都学速成识字法的理论。由于学习紧张，学员思想达到了高度集中。他们说：“稍一松劲就跟不上了！”同时发挥小组的互助作用，展开竞赛，用唱歌等文娱活动配合教学。大家从切身体验中，深刻地懂得了速成识字法的基本精神。他们充满信心地说：“回去用这方法教人，没有不速不成的！”
    教师训练班的学习时间虽然只有短短的十天，但是我们的收获却是不小的。我们从这一工作中认识到，要办好训练班，首先必须要求领导方面的重视，取得各方面的配合，如果只是文教科在那里唱
    “独脚戏”，事情一定是办不好的。教师的思想问题必须很好地加以解决，就是说，要使他们对速成识字法具有正确的认识，从基本的教学思想上领会它的精神实质。教学中要贯彻理论与实践一致的原则，无论短期集训或长期集训，都必须使教学原则和具体教学结合起来。一般地说，教师的文化水平是不高的，因此必须用速成的精神和办法提高他们的文化、业务水平，否则他们就会落在群众的后面。师资的培养是一件经常性的工作，经过短期集训以后，还需要经常不断地组织观摩教学，开会研究，总结和交流经验。这样，才能在实际工作中不断地提高教师的质量。
