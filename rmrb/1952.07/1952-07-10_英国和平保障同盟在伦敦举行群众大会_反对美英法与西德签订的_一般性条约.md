Xinhua News Agency, London, July 9th: According to TASS, the British Peace Pledge Union held a rally attended by hundreds of people at Trafalgar Square in London on the 6th, opposing the "General Treaty" signed by the United States, Britain, and France with the Adenauer government. Maurice, the secretary of the Peace Pledge Union, said at the meeting: The movement against the ratification of the "General Treaty" is unfolding throughout Europe, and Britain's task is to liberate itself from American rule. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the British Parliament refuse to ratify this separate military treaty with West Germany and advocating for a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to determine the conditions for achieving German reunification. The meeting decided to send this resolution to the British Foreign Office. The chairman of the meeting, Sybil Morrison, also called on the attendees to petition their members of Parliament based on the resolution. The British Peace Committee also recently issued a statement opposing the two military treaties signed in Bonn and Paris. The statement said: If the two treaties currently awaiting ratification are implemented, a situation will arise in Europe that could cause terrible events. Germany will be divided in two, and there will be no peace or treaty. According to the provisions of these two treaties, West Germany will become a vassal of the United States. If these treaties are ratified, the security of Britain and the world will be greatly threatened. The statement continued: The ratification of these treaties can be prevented. In West Germany, as in East Germany, the vast majority of residents oppose these treaties. The West German Chancellor does not have full support in parliament. In France, opposition is also widespread across the country. There is no doubt that the majority of British residents also oppose the ratification of these treaties. The statement denounced: Only the US government wants to delay discussions on the Soviet note in order to evade negotiations and is trying to force the governments of other countries to support these treaties against the will of their own people.

    英国和平保障同盟在伦敦举行群众大会
    反对美英法与西德签订的“一般性条约”
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国和平保障同盟六日在伦敦特拉法尔加广场举行了有数百人参加的大会，反对美英法三国与阿登纳政府签订的“一般性条约”。和平保障同盟书记莫里斯在会上发言说：反对批准“一般性条约”的运动，正在整个欧洲展开，英国的任务是从美国的统治下把它自己解放出来。大会通过决议，要求英国议会拒绝批准这个对西德的单独军事条约并赞成举行苏美英法四大国会议，以确定达成德国统一的条件。大会决定把这个决议送交英国外交部。大会主席西贝尔·摩里逊并号召到会群众根据决议去向议员们请愿。英国和平委员会最近也发表声明，反对在波恩和巴黎签订的两个军事条约。声明说：如果目前正待批准的两个条约一旦付诸实行，欧洲就会产生能引起可怕事件的形势。德国势将割裂为二，得不到和平与和约。根据这两个条约的规定，西德将变成美国的附庸。如果这种条约批准了，英国和世界的安全将遭到莫大的威胁。声明继续说：这些条约的批准是可以制止的。在西德，和在东德一样，绝大多数居民都反对这些条约。西德总理在议会内得不到充分的支持。在法国，反对意见也遍及全国。毫无疑问，英国大多数居民也是反对批准这些条约的。声明斥责：只有美国政府，才想迟迟不讨论苏联照会，以逃避谈判，并竭力使其他各国的政府违反本国人民的意志来支持这些条约。
