National Model Worker Ma Hengchang
    Determined to Study Hard and Do More Work for the Motherland

    Respected Chairman Mao: I want to say a few words to express my gratitude to the Party and to you—our great leader.

    I was born into a poor peasant family. At the age of eleven, I herded pigs and cattle for landlords, never having enough to eat or wear, and often being beaten and scolded. At the age of seventeen, I went to a factory to learn a trade, but life was still difficult to maintain. During the puppet Manchukuo period, it was even worse. I ate soybean cakes and acorn flour. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I thought good days would finally come, but I didn't expect the Kuomintang bandits to arrive. Workers were still oppressed and exploited, living a life of suffering.

    After liberation, we workers truly turned over. Not only did we improve our living conditions, but our political status also improved. Under the Party's cultivation and education, my class consciousness has been raised, and production has become more active. In 1949, our production team explored some experiences, and the Party encouraged me and gave me honor. In September, I gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In January 1951, our team issued a challenge to workers across the country, which was enthusiastically responded to by employees from all over. Thanks to the efforts of our worker brothers, we have made some achievements in production; but this is still far from the requirements of the people of the motherland. In order to further train me and enable me to do more work for the motherland, the Party sent me to study at the Northeast Experimental School's Workers and Peasants’ Fast-Track Middle School on December 30, 1951. I had never read a book in my life, and I am already forty-six years old this year. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I am now actually attending middle school, and will even go to university in the future. How can this not make me feel happy! I know that this happiness is brought to us by the Party and you.

    Respected Chairman Mao, in the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, I received a profound education and improved my class consciousness and ideological level. Today, I express to you: In order to consolidate our victory, I will actively participate in Party rectification and study, continue to improve my class consciousness, study culture and theory hard, exercise, and strive to do more work for the Party and the motherland in the future, and build our beautiful future—a socialist and communist society.

    决心努力学习为祖国做更多工作
    敬爱的毛主席：我要向您说几句话，来表示我对党、对您——我们伟大的领袖的感激。
    我生在一个贫农的家里，十一岁就给地主家放猪、放牛，吃不饱，穿不暖，还时常挨打受骂。十七岁时，我进工厂学手艺，生活还是很难维持。伪满时，更惨了，我吃的是豆饼、橡子面儿。抗战胜利以后，我想这回该过好日子了，但没想到，国民党匪帮来了，工人照样受压迫、受剥削，还是过着痛苦的生活。
    解放以后，我们工人真正翻了身。我们不但改善了生活，政治地位也提高了。在党的培养教育下，我的阶级觉悟提高了，生产也就更积极了。一九四九年，我们的生产小组摸索了一些经验，党就鼓励我，给我以荣誉。九月，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。一九五一年一月，我们小组向全国工人同志们提出挑战，得到各地职工热烈的响应。由于工人兄弟们的努力，我们在生产上有了一些成绩；但这比起祖国人民对我们的要求还差得很远。党为了进一步培养我，使我能给祖国做更多的工作，在一九五一年十二月三十日把我送到东北实验学校工农速成中学学习。我过去一天书也没念过，今年已经四十六岁了，在党和毛主席的领导下，现在居然上了中学，将来还要升大学，这怎能不使我感到幸福！我知道，这幸福是党和您给我们带来的。
    敬爱的毛主席，在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动中，我受了深刻的教育，提高了阶级觉悟和思想水平。今天，我向您表示：为了巩固我们的胜利，我要积极参加整党学习，继续提高阶级觉悟，努力学习文化和理论，锻炼身体，争取将来为党、为祖国做更多的工作，建设我们美好的未来——社会主义与共产主义社会。
    东北实验学校工农速成中学学生    马恒昌
