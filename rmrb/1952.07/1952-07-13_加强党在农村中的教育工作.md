    Strengthening the Party's Education Work in Rural Areas
    Lin Feng, Member of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

    (I)
    In recent years, our Party has done a lot of work in the rural areas of Northeast China, and it has been successful. We not only led the peasants to carry out land reform during the most tense years of the Liberation War, liberating them from thousands of years of feudal shackles and gaining land and other means of production, but also actively led the vast number of peasants after the land reform to organize and develop production. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the rural areas of Northeast China has been developing and improving year by year. At present, the number of households organized accounts for more than 80 percent of the total number of agricultural households. The number of year-round mutual aid teams has increased greatly, and we have begun to pilot agricultural production cooperatives and a small number of collective farms this year with a focus.

    We have also carried out a lot of work in improving agricultural technology. Northeast farmers have always used backward and crude farm tools for production. This backward farm tool determined the backward farming methods, and the backward farming methods made it difficult to increase yields and make farmers rich. The Party fully paid attention to this major problem and began to steadily reform farm tools and promote new farm tools from 1950. In the next five or six years, new-style animal-drawn farm tools will be largely used in the rural areas of Northeast China, which will further promote the development of agricultural production cooperatives, greatly improve agricultural productivity, and prepare conditions for agricultural collectivization and mechanization. In terms of flood control and water management, the Party decided in 1950 to focus on fundamental solutions, that is, in addition to generally carrying out dike construction and damming work, it will focus on actively developing water resources, and prepare to carry out modern water conservancy construction that combines water management with power generation, irrigation, shipping, and industrial water use. In order to fundamentally transform natural conditions and eliminate wind, sand, and water disasters, the Party decided in 1950 to carry out a huge-scale western shelterbelt construction plan, which began in 1951.

    Organizing, improving and upgrading agricultural technology, and continuously improving agricultural productivity are the main tasks of the Party in the rural areas of Northeast China. In recent years, agricultural production in Northeast China has achieved rapid recovery and development, and the lives of farmers have been significantly improved. Most of the poor peasants and farm laborers before the land reform have risen to become middle peasants. At present, middle peasants have become the majority in the rural areas. In the old liberated areas in the north, middle peasants account for about 60 to 70 percent, and in the southern areas that were liberated later, they account for more than 50 percent. Among the rising households, about 20 percent have become well-to-do middle peasants, and a few have developed into new rich peasants. Due to various reasons, the number of households with declining economy and living difficulties accounts for only about 5 percent. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The effect, good or bad, great or small, of the policy and practice of any Chinese political party upon the Chinese people depends ultimately on whether, and how much, they help to develop their productive forces." ("On Coalition Government") Judging from the economic rise of Northeast peasants, we have correctly implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's and the Party's policies.

    (II)
    Based on the development of industry in Northeast China, it is advantageous to improve agricultural technology, continuously improve agricultural productivity, develop the rural economy, and improve the lives of farmers. But this does not mean that there are no problems in rural work. In fact, there are still many problems.

    With the development of the rural economy, there are two different paths facing farmers: one is the spontaneous capitalist trend among small-scale farmers, which is familiar to farmers; the other is the path of collectivization under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, which farmers are moving forward along under the leadership of the Party, but this is unfamiliar to farmers. The leadership of the working class and the Party is the decisive factor in ensuring the realization of this basic policy. Lenin said: "Small-scale production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale." (Lenin, "'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder") Stalin profoundly pointed out: "Peasant economy, as far as the overwhelming majority of peasant households are concerned, is a small commodity economy. And what is a small commodity peasant economy? It is an economy standing at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. It can develop towards capitalism, as is the case in capitalist countries today, or it can develop towards socialism, as is the case in our country, under the dictatorship of the proletariat." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," Vol. 2, p. 38, Liberation Press.)

    On the issue of the direction of rural economic development and how to deal with the actual problems occurring in rural areas today, are all comrades ideologically clear, instead of hesitating at the crossroads? No. Some comrades believe that since class differentiation in rural areas is inevitable after the land reform, it should be allowed to develop freely, and there is no need to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation. This is obviously wrong. Engels said: "It would be of no use if we waited until capitalist production had everywhere developed to its ultimate limit, and let the last small handicraftsman and the last small peasant become victims of large-scale capitalist production, before undertaking this transformation (note: that is, the transformation from small peasants to a cooperative system)." (Engels, "The Peasant Question") Of course, it is impossible for us to have something like "let the last small handicraftsman and the last small peasant become victims of large-scale capitalist production" happen here, but we must never think that we can let things take their own course and there is no need to carry out arduous work, and socialism will come naturally. It should be known that in order to smoothly transition the rural economy from today's mutual aid and cooperation to socialist collectivization and avoid taking the capitalist road, it is a long-term, arduous, practical education and organizational work process of the Party for the vast number of peasants. We see that some peasants in rural areas lend money at usurious rates, and even some directors of supply and marketing cooperatives and village cadres lend money at usurious rates, or use cooperative funds to open small shops and develop their personal "capitalism." After we announced the reasonable lending policy (no more than 3% interest), usury has turned into a hidden form, such as borrowing corn in the spring and returning the same amount of wheat in the autumn, borrowing one catty of straw in the spring and returning one catty of soybeans in the autumn; even joining mutual aid teams with labor fees, buying more land to bring into mutual aid teams and distributing grain according to the land, etc. This shows that the capitalist trend in rural areas is a great spontaneous force, which not only attracts the vast number of peasants every day and every hour, but also erodes rural party members and cadres, and brings it into the organizations of mutual aid teams and cooperatives. In the past, there was a period in rural areas when they did not dare to publicize socialism, saying that they were afraid of increasing the ideological concerns of the masses and affecting the enthusiasm for production. This was obviously a relaxation of the Party's ideological leadership in rural areas.

    The Party's policies and decisions are correct, but they are often distorted in the specific implementation in rural areas. For example, in this spring's grain purchase, it was stipulated that more should be purchased if there is more surplus, less should be purchased if there is less surplus, and no purchase if there is no surplus. However, in the specific implementation, some places did not persuade and educate the peasants well but adopted coercive methods; some places did not conduct good investigation and research, and regardless of the amount of surplus grain, they adopted the method of equal apportionment. This naturally aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and caused losses in the work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's education work, so that cadres understand how to correctly treat and implement the Party's policies, and understand the consistency of being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the masses, in order to improve the work style and strengthen the Party's ties with the masses.

    With the development of the rural economy, some rural party members are breeding exploitative ideas. Some cadres are beginning to become corrupt and degenerate, and some even abuse their powers and act tyrannically in order to pursue personal desires. All these are essentially the result of the erosion of bourgeois ideology. As Stalin said: "Right deviation in the Communist Party is the tendency or inclination of some Communist Party members to deviate from our Party's general line and go to the bourgeois ideology. Although it has not yet been formally formed, and perhaps has not yet been realized, it is still such a deviation." ("Problems of Leninism," p. 290) This must be given our serious attention. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out serious party consolidation work in rural areas, resolutely overcome the phenomena of corruption and degeneration and detachment from the masses among some party members, and remove those hopelessly degenerate elements from the Party.

    (III)
    The rural economic development direction and socialist prospects education carried out in various places last winter played an important role in raising the ideological awareness of rural party members and the vast number of peasants and in further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, in this year's mutual aid and cooperation work, especially in the work of focusing on piloting agricultural production cooperatives, another deviation has occurred in some areas. Regardless of the experience of the masses in mutual aid and cooperation, the degree of political awareness, and the conditions of the leading backbone, they have adopted a rash attitude and blindly organized too many agricultural production cooperatives. Some even violated the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and some stipulated excessive public accumulation funds. This practice of violating the Party's policy of focusing on piloting and gradually developing, as well as other inappropriate practices, is obviously detrimental to the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives.

    At present, farmers participating in mutual aid teams and production cooperatives inevitably generally have conservative and selfish psychology to varying degrees. For example, in a certain place, there is a family of two. The husband wants to join the collective farm, but the wife opposes it. In the end, the husband has the final say and joins the farm, but the wife's thinking is still not clear. Soon, the horse they joined in the farm had a foal. The wife hugged the foal and cried, complaining to her husband: "I told you not to join, but you insisted on joining; if we didn't join the farm, this foal would be ours, but now this foal belongs to others." For another example, a collective farm divided two agricultural production teams. The first team prepared the plows the night before, and the next morning they found that the "thousand jin" on the plows were missing. Later, it was found that the "thousand jin" was hidden by the second team for the sake of competition. It can be seen that it is important to educate farmers to solve the contradiction between personal interests and collective interests, and to combine personal interests and collective interests. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The serious problem is the education of the peasantry. The peasant economy is scattered, and each household is a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into permanent poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." ("Get Organized!") Lenin also said: "It takes several generations to transform small peasants, to transform all the psychology and habits of small peasants." (Lenin, "On the Tax in Kind")

    (IV)
    It is necessary to repeatedly educate the peasants for a long time that the road of gradual transition to agricultural collectivization through cooperation is the only correct way to enable the vast number of peasants to get rid of poverty forever. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As far as the peasant masses are concerned, they have been in individual economy for thousands of years, and each household is a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into permanent poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." ("Get Organized!")

    It is necessary to educate rural cadres that in order to correctly implement the Party's policy, it is necessary to oppose both coercion and commandism and laissez-faire. It is necessary to adopt the method of patient persuasion and typical demonstration, and gradually guide the vast number of peasants to the road of cooperation on the basis of the masses' conscious voluntariness. This is the only correct way. Only in this way can the mutual aid and cooperation movement develop healthily, agricultural productivity can be continuously improved, and the masses will realize from their own experience that the Party's road of cooperation is the only correct way. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "In all work, commandism is wrong, because it exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of voluntariness of the masses, and suffers from acute illness. Our comrades must not think that what they understand is also understood by the vast number of masses. Whether the masses have understood and whether they are willing to take action can only be known by going to the masses to investigate. If we do this, we can avoid commandism. In all work, tailism is also wrong, because it lags behind the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of leading the masses to move forward, and suffers from chronic illness. Our comrades must not think that what they do not understand is also not understood by the masses. Many times, the vast number of masses have run ahead of us and urgently need to move forward. Our comrades cannot be the leaders of the vast number of masses, but reflect the opinions of a part of the backward elements, and mistakenly regard the opinions of these backward elements as the opinions of the vast number of masses, and become the tail of the backward elements." ("On Coalition Government")

    In short, we must resolutely advance along the road of cooperation towards the future direction of collectivization in developing the rural economy. With the development of industry, we will supply the rural areas with a large number of new-style farm tools and some tractors within five or six years. Agricultural production cooperatives will become the main organizational form of agricultural production, and collective farms and state-owned farms will also have further development. This means that our rural economy will develop at a speed that has never been seen in history. This requires us to do a good job in organization, do a good job in education, do a good job in technical training, and help the farmers in mutual aid and cooperation do a good job in business management. New situations will bring us a series of new problems, which requires us to be good at learning, good at accepting new things, good at timely leading the movement and conducting specific guidance, and we must overcome all conservative ideas and old-fashioned empirical work methods. All rural workers should have a clear awareness of this. We communists always look forward and always stand in front to lead the masses forward. In order to accelerate the development of our cause, our Party's rural branches must become strong fortresses for leading production, leading the cooperative movement, and leading political and cultural education. We must eliminate non-working-class ideas within the Party, and criticize exploitative ideas and capitalist ideas. We must conduct political and ideological education and socialist prospect education to all rural cadres, Communist Party members, Youth League members, and the vast number of peasants.

    加强党在农村中的教育工作
    中共中央东北局委员    林枫
    （一）
    几年来，我党在东北农村作了很多工作，而且是有成绩的。我们不仅在解放战争最紧张的年代，领导农民实行了土地改革，使之从几千年的封建枷锁中解放出来，获得了土地和其他的生产资料，而且在土地改革之后，又积极地领导了广大农民，组织起来发展生产。东北农村的互助合作运动历年均有发展和提高，目前组织起来的户数约占农业总户数的百分之八十以上，常年互助组大大增加，我们并从今年开始有重点地试办了农业生产合作社和少数集体农庄。
    在改进农业技术方面，我们也进行了许多工作。东北农民从来使用着落后的粗笨农具进行生产，这种落后农具决定了落后的耕作方法，而落后的耕作方法是很难提高产量并使农民富裕起来的。党充分地注意了这一重大问题，从一九五○年起，就开始稳步地进行改革农具和推广新式农具的工作。今后五六年内，东北农村即将大部使用新式马拉农具，这就会进一步促进农业生产合作社的发展，使农业生产力大大提高，并为农业集体化、机械化准备条件。在防洪治水方面，党在一九五○年即决定了以治本为主的方针，就是除了一般地进行筑堤堵口工作之外，将着重于从积极方面重点地开发水利资源，准备进行治水和发电、灌溉、航运及工业用水相结合的近代化的水利建设。为了从根本上改造自然条件，杜绝风沙水患，党在一九五○年又决定进行巨大规模的西部防护林带的营造计划，一九五一年业已开始营造。
    组织起来，改进和提高农业技术，不断地提高农业生产力，是党在东北农村中的主要任务。几年来东北农业生产获得了迅速的恢复和发展，农民生活有了显著的改善，多数土地改革前的贫雇农已上升为中农，目前中农已成为农村中的大多数，北部老区中农约占百分之六十至七十，南部解放较晚的地区约占百分之五十以上。在上升户中，约有百分之二十已成为富裕中农，少数已发展成为新富农。由于各种原因经济下降、生活困难的户数，仅占百分之五左右。毛泽东同志说：“中国一切政党的政策及其实践在中国人民中所表现的作用的好、坏、大、小，归根到底，看其对于中国人民的生产力的发展是否有帮助及其帮助之大小。”（“论联合政府”）从东北农民经济上升的情况看，我们是正确地贯彻执行了毛泽东同志和党的方针的。
    （二）
    在东北工业发展的基础上，改进农业技术，不断地提高农业生产力，以发展农村经济，改善农民生活，是具备着有利条件的。但这不是说在农村工作中没有问题了，实际上问题还是很多的。
    随着农村经济的发展，摆在农民面前有两条不同的道路：一条是在小生产的农民中自发的资本主义趋势，这条道路是农民们所熟悉的；另一条道路是在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，经过合作化，走向集体化的道路，农民们正在党的领导下循着这条道路前进，但是这是农民们所不熟悉的。工人阶级和党的领导是保证实现这一基本政策的决定因素。列宁说过：“小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地大批产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。”（列宁：“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）斯大林深刻地指出：“农民经济按绝大多数农户来说，是小商品经济。而小商品农民经济又是什么呢？它是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济。它既可能发展到资本主义方面去，如现在资本主义国家里的情形那样，也可以发展到社会主义方面去，如在我们国家里，在无产阶级专政条件下所要发生的情形一样。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”下册三八页，解放社版。）
    在农村经济发展的方向问题上，以及如何对待今天农村所发生的实际问题上，是否所有的同志思想上都很明确，而不是徘徊在十字路口呢？不是的。有的同志认为：在土地改革之后，既然农村阶级分化是不可避免的，就让它自由发展好了，用不着加强对互助合作的领导了。这显然是不对的。恩格斯说：“如果我们等待资本主义生产到处都发展到极限，让最后一个小手工业者和最后一个小农都变成大资本主义生产底牺牲品时，才来进行这个改造（按：即由小农走向合作制的改造），那是没有益处的。”（恩格斯：“农民问题”）当然，在我们这里已经没有可能发生“让最后一个小手工业者和最后一个小农都变成大资本主义生产底牺牲品”这样的事，但也绝不能认为我们可以放任自流，不必进行艰苦的工作，社会主义就会自然地到来。须知要使农村的经济顺利地由今天的互助合作过渡到社会主义集体化，避免走资本主义的道路，乃是党对广大农民长期的、艰苦的实际教育工作和组织工作过程。我们看到在农村中有些农民放高利贷，甚至有的供销合作社主任和村干部放高利贷，或者利用合作社资金，个人开小铺，发展他个人的“资本主义”。我们宣布合理借贷政策（不得超三分利）以后，高利贷又转变为隐蔽的形式，如春借苞米秋还同数小麦，春借一斤谷草秋还一斤大豆；甚至有的带劳金加入互助组，多买地带入互助组按地分粮等。这就说明，农村资本主义趋势是一个很大的自发力量，它不仅每日每时地吸引着广大的农民群众，而且也侵蚀到农村党员和干部身上，并带到互助组和合作社的组织里边去了。过去在农村中曾经有一个时期不敢宣传社会主义，据说是怕增加群众思想顾虑，影响生产情绪，显然这是放松了党在农村中的思想领导。
    党的政策和决定是正确的，但在农村具体执行中，却时常走样子。譬如今春购粮，规定多余多购，少余少购，不余不购，而在具体执行中，有些地方不很好地向农民进行说服教育而采取了强迫命令的方法；有些地方不很好地调查研究，不管余粮多少，采取了平均摊派的办法。这自然就引起群众不满，造成工作上的损失。因此，必须加强党的教育工作，使干部们懂得正确地对待和执行党的政策，懂得向党负责和向群众负责的一致性，以改进工作作风和密切党与群众的联系。
    随着农村经济的发展，某些农村党员滋长着剥削思想。有的干部开始走向腐化堕落，有的甚至为了追逐个人私欲，滥用职权，横行霸道。所有这些，实质上是资产阶级思想侵蚀的结果。正如斯大林所说：“共产党内的右倾就是一部分共产党员离开了我们党底总路线，而走到资产阶级思想方面去的趋向或偏向，固然是尚未正式形成的，也许是还没有觉悟到的，但毕竟是这样的一种偏向。”（“列宁主义问题”，二九○页）这是必须引起我们严重注意的，因此，在农村中进行严肃的整党工作，坚决克服某些党员中腐化堕落、脱离群众的现象，清除那些不可救药的蜕化分子出党，是十分必要的。
    （三）
    去年冬季各地所进行的农村经济发展方向和社会主义远景教育，对提高农村党员和广大农民的思想觉悟、对进一步发展互助合作运动，起了重要作用。但在今年进行互助合作的工作中，特别是在重点试办农业生产合作社的工作中，部分地区却又产生了另一种偏向，不顾群众互助合作的经验如何，政治觉悟程度如何，领导骨干的条件如何，采取了急躁的态度，盲目地组织了过多的农业生产合作社。甚至有的违反了自愿两利的原则，有的规定了过多的公积金。这种违背党的重点试办、逐步发展方针的做法以及其他各种不适当的做法，对农业生产合作社的发展和巩固，显然是不利的。
    在目前，参加互助组和生产合作社的农民，在不同程度上，不可避免地一般都存有保守的和自私的心理。如某地有一个两口之家，丈夫要加入集体农庄，老婆反对，最后还是丈夫说了算，加入了农庄，但老婆思想仍然搞不通。不久他们加入到农庄的马下了驹。老婆抱着马驹哭起来，埋怨丈夫说：“不叫你加入，你一定要加入；如果不加入农庄，这个马驹就是咱们的，现在这个马驹就成人家的了。”又如有个集体农庄分组两个农业生产队，第一队头一天晚间准备好了犁杖，第二天一早发现犁杖上的“千斤”丢了，后来发现这个“千斤”是被第二队为了竞赛给藏起来了。由此可见，教育农民解决个人利益和集体利益的矛盾，并把个人利益和集体利益结合起来是重要的。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“严重的问题是教育农民。农民的经济是分散的，根据苏联的经验，需要很长的时间和细心的工作，才能做到农业社会化。没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”（“论人民民主专政”）列宁也说过：“改造小农，改造小农底全部心理和习惯，是需要有几代工夫的事情。”（列宁：“论物品税”）
    （四）
    必须长期反复地教育农民：经过合作化逐渐过渡到农业集体化的道路，是使广大农民永远摆脱贫困的唯一正确道路。毛泽东同志说过：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”（“组织起来”）
    必须教育农村干部：为了正确贯彻执行党的这一方针，既要反对强迫命令，又要反对放任自流。必须采取耐心说服，典型示范的办法，在群众自觉自愿的基础上逐渐引导广大农民走向合作化的道路，这是唯一正确的办法。只有如此，互助合作运动才能健康地发展，农业生产力才能不断地提高，群众才会从切身体验中认识到党的合作化的道路是唯一正确的道路。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。我们的同志不要以为自己了解了的东西，广大群众也和自己一样一概都了解了。群众是否已经了解并且是否愿意行动起来，要到群众中去考察才会知道。如果我们这样做，就可以避免命令主义。在一切工作中，尾巴主义也是错误的，因为它落后于群众的觉悟程度，违反了领导群众前进一步的原则，害了慢性病。我们的同志不要以为自己尚不了解的东西，群众也一概不了解。许多时候，广大群众跑到我们的前头去了，迫切地需要前进一步了，我们的同志不能做广大群众的领导者，却反映了一部分落后分子的意见，并将此种落后分子的意见误认为广大群众的意见，做了落后分子的尾巴。”（“论联合政府”）
    总之，我们发展农村经济，必须坚决沿着合作化的道路向将来的集体化的方向前进。随着工业的发展，我们将在五六年之内，供应农村以大批新式农具和部分拖拉机，农业生产合作社将成为农业生产的主要组织形式，集体农庄和国营农场也将有进一步的发展。这就是说，我们的农村经济将以历史上从来没有过的速度向前发展。这就要求我们做好组织工作，做好教育工作，做好技术训练工作，帮助互助合作中的农民作好经营管理工作。新的情况会给我们带来一系列的新问题，这就要求我们必须善于学习，善于接受新鲜事物，善于及时地领导运动和进行具体指导，必须克服一切保守思想和经验主义老一套的工作方法，对于这一点，一切农村工作者都应有明确的自觉。我们共产党人总是向前看的，总是站在前面领导群众前进的。为了加速我们事业的发展，我党农村支部必须成为领导生产、领导合作运动、领导政治文化教育的坚强堡垒，必须在党内清除非工人阶级的思想，批判剥削思想和资本主义思想。必须对一切农村干部、共产党员、青年团员和广大农民经常地进行政治思想教育和社会主义远景教育。    （原载七月九日东北日报）
