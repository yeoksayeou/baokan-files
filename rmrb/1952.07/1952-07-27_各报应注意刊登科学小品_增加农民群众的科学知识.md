    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Publishing Science Essays to Increase Farmers' Scientific Knowledge

    Comrade Editor: I work in the Propaganda Department of the Yuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province. Recently, during a field inspection of propaganda work, I found that many comrades engaged in propaganda work and village propagandists lacked natural science knowledge. Therefore, they were not only unable to make forceful criticisms of the remaining superstitious ideas among the masses, but were instead left speechless by the questions from the masses. For example, Bian Bingkun, a propagandist in Liangbei Township, discovered that after the township experienced hail, some people held superstitious beliefs such as "sent down by the gods," "natural disasters are unavoidable," and "if people don't take, heaven will." He propagated to the masses that these ideas were wrong and were superstitious. But when the masses asked him, "Why does the sky send down hail?" he couldn't answer. Another example is in Caoxu Township this spring, when bad elements carried out sabotage activities, tricking the masses into going to the river to fetch "divine fire." The propagandists were unable to persuade the masses based on scientific knowledge and had to use militia to stand guard and stop them. As a result, although the masses dared not fetch the "divine fire," the ideological problem of the masses was not resolved. In addition, some propagandists who themselves did not understand gave random explanations, which instead fueled superstitious ideas. For example, Huang Chunfang, a propagandist in Liangbei Township, when answering the question of "Why does the sun have a halo," mistakenly explained it as "because dead cats and dogs were thrown into the well." This further fueled the superstitious ideas of the masses. In order to help rural propagandists correctly answer some difficult questions about natural science among the peasant masses and increase the scientific knowledge of the peasant masses, I suggest that local newspapers, magazines, and propagandist publications appropriately publish some natural science essays or popular talks that address some of the superstitious ideas prevalent in rural areas. This is also a regular and important task for newspapers and periodicals to promote science and educate the peasant masses with science.

### 各报应注意刊登科学小品  增加农民群众的科学知识

    各报应注意刊登科学小品  增加农民群众的科学知识
    编辑同志：我在中共河南省禹县县委宣传部工作。最近下乡检查宣传工作时，发现不少作宣传工作的同志和乡的宣传员，缺乏自然科学知识，因此对群众中残存的迷信思想不但不能作有力的批判，相反的被群众问得无言可答。例如梁北乡宣传员边丙坤在该乡下冰雹后，发现群众中有“神下的”、“天灾难躲”、“人不收天收”等迷信说法，他就向群众宣传说这种说法不对，是迷信思想。但当群众问他“你说天为啥降雹”时，他就答不上来了。又如曹徐乡今春有坏分子进行破坏活动，把群众骗到河里去取“神火”，宣传员不能依据科学知识说服群众，不得不利用民兵站岗加以制止。这样作的结果，虽然群众不敢去取“神火”了，但并未解决群众的思想问题。另外，也有些宣传员自己不懂，却乱加解释，反助长了迷信思想。如梁北乡宣传员黄春芳，当答复“太阳为啥发圈”这个问题时，却错误地解释为“因井里扔了死猫死狗”。这就更助长了群众的迷信思想。为了帮助农村宣传员正确解答农民群众中关于自然科学上的一些疑难，增加农民群众的科学知识，我建议各地报纸、杂志及宣传员刊物，针对农村中流行的一些迷信思想，适当地刊登一些有关自然科学的小品或通俗的讲话。这也是报刊提倡科学并用科学教育农民群众的一个经常性的重要工作。
