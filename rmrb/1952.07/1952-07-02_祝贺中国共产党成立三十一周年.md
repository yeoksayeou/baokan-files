    Telegrams of Congratulations to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from All Commanders, Fighters, and Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
    As we celebrate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on the Korean front, we extend our heartfelt congratulations and highest respect to you and the Communist Party of China.
    Under your leadership and that of the Communist Party of China, our country has undergone great movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, achieving brilliant accomplishments in both national defense and economic construction. This has given our great motherland unparalleled strength and boundless power.
    Encouraged and supported by the great power of our motherland, our Chinese People's Volunteers have become increasingly strong and filled with confidence in victory. In the second year of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we have closely united and fought in coordination with the Korean People's Army, achieving a great victory of annihilating more than 325,000 enemy troops. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have defeated the enemy's conspiracies and tricks both on the battlefield and in the armistice negotiations, laying the foundation for the final victory of peace in Korea.
    The enemy we face is the ferocious but already declining U.S. imperialism. The solemn task we shoulder of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is a supremely glorious mission in the global cause of resisting aggression and defending peace. We will never fail the expectations of the people of our motherland. We solemnly swear: As long as U.S. imperialism continues its criminal aggression in Korea, we will continue to inflict heavier blows on the enemy. We will fight to the end to achieve a fair and reasonable peaceful resolution to the Korean issue!
    Respectfully,
    All Commanders, Fighters, and Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Telegram of Congratulations from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Dear Chairman Mao and All Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
    On the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, allow us to first represent the working class of the whole country in extending warm congratulations to you and all comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    From their long struggles and personal experiences, the Chinese working class deeply realizes that the Communist Party of China is the party that truly represents the interests of the Chinese working class. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by you, the Chinese working class could not have been liberated, and the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious. You are like a beacon illuminating the way forward for the Chinese working class, and like a loving mother caring for the labor, life, and study of the Chinese working class. The Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, has achieved a series of great victories under your wise leadership. Now, on the basis of the victories of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, the working class of the whole country is enthusiastically responding to your great call, launching a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy, and preparing for the great task of economic construction that is about to come, so as to rapidly industrialize our great motherland and create conditions for striving for the socialist and communist future of China. Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    Telegram of Congratulations from the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: Respected Chairman Mao,
    The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has now successfully concluded, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has been officially established. At this moment, as we joyfully celebrate the great "July 1st" – the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we respectfully extend our highest regards to the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao on behalf of industrialists and businessmen throughout the country!
    The great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people's revolution, liberated the entire Chinese mainland, created the People's Republic of China, and achieved brilliant victories in the three major movements of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production and economic construction. Our country will systematically move towards industrialization. "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." Without Chairman Mao, our national industrial and commercial circles would not have today's liberation and bright future. We joyfully celebrate the birthday of the Communist Party of China, and we respectfully offer assurances to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on behalf of industrialists and businessmen throughout the country: We will always abide by the Common Program loyally under the education and leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, strive to develop production, prosper the economy, and jointly strive for the economic construction of New Democracy under the overall national economic plan! We respectfully extend our highest regards! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    祝贺中国共产党成立三十一周年
    志愿军全体指战员和工作员贺电毛主席并中国共产党中央委员会：
    我们在朝鲜前线热烈纪念中国共产党诞生三十一周年，向你和中国共产党谨致衷心的祝贺与崇高的敬礼。
    我们的国家在你和中国共产党的领导下，经过了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命以及“三反”“五反”等伟大运动，在国防建设和经济建设方面都获得了辉煌的成就，因而使我们伟大祖国有着无比雄厚、无穷无尽的力量。
    在祖国伟大力量的鼓舞和支援下，我们中国人民志愿军已经愈益强大，更加充满胜利信心。在朝鲜抗美战争的第二年中，我们和朝鲜人民军亲密团结、协同作战，又取得了歼灭敌军三十二万五千多人的巨大战果，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，无论在战场上或在停战谈判中都击败了敌人的阴谋诡计，奠定了最后赢得朝鲜和平的胜利基础。
    我们面对的敌人是穷凶极恶但已到了日暮途穷的美帝国主义。我们所肩负的抗美援朝的庄严任务，是全世界反抗侵略、保卫和平事业中无尚光荣的使命。我们决不辜负祖国人民对我们的期望，我们庄严宣誓：只要美帝国主义继续在朝鲜进行罪恶的侵略，我们就再接再厉地予敌人以更沉重的打击，我们要为争取公平合理地和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员、工作员
