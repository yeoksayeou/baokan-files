Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 11th: The Korean Central News Agency published an article commemorating the first anniversary of the Korean armistice negotiations, entitled "What Did the Aggressors Attempt to Achieve in the Past Year of Korean Armistice Negotiations?" The article stated:

    The Korean armistice negotiations began on July 10th last year. The complete failure of the adventure plan to conquer Korea forced the American aggressors to begin armistice negotiations a year ago. However, under the guise of negotiations, they conducted several major offensives and various provocative actions on the front lines, bringing the negotiations to a standstill. The purpose of these actions by the aggressors was to continue the Korean War, which would bring huge profits to Wall Street's monopoly groups.

    The Americans repeatedly bombed and strafed the Kaesong neutral zone with machine guns, constantly interrupting the negotiations. The most obvious proof of the aggressors' aggressive conspiracy is that the intervention troops used poison gas and conducted large-scale bacteriological warfare on the front lines during the negotiations. During the discussion of the last remaining issue on the agenda—the exchange of prisoners of war—the aggressors committed heinous atrocities—slaughtering our captured personnel who wished to return home.

    On the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, the U.S. side shamelessly violated the Geneva Convention and other norms of international law, putting forward the absurd demand for "voluntary repatriation," attempting to forcibly detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel for their despicable purposes. While the American representatives at Panmunjom continued to repeat their so-called demands for "voluntary repatriation" and "re-screening," in the American prisoner-of-war camps, the U.S. side was carrying out bloody atrocities against our captured personnel who wished to return home.

    In the negotiations, the U.S. side repeatedly attempted to force us to accept their unreasonable demands, and recently barbarously bombed our hydroelectric power plants, which were not military targets, in an attempt to "influence" our delegation at Panmunjom and force our delegation to accept their demands. The intervention troops, unable to break through the People's Army's defense lines on the battlefront, wanted to use these actions of attacking civilians to vainly attempt to destroy the Korean people's will to resist aggression and expand the war. The failure to reach a final agreement in the negotiations for a year is entirely due to the sabotage by the U.S. side.

    Despite the enemy's policy of delaying and sabotaging the negotiations, our delegation at Panmunjom has done everything in its power to realize the sincere wishes of peace-loving people around the world—to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Chief U.S. delegate Harrison's future actions at the conference table will show to all countries around the world just how much real value his words have. The U.S. side must prove their talk of peace-loving and sincerity with concrete actions rather than empty words.

    If both sides accurately and faithfully abide by all the principles already agreed upon in the negotiations, and if both sides do not take unilateral actions when discussing the exchange of prisoners of war, then nothing can prevent the reaching of a final agreement. However, if the U.S. side continues their policy of delaying negotiations and obstructing success, they cannot escape responsibility for the consequences of such actions.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社  评停战谈判的一年

    评停战谈判的一年
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社平壤十一日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社为纪念朝鲜停战谈判一周年，发表文章，题为“侵略者在一年来的朝鲜停战谈判中企图获得的是什么？”文章写道：
    朝鲜停战谈判开始于去年七月十日。征服朝鲜的冒险计划的大失败，迫使美国侵略者在一年以前开始停战谈判。然而，在谈判的掩饰下，他们在前线进行了若干大攻势以及各种挑衅行动，使谈判陷于停顿。侵略者这些行动的目的，是为了要继续进行使华尔街的垄断集团获得巨额利润的朝鲜战争。
    美国人一再轰炸并以机枪扫射开城中立区，不时中断谈判。美方的侵略阴谋的最明显的证明是：干涉军在谈判期间在前线使用毒气和进行大规模的细菌战。在讨论议程中剩下的最后一个问题——交换战俘问题——期间，侵略者犯下了滔天的暴行——屠杀希望回国的我方被俘人员。
    美方在交换战俘问题上，无耻地破坏了日内瓦公约和国际法的其他准则，提出了“自愿遣返”的荒谬要求，企图由此强迫扣留十万以上我方被俘人员，供他们从事卑鄙的目的。当美国代表在板门店继续重复他们所谓“自愿遣返”和“重新甄别”的要求时，在美国战俘营中，美方对于希望回家的我方被俘人员，正在进行血腥暴行。
    在谈判中，美方一再企图强迫我方接受他们的无理要求，最近并野蛮地轰炸了并非军事目标的我方的水力发电厂，从而想“影响”我方在板门店的代表团，迫使我方代表团接受他们的要求。干涉军不能在战线上突破人民军的防御线，就想借助于这种攻击平民的行动，妄想摧毁朝鲜人民抵抗侵略的意志和扩大战争。一年来谈判没有获得最后协议，完全是美方的破坏所致。
    尽管敌方奉行拖延和破坏谈判的政策，但是我方在板门店的代表团竭尽全力来实现全世界爱好和平的人民的真挚愿望——使谈判圆满结束。美方代表团首席代表哈利逊今后在会议桌上的行动将向全世界各国表明，他的谈话，究竟有多少真正的价值。美方必须以具体行动而不是空口白舌来证明他们的关于爱好和平及诚意的谈话。
    如果双方准确而忠实地遵守一切已经在谈判中同意的原则，如果双方在讨论交换战俘问题时不采取片面行动，那么就没有东西能够阻碍最后协议的达成。但是，如果美方继续他们的拖延谈判与阻挠成功的政策，他们就不能逃避这种行动的后果的责任。
