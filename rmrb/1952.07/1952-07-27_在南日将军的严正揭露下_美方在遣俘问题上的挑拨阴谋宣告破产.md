Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 26th. The US side's shameless conspiracy to provoke the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people on the issue of prisoner repatriation, which they have been playing with, has been declared bankrupt due to the stern exposure by General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese delegation, in his speech on the 25th. General Nam Il pointed out: The figures for the number of prisoners to be repatriated and the classification figures put forward by the US side in the administrative meeting on July 13th still "attempt to detain 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war from my side's area and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war." The US side's proposed number of 83,000 prisoners to be repatriated is far from the approximate number of 116,000 that the US side itself admits should be repatriated. Moreover, General Nam Il sternly pointed out to the US representative: "The classification figures you have put forward contain a provocative conspiracy that you cannot tell anyone about, which is absolutely intolerable to our side."

Observers here believe that the US side's shameless conspiracy to provoke the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people on the issue of prisoner classification figures is very obvious. During the recent administrative meeting of the two delegations, the US side, on the one hand, put forward in the meeting the classification figures of the number of prisoners to be repatriated with ulterior motives, and on the other hand, repeatedly violated the agreement on the administrative meeting outside the meeting, revealing the content of the administrative meeting's discussions through their pro-US news agencies, and wantonly distorting the position of the Korean and Chinese delegations, in order to achieve the shameless purpose of provocation. The American "Newsweek" published on July 14th wrote: "Everyone knows that an agreement on Korean prisoners of war can be reached with the Communists at any time," "They are apparently willing to let North Korean prisoners of war determine their own destiny, but insist on repatriating 20,000 Chinese prisoners of war." A United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 20th also said: "Well-informed sources in Washington told United Press reporters that in secret meetings, ... the Communists suggested screening all Korean prisoners of war in the hands of the United Nations forces, but insisted on repatriating, and if necessary, forcibly repatriating all 20,000 Chinese prisoners." Without explanation, people can see at a glance what shameful purpose the US side is trying to achieve through this rumor-mongering and provocative propaganda. On the 25th, after General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese delegation, had sternly exposed this ulterior provocative conspiracy of the US side, the US side was still reluctant to abandon this deceptive propaganda that had been exposed. The American "Tokyo Military Radio Station" said in its broadcast on the afternoon of the 25th when mentioning the administrative meeting that had ended: "The Communists seem to be more concerned about the repatriation of Chinese prisoners than about the repatriation of North Korean prisoners."

The US side itself probably feels that this provocative deceptive propaganda has reached a level of absurdity and shame that it cannot be formally seen, so it does not dare to formally come forward to spread this deceptive propaganda through official channels, but only spreads it through its pro-US propaganda organs in an irresponsible manner. In the official communiqués and meeting records officially published by the US side, the US side had to reveal the truth of the matter, thus slapping itself in the face. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 25th: The "United Nations Command" in Tokyo admitted in a communiqué issued on the 25th regarding the administrative meeting: The real crux of the difference between the two delegations is nothing else but the US side's continued insistence on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, which has long been bankrupt and violates the Geneva Convention. The communiqué also had to admit that the attitude of the Korean and Chinese delegation was based on the principles of the Geneva Convention, "insisting on negotiations on the basis of repatriating all prisoners of war." At the same time, according to an Associated Press Munsan dispatch on the 25th, the meeting record unilaterally published by the US side also had to admit: The position of the Korean and Chinese delegation, "mainly reiterated the Communists' previous claims, that is: all foreign prisoners (Chinese prisoners and United Nations prisoners) must be fully exchanged, and Korean prisoners can be exchanged based on their home addresses."

Everyone knows that in order to quickly resolve the fourth item on the agenda and realize the Korean armistice as soon as possible, the Korean and Chinese delegation made another effort at the staff meeting on the fourth item on the agenda on March 27th, and proposed suggestions on the principles for specific repatriation adjustment, that is: the Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, the South Korean army or Korean People's Army prisoners of war, only those whose homes are in the area of the receiving party can go home locally and do not need to be repatriated, while the foreign armed personnel captured by both sides (that is, the United Nations army or Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war), and the Korean prisoners of war whose homes are in the original party's area, must be fully repatriated home to live a peaceful life. The principle held by the Korean and Chinese delegation is unshakable. The position of the Korean and Chinese delegation in this administrative meeting is precisely based on this principle, suggesting that the prisoners of war on both sides be reclassified according to nationality and region, and the list of prisoners of war exchanged by both sides on December 18th last year be corrected, so as to solve the problem realistically.

The Chinese and Korean people are sincerely seeking an early realization of the Korean armistice in order to meet the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world. However, the American aggressors have once again proved that they are nothing but liars and conspirators. On July 1, they feigned a willingness to negotiate on the issue of prisoner repatriation, the only remaining issue in the Korean armistice negotiations. But the facts show that they not only overturned their willingness to negotiate, but also used the secret nature of the administrative meeting to carry out shameless deceptive propaganda in an attempt to provoke the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people, thereby achieving their conspiracy to detain a large number of our prisoners of war under unreasonable plans.

Observers here pointed out that the brotherly and close unity of the Chinese and Korean people, which is condensed with blood, can never be shaken. After all kinds of deceptive conspiracies have suffered failures, the American aggressors have even fantasized about trying to provoke the unbreakable brotherly unity of the Chinese and Korean people. People really did not expect that the American aggressors have degenerated to such a despicable level. Now, General Nam Il's stern exposure has declared this conspiracy of the US side bankrupt, and let's see what new tricks the American aggressors can come up with.

### 在南日将军的严正揭露下  美方在遣俘问题上的挑拨阴谋宣告破产

    在南日将军的严正揭露下
    美方在遣俘问题上的挑拨阴谋宣告破产
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美方在遣返战俘问题上所玩弄的妄图挑拨朝中两国人民亲密团结的无耻阴谋，由于朝中代表团首席代表南日将军在二十五日发言中的严正揭露，已宣告破产。南日将军指出：美方七月十三日在行政性会议中所提出的遣俘概数和分类数字，仍然“企图扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军家在我方地区的被俘人员和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军被俘人员”。美方所提出的八万三千人的遣俘概数，和美方自己所承认的应予遣返的近似数十一万六千人相距很远。而且，南日将军对美方代表严正指出：“你方所提出的分类数字，更包藏着你方不可告人的挑拨阴谋，为我方所绝对不能容忍。”
    此间观察家认为，美方在遣俘分类数字问题上妄图挑拨朝中两国人民亲密团结的无耻阴谋是十分显然的。在最近一次双方代表团大会行政性会议进行期间，美方一方面在会内提出别有企图的遣俘概数的分类数字，一方面在会外一再破坏关于行政性会议的协议，通过他们御用的新闻机构透露行政性会议的讨论内容，并对朝中代表团的立场肆意歪曲，以图达到无耻挑拨的目的。七月十四日出版的美国
    “新闻周刊”写道：“大家都知道关于朝鲜战俘的协定可以随时与共方获得协议”，“他们显然愿意听由北朝鲜战俘自定其命运，但坚持遣返二万中国战俘。”合众社东京二十日电也说：“华盛顿的消息灵通人士对合众社记者说，在秘密会议上，……共方曾建议甄别联军手中所有的朝鲜战俘，但是坚持遣返、必要时得强迫遣返两万中国俘虏的全部。”不用解释，人们一眼就可以看出美方企图通过这种造谣挑拨的欺骗宣传来达到什么可耻的目的。二十五日，在朝中代表团首席代表南日将军已经严正地揭露了美方这一不可告人的挑拨阴谋之后，美方还舍不得放弃这种已被戳穿了的欺骗宣传。美国的“东京军中电台”二十五日下午的广播在提到已经结束的行政性会议时说：“共方似乎关怀中国俘虏之遣返多于关怀北朝鲜俘虏。”
    美方自己大概也感觉这种挑拨性的欺骗宣传，其荒谬可耻达到了不能正式见人的程度，因此不敢由官方正式出面来散布这种欺骗宣传，仅由其御用的宣传机关用不负责任的方式来散布。而在美方官方所正式发表的公报和会议纪录中，美方不得不泄露了事情的真相，因而自己打了自己的耳光。据路透社东京二十五日电：在东京的“联合国军司令部”二十五日发表的关于行政性会议的公报承认：双方代表团之间的分歧的真正症结，并不是别的，而是美方仍然坚持早已破产了的违反日内瓦公约的所谓“自愿遣返”原则。公报也不得不承认，朝中代表团的态度是根据日内瓦公约的原则，“坚持要在遣返全部战俘的基础上进行谈判。”同时，据美联社汶山二十五日电，美方所片面发表的会议纪录，也不得不承认：朝中代表团的立场，“主要是重申共方以前的主张，即：所有外国俘虏（中国俘虏和联合国俘虏）必须全部交换，朝鲜俘虏可以在他们家乡地址的基础上进行交换。”
    大家都知道：朝中代表团为了迅速解决第四项议程，早日实现朝鲜停战，三月二十七日在第四项议程参谋会上曾作再一次的努力，提出了关于具体遣返的调整原则的建议，即：双方所俘获的朝鲜籍武装人员，即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，只有家在收容一方地区者，可以就地回家，不必遣返，而双方所俘获的外国武装人员（即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员），以及家在原属一方地区的朝鲜籍被俘人员，必须全部遣返回家过和平生活。朝中代表团所持的这一原则，是不可动摇的。朝中代表团在这次行政性会议中的立场，正是根据这一原则，建议按照国籍和地区对双方战俘进行重新分类，并校正去年十二月十八日双方交换的战俘名单，以便实事求是地解决问题。
    朝中人民为了符合世界人民的和平愿望，真心诚意地谋求早日实现朝鲜停战。但是，美国侵略者却再一次证明他们不过是骗子和阴谋家。他们在七月一日对于朝鲜停战谈判中唯一剩余的战俘遣返问题，假意表示了愿意协商的态度。但事实说明：他们不仅推翻了愿意进行协商的表示，而且更利用行政性会议的秘密性质，进行无耻的欺骗宣传，妄图挑拨朝中人民的亲密团结，从而达到其扣留我方大批战俘的无理方案的阴谋目的。
    此间观察家指出：朝中两国人民以鲜血凝成的兄弟般的亲密团结，是永远也无法动摇的。美国侵略者在各种欺骗阴谋都遭受了失败之后，竟然异想天开地企图挑拨朝中人民如此牢不可破的兄弟团结。人们实在没有料到美国侵略者已经堕落到如此卑鄙的地步。现在，南日将军的严正揭露，已使美方这
    一阴谋宣告破产，且看美国侵略者还能够想出什么样的新计谋来。
