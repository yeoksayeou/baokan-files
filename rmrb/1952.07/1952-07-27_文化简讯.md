    Achievements in Rural Health Work in Western Sichuan
    The rural health situation in the Western Sichuan area has undergone significant changes. Over the past year, farmers throughout the region, under the slogan of "Healthy People and Livestock, Guaranteed Increased Production," have launched multiple large-scale clean-up and sanitation campaigns. According to incomplete statistics, over 110,000 rural toilets have been improved, more than 31,000 drinking water ponds and wells have been dredged, and over 50,000 tons of accumulated garbage have been cleared. Many township restaurants, teahouses, and barbershops have added sanitary facilities in accordance with the provisions of the sanitation covenants. In addition, the infant mortality rate in rural Western Sichuan has been greatly reduced. According to typical surveys in Guanghan, Shifang, Peng County and other places, due to the widespread adoption of new midwifery methods by farmers, the infant mortality rate has dropped from about 50% before liberation to about 3%. The mortality rate of pigs and cattle has also decreased by 40% to 75% compared to the past.

    Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Excavates Artifacts from the Warring States Period
    From May 21 to June 24, the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered ancient tombs from the Warring States period in Jiagezhuang, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and excavated a batch of artifacts from the State of Yan. These artifacts are rare in various places and are of great value for studying ancient Chinese history. The excavated artifacts are divided into two categories: one is pottery and funerary objects from the Warring States period, mainly including four types: "Ding," "Dou," "Hu," and "Yi"; the other is bronzes, including weapons such as swords, ge halberds, spears, and arrowheads, and household furniture such as "Ding," "Dou," "Hu," "Yi," and "Dui." Among these precious unearthed artifacts, some pottery styles are unique, and some bronze patterns are exquisite and delicate, which can be inferred to the prosperous culture two thousand two to three hundred years ago. According to archaeological experts, the Tangshan area was a relatively concentrated area of residence for the people of the State of Yan during the Warring States period, and many valuable artifacts may still be buried underground. The Tangshan Municipal People's Government and the Archaeological Institute held an exhibition of these artifacts at the Municipal People's Cultural Center to educate citizens to cherish cultural relics.

    川西农村卫生工作有成绩
    川西区农村卫生情况已发生显著变化。一年来，全区农民在“人畜健康、保证增产”的口号下，曾开展了多次规模巨大的清洁卫生运动。据不完全统计：各地改善了农村厕所十一万多所，掏浚了饮水塘和水井三万一千多口，清除了历年积存的垃圾五万多吨。很多乡镇的饭铺、茶馆、理发店都按卫生公约的规定添置了卫生设备。此外，川西农村的婴儿出生死亡率已大为减少。据广汉、什邡、彭县等地的典型调查，由于农民普遍采用了新法接生，婴儿出生死亡率已由解放前的百分之五十降低到百分之三左右。猪、牛死亡率也比过去减少百分之四十至七十五。
    中国科学院考古研究所发掘出战国时代古物
    中国科学院考古研究所，从五月二十一日到六月二十四日在河北省唐山市贾各庄发现战国古墓，发掘出一批燕国的古物。这批古物为各地所少见，对于研究中国的古代史很有价值。发掘的古物共分两种：一种是战国时代的陶器和殉葬明器，主要的有“鼎”、“豆”、“壶”、“彝”四类；另一种是铜器，有剑、戈、矛、镞等武器和“鼎”、“豆”、“壶”、“匜”、“敦”等日用家具。在这些珍贵的出土古物中，有的陶器式样特殊，有的铜器上的花纹精美纤巧，可以推想到在两千二、三百年前文化繁荣的情况。据考古专家谈：唐山一带是战国时代燕国人民居住比较集中的地区，地下还可能埋藏着很多珍贵的古物。唐山市人民政府和考古研究所为教育市民爱护古物，曾将这一批古物在市人民文化馆举行展览。
