The crash planting campaign launched in major winter wheat producing areas of China, including northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Pingyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces and regions after the wheat harvest, concluded before July 10th. These regions have successfully completed their summer planting plans.

Summer planting crops occupy a very important position in agricultural production in these regions. In the five provinces of northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Pingyuan, the summer planting area accounts for more than 45 percent of the cultivated land. In the remaining provinces, the summer planting area also accounts for a considerable proportion of the cultivated land. Summer planting crops are mostly food crops such as corn, millet, sorghum, and sweet potatoes, as well as oil crops such as beans, which constitute an important part of the autumn harvest crops. The timing of summer planting has a great impact on the yield. Farmers say, "Planting late for a while means harvesting three days later," and "A late autumn means an early wheat harvest, resulting in a 30% thinner crop." Therefore, seizing the time and completing summer planting as early as possible is a key to realizing the agricultural production increase plan.

Summer harvesting, summer plowing, and summer planting are precisely the busiest seasons for agricultural work. This year's climatic conditions are also very unfavorable for summer planting: rainfall was extremely scarce for more than a month before and after the wheat harvest, and some areas had not received significant rain since spring planting, adding serious difficulties to summer planting. Therefore, in order to seize the time and plant as early as possible, it was necessary to overcome difficulties and plant continuously. Due to the different conditions before and after the rain (June 25th), the planting work can be divided into two stages: before and after the rain. In the pre-rain period, except for a few counties and districts in southern Shandong, southern Henan, and the Liaocheng and Huxi special districts in eastern Pingyuan, which had one or two light rains and could seize the moisture to plant some summer crops, most areas had to irrigate for planting due to the severe drought. At that time, the topsoil in general cultivated land was dry to a depth of three or four inches to seven or eight inches, the river flow was extremely small, and the groundwater level had generally dropped by two or three feet. Not only was dryland planting difficult, but also in canal and well irrigation areas, guaranteeing complete planting required arduous struggle. In order to avoid delaying the planting season and strive for an autumn harvest, local Party committees and governments promptly shifted their focus of work to leading summer planting, calling on farmers to utilize all conditions to actively launch a drought resistance campaign. Many heads of special districts and counties personally led large numbers of cadres to go deep into the countryside to specifically lead the drought resistance work. During this period, in Pingyuan province alone, the Anyang, Huxi, Puyang, and Liaocheng special districts had six secretaries of the district party committee and commissioners, most county party secretaries and county heads, and more than 7,000 cadres from the district and county levels participating in the drought resistance struggle in the countryside. Tongxu County in Henan Province and the Taikang, Fugou, and Xiangcheng three counties under the Huaiyang Special District organized a strong drought resistance shock team of nearly 4,000 people respectively, stationed in various districts and villages, using methods such as calculating seasons, comparing yields, recounting the suffering from drought disasters, introducing drought resistance experiences, and mobilizing key personnel to take the lead to break the farmers' negative emotions and persuade them to summon the courage to overcome difficulties and resolutely carry out the drought resistance struggle. Subsequently, vigorous drought resistance movements unfolded in various places. Farmers in irrigation areas adopted various methods to improve irrigation efficiency, overcome the difficulty of water shortage, expand the irrigated area, and ensure that all areas were planted. For example, the Anyang and Xinxiang special districts in Pingyuan province, which are relatively developed in irrigation, strengthened irrigation management during the summer harvest and launched a patriotic water conservation movement. Farmers in canal irrigation areas reaped wheat on one side and irrigated on the other. Farmers in general well irrigation areas threshed wheat in the afternoon and irrigated in the morning, striving to ensure that both summer harvest and summer planting were not delayed. After the end of the summer harvest, round-the-clock irrigation was generally implemented, ensuring that water did not stop when people rested. In areas with insufficient well water, measures were taken to dig wells while irrigating in order to expand water sources and ensure the amount of water required for summer planting. In areas without irrigation equipment, the masses were mobilized to launch a crash well-digging campaign and carry water for spot planting. In mid-June, a high tide of well-digging was launched in various parts of Henan. Thirty-four counties in Henan Province dug more than 128,000 wells during the wheat harvest. The Fuyang and Su County special districts in northern Anhui dug more than 187,000 wells. Local water conservancy promotion societies or cooperatives promptly supplied a large number of waterwheels, which strongly supported the drought resistance work. During the summer planting period, Pingyuan province alone lent and sold more than 12,400 waterwheels, equivalent to 87 percent of the total supply for the previous year. In order to overcome the shortage of manpower, temporary mutual aid organizations were expanded or developed on the basis of existing labor mutual aid in various places, and manpower that had not participated in mutual aid organizations was widely absorbed to implement water carrying and spot planting. It has become a very common phenomenon for the old and weak to go to the fields for spot planting. By the time it rained, Henan Province had completed 40 percent of its summer planting plan, and Pingyuan Province had planted more than 6.5 million mu of drought-resistant crops. Other provinces have achieved great results.

On June 25th, rain fell successively in various places. On June 26th, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Urgent Mobilization to Launch a Drought Resistance Struggle," and summer planting immediately entered an unprecedentedly tense stage. When the rain fell, Party committees and governments in various places immediately convened emergency meetings, decided to stop all work that could be stopped, and concentrated all their efforts to lead farmers to seize the moisture and rush to plant. On the second day of the rainfall, Pingyuan Province sent an additional 15,000 cadres to lead the rush planting. Within two hours of the start of the rainfall, the Chenliu Special District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Special Commissioner's Office of Henan Province sent four working groups to the counties in the rain to assist in carrying out the rush planting campaign.

The correct call of the Party and the People's Government was warmly responded to by the masses. The farmers' enthusiasm for rush planting was very high. In Qu Xingzhen, Chenliu County, Henan Province, more than 3,000 farmers rushed to plant sweet potatoes in the rain. In Teng County Special District of Shandong, many farmers were sowing in the rain. In Dangshan County, northern Anhui, farmers rushed to plant in the rain during the day and studied techniques at night. The progress of summer planting was very rapid, and generally all summer planting was completed within five to seven days after the rain.

When some areas began crash planting, they felt that there was a shortage of agricultural tools, animal power, and seeds. Due to the widespread implementation of mutual borrowing of agricultural tools, mutual exchange of seeds, and labor exchange and mutual assistance, the rational organization and allocation of manpower and materials ensured the smooth progress of planting. Cooperatives, grain companies, and other institutions in various places promptly supplied a large number of seeds, providing great convenience to farmers and solving the difficulties of seed shortage in some areas. In order to supply seeds in a timely manner, many economic departments were open day and night to ensure that farmers could buy them as soon as they arrived, and combined seed sales with procurement operations to facilitate farmers to exchange and purchase; some also implemented seed sales in the countryside, which strongly supported summer planting.

    全国主要产麦区胜利完成夏播计划
    我国主要冬麦产区苏北、皖北、山东、河南、平原、河北、山西、陕西等省区在麦收后展开的抢种运动，已于七月十日以前结束。这些地区已胜利完成了夏播计划。
    夏播作物在这些地区的农业生产中，占有很重要的地位。苏北、皖北、河南、山东、平原等五省区夏播面积占耕地百分之四十五以上，其余几省夏播面积也占耕地的相当大的比重。夏播作物多为玉蜀黍、谷（粟）、高粱、甘薯等粮食作物和豆类等油料作物，占秋收作物的重要部分。夏播的迟早，对收获量有绝大的影响。农民说：“迟种一晌，晚收三天”“迟秋早麦，一收三薄”。因此，争取时间，及早完成夏播，是实现农业增产计划的重要关键。
    夏收、夏耕、夏播，正是农事繁忙的季节，而今年的气候条件，对夏播又十分不利：麦收前后一个多月降雨极少，有些地区春播以后一直未得透雨，给夏播增添了严重的困难。因此，为了争取时间及早下种，必须克服困难，连续抢种。由于落雨（六月二十五日）前后情况不同，播种工作可分为雨前雨后两个阶段。雨前阶段，除山东、河南南部和平原东部聊城、湖西两专区少数县区，曾落一两场小雨，可趁墒抢种一部分夏播作物外，大部地区因旱象严重，必须进行浇水播种。当时一般耕地表土干达三、四寸至七、八寸深，河水流量极小，井水水位普遍下降二、三尺，不但旱地播种困难，渠道水井灌区，要保证全部播种，也需进行艰苦斗争。各地党委和政府为了不误播种季节，争取秋季丰收，及时将工作重心转向领导夏播，号召农民利用一切条件，积极展开抗旱斗争。很多专区和县的首长，亲自带领大批干部，深入农村，具体领导抗旱工作。在这一时期，仅平原省安阳、湖西、濮阳、聊城等四个专区，就有地委书记、专员六人、大多数县委书记、县长和专区、县两级干部七千多人，下乡参加抗旱斗争。河南省通许县和淮阳专区所属太康、扶沟、项城三县，分别组织了近四千人的强大抗旱突击队，分驻各区村，运用算季节，比产量，诉旱灾苦，介绍抗旱经验，动员骨干带头等办法，打破农民的消极情绪，说服农民鼓起勇气，战胜困难，坚决进行抗旱斗争。各地遂相继展开轰轰烈烈的抗旱运动。灌溉区农民采取了各种办法，提高灌溉效率，克服缺水的困难，扩大了灌溉面积，保证了灌溉区全部下种。例如灌溉比较发达的平原省安阳、新乡两专区，在夏收期间就加强了灌溉管理工作，开展了爱国节水运动。渠道灌区的农民，一边收麦、一边浇地。一般水井灌区的农民，下午打麦、上午浇地，争取夏收夏播两不误。夏收结束以后，普遍实行昼夜轮浇，作到人停水不停。在井水不足的地区，采取了一面浇地、一面掏井的办法，以便扩大水源，保证供应夏播所需的水量。在无灌溉设备地区是发动群众，突击打井，担水点种。河南各地在六月中旬先后发起打井的高潮。河南有三十四县在麦收期间打井十二万八千余眼。皖北阜阳、宿县两专区打井十八万七千多眼。各地水利推进社或合作社及时供应大量水车，有力地支援了抗旱工作。平原一省在夏播期间贷、售水车一万二千四百余辆，相当去年全年供应数量的百分之八十七。为了克服人力不足的现象，各地在现有的劳动互助基础上，扩大或发展了临时性的互助组织，广泛吸收没有参加互助组织的人力，实行担水点种。老弱下地点种，已成很普遍的现象。到雨前止，河南全省已完成夏播计划的百分之四十，平原省抗旱播种六百五十多万亩。其他各省都获得很大成绩。
    六月二十五日，各地陆续降雨，六月二十六日中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于紧急动员起来开展抗旱斗争的指示”，夏播立即进入空前紧张阶段。各地党委、政府在降雨时，立即召开紧急会议，决定停止一切可以停止的工作，集中全力领导农民趁墒抢种。平原省于降雨的第二天，增派领导抢种的干部达一万五千人，河南省陈留专区中共地委和专署于降雨开始后二小时内，就派出四个工作组，冒雨赶到各县协助开展抢种运动。
    党和人民政府正确的号召，得到群众的热烈响应。农民抢种的情绪十分高涨。河南省陈留县曲兴镇一镇就有三千多个农民冒雨抢种甘薯，山东滕县专区各县很多农民在雨中耩地，皖北砀山县农民白天冒雨抢种，晚上研究技术。夏播进度很快，一般雨后五天到七天就完成了全部夏播。
    若干地区开始突击播种时，曾感到农具、畜力、种籽不足，由于广泛地实行了互借农具、互换种籽和变工互助，合理地组织调配了人力物力，保证了播种顺利进行。各地合作社、粮食公司等机构，及时大量供应种籽，给予农民极大便利，解决了某些地区缺乏种籽的困难。许多经济部门为了及时供应种籽，昼夜营业，保证农民随到随买，并结合售种，开展收购业务，以便农民换购；有的并实行下乡售种，有力地支持了夏播。（徐达）
