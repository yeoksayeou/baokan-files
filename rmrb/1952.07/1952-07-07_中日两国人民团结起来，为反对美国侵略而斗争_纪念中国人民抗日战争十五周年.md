    Unite, Chinese and Japanese People, and Fight Against American Aggression
    — Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan
    Today is the fifteenth anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan. Fifteen years ago, the Chinese people, under the insane and brutal armed aggression of Japanese imperialism, faced the disaster of national subjugation and genocide. Over the past fifteen years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have not only gone through the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, defeated Japanese imperialism, but also gone through the three-year War of Liberation, crushed the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, established the People's Republic of China, and embarked on the broad road of New Democratic construction.
    After the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan and the World People's Anti-Fascist War, the failure and collapse of the three fascists, Germany, Japan, and Italy, have already caused serious changes in the entire imperialist camp. At the same time, as the two imperialist powers, Britain and France, have become increasingly weakened, American imperialism has gained the so-called "hegemony" in the entire imperialist camp. As far as Asia is concerned, the remnants of the Japanese imperialist group, which suffered defeat and collapsed in the Second World War, have already fallen into the role of lackeys and accomplices of American imperialism. American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism as the chief culprit in the aggression against Asia. Japan and the Japanese people have inevitably become the objects of American imperialism's mad aggression. Due to the signing and declared "effective" of the Treaty of San Francisco, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and the Administrative Agreement, what Japan and the Japanese people have gained is not independence and freedom, but long-term military occupation; not peace and democracy, but a growing war crisis and a darker reactionary rule; not prosperity, but poverty. Just as the Japanese imperialist aggression against China was the most serious national crisis in Chinese history, the American imperialist aggression against Japan and the Japanese people today is undoubtedly the most serious national crisis in Japanese history.
    However, today, the remnant group of Japanese imperialism, headed by Yoshida, dares to openly regard selling itself to American imperialism as a good strategy in the face of the unprecedentedly serious national crisis in Japanese history caused by American imperialism's aggression. After the ultimate failure of its decades of continuous aggression against China, the remnant group of Japanese imperialism not only has no intention of repenting, but instead goes mad, unscrupulously colluding with American imperialism, vainly attempting to continue its decades of shameless conspiracy of armed aggression against China and Asia, attempting to revive militarism and rebuild its imperialist rule over China and the Asian people. That is to say, the remnant group of Japanese imperialism not only has not the slightest sincerity to end the state of war it has waged against the Chinese people since the September 18th Incident in 1931 and the July 7th Incident in 1937, but vainly attempts to rely on the support of American imperialism to maintain this state of war, refusing to live in peace with the Chinese people, so as to participate in the new war of aggression that American imperialism conspires to provoke at any time. After signing the Treaty of San Francisco with American imperialism, the Yoshida government immediately signed a treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary remnant group, which had long been unanimously rejected by the Chinese people, according to the orders of American imperialism. This is another ironclad proof that the remnant group of Japanese imperialism is hostile to the People's Republic of China and plotting to re-attack the Chinese people. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly stated that it is willing to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with the Allied countries that fought against Japan during the Second World War as soon as possible on the basis of the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, in order to guarantee peace and security in the Far East and Asia. The reactionary remnant group of Japanese imperialism is completely unwilling to abide by these international covenants that can guarantee independence, freedom, peace, and democracy for Japan and the Japanese people, and dares to rely solely on American imperialism to destroy these covenants one by one; even the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan, which were based on these covenants, have been forced to dissolve with extremely despicable means, assisting American imperialism. This proves that the Japanese government has not complied in the slightest with the international obligations and constraints it should have complied with since its surrender in September 1945. There is no doubt that the post-surrender Japanese government, like the American government, bears serious responsibility for its unilateral and illegal actions in violating solemn international covenants. The remnant group of Japanese imperialism's destruction of these international covenants and the signing of a unilateral treaty are completely contrary to the interests of the Japanese people. The Chinese people and our Central People's Government have consistently adhered to these international covenants and advocated the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty, which is entirely in the interests of the Japanese people.
    The Chinese people have always distinguished very clearly between imperialists and the people in imperialist countries. The Chinese people know deeply that the remnant group of Japanese imperialism, acting as a running dog for American imperialism, cannot represent the Japanese people in the slightest. The Chinese people once again express to the Japanese people: We hope to live in peace with the Japanese people, unite in friendship, trade with each other, and mutually respect the integrity of territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people hope that Japan will become an independent, free, peaceful, democratic, and economically prosperous country. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the collusion between American imperialism and the remnant group of Japanese imperialism to use the so-called Treaty of San Francisco, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and the Administrative Agreement to keep American troops stationed in Japan for a long time and implement colonial rule over the Japanese people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the collusion between American imperialism and the remnant group of Japanese imperialism to expand armaments in Japan, strangle Japan's peaceful production, deepen Japan's economic crisis, and worsen the lives of the Japanese people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the American conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a military base, oppose the American war policy that brings disaster to the Asian people and sends Japan and the Japanese people on the path of destruction and death.
    For several years, under the threat of the collusion between American imperialism and the remnant group of Japanese imperialism to re-prepare for a war of aggression, the Japanese people have continuously carried out heroic struggles. The Japanese people once called April 28, 1952, the day the Treaty of San Francisco came into effect, a day of national humiliation. Japanese workers, farmers, progressive intellectuals, as well as women and youth, have launched a national liberation struggle throughout the country for the purpose of opposing American imperialist aggression, opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and for the independence, freedom, peace, and democracy of their motherland. The large-scale demonstration of Japanese working people on May Day this year is a manifestation of the continued upsurge of the Japanese people's patriotic movement. In this patriotic movement, which is widespread throughout the country, the Japanese people have put forward slogans such as "Oppose rearmament and strive for national independence," "Oppose the separate treaty, the security treaty, and the administrative agreement," "American soldiers get out," and "Down with the Yoshida government." The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and enthusiastically support the patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. Because we have been constantly subjected to cruel aggression by imperialism, including Japanese imperialism, for more than a hundred years, and because of our personal experience in the Chinese people's national liberation struggle, we fully understand how arduous the task of the Japanese people today in opposing American imperialist aggression and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism is. However, we firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Japanese people. Today, as the Chinese people are reviewing the experience of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese people can also learn these experiences from the Chinese people. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people constantly called on the people of China and Japan to unite and jointly oppose Japanese imperialism's war of aggression. Today, at the extremely critical historical juncture of the Japanese people's national crisis, the Chinese people are willing to call once again: Unite, Chinese and Japanese people, and fight against American imperialist aggression and the revival of Japanese militarism! As long as the people of China and Japan unite and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to achieve victory.

### 中日两国人民团结起来，为反对美国侵略而斗争——纪念中国人民抗日战争十五周年

    中日两国人民团结起来，为反对美国侵略而斗争
    ——纪念中国人民抗日战争十五周年
    今天是中国人民抗日战争十五周年的纪念日。十五年前，中国人民在日本帝国主义疯狂残暴的武装侵略之下，面临着亡国灭种的大祸。十五年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，不仅经过了八年抗日战争，打败了日本帝国主义，而且经过了三年解放战争，打垮了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的长期反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国，走上了新民主主义建设的康庄大道。
    中国人民抗日战争和世界人民反法西斯战争胜利以后，德、日、意三个法西斯的失败和崩溃，业已使得整个帝国主义阵营发生了严重的变化。同时，由于英、法两个帝国主义日益削弱，美帝国主义就获得了整个帝国主义阵营中的所谓“霸权”。就亚洲来说，在第二次世界大战中遭受失败和陷于崩溃的日本帝国主义残余集团，业已降落成为美帝国主义的仆从和帮凶。美帝国主义业已代替日本帝国主义成为侵略亚洲的罪魁祸首。日本和日本人民也不可避免地成为美帝国主义疯狂侵略的对象。由于旧金山和约、美日安全条约和行政协定的签订并被宣布“生效”，日本和日本人民所得到的，不是独立与自由，而是长期的军事占领；不是和平与民主，而是日益增长的战争危机与更加黑暗的反动统治；不是繁荣，而是穷困。正如日本帝国主义当年对中国的侵略是中国历史上最严重的民族危机一样，美帝国主义今天对于日本和日本人民的侵略，毫无疑义地是日本历史上最严重的一次民族危机。
    然而，今天以吉田为首的日本帝国主义残余集团，面对着由于美帝国主义侵略所造成的日本历史上空前严重的民族危机，竟敢公然以向美帝国主义卖身投靠为得计。日本帝国主义残余集团在其数十年来不断侵略中国的罪行终于失败之后，不仅毫无悔祸之意，反而丧心病狂，不惜奴颜婢膝地勾结美帝国主义，妄想继续其数十年来武装侵略中国、侵略亚洲的无耻阴谋，企图复活军国主义，重建其对于中国和亚洲人民的帝国主义统治。这就是说，日本帝国主义残余集团不仅没有丝毫诚意结束它从一九三一年九一八事变和一九三七年七七事变以来对中国人民实行武装侵略的战争状态，反而妄图依靠美帝国主义的扶植，保持这种战争状态，拒绝与中国人民和平相处，以便随时参加美帝国主义阴谋挑起的新侵略战争。吉田政府在与美帝国主义签订旧金山和约之后，立即按照美帝国主义的命令，与早为中国人民所一致唾弃的蒋介石反动残余集团签订条约，这就是日本帝国主义残余集团敌视中华人民共和国并阴谋重新进攻中国人民的又一铁证。这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾经屡次声明，愿在一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言及开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和协定的基础之上，与第二次世界战争期间对日作战的同盟国家早日缔结全面对日和约，以便保障远东和亚洲的和平与安全。日本帝国主义反动残余集团，对于这些足以为日本和日本人民保证独立、自由、和平、民主的国际盟约，完全不肯遵守，竟敢一味依靠美帝国主义，对这些盟约一一加以破坏；甚至对基于这些盟约所产生的远东委员会和盟国对日委员会，都用极其卑鄙的手段，协助美帝国主义，强迫加以解散。这就证明日本政府自从一九四五年九月投降以来，丝毫没有遵守在其投降后所应遵守的国际义务和约束。毫无疑义，投降后的日本政府和美国政府一样，对于他们破坏庄严的国际盟约所进行的片面的、非法的举动，负有严重的责任。日本帝国主义残余集团破坏这些国际盟约，签订片面和约，是完全违反日本人民利益的。中国人民和我国中央人民政府一贯坚持这些国际盟约，主张签订全面和平条约，则是完全符合日本人民利益的。
    中国人民对于帝国主义者和帝国主义国家中的人民一向是区别得异常清楚的。中国人民深知，替美帝国主义充当走狗的日本帝国主义残余集团丝毫不能代表日本人民。中国人民再一次向日本人民表示：我们希望与日本人民和平相处，友好团结，互通贸易，互相尊重领土主权的完整。中国人民希望日本成为一个独立自由、和平民主、经济繁荣的国家。中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义和日本帝国主义残余集团勾结起来，利用所谓旧金山和约、美日安全条约及行政协定，将美国军队长期留驻日本，对日本人民实行殖民地的统治。中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义和日本帝国主义残余集团勾结起来在日本扩张军备，绞杀日本的和平生产，加深日本的经济危机，并使日本人民的生活更加恶化。中国人民坚决反对美国复活日本军国主义变日本为军事基地的阴谋，反对美国给亚洲人民带来灾难、将日本和日本人民送上毁灭和死亡道路的战争政策。
    数年来，日本人民在美帝国主义和日本帝国主义残余集团勾结起来重新准备侵略战争的威胁之下，曾经不断地进行了英勇的斗争。日本人民曾经将旧金山和约生效的一九五二年四月二十八日那一天，称为国耻日。日本的工人、农民、进步的知识分子以及妇女和青年，为了反对美帝国主义的侵略，为了反对日本军国主义的复活，为了自己祖国的独立、自由、和平与民主，业已在全国各地普遍展开了民族解放斗争。今年“五一”节日本劳动人民的大示威，就是日本人民爱国运动继续高涨的表现。在这个普遍于全国各地的爱国运动中，日本人民提出了“反对重整军备，争取民族独立”、“反对单独和约、安全条约和行政协定”、“美国兵滚回去”、
    “打倒吉田政府”等口号。中国人民对于日本人民爱国主义的斗争，是深切同情，热烈支持的。由于我们百余年来不断遭受帝国主义，包括日本帝国主义在内的残酷侵略，由于我们在中国人民民族解放斗争中的亲身体验，我们完全理解：日本人民今天反对美帝国主义侵略、反对日本军国主义复活的斗争任务是如何艰巨，然而我们坚定地相信：胜利一定是属于日本人民的。在中国人民温习抗日战争经验的今天，日本人民同样可以从中国人民的身上学习这些经验。早在抗日战争时期，中国人民就曾不断号召中日两国人民团结起来，共同反对日本帝国主义进行侵略战争。今天在日本人民的民族危机极为严重的历史关头，中国人民愿意再一次号召：中日两国人民团结起来，为反对美帝国主义侵略、反对日本军国主义复活而斗争！只要中日两国人民团结起来，坚持斗争，就一定能够获得胜利。
