    Resolutely Support Johnson's Just Actions
    After a seven-week visit to our country, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, has returned to London. On the 8th, Archbishop Johnson held a press conference in London and, on the 10th, issued a statement in response to the slander by the British bourgeois newspapers. He listed many irrefutable pieces of evidence to expose and accuse the American aggressors of conducting germ warfare in Korea and our country. This just action powerfully struck at the germ warfare crimes of the American aggressors and directly contributed to the cause of defending world peace. All peace-loving people cannot but express respect and provide resolute and strong support for Johnson's spirit of upholding justice and defending peace.
    Just as with the situation Mrs. Felton encountered after exposing the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea last year, Archbishop Johnson has also been subjected to slander and persecution by the British ruling group after condemning American germ warfare. The British ruling group, as an accomplice of the American aggression in Korea, has consistently adopted an attitude of sophistry and concealment regarding the germ warfare crimes of the United States, and has tried its best to slander the anti-germ warfare struggle of the Korean and Chinese people in order to deceive the vast number of peace-loving people in Britain. Now, when a fair-minded British person holds solid evidence of American germ warfare and speaks out, the British ruling group shows extreme panic and unease, and hurriedly mobilizes all its reactionary newspapers to clamor and scold, launching vicious slander and persecution against Johnson. The London "Sunday Express" even shamelessly invoked the ninth commandment of the Ten Commandments of Moses, "Thou shalt not bear false witness," to slander the Archbishop's just action of faithfully fulfilling Christian doctrine. The British Parliament and Cabinet also issued rabid barks, threatening to have Queen Elizabeth remove Archbishop Johnson from his lifetime post, attempting to make Johnson cease his accusations against American germ warfare crimes.
    It is very clear that the British ruling group's slander and persecution of Johnson is acting on Washington's orders. But this is extremely detrimental to the British government. Because the British government is one of the signatories to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, it not only fails to condemn and stop the crimes of American aggressors conducting germ warfare, but also tries its best to conceal them. This is an intolerable insult to the Geneva Protocol that Britain participated in signing. From the fact that Johnson has been persecuted, people will more clearly recognize that the British government has completely lost its independent status, following the aggressive policies of the United States step by step, and willingly degenerating into Washington's running dog and accomplice.
    The British ruling group's panicked attack on Johnson will be completely futile. This behavior of the British government is only sufficient to show that Johnson's fair accusation of American germ warfare crimes has a significant impact on the British people. The British people are resolutely opposed to germ warfare; and Johnson is an upright Christian who holds sufficient evidence of American germ warfare, and therefore the British ruling group showed particular panic and unease, and did not hesitate to launch vicious personal attacks against him. What else can this explain? But the truth cannot be covered up. Johnson's just actions have the support of peace-loving people in Britain and all over the world, and the foolish behavior of the British ruling group can only meet with shameful failure.

### 坚决支持约翰逊的正义行动

    坚决支持约翰逊的正义行动
    英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊在我国进行七个星期参观访问之后，已经回到伦敦。约翰逊教长八日在伦敦招待记者会上发表谈话，十日发表了答复英国资产阶级报纸诬蔑的声明，他列举了许多无可辩驳的证据，揭露并控诉了美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的罪行。这一正义行动，有力地打击了美国侵略者的细菌战罪行，直接有助于保卫世界和平的事业。一切爱好和平的人民对于约翰逊仗义执言、保卫和平的战斗精神，都不能不表示敬意并予以坚决有力的支持。
    和费尔顿夫人去年揭露美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行之后所遭遇的情形一样，约翰逊教长谴责美国进行细菌战的谈话发表后，也受到英国统治集团的诽谤和迫害。作为美国侵略朝鲜帮凶的英国统治集团，过去对于美国的细菌战罪行，一直采取狡辩和掩饰的态度，并极力诬蔑朝中人民反细菌战的斗争，以欺骗英国广大爱好和平的人民。现在，当公正的英国人士握有美国细菌战的确实证据出来说话的时候，英国统治集团便表现了极度的惊恐不安，仓忙发动它所有的反动报纸叫嚣怒骂，向约翰逊进行恶毒的诽谤和迫害。伦敦“星期日快报”甚至无耻地援引摩西十诫中的第九诫，
    “不可作假见证”，来诬蔑教长忠实履行基督教教义的正义行动。英国议会和内阁也发出狺狺的狂吠，威胁着要伊丽莎白女王革除约翰逊教长的终身职务，企图使约翰逊停止对美国细菌战罪行的指责。
    很显然，英国统治集团对于约翰逊的诽谤和迫害，是奉华盛顿的命令行事的。但这对于英国政府是极为不利的。因为英国政府是一九二五年日内瓦议定书签字国之一，对于美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，不仅不予以谴责和制止，反而百般掩饰，这对于英国所参加签订的日内瓦议定书乃是不可容忍的污辱。从约翰逊遭受迫害的事实中，人们将更加清楚地认识到英国政府已经完全丧失了自己的独立地位，步步追随美国的侵略政策，自甘流为华盛顿的走狗和帮凶。
    英国统治集团慌乱地向约翰逊发动攻击，将是完全徒劳的。英国政府的这种行为，只足以说明约翰逊对于美国细菌战罪行的公正指责，在英国人民中具有重大的影响。英国人民是坚决反对细菌战的；而约翰逊则是一个正直的基督徒，他握有美国细菌战的充分罪证，因而英国统治集团才特别表现了惊慌不安，才不惜向他进行恶毒的人身攻击。除此以外，还能说明什么呢？但是真理是掩盖不住的。约翰逊的正义行动，有着英国和世界各国爱好和平人民的支持，英国统治集团的愚妄的行为只能遭到可耻的失败。
