Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 3rd: Korean public opinion and social figures have unanimously condemned the US aggressors' shameless provocative act of bombing the Yalu River power plants.

The "Labor News" editorial on June 29th stated: The large-scale bombing of our power plants, which are entirely peaceful facilities, by the US aggressive bandits is another clear demonstration of their conspiracy to expand the war. This beastly atrocity of US imperialism has brutally trampled on the strong desire of peace-loving people around the world to achieve an armistice in Korea, and has further aroused the enmity of the Korean people and the anger of all good people around the world. The editorial emphasized: US imperialism, which attempts to provoke a new war, can absolutely not weaken the strength of the people who are fighting for peace and progress. Peace-loving people all over the world will certainly be able to shatter the plans of the American murderers to instigate a new war. The editorial called on all Korean people to further increase their hatred and enmity towards the US aggressive bandits, and to continue to make unremitting struggles to support the front and consolidate the rear.

The "Democratic Korea" editorial on July 1st sternly condemned the US aggressors for destroying these non-military peaceful facilities in an attempt to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression. The editorial said that this provocative act of the US aggressors will absolutely not intimidate the Korean people, nor can it shake the Korean people's firm will to fight in the slightest. The Korean people have shattered the various provocative atrocities manufactured by the US aggressors behind the armistice negotiations in the past, and this time they will certainly respond to the enemy with heavy blows.

Responsible persons of various Korean democratic parties and people's organizations have issued statements expressing their anger at the shameless atrocities of the US aggressors in wantonly bombing Korean power plants. Jeong Seong-yeon, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Party, and Lee Young-gyun, Chairman of the Laboring People's Party, stated: The bombing of power facilities used by the Korean people to improve their living standards by the American beasts can absolutely not intimidate the Korean people, but can only expose its ugly face to the world once again, and can only further arouse the enmity and anger of the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world. The heroic Korean people, together with good people all over the world, are determined to stop the enemy's madness, shatter the enemy's conspiracy to expand the war, and resolutely hold the enemy accountable for its crimes.

Lee Tae-joon, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, said that the Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, firmly oppose and protest against this new atrocity of the US aggressors and their conspiracy to expand the war of aggression in Korea.

Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said: The US aggressors' widespread use of bacteriological weapons, the bloody massacre of our captured personnel, the continued shameless delay of the armistice negotiations, and the recent provocative act of bombing Korean power plants, clearly demonstrate the US aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war. However, their various atrocities and conspiracies are doomed to failure. Kim Young-soo called on the Korean people to be vigilant at all times, to be fully prepared, and to expose and shatter any provocative acts of the US aggressors in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: Karachi News: Professor Hai, Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, recently issued a declaration on behalf of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, condemning the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare, massacring prisoners of war, and deliberately undermining the Korean armistice negotiations.

The declaration pointed out: The large-scale massacre and brutal destruction of the Korean people by US imperialism has entered its third year, and its crimes are rarely seen in the bloody history of imperialists. American interventionists are carrying out barbaric massacres in Korea, raping women, burying Korean patriots alive, and bombing peaceful residents. After the failure of all these shameless adventures, the American interventionists have violated all civilized regulations, waged bacteriological warfare, and massacred Korean prisoners on Geoje Island.

The declaration continued: Because the tycoons of Wall Street are unwilling to give up war profits, they are constantly coming up with various excuses to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations. The key issue in the current armistice negotiations is the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. The US authorities are forcing prisoners of war to refuse repatriation. All the people of the world, except for the American war profiteers, are eager for peace, and we demand that the issue of prisoners of war be resolved on the basis of complete repatriation.

The declaration finally called on the United Nations, especially the Pakistani government, to re-recognize the situation in the Far East and to quickly achieve a lasting peace in Korea in order to save the world from imminent disaster.

    朝鲜人民痛斥美国轰炸朝鲜发电厂暴行
    全巴基斯坦和平委员会发表宣言谴责美国破坏停战谈判
    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜舆论界和社会人士一致痛斥美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的无耻挑衅行为。
    “劳动新闻”六月二十九日的社论说：美国侵略强盗对我们这些完全是和平设施的发电厂的大举轰炸，是它们阴谋扩大战争的又一明证。美帝国主义这种野兽暴行，横暴地蹂躏了全世界爱好和平人民对于实现朝鲜停战的强烈愿望，已进一步激起了朝鲜人民的敌忾和全世界善良人民的愤怒。社论强调指出：企图挑起新战争的美帝国主义绝对不能削弱为和平与进步而斗争的人民的力量。全世界爱好和平的人民必能粉碎美国杀人犯挑拨新战争的计划。社论号召全朝鲜人民进一步提高对美国侵略强盗的仇恨与敌忾，为支援前线与巩固后方，继续作不懈的斗争。
    “民主朝鲜”七月一日的社论严正斥责美国侵略者破坏这些非军事性的和平设施，企图以此破坏停战谈判、扩大侵略战争的阴谋。社论说，美国侵略者的这种挑衅行为绝对吓不倒朝鲜人民，不能丝毫动摇朝鲜人民坚决的斗争意志。朝鲜人民过去已经粉碎了美国侵略者在停战谈判背后所制造的种种挑衅暴行，这一次也一定要用沉重的打击来回答敌人。
    朝鲜各民主政党人民团体的负责人纷纷发表谈话，对于美国侵略者滥炸朝鲜发电厂的无耻暴行，表示愤怒。朝鲜民主党副委员长郑圣彦和勤劳人民党委员长李英均表示：美国野兽对于朝鲜人民用以增进生活福利的发电设施的轰炸，绝对不能吓倒朝鲜人民，只能向全世界再一次暴露它的丑恶面目，只能进一步激起朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的敌忾和愤怒。英雄的朝鲜人民和全世界善良人民一起决心制止敌人的疯狂行为，粉碎敌人扩大战争的阴谋，并要坚决追究敌人的罪责。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长李泰俊说，朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起坚决反对和抗议美国侵略者这种新的暴行和它们扩大侵朝战争的阴谋。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长金英秀说：美国侵略者广泛使用细菌武器、对我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀、继续无耻地拖延停战谈判以及最近轰炸朝鲜各发电厂的挑衅行为，清楚地表明美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋。但是，它们的种种暴行和阴谋诡计是注定要失败的。金英秀号召朝鲜人民随时提高警惕，作好一切准备，及时揭穿并粉碎美国侵略者的任何挑衅行为。
    【新华社三日讯】喀喇蚩消息：全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长哈伊教授顷代表全巴基斯坦和平委员会发表宣言，谴责美国进行细菌战、残杀战俘和蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
    宣言指出：美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的大规模屠杀及残酷破坏已进入第三年，其罪行之巨大为帝国主义者的血腥历史中所罕见。美国干涉者在朝鲜进行野蛮的屠杀、强奸妇女、活埋朝鲜爱国志士、轰炸和平居民。在这一切无耻的冒险失败之后，美国干涉者竟破坏一切文明法规，进行细菌战争，并在巨济岛屠杀朝俘。
    宣言继称；由于华尔街的大亨们不甘心放弃战争利润，他们正在不断地想出各种藉口破坏朝鲜停战谈判。目前停战谈判中的关键问题是遣俘问题，美国当局正强迫战俘拒绝遣返。全世界人民除美国战争贩子外，都渴望和平，我们要求战俘问题应在全部遣返的基础上解决。
    宣言最后要求联合国特别是巴基斯坦政府，重新认识远东形势，并迅速获致朝鲜的持久和平，以拯救全世界免受迫在眉睫的灾难。
