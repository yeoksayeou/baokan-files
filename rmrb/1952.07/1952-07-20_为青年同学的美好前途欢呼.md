Cheering for the Bright Future of Young Students
Zhang Haifu, Fourth-Year Student, Department of Hydraulic Engineering, Jiaotong University

Hearing the news of the government's adjustment of the people's scholarships for students in national universities and secondary schools, I have many things in my heart to pour out to our beloved Chairman Mao, and to all the young students across the country.

Thinking back to before liberation, not only were the vast numbers of worker and peasant youth shut out of the school gates, but even those youth who were fortunate enough to study in middle school were constantly worried about entering higher education, feeling that entering university was like passing through the "gates of hell." Take Shanghai for example, at that time tens of thousands of people took the university entrance exams every year, but only a small fraction were admitted. Every summer, everyone rushed around in the scorching heat to take the university entrance exams, and many people couldn't even find a place to stay, sleeping in the corridors of various universities and being bitten by mosquitoes. Many people failed the exams year after year, living a painful life of being out of school and unemployed. Now, batches of worker and peasant youth are entering schools. And this year, the number of high school graduates is not even enough to fill the government's planned university enrollment quota!

The life in universities before liberation was infuriating. How many dear classmates were admitted to school, but couldn't afford the tuition and board fees and couldn't enter. Students in school also encountered all kinds of suffering. Just to talk about some aspects of life: I will never forget those days in school not long before Shanghai's liberation. At that time, the bandit Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Shanghai, and our food became even worse. Every day, before mealtime, there was a long line of hungry people at the entrance of the dining hall, but what they got was "eight-treasure rice" (this historical term needs an explanation to make today's students understand: at that time, because the school's food was very bad, the moldy rice was mixed with chaff, sand, mud, rat droppings, and even wood chips and glass shards, so the students called it "eight-treasure rice"). Even such rice was often snatched up in ten minutes, and those who were late were so angry that they threw their bowls. As for the vegetables, there's no need to mention them: plain boiled water with old vegetable leaves. Many students developed stomach problems, many students dozed off in class, few went to the sports field, and some were so weak that they panted even when going upstairs. Many students had to squeeze out time to work as tutors, draw pictures, copy, and mimeograph outside the school to earn some money to pay for meals!

However, the reactionaries had even more sinister plots to harm students. They hoped to prevent young people from participating in progressive political activities by increasing the burden of students' studies. Forcing you to memorize the terms in American textbooks, taking big exams and small exams constantly. Many students were so tired that they developed lung disease and coughed up blood, but the reactionaries were very happy. At that time, Jiaotong University had these sentences circulating: "First year buy candles (stay up late to catch up on homework), second year buy glasses (become nearsighted), third year buy spittoons (get lung disease), fourth year buy coffins." What a painful description! What happened to those who were lucky enough to graduate? "Graduation means unemployment!"

Since liberation, with the progress of the motherland, schools across the country have also changed. The school system and curriculum are being reformed step by step; the living standards of students are also improving semester by semester. In the past, Jiaotong University was famous for producing lung diseases, but in less than a year after liberation, the school concentrated the students who had previously developed lung disease and gave them recuperation and comfort. Many people quickly regained their health and were reborn. Now our food includes meat dishes at every meal and soy milk every day. In this patriotic health campaign, we eliminated the annoying mosquitoes, and the stinking ditch that has surrounded the school for decades will also be filled. We are building a beautiful learning environment. Every morning, students in Democracy Square do morning exercises in the morning light; in the evening, people are playing ball, high jumping, and running everywhere, a group of people are dancing group dances here, and a group of people are singing about Chairman Mao there. The radiance of happiness shines on the campus, and every student is full of new vitality.

Now, the government has announced further measures to improve the lives of students, and I cheer for the increasingly bright future of our young students across the country, and cheer for the glorious and brilliant future of the motherland!

### 为青年同学的美好前途欢呼

    为青年同学的美好前途欢呼
    交通大学水利系四年级学生  张海富
    听到政府调整全国高等学校和中等学校学生人民助学金的消息，我心里有许多话要向敬爱的毛主席倾吐，要向全国的青年同学们倾吐。
    回想解放以前，不仅广大工、农青年被关在学校的大门外，即使侥幸能够在中学读书的青年，也时时刻刻为升学发愁，觉得进大学好像闯“鬼门关”。拿上海说吧，那时每年有几万人考大学，被录取的只有一小部分。一到夏天，大家在炎天暑地东奔西走考大学，许多人连住的地方也找不到，露宿在各大学的走廊上挨蚊子咬。许多人考来考去还是考不上，一年一年地过着失学失业的痛苦生活。现在，一批一批的工农青年进学校了。而今年高中毕业的同学，全部进大学还不够政府预定的大学招生名额哩！
    解放前大学里的生活，提起来就令人愤怒。多少亲爱的同学考上了学校，却因交不起学膳费而无法进门。在校的学生，也遭遇着种种痛苦。就拿一些生活方面的事来说吧：我始终忘不掉上海解放前不久我在学校的那些日子。那时，匪徒蒋经国到了上海，我们的伙食变得更坏了。每天还不到吃饭的时间，膳厅门口就排着长长的饥饿队伍，但吃到的却是“八宝饭”（这个历史名词要加解说才能使现在的同学们明白：当时因为学校的伙食很坏，发霉的米里面混合着糠秕、砂子、泥、老鼠屎甚至碎木片和玻璃屑等等，所以同学们称它做“八宝饭”）。就是这样的饭也常常是在十分钟里一抢而光，来迟了的人气得摔碗。菜呢，更不用说：白开水加老菜叶。好多同学生了胃病，好多同学在上课时打瞌睡，到运动场去的寥寥无几，有的人虚弱到上上楼梯也喘气。许多同学为了要维持这点伙食，还得挤出时间到校外去当家庭教师、给人家绘图、抄写、刻腊板，赚几个钱来交膳费！
    可是，反动派还有更厉害的残害学生的阴谋。他们希望用加重学生功课负担的办法来阻止青年参加进步的政治活动。强迫你死背美国课本上的名词，大考、小考考个不停。许多同学累得生肺病、吐血，反动派却十分开心。当时，交通大学流传着这样几句话：“一年级买蜡烛（开夜车赶功课），二年级买眼镜（变成近视了），三年级买痰盂（得肺病了），四年级买棺材。”这是多么痛心的描写啊！侥幸毕了业的又怎样呢？“毕业即失业！”
    解放以来，随着祖国的进步，全国的学校也变了样。学制课程在一步步地改革；同学的生活水平也一学期比一学期提高。从前交通大学以制造肺病著名，但解放不到一年，学校已把从前生肺病的同学集中起来，给以疗养和安慰。许多人很快恢复了健康，得到了新生。现在我们的伙食，餐餐有荤菜，天天喝豆浆。在这次爱国卫生运动中，我们消灭了扰人的蚊虫，几十年来围绕校舍四周的臭水沟，也要把它填平。我们正在建设一个优美的学习环境。每天早上，民主广场上的同学们在晨光里做早操；傍晚，到处有人在打球、跳高、跑步，这儿一群人在跳集体舞，那儿一群人在歌唱毛主席。幸福的光辉照耀着校园，每个同学都充满了新生的活力。
    现在，政府又公布了进一步改善学生生活的办法，我为我们全国青年学生日益美好的将来而欢呼，为祖国光辉灿烂的前途而欢呼！
