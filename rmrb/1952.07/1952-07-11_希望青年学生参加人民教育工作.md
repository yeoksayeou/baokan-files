Hoping Young Students Participate in People's Education Work
Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China, Wu Yuzhang

This summer, a large number of young students will graduate from secondary schools and universities, continuing their studies or taking up work positions. I would like to say a few important words to these graduating students.

Young people living in the era of Mao Zedong are fortunate. The country gives them great care and expectations, enabling them to have a promising future on the road to learning and serving the people. As the nationwide upsurge of large-scale economic construction is about to arrive, the country has issued a resounding call to all students, hoping that without exception, they will all become cadres capable of undertaking the task of building a new society, including cadres in the important department of education. People's teachers are the cadres who cultivate cadres, and the motherland needs to increase the number of teachers at all levels by more than one million in the next three to five years. The number of our current reserve force of teachers is far from meeting this need. Therefore, this year's college enrollment focuses on normal colleges, and the work assignment of college graduates also focuses on education work. As an education worker, I hope that a large number of middle school graduates will enter normal schools, and that a large number of university graduates in literature, history, and other subjects will participate in people's education work.

In old China, education was permeated with the spirit of serving the interests of the reactionary ruling class. It was used by the reactionary rulers as a tool to deceive and numb the people, and at the same time, it was regarded by people as a way to make a living or a business of selling knowledge. Education work was a profession despised by people and teachers themselves. However, that era is long gone. Everyone has seen that in our people's new China, education is "a tremendous positive force" in helping the construction of the new society and eliminating the foundation of the old society. For the sake of construction, and also precisely in the midst of construction, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of various cadres and talents, and to improve the people's cultural level and popularize education on an unprecedented and continuous scale. This is precisely the task of teachers and other education workers. Teachers undertake this glorious task. As propagandists of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and disseminators of advanced cultural and scientific knowledge, as "engineers of the human soul," they have been included in the ranks of the great and glorious working class, and their material treatment has been gradually improved and will continue to be improved.

Education work is a kind of creative and constructive work that requires relatively long-term cultivation. The responsibility borne by a teacher is very heavy, and what he should learn is very rich. In order to educate others, the teacher himself should first be a person with both ability and moral integrity, that is to say, he himself should first learn very well in all aspects, not only have specialized professional and educational scientific knowledge, but also temper his own ideological character and improve his political consciousness. Many advanced young people, because they have the spirit of serving the people, love education, are tireless in learning and teaching, and have created outstanding achievements with their own labor, have become excellent people's teachers. Everyone can see from the current social life that the more teachers who do not fail the people's expectations in the education work position, the more they are loved and praised by the government and the people. For example, Qi Jianhua, the cultural instructor of the People's Liberation Army and the creator of the "quick literacy method," Lv Jingxian, the special outstanding teacher of Harbin Youth, and Shi Ruifen, the model rural female teacher of Southern Jiangsu, and other young comrades, their fame has spread among the broad masses of the people, and they have become model figures who are universally respected. I have met them successively at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and at the award ceremony of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council. When I saw their admirable spirit and deeds, I could not but regard these young comrades as the pride of education workers. I deeply feel that they are a kind of example for young students, and that more excellent people's teachers will emerge from among young students in a steady stream.

Our contingent of education workers is a part of the great working class and people's ranks fighting for the construction of the motherland. I sincerely welcome the young comrades who will enter normal schools and take up education work positions this summer. They will become fresh blood in our contingent of education workers.

    希望青年学生参加人民教育工作
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席  吴玉章
    今年暑假，将有大批的青年学生从各中等学校和高等学校里毕业出来，继续升学或是走上工作岗位。我想对这些毕业同学们说几句紧要的话。
    生活在毛泽东时代的青年是幸福的。国家对他们给予极大的关怀和期望，使他们在学习和为人民服务的道路上有着远大的前程。当着全国大规模的经济建设高潮即将到来的时候，国家向所有的学生发出了响亮的号召，希望他们没有例外地全部成为能够担负起建设新社会的任务的干部，其中包括着教育工作这一个重要部门的干部。人民教师，乃是培养干部的干部，祖国在今后三五年内，需要增加各级师资一百多万人。我们今天所有的师资后备军的数量却远远赶不上这个需要。因此，今年高等学校招生以师范学院为重点之一，高等学校毕业生工作分配亦以教育工作为重点之一。作为一个教育工作者，我希望有大批中学毕业生升入师范学校，希望有大批大学文、史等科的毕业生参加人民教育工作。
    在旧中国，教育浸透着为反动统治阶级的利益服务的精神，它被反动统治者用作欺骗与麻醉人民的工具，同时又被人们当作谋生之道或贩卖知识的商业。教育工作是被人们和教师自己所轻视的职业。但是，这种时代早已一去不返了。大家已经看见，在我们人民的新中国，教育是帮助新社会建设和消灭旧社会基础的“一种极大的积极力量”。为了建设事业，同时也正是在建设事业中间，需要培养大量的各种干部和人材，需要空前地、不断地提高人民的文化水平和普及教育。这正是教师以及其他教育工作者的任务。教师担负着这个光荣任务。作为马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的宣传者和先进文化科学知识的传播者，作为“人类灵魂的工程师”，他们已经列入伟大光荣的工人阶级的队伍，他们的物质待遇已经逐步并将继续得到改善。
    教育工作是一种需要有比较长期修养的、有创造性和建设性的工作。一个教师所担负的责任是十分重大的，他所应学习的东西也是十分丰富的。为了教育别人，教师自己首先应该是才德兼备的人，这就是说，他自己首先应该在各方面学习得很好，不但要有专门业务和教育科学的知识，而且要锻炼自己的思想品质，提高政治觉悟。有许多先进的青年们，由于他们有为人民服务的精神，热爱教育事业，学而不厌，诲人不倦，用自己的劳动创造了卓越的成绩，他们都成了优秀的人民教师。大家可以从现在社会生活中看到：越是这样在教育工作岗位上不负人民厚望的教师们，就越是受到政府和人民的爱戴与表扬。例如人民解放军的文化教员、“速成识字法”创造者祁建华、哈尔滨青年特等优秀教师吕敬先、苏南模范乡村女教师史瑞芬等青年同志，他们的盛名已经在广大人民中间流传，他们已经成为受到普遍敬爱的模范人物。我曾经在政协全国委员会会议上和政务院文教委员会授奖大会上先后会见过他们。我看到他们可佩的精神和事迹时，不能不把这些青年同志引为教育工作者的骄傲。我深深感到：他们是青年学生们的一种榜样，而从青年学生中间将有更多的优秀的人民教师源源涌现出来。
    我们教育工作者的队伍是为建设祖国而斗争的伟大的工人阶级和人民阵容的一部分。我衷心地欢迎今年暑假将升入师范学校和走上教育工作岗位的青年同志们，他们将成为我们教育工作者队伍中的新鲜血液。
