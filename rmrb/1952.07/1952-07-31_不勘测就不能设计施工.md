    No Design or Construction Without Surveying
    Editor: The Basic Construction Bureau of the Qiqihar Railway Administration does not test the foundation, but blindly designs, resulting in rework and waste. On May 6th of this year, the Qiqihar Railway Administration began to build the technical school's school building, but by June 31st, the Basic Construction Bureau had not yet surveyed the entire project properly. Instead, they sent a design drawing that had not been reviewed and approved to the site for construction. After the construction unit excavated the foundation according to the design drawing, they found that the soil quality was poor. The design department then temporarily changed the design, deciding to drive 414 wooden piles. After driving the wooden piles, steel rails should have been laid according to the design drawing. The workers laid 280 steel rails, but then received an order saying, "Do not lay steel rails." They had to lift the laid steel rails from the two-meter-deep foundation, wasting more than 100 workdays. After the workers excavated the foundation of the technical school's canteen, filled it with gravel, and tamped it, the Basic Construction Bureau suddenly instructed, "The originally designed width is not enough, it needs to be widened by 0.4 meters." As a result, more than 200 workdays were wasted again. Such repeated changes in design have wasted manpower and materials and delayed the progress of the project. I hope that the basic construction departments will learn from this lesson and not blindly design and construct before conducting a serious survey.

### 不勘测就不能设计施工

    不勘测就不能设计施工
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔铁路管理局基本建设处不测验地基，盲目设计，因而发生返工的浪费现象。今年五月六日，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局开始修建技术学校校舍，但在六月三十一日基本建设处还没有把整个工程勘测好，却把一个未经审查和批准的设计图送到现场，进行施工。施工单位按照设计图挖完地基，发现土质不良，设计科又临时变更设计，决定打木桩四百十四根。打完木桩以后，按照设计图应该铺钢轨，工人们把二百八十根钢轨铺好了，又接到命令说：“不铺钢轨”，只好把铺好的钢轨从两米多深的地基里抬出来，浪费了一百多工。工人们挖完技术学校的食堂地基，填上石子，打完了夯，但是基本建设处又忽然指示说：“原设计的宽度不够，要加宽零点四米。”结果又浪费了二百多工。这样地反复变更设计，浪费了人力和资材，延迟了工程的进度。我希望基本建设部门接受这个教训，在没有认真地勘测之前，就不要盲目地设计、施工。
