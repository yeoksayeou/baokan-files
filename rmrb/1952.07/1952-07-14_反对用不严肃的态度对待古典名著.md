    Opposing Treating Classical Masterpieces with a Frivolous Attitude
    Editor: "Romance of the West Chamber" is a famous Chinese classical literary masterpiece. It profoundly depicts the story of a young couple in a feudal society more than a thousand years ago who fought for freedom of marriage, forcing Madam Cui, whose feudal ideology was extremely strong, to bow before them. However, the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" performed by the "Guangming Troupe" of the Shanghai Zhonghua Grand Theater did not express the anti-feudal spirit of the play. The playwright forcibly added a maid, Lvyun, to Madam Cui, portraying her as vile and shameless, constantly monitoring Yingying, and engaging in sabotage or obstruction, making the audience think that Madam Cui's feudal stubbornness was entirely caused by her alone. This diluted the audience's aversion to Madam Cui, a representative of feudal forces.

    The playwright also committed the error of anti-historicism. Originally, it would have been enough to explain that General Bai Ma led his troops to defeat Sun Feihu and lift the siege, but in the play, after Sun Feihu was captured, there was a scene of handing him over to the masses for disposal. This could not have happened at that time.

    There are also some vulgar and low-level sentiments in the play. For example, when Zhang Sheng first saw Cui Yingying at the door, his behavior was frivolous. There are also many vulgar phrases in his lyrics.

    In order to cherish our country's classical literary masterpieces, we resolutely oppose all irresponsible and rough attitudes towards classical literature.

    反对用不严肃的态度对待古典名著
    编辑同志：“西厢记”是中国古典文学名著，它深刻地描写了在一千多年前的封建社会里，一对青年男女为了争取婚姻自由，迫使封建思想极浓厚的崔相国夫人在他们面前低头的故事。但是，上海中华大戏院“光明剧团”演出的越剧“西厢记”，并没有把剧中的反封建精神表现出来。编剧者在剧中硬添了一个崔夫人的婢女绿云，把她写得卑鄙无耻，时刻监视着莺莺，从事破坏或阻挠，使得观众认为崔夫人的封建顽固，完全是由她一人所造成的，因此冲淡了观众对作为封建势力的一个代表的崔夫人的恶感。
    编剧者还犯了反历史主义的错误。本来只要说明白马将军领兵前来击溃孙飞虎、解除围困就够了，可是剧中孙飞虎被擒后，又来了一个交给群众发落的场面。而在当时，这是不可能发生的。
    剧中还存在着一些庸俗的、低级的情调。如张生在门口初见崔莺莺时，就是举止轻薄的。在他的唱词中，也存在着许多庸俗的语句。
    为了珍惜我国古典文学名著，我们坚决反对一切对古典文学的不负责任的粗暴态度。
