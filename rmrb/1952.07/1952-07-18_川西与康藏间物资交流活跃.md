Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 16th: Material exchange between western Sichuan and the Kham and Tibet regions is becoming increasingly active.

The trade between western Sichuan and Kham-Tibet mainly involves transporting tea, tobacco, silk, and general merchandise from western Sichuan to the minority areas of Kham-Tibet, in exchange for medicinal materials, furs, and other goods. This year, the sales volume of these goods has far exceeded that of last year. The tea companies of Mingshan, Hongya, and Pujiang counties in western Sichuan alone have signed contracts with Xikang to transport and sell 700,000 jin of tea, which began to be shipped to the Kham-Tibet region in July. The tobacco produced in Guanxian, western Sichuan, specifically for the minority people of Kham-Tibet, will reach 500,000 jin this year, an increase of about 50 times compared to last year. From January to May this year, over 12,900 chi of silk and silk embroidery were transported from Chengdu to Xikang and Tibet.

Now, law and order on the roads of Kham-Tibet has become increasingly consolidated. The construction of highways has been increased in various areas of Kham-Tibet. Therefore, freight rates have been greatly reduced, and private merchants are becoming increasingly active. This year, the amount of medicinal materials and furs transported from the Kham-Tibet area to western Sichuan has more than doubled compared to last year. The vast majority of these goods are handled by Han and various minority private merchants.

    川西与康藏间物资交流活跃
    【新华社成都十六日电】川西地区和西康、西藏间的物资交流日形活跃。
    川西和康、藏间的贸易主要是川西的茶叶、烟草、绸缎、百货运销康藏少数民族地区，换回药材、皮毛等货。今年这些东西运销量都远超过去年。仅川西名山、洪雅、蒲江三县茶叶公司即和西康订立了运销七十万斤茶叶的合同，此项茶叶已自七月份起开始运往康藏地区。川西灌县一带所产专供康藏少数民族用的烟草，今年将运五十万斤到康藏地区；这比去年增加五十倍左右。川西绸缎和丝织绣品，今年一月到五月由成都运到西康、西藏的达一万二千九百多尺。
    现在康藏道路上治安秩序已日趋巩固；康藏各区增修了公路，因此，运费已大大降低，私商也日渐活跃。今年由康藏地区运到川西的药材、皮毛，已超过去年一倍多。这些东西极大部分是由汉族和各少数民族私商经营的。
