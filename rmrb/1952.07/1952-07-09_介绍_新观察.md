Introducing "New Observer"
Jiang Hong

"New Observer" has been published for two years. This comprehensive bi-monthly magazine covering current affairs, political events, news reports, culture and the arts, has attracted the attention of readers with its fresh look since its inception on July 1, 1950. Over the past two years, it has gradually established its path forward. With its lively, fresh style, and rich illustrations, it extensively reflects new things and new atmospheres in all aspects of the new Chinese social life. Many people read this magazine with great interest, gaining rich knowledge from it.

"New Observer" is a beneficial reading material, providing materials that can be used in various ways. For example, teachers can use it as an assistant for teaching history, geography, current events, and language.

The old geography textbooks of the past told us about a static world, filled with one-sided and even distorted descriptions. It was impossible to understand how things arise and develop from there. Since liberation, geography textbooks have been significantly improved, but ultimately still cannot keep up with this rapidly changing world.

One geography teacher already understands this point. He advocates teaching geography from a developmental perspective. However, when talking about how to make teaching lively, he exemplifies by saying that the ancient poem "The sky is vast, the fields are boundless, the wind blows the grass low and reveals the cattle and sheep" can be used to describe Inner Mongolia. Is the so-called "frontier scenery" really like this? An author, after a long journey of over 10,000 miles in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, reported to us in "New Observer": "In northern China, I saw fertile and vast grasslands, the inexhaustible Ujimqin natural salt lake, the Greater Khingan Mountains primitive forest known as the 'sea of trees', Dalai Lake called the 'treasure basin', the Zhalainuoer coal mine with rich reserves, the gold-producing area along the Ergun River, herds of cattle, horses, and sheep all over the mountains and plains, the endless black soil fertile fields, the emerging cities with towering chimneys along the railway lines, countless precious native products, endless underground treasures, the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of people… All of this makes me deeply feel that Inner Mongolia is a rich and beautiful place." This is much richer than using an ancient poem to illustrate the situation in Inner Mongolia.

Similarly, another "New Observer" correspondence from Xikang vividly describes the scenery of the Tibetan Plateau: "The Kangzang Plateau is not all desolate thousands of mountain ranges, here there are plains stretching hundreds of miles everywhere." In spring, the fields of the plateau "display patches of green tender seedlings, the snow on the mountain tops gleams brilliantly in the sun, the Kangzang Plateau in April is so attractive, we can be proud, the border of the motherland is such a lovely land!"

People seem to know more about the Subei Plain. However, the correspondence "The Largest Irrigation Project in New China" points out to us that after the completion of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal project, the natural landscape of Subei will be completely changed.

We also need to mention the foreign correspondence frequently published in "New Observer." A Bulgarian correspondence entitled "Dimitrovgrad" introduces this industrial city that is not found on old maps. The author tells us: "The face of Bulgaria – whether in the south or north, in cities and villages, in grasslands and mountains – is changing every day and every hour."

We must thoroughly get rid of old ideas in order to recognize the true face of the motherland and the world. Geography teaching should adopt new methods to make people aware of the developing and changing world. In order to achieve this goal, I believe that "New Observer" can indeed be used as a powerful assistant, because here there are wonderful correspondences from all over the country, bringing new and vivid materials to geography teaching, and it is very convenient to implement political ideology or patriotism education. In some news reports, because the author can connect with historical situations when introducing a certain region or a certain thing, it also contains some information about modern history to a greater or lesser extent.

The writing of some news reports published in "New Observer" is also excellent. Each issue also has a few essays and "small life stories," many of which are also well-written and can analyze an ideological problem with concise language, or vividly portray new people and new things in every corner of new China. Teachers can find suitable extracurricular reading materials or supplementary teaching materials from here for students, and use them to enlighten students on how to select various themes existing in the surrounding life to write short essays and even sketches, correspondences, and reports, and overcome the way of fabricating out of thin air in the classroom.

Publicity workers among the masses can also use the materials of this publication. "New Observer's" Korean correspondence, production and construction reports, city introductions, rural correspondence, border correspondence, and certain papers, often provide specific materials on current affairs and politics, mass movements, and national construction, or more systematic discussions. They will help publicity workers enrich the content of publicity and make publicity more vivid and powerful.

In order to give full play to the role of this publication, we hope that "New Observer" will continue to improve and enrich its content. The great motherland is advancing rapidly. How to both extensively reflect new social life and make more planned and focused reports on mass movements and production construction, I think it still depends on the "New Observer" editors to continue to study and improve. The editorial department of "New Observer" should more widely contact the masses, strive for the cooperation of readers, and often listen to readers' feedback, so that not only can it better meet the needs of readers in terms of content, but also in terms of form and style, it can gradually become more perfect on the existing basis. Such a comprehensive publication, being good at mastering its own style, I think is a very important thing.

### 介绍“新观察”

    介绍“新观察”
    江  虹
    “新观察”创刊两周年了。这个时事政治、通讯报道、文化艺术的综合性半月刊，在一九五○年七月一日创刊后，即以其新鲜的面貌受到读者注意，两年来它逐渐确定了前进的道路，它以活泼清新、图文并茂的风格，广泛地反映了新中国社会生活的各个方面的新事物、新气象。许多人以浓厚的兴趣来阅读这个杂志，从这里面获得丰富的知识。
    “新观察”是一种有益的读物，它供给可以从各个方面来加以利用的材料。例如，教师们便可以把它当作进行史地、时事和语文教学的助手。
    过去的陈旧的地理教科书，告诉我们的是一个静止的世界，并且充斥着片面的甚至歪曲的描述。从那里不可能了解事物是怎样产生和发展的。解放后，地理课本已经有了重大的改进，但是终究还赶不上这日新月异的世界。
    有一位地理教学工作者已经懂得这一点，他主张用发展的观点来教地理。然而在讲到如何使教课生动时，他却又举例说，可以用“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”这一古代诗歌来形容内蒙古。所谓“塞外风光”真是这样的吗？一位作者在内蒙古自治区作了一次万余里的长途旅行后，在“新观察”上向我们报道：“在祖国北方，我看到了肥美而辽阔的大草原，取之不尽的乌珠穆沁天然盐池，有树海之誉的大兴安岭原始森林，被称为‘聚宝盆’的达赉鱼湖，蕴藏丰富的扎赉诺尔煤矿，额尔古纳沿岸的产金区，满山遍野的牛马羊群，一望无际的黑土沃野，铁路线上的烟囱林立的新兴城市，无数的珍贵土产，无尽的地下宝藏，广大人民爱国主义的热情劳动……所有这一切，使我深深地感到内蒙古是一个富饶而美丽的地方。”这就比之用一句古代诗歌来说明内蒙古情况要丰富得多了。
    同样，“新观察”的另一篇西康通讯，把康藏高原的风物作了生动的描写：“康藏高原并不全是荒凉的千障山峦，这里随处有着纵横百里的平川。”春天，高原的田野间“铺展了片片青绿嫩苗，山头积雪皎洁地在阳光下闪烁，四月的康藏高原是多么诱人，我们可以自豪，祖国的边疆是多么可爱的土地！”
    苏北平原，人们似乎比较了解。然而，“新中国最大的灌溉工程”这篇通讯向我们指明，在苏北灌溉总渠工程完成后，苏北的自然面貌将会完全改观。
    我们还需要提到“新观察”经常刊载的国外通讯。一篇题为“季米特洛夫城”的保加利亚通讯，介绍了这个为旧的地图上所没有的工业城市。作者告诉我们：“保加利亚的面貌——不论在南方和北方，在城市和乡村，在草原和山岭——每日每时都在改变着。”
    我们必须彻底摆脱旧的观念，才能认识祖国和世界的真实面貌。地理教学应当采取新的方法，使人们认识在发展和变化着的世界。为了达到这个目的，我认为确实可以把“新观察”作为有力的助手，因为在这里有来自全国各地的精彩的通讯，带给了地理教学以新的生动的材料，并且十分便利于贯彻政治思想或爱国主义教育。而在若干通讯报道里，由于作者在介绍某一地区或某一事物时，能够联系历史情况，也就或多或少地包含了现代史方面的一些资料。
    “新观察”中刊载的有些通讯报道，其文字也是优美的。它每一期还都有几篇小品和“生活小故事”，其中也有不少是写得好的，能够以精练的文字，分析一个思想问题，或生动地刻画新中国各个角落的新人新事。教师们可以从这里给学生找到适当的课外读物或补充教材，利用它们来启发学生如何选取存在于周围生活中的各种题材写作短文以至速写、通讯、报告，而克服那种在教室里面壁虚构的方式。
    在群众中的宣传员，同样可以利用这个刊物的材料。“新观察”的朝鲜通讯、生产建设报道、城市介绍、农村通讯、边疆通讯，以及某些论文，经常提供关于时事政治、群众运动、国家建设的具体材料，或较系统的论述。它们将帮助宣传员充实宣传内容，使宣传更加生动有力。
    为了充分发挥这个刊物的作用，我们希望“新观察”继续不断地改进和充实它的内容。伟大的祖国在飞速前进，如何既能广泛地反映新的社会生活，又能对群众运动、生产建设作更有计划和有重点的报道，我想仍是有赖“新观察”编者继续研究改进的。“新观察”的编辑部应该更广泛地联系群众，争取读者的合作，并经常听取读者的反映，以便不仅在内容方面更好地满足读者的需要，而且在形式和风格方面，也能在现有基础上逐步地更趋完美。这样一个综合性的刊物，善于掌握自己的风格，我想确是一件十分重要的事。
