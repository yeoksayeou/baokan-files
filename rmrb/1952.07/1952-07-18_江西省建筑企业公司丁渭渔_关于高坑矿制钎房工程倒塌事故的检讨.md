    Ding Weiyu, Jiangxi Provincial Construction Enterprise Company
    Self-criticism Regarding the Collapse Accident of the Shank Forging Workshop Project at Gaokeng Mine

    Editor: The criticisms from Comrades Xie Yucheng and Wang Chongding published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 18th, regarding my lack of responsibility in my work, are very correct. My self-criticism is as follows: The collapse incident that occurred in the shank forging workshop project at Gaokeng Mine of Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi, which our company contracted, is inseparable from my lack of responsibility in my work. Because I did not grasp the cross-sectional drawings of the earthwork and the construction procedures beforehand, did not study the construction methods, and did not pay attention to engineering data; and during the progress of the project, I did not conduct in-depth inspections, resulting in a cave-in accident halfway through. If I had closely contacted the masses beforehand and made all the preparations for construction, many mistakes could have been completely avoided. The careless style in technical work further illustrates that my sense of responsibility to serve the people is weak. My understanding of relying on workers to do a good job in basic construction is vague, so I am not actively absorbing workers' opinions to improve my work. I have already made a self-criticism of the above errors in the "Three-Anti" campaign and realized that these are all bourgeois ideas. In the future, I am determined to work hard to transform myself and strengthen my sense of responsibility to serve the people.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    江西省建筑企业公司丁渭渔
    关于高坑矿制钎房工程倒塌事故的检讨
    编辑同志：二月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了谢宇澄、王崇鼎二同志批评我工作不负责任，这是很对的。现检讨如下：我们公司承包的江西萍乡煤矿高坑矿制钎房工程发生倒塌事件，和我工作上的不负责任是分不开的。由于我事前不掌握土方断面图施工程序，不研究施工方法，不重视工程资料；在工程进行中，又不作深入检查，致中途发生坍方事故。如果我事前密切联系群众，作好一切施工准备工作，许多错误是完全可以避免的。技术工作中的粗枝大叶作风，进一步说明了我为人民服务的责任心是薄弱的。我对依靠工人做好基本建设的认识是模糊的，所以，就不积极吸取工人意见以改进工作。以上错误，我在“三反”中，已作了检查，认识了这都是资产阶级的思想。今后我决心在工作中努力改造自己，加强为人民服务的责任心。
