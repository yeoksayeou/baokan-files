Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, dispatch from Chicago by TASS: The Democratic National Convention plenary session approved its campaign platform on July 23rd.

On foreign policy, this platform differs little in its basic aspects from the platform adopted by the Republican National Convention two weeks earlier. Like the Republican platform, the Democratic platform calls for a continuation of current policies, such as "total diplomacy," military alliances, and increased armaments for intervention and sabotage against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

According to reports, the foreign policy section of the campaign platform was drafted by the State Department some time ago and later modified with deceptive language to suit the election.

On domestic policy, the Democratic platform, as in 1948, promises a whole series of reforms, including the abolition of the universally hated Taft-Hartley Act, the enactment of civil rights legislation, the establishment of federal subsidies for education and health care, improvements in unemployment, insurance, and pension systems, and the implementation of anti-monopoly laws, etc.

The Democratic Party hypocritically repeats these promises, which helped the Democratic Party win votes in the 1948 election, but have not yet been fulfilled.

The convention adopted the platform without any discussion. After Resolution Committee Chairman McCormack read the lengthy platform to an already bored and distracted audience in a monotonous and low voice, convention chairman Rayburn demanded an immediate vote.

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, dispatch from New York by TASS: The U.S. Democratic Party campaign platform drafting subcommittee submitted the section of the U.S. Democratic Party campaign platform concerning foreign policy to the Democratic National Convention, currently being held in Chicago, for consideration on July 23rd.

The platform claims that "honorable peace" is the goal of American foreign policy. However, it is clear from the content of the platform that the peace they speak of is not true peace, but rather the current aggressive policy of the Democratic Party in foreign affairs. The drafters emphasized that the policy they are talking about is "the policy formulated under the leadership of the Democratic Party since the end of World War II."

The platform claims to support "efforts to strengthen the United Nations." But their true intentions can be seen from the following fact: the platform then praises the American intervention in Korea, and the drafters of the platform advocate for the unrestricted expansion of armaments, the conclusion of aggressive alliances, and aggressive pacts. The platform draft states that the Democratic Party will continue to support a strong national "defense" unconditionally.

The policy of dividing Germany and dragging West Germany into the imperialists' aggressive plans is given an important place in the platform.

Sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are also one of the frankly admitted goals of the Democratic Party platform.

Regarding the Middle East, the platform effectively declares its intention to inject American capital into Middle Eastern countries under the pretext of "developing the region." In addition, the platform also announces a policy of organizing an aggressive bloc of Middle Eastern countries under American leadership.

The platform draft says that Japan is an "ally" of the American imperialists. It also says that the "security treaties" concluded by the United States with Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand are indispensable steps in establishing comprehensive "common security" in the Pacific region.

The platform draft advocates continuing the policy of supporting the Kuomintang elements and organizing aggressive blocs of American countries.

The platform draft also shamelessly states: "Disarmament remains our goal," but at the same time says that the Atlantic group of countries is rearming in order to "consolidate peace."

    美民主党继续坚持侵略政策
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社芝加哥讯：民主党全国代表大会全体会议已在七月二十三日批准了竞选纲领。
    在外交政策上，这个纲领在各个基本的方面和两周前共和党全国代表大会通过的纲领很少差别。民主党的纲领和共和党的纲领一样要求继续目前的方针，如“总体外交”，军事联盟，增加军备以对苏联和人民民主国家进行干涉和破坏等。
    据报载，竞选纲领中的外交政策部分，是在若干时以前由国务院拟就的，后来用欺骗人民的词句加以修改，使之适于竞选。
    在内政政策上，民主党纲领像一九四八年一样，保证实行一整套的改革，包括废除人人痛恨的塔夫脱—哈特莱法，制订公民权利法，建立联邦对教育和卫生事业的津贴制，改善失业、保险和养老金等制度，实行反垄断法等等。
    民主党假心假意地再重复这些诺言，这些诺言曾帮助民主党在一九四八年的竞选中赢得了选票，然而至今还没有兑现。
    代表大会没有进行任何讨论就通过了这个纲领。在决议委员会主席马考麦克以单调而低沉的声音向已经厌烦而心不在焉的听众宣读了这篇冗长的纲领以后，大会主席雷朋要求立即举行投票。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：美国民主党竞选纲领起草小组委员会，已在二十三日把美国民主党竞选纲领中关于外交政策的部分提交目前正在芝加哥举行的民主党全国代表大会考虑。
    这个纲领自称“光荣的和平”是美国外交政策的目标。但是，从纲领的内容中可以很清楚地看出，他们所说的和平并不是真正的和平，而是民主党目前在外交政策上的侵略方针。起草人强调指出，他们所说的政策就是“第二次世界大战结束以后在民主党领导之下所拟订的政策”。
    纲领自称要支持“巩固联合国的努力”。但是他们真正的意思可以从下面的事实中看出来：纲领接着就赞扬美国在朝鲜的干涉行动，纲领的起草者主张没有限制地扩张军备、缔结侵略联盟与侵略公约。纲领草案说，民主党要继续无条件地支持强大的国“防”。
    分裂德国和把西德拉入帝国主义者的侵略计划中的政策，在纲领中得到重要的地位。
    对苏联和人民民主国家进行破坏活动，也是民主党纲领的直认不讳的目的之一。
    关于中东，纲领实际上是宣布要在“开发该地区”的藉口下，把美国的资本侵入中东各国去。此外，纲领还宣布要实行一个在美国领导之下，组织中东国家侵略集团的政策。
    纲领草案说日本是美帝国主义者的“盟友”。它又说，美国与日本、菲律宾、澳大利亚、新西兰订立的“安全条约”，是在太平洋区域建立全面的
    “共同安全”所必不可少的步骤。
    纲领草案主张继续实行支持国民党分子和组织美洲各国侵略集团的政策。
    纲领草案还异常无耻地说：“裁减军备仍然是我们的目标”，但是同时又说，大西洋集团各国正在为了“巩固和平”而重整军备。
