    Patriotic Production Increase Emulation Campaign in Rural Shanxi
    Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry
    A large-scale patriotic production increase emulation campaign is continuing throughout Shanxi Province. According to incomplete statistics from fifty-six counties, more than 58,000 mutual aid teams, more than 5,000 villages, and 100 farms have participated in the patriotic production increase emulation. Hundreds of thousands of individual farmers have also joined this massive movement. It is estimated that about 150,000 units across the province are involved in the competition. This mighty and powerful production army is still growing.

    The Great Power of the Patriotic Production Increase Emulation Campaign

    The patriotic production increase emulation campaign has shown great power, stimulating the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses and setting off a comprehensive patriotic production increase movement. In order to ensure the victory of the competition, Shanxi's rural areas have widely implemented organization. The competition has vigorously promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. It is estimated that there are now 300,000 mutual aid teams in the province, nearly double the number from last year. The quality of mutual aid and cooperative organizations has also improved compared to the past. In the Xingxian area, there were only more than 1,300 long-term fixed mutual aid teams last year, but this year it has developed to more than 4,200; in the Changzhi area, about 20,000 mutual aid teams have established business relationships with supply and marketing cooperatives; many mutual aid teams have organized "joint teams" in order to expand reproduction and concentrate agricultural investment, laying the foundation for the transition to agricultural production cooperatives. These are all products of the patriotic production increase emulation campaign, and they also provide a good organizational foundation for the victory of the patriotic production increase emulation campaign.

    This spring, Shanxi Province launched a mass drought prevention and resistance movement, expanding the irrigated area by more than 1.5 million mu and retaining moisture on 1.19 million mu; at the same time, a million-strong mass pest control and disaster relief movement was also launched; more than 26 million mu of grain and cotton in the province were sown in a timely manner. In many areas, mutual aid teams or individual farmers have revised and improved their production increase plans because they participated in the competition. The driving role of the patriotic production increase emulation campaign in agricultural production has been fully demonstrated; it will guarantee the successful completion of the province's agricultural production increase task for 1952.

    Strengthen Political Propaganda and Mobilization Work

    The first difficulty we encountered when launching the patriotic production increase emulation campaign this year was the problem of the "contradiction between national interests and personal interests" in the minds of many farmers. This is a problem that inevitably arises on the basis of a small-scale peasant economy. Some farmers in Lucheng reflected: "Increasing production is afraid of burdens, mutual aid is afraid of communism, and wanting to not help each other will turn individual effort into poverty." This means that some farmers are still wavering between the two paths of organizing patriotic production increase and individual development. Therefore, one of the important tasks of the leaders is to use all methods to correctly implement the Party's economic policies and to conduct widespread and in-depth education on New Democracy, patriotism, and the future of social development among farmers. The patriotic production increase emulation campaign in Shanxi this year has been carried out well mainly because political propaganda and mobilization work has been strengthened. According to statistics from Jincheng, Ronghe, Hongdong, Fencheng, Jixian, and Zhongyang counties, more than 860,000 farmers received patriotic education during the propaganda movement in May. More than fifty counties, including Changzhi, Linfen, Xiyang, Yushe, Xingxian, and Lishi, sent more than 6,000 cadres to work in rural areas to carry out patriotic propaganda; the Linfen area held a production increase competition propaganda week in order to carry out the patriotic production increase emulation campaign; Yushe, Mengxian and other places universally promoted the "Patriotic Day" system. Some counties also set up "propaganda sheds," "transmission stations," "question and answer columns," and "patriotic production clubs." This massive, widespread, and in-depth political propaganda work greatly promoted the patriotic production increase emulation campaign.

    Strengthen丰产 Technology Education, Change Farmers'
    Empirical Farming Methods
    The second difficulty we encountered in launching the patriotic production increase emulation campaign this year was the conservative thinking of many farmers who believed that they "can't plant a hundred mu and can't harvest a hundred dan" and that "production has reached its peak." This thinking seriously hindered the widespread development of the movement. This poses a task for the leadership: it is necessary to strengthen production technology education for farmers and conduct sufficient ideological mobilization. Otherwise, even if the movement is launched, it will be formalistic and without power. This year, various places have universally convened people's representative meetings, mutual aid team representative meetings, production reward meetings, and technology research meetings, fully conducted ideological mobilization for production increase, and cultivated about 140,000 activists. We adopted the method of educating farmers with the advanced experience of farmers, and the effect was very good. Farmers in Gucheng Village, Wuxiang County, learned Wang Jinyun's production experience, and the masses confidently said: "The land is the same, but the crops are divided into two kinds. Learning from Wang Jinyun, increasing production is sure to work!" Farmers in Yaodi Village, Huoxian County, listened to the propaganda about production, but they did not establish confidence in increasing production. Later, leading cadres asked farmers to discuss the production experience of Guo Sanyou in the village, and the masses said: "Corn yields a thousand, and this is what I saw with my own eyes. If he can hit a thousand, we'll hit two five hundred!" The whole village immediately launched a production increase emulation campaign. In order to strive for cotton production, some areas in southern Shanxi universally promoted Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, which improved farmers' confidence. Most of the cotton in the Linfen and Yuncheng areas has achieved multiple fertilizer and dense planting, and many farmers who have participated in the competition have formulated plans to produce 800 jin of cotton.

     Must Have Leadership and Planning
    To carry out the patriotic production increase emulation campaign well, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership and mobilize the masses to formulate realistic production plans. Eighty counties including Changzhi, Jincheng, Wuxiang, Yonghe, Puxian, and Ruicheng have established three-level patriotic production increase emulation campaign work committees at the county, district, and village levels, implementing the method of chief responsibility and establishing a work system of dedicated personnel, continuous inspection, and frequent contact. This is very important. The People's Daily editorial pointed out: "Party organizations and people's governments at all levels must regard leading the competition as an important link in leading agricultural production," and that is the meaning here. In order to carry out the competition movement throughout, it is necessary to carry out meticulous organizational work. The competition movement in Shanxi Province this year was launched in the form of selecting banners at each level, forming a challenge core, from top to bottom, from point to surface, layer by layer, and responding everywhere. This links the competition between villages and villages, groups and groups, households and households. This year, some areas have begun to formulate long-term production plans. For example, among the more than 5,700 mutual aid teams participating in the competition in Pingshun County, 2,712 teams have made long-term plans; in Jincheng, there are 7,022 teams participating in the competition, of which 108 teams have made two-year production plans, more than 3,760 teams have made full-year production plans, and more than 3,140 teams have made seasonal production plans. In order to ensure the realization of these plans, they adopted the method of "long-term plans and short-term arrangements," and formulated plans for each specific agricultural activity based on the overall plan. They also used this plan as a basis to formulate patriotic covenants and conducted regular inspections through the "Patriotic Day" system. Experience has proved that this is the most effective leadership method. Only in this way can a movement be formed, and leaders can be aware of the situation and have a clear mind. Organize evaluations and summaries in each production season
    Timely organization of evaluations and summaries with the change of seasons is the best way to promote the continuous progress of the patriotic production increase emulation campaign. After the end of spring plowing, Jincheng, Huguan, Wuxiang, Gaoping, Qingyuan, Yushe, Jiaocheng, Ruicheng and other counties carried out evaluations and summaries, and further set off a summer production increase competition. After inspecting and evaluating the spring production situation, Huguan and other counties put forward the slogan of "Insufficient base fertilizer, top dressing to make up; Rough sowing, weeding to rescue; Strengthen mutual aid teams, compete to the forefront," which encouraged the emotions of some farmers who had fallen behind in the competition. Some areas adopted the method of "hanging glory lists" and "recording production increase merits" in the evaluation, which further improved the competition emotions of the masses. This can carry out the competition movement one after another throughout the year. After the inspection, the leadership must pay attention to two tasks: on the one hand, it is necessary to persuade the backward units to strive to catch up, and earnestly help them find out the experiences and lessons and overcome specific difficulties, so as to ensure the overall realization of the production increase plan. On the other hand, the winners should be constantly educated so that they will not be arrogant or impetuous and continue to work hard. Only in this way can the normal development of the movement be maintained.

    Several Problems that Need to be Solved Urgently
    There are still many problems in the agricultural patriotic production increase emulation campaign in Shanxi Province, which must be paid attention to by leading cadres at all levels:

    (1) With the development of the patriotic production increase emulation campaign, a series of new problems have occurred. First of all, due to the development of the competition movement, the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production has been improved. Their number of cultivation and fertilization have greatly increased. But many people have doubts about this approach, fearing that "the crops will grow crazy." Secondly, many people require supply and marketing cooperatives to supply a large number of new agricultural tools and fine varieties, and these things have a "supply shortage" phenomenon. We must strengthen the supply work of supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as the guidance of state-owned farms on agricultural technology, to meet the needs of the people. We must constantly and deeply understand the production situation and thinking of the people, and help them solve all the problems that occur in the movement.

    (2) The development of the movement is still unbalanced, and the movement in some areas has not yet been fully carried out. This is mainly manifested in two aspects: (1) The points are disconnected from the surface, "the points are booming, and the surface is cold."

    (2) Activists are disconnected from the masses, "activists are making a lot of noise, and the masses are silent." The reason for this phenomenon is that, on the one hand, some leading cadres have insufficient understanding that launching a patriotic production increase competition is one of the most important leadership methods to attract the majority of farmers to participate in national construction, so either "give attention to one thing and lose sight of the other" or "leave it alone," causing the movement to form a crippled phenomenon; on the other hand, some activists have insufficient understanding of their leading role, and some individuals have championshipism thinking, fearing that the masses will run ahead of them, and even intentionally do not drive the masses to move forward. Every comrade who does rural work must study various documents related to carrying out the patriotic production increase emulation campaign and various policies related to production increase rewards, further clarify their thinking, strengthen the connection between activists and the broad masses, and strive to fully carry out the patriotic production increase emulation campaign.

    (3) Some areas have "high plans, but cannot be done," which is divorced from reality and speaks big words; some areas have "low plans, but high achievements," which is intended to win championships. Some farmers still have concerns about "increased production and afraid of burdens." The leadership must constantly persuade and educate farmers, constantly strengthen investigation and research, enrich and revise plans, so that the movement can develop healthily and move forward continuously.

    山西农村的爱国增产竞赛运动
    山西省人民政府农林厅
    山西全省正在继续开展着大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动。据五十六个县不完全的总计，参加爱国增产竞赛的已有五万八千多个互助组，五千多个村庄，一百个农场。成千上万的单干农民也参加了这一巨大的运动。估计全省卷入竞赛的单位，约十五万个。这支雄壮有力的生产大军，还在继续发展着。
    爱国增产竞赛运动的巨大力量
    爱国增产竞赛运动已显示了巨大的威力，激发了群众的爱国热情，掀起了全面的爱国增产运动。为了保证竞赛运动获得胜利，山西农村广泛实行组织起来。竞赛运动极有力地推动了农村互助合作运动的发展。估计全省现有互助组三十万个，比去年扩大将近一倍。互助合作组织的质量也比过去提高了。兴县专区去年仅有长期定型的互助组一千三百多个，今年已发展到四千二百多个；长治专区约有二万个互助组已和供销合作社建立了业务的联系；许多互助组为了扩大再生产，集中农业投资，为过渡到农业生产合作社打下基础，组织了“联组”。这些都是爱国增产竞赛运动的产物，同时也给爱国增产竞赛运动的胜利准备了良好的组织基础。
    今年春季山西全省开展了群众性的防旱抗旱运动，扩大灌溉面积一百五十多万亩，保墒一百一十九万亩；同时还开展了百万群众的灭虫救灾运动；全省二千六百多万亩粮棉，做到了适时播种。有不少地区的互助组或单干农民，由于参加了竞赛，重新修改和提高了增产计划。爱国增产竞赛运动对于农业生产的推动作用，已经充分显示了出来；它将保证一九五二年全省农业增产任务的胜利完成。
     加强政治宣传鼓动工作
    今年我们发动爱国增产竞赛运动时，碰到的第一个难题是许多农民思想上的“国家利益和个人利益矛盾”的问题。这是在小农经济基础上必然产生的问题。潞城有些农民反映：“增产怕负担，互助怕共产，又想不互助，单干变穷汉。”这就是说，现在一部分农民还是动摇于组织起来爱国增产和单独发展这两条道路之间。因此，领导者的重要任务之一，就是采用一切方法，正确地贯彻党的经济政策，普遍深入地向农民进行新民主主义、爱国主义思想教育和社会发展前途的教育。今年山西的爱国增产竞赛运动所以开展得好，主要是因为加强了政治宣传鼓动工作。据晋成、荣河、洪洞、汾城、吉县、中阳六县统计，在五月份的宣传运动中，受到爱国主义教育的农民就有八十六万多人。长治、临汾、昔阳、榆社、兴县、离石等五十多县，为开展爱国主义的宣传，派了六千多个干部到农村工作；临汾专区为了开展爱国增产竞赛运动，举行了增产竞赛宣传周；榆社、盂县等地普遍地推广了“爱国日”制度。还有的县设置了“宣传棚”“传授站”“问答栏”“爱国生产俱乐部”等。这种声势浩大、普遍深入的政治宣传工作，大大地推动了爱国增产竞赛运动。
    加强丰产技术教育，改变农民
    的经验主义的耕作方法
    今年我们在发动爱国增产竞赛运动过程中碰到的第二个难题是许多农民的“种不上百亩，打不下百石”和“生产到顶”的保守思想。这种思想严重地阻碍着运动的普遍开展。这就给领导方面提出了一个任务，必须对农民加强丰产技术教育，进行充分的思想发动。否则即使运动开展起来，也是形式主义的，没有力量的。今年各地普遍地召开了各界人民代表会、互助组代表会、丰产奖励会、技术研究会，充分地进行了增产的思想动员，培养了十四万左右的积极分子。我们采用了用农民的先进经验教育农民的方法，效果很好。武乡古城村农民学习了王锦云的丰产经验，群众有信心地说：“地是一个样，庄稼两样分。学习王锦云，增产定能行！”霍县窑底村农民听了关于丰产的宣传，还没有树立增产信心。后来领导干部让农民讨论本村郭三有的丰产经验，群众说：“玉茭产一千，这才亲眼见。他能打一千，我们两五百！”全村立刻掀起增产竞赛运动。晋南若干地区为了争取棉花丰产，普遍宣传了曲耀离的植棉经验，提高了农民的信心。临汾、运城两专区的棉花大部做到了多肥密植，很多参加了竞赛的农民，订出了产棉八百斤的计划。
     一定要有领导有计划
    要把爱国增产竞赛运动开展得好，一定要加强组织领导，并发动群众订出合乎实际的生产计划。长治、晋城、武乡、永和、蒲县、芮城等八十个县，都成立了县、区、村三级爱国增产竞赛工作委员会，实行首长负责的办法，建立了专人办公、不断检查、经常联系的工作制度。这是非常重要的。人民日报社论指出：“各级党的组织和人民政府，必须把领导竞赛作为领导农业生产的重要环节”，意义就在这里。为了使竞赛运动贯彻始终，必须进行细密的组织工作。今年山西全省的竞赛运动，就是在逐级选择旗帜，组成挑战核心，自上而下，由点到面，层层发动，处处响应的形式下开展起来的。这就把村和村、组和组、户和户的竞赛连系起来了。今年有些地区已开始制订长年的生产计划。例如，平顺县参加竞赛的互助组，共五千七百多个组，其中有两千七百零一十二个组订了长年计划；晋城参加竞赛的有七千零二十二个组，其中有一百零八个组订出了二年的生产计划，三千七百六十多个组订出了全年的生产计划，三千一百四十多个组订出了季节性的生产计划。他们为了保证实现这些计划，采用了“长计划，短安排”的办法，依据总的计划订出每个具体农事活动的计划。他们并以这种计划为基础，订出爱国公约，并通过“爱国日”的制度进行定期检查。经验证明，这是最有效的领导方法。只有这样，才能形成运动，领导者才能作到心中有数，头脑清醒。在每个生产季节组织评比总结
    随着季节的转换，及时组织评比总结，是推动爱国增产竞赛运动不断前进的最好方法。在春耕结束后，晋城、壶关、武乡、高平、清源、榆社、交城、芮城等县都进行了评比总结，进一步掀起了夏季增产竞赛。壶关等县检查评比了春季生产情况以后，提出了“底肥不足，追肥补；下种粗糙，锄苗救；加强互助组，竞赛到前头”的口号，鼓舞了一部分在竞赛中落后了的农民的情绪。有些地区在评比中采取了“挂光荣榜”“记增产功”的方式，进一步提高了群众的竞赛情绪。这就可以把竞赛运动一个衔接一个地贯彻到全年了。在检查以后，领导方面必须注意两个工作：一方面要说服落后的单位努力追上去，并切实帮助他们找出经验教训，克服具体困难，以保证全面地实现增产计划。另一方面，对优胜者要进行不断的教育，使他们不骄不躁，继续努力。这样才能保持运动的正常发展。
    几个急须解决的问题
    山西省的农业爱国增产竞赛运动中还存在着不少问题，必须引起各级领导干部的重视：
    （一）随着爱国增产竞赛运动的开展，发生了一系列的新问题。首先，由于竞赛运动的开展，农民增产积极性提高了。他们的耕作次数和施肥数量，都大大增加了。但也有不少人对这种作法发生了怀疑，害怕“庄稼长疯了”。其次，许多群众要求供销合作社供给大量的新式农具和优良品种，而这些东西发生了“供不应求”的现象。我们必须加强供销合作社的供应工作，以及国营农场对农业技术的指导工作，以满足群众的要求。我们必须不断地深入地了解群众的生产情况和思想情况，帮助他们解决运动中发生的一切问题。
    （二）运动的发展还不平衡，部分地区的运动还没有全面开展。主要表现在这样两方面：（1）点和面脱节，“点里轰轰烈烈，面上冷冷清清”。
    （2）积极分子和群众脱节，“积极分子闹得热火朝天，广大群众无声无响”。发生这种现象的原因，一方面是部分领导干部对于发动爱国增产竞赛是吸引广大农民参加国家建设的最重要的领导方法之一认识不足，因而不是“顾此失彼”就是“放任不理”，使运动形成跛足现象；另一方面是一部分积极分子对自己的带头作用认识不足，个别人有锦标主义思想，怕群众跑在自己前面，甚至有意不去带动群众前进。每个做农村工作的同志，必须学习有关开展爱国增产竞赛运动的各种文件和有关增产奖励的各种政策，把思想进一步明确起来，加强积极分子和广大群众的联系，为全面开展爱国增产竞赛运动而努力。
    （三）有的地区“计划高，作不到”，脱离实际，说大话；有的地区“计划低，作的高”，目的为了夺锦标。有的农民至今仍有“增了产怕负担”的顾虑。领导方面必须不断地说服教育农民，不断地加强调查研究，充实和修正计划，使运动健康地发展，不停地前进。
