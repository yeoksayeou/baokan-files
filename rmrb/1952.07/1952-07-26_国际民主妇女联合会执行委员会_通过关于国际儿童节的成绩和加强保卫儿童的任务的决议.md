Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 25th. According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, which concluded its meeting in Bucharest on the 23rd, passed a resolution on "Achievements of International Children's Day and Tasks for Strengthening the Protection of Children," stating that the protection of children is one of the main tasks of the International Democratic Women's Federation. The Executive Committee requests its affiliated national women's organizations to do their utmost to publicize and implement the resolutions of the Vienna International Conference for the Protection of Children, and to launch a vigorous movement for the protection of children in various countries. National women's organizations must strongly support existing national committees for the protection of children, or promote the establishment of such committees, and assist in holding national and local conferences for the protection of children. Special attention should be paid to every issue related to children, and concrete measures should be formulated to launch a movement for the protection of children. These issues are: the establishment of children's homes, schools, and nurseries, opposition to the exploitation of child labor, and the prohibition of harmful films, publications, and other forms of war propaganda. Governments should allocate large sums of money to meet the needs of children, and national women's organizations must expose governments that use the majority of their budgets for war. The resolution calls on the people of all countries to publicize the situation of children in all countries, especially the situation of children in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation has instructed the Secretariat to study the possibility of cooperation between the International Democratic Women's Federation and other international organizations engaged in activities related to children's issues.
