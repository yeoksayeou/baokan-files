    The Starting Point of Agricultural Mechanization
    By Our Correspondent Tian Liu
    The North Manchurian prairie in June is a sea of green. The boundless wheat fields are already bearing plump ears of wheat; the flourishing soybeans, each one robust and full, with strong stems and lush leaves. In the vast fields of Jixian County, farmers wearing straw hats, cracking their whips, control fine horses pulling weeders and cultivators, singing ditties, and working freely and contentedly. Because of the use of new agricultural tools, the summer weeding work in the hot weather has also become easy and pleasant.
    Jixian County is a key county in Songjiang Province for promoting new agricultural tools. The county has now promoted more than 900 combined cultivators. In the seven districts, thirty-four villages, seventy-two agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, more than four thousand hectares of land have been cultivated using a full set of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements. Xiaomingjia Village is the earliest village in the county to use new agricultural tools. This small village of less than fifty households has already used five sets of Soviet horse-drawn farm implements.
    When farmers talk about new agricultural tools, they are like soldiers talking about their beloved guns, always full of praise. Liu Wenju, a member of the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaomingjia Village, said, "With the new agricultural tools, we farmers can finally separate from the cattle and horses."
    When I visited the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative, the village chief had me eat at his house. During the meal, we often talked about things in the village. He was particularly interested in new agricultural tools and talked about them the most. "In the past, farmers were called people who suffered, and it was true that farming was suffering!" he said. "The work done by cattle and horses, farmers had to do it all; what cattle and horses couldn't do, people had to do it too. After a day of suffering, lying on the kang at night, arms and legs aching, unable to even turn over." Old Liu sighed deeply at this point. He must have been thinking of the suffering of farming in the past. "Since the Communist Party came, even farming has changed." After a long time, Old Liu said admiringly, "Now, just harness the horses, crack the whip, and follow the machine, and the land will be cultivated well."
    In the past, the farm tools used by farmers in this area were crude and clumsy. Using a large wooden plow pulled by four or six horses, both people and horses were exhausted, and only five or six mu of land could be plowed in a day. Sowing was done by dribbling seeds from a gourd or by hand, which was not only laborious and time-consuming, but the crops that grew were also in clumps, not in rows or ridges. "Look at our seeder, it sows a dozen rows at once, and singing ditties, it can sow fifty or sixty mu a day." Old Liu praised their new farm implements as if counting his treasures. He spoke of various types of foreign plows, from disc harrows to soil compactors; from seeders to harvesters and threshers; he talked about them one by one. Finally, he drew a conclusion about the new agricultural tools: "The new agricultural tools are truly like the sons of Yang Linggong, each one better than the last, using them for cultivation, the plowing is deep, the work is fine, and the grain yield is exceptionally high."
    Jixian County began to promote new agricultural tools in 1950. In recent years, thanks to the vigorous promotion by the People's Government and the establishment of specialized agricultural technology extension stations to help and guide farmers in mastering new agricultural technologies, the benefits of new agricultural tools have become increasingly apparent. A seeder can sow sixty mu a day; a foreign plow can plow fifteen mu a day; the harvester is even more efficient. During the wheat harvest season, people can sit on the harvester's seat, raise their whips, sing ditties, and harvest the wheat. Sun Yuxiu is a mother with a twenty-year-old son. The difficult life in the past damaged her health, making her sallow and weak. Now she uses a harvester to cut wheat, and in three days she harvested one hundred and eighty mu. What strong young man can harvest sixty mu of wheat in a day? The thresher is even more wonderful. Regardless of gender, as long as the diesel engine is turned on, a small thresher can thresh seven thousand catties of wheat a day, and a large one can thresh thirty-four thousand catties a day. If you grow three to five hundred mu of wheat, it can be threshed in two or three days.
    As the old saying goes, skillful hands are not as good as good tools. New agricultural tools have brought many changes to the rural economy. New agricultural tools are efficient, can cultivate deeply and meticulously, and improve cultivation methods. The yield of land cultivated with new agricultural tools is much higher than that of land cultivated with old agricultural tools. Last year, the wheat grown with new agricultural tools yielded 2,600 catties per hectare, which was 20% higher than the highest yield of land cultivated with old agricultural tools. Liu Wenbin's mutual aid team in Xiaomingjia Village harvested 4,260 catties of wheat from eight mu of land, more than double the yield of land cultivated with old agricultural tools. All the mutual aid teams that used new agricultural tools have expanded their cultivated area or freed up manpower and horsepower for sideline production. Therefore, their income is much higher than that of ordinary farmers, and their lives are improving faster than others. Yang Bao's mutual aid team in Damingjia Village added six large carts, eight horses, and more than two hundred mu of land in the first year after using new agricultural tools. There are many uncultivated virgin lands in North Manchuria, and as long as you have the strength, you can open up as much as you want. New agricultural tools have given farmers the power to expand their cultivated area.
    The changes brought about by new agricultural tools to the rural economy are extensive and far-reaching. In order to better utilize the efficiency of new agricultural tools, farmers have been selling cattle to buy horses, and selling weak horses to exchange for strong horses. Last year, the county bought 1,500 tall and strong horses. A set of new agricultural tools can cultivate eighty hectares of land, and individual farmers cannot use it on small plots of land. In order to use new agricultural tools, individual households have organized themselves, and small seasonal mutual aid teams have developed into large, long-term mutual aid teams, and basic mutual aid teams have been upgraded to agricultural production cooperatives. This year, 80% of the farmers in the county have been organized, but the number of mutual aid teams has changed from 2,200 to 1,500—many small mutual aid teams have become large mutual aid teams.
    The vast majority of farmers are demanding the use of new agricultural tools. Last autumn, Wu Hongfu's group in Yongfa Village asked the district people's government to "intercede" with the agricultural technology extension station, requesting a loan for a set of new agricultural tools. The comrades at the extension station said, "Your group hasn't plowed the land in the autumn, so you don't meet the conditions for using new agricultural tools."
    Wu Hongfu asked, "How much land do we have to plow to get a loan?"
    "At least twenty-five hectares."
    Wu Hongfu ran back to the village and immediately mobilized the entire group, hitched up eight plows, and plowed twenty-five hectares of land in one go. This year, a total of more than two hundred mutual aid teams in the county requested loans for new agricultural tools. The extension station, fearing that its technical guidance force would not be sufficient, only lent out seventy-five sets. Such a small number could not meet the needs of the farmers. The farmers in the Ninth District, through the supply and marketing cooperative in their village, transferred to the district and county cooperatives, and then to the Qiulin Company, directly purchased fifteen threshers and harvesters from the Soviet Union.
    However, the farmers in Jixian County did not initially love new agricultural tools like this.
    In the spring of 1950, the People's Government called on farmers to use new agricultural tools. At that time, many farmers did not believe it, and no one wanted to use them. Later, the People's Government proposed the conditions of lending agricultural tools, lending seeds, and guaranteeing yields, and only then was a set promoted in Li You's mutual aid team in Xiaomingjia Village. As a result, the crops in this group grew very well. The farmers' understanding of new agricultural tools began to change. However, this was far from solving all the problems, and changing farmers' traditional farming methods and habits was by no means an easy task. Young people understood, but old people didn't. They understood for a while, but occasionally encountered setbacks and returned to the old ways.
    Xu Liansheng, chairman of the Bao'an Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District, described to me in detail the process by which he and his members accepted new agricultural tools.
    In 1950—the year when the promotion of new agricultural tools began—the extension station, in order to improve farmers' understanding of new agricultural tools, mobilized farmers from various villages to visit the wheat grown by Li You's mutual aid team in Xiaomingjia Village using new agricultural tools. Xu Liansheng was also mobilized at that time. He was a Communist Party member and the leader of a mutual aid team. He thought: During the visit, the cadres might ask, "How is the wheat grown with new agricultural tools compared to the wheat grown with old agricultural tools?" He had heard a long time ago that other people's wheat was growing well, and he couldn't lie with his eyes open. If the cadres asked again, "Since the crops grown with new agricultural tools are good, Old Xu, will your group use new agricultural tools?" Then what could he say? If he said yes, he didn't have a clear idea in his mind. Was it all the credit of the new agricultural tools? If he said no, it was clear that machines were used for farming, saving labor and getting good results, and the crops were growing well, so how could he say it? After thinking about it, he still excused himself by saying, "I have something to do and can't spare the time, I'll go another time when I'm free!"
    In fact, Xu Liansheng really wanted to see what was going on. After the cadres left, he went to visit secretly. Seeing is believing. He was immediately fascinated by the wheat of Li You's mutual aid team. The wheat was neatly arranged, half a person tall, the seedlings were evenly distributed, and the stalks were thick and leafy, with large ears of wheat as thick as fingers. Xu Liansheng was extremely envious. When he went back and discussed it with everyone in the group, the young people all said they would try it. The older people were skeptical, but they couldn't resist the young people, so they decided to borrow a set from the government and prepare to use new agricultural tools for farming the following year—1951.
    In the spring of 1951, Xu Liansheng received the new agricultural tools from the agricultural technology extension station. When everyone saw them, they were all weird and strange things, and many people were a little suspicious again. Sun Yutai, a member of the group, originally planned to grow four hectares of wheat. Seeing that the seeder "didn't look like anything," he thought: It's hard enough to sow evenly by hand, can this thing grow good wheat? He said to Xu Liansheng, "Let others use it first, I won't grow wheat on my four hectares of land!"
    At this time, party members played an exemplary role and first used the seeder to sow their own wheat. On the day of sowing for Xie Huaixiang, a party member, Sun Yutai went to the field early to wait. He wanted to see how this thing actually farmed. The seeder moved, he followed; the seeder stopped, he followed, specifically looking for any shortcomings of the seeder. That day, it happened to be a strong wind, and people could hardly open their eyes, but the seeder was still sowing as usual. Old Sun squatted down and dug out the seeds in the furrow, not crooked, not slanted, even and neat. He didn't find any shortcomings of the seeder, but he found the problems with the old method of sowing. Old Sun said, "Dribbling seeds from a gourd is uneven, and the wind blows them off course. This thing looks clumsy, but it's very clever to use. It sows quickly when you walk quickly, and it sows slowly when you walk slowly, and the wind doesn't matter, it's easy to use, easy to use." That night, he was too embarrassed to come forward himself, so he sent his ten-year-old son to say to Xu Liansheng, "My dad said to ask you, is the seeder free? We want to grow wheat on that piece of land again!"
    Farmers have gone from initial rejection and doubt to later welcome and acceptance from their own personal experience. Jixian County has developed from one set of new agricultural tools in Li You's mutual aid team in 1950 to seventy-five sets this year. In June, when I visited the Jixian Agricultural Technology Extension Station, they had already made a plan to promote another six hundred sets next year based on the needs of the farmers. At that time, more than 60% of the county's arable land will be cultivated with new agricultural tools.
    In order to further enable the vast majority of farmers to recognize the benefits of mechanized agriculture, the People's Government equipped the extension station with four tractors last year. The agricultural technology extension station used tractors to help farmers thresh grain and plow the land. At this time, the farmers were even happier. It turned out that the farm implements attached to the back of the tractor were the new agricultural tools they were currently using. The farmers said, "So new agricultural tools have this benefit, as long as we replace the horses with tractors, we will be mechanized."
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the rural areas of the Northeast are all the same. Within five or six years, all of the Northeast, except for the mountainous areas, will use new agricultural tools, and some farmers will use tractors. At that time, agricultural production in the Northeast will not increase by ten or several tens of percent, but will increase many times over.
    New agricultural tools are like a bridge, through which we can go straight to the wonderful paradise of mechanized agriculture.

    农业机械化的起点
    本报记者  田流
    六月的北满草原，到处一片葱绿。望不到边的麦田，已抽出肥硕的麦穗；繁茂的大豆，一棵棵肥头大耳，茎壮叶肥。在集贤县的广大田野上，农民们头戴草帽，手摇马鞭，控制着骏马拉着的除草机、铲?机，口里唱着小曲，自由自在地劳动着。因为使用了新农具，酷热天时的夏锄作业，也变得轻松愉快了。
    集贤县是松江省推广新农具的重点县。现在全县已推广了九百多部综合号铲?机。在七个区、三十四个村屯、七十二个农业生产合作社和互助组的四千多公顷土地上，已使用了全套的苏联式马拉农具耕耘。小明甲村是全县使用新农具最早的村庄，这个不满五十户的小庄子，已使用了五套苏联马拉农具。
    农民们谈起新农具，就像战士们谈起他们的心爱的枪，总是赞不绝口。小明甲村先锋农业生产合作社社员刘文举说：“使上新农具，咱农民才算跟牛马分家了。”
    访问先锋农业生产合作社时，村长把我的饭派在他家里，吃饭的时候，我们常常谈起村里的事情。他对新农具特别感兴趣，在这方面谈的最多。“早先，人家叫庄稼人是受苦人，说种地是受苦，一点不假啊！”他说：“牛马干的活，庄稼人全得干；牛马不会干的，人也得干。受一天，到黑夜躺在炕上，胳臂腿生疼，连身也翻不过来呀。”老刘说到这里，深深地叹一口气。他一定是想起过去种地的苦楚来了。“共产党来了，连种地也变了样子。”过了好久，老刘赞慕地说：“如今，只要套上马，把鞭子一摇，人跟着机器走，就把地种好了。”
    过去，这一带农民使用的农具，又粗又笨。使用四匹马或六匹马拉的大木犁，人马累个半死，一天才翻五、六亩地。播种是用葫芦点籽或用手撒籽，费劲费工且不说它，种出来的庄稼，还是一堆一块的，行不成行，垄不成垄。“看咱的播种机，一下就是十几行，唱着小曲，一天也种它五、六十亩。”老刘像数家珍似的，又夸奖起他们的新式农具。他从各种不同功能的洋犁，说到圆盘耙、镇压器；从播种机说到收割机、脱谷机；一件一件说了个遍。末后，还给新农具下了个结论：“新农具真是杨令公的儿子，一个赛如一个，用它养种，耕的深、作的细，粮食收的分外多。”
    集贤县是从一九五○年开始推广新农具的。几年来，由于人民政府大力提倡，设立了专门的农业技术推广站，帮助和指导农民掌握新的农业技术，就使得新农具的好处，一天比一天发挥出来。播种机
    一天能播种六十亩；洋犁一天能翻地十五亩；收割机效率更高，麦收时节，人坐在收割机的座位上，扬着马鞭，唱着小曲，就把麦子割下来了。孙玉秀是个有了二十岁的儿子的母亲，过去的艰难生活，损害了她的健康，面黄肌瘦，身体很弱。她现在用收割机割麦子，三天就割了一百八十亩。什么样的壮实小伙子，一天能割六十亩麦子呢？脱谷机就更妙了，不论男女，只要把柴油机一开，小脱谷机一天能脱出七千斤麦子，大的一天能脱三万四千斤。种个三、五百亩麦子，两三天就脱完了。
    古话说，手巧不如家什妙。新农具使农村经济发生了许多变化。新农具效率高，能够深耕细作，改良耕作方法。用新农具种的地，其产量比用旧农具种的地高多了。去年，新农具种的小麦，一公顷收获二千六百斤，比用旧农具耕作的土地的最高产量，还多百分之二十。小明甲村刘文彬互助组八亩地，收获了四千二百六十斤麦子，比用旧农具种的土地的产量，高出一倍多。凡是使用新农具的互助组，都扩大了耕地面积，或是抽出人工马力，进行副业生产。因此，他们的收入比一般农民多的多，生活比别人上升的快。大明甲村杨宝互助组使用新农具后的第一年，就添了六辆大车，八匹马，还增加了二百多亩地。北满有很多没有开垦的处女地，只要有力量，能够随意开多少。新农具给了农民扩大耕地面积的力量。
    新农具在农村经济上引起的变化是广泛而深远的。农民们为了更好地发挥新农具的效率，纷纷卖牛买马，卖弱马换壮马。去年全县买入一千五百匹高头大马。一套新农具能耕作八十公顷土地，单干的农民在小块土地上使不了它。为了使用新农具，单干户纷纷组织起来，小型的季节性的互助组向大型的长年的互助组发展，有基础的互助组提高到农业生产合作社。今年全县组织起来的农民已占百分之八十，互助组的数目却由二千二百个变成了一千五百个——许多小型互助组变成大型互助组了。
    广大农民都要求使用新农具。去年秋天，永发屯吴洪福小组请区人民政府向农业技术推广站“说情”，要求贷给一套新农具。推广站的同志说：“你们组没有秋翻地，不够使用新农具的条件。”
    吴洪福问：“翻多少地才贷给我们呢？”
    “至少二十五公顷。”
    吴洪福跑回村庄，立时动员了全组的人马，套出八付犁，一气就翻了二十五公顷地。这一年，全县共有二百多互助组请求贷给新农具，推广站怕自己的技术指导力量不够，只贷出七十五套。这样小的数目，那能满足农民的要求呢？九区的农民通过本村的供销合作社，转区和县的合作社，又转到秋林公司，从苏联直接买来了十五部脱谷机和收割机。
    但是，集贤县的农民，并不是一开始就这样热爱新农具的。
    一九五○年春，人民政府就号召农民使用新农具。当时许多农民都不相信，叫谁使谁也不使。后来，人民政府提出贷农具，贷种籽，保证产量的条件，才算在小明甲村李有互助组推广了一套。结果这个组的庄稼长的很好。农民对新农具的认识，这才开始转变了。但是，这还远远没有解决全部问题，改变农民传统的耕作方法和习惯，绝不是一件轻而易举的事。青年人想通了，老年人想不通。一时想通了，偶尔遇到波折，又回到老路子上去了。
    二区保安屯农业生产合作社主席徐连生对我详细叙述了他和他的社员们接受新农具的经过情形。
    一九五○年——开始推广新农具的那一年，推广站为了提高农民对新农具的认识，动员各村农民到小明甲村参观李有互助组用新农具种的小麦。当时也动员了徐连生。他是共产党员，又是互助组长。他想：参观时干部可能要问：“新农具种的麦子比旧农具种的怎么样？”人家麦子长的好，早就听说了，不能睁着眼说瞎话。要是干部再问：“既然新农具种的庄稼好，老徐，你们组用不用新农具？”那时可用何言答对？说用吧，心里又不摸底。这难道都是新农具的功劳？说不用吧，明明机器种地，省工出活，庄稼又长的好，怎么能说出口来呢？想来想去，还是推托说：“有事分不开身，有空再去吧！”
    其实，徐连生真想看个究竟。干部走后，他自己悄悄去参观。真是耳闻不如目见。他一下就被李有互助组的小麦迷住了。麦子齐刷刷的，有半人高，苗眼整齐均匀，棵棵茎粗叶肥，硕大的麦穗有手指粗。徐连生羡慕得不得了。回来同全组人一核计，青年人都说试试，上年岁的将信将疑，但扭不过年青人，就决定向政府贷一套，准备来年——一九五一年，也用新农具种地。
    一九五一年春天，徐连生从农业技术推广站领来新农具。大家一看，净是些七楞八叉怪里怪气的东西，好些人又有些疑惑了。组员孙玉太本来计划种四公顷小麦，看见播种机“不像个样子”，就想：用手还点不匀哩，使这玩艺还能种好麦子？他对徐连生说：“先让别人使吧，我那四公顷地不种小麦啦！”
    这时候，党员起模范作用，先用播种机种自家的小麦。给党员谢怀祥播种的那天，孙玉太早早地就到地里等着去了。他要看看这玩艺到底怎么种地法。播种机走，他跟着走，播种机停，他跟着停，专门看播种机有什么缺点。那天碰巧刮大风，人们的眼都睁不开，可是播种机还是照样播种。老孙蹲下来，刨刨垄沟里的种籽，不歪不斜，均匀整齐。播种机的缺点没找着，倒找出旧法播种的毛病了。老孙说：“葫芦点子不匀，刮风撒不正，看这玩艺，长的挺笨，用起来很巧。紧走紧下籽，慢走慢下籽，刮风也不碍事，好使好使。”那天晚上，他自己不好意思出面，派他十来岁的儿子去向徐连生说：“我爹说叫我问问你，播种机有工夫没有，我们那块地又想种小麦啦！”
    农民们就是从他们自己的亲身经验中，由最初的拒绝、怀疑，到后来的欢迎、接受。集贤县已由一九五○年李有互助组的一套新农具，发展到今年的七十五套了。六月，我去访问集贤农业技术推广站时，他们已根据农民的要求，作出明年再推广六百套的计划。那时候，占全县百分之六十以上的耕地，都要用新农具耕耘了。
    人民政府为了进一步使广大农民认识机械农业的好处，去年给推广站配备了四台拖拉机。农业技术推广站用拖拉机帮助农民脱谷、翻地。这时候农民更乐了。原来拖拉机后面带的农具，就是自己现今使用的新农具。农民说：“原来新农具还有这么个好处，只要把马换成拖拉机，咱们也就机械化了。”
    在共产党领导下，东北的农村，到处都是一样。五六年之内，全东北除山地外，都将使用新农具，并有一部分农民将要使用拖拉机。那时候，东北的农业生产将不是百分之十几或者几十，而将成倍的提高起来。
    新农具就像一座桥，通过它，可以一直走向美妙的机械化农业的乐园。
