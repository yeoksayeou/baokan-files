Protest the American Bombing of the Yalu River Power Plants

[By Our Own Correspondent] Democratic parties and people's organizations such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League Headquarters, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the New Democratic Youth League have issued written statements protesting the barbaric act of the American aggressors in bombing the Yalu River power plants and other peaceful facilities. They also issued a stern warning to the American aggressors that their sinister schemes will inevitably backfire in the face of the angry and just people.

The spokesperson of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated: "This crazy and brutal bombing of the Yalu River power plants by American air force bandits has aroused the anger, condemnation, and protests of the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people around the world. It once again exposes the sinister scheme of the American imperialists to deliberately expand the Korean War and threaten peace in Asia and the world." "We believe that due to the perverse actions of the American aggressors, the fighting will and strength of the people of China and Korea have been strengthened, and the peace-loving people of the world have been more closely united to thoroughly defeat this most ferocious and dangerous enemy."

The spokesperson of the China Democratic League Headquarters stated: "While shamelessly delaying and unscrupulously undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have inhumanely and indiscriminately bombed the Yalu River power plants on the Sino-Korean border, severely damaging the peaceful facilities of daily life for millions of people. This crime of the American aggressors once again proves their determination not to have an armistice, not to have peace, but to expand the war of aggression against Korea and further endanger peace in Asia and the world." "We want to warn the American imperialists: The heroic Chinese and Korean people have never been intimidated by any act of violence in the past, and they will never be shaken by any new provocation now. The sinister schemes of the aggressors will inevitably backfire in the face of the angry and just people. All members of our China Democratic League will definitely unite with the people of the whole country to respond to the mad provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions, and continue to strive for the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending peace!"

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: "The Chinese working class expresses its unparalleled anger and lodges a firm protest against this unprecedented atrocity of American imperialism. We want to tell the American aggressors: Your attempt to intimidate the people of China and Korea with this crazy bombing is absolutely impossible. Your attempt to use this so-called 'military pressure' to obtain what you cannot obtain at the Korean armistice negotiation table is absolutely impossible. This crime of yours that provokes peace in Asia and the world can only arouse the anger and hatred of the people of China and Korea, can only strengthen the strong fighting spirit of the people of China and Korea, and can only be punished by the people of the world.

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement saying: "The continuous bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants, which are necessary for the lives of the Korean people, by American imperialism fully exposes its conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, deliberately expand the Korean War, and harm peaceful people. This inhuman crime has further aroused the anger of peace-loving people all over the world. We Chinese women must turn our anger into strength, work hard to increase production and practice economy, and continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army until the Korean issue is resolved fairly and reasonably."

The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued a joint statement saying: "The American aggressors have carried out a large-scale and frenzied bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants, which are completely non-military targets that supply the needs of the vast majority of peaceful people. This is another deliberate attempt by the American aggressors to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, a further provocation to peace in Asia and the world, and an extremely despicable and criminal act that completely violates humanity. This heinous crime of the American aggressors has aroused unparalleled anger among Chinese youth. Chinese youth will, together with the people of the whole country, make greater efforts to carry out the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and give the American aggressors a greater and heavier blow."

    抗议美国轰炸鸭绿江发电厂暴行
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟总部和中华全国总工会、全国民主妇联和新民主主义青年团等民主党派和人民团体，纷纷发表书面谈话，抗议美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂等和平设施的野蛮暴行，并严重警告美国侵略者，它的罪恶阴谋必将在愤怒的正义人民面前自食其果。
    中国国民党革命委员会发言人发表谈话说：“这次美国空军强盗疯狂残暴地轰炸鸭绿江发电厂，引起了中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒、谴责和抗议；也再一次从事实上暴露了美帝国主义者蓄意扩大朝鲜战争、威胁亚洲和全世界和平的罪恶阴谋。”“我们相信：由于美国侵略者的倒行逆施，更加强了中朝两国人民的战斗意志和力量，更使全世界爱好和平人民紧密地团结在一起，共同来彻底地击败这一最凶恶最危险的敌人。”
    中国民主同盟总部发言人发表谈话说：“美国侵略者在无赖地拖延和无耻地破坏朝鲜停战谈判的时候，竟又灭绝人性地滥炸我中朝边界的鸭绿江发电厂，严重破坏了千百万人民日常生活的和平设施。美国侵略者的这一罪行，再一度证明了它决心不要停战，不要和平，而决心扩大侵朝战争，进一步危害亚洲及世界和平的阴谋。”“我们要警告美帝国主义者：英勇的朝中人民过去不曾为任何暴行所吓倒，现在也绝不会因任何新的挑衅而动摇。侵略者的罪恶阴谋必将在愤怒的正义人民面前自食其果。我们中国民主同盟全体盟员，一定和全国人民一道，以实际行动来回答美国侵略者的疯狂挑衅，再接再厉地为抗美援朝、保卫和平的胜利而奋斗到底！”
    中华全国总工会发表声明说：“中国工人阶级对于美帝国主义这种旷古未闻的暴行，表示无比的愤怒并提出坚决的抗议。我们要告诉美国侵略者：你们妄想用这种疯狂滥炸的手段来恫吓朝中人民是绝对办不到的，你们妄想用这种所谓‘军事压力’来取得在朝鲜停战谈判桌上所不能取得的东西是绝对不可能的，你们这种对亚洲及世界和平挑衅的罪行，只能激起朝中人民的愤怒和仇恨，只能增强朝中人民的强烈的斗志，只能遭到世界人民的责罚。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会发表声明说：“美帝国主义最近连续不断地轰炸朝鲜人民生活所需的鸭绿江水力发电厂，充分暴露了它破坏朝鲜停战谈判，蓄意扩大朝鲜战争，残害和平人民的阴谋。这种灭绝人性的罪行，更加激起了全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒。我们全中国妇女一定把愤怒变成力量，努力增产节约，继续支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，直到朝鲜问题得到公平合理的解决为止。”
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会发表联合声明说：“美国侵略者对供给广大和平人民生活需要的鸭绿江水力发电厂这个完全非军事目标，进行了大规模的疯狂的轰炸，这是美国侵略者又一次蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判、对亚洲和世界和平作进一步的挑衅、彻底违反人道的极端卑劣的罪恶行为。美国侵略者这种万恶罪行，已激起中国青年无比的愤怒。中国青年将和全国人民一起，以更大的努力，开展爱国增产节约运动，支援朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军，给美国侵略者以更大的更沉重的打击。”
