    Changlu Salt Affairs Bureau
    Self-criticism of the Haixing Factory's Unplanned Production and Lack of Responsibility

    To the Editors: We sincerely accept the criticism made by comrades Shao Zhenpeng and Lin Zhaoxiang in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 7 regarding the Haixing Factory in Hangu Town lacking direction and planning in production.

    The Haixing Factory in Hangu Town is our bureau's production unit (now taken over by the Tianjin Special District Enterprise Company). During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, this factory experienced sluggish sales of finished products, a backlog of funds, and inactive business operations. Furthermore, the director and deputy director were respectively suspended and dismissed. We also focused our efforts on the "Three-Anti" movement, thus neglecting the leadership of the Haixing Factory's business operations. Although we sent people to temporarily replace the director and deputy director, they were unable to effectively promote the work due to their lack of familiarity with the business. Furthermore, given that the bureau's production was pending handling and transfer, a selfish departmentalism mentality of eagerly pushing it away and avoiding responsibility arose, leaving the factory's work unattended and causing chaos. These errors were mainly caused by our lack of planning and bureaucratism in our work. In addition to continuing to conduct in-depth self-criticism, we have accepted this lesson and will use it as a reference for our future work.

### 长芦盐务管理局  对海兴工厂生产无计划无人负责的检讨

    对海兴工厂生产无计划无人负责的检讨
    编辑同志：四月七日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的邵振鹏、林兆祥二同志对海兴工厂在生产上无方向无计划的批评，我们诚恳地接受。
    汉沽镇海兴工厂是我局的机关生产单位（现已由天津专区企业公司接办），在“三反”和“五反”期间，这个厂的成品滞销、资金积压，业务不活跃，正、副经理又分别受到停职撤职处分，我们又集中力量搞“三反”运动，因而忽略了海兴工厂业务上的领导。当时虽然也派人代替正、副经理职务，但他们因业务不够熟悉，未能有效地推动工作，又在机关生产有待处理移交的情况下，就产生了急于推出不负责任的本位主义思想，使工厂工作陷于无人照顾，工作呈现紊乱。这些错误主要是我们工作上无计划和官僚主义所造成的。我们除继续深入检讨外，已接受这一教训，作为我们今后工作上的借鉴。
