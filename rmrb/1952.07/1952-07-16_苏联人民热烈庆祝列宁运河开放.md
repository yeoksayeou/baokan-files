Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 15th: The Soviet people warmly welcome the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to open the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal. These days, from the Baltic Sea to Transcaucasia, from Belarus to the Far East, working people in thousands upon thousands of factories, farms, institutions, schools, and military units have held grand rallies and symposiums to celebrate the victorious completion of the canal project. The mood is particularly enthusiastic in Moscow's "Red Proletarian" machine-building plant and many enterprises that supplied machinery for the construction of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal. Many factory workers have decided to celebrate the opening of the canal with over-quota production. Scientific personnel in Moscow's research and design institutions are also working enthusiastically to complete new tasks related to communist construction projects. In Belarus, Bakhmatov, a Stakhanovite draftsman at the Minsk Machine Building Plant, said: "The most courageous dreams of the working people have been realized. In a very short time, the greatest and most complex construction has appeared in our country. This is the significance of the Soviet regime."

Moscow newspapers have published editorials for days and devoted large amounts of space to articles by prominent figures, warmly congratulating the completion of the canal. The editorial in the Pravda on the 13th said: "The construction of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal vividly illustrates the great strength of the Soviet social and state system. Honest people all over the world, by comparing the living conditions of countries in the peace camp with those in capitalist countries, can see how much better a policy of peace is than a policy of inciting new wars." The editorial in the Izvestia on the 12th stated: The Soviet people clearly recognize the important significance of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal to the national economy. They consider it the first great construction completed in the coming years according to the ingenious Stalin plan, and these great constructions will enable the Soviet Union to stride towards communism. The victory of the builders of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal is the victory of a powerful socialist industry, and the victory of the world's most advanced Soviet science.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: According to TASS, Kalach, July 11th: Filimonov, the Deputy Chief Engineer of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal construction project, told TASS reporters about the enormous scale and technical level of the canal project: The construction workers of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal completed this great project within three years, according to the date stipulated by the Soviet Communist Party and the government. A total of 152.21 million cubic meters of earth were excavated and transported on the canal, and the total amount of reinforced concrete and concrete construction was nearly 3 million cubic meters. The working speed of the construction project was very high. For example, for a long period of time, the average daily earthwork completed reached 500,000 cubic meters, and the concrete work reached 12,000 cubic meters. More than 20,000 of the Soviet Union's most advanced machines and thousands of cars and tractors were used in the project. There were 160 factories, power plants and repair shops serving the project. Because automatic concrete manufacturing plants were established and electric concrete vibrators were widely used in the project, the concrete pouring work was uninterrupted throughout the year. Giant automatic mobile excavators were used for the first time in this project, thus eliminating the need to organize manpower to carry the excavated soil. In the "Tsimlyansk Sea" dam project, 28 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed in a very short time. The project of blocking the Don River was completed in eight hours, which is the outstanding achievement of the canal builders. In addition, the builders also laid hundreds of kilometers of railways, transporting more than 2,000 trainloads of various materials on these railways every day during the most intense period of work. They also laid approximately 1,400 kilometers of transmission lines and 1,600 kilometers of telephone lines, and established stone and gravel factories. These factories can produce approximately 5 million cubic meters of crushed stone per year. In order to adapt to the high technical level of the construction project, a school was opened on site to train various workers and machine operators. Over the years, this school has trained several thousand truck drivers, excavator operators, and road grader operators. Filimonov said that the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal is not only an outstanding construction project, but also a work of great architectural significance. It demonstrates the heroism of socialist peaceful labor. All the personnel of the construction project knew that the project plan was formulated under Stalin's initiative and direct guidance, and this fact encouraged them to complete the task in the shortest possible time. The construction of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal once again demonstrates the inexhaustible potential strength of the socialist system and proves the Soviet people's firm will to love peace.

    苏联人民热烈庆祝列宁运河开放
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民热烈欢迎苏联部长会议关于开放列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的决定。这些天来，从波罗的海到外高加索，从白俄罗斯到远东各地，在成千成百的工厂、农场、机关、学校和部队里，劳动人民纷纷举行盛大集会和座谈会，庆祝运河工程的胜利完成。在莫斯科的“红色无产者”机器制造厂和许多曾以机器供给列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河建筑工程的企业中，职工的情绪特别热烈。许多工厂的工作人员决定以超计划的生产来庆祝运河的开放。莫斯科各研究机关和设计机关的科学人员也在热情地工作，以完成有关共产主义建筑工程的新任务。在白俄罗斯，明斯克机器制造厂的斯塔哈诺夫式绘图工人巴赫慕托夫说：“劳动人民最勇敢的梦想已经实现了。在很短时间之内，最伟大而且最复杂的建筑在我国出现了。苏维埃政权的意义就在这里。”
    莫斯科各报连日发表社论，并以大量篇幅刊载著名人士的文章，热烈祝贺运河的完成。真理报十三日的社论说：“列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建造，生动地说明了苏维埃社会和国家制度的伟大力量。全世界的正直人民，只要比较一下和平阵营各国和资本主义国家的生活情况，就可以看出和平政策比起煽动新战争的政策有多大的好处。”消息报在十二日发表社论说：苏联人民很清楚地认识到列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河对国民经济的重要意义。他们认为这是在未来数年中按照天才的斯大林计划所完成的第一个伟大的建设，这些伟大的建设将使苏联大踏步走上共产主义的道路。列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建设者的胜利就是强大的社会主义工业的胜利，就是全世界最先进的苏维埃科学的胜利。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社卡拉奇十一日讯：列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河建设工程的副总工程师菲力莫诺夫，对塔斯社记者谈运河工程的巨大规模和技术水平说：列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建筑工人按照苏联共产党和政府所规定的日期，在三年内完成了这个伟大的工程。运河上共挖掘和运走了一亿五千二百一十万立方公尺的泥土，建筑钢筋混凝土和混凝土工程的总量将近三百万立方公尺。建设工程的工作速度是很高的。例如，在一段很长的时期内，一昼夜完成的土方工程平均达五十万立方公尺，混凝土工程达一万二千立方公尺。工程中使用了苏联最先进的机器二万多部，汽车和拖拉机数千部。为工程服务的工厂、发电厂和修理厂有一百六十所。因为建立了自动混凝土制造厂，在工程中又广泛使用了电动混凝土震捣器，使混凝土的浇灌工作一年四季没有中断过。巨型的自动移动掘土机已第一次在这个工程中使用，因而不需要组织人力来搬运挖掘出来的泥土。在“齐姆良海”堤堰工程中，只用很短的时间就完成了二千八百万立方公尺的土方。堵塞顿河的工程八个钟头就完成了，这就是运河建设者的卓越的成绩。此外，建设者还敷设了数百公里的铁路，在工作最紧张的时候，每天在这些铁路上运输的各种物资有两千多车皮。他们还敷设了约一千四百公里的输电线和一千六百公里的电话线，并建立了打石和碎石工厂。这些工厂每年能打石碎石约五百万立方公尺。为了适应建设工程的高度技术水平，现场上开设了一所学校，训练各种工人和机器操纵者。几年来，这所学校训练出了好几千名卡车司机、挖泥机驾驶员和平路机驾驶员。菲力莫诺夫说，列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河不仅是一个杰出的工程建设，而且也是一个建筑学上很有意义的作品。它表现了社会主义和平劳动的英雄主义。建设工程的全体人员都知道：工程计划是在斯大林的倡议和直接指导下制订的，这个事实鼓舞了他们，使他们在最短期间内就完成了任务。列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建设，再一次说明了社会主义制度无穷尽的潜在力量，证明了苏联人民热爱和平的坚定意志。
