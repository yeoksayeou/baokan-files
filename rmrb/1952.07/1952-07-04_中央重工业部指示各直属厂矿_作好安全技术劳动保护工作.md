The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry issued instructions to all directly subordinate factories and mines to improve safety technology and labor protection, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the production increase and economy campaign which is about to be fully launched in the North China region. The instructions stated:

(1) For factories and mines that have already conducted a major safety inspection in 1951, the factory director and workshop directors should personally supervise and inspect the implementation of the improvement measures plan formulated during the major safety inspection. If it has been carried out according to plan, it should continue to be implemented. If the implementation is insufficient or has not been carried out, the reasons and responsibilities must be investigated and dealt with appropriately. The original plan should be quickly re-examined, and a deadline for implementation should be set so that it can be completed on schedule. For factories and mines under the jurisdiction of various specialized bureaus (groups) that have not conducted a major safety inspection, they should conduct a major safety inspection in accordance with the spirit and principles of the Ministry's autumn 1951 major safety inspection instructions, combined with the production increase and economy campaign and the specific conditions of each factory and mine, and uniformly stipulate the inspection date, or instruct the factory and mine to determine the inspection date by itself. It is required that all inspections be completed by the winter of this year at the latest. The experience of the major safety inspection in 1951 proves that doing a good job in safety technology and labor protection is a major guarantee for carrying out the production increase and economy campaign. Therefore, among leaders at all levels, it is necessary to resolutely correct and prevent the idea of ​​opposing safety production and the production increase and economy campaign. All employees must realize that only by doing a good job in safety technology and labor protection can the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees be further stimulated.

(2) Specialized bureaus (groups) and factories and mines that have not yet established full-time safety technology and labor protection agencies, or those that have been established but whose organizations are very unsound, whose cadres are not sufficient, or who frequently arbitrarily transfer cadres away, must establish and improve full-time agencies in accordance with the regulations and principles of the Ministry's 1951 Safety Inspection Work Conference, and according to the actual situation. Staffing should be reinforced, and the shortcomings of arbitrarily transferring cadres should be immediately corrected, so as to professionalize and stabilize safety technology cadres.

(3) Due to the development of industrial construction, basic construction projects will increase sharply. In order to avoid safety technology and industrial hygiene loopholes in new factories and mines after completion in the future, this issue must be carefully considered when designing new projects. Supervision and inspection should be carried out at any time during the construction period, and attention should be paid to the safety and protection of personnel during the construction process. After the completion of the new project, the safety technology and labor protection department must participate in the acceptance. If unsafe conditions are found, production can only be allowed to start after supervising the improvement.

(4) At present, there is no systematic safety education system in various factories and mines. It should be established, especially the safety education for new workers entering the factory and the safety operation guidance system for workers who have just arrived in the workshop. Safety education for existing personnel must also be carried out frequently in conjunction with the current work situation, and tests should be held.

(5) In order to effectively promote safety technology and labor protection, rewards and punishments must be clearly defined. Groups and individuals who abide by safety regulations and do not have casualties, or who have new creations and improvements in safety technology and labor protection, should be commended and rewarded in a timely manner. Those responsible for casualties must be strictly investigated and dealt with, and those who are serious will be subject to legal sanctions.

    中央重工业部指示各直属厂矿
    作好安全技术劳动保护工作
    中央人民政府重工业部为了保障华北各直属厂矿即将全面展开的增产节约竞赛运动顺利进行，特指示各直属厂矿作好安全技术劳动保护工作。指示中说：
    （一）一九五一年已进行保安大检查的厂矿，厂矿长和各车间主任应亲自督促检查保安大检查中所订改进措施计划的执行情况。如已按计划进行的，应继续贯彻。执行不够或没有执行的，必须追究原因和责任，作适当处理，并将原有计划迅速重新审订，规定实施期限，使之按期完成。各专业局（组）所属厂矿中未进行保安大检查的，应依照本部一九五一年秋季保安大检查指示的精神和原则，结合增产节约运动与各厂矿具体情况，统一规定检查日期，或指令厂矿自行决定检查日期，进行保安大检查，并要求最迟于今年冬季全部结束。一九五一年保安大检查的经验证明：做好安全技术劳动保护工作，是开展增产节约运动的一大保证。因之，在各级领导干部中，必须坚决纠正和防止把安全生产和开展增产节约运动对立起来的思想，必须使全体职工认识到：只有做好安全技术劳动保护工作，才能更进一步启发广大职工群众的生产积极性。
    （二）迄今尚未成立安全技术劳动保护专职机构的专业局（组）和厂矿，或虽已设立但组织很不健全，干部不充实或经常任意将干部调走者，均须依照一九五一年本部保安大检查工作会议的规定和原则，并按实际情况，迅速建立与健全专职机构，充实干部，并应立即纠正任意调动干部的缺点，务使安全技术干部专业化，固定化。
    （三）由于工业建设的发展，基本建设工程即将急剧增加。为了避免今后新厂矿建成时，安全技术、工业卫生上漏洞百出，在新工程设计时，必须慎重考虑此项问题。施工期间应随时进行监督检查，并要注意施工过程中人员的安全和保护。新工程完竣后，安全技术劳动保护部门必须参加验收，如发现有不安全情况，应监督改进后，才能允许开工生产。
    （四）目前各厂矿中均无较系统的安全教育制度，应当建立起来，尤以新工人入厂的安全教育及对初到车间的工人的安全操作指导制度急待建立。对于现有人员的安全教育亦须结合当前工作情况经常进行，并应举行测验。
    （五）为了切实推动安全技术劳动保护工作，务须做到赏罚严明，对遵守安全制度而经常不发生伤亡事故，或在安全技术劳动保护上有新的创造和改进的小组、个人等，要及时予以表扬奖励；对伤亡事故的责任者，必须严格追究处理，严重者，并给予法律制裁。
