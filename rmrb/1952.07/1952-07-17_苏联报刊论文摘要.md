Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

Film Scripts are Important Literature
The following is an abstract of an editorial in the Soviet "Literary Gazette" on June 12:

    Soviet audiences love domestic film art and are proud of Soviet works that have won world honors. Our audiences want to see more Soviet films - of various genres and on various themes.

    What is needed to produce more films? First and foremost, good film scripts. However, there are too few film scripts of sufficient ideological and artistic value, which limits the production of new films and hinders the growth of our film art.

    Improving the situation of film script creation and striving for high artistic skill are important conditions for the development of this most mass-based art.

    A film script is as important literature as a novel, novella, and drama. Film scripts should express profound life issues and the great ideas of the contemporary era in the vivid conflicts of the plot and in the prominent, multi-faceted characters of various figures. Careful study of the actual situation and faithfulness to life are the primary conditions for the success of film script creation.

    We often say that a film script is a perfect work of literature. However, in practice, the attitude towards film script creation is not always consistent with this correct point of view. Some writers, although acknowledging that film scripts are a valuable literary form, do not write them with the same precision as they write novels and dramas.

    Too few film scripts are written that can truly be included among important literary works and become independent literary works with unique styles and characteristics.

    The incorrect view of treating film scripts as by-products has also led our critics to look down upon this literary form.

    The basic task of Soviet writers is to reflect contemporary life and portray the Soviet people. But film script writers prefer to seize upon past themes and biographies to write film scripts.

    As in other literary works, the clear and profound ideas expressed in the activities of the characters should be the foundation of the film script. This idea should guide the activities of the film script and the development of its plot.

    The progress of our film art depends first and foremost on the work of film script writers and the quality of film scripts. The task of our writers is to ensure the supply of important literary works to the film industry and to do their best to help the further development of Soviet film art.

Dare to Delve Deeper into New Fields of Film Art

The following is an abstract of an editorial in the "Soviet Art News" on June 28:

    In the Soviet Union, film stories have now become the main form, biographical films have also been firmly established and are developing. New genres—documentaries and scientific films—are only in their initial stages, and film workers still need to make creative efforts in this regard. As for important genres such as comedies, musicals, and adventure films, they have not received due attention recently.

    Comrade Stalin said: Comedy is an important genre of Soviet art, as long as it does not mock the Soviet people but has the noble task of educating the audience, as long as it is hearty, spreads the joy of life, and helps to fight against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds. The lack of such comedies is a serious shortcoming in film script creation.

    One cannot complain that writers have not paid attention to biographical and historical film scripts. But in this regard, authors show an intention to use ready-made, proven methods, and there is not enough seeking of new forms and new methods to express various kinds of rich material. Scientific story films have slipped away from our screens, and films with a gentle lyrical flavor and full of broad and pleasant folk music from beginning to end have long been invisible. Little attention is also paid to films made for children and young people, which should have a unique style.

    However, it is also incorrect to guide artists to only pay attention to continuing to creatively pursue the development of genres more boldly. To delve deeper into new fields of film - that is, to find new forms of expression that conform to the new content of life according to the needs of life.

    The major task of studying issues related to determining the development path of film art and the characteristics of various genres belongs to our theorists and critics. They are still lagging behind the actual situation of film script creation and have not boldly and broadly summarized the creative achievements of film art.

    Our glorious past, beautiful present, and wonderful, bright future should be praised on the screen. The screen should be as moving and sincere as a drama, and as full of struggle and beautiful atmosphere as a lyrical poem. It should be full of the people's humor, reflecting the wonderful and rich thoughts, feelings, and actions of the people marching towards the great goal—communism. The creative courage of artists, theorists, and critics should be directed towards creating such works.

Doctors and Patients

The Soviet Medical Workers' Newspaper published an editorial on June 12, pointing out the importance of doctors treating patients with a responsible attitude, paying attention everywhere. The abstract is as follows:

    In the Soviet state, various measures have been implemented to cultivate a new type of doctor. However, the leaders of some health agencies, party organizations, and social groups have not paid due attention to the education of medical staff. This is particularly strongly evidenced by the fact that there are still instances of formalism in the actual work of individual doctors and medical institutions in treating patients. In some places, one can still encounter doctors who are like craftsmen and formalists, who do not understand the significance of treating patients sensitively with the correct medical attitude. When talking to patients, such doctors often show a cold and indifferent attitude. They forget that an important task of Soviet doctors is to encourage patients with the confidence to recover as soon as possible.

    The joint organizations of Soviet medical and preventive institutions are trying to solve an important task - to improve the medical level of the diagnosis and treatment departments with all their strength. It is regrettable that some doctors still rush when receiving patients, and patients do not have the opportunity to talk to them in detail. There is no doubt that such bad habits will reduce patients' trust in doctors.

    There are no and cannot be standards that determine the relationship between doctors and patients. But one thing is very clear: this relationship should be full of care, affection, concern, and a skilled, thoughtful attitude towards patients. If not, even the most effective treatment cannot produce the expected results.

    In some places, even such unacceptable situations occur: the doctor in charge of the operation sees the patient for the first time only a few minutes before the operation begins. This bad practice will cause psychological alertness in patients and cause them to have a natural fear of the good results of the operation.

    It is completely intolerable that some doctors underestimate the significance of language as a powerful stimulant. It is not only young doctors who make this mistake, but also some experienced doctors, especially when checking wards. Here, the issue is not about implementing whispers in each department or eliminating unnecessary sounds inside the hospital. Sometimes, a doctor's expression or a few medical terms accidentally spoken may cause the patient to be extremely nervous. It is now time for the heads of each department, the heads of medical institutions, and the doctors of each department to seriously consider their personal behavior in front of the bed, beside the operating table, in front of the X-ray machine, and in the diagnostic room.

    The huge and important responsibilities shouldered by doctors require the leaders of various health agencies to pay constant attention to the organization of doctors' work, such as doctors' workload, equipment in diagnostic rooms, and so on. In addition, it is also necessary to eliminate all trivial matters that distract him and reduce the quality of medical care during the doctor's working hours.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    电影剧本是重要的文学
    苏联“文学报”六月十二日社论，摘要如下：
    苏联的观众喜爱本国的电影艺术，他们以苏联的那些获得了世界荣誉的作品而自豪。我们的观众希望看到更多的苏联影片——各种体裁的，各种主题的影片。
    出产更多的影片需要什么呢？首先最需要的就是好的电影剧本。但是，在思想—艺术方面有充分价值的电影剧本太少，也就限制了新影片的出品，阻止了我们电影艺术的成长。
    改善电影剧本创作的情况、争取高度的艺术的技巧，就是现在这种最富有群众性的艺术赖以发展的重要条件。
    电影剧本也是像长篇小说、中篇小说和戏剧一样重要的文学。电影剧本应在鲜明的剧情的冲突中，在各种人物的突出的，各方面的性格中把深刻的生活问题、把当代的伟大思想表现出来。留心地研究实际情况、忠实于生活，就是使电影剧本创作获得成功的首要条件。
    我们常说，电影剧本是一种完善的文学作品。但是对于电影剧本创作的态度，在实践中间，却并不老是与这个正确的论点相符。有一些作家虽然也承认电影剧本是一种非常有价值的文学体裁，然而，他们并没有用他们写小说和剧本的那种精密性来写电影剧本。
    真正能够放入重要文学作品之列，成为独具风格的有特色的独立的文学作品的电影剧本，是写得太少了。
    把电影剧本看作是副产品的不正确的观点，也使我们的批评家们产生了轻视这种文学体裁的情况。
    苏联文学家的基本任务——就是反映现时生活，把苏联人民表现出来。但是电影剧作家们却更愿意抓过去的主题和什么传记来写电影剧本。
    也像在其他文学作品中一样，在人物活动中所表现出来的明确的、深刻的思想，应当是电影剧本的基础。这种思想应当引导电影剧本的活动和它的情节的发展。
    我们电影艺术的前进，首先要依靠电影剧作家的工作，电影剧本的质量。我们作家的任务——就是保证以重要的文学作品来供给电影业，尽力帮助苏联电影艺术的进一步发展。
    更勇敢地深入电影艺术的新领域中去
    “苏联艺术报”六月二十八日社论，摘要如下：
    在苏联，电影故事片现在已成为主要形式，传记片也牢固地被肯定下来，并且正在发展。新的体裁——记录片和科学片——还只是粗具规模，在这方面，电影工作者们还需要作创造性的努力。至于像喜剧、音乐片以及冒险片等重要体裁，近来却都没有得到应有的注意。
    斯大林同志说过：喜剧是苏联艺术的一种重要体裁，只要它不是讥嘲苏联人民而是负有教育观众的高贵任务的，只要它是爽朗的，散布着生活的快乐，有助于与人们意识中的资本主义残余作斗争的。缺乏这种喜剧的现象——是电影剧本创作的严重缺点。
    不能抱怨作家们没有注意传记体裁的和历史体裁的电影剧本。但是在这方面却表现出作者们使用现成的、证实了的手法的意图，而对于表现各种各样的丰富材料的新形式和新手法的寻求是不够的。科学故事影片已从我们的银幕上溜走，那些有着温柔的抒情诗风味的呼吸和从头到尾都响彻着辽阔愉快的人民音乐的影片早就看不见了。对于为儿童与青年制造的、应当具有独特风格的影片也很少注意。
    但是，引导艺术家们仅仅注意更勇敢地创造性地继续追寻体裁的发展也是不对的，深入电影的新领域中去——就是说，根据生活的要求，去寻找符合于新的生活内容的新的表现形式。
    在研究有关确定电影艺术的发展道路和各种体裁的特点的问题方面的重大任务，是属于我们理论家与批评家的。他们仍是落后于电影剧本创作的实际情况之后，没有大胆地广泛地去总结电影艺术的创造性的成绩。
    应当在银幕上来歌颂我们的光荣的过去、美丽的现在和奇异的、光辉的未来。银幕上应当像戏剧一样的动人和真挚，像抒情诗一样具有充分的斗争和美满的气氛。应当充满着人民的幽默，反映出步向伟大的目标——共产主义——的人民的美妙丰富的思想、感情和行动。应当把艺术家、理论家、批评家的创造性的胆量引向创作这样的作品。
    医生与病人
    苏联医务工作者报六月十二日发表社论，指出医生以
    处处留神的负责态度对待病人的重要，摘要如下：
    在苏维埃国家中，已经实施了培育新型医生的各种办法。但是某些卫生机关的领导者、党组织和社会团体，对于医生干部的教育工作，却没有给予应有的注意。在一些个别的医生和医疗机关的实际工作中，仍然存在着的以形式主义态度对待病人的事实，特别有力地证明了这一点。有些地方还可以遇到这样的医生，他们颇像手艺匠和形式主义者，没有懂得以正确的医疗态度敏感地来对待病人的意义。这样的医生在和病人谈话时，往往显露出冷淡和漠不关心的样子，他们忘记了苏联医生的一个重要任务就是要用尽快获得痊愈的信心来鼓励病人。
    苏联的医疗、预防机关的联合组织，正在设法解决一项重要任务——全力改善诊疗部门的医务水平。令人遗憾的是仍有些医生接待病人时匆匆忙忙，病人得不到向他们详细谈话的机会。毫无疑问，这类恶劣作风是会使病人对医生的信任降低的。
    没有也不可能有确定医生和病人的关系的标准。但是有一点却十分明显：这种关系应当充满着对病人的体贴、亲爱、关切和熟练的、考虑周密的态度。如果不是这样，那么即使最有效的治疗也不能产生预期的结果。
    有的地方甚至还出现着这类不能容许的情况：负责手术的医生刚在手术开始前的几分钟才第一次看到病人。这种恶劣的作法，将在病人心理上引起警惕，并使他们对手术的良好结果发生一种自然的恐惧。
    完全不能容忍的是有些医生对于语言这一有力的刺激素的意义估计不足。犯这种缺点的不仅是青年医生，而且还有一些有经验的医生，特别是在查病房的时候。在这里，问题并不在于要在各科中实行低声耳语或消除医院内部的多余的声响而已。有时候，医生的一个表情，或偶然无意中说出的几个医学术语便可能使病人极度紧张。现在已经是使各科主任、医疗机关负责人和各科医生郑重考虑他们在病床前、在手术枱旁、在爱克司光仪器前和在诊断室中个人举止问题的时候了。
    医生所担负的巨大和重要的职责，要求各卫生机关的领导者对于医生的劳动的组织问题如医生的工作负担，诊断室的设备和其他等等，给予经常的注意。此外在医生工作的时间中，消除一切使他分神的和降低医疗质量的琐事也是很必要的。
