    Resolution on Opposing the Remilitarization of Japan and Fighting for a Democratic Japan
    The San Francisco Treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, signed under pressure from the United States, have provoked resolute resistance from the Japanese people in the two months since they came into effect on April 28, 1952. They believe that these two treaties were imposed on them at the expense of their vital interests and in disregard of their desire for peaceful development.
    Millions of men and women around the world are supporting the Japanese people in opposing these two treaties and the administrative agreements that go with them, because these treaties not only threaten the peaceful development of the Japanese people, the United States, and the people of the Pacific countries, but also threaten the peaceful development of people elsewhere in the world.
    The development of the situation confirms the views put forward in the resolution of the World Peace Council's Vienna meeting (November 1 to 7, 1951). The rapid expansion of Japan's armaments, the continued presence of U.S. occupation forces, and the maintenance of many military bases on Japanese territory, the so-called peace treaty signed between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet government, coupled with U.S. support for aggressive blocs in other parts of Asia—all this only further illustrates that Japan is being used as a base for aggression.
    In view of the threat of war expanding in Asia, the World Peace Council believes that the San Francisco Treaty and the agreements that followed it are illegal because they do not respect international agreements; a genuine treaty must be signed separately by all the countries concerned.
    This treaty should stipulate:
    (A) The withdrawal of all occupation forces from Japan, and no foreign military bases should be established in Japan.
    (B) The Japanese people have full sovereignty and need to develop in a democratic and peaceful atmosphere.
    The World Peace Council hails the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for peace, independence, and democracy, and against militarism and the forces of war; and calls on the people of all other countries in Asia and the Pacific to do their utmost to support this struggle. In this way, they can achieve their own peaceful and democratic development. The World Peace Council calls on peace-loving people and all countries whose governments signed the San Francisco Treaty to fight for a separate genuine peace treaty.
    To this end, the World Peace Council calls on the people of Asia and the Pacific to do everything possible to mobilize the forces of peace and democracy for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in the autumn of 1952. This conference will certainly help to satisfactorily resolve the problems facing Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

    关于反对日本重新军国主义化、为民主的日本而斗争的决议
    在美国的压力之下签订的旧金山条约和日美安全条约，在一九五二年四月二十八日生效以后的两个月中引起了日本人民坚决的反抗，他们认为：这两个条约是人们损害他们的切身利益，不顾他们向往和平发展的愿望而强加在他们身上的。
    全世界各地千百万男女都在支持日本人民反对这两个条约以及随之而来的行政协定，因为这些条约不仅威胁着日本人民以及美国和太平洋各国人民的和平发展，而且也威胁着世界上其他地方的人民的和平发展。
    形势的发展证实了世界和平理事会维也纳会议
    （一九五一年十一月一日到七日）的决议中所提出的观点。日本军备的迅速扩充，美国占领军的继续留驻以及在日本领土上保存许多军事基地，日本与蒋介石傀儡政府签订的所谓和约，再加上美国对亚洲其他地区侵略集团的支持——这一切只是更加说明了日本被利用作一个侵略基地。
    鉴于战争在亚洲扩大的威胁，世界和平理事会认为：旧金山条约和随之而来的协定是非法的，因为它们没有尊重国际协定；必须另行签订一个由所有有关国家签字的真正的条约。
    这个条约应该规定：
    （甲）一切占领军撤离日本，外国不得在日本建立军事基地。
    （乙）日本人民有充分的主权，他们需要在民主、和平的气氛中发展。
    世界和平理事会为日本人民争取和平、独立与民主、反对军国主义和战争势力的英勇斗争而欢呼；并号召亚洲和太平洋所有其他各国人民尽最大的力量支持这个斗争。这样，他们就可得到他们自己的和平、民主的发展。世界和平理事会号召爱好和平的人民，号召那些政府曾在旧金山条约上签了字的一切国家为另行签订一个真正的和约而斗争。
    为了达到这个目的，世界和平理事会号召亚洲和太平洋各国人民竭尽一切力量，为召开将于一九五二年秋季在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，而把和平民主力量动员起来。这个会议对于圆满地解决日本以及亚洲太平洋其他各国所面临的问题是一定会有帮助的。
