    Introduction to the "Today's Poland" Photo Exhibition
    By our reporter Tan Wenrui
    To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic, the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government is holding a "Today's Poland" photo exhibition to introduce the current situation of the Polish Republic's economic and cultural construction, so that we can have a better understanding of our brother country through realistic pictures.
    The content of the pictures includes industrial construction, agricultural production, culture and education, and people's lives; the overall impression they give is that since the Polish people were liberated from the oppression of foreign occupiers and domestic reactionaries, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of various people's democratic countries, they have not only recovered from the wounds of war, but are also victoriously building socialism.
    Poland was one of the countries in Europe that suffered the most damage during World War II. Due to the destructive massacre and destruction by the Hitler bandits, Poland lost more than six million people and suffered huge material losses. After liberation, the Polish people established their own people's regime and carried out the work of restoring and developing the national economy on the devastated ruins. After they successfully completed the Three-Year Plan for economic recovery with diligent and selfless labor, they began to implement the Six-Year Plan to lay the foundation for socialism. The Polish people have not only restored their industry, but are also striving to build a prosperous and happy socialist country. We can see from the pictures that workers in various departments are actively engaged in production, and countless outstanding labor models have emerged. In April of this year, to celebrate President Bierut's sixtieth birthday and welcome May Day, the workers accepted new production tasks and launched labor competitions, and their labor efficiency is increasing day by day. Many new industrial sectors have been established. Pre-war Poland did not produce cars, but now the Jelcz automobile factory has produced batches of beautiful sedans; two other automobile factories are producing trucks. By 1955, the output of cars will reach 12,000, and the output of trucks will reach 25,000. Pre-war Poland could not produce man-made fibers, and the pictures show that the Wrocław man-made fiber factory is expanding its site. The industrial equipment of various departments is being expanded on a large scale, and the construction project of the Silesian industrial zone is being actively carried out. The new industrial city of Nowa Huta, with a large metallurgical factory, will soon be completed. In addition, we can see many other new factories being built, installing machines. After the Six-Year Plan, Poland will build 350 large factories and enterprises. The increase in means of production guarantees the improvement of productivity. The rate of increase in Poland's industrial production has far exceeded the provisions of the Six-Year Plan. By 1955, Poland's industrial production level (calculated by population ratio) will be four times higher than in 1938.
    The rapid development of industry provides conditions for agricultural mechanization. Poland completed land reform in 1948, and farmers are using new agricultural implements and agricultural machinery to cultivate their land. The number of collective farms is increasing, and by 1955, 5,000 state-owned farms will be established on state-owned land. The improvement of farming techniques and the development of socialist components have continuously increased agricultural production. By 1955, the agricultural production level will increase to 219 percent (with 1938 as 100).
    Reconstruction and construction projects are underway throughout the country. The reconstruction of Warsaw is a typical example. When Warsaw was first liberated, it was almost a ruin of rubble. At that time, some British and American "observers" believed that it was impossible to rebuild Warsaw, and Poland might as well find another place as its capital. However, the perseverance and efforts of the Polish people overcame all difficulties. After eight years, the new city of Warsaw was built on the ruins. From a photo of a rebuilt street in Warsaw, we can no longer see the traces of war. The Polish people are continuing their construction plans, and construction workers are using the latest machinery to carry out construction projects. We can see in the pictures that steel-bone cement buildings under construction are lined up densely. Warsaw will not only become an important industrial center, but will also be built into a magnificent capital of a socialist country.
    The culture and living welfare of the Polish people are improving day by day. Beautiful workers' residences are being built everywhere, and the lives of the workers are constantly improving. Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed rapidly. Well-equipped nurseries have been established everywhere to help women raise children, so that they can participate in production and other work with peace of mind. From kindergartens to advanced schools, the doors have been opened to children of workers and peasants. Before the war, one million school-age children in Poland were out of school, but now all school-age children can go to school. This year, 379,000 primary school students graduated, an increase of 40,000 from last year. We can see that students at all levels of schools are living a happy learning life in beautiful school buildings. Cultural, recreational and sports activities have also been greatly developed. The luxurious residences of the landlords have now been transformed into cultural palaces for the working people, and various art troupes perform for the working people during festivals. Cultural and artistic workers participate in cultural construction work with great enthusiasm. We can see how famous artists carefully repair historical relics and create monuments and sculptures for new buildings. This is how the Polish people are working hard for their bright future.
    The newborn Polish People's Republic is striding forward on the road to socialism. (Attached picture)

    “今日的波兰”图片展览介绍
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    为了庆祝波兰人民共和国成立八周年，我中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局特举办了一个“今日的波兰”图片展览，介绍波兰共和国经济、文化建设各方面的近况，使我们通过逼真的图片对我们的兄弟国家有更多的了解。
    图片的内容包括工业建设、农业生产、文化教育、人民生活等方面；它们给人的总的印象是：波兰人民从外国占领者及国内反动派的压迫下获得解放以来，在苏联的援助和各人民民主国家的合作下，不仅已恢复了战争的创伤，而且正胜利地建设着社会主义。
    波兰是欧洲在第二次世界大战中遭受损害最重的国家之一，由于希特勒匪徒进行了毁灭性的屠杀和破坏，波兰丧失了六百万以上的人民，还受到了巨大的物质损失。解放以后，波兰人民建立了人民自己的政权，在残破的废墟上进行了恢复和发展国家经济的工作。他们以勤奋忘我的劳动胜利地完成了经济复兴三年计划之后，并开始实行奠定社会主义基础的六年计划。波兰人民不仅恢复了他们的工业，而且正为建立一个富强和幸福的社会主义国家而奋斗。我们从图片中可以看到各个部门的工人们都在积极进行生产，涌现了无数的优秀的劳动模范。今年四月，为了庆祝贝鲁特总统六十寿辰和迎接五一劳动节，工人们接受了新的生产任务并展开劳动竞赛，他们的劳动效率一天天在提高。许多新的工业部门已经设立起来。战前波兰是不生产汽车的，现在热兰的汽车厂已制造出一批批漂亮的轿车；另外两个汽车制造厂则在生产载重卡车。到一九五五年，汽车的产量将达一万二千辆，卡车的产量将达二万五千辆。战前波兰是不能生产人造纤维的，图片显示着罗克劳的人造纤维厂正在扩充厂址。各个部门的工业装备都在大规模扩充，西里西亚工业区的建设工程正在积极进行，拥有一个庞大冶金工厂的新工业城市诺伐·胡塔即将建筑完成。另外，我们可以看到其他许多新的工厂在建筑厂址，安装机器，经过六年计划，波兰将建设起三百五十个大工厂企业。生产资料的增加保证了生产力的提高，波兰工业生产量增加的速度已远超过六年计划的规定，到一九五五年，波兰的工业生产水平（以人口比例计算）将比一九三八年提高四倍。
    工业的迅速发展提供了农业机械化的条件。波兰在一九四八年完成了土地改革，农民在自己的土地上使用着新式农具和农业机器进行耕作。集体农庄的数目在增加，到一九五五年就将有五千个国营农场在国有的土地上建立起来。耕作技术的提高和社会主义成分的发展，使农业生产量不断增加。到一九五五年，农业生产水平将提高到百分之二百一十九（以一九三八年为一○○）。
    全国各地都在进行着复兴和建设工程。华沙的重建是一个典型的例子。华沙在刚解放的时候，几乎是一座遍地瓦砾的废墟，当时一些英美“观察家”认为重建华沙是不可能的，波兰不如另找一个地方作首都。但是波兰人民的坚毅与努力战胜了一切困难，经过八个年头，新的华沙城在废墟上建设起来了。从一帧华沙一条重建的街道的照片上，我们已看不到战争的痕迹。波兰人民正在继续他们的建设计划，建筑工人采用着最新式的机械来进行建筑工程，我们从图片中看到在建筑中的钢骨水泥的大厦鳞次栉比。华沙不仅将成为一个重要的工业中心，而且将被建设成一个壮丽的社会主义国家的首都。
    波兰人民的文化和生活福利日益提高，各地都在建筑漂亮的工人住宅，工人们的生活不断得到改善。文化与教育事业同样迅速地发展起来。各地普遍设立了设备完善的托儿所，帮助妇女抚育儿童，使她们可以安心参加生产和其他工作。从幼儿园到高级学校都为工农子弟打开了大门。战前波兰有一百万学龄儿童失学，现在全部学龄儿童都能入学了。今年有三十七万九千名小学生毕业，比去年增加了四万名。我们可以看到各级学校的学生们在精美的校舍中过着愉快的学习生活。文娱和体育活动也大大发展，地主的华丽住宅现在改成了劳动人民的文化宫，各种文工团每逢节日便为劳动人民表演。文化艺术工作者以高度的热情参加文化建设工作，我们可以看到著名的艺术家如何细心地在修理历史文物以及为新建筑创作纪念物和雕刻品。波兰人民就是这样为了自己美好的将来而勤劳地工作着。
    新生的波兰人民共和国正向着社会主义的道路大步迈进。（附图片）
