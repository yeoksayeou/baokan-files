    Patriotic Health Campaign in Nancun, Shihugou, Kuandian County, Liaodong

    Leaving the east gate of Kuandian Town and heading east for about three miles, on the right side of the highway leading to Ji'an County, nestled among the green trees are scattered courtyards. This is Nancun, Shihugou, District One, Kuandian County, an advanced village in the patriotic health campaign in Kuandian County.
    The farmers in this village are now busily engaged in hoeing and weeding. The robust seedlings reflect the sunshine of June, showing a lush green color. The farmers are exceptionally happy to see the signs of a bountiful harvest. In the evening, they sing songs as they return to their clean homes, which they have cleaned themselves, feeling even more cheerful and refreshed.
    I arrived at Nancun, Shihugou on June 23rd. That day, I visited more than a dozen farm households in Groups 2 and 8 with the village chief, Yu Haiqing. The deep impression they gave me was: every household is very clean.
    No matter the streets or courtyards of any compound, they are swept very clean. The pits in the yards have been filled, and every household has built new toilets with lids, which are kept very clean. Next to each livestock pen, pigsty, and chicken/duck coop, there is a pile of soil for bedding to keep the pens clean at all times. In Li Shouxian's house in Group 2, the chicken coop even had a pile of fine soil prepared for the chicks to take "dust baths," and the chickens' feeding utensils and laying nests were well prepared.
    People pay great attention to the hygiene of drinking water. The well platforms for water wells in each courtyard are more than a foot above the ground and are lined with wooden frames, and are equipped with well covers and public water buckets; some well covers are even locked, and water is drawn at fixed times in the morning, evening, and at noon; some well platforms are also equipped with frames for resting carrying poles to keep the poles clean.
    It is almost impossible to see a single vegetable leaf on the well platform. Drinking cattle and washing clothes on the well platform are now considered the most immoral things to do.
    To prevent flies and insects, many families have installed screen windows, and the floors of their houses are swept very clean. The walls inside the house are smoothly plastered with lime and fine yellow mud, and the dust on the roof beams and pillars has also been cleaned. Wang Naichun's family in Group 2 planed the shed boards and shed poles flat; the bowls, chopsticks, rice bowls, vegetable cutting boards and other utensils are stored in a large cupboard, and the cupboard door is covered with clean white cloth; the water tank and rice pot have lids; and the water ladle rests on the pot lid. As for the bottles, clocks and other daily utensils, they are placed in a very orderly manner. Wang Naichun's wife said: "We scald the bowls every two or three days, wash our clothes frequently, and pay attention to hygiene in all aspects to eliminate the American imperialist's germ warfare!"
    They have come up with many economical ways to make fly swatters out of tin scraps, broken rubber shoe soles, broken iron wires, and gong bottoms. Gong Lide's family of four in Group 8 has four fly swatters, one for each person, and they chase after flies and swat them to death. They put the dead flies in a small bottle and then burn them.
    The hollows in the old trees in front and behind the houses in each courtyard, and other places where dirt can easily accumulate, have been filled with yellow mud.
    Since the land reform, the peasants in Nancun, Shihugou have developed production, improved their living standards, and urgently demanded to improve their health work. With the leadership of the people's government, some achievements have been made in health work. But this is the first time that it has been so thorough and in-depth.
    At first, some farmers said, "Those few flies don't matter!" Some said, "If we pay attention to hygiene, we won't have time to farm!" They did not realize the relationship between hygiene and production, and the importance of hygiene to ensuring production. Village cadres, party members, Youth League members, and propagandists focused on these ideological situations and carried out extensive publicity and education work, explaining that doing a good job in environmental sanitation can not only ensure personal health, but also ensure increased production. Wang Xueyi, secretary of the CPC village branch, used facts to expose to the masses the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare, and called on the villagers to carry out environmental sanitation campaigns to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases and ensure production. At the same time, village cadres also organized the masses to visit good examples of environmental sanitation to increase the masses' confidence in doing a good job in environmental sanitation. Thus, a mass environmental sanitation campaign was launched.
    In late May, the first, second, and other four groups held meetings to formulate patriotic health covenants, which clearly stipulated that the interior should always maintain four cleanlinesses (that is, the walls, kangs, floors, and shelves should always be kept clean and dust-free), water tanks should be scrubbed once a day, bowls and chopsticks should be scalded once every three days, food should be placed in cupboards and covered with gauze; outdoor sanitation should ensure that the yards and streets are swept regularly, toilets, pigsties, chicken coops, and livestock pens are covered with soil once a day, the warehouses and corn cribs are cleaned, and efforts are made to kill rats. In terms of personal hygiene, wash your face and brush your teeth every day, wash your feet every night, wash your hands before meals and rinse your mouth after meals, do not eat cold raw food, ensure you drink boiled water, have your head shaved and face shaved once a month, men and women, young and old, take a bath, and carry out a five-eradication campaign to eliminate rats, flies, mosquitoes, lice, and fleas.
    At the same time, a mass health team was established in the village, and health groups were also established in each administrative group. According to the number of households and courtyards, every three or four families or five or six families were divided into a health group, and a health group leader was elected to implement a daily rotating inspection system. Each group also elected model health households, and every Saturday was designated as a day for major sanitation cleanups. Hygiene classes were also added to the farmers' spare-time schools to ensure that hygiene work is always done well.
    These days, Li Shoude's wife from Group 2 went to her mother's house, and Hong Lanzi, who is eleven years old, is at home. Like her mother, she cleans the yard and the room every day, sweeping the floor several times a day. Someone asked, "Why are you working so hard?" Hong Lanzi said, "The American devils spread flies and poisonous insects to poison our people. We cannot have the slightest complacency and must always do a good job in sanitation!"
    One day, the lid of the drinking water well in Wang Fenglin's courtyard in Group 2 fell into the well. Auntie Yu, who was in charge of watching the well, asked around and investigated the responsibility. Later, she learned that Qu Shenglin's child had knocked it down while playing by the well, so she reported it to the village chief, and Qu's family was criticized at the administrative group meeting. Qu Shenglin said that he would teach his child well in the future and not let him go to the well.
    Everyone consciously abides by the patriotic health covenant. The first and second administrative groups held a meeting on the evening of June 24 to elect model health households. Although the Jiang family in Group 1 had few people, they were able to combine production with environmental sanitation and were also selected as a model.

    辽东宽甸县石湖沟南村的爱国卫生运动
    沙星
    走出宽甸镇东门东行三里许，在通往辑安县公路的右侧，绿树丛中散布着一个个院落。这是宽甸县一区石湖沟南村，是宽甸县爱国卫生运动中先进的一个村庄。
    这村农民现在正紧张地进行铲趟。茁壮的小苗映射着六月的阳光，现出一片油青的色彩。农民们看到预兆丰收的情景，心里真是分外高兴。在晚上，他们唱着歌回到自己一手打扫得清洁干净的住屋里，心里更感到愉快清爽。
    六月二十三日我来到了石湖沟南村。这天，我随村长于海清参观了二组、八组的十几家农户，它们给我的深刻的印象是：家家户户都很清洁。
    不论那个院落的街道和庭院，都扫得非常干净。院子里的院坑都填平了，家家都新建了带盖子的厕所，保持得非常清洁。每家的牲口圈、猪圈、鸡鸭圈、便所的旁边都放着一堆随时垫圈用的泥土，保持牲口圈的经常清洁卫生。二组李守贤家的鸡圈还给小鸡准备了一堆细土好打“抱”，鸡的饮食器具和下蛋的窝都准备得很齐全。
    人们都很注意饮水的卫生，每个院落的用水井，井台高出地面一尺多，并镶上了木框，还备有井盖、公共打水桶；有的水井盖上还上了锁，每天早晚和晌午定时打水；有的井台上还安上了停放挑水扁担的架子，保持扁担的清洁干净。
    在井台上几乎看不到一片菜叶子，在井台上饮牛和洗衣服，已经被认为最不道德的事情了。
    为了防蝇防虫，很多人家都安上了纱窗子，屋地打扫得很洁净。屋内墙壁用石灰和细黄泥刷得溜光，房梁屋柱上的灰尘也都打扫了。二组王乃春家用刨把棚板和棚杆子推平了；饭碗、筷子、饭盆、菜墩子等用具都装在一个大碗柜里，柜门挂着洁白的冷布；水缸、饭锅都有盖；水瓢叩在锅盖上。至于瓶子、座钟等日常用具都很有顺序地摆放着。王乃春老婆说：“我们每隔两三天就烫一次碗，衣裳常洗常换，各方面都要好好地讲卫生，扑灭美帝国主义的细菌战！”
    他们想出了很多节约的办法，用洋铁片子、破胶皮鞋底、破铁丝、锣底制造捕苍蝇的拍子。八组宫利德家四口人有四个苍蝇拍子，每人一个，发现苍蝇就追着把它扑灭。他们把打死的苍蝇装在一个小瓶子里，然后用火烧掉。
    各个院落房前屋后的古老树木上的空洞，和其他容易藏垢纳污的地方都用黄泥塞上了。
    石湖沟南村农民从土地改革以来发展了生产，生活改善了，也迫切要求搞好卫生工作，再加人民政府的领导，卫生工作也做出一些成绩。可是像这样深入彻底，还是第一次。
    起先，也有的农民说：“那几个苍蝇算不了什么！”有的说：“讲卫生就不用种地了！”没有认识到卫生和生产的关系，卫生对保证生产的重要性。村干部、党员、青年团员、宣传员就针对着这些思想情况，用实际例子，展开了广泛的宣传教育工作，说明搞好了环境卫生工作，不仅可以保证个人的身体健康，也可以保证增加生产。中共村支部书记王学义，用事实向群众揭发了美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，号召村民开展环境卫生运动，防止传染病的发生，保证生产。同时，村干部还组织群众参观环境卫生的好样子，提高群众搞好环境卫生的信心。于是一个群众性的环境卫生运动便开展起来了。
    五月下旬，第一组、第二组等四个组都开会订立了爱国卫生公约，明确规定了室内经常保持四光
    （即墙、炕、地、棚经常保持干净无灰尘），水缸每天刷洗一次，碗筷每三天烫一次，食物都要放在橱柜里，和用纱布罩上；室外卫生要做到常扫院子街道，便所、猪圈、鸡架、牲口圈一天垫一次土，把仓房和苞米仓附近打扫干净，设法捕灭老鼠。个人卫生方面，每日都要洗脸刷牙，每天晚上洗一次脚，饭前洗手饭后漱口，不吃生冷东西，保证喝开水，每月剃一次头，刮一次脸，男女老少都洗一次澡，开展灭鼠、灭蝇、灭蚊、灭虱、灭蚤的五灭运动。
    同时，全村成立了群众卫生队，每个行政组也成立了卫生小组，按住户院落，每三、四家或五、六家划分为一个卫生小组，选出卫生小组长，实行值日轮流检查制度。各组又选举了卫生模范户，每星期六为卫生大清扫日。农民业余学校里也增添了卫生课，保证经常搞好卫生工作。
    这几天二组李守德的老婆住娘家去了，十一岁的洪兰子在家，她也和她妈一样天天打扫院子和室内，一天扫好几遍地。有人问：“你怎干的这样起劲呢？”洪兰子说：“美国鬼子撒下苍蝇毒虫，要毒害咱们老百姓，我们不能有一点麻痹思想，必须经常搞好卫生！”
    一天，二组王凤林院落饮水井的盖子掉到井里边去了，负责看井的于老大娘到处寻问，追查责任，后来她知道是曲盛林的孩子在井边玩时把它弄掉下去的，便向村长报告了，在行政小组会上批评了曲家，曲盛林表示以后要好好教管孩子，不让他到井边去。
    大家都自觉地遵守爱国卫生公约。第一、第二行政组在六月二十四日晚上开会选出了卫生模范户。一组的姜家人手虽少，但能结合生产搞好环境卫生工作，也被选为模范。
