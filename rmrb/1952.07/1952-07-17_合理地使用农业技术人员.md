    Reasonable Use of Agricultural Technicians

    Editor: We have learned that many agricultural school graduates are being used unreasonably. For example, in the Agricultural Cooperative Bank (now the Agricultural Finance Bureau of the People's Bank of China) and the People's Insurance Company of China, many agricultural technicians are doing work unrelated to their field. However, farms, veterinary epidemic prevention stations, and other units in various regions urgently need this type of talent but cannot find it. This is a great loss to the country's economic construction. We suggest to the Central Personnel Department and agricultural authorities that these agricultural technicians be reasonably transferred.

    合理地使用农业技术人员
    编辑同志：据我们知道的，农业学校毕业的有不少的人是被不合理使用着。如在农业合作银行（现为中国人民银行农业金融管理局）和中国人民保险公司，都有不少的农业技术人员做着非本行的工作。可是各地农场、兽疫防治站等单位却迫切需要这类人材而无处觅得。这对祖国的经济建设是一个很大的损失。我们向中央人事部和农业主管部门建议：把这批农业技术人员作合理调动。
