    Beijing Second District Cadres Strengthen Current Affairs Study

    Editor,
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published on April 26th included a letter criticizing some cadres in Beijing's districts for neglecting reading newspapers and studying. It also suggested that Party organizations at all levels in Beijing actively lead cadres in reading newspapers. This suggestion is very important. At the beginning of June, we conducted an inspection of cadres in district-level agencies and found that the situation of many cadres neglecting reading newspapers and studying was very serious. In nine units, including the District People's Government and the People's Bank Office, more than 20% of the people rarely read newspapers or did not read them at all, and more than 58% of the people read newspapers very carelessly. The leading cadres of some units also rarely read newspapers. Individual Party branch leaders never read newspapers, and did not even participate in the test notified by the District Committee.

    Due to the neglect of current affairs study, the general cadres lack the necessary understanding of important current affairs issues. Recently, we conducted a current affairs test for all cadres in the district. 416 people participated in the test, and more than 80% failed. Some cadres who personally participated in the "Five-Anti" campaign did not even understand the principles for dealing with illegal industrialists and merchants. Some people described the significance of the International Economic Conference as "developing the New Democratic economy." Some did not know who the world's four great cultural figures were. Among the 143 cadres working in banks who participated in the test, only 10 knew that the Soviet Union had issued bonds.

    In order to change the phenomenon of some cadres neglecting current affairs political study, we have taken the following measures: First, we have instructed all subordinate branches to strengthen the leadership of reading newspapers and studying for staff in agencies; requiring administrative leaders at all levels to pay attention to staff's current affairs study and provide necessary study materials; absorb mass opinions and come up with ways to improve current affairs study. Second, the branches of each agency should closely combine reading newspapers with the Party's propaganda network work. Party propagandists should strengthen current affairs propaganda; for cadres with low cultural levels, the tutoring of current affairs study should be strengthened. Third, the Party's reporters should give a current affairs report to all staff in the district once every one or two months; test once a month. Regularly check the staff's reading of newspapers and study, promptly commend units or individuals who study well, and criticize the erroneous tendency to neglect politics.

### 北京二区干部加强时事学习

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京二区干部加强时事学习
    编辑同志：四月二十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了批评北京市某些区干部忽视读报学习的来信，同时建议北京市各级党的组织积极领导干部读报工作。这个意见是非常重要的。六月初我们对区级各机关干部作了一次检查，发现许多干部忽视读报学习的情况十分严重。区人民政府、人民银行办事处等九个单位有百分之二十以上的人很少看报或根本不看报，百分之五十八以上的人，读报十分马虎。若干单位的领导干部也很少看报。个别党支部负责人平时根本不看报，区委通知测验时，他也不参加。
    由于忽视时事学习，一般干部对当前的重要时事问题都缺乏应有的认识。最近我们对全区干部进行了一次时事测验，参加测验的有四百一十六人，不及格的在百分之八十以上。有些亲身参加“五反”工作的干部，竟不了解对违法工商户的处理原则。有的人把国际经济会议的意义说成是“发展新民主主义经济”。有些不知道世界四大文化名人是谁。参加测验的一百四十三名做银行工作的干部中，只有十人知道苏联曾发行过公债。
    为了改变某些干部忽视时事政治学习的现象，我们采取了以下几种措施：一、我们已指示所属各支部，加强机关工作人员读报学习的领导；要求各级行政领导干部重视工作人员的时事学习，供给必要的学习资料；吸收群众意见，想出改进时事学习的办法。二、各机关支部应该把读报工作和党的宣传网工作密切结合起来。党的宣传员应该加强时事宣传；对于文化水平低的干部的时事学习，应该加强辅导工作。三、每一、二月党的报告员向全区工作人员作一次时事报告；每月测验一次。经常检查工作人员的读报学习，及时表扬学习好的单位或个人，批评忽视政治的错误倾向。
