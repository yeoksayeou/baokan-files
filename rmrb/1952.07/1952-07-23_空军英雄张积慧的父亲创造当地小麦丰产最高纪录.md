    Air Force Hero Zhang Jihui's Father Creates Local Wheat Yield Record
    Editor: Zhang Benzhou is the father of Zhang Jihui, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force. This year, he adopted methods such as improving the soil, selecting good seeds, sinking wells for irrigation, applying fertilizer reasonably, and cultivating meticulously. His eight mu of wheat achieved a bumper harvest, averaging 476 jin per mu, an increase of 112 jin compared to his wheat yield last year, and 196 jin more than the local masses' wheat yield, creating the highest wheat yield record in the area.
    Zhang Benzhou's wheat has tall and thick stalks, and the grains are full and white. He said that this is the best harvest he has ever seen in his life. He said that he obtained this good harvest entirely because he listened to Chairman Mao's words, organized himself, and cultivated meticulously. He said that although his wheat had a bumper harvest, there were still shortcomings in production. He said: "Our mutual aid team has not yet reached the stage of keeping accounts and calculating scores. I am the leader of the mutual aid team, and I am determined to improve it further and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in all kinds of production this year." He also said: "My son is an Air Force hero, and my wheat has also had a bumper harvest. It's a double celebration, and this is the happiest thing in my life. This is the glory of Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country, and I am also honored. I want to compete with my son; he can eliminate American devils and show heroism on the Korean front, and I can also work hard with a hoe and strive to be a model on the production front (he is now a labor model in the district). I am determined to achieve a full harvest in this year's patriotic production increase movement so that I can see Chairman Mao."

    空军英雄张积慧的父亲创造当地小麦丰产最高纪录
    编辑同志：张本周老大爷是中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧的父亲。他今年采用了改良土壤、选用良种、打井灌溉、合理施肥、精耕细作等办法，他的八亩小麦获得丰收，平均每亩产麦四百七十六斤，比他去年的小麦增产一百十二斤，比当地群众的小麦增产一百九十六斤，创造了当地小麦丰产的最高纪录。
    张本周老大爷的小麦，麦秸长得又高又粗，麦粒饱满发白。他说，这是有生以来从没有见过的好收成。他说，他获得这个好收成，完全是听了毛主席的话，组织起来、精耕细作的缘故。他说，他的小麦虽然丰收了，但在生产上还有不够的地方。他说：“我参加的互助组，还没有作到记分算账。我是互助组长，我下决心要把它提高一步，争取今年各种生产全面丰收。”又说：“我儿子是空军英雄，我的小麦又得到丰收，双喜临门，这是我有生以来最高兴的事情。这是毛主席和全国人民的光荣，我也跟着光荣。我要和我儿子竞竞赛，他能在朝鲜前线消灭美国鬼子逞英雄，我也能用锄头加劲干，在生产战线上争模范（现他已是区的劳动模范）。我有决心在今年爱国增产运动里得到全年丰收，我好去见毛主席。”于彬斋  鞠庆茂
