Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 19th. On July 1st, Chief Representative General Nam Il of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks presented the names of 203 of our captured personnel who were not included in the list of prisoners of war submitted by the other side on December 18th of last year, demanding that the other side account for the whereabouts of these personnel. On July 8th, Chief Representative Major General Harrison of the other side replied, requesting our side to provide the "prisoner of war camp detention numbers" of these captured personnel of our side. On July 19th, General Nam Il pointed out in a reply letter that the "detention number" was the number assigned by the other side to our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camp. The other side cannot refuse to give a responsible account of the whereabouts of our captured personnel by demanding that our side provide the "detention numbers" in the other side's prisoner of war camp as a condition. General Nam Il requested the other side to continue to inquire about the situation of the 203 captured personnel of our side and inform our side of the results. The full text of General Nam Il's reply is as follows:

"To Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of July 8th requesting our side to provide the 'detention numbers' of the 203 captured personnel of our side that we are inquiring about has been received. The 'detention number' is the number assigned by your side to our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camp. Unless your side publicly discloses the 'detention numbers' of these captured personnel of our side, we have no way of knowing. Now, we provide you with the 'detention numbers' of three captured personnel of our side that we know of: Liu Nanping 701,204, Chen Senyun 720,193, Wu Jiansheng 701,295. It must be pointed out that our side providing the 'detention numbers' of the captured personnel of our side that we know of is only for your reference in the inquiry. You still have the responsibility to give a responsible account of the situation of the other 200 captured personnel of our side whose 'detention numbers' we have no way of knowing. I request that you continue to inquire about their situation and inform our side of the results.

Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation
Chief Representative General Nam Il
July 19, 1952"

On the 19th, an administrative meeting of the delegations of both sides continued to be held to discuss the repatriation of prisoners of war.

    美方制造藉口拒不交代我二百零三名战俘下落
    我方复函据理驳斥要求对方作负责交代
    【新华社开城十九日电】七月一日朝鲜停战谈判代表团我方首席代表南日将军，向对方提出未列入对方在去年十二月十八日交来的战俘名单中的二百零三名我方被俘人员的姓名，要求对方交代这些人员的下落。七月八日对方首席代表哈利逊少将复函，要求我方提供这些我方被俘人员的“战俘营拘留编号”。七月十九日南日将军在复信中指出，“拘留编号”是对方在战俘营中对我方被俘人员所编的号码。对方不能以要求我方提出对方战俘营中的“拘留编号”为条件，拒绝对我方被俘人员的下落作负责的交代。南日将军要求对方继续查询二百零三名我方被俘人员的情况，并将结果告知我方。南日将军复信全文如下：
    “联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    你于七月八日要求我方提供我方所查询的二百零三名我方被俘人员的‘拘留编号’的来信已经收到。按‘拘留编号’系你方在战俘营中对我方被俘人员所编的号码。除非你方公开披露这些我方被俘人员的‘拘留编号’，我方无从知悉。现将我方所知悉的三名我方被俘人员的‘拘留编号’提供给你方：刘南屏701，204，陈森云720，193，吴建生701，295。必须指出：我方提供已知悉的我方被俘人员的‘拘留编号’，只是为了你方在查询中的参考。对我方无从知悉‘拘留编号’的其他二百名我方被俘人员的情况，你方仍有责任作负责的交代。我要求你方继续查询他们的情况，并将结果告知我方。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
    首席代表南日将军
