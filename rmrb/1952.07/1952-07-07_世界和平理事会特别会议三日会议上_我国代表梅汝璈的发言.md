Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 5th: Chinese representative Mei Ru'ao, attending the special session of the World Peace Council, delivered the following speech on the morning of the 3rd regarding the issue of opposing the resurgence of Japanese militarism:

Dear Friends:

The World Peace Council, representing peace-loving people around the world, has made many outstanding efforts and achieved great successes in striving for lasting world peace and preventing a new world war.

However, contrary to our efforts, the United States government is doing everything possible to restore militarism in both Japan and Germany, attempting to use these two countries as its main tools for launching a new world war.

In February 1951, the First Session of the World Peace Council adopted the famous "Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Japanese Problem," condemning "the actions of the occupying countries in remilitarizing Japan, disregarding the wishes of the Japanese people."

In November 1951, the Second Session of the World Peace Council adopted a resolution against the separate peace treaty with Japan, pointing out that the peace treaty signed in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, "undermined international agreements and violated the interests of peace," and that "the inevitable consequence of this treaty will be the revival of Japanese militarism and the destruction of the economic life of the Japanese people."

Over the past six months, the development of events has proven the correctness of the World Peace Council's predictions. The United States government, at the expense of violating all solemn international agreements, signed the "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" at the San Francisco Conference on September 8, 1951, without the participation of India, Burma, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. On February 28, 1952, it forced Japan to sign the "Administrative Agreement." On April 28, 1952, the United States announced that these treaties and agreements, imposed on the Japanese people, would officially take effect from that day, and unilaterally announced the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan. On this day, the United States government, against the will of the Japanese people, also forced the Yoshida government to illegally sign a so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. This treaty is, of course, completely invalid for the Chinese people, but it shows the extent to which the United States government and its Japanese puppet are hostile to the Chinese people.

This series of actions by the United States government openly demonstrates that it is pursuing only one central goal: to remilitarize Japan and make Japan a hotbed for brewing a new war in the East. The "Peace Treaty with Japan" manufactured by the United States government, as well as the so-called "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," are all aimed at completely transforming Japan into a US military base and appendage, and making the entire Japanese manpower and resources serve the war policy of the United States. This undoubtedly has further threatened the peace and security of the entire Asia and Pacific region.

According to these treaties and agreements, the US occupation forces are not withdrawing from Japan. Instead, under the pretext of ensuring so-called "Japanese security," they are legalizing their privilege of long-term stationing of troops in Japan. The vast network of US military bases in Japan is not being canceled or reduced but is being expanded and strengthened. According to the preliminary schedule determined by the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," the United States maintains sixteen major air force bases in Japan, major naval bases in Yokosuka and Sasebo, as well as many military training grounds, shooting ranges, munitions factories, and US military garrison areas. The intention of the United States government to use Japan as a military base and a "springboard" for attacking the Asian continent, especially China and the Soviet Union, is all too clear.

Regarding the increase of Japanese armed forces, the United States government is relentlessly urging the Japanese government to accelerate its progress. In addition to 125,000 regular Japanese police officers, the "Police Reserve Force"—the core of the new Japanese army—organized under the name of "self-defense," is planned to be expanded from the current 75,000 to 110,000 this year, and the United States government insists that Japan expand it to 300,000 next year. These "Police Reserve Forces," commanded and trained by US military instructors, are equipped with US-made carbines, machine guns, rocket launchers, mortars, armored vehicles, and tanks. The Japanese "Maritime Safety Agency" is also developing into a regularized navy. Armed personnel of the Maritime Safety Agency are being trained by US Navy personnel. The Japanese government has now formulated a bill to establish a "Security Agency" in July of this year to serve as the command headquarters for the army and navy. In addition, the United States is also planning to rebuild the Japanese Air Force.

On March 8th of this year, the United States government also lifted the ban on Japan manufacturing military supplies and weapons, and on April 26th, returned more than 800 munitions factories that were originally designated for reparations. From the outbreak of the Korean War to the end of last November, the value of military supplies manufactured by US companies in Japanese factories reached 520 million US dollars. As of April 28th of this year, Japan manufactured 180 million aircraft bombs and 100,020 napalm bombs for US troops in Korea. Facts are demonstrating that Japan has already begun to serve as the United States' "Far East Arsenal."

Japanese war criminals who participated in the war of aggression have all been released or had their purges lifted. It is estimated that about 200,000 militarists have regained their right to hold public office, and many of them are serving the revival of militarism.

Economically, the burden imposed on the Japanese people by the United States is also very heavy. In the past six years, the Japanese people have provided the United States with more than 4.97 billion US dollars in military occupation expenses. Japan, which has nominally gained independence, will continue to bear this cost for the United States' "Far East Security." Japan's fiscal budget for this year has increased by 30 percent compared to last year, with approximately 70 percent directly or indirectly allocated for military-related purposes.

As a result of the United States government's military, political, and economic control over Japan, Japan's economy has become an appendage of the US economy, forced to serve the US war economy. Peaceful industries have been severely damaged, and the number of bankrupt small and medium-sized enterprises is increasing daily. As a result, the lives of the Japanese people are becoming increasingly impoverished, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people has reached more than ten million. According to statistics from the Japanese government, the average daily food requirement for a Japanese man is 2,500 calories, but in 1951 it was only 1,089 calories. The situation is even worse now. Not only are the living conditions of the Japanese people deteriorating, but their basic rights are also being blatantly deprived. A series of fascist legislation has deprived them of most of their human rights guarantees. The recent "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" is essentially a replica of the "Public Security Preservation Law" of the Japanese militarist era. Any individual or organization deemed to be engaged in so-called "subversive activities" will be severely punished. A large number of patriots striving for peace and democracy have been persecuted.

The remilitarization of Japan seriously hinders the Japanese nation's progress towards freedom, peace, and democracy, while threatening peace in Asia and the world. It has aroused immense anger and resistance among the Japanese people. As early as October 1951, six million people in Japan signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact among the five major powers, expressing their firm determination to oppose war and strive for peace. Japanese workers, students, and patriots from all walks of life, despite being in extremely difficult circumstances, have also been continuously waging tenacious struggles. For example, on March 1st of this year, there was a large rally of 100,000 people in Tokyo alone, protesting the reactionary policies of the Japanese government and raising slogans such as opposing the war budget and Japanese rearmament. On this year's May Day, the heroic Japanese working people, despite the crazy suppression by the US occupiers and the Japanese government, held large demonstrations involving three million people in more than 480 locations across the country, raising slogans such as "Oppose the rearmament of Japan and strive for national independence!" "Yankee go home!" "We want to defend peace and oppose war!" This patriotic struggle of the Japanese people for independence, peace, and freedom is developing vigorously.

The 1.6 billion people of Asia and the Pacific region not only deeply sympathize with this just struggle of the Japanese people but also regard it as a common responsibility. The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference was held in Beijing, China, from June 3rd to 6th, attended by 47 representatives from 20 countries in Asia, Australia, South America, and North America, including the United States and Japan. Although they came from different countries, spoke different languages, and held different political views and religious beliefs, they represented the common will of the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region to strive for peace. They called on all peace-loving people and organizations in all countries, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, ethnic differences, and occupational types, to unite widely and fight to safeguard the independence, freedom, and peace of the people of the Asia and Pacific region.

One of the main topics of the formal conference to be held at the end of September this year is "Opposing the Remilitarization of Japan, Opposing the Use of Japan as a Base of Aggression, to Eliminate the Serious Threat to Peace in Asia and the Pacific Region." This shows how much the people of Asia and the Pacific region value and are concerned about the threat posed by the revival of Japanese militarism!

The Chinese people have had long and painful experiences with Japanese militarist aggression. We resolutely oppose the remilitarization of Japan, and at the same time, we sincerely wish to live in peace, cooperate amicably, trade on a mutually beneficial basis, and mutually respect national independence and state sovereignty with the Japanese people. We hope that Japan will become a truly independent, peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Japan. The "Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement" signed on June 1st by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese representatives attending the International Economic Conference is a concrete manifestation of the willingness of the Chinese people to see Japan develop its own peaceful economy in a healthy manner and improve the living conditions of the Japanese people.

However, dear friends, the United States government's active remilitarization of Japan runs completely counter to our wishes. It not only violates the interests of the Japanese nation and deteriorates the lives of the Japanese people but also seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. Removing this threat is a major task before us. The resolutions of the previous two sessions of the World Peace Council on this issue have given great encouragement to the Japanese people and the Asian people. Now that the situation of the revival of Japanese militarism is becoming more and more serious, I believe that this Council will give greater importance to this important issue.

### 世界和平理事会特别会议三日会议上  我国代表梅汝璈的发言

    世界和平理事会特别会议三日会议上
    我国代表梅汝璈的发言
    【新华社柏林五日电】我国出席世界和平理事会特别会议的代表梅汝璈，在三日上午会议上就反对日本重新军国主义化问题发言如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    世界和平理事会代表全世界爱好和平的人民，为争取世界持久和平，阻止新的世界战争，曾作过许多卓越的努力，并有过巨大的成就。
    然而，和我们的努力恰恰相反，美国政府却千方百计地在恢复日、德两国的军国主义，企图利用这两个国家做它发动新的世界大战的主要工具。
    一九五一年二月，世界和平理事会的第一次会议，通过了著名的“关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议”，谴责了“占领国家不顾日本人民的愿望，而使日本重新军国主义化的行为”。
    一九五一年十一月，世界和平理事会的第二次会议，又通过了一个关于反对单独对日和约的决议，指出一九五一年九月八日在旧金山签订的对日和约是“破坏了国际协定并违反了和平的利益”，指出“这个条约无可避免的后果，将是日本军国主义的复活和日本人民的经济生活遭到破坏”。
    最近半年多来，事态的发展，证明世界和平理事会的预见的正确性。美国政府不惜破坏一切庄严的国际协议，曾于一九五一年九月八日在旧金山会议上，签订了没有印度、缅甸、苏联和中华人民共和国参加的“对日和约”和美日“安全条约”；一九五二年二月二十八日又强迫日本签订“行政协定”，一九五二年四月二十八日，美国宣布这些强加于日本人民身上的条约和协定，自该日起正式生效，并片面地宣布解散了远东委员会和盟国对日委员会。在这一天美国政府违反着日本人民的意志，又强迫吉田政府和台湾蒋介石非法地签订了一个所谓“日华和约”。这个条约对中国人民当然是完全无效的，但它却表示着美国政府和他的日本傀儡对于中国人民是何等地仇视。
    美国政府这一系列的行为，露骨地说明着它只追求一个中心目标，这便是：使日本重新军国主义化，使日本成为在东方酝酿新战争的温床。美国政府制造的“对日和约”，以及所谓“安全条约”“行政协定”，其目的都是要彻底地变日本为美国军事基地和附属国，使整个日本的人力财力都服务于美国的战争政策。这无疑地已使整个亚洲和太平洋区域的和平与安全遭受到了更进一步的威胁。
    根据这些条约与协定，美国占领军并不撤出日本，反而藉口保证所谓“日本的安全”，使它在日本长期驻军的特权合法化；美国在日本的庞大军事基地网不但是没有取消或缩小，而是正在扩大和加强。根据美日“行政协定”初步决定的附表，美国在日本保有主要空军基地十六处，主要海军基地有横须贺和佐世保，此外还有许多的军事演习地、射击场、军需工厂和美军驻扎区。美国政府要以日本为军事基地和进攻亚洲大陆特别是中苏两国的“跳板”的企图，是再明显不过了。
    对于增加日本武装部队，美国政府更是毫不放松地在督促日本政府加速进行。除了十二万五千名的日本正规警察之外，以“自卫”名义组织的—日本新陆军的核心“警察后备队”，正被计划自现时的七万五千人在今年内扩充至十一万人，美国政府并坚持要求日本于明年度内扩充至三十万人。这些由美国军事教官统率训练的“警察后备队”，装备有美国造的卡宾枪、机关枪、火箭炮、迫击炮、装甲车和战车。日本“海上保安厅”也正在向正规化的海军发展。海上保安厅的武装人员正由美国海军人员担任训练。日本政府现已制订了一个法案，计划在今年七月建立“保安厅”，作为统辖陆海军的统帅部。此外，美国也正在计划重建日本的空军。
    今年三月八日，美国政府又撤销了禁止日本制造军火和武器的禁令，并于四月二十六日发还了八百多家原被指定充当赔偿的军需工厂。自朝鲜战争爆发起至去年十一月底止，美国在日本工厂制造的军火的价值达五亿二千万美元。至今年四月二十八日为止，日本给美国在朝鲜的部队制造了飞机炸弹一亿八千万个，凝固汽油弹十万零二千个。事实正说明着：日本已经起了充当美国“远东兵工厂”的作用。
    曾经参加过侵略战争的日本战犯已尽被释放或解除整肃，统计约二十万的军国主义分子已经恢复了任公职的权利，其中许多正在为军国主义的复活服务。
    在经济方面，美国给予日本人民的负担也是非常沉重的。在过去六年中，日本人民曾经为美国提供了四十九亿七千余万美元的军事占领费。获得名义上独立的日本，今后仍需继续为美国的“远东安全”负担这项费用。日本今年度的财政预算比去年增加了百分之三十，直接间接用于军事方面的达百分之七十左右。
    美国政府对于日本实行军事、政治和经济的控制的结果，已使日本的经济成了美国经济的附庸，被迫为美国的战争经济服务。和平工业横遭破坏，中小企业倒闭者日有增加。日本人民的生活因而愈益穷困，失业及半失业的人数达一千万以上。根据日本政府的统计，日本一个男子每日食物平均需要二千五百卡路里的发热量，而一九五一年却仅有一○八九卡路里。现在的情形更糟。日本人民不仅生活条件日益恶化，他们的基本权利亦横被剥夺。一系列的法西斯的立法使他们丧失了大部分的人权保障。最近的“防止破坏活动法案”实质上就是日本军国主义时代的“治安维持法”的翻版，任何个人或团体只要被指为从事所谓“破坏活动”，就要遭到严厉的惩罚。大批争取和平民主的爱国者受到了迫害。
    日本重新军国主义化严重地阻碍了日本民族走向自由、和平和民主的发展，同时威胁了亚洲及世界的和平。它已激起了日本人民无比的愤怒和反抗。早在一九五一年十月，日本就有六百万人在世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名，表示了他们反对战争、争取和平的坚决志愿。日本工人、学生和各阶层的爱国人士，虽处在极度恶劣的环境下，也曾不断地进行着顽强不屈的斗争。举例来说：今年三月一日，东京一地就曾有十万人的大集会，抗议日本政府的反动政策，提出反对战争预算和日本重新武装等口号；今年五一劳动节，英勇的日本劳动人民，又曾不顾美国占领者及日本政府的疯狂镇压，在全国各地四百八十余处，举行了三百万人的大示威，提出了“反对重新武装日本，争取民族独立！”“美国兵滚回去！”“我们要保卫和平，反对战争！”等口号。日本人民这种争取独立、和平、自由的爱国斗争，正在昂扬地发展着。
    亚洲及太平洋地区十六亿人民，对日本人民的这种正义的斗争，不但寄与深切的同情，并且引为共同的责任。六月三日至六日在中国北京举行了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议，出席的有来自亚洲、澳洲、南美洲、北美洲二十个国家包括美国和日本的四十七位代表。他们虽然来自不同的国度，说着不同的语言，抱着不同的政治见解与宗教信仰，却代表了全亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取和平的共同意志。他们号召各国所有爱好和平的人士和社团，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，广泛地团结起来，为保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平而奋斗。
    在今年九月底行将召开的正式大会，其主要议题之一是“反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁。”这说明着亚洲人民和太平洋地区人民对于日本军国主义的复活所造成的威胁是怎样地重视和关切！
    中国人民对于日本军国主义的侵略，有过长期的惨痛的经验。我们坚决反对日本的重新军国主义化，同时我们对于日本人民却衷心地愿意与他们和平相处、友好合作、互惠通商、彼此尊重民族独立和国家主权。我们希望日本成为一个真正独立的和平的民主的和繁荣的日本。今年六月一日我国国际贸易促进委员会与日本出席国际经济会议代表所签定的“中日贸易协议”，就是我国人民愿意看到日本能够健全发展自己的和平经济，使日本人民生活条件能够改善的具体表现。
    但是，亲爱的朋友们，美国政府积极地使日本重新军国主义化的行为，却完全与我们的意愿背道而驰，它不但违反日本民族的利益，使日本人民生活恶化，同时也严重地威胁了亚洲及世界的和平。祛除这个威胁，是摆在我们面前的一个重大任务。世界和平理事会前两次会议关于这个问题的决议曾经给了日本人民和亚洲人民很大的鼓励。现在由于日本军国主义复活的形势益趋严重，我相信本次理事会必能对这个重要问题给以更大的重视。
