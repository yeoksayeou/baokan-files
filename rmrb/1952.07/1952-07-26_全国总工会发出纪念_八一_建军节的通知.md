    【新华社二十五日讯】中华全国总工会日前发出纪念“八一”建军节二十五周年的通知。通知说：八月一日，是光辉的中国人民解放军建军二十五周年的节日。今天中国工人阶级与全体人民，能够在和平的环境下，安心努力生产，建设我们自由与幸福的生活，这是与中国人民解放军的英勇战斗和强大的力量分不开的。为了纪念“八一”建军节二十五周年，中华全国总工会通知各地工会组织除了要向广大职工宣传中国人民解放军英勇斗争的历史，号召全体职工开展增产节约运动来迎接“八一”建军节外，并进行如下纪念活动：
    （一）动员职工在精简节约原则下，向当地驻军、伤兵医院、荣誉军人及烈属、军属，写致敬信、慰问信或派代表进行慰问。
    （二）约请当地驻军的首长、战斗英雄，向工厂职工做报告，介绍人民解放军的斗争历史与战斗故事。
    （三）在不妨害生产的原则下，尽可能地以工厂为单位，与附近驻军开联欢会。
