The occurrence of cotton pests in cotton-producing areas this year is earlier and more widespread than last year. Cotton fields in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Pingyuan, and northern Jiangsu have all experienced varying degrees of cotton pest infestation, with the situation in Henan Province being particularly serious. However, due to early preparations for cotton pest control in various regions, the control measures this year have been timely. According to statistics from seven regions, including Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Shandong, Henan, northern Jiangsu, and western Liaoning, cooperatives in these regions have already supplied local farmers with the following cotton pest control agents: 7.73 million jin of cotton oil soap, over 2 million jin of tobacco leaves, and 1.75 million jin of lime-sulfur mixture. In addition, there are over 1.36 million jin of DDT, rotenone powder, insecticide powder, lead arsenate, copper sulfate, and wettable 666. Most of these cotton pest control agents have already been applied to cotton fields affected by cotton pests. In Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces, cotton pests have been treated universally two to three times so far, playing a significant role in eliminating cotton pests and ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. Tobacco water is the most popular among cotton farmers in terms of cotton pest control agents because it is easy to prepare, convenient to apply, does not harm cotton seedlings, and is relatively inexpensive, making it worthy of promotion and widespread use.

In order to implement the Government Administration Council’s "Emergency Notice on Pest Control" and prepare sufficient agents to eliminate cotton pests, the Central Financial and Economic Commission has specially allocated an additional 200 billion yuan in agricultural pesticide loans, entrusting the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to purchase and prepare cotton pest control agents. This batch of loans has been distributed by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas. Currently, cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas are successively purchasing, manufacturing, and transferring these agents to supply cotton farmers in large quantities.

Some cooperatives in certain regions have not paid sufficient attention to the work of supplying cotton pest control agents. For example, the Anyang Special District Cooperative in Pingyuan Province locked the central government's "Joint Instructions on Purchasing and Preparing Cotton Pest Control Agents" in a drawer until it was discovered during an inspection by the inspection team. The Xuchang area of Henan used funds for purchasing cotton pest control agents to buy arsenic ore (which is not used for cotton pest control). Some cooperatives also harbor incorrect ideas such as fearing trouble, fearing losses, and fearing stockpiles, and do not actively prepare to purchase cotton pest control agents, but passively deposit the funds in the bank. This kind of paralyzing emotion and irresponsible work style must be quickly corrected.

    中央财经委员会增拨棉虫药贷款两千亿元
    各产棉区合作社大量调运棉虫药剂供应农民
    今年产棉区棉虫发生的比去年为早，地区较广。河北、山西、河南、山东、平原、苏北等地棉田都轻重不同地发生了棉虫，其中以河南省棉虫为害情况较为严重。但由于各地对防治棉虫工作早有准备，因而今年的防治是及时的。根据河北、山西、平原、山东、河南、苏北、辽西等七个地区的统计，这些地区的合作社已经供应当地农民的棉虫药计有棉油皂七百七十三万斤，烟叶二百多万斤，石灰硫磺合剂一百七十五万斤；此外，还有滴滴涕、鱼藤粉、除虫粉、砒酸铅、硫酸铜、可湿性六六六等共一百三十六万多斤。这些棉虫药并已大部施用于发生棉虫的棉田。山西、平原两省到目前对棉虫已经普遍治了两次到三次，对消灭棉虫、保证棉花丰产起了很大的作用。在使用棉虫药方面以烟草水最受棉农欢迎，因为它的制法简单、施用便利、不伤棉苗，而且价格也比较便宜，是值得提倡广泛使用的。
    为了贯彻执行政务院“关于防治害虫的紧急通知”，准备足够的药剂以消灭棉虫，中央财政经济委员会特增拨农药贷款二千亿元委托全国合作总社购备防治棉虫药剂。这批贷款已由全国合作总社分配给各产棉区的合作社。目前产棉区各级合作社正陆续收购、制造和调运此项药剂，以便大量供应棉农使用。
    有些地区的合作社对供应棉虫药工作没有足够的重视，如平原省安阳专区合作社把中央“关于购备防治棉虫药剂的联合指示”锁在抽屉里，直到检查组去检查时才被发现；河南许昌把购买棉虫药的款项，买了信石（不是防治棉虫用的）；还有的合作社存在着怕麻烦、怕赔钱、怕积压的错误思想，不去积极准备购置棉虫药，而是消极地把款存放在银行里。这种麻痹情绪和不负责任的工作作风，是必须迅速纠正的。
