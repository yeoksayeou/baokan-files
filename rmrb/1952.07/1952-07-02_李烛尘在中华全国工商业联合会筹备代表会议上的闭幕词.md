Comrades of the Presidium, fellow representatives:

    The Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has successfully concluded today. Through the joint efforts of the representatives present over the past ten days, under the care and leadership of the Central People's Government, and with the promotion and guidance of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the tireless efforts of the comrades participating in the meeting, our meeting has achieved complete success. During the meeting, we heard the opening speech of Chairman Chen Shutong and the speech of Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, and we fully support the direction of effort for industry and commerce indicated by Chairman Chen Shutong and Director Chen Yun. Under these important inspirations, our entire body of representatives from industry and commerce conducted self-examination and gained a clearer understanding of the great progress of national construction over the past three years under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the increasingly prosperous future of legitimate industry and commerce. We will return to our respective posts with greater confidence and do our best for the construction of the motherland.

    Our preparatory representative meeting was convened after the "Five-Anti" movement. This great social reform movement that changed customs and habits is also a great ideological transformation movement for our industry and commerce. After this great movement, there is no doubt that our industry and commerce has improved its political understanding. However, it cannot be denied that some of us in industry and commerce, after being exposed to many of the evils left over from the old society, mistakenly harbored certain doubts and concerns. Through the discussions and self-criticism of our meeting, we have fully realized that the "Five-Anti" movement is of extremely great significance to our national construction and the ideological transformation of industry and commerce. In this movement of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and treating the illness to save the patient, the People's Government, adhering to the principle of combining strictness with leniency, and combining transformation with punishment, after strictly examining those in industry and commerce who had committed "Five Vices" crimes, also took care of the difficulties of industry and commerce in terms of verification, settlement, refund of property, and tax supplementation, and carried out lenient treatment. The government has done its utmost for our industry and commerce. From now on, our industry and commerce should seek within ourselves, honestly abide by the Common Program, obey the leadership of the working class, the state-owned economy, and the state plan, eliminate the "Five Vices," and actively engage in legitimate production and operation. This is in the interests of the people of the whole country and the interests of all legitimate industrialists and businessmen.

    After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the corrupt parts of private industry and commerce were exposed. Some difficulties appeared in the painful transformation process. Undoubtedly, these are the difficulties of getting rid of the old and creating the new, the difficulties in development, and the difficulties in economic improvement. Director Chen Yun's report has clearly instructed us that after the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, "it is necessary to adjust the relationship between public and private, and the relationship between labor and capital on a new basis." As for how to guarantee the reasonable profits of private industry and commerce after eliminating the "Five Vices," stipulate processing and ordering specifications, smooth the exchange between urban and rural areas and inside and outside, reduce bank interest rates, correct the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy tax burdens, adjust labor-capital relations according to the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, and prevent the recurrence of the "Five Vices," clear solutions have been proposed based on the actual situation. The relevant departments of the Central People's Government are carefully studying and taking various effective measures to ensure the specific realization of Director Chen Yun's instructions. Some of these measures, such as expanding the scope of processing orders, loans, and purchases, reviewing and adjusting the labor costs, prices, and acceptance standards of processing orders, and lowering the interest rates on bank deposits and loans, have been specifically implemented before or during the meeting. These measures will undoubtedly create more favorable conditions for the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. The doubts and concerns existing in the hearts of the representatives have been swept away after hearing these reports and seeing these measures.

    Fellow representatives, we must recognize that the development process of New Democratic economic construction is also an economic reorganization process. In this development and reorganization process, there will inevitably be some difficulties. These difficulties can only be resolved with the gradual development of national construction, and they will definitely be resolved. Some problems require a period of time and a process to solve. We should not demand that everything be solved all at once without distinction or considering objective possibilities; nor should we rely entirely on the government to solve everything, and abandon our own subjective efforts and our own responsibilities. The People's Government takes care of law-abiding industrialists and businessmen in all aspects, and we industrialists and businessmen should be self-reliant, overcome difficulties, and promote our enthusiasm for production and operation, so as to better contribute our strength to the great construction cause of the country.

    Fellow representatives, through our joint efforts over the past ten days, we have established the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and established a national organization of industry and commerce. The one hundred and sixty preparatory committee members, elected through repeated consultation and democratic election, include representatives from public and private enterprises, cooperatives, and large, medium, and small cities and large, medium, and small enterprises nationwide, including representatives of ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and people related to industry and commerce. It has broad representation and is a manifestation of the great unity of industry and commerce nationwide. Before the official establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Preparatory Committee will exercise its functions and powers on its behalf. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce shoulders a great responsibility. It has the responsibility to lead industrialists and businessmen to abide by the Common Program, implement the policies and decrees of the People's Government, guide private industry and commerce to develop production and improve operations under the overall national economic plan; at the same time, it should represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, reflect opinions to the People's Government, make suggestions, and organize industrialists and businessmen to study, transform their thinking, and participate in various patriotic movements. We should follow the spirit indicated by Chairman Chen Shutong in his opening speech, so that the Federation of Industry and Commerce can truly take care of public and private economies, cooperatives, large, medium, and small cities, large, medium, and small enterprises across the country, and take care of ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese, so that the Federation of Industry and Commerce can conform to Premier Zhou's instructions: "The Federation of Industry and Commerce will gradually become an organization of the entire industry and commerce, including all cities, all strata, and all industries, and enable small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to enjoy equal rights." For the organization of the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various places, if they do not conform to the above spirit, they should be reorganized and reorganized in accordance with the spirit of the conference, so that the interests of all classes and strata of industry and commerce can be properly taken care of, and so that large, medium, and small households can each get what they deserve.

    Fellow representatives, we, the representatives present at the meeting, shoulder important tasks in the industry and commerce and the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various places. After the great "Five-Anti" movement, and after the enlightenment and instructions we have received in this conference, our political understanding has been further improved, and we have gained a clear understanding of the development prospects of private industry and commerce in our minds. Therefore, we also shoulder a great responsibility. When we return to our respective posts, we should not only publicize the spirit and decisions of the conference, but also become examples of industrialists and businessmen who conscientiously implement the Common Program and earnestly do a good job in production and operation, and actively promote industry and commerce to earnestly study the Common Program and resolutely prevent the recurrence of the "Five Vices." Only by constantly improving our political understanding and frequently carrying out criticism and self-criticism can we gradually transform our thinking and truly become industrialists and businessmen needed by the new China.

    Looking forward to the bright and splendid future of our great motherland, we should be full of confidence, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, strive for the construction of our great motherland!

专栏：

    李烛尘在中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的闭幕词主席团、各位代表：
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议今天胜利闭幕了。经过十天来与会代表们的共同努力，在中央人民政府的关怀和领导下，在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的推动和指导下，在参加会议工作的同志们的辛劳不倦的努力下，我们的会议已经获得圆满的成功。在会议中我们听到了陈叔通主席的开幕词和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任的讲话，我们完全拥护陈叔通主席和陈云主任所指示的工商界的努力方向。我们全体工商界代表在这些重要的启示下，进行了自我检查，更清楚地认识了在毛主席领导下，三年来国家建设的伟大进展和正当工商业日趋繁荣的前途。我们将带着更大的信心，回到我们各自的工作岗位，为祖国的建设事业尽到我们应该的努力。
    我们的筹备代表会议，是在“五反”运动之后召开的，这一场伟大的移风易俗的社会改革运动，对于我们工商界来讲，更是一个伟大的思想改造运动，经过了这一场伟大的运动，无疑地，我们工商界提高了政治认识。但不容讳言的，我们工商业者中曾有一部分人在被揭露了旧社会遗留下的许多污毒之后，错误地抱着某些怀疑与顾虑。经过我们会议的讨论和自我检讨，我们已经完全认识到“五反”运动对于我们国家建设和工商界的思想改造，都有极其伟大的意义。在这一次惩前毖后、治病救人的运动中，人民政府本着严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针，在严格检查了我们工商业者某些犯有“五毒”罪行的人们之后，又在核实定案，退财补税方面，照顾了工商业者的困难，进行了宽大的处理。政府对我们工商界已经做到仁至义尽，今后我们工商界就应该求其在我，老老实实遵照共同纲领办事，服从工人阶级、国营经济与国家计划的领导，清除“五毒”，积极从事正当的生产经营，这是全国人民的利益，也是一切正当工商业者的利益。
    经过“三反”、“五反”运动，私营工商业的腐朽部分被揭发出来了，在痛苦的改造过程中出现了一些困难，无疑地，这是去旧生新中的困难，是发展中的困难，是经济好转中的困难。陈云主任的报告中已经明确指示我们，在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利结束后，“需要在新的基础上来调整公私关系、劳资关系”，对于在消除“五毒”后如何保障私营工商业的合理利润，规定加工订货规格，畅通城乡内外交流，降低银行利息，纠正税收负担中畸轻畸重的现象，按照发展生产、劳资两利原则调整劳资关系，和防止再犯“五毒”等，均已根据实际情况，提出了明确的解决办法。中央人民政府各有关部门更已在慎重研究，并采取各种有效措施，以保证陈云主任指示的具体实现。其中某些措施，如扩大加工订货、贷款、收购的范围，审查并调整加工订货的工缴、货价和验收货物的尺度，降低银行存放款的利息等，已在会议前或会议中见诸具体实施了。这些措施，无疑地都将为正当的私营工商业的发展创造更为有利的条件。与会代表心中所存在的怀疑和顾虑，在听到了这些报告和看到了这些措施后，已被一扫而空了。
    各位代表先生，我们必须认识新民主主义经济建设的发展过程，同时也是一个经济改组过程。在这种发展和改组过程中，不可免的还会有若干困难的，这些困难只有在国家建设的逐步发展中才能得到解决，也一定能够得到解决。有些问题需要有一段时间、一个过程才能解决。我们不应该不加区别，不考虑客观的可能性，要求一下子通统解决；我们也不应该一切都依赖政府来解决，而放弃了自己主观的努力，和自己所应负的责任。人民政府从各方面来照顾守法的工商业者，我们工商业者就应该自力更生，克服困难，发扬我们生产和经营的积极性，在国家的伟大建设事业中，更好地贡献出自己的力量。
    各位代表先生，经过十天来我们共同的努力，我们已经产生了中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，建立了工商界的全国性组织。在经过反复协商、民主选举的一百六十名筹备委员中，包括了全国公私营企业、合作社以及大、中、小城市和大、中、小企业的代表，包括少数民族、海外侨胞以及和工商界有关人士的代表，它具备有广泛的代表性，是全国工商界大团结的体现。在中华全国工商业联合会正式建立前，筹备委员会将代行它的职权，中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会肩负着重大的责任，它有责任领导工商业者遵守共同纲领，推行人民政府的政策法令，指导私营工商业在国家总的经济计划下发展生产，改善经营；同时又应该代表工商业者的合法利益，向人民政府反映意见，提出建议，并组织工商业者进行学习，改造思想和参加各种爱国运动。我们应该遵照陈叔通主席在开幕词中所指示的精神，使工商业联合会真正地能够照顾到公私营经济、合作社、全国大、中、小城市、大、中、小企业，照顾到少数民族和海外侨胞，这样才能使工商业联合会符合于周总理指示的：“工商业联合会，将逐渐成为全体工商界的，即包括各城市、各阶层和各行业的，并使中小工商业者享有平等权利的组织”。对于各地的工商业联合会的组织，如果不符合于上述精神的，应该本着大会的精神进行整理和改组，使工商界的各阶级与阶层的利益都能得到适当的照顾，使大、中、小户都能各得其所。
    各位代表先生，我们与会的代表，在各地的工商界和工商业联合会中都担负着重要的任务，经过了伟大的“五反”运动，又经过了这一次会议中我们所得到的启发和指示，我们的政治认识已得到了进一步的提高，思想上对私营工商业的发展前途也已经获得明确的认识。因此，我们也肩负着重大的责任，在我们回到各自的岗位时，我们不仅应该宣传大会的精神与决定，还应该成为切实执行共同纲领、认真搞好生产与经营的工商界的榜样，并积极推动工商界认真地学习共同纲领，坚决地防止重犯“五毒”，只有不断地提高我们的政治认识和经常地开展批评与自我批评，才能够逐步地改造我们的思想，真正成为新中国所需要的工商业者。
    瞻望我们伟大祖国光辉灿烂的前途，我们应该满怀信心，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，为我们伟大祖国的建设而奋斗！
