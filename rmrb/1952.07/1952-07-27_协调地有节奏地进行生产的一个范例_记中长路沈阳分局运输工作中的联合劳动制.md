    An Example of Coordinated and Rhythmic Production
    —On the Joint Labor System in the Transportation Work of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway

    The railway is an extremely complex large-scale production enterprise. If it is compared to a machine, it is a linked engine that actively transports blood through the economic arteries of the motherland. As the high tide of the motherland's economic construction is about to arrive, the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement to promote the work of all railway departments is being carried out in various parts of the country in a timely manner. Each gear of this blood-transporting linked engine needs to rotate rapidly in a coordinated and rhythmic manner. If one gear is blocked, it will affect the rotation of other gears. Therefore, it requires the Chinese railway workers, as the masters of the machine, to highly promote the spirit of collectivism and not allow the personnel of any railway department to have localism that hinders the whole. Soviet experts have set a brilliant example for us in this regard on the China Changchun Railway. July 1st was the day when the Shenyang Branch began to implement the close-knit operation diagram. On this day, all the employees of the entire branch were excitedly cheering for a major event in their production reform; they were carrying out rhythmic production for a branch freight train close-knit operation diagram formulated under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, which they all jointly abide by. The reporter visited the dispatching office of the branch dispatching office, the command center of the branch's transportation work, and saw this close-knit operation diagram, formulated by learning from Soviet advanced experience, which all railway personnel regarded as national law. This close-knit train operation diagram and locomotive operation diagram have many red and black lines and many station names and train numbers. They use charts to indicate the train numbers that the locomotives are to pull. The chart of this close-knit operation diagram has the salient features of socialist enterprise management—a high degree of planning and the conscious and coordinated cooperation of all departments to simultaneously shorten the turnaround time of vehicles and locomotives. At the same time, the close-knit operation diagram fixes the new production quotas and production indicators created by the workers, thereby encouraging workers to continuously break through old production quotas and production standards and create new production quotas and production standards. In turn, this helps dispatching personnel to revise the operation diagram in a timely manner, so that the actions of various departments are more closely coordinated.

    Since the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement was widely carried out in the Shenyang Branch, the workers, with a spirit of innovation, greatly exceeded the axle load, broke the old production quotas and production standards, and created new quotas. Soviet experts helped the dispatching office personnel to organize the new quotas for over-axle traction created by the workers themselves into a close-knit operation diagram, specifically stipulating that the train formation of three trains, such as Train 961 from Dashiqiao to Sujiatun Station, should double the over-axle load, and that three over-axle trains should also be formed between Siping and Sujiatun Station. This solved the contradiction in locomotive utilization and vehicle turnaround caused by the imbalance between incoming and outgoing trains in the Shenyang Branch, and closely combined large-scale over-axle loading with fast running. After the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement was launched, the shunting personnel learned Li Xikui's advanced shunting method, which shortened the shunting time; the commercial personnel learned Yang Maolin's loading method, which improved loading efficiency; the train inspection personnel used the Soviet Shchebylikin's parallel operation method of non-detachment repair, which shortened the train inspection time; and the dispatching office personnel re-examined the train running schedule based on these new situations, reducing the number of stops at eight water supply stations. In this way, due to the reduction of stopping time, the train travel speed (per hour) stipulated in the close-knit operation diagram was increased by 3.6 kilometers compared with the June target. Due to the close cooperation of the train inspection personnel, the inspection time of trains at the station stipulated in the close-knit operation diagram was reduced by six minutes. In this way, the close-knit operation diagram consolidated the results of the rhythmic and coordinated actions of the branch dispatching office, station, locomotive depot, and train inspection personnel, and at the same time, used the close-knit operation diagram to promote closer cooperation between various departments, to consciously and coordinately create greater achievements for the completion of unified transportation tasks.

    In order to complete the national law that all railway departments jointly abide by—the close-knit operation diagram—the highly conscious disciplined large-scale joint labor must also have the ideological leadership of the Party organization, fixed shifts in labor organization, contact contracts in terms of system, unified parallel operation methods in technical operations, and a "full house red" competition in labor competitions to guarantee it.

    First of all, the joint labor system of the Shenyang Branch was victorious only after a period of intense ideological struggle against localism. This ideological struggle began among the command personnel of the branch dispatching office. As early as a year ago, Soviet experts introduced the Soviet advanced experience of Gudafin, Zagorko, and Sudnikov's dispatching work methods to the Chinese employees of the Shenyang Branch dispatching office. These advanced dispatching work methods all run through the spirit of joint labor, especially the Sudnikov's dispatching work method introduced in the autumn of 1951, which strengthened the close joint labor of train dispatching and locomotive dispatching. The characteristic of this dispatching work method is that train dispatching not only controls train operation and vehicle utilization, but also controls locomotive utilization, and at the same time improves the operating efficiency of locomotives and vehicles.

    However, when these advanced Soviet dispatching methods were implemented in the Shenyang Branch dispatching office, they encountered obstacles from localism, so they were not quickly implemented. Because the train dispatching director only paid attention to the fast turnaround of vehicles and was afraid that there were not enough locomotives to use, for example, if only 20 locomotives were actually needed, he lied to the locomotive dispatching director: "Need 24." They often had four extra locomotives fired up for standby. When the locomotives had added coal and water, and the fire had been burning for several hours without the station coming to ask for locomotives, the locomotive dispatching director became anxious and asked the train dispatching: "Why haven't they been used? The locomotives were fired up and prepared early!" The train dispatching then colluded with the station personnel to deceive the locomotive dispatching director, saying: "The goods have not been loaded." Or saying: "The trains from other bureaus have not arrived, and the trains cannot be formed. This locomotive has to be unused." In this way, four locomotives were fired up in vain every day and waiting for trains, wasting a lot of coal, water, and manpower for the country. Similarly, because the locomotive dispatching director also had localistic thinking, he slowly suspected that there were "empty shells" in the locomotive plan required by the train dispatching director. He did not use proper methods to give the train dispatching director suggestions, but colluded with the locomotive depot personnel to jointly lie to the train dispatching director, saying: "Only 20 locomotives can be used, and the rest are broken and cannot be used." They thought: "Regardless of whether you have 'empty shells' or not, anyway, we have fewer locomotives, the utilization efficiency of locomotives is higher, and we can run more than 500 kilometers." In this way, when there was a boom in freight sources, even when the station had really formed the trains and was waiting for locomotives, the locomotive dispatching director would still say: "There are no locomotives in the locomotive depot." This not only made the trains formed unable to be sent out, affecting the train turnaround time, but also sometimes caused the station to be blocked with trains full of lines, preventing other trains from passing in time, causing great losses to the country. Therefore, due to the serious localism of train dispatching and locomotive dispatching in the branch dispatching office, the advanced Soviet dispatching methods could not be implemented. In November 1951, in order to ensure the implementation of Sudnikov's dispatching method to strengthen the close joint labor of train dispatching and locomotive dispatching, the General Branch of the Shenyang Branch Organ of the Communist Party of China began to organize the Party branches of the vehicle and locomotive sections to merge the locomotive dispatching and train dispatching to form a Party group, and carried out criticism and self-criticism within the Party to thoroughly criticize localism. Train dispatching director Sun Xiancai and locomotive dispatching director Li Guangxiang both deeply examined themselves at the Party group meeting and formulated rectification methods. Between the station and the locomotive depot and vehicle depot, with the help of the local Party committee of the Communist Party of China, the overall concept of thinking was corrected within the Party. The Sujiatun Local Party Committee of the Communist Party of China helped the Sujiatun Vehicle Depot and Locomotive Depot to review "In the past, we did not realize that everyone was serving the country's transportation tasks, but thought that the locomotive and vehicles were serving the station. As soon as the stationmaster had 'localism,' we were unwilling to cooperate, and took the country's transportation tasks as a child's play." Everyone also deeply reviewed that in March and April last year, due to the disunity of locomotives, vehicles, and stations, the Sujiatun Station was blocked with trains full of lines, and the trains could only be formed at Shenyang Station and Siping Station. As a result, Shenyang Station and Siping Station were also full of lines, which affected the completion of the Shenyang Branch's transportation tasks as a whole and caused huge losses to the country. The Chinese Communist Party branches of various departments in the Sujiatun area and other areas' Chinese Communist Party organizations seized this vivid example of causing huge losses to the country due to "localism" to conduct ideological education on the overall concept, which powerfully laid a deep ideological foundation for the joint labor system in the transportation work of the Shenyang Branch.

    After the joint labor system of the Shenyang Branch had a continuous ideological foundation for opposing localism, the fixed shift system and the contact system to ensure the thorough implementation of the contact contract also appeared in labor organization and system in a corresponding manner.

    The fixed shift is to further consolidate the large-scale joint labor from the labor organization. It makes the train dispatcher, dispatching director, locomotive dispatcher, dispatching director, station duty stationmaster, dispatcher, shunting operator, line duty officer, signalman, commercial weigher, locomotive depot duty officer, dispatcher, shunting locomotive, vehicle depot inspection director, duty officer, inspector, and train crew duty conductor of the branch dispatching office participating in the joint labor hand over shifts at the same time. When this department is on duty for Class A, the other departments are also on duty for Class A on the same day. In this way, the superiority of this new labor organization fully demonstrates the high organization of socialist enterprises. These personnel are fixed on duty on the same day, so that everyone is familiar with each other, understands each other's personality, characteristics, and work ability. The branch train dispatcher knows the advantages and disadvantages of the personnel on duty at the station, locomotive depot, and inspection section at the same time. In this way, responsibility can be clearly defined and contact is convenient. In addition, because the close-knit transportation map fixes the locomotive turnaround (that is, after the locomotive arrives at the destination, it can promptly pull another train and return, so that the locomotive does not stay for too long), and fixes the train numbers, the branch dispatcher can simultaneously understand the characteristics of the driver and the train personnel. Doing so enables the staff of various railway departments to work more harmoniously and rhythmically in order to complete a unified goal.

    The conclusion of contact contracts by various departments enriches the joint labor system in the transportation work of the Shenyang Branch and expresses it in clear terms. This contact contract, voluntarily concluded by the masses to oppose localism, provides a mass supervision and guarantee for the thorough implementation of joint labor. In the contact contract concluded between Sujiatun Station and Sujiatun Vehicle Depot, it is stipulated that the station shall guarantee to send the vehicles to be repaired (i.e., red ticket cars) to the designated line in a timely manner. In the past, the station committed localism and did not send the vehicles to be repaired to the vehicle depot in a timely manner, so that the workers in the vehicle depot had nothing to do after going to work. When a large number of vehicles to be repaired were sent to the vehicle depot together, the inspection workers had to work overtime and could not finish their work. Now, this unreasonable phenomenon no longer exists. The vehicle depot also guarantees to the station that "If a direct train is encountered, red ticket cars will not be detained without jeopardizing safety." This is also stipulated to overcome the localism phenomenon that the vehicle depot used to detain "red ticket cars" indiscriminately, preventing direct trains from departing on time. In this way, the contact contract also helps employees consolidate the overall view of thinking from the system.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the contact contract and the better role of the fixed shift, the stations and sections under the branch also organized the personnel on duty every day into a group, with the station dispatcher as the group leader, and formulated a contact system and a meeting system. After the station dispatcher takes over the shift, he informs the branch dispatcher of the shift plan and immediately conveys it to the various departments to prepare in time. He also contacts the various departments every three hours. And after the daily shift handover, he holds a meeting with the various departments, or uses telephone contact to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the day's work, and corrects the shortcomings at any time.

    After having the fixed shift in labor organization and the contact contract and contact system in the system, to ensure that the joint labor system is implemented in specific operations, it is also necessary to create a new set of operation methods. Soviet experts helped the stations under the Shenyang Branch create a "unified parallel operation method." The "unified parallel operation method" concentrates the superiority of the joint labor system on the on-site operation. It prominently demonstrates the high organization of socialist enterprises and the significant feature of its various departments closely cooperating and rhythmically carrying out production: This operation method is to carry out work on each train in two sections, front and rear. When the car number clerk finishes copying the car number of the previous batch of vehicles and transfers them to the departure line, the vehicle depot's inspection team, the commercial weigher, and the train crew's conductor have already prepared in advance at the designated location. As soon as the previous batch of vehicles arrives, they can immediately carry out operations simultaneously. When the shunting team is forming the next batch of vehicles, the inspection personnel carry out the technical inspection of the previous batch of vehicles, the commercial personnel carry out the commercial inspection, and the conductor carries out the general inspection. At this time, the stationmaster on duty can call the locomotive depot to let the locomotive leave the depot to attach to the train. After the previous batch of trains is formed, the inspection personnel, commercial personnel, and conductor have waited for the inspection of the next batch of vehicles. The station shunting team is already connecting the next batch of vehicles, and the locomotive from the locomotive depot is already doing the connecting and other operations for the previous batch of vehicles. At this time, the conductor quickly inspects the next batch of vehicles and goes to the technical room to receive the freight bill and the formation order list. After the second batch of vehicles separately test whether the braking device is good, the locomotive quickly pushes the next batch of vehicles to transfer to the departure line, connects with the previous batch of vehicles, and performs a full train brake test. In the past, it was necessary to wait until the entire train was formed before carrying out the preliminary inspection, which wasted more time than now. After the brake test, the two inspection teams did not help each other in the past, but now all the inspection personnel are simultaneously assigned to the front and rear ends for inspection. The front batch is responsible by the arrival car inspection team, and the rear batch is responsible by the departure car inspection team, which saves half the time compared to the past when the two inspection teams did not cooperate with each other. At this time, the conductor has walked from the technical room to the locomotive, contacted the driver, explained the train number, the weight carried by the train, the length of the train, the over-axle tonnage, and the departure time, so that the driver has a clear understanding. In this way, the on-site operation time for the entire formation of an over-length and over-weight train only takes 45 minutes, which can be successfully completed, saving one hour and fifteen minutes compared to the earlier time. At the same time, the train turnaround and locomotive utilization rate are greatly improved, so that the overall view of the joint labor system is thoroughly implemented from the command branch dispatching office to the very complex on-site operation of forming and dispatching trains.

    Why can complex technical departments cooperate so harmoniously and rhythmically in on-site production? This is because a "full house red" competition with an overall concept guides workers of different natures to strive for a unified goal of "full load, over axle, running 500, patriotic production increase full house red." This competition requires everyone to complete their production plan 100%, and everyone can get a red flag, so the competition itself is highly promoting the spirit of collectivism, unlike the past competitions, where individual achievements are often outstanding, but the overall performance is not very good. Therefore, it stipulates that in the competition unit, as long as one person gets a green flag, the other personnel complete the task 100%, this unit can still only get a green flag; in this way, the overall concept and mutual assistance spirit are strengthened. After the Shenyang Branch dispatching office launched this "full house red" competition, it further helped the Party organization consolidate the overall concept of the dispatching personnel ideologically. For example, dispatcher Yu Shaoxin did not complete the task on June 16, so he requested a review meeting that night to review the reasons why he could not complete the task, which was due to poor contact with all parties, and proposed a guarantee for future improvement. After the review meeting, Yu Shaoxin never failed to complete the task again. In this way, the "full house red" competition gradually spread from the command branch dispatching office to various sites, which enabled the various departments of the Shenyang Branch to cooperate closely with each other and carry out production more rhythmically and organized. In early July, the Shenyang Branch planned an average running distance of 498 kilometers per locomotive in 24 hours, and actually reached 527 kilometers, which was 18.9 kilometers faster than the 508.1 kilometers per locomotive in 24 hours in June. The number of 500-kilometer locomotives in the branch in early July accounted for 74.2% of the locomotives in use, which was an increase of 2.7% compared to the 71.5% of the locomotives in use in June. An average of 55 trains were pulled by each locomotive, which was three more trains than the average of 52 trains pulled by each locomotive in June. In early July, the average weight pulled by each locomotive according to the standard was 1,720 tons, but the actual weight pulled was 1,822 tons, exceeding the standard by 6%. In the first ten days of July, the Shenyang Branch exceeded 287,493.6 tons of axle load, and at the same time, the vehicle turnover rate was shortened from 1.26 days in June to 1.19 days, and the locomotive full turnover was shortened from 12.5 hours in June to 12.3 hours. This powerfully shows that because the Shenyang Branch has implemented the joint labor system and carried out production in a coordinated and rhythmic manner, the train turnover rate and locomotive utilization efficiency have been greatly improved at the same time. Therefore, the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement of the Shenyang Branch can be carried out normally and healthily on this consolidated basis. Therefore, the joint labor of the Shenyang Branch should become the direction for national railway enterprises to learn, not only the railway department, but the direction for all economic enterprise departments to learn, and become the direction of the efforts of the people across the country under the guidance of planned economy.

    协调地有节奏地进行生产的一个范例
    ——记中长路沈阳分局运输工作中的联合劳动制
    新华社记者  洪流
    铁路是一个极复杂的大生产的企业，如果把它比做一架机器，它是一架活跃祖国经济动脉的输血的联动机。当祖国经济建设高潮将要到来时，为推动铁路一切部门工作前进的满载、超轴、五百公里运动及时地在全国各地开展，这架输血的联动机的每一个齿轮更需要协调地、有节奏地迅速转动，如果一个齿轮有了阻滞，就会影响其他齿轮的转动，因此，它要求作为机器的主人的我国铁路工人高度发扬集体主义精神，不允许某一个铁路部门的人员有本位主义思想来妨碍整体。苏联专家在中长路已为我们在这方面做出了一个辉煌的榜样。七月一日，是沈阳分局开始实行紧密运行图的一天。这一天，全分局所属的员工兴奋地为他们生产改革上的一件重大的事情在欢欣鼓舞；他们为一个共同遵守的苏联专家具体指导下制订的分局货物列车紧密运行图而进行有节奏的生产。记者曾参观分局运输工作的指挥部分局调度所，看过这张学习了苏联先进经验制订的全体铁路人员都把它看作是国家法令的紧密运行图。这张紧密的列车运行图和机车运行图上有许多红色、黑色的线条和许多站名和车次的号码，他们用图表指示出机车要牵引的车次。这张紧密运行图的图表中有社会主义管理企业的显著特点——高度计划性和一切部门人员自觉地、协调地配合动作来同时缩短车辆周转和机车周转的时间。同时紧密运行图把工人所创造的新的生产定额，生产指标固定下来，从而又鼓励工人不断突破旧的生产定额，生产标准，创造新的生产定额，生产标准。这样反过来又帮助调度人员及时修订运行图，使各部门的行动更密切地配合。
    自从满载、超轴、五百公里运动在沈阳分局普遍开展后，工人们以创造的精神，大量超轴，打破了旧的生产定额、生产标准，创造了新的定额。苏联专家帮助调度所人员把工人们自己所创造的超轴牵引的新定额组织在紧密运行图里，具体规定大石桥至苏家屯站间的九六一次等三个列车编组加倍超轴，四平至苏家屯车站间也编组三个超轴列车，这样解决了沈阳分局目前来的车和去的车不平衡所造成的机车运用和车辆周转上的矛盾，并使大量超轴和快跑紧密的相结合。开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动后，调车人员学习了李锡奎先进的调车法，缩短了调车时间，商务人员学习了杨茂林装车法，提高了装载效率，列检人员使用了苏联什车布力金的不甩车检修的平行作业方法，缩短了列车检查时间，调度所人员就根据这些新的情况重新查定了列车运行时刻，减少了八个给水站的停车。这样，由于停站时间的减少，紧密运行图上规定的列车旅行速度（每小时）就比六月份的指标提高了三点六公里。由于列检人员的紧密配合，紧密运行图上规定列车在车站的检查时间就减少了六分钟，这样，紧密运行图把分局调度，车站、机务段、列检人员等有节奏地、协调地动作的成果巩固下来，同时，用紧密运行图推动各部门更密切地配合，为完成统一的运输任务，自觉地、协调地创造更大的成绩。
    为完成铁路各部门共同遵守的国家法令——紧密运行图，高度自觉的纪律性的大联合劳动，还必须有党组织的思想领导，劳动组织方面的固定班次，制度方面的联系合同，技术作业方面的统一平行作业法，劳动竞赛上的满堂红竞赛等来保证它。
    首先，沈阳分局的联合劳动制是经过了一段反对本位主义的激烈的思想斗争才获得胜利的。这个思想斗争先从分局调度所指挥部人员中间开始。早在一年前，苏联专家就把苏联先进经验古达芬、札果尔科和苏德尼果夫的调度工作法介绍给沈阳分局调度所的中国员工。这些先进的调度工作法都贯串着联合劳动的精神，特别是在一九五一年秋天所介绍的苏德尼果夫的调度工作法，更加强了行车调度和机车调度的紧密联合劳动。这一调度工作方法的特点，是行车调度不但掌握列车运行和车辆运用，并且掌握机车运用，同时提高机车、车辆运行效果。
    但是这些苏联的先进调度法在沈阳分局调度所执行时，曾遇到本位主义思想的阻碍，因此并未很快贯彻。由于行车调度主任只注意车辆周转得快，怕机车不够使用，例如实际仅需用二十台机车，却向机车调度主任说谎：“需要二十四台”，他们经常多要四台机车点火待用。等机车把煤上好、水添足，火升了几个钟头不见车站来要机车时，机车调度主任着急了，问行车调度：“怎么没用呢，机车早点火预备好了？”行车调度就和车站人员串通了哄骗机车调度主任说：“货没装出来。”或说：“外局列车未到，造成列车编不成，这台机车只好不使用了。”这样，就每天有四台机车白白地点了火在空等列车，给国家浪费了很大的煤、水和人力。同样，由于机车调度主任也存在本位主义思想，他慢慢怀疑行车调度主任所要的机车计划里有“空头”，他不采用正当的办法给行车调度主任提出意见，却串通了机务段人员共同谎骗行车调度主任说：“只有二十台机车能使用，其余的机车坏了，不能用。”他们想：“不管你有‘空头’，没‘空头’，反正我们机车少了，机车的运用效率高了，五百公里也能多跑呀。”这样，遇到货源旺盛时，车站真的把列车编组好了在等机车时，机车调度主任也仍是说：“机务段里没机车呀。”这就不仅使列车编好了发不出去，影响了列车周转时间，有时还造成车站列车满线的堵塞现象，使其他的列车不能及时通过，给国家造成了很大的损失。因之，由于分局调度所行车调度和机车调度的严重的本位主义思想，使苏联先进的调度法无法执行。一九五一年十一月，中国共产党沈阳分局机关总支为了保证贯彻加强行车调度和机车调度紧密联合劳动的苏德尼果夫调度法，开始把车、机两科组织党的支部把机车调度和行车调度合并组成一个党的小组，从党内展开批评与自我批评来彻底批判本位主义。行车调度主任孙仙材和机车调度主任李广祥都在党的小组会上深刻检讨了自己，并订出了改正的办法。在车站和机务段、车辆段之间，也都经过中国共产党地区党委会的帮助，从党内端正了整体观念思想。中国共产党苏家屯地区党委会帮助了苏家屯车辆段、机务段检讨了“过去没有认识到大家都在为国家的运输任务服务，而认为机务、车辆都在为车站服务，一见站长有‘本位’，自己也就不肯配合，拿国家的运输任务作儿戏。”大家又深刻的检讨出去年三、四月间由于机务、车辆、车站闹不团结，造成了苏家屯车站列车满线堵塞，列车只能在沈阳站、四平站编车，结果沈阳站、四平站也满了线，整个影响了沈阳分局的运输任务的完成，给国家造成巨大的损失。苏家屯地区各部门中国共产党的支部和其他地区中共党的组织都抓住了这个闹“本位”给国家造成巨大损失的活例进行整体观念的思想教育，这就有力地给沈阳分局运输工作中的联合劳动制打下了深厚的思想基础。
    沈阳分局的联合劳动制有了不断地反对本位主义的思想基础后，在劳动组织方面和制度方面也相适应地出现了固定班次制和保证联系合同彻底贯彻的联系制度。
    固定班次是从劳动组织上进一步来巩固大联合劳动，它使参加联合劳动的分局调度所行车调度员、调度主任，机车调度员、调度主任，车站值班站长，调度员，调车员，线路值班员，信号员，商务司磅员，机务段的值班员，调度员，捣站机车，车辆段的检车主任，值班员，检车员，列车段的值班车长在同一个时间交接班。这个部门轮到甲班值日，同一天里旁的部门也是甲班值日。这样，这个新的劳动组织的优越性充分说明了社会主义性企业的高度组织性，这些人员都固定地在同一天里当班，使大家都相互熟悉彼此了解性格、特点和工作能力，使分局行车调度员知道同一个时期内在车站、机务段、检车段上当班的人员的优缺点，这样又可以责任明确，联系方便，加上由于紧密运输图固定了机车交路（即机车到达目的地后，能及时牵引另一列车折返，不使机车停留时间过长），固定了车次，使分局调度员能同时了解司机和列车人员的特点。这样做就能使铁路各部门的工作人员在为完成一个统一的目标中，更协调地有节奏地进行工作。
    各部门订立联系合同使沈阳分局运输工作中的联合劳动制有了丰富的内容，并用明确的条文表现出来。这个群众自愿相互订立的反对本位主义的联系合同，使联合劳动的彻底的贯彻，有了群众性的监督和保证。在苏家屯车站和苏家屯车辆段订立的联系合同中，规定车站向车辆段保证及时将要检修的车辆（即红票车）按指定线送入。过去车站犯本位主义，不及时将要检修的车辆送往车辆段，使车辆段工人上班后没活干，等大批需检修的车辆一起送入车辆段时，检车工人又加开夜班也作不完活。现在，这种不合理现象已没有了。车辆段也对车站保证“如遇直达列车时在不妨碍安全情形下不扣红票车”，这也是为了克服车辆段过去曾犯过的乱扣
    “红票车”使直达列车不能按时开出的本位主义现象而订立的。这样，联系合同又从制度上帮助员工巩固整体观点思想。
    为了保证联系合同的贯彻执行，和固定班次的作用更好发挥，分局所属的站、段又把每天当班的人员，编为一个小组，组长由车站调度员担任，并制定了联系制度和会议制度。车站调度员接班后向分局调度了解班计划后，立刻传达给各部门去及时做准备工作。他又每三小时向各部门联系一次。并在每日交班后和各部门召开碰头会，或用电话联系来总结当天工作中的优缺点，随时改正缺点。
    有了劳动组织上的固定班次和制度上的联系合同、联系制度后，保证联合劳动制贯彻到具体作业方面，还须要创造一套新的作业方法。苏联专家又帮助沈阳分局所属的车站创造了“统一平行作业法”。“统一平行作业法”把联合劳动制的优越性集中地表现出在现场作业上，他突出地表现了社会主义性企业的高度组织性和他的各部门紧密配合有节奏地进行生产的这个显著特点：这个作业方法是每一趟列车分前后两节进行工作，在前一批车辆等车号员抄完车号转至发车线时，车辆段的检车小组，商务方面的司磅员，列车段的车长已提前在所指定的地点准备好了，等前一批车辆一到，他们就能立即同时进行作业了。当调车组进行编组后一批车辆时，检车人员就进行前一批车辆的技术检查，商务人员进行商务检查，车长进行总的检查，而值班站长就可在此时打电话给机务段让机车出库来挂车，在前一批列车编完后，检查人员，商务人员，车长已等候后一批车辆的检查了。车站调车组已在为后
    一批车辆连挂，机务段来的机车已在为前一批车辆做连挂等作业。这时车长迅速将后一批车辆检查完去技术室接受货票和编组顺序单。等第二批车辆分别试验制动装置是否良好后，机车赶紧推送后一批车辆转线至发车线，和前一批车辆连结，进行全列车的试闸。过去都必须等全列车编组好后，再进行初步检查，就比现在浪费时间。在试闸后，过去两个检车组人员互不帮助，而现在全部检车人员，同时分配到前后两头进行检查，前头这一批由到达车检车组负责，后头一批由发车检车组负责，这就要比过去两个检车组互相不配合能节省出一半的时间来。这时，车长已从技术室走向机车，和司机联系，说明车次，列车所载重量，列车长度，超轴吨数，发车时间，使司机心中有数。这样，整个编组超长超重列车的现场作业时间仅需四十五分钟，就能胜利地完成，比早先要节省一点十五分钟，同时使列车周转和机车运用率都大大提高，使联合劳动制的整体观点从指挥部分局调度所深入地贯彻到作业非常复杂的编发列车现场。
    为什么能使复杂的技术部门在现场配合得这样协调地有节奏地进行生产呢？这是由于有了一个整体观念的满堂红竞赛把各个性质不相同的工作人员，引导到为完成一个共同奋斗的“满载、超轴、跑五百，爱国增产满堂红”的统一的目标上来，这个竞赛是要求每一个人都能百分之百地完成自己的生产计划，每个人都能得到红旗，所以这个竞赛的本身就是高度发扬集体主义精神的，不像过去的竞赛，往往是个人成绩突出，整体的成绩反而不很好，所以它规定在竞赛的单位里，只要有一个人得绿旗，其他人员百分之百地完成任务，这个单位也仍是只能得绿旗；这样，就加强了整体观念和互助精神。沈阳分局调度所开展了这个满堂红竞赛后，它又进
    一步帮助了党的组织在思想上巩固了调度人员的整体观念。如于绍新调度员在六月十六日那天没有完成任务，他就当天晚上要求召开了检讨会，检讨自己完不成任务的原因是与各方面联系的不好，提出今后改进的保证。检讨会后，于绍新就一直再没有完不成任务过。这样，满堂红竞赛从指挥部分局调度所逐渐普及到各现场去，这就使沈阳分局的各个部门紧密地相互配合，更有节奏地有组织地进行生产。七月上旬，沈阳分局计划每台机车二十四小时平均走行四百九十八公里，实际达到五百二十七公里，比六月份每台机车二十四小时走行五百零八点
    一公里，加速了十八点九公里。七月上旬的分局的跑五百公里机车的台数已占运用机车的百分之七十四点二，比六月份的占运用机车台数的百分之七十一点五要增加百分之二点七。平均每台机车牵引五十五辆列车，比六月份每台机车平均牵引五十二辆列车，要多牵引三辆车。七月上旬按标准每台机车平均牵引的重量为一千七百二十吨，实际却牵引了
    一千八百二十二吨，超过标准百分之六。七月上旬十天内，沈阳分局共超轴二十八万七千四百九十三点六吨，同时又使车辆周转率从六月份的一点二六天缩短到一点一九天，机车全周转从六月份的十二点五小时缩短到十二点三小时，这就有力地说明了由于沈阳分局贯彻了联合劳动制，协调地有节奏地进行生产，使列车周转率和机车运用效率同时获得大大提高，因而沈阳分局的满载、超轴、五百公里运动也就能在这种巩固的基础上正常地健康地开展。因此，沈阳分局的这个联合劳动应成为全国铁路企业学习的方向，不仅是铁路部门，而是所有经济企业部门学习的方向，并成为全国人民在计划经济指导下的努力的方向。
