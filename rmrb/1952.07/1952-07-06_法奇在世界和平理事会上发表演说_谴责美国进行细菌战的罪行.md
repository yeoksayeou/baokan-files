Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: At the afternoon session on July 3rd of the World Peace Council's special meeting, Fage delivered a speech addressing the germ warfare in Korea and its international impact. He also reported to the meeting on the extensive evidence he collected during his visit to China and Korea in the spring of this year.

Fage said: "From April 28th to June 16th, I carefully studied the facts, collected and verified the evidence, and interviewed witnesses, confirming on the spot all facts that seemed unclear, abnormal, or too shocking."

Fage emphasized that, since he himself was not an expert in this field, he extensively utilized the consultation and assistance of prominent Chinese scientists. Many of these scientists are world-renowned, such as Professor Chen Wengui and Dr. Wei Xi.

He continued: "What I now want to report to the World Peace Council is a portion of the evidence I have collected in order to present a report to the public opinion of all countries. The facts I cite are all derived from the evidence I collected to affirm the need to defend the people of both countries from the disasters of germ offensive."

"I will explain the reasons that led me to take a clear stance on this issue. I will base my report on the following premises:

A plan for germ warfare, prepared in advance and thoroughly planned, definitely existed. This plan was exposed during the course of the germ warfare.

Some major stages in the development of germ warfare are consistent with the military and scientific data published in American books, magazines, newspapers, and reports.

The conclusions reached by experts in laboratories in Korea and China are consistent with the testimonies of prisoners of war, even though sometimes such testimonies are not entirely scientific.

Germ warfare must be seen as a link in a chain of atrocities and crimes. These atrocities and crimes may develop to the use of atomic bombs. It is known that these atomic bomb storage sites are close to the war zone."

Fage detailed how he conducted the investigation and what methods he used to gather the necessary intelligence about the Americans' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. Fage said: "In one laboratory I visited, there was a map of Korea with 340 markers on it. These markers were scattered throughout North Korea, but were particularly dense near residential areas, railway junctions, and water sources. These markers indicated the places subjected to American air force germ bombings. A cursory review of this map and some of the evidence makes it possible to conclude that in all these areas, intestinal diseases were prevalent, caused by germ-carrying insects or poisons dropped near pools or rivers.

In addition, there are records of respiratory diseases and plague caused by insects and objects dropped from airplanes. The spread of bacteria at railway junctions and on roads was particularly frequent, and even jet aircraft were used for this purpose."

Fage then spoke of the destructive bombing of Pyongyang by the U.S. Air Force. Many victims of these bombings were peaceful residents—women, children, and the elderly. Today, Pyongyang, like other residential areas in Korea, is completely reduced to rubble. Fage said: "In my opinion, the destruction of Pyongyang is an example of the barbarism of the Pentagon, just as the destruction of Warsaw is evidence of the barbarism of Hitler."

Fage expressed respect for the courage and heroic deeds of the Korean people, saying: "Unable to destroy and frustrate the will of the Korean people in the air, the U.S. Air Force attempted to continue its destructive work with germ weapons, because germ weapons can infiltrate underground and into the ruins."

Fage cited the testimonies of Koreans who had personally witnessed American pilots dropping germ bombs over Korea, and quoted many documents related to germ warfare, including excerpts from American newspaper articles.

Fage pointed out that he could supplement the documents he cited with the testimonies of American prisoners of war, especially the testimony of pilot John Quinn.

Fage said that the World Peace Council must pass a resolution addressed to the American people, because in the United States "there are hundreds and thousands of John Quinns who can hear our call."

Fage said that Korea is very close to us. Those who hold a skeptical attitude should not forget that those who studied the methods of conducting germ warfare with American generals included not only Japanese experts proficient in this crime, but also former Nazis, especially a former Nazi named Walter Schreiber, who currently works in Texas in the United States.

Fage finally requested that the documents and testimonies he brought back from Korea be made known as widely as possible to all people who wish to maintain human dignity.

### 法奇在世界和平理事会上发表演说  谴责美国进行细菌战的罪行

    法奇在世界和平理事会上发表演说
    谴责美国进行细菌战的罪行
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：在世界和平理事会特别会议三日下午会议上，法奇发表演说论及朝鲜的细菌战争及这一战争的国际影响，并向会议报告了今年春天他在访问中国和朝鲜期间搜集到的广泛的证据。
    法奇说：从四月二十八日到六月十六日，我仔细地研究了事实，搜集、核对了证据，并和证人面谈，当场证实了一切看起来不清楚、不正常或者过于骇人听闻的事实。
    法奇着重指出，由于他本人在这方面不是一个专家，他广泛利用了中国著名科学家的咨询和协助。这些科学家中间有许多是世界闻名的，例如陈文贵教授和魏曦博士等。
    他又说：我现在要向世界和平理事会报告的是我为了向一切国家的舆论提出报告而搜集到的证据的一部分。我所援引的事实都是从我为了肯定必须保卫两国人民，使他们不受细菌攻势的灾害而搜集的证据中得来的。
    我将说明使我在这个问题上采取鲜明立场的理由，我将从下面的前提出发来作我的报告，这些前提就是：
    确乎存在一个事先拟就并经过通盘筹划准备进行细菌战的计划。这个计划在细菌战的过程中间被揭露出来。
    细菌战发展过程的一些主要阶段，是和美国销行的书籍、杂志、报纸和报告里面发表的军事和科学资料相符合的。
    朝鲜和中国的实验室里面的专家们所得到的结论，是和战俘们的作证相符合的，虽然有时这种作证并不是完全合乎科学的。
    必须把细菌战看作一连串暴行和罪行中的一个环节。这些暴行和罪行可能发展到使用原子弹。大家知道，这些原子弹的贮存处所是接近战区的。
    法奇详述他如何进行调查以及他使用了什么方法来搜集关于美国人在朝鲜使用细菌武器的必要情报。法奇说：在我访问的一个实验室里，挂着一张朝鲜地图，上面有着三百四十个标志。这些标志遍布北朝鲜全境，但是在居民区、铁路连结点和水源等附近特别稠密。这些标志指明了受到美国空军细菌轰炸的地方。粗略地审查一下这张地图和一些证据，使人有可能得出下面的结论：在所有这些地区，肠病都在流行，这些肠病是在水池或河流附近投掷的带菌毒虫或毒物所引起的。
    此外并记载有呼吸器官方面的疾病，以及飞机上投掷下来的昆虫和物件所引起的鼠疫。特别频繁的是在铁路连结点和公路上散布细菌，甚至喷气飞机也用来从事这种工作。
    法奇其次谈到美国空军对平壤的破坏性轰炸。这些轰炸的许多受难者是和平居民——妇女、儿童和老年人。今天平壤已像朝鲜其他的居民区一样完全是断垣残瓦。法奇说：在我看来，平壤的破坏是五角大楼野蛮主义的一个例子，正如华沙的破坏是希特勒野蛮主义的证据一样。
    法奇对朝鲜人民的勇气和英雄业迹表示敬意，他说：美国空军在空中不能摧毁和挫折朝鲜人民的意志，便企图用细菌武器来继续它的破坏工作，因为细菌武器能够潜入地下，潜入废墟之中。
    法奇引述亲眼看到美国飞行员在朝鲜上空投掷细菌弹的朝鲜人的证词，并引述有关细菌战的许多文件，包括美国报纸文章的节录。
    法奇指出：他可以用美国战俘的证词，特别是飞行员约翰·奎恩的证词来补充他所引述的文件。
    法奇说，世界和平理事会必须通过一个告美国人民的决议，因为在美国“有成千成百的约翰·奎恩能够听到我们的呼声”。
    法奇说，朝鲜与我们近在咫尺。那些抱着怀疑态度的人不应忘了与美国将领一同研究进行细菌战方法的不仅有擅长这种罪行的日本专家，并且有前纳粹分子，特别是一个名叫华德·施莱勃的前纳粹分子，他目前在美国得克萨斯州工作。
    法奇最后要求把他从朝鲜带回来的文件和证词，尽可能普遍地让希望保持人类尊严的所有人们知道。
