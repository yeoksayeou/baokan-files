Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 27th: After the plenary session of the delegation of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations entered public discussion on the 26th, the US representative once again unilaterally adjourned the meeting for seven days on the first day of the public meeting and left the venue midway. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, sent a letter to the US chief representative, Major General Harrison, on the 27th, protesting the other side's blatant act of deliberately delaying the negotiations, pointing out that the other side's habitual trick of absenting themselves from meetings cannot cover up the fact that their actions and proposals of mistreating and detaining prisoners of war are a complete violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. The other side must bear all responsibility for delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. The full text of General Nam Il's letter to the other side is as follows:
Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

    The only obstacle currently hindering the Korean armistice is the issue of prisoners of war, and the issue of prisoners of war is actually only a matter of the principle and number of repatriation that have not yet been agreed upon. If your side has the sincerity to quickly reach a Korean armistice, your side has no reason to refuse to work with our side to spare no effort to seek a fair and reasonable solution. However, your side insisted on your unilateral and unreasonable demands in the administrative meeting of the plenary session of the two delegations, and even refused to conduct any discussion, making the administrative meeting lose any function. And on the first day that your side agreed to the plenary session of the two delegations entering public meetings, you unilaterally decided to adjourn the meeting for seven days and left the venue midway without waiting for our side to speak. This makes people doubt whether your side has the sincerity to reach a Korean armistice.

    Our side has always maintained that all issues in the Korean armistice negotiations must be resolved fairly through consultation between the two sides on a reasonable basis. In order to resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, our side made another major effort in the most recent administrative meeting. Our side suggested that, according to the principles of Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement that have already been agreed upon by both sides, the prisoners of war should be reclassified according to their nationality and place of residence, and the list of prisoners of war exchanged by both sides on December 18, 1951, should be corrected accordingly. Our side believes that since both sides have agreed to the principle that prisoners of war of both sides should no longer participate in the Korean War so that they can go home and live a peaceful life, only Korean prisoners of war whose homes are in the area held by the receiving side can be allowed to return home locally without repatriation. And foreign prisoners of war held by both sides, that is, captured personnel of the United Nations forces or captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, have no reason not to be fully repatriated. Therefore, our side maintains that your side's revised list should be a realistic number, that is, close to 116,000, including 20,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. And 116,000 is the approximate number of prisoners of war that your side has publicly acknowledged should be repatriated to our side.

    Regarding the issue of prisoners of war, there is only one universally recognized international convention in the world, namely the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. Any dispute regarding the issue of prisoners of war can only be reasonably resolved on the basis of this universally recognized international convention. The fact that our side gave humane treatment to prisoners of war during the war and the proposal to fully repatriate prisoners of war home to live a peaceful life after the armistice are fully in line with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, while your side's actions and proposals on the issue of prisoners of war are a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. The 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war must be given humane treatment, but your side openly massacres prisoners of war, and no amount of sophistry can say that the fact of massacring prisoners of war is in line with the Geneva Convention. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention strictly stipulates that the warring parties must repatriate the prisoners of war they hold after the armistice, based on the basic fact that prisoners of war are in the situation of being captured by the opposing party, which is clear, unambiguous and absolutely not allowed to be distorted, but your side openly insists on arbitrarily detaining prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called non-forcible repatriation. Your side's proposal to detain prisoners of war is inherently unreasonable, but your side mistakenly treats unreasonableness as strength, attempting to force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable proposal by not holding meetings and being unreasonable.

    I must frankly tell you that the vast majority of people in the world are reasonable. Your side's attempt to escape the light of truth by escaping meetings is not going to work. Your side must be reasonable at the meeting table of the Korean armistice negotiations. No matter how barbaric and unreasonable your actions are, they cannot force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable proposals. The issue of repatriation of prisoners of war must be resolved through consultation between the two sides on the basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention. The people of the world yearn for a Korean armistice. Unless your side's purpose is to deliberately prolong the bloodshed in Korea, your side has no reason to refuse to come to the meeting and work with our side to seek a fair and reasonable solution to this only problem hindering the armistice. If your side disregards the ardent hopes of the people of the world and decides to unilaterally adjourn the meeting for seven days, your side must bear all responsibility for delaying the Korean armistice negotiations.

General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation
July 27, 1952

    The staff meeting between the two sides continued to discuss the textual details of the draft armistice agreement on the 27th.

### 南日将军致函美方代表哈利逊  抗议美方无理逃会蓄意拖延谈判

    南日将军致函美方代表哈利逊
    抗议美方无理逃会蓄意拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会在二十六日进入公开讨论后，美方代表在公开会议的第一天就再次片面休会七天，中途离开会场。我方首席代表南日将军在二十七日致函美方首席代表哈利逊少将，抗议对方这一蓄意拖延谈判的横暴行为，指出对方这种逃会的惯技决不能掩盖对方虐杀战俘和扣留战俘的行为与主张是彻底违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约的。对方必须担负拖延朝鲜停战谈判的一切责任。南日将军致对方信件的全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    目前阻碍着朝鲜停战的只有一个战俘问题，而战俘问题实际上只有一个遣俘的原则和数字问题尚未达成协议。如果你方有迅速达成朝鲜停战的诚意，你方就没有任何理由拒绝和我方一起共同努力不遗余力地寻求公平合理的解决之道。但你方在双方代表团大会行政性会议中坚持你方片面无理要求，甚至拒绝进行任何讨论，使行政性会议失去任何作用。而在你方同意双方代表团大会进入公开会议的第一天，就片面决定休会七天，并且未等我方发言即中途离开会场。这就使人们怀疑你方究竟有无达成朝鲜停战的诚意。
    我方素来主张朝鲜停战谈判中的所有问题都必须在合理的基础上经由双方协商求得公平的解决。为了解决遣俘问题，我方在最近一次的行政性会议中，作了又一次的重大努力。我方建议根据停战协定草案中双方已经同意的第五十一款和第五十二款的原则，按照战俘的国籍和住地重新进行分类，并据此校正一九五一年十二月十八日双方所交换的战俘名单。我方认为既然双方同意了双方战俘不再参加朝鲜战争以便回家过和平生活的原则，只有朝鲜籍战俘中家在收容一方地区者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。而双方所收容的外国籍战俘，即联合国军被俘人员，或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，则没有任何理由不予全部遣返。因此，我方主张你方重新校正的名单应该是一个切合实际的即接近十一万六千包含两万名中国人民志愿军被俘人员在内的数字。而十一万六千人正是你方曾经公开承认应予遣返我方的战俘的接近数字。
    关于战俘问题，世界上只有一个公认的国际公约，即一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约。任何有关战俘问题的争执，只有在这个公认的国际公约的基础上才能求得合理的解决。我方在战时给战俘以人道待遇的事实，及在停战后全部遣返战俘回家过和平生活的主张是完全符合于一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定的，而你方在战俘问题上的行动和主张则完全违背了日内瓦公约。一九四九年日内瓦公约明确规定，必须予战俘以人道待遇，但你方公然屠杀战俘，任何诡辩都不能把屠杀战俘的事实说成是符合日内瓦公约的。日内瓦公约第一一八条，根据战俘系处于被敌对一方俘掳的状况之下的基本事实，严格规定交战双方在停战后必须遣返其所收容的战俘，这本是明白无误、绝对不容曲解的，但你方竟公然藉口所谓不得强迫遣返，坚持任意扣留战俘。你方扣留战俘的主张本来是没有任何道理的，但你方错误地把不讲理当作力量，企图用不开会、不讲理的办法来强使我方接受你方片面无理主张。
    我必须坦白告诉你，全世界绝大多数的人是讲理的。你方企图用逃会的办法来逃避真理的光芒是不行的。你方在朝鲜停战谈判的会议桌上必须讲理。你方任何横蛮无理的行动都不能强使我方接受你方片面无理的主张。遣俘问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的基础上经由双方协商求得解决。世界人民渴望朝鲜停战，除非你方的目的是蓄意延长朝鲜的流血，你方没有任何理由拒绝前来开会和我方一起共同努力寻求这个阻碍着停战的唯一问题的公平合理的解决。如果你方竟然不顾世界人民的热望，决心片面休会七天，你方必须负起拖延朝鲜停战谈判的一切责任。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军一九五二年七月二十七日
    双方参谋人员会议，在二十七日对停战协定草案的文字细节，继续进行讨论。
