    Self-Criticism on Neglecting Workers' Cadre Studies
    Comrade Editor: People's Daily published letters from model workers Dong Zhenyuan and Liu Lifu on May 15th, criticizing us for not paying enough attention to the study of worker cadres, which is correct.
    Here is a report on our improvements to this work: We started a professional study class on May 23rd, stipulating six hours of study per week, with administrative cadres and Soviet comrades giving lectures. We have already given seven lessons. Regarding the issue of meeting and after-work study time, we have resolved it since early May. During evening free time, we organize various activities. Tuesdays and Thursdays are for cultural studies, Mondays are for technical studies, and Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are for political education for the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. At the same time, we also stipulate a one-hour lunch break. In the future, we will definitely listen to comrades' opinions better and deal with problems in a timely manner.

    Self-Criticism on the Mistake of Reducing Newspaper Subscriptions
    Comrade Editor: On May 15th, the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published a letter from model worker Sun Xiaoju, pointing out that our bureau should not have reduced its subscription to the People's Daily. We believe this criticism is correct. In the past, each of our sections subscribed to the Northeast Daily, People's Railway, Heilongjiang Daily, and Locomotive. We felt that the Northeast Daily frequently reprinted editorials and other articles from the People's Daily, so we only subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily for the director's office, and other sections did not subscribe. This was a manifestation of our incorrect viewpoint. Since June 1st, we have increased our subscriptions to the People's Daily and Worker's Daily from the post office in order to distribute them to various sections for reading.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对不重视工人干部学习的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十五日刊载了劳动模范董振远、刘立富的来信，对我们不重视工人干部学习提出批评，这是正确的。
    现在把我们改进这一工作的情况报告如下：我们从五月二十三日开始组织了业务学习班，规定每星期学习六小时，有行政干部和苏联同志讲课，现已讲了七课。关于会议和业余学习时间的问题，从五月初我们已解决了。在晚上自由活动时间，我们组织了各种活动，每星期二和星期四是文化学习，星期一是技术学习，星期三、星期五、星期六是党、行政、工会、青年团的政治教育时间。同时，中午我们也规定午休一小时。今后我们一定更好地听取同志们的意见，做到有问题就及时处理。

    检讨减订报纸的错误
    编辑同志：五月十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了劳动模范孙孝菊同志的来信，指出我局不应该减订人民日报，我们认为这个批评是正确的。过去我们每科都订有东北日报、人民铁道报、黑龙江日报、火车头报，我们觉得东北日报经常转载人民日报社论和其他文章，所以我们只给局长室订了一份人民日报，其他各科都没有订。这是我们观点不正确的表现。我们自六月一日起，已经向邮局增订了人民日报和工人日报，以便分发各科阅读。
