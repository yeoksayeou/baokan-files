Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 3rd: At the July 1st plenary session of the Korean armistice talks, the other party expressed its willingness to "sincerely seek an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea," acknowledged that a solution to the POW repatriation issue "must be a solution that reasonably satisfies both sides' requirements," and expressed willingness to reach a reasonable agreement on the POW repatriation issue based on Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement. The meeting was adjourned for one day on the 2nd. At the meeting on the 3rd, our chief representative General Nam Il welcomed the other side's attitude of willingness to negotiate as expressed in their speech on July 1st, and pointed out that the lack of progress in the negotiations over the past two months was entirely due to the other side's refusal to reason and negotiate. General Nam Il formally proposed that, based on the principles stipulated in Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, prisoners of war on both sides should be reclassified and lists corrected according to nationality and region, in order to facilitate the repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives. He also proposed that the plenary session of the delegations of both sides enter into administrative meetings so that both sides could practically discuss this proposal. The other side, in order to study our side's statement, suggested adjourning the meeting until 11:00 a.m. on the 4th. The full text of General Nam Il's speech is as follows:

　　For two months, negotiations have made no progress because your side has refused to reason and negotiate. Your side's speech on July 1st changed your side's attitude over the past two months, expressing a willingness to seek "a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides" on the only remaining issue of POW repatriation in the Korean armistice negotiations. Our side welcomes this attitude of consultation. Your side said: "Let us examine Article 51, which basically says, and I quote: 'All prisoners of war held by each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as practicable consistent with this Armistice Agreement so that their return to their homelands is expedited. Such release and repatriation of prisoners of war shall be effected in conformity with the provisions of this Armistice Agreement.' This wording is consistent with your principle of exchanging prisoners of war as soon as the armistice is signed. It seems that this provision in this historical document is acceptable to both parties, although we would prefer a rather different wording." The provisions of Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement were originally negotiated by both parties. We not only agree with this principle, but also agree with this article. The focus of the debate for the past two months has not been on this principle, but on the fact that the results of your side's correction of the list do not conform to this principle agreed upon by both parties. We have always believed that since, in accordance with the provisions of Article 52, both parties guarantee that prisoners of war will not participate in the Korean War again after being repatriated, prisoners of war held by both parties "should only be allowed to return home to live peaceful lives." Therefore, prisoners of war on both sides must be reclassified and lists corrected according to nationality and region to facilitate the full repatriation stipulated in Article 51. That is to say, all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, namely UN forces or captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be repatriated home; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, namely South Korean army or Korean People's Army captured personnel, whose homes are in the original side's area, should be repatriated home; and those whose homes are in the area of the detaining side may be allowed to return home locally and need not be repatriated. Now that your side admits that exchanging prisoners of war on both sides so that they can "return home to live peaceful lives" is "a rational and humane act that reflects the credibility of both sides," then we have even more reason to propose reclassification and correction of lists in accordance with the principles stipulated in Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement. If your side agrees to our proposal so that a "reasonable" agreement can be reached on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, we are deeply convinced that the Korean armistice can come without delay. To facilitate practical discussion of this proposal, our side proposes that the plenary session of the delegations of both sides enter into administrative meetings starting on July 4th.

    三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我方提出遣返战俘建议
    【新华社开城三日电】七月一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方表示愿意“诚意地觅求停战，以终止朝鲜的流血”，承认解决战俘遣返问题的方案“必须是一个在合理的程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，并表示愿意根据停战协定草案第五十一款对战俘遣返问题达成一个通情合理的协议。二日大会休会一天。我方首席代表南日将军在三日会上对于对方在七月一日的发言中所表示的愿意进行协商的态度表示欢迎，并指出两个月来谈判毫无进展完全是由于对方拒绝说理，拒绝协商。南日将军正式建议根据停战协定第五十一款和第五十二款所规定的原则，对双方战俘依照国籍和地区进行重新分类，校正名单，以便于遣返双方战俘回家过和平生活，并提议双方代表团大会进入行政性会议，以便双方切实商讨这一建议。对方为研究我方发言，建议休会到四日上午十一时。南日将军发言全文如下：
    两个月来，由于你方拒绝说理，拒绝协商，致使谈判毫无进展。七月一日你方的发言，改变了你方两个月来的态度，表示愿意在朝鲜停战谈判中唯一剩余的战俘遣返问题上寻求“一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”。我方对于这种协商态度表示欢迎。你方说：“让我们检查一下第五十一款，它基本上是这样说的，我来引证：‘本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返，此项战俘的释放与遣返须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之’，这些措辞是符合于你们一俟停战签字即行交换战俘的原则的。看起来在这一历史性的文件中的这一项的措辞是双方所能同意的，虽然我们宁愿一个相当不同的措辞。”本来停战协定草案第五十一款的条文是经过双方协商的，我们不但同意这一原则，而且同意这一条文。两个月来争论的焦点不在于这一原则，而在于你方校正名单的结果不符合于双方同意了的这一原则。我们历来认为既然依照第五十二款的规定，双方保证战俘被遣返后不得再参加朝鲜战争，双方收容的战俘就只“应被允许回家过和平生活”，因此双方战俘必须依照国籍和地区重新分类，校正名单，以利于第五十一款所规定的全部遣返，这就是说双方所俘获的外国武装人员即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员全部遣返回家，双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，其家在原属一方地区者全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。现在你方既然承认交换双方战俘，使之“回家过和平生活”是“一个反映双方信誉的理智的与人道的行为”，那我们就更有理由提议根据停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款所规定的原则重新进行分类，校正名单。如果你方同意我方这一建议，使交换战俘的问题得以达成“通情合理”的协议，我方深信朝鲜停战就可不迟延地到来。为便利于切实商讨这一建议，我方提议自七月四日起，双方代表团大会进入行政性会议。
