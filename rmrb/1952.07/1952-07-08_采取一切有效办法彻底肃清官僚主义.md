A Short Review of Political and Legal Work

    The incident of Liao Zhongyi, a salesman of the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, who was framed by corrupt elements after reporting them, is a serious incident similar in nature to the "Ji Kaifu incident" in Wuhan, which was published in this newspaper on February 26th of this year. This incident not only exposed that a group of evil elements are indeed lurking in the revolutionary ranks, but more importantly, it exposed that many leading organs have extremely serious bureaucratic styles of work, creating many opportunities for bad elements to take advantage of.

    Shao Xi and Li Lai Tang's acts of corruption were exposed by Liao Zhongyi as early as February of last year and were affirmed by Dong Jinzhang of the Personnel Section of the Commercial Department. At that time, Dong Jinzhang even asked Liao Zhongyi to "continue collecting materials" and report to the higher authorities. However, when Shao Xi, Li Lai Tang, and others colluded with private merchants, falsely accusing Liao Zhongyi's responsible behavior of continuing to collect materials as "illegally auditing accounts and disrupting social order," and arbitrarily labeling Liao Zhongyi with the hat of "having serious political problems" and arresting him, the Commercial Department remained silent and allowed Liao Zhongyi to be imprisoned and controlled for as long as half a year. When the Nan Zheng Daily forwarded Liao Zhongyi's letter of accusation, their response was exactly the same as Shao Xi's and others': "Liao Zhongyi has political problems." Obviously, after discovering and affirming that Shao Xi and others "must be corrupt," the Commercial Department's attitude was to ignore it and let it go; when the whistleblower was severely persecuted, they also ignored it. The Shanxi Provincial Public Security Department's handling of Liao Zhongyi was to throw him into prison, handcuff him, and detain him for one hundred and thirty days without asking right from wrong; if Liao Zhongyi did not pursue the matter, they would not ask about it. After affirming that Liao Zhongyi "had no major faults," the Shanxi Public Security Department did not investigate why Liao Zhongyi was thrown into prison; instead, they made mistake after mistake and recklessly ordered the police station to place Liao Zhongyi under control for fifty-nine days. If it is said that these reckless acts were all done by the corrupt and lawless element Zhi Peijie alone, then what were Zhi Peijie's superiors doing? If they can ignore such things, what else should they be in charge of?

    Judging from the many facts revealed since the "Three-Anti" movement, if we do not take all effective measures (including legal sanctions) to eliminate this bureaucratic style of work, similar painful incidents may continue to occur in the future, causing us unpredictable losses in politics and work, and the construction work of our country will be difficult to carry out smoothly. Therefore, we fully agree with the practice of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government: thoroughly investigate this incident and instruct the leading cadres and staff of relevant organs to thoroughly examine and eliminate the bureaucratic style of work. Not only should Shanxi Province do this, but other places where such incidents have occurred should also do this. Only in this way can we effectively eliminate the bureaucratic style of work and ensure the smooth progress of the national construction cause.

### 采取一切有效办法彻底肃清官僚主义

    采取一切有效办法彻底肃清官僚主义
    中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司业务员廖中一检举贪污分子反被贪污分子陷害的事件，是和本报今年二月二十六日发表的武汉市“纪凯夫事件”性质相类似的严重事件。这一事件不仅暴露了在革命阵营中的确潜藏着一部分为非作恶的坏分子，更重要的是暴露了许多领导机关有着极端严重的官僚主义作风，给坏分子们造成了许多可乘之隙。
    邵熙和李来堂等的贪污行为，远在去年二月就为廖中一所揭发，并且为商业厅人事科的董锦章所肯定。当时董锦章还让廖中一“继续收集材料”，报告上级。但是，当邵熙、李来堂等勾结私商，把廖中一继续收集材料的负责行为诬为“非法查账，捣乱社会秩序”，并随意给廖中一戴上“有严重政治问题”的帽子而逮捕入狱时，商业厅却一声不响，听任廖中一被监禁、管制达半年之久。当南郑日报转来廖中一的控诉书时，他们的回答仍和邵熙等一模一样：“廖中一有政治问题”。显然，商业厅在发现和肯定了邵熙等“必有贪污”之后，所采取的态度就是不闻不问，听之任之；检举者受到了严重的迫害，他们也置之不理。山西省公安厅对于廖中一的处理，则是不问青红皂白，押入监狱，戴上手铐，一押就是一百三十天，廖中一不追，就不问。而在肯定廖中一“无好大过失”以后，山西公安厅也不去查究廖中一为什么会被投进监狱；竟一错再错，又肆无忌惮地命令派出所把廖中一管制了五十九天。如果说这些胡作非为都是贪赃枉法分子智培杰一人干的，那么智培杰的上级是干什么的呢？如果这样的事他们都可以不管，还有什么事情是他们应该管的呢？
    从“三反”运动以来揭发的许多事实来看，我们这种官僚主义作风，如果不采取一切有效的办法（包括法律制裁）加以肃清，将来还可能有类似的痛心事件继续发生，使我们在政治上和工作上继续遭受难于逆料的损失，我们国家的建设工作也将难于顺利进行。因此，我们完全同意山西省人民政府的作法：彻查这一事件，并责成有关机关领导干部和工作人员彻底检查和肃清官僚主义作风。不仅山西省应该这样做，凡是发生这类事件的其他地方也应该这样做。只有这样，我们才能有效地肃清官僚主义作风，保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。
