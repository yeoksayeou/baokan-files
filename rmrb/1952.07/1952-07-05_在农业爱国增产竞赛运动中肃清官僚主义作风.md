    Eliminate Bureaucratic Work Style in the Patriotic Agricultural Production Increase Campaign

    Generally speaking, regions where the patriotic agricultural production increase campaign is progressing well are showing a new atmosphere. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations have developed, technical guidance has been strengthened, water conservancy and fertilizer have increased, cultivation levels have improved, and political and ideological education has been closely integrated with production movements. This is an encouraging phenomenon. However, we must not be satisfied with the achievements already made. In some areas, bureaucratic and formalistic work styles have been discovered in the patriotic agricultural production increase campaign; this phenomenon must be corrected and prevented.

    The Yanbei District Committee Working Group of the Communist Party of China, Chahar Province, conducted an inspection of a "high-yield village" in Ying County—Nanliuhui Village and found that this "high-yield village" was actually like this:

    (1) The village has a total of sixty-three households. Labor model Gao Zheng and village cadres organized forty-eight households into thirteen "mutual aid groups," each group with five people. Most of the "mutual aid groups" never settled work points, and a few only exchanged labor between people and livestock. The best group (Gao Zheng's group) only settled thirty-eight work points this spring.

    (2) The labor model monopolizes everything, falsely reports achievements, and is divorced from the masses. Gao Zheng does not promote the production work of the whole village with his own exemplary actions under the leadership of the village cadres, but instead issues orders and stands above the village cadres, directing them. He made false reports to the government. The village dug one well, but he reported that they dug twenty-four. Last year, the government awarded him a waterwheel, and the masses wanted to organize with him to dig wells and use the waterwheel together, but he refused, preferring to keep the waterwheel at home rather than use it. The masses were already dissatisfied with such a "labor model." However, the leading cadres of Ying County did not understand these situations in depth and still believed that Gao Zheng was a banner among the masses.

    (3) The Party branch is not sound, and Party members cannot play a leading and guaranteeing role in production. The masses rarely receive political and ideological education, their understanding of the patriotic production increase movement is very vague, their conservative thinking is very serious, and they are afraid that increasing production will increase their burdens.

    (4) The village's high-yield plan was only formulated by a few cadres and Gao Zheng through consultation. They did not do detailed calculations at all, nor did they mobilize the masses to discuss it. They have no specific measures to increase yield per unit area. The production plan they formulated, adding the increased production to the original yield, still does not reach the normal actual yield (the average normal actual yield of this village is four large dou per mu, while the increase production plan is only three dou and eight sheng per mu).

    This "high-yield village" has neither a real leading backbone nor a mass base, but it made an "plan" that is divorced from reality. The leading cadres of Ying County did not go to the village to understand the specific situation, but only listened to a set of false reports exaggerating the achievements, and designated this village as a "high-yield village," and also wanted to use this village to "draw experience and promote comprehensive development." The county also decided that County Chief Zhang Chenghan would be responsible for leading this "high-yield village"; but Zhang Chenghan only went there once this spring, and did not find any problems, so naturally he did not play any leading role.

    This situation shows that in some areas, there are still extremely serious bureaucratic work styles and laissez-faire phenomena in the patriotic agricultural production increase movement. Nanliuhui Village in Ying County is an example that has been discovered, but it is by no means the only one.

    The experience of production movements over the years has proved that launching competitions and expanding movements from points to areas can often be done with just a few meetings, and can generally be carried out "vigorously"; but this does not mean that the movement has truly achieved results. To make the movement fruitful, it must be truly deepened. To do this, it depends on whether the leadership has the determination to do hard and in-depth work, whether the organization has reached the required level, whether the masses have been truly ideologically mobilized, whether the production increase plan is in line with reality, how many truly practical and effective production increase methods there are, and whether the Party's grassroots organizations can play a leading and guaranteeing role, and so on. These are the keys to truly deepening the patriotic production increase campaign. The leadership of Ying County did not solve any of these problems in Nanliuhui Village, so of course it could not produce good results. If other places do not solve these problems well or do not solve them in time, the production increase movement will also be in danger of failing. Therefore, the lessons of Nanliuhui Village should arouse the serious attention of leading cadres in various places.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, bureaucratic phenomena have generally decreased compared with the past. Many responsible comrades in various places have personally gone deep into the countryside to directly inspect and organize production increase competitions. This is one of the important reasons why this year's agricultural production increase competition can be widely carried out. However, it cannot be said that bureaucratic phenomena have been eliminated. On the contrary, there are still many bureaucratic work styles. The leading cadres in Ying County and other regions only listen to reports without asking about the truth, only make plans without making inspections, only know how to launch without managing in-depth work, only raise tasks without providing specific assistance; this bureaucratic work style is the main root of all formalistic tendencies and laissez-faire phenomena in production. It hinders the development of the agricultural production increase competition movement, and inevitably causes the movement to suffer serious losses. If bureaucracy is not eradicated, the patriotic production increase competition movement will be difficult to advance and will not have practical results. Therefore, in promoting the patriotic production increase competition movement, all localities should further combine the various tasks of summer production and mass appraisals to check the main links of the movement. It is necessary to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to conduct regular and timely top-down inspections and bottom-up supervision to eliminate all bureaucratic work styles of leading cadres at all levels, so as to ensure the victory of the patriotic production increase competition movement.

### 在农业爱国增产竞赛运动中肃清官僚主义作风

    在农业爱国增产竞赛运动中肃清官僚主义作风
    农业爱国增产竞赛运动开展得好的地区，一般地说都呈现了一片新气象。互助合作组织发展了，技术指导加强了，水利和肥料都增加了，耕作水平提高了，政治思想教育和生产运动密切地结合起来了。这是令人鼓舞的现象。但是，我们决不能满足于已有的成绩。有些地区在农业爱国增产竞赛运动中，发现了官僚主义、形式主义作风；对这种现象必须加以纠正和防止。
    中共察哈尔省雁北地委工作组曾到应县的一个“丰产村”——南柳会村作了一次检查，发现这个“丰产村”原来是这样一个村子：
    （一）全村共有六十三户人家。劳动模范高正和村干部把四十八户编制成十三个“互助组”，每组都是五个人。大部分“互助组”从来没有拨过工，少部分只是人畜换工。最好的一个组（高正的组），今春只拨了三十八个工。
    （二）劳动模范包办一切，假报成绩，脱离群众。高正不是在村干部的领导下，以自己的模范行动推动全村生产工作，而是发号施令，站在村干部之上，指挥村干部。他对政府作假报告。全村打了一眼井，他却报告说打了二十四眼。去年政府奖了他一辆水车，群众想和他组织起来打井，伙用水车，他不愿意，宁肯把水车放在家里也不使用。这样的“劳动模范”，群众早已对他不满了。但应县的领导干部，对这些情况却没有深入了解，还认为高正是群众中的旗帜。
    （三）党的支部不健全，党员在生产中不能起带头和保证作用。群众很少受到政治思想教育，对爱国增产运动的认识很模糊，保守思想很严重，怕提高了生产以后增加负担。
    （四）村的丰产计划，只是几个干部和高正商量着订出来的。他们根本没有算细帐，也没有发动群众讨论。他们对于提高单位面积产量没有什么具体办法。他们订的生产计划，原产量加上增产部分，还达不到常年实产量（这个村每亩平均常年实产量为四大斗，而增产计划每亩平均只三斗八升）。
    这个“丰产村”既没有真正的领导骨干，又没有群众基础，但是做了个脱离实际情况的“计划”。应县的领导干部没有去村里了解具体情况，只是听了一套夸大成绩的假报告，就把这个村确定为“丰产村”，还想拿这个村来“吸取经验，推动全面”。该县还确定由县长张成汉负责领导这个“丰产村”；可是张成汉今年春天只去过一次，也没有发现什么问题，自然也没有起什么领导作用。
    这一情况说明，若干地区在农业爱国增产运动中，还有极为严重的官僚主义作风和自流现象。应县南柳会村是已经被发现的一个例子，但决不是唯一的一个。
    历年来生产运动的经验证明，掀起竞赛和由点到面地展开运动，常常只要有几个会议就可以做到，而且一般地可以开展得“轰轰烈烈”；但这决不等于运动真正有了成绩。要使运动有丰富的收获，必须使运动真正深入下去。要想做到这样，就要看领导方面有没有做艰苦的深入的工作的决心，要看组织起来是不是达到了应有的程度，群众是不是真正从思想上发动起来了，增产计划是不是切合于实际，有多少真正切实有效的增产办法，以及党的基层组织是不是能起带头和保证作用，等等。这些就是爱国增产竞赛运动真正深入的关键。应县领导方面对于南柳会村的这些问题一个也没有解决，当然做不出好的结果。其他地方如果对这些问题解决得不好或解决得不及时，增产运动也同样会有落空的危险。因此，南柳会村的教训，应该引起各地领导干部的严重的注意。
    经过“三反”运动，官僚主义现象一般是比过去减少了。各地不少负责同志曾亲自深入农村，直接检查和组织增产竞赛运动。这是今年农业增产竞赛运动能够广阔开展的重要原因之一。但是，决不能说官僚主义现象已经被肃清了。恰恰相反，官僚主义作风还是不少的。应县和其他一些地区的领导干部，只听汇报而不问实情，只订计划而不作检查，只知发动而不管深入，只提任务而不加具体帮助；这种官僚主义作风，是生产上一切形式主义倾向和自流现象的主要根源。它阻碍着农业增产竞赛运动的开展，使运动必不可免地要遭受严重损失。官僚主义不铲除，爱国增产竞赛运动就很难前进，就不会有切实的成效。因此，各地在推进爱国增产竞赛运动中，应该进一步结合夏季生产的各项任务和群众性的评比，把运动的各个主要环节加以检查。要运用批评和自我批评的武器，经常地及时地进行自上而下的检查和自下而上的监督，肃清各级领导干部的一切官僚主义作风，以保证爱国增产竞赛运动的胜利。
