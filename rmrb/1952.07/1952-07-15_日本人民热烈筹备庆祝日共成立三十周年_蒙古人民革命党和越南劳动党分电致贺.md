Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japanese people will hold various forms of mass gatherings throughout Japan to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party (July 15th). Under the initiative and active preparation of prominent social leaders in Japan such as Ikuo Oyama, Tatsuji Fuse, Yoshitaro Hirano, and Umeichi Adachi, it has been decided to hold a grand "Japanese Communist Party 30th Anniversary Great Peace Festival" at Mitaka Green Park in Tokyo on July 13th. The commemorative meeting is scheduled to open at 1:00 PM, during which representatives from all walks of life will deliver congratulatory messages and speeches, and finally, the drama "The Nation's Steps" will be performed.
	In the Kyoto-Osaka area and other parts of Japan, various programs are also being prepared to celebrate the birthday of the Japanese Communist Party.
	Since the evening of the 11th, the Tokyo Japanese police authorities have begun "guarding" the Japanese people's celebration gatherings.
	Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 14th: The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on the 5th, congratulating the Japanese Communist Party on its 30th anniversary. The telegram reads as follows:
	The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party warmly congratulates the glorious Japanese Communist Party, the vanguard of the Japanese people, on its 30th anniversary.
	The Japanese Communist Party, tempered and tested in thirty years of heroic struggle, is victoriously carrying out active activities to defend the vital interests of the Japanese people, mobilizing and inspiring the Japanese people to engage in the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland, to defend peace, and to oppose the American aggressors and their running dogs—the Japanese reactionaries who are restoring aggressive Japanese militarism in an attempt to launch another world war.
	The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, representing the Mongolian people's feelings of close solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, warmly hopes that the Japanese Communist Party and all progressive forces of the Japanese people will achieve greater success in the struggle for peace, democracy, freedom, happiness, and the national independence of the Japanese people.
	Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 14th: Truong Chinh, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, congratulating the Japanese Communist Party on its 30th anniversary. The telegram reads as follows:
	On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, we, on behalf of all members of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese people, extend our warm congratulations to you and the Japanese people.
	Now, American imperialism and the Japanese puppet government have separately concluded a peace treaty, rearming Japan, and attempting to use Japan as a base for aggression against Asia and the destruction of world peace. Under your leadership, the Japanese people are resolutely opposing this war-provoking conspiracy of American imperialism.
	The Vietnamese people, who are fighting against the French colonialists and American interventionists, are excited to see the increasingly strong struggle of the Japanese people and deeply feel the unity and friendship between our two nations.
	In the cause of striving for national independence and defending peace in Asia and the world, the tasks of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people are arduous but also glorious. We celebrate your leadership in leading the Japanese working class and the Japanese people to achieve more great victories.
