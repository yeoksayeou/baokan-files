(Xinhua News Agency, July 7th) Under the powerful pressure of the West German people's movement against the "General Treaty," the U.S. State Department and its puppet, the Adenauer government, have encountered great difficulties in their plan to have the West German parliament quickly ratify the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Adenauer's flagrant signing of the "General Treaty" with the United States, Britain, and France, despite the opposition of the vast majority of the German people, has placed his own government in an even more isolated position. Within the West German ruling clique, not only has the right-wing leadership group of the Social Democratic Party been forced to publicly oppose the "General Treaty" under mass pressure, but also many important representatives within the ruling parties participating in the Adenauer government do not dare to rashly support Adenauer's demands. According to a report by the German News Agency, during a meeting between these ruling party representatives and Adenauer in June, these ruling party politicians suggested delaying the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty until a more favorable situation than the present one. This suggestion was later rejected by Adenauer. However, the West German "Nuremberg News" pointed out on June 20th that opposition to Adenauer's war policy was felt within the government's coalition parties. The general war treaty is so unpopular that even pro-government newspaper commentators still do not dare to support the treaty. Bonn's foreign policy has reached such an alarming degree of disregard for national interests that the general public considers supporting the government to be a great risk.

In this situation, despite the repeated orders from the U.S. government for Adenauer to expedite the ratification of the "General Treaty," Adenauer is facing great difficulties in carrying out the intentions of the United States. Adenauer originally planned to submit the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty only to the Federal Parliament (lower house), which is controlled by the ruling parties, for ratification, without submitting them to the Federal Council (upper house), which is controlled by the Social Democratic Party, in order to avoid delays. However, the prime ministers of the nine West German states unanimously decided on June 19th that these two treaties must be approved by the Federal Council. On the 20th, the Federal Council also resolved that these two treaties must be submitted to the Federal Council for approval, and that discussions on the ratification of the two treaties must wait until the Supreme Court has ruled on whether the current West German constitution allows German rearmament.

Commenting on this resolution of the Federal Council, the West German newspaper "Hamburger Echo" said: "The Chancellor (referring to Adenauer) must admit the first defeat suffered in the struggle to quickly ratify the Bonn and Paris treaties. The increasingly strong forces opposing the Chancellor's policy can no longer be stopped." The "Hamburger Freie Presse," which has close ties with the Bonn government, wrote: "Everyone knows that Adenauer himself has set July 20th, or at the latest the end of July, as the deadline for the ratification of the two treaties... This timetable has now been disrupted. The ruling parties, which are usually forced to follow Adenauer, have now refused to support Adenauer on a decisive issue for the first time. The Chancellor's defeat in the Federal Council may have a serious impact on the issue itself." A Reuters dispatch from Bonn on June 22nd revealed: "Officials in the West German government now realize that, although cabinet members are expressing optimism, it will take at least several more months to get the West German parliament to pass the general treaty signed by Chancellor Adenauer and the Western powers. The opinions expressed by influential West German politicians and newspapers since the signing of the treaty all indicate that there are still great difficulties in ratifying the general treaty." Obviously, the setbacks that Adenauer is currently encountering in quickly getting the West German parliament to ratify the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty are a direct blow to the U.S. plan to step up the armament of West Germany.

### 西德人民反对“一般性条约”  阿登纳傀儡政府更加众叛亲离

    西德人民反对“一般性条约”
    阿登纳傀儡政府更加众叛亲离
    【新华社七日讯】在西德人民反对“一般性条约”运动的强大压力下，美国国务院及其傀儡阿登纳政府想使西德议会迅速批准“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约的计划遇到了很大的困难。
    阿登纳不顾德国绝大多数人民的反对，悍然与美、英、法三国签订“一般性条约”的结果，使他自己的政府陷入了更加众叛亲离的境地。在西德统治集团内部，不仅社会民主党右翼领导集团在群众压力下已不得不公开表示反对“一般性条约”，连参加阿登纳政府的各执政党内部也有许多重要代表不敢贸然支持阿登纳的要求。据德意志通讯社报道，六月间，在这些执政党的代表们和阿登纳举行的会议上，这些执政党的政客都建议尽可能延缓到较目前更为有利的情况下才批准“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约。这个建议后来为阿登纳所拒绝。但是西德“纽伦堡新闻”在六月二十日指出，反对阿登纳战争政策的情绪在政府联合执政党中都感觉到了。一般性战争条约是如此不得人心，甚至一向亲政府的报纸评论家直到现在还不敢支持这个条约。波恩外交政策漠视民族利益已达到了如此惊人的程度，使得一般人认为支持政府是一个极大的冒险。
    在这种情况下，尽管美国政府一再命令阿登纳尽速使“一般性条约”获得批准，阿登纳要执行美国的意旨却有很大的困难。阿登纳原来计划只把“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约交各执政党控制着多数的联邦议会（下院）批准，而不提交社会民主党控制多数的联邦会议（上院）批准，以免拖延时日。但是，西德九个州的总理在六月十九日一致决定必须由联邦会议批准这两个条约。二十日，联邦会议又决议必须把这两个条约提交联邦会议批准，而且必须等到最高法院裁决了西德目前宪法是否允许德国重新武装问题以后才能讨论批准这两个条约。
    西德报纸“汉堡回声报”评论联邦会议的这个决议时说：“总理（按指阿登纳）必须承认在争取迅速批准波恩与巴黎条约的斗争中所遭到的第一个失败。反对总理政策的日益加强的力量，现在已阻挡不住了。”与波恩政府有密切联系的“汉堡自由报”写道：“大家都知道，阿登纳自己已经把七月二十日，至迟到七月底，定为批准两个条约的时限，……这个时间表现在已被打乱。各执政党通常是被迫追随阿登纳的，现在却第一次在一个决定性问题上拒绝支持阿登纳了。总理在联邦会议遭到的失败可能对问题本身发生严重的影响。”路透社波恩六月二十二日电透露：“西德政府的官员们现在认识到：虽然阁员们表示乐观，但是要想使西德议会通过阿登纳总理和西方国家所签订的一般性条约，至少还要好几个月。有势力的西德政治家们以及报纸，从这个条约签字后所表示的意见，都认为批准一般性条约还有很大困难。”显然，阿登纳迅速使西德议会批准“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约目前所遭到的挫败，也就是对美国加紧武装西德计划的直接打击。
