    The Supreme People's Court Simplified Many Document Procedures After the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    Editor: After the "Three-Anti" movement, the General Office and trial divisions of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government simplified many document procedures.
    Regarding case assignment, before the "Three-Anti," for example, civil cases had to be registered once by the clerk of the Civil Tribunal's General Office to the group leader's clerk of the relevant trial division, and then registered again by the clerk of the relevant judge. After the "Three-Anti," cases are only registered by the General Office (civil and criminal cases are handled by one General Office) to the clerk of the trial division (one per group). Regarding submission for verification and reporting of case closure, before the "Three-Anti," after a case was completed, the clerk of the judge handling the case gave it to the group leader's clerk for registration. When the group leader reviewed and signed it, the group leader's clerk sent it to the Tribunal's General Office for reporting and registration, and then the group leader's clerk returned it to the judge's clerk. Cases submitted for verification were sent by the group leader's clerk to the General Office, then by the General Office to the presiding judge or president for registration. After the presiding judge or president verified it, it was registered by the General Office and returned to the group leader's clerk, then returned to the judge's clerk. After the "Three-Anti," submission for verification and reporting of case closure are handled directly by the trial division's clerk to the presiding judge, president, or to the General Office. In addition, the case closure register was abolished in the case closure procedures, and registration was changed to the case assignment register, and the judgment number was changed to the case assignment number. In this way, five-fourths fewer characters can be written than before the "Three-Anti," and two-thirds of the time can be saved. Previously, three people did the case closure registration work, but now only one person is needed. Even during the busiest times, only one additional person is needed to help. Regarding criminal and certain civil cases that require the plaintiffs' complaints to be transferred to lower-level courts or relevant agencies for assistance in handling, only pre-printed triplicate forms are filled out, eliminating procedures such as ordering files, drafting, submitting for verification, verifying drafts, handing over to copyists, and filing, which greatly saves manpower, materials, and time.

### 最高人民法院在“三反”后简化了许多文牍手续

    最高人民法院在“三反”后简化了许多文牍手续
    编辑同志：“三反”运动以后，中央人民政府最高人民法院书记室和审判组之间简化了许多文牍手续。
    关于分案，“三反”以前，如民事案件须由民事审判庭书记室分给有关审判组组长的书记员登记一次，再分给有关审判员的书记员登记一次。“三反”以后，案件只由书记室（民事、刑事统由一个书记室）分到审判组的书记员（一组一个）登记即可。关于送核、报结，“三反”以前，案件办结后，由承办该案的审判员的书记员交给审判组长的书记员登记一次，经审判组长审核签发时，由组长的书记员送审判庭书记室报结登记，再由组长书记员交还审判员的书记员。送核的案件，是由组长的书记员送交书记室，再由书记室送交庭长或院长处登记一次，庭长或院长核定后，经书记室登记，退交组长的书记员，再退交审判员的书记员。“三反”以后，送核、报结都由审判组的书记员直接向庭长、院长或向书记室办理了。另外，在结案手续上取消了结案簿，改在分案簿上登记，裁判号改用分案号。这样，较“三反”以前，可少写五分之四的字，可节省三分之二的时间。以前三个人作结案登记工作，现在只要一个人便可以了。即使在工作最多的时候，也只须要加一个人帮助一下便可以了。关于需要把当事人的诉状转送下级法院或有关机关协助处理的刑事和某些民事案件，一律只填写印好的三联例稿即可，省去了订卷、办稿、送核、核稿、交缮、归档等手续，这就大大地节省了人力、物力、时间。
