The bureaucratic errors in leadership exposed in the Wen County Court's violations of law and discipline case are serious and multifaceted. The relevant authorities and cadres are now conducting in-depth investigations. Based on the existing materials, the bureaucratic errors of the Wen County Court's leadership are mainly manifested in the following four aspects:

First, there was insufficient understanding of the importance of the People's Court as a powerful tool of the people's democratic dictatorship, and a lack of vigilance against the influence of the Kuomintang reactionary rule's remaining practices and the bourgeoisie's fierce corruption of the revolutionary ranks and the People's Court. Originally, after the victory of the people's revolution, it was even more necessary to strengthen the state apparatus of the people's democratic dictatorship and severely suppress counter-revolutionaries to safeguard the people's interests and consolidate the already achieved fruits of the revolution. However, many comrades who bear certain leadership responsibilities lacked the necessary awareness of this. Their thinking lagged behind the development of the revolutionary situation, and bad elements took advantage of this gap. The vigorous and large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1950 and 1951 achieved great successes in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and mobilizing the masses. However, we did not truly recognize the importance of the organs that are regularly responsible for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In addition, due to a lack of vigilance against the influence of the Kuomintang reactionary rule's remaining practices and the corruption of bourgeois ideology, many problems were not understood from a class perspective, and their seriousness was not understood. This is clearly manifested in the fact that the selection and allocation of cadres for the People's Court often lacked seriousness, resulting in a lack of backbone elements with firm class standpoints and clear mass viewpoints in the People's Court. In addition, there was a lack of specific and in-depth inspections of the work of the People's Court. This allowed scum like Wang Gaosheng to seize leadership positions and boldly carry out criminal activities against the Party and the people.

Second, there was a lack of historical and essential understanding of Wang Gaosheng and Yang Zhiwen, which led to their being admitted into the Party organization. This is a major shortcoming and error in Party building and cadre work. The leadership's view of them was tinged with a certain degree of sectarian sentiment and formalistic viewpoints. For example, Wang Gaosheng was considered an "old Party member" and "old cadre." The general cadre's impression of Wang Gaosheng in the past was that he "dressed poorly and spoke steadily." The Wen County Party Committee also believed that he lacked principle or had low political enthusiasm, but they all considered him "simple and unadorned." Therefore, they were not seriously and strictly educated and reformed, and their work and life lacked strict inspection. In the autumn of 1949, someone who had been raped accused Wang Gaosheng. In 1951, when the struggle against those who did not care about political tendencies was launched, the Wen County Party Committee discovered that Wang Gaosheng's life was degenerate and corrupt and named him at a meeting. During the same period, it was discovered that Wang and Yang were lending money at usurious rates. However, because these problems were neither raised to a principled level nor analyzed in connection with their history and essence, and because they were deceived by their hypocrisy, they could not resolutely pursue the matter to the end and further discover the problems. Instead, they adopted a wavering and hesitant attitude, allowing them to resist and deny the charges, and the matter was left unresolved. This allowed a small number of bad elements such as Wang Gaosheng and Yang Zhiwen to hide within the revolutionary ranks for a long time and carry out criminal activities.

Third, political and ideological leadership was weak, and there was a lack of normal democratic life systems within the Party and within the organs. Ideological struggle, criticism, and self-criticism were not truly carried out. This allowed a small number of bad elements to dare to do whatever they wanted without being exposed or, if something was discovered, without being thoroughly resolved. The "Three-Anti" movement has given us a profound education. Once democracy within the Party and within the organs is promoted, and once criticism and self-criticism are carried out, all dirty things will be exposed and eliminated, and the revolutionary organization will be further consolidated and strengthened.

Finally, there was a failure to truly understand that our country belongs to the people, and that Party and state workers must be placed under the supervision of the masses. Therefore, there was a lack of serious mobilization and education of the masses in our work, and we did not seriously take various measures to strengthen our ties with the masses and listen to their opinions and voices. The fact that no feedback from the masses was heard prior to the Wen County Court case, which was so huge and involved the interests of so many people, fully exposes the weaknesses in our thinking and work style. We also did not pay enough attention to the People's Congress or the People's Representative Conference, which are the fundamental forms of our state power, nor were we good at using the Congress or the Representative Conference to raise the people's awareness as masters of the country and to give play to the masses' supervisory role over state workers. To this day, we have rarely conducted systematic education on people's democracy and people's rights among the people in connection with specific work. For our work, we lack both top-down inspections and, especially, mass-led bottom-up inspections. Therefore, many problems cannot be discovered. Ideological struggle, criticism, and self-criticism are also weak and ineffective due to a lack of mass foundation. In addition, we do not pay enough attention to the masses' accusations and reports. This allows a small number of bad elements such as Wang Gaosheng and Yang Zhiwen to recklessly oppress the masses and deceive the leading organs.

The above are the main aspects of the bureaucratic errors we committed in the Wen County Court's violations of law and discipline case, and these are our painful lessons. Our inspection is still not deep enough, and the overcoming of bureaucratic errors will require long-term conscious efforts. We are determined to take the Wen County Court case as a typical example, in conjunction with the Zhang Shunyou incident and other typical incidents in our region, to conduct a more in-depth criticism and inspection movement against bureaucracy in a led and organized manner. We will conscientiously strengthen democratic life and systems within the Party, within the organs, and among the masses, periodically convene Party congresses or representative conferences and representative conferences of organ cadres and people's congresses or representative conferences of all sectors, inspect work, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, improve the system for handling mass accusations and reports, and strive to strengthen our ties with the masses in all aspects.

    温县法院违法乱纪案件的沉痛教训
    中共平原省新乡地委书记  张俊卿
    温县法院违法乱纪案件中所暴露的领导方面的官僚主义错误，是严重的、多方面的。现在各有关机关和干部正进行深入的检查。就已有的材料来看，温县法院领导方面的官僚主义错误，主要地表现在下列四个方面：
    首先，对人民民主专政的强有力的工具之一——人民法院的重要性认识不足，同时又对国民党反动统治的残余作风的影响和资产阶级思想对革命队伍和人民法院的猛烈腐蚀，缺乏警惕。本来，在人民革命胜利后，更需要强化人民民主专政的国家机器，严厉镇压反革命，以保卫人民利益和巩固已取得的革命胜利成果；但是，许多担负一定领导责任的同志对此却缺乏应有的自觉性，他们的思想落后于革命形势的发展，坏分子就恰好钻了这个空隙。一九五○年及一九五一年轰轰烈烈大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，虽在镇压反革命、发动群众方面取得了巨大的成绩；但我们没有真正认识经常负责镇压反革命的机关的重要性。再加上对国民党反动统治残余作风的影响和资产阶级思想的腐蚀缺乏警惕，因而对很多问题没有从阶级本质上来认识，不了解其严重性。这显明地表现在对人民法院的干部常常缺乏认真的选拔和调配，致使人民法院中缺乏阶级立场坚定、群众观点明确的骨干分子；另外，对人民法院的工作，也缺乏具体的深入的检查。这样就使像王高升一流的败类，能够窃据领导岗位，放胆地进行反党反人民的罪恶活动。
    其次，对王高升、杨治文缺乏历史的本质的了解，以致让他们混入了党的组织。这是建党和干部工作上的重大缺点和错误。领导方面对他们的看法，则带有一定程度的宗派情绪和形式主义观点。如认为王高升是“老党员”、“老干部”。一般干部过去对王高升的反映是，“穿的破，说话稳”；温县县委也只是认为他原则性不够或政治情绪不高，但又都认为他是“朴素的”。因而对他们没有认真地严肃地进行教育改造，对他们的工作和生活，缺乏严格的检查。一九四九年秋曾有被强奸者控告王高升；一九五一年开展反对不问政治倾向斗争时，温县县委曾发现王高升生活堕落腐化，并在大会上点了他的名；同时期又发现王、杨放高利贷。但由于对这些问题既未提高到原则上来认识，又未与他们的历史和本质联系起来分析，再加上被他们的伪善所迷惑，所以就不能坚决追根到底，进一步发现问题；而采取了动摇犹豫，任其狡赖抵抗，不了了之的态度。这就使王高升、杨治文等少数坏分子有可能长期隐藏在革命队伍内部进行罪恶的活动。
    再次，是政治思想领导薄弱，党内和机关内部缺乏正常的民主生活制度，思想斗争、批评和自我批评没有真正展开。这就使少数坏分子敢于为所欲为，而不能被揭露，或有所发觉而不能得到彻底的解决。这次“三反”运动给了我们以深刻的教育，只要党内、机关内的民主一旦发扬起来，批评和自我批评一旦开展起来，一切污浊的东西便将被揭发出来，清除出去，革命组织便会进一步巩固和健全起来。
    最后，没有真正理解我们的国家是属于人民的，党的和国家的工作人员必须放在群众监督之下；因而在工作中缺乏对群众的认真发动和教育，没有认真地采取各种办法加强和群众的联系，倾听群众的意见和呼声。像温县法院如此巨大的牵连到许多群众的利益的案件，事前竟没有听见群众的反映，这便充分暴露了我们在思想和作风上的弱点。对于作为我们国家政权的根本形式的人民代表大会或人民代表会议的认识以及运用，我们也重视不够，不善于经过代表大会或代表会议来提高人民的主人翁自觉，发挥群众对国家工作人员的监督作用。我们至今还很少在人民群众中结合具体工作进行较系统的人民民主和人民权利的教育。对于工作，既缺乏自上而下的检查，尤其缺乏发动群众自下而上的检查。因而很多问题不能发现。思想斗争、批评和自我批评，也由于缺乏群众基础，表现得软弱无力。此外，我们对于群众的检举、控告也不重视。这就使王高升、杨治文少数坏分子得以放肆地欺压群众和欺骗领导机关。
    以上是我们在温县法院违法乱纪案中所犯官僚主义错误的几个主要方面，也就是我们的沉痛教训。我们的检查仍是不深刻的，而官僚主义错误的克服则还需要长期的自觉的努力。我们决心以温县法院案件为典型，结合张顺有事件及本区其他典型事件，有领导有组织地开展一个对官僚主义更为深入的批判检查运动。认真地加强党内、机关内和群众中的民主生活和制度，定期地召开党员代表大会或代表会议和机关干部的代表会议以及各界人民代表大会或代表会议，检查工作，发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，改进处理群众检举和控告的制度，力求从各方面加强和群众的联系。
