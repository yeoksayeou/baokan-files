Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: Hirohito, the Japanese Emperor and tool of American rule in Japan, is not only a big landlord, but also a big capitalist with enormous other wealth.

Like Japan's famous Zaibatsu Mitsui and Mitsubishi, Hirohito also possesses a large amount of capital. According to a 1945 survey, Hirohito owned more than 1.52 million shares in various enterprises. He also owns huge amounts of other securities and gems. Calculated at the 1945 market price, the gems alone were worth 1.5 billion yen; estimated at current prices, they would be worth more than 100 billion yen.

At the same time, Hirohito is also a big robber who often plunders large amounts of tax money collected from the Japanese people. Last year, the Japanese budget expenditure for "Imperial Household expenses" reached 144 million yen, which means that Hirohito's income in this area alone is about 400,000 yen per day. And Hirohito does not pay a single tax on all his income.

    裕仁是大地主又是大资本家
    【新华社讯】东京消息：美国统治日本的工具日皇裕仁，不仅是一个大地主，而且是一个拥有巨额其他财富的大资本家。
    与日本的著名财阀三井、三菱等一样，裕仁也拥有着大量的资本，据一九四五年的调查，裕仁在各企业中所占有的股份，共有一百五十二万股以上。他还拥有巨额的其他有价证券和宝石。按一九四五年的时价计算，仅宝石一项就值十五亿日元；如按现价计算，估计将达一千亿日元以上。
    同时，裕仁还是一个经常大量掠夺征自日本人民的税款的大强盗。去年度日本预算支出的“皇室费”达一亿四千四百万日元，这就是说，裕仁仅在这方面的收入每天就约有四十万日元。而裕仁的全部收入，连一文税也不缴纳。
