Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: The British government's despicable behavior of wantonly attacking and framing Archbishop Johnson, a religious figure advocating for peace, has aroused infinite anger among Chinese Catholics. Li Junwu, Deputy Bishop of the Chinese Catholic Beijing Diocese, and Jia Zhenmin, Chairman of the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee, issued a declaration on behalf of all Catholics in Beijing, lodging a serious protest against the British government's unreasonable persecution of Archbishop Johnson. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

    After visiting China, Archbishop Johnson of Canterbury, England, held a press conference in London where he listed many facts about germ warfare and provided a great deal of strong evidence exposing the crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare in Korea and China. This event has aroused widespread attention among the broad masses of the British people, and has also been subjected to unreasonable slander and persecution by the British ruling group, with some even proposing to try Johnson for treason.

    We Chinese Catholics express our infinite respect for Johnson's righteous words and his fighting spirit in defending peace, and give him resolute and strong support!

    The British ruling group's barbaric persecution of peace fighter Johnson is obviously futile and cannot cover up the facts. As Johnson said to British reporters: "I believe that our British Church will soon believe in the facts of germ warfare and will demand a ban on this weapon of mass slaughter."

    We sent a letter to Johnson asking him to convey the Chinese Catholics' protest against American germ warfare to Catholics in Britain, the United States, and the world, hoping that they will unite with us to stop the American aggressors' germ warfare and defend human peace. In the future, we will more resolutely support Johnson's just actions together with peace-loving people all over the world. The British ruling group's crazy behavior can only end in a final shameful defeat!

    中国天主教北京教区副主教李君武等发表宣言
    抗议英政府无理迫害约翰逊的卑鄙行为
    【新华社十八日讯】英国政府对宗教界和平人士约翰逊教长肆行非法攻击和陷害的卑鄙行为，已引起中国天主教徒的无限愤怒。中国天主教北京教区副主教李君武、北京市天主教革新委员会主席贾振民特代表北京市全体天主教徒发表宣言，对英国政府无理迫害约翰逊教长的卑鄙手段提出严重抗议。宣言全文如下：
    英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊在我国参观访问之后回到伦敦在招待记者会上发表谈话，列举了许多细菌战的事实，提供了很多有力证据揭露了美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的罪行。这一事件引起了英国广大人民的普遍重视，同时也遭致英国统治集团无理的诽谤和迫害，甚至有人提议以叛国罪来审讯约翰逊。
    我们中国天主教徒对约翰逊的仗义执言、保卫和平的战斗精神表示无限的敬意，并予以坚决有力的支持！
    英国统治集团对和平战士约翰逊的野蛮迫害举动显然是徒劳的，是掩不住事实的，诚如约翰逊向英国记者所说：“我相信我们英国教会不久也会相信细菌战的事实，并且将要求禁止这种大规模屠杀的武器。”
    我们送致约翰逊信函要求他把中国天主教徒对于美国细菌战的抗议告诉英国、美国和全世界的天主教徒，希望他们和我们团结起来制止美国侵略者的细菌战，保卫人类的和平。今后我们更要和全世界爱好和平的人民坚决支持约翰逊的这种正义行动，英国统治集团的疯狂行为只能遭到最后可耻的失败！
