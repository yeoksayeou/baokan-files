    The Cultural Life of Workers at the State-Run Huaibei Salt Field
    Shen Min
    On the edge of the Yellow Sea in the eastern part of our motherland lies the nationally renowned State-Run Huaibei Salt Field. Under the wise leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, the cultural life of the salt workers has been improving day by day, along with their economic lives. A folk song is circulating in the salt field: "In the past, if I picked up a newspaper, people would laugh. An illiterate salt worker, how could he understand anything? A horizontal line, a vertical line, who knows if it's right or upside down. Now when I pick up the "Dazhong Bao" (The Masses' Paper), nobody laughs. I can understand quite a few revolutionary principles..." This fully demonstrates that the cultural level of the salt workers has greatly improved. In the past, salt workers had no schools. Now, the entire field has 39 vocational and after-work schools, with most workers participating in learning. There are 38 schools for workers' children, where over three thousand children happily study.

    The liberated salt workers have almost all plunged into a wave of learning. They say: "Learning is like eating; if you don't learn for a day, you feel uncomfortable." For example, at the Yanwei Workers' School, as soon as the gongs and drums are sounded, the workers rush to the classroom, some even skipping meals to attend school. Once, a female worker named Wang Lanying went to school in the rain, and her clothes were soaked. The salt workers' enthusiasm for learning is very high; tables, doors, and walls in every household are covered with writing. Sun Shoujin, a learning model, writes the difficult words on the door with chalk, reading them twice every time he goes in and out; he puts the book on the pot lid while grinding, reciting the lesson while working. People call him a "bookworm," but he laughs and says: "You must know that today workers are masters, so they must study hard to build the country." Yang Yicai, a sixty-year-old salt worker, also participates in learning. Xu Shiying said: "He has never been to school before, and now at sixty years old, he is still a primary school student. This is all the happiness that Chairman Mao has given us!" Zhang Lanying, a young female worker, and her newlywed husband, Sun Chenggao, study until late at night every day. There are many such typical examples.

    Through three years of such intensive study, the workers have achieved great results. Workers generally recognize a thousand or so characters. In the past year, more than four hundred people could write notes, and some could read the "Dazhong Bao"; some could write articles, and more than five hundred learning models emerged, and more than four hundred and forty people became volunteer teachers. Xu Shiying, a 23-year-old female worker, has been selected as a learning model three times and a production model four times in the past three years. Last autumn, when a teacher took leave, she took on the teaching work of the entire *wei* (production unit team), and now she is a volunteer teacher. She not only studies actively herself but also helps and encourages others to learn. Yang Rulan, a young woman who had never left her home, also joined the study group under her encouragement. Because there was no classroom in Xuanwu *wei*, she offered her own house.

    New developments are constantly emerging in the cultural life of the Huaibei Salt Field workers. The workers have their own newspaper - the "Salt Field Dazhong Bao"; more than 360 salt workers have learned to write articles, and more than 50 have become model worker correspondents for the newspaper. Chen Xuezhang, a young salt worker, wrote eighteen articles in May alone. Liu Guohua, a worker, can now write short literary reports. Workers not only subscribe to various newspapers as study materials, but also organize more than 300 newspaper reading groups for regular study. Each *wei* also has a blackboard newspaper to exchange production and learning experiences promptly. The salt workers happily sing:

    "The little blackboard newspaper is really great, it has news and ditties. It says what's bad is bad, and what's good is good, promoting production and learning, it's really unbelievably good." Each club has a small library with about four thousand copies of various comic books and literary books.

    The salt workers are rich in artistic talent and creativity. They use folk songs, *kuaiban* (clapper talk), *gushu* (drum ballad) and other artistic forms to express production achievements, experiences and various activities. Because of their rich production experience and vivid and popular language, these works are quickly spread through blackboard newspapers and the "Salt Field Dazhong Bao." The literary works of salt field workers also frequently appear in "Northern Jiangsu Literature", "Salt Field Dazhong Bao" and Northern Jiangsu Daily.

    The workers have established their own amateur worker theater troupe, with more than 700 workers acting as performers. In 1946, the local Communist Party organization and the People's Government organized the salt worker theater troupe. At that time, the material conditions were very difficult. They used copper basin lamps instead of lights, soot and face powder replaced greasepaint, and bedding and windmill awnings replaced curtains. Today, they have acquired new-style curtains and new props. They have performed "Three Generations of Hatred", "The White-Haired Girl" and "Dayuling", and also performed plays such as "Oppose American Imperialism Arming Japan" "Resist America, Aid Korea" and "American Young Master Soldiers". They have also written and performed their own plays such as "Mutual Aid Group" and "Work Hard", which have played a certain role in enlightening the salt workers' class consciousness and inspiring their production enthusiasm.

    The workers have also organized singing teams, men's and women's basketball teams, and waist drum teams. The Kaitai *suo* (section) women's basketball team won the glorious title of "Basketball Champion" in Taipei field. These are all things that the salt field did not have in the past. This year, the Fangyang field male and female salt workers also organized a dance class, and now 290 people are participating in dance learning. As soon as the workers take a break, they dance youth dances and border dances in the square. Even Chen Xiuying, who already has three children, participates in the dance.

    The cultural life of the Huaibei Salt Field workers is closely integrated with various central tasks. In the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law, all vocational and after-work schools conducted studies. Fifty-four female workers at the Houzui Workers' School held discussions and expressed their painful lives under the old marriage system. Everyone agreed: "The People's Government is so good, the promulgation of the Marriage Law has saved so many young men and women!" At the Lubei *suo* vocational and after-work school, when studying the Marriage Law, those who had beaten their wives made self-criticisms. Zhang Fengying, a child bride in Donggang *suo*, bravely fought against the unreasonable old marriage under the education of the Marriage Law and finally found a beloved partner. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the young worker Chen Xuezhang personally arrested his counter-revolutionary brother. In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, after the salt workers received patriotic education, they created the highest output record in sixteen years last year and overfulfilled the donation plan for a "Huaibei Salt Field Aircraft". In the great "Three-Anti" movement, the workers reported corrupt elements, fully demonstrating their attitude as masters of the country. They made self-criticisms of their own phenomena such as wasting raw materials and not cherishing tools, and formulated plans to increase production and save resources. In order to complete this year's task of increasing production and saving 25 billion yuan, more than 90% of the salt fields have implemented collective production.

    In order to more widely carry out the literacy movement, eliminate illiteracy among employees, and further improve the cultural level of salt workers, it is planned to universally promote Qi Jianhua's "Rapid Literacy Method" after September this year. At present, a large number of employee teachers are being trained.

    国营淮北盐场工人的文化生活
    沈敏
    在我们祖国东部黄海边上，有一个全国闻名的国营淮北盐场。在人民政府和共产党的英明领导下，盐工们的文化生活，随着经济生活的改善，也一天一天提高了。盐场里流传着这样一首民谣：“从前我要拿张报，人家看见一定笑。不识字的卤腿子，还能看出什么窍。横一道，竖一道，谁知是正还是倒。现在拿起大众报，谁个看了也不会笑。革命的大道理，我也能够懂几套。……”这充分说明了盐工的文化水平大大提高了。从前盐工没有学校，现在全场已有三十九所职工业余学校，大多数职工参加了学习；职工子弟学校有三十八所，三千多名儿童愉快地在这里读着书。
    翻了身的盐工们，几乎全部卷入了学习的热潮。他们说：“学习好比吃饭，一天不学习，心里就难过。”例如燕尾职工学校，只要把锣鼓一敲，工人们都争先恐后地往课堂里跑，有的工人有时连饭都不吃，便去上学。女工王兰英有一次冒着雨上学，衣服都湿透了。盐工们的学习情绪是非常高的，家家的桌上、门上、墙上，都写满了字。学习模范孙守金，用粉笔把难记的字写在门上，出门进门都读它两遍；推磨时把书放在锅盖上，一面推一面背着课文。人家称他“书迷”，他却笑着说：“你们要知道，今天工人做了主人，就得努力学习，建设祖国。”六十岁的老盐工杨仪才也参加了学习。徐士英说：“他从来没有上过学，今年已经六十岁了，还做一个小学生，这都是毛主席给我们的幸福啊！”青年女工张兰英和她的新婚丈夫孙成高，每天晚上总要学习到深夜。像这样的典型事例是很多的。
    三年来工人们经过这样紧张的学习，取得了很大成绩。工人一般地已识到千把个字。在前年就有四百多人会写便条，有的已能看看大众报；有的已会写稿，涌现了五百多名学习模范，并有四百四十多人做了义务教师。二十三岁的女工徐士英，近三年来，已三次当选为学习模范，四次当选为生产模范。去年秋天教师请假时，她就负起了全圩（生产单位小组）的教学工作，现在并做了义务教师。她不但自己积极学习，还帮助和推动别人学习。从来没有出过家门的大姑娘杨汝兰，也在她动员下参加学习了。宣五圩因为没有教室，她就把家里的房子让出来。
    淮北盐场工人的文化生活上不断出现了新的气象。工人们有了自己的报纸——“盐场大众报”；有三百六十多个盐工学会了写稿，其中五十多名成为报纸的模范工人通讯员。青年盐工陈学章，在今年红五月中就写了十八篇稿子。工人刘国华已经能写出短小的文艺通讯了。工人们不单订了各种不同的报纸，作为平时的学习材料，而且还组织了三百多个读报组，经常进行读报学习。各圩还有黑板报，及时地交流生产与学习经验。盐工们高兴地唱道：
    “小小黑板报，真是刮刮叫，有新闻，有小调。有坏说坏，有好就说好，推动生产与学习，真是好得不得了。”在每个俱乐部里，都设立了小型图书馆，约有四千册各种连环图画和文艺书籍。
    盐工们是富有艺术天才和创造性的，他们运用小调、快板、鼓词等文艺形式，把生产成绩、经验及各种活动表现出来。由于他们生产经验的丰富，语言的通俗生动，这些作品很快就通过黑板报和“盐场大众”普遍地传开了。在“苏北文艺”、“盐场大众”和苏北日报上，也经常出现盐场工人的文艺作品。
    工人自己成立了工人业余剧团，有七百多工人做了演员。在一九四六年，当地共产党组织和人民政府就组织了盐工剧团，那时的物质条件很困难，他们用铜盆灯代替灯火，用锅底灰、铅粉、洋红代替了油彩，用被里子、风车篷等代替了幕布。今天，他们已置备了新式布幕和新式道具了。他们演出过“三世仇”、“白毛女”、“大榆林”，也演过“反对美帝国主义武装日本”、“抗美援朝”、“美国少爷兵”等剧。他们也自编自演过“互助组”、“加油干”等剧本，对启发盐工的阶级觉悟，鼓舞盐工的生产热情，起了一定的作用。
    工人们还组织了歌咏队、男女球队、腰鼓队等。开泰所女工篮球队，曾得到台北场“篮球冠军”的光荣称号。这些都是过去盐场没有过的事情。今年方洋场男女盐工还组织了舞蹈学习班，现在已有二百九十人参加舞蹈学习。工人们一休息，就在广场上跳起青年舞、边疆舞，连已有三个小孩的陈秀英也参加了跳舞。
    淮北盐场工人的文化生活，是和各种中心工作密切结合着的。在贯彻执行婚姻法的宣传中，各职工业余学校都进行了学习。猴咀职工学校五十四个女工进行了讨论，纷纷倾诉了旧式婚姻制度下的痛苦生活，大家一致说：“人民政府真好，公布了婚姻法，不知救了多少青年男女啊！”路北所职工业余学校，在学习婚姻法时，打骂过老婆的人，都作了检讨。东港所童养媳张凤英，在婚姻法的教育下，勇敢地和不合理的旧婚姻作了斗争，终于找到了心爱的对象。在镇压反革命运动中，青年工人陈学章亲自逮捕了反革命的哥哥。在抗美援朝运动中，盐工们经过爱国主义的教育，去年创造了十六年来产量最高纪录，超额完成了“淮北盐场号飞机”一架的捐献计划。在伟大的“三反”运动中，工人纷纷检举贪污分子，充分地表现了国家主人翁的态度。他们对自己的浪费原料、不爱护工具等现象，都作了自我检讨，订出了增产节约计划。为了完成今年计划增产节约二百五十亿元的任务，全场已有百分之九十以上的滩地，实行了集体生产。
    为了更广泛地开展识字运动，扫除职工中的文盲，并进一步提高盐工的文化水平，准备在今年九月以后普遍推行祁建华“速成识字法”。现在，大批职工教师正在进行训练中。
