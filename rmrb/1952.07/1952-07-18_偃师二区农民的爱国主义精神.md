    The Patriotic Spirit of Farmers in the Second District of Yanshi
    Editor: At 8:00 PM on June 15th, the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's No. 713 cargo train was traveling between Yanshi and Baimasi stations on the Longhai Railway when the tenth car, loaded with matches, spontaneously combusted due to the intense heat. The conductor noticed the fire and immediately stopped the train; the driver also sounded the whistle for help. Upon hearing the whistle, cadres from the farmers' associations and the masses of farmers from Bai Village, Shiqiao, Xinyang and other villages in the second district of Yanshi rushed to the rescue. Shang Ping'an, chairman of the Shiqiao Township Farmers' Association, Wang Wan'an, a demobilized soldier, and Zhang Zhensuc, a farmer, braved the flames and climbed onto the roof of the car to direct the farmers to open the car doors, pouring water and rescuing the matches. Wang Qing, chairman of the Bai Village Township Farmers' Association, mutual aid team leader Yi Lou, Zhang Yaba, female labor model Bai Xingwang, Zhang Ronghua, Ba Wanyong, the militia captain of Xinyang Township, and others all soaked their clothes and braved the smoke and fire to rescue the matches. Wang Jianzhong, the principal of Shiqiao Township Elementary School, and Ji Shuiping, the principal of Bai Village Township Elementary School, also led teachers and students from their schools to help put out the fire. Thanks to the courageous rescue efforts of more than 1,700 farmers in the second district of Yanshi, the fire was completely extinguished in one hour and eight minutes, rescuing 907 baskets of intact matches, preventing damage to the vehicles, and reducing the country's losses by more than 200 million yuan. This fact fully demonstrates the patriotic spirit of the farmer masses in cherishing national property and the people's railway.

    偃师二区农民的爱国主义精神
    编辑同志：六月十五日下午八时，郑州铁路管理局的七一三次货物列车行驶在陇海线偃师和白马寺两站之间时，第十辆火柴车因气候酷热，自燃起来。车长发觉后，马上停车；司机亦鸣笛请求救援。偃师二区的白村、石桥、信阳等乡的农会干部和农民群众听到笛声，纷纷赶来抢救。石桥乡农会主席尚平安、转业军人王万安和农民张振宿，不顾危险，冒着火焰，抢登车顶，指挥农民群众开启车门，一面泼水，一面抢救火柴。白村乡农会主席王清，互助组长依楼、张哑吧，女劳动模范白兴旺、张容华，信阳乡武装队长巴万勇等都浇湿了衣服，冒着烟火抢救火柴。石桥乡小学校长王建中，白村乡小学校长季水平也率领学校教员和学生赶来救火。由于偃师二区农民一千七百多人奋勇抢救，在一小时零八分的时间内，就把火全部扑灭，抢出了完好的火柴九百零七篓，防止了车辆的烧损，给国家减少了两亿多元的损失。这个事实，充分表现了农民群众爱护国家物资和人民铁路的爱国主义精神。
