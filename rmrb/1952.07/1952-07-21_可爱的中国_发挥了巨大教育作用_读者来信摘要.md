    “Lovely China” Plays a Huge Educational Role
     ——Reader Letters Excerpts
    Since the publication of the martyr Fang Zhimin's posthumous work "Lovely China," it has been deeply loved by the majority of readers. Our newspaper has successively received contributions and letters from comrades Shi Bingtang, Feng Lei, Feng Yuanxun, Huang Renxiao, Yu Zuomin, etc., praising this book for its great educational significance to readers.
    Shi Bingtang of the Beijing Institute of Technology said: "This is not an ordinary book, it is a book written by Comrade Fang Zhimin when he was imprisoned by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Comrade Fang Zhimin did not write about his personal affairs in prison, but about how imperialism invaded and insulted our great and lovely motherland - the motherland. He called on everyone to overthrow imperialism, eliminate the reactionaries, and build our great motherland. This fully demonstrates the noble qualities of a Communist Party member and his infinite confidence in the bright future of the motherland."
    Feng Yuanxun of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers said: "Comrade Zhimin, in a prison where he could be executed at any time, not only did not consider his personal life or death, but said: 'If it can liberate the Chinese nation, then what do I care about this ant-like life of mine!' This is such a great and noble spirit of self-sacrifice, worthy of our study."
    Huang Renxiao of No. 55 Chongqing Road, Tianjin, said: "After reading this book, I feel that the happy era we are in today was bought with the blood and sacrifice of countless martyrs. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our country has 'can stand before mankind without shame,' but this is only the beginning, and we need to inherit the legacy of the martyrs and continue to work hard."
    Yu Zuomin of the Finance Section of the Ordnance Department of the North China Military Region said: "Every word in the book is like a bomb, constantly exploding and blossoming before my eyes. The more I read, the more my blood boils, and the more violently it vibrates. How can anyone with blood not be filled with righteous indignation at the devastation of our motherland by imperialism? This text, which radiates intense flames of anger, powerfully warns the invaders: The Chinese people are not to be insulted, the Chinese nation is not to be insulted, and the imperialist bandits will definitely be finished! This article also powerfully reminds people: Fight bravely, and China can consolidate its victory."

    “可爱的中国”发挥了巨大教育作用
     ——读者来信摘要
    共产党员方志敏烈士的遗著“可爱的中国”出版以后，受到了广大读者的热爱。本报陆续收到史炳堂、冯磊、冯元勋、黄人晓、余作民等同志的来稿、来信，称赞这本书对读者们有极大的教育意义。
    北京工业学院史炳堂说：“这不是一本普通的书，这是方志敏同志在被国民党反动派关在监狱里时写的书。方志敏同志在监狱里没有写他个人的事情，而是写帝国主义怎样侵略、污辱我们伟大、可爱的母亲——祖国，他号召大家打倒帝国主义，消灭反动派，建设我们伟大的祖国。这充分地表现了一个共产党员的崇高品质，和他对祖国光明前途的无限信心。”
    中国人民志愿军某部冯元勋说：“志敏同志在随时可能被处死的监狱里，不但没有考虑个人的生死，反而说：‘假使能使中国民族得到解放，那我又何惜于我这一条蚁命！’这是多么伟大崇高的自我牺牲精神，值得我们去学习。”
    天津重庆道五十五号黄人晓说：“我读了这本书后，感到我们今天所处的幸福时代，是我们无数先烈流血牺牲所换来的。现在，我们的国家在毛主席的领导下，已经‘可以无愧色地立在人类的面前’了，但这仅仅是一个开始，需要我们继承先烈的遗志，不断地努力。”
    华北军区军械部财务科余作民说：“书中的每一个字如同一颗颗的炸弹，不断地在我眼前爆炸、开花。越看下去，热血越澎湃，震荡得越厉害。那一个有血性的人，能不为我们的祖国横遭帝国主义的摧残而义愤填膺？这一篇放射强烈的愤怒火焰的文字，有力地警告了侵略者：中国人民是不可侮的，中华民族是不可侮的，帝国主义强盗一定会完蛋！这篇文章还有力地提醒人们：勇敢地战斗下去，中国才能巩固胜利。”
