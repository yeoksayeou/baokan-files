Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: Indian representative Singh, who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, expressed his impressions of his visit to China before returning home. The full text is as follows:

Dear friends:

As a writer, language is my capital. However, to thank you for your abundant hospitality and friendly consideration, it is clear that I cannot do it with my language capital. Therefore, I do not want to do what I cannot do, and I want to put it aside for the time being, and wait for my future actions to prove how much I love you, respect you, love and respect your country, and everything you advocate.

You have filled my short time with you with various scenes, hopes and inspirations, love and friendship. It makes me feel that this period is much longer than five weeks.

You will naturally want to know what my impression was during this period. My impression is the happiest. What impresses me most is the material and spiritual cleanliness of your cities, and the simplicity, enthusiasm and loveliness of your women.

I have visited your factories, nurseries, prisons, hospitals, schools and universities. To say that they are all complete may be an understatement of your construction plans. From now on, in just five years, everything in your country will change. Your speed of expansion and development is rapid. So I would like to say this, I am indeed delighted and encouraged by everything I have seen in China. I have no doubt that you have the determination and the means to accomplish what the world still considers miracles.

Your engineering construction to control rivers is simply a miracle, and it is impossible to believe without seeing it with your own eyes; mobilizing millions of people is a remarkable organizational work.

Your patience and determination are unmatched. You loudly demand free trade, but you are blockaded; you long for peace, but you are harassed by cruel wars; you call for friendship and cooperation, but you are surrounded by spies and saboteurs. However, you are still moving forward as if nothing happened. Your songs, dances, and the quiet hard work everywhere are extremely enviable. You have cleared all traces of imperialism from your country's beautiful land so thoroughly, which is worthy of the highest praise. Only here, I, as an Asian, can walk freely and not hear the sound of European "royal arrogance."

While you are involved in a cruel war, you have also built thousands of miles of railways, tens of thousands of houses, and hundreds of thousands of nurseries and sanatoriums for the welfare of the working people. Undoubtedly, you are moving towards victory. Victory will be yours. The political leaders in any other place cannot match your leaders in humility, efficiency, and honesty. I pay tribute to you, to the leader of your leaders, the great Mao Zedong; all lovers of humanity sincerely express their love and respect for the great Mao Zedong.

I want to bring your hand of cooperation to our compatriots, and as long as my compatriots hold your hand tightly, the desert of imperialism will become a world of hope and happiness.

Long live China!

Long live India!

Let us work together to turn this scarred and exploited world into a happy family for mankind!

    印度代表辛格返国前发表访问我国观感
    【新华社十一日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的印度代表辛格，在返国前发表访华观感。全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    作为一个作家来说，语言就是我的本钱。然而，要感谢你们丰盛的招待和友爱的体贴，显然用我的语言的本钱是不能做到的。因此，我也不想来做我所不能胜任的工作，我想将它暂搁一下，待我将来的行动来证明我是如何地爱你们，尊敬你们，爱和尊敬你们的国家，和你们所主张的一切。
    你们使我与你们相处的这短短的时间里充满了各色的景物，希望和灵感，爱和友谊。使我觉得这时期比五个星期要长得多。
    你们自然会想知道在这期间中我的印象是怎样。我的印象确是最快乐的。我印象最深的是你们城市的在物质上和精神上的清洁，和你们妇女们的单纯，热情和可爱。
    我参观过你们的工厂、托儿所、监狱、医院、学校和大学。如果说他们都很完备的话，也许会是过低估价你们的建设计划。从现在起，只要五年你们国家里的一切就都会改观的。你们扩充和发展的速度是飞快的。所以我愿意这样说，我确实为我在中国所见到的一切而感到欢欣鼓舞。我毫不怀疑你们有决心和办法来作成世界上仍然认为是奇迹的东西。
    你们控制河流的工程建设简直是奇迹，不亲眼看见是不可能相信的；动员起来数百万人是一件了不起的组织工作。
    你们的忍耐性和坚决性是无人能比的。你们高声要求自由贸易，但是你们却被封锁着；你们渴望和平，但是你们却被残酷的战争所骚扰着；你们号召友善与合作，但是你们却被间谍和破坏者们所包围。可是，你们却仍是若无其事地前进着。你们的歌曲、舞蹈、和到处可见的安静的勤劳，是极端令人羡慕的。你们从你们国家美丽的大地上，把所有帝国主义的痕迹清除得这样彻底，这是值得最高的赞扬的。只有在这里，我，作为一个亚洲人，才可能自由行走，听不到那种欧洲人的“皇家狂妄”的声音。
    在你们被卷入一个残酷的战争中，你们同时已修建了千哩的铁路，成千成万的房屋，为劳动人民的福利，修起了成百成千的托儿所、休养所。无疑义地，你们正走向胜利。胜利就要是你们的了。别的任何地方的政治领袖们，在谦逊上，在效率上，在诚实上，都比不上你们的领袖们。我向你们，向你们的领袖的领袖，伟大的毛泽东致敬；所有人类的爱好者都衷心地流露出他们对伟大的毛泽东的敬爱。
    我要将你们伸出合作的手带给我们的同胞，我的同胞只要紧握你们的手，这样，帝国主义的沙漠就会变成希望与幸福的世界。
    中国万岁！
    印度万岁！
    让我们一起把这个伤痕累累和被剥削的世界变成人类快乐的家庭！
