    The Situation and Problems of the Li Chenggui Mutual Aid Team
    By our reporter Lu Sheng
        (I)
    Li Chenggui (formerly mistakenly written as "Li Chenggui"), the nationally renowned model for high rice yield, lives in Xiafang Village, Baofeng Township, Liling County, Hunan Province. In late May, when I visited Baofeng Township, I saw that the rice seedlings here had grown to be over two feet tall. The early rice of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team grew even taller, with wide leaves and thick stalks, and had already begun to sprout. When I met Li Chenggui, he and the team members were busy transplanting late rice. Afterwards, he led me to visit their rice paddies. As we walked to the edge of the village, I saw a patch of rice paddies that was distinctly different from the others. The spacing between the rice plants was very uniform; no matter where you stood in the paddy, the rice plants were aligned in rows. The deep green rice leaves and the round, thick stalks were pleasing to the eye. Stroking the robust rice seedlings he had cultivated himself, Li Chenggui told me, "This is the high-yield field where we produced over 1,300 catties of grain last year. This year's seedlings are growing even better than last year's, with each clump of seedlings having 50 to 60 tillers after dividing. We guarantee that we can complete this year's high-yield plan."
    In Liling County, Li Chenggui has become a distinct banner in agricultural production. Farmers in Liling County, even teenagers, know that Li Chenggui is a model for high rice yield and recognize that to increase the yield per unit area of rice paddies, they must learn from Li Chenggui's experience. On the more than fifty-mile road from Liling County to Baofeng Township, I saw that many of the rice seedlings along the road were of the "red foot" rice variety cultivated by Li Chenggui, and they were all growing very robustly. I interviewed farmers working in the rice paddies along the way, and they all said, "This year, because we learned from Li Chenggui's high-yield experience, the rice seedlings are growing better than last year's."
        (II)
    Why do the rice seedlings of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team grow so well? I interviewed local cadres and members of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team separately. From their conversations, the main reasons are:
    First, the mutual aid team was developed and consolidated, conservative ideas were overcome, and a patriotic production increase campaign was launched. In the past, county and district cadres and farmers had serious conservative ideas in agricultural production and did not believe that the yield per unit area could be increased. After Li Chenggui attended the provincial labor model conference last winter, he understood the principle that organizing can increase production, so he set about rectifying the mutual aid team and overcoming conservative ideas. The mutual aid team he originally led was a temporary labor exchange group organized by well. This group played a significant role in drought prevention last year; however, the composition of the team members was complex (including rich peasants who had served as puppet village chiefs and lazy people who made a profession of superstition), and many people were afraid of having to bear more burdens after the increase in production. Li Chenggui promoted the government's policy of rewarding high yields with his own example, and at the same time mobilized everyone to voluntarily unite and organize a year-round mutual aid team. The team members recognized that organizing could overcome difficulties and produce more grain, initially dispelling conservative ideas and opening the way for a comprehensive increase in yield per unit area. Li Chengjiu also produced over 1,200 catties of rice per mu last year, but because he did not understand the government's policies, he only reported producing over 700 catties, and did not plan to increase production further. After Li Chenggui's publicity and mobilization, he joined the mutual aid team and not only openly discussed his actual yield from last year, but also resolved to strive for 1,400 catties per mu this year. After they broke with conservative ideas, they set a high-yield target for 1952, requiring the entire team's rice fields to produce an average of 1,250 catties of rice per mu, and the five mu of high-yield fields to create a new record of producing more than 1,500 catties of rice per mu. Later, after careful research, they raised the high-yield target again, requiring the entire team's rice fields to produce an average of 1,400 catties of rice per mu (including three mu of late rice, producing 800 catties per mu), and the five mu of high-yield fields to create a new record of producing 1,600 catties of rice per mu. Under the publicity and influence of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team, many farmers in Baofeng Township who had very serious conservative ideas also changed. For example, Xia Putian had two mu of rice paddies last year that were estimated to have produced at least 3,000 catties of rice; however, because he did not understand the government's policy of rewarding high yields, he did not dare to report the actual amount. After hearing Li Chenggui's publicity, he regretted it very much and resolved to strive for another high yield this year. Yao Guoqing also complained that he should not have underreported his yield. He organized a mutual aid team to launch a patriotic production increase competition with the Li Chenggui mutual aid team.
    Second, on the basis of organizing, farming techniques were improved. Their method of managing seedling fields has been greatly improved compared to last year. Because they plant two seasons of rice, early and late, the sowing period is much earlier than single-season rice, so preventing cold water from rotting the seedlings is most important. In order to maintain a certain temperature in the seedling field, they first put water in an empty field above the seedling field, and after the water is heated by exposure to the sun, they put it into the seedling field. In order to ensure that the seedlings do not rot, they do not leave the seedling field day or night; if they find that the weather is changing, they use various seedling protection methods to manage them at any time. In this way, not only did none of their seedlings rot, but they also grew very quickly. In terms of cultivation, although this year is still two plows, three harrows, and one leveling, it is plowed five fen deeper than last year (3.5 cun last year, 4 cun this year), and the amount of fertilizer applied is also more than last year. Last year, they applied more than 30 dan of various fertilizers per mu, and this year they applied more than 60 dan, and also increased fertilizers with more phosphorus and potassium. At the same time, they also bought some chemical fertilizers, ready to supplement the rice fields in the team that are short of fertilizer at any time. In terms of transplanting, because of organization, women participated in field labor, and this year they transplanted well and quickly. Last year, during labor exchange, male and female labor was not well coordinated. When transplanting, they only cared about transplanting, and after transplanting, they applied "An Dou Ash" ("An Dou Ash" is made of cow dung ash accumulated in the previous year and other ashes. When applying, they use their hands to take a pinch and place it next to the seedlings, using the heat of the cow dung ash to maintain the temperature of the seedling base so that the seedlings can grow quickly), so the seedlings could not quickly get fertilizer and heat. This year, it is "men transplanting in front, women spreading ash behind," so the seedlings quickly got fertilizer and heat, so the seedlings grow particularly well. At the same time, they also abolished the old habits of "five wines, three meals, and eight morning smokes" during transplanting in the past, and used the money saved to buy more than 2,000 catties of fertilizer. In terms of pest control, they implemented the principle of "prevention is more important than cure," so the rice seedlings have not been damaged at all. The biggest pests of rice seedlings here are rice stem borers and locusts. In order to prevent these two pests, all the women of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team, under the leadership of Li Chenggui's wife, Liu Biyun, pulled out the rice stumps and burned all the rice stem borers hidden in the rice stumps to death. As soon as the weather warmed up this spring, everyone paid attention to catching rice stem borer moths. When transplanting, male and female team members carried a matchbox or glass bottle with them to catch rice stem borer moths. After transplanting, they also put many rape dry branches or dry rice straw in each rice field to lure rice stem borer moths to lay eggs on them, and then burned these dry rice straw. This is changed and burned frequently, which can reduce the breeding of rice stem borers. They also have many new improvements in terms of mid-cultivation, fertilization, topdressing, and irrigation. In addition, their team also repaired a large pond last winter and this spring, and deepened a well (the wells here are like a small pond to suit the use of dragon bone waterwheels). Now the whole team has two cattle-powered waterwheels, three manpower-powered waterwheels, and one "Liberation-style" waterwheel, and is equipped with two good water buffaloes (owned by the whole team) specially for pulling the waterwheels. They said, "If there is a drought, we guarantee that it doesn't matter if it doesn't rain for eighty days."
        (III)
    The fact that the Li Chenggui mutual aid team conducted rectification last winter, developed a temporary labor exchange group into a year-round mutual aid team, overcame conservative ideas, and improved farming techniques is the basic reason why they have been able to make excellent achievements in the patriotic production increase campaign this year. Although Li Chenggui and the members of the mutual aid team he leads have recognized that organizing can overcome difficulties and increase production, they have not clearly recognized that this is the only way for farmers to get rid of exploitation and poverty and move towards prosperity. For example, seeing that the rich peasant Xia Fajian had more farm tools, they once allowed him to join the mutual aid team and carry out illegal exploitation within the team. Xia Fajian's motives for joining the mutual aid team were: (1) to raise his political status in the countryside in the name of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team; (2) he had little labor power and wanted to use the mutual aid team for illegal exploitation; (3) he had surplus grain and idle money and wanted to take advantage of the difficulty that the mutual aid team members temporarily had no food to eat to lend money at usurious rates in disguise. At that time, all the members of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team did not recognize his conspiracy. After he joined the mutual aid team, they also entrusted him with the work of bookkeeping and even elected him as the deputy team leader. When Xia Fajian was recording work points, he used the method of "work for work without recording work points, long work records work points" to exploit others. This method seems fair on the surface, but it actually deceived everyone. When settling accounts, no one could remember who owed whom work, so he divided it equally according to the land area, causing households with more labor power to suffer losses, while he had more land and less labor power, so he took advantage. It was not until April 9 this year, under the impetus of the poor peasants in the team and the guidance of the cadres, that Xia Fajian withdrew from the mutual aid team.
    The Li Chenggui mutual aid team also made mistakes in treating poor peasants in difficulty. Team member Li Xianzhe did not have a single field before the land reform, and was allocated 2.5 mu of rice paddies during the land reform. He was very happy and eagerly asked to organize mutual aid production. However, his foundation was too empty, and he lacked farm tools and food. On the one hand, he had to plant the fields well, and on the other hand, he had to engage in sideline production to earn rice to eat. The Li Chenggui mutual aid team not only did not help Li Xianzhe solve this difficulty, but often gave him some unrealistic criticisms and accusations. Once, Li Xianzhe only ate one meal a day, and he was very tired from pushing his cart to transport goods. He did not go to the team meeting, and the team criticized him for "not obeying discipline." Li Xianzhe had nothing to eat and could not borrow grain, so he sold more than 2,000 catties of accumulated fertilizer. When Li Chenggui found out, he only criticized him for not selling fertilizer, but did not study why he sold fertilizer. Therefore, Li Xianzhe wanted to withdraw from the team a few days ago.
        (IV)
    The cadres working in this township should be responsible for the fact that these shortcomings of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team were not overcome early. The cadres who helped Baofeng Township (this township is one of the key high-yield townships in Liling County) and the Li Chenggui mutual aid team provided more help in terms of technology, but not enough help in terms of political and ideological education; there were more general calls and meeting arrangements, but rarely did they truly start from the ideological reality of each farmer, grasp every specific fact, and carry out patriotic education and class education. This spring, the local superior leading organs gave the cadres working in this township a task: the Li Chenggui mutual aid team "is only allowed to be run well, not allowed to be run badly." In order to run the Li Chenggui mutual aid team well, instead of thinking about strengthening the political and ideological education of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team members and gradually improving and consolidating this team, they wanted to merge the Liu Qikui mutual aid team, which had just voluntarily united this spring, into the Li Chenggui mutual aid team (the Liu Qikui mutual aid team is a better mutual aid team in Baofeng Township at present). They believed that as long as the organizational form and organizational members changed, the mutual aid team would be run well. Because both teams were unwilling, and the Liling County Committee of the Communist Party of China also believed that it should not be done at present, the merger was not implemented.
    When Xia Fajian was allowed to withdraw from the mutual aid team, the leading cadres should have seized this specific fact, launched all the team members to conduct in-depth discussions, and let everyone thoroughly understand the essence of Xia Fajian's illegal exploitation; at the same time, through this specific fact, they should have told the farmers that only by truly organizing according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit can they gradually overcome difficulties and move towards prosperity; allowing people like Xia Fajian to join the mutual aid team will not only not help everyone solve difficulties, but will be exploited by him. However, the local cadres did not do this.
    Local cadres lack planning for cultivating the Li Chenggui mutual aid team. Sometimes they take over everything, and sometimes they let things go. For example, the work point evaluation and recording meeting of the mutual aid team is mostly convened by the cadres. On the other hand, the local cadres knew long ago that the rich peasant Xia Fajian was openly carrying out illegal exploitation in the mutual aid team, but they never raised any objections. It was not until April this year, when reporters from various newspapers visited the Li Chenggui mutual aid team and raised opinions on this matter, that they paid attention to this issue.
    The enthusiasm of the cadres working here is high. Comrade Wang Di, who is responsible for technical guidance, often carefully studies technical management issues in the rice paddies with the farmers, regardless of whether it is raining or sunny. Deputy County Head Zhang Shen and the male and female comrades working in this township still maintain the spirit of hard work and simplicity from the Anti-Japanese War, live with the farmers, help them plant fields, catch insects, and often jointly study methods to increase yield per unit area. However, this alone is far from enough. As a leader, there is an even more important responsibility. In addition to continuing to carry forward this spirit of hard work and simplicity, they should also strengthen policy learning, deeply understand the thoughts of each team member of the Li Chenggui mutual aid team, grasp every specific fact, carry out political and ideological education, point out the correct direction for them to move forward; inspire each mutual aid team member to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity; and systematically and planned (rather than spontaneously) and regularly (rather than temporarily) summarize and promote their high-yield experience. As long as they can do this, the Li Chenggui mutual aid team will gradually consolidate and improve, and play a greater role in the patriotic production increase campaign.

    李呈桂互助组的情况和问题
    本报记者　鲁生
        （一）
    全国著名的水稻丰产模范李呈桂（前误为“李承桂”），家住湖南省醴陵县保丰乡夏坊村。五月下旬，我去保丰乡访问时，看到这里的稻苗已长到二尺多高了。李呈桂互助组的早稻长得更高，叶宽杆粗，已经开始抽穗。我见到李呈桂时，他和组员们正在紧张地插晚稻。随后，他就引我去参观他们的稻田。走到村边时，我看到有一片稻田和别的稻田截然不同。稻子的株行距十分齐整；随便站在稻田的任何一处看，稻株都能成行。深绿色的稻叶，圆粗的茎杆，看了令人喜欢。李呈桂抚摸着他亲手培养起的茁壮的稻苗告诉我说：“这就是我去年生产一千三百多斤谷子的丰产田。今年稻苗比去年长得更好，每蔸秧分蘖后就有五十到六十多棵。我们保证能完成今年的丰产计划。”
    在醴陵县，李呈桂已成了农业生产上的一面鲜明的旗帜。醴陵县的农民们，甚至十几岁的儿童，都知道李呈桂是水稻丰产模范，都认识到要提高稻田的单位面积产量，必须学习李呈桂的经验。从醴陵县城到保丰乡的五十多里路上，我看到路两旁的稻秧，许多都是采用李呈桂培育出来的“红脚”稻种，而且都长得很茁壮。我曾沿途访问正在稻田中工作的农民，他们都说：“今年因为学习了李呈桂的丰产经验，所以稻苗比去年都长得好。”
        （二）
    李呈桂互助组的稻苗为什么长得特别好呢？我分别访问了当地干部和李呈桂互助组的组员，从他们的谈话来看，主要的原因是：
    第一、发展和巩固了互助组，克服了保守思想，展开了爱国增产竞赛运动。过去、县、区干部和农民在农业生产方面有严重的保守思想，不相信能够提高单位面积产量。李呈桂去年冬天参加全省劳动模范会议以后，懂得了组织起来能够增加生产的道理，就着手整顿互助组和克服保守思想。他原来领导的互助组是以井为单位组织起来的临时变工组。这个组在去年防旱时曾起了很大作用；但组员成分复杂
  （有当过伪保长的富农和专以迷信为职业的懒汉），而且很多人怕增产以后多负担。李呈桂一面以自己的实例宣传政府奖励丰产的政策，一面又动员大家自愿结合，组织常年互助组。组员认识了组织起来能够克服困难、多打粮食，初步打消了保守思想，给全面地提高单位面积产量打开了道路。李呈玖去年每亩稻田也曾生产一千二百多斤，但因不了解政府的政策，只说生产了七百多斤，而且不打算再提高产量了。经过李呈桂宣传动员，他参加了互助组，不但把去年实产量公开谈出来，而且下决心在今年争取每亩生产一千四百斤。他们打破了保守思想之后，订出了一九五二年的丰产目标，要求全组水稻田每亩平均产稻谷一千二百五十斤，五亩丰产田创造每亩产稻谷一千五百斤以上的新纪录。后来，他们经过仔细研究，又提高了丰产目标，要求全组水稻田每亩平均产稻谷一千四百斤（内晚稻三亩，每亩产八百斤），五亩丰产田创造每亩产稻谷一千六百斤的新纪录。在李呈桂互助组的宣传和影响下，保丰乡许多保守思想很严重的农民也转变了。如夏普田，去年曾有二亩稻田估计至少生产了三千斤稻谷；但因不了解政府奖励丰产的政策，没敢实报。他听到李呈桂的宣传，非常后悔，决心争取今年再丰产。姚国庆也埋怨自己不该不实报产量。他组织了一个互助组，要和李呈桂互助组展开爱国增产竞赛。
    第二，在组织起来的基础上，改进了耕作技术。他们管理秧田的方法，比去年有很大改进。因为他们种的是早晚两季稻，播种期比单季稻要早得多，所以防止水冷烂秧最为重要。为了使秧田内保持一定的温度，他们在秧田的上一块空田里先放进水，等水在阳光曝晒下提高温度以后，再放到秧田里。为了保证秧苗不烂，他们白天黑夜都不离开秧田；发现天气有变化，随时采用各种护秧办法来管理。这样，他们的秧苗不但没烂一棵，而且生长得很快。在耕作方面，今年虽然还是二耕三耙一荡平，但比去年深耕了五分（去年三寸半，今年四寸），施肥量也比去年增多了。去年每亩上各种肥料三十多担，今年上六十多担，而且增加了含磷含钾较多的肥料。同时，还买了一些化学肥料，准备给组里缺肥的稻田随时补用。在插秧方面，由于组织起来，妇女参加了田间劳动，今年插得又好又快。去年变工时男女劳动没有很好配合，插秧时只管插秧，插秧后才施“安蔸灰”（“安蔸灰”是用头年堆积的牛粪灰及其他灰类做成的，施用时用手一摄一摄地点放在秧苗的旁边，利用牛粪灰的热力，保持秧蔸的温度，使秧苗能生长得快），这样就不能使秧苗很快得到肥力和热力。今年是“男人插秧前面走，妇女撒灰后面跟”，使秧苗很快就得到了肥力和热力，所以秧苗长得格外好。同时他们还废除了过去插秧时“五酒三饭八朝烟”的旧习惯，把节约的钱买了两千多斤肥料。在除虫方面，他们执行了“防重于治”的方针，使稻苗没有受到一点损害。这里稻苗最怕螟、蝗两大虫害。为了防止这两种虫害，李呈桂互助组全组妇女在李呈桂的妻子刘碧云领导下，拔掉了禾蔸，把隐藏在禾蔸里的螟虫全部烧死了。今春天气刚暖，大家就注意了捕捉螟蛾。插秧时，男女组员每人身边都带上一个火柴盒或玻璃瓶捉螟蛾。插秧以后，他们又在每块秧田里放了许多油菜干枝或干稻草，引诱螟蛾到上面去下卵，以后就把这些干稻草烧掉。这样经常换经常烧，就能减少螟虫的繁殖。在中耕和施肥、追肥方面，灌溉方面，他们也有许多新的改进。此外，他们组在去冬今春还修好一口大塘，挖深一个水井（这里的水井为了适合龙骨水车用，都像一个小水塘），现在全组有两部牛力水车，三部人力水车，还有一部“解放式”水车，并配备了两条好水牛（全组公有的）专拉水车。他们说：“如遇天旱，我们保证八十天不下雨也没关系。”
        （三）
    李呈桂互助组在去年冬天进行整顿，把临时变工组发展为常年互助组，克服了保守思想，改进了耕作技术，这是他们今年在爱国增产运动中能够作出优良成绩的基本原因。李呈桂和他领导的互助组组员们虽然认识到了组织起来能够克服困难，增加生产，但还没有明确认识到这是农民摆脱剥削与贫困走向富裕的唯一道路。例如他们看到富农夏发坚有较多的农具，就曾经允许他参加了互助组，在组内进行非法剥削。夏发坚参加互助组的动机是，（一）想借李呈桂互助组名义提高他在农村里的政治地位；（二）他劳力少，想利用互助组进行非法剥削；（三）他有余粮和闲钱，想利用互助组员暂时没粮食吃的困难，变相地放高利贷。那时，李呈桂互助组的全体组员，没有认识到他的阴谋，在他参加互助组以后，还把记账的工作交给他，甚至选他当副组长。夏发坚在记工账时，就用“工顶工不记账，长了工记账”的办法剥削别人。这个办法表面上看似乎也公平，其实是骗了大家。到结账时，谁也记不得谁长谁的工，他就按地亩来平分，使劳力多的户吃了亏，他地多劳力少，占了便宜。直到今年四月九日，在组内贫农的推动和干部的指导下，才让夏发坚退出了互助组。
    李呈桂互助组对待有困难的贫农也曾发生过错误。组员李先趾，在土地改革以前一分田也没有，在土地改革时分到二亩五分水稻田。他心里十分高兴，迫切要求组织起来互助生产。但他的底子太空，农具粮食都很缺乏，一面要把田种好，一面还得搞副业生产赚米吃。李呈桂互助组不但没有帮助李先趾解决这个困难，而且常常给他一些不合实际的批评和指责。有一次李先趾一天只吃了一顿饭，推脚（推小车运货）回来又很累，没有去组里开会，组里就批评他“不遵守纪律”。李先趾没有吃的，又借不到谷，就把积的肥料卖了两千多斤；李呈桂知道了，光批评他不该卖肥料，却不研究他为什么卖肥料。因此，李先趾在前些天曾要退组。
        （四）
    李呈桂互助组的这些缺点没有及早克服，在这个乡工作的干部是应当负责的。帮助保丰乡（这个乡是醴陵县丰产重点乡之一）和李呈桂互助组工作的干部，在技术方面帮助较多，在政治思想教育方面帮助不够；一般的号召和开会布置较多，而很少真正从每个农民的思想实际出发，抓住每一件具体事实，进行爱国主义教育和阶级教育。今年春天，当地上级领导机关曾给在这乡工作的干部一个任务：李呈桂互助组“只准办好，不准办坏”。他们为了把李呈桂互助组办好，不是想法对李呈桂互助组组员加强政治思想教育，逐步提高和巩固这个组，却想把今年春天刚刚自愿结合起来的刘起逵互助组合并到李呈桂互助组（刘起逵互助组是保丰乡当前较好的一个互助组）。他们认为：只要在组织形式和组织成员上起了变化，互助组就会办好。因为两组都不愿意，同时中共醴陵县委也认为在目前还不应该这么作，才没有实行合并。
    在让夏发坚退出互助组时，领导干部本应抓住这一具体事实，发动全体组员深入展开讨论，让大家彻底认识夏发坚进行非法剥削的本质；同时通过这一具体事实告诉农民：只有真正地按照自愿两利的原则组织起来，才能逐渐克服困难走向富裕；让夏发坚这样的人加入互助组，不但不能帮助大家解决困难，反而会受他的剥削。可是，当地干部却没有这样作。
    当地干部对于培养李呈桂互助组，缺乏计划性。有时包办代替，有时放任自流。例如：互助组的评工记工会，还是干部出面召集的多。另一方面，富农夏发坚钻在互助组里公开地进行非法剥削，当地干部很早就知道，但却一直没有提过意见。直到今年四月，各报记者访问李呈桂互助组时，对这件事提出意见以后，他们才注意了这个问题。
    在这里工作的干部们的热情是高的。负责技术指导的王倜同志，不论雨天和晴天，经常和农民们在稻田里细心地研究每一个时期的技术管理问题。张伸副县长及在这乡工作的男女同志们，仍保持着抗日战争时期的坚苦朴素作风，和农民们生活在一起，帮助他们种田、捉虫，并经常共同研究提高单位面积产量的办法。但是，只是这样，是远远不够的。做为一个领导者，还有更重要的责任。他们除了应当继续发扬这种坚苦朴素的作风之外，还应加强政策学习，深入了解李呈桂互助组每个组员的思想，抓住每一件具体事实，进行政治思想教育，给他们指出前进的正确方向；启发每一个互助组员发挥积极性和创造性；并有组织有计划地（而不是自流地）经常地（而不是一时地）总结和推广他们的丰产经验。只要能这样做，李呈桂互助组就会逐渐地巩固和健全起来，在爱国增产竞赛运动中发挥更大的作用。
