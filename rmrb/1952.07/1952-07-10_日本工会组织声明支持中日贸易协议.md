Xinhua News Agency, dated the 9th: A delayed dispatch from Tokyo: Fourteen Japanese labor organizations, including the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, and the Japanese Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions, jointly issued a statement on June 2 supporting the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. An excerpt of the statement is as follows:

    With Japan's rearmament, Japan's economic autonomy has been deprived, and peaceful industries have been forced onto the path of collapse. The people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Now the whole nation deeply feels that there is no way out without stopping rearmament and without trading with China and the Soviet Union. Especially for trade with China and the Soviet Union, both workers and capitalists are eagerly hoping for it like praying for rain in a drought.

    The Liberal Party's Yoshida government suppresses this hope of the people. From the standpoint of assisting war, it has accepted a trade system even stricter than the U.S. Battle Act, prohibiting Japanese people from going to China and the Soviet Union. Since the conclusion of the separate peace treaty, the Yoshida government has continued to be hostile to China and the Soviet Union.

    This, like the interference in Japan's internal affairs manifested in the statement by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Murphy, is intolerable to all Japanese people who love independence.

    At this time, on June 1, 1952, China's Nan Hanchen and Japan's Takayoshi Kora, Kisuke Miyakoshi, and Keizo Hoashi signed the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Beijing with a total value of 60 million pounds. This matter has promoted friendly relations between the peace-loving people of China and Japan. In this regard, the Sino-Japanese trade agreement is of extremely great significance. We express our sincere congratulations.

    We have long hoped to cooperate with the nations of Asia on the basis of equal and mutually beneficial economic relations without political manipulation, and on the basis of friendly relations for striving for peace and improving the people's living standards. This is the first step taken, and at a time when plans for aggression and colonization are being increasingly exposed, we believe that the Sino-Japanese trade agreement will receive the strong support of the people nationwide.

    From now on, the relationship between the people of China and Japan should be made closer. In terms of promoting the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions, we, the working class, should launch more active activities and stand at the forefront of the national liberation and international friendship national movements.

    The statement also put forward the following slogans: Send Japanese business representatives to Beijing to materialize the Sino-Japanese trade agreement! Oppose interference in Japan's internal affairs through the Battle Act! Smash the import and export control order! Abolish the "peace treaty" and the "security treaty"!

### 日本工会组织声明支持中日贸易协议

    日本工会组织声明支持中日贸易协议
    【新华社九日讯】东京迟到消息：全日本产业别工会会议、全日本金属工会、世界工会联合会日本联络事务局等十四个日本工会组织，在六月二日联合发表声明，支持中日贸易协议。声明摘要如下：
    随着日本的重新武装，日本的经济自主性被剥夺了，和平工业也被迫走上崩溃的道路。国民生活日益困苦。现在全国人民深切感到不停止重整军备，不和中国与苏联进行贸易，就没有活路。特别是对于中、苏贸易，工人和资本家都像旱天求雨一样地热望着。
    自由党吉田政府压制人民的这种希望，由协助战争的立场，接受了比美国巴特尔法更严格的贸易制度，禁止日本人民到中国和苏联去。自从缔结单独和约以来，吉田政府继续敌视中、苏两国。
    这和美国驻日大使墨菲的声明中所表现的干涉日本内政一样，都是爱好独立的日本人所不能容忍的。
    在这样的时候，一九五二年六月一日，中国的南汉宸和日本的高良富、宫腰喜助、帆足计三人在北京签订了总额六千万英镑的中日贸易协议。这件事推进了中日两国爱好和平的人民之间的友好关系。在这方面，中日贸易协议是有极端重大的意义的。我们表示衷心庆贺。
    我们早就希望在平等互惠而没有政治性操纵的经济关系基础上、在为争取和平及提高国民生活水平的友好关系基础上，与亚洲各民族合作。这次走了第一步，在这侵略和殖民地化的计划日益暴露出来的时候，我们相信中日贸易协议是会受到全国人民大力支持的。
    今后应该使中日两国人民的关系更加密切，就推进亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动而论，我们工人阶级应该展开更积极的活动，站在民族解放、国际友好的国民运动的前列。
    声明并提出了下列口号：派遣日本工商业代表到北京去，使中日贸易协议具体化！反对以巴特尔法干涉日本内政！粉碎进出口管理令！废除“和约”和“安全条约”！
