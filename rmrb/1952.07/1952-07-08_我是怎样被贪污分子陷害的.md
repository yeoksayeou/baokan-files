How I Was Framed by Grafters
Liao Zhongyi (as told by Chen Keng)

My name is Liao Zhongyi, and I am a salesman for the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company's Shanxi Provincial Branch (hereinafter referred to as the Coal Construction Branch). In February of last year, because I reported the corrupt behavior of certain cadres in the company, I was framed by grafters and imprisoned. After being released from prison, I was fired from the company and placed under surveillance as a counter-revolutionary element. Later, because I couldn't make a living in Taiyuan, I returned home to engage in production. However, during the great "Three-Anti" movement, my problem was finally clarified, and the People's Government even sent someone to Sichuan to bring me back.

In August 1950, I was admitted to the training class run by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. After completing my studies, I was assigned to Shanxi and introduced by the Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce to work in the coal yard of the Coal Construction Branch, inspecting and identifying coal quality. Later, the factory assigned me to sell coal and issue invoices. In February 1951, the organization transferred me back to the company's business section. During the handover, I found several discrepancies in the accounts, which I reported in writing to the company manager, Shao Xi. Manager Shao ignored it. Due to responsibility, I reported this matter to the Department of Commerce, which sent two comrades from the security section, Dong Jinzhang and Cui Zhendong, to the company to hold an investigation meeting. Those who attended the meeting included: Li Laitang (former head of the business section, now head of the business department), Han Zhihua (former deputy head of the personnel section, now deputy head of the secretarial section), Li Hui (secretary), Lü Zhisheng (coal yard director), and Xu Bingcheng, Zhang Zhishuan, Zhao Ronggui, Wu Zhende, and Liang Cunxiang. At the investigation meeting, I reported on the matter of private merchant Meng Xianshun obtaining state coal through fraudulent means. The company stipulated that the ratio of coal to charcoal sold should be four parts coal and six parts charcoal for every ten tons. However, Meng Xianshun bought more than twenty tons of charcoal without taking even one ton of coal dust. Later, when he came to buy charcoal again, I questioned him, "Why aren't you buying according to the regulations?" He said that he was buying according to the regulations. I didn't believe him and asked Director Lü, but he didn't answer. The matter was obvious: something was fishy. I was responsible for selling charcoal and issuing invoices, but Liang Cunxiang had another invoice book in his hand, and they also controlled the goods exit permits. Therefore, Meng Xianshun could get the charcoal out without going through me. In addition, based on their usual behavior, I concluded that there were cases of embezzlement and bribery. But at the meeting, none of them admitted it. Li Laitang, the head of the business section, got angry and said that I was "groundlessly slandering good people." Lü Zhisheng also said, "Liao Zhongyi is not doing it for work, but to make trouble." They wanted to punish me (Note: Li Laitang, Lü Zhisheng, and Liang Cunxiang were all grafters). At the investigation meeting, Dong Jinzhang also believed that there must be corruption involved. He said to me, "Don't be discouraged. They don't admit it now, you must continue to collect materials and report to higher authorities." At that time, I was not feeling well and took a few days of sick leave. Once, when I returned from seeing a doctor at the hospital, I passed by the private Lijun Coal Factory. I went in to inquire about the situation. I said to the owner, Zhang Lijun, "Because I had some problems with the accounts in the factory, I wanted to check the accounts with you. I don't know if that's possible?" He said, "Manager Shao, Director Lü, and Section Chief Li are all good friends of mine, it doesn't matter."

When I returned to the company, Section Chief Li Laitang started scolding me, "Liao Zhongyi, why are you privately checking other people's accounts?" I said, "Didn't you tell me to continue looking for materials at the meeting that day?" He said, "Which one of us at the Coal Construction Company has done you wrong? What good will it do you to investigate him?" I said, "This is a matter of responsibility, it must be clarified." At this time, Li Laitang lost his temper and scolded me, "Whose rice are you eating, the Department of Commerce or the Coal Construction Company? If you're eating the Department of Commerce's rice, pack your luggage and get out!" As he said this, Secretary Li (Li Hui) came in and said, "Section Chief Li, you don't need to talk to him, just send him to the People's Court." Then, Deputy Section Chief Han (Han Zhihua) came in and shouted to Wang Wenxiu, "Detain him!" And so, I was locked up in the room across from the business section. The next afternoon, two comrades from the Public Security Bureau came and, like treating a counter-revolutionary, tied me up and sent me to prison. (Note: According to Li Laitang's own admission at a meeting presided over by Pei Lisheng, chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government on June 14, Shao Xi, Li Laitang, and others, dissatisfied with Liao Zhongyi's reporting of corruption, instigated private merchant Zhang Lijun to accuse Liao Zhongyi of "illegally checking accounts and disrupting social order." Shao Xi, Li Laitang, Li Hui, and others also gave the private merchant ideas and revised the "accusation letter," saying that Liao Zhongyi had committed illegal dereliction of duty, spread rumors, and engaged in sabotage, and had serious political problems. This accusation letter was sent to the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court believed that this was a political case and should be handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Municipal Public Security Bureau then transferred it to the Provincial Public Security Bureau. The Provincial Public Security Bureau then sent someone to arrest Liao Zhongyi.) I was detained in prison for one hundred and thirty days, handcuffed for one hundred and twenty-three days. My arms were swollen. I was interrogated six or seven times. Each interrogation was at my initiative. When requesting a conversation, I stated on a slip of paper: "Why are you locking me up? Locking me up is a waste of the people's millet, it's wrong." This can be verified. Later, they released me. When releasing me, Section Chief Zhi of the Intelligence Section of the Public Security Bureau (Note: Referring to Zhi Peijie, who was a grafter and has been arrested and punished according to the law.) said to me, "You have not committed a great offense, now you are released to go home. You are not allowed to talk nonsense about the situation here; if you do, it will not only be bad for you, but our Public Security Bureau will also be criticized." I knew he was scaring me, so I didn't say much. I knew that this was a mistake made by a few individuals, and it wasn't that the Party and the People's Government were bad.

After leaving prison, the Public Security Bureau sent someone to the West Jiuhu Camp police station to put me under surveillance. I was under surveillance for a total of fifty-nine days. The company had already fired me long ago. Life was really unbearable, so I asked the district government and the municipal government to return to my native place in Sichuan. With the permission of the municipal government, they gave me relief money and bought a train ticket. My wife and I passed through Fenglingdu, Tongguan County in Shaanxi Province, and Baoji City, and then took a carriage through Feng County to Baocheng. By this time, our clothes and luggage were almost sold out, so we were trapped in Baocheng. I went to the county people's government to ask for help, and the county asked me to go to the special commissioner's office to find a solution. On November 22, I arrived at the Nanzheng Special Commissioner's Office. The Civil Affairs Section of the Special Commissioner's Office gave me 36,000 yuan and told me to go to Guangyuan. At this time, my wife fell ill there, and we had no money for treatment, so we couldn't leave. At that time, I felt very sad. Under these circumstances, I went to the Nanzheng Daily to complain. The editor-in-chief Yang and Comrade Zhao Jiabi of the newspaper were very kind to me. They said, "Comrade Liao, we sympathize with you very much. We will forward your materials to the organization, and your problem will definitely be resolved in the future." (Note: According to the responsible comrade of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce: The responsible comrade of the Department of Commerce, upon receiving this material forwarded by the Nanzheng Daily, replied to the Nanzheng Daily with the words that Liao Zhongyi had political problems, had already been fired, and should not be published in the newspaper.) They also helped me write a letter to the Nanzheng Special Commissioner's Office, and the Nanzheng Special Commissioner's Office gave me an additional 24,000 yuan in relief. When I returned to Baocheng, the shop owner asked me to pay 30,000 yuan for the shop fee, and another 70,000 yuan for the previous carriage fee. After paying the bills, we still couldn't leave. I wrote to the Nanzheng Daily again asking for help. Later, when I arrived in Guangyuan County, Sichuan, I found some fellow villagers and borrowed some money. When I arrived in Mianyang, the Mianyang Special Commissioner's Office bought me a bus ticket. I traveled for fifty-nine days and arrived home on the third day of the eleventh lunar month of last year.

Chairman Mao called for the "Three-Anti" movement, and I surmised that the problem would soon be clarified. As I expected, I soon received a letter from the Economy Inspection Committee of the Coal Construction Branch, saying that the facts I had reported in the past were true, and the problem had been basically clarified, and asking me to return to Shanxi. The Department of Commerce also sent a telegram urging me to return to Taiyuan. The Provincial People's Government also sent someone to pick me up. On April 28, I returned to Taiyuan. Comrade Jin Zhiqi of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Director Zhou of the Provincial Government's Department of Commerce, Director Fang of the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government, and many other comrades came to see me, comforted me, and sent me to the hospital for treatment. A few days ago, Comrade Tao Lujia, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, brought up my problem on the radio. I have indescribable gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Government. All this shows that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, those who have been wronged can have their grievances redressed, and a good person will never be wronged. This is completely incomparable to the era of reactionary rule in the past. I am not discouraged, I only see this as a serious test for myself. At the time, I thought: True gold fears no fire, and I believe that my problem will eventually come to light and be completely resolved. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, what I thought has been realized; therefore, I have a greater understanding of the Communist Party and love my country even more. In the future, I will resolutely obey the organization's arrangements and wholeheartedly serve the people to the end.

    我是怎样被贪污分子陷害的
    廖中一述  陈铿记
    我叫廖中一，是中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司（以下简称煤建分公司）的业务员。在去年二月间，因为我检举公司某些干部的贪污行为，被贪污分子陷害，关进了监狱。出狱以后，又被公司开除，还把我当成反革命分子管制起来。后来因为在太原生活没办法，我才回家生产。但是在伟大的“三反”运动中，我的问题终于搞清楚了，人民政府还派人到四川把我接了回来。
    一九五零年八月，我考上了中央人民政府贸易部办的训练班。学习期满后派来山西，由省人民政府商业厅介绍到煤建分公司煤厂担任检车、辨别煤质的工作，后来厂里又派我售炭开发票。一九五一年二月间，组织上把我调回公司业务股。在办移交工作时，我发现有几行账目不碰头，当时就书面报告给公司经理邵熙。邵经理不理。因为责任的关系，我又跑到商业厅报告了这件事情，商业厅人事科派保卫股董锦章、崔振东二人来公司开调查会。参加会的人有：李来堂（前业务股长，现业务科长）、韩治华（前人事股副股长，现秘书科副科长）、李辉（秘书）、吕志绳（煤厂厂长）和徐炳诚、张志拴、赵荣桂、武振德、梁存祥等。在调查会上，我把发现私商孟宪舜套取国家煤炭的事报告了一遍，便开始讨论。当时公司规定出售煤炭十吨的煤和炭的比例是煤四炭六，可是孟宪舜买了二十多吨炭，却连一吨煤末也没有要。后来他又来买炭，我就质问他“为什么不按规定购买”，他说他是按规定购买的。我不信，又问吕厂长，他不答理。事情很明显：这里边有鬼。我负责卖炭开发票，可是梁存祥手里另有发票本子，他们又掌握着货物出门证。所以孟宪舜买的炭不经过我也能够出门。另外，根据他们平日所为，我断定有贪污受贿情形。可是在会上他们谁也不认账。业务股长李来堂反发了脾气，说我是“毫无根据地诬赖好人”。吕志绳也说：“廖中一不是为工作，是为了找麻烦。”他们要处罚我（按：李来堂、吕志绳及梁存祥等都是贪污分子）。在调查会上，董锦章也认为内中必有贪污。他对我说：“你不要灰心。他们现在不承认，你要继续收集材料，向上级反映。”当时我身体不好，请了几天病假。一次，我从医院看病回来，路过私营利军煤厂，我顺便进去了解情况。我对老板张利军说：“因为我在厂里管账出了点毛病，想和你们对对账，不知道可以不可以？”他说：“我和你们邵经理、吕厂长、李股长都是好朋友，没关系。”
    我回到公司，股长李来堂就破口大骂：“廖中一，你为什么私查人家的账？”我说：“那天会上不是叫我继续找材料吗？”他说：“我们煤建公司哪个对不住你，把他清查出来对你究竟有什么好处？”我说：“这是职责问题，必须搞清。”这时李来堂翻了脸，骂我说：“你吃商业厅的饭还是煤建公司的饭？要是吃商业厅的饭，扛起行李给我滚！”说到这里，李秘书（李辉）进来了，他说：“李股长，你不用同他说，干脆把他送到人民法院去。”接着，韩副股长（韩治华）进来喊王文秀：“把他扣起来！”就这样把我关到了业务股对门的房子里。第二天下午，公安厅来了两个同志，像对待反革命分子一样，把我捆起来送进监狱。（按：六月十四日，据李来堂在山西省人民政府裴丽生主席主持的会议上自称：邵熙、李来堂等因不满廖中一检举贪污，教唆私商张利军控告廖中一“非法查账，捣乱社会秩序”。邵熙、李来堂、李辉等，又替私商出主意，修改“控告书”，说廖中一违法失职，造谣破坏，有严重的政治问题。这份控告书被送交市法院。市法院认为这是政治案件，应归市公安局处理。市公安局又转到省公安厅。公安厅遂派人将廖中一扣捕。）我在监狱里被扣押了一百三十天，带了一百二十三天的手铐，胳膊都肿了，被审问过六七次。每次审讯都是我主动地要求的。在要求谈话的时候，我在条子上提出过：“为什么要关我？关我白浪费人民的小米，是错误的。”这是可以查考的。后来就把我放出来了。在放我的时候，公安厅智科长（按：指智培杰，此人贪赃枉法，已被逮捕法办。）对我说：“你无好大的过失，现在放你回家。关于在这里的情形，不准乱说；说了不但对你不好，我们公安厅也要受批评了。”我知道他是吓唬我，就没多说什么。我知道这是少数人办错了事，并不是党和人民政府不好。
    出了监狱，公安厅派人把我送到西缉虎营派出所管制起来。我一共被管制了五十九天。公司也早已把我开除了。生活实在无法维持，我向区政府、市政府请求回四川原籍，经市政府许可，给我发了救济金，买了火车票。我和我老婆途经风陵渡、陕西省潼关县、宝鸡市，然后又坐马车经凤县到了褒城。这时我们的衣裳、行李快要卖净，便困在褒城。我找到县人民政府请求帮助，县里叫我到专署去想办法。十一月二十二日我到了南郑专署。专署民政科发给我三万六千元，叫我二人到广元。这时我老婆病倒在那里，有病没钱，无法起身。当时我心里很难受，在这种情况下，我到南郑日报去控诉，报社的杨编辑主任和赵家璧同志对我很好。他们说：“廖同志，我们对你很表同情。你的材料我们给你转到组织上，将来你的问题一定能解决。”（按：据省人民政府商业厅负责同志谈：商业厅负责同志接到南郑日报转来这个材料，即以廖中一有政治问题，业已开除，不应登报等词答复了南郑日报。）他们还帮助我给南郑专署写了一封信，南郑专署又多救济了我二万四千元。我回到褒城时，店房老板叫我还店费三万元，又还前欠马车费七万元，把钱还了账，仍然无法起程。我又给南郑日报去信请求帮助。后来到了四川广元县，我找到几个同乡，借了一些钱。到了绵阳，绵阳专署又给我买了汽车票。路上走了五十九天，在去年旧历十一月初三才到了家。
    毛主席号召开展“三反”运动，我约摸着问题快要搞清了。不出我所料，不久接到了煤建分公司节约检查委员会给我的信，说我过去检举的是事实，问题基本上搞清了，叫我回山西。商业厅也打电报催我回太原。省人民政府又派人来接我。四月二十八日我回到了太原。中共山西省委会金治齐同志、省府商业厅周厅长、中央贸易部方主任，还有很多同志都来看我，安慰我，又把我送到医院里给治病。前几天，中共山西省委副书记陶鲁笳同志又把我的问题在广播电台上提了出来。对共产党和人民政府，我实在有说不出来的感激。这一切都说明了：在毛主席领导下，有冤的就能伸冤，绝不会屈一个好人，这和过去反动派统治时代万万不能相比。我不灰心丧气，我只把这些看作是对自己的严重考验。当时我就想：真金不怕火炼，相信我的问题定会水落石出，得到彻底解决。由于党的正确领导，我所想的实现了；因此，我更认识了共产党，更热爱自己的国家了。以后我一定要坚决服从组织分配，全心全意地为人民服务到底。
