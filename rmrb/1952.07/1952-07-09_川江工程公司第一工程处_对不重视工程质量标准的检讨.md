Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editors:
    The People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Wang Xiyi on March 25 criticizing our division for being irresponsible in our engineering work. This criticism is correct.

    When our division undertook the basic construction project of Factory 103, many projects did not meet standards because the construction personnel did not seriously study engineering practices, and the leading cadres did not conduct strict inspections of the projects. When building the return water pool project for the electrolysis workshop last November, one beam in the electrolysis workshop sagged by 25 millimeters. Other problems, such as not thoroughly cleaning the stones used for pouring concrete and the screws on the roof frame being too long, all show that our division did not pay enough attention to engineering quality standards. We accept Comrade Wang Xiyi's criticism. In the future, we hope that the comrades of Factory 103 will give us more suggestions to help us improve our work.

### 川江工程公司第一工程处  对不重视工程质量标准的检讨

    对不重视工程质量标准的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报三月二十五日刊载了读者汪洗遗同志的来信，批评我处对工程不负责任，这个批评是正确的。
    我处承建一○三厂的基本建设工程时，因施工人员没有认真研究工程业务，领导干部也没有对工程进行严格检查，致使许多工程不合标准。去年十一月建造电解房回水池工程时，电解房有一根梁下垂达二十五公厘，其他如浇混凝土的石子没有彻底洗净，房架螺丝过长等毛病，都说明我处对工程质量标准太不重视。我们接受汪洗遗同志的批评。今后我们希望一○三厂的同志多多给我们提意见，以便帮助我们改进工作。
