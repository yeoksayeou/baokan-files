    How the Party Branch of the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region Led the Promotion of Advanced Typesetting Methods
    He Cun
    The advanced working method of typesetting worker Zhang Jiying is being promoted in the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region. This work is led by the factory's Communist Party branch and has already achieved great success. In the past, a trainee could only typeset over 800 characters per hour, but now they can typeset 2,500 characters. Workers unanimously acknowledge that Zhang Jiying's working method is scientific.

    (I)
    When Zhang Jiying's advanced typesetting method was disseminated to the typesetting workshop by the Party's propagandists, most of the workers did not believe that Zhang Jiying could pick 3,600 characters in an hour (note: Zhang Jiying's production record for this month is already 4,100 characters per hour). They said that if Zhang Jiying was a human and not a "god," then they would not believe it was true. Worker Yang Hai said, "I have never heard the myth of picking 3,600 characters. I have stared intently at the case to pick dots, and I only picked 3,200 characters in an hour. Our universal machine can only cast a maximum of 5,000 characters per hour. To pick 3,600 characters, unless a motor is installed on a person's body." Worker Su Zhixian believed that typesetting 3,600 characters per hour was baseless boasting. He said, "No matter how the case is modified, you still have to pick with your hands. A person can't grow four hands." Workers who usually liked to study technology carefully read the articles in the newspaper introducing Zhang Jiying's working method and felt it made sense; however, they were still skeptical about picking 3,600 characters per hour, believing it was very "mysterious." To eliminate these doubts, the Party branch used the deeds of Zhao Guoyou to publicize and explain to them. Although the workers did not say it to their faces, they secretly discussed, "Every profession is different, how many Zhao Guoyous are there in the whole country! Anyway, we haven't seen Zhang Jiying's operation with our own eyes."

    After the factory Party branch and the Party group of the typesetting section carefully studied the workers' ideological state, they believed that the primary problem was to overcome conservative thinking. Therefore, it was decided to adopt on-site education methods and use living examples to promote Zhang Jiying's advanced working method.

    Based on this decision, the Party branch mobilized several experienced technicians who loved to study technology, and Communist Party member Wang Huanzhang, to visit Zhang Jiying's type case in Kaifeng to learn Zhang Jiying's picking method. During the "May Day" holiday when Zhang Jiying came to Beijing to attend the celebrations, the Party branch invited Zhang Jiying to personally demonstrate in the typesetting section and report on the reasons why he could pick 3,600 characters per hour. The workers saw with their own eyes that Zhang Jiying typeset 1,200 characters in twenty minutes, and they heard Wang Huanzhang's visit report. The past views of "myth" and "boasting" were all dispelled.

    (II)
    After on-site education, the workers believed in Zhang Jiying's advanced working method; however, they still felt that the most basic characteristic of Zhang Jiying's method—reforming the old case—was not suitable for their factory's situation. Some workers said, "Although Zhang Jiying's eighteen-tray case is good, we can't use it. Zhang Jiying's trays are all theoretical words, and the words we use include theoretical, literary, and medical, which are all kinds of different categories. How can we imitate Zhang Jiying!" Some workers were afraid that they would not be familiar with the new type case for a while. In short, many people were unwilling to change the type case.

    To overcome the above conservative thinking, the Party branch decided to organize a force to conduct typical experiments, and after making achievements, then change the old type case. After joint research by the Party branch and the trade union, it was decided to form a Zhang Jiying advanced working method research group, led by Wang Huanzhang, Luo Jiashu, and Lin Jingxing, who had visited Kaifeng, and absorbing young workers, Communist Party member Song Zhenyuan, and two experienced workers who usually loved to study technology, to specialize in the experiment of changing the type case. At the beginning, the thinking of the research group was also chaotic: some were unwilling to let go of their own methods; some were afraid of failure and losing face; the leader of the research group was also uncertain, full of concerns, unwilling to lead, and requested to return to the workshop. At this time, Wang Huanzhang resolutely implemented the Party's instructions, repeatedly publicized the advantages of Zhang Jiying's type case, and fought against various incorrect thoughts. Under the specific leadership of the Party and the encouragement of Wang Huanzhang, the members' concerns were finally dispelled, and they overcame many difficulties in their actual work, completing the reform work of the first type case.

    The first type case was reformed and the work efficiency significantly improved. Technician Lin Jingxing used the usual picking method to pick only 2,300 characters per hour, while the trainee used the advanced picking method to pick 1,900 characters per hour. The comparison of these two examples educated all the workers in the workshop, and the general workers launched a fierce ideological struggle. Therefore, when the trade union convened all the workers in the workshop to discuss the use of the new type case, many workers examined their own conservative thinking. Worker Liu Yonghua said, "Communist Party member Song Zhenyuan is only a trainee of more than a year. As soon as he used the new case, he picked 1,900 characters. As soon as I saw it, I overturned all my old views. In the past, I always thought that there could be no creation or invention in this handicraft work; today I know that everything is different in the new society. In the future, I will definitely be determined to catch up." Worker Yan Jichang said, "The commonly used characters on the old case are far away, and the commonly used characters on the new case are together. Now, if you want to pick up words like 'one, two, three, four...' 'New Democracy,' you can pick them up as soon as you move. But if you use the old case, you have to run all over the case."

    (III)
    The success of the typical experiment powerfully persuaded some experienced technicians with conservative thinking. Therefore, when the new case was just reformed successfully, many workers envied Song Zhenyuan's achievement of picking 1,900 characters per hour on the new case. However, because they were accustomed to the old set of operating methods, they couldn't get rid of the old methods of more than ten years for a while. Facing the new case, their hands and brains were very uncoordinated, causing them to become dizzy and very nervous. Some people tried for a day and a half, and when they saw that the number of characters picked did not increase, they formed a big knot in their minds, and the more anxious they became, the more mistakes they made, and their mood relaxed. Many people said, "A manuscript is a sweat, and advanced methods are tiring." Some believe: "Concentration is also a characteristic, and it doesn't make much sense; who doesn't concentrate when working!" In order to change everyone's old habits and overcome the fear of fatigue and difficulties, the Party branch believed that it was necessary to cultivate new Zhang Jiyings, and then use the achievements of the new Zhang Jiyings to educate the masses and promote everyone to learn. Therefore, it was decided that Lu Guorui, a young member of the Communist Youth League who loved to study technology and had a higher political awareness, should first learn Zhang Jiying's operating methods on the new case in order; at the same time, the Zhang Jiying advanced working method research group in the workshop was expanded in order to widely discover talents and widely promote Zhang Jiying's working method. Lu Guorui accepted the task of the Party and studied Zhang Jiying's advanced working method day and night with young members of the Communist Youth League Xu Guilan, Liu Jian, and other young workers. Lu Guorui first picked words according to Zhang Jiying's spirit of concentration, and then learned Zhang Jiying's picking posture. At the beginning, he was very unaccustomed to it, "His hands and feet always didn't obey the command of his brain," and at night, his waist and legs ached, but he kept in mind the call of the Party branch, which added infinite strength. After a week of hard work, Lu Guorui's picking quantity soared, from the original 1,000 characters per hour to 2,500 characters, and other young members of the Communist Youth League and workers in the research group also made significant progress after learning Zhang Jiying's operating method. When the workers saw the blackboard newspaper praising young workers Song Zhenyuan, Lu Guorui, Li Shuhui, Xu Guilan, etc., for initially learning Zhang Jiying's advanced working method, everyone showed surprise and envy. Some people went to the workshop during their spare time to practice Zhang Jiying's working method in order to catch up.

    Summarizing the experience of promoting Zhang Jiying's advanced typesetting method, the most important point, as the factory Party committee said: promoting advanced working methods is a fierce struggle between new and old ideas, and it is a matter of the vast number of workers improving their ideological awareness and adopting new operating methods to improve technology. The Party branch must have firm confidence, fully mobilize the masses, and organize new forces in a timely manner, and use living facts to educate the masses. Only in this way can we overcome difficulties and guarantee the victorious promotion of advanced working methods.

    华北军区政治部印刷厂党支部是怎样领导推广先进排字法的
    禾村
    排字工人张继英的先进工作法，正在华北军区政治部印刷厂推广。这一工作是由该厂中共支部领导的，已经作出了很大的成绩。过去一个钟头只能排八百多字的学工，现在排两千五百字。工人们一致承认张继英的工作方法是科学的。
    （一）
    当张继英的先进排字工作法由党的宣传员传布到排字车间时，绝大部分工人不相信张继英会在一个钟头内拣到三千六百字（按：张继英本月份的生产纪录，一个钟头已能拣四千一百字）。他们说，张继英要是人而不是“神”的话，那我们不会相信这是真事。工人杨海说：“我从来没有听说拣到三千六百字的神话。我曾不转眼地盯着架子拣点子，一个钟头才拣到三千二百字。我们的万能机一个钟头最多也只能铸五千字。要拣到三千六百字，除非人身上安上马达。”工人苏致先认为一个钟头排三千六百字是没边没际的瞎吹。他说：“不管架子怎样改，总得用手拣。一个人总不能长出四只手。”平日爱钻研技术的工人仔细地看了报纸上介绍张继英工作法的文章，觉得很有道理；但对于每小时拣三千六百字还是半信半疑，认为这是很“玄乎”的事。为了消除这些怀疑，支部便拿赵国有的事迹，向他们进行宣传解释。工人们虽然当面不说，暗地里却纷纷议论：“隔行如隔山，全国有几个赵国有！反正我们没有亲眼看到过张继英的操作。”
    工厂党支部和排字股党的小组在认真地研究了工人的思想状况以后，认为首要的问题是克服保守思想。于是决定采用现场教育的方法，用活样子来宣传张继英的先进工作法。
    根据这个决定，支部动员了若干爱钻研技术的老技工，和共产党员王焕章一同去开封参观张继英的字架子，学习张继英的拣字法。“五一”节张继英来北京观礼时，支部又请张继英在排字股亲自作了表演，并报告了他每个钟头能拣三千六百字的原因。工人们亲眼看到张继英在二十分钟内排出一千二百字的底样，又听了王焕章的参观报告，过去的所谓“神话”“瞎吹”等看法都打消了。
    （二）
    经过现场教育，工人们对张继英的先进工作法相信了；但对张继英工作法的最基本的特点——改造旧架子，还觉得不适合自己厂子的情况。有的工人说：“张继英的十八盘架子虽好，就是咱们用不上。张继英的盘上都是理论方面的用字，咱们用的字，有理论方面的，有文艺方面的，又有医学方面的，真是五花八门，怎能仿效张继英的！”有的工人怕改了字架子一时不易熟习。总之，很多人不愿意改换字架子。
    为了克服以上的保守思想，支部决定组织力量，进行典型试验，在做出成绩之后，再改换旧的字架子。经过支部和工会的共同研究，决定以曾去开封参观的王焕章、骆家骕、林景星三人为主，吸收青年工人、共产党员宋振元和平日爱钻研技术的两个老工人组成张继英先进工作法研究小组，专作改换字架子的试验。开头，研究小组的思想也很混乱：有的不愿放下自己的一套；有的怕搞不成功，不光彩；研究组组长心中也没有谱，顾虑重重，不愿领导，要求回车间工作。这时，王焕章坚决执行了党的指示，反复地宣传张继英字架子的优点，和各种不正确的思想作了斗争。在党的具体领导和王焕章的鼓舞下，组员们的顾虑终于打消了，他们又在实际工作中克服了许多困难，完成了第一面字架子的改革工作。
    第一面字架子改换停当，工作效率显著提高。技工林景星用平日的拣字法，每小时只拣两千三百字，而学工用了先进拣字法每小时就拣一千九百字。这两个例子的对比，教育了全车间的工人，一般工人都展开了激烈的思想斗争。因此当工会召开全车间工人讨论使用新字架子时，许多工人都检讨了自己的保守思想。工人刘永华说：“共产党员宋振元，只是一年多的一个学工，一上新架子就拣到一千九百字。我一看，就把自己的老一套看法全部打翻了。过去总认为作这手工业活，不可能有什么创造发明；今天才知道新社会一切都不同。今后我一定下决心追上去。”工人阎继昌说：“旧架子上的常用字都离得很远，新架子上的常用字都在一块。现在要拿‘一、二、三、四……’‘新民主主义’等字，一动手就拿到了。但是，如果用的是旧架子，就得满架子跑。”
    （三）
    典型试验的成功，有力地说服了某些有保守思想的老技工。因此当新架子刚刚改换成功的时候，许多工人都羡慕宋振元在新架子上每小时拣一千九百字的成绩。但是由于他们习惯于旧的一套操作法，上了新架子，一时还丢不掉十多年来的旧作法。他们面对着新架子手脑十分不协调，以致弄得眼花撩乱，精神十分紧张。有的人试验了一天半晌，看看拣字的数量提不高，思想上就结了个大疙瘩，越着急越出岔子，心情也就松懈下去了。许多人说：“一篇稿子一身汗，先进方法累死人。”有的认为：“精神集中也算个特点，没有多大道理；谁干活精神不集中！”为了改变大家的旧习惯，克服怕累、怕困难的思想，支部认为必须培养新的张继英，然后拿新的张继英的成绩教育群众，推动大家进行学习。于是确定由爱钻研技术、政治觉悟较高的青年团员卢国瑞，先在新架子上按顺序地学习张继英的操作方法；同时扩大车间张继英先进工作法研究组，以便普遍发现人才，广泛地推广张继英工作法。卢国瑞接受了党的任务，不分日夜地和青年团员徐桂兰、刘俭以及其他青年工人学习张继英先进工作法。卢国瑞首先按照张继英的精神集中思想去拣字，接着就学习张继英的拣字姿势。开头，他很不习惯，“手脚老不服从脑子的指挥”，晚上，腰腿发痛，但是他牢记着党支部的号召，就平添了无限力量。经过一个星期的努力，卢国瑞的拣字数量飞跃上升，由原来每个钟头的一千字上升到两千五百字，其他几个青年团员和研究组的工人在学习张继英的操作方法以后，也都有显著的进步。当工人们看到黑板报上表扬青年工人宋振元、卢国瑞、李淑慧、徐桂兰等初步学会张继英先进工作法的报道时，每个人都露出惊讶和羡慕的神情。有的人为了迎头赶上，工余时间到工房去练习张继英工作法。
    总结推广张继英先进排字工作法的经验，最主要的一点，正如该厂党委所说：推广先进工作法，是一场激烈的新旧思想斗争，是广大工人提高思想觉悟和采用新的操作法来改进技术的问题。党的支部必须有坚定的信心，充分发动群众，及时组织新的力量，用活的事实来教育群众，只有这样，才能克服困难，保证先进工作法的胜利推广。
