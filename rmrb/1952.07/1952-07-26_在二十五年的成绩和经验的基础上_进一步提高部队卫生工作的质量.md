    On the Basis of Twenty-Five Years of Achievements and Experience
    Further Improve the Quality of Military Health Work
    Fu Lianzhang
    This year, August 1st marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Every soldier of the PLA feels infinite glory when reviewing the heroic struggle of the past twenty-five years; and seeing the motherland's independence threatened by aggressive war, they feel even more deeply the importance of their responsibility in defending the motherland and defending peace.
    Health workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also feel their glory and the great responsibility for the future. In the glorious history of the past twenty-five years, health workers have accumulated many valuable experiences, especially the experience of doing a good job and achieving victory in any difficult environment. How to rescue the wounded from the front lines in a timely manner, how not to lose a single wounded person during transportation and transfer, how to organize the masses to protect and rescue the wounded; how to carry out health work in the company, how to organize drug production, how to solve medical problems by using local materials, how to train health cadres according to actual needs, and how to maintain and improve the health level of all commanders and fighters required for combat missions, we have made creative achievements. Especially in the treatment of war wounds, there is a wealth of practical experience. We should sort out these experiences in order to continue to improve the quality of our work on the basis of these experiences.
    Chairman Mao once said: "The Chinese Communist Party, armed with the theories and ideology of Marxism, has generated a new style of work among the Chinese people, which is mainly the style of integrating theories with practice, the style of being closely linked with the masses of the people, and the style of self-criticism." ("On Coalition Government," Liberation Press Edition, p. 107) It is precisely because the health work of the People's Liberation Army has such a style that it can continue to develop and improve. Now that even greater tasks are before us, we should further promote this style and achieve new victories. Since the nationwide liberation, this style has been promoted to health departments across the country, so the health work has taken on a new look nationwide. In the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we have achieved many successes and accumulated experience in organizing health services for modern warfare, solving complex medical technology problems caused by modern warfare, and organizing and mobilizing a large reserve force. The vigorous development of the patriotic health campaign across the country is another powerful proof.
    The patriotic health campaign, which is currently being carried out universally and deeply, is something that can only appear among people who have already stood up. The patriotic health campaign has not only smashed the heinous bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism, but also greatly advanced China's health situation and achieved new results in health construction. This great victory on China's health front has profound and significant meaning. U.S. imperialists have combined all the evils of the past German and Japanese fascists and launched an unprecedented large-scale bacteriological warfare, attempting to gain experience from this heinous act in order to launch an even larger-scale massacre of peaceful people. But it has not been able to get its wish. Its heinous bacteriological warfare methods are being and will be completely bankrupt under the strike of our invincible health army. China's experience in anti-bacteriological warfare health work will be a major contribution to the peace-loving people of the world.
    Of course, in order to thoroughly defeat the enemy's barbaric aggressive actions and smash all the weapons of mass destruction that the enemy may use to kill human beings, we still need to make greater and more sustained efforts. Since 1950, the requirement of "improving quality" has been put forward in the health departments of the troops. Today, we should move toward this goal even more relentlessly. We are always a fighting force, and we are always accumulating strength to make our fighting force even stronger. Our military technology is constantly improving, and health and medical technology must also improve accordingly.
    From which aspects should we mainly improve? First, we must establish a sound health and medical system on the basis of the patriotic health campaign. For example, we must have a physical examination system so that we can regularly understand the health level of commanders and fighters, detect diseases at any time and treat them, and measure the effectiveness of our health care work from the understanding of the health level. We must have an applicable statistical reporting system so that our health situation can be accurately reflected and our work plan can have an accurate basis. We must have a health inspection system so that the health work we have established can be maintained regularly. We must have a health publicity and education system so that soldiers' health knowledge can be continuously improved and personal and environmental hygiene can be continuously improved. Often, the establishment of a system is not difficult, but the persistence of the system is very difficult, which requires our health workers to engage in this work with a serious and responsible spirit.
    Second, we must rectify our medical education to make it more in line with the requirements of regularization and military requirements. Medical education in our army has a long history. The continuous expansion of our army's health personnel and the continuous improvement of medical technology are inseparable from medical education that meets actual needs. In order to supply a large number of medical cadres, our medical education once adopted accelerated methods, which was very necessary at that time. However, in the future, under the principle of improving quality and improving technical level, our medical education must move to a new stage, to the direction of systematically teaching medical science. Only in this way can we train medical talents with the same level of knowledge under a unified education plan. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the military content of medical education and cultivate students' military habits from military life on campus. To do these things well, first of all, our cadres in charge of medical education must seriously summarize experience and seriously preside over the research and improvement of teaching methods.
    Third, we must strengthen the research work of health science. In the process of strengthening national defense construction, many new problems related to military health will be brought before us and need to be solved. If we ignore the research work of health science, we will suffer losses in ensuring the health of the troops. Our research work should first start with the most common problems in the troops, so the people who do research work must understand the actual life of the troops and maintain close contact with the troops. Generally speaking, our medical schools must have research work. Research work is inseparable from teaching work. With practical research work, there can be a constant source of teaching work, and students can constantly understand the connection between theory and practice.
    Establishing a sound health and medical system, rectifying medical education, and strengthening health science research are necessary steps to improve our health work standards. At present, a wave of cultural learning is being set off throughout the army. Health workers must also vigorously improve their basic knowledge of natural science so that they can improve their theoretical knowledge of medicine.
    In carrying out the regularization of our army's health work construction, the central issue is to sort out existing experience and absorb new knowledge, neither of which is dispensable. In terms of absorbing new knowledge, we must especially focus on learning Soviet medicine. In the past two or three years, we have made considerable progress in absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet health and medical system and health and medical technology; but we have not done enough in systematically introducing the new Soviet medical theories. For example, among our research workers and teaching staff, the study of Pavlov's theory has not been carried out in a planned way. We have translated some papers on Pavlov's theory, but they are limited to fragments and incomplete articles, and there has been no more comprehensive introduction and research. This certainly cannot be completed in a short period of time, but we must start from now on and engage in this work in a planned way. In the future, the publishing work of the health department must play a role in promoting this. In addition, we have also gained some gains in learning from the Soviet army's health services; but we have not universally established this kind of learning in schools and troops, which is what we should pay more attention to in the future.
    Finally, what we must emphasize is that improving the quality of our work is not limited to technical improvement. If we do not continue to improve politically, our technical improvement is not guaranteed. It is undeniable that the political atmosphere in our health department is not strong enough, and the political theoretical level of our health personnel is not high enough. Precisely because of this, narrow-minded conservative thinking and style still exist among some of our health personnel, which hinders the improvement of the health work level. We must emphasize the importance of studying politics, studying Marxism-Leninism, and studying Mao Zedong Thought. In medical schools, we must pay attention to systematically studying the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.
    As health fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we are fearless. We are not afraid of any difficulties in work, nor are we afraid of any difficulties in learning. Moving forward in a firm direction is our traditional style. In the face of even more important tasks, as long as we can maintain and carry forward this excellent tradition, we will surely achieve new achievements.

    在二十五年的成绩和经验的基础上
    进一步提高部队卫生工作的质量
    傅连暲
    今年八一是中国人民解放军建军二十五周年。每一个解放军的战士，回顾二十五年来英勇奋斗的历史，都感到无限的光荣；再看到祖国的独立受到侵略战争的威胁，更感到自己在保卫祖国保卫和平事业上责任的重大。
    中国人民解放军的卫生工作者同样感到自己的光荣和未来责任的重大。在二十五年的光荣历史中间，卫生工作者曾积累了许多宝贵的经验，特别是在任何困难环境都能做好工作取得胜利的经验。如何从火线上及时地抢救伤员，如何在运送转移中不丢掉一个伤员，如何组织群众掩护和救助伤员；如何进行连队卫生工作，如何组织药品生产，如何就地取材解决医疗问题，如何根据实际需要培养卫生干部，如何保持和提高战斗任务所需要的全体指战员的健康水平，我们都有创造性的成绩。特别在战伤治疗上，实际经验尤多。我们应该整理出这些经验，以便在这些经验的基础之上，继续提高我们的工作质量。
    毛主席曾经说过：“在马克思主义的理论思想武装之下的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要地就是理论与实际相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风与自我批评的作风。”（“论联合政府”解放社版第一○七页）解放军的卫生工作也正是由于具有这样的作风，才得不断发展，不断提高。现在，更重大的任务摆在我们的面前，我们应该更加发扬这样的作风，取得新的胜利。自全国解放以来，由于这样的作风已推行到全国卫生部门，所以在全国范围内，卫生工作也已经有了新的面貌。在抗美援朝斗争中，对于组织现代化战争的卫生勤务，解决现代化战争所引起的复杂的医疗技术问题和大量后备力量的组织动员等方面，我们都获得了许多成绩和经验。目前全国各地爱国卫生运动的蓬勃开展，又是一个有力的证明。
    目前正在普遍深入开展的爱国卫生运动，是唯有在已经站立起来的人民中间才会出现的。爱国卫生运动不仅粉碎了美帝国主义的万恶的细菌战，而且使我国的卫生情况大大地前进一步，在卫生建设上又获得新的成果。我国在卫生战线上这一巨大的胜利，其意义是深远而重大的。美帝国主义者集过去德日法西斯罪恶之大成，发动了空前大规模的细菌战，它想从这一次罪恶行动中，获得经验，以便发动更大规模的对和平人民的屠杀。但它并没有能够如愿以偿，它的万恶的细菌战方法，在我们的卫生大军无比力量的打击之下，正在和将要遭到完全的破产。我国反细菌战卫生工作的经验，对于全世界和平人民将是一个重大的贡献。
    当然，为了彻底地击溃敌人的野蛮侵略行动，粉碎敌人一切可能使用的大量残杀人类的武器，我们还需作更大更持久的努力。从一九五○年，在部队卫生部门中就已提出了“提高质量”的要求。今天，我们更应毫不松懈地朝着这个目标前进。我们永远是个战斗队，我们也永远在蓄积力量，使我们这一战斗队更加强大。我们的军事技术在不断提高，卫生医疗技术也必须随之提高。
    我们主要从那几个方面来提高呢？第一、我们要在爱国卫生运动的基础之上，建立起健全的卫生医疗制度。譬如，我们要有体格检查制度，使我们能够定期了解指战员的健康水平，发现病变随时治疗，并从健康水平的了解上来测量我们的保健工作的成效。我们要有适用的统计报告制度，使我们的卫生情况得到准确的反映，使我们的工作计划得到准确的根据。我们要有卫生检查制度，使我们已经建立起的卫生工作得以保持经常。我们要有卫生宣传教育制度，使战士们的卫生知识能够不断提高，个人卫生环境卫生能够不断改进。往往，制度的建立并不困难，但制度的坚持很不容易，这就需要我们的卫生工作者首先以认真负责的精神来从事这一工作。
    第二、我们要整顿我们的医学教育，使之更加符合于正规的要求和军事的要求。我军的医学教育已有长久的历史。我军卫生人员的不断扩充，医疗技术的不断改进，是与适合实际需要的医学教育分离不开的。为了大批地供应医务干部，我们的医学教育曾采取速成方式，这在当时是非常需要的。但今后，在提高质量提高技术水平的原则下，我们的医学教育必须走向新的阶段，走向有系统的讲授医学科学的方向。只有这样，才能在统一的教育计划之下，培养出程度相齐的医务人才。同时，还必须注意医学教育的军事内容，并从校内的军事生活中培养起学员的军人习惯。要把这些做好，首先我们的负责医学教育的干部必须认真总结经验，认真主持教学方法的研究和改进。
    第三、我们要加强卫生科学的研究工作。在加强国防建设的进程中，将有许多新的关系到部队卫生的问题提到我们面前，需要我们解决。如果我们忽略了卫生科学研究工作，我们就会在保障部队的健康上遭到损失。我们的研究工作，首先应从部队中最普遍存在着的问题着手，因而做研究工作的人必须了解部队的实际生活，与部队保持密切的联系。一般地说，我们的医学校都必须有研究工作。研究工作与教学工作是分不开的。有了切合实际的研究工作，在教学工作上才能有不断的泉源，才能使学员不断地领会到理论与实际的联系。
    健全卫生医疗制度，整顿医学教育，加强卫生科学研究工作，这是提高我们的卫生工作水准所必需的步骤。目前，全军正在掀起文化学习的热潮。卫生工作者也必须大力提高自然科学的基本知识，这样才能提高医学的理论知识。
    在进行我军正规化卫生工作建设时，其中心问题在于整理已有的经验，吸收新的知识，两者不可缺一。在吸收新的知识方面，尤须着重学习苏联医学。两三年来，我们在吸收苏联卫生医疗制度和卫生医疗技术方面的先进经验，是有相当成绩的；但在有系统地介绍苏联新的医学理论方面，还做得很不够。譬如，在我们的研究工作人员、教学工作人员中间，对于巴甫洛夫学说的学习还没有有计划地来做。我们曾经翻译了一些关于巴甫洛夫学说的论文，但仅限于断笺零篇，比较全面的介绍和研究还没有。这当然不是短时期所能完成的，但我们必须从现在开始，有计划地从事这一工作。今后卫生部门的出版工作，尤须在这一方面起推动的作用。另外，关于学习苏联的军队卫生勤务，我们也曾有一些收获；但是我们还没有在学校和部队中间普遍建立这种学习，这是我们今后更应注意的事情。
    最后，我们还必须着重提出的是：提高我们的工作质量，并不仅限于在技术上的提高。如果我们不在政治上继续提高，我们的技术提高是没有保障的。不容否认，我们卫生部门的政治空气还不够浓厚，我们卫生人员的政治理论水平也还不够高。正是因为这样，在我们有些卫生人员中间，还存在着狭隘的保守的思想与作风，这对于卫生工作水平的提高是有妨碍的。我们必须强调学习政治、学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东思想的重要性。在医学校里，尤须注意有系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基础知识。
    做为中国人民解放军的卫生战士，我们是无所畏惧的。不怕工作中的任何困难，也不怕学习中的任何困难，向着一个坚定的方向前进，这就是我们的传统作风。在更加重大的任务前面，只要我们能够保持和发扬这种优良的传统，我们一定会获得新的成就。
