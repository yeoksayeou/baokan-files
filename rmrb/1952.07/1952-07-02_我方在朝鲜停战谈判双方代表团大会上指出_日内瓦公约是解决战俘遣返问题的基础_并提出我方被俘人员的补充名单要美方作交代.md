Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 1st: At the meeting of both delegation representatives at the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 1st, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out in his speech: At present, the only obstacle to the Korean armistice is the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. According to the universally recognized provisions of the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, this issue should have been easily resolved. However, the other side has taken a series of provocative actions inside and outside the meeting, making the resolution of this issue increasingly difficult. The other side must bear the responsibility for all the consequences. General Nam Il pointed out that the focus of the current dispute over the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is: whether to abide by or violate the 1949 Geneva Convention. Our side firmly believes that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention in order to realize the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world.

General Nam Il sent a letter to the other side's chief representative, Major General Harrison, on the 1st, submitting a list of 203 of our captured personnel, requesting the other side to account for their whereabouts. The letter is as follows:

"To Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

(1) Enclosed is a supplementary list of 203 people. According to the proof shown on the list for each name, these people have been captured by your army and held as prisoners of war. Our side requests your side to account for these 203 of our captured personnel.

(2) On March 11th and April 4th, 1952, our side submitted a list of a total of 1,014 people to your side based on the materials you provided regarding our captured personnel, requesting your side to account for the whereabouts of these our captured personnel. Your side agreed to account for them. Although our side sent another letter on June 5th urging your side to account for them, your side has not yet done so. I now request you again to account for them without further delay.

Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation, July 1st, 1952"

At the same time, General Nam Il replied to Major General Harrison's letter regarding the issue of prisoner of war camp markings, and once again pointed out that our prisoner of war camps all have clear markings in accordance with the agreement between the two sides regarding prisoner of war camp markings. The full text of the reply is as follows:

"To Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

(1) Your letters of June 18th, 25th, and 28th, 1952, have been received. Regarding the matter that our prisoner of war camps (including the Second, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth prisoner of war camps) all have clear markings in accordance with the agreement between the two sides regarding prisoner of war camp markings, I have given a clear answer in my letter of June 17th, 1952. I now affirm this again.

(2) Your side, disregarding the facts, has repeatedly raised the so-called issue of the location and markings of our prisoner of war camps, obviously seeking excuses to create new incidents. It must be pointed out that your side has not yet given any explanation for the five incidents of bombing and strafing our Changsong No. 1 prisoner of war camp and Jiangdong No. 8 prisoner of war camp, in which your captured personnel were held. Your side cannot evade responsibility for the serious consequences caused by any indiscriminate bombing and strafing that violates international law and humanitarian principles.

Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation
July 1st, 1952"

    我方在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上指出
    日内瓦公约是解决战俘遣返问题的基础
    并提出我方被俘人员的补充名单要美方作交代
    【新华社开城一日电】一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军在发言中指出：目前阻碍着朝鲜停战的只有一个战俘遣返问题。这一问题根据着举世公认的日内瓦战俘公约的规定，本来应该很容易地获得解决。但对方在会内会外采取了一系列的挑衅行为，使这一问题的解决变得日益困难，对方必须担负一切后果的责任。南日将军指出目前战俘遣返问题争执的中心是：遵守还是破坏一九四九年日内瓦公约。我方坚决认为战俘遣返问题必须根据日内瓦公约的原则求得解决，来实现世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战。
    南日将军在一日致函对方首席代表哈利逊少将，提交一份二百零三名我方被俘人员的名单，要求对方交代他们的下落，信文如下：
    “联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    （一）兹将一份二百零三人的补充名单随函提交你方。依照各个人名在名单上所示的证明，这些人已为你军所俘，并收容作为战俘。我方要求你方对这些二百零三名我方被俘人员作交代。
    （二）我方曾于一九五二年三月十一日与四月四日根据你方交来的关于我方被俘人员的材料，向你方提出了共计一千零十四人的名单，要求你方交代这些我方被俘人员的下落。你方曾允许作交代。虽然我方又于六月五日函催你方交代，你方至今仍未作交代。我现在再次要求你方交代，不再迟延。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军一九五二年七月一日”
    南日将军同时答复了哈利逊少将关于战俘营标识问题的来信，再次指出我方各战俘营都按照双方关于战俘营标识的协议，设有清晰的标识。复信全文如下：“联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    （一）一九五二年六月十八日、二十五日及二十八日你的来信业已收到。关于我方各战俘营（包括第二、第六、第九及第十号战俘营）均按照双方关于战俘营标识的协议设有清晰的标识一事，我在一九五二年六月十七日信中已予明白的答复。现在我再次予以肯定。
    （二）你方不顾事实，一再提出所谓我方战俘营的位置与标识问题，显系为制造新的事件找寻藉口。必须指出：你方对于五次轰炸与扫射我方昌城第一号战俘营与江东第八号战俘营中的你方被俘人员事件，迄今尚未作任何交代。对任何违反国际法与人道原则的狂轰滥炸所造成的严重后果，你方决不能推卸责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年七月一日”
