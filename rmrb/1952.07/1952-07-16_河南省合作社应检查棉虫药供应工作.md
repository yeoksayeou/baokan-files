    Henan Province Cooperatives Should Inspect the Supply of Cotton Insecticides

    Comrade Editor: After receiving the "Joint Directive on Purchasing and Preparing Cotton Insecticides" from the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the National Cooperative Federation, and the People's Bank of China on May 28th, the Henan Province Cooperatives did not contact the Department of Agriculture and Forestry or other relevant departments, nor did they conduct thorough investigations, research, and planning in advance. Instead, they subjectively allocated the additional loans from the higher authorities to the cooperatives in various special districts, which failed to effectively utilize the loans and resulted in waste. For example, tobacco is an effective raw material for cotton insecticides and is very popular among cotton farmers. The province happens to have a large stock of unsold "substandard tobacco" (estimated at 30 million jin). If this "substandard tobacco" were used to control cotton insects, it would play a significant role. However, they did not consider utilizing this "substandard tobacco" but instead went to other places to buy cotton oil soap. The Luoyang Special District Cooperative sent people to Beijing to order 550,000 jin of cotton oil soap, and the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative also sent people to Beijing to order 300,000 jin. The provincial cooperative not only did not pay attention to this chaotic situation but also excused themselves by saying "the Three-Anti Campaign is currently finalizing its conclusions, and there is really no time." But in reality, they were worried about accumulating capital and paying interest, so they irresponsibly allocated the loans to the cooperatives in various special districts. We believe that this is entirely the result of a bureaucratic work style, and the Henan Province Cooperatives must conduct a deep self-criticism of this matter and quickly correct it.

### 河南省合作社应检查棉虫药供应工作

    河南省合作社应检查棉虫药供应工作
    编辑同志：河南省合作社在五月二十八日接到中央农业部、全国合作总社和中国人民银行“关于购备防治棉虫药剂的联合指示”以后，不和农林厅以及其他有关部门联系，也不事前作周密的调查研究和计划，就主观地把上级增拨的贷款分配到各专区合作社，以致不能很好地发挥贷款的作用，形成了浪费。例如烟草是除治棉虫有效而且很受棉农欢迎的一种棉虫药的原料，该省恰好存有很多滞销的
    “等外烟”（据估计有三千万斤），这些“等外烟”如果用于除治棉虫，将会发挥很大的作用。但他们却不考虑利用这些“等外烟”，而舍近求远去别的地方买棉油皂。该省洛阳专区合作社即派人到北京订购了五十五万斤棉油皂，郑州专区合作社也派人到北京订购了三十万斤。对这混乱现象，省社不但不给以重视，反而推说“三反学习正在定案总结，实在没有空”，但实际上是因为在他们思想上有怕积压资金背利息的顾虑，所以就不负责任地把贷款分配给各专区合作社。我们认为这完全是官僚主义工作作风所造成的结果，河南省合作社必须对这件事进行深刻检讨并迅速纠正。
