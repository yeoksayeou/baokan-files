    Resolutely Stop the U.S. Provocations to Expand the War

    From the recent series of facts—U.S. planes indiscriminately bombing peaceful people and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, and constantly violating our Northeast airspace, directly provoking the people of our country—it is not difficult for people to see that the U.S. aggressors are still continuing to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations, attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea. Peace-loving people all over the world must become more active to stop all these provocative actions by the United States to expand the war of aggression.

    Although the U.S. government is full of talk about "peace" and "humanity," the high-ranking officers of the U.S. invading army have constantly confessed their evil intentions and heinous crimes of destroying peace and violating humanity. According to a letter from Scheffler, head of the Belgian mission in Tokyo, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, Van Fleet, told him "privately" that "the U.S. government is delaying the armistice negotiations in order to buy time to create a 'situation full of strength' and insist on their demand for 'voluntary' repatriation of prisoners of war"; and that the United States is now attempting to "gain military advantage" on the Korean front in order to "create some conditions" to "obtain the greatest freedom of action in Korea and Asia." At the same time, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins and the Chief of Naval Operations Fechteler, who are "inspecting" in Korea and Japan, are also making wild remarks there, touting their so-called "military pressure." A Washington dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 17th confirmed that Collins had clamored "to bomb North Korea with all its strength" and "to use atomic bombs." Reuters and Associated Press dispatches from Tokyo on the 17th both admitted that Fechteler had told reporters that Clark "has the right to order the Allied forces to bomb Manchuria," "has the right to order the Allied forces navy to attack Manchuria," "land in North Korea," and "blockade the Chinese coast," and so on. These arrogant shouts of a group of American war-mongers once again fully prove the United States' determination to disregard the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world and attempt to continue to expand the war of aggression against Korea.

    This exposure of the U.S. conspiracy, like the previous exposure of the crimes of the U.S. side in torturing and killing prisoners of war by Dodd and Colson, will obviously throw the U.S. government into a panic. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 17th has already scolded Reuters, saying that the talk about Fechteler made by its reporter was "nonsense" and "fabricated out of thin air"; however, the Associated Press should not have forgotten that the United Press dispatch issued on the same day as Reuters also said the same thing. This cannot be denied no matter how one argues.

    The provocative actions and calls for expanding the war by the U.S. aggressors have long been known and seen by the world, and such provocations and calls are by no means enough to frighten the heroic Korean and Chinese people. In the face of the powerful strength of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, all the previous provocations and attacks by the U.S. aggressors have been defeated, and they have had to sit down for armistice negotiations; now, the Korean and Chinese People's forces have become even stronger, and if the U.S. dares to expand the war, it will definitely be smashed. The Chinese people are strengthening their work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and continue to support the Chinese and Korean People's forces. We must unite with the peace-loving people all over the world, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our struggle, and resolutely stop all provocative actions by the U.S. aggressors to expand the war.

### 坚决制止美国扩大战争的挑衅行动

    坚决制止美国扩大战争的挑衅行动
    从最近美国飞机对朝鲜后方和平人民、和平设施滥施轰炸，并不断侵犯我国东北领空，直接向我国人民进行挑衅的一连串事实中，人们不难看出：美国侵略者仍在继续拖延与破坏停战谈判，企图扩大侵朝战争。全世界爱好和平的人民，必须更加积极起来，制止美国企图扩大侵略战争的这一切挑衅行动。
    美国政府尽管满口说的是“和平”“人道”，然而，美国侵略军的高级军官却不断地招供了他们破坏和平、违反人道的罪恶用心和滔天罪行。据比利时驻东京使团团长薛佛勒里的信件透露，侵朝的美国第八军军长范佛里特“私下”告诉他：“美国政府正在拖延停战谈判，以便争取时间来造成一个‘充满力量的形势’，坚持他们的‘自愿’遣返战俘的要求”；并且现在美国正企图在朝鲜前线“获得军事优势”，以便“创造一些条件”，“在朝鲜和亚洲得到最大的行动自由”。与此同时，正在朝鲜和日本进行“视察”的美国陆军参谋长柯林斯和海军作战部长费泰勒，也在那里大放厥词，吹嘘他们的所谓“军事压力”。法新社华盛顿十七日的电讯证实，柯林斯曾叫嚣“要全力轰炸北朝鲜”、“要使用原子弹”。路透社及合众社于十七日同时从东京发出的电讯中，都承认费泰勒曾向记者宣称，克拉克“有权命令联军轰炸满洲”、“有权命令联军海军进攻满洲”、“在北朝鲜登陆”、“封锁中国海岸”等等。这一批美国战争贩子们的狂妄叫嚣，又一次充分证明美国决心不顾全世界人民的和平愿望，企图继续扩大侵朝战争的严重阴谋。
    对于美国阴谋的这一个暴露，和以前杜德、柯尔生关于美方虐杀战俘罪行的暴露一样，显然会使美国政府陷于慌乱。美联社东京十七日电讯中已经破口大骂了路透社，说它的记者所发的关于费泰勒的谈话是“胡诌”和“凭空捏造”；然而，美联社却不该忘了和路透社同一天发出的合众社的电讯也是那么说的。这是无论如何狡辩不了的。
    美国侵略者的挑衅行动和扩大战争的叫嚣，早已为世人所共知共见了，而这种挑衅和叫嚣决不足以吓诈英勇的朝中人民。在朝中人民部队的强大力量面前，美国侵略者过去的一切挑衅和进攻都被打败了，不得不坐下来进行停战谈判；现在，朝中人民部队已经更加强大，美国方面如敢扩大战争，就一定会被碰得头破血流。中国人民正在加强抗美援朝的工作，继续支援中朝人民部队。我们一定要和全世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起，提高警惕，加强斗争，坚决制止美国侵略者扩大战争的一切挑衅行动。
