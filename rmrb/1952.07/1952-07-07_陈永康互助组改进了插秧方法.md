The Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team in Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu, completed rice transplanting work on June 6th, ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years. Last year, Chen Yongkang only started transplanting rice seedlings two days before the Grain in Ear period, but this year, all the team's rice fields were completely transplanted by the Grain in Ear. The first batch of rice seedlings planted in the high-yield fields are now neatly aligned row by row, already over a foot tall. When transplanted, each rice seedling only had six or seven tillers, but now it has divided into more than a dozen. From a distance, the seedlings of the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team have grown so close together that the intervals between plants have almost disappeared. The leaves are lush and strong, with a slightly blackish green color.

This year, all the rice paddies of the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team adopted new transplanting methods. They divided the team's 56 mu of rice competition fields into four grades—excellent, upper, middle, and lower—based on soil quality and historical yield levels; then, they determined the transplanting density according to the amount of fertilizer applied by each household. It is said that there is an old custom in the vast rice-growing areas of Jiangnan: regardless of whether the land is good or bad, six seedlings must be planted in each row (in one hand). Farmers have very strong conservative ideas in this regard. Even now, many farmers still say, "If you don't plant six seedlings, the ghosts will be upset, people in the family will die, and the rice will not be harvested." This hinders the improvement of transplanting methods. In previous years, although Chen Yongkang adopted the method of small-clump square close planting, he still planted six seedlings per row. This year, in order to strive for higher yields, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team boldly broke the centuries-old custom of planting six seedlings per row based on past experience. They planted the 3.5 mu of excellent-grade fields with a spacing of 9 inches, the 20 mu of upper-grade fields with a spacing of 8 inches, the 20.2 mu of middle-grade fields with a spacing of 7 inches, and the lower-grade fields, except for 2.5 mu planted with a spacing of 6 inches, were all planted in rectangles with a plant spacing of 6 inches and a row spacing of 7 inches. Not only was the seedling density different in each plot of land, but also the transplanting methods used in the same plot were different according to the different environment. The Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team also conducted several experiments. A portion of the upper-grade fields were tested with the method of early transplanting, extending the rice growth and maturity period, and applying more fertilizer, in order to strive for higher yields.

This year, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team brought into play the collective strength, overcame difficulties, and improved cultivation techniques. Under Chen Yongkang's influence, all the farmers in the team were willing to use their brains more and constantly improve their techniques. They could only guarantee the conducting of experiments after the establishment of the mutual aid team. If it were just one household, it would be impossible to carry out various experiments. The advantage of the mutual aid team is even more obvious in its ability to help everyone overcome difficulties. Here is just one example: On May 31st, Chen Yongkang worked in the rain for most of the day in order to complete the plan, caught a cold, and fell ill. According to the plan, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team was supposed to finish transplanting rice seedlings by June 6th. Chen Yongkang's illness affected the transplanting plan. However, they overcame the difficulties and held a group meeting that evening, deciding to break the local custom of not transplanting rice seedlings before breakfast starting the next day, so that they finally victoriously completed the transplanting work of all the rice fields on June 6th (Grain in Ear).

The soaring patriotic labor enthusiasm of the team members was unprecedented in previous years. Take transplanting rice seedlings as an example, this is the most strenuous work in rice cultivation. But this year, when transplanting rice seedlings, the male and female team members did not feel that transplanting was very hard. When they felt sore in their backs, they sat down to drink a few sips of tea, and then went back to transplanting rice seedlings. Their faces, tanned black by the sun, revealed smiles. They said: If we had operated this way alone last year, we would have rested long ago. This year, everyone is organized to work together, and we have also launched a patriotic production increase competition with the whole country, and fatigue does not know where to go.

The visits and learning from many places have also greatly encouraged them. When the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team was transplanting rice seedlings, the county and district leaders of Songjiang County organized farmers from various districts to come to the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team to learn and promote Chen Yongkang's transplanting experience. People from nearby counties and the suburbs of Shanghai also rushed to visit after learning the good news of Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team's transplanting. On May 29th, the most people came to visit. On that day, the radio broadcast pleasant and melodious songs, Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team's transplanting experience was written on blackboards, and people were coming and going everywhere on the ridges, in the seedling fields, and on the threshing floor. Comrades from the Beijing Film Studio's film crew also came to shoot a movie that day. Just as the masses said, it was as lively as a wedding.

Currently, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team is actively carrying out seedling inspection, seedling protection, and seedling replanting work. They have formulated specific measures for managing rice seedlings from after transplanting to before the first weeding, to ensure the healthy development and growth of all seedlings. At the same time, they are summarizing the production work of the first half of the year, rectifying the mutual aid team, and preparing for the next stage of the battle. In the future, they will focus on accumulating fertilizer, weeding, fighting drought, and eliminating pests, striving for a bumper harvest in all rice fields this year.

### 陈永康互助组改进了插秧方法

    陈永康互助组改进了插秧方法
    六月六日，苏南松江县陈永康互助组完成稻田插秧工作，比往年提前了十天到半个月时间。陈永康去年在芒种前两天才开始插秧，而今年在芒种时，全组稻田的秧已经全部插完。第一批插的丰产田里的稻秧，现在一行一行，齐齐整整，已经长了一尺多高。插秧时一棵稻秧只有六、七枝秧叶，现在已分到十几枝。远远看去，陈永康互助组的秧苗，棵与棵的间隔已长得靠在一起了。叶子又肥又壮，绿里有些发黑。
    今年，陈永康互助组各户所有的稻田，都采用了新的插秧方法。他们把全组五十六亩水稻竞赛田，根据土质好坏和历年产量高低，分成优、上、中、下四等；再按各户施肥量的多少，决定插秧的密度。据说江南广大水稻区有个老习惯，不管地好地坏，一定要每列（一顺手）插六棵秧。农民在这方面有很浓厚的保守思想。直到现在，还有很多农民说：“不种六棵头，鬼要作怪的，家里要死人的，谷子要不收的”。这样就妨碍了插秧方法的改进。往年，陈永康虽然采用小株方形密植法，但每列仍是插六棵。今年，陈永康互助组为了争取更高产量，根据历年经验，大胆地打破了千百年来每列插六棵秧的老习惯。他们把三点五亩的优等田插九寸见方，二十亩上等田插八寸见方，二十点二亩中等田插七寸见方，下等田除二点五亩插六寸见方外，其余都插成了株距六寸，行距七寸的长方形。不但各块地里的秧苗密度不同，而且在同一块地里所用的插秧方法，也按不同的环境而有所不同。陈永康互助组还进行了几种实验。一部分上等田试用提早插秧、延长水稻生长成熟期和多施肥料的方法，以争取更高产量。
    今年陈永康互助组发挥了集体力量，克服了困难，提高了耕作技术。全组农民在陈永康的影响下，都愿意多动脑筋，不断改进技术。他们进行实验，只是在成立互助组以后才有了保证。如果只是一户人家，是无法进行各种实验的。互助组能够帮助大家克服困难，这种优点更是明显。这里只举一个例子：陈永康在五月三十一日那天，为了完成计划，在雨天工作了大半天，受了风寒，病倒了。按照计划，陈永康互助组要在六月六日插完稻秧。陈永康一病，影响了插秧计划。但是他们克服了困难，当晚就召开小组会，决定从第二天起，打破当地在早饭前不插秧的习惯，这样，终于在六月六日
    （芒种）胜利地完成了全部稻田的插秧工作。
    组员们爱国劳动热情的高涨，是往年所没有的。拿插秧来说，这是种植水稻劳作中最吃力的工作。但今年插秧时，男女组员们并不觉得插秧很苦。他们感觉腰酸了，就坐下来喝几口茶，然后又去插秧。他们被日光晒得乌黑的脸上，露着微笑。他们说：要是去年单个儿这样操作，早休息了。今年大家组织起来一块做活，而且还向全国发起了爱国增产竞赛，疲劳也不知道到那儿去了。
    各地许多人来参观、学习，也对他们有很大鼓舞。陈永康互助组插秧的时候，松江县的县、区领导方面，组织各区农民到陈永康互助组来学习，推广陈永康的插秧经验。附近各县和上海市郊的人们，知道陈永康互助组插秧的喜讯，也纷纷自动前往参观。五月二十九日，前来参观的人最多。那日，收音机播送着愉快悦耳的歌声，一块块黑板报上写着陈永康互助组的插秧经验，田埂上、秧田旁、场地上，到处来往着参观的人们。北京电影制片厂的摄影队同志也在这天来拍摄电影。正像群众所说的，这和做喜事一样的热闹。
    目前陈永康互助组正积极进行查苗、保苗、补苗工作。他们订出了插秧以后到第一次趟稻除草前管理秧苗的具体办法，保证全部秧苗健康地发育成长。同时，他们正在对上半年的生产工作进行总结，整顿互助组，迎接下一阶段的战斗。今后，他们将抓紧进行积肥、除草、抗旱、除虫等工作，争取今年全部稻田丰收。
