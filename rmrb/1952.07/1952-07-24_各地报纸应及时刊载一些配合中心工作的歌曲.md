    Local Newspapers Should Promptly Publish Songs that Support Central Work
    Comrade Editor: I am a primary school teacher in the countryside. In addition to teaching, we also help with propaganda work every day. Since the start of the drought resistance work this spring, we have used songs to conduct propaganda among the masses, which has been enthusiastically welcomed and has had a significant impact. However, judging from various local newspapers, there are very few songs published in a timely manner that support the central work, which cannot meet the needs of our propaganda work. Therefore, I suggest that local newspapers should promptly publish songs that support the central work and are popular among farmers in the future, so that the vast number of teachers and students can use these songs to further play a role in propaganda and mobilization in the patriotic production increase campaign.

    各地报纸应及时刊载一些配合中心工作的歌曲
    编辑同志：我是农村的一位小学教师。我们每天除了教课外，还要帮助进行宣传工作。自今春进行抗旱工作以来，我们曾利用歌曲，在群众中进行了宣传，并受到群众的热烈欢迎，因而宣传效果也很大。但从各地报纸看，及时刊登这样配合中心工作的歌曲还很少，不能够满足我们宣传工作上的需要。因此，我建议各地方报纸，今后应及时刊载一些配合中心工作的、为农民喜闻乐见的歌曲，使广大教师和学生能利用这些歌曲在爱国增产竞赛运动中，更发挥宣传鼓动的作用。    悲鸿
