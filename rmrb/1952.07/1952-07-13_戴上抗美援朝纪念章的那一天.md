    The morning of June 1st, a long-awaited piece of good news came from the telephone to the Fifth Company of a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army's motor transport unit: "The Resist America, Aid Korea commemorative medal, a gift from the people of the motherland, has arrived!" When the instructor came back from the regimental headquarters with a heavy red package on his back, everyone rushed forward to greet him, surrounding him tightly. The instructor pointed to the commemorative medal on his chest and said to everyone: "Look! This is what we have been looking forward to ever since we crossed the Yalu River." Hundreds of eyes were immediately fixed on the shiny, gold medal engraved with Chairman Mao's image, and many people were even moved to tears. Zhang Yongduo, a driver known as the "Flying Driver," squeezed into the crowd and held up a commemorative medal, shouting: "This is the heart of the motherland's people loving us, the heart of the world's people loving us!" Everyone danced and cheered along with him.

    That day, this motor transport company solemnly held a medal presentation ceremony. The company commander and instructor first awarded the commemorative medals to more than forty model workers and meritorious individuals, and then every soldier was also adorned with a commemorative medal on their chest. The lofty honor inspired the heroic drivers, and they solemnly swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: We will resolutely fight to the end to defend the motherland and the cause of defending peace; we will create new records in transportation work to thank the people of the motherland!

    This was a battle night on the transportation line. Dozens of transport trucks raced to the grain station. People were working hard under the slogan "Load quickly, carry quickly!" The drivers also took the initiative to participate in the loading and unloading work, carrying hundred-pound sacks of grain and running. The efficiency of loading broke the usual record. In less than three minutes, dozens of trucks were loaded with grain and headed to the front line with horns blaring.

    The truck body was speeding along the road, and the commemorative medal was shining in the dim light of the cab. When the driver and assistant made eye contact, they smiled at each other. They had gone through so many days and nights of battle, overcome so many hardships, to gloriously receive this commemorative medal! They bravely rushed through the lighting area, removed time bombs, cleared triangular nails, and, braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, successfully transported large quantities of military supplies to the front lines. Communist Party member Zhao Wenbin looked at the bullet marks on the truck left by enemy aircraft strafing and thought of Zhang Haiqing, a model youth league member who had gloriously sacrificed himself. He said to his assistant, Liu Zhenjie: "Old Liu, this commemorative medal is forged with the lives, blood, sweat, and victories of our comrades. We must maintain and carry forward this glory, or else how can we be worthy of the martyrs!"

    In the summer night, the truck cab was particularly stuffy. The drivers took off their shirts, bare-chested, driving the trucks quickly and skillfully. Suddenly, anti-aircraft gunfire rang out on the hillside. All the truck lights were immediately turned off. The trucks continued to drive forward in the darkness. Enemy planes swooped down on the convoy with a sharp whistling sound. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Guoqiang was the first to hear the whistling sound of the bombs falling. He immediately shouted: "Drive forward quickly!" Flying Driver Zhang Yongduo quickly drove the truck forward. Four bombs exploded between him and the truck behind him, and thick smoke and dust rushed onto the truck, but no truck was hit. The trucks continued to move forward at an even faster speed, quickly transporting the grain to the front-line grain station.

    When the trucks returned from the front line, the heroic drivers greeted the dawn and sang happily: "The wheels are flying, flying quickly, the lights are flashing, flashing quickly, flashing across so many rivers, and flying across so many mountains, carrying the motherland's supplies to the front line all night long. Look how glorious we are, the commemorative medal on our chest shines with golden light. We are advancing forever along the road to victory!"

    戴上抗美援朝纪念章的那一天
    新华社记者  庆肇
    六月一日清晨，一个久盼的喜讯从电话里传到了志愿军汽车运输部队某团第五连：“祖国人民赠送的抗美援朝纪念章来到了！”当指导员背着一个沉甸甸的红包袱从团部回来时，大伙儿就一个冲锋迎上去，把他紧紧地包围住了。指导员向大家指着自己胸前的纪念章说：“看啊！这就是咱们从跨过鸭绿江那天起一直盼望着的东西。”几百只眼睛马上都盯在那枚金光闪耀，镌着毛主席像的纪念章上，有许多人甚至激动得流出眼泪来。被誉为“飞车手”的司机张永铎用力地挤到人丛中，高举着一枚纪念章叫道：“这是祖国人民热爱我们的心呀，是全世界人民热爱我们的心呀！”大伙儿手舞足蹈地跟着欢呼起来。
    当天，这个汽车运输连隆重地举行了授章大会。连长、指导员首先把纪念章授予四十多位模范和功臣，随后每一个战士的胸前也都佩上了纪念章。崇高的荣誉鼓舞着英勇的司机们，他们在毛主席像前庄严地宣誓：坚决为保卫祖国和保卫和平的事业而战斗到底；要创造运输工作上的新纪录来答谢祖国人民！
    这是一个运输线上的战斗之夜。几十辆运输汽车驰到了粮站。人们都在“快扛快装！”的口号下奋力工作，司机们也纷纷自动地参加装卸工作，大家扛着百斤重的粮袋奔跑着。装车的效率打破了往常的纪录，不到三分钟，几十辆大汽车都载满了粮食，响着喇叭向前线驰去。
    车身在公路上飞跑着，纪念章在驾驶室暗暗的灯光中闪烁着，司机和助手们眼光一接触，就不约而同地微微一笑。他们经过了多少日日夜夜的战斗，克服了多少艰苦困难，才光荣地得到这枚纪念章呵！他们英勇地冲过照明区，搬走定时炸弹，扫除三角钉，冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，胜利地将大批大批的军用物资运输到前线。共产党员赵文斌看着车上被敌机扫射过的弹痕，想起已经光荣牺牲的模范青年团员张海庆。他向助手刘振杰说：“老刘，这纪念章是我们战友们的生命、血汗和胜利铸成的，我们要好好地保持和发扬这一光荣，不然怎对得起先烈们！”
    夏夜，汽车驾驶室里格外闷热。司机们脱了上衣，光着膀子，紧张而机灵地驾驶着车子飞跑。突然，山岗上响起了防空枪声。所有的汽车灯光便立即熄灭了。车子在黑暗中继续向前开着。敌机带着尖锐的啸音向这一车群俯冲下来。副排长刘国强首先听到了炸弹下来的啸声，他立即喊道：“快向前开！”飞车手张永铎迅速把车向前开去，四颗炸弹正在他和后面的一辆汽车之间爆炸，浓烟尘土向车上扑来，但是一辆汽车也没有被炸中。车子又以更快的速度继续前进，很快地把粮食运到了前线的粮站。
    当汽车从前线驰回的时候，英勇的司机们迎着晨曦欢快地高唱着：“车轮子飞呀，快快地飞，灯光闪呀，快快地闪，闪过多少河呀，又飞过多少山，载着祖国的物资连夜奔向前。你看我们多荣耀，纪念章在胸前闪金光。我们沿着胜利的道路，永远永远的驰向前！”
