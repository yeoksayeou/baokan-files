    Zheng Yang County Deputy Magistrate Wang Shilin Should Not Infringe Upon Human Rights
    Editor: Zheng Yang County Deputy Magistrate Wang Shilin has repeatedly infringed upon human rights. Last December, when he went to the ninth district to inspect the rush to collect the remaining autumn grain tax, the county's democratic movement was just beginning. Because the district's propaganda policy was insufficient, Wei Dou, a poor peasant in Zhao Village who had been a bandit, feared being struggled against in the movement and committed suicide on December 25th. After the incident occurred, the district people's government reported it to the county public security bureau. The next day, the county public security bureau sent worker Li Qingyun to investigate, but he did not obtain the true situation. Deputy Magistrate Wang Shilin subjectively believed that Wei Dou had been strangled to death by the enemy and insisted on "solving the case." Li Qingyun suggested to Wang Shilin, "The situation has not been clarified, do not blindly solve the case." Wang Shilin angrily said, "Am I, as a county magistrate, not even in charge of a worker?" That day, Wang Shilin personally led militiamen to Zhao Village to arrest six people and brought them back to the ninth district people's government for interrogation. After the interrogation, he realized that he had arrested the wrong people. Thereupon, he said to the six arrested people, "I did not arrest you, but rather asked you for information." He then released them. On February 10th of this year, Wang Shilin mistakenly arrested another person in the ninth district. The situation was as follows: Zhang Dianjia (poor peasant) from Zhang Xinmiao Township, Xi County, went to Songdian Township, Zheng Yang County ninth district, to collect a debt from Wei Shoude (poor peasant), and a dispute occurred between the two parties. Wei Shoude falsely accused Wang Shilin, saying, "Zhang Dianjia is the bandit bully Zhang Huchen, who has now fled to my house, please arrest him and bring him to justice." Wang Shilin did not investigate the situation in detail and personally filled out the arrest warrant, arrested Zhang Dianjia, and sent him to the county people's court for detention. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Dianjia was indeed a poor peasant from Zhang Xinmiao, Xi County, and not a bandit bully.
    Wang Shilin's arbitrary infringement of human rights has had a very bad impact among the masses. We suggest that the Xinyang Special District conduct an inspection.

    正阳县副县长王士林不该侵犯人权
    编辑同志：河南省正阳县副县长王士林屡次侵犯人权。去年十二月他到九区检查突击秋征尾欠工作时，正当本县民主运动开始。由于该区宣传政策不够，赵庄村有一个当过土匪的贫农魏斗，怕在运动中被斗争，在十二月二十五日自杀。事件发生后，该区人民政府报告了县公安局。次日，县公安局派工作员李清云前去调查，但没有得到真实情况。副县长王士林却主观地认为魏斗是被敌人勒死的，强要“破案”。李清云向王士林建议说：“情况没有搞清，不要盲目破案。”王士林恼怒地说：“我当个县长，还当不了你一个工作员的家吗？”当天，王士林亲自带领民兵到赵庄村逮捕了六个人，带回九区人民政府审问。审问后知道捕错了，于是，他对这六个被逮捕的人说：“我不是逮捕你们，而是向你们问情况。”随后就释放了他们。今年二月十日，王士林在九区又错捕一人。情况是这样的：息县张新庙乡张殿甲（贫农）到正阳县九区宋店乡向魏守德（贫农）讨账，双方发生争执。魏守德向王士林诬告说：“张殿甲就是土匪恶霸张虎臣，现逃到我家，请政府逮捕法办。”王士林也没有详细地了解情况，就亲自填写了逮捕票，把张殿甲逮捕，送交县人民法院扣押。经审讯后，知道张殿甲确是息县张新庙的贫农，不是土匪恶霸。
    王士林这样任意侵犯人权的行为，在群众中已造成极不好的影响。我们建议信阳专署进行检查。
