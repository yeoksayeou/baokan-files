Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa: The entire commanders and fighters of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a telegram to Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against the US. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Commander Peng and all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army:

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against the US, we, on the southwestern frontier of the motherland, extend our sincerest greetings to you.

For more than a year, you have fought side by side with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, heroically and selflessly and heavily striking the American aggressor army and its accomplices. Your heroic deeds have made incomparable and glorious contributions to the motherland, the Korean people, and world peace. We warmly congratulate you on your great achievements.

At the same time, we warmly congratulate you and the Korean People's Army on the great victory of annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops and destroying and damaging 533 enemy aircraft in May. This victory, as well as many previous battles, fully demonstrates the indisputable fact that the Chinese and Korean people's forces are becoming stronger as they fight. No matter what despicable and rogue methods the American bandits use on the battlefield and in negotiations, we firmly believe that their inevitable fate of defeat is inescapable.

Your contributions to the Korean people and the motherland inspire the people of the whole country and the people of the world with the conviction that they will win against the aggressors. We, on the frontier of the motherland, are determined to learn from your great spirit and express our respect with practical actions to strengthen border construction and more firmly defend the southwest national defense.

We also hope to convey our warm and distant regards to the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and General Kim Il-sung.

All commanders and fighters of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
June 25th

    【新华社拉萨电】中国人民解放军西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员在朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年纪念日，电中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员及全体指挥员、战斗员致敬。电文如下：彭司令员及志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    当朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年之际，我们在祖国的西南边疆，谨以至诚向你们致敬。
    一年多以来，你们和朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军并肩作战，英勇忘我地和沉重地打击了美国侵略军及其帮凶。你们的英雄行为对祖国、对朝鲜人民和世界和平，作了无比光辉的贡献，我们热烈祝贺你们的伟大成就。
    同时我们热烈祝贺你们和朝鲜人民军在五月份内歼敌一万多名，毁伤敌机五百三十三架的重大胜利。这一胜利及以往许多战例，充分说明中朝人民部队愈战愈强的不可争辩的事实。美国强盗不论在战场上和谈判中采用任何可耻无赖的手段，我们坚信其必败的命运是无可逃避的。
    你们对朝鲜人民和祖国的贡献，鼓舞着全国人民和全世界人民反对侵略者的必胜信念。在祖国边疆的我们，决心学习你们的伟大精神，以加强边疆建设，更巩固地保卫西南国防的实际行动，来表示我们的敬意。
    并望能将我们热烈的、遥远的敬意，转致朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和金日成将军。
    中国人民解放军西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员
    六月二十五日
