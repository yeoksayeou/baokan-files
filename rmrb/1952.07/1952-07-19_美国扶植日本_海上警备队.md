Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The embryo of a regular Japanese navy is growing under the incubation of the United States. This embryo of the new navy is the so-called "Maritime Safety Force." Kyodo News says: "The Maritime Safety Force is equivalent to a maritime national police reserve force."

The "Maritime Safety Force" was established on April 28 and is now attached to the "Maritime Safety Agency." According to the Yoshida government's plan, the force will eventually be under the "Security Agency" to be established, as an independent naval force.

The "Maritime Safety Force" has a total of 7,000 personnel, and 3,000 have already been recruited. They are being trained under the guidance of the American "Military Advisory Group." The first batch of officers has completed training in Yokosuka. Many of them are former Japanese naval officers. The weapons for these new Japanese naval officers and soldiers will be supplied by the United States. According to Kyodo News, the weapons borrowed from the US military include: 3.5-inch mortars, 40mm and 20mm machine guns.

The "Maritime Safety Force's" ships also come from the United States. The US Congress recently approved lending Japan eighteen escort destroyers and fifty landing craft. The "Maritime Safety Force" personnel will soon serve on these ships. These ships will be based at the former Japanese naval bases of Yokosuka, Maizuru, Kure, Sasebo, and Ominato, and will use the barracks and equipment of the former Japanese Navy that are still retained.

According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Yoshida government is holding preliminary negotiations with the US government, preparing to lease several 4,000-ton destroyers from the United States next year to expand Japan's naval power. At the same time, the Yoshida government is also considering building about twenty fast patrol boats. These patrol boats will have a displacement of between 1,000 and 1,500 tons and a sailing speed of 30 knots per hour. According to Japanese National Radio, in order to rush the construction of Japanese ships, the Yoshida government will publicly re-employ former Japanese naval shipbuilding experts who have experience in manufacturing giant battleships and aircraft carriers.

    美国扶植日本“海上警备队”
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本正规海军的雏形正在美国的孵育下成长着。这个新海军的雏形就是所谓“海上警备队”。共同社说：“海上警备队相当于海上的国家警察后备队”。
    “海上警备队”是四月二十八日成立的，现在附设在“海上保安厅”。按照吉田政府的计划，该队最后将隶属于准备成立的“保安厅”，作为独立的海军部队。
    “海上警备队”的员额共计七千人，现已招募到三千人，他们正在美国“军事顾问团”的指导下受训。第一批军官已在横须贺受训完毕，他们当中有许多人都是前日本海军军官。这些日本新海军官兵的武器，将由美国供给。据共同社透露，由美军借给的武器有：口径三点五英寸的迫击炮、口径四十公厘和二十公厘的机关枪。
    “海上警备队”的舰艇也来自美国。美国国会最近已批准借给日本护航快舰十八艘和登陆艇五十艘。“海上警备队”人员即将在这些舰艇上服役。这些舰艇将以前日本海军基地横须贺、舞鹤、吴港、佐世保和大凑为基地，并将使用目前还保留着的前日本海军的营房和设备。
    据“朝日新闻”透露，吉田政府正与美国政府举行初步谈判，准备在明年再向美国租借若干艘四千吨级的驱逐舰，以扩充日本海军的力量。同时，吉田政府自己也在考虑要建造约二十艘快速巡逻艇。这些巡逻艇的排水量将从一千吨到一千五百吨不等，航行的速率为每小时三十海里。据日本国家电台说为了赶造日本船舰，吉田政府将公开起用有制造巨型战斗舰和航空母舰的经验的前日本海军造船专家。
