　　Excerpts from Letters to the Editor
    Workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway Line Urgently Need Cultural Nourishment
    We work on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway Line, the great artery of the Northwest. We urgently need cultural nourishment. However, apart from newspapers, we can't find any new books or periodicals here. As a result, even low-grade, vulgar books smuggled in by private merchants are snapped up by the workers. We hope that the publishing and distribution departments can send book mobile sales teams here to meet the cultural needs of the workers.

　　Goods on Trains Should Be Loaded Properly
    Recently, some freight cars have experienced cargo falling off due to improper loading. For example, Train No. 13266, which departed from Shanhaiguan on June 11, and Train No. 13336, which departed from Shanhaiguan on June 17, both dropped soybean cakes along the way. On June 17, freight train No. 13330, traveling from Shanhaiguan to Tianjin, discovered a package of dried shrimp about to fall off in Xinhe Station. Although the items were reloaded, it caused the train to be delayed by fourteen minutes. In order to ensure the successful realization of the full load, exceeding axle weight, and the 500-kilometer movement, I suggest that the relevant departments learn from these lessons and not only strive for full loads when loading goods but also ensure they are loaded securely.

    Suggestion to Improve the Method of Paying Water and Electricity Bills
    Currently, all branches of the People's Bank of China in Beijing handle the business of collecting water and electricity fees. Every time the water company and electricity company's payment deadlines arrive, the citizens paying the fees are always extremely crowded. The amount paid by the citizens is generally only a few thousand yuan, but they have to wait in line for a long time, which is very inconvenient for the citizens paying.
    I suggest that the above two companies, through the police stations and citizens' organizations, organize the citizens paying the fees, select representatives to go to the bank to pay collectively, and stagger the payment deadline within a month. This will save a lot of manpower and eliminate crowding.    A Citizen
    After Middle School Enrollment in Various Regions
    Unsuccessful Applicants' Photos Should Be Returned
    Many middle schools in various regions stipulate when enrolling students that the two 2-inch bareheaded photos submitted by the applicants will "not be returned regardless of whether they are admitted or not." I think this regulation is very unreasonable. We peasant children can't even bear to buy a meal when we go to the city to take the middle school entrance exam, so we always bring our own dry food. Taking photos not only costs more than ten thousand yuan, but it is also very difficult in the rural environment. It is a great loss to the peasant children taking the middle school entrance exams if the schools casually throw away the photos of those who were not admitted. It is hoped that the middle schools in various regions will take into account the difficulties of the working people and return all the photos of those who were not admitted.    Wang Lu

　　来信摘要
    天兰线工人迫切需要文化食粮
    我们在祖国西北的大动脉——天兰线上工作。我们迫切需要文化食粮。但是，我们这里除了报纸以外，看不到任何新的书刊。因此，有些私商贩运来的低级庸俗的书籍，也被工人们抢购一空。我们希望出版发行部门能够派遣书籍巡回贩卖组到这里来，以满足工人们文化生活的需要。

　　应该把列车上的货物装好
    最近有个别货车，因为货物没有装好，发生了掉货现象。如六月十一日从山海关开出的一三二六六次车，和六月十七日从山海关开出的一三三三六次车，都曾在途中掉下豆饼。六月十七日一三三三○次货物列车，由山海关开往天津途中，在新河站发现车上所载虾皮一包，快要掉下。当时虽把东西重新装好，但却使列车晚开十四分钟。为了保证满载、超轴、五百公里运动的胜利实现，我建议有关部门接受这些教训，在装货时不但争取满载，同时还要装得牢固。    马济安
    建议改进交纳水电费的办法
    目前北京市人民银行各办事处都办理代收自来水费、电灯费的业务。每到自来水公司和电灯公司限定的交款日期，交款的市民总是拥挤不堪。市民们所交款数，一般只是几千元，但却要排队等候很久，这对缴款市民是很不方便的。
    我建议上述两公司，通过派出所和市民组织，把交款市民组织起来，选派代表集中到银行缴纳；并把缴款限期在一月内分开排列。这样，就会节省很多人力，消除拥挤现象。    一市民
    各地中学招生后
    应退还未录取者的相片
    各地很多中等学校在招生时规定：投考者所交二寸半身免冠相片两张，“不论录取与否，概不退还”。我认为这个规定是很不合理的。我们农民子弟，到城里投考中学，连买顿饭吃都不舍得，总是带着干粮去。照相，不但要化一万多元，而且在农村环境中是非常不容易的。学校把没有被录取者的相片随便丢了，对投考中学的农民子弟是一个很大的损失。希望各地中等学校照顾劳动人民的困难，把没有被录取者的照片一律退还。    王    鲁
