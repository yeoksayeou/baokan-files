Xinhua News Agency, July 9th dispatch from Chicago (TASS): The Republican National Convention opened in Chicago on July 7th. The purpose of the convention is to select Republican candidates for president and vice president, and to formulate a campaign platform. A total of 1,206 delegates from 48 states and American territories such as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands attended.

American newspapers said that this convention was "a major American event."

A fundamental characteristic of this convention is that the attending delegates absolutely do not represent the American people, and do not even represent the lower-level members of the Republican Party. Most of the delegates are party hacks, corporate lawyers, and capitalists.

Illinois Democratic Senator Douglas admitted a few weeks ago when talking about the Republican and Democratic national conventions, "The delegates attending these two conventions do not truly represent the people, they only represent the professional politicians of the two parties." Or, as "U.S. News & World Report" said, "It is not the voters, but the politicians who decide who has the opportunity to run for president."

Among the delegates attending the convention, a small number were elected through sham procedures in the so-called "primaries" before the convention. In all forty-eight states, delegates from thirty-three states are elected by the state and county party conventions—that is, they are handpicked by small cliques of political bosses in these states, who will decide whether their delegates vote for Taft or Eisenhower, or, in the event of an irresolvable deadlock, vote for a third presidential candidate.

In some southern states, the Republican Party exists only in name and not in reality. The party bosses in these places sell the votes they represent to Taft or Eisenhower according to price. The "New York Times" said on July 6th that in the southern states, "Republican organizations exist for only one purpose—to send delegates to the convention in order to gain some benefits."

According to the latest statistics from the Associated Press, Taft currently has 530 delegates (including those from the Southern states given to him by the National Committee), Eisenhower has 427 delegates, and Warren, Stassen, or others have 131 delegates. 118 delegates have not yet clearly expressed their attitude towards the presidential candidates. Their votes can play a decisive role.

Which side these votes turn to does not depend on the situation in the convention hall; the content of this convention is almost entirely limited to ceremonial rituals and empty, cliché-ridden speeches. The real work of the convention is being done in the elegant hotels along Lake Michigan.

The Republican platform has been drafted by a small group of party leaders, with the part concerning foreign policy drafted by Dulles. This draft platform will be submitted to the convention on July 9th. Just as in the matter of presidential and vice-presidential nominations, the task of most delegates is only to rubber-stamp the decisions already made by a small group of the party's top leaders, who in turn act according to the instructions of the large financial groups.

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th dispatch from New York: On the eve of the opening of the Republican National Convention in the United States, the two main Republican presidential candidates, Eisenhower and Taft, used every means to attack each other in order to win the election. Intense infighting occurred within the Republican Party, staging a series of farces that exposed the truth of the American democratic system.

In this dispute, the Taft faction, having historically controlled the Republican Party machinery, was able to exclude the newly arrived Eisenhower supporters in many cases. For example, in Georgia, Taft faction party hacks hid in cars to hold county delegate selection meetings, making it impossible for Eisenhower supporters to attend. In Alabama, the Taft faction chairman deprived the Eisenhower supporters present of their voting rights; at a county delegate selection meeting in Virginia, Eisenhower supporters were forcibly driven out of the meeting place by Taft supporters; at a precinct meeting in Louisiana, the Taft faction chairman simply took over, nominating himself as a delegate to the state convention, then immediately declared the nomination closed, himself elected, and the meeting adjourned, thus making it impossible for the Eisenhower supporters attending the meeting to intervene at all. In Texas, the Taft faction party chairman rejected the qualifications of the Eisenhower faction's delegates and sent Taft faction people to serve as delegates instead. Particularly fierce bickering occurred over the qualifications of the ninety-six delegates from several southern states. Many of these "delegates" from the South, which has always been controlled by the Democratic Party, were bought with money. However, both factions tried their best to claim that their own faction's delegates were "legally elected" delegates, who had the right to represent the non-existent Republican Party in each of these states. This dispute has continued to the point where it has become the first intractable problem at the current National Convention held in Chicago.

The various means used by the Taft faction have aroused great anger in Eisenhower, who openly scolded the Taft faction for using "base means" to "steal" his delegates. His chief campaign manager, Senator Lodge, also accused Taft of adopting "deceitful" and "illegal" methods. But Taft also pointed out that the methods used by the Eisenhower faction were actually not much different. He said, "In terms of ruthless practices at the various conventions, wherever Eisenhower's people are in power, that's what they do. I don't understand why it shouldn't be the same way when Taft's people are in power." For example, in Connecticut, a convention controlled by the Eisenhower faction elected an all-Eisenhower-supporting delegation. The Taft faction also believes that the Eisenhower faction's attacks are detrimental to the Republican Party's electoral interests, and therefore demanded that the Eisenhower faction stop the "smear campaign."

The power struggle between the Taft and Eisenhower factions has created the most intense competition within the Republican Party in decades. It has caused concern among many Republican elders, who feel that such a struggle will only expose the corruption of the Republican Party itself and may cause the Republican Party to fail in the November election. Elders led by Hoover have launched a series of "mediation" activities within the Republican Party, attempting to find a basis that can satisfy the demands of both factions.

The famous reactionary American journalists, the Alsop brothers, wrote in the "Chicago Sun-Times": "If the candidate who wins the competition has to advance through a river of blood shed by his own brothers, then you cannot help but wonder how the Republican Party will win in the November election."

### 在美国共和党全国代表大会上  艾森豪威尔派和塔夫脱派吵得难分难解

    在美国共和党全国代表大会上
    艾森豪威尔派和塔夫脱派吵得难分难解
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社芝加哥八日讯：共和党全国代表大会已于七月七日在芝加哥开幕。大会目的是要选出共和党总统和副总统候选人，并制订竞选纲领。到会的有四十八州和阿拉斯加、夏威夷、波多黎各和维尔京群岛等美国领地的代表共一千二百零六人。
    美国报纸说这次大会是“美国一大盛事”。
    这次大会一个基本特点就是，出席的代表绝不代表美国人民，甚至代表不了共和党的下层党员。大多数代表都是党棍、公司律师和资本家。
    伊利诺斯州民主党参议员道格拉斯几个星期前谈到共和党和民主党的全国代表大会时曾经承认，“出席这两个大会的代表并不真正代表人民，他们只代表两党的职业政客。”或者，如“美国新闻和世界报道”所说：“决定谁有机会竞选总统的，不是选民，而是政客。”
    出席大会的代表中，有少数是经过装模作样的手续，在大会前的所谓“预选”中选出的。在全部四十八个州里，三十三个州的代表是由州和县的党代表大会选出的——这就是说是由这些州的政治大亨的小集团一手圈定的，他们将决定他们的代表投票选塔夫脱或是选艾森豪威尔，或者在产生无法解决的僵局时投票选举第三个总统竞选人。
    在南部的某些州里，共和党只是名义上存在而实际上并不存在，这些地方的党魁们都把他们代表的选票按价卖给塔夫脱或者艾森豪威尔。“纽约时报”在七月六日说，在南方各州，“共和党组织之所以存在，只为了一个目的——派代表参加大会，以便得些好处。”
    据美联社最新的统计，目前支持塔夫脱的有五百三十个代表（包括全国委员会送给他的南方各州的代表在内），支持艾森豪威尔的有四百二十七个代表，支持华伦、史塔生或别人的有一百三十一个代表。一百一十八个代表还没有明确表示他们对总统竞选人的态度。他们的票能够起决定性的作用。
    这些票要转向那一边，并不取决于大会会场里的情形；这个大会的内容几乎完全限于摆摆样子的仪式和空洞的、俗套的演说。大会的真正工作，是在密执安湖畔那些优雅的旅馆里进行的。
    共和党的竞选纲领已经由一小撮党的头目拟好了，其中有关外交政策的部分是由杜勒斯草拟的。这个纲领草案将在七月九日提交大会。正像在总统、副总统提名的问题上一样，大多数代表的任务只是盖印批准已由一小撮党的最高首脑们作出的决定，而这些最高首脑们又是按照大金融集团的训令行事的。
    【新华社九日讯】纽约消息：在美国共和党全国代表大会开幕前夕，共和党两个主要总统候选人艾森豪威尔和塔夫脱，为了争取当选，用尽一切方法打击对方。共和党内部为此发生了激烈的争吵，演出了一幕幕暴露美国民主制度的真相的活剧。
    在这次争吵中，塔夫脱派由于历来控制着共和党的党机器，因此得以在许多情况下排挤新进的艾森豪威尔分子。例如，在佐治亚州，塔夫脱派党棍躲到了汽车里去举行县的推选代表会议，使得艾森豪威尔派无法参加会议。在亚拉巴马州，塔夫脱派的主席剥夺了到会的艾森豪威尔分子的投票权；在弗吉尼亚州的一次县代表推选会上，艾森豪威尔分子被塔夫脱派用强力赶出了会场；在路易斯安那州的一个选举区会议上，塔夫脱派的主席干脆一手包办，把自己提名为出席州大会代表，接着立即宣布提名完毕，自己当选，会议结束，这样使得出席会议的艾森豪威尔分子根本无从插手。在得克萨斯州，塔夫脱派的党主席否决了艾森豪威尔派的代表资格，而另派出了塔夫脱派的人充当代表。在关于南方几个州的九十六名代表的资格问题上，两派发生了特别激烈的哄争。那些向来为民主党所控制的南方来的“代表”，许多是用钱买来的，然而，两派都竭力标榜自己一派的代表才是“合法选出”的代表，有权代表各该州并不存在的共和党。这个争执一直闹到了目前在芝加哥举行的全国代表大会成为会上头一个难分难解的问题。
    塔夫脱派使用的这种种手段，已惹起艾森豪威尔的极大恼怒，他公开骂塔夫脱派使用“卑贱的手段”，“偷去”了他的代表，他的主要竞选活动主持人参议员洛奇也斥责塔夫脱采取了“奸诈”和“枉法”的办法。但是塔夫脱也指出：艾森豪威尔派的手段实际上也差不多，他说：“就各代表大会上的无情做法来说，凡是艾森豪威尔的人当权的地方，他们就这样做。我不懂为什么塔夫脱的人专权就不应该同样做法。”例如在康涅狄格州，艾森豪威尔派控制的代表大会就曾选出了清一色的支持艾森豪威尔的代表团。塔夫脱派还认为艾森豪威尔派对他们的攻击有损于共和党的选举利益，因此而要求艾森豪威尔派停止“污蔑运动”。
    塔夫脱和艾森豪威尔两派的权利争夺，造成了共和党内部几十年来最激烈的竞争。它已引起许多共和党元老的忧虑，他们感到这样的斗争只会暴露共和党本身的腐败，可能会使共和党在十一月大选中失败。以胡佛为首的元老们已在共和党内展开了一连串“调解”活动，企图找到能够同时满足两派权利要求的基础。
    美国著名的反动记者阿尔索普兄弟在“芝加哥太阳时报”上撰文说：“如果竞争获胜的候选人不得不踏过自己弟兄的流成河的血而前进的话，那么你免不了要怀疑，共和党怎么会在十一月的大选里获胜。”
