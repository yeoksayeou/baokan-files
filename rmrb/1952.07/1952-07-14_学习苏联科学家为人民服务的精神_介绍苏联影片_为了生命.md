    Learning from the Spirit of Soviet Scientists Serving the People
    ——Introducing the Soviet Film "For Life"
    Ye Yao
    The Soviet film "For Life" depicts the arduous journey of three Soviet medical university graduate students as they research the regeneration of nerve tissue, treat nerve paralysis, and seek ways to extend human life. Because this film portrays the revolutionary spirit of scientists engaged in scientific work, it is of particular educational significance not only for scientific workers, but also has a universal educational role for general revolutionary workers.
    On the road to scientific invention, although the Soviet state has prepared all possible conditions for scientific workers—they are inspired by Stalin's brilliant saying: "Science should be omnipotent," have the Soviet government's meticulous care, and have the research materials of previous scientists as reference—the research and experimentation process itself is by no means a smooth road. As Marx said: "In science, there is no royal road, and only those who do not fear hardship and climb upwards without fear of obstacles can reach the brilliant peak." ("Capital," Volume 1, page 13, Sanlian Bookstore edition) To complete a scientific invention, scientists also need great perseverance and an undiminished enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause in order to succeed.
    The three graduate students of the Soviet Medical University, Petrov, Goresov, and Rozhdestvensky, were exploring and climbing on the road of researching nerve regeneration. When they were about to reach the peak, but had not clearly seen it, Rozhdestvensky and Goresov wavered. Rozhdestvensky suspected that he was on the wrong path and retreated halfway, going to the United States as a scientific visitor and tourist, wanting to find a "shortcut" from American scientists and get some "inspiration," but he ended up accomplishing nothing. Goresov showed retreat in the face of scientific difficulties, lost the courage to move forward, and hid in the small nest of his so-called "happy life," becoming depressed. Only Petrov persevered, continuing to explore the "brilliant peak" of science, and finally achieved victory, making a huge contribution to human happiness and medical research to extend human life. The film depicts the thoughts and personalities of these three people, and carves out this educational theme.
    Petrov succeeded because he regarded scientific research as a collective undertaking, rather than as a means for individuals to obtain fame and gain. Therefore, he believed that whether success or failure, all contributed to scientific work in different senses. He believed that even failure was not a waste of time and energy, because others could learn from the lessons and not repeat his mistakes, so he had unwavering perseverance. The other two were different. Rozhdestvensky felt that he had wasted his time, and Goresov felt that he had sacrificed his personal happiness. The thoughts of these two people are wrong, but they are not entirely the same. Rozhdestvensky's main mistake was that he still had reactionary cosmopolitanism in his scientific work, had illusions about American science, and wanted to solve difficult problems that they could not temporarily solve from there. He said: "Science is the same, no matter who invents it first." Goresov opposed his erroneous argument of non-patriotism, saying:
    "It would be best if our work could be completed by Soviet scientific workers." This is the national self-esteem and self-confidence that scientific workers who love the people and love the motherland should have. Rozhdestvensky lacked this correct attitude, and his failure was by no means accidental. Science cannot be separated from politics. Only when science is in the hands of the people can it benefit mankind. Otherwise, it may become a murder weapon. Recently, isn't the obvious fact that American imperialism is conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China?
    Goresov is a patriotic scientist, but because he is nostalgic for his own small so-called "happy life" and lacks a high degree of confidence in the cause of the people, he also failed in the end.
    All patriotic scientific workers who are willing to serve the people wholeheartedly can learn lessons from the vivid plots in this film. Only by thoroughly eliminating the reactionary and non-patriotic thoughts, abandoning individualistic thoughts, and thoroughly transforming themselves can they better serve the people.
    The film successfully portrays the character of Petrov, not only depicting his work perseverance, but more importantly, showing the victory of collectivist thought over individualistic thought, and the victory of patriotic thought over reactionary cosmopolitanism. At the same time, we also saw the victory of the revolutionary spirit over traditional conservatism and resistance to new forces. The film depicts that at the Soviet Science Conference, people who had opposed Pavlov in the past now stood up to oppose Petrov, advocating that the new scientific discoveries that had been successfully experimented with should still be locked up in the laboratory for "research," while the old ones could still be preserved as they were. The Soviet government fully supported and assisted new things, and conservative ideas that hindered scientific progress were severely criticized. The meeting approved Petrov to continue the surgery.
    The film depicts how eagerly the old typesetter Nazarov had been looking forward to Petrov's successful experiment to heal his daughter's legs that were injured in the war. However, when Petrov's first patient died of a sudden heart attack after the surgery, the old worker was frightened. He did not understand that the surgery itself was not wrong. Afraid of losing his only daughter, he vehemently opposed Petrov, even forcing Petrov to personally admit to his daughter that he could not cure her illness. Petrov refused to say such untrue words. In the end, the old worker was persuaded by Petrov's lover, Lena, with sincere and moving words, and his daughter's disabled legs were cured.
    From here, we are reminded that there are such people in the revolutionary ranks who can withstand the severe tests of the struggle against the enemy, but cannot withstand the temporary misunderstandings and oppositions of friends, especially their own people. They often stand firm in the struggle against the enemy, but when they encounter temporary misunderstandings and oppositions from their own people, they become discouraged, demoralized, feel greatly wronged, and lose the courage to move forward. Such people cannot be regarded as having a complete Bolshevik spirit. All revolutionaries must deeply understand that in order for new things to gain a foothold, you must not only withstand the attacks of hostile and reactionary forces, but also withstand the resistance of traditional old forces. If you retreat in either struggle, it will be difficult to achieve the desired results. Petrov in the film treated everything he encountered with a correct revolutionary attitude, and achieved the final victory. These realistic descriptions have a great educational effect on the audience.
    When depicting the relationships between Petrov and Lena, and Goresov and Vera, the film raises the question of what love should be based on, and the question of how to unify personal happiness and collective interests. These are also educational for young people. Although Petrov and Lena are often not together due to the intensity of their respective work, it does not hinder their love, because their work is all towards one goal—to strive for the cause of human peace. They are both infinitely loyal and passionate about their work, and they link their love to contributions to the broad masses of people. They encourage each other, and love becomes an inspiring force, making them more enthusiastically involved in their work. Finally, they made excellent contributions to the people, and at the same time, their love was also happy.
    But what about Goresov and Vera? Vera is not interested in her technical translation work, admires vanity, and attempts to enjoy personal enjoyment. When Goresov encountered difficulties in his work and wavered, Vera not only did not encourage him, but instead held him back, pulling him from his work post back to her own small world, thinking that this would bring "happiness." But what did she get? It was Goresov's depression and boredom. A person who is separated from work and separated from the collective has no real happiness to speak of. Vera's final repentance and Goresov's final shame are both very natural. This is the bitter fruit borne on the tree of individualism.
    Although this film is about scientific invention activities, it does not make people feel monotonous and boring. In the creation of such themes of films, the Soviet Union has had brilliant achievements in the years after the war. They have made biographical films depicting great Soviet scientists such as "Pavlov," "Michurin," "Father of Russian Aviation," "Genius Inventor" (also known as "Popov"), and "Surgeon." Although "For Life" is not a biography, the materials on which it is based are also authentic in the Soviet scientific community. This film, like other outstanding Soviet scientific art films, not only shows the arduous efforts made by Soviet scientists in pursuing new scientific inventions, but also shows their rich daily life in many aspects. The research process of science, which is generally considered boring, has become poetic material in the hands of filmmakers. The scientists' specialized research materials did not hinder the development of the film's vivid plot; scientific work itself was placed in the film as the main and most touching component of the scientists' lives. This deepened the audience's understanding of the scientists. The scientists we see in the film are not the so-called "cold" people who, apart from the rabbits and monkeys in the laboratory, are isolated from other aspects of life. They love life, and in their lives there is love, poetry, and the life pleasures that ordinary people have. All of this is harmoniously unified, turning into a living picture, as rich and diverse as life itself.
    The film tells us that when American imperialism is waging a war of aggression in Korea, not only cruelly massacring the Korean people with gasoline bombs, but also threatening mankind with bacteriological warfare, defying the world's great disapproval, the scientists of socialist Soviet Union are working hard to study how to extend human life, how to restore the health of people whose nerves were damaged by the guns of Hitler's bandits in World War II, so that they can work again, embrace their relatives, and live the happy life that human beings should have. What a stark contrast!

    学习苏联科学家为人民服务的精神
    ——介绍苏联影片“为了生命”
    叶遥
    苏联影片“为了生命”是描写苏联医科大学的三个研究生，为研究神经组织的再生作用，医治神经麻痹症，寻找延长人类寿命方法所经历的艰苦路程。因为这部影片描写了科学家从事科学工作的革命精神，所以它不仅对科学工作者有特别重大的教育意义，而且对一般革命工作者也同样有它普遍的教育作用。
    在科学发明的道路上，虽然苏联国家为科学工作者准备了一切可能的条件——他们有斯大林：“科学应该是万能的”光辉名言的鼓舞，有苏联政府的无微不至的照顾，并有先辈科学家们的研究材料可作参考，但研究和试验过程的本身，却决不是一条平坦大道。正如马克思所说：“在科学中是没有平坦大路的，只有不怕劳苦，不畏险阻向上攀登的人，才能达到光辉的顶峰。”（“资本论”卷一第一三页，三联书店版）要完成一件科学发明还需要科学家以极大的毅力，和对革命事业永不衰退的热情，才能获得成功。
    苏联医科大学的三个研究生别特洛夫、果列索夫和罗杰特文斯基在研究神经再生作用的道路上，向前探索着，攀登着，在将要达到顶峰，而还没有明确地看到那顶峰时，罗杰特文斯基和果列索夫动摇了。罗杰特文斯基怀疑自己走错了路，半途退却下来，作为一个科学的参观者和游览者去到美国，想从美国科学家那里找到“捷径”，得些“启发”，但他终于一事无成。果列索夫在科学的困难面前表现了退缩，丧失了前进的勇气，躲到个人狭小的所谓“幸福生活”的小窝里，消沉下去。只有别特洛夫坚持下来，继续向科学的“光辉顶峰”探寻，最后得到了胜利，为人类的幸福，为延长人类寿命的医学研究，作了巨大的贡献。影片描写了这三个人的思想和性格，刻划出这个富有教育意义的主题。
    别特洛夫所以获得成功，是因为他把科学研究工作作为集体事业来看待，而不是把它当作个人获取名利的手段。所以他认为无论成功和失败，在不同的意义上全对科学工作作了贡献。他认为，即使失败，也并不是白费时间和精力，因为别人可以接受教训，不再重复他的错误，所以他具有坚贞不渝的毅力。而另外两个人却不同。罗杰特文斯基认为自己白费了时间，果列索夫认为牺牲了个人幸福。他们两个人的思想都是错误的，但却并不完全相同。罗杰特文斯基的主要错误，是他在科学工作上还残存着反动的世界主义思想，对美国的科学存有幻想，想从那里解决他们暂时还不能解决的困难问题。他说：“科学，谁先发明出来都是一样。”果列索夫反对他这种非爱国主义的错误论调，说：
    “我们的工作，最好能由苏联科学工作者来完成。”这是爱人民、爱祖国的科学工作者都应有的民族自尊心和自信心。罗杰特文斯基缺乏这种正确态度，他的失败决不是偶然的。科学是不能脱离政治的。只有把科学掌握在人民手里，它才能为人类造福。否则，它可能变为杀人的凶器。最近，美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战，不是很明显的事实吗？
    果列索夫是个爱国的科学家，但因为他留恋个人狭小的所谓“幸福生活”，对于人民的事业缺乏高度的信心，他最后也失败了。
    一切爱国的，愿意全心全意为人民服务的科学工作者，可以从这影片中的生动情节接受教训，只有彻底肃清反动的非爱国主义的思想，抛弃掉个人主义思想，彻底改造自己，才能更好地为人民服务。
    影片成功地表现了别特洛夫这个人物，不仅描写了他的工作毅力，而且更重要的是表现了集体主义思想和个人主义思想斗争的胜利，以及爱国主义思想与反动的世界主义思想斗争的胜利。同时我们还看到了革命精神与传统的因循守旧、抵抗新生力量斗争的胜利。影片描写了在苏维埃科学会议上，过去曾反对过巴甫洛夫的人，现在又起来反对别特洛夫，主张把实验成功了的科学新发现，仍关进试验室里“研究”，而旧的却可以照样保存下来。苏联政府全力支持和扶助新生的东西，阻碍科学进步的守旧思想遭到了严厉批判。会议批准别特洛夫可以继续作手术。
    影片描写了老排字工人那札尔根，曾经以多么热切的心情期待别特洛夫的试验成功，给自己的女儿医好在战争中神经受伤的两腿。但当别特洛夫的第一个患者在施手术后因突发的心脏病而死亡时，老工人被吓住了，他不了解手术本身并没有错误。他害怕失掉自己唯一的女儿，便激烈地反对别特洛夫，甚至逼迫别特洛夫去亲自对他的女儿承认不能治她的病。别特洛夫拒绝说出那样不符事实的话。最后，老工人被别特洛夫的爱人列娜，用真诚动人的话说服了，他的女儿的残废的双腿被治愈了。
    从这里我们想起了在革命队伍里有这么一种人，他们经得住对敌斗争的严重考验，但却经不起朋友，尤其是自己人暂时的误会和反对。他们常常在与敌人的斗争中屹立不动，但遇到自己人的暂时的误会和反对时，就灰心，气馁，觉得受了莫大的委屈，丧失了前进的勇气。这种人，同样不能算是具备了完整的布尔什维克精神。一切革命者都必须深刻地了解，要想使新的东西立定脚跟，你不但要经得起敌对的、反动势力的袭击，而且也要经得起传统的旧势力的抵抗。如果你无论在那一种斗争中退缩下来，便很难达到预想的结果。影片中的别特洛夫以正确的革命的态度对待了他所遇到的一切，便获得了最后的胜利。这些真实的描写，对观众的教育作用是大的。
    影片在描写别特洛夫和列娜，果列索夫和微拉的关系时，提出了一个恋爱应以什么为基础的问题，个人幸福和集体利益应该统一起来的问题。这些对青年也是有教育意义的。别特洛夫和列娜虽则由于各自工作的紧张，经常不在一起，但却并不妨碍他们的爱情，因为他们的工作都是朝向一个目标——为人类和平事业而努力。他们对自己的工作都无限忠诚和热爱，他们把爱情联系在对广大人民的贡献上。他们互相鼓励，爱情变成了鼓舞的力量，使他们更加热情地投入工作。终于他们对人民作了优异的贡献，同时他们的爱情也是幸福的。
    但是果列索夫和微拉呢？微拉对自己的技术翻译工作不感兴趣，爱慕虚荣，企图个人享受。当果列索夫在工作中遇到困难，发生动摇时，微拉不但不鼓励他，反去扯他的后腿，把他从工作岗位上拉回到自己的小天地里，认为这样可以得到“快乐”。但她所得到的是什么呢？是果列索夫的消沉，苦闷。一个脱离工作，脱离集体的人，是没有什么真正的快乐可言的。微拉最后的悔悟，果列索夫最后的惭愧，都是很自然的。这是个人主义的树上所结的苦果。
    这部影片虽然是描写科学发明活动的影片，但它并不使人感到单调和枯燥无味。在创制这类题材的影片方面，苏联于战后数年间，曾有辉煌的成就。他们曾拍制了像“巴甫洛夫”、“米丘林”、“俄罗斯航空之父”、“天才发明家”（又名“波波夫”）、“外科医生”等描写苏联伟大科学家的传记片。“为了生命”虽不是传记片，但它所根据的材料在苏联科学界也是有真实性的。这部电影也和其他苏联杰出的科学艺术片一样，不但表现了苏联科学家在为追求科学的新发明上所作的艰苦努力，也表现了他们多方面的丰富的日常生活。一般人认为枯燥的科学的研究过程，在影片制作者手里变成了富有诗意的素材。科学家的专门研究材料并未妨碍影片的生动情节的发展；科学工作本身，是被作为科学家生活中主要的、最动人的成分放进影片里去的。这更加深了观众对科学家的了解。我们在影片里看到的科学家，不是所谓除去试验室里的兔子、猴子之外，便与其他方面的生活绝缘的、“冰冷”的人。他们热爱生活，在他们的生活里有爱情，有诗歌，有常人所有的生活乐趣。这一切，都被协调地统一起来，变成了活的图画，像生活本身那么丰富多样。
    影片告诉我们，当美帝国主义正在朝鲜进行侵略战争，不但残酷地用汽油弹屠杀朝鲜人民，还冒天下之大不韪，拿细菌战来威胁人类的时候，社会主义苏联的科学家们，却在艰苦地研究着如何延长人类寿命的问题，如何使在第二次世界大战中被希特勒匪徒的枪炮打坏了神经的人恢复健康，让他们重新工作，去拥抱他们的亲人，过人类应有的幸福生活。这是多么鲜明的对比！
