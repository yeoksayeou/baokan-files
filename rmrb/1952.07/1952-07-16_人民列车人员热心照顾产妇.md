People's Train Staff Warmly Take Care of the Mother

Editor:

At 1:00 PM on June 15th, on train 219 from Shijiazhuang to Beijing, a woman gave birth. Knowing that childbirth during a journey is a difficult thing, I went to visit her. A woman in her forties said to the train conductor, "We should get the mother something to eat." This train was a short-distance train and had no dining car. The conductor, Qin Zhigang, was very troubled. I gave the glucose I had with me to the attendant, and asked him to mix it with warm water for the mother to drink. Through the crack in the door, I saw the mother resting, and a healthy and adorable baby was lying on the seat in the attendant's rest area.

The conductor told me that the mother was the wife of revolutionary soldier Xu Youde and was returning to her hometown in Northeast China. He noticed that the mother was about to give birth and immediately mobilized passengers who knew about midwifery to help her. The woman in her forties, surnamed Kong, volunteered to help the mother deliver the baby.

When the train stopped at Changxindian, the conductor immediately called Fengtai Station to prepare arrangements for the mother. Twenty minutes later, the train arrived at Fengtai, and a stretcher was already prepared on the platform. The mother and baby were comfortably taken to the hospital.

This incident deeply moved me. Only railway staff led and educated by Chairman Mao can serve the people so patiently and thoughtfully.

    人民列车人员热心照顾产妇
    编辑同志：六月十五日下午一点钟，由石家庄开往北京的二一九次列车中，有一个妇女生了孩子。我知道妇女在旅途中生产，是一件苦事，就走去看望她。有一位四十多岁的妇女向列车长说：“应该给产妇弄点东西吃。”这次列车是短途列车，并无餐车。车长秦芷岗很为难。我就把身边带的葡萄糖拿给乘务员，让他用温开水冲给产妇喝，我隔着门缝，看见产妇正在休息，乘务员休息室的座位上，躺着一个健康可爱的婴儿。
    列车长告诉我，产妇是革命军人徐友德的爱人，要回东北家乡。他发觉产妇要生产了，马上动员了懂得接生的乘客来帮助她。那位姓孔的四十多岁的妇女，就是自愿出来帮助产妇接生的。
    列车在长辛店停站时，列车长马上打电话通知丰台车站，准备安置产妇。二十分钟后，列车到达丰台，月台上已准备好了一付担架。产妇和婴儿舒适地被送到医院中去了。
    这件事深深地感动了我。只有毛主席领导教育下的铁路工作人员，才能这样耐心周密地为人民服务啊。    全国妇联妇女干部学校校长    刘清扬
