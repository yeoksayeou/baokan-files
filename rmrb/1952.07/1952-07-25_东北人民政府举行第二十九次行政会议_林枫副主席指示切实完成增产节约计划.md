Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: The Northeast People's Government held its 29th administrative meeting on July 18th. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, gave important instructions on how to conscientiously complete the production increase and savings plan.

    Lin Feng pointed out that in order to effectively complete the industrial production increase and savings plan, firstly, it is necessary to overcome the current imbalance in the production increase and savings movement, so that the production increase and savings movement in state-owned industries and local industries, factories under the industrial departments and factories in other departments, and public and private industries can develop in a balanced manner. Secondly, in completing the plan, it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of being lax at first and then tightening up later, so that the production increase and savings movement will be consistently full of vigor and strength. Thirdly, special attention must be paid to improving product quality, and factories, mines, and advanced producers that improve product quality in the production increase and savings movement should be promptly rewarded and commended. Fourthly, advanced experiences should be further promoted, and special attention should be paid to promoting advanced experiences that are decisive in driving overall production. Fifthly, attention should be paid to security work and the welfare of employees in production.

    Regarding the leadership of the industrial production increase and savings movement, Lin Feng pointed out that the Communist Party organizations, administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League in each unit must be consistent in their steps, and must regularly check, discover, and solve key problems. The People's Economic Planning Committee must effectively grasp the movement's situation, strengthen planning, and enable various departments to cooperate with each other. Lin Feng pointed out that integrating industrial production increase and savings with improving business management and raising business management to a higher level is a fundamental and major issue. Doing this well will prepare favorable conditions for large-scale economic construction in the future.

    Regarding capital construction, Lin Feng emphatically pointed out that it is necessary to conscientiously summarize and promote advanced experiences in the capital construction departments, effectively guarantee quality, and mobilize and rely on employees to establish a strict responsibility system; local people's governments should assist industrial departments in inspecting capital construction work and strengthen political work in the capital construction departments. In order to do a good job in next year's capital construction work, he instructed the Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee and relevant departments to seize the time in the second half of this year to make preparations.

    Lin Feng also gave important instructions on agricultural production increase, saying that it is necessary to demand more grain and cotton, strive for a bumper harvest, and ensure the completion of agricultural production increase tasks. Agricultural departments and agricultural schools at all levels must seize the opportunity to organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections in rural areas, especially in important grain-producing and cotton-producing areas, and do a solid job in hoeing and weeding and prevent pests and diseases.

    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北人民政府七月十八日举行第二十九次行政会议。东北人民政府副主席林枫对如何切实完成增产节约计划作了重要指示。
    林枫指出：为了切实完成工业增产节约计划，第一，要克服目前增产节约运动中的不平衡现象，使国家工业和地方工业，工业部所属工厂和其他部门的工厂，公营工业和私营工业中的增产节约运动平衡发展。第二，在完成计划上，要克服先松后紧的现象，使增产节约运动始终如一地饱满有力。第三，要特别注意提高产品质量，及时奖励和表扬增产节约运动中提高产品质量的厂、矿和先进生产者。第四，要进一步推广先进经验，特别要注意推广对带动整个生产具有决定性的先进经验。第五，要注意生产当中的保安工作和职工福利工作。
    关于工业增产节约运动的领导问题，林枫指出：各单位的共产党的组织和行政、工会、青年团必须步调一致，要经常检查、发现和解决关键性的问题。人民经济计划委员会要切实掌握运动情况，加强计划性，使各部门互相配合。林枫指出：要把工业增产节约和改进经营管理结合起来，使经营管理工作提高一步，这是一个具有根本性的重大问题。这件事做好了，就给今后大规模经济建设准备了有利条件。
    关于基本建设问题，林枫着重指出：必须在基本建设部门中认真总结与推广先进经验，切实保证质量，发动和依靠职工建立严格的责任制；各地人民政府要协助工业部门检查基本建设工作，并在基本建设部门中加强政治工作。为了做好明年的基本建设工作，他责成东北人民经济计划委员会和各有关部门在今年下半年抓紧时间进行准备工作。
    关于农业增产问题林枫也作了重要指示，他说：必须要求多打粮食，多收棉花，争取丰收，保证农业增产任务的完成。各级人民政府农业部门和农业学校要抓紧时机，组织力量，深入农村检查，特别要到重要产粮区和产棉区进行检查，把铲、趟地的工作切实作好，防止病虫害。
