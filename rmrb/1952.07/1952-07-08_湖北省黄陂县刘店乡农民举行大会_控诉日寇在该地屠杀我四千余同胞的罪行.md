Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 7th: More than 1,000 peasants in Liudian Township, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, held a meeting to accuse Japanese invaders of their massacre crimes on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, demanding severe punishment for Japanese war criminals and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism by the United States. Representatives from various democratic parties, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Christian groups, and Buddhist groups in Wuhan also participated in the meeting. Peasants from nearby townships in Liudian Township also rushed to accuse the Japanese invaders of the crimes they had suffered.

Yiganshan, Liudian Township, is one of the recently discovered sites of mass killings of our people by Japanese fascists during their invasion of China (located twenty miles northeast of Wuhan). From the time the Japanese invaders occupied Wuhan to their surrender, over the course of seven years, the Japanese invaders massacred more than 4,000 Chinese people here, most of whom were Communists, New Fourth Army soldiers, patriotic people, workers, peasants, and other working people.

Before the meeting, the peasants, with heavy hearts, carried out the work of excavating bones at this massacre site. The day before each killing, the Japanese invaders always brought the victims here and forced them to dig the ditches. The next day, they would bring them to the edge of the ditches and kill them, burying them in the ditches. Currently, more than sixty ditches have been discovered. In just three hours, the peasants excavated 831 sets of bones from sixteen ditches. Some of the bones were still tied with ropes, and large patches of bloodstains could still be faintly seen on the clothes that had not completely rotted. In addition to the bones, many wine bottles were also unearthed, which were discarded by the Japanese invaders after drinking before the killings.

The meeting place was set up on the site where the Japanese invaders committed their crimes. Peasants Zhou Maojie, Du Songshan, Du Qiwang, Guan Deshi, and victims Peng Yunshan and Zhang Furong, who witnessed the large-scale massacre by the Japanese invaders in the area, angrily accused them at the meeting. They said that every time the Japanese invaders killed people, they set up sentry posts around the killing ditches. After the cars transported the bound victims to the killing field, the Japanese invaders guarding them would cover their eyes with white cloth, and then the drunk executioners would lead them one by one to the front of the ditches, lining them up along the ditches. When the executioners killed our compatriots, they first cut a knife on their necks, and then kicked the victims' bodies into the ditches. After the killing, they would fire shots into the air and howl away. Zhou Maojie said that in February 1939, he personally saw a young man in his twenties shouting "Long live the Communist Party!" when the Japanese invaders were killing people. He ran out of the killing ditch, but was unfortunately tripped by the grass. Three Japanese invaders caught up and stabbed him to death. The second time he saw the Japanese invaders killing people from twelve noon until the lights were lit at night. He saw the executioners wearing armbands with the white characters "警" (police) on a black background, which was the mark of the Japanese invaders' Wuhan Garrison. He said, "Remember! These dog robbers are the ones who killed people. We must resolutely demand blood debts from these people!" Du Qiwang saw more than one hundred people being killed four times, one of which was at night, and one Japanese invader killed more than a dozen people. Guan Deshi saw a teenager angrily shouting "Chinese people must never work for Japanese devils!" before his death in June 1942. Guan Deshi said, "The old hatred has not been avenged, and American imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism again. We will never allow it to kill us again. We resolutely demand severe punishment for war criminals and avenge our dead compatriots!" The seventy-two-year-old peasant Peng Yunshan said, "My only son was brutally killed by the Japanese devils, leaving me helpless for more than ten years. We must avenge the dead compatriots!"

Representatives from all walks of life in Wuhan also spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning the Japanese invaders' atrocities. They said that the Chinese people, who have stood up under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, must avenge the dead compatriots. We have the confidence and determination to defeat the American imperialists' aggressive plot to revive Japanese militarism and safeguard world peace.

Finally, Wu Jie, Deputy Procurator-General of the Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate, said, "The bloodstains of the crimes committed by Japanese fascists in China have not yet dried, and American imperialism has actually declared the separate 'peace treaty' with Japan to be in effect, and released a large number of war criminals, turning Japan into a military base for American aggression in the Far East. We will never tolerate this. We will accuse the Japanese invaders of their bloody crimes to the world!"

The meeting ended in angry slogans. All the speeches at the meeting were recorded, and all the evidence was photographed and made into a movie. One hundred and twenty-six peasants who witnessed the Japanese invaders' crimes issued "certificates of testimony."

    湖北省黄陂县刘店乡农民举行大会
    控诉日寇在该地屠杀我四千余同胞的罪行
    【新华社汉口七日电】湖北省黄陂县刘店乡农民一千多人，在“七七”抗日战争十五周年纪念日的前夕，举行了控诉日寇屠杀罪行大会，要求严惩日本战犯，反对美国复活日本军国主义。参加大会的还有武汉市各民主党派、工商业联合会筹备委员会、基督教团体和佛教团体的代表。刘店乡附近各乡的农民也纷纷赶来控诉他们身受的日寇罪行。
    刘店乡的一干山下，是最近发现的日本法西斯侵略我国时杀害我国人民的大屠杀场之一（该地在武汉市东北二十里）。从日寇侵占武汉时起到投降时止，七年中，日寇在这里屠杀的中国人民在四千人以上，其中大都是共产党员、新四军战士、爱国志士、工人、农民及其他劳动人民。
    开会前，农民们怀着沉痛的心情在这个大屠杀场上进行了挖掘尸骨的工作。日寇每次杀人的前一天总是带着被害的人到这里强迫他们把沟挖好，第二天就把他们带到沟边杀死埋在沟里。目前，已经发现的沟有六十多条。在短短的三小时内，农民从十六条沟中挖出来的尸骨就有八百三十一具。有的尸骨上，还绑着绳子，从没烂尽的衣服上隐隐还可看出大块的血迹。除尸骨以外，还挖出许多酒瓶，这些酒瓶是日寇杀人前喝酒丢弃下来的。
    大会会场就设在当年日寇行凶的杀人场上。目睹日寇在该地进行大规模屠杀的农民周茂阶、杜松山、杜启望、管德世和受害苦主彭云山、张福荣等，都在会上愤怒控诉。他们说：日寇每次杀人，都在杀人沟周围布岗放哨，等汽车把捆绑着的被害者载到杀人场后，看押的日寇就用白布把他们的眼睛蒙住，然后由喝醉了酒的刽子手一个个把他们引到沟前，沿沟站成一排。刽子手们杀害我们的同胞时，都是先在颈上砍一刀，然后把被害者的身子踢到沟里，杀完后即对空鸣枪，呼啸而去。周茂阶说：一九三九年二月，他亲眼看到日寇正在杀人时，一个二十多岁的青年呼喊着：“共产党万岁！”从杀人沟边跑了出来，不幸被草绊倒，三个日寇赶上把他刺死了。第二次他看到日寇从中午十二时，一直杀到晚上上灯才走。他看到刽子手们佩带着白底黑“警”字的袖章，这是日寇武汉市警备队的标记。他说：“记住！杀人的就是这些狗强盗，我们要坚决向这些人索还血债！”杜启望看到过四次，被杀的达一百多人，其中一次是在夜里，一个日寇就杀了十几个人。管德世在一九四二年六月看到一个十几岁的孩子在死前愤怒高呼：“中国人决不要替日本鬼子做工！”管德世说：“旧仇未报，美帝国主义又在复活日本军国主义，我们决不容许它再来杀害我们，我们坚决要求严惩战犯，替已死的同胞报仇！”七十二岁的老农民彭云山说：“我仅有一个儿子被日本鬼子惨杀了，害得我十几年无依无靠，我们一定要为死难的同胞报仇！”
    武汉市各界代表也相继在会上发言，一致控诉日寇暴行。他们说：站起来的中国人民，在毛主席、中国共产党领导下，一定要为死难同胞报仇。我们有信心，有决心打败美国复活日本军国主义的侵略阴谋，保卫世界和平。
    最后，武汉市人民检察署副检察长吴杰发言，他说：“现在日本法西斯在中国所犯罪行的血渍未干，而美帝国主义居然宣布单独对日“和约”生效，并大批释放战犯，把日本变为美国侵略远东的军事基地。我们决不能容忍，我们要向全世界控诉日寇的血腥罪行！”
    会议在愤怒的口号声中结束。会上的全部发言均经录音，所有罪证均经拍照并摄成电影。亲眼看见日寇这一罪行的农民一百二十六人发表了“见证书”。
