    Labor Model Yue Songshan's Letter
    Exposes Serious Bureaucracy in Administrative Leadership

    To the Editor: The workers of our Chongqing No. 101 Factory urgently need a solution to the housing problem. Many workers in the factory have no housing. In the factory, 197 families live in caves, and some live very far away, having to travel more than ten miles to work every day, which leaves them exhausted. In the past, the government allocated over 10 billion yuan to our factory to build dormitories, but the administration only built some beautiful brick and tile Western-style houses, which can only accommodate just over 200 families, and the rent for these Western-style houses is tens of thousands of yuan per month, which many people cannot afford. If this money were used to build ordinary adobe bungalows, it could accommodate three times as many workers. In addition, many workshops in our factory require workers to shower after work. Since the resumption of production in 1950, we have been requesting a solution to the bathhouse problem. The riveters in the workshop are willing to provide voluntary labor and use waste materials to build a bathhouse. However, Deputy Director Zhang said it needed unified planning, and it still hasn't been resolved. The toilet problem has also not been resolved. Now the workers are launching a patriotic health campaign, but the workers' chamber pots have no designated place to be emptied, which is terrible.

    The administration also does not pay enough attention to rationalization proposals. During this anti-bureaucracy movement, it was found that more than 400 suggestions had been suppressed for a long time, and some very valuable suggestions were thrown into the wastepaper basket. The administration and the trade union are wholeheartedly engaged in "central movements" and say they cannot spare time to promote advanced experiences. They do the worst job of cultivating advanced groups and summarizing their experiences. If it weren't for the higher authorities wanting to summarize, they wouldn't care much. For example, this time the iron and steel trade union is holding a labor model conference, and the administration and trade union don't even know who created some advanced experiences and operational methods.

    劳动模范岳松山来信
    揭发行政领导上的严重官僚主义
    编辑同志：我们重庆一○一厂工人目前极需解决宿舍问题，全厂有很多人没有住房，在厂内有一百九十七家人住岩洞，有些人住得很远，每天要从十多里以外跑来上班，累得精疲力竭。过去，政府曾拨给我们厂一百多亿元修宿舍，但行政方面却只修些漂亮的砖瓦洋房，只能容纳二百多家人，而且洋房每月要好几万元房金，很多人都住不起。如果把这笔款修成普通的夹壁平房，就可以多容纳三倍的工人。另外，我们厂里不少车间的工人都是在下班后需要洗澡的，一九五○年恢复生产以来，我们就提出要求解决澡塘问题。铆工车间的工人愿意义务劳动，用废材料来修个洗澡塘。而张副厂长说要统一布置，直到现在还没解决。厕所问题也没解决。现在工人们正展开爱国卫生运动，但是工人们的马桶没有一定的倒处，这是多么糟糕。
    行政方面对合理化建议也很不重视。在这次反官僚主义运动中，查出有四百多件建议被压下来很久，有些很有价值的建议被丢进了字纸篓里。行政和工会，都专心一意地在搞“中心运动”，对于推广先进经验，他们说顾不上来。对先进小组的培养和总结他们的经验，做得最差。如果不是上级要总结，他们是不大管的。比如这次钢铁工会要开劳动模范会议，有的先进经验和操作法，行政和工会方面还不知道是谁创造的。
