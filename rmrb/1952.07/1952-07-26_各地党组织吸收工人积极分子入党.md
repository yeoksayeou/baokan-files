    Party Organizations in Various Localities Recruit Outstanding Workers into the Party

    During the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, in addition to the original activists among industrial workers in various localities being tested and tempered once again, a batch of new activists also emerged. These activists, having gone through the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic production increase competition movement, especially after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, have improved their class consciousness and are more convinced of the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party, and have applied to join the Communist Party one after another.

    These outstanding non-Party activists all possess a high degree of class consciousness. They not only strive to study the eight conditions of a Communist Party member but also devote themselves to the national construction cause with a selfless working spirit, striving to meet the eight conditions of a Party member. For example, nine activists in the Taiyuan Steel Plant who applied to join the Party voluntarily participated in the rush repair work of No. 1 open-hearth furnace. Among them, Yu Dehai bravely crawled into the furnace at a temperature of 300 degrees Celsius to retrieve a wooden ring, which enabled the rush repair work to be completed one day ahead of schedule, saving the country 300 million yuan. Du Yunlong, a model worker at the Dahua Textile Factory in Xi'an, promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, increased production, and created a new record since the establishment of the factory.

    The Party committees of various factories and mines have always maintained a positive and enthusiastic attitude towards the applications of these outstanding elements to join the Party. Now, Party committees in various localities have formulated plans for receiving new Party members, and according to their plans, they received a batch of new Party members before "July 1st." For example, the Shanghai Workers' Political School received 385 outstanding elements into the Party; the grass-roots organizations of the Tianjin Enterprise Party Committee received 144 outstanding workers and staff members into the Party. Other cities such as Beijing, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Qingdao, Jinan, Harbin, Fushun, and Anshan have also recruited a batch of new Party members.

    In the work of receiving new Party members, all localities have adopted an active and cautious approach in accordance with the Party Constitution, carrying out the work in a prepared, planned, and led manner, thereby maintaining the purity and seriousness of the Party. First of all, Party committees in various localities have universally carried out a series of propaganda and education work among the workers. In the five cities of Northeast China, including Shenyang, 460,000 workers have received education on communism and the Communist Party; Anshan Iron and Steel Company has run training courses for more than 9,000 worker activists after the "Three-Anti" movement, educating them on the eight conditions of a Party member; the vast majority of the 100,000 industrial workers in Beijing have received education on communism and the Communist Party. In order to educate and cultivate these activists, responsible comrades of Party committees in various localities have taken on the task of lecturing. Members of district committees, factory Party committees, and administrative responsible cadres in Beijing have all served as part-time Party class teachers. Various localities have also selected outstanding Party members to serve as Party organizers, specializing in the work of receiving new Party members. For example, Beijing has selected more than 320 organizers from among the responsible cadres of district committees and factories; the Northeast has equipped full-time organizers in various factories and mines. In order to enable these organizers to do their work well, Party committees in various localities have organized them to study the Party Constitution and the central government's instructions on developing the Party's work. In addition, Party committees in various localities have assigned Party members to contact activists, regularly understand their ideological situation, and help them to progress. Party organizations in various localities also frequently invite non-Party activists to participate in Party meetings to raise their class consciousness. Then, when these activists have improved their consciousness and actively apply to join the Party, they send special personnel to talk to those applying to join the Party, examine that they have indeed met the conditions of a Communist Party member, and then submit it to the branch general meeting for discussion and approval to receive them as Party members, and submit it to the higher-level Party committee for approval.

    Through in-depth education, repeated review and testing, and strict implementation of the procedures for joining the Party, the Party members developed in various localities are generally the most outstanding, most conscious, and most supported figures among the working masses; they are all outstanding members of the Communist Youth League, trade union members, and labor models. For example, among the 22 new Party members received by the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, nine are labor models. Among the 96 new Party members received in Xi'an, 39 are members of the Communist Youth League, 59 are grassroots cadres of the League and trade unions, and 30 of them have been rated as models.

    各地党组织吸收工人积极分子入党
    在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动中，除了各地产业工人中的原有的积极分子又一次受到了考验和锻炼以外，同时涌现了一批新的积极分子。这些积极分子经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国增产竞赛运动，特别是经过了“三反” “五反”运动，提高了阶级觉悟，更加相信中国共产党的伟大、光荣和正确，纷纷要求加入共产党。
    这些优秀的非党积极分子，都具有高度的阶级觉悟。他们不但努力学习共产党员标准的八项条件，并且以忘我的工作精神，从事国家建设事业，为争取达到党员标准的八项条件而奋斗。如太原炼钢厂有九名要求入党的积极分子，自动参加了抢修一号平炉的工作。其中的于德海英勇地钻进了三百度高温的火炉里抢出木圈，使抢修工作提早一天完成，为国家节省了三亿元。西安市大华纱厂模范工人杜云龙，推广了郝建秀工作法，提高了产量，创造了建厂以来的新纪录。
    各厂矿党委对待这些优秀分子的入党要求，一向抱着积极热情的态度。现在，各地党委都订出了接收新党员的计划，并根据自己的计划，在“七一”前夕接收了一批新党员。如上海市工人政治学校，即接收了三百八十五名优秀分子入党；天津市企业党委的基层组织，接收了一百四十四名优秀工人和职员入党。其他如北京、太原、唐山、青岛、济南、哈尔滨、抚顺、鞍山等市，也都吸收了一批新党员。
    各地在接收新党员的工作中，均按党章规定，采用了积极而慎重的方针，有准备、有计划、有领导地进行工作，因而保持了党的纯洁性和严肃性。首先各地党委均在工人中普遍地进行了一系列的宣传教育工作。在东北沈阳等五个城市中，已有四十六万工人受过关于共产主义和共产党的教育；鞍山市“三反”后开办了有九千余名工人积极分子参加的训练班，进行了党员标准的八项条件的教育；北京市的十万产业工人，绝大部分受过了关于共产主义和共产党的教育。为了教育和培养这些积极分子，各地党委的负责同志担任了讲课工作，北京市各区委委员、各工厂党委委员及行政负责干部都兼任党课教员。各地也都选拔了优秀的党员做为党的组织员，专门进行接收新党员的工作。如北京市在各区委、各厂矿负责干部中共选拔了组织员三百二十余名；东北在各厂矿中配备了专职的组织员。为了使这些组织员作好自己的工作，各地党委组织他们学习了党章及中央关于发展党的工作的指示。此外各地党委均分配党员联系积极分子，经常了解他们的思想情况，帮助他们进步。各地党组织并经常邀请非党积极分子参加党的会议，提高他们的阶级觉悟，然后在这些积极分子觉悟提高、积极申请入党时，即派专人和申请入党的人谈话，审查其确已具备共产党员条件后，提交支部大会讨论通过接收其为党员，并呈请上级党委批准。
    经过深入的教育，反复地审查和考验，并严格地执行了入党手续，各地所发展的党员一般地都是工人群众中最优秀、最有觉悟、最为群众所拥护的人物，他们都是优秀的青年团员、工会会员、劳动模范。如上海电机厂接收的二十二名新党员，其中有九名劳动模范。西安市接收的九十六名新党员中，三十九人是青年团员，五十九人是团和工会的基层干部，其中有三十人已被评为模范。
