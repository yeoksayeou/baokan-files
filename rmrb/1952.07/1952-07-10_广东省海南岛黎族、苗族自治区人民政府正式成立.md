Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, July 8th: The People's Government of the Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, was officially established on July 1st. On the same day in Buyou City, Ledong County, where the Autonomous Region People's Government is located, a grand rally was held to celebrate the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government and the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Representatives of the Li and Miao peoples and Li and Miao people within forty li of the surrounding area wore their national costumes, beat drums and sounded horns, and celebrated wildly in the rain. All government members took a solemn oath at the meeting, expressing their sincere support for the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and to unite closely with fraternal ethnic groups to develop political, economic, cultural, and educational construction. Wang Guoxing, Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said in his speech: "The establishment of the People's Government of the Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Hainan is a great event that our Li and Miao people will never forget, and a great victory for the ethnic policies of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government!"

The People's Government of the Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Hainan directly governs the five counties of Ledong, Baisha, Baoting, Qiongzhong, and Dongfang, and is a local government equivalent to a special commissioner's office. The 270,000 Li and Miao people in the area resolutely supported the revolution before liberation and fully supported the local people's army in its continuous struggle against the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the two years since liberation, the necessary preparations for establishing the autonomous region have been completed.
