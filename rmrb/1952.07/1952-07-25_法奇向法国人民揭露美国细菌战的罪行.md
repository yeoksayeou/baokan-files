Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 24th: A delayed dispatch from Paris: Fache, President of the French Peace Council, recently returned from a visit to China and Korea, and on July 11th gave a report to thousands of Parisian workers, scientists, doctors and intellectuals, condemning the American crimes of germ warfare against the people of China and Korea. The report was presided over by Dr. Piga, and on the stage were French Communist Party Central Committee member Casanova, world-renowned mathematician Professor Hadamard, and other prominent French figures.

Fache presented a large amount of evidence he had collected, including hundreds of documents, dozens of eyewitness reports, and recordings of conversations with American Air Force prisoner of war Quinn, as well as confessions from other prisoners of war, Inak and captured soldier Blanc. He presented scientific evidence, which was explained by experts. All of these documents and evidence clearly proved the American crimes of germ warfare to the audience. Fache expressed his warm respect for the suffering Korean people. He said: The Korean people, when encountering difficulties beyond description, did not yield, but instead defeated the well-equipped enemy army. Fache concluded by calling on the people to understand the nature of the Korean War and take immediate action to stop it.

The audience applauded thunderously, expressing their enthusiastic support for Fache's call.

    法奇向法国人民揭露美国细菌战的罪行
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】巴黎迟到消息：最近访问中国和朝鲜回来的法国和平理事会主席法奇在七月十一日向数千巴黎工人、科学家、医生和知识分子作报告，谴责美国对中朝两国人民进行细菌战的罪行。报告会由科学博士皮加主持，在主席台上的有法国共产党中央委员卡桑诺伐、世界闻名的数学家哈达马教授和法国其他著名人士。
    法奇提出了他所收集的大量证据，其中包括数百个文件、几十件目击者的报告以及美国空军战俘奎恩的谈话录音，另一战俘伊纳克和被俘士兵勃朗的供词。他提出的科学证据并有专家进行解释。所有这些文件和证据都向听众们清楚地证明了美国进行细菌战的罪行。法奇对受难的朝鲜人民表示热烈的敬意。他说：朝鲜人民在遭遇到非言语所能形容的困难的时候，并没有屈服，反而使装备齐全的敌军遭到了失败。法奇最后号召：人民必须了解朝鲜战争的性质，并立即采取行动来加以制止。
    听众掌声雷动，对法奇的号召表示热烈支持。
