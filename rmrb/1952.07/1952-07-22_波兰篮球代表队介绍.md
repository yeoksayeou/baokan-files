Introduction to the Polish Basketball Team

The Polish basketball team, invited to our country, consists of thirty-five people. The leader is Kozochnik Boguslav, Deputy Minister of Health of the Polish Republic. The men's team coach is Rudechowiak Florian, and the women's team coach is Glechowiak Florian. Among them are fifteen male players and thirteen female players. They are all amateur athletes from cities such as Warsaw, Lodz, and Poznan. The captain of the men's team is Zieliński Józef, and the captain of the women's team is Kameska-Kordek Maria. The players include students, porcelain workers, railway workers, and construction engineers. They are not only Poland's most outstanding athletes, but also excellent workers in various production, work, and study positions. The women's team coach, Glechowiak Florian, is a Meritorious Sportsman of Poland. The women's team captain, Kameska-Kordek Maria, and outstanding female players Gruszczyńska Romealda and Rogowska Stefania are all Poland's most famous athletes.

Polish people's sports have been greatly developed under the care and leadership of the United Workers' Party and the government, and with the help of advanced Soviet sports experience. The young Polish basketball team has only been systematically practicing for about two years, and has already made significant progress. They have not only developed strong physiques, skilled techniques, and excellent moral character, but also achieved good results in many international competitions. In 1951, the Polish men's basketball team participated in the 11th World Student Summer Games held in Berlin, simultaneously with the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival, defeating countries such as the United Kingdom and winning fifth place. The women's basketball team participated in the two European Women's Basketball Championships held in Budapest in 1950 and in Moscow this May, successively defeating countries such as Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy. In 1950, during the competition in Budapest, the Polish women's basketball players were still behind France and Italy. This May, during the competition in Moscow, they had already defeated them, winning fifth place.

The members of the Polish basketball team are visiting our country with great excitement. Through this visit, the friendship between the people and athletes of China and Poland will be further strengthened. (Xinhua News Agency)
