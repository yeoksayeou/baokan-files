    Soviet Children's Life and Teacher's Life
    Lü Jingxian, Teacher of Jingwei Elementary School, Harbin

    Last summer, I participated in the Young Pioneer Instructors Delegation selected by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to study the working experience of the Young Pioneers in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, we visited many schools, summer camps, children's palaces, factories, and collective farms. I want to write down what I saw and felt and dedicate it to comrades who are engaged in education work like me.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin all attach great importance to people's education and the cultivation of the younger generation. In 1951, the Soviet government allocated 59 billion rubles to national education, accounting for more than one-eighth of the national budget. The Soviet Union has more than 200,000 schools and 38 million students. The seven-year school has become the basic school for implementing universal education, so no illiterates can be found anywhere in the Soviet Union. In addition, children's palaces, young technicians' stations, young natural science stations, children's theaters, children's parks, children's bookstores, and children's publishing bureaus are also specially established for children.
    The Soviet school, family, society, and Young Pioneer organization closely cooperate to conduct regular communist education for the younger generation. The equipment in Soviet schools is very complete. We visited many ten-year and seven-year schools. The tall school buildings are surrounded by wide playgrounds planted with lush green trees. Various wall newspapers are hung on the walls of the spacious and bright corridors. The school has a library, medical room, auditorium, and various specialized classrooms. Each specialized classroom is equipped with teaching aids such as wall charts, instruments, specimens, and projectors. Teachers often use film screenings for lectures.
    Many regions in the Soviet Union have children's palaces. For example, in the Zhdanov Children's Palace in Leningrad, there are more than 300 staff members serving the children, and more than 10,000 children participate in activities. There are countless entertainment and learning groups here, divided into seven major departments: natural sciences, social work, industrial technology, agricultural gardening, sports, recreation, literature, and art. After class, any child can come to the palace to participate in their favorite entertainment activities and learning.
    Many cities have children's parks. In the children's park in Batumi, children wearing naval uniforms drive motorboats and sail on a beautiful green lake. In the children's park in Tbilisi, children drive small trains that can accommodate sixty or seventy people and travel around the park. Its equipment and management are the same as ordinary railways. From the railway director to the train conductor, they are all taken care of by children in their teens. The state has specially set up children's trains and steamships for these children in school who love to study transportation technology, so that they can learn and entertain after class.
    The Moscow Children's Book House is located in a magnificent building. It is a joint institution of a library, research institute, and museum, dedicated to serving children and those who write for children. Children often come here after class to quietly read their favorite books. The library here has more than 60,000 children's books. Many items and rare versions, as well as newspapers and magazines, are displayed in the museum. In the research room, there are many experts who specialize in studying children's books, children's literature history, and theory.
    The Soviet state gives great care to children's literature, music, drama, and film. There are more than 39,000 children's publishing houses in the Soviet Union, which have published 1.06 billion children's books. There are 250 children's literature writers who specialize in writing for children. There are 137 children's theaters specially set up for children, with nearly 8 million audiences each year. Among the famous Soviet writers, such as Marshak and Kataev, have written a lot for young people. In the theater, some dramas loved by children are often performed.
    The Soviet government is very concerned about children's summer life, and has set up many summer camps in and out of the city for them everywhere. Every child can spend a happy life in the summer camp.
    The Soviet people also care for children with great enthusiasm. In the children's park in Batumi, members of the Communist Youth League from local factories, agencies, and schools participated in voluntary labor and built two wide and beautiful stadiums for the children as gifts to the Young Pioneers. In the magnificent Zhdanov Children's Palace, many brilliant facilities were donated by the working people of Leningrad. At an election meeting of the Young Pioneers of a school in Moscow, workers from nearby factories rushed to participate. They brought many gifts such as basketballs and footballs to the children and congratulated them on the start of the new school year.
    Technicians and engineers in factories near the school often go to schools, children's palaces, and summer camps in their spare time to help guide children's various extracurricular science and technology group activities, and give the machine, ship, and airplane models they made to children's palaces and schools as teaching aids. Members of the collective farm also sent seeds, fruits, and collected specimens of plants to the school for children to study and research. How happy Soviet children are!
    The teachers who are cared for by the Soviet people are also happy. They are all carrying out the noble task of cultivating active and educated builders of communist society. Every Soviet teacher we came into contact with was so loyal, optimistic, and full of pride in their career. A female teacher from No. 151 School in Kiev once told us happily: "I have unparalleled pride because I am a teacher. I am cultivating the most useful talents for the country's communist construction." Mr. Pavlenko, the old principal of No. 315 Boys' School in Moscow, who is over 60 years old, has been working for more than 40 years. He wears the Order of Lenin on his chest. The government gives him generous wages and pension subsidies every year. He could have left school to recuperate, but he told us: "If I were to leave school for a day, it would be an incredible thing for me!" Many teachers have dedicated their 30 to 40 years of energy, and they are respectfully called "Meritorious Teachers" by the Soviet people. But no one wants to leave school to recuperate. They believe that when the people of the whole country are actively building a communist motherland, how can a person who can still continue to work for the happiness of the motherland be idle at home? Soviet teachers are so loving their motherland and their career!
    The Soviet government attaches great importance to the valuable and responsible labor of teachers. Teachers who have been teaching for ten or fifteen years are awarded medals; those who have been teaching for twenty years are awarded勋章 (orders); and outstanding teachers and teachers with more than thirty years of service are awarded the highest勋章 (order) - the Order of Lenin. In 1948 and 1949, the Soviet government awarded 100,000 medals to teachers.
    "Honorary Teacher" is a title awarded by the Supreme Soviet of the Union Republic to active members in education. There are more than 1,000 honorary teachers in Russia. All honorary teachers, just like teachers who have obtained a degree, have their wages increased by 15% to 20%.
    The treatment given to teachers by the Soviet government increases with the increase of their seniority. A five-year regular salary increase system was implemented starting from the 1927-1928 academic year: a 10% increase in the original salary for five years of work, and a 20% increase for ten years of work. Teachers with 25 years of service, whether they have retired or not, receive a pension from the government every month equal to 40% of their original salary, and are provided with housing and utilities. Rural teachers enjoy other rights in addition to their salaries, such as free housing and a few small pieces of land that can be used freely. If they want a house, they are given a piece of land near the school and building materials. All construction costs can be solved by long-term loans from the government. The Soviet Union has lowered the prices of daily necessities five times in the post-war years, and teachers' wages have been raised twice in recent years. From this, it can be clearly understood to what extent the living standards of Soviet teachers have been raised. In the Soviet Union, the remuneration of a teacher is about the same as that of engineering and technical personnel. Soviet teachers have two months of vacation each year. At the beginning of the summer vacation, they can pre-receive eight weeks of wages as expenses for the vacation. The teachers' union has set up many sanatoriums and recuperation centers for teachers in Crimea, the Caucasus, and other scenic areas. During the summer vacation, thousands of teachers recuperate in sanatoriums and recuperation centers, or use the summer vacation to travel around. Teachers' children spend happy summer vacations in summer camps set up by the teachers' union.
    Many cities in the Soviet Union have established "Teachers' Homes," teachers' clubs, and other entertainment and rest places for teachers. For example, the "Teachers' Home" in Moscow is located in the center of the city. It is beautiful and spacious, and has two large halls that can accommodate hundreds of people for gatherings and concerts. Here, there are often get-together parties for teachers and actors, scientists, and writers. There are also various amateur art activity groups and libraries. This is a place for teachers' social and political activities and amateur cultural recreation.
    In the Soviet Union, normal schools and normal colleges in various places have night school departments and correspondence departments, so that in-service teachers have the opportunity to improve their political and professional levels. Whether in cities or villages, teachers can go to night school departments or correspondence departments to study. After they have completed all the courses, they can participate in national examinations and obtain graduation certificates, and enjoy the same rights as graduates of regular normal schools and normal colleges. In large cities, there are also teacher training colleges to provide teachers with opportunities for further study.
    The Soviet Socialist state has opened up a broad path for the development of teachers. The best teachers are elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, or are elected as representatives of the Soviet of the Union Republic. Soviet teachers have become lovers of the broad Soviet people.
    The Soviet Union's today is our beautiful tomorrow, our goal and model for advancement. When we realize that the prospect of people's education is so bright and beautiful, comrades, can we not be excited? Can we not love our career?
    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the great leaders Lenin and Comrade Stalin, have established today's beautiful life after more than 30 years of hard work. We still have a difficult road to go to realize this glorious prospect. Let us learn from the Soviet Union's revolutionary and construction experience and use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to overcome all the difficulties on the road ahead. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the beautiful prospect we yearn for will surely be realized!

    苏联的儿童生活和教师生活
    哈尔滨市经纬小学教师  吕敬先
    去年夏天，我参加中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会选派的辅导员代表队，到苏联学习少年先锋队的工作经验。在苏联，我们参观过许多学校、夏令营、儿童宫、工厂和集体农庄。我要把我的所见所感写出来，献给和我同样从事教育工作的同志们。
    苏联共产党（布）、苏联政府和斯大林同志，对于人民教育、对于少年一代的培养，都是非常重视的。一九五一年苏联政府给国民教育拨款五百九十亿卢布，占国家预算的八分之一以上。苏联有二十多万座学校和三千八百万名学生。七年制学校已成为实施基本的普及教育的学校，因此在苏联的任何地方都找不出文盲来。此外，还给少年儿童们专门设立了儿童宫、少年技术站、少年自然科学站、儿童剧院、儿童公园、儿童书院、儿童出版局等。
    苏联的学校、家庭、社会和少年先锋队的组织，紧密地配合在一起，向少年一代进行着经常的共产主义教育。苏联学校的设备非常完善。我们参观了许多十年制和七年制的学校，高大的校舍周围的宽阔的操场上，种植着葱绿的树木；宽敞明亮的走廊的两壁上，悬挂着各种壁报。校内设有图书馆、医疗室、大礼堂以及各种专科教室，每个专科教室里都放置着挂图、仪器、标本、电影机等教具，教师们常常利用电影的放映进行讲课。
    苏联很多地区都设有儿童宫。比如在列宁格勒的日丹诺夫儿童宫里，就有三百多名工作人员在为孩子们服务，有一万多名孩子参加活动。这里的娱乐和学习小组多至不可胜数，共分为自然科学、社会工作、工业技术、农业园艺、体育、游艺、文学和美术等七大部门。课后，任何儿童都可以来到宫里参加他所喜欢的娱乐活动和学习。
    许多城市里都设有儿童公园。在巴土敏的儿童公园里，小朋友们穿着海军的服装，驾驶着汽船，航行在美丽的碧绿的湖上。在梯比利斯的儿童公园里，小朋友们驾驶着能容纳六七十人的小型火车，环绕公园旅行。它的设备和管理都和普通铁路一样，从铁路局长到列车员都是由十几岁的孩子自己来担当。国家特别为了这些在学校里爱好学习交通技术的儿童，设立了儿童火车汽船以供他们在课后进行学习和娱乐之用。
    莫斯科的儿童书院，设在一所壮丽的大厦里。这是图书馆、研究所和博物馆的联合机构，是专给孩子们和给为孩子们写作的人服务的。小朋友们在课后常常来到这里，安静地阅读着他们所喜爱的书籍。在这里的图书馆里，藏有六万多册儿童图书。在博物馆里陈列着许多物品和稀有的版本以及报刊、杂志。在研究室里，有不少专家在专门研究儿童读物、儿童文学史和理论。
    苏维埃国家对于儿童文学、音乐、戏剧和电影，都给以极大的关怀。在苏联有三万九千多个儿童出版社，发行了十亿零六百万册儿童读物，有二百五十位儿童文学作家专为孩子们写作。有一百三十七所为儿童特设的儿童剧院，每年有将近八百万的观众。在苏维埃的著名作家中，如马尔沙克、卡达耶夫等曾为少年们写作了不少东西。在剧院里，常常出演一些为儿童所爱好的戏剧。
    苏联政府非常关怀儿童的暑期生活，到处为他们设立了许多城内和城外夏令营，每一个儿童都能够在夏令营里度着愉快的生活。
    苏联人民也以极大的热诚关怀着儿童。在巴土敏的儿童公园里，当地的工厂、机关、学校的共产主义青年团团员，参加义务劳动，为孩子们修建了两个宽阔、美丽的体育场，作为他们送给少年先锋队员的礼物。在壮丽的日丹诺夫儿童宫里，许多辉煌的设备，都是列宁格勒的劳动人民捐献的。在莫斯科市一个学校少年先锋队的某次选举会议上，附近工厂的工人都赶来参加。他们带来了篮球、足球等许多礼物送给孩子们，祝贺他们新学年的开始。
    学校附近的工厂里的技师、工程师，也在业余时常常到学校、儿童宫和夏令营里来帮助指导孩子们各种课外科学技术小组的活动，并把他们制作的机器、船舶和飞机模型，送给儿童宫和学校做为教具。集体农庄的庄员也把植物的种子、果实和采集的标本送给学校，供孩子们学习、研究。苏联儿童是多么幸福呵！
    为苏联人民所关心的教师们，也是幸福的，他们都在执行着崇高的任务——培养共产主义社会的积极的、有教养的建设者。我们所接触到的每个苏联教师，对于自己的事业，都是那么忠诚、乐观、充满了自豪感。基辅城第一百五十一校的一位女教师曾经愉快地告诉我们：“我有着无比的骄傲，因为我是个教师，我在为国家培养共产主义建设最有用的人才。”莫斯科市第三百一十五男校有一位六十多岁的老校长巴甫林科，已经工作四十多年了，他的胸前佩带着列宁勋章。政府每年给他优厚的工资和养老补助金。他本可以离开学校去休养了，但是他告诉我们：“如果让我离开学校一天，这对于我将是一件不可思议的事！”有很多教师都贡献了自己三四十年的精力，他们被苏联人民尊称为“功勋教师”。可是谁也不肯离开学校去休养，他们认为：当全国人民正在积极建设共产主义祖国的时候，一个仍然能继续为祖国的幸福而工作的人，如何能闲在家里？苏联教师，就是那样地热爱祖国、热爱自己的事业！
    苏联政府对于教师们珍贵而负责的劳动是非常重视的。对教学十年或十五年的教师授以奖章；对教学二十年的授以勋章；对优秀教师和服务三十年以上的教师，发给最高勋章——列宁勋章。苏联政府在一九四八和一九四九年两年中，发给教师们十万个奖章。
    “荣誉教师”是加盟共和国最高苏维埃赐给那些教育工作中积极分子的称号。俄罗斯的荣誉教师就有一千多个。一切荣誉教师，正像取得学位的教师一样，增加工资百分之十五到二十。
    苏联政府给予教师的待遇是随着本人工龄的增长而提高的。从一九二七到一九二八这一学年开始实行五年定期加薪制：工作五年增加原工资百分之十，工作十年增加百分之二十。有服务二十五年资历的教师，不论他已否退休，每个月都由政府发给他占原工资百分之四十的养老金，并有住宅和水电的供给。农村教师除掉工资外，还享有其他权利，例如：享受免费的住宅与几小块可以自由使用的土地，假如他们想要一栋房屋，那么就在学校附近给他一块土地以及建筑材料。一切建筑费用，可由政府方面的长期贷款来解决。苏联在战后的年代里曾五次降低日用品的价格，而教师的工资在最近几年又提高了两次。由此就可以明了，苏联教师的生活水平已经提高到怎样的程度了。在苏联，一个教师的劳动报酬和工程技术人员比较起来是相差不多的。苏联教师每年都有两个月的休假，暑假一开始他们就可预先支领八个星期的工资，作为假期内的用费。教师工会在克里米亚、高加索和其他风景优美地区为教师们设立了许多疗养所和休养所。在暑期中有成千成万的教师在疗养所和休养所休养，或利用暑期到各地去旅行。教师的孩子则到教师工会设立的夏令营中去度过快乐的暑期。
    在苏联的许多城市里为教师们设立了“教师之家”、教师俱乐部和其他娱乐、休息场所。例如：莫斯科市的“教师之家”是设在城市的中心，美丽而宽大，有能够容数百人集会和开音乐会的两个大会场。在这里常常举行教师和演员、科学家、作家的联欢会。还设有各种业余艺术活动小组和图书馆。这是教师的社会政治活动和业余文化休息的场所。
    在苏联，各地师范专修学院和师范学院都设有夜校部和函授部，使在职教师们都有机会来提高自己的政治和业务水平。不论在城市或乡村里，教师们都可以到夜校部或函授部进行学习，等他们修满了全部课程，就可参加国家考试，并可得到毕业证书，与正规师范专修学院和师范学院毕业生享有同等权利。在大城市里，还设有教师进修学院，使教师们获得深造的机会。
    苏维埃社会主义国家给教师开辟了一条广阔的发展道路，最优秀的教师都被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，或被选入加盟共和国苏维埃代表。苏联教师已成为广大的苏联人民的爱戴者。
    苏联的今天就是我们美好的明天，是我们的奋斗目标和前进的榜样。当我们意识到人民教育事业的远景是那样光辉美丽时，同志们，我们能够不兴奋吗？能够不热爱我们的事业吗？
    苏联人民在伟大的领袖列宁、斯大林同志的领导下，经过三十多年的辛勤劳动，才建立起今天的美好的生活。我们要实现这个光辉的远景，还要走过一段艰苦的路程。让我们好好学习苏联的革命和建设的经验，用革命精神和革命办法来克服前进道路上的一切困难吧。我们深信，在我们伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我们所向往着的那个美好的远景一定会实现！
