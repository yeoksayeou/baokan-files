    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The "Three-Anti" Movement at and above the county level in North China has concluded victoriously. In order to consolidate the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement, effectively prevent corruption, waste, and bureaucratic errors, plug all loopholes, and strengthen the connection between Party organizations, People's Governments, and the broad masses at all levels, as well as between superiors and subordinates within organizations, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has specifically stipulated the following five important systems, instructing Party committees, the military, People's Governments, and Party groups of mass organizations at all levels, as well as Party committees of all schools, factories, mines, and enterprises, to comply with and implement them:
    I. Enrich democratic life within the Party, improve democratic systems within the Party, and strengthen the connection between leading organs and all Party members and the broad masses. To this end, it is determined that provincial, municipal, prefectural, and county Party committees, as well as district Party committees that have undergone the "Three-Anti" Movement, should, in accordance with the Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, convene Party congresses or representative conferences, where Party committees will report on their work to the congresses or representative conferences, summarize the experiences of the "Three-Anti" Movement, and accept the review and criticism of the congress; put forward future work tasks and make resolutions; and elect Party leading organs at all levels at the Party congresses. Party, government, military, mass organizations, schools, and all factories, mines, and enterprises should conduct a democratic review at least once a year, and regularly (e.g., quarterly) convene meetings of subordinate cadres or Party members or other appropriate meetings at each level to listen to the opinions of subordinates and improve leadership. Improve Party work in organizations, regularly re-elect branch committees and Party committees of organizations; all Party member cadres must live a strict organizational life, accept the tasks assigned by the Party, establish and improve the Party Day system, and regularly conduct criticism and self-criticism.
    II. Establish a political work system in all economic departments to effectively change the weak political and ideological leadership and the chaotic personnel system in economic departments. To this end, it is recommended that trade, industrial, and financial departments and banks and cooperative organizations at the provincial and municipal levels all add full-time deputy directors (bureaus), deputy bank presidents, and deputy directors to manage the political education and personnel work of their respective systems; larger trading companies, specialized companies, and state-owned or public factories, mines, and farms should also add deputy managers, deputy factory (farm) directors as much as possible to manage the above-mentioned work. The deputy director (bureau), deputy bank president, and deputy director who are fully responsible for this work at the upper level of the same system have the right to directly inspect, supervise, and guide similar work in subordinate factories, mines, enterprises, and farms. Party committees and Party groups of governments or Party committees of organizations at the same level should regularly inspect the political and ideological education work, Party work, and personnel work of the above-mentioned departments and must not let them go unattended.
    III. Establish a strict cadre management system. The appointment, deployment, promotion, reward, and punishment of all cadres must be handled uniformly by the organizational departments of Party committees and mass organizations at all levels and the personnel departments of government and cooperative organizations, strictly in accordance with established principles and procedures. No individual has the right to handle them independently, and violators shall be punished. Organizational and personnel departments should attach importance to this work and implement regular inspections in a planned and guided manner.
    IV. Establish and improve various daily work systems. All Party, government, and military organizations and mass organizations, schools, industrial and mining enterprises should, based on the experience and lessons of the "Three-Anti" Movement, and based on the principles of collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, improving work efficiency, and close ties with the masses, formulate basic work systems for each unit, which should include the work rules of each unit and division of labor and contact, duty, meeting with the masses, handling letters from the masses, inspection work, and other systems. Those who have already formulated them should inspect and improve them to make them perfect; those who have not yet formulated them should formulate them as soon as possible and should not be careless.
    V. Improve the financial system of organizations, strictly abide by the national financial system and financial discipline, and not embezzle or waste. Implement economic democracy, regularly publish accounts, and conduct regular inspections. Strictly follow reimbursement procedures, and leaders must not approve notes. All welfare benefits for staff members of relevant organizations should establish various mass organizations, such as food, recreation, family relief, health care, sanitation, and other committees, to strengthen management and fully realize mass inspection and supervision.

    为巩固“三反”运动的伟大成果
    中共中央华北局规定五项制度
    【新华社七日讯】华北区县级以上的“三反”运动已胜利结束。为了巩固“三反”运动的伟大成果，切实有效地杜绝贪污、浪费和官僚主义错误，堵塞一切漏洞，并密切各级党的组织、人民政府和广大群众之间以及机关内部上下级之间的联系，中共中央华北局特规定以下五项重要制度，指示各地各级党委、军队、人民政府和群众团体党组、以及各学校、工厂、矿山、企业党委一律遵照执行：
    一、充实党内的民主生活，健全党内的民主制度，密切领导机关和全体党员及广大群众之间的联系。为此，确定各省委、市委、地委、县委以及进行过“三反”运动的区委，应按照中国共产党党章和中共中央的指示，召开党的代表大会或代表会议，由党委向代表大会或代表会议报告工作，总结“三反”运动的经验，接受大会的审查批评；提出今后的工作任务，作出决议；并在党的代表大会上选举党的各级领导机关。党、政府、军队、群众团体、学校和一切工厂、矿山、企业，每年至少进行一次民主检查，并定期（例如一季）逐级召开所属干部会议或党员会议或其他适当会议，听取下级意见，改进领导。健全机关党的工作，定期改选支部委员会和机关党委会；所有党员干部都必须过严格的组织生活，接受党所分配的任务，建立与健全党日制度，经常进行批评与自我批评。
    二、建立各经济部门的政治工作制度，切实改变经济部门政治思想领导薄弱和人事制度紊乱的情况。为此，建议省、市级以上的贸易、工业、财政部门及银行、合作社机构一律增设专职的副厅长
    （局长）、副行长、副主任，管理所属系统的政治教育工作和人事工作；较大的贸易公司、各专业公司、国营或公营工厂、矿山、农场，亦应尽可能增设副经理、副厂（场）长，管理上述工作。同一系统上一级专任此项工作的副厅长（局长）、副行长、副主任，对下一级所属工厂、矿山、企业、农场中的同类工作有直接检查、督促与指导之权。同级党委和政府党组或机关党委会，对上述部门的政治思想教育工作、党的工作和人事工作，应定期进行检查，不能放任不管。
    三、建立严格的干部管理制度。所有干部的任用、调配、提拔、奖惩，必须一律经过各级党委、群众团体的组织部门和政府、合作社机构的人事部门，严格按照既定的原则及手续办理，任何个人均无权自行处理，违者应予论处。组织部门和人事部门应重视此项工作，有计划有领导地实行定期检查。
    四、建立与健全各种日常工作制度。所有党、政、军机关及群众团体、学校、工矿、企业部门，均应根据“三反”运动的经验教训，根据集体领导、分工负责、提高工作效率、紧密联系群众等项原则，制订各单位的基本工作制度，其中应包括各单位的工作简则和分工联系、值班、接见群众、处理群众来信，检查工作等项制度，已经制订者应检查改进，务求完备；尚未制订者应尽速制订，不可马虎。
    五、健全机关财务制度，严格遵守国家财政制度和财政纪律，不得挪用，严禁浪费。实行经济民主，定期公布账目，定期实行检查。严格报销手续，首长概不得批条子。凡有关机关工作人员的生活福利，均建立各种群众组织，如伙食、文娱、家属救济、保健、卫生等各种委员会，加强管理，充分实现群众性的检查与监督。
