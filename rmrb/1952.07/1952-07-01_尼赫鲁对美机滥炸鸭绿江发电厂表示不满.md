    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru has expressed opposition to the US aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Yalu River power plants during the Korean armistice talks, an attempt to expand the war and endanger world peace.

    Nehru said in the Indian Parliament's House of the People on the 26th: "I am sure that every member here dislikes this kind of thing, and everyone is against doing this kind of thing while seeking peace." On the 28th, he replied to a member's inquiry in the House of the People, saying that the Indian government was "uneasy" at the thought that "the future of the United Nations and the future of war and peace may be decided without proper consultation." Nehru pointed out that the bombing was carried out on power stations on the border between China and North Korea. "The Indian government earnestly hopes that this action will end and that the armistice will be realized," and that "any possible expansion of these military operations would endanger world peace."

    At the same time, several Indian newspapers also expressed disapproval of the US aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Yalu River power plants and peaceful facilities. The Madras "The Hindu" said on the 26th: "Those who wish to see the end of the Korean War cannot but regard the bombing of the Yalu River as an unnecessary act of provocation." The report pointed out that if, like a small group of Americans, one insisted that this bombing could force the Korean and Chinese sides to change their demands in the Panmunjom armistice talks, "that is underestimating the strength and tenacity of China and its ally, North Korea." The report also said, "Expanding the war will not be welcomed by the allies of the United States."

    The Bombay "Indian Express" said in a commentary on the 27th entitled "MacArthurism": "The large-scale air strikes by the Allies have put Britain or other allies in an embarrassing situation." The report believes that the unity of the US front "has therefore been threatened."

    尼赫鲁对美机滥炸鸭绿江发电厂表示不满
    【新华社三十日讯】据印度新闻处新德里消息，印度总理尼赫鲁对于美国飞机在朝鲜停战谈判期间滥炸鸭绿江发电厂企图扩大战争并危害世界和平的事件，表示反对。
    尼赫鲁二十六日在印度议会人民院中说：“我敢肯定，这里的每一个议员都不喜欢这种事，而且正当在谋求和平的时候做出这种事来，大家是反对的。”二十八日，他在人民院中答复议员的询问时又说：想到“联合国的前途以及战争与和平的前途，可能不经过正当的磋商，迳自被人决定”，这使印度政府颇为“不安”。尼赫鲁指出：轰炸是对中、朝两国边境的发电站进行的。“印度政府急切盼望这种行动终止，并盼望停战实现”，“这些军事行动的任何可能的扩大，都会危害世界和平。”
    同时印度若干报纸也对美国飞机滥炸鸭绿江发电厂和平设备一事，表示不赞成。马德拉斯“印度人报”二十六日说：“那些愿意看到朝鲜战事结束的人们，不能不认为轰炸鸭绿江是不必要的挑衅的行动。”该报指出：要是像有一小撮美国人那样，硬说这种轰炸能迫使朝中方面改变他们在板门店停战谈判中的主张，“那是低估了中国和它的盟国北朝鲜的力量和顽强性。”该报并说：“扩大战争将不为美国的盟国所欢迎。”
    孟买“印度快报”二十七日在以“麦克阿瑟主义”为题的评论中说：“盟国的大规模空袭已使英国或其他盟国处于狼狈不堪的境地。”该报认为美方阵线的团结“已经因此而受到威胁”。
