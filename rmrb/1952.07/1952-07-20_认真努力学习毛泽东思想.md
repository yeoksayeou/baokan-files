    Seriously and Diligently Study Mao Zedong Thought
    Zhang Pingkai
    Since the "Three-Anti" movement, many veteran comrades have paid attention to studying. Everyone says, "In the past, when reading 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' we couldn't see the problems, but now we realize that many problems were addressed by Chairman Mao a long time ago." Looking at the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume I, whether it is about organizational leadership, mass movements, political power construction, military command (military strategic and tactical thought), economic and financial policies, culture and education, united front, party building principles, or ideological education, all demonstrate a high degree of Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis and foresight. It should be admitted that before the "Three-Anti" movement, many party members, cadres, and even some responsible cadres, did not attach importance to the study of Mao Zedong Thought and had not seriously studied Chairman Mao's many important instructions that warned the entire party. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements exposed a large number of specific facts about the "three evils" and "five poisons," we looked back at the following words that Chairman Mao said in his article "Our Economic Policy" eighteen years ago, and our understanding became particularly profound: "Financial expenditure should be based on the principle of thrift. All government workers should understand that corruption and waste are extremely serious crimes. The struggle against corruption and waste has achieved some success in the past, and we should continue to work hard in the future." Three years ago, when national revolutionary victory was approaching, Chairman Mao issued a warning to our entire party and all cadres: "There may be some communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and they are worthy of the title of heroes in the face of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attacks of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in the face of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." However, due to our insufficient understanding and lack of political vigilance, a few cadres were defeated in the face of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and individual party members and cadres even degenerated and transformed into traitors of the country and the people. This is exactly what Chairman Mao pointed out thirteen years ago, that they "abandoned halfway" the revolutionary cause. The problem associated with corruption and waste is bureaucracy. Many cadres, even leading cadres, have developed a widespread and serious bureaucratic style because they have not studied Chairman Mao's works and the central government's repeated instructions. Chairman Mao said in "Economic Problems and Financial Problems" in 1942: "Many units below act independently, and the leadership above lacks unified guidance, unified plans, and unified inspections in terms of policy principles and work content, causing various departments to not know what should not be done, or they knowingly violate the rules. As a result, independent actions and separatist tendencies occur. Actions that undermine policy principles and violate government decrees also occur. Actions that infringe on the interests of the people also occur. Economic units not only fail to assist each other but also fight and hinder each other. The phenomenon of concealing information from superiors while not concealing it from subordinates, or concealing it from both, ambushing, and telling lies also occurs. The phenomenon of extreme waste, spending lavishly, seeking extravagance, and not seeking practical results also occurs. What is particularly serious is that extremely bad phenomena such as corruption and gambling have occurred among some cadres. Some individual cadres are tempted by material things and are unwilling to be loyal to the sacred cause of communism, becoming completely corrupt. There are also some cadres who have become moldy and need to be exposed to the sun to regain their health. All these bad things and all these malpractices have occurred in varying degrees among the cadres of some troops and some institutions and schools. In the future, all higher leading organs of the troops and institutions and schools must focus on taking care of the overall situation, grasping policies, and having unified plans and unified inspections for the production activities of their subordinate units. It is absolutely not allowed to have independent actions, separatist tendencies, actions that undermine policies, violate laws and decrees, infringe on the interests of the people, fighting and hindering each other among units, and phenomena such as corruption, waste, and gambling among cadres. If such phenomena occur again, discipline must be strictly enforced, with criticism for minor offenses and punishment for serious offenses. It is absolutely not permissible to condone them and instead call it a 'lenient policy'." ("Economic Problems and Financial Problems") It cannot be said that those of us who have committed bureaucracy have not read this document, but only that we have not inspected our thinking based on Chairman Mao's instructions and implemented them in our work.
    This time, after the "Three-Anti" movement, due to the development of widespread ideological criticism and extensive democratic movements, in-depth inspections were conducted on work style and leadership attitudes, which further deepened Mao Zedong Thought throughout the party and army. The nationwide "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements brought unprecedented new atmosphere to the entire society. Unlawful capitalists honestly abide by the law, prices across the country have fallen, the market and finance are stable, and the living standards of the masses have improved. An old man of seventy said when he traveled from Changsha to Shenyang in Northeast China: "I have lived to seventy years old and have truly seen that no one picks up lost items and that doors are not locked at night." Many soldiers also said: "Without corruption and waste, allowances have also increased." At the same time, due to the deepening of ideological criticism, the work style of agencies and troops has been renewed. Bureaucracy in leadership has been reduced, corruption and waste have been basically overcome, and work enthusiasm has become more full. For example, the working class in Northeast China, in response to Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and conserve 8 million tons of grain, various industrial and mining enterprises launched a warm and widespread movement to increase production and conserve, and in just three months, they have exceeded the target by establishing a plan to increase production and conserve more than 10 million tons. In particular, the movement to practice strict economy has prompted staff and workers to study their work. Jiang Wanshou, deputy director of the Shenyang Clothing Factory, used the Kovalev work method to summarize the "unified operation method for summer clothes" and the advanced continuous operation method of "no lifting the presser foot, no running empty trips, no picking threads, and no stopping the machine." This increased the production efficiency of all summer clothes by 15 percent, and the quality pass rate reached more than 98 percent. Another example is that after the "Three-Anti" movement, employees of the dyeing and weaving factory have discovered 79 tricks. The "small shaft washing method" created by worker Wang Zhongming alone can save 3,840 tons of grain in a month, exceeding the factory's annual production increase and conservation plan. In order to avoid waste, several business departments of the Northeast Logistics Department have strengthened the review of budgets, refined calculations on the use of materials, and strengthened the inspection and cost accounting of processing orders, which can save the country more than 337 billion yuan and 50,000 tons of grain in half a year.
    Today, the entire party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country know that the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements proves the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and also proves Chairman Mao's scientific foresight eighteen years ago and over the years. At the same time, it also proves that each of our communist party members, youth league members, and revolutionary cadres not only did not fully understand and practice Chairman Mao's thought in the past, but also can only say that today is the beginning of learning.
    One of the new atmospheres after the "Three-Anti" movement is that the atmosphere of learning is stronger than ever before. Responsible cadres at all levels have established personal study plans to strengthen the study and research of Mao Zedong Thought, and began to study the literature in Volumes I and II of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" related to the "Three-Anti" movement. Among them, comrades with higher theoretical levels have begun to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Many people who were not active in learning before the "Three-Anti" movement have become active after the "Three-Anti" movement.
    The People's Daily's "July 1st" editorial called on us to strengthen theoretical study. This call is timely and necessary. We must all work hard to study and improve our ideological level to welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction!

    认真努力学习毛泽东思想
    张平凯
    “三反”运动以后，很多老同志注意了学习。大家都说“过去读‘毛泽东选集’，看不出来问题，现在才发觉有许多问题都是毛主席老早讲过的。”我们从“毛泽东选集”第一卷看起，无论是对组织领导、群众运动、政权建设、军队指挥（军事战略战术思想），财经政策、文化教育、统一战线、建党原则、思想教育等，都是具有高度的马克思列宁主义科学分析与预见的。应该承认，我们在“三反”运动之前，不少党员干部甚至部分负责干部，是没有重视毛泽东思想的学习的，没有认真研究过毛主席历次警惕全党的许多重要指示。在“三反”和“五反”运动揭发了大量“三害”“五毒”的具体事实以后，我们回过头去读一读毛主席在十八年前所著“我们的经济政策”一文中所说的下面几句话，体会就特别深刻了：“财政的支出，应该根据节省的方针。应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。反对贪污和浪费的斗争，过去有了些成绩，以后还应用力。”三年前全国革命胜利快要到来的时候，毛主席又对我们全党和全体干部发出了警告：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”但是由于我们体会不够，缺乏政治警惕，因而在资产阶级猖狂进攻面前，少数干部打了败仗，个别党员和干部乃至蜕化变质，变成了国家人民的蟊贼。这正是毛主席十三年前所指出的，他们对革命事业“半途而废”了。与贪污浪费相关联的问题就是官僚主义，许多干部甚至领导干部，由于没有很好研究毛主席的著作以及中央屡次的指示，因而产生了普遍的严重的官僚主义作风。毛主席在一九四二年“经济问题与财政问题”中就说了：“下面多少单位各自为政，上面没有或缺少在政策原则上与工作内容上的统一的指导、统一的计划与统一的检查，致使各部分不知道什么事是不应该做的，或者明知故犯。于是各自为政，闹独立性的事也发生了。破坏政策原则，破坏政府法令的事也发生了。侵害人民利益的事也发生了。各个经济单位之间，不但没有协助，反而互相斗争，互相妨碍的事也发生了。瞒上不瞒下，瞒上又瞒下，打埋伏，说谎话的现象也发生了。极端浪费，一掷千金，但求铺张，不求实效的现象也发生了。尤其严重的，是在一部分干部之间发生了贪污赌博等极恶劣的现象。有个别的干部是被物质所诱惑，因而不愿忠实于共产主义的神圣事业，完全腐化了。另有若干干部则起了霉，要在太阳底下晒一晒才能恢复健康。所有这些坏事，所有这些弊端，在一部分军队与一部分机关学校的干部中，都是或多或少地发生过的。今后所有军队与机关学校的一切上级领导机关，必须着重于照顾全局，掌握政策，对所属各单位的生产活动一定要有统一的计划，统一的检查，绝对不容许再有各自为政，闹独立性，破坏政策，破坏法令，侵害人民利益，各单位互相斗争，互相妨碍，以及干部中贪污浪费赌博等现象再行发生。如再有这类现象发生，必须严申纪律，轻者批评，重者处罚，决不可对他们纵容，反而美其名曰‘宽大政策’。”（“经济问题与财政问题”）不能说我们犯有官僚主义的人都没有读过这个文件，只能说我们没有根据毛主席的指示检查思想并在工作中加以执行。
    这次经过“三反”运动，由于开展了普遍的思想批判，展开了广泛的民主运动，对工作作风，领导态度都作深入检查，才使毛泽东思想进一步在全党全军中深入了。全国的“三反”“五反”运动，给整个社会带来了从来未有的新气象，不法资本家老实守法了，全国范围的物价降低了，市面金融稳定了，群众生活水平提高了，有一个七十岁的老头从长沙到东北沈阳时说：“我活到七十岁才真正看到路不拾遗，夜不闭户”，许多战士也说：“没有了贪污浪费，津贴也增加了。”同时，由于思想批判的深入，使机关部队的工作作风为之一新，领导上官僚主义减少了，贪污浪费已基本克服，工作情绪也更加饱满。如东北地区的工人阶级，为响应高岗同志增产节约八百万吨粮食的号召，各工矿企业部门掀起了热烈而普遍的增产节约运动，仅三个月时间已超额订立了一千万吨以上的增产节约计划。特别是厉行节约的运动，引起工作人员及工人钻研工作，沈阳被服一厂副厂长姜万寿，运用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，先后总结出“夏服统一操作法”和“不抬压脚、不跑空趟、不?线头、不停机器”的先进连续操作法。使全部夏服的生产效率提高了百分之十五，质量合格率达到百分之九十八以上。又如染织厂职工在“三反”运动后已发现了七十九个窍门，仅工人王仲明创造的“小轴压洗方法”一个月可节约三千八百四十吨粮食，超过该厂一年的增产节约计划。为避免浪费，仅东北后勤几个业务部门由于加强了对预算的审查，材料使用上的精核细算以及加强加工定货方面的检查与成本核算，半年即可给国家节约三千三百七十多亿元，及五万吨粮食。
    今天全党、全军、全国人民都知道“三反”和“五反”运动的伟大胜利，正是证明了毛泽东思想的胜利，也正是证明毛主席十八年前以及历年来的科学预见，同时也证明了我们每个共产党员、青年团员和革命干部，不仅过去对毛主席的思想还未完全理解与实践，而且今天还只能说是学习的开始。
    “三反”运动后的新气象之一是学习空气比过去任何时候都浓厚。各级负责干部为加强对毛泽东思想的学习钻研，订立了个人的学习计划，开始研究“毛泽东选集”一、二卷有关“三反”运动方面的文献。其中理论水平较高的同志，对毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”开始了研究。在“三反”运动前许多不积极学习的人，经过“三反”运动后都积极起来了。
    人民日报“七一”社论号召我们加强理论学习，这个号召是适时的和必要的。我们大家都要努力学习，提高我们的思想水平，以迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设！
