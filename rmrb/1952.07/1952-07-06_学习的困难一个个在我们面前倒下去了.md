Editor's Note: In order to meet the needs of the construction of the new China, a large number of military and government cadres were transferred to universities for study. This article reports on the situation of a group of military cadres studying in the cadre补习班(remedial class) of Nankai University. It tells us what difficulties they encountered and how they overcame these difficulties with a fighting spirit in a tense, pleasant, mutually supportive and loving learning environment.

　　At the end of April, in accordance with the order of the superiors to send us to study technology, we packed our bags and left the army amidst the applause of farewell. Three hundred comrades from different regions and different posts gathered together. Some came from the capital Beijing, some from Nanjing, and some even from Zhangjiakou outside the Great Wall, but all came from the People's Liberation Army. Before coming to the school, we were all engaged in military, political, administrative, and educational work in the army. Now, for the construction of the motherland, we have put down the work we are doing and picked up the burden of "learning."

　　On the first day at Nankai University, the old students gathered by the roadside, shouting slogans such as "Salute to the revolutionary cadres," "Welcome new partners," and "Learn the excellent qualities of revolutionary cadres" one after another. How loud was the song of "Unity is strength"! They had already vacated many houses for us to live in three days ago, and the dormitories were full of welcome slogans. We didn't have washbasins, so many brand-new washbasins were forcibly stuffed into our hands by the old classmates. We didn't have water bottles, and many classmates rushed to lend us their thermos bottles. Some comrades were unfamiliar with everything because they were new here, and couldn't even find the toilet or dining hall, but immediately an old classmate would take you there. These days, all we have seen are enthusiastic and sincere faces, and all we have held are full and fiery hands. This makes us deeply realize the greatness of the Party and the warmth of the revolutionary big family.

　　After coming to the school, the comrades continued to maintain the revolutionary traditions of diligence, bravery, and hard work. After a day of rest, they carried out environmental cleaning and sanitation work. We not only cleared the messy bricks in front of the dormitory, but also built a neat brick road and a small stone bridge, and the sewage ditch was also cleaned by us. The quilts in the room were all folded squarely, and the shoes, towels, and cups were arranged neatly. We also maintained the habit of running in the morning. The leave application system and the meeting reporting system were quickly established. A temporary district team was established on the administrative side to assist in various tasks; the Youth League general branch and branches were also established at the same time; administrative life and organizational life have initially embarked on the right track. Originally, the old students did not have the habit of getting up to run in the morning, but now most of the students have automatically organized to run. At the same time, we also learned a lot from the old students. In the past, due to the work environment, many comrades did not like activities very much, and were extremely silent in life. Therefore, when dancing group dances, the older comrades felt it was a burden. But today, under the call of the student union and the influence of the old students, the comrades have realized that active life can indeed restore people's energy, and some comrades who do not like activities have also begun to become active and dance group dances with everyone holding hands.

　　After more than a week of preparation, the class officially started. The school divided the comrades into six classes according to their educational level. The comrades threw themselves into the learning upsurge with great enthusiasm and full spirit. But because they had lived in the army for several years, most of their knowledge of mathematics and physics had been forgotten, and everyone encountered some difficulties in learning. Some students can understand in class, but after class they can't grasp the key points, and they don't know where to start when reviewing, and they don't know how to start when picking up exercises. Some students don't know how to manage their time, looking here and flipping there, and two hours of self-study class pass by in a flash. However, we were not intimidated by the difficulties. The comrades unanimously stated that they would carry forward the spirit of the People's Liberation Army of "invincible and invincible". We will fight a big victory on the learning front. Facts have proved that our determination is not empty. The difficulties of learning fell one by one before us. For example, Comrade Chen Xuemin, he originally only had a primary school education, had never learned trigonometry, and was not even familiar with the English alphabet. When he started learning, he felt very difficult, and he had to spend three hours reviewing after listening to a lesson. Sometimes he could only understand one-fifth of it. But no difficulty can scare a Communist Party member. Under the encouragement and help of the organization and comrades, he first established a strong learning confidence. He copied more than a dozen trigonometric and physics formulas and pasted them under the top of the bed, and recited them several times every day when he went to bed or woke up. Now he has begun to catch up with everyone. The learning enthusiasm of other comrades is also very high. Many people lie in bed reading books and doing problems when they wake up in the morning; some comrades are also thinking about exercises during their lunch break. In the evening, if you go to check the铺(beds), you will definitely find someone talking in their sleep: "X+Y"... Before eating and standing in line, some were debating problems on the playground, and some were squatting on the ground drawing pictures with chopsticks. Time is especially precious to us. Many comrades were buried in their rooms studying on Saturday nights and Sundays. We also organized mutual aid groups, which gave great help to comrades with poorer levels. In addition to giving specific help to some students in terms of professional work, the mutual aid group also took care of them in life, such as helping with washing clothes and letting them do less public service and errands. With the establishment of mutual aid groups, we also set some learning systems, such as the小组(groups) holding a "learning碰头会(brainstorming session)" for five minutes every day, where everyone would raise the problems they didn't understand that day and their opinions on teaching, so that they could reflect opinions and discover problems in a timely manner, and also facilitate the organization of mutual assistance and enrichment of tutoring content.

　　Our teacher-student relationship is also very harmonious. Before we came to the school, the teachers had already formed teaching groups and tutoring groups. Many teachers with a lot of兼课(part-time teaching) signed up to participate, hoping to teach us well. For example, Teacher Jiang Ancai not only teaches patiently and carefully in class, but also solves difficult problems for students in his spare time; Teacher Liu Changkai always uses popular examples to explain repeatedly and patiently when teaching.

　　Difficulties are still heavily hindering our progress, but we believe that as long as we study hard under the leadership and education of the school's Party organization and teachers, difficulties can be completely overcome.

    学习的困难一个个在我们面前倒下去了
    谢鸿
    编者按：为了适应新中国建设的需要，大批部队和机关干部被调到高等学校学习。本文所报道的是一批部队干部在南开大学干部补习班学习的情况。它告诉我们他们碰到什么困难，以及他们怎样在紧张、愉快、互助互爱的学习环境中，用战斗精神克服着这些困难。
    四月底，我们遵照上级调我们去学习技术的命令，打起背包，在欢送的掌声中离开了部队。来自不同地区、不同岗位的三百个同志聚集在一起了。有的来自首都北京，有的来自南京，有的却来自塞外的张家口，但都来自人民解放军。在没有来校前，我们都在部队中担任着军事、政治、行政、教育等工作，现在，为了祖国的建设事业，我们放下了正在进行的工作，将“学习”的担子挑了起来。
    到南开大学的第一天，老同学都集合在马路旁，此起彼伏地高呼着“向革命干部致敬”、“欢迎新伙伴”、“学习革命干部的优良品质”等口号；“团结就是力量”的歌声是多么响亮！他们早在三天前就腾出许多房子给我们住，在寝室中满贴着欢迎的标语。我们没有脸盆，就有很多崭新的脸盆从老同学的手中硬塞给我们；我们没有水壶，不少同学就抢着把热水瓶借给我们。有的同志因为初来对一切都陌生，甚至连厕所饭厅也找不到，但是马上就有老同学将你带去。这些日子，我们所见到的都是一张张热情真挚的脸，我们所握到的都是丰满火热的手。这使我们深深地体会到党的伟大，革命大家庭的温暖。
    来校后，同志们继续保持着勤劳勇敢，艰苦朴素的革命传统，休息一天后，便进行环境清洁卫生的工作。我们不但将宿舍前面的乱砖清除了，而且还砌了一条整齐的砖道和小石桥，污水沟也被我们打扫干净了。室内的被子都是摺得方方的，鞋子、毛巾、漱口杯都排列得很整齐。我们也保持着早晨起来跑步的习惯。请销假制度、会议汇报制度都很快地建立了。行政方面成立了临时区队协助进行各种工作；青年团总支、分支也同时成立起来；行政生活、组织生活都初步地步入了正轨。本来老同学是没有早晨起来跑步的习惯的，现在大部分同学都自动地组织起来跑步了。同时，我们也从老同学那里学习到许多东西。过去由于工作环境的关系，许多同志不大爱好活动，生活上表现得极为沉默，因此跳集体舞的时候，年龄大一点的同志就觉得是一个负担。但是今天，在学生会的号召和老同学的影响下，同志们都认识到活跃的生活确能恢复人们的精力，一些不爱活动的同志也开始活跃起来，和大家拉着手一起跳集体舞了。
    经过一个多星期的准备，正式开课了。学校根据大家的文化程度编成六个班。同志们都以极大的热情和饱满的精神投入学习热潮。但因为在部队中过了几年生活，数理化的知识大部分都忘了，大家在学习上遇到了一些困难。有的同学上课能听懂，但下课后抓不住重点，复习起来没有头绪，拿起习题不知从何下手；有的同学不会支配时间，东看看西翻翻，二个小时的自修课一下就过去了。但是，我们没有被困难吓倒，同志们一致表示要发扬人民解放军“无坚不攻、攻无不克”的精神。要在学习战线上打个大胜仗。事实证明，我们的决心不是空的，学习的困难一个个在我们面前倒下去了。如陈学民同志，他原来只有高小程度，三角代数根本没学过，连英文字母也不很熟识。开始学习时，他感到很困难，听了一课就得化三小时复习；有时他只能听懂五分之一。但是任何困难是吓不住一个共产党员的，在组织方面和同志们的鼓励、帮助下，他首先树立了坚强的学习信心，他将十多个三角和物理公式抄贴在床顶下，每天上床睡觉或醒来时就面对它念几遍。现在他已开始赶上了大家。其他同志的学习情绪也是很高涨的，有很多人早上醒来时就躺在床上看书做题；有的同志在午睡时也在想习题。晚上，如果你去查一查铺，一定会发现有人在说梦话：“X＋Y”……吃饭站队前，有的在操场上辩论着问题，有的蹲在地上用筷子画起图来了。时间对于我们是特别宝贵的，星期六晚上、星期天许多同志在寝室里埋头学习着。我们也组织了互助组，这给了程度较差的同志以很大的帮助。互助组除了在业务上给以具体帮助某些同学外，在生活上也给以照顾，如帮助洗衣服、让他们少出公差和勤务。随着互助组的建立，我们还定出一些学习制度，如小组每天抽五分钟开“学习碰头会”，由大家将当天没有搞懂的问题和对教学的意见提出来，这样既能及时地反映意见，发现问题，又便于组织互助、充实辅导内容。
    我们的师生关系也是很融洽的。在我们没有到校以前，教师们就已组成了教学组及辅导组，许多兼课很多的教师都纷纷报名参加，希望把我们教好。例如江安才教师，他不但在课堂上耐心认真地教课，而且在课余为同学解决难题；刘长凯教师，授课时总是反复、耐心地用通俗的例子来解释。
    困难在我们前进的道路上还是重重地障碍着，但我们相信，只要在学校党组织和教师们的领导和教育下，努力学习，困难是完全可以克服的。
