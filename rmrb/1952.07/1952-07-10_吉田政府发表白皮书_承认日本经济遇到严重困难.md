    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Japanese Yoshida government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry released a white paper on Japanese trade issues on June 25th. As Kyodo News acknowledged, this white paper "paints a bleak picture."

    The white paper first acknowledges: "The Japanese economy, which mainly relies on foreign trade, has encountered serious difficulties." The white paper states that compared to the pre-war years of 1934-1936, Japan's exports in 1951 were only 31 percent, while imports reached 47 percent. In terms of monetary value, Japan's exports last year were worth $1.35 billion, while imports (including U.S. "aid") totaled $1.64 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $290 million. The main sources for making up this trade deficit are the U.S.'s "special procurement orders" for the Korean War and the consumption of U.S. troops stationed in Japan. The white paper also believes that such a balance of international payments is "based on very unstable foundations."

    On July 1st, the Yoshida government's Economic Stabilization Board also released a white paper. Although this white paper made every effort to tout the "revival" of the Japanese economy after the war, it also stated that the recovery of Japan's national economy "is not based on lasting factors"; Japan's "national income is far less than other countries." According to the white paper's statistics, the prices of consumer goods in Japan rose by 18 percent last year, but actual wages increased by only 9 percent. Therefore, last year the consumption level in Japanese cities "remained" at about 70 percent of pre-war levels.

    吉田政府发表白皮书
    承认日本经济遇到严重困难
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府通商产业省在六月二十五日发表了关于日本贸易问题的白皮书。如共同社承认的，这个白皮书“描绘了一幅黯澹的图画”。
    白皮书首先承认：“主要依靠对外贸易的日本经济已遭遇到严重的困难”。白皮书说，和战前的一九三四—三六年相比较，日本在一九五一年的出口只有百分之三十一，而入口则达百分之四十七。就金额来说，日本去年的出口共值十三亿五千万美元，入口（包括美“援”在内）共值十六亿四千万美元，入超达二亿九千万美元。弥补这项贸易逆差的主要来源是美国用于侵朝战争的“特别需要订货”和驻日美军的消费。这样的国际收支平衡，白皮书也认为：“其基础是很不稳固的”。
    七月一日，吉田政府经济安定本部也发表了一个白皮书，虽然这个白皮书尽力吹嘘战后日本经济的“复兴”，但是，它同时又说：日本国民经济的恢复是“没有持久的因素做基础的”；日本的“国民收入远比其他国家为少”。据白皮书的统计，去年日本的消费品的价格上涨了百分之十八，但是实际工资却仅增加百分之九。因此，去年日本城市的消费水平“停留”在战前的百分之七十左右。
