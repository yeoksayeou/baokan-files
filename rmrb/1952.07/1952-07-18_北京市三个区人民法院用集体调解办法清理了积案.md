    Three District People's Courts in Beijing Use Collective Mediation Methods to Clear Up Backlogged Cases
    Li Wen

    Following the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Outer City, Central City, and Northern City District People's Courts of Beijing adopted mass-based collective mediation methods when handling civil cases and minor criminal cases. The result of adopting this method was the implementation of the mass line in judicial work, and the old style of "sitting in court and asking questions" was overcome. Consequently, many long-backlogged cases were processed in a short period of time, and the efficiency of judicial work was significantly improved. This method of collectively mediating cases is carried out in the following steps:

    I. Classify various cases according to their nature. For example, debt cases can be divided into loans, purchase and sale debts, partnerships, and industrial and commercial contracts. Each category is further divided into several groups to facilitate mediation. The principle is that industrial and commercial debt cases are grouped and mediated by industry; marriage and housing cases are grouped and mediated by region. After grouping, representatives and activists from relevant units are absorbed to participate in the mediation together, according to the nature of each type of case. For example, when dealing with industrial and commercial debt cases, people from the trade unions, industry associations, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce can be absorbed to participate; when dealing with marriage cases, people from the Democratic Women's Federation can be absorbed to participate; and when dealing with housing disputes, street activists can be absorbed to participate. The cases mediated by the representatives and activists of these organizations all occur within their respective industries or regions, or are related to their work, so they generally understand the crux of the dispute, the history of the parties involved, and their ideological situations. Therefore, they can help the People's Court handle cases quickly and correctly.

    II. The court convenes representatives and activists from relevant mass organizations to jointly analyze and study the case, clarify the facts, understand the ideological situations of the parties involved, identify the key to the dispute, and propose specific methods for handling each type of case. For certain important and complex cases, activists should also be organized to conduct focused investigations under the guidance of cadres. Then, a preparatory meeting is held, where the person in charge of the court explains the policies, tasks, and working methods to the cadres and activists, and makes specific assignments: cadres are responsible for grasping the policies and reviewing the mediation results; activists assist in persuasion and mediation.

    III. Convene a meeting of the parties involved, where the person in charge of the court, based on the crux of the dispute in each type of case, specifically explains the principles and methods of the People's Government for handling mass disputes; analyzes and criticizes the ideological situations of the parties involved (such as the idea of "competing for pride, not for wealth," or "going to court means engaging in warfare," which hinder the progress of mediation work), overcomes the mutually antagonistic emotions between the two sides; and explains the significance of activists assisting in the work, so as to facilitate the work of the activists. When explaining policies, efforts should be made to be concise and vivid, combining with the ideological situations of the parties involved, and avoid empty and abstract generalities.

    IV. After meeting with the parties involved, they can be divided into groups according to the different types of cases, managed by activists, and collective mediation can be carried out. However, because there is still antagonism between the parties involved, it is not advisable to immediately conduct mediation. It is best to first deliberate within the group and mobilize both parties to meet and reconcile on their own. In the process of reconciliation, the activists in charge of the group should take care of all aspects, and at the same time, focus on helping some parties to reach reconciliation. Facts have proved that if the activists are managed well, they can play a great role in enabling cases to be reconciled. The Ninth District once used the method of collective mediation to handle such a debt case: A construction contractor contracted for a renovation project, and the original agreed price was 1.3 million yuan, but no contract was signed at that time. Later, the construction contractor wanted 1.6 million yuan, which the other party was unwilling to pay, so they sued in court. During the collective mediation, this case was handled by the rubber industry group. The rubber industry group was well aware of the contractor's background, knew that he wanted to ask for more money, and also knew that he had not obtained a construction business license or paid business tax. During the group discussion, the contractor was still very cunning; but after an activist from the rubber industry participating in the mediation exposed his improper behavior, he immediately had nothing to say, and the case was successfully reconciled. In the process of deliberation and reconciliation, the cadres or activists in charge of the group should always discover and cultivate activists among the parties involved, and mobilize them to use the method of sharing their own experiences to help others mediate disputes. This approach is very effective. For example, a tricycle worker knocked over a cigarette stall. After collective mediation, he admitted his mistake and compensated the cigarette vendor for the loss. The court cadre mobilized him to participate in mediation work. When he was mediating an oil debt dispute, he said to the person who owed the debt: "I damaged someone else's cigarettes and had to pay compensation; what can you say about using someone else's oil? If you can't pay all at once, you can pay in installments." The party involved thought this was correct, and the case was settled in this way.

    V. For cases that cannot be resolved through self-negotiation and reconciliation, it is necessary to promptly transition to group deliberation, so as to avoid prolonging the time and creating a "fatigue mediation" phenomenon. If some cases still cannot be reconciled after deliberation, and the court has grasped the true facts of the case, it can adopt the opinions of the mass deliberation and announce the judgment on the spot.

    VI. For cases that cannot be reconciled at the mediation meeting, activists should be mobilized to continue mediation after the meeting, and a final decision should be made regularly. Although such cases cannot be concluded immediately, what is lacking is only a portion of the materials. After the activists assist in the investigation after the meeting, even if they cannot be reconciled, it is easy to make a judgment. In addition, for cases successfully mediated by activists, activists can be mobilized to assist in execution under the principle of voluntariness.

    The result of adopting this collective mediation method is, first of all, to improve the efficiency of judicial work and effectively clear up backlogged cases. In May, the three district courts in Beijing concluded a total of 3,807 cases, of which cases handled by collective mediation methods accounted for about 75% of the cases received. On average, judicial cadres can conclude three cases per day, and some can conclude four cases (including the time for preparing to handle cases). Such high work efficiency has never been seen before. Secondly, it reduces a lot of trouble for the masses. In the past, a case often went through filing a complaint, responding to a summons, and court hearings, and could not be concluded after three or five hearings, which delayed a lot of the masses' production time and working time. If they also encountered black lawyers and bad elements who instigated lawsuits and extorted money, the losses to the masses would be even greater. Now, due to the adoption of collective mediation methods, not only is the waste of manpower and material resources avoided, extortion and blackmail cannot occur, but also cadres have realized the power of the masses and changed the past detached style of "sitting in court and asking questions."

    The collective mediation method adopted this time is a step forward compared to the previous collective mediation method. The previous collective mediation only concentrated the parties involved in the case, explained the policies to them, and then the cadres mediated the cases one by one. This actually only saved the time of explaining the policies and did not rely on the masses to solve their own disputes. The collective mediation method adopted this time, under the leadership of the court, further leverages the power of mass organizations and activists, and unfolds criticism and self-criticism within the masses through self-reconciliation and group deliberation. Therefore, it makes the parties involved feel convinced, which is much better than the previous collective mediation in terms of following the mass line. Many parties involved said: "When we enter the court, our faces are long, and when we leave the court, our faces are round." Meaning that they came in angry and left smiling. The party involved Zhao Rugui said: "This time, I participated in the collective mediation meeting, which not only solved my own problems, but also learned a lot of policies. I hope to participate in such meetings more often in the future." This shows that the collective mediation method is an effective method for raising the level of mass awareness, strengthening the unity of the people, and resolving mass disputes.

    Collective mediation has many advantages, but it is also necessary to prevent the following deviations: (1) not explaining policies, but simply using the method of "muddying the waters" without principles to mediate; (2) mediation of cases can only use democratic persuasion methods and cannot use coercive methods; therefore, it is necessary to prevent and correct the possible violations of the principle of voluntariness and forced mediation that may occur by certain cadres and activists (such situations have occurred in Beijing, but only individually). (3) Cases that cannot be mediated should be judged by the court in a timely manner, and the litigation should not be delayed due to emphasizing mediation. Some places have experienced such deviations in the past, and they should not be repeated in the future.

    北京市三个区人民法院用集体调解办法清理了积案
    李文
    “三反”“五反”运动后，北京市外城、中城、北城三个区人民法院，在处理民事案件及轻微的刑事案件时，采用了群众性的集体调解方法。采用这一方法的结果，司法工作中的群众路线得到了贯彻，“坐堂问案”的旧作风得到了克服，因而在短期内处理了许多积压很久的案件，司法工作的效率显著提高。这种集体调解案件的方法，是按照以下的步骤进行的。
    一、按照性质把各种案件作一分类。如债务案可分为借贷、买卖欠款、合伙、工商承揽等。每一类再分成若干小组，便于进行调解。原则是工商债务案按行业分组进行调解；婚姻、房屋等案按地区分组进行调解；在分组以后，就按照各类案件的性质，分别吸收有关单位的代表和积极分子，共同参加调解。如在处理工商债务案时，即可吸收工会、行业公会及工商联合会的人参加；在处理婚姻案件时，吸收民主妇女联合会的人参加；在处理房屋纠纷的案件时，吸收街道积极分子参加。这些团体的代表和积极分子所参加调解的案件，都发生在本行业、本地区内，或者和自己的工作有关，所以他们一般的都了解成讼的症结、当事人的历史和思想情况，因此他们能够帮助人民法院迅速而正确地处理案件。
    二、由法院召集有关的群众组织的代表和积极分子，共同分析研究案情，弄清事实，了解当事人的思想情况，找出成讼的关键，并提出处理各类案件的具体办法。对于某些重要的、复杂的案件，还应在干部的掌握之下，组织积极分子有重点地进行调查。然后开准备会议，由法院的负责人向干部和积极分子讲解政策、任务和工作方法，并具体分工：由干部掌握政策，审核调解结果；积极分子协助进行说服调解。
    三、召集当事人开会，由法院负责人根据各类案件的成讼症结，具体地说明人民政府处理群众纠纷的原则和办法；对当事人的思想情况（如有些案件的当事人，抱有“争气不争财”、“到了法院就是刀兵相见”等等的思想，阻碍着调解工作的进行），进行分析批判，克服双方互相对立的情绪；并说明积极分子协助工作的意义，便于积极分子进行工作。在讲解政策时，应结合当事人的思想情况，尽量做到简明生动，少讲空洞的大道理。
    四、和当事人开会后，即可按照案件的不同类型，将当事人分成小组，由积极分子掌握，进行集体调解。但因当事人之间尚有对立情绪，所以不宜于马上进行调解。最好先在组内进行酝酿，动员当事人双方自行见面和解。在和解过程中，掌握小组的积极分子要照顾全面，同时也要有重点地帮助一些当事人达到和解。事实证明，如果积极分子掌握得好，他们可以起很大的作用，使案件得到和解。九区曾采用集体调解的方法，处理了这样的一个债务案件：有一营造商人包了一处修缮工程，原议定工价一百三十万元，但当时未立合同。后来，这个营造商人要一百六十万元，对方不愿意，因此告到法院。在集体调解时，这一案件即由橡胶业小组处理。橡胶业小组深悉这个商人的底情，知道他是想多要工价，而且知道他未领营造业执照，未缴行商税。在小组讨论时，这个商人仍很狡猾；但在参加调解的一个橡胶业积极分子揭穿了他的不正当行为后，他立刻就无话可说了，因而这一案件顺利和解。在酝酿和解的过程中，掌握小组的干部或积极分子，应随时在当事人中发现和培养积极分子，动员他们用现身说法的办法帮助别人调解纠纷。这种作法收效很大。例如，有一位三轮车工人撞翻了一个纸烟摊。经集体调解，他承认了错误，赔偿了烟贩的损失。法院干部就动员他参加调解工作。他在调解一件油债纠纷时，对欠债不还的人说：“我撞坏了人家的纸烟，还要赔偿；你用了人家的油还有什么话说呢？一次拿不出，可以分期付款。”当事人认为这话正确，结果就这样定了案。
    五、对于不能自行协商和解的案件，必须适时地转入小组评议，以免时间拖长，造成“疲劳调解”的现象。如果有的案件经过评议仍不能和解，而法院又掌握了真实的案情，就可以采纳群众评议的意见，当场宣布判决。
    六、对于在调解会上不能和解的案件，应动员积极分子在会后继续进行调解，定期作最后处理。这种案件虽然不能马上作出结论；但所缺乏的也只是一部分材料，经积极分子在会后协助调查，即使不能和解，也很容易判决了。此外，凡经积极分子调解成功的案子，可在自愿原则下动员积极分子协助执行。
    采用这种集体调解方法的结果，首先是提高了司法工作的效率，有效地清理了积案。北京市三个区法院五月份共结案三千八百零七件，其中用集体调解方法而处理的案件约占传到案件的百分之七十五。一般司法干部每日平均结案三件，有的可以结四件（包括准备处理案件的时间在内）。这样高的工作效率是过去从来没有的。其次，给群众减少了许多麻烦。过去一件案子，往往经过递状、应传、庭讯，三讯五讯不能了结，耽误了群众的不少生产时间和工作时间。如果再遇到黑律师和坏分子挑词架讼，从中敲诈，则群众损失更大。现在，由于采用了集体调解的方法，不但避免了人力物力的浪费，敲诈勒索的事情不可能发生，而且使干部认识了群众的力量，改变了过去那种单纯“坐堂问案”的脱离群众的作风。
    这次所采用的集体调解方法，已比过去的集体调解方法发展了一步。过去的集体调解，只是集中案件当事人，向他们讲解政策，然后由干部一案一案地进行调解。这实际上只是节省了讲解政策的时间，并未做到依靠群众、由群众自己解决自己的纠纷。这一次所采用的集体调解方法，则在法院的领导之下，进一步发挥了群众组织和积极分子的力量，通过自行和解和小组评议，在群众的内部展开了批评和自我批评，因此做到了使当事人口服心服，较之过去的集体调解在走群众路线方面要好得多。许多当事人说：“我们进法院时脸是长的，出法院时脸是圆的。”意思是说生着气进来，笑着出去了。当事人赵如桂说：“我这次参加集体调解大会，不仅解决了自己的问题，并且学习了许多政策。我希望以后多参加这样的会。”这就说明集体调解的方法，是提高群众觉悟水平，加强人民内部团结，解决群众纠纷的有效方法。
    集体调解的优点很多，但也必须注意防止以下的偏向：（一）不讲政策，只是无原则地用“和稀泥”的方法进行调解；（二）调解案件只能用民主说服的方法，不能用强迫的方法；因此必须防止和纠正某些干部和积极分子可能发生的违反自愿原则、强制进行调解的做法（北京市即曾发生过此种情形，不过只是个别的）。（三）调解不成的案件，应由法院及时判决，千万不要因强调调解，反而把诉讼拖延下去。有的地方过去曾发生过这样的偏向，今后不应重复。
