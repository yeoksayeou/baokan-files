Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Western European and American bourgeois public opinion is increasingly voicing apprehension about the consequences of the "General Treaty" signed by the United States, Britain, and France with the West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer, fearing that this treaty will have very unfavorable consequences for them.

    The "General Treaty" has caused great shock among some bourgeois figures in Western European countries. This sentiment is clearly reflected in their newspapers. Western European bourgeois newspapers, seeing the fierce opposition to the "General Treaty" from the vast majority of people in Germany and Western Europe, are therefore very doubtful about the stability of this treaty. The British "Manchester Guardian" said: "This treaty is concluded with half of Germany, not with the whole of Germany. This inevitably makes it unreliable." The Western European bourgeoisie is not only afraid of the growing protest movement of the Western European masses, but also afraid of the threat to their interests from the revived West German militarism. The "Manchester Guardian" said: Many French people feel "unhappy" about the "General Treaty" because "they fear that the German army will eventually become the most powerful part of the European army and rule the European army." The British "Reynold's News" said: It is a crazy plan for Western countries to once again bring the Trojan horse (referring to West German militarism) into the center of Western Europe. British press tycoon, influential Conservative Party member, and former Minister in Churchill's wartime cabinet, Lord Beaverbrook, recently came forward to fiercely criticize the US and British governments' policies on the German question, demanding that British troops be withdrawn from Germany and Europe. His newspapers believe that signing a separate treaty with West Germany poses a serious danger to Britain and damages Britain's ties with the British Empire. His newspapers emphasized that the danger of West Germany competing with Britain in the world market is becoming increasingly serious.

    Many bourgeois figures in the United States are also afraid that the US government's gambling policy on the German question will have unfortunate consequences. They are worriedly seeing that the "General Treaty" actually deepens the US crisis in Western Europe. A "New York Post" observer said: "For the United States, (the 'General Treaty') means an increase in anti-American sentiment (in Western Europe)." The "Washington Times-Herald" even believes that if the European parliaments refuse to ratify this treaty, the United States can still be spared the misfortune caused by Acheson's recklessness. The famous American reactionary political commentator Lippmann also wrote that West Germany's existing relationship is temporary and not lasting, "We can reasonably be sure that the political future belongs to those who are working to end the division of Germany." That is to say, the United States' insistence on a policy of dividing Germany is detrimental to the United States. American banker Wilbur telegraphed members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requesting that before ratifying the "General Treaty" and permanently dividing Germany, they should thoroughly study the opportunities for negotiations on resolving the German question. American Republican National Committee Defense Issues Advisor, Chicago businessman Brigadier General Klein, also condemned the "General Treaty" after returning to the United States from Western Europe, believing it to be "a serious mistake." Such widespread sentiment in the United States against the "General Treaty" meant that among the thousands of labor unions, churches, and public groups in the United States, not a single one publicly came out in favor of ratifying this war treaty before and after the Senate hurriedly approved this treaty on July 1st.

    西欧和美国的资产阶级舆论对“一般性条约”后果惶惑不安
    【新华社七日讯】在美英法三国与西德傀儡总理阿登纳签订“一般性条约”以后，西欧和美国资产阶级舆论越来越频繁地发出惶惑不安的论调，担心这个条约会给他们造成十分不利的后果。
    “一般性条约”在西欧国家一部分资产阶级人士中引起了极大的震惊。这种情绪明显地反映在他们的报纸上。西欧国家资产阶级报纸看到“一般性条约”遭到德国和西欧绝大多数人民的激烈反对，因而十分怀疑这个条约的稳固性。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“这个条约是和半个德国缔结的，而不是和整个德国缔结的。这不可避免地使它成为靠不住的。”西欧资产阶级不仅害怕西欧人民群众日益壮大的抗议运动，而且还害怕复活后的西德军国主义对他们利益的威胁。“曼彻斯特卫报”说：许多法国人对“一般性条约”感到“不快”，因为“他们害怕德国军队将最后成为欧洲军中最强大的部分，而统治欧洲军”。英国“雷诺新闻”说：西方国家要再次把特罗依的木马（指西德军国主义）引到西欧的中心，这真是一个疯狂的计划。英国报业大王、有势力的保守党人、曾在前邱吉尔战时内阁任大臣的卑维勃鲁克最近也出面激烈批评美英两国政府在德国问题上的政策，要求把英国军队撤出德国和欧洲。他的报纸认为，与西德签订单独条约，就给英国造成了严重的危险，破坏了英国与英帝国之间的联系。他的报纸强调指出：西德在世界市场上与英国竞争的危险越来越严重了。
    美国国内也有许多资产阶级人士害怕美国政府在德国问题上的赌博政策要造成不幸后果。他们忧虑地看到，“一般性条约”实际上加深了美国在西欧的危机。“纽约邮报”观察家说：“对于美国，（‘一般性条约’）就意味着（西欧）反美情绪的增长。”“华盛顿时代先驱报”甚至认为：假如欧洲各国议会拒绝批准这个条约的话，美国倒还能幸免由于艾奇逊的轻率而招致的祸患。著名的美国反动政论家李普曼也写道：西德现有的关系是暂时而且不长久的，“我们可以合理地确信，政治前途属于那些为结束德国分裂状态而努力的人们”。这也就是说，美国坚持分裂德国政策的前途是对美国不利的。美国银行家威尔伯曾打电报给参院外交委员会的委员们，要求在批准“一般性条约”而使德国永远分裂以前，要彻底研究关于解决德国问题的谈判的机会。美国共和党全国委员会国防问题顾问、芝加哥商人克来恩准将自西欧返美后也谴责“一般性条约”，认为这是“一个严重的错误”。在美国反对“一般性条约”的情绪是这样的普遍，参议院在七月一日匆匆批准这个条约的前后，美国几千个工会、教会和公众团体竟没有一个公开出来赞成批准这个战争条约。
