    Correct Attitude towards Further Education
    Liu Shi, Director of the Department of Teacher Education, Ministry of Education, Central People's Government
    This summer vacation, universities and secondary specialized schools across the country will be enrolling a large number of young people. The doors of national universities are open to all graduating high school students, and national secondary specialized schools have greatly increased the number of places available to junior high school graduates. This marks the beginning of a new era in China's secondary and higher education.
    In old China, young people dreamed of being able to choose their own path of development according to their own wishes. Now this dream is beginning to come true. The current task of young people is to transform themselves into various levels and types of professional talents who serve the people, according to the needs and requirements of the country, through diligent study. The great construction of the motherland is calling on young people across the country to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and systematic scientific knowledge and skills, and prepare to quickly step onto the production and cultural and educational fronts. This is something to be proud of for the youth of New China.
    How should young people respond to the call of the motherland and correctly handle the issue of choosing a major?
    Many students have expressed their ideals and fantasies. Some students wrote to me directly: "Should young people in New China have their own ideals and fantasies?" Generally speaking, the answer should be yes. One of the tasks of education in New China is to cultivate lofty ideals and bold fantasies in the younger generation. The problem lies in what you mean by ideals and fantasies. Although "ideal" is a dignified and beautiful word, it is also an abstract concept, and it has always been misused by many mediocre people.
    What kind of ideals should we cultivate in the younger generation?
    The common ideal of the youth of New China should be the ideal of building a great and perfect New China. Under the general goal of gradually completing the construction of New Democracy and moving towards a socialist and communist society, every young person in New China should have their own ideal. This ideal is their goal of struggle and the force that inspires them to move forward. Our revolutionary predecessors had the great ideal and fantasy of creating a new China and liberating their nation and people. They went through arduous struggles to realize this ideal. The emergence of New China is inseparable from their struggle. Our younger generation must have communist ideals and beliefs, systematic knowledge, and bold fantasies, be able to overcome all difficulties, overthrow all outdated conventions, and constantly create new things. This kind of new person has been formed in the flames of revolution over the past thirty years and has continued to emerge on the defense, production, and cultural and educational fronts over the past three years. We ask today's young people to be such new people, to have such ideals and fantasies, and not to be small people who are short-sighted, selfish, and do not know how to serve others. We must draw a clear line between ourselves and such selfish and vulgar thoughts.
    No matter what kind of expert young people prepare to be in the future, they must first have a lofty ideal of building socialism and communism. More specifically, although there are differences in what we study, we should all have the ideal of building an industrialized New China. When considering issues, we cannot start from capitalist principles, such as which major makes more money, has more status, or is more popular. This kind of thinking is not only selfish but also completely outdated. Today, the state cultivates talents in different categories according to the needs of all aspects of national construction. Society needs a division of labor, so a variety of majors have emerged. Otherwise, the machine of the country cannot run smoothly. For example, it is good for young people to volunteer to be engineers, but not all young people can crowd into engineering colleges. If that were the case, the country would have no doctors or teachers. What kind of country would New China be without doctors and teachers? Because society needs such a division of labor, each major occupies its proper place and receives the respect of the country. The state will not, as in capitalist countries, favor one over the other in terms of the wage system, with huge gaps between them. As for social status and development prospects, that does not depend on the nature of the major, but on one's own efforts and one's own work performance. There is an old Chinese saying: "Every profession produces its own leading authority." This saying has really come true today. Haven't many heroes and models emerged in all fields? Choosing a major based on the standards of leisure or hardship, effort or less effort, is a lazy man's idea. There is no major in the world that can be mastered without arduous struggle. If these ideas exist, they will block young people's correct thinking. If a young person spends his energy on issues such as how much money to make, how high the status is, and whether it is popular or not, then what great ideals can he have?
    Secondly, many students have also talked about their future, which is related to the above question. "I volunteer to be an engineer for my future." If someone advises him to be a people's teacher, it is as if he has been deprived of his future. One student told me that in their school, students are discussing what to study to have a future and what has no future. Everyone is confused. These students do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between the individual and the country, and the relationship between the interests of the individual and the interests of hundreds of millions of people. They are still considering the individual's future in isolation, not knowing that today the individual's future must be linked to the country's future. If the country has no future, then what is the individual's future? No matter what major it is, as long as the country needs it, it has a future. Isn't the question very simple?
    One student asked: "I obey the organization's assignment, and I will study whatever the organization wants me to study." Is this statement correct? This attitude is correct, but at the same time, the problem must be solved ideologically. If one outwardly "obeys the organization's assignment" but still has many knots in his mind, then he cannot be considered to have truly obeyed the organization's assignment.
    The country needs to cultivate talents in many fields, but each person can mainly only study one. The country needs people with different personalities, different aspirations, and different conditions, and hopes that everyone can give full play to their strengths. The problem lies in what position you stand on and from whose interests you consider this issue. You should stand on the position of the people and consider how to give full play to your strengths from the actual needs of the country. If you deviate from the needs of the country and simply start from "personal interest" or "personal future," and inappropriately emphasize your "strengths," then you will often "not be able to figure it out," and even if you outwardly obey the organization's assignment, the problem has not been truly solved ideologically.
    On the other hand, many Chinese youths' "interests" and "strengths" are actually not very clear. Many students have told me that their ambitions are uncertain. After listening to a report from a hydraulic engineer, many people want to study hydraulic engineering; after watching a performance by a famous cultural troupe, they want to be musicians, playwrights, and stage workers. This shows that the learning direction of many young people today is not fixed, and the range of majors to choose from is very broad. It is not very well-founded for these people to emphasize their individuality and not want to study this or that major.
    If the above questions are answered correctly ideologically, I believe that young people will be able to handle the issue of choosing a major correctly.
    Currently, many incorrect positions and views are very concentratedly reflected in the youth's indifferent attitude towards applying for normal colleges and normal schools. Last year, some normal colleges and normal schools did not meet their enrollment quotas. This year, the enrollment quota has been greatly expanded. If the youth do not change their attitude, it will be a major event related to the entire construction of the country. This deserves the attention of all progressive youth.
    What is preventing young people from entering normal colleges or normal schools with the same excitement as Soviet high school graduates?
    This is mainly because young people have been influenced by harmful traditional views on the teaching profession. In old China, education was not valued, teachers had no status in society, and their pay was low. This created a general psychology in society: "This line of work has no future." Teachers themselves also developed a sense of inferiority, forced to make a living while complaining and being dissatisfied with their profession. Although the status of education in national construction has undergone fundamental changes, it is impossible for the situation of teachers' difficult lives to become satisfactory for a while. In this transitional period, this influence is not easy to eliminate quickly. In addition, the rapid progress of the current national construction cause requires young people everywhere, and there are many ways out for young people. Many negative influences have been transmitted from families, society, and even some school teachers, causing young people to be afraid of this profession. Young people do not consider the position of this profession in New China, and they do not understand the content of this profession. Young people must recognize that this profession (teacher education) occupies a position in the educational cause of New China as important as heavy industry in industry. It determines the development of all general education and people's culture, and it is related to the future of industrial construction and the future destiny of the country. What schools want to cultivate is a soul engineer, a person with noble qualities who can set an example for others. The major of teacher education is by no means as impoverished as it was in the past; it has extremely rich content. Because this major is extremely inclusive, many people with different learning interests can develop here. There is a reason why Soviet youth consider it the greatest honor to strive to study this major. Young people must recognize that this is a path to fully develop your intelligence and talents.
    Because teacher education occupies an important position in the current national construction, the government has used its greatest strength to build people's teacher education worthy of the name, improve the quality of teaching, and fully meet the needs of students. Similarly, the government is also using its greatest strength to systematically and gradually improve the material lives of teachers at all levels, solve their learning problems, improve their social status, and create a social atmosphere of respect for teachers. Young people should look further ahead. The honor and lofty status enjoyed by Soviet teachers today is our vision for the future. I hope that all progressive students will carry out mutual criticism and persuasion on all incorrect thoughts about applying for normal colleges or normal schools, launch debates, and seriously refute all traditional ideas that despise teacher education.
    Young people must use the spirit of patriotism to ensure the completion of this year's enrollment plans for national universities and specialized secondary schools.

    端正升学态度
    中央人民政府教育部师范教育司司长  柳湜
    今年暑假，全国高等学校和中等专业学校将吸收大量青年入学。全国高等学校的门是向着全体高中毕业同学敞开的，全国各种中等专业学校也为广大的初中毕业同学大大地增加了名额。这是新中国中等以上教育开始进入新时期的标志。
    在旧中国，青年们曾梦想着能够按自己的志愿，选择自己发展的道路。现在这一梦想开始实现了。当前青年的任务是通过认真的学习，把自己按照国家的需要和要求，造就成为人民服务的各种、各级的专业人才。祖国伟大的建设在召唤全国青年起来，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装自己，用系统的各种科学知识与技能武装自己，准备迅速地走上生产战线和文教战线上去。这是新中国青年值得骄傲的事。
    青年们应该怎样回答祖国的号召，怎样正确地处理自己选择专业学习这一问题呢？
    很多同学都提出了自己的理想和幻想。有几个同学直接写信给我：“新中国青年应不应有自己的理想和幻想？”一般说来，回答应该是肯定的。新中国教育的任务之一，就是要为青年一代培养远大的理想和勇敢的幻想。问题在于你所抱的理想和幻想是指的什么。因为理想虽然是一个尊严而又美丽的名词，但同时它却是一个抽象的概念，并且它一向曾被许多庸人滥用了。
    我们要为青年一代培养的理想是什么呢？
    新中国青年的共同理想，应该是建设伟大、完美的新中国的理想。在逐步完成新民主主义的建设，从而向社会主义、共产主义社会迈进的总目标下，新中国的每个青年都应该有自己的理想。这种理想就是他们的奋斗目标，是鼓舞他们不断前进的力量。我们的革命先辈们都抱有伟大的创造新中国、解放自己的民族和人民的理想和幻想。他们为了这一理想的实现曾经历了艰苦卓绝的奋斗。新中国的出现，是跟他们的奋斗分不开的。我们的青年一代必须抱有共产主义的理想和信念，有系统的知识，有勇敢的幻想，能够克服一切困难，推翻一切过时的陈规，不断地创造新鲜事物。这种新的人物，近三十年来，在革命的烈火中形成起来了，近三年来，又在国防、生产、文教战线上不断地出现了。我们要求今天的青年们都做这样的新人物，抱有这样的理想和幻想，而不要再做那些鼠目寸光，只知为己，不知为人的小人物。我们必须和那种自私自利的庸俗思想划清界限。
    青年们无论准备将来做那一种专家，首先要有一个建设社会主义、共产主义的远大的理想。更具体地说，我们学习的方面尽管有差别，但都应该有一个建设工业化的新中国的理想。我们在考虑问题时，不能从资本主义的原则出发，如那一种专业赚钱更多，更有地位，更吃香等。这种想法不仅是自私自利，而且也完全过时了。今天国家分门别类的培养人才，是按国家建设各方面的需要。社会是需要分工的，因此出现了多种多样的专业，不如此，国家这一个机器就不能转动自如。譬如青年志愿做一个工程师是好的，但不能全体青年都拥挤到工学院，果如此，国家就会没有医生和教师了。新中国如果没有医生和教师，那还成一个什么样子的国家呢？由于社会需要如此分工，各专业就各占有应占的地位，取得国家的尊重。国家在工资制度方面，也不会像资本主义国家一样，轻此重彼，相隔悬殊。至于社会地位和发展前途，那并不决定于这一专业的性质，而决定于自己的努力，决定于自己的工作成绩。中国有一句老话：“行行出状元”，这一句话现在真的实现了。不是各方面都出现了许多英雄、模范么？根据清闲或艰苦，费力多或费力少的标准来选择专业，那是一种懒汉的思想，世界上没有那一种专业不经过艰苦奋斗可以精通的。以上这些思想如果存在，就会阻塞青年们正确的思考。一个青年如果把自己的精力耗费在赚钱多少、地位高低、吃香不吃香等问题上，那还能有什么伟大理想呢？
    其次，也有许多同学谈到自己的前途问题，这和上面一个问题是相联系的。“我志愿做工程师是为了我的前途”，如果有人劝他做人民教师，就好像夺去了他的前途似的。有一个同学告诉我，在他们学校里，同学们纷纷在议论，学什么才有前途，什么没有前途。大家都弄得糊涂起来。这些同学对于个人和国家的关系，个人的利益和亿万人民的利益的关系，是没有正确认识的。他们还在孤立地考虑个人的前途，殊不知今天个人的前途，必须和国家的前途联系起来，如果国家没有前途，那还有什么个人的前途呢？不管那一门专业，只要国家需要，都有前途。问题不是很简单的么？
    有一个同学提出：“我服从组织分配，组织要我学什么就学什么”。这种说法对不对呢？这种态度是对的，但同时必须在思想上解决问题。如果表面上“服从组织分配”，而思想上还有许多疙瘩，那还不能算是真正服从组织分配。
    国家需要培养的人才是多方面的，但每一个人主要只能学一门。国家需要具有不同个性、不同愿望、不同条件的人，希望每一个人能充分发挥他的特长。问题在于你站在什么立场上，从什么利益出发考虑这个问题。应该站在人民的立场，从当前国家的实际需要出发，来考虑怎样才能充分发挥自己的特长。如果离开国家的需要，单纯从“个人兴趣”或“个人前途”出发，不适当地强调自己的“特长”，那就往往“想不通”，即使在表面上服从组织分配，在思想上并没有真正解决问题。
    在另一方面，中国许多青年的“兴趣”和“特长”实际上并不是十分明确的。很多同学告诉我，他们的志向是不定的。在听了一个水利工程师的报告后，很多人就想学水利工程科；看了一个有名的文工团的演出，又想当音乐家，戏剧家，舞台工作者。这说明了今天许多青年的学习方向，并未固定，选择专业的范围是非常宽广的。这些人强调个性，不愿学这一专业，或那一专业，那是没有多大根据的。
    以上这几个问题如果在思想上得到正确的解答，我相信，青年们对选择专业学习这一问题是能够得到正确的处理的。
    目前许多不正确的立场和观点，很集中地表现在青年们对投考师范学院和师范学校的冷淡态度上。去年有些师范学院、师范学校招生是未满额的，今年，招生名额大大的扩大了，如果青年们不改变态度，那是一件关系国家整个建设的大事。这值得一切进步的青年注意。
    什么东西阻碍着青年们不能像苏联的中学毕业生一样兴高彩烈地走进师范学院或师范学校呢？
    这主要是因为青年们受了对教师这一专业的有害的传统观点的影响。旧中国对教育不重视，教师在社会上无地位，报酬低等等，在社会上造成了一种普遍的心理：“这一行没干头”。教师本人也产生了一种自卑感，一面为生活所迫，勉强在混饭吃，一面在怨天怨地，不安其业。现在教育事业在国家建设中的地位虽然已有了根本的改变，但教师生活艰苦的情况，还不可能一时变得尽如人意。在这过渡时期，这种影响是不易很快消灭的。加上当前国家建设事业突飞猛进，到处需要青年，青年出路多，又从家庭、社会，甚至某些学校教师方面传染了许多不良影响，使青年人对这一专业见而生畏了。青年们不去考虑这一专业在新中国的地位，不去了解这一专业的内容。青年们要认识：这一专业（师范教育），在新中国教育事业中所占的地位，如同工业中的重工业一样。它决定全部普通教育和人民文化的发展，关系到工业建设的前途和国家未来的命运。学校要培养的是一种灵魂的工程师，一种具有高尚品质，能为人表率的人物。师范教育这一专业，绝不像过去那样贫乏，它有极丰富的内容。因为这一专业极富包容性，所以许多不同学习兴趣的人都可以在这里得到发展。苏联青年以争取学习这一专业为最大的光荣，那不是没有理由的。青年必须认识：这是一条充分发展你的智慧与才能的道路。
    由于师范教育在当前国家建设中占重要地位，政府已用最大力量，要建设名符其实的人民的师范教育，提高教学的质量，充分满足学生的要求。同样，政府也在用最大的力量，有计划地、逐步地改善各级教师的物质生活，解决他们的学习问题，提高其社会地位，并在社会上造成尊重教师的风气。青年们应该看远一点，今天苏联的教师所享受的荣誉和崇高的地位，就是我们的远景。我希望一切进步的同学对投考师范学院或师范学校的一切不正确的思想，开展互相批评和说服的工作，开展论争，严肃地驳斥一切轻视师范教育的传统思想。
    青年们必须用爱国主义的精神，来保证完成今年全国高等学校，各专业性的中等学校的招生计划。
