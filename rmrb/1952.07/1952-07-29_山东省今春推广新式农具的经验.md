    Shandong Province's Experience in Promoting New Agricultural Implements This Spring
    Yang Maowu
    This spring, agricultural implement stations and cooperatives at all levels in Shandong, in coordination with the patriotic increase production campaign, promoted a large number of new agricultural implements. Among them, 3,738 new-style walking plows alone were promoted. By early May, Laiyang Prefecture had promoted more than 870 new-style walking plows, and Wendeng Prefecture had promoted more than 1,000, both exceeding their original targets.
    Pay Attention to Imparting the Technology of Using New Agricultural Implements
    This spring, when carrying out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work on the use of new agricultural implements, agricultural implement stations and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong trained a large number of cadres from grassroots cooperatives, prefectural farms, and county farms, extension cadres from the construction section, production cadres from districts and townships, and mutual aid team leaders, model workers, and activists among farmers, enabling many people to truly master the technology of using new agricultural implements. The Laiyang Agricultural Implement Station trained more than 1,000 people in March and April, and the Tai'an Agricultural Implement Station trained more than 1,600 people; these people then passed on the technology to the masses of farmers. Farmers who purchased new-style walking plows and had experience using them all said: the new-style walking plow is light, fast, plows deep, and plows well, and can indeed increase grain production. However, the masses also generally reflected: "New agricultural implements are good, but you also have to know how to use them." This shows that the masses' demand for technology is just as urgent as their demand for new agricultural implements. Xu Shouxiang, a labor model from Dazhuangzi Village, Huangbu Township, Weixian County, bought a 7-inch walking plow last autumn, but because he didn't know how to use it, the results were not good after two days of trial use. On the first morning, the masses went to visit, but they never went again. Some even ridiculed him, saying, "You spent more than 300,000 yuan just to buy a big sign." (There was a sign on the plow beam that said "Made by North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory"). Members of the same mutual aid team and even his own wife complained about him, which made him very depressed at the time. However, he believed in the government and believed that the new-style plow must be good, so he continued to try patiently. After receiving help from comrades in the district and the agricultural implement station, he finally learned how to use it. After Xu Shouxiang's mutual aid team bought a new-style walking plow, Xu Shouxiang constantly studied the technology and passed it on to everyone. All the team members, including Xu Guanglie, who was sixty-two years old (and was originally a semi-laborer who could not use the old plow), could use the new agricultural implements. Last winter, most of the land in their team was cultivated with the new-style walking plow, and they also spared time to cultivate land for the masses in the same village, earning more than 500,000 yuan in wages, which further increased the team's income. The fact that Xu Shouxiang and his mutual aid team used the new-style walking plow educated the masses in the whole village and made them realize the benefits of the new agricultural implements. Three mutual aid teams in the whole village all used the new-style walking plow. This fact shows that in the work of promoting new agricultural implements, it is very important to simultaneously impart and popularize technology. Some areas have not paid due attention to this point, which is not right.
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Agricultural Implement Stations Should Cooperate Closely
    Shandong has had more than two years of history in promoting new agricultural implements. Before this spring, this work was originally controlled professionally by agricultural implement stations. Starting this spring, agricultural implement stations are specifically responsible for technical guidance and experimentation, while promotion business is controlled by supply and marketing cooperatives. Such a shift has created more favorable conditions for the large-scale promotion of new agricultural implements in the future. Now, the institutions of supply and marketing cooperatives have become popular throughout the country, and their grassroots societies have established close relations with the broad masses of farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives are more familiar with the rural economic situation and agricultural production situation, and can deeply understand the real needs of farmers and supply them in a timely manner. It is easy for cooperatives to exchange goods for goods when promoting new agricultural implements, which is not only conducive to the cooperative's purchasing work, but also can solve the difficulty of some farmers purchasing new agricultural implements with cash, and simplify the purchase procedures for farmers. Therefore, in Shandong Province, where the promotion of new agricultural implements has already gained a preliminary foundation, it is completely correct and necessary to hand over the promotion business to the cooperatives this year. In order to better transfer the promotion business of agricultural implement stations to cooperatives, attention should be paid to the following points: 1. The agricultural department, especially the agricultural implement station, must systematically and in detail introduce the promotion experience of the past two years to the cooperative department, so that the cooperative knows which experiences can be learned and continued to be carried forward, and those problems that have occurred in the past should be paid attention to solving and trying to avoid. 2. The agricultural implement station must introduce as much basic knowledge as possible about promoting new agricultural implements to the personnel of the cooperative engaged in promotion work. 3. The agricultural and cooperative departments must jointly formulate promotion plans; and regularly study the work and strengthen business contacts. 4. The agricultural implement station should assist the cooperative in training technical cadres to popularize technical guidance work. 5. The agricultural implement station should assist the cooperative in investigating and understanding the farmers' use of new agricultural implements at any time, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. In addition, the cooperative must supply new agricultural implements in a timely manner, do a good job in allocation, and overcome the shortcomings of equal distribution. The agricultural implement station should do a good job in the experiment and identification of agricultural implements.
    Organized Farmers are the Main Target for Promoting New Agricultural Implements
    This spring, all the cultivated land of more than 140 state-owned farms in Shandong Province used new-style walking plows. In addition to the 7-inch walking plow, there were also 10-inch walking plows and double-wheel double-moldboard plows. Most farms used weeding hoes. The requirement that state-owned farms use new-style agricultural implements across the board has been fully met. More than 90% of the new agricultural implements promoted among the masses of farmers—more than 3,700 walking plows—were handed over to organized advanced farmers (of which Laiyang Prefecture handed them over 100% to farmers' cooperative mutual aid organizations). Because state-owned farms and advanced cooperative mutual aid organizations among farmers first used new agricultural implements, this promoted many individual farmers to organize, and they also requested to purchase new agricultural implements. This spring, Changwei Prefecture promoted more than 300 new-style walking plows, of which 7.5% of the promotion targets were newly organized mutual aid teams. After the farmers were organized, their awareness and enthusiasm for production increased day by day, their productivity developed, and their purchasing power also increased. Therefore, it is completely correct to promote new agricultural implements with organized farmers as the main target. After the farmers are organized, with various new means of production as a material basis, it is easy to consolidate and improve mutual aid organizations. However, in order to facilitate capital turnover, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong mainly adopt the method of cash sales to supply new agricultural implements. At present, most of the farmers have just begun to organize, and their economic conditions are not very good, especially some mutual aid teams that are completely organized by poor and hired farmers, who lack sufficient economic strength. If they want to completely adopt the method of cash purchase for the various new means of production they urgently need, they will have difficulties. The Zhang Weishan Mutual Aid Team in Xiaobaixi Village, Baixi Township, Si'chuan County, has a total of nine households, all of whom are poor farmers. In the past, they only had a small cart and a seeder. This spring, they planned to add a Liberation-style waterwheel and a 7-inch walking plow, but because their economic ability was not enough, they did not achieve their goals. Therefore, at present, in the work of promoting new agricultural implements, in addition to mobilizing farmers to save unnecessary money and materials to purchase means of production and turn dead money into living money, we should also adopt methods such as barter, short-term loans, and credit purchases to appropriately take care of the specific difficulties of some farmers.
    New Agricultural Implements Should Be Supplied in a Timely Manner According to the Specific Conditions of Various Places
    The supply of new agricultural implements must be based on the specific conditions of various places, and cannot be equally distributed; and it must be supplied in a timely manner according to the agricultural season. This spring, most areas in Shandong supplied new agricultural implements in a timely manner according to the specific needs. However, in some areas, there are still phenomena of equal distribution and insufficient and untimely supply. For example, in the cotton-producing area of Dezhou Prefecture, because it is not very suitable to use a 7-inch walking plow to cultivate the second crop in spring, not even one 7-inch walking plow was promoted there. However, in Wendeng and Laiyang Prefectures, where farmers have a large demand for 7-inch walking plows, they feel that the supply cannot keep up. Under such circumstances, some iron factories in Wendeng and Laiyang initially imitated walking plows and promoted them. As a result, some of the materials were not good and the specifications were not correct, and the masses could not use them, which hindered the promotion work.

    山东省今春推广新式农具的经验
    杨茂武
    今年春季，山东各地农具站和各级合作社配合爱国增产运动，推广了大批新式农具。其中仅新式步犁就推广了三千七百三十八部。到五月初旬为止，莱阳专区推广新式步犁八百七十多部，文登专区推广新式步犁一千部以上，都超过了原定的任务。
    要注意传授使用新农具的技术
    今春山东各地农具站和各级供销合作社在进行广泛深入的关于使用新式农具的宣传教育工作的时候，都训练了大批基层合作社、专区农场、县农场的干部，建设科的推广干部，区、乡的生产干部和农民中的互助组长、劳动模范和积极分子，使许多群众真正掌握了使用新式农具的技术。莱阳农具站在三、四月份内训练了一千多人，泰安农具站训练了一千六百多人；经过这些人再把技术传授给农民群众。购得新式步犁并且有了使用经验的农民都说：新式步犁轻、快，耕得深，耕得好，的确能够增产粮食。但是，群众也普遍反映：“新式农具好是好，也得会使。”这就说明了群众要求技术和要求新式农具是同样迫切的。潍县一区黄埠乡大庄子村劳动模范徐守祥在去年秋季买了一部七吋步犁，因为不会使用，试用了两天成绩都不好。第一天上午群众还去参观，以后再也不去了。有的还讽刺他说：“你花了三十几万块钱，就买了一个大牌子。”（犁辕上面有一个“华北农业机械总厂造”的牌子）。同一互助组的组员和他自己的妻子也都抱怨他，弄得他当时非常愁闷。但是，他相信政府，相信新式犁一定是好的，所以仍然耐心地试用。他在得到区和农具站的同志的帮助以后，终于学会了使用的方法。徐守祥互助组买了新式步犁，徐守祥不断钻研技术，并把技术传授给大家。全体组员连六十二岁的徐光烈（本来是个半劳动力，使不了旧犁）也都能使用新农具了。去年冬天，他们全组大部分土地，是用新式步犁耕作的，他们还匀出了时间给同村群众代耕，赚得工资五十多万元，更增加了全组的收入。徐守祥和他的互助组使用新式步犁的事实，教育了全村群众，使他们认识了新式农具的好处。全村三个互助组，都使用了新式步犁。这一事实，说明了在推广新式农具的工作中，同时传授和普及技术是十分重要的。某些地区对这一点还没有引起应有的重视，是不对的。
    供销合作社和农具站应该密切配合
    山东推广新式农具，已经有了两年多的历史。在今春以前，这一工作，原由农具站专业掌握。从今年春季开始，农具站专门负责技术指导和试验等工作，推广业务由供销合作社负责掌握。这样的一个转变，为今后大批推广新式农具创造了更有利的条件。现在供销合作社的机构已经普及各地，它的基层社已经和广大农民建立了密切的关系。供销合作社对于农村经济情况和农业生产情况都比较熟悉，它能深入了解农民的真实需要情况及时地予以供应。合作社推广新式农具，容易作到以物易物的实物交换，不仅有利于合作社的收购工作，而且可以解决部分农民现款购买新式农具的困难，并使农民购买手续也随之简化。因此，在新式农具推广工作业已获得初步基础的山东省，今年把推广业务交由合作社掌握，是完全正确而且必要的。为了更好地把农具站的推广业务转移给合作社，应注意以下几点：1、农业部门，尤其是农具站，须把两年多来的推广经验，系统地详细地介绍给合作部门，使合作社知道那些经验可以吸取和继续发扬，过去发生过的那些问题要注意解决和设法避免。2、农具站须把推广新式农具的一切基本知识，尽量介绍给合作社从事推广工作的人员。3、农业和合作部门必须共同制定推广计划；并经常研究工作，加强业务联系。4、农具站应协助合作社训练技术干部，以普及技术指导工作。5、农具站应协助合作社随时调查了解农民使用新农具的情况，及时发现和解决问题。此外，合作社须及时供应新农具，做好调拨工作，克服平均分配的缺点。农具站则应做好农具的试验、鉴定等工作。
    组织起来的农民是推广新农具的主要对象
    今春山东全省一百四十多个国营农场的全部耕地都使用了新式步犁。除了七吋步犁外，还有十吋步犁、双轮双铧犁。大部分农场使用了耘锄。国营农场一律使用新式农具的要求已经完全达到了。在农民群众中所推广的新式农具——三千七百多部步犁，百分之九十以上交给了组织起来的先进农民（其中莱阳专区是百分之百地交给了农民的合作互助组织）。由于国营农场和农民中先进的合作互助组织首先使用了新农具，这就推动了不少单干农民组织起来，他们也要求购用新式农具。昌潍专区今春推广了三百多部新式步犁，其中，百分之七点五的推广对象是新组织起来的互助组。农民组织起来以后，觉悟程度和生产积极性日益提高，他们的生产力发展了，购买力也提高了，因此，以组织起来的农民为主要对象推广新式农具，是完全正确的。农民组织起来以后，有了各种新的生产资料作为物质基础，互助组织就容易巩固和提高。但是山东各地供销合作社为了便于资金周转，供应新式农具，主要是采取现售的方式。而目前农民大部分还是刚刚开始组织起来，经济条件还不很好，特别是有些完全由贫、雇农组织的互助组，更缺乏足够的经济力量，对于他们所迫切需要的各种新的生产资料，如果要完全采取现款购买的办法，他们是有困难的。淄川县四区百锡乡小百锡村张维山互助组，共有九户，完全是贫农，过去只有一辆小车，一把耩子，今年春季计划增添解放式水车和七吋步犁各一部，就因为经济能力不够，都没有达到目的。因此，目前在新式农具推广工作中，除了动员农民节约不急需的款物购买生产资料，变死财为活财之外，还应采用实物交换，短期贷放和赊购等办法，适当地照顾某些农民的具体困难。
    应按各地具体情况及时供应新农具
    供应新式农具必须根据各地具体情况，不能平均分配；而且要按照农时及时供应。今春山东大部分地区是按照需要的具体情况，及时供应了新式农具。但是，在某些地区还有平均分配和供应不够及时的现象。如德州专区的棉产区，因为用七吋步犁在春季耕第二遍地不太合适，当地的七吋步犁连一部也没有推广出去。而文登、莱阳两个专区，农民大量需要七吋步犁，则又感到供应不上。在这样情况之下，文登、莱阳有些铁工厂初步仿造了步犁，进行了推广。结果，有的质料不好规格不对，群众没法使用，反而妨碍推广工作。
