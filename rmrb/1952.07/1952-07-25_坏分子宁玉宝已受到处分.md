Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Bad Element Ning Yubao Has Been Punished
    Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published the article "The Leading Organs of Penglai County Should Deal with the Bad Element Ning Yubao" in the "Readers' Letters" column on May 21, the Penglai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Penglai County People's Government immediately began to handle the matter. They recently sent a letter to our newspaper informing us of the results of the handling. The following is a summary of the letter:
    Comrade Editor: We had an erroneous idea when dealing with the Ning Yubao issue, which was to wait until after the rural party rectification to deal with such issues, and therefore adopted a delaying and perfunctory attitude towards the Ning Yubao issue. This shows that there is still serious bureaucratism in our work, and we are not responsible enough for the affairs of the people.
    Ning Yubao did not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, shielded the counter-revolutionary element Ning Yupuo, and lost his position. He led the masses in gambling, affecting production; and illegally detained Communist Party member Ning Wenyong and the masses Ning Yuji. He himself did not work, but hired long-term laborers to cultivate the land, fostering a strong exploitative class ideology. This shows that he has completely degenerated and lost the qualifications of a Communist Party member. Therefore, it was decided to give him the punishment of expulsion from the Party and recommend that the government give him criminal punishment.
                Penglai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Comrade Editor: After the Penglai County People's Government saw the People's Daily exposing the Ning Yubao issue, it immediately sent court cadres to investigate and confirmed that Ning Yubao had the following errors:
    1. Sheltering the counter-revolutionary element Ning Yupuo and accepting his bribes, seriously losing his class position. 2. Being a rogue by nature, leading gambling, so that many peasants were forced to sell their fields and land, affecting production. 3. Deliberately retaliating, illegally detaining cadres and the masses. Now the government has decided to give him a sentence of six months imprisonment.
                Penglai County People's Government

### 坏分子宁玉宝已受到处分

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    坏分子宁玉宝已受到处分
    编者按：本报五月二十一日“读者来信”栏内发表了“蓬莱县领导机关应处理坏分子宁玉宝”一文后，中共蓬莱县委及蓬莱县人民政府立即着手处理这一问题。最近他们给本报来信告知处理结果，现将来信摘要发表如下：
    编辑同志：我们在处理宁玉宝问题时存在着一个错误思想，就是想等到农村整党后来处理这类问题，因而对宁玉宝的问题采取了拖延应付的态度。这说明我们的工作上还存在着严重的官僚主义，对人民群众的事情不够负责。
    宁玉宝敌我不分，包庇反革命分子宁玉璞，丧失立场。他领导群众赌博，影响生产；并非法扣押共产党员宁文永和群众宁玉玑。他自己不劳动，雇长工耕种，滋长了浓厚的剥削阶级思想。这说明他已完全蜕化变质，丧失了共产党员的条件，因此决定给以开除党籍的处分，并建议政府给以刑事处分。
                中共蓬莱县委员会
    编辑同志：蓬莱县人民政府在看到人民日报揭发宁玉宝的问题后，当即派法院干部进行调查，证实宁玉宝有以下错误：
    一、包庇反革命分子宁玉璞，并接受其贿赂，严重丧失阶级立场。二、流氓成性，领导赌博，以致许多农民被逼得卖田卖地，影响了生产。三、蓄意报复，非法扣押干部、群众。现在政府已决定给以有期徒刑六个月的处分。
                蓬莱县人民政府
