Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: TASS reports: Maher has been reappointed as the Egyptian Prime Minister and has formed his “extraordinary cabinet.” He himself holds important positions such as Minister of the Army and Navy, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of the Interior. It is known that Maher served as Prime Minister at the beginning of this year. Foreign newspapers point out that his administration was decided after "consultations" with American diplomats. The aim of the American diplomats is to drag Egypt into the aggressive "Middle East Command." Maher met with the US Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, for this matter.

Note: Since Hilali resigned as the Egyptian Prime Minister on June 28th, Siri organized a new government. However, on July 21st, Siri resigned again, and Hilali was reappointed as Prime Minister. Only one day after Hilali took office, the Egyptian army, under the leadership of General Naguib, launched a coup, occupied Cairo, and forced Hilali to resign on the 23rd. Maher's return to organize a new government was with Naguib's consent. Egypt's volatile political situation shows that the United States has intensified its plans for aggression in the Middle East, and also shows that the contradictions between Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly acute.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: TASS reports: French radio broadcasts that Egyptian King Farouk left Egypt on the 26th, leaving the country from Alexandria on his own ship. It is said that Farouk is going to the United States.

According to Cairo Radio, Farouk abdicated at the request of General Naguib, the leader of this coup. Naguib wanted the King to abdicate and leave Egypt before 6 pm on the 26th.

London Radio reported that Maher met with King Farouk twice on the 26th, and met with General Naguib after each meeting. Maher also met with the US Ambassador to Egypt.

    马赫尔重新出任埃及首相
    埃及国王法鲁克退位赴美
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：马赫尔已重新出任埃及首相，组成了他的“非常内阁”。他自己担任了陆军及海军大臣、外交大臣、内政大臣等重要职务。大家知道，马赫尔曾在今年年初担任过首相。外国报纸指出：他的执政是和美国外交人员作过“协商”后决定的。美国外交人员的目的是要把埃及拖进侵略性的“中东司令部”去。马赫尔曾为此事和美国驻埃及大使加佛利会晤。
    按：自希拉里在六月二十八日辞去埃及首相职务以后，即由西里组织新政府。但到七月二十一日，西里又告辞职，由希拉里重新出任首相。希拉里上台不过一天，埃及陆军就在纳吉布将军领导下发动政变，占领了开罗，迫使希拉里在二十三日辞职。马赫尔重新出来组织新政府，是得到纳吉布的同意的。埃及多变的政治局势，说明美国已加紧实施对中东的侵略计划，也说明英美之间的矛盾日趋尖锐。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社讯：法国电台广播，埃及国王法鲁克已于二十六日离开埃及，乘他自己的船从亚历山大离国。据说，法鲁克前往美国。
    据开罗电台称，法鲁克是在这次政变的领导者纳吉布将军的要求下退位的。纳吉布要国王退位，并要他于二十六日下午六时以前离开埃及。
    伦敦电台报道，马赫尔在二十六日曾两度会见国王法鲁克，每次会见以后又和纳吉布将军会晤。马赫尔同时和美国驻埃及大使会见。
