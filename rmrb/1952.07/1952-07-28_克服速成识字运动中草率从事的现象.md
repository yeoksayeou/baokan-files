A Brief Comment on Cultural Life

    The rapid literacy campaign has been gradually unfolding nationwide. Major administrative regions and many provinces and cities have generally formulated steps and plans for comprehensive promotion, launched publicity, mobilization, and organization work, and some places have already entered the stage of large-scale trials, achieving remarkable results.
    Local experiences prove that to universally carry out the rapid literacy campaign, we must adopt the principle of proceeding from point to area and advancing steadily. The more thorough the plan, the more sufficient the preparations, and the steadier the pace, the more likely we are to achieve the goal of "rapid literacy"; otherwise, we will get the opposite result.
    According to materials from various places, some regions, industrial systems, or units have experienced hasty practices due to the blindly optimistic sentiments of leading cadres. Some have launched comprehensive promotion without pilot projects, some have hastily organized students to study without first conscientiously training teachers, and some students have been asked to cram new characters before they have learned phonetic symbols or pinyin. Some teachers lack a realistic spirit, pursue novelty, deviate from the basic spirit of the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method, and advocate abolishing phonetic symbols and replacing them with homophones, resulting in confusion between phonetic characters and new characters. All these are because leading cadres and teachers do not understand that rapid literacy education is a very intense and meticulous work, requiring a high degree of responsibility and a realistic working attitude; they do not understand that the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method is a complete rapid literacy teaching method developed through countless experiments. We should only supplement it with new experiences on its basis to further improve it, and should not arbitrarily destroy it. Any hasty approach will inevitably affect the smooth progress of the movement.
    Leading cadres in various regions and units should first earnestly study the rapid literacy method, understand its spirit and essence, understand its characteristics, and master its teaching steps and methods; secondly, they must formulate specific plans based on the actual conditions of their region or unit and proceed in an orderly manner. According to the experience of some regions, the central key to carrying out the rapid literacy campaign lies in the training of teachers, and the work of training teachers must be combined with "pilot" work, so that teachers can acquire the necessary knowledge about rapid literacy teaching in the classroom while gaining experience in actual teaching work, unifying their teaching and learning process. Teachers trained in this way can confidently carry out teaching work and effectively promote the rapid development of the rapid literacy movement from point to area. This experience should be fully valued by all localities.
    The rapid literacy method is a powerful weapon for universally carrying out the rapid literacy campaign and quickly eliminating illiteracy, but it can only play its due great role when combined with the high sense of responsibility, realistic working attitude, and methods adapted to local conditions of relevant leading cadres and the vast number of rapid literacy educators.

### 克服速成识字运动中草率从事的现象

    克服速成识字运动中草率从事的现象
    速成识字运动已在全国范围内逐步展开了。大行政区和许多省市一般地都订出了全面推广的步骤和计划，展开了宣传、动员和组织工作，有些地方已经进入大规模试行的阶段，取得了显著的成绩。
    各地经验证明：要普遍开展速成识字运动，必须采取由点到面、稳步前进的方针。计划越周密，准备工作越充分，步调越稳，则越能达到“速成识字”的目的，否则就会得到相反的结果。
    根据各地的材料，有些地区、产业系统或单位，因为领导干部有盲目乐观情绪，发生了草率从事的现象。有的不经过试点工作便全面推广，有的不先认真训练师资，便匆忙地组织学员学习，有的学员还没有学会注音符号或拼音，便要他们突击生字。有些教师缺乏实事求是的精神，标新立异，脱离祁建华速成识字法的基本精神，主张废除注音符号，而用同音字来代替，结果注音字和生字往往混淆不清。这些都因为领导干部和教师不懂得速成识字教育工作是非常紧张而细致的工作，需要高度的负责精神和实事求是的工作态度；他们不懂得祁建华速成识字法是在无数次实验中发展起来的一套完整的速成识字教学法。我们只应该在它的基础上，用新的经验来补充它，进一步提高它，不应该任意加以破坏。任何草率的作法，都必然要影响运动的顺利开展。
    各地区各单位的领导干部首先应该认真研究速成识字法，领会其精神和实质，了解其特点，掌握其教学步骤和教学方法；其次必须根据本地区本单位的实际情况，订出具体计划，循序前进。根据某些地区的经验，开展速成识字运动的中心关键在于师资的训练，而训练师资的工作又必须跟“试点”工作结合起来，使教师们一边在课堂里获得关于速成识字教学的必要知识，一边到实际教学工作中去取得经验，使他们的教和学的过程统一起来。这样锻炼出来的教师，能够有把握地进行教学工作，有效地推动速成识字运动由点到面的迅速发展。这一经验应该受到各地的充分重视。
    速成识字法是普遍开展速成识字运动、迅速扫除文盲的有力武器，但只有跟各地有关领导干部和广大的速成识字教育工作者的高度负责精神、实事求是的工作态度和因地制宜的工作方法结合起来，它才能发挥应有的伟大作用。
