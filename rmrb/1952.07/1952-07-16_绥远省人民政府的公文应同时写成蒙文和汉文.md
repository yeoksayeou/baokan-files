    The People's Government of Suiyuan Province Should Write Official Documents in Both Mongolian and Chinese
    Many district and village cadres in Otog Banner and other banners of the Ikezhao League Autonomous Region in Suiyuan Province are of Mongolian ethnicity. Most of these cadres do not recognize Chinese characters. However, more than 70% of the documents issued by the higher-level government are written in Chinese. In order to maintain confidentiality, these cadres dare not easily ask outsiders to read the documents, which has caused great losses to the work. In 1951, Alabasu District of Otog Banner received instructions from the higher-level government regarding the investigation of livestock deaths. A comrade who knew a little Chinese studied it for a long time and mistakenly thought that it was necessary to investigate the "male and female" quantities of livestock, which caused a lot of trouble. No one in the First District Office of Hangjin Banner understood Chinese, so they specifically prepared a box to lock up all the Chinese documents they received. In this way, it was difficult to implement the instructions from above.
    I believe that the People's Government of Suiyuan Province should pay attention to this issue and quickly study solutions in order to do a better job.

    绥远省人民政府的公文应同时写成蒙文和汉文
    绥远省伊克昭盟自治区鄂托克等旗的许多区村干部是蒙族人民。这些干部大多不认识汉字。但上级政府所发的文件，百分之七十以上都是用的汉文。这些干部为了保密，又不敢轻易找外人看文件，这就给工作造成了很大的损失。鄂托克旗阿拉巴素区在一九五一年收到了上级政府发来的关于调查牲畜死亡情况的指示，一位稍稍懂得一些汉文的同志研究了很久，误认为是要调查牲畜的“公母”数量，结果惹了不少麻烦。杭锦旗一区区公所没有人懂汉文，就专门预备了一个箱子，把收到的汉文公文都锁起来。这样，上级的指示就很难贯彻了。
    我认为，绥远省人民政府应该重视这个问题，迅速研究解决办法，以便把工作做得更好。
