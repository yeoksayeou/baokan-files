Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest dispatch: The Executive Committee meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation opened in Bucharest on the 18th. The meeting adopted the following agenda: 1. Resolutions of the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council; 2. The tasks of women's organizations in various countries to defend women's equal rights; 3. Achievements of International Children's Day and the task of strengthening activities to protect children. At the meeting on the 18th, representatives from various countries listened to and discussed Mrs. Gordon's report on the first item on the agenda.

Mrs. Gordon's report described the participation of women around the world in the struggle for peace in recent months, and explained that the prestige of the Women's International Democratic Federation is constantly increasing. The Executive Committee has received applications from many women's groups in Chile, Iraq, Transjordan, and Indonesia to join the Women's International Democratic Federation. Mrs. Gordon said: In view of the World Peace Council's decision to convene the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5 this year, we have decided to postpone the International Women's Congress to next summer so that we can make a full contribution to the Vienna Congress. Mrs. Gordon continued: We women unanimously believe that the current war in Korea is a criminal war. The US government refuses to admit to conducting bacteriological warfare, but the facts are true and undeniable. Women are actively participating in the struggle against bacteriological warfare. Women also deeply understand that ratifying the Bonn Treaty means the division of Germany. The German question is not only related to the mothers of Germany, but is also a matter of great concern to the women of all of Germany's neighboring countries. The people of Europe and Asia are increasingly clearly aware of the ominous role of the US government in the international arena, and the American people are also awakening day by day. This can be proved by the one million signatures on the petition demanding the immediate exchange of all prisoners of war in Korea. Mrs. Gordon finally pointed out: We deeply know that without broad unity, it is impossible to defend the rights of children and women, and democracy and peace. We must unite women who agree with the goals and tasks of our Women's International Democratic Federation, and also unite millions of other women, and even women in other organizations who only agree with one item in our program. After discussing this report, the current Executive Committee meeting will formulate tasks, draft and distribute an appeal to women around the world, calling on women around the world to participate in our struggle. Our task is arduous, but we can carry out our task, and peace will surely prevail.

When discussing Mrs. Gordon's report at the evening meeting on the 18th, German representative Weber pointed out: The German Democratic Women's Federation has launched a widespread movement demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany based on the Soviet proposal. The German Democratic Women's Federation is fighting together with other democratic groups and will never allow West German weapons to be aimed at our own compatriots and other peace-loving people. Australian representative McLay said: Australian women are redoubling their efforts to prevent the government from ratifying the so-called Japanese Peace Treaty; women are launching a vigorous peace movement, demanding the withdrawal of Australian soldiers from Korea. The Indian representative said: Although Indian women have many differences in political views, we have established a unified women's leadership committee to guide the common struggle related to women's lives and interests. The American aggressors' frantic attacks on Korea have awakened women all over India. The American army's massacre of Korean women and children has aroused the indignation of all people with a sense of justice in India. Soviet representative Popova said: Fighting for the solution of the German and Japanese questions in accordance with the demands of hundreds of millions of people in various countries is the goal of our Women's International Democratic Federation and its affiliated women's groups in various countries. Women of all countries are deeply satisfied with the World Peace Council's declaration convening the World People's Peace Congress. Representatives from Bulgaria and Chile also spoke at the meeting on the 18th.

    国际民主妇联执委会会议开幕
    戈登夫人报告妇女参加和平斗争的情况
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会会议十八日在布加勒斯特开幕。会议通过了下列议程：一、世界和平理事会特别会议的各项决议；二、各国妇女组织保卫妇女平等权利的任务；三、国际儿童节的成绩和加强保卫儿童活动的任务。在十八日的会议上各国代表听取并讨论了戈登夫人就议程第一项所作的报告。
    戈登夫人的报告叙述了最近几个月来全世界妇女参加和平斗争的情况，并说明国际民主妇联的威信不断增加，执行委员会已经接到了智利、伊拉克、外约旦和印度尼西亚等国的许多妇女团体要求参加国际民主妇联的申请书。戈登夫人说：鉴于世界和平理事会已决定今年十二月五日在维也纳召开世界人民和平大会，我们决定把国际妇女大会延期到明年夏天举行，使我们能在维也纳大会上作出充分的贡献。戈登夫人接着说：我们妇女一致认为目前在朝鲜进行的战争是罪恶的战争。美国政府不肯承认进行细菌战，但是事实却是千真万确，妇女们正积极参加反对细菌战的斗争。妇女们并深深地了解到：批准波恩条约就意味着德国的分裂。德国的问题不仅与德国的母亲们有关，也是德国的一切邻国的妇女们所非常关心的问题。欧洲和亚洲的人民正在日益清楚地认识到美国政府在国际上的不祥作用，美国人民也一天天地觉醒了，这一点可以在要求在朝鲜立刻交换全部俘虏的请愿书上的一百万个签名来证明。戈登夫人最后指出：我们深知没有广泛的团结是不可能保卫儿童、妇女的权利和民主与和平的。我们必须团结同意我们国际民主妇联的目标和任务的妇女们，同时也应团结千千万万的其他妇女，甚至也应团结其他组织中只同意我们纲领中的一个项目的妇女们。目前的执行委员会会议在讨论这个报告之后将拟订任务，草拟并分发一项致全世界妇女的呼吁书，要求全世界妇女参加我们的斗争。我们的任务是艰巨的，但是我们能够贯彻我们的任务，和平必定胜利。
    在十八日晚间会议上讨论戈登夫人的报告时，德国代表韦伯发言指出：德国民主妇联已发起一个广泛的运动，要求以苏联的建议为基础缔结对德和约。德国民主妇联正在和其他民主团体一起斗争，决不容许西德的武器对准我们自己的同胞和其他爱好和平的人民。澳大利亚代表麦克莱说：澳大利亚妇女正在加倍努力，不许政府批准所谓对日和约；妇女正在展开如火如荼的和平运动，要求撤回朝鲜的澳大利亚士兵。印度代表说：尽管印度妇女在政治见解方面有许多分歧，但我们已建立了一个统一的妇女领导委员会，来指导和妇女生命和利益有关的共同斗争。美国侵略者对朝鲜的疯狂进攻已使全印度的妇女觉醒了，美国军队残杀朝鲜妇孺已引起印度所有有正义感的人的愤慨。苏联代表波波娃说：按照各国亿万人民的要求为解决德国和日本问题而斗争，是我们国际民主妇联和所属各国妇女团体的目标。一切国家的妇女对世界和平理事会召开世界人民和平大会的宣言深为满意。在十八日会议上发言的还有保加利亚和智利的代表。
