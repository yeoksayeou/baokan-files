    Correct the Attitude of Neglecting the Promotion of Advanced Experience

    The several articles published in today's newspaper regarding the promotion of advanced production experience reflect two different attitudes of some factory and mine leading cadres toward advanced experience, and the resulting two different outcomes in the increased production and economy movement.

    One is the correct attitude, such as that adopted by the Party and government leading cadres of the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory. They valued the promotion of advanced experience, valued the work of cultivating advanced workers, and helped and encouraged advanced worker Meng Tianlu in various ways, enabling him to successfully invent a set of steel wire machine work methods and create a new record for the Northwest region's textile factories in reducing returned cotton waste.

    The other attitude is completely opposite to this. For example, the leading cadres of the state-owned Shanghai Sixteenth Cotton Textile Factory did not value the wisdom of the workers and the experience of advanced producers; they allowed activists who promoted advanced experience to be attacked in the factory. As a result, advanced work methods could not be promoted in the factory, and they did not cultivate the advanced production team, causing it to lose its role as a production banner. Furthermore, some leading cadres in the Northeast coal mine system, although verbally emphasizing the importance of advanced experience, did not pay attention to specific leadership work, causing the work of promoting advanced experience to become a mere formality and unable to form a mass movement. Due to their adoption of this attitude, the increased production and economy movement was hindered, and the country's production suffered losses.

    Currently, the increased production and economy movement has been universally launched throughout the country. Although the progress of work in various regions varies, for example, some are formulating plans, while others are victoriously completing plans; the specific requirements for increased production and economy in each enterprise are also different, with some mainly increasing production, some mainly improving quality, and others mainly saving raw materials. However, there is a common principle that must be followed, which is to mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses and vigorously promote advanced experience. Only by doing this work well can the realization of the increased production and economy plan be guaranteed. Therefore, the leading cadres of each factory and mine must earnestly correct the attitude of not valuing the promotion of advanced experience, and the relevant leading organs should strengthen regular inspection work so that advanced experience can be promoted in a timely manner and the increased production and economy movement can be carried out more smoothly.

### 纠正忽视推广先进经验的态度

    纠正忽视推广先进经验的态度
    今天本报发表的几篇有关推广先进生产经验的稿件，反映了某些厂矿领导干部对待先进经验的两种不同态度，及由此产生的在增产节约运动中的两种不同的结果。
    一种是正确的态度，例如国营西北第四棉纺织厂的党、政领导干部所采取的态度。他们重视推广先进经验，重视培养先进工人的工作，从各方面帮助与鼓励先进工人孟天禄，使他顺利地发明了一套钢丝机工作法，并创造了西北区纺织厂少出回花的新纪录。
    另外一种态度，则与此完全相反。例如国营上海第十六棉纺织厂的领导干部，他们不重视工人的智慧与先进生产者的经验；他们听任推广先进经验的积极分子在厂里遭受打击，结果，先进的工作法在该厂无法推广，他们对先进的生产小组也没有加以培养，使它失去了生产上的旗帜作用。又如东北煤矿系统中的某些领导干部，虽然口喊先进经验的重要，却不注意去作具体的领导工作，就使推广先进经验的工作流于形式，不能形成群众性运动。由于他们采取这种态度，就妨碍了增产节约运动，使国家生产受到损失。
    目前，全国已普遍展开了增产节约运动，各地工作的进度虽有不同，例如有的正在制订计划，有的正胜利地完成着计划；各企业增产节约的具体要求也不一样，有的主要是增加生产，有的主要是提高质量，有的是节约原材料。但是有一个共同的原则必须遵行，这就是发动群众的创造性和积极性，大力推广先进经验。只有作好这一工作，才能保证增产节约计划的实现。因此，各厂矿领导干部必须切实纠正不重视推广先进经验的态度，各有关领导机关，应该加强经常的检查工作，使先进经验能够及时推广，更加顺利地展开增产节约运动。
