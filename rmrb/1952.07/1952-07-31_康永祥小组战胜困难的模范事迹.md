    The Model Deeds of Kang Yongxiang's Team in Overcoming Difficulties
    Editor: The Kang Yongxiang team, a model team for safe production in the Fujiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, was recently transferred by the leadership to work in the Nanguan pit, which was experiencing production difficulties. After arriving at the Nanguan pit, Kang Yongxiang led his fellow workers to actively investigate the coal properties, roof conditions, and safety situation. They found that repairing the main roadway was the key to developing the Nanguan pit, but repairing this roadway presented many difficulties. Because the main roadway had been flooded and had not been mined for more than a year, the roadway had collapsed, stone slag had accumulated, and there was a lot of water (about eight tons per hour). Kang Yongxiang tried every means in his work to boost the morale of the workers and lead everyone to overcome difficulties, working in the roadway with water three feet deep. After a month of hard work, the Kang Yongxiang team successfully completed the renovation of the main roadway, excavating and repairing forty meters of roadway, clearing more than 130 cubic meters of stone slag, salvaging more than 100 tons of coal from the water, and erecting more than fifty sets of supports.

    康永祥小组战胜困难的模范事迹
    编辑同志：劳动模范康永祥小组，是山西省富家滩煤矿安全生产的模范小组，最近领导方面把他们调到生产有困难的南关坑去工作。到了南关坑后，康永祥就带着工友们积极地调查煤性、顶板和安全情况。他们发现整修正道是发展南关坑的关键，但整修这条巷道是有很多困难的。因为正巷遭受水患，已经一年多没有开采了，巷道陷落、石渣堆积，并且出水很多（每小时约出八吨水）。康永祥在工作中想尽办法鼓舞工友们的情绪，带动大家克服困难，在水深三尺的巷道内工作，经过一个月的坚苦奋斗，康永祥小组胜利完成了大巷的整修工程，共掘进和整修巷道四十公尺，清出了石渣一百三十多立方公尺，从水里捞出煤一百多吨，架棚子五十多架。
