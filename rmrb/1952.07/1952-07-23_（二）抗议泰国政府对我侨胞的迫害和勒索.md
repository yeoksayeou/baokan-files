    (II) Protest Against the Thai Government's Persecution and Extortion of Our Overseas Chinese
    The Thai government reiterated on June 20th its unreasonable measure to increase the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" twentyfold, from 20 Baht to 400 Baht per person per year. This is clearly an act of persecution and extortion against our vast number of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and a reactionary measure that the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate.
    In recent years, the Thai Phibunsongkhram government, following the US aggressors' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, has imposed an embargo on our country, leading to a decline in the prices of tin, rice, and rubber in Thailand, a downturn in all industries, and a decreasing income. The Thai government's inappropriate increase of the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" to a level beyond the ability of our overseas Chinese to bear is intended, on the one hand, to extort a large sum of money from our overseas Chinese to supplement its insufficient war preparation expenses. According to a report in the Siamese "Quanmin Bao" in February of this year, a senior official of the Thai Police Department told reporters that the total revenue from this increase in "fees" "could reach 480 million Baht, and if the number of aliens obtaining identity certificates increases, this revenue will inevitably increase accordingly." What an unreasonable plundering! On the other hand, the Thai government attempts to force our overseas Chinese who are unable to pay the "fee" to become coolies, and even to force them to serve as soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in Taiwan, to collect cannon fodder for the US imperialist policy of expanding the war with Thailand as a base. We must pay serious attention to this shameful conspiracy of the Thai government!
    The Thai government's unreasonable increase in the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" will plunge the vast majority of our overseas Chinese in Thailand into dire straits. There are more than 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand, accounting for more than 90 percent of the foreign population in Thailand. The vast majority of them are shop assistants, workers, small vendors, and farmers, living in extreme poverty; an ordinary wage earner now has only 300 to 400 Baht of income per month, which is not enough to maintain the minimum living expenses of a family of five. When the Thai government increased the so-called "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" from 4 Baht to 20 Baht in 1950, many of our overseas Chinese were already struggling to afford it; now, with a sudden increase of twentyfold, taking a family of five as an example, the whole family would have to pay as much as 2,000 Baht a year, which will inevitably plunge the vast majority of our overseas Chinese into a miserable situation of being unable to live and being displaced.
    Since the Thai "Supreme Administrative Council" passed this "law" on February 4th of this year, it has been universally opposed by the vast number of our overseas Chinese in Thailand. In many cities and villages, our overseas Chinese have launched large-scale petitioning and reasoning movements, resolutely demanding that the Thai government reduce this burden that is beyond their means. This action taken by our overseas Chinese for their own right to survival is completely reasonable and legitimate, and has not only won widespread sympathy from people of all walks of life in Thailand, but also received deep concern and firm support from the people of the motherland. As early as March 11th of this year, He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of our country, issued a statement on this matter, denouncing the Thai government's barbaric measures of increasing the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" and persecuting our overseas Chinese. Now, we once again solemnly warn the Thai government: this outrageous and unreasonable behavior of yours, which seriously infringes upon the right to survival of millions of our overseas Chinese in Thailand, is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people; you must stop this brutal persecution and extortion! You must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this persecution of our overseas Chinese!

### （二）抗议泰国政府对我侨胞的迫害和勒索

    （二）抗议泰国政府对我侨胞的迫害和勒索
    泰国政府于六月二十日重申把“外侨随身证例费”提高二十倍，即从每人每年缴纳泰币二十铢增加到四百铢的无理措施。这显然是对我在泰国的广大侨胞的迫害和勒索行为，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的反动措施。
    近年以来，泰国銮披汶政府追随美国侵略者的扩军备战政策，对我国实行禁运，致泰国的锡、米、橡胶价格下落，百业不振，收入日益减少。泰国政府把“外侨随身证例费”不适当地提高到为我国侨胞负担能力所不及的高度，其目的一方面是要勒索我国侨胞的大批钱财，以补充其备战费用的不足。据今年二月暹罗“全民报”所载消息，泰国警察厅一个高级官员告该报记者说，这次提高的“例费”，“收入总额可达四万万八千万铢，如果领取随身证的外侨人数有所增加时，此项收入势必随之增加的”。这是一个多么无理的掠夺！另一方面，泰国政府企图通过这一无理措施，强迫无力缴纳“例费”的我国侨胞充当苦工，甚至强迫他们充当台湾蒋匪军队的士兵，替美帝国主义以泰国为基地来扩大战争的侵略政策搜集炮灰。我们必须严重注视泰国政府的这种可耻的阴谋！
    泰国政府无理增加“外侨随身证例费”的措施，将使在泰国的绝大多数我国侨胞的生活陷于窘境。我国在泰国的侨胞有三百五十多万人，占泰国外侨的百分之九十以上。他们绝大部分是店员、工人、小商贩和农民，生活十分困苦；一个普通的工薪劳动者，现在每月只有三、四百铢的收入，不足以维持五口之家的最低生活。当泰国政府一九五零年把所谓“外侨随身证例费”由四铢递增到二十铢时，我们的许多侨胞便已苦于无力负担；现在突然增加二十倍，仍以五口之家为例，全家一年便要缴纳二千铢之巨，这必将使我绝大部分侨胞陷于无法生活、颠沛流离的惨境。
    自泰国“最高行政会议”于今年二月四日通过这项“法令”以来，它便遭到在泰国的广大我国侨胞的普遍反对，在许多城市和乡村，我国侨胞展开了大规模的请愿说理运动，坚决要求泰国政府减轻这种为他们力所不及的负担。我国侨胞为了自身生存权利而采取的这种行动，是完全合理和合法的，不仅在当地得到泰国各阶层人民的广泛同情，更得到祖国人民深切的关怀与坚决的支持。早在今年三月十一日，我国华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员对这件事就发表了谈话，斥责泰国政府增加“外侨随身证例费”、迫害我国侨胞的横蛮措施。现在，我们再次正告泰国政府：你们这种严重侵犯在泰国的数百万我国侨胞生存权利的蛮横无理的行为，是我国人民所绝对难于容忍的；你们必须停止这种残暴的迫害和勒索行为！你们必须对这种迫害我国侨胞的行为的后果负严重的责任！
