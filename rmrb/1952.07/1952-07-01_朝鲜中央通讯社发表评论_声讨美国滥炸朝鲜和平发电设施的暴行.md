    The Korean Central News Agency Publishes Commentary
    Denouncing the U.S. Atrocity of Indiscriminately Bombing Peaceful Power Generation Facilities in Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 29th, sternly denouncing the U.S. aggressors' atrocities of indiscriminately bombing the peaceful power generation facilities of the Korean people. The commentary stated: As everyone knows, these power plants are closely linked to the daily lives of the Korean people and are valuable equipment indispensable to peaceful construction endeavors. The U.S. aggressors' actions of destroying these non-military and peaceful facilities used to improve the people's well-being once again expose their greedy aggressive ambitions to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations, expand the war of aggression against Korea, and turn the Korean people into their colonial slaves.
    The commentary pointed out: The aggressors' bestial acts of indiscriminately bombing power plants in northern Korea can only further strengthen the Korean people's anger and determination to annihilate the enemy, and can only make the hatred and condemnation of the people of the world even stronger. The Korean people's fighting spirit to support the front lines and consolidate the rear can absolutely not be shaken in the slightest by this. If the U.S. aggressors attempt to use the atrocity of bombing power plants to frighten the Korean people or to exert some influence on the Korean armistice negotiations, it is truly an extremely foolish thing.
    The commentary finally emphasized: The U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to force the Korean people to submit through the atrocity of destroying peaceful facilities will inevitably be completely bankrupt in the face of the angry people.

    朝鲜中央通讯社发表评论
    声讨美国滥炸朝鲜和平发电设施的暴行
    【新华社三十日讯】朝鲜中央通讯社二十九日发表评论，严正声讨美国侵略者滥炸朝鲜人民和平发电设施的暴行。评论说：大家知道，这些发电厂是和朝鲜人民的日常生活紧密相连的，是和平建设事业上不可缺少的贵重设备。美国侵略者破坏这些非军事的和用于增进人民生活福利的和平设施的行为，再一次暴露了它破坏朝鲜停战谈判、扩大侵朝战争以及变朝鲜人民为其殖民地奴隶的贪婪的侵略野心。
    评论指出：侵略者滥炸朝鲜北部的发电厂的兽行，只能进一步加强朝鲜人民的愤怒与歼敌决心，只能使全世界人民的憎恨与声讨更加强烈。朝鲜人民支援前线和巩固后方的斗志，绝对不可能因此而有丝毫动摇。美国侵略者如果企图以轰炸发电厂的暴行来使朝鲜人民恐惧，或给朝鲜停战谈判以某种影响的话，那实在是绝顶愚蠢的事。
    评论最后强调指出：美国侵略者企图以破坏和平设施的暴行来迫使朝鲜人民屈服的阴谋，必然要在愤怒的人民面前彻底破产。
