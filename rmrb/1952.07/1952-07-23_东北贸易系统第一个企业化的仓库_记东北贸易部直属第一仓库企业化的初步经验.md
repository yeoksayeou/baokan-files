    The First Enterprise-Oriented Warehouse in the Northeast Trading System
    ——A Preliminary Account of the Enterprise-Oriented Experience of the First Warehouse Directly Under the Northeast Trade Department
    Wang Ping

    The warehouse is an important link in the process of commodity circulation. The requirements for a warehouse in commodity circulation are: safe storage, no damage or loss, quick entry and exit, and accurate allocation. However, the common phenomena in current warehouses are: chaotic inventory, high loss rate, and slow entry and exit. This is a sharp contradiction. According to the experience of the First Warehouse directly under the Northeast Trade Department, the best way to solve this contradiction is to make the warehouse enterprise-oriented.

    A simple explanation of enterprise-oriented means that the warehouse's funds are independent, it is self-sufficient, and it strives for reasonable profits. The income of an enterprise-oriented warehouse is the storage fee charged to the depositing unit, which is one ten-thousandth of the total value of the goods stored; all expenses during the storage process are paid from this income. This requires economic accounting, improving work efficiency, saving funds, and reducing the commodity loss rate. Therefore, to implement enterprise-oriented on the basis of the existing warehouse is a serious struggle. It must first eliminate the chaotic inventory phenomenon.

    Before May, the chaotic inventory phenomenon in the First Warehouse directly under the Northeast Trade Department was very serious. This is a general merchandise warehouse. There are five warehouses and seven storage yards. One kind of commodity is scattered and piled in various warehouses and yards; hundreds and thousands of different kinds of goods are piled in one warehouse or yard. Commodities that absolutely should not be piled together, such as dyes and foreign yarn, soap and white sugar – because piling them together will cause the latter to deteriorate – were piled together; even poisonous hyposulfite (a chemical used in developing photographs) and crystal sugar were mixed together. This kind of "hundreds of items mixed together" almost made every warehouse keeper responsible for all the general merchandise. The warehouse keepers were dizzy from this chaotic phenomenon. In addition, the leadership at the time did not pay enough attention to the warehouse, so there was a "watching the pile" mentality and a "hired hand" point of view among the warehouse staff; irresponsibility became a trend, and the situation became even more serious.

    Here is an example:

    Once, a goods collector from the Shenyang District Department Store Wholesale Station went to Warehouse No. 7 of the First Warehouse to pick up cough syrup. The warehouse keeper looked at the "pile" and replied, "There is no cough syrup here, only ? cough syrup." The goods collector suspected that the delivery note was written incorrectly and requested a change; the warehouse manager agreed. They simply added a "口" radical next to the "止" radical in "止咳" (zhǐ ké - stop cough) to make it "?咳" (? ké), and took away a thousand boxes of "? cough syrup." The prices of these two kinds of "cough syrup" are very different: cough syrup is 2,900 yuan per box, while "? cough syrup" is 53,500 yuan per box; the people "watching the pile" irresponsibly issued a large batch of goods with only the name changed and not the price! This warehouse keeper of Warehouse No. 7 did not not know that there was a large batch of "cough syrup" in other warehouses, but he only cared about "watching the pile" and nothing else; as for sending the wrong goods, he thought: "Anyway, the manager agreed to 'change the note,' it has nothing to do with me!" This is in line with the fallacy of "speak less, earn more money" that was popular in the warehouse at that time. These people only cared about "watching the pile" and taking the money, and did not offer any opinions no matter how chaotic the warehouse became. Tian Xusan, the acting warehouse chief of Warehouse No. 7, was a representative of this erroneous thinking. He came from a merchant background and was so skilled in business that he could identify the specifications and quality of various knitwear at a glance, but he did not intend to contribute this skill to the country. Whenever work was tense, he would ask for leave to go home. Therefore, Warehouse No. 7, which he managed, was the most chaotic.

    Enterprise-oriented is out of the question if we don't eradicate this chaotic phenomenon and its roots. Cadres sent by the Northeast Trade Department to strengthen the work of the First Warehouse saw this clearly, and in accordance with the principle of combining political work and business, launched an ideological construction movement among all the warehouse staff. They started by criticizing Tian Xusan's thinking, combined with studying the Trade Department's instructions on improving warehouse management, and launched ideological and business inspections; in the movement, they established a political work system centered on the leadership of the Party, and established a scientific management system, so that the warehouse enterprise-oriented initially had a scale, significantly accelerating the circulation of goods. This is centrally reflected in "fast entry and fast exit." In the past, it took three to five days for goods to enter the warehouse, and sometimes it took ten and a half months to enter the warehouse. Now, except for goods with different bill and weight and very complex goods, most goods are guaranteed to enter the warehouse within 24 hours; in the past, it took eight procedures to take goods out of the warehouse (pick up goods), and it took half a day to wait for a small box of goods, now it is guaranteed to be picked up and issued as soon as you arrive, and there are few accidents such as "changing notes," "substituting notes," and sending the wrong goods.

    This is not only due to political work, improving the political consciousness of employees and correcting the employees' understanding of the function of the warehouse, but also in business, mainly because they have grasped the two important links of dedicated zones and responsibilities and quota management.

    The main content of dedicated zones and responsibilities is to classify and store goods in order to achieve order and logic. They divided the general merchandise into eighteen categories, and one warehouse or yard specializes in storing one or two categories of goods (only one warehouse stores three categories). Each category of goods is divided into several varieties according to specifications (such as cloth divided into white cloth, floral cloth...), and the warehouse or yard storing the goods is divided into several areas for storage. These practical tasks are reflected in charts: the manager's office has a "commodity zoning storage map," and the warehouse chief and warehouse keeper have a "goods storage plan" for their warehouse and area – it is clear at a glance what goods are stored where. Follow the map to find the goods, and when you find the goods stack, there is a card hanging on the stack, which shows the name of the goods, category, quantity, when the goods were put in the warehouse, when the goods were taken out of the warehouse... It is clear at a glance. Along with this dedicated zone and responsibilities, there have also been major reforms in personnel allocation and system procedures, mainly to allocate commodity accountants to the warehouses and yards to handle commodity accounting procedures (in the past, it was handled in the business section), which not only eliminated the chaotic phenomenon that the business section and the warehouses and yards each kept a book of accounts that often did not match, but also reduced the level of outgoing procedures. Now, the picker only needs to be guided directly to the warehouse and yard where the goods are to be picked up by the receiving and dispatching department according to the "commodity zoning storage map," and the procedures can be completed and the goods can be picked up immediately. The warehouse keeper has formulated a contact responsibility system, and actively and closely contacts the picker, resident, porters' union, station, and other warehouses and yards – this is the key to "fast entry and fast exit."

    Quota management can greatly improve storage efficiency. What they have already implemented and have seen results is the "storage quota per unit area"; what they are preparing to implement is the "commodity storage time quota." Before the "storage quota per unit area" was implemented, the entire warehouse only loaded four or five hundred trucks of goods, and they were still saying "there is not enough space." After the implementation of the storage quota, one square meter increased from only half a ton of gauze to 1.462 tons; each warehouse and yard increased from loading forty-five trainloads of goods to ninety trainloads. Now 95% of the goods are stored according to the new quota. The personal storage quota of the warehouse keeper has also increased by about one time – the average warehouse keeper stores ten trainloads of goods. The "commodity storage time quota" is being discussed and drafted with the inventory units, and it is planned to set the storage period separately according to "year-round sales products," "seasonal products," and "products restricted by natural conditions"...

    The implementation of quota management will inevitably encounter the obstruction of conservative thinking among warehouse keepers and the supply system thinking of various inventory units.

    The conservative elements among the warehouse keepers believe that the old standard of "one person's height" for the goods stack is immutable. A warehouse keeper named Zhao Dachang said: "If you can stack the goods stack one time higher, I can stack it two times higher for you!" He pointed out that the goods stack is too high, the porters are unwilling to do it; the yarn bundles will be damaged if they are thrown down from a height, and other difficulties. Some people seconded his opinion. The leadership, on the one hand, relied on political work to explain and persuade; on the other hand, mobilized advanced employees to conduct on-site experiments; and also went to discuss with the porters' union. The results proved that the porters' union is investing in the increase production and saving movement, and they fully support increasing the height of the goods stack according to the new quota; the experiment also proved that as long as the unloading method is slightly improved, the yarn bundles will not be damaged when they roll down from a height – the new quota was universally implemented.

    The remnants of the supply system thinking of the inventory units are mainly reflected in the time of picking up the goods. They believe that the length of time the goods are stored in the warehouse does not matter, anyway, not much is consumed, or even does not need to be consumed, and they can pick up the goods whenever they want. Therefore, many goods have been backlogged in the warehouse for a long time. The Shenyang District Department Store Wholesale Station stored 120 boxes of butter in the warehouse in January this year. It has been melting for a long time in the summer. The warehouse has repeatedly urged them to pick it up, but they still did not pick it up; later, Jiang Yu-fan, a very responsible warehouse chief, personally went to the store to investigate and reported the situation to the Trade Department. The wholesale station picked up the butter on July 8. This is not an isolated example. This is a great hindrance to commodity circulation, commodity quality, and warehouse enterprise-oriented. Only the "commodity storage time quota" can completely eliminate this phenomenon.

    On the basis of the initial implementation of dedicated zones and responsibilities and quota management, reducing the commodity loss rate and preserving the quality of commodities have become important issues and have been put on the agenda. This is an important responsibility of the warehouse and one of the contents of enterprise-oriented. They found that the two main reasons for the high commodity loss rate and the deterioration of the quality of the stored commodities are: poor technical storage and damage to the commodity packaging during transportation; they formulated specific methods to overcome these two root causes. They added several technical instructors to the business section to specialize in studying and guiding technical storage, and regularly inspect the stored commodities; recently, they are preparing to formulate a safe storage system for summer perishable commodities through the inspection of summer perishable commodities, and are also preparing to establish a "packaging team" to be responsible for inspecting and repackaging commodities with damaged packaging before they are put into the warehouse – implement a "one-time inventory system" for these commodities to be responsible to the end, in order to remove the picker's special concern for this kind of commodity (therefore, they often require repeated inventory) and reduce losses.

    When the warehouse is on the right track, business is developing day by day, the number of goods entering the warehouse is increasing day by day, and the materials used in the warehouse are becoming more and more massive, saving materials is an important content of the warehouse's saving funds. Therefore, the leadership called on all employees to find tricks to save materials. The largest item of warehouse materials is the sleepers used to cushion the bottom of the goods stacks and the tarpaulins used for waterproofing and moisture-proofing. Everyone used their brains on this. Between the end of June and the beginning of July, an initiative with great significance for saving materials in the warehouse appeared. This is to use cement blocks instead of sleepers to cushion the bottom, and improve the cushion method to "one star manages four" (that is, one cement block cushions the corners of four boxes – originally two sleepers cushioned one box). In the past, each trainload of goods required 5.76 million yuan of sleepers to cushion the bottom, and after changing to cement blocks, it only requires 575,000 yuan; according to the number of vehicles in the warehouse that use the new cushion method, it has saved the country more than 2.535 billion yuan. The value of one-third of the tarpaulins saved due to the implementation of the new cushion method is not included; and the average service life of sleepers is three years, and the minimum service life of cement blocks is fifty years – the savings in this area are even impossible to calculate.

    The warehouse has made certain achievements in enterprise-oriented, but there is still a lot of work that has not been fixed by articles and systems, and there is a lot of work that has just begun. For the inventory of goods, they have only understood the "approximate numbers," and a deeper understanding has not been achieved. For example, how much of the inventory of goods are fast-selling goods, how much are "cold goods," how should fast-selling goods be urged to pick up by the inventory units, so as not to lose the fast-selling opportunity, how should "cold goods" be notified to reduce purchases, so as to avoid forming a greater backlog. They plan to start with several important commodities, study and master its outgoing and incoming – production and sales laws, so as to gradually make the warehouse play a role like a "thermometer" – which goods are purchased too much, which goods are sold poorly, it can feel very sensitively, and promptly remind the inventory units to pay attention. At that time, the role of the warehouse in trade work will be brought into greater play. (Reprinted from Northeast Daily)

    东北贸易系统第一个企业化的仓库
    ——记东北贸易部直属第一仓库企业化的初步经验
    王坪
    仓库是商品流转过程中的一个重要环节。商品流转对仓库的要求是：保管妥善、不损不丢、快进快出、调拨准确。但当前仓库的普遍现象则是：库存混乱、损耗率高、进出缓慢。这是一个尖锐的矛盾。根据东北贸易部直属第一仓库的经验，解决这一矛盾的最好方法是使仓库企业化。
    企业化的简单解释是：仓库资金独立，实行自给自足，并争取合理的利润。企业化仓库的收入是向存货单位抽取托存商品总值的万分之一的保管费；保管过程中的一切费用，都从这一收入中支出。这就非实行经济核算，并提高工作效率、节省资金、减低商品损耗率不可。因此，要在仓库现存的基础上实行企业化，是一场严重的斗争。它首先必须铲除库存混乱现象。
    在五月份以前，东北贸易部直属第一仓库的库存混乱现象是十分严重的。这是一个百货仓库。库里有五个库房，七个货场。一种商品分散堆积在各个库、场里；一个库、场里堆积着成百上千各种各样的货物。染料和洋纱，香皂和白糖等绝不能堆在一起——堆在一起就会使后者变质——的商品，竟堆在一起了；甚至还把有毒的海波（洗照片用的药）和冰糖混杂着放在一起。这样“百品混陈”，几乎使每一个保管员都保管着所有的百货商品。保管员们被这种混乱现象弄得头晕脑胀。加上当时领导上对仓库重视不够，使仓库人员中存在着“看堆”思想和“雇佣观点”；不负责任成为一种风气，情况就更加严重了。
    这里有一个例子：
    有一次，沈阳地区百货批发站提货员往第一仓库七号库房提取止咳糖。保管员看了看“堆”，回答说：“这里没有止咳糖，只有?咳糖。”提货员怀疑是提货票写错了，请求改票；仓库经理同意了。他们就仅仅在“止”字旁边加一“口”字，便把一千盒“?咳糖”提走了。而这两种“止咳糖”的价格却相差很大：止咳糖二千九百元一盒，“?咳糖”则是五万三千五百元一盒；“看堆”的人们居然把只改品名未改价格的大批货物毫不负责任地发出去了！这七号库房的保管员并不是不知道别的库房有大批的“止咳糖”，但他只管“看堆”，不管其它；至于发错了货，他想：“反正是经理同意‘改票’的，与我无干！”这是合乎当时在仓库里流行的那种“少说话、多拿钱”的谬论的。这些人只管“看堆”、拿钱，不管仓库混乱到什么程度都不提意见。七号库房的代理库长田序三是这种错误思想的代表人物。他是商人出身，业务熟练到只稍看一眼就能辨识出各种针织品的规格、质量，但他并没有打算把这种本领贡献给国家，每当工作紧张，他反而告假回家。所以他所管理的七号库最混乱。
    不把这种混乱现象及其根源铲除，是谈不上企业化的。东北贸易部派去加强第一仓库工作的干部看清了这一点，便根据政治工作和业务相结合的原则，在仓库全体人员中展开了思想建设运动。他们从批判田序三思想着手，结合着学习贸易部关于改善仓库管理工作的指示，展开了思想检查和业务检查；在运动中建立了以党的领导为中心的政治工作制度，并整理和建立起科学经营管理制度，使仓库企业化初步具备了规模，显著地加速了商品流转。其集中反映为“快进快出”。在过去，商品入库需时三天五天，有时十天半月还不能入库，现在除了货票不同斤的货物和十分繁复的商品外，绝大部分货物保证在二十四小时内入库；过去商品出库（提货）要办八道手续，领一小箱商品要等候大半天，现在保证随到随出，而且很少发生“改票”、“顶票”、发错货物等事故。
    这除了是得力于政治工作，提高职工政治觉悟与端正了职工对仓库职能的认识外，在业务上，主要是因为他们抓住了专区专责和定额保管这两个重要环节。
    专区专责的主要内容是把商品分类保管，以达到有条有理。他们把百货分成十八类，一个库、场专门保管一类或两类商品（只有一个库保管三类）。又把每类商品按照规格分成若干品种（如布匹类下分白布、花布……），在保管该类货品的库、场内再划分若干区域，分别储存。把这些实际工作反映在图表上：经理室有一份“商品分区保管图”，库长和保管员有一份本库、本区的“货物存放平面图”——什么商品储存什么地方一目了然。按图找货，找到货垛时，货垛上挂着卡片，卡片上载明该货垛的品名、类量、何时入库数目、何时出库数目……了如指掌。随着这专区专责而来的，人事配备和制度手续也有重大改革，这主要是把商品会计配备到库、场里办理商品会计手续（过去是在业务科办理），这样既消灭了业务科和库、场各记一本账常不相符合的混乱现象，又减少了出库手续的层次。现在提货人只消由收发按“商品分区保管图”直接引导到出货的库、场，立刻就可以办理手续出库。保管员订出了联系责任制，主动和提货员、驻在员、搬运工会、车站及其他各库、场等各方面密切联系——这是“快进快出”的关键。
    定额保管可以大大提高保管效率。现在他们已经推行并已见成效的是“单位面积保管定额”；正准备推行的是“商品存库时间定额”。在没有实行“单位面积保管定额”前，全仓库只装四五百车货，还在叫“地方不够用”，推行保管定额后，一平方米从只放半吨纱布提高到可放一点四六二吨；每个库、场从装四十五火车货提高到可装九十火车。现在已有百分之九十五的商品按照新的定额实行保管了。保管员的个人保管定额，也随着提高一倍左右——一般保管员保管着十火车货。“商品存库时间定额”正在和各存货单位商量拟订中，准备根据
    “长年经销品”、“季节性商品”和“受自然条件限制商品”……等分别定出存库期限。
    推行定额保管必然会碰上仓库保管员中的保守思想和各存货单位的供给制思想的阻挠。
    保管员中的保守分子认为“一人一手高”这个货垛的老标准是不可改变的。一个叫赵大昌的保管员说：“你们要能把货垛堆高一倍，我可以堆高两倍给你们看看！”他提出：货垛太高，搬运工人不愿干；纱捆从高处往下扔也会摔坏等等困难。有一部分人附议他的意见。领导上一面依靠政治工作去进行解释，说服；一面动员先进职工实地试验；并去和搬运工会商量。结果证明：搬运工会正在投入增产节约运动，他们满心拥护按照新定额把货垛加高；实验又证明，只要稍稍地把卸货方法改良一下，纱捆从高处滚下地并不会受损——新定额才普遍推行了。
    存货单位的供给制思想残余主要表现在提货的时间上。他们认为商品存库时间长短没大关系，反正化销不多，甚至不用化销，爱什么时候提就什么时候提。因此有很多商品在仓库积压很久。沈阳地区百货批发站今年一月存库一百二十箱牛奶油，入夏很久已经开始溶化，经仓库多次催提仍不提取；后来由一位很负责任的库长姜玉藩亲往商店调查，并把这情况向贸易部汇报，该批发站才于七月八日把牛奶油提走。这不是个别例子。这对于商品流转、商品质量及仓库企业化的妨碍都是很大的。只有用“商品存库时间定额”才可以把这种现象彻底消灭。
    在专区专责和定额保管初步实行的基础上，减低商品损耗率和保存商品质量便成为重要的课题而提上日程。这是仓库的重要职责，也是企业化的内容之一。他们研究出造成商品损耗率高和库存商品质量变劣的两个主要原因是：技术保管不良和商品包装在运转途中破损；便针对这两个病根定出具体克服的办法。他们在业务科增设几个技术指导员，专门研究和指导技术保管，并经常检查库存商品；最近正通过夏季易腐商品的检查，准备制订出夏季易腐商品的安全保管制度，还准备成立“包装组”，负责检查和重新包装入库前包装破损的商品——在这种商品中实行“一次清点制”负责到底，以去除提货人对这种商品所特有的关心（因此他们时常要求重复清点）而减少损耗。
    在仓库走上轨道、业务日渐发展、入库商品日渐增多、库用资材日益巨大的情况下，节省资材是仓库节约资金的重要内容。因此领导上号召全体职工找窍门以节约资材。库用资材的最大宗是垫货垛底用的枕木和防水防潮的苫布。大家便在这上面用脑筋。六月底七月初之间，一件对仓库节省资材有着巨大意义的创举出现了。这就是用洋灰方代替枕木垫底，并把垫底的方式改良为“一星管四”（即一块洋灰方垫四只箱子的角——本来是两根枕木垫一只箱子）。过去每火车货要用五百七十六万元的枕木垫底，改为洋灰块后只需五十七万五千元；根据该仓库适用新式垫底法的车数计算，又为国家节省二十五亿三千五百万余元。因实行新式垫底法而节省了三分之一的苫布的价值还不算在内；而枕木的使用年限平均为三年，洋灰块最低的使用年限为五十年——这一方面的节约数字更是无从计算的。
    该仓库在企业化方面已有一定成绩，但还有很多工作没有用条文、制度固定下来，有很多工作才着手做，对于库存商品，也只是做到瞭解了“大约数字”，更深一层的瞭解还没有做到。例如库存商品中有多少是畅销品、多少是“冷货”，畅销品应如何催促存货单位提取，以免失去畅销时机，“冷货”应如何通知少采购，以免形成更大积压。他们准备从几类重要商品着手，研究和掌握住它的出库入库——生产推销的规律，以便逐渐使仓库起着一种“温度表”似的作用——什么货采购过多、什么货推销不力，它能很灵敏地感觉出来，而及时地提请存货单位注意。那时，仓库在贸易工作中的作用就更大地发挥出来了。（转载东北日报）
