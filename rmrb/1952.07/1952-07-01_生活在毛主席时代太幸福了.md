    It's So Wonderful to Live in the Era of Chairman Mao
    Pan Changyou, Model Worker of Tianjin Steel Plant

    Editor's Note: Our newspaper has received many articles from model workers celebrating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. We are now publishing four articles by Pan Changyou, Liu Lifu, Chen Shushun, and Song Baoliang.

    Pan Changyou is the first worker in our country to adopt the Soviet advanced experience of "hot repair" of open-hearth furnaces. During furnace repairs, he soaked his entire body with water and took the lead in entering the furnace to rebuild the insulation wall, saving five-sixths of the repair time compared to "cold repair." In 1950, he attended the National Congress of Labor, Peasant, and Soldier Model Workers.

    The 31st anniversary of the Party has arrived. I feel truly blessed to live in the new China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    In January 1950, the factory rewarded me with a leather "jacket." I felt it was special and didn't want to wear it. However, last winter, after the factory adjusted wages, more people were wearing leather "jackets." A few days ago, I was talking with representatives of workers' families, and the female representative from Cotton Mill No. 1 said: "The East Dormitory (entirely workers' housing) has seven or eight hundred worker families, and almost all of them are eating white flour. There are fewer than fifty families eating a mix of white flour and cornmeal." Before liberation, we couldn't even eat our fill of cornmeal. Now, every time we get paid, workers no longer calculate what to buy to eat. Some people are thinking about what brand of pen or watch to buy, and some are researching what color and pattern of material to use for shirts and trousers. Before liberation, workers went to work with their work permits in one hand and a bread roll in their armpits. Now, workers carry satchels on their shoulders, with books, newspapers, diaries, and documents inside. Workers go to work like students going to school.

    In the past, workers frowned and sighed. Now, workers' lives have improved, and their jobs are secure. This spring, the People's Government built a large number of dormitories for workers. Happy couples moved into the new dormitories with joy. Unmarried couples are also registering their wedding rooms in the new village. Today, in the workers' area, there is either singing or laughter; no more sighs, no more frowning faces.

    Every worker has personally experienced how today's happiness and joy have been achieved. Every worker's home has a picture of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall. When we go to work and get off work, seeing Chairman Mao's picture is like seeing our own relatives, and our enthusiasm for production comes. Comrade Yi, an open-hearth furnace operator, whose child was very ill, still went to work as usual and didn't want to tell his comrades. Those days were the furnace's medium repair period. Before liberation, workers would take the opportunity of medium repair to rest. But today, everyone has turned it into a "battle." Comrade Yi refused to leave the furnace for a single step. One day, his child was seriously ill, and his family came to find him, but he was still unwilling to leave his post until the cadres and workers pushed him back home. Another time, a piece of the vault of the lower regenerative chamber of the open-hearth furnace collapsed. According to the usual method, the furnace had to be dismantled and rebuilt. Doing so would affect the completion of the annual production task. The leadership was worried, but the bricklayers Liu Baoliang, Li Yongkai, and others had already automatically gone up to rescue it.

    The years of regarding workers as "uncouth" are also over. Even before the creation of the quick literacy method, our workers' cultural level was already very different from that before liberation. Take the workers in our open-hearth furnace, for example: furnace chiefs Liu Xiaohei and Chen Lao were both workers who used to be ordered around before liberation. After liberation, they went to spare-time schools and are now furnace chiefs, able to fill out steelmaking operation sheets themselves. This work used to be done by university-graduate technicians before liberation. The furnace operators are also promoted from ordinary workers and can fully master steelmaking technology. Experts are about to emerge from our workers. Chen Zuoxiang, Liu Baohe, and Chen Dequan have gone to the Department of Metallurgy at Renmin University to study. After graduation, they will become steelmaking engineers. Liu Xianting was also an ordinary worker. After liberation, he was promoted to director of the steelmaking department and is now studying in the Factory Management Department of Renmin University. I was originally an ordinary worker suffering from hunger and cold. Although I attended a private school for four years when I was a child, I had forgotten the few characters I knew. After liberation, I went to spare-time school. Under the education of the Party, I can now understand newspapers and documents. Because I have made some achievements in production, I was selected as a labor model and attended the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the factory, I was promoted to deputy director of the steelmaking department. I was also appointed by the Central People's Government as a member of the North China Administrative Committee, and the Tianjin Workers' Representative Conference elected me as the second vice chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Think about it, how can we workers not be happy in this situation?

    The happiness in my heart is indescribable. I can only say these little things. But from here, we can see how our workers have grown step by step under the leadership of the Party, and we can also see how much confidence we have in the future and how much we love the Party and our leader.

    生活在毛主席时代太幸福了
    天津钢厂劳动模范  潘长有
    编者按：本报收到许多劳动模范庆祝中国共产党成立三十一周年的文章，现在发表潘长有、刘立富、陈书舜、宋宝亮的四篇文章。
    潘长有是我国第一个接受苏联的先进经验“热修”马丁炉的工人。在修炉时，他用水浇湿全身衣服，带头钻进炉内，重垒隔热墙，使修炉时间比“冷修”节省六分之五。一九五○年，他曾出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。
    党的三十一周年纪念日来到了。我感到生活在共产党和毛主席领导的新中国，真是太幸福了。
    一九五零年一月，厂里奖给我一件皮“夹克”，我觉得很特殊，不愿穿。可是，去年冬天，厂里调整工资以后，穿皮“夹克”的人就多了。几天以前，我跟工人家属代表谈话，棉纺一厂的女代表说：“东宿舍（完全是工人住宅）七八百户工属，几乎都吃白面了，吃白面掺玉米面的，连五十户也不到。”在解放以前，我们吃玉米面都不能吃饱。现在每次发薪的时候，工人不再盘算买吃的了。有的人琢磨买什么牌的钢笔、手表，有的人研究买什么色什么花的料子做衬衣，做裤子。解放以前，工人上班时，一手拿着上工的本子，胳肢窝里夹着饽饽包。如今，工人肩膀上挂的是书包，书包里有书，有报，还有日记本和文件，工人上工，好像学生去上学。
    在过去，工人愁眉苦脸，唉声叹气。现在，工人生活提高了，工作有保障了。今年春天，人民政府给工人盖了大批的宿舍。一对一对的幸福的夫妇，欢天喜地地搬进新宿舍。未婚的夫妇也在新村登记上自己的洞房。今天在工人区域不是歌声，就是谈笑声，再也听不见叹息声，再也看不见愁眉苦脸了。
    今天的幸福和快乐，每一个工人都亲身体验出是怎么得来的。每个工人的家里都挂着毛主席的像片。我们上班和下班，看到毛主席像，就好像看到自己的亲人，生产劲头就来了。马丁炉司炉?义同志的孩子病得很厉害，还照常上班，不肯向同志们说。那几天正是中修炉子。要是在解放以前，工人便趁中修的机会歇一歇。可是今天大家把它变成了“战斗”的日子。?义同志不肯离开炉子一步。有一天，孩子病重，他家里的人来找他，可是他还不愿离开工作岗位，直到被干部和工人们把他推了回去。又有一回，马丁炉的下部蓄热室的镟顶塌了一块，按通常办法，必须拆炉子重修。这样做，就要影响全年生产任务的完成。领导方面正在着急，而瓦工刘宝良、李永凯等，已经自动上去抢救了。
    把工人看成“老粗”的年头儿也过去了。在速成识字法没有创造出来以前，我们工人的文化水平已经和解放前大大不一样了。拿我们马丁炉的工人来说吧：护炉长刘小黑和陈老对，在解放以前都是听人喝叫的工人。解放以后，他们上了业余学校，现在当了护炉长，已经能够亲自填写炼钢操作表。这项工作在解放以前是要大学毕业的技术员来担任的。司炉也都是普通工人提升的，能全部掌握炼钢技术。专家也快从我们工人里边出现啦。陈作祥、刘宝和、陈得全到人民大学冶金系学习去了，毕业以后就要成为炼钢工程师。刘宪庭原来也是普通工人，解放以后被提升为炼钢部主任，现在在人民大学工厂管理系学习。我本来也是个饥寒交迫的普通工人，小时候虽然上过四年私塾，但认识的几个字也都忘光了。解放以后我上业余学校，在党的教育下，现在已经看懂报纸和文件了。因为我在生产上有些成绩，被选为劳动模范，并列席人民政协全国委员会第二次会议。在厂里，我被提升为炼钢部副主任。我又被中央人民政府委任为华北行政委员会委员，天津市工人代表会又选我为市总工会第二副主席。想想看，这种情况，怎叫我们工人不高兴呢？
    我心里的高兴，是没法形容的。我只能说这些小事。但从这里，可以看出我们工人在党的领导下，是怎样一步一步地成长起来的，也可以看出我们对未来充满着多么大的信心，对党对领袖是多么的热爱。
