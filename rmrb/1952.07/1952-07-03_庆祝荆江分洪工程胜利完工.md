    Celebrating the Victorious Completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
    Tang Tianji, Commander-in-Chief of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project

    Dear National Working People, Valiant Chinese People's Volunteers, All Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    On this 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to our Party and Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, with immense excitement and joy, celebrating the greatness, correctness, and glory of our Party. I also report to you a major joyous event in the construction of our motherland: the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been victoriously completed.
    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project commenced comprehensively on April 5th of this year and was fully completed by June 20th. The main content of this project is to reinforce and strengthen the 133-kilometer-long Jingjiang levee on the east bank of the Jingjiang River in the north and south sections of Shashi, Hubei, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; to construct a large reservoir in the area of over 920 square kilometers on the west bank of the Jingjiang River, east of the Hudu River, and northwest of the Anxiang River at Ouchi Estuary, capable of holding 6 billion cubic meters of floodwater; to build a 54-hole floodgate, 1,054 meters long, at Taipingkou, Jiangling County, on the north side of the reservoir; and to build a 32-hole control gate, 336 meters long, at Huangshantou, Shishou County, on the south side of the reservoir, to control the Jingjiang floods that endanger the people. This vast project required the completion of approximately 10 million cubic meters of earthwork, concrete work, and stonework, tens of thousands of tons of steel reinforcement, and the transportation of over 100 million ton-kilometers of materials, tools, grain, and fodder. In addition, there were many auxiliary projects, such as the construction of over 130 kilometers of light railways, over 90 kilometers of highways, and so on. This project was carried out under the great call and wise decision of Chairman Mao, in accordance with the plan approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Central-South Military and Political Committee. We shortened the three-month project plan by 15 days and completed this great and arduous task in two and a half months. The completion of this project has spared the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River from disaster, ensured the safety of their lives and property, and guaranteed the bumper harvest of millions of mu of fertile land. It is also extremely beneficial to Yangtze River navigation and national transportation. Therefore, the millions of people in Hubei, Hunan, and on both sides of the Jingjiang River are very happy. They cheer our great leader Chairman Mao, who has permanently freed them from historical disasters and arranged a beautiful and happy life for them.

    Dear Comrades: I want to tell you how this great project was completed. As everyone knows, the project was vast, the time was tight, transportation was inconvenient, there were not many people in the project area, our technical level and conditions were not good enough, we lacked experience, the preparation time was very short, there were many rainy days in the summer, and the weather was hot. In short, there were many difficulties. This was the characteristic of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. However, floods were expected in July, and the project had to be completed before the flood season. In order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "strive for the victory of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project for the benefit of the broad masses of people," the construction army composed of 100,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers and 200,000 workers, farmers, technicians, and cadres participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project went all out and resolutely struggled to realize Chairman Mao's instruction. We also received strong assistance and support from the people of the whole country, especially the people of Hunan and Hubei, and the help of Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov. The Party, government, military, and people at all levels in the Central Government, Central-South Region, Wuhan, Hubei, and Hunan, as well as representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and representatives of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China, constantly comforted and encouraged us, which further increased our courage, confidence, and determination. We first solved the problems of housing, tools, food, and hygiene for 300,000 people, then solved the problems of various materials and transportation tools required for the project, and then solved the problems of organization, labor, and technology. This enabled us to carry out modern, new, and solid water conservancy projects. We prepared while constructing, did while learning, planned while revising, and fought to overcome nature and difficulties with a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm and revolutionary heroism, relying on the strength of the broad masses of people. Under the slogans of "Only success is allowed, failure is not allowed" and "Only advance is allowed, delay is not allowed," we worked day and night, actively labored regardless of weather, and constantly improved operating methods, treating construction like war and mobilizing the rear like supporting the front line, finally winning time, overcoming difficulties, achieving the requirements of good quality, speed, and economy, and completing the task.

    For example, we were able to pour more than 5,800 cubic meters of concrete in one day; load and unload more than 20,000 tons of materials in one day; and transport more than 2 cubic meters of earth per person per day on average within a distance of 800 meters. Some individuals were able to transport 15 cubic meters of earth within 8 hours over a distance of 127 meters. The speed of silt removal was increased from one bucket every three minutes to one bucket every three seconds. In the construction process, we broke away from the conservative thinking of copying capitalist countries and the old China, adopted a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, widely launched rationalization proposals, and discovered many innovations. We learned the one-line towing method in shipping, the artificial method of washing stones, washing sand, and mixing concrete instead of machines, revised the design of the gate bottom plate, and created a new installation method for the gate. We used various inventions to improve tools and operating methods. These inventions were not just a few dozen, but hundreds and thousands, not just individual improvements, but collective creations of the masses, demonstrating not only a high degree of labor but also unlimited wisdom. Therefore, this project produced tens of thousands of heroes and models, hundreds of model units, which improved the efficiency of various projects such as ironwork, steel reinforcement, cement, earth, wood, sand, stone, dump trucks, and shipping by one to several times, creating new records in Chinese engineering history, exceeding the efficiency of any capitalist country's engineering, and learning the socialist labor attitude and labor enthusiasm. This has made a significant contribution not only to water conservancy projects but also to other constructions of the motherland. These are all brilliant achievements of the workers, farmers, and the People's Liberation Army in this project, under the leadership of the Party, displaying great organizational power, solidarity, and creativity, and working together.

    Dear Comrades: Here, we must also especially tell you that our 100,000-strong engineering unit of the People's Liberation Army, under the correct leadership and constant encouragement of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Central-South Military Region, played a leading role in this project. They realized that to completely stop war and defend lasting world peace, we must have a modernized national defense force. And the material foundation of a strong national defense force is the modernization of heavy industry; and the construction of heavy industry must have abundant agricultural production and sufficient industrial raw materials. Economic construction and strengthening national defense are closely linked as a whole. Without a strong economic foundation, there is no way to strengthen the national defense force; without a strong national defense force, it is impossible to defend peace, impossible to stop war, impossible to defend the security of the motherland, and impossible to make the economic construction of the motherland advance by leaps and bounds. Therefore, the relationship between war and construction was resolved, the problem of the combat team and the working team was resolved, the production struggle was combined with the class struggle, and politics was combined with technology, giving full play to the organization, discipline, heroic, and tenacious combat style of the People's Liberation Army. In addition, there were many Party members, League members, and young people, who played an active leading role, a shock role, and a role in persisting in completing the task in this project, treating work as fighting a war and treating construction and digging earth as digging trenches. They believed that carrying one more load of earth or doing one more piece of work was equivalent to eliminating one more enemy. For example, in the project of cutting off Huangtian Lake, they overcame amazing difficulties. Huangtian Lake was a large mud pit, in which seven-tenths of the silt was rotten plant fiber, and there were wild water chestnuts with piercing thorns all over the lake. One of our battalions, with more than 600 soldiers, went down for a day, and more than 510 people were pricked, and 24 people tore their feet. Because of insufficient technical conditions and lack of new tools and machines, even primitive tools were sometimes lacking, so they replaced silt removal tools with basins, bundles of cloth, and buckets. Some people dug silt with their hands, and some used their bodies to block the mud. At the beginning, the weather was cold and the water was cold, and they fought naked in the mud. The shells and water chestnut thorns in the mud pierced their hands and feet, but they still insisted on working and maintained a full spirit. According to the statistics of one company, 100% suffered minor injuries and bleeding, 25% had suppuration and inflammation after being pricked, and 25% drank stinky water and silt. Sometimes, because of the storm, the sheds were blown down, so they were exposed to the mud all night. They also treated the rush repair of the Hudu River dam as eliminating the enemy, advancing from both the east and west banks of the Hudu River, simultaneously building bridges and opening roads upstream and downstream in the river, so that the superior forces could be deployed and used, in order to implement east-west pincer attacks and attacks from all sides, and seek to first open a corridor, and then develop in depth, height, and thickness on the corridor. That is how they challenged and responded to the challenge, and struggled to complete the task. In their work, there were truly great and enthusiastic moving scenes everywhere, lively and tense songs of love for the motherland and amazing sounds of victory everywhere. They said, "Rain cannot wash away the determination of heroes, and wind cannot cool the enthusiasm of heroes," "Fighting and labor have tempered our iron hearts, and no difficulties can stop the People's Liberation Army." These aroused the respect and admiration of the worker and farmer brothers, who said, "Where there is an army, there can be victory." Some regiments completed ten days' worth of tasks in seven days, some battalions completed the tasks of a regiment, and some companies completed the tasks of a battalion. The average labor efficiency of a PLA soldier was approximately equal to two to three civilian workers. For the sake of the construction of the motherland, they have initially learned various technologies in a short period of time, and they will become a strong construction army of the motherland. This force is a combat hero on the battlefield and a labor model in construction.

    Dear Comrades: I would also like to tell you that Comrade Wang Qi, the platoon leader who participated in the silt removal of Huangtian Lake, is a model Party member. Because he had fought too many battles in the past, he was weak and ill, but he did not hesitate in the face of difficult tasks and was equally brave, leading the entire platoon into the chest-deep silt. His whole body was wounded by water chestnut thorns, and the blood stained the lake water around him red. Like on the battlefield, he insisted on not leaving the front line, and like commanding operations, he went wherever it was most dangerous. Once, he was trapped in silt that was as deep as his shoulders. When the soldiers dragged their beloved platoon leader to the shore, he was unconscious. After artificial respiration and first aid, he only drank two bowls of boiled water and jumped back into the chest-deep silt to continue working. Another example is Company Commander Wei Yutao, who is also a Party member and has been awarded ten major merits. He led a "vanguard squad" and created amazing results in carrying earth. Although he worked the same as the soldiers every day, he also took care of the soldiers' fatigue after work, burned water for the soldiers to wash their feet, and even stayed up all night to cover the soldiers with quilts and hang mosquito nets. Another example is Comrade Zhang De of the artillery company, who is also a Party member. He is a young squad leader, a combat hero, a work model, and a study model, and has been awarded two major merits. He created an excellent record of removing 2.2 cubic meters of silt in one day, and the squad he led created the highest record in the entire regiment in various projects. There are too many similar heroes and models to mention. It was with such heroic spirit that the commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army, together with all the workers, farmers, and other employees participating in the flood diversion, persisted in their efforts and finally victoriously completed this great project of Jingjiang flood diversion.

    Dear Comrades! The reason why we were able to do this is all because of the leadership of Chairman Mao. The victory of the Jingjiang flood diversion is the victory of the Party.

    Dear Comrades! On the occasion of commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Party, we should not be arrogant or complacent, but strive to study Mao Zedong Thought to improve ourselves and strive to contribute more to the motherland and the Party. We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies, further unite, and fight to defeat American imperialism and all aggressors, defend peace, build a great new China, and accelerate the march of the motherland towards a socialist and communist society.

    庆祝荆江分洪工程胜利完工
    荆江分洪总指挥　唐天际亲爱的全国劳动人民、英勇的中国人民志愿军、中国人民解放军全体同志们：
    当此中国共产党诞生三十一周年纪念日，我以极大的兴奋和愉快的心情，向我党和中国人民领袖毛主席祝贺，祝贺我党的伟大、正确、光荣，并向你们报告祖国建设的一件大喜事，这件大喜事就是荆江分洪工程已经胜利地完成了。
    荆江分洪工程从今年四月五日起全面动工。六月二十日已全部完成了。这一工程的主要内容是：在长江中游湖北沙市南北段的荆江东岸，把长达一百三十三公里的荆江大堤培修加固；在荆江西岸及虎渡河以东、藕池口安乡河西北，方圆九百二十多平方公里的地方，建筑一个大水库，可容纳六十亿立方公尺的洪水；在水库的北面，江陵县的太平口，建筑一座五十四孔长达一千零五十四公尺的进洪闸；在水库的南面石首县黄山头，建筑一座三十二孔长达三百三十六公尺的节制闸，把危害人民的荆江洪水控制起来。这一个规模浩大的工程，必须完成土方工程、混凝土工程、砌石工程共约一千万公方，钢筋工程数万吨，运输器材、工具、粮秣等一亿余吨公里。此外，尚有许多附属工程，如修筑轻便铁道一百三十多公里，公路九十多公里，等等。这个工程是在毛主席的伟大号召和英明决策下，按照中央人民政府政务院、中南军政委员会所批准的计划进行的。我们把三个月的工程计划，缩短了十五天，而以两个半月的时间，完成了这一伟大艰巨的任务。这一工程的完成，免除了荆江两岸人民的灾难，保证了他们生命财产的安全，和数百万亩良田的丰收，并且极有利于长江航运和全国交通。因此，现在湖北、湖南和荆江两岸的千百万人民非常喜欢，他们欢呼我们的伟大领袖毛主席，使他们永久摆脱了历史灾难，为他们安排了美好的幸福生活。
    亲爱的同志们：我要告诉你们这个伟大的工程是怎样完成的。大家知道，工程浩大，时间紧迫，交通不便，工程地区的群众不多，我们的技术水平和技术条件还很不够，缺乏经验，准备时间很短，夏季雨日很多，天气又热，总之，困难重重，这是荆江分洪工程的特点。但是七月要发洪水，工程一定要在汛前完成。为了执行毛主席“为广大人民利益，争取荆江分洪工程的胜利”的指示，我们参加荆江分洪工程的十万人民解放军和二十万工人、农民、技师、干部所组成的建设大军，就不顾一切地全力以赴，为实现毛主席的指示而坚决奋斗。我们又取得了全国人民特别是两湖人民的大力援助和支持，取得了苏联水利专家布可夫同志的帮助。中央、中南、武汉、湖北、湖南各级党、政、军、民和中国人民志愿军代表、朝鲜人民访华代表团代表，不断慰问和鼓舞我们，我们的勇气、信心、决心就更高更大了。我们首先解决了三十万人的工棚、工具和吃饭卫生问题，其次是解决了工程所需各种器材和运输工具等问题，再次解决了组织劳作和技术问题，这样就能够进行现代化的、新式的、坚固的水利工程了。我们是一面准备，一面施工，一面做，一面学，一面计划，一面修正，以高度的爱国主义的劳动热忱和革命英雄主义的创造精神，以广大群众的力量，为战胜自然，战胜困难而斗争。在“只准成功不准失败”，“只准提前不准推后”的口号下，夜以继日，不分晴雨积极劳作和不断的改善操作方法，把建设如同战争一样，把后方动员如同支援前线一样，终于争取了时间，克服了困难，做到了好、快、节省的要求，完成了任务。
    例如：我们一天能打成混凝土五千八百多公方；一天能起卸物资两万多吨；在八百公尺距离内，每人每天平均能运二公方多土，有的一个人在一百二十七公尺距离八小时以内，能运十五公方土；排淤由三分钟排一桶提高到三秒钟排一桶。我们在施工中打破了抄袭资本主义国家的与旧中国的老一套的保守思想，采取了革命的精神革命的办法，普遍展开合理化建议，发现了许多的创造，在航运中学会一列式的拖带法。人工代替机器的洗石法、淘沙法、拌混凝土法，修正了闸底板设计及创造了闸门新的装制法，用各种发明创造改进工具，改善操作方法。这种发明创造，不是几件几十件，而是几百件几千件，不仅是个人的改进，而且是群众的集体创造，不仅表现了高度的劳作，而且表现了无限的智慧。所以这次工程中产生了上万的英雄模范，数百个模范单位，使各种工程，如铁工、钢筋、水泥、土、木、沙、石、斗车、船舶运输均提高了工效一倍至几倍，创造了中国工程史上的新纪录，超过了任何资本主义国家的工程效率，学习了社会主义的劳动态度和劳动热情。这不仅在水利工程上有重大贡献，并将对祖国其他建设亦有重大贡献。这都是工人、农民和人民解放军在这一次工程中，在党的领导下，发挥了伟大的组织力，团结力和创造力，通力合作的光辉成就。
    亲爱的同志们：在这里我们还要特别告诉大家的就是我们的人民解放军十万工程部队在毛主席、朱总司令和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会、中南军区的正确领导和不断的鼓舞下，在这次工程中起了主力作用。他们认识到要彻底制止战争，保卫世界持久和平，必须有近代化国防力量。而强大的国防力量的物质基础，则是近代化的重工业建设；而重工业的兴建，又必须要有丰裕的农业生产，充足的工业原料。经济建设与巩固国防是密切相联的整体。没有强大的经济基础，就谈不到国防力量的加强，没有强大的国防力量，就不可能保卫和平，就不可能制止战争，就不可能保卫祖国的安全，就不可能使祖国的经济建设大踏步的前进。因此解决了战争与建设的关系，解决了战斗队与工作队的问题，把生产斗争与阶级斗争结合起来了，把政治与技术结合起来了，发挥了人民解放军的组织性纪律性，英勇顽强的战斗作风。加之党员、团员、青年很多，他们在这次工程中起了积极的带头作用、突击作用、坚持完成的作用，把做工当成打仗一样，把施工挖土当成做工事挖战壕一样，他们认为多挑一担土多做一件工就等于多消灭一个敌人。例如腰斩黄天湖的工程中，他们克服了令人惊奇的困难。黄天湖是一个大泥潭，里面的淤泥十分之七是腐烂植物的纤维，并且有满湖刺人的野菱角。我们有一个营六百多个战士下去一天，有五百一十多个人被扎了刺，二十四个人拉破了脚。他们因技术条件不够，缺乏新式工具、机器，甚至于原始工具有时也缺乏，就以脸盆、包袱皮、水桶代替排淤工具，有的用手扒淤泥，有的用身子挡泥浆，开始时天寒水冷，赤身在淤泥中搏斗，淤泥中蚌壳、菱角刺破了手足还在坚持工作，还始终保持饱满情绪。据有一个连的统计，百分之百负轻伤流血，百分之二十五扎破后化脓发炎，百分之二十五喝了臭水淤泥。有时因暴风雨把工棚刮倒，以致整晚置身在泥浆中。他们又在抢修虎渡河坝中，也当作消灭敌人一样，从虎渡河东西两岸多路进兵，从河里上下游同时搭桥、开辟道路，使优势兵力摆得开用得上，以便实行东西夹击，四面夹攻，求得首先打通一条走廊，然后在走廊上向纵深向高向厚发展。他们就是这样来挑战应战，为完成任务而奋斗。在他们的工作中，真是处处有伟大而热烈动人的场面，处处有活泼紧张热爱祖国的劳动歌声和惊人的胜利的捷音，他们说：“雨淋不掉英雄的决心，风吹不冷英雄的热情”，“战斗、劳动炼成了我们铁的心，任何困难挡不住解放军”。这些引起了工农兄弟们的尊敬与钦佩，他们说：“那里有军队那里就能胜利”。有的团七天完成十天任务，有的营完成一个团的任务，有的连完成一个营的任务。部队平均一个劳动力的工效约等于民工两个至三个。为着祖国建设，他们在短短的时间内，已初步的学会各种技术，他们将成为祖国一支坚强的建设大军。这支力量在战场上是战斗英雄，在建设上是劳动模范。
    亲爱的同志们：我还要告诉你们的是参加黄天湖排淤的排长王起同志，他是个模范党员，因过去作战太多以致体弱多病，但是他在艰苦任务面前毫不犹豫，同样勇敢，带领全排跳进齐胸的淤泥之中，他浑身被菱角刺伤，鲜血染红了身边的湖水，他像在战场上一样坚持不下火线，他像指挥作战一样哪里最危险，就去哪里。有一次他陷进深及双肩淤泥之中，当战士把他们敬爱的排长拖上湖岸时，他已不省人事，经过人工呼吸与急救之后，他仅喝了两碗开水，又跳进了齐胸的淤泥继续工作。又如连长魏玉桃，他也是个党员，立过十大功，他率领了一个“尖刀班”，创造了惊人的挑土成绩，他虽然每天与战士们一样劳动，但在收工后他还照顾战士疲劳，烧水给战士洗脚，甚至通宵不睡，为战士们盖被子，挂蚊帐。再如炮兵连的张德同志，他也是个党员，他是年青的班长，又是战斗英雄，又是工作模范、学习模范，立过两大功，他创造了一天排淤两点二公方的优越纪录，他领导的班在各种工程中创造了全团最高纪录。类似这些英雄模范人物，真是不胜枚举的。我们人民解放军的指战员们，就是以这样的英雄主义精神和参加分洪的全体工人、农民及其他员工们一起坚持努力，终于胜利完成了荆江分洪这一伟大工程的。
    亲爱的同志们！我们之所以能够如此，这都是在毛主席领导之下而获得的，荆江分洪的胜利，就是党的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们！在纪念党的三十一周年的时候，我们应不骄不傲，努力学习毛泽东思想来提高我们，争取为祖国为党多贡献一份力量，我们坚决执行毛主席的指示和党的方针，进一步团结起来，为战胜美帝国主义和一切侵略者，保卫和平，建设伟大的新中国，使祖国加速向社会主义共产主义的社会迈进而奋斗。
