    The Cooperative Enterprise in the Central South Region Continues to Develop
    The continuously developing cooperatives in the Central South region have played an important role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and meeting the needs of cooperative members. At present, 6,850 grassroots cooperatives have been established in the entire Central South region, with more than 26 million members, accounting for 16.6 percent of the total population of the region. Compared with 1950, the number of grassroots cooperatives has increased two and a half times, and the number of members has increased twenty times. With the continuous development of organizations, the proportion of cooperatives in the social economy has been increasing day by day. This spring, the fertilizers supplied by cooperatives to farmers accounted for 23.7 percent of the total fertilizer needed by farmers in the region for the whole year; now cooperatives in various places have begun to supply summer fertilizers in large quantities. In terms of supplying agricultural tools, the Henan Province Cooperative alone sold 1.3 million pieces of agricultural tools from last winter to this summer. Cooperatives in many places have also purchased large quantities of local products from farmers.

    Henan Province Opens Up Sales Channels for Local and Special Products; Urban and Rural Economies Become Increasingly Active
    More than three-quarters of the local and special products accumulated in Henan Province this spring, with a total value of 200 billion yuan, have been sold. The proportion of unsalable products decreased from 32 percent in March to 12 percent in May. As a result, the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased, and the urban and rural economies are becoming increasingly active.

    In order to organize the exchange of local products, leadership organs at all levels in Henan Province have held many meetings to make arrangements. In April of this year, the Provincial People's Government convened a provincial economic conference, where it studied the three types of local products: fast-selling, fair-selling, and slow-selling. Based on the supply and demand of local products in various regions, it organized industrial and commercial trade departments in various regions to sign transaction contracts and carried out the exchange of local products throughout the province. After the meeting, special districts, cities, and counties generally held similar economic conferences or local product purchasing and sales conferences. People's governments in various places also paid attention to guiding old-fashioned markets such as temple fairs and general merchandise mule and horse fairs in rural areas, mobilizing local state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants to make transactions at the fairs, opening up sales channels for local and special products.

    Shixia Wenguang Mutual Aid Team in Linxia Successfully Trials Ukrainian Wheat
    The Shi Wenguang Mutual Aid Team in Huangjiazhaizi Township, a suburb of Linxia City, has successfully trialed Ukrainian wheat from the Soviet Union. Last year, with the help of the Linxia Special District Farm, the team trialed 1.5 mu of Ukrainian wheat, and this year it harvested a total of 864 jin; if planted more densely, it could have harvested even more. The climate in the Linxia area is relatively cold, and in the past, farmers believed that it was not suitable for planting winter wheat. Also, because there are often strong winds and heavy rain before the wheat harvest, the wheat is prone to "lodging," which reduces yields. Therefore, in the past, farmers in Linxia rarely planted winter wheat. Ukrainian wheat is a good wheat variety that is cold-resistant, drought-resistant, has stiff stalks that do not "lodge," is resistant to disease, and has a high yield. The news of the successful trial of the Shi Wenguang Mutual Aid Team has spread rapidly in the local area, and farmers in various places are requesting to exchange for the Ukrainian wheat seeds of the Shi Wenguang Mutual Aid Team.

    中南区合作事业不断发展
    在不断发展中的中南区合作社，对于开展城乡物资交流，满足社员需要起了重要作用。现在中南全区已建立基层合作社六千八百五十个，社员共有二千六百多万人，占全区总人口百分之十六点六。和一九五零年比较，基层合作社增加了两倍半，社员增加了二十倍。随着组织的不断发展，合作社在社会经济中的比重已日益增加。今春合作社供给农民的肥料，占全区农民全年所需肥料的百分之二十三点七；现在各地合作社又开始大量供应夏季肥料。供应农具方面，单是河南省合作社从去冬到今夏就销出了农具一百三十万件。许多地方的合作社并收购了农民的大批土产。
    河南省打开土特产品销路城乡经济日趋活跃
    河南省今春积存的总值二千亿元的土产、特产，已销出四分之三以上。滞销产品的比例从三月份的百分之三十二降低到五月份的百分之十二。因此，农民购买力已大为提高，城乡经济日趋活跃。
    河南省各级领导机关为了组织土产交流，曾召开许多会议进行布置。省人民政府在今年四月间召开了全省经济会议，在会上研究了畅销、行销、滞销三种类型的土产，并根据各地土产的供求情况，组织各地区工商贸易部门签订交易合同，在全省范围内进行土产交流。会后，各专区、市、县普遍举行了类似的经济会议或土产购销会议。各地人民政府并注意领导农村中庙会、百货骡马大会等旧有的市集，发动当地国营贸易公司、合作社和私商在会上成交，打开了土特产品的销路。
    临夏石文光互助组试种乌克兰小麦成功
    临夏市城郊黄家榨乡石文光互助组试种苏联乌克兰小麦成功。去年，该组在临夏专区农场的帮助下，试种了一亩五分乌克兰小麦，今年共收了八百六十四斤；如果种得密些还可多收。临夏地区气候较寒，过去农民认为不宜种冬麦，又因麦收前往往风多雨多，麦子容易“倒伏”，因而减产。因此，过去临夏农民很少播种冬麦。乌克兰小麦正是耐寒抗旱、杆硬不“倒伏”、抗病能力强、产量高的好麦种。石文光互助组试种成功的消息已在当地迅速传开，各地农民都要求换石文光互助组的乌克兰小麦种。
