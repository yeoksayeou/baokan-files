    The American People Fight Against War Policies and Fascist Rule
    Tan Wenrui
    It has been a year since the reactionary American government illegally imprisoned the leaders of the American Communist Party, Dennis, and six others. This fascist atrocity by the American government has aroused immense indignation and protest from the American people and the people of the world. All righteous people around the world agree that the American government's barbaric persecution of the leaders of the American Communist Party is not only an attack on the democratic rights of the American people, but also a shameless provocation against the world's forces of peace.
    As Dennis pointed out a year ago, the only "crime" of the American Communist leaders is that "they advocate peace and social progress, and they oppose war and fascism." The reason why the American government fabricated charges against the American Communist leaders and imprisoned them was simply to suppress the American people's struggle for peace and democracy, and to try to accelerate America's path towards war and fascism. In the year since Dennis and the other six were imprisoned, the reactionary ruling clique in the United States has become even more intensified in strengthening its fascist rule and pursuing its aggressive war policies.
    In the past year, the reactionary American government has continued its brutal persecution of the American Communist Party and progressive forces. Disregarding the protests of the American people, the American judicial authorities refused to accept the appeal of the American Communist leaders and upheld their illegal sentences. With the help of its lackey, the Mexican government, the American government illegally arrested the Secretary of the American Communist Party, Hall, in the Mexican capital last October, and continued to hunt down the remaining three American Communist leaders. Under the smokescreen of anti-communist hysteria, while the so-called "Un-American Activities Committee" continues to conduct its notorious "loyalty investigations" and constantly fabricate unfounded "espionage conspiracy cases" to persecute progressive people, another so-called "Subversive Activities Control Board" is doing everything possible to defame the American Communist Party, trying to slander it as a "foreign-controlled organization" and plotting further suppression. The American judicial authorities, based on the so-called "Smith Act," have arrested a large number of leading cadres of the American Communist Party, trade union leaders, and well-known figures in the peace movement, subjecting them to shameful "trials" and sentencing them to imprisonment; special agents search people's homes at will, and are constructing large-scale concentration camps. Thus, the United States has completely become a fascist police state.
    While strengthening its fascist rule, the reactionary ruling clique in the United States has stepped up its preparations for war and aggression, in order to promote its wild plan to dominate the world. The American military budget for 1952-1953 reached a staggering 81.8 billion, and the number of armed forces has expanded to more than five million. In Korea, the American aggressors continue to delay and disrupt the negotiations in order to maintain the tense situation; in order to revive Japanese and West German militarism, the United States coerced its puppet states into signing a separate peace treaty with Japan last year, which came into effect in April of this year; recently, it signed the so-called "General Treaty" on rearming West Germany with Britain, France, and the Adenauer government, and is stepping up the organization of a "European Army" dominated by West German troops. In addition, the United States is frantically expanding and establishing new military bases everywhere in Western Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia, while strengthening its occupation and control over various puppet states, and openly interfering in the liberation wars of the people of Malaya and Vietnam. The American aggressors are also conducting inhumane bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. These crimes of the American aggressors have aroused the universal hatred of all righteous mankind, including the American people.
    The war cries of the reactionary ruling clique in the United States and its aggressive measures threaten the peace and security of all mankind, but they have not frightened the peace-loving people of all countries; the American policy of aggressive war has been opposed and hit everywhere by the people. Similarly, the violent and terrorist means of the reactionary ruling clique in the United States at home cannot destroy the fighting will of the American Communist Party and the American people. The National Committee of the American Communist Party issued a statement after the leaders of the American Communist Party were persecuted last year, pointing out: "We Communists are determined to stand our ground. We will fight for our rights and the rights of all the people—black and white. ... We Communists will never yield to the warmongers. We must continue to unite millions upon millions in the practical struggle for peace." In the past year, under extremely difficult circumstances, the American Communist Party has continued to lead the American people in their struggle against Wall Street's policies of war, poverty, and fascism. The leaders of the American Communist Party and many peace defenders have been thrown into prison, but the broad masses of the American people, inspired by their heroic actions, have plunged into the struggle for peace and democracy. People from all walks of life in the United States have continuously held mass rallies and demonstrations, demanding an end to the Korean War, demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, demanding a ban on atomic weapons, and opposing bacteriological warfare. The American people have further united in the struggle for peace and have formed national peace movement organizations such as the "American Peace Crusade" and the "American Youth Crusade." More and more American working people have realized that the decline in their living standards and the deprivation of their democratic rights are inseparable from Wall Street's war policies, and they are not only using strike actions to fight for their economic and political rights, but also actively participating in the movement to defend peace. "We want peace, not war" has become the unanimous call of the American working people.
    Despite the reactionary American government's continued frantic fascist suppression and persecution of the American Communist Party, the American Communist Party still holds high the banner of fighting for peace and democracy, leading the American people in their struggle, and is therefore increasingly gaining the support and love of the American people. People from all walks of life in the United States have become increasingly aware that only the Communist Party is the true defender of their interests. The facts of the past year have proved that as long as the American people resolutely unite around the American Communist Party, stand together with the peace-loving people of the world, and continue to struggle, they will surely be able to defeat Wall Street's war policies and its fascist rule.

    美国人民为反对战争政策及法西斯统治而斗争
    谭文瑞
    美国反动政府非法地把美国共产党的领袖但尼斯等七人投入监狱已经一年了。美国政府这一法西斯暴行曾激起美国人民和世界人民的无比愤慨和抗议。全世界正义人民一致认为，美国政府对美共领袖的野蛮迫害不仅是对于美国人民民主权利的进攻，而且是对于世界和平力量的无耻挑衅。
    正如但尼斯在一年前所指出的，美共领袖们唯一的“罪状”就是“他们主张和平与社会进步，他们反对战争与法西斯主义”。美国政府所以对美共领袖加以莫须有的罪名，并把他们关进监狱，只是为了要镇压美国人民争取和平、民主的斗争，企图使美国加速走向战争与法西斯的道路。在但尼斯等七人入狱一年以来，美国反动统治集团对于加强它的法西斯统治和推行侵略战争政策是更为变本加厉了。
    在过去一年中，美国反动政府继续对美国共产党和进步力量进行横暴的迫害。美国司法当局不顾美国人民的抗议，拒绝受理美共领袖的上诉而维持其非法判决。美国政府并借其走狗墨西哥政府之助，于去年十月在墨西哥首都非法逮捕了美共书记霍尔，同时继续搜捕其余的三位美共领袖。在反共歇斯底里的烟幕下，当所谓“非美活动委员会”还在继续进行臭名远扬的“忠诚调查”和不断制造无中生有的“间谍阴谋案”以迫害进步人士的时候，另外一个所谓“颠覆活动管制委员”便用尽办法诽谤美国共产党，力图诬蔑它为“受外国控制的组织”阴谋进行更进一步的镇压。美国的司法当局根据所谓“史密斯法案”大批逮捕美共领导干部、工会领袖与和平运动的著名人士，对他们进行可耻的“审讯”，并判罪下狱；特务随便搜查人民的住所，并正加工构筑大规模的集中营。由此美国已彻底变成一个法西斯的警察国家了。
    在加强法西斯统治的同时，美国的反动统治集团加紧了它的备战和侵略步骤，以推行其独霸世界的狂妄计划。美国一九五二至一九五三年度的军事预算达到了八百一十八亿的庞大数字，武装部队的数目扩增到五百万人以上。在朝鲜，美国侵略者不断拖延和破坏谈判，以保持紧张局势；为了复活日本和西德的军国主义，美国于去年胁迫它的仆从国签订了单独的对日和约，并于今年四月宣布生效；最近又与英法两国与阿登纳政府签订重新武装西德的所谓“一般性条约”，并加紧组织以西德军队为主力的“欧洲军”。此外，美国一方面在西欧、中东、北非和东南亚各处拚命扩充和建立新的军事基地，一方面加强对各仆从国家的占领和控制，公开地干涉马来亚和越南人民的解放战争。美国侵略者并对中朝人民进行灭绝人性的细菌战。美国侵略者的这种种罪行已引起了包括美国人民在内的全体正义人类的普遍仇恨。
    美国反动统治集团的战争叫嚣和它的侵略措施威胁着全人类的和平与安全，但是并没有吓倒各国爱好和平的人民；美国的侵略战争政策到处遭到人民的反对和打击。同样，美国反动统治集团在国内的暴力与恐怖手段并不能摧毁美国共产党和美国人民的斗争意志。美国共产党全国委员会在去年美共领袖遭受迫害之后就发表声明，指出：“我们共产党人决坚守自己的立场。我们将为自己的权利以及全体人民——黑人与白人——的权利而奋斗。……我们共产党人决不向战争贩子屈膝。我们要继续团结千百万人，进行争取和平的实际斗争。”一年以来美国共产党在极端困难的情况下，继续领导美国人民进行斗争，反对华尔街的战争、贫困与法西斯政策。美共的领袖和许多和平保卫者被关进了监狱，而广大的美国人民却在他们的英勇行动鼓舞下，投入了争取和平与民主的斗争。各阶层的美国人民不断举行群众性的集会和示威，要求停止朝鲜战争，要求缔结五大国和平公约，要求禁用原子武器，反对细菌战。美国人民在争取和平的斗争中已进一步团结起来，并组成了“美国和平十字军”、“美国青年十字军”等全国性的和平运动组织。愈来愈多的美国劳动人民已认识到他们生活水平的下降与民主权利的被剥夺，是和华尔街的战争政策分不开的，他们不但用罢工的行动争取他们的经济和政治权利，而且积极地参加了保卫和平的运动。“要和平，不要战争”已成为美国劳动人民的一致呼声。
    尽管美国反动政府对美国共产党继续进行着疯狂的法西斯镇压和迫害，但是美国共产党仍然高举着争取和平民主的旗帜，领导着美国人民进行斗争，并因此而日益得到美国人民的拥护和爱戴。美国各阶层人民已更加认清，只有共产党才是他们利益的真正保卫者。一年来的事实证明：美国人民只要坚决地团结在美国共产党的周围，与全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，继续进行斗争，就一定能够击败华尔街的战争政策和它的法西斯统治。
