The editorial said: While ensuring the consolidated unity of the working people headed by the working class and other democratic forces, the Chinese Communist Party has grown into a decisive leading force in striving for the victory of the Chinese revolution.

The eternal friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China is unbreakable. It is a strong guarantee for the victory of the Korean anti-aggression war, and also a great example for the people of all countries to rise up to defend world peace and security, and to strive for national liberation.

The editorial first introduced to the Vietnamese people the glorious victory achieved by the Chinese Communist Party in the past thirty-one years by correctly leading the Chinese people in their heroic struggle with the theory of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution - Mao Zedong Thought. The editorial then called on the Vietnamese people and all members of the Vietnamese Labor Party to sincerely learn from the Chinese Communist Party, especially the infinitely rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party in military, political, and economic fields, and to learn well the noble character of the Chinese Communist Party members who are loyal and unyielding, resolute and courageous, and dedicated to serving the people throughout their lives.

The editorial concluded: The great October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the Chinese revolution have successively won brilliant and tremendous achievements, which more clearly shows that only under the leadership of the working class can the people's revolution achieve true victory. The world peace and democracy camp, which consists of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries with a population of 800 million, is the strongest and most reliable force for defending world peace and democracy.

    社论指出：朝鲜劳动党领导下的全朝鲜人民，和中国共产党领导下的中国人民，在抗击人类的共同敌人新战争挑拨者——美国侵略者的斗争中，已进一步地巩固了他们在历史上结成的兄弟般的友谊团结。中国人民不仅以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民，而且高举抗美援朝保家卫国的旗帜，广泛地展开了支援前线的运动。朝中两国人民之间的永恒的友谊团结是牢不可破的。它是朝鲜反侵略战争取得胜利的坚强保障，也是各国人民奋起保卫世界持久和平与安全，以及争取民族解放的伟大榜样。社论最后说：全朝鲜人民迎接伟大的中国共产党创建三十一周年的光荣的纪念日，再次满怀信心地要进一步加强与中国人民的永恒友谊，在反侵略战争中争取更加伟大的胜利。在抗击共同敌人的斗争中以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民永恒的战斗友谊万岁！
