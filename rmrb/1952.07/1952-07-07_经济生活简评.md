    Implement New Technical Measures

    The decision made by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the implementation of light sizing for cotton cloth, the elimination of sizing for printed and dyed fabrics, and the simplification of decoration for cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics is an extremely important measure for increasing production and practicing economy in the textile industry.

    The nationwide promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method in textile factories has already increased the production and quality of yarn and cloth, saved a large amount of raw materials, and accumulated a large amount of wealth for the country. However, in China's weaving and dyeing industry, there still remain technical standards and management styles left over from the old society, which cause significant waste. In cotton cloth production, due to the inherited habits of heavy sizing for grey cloth and sizing for colored cloth, more than 400,000 bags of flour and more than 2 million catties of oil are wasted every year. Many weaving and dyeing departments pursue beautiful cloth decoration, competing to deceive customers with brightly colored trademarks, often affixing and printing many colored trademark papers on the cloth. It is estimated that the trademark cost for each piece of cloth is about three to four thousand yuan.

    The decisions passed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council aim to overcome the above waste phenomena and reform the old production quotas and management styles. If weaving and dyeing departments across the country can implement these new technical measures, they can increase production and save 360 billion yuan for the country every year. Moreover, after implementing these measures, the quality of the cloth can be further improved.

    In the booming movement of increasing production and practicing economy, the workers and technicians of weaving and dyeing factories across the country are eager to improve their operating techniques and increase production and save more wealth for the country. They warmly welcome these new measures. However, because some workers and technicians still have conservative ideas, and the general public does not yet understand the significance of light sizing for grey cloth, no sizing for colored cloth, and simplified trademarks, some ideological obstacles will inevitably be encountered in the process of promoting these new measures. Cadres of various textile factories, textile management bureaus, and trade departments should immediately use various methods to carry out propaganda and education to workers and citizens, so that everyone fully understands its important significance, in order to thoroughly implement these new measures.

    In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to promptly solve various difficulties in technical equipment. The technicians of various weaving and dyeing departments must unite closely with the workers to jointly study and solve the technical problems that arise.

    Reasonable Suggestions from the Masses Should Not Be Treated with Bureaucratic Attitudes

    Leading cadres of state-owned factories and mines should treat the rationalization proposals of the working masses with the greatest enthusiasm. The leading cadres of Jinan Railway Factory did the opposite, holding up the rationalization proposals of the masses for a year, which is not allowed.

    Lian Qiu, a technician at the Jinan Railway Factory, spent three months coming up with a way to improve the manual installation of cylinder liners. He submitted this rationalization proposal to the Technical Section. The Technical Section forwarded it to the Production Planning Section. The Production Planning Section did not deal with it seriously and said: "Disagree to adopt it!" When Comrade Lian Qiu asked them about the result of the handling, they said: "Probably can be used!" This situation only shows that the Production Planning Section did not pay attention to Lian Qiu's suggestion at all. They rudely treated the inventions and creations of the masses as child's play and put them aside casually. Not only that, the leading cadres of the Jinan Railway Factory also adopted an extremely bad attitude towards the inventions and creations of the masses. They said that the drawings drawn by the workers were "not careful enough," and they asked ordinary workers to draw the drawings carefully before sending them up; otherwise, they would ignore them. What kind of style is this! Is it not the responsibility of the Technical Section to help workers draw pictures? If ordinary workers can draw the sketches of rationalization proposals so perfectly, can't these cadres take a long rest?

    In the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, railway workers across the country used their brains to find "tricks" and put forward many rationalization proposals; leading cadres should attach great importance to and help realize these rationalization proposals, otherwise, they will commit an unforgivable crime.

　　经济生活简评
    贯彻实行新的技术措施
    政务院财政经济委员会，关于棉布实施轻浆，印染布匹取消上浆和棉布、印染布匹简化装璜的决定，是在纺织工业中实行增产节约的一项极为重要的措施。
    全国各纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法后，已经提高了纱布的产量和质量，节省了大批原材料，给国家积累了大量的财富。但是，在我国的织染工业中，至今还残存着旧社会遗留下来的技术标准和经营作风，由此造成的浪费是很大的。在棉布生产中，由于继承了陈旧的坯布上重浆和色布上浆的习惯，每年浪费面粉四十多万袋，油类二百余万斤。许多织染部门，追求布匹装璜的漂亮，竞以鲜艳的商标欺蒙顾客，常常在布匹上贴印很多彩色的商标纸。估计每匹布的商标费约需三、四千元。
    政务院财政经济委员会通过的几项决定，其目的就是要克服以上的浪费现象，改革旧的生产定额和经营作风。全国各地织染部门，如果都能实现了这些新的技术措施，每年便可给国家增产节约三千六百亿元，而且，实行了这几项措施后，还可以进一步提高布匹的质量。
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，全国各地织染厂的职工和技术人员，迫切要求改进自己的操作技术，替国家增产节约更多的财富。他们对这些新的措施，是热情欢迎的。但是，由于在部分工人和技术人员中还有着保守思想，广大市民对坯布上轻浆，色布不上浆，商标简化的意义还不了解，因此，在推行这些新措施的过程中，一定还会遇到一些思想障碍。各纺织厂、各纺织管理局和贸易部门的干部，应即运用各种方式方法，向职工和市民进行宣传教育，使大家充分了解它的重要意义，以便彻底实行这些新措施。
    为了贯彻这几项措施，必须及时解决技术设备上的种种困难。各织染部门的技术人员，要和职工紧密团结，共同研究、解决技术上所发生的问题。
    不应以官僚主义态度对待群众的合理化建议
    国营厂矿的领导干部，应该以最大的热情对待工人群众的合理化建议。济南铁路工厂的领导干部竟与此相反，把群众的合理化建议积压一年之久，这是不能允许的。
    济南铁路工厂技术员连裘，用了三个月的时间，想出改进人工安装汽缸衬套的办法。他把这种合理化建议交给技术科。技术科转给生产计划科。生产计划科没有严肃地处理，就说：“不同意采用！”连裘同志向他们询问处理的结果，他们又说：“大概可以用吧！”这种情况只说明了生产计划科根本没有重视连裘的建议，他们竟粗暴地把群众的发明创造当作儿戏，随便搁置起来了。不仅如此。济南铁路工厂领导干部也对群众的发明创造采取了极为恶劣的态度。他们说工人画的图“不仔细”，他们要求普通工人把图画得仔仔细细的再送上来；否则他们就置之不理。这是一种什么作风呀！难道技术科没有责任帮助工人画图吗？如果普通工人都把合理化建议的草图画得那么完美无瑕，这些干部不是就可以长期休息了吗？
    全国铁路职工在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，开动脑筋，寻找“窍门”，提出了许多合理化建议；领导干部应该十分重视和帮助实现这些合理化建议，否则，就是犯了不可饶恕的罪过。
