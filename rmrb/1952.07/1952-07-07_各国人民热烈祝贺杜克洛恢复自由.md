Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the French workers, warmly congratulating the French working class leader Duclos on his release. The telegram reads as follows: To the French General Confederation of Labor, and dear French worker brothers: The Chinese working class was extremely excited to hear the news that the faithful son of the French working people, Comrade Duclos, was released on July 1st. This is a major victory for the French working class and working people against the fascist measures of the Binet government and its American masters. In the face of the powerful protest movement of the people of France and the world, all the conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries have finally failed. On behalf of the Chinese working class, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to Comrade Duclos, the leader of the French working class, on his release. With domestic unity and international support, the great cause of the French working people to oppose the expansionist and war-preparing policies of US imperialism, strive for freedom and national independence, and defend world peace will surely achieve final victory.
