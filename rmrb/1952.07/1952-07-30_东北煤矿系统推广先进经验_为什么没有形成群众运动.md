Northeast Coal Mine System Promotes Advanced Experiences
Why the Promotion of Advanced Experiences in the Northeast Coal Mine System Has Not Formed a Mass Movement
Chen Gengfu, Vice Chairman of the Northeast District Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union

The Northeast District Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union convened a joint conference of trade union chairmen from various mining areas in April of this year. The conference pointed out that promoting advanced experiences is the basic method for completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy. It also required all mines to vigorously promote six advanced experiences with decisive roles and universal significance, namely: the rapid drilling experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, the rapid tunneling experience of Cui Guoshan, the safe and standardized operation experience of Shi Yuhai, the mechanized cyclical coal mining experience of Hegang, the parallel operation method of vertical shafts in Xi'an, and the bricklaying method of Su Changyou. After the meeting, the Northeast District Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, the Northeast Industrial Department, and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau organized working groups and inspection groups, and adopted methods such as visits and internships to help various mines carry out promotion work. In addition, with the efforts of the broad masses of workers and some leading cadres, the work of promoting advanced experiences has achieved certain results. Currently, the drilling teams that have responded to the challenge of the Ma Wenzhi team account for 19.6 percent of all drilling rigs in the Northeast. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau overfulfilled its drilling task for May, and the number of accident days decreased by 47 compared to April. The parallel operation method of vertical shafts in Xi'an has been started or is being prepared for promotion in several mines that are under construction. Of the 24 rapid tunneling teams under the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau, 17 have responded to the challenge of the Cui Guoshan team, and six of them have achieved a daily progress of 20 meters. In terms of mechanized coal mining, nine longwall faces with a monthly output of over 10,000 tons have emerged in May. The safe and standardized operation experience of the Shi Yuhai team is being continuously promoted. The advanced experiences of Su Changyou and Xie Wanfu have also been widely promoted in various mines, with better results in Fuxin, Jixi, and Beipiao mines. However, generally speaking, the mines have not yet formed a mass upsurge of learning and promoting advanced experiences.

What are the reasons why the promotion of advanced experiences has not truly formed a mass movement?

First, many leading cadres still lack a deep understanding of the promotion of advanced experiences and only pay lip service to the importance of advanced experiences. Therefore, general calls are more frequent, while specific ideological guidance and organizational work are rarely done. More than 40 grass-roots cadres in the Haizhou Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau shout every day about promoting the rapid tunneling experience of Ma Liuhaizi and Cui Guoshan, but many people do not know what the content of these rapid tunneling experiences is. When the Jixi Mining Bureau promoted the mechanized coal mining experience, some cadres and workers said: "We can guarantee the completion of the task without promoting mechanization." One mine even said when reporting the reason for completing the task: "Because the coal cutting machine was broken and not used, we completed the task." The leading cadres turned a blind eye to this wrong thinking and did not criticize it. For example, the rapid drilling experience of Ma Wenzhi requires the use of yellow mud slurry. The yellow soil quality of the Jixi Mining Bureau is not good. The leadership did not conduct experiments and allowed the lower levels to use it blindly, which affected the promotion of advanced experiences. By the beginning of June, none of the 20 drilling teams in the bureau had learned from Ma Wenzhi's experience. One mine proposed to vigorously promote the use of long drill rods, but the materials department did not prepare enough long drill rods for the site. According to Ma Wenzhi's advanced experience, two sets of settling pipes should be prepared for alternating use to shorten auxiliary production time, but the supply of casing has not been generally resolved in various mines. There are also such situations, such as when promoting "finished timber supports" in some mines of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, the leading cadres issued an order without careful research: "Promote them within a week, otherwise the support workers in the pit will be transferred out." As a result, the specifications of the timber supports were incorrect, and the grouping numbers were unclear. After the timber supports were sent to the underground, they still needed to be sawn off, which lost the meaning of "finished timber supports" and made the promotion of "finished timber supports" a mere formality. At the same time, the rewards for the creators of advanced experiences and those who have achieved excellent results in learning advanced experiences are generally insufficient, which also affects the promotion of advanced experiences to a certain extent.

Second, some leading cadres simply ignore the promotion of advanced experiences and even hold a confrontational attitude towards this work. For example, some units only mention the numbers of increasing production and practicing economy when formulating plans for increasing production and practicing economy, but do not mention the promotion of advanced experiences at all. Some units emphasize difficulties and are unwilling to actively carry out promotion work. Some leading cadres are arrogant and complacent, unwilling to learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal factories and mines, and are willing to create their own set of "typical experiences." Some people even think that there is nothing to learn and that it is not worth promoting without even studying the advanced experiences of others. In units with such leading ideology, it is naturally impossible to talk about how to promote advanced experiences.

In order to quickly make the promotion of advanced experiences a mass movement, the leading cadres of each unit must first correct their understanding of this work, and mobilize the broad masses of workers to study and discuss, formulate specific measures and plans for the promotion work, put forward requirements for promotion, and conduct regular inspections. In the process of promotion, effective methods such as advanced experience dissemination classes should be adopted to cultivate backbones and gain experience.

    东北煤矿系统推广先进经验
    为什么没有形成群众运动
    中国煤矿工会东北区委员会副主席  陈耕夫
    煤矿工会东北区委员会在今年四月曾经召开了各矿区工会主席联席会议，在这个会议上指出，推广先进经验是完成增产节约任务的基本方法，并要求各矿大力推广六种具有决定作用和普遍意义的先进经验，即：马文志小组快速钻探经验、崔国山快速掘进经验、施玉海安全正规作业经验、鹤岗机械化周期采煤经验、西安竖井平行作业法以及苏长有砌砖法。会后，煤矿工会东北区委员会和东北工业部以及煤矿管理局等曾先后组织了工作组、检查组，并采用参观实习等办法，分别帮助各矿开展推广工作，加上广大职工群众以及部分领导干部的努力，因而，推广先进经验的工作已经获得了一定的成绩。目前，向马文志小组应战的钻探小组所有的钻机，已占东北全部钻机的百分之十九点六。东北煤矿管理局五月份的钻探任务已经超额完成，事故日数较四月份减少四十七天。西安竖井的平行作业法在正在建设竖井的几个矿山，都已开始或正在准备推广。东北煤矿管理局所属各矿的二十四个快速掘进队，已有十七个向崔国山队应战，其中日进二十公尺的队已有六个。在机械采煤方面，五月份中已出现月产万吨以上的大掌子九个。施玉海小组的安全正规作业经验正在继续推广。苏长有和谢万福的先进经验在各矿也已经较为普遍的推广，其中阜新、鸡西、北票各矿的成绩较好。但是，就总的情况说来，各矿都还没有形成群众性的学习和推广先进经验的热潮。
    推广先进经验没有真正形成群众运动的原因何在呢？
    首先，许多领导干部到目前为止，对于推广先进经验还缺乏深刻的认识，只是空喊先进经验的重要，因而一般号召多，具体的思想领导和组织工作则作得很少。阜新矿务局海州矿四十多名基层干部，天天喊着要推广马六孩、崔国山的快速掘进经验，但是很多人并不知道这些快速掘进经验的内容是什么。鸡西矿务局在推广机械化采煤经验时，有些干部和工人讲：“不推广机械化，也保证完成任务”，有一个矿在汇报完成任务的原因时甚至说：“因为割煤机坏了没有使用，所以完成了任务”，而领导干部对这种错误思想竟然熟视无睹不加批判。又如马文志的快速钻探经验中要使用黄泥浆，鸡西矿务局黄土的土质不好，领导方面不作试验就让下面盲目使用，以至影响先进经验的推广，到六月初，全局二十个钻探小组还没有一个学习马文志的经验的。有一个矿山提出要大力推广使用长钎子，但是材料科并没有给现场准备下够用的长钎子；根据马文志的先进经验，要预备两套沉淀管轮换使用，以缩短辅助生产时间，但是各矿普遍的没有解决套管的供应问题。也还有这样的情况，例如阜新矿务局有的矿在推广“成品棚子”时，领导干部没做认真研究就下了命令：“限一星期推广，否则就把坑内的支柱工调出来。”结果是棚子规格不对，编组号码不清，棚子送到井下后仍需截锯，失去了“成品棚子”的意义，使“成品棚子”的推广工作流于形式。同时对先进经验的创造者和学习先进经验成绩优良的人，一般说奖励是不够的，这也使先进经验的推广受到一定影响。
    其次，还有一些领导干部，根本忽视推广先进经验，甚至对这项工作抱着对抗情绪。例如有些单位制定增产节约计划时，只提增产节约数字，对推广先进经验则只字不提。有些单位则强调困难，不肯积极进行推广工作。有的领导干部则骄傲自满，不愿学习兄弟厂矿的先进经验，愿意自己另外创造一套“典型经验”。有的人甚至还没有研究别人的先进经验，就自以为是地认为没有什么，不值得推广。存在着这样的领导思想的单位，自然谈不到如何推广先进经验了。
    为了迅速地使先进经验的推广工作成为群众运动，各单位的领导干部必须首先端正自己对这一工作的认识，并发动广大职工学习讨论，制定推广工作的具体措施计划，提出推广的要求，定期进行检查。在推广过程中应该采用先进经验传播班等有效方式，以培养骨干取得经验。
