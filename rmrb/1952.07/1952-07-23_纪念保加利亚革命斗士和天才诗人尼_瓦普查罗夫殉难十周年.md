    Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Nikola Vaptsarov, Bulgarian Revolutionary Fighter and Genius Poet
    Hong Shen
    Editor's note: Today is the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of the Bulgarian revolutionary poet Nikola Yankov Vaptsarov. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is scheduled to hold a memorial meeting in Beijing today. We are publishing two commemorative articles here.
    In 1942, the year the Bulgarian Communist Party mobilized workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals to wage a heroic and arduous struggle against the Nazi occupation forces and the fascist regime within the country, the reactionary rulers of Bulgaria adopted cruel high-pressure policies to curb the upsurge of the nationwide resistance movement. Under their persecution, anti-fascists were arrested everywhere, and many were sentenced to death. Among these patriotic men who dedicated themselves to the freedom of their motherland and the interests of the people, the Bulgarian genius poet Nikola Yankov Vaptsarov was a glorious sacrifice.
    Vaptsarov was born on November 27, 1909, in the city of Bansko. His ancestors had participated in the liberation movement against Turkish enslavement, and his parents both had revolutionary ideas. When he was in middle school, Vaptsarov liked to recite classical masterpieces from Bulgaria, Russia, and other countries. His precocious talent and rich imagination enabled him to create some poems in his childhood. After he entered the industrial vocational school, he obtained the opportunity to recite the classic works of Marx, which made him realize the true meaning of the proletarian revolution. After graduation, he worked as a ship crew member, cook, and worker. During the economic depression, he was unemployed several times. Poverty and hunger caused him to lose his beloved child and also destroyed his health.
    In 1933, Vaptsarov joined the Communist Party of Bulgaria. From then on, his political consciousness developed faster, and his hatred for capitalists and reactionary rulers deepened. In 1940, his poem "Rural Chronicle" was deemed illegal, and the court summoned him for interrogation. In 1941, the newspaper "Literary Review," which he edited to promote revolutionary ideas, was also forced to cease publication. During the period when the German Nazi bandits occupied Bulgaria and attacked the Soviet Union, Vaptsarov participated in the resistance movement, organizing workers, peasants, patriotic soldiers, and progressive intellectuals across the country to fight for Bulgaria's freedom and independence. In the underground organization, he was an active activist and leader. In 1942, he was arrested by the reactionary government and suffered various tortures in prison. On July 23 of the same year, the fascist court announced his death sentence, and the ruthless bullets finally ended the life of this poet who dedicated his beautiful youth and bright red blood to his motherland and people.
    In the development of Bulgarian revolutionary literature, the great poems written by Nikola Vaptsarov mark a new peak stage. Because he was a talented poet from a worker background, his creations expressed the thoughts and hopes of the workers, and expressed his sympathy and love for the workers. His collection of poems "Motor Songs," published in 1940, is a great work reflecting the life and struggle of Bulgarian workers during the fascist rule; his poems also depict the extravagance and shamelessness of the parasitic class in the society at that time, and depict their actions of destroying the happy life of mankind in the darkness of egoism and oppression. In the contrast between the lives of these two different figures, he pointed out that the Bulgarian working people can only strive for their liberation and a happy future from the revolutionary struggle. By bringing his creative genius to bear on such a great theme, Vaptsarov made his own poems not only play a role in publicizing and mobilizing the Bulgarian people's anti-enemy movement, but also become a source of excitement and encouragement for labor construction after the victory of the Bulgarian people's liberation.
    But Vaptsarov's greatness lies not only in his literary achievements, but especially in the greatness of his personality. From the beginning of his social life until the day of his death, he always stood at the forefront of the battle. The noble spirit of patriotism and the spirit of selfless revolutionaries were manifested in his actions at all times, and revealed in his words and verses. He integrated the mission given to him by his party and people, the lofty theories he learned from the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the inspiration he gained from the masterpieces of Gorky and other great Soviet writers, his own dreams and reality, and his belief and optimism in the future into a great purpose—the victory of freedom and justice. During the four months he was imprisoned, he suffered all kinds of inhumane tortures from the fascist thugs. They whipped him unconscious several times, hung him upside down, and burned him with electric current, but Vaptsarov never yielded. He not only showed an unwavering spirit, but also encouraged the courage of the patriotic men who were arrested with him. Even after the death sentence was announced, he was still calm and composed, said his final farewell to his relatives and friends, and wrote his impassioned verses. Such a great personality who calmly faced death and regarded death as home, even if he had not created those poems that shone new light in the field of modern Bulgarian literature, would have been enough to add a glorious and immortal page to the biographies of those who sacrificed gloriously for the revolutionary cause all over the world.
    We know that the Bulgarian people have always been a peace-loving and freedom-loving nation, and are willing to fight and sacrifice for peace and freedom with their lives. From the end of the fourteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century, the Bulgarian people groaned under the iron hooves of Turkey for about five hundred years. But the Bulgarian people have been constantly waging resolute struggles against their enslavers and oppressors. In the battles of armed guerrillas, many moving heroic deeds emerged. In the Second World War, the Bulgarian people further promoted the traditional spirit of their ancestors in the anti-fascist movement to strive for liberation. And the poet Vaptsarov is a great figure representing this movement.
    Vaptsarov gloriously sacrificed himself ten years ago. Today, the violent fascist aggressors have been justly punished in the face of the people's trial. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has been established, and the Bulgarian people are victoriously advancing on the road of socialist development. The important task that the Bulgarian people must accomplish today—and that progressive mankind all over the world must accomplish—is to strive for the victory of peace and democracy. Judging from the enthusiastic sentiment of the Bulgarian people commemorating the tenth anniversary of Vaptsarov's death, we can fully believe that they are preparing to inherit the heroic and courageous spirit of their ancestors and wage an increasingly arduous struggle against the new instigators of war.

    纪念保加利亚革命斗士和天才诗人尼·瓦普查罗夫殉难十周年
    洪深
    编者按：今日为保加利亚革命诗人尼古拉·杨柯夫·瓦普查罗夫殉难的十周年纪念日。中华全国文艺界联合会定于今日在北京举行纪念会。我们在这里发表两篇纪念文章。
    在一九四二年，也就是保加利亚共产党动员了工人、农民和进步知识分子，与国内的纳粹占领军和法西斯政权进行英勇、艰苦斗争的那一年，保加利亚的反动统治者采取了残酷的高压政策来遏止全国性的反抗运动的高潮。在他们的迫害之下，反法西斯分子到处受到逮捕，有许多被判处死刑。在这些为祖国的自由、为人民的利益而献身的爱国志士中，保加利亚的天才诗人尼古拉·扬柯夫·瓦普查罗夫便是一个光荣的牺牲者。
    瓦普查罗夫在一九○九年十一月二十七日生于班斯柯城。他的先人曾经参加过反抗土耳其奴役的解放运动，他的父母都有革命思想。当他在中学上学的时候，瓦普查罗夫就喜欢诵读保加利亚、俄罗斯和其他各国的古典名著。他的早熟的天才和丰富的想像力使他在幼年创作了一些诗篇。他考入工业专门学校以后，获得了诵读马克思经典著作的机会，这使他认识了无产阶级革命的真实意义。毕业后，他做过轮船船员、伙伕和工人。在经济不景气的期间，他曾经几度失业，贫困和饥饿使他失去了他的心爱的孩子，同时也摧毁了他的健康。
    一九三三年，瓦普查罗夫加入了保加利亚的共产党。从那时起，他的政治觉悟发展得更快，对资本家和反动统治者的仇恨变得更深。一九四○年，他的“农村纪事”一首诗被认为违法，法庭传他去受审问。一九四一年，他所主编的宣传革命思想的报纸“文学评论”，也被迫停刊。在德国纳粹暴徒占领保加利亚和进攻苏联的这一段期间，瓦普查罗夫参加反抗运动，组织全国的工人、农民、爱国军队和进步知识分子，为争取保加利亚的自由与独立而斗争。在地下组织中，他是一个积极的活动者和领导者。一九四二年，他被反动政府所逮捕，在狱中受了种种酷刑。同年七月二十三日，法西斯法庭宣布他的死刑，无情的枪弹终于结束了这一位以美丽青春和鲜红热血献给他的祖国和人民的诗人的生命。
    在保加利亚革命文学的发展中，尼古拉·瓦普查罗夫所写的伟大的诗篇，标志着一个登峰造极的新阶段。由于他是一个工人出身的天才的诗人，他的创作表现出工人的思想与希望，表现出他对于工人的同情与敬爱。他在一九四○年出版的那一部诗选集“发动机的歌声”，是一部反映出法西斯统治时期保加利亚工人的生活和斗争的伟大作品；他的诗篇也描绘出当时社会中寄生阶级的荒淫与无耻，描绘出他们在利己和压迫的黑暗中破坏人类美满生活的行动。在这两种不同的人物的生活对照之下，他指出：保加利亚劳动人民只有从革命斗争中争取他们的解放和美满幸福的将来。在这样一个伟大的主题上来发挥他的创作的天才，瓦普查罗夫使他自己的诗篇，不但在保加利亚人民的抗敌运动中起了宣传和鼓动的作用，并在保加利亚人民解放胜利后也成为劳动建设的兴奋鼓舞的泉源。
    但是瓦普查罗夫的伟大处，不只在于他的文学的成就，尤在于他的人格的伟大。从他的社会生活的开始，一直到他遇难的那一天，他始终是站在战斗的最前列。高尚的爱国主义的精神和忘我的革命者的精神，无时不在他的行动上表现出来，在他的言论和诗行中流露出来。他把他的党和人民所付给他的使命、把他从马克思列宁主义经典著作中所领悟到的崇高理论、把他从高尔基和其他苏联伟大作家的名著中所获得的灵感、把他自己的梦想和现实、把他对将来的信念和乐观，融成一个伟大的目的——自由与正义的胜利。在他系狱的四个月内，他受尽法西斯走狗们的惨无人道的刑讯。他们把他好几次鞭打得失去了知觉，把他倒悬起来，并用电流烧他，可是瓦普查罗夫绝不屈服，他不但表现出坚定不移的气概，并鼓起了与他同时被捕的爱国志士的勇气。甚至在死刑宣布以后，他还是镇定自若，向亲友们说出最后的话别，并写成他的慷慨激昂的诗行。像这种从容就义、视死如归的伟大人格，即使他没有创造出那些在保加利亚现代文学领域内放出新的光彩的诗篇，已足使全世界那些为革命事业壮烈牺牲的人物的传记中，添上光辉不朽的一页。
    我们知道：保加利亚人民素来是一个爱好和平与自由的，并愿以生命为争取和平与自由而斗争、而牺牲的民族。从十四世纪末叶到十九世纪末叶，保加利亚人民呻吟于土耳其的铁蹄之下约五百年。可是保加利亚人民不断与他们的奴役者和压迫者进行坚决的斗争。在武装游击队的战斗中，出现了不少可歌可泣的英勇事迹。在第二次世界大战中保加利亚人民在反法西斯运动中更发扬他们先人争取解放的传统精神。而诗人瓦普查罗夫便是代表这一个运动的伟大人物。
    瓦普查罗夫光荣牺牲于十年前。今天，强暴的法西斯侵略者已在人民的审判面前受到应得的惩罚，保加利亚人民共和国已经建立起来，保加利亚人民正向着社会主义发展的道路胜利地迈进。今天保加利亚人民所必须完成的重要任务——也是全世界进步人类所必须完成的任务——就是争取和平与民主的胜利。从保加利亚人民纪念瓦普查罗夫逝世十周年这一种热烈的情绪来看，我们可以充分地相信：他们正准备继承着他们先人的壮烈和英勇精神，与新的战争挑拨者作愈益坚苦的斗争。 （附图片）
