To the Editor: The working style of the CCP Hebei Province Ba County County Committee in promptly investigating and handling problems is worthy of study by various localities, especially county and district leadership.

    A small number of farmers in Fengchan Village, Yangqingkou, Ba County's Third District, wanted to purchase livestock, carts, and fertilizer, but faced difficulties. In order to solve these difficulties, the county people's government allocated 50 million yuan in agricultural loans to the village this year. However, the village government and the CCP village branch did not pay enough attention to the work of issuing these loans, and handed it over to Liu Shaoyuan, the village government's finance committee member, to handle alone. Liu Shaoyuan did not discuss it with everyone, but first loaned himself 1 million yuan, and spent 300,000 yuan of it to marry a wife. He also loaned 600,000 yuan to Jiu Ying, Liu Jiating (a Communist Party member), and Liu Chengzhang three households, and let them use it for other purposes. Most seriously, Guo Suzhen, the deputy village chief and branch committee member, loaned herself 250,000 yuan, and used 130,000 yuan to buy corn for lending at interest, engaging in exploitation. This caused great dissatisfaction among the masses, who demanded that the government deal with this incident.

    After the CCP Ba County County Committee discovered this matter, it immediately sent an inspection team to assist the government in investigating and handling it, and at the same time instructed the CCP Third District Committee to handle this incident within the Party. On May 12th, Li Zhisheng, secretary of the Third District Committee, convened a meeting of all village Party members to criticize this selfish and self-serving thinking. Ning Lun, the village branch secretary, and Zhang Guangdi, the village chief (both Communist Party members), both made self-criticisms, and stated that they "would make up for the prestige of the Party and the government in future work." The branch gave appropriate punishments to the Party members who had made mistakes. The masses were very satisfied with this, and said that the Communist Party is truly selfless, and Communist Party members who make mistakes are dealt with seriously. They said that the work in our village will definitely be done well in the future.

    中共河北省霸县县委
    及时处理问题值得学习
    编辑同志：中共河北省霸县县委及时调查处理问题的工作作风，是值得各地，特别是县、区领导方面学习的。
    霸县三区杨青口丰产村的少数农民，想购买牲畜、大车、肥料，但有困难。为了解决这些困难，县人民政府今年曾拨给该村农业贷款五千万元。可是村政府和中共村支部很不重视发放这笔贷款的工作，把它交给村政府的金融委员刘少元一人去办理。刘少元也不和大家研究，自己先贷了一百万元，娶媳妇就用了三十万元。又贷给咎英、刘家亭（共产党员）和刘程章三户六十万元，也让他们作了别的用处。最严重的是，副村长、支部委员郭素珍一人贷了二十五万元，用十三万元买成玉米放债，进行剥削。这就引起了群众的极大不满，都要求政府处理这一事件。
    中共霸县县委发现这件事情后，立即派出检查组协助政府进行调查处理，同时指示中共三区区委在党内处理这一事件。五月十二日，三区区委书记李志生召集全村党员开会，批判了这种自私自利的思想。村支部书记寗论、村长张广弟（共产党员），都作了检讨，并表示“要在今后工作中来挽回党和政府的威信”。支部对犯错误的党员，给了适当的处分。这样群众都很满意，都说，共产党办事真是大公无私，共产党员犯了错误一样认真处理，以后咱村的工作一定能搞好。
