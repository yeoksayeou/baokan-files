    Lüjiabao Village's "Patriotic Day" Promotes Village Work
    To the Editor: Zhang Defang, a high-yield model from Lüjiabao Village, Feixiang, Hebei Province, who was awarded by the Central Ministry of Agriculture, in order to ensure that the masses are constantly educated in patriotism, to promptly review the patriotic production increase plan, revise the patriotic pledge, and actively mobilize the masses to hold "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day."

    After the heavy rain on July 9th, farmers could not work in the fields. Zhang Defang and other village cadres took advantage of this opportunity to convene the masses of the village and held a "Patriotic Day" ceremony. Gao Yuting, secretary of the CCP village branch, and Gao Quanbi, the village chief, made a review report on the significance of "Patriotic Day," the development of the village's patriotic production increase movement and the cooperative mutual aid movement, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Zhang Defang reported on the current cotton field management, the occurrence of cotton pests, and prevention methods. Village cadre Gao Liancheng once suppressed democracy and had a bad attitude towards the masses. He made a profound self-criticism at this meeting. In the afternoon, all twenty-three mutual aid teams and one production cooperative (accounting for more than 95% of the village's total households and population) held review meetings separately.

    This "Patriotic Day" has advanced the village's patriotic production increase, cooperative mutual aid, and other work. Now, in order to save time in recording work points, all mutual aid teams in the village have uniformly switched to a work ticket system, and the production cooperative has decided to evaluate work every ten days. Each household and each team has revised the patriotic pledge, written it on a sign, and hung it at the door for review on the next "Patriotic Day." The whole village has also revised the patriotic pledge to make it truly a common program for the patriotic actions of the masses of the whole village.

    On this "Patriotic Day," the masses also arranged the central work for the village in the next ten days (handing over public grain, carrying out the "Five Cleans and Five Eliminations" patriotic sanitation campaign, hoeing the cotton fields thoroughly once, completing the topping and side-shoot removal work, and continuing to capture boll weevils, etc.). Now the masses of the whole village are working hard to do these tasks well, and everyone is in high spirits. Wang Zehua

    吕家堡村举行的“爱国日”推动了全村工作
    编辑同志：河北肥乡吕家堡村荣获中央农业部奖励的丰产模范张德芳，为了使群众经常受到爱国主义的教育，及时检查爱国增产计划，修订爱国公约，积极发动群众举行“抗美援朝爱国日”。
    七月九日大雨以后，农民不能下地干活，张德芳和其他村干部利用这个机会，召集全村群众，举行了“爱国日”的大会仪式。中共村支部书记高玉廷、村长高全壁在会上就“爱国日”的意义、本村爱国增产运动和合作互助运动的发展情况和优缺点，作了一个检查报告。张德芳在会上报告了当前的棉田管理、棉虫发生情况和防治办法。村干部高连成有一次压制民主，对群众态度不好，他在这次会上作了深刻的检讨。下午全村二十三个互助组和一个生产合作社（共占全村总户数总人口百分之九十五以上）分别召开了检讨会。
    这个“爱国日”使全村爱国增产、合作互助等工作都向前推进了一步。现在全村互助组为了节省记工时间，一律改成了工票制，生产合作社决定每十天评分一次。各户、各组都重新修订了爱国公约，把它写在牌上，挂在门口，以便在下一个“爱国日”进行检查。全村也重新修订了爱国公约，使它真正成为全村群众爱国行动的共同纲领。
    在这个“爱国日”群众还布置了全村十天内的中心工作（缴公粮、开展“五净五灭”的爱国卫生运动、把棉田普锄一遍、完成整枝打杈工作、继续捕捉象鼻虫等）。现在全村群众正在为做好这些工作而努力，大家情绪非常高。  王则华
