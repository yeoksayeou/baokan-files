    Review of "Twenty Questions and Answers on Agricultural Production Cooperatives" in Shanxi Daily

    The "Twenty Questions and Answers on Agricultural Production Cooperatives" published continuously by Shanxi Daily in mid-May is one of the important ways for newspapers to solve the public's doubts. Based on the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," the Shanxi Daily editorial department collected the public's doubts and asked advanced figures among the masses to answer them. These answers specifically and popularly resolved the public's many doubts about the nature, distribution, system, and development prospects of agricultural production cooperatives, playing a significant role.

    This spring, the Shanxi Daily editorial department received many letters from readers asking about the experience of establishing agricultural production cooperatives and raising many doubts. These doubts can be summarized into the following three aspects: First, regarding the nature and future of agricultural production cooperatives. Some farmers asked: Why establish agricultural production cooperatives when there are mutual aid teams? How much more income will it bring compared to mutual aid teams and individual farmers? Some farmers believed that agricultural production cooperatives were to implement "communism" and "eat from the big pot"; some others did not believe in "cooperation," thinking that "even close brothers have to divide the family property, how can one or two dozen households cooperate in farming?" and so on. Second, regarding distribution issues. Some farmers asked: How will dividends be distributed after land and labor are contributed as shares? How will the cooperative's agricultural and sideline products be distributed? Will households with less labor and more land, or more labor and less land, be at a disadvantage? How will investments in livestock, farm tools, and fertilizers be calculated? Some doubted that distribution would be difficult, thinking that "it is easy to farm in agricultural cooperatives, but difficult to divide grain," and so on. Third, regarding system issues. Some farmers asked: How to handle land that is cultivated on behalf of others and used as a share? What if a member is sick and misses a lot of work? What are the conditions for members to join and withdraw from the cooperative? Some were afraid of "not being free and unrestrained after joining the cooperative," and so on. To effectively solve these many doubts, not only theoretical and policy knowledge is needed, but also practical experience. The Shanxi Daily editorial department invited Wang Jinyun (director of the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang) and Yang Xicheng (director of the Xiguxian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tunliu County), provincial model workers who came to Taiyuan to participate in the People's Representative Conference, to answer these doubts in detail. After the editorial department sorted and summarized them, they became the "Twenty Questions and Answers on Agricultural Production Cooperatives."

    This "Questions and Answers" is a collective work of farmers, model workers, and the Shanxi Daily editorial department, and a product of the combination of theory, policy, and practical experience. It vividly publicized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives in an easy-to-understand form. For example, when answering why agricultural production cooperatives should be established, Yang Xicheng said: "Mutual aid teams only have 'unity', and members often think more about personal gain; agricultural cooperatives have a 'collective nature', and members always think about the interests of the entire cooperative; in this way, production can be greatly improved." For example, when answering the principle of land and labor share dividends, Wang Jinyun said: "We adopted the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic approval by the members' congress for land and labor shareholding." Regarding the system, Yang Xicheng replied that there is a fundamental system stipulated in the cooperative's charter, which is "cooperative first, family second," and "give priority to cooperative land, then do your own private land." Regarding the issue of members asking for leave for personal matters, Wang Jinyun replied that they are planning to use
    the method of "having a Sunday" to solve the problem of members' free time.

    These simple and concise answers deeply touched people's hearts and solved many doubts about agricultural production cooperatives among cadres and the masses in the province. According to recent letters from readers of the Shanxi Daily, everyone believes that these questions and answers are very helpful in solving problems. Zhao Jigan, a single farmer in Beiyangyuan, Ruicheng County, said after reading this Q&A: "Agricultural cooperatives are good, I used to think they were communism! Now I know that they are neither communism nor stronger than mutual aid teams. I am determined not to farm on my own." Liu Yucheng said: "I want to run our mutual aid team well and gradually develop it into an agricultural production cooperative." Chen Yanmin, a worker at the Linfen Station Locomotive Section of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, also wrote: "From the Q&A, I not only saw the benefits of cooperation and mutual assistance, but especially saw how the peasant brothers in the new society, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are also embarking on the road of collective production. ...It encouraged my confidence in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance." The Propaganda Department of the Qinyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to organize all the party and youth league branches and 1,142 mutual aid teams in the county to seize the slack season and study this "Q&A." These facts illustrate the great role of this "Q&A" and show that this way of solving the public's doubts is worth promoting.

    Recently, Shanxi Daily used this method again to answer the question raised by the masses of farmers, "Why should we organize?" They sent reporters to Yanjia Village (national high-yield model village) in Jie County to ask Shao Shuanghe, a national high-yield model worker, and Shi Caigui, a model worker in Yuncheng, to answer, and compiled them into "Fifty Questions and Answers on Mutual Aid Teams," which began to be published continuously in the newspaper on June 5.

    The experience of Shanxi Daily is a creative method for newspapers to connect with the masses and connect with reality, and newspapers in various places should pay attention to it.

### 评山西日报“农业生产合作社问答二十条”

    评山西日报“农业生产合作社问答二十条”
    山西日报五月中旬连续发表的“农业生产合作社问答二十条”，是报纸解决群众疑难的重要方式方法之一。山西日报编辑部根据“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则，集中了群众的疑难，请群众中先进人物加以解答。这些解答具体地通俗地解决了群众对农业生产合作社的性质、分配、制度以及发展前途的许多疑难，发挥了极大的作用。
    山西日报编辑部今年春天收到许多读者来信，询问建立农业生产合作社的经验，并提出了不少疑难。这些疑难可概括成如下三个方面：第一是关于农业生产合作社的性质和前途。有些农民问：有了互助组，为啥又要成立农业生产合作社？它的收入比互助组和单干户多多少？有些农民认为农业生产合作社是要实行“共产”、“吃大锅饭”；也有些人不相信能搞好“合作”，认为“亲兄弟还要分家哩，一二十户合伙养种，那能合得来？”等等。第二是关于分配问题。有些农民问：土地、劳力入股后怎样分红？社里的农副业怎样分红？劳力少土地多或劳力多土地少的户是否吃亏？牲口、农具、肥料等投资又怎样计算？有的怀疑不好分配，认为“农业社养种好办，分粮难”等等。第三是关于制度问题。有些农民问：代耕土地入股怎么办？社员病了误工多怎么办？社员入社退社有什么条件？有的则怕“入了社不自由，不随便”等等。要有效地解决这许多疑难，不但需要理论和政策知识，而且需要实际经验。山西日报编辑部请了到太原来参加人民代表会议的省劳动模范王锦云（武乡窑上沟农业生产合作社社长）和杨喜成（屯留县西故县农业生产合作社社长）详细地解答这些疑难，经编辑部整理归纳，便成了“农业生产合作社问答二十条”。
    这个“问答”是农民、劳动模范和山西日报编辑部的集体著作，是理论、政策和实际经验相结合的产物。它通过生动活泼的形式，通俗地宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性。例如杨喜成在回答为啥要成立生产合作社时说：“互助组只是个‘团结性’，组员还常是为个人打算的多；农业社是个‘集体性’，社员总是为全社打算；这样，就能大大提高生产。”又如王锦云在回答土地劳力入股分红的原则时说：“土地和劳力入股，我们都采用了自报公议、社员大会民主通过的办法。”在制度方面，杨喜成回答说：社章上规定有一条根本制度，是“先社后家”，“先尽社地，后做自流地”。关于社员有事外出请假问题，王锦云回答说，他们正计划用
    “过星期日”的办法，解决社员自由活动时间的问题。
    这样简单扼要的解答，深深打动了人心，解决了全省干部群众对农业生产合作社的许多疑难。仅据山西日报最近读者来信反映，大家都认为这个问答很解决问题。芮城县北阳院农民赵纪纲是一个单干户，他读了这个问答后说：“农业社就是好，我原先当成是共产哩！现在才知道它既不是共产，也比互助组强。我坚决不单干了。”刘玉成说：“我要把我们的互助组搞好，慢慢发展成农业生产合作社。”太原铁路分局临汾站机务段工人陈彦民也来信说：“从问答里，不光看到了合作互助的好处，特别使我看到新社会的农民弟兄，如何在毛主席的领导之下，也走向集体生产的道路。……鼓舞了我对巩固工农联盟的信心。”中共沁源县委宣传部决定组织全县党、团支部和一千一百四十二个互助组，抓紧农忙空隙学习这个“问答”。这些事实说明了这个“问答”的巨大作用，说明了这样解决群众疑难的方式方法是值得推广的。
    山西日报最近又运用这一方法，解答农民群众所提出的“到底为啥要组织起来”的问题。他们派记者到解县阎家村（全国丰产模范村）请全国丰产模范邵双合和运城劳动模范史采贵解答，并把它们整理为“互助组问答五十条”，从六月五日开始在报上连续发表。
    山西日报的这一经验，是报纸联系群众、联系实际的一个具有创造性的方法，各地报纸应该加以重视。
