    Requesting the Early Promotion of Accelerated Literacy Methods in Factories

    Comrade Editor: I haven't been to school and can't even write a letter, not to mention the difficulties at work. I have heard that accelerated literacy methods are being promoted in various places, and I hope they can be promoted in factories soon. All my worker brothers in the factory have this request.

    要求早些到工厂推广速成识字法
    编辑同志：我没念过书，连写封信都不会写，工作上的困难不用谈了。我听说各地正在推广速成识字法，我希望能早些到工厂里来推广。我厂全体工人兄弟都有这样的要求。
