Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: In order to facilitate import and export trade, the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, after reporting to and obtaining approval from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, issued instructions on July 18th, announcing that in addition to the existing periodic payment method for vessel tonnage tax, a non-periodic payment method would be added, allowing taxpayers to choose and declare payment themselves. The added non-periodic payment method involves levying tax on each voyage (any voyage from a foreign country to one or more ports in our country and then back to a foreign country is considered one voyage), with the tax rate being half of the current periodic payment method; the Customs also stipulates that the tonnage tax license is valid for 30 days from the date of import declaration, regardless of whether the vessel continues to other ports in our country.

    海关总署增订船舶吨税交纳法
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府海关总署为便利进出口贸易，经报奉中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会核准，在七月十八日发出指示，宣布将船舶吨税除现行定期交纳办法外，增订不定期交纳办法一种，由纳税人自行选择报缴。增订的不定期交纳办法，系按每一航次（凡由国外驶达我国一个或几个港口再驶往国外者为一航次）征收一次，税率照现行定期交纳办法减半征收；海关并规定船舶在申报进口日起三十天内，不论是否续航我国其他口岸，吨税执照均属有效。
