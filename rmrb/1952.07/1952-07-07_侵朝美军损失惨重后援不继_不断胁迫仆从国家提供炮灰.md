Xinhua News Agency, June 6th:

The American aggressors in Korea, suffering heavy losses under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese People's forces and facing dwindling support, are constantly extorting cannon fodder from their vassal states in an attempt to continue the war of aggression against Korea.

According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 4th, "U.S. officials say the United States has called on other United Nations member states to increase troops in Korea." "Officials say the call for reinforcements has been sent to countries that have already sent troops to Korea and those that have not." However, the demands of the American aggressors have not been met. U.S. officials admitted that the "response" from U.S. vassal states to the troop increase "call" was "minimal." So-called "well-informed sources" said that despite the measures taken by the United States, "other countries have not increased their forces by much in the last six months."

To this end, the American aggressors are putting pressure on their vassal states in an attempt to get them to provide more troops to continue making futile sacrifices in the Korean War for the benefit of the American aggressors. According to a broadcast by Australian Radio on the 4th: "Truman told the US Congress that the United States is continuing to pressure its allies to provide more troops in Korea."

    侵朝美军损失惨重后援不继　不断胁迫仆从国家提供炮灰
    【新华社六日讯】在朝中人民部队沉重打击下损失惨重、后援不继的美国侵略者，正向它的仆从国家不断勒索炮灰，以图继续进行侵略朝鲜的战争。
    据合众社华盛顿四日电透露：“美国官员说：美国曾号召其他联合国会员国增兵朝鲜。”“官员们说：要求增兵的呼吁已送交已经出兵朝鲜的国家以及尚未出兵的国家。”但是，美国侵略者的要求并不如意。美国官员承认，美国的仆从国家对于增兵“号召”，“响应者很少”。所谓“消息灵通人士”说，尽管美国采取了上述措施，“在最近六个月内其他国家并没有增加多大兵力”。
    为此，美国侵略者正对其仆从国家施行压力，企图使之提供更多的军队，为美国侵略者的利益继续在侵朝战争中作无谓的牺牲。据澳洲电台四日广播：“杜鲁门对美国国会说，美国正继续压使盟国在朝鲜提供较多的部队。”
