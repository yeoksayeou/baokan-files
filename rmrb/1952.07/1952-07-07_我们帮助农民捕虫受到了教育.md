    We Were Educated by Helping Farmers Catch Insects

    Comrade Editor: In early and late May, our school's students spent a portion of their afternoon recreational activities time (eight days in total) going to the countryside to eradicate field pests. We captured more than 800,000 moths, rice leaf rollers, and other pests. We ourselves were educated in this work, and it also inspired the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses.

    We originally did not know how field pests harmed crops, but now we do, and we also know how to eliminate them. We applied all the pest-catching methods we learned in textbooks to practice, and we also came up with some pest-catching methods of our own. We not only caught pests ourselves, but also mobilized the peasant masses to catch them together. Once, we showed the captured insects to the farmers, and they were all shocked. Many farmers who were working in the fields came to join the pest-catching effort. We mobilized more than 120 farmers to catch pests at once. The head of Dawu Township said to us, "You are really good. Students helping farmers eliminate pests is something that has never happened before." An elderly Mr. Li from Xintang Township, who is over seventy years old, said, "In the past, our seedlings were eaten up by insects, and the reactionary government didn't care, and the landlords still demanded rent as usual. Now, as soon as the insects appear, even the school teachers and students come to help us catch them. We must do a good job in production to be worthy of Chairman Mao!" The mother of a volunteer soldier expressed to us that she must tell her son about this situation, and ask her son to kill more enemies on the front lines.

    我们帮助农民捕虫受到了教育
    编辑同志：五月上旬和下旬，我们学校的同学每天抽出下午一段文娱活动时间（共八天），下乡去扑灭田间害虫。我们共计捕捉螟蛾、稻苞虫等各种害虫八十万只以上。我们自己在这件工作中受到了教育，同时也鼓舞了农民群众生产情绪。
    我们原先不知道田间害虫怎样害庄稼，现在知道了，而且还知道怎样去消灭它。我们把课本上学到的一些捕虫方法全用到实际中去了，而且还想出了一些捕虫方法。我们不只是自己捕打，还发动农民群众一起捕打。有一次，我们把捕捉到的虫子给农民看，他们看了都吃一惊。有许多正在田间耕作的农民都来参加捕虫。我们一次就发动了一百二十多个农民捕虫。大屋乡乡长对我们说：“你们真好。学生帮助农民消灭虫害，这是从来没有的事。”新塘乡一位七十多岁的姓李的老人说：“从前我们的禾苗被虫吃光，反动政府也不理会，地主还照样要租子。现在虫一起，连学校的老师、学生都来帮我们捉虫。我们一定要搞好生产，才能对得住毛主席！”有一个志愿军战士的母亲向我们表示，一定要把这种情形告诉她的儿子，要她儿子在前方多杀敌人。
