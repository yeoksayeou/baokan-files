Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 13th: The American generals who are always loudly proclaiming “humanitarianism” towards prisoners of war have added the dripping blood of their own captured personnel to their hands. On the 11th of this month, they sent planes to indiscriminately bomb our No. 9 prisoner-of-war camp. One hundred and ten American prisoners of war who, according to our proposals for resolving the issue of prisoners of war, could have immediately returned to their homes, were either killed or wounded by the bombing. This brutal incident demonstrates that the U.S. government, in order to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression, does not hesitate to massacre their own captured personnel on a large scale.

Observers here familiar with the prisoner-of-war issue pointed out: The incident on the 11th was not only a deliberate action by the U.S. side, but also a long-planned one. All our prisoner-of-war camps are clearly marked in accordance with the agreements between the two sides. However, in the past month, the chief U.S. representative, Harrison, deliberately repeatedly raised the issue of the markings of our No. 9 and several other prisoner-of-war camps. On July 1st, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out in a letter to Harrison: "Your side, disregarding the facts, has repeatedly raised the so-called issue of the location and markings of our prisoner-of-war camps, obviously seeking an excuse to create new incidents." Ten days later, U.S. planes indeed indiscriminately bombed the No. 9 prisoner-of-war camp near Pyongyang. From this fact, it is clear that the U.S. side is attempting to manufacture excuses in advance to evade its responsibility for deliberately massacring its own captured personnel.

Secondly, observers here pointed out: The U.S. side's actions of massacring their own captured personnel are consistent. On January 14th of this year, U.S. planes bombed our Jiangdong prisoner-of-war camp, killing or wounding 79 prisoners of war; on March 16th, U.S. planes strafed the Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp, wounding one British prisoner of war; on May 4th and 5th, U.S. planes bombed and strafed the Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp again; on May 11th, U.S. planes strafed the Jiangdong prisoner-of-war camp for the second time, seriously wounding four prisoners of war. The U.S. side has not provided a responsible explanation or handling of these incidents. The indiscriminate bombing on the 11th was even more malicious than in the past.

The observer concluded: Two days before this incident, on July 9th, the U.S. side killed or wounded more than 20 of our captured personnel in Nonsan, South Korea. This series of serious provocative incidents occurred precisely during the period when the Korean armistice negotiations, due to our side's renewed major efforts, had entered an administrative meeting to seek a solution to the prisoner-of-war issue that could meet the requirements of both sides. The U.S. side's actions are clearly intended to delay the negotiations, or even sabotage the negotiations, in order to expand the war of aggression. Peace-loving people all over the world should be doubly vigilant about this.

    开城观察家评美方狂炸我战俘营的暴行
    【新华社开城十三日电】满嘴高唱对战俘“人道主义”的美国将军们，手上又增添了他们自己被俘人员的淋漓鲜血。本月十一日，他们派遣飞机狂炸我方第九号战俘营。按照我方解决战俘问题的建议本可立即重返家园的一百一十名美方战俘，被炸死或炸伤。这一次残酷事件，说明了美国政府为了破坏停战谈判，扩大侵略战争，甚至于不惜大规模杀害他们自己的被俘人员。
    此间熟悉战俘问题的观察家指出：十一日的事件，不但是美方蓄意的行动，而且这行动是布置已久的。我方各战俘营都按双方协议设有明显标志。但上个月内，美方首席代表哈利逊却故意一再提出我方第九及其他几个战俘营的标志问题。本月一日，我方首席代表南日将军在致哈利逊的一封复信中即已指出：“你方不顾事实，一再提出所谓我方战俘营的位置与标识问题，显系为制造新的事件找寻藉口。”十天之后，美机果然滥炸平壤近郊的第九号战俘营。从这件事实看来，美方企图预先制造藉口以逃避其由于有意屠杀自己被俘人员而应负的责任，已经是一目了然了。
    其次，此间观察家指出：美方这种屠杀他们自己被俘人员的事件是一贯的。今年一月十四日，美机轰炸我方江东战俘营，死伤战俘七十九名；三月十六日，美机扫射昌城战俘营，伤英籍战俘一名；五月四日、五日，美机再度轰炸扫射昌城战俘营；五月十一日，美机第二次扫射江东战俘营，重伤战俘四名。对这些事件，美方都没有做过负责的交代和处理。十一日的滥炸，却比过去更为恶毒。
    观察家最后称：在此事件发生前两天，即七月九日，美方曾在南朝鲜论山杀伤我方被俘人员二十余人。这一连串严重挑衅事件，正发生在朝鲜停战谈判因我方再度重大努力而进入行政性会议、觅求可以符合双方要求的有关战俘问题解决方案的时期。美方这种行动，显然是意图拖延谈判，甚至破坏谈判，以便扩大侵略战争。全世界爱好和平的人民对此应该加倍警惕。
