Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: The German Communist Party and the French Communist Party sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, congratulating them on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. The German Communist Party's congratulatory telegram stated: American plans, like the deployment in Japan in East Asia, aim to transform Germany into America's main base for war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Ridgway has been transferred from Korea to Europe, where he will utilize the experience gained in Korea. The congratulatory telegram emphasized: However, the German people do not want their country to become a second Korea. In the struggle to conclude a peace treaty that is of great importance to the interests of the German people, in the struggle for German unification and national independence, in the struggle for the full sovereignty of an all-German government, and in the struggle against the ratification of enslaving treaties, the people of West Germany regard the struggle of the Japanese people under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party as a shining example. We wish the Japanese Communist Party and its Central Committee, under the leadership of Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda, every success in guiding the Japanese people's struggle for liberation.
The French Communist Party Central Committee's congratulatory telegram stated: The struggle of the French and Japanese peoples is against the same enemies of national independence, the same supporters of fascism, and the same warmongers. The demonstrations of the Japanese people in defense of peace, democratic rights, and national independence are receiving the most concerned attention from all democrats and peace advocates around the world. These demonstrations, as well as the powerful protest movements in various countries around the world, contribute to the strengthening of the forces of peace and freedom in France, because Duclos was therefore released—this is one of the initial victories of the forces of peace and freedom over the warmongers, over the organizers of the heinous anti-communist conspiracies. The demonstrations of the Japanese people have inspired the French people's struggle to demand the release of imprisoned patriots—victims of the American-style fascist repression carried out by the French rulers.

    德共和法共致电祝贺日共建党三十周年
    【新华社十七日讯】德国共产党和法国共产党分别致电日本共产党中央委员会，祝贺日本共产党建党三十周年。德国共产党的贺电说：美国计划，像布置东亚的日本一样，把德国变成美国对苏联和人民民主国家作战的主要基地。李奇微被从朝鲜派到欧洲，他将在这里利用在朝鲜得到的经验。贺电强调指出：但是，德国人民不愿让他们的祖国变成第二个朝鲜。在争取缔结与德国人民的利益有重大关系的和约的斗争中，在争取德国统一和民族独立的斗争中，在争取全德政府的充分主权的斗争中，在反对批准奴役性的条约的斗争中，西德人民把日本人民在其光荣的共产党领导下的斗争，看作他们光辉的榜样。我们祝日本共产党及其中央委员会在德田球一同志的领导下，在指导日本人民解放斗争中取得一切胜利。
    法国共产党中央委员会的贺电说：法国和日本两国人民的斗争，是反对相同的民族独立的敌人，相同的法西斯主义的支持者和战争贩子。日本人民保卫和平、保卫民主权利和民族独立的示威，受到全世界一切民主分子与和平拥护者的最关切的注意。这些示威以及全世界各国的强大抗议运动有助于法国的和平自由力量的加强，因为杜克洛因此获得了释放——这是和平与自由的力量战胜战争贩子、战胜万恶的反共阴谋组织者的最初的胜利之一。日本人民的示威鼓舞了法国人民要求释放被囚的爱国者——法国统治者所进行的美国式法西斯镇压的受难者——的斗争。
