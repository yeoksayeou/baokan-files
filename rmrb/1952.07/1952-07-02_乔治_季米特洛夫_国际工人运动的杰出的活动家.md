Georgi Dimitrov - An Outstanding Activist of the International Workers' Movement
Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Member Avramova
Editor's Note: June 18th marks the 70th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Dimitrov, an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, and today is the third anniversary of his death. We are publishing here commemorative articles by Avramova, a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Bulgarian writer V. Georgiev.

Georgi Dimitrov, the leader and mentor of the Bulgarian people, an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, and a talented student and comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, has reached his seventieth birthday since his birth, and it has been three years since his death. Dimitrov was the son of the Bulgarian working class. In the past fifty years, no major event in the life of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian workers' movement has not been associated with the name and leadership activities of Comrade Dimitrov.

Dimitrov's name is close and dear to every Bulgarian patriot. Dimitrov was an ardent revolutionary and a model Leninist-Communist, who dedicated most of the beautiful part of his life to the international workers' movement.

As stated in the obituary issued by the leaders of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Georgi Dimitrov has won the love of the working people all over the world for his selfless struggle in the ranks of the workers' movement, and for his infinite loyalty to the great doctrine of Lenin-Stalin."

Comrade Dimitrov was a proletarian revolutionary and leader who grew up in the ranks of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party. He experienced the rare happiness of working for many years alongside and under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. He finally formed a true Leninist-Stalinist type of leader.

After the failure of the anti-fascist uprising in 1923, Comrade Dimitrov was forced to live abroad, but he did not stop leading the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian working people in their struggle against fascism and capitalism. Comrade Dimitrov transferred his activities and his ardent revolutionary power to the vast stage of the international workers' movement.

In the international workers' movement, Comrade Dimitrov's name is linked to the struggle of the working class and the working people against fascism and against predatory imperialist wars. His name is a symbol of the anti-fascist struggle and the anti-war struggle.

Dimitrov's heroic struggle in the face of the Leipzig fascist court is immortal in the history of the international workers' movement. In that den of fascist beasts, he not only completely shattered the fabricated accusations made to persecute him, but also brilliantly expressed his communist beliefs, pointed out the historical role of the working class and the inevitable demise of the executioners.

In the face of the court, Dimitrov, with his heroic actions, told revolutionaries all over the world how to fight when a communist fell into the hands of the class enemy. His actions in the Leipzig court were, and still are, a model for freedom fighters in the capitalist world to emulate.

In his fiery speech in front of the Leipzig court with shackles, Dimitrov was seething with his infinite love for the Communist International and the great Soviet Union.

"Yes, I am a Bolshevik, I am a proletarian revolutionary... I am indeed an ardent supporter and admirer of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union... because this party is managing the largest country in the world, occupying one-sixth of the earth, and this party, headed by the great leader Stalin, is bravely and successfully building socialism."

In front of all progressive humanity praising his unparalleled courageous acts, he said these words to the frenzied Goering, fascist judges, and police.

During the Leipzig trial, Comrade Dimitrov, the impeccable internationalist and the ardent fighter for friendship among all ethnic groups, also provided a vivid example of loving the motherland. He proudly defended the dignity of the Bulgarian nation and the revolutionary traditions of the Bulgarian people, which no one defended at that time, from the enemy's attack.

"The Bulgarian people fought extremely tenaciously against foreign oppression with all their strength. Therefore, I protest against the slander of the Bulgarian people. There is no reason to be ashamed of being a Bulgarian. I am proud to be the son of the Bulgarian working class."

His example of pure and ardent patriotism aroused the joy of the working people all over the world and mobilized them to participate in the struggle against the reactionary bourgeoisie and the traitorous, anti-people policies of its lackeys—the right-wing social democrats. First of all, this greatly helped the Bulgarian communists to unite the Bulgarian patriots under their leadership to defend the national independence of the country.

Dimitrov's victory in the Leipzig trial told the workers and working people all over the world that fascism was not as terrible as they wanted to show it; and it showed that as long as the anti-fascist people's forces united against it, it could be defeated. The more important value of Dimitrov's victory in Leipzig lies in the fact that this victory was achieved after the German fascists seized power. This victory gave the people who were striving to overthrow the fascist dictatorship that had been established in many places confidence and strength, and also repelled the fascist offensive. The mass movement to defend Dimitrov and the victory of forcing the fascist court to release Dimitrov proved the power of united struggle. The working class could not but come to the conclusion that unity is the guarantee of victory in the struggle. In particular, social democratic workers could not clearly see that only if they formed a united front with the communists could they succeed. As the General Secretary of the Communist International, Comrade Dimitrov, during the period after the Leipzig trial, developed his activities on this basis, on the basis of the broad unity of the working class and the working people in the cities and the countryside.

The Bulgarian people were among the first to personally experience fascist tyranny. On June 9, 1923, the reactionaries united around the monarch used a coup to establish a fascist dictatorship in the country. A reckless massacre of democratic forces occurred. The anger of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals was irrepressible. The imperative duty of the Bulgarian Communist Party was to rise up and lead the struggle of the working people. As a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, Comrade Dimitrov believed that only by uniting the working people into a united anti-fascist front could they achieve success in the struggle.

Comrade Dimitrov wrote in 1929:

"Without a united workers' front, without the concerted action of all proletarians and working people in urban and rural areas against capitalism, it is impossible to defeat the capitalists' fierce offensive, eradicate the barbaric fascists, prevent new imperialist wars, and, finally, the victory of the liberation of the proletariat revolution."

Later, in 1935, in his report at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, Comrade Dimitrov, using the rich experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and according to the instructions of Comrade Stalin, brilliantly formulated the tactics of the People's Front and determined the general line of the Communist Party in the struggle against the fascist offensive.

The question of what methods could be used to prevent fascism and defeat fascism in this or that country once excited millions of workers and working people all over the world. Comrade Dimitrov explained it very clearly, and pointed out that the road of fascism could be stopped, and at the same time, this matter depended on the workers, peasants, and all the working people themselves.

Through the struggle against the heads of the fascist governments and the reactionary heads of the reform organizations, he appealed to the workers and working people all over the world, calling on them to unite their forces in the international anti-fascist front to oppose fascism and reactionaries, oppose imperialism's rule in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the increasingly approaching war crisis.

Comrade Dimitrov proved that fascism is not a powerful sign of capitalism, but a sign of capitalism's weakness; although fascism is brutal, it is an unstable regime. He called on the masses to participate in the heroic united struggle against anti-fascism and its military aggression.

The struggle for the unity of the working class—the struggle to establish a unified front of the proletariat—is the basis of the People's Front struggle. Comrade Dimitrov said in his report: "The first thing that should be done is to establish a united front of the working class."

Dimitrov instructed that the vanguard role of the Communist Party in the united and people's front requires strengthening the party's ideology and organization, and requires the party's cadres to have higher principles. When Comrade Dimitrov served as the General Secretary of the Communist International, he did a great deal of organizational and political work in preparing the Communist Parties of various countries to complete the tasks put forward by the Seventh Congress of the Communist International. He believed that the primary task of the Communist Parties of all countries—without completing this task, they could not realize their vanguard role—was to quickly Bolshevize on the basis of the world-historical experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Comrade Dimitrov not only led the Bulgarian Communist Party to Bolshevization, but also helped the Communist Parties of many countries to engage in the struggle to get rid of non-Bolshevik remnants. Comrade Dimitrov was also very concerned about the cause of establishing and cultivating strong Bolshevik cadres for the Communist Parties of various countries. This is one of his great contributions to the international workers' movement. As stated in the obituary issued by the leaders of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for the death of Comrade Dimitrov:

"Comrade Dimitrov has done a great deal of work in the ranks of the international communist movement in teaching the leading cadres of the communist parties of various countries loyalty to the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and loyalty to the cause of defending the interests of the masses of their own people."

Comrade Dimitrov believed that constantly studying the great doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin was urgently needed by the Communist Parties of various countries and their cadres. He himself constantly studied and demanded that others insist on constant study.

"For the Communist Parties of various countries, for the fighting vanguard of the working class, it is as necessary as bread, air, and water to constantly study and understand Marxism-Leninism, the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The attitude of despising theory and the tendency to empiricism must be ended as soon as possible."

"Comrades, we must study, wherever we are, in the process of struggle, in freedom and in prison, we must continue to study."

Comrade Dimitrov emphasized that the cadres of the Communist Party must not only study Marxism-Leninism, but also learn to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism. Every action of his, in every speech, gave us an example of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism, and gave us an example of a Leninist-Stalinist type of leader. Comrade Dimitrov believed that the Communist Parties of various countries should learn from the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), first and foremost from Comrade Stalin, to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism:

"The entire experience of the international communist movement proves this truth: whoever is not a true Leninist cannot be a true Marxist, and whoever is not a true Stalinist cannot be a true Leninist." At the same time, Comrade Dimitrov also pointed out the only correct road to be trained into Bolshevik cadres—the road of selfless struggle.

Comrade Dimitrov wrote:

"In the Bolshevik struggle, unwavering and infinite loyalty to the cause of the working class is worthy of the glorious title of Leninist-Stalinist."

It must be emphasized that Comrade Dimitrov has made extraordinary contributions in popularizing the leading role of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in the international communist movement and consolidating the friendship of all ethnic groups and the great Soviet Union—the guarantee of their freedom and independence. He called on the Communist Parties of various countries to unite around the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and to work for the unity of the world proletariat around the Soviet working class. He believed that it was absolutely necessary for the Communist Parties of various countries to unite around the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) into a unified communist movement. He believed that this movement could promote the consistency of the policies and goals of the Communist Parties of various countries, and could make the actions of the Communist Parties of various countries follow a theory—the great doctrines of Lenin and Stalin.

Comrade Dimitrov exposed the reactionary leaders of socialist parties and trade unions, who "are flesh and blood with the ruling classes of their own countries, and they are equally afraid of the victory of the working class, and they are consistent with the bourgeoisie on all basic issues of international and domestic policies." They helped fascists and war mongers by acting against the Soviet Union. Dimitrov said:

"The touchstone for checking whether every activist of the workers' movement, every workers' party and workers' organization, and every democrat in capitalist countries is loyal and sincere is their attitude towards the great socialist country." At the same time, he said, "At the historical watershed between the forces of fascism, war, and capitalism and the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, in fact, it is the attitude towards the Soviet Union, not the general superficial attitude towards the Soviet regime and socialism, but towards the Soviet Union, which has actually existed for twenty years and its continuous struggle against enemies, its dictatorship of the working class, the Stalin Constitution, and the leading role of the Lenin-Stalin Party."

Comrade Dimitrov hated bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism very much, and waged a relentless struggle against their manifestations in the workers' movement. He said that without the continuous struggle against bourgeois ideology and its conductors in the workers' movement—the right-wing social democrats—without the struggle against bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism—the manifestations of bourgeois ideology—there can be no truly Marxist-Leninist education for communists, and there can be no success in the work of the communist movement.

The events after the Seventh Congress of the Communist International proved the correctness of the policies given to the Communist Parties of various countries. The strategy of the People's Front was fully proven to be justified. The correctness of this policy was particularly evident during the Second World War, when in the countries occupied by the Hitler bandit gang, millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals united into a powerful People's Front under the leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries, and rose up to engage in a brave struggle to defend their country's freedom and independence. Through the front, through the fascist sentry lines and fortresses, the people combined their struggle with the struggle of the glorious Soviet army, and with the struggle of the great Soviet people into a general, indivisible and unshakable world front against fascism, against reactionary forces, and war.

In many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, workers, peasants, and all other working people formed the People's Front under the leadership of the Communist Party. At the same time, relying on the historical victory of the Soviet army in the Second World War, they established the people's democratic regime. The heroic struggle of the great Chinese people for many years has also achieved victory. This victory, as Comrade Dimitrov said, is one of the major factors that disrupted and overturned the plans of the megalomaniacal American imperialists.

What Comrade Dimitrov said at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International and studied in many subsequent papers has gained greater strength today. His assessment of German fascism is this:

"This is not only bourgeois nationalism, this is bestial chauvinism, this is a regime of robber politics, this is a system of instigation and torture against the working class and revolutionary peasants, petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals. This is medieval barbarism and brutality. This is unscrupulous aggression against other peoples and countries. German fascism is the vanguard of international counter-revolution, the main instigator of imperialist wars, and the instigator of a crusade against the Soviet Union—the great motherland of the working people all over the world."

These assessments are fully applicable to the Anglo-American imperialists and their barbaric moral theories who are frenziedly preparing for the Third World War, and to their inhuman destructive war in Korea, and to their rude hatred of the people, especially the fortress of peace—the great Soviet Union.

The powerful world movement for peace uniting hundreds of millions of people all over the world is developing on a much broader basis, under new conditions created after the Second World War, and under the guidance of the tactics of the People's Front that has grown into a powerful united world anti-imperialist peace front headed by the Soviet Union. Today, most ordinary people around the world understand that if the imperialist reactionaries are not stopped, it will be impossible to defend the freedom and independence of the people, it will be impossible to defend democracy and eliminate the danger of a third world war. At the same time, it is they themselves who can complete this prevention—millions of people united into a powerful world movement for peace. Comrade Stalin said: "If the peoples of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated." This sentence gives people confidence and strength in the struggle to defend peace. The friendship between the peoples of all countries is becoming stronger day by day, and their will to victory is becoming stronger.

After the liberation of Bulgaria from the occupation of Hitler and fascist oppression, Comrade Dimitrov returned to his motherland and led the establishment of a people's democratic country. Comrade Dimitrov's great contribution is that he theoretically synthesized the materials concerning the nature, tasks, and future of the Bulgarian people's democratic system. Starting from the instructions of Comrade Stalin and following these instructions, relying on his profound theoretical preparation and rich revolutionary experience, he solved the problems that arose under the new conditions when establishing a people's democratic country—a new form of proletarian dictatorship.

The Fatherland Front, which was established ten years ago by Dimitrov's initiation and leadership, is today the most mass organization of the Bulgarian people and a powerful pillar of the people's regime. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, headed by Comrade Chervenkov, the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, a true and faithful student and successor of Dimitrov's cause, the Bulgarian people are enthusiastically completing the work of building the socialist foundation of the motherland. Thanks to the great, comprehensive, fraternal help of the great Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin himself, the first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan will be completed in four years this year.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the working people of Bulgaria sacredly maintain the tradition of internationalism left to us by Comrade Dimitrov. Today, the People's Republic of Bulgaria firmly stands on the side of the front of peace and democracy, and fully defends the friendship and peace of the peoples of all countries.

The Soviet-Bulgarian friendship, which was laid and inspired by Dimitrov's love and loyalty, is becoming stronger day by day, and our love for our mentor and father—the great Stalin—is becoming deeper and deeper.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the working people of Bulgaria, together with the communists and progressives all over the world, commemorate the seventieth anniversary of Dimitrov's birth and the third anniversary of his death, and at the same time express infinite loyalty and respect for his great cause.

    乔治·季米特洛夫——国际工人运动的杰出的活动家
    保加利亚共产党中央委员  阿夫拉莫瓦
    编者按：六月十八日是国际工人运动的杰出活动家季米特洛夫同志的七十诞辰，今天是他逝世三周年纪念日。我们特将保加利亚共产党中央委员阿夫拉莫瓦和保加利亚作家维·乔格耶夫的纪念文章发表在这里。
    保加利亚人民的领袖和导师、国际工人运动的杰出活动家、列宁和斯大林的有天才的学生和战友乔治·季米特洛夫，自诞生之日起到现在已满七十年，自逝世日起到现在也已满三年了。季米特洛夫是保加利亚工人阶级的儿子。最近五十年间，在保加利亚共产党和保加利亚工人运动的生活中，没有任何一件重大的事件，不是和季米特洛夫同志的名字及其领导活动联系着的。
    季米特洛夫的名字对于每个保加利亚的爱国者都是亲近和爱戴的。季米特洛夫是火热般的革命家和模范的列宁主义者——共产党员，他把自己最美丽的生活的大部分，都献给了国际工人运动。
    联共（布）领袖所发布的讣文中说：“乔治·季米特洛夫以自己在工人运动行列中的忘我斗争，以自己对列宁—斯大林的伟大学说的无限忠诚，博得了全世界劳动人民的热爱。”
    季米特洛夫同志是在光荣的保加利亚共产党的队伍中生长起来的无产阶级革命家和领导者。他经历过这样罕有的幸福，即多年在列宁和斯大林的身边和领导下进行工作。他终于形成了一个真正的列宁—斯大林型的领导者。
    季米特洛夫同志，在一九二三年人民反法西斯起义失败后，被迫侨居在国外，但没有停止对保加利亚共产党和保加利亚劳动人民反法西斯和反资本主义的斗争的领导。季米特洛夫同志把自己的活动和自己的炽烈的革命力量转移到辽阔的国际工人运动的舞台。
    季米特洛夫同志的名字，在国际工人运动中，是和工人阶级和劳动人民反对法西斯主义、反对掠夺的帝国主义战争的斗争联系在一起的。他的名字就是反法西斯斗争和反对战争斗争的象征。
    季米特洛夫面对莱比锡法西斯法庭的英勇斗争的功绩，在国际工人运动史中是永垂不朽的。在那个法西斯野兽的洞穴里，他不仅彻底粉碎了为迫害他而捏造的控诉，而且光辉地说出了自己的共产主义的信念，指出工人阶级的历史作用和刽子手们不可避免的灭亡。
    季米特洛夫在法庭面前，以自己英勇的行为告诉了全世界的革命者，当一个共产党员落到阶级敌人手中的时候，应当怎样进行斗争。他在莱比锡法庭上的行为，过去曾是、今天也仍然是资本主义世界里争取自由的战士所仿效的范例。
    带着镣铐的季米特洛夫在莱比锡法庭前面的火炽的演说中，沸腾着他对共产国际和伟大苏联的无限热爱。
    “不错，我是一个布尔什维克，我是一个无产阶级的革命家……。我的确是苏联共产党的热烈拥护者和崇敬者……，因为这个党正在管理着世界上最大的、占地球六分之一的国家，并且以伟大的领袖斯大林为首的这个党，正在英勇地和顺利地建设社会主义。”
    在称颂他的无比勇敢的行为的一切进步人类的面前，他向着发狂的戈林、法西斯的法官和警察说出了这些话。
    在莱比锡审讯过程中，这位无可责难的国际主义者和争取各族之间友爱的热情的战士季米特洛夫同志，也提供了爱祖国的鲜明的范例。他骄傲地卫护了那时任何人都没有保卫过使之免受敌人攻击的保加利亚民族的尊严和保加利亚人民革命的传统。
    “保加利亚人民以全力向外国的压迫进行了极顽强的战斗。因此我抗议对保加利亚人民的诬蔑。没有理由因为我是一个保加利亚人而引以为耻辱。我以我是保加利亚工人阶级的儿子而自豪。”
    他的纯洁的和热烈的爱国主义的范例，唤起了全世界劳动人民的喜悦，并把他们动员起来参加反对反动的资产阶级及其奴仆——右翼社会党人——的卖国的、反人民的政策的斗争。首先，这大大地帮助了保加利亚共产党人把保加利亚爱国者团结在自己的领导下去保卫国家的民族独立。
    季米特洛夫在莱比锡审讯过程中的胜利，告诉了全世界的工人和劳动人民，法西斯主义并不是像他们想要表现的那样可怕；并说明了，只要是反法西斯的人民力量团结起来反对它，那么是可以战胜它的。季米特洛夫在莱比锡的胜利的更重要的价值，就在于这个胜利是在德国法西斯掌握政权后获得的。这个胜利使争取推翻已在许多地方建立起来的法西斯专政的人民有了信心和力量，而且也反击了法西斯的进攻。全世界大规模展开的保卫季米特洛夫的运动和迫使法西斯法庭释放季米特洛夫的胜利，都证明了团结斗争的力量。工人阶级不能不作出这样的结论，团结就是斗争胜利的保证。特别是社会民主主义的工人不能不清楚地看见，只有他们和共产主义者成立统一战线，他们才能够获得成功。作为共产国际总书记的季米特洛夫同志，在莱比锡审讯后的期间，在这个基础上，在城市和农村的工人阶级和劳动人民的广泛团结的基础上，展开了自己的活动。
    保加利亚人民是首先亲身尝试到法西斯暴政的那些人民之一。一九二三年六月九日，团结在君主周围的反动派，利用政变的方法在国内建立起法西斯的专政。对民主力量的肆无忌惮的屠杀发生了。工人、农民和劳动的知识分子的愤怒是不可抑制的。保加利亚共产党的义不容辞的义务，就是起来领导劳动人民的斗争。作为列宁和斯大林忠诚的学生的季米特洛夫同志认为，只有劳动人民团结成统一的反法西斯战线，才能在斗争中获得成功。
    季米特洛夫同志在一九二九年曾写道：
    “没有统一的工人的战线，没有一切无产阶级和城乡劳动人民齐心协力地反对资本主义的行动，击溃资本家猛烈的进攻，铲除野蛮的法西斯，防止新的帝国主义战争，最后，解放无产阶级革命的胜利，都是不可能的。”
    后来，在一九三五年，季米特洛夫同志在共产国际第七次代表大会上的报告中，运用联共（布）的丰富经验和根据斯大林同志的指示，光辉地制订了人民阵线的策略，并确定了共产党在反对法西斯主义进攻的斗争中的总路线。
    在这个或那个国家里用什么方法能够防止法西斯主义和战胜法西斯主义——这个问题曾激动了全世界数以百万计的工人和劳动人民，季米特洛夫同志解说得很明确，而且指出法西斯主义的道路是可以阻止的，同时这件事系于工人、农民和所有劳动人民的本身。
    通过对法西斯政府的首脑以及改良组织的反动头子的斗争，他向全世界的工人和劳动人民呼吁，号召他们把自己的力量团结在国际反法西斯的阵线中，以反对法西斯主义和反动派、反对帝国主义在殖民地和半殖民地国家的统治和日益临近的战争危机。
    季米特洛夫同志证明了，法西斯主义不是资本主义有力的标志，而是资本主义孱弱的标志；法西斯主义虽然凶暴，但却是不稳固的政权。他号召人民群众参加反法西斯主义及其军事侵略的英勇的统一的斗争。
    争取工人阶级团结的斗争——争取建立无产阶级的统一战线的斗争，是人民阵线斗争的基础。季米特洛夫同志在自己的报告中说：“首先应该做的，便是建立工人阶级的统一战线。”
    季米特洛夫指示说，共产党在统一的和人民的阵线中的先锋作用，要求加强党的思想性和组织性，要求党的干部有更高的原则性。当季米特洛夫同志任共产国际总书记的时候，他在各国共产党准备完成共产国际第七次代表大会所提出的任务时，做了巨大的组织工作和政治工作。他认为，全世界各国共产党的首要任务——不完成这个任务便不能实现自己的先锋队作用——便是在联共（布）的世界性的具有历史意义的经验基础上，迅速地布尔什维克化。季米特洛夫同志不仅领导保加利亚共产党走向布尔什维克化，而且也帮助了许多国家共产党从事摆脱非布尔什维克的残余的斗争事业。季米特洛夫同志对于各国共产党建立和培养坚强的布尔什维克干部的事业，也是非常关心的，这是他在国际工人运动中的伟大功绩之一。在联共（布）领袖们为季米特洛夫同志的逝世所发布的讣文中说：
    “季米特洛夫同志在国际共产主义运动的队伍中教导各国共产党的领导干部们忠于马克思列宁主义的伟大学说、忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则、忠于保卫他们本国人民群众的利益的事业方面，作了巨大的工作。”
    季米特洛夫同志认为，不断地学习伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说，是各国共产党及其干部们所迫切必需的。他自己就曾不断学习并要求其他的人也坚持不断地学习。
    “对于各国共产党，对于工人阶级的战斗的先锋队来说，经常地学习和通晓马克思列宁主义，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，像面包、空气和水一样需要。轻视理论的态度，倾向于经验主义，必须尽可能快些结束。”
    “同志们，必须学习，无论在什么地方，在斗争过程中，在自由中和在监狱中，都必须不断地学习。”
    季米特洛夫同志强调说，共产党的干部不仅必须学习马克思列宁主义，而且也要学习创造性地运用马克思列宁主义。他自己的每一个行动，在他的每次讲话中，都给了我们创造性应用马克思列宁主义的范例，给了我们列宁—斯大林型的领导者的范例。季米特洛夫同志认为，各国共产党应该向联共（布），首先向斯大林同志，学习创造性的应用马列主义：
    “国际共产主义运动的全部经验证明了这个真理：谁如果不是真正的列宁主义者，他就不可能是真正的马克思主义者，谁如果不是真正的斯大林主义者，他就不可能是真正的列宁主义者。”与此同时，季米特洛夫同志也指出了可以锻炼成布尔什维克干部的唯一的正确道路——奋不顾身的斗争的道路。
    季米特洛夫同志写道：
    “在布尔什维克的斗争中，毫不动摇的和无限忠诚于工人阶级的事业，才不愧于列宁主义者——斯大林主义者的这个光荣称号。”
    必须强调指出，季米特洛夫同志在普及联共（布）在国际共产主义运动中的领导作用和巩固各族人民和伟大的苏联——他们的自由和独立的保证——的友谊方面，有着非常的功绩。他号召各国共产党团结在联共（布）的周围，为世界无产阶级团结在苏联工人阶级的周围而工作。他认为各国共产党在联共（布）周围团结成统一的共产主义运动，是绝对必要的，他认为这个运动可以促进各国共产党的政策和目标的一致，可以使各国共产党的行动遵从着一个理论——列宁和斯大林的伟大学说。
    季米特洛夫同志揭露了社会主义政党和工会的反动领袖们，他们“与本国的统治阶级血肉相连，他们同样也害怕工人阶级的胜利，而且在国际政策和国内政策的一切基本问题上和资产阶级是一致的”，他们以反对苏联的行动帮助法西斯分子和战争贩子。季米特洛夫说过：
    “检查资本主义国家中每一个工人运动的活动家、每一个工人党和劳动者的组织、每一个民主主义者是否忠诚和真挚的试金石，便是他们对伟大的社会主义国家的态度。”同时他又说过，“在法西斯主义、战争和资本主义力量与和平、民主和社会主义力量之间的历史的分水岭，实际上就是对苏联的态度，不是对苏维埃政权和社会主义的一般表面上的态度，而是对已经实际存在了二十年的苏联及其反对敌人的不断斗争、及其工人阶级专政、斯大林宪法和列宁—斯大林党的领导作用的态度。”
    季米特洛夫同志非常憎恨资产阶级的民族主义和沙文主义，并对它们在工人运动中的表现进行无情的斗争。他说道，没有反对资产阶级思想及其在工人运动中的传导者——右翼社会民主党人——的不断斗争，没有和资产阶级的民族主义和沙文主义——资产阶级思想的表现——的斗争，就不能有共产党员的真正马克思列宁主义的教育，就不能在共产主义运动的工作中获得成功。
    共产国际第七次代表大会后的事件，证明了指给各国共产党的政策的正确性。人民阵线的策略完全被证明是正当的。这个政策的正确性在第二次世界大战期间表现得尤其明显，当时在被希特勒匪帮所占领的各国，数以百万计的工人、农民和知识分子在各国共产党领导之下团结成强有力的人民阵线，并起来从事保卫本国的自由和独立的勇敢斗争。通过前线，通过法西斯的哨兵线和堡垒，人民把自己的斗争和光荣的苏军的斗争、和伟大的苏维埃人民的斗争结合成一个总的不可分又不可动摇的反对法西斯主义、反对反动势力和战争的世界阵线。
    在中欧和东南欧的许多国家中，工人、农民和其他一切劳动人民在共产党的领导下结成人民阵线，同时依靠着苏军在第二次世界战争中的历史性胜利，建立了人民民主的政权。伟大的中国人民多年来的英勇斗争，也获得了胜利。这个胜利，如季米特洛夫同志所说，是那些使忘形了的美帝国主义者的计划发生紊乱和被推翻的重大因素之一。
    季米特洛夫同志在共产国际第七次代表大会上所讲并在以后的许多论文中所研究的，今天获得了更大的力量。他对德国法西斯主义的评定是这样的：
    “这不仅是资产阶级的民族主义，这是兽性的沙文主义，这是强盗政治的政体，是对工人阶级和革命的农民、小资产阶级和知识分子的挑拨和拷问制度。这是中世纪的野蛮行为和兽行。这是对其他人民和国家毫无顾忌的侵略。德国法西斯主义是国际反革命的急先锋，是帝国主义战争的主要挑拨者，是反对苏联——全世界劳动人民的伟大祖国——的十字军的煽动者。”
    这些评定完全适用于狂热地准备第三次世界大战的美英帝国主义者及其野蛮的道德理论和他们在朝鲜进行的非人的毁灭性战争，适用于他们对人民，首先是对和平堡垒——伟大苏联的粗野憎恨。
    团结着世界各处的亿万人口的争取和平的强有力的世界运动，是在广泛得多的基础上、在第二次世界大战以后创立的新条件下、在增长为强有力的以苏联为首的统一的世界反帝的和平战线的人民阵线的策略指导下发展起来的。今天，全世界大多数普通人都明白，如果不制止帝国主义反动派，就不可能保卫住人民的自由和独立，就不能保卫民主和消除第三次世界战争的危险。同时能完成这种制止的是他们自己——数以百万计的团结成有力的争取和平的世界运动的人民。斯大林同志说过：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”这句话给与人们保卫和平斗争的信心和力量。各国人民间的友谊，一天天更巩固，他们对胜利的意志更坚强了。
    在保加利亚由希特勒占领下和法西斯压迫下解放以后，季米特洛夫同志回到了祖国并领导建立了人民民主国家。季米特洛夫同志的伟大功绩，是他在理论上综合了有关保加利亚人民民主制度的性质、任务和前途的材料。由斯大林同志的指示出发并遵从着这些指示，依靠着自己的渊博的理论准备和丰富的革命经验，他解决了在建立人民民主国家——无产阶级专政的新形式——时的新条件下所发生的问题。
    十年以前由季米特洛夫的发起和领导所建立的祖国阵线，今天是保加利亚人民最富于群众性的组织和人民政权的有力支柱。在保加利亚共产党的领导下，以季米特洛夫事业的真正忠实的学生和继承者——保加利亚共产党总书记和保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席契尔文科夫同志为首，保加利亚人民热情地完成着祖国社会主义基础的建设工作。由于伟大的苏联和斯大林同志本人的巨大的全面的兄弟般的帮助，第一个季米特洛夫五年计划将以四年时间在今年完成。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚的劳动人民，神圣地保持着季米特洛夫同志所遗给我们的国际主义的传统。今天保加利亚人民共和国坚决地站在和平和民主阵线这方面，并全力保卫各国人民的友谊与和平。
    季米特洛夫同志以热爱和忠诚所奠立和鼓舞着的苏保友谊，一天天更加坚强了，我们对于我们的导师和父亲——伟大的斯大林的热爱，也愈来愈深。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚的劳动人民，和全世界共产党人和进步人士，共同纪念季米特洛夫诞生的七十周年日和逝世三周年，同时对他的伟大事业表示无限的忠心和尊敬。　（君强、刘竞合译）（附图片）
