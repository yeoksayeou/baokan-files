　　I am determined to continue to increase the number of characters I set
　　Comrade Editor: I am a typesetter at the Kaifeng Public-Operated Dazhong Printing Factory. I have won the glorious title of labor model for creating a new record of setting three thousand six hundred characters per hour. I am determined to fight back against the aggression of American imperialism with practical actions to increase production. In addition to hoping that my working methods can be promoted, I also guarantee to do the following:
　　1. Continue to give play to my creativity and, in the shortest possible time, increase the number of characters I set from an average of 2,800 characters per hour to a minimum of 3,000 characters per hour, and improve the quality from one in a thousand to 0.80 in a thousand, and strive to overfulfill the task.
　　2. Patiently and unreservedly teach my working methods to all comrades in the typesetting group in the factory, and promote them to typesetting worker brothers throughout the country.
　　3. Conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, unite the comrades in the factory, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, improve technology, reduce waste, and increase the quantity and quality of products to create more wealth for the motherland.
　　4. Strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to improve my political and cultural level. Zhang Jiying
　　Editor's note: Regarding the first question raised by labor model Xu Fengying, we have recently introduced some experiences in consolidating the Hao Jianxiu working method for reference; regarding the second and third questions, we will write a letter to the Hao Jianxiu group to ask them to introduce their experiences in detail.
　　Hoping for an introduction to the experience of the Hao Jianxiu group
　　Comrade Editor: I am a worker at the State-Operated Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory. I want to tell you about my recent work and my requirements for the Party newspaper. The leading cadres in my factory support my work, but because they are busy leading "movements" all day long, they cannot help me in a concrete and in-depth way. In addition, we have many meetings and too little time for study. For example, after we challenged the Hao Jianxiu group, we had very little time to conduct inspections.
　　Our group adopted the Hao Jianxiu working method very early on and promoted it throughout the factory. Now, I hope the Party newspaper can solve these problems for me: 1. What specific methods should be adopted to consolidate the Hao Jianxiu working method? 2. How can we continuously improve the understanding and work enthusiasm of the group's employees? 3. What specific work experience does the Hao Jianxiu group have?
　　Industrial Labor Model Xu Fengying
　　Mutual Aid Team Leader Shen Sihu Overcomes Selfish Thoughts
　　Comrade Editor: To run a mutual aid team well, it is necessary to select a good mutual aid team leader. Our mutual aid team leader in Nanliu Village, Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, was originally Comrade Shen Sihu. He once led the mutual aid team to overcome many difficulties, enabling everyone to live a prosperous life. But recently, Shen Sihu was unwilling to be the mutual aid team leader. He said, "Being a cadre means attending many meetings, with little time, planning every day...it's too troublesome!" As a result, our team allowed Shen Youqun, who doesn't love labor, to become the leader. Shen Youqun cannot lead everyone in production by setting an example, but instead, he doesn't go to the fields himself and slips away to wander around when he has the chance. As a result, the mutual aid team is collapsing day by day.
　　Later, Shen Sihu attended the district and village cadre expanded meeting. At the meeting, Wang Wengui, the district party secretary, criticized the erroneous thinking of some party members who abandoned leadership over mutual aid and cooperation. Shen Sihu began to realize that he had selfish and self-serving thoughts. After two days of study, he finally criticized his own thinking and resolved to come back and lead the mutual aid team well. After Shen Sihu returned to the village, he made a self-criticism at the branch meeting, criticizing his "retreat" and his fear of trouble, and guaranteed to all party members of the branch that he would do a good job in the mutual aid team. Now, Shen Sihu is once again our mutual aid team leader, leading our production, and has also signed a "disaster prevention and labor protection" contract. A new atmosphere has emerged in our team.
　　Wei Chengcai Shi Zhangyou Jiang Linxiu Shen Canghai, State-Operated Sa County Farm, Suiyuan Province
　　Treating Tractor Drivers with Localism
　　The brief commentary "Overcoming Localism and Rationally Using Specialized Talents" published in the People's Daily on May 19th sparked a heated discussion among us. We believe that this is indeed a serious problem.
　　In some organizations, localism is very serious. They only see their own organization and their own locality, but they do not see the interests of the entire country. For example, at the State-Operated Sa County Farm in Suiyuan Province, more than 20 tractor drivers and tractor repair technicians were left without work last year due to changes in management policies. The relevant leaders did not send these technical personnel to the State-Operated Farm Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for reassignment, for fear of being transferred out of Suiyuan Province. They transferred these people from the farm back to the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry for a period of time, and then assigned a few people to drive cars and assigned others to other jobs. Some farms need such people, but they treat them like this.
　　Today, we are raising this situation again, hoping to attract the attention of the relevant parties.
　　Li Yulin and Ten Others, Forestry Cadre School of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government
　　Xixian People's Government Deceived by Blindly Trusting Unscrupulous Merchants
　　Comrade Editor: The Lixi Bridge project west of Xixian City on the Henan Xinxin Highway was contracted to the merchant Yu Shaoshan by the Xixian People's Government last October. This project was completed at the end of January this year, costing more than 110,000 jin of grain.
　　During the construction of the bridge, the unscrupulous merchant Yu Shaoshan cut corners and disregarded the quality of the project. The local people generally reflected: "The bridge openings are too small and there is danger." However, the county people's government did not listen to the opinions of the masses at all, did not seriously study the terrain and water conditions, blindly trusted the unscrupulous merchants, and allowed them to act recklessly. After the project was completed, the masses all said, "Don't look at the smooth and beautiful appearance; it's very loose and rotten inside and will collapse at any moment." Sure enough, in less than three months, when the river rose, the wing walls of the bridge collapsed on both ends. After the accident, the county people's government neither dealt with it seriously nor strictly investigated responsibility. Instead, they listened to the unscrupulous merchants and used 46,000 jin of grain as a subsidy to allow the unscrupulous merchants to repair and add two flowing water holes to the bridgehead. In fact, if the bridge openings are not enlarged, adding a few more holes will be in vain. Before rebuilding the bridge, the county people's government did not report to or request instructions from the Huangchuan Prefectural Commissioner's Office. We suggest that the Huangchuan Prefectural Commissioner's Office should handle this matter.
　　Yan Yuanzhong Chang Jingzeng Li Dianji Li Bin
　　Shanxi Daily Should Seriously Treat Pictorial Work
　　Comrade Editor: The pictorials in newspapers are an important form of propaganda and agitation for newspapers. Therefore, newspapers should adopt a serious and responsible attitude when organizing and arranging pictorials. The working attitude of the pictorial editors of the Shanxi Daily is not serious and responsible enough, resulting in continuous errors in the recently published pictorials of the newspaper. The pictorial of May 12th – "May 1st Labor Day in the Capital" – actually reversed the two photos of the heads of the Central People's Government reviewing the parade on the Tiananmen rostrum and the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home on the viewing platform. The presidium passes and viewing passes worn by Chairman Mao and the heads of the central government and the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army were originally on the left chest, but the two photos flipped them to the right chest; Chairman Mao originally raised his right hand to answer the parade crowd, but the photo turned it into his left hand. The same error also appeared in the pictorial of the newspaper on April 28th. The pictorial mistakenly added the explanation that the photo of Qiao Lidong, secretary of the Qiaojiazhuang branch of the Communist Youth League in Jiexian County, leading the members of the League and young adults in his village to dig wells in drought prevention and resistance, was "This is Xu Bingwu, a militia model in Xujia Village, Jiexian County, leading the militiamen in his village to dig wells in the drought prevention and resistance campaign." This kind of error of putting the wrong hat on someone has caused adverse effects among the masses. In order to help the newspaper effectively improve pictorial work and correct the sloppy work style in editing, it is hoped that the Shanxi Daily pictorial editors will conduct a profound self-criticism.
　　Yi Su Peng Qishi Ren Yide
　　Hoping to Show Movies and Lend Books in Rural Areas
　　Comrade Editor: When the People's Daily commemorated the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," it convened literary and artistic symposiums for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and published the symposium records separately. I participated in the peasants' literary and artistic symposium. The reading group in our village discussed the three symposium records separately, and everyone recognized the importance of literature and art. The elementary schools and people's schools in our village pay more attention to literary and artistic propaganda work. In the movements to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the students of elementary schools and people's schools have performed some literary and artistic programs that can promote the movements. Many people from the neighboring villages of Caobali and Gouneihe brought the old and the young to our village to watch these literary and artistic performances, which shows that the literary and artistic activities in our village played a role in promoting the political movement at that time. In the future, we must strengthen our studies on this basis to revitalize literary and artistic activities.
　　The masses in our village are eager to watch movies. The film projection team has only come to our village once or twice. When the local troops were stationed in our village, they also showed a movie once. When the movie "The White Haired Girl" was shown in our village, everyone was not only educated, but also learned the songs from the movie. The masses in our village eagerly hope that the film projection team will come to the countryside to show us movies more often. If there are difficulties with the cost, the masses are willing to pay a few cents to watch movies.
　　Also, everyone urgently needs the mobile library to lend out easy-to-understand books and paintings. The masses hope to gain new knowledge and see new things. I hope the People's Daily will support the reasonable demands of our peasant masses and realize our wishes as soon as possible. Ma Lianxi
　　Newspapers and Periodicals Should Include Instructions on How to Sing Songs
　　Comrade Editor: The songs published in the first issue of "Songs" (compiled by the Art Administration of the Ministry of Culture, etc.) all have detailed "singing instructions." These "singing instructions" explain to the readers the characteristics, emotions, and singing methods of each song, as well as the strength and weakness of the tones and speed in certain sections and verses, so that the teachers or learners can deeply understand and master the emotions and tones of the song. This is an important method to promote the popularization of music. However, newspapers and periodicals rarely include such singing instructions when publishing songs, and simply note "bright and powerful, courageous and forward," etc., which causes many difficulties for the majority of the masses with lower musical levels when learning to sing, and therefore inevitably affects the popularization of music. I suggest that newspapers and periodicals include more detailed singing instructions when publishing songs. Yuan Yi

    我决心继续提高拣字数量
    编辑同志：我是开封市公营大众印刷厂的一个排字工人。我因为创造了每小时排三千六百字的新纪录，获得了劳动模范的光荣称号。我决心以提高产量的实际行动回击美帝国主义的侵略。我除了希望我的工作方法能够获得推广外，还保证做到以下几项工作：
    一、继续发挥创造性，在最短期间，把拣字数量由每小时平均二千八百字提高到每小时最低数为三千字，质量由千分之一提高到千分之○·八○，并争取超额完成。
    二、耐心地、毫无保留地把我的工作法全部教给厂内排字股全体同志，并向全国排字工人弟兄推广。
    三、认真贯彻毛主席关于增产节约的号召，团结全厂同志，发挥工人的积极性和创造性，改进技术，减少废品，提高产品数量和质量，为祖国创造更多的财富。
    四、努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，提高政治文化水平。张继英
    编者按：劳动模范徐凤英所提出来的第一个问题，我们最近已经介绍了一些巩固郝建秀工作法的经验，可供参考；对于第二、第三两个问题，我们要写信给郝建秀小组，让她们把经验详细介绍出来。
    希望介绍郝建秀小组的经验
    编辑同志：我是国营上海第十六棉纺织厂的工人，我要告诉你关于我最近的工作情况和我对党报的要求。我厂领导干部对我的工作是支持的，但因为他们整天忙于领导“运动”，所以不能具体深入地帮助我。另外，我们的会议较多，学习的时间太少。如我们向郝建秀小组应战以后，连进行检查的时间都很少。
    我们小组很早就采用了郝建秀工作法，并在全厂推广了这一方法。现在，我希望党报给我解决这几个问题：一、巩固郝建秀工作法要采用什么具体方法？二、怎样才能不断地提高小组职工的认识和工作热情？三、郝建秀小组有那些具体工作经验？

    互助组长申四虎克服了自私思想
    编辑同志：要想把互助组搞好，选拔一个好的互助组长是很必要的。我们山西潞城县南流村的互助组长原来是申四虎同志，他曾经领导互助组克服了重重困难，使大家能过丰裕的日子。但是最近申四虎不愿意当互助组长了，他说：“当干部开会多，时间少，天天计划……太麻烦啦！”结果我们这个组让一个不爱劳动的申有群当了组长。申有群不能以身作则领导大家搞生产，而是自己不上地，瞅空就溜逛，互助组因此一天天地垮下来。
    后来，申四虎出席区村干部扩大会议，会上，区委书记王文贵同志批判了某些党员对互助合作放弃领导的错误思想。申四虎开始觉悟到自己有自私自利的思想。经过两天学习，他终于批判了自己的思想，决心回来好好领导互助组。申四虎回村以后，在支部大会上作了检讨，批判了自己的“退坡”及怕麻烦的思想，并向支部全体党员保证要把互助组工作作好。现在申四虎又当了我们的互助组长，领导我们生产，还订了“防灾、劳保”合同，我们组内生长了一片新气象。

    以本位主义对待拖拉机手
    五月十九日人民日报登载的简评“克服本位主义思想，合理地使用专门人才”，引起了我们的热烈讨论。我们认为这的确是一个严重的问题。
    有的机关，本位主义思想十分严重。他们只看到本机关、本地方，却看不到整个国家的利益。如绥远省国营萨县农场，去年因经营方针改变，多出来的二十多个拖拉机手和拖拉机修理技工，未能分配工作。有关领导方面不把这批技术人员送到中央人民政府农业部国营农场管理局另行分配工作，怕调出绥远省去。他们把这批人从农场调回绥远省农林厅住了一个时期，之后，就把几个人分配去开汽车，把另外的几个人分配了别的工作。有的农场正需要这样的人，但是他们却这样对待这些人。
    今天，我们把这种情况再次提出来，希望引起有关方面注意。

    息县人民政府盲目信任奸商受了欺骗
    编辑同志：河南信新公路息县城西的李西桥工程，去年十月由息县人民政府包给商人余少山修筑。这一工程在今年一月底完工，开支粮食十一万多斤。
    在该桥建筑期间，奸商余少山偷工减料，不管工程质量。当地群众普遍反映：“修的桥孔太小了，有危险。”但县人民政府丝毫不听群众意见，不认真研究地势水情，盲目信任奸商，任凭他肆意妄为。工程完毕，群众都说：“莫看外表光滑好看，里面可松糟得很，一下子就要垮的。”果真不到三个月，河水上涨时，桥身翼墙就发生崩裂，两端倒塌。事故发生以后，县人民政府既不认真处理，严格追究责任，反听信奸商，以四万六千斤粮食作为补助费，让奸商修理并在桥头增添两个流水洞。其实，如果不放大桥孔，再加几个洞也是白搭。在重修桥以前，县人民政府既不报告，又不请示潢川专署。我们建议，潢川专署应处理这件事情。

    山西日报应严肃对待画刊工作
    编辑同志：报纸的画刊，是报纸进行宣传鼓动的重要形式，因此，报纸在组织与排列画刊时，就应采取严肃负责的态度。山西日报画刊编者的工作态度不够认真负责，致使该报最近出版的画刊连续发生错误。该报五月十二日的画刊——“五一劳动节在首都”，竟把中央人民政府各首长在天安门检阅台上检阅游行队伍和在观礼台上的中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表的两张照片翻登了。毛主席和中央各首长及志愿军归国代表所佩带的主席团证和观礼证原是在左胸前，这两张照片却把它翻到右胸上；毛主席向游行群众答礼时举的原是右手，照片上却变成左手。同样的错误，还出现在该报四月二十八日的画刊上。该期画刊把青年团解县乔家庄支部书记乔立冬领导本村团员和青壮年在防旱抗旱中掏井的照片，竟错加说明说：“这是解县许贾村的民兵模范许丙午，领导本村民兵们在防旱抗旱运动中进行打井的情形”。这种张冠李戴的错误，在群众中曾造成不良的影响。为帮助该报切实改进画刊工作，纠正编辑工作中的粗枝大叶作风，希望山西日报画刊编辑作深刻的检讨。

    希望到农村放映电影和出借书籍
    编辑同志：人民日报在纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年时，曾分别召开了工、农、兵文艺座谈会，并分别发表了座谈记录。我曾参加了农民的文艺座谈会。我村读报小组，分别讨论了这三个座谈记录，大家都认识了文艺的重要性。我们村里的小学和民校，对文艺宣传工作比较重视，在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命运动中，小学和民校学员曾演出一些能够推动运动的文艺节目。我们邻近的曹八里村和沟泥河村的许多人扶老携幼，都赶到我们村来看这些文艺节目的演出，这说明我村的文艺活动对当时的政治运动起了推动作用。今后，我们一定要在这个基础上，加强学习，使文艺活动活跃起来。
    我们村的群众迫切要求看电影。电影放映队只来过我们村一两次。本地的部队，在我村驻扎时，也曾放映过一次电影。电影“白毛女”在我村放映时，大家不但受到了教育，而且学会了电影里的歌曲。我们村的群众热烈期望电影放映队下乡来给我们多放映几次电影。如果费用问题有困难，群众愿意拿几个钱看电影。
    还有，大家迫切要求巡回图书馆出借浅近易懂的书画。群众希望得到新的知识，看到新的事物。我希望人民日报支持我们农民群众的合理要求，早日实现我们的愿望。马连喜
    报刊刊载歌曲应附注唱法说明
    编辑同志：最近“歌曲”（中央文化部艺术事业管理局等合编）第一期所刊登的歌曲，都附注有详细的“唱法说明”。这些“唱法说明”，向读者说明每首歌的特点、感情、唱法以及某些段、节中音调的强弱、速度，使教唱人或学唱人得以深刻地领会和掌握歌曲的感情和音调。这是推进音乐普及工作的重要方法。但各报刊刊登歌曲时，还很少附有这样的唱法说明，只是简单地注有“明快有力、勇敢向前”等字样，这对多数音乐水平较低的群众来说，在学唱时就有很多的困难，因而也就不可避免地影响了音乐的普及工作。我建议各报刊在刊载歌曲时，附注上较详细的唱法说明。    元一
