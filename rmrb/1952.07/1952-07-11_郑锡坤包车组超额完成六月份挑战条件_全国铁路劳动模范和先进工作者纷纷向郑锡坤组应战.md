Zheng Xikun's Locomotive Crew Exceeds June Challenge Targets
    National Railway Labor Models and Advanced Workers Challenge Zheng Xikun's Group
    The Zheng Xikun locomotive crew of locomotive No. 105 of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot has exceeded all challenge targets ahead of schedule in June. According to the original challenge plan of the Zheng Xikun locomotive crew, the average daily car kilometers should be 550 kilometers, the monthly overload should be 13,000 tons, and the monthly traction should be 20 million ton-kilometers. From the beginning of the challenge to June 25, they have achieved an average daily car kilometer of 564.3 kilometers, an overload of 42,111.1 tons, and a traction of 20.026 million ton-kilometers. Other conditions have also been basically completed or exceeded. For example, in order to strive to "pull overloads every trip and run 500 kilometers every day," so that the overload movement is combined with the 500-kilometer movement, they completed 500 daily car kilometers in 16 days out of 25 days, and the trains they pulled were all overloaded trains, with seven times pulling one million ton-kilometers per day. For another example, they originally planned to save 20% of washing, inspection and maintenance costs, but now they have saved 68.9%. They have written a letter to Chairman Mao reporting these excellent results and promised to continue to work hard to improve their awareness and continue to consolidate and develop the Zheng Xikun advanced operation method in the future.
    These achievements of the Zheng Xikun locomotive crew were obtained under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, and the active support of all parties. In June, they implemented the Zheng Xikun operation method, used the high-speed driving method, and actively contacted the dispatching department, so that the overload and 500 kilometers were well combined. At the same time, in order to consolidate and develop the Zheng Xikun operation method and improve maintenance technology, they signed a contact contract with the workers of the factory's third team. In order to realize the challenge condition of helping other three locomotive crews become Zheng Xikun-style overload, 500-kilometer movers, they formed a mutual aid group with these three locomotive crews, stipulating that the driver chiefs of the mutual aid group should hold joint meetings twice a month to discuss and check the work and study of each group. At the first meeting, Geng Benshan, the driver chief of No. 105, introduced their experience in ordering production increase and conservation plans to the three locomotive crews, and helped these three locomotive crews to formulate production increase and conservation plans.

    National railway labor models and advanced workers have responded to the challenge of the Zheng Xikun locomotive crew.
    Following Li Xikui, the national railway labor model and shunting team of Shenyang Station of the China-Chang Railway, and Yang Maolin, the freight forwarding clerk group of Harbin Station, proposed challenge conditions, Zhang Xiaofeng, the national railway labor model and shunting team of Siping Station of the China-Chang Railway, proposed the challenge conditions, guaranteeing that they would use only 20 minutes to assemble a train, half the time of the stipulated 40 minutes, and only 20 minutes to disassemble a train, 25 minutes shorter than the stipulated 45 minutes. The average number of trains assembled and disassembled per shift is 18, shortening the original assembly by 146.6 car hours and the disassembly by 183.3 car hours. The transfer time per vehicle is 2 hours, which is 1 hour shorter than the original plan. They also open 3 extra-long trains, pull 3,500 tons of extra weight, and open 5 express trains. Yuan Ziwen's locomotive crew of the Shanghai Locomotive Depot, who set a new national record for daily car kilometers of locomotives, guaranteed in the challenge letter to pull 20,000 ton-kilometers of overload per month, save more than 59 million yuan in fuel and maintenance costs within half a year, implement the Luning-style locomotive maintenance method, and learn fitter technology within half a year. Shen Boshu and Liang Lijin's two locomotive crews of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot guaranteed to reach or exceed 500 daily car kilometers on average per month, and decided that the two groups would exchange experiences with each other at any time, and become Zheng Xikun groups together by the end of November this year. Yu Zhou's locomotive crew of the Jiulonggang Locomotive Depot formulated a plan to pull 2.35 million ton-kilometers of overload per month from June to the end of the year, and signed an education contract with the veteran masters to learn and check locomotive technology, guaranteeing that two people will reach level 5 fitters and the remaining seven people will reach level 4 fitters before October 1. Wang Zhen, the national railway labor model, and all the staff of the Bengbu Branch Dispatching Office formulated challenge conditions, planning to organize 2,782 overloaded trains in the second half of the year to ensure that the branch completes the overloaded task of 168 million ton-kilometers. Grasp the source of goods and the flow of goods, formulate a tight operation plan, tighten the locomotive junction, and ensure the proper connection of trains and locomotives. By the end of this year, 50% of the locomotives used by the Bengbu Branch will be 500-kilometer locomotives. Resolutely overcome localism, and coordinate with neighboring bureaus to empty according to plan, and strengthen the correctness of the daily plan. Xing Xudong, the station master of Harbin Station and the national railway labor model, and other advanced workers of the station set out in the challenge letter: the entire station will increase production and save 6,000 tons of grain in the second half of this year. Sun Fengchi's locomotive repair team, the national railway labor model of the Jilin Locomotive Depot, guaranteed in the competition conditions to implement advanced maintenance methods and increase production and save 105.6885 million yuan this year. Zhou Zixin's freight team, the national railway labor model, plans to increase production, save and turn over more than 1.1 billion yuan in profits by the end of this year. The locomotive crew No. 2027 under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration guaranteed in the challenge letter to pull 25 million ton-kilometers per month. Complete an average of 450 kilometers of daily car kilometers and pull 20,000 tons of overload per month.

    郑锡坤包车组超额完成六月份挑战条件
    全国铁路劳动模范和先进工作者纷纷向郑锡坤组应战
    苏家屯机务段一○五号机车郑锡坤包车组，六月份提前超额完成了各项挑战条件。郑锡坤包车组原来挑战计划决定，每天平均完成日车公里五百五十公里，每月超轴一万三千吨，每月牵引两千万吨公里。他们从挑战开始到六月二十五日止，已达到日车公里平均完成五百六十四点三公里，超轴完成四万二千一百一十一点一吨，牵引两千零两万六千吨公里。其他各项条件也都基本完成或超过，如：为了争取作到“趟趟拉超轴，天天跑五百”，使超轴与五百公里运动结合起来，他们在二十五天中，已有十六天完成了五百日车公里，所牵引的列车都是超轴列车，有七次是每天牵引了一百万吨公里。又如：他们原计划节约洗检维修费百分之二十，现在已节约了百分之六十八点九。他们已把这些优良成绩写信报告毛主席，并保证今后一定继续努力提高觉悟，继续巩固和发展郑锡坤先进作业法。
    郑锡坤包车组这些成绩，是在共产党英明领导和苏联专家热忱帮助以及各方面积极支持下获得的。在六月份中，他们贯彻了郑锡坤作业法，运用着高速驾驶法，并且主动地和调度部门联系，使得超轴和五百公里很好地结合起来。同时为了巩固和发展郑锡坤作业法，提高检修技术，他们和工厂第三组工人签订了联系合同。为了实现挑战条件中的帮助其他三个机车包车组成为郑锡坤式的超轴、五百公里运动者，他们和这三个包车组组成了互助组，规定每月召开两次互助组司机长联席会议，讨论和检查各组工作和学习情况。在第一次会上，一○五号司机长耿本善把他们订增产节约计划的经验，介绍给三个包车组，并帮助这三个包车组订出了增产节约计划。（新华社）
