    To the Editor: Workers Jia Yuming, Dong Chunpu, and Sun Weiguo of the Technology Section of the Jinzhou Railway Administration Repair and Manufacturing Factory have created a new method for casting blank forging rings during the Full Load, Oversized Axle, 500-Kilometer Movement.

    In the past, when this factory cast forging ring blanks, the excessive thickness caused the outer layer to exert a pulling force on the interior during solidification. The outer layer had greater hardness and density, but the lathe operator had to remove this layer, leaving a portion with insufficient hardness and density. As a result, the quality of the finished product was low, with rejects sometimes reaching 10%, wasting manpower, work hours, and materials.

    Based on actual needs, Jia Yuming and others reduced the thickness from 45 mm to 35 mm. This made the changes in the blank's interior and exterior consistent, avoiding the past problem of different hardness and density between the inner and outer layers. This not only saved raw materials but also reduced manpower and smelting time. The product quality also reached 100%. By adopting this method, the state can save over 130 million yuan in a year.

### 铸造涨圈荒料的新方法

    铸造涨圈荒料的新方法
    编辑同志：锦州铁路管理局修制工厂技术室工友贾玉明、董春溥、孙维国，在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，创造了铸造涨圈荒料的新方法。
    这个工厂过去铸造涨圈料，由于厚度太大，在凝结时，外层对内部起着牵引作用，外层的硬度和密度都大，但车工又恰恰要把这一层车去，剩下的部分，硬度和密度就不够要求了，因而成品质量低，有时废品达到百分之十，且浪费人力、工时和原料。
    贾玉明等根据实际需要，把过去四十五粍厚度，降低到三十五粍。使荒料内部和外层的变化一致，避免了过去内外层硬度和密度不一样的毛病，这就不仅节约了原料，而且省去了人力和化铁的工时。产品质量也达到百分之百。由于采用这个方法，在一年内，可给国家节约一亿三千多万元。
