Speaking to the American People
Speech at the Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin on July 4th
Soviet Union, Ilya Ehrenburg

This spring, when I was in Copenhagen, a Danish woman said to me: "Everyone is talking about war, and I have three children. The newspapers say it's the Russians' fault, that they want to destroy the American way of life. I don't live according to the Russian or American way; I live my own life. I'm not saying it's anything special, but I don't want anyone to interfere with me. I don't understand politics, but this can't go on..."

"This can't go on..." This sentence resonates with everyone.

In the past year, the danger of war, if it hasn't increased, at least hasn't decreased. When a doctor talks about a person exhausted by prolonged illness, saying his condition is unchanged, it's worth worrying about.

Not only is the war dreamed of by a small group of war criminals terrible, but even more terrible is the frenzy of expecting war, mutual suspicion, lies, hatred, the dead walls separating one nation from another, the sound of weapons clashing, the younger generation growing up in confusion, and new inventions for manufacturing death that make it increasingly difficult to defend against.

The Korean mother hiding her children in the valley says, "This can't go on." The American mother whose son is in Korea answers, seemingly in anger, "This can't go on." The Chinese farmer cultivating his small patch of sorghum says, "This can't go on," and his words are echoed by the gauchos on the vast plains of Argentina. The world cannot survive without peace.

Why are the villages of unfortunate Korea engulfed in flames? Why are the mothers in fertile France going hungry? Why do these countries so increase their burden of armaments, making people physically emaciated, intellectually impoverished, and dimming their hopes for happiness under the weight of arms? Naturally, it is not difficult for the esteemed members of the World Peace Council to answer these questions: they know who avoids negotiations, who advocates separate treaties with Germany and Japan, who subjects Korea to unheard-of terror in world history, and who does everything possible to lower people's enthusiasm and poison the minds of millions with fear, anger, and hatred. But not everyone on Earth understands the causes of the disaster. The scope of the peace movement has already expanded, encompassing half of humanity. This is enough to give General Eisenhower, and even General Ridgway, pause, but it is not enough to bring peace to the world. We must think about the other half of humanity, touching the hearts of those who are lost and bewildered. The number of criminals who deliberately launch new wars is very limited; it doesn't reach one-thousandth of the total American population. I know America has hardworking farmers, honest workers, noble scholars, excellent writers, mothers holding infants tightly to their chests, and lovers dreaming of simple human happiness. I know America has millions of ordinary people who fear not only the Black Death but also the common cold; they become despondent when they hear about atomic war. Why are hundreds of millions of people still no match for a small group of thugs? Those conspirators and madmen who dream of new wars hold newspapers, radio stations, film companies, demagogues, instigators, and preachers in their hands. They have deceived and are deceiving not only millions of Americans but also many Europeans. Among those who distrust or even oppose the advocates of peace, few are advocates of war. Every deceiver has millions of deceived, and it is these deceived people that I want to convince. I want to speak frankly and without concealment.

The Danish woman I mentioned imagines that the Russians want to destroy the American way of life. So do some other Danes and many Americans. An old Spanish song has these two lines: "They don't know what they sing, but they sing what they know." Mr. Dulles said not long ago: "The Communists have designated America as the target for destruction. Soviet propagandists are shouting day and night that America is hateful and must be hated and conquered." Not only American newspapers but also responsible people like President Truman declare every few days that the Soviet Union is eager to destroy the "American way of life."

Every phrase can have various interpretations, but probably no phrase has as many different interpretations as "way of life." For President Truman, the "American way of life" is the policy of the State Department and the conspiracies of the Pentagon. For ordinary American citizens, the concept of the "American way of life" is their favorite life, work, family, a car, American football, jazz music, a stimulating movie, a lecture in his club, or a sermon in church, happy on Sundays and anxious on Mondays. Everyone has the right to like or dislike this way of life, to regard it as high or low, but if this way of life satisfies Americans, no one has any right to interfere with it. And no one is interfering with it. For millions of ordinary Americans, the term "American way of life" conjures up images of streamlined cars and good roads, building houses, electric refrigerators and televisions—whether he owns these things or has seen them in a store—the opportunity to shake hands with a senator or even the president, a sense of carefree willfulness, Sunday idealism that alleviates the relentless nature of the marketplace, democratic demeanor that conceals social inequality, and the illusion of a lucky chance that can turn a homeless beggar into an all-powerful millionaire. It is time for ordinary Americans to understand that the Russians are not flocking to seize his Ford car, the Chinese have no intention of interfering with American television programs, the Koreans are not coveting Mr. Smith's electric refrigerator, the Poles do not care whether the aforementioned Mr. Smith shakes hands with Dulles or even Truman, nor do they care about those cheap dreams of getting rich by millions or even tens of millions. Ordinary Americans should understand that many things depend on him, he can promote war or promote peace. No one is stopping him from living as he pleases, but if that small group of criminals is determined to use force to promote the "American way of life," then that way of life will collapse like a house of cards.

I never believe that a person who respects his mother would insult his neighbor's mother. I never believe that a person who considers his family sacred would commit crimes in his neighbor's home. Every nation cherishes its own way of life. Ordinary Americans who like the American way of life must respect the customs, laws, habits, and preferences of other nations. You cannot spread an idea with bombs. You cannot instill a preference with shells. You can kill a person with encephalitis bacteria or plague bacteria, but no bacteria can force a Chinese person to think and feel like General Ridgway. Those criminals who launched the war in Korea insist that they are defending the Lee Seung-man regime from communist aggression. I don't know whose taste the Lee Seung-man regime suits; even the ministers he appointed have betrayed him. But let us assume that this regime satisfies some Americans. Good, they have the right to admire him, but if they think that burning Pyongyang with gasoline bombs will convince most of its residents of the superiority of the "American way of life," they are greatly mistaken. The residents of Pyongyang are convinced of something else. They now know that it is entirely possible to be technologically advanced and lack conscience.

I have been to America, and there are many things I liked there, and many things I didn't like. I have met some Americans who have been to our country. In the Soviet Union, there are many things they liked, and many things they didn't like. These things can be debated, and from debate, it is said, truth can be derived. The American authorities declare every few days that they don't like the Soviet system. That is their business. For us Soviet people, we also find many things unpalatable in America. For example, we really hope that Americans would hate black-heartedness instead of black skin, and that they would respect people more and money less. But that is the American people's own business. Ordinary Americans must understand that attempting to deprive other nations of freedom in the name of their own freedom (whether real or false) will not work. "Voice of America" often announces to all people that an "Association for the Liberation of Russia" has been established in the United States, and its leader was recently the American ambassador to the Soviet Union. In my country, there is no and never could be an American Liberation Association. But we are extremely eager for America to abolish racial discrimination, and we know that this does not depend on the strengthening of Soviet armaments, but on the growth of the forces of justice in America. Hitler also talked about "liberating Russia." He wanted to liberate Russia from the Russians. Ordinary Americans would think that he did this because of the greed of the deceiver and the naivety of the deceived.

When an American soldier arrives in Le Havre or La Rochelle, he sees black slogans saying "Go home." He is angry, he is told that he has come to Italy or France to defend these countries from Russian aggression, and yet he hears shouts of "Go home!" They then rush to explain to the soldier that the Communists have poisoned the people, making them oppose Americans. I ask this uncomfortable American: do you really believe that this is a "Communist conspiracy"? Could Laval or Mussolini poison the people to make them oppose Americans? Why did the French welcome Eisenhower with flowers in 1944, and why did the same French shout "Go home" to the same Eisenhower in 1951? American young soldiers, this is probably not your fault. I don't think the citizens of Genoa or Bordeaux intend to embarrass you personally, but you have arrived as an unwelcome guest, they see you as a soldier of an occupying army. Why be angry with the French or Italians, rather blame those who sent you to Europe. Perhaps you think my words are biased? Good, if you doubt a Soviet writer's words, then think about Dulles' words, whose words should be beyond doubt. This is what he said on May 15th this year: "During my recent travels in the East and West, I had to note that we must face the embarrassing fact: many people in the world fear the Soviet army less than they fear America intensifying the atomic war, for which the residential centers of their countries are defenseless. Our administration does not have enough authority to restrict prominent figures holding high positions at home from making hawkish statements." American soldiers, that is why people shout "Go home!" at you! Don't take it to heart, this is still restrained. No one has ever shouted at Hitler's army to go home; people did not argue with them, they simply drove them out. No one has anything against you personally, but in the history of every nation, there have been crucial moments when the nation's good name, its honor, and its future are determined by the will of every citizen. Innocence and fatalism may indeed add charm to a person's private life, but they are inappropriate when it comes to the future of your country and the whole world. You have the right to choose the way of life that makes you happy, you have the right to choose between the Democratic and Republican parties, between two boxers or two movie stars, between psychoanalysis and geopolitics, between the Rocky Mountain Prairie and Florida beaches, but you have no choice between war and peace. No foreigner will come and ask you whether you are voting for this or that president, whether you are sponsoring the passage or rejection of this or that bill, but even if you are a kind and peaceful person, if your country's government authorities venture to launch a third world war, then the people of the whole world will hold you responsible.

There are journalists from various countries present in this venue, including Americans. I want to trust their honesty. Regardless of their opinions, their responsibility is to convey my words to their readers. I am speaking as a Soviet citizen, a Soviet writer. I am sure that what I am expressing is not only my personal opinion, but also the opinion of millions of my readers. It is untrue to say that we Soviet people hate America. We respect the American people, respect their genius, their scientific achievements, their inventions, and their industry. Personally, as a writer, I want to add that I highly value many American writers, although their views are often very different from mine. As a member of the people, I want to add that I have been to America and met many smart and kind people there. No one in the Soviet Union has ever infringed or will infringe on the American way of life. Let every nation live according to their views, let every nation find their own path to peace, so that one nation's ideals, interests, and preferences do not interfere with the life, thoughts, and creations of another nation. It will not work to forcibly impose the Chiang Kai-shek regime on China by relying on the votes of nineteen countries manipulated by the United States in the United Nations to support Chiang Kai-shek. Remember that not only is China's population twelve times the total population of the nineteen countries manipulated by the United States combined, but also that the people of every country (regardless of size) have the right to decide the regime they need. It will not work to force the Soviet Union to accept this or that resolution because Venezuela, Turkey, or the Philippines voted for it; an agreement must be reached with the representatives of the Soviet Union. Even if you gather all the people who have served as ambassadors in Washington and solemnly seal them as "liberators of Russia," the cause of peace will not progress in the slightest. Usually during election campaigns, American politicians are good at understanding the minds of voters, talking a lot about peace. But now they have become accustomed to the idea of war, and unconsciously reveal their war plans even while talking about peace. General Eisenhower said on June 7th that armaments are important, that he has no confidence in negotiating with the Soviet Union, that there is a "direct conflict between Eastern and Western concepts," and that he "has no panacea for easing tensions." Mr. Taft suggested on June 2nd that underground organizations conduct sabotage in all countries he called communist. Americans who hear my words may think that I am distorting the facts, that American political figures are all advocates of peace. I want to call on Mr. Balton, former Senator of the United States, to be a witness. Probably no one would suspect that he is sympathetic to the Soviet Union or the Communist Party, he once said that the best way to save Europe is to let Germany and the Soviet Union "destroy each other," and he supported Dias's anti-American activities committee when he was a member of Congress. This is what Mr. Balton said: "Of course everyone says it's for peace. The President is for peace, the Secretary of State is for peace, the Pentagon is for peace. But in fact all their thoughts, all their plans, all their expenses are all placed on war... For them, peace means eliminating more Chinese in Korea, eliminating more Indonesians in Indonesia, eliminating more Vietnamese in Vietnam, and assisting all countries in the world to prepare for war. If any leader of our country abroad, such as Nehru, has the courage to say 'I don't want to participate in this massacre,' he immediately becomes the target of concentrated fire from our propagandists... Our officials are not trying to find a way to coexist peacefully side by side with the Russians, but are only spending time bragging and intimidating."

I think there is no need to add anything to this heartfelt statement from a financial capitalist and anti-communist. To avoid the danger of war, people must sit at a table to negotiate. The Soviet people are willing to talk about peace with any American, whether he is a Progressive, Republican, or Democrat. They want to talk about peace with American workers, and also with American capitalists; they want to talk about peace not only with their friends, but also with their enemies. They want peace not because they are afraid or weak, but precisely because they are broad-minded.

Ordinary Americans may say that there are very sharp conflicts between the views of the United States and the Soviet Union on many issues. I am not a diplomat, I am neither an expert on atomic energy nor an expert on international law, I have always been a writer. But I know how many times our representatives have suggested to the Americans to start negotiations, and I also know how many times the Americans have refused to negotiate. I am told that this is difficult to coordinate. That's right, an agreement is not easy. Because this requires both sides to have the sincerity and desire to seek an agreement. When Nazism threatened Europe and America, the Soviet Union and the United States once agreed. In those terrible years, our soldiers and American soldiers fought side by side for peace. This, on our side, we have not forgotten. So, at that time there were also contradictions in ideals, differences in preferences, and conflicts of interest. Could a third world war be less of a disaster than Hitler?

Today is America's National Day. On July 4, 1776, the American people subdued those who treated them as slaves and established their independent republic. On this very day, I call on you, the citizens of America, remember the ideals that once inspired your earliest ancestors, let the leaders you are responsible for abandon "bragging and intimidation," and gather together with representatives of the Soviet Union and other great powers, honestly trying to reach an agreement. That way, you will save your country, your children, your future. A great peace conference will be held at the end of this year, this conference represents the lofty aspirations of all peoples. Let the American people understand the importance of this conference and send a delegation that can convey the will of every class and every party. I just want to state that they will find friends among the representatives of the Soviet delegation, friends who can respect the different paths of all nations, do not want to force others to accept their way of life, but want to save the lives, culture, and future of all mankind.

    向美国人民说话
    七月四日在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上的发言
    苏联  爱伦堡
    今年春天，当我在哥本哈根的时候，有一位丹麦的妇女对我说：“人人都在谈打仗，我有三个孩子呢。报纸上说这是俄国人的过错，他们要摧毁美国的生活方式。我不是按照俄国的或者美国的方式生活的，我过着我自己的生活。我并不是说它有什么特别，可是我不要任何人干涉我。我不懂政治，但是不能这样下去……”
    “不能这样下去……”这句话唤起了每一个人的共鸣。
    在过去一年中，战争的危险如果没有增加的话，至少也没有减少。当医生讲到一个被长久病痛弄得筋疲力竭的人，说他的情况无变化，那就很值得耽心了。
    不仅一小撮战争罪犯所梦想的战争是可怕的，更可怕的是那种期待战争的狂热，互相猜疑，谎言，仇恨，把一个民族和另一个民族分隔开的死墙，武器碰撞的声音，年轻一代胡里胡涂地长大，使人愈来愈难以防御的、制造死亡的新发明。
    把孩子藏在山谷中的朝鲜母亲说：“不能这样下去”，儿子在朝鲜的美国母亲像是回答似的气愤地说道：“不能这样下去”。在耕种着他那小块高粱田的中国农民说：“不能这样下去”，他的话得到了阿根廷广阔草原上的哥楚族人的共鸣。世界是不能没有和平而生存的。
    为什么不幸的朝鲜的村庄烈焰冲天呢？为什么土地肥美的法国的母亲们要挨饿呢？为什么那些国家这样加重它们的武装负担，使人们在武装之下弄到身体憔悴、思想贫乏和幸福的希望黯淡呢？自然，对于这些问题，世界和平理事会可敬的理事们是不难回答的：他们知道是什么人规避协商，什么人授意对德国和对日本的单独和约，什么人使朝鲜蒙受世界历史上闻所未闻的恐怖，什么人竭尽其力降低人们的热情，而以恐惧、愤怒和仇恨毒害千百万人的心灵。但是并不是地球上所有的人都明白灾祸的原因。和平运动的范围已经扩大了，它包罗了一半的人类。这是足以叫艾森豪威尔将军、甚至李奇微将军有所顾忌的，但是还不足以使世界太平。我们必须想到另外的一半人类，打动那些茫然无所适从的人们的心。那一小撮处心积虑发动新战争的罪犯数目有限得很，它到不了美国总人口的千分之一。我知道美国还有勤劳的农民、诚实的工人、高贵的学者、优秀的作家、把婴孩紧抱在胸前的母亲和梦想着单纯的人类幸福的恋人们。我知道美国有千百万平民，他们不仅怕黑死病，而且也怕通常的伤风；他们提到原子战争就会颓然绝望。为什么几亿人民还抵不过一小撮暴徒呢？那些梦想着新战争的阴谋家和疯子们手中握有报纸、广播电台、电影公司、煽动家、挑拨家、说教者。他们欺骗了而且在欺骗着不仅千百万美国人，还有许多欧洲人。在那些不信任甚至敌视和平拥护者的人们中间，很少是战争拥护者的。每一个骗徒有千百万被骗者，我想要说服的就是这些受了骗的人。我要直言而无所隐讳。
    我所提到的那一位丹麦妇女，是设想俄国人要摧毁美国生活方式的。其他一些丹麦人和许许多多美国人也是如此。西班牙古歌中有这样的两句：“他们不知道他们所唱的，然而他们唱他们所知道的。”杜勒斯先生不久以前说过：“共产党已经把美国指定为破坏的目标。苏联的宣传家不分白天黑夜都在高声嚷叫美国可恶，美国必须被憎恨和征服。”不仅是美国报纸，像杜鲁门总统这种负责的人也三天两日宣称苏联渴望摧毁“美国生活方式”。
    每一辞句都可以有各种各样的解释，但是大概没有像“生活方式”这样的辞句有这么多种不同的解释的了。对于杜鲁门总统，“美国生活方式”就是国务院的政策和五角大楼的阴谋。对于普通的美国公民呢，“美国生活方式”这一概念则是他们所喜爱的生活，工作，家庭，一辆汽车，美国足球，爵士音乐，一张有刺激性的影片，他的俱乐部里的一场讲演或者教堂中的一次布道，星期天开心而星期一焦心。每一个人都有权利喜欢或者不喜欢这样的一种生活方式，把它看得高或者看得低，但是如果这种生活方式使美国人满意，没有人有任何权利去干涉它。而且也并没有人去干涉它。对于千百万普通的美国人，说到“美国生活方式”这个名词，就会联想到流线型汽车和好马路，联想到构造房屋，联想到电气冰箱和电视机——不管他是占有这些东西或是在铺子里看到过，联想到和一个参议员或者甚至总统握手的机遇，联想到一种逍遥自在的任性，联想到聊以冲淡每天商场无情的那种星期日理想主义，联想到掩饰社会不平等的民主风度，联想到会使一个无家可归的乞丐变成为万能的百万富翁的幸运机会的幻想。这是普通美国人应当明白的时候了，俄国人并非群集而抢夺他的福特牌小汽车，中国人没有意思要干预美国的电视节目，朝鲜人没有垂涎史密斯先生的电气冰箱，波兰人毫不关心上述这位史密斯先生是否和杜勒斯或者甚至杜鲁门握手，也不关心那些想发几百万甚至几千万大财的廉价美梦。普通的美国人应当明白，许多事情都有赖于他，他可以促进战争也可以促进和平。没有人不让他按照自己所乐意的那样生活，但是如果那一小撮罪犯决心要用武力来推行“美国生活方式”的话，那么，那种生活方式便将会像纸牌搭成的房子一样地坍塌。
    我从来不相信一个尊敬自己母亲的人会凌辱邻人的母亲。我从来不相信一个认为自己家庭是神圣不可侵犯的人会在邻人的家里为非作歹。每一个民族都珍爱自己的生活方式。喜欢美国生活方式的普通美国人必须尊重别的民族的风俗、法律、习惯、嗜好。你不能用炸弹去传布一种观念。你不能用炮弹去灌输一种嗜好。你可以用脑炎菌或者鼠疫菌杀死一个人，但是没有一种细菌能强迫一个中国人像李奇微将军一样地思想和感觉。那些在朝鲜发动战争的罪犯们硬说他们是保卫李承晚政权不让共产党侵犯。我不知道李承晚的政权合乎什么人的口味，连他所委任的部长也叛变了。但是我们姑且假定这个政权是叫某些美国人满意的吧。好的，他们有权利赞赏他，但是如果他们认为用汽油弹把平壤烧毁就能使那里大多数的居民信服“美国生活方式”的优越性，那就大错特错了。平壤居民所信服的是另外的一些东西了。他们现在知道富有技术而缺乏良心是完全可能的。
    我曾到过美国，在那里，有许多东西是我所喜欢的，也有许多东西是我所不喜欢的。我曾遇见过到过我国的一些美国人，在苏联，有许多东西是他们所喜欢的，也有许多东西是他们所不喜欢的。这些事情可以展开争论，从争论中据说可以得出真理。美国当局三天两日就宣称他们不喜欢苏联的制度。那是他们的事情。对于我们苏联人民，在美国我们也发现有许多东西是不合口味的，譬如，我们真的希望美国人厌恶黑心肠而不是厌恶黑皮肤，希望他们少敬金元多敬人。但是，那是美国人自己的事情。普通美国人必须明白，企图在他们自己的自由（真的也好，假的也好）的名义下剥夺其他民族的自由，那是不成的。“美国之音”经常对一切人们宣布，在美国已成立了一个“俄国解放协会”，它的头目最近还当过美国驻苏大使。在我的国家中，是没有也从来不可能有一个美国解放协会的。但是我们万分渴望美国废除种族歧视，我们知道这并不是靠苏联武装的增强，而是有赖于美国正义力量的增长。希特勒也谈过“解放俄国”。他是要从俄国人手中解放俄国。普通美国人都会认为是由于骗徒的贪欲和受骗者的天真使得他这样干的。
    有个美国士兵到了勒格亨或者拉·罗舍尔，他看见黑色的标语写着“滚回家去”。他生气了，他被告诉说他是到意大利或者法国来保卫这些国家不让俄国人侵犯的，而他却听到喊叫：“滚回家去！”他们就急忙向那士兵解释说，是共产党毒化了人民，使他们反对美国人。我试问这个难受的美国人：你真的会相信这种事情是一种“共产党阴谋”吗？赖伐尔或者墨索里尼能够毒化人民使他们反对美国人吗？为什么一九四四年的时候法国人曾以鲜花欢迎艾森豪威尔，而同是这一个法国人在一九五一年却向同一个艾森豪威尔呼喊“滚回家去”呢？美国的青年士兵呀，这大概都不是你的错处，我以为并不是热那亚或者波尔多的公民有意叫你个人难堪，可是你是作为一个不受欢迎的客人到来的，他们把你看作一个占领军的士兵。何必生法国人或者意大利人的气呢，不如怪责把你送到欧洲来的那些人吧。也许你认为我说话是有偏见的吧？好的，如果你怀疑一个苏联作家的话，那么想一下杜勒斯的话吧，此人的话应该是无可怀疑的了。这是他在今年五月十五日所说的话：“我最近在东方和西方的旅行中不得不注意到，我们必须面对难堪的事实：世界上许多人民害怕苏联军队还没有像害怕美国加紧发动原子战争那么厉害，对于原子战争，他们国家的住宅中心是毫无防御的。我们行政当局并没有充分的权力去限制国内高据要津的知名人士发表好战的声明。”美国士兵呀，那就是为什么人们对你喊“滚回家去！”别放在心里吧，这还是有分寸的啦。没有人对希特勒的军队喊过叫他们回家去；人们是不和他们争论的，干脆把他们撵出去。没有人会跟你个人怎样过不去的，但是在每一个民族的历史上都有过紧要关头，那时候民族的好声名，它的荣誉，它的前途就决定于它每一个公民的意志了。天真无邪以及听天由命的态度诚然会在一个人的私生活中给他增添魅力，但是如果关系到你的国家和整个世界的前途的话，那么它们就未免不合时宜了。你有权利选择使你开心的那种生活方式，你有权利在民主党和共和党中间选择其一，在两个拳师或者两个电影明星中间，在心理分析和地缘政治学中间，在洛机山草原和佛罗里达海滩中间选择其一，但是在战争与和平之间你没有选择的余地。没有外国人会来要你回答你是投这个还是那个总统的票，你是赞助通过还是否决这项或者那项法案的，但是纵使你是一个善良与和平的人，如果你的国家的政府当局冒险发动第三次世界大战，那么全世界人民将会要你负责。
    在这个会场内有各国的新闻记者出席，其中也有美国人。我要信任他们的诚实。不论他们持什么意见，他们的责任是把我的话传给他们的读者。我是以一个苏联公民，一个苏联作家的身份讲话的。我确信我所表达的不仅是我个人的意见，而且是千百万我的读者的意见。说我们苏联人民仇恨美国是不真实的。我们敬重美国人民，敬重他们的天才，他们科学上的成就，他们的创造发明，他们的工业。以我个人来说，作为一个作家，我要补充说，我对许多美国作家是评价很高的，虽然事实上他们的观点时常和我的大不相同。以一个人民的身分来说，我要补充说，我曾到过美国，在那里遇到过许多又聪明又善良的人。在苏联没有一个人曾经侵犯或者将会侵犯美国生活方式的。让每一个民族按照他们的看法去生活吧，让每一个民族自己去找寻和平的途径吧，那样，一个民族的理想、兴趣和嗜好就不要干预另外一个民族的生活、思想和创造。凭着十九个被美国操纵的国家在联合国投票支持蒋介石而强置蒋政权于中国是不成的。要记得不仅是中国的人口十二倍于十九个被美国操纵的国家加在一起的人口总数，而且每一个国家（不论大小）的人民都有权利决定他们自己所需要的政权。说是因为委内瑞拉、土耳其或者菲律宾投了票就要强使苏联接受这项或者那项决议，这是不成的；必须和苏联的代表们取得协议。即令你们把所有曾经当过大使的人召集在华盛顿开会，庄严地封他们为“俄国的解放者”，和平事业也绝不会因此而有丝毫进展的。通常在竞选的时候，美国的政客就善于摸选民的心思，大谈其和平。但是现在他们已变成习惯于战争的念头了，在谈和平之中也不知不觉地泄露了他们的战争计划。艾森豪威尔将军在六月七日说，武装要紧，他对和苏联谈判并无信心，“在东方和西方的观念之间有直接的冲突”，他“并无缓和紧张局势的万灵药方”。塔夫脱先生六月二日曾建议地下团体的组织在所有他称为共产党的国家中进行破坏活动。听到我的话的美国人会以为我歪曲事实，美国的政界人物都是主张和平的。我要叫美国前任参议员巴尔顿先生当证人了。恐怕没有人会怀疑他是同情苏联或者共产党的，他有一次说过挽救欧洲最好的办法是让德国和苏联“互相毁灭”，而他当众议员的时候曾经支持过戴斯的非美活动委员会的勾当。这就是巴尔顿先生说的：“当然每一个人都说是为了和平。总统是为了和平，国务卿是为了和平，五角大楼是为了和平。但是事实上他们的一切念头、他们的一切计划、他们的一切开支都全部放在战争上……对于他们，和平是意味着在朝鲜消灭更多的中国人，在印度尼西亚消灭更多的印度尼西亚人，在越南消灭更多的越南人，以及援助世界各国进行备战。如果我们国外任何国家的一个领袖人物，例如像尼赫鲁，有勇气说出‘我不要参加这场屠杀’，他立刻就成了我们宣传家集中火力的目标……我们的官员不是设法找寻与俄国人携手并肩和平共存的道路，而只是把时间化在吹牛与恐吓上。”
    我想对于这样一位金融资本家和反共人物的这番由衷之言，是不必再有所补充的了。为避免战争的危险，人们必须坐在一个桌子上来进行谈判。苏联人民愿和任何美国人讲和平，不管他是进步党、共和党还是民主党。他们要和美国的工人们讲和平，也要和美国的资本家讲和平；他们不仅要和他们的友人讲和平，也要和他们敌人讲和平。他们要和平并不是因为他们害怕或软弱，而正是因为他们心胸广大。
    普通美国人也许会说美国和苏联之间在许多问题的观点上存在着很尖锐的冲突。我不是外交家，我既不是原子能问题专家也不是国际法专家，我自始至终是一个作家。但是我知道我国的代表曾多少次向美国人建议开始谈判，我也知道美国人多少次拒绝谈判。我被告诉说，这是难以协调的。一点不错，协议是不容易的。因为这需要双方具备觅致协议的诚意和愿望。当纳粹主义威胁欧洲和美国的时候，苏联和美国是曾经协议过的。在那些可怕的年月里，我们的士兵和美国的士兵并肩为和平而战。这个，在我们方面，我们并没有忘记。那么，那个时候也有着理想的矛盾、嗜好的差别和利益的冲突呵。难道第三次世界大战会比希特勒灾祸少些？
    今天是美国的国庆日。一七七六年七月四日美国人民制服了把他们当作奴隶的那些人们，并建立了他们的独立共和国。就在这一天，我向你们，美国的公民们号召，记着曾经鼓舞过你们最早的祖先的理想吧，让你们负责的领袖们放弃“吹牛和恐吓”，和苏联的代表以及其他大国的代表们共聚一堂，老老实实地设法取得协议。那样，你们将会拯救你们的国家，你们的孩子，你们的前途。今年年底将召开一个伟大的和平大会，这个大会代表所有人民的崇高愿望。让美国人民了解这个大会的重要性，并派遣一个能传达每一阶级和每一党派的意志的代表团。我只想说明，他们在苏联代表团的代表中是会发现朋友的，这些朋友能够尊重各民族不同的道路，不想强迫别人接受他们的生活方式，而是要拯救全人类的生命、文化和前途。
