    Fully Utilize Existing Water Conservancy Facilities
    The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's instruction on drought prevention and resistance issued this spring has played a huge role in mobilization and organization. Party organizations and people's governments at all levels have led the broad masses of peasants in digging wells, opening canals, repairing ponds, and building dams, and the achievements are unprecedented. Many of these water conservancy facilities have played a significant role in spring sowing and wheat field irrigation. However, the role of some paddy field facilities has not been well-utilized. In North China and Henan provinces, many farmers have not yet developed the habit of watering the land. Some farmers only use well water to irrigate vegetable gardens, not other fields; some farmers believe that watering is useless; some farmers find watering troublesome, and even after digging wells, they still wait for rain and are unwilling to water the land. In some places, canals have been opened, but because of insufficient water sources, water has not yet been released, and some farmers are waiting for the canals to release water, but they do not use the existing wells to water the land. In the Yellow River irrigation area, some farmers do not believe that the Yellow River water can irrigate the land; they are afraid that the Yellow River water contains too much sand and will damage the land. In some places in Hunan, ponds have been built, but no attention is paid to water storage; some ponds constantly leak, and some ponds have become dry ponds. In some villages in the Xing'an League of Inner Mongolia, because there was no shortage of rain this spring, they even filled in the wells that had been dug. In many areas, because leading cadres have adopted coercive commands, formalism, and a pursuit of numbers in drought prevention and resistance work, many wells that have been dug do not produce water or the water is too shallow, and must be re-dug or deepened. In some places, because the work of supply and marketing cooperatives has not been done well, some waterwheels have not yet been loaned to farmers, and some wells are still waiting for waterwheels. In some places, canals and ponds cannot fully exert their effectiveness due to unreasonable water use systems and imperfect management organizations.
    At present, many areas are suffering from drought. In order to do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, all localities should continue to build water conservancy projects and develop water sources, but there is a more urgent task, which is to fully utilize existing water conservancy facilities and maximize their effectiveness. To achieve this, first of all, it is necessary to carry out full ideological mobilization among the masses, improve the enthusiasm of the peasant masses to love the country and increase production, strengthen their confidence in winning the struggle against nature, and use facts to break the doubts of some farmers about the drought prevention and resistance movement. At the same time, it is necessary to earnestly change the coercive command and formalistic ideological styles of some cadres; to establish and improve democratic management institutions and systems for water conservancy facilities; and to do a good job in the supply of waterwheels and other water extraction tools. Only in this way can the large-scale development of water conservancy have practical significance.

    把已有的水利设施充分地利用起来
    中央人民政府政务院在今年春季发布的关于防旱抗旱的指示，已经发挥了巨大的动员和组织作用。各地党的组织和人民政府，领导广大农民，打井、开渠、修塘、筑坝，其成绩之大是史无先例的。这些水利设施，有许多在春季播种和麦田灌溉中，起了很大的作用。但是，还有一部分水田设施的作用，还没有很好地发挥出来。在华北各地和河南等省，不少农民还没有树立浇地的习惯。有些农民只用井水浇菜园子地，不浇其他田地；有些农民认为浇水是不顶用的；有些农民嫌浇水麻烦，打了井仍然等着下雨，不愿浇地。有些地方开了渠道，但因为水源不足，还未放水，有些农民一心等待渠道放水，但不用已有的水井浇地。引黄灌溉区有些农民，不相信黄河水能浇地，他们害怕黄河水含砂多，把地浇坏了。湖南有些地方修了水塘，但不注意蓄水，有些塘不断漏水，有些塘成了干塘。内蒙兴安盟部分村屯因为今春雨水不缺，竟把已打好的水井填平了。有许多地区，因为领导干部在防旱抗旱工作中发生了强迫命令、形式主义、追求数字的作风，打的许多井不出水或水太浅，必须另打或深锥。还有一些地方，由于供销合作社的工作没有做好，有些水车至今没有贷到农民手中，有些水井还在等待水车。有些地方的渠道和水塘，因为用水的制度不合理、管理机构不健全，也不能充分地发挥效力。
    目前许多地区已患干旱，为了作好防旱抗旱工作，各地应该继续兴修水利，开发水源，但有一个更加迫切的任务，就是必须把已有的水利设施，充分地利用起来，使它们发挥最大的效用。要做到这一点，首先要在群众中进行充分的思想动员工作，提高农民群众爱国增产的积极性，坚定他们和自然作斗争的胜利信心，用事实打破有些农民对防旱抗旱运动的疑虑。同时，要切实改变某些干部的强迫命令、形式主义的思想作风；要建立和健全民主管理水利设施的机构和制度；要做好水车和其他汲水用具的供应工作。只有这样，大量开发水利才有实际的意义。
