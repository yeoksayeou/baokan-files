    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Loves "Compressed Biscuits"
    Recently we received "compressed biscuits" sent from the motherland. The biscuits contain sesame seeds, sugar, and dried beef. They taste like pastries, fragrant and sweet. Two pieces are enough to fill you up. When we chew on these fragrant and sweet biscuits on the front lines, we are reminded of the care from the people of the motherland; this deep love is sweeter than the taste of the biscuits.
    Not only that, but the people of the motherland were even more considerate when manufacturing the small iron boxes for holding the biscuits. The boxes are made square, not too big and not too small, with handles on both sides and the lid, making them very convenient to carry. After the biscuits are eaten, they can be used to hold rice, hold water, as a washbasin, to boil water, cook rice, and make dumplings – they are absolutely excellent. Even when used to store documents and newspapers, they won't get damp in the air-raid shelter. They are truly versatile treasure chests! In the past, we also used oil drums, fried flour boxes, and artillery shells to make a lot of furniture such as pots, shovels, spoons, and basins, but they are never as convenient to use as these small iron boxes.
    The love and care of the people of the motherland for us is so intimate, that they think of even such small things so thoroughly. We have only one sentence to thank the people of the motherland: "Resolutely strike at the American aggressors and strive for the early realization of world peace!"

    志愿军热爱“压缩饼干”
    最近我们收到了从祖国运来的“压缩饼干”，饼干里夹着芝麻、砂糖和牛肉干，味道和点心一样，又香又甜，两块就可以吃饱。当我们在阵地上嚼着这又香又甜的饼干时，便想起祖国人民对我们的关怀；这深切的爱，比饼干的味道更要甜。
    不光这样，祖国人民在制造盛饼干的小铁箱时，想得更为周到。箱子做得四四方方的，不大也不小，两边和盖上都有提手，搬运很方便。饼干吃完后，用它盛饭、盛水、当洗脸盆、烧开水、做饭、煮饺子，都是顶呱呱的。就是用来装文件、装书报，放在防空洞里也潮湿不了，真是万能的百宝箱！过去，我们也利用油筒、炒面箱子、炮弹壳制造了不少的锅、铲、勺、盆等家具，但用起来总没有这小铁箱子方便。
    祖国人民对我们的热爱和关怀是这么样亲切，就连这一点小事情也想得周周到到，我们也只有一句话来答谢祖国人民：“狠狠打击美国侵略者，争取世界和平的早日实现！”　　志愿军　赵春
