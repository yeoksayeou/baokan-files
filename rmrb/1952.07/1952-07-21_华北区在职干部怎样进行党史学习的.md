The study of the history of the Chinese Communist Party has begun among cadres in the North China region. This study has been undertaken after a period of ideological and organizational preparation. North China already has more than three years of experience in organizing cadres to study theory, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have stimulated the enthusiasm of the vast majority of cadres to study theory. Therefore, this year it has been decided to systematically study the history of the Chinese Communist Party in order to learn from Chairman Mao's works and Mao Zedong Thought, with Mao Zedong's theories on the Chinese bourgeoisie and on China's New Democratic economic construction as the current focal points. The vast majority of cadres have warmly supported this approach and have shown great enthusiasm and initiative in their studies. Senior cadres have also participated in this study without exception. Many provincial Party secretaries personally lead senior study groups, guiding the study of ordinary comrades with their own learning. In order to promote the study movement throughout the region, local areas have widely established theoretical instructors and study tutors. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 2,000 theoretical instructors and more than 4,000 study tutors in the region. Most provinces also have full-time instructors. It can be said that we have already begun to organize a huge education network for cadres, laying a good foundation for future theoretical study. Today, the most important thing is how to strengthen study guidance. Here are some experiences from various places in North China in leading the study of Party history:

   I. It is imperative to clarify that the purpose of studying Party history is to deeply understand Mao Zedong Thought. Because simply studying the historical knowledge of the Party, without focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works, without deeply understanding Mao Zedong Thought, and without understanding the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods with which Comrade Mao Zedong solved practical problems of the revolution in various periods, it is impossible to truly understand the Party's great, glorious, and correct history. According to the experience of the Party history instructor training classes held by the North China Bureau and various provinces, it is easy to get everyone to acknowledge this approach, but in its implementation, it is constantly met with various unconscious resistance and obstacles. If the leadership relaxes even slightly, deviations will occur. For example, some comrades do not study to understand Mao Zedong Thought and study how Comrade Mao Zedong consistently adhered to the correct line and policies in order to clarify certain necessary historical situations; instead, they harbor the motive of searching for rare news, and are reluctant to part with many unimportant or unreliable, voluminous materials. Some comrades do not connect with their own ideological reality and do not try to understand Mao Zedong Thought well to criticize various erroneous ideas, and therefore cannot gain strength from Party history. We should understand that the process of studying Mao Zedong Thought and Party history is the process of improving and transforming our own thinking. Anyone who holds incorrect learning attitudes and ideological sentiments will not be able to truly learn Mao Zedong Thought well. At the beginning of the study, the existence of certain incorrect learning attitudes and ideological sentiments is very natural (which is precisely where our thinking needs to be transformed). Therefore, the leadership must carry out a series of educational and organizational work: such as repeatedly and specifically explaining our approach based on the ideological situation of the cadres, criticizing incorrect learning attitudes; requiring instructors to give serious and honest explanations, opposing irresponsible remarks and sensationalism; formulating study outlines, clarifying that the learning requirement is to focus on studying Chairman Mao's works, opposing the search for unnecessary and excessive reference materials, and preventing the study of trivial issues unrelated to policies. In the study, attention should be paid to linking with one's own ideological reality, and inspections and self-criticisms should be conducted when necessary. In order to ensure the seriousness and correctness of the learning attitude, it is also necessary to combine learning with strict organizational life. Only in this way can our approach be successfully implemented.

   II. Give play to the leading role of senior cadres in learning. Senior cadres are leading cadres of the Party, and the main responsibility for improving the Party's theoretical level and promoting theoretical study throughout the Party should be borne by them. Of course, the work of senior cadres is heavy, and there is no need or should they be required to abide by certain study system regulations in the same way as ordinary comrades in terms of learning methods, but this cannot be used as a reason for any senior cadre not to study. On the contrary, they must have a higher degree of conscious learning spirit, have better academic performance, and have the responsibility to guide others in learning. In the past, some places stipulated that senior cadres regularly report their learning situation and experiences to the Party committee, which played a certain role in urging them, but the shortcoming was that it did not effectively guide the learning of ordinary cadres. Recently, Pingyuan, Hebei, and other places have been implementing the method of holding regular learning symposiums for senior cadres to introduce their own learning situations and experiences, which has proven to be a better leadership style. This kind of symposium can not only urge senior cadres to study, allowing senior cadres to have more systematic opportunities to exchange learning experiences and opinions with others, but also introduce and promote the learning of ordinary comrades. In the past few years, the shortcomings of leading the study were that there were only calls for mobilization, lacking regular organizational leadership, which often caused the study movement to be lively for a while and then flow away by itself. From the beginning of this study movement, this phenomenon should no longer be repeated. Senior cadres should first persevere in learning, adhere to regular symposiums and other reasonable study systems, so that they can constantly improve themselves and also help improve all cadres.

   III. Continue to cultivate theoretical instructors. At present, most of the confirmed theoretical instructors, except for a few leading cadres, have not conducted systematic studies of Party history and Mao Zedong Thought. Very few have been trained through Party history instructor training classes, and the theoretical level of most instructors is not high. Therefore, today, they should not be subject to unrealistically high demands that are divorced from reality, and even less should they be required to correctly apply theory to solve all practical work problems at any time. As long as they can correctly explain certain issues in Party history and are responsible for finding ways to answer the difficulties raised by everyone, they should be considered good instructors and should be encouraged. At present, earnestly cultivating theoretical instructors is still a serious task. Although a group of theoretical instructors has been trained in various places before the study, and great achievements have been made, both in terms of quality and quantity, it is still far from meeting the requirements of the study and must be continuously trained. The theoretical instructor research class organized by Tianjin City and the theoretical instructor spare-time lecture class held in Beijing, which allow instructors to conduct spare-time study while guiding others to study, can be fully implemented in cities. In addition, in the cadre study in various places, such as when Shanxi Province tentatively set up theoretical instructors in the provincial Party committee's directly affiliated organs and Taiyuan City last year, the method of having consultants give preparation lessons to instructors was adopted; the Propaganda Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee established a research group specifically to study learning guidance issues; and Hebei Province stipulated that senior cadres should participate in learning guidance work, etc., these are all effective methods. The Propaganda Department of the Party committee should think of all possible ways, such as: regularly convening instructor meetings, formulating lecture plans, study outlines, and guidance programs, etc., to give instructors specific help. In addition, it can also organize instructors for collective research and enable senior groups to truly play the role of learning consultants.

    华北区在职干部怎样进行党史学习的
    葛震
    华北全区在职干部的中共党史的学习已经开始了。这次学习是经过了一定的思想准备和组织准备的，华北过去已有过三年多组织在职干部学习理论的经验，“三反”“五反”运动又激发了广大干部学习理论的热情，因此今年确定通过学习中共党史以系统地学习毛主席的著作，学习毛泽东思想，并暂以毛泽东同志关于中国资产阶级的学说和关于中国新民主主义经济建设理论作为学习重点。广大干部都热烈拥护这一方针，在学习中表现了极大热情与自觉。高级干部也无例外地参加了这一学习，很多省委书记并亲自领导高级组，以自己的学习指导
    一般同志的学习。为推动全区的学习运动，各地普遍设立了理论教员与学习辅导员。据目前不完全统计，全区已有理论教员二千余人，学习辅导员四千人以上。多数省份还有专职教员。可以说，我们已为在职干部开始组织了一个巨大的教育网，为今后的理论学习准备了良好的基础。今天最主要的是如何加强学习指导的问题了。这是华北各地领导党史学习的几点经验：
    一、必须明确学习党史的目的在于深入体会毛泽东思想。因为单纯学习党的历史知识，而不着重研读毛主席著作，不深入领会毛泽东思想，领会毛泽东同志解决各个时期革命实际问题的立场、观点和方法，是不能真正了解党的伟大、光荣、正确的历史的。根据华北局和各省举办党史教员训练班的经验，使大家承认这一方针是容易的，但在贯彻中却不断遭到各种不自觉的抵抗和阻碍。领导的人稍一放松，就会发生偏差。比如有的同志在学习中不是为了领会毛泽东思想，研究毛泽东同志如何一贯坚持了正确的方针路线来弄清某些必要的历史情况；而是抱着搜寻珍闻的动机，对很多不关紧要或毫不可靠的庞杂资料恋恋不舍。有的同志不和自己的思想实际相联系，不去很好领会毛泽东思想，批判各种错误思想，因此不能使自己从党史中获得力量。我们应该了解，学习毛泽东思想和党史的过程，就是提高和改造自己思想的过程，凡抱有不正确的学习态度和思想情绪，都不可能真正学好毛泽东思想。在学习之初，某些不正确的学习态度和思想情绪的存在是很自然的（这也正是我们思想需要改造的地方），因此，领导方面就必须进行一系列的教育工作和组织工作：如根据干部思想情况，反复地具体地解释我们的方针，批判不正确的学习态度；要求教员进行严肃地老实地讲解，反对信口开河，哗众取宠；制定学习要点，明确学习要求在于着重学习毛主席著作，反对搜寻不必要的过多的参考材料，并防止钻研某些与方针政策无关的琐碎问题。在学习中应注意联系自己思想实际，必要时进行检查与检讨。为了保证学习态度的严肃、端正，还必须使学习与严格的组织生活相结合，只有这样，才能顺利地贯彻我们的方针。
    二、发挥高级干部在学习中的领导作用。高级干部是党的领导干部，提高党的理论水平、推动全党理论学习的主要责任应由他们来担负。当然，高级干部的工作是繁重的，在学习方式上无必要也不应该要求他们和一般同志一样遵守某些学习制度的规定，但这也不能作为任何高级干部不学习的理由，相反地，他们必须有更高度的自觉的学习精神，有更好的学习成绩，并有责任指导别人学习。有的地方过去曾规定高级干部定期向党委报告自己学习的情况与心得的制度，曾起过一定的督促作用，但缺点是没有有力地指导一般干部的学习。最近平原、河北等地已在实行定期召开高级干部学习座谈会，以介绍自己学习情况与经验的办法，证明是较好的领导方式。这种座谈会既可督促高级干部学习，使高级干部自己有较系统的与别人交换学习心得和意见的机会，同时又可介绍出去启发与推动一般同志的学习。过去几年中领导学习的缺点是只有号召动员，缺乏经常的组织领导，因之往往使学习运动热闹一阵就自流下去了。从这次学习运动开始，应该不再重复这一现象。高级干部应首先坚持不懈地学习下去，坚持定期座谈和其他合理的学习制度，这样才能不断提高自己，也有助于提高全体干部。
    三、继续培养理论教员。目前已确定的理论教员，除一部分领导干部外，多数同志对党史和毛泽东思想并没有进行过系统学习，经过党史教员训练班训练的也很少，多数教员的理论水平是不高的。因此今天对他们不应有脱离实际的过高的要求，更不能要求他们随时都能正确地应用理论来解决一切实际工作问题，只要他们能正确地讲解党史中的某些问题，并对大家提出的疑难负责设法解答，就应认为是好教员，应当加以鼓励。目前认真培养理论教员还是一个严重任务。虽然在学习之前各地都训练了一部分理论教员，都有很大成绩，但无论从质与量来说，都还远不能满足学习的要求，必须继续加以训练。天津市所组织的理论教员研究班，北京所举办的理论教员业余讲习班，使教员一面进行业余学习；一面指导别人学习，这个办法在城市中完全可以实行。另外，在各地干部学习中，如山西省去年在省委直属机关与太原市试设理论教员时，曾采取由顾问给教员上准备课的办法；平原省委宣传部成立研究组专门研究学习指导问题；河北省规定高级干部要参加学习指导工作等，这些都是有效的办法。党委宣传部应该想一切可能的办法，如：定期召开教员会议，制定讲授计划、学习要点及辅导方案等，给教员以具体帮助。此外，还可以组织教员集体研究，并使高级组真正起到学习顾问的作用。
