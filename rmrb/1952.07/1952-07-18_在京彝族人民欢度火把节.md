Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: More than forty Yi people in Beijing celebrated their Torch Festival (calculated according to the Yi calendar) on the 15th of this month, all gathering at the Summer Palace. Many of them specially donned their ethnic costumes - felt cloaks. They held a grand recreational gathering in the Summer Palace, preceded by a discussion.

During the recreational gathering, they sang, danced, and played games, performing many Yi recreational programs. They sang a long song widely circulated among the Yi people called "Ayi Azhi." This song tells the moving story of a Yi woman named Ayi Azhi who, according to legend, could not bear the abuse of her parents-in-law and escaped from the old-fashioned family. After the recreational gathering, a potluck dinner was held. While drinking, they followed their ethnic customs, occasionally letting out long whistles, echoing among the gardens and mountains, making the potluck dinner even more lively and enthusiastic.

The Torch Festival is the most important festival of the Yi people. Its grandeur is equivalent to the Han people's New Year. On this day, the Yi people of both Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains, regardless of gender, burn torches at night and hold gatherings. In terms of agricultural production, it has the meaning of raising fire to kill insects.

    在京彝族人民欢度火把节
    【新华社十七日讯】本月十五日是彝族的火把节日（依彝族历法计算），在京彝族四十多人在这一天齐赴颐和园欢度自己的节日，不少人特别换上了自己的民族服装——披毡。他们在颐和园举行了盛大的游艺会，会前并举行座谈。
    在游艺会进行当中，他们唱歌、跳舞、做游戏，表演了许多彝族的游艺节目。他们唱了在彝族中流传很广的一支叫做“阿依阿芝”的长歌，这支歌叙述了传说中的一个彝族妇女阿依阿芝不堪翁姑虐待，逃出旧式家庭的动人的故事。游艺会结束后，并举行聚餐。饮酒的时候，他们依照本民族的习惯，不时发出长啸，回响园林山水之间，使聚餐进行得更加生动、热烈。
    按火把节，是彝族的最大节日，其隆重情况，相当于汉族的年节。在这一天，大、小凉山的彝族，不论男女，入夜都燃烧火把，举行集会，对农业生产来说，有举火杀虫的意思。
