Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 28th – The "United Nations Command" in Tokyo unilaterally released a "summary" of the meeting records on the 26th, attempting to distort the meeting's discussions and conceal the US side's deceptive behavior. However, the undeniable facts cannot be obscured by any lies. The following are some of the deceptive tactics employed by US representative Harriman during and around the eighteen days of administrative meetings:

On July 1st, Harriman stated that the POW issue, "if there is to be a solution, it must be one that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides." However, in the ensuing administrative meetings, Harriman consistently adhered to the US side's unilateral insistence on detaining POWs. He unreasonably stated: "Any concession made by either party that contributes to achieving an armistice must be consistent with our principle of no forced repatriation." He further unreasonably said: "If an armistice is to be achieved, it must fully preserve the UN Command's position on the principle of no forced repatriation of prisoners of war." In other words, if they are not allowed to arbitrarily detain POWs, they will not agree to an armistice. He repeatedly stated that their position on detaining POWs was so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable." This is Harriman's so-called solution that "reasonably meets the requirements of both sides," but actually only meets the unilateral demands of the other side.

On July 1st, Harriman also explicitly put forward Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement as a common basis for both sides to resolve the POW issue. This article stipulates: "All prisoners of war held by each side at the time of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible." However, in the administrative meetings, Harriman attempted to overturn the principles stipulated in this article through various clumsy deceptive means. He expressed his intention to make "administrative changes" to the "names and categories" of our captured personnel. He fabricated the idea that there was a "great difference" between the terms "prisoner of war" and "captured personnel." He cunningly claimed that some POWs should be classified as "deserters" and not repatriated… In reality, Harriman's trick was to add a name other than "prisoner of war" to a large number of our captured personnel, so that the US side could unilaterally handle them as they pleased and arbitrarily detain them. The remaining portion would then be "fully repatriated" in accordance with Article 51! Even more absurdly, Harriman suggested falsely including the POWs that the US side wanted to detain on the repatriation list, but in reality, they would not be repatriated. These childish tricks are Harriman's so-called "solutions" that the US side could "consider."

After General Nam Il pointed out that "any trickery with names or terminology cannot solve the problem," Harriman simply tore up the principles of Article 51 that he had proposed himself and put forward the absurd figure of only repatriating 83,000 of our captured personnel. This means that the US side wants to detain 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs and 20 percent of the Korean People's Army POWs. Obviously, this is fundamentally incompatible with the Geneva Convention, which stipulates the repatriation of all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities.

On July 1st, Harriman also said: "We sincerely seek an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea." He even explicitly said: "We do have a reasonable basis for reaching an armistice agreement." However, after Harriman brazenly overturned the "reasonable basis" for negotiations and proposed the absurd figure of 83,000, he completely refused any further discussion. In consecutive administrative meetings, he only repeated the same old line, "I have nothing to say." This is Harriman's way of "sincerely seeking an armistice."

On the other hand, our side made significant efforts during the eighteen days of administrative meetings. General Nam Il first proposed reclassifying and recorrecting the lists of POWs according to nationality and original residence, based on Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by both sides, to arrive at a solution that truly "reasonably meets the requirements of both sides." General Nam Il later repeatedly specifically pointed out that as long as the US side recorrected the lists and put forward a realistic figure close to 116,000, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs, the POW issue could be resolved and an armistice could be achieved. However, Harriman not only refused to discuss our reasonable plan, but unilaterally demanded: "How do your suggestions intend to meet the needs of our principle of repatriation?"

When our side suggested ending the administrative meetings on the 25th, Harriman initially opposed General Nam Il's suggestion to hold staff meetings to agree on certain textual details of the draft agreement. He believed that agreeing on the textual details of the draft agreement was useless until an agreement was reached on the basic terms regarding the repatriation of POWs. However, outside the meeting tent, Harriman did not dare to tell the reporters that he opposed holding staff meetings. He lied to them, saying that General Nam Il wanted the staff meetings to "draft a new draft armistice agreement." This is also one of Harriman's manifestations of his guilty conscience.

The records of the administrative meetings prove that Harriman spoke of "sincerely seeking an armistice" but was actually following Washington's instructions to do everything possible to block the path to resolving the problem. When the administrative meetings were declared over on the 25th, a guilty-conscience-ridden Harriman told reporters: "All the details of the UN Command's attempts to resolve the POW issue over the past three weeks will not be published to the free world's press." He thought that this would cover up all the US side's tricks to obstruct the armistice. Then, in order to escape the world's people's attention to their hypocritical face, Harriman hastily fled the meeting tent halfway through the first public meeting that resumed on the 26th, regardless of the fact that our side wanted to continue speaking.

However, Major General Harriman's escape is in vain. Unless the US side publicly declares the negotiations broken, he will still have to face the fact that the US side's claim to arbitrarily detain POWs is a complete violation of the universally recognized Geneva Convention, and is therefore unacceptable to the people of the world. The POW issue must be resolved fairly and reasonably in accordance with the Geneva Convention. All deceptive and blackmailing tactics by the US side to detain POWs will continue to be shamefully bankrupted.

### 哈利逊在行政性会议期间玩弄欺诈手段  暴露美方扣留战俘的骗局

    哈利逊在行政性会议期间玩弄欺诈手段
    暴露美方扣留战俘的骗局
    【新华社开城二十八日电】在东京的“联合国军司令部”在二十六日片面发表会议纪录的“摘要”，竭力歪曲会议讨论的过程，企图掩盖美方在会议中的种种欺诈行为。但是，铁的事实是任何谎言都无法掩盖的。下面就是美方代表哈利逊在十八天的行政性会议期间及会议前后所采取的种种欺诈手段的一部分：
    七月一日，哈利逊曾说战俘问题“如果要有解决方案的话，它必须是一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”。但是在接着召开的行政性会议上，哈利逊却始终坚持美方扣留战俘的片面主张。他曾无理地说：“任何一方所作的能有助于达成停战的任何让步，必须与我方不得强迫遣返的原则相协调。”他并曾更加无理地说：“假使停战能达成的话，它必须完整地保存联合国军在不强迫遣返战俘原则上的立场。”换句话说，如果不许他们任意扣留战俘，他们就不停战。他更不止一次地重复说他们的扣留战俘的立场是所谓“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”。这就是哈利逊所谓“在合理程度上适合双方要求”而实际上是只能适合对方片面要求的解决方法。
    七月一日，哈利逊又曾明确提出停战协定草案第五十一款，作为双方解决战俘问题的共同基础。这一款规定：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。”但是在行政性会议上，哈利逊却企图用种种拙劣的欺骗手法，来推翻这一款所规定的原则。他表示要对我方被俘人员作“名称及种类”的“行政上的改变”。他杜撰说，在“战俘”及“被俘人员”两个名词之间有“很大的差别”，他诡称战俘中有些应被分类为“逃兵”而不予遣返……实际上，哈利逊的花枪就是要给大批我方被俘人员加上一个“战俘”之外的其它名称，这样就可以听任美方片面处理，恣意扣留；扣剩的部分，再按第五十一款“全部遣返”！更荒唐的是哈利逊竟曾建议把美方要扣留的战俘，也虚假地列入遣返的名单内，但实际上却不予遣返。这些幼稚的骗术就是哈利逊的所谓美方可以“考虑”的“解决方案”。
    在南日将军指出“任何在名称或名词上耍花样的办法都不能解决问题”之后，哈利逊索性公然撕毁他自己提出的第五十一款原则，提出只遣返我方八万三千名被俘人员的荒谬数字。这就是说：美方要扣留百分之六十八的志愿军战俘，百分之二十的人民军战俘。显然，这与规定敌对行为停止后遣返全部战俘的日内瓦公约是水火不相容的。
    七月一日，哈利逊又曾说：“我们诚意觅求停战，以终止在朝鲜的流血。”他更明确地说：“我们的确有着达成停战协议的合理基础。”但是，哈利逊在悍然推翻了谈判的“合理基础”而提出八万三千的荒唐数字以后，就根本拒绝任何进一步的讨论。连续许多天的行政性会议上，他只重复一句老话，“我无话可说。”这就是哈利逊“诚意觅求停战”的办法。
    另一方面，我方在十八天的行政性会议中，作了重大的努力。南日将军首先提出根据双方同意的停战协定草案第五十一、五十二款，按国籍及原住地区把战俘重新分类，重行校正名单，以得出真正“在合理程度上适合双方要求”的解决。南日将军后来更历次具体指出：只要美方重行校正名单后，提出一个接近十一万六千，包括二万名志愿军被俘人员的切合实际的数字，遣俘问题即可解决，停战即可达成。但是哈利逊不但拒绝讨论我方的合理方案，反而片面地要求：“你们的建议打算如何满足我方遣俘原则的需要？”
    当我方在二十五日建议终止行政性会议时，哈利逊最初是反对南日将军提出的举行参谋会议以商定协定草案的若干文字细节的建议的。他认为在有关战俘遣返问题的基本条款上没有取得协议之前，商定协定草案的文字细节是没有用处的。可是在会议帐篷外面，哈利逊却不敢把他反对举行参谋会议这件事告诉记者们，他骗他们说，南日将军要参谋会议“制订一个停战协定的新草案”。这也是哈利逊贼胆心虚的表现之一。
    行政性会议的纪录证明：哈利逊嘴里讲“诚意觅求停战”，实际上却是奉着华盛顿的训令在竭力堵塞解决问题的途径。当行政性会议在二十五日宣告结束时，做贼心虚的哈利逊对记者说：“联合国军过去三周来试图解决战俘问题的全部细节，是不对自由世界的新闻界发表的。”他以为这样就可以遮盖住美方阻挠停战的种种诡计。接着，为了逃避世界人民对他们的虚伪面貌的注视，哈利逊在二十六日恢复的第一次公开会议上，就不顾我方还要继续发言，仓皇地中途逃出会议帐篷。
    但是，哈利逊少将的逃跑是徒然的。除非美方公开宣布谈判破裂，否则他还是不得不面对这样一个事实，那就是：美方任意扣留战俘的主张是完全违反举世公认的日内瓦公约的，因而也是全世界人民所不容许的。战俘问题必须按照日内瓦公约公平合理地解决，美方企图扣留战俘的一切欺骗讹诈伎俩，都将继续遭到可耻的破产。
