Strengthen Leadership of Reading Newspapers Among Government Staff
The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the past, our leadership of current affairs propaganda and newspaper reading focused more on workers and citizens, and less attention was paid to government cadres. We assumed that government cadres had a higher level of political awareness and would not neglect political and current affairs study, because they could not do their jobs well without reading newspapers. In fact, this was a misconception. Since the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column continuously exposed the phenomenon of some government staff in Beijing neglecting to read newspapers, we became alert. Therefore, in mid-May, we instructed the Party committees of various government departments and the propaganda departments of district committees to check on newspaper reading. During the checks, each unit also conducted a current affairs test on government staff as a key point.

The results of the checks on thirteen units of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government and ten units including the Organization Department and the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Security Bureau, the Fifth District Committee, the Second District Government, and the Eighth District Government, totaling twenty-eight government offices, are as follows:

The thirteen units of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government have a total of 7,772 staff members with reading ability, subscribing to 1,286 newspapers (an average of one newspaper for every six people). 1,943 people read newspapers regularly and carefully, accounting for 25%; 4,587 read newspapers carelessly (only looking at headlines or reading based on personal interests), accounting for 59%; and 1,242 rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all, accounting for 16%. The ten units including the Second District Government have a total of 845 people, of whom 837 have reading ability. 205 people read newspapers regularly and carefully, accounting for 24.5%; 468 read newspapers carelessly, accounting for 55.9%; and 164 rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all, accounting for 19.6%. According to the statistics of sixteen units including the department store companies affiliated to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, among financial and economic departments, there are 5,333 people with reading ability. 1,367 people read newspapers regularly and carefully, accounting for 25.8%; 2,568 read newspapers carelessly, accounting for 48.1%; and 1,398 rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all, accounting for 26.1%. The Cooperative Headquarters has 537 people with reading ability. 57 people read newspapers regularly and carefully, accounting for 10.6%; 290 read newspapers carelessly, accounting for 54%; and 190 rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all, accounting for 35.4%. Most of the staff members of the Organization Department and the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Fifth District Committee, and other government offices can read newspapers regularly. Among the 32 people in the Fifth District Committee, except for three (correspondents) who do not read newspapers regularly, everyone else reads newspapers regularly. The personnel of the Public Security Bureau generally read newspapers regularly as well. Judging from the above checks, the situation of neglecting to read newspapers is very serious in the financial and economic system (especially cooperatives), is also not good in general government offices, is relatively good in Party committee offices, but there are still individuals who neglect to read newspapers.

The results of this current affairs test show that, except for a few government offices with good results, the results of most government offices are not good. According to the statistical results of the tests conducted on nine units including the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Organization Department and the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Eighth District Government, and the Second District Government, as well as factory directors, Party branch secretaries, and some government officials in the Eighth District, among the 889 people who participated in the test, only 280 passed, accounting for 31.5%; and 609 failed, accounting for 68.5%. Among them, 58 people from the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee participated in the test, and 10 failed; 11 people from the United Front Work Department participated in the test, and 3 failed; 17 people from the Fifth District Committee participated in the test, and 4 failed. These are all relatively good results. In other government offices, the number of people who failed accounted for more than half. Among the 36 people from the Eighth District Government who participated in the test, only 12 passed. In the nine units of the Second District Committee, a total of 416 people participated in the test, and 322 failed, accounting for 77.4% of the total number of people. Among the 20 factory directors, Party branch secretaries, and some government officials in the Eighth District, only two passed, and the average score was 34.3. These people all have reading ability and can write reports (three with university education, four with senior high school education, six with junior high school education, and seven with higher primary school education), but the test results were unexpectedly failing.

Some more serious problems were also exposed in the answers. Many people did not know about the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference that had been published in the newspapers for several consecutive days. Regarding this question, 12 people from the Eighth District Government could not answer, and 12 of the 20 factory directors, Party branch secretaries, and some government officials in the Eighth District did not know about this event. Many people could not answer or did not answer completely about the basic principles of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. Four Party branch secretaries from the Eighth District could not answer, and a deputy section chief of the Second Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau and a cadre of the Trade Union Office of the Second District had worked as shop assistants during the "Five-Anti" movement, but they could not answer at all. The director of the Chongwenmenwai Office of the People's Bank answered "leniency for state-owned, strictness for private-owned" and answered the "five evils" as "raising prices" and "corroding state cadres". A cadre from the Industry and Commerce Section of the Eighth District Government answered "consolidating the economy". Among the 86 people in the Labor Bureau, 46 could not completely answer what the "five evils" were, and 7 of them who had been transferred to participate in the "Five-Anti" work (inspection team, etc.) could not answer completely either. Some people were also unclear about what the unresolved issues in the Korean armistice negotiations were, and some people thought it was the "neutral nations" issue and the "building airport" issue. One test question in the Labor Bureau was: "Which are the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe?" Among the 86 people, only 6 could answer completely, 30 did not know at all, and 14 answered extremely incorrectly. For example, a deputy section chief and a team leader answered Indonesia, Vietnam, North Korea, and Japan; a Party propagandist answered India, Sweden, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, etc.; and some answered China, Iran, Denmark, Belgium, Chile, etc.

The above situation shows that, in general, the phenomenon of neglecting to read newspapers and study current affairs policies is very serious among government staff in Beijing, except for a few departments that pay more attention to reading newspapers. The main reasons are:

(1) Some cadres neglect politics and have a purely professional or purely technical point of view. They do not connect their work with the entire domestic and international political situation and the Party and government's policies and guidelines. They even mistakenly believe that reading newspapers is contradictory to work. Many people often use the excuse of "being busy with work and having no time" to neglect reading newspapers, using not reading newspapers to show their work tension and complacently saying, "I'm so busy that I don't even read the newspapers."

(2) Some leading cadres, especially leading cadres of small units, do not care about the political life of the masses and lack political and ideological leadership in their work, existing with a purely professional point of view. They themselves rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all. For example, the director of the newly built Pottery General Factory usually does not read newspapers and does not participate in the test. Some units also subscribe to very few newspapers. The Trade Union Office of the Second District has 30 cadres, but only subscribes to 3 newspapers. Sometimes these three newspapers are all taken away by comrades who are working outside, and others cannot see them, and that's that.

(3) The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees of various government departments and the district committees have not paid enough attention to the current affairs study of government cadres, and have not regularly urged and checked.

After this check and test, the leaders of various units have generally paid attention to the seriousness of neglecting to read newspapers, and have established some systems to promote current affairs study and improve newspaper reading. According to the opinions put forward by various units, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee has formulated the following measures to improve the reading of newspapers by government staff in Beijing in the future:

(1) Combining this check and test, each government branch should convene a branch meeting (absorbing members of the Communist Youth League and the masses to participate), announce the results of the check and test at the meeting, and repeatedly carry out ideological mobilization, especially emphasizing the importance of reading newspapers, explaining that if our government staff, especially Party member cadres, do not pay attention to reading newspapers, do not care about the domestic and international political situation and the Party and government's policies and guidelines, they will be divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and unable to do their jobs well. At the meeting, concrete examples should be used to criticize and refute the idea of neglecting to read newspapers. It should be pointed out that failure to read newspapers and study current affairs policies will lead to serious mistakes in work. Reading newspapers should become an indispensable part of every cadre's daily political life.

(2) Make full use of government propagandists and strengthen leadership of the government propaganda network. One of the important tasks of government propagandists is to do a good job in current affairs study for government cadres.

(3) The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Party committees of various government departments, and the district committees should establish a current affairs report system in the future (once every two months for the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, and once a month for the Party committees of various government departments and the district committees). The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee should also regularly and selectively check the newspaper reading work of government offices. The Party committees of various government departments and the district committees should regularly check the newspaper reading situation of each branch, and regularly educate the heads of each government branch, explaining that caring about the newspaper reading situation of cadres is an important aspect of caring about the political life of cadres. Overcome the mistaken view of some comrades that government cadres do not need to be led to read newspapers.

(4) Fix the current affairs test system and hold a test once a month to improve the enthusiasm of government cadres in reading newspapers.

### 加强对机关工作人员读报工作的领导

    加强对机关工作人员读报工作的领导
    中共北京市委宣传部
    过去我们对时事宣传和读报工作的领导偏重在工人和市民方面，对机关干部注意不够。我们以为机关干部的政治觉悟较高，不会忽视政治、时事的学习，因为他们不看报就作不好工作。其实，这是一个错觉。自从人民日报读者来信栏连续揭发了北京市某些机关工作人员忽视读报的现象以后，我们才警觉起来，于是在五月中旬向各机关党委、各区区委宣传部布置了检查读报的工作。各单位在检查时，并有重点地对机关工作人员进行了一次时事测验。
    在市府各局处十三个单位和市委组织部、统战部、市总工会、公安局、五区区委会、二区区政府、八区区政府等十个单位共二十八个机关检查的结果如下：
    市府各局处十三个单位有阅读能力的工作人员共七千七百七十二人，订了一千二百八十六份报纸（平均六个人一份），经常认真读报的一千九百四十三人，占百分之二十五；读得草率的（只看大标题或从个人兴趣出发）四千五百八十七人，占百分之五十九；很少看报或根本不看报的一千二百四十二人，占百分之十六。二区区政府等十个单位共有八百四十五人，其中有阅读能力的八百三十七人，经常认真读报的二百零五人，占百分之二十四点五；读得草率的四百六十八人，占百分之五十五点九；很少看报或根本不看报的一百六十四人，占百分之十九点六。财经机关，根据工商局所属百货公司等十六个单位的统计，有阅读能力的共五千三百三十三人，经常认真读报的一千三百六十七人，占百分之二十五点八；读得草率的二千五百六十八人，占百分之四十八点一；很少看报或根本不看报的一千三百九十八人，占百分之二十六点一。合作总社有阅读能力的五百三十七人，经常认真读报的五十七人，占百分之十点六；读得草率的二百九十人，占百分之五十四；很少看报或根本不看报的一百九十人，占百分之三十五点四。市委组织部、统战部、五区区委会等机关工作人员绝大部分都能经常看报，五区区委会三十二人中，除三人（通讯员）不经常看报外，其他人都经常看报。公安局的人员一般也经常看报。由上述的检查情况看来，财经系统（特别是合作社）忽视读报的情况很严重，一般机关也很不好，党委机关比较好，但还有个别人忽视读报。
    这次时事测验的结果，除少数机关成绩较好外，多数机关的成绩是不好的。根据市府文教局、市委组织部、统战部、市总工会、八区区政府、二区区政府等九个单位及八区各工厂厂长、党支部书记和部分机关负责人的测验结果统计，参加测验的八百八十九人中，及格的仅二百八十人，占百分之三十一点五；不及格的六百零九人，占百分之六十八点五。其中市委组织部参加测验的五十八人中，不及格的十人；统战部参加测验的十一人，不及格的三人；五区区委会参加测验的十七人，不及格的四人，这都是成绩较好的。其他机关不及格的均占半数以上。八区区政府参加测验的三十六人中，及格的只有十二人。二区区委会九个单位，参加测验的共四百一十六人，不及格的有三百二十二人，占总人数的百分之七十七点四。八区各工厂厂长、党支部书记和部分机关负责人二十人中，只有两人及格，平均分数是三十四点三。这些人都有阅读能力，并能写报告（大学程度的三人、高中程度的四人、初中程度的六人、高小程度的七人），测验结果，竟不及格。
    从答题中也暴露出一些比较严重的问题。有许多人不知道报上曾连续登载过的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议。对于这个问题，八区区政府有十二人答不出，八区各工厂厂长、党支部书记和部分机关负责人二十人中，有十二人不知道有这件事情。市人民政府劳动局有十二人答为“国际经济会议”。关于惩治贪污条例的基本原则，很多人答不出或答不完全。八区有四个工厂的党支部书记答不出来，公安内二分局一个副科长及二区工会办事处一个干部，都曾在“五反”运动中作过店员工作，竟一点都答不出。人民银行崇文门外办事处主任答为“国营从宽、私营从严”，并将“五毒”答成“抬高物价”，“腐蚀国家干部”。八区区政府工商科一个干部答为“巩固经济”。劳动局八十六人中，有四十六人不能完全答出何谓“五毒”，其中曾有被调出参加“五反”工作（检查组等）的七人也答不完全。还有些人弄不清朝鲜停战谈判尚未解决的问题是什么，有些人以为是“中立国”问题和“修建机场”问题。劳动局有一个测验题目是：“东欧有那几个人民民主国家？”在八十六人中只有六人能完全答出，三十个人完全不知道，其中十四人答得极其错误。例如一科副科长和一个组长竟答成印尼、越南、朝鲜、日本；一个党的宣传员竟答成印度、瑞典、荷兰、南斯拉夫等；还有的答中国、伊朗、丹麦、比利时、智利等。
    以上的情况说明，北京市的机关工作人员，除少数部门比较注意读报外，一般来讲，忽视读报和时事政策学习的现象是很严重的，其原因主要是：
    （一）某些干部忽视政治，有单纯业务观点和单纯技术观点。他们没有把工作和整个国内外政治形势、党和政府的方针政策联系起来，甚至错误地认为读报和工作有矛盾。很多人常藉口“工作忙，没有时间”而忽视读报，以不读报来表现他的工作紧张，还沾沾自喜地说：“忙得我连报也不看。”
    （二）某些领导干部，特别是小单位的领导干部不关心群众的政治生活，工作中缺乏政治思想领导，存在着单纯业务观点。他们自己就很少看报或不看报。例如新建窑业总厂厂长平时不看报，也不参加测验。还有些单位订的报纸很少，二区工会办事处有三十个干部，只订了三份报纸。有时这三份报纸全被出外工作的同志带走，其他人看不到，也就算了。
    （三）市委宣传部和各机关党委、各区区委对机关干部的时事学习注意得不够，没有经常督促和检查。
    经过这次的检查和测验，各单位领导方面对忽视读报的严重性已普遍注意，并已经建立了一些推动时事学习的制度和改进读报工作的办法。市委宣传部根据各单位所提出的意见，订出今后改进北京市的机关工作人员读报的办法如下：
    （一）结合这次检查、测验，各机关支部要召集一次支部大会（吸收团员和群众参加），在会上公布检查、测验的结果，并反复进行思想动员，特别着重说明读报的重要，说明如果我们机关工作人员，特别是党员干部，不注意阅读报纸，不关心国内外的政治形势和党与政府的方针政策，就会脱离政治、脱离群众，不能做好工作。在会上要用具体实例对忽视读报的思想加以批评和驳斥。要指出：不看报、不学习时事政策，在工作上就会犯严重的错误。要使读报成为每个干部日常政治生活中不可缺少的事情。
    （二）充分使用机关宣传员，加强对机关宣传网的领导。确定机关宣传员的重要任务之一，是把机关干部的时事学习作好。
    （三）市委宣传部、各机关党委、区委今后要建立起时事报告制度（市委宣传部两月一次，各机关党委、区委每月一次），市委宣传部并要经常有重点地抽查机关的读报工作。各机关党委、区委要经常检查各支部的读报情况，并经常教育各机关支部负责人，说明关心干部的读报状况是关心干部政治生活的一个重要方面。克服有些同志片面地认为机关干部用不着去领导他们读报的错误看法。
    （四）把时事测验制度固定起来，每月举行测验一次，以提高机关干部的读报积极性。
