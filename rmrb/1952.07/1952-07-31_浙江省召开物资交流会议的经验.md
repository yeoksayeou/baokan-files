The Zhejiang Province Convenes Material Exchange Conference: Experiences

Following the East China Region's Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference, most counties and cities in Zhejiang Province also held exchange conferences one after another. Preliminary results have been achieved in material exchange work. Statistics from late May to the end of June show that transactions worth 285.9 billion yuan were concluded at the East China Region's Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference, 71.3 billion yuan at the Zhejiang Province Material Exchange Conference, and 121.5 billion yuan at the exchange conferences in two special districts and 38 counties and cities. Major local products of the province (such as soybeans, Mao bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, ginger, and cultural paper) have changed from slow-selling to fast-selling, and slow-selling commodities accounted for 27.53 percent of the total transaction volume. At the same time, industrial products were organized to go to the countryside, appropriately solving the backlog of urban industrial products. Industrial products accounted for 29 percent of the commodities traded at the province, special district, county, and city exchange conferences. The exchange conferences at all levels specifically embodied the policy of encouraging legitimate operation of private enterprises and improved the enthusiasm of private merchants. The proportion of transactions at the provincial exchange conference was: state-owned economy accounted for 35 percent, cooperatives accounted for 25 percent, and private merchants accounted for 40 percent. The average proportion of exchange conferences at the special district, county, and city levels was: in terms of purchases: state-owned economy accounted for 26 percent, cooperatives accounted for 17 percent, and private merchants accounted for 57 percent; in terms of sales: state-owned economy accounted for 26.5 percent, cooperatives accounted for 31.07 percent, and private merchants accounted for 42.43 percent. The material exchange conferences in special districts, counties, and cities, except for a few counties that adopted the form of symposiums of industrial and commercial circles or meetings of cooperative representatives, were mostly material exchange conferences organized with actual transactions as the main focus. Many areas also used the old temple fair form. Through the above various material exchange methods, the commercial network was restored and developed, new trade relations and transaction routes were established, which greatly promoted industrial and agricultural production.

The preliminary experiences of Zhejiang Province in leading the convening of material exchange conferences are:

    I. First of all, leading cadres at all levels must clearly understand the important significance of convening material exchange conferences. The top leader should take charge, personally and systematically understand the local production and sales situation, meticulously classify and line up commodities, analyze their production and sales patterns, study their development prospects, and formulate practical plans. They should also study the local economic characteristics and grasp the timing of the conference. All relevant departments should be assigned responsibilities to thoroughly organize and mobilize the masses, and at the same time mobilize industrialists and businessmen to participate in the leadership of the conference. Only in this way can the expected results be achieved or exceeded. Conversely, if it is left to its own devices and engaged in blindly, the results will certainly not be great.

    II. State-owned companies and cooperatives must play a leading and exemplary role; at the same time, private industrialists and businessmen must be widely mobilized and absorbed to give full play to their enthusiasm. On the one hand, necessary support should be given in actual transactions to make them profitable; on the other hand, their incorrect attitudes such as "only selling but not buying," "looking at the trend and grabbing hot goods," and "raising prices and killing prices" should be corrected. Through the practical education of the conference, many private merchants changed their attitudes and improved their enthusiasm for business. For example, at the exchange conferences in Huzhou and Shaoxing, the proportion of private merchants' transactions accounted for 50 to 70 percent. Some said: "Old goods have become active goods, cold goods have become hot goods, and slow-selling goods have become fast-selling goods. I have never seen it in forty years." However, in individual places, there are still phenomena of guaranteed purchase and sales, and exclusion of private merchants, resulting in the failure of the public to receive and the private merchants to be bound, and local products are unsalable.

    III. Mastering price policies, market management and tax policies, bank lending and remittance policies, and preparing transportation work are important guarantees for the success of the conference. In terms of price policy, the basic principle should be to take care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales, and should play a role in guiding production and consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve the requirements of high quality and high price, low quality and low price, stable prices, and reasonable price differences. Popular goods should have appropriate profits on the basis of small profits and quick turnover; marketable goods should appropriately maintain the policy of small profits and quick turnover; slow-selling goods should be sold even at a slight loss in order to accelerate capital turnover or transfer production. It is necessary to correct the erroneous practices of simply pursuing profits, disregarding policies, and suppressing prices and rushing to buy (such as the Ninghai Cooperative reducing the price of broad beans by 200 yuan per catty, and the local product company also lowering the price of striped mullet by 200 to 300 yuan per catty. There is also a phenomenon of improving quality and lowering prices in the purchase of rapeseed in various places); it is also necessary to criticize the erroneous ideas of unlimitedly raising the prices of local products and unconditionally shortening the scissors difference. This practice is actually a principled mistake that harms the interests of farmers and the worker-peasant alliance (for example, the price of mustard in this province is higher than the mustard transported from Sichuan, and the price of firewood and charcoal is also high. The prices of many small local products are also too high, resulting in the failure of the public to guarantee, the reluctance of private merchants to receive, and the difficulty in selling them, and the farmers complain). In market management, it must be reasonable and beneficial to material exchange. It is necessary to prevent speculative merchants from raising prices, suppressing prices, using inferior goods to pass off as good goods, using fake goods to pass off as real goods, using large scales to enter and small scales to exit, and other speculative activities, and to give private merchants convenience in operation and give play to their enthusiasm.

    In addition, it is necessary to correctly grasp tax policies, collect taxes in accordance with regulations, overcome the problems of being too high or too low, simplify procedures, and speed up exchanges; banks should do a good job in warehousing, remittance and lending services; transportation and handling services should ensure rapid and safe transportation, fair and reasonable freight rates, and simplify remittance of payment and transportation and handling procedures to facilitate exchanges.

    IV. The guiding principle for organizing exchanges should be: seeking truth from facts, having both buying and selling, buying and selling more, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit. It is necessary to oppose both blindly pursuing numbers and the conservative style of passively waiting. It is also necessary to oppose the attitude of only selling but not buying, selling more and buying less, only buying popular goods and not buying slow-selling goods, and only solving one's own difficulties and not solving other people's difficulties. Use popular goods to drive slow-selling goods, and slow-selling goods to exchange and drive each other. In particular, it is necessary to focus on organizing short-distance exchanges of small local products, and correct the erroneous concepts of sticking to old sales channels, relying on foreign sales, and waiting for allocation. In terms of transaction methods, there should be a variety of methods, mainly: cash on delivery, cash on future delivery, pre-ordering futures, bartering, consignment sales, joint purchase and joint sales, etc. However, cash transactions must be the main focus, supplemented by short-term futures. The contract agreement time should not be too long. In some counties and cities, the proportion of futures is too large, and the contract time is too long, and there are phenomena of changing one's mind after the meeting, which weakens the actual role of the meeting. For example, in Wenzhou, 27 contracts and 88 agreements expired in May, but only 14 contracts and 16 agreements were fully implemented as scheduled.

The experience of combining material exchange conferences with political work and cultural entertainment activities has been generally neglected in various places. Only the Jiaxing County Party Committee has explored the following preliminary experiences:

    I. In addition to relying on state-owned enterprises and cooperatives economically, Party organizations and the people's government must also rely on political work to realize leadership over the market. Therefore, at the material exchange conference, all propaganda tools should be used (mainly mastering wired broadcasting stations, one set up in the exchange and one set up in the retail market. The rest, such as loudspeakers, blackboards, quick reports, cartoons, etc., all revolve around the broadcasting station) to focus on publicizing policies, introducing commodities, and ensuring the realization of the scheduled transaction plan. From the timely grasp of the market's transaction dynamics, repeatedly carry out education on "worker-peasant alliance," "taking into account both public and private interests," as well as trade policies and new business ethics, and pay special attention to introducing various benefits to farmers in the market (such as service stations, acquisition points, clinics, etc.), and focus on guiding the actual trade. For example, the local cool hats that more than 3,000 people in four townships of Yuyao rely on for their livelihood have 14,000 finished products on the market. They could not be sold for three days. After propaganda on the fourth day, they were sold out immediately, and long-term contracts were signed. The broad beans brought by farmers in the countryside were only sold for 200 catties in three days. After propaganda, 8,800 catties were sold immediately.

    II. Combining the material exchange conference with cultural entertainment can, on the one hand, liven up the venue and attract customers, and on the other hand, achieve the purpose of educating the masses. For example, Yue opera, movies, folk art, and circuses that were active at the Jiaxing Material Exchange Conference had a total audience of 93,040 people. A Yue opera performance had a maximum audience of 30,000 people, and thousands of people still watched with umbrellas in the rain. These educational movies and dramas gave the broad masses extremely beneficial influence.

    III. Combining political propaganda with production propaganda. Promote "worker-peasant alliance" and "urban-rural mutual assistance" through sample exhibitions; at the same time, guide farmers' handicraft production on how to improve quality and improve specifications. In the autumn, a large-scale production exhibition can be arranged to summarize the results of the bumper harvest competition, commend labor models, introduce advanced farming methods, introduce new agricultural tools, introduce the achievements of various types of mutual aid organizations, and exhibit model patriotic covenants. At the same time, various departments can set up a variety of propaganda sheds with patriotic health campaigns, marriage law, Sino-Soviet friendship, etc. as the content, so that the material exchange conference becomes an important form of large-scale political propaganda and production propaganda combined to the peasants.

    IV. A propaganda committee was established at the Jiaxing Material Exchange Conference to uniformly lead the propaganda work of the conference. The propaganda committee has four groups: broadcasting, entertainment, film, and interview. There are a total of 517 cultural and propaganda workers. In addition to the art troupe and film team from the province, there are folk art performers, circuses, and amateur drama troupes. Such a huge propaganda team from various units and the broad masses cannot achieve the expected propaganda effect without such a sound propaganda organization to uniformly lead them.

    浙江省召开物资交流会议的经验
    浙江省参加华东区城乡物资交流大会后，该省大部县市也先后举行了交流大会，目前物资交流工作已获初步成绩。从五月下旬到六月底为止的统计，在华东区城乡物资交流大会上共成交二千八百五十九亿元，在浙江省物资交流会上成交七百十三亿元，在两个专区及三十八个县、市的交流会上成交一千二百十五亿元。全省主要土产（如大豆、毛竹、笋干、生姜、文化用纸）由滞销变为畅销，滞销商品占总成交额的百分之二十七点五三。同时，组织了工业品下乡，适当解决了城市工业品积压，在省、专区、县、市交流大会上成交的商品，工业品占百分之二十九。各级交流大会均具体体现了鼓励私营企业正当经营的政策，提高了私商的积极性。省级交流大会交易的比重是：国营经济占百分之三十五，合作社占百分之二十五，私商占百分之四十。专区、县、市级交流大会的平均比重：在购进方面：国营经济占百分之二十六，合作社占百分之十七，私商占百分之五十七；在销售方面：国营经济占百分之二十六点五，合作社占百分之三十一点零七，私商占百分之四十二点四三。专区、县、市的物资交流大会，除个别县采用工商界座谈会或合作社代表会议形式外，绝大多数是组织了以实际交易为主的物资交流大会，不少地区还运用了旧有的庙会形式。通过以上各种物资交流办法，恢复并发展了商业网，建立了新的贸易关系和交易路线，对工农业生产有很大的推动作用。
    浙江省领导召开物资交流大会的初步经验是：
    一、首先要使各级领导干部明确认识召开物资交流大会的重要意义，首长负责、亲自动手有系统地了解本地的产销情况，细致地进行商品的分类排队，分析其产销规律，研究其发展前途，订出切合实际的计划。并研究当地经济特点，掌握召开大会的时机。各有关部门应分工负责，深入做好群众的组织动员工作，同时发动工商业者参加大会的领导工作。如此才能收到或超过预期的效果。反之，如果放任自流，盲目从事，其收效一定不大。
    二、国营公司、合作社必须起领导、带头作用；同时必须广泛地动员和吸收私营工商业者参加，充分发挥其积极性。一方面在实际交易中给予必要的扶持，使之有利可图；另一方面端正其“只卖不买”、“看苗头、抢热货”、“抬价杀价”等不正确的态度。经过会议的实际教育，不少私商转变了态度，提高了经营积极性。如湖州和绍兴的交流大会上，私商交易比重占到百分之五十到七十。有的说：“陈货变成活货，冷货变成热货，滞销变成畅销，活了四十年没见过。”但个别地方还有包收包购、排斥私商的现象，结果公家收不了，私商裹足，土产滞销。
    三、掌握价格政策、市场管理与税收政策、银行贷汇政策及准备好交通运输工作，是开好大会的重要保证。在价格政策上，应以照顾产、运、销三方面的利益为基本原则，并要起到指导生产、指导消费的作用。因此，要做到优货优价、劣货低价、价格稳定、差价合理的要求。畅销品要在薄利多销的基础上有适当的利润；行销品适当的保持薄利多销政策；滞销品即稍亏本亦出售，以便加速资金周转，或转业生产。既要纠正单纯追求利润、不顾政策、压价抢购等错误作法（如宁海合作社收蚕豆每斤压价二百元，土产公司收勒鱼每斤也低二、三百元，各地收购菜籽亦有提高质量压低价格的现象）；又要批判无限制抬高土产价格，无条件地缩短剪刀差额等错误思想。这种作法实际上是损害农民利益与工农联盟的原则错误（如本省榨菜价格比四川运来的榨菜还高，柴炭价亦高，许多小土产价格也有偏高的，结果公家包不了，私商不肯收，销不出去农民叫苦）。在市场管理上，必须合情合理，有利于物资交流，既要防止投机商人的抬价、压价，以劣充好，以假充真，大秤进，小秤出等投机活动，又要给私商经营以便利，发挥其积极性。
    此外，要正确掌握税收政策，照章收税，克服偏高偏低的毛病，并简便手续，敏捷交流；银行做好押汇、汇款业务与贷放业务；运输、搬运业务应保证运输迅速安全，运价公平合理，并应简化汇兑货款与运输搬运手续，有利交流。
    四、组织交流的方针应是：实事求是，有买有卖，多买多卖，互助互利。既反对盲目追求数字，也反对消极等待的保守作风。还要反对只卖不买，多卖少买，只买畅销货，不买滞销货，只解决自己困难，不解决别人困难的态度。以畅销带动滞销，滞销相互交换相互带动。特别要着重组织小土产的近距离交流，纠正固守旧销路，依靠外销、等待调拨等错误观念。在交易方式上，要多种多样，主要有：现货现款、现货期款、预定期货、以货易货，委托购销，联购联销等。但必须以现货买卖为主，短期期货为辅。合同协议时间不可太长。有的县、市期货比重过大，合同时间过长，会后又有变卦现象，也就削弱了会议的实际作用。如温州五月份到期的成交有二十七笔合同，八十八件协议，但全部如期执行者仅合同十四件，协议十六件。
    关于物资交流大会与政治工作、文化娱乐活动相结合的经验，各地均普遍忽视。只有嘉兴县委摸索了如下初步经验：
    一、党的组织和人民政府除了在经济上依靠国营企业和合作社，还必须依靠政治工作，来实现对市场的领导。因此，在物资交流大会上，应运用一切宣传工具（主要是掌握有线广播台，一个设在交易所，一个设在零售市场。其余如喇叭筒、黑板报、快报、漫画等都围绕着广播台进行活动）来集中宣传政策，介绍商品，保证预订的交易计划的实现。从及时掌握市场的交易动态中，反复进行“工农联盟”、“公私兼顾”，以及对贸易政策和新的经营道德的教育，还要特别注意介绍市场上对农民的各种福利（如服务站、收购处、门诊所等），而着重指导实际贸易的进行。如虞姚四个乡三千余人赖以为生的土凉帽，有一万四千顶现货上市。三天卖不出去，第四天经过宣传后，当即一销而光，还订立了长期合同。乡下农民带来的蚕豆，三天只销二百斤，经宣传后，当即销售八千八百斤。
    二、物资交流大会与文化娱乐相结合，一方面可以起活跃会场、招揽顾客的作用，另一方面可以达到教育群众的目的。如在嘉兴物资交流大会上活动的越剧、电影、曲艺、马戏等，共有观众九万三千零四十人，越剧一场，观众最多的一次达到三万人，天落雨还有几千人撑着伞看。这些富有教育意义的电影和戏剧，给广大群众以极为有益的影响。
    三、政治宣传与生产宣传相结合。通过样品展览会来宣传“工农联盟”、“城乡互助”；同时指导农民的手工业生产如何提高质量，改进规格。在秋季可以布置大型生产品展览会，总结丰产竞赛成绩，表扬劳动模范，介绍先进耕作法，介绍新式农具，介绍各种类型的互助组织的成绩，并展览模范的爱国公约。同时可由各部门分别以爱国卫生运动、婚姻法、中苏友好等为内容，布置多种多样的宣传棚，使物资交流大会成为大规模向农民进行政治宣传和生产宣传相结合的重要形式。
    四、嘉兴的物资交流大会上成立了宣传委员会，统一领导大会的宣传工作。宣传委员会下设广播、文娱、电影、采访四个组。共有文化宣传工作者五百一十七人，除省里下来的文工团、电影队外，其中有曲艺说唱艺人、马戏团、还有业余剧团等。这样庞大的来自各个单位及广大群众的宣传队伍，如果没有这样一个健全的宣传机构来统一领导，是不能收到预期的宣传效果的。
