At the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce preparatory representative meeting, grand sessions were held on the afternoon of the 27th, the 28th, and the morning of the 29th, with 124 representatives speaking at the meeting. Since the opening of the meeting on the 20th, all representatives had participated in group discussions on the opening speech by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the preparatory committee, the report by Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and speeches by various leaders. The general discussion began on the afternoon of the 27th. At the meeting, the representatives spoke enthusiastically, expressing their understanding of the "Five-Anti" movement and their feelings about the reports of Chairman Chen Shutong and Director Chen Yun. The meeting fully promoted the spirit of democracy and unity.

During the speeches at the general assembly, the representatives unanimously agreed that the "Five-Anti" movement was a movement to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, to treat the illness to save the patient, and a great social reform movement to change customs and habits, which had a decisive significance for the transformation of industrialists and businessmen. The People's Government, adhering to the principle of combining strictness with leniency and transformation with punishment, implemented lenient treatment in the verification of cases, refund of property, and supplementary tax payments after strictly investigating the "five poisons" of industrialists and businessmen. Through this mass movement, the political consciousness of industrialists and businessmen has been raised compared to before. As long as industrialists and businessmen honestly abide by the Common Program and the leadership of the state-owned economy and thoroughly eliminate the "five poisons," their future will be even brighter. Therefore, this preparatory representative meeting marks a new beginning, in which the nation's legitimate industrialists and businessmen, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, adhere to the Common Program, actively develop their operations, and strive for the economic construction of new China.

In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their complete agreement with and support for the opening speech by Chairman Chen Shutong and the report by Director Chen Yun. Everyone believed that the brilliant achievements in economic construction in the past three years of new China were infinitely encouraging, and these achievements could only be achieved under the people's regime led by the Communist Party. Regarding the resolution of some new problems that emerged after the "Five-Anti" movement, such as adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-capital relations, the representatives believed that the seven instructions proposed by Director Chen Yun in his report were very practical and expressed satisfaction. At the same time, many representatives also made guarantees. Li Zhuchen, a representative from Tianjin, said: "In order to further provide strength for the country's economic construction, we propose the following three guarantees: First, strengthen learning, resolutely abide by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government, and actively engage in production and management under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. First of all, we must study the Common Program to make personal interests subordinate to the common interests of all the people. Second, facing the countryside, actively engage in production, ensure genuine quality and fair prices to win the trust of consumers, reduce costs, serve the working class and the peasantry, and further improve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Third, guarantee the implementation of reasonable management, strengthen democratic management, learn advanced technical experience, and strive for technical progress to gradually improve backward production technology, in order to welcome the high tide of the country's economic construction." Ao Feng (Mongolian), a representative from Rehe Province, said: "In the past, industrialists and businessmen had conducted learning, but they did not connect it well with reality or conduct criticism and self-criticism, so the gains were not great. In the future, we must follow the spirit indicated by Chairman Chen Shutong in his opening speech and conduct organized and planned learning in connection with reality under the unified leadership of the local consultation committees or standing committees in order to achieve thorough transformation." Sheng Pihua, a representative from Shanghai, said: "Of the seven instructions in Director Chen Yun's report, six are about taking care of us industrialists and businessmen, but the last one specifically points out that industrialists and businessmen must not commit the 'five poisons' again. This is very important, and we industrialists and businessmen should keep it firmly in mind as a motto, and ensure that our words and deeds are consistent and truly put it into practice." Chen Jingyu, a representative from Wuhan, said: "We will definitely convey the content of the meeting well when we return, so that the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan and even the Central South region, after clearing away the 'five poisons,' will strive for the economic construction of the new democracy under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy!" Huang Changshui, a representative from Guangdong Province, said: "At this meeting, many difficult problems of us industrialists and businessmen have been resolved. We must strengthen learning and transform our thinking in the future. All the representatives from Guangdong are determined to actively study the Common Program after returning, and we must ensure that all industrialists and businessmen thoroughly eliminate the 'five poisons' in their thinking and actions, and guarantee that they will never commit them again in the future." Gong Tianmin, a representative from Shenyang, said: "The Northeast was cruelly exploited by the Japanese invaders after the 'September 18th' Incident, and national industrialists and businessmen were in a state of bankruptcy. After liberation, due to the large state-owned industrial base in the Northeast, under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, industrialists and businessmen generally recovered and developed. We should thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party, and thank the Central and all levels of the People's Government for their help." Hu Ziang, a representative from Chongqing, said in his speech: "We completely agree with Chairman Chen Shutong's point in his opening speech that the Common Program is the only standard for measuring whether industrialists and businessmen are beneficial or harmful, active or passive to the people, and we are willing to strive for the implementation of the Common Program, to obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and to establish a new morality and new atmosphere for industrialists and businessmen." Hou Debang, a specially invited representative, said: "Director Chen Yun instructed us on seven important issues: the interpretation of legitimate profits, the specifications for processing and ordering goods, the exchange of goods, bank interest, tax methods, labor-capital relations, and preventing the recurrence of the three evils and five poisons, which have given us good inspiration. We will resolutely implement them after returning to prepare for the peak season in the autumn and winter of the second half of the year."

In their speeches at the meeting, representatives from various regions introduced the development of local industry and commerce or their own enterprises since liberation, and unanimously thanked the correct leadership and multifaceted support of state-owned economic departments. Ma Xinquan, a representative from Heilongjiang Province, said: "The industry and commerce of Heilongjiang Province have only developed after liberation with the assistance of the People's Government. Take Qiqihar City as an example, there were only 500 industrial and commercial households before liberation, and now it has developed to 4,900 households." Tang Di-yin, an investor in Shanghai's private Lvbao Gold Pen Factory, is a woman who has been engaged in industry and commerce for 20 years. She said: "The Lvbao Gold Pen Factory was unable to maintain itself in the end of 1948 due to the destruction of the Kuomintang reactionary government's gold yuan currency policy. In the early days of Shanghai's liberation in September 1949, due to the purchase and ordering of goods by state-owned department stores, the factory quickly recovered from its dying state. In the first quarter of 1950, it initially developed and shifted from manufacturing fountain pens to manufacturing gold pens. In January 1951, the factory produced 200 dozen gold pens, and starting in September of the same year, the output increased to 1,500 dozen per month." Tang Di-yin said, "Such development is inseparable from the leadership of the state-owned economy." She said: "In July of this year, the Lvbao Gold Pen Factory will increase its output to 1,800 dozen." Qu Guanying, a representative from Shaanxi Province, talked about the broad prospects for the future development of industry and commerce in the Northwest region in his speech. He said that Shaanxi Province has superior raw materials, rich minerals, a large number of local products, and simple and hardworking manpower, as well as a market needed by the vast people of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. The Longhai Railway will be open to Lanzhou in October, and the Tiancheng Road is also under construction, so transportation will be accessible in all directions in the future. These all show that the development of industry and commerce in Shaanxi Province has superior conditions and great prospects. We very much hope and welcome industrialists and businessmen from advanced regions and overseas Chinese to invest and operate here.

Many representatives also introduced the new atmosphere of private industry and commerce after the removal of the "five poisons" in their speeches at the meeting. Le Songsheng, a representative from Beijing, introduced that after the "Five-Anti" movement, the workers and shop assistants of private enterprises in Beijing, under the leadership and call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, took the initiative to unite with the capitalists to improve production. The Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Federation of Industry and Commerce separately convened industry and regional industrial and commercial conferences to explain policies to them and mobilize industrialists and businessmen to discuss the development of their own production and management, and establish new labor-capital relations. The results of the consultations were generally satisfactory. Many new atmospheres have emerged in labor-capital consultations, such as capitalists taking the initiative to increase capital, purchase equipment, and workers giving full play to their enthusiasm for production and improving quality. Le Songsheng said: "Experience proves that adjusting labor-capital relations is inseparable from developing production." Miao Hainan, a representative from Shandong Province, said: "Because industrialists and businessmen have cleared away the 'five poisons,' an unprecedented new atmosphere has emerged in the industrial and commercial circles. For example, after the Yangben Printing and Dyeing Factory in Qingdao went through the 'Five-Anti' campaign, the quality of its products improved. The rate of substandard 60-count Shilin cloth was 12% in April and decreased to 3% in May. The Dongyuansheng Dyeing Factory in Jinan increased production by about 70% after the 'Five-Anti' campaign compared to before. This factory is relatively technologically advanced in Jinan. After the 'Five-Anti' campaign, the factory's capitalist voluntarily made all the technology public, allowing other factories to come to the factory to learn, in order to improve technology and give play to the role of unity and mutual assistance. The Chengtong Yarn Factory in Jinan, which I am in charge of, had an output of 0.88 pounds per spindle for 20 hours before the 'Five-Anti' campaign. During the 'Five-Anti' movement, due to the workers' insistence on the slogan of 'two things do not interfere with each other, Five-Anti and production,' the output reached 0.95 pounds, and it has now increased to 1.0316 pounds." Zhang Jingli, a representative from the Subei District, said: "Our industrialists and businessmen in Subei and all the people of Subei, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, overcame the serious famine in the early days of liberation and the difficulties in the lack of industrial raw materials, and quickly restored production. The great Huai River water conservancy project has brought infinitely beautiful prospects to the people of Subei. After the 'Five-Anti' movement, the management of Subei's industries, such as textiles, electricity, and flour, has improved, and the production enthusiasm of employees has increased. Therefore, past records have been broken in terms of output, quality, and raw material savings. For example, the Dasheng Yarn Factory in Nantong is an old enterprise with 53 years of history. After the 'Five-Anti' movement, its appearance has been completely renewed. During the movement, the amount of yarn produced per spindle in 23 hours increased to more than 1.1 pounds."

Among those attending this preparatory representative meeting were representatives of ethnic minorities from various regions, representatives from Hong Kong and Macao, and representatives of overseas Chinese, all of whom spoke at the meeting. Rui Jun (Mongolian), a representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: "In 1951, the number of private industrial and commercial households in Inner Mongolia increased by 46.3%, the total amount of capital increased by 1.2 times, and the total turnover jumped to 2.4 times that of 1950. Private industrialists and businessmen are increasingly developing in Inner Mongolia." Luo Anping (Miao), a representative from Guizhou Province, said: "After liberation, the productivity of our ethnic minority areas has continued to increase, thus also increasing purchasing power. The People's Government's preferential policies for trade in ethnic minority areas have enabled the people of our ethnic minority areas to wear cheap cloth and eat cheap salt." Abulizi (Uyghur), a representative from Xinjiang Province, said: "Before liberation, the vast people in Xinjiang's rural and pastoral areas could only exchange 14 kilograms of wool for one brick of tea. After liberation, the People's Government helped the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang increase the prices of local and special products, and 14 kilograms of wool could be exchanged for four bricks of tea." A representative from Hong Kong said: "Hong Kong compatriots love the motherland and care about the construction of the motherland. Our delegation guarantees to convey the significance and tasks of this meeting well to them, so that they can cooperate with everyone in thinking and action." Yi Meihou (Siam), a representative of overseas Chinese, said: "The vast majority of overseas Chinese love the motherland and love Chairman Mao. They are abroad, but their hearts are in the motherland. Overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, like domestic industrialists and businessmen, have done their best for patriotic work and participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They are always concerned about the motherland. In recent years, they have received news from their hometowns that social order is peaceful, people's lives are stable, and industry and commerce are gradually prosperous, and they are very excited. Therefore, the number of overseas Chinese returning from abroad is increasing day by day, overseas Chinese capital has begun to be invested in the motherland, and overseas remittances are constantly increasing. We believe that during the period of large-scale economic construction in the motherland, overseas Chinese will definitely be able to contribute more manpower, material resources, and financial resources. We must do our best to convey the spirit of this conference to overseas Chinese."

Lin Liangcai, a representative from Taiwan, reported on the recent economic situation in Taiwan and the plight of Taiwan's national industry and commerce at the meeting. He said: "Due to the flood of goods from the United States and Japan and the looting of the Kuomintang remnants, the financial market in Taiwan is chaotic, prices fluctuate, the production of national industry and commerce is stagnant, sales are stagnant, and closures are spreading throughout the province. The three largest private iron factories in Taiwan, 'Tianyuan' in Taichung, closed down last September, and 'Datong' in Taipei and 'Tangrong' in Kaohsiung are also lacking raw materials, sales are stagnant, and capital turnover is not smooth. In terms of the textile industry, due to the impact of American and Japanese goods and the severe shortage of cotton yarn supply, production has generally stalled."

The representatives generally conducted criticism and self-criticism in their speeches at the meeting, guaranteeing to convey the spirit and gains of this meeting well.

Ye Jizhuang, a representative of the general organization of state-owned enterprises, made a concise explanation of issues such as processing orders, urban-rural exchanges, and domestic and foreign exchanges in his speech at the meeting. Meng Yongqian, a representative of the National Cooperative Association, introduced the current development of cooperatives across the country to the participants and explained the role of urban consumer cooperatives and rural production and marketing cooperatives. Meng Yongqian said: "The entire cooperative organization, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, will resolutely undertake the task of urban-rural and domestic-foreign exchanges together with public and private commerce in accordance with the spirit of adjusting public-private relations and labor-capital relations in this meeting."

    在全国工商联筹备代表会议上一百二十四个代表发言
    愿遵守共同纲领积极改进生产和经营
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议在二十七日下午、二十八日和二十九日上午举行大会，一百二十四个代表在大会上发言。会议自二十日开幕以来，全体代表曾先后分组深入讨论了大会主席陈叔通的开幕词和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会主任陈云的报告以及各首长的讲话。从二十七日下午开始大会讨论，在大会上，代表们发言极为踊跃，纷纷表示自己对“五反”运动的认识，和对陈叔通主席、陈云主任两个报告的感想，会议充分发扬了民主和团结的精神。
    在大会发言中，代表们一致认为“五反”运动是一个惩前毖后、治病救人的运动，也是一个伟大的移风易俗的社会改革运动，对工商业者的改造，有着决定的意义。人民政府本着严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针，在严格地检查了工商业者的“五毒”之后，又在核实定案、退财补税方面，实行宽大处理。通过这次群众性的运动，工商业者的政治觉悟已较前提高。工商业者今后只要老老实实遵守共同纲领和国营经济的领导，彻底肃清“五毒”后，前途就更加光明了。因此，这次筹备代表会议标志着一个新的开始，就是全国正当工商业者在工人阶级和国营经济的领导之下，信守共同纲领，积极发展经营，为新中国经济建设而努力。
    代表们发言中对于陈叔通主席的开幕词和陈云主任的报告，一致表示完全同意和拥护。大家认为新中国三年来在经济建设上的辉煌成就，使人感到无限振奋，这些成就只有在共产党领导下的人民政权才能取得的。关于解决“五反”运动后出现的一些新问题，如调整公私关系和劳资关系等，代表们认为陈云主任在报告中所提出的七点指示非常切合实际，一致表示满意。同时，许多代表也提出了保证。天津代表李烛尘说：为了能够进一步给祖国的经济建设提供力量，我们提出下面三点保证来：第一，加强学习，坚决遵守共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下积极生产经营。首先要学习共同纲领，使个人的利益服从于全体人民共同的利益。第二，面向农村，积极生产，保证货真价实，以取信于消费者，减低成本，为工农大众服务，进一步做好城乡物资交流工作。第三，保证实行合理经营，加强民主管理，学习先进技术经验，争取技术上的进步，使落后的生产技术逐步提高，为迎接祖国经济建设高潮而努力。热河省代表敖凤（蒙族）说：“过去工商业者曾进行过学习，但没有很好地联系实际，展开批评和自我批评，因此收获不大。今后我们一定本着陈叔通主席在开幕词中指示的精神，在当地协商委员会或常务委员会统一领导下，有组织地有计划地联系实际进行学习，以便求得彻底改造。”上海市代表盛丕华说：“陈云主任报告中的七点指示，除了六点是关于照顾我们工商业者的外，最后一点特别指出工商业者不能再犯‘五毒’。这一点是很重要的，我们工商业者应该牢牢记住作为座右铭，要保证言行一致切实做到。”武汉市代表陈经畬说：“我们回去一定好好传达大会的内容，使我们武汉市以至中南区的工商界，在清除‘五毒’之后，在工人阶级与国营经济领导下，为新民主主义的经济建设而奋斗！”广东省代表黄长水说：“在这次会议中，我们工商业者很多困难问题都得到解决。我们今后一定加强学习、改造思想。广东全体代表都下了决心，回去以后积极学习共同纲领，务必做到全体工商业者在思想上和行动上，彻底消除‘五毒’，并保证今后不再重犯。”沈阳市代表巩天民说：“东北在‘九一八’后受日寇残酷压榨，民族工商业者处于破产状态，解放后由于东北国营工业基础较大，在国营经济领导和扶助之下，工商业者普遍地恢复并得到了发展。我们应当感谢毛主席，感谢共产党，感谢中央以及各级人民政府的帮助。”重庆市代表胡子昂在发言中说：“我们完全同意陈叔通主席在开幕词中指出的，以共同纲领为衡量工商业者对人民有利或有害、积极或消极的唯一标准，并愿为执行共同纲领，服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，树立工商业者的新道德、新风气而奋斗。”特邀代表侯德榜说：“陈云主任指示我们七个重要问题：合法利润的解释、加工订货的规格、物资交流、银行利息、税收办法、劳资关系，及防止再犯三害、五毒等，都给了我们很好的启发，我们回去后一定坚决执行，以备迎接下半年的秋冬旺季。”
    在大会发言中，各地代表介绍了当地工商业或自己所经营的企业在解放以来的发展情况，一致感谢国营经济部门的正确领导和多方扶助。黑龙江省代表麻新泉说：“黑龙江省的工商业，是在解放后经人民政府的扶助，才得到了发展。就拿齐齐哈尔市来说，解放前只有五百工商业户，现在已发展到四千九百户。”上海私营绿宝金笔厂的投资人汤蒂因，是一个从事工商业二十年的妇女。她说：绿宝金笔厂在一九四八年底曾因国民党反动政府的金圆券政策的摧残而无法维持。一九四九年九月上海解放初期，由于国营百货公司的收购和定货，该厂就从奄奄一息的困境很快得到了恢复。在一九五零年第一季度，就初步发展，由制造钢笔转向制造金笔。在一九五一年一月，该厂出产金笔二百打，同年九月开始，产量增加到每月一千五百打。汤蒂因说：“这样一个发展，是和国营经济的领导分不开的。”她说：今年七月份绿宝金笔厂将把产量提高到一千八百打。陕西省代表瞿冠英在发言中谈到西北区今后工商业发展的广阔前途，他说陕西省有优厚的原料、丰富的矿产、大量的土产及朴素耐劳的人力，并有陕甘宁广大人民需要的市场，而陇海路十月间可通至兰州，天成路也在动工，今后交通可算四通八达。这些都说明陕西省工商业的发展备具优越的条件和极大的远景，我们十二分愿望和欢迎先进地区的工商业者及海外侨胞都向这里来投资经营。
    许多代表在大会发言中，还介绍了私营工商业在去除“五毒”后所呈现的新气象。北京市代表乐松生发言中，介绍了北京市私营企业的工人店员，“五反”运动后在市总工会的领导号召下，主动团结资方搞好生产，北京市人民政府和工商业联合会分别召开行业、地区工商业者会议，向他们讲解政策，发动工商业者讨论发展本身的生产和经营，建立新的劳资关系，协商的结果一般都很圆满。劳资协商中出现了许多新气象，如资方主动增加资金，添购设备，工人发挥生产热情，提高质量等动人事实。乐松生说：“经验证明调整劳资关系是和发展生产分不开的。”山东省代表苗海南说：“工商业者因为清除了‘五毒’，工商界出现了空前未有的新气象。譬如青岛市阳本印染厂经过‘五反’后，产品质量提高，染六十号士林布的次布率，四月份是百分之十二，五月份就降低到百分之三。济南市东元盛染厂，‘五反’后比‘五反’前生产提高了百分之七十左右。该厂在济南市是技术比较进步的，‘五反’后，该厂资方自动将技术全部公开，让其他工厂到该厂学习，借以提高技术，发挥了团结互助的作用。我所负责的济南市成通纱厂，在‘五反’前，每锭二十小时的产量为零点八八磅。在‘五反’运动中，由于工人坚持了‘五反、生产两不误’的口号，产量达到了零点九五磅，目前已提高到一点零三一六磅。”苏北区代表张敬礼说：“我们苏北工商业者和苏北全体人民一道在毛主席和人民政府领导下，战胜了解放初期的严重灾荒，克服了工业原料缺乏的困难，迅速恢复了生产，伟大的淮河水利工程，尤其给苏北人民带来了无限美好的前途。在‘五反’运动之后，苏北的工业，如纺织、电气、面粉等工厂，管理改善，职工的生产热情提高，因此在产量、质量和原料的节约上都打破了过去的纪录。譬如南通市的大生纱厂，是一个有五十三年历史的旧企业。经过‘五反’运动之后，面目已焕然一新。在运动期间，每锭二十三小时产纱量已提高到一点一磅以上。”
    出席这次筹备代表会议的，有各地区的少数民族的代表、港澳代表、华侨代表，他们都曾在大会上发言。内蒙古自治区代表锐军（蒙族）说：内蒙古在“一九五一年中，私营工商业户数增加了百分之四十六点三，资本总额增加了一点二倍，营业总额跃升为一九五零年的二点四倍。私营工商业者在内蒙古正日益发展”。贵州省代表罗安平（苗族）说：“我们少数民族地区解放后，生产力不断提高，因此也提高了购买力。人民政府对于少数民族地区贸易的优待政策，使我们少数民族地区的人民得穿便宜的布，吃便宜的盐。”新疆省代表阿不力孜（维吾尔族）说：“新疆农村和牧区的广大人民，解放前以十四公斤羊毛只能换取茶砖一块。解放后，人民政府帮助新疆各民族人民提高土产特产的价格，用十四公斤羊毛可以换取四块茶砖。”香港代表说：“香港同胞热爱祖国，关心祖国建设。我们代表团保证要把这次会议的意义和任务好好向他们传达，使他们在思想上和行动上和大家配合起来。”华侨代表蚁美厚（暹罗）说：“国外华侨绝大多数是热爱祖国热爱毛主席的。他们身在国外，心在祖国。华侨工商界人士和国内工商业者一样，对爱国工作尽了他们的力量，参加抗美援朝捐献运动。他们时时刻刻关心祖国。近年来他们得到侨乡传去的消息说，社会秩序安宁，人民生活稳定，工商业逐渐繁荣，他们是非常兴奋的。因此从国外回国的华侨一天比一天多，华侨资本已经开始向祖国投入，侨汇不断增加。我们相信在祖国大规模经济建设到来时期，国外华侨一定能够贡献出更多的人力物力和财力。我们一定要尽力把这次大会的精神传达给国外华侨。”
    台湾代表林良材在大会上报告了台湾最近的经济情况和台湾民族工商业的苦境。他说：“由于美国、日本的商品充满市场和国民党残匪的抢夺，台湾金融市场混乱，物价波动，民族工商业生产停顿、销路停滞，停业倒风弥蔓全省各地。台湾最大的三家私营铁工厂，台中的‘天源’已经在去年九月倒闭，台北的‘大同’和高雄的‘唐荣’也因为缺乏原料，销路停滞，资金周转不灵。纺织业方面，由于受到美货日货的打击，加以棉纱供应非常缺乏，生产已普遍停顿。”
