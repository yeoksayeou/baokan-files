    The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China has traversed thirty-one years on the long road of Chinese revolution and construction.
    In the past year, our Party has led the Chinese people in continuing the just struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, realized land reform in the vast rural areas of the new districts, and achieved significant accomplishments in strengthening national defense, increasing industrial and agricultural production, developing railway transportation and water conservancy construction, popularizing culture, and transforming ideology. Our Party also led the staff of state organs in launching a large-scale movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and also led the broad masses of the people and the industrial and commercial sectors in a movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. These two great movements have profoundly educated the people of the whole country, criticized the dark side of the bourgeoisie's corruption and degeneration, consolidated the people's democratic united front, brought about a new social atmosphere, and greatly rectified the work of all organs and organizations. Many new creations and new figures have emerged, preparing good conditions for large-scale national construction in the future.
    The organization of the Communist Party of China and every Party member have also undergone a historic test in these two great movements. This is a test that must be experienced in the process of such a huge revolutionary victory from entering the cities from the countryside, from the dispersed revolutionary base area regime to the national regime. Facts have proven that the Communist Party of China can not only lead the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory, but also lead the Chinese people to build their new country at an astonishing speed. But of course, we still need to be wary of certain potentially degenerate elements. Our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong had already foreseen this in March 1949, when the national revolutionary victory was approaching:
  “Because of victory, arrogance, a sense of self-proclaimed merit, stagnation and unwillingness to make progress, and a desire for pleasure and unwillingness to live a hard life may grow within the Party. And the bourgeoisie's flattery may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be some Communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and who deserve the title of hero in the face of these enemies; but who cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and who will be defeated in the face of sugar bombs.” A few Party members in our Party have failed this test and fallen; however, our Party, as a fighting whole, is moving more vigorously towards the road of new victory. After these two great movements, the organization of our Party will be further rectified and consolidated, and we will further strengthen the work of Party building.
    Our task of rectifying and building the Party is to improve the quality of Party members and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness in accordance with the standards of Communist Party members, so as to lead the people of the whole country to fight for the industrialization of the country and the future of socialism. Some bourgeois elements and other alien class elements who have sneaked into the Party, degenerate and decadent elements, and incorrigible elements who refuse the Party's education must be purged. For activists who have emerged from the masses on all fronts who request to join the Party, and who have been proven through investigation to be of excellent quality and meet the standards of Communist Party members, they should be actively and prudently absorbed. For all Communist Party members, the most important thing that we must not forget at all times is to strive to improve ourselves as a Communist Party member.
    Party committees at all levels must further carry out the work of Party rectification and Party building in a planned and guided manner. In factories, mines, cooperatives, state organs, and schools, as well as in rural areas, the Party must not relax its regular and systematic ideological and political leadership in the slightest. The work of Party rectification and Party building must be combined with the various construction undertakings of our country, especially the economic construction centered on industry, and with the aim of leading and promoting national construction. This goal is long-term, in order to transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country, and to push our country to the future of socialism.
    The task of large-scale economic construction in our country is approaching us day by day. On the one hand, the working class and the broad masses of the people throughout the country must continue to strengthen the resistance to US aggression and aid Korea, and fight to consolidate our national defense. On the other hand, they are jubilantly welcoming the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, regardless of any enemy obstruction. The development of the movement to increase production and practice economy by the broad working people in industry, agriculture, and other production undertakings is a signal of the beginning of this high tide. Mass labor competitions, advanced production experiences and new creations, and new records are constantly emerging, making it inevitable that the face of our various tasks will undergo new and tremendous changes. We must pay attention to all these new changes, and continue to actively mobilize the masses and promote the movement to increase production and practice economy in all aspects. The whole Party must strive to learn in this movement to increase production and practice economy. Communist Party members on the industrial, agricultural production, and other economic fronts must play an exemplary role, lead the masses, continuously improve their political consciousness, and humbly learn from the masses, continuously enrich their knowledge, become familiar with their business, master technology, and improve their management and management capabilities. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party must unite all scientific and technical talents willing to serve the people, conduct in-depth investigations and research work, analyze the situation, and sum up experience.
    There is no doubt that, as mentioned above, our Party is capable of leading the country's economic construction. However, for many of our comrades today, how to lead economic work is still a subject that must be studied seriously. Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Economic Construction Work Conference of Seventeen Counties in Southern Jiangxi in August 1933 still needs to be reviewed by us today. In this speech, Comrade Mao Zedong not only criticized the mistake of "many local governments not focusing on discussing the issue of economic construction," criticized the mistake of "not creating an enthusiastic atmosphere among the masses for struggling for economic construction," criticized the mistake of "people often lamenting the lack of cadres," and so on; but also pointed out to us: "Without correct leadership methods and working methods, it is impossible to quickly launch a movement on the economic front." Although these words of Comrade Mao Zedong were said twenty years ago, they still retain their vivid power.
    Comrade Stalin also gave us extremely important instructions in his speech at the First All-Union Conference of Socialist Industry Workers in February 1931, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan for socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin said: "What is leading production? Some of us do not often view the problem of enterprise leadership from a Bolshevik point of view." Comrade Stalin criticized some people for treating signing documents as leadership, and criticized economic workers for lagging behind in technical knowledge to the point where counter-revolutionary elements could carry out sabotage. Comrade Stalin emphasized that "we must ourselves become specialists, become work experts, and we must ourselves turn to diligently studying technical knowledge," and to "abandon that outdated slogan of non-intervention in technology." In the leadership of economic construction, we must undoubtedly also make ourselves increasingly familiar with economic management and technology, and we must wage a resolute struggle against all backward, conservative ideas and capitalist erroneous ideas.
    In order to enable us to be competent for the tasks of national construction in the future, and in order to further improve the combat effectiveness of our Party, every Communist Party member, in addition to strengthening the study of policies and professional skills, must also systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    In his report to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Generally speaking, all Communist Party members with considerable research capabilities should study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, should study the history of our nation, and should study the current situation and trends of the movement; and through them to educate those Party members with lower cultural levels. In particular, cadres should focus on studying these, and members of the Central Committee and senior cadres should especially intensify their research. It is impossible for a political party that guides a great revolutionary movement to achieve victory if it has no revolutionary theory, no historical knowledge, and no deep understanding of the actual movement." Our Party advanced in accordance with this call of Comrade Mao Zedong, and therefore achieved a great revolutionary victory. There is no doubt that we must now continue to advance in accordance with this call of Comrade Mao Zedong in order to achieve new victories for our country.
    Party organizations at all levels should earnestly lead theoretical study; on the one hand, they should pay attention to appropriately allocating theoretical study and other types of study (professional study, study of current affairs and policies, cultural study), and should not force uniformity, so as to avoid making theoretical study merely a formality; on the other hand, they should enable all cadres with the conditions for conducting theoretical study to conduct their studies appropriately and effectively.
    Cadres of our Party should attach importance to the necessity of systematically acquiring the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. Cadres who only have fragmentary theoretical knowledge should be determined to gradually and systematically study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's basic theories on the Chinese revolution in the next few years, so that their theoretical level can be significantly improved. We should keep in mind Comrade Stalin's words: "If the theory is a real theory, it can give the practical workers the ability to determine the direction, to understand the prospects, to grasp the work, and to believe in the victory of our cause."
    Our Party has gone through thirty-one years, which are the thirty-one years in which our Party has led the Chinese people to carry out earth-shaking changes. We have won the victory, and the Chinese people have cheered this victory. Now, all comrades of our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, must continue to rely closely on the masses of the people, learn from the masses of the people, constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and bravely and humbly, prudently, without arrogance or impetuosity, meet the new great historical tasks that are placed before us.

    增强党的战斗力，迎接国家建设的伟大任务
    ——庆祝中国共产党成立三十一周年——
    伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，在中国革命和建设的长途中，到今天已经走过三十一年了。
    最近这一年，我们的党领导中国人民，继续进行了抗美援朝的正义斗争，实现了广大新区农村的土地改革，并且在加强国防、提高工农业生产、发展铁路交通和水利建设、普及文化、改造思想等各方面，都有重大的成就。我们的党还领导了国家机关的工作人员，展开了一个大规模的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动；还领导了广大人民和工商界进行了反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的运动。这两个伟大的运动，极其生动地给予了全国人民以深刻教育，批判了资产阶级的腐化堕落的黑暗面，巩固了人民民主统一战线，使社会风尚焕然一新，使一切机关、团体的工作有极大的整顿，出现了许多新的创造和新的人物，为今后大规模的国家建设事业准备了良好的条件。
    中国共产党的组织和每一个党员，在这两个伟大的运动中，也受了一次有历史意义的考验。这是从农村进入城市、从分散的革命根据地政权发展到全国政权这样巨大的革命胜利过程中所必须经历的一种考验。事实已经证明，中国共产党不但能够领导中国人民取得革命的胜利，而且能够领导中国人民以惊人的速度来建设自己的新国家。但是当然我们仍需要警戒某些可能堕落的分子。我们党中央和毛泽东同志，在一九四九年三月全国革命胜利快要到来的时候，就已经预见到：
  “因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。而“资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样的一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”在我们党内有少数党员经不住这种考验而倒下去了；但是，我们的党，作为战斗的整体，却更加健强地朝着新的胜利道路前进。我们党的组织经过这两个伟大的运动以后，将进一步整顿并巩固起来，我们将进一步加强党的建设工作。
    我们整顿党和建设党的任务，就是要按照共产党员的标准，提高党员的质量，增强党的战斗力，以便率领全国人民为国家的工业化和社会主义的前途而斗争。对于混进党内来的一些资产阶级分子及其他阶级异己分子，对于腐化堕落的蜕化分子，对于拒绝党的教育的不可救药的分子，必须加以清除。对于各个战线的群众中涌现出来的积极分子要求入党的，经过考察证明品质优秀合于共产党员标准的，应该积极地、慎重地加以吸收。对于一切共产党员来说，我们时时刻刻都不能忘记的最重要的事情，就是为努力提高自己作为共产党员的标准而斗争。
    党的各级领导机关，必须更进一步地有计划、有领导地继续进行整党和建党的工作。在工厂、矿山、合作社、国家机关和学校中，以及在农村中，党对于经常的、系统的思想和政治的领导都不可有半点放松。整党和建党工作都必须和我们国家的各项建设事业，特别是以工业为中心的经济建设结合起来进行，并以领导与推动国家建设为目的。这个目的是长远的，是为了把我们的国家从农业国变为工业国，并为了把我们的国家推向社会主义的前途。
    我们国家的大规模经济建设的任务，正在一天比一天接近到我们的面前了。全国的工人阶级和广大人民，一方面要继续加强抗美援朝，并为巩固我们的国防而斗争，另一方面不顾任何敌人的阻扰而欢欣鼓舞地迎接经济建设高潮的到来。工业、农业和其他生产事业中广大劳动人民的增产节约运动的开展，就是这个高潮开始到来的信号。群众性的劳动竞赛、先进的生产经验和新创造、新纪录不断地出现，使我们的各种工作的面貌不能不发生新的巨大的变化。我们对于这一切新的变化必须加以重视，并继续积极发动群众，推进各方面的增产节约运动。全党都要在这个增产节约运动中努力学习。在工业、农业生产及其他经济战线上的共产党员，更必须起模范作用，带领群众，不断提高政治觉悟，并且要虚心地向群众学习，不断丰富自己的知识，熟悉业务，掌握技术，提高经营和管理的能力。党的各级领导干部，更必须团结一切愿意为人民服务的科学技术人才，深入调查研究工作，分析情况，总结经验。
    毫无疑义的，如前所述，我们的党是能够领导国家的经济建设工作的。但是，对于今天我们很多的同志来说，怎样领导经济工作还是一个必须认真学习的课题。毛泽东同志远在一九三三年八月在江西南部十七县经济建设工作会议上所作的演说，还需要我们今天来温习一下。毛泽东同志在这个演说中不但批评了“许多地方政府没有着重讨论经济建设的问题”的错误，批评了“没有在群众中造成为着经济建设而斗争的热烈的空气”的错误，批评了“人们常常叹气没有干部”的错误，等等；而且向我们指出：“没有正确的领导方式和工作方法，要迅速地开展经济战线上的运动，是不可能的。”毛泽东同志的这些话虽然是二十年前说的，但至今还保留着生动的力量。
    斯大林同志在苏联实行社会主义经济建设的第一次五年计划期间，在一九三一年二月第一次全苏联社会主义工业工作人员代表会议上的演说中，也给了我们以极其重要的指示。斯大林同志说：“什么是领导生产呢？我们有些人并不是常常用布尔什维克观点来看待企业领导问题的。”斯大林同志批评了有些人把签署文件当做领导，批评了经济工作人员在技术知识方面落后得不成样子，以致反革命分子能够进行暗害勾当。斯大林同志强调地指出“要我们自己变成专门家，变成工作内行，要我们自己转而努力学习技术知识”，要“抛弃那种过时的不干预技术的旧口号”。在经济建设的领导工作上，我们无疑地也必须使自己日益熟悉经济管理和技术，并且必须与一切落后的、保守的思想和资本主义的错误思想作坚决的斗争。
    为了使我们能够胜任今后国家建设的任务，为了更加提高我们党的战斗力，每一个共产党员除了必须加强政策和业务的学习以外，一定还要系统地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东同志在一九三八年的六届六中全会的报告中说：“一般地说，一切有相当研究能力的共产党员，都要研究马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，都要研究我们民族的历史，都要研究当前运动的情况和趋势；并经过他们去教育那些文化水准较低的党员。特殊地说，干部应当着重地研究这些，中央委员和高级干部尤其应当加紧研究。指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”我们的党按照毛泽东同志的这个号召前进，因而取得了伟大的革命胜利，毫无疑问，现在我们必须按照毛泽东同志的这个号召继续前进，以取得我们国家的新胜利。
    党的各级领导机构应该切实地把理论学习领导起来；一方面要注意使理论学习和其他各种学习（业务学习、时事与政策的学习、文化学习）适当地配置，不要强求一律，以免使理论学习徒具形式；另一方面要使一切有条件进行理论学习的干部都能适当地和有效地进行学习。
    我们党的干部都应该重视有系统地取得马克思列宁主义的基本知识的必要性。凡是只有片段的理论知识的干部就应该下决心在若干年内逐步地有系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基本理论和毛泽东同志关于中国革命的基本理论，这样才能够使自己的理论水平有显著的提高。我们应该好好记住斯大林同志的话：“理论如果是真正的理论，就能够赋予实际工作者确定方针的能力，明白认识的前途，进行工作的把握，确信我们事业必胜的信念。”
    我们党已经经历了三十一年，这是我们党领导中国人民进行翻天覆地的变革的三十一年。我们是胜利了，中国人民欢呼了这个胜利。现在我们全党同志要在毛泽东同志的领导下，继续紧紧地依靠人民群众，向人民群众学习，经常进行批评和自我批评，谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁地勇敢地去迎接摆在我们面前的新的伟大历史任务。
