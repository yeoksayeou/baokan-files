Party organizations at all levels in North China have been transferring and promoting cadres to strengthen industrial construction.

    In order to earnestly strengthen the national economic construction work centered on industrial construction, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in April to transfer nearly 8,000 cadres from the party committees and people's organizations in the entire region to industrial construction work, and to promote a large number of outstanding elements from the working masses to take on various leadership roles in industrial and mining enterprises. Party organizations in all provinces and cities in North China have taken all necessary measures to carry out this major and urgent political task.

    In terms of transferring cadres, all provinces have successively held enlarged organizational work conferences of the party to determine plans for transferring, training, and supplementing cadres. As of the end of June, more than half of the 4,000 cadres that Hebei Province decided to transfer had been gathered for training or had been transferred to factories and mines. Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces had concentrated all cadres transferred for training in early June. Pingyuan Province will complete the plan for transferring cadres in three phases before October. The first batch of more than 800 cadres transferred from Hebei and Shanxi provinces have arrived at the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Currently, the responsible comrades of the North China Bureau are giving them reports. Later, this group of cadres will be sent to Beijing and Tianjin and to the industrial leadership organs of North China.

    The reason why the task of transferring a large number of cadres could be completed so quickly and smoothly is first of all because party committees at all levels have done a good job in various ideological mobilization efforts: clarifying to cadres the importance of strengthening industrial construction and the prospects of national industrialization, clarifying that a crucial link in strengthening industrial construction is to cultivate a large number of industrial management talents, so that all party members, cadres, and non-party cadres understand that studying economic work, especially industrial work, is the most important revolutionary task at present, and they must be determined and confident in their studies. After such mobilization, the mood of the general cadres was very high, and they happily accepted this historic and glorious task. Secondly, the appropriate criticism of some narrow-minded and unpatriotic departmentalism ensured the smooth completion of the unified cadre transfer plan; at the same time, attention was paid to the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, the implementation of transfer, promotion, and supplementation, and other measures were taken as far as possible to minimize the impact on the work of various departments and regions. For example, while transferring cadres, Hebei Province made a plan to promote 7,300 cadres this year. Thirdly, institutions that could be streamlined were streamlined, and departments that could be merged were merged, which improved work efficiency and freed up cadres for transfer to industry. For the cadres who have been transferred to industry, preliminary training has been carried out to instill knowledge of the party and the state's industrial construction policies and necessary industrial management knowledge, and necessary ideological rectification has been carried out to consolidate their determination and confidence in turning to industry.

    In terms of promoting worker cadres, party committees in various places are also actively carrying out this work in a planned way and have achieved preliminary results. According to incomplete statistics from Shanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan provinces and Zhangjiakou City, more than 2,000 cadres have been promoted from the working masses; in Tianjin, seven systems including railways, posts and telecommunications, iron and steel, and textiles, promoted more than 600 section chiefs and heads of units by the end of April. The railway system not only made up for the vacancies but also exceeded the promotion plan by 90 percent. It is estimated that the entire region will promote 15,000 to 20,000 worker cadres this year. Some of these newly promoted worker cadres have already made outstanding achievements in their new positions, bringing a new atmosphere to the operation and management of state-owned enterprises. Their characteristics are that they have no bureaucratic style, consult with the masses on matters, always proceed from the interests of the state and the workers, have a high sense of responsibility and the spirit of overcoming difficulties, and understand production, and are good at grasping key points to solve problems. In the departments where they are in charge of leadership positions, the past practice of sitting in the office stamping seals has been greatly changed. They go deep into the workshops, use a pragmatic spirit, discover problems, come up with solutions, and begin to correct some of the routine but impractical and therefore harmful to the enterprise management system. Many cadres who are in charge of purchasing and sales personally lead staff to go out and conduct in-depth investigations among the masses, overcoming the difficulties in purchasing in some departments in the past and changing the situation of sluggish sales. For example, the worker cadres promoted to supply and marketing work at the Yangquan Iron Plant in Shanxi Province, after carefully analyzing the quality of various cokes, broke the past saying that "Taiyuan coke cannot be used for ironmaking," and solved the plant's annual coke supply problem, which can save the state 1.2 billion yuan. Experience has proved that cultivating and promoting worker cadres is the main way to cultivate a large number of industrial cadres, and it is also an important method to improve the management of state-owned enterprises, gradually eliminate bureaucracy in enterprise management, give full play to the enthusiasm of the working class, and closely connect leadership with the masses. Experience in various places has proved that when dealing with such an important matter as promoting worker cadres, on the one hand, we must oppose the one-sided view of qualifications and the erroneous idea of not actively and boldly promoting cadres under the pretext that "workers have low cultural levels, little leadership experience, cannot grasp the overall situation, and cannot do the job after being promoted," or the erroneous practice of letting them go after promotion without actively and responsibly helping them to become familiar with the business and solve difficulties; on the other hand, we must also oppose the phenomenon of casually promoting and padding numbers without careful examination. Combining bold promotion with careful selection, and combining mass recommendations with leadership review are the main methods for promoting cadres in various places. And more importantly, after promotion, the party's leadership must provide concrete and specific help in their work to improve their culture, familiarize themselves with the business, cultivate their leadership skills, care about and solve their various difficulties, and firmly support their correct style and protect their enthusiasm for progress, so that the quantity and quality of cadres promoted from the working masses can not only meet the needs of current work, but also support the many newly built state-owned enterprises in the future at any time.

    Due to the large number of old cadres who have initially transferred to industry and the many new cadres who have been promoted from the working masses, a question has been raised in the party's leadership in various factories and mines, that is, how to properly allocate and use the cadres who have initially transferred to industry, the newly promoted worker cadres, and the original factory and mine cadres, so that they can learn from each other, encourage each other, unite and cooperate, and contribute their strength in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign that is about to be fully launched, so as not to cause estrangement and mutual restraint. This is a problem that party leaders in various places should pay attention to and solve correctly.

    华北各地党组织抽调和提拔干部　加强工业建设的情况和体验
    为了切实加强以工业建设为中心的国家经济建设工作，中共中央华北局已在四月间决定从全区党委、人民团体系统中抽调近八千名干部转入工业建设工作，并从工人群众中提拔大批优秀分子担负工矿企业中的各项领导工作。华北各省市的党组织已采取一切必要的措施，执行此项重大的迫切的政治任务。
    在抽调干部方面，各省先后召开了扩大的党的组织工作会议，确定了抽调、训练、补充干部的计划。截至六月底止，河北省决定抽调的四千名干部已有半数以上集中起来进行训练或已调入厂矿。山西、察哈尔、绥远三省在六月初已将全数抽调出来的干部集中进行训练。平原省将于十月前分三期完成抽调干部的计划。河北、山西两省第一批外调干部八百余名已到达中共中央华北局。现在华北局负责同志正给他们作报告。以后，就把这批干部分送北京、天津两市和华北工业领导机关。
    这次大批抽调干部的任务所以能如此迅速顺利地完成，首先是由于各级党委做好了各项思想动员工作：在干部中讲清了加强工业建设的重要性和国家工业化的远景，讲清了加强工业建设的重要一环是造就大批工业管理人材，使所有党员干部和非党干部懂得学习经济工作特别是工业工作是当前一项最重要的革命工作，必须坚定学习的决心和信心。经过这样的动员以后，一般干部的情绪都十分高涨，愉快地接受了这项历史性的光荣任务。其次，适当地批判了某些不识大体、不顾全局的本位主义思想，保证了统一抽调干部计划的顺利完成；同时也注意了统筹兼顾、照顾全面的原则，实行了随调、随提、随补的办法，并采取其他各种措施，尽可能使各部门各地区的工作不受或少受影响。如河北省在抽调干部同时，作出了今年提拔七千三百名干部的计划。再次，是精简了可以精简的机构，合并了可以合并的部门，这样就提高了工作效率，得以腾出干部转入工业。对于已被抽调转入工业的干部，都分别进行了初步的训练，灌输了党和国家的工业建设政策知识和必要的工业管理知识，进行了必要的思想整顿，巩固了他们转向工业的决心和信心。
    在提拔工人干部方面，各地党委也正有计划地积极进行，并获得了初步成绩。据山西、河北、绥远三省和张家口市的不完全统计，目前已在工人群众中提拔干部二千余名；天津市铁路、邮电、钢铁、纺织等七个系统，四月底已提拔科、股长六百余名。铁路系统不但补足了缺额，并且超过提拔计划数的百分之九十。估计全区今年提拔工人干部可达一万五千名至两万名。这些新提拔的工人干部，有些已在新的工作岗位上有了出色的成绩，给国家企业的经营管理带来了新的气象。他们的特点是没有官僚主义作风，有事和群众商量，时时从国家利益和工人利益出发，有高度的责任心和克服困难的精神，并且懂得生产，善于抓住关键解决问题。在他们担负领导职务的部门，过去专坐在办公室里盖图章的风气大大改变了。他们深入车间，用实事求是的精神，发现问题，想出解决办法，开始纠正了过去某些例行的但是不切实际因而有害于企业管理的制度。许多担负采买和销售工作的干部，亲自带领工作人员外出，深入群众进行调查，克服了某些部门过去采购方面的困难，并改变了销售不畅的局面。如山西省阳泉铁厂提拔做供销工作的工人干部，在仔细地分析了各种焦炭的质量之后，打破了过去“太原焦炭不能炼铁”的说法，解决了该厂全年焦炭的供应问题，可给国家节约十二亿元。经验证明：培养和提拔工人干部，是造就大批工业干部的主要办法，也是改进国家企业管理、逐步消除企业管理中的官僚主义、充分发挥工人阶级的积极性、密切领导和群众联系的重要方法。各地经验证明：对待提拔工人干部这样一件重要事情，必须一方面反对片面的资历观点和藉口“工人文化低，领导经验少，不能掌握全面，提起来干不了”，因而不去积极大胆地提拔的错误思想，或提拔起来听之任之，不去积极负责地帮助他们熟习业务，解决困难的错误作法；另一方面也要反对不经过慎重审查而随便提拔、滥竽充数的现象。大胆提拔和慎重选择相结合，群众的推荐和领导方面的审查相结合，这就是目前各地提拔干部的主要方法。而更重要的问题，是在提拔起来以后，党的领导方面必须在工作中切实具体地帮助他们提高文化，熟习业务，培养他们的领导能力，关心和解决他们的各种困难，并坚决支持他们的正确作风，保护他们前进的热情，以使在工人群众中提拔起来的干部的数量和质量，不但能够满足当前工作的需要，而且能够随时支援将来许多新建的国家企业。
    由于大批老干部初次转入工业和从工人群众中提拔了许多新干部，目前在各厂矿党的领导方面就提出了一个问题，即如何把初次转入工业的干部和新提拔的工人干部以及原有的厂矿干部配备得当，使用得当，使他们互学互勉，团结合作，在行将全面展开的爱国增产节约竞赛运动中，都能贡献自己的力量，而不致彼此发生隔阂，互相牵制。这是各地党的领导同志应该重视并应正确解决的问题。
