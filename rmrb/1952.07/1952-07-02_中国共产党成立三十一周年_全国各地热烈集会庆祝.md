Xinhua News Agency report: Various regions across the country warmly celebrated the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on "July 1st" and the days leading up to it.

    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a grand commemorative meeting on June 30th. Lin Feng delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Communist Party of China not only led and organized the Chinese people to win the victory of the revolutionary war but also led and organized the Chinese people to win the victory of economic construction. Economic construction is a new subject for us. But difficulties have not frightened us. We have not only restored and transformed the people's economy at a relatively rapid pace but also begun to understand what we did not understand in the past and learned how to do what we could not do in the past. Lin Feng said: The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have prepared new conditions for us to carry out large-scale economic construction. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, deeply develop the patriotic production increase and thrift movement, and greet the upcoming upsurge of large-scale economic construction. Every Communist Party member must use their exemplary actions to stand at the forefront of completing the national economic plan and carrying out the production increase and thrift movement. All party cadres in the Northeast must earnestly study economic work. At the same time, in order to successfully lead the cause of national economic construction, all party members must strengthen theoretical study. All party members with reading ability must formulate practical and feasible plans for studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and ensure persistent perseverance so as to further establish a regular learning system within the party organization in the Northeast in a step-by-step manner. On "July 1st," the first-level organs of the Northeast and the Shenyang municipal level held separate commemorative meetings to convey Lin Feng's report. Party propagandists and reporters in each unit, taking the commemoration of "July 1st" as the content, combined the promotion of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to further mobilize the development of the patriotic production increase and thrift movement.

    The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee held a celebration meeting on the morning of June 30th. Comrade Chen Yi delivered a report at the meeting. Chen Yi pointed out that the great achievements of New China prove that the Communist Party of China is capable of undertaking the arduous task of leading China's construction. He said: In order to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Party, we must strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, organize forces, and support the Korean front. We must force U.S. imperialism to resolve the Korean issue fairly and reasonably, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal. Chen Yi outlined the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. He said: The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements are a great social democratic reform movement. Through this movement, our party, government, and army have been purified, and people from all walks of life have received profound education. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have laid the foundation for China's construction and provided a guarantee for victory. He called on everyone to carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift movement and the ideological remolding movement on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and to greet the upcoming large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. Factories, organs, organizations, schools, and neighborhood committees in Shanghai also held commemorative meetings and symposiums.

Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered a report at the meeting. After pointing out the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and their profound impact on China's construction, he said: "In the second half of this year, state-owned and public-owned factories and mines must, on the basis of the victory of the 'Three-Anti' movement, respond to Chairman Mao's call, implement the decision of the North China Industrial Production Competition Conference, and fully launch the patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement, striving not only to complete the annual production plan but also to further increase production and save 8 trillion yuan for the country. At the same time, through competition, promote production improvement, lay the initial foundation for the implementation of a comprehensive economic accounting system, and rapidly accumulate experience, learn to manage industry, and greet the upcoming high tide of large-scale economic construction." To this end, Liu Ren pointed out that several tasks must be done well: First, do a good job in mobilizing the masses. Second, vigorously promote and summarize advanced experiences and advanced working methods. Third, strengthen ideological and political education and propaganda and mobilization work in the competition movement. Fourth, it must be made clear to every worker that "improving quality and reducing costs" is an important part of the patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement, and this issue is especially important for Beijing. Fifth, effectively solve the safety production and health care work of workers, and reasonably solve the living and welfare of workers. At the same time, the reward system should be improved so that all workers who have achievements and contributions can receive the spiritual and material rewards they deserve in a timely manner. Sixth, carry out investigation and determination work in a planned and step-by-step manner; establish a workshop cost system, and lay the initial foundation for the implementation of an economic accounting system. Seventh, in order to unify and deeply lead this large-scale production increase and thrift competition movement, in addition to preparing for the establishment of a patriotic production increase and thrift movement committee in the city, factory directors or managers of various factories and mines are required to personally handle the work of one workshop, and each workshop director must personally handle the work of one group. At the same time, in order to adapt to large-scale economic construction, various units are required to vigorously promote activists among workers to leadership positions. Liu Ren finally pointed out that party consolidation and party building work must be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the study of Marxist-Leninist theory must be strengthened. He said: "The best way to commemorate the Party's birthday is to complete the great and glorious tasks given to us by the Party, and to commemorate the 31st anniversary of our Party's founding with practical actions—launching the patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement and the party consolidation and party building work."
