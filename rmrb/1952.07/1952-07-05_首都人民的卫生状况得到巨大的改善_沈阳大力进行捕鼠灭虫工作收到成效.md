    The patriotic health campaign in Beijing has now become a widespread and in-depth mass movement. Hundreds of thousands of citizens, students, and staff from factories and government offices, as well as medical workers, have participated in this movement. As of June 20th, the city had captured over 460,000 rats and blocked over 443,000 rat holes; it had eliminated over 59 million flies and over 430 million fly pupae (based on statistics up to June 10th). In addition, feces have been cleared and toilets improved. According to incomplete statistics, over 68,000 cesspools in the city have been newly covered with wooden lids, and over 17,000 cesspools have been deepened. In terms of mosquito control, the city has filled in over 11,000 puddles, blocked over 49,500 tree holes, and eliminated over 274,000 square meters of mosquito breeding grounds. Nearly 20,000 dogs have been captured in the suburban areas, and dogs in the urban area have basically been eradicated. Unified management has been implemented for food and beverage and unhygienic industries. One hundred and forty-two stores selling unclean food and beverages have been shut down. Food and beverage businesses have added fly and mosquito prevention equipment such as glass covers and gauze covers. Industry health organizations have been established in the city's food stores, stalls, vegetable markets, sauce shops, etc., implementing democratic management and conducting regular inspections. Certain industries, such as chemical industries with offensive odors, have improved their hygiene and disinfection equipment. Some industries, such as the blood material industry and bone scraping industry, are preparing to relocate.
  The reason why Beijing's patriotic health campaign has achieved such great success is mainly due to the extensive mobilization of all possible forces, the adoption of diverse forms of propaganda, and the mobilization of the masses to participate in this movement through patriotic health publicity. The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and the Municipal Science and Technology Popularization Association mobilized a large number of housewives and scientific workers to participate in the publicity work. Many street youths enthusiastically participated in the explanation and service work of the epidemic prevention and health picture exhibitions held in various districts. More than 16,000 students from universities and middle schools organized propaganda teams and went deep into various streets and alleys to publicize health knowledge to the masses.
    Through this movement, the level of health knowledge of the masses in Beijing has been greatly improved, the health conditions of the capital have been improved, and the health of the people of the capital has been guaranteed. The most significant effect is that diseases have been greatly reduced this year, and the number of people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases is much less than last year.
   [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] Shenyang City is vigorously carrying out rat extermination and pest control in the in-depth patriotic health movement. According to preliminary statistics from mid-to-late May, more than 152,000 rats, more than 1,400 catties of flies, and more than 2,000 catties of other insects have been captured and killed. In order to eliminate the breeding of mosquito larvae, insecticides were sprayed in an area of more than 4.73 million square meters in twelve locations throughout the city. According to a post-event survey, 80% of all mosquito larvae in the water in these locations had been killed. The city also filled in thirteen sewage ditches that could breed mosquito larvae, and cleared weeds around houses covering an area of more than 800,000 square meters. More than 11,900 lidded garbage bins and more than 10,000 sanitary toilets have been newly installed throughout the city.
    Because cadres at all levels of districts and streets have gone deep into the masses to conduct continuous propaganda, the vast majority of citizens have generally increased their health knowledge and have actively participated in rat extermination and pest control work. The farmers in the suburban districts generally put forward the slogans of "three clean" (clean bed surface, clean corners of walls, clean room) "five eliminations" (eliminate flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, bedbugs) and "three pads" (pad cabinets, pad granaries, pad firewood stacks). Residents of Sujiatun town in the suburbs combined rat extermination with a weeding campaign. Residents of various streets in the Nanshi District of the city have also formulated family and personal rat extermination and pest control plans. Teachers and students of the 19th Middle School in the city formed a "rat extermination combat team" and captured more than 2,000 wild rats in ten days. The Beishi District also implemented the method of "key encirclement and suppression" in rat extermination. They concentrated twenty-five rat traps at the Oriental Chicken Farm on Yingfang Street and caught thirty rats in one night.
    The masses throughout the city have many inventions and creations in rat extermination and pest control. For example, residents of the Beiguan District created more than 70 kinds of insect catching devices, and some of the insect catching devices have been promoted throughout the district. The rat trap created by the 15th Middle School in the suburbs was promoted in rural areas, and more than 16,000 rats were caught in twenty days. Now, the city will compare and study these rat catching and insect catching devices created by the masses, and has selected sixteen kinds of more effective rat catching and insect catching devices to be promoted throughout the city.
    After this rat extermination and pest control campaign, the flies, mosquitoes, and rats in the city have been greatly reduced compared with previous years. Many model streets and residents' groups have emerged in the city in the work of rat extermination and pest control. Thirty-six residents' groups in Dadong District have won the honorary title of "Fly-Free Group". Housheng Street and Zhujianlu Street in Beishi District have been rated as model streets; and twenty-one residents' groups have been rated as model residents' groups.

    首都人民的卫生状况得到巨大的改善
    沈阳大力进行捕鼠灭虫工作收到成效
    【本报讯】北京市爱国卫生运动，目前已形成一个广泛深入的群众运动。成千成万的市民、学生和工厂、机关的工作人员以及医务工作者，参加了这一运动。到六月二十日为止，全市共捕捉老鼠四十六万多只，堵塞鼠洞四十四万三千多个；消灭苍蝇五千九百多万只，消灭苍蝇蛹四亿三千多万个（根据截至六月十日的统计）。此外，又清除了粪便，改善了厕所，据不完全的统计，全市六万八千多个粪坑新加了木盖；有一万七千多个粪坑增加了深度。在灭蚊方面，全市已填平水坑一万一千多个；堵塞树洞四万九千五百多个，消灭了孑孓滋生的处所二十七万四千多平方公尺。城郊区共捕犬将近两万只，目前城区的犬已基本肃清。对饮食物和有碍卫生的行业，实行统一管理，取缔了贩卖不洁饮食物的店铺一百四十二家；饮食行业添设了防蝇防蚊的设备如玻璃罩、纱罩等。全市饮食店铺、摊贩、菜市场、酱园等，都建立了行业卫生组织，实行民主管理，经常进行检查。某些行业如有恶臭气味的化学工业，都改进了卫生和消毒设备；有些行业如血料业、刮骨业等，则正在进行迁移的准备。
  北京市爱国卫生运动取得如此巨大成绩的原因，主要是由于广泛地动员了一切可能动员的力量，采用多种多样的宣传方式，向广大群众进行了爱国卫生的宣传，发动群众参加这一运动。北京市民主妇女联合会、市科学技术普及协会，发动大批家庭妇女和科学工作者参加宣传工作；许多街道青年踊跃地参加了各区所举办的有关防疫卫生图片展览的讲解和服务工作。大、中学校的学生一万六千多人，组织了宣传队，深入各街道、胡同，向群众宣传卫生常识。
    通过这一运动，大大地提高了北京市广大人民群众的卫生知识水平，改善了首都的卫生状况，也保障了首都人民的健康。最显著的效果是：今年疾病大大地减少了，患肠胃病的人数比去年要少得多。
   【新华社沈阳四日电】沈阳市在深入开展爱国卫生运动中大力进行捕鼠灭虫工作。据全市五月中、下旬的初步统计，已捕灭老鼠十五万二千多只，苍蝇一千四百多斤，其他昆虫二千多斤。为了杜绝蚊虫幼虫孑孓的繁殖，全市在十二处场所四百七十三万余平方米的面积内喷洒了杀虫油剂。据事后调查，这些场所的积水中所有孑孓已被杀死百分之八十。全市还填平了可能繁殖孑孓的污水沟十三处；清除房屋周围的杂草面积达八十余万平方米。全市新添置了一万一千九百余个有盖的垃圾桶，和一万余个合乎卫生标准的厕所。
    由于各级区、街干部深入群众不断进行宣传，广大市民普遍增加了卫生常识，都积极地参加捕鼠灭虫工作。市郊各区农民普遍提出“三光”（炕面光、墙角光、室内光）、“五灭”（灭蝇、灭蚊、灭蚤、灭虱、灭臭虫）、“三垫”（垫柜、垫粮囤、垫柴草垛）的口号。市郊苏家屯镇的居民结合捕鼠工作开展了除草运动。市内南市区各街居民还订立了家庭和个人的捕鼠灭虫计划。市内第十九中学师生组成“捕鼠战斗小组”，在十天内共捕野鼠二千多只。北市区在捕鼠中还实行了“重点围剿”的办法。他们在营房街东方养鸡场集中了二十五个捕鼠器，一夜就捕捉了三十只老鼠。
    全市群众在捕鼠灭虫中有许多发明创造。如北关区的居民创造了七十多种捕虫器具，有的捕虫器已在全区推广。市郊第十五中学创造的捕鼠器，在农村推广后，二十天内共打了一万六千多只老鼠。现在，该市将这些群众创造的捕鼠捕虫器具加以比较、研究后，已选出较有效的捕鼠捕虫器具各十六种，准备在全市推广。
    经过这次捕鼠灭虫运动，市内的苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠已比往年大为减少。全市涌现出很多在捕鼠灭虫工作上的模范街道和居民组。大东区有三十六个居民组荣获了“无蝇组”的光荣称号。北市区的厚生街和朱剪炉街已被评为模范街道；还有二十一个居民组被评为模范居民组。
