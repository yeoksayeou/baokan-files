Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: A partial lunar eclipse will occur on August 6th, and will be visible throughout the country. According to predictions by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a partial lunar eclipse will be visible across the country on August 6th, occurring before sunrise on the 6th. According to the East longitude 120 degree standard time (i.e., what is usually called Beijing time), the beginning of this lunar eclipse will be at 2:33 AM (the upper left part of the moon begins to be eclipsed), the maximum eclipse will be at 3:47 AM (the maximum eclipsed portion accounts for 54% of the moon's diameter); and the eclipse will end at 5:01 AM. The entire process will last two hours and twenty-nine minutes.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth, and moon are in a straight line during the full moon (usually the 15th day of the lunar month). The moon moves into the earth's shadow and cannot receive sunlight, causing it to turn dark. If the moon completely enters the earth's shadow, the entire moon becomes dark, which is called a total lunar eclipse. This time, only part of the moon will enter the earth's shadow, which is called a partial lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse is a natural phenomenon and its occurrence is regular. Scientific methods can be used to accurately calculate the time of a lunar eclipse in advance.

    八月六日全国可见月偏食
    【新华社二十八日讯】八月六日将发生月偏食。根据中国科学院紫金山天文台预测，八月六日有一次全国各地都可以看到的月偏食，时间是在六日的日出前。按照东经一二○度标准时（即通常所称的北京时间），这次月食的开始是在二时三十三分（月亮左偏上的部分开始被食），三时四十七分食甚
    （最大食分占月亮直径的百分之五十四）；在五时零一分复圆。全部过程是两小时又二十九分。
    按月食就是在望（通常多是阴历十五日）的时候，太阳，地球，月亮的位置都在一条直线上，月亮走到地球背后的影子里受不到阳光而变为黑暗的现象。如果月亮完全走进地球影子时月亮的全部都变为黑暗那就叫做月全食；这一次，月亮只有一部分走进地球影子中间，这叫做月偏食。月食是一种自然现象，它的发生是有规律的，用科学的方法即可事先把月食时间准确地计算出来。
