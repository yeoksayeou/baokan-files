    Commenting on the Year-Long Korean Armistice Negotiations
    The Korean armistice negotiations, which concern every family in the world, have been going on for a year. Here, we would first like to extend our sincere respect to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army armistice negotiation delegation, who have persevered in the negotiations with wisdom and patience and achieved basic results in the year-long negotiation struggle, and express our warm support for their persistent efforts to strive for an armistice in Korea and strive for peace.
    The year-long Korean armistice negotiations vividly demonstrate that this is a fierce struggle waged by the forces of peace against the forces of aggression in order to win peace. In this struggle, in order to satisfy the urgent demand of the people of the world for an armistice in Korea, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently adhered to reason, insisted on consultation, upheld the dignity of international law and humanitarian principles, and advocated the rapid advancement of negotiations and the conclusion of an armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis; while the US side, in order to maintain world tension, has been unreasonable from the beginning, obstructed negotiations, disregarded the solemn provisions of international conventions, violated humanitarian principles, and even refused to consult and refused to meet, attempting to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations in order to expand the war. The year-long negotiation struggle shows that although the US delaying policy has caused the negotiations to last for a year without reaching a final agreement, it is only because the Korean and Chinese sides have insisted on negotiations and insisted on solving problems on a fair and reasonable basis that many problems in the negotiations have been solved. This is a major achievement that the forces of peace have won in this regard in the past year. The arrogant goal of the US aggressors in launching the aggressive war against Korea at the risk of their lives was to turn the entire Korea into a base for expanding their aggressive war and to threaten peace in the Far East and Asia. This act of aggression by the US imperialists suffered a shameful defeat under the strong blows of the armed forces of the Korean and Chinese people; therefore, under the great pressure of the world's people demanding a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the United States was forced to accept the proposal of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, to begin the Korean armistice negotiations. However, on the other hand, since the realization of an armistice in Korea would be greatly detrimental to their policy of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and intensifying the world situation, the US side deliberately complicated the issues during the negotiations, even though there were not many issues to begin with, and they could have been easily resolved, in order to facilitate its policy of delaying the negotiations. First of all, on the issue of the military demarcation line, the US side initially attempted to draw the military demarcation line into our hinterland,妄想 from the negotiating table to occupy 12,000 square kilometers of our territory, and obtain what they could not obtain by military force. Then, on the issue of supervising the guarantee of the armistice, the US side insisted on rear inspections and stubbornly insisted on its unreasonable demand to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting the construction of airports. In the course of the negotiations, the audacious US aggressors, after the successive failures of their so-called summer offensive and autumn offensive, launched an unprecedented large-scale bacteriological warfare in an attempt to threaten our side. However, in the great and sustained struggle of the great Chinese and Korean people to resolutely stop the bacteriological warfare, this threat from the United States failed again, and the problems in the negotiations still had to be solved in the negotiations. Because our side steadfastly attacked the US side's various unreasonable demands at the negotiating table, and forced the US side to negotiate with us on a fair and reasonable basis, resolving many of the trivial issues deliberately created by the US side, therefore, one year after the start of the armistice negotiations, several major issues in the entire armistice negotiations have been basically agreed upon. What remains is the issue of prisoner repatriation in the prisoner of war issue. Because the US side has always refused to abandon its sinister proposition of detaining a large number of prisoners of war, this issue has been discussed since December 11 last year, and it has been seven months now, but it has still not been resolved and is still in a stalemate.
    Originally, after the armistice, it was a matter of course for both sides to repatriate all the prisoners they had taken in. In the history of international warfare for two hundred years, no country has failed to do so. All international laws, especially the Geneva Convention of 1949, which the US government personally participated in formulating, stipulate this more solemnly. The Geneva Convention not only clearly stipulates in Article 118 that prisoners of war must be unconditionally repatriated after the armistice, but also, in order to prevent the detaining party from detaining prisoners of war under the pretext of detaining them, Article 7 further stipulates that prisoners of war may not renounce their right to be repatriated. In accordance with the spirit of this convention, in the armistice negotiations, both sides had already reached an agreement to guarantee that prisoners of war would not participate in the Korean War after repatriation, so that prisoners of war could return home to live a peaceful life. However, the US government brazenly violated the Geneva Convention that it had personally formulated, violated the agreement it had already agreed to, and stubbornly insisted on the so-called "non-forcible repatriation" or "voluntary repatriation," and in reality, it was to detain prisoners of war and send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandits to serve as cannon fodder. If the US's proposition is allowed to succeed, then all international agreements and all international laws will be completely destroyed by them under their aggressive needs. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese and Korean people, and this is absolutely not allowed by the people of the world.
    The US aggressors say that they want to detain prisoners of war out of humanitarian considerations. May I ask what is more humanitarian for prisoners of war than to send them home, reunite them with their families, and restore a peaceful life? The real humanitarian principle is to repatriate all prisoners of war in accordance with our proposition and guarantee that they will return home to live a peaceful life. However, the US side not only refuses to do so, but also, in order to achieve their goal of detaining prisoners of war, further violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention and uses the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandits to illegally conduct so-called "screenings" of prisoners of war without any basis. In the "screening," the US side wantonly slaughtered prisoners of war on a large scale, forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, forced prisoners of war to write blood letters, and put blood fingerprints on them, and even after the prisoners of war were knocked unconscious, pulled the prisoners of war's hands to put fingerprints on them or shamelessly put fingerprints on them to impersonate the fingerprints of prisoners of war. This is completely a sinful act of trampling on the freedom of will and personal rights of prisoners of war to demand to return home to live a peaceful life, and this is completely incompatible with humanitarian principles.
    After they carried out this bloody "screening," the US side then further broke its promise and openly abandoned the fact that they had admitted that the number of 116,000 prisoners was likely to be close to the number of exchanged prisoners, and said a completely absurd number that 70,000 people would be repatriated. After putting forward this completely unreasonable and completely absurd number, the US negotiators arrogantly declared that the plan they put forward was "firm, final, and unchangeable." Since then, the US aggressors have adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate for two months, and even repeatedly adjourned the meeting unilaterally and left the meeting place, hoping to force our side to submit with this unreasonable attitude. When these methods they adopted could not achieve their goal, the US side wantonly bombed the peaceful construction of the Yalu River power plant, attempting to use so-called military pressure to obtain what they could not get in the negotiations. But everyone knows that the military pressure of the US aggressors, including their bacteriological warfare, has already gone bankrupt one after another under the strong blows of the great Chinese and Korean people. The well-trained Chinese and Korean people, who have defeated the US aggressors in the Korean War for more than two years, will never be frightened by the so-called military pressure of the US aggressors. If the US side insists on using so-called military pressure, then they will inevitably suffer a greater lesson that they deserve.
    Now that the US side has failed in all kinds of delays and military pressure, it has turned to expressing its willingness to use consultations to obtain a "solution that meets the requirements of both sides to a reasonable extent." We welcome this attitude of the US side. We have pointed out that the armistice negotiations have solved many problems in the past year. In equal negotiations between the two sides, the solution of all these problems cannot be achieved according to the unilateral demands of one side. On the contrary, the solution of each problem in the past can only be achieved if it meets the requirements of both sides. What remains now is only the issue of repatriation in the prisoner of war issue. Regarding this issue, both sides have already reached a principled agreement on Article 51 of the armistice agreement, that is, "When this armistice agreement comes into effect, all prisoners captured by each side shall as soon as possible be released and repatriated. The release and repatriation of these prisoners shall be carried out in accordance with the list exchanged and corrected by both sides before the signing of this armistice agreement." At the same time, both sides have also agreed on Article 52, that is, the principle of guaranteeing that prisoners of war on both sides will not participate in the Korean War after repatriation, so that they can return home to live a peaceful life. There is already a reasonable basis for solving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation based on these principles. But despite the fact that both sides have a basis for agreement in principle, the US side has consistently adhered to its unilateral demands on this issue, and, at the same time that the US side has expressed its willingness to negotiate a "solution that meets the requirements of both sides to a reasonable extent," the US side is still carrying out illegal actions to unilaterally handle prisoners of war. This clearly shows that the US side's so-called "meeting the requirements of both sides to a reasonable extent" does not in any way indicate that the US side has the sincerity to solve the problem. The US side is obviously still taking unilateral actions based on their unilateral and unreasonable demands, attempting to delay the negotiations or even destroy the negotiations in order to facilitate their expansion of armaments, preparation for war, maintenance of international tension, and expansion of the war. The Chinese and Korean people have long been fully vigilant about this conspiracy of the US imperialists. We will resolutely oppose this conspiracy of the US aggressors, and we will fight for the Korean armistice that the people of the world yearn for, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal.

    评一年来的朝鲜停战谈判
    全世界一切家庭所关心的朝鲜停战谈判已经进行了一周年了。在这里，我们首先要向在一年来的谈判斗争中以智慧和耐心坚持谈判、并取得了基本成就的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团致衷忱的敬意，并对他们争取朝鲜停战、争取和平的持久努力表示热烈的支持。
    一年来的朝鲜停战谈判，生动地表示了这是和平势力对侵略势力为了争取和平而进行的一场激烈斗争。在这场斗争中，朝中方面为了满足全世界人民对于朝鲜停战的迫切要求，自始至终，坚持说理，坚持协商，坚持国际法规的尊严和人道的原则，主张在公平合理的基础上迅速推进谈判，达成停战协议；而美国方面则为了保持世界紧张局势，一开始就蛮不讲理，阻挠谈判，蔑视国际公约的庄严规定，违反人道的原则，甚至拒绝协商，拒绝开会，企图依靠这一切来拖延并破坏朝鲜停战谈判，以便扩大战争。一年来的谈判斗争说明了虽然由于美国的拖延政策使谈判进行了一年之久还不能达成最后的协议，但是由于朝中方面坚持谈判，并坚持在公平合理的基础上解决问题，才能使谈判中许多问题得以解决。这是一年来和平势力在这方面所赢得的重大的成就。美国侵略者冒险发动侵朝战争的狂妄目的，是要变整个朝鲜为其扩大侵略战争的基地，并威胁远东和亚洲的和平。美帝国主义者的这一侵略行动，在朝中人民武装力量的坚强打击之下，遭受了可耻的失败；因而，在世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的重大压力之下，美国被迫接受了苏联驻联合国代表马立克的建议，来开始朝鲜停战谈判。但是，另一方面，由于朝鲜停战的实现将对他们的扩军备战、紧张世界局势的政策大为不利，因此在谈判的过程中，虽然问题本来不多，并且是本来可以很容易地加以解决的，然而美方却故意要使问题复杂化，以利于它实行拖延谈判的政策。首先，在军事分界线的问题上，美方始而企图将军事分界线划入我方腹地，妄想从谈判桌上占领我方一万二千方公里土地，取得他们用军事力量所不能取得的东西。跟着，在保证停战的监督问题上，美方又坚持后方视察，并蛮横地坚持其干涉我方内政的限制修建机场的无理主张。在谈判的过程中，胆大妄为的美国侵略者并在他们的所谓夏季攻势、秋季攻势相继失败之后，发动了前所未有的大规模细菌战，企图以此来威胁我方。但在伟大的中朝两国人民坚决制止细菌战的巨大而持久的斗争中，美国这一威胁又归失败，谈判中的问题还是要在谈判中来解决。由于我方在谈判桌上坚定不移地打击了美方种种无理要求，并在公平合理的基础上迫使美方来和我方协商，解决了美方所故意制造的许多枝节问题，因此，在停战谈判开始一年后的今天，全部停战谈判中的几个主要问题都已经基本上达成了协议。剩下来的就是战俘问题中的一个遣俘问题。由于美方始终不肯放弃其大批扣留战俘的罪恶主张，这个问题自去年十二月十一日谈起，至今已经七个月之久，还是不能解决，还是在僵持之中。
    本来，停战以后，双方遣返其所收容的全部俘虏是天经地义的事。在两百年来的国际战争史上，没有一个国家不加以奉行。一切国际法规，特别是一九四九年为美国政府所亲自参加制定的日内瓦公约，对此更郑重加以规定。日内瓦公约不仅在一百一十八条中明确规定在停战后必须无条件遣返双方战俘，并且为防止收容一方借口扣留战俘，在第七条中更进一步规定战俘不得放弃其被遣返的权利。根据这个公约的精神，在停战谈判中，双方早已成立协议，保证战俘遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争，以便战俘回家过和平生活。可是美国政府竟悍然破坏它所亲手制定的日内瓦公约，违反它自己已经同意的协议，蛮横坚持所谓“不能强迫遣返”或“自愿遣返”，而实际上是要扣留战俘送交蒋介石、李承晚匪帮充当炮灰的主张。美国的这一主张如果任其得逞，则所有的国际协议，所有的国际法规都将在其侵略需要之下，被他们彻底破坏。这是中朝人民所绝对不能容忍的，这也是全世界人民所绝对不能容许的。
    美国侵略者说他们之所以要扣留战俘是为了人道的立场。试问对于战俘有什么比遣送他们回家、与其家人团聚、恢复和平生活更是人道的呢？真正的人道原则是应该依照我方主张，遣返全部战俘，保证其回家过和平生活。可是美方非但不肯这样做，并且为了达到他们扣留战俘的目的，进一步违反日内瓦公约的规定，使用蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的特务，非法地对战俘进行毫无根据的所谓“甄别”。在“甄别”中，美方竟肆意大批屠杀战俘，强迫在战俘身上刺字，强迫战俘写血书，盖血指印，甚至在战俘被打昏了之后，拉战俘的手去盖指印或竟无耻地自盖指印来冒充战俘的指迹。这完全是蹂躏战俘要求回家过和平生活的自由意志和个人权利的罪恶行为，这完全是与人道原则绝对不能相容的。
    在他们进行了这种血腥的“甄别”之后，美方于是进一步背信弃义，公然背弃了他们曾经承认过十一万六千俘虏可能接近于交换俘虏的数字的大小这一事实，而说出了一个绝顶荒谬的所谓七万人将要被遣返的数字。在提出了这个完全无理、完全荒谬的数字之后，美方谈判代表竟狂妄地声言他们提出的这一个方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”。自此以后，美国侵略者有两个月之久，一直采取拒绝协商的态度，甚至屡次片面中途休会，离开会场，希图用这种不讲理的态度来逼使我方屈服。在他们所采用的这些办法都不能达到目的之时，美方又对鸭绿江发电厂的和平建设狂轰乱炸，企图以所谓军事压力来取得他们在谈判中所不能得到的东西。但是人人知道，美国侵略者的军事压力，包括他们的细菌战在内，在伟大的中朝人民的坚强打击之下，早已是一个接一个地破产了。久经锻炼的、已经在两年多以来的朝鲜战争中击败了美国侵略者的中朝人民是绝对不会为美国侵略者的所谓军事压力骇倒的。如果美方一定要用所谓军事压力，那么，他们就必然要受到他们应得的更大教训。
    现在，美方在种种拖延和军事压力都已失败之后，转而表示了要用协商来取得一个“在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”。美方这种态度是我们所欢迎的。我们已经指出过，停战谈判在过去一年中，已经解决了不少问题。在双方对等的谈判中，所有这些问题的解决，都不可能根据一方片面的要求而取得。正相反，过去每一个问题的解决，都是适合了双方的要求才能取得协议的。目前所剩下的只是战俘问题中的一个遣返问题。关于这个问题，双方并已经取得了停战协定第五十一款的原则协议，即“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之”。同时，双方也已协议了第五十二款，即保证双方战俘遣返后，不参加朝鲜战争，以便他们回家过和平生活的原则。根据这些原则来解决战俘遣返问题，已经有了合理的基础。但尽管双方已经有了协议原则的基础，美国方面在这个问题上，却一贯坚持其片面的要求，而且，就在美方表示要协商一个“在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”的同时，美方还正在进行片面处理战俘的非法行动。这显然表示美方所谓“在合理程度上适合双方要求”的说法，丝毫不能说明美方有解决问题的诚意。美方显然还是在根据他们的片面无理要求来采取片面行动，企图借此拖延谈判，甚至破坏谈判，以便于其扩军备战，保持国际紧张局势，并扩大战争。中朝人民对于美帝国主义者的这种阴谋早已有了充分的警惕。我们将坚决反对美国侵略者这一阴谋，并为了全世界人民所渴望实现的朝鲜停战而斗争，不达目的，决不休止。
