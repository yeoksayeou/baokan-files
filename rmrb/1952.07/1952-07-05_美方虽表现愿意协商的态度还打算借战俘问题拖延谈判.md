Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 4th. In the meeting tent at Panmunjom on July 1st, the US negotiation representative Harrison, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly became active. Reversing his attitude of refusing to reason and negotiate for the past two months, he delivered a long speech expressing his willingness to negotiate. Even the Associated Press reporter at Panmunjom admitted in his report on July 1st that "the chief representative of the Allied forces changed his pace." Harrison stated that they "sincerely seek an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea." He acknowledged our consistent view on the armistice negotiations, that "the only remaining issue in the armistice negotiations is the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war," and said that the solution to the POW issue "must be a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides," and no longer claimed that their proposal was "firm, final, and unchangeable."

In his speech, Harrison spent a great deal of time explaining Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement regarding the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war. This article states: "All prisoners of war held by each side at the time of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible. Such release and repatriation of prisoners of war shall be effected in conformity with the lists exchanged and checked by both sides prior to the signing of this Armistice Agreement." We have consistently advocated and agreed to this article. However, the result of the so-called corrected list put forward by the US side on April 19th does not conform to this article. At the same time, Harrison also acknowledged that prisoners of war "should be allowed to return home to live peaceful lives," and believed that exchanging prisoners of war so that they can return home to live peaceful lives is "a rational and humanitarian act that reflects the credibility of both sides," and "here is a reasonable basis for reaching a ceasefire agreement." This is obviously a change in the US approach. In the past, the US side dared not mention the words that prisoners of war should be repatriated home to live peaceful lives.

However, in Harrison's speech on July 1st, although he showed a willingness to negotiate that had been absent for two months, thus giving some hope for the advancement of the negotiations, he also said that "any negotiation seeking our agreement to forcibly repatriate prisoners of war is futile." From this, people can see that although the US side wants to solve the problem with a negotiating attitude on the one hand, due to various reasons at home and abroad, they are still unwilling to abandon their intention to delay negotiations and intensify the situation under the pretext of the prisoner of war issue. The Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world should pay close attention to this.

### 美方虽表现愿意协商的态度还打算借战俘问题拖延谈判

    美方虽表现愿意协商的态度还打算借战俘问题拖延谈判
    【新华社开城四日电】七月一日的板门店会议帐篷里，一向无话可说的美方谈判代表哈利逊忽然活动起来。他一反他两个月来拒绝说理，拒绝协商的态度，发表了一大段愿意协商的谈话，连美联社在板门店记者七月一日的报道也承认“联军首席代表改换了步调”。哈利逊表示他们“诚意地觅求停战，以终止在朝鲜的流血”。他承认了我方一向对停战谈判的看法，即停战谈判“唯一余下的问题就是遣返战俘的问题”，并说战俘问题的解决方案，“必须是一个在合理的程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，而不再讲什么他们的方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”的了。
  哈利逊在发言中，花了很大时间来解释停战协定草案第五十一款关于释放和遣返全部战俘的原则条文。这一款说：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。”这一条文我方向来是主张并且同意的。但问题是美方在四月十九日提出来的所谓校正的名单的结果，并不符合于这个条文。哈利逊同时又承认战俘“应被允许回家过和平生活”，并认为为使战俘能够回家过和平生活而交换战俘，是“一个反映双方的信誉的、理智的与人道的行为”，“在这里有达成停战协议的合理基础”。这显然是美方步调的改换。在过去，美方是不敢提到战俘应遣返回家过和平生活的字样的。
  但是，在哈利逊七月一日的发言中，他虽然表现了两个月以来所没有的愿意协商的态度，从而使谈判的向前推进有了一些希望，可是同时他又说什么“觅求我们同意强迫遣回战俘的任何协商都是徒劳的”。人们从这里可以看出，美方虽然一方面想要以协商态度来解决问题，但由于其国内、国外的种种原因，他们还不愿放弃其藉口战俘问题来拖延谈判、紧张局势的打算。朝中人民和全世界人民对此是应该加以严密注视的。
