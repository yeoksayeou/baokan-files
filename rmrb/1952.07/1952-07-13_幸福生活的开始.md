Column: The Motherland is Advancing

    Editor's Note: Starting with this issue, this publication establishes the "The Motherland is Advancing" column, which will regularly report on new people and new things emerging in all aspects of the political, economic, and cultural life of the people across the country. We hope that writers, reporters, and comrades in various work positions from all over will actively contribute to this column.

    A beautiful village has been built on the Qipandi (Chessboard Ground) east of Fengshan Mine in the Jingxing Mining Area, Hebei Province. This is a new village of more than 320 households built in 1951 after the Hebei Provincial People's Government allocated funds to help relocate residents from the three villages of Nan (South) Fengshan, Bei (North) Fengshan, and Yangjiagou.

    Speaking of this new village, it has a history of blood and tears.

    In September 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied the Fengshan Mine. In order to plunder China's coal reserves, they disregarded the lives and deaths of the residents and hollowed out the ground under the three villages of North and South Fengshan and Yangjiagou near the mine. Since then, incidents of land subsidence, house collapses, and human and livestock casualties have been constantly occurring in these three villages, and people were all panicky. Ma Suocheng's mother, recalling the miserable situation of that year, said, "When I was fifty-one years old, on the afternoon of the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, I suddenly felt the ground shaking, and then the house fell eastward. When I saw something was wrong, I ran out. As soon as I ran out of the gate, I looked back, alas! The east and north rooms were completely sunk into the ground, and the entire courtyard became a bottomless black hole. My heart shudders at the thought of it."

    At that time, a folk rhyme like this was circulating in the nearby villages:

    Closing the door to live,
    Calamity comes from underground;
    Mountains shake and the ground cracks in a gust of wind,
    Life and property sink into the bottomless pit.

    No one cared about the suffering of these residents during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They also talked about "relocating" the residents, but in reality, they were driving the residents of the "dangerous area" out. Ma Suocheng's mother, from the day her house collapsed, led her four children into a life of wandering. For a full nine years, she and other residents lived a life of being battered by wind and rain and living in constant fear.

    At that time, she often recited such a passage:

    Black cold leaves are bitter,
    Lala vegetables are sour, (Note: Black cold leaves and Lala vegetables are both wild vegetables)
    People without homes are in tears;
    The lives of the suffering people are as bitter as Coptis chinensis (a bitter herb),
    Bitter vines bear melons that are not sweet.

    In April 1947, the People's Liberation Army liberated the Jingxing Coal Mine, and the People's Government actively sought ways to protect the lives and property of the residents of these three villages. In 1950, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government sent cadres to these three villages to conduct investigations, listen to the opinions of the masses, and decided to relocate the residents of these three villages to build new villages elsewhere. This decision was unanimously welcomed by the masses. The Hebei Provincial People's Government allocated 4.8 million jin of millet as subsidies for relocating and building new villages, and the State Council of the Central People's Government specially instructed: "The construction of new villages must meet the requirements of hygiene, production, education, and so on."

    In the spring of 1951, more than 2,000 carpenters and tilers from Shijiazhuang, Jianping, and other places started construction on the Qipandi. After seven months of construction, by September of last year, more than 3,000 rooms of bungalows, tile-roofed houses, and cave dwellings had appeared on the Qipandi. In the center of the new village, a wide cross-shaped street runs from east to west and from south to north, and nine alleys are left according to the terrain that is low in the east and high in the west, so that the residents' residences can get sufficient sunlight. A brand-new primary school was also built on the high slope in the northeast corner of the village. The west side is the classroom, and the east side is a spacious sports field, which can be seen from a very far distance.

    On an evening before this year's "July 1st," I came to this new village with a happy mood. The small pagoda trees beside the wide street were covered with tender leaves, and people were enjoying the cool under the rows of new eaves, discussing the matter of helping each other dig wells. Innocent and lively children were singing and dancing to their heart's content. In front of the supply and marketing cooperative on the east side of South Street, young girls and daughters-in-law were crowded, choosing their favorite Soviet floral fabrics and beige socks. The deeds of production models were written on the blackboard newspaper next to the cross street.

    Village chief Zhang Rui (a coal miner) and I visited several households including Ma Lianshuan, Ma Lianyuan, and Li Wanxiang. The pomegranate, carambola, passionflower, and other flowers in each courtyard were blooming, and the courtyards were cleaned very well. When we arrived at the home of Ma Longlai on East Street, this old man in his sixties treated us like relatives who had been reunited after a long separation. He said, "Things that we couldn't do or dared not even think about for many years, Chairman Mao and the People's Government have done for us today. Before our new village was built, some people said: It would take at least three years to build it. But it was built in seven months. The Communist Party really says something and does it." Ma Suocheng's mother happily said when she saw us: "At sixty years old, I never thought that I would be able to live in such a good new house. With Chairman Mao, people who have been homeless for eight or nine years have moved into new houses again." She said with confidence in her future happy life: "My family has four people and six mu of land. My eldest son Suocheng works in the Yangquan Coal Mine, and my second son and eldest daughter-in-law and I farm. This year's wheat harvest is good, and Suocheng keeps sending money back. We have two meals of rice and one meal of wheat every day. Seeing that life is getting better and better every day, tell me why I shouldn't be happy!"

    Suffering people, coming out of broken houses, from earthen kilns, ancient temples, and ancient mountain caves overgrown with weeds, leading their children, pulling their donkeys, moving into clean, beautiful, and solid new houses, how can they not be happy from the bottom of their hearts! They deeply feel that these happy days are inseparable from the Communist Party and the People's Government. During the Spring Festival this year, the villagers sang such a clapper rhyme:

    The new village is different from the old village,
    Entering the village, you see all new houses,
    The streets are wide, the alleys are long,
    Supply and marketing cooperatives, barbershops, and grocery stores line both sides,
    A new school was built in the northeast corner.
    Good times start from now on,
    Chairman Mao's kindness is remembered in our hearts.

    After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued the call to donate airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army in 1951, the villagers of the new village were the first to respond enthusiastically. They revised the patriotic production increase and frugality plan, and within a few days, they donated 71.09 million yuan in Renminbi. Xu Shouchun alone donated 3.2 million yuan. He said: "If we don't work hard to produce and support the Volunteer Army, we will be sorry for our leader Chairman Mao and sorry for our new China." Now the production increase and frugality competition movement has been launched in the mine, and all the miners in the village have revised their production increase and frugality plans and participated in amateur cultural studies; more than 60 women have also participated in literacy classes, and most of the school-age children have gone to school.

    Every morning, when the sun shines red, when groups of miners carry steel picks and walk to the coal mine with laughter and talk, when farmers happily carry hoes and walk to the fields, when lively children carry their schoolbags and walk to their schools, they all naturally think from the depths of their hearts: Their lives, like those of every liberated Chinese working people, have been freed from the shackles of slavery, and on the free and beautiful land, under the nurturing of Chairman Mao, they have embarked on the road of happiness and light.

### 幸福生活的开始

专栏：祖国在前进

    幸福生活的开始
    柴毅
    编者按：本刊从这期起建立“祖国在前进”专栏，经常报道全国人民在政治、经济、文化生活各个方面出现的新人物和新事物。我们希望各地的作家、记者和各种工作岗位的同志们，踊跃给本栏写稿。
    在河北省井陉矿区凤山矿东的棋盘地上，建立起了一座美丽的村庄。这是一九五一年河北省人民政府拨款帮助南、北凤山、杨家沟三村居民迁移后修建起来的三百二十多户的新村。
    提起这个新村来，却有着一段血泪的历史。
    一九三七年九月，日寇侵占了凤山矿，为了掠夺我国的煤藏，不顾居民的生死，把矿附近的南北凤山和杨家沟三村的地下都掏空了。从此，地陷房塌，人畜伤亡的事件，就不断在这三村发生，人们都惶惶不安。马锁成的母亲回忆着当年的凄惨情景说：“在我五十一岁那年，旧历十月十六的下午，我忽然觉着地面摇晃起来，随着房子也向东倒下去，我一看事不好，拔腿就往外跑，刚跑出大门口，回头一看，唉呀！东屋、北屋整个陷到地下去了，整个院子变成了看不到底的黑洞。一提起这事来，我的心就打哆嗦。”
    当时在附近几村中流传着这样一支民谣：
    关着门子过，
    祸从地下来；
    山摇地裂一阵风，
    生命财产陷进无底洞。
    这些居民的苦难，在日寇和国民党反动派统治时期是没有人管的。他们也说过要居民“迁移”，实际上他们却是把“险区”的居民赶出去。马锁成的母亲，从她的房子陷落那天起，就领着四个孩子过起流浪生活来。足足九年，她和其他居民一样过着雨打风吹、提心吊胆的日子。
    那时她常念叨着这样一段话：
    黑寒叶儿苦，
    拉拉菜儿酸，（注：黑寒叶、拉拉菜都是野菜）
    没有家的人儿泪涟涟；
    受苦人的命和黄连一样苦，
    苦蔓儿结瓜瓜不甜。
    一九四七年四月间，人民解放军解放了井陉煤矿，人民政府就积极想办法保护这三村居民生命财产的安全。一九五零年，河北省人民政府和石家庄市人民政府便派干部到这三村进行调查，听取群众意见，决定把这三村的居民迁移到别处修建新村。这个决定受到群众一致的欢迎。河北省人民政府拨了四百八十万斤小米作为迁移修建新村的补助费，中央人民政府政务院特别指示：“新村的建设，必须适合于卫生、生产、教育等要求。”
    一九五一年春天，来自石家庄、建屏等地的两千多木瓦工人，在棋盘地上动了工。经过七个月的修建，到去年九月间，三千多间平房、瓦房、窑洞，就出现在棋盘地上了。新村的中央，从东到西、从南到北贯穿着宽阔的十字大街，根据东低西高的地势留出了九条胡同，使居民住宅都能得到充分的阳光。在村东北角的高坡上还修起了一座崭新的完全小学，西边是教室，东边是宽阔的体育场，在很远的地方就可以看到。
    今年“七一”前夕的一个傍晚，我怀着愉快的心情来到了这个新村。那宽阔的街旁的小洋槐树，已长满了嫩叶，一排排的新房檐下，人们正在乘凉，并谈论着互助打井的事。天真活泼的孩子们，尽情地唱着、舞着。南大街路东供销社门前，挤满了年轻的姑娘、媳妇，正在选择她们心爱的苏联花布，米色袜子等。十字街旁的黑板报上写着生产模范的事迹。
    我和村长张瑞（煤矿工人）访问了马连拴、马连元、李万祥等几户。各家院子里的石榴、洋桃、西番莲等花正在开放，庭院都打扫得很清洁。到了东街马龙来的家里，这位六十来岁的老人见了我们，就像久别重逢的亲人一样。他说：“我们多少年来办不了也不敢想的事情，今天毛主席、人民政府都给咱办到了。我们新村没有修起以前，有人这样说：最快也得修三年。可是，七个月就修起了。共产党真是说到那里，办到那里。”马锁成的母亲见了我们高兴地说：“六十岁的人啦，千想万想也没有想到能住上这么好的新房。有了毛主席，八、九年没有家的人又住上新房了。”她对今后的幸福生活充满信心地说：“我家四口人，六亩地，大儿子锁成在阳泉煤矿做工，二儿和大儿媳妇我们三口子种地，今年麦子丰收，锁成还不断捎个钱来，每天两顿米饭一顿面饭。眼看着日子过得一天比一天好，你说我为什么不喜欢！”
    苦难的人们，从破旧房子里，从土窑、古庙里，从荒草横生的古老山洞里走出来，领着自己的儿女，牵着自己的驴子，搬到清洁、美丽、结实的新房子里来住，怎么不从心里欢喜呢！他们深深感到这种幸福的日子是和共产党和人民政府分不开的。在今年春节时，村民们唱着这样一段快板：
    新村和旧村不一样，
    进村一看尽新房，
    街道宽，胡同长，
    供销社、理发馆、杂货铺子列两旁，
    东北角上修起了新学堂。
    好光景从此开头过，
    毛主席的恩情记心上。
    一九五一年中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军的号召以后，新村村民首先热烈响应。他们修订了爱国增产节约计划，几天内就捐献了人民币七千一百零九万元，只许守诚一人，就捐献了三百二十万元。他说：“我们不努力生产支援志愿军，就对不起我们的领袖毛主席，对不起我们的新中国。”现在矿上增产节约竞赛运动已开展起来，该村所有的矿工都修订了增产节约计划，并参加了业余文化学习；有六十多个妇女也参加了识字班，学龄儿童大部上了学。
    每天早晨，当太阳发出红光，一群群矿工扛着钢镐，有说有笑地走向煤矿去的时候，当农民们愉快地扛着锄头走向田里去的时候，当活泼的孩子们背着书包走向自己学校的时候，他们都从心的深处很自然地想到：自己的生活和每个解放了的中国劳动人民一样，摆脱了奴隶的枷锁，在自由美丽的土地上，在毛主席的抚育下，已踏上了幸福光明的道路。
