    Increased Production and Thrift Cannot Rely on Overtime
    Editor: In the "full load, exceeding axle weight, five hundred kilometer movement," Duan Rui, assistant section chief, and Huang Yun, chairman of the workshop trade union, of the Northeast West Fuxin Locomotive Depot, did not actively lead workers to tap potential and find tricks, but adopted the method of "if the task is not completed, work overtime" to force workers to process. On June 5th, Duan Rui and Huang Yun, etc., without asking for instructions from their superiors, arbitrarily ordered 20 workers and 4 cadres to work overtime. Among them, six workers worked overtime for three to four hours, three workers worked overtime for eight hours, and eleven workers worked overtime for twelve hours; three cadres worked overtime for twelve hours. Afterwards, Assistant Section Chief Duan Rui also wanted to conceal the truth, saying, "Only fifteen workers worked overtime, and the workers who worked overtime while sick were not included." Workshop Trade Union Chairman Huang Yun also said, "Only five workers worked overtime." The facts were completely different. Xu Shengzhao worked overtime for three hours while sick, and Liu Xin, also sick, worked overtime for twelve hours. He worked continuously for twenty-four hours without leaving the site, so tired that he could not straighten his back. After returning home, he could not even eat dinner and just lay in bed. Such overtime work does not solve any problems. The work that the workers rushed out all night mostly had to be reworked the next day, which instead affected the completion of the task. We request that relevant leading cadres conduct an in-depth inspection of the work of the section and correct this overtime phenomenon.

### 增产节约不能靠加班加点

    增产节约不能靠加班加点
    编辑同志：在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，东北西阜新机务段助理段长段瑞、车间工会主席黄云，不积极领导工人挖潜力、找窍门，却采用“完不成任务，就加班加点”的办法，强迫工人加工。六月五日，段瑞和黄云等，未向上级请示，就擅自命令二十名工人，四名干部加班加点。其中六名工人加点三至四小时，三名工人加点八小时，十一名工人加点十二小时；三名干部加点十二小时。事后，助理段长段瑞还要隐瞒，他说：“只有十五名工人加点，带病加点的工人却没有。”车间工会主席黄云也说：“只有五名工人加点。”事实完全不是那样，徐盛沼带病加点三小时，刘信有病，也加点了十二小时，他连续工作了二十四小时，没有离开现场，累得腰都直不起来了，回家后，饭也吃不下，就躺在床上了。这样加班加点并不能解决什么问题，工人们累了一宿赶出来的活，第二天大部分都要返工，反而影响了任务的完成。我们要求有关领导干部深入地检查该段工作，纠正这种加班加点现象。
