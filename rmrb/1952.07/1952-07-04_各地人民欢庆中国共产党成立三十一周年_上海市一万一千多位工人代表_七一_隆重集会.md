    At the celebration meetings and forums held by the people in various parts of East China, the responsible persons of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels called on all party members and the broad masses of working people to consolidate the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, to fully strengthen industrial and agricultural production, to carry out labor emulation campaigns, to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and to complete the tasks of the patriotic production increase and economy movement.

Party organizations in various places accepted a large number of applications for party membership from outstanding activists who emerged in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In Qingdao, the first batch of more than 600 outstanding industrial workers were approved to join the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the Central South region, the CCP provincial committees of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi provinces all convened meetings of party member cadres. The secretaries of the CCP provincial committees of various provinces called on all party members at the meeting to further consolidate the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, strengthen party building, strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to learn economic work in order to meet the high tide of national economic construction.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd--On the evening of July 1st, more than 11,000 worker representatives in Shanghai held a grand meeting at the Cultural Square to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Most of the more than 11,000 representatives were veteran workers, labor models, advanced workers, and model group leaders. Under the leadership and education of the Communist Party, they have adhered to the revolutionary struggle for many years, and have consistently played an active leading role in various movements after liberation, in production and in work. Some have been promoted to leading cadres in various positions in state-owned factories. Some have even gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Chen Yi first expressed his gratitude on behalf of the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP for the Shanghai workers' love and support for the Party. He excitedly traced the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Shanghai working class and the Party, explaining the Shanghai workers' contributions to the revolution in various periods and the great achievements in the three years since liberation. He called on the Shanghai working class to carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle and continue to contribute infinite wisdom and strength to the great economic construction of the motherland in the future.
    Tan Zhenlin, a responsible comrade of the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, also gave a report commemorating "July 1st" at the meeting. He called on the Shanghai workers to continue to carry forward the fine style of the working class, carry out the production increase and economy movement, and strive for the country's industrialization and for a happy and fulfilling communist future. Tan Zhenlin asked workers in state-owned, public, and joint public-private factories to vigorously carry out labor emulation campaigns, promote advanced working methods, advocate rationalization proposals, and complete the major tasks of production reform. The workers in private factories should consolidate the great victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, summarize the experience of the "Five-Anti" movement, improve their ideological understanding, strengthen the connection between cadres and the masses, further strengthen unity within the staff and workers, and strengthen the leadership and transformation of private enterprises to improve production.
    Next, Liu Changsheng, the third secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP, gave a report on the work of building the Party in factories at the meeting. He analyzed the current situation of party organizations in factories, and then specifically explained the important significance of developing party organizations in factories. He said: "For more than three years since liberation, through the Party's continuous education and the test of successive movements, the consciousness of the working masses has been greatly improved. They have deeply recognized the Party's greatness, glory, and correctness. A large number of outstanding workers are enthusiastically demanding to join their own party, and feel that being a Communist Party member is an unparalleled glory; in order to strengthen the Party's combat strength, strengthen the Party's leading role in production and construction, and constantly cultivate and absorb advanced workers into the Party, it is a very important political task of the Party at present." Liu Changsheng called on the workers to work hard to strengthen political, technical, and cultural studies, constantly improve their consciousness, strive to improve production, and be determined to strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.
    All the representatives enthusiastically responded to the calls of Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, and Liu Changsheng. Workers from 107 units wrote more than 400 letters to Chairman Mao, expressing their desire to work hard to increase production and practice economy, strengthen learning, and strive to join the Chinese Communist Party. Workers from the Lianye Iron and Steel Machinery Factory presented a computer with twenty-digit capability that they had carefully researched and created to welcome "July 1st."
    Finally, the entire assembly enthusiastically applauded and passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
