    PLA Soldier's Letter Celebrates "August 1st" and Thanks the People of the Capital

    Dear Fathers, Mothers, Brothers, and Sisters of the Capital: The "August 1st" Army Day is coming. This year's "August 1st" Army Day coincides with the great victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which makes us feel especially happy. In the past year, the care of the People's Government of the Capital and the fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters of the Capital for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has been meticulous. In the letters I receive from home, it is often written: "The people of the capital take great care of and respect the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. During festivals, government leaders personally come to offer condolences, everyone comes to hang honorary plaques and honorary lanterns, and to send subsidies and various material objects. Young friends and children sing songs to congratulate us. Our political status has been improved, we have participated in street work, and we enjoy various priority rights." This is a great encouragement to me and other comrades. I am determined to answer the people of the capital in this way: improve my cultural and political level, practice my skills well, and stand fast at my post to defend the motherland!
             Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Ji Fengbao

    解放军某部战士来信庆祝“八一”感谢首都人民
    首都的父老兄妹们：“八一”建军节到来了。今年的“八一”建军节，又正当全国抗美援朝获得伟大胜利和“三反”、“五反”运动获得伟大成就的时候，这使我们感到特别高兴。过去一年来，首都人民政府和首都的父老兄妹们，对烈属、军属的关怀是无微不至的。我接到的家信里常常写道：“首都人民对烈属、军属都很照顾，很尊敬。逢年过节，政府首长亲自来慰问，大家来挂光荣匾和光荣灯，来送补助金和各种实物。青年朋友们、少年儿童们唱着歌来祝贺。我们的政治地位提高了，参加了街道工作，享受着各种优先权利。”这不论对我或是其他同志都是极大的鼓舞。我决心这样来回答首都人民：提高自己的文化、政治水平，练好本领，坚守保卫祖国的岗位！
