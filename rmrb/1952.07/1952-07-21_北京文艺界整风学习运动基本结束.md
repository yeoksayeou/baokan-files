Xinhua News Agency, 19th:

    The rectification and study movement in Beijing literary and art circles has basically concluded. Through this rectification movement, Beijing's literary and art circles have made significant achievements in transforming their thinking and improving their work.
    The rectification and study movement in Beijing's literary and art circles coincided with the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements shortly after it began. This movement deepened the rectification and study, resulting in greater effects from the literary and art rectification. The main gains are: the broad masses of literary and art workers have clarified the boundaries between the proletarian literary and artistic thought and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thought; they have specifically realized that literary and art workers must carry out ideological transformation and must closely connect with the masses, delving into the lives and struggles of the masses. In accordance with this spirit, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized writers such as Ba Jin, and the All-China Musicians Association organized musicians such as Fei Ke, to go to the Korean front line to participate in the struggle. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles have all organized large numbers of literary and art workers to go to factories and rural areas to participate in the lives and struggles of the masses.
    Most of the literary and art institutions participating in the rectification movement carried out rectification and reform during the movement. The Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Institute of Literature, and the China Youth Art Theater have all formulated plans for improving their work, clearly defining their future guidelines and tasks. The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles simplified its administrative structure, enabling most personnel to concentrate on creation and research. The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles also rectified its organization and strengthened its guidance to mass amateur literary and art activities.
    The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' decision on adjusting literary and art publications has also been basically implemented during the rectification movement. The work of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) and "Renmin Wenxue" (People's Literature) has been strengthened. The publication of "Juben" (Playscript) and "Gequ" (Songs) has met the needs of the broad masses of readers.
    During this rectification and study movement, many erroneous literary and artistic ideas existing in Beijing's literary and art circles were exposed. On the issue of the relationship between literature and art and politics, some people believed that literature and art were irrelevant to politics; others vulgarized the relationship between literature and art and politics, such as forcibly inserting current political tasks, Communist Party policies, and Marxist-Leninist terms into historical dramas, believing that this was the combination of literature and art and politics. Regarding the issue of whom literature and art should serve, some people emphasized serving the petty bourgeoisie; some verbally acknowledged serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, but in their creative practice, they abandoned workers, peasants, and soldiers; and some literary and art workers used literature and art as a tool for obtaining fame and profit. On the issue of the popularization of literature and art, some people looked down on popularization, believing that popularization was a low-level job, and some simply adopted a resistant attitude towards popularization work; on the other hand, some people mistakenly believed that popularization meant shoddy workmanship and advocated "quantity over quality," which greatly harmed popularization work. Among literary and art workers, there was also a serious ideological trend of blindly worshiping the West and belittling the national artistic heritage, and some even believed that whether Chinese literature and art had a national heritage was doubtful. These erroneous literary and artistic ideas were all criticized during the rectification movement. Many leaders of literary and art work took the lead in making self-criticisms, thus promoting the ideological transformation movement of the broad masses of literary and art workers. However, among some literary and art cadres, the above-mentioned ideological problems have not been completely resolved and must continue to be criticized in future studies.
    In order to consolidate the achievements of this literary and art rectification and study, and to continue the ideological study of the literary and art circles, the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Committee held a joint meeting on the 14th. The joint meeting decided that since most literary and art units in Beijing had completed the literary and art rectification and study, the Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Committee would be dissolved, and the work of organizing and leading the regular study of the literary and art circles would be handed over to the various associations of the literary and art circles. The joint meeting decided to adjust the various literary and art organizations: simplify the administrative structure of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and strengthen the work of the four workers' associations of literature, drama, music, and fine arts; and determined that each association must regularly and systematically organize various literary and art workers' study, life experience, and creation, and organize seminars and discussions on literary and artistic thought and literary and artistic creation in the future. The joint meeting also decided to hold an enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in November this year to discuss the main issues in the creation of various aspects of literature and art, and to determine the future tasks of national literary and art organizations at all levels.

### 北京文艺界整风学习运动基本结束

    北京文艺界整风学习运动基本结束
    【新华社十九日讯】北京文艺界整风学习运动基本结束。经过这次整风运动，北京文艺界在改造思想和改进工作上都有了显著的成绩。
    北京文艺界整风学习开始后不久，即适逢伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动。这个运动使整风学习更加深入，因而文艺整风收到了更大的效果。其主要收获是：广大的文艺工作者划清了工人阶级文艺思想和资产阶级、小资产阶级文艺思想的界限；具体地认识到文艺工作者必须进行思想改造，必须密切联系群众，深入群众的生活和斗争。根据这种精神，中华全国文学艺术界联合会组织了作家巴金等，中华全国音乐工作者协会组织了音乐工作者费克等，先后去朝鲜前线参加斗争。中央人民政府文化部电影局、中央戏剧学院、中央音乐学院、中央美术学院和华北文学艺术界联合会筹备会都组织了大批文艺工作者去工厂、农村，参加群众的生活和斗争。
    参加整风的文艺机构大都在整风运动中进行了整顿和改革。中央戏剧学院、中央音乐学院、中央美术学院、中央文学研究所和中国青年艺术剧院等单位都订出了改进工作的方案，明确规定了今后的方针任务。华北文联筹备会简化了行政机构，使大部分人员集中精力从事创作和研究。北京市文联也整顿了机构，加强了对群众业余文艺活动的辅导工作。
    全国文联关于调整文艺刊物的决定，也在整风运动中得到了基本的实现。“文艺报”和“人民文学”的工作已有所加强。“剧本”和“歌曲”的出版适应了广大读者的需要。
    在这次整风学习中，暴露了北京文艺界所存在的很多错误的文艺思想。在文艺与政治的关系问题上，有人认为文艺与政治无关；也有人将文艺与政治的关系庸俗化，如将目前的政治任务、共产党的政策、马列主义名词硬装入历史剧中，认为这就是文艺与政治结合。关于文艺为谁服务的问题，有人强调为小资产阶级服务；有人在口头上承认为工农兵服务，但在创作实践中却抛开了工农兵；还有一部分文艺工作者，是把文艺来作为自己获取名利的工具。在文艺的普及问题上，有的人轻视普及，认为普及是低等的工作，也有人对普及工作干脆采取抗拒的态度；另一方面又有些人错误地以为普及就是粗制滥造，提倡“以量胜质”，这样对普及工作带来很大损害。文艺工作者中间也严重存在着盲目崇拜西洋与轻视民族艺术遗产的思想作风，甚至有人认为中国文艺有没有民族遗产还值得怀疑。这些错误的文艺思想都在整风运动中受到批判。许多文艺工作的领导人都带头作了检讨，因而推动了广大文艺工作者的思想改造运动。但在部分文艺干部中，上述各种思想问题还未彻底解决，还要在今后的学习中继续加以批判。
    为巩固这次文艺整风学习的成果，并使文艺界的思想学习继续进行，全国文联常务委员会和北京文艺界学习委员会在十四日举行了联席会议。联席会议决定：由于北京大部分文艺单位已完成了文艺整风学习，北京文艺界学习委员会宣告结束，而将组织和领导文艺界经常学习的工作，交给文艺界的各个协会去做。联席会议决定了调整各文艺团体：简化全国文联的行政机构，加强文学、戏剧、音乐、美术等四个工作者协会的工作；并确定各协会今后必须有计划地经常地分别组织各种文艺工作者的学习、体验生活和创作，组织有关文艺思想和文艺创作的座谈和讨论。联席会议还决定了在今年十一月举行全国文联全国委员会扩大会议，讨论文学艺术各方面创作中的主要问题，并确定全国各级文艺团体今后的任务。
