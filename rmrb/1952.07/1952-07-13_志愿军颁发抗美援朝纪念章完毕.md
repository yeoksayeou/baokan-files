Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: The Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medals, presented to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, have been completely distributed among all branches of the military and organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Prior to the distribution of the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medals, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a notice to the entire army, pointing out that the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medal is a supreme honor bestowed upon the Volunteer Army by the 500 million people of the motherland. All units should conduct extensive publicity and practical education when distributing the medals, to further stimulate the sense of honor of the troops and enhance their ideological awareness of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism.

In May and June, the various units of the Volunteer Army held grand medal presentation ceremonies, with the leaders of each unit personally awarding the medals. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Kaesong front held a medal presentation ceremony for three thousand people. More than 70 representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City and the Korean People's Army went to offer their congratulations. Park Won, a representative of the women of Kaesong City, said in her congratulatory speech: The Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medal presented to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army by the Chinese people not only represents the sentiments of the Chinese people, but also represents the sentiments of millions of Korean mothers and children. The Korean people will never forget the great and selfless internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

To prepare for receiving the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medals, commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army guarding Mount Wusheng on the central front launched a "kill the enemy competition week" on the forward positions. During this week, they shot down and damaged five enemy aircraft, destroyed three enemy tanks, and killed and wounded a large number of enemies. After being burned by the enemy's flamethrower in battle, soldier Su Shiying continued to fight bravely, killing 60 enemies alone, and was thus awarded the title of combat hero and model Communist Party member. Sun Fusheng commanded a platoon that bravely repelled the attack of two enemy battalions, annihilating 523 enemies. The warriors guarding Mount Wusheng solemnly held the medal presentation ceremony in tunnel fortifications. The political commissar of the regiment, who personally presided over the ceremony at the front line, read out the decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on awarding the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Medals amidst the fierce barrage of our army's artillery fire against the enemy. He pinned the medals on the representatives one by one. The representatives warmly thanked Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for the honor bestowed upon them, and sent letters of determination and challenge to the rostrum. Combat hero and model Communist Party member Su Shiying, on behalf of everyone, swore to the people of the motherland: We are determined to fight to the end for the final victory of the anti-aggression war of the Chinese and Korean people, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal!

    在颁发抗美援朝纪念章前，中国人民志愿军政治部曾向全军发出通知，指出抗美援朝纪念章是祖国五亿人民给予志愿军的崇高荣誉。各部队颁发纪念章时应进行广泛的宣传和切实的教育，以进一步激发部队的荣誉感，提高部队爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的思想觉悟。
    在五、六两月中，志愿军各部队曾举行了隆重的授章大会，由各部队首长亲自授发纪念章。开城前线的志愿军某部曾举行了三千人的授章大会。开城市各界人民和朝鲜人民军派了七十多名代表前往祝贺。开城市妇女代表朴温在会上致贺词说：中国人民赠给中国人民志愿军的抗美援朝纪念章，不仅代表着中国人民的心意，也代表着朝鲜千万个母亲和孩子的心意。朝鲜人民永念不忘中国人民志愿军伟大无私的国际主义精神。
    守卫在中部前线五圣山上的志愿军某部指挥员、战斗员为了准备接受抗美援朝纪念章，在前沿阵地上展开了一个“杀敌竞赛周”。他们在这一周中击落击伤敌机五架，击毁敌战车三辆，并杀伤了大批敌人。战士苏士英在战斗中被敌喷射器的火焰烧着以后仍奋勇作战，一个人击毙敌人六十名，因而荣获战斗英雄、模范共产党员的称号。孙富生指挥的一个排英勇地击退敌人两个营的进攻，歼灭敌人五百二十三名。守卫五圣山的勇士们在坑道工事里隆重地举行了颁发纪念章的仪式。亲临前线阵地主持仪式的团政治委员，在我军向敌轰击的猛烈排炮声中宣读了中国人民政协关于颁发抗美援朝纪念章的决定。并为代表们一一佩上纪念章。代表们热烈感谢毛主席和祖国人民给予他们的荣誉，纷纷将决心书、挑战书送到主席台上。战斗英雄、模范共产党员苏士英代表大家向祖国人民宣誓：决心为中朝人民反侵略战争的最后胜利而战斗到底，不达目的，誓不休止！
