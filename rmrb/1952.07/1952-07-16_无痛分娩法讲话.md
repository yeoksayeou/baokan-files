Speech on Painless Childbirth
Liu Minying

Editor's Note: After the publication of "The Soviet Union's Painless Childbirth Method" by Liu Minying, Vice President of the Clinical College of Tianjin First Military Medical University, on page three of this newspaper on May 16, it aroused widespread concern among readers. They wrote letters one after another, hoping that this newspaper would introduce painless childbirth in more detail. Now, we have specially invited Vice President Liu Minying to write this "Speech." Combining clinical experience, and through scientific analysis of the female reproductive system and functions, it explains in detail the reason why childbirth can be painless and the causes of childbirth pain. The speech is divided into four lectures, which will be published continuously in this newspaper starting today.

Lecture 1: Childbirth Pain in Women Can Be Prevented

Pain during childbirth for women has probably been a phenomenon for many ages of mankind. When there was no medicine or obstetrics in the world, people, due to lack of knowledge, assumed that most women experience pain during childbirth, and that the mother's pain was inevitable when a baby several times larger than the narrow birth canal was born from it. Therefore, even today, there is still a common saying among people: "You haven't given birth to a child, you don't know how bad the stomachache is."

After the world had medicine or obstetrics to relieve human suffering, some kind doctors and obstetricians began to think and study why women experience pain during childbirth, and how to treat and prevent this pain.

To study this problem, it should first be clarified whether childbirth pain is congenital or acquired? Is it a phenomenon beneficial to childbirth, or is it harmful to childbirth?

Previously, almost all medical scientists and obstetricians believed that childbirth pain was congenital. That is to say, their understanding was consistent with that of ordinary people. The reason is that they also saw that during childbirth, the uterus contracts vigorously, forcefully pressing the fetus down, and stretching the narrow birth canal greatly. How could this not be painful? They also analyzed that after humans evolved from apes to humans, they began a "standing" life. The "standing" life made the pelvis a fulcrum for bearing the weight of the body, which caused changes in the inclination of the pelvis. On the other hand, the soft support plate (muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc.) at the bottom of the pelvis was also strengthened and tightened due to the "standing" life, making the genital cleft smaller. So they came to a conclusion: Human childbirth is bound to be painful.

The above views were all obtained from superficial observations. Medical scientists and obstetricians were not satisfied with such superficial research, so they began to conduct laboratory research. Because childbirth pain is composed of both "labor pains" caused by uterine contractions and "birth pains" caused by the fetus passing through the birth canal, they divided childbirth pain into two parts for research. As a result of the scientists' research, they found that the amount of chemical substances that promote uterine contractions (one type is choline acetate and adrenaline, and the other type is follicular hormone) increased in the blood of pregnant women. So they took these reasons to explain the cause of uterine contractions during childbirth. They believed that "labor pains" were caused by uterine contractions, so they could of course use these things to explain the cause of "labor pains." Secondly, they believed that in the later stages of pregnancy, the amount of pituitary posterior lobe hormone in pregnant women increased, which enhanced the contraction sensitivity of the uterus, thus further intensifying the degree of childbirth pain. Because uterine contraction is necessary during childbirth, they believed that "labor pains" were also necessary and beneficial to childbirth. In recent years, this theory has developed to the extreme, forming the "necessary theory of childbirth pain." As for the occurrence of "birth pains," they believed that it was the result of the fetus pressing on the sympathetic ganglion of the cervix and the nerve endings of the birth canal as it passed through the birth canal.

Although these theories are based on laboratory or clinical research, recent research and experiments by Soviet obstetricians based on Pavlov's theory have proved that the above theories are one-sided and incorrect. According to the Soviet method of painless childbirth, it is possible to have completely no "labor pains" and "birth pains," which proves that childbirth pain is not "necessary," that uterine contractions during childbirth in women do not necessarily have to cause "labor pains," and that dilation of the birth canal does not necessarily have to cause "birth pains." This means that although follicular hormone and pituitary posterior lobe hormone are related to uterine contractions, they are not substances that promote uterine pain. Although choline acetate can cause uterine contractions, choline acetate does not appear in the blood of pregnant women according to the Soviet method of painless childbirth. This proves that choline acetate has no significance for the cause of normal childbirth movements, so how can it be said that it is a cause of pain?

What kind of view do Soviet obstetricians have on the occurrence of childbirth pain?

They believe that women's reproductive organs have a very high degree of adaptability to pregnancy and childbirth, and that all the phenomena of childbirth movements are also adapted to the structure and function of the female reproductive organs as much as possible.

In order to enable everyone to correctly understand the phenomena of female pregnancy and childbirth, it is necessary for us to first talk about the female reproductive organs that are directly related to reproduction - what is its structure and how does it adapt to reproductive phenomena.

Let's first talk about the labia minora. The vulva is a complex cleft located between the lower abdomen and the anus. It is composed of the following parts: mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibule, hymen, vulva, external urethral orifice, lesser vestibular glands, greater vestibular glands.

The mons pubis and labia majora are skin elevations that store a lot of fat. They maintain the proper swelling and softness of the vulva to facilitate sexual intercourse. The labia minora are mucous membrane flaps containing countless sebaceous glands, which have the function of preventing vaginal dryness. The subcutaneous tissue of the labia and labia majora contains spongy tissue. When sexual desire occurs, this part is filled with blood. The vestibular glands secrete mucus when sexual desire occurs, lubricating the vestibule and vulva, creating favorable conditions for sexual intercourse. The vulva has a certain degree of tension in peacetime, which makes both sexes interested in sexual intercourse. However, the expansibility of the vulva is very large, and the limit of expansion as large as the baby's head will not cause the vulva to rupture. This provides good conditions for childbirth.

In order to understand the truth of pregnancy and childbirth, it is also necessary for us to talk about the internal reproductive organs. It includes the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and accessory ligaments. These organs are in the small pelvis, located between the bladder and the rectum. Humans have two ovaries, which are organs that produce human eggs, periodically discharge mature eggs, and secrete stimulating hormones (endocrine hormones) into the blood, which control the periodic changes of sexual organs.

The fallopian tube adheres to the surface of the ovary with its fimbriated end. When the ovary ovulates, it captures the egg and transports it to the uterus. The meeting of male and female cells is completed in the fallopian tube.

The uterus is flat front and back, pear-shaped about the size of a fist, and is muscular tissue. It is like a rubber sac that can expand and contract. A wide uterus has a part that exists in the abdominal cavity, and a narrow cervix has a part that protrudes into the vagina. The uterus is a hotbed for the fetus. Under the control of the nervous system and neurohumoral system, the endometrium undergoes periodic changes. The thick and sticky endometrium provides very good conditions for the "implantation" of the fertilized egg, and waits for "implantation." If the fertilized egg does not "implant," then all the prepared conditions are completely useless. At this time, it begins to create conditions for the next ovulation again. This manifestation is the general menstrual bleeding. The cross-section of the vagina is H-shaped, from the front and lower direction to the back and upper direction, it is a finger-long mucous membrane tube, narrow on the outside and wide on the inside, creating favorable conditions for the interest of sexual intercourse. In particular, the front and rear parts of the cervix are cystic and enlarged, and are specially called the anterior and posterior fornix.

    无痛分娩法讲话
    刘民英
    编者按：五月十六日本报三版发表天津第一军医大学临床学院副院长刘民英的“苏联的无痛分娩法”一文以后，曾引起广大读者的关心。他们纷纷来信，希望本报更详细地介绍无痛分娩法。现在，我们特请刘民英副院长撰写了这篇“讲话”。它结合临床经验，通过对妇女生殖机构和机能的科学分析，比较详细地说明了分娩可以无痛的道理以及造成分娩疼痛的原因。讲话共分四讲，从今日起连续在本报发表。
    第一讲    妇女的分娩疼痛是可以预防的
    妇女生孩子时发生疼痛，这恐怕是人类很多年代的现象了。当世界上还没有医学或产科学的时候，人们由于缺乏知识，一看到绝大多数的妇女生孩子时发生疼痛，就以为：从狭窄的产道里生出一个比产道大多少倍的婴儿，母亲的疼痛是不能避免的。所以直到今天，人们中间还流行着一句俗话：“你没有生过孩子，你不知道肚子痛的厉害。”
    世界上有了为解除人类痛苦的医学或产科学以后，有些善良的医学家和产科医生，就开始思索和研究妇女分娩时为什么发生疼痛，以及如何治疗和预防这种疼痛。
    要研究这个问题，首先应该弄清，分娩疼痛是先天的还是后天发生的？它是有益于分娩的现象，还是有害于分娩的现象？
    以前几乎所有的医学家和产科医生，都认为分娩疼痛是先天的。也就是说，他们和一般人们的认识是一致的。原因是他们也看到：在分娩时，子宫大力收缩，硬把胎儿压迫下降，把狭窄的产道撑的很大，这怎么能不疼痛呢？他们也分析到：人类由猿发展到人以后，即开始“立行”的生活，“立行”的生活使骨盘成了负担身体重量的支点，因而使骨盘的倾斜度发生了变化；另一方面，骨盘底的软部支持板（肌肉、肌腱、韧带等）也因为“立行”生活的关系而强化和紧张，使生殖裂孔变小。于是他们得出了一个结论：人类分娩是一定要发生疼痛的。
    上述见解，都是从表面观察中得到的。医学家们和产科医生们，对这样表面的研究并不感到满足，于是他们就开始作实验室的研究。因为分娩疼痛是由子宫收缩而来的“阵痛”和胎儿通过产道而来的“产痛”两者所构成，所以他们就把分娩疼痛分成两部分来研究。科学家们研究的结果，他们从产妇的血中发现促进子宫收缩的化学物质（一类是醋酸胆胺和肾上腺素，另一类是卵胞荷尔蒙）增多的现象。于是他们就拿这些理由去解释分娩时子宫收缩的起因。他们认为“阵痛”是由子宫收缩而来，当然也就可以拿这些东西解释“阵痛”的起因。其次，他们认为产妇在怀孕后期，她的脑下垂体后叶荷尔蒙量增多，以致增强了子宫的收缩感受性，因此使分娩疼痛的程度更形加剧。因为分娩时子宫收缩是必需的，于是他们认为“阵痛”也是必需的，对分娩是有好处的。近年来，这种理论发展到登峰造极的地步，形成了“分娩疼痛必需说”。至于“产痛”的发生，他们认为是胎儿通过产道时，压迫子宫颈部交感神经节和产道的神经末梢的结果。
    以上这些理论，虽然是立脚于实验室或临床的研究；但以巴甫洛夫学说为基础的苏联产科医生们在近年来的研究和实验，证明了以上的理论带有片面性和不正确性。按照苏联的无痛分娩法进行分娩，可以完全无“阵痛”和“产痛”，这证明了分娩疼痛并非“必需”，妇女分娩时的子宫收缩并非一定要发生“阵痛”，产道扩张并非一定要引起“产痛”。这也就是说，卵胞荷尔蒙和垂体后叶荷尔蒙虽然对子宫收缩有关，但并不是促进子宫疼痛的物质。醋酸胆胺这种物质虽然能惹起子宫收缩，但按照苏联无痛分娩法进行分娩，产妇血中并不出现醋酸胆胺。这证明醋酸胆胺对正常分娩动作的起因没有什么意义，怎么能说它是引起疼痛的一种东西呢？
    苏联的产科医生们对分娩疼痛的发生究竟抱有怎样的见解呢？
    他们认为：妇女的生殖器官对妊娠和分娩，有极高度的适应性，而分娩动作的一切现象，也是尽量和女性生殖器的构造和机能相适应的。
    为要使大家正确了解女性的妊娠和分娩现象，我们有必要首先讲一讲和生殖有直接关系的女性生殖器官——它的构造怎样，又是怎样地适应生殖现象的。
    我们先讲一讲小阴部。外阴部是位于下腹部及肛门之间的复杂裂沟，它是由下列各部分构成的：阴阜、大阴唇、小阴唇、阴挺、前庭部、处女膜、阴门、外尿道口、小前庭腺、大前庭腺。
    阴阜及大阴唇是蓄有很多脂肪的皮肤隆起部，由它保持外阴部适当的膨隆度及柔软度，以便利于性交。小阴唇是含有无数皮脂腺的粘膜瓣，有防止阴道干燥的作用。阴唇及大阴唇皮下含有海绵样组织，发生性欲时，此部即充满血液。前庭腺在发生性欲时分泌出粘液体，滑润前庭及阴门，造成性交的有利条件。阴门在平时有一定的紧张度，这样使两性性交发生兴趣。但阴门的扩张性是很大的、像婴儿头部那样大的扩张限度，不会使阴门发生破裂。这一点，又给分娩创造了良好条件。
    为了解妊娠和分娩的真象，我们讲一讲内生殖器也是必要的。它包括阴道、子宫、卵管、卵巢及附属韧带。这些器官在小骨盘内，位于膀胱及直肠之间。人有两个卵巢，卵巢是制造人卵的器官，定期排出成熟的卵子，同时分泌刺戟素（内分泌素）到血中，支配性器官的周期性变化。
    输卵管以剪彩部和卵巢表面粘连，在卵巢排卵时，将卵捕捉，把它输送到子宫去。男女两性细胞的会合，是在卵管内完成的。
    子宫是前后扁平，呈拳大的洋梨形，是肌肉组织。它很像一个橡皮囊，可以扩张，也可以收缩。宽大的子宫，有一部存在于腹腔内，狭细的子宫颈有一部分突出于阴道内。子宫是胎儿的温床。在神经系和神经体液的支配下，使子宫内膜起周期性的变化。肥厚又粘稠的子宫内膜，给妊卵提供了“着床”的很好条件，而等待着“着床”。如果妊卵未“着床”，则一切准备的条件完全无用。此时遂又开始为下一次排卵重新创造条件。这种表现，就是一般的月经出血。阴道的横断面呈H形，自前下方向后上方，为一指长的粘膜管，外方窄狭，内方宽阔，给性交的兴趣创造了有利条件。尤其是子宫颈前后部呈囊状膨大，特称为前后穹窿部。
