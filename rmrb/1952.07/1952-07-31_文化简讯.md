     "Study Translations" No. 6, 1952 - Content Introduction

    The important contents of "Study Translations" No. 6, 1952, include two articles by prominent Soviet philosophers: Rosenthal's "Development as the Struggle of Opposites" and Konstantinov's "Basic Characteristics of the Socialist Ideological System." Rosenthal's article is divided into eight sections, with three sections published in this issue. These three sections focus on clarifying the significant meaning of the law of the struggle of opposites in Marxist dialectics; elucidating that the struggle of opposites is the source and driving force of the development of all things; and clarifying the relationship between internal and external contradictions. Understanding these issues will greatly help in studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." Konstantinov's article points out that thorough democracy, Soviet patriotism, and internationalism are important features of the socialist ideological system. The socialist ideological system has unparalleled superiority over the capitalist ideological system; only the socialist ideological system is a vibrant and truly scientific ideological system. This issue also publishes Alexandrov's "The Ideological System of American Imperialists is a Cannibalistic Ideological System." This article powerfully refutes the ideological essence of the most reactionary Malthusian theory in the American imperialist ideological system. Reading this article will further enhance the understanding of the superiority of the socialist ideological system. In addition, this issue includes Vislobokov's "Against the 'Physical' Idealist Variant - Modern 'Energeticism'." Finally, there are explanations of several philosophical terms.

     "Liberation Army Literature" July Issue - Content Introduction

    This issue of "Liberation Army Literature" publishes Chen Yi's "Guarantee to Do a Good Job in the Company's Cultural Work" and Wang Xinting, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region's, "Persistently Implement the Literary and Artistic Policy of Facing the Company and Serving the Soldiers." The former points out how literary and artistic workers should strengthen their mass viewpoint ideologically and proposes various specific measures for implementing the literary and artistic policy of facing the company and serving the soldiers from an organizational and operational standpoint. The latter provides a more detailed exposition on the issue of delving into the life of the company.

    This issue primarily features a poem by a soldier and six ethnic minorities thanking Chairman Mao, commemorating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese Communist Party. It also includes a frontline dispatch from Comrade Wang Xilin, a soldier of the 8th Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, titled "For a Better Tomorrow," and a battle novel by Comrade Lige, a pen name of a regimental commander of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteers, titled "Blocking Fuguli." The latter depicts a victorious and fierce battle of a steel company under enemy encirclement. The author, 29 years old this year, is a brave and skilled young commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He composed a 60,000-word novella based on his experiences while commanding the battle in the trenches, squeezing in time to write. This is the last chapter being published independently.

    This issue has three special sections. One is "On the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Front," which summarizes the heroic labor of 100,000 PLA soldiers in the great Jingjiang project. One is "The Great Motherland Inspires Us," written by returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, enthusiastically praising the people of the motherland who are valiantly struggling for Chairman Mao's cause. The third special section is "Soldiers' Clapper Poems."

     “学习译丛”一九五二年第六号内容介绍

    本期以首要篇幅刊载了一个战士和六个兄弟民族感谢毛主席的诗，以纪念伟大中国共产党成立的三十一周年，此外还有我志愿军某部八连战士王熙麟同志的战地通讯“为了美好的明天”，和志愿军某团团长笔名里加同志的战斗小说“卡住釜谷里”。后者是写一个钢铁连队在敌人四面围攻下的一场胜利的恶战，作者今年二十九岁，是志愿军的一个英勇善战的青年指挥员。他是在战壕里一面指挥作战，一面挤时间把自己经历的事写成六万字的中篇小说；这里是作为独立发表的最后一章。
    本期有三个特辑，一个是“在荆江分洪战线上”，概括地反映了我十万解放军在荆江伟大工程中的英雄劳作。一个是“伟大祖国鼓舞着我们”，由志愿军归国代表们所写，热忱地歌颂了为毛主席事业而英勇奋斗的祖国人民。第三个特辑是“战士快板诗”。
