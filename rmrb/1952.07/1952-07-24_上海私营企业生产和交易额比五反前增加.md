Shanghai Private Enterprises' Production and Transaction Volume Increased Compared to Before the Five-Anti Campaign

Shanghai's "Five-Anti" movement, due to the correct implementation of the principle of "combining the Five-Anti with production," has not only basically stabilized normal economic life during and after the basic conclusion of the "Five-Anti" movement, but also generally increased the production and transaction volume of private industrial and commercial enterprises beyond the level before the "Five-Anti" movement. According to statistics from the end of last month, the industrial output of cotton yarn, flour, paper, gold pens, electrolytic copper, wire nails, matches, soap, and other products from Shanghai's private factories increased by 13% to 216% when comparing the first half of this year to the first half of last year. As for the market commodity turnover, comparing June with February, cotton yarn increased by 202%; flour increased by 52%; cotton cloth increased by 339%; and sugar and oil both increased by 30% to 40%. The largest increase was in chemical raw materials, which generally increased by two to ten times.

The rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce in Shanghai during and after the basic conclusion of the "Five-Anti" movement is inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, as well as the strong support of the state-owned economy. At the very beginning of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai, due to the temporary suspension of processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans by state-owned enterprises, and the resistance of some illegal industrialists and businessmen who evaded funds and shut down factories and shops to resist the "Five-Anti" movement, coupled with the off-season at that time, the market economy experienced a temporary sluggishness. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government, based on the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, promptly proposed and implemented the principle of "combining the Five-Anti with production," and actively carried out procurement and loan work starting in March. In April, the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, together with relevant state-owned enterprise institutions in East China, organized the Shanghai Municipal Processing and Ordering Committee to vigorously develop processing, ordering, purchasing, and loan work. Priority was given to supporting industries that were closely related to the national economy and had development prospects; those with better equipment, more workers, and products that met specifications were given as much consideration as possible. With the support of state-owned enterprises, most of the larger private factories had solved their difficulties by April, and market transaction volume also began to increase. In May, in order to further restore production and invigorate the market, production committees were established in various districts of Shanghai to cooperate with the Municipal Processing and Ordering Committee to continue processing and ordering work, and to appropriately allocate processing and ordering tasks to small and medium-sized factories with insufficient working capital and products that met specifications; those that still could not solve their funding difficulties through processing and ordering were then provided with loans by banks. The East China Trade Department, together with the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, convened a conference on the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The total transaction amount of the conference was more than 1,700 billion yuan, with Shanghai representatives purchasing more than 640 billion yuan of local and special products and selling more than 550 billion yuan of industrial products. Through this conference, 54 local product industries opened up business, and long-standing slow-selling goods such as handkerchiefs, socks, and outdated fabrics found sales channels. Some factories, such as silk weaving, knitting, shoe making, and celluloid industries, which had already stopped or were preparing to stop production, rapidly recovered production due to selling slow-selling goods and undertaking a large number of futures orders. The sugar, seafood, northern goods, and longan industries also sent people to the countryside to purchase goods. The number of private merchant purchase certificates issued by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in June increased sevenfold compared with February, and the purchase funds increased by more than one time compared with February. At the same time, the People's Bank actively organized discounting to solve the financial difficulties of private merchants, enabling the seafood, northern goods, longan, fruit, local goods, and oil extraction industries to eliminate concerns about insufficient funds during the meeting and conduct transactions freely. In June, in order to reduce manufacturers' costs and encourage manufacturers' enthusiasm, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank, in accordance with the instructions of the head office and district banks, reduced the deposit and loan interest rates for private enterprises by 20% to 50%. In order to meet the requirements of small manufacturers, the People's Bank also launched small loans of less than 10 million yuan, enabling more than 1,500 manufacturers with a small shortage of funds to obtain working capital. In total, state-owned enterprises took care of 99 industries in the processing, ordering, purchasing, and loan work in the three months of April, May, and June, which greatly enlivened the temporarily sluggish market.

However, the recovery and development of industry and commerce in Shanghai is uneven. Before the "Five-Anti" movement, some industrial and commercial enterprises started by stealing state property and relied on stealing state property to maintain themselves. Some enterprises, due to excess equipment, raw material difficulties, poor production technology, and low product quality, still could not maintain themselves. The development of these industrial and commercial enterprises in the past was blind. In the process of today's economic reorganization, they need to change careers or shrink. This situation is a normal situation in economic restructuring, which shows that Shanghai's economy is moving from the old economic track to the new economic track.

Now, the "Five-Anti" movement has basically ended. Through the "Five-Anti" movement, the class consciousness of workers and shop assistants has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. Most capitalists have begun to realize that private industrialists and businessmen have broad prospects for development as long as they engage in legitimate business and no longer commit the "five poisons." At present, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the united efforts of workers and shop assistants, Shanghai's private industry and commerce are working hard to restore and develop production and invigorate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas on the basis of eliminating the "five poisons."

### 上海私营企业生产和交易额比五反前增加

    上海私营企业生产和交易额比五反前增加
    上海市“五反”运动，由于正确地贯彻了“五反与生产相结合”的方针，在“五反”运动期间和“五反”运动基本结束以后，正常的经济生活不但基本上稳定了，而且一般私营工商业的生产、交易额都超过了“五反”运动以前的水平。根据上月底的统计，上海市私营工厂的棉纱、面粉、造纸、金笔、电解铜、洋钉、火柴、肥皂等工业产量，如以今年上半年与去年上半年作比较，增加了百分之十三至百分之二百十六不等。至于市场商品成交量，如以六月与二月相比，则棉纱增加百分之二百○二；面粉增加百分之五十二；棉布增加百分之三百三十九；糖、油均增加百分之三十到四十。增加得最多的是化工原料，一般都增加了二倍至十倍。
    “五反”期间和“五反”基本结束以后，上海市工商业的迅速恢复和发展，是和毛主席和中央的正确领导及国营经济的大力扶助分不开的。在上海市
    “五反”运动刚刚开始的时候，由于国营企业加工、定货、收购、贷款暂时停止；一部分不法工商业家以逃避资金、停厂关店抗拒“五反”，加上当时适逢淡季，因此市场经济，曾经出现了暂时的呆滞现象。上海市人民政府根据毛主席及中央的指示，及时提出并贯彻了“五反与生产相结合”的方针，在三月份起就积极进行了收购和贷款的工作；四月份上海市财政经济委员会又会同华东有关国营企业机构组织了上海市加工定货委员会，大力开展加工、定货、收购、贷款工作。对于那些与国民经济关系较密切、有发展前途的工业首先加以扶助；对设备较好、工人较多、产品又合乎规格的则尽量予以照顾。经过国营企业的扶助，较大的私营工厂到四月份已经大部分解决了困难，市场交易量也开始增加。五月间，为了进一步恢复生产活跃市场，上海市各区成立了生产委员会，配合市加工定货委员会继续进行加工定货工作，并对流动资金不足、产品合乎规格的中、小型厂也酌情分配加工定货任务；经过加工定货依旧不能解决资金困难的，再由银行发放贷款。华东贸易部又会同上海市人民政府工商局，召开了城乡物资交流大会，总计大会成交金额
    一万七千余亿，上海代表购进土特产品六千四百多亿，销出工业品五千五百多亿。通过这次大会，五十四个土产行业做开了生意，手帕、袜子以及花色过时的布疋等积压很久的滞销品都找到了销路。部分工厂如丝织、针织、制鞋、赛璐珞等行业原来已经停工或准备停工，由于卖掉了滞销品，而且承制了大量期货，生产迅速得到恢复。食糖、海味北货桂圆业也纷纷派人下乡采购物资。六月份工商局发出的私商下乡采购证张数比二月份增加七倍，采购资金比二月份增加一倍多。与此同时，人民银行并积极举办押汇，以解决私商经营资金上的困难，使得海味北货桂圆、水果、地货、榨油等行业能在会议期间消除了资金不足的顾虑，放手进行交易。六月份，人民银行上海分行为了减低厂商成本，鼓励厂商经营的积极性，遵照总行及区行的指示，又将私营企业的存放款利率，降低百分之二十到五十。为了适应小型厂商的要求，人民银行又举办了一千万元以下的小额放款，使得一千五百多户缺款不多的厂商，获得了周转的资金。总计国营企业在四、五、六三个月内的加工、定货、收购、贷款工作，
    一共照顾了九十九个行业，这样就使暂时呆滞的市场大大活跃起来。
    但是上海工商业的恢复和发展是不平衡的：在
    “五反”运动以前，有一部分工商企业，是依靠了盗窃国家财产而起家，而且依靠盗窃国家财产来维持的；也有一部分企业，由于设备过剩、原料困难、生产技术太差、产品品质低劣等原因，依旧无法维持。这些工商企业过去的发展是盲目的，在今天经济改组的过程中，就需要转业或紧缩。这种情况，是经济改组中的一种正常情况，这正说明着上海市的经济，正在从旧的经济轨道走向着新的经济轨道。
    现在，“五反”运动基本上已经结束。通过“五反”运动，工人、店员的阶级觉悟大大提高，生产热情空前高涨；大部分资本家已开始认识到私营工商业者只要从事正当经营，不再犯“五毒”，是有广阔的发展前途的。目前，上海市私营工商业正在上海市人民政府的领导和工人、店员的团结努力下，在肃清“五毒”的基础上，为恢复和发展生产、活跃城乡物资交流而努力。
