    Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory Should Resolve Workers' Difficulties

    To the Editor: The high rate of worker absenteeism at the jointly state-private Huaxin Textile Factory in Tangshan is hindering the progress of the "Increase Production and Practice Economy" campaign. Last year, the average worker attendance rate reached 95%. However, from January to May of this year, the average attendance rate only reached 92%, with the Zhongzi shift in the spinning workshop averaging only 87.68%. Why has the attendance rate declined? Preliminary investigations reveal the following main reasons:

    1. Many workers are falling ill. From January to May of this year, the monthly average of sick workers accounted for 50.6% of the total factory workforce, a 20% increase compared to the same period last year. Among the various ailments, gastrointestinal diseases account for 30%, mostly due to insufficient time for meals and poor digestion. The factory only allocates 20 minutes for meals per shift. After deducting the time spent shutting down machines, going to the restroom, going to the cafeteria, waiting in line for food, returning to the workshop, and preparing to start the machines, only five or six minutes remain for eating. Some workers say, "If you want to eat something soupy, you'll burn your mouth!" To save time, some workers buy pancakes or fried dough cakes and eat them in the cotton-filled workshop, then immediately return to work after eating. Furthermore, the factory's health education for employees is inadequate, and many workers like to eat snacks, which further contributes to the problem. In addition to gastrointestinal diseases, gynecological problems also account for 30%, mainly due to malnutrition and weakened physical condition among female workers.

    2. The factory has not adequately addressed the special difficulties faced by female workers in terms of labor allocation. The Zhongzi shift in the spinning workshop has 230 workers, including 61 female workers with children and 25 pregnant female workers. They have the highest rates of absenteeism. The Zhongzi shift averages 44 absentees per shift, with one instance reaching 56 absentees, of which female workers accounted for 55. Sometimes, due to excessive worker absenteeism, the workers on duty have to work overtime or increase their workload. Many physically weak female workers are therefore afraid to go to work.

    The leadership of Huaxin Textile Factory has not given sufficient attention to these problems within the factory. Some cadres even believe that "female workers with children are too backward." Therefore, I suggest that Huaxin Textile Factory improve safety and hygiene practices, take effective measures to address workers' illnesses, provide appropriate care in terms of life and work for pregnant and unhealthy female workers, and strengthen safety and hygiene education for workers and their families.

### 唐山华新纺织厂应当解决工人的困难

    唐山华新纺织厂应当解决工人的困难
    编辑同志：唐山市公私合营的华新纺织厂，工人缺勤现象严重，已成为开展增产节约竞赛运动的阻力。去年工人出勤率平均达到了百分之九十五，今年一至五月工人出勤率平均只达到百分之九十二，细纱车间中字班平均只达到百分之八十七点六八。出勤率为什么下降呢？经初步调查，主要是：
    一、工人患病的很多。今年一至五月，每月害病的人平均占全厂职工总数的百分之五十点六，比去年同时期的病人增加了百分之二十。在各种病症中，肠胃病占百分之三十，原因多半是因为吃饭的时间过短，消化不良。该厂每班吃饭时间只有二十分钟，除去关车、上厕所、去食堂、排队买饭、回车间、整理开车等所占去的时间，只剩下五、六分钟的吃饭时间了。有的工人说：“如果想吃点稀的，把嘴都烫破了！”有些工人为了方便，便买些大饼、果子饼在棉絮飞腾的车间吃，吃饱以后，马上劳动。另外，因为该厂对职工的卫生教育不够，许多工人爱吃零食，更助长了这种病的发生。除肠胃病外，妇女病也占百分之三十，这主要是由于女工营养不良，体质衰弱而引起的。
    二、在劳动力配备上该厂对女工的特殊困难，没有予以适当解决。细纱间中字班有工人二百三十人，其中有小孩的女工有六十一人，怀孕的女工二十五人，他们缺勤最多。中字班每班平均有四十四人缺勤，有一次缺勤达五十六人，而女工即占五十五人。有时因工人缺勤的过多，上班的工人就要加班，或增加工作量。很多身体弱的女工因此也不敢上班。
    华新纱厂领导方面对厂内存在的这些问题，至今没有予以足够的重视，有的干部反认为：“有小孩的女工太落后了。”因此我建议华新纺织厂改进安全卫生工作，对工人的疾病作有效措施，对怀孕和身体不好的女工给予生活和工作上的适当照顾，对工人和工人家属也应加强安全卫生教育。    沈曦
