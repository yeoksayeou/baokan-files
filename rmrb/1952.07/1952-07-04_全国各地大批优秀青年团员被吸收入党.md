Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd—Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League is increasingly developing and consolidating, and its role as a reserve force is becoming increasingly significant. A large number of outstanding Youth League members have been admitted into the Party. At the same time, more and more League members and League cadres are being transferred to various work positions in the Party, government, and other fields.

Currently, there are over five million Youth League members nationwide. The League has cultivated a large number of members with the standards of Communist Party members, and many outstanding Youth League members have been approved to join the Communist Party after being recommended by the League organizations and reviewed by the Party organizations. Among the one million Youth League members in North China, 100,000 have joined the Chinese Communist Party. According to incomplete statistics from Northeast China, by March of this year, 20,000 Youth League members in factories had joined the Party. In Shanghai and Qingdao, more than 2,800 League members have joined the Party in the past three years. From January to March this year, during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, 1,182 League members in 17 provinces (regions) and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Pingyuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan joined the Party. Among the League members admitted into the Party in various regions, a large proportion are from worker backgrounds. Last year, factory workers accounted for 20 percent of the League members admitted into the Party in East China. In Shanghai, more than half of the League members admitted into the Party in the past three years are factory workers.

The Youth League members admitted into the Party in various regions are all activists in production, work, and study, and many are heroes and model workers. Examples include Zhao Guoyou, a nationally renowned labor model; Zheng Xikun, a labor model who pioneered the 500-kilometer ultra-axis record; Gong Jinmei, a factory-protection hero from the State-owned Shanghai No. 9 Textile Factory; and Chinese People's Volunteer Army members Jie Xiumei, Xiao Ziyun, and Kang Hanting. After these League members joined the Party, their class consciousness was further enhanced, their work became more active, and they added fresh blood to the Party.

Over the past three years, with the needs of national construction in various fields, League organizations in various regions have cultivated and transferred a large number of League members and League cadres to work in various departments such as the Communist Party, the government, and people's organizations. Northeast China transferred 7,423 people in the second half of last year, and East China transferred 3,040 people in the first half of this year. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, in order to welcome the arrival of large-scale economic construction nationwide, League organizations in various regions are actively and systematically transferring a large number of League member cadres to industrial and mining enterprises. The Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Youth League recently transferred 150 rural League members from seven counties including Shuangcheng and Acheng to participate in basic construction work. These League members transferred to various positions are all outstanding members of the League. For example, most of the 42 League member cadres transferred by the Jinan Municipal Working Committee of the Light Industry Youth League are "tiger-beating" heroes and advanced producers.

    全国各地大批优秀青年团员被吸收入党
    【新华社二日讯】中国新民主主义青年团在中国共产党的领导下，日益发展和巩固，其后备军作用也日益显著，大批优秀的青年团员被吸收入党。同时，越来越多的团员和团的干部被输送到党和人民政府等各种工作岗位上去。
    目前，全国已有五百万以上的青年团员；团内已培养出大批具有共产党员水平的团员，其中有许多优秀的青年团员经过团组织的推荐和党组织的审查，已被批准加入了共产党。华北地区一百万个青年团员当中，已有十万人加入了中国共产党。据东北地区的不完全统计，到今年三月为止，有两万名工厂中的青年团员入党。上海、青岛两市三年来入党的团员有二千八百多人。今年一月到三月三个月内，在“三反”“五反”运动中，北京、上海、旅大、平原、川西、川南等十七个省（区）、市就有一千一百八十二名团员入党。各地入党的团员中，工人出身的团员占很大比例。去年华东地区入党的团员中，工厂中的团员占百分之二十。上海市三年来入党的团员有一半以上是工厂中的团员。
    各地入党的青年团员都是生产、工作和学习中的积极分子，有许多是英雄模范。如全国有名的劳动模范赵国有、首创超轴五百公里纪录的劳动模范郑锡坤、国营上海第九纺织厂的护厂英雄龚金妹、中国人民志愿军解秀梅、萧子云、康汉亭等。这些团员入党后，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，工作更加积极，给党增加了新血液。
    三年来，随着国家各方面建设的需要，各地团组织培养和输送了大批团员和团的干部到共产党、人民政府和人民团体等各个部门去工作。东北地区在去年下半年输送了七千四百二十三名，华东地区在今年上半年输送了三千零四十名。在“三反”“五反”运动以后，为了迎接全国大规模经济建设的到来，各地团的组织正主动地、有计划地输送大批团员干部到工矿企业中去。青年团松江省委最近从双城、阿城等七县抽调了一百五十名农村团员，参加基本建设工作，这些输送到各个岗位上的团员都是团员中的优秀分子。如青年团济南市轻工业工作委员会输送的四十二名团员干部，大部分是“打虎”英雄和先进生产者。
