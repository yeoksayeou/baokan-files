    奉贤 County Reduces Meetings During the Busy Farming Season
    To the Editor: In the busy farming season, cherishing the farmers' labor and rest time is a major issue. However, many village cadres do not understand this. For example, in some villages in Fengxian County, Southern Jiangsu, a cadres' meeting can last until 2 a.m., and usually until 12 a.m.; some mass meetings are held for several consecutive nights, each lasting until 12 a.m. or 1 a.m. Sometimes, after mass meetings go on into the latter half of the night, 50 percent of the masses fall asleep in the meeting, but the cadres presiding over the meeting are still talking incessantly. This has produced extremely bad results, and some people simply refuse to attend meetings. Some farmers reflect, "Big meetings every three, six, nine days, small meetings every day." In order to correct this shortcoming, the Fengxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has specially formulated regulations on minimizing the convening of various meetings and shortening the duration of various meetings as much as possible during the busy farming season, and recommends that the government adopt and implement them. The regulations are as follows: 1. Generally, no mass meetings should be held during busy farming periods; if it is absolutely necessary to hold a meeting, it should generally not exceed half an hour, and at most not more than forty minutes; systematic educational mass meetings are limited to one hour and must not be exceeded. At mass meetings, work such as formulating statistical forms and investigating materials must not be carried out; nor should special investigative mass meetings be held. 2. Village cadres' meetings are limited to two hours, and farmers' group leaders' meetings are limited to one hour. If it is necessary to hold a meeting for a whole day or several whole days, it must be approved by the county-level leading body. 3. Various meetings must be carefully prepared in advance, such as the content of reports, discussion topics, etc.
    The results of testing this regulation in Xiulong Township in the county have been very satisfactory to the masses. I think this experience is worth referring to in other places.

### 奉贤县在农忙期间减少开会

    奉贤县在农忙期间减少开会
    编辑同志：在农忙季节，珍惜农民的劳动时间和休息时间，是一个极大的问题。但是很多村干部不了解这一点。如苏南奉贤县的若干村，竟有召开一个干部大会要开到夜间二时的，一般的也要开到夜间十二时；有的连续开数夜的群众大会，每次也要开到夜间十二时或一时。有时，群众大会开到下半夜以后，百分之五十的群众在会场上睡着了，主持会议的干部还在滔滔不绝地讲道理。这样就产生了极坏的结果，部分群众干脆拒绝出席会议。有的农民反映：“大会三、六、九，小会天天有。”为了纠正这种缺点，中共奉贤县委员会特拟定关于在农忙季节尽量减少召开各种会议和尽量缩短各种会议时间的规定，建议政府采纳执行。规定是这样的：一、农忙紧张时，一般不开群众大会；万不得已要开会时，一般也不得超过半小时，最多不超过四十分钟；有系统的教育性的群众大会以一小时为限，不得超过。在群众大会上，不得进行制定统计表格、调查材料等工作；也不得召开专门的调查性的群众大会。二、村干部会议以二小时为限，农民的小组长会议以一小时为限。如需召开一整天或几整天的会议，须经县级领导机关批准。三、各种会议必须事先周密准备，如报告内容、讨论题目等。
    这个规定，经在该县秀龙乡试验的结果，群众很满意。我认为这个经验是值得其他各地参考的。
