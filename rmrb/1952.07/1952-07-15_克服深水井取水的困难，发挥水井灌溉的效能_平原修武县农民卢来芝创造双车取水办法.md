Editor's Note: The waterwheel is an excellent tool for irrigation for farmers in the North. However, existing waterwheels are only suitable for wells within four *zhang* [approximately 13 meters], which means that many areas, despite having abundant underground water sources at lower levels, cannot utilize waterwheels for extraction. The "Double-Wheel Water Extraction Method" created by Lu Laizhi solves this difficulty. Of course, using two sets of waterwheels on two wells is more expensive, but before a waterwheel suitable for deep wells is made, Lu Laizhi's "Double-Wheel Water Extraction Method" can play a certain role in drought prevention and resistance. In areas with suitable conditions, this experience can be adopted. However, when digging a dry well next to a water well, attention must be paid to the seepage of the water-holding part to avoid excessive water loss and to ensure the safety of the water well.

The groundwater level in Jiahetun Village, Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, is very low, and the wells are very deep. Among the one hundred and fifty-five wells, more than thirty are as deep as six *zhang*. Therefore, new-style waterwheels cannot be used. Using a windlass for watering requires three strong laborers per well per day, and can only irrigate three-tenths of an acre of land. This has limited the expansion of irrigated land and has added many difficulties to drought resistance work over the years. During the drought resistance and planting last year, Lu Laizhi, a farmer in the village, created the double-wheel water extraction method. This method involves digging a dry well about three *zhang* deep next to a six *zhang* deep water well, with a waterwheel installed in each well. The waterwheel installed on the six *zhang* deep water well extracts water, which then flows through a water pipe more than three *zhang* long and a water scoop installed halfway up the well, which connects to the dry well, causing the water to flow into the dry well first, and then the dry well sucks the water to the ground. This solves the difficulty that existing waterwheels cannot extract water from deep wells. In order to test this water extraction method, Lu Laizhi mobilized nine households to dig a well together and successfully tested it in July last year. Two livestock and two people could irrigate more than two acres of land per day, increasing irrigation efficiency by six and a half times. After the masses in the surrounding villages learned about this, they voluntarily went to visit. Under his influence, the farmers in this village have dug eight dry wells and adopted the double-wheel water extraction method from this spring to now. The remaining six *zhang* deep wells in this village are planned to be all converted into double wells this autumn and next spring.

    克服深水井取水的困难，发挥水井灌溉的效能
    平原修武县农民卢来芝创造双车取水办法
    编者按：水车是北方农民汲水灌溉的优良工具。但是现有的水车，只适用于四丈以内的水井，以致不少地区虽有丰富的水位较低的地下水源，还不能利用水车汲水。卢来芝创造的“双车取水法”解决了这个困难。当然在两个井上使用两套水车，成本要高一些，但在适用深井的水车还没有制成以前，卢来芝的“双车取水法”对防旱抗旱是能发挥一定作用的。在有条件的地区，可以吸取这一经验。但在水井旁打旱井时，必须注意容水部分的渗漏问题，以免过多地损失水量，并可保障水井的安全。
    平原省修武县嘉禾屯村的地下水位很低，水井都很深。在一百五十五眼井中，有三十多眼深达六丈。因此不能使用新式水车。用辘轳浇水，每眼井每天用三个强壮劳力，只能浇种三分土地。这就限制了扩大浇地面积，给历年抗旱工作，增加了许多困难。在去年抗旱下种时，该村农民卢来芝创造了双车取水办法。这个办法是在六丈深的水井旁，打一眼三丈左右深的旱井，每井各安一辆水车。六丈深的水井上所安装的水车，吸水时，通过三丈多长的水管和安在井半腰贯通旱井处的水簸箕，使水先流入旱井，然后再由旱井把水吸到地上。这样就解决了现有水车不能在深井取水的困难。卢来芝为了试验这种取水办法，动员九户共同打井，并在去年七月试验成功。每天两个牲口两个人，可浇地二亩多，提高了浇地效率六倍半。周围村庄的群众知道了这件事情后，都自动前往参观。这个村的农民在他的影响下，由今春到现在，打了八眼旱井采用了双车取水的办法。这个村其余六丈深的井，计划今秋明春全部打成双井。    （新乡专署农林科）（附图片）
