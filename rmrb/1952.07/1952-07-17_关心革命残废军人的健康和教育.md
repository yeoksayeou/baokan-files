    Concerning the Health and Education of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers
    Editor: Our Shandong Province First Honorary Soldiers Middle School has a total of more than four hundred and seventy students and staff, but only one hundred and eighty-four rooms. Besides being used as classrooms, offices, and kitchens, the remaining rooms are used as dormitories. On average, each dormitory (17 square meters) houses five people, so some staff with chronic infectious diseases also live with everyone. This indeed has a great impact on everyone's health. We hold meetings and eat meals in the yard. The school is situated on low-lying terrain and has no walls, so when it rains, the yard is flooded, and some dormitories are even flooded with more than a foot of water. Comrades are all asking to improve these conditions. In terms of education, comrades also have opinions, especially regarding the allocation of teachers. For example, one physics teacher is sixty-eight years old, hard of hearing, and the students don't understand what he is saying. This greatly hinders the progress of teaching. Also, in mathematics, it was planned to be completed in one semester, but it was not finished in three semesters.
    For the sake of the health and education of revolutionary disabled soldiers, we hope that the higher authorities will quickly inspect the work here and make appropriate arrangements.

    关心革命残废军人的健康和教育
    编辑同志：我们山东省第一荣誉军人中学共有学员和工作人员四百七十多人，而仅有房子一百八十四间。这些房子除了用作教室、办公室、厨房的以外，其余的即作宿舍。平均每间宿舍（每间十七平方公尺）要住五个人，因此一些带有慢性传染病的人员也和大家住在一起。这对大家的健康确有很大的影响。我们开会、吃饭都在院子里。学校所处的地势低，又没有围墙，下雨时水流满院，有的宿舍还冲进了一尺多深的水。同志们都纷纷要求改善这些情况。在教育方面，同志们也是有意见的，特别是对教员的配备。如一位物理教员，年已六十八岁，耳朵聋，说的话学员也不懂。这对于教学的进行是大有妨碍的。又如数学，本计划一学期讲完，结果三学期也没有讲完。
    为了革命残废军人的健康和教育，我们希望上级迅速把这里的工作检查一下，作一适当处理。
