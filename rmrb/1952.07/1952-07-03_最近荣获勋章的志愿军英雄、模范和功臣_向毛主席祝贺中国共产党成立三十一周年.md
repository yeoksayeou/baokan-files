Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st. Combat heroes, model workers, and people's meritorious servants of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have recently been awarded various medals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have written letters to Chairman Mao to congratulate him on the thirty-first anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Guo Zhongtian and Xu Changfu, first-class combat heroes of the Volunteer Army who were awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal, Tan Bingyun, a second-class combat hero who was awarded the First Class Soldier's Honor Medal, Xiao Ziyun and Xu Jingchun, special-class people's meritorious servants, and Liu Xiuzhen, a first-class people's meritorious servant who was awarded the Second Class Soldier's Honor Medal, said in a joint letter to Chairman Mao: We are bravely and intelligently fighting the American aggressors in Korea. In the past twenty months, we have become stronger and stronger and have achieved great victories. We have not only wiped out a large number of enemies in battle, but also built an indestructible steel front line on the entire front. We have also achieved initial victories in crushing the enemy's bacteriological warfare. In order to defend peace and thwart the enemy's aggressive conspiracy, we are determined to further unite and lead the masses to inflict heavier blows on the enemy, strive for a complete victory in the war against the United States, and never stop until our goal is achieved.

    Ma Ruhua, a second-class combat hero who was awarded the First Class Soldier's Honor Medal, once commanded a battalion of troops in continuous combat for fourteen days and nights, repelling more than two hundred assaults by two enemy regiments, and annihilating more than 1,200 enemies. In a letter to Chairman Mao, Ma Ruhua said: I am a Communist Party member, and the Party has given me infinite strength; whenever I am in difficult and dangerous situations, I think of the Party and Chairman Mao, and I am able to overcome all difficulties. On the thirty-first anniversary of the Party's birth, I assure the Party and Chairman Mao: I will unite the masses and work hard to learn tactics and techniques, and prepare to inflict heavier blows on the American aggressors.

    Zhang Baofu, a first-class people's meritorious servant who was awarded the Second Class Soldier's Honor Medal, said in a letter to Chairman Mao: I deeply feel that it is because the Party and Chairman Mao have led us to build an increasingly strong motherland and led us to undertake the cause of defending world peace that we have won such lofty honor. I will certainly maintain and carry forward glory, firmly stand at the forefront of the battle, and fight to the end for the victorious conclusion of the Korean war against aggression.
