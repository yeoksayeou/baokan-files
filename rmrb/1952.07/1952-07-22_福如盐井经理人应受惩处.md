    The Manager of Furu Salt Well Should Be Punished
    Editor: Liu Jiwu, the manager of the private Furu Salt Well in Zigong City, Sichuan Province, has consistently neglected production safety, resulting in a boiler explosion at the well at 4:00 PM on May 10th. This resulted in the deaths of two employees, serious injuries to four, minor injuries to five, and minor injuries to four people outside the well.

    Following the accident, relevant authorities in Zigong City organized an investigation team. It was learned that during the autumn factory and mine safety and hygiene inspection in Zigong City last year, it was pointed out that the safety valve on this boiler was malfunctioning and had to be repaired. However, Liu Jiwu did not take this suggestion seriously and failed to carry out the repair, leading to this incident. The safety and hygiene equipment at the well was also very poor; they were even unwilling to purchase the most basic colored lenses and thermometers. More seriously, there was a workers' dormitory in the factory building, connected to the boiler room by only one wall. This room was short and cramped, and in the summer, living inside was like being steamed in a large steamer. The workers had raised concerns about these issues more than once, but Liu Jiwu had never taken steps to improve them. Therefore, we hope that the relevant authorities will give Liu Jiwu the punishment he deserves.

    福如盐井经理人应受惩处
    编辑同志：四川省自贡市私营福如盐井经理人刘辑五，一贯忽视生产安全工作，致使这个井的锅炉在五月十日午后四时发生爆炸，死亡职工二人，重伤四人，轻伤五人，井外还有四人负轻伤。
    这件事故发生后，自贡市有关机关即组织调查小组进行调查。据了解，去年自贡市举行秋季厂矿安全卫生大检查时，即曾提出这个锅炉上的保险活门失效，必须把它修好。但刘辑五却并不重视这个建议，一直没有进行修理，以致发生这次事件。在安全卫生设备方面，该井也作得很差，甚至连最起码的色镜和体温表，也不肯购买。更严重的是厂房内有一工人宿舍，和锅炉连在一起，中间仅隔一墙，这间房子又矮又挤，到了夏天，住在里边简直就和被蒸在大甑子里一样。工人们对这些情况曾不只一次地提出意见，但是刘辑五却一直没有设法改善这些问题。因此，我们希望有关方面对刘辑五应给予应得的惩处。
