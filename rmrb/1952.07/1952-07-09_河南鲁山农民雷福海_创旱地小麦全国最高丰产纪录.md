Henan Lushan Farmer Lei Fuhai
Sets National High-Yield Record for Dryland Wheat

    Lei Fuhai, a farmer in Lushan County, Henan Province, harvested 1,317 jin of wheat from 1.73 mu of dryland this year, averaging more than 761 jin per mu. This yield surpasses the previous national high record of 640 jin per mu of wheat on dryland, set last year by Zhang Xiaoren, a farmer in Song County, Henan.

    The reasons for Lei Fuhai's high yield are, in addition to favorable natural conditions, mainly soil improvement, deep plowing and careful cultivation, and the selection of superior wheat varieties suitable for local growing conditions. His wheat field was originally barren land, lower in elevation than neighboring land. Over the years, rainwater washed fertile silt and leaves, which rotted in the field, resulting in a soil with a particularly high humus content. Last spring, Lei Fuhai reclaimed this land, using an iron pick to dig more than a foot deep and harrowing it fifteen times. When he planted rice for the first time last year, he plowed it again and harrowed it four times, greatly improving the original soil. Last autumn, when planting wheat, he carried out deep plowing and careful harrowing on this land, and applied sufficient fertilizer; this made the land even more fertile. At the time of wheat sowing, the local area was dry and lacked moisture, but because his land contained a large amount of nutrient-retaining and moisture-preserving humus, and was low-lying, it did not lack moisture, so it was able to be sown in a timely manner. During the winter, this piece of land also retained a large amount of snow, which both preserved moisture and killed insects. After the wheat grew this spring, he hoed it twice, and the wheat grew exceptionally strong.

    The use of superior varieties is also an important reason for Lei Fuhai's high yield. The wheat variety he used was "124," which has a development period about a week earlier than ordinary wheat. This year, most of the local wheat suffered from wind and rain during the flowering period, but Lei Fuhai's wheat had already passed the flowering period and was not affected by the disaster. When the wheat was about to mature, much of the wheat was blown down by the wind, but although his wheat stalks were as high as four feet five inches, they were not blown down by the wind because the stalks were hard and wind-resistant. In addition, his wheat was free from diseases and insect pests, so he obtained a high yield. When harvesting the wheat on Lei Fuhai's 1.73 mu of land, under the guidance of local cadres, separate harvesting and single threshing were carried out in order to promote its use.

### 河南鲁山农民雷福海  创旱地小麦全国最高丰产纪录

    河南鲁山农民雷福海
    创旱地小麦全国最高丰产纪录
    河南省鲁山县农民雷福海所种的一亩七分三厘旱地小麦，今年收了一千三百一十七斤麦子，平均一亩产量是七百六十一斤多。这个产量突破了去年河南嵩县农民张孝仁所创造的旱地每亩收麦六百四十斤的全国最高纪录。
    雷福海获得高额丰产的原因，除自然条件较好以外，主要是改良土壤，深耕细作和选用了适宜于本地生长条件的优良麦种。他这块麦地原来是一块生荒，地势较邻地低，历年雨水冲来肥沃的淤泥和树叶等沤积在地里，因此，土壤中含腐植质特别多。去年春天，雷福海开垦这块地，用铁镐刨了一尺多深，耙了十五遍。去年第一次种稻子时，又耕了一遍，耙了四遍，使原来的土壤大大改良。去秋种麦子时，他在这块地里又进行了深耕细耙，并施了足够的肥料；这块地就更加肥沃了。小麦播种时，当地天旱缺墒，而他这块地因含大量保蓄养料和保存水分的腐植质，地势又低不缺墒，所以能够及时播种。冬季这块地又保持了大量积雪，既保墒又灭虫。今春麦子长起来后，他又锄了两遍，麦子长的异常壮旺。
    采用优良品种，也是雷福海获得高额丰产的重要原因之一。他采用的麦种，是“一二四”品种，这种麦种比一般小麦发育期约早一个星期。今年当地一般小麦在扬花期大都遭受风雨为害，而雷福海的小麦已过了扬花期，未受到灾害。小麦快成熟时，不少小麦被风吹倒，而他的小麦麦棵虽高达四尺五寸，但因秆硬抗风，却没有被风吹倒。加之他的小麦又无病虫害，因此获得了高额的丰产。收麦时，雷福海这一亩七分三厘小麦，在当地干部指导下，进行了分收单打，以备推广。
