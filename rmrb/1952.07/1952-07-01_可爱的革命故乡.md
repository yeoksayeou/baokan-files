    Lovely Revolutionary Homeland
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qu Yifan
    Within the mountainous territory of Ruijin County, there are two extraordinary villages. On three sides, interlocking mountains form a natural barrier for these two villages, and ancient camphor trees grow into forests, shading the village skies. These are Ye坪 (Ye Ping) and Shazhouba townships, where the Central Democratic Government and the CPC Central Bureau were located during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. The First and Second National Congresses of Workers and Peasants, of great historical significance, were held successively in these two townships. At that time, Chairman Mao lived in the central villages of these two townships—Ye坪 Village and Zhou Village.
    In the autumn and winter of 1934, after the Red Army set off on the Long March from here, the Kuomintang reactionaries and local tyrants carried out cruel persecution of the people of Ye坪 and Shazhouba. They frantically destroyed every house, every tile, every blade of grass, every tree – anything that could evoke memories of the revolution. But all they could destroy were some bricks and tiles; they could never destroy the people's hearts. People risked their lives to preserve many important revolutionary relics and waged an unyielding struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhou Village has been renovated, and the furniture, cultural relics, and utensils used by Chairman Mao that year are now displayed in their original state in this former residence. The "Red Army Martyrs Memorial Tower" in Ye坪, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, was rebuilt last year in its original form, standing majestically on the square of the site of the First National Congress of Workers and Peasants.
    Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the heroic people of the revolutionary homeland are building a happy life. In a very short period of time, the people of Ye坪 township overcame various difficulties and built a new-style water conservancy project – the Ye坪 Dike. Ye坪 township has a total of 2,748 mu of fields, but all of it is loose sandy soil, very susceptible to drought. Therefore, there is a local saying: "It rains on all sides, but the middle is sunny, only my Ye坪 is drought-stricken to death." In 1932, when Chairman Mao lived in Ye坪, he saw this situation and discussed the issue of water conservancy construction with the peasants. He personally rode a horse to survey the terrain upstream of the river that passes through Ye坪, but because the river water was too low from the field surface and the project was too costly, it was impossible to construct in the difficult wartime environment at that time. But now the peasants' wishes have finally been realized. After Ye坪 township completed land reform last year, the peasants were determined to overcome various difficulties and build this water conservancy project. The project irrigates more than 3,000 mu of land. In addition to providing Ye坪 township with a perennial water source, it can also irrigate a portion of the fields in the neighboring Shaz坪 and坪shan townships. The project started construction in November last year and was completed in early May this year with the active support and assistance of the local Party committee and People's Government (later, due to a flood in Ruijin, a corner of the Ye坪 Dike was washed away and a repair project was carried out). On the day the project was officially released after completion, men and women, old and young, all came out to visit. When the surging water head rushed in, a burst of cheers of "The water is here! The water is here!" immediately rang out in the crowd. Many people shouted excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao saved my Ye坪!" Because of the completion of this project, this year the grain output of Ye坪 township can increase by 30 percent compared to previous years, and the output can be greatly increased in the future as the project earthworks are gradually consolidated and the amount of irrigation increases. This is an important start for the people of Ye坪 township to build a happy life.
    This year's patriotic production increase competition in Shazhouba has also achieved great results. Stepping into Hongshazhou at the southern end of the township, in front of the village is a green expanse of rice fields. Newly sprouting tender ears of rice are blooming with emerald yellow rice flowers, and the early-maturing "early rice seeds" are hanging down heavily. Yang Rongyuan, the production inspector of the most famous Yang Ronglan Mutual Aid Team in Ruijin County, happily led me to visit their thousand-jin high-yield fields this year (producing more than 1,000 jin per mu). The rice there is already more than three feet tall, with lush and dense clumps; other crops such as taro, peanuts, and tobacco are also growing very well. The members of the Yang Ronglan Mutual Aid Team are neighbors of Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhou Village. The entire group of twelve households has 75 mu of land, and this year they selected 20.88 mu as "thousand-jin high-yield fields," and they also require other rice fields to increase production by 20 to 30 percent compared to normal years. In order to ensure the completion of the production increase task, fertilization was greatly increased compared to previous years. The entire group generally achieved three plowings and four harrowings and three cultivations and two topdressings (topdressing is the application of additional fertilizer) for ordinary rice fields, and the high-yield fields all achieved four plowings and five harrowings and four cultivations and three topdressings. Under the demonstration and promotion of this advanced mutual aid team, this year Shazhou administrative village has organized twelve permanent or seasonal mutual aid teams, organizing 92 households with 474 people, accounting for about 73 percent of the total peasant population of the village.
    The people of Ye坪 and Shazhouba, rich in revolutionary tradition, warmly respond to and modelly implement all calls and policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government. For example, the publicity of the Marriage Law, cultural learning, and epidemic prevention and health campaigns are all proceeding very well. From last year to March and April of this year, according to statistics from the two townships, a total of 36 couples of men and women freely married, there are no more child brides, and the situation of women being abused is gradually disappearing. Women are actively participating in agricultural production. Many women have learned to plow, harrow, transplant, and plant rice, and women's social status has also been greatly improved as a result. After the launch of this year's health campaign, farmers in various townships have paid attention to the cleanliness of indoors, outdoors, toilets, and sewers. In particular, Ye坪 Village, where Chairman Mao lived, every courtyard in the village is very clean. In the past, there was always a sewage ditch in front of every house or in the middle of the courtyard, but now they have all been filled in. Because both townships have implemented land reform, the vast number of peasants have politically and economically turned over, and the demand for cultural emancipation is also very urgent. Now, each of the two townships has a county-run complete primary school, with more than 320 children enrolled, 98 percent of whom are children of poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants. Ye坪 township and the Shazhou and Chating administrative villages in Shazhouba township have established eight civil schools, and more than 530 young and middle-aged men and women farmers regularly attend school every night. They have also established clubs and theater groups in the civil schools. Ye坪 township has also established five newspaper reading groups specifically for the elderly, regularly sending "little teachers" to read newspapers to them.
    The people of the revolutionary homeland are working hard to build a new life, and this new life is inspiring them. They are confidently engaged in creative labor, striving to achieve even greater victories on the production and construction front!

    可爱的革命故乡
    新华社记者  曲一凡
    在群山环抱的瑞金县境内，有两个不平凡的乡村。这两个乡村的三面都有交叉合围的山峦构成了天然屏障，乡村中古老的樟树成林，荫蔽着村落的上空。这就是第二次国内革命战争时期中央民主政府和中共中央局所在地的叶坪和沙洲坝乡。具有伟大历史意义的第一次和第二次全国工农代表大会就是先后在这两个乡举行的。当时，毛主席就住在两乡的中心村落——叶坪村和洲村。
    一九三四年秋冬，红军从这里出发长征后，国民党反动派和地主豪绅对叶坪和沙洲坝人民曾施行了残酷的迫害，他们对这里的一房一瓦，一草一木，凡是足以引起对革命怀念的东西，都疯狂地加以破坏。但是他们所能毁去的只是一些砖石和瓦片，却永远毁不了人们的心。人们冒着危险将许多重要的革命文物保存下来，和国民党反动派进行了不屈的斗争。现在，沙洲村的毛主席故居已经修葺一新了，当年毛主席使用的家具、文物和器皿等，现在都按照原样陈列在这所故居里。被国民党反动派毁去的叶坪的“红军烈士纪念塔”，去年又照原来的样子重建起来，雄巍地矗立在第一次全国工农代表大会旧址的广场上。
    革命故乡的英雄人民，今天正在共产党和人民政府的领导下建设着幸福的生活。叶坪乡人民在很短的时间内，就克服了各种困难，建筑起一座新式水利工程—叶坪陂。叶坪乡共有田二千七百四十八亩，但全部是酥松的沙土，很怕亢旱，因此当地有句话说：“四边下雨中间晴，单单旱死我叶坪。”一九三二年毛主席住在叶坪时，看到这种情形，曾和农民们研究过兴修水利的问题，并亲自骑马到穿过叶坪的大河上游去勘察地形，但因河水距田面太低，工程耗费太大，在当时艰苦的战争环境里不可能施工。可是现在农民的愿望终于实现了。去年叶坪乡完成了土地改革以后，农民们就决心克服各种困难建造这座水利工程。这个工程的灌溉面积达三千多亩，除叶坪全乡从此有了常年足用的水源外，还可灌溉邻近沙坪、坪山两乡的一部分田。工程是去年十一月动工的，在当地党委和人民政府的积极支持和帮助下，已在今年五月上旬竣工（后来因瑞金发生一次洪水，叶坪陂被冲毁一角，又进行了补修工程）。工程竣工后正式放水那一天，全乡男女老少都出来参观，当汹涌的水头奔来时，人群中立刻响起了一片“水来了！水来了！”的欢呼声，很多人激动地高喊着“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席救了我叶坪！”的口号。由于这个工程的完工，今年叶坪乡的粮食产量可以比往年增产百分之三十，到明后年工程土方逐步巩固、灌溉量增加以后，产量更可大增。这是叶坪乡人民建设幸福生活的一个重要的开端。
    沙洲坝今年的爱国丰产竞赛运动，也已获得了很大的成绩。踏进该乡南端的红沙洲，村前是一片碧绿的稻田，新抽出来的嫩穗，盛开着翠黄色的稻花，早熟的“早禾子”种的稻穗已沉甸甸地下垂着。瑞金全县最有名的杨荣兰互助组的生产检查员杨荣远，十分高兴地领着我去参观他们今年的千斤丰产田（每亩产一千斤以上），那里的稻禾已高达三尺以上，禾兜蓬壮深密；其他如芋子、花生、烟叶等也都长得很好。杨荣兰互助组的组员们是沙洲村毛主席故居的近邻，全组十二户共有田七十五亩，今年选择了二十点八八亩为“千斤丰产田”，对其他稻田也都要求比常年增产二成至三成。为了保证增产任务的完成，施肥比往年大大增加，全组一般稻田普遍做到三犁四耙和三耘二点（点即施追肥），丰产田都做到了四犁五耙和四耘三点。在这个先进互助组的示范和推动下，今年沙洲行政村已组织了十二个常年或季节性的互助组，组织起来的有九十二户四百七十四人，约占全村农民总人口的百分之七十三。
    富有革命传统的叶坪和沙洲坝人民，对于共产党和人民政府的一切号召和政策都热烈地响应和模范地执行着。例如婚姻法的宣传、文化学习和防疫卫生运动等等，一切都进行得很好。从去年到今年三四月间，据两个乡的统计，自由结婚的男女共有三十六对，童养媳没有了，妇女受虐待的情形也逐渐没有了。妇女们都积极地参加农业生产。很多妇女都学会了犁田、耙田和莳田、插秧等工作，妇女的社会地位也因之大大提高了。今年的卫生运动开展后，各乡农民都注意了室内、室外和厕所、阴沟的清洁。特别是毛主席住过的叶坪村，村里的每个院落都很洁净，过去家家门前或者天井中间总有一个污水沟，现在都已垫没了。由于两个乡都已实行了土地改革，广大农民在政治上经济上翻了身，文化翻身的要求也很迫切。现在两个乡各有一所县立的完全小学，入学儿童有三百二十多人，百分之九十八的学生都是贫农、雇农和中农的子弟。叶坪全乡和沙洲坝乡的沙洲、茶亭两个行政村已设立了八所民校，每晚经常到校学习的青壮年男女农民约有五百三十多人，他们还在民校里设立了俱乐部和剧团。叶坪乡还专为老年人成立了五个读报组，定期派“小先生”读报纸给他们听。
    革命故乡的人们努力地建设着新的生活，而这种新的生活又鼓舞着他们。他们正满怀信心地从事着创造性的劳动，争取在生产建设战线上获得更加巨大的胜利！
