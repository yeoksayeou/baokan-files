The suburban districts of Beijing are currently concentrating all efforts on fighting drought, rushing planting, and protecting seedlings. Around the time the Government Administration Council issued its directive on drought resistance on June 26th, the Beijing Suburban District Work Committee held meetings of district heads and district agricultural and forestry section chiefs on the 25th and 26th respectively, reviewing and further deploying drought resistance work. As of July 1st, 314 cadres throughout the suburbs had formed 45 work groups and投入 themselves into this work. According to incomplete statistics from June 28th to July 1st, the entire suburban area has dug 165 brick wells, 257 earth wells, and 82 cone wells, borrowed 130 water carts; taking advantage of soil moisture to rush planting and sitting-water planting on over 35,000 mu of spring fallow land and wheat stubble land.

From June 8th to June 26th, the suburban districts of Beijing did not experience any rain, resulting in a widespread drought. According to rough statistics before the rain on the 26th, the entire area had over 70,000 mu of spring fallow land and wheat stubble land that could not be sown due to drought; approximately 2 million mu of paddy fields were threatened by drought. In areas with a severe drop in the groundwater level, there was also the phenomenon of wells drying up. For example, in Baicaowa and Xingzhuang villages in the Twelfth District, 62 out of 67 wells had dried up, and in Lijiayu village, 24 out of 29 wells had dried up. In addition, seedling deaths of cotton, beans, and other crops have been found in some areas. After the rain on June 27th, rainfall was not thorough in the suburban districts of the city. The areas with the most rainfall, such as the Twelfth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Districts, received only two to five 指 (a traditional measurement unit, about the width of fingers), so drought resistance, rushing planting, and seedling protection remain a serious struggle for the suburban districts of Beijing.

The drought prevention and resistance work in the suburban districts of Beijing this spring achieved certain results, but after the spring plowing and sowing were basically completed, the leading cadres in the suburban districts relaxed their attention to drought prevention, thus forming today's passive situation. Currently, the main problems in the drought resistance work in the suburban districts of Beijing are as follows:

First, most areas feel that the water source is insufficient. Although the suburban districts of the city dug 328 new wells and repaired 832 old wells in this spring's drought prevention and resistance, there was an insufficient estimation of this year's summer drought situation, resulting in some wells drying up or approaching dryness. Some areas also have the phenomenon of insufficient wells to meet the water needs of the masses.

Second, some people have superstitious ideas of relying on the heavens and 麻痹 (numbed) waiting thoughts. For example, some farmers in Shichang in the Sixteenth District secretly carried the clay Buddha in the temple out to expose it to the sun to pray for rain before this rain. Some farmers in Xiazhuang village in the Fifteenth District and other villages believe that: It doesn't matter if it doesn't rain now. In another 20 days when it rains, they can still plant late corn for 60 days to supplement their families.

In light of the above situation, the Beijing Suburban District Work Committee has decided to make the drought resistance struggle the overriding central task of the current suburban districts and instructed all districts to fully mobilize the masses in leading the drought resistance struggle, paying particular attention to dispelling the masses' 麻痹 (numbed) thoughts of relying on the heavens for rain. At the same time, it pointed out that all districts should vigorously open up water sources in the drought resistance struggle. For wells with insufficient water sources, mobilize the masses to carry out cone wells; in areas with few wells, dig new brick wells and pit-bottom wells (digging wells in dried-up pits); mobilize the masses to think about water sources and look for water sources in areas where it is estimated that there may be buried water sources, and also pay attention to strengthening the utilization of existing wells, improving the management of water carts and wells, and improving irrigation efficiency. (Jin Yu) Do a good job in irrigation management and carry out the drought resistance struggle.

Recently, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an urgent call to action in response to the drought situation in various regions, calling for launching a drought resistance struggle. Cadres and farmers in all drought-stricken areas and potentially drought-stricken areas should actively mobilize and respond to this call, ensuring that "not a single mu of land is left barren and not a single seedling dies." In addition to organizing to rush planting and protect seedlings, fully utilizing all water sources, and building water conservancy projects, these areas should also pay special attention to using all existing irrigation equipment, strengthening management, saving water, expanding the irrigated area, and improving irrigation efficiency.

1. Strengthen the leadership of management work in irrigation areas. At present, due to prolonged drought and lack of rain, the land in many areas is showing signs of drought, and the river flow has therefore dropped sharply. Judging from the situation of several rivers before the recent rains: near Weijia Xiaobao Village in the Sanggan River within the territory of Chahar Province, the river flow in the same period last year was 7.8 cubic meters per second, while this year it is less than 1 cubic meter per second; near Guantai in the Zhang River within the territory of Hebei Province, the river flow in the same period last year was 23.3 cubic meters per second, but now it is only 13.5 cubic meters per second; the Hutuo River, Yongding River, Daqing River, and Tang River within the territory of Hebei Province are currently cut off; and the water in the Jiyun River has also decreased a lot. The land irrigated by river water in these areas has experienced the phenomenon of not being able to draw water for irrigation due to insufficient river flow. The drought situation of crops is serious, and some have withered and died. After the rain on June 27th, the situation of the above-mentioned rivers, except for the increase in water volume of the Sanggan River and Yongding River, which should be paid attention to and utilized, the remaining rivers have not changed significantly. Therefore, the production and drought prevention offices, water conservancy, and river affairs leadership departments at all levels in these areas should pay special attention to strengthening the leadership of irrigation management work, and it is best to organize a certain force to go deep into irrigation areas such as wells and canals to conduct a general inspection to grasp the irrigation and drought situation of each irrigation area. If problems such as insufficient water volume, improper water use, and water disputes are found, they should be studied in detail and resolved quickly. At the same time, each irrigation area in the same river system should be closely linked, uniformly allocate water volume, and overcome all selfish departmentalism. All localities must make full use of the various irrigation facilities that have been completed and overcome the phenomenon of abandonment or insufficient utilization. In many areas, the leading departments only emphasize digging new wells and lack specific guidance on the use of old wells. The water conservancy organs in some irrigation areas do not pay attention to the management of canal water use, and even there are still feudal forces controlling water conservancy; in addition, farmers use water improperly, resulting in a large waste of water. All of these should be given our utmost attention, and we should quickly find ways to improve them.

2. Carry out a mass movement of water conservation and promote various simple and reasonable irrigation methods. Although the irrigation management work in some areas has undergone democratic reform, because political education and technical guidance to the masses are not enough, some people still use the old water use methods and systems, and the phenomenon of wasting water is very serious. Therefore, these areas must educate farmers to use water scientifically, strengthen patriotic education and the education of "farmers all over the world are one family," overcome selfish departmentalism among cadres and the masses, and correct the incorrect water use habit of "the more water you pour, the better." All localities should organize and lead farmers to implement unity and mutual assistance, reasonably use existing water volume, sign water conservation conventions, and launch a movement to cherish water volume. The administrative leaders in these areas, together with the cadres of water conservancy management agencies and farmer representatives, should jointly formulate a reasonable water allocation plan according to the needs of crops. Attention should also be paid to reducing leakage, concentrating water volume, accelerating the irrigation cycle rate, and uniformly controlling the water use for seedling protection and sowing in partially arid areas when the water level drops.

Many agricultural production labor models have created many simple, reasonable, effective irrigation methods in their actual work. For example, shallow watering, frequent watering, night watering, and ditch watering. This has played a significant role in saving water, expanding the irrigated area, and increasing yield per unit area. All localities should vigorously promote implementation. At the same time, we should further give play to the creativity of the masses, summarize and promote new water use methods in a timely manner, cultivate models, and establish model banners for water conservation among the masses.

In short, the current season is the most urgent season for farmland water needs. All localities must widely mobilize in this situation of less rain and water shortage, strengthen irrigation management work, fully utilize all irrigation facilities, give full play to the potential of water, and actively fight against drought.

    北京郊区大力抗旱已抢种三万五千多亩
    北京市郊各区目前正集中一切力量进行抗旱抢种和保苗工作。六月二十六日政务院发布抗旱指示的前后，京市郊区工作委员会在二十五、六两日分别召开了各区区长和各区农林科长会议，检查了和进一步布置了抗旱工作。到七月一日止，全郊区已有三百十四个干部组成了四十五个工作组投入这一工作。根据六月二十八日到七月一日不完全的统计，全郊区共打砖井一百六十五眼、打土井二百五十七眼，锥井八十二眼，贷水车一百三十辆；趁墒抢种和趁墒坐水点种春白地、麦茬地三万五千亩以上。
    北京市郊各区从六月八日到二十六日始终没有下雨，因而普遍呈现干旱现象。据二十六日雨前粗略的统计，全区共有因干旱不能下种的春白地和麦茬地七万多亩；有约二百万亩稻田受到干旱的威胁。在地下水位严重下降的地区并有水井干涸的现象。如十二区的白草洼、幸庄两个村的六十七眼水井，已有六十二眼干涸，李家峪村的二十九眼井已干了二十四眼。此外，部分地区并已发现旱死棉花、豆子等幼苗的现象。在六月二十七日下雨后，市郊各区都未下透，下雨最多的地区如十二、十四、十五、十六等区也只下两三指到五指不等，因此，抗旱抢种和保苗工作，仍是目前北京市郊区一个严重的斗争任务。
    北京市郊区今年春天的防旱抗旱工作曾获得一定成绩，但在春耕播种基本结束以后，市郊各区的领导干部就放松了对防旱工作的注意，因此形成了今天的被动局面。目前北京市郊区在抗旱工作中主要的有下面两个问题：
    第一是多数地区感到水源不足。市郊区在今春防旱、抗旱中虽曾打新井三百二十八眼，修旧井八百三十二眼，但是对今年夏旱的情况估计不足，致有部分水井已经干涸或接近干涸。有的地区也有因水井过少不敷群众用水需要的现象。
    第二是部分群众有迷信靠天和麻痹等待思想。如十六区石厂的部分农民在这次下雨前曾偷偷把庙里的泥佛抬出暴晒求雨。十五区夏庄等村有的农民认为：现在不下雨不要紧，再过二十天下雨，还能种六十天还家的晚玉米。
    根据上述情况，北京市郊区工作委员会已决定以抗旱斗争为当前市郊区压倒一切的中心任务，并指示各区在领导抗旱斗争中要充分发动群众，特别是注意解除群众靠天等雨的麻痹思想。同时指出各区在抗旱斗争中应大力开辟水源，对水源不足的井发动群众进行锥井；在水井少的地区打新砖井和坑底井（在已干的水坑内打井）；在估计可能有埋藏水源的地区发动群众想水源和寻找水源，同时注意加强对现有水井的利用，改善对水车水井的管理，提高灌溉效率。（近宇）做好灌溉管理工作进行抗旱斗争
    最近中央人民政府政务院针对各地干旱情况，发布了紧急动员起来，开展抗旱斗争的指示。一切干旱地区和可能发生干旱地区的干部和农民，都应积极动员起来，响应这个号召，做到“不荒一亩地，不死一棵禾苗”。这些地区除了必须组织起来，实行抢种保苗，充分利用一切水源，兴修水利外，并应特别注意使用一切现有灌溉设备，加强管理，节约水量，扩大浇地面积，提高灌溉效能。
    一、加强对灌溉区管理工作的领导。目前因久旱缺雨，许多地区的土地已呈干旱现象，河水流量因而骤减。就几个河流在最近下雨以前的情况来看：察哈尔省境内桑乾河尉家小堡村附近，去年同期河水流量为七点八秒立方公尺，今年不足一秒立方公尺；河北省境内漳河观台附近，去年同期河水流量为二十三点三秒立方公尺，现在只有十三点五秒立方公尺；河北省境内滹沱河、永定河、大清河、唐河目前都已断流；蓟运河的水也减少了很多。这些地区引用河水灌溉的土地，已发生因河水流量不足而不能引水浇地的现象。庄禾旱象严重，有的已枯萎而死。六月二十七日各地下雨以后，上述各个河流的情况，除桑乾河、永定河的水量增加应注意利用外，其余各河都没有显著变化。因此这些地区的各级生产防旱办公室、水利及河务等领导部门，应该特别注意加强灌溉管理工作的领导，最好组织一定力量，深入到水井、渠道等灌溉区，进行一次普遍检查，掌握各个灌溉区的浇地和干旱情况，如果发现水量不足、用水不当和水利纠纷等问题，应详加研究，迅速解决。同时，同一河系的各个灌溉区应紧密联系，统一分配水量，克服一切自私本位思想。各地必须充分利用已经完成的各种灌溉设施，克服放弃不用或不充分利用的现象。有许多地区的领导部门，只强调打新井，对旧井的使用缺乏具体领导。有的灌溉区的水利机关对渠道用水的管理工作毫不重视，甚至仍有封建势力把持着水利的现象；加以农民用水不当，因而浪费了大量的水。这些都应当引起我们极度重视，迅速设法加以改进。
    二、开展群众性的爱水、节水运动，推行各种简易合理的灌溉方法。有些地区的灌溉管理工作，虽已经过民主改革，但是因为对群众的政治教育和技术指导不够，有的群众仍沿用着旧的用水方法和制度，浪费水量现象非常严重。因此，这些地区必须教育农民科学用水，加强爱国主义教育和“天下农民是一家”的教育，克服干部和群众中的本位自私思想，改正“多浇就好”的不正确的用水习惯。各地应组织领导农民，实行团结互助，合理地使用现有水量，订立爱水使水公约，开展一个珍惜水量的运动。这些地区的行政领导干部，连同水利管理机构的干部、农民代表等，应按照农作物的需要，共同作出合理的配水计划。并应注意减少渗漏，集中水量，加速灌溉循环率，统一掌握水位低落时部分干旱区保苗播种的用水。
    很多农业生产劳动模范在实际工作当中，创造出不少简易合理行之有效的灌溉方法。例如浅浇、勤浇、夜浇、沟浇等。这在节约水量，扩大灌溉面积，提高单位面积产量上，起了很大作用。各地应大力推广实行。同时应进一步地发挥群众创造能力，及时总结推广新的用水方法，培养典型，树立群众中间的节约用水的模范旗帜。
    总之，目前是农田需水最迫切的季节，各地必须在这少雨缺水的情况下，广泛动员起来，加强灌溉管理工作，充分利用一切灌溉设施，发挥水的潜在能力，积极和干旱斗争。
