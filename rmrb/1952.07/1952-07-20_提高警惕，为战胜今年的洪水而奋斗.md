    Since the beginning of July, most parts of the country have experienced rainfall. Although the rainfall distribution is uneven, and drought conditions have not been alleviated in some areas, there is still the possibility of heavy rainfall occurring at any time in this period of rapid weather changes. To protect the people's livelihood and agricultural production, we must raise vigilance and prevent floods. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should lead the people in their respective regions, and based on the flood prevention work instructions issued by the Central Flood Control Headquarters on June 20th, inspect and strengthen the leadership of flood prevention work, and strive to overcome the floods.
    The large-scale development of water conservancy construction over the past three years has unprecedentedly strengthened the flood defense works of most rivers in our country, and the fundamental management of some of the rivers most severely affected by floods has begun. This provides a strong material guarantee for flood prevention work. The people of all regions have also gained certain experience and organizational foundations for flood prevention work; rainfall and hydrological measurement stations have been established on all important rivers, and a system for reporting rainfall and water conditions via telegrams and telephones has been established, increasing the initiative and foresight of flood prevention work to a certain extent. These are all favorable conditions for this year's flood prevention work. However, precisely because of these favorable conditions, complacency or paralyzing thoughts can easily arise among our cadres and the masses, which is our ideological enemy in flood prevention work.
    According to the preliminary inspection by the Central Flood Control Headquarters, although some achievements have been made in this year's flood prevention work in various regions, paralyzing thoughts still exist to varying degrees in some areas. For example, during the rainfall in early July, the water levels of rivers in some areas rose sharply, exceeding the danger level. The Central Flood Control Headquarters has already received reports, but the local flood prevention work authorities have not yet grasped the detailed situation. This is enough to prove that although some regions have established flood prevention command organizations, they do not have dedicated personnel responsible for checking and reporting rainfall and water conditions daily, making the flood prevention organization a mere formality. Among the areas that suffered from floods before July, 60% were due to flash floods after heavy rains, which were caught off guard. In some areas, many small weirs were destroyed, and houses, livestock were washed away, even causing the death of some people. This also shows that some regions have not taken comprehensive care in the organization and leadership of flood prevention, focusing only on the construction and defense of dikes in the middle and lower reaches, while neglecting to mobilize and organize the people in the upstream mountainous areas to take temporary measures to prevent floods in rivers and valleys where no engineering works have been built. In addition, some believe that floods will not occur because of the powerful engineering, or neglect the preparation of flood prevention work because there has been no rainfall in the local area. These should be quickly corrected.
    Judging from the recent rainfall situation, the tense stage of nationwide flood prevention work is approaching. To thoroughly overcome paralyzing thoughts, raise vigilance, and overcome possible flood disasters, we believe that all regions must step up flood prevention measures. We cannot relax our flood prevention efforts because major rivers across the country, such as the Huai River, have already begun fundamental management, and the Yangtze River and the Yellow River have also undergone major projects in recent years, thinking that these rivers will not have problems. It must be seen that although the Huai River has begun fundamental management, the entire project has not yet been completed, and flood storage and discharge have not been completely controlled. In case of the largest flood, the existing engineering equipment can only ensure that the main areas are not affected by floods. The entire Huai River basin must still rely on strong defense to strive to reduce disasters, and most of the newly built projects have not been tested by floods, so there is no room for the slightest negligence in how to manage and use them. The Beijindi flood detention project of the Yellow River and the Jingjiang flood diversion project of the Yangtze River play a significant role in ensuring the safety of people's lives, but these projects cannot control all the floods of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. Therefore, flood prevention work on the Yangtze River and the Yellow River is still our most serious task at present. If there is any negligence in these tasks, we will make a major mistake. There are also many medium-sized rivers that are still seriously threatened by flood disasters because they have not yet begun fundamental management. All regions must also give play to the enthusiasm of flood control work over the past three years, with leaders taking the lead and the masses bravely defending the dikes and striving to reduce flood disasters.
    In addition to river flood prevention, fighting against mountain flash floods and local torrential rains causing waterlogging disasters is also one of our important tasks. Over the past three years, our people's government has led the people in restoring and constructing water conservancy projects with a focus. We first started with the rivers that are most urgently needed and have the greatest impact, and have not yet had time to comprehensively solve the disasters of mountain floods and waterlogging. However, as long as we strengthen the leadership of this work, we can still avoid or mitigate disasters in this area. General river flood prevention is mostly based on reports of upstream river water rises and falls to alert the downstream. To prevent mountain flood and waterlogging disasters, we must take a step ahead and guide work based on weather and rainfall conditions. All regions can provide meteorological analysis and forecasts through senior flood prevention agencies based on local conditions, or the responsible agencies of special districts and counties can grasp local rainfall conditions and promptly awaken the people to raise their vigilance. This work has not been done much in the past and should be strengthened this year. Shandong has tried the method of "gully dams" to prevent mountain floods and has achieved results. The Huai River basin has tried to excavate ditches and gullies to drain waterlogging, and southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui have carried out large-scale organized drainage, all of which have achieved certain results. These are simple and easy to implement, and even doing a little can achieve some results. All regions can study and summarize the historical experience of the local people's struggle against floods in combination with the interests of the masses, and experiment and promote them in a guided manner based on local conditions. At a minimum, the mobilization and organization of the people in the mountainous areas upstream of each river to prevent flood disasters must not be relaxed to avoid significant losses of people's lives and property.
    The main force of flood prevention work relies on the masses and organizes the masses; the main weapon of flood prevention work is various projects to control and defend against floods; the eyes and ears of flood prevention are various systems for investigating and reporting rainfall and water conditions. On the eve of the nationwide flood prevention work entering a tense stage, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of these tasks. All areas that have already experienced floods should seize the intermittent time of the floods to conduct inspections and necessary repairs. In the northeast and parts of North China, where there has been a long drought and no rain, some rivers have dried up, and some dikes have been dug up during the drought resistance period to divert water for irrigation. It is even more necessary to consider in advance the serious situation that may occur when the river first flows after rainfall and take preventive measures early. The instructions and notices of the Central Flood Control Headquarters for the 1952 flood prevention work pointed out that in order to closely combine flood prevention and drought prevention work and avoid the phenomenon of neglecting one or the other, flood prevention and drought prevention should be unified under the leadership of the local responsible leader, and flood prevention agencies at all levels must set up dedicated personnel to check water and rain conditions daily, find problems, and raise the attention of the leadership. These systems should be implemented by all regions.
    Now the flood season has come nationwide. Flood prevention work is an in-depth and meticulous organizational work, and it is also an arduous and tense combat work. Whether flood prevention work can be victorious is an important key to whether we can achieve victory on the agricultural production front this year. The people of the whole country must oppose paralysis, raise vigilance, and fight to overcome the coming floods.

### 提高警惕，为战胜今年的洪水而奋斗

    提高警惕，为战胜今年的洪水而奋斗
    全国绝大部分地区七月上旬以来都已经落雨了。虽然雨量分布不匀，还有部分地区旱象没有解除，但是在这气候晴雨变化最急骤的时期，各地随时又都有发生暴雨的可能。为了保障人民生活和农业生产，我们必须提高警惕，防范洪水，各地党委和人民政府，都应领导各地人民，根据中央防汛总指挥部在六月二十日发出的防汛工作指示，检查并加强对防汛工作的领导，为战胜洪水而奋斗。
    三年以来水利建设事业大规模的发展，使我国多数河流的防御工程都得到了空前的加强，一部分遭受水灾最重的河流并已开始根本的治理，这给防汛工作提供了强大的物质保证。各地人民对于防汛工作也已经有了一定的经验和组织基础；各重要河流都设立了雨量、水文的测量站，并建立起用电报电话报告雨情水情的制度，使防汛工作在一定限度内增加了主动性和预见性，这都是今年防汛工作的有利的条件。但是正因为有了这些有利条件，在我们的干部和群众当中，也就容易滋生自满或麻痹的思想，这是我们在防汛工作中的思想上的敌人。
    根据中央防汛总指挥部初步的检查，各地今年的防汛工作，虽然已经取得一部分成绩，但是麻痹的思想在有些地区还是或多或少地存在着的。比如，在七月上旬降雨的时候，有些地区的河流水位暴涨，超出危险水位以上，中央防汛总指挥部已经得到报告，而当地防汛工作负责机关还没有掌握详细的情况。这足以证明，我们有些地区虽然成立了防汛指挥机关，可是没有专管人员逐日负责检查雨情水情的报告，使防汛组织流于形式。在七月以前发生水灾的部分地区当中，有百分之六十是由于大雨之后，山洪暴发，猝不及防，有些地区并且冲毁了很多小型的堰塘，冲走了房屋牲畜，甚至造成一部分人民的死亡。这又可说明，有些地区在防汛的组织和领导上还没有照顾全面，只是着重了中下游堤防工程的修守，而忽略了动员组织上游山区的人民，对于没有修筑工程的河流溪谷进行预防水患的临时措置。此外，因为做了强大的工程，就认为不会发生水灾，或者因为当地还没有落雨，就疏忽了防汛工作的准备。这些都是应该迅速纠正的。
    按照最近降雨的情况来看，全国性防汛工作的紧张阶段即将到来。为了彻底克服麻痹思想，提高警惕，战胜可能发生的洪水灾害，我们认为各地都必须加紧进行防汛的措施。我们不能因为全国较大的河流如淮河已经开始进行根本的治理，长江黄河这几年也做了较大的工程，因此就认为这些河流不会发生问题，而松懈了防汛的努力。必须看到淮河虽然已经开始进行根本的治理，可是全部工程尚未完成，洪水蓄泄还没有受到完全的控制，万一遇到最大的洪水，现有的工程设备，只能保障主要地区不受水灾。全部淮河流域还必须依靠大力防守来争取减少灾害，并且新建的工程多数没有经过洪水的考验，如何管理运用，更不容有丝毫疏忽。黄河的北金堤滞洪工程，长江的荆江分洪工程，对于保障人民生活的安全是有重大作用的，但是这些工程还不能控制长江、黄河的全部洪水。因此对于长江、黄河的防汛工作，目前还是我们最严重的任务，假如在这些工作上有任何的疏忽，就要犯重大的错误。还有许多中等河流，因为没有开始根本的治理，还受着洪水灾害的严重威胁。各地还必须发挥三年来防洪工作的积极性，领导带头，群众奋勇，英勇地守护堤埝，争取减少洪水灾害。
    除河流的防汛以外，对于山洪暴发和局部暴雨所造成的内涝灾害进行斗争，也是我们的重要任务之一。三年来，我们的人民政府领导人民恢复和建设水利事业，是有重点的。首先从需要最切、影响最大的河流着手，还没有来得及全面地解决山洪和内涝的灾害。但是只要加强对于这一工作的领导，我们仍然可以免除或减轻这一方面的灾害。一般河流防汛，大抵都是根据上游河水涨落情况的报告，以提起下游的注意，关于防止山洪内涝的灾害，则必须提前一步，根据气象和落雨的情况指导工作。各地可根据当地条件，由高级防汛机构供给气象的分析预报，或由专区和县负责机关掌握当地落雨情况，及时唤起人民提高警惕。这一工作过去做得不多，今年应该注意加强。山东防止山洪曾试行“闸山沟”的办法，已有成绩，淮河流域为排泄内涝试行开挖沟洫，苏南皖南等地进行大规模的有组织的排水，也都收到一定成效。这些都是简而易行的，做一点也就可以有一点的成绩。各地可以根据当地具体情况，结合群众利益，研究总结当地群众与水灾斗争的历史经验，有领导地试验推广。最低限度，对于各河上游山地人民防止洪水灾害的动员组织工作绝对不可放松，以避免人民生命财产的重大损失。
    防汛工作的主要力量，是依靠群众，组织群众；防汛工作的主要武器，是控制和防御洪水的各种工程；防汛的耳目是调查报告雨情水情的各种制度。在全国防汛工作进入紧张阶段的前夜，对于这些工作进行一次普遍深入的检查，是十分必要的。凡是已经发生洪水的地区，应该抓住洪水的间歇时间，进行检查和必要的修整。在东北和华北一部分久旱未雨的地区，有的河流已经干涸，有的抗旱时期曾经掘开堤防，引水灌溉，更必须预先考虑到降雨以后河道第一次行水可能发生的严重情况，早作预防的措置。中央防汛总指挥部一九五二年防汛工作的指示和通知中曾经指出，为了使防汛和防旱的工作密切结合，不至于发生顾此失彼的现象，防汛和防旱应该由地方负责首长统一领导，各级防汛机构必须设置专管人员，逐日检查水情雨情，发见问题，以提起领导上的注意，这些制度各地应该贯彻执行。
    现在全国范围的洪水季节已经来了。防汛工作是一个深入的细密的组织工作，也是一个艰苦的紧张的战斗工作。防汛工作能否获得胜利，是我们今年在农业生产的战线上能否获得胜利的一个重要关键。全国人民要反对麻痹，提高警惕，为战胜即将到来的洪水而斗争。
