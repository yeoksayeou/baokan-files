Title: Situation on the Eve of the U.S. Democratic National Convention

Xinhua News Agency, New York: The U.S. Democratic National Convention is scheduled to open in Chicago on July 21. More than 1,200 delegates will attend the convention. Just like the Republican situation, most of the delegates are party bosses and their loyal supporters, corporate lawyers, congressmen, and big businessmen. They obtained delegate seats by donating to the party's funds.

    The main difference between the Democratic Convention and the Republican Convention is that many union bureaucrats from the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor are participating in the convention. They collude with the Democratic Party's machinery, attempting to make ordinary workers believe that they can realize their ideals through the Democratic Party and should therefore avoid independent political action. According to "The New York Times," there are about 100 leaders from the CIO among the delegates, including CIO President Murray. There are also many bureaucrats from the AFL among the delegates, including two AFL vice presidents—Harrison of the Railway Clerks Union and Petrillo of the Musicians Union.

    Like the delegates attending the Republican National Convention, these delegates (including union representatives) were elected in the same undemocratic manner. Only a very small number of delegates attending the convention are directly elected. Most of the rest are elected by state and county party conventions, which, as "U.S. News & World Report" magazine recently stated, means that they are actually appointed by state and district party bosses.

    As at the recent Republican National Convention, the party bosses will make all the actual decisions of the Democratic National Convention.

    When making decisions at the convention, they will not only consider the party's fate in this election campaign but also pay close attention to the wishes of the financial tycoons and industrial giants who support them. Therefore, although the Democratic leaders are skilled at deceiving the people and have union bureaucrats and pseudo-liberals participating in the Democratic convention, the Democratic Party is fundamentally just as much a tool of big financial groups as the Republican Party.

    Although the largest financial capital groups have indicated this year that they favor the Republican Party and Eisenhower, they have little reason to be dissatisfied with the Democratic Party under Truman's leadership. As Democratic leaders have repeatedly boasted, under the rule of the Democratic government, which claims to promote the people's happiness, big business is more prosperous than ever. American progressives point out that if the financial oligarchs now decisively decide that they will first choose Eisenhower as their presidential candidate, it is simply because they believe that Eisenhower can adopt more blatant and straightforward means of rule than the Democrats, because he has not made any promises to union bureaucrats and pseudo-liberals. But financial giants are not exclusively fond of one party; they are unwilling to "put all their eggs in one basket." They do not think that the Democratic Party under the current leadership is entirely undesirable. Many of them are very willing to make smart investments in the Democratic campaign, because they believe that the Democratic Party's deceptive tactics may enable the Democratic Party to win like in the 1948 election. "Pan American Airlines," which is recognized as belonging to the Morgan consortium, provides a good example to illustrate how this double-dealing is played.

    "Pan American Airlines," through its Vice Chairman Prio and Director Ingalls, maintains very close ties with the Republican leadership; Prio himself is the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Ingalls is the host of Taft's campaign. On the other hand, "Pan American Airlines" also pays close attention to maintaining contact with the Democratic leadership. The company still employs the law firm of former Secretary of Defense and former Chairman of the Democratic National Finance Committee, Johnson, as its legal counsel in Washington. According to an article published by American journalists Alsop brothers in the "New York Herald Tribune" a few months ago, "Pan American Airlines'" other "friends" in the Democratic Party include former Attorney General and current Supreme Court Justice Clark, former Attorney General McGrath, and Senator McCarran.

    Wall Street financier Harriman is actively participating in the Democratic campaign, and he is striving to be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. This situation and the list of donors to the last Democratic National campaign are also sufficient to prove that the Democratic Party has no shortage of friends on Wall Street. Those who made large donations to the Democratic Party in the 1950 congressional campaign included: Oudlen, chairman of the board of Walti Aircraft Company, which received billions of dollars in military orders, and chairman of the board of Atlas Company (a financial company closely related to the Morgan consortium); Cardell, chairman of the board of "International Electric Stock Company" controlled by Morgan and director of Citibank; Fairchild, director of "Pan American Airlines" and "International Business Machines Corporation"; Smith, chairman of the board of "American Airlines," and so on.

    American broadcasting commentator Allen said when commenting on the monopoly capitalists' funding of the Democratic Party's last campaign: "Those who donate to fund the Democratic Party actually include pivotal figures in industry and finance."

    Therefore, although there is currently little concrete news about the secret negotiations that are shaping the decisions of the Democratic Convention, one can confidently conclude that the forces that actively promoted Eisenhower's nomination in the Republican Party are now also working silently within the Democratic Party. Wall Street is trying its best to ensure its own invisible control over these two "big parties" at the same time, to ensure that no matter who wins the "political ball game" this year, it can continue to direct government policies.

    As the commentary in the latest issue of "The Nation" magazine said: "The kind of behind-the-scenes forces that support Eisenhower will probably also designate a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, so that even if the cost of the campaign cannot be reduced to a minimum, at least the risk of the campaign will be reduced to a minimum."

    On the surface, the struggle for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination is very chaotic, and it can even be said to be anarchic. At the Republican Convention, it was a clearly defined struggle between two competitors—Eisenhower and Taft, but in the competition to be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate or those who may participate in this competition, there are at least a dozen Democratic politicians.

    Truman's silence has strengthened this obvious confusion. Truman, as the president and nominal leader of the party, has great power to support someone, and his opinion is very important when deciding on the next presidential candidate. But while Truman has announced that he himself does not want to participate in the election, he has not said a word about who he actually favors.

    Currently, from the flood of rumors and denials coming from newspapers and the headquarters of various presidential hopefuls, it is not possible to draw any obvious conclusions, but perhaps the following conclusion can be an exception, namely: the senior party bosses have not yet clearly selected that person, and the "backroom deals" are still under negotiation.

    There are now five people who have openly declared that they want to compete for the Democratic presidential nomination: Harriman (a Wall Street financier who is currently managing the plan to arm America's allies and vassal states), 74-year-old Vice President Barkley, oil tycoon Kerr (who is involved in numerous scandals), Tennessee Senator Kefauver, and Georgia Senator Russell (a representative of Democratic Party members in the southern United States who hold racist views). In addition to these five people, Democratic National Committee Chairman McKinney also named six other politicians at a press conference on July 15, whose names may also be brought up at the convention.

    Among these people, no one at the convention has yet received a number of votes close to the 616 votes needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination. According to a recent Associated Press statistic, Kefauver currently seems confident of getting 267 votes, more than any other hopeful.

    Because the situation is so chaotic, a speculation is reviving, which says that the convention may "draft" Truman to run, although he has directly stated that he does not want to be nominated. At the same time, the saying that Illinois Governor Stevenson may be "drafted" continues to circulate, and Democratic party bosses believe that he is the most acceptable to monopoly capitalists and can get along with the various factions within the party.

    American newspapers have occasionally hinted that some Democratic leaders do not object to losing in the general election and allowing Wall Street's darling General Eisenhower to easily enter the White House.

    Truman himself once expressed his approval of Eisenhower as his successor.

    美国民主党全国代表大会开幕前夕情况
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：美国民主党全国代表大会定于七月二十一日在芝加哥开幕。参加大会的代表将达一千二百余人。正像共和党的情况一样，大部分代表都是党魁和他们的忠实支持者、公司律师、议员与大商人。他们靠捐助党的经费而获得了代表席位。
    民主党大会和共和党大会主要的不同点是，有产业职工联合会与美国劳工联合会的许多工会官僚参加大会，他们与民主党的党机器相勾结，企图使一般工人相信，工人们可以通过民主党而实现他们的理想，因而应该避免进行独立的政治行动。据“纽约时报”说，在代表中有产联的大约一百名负责人，其中包括产联主席莫莱。代表中还有劳联的许多官僚，其中有劳联的两个副主席——铁路职员工会的哈里逊和音乐师工会的皮特里洛。
    像出席共和党全国代表大会的代表一样，这些代表（包括工会代表在内）都是用同样不民主的方式选出来的。出席代表大会的代表只有极少数是直接选出来的。其余大部分都是州和县的党代表大会选出来的，就像“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近所说的那样，这意味着他们实际上是州与区的党魁派定的。
    像在最近的共和党全国代表大会上一样，民主党全国代表大会上党的魁首们将作出大会的各项实际决定。
    他们在作出大会的决定时，不但要顾到党在这次竞选运动中的命运，还要密切注意支持他们的金融大亨和工业巨头们的愿望。所以，尽管民主党领袖们长于欺骗人民，并有工会官僚和伪自由主义者参加民主党的代表大会，但是民主党基本上与共和党同样是大金融集团的工具。
    虽然最大的金融资本集团今年已表明它们属意于共和党和艾森豪威尔，但是它们并没有多大理由不满杜鲁门领导下的民主党。正像民主党领袖一再吹嘘的那样，在自命促进人民幸福的民主党政府的统治下，大公司的生意比以往任何时候都更兴隆了。美国进步人士指出，如果金融寡头们现在断然决定，他们首先要选择艾森豪威尔作为他们的总统候选人，那无非是因为他们相信艾森豪威尔能够采取比民主党人更加明目张胆而直截了当的统治手段，因为他没有向工会官僚和伪自由主义者提出任何诺言。但是金融巨头们并不是专对一党垂青的，他们不愿意“孤注一掷”。他们并不认为在目前领导机构领导下的民主党是完全要不得的东西。他们当中有许多人很愿意对民主党的竞选运动进行聪明的投资，因为他们认为民主党欺世惑人的手段也许能使民主党像在一九四八年的选举中一样获胜。被公认为属于摩根财团的“泛美航空公司”提供了一个很好的例子足以说明这种两面手法是怎样耍的。
    “泛美航空公司”通过它的副董事长普里奥和董事英戈尔斯与共和党的领导集团保持着极密切的联系；普里奥本人是前任共和党全国委员会主席，英戈尔斯则是塔夫脱竞选活动的主持人。另一方面，
    “泛美航空公司”又很注意与民主党的领导集团保持联系。该公司仍请前国防部长、前民主党全国财政委员会主席詹逊的律师事务所作为该公司在华盛顿的法律顾问。据美国记者阿尔索普兄弟几个月前在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表的一篇文章说，“泛美航空公司”在民主党中的其他“友好”还有前司法部长、现任最高法院法官克拉克，前任司法部长麦格拉斯和参议员麦卡伦。
    华尔街金融家哈里曼积极参加民主党的竞选运动，他正在力争被提名为民主党总统候选人。这种情况以及上次民主党全国竞选运动捐款人名单也都足以证明民主党在华尔街不乏朋友。在一九五零年国会竞选运动中给民主党以大宗捐款的就有：接受数十亿美元的军事定货的沃尔梯飞机公司董事长兼阿特拉斯公司（与摩根财团有密切联系的金融公司）董事长奥德伦；受摩根控制的“国际电力股票公司”董事长兼花旗银行董事卡德尔；“泛美航空公司”和“国际商用机器公司”董事法尔契尔；“美洲航空公司”董事长史密斯等等。
    美国广播评论员艾伦在评论垄断资本家资助民主党上一次的竞选活动时说：“捐款资助民主党的人，实际上包括了工业和金融方面举足轻重的人士”。
    所以，虽然关于形成民主党大会的决定的秘密谈判目前还很少具体消息，但是人们可以有把握地断定：积极促成艾森豪威尔在共和党内获得提名的那种势力，现在也正在民主党里边不声不响地工作着。华尔街竭力想同时确保自己对于这两个“大党”的无形控制，确保不管是谁在今年的“政治球赛”中得胜，自己都能够继续指挥政府的政策。
    正像最近一期的“民族”杂志的评论中所说的那样：“支持艾森豪威尔的那一种幕后势力，大概也要给民主党指定一个总统候选人，以便即使不能把竞选运动的费用减少到最低限度，至少也要把竞选运动的风险减少到最低限度”。
    表面上看来，民主党党内提名总统候选人的斗争是非常混乱的，甚至可说是无政府的。在共和党代表大会上是两个竞争者——艾森豪威尔和塔夫脱之间壁垒分明的斗争，但是在竞争被提名为民主党总统候选人或可能参加这个竞争的人，却至少有一打民主党政客。
    杜鲁门的沉默加强了这个显明的混乱。杜鲁门作为总统和党的名义上的领袖，是有很大的力量来支持某一个人的，在决定下届总统候选人的时候，他的意见是很重要的。但是杜鲁门虽然一方面宣布他本人不想参加竞选，一方面对于他到底中意那一个人这件事却也一言不发。
    目前，从报纸和各个想当总统的人的总部所传出的传闻和辟谣的洪流里，还不可能得到任何明显的结论，但也许下面这样的结论可以例外，即：上级党魁们还没有明确选定那一个人，“密室交易”还在谈判中。
    现在有五个公开声明要竞争民主党总统候选人提名的人：哈里曼（他是华尔街的金融家，目前经管着武装美国的盟友和附庸国家的计划），七十四岁的副总统巴克莱，石油业大老板凯尔（许许多多丑闻都有他的份），田纳西州的参议员克福维尔，佐治亚州参议员鲁塞尔（他是美国南部各州抱有种族歧视见解的民主党党员的代表）。除了这五个人以外，民主党全国委员会主席麦克金尼在七月十五日的记者招待会上还举出了另外六个政客，他们的名字也可能在大会上提出。
    这些人中间，目前在大会里没有一个人已得到了接近于为赢得民主党总统候选人提名所需的六百一十六票的票数。据美联社最近的统计，克福维尔目前似乎有把握可以得到二百六十七票，超过任何其他希望当候选人的人。
    由于形势是这样混乱，有一种猜测又在复活，这猜测说大会可能“征召”杜鲁门出马，虽然他曾直截了当地表示过他不想被提名。同时，可能“征召”伊利诺斯州长史蒂文森的说法还在继续流传，民主党的党魁们认为他是最能为垄断资本家们所接受，同时又最能和党内的各个派系相处的。
    美国报纸上曾间或有过这种暗示：有些民主党领袖并不反对在大选里失败而让华尔街的宠儿艾森豪威尔将军容容易易地走进白宫。
    杜鲁门自己曾一度表示他赞成让艾森豪威尔做他的继任人。
