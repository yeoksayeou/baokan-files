    Technician Zhou Peiyu Proposes Rationalization Suggestions
    Saving the Motherland Over 160 Million Yuan
    Comrade Editor: After the commencement of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the No. 2 Factory of the Hanyang Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company in Hubei Province undertook the manufacturing of 55 winches required for controlling the floodgate doors. These winches have a major component called a worm gear, which is entirely made of cast copper, each weighing over 300 kilograms net. The higher authorities allocated a batch of super-grade pure copper to the No. 2 Factory. This pure copper has a copper content of up to 99.53%, which is a very rare and precious metal material. However, the quantity of this pure copper was not sufficient to cast 55 worm gears. Zhou Peiyu, a technician and member of the Communist Youth League, led the casting of the worm gears. One day, while claiming materials in the warehouse, he saw over 5,000 kilograms of secondary-grade pure copper, with a copper content of 95.41%. He carefully checked the composition and believed that this secondary-grade copper could be mixed in to manufacture the worm gears. He immediately raised this suggestion to the leading comrades, and it was supported by the leading comrades and the worker masses. After testing, it was proven that the worm gears cast with 70% super-grade pure copper and 30% secondary-grade pure copper had excellent performance. By manufacturing worm gears in this way, not only was the difficulty of insufficient raw materials solved, but also a wealth of 160 million yuan was saved for the motherland.

    技术员周佩瑜提出合理化建议
    给祖国节省一亿六千余万元
    编辑同志：荆江分洪工程开始后，湖北汉阳江汉船舶机械公司第二厂承制了控制进洪闸闸门所需的绞车五十五部。这种绞车上有一种主要机件，叫做蜗轮，全是由铜翻铸的，每个净重三百多公斤。上级拨给二厂一批超级纯铜，这种纯铜含铜成分达百分之九十九点五三，是一种很稀贵的金属材料。但是，这批纯铜的数量并不敷翻铸五十五个蜗轮。厂内技术员、青年团员周佩瑜领导翻铸蜗轮。一天，他在库房领料，看到有五千多公斤次级纯铜，含铜百分之九十五点四一。他就仔细作了成分检定，认为可以掺用这种次级铜来制造蜗轮。他立刻向领导同志提出这个意见，得到了领导同志和工人群众的支持。经过试验，证明用十分之七的超级纯铜和十分之三的次级纯铜铸成的蜗轮，效能很好。按照这种方法制造蜗轮，不但解决了原材料不足的困难，给祖国节约了一亿六千万元的财富。
