The Central Bureau of Private Enterprises Stipulates that Black People Trademarks are No Longer Allowed on Goods

The Private Enterprise Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, in view of the fact that some commodities in the past used black people trademarks (including names and drawn graphics), which were a kind of discrimination against the black race and had a negative impact on the people, has decided to announce the cancellation of the twenty-four black people trademarks registered in Shanghai, Jinan and other places. It is stipulated that manufacturers are allowed to ship and sell commodities already packaged with black people trademarks. The remaining packaging paper, boxes (unpacked), etc., shall be registered with the local industry and commerce bureau and used up within a limited time, and no further printing is allowed.

Farmers in Fujian Province are already harvesting early rice. This year, the people of Fujian, with their tenacious fighting spirit, overcame five flood disasters and won a bumper harvest of early rice. Of the more than 90,000 mu of early rice fields that were flooded in the lower reaches of the Minjiang, Jinjiang, and Jiulongjiang rivers, 80 percent of the rice fields can still harvest 450 jin of rice per mu. Some of them even increased production by more than 10% compared to last year.

Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region Achieves Great Results in the Patriotic Increase Production Movement

The Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region has achieved great results in carrying out the patriotic increase production movement in the past six months, and a new atmosphere that has never existed before has emerged. According to statistics from Kangding, Luding, Danba, Jiulong, Daofu, Ganzi, Yajiang and other seven counties, a total of 15,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed and all have been sown. Farmers in various places have initially improved their rough farming methods. For example, Ganzi farmers used to plow horizontally and vertically every foot, but this year they plow very densely and finely. Various places have experimented with changing from broadcasting to strip sowing and spot sowing, and have begun to use improved seed methods such as warm soup soaking and chemical seed dressing. In the past, many places did not weed, but now they generally weeded two and three times. The old habits of not accumulating fertilizer and not fertilizing the land have also changed. The above-mentioned seven counties have also built and restored more than 100 water weirs.

Women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have universally participated in agricultural production this year, which has played a significant role in the bumper harvest movement. According to incomplete statistics from the Dihua Special District, this special district alone has 11,000 women of all ethnic groups who have joined mutual aid teams for production this year. According to statistics from six agricultural townships in Luntai County, southern Xinjiang, 90 percent of the female labor force participated in the spring plowing movement.
