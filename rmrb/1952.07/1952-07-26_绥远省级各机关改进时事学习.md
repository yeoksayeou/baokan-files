    Suiyuan Provincial Organs Improve Current Affairs Study
    To the Editor: The phenomenon of neglecting reading newspapers and studying in the Suiyuan Province's organs is quite serious. On June 10th, we conducted a general current affairs test in the provincial organs and Guihua City's municipal organs, followed by democratic grading and self-criticism. This test clearly exposed the tendency of some cadres to neglect reading newspapers and studying. Of the 2,133 participants, 1,363 failed. The test questions were very simple and could be answered with regular newspaper reading. However, many people made numerous errors, and some even turned in blank papers. Regarding the International Economic Conference, many people did not know where it was held or who the Chinese representative was. Even more people could not answer the political significance of the conference. Regarding the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations, many people did not know what "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" were. The basic policy for agricultural production this year has been published in newspapers almost every day, but some cadres in the Finance Department answered "expanding cultivated land area." More seriously, a small number of cadres in the Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Department, who deal with agricultural production every day, were also clueless about this issue.
    The main reason for the above phenomenon is that some leading cadres do not pay enough attention to the current affairs study of their staff. They emphasize being busy, and neither supervise, inspect, nor establish specific study systems.
    Secondly, the general cadres do not recognize that the Party newspaper is a powerful tool for publicizing the Party's policies and guidelines and guiding work. They have not realized that without reading newspapers, it is not easy to improve their political and ideological level, and their professional work will be restricted.
    After the test, all units have begun to improve newspaper reading and study. After the test, Zhang Rugang, Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, immediately called on all cadres to read newspapers seriously and strengthen their study of current affairs policies. The Provincial Democratic Women's Federation has stipulated a system of reading newspapers for half an hour every day and holding a test once a month. The Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Department, Finance Department, etc., are also studying how to improve and restore the study system.

### 绥远省级各机关改进时事学习

    绥远省级各机关改进时事学习
    编辑同志：绥远省的机关工作人员忽视读报学习的现象相当严重。六月十日，我们在省级机关及归绥市市级机关，普遍地举行了一次时事测验，事后并进行了民主评卷和自我检讨。这次测验明显地暴露了部分干部忽视读报学习的倾向。参加测验的有二千一百三十三人，其中有一千三百六十三人不及格。测验题目是很简单的，只要平素看报，就可以答出来。但不少人答得错误百出，甚至还有人交了白卷。对于国际经济会议，不少人不知道是在那里召开的，也不知道我国代表是谁。对于这个会议的政治意义，答不上来的人就更多了。关于朝鲜停战谈判中的战俘问题，很多人不知道什么是“自愿遣返”和“甄别”。今年农业生产的基本方针，几乎每天都在报上登载着，可是财政厅有些干部却答成“扩大耕地面积”。更严重的是，每天和农业生产打交道的省府农林厅的少数干部，对这一问题也是蒙头蒙脑。
    所以产生了上述现象，主要是由于某些领导干部对工作人员的时事学习重视不够。他们强调工作忙，既不督促、检查，也不订立一定的学习制度。
    其次，一般干部还不认识党报是宣传党的方针、政策和指导工作的有力工具，他们没有体会到不读报，政治、思想水平就不易提高，业务工作就要受到限制。
    经过测验，各单位都已着手改进读报学习。省府公安厅张如岗厅长在测验后立即号召全体干部认真读报，加强时事政策学习。省民主妇女联合会已规定了每日读报半小时，每月举行一次测验的制度。省府农林厅、财政厅等也正研究健全与恢复学习制度。
