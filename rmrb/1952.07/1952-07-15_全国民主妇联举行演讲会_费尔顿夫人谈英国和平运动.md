Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a speech meeting on the 13th, inviting Mrs. Felton of Britain, winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, to report on the situation of the British women's peace movement. More than 800 people attended the speech meeting.

In her report, Mrs. Felton pointed out that as a result of the British government's implementation of the US government's policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, the living standards of the British people have been declining day by day. Therefore, British women urgently demand peace. Mrs. Felton said that last year she participated in the International Women's Investigation Group on the Atrocities of the US-Li Syngman Troops in Korea. After returning to her country, despite the persecution of the British government, she reported the truth about the atrocities of the US troops invading Korea to the broad masses of the people. This has further developed the British women's peace movement. On this year's "March 8th" Women's Day, a representative conference of British national women's organizations was held in London. The 1,600 people attending the conference represented 400,000 women. The representatives expressed the will of women from all over the country to oppose the British government's policy of preparing for war and to demand peace, and exchanged experiences with each other in order to do a better job of peace work. On June 25th of this year, hundreds of women went to Parliament to demand an end to the Korean War. Mrs. Felton said that the Chinese people love peace, and the friendship and mutual understanding between the Chinese and British people will help safeguard the cause of world peace.

    费尔顿夫人谈英国和平运动
    【新华社十四日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会在十三日举行演讲会，邀请“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人英国费尔顿夫人报告英国妇女和平运动的情况。参加演讲会的有八百多人。
    费尔顿夫人在报告中指出：英国政府执行美国政府扩军备战政策的结果，使得英国人民的生活水平日益降低，因此，英国妇女迫切要求和平。费尔顿夫人说：去年她参加了国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团，回国以后，她不顾英国政府的迫害，向广大人民报告了侵朝美军暴行的真相。这使英国妇女的和平运动有了进一步的开展。今年“三八”妇女节，在伦敦举行了英国全国各妇女组织的代表大会，出席大会的一千六百人，代表了四十万妇女。代表们都表达了各地妇女反对英国政府备战政策和要求和平的意志，并且互相交流了经验，以便把和平工作做得更好。今年六月二十五日，曾有几百妇女到议会要求结束朝鲜战争。费尔顿夫人说：中国人民是热爱和平的，中英两国人民的友好和互相了解将有助于保卫世界和平事业。
