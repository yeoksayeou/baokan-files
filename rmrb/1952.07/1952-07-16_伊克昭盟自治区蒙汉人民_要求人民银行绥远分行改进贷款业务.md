    The Mongolian and Han People of the Yikezhao League Autonomous Region
    Request the People's Bank of Suiyuan Branch to Improve Loan Services
    Editor: The loan business of the Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China in the Yikezhao League Autonomous Region has not been done well. The issued loans have failed to effectively help the people solve difficulties in production, causing dissatisfaction among many people.

    Before liberation, the people of the Suiyuan Yikezhao League suffered severely from the Kuomintang bandit gang. From 1941, the Kuomintang bandit army carried out armed reclamation here, plundering more than 100,000 mu of good pastures from Mongolian herdsmen. Many herdsmen were forced to flee. Most of the grain harvested by farmers was plundered by the Kuomintang bandit gang. Zhungeer Banner produced a maximum of 120,000 shi of grain annually, and the Kuomintang bandit gang would seize 80,000 shi in the form of exorbitant taxes and levies. The lives of the Mongolian and Han people were extremely difficult, and agricultural and pastoral production was on the verge of destruction.

    After liberation, the Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen of the Yikezhao League were emancipated. The People's Government issued a large number of loans to help them solve difficulties in production. This year alone, there were nine types of agricultural and pastoral loans, totaling 7.41 billion yuan. However, the People's Bank of Suiyuan Province still has many shortcomings in its loan work in the Yikezhao League. Therefore, the loans have not been able to fully play their due role. The people of the Yikezhao League urgently request the bank to improve its loan business.

    The most serious problem in the loan work is the delay in loan issuance, which is out of sync with the needs of production. Winter sideline loans are most suitable to be issued in October, but last year's winter sideline loans were not issued until before the Spring Festival this year. At that time, farmers were busy celebrating the Spring Festival, and after the Spring Festival, it was time to prepare for spring plowing. Such sideline loans could not play their due role. This year's draught cattle loans in Hangjin and Jung Wang Banners were only issued to farmers in May, two to three months later than the actual need. At this time, many farmers without cattle had already rented cattle from herdsmen, or signed joint farming contracts with farmers who had cattle. For example, farmer Zhang Manquan of the sixth district of Jung Wang Banner had already bought cattle on credit from others, but because the draught cattle loan was not issued in time, he had to sell the cattle to pay off the debt. Because the loan time is out of sync with production needs, it is difficult to ensure that loans are used for specific purposes. For example, when some farmers in the fourth district of Hangjin Banner received draught cattle loans, the draught cattle problem had already been solved. They used the draught cattle loans to buy cattle feed or do other things. Even more unreasonable is that although the loan is issued very late, the interest is calculated according to the time stipulated by the higher authorities. That is to say, some loan households have already borne the interest on the loan before they receive it. Some people got the loan not long before the repayment date arrived. Therefore, some farmers and herdsmen mistakenly believe that the loan is a "debt imposed" by the government and are unwilling to borrow from the bank. More than 70 million yuan of water conservancy loans were allocated to the sixth district of Jung Wang Banner this year, and the masses returned 30 million yuan in one go. What a serious phenomenon! In this way, loans not only fail to play their due role in supporting production, but also seriously affect the relationship between the government and the people.

    Why does this phenomenon occur? According to my understanding, there are several reasons:

    The Yikezhao League area is vast and transportation is inconvenient, making it objectively difficult to issue loans in a timely manner. For example, traveling through an administrative village on horseback sometimes takes two days. In this way, from the time the bank issues a loan notice, the banner People's Government sends someone to retrieve it, and then the banner, district, and village governments hold meetings, the masses discuss it, and the higher authorities approve it, it generally takes one to two months to retrieve the loan and issue it to the masses. This objective condition increases the difficulty of issuing loans in a timely manner, but this is not insurmountable.

    Secondly, the bank's grassroots organizations are not sound. In the seven banners, one county, and two directly subordinate districts of the Yikezhao League, the People's Bank has only established a branch in Dongsheng County, where the Yikezhao League People's Government is located. The loan business in other places is entrusted to government departments. The cadres of government departments do not understand the loan business, do not pay enough attention to the loan work, and various systems are not sound, which increases the chaos in the loan process.

    Finally, bank cadres do not understand the production situation in the league area and cannot accurately grasp the needs of the masses, which is also a reason for the phenomenon that loans do not meet production needs.

    I suggest that the People's Bank of Suiyuan Province pay attention to this issue and quickly study solutions. This is the urgent demand of the Mongolian and Han people of the Yikezhao League.

### 伊克昭盟自治区蒙汉人民  要求人民银行绥远分行改进贷款业务

    伊克昭盟自治区蒙汉人民
    要求人民银行绥远分行改进贷款业务
    编辑同志：中国人民银行绥远省分行在伊克昭盟自治区的贷款业务，一直没有做好。发放的贷款未能有效地帮助人民解决生产中的困难，引起很多群众的不满。
    绥远伊克昭盟人民在解放以前，受了国民党匪帮严重的蹂躏。从一九四一年起，国民党匪军在这里实行武装屯垦，掠夺了蒙古牧民十多万亩良好的牧场，许多牧民被迫流亡在外。农民收下的粮食，大部分被国民党匪帮掠夺去了。准格尔旗全年最多产粮十二万石，国民党匪帮要以苛捐杂税等形式抢走八万石。蒙汉人民的生活极度困苦，牧农业生产频于毁灭的境地。
    解放后，伊克昭盟蒙汉农牧人民都翻了身。人民政府为了帮助他们解决生产中的困难，发放了大批贷款。仅今年发放的农牧业贷款就有九种，总数达七十四亿一千万元。但是，绥远省人民银行在伊克昭盟的贷放工作中，还有很多缺点，因此，贷款还未能充分发挥应有的作用。伊盟人民迫切要求银行改进贷款业务。
    贷放工作中最严重的问题，是贷放时间过迟，和生产需要脱节。冬季副业贷款，在十月间发下为最适宜，但去年的冬季副业贷款，却到今年春节前才发下去。当时农民正忙着过春节，春节过后又该准备春耕了，这种副业贷款就不能发挥应有的作用。今年的耕牛贷款，杭锦和郡王等旗，都是在五月间才发到农民手里，比实际需要迟两三个月。这时许多没有牛的农民已经向牧民租了牛，或者和有牛的农民订了伙种合同；如郡王旗六区农民张满圈虽然已经向别人赊了牛，但因耕牛贷款迟迟没有发下，他只好把牛卖掉还了账。因为贷款时间和生产需要脱节，贷款也就很难作到专款专用了。例如，杭锦旗四区一些农民得到耕牛贷款时，耕牛问题早已解决了。他们就把耕牛贷款买了牛料，或办了其他事情。更不合理的是：贷款虽然发得很迟，但利息却按上级规定时间开始计算。这就是说，有些贷款户在拿到贷款之前，就已经负担了这笔贷款的利息。有的人得到贷款不久，归还的日期已经到了。因此有些农牧民把贷款误认为是政府“派债”，不愿向银行贷款。郡王旗六区今年分到水利贷款七千多万元，群众一次就退回了三千万元。这是多么严重的现象！这样，贷款不仅没有发挥扶助生产的应有的效果，而且严重地影响了政府和人民的关系。
    为什么会造成这种现象呢？根据我的了解，有这样几个原因：
    伊克昭盟地区辽阔，交通不便，及时发放贷款是有客观困难的。比如，骑马穿行一个行政村，有时要走两天。这样，从银行发出贷款通知书，由旗人民政府派人取回，再经过旗、区、村各级政府开会研究、群众讨论和上级批准，到领回贷款、发给群众，一般的约需一个月到两个月的时间。这种客观条件增加了及时发放贷款的困难，但这不是不可克服的。    
    其次，银行的基层组织不健全。伊盟七个旗、一个县、两个直属区，人民银行只在伊克昭盟人民政府所在地东胜县设立了一个支行。其他各地的贷款业务，是委托政府部门办理。政府部门的干部不懂得贷款业务，对贷款工作不够重视，加以各种制度又不健全，这就增加了贷款过程中的混乱现象。
    最后，银行干部不了解盟区的生产情况，不能准确地掌握群众的要求，这也是造成贷款不合生产需要的现象的一个原因。
    我建议绥远省人民银行重视这个问题，赶快研究解决办法，这是伊克昭盟蒙汉人民的迫切要求。
