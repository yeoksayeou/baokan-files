    The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Sanruili Village Branch Actively Strengthens Ideological Leadership Over the Production Increase Movement

    To the Editor: The party members in Sanruili Village, Xinghe County, Suiyuan Province, originally had serious "revolution success" thinking and were not enthusiastic about the patriotic production increase movement. After education, the party members participated in mutual aid teams at the beginning of summer plowing, and five party members even became mutual aid team leaders. Moreover, they were able to frequently promote the benefits of mutual aid teams to individual farmers and encourage individual farmers to join mutual aid teams. The three members of the branch committee each took charge of four to five mutual aid teams, regularly went to the mutual aid teams to understand the situation, and convened meetings of mutual aid team leaders to exchange experiences and solve problems. For example, due to the imperfect system of equal value exchange, disunity occurred in the mutual aid teams of Zhang Longzi and Guo Fengnian. Branch committee member Fan Laicheng promptly helped these two teams hold meetings and established an equal work system. Now these two mutual aid teams are very united. In addition, the branch also frequently conducts political education for farmers and strengthens the work of reading groups and people's schools. Now the political awareness of the peasants in the whole village has been generally improved, the number of people organized has been increasing day by day, and the patriotic production increase movement has been rapidly launched. All 2,730 mu of cultivated land in the village had been plowed for the first time before July, and 64 percent of it had been plowed twice.

    中共三瑞里村支部积极加强对增产运动的思想领导
    编辑同志：绥远省兴和县三瑞里村的党员，原来都存在着严重的“革命成功”思想，对于爱国增产运动不起劲。经过教育后，党员们在夏锄开始时，都参加了互助组，有五个党员还当了互助组长。而且他们能够经常地向单干户宣传互助组的好处，鼓励单干户参加互助组。支部的三个委员，又每人包干四个至五个互助组，定期到各互助组去了解情况，召集互助组长开会，交流经验，解决问题。如张龙子、郭丰年两个互助组因为等价交换制度不健全，发生了不团结的现象。支部委员范来成就及时地帮助这两个组开会，订出了等价齐工制度，现在这两个互助组团结得很好。此外，支部还对农民经常进行政治教育，并加强了读报组和民校等工作。现在全村农民的政治觉悟普遍提高了，组织起来的人数日渐增加，爱国增产运动迅速展开。全村两千七百三十亩耕地已在七月以前锄了头遍，其中有百分之六十四已锄过两遍。
