    Suiyuan Provincial Public Security Department's Reply Regarding the Handling of the Zhang Shunyou Incident by the Guihua City Public Security Bureau

    To the Editor: After the People's Daily published a letter to the editor on June 14th from Wang Shangzhi of the Yanggao County People's Court in Chahar Province, titled "Certain Cadres of the Guihua City Public Security Bureau Must Strictly Examine the Responsibility They Should Bear for the Zhang Shunyou Incident," we immediately conducted an investigation into the bureau's work style. The results of the investigation indicated that the situation described by Wang Shangzhi was basically correct.

    Prior to June 1st, the bureau had convened two cadre meetings to examine the Zhang Shunyou incident, but because some cadres mistakenly believed that the matter was "not closely related" to them and that the incident had already been resolved, they did not pay attention to it. On June 1st, when Wang Shangzhi and Zhang Ziying went to the bureau to inquire about Zhang Shunyou's salary, Cui Zhi, the bureau's secretary chief, only instructed Zheng Furong, a cadre of the bureau's Fourth Section, to have Deputy Section Chief Yu meet with them. Afterward, Cui Zhi did not check on the details of the meeting. It was only after the People's Daily published Wang Shangzhi's letter to the editor that the relevant cadres of the bureau paid attention.

    From the examination of this incident, it can be seen that the bureau's leadership has a bureaucratic work style and that some of its systems are unsound; it also shows that their political acumen is not sharp enough, and that their understanding of the essence of the Zhang Shunyou incident was insufficient, so they did not promptly learn from the lessons, improve their work, and establish and improve their systems.

    After June 1st, all cadres of the bureau spent two hours each day studying and examining the Zhang Shunyou incident. In particular, after the People's Daily published Wang Shangzhi's letter to the editor on June 14th, it further promoted the bureau's anti-bureaucracy struggle. The bureau has now achieved results in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. The bureau and the personnel involved in this incident, in addition to receiving strict criticism, have all made self-criticisms.

### 绥远省公安厅关于归绥市公安局对待张顺有事件的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    绥远省公安厅关于归绥市公安局对待张顺有事件的答复
    编辑同志：六月十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了察哈尔阳高县人民法院王尚智的“归绥市公安局某些干部必须严格检讨对张顺有事件应负的责任”的批评信后，我们即对该局的作风进行了检查。检查结果说明，王尚智所指出的情况，基本上是正确的。
    六月一日以前，该局虽然因张顺有事件召开过两次干部大会，进行了检查，但由于某些干部错误地认为此事与他们“关系不大”，并且这一事件已经得到解决，就不注意了。六月一日，王尚智、张子英到该局了解关于张顺有的工资问题时，该局秘书主任崔志只指示该局第四科干部郑富荣：让于副科长接见。事后崔志对于接见情况也没有进行检查。人民日报登载王尚智的批评信后，才引起了该局有关干部的注意。
    从这一事件的检查中，可以看出该局的领导方面是有着官僚主义作风的，某些制度也是不健全的；同时也表现了他们的政治嗅觉不够锐敏，他们对张顺有事件的本质认识不够，因此没有及时地接受教训，改进工作，建立和健全制度。
    六月一日以后，该局的全体干部每天拿两个钟头的时间进行关于张顺有事件的学习和检查。特别是六月十四日人民日报发表了王尚智的批评信以后，更进一步推动了该局的反官僚主义斗争。现在该局在反官僚主义斗争中已获得成绩。该局和这一事件有关的人员，除已受到严格的批评外，又都作了检讨。
