The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, after discussing the budget for the expenses and the method of collecting funds, as well as the estimated start-up costs and the method of sharing them, proposed by the preparatory office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and after revisions and additions, made the following resolutions:

I. Budget for Expenses and Method of Collection for the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

	1. The conference approved the budget for the expenses of the Preparatory Committee. However, due to the initial establishment of the organization, a lack of experience in personnel allocation and cost distribution, and to be realistic and more in line with the specific situation, the Representative Conference authorized the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee to make necessary flexible use under the principle of streamlining and saving.

	2. The conference decided on the following method for collecting expenses:

	(1) The Federations of Industry and Commerce or their preparatory committees in municipalities directly under the Central Government and cities under the jurisdiction of major administrative regions shall pay 5% of their monthly budget to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

	(2) The Federations of Industry and Commerce and their preparatory committees in cities, counties, and towns under the jurisdiction of provinces, and the Federations of Industry and Commerce at the same level, shall pay 2% of their monthly budget to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, as they also need to bear the expenses of the provincial or administrative region Federations of Industry and Commerce.

	(3) The 5% and 2% mentioned in the above two items shall be calculated based on the expenditure budget of each Federation of Industry and Commerce itself. If a Federation of Industry and Commerce has implemented unified collection and expenditure of membership fees for its affiliated trade associations, and the expenditure of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and its affiliated trade associations is not differentiated in the budget, the expenses to be paid to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce shall be determined through consultation.

	(4) The commission method shall be implemented on a trial basis from July 1952. All Federations of Industry and Commerce across the country shall start paying from July onwards. The procedures for payment are authorized to be decided and implemented by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee.

	(5) The method for state-owned enterprise head offices and cooperative headquarters to pay fees to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is authorized to be handled through consultation by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee.

	(6) The method for provincial or administrative region Federations of Industry and Commerce to collect membership fees shall be studied separately by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee.

	3. The conference agreed that the budget for the expenses of the Preparatory Committee should be from July 1952 to the end of June 1953 as a fiscal year. Before the new budget is approved at the end of the fiscal year, the Preparatory Committee may continue to implement the original budget and collection method. However, within this fiscal year, if the unified collection and expenditure of membership fees for affiliated trade associations has been basically completed by local Federations of Industry and Commerce, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee may reduce the percentage of collection based on the unified collection amount.

II. Estimated Start-up Costs and Method of Sharing for the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

	1. The conference agreed to authorize the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee to purchase or construct appropriate meeting places and necessary equipment.

	2. The conference agreed and expressed gratitude to the head offices of state-owned enterprises and cooperative headquarters for bearing half of the start-up costs of the Preparatory Committee; the remaining half shall be borne by private industry and commerce and joint state-private industry and commerce throughout the country.

	3. The conference decided on the following method for sharing start-up costs:

	(1) The Federations of Industry and Commerce and their preparatory committees in municipalities directly under the Central Government, cities under the jurisdiction of major administrative regions, cities under the jurisdiction of provinces, counties, and towns, and Federations of Industry and Commerce at the same level, shall all use one-thousandth of the declared turnover in October 1952 of private industrial and commercial households and joint state-private industrial and commercial households (excluding those with fixed tax amounts) within their respective regions as the standard for sharing the start-up costs of the Preparatory Committee. In special circumstances, the local Federation of Industry and Commerce or preparatory committee may negotiate a different method of sharing with the various industrial and commercial households, but should obtain the consent of the Preparatory Committee.

	(2) The above-mentioned start-up costs to be shared shall be remitted to the Preparatory Committee successively after November 15th and before December 31st of this year. The remittance procedures are authorized to be decided and implemented by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee.

	4. The conference decided that if there is a surplus in the start-up costs paid by local Federations of Industry and Commerce to the Preparatory Committee, it should be transferred to a fund. The method for managing and disbursing the fund is authorized to be decided by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee.

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议讨论了中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处所提出的中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会经费预算及经费征收办法、开办费概算及分担办法后，经过了修正和补充，作出决议如下：
    一、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会经费预算及征收办法
    1．会议同意筹备委员会的经费预算。但因机构初创，人员配备与费用分配，缺乏经验，为实事求是，更符合于具体情况起见，代表会议授权筹备委员会主任委员、副主任委员，在精简节约的原则下，可以作必要的机动运用。
    2．会议决定经费征收办法为：
    （一）中央直辖市及各大行政区辖市工商业联合会或其筹备会，每月均以其经费预算的百分之五，缴解中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会。
    （二）省辖市、县、镇工商业联合会及同级之工商业联合会或其筹备会，因尚须负担省或行署区工商业联合会的经费，故每月均以其经费预算的百分之二，缴解中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会。
    （三）上两项所指百分之五及百分之二，均以各工商业联合会本身之支出预算为计算标准；各工商业联合会对于所属各同业公会会费已实行统收统支，而在预算上对工商业联合会与所属各同业公会之支出未加划分者，其应缴解中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会的经费，以协商决定之。
    （四）提成办法，自一九五二年七月份起试行，所有全国各地工商业联合会均应于七月份起开始缴解；其缴解手续，授权筹备委员会主任委员、副主任委员决定施行。
    （五）国营企业总机构及合作总社，对于中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会之缴费办法，授权筹备委员会主任委员、副主任委员协商办理。
    （六）省或行署区工商业联合会征收会费办法，由筹备委员会常务委员会另行研究。
    3．会议同意筹备委员会之经费预算，以一九五二年七月份起，至一九五三年六月底止为一会计年度。会计年度届满，新预算尚未通过前，筹备委员会得照原经费预算及原征收办法继续施行；但在本会计年度内，各地工商业联合会对所属各同业公会会费，如基本上已完成统收统支，筹备委员会常务委员会得就统收数额减低百分率征收之。
    二、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会开办费概算及分担办法
    1．会议同意授权筹备委员会主任委员、副主任委员购置或建筑认为适当之会所及其必要之设备。
    2．会议同意并感谢国营企业总机构及合作总社担任筹备委员会开办费之半数；其余半数由全国私营工商业及公私合营工商业分担。
    3．会议决定开办费分担办法为：
    （一）中央直辖市、大行政区辖市、省辖市、县镇工商业联合会及同级之工商业联合会或其筹备会，各就其区域内之私营工商业户、公私合营工商业户（除定期定额税户外）一律比照一九五二年十月份之自报营业额的千分之一为分担筹备委员会开办费之标准。如有特殊情况时，该地工商业联合会或筹备会，得与各工商业户另行协商分担办法，但应征得筹备委员会之同意。
    （二）上项分担之开办费，均应于本年十一月十五日以后，十二月三十一日以前，陆续汇缴筹备委员会，汇缴手续，授权筹备委员会主任委员、副主任委员决定施行。
    4、会议决定筹备委员会所收各地工商业联合会缴解之开办费，如支付有余时，应移作基金，基金之保管及动支办法，授权筹备委员会常务委员会决定之。
