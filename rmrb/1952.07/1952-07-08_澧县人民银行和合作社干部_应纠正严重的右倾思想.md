    The People's Bank of Lixian County and Cooperative Cadres
    Should Correct Their Serious Right-Leaning Ideologies

    To the Editor: The People's Bank of Lixian County, Hunan Province, and the county's cooperative have serious right-leaning ideologies in their business operations. The bank, when providing loans in rural areas, regards middle peasants and rich peasants as the main targets for loans, and rarely lends to poor and landless peasants. The county's cooperative also exhibited a similar phenomenon in its work of lending fertilizer and pre-purchasing cotton. In Gaomiao Township, District Five, a rich peasant not only obtained a loan from the bank but also received a deposit from the cooperative for pre-selling cotton. He used all these funds to buy grain, which is more than enough for his entire family to eat until the autumn harvest. However, in District Eight, a poor peasant neither obtained a loan nor pre-sold cotton during the spring famine, and his life was extremely difficult. After harvesting barley in April, he was eager to sell it, but the cooperative refused to buy it. He had no choice but to sell it to a distillery owner at a price of 10,000 yuan per shih (while the market price was 28,000 yuan). Why do the bank and the cooperative not take care of the basic masses? The reason is that they are afraid that the loans to poor and landless peasants will not be recovered, and it is easier to recover loans from middle peasants and rich peasants. I believe this thinking is extremely wrong, and I hope relevant departments will conduct an inspection and quickly correct this phenomenon.

### 澧县人民银行和合作社干部  应纠正严重的右倾思想

    澧县人民银行和合作社干部
    应纠正严重的右倾思想
    编辑同志：湖南澧县人民银行和县合作社，在业务工作中有严重的右倾思想。银行在农村中贷款，把中农和富农作为主要贷款对象，很少贷给贫雇农。县合作社在贷肥料和预购棉花的工作中，也表现了类似现象。五区高庙乡有一个富农，既从银行贷到了款子，又在合作社取得预卖棉花的定金。他把这些款子全部买了谷子，这些谷子可供他全家吃到秋收还有余。而八区有一个贫农，在春荒时期既没有贷到款，也没有预卖棉花，生活极端困难。四月份他收割大麦以后，就急着要出卖，但合作社不收购。他没有办法，只好按每石大麦一万元的价格卖给酒坊老板（当时市价为二万八千元）。银行、合作社为什么不照顾基本群众呢？原来他们是怕把款贷给贫雇农以后收不回来，不如贷给中农和富农容易收。我认为这种思想是极其错误的，希望有关部门进行检查，迅速纠正这种现象。    谭颖喜
