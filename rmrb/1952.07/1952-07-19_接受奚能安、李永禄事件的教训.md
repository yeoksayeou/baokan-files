Brief Commentary on Party Life:

Accepting the Lessons of the Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu Incident

The Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu incident, in which they used deceptive means to fraudulently obtain the title of meritorious workers, is a major event in the People's Railway system.

From 1949 onwards, Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu had been systematically fabricating achievements and concealing accidents. The fact that such a serious problem was not discovered until the "Three-Anti" movement shows the extent of the bureaucracy within the relevant Party committees. The reason they committed such serious bureaucratic errors was not only because they were aloof, relying solely on reports without conducting in-depth inspections, but also because they had a mentality of being fond of greatness and eager for success. As soon as they heard that a model figure had emerged in the unit they led, they were content, never considering the authenticity of the model figure or studying the actual impact of the model figure on the masses. Therefore, after seeing the set of false records fabricated by Xi Neng'an, they believed it to be true and abandoned the supervisory role of the Party committee in the important task of cultivating models. In this way, they treated swindlers as meritorious workers. However, the seriousness of the problem does not stop there. They had heard the opinions of the workers about Xi Neng'an and saw the flaws in the so-called "Model Locomotive" No. 1939. At this time, they had the opportunity to correct their mistakes, but they lightly let go of this opportunity. Therefore, under the erroneous idea of so-called "taking care of typical cases," they adopted an unprincipled attitude of accommodating the errors of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu. Originally, the examination results of Locomotive No. 1939's crew were not sufficient, but they were specially approved as backbone members of the model locomotive team. In this way, the scam of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu was not quickly exposed, relying on the special care of the leadership. It is clear that the relevant leadership of Locomotive No. 1939's crew did not work according to the principle of seeking truth from facts but worked with a bureaucratic attitude. This is an important reason why they made mistakes and Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu were able to exploit loopholes.

The occurrence of the Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu incident also shows that if people with bad consciousness are allowed to develop their erroneous thoughts, they will degenerate and degenerate, unable to extricate themselves, and eventually completely oppose the Party and the working class. Regarding this point, the behavior of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu and their expulsion from the Party have provided the best explanation. Originally, cultivating heroic model figures and giving play to the bridge, backbone, and leading role of heroic model figures to promote the accelerated advancement of the people's revolutionary cause is one of the basic leadership methods of our Party. In the various movements led by our Party, a large number of well-deserved heroic model figures have indeed emerged. The reason why these heroic models are respected is because of their loyalty to the people's revolutionary cause and because of their valuable contributions to the people's revolutionary cause. Some people do not understand and learn from heroic model figures from this perspective, but instead use a personalistic attitude, using bad means, exaggerating or even fabricating achievements, swindling and deceiving to satisfy personal desires. From the shameful acts of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu, we have already seen a typical example of such people. Therefore, all those who still have this bad thinking should seriously accept the lessons of the Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu incident, strictly temper themselves, eradicate their old consciousness, and strive to be a good Party member.

### 接受奚能安、李永禄事件的教训

    接受奚能安、李永禄事件的教训
    奚能安和李永禄采用欺骗手段、骗取功臣称号的事件，是人民铁路系统中的重大事件。
    从一九四九年起，奚能安和李永禄一直在有计划地捏造成绩，隐瞒事故，而这样严重的问题竟然会迟至“三反”运动中才被发觉，这说明有关党委的官僚主义作风，已经严重到了什么样的程度。他们之所以犯了这样严重的官僚主义错误，不仅因为他们高高在上，只凭信报告，而不进行深入检查；而且因为他们有着好大喜功的心理，只要听说自己领导的单位出现了模范人物，就心满意足，根本不去考虑模范人物的真假，不去研究模范人物在群众中的影响究竟如何。所以他们看了奚能安捏造的
    一套假纪录，也就信以为真，放弃了党委在培养模范这一重要工作中的监督作用。这样，他们就把骗子当作了功臣。但是，问题的严重性还不止此。他们是曾经听到工人群众对奚能安的意见的，也看出了一九三九号这个所谓“模范机车”的破绽，这时，他们本来有机会纠正自己的错误；但是，他们把这一机会轻轻放过。因此，在所谓“照顾典型”的错误思想下面，他们对奚能安、李永禄的错误，采取了无原则的迁就态度。本来，一九三九号机车包乘组考试结果，不够分数，却被特准为模范机车队的基干队员。这样，奚能安和李永禄的骗局，就依靠领导方面的特殊照顾，没有被很快揭穿。事情很清楚，一九三九号机车包乘组的有关领导方面，并没有按照实事求是的原则去进行工作，而是以官僚主义的态度进行工作。这就是他们所以犯错误，奚能安和李永禄所以能够钻空子的重要原因。
    奚能安、李永禄事件的发生，也说明存在着恶劣意识的人，如果听任其错误思想发展，那末他们就要堕落蜕化，不能自拔，以致最后同党和工人阶级完全对立起来。关于这一层，奚能安和李永禄的行为以及他们被开除出党的下场，已经作了最好的说明。本来，培养英雄模范人物，发挥英雄模范人物的桥梁、骨干和带头作用，以推动人民革命事业加速前进，是我们党的基本领导方法之一。在我们党所领导的各种运动中，也确实涌现了大批的名符其实的英雄模范人物。这些英雄模范所以受人尊敬，是因为他们对人民革命事业的忠诚态度，是因为他们对人民革命事业的可贵贡献。有些人不从这一方面去了解和学习英雄模范人物，而是用个人主义的态度，用恶劣的手段，夸大甚至捏造成绩，招摇撞骗，以满足个人的私欲。从奚能安和李永禄的可耻行径中，我们已经看到了这种人的典型。因此，凡是还存在着这种恶劣思想的人，都应该认真接受奚能安、李永禄事件的教训，严格地锻炼自己，根除自己的旧意识，努力作一个好的党员。
