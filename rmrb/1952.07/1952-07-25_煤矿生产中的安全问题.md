    Safety Issues in Coal Mine Production
    Tong Lang

    In the past three years, under the policy of safe production and through the efforts of the broad masses of workers, the national coal mining industry has significantly reduced casualties. Taking 1951 as an example, the number of casualties in state-owned coal mines nationwide decreased by 64% compared to 1949. This shows that safety work has been successful. However, due to various reasons, the foundation of safety work is still not solid, and casualties cannot be completely eradicated. Since the "Three-Anti" movement this year, some units in some regions have not integrated production well with the movement, and accidents have instead increased. This serious situation must be changed.

    Even under the current technical conditions, accidents are completely avoidable and can be eliminated. The downward trend in accidents over the past three years fully demonstrates this. So why haven't accidents been eliminated yet, and why have they even increased in recent months? The most important reason is that there are still many shortcomings in the leadership and management methods of the mines. According to the analysis of the causes of major accidents in national state-owned coal mines in 1951 by the Ministry of Fuel Industry, accidents caused by violations of safety regulations, safety systems, and labor discipline accounted for 50%; accidents caused by lack of inspection or incomplete inspection accounted for more than 25%. In other words, most accidents are caused by a lack of production discipline and bureaucratic leadership.

    Why do these phenomena occur? Is it that leaders and cadres at all levels in our coal mining enterprises are not responsible for the safety and health of workers? Generally speaking, most mine leaders and cadres understand the policy of safe production and are responsible for the safety and health of workers. However, some comrades often neglect safety issues due to one-sided or isolated considerations of how to complete production tasks and how to reduce costs. For example, during the "Three-Anti" movement, the masses reflected on certain bureau chiefs: "They only care about three figures: production figures, efficiency figures, and cost figures." Another example is Yangquan No. 4 Mine in the North China region. After an accident occurred, workers reflected: "Since September last year, the mine has only emphasized tasks, only caring about costs and not about workers." The more directly involved a cadre is in leading production, the more likely this purely task-oriented view is to be expressed. For example, a major roof fall accident occurred last year in the Fuxin Mining Bureau in the Northeast region because the shift foreman insisted on blasting to produce more coal, even though blasting should not have been done at that time according to the cycle chart. Workers requested a halt three times, but the foreman did not listen, leading to the roof fall. This viewpoint becomes even more prominent when there is a conflict between safety and production. For example, Yangquan No. 4 Mine is a super gassy mine, but in order to reduce costs, the mine did not hesitate to violate safety regulations and use black powder.

    Cadres with a purely task-oriented view cannot effectively implement safety regulations. Some engineering and technical cadres blindly emphasize poor technical conditions and insufficient investment, believing that safety regulations cannot be implemented; some management cadres believe that "you are using regulations to limit my production" and are unwilling to implement safety regulations; some cadres directly leading production even hold a resistant attitude. For example, a certain mining area of Datong Mine in Huainan had no return air path. The inspector pointed out that this was a violation of safety regulations and suggested stopping work, but the district chief said: "How can we complete the task if we stop production? I don't understand safety regulations, and I don't have time to look at them. You can report to the higher authorities." Another example is the Hanqiao Well in Jiawang. Workers in the well were sitting on powder kegs smoking while inserting detonating cords into detonators. The inspector stopped him, but the well chief told the inspector not to make random suggestions. The inspector showed him the words "No Smoking," and he said: "I can't read, don't come at me with that!" How can cadres with this attitude educate and urge workers to implement safety regulations? They can only hinder the implementation of safety regulations.

    Some cadres in coal mines also harbor a kind of侥幸 (jiǎoxìng - fluke) mentality. Because they sometimes see people smoking while sitting on powder kegs without an explosion occurring by chance; sometimes they see signs of water without drilling to explore for water, and they get by safely by chance; sometimes even if they produce recklessly, accidents are avoided by chance. As a result, they become complacent about accidents. Obviously, this mentality is extremely harmful. For example, on April 11th this year, the Fuguo No. 3 Pit of the Xi'an Mining Bureau in the Northeast region detected the smell of gasoline underground (a sign of spontaneous combustion), and the gas concentration had reached more than 5%. However, the mine manager insisted that it was "not a big deal," and the bureau chief believed that "if you want to do it, do it quickly." It was clear that there was a risk of explosion, but they still took the risk of producing until an accident occurred. This is a serious lesson.

    At present, the country is launching a large-scale production increase and conservation movement. When the enthusiasm of the masses for production is high, when the masses are dedicating themselves to production competitions, safety work becomes even more important. Leading cadres of coal mining enterprises at all levels must pay close attention to the safety and health of workers, and conscientiously implement the policy of safe production in terms of ideology, organization, regulations, production plans, technical improvements, and daily work. Leading cadres of coal mines should first thoroughly criticize the purely task-oriented viewpoint and other erroneous ideas and mentalities that ignore safety. They should recognize that regulations are the scientific summary of the experiences and lessons of the broad masses of workers in production, and that implementing regulations is a matter of implementing the production discipline of the people's mines. All management cadres and technical cadres must be familiar with coal mine safety regulations and various safety systems, and in particular, they should focus on cadres who directly lead production, so that they conscientiously implement regulations and strengthen the education of workers on regulations. Make a plan for the implementation of regulations, and implement it into actual work through cadres who directly lead production.

    Coal mine safety inspection organizations are new organizations in the people's mines and an important link in safety work, but they are the weakest link at the present stage. Therefore, this organization must be strengthened, leadership over safety inspection organizations must be strengthened, their work must be supervised and improved at any time, safety work inspections must be carried out regularly and in depth, and problems existing in safety work must be discovered in a timely manner in daily work, and solved in terms of technical operations, engineering equipment, and ideological education.

    In order to successfully complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and in order to lay the foundation for large-scale economic construction, leading comrades of mines must pay hundreds of times more attention to safe production.

    煤矿生产中的安全问题
    佟浪
    全国煤矿工业三年来在安全生产的方针下，经过广大职工的努力，伤亡事故已有显著减少。以一九五一年为例，全国国营煤矿伤亡人数，已比一九四九年减少百分之六十四。这说明安全工作是有成绩的。但是，由于种种原因，安全工作基础还是不稳固的，还不能完全根除伤亡事故。今年“三反”运动以来，有些地区的某些单位，生产与运动结合得不好，事故反而增加了。这一严重情况必须有所改变。
    即使是在现在的技术条件下，事故也是完全可以避免的，可以消灭的。三年来事故趋势的逐年下降，充分地说明了这一点。那么为什么到现在事故还没有消灭，甚至最近几月反而增加了呢？最重要的原因，就是矿山的领导和管理方法还有不少缺点。根据燃料工业部一九五一年全国国营煤矿重大事故的原因分析，由于违犯保安规程、保安制度和违犯劳动纪律而引起的事故占百分之五十；由于缺乏检查或检查不彻底而引起的事故占百分之二十五以上。也就是说，大部分事故是由于缺乏生产纪律性和领导上的官僚主义所致。
    为什么会有以上的现象？是不是我们煤矿企业中的各级领导干部对工人的生命安全和健康不负责任呢？一般说来，大多数的矿山领导干部，是了解安全生产的政策的，对工人生命安全和健康是负责任的。但是也有一些同志，常常由于片面的或孤立的考虑如何完成生产任务，如何降低成本，而忽视了安全的问题。如在“三反”运动中，群众对某些局长的反映是：“只要三个数字：一是生产数字，一是效率数字，一是成本数字”。又如华北区阳泉四矿在发生事故后，工人反映：“自去年九月以来，只强调任务，矿上只要成本，不要工人”。这种单纯任务观点，愈是直接领导生产的干部，愈是容易表现出来。如东北区阜新矿务局去年发生的一次大冒顶事故，原因即是本来按照循环图表当时不应放炮，而班长为了多出煤，坚持放炮，工人三次要求停止，班长不听，始致冒顶。当着安全与生产有矛盾时候，这种观点就更显著了。如阳泉四矿本是超级瓦斯矿，但该矿为了减低成本，却不惜违犯保安规程，使用黑色火药。
    抱着单纯任务观点的干部，就不可能切实贯彻实行保安规程。有些工程技术干部盲目地强调技术条件差，强调投资不足，认为不能实行保安规程；有的管理干部认为“你拿规程来限制我生产”，而不愿实行保安规程；有些直接领导生产的干部甚至持着抵抗的情绪，如淮南大通矿某回采区无回风路，检查员提出这是违犯保安规程的，建议停止工作，该区区长却说：“停产如何能完成任务？我不懂保安规程，我也没工夫看，你往上级反映好了。”又如贾汪韩桥井，井下工人坐在炮药箱上一边吸烟，一边用药线插入雷管，检查员制止他，井长反而叫检查员不要乱提意见，检查员让他看“禁止烟火”的字样，他说：“我不识字，不用和我来这一套！”试问，持着这种情绪的干部，如何能教育工人，督促工人来贯彻保安规程呢？他只能阻碍保安规程的贯彻。
    煤矿的某些干部中也还存着另外一种侥幸心理。由于他们有时看到坐在炮药箱上吸烟，侥幸并未发生爆炸；有时看到有出水的象征，没有打钻探水，侥幸也安然过去了；有时即是冒险生产，事故也能幸免。由此，便造成了对事故的麻痹心理。显然的，这种心理是极端有害的。例如东北区西安矿务局富国三坑，在今年四月十一日发现井下有汽油味
    （自然发火象征），瓦斯已达百分之五以上，而矿长始终认为是“不要紧”，局长则认为“要干就快干”，分明情况已有爆炸的危险了，还要冒险生产，直至造成事故。这是一个严重的教训。
    目前，全国正展开大规模的增产节约运动，当群众生产情绪高涨的时候，当群众奋不顾身地投入生产竞赛的时候，安全工作就更显得重要。各级煤矿企业的领导干部，必须密切注意工人的安全与健康，从思想上、组织上、规程制度上、生产计划上、技术改进上和日常工作中来切实贯彻安全生产的方针。煤矿的领导干部应首先彻底批判单纯任务观点以及其他忽视安全的错误思想和心理，应该认识到规程制度就是广大职工在生产中的经验与教训的科学的总结，执行规程制度，即是执行人民矿山生产纪律的问题。所有管理干部、技术干部，都必须熟悉煤矿保安规程及各种保安制度，特别应抓紧直接领导生产的干部，使他们认真执行规程制度，并对工人加强规程制度的教育。作出规程的执行计划，通过直接领导生产干部来贯彻到实际工作中去。
    煤矿安全检查组织，是人民矿山的新的组织，是安全工作重要的环节，但在现阶段是最弱的环节。因此，必须充实这一机构，加强对于安全检查组织的领导，随时督促和改进他们的工作，经常而深入地进行安全工作的检查，在日常工作中及时发现问题，及时从技术操作方面、工程设备方面、思想教育方面来解决安全工作中存在的问题。
    为了胜利地完成增产节约任务，为了奠定大规模经济建设的基础，矿山的领导同志，必须千百倍地注意安全生产。
