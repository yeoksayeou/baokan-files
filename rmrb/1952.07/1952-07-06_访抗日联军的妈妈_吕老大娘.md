Visiting the Mother of the Anti-Japanese United Army – Grandma Lü
By Zhang Lin, Representative of the Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army

In the movie "Zhao Yiman," we cannot forget the old women and old men who sheltered Comrade Zhao Yiman and fought heroically against the Japanese imperialists with her. During this return visit, we were thrilled to meet two such heroic old women and old men in Yimianpo, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, the old base area of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Even on the train, we were enthusiastically discussing the heroic deeds of the two elders: Grandma Lü is fifty-three years old this year. She participated in the armed anti-Japanese struggle since the Japanese devils occupied Northeast China, engaging in underground activities in the Daqingchuan area. Soon, she was introduced to the Communist Party of China by a Comrade Che (Korean) who worked with her. Later, she served as the party branch secretary in the Xiaoliangzhuhe District of Shangzhi County. She organized the women's federation in eighteen guerrilla areas, serving as the president herself. She actively educated women to participate in anti-Japanese activities, doing work such as collecting intelligence. Despite the enemy's strict blockade, frantic burning, killing, and destruction, she persisted in the struggle for three years. In 1934, she became the district chief of the area.

In 1935, during a ruthless enemy sweep, the Anti-Japanese United Army suffered some losses, and she was unfortunately captured by the enemy. The enemy subjected her to severe torture and repeated interrogation, but Grandma Lü never yielded to the enemy, fighting them for seventy-five days. The enemy exhausted all kinds of cruel methods, but could not obtain any confession, so they had to release her. After being released from prison, Grandma Lü immediately returned to participate in the anti-Japanese work, and in the same year was sent to the Shenyang area to work with Comrade Yang Jingyu (Commander of the First Route Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army). A year later, she separated from Comrade Yang Jingyu due to another enemy sweep. From then on, she lost contact with the Party. Although repeated investigations and searches were conducted, the connection could not be re-established due to the harsh environment. After that, she conducted independent activities in the Xiaoliangzhuhe District. In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to liberate Northeast China. Grandma Lü became active again, organizing anti-Japanese armed forces to cooperate with the Red Army in combat, once killing two Japanese devils. Soon after the Red Army returned to the country, the "Central Beards" (蒋系土匪, Jiang-faction bandits masquerading as anti-communists) came and disarmed her. But she still lived in Yimianpo, continuing her revolutionary activities.

When we talked about how Grandma Lü sheltered Comrade Zhao Yiman's anti-Japanese activities, and how Grandpa Lü risked going into the mountains to deliver food to the Anti-Japanese United Army, the scene from the movie "Zhao Yiman" of Grandpa Lü using carts and sleds to cross snowy mountains, traverse forests, and deceive many enemy blockades to deliver food to the Anti-Japanese United Army, came to our minds again. "We're about to see him!" The comrades jumped up with joy.

After the train passed through a vast plain and entered a rolling mountainous area, a comrade introduced us: "This is the old base area of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and ahead is 'Yimianpo'."

After getting off the train, we met these two old warriors of the Anti-Japanese United Army in the crowd. After presenting them with flowers, we were so happy that we didn't know what to do. In their home, Grandma Lü treated us like her long-lost children. Holding a teapot, she said to us:

"Children, I knew you would come to see me, so I specially prepared good tea for you." She first inquired about Commander Peng's health, and asked about the living conditions of the comrades at the front, and then introduced to us her experience of attending the meeting in Beijing. She said: She saw Chairman Mao, and also saw Liu Hulan's mother. She pointed to the photo in the frame on the wall and said, "This is a group photo of me, Comrade Deng Yingchao, and Liu Hulan's mother."

Grandpa Lü told us: His two children had gloriously sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan. An adopted son joined the Volunteer Army last year to resist America, aid Korea, protect his home, and defend the country.

When we mentioned Comrade Zhao Yiman, Grandma Lü said sadly: "Alas! That 'Skinny Li' (Zhao Yiman's pseudonym at the time, because her surname was Li and she was tall and thin, so everyone called her Skinny Li) that child, I will never forget her in my life. She used to live in my house, and the Japanese devils sent people to arrest her several times, but I rescued her every time. She reasoned with me, and worked so actively. She was only twenty-seven years old when she died, what a pity! If she were still alive now, and could see our victory today, I don't know how happy she would be!" On the wall of Grandma Lü's house, hung one banner after another, which were given to her by the volunteer wounded and sick soldiers who returned to the country for recuperation. This nationally renowned mother of the Anti-Japanese United Army is now a good mother to our Volunteer Army. She actively participated in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, publicizing it everywhere. She cares for the volunteer wounded and sick soldiers returning from Korea for recuperation like she cares for her own children. She often leads women to wash clothes for the wounded, and personally visits them in the ward, covering them with quilts, stroking their hair, and telling them to rest assured and recuperate. Last year, she bought more than six hundred catties of melon seeds at once with the money she saved by being frugal and distributed them to the recuperating soldiers to eat. During the New Year, she also sent 8 million yuan in consolation money and fifty consolation letters.

The recuperating soldiers living nearby love Grandma Lü like their own mother. Everyone likes to go to her house to see her. During the New Year, everyone pooled money to buy a bag of flour, fifty catties of pork, and some apples and snacks to send to her. People who went to her house to pay New Year's greetings filled the house for several days in a row.

Before leaving, Grandma Lü told us: "I am very grateful to you for bravely fighting the American devils in Korea. Without you young people, the people of our motherland would not be able to live such a good life! You must remember my words, go back and tell the comrades to fight the American devils hard, and defend the peaceful life of our motherland."

Dear mother, don't worry, we will definitely strike the enemy hard, defend our motherland, and defend our glorious mother!

    访抗日联军的妈妈——吕老大娘
    中国人民志愿军归国代表    张琳
    在电影“赵一曼”里，我们忘不了那些掩护赵一曼同志，并和她一道英勇地打击日本帝国主义者的老大娘和老大爷们。这次归国访问时，我们以十分兴奋的心情，在东北抗日联军的老根据地松江省尚志县的一面坡，会见了两位这样英雄的老大娘和老大爷。还在火车上，我们就热烈谈论着两位老人的英雄事迹：吕老大娘今年五十三岁了。她自从日本鬼子侵占东北的时候起就参加了武装抗日斗争，在大青川一带作地下活动。不久，由一位和她一起工作的车同志（朝鲜人），介绍她加入了中国共产党。后来她曾经在尚志县的小亮珠河区任党的支部书记。她组织了十八个游击区的妇女会，自己兼任会长。她积极地教育妇女参加抗日活动，做收集情报等工作。在敌人的严密封锁、疯狂烧杀和破坏的情况下，坚持了三年斗争，一九三四年她担任了该区的区长。
    一九三五年，在敌人的残酷扫荡中，抗日联军受了
    一些损失，她不幸被敌人抓去了。敌人严刑拷打她，反复审讯她，吕老大娘始终未向敌人屈服，一直和敌人斗争了七十五天。敌人用尽了各种残酷办法，但始终得不到一点口供，只好将她释放出来。吕老大娘出狱以后，立刻又回去参加抗日工作，当年就被派到沈阳一带与杨靖宇同志（抗日联军第一路军的司令员）在一起活动。一年以后，又因为敌人扫荡，和杨靖宇同志分手了。从此以后，她失掉了党的关系。虽然经过再三的调查和寻找，终于因为环境恶劣，未能接上关系。之后，她即在小亮珠河区进行单独的活动。一九四五年八月，苏联出兵解放东北。吕老大娘又活跃起来，组织了抗日武装，配合红军作战，有一次打死了两个日本鬼子。不久红军回国，“中央胡子”（以反共为名的蒋系土匪）又来解除了她的武装。但是她仍住在一面坡，继续进行革命活动。
    当我们谈到吕老大娘怎样掩护赵一曼同志的抗日活动，以及吕老大爷怎样冒着危险到山里去给抗日联军送粮食的时候，“赵一曼”电影上那位吕老大爷用大车、爬犁，爬过雪山，穿过森林，骗过敌人许多封锁线，把粮食送到抗日联军的手里的情景又涌现在我的眼前。“这回马上就要看到他了！”同志们都高兴得跳起来。
    列车穿过了一片广大的平原，进入了起伏的山岭地区以后，有一位同志向我们介绍说：“这里就是东北抗日联军的老根据地，前面就是‘一面坡’。”
    下了火车，我们在人群里会见了这两位抗日联军的老战士，向他们献花以后，我们高兴得不知道怎样才好。在他们的家里，吕老大娘像对自己久别的儿女一样招待我们。她抱着一只茶壶，对我们说：
    “孩子，我知道你们准来看我，特意给你们预备了好茶叶。”她首先问候了彭司令员的健康，询问了前线同志们的生活情形以后，就向我们介绍她到北京开会的情形。她说：她看见了毛主席，又看见了刘胡兰的母亲。她指着墙上镜框里的照片说：“这是我和邓颖超同志还有刘胡兰母亲的合影。”
    吕老大爷告诉我们：他的两个孩子，都在抗日战争中光荣牺牲了。过继的一个儿子，为了抗美援朝保家卫国，去年又参加了志愿军。
    当我们提到赵一曼同志的时候，吕老大娘悲伤地说：“唉！‘瘦李子’（当时赵一曼的化名，因为姓李，又长又瘦，才都叫她瘦李子）那孩子，我一辈子也忘不了她。她曾经住在我家里，日本鬼子几次派人抓她，都被我救出来了。她在我这里讲道理给我听，工作那么积极，死的时候才二十七岁，多么可惜！到现在还活着的话，让她看看咱们今天的胜利，不知道她会怎么样高兴呢！”在吕老大娘家的墙上，挂着一面一面的锦旗，这是回国休养的志愿军伤病员献给她的。这位全国闻名的抗日联军的妈妈，现在是我们志愿军的好妈妈。她积极地参加了抗美援朝工作，到处宣传。她对从朝鲜回国休养的志愿军伤病员，像爱护自己的孩子一样关心。她时常领着妇女去给伤员洗衣服，并且亲自到病房去看望他们，给他们盖被子，抚摸着他们的头发，嘱咐他们安心休养。去年，她把省吃俭用攒下来的钱，一次买了六百多斤瓜子分给了休养员吃。过年的时候，她又送了八十万元的慰问金和五十封慰问信。
    住在附近的休养员，热爱吕老大娘像自己的母亲一样。大家都喜欢到她家里去看她。过年的时候，大家凑钱，买了一袋白面、五十斤猪肉和一些苹果点心等送给她。到她家去拜年的，一连几天都挤满了屋子。
    临别的时候，吕老大娘嘱咐我们：“你们在朝鲜勇敢地打美国鬼子，我心里非常感谢你们。没有你们这些年青人，咱们祖国人民就过不着这样的好日子！你们要记住我的话，回去好好告诉同志们狠狠地打美国鬼子，保卫咱们祖国的和平生活。”
    亲爱的妈妈，你放心吧，我们一定狠狠地打击敌人，保卫祖国、保卫光荣的妈妈！
