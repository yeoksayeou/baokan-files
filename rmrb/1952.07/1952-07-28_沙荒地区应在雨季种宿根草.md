    Sand Desert Areas Should Plant Perennial Grasses in the Rainy Season

    To the Editor: There are many sandy desert areas in Northwest, Northeast, and North China. These areas are "thousands of miles of barren land without a single blade of grass," and the wind and sand are extremely strong, seriously endangering the surrounding farmland. Since liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, the masses in various regions have organized themselves to plant trees cooperatively, turning some sandy desert areas into protective forest belts and windbreak forest networks. They have begun to play a role in preventing wind and fixing sand.

    To further fix shifting sand, improve the soil, and expand the area of cultivated land, planting perennial grasses in these sandy desert areas where forest networks have already been established during the rainy season is a very important method.

    Perennial grasses such as alfalfa, *Ma Shao* (Chinese Lespedeza), and *Kushen* (Sophora Flavescens) have extensive root systems with many root nodule bacteria, which play a significant role in fixing shifting sand and improving the soil. Alfalfa is a good livestock feed; when planted in sandy areas, it can be harvested twice a year, yielding approximately 1,500 *jin* per *mu*. The young branches and leaves of *Ma Shao* and *Kushen* can be used as green manure or bedding for manure accumulation. After they mature in the autumn, they can also be used as fuel.

    The most suitable time for sowing perennial grasses is during the rainy season, but in the early stages of the rainy season, there are often sudden strong winds and rainstorms, making perennial grass seeds susceptible to being washed away and silted, making it difficult to get a full stand. According to the years of experience of farmers in Donghuotong Village in Xingtang County and Gaoling Village in Wuji County, Hebei Province, and the results of experiments conducted by the Jixi Afforestation Experimental Farm over the past two years, it is most suitable to sow perennial grasses in early August. This is because the period of rainstorms has already passed, and the seedlings of perennial grasses can avoid the invasion of storms. Now is the best time to sow perennial grasses. I suggest that all sandy desert areas seize the time and quickly mobilize farmers to plant them.

### 沙荒地区应在雨季种宿根草

    沙荒地区应在雨季种宿根草
    编辑同志：我国西北、东北、华北各地，都有许多沙荒地带。这些地区“赤地千里，寸草不生”，风沙极大，严重地危害着周围的耕地。解放以后，各地群众在人民政府领导下，组织起来，互助造林，使某些沙荒地区，变成了防护林带和防风林网。它们已开始起了防风固沙的作用。
    为了进一步固定流沙，改良土壤，扩大耕地面积，在这些已经营造林网的沙荒地区，在雨季播种宿根草，是一个很重要的办法。
    苜蓿、马梢（铁扫帚）、苦参（野槐花）等宿根草，根系庞大，根部根瘤菌很多，这对固定流沙，改良土壤有很大作用。苜蓿是一种良好的牲畜饲料，在沙地种植，每年可收割二次，每亩约可收获一千五百斤。马梢、苦参的幼枝、嫩叶可作绿肥或垫圈攒粪，在秋季成熟后，还可作燃料用。
    宿根草最适宜的播种时期在雨季，但雨季初期，常有急风暴雨，宿根草的种籽易遭冲刷、淤沉，难出全苗。根据河北省行唐县东霍同村、无极县高陵村农民多年播种宿根草的经验，和冀西造林实验场两年来试验的结果，在八月上旬播种宿根草最为适宜。因为这暴雨时期已经过去，宿根草的幼苗可以免去暴风雨的侵袭。眼下正是播种宿根草的最好时候，我建议各沙荒地区抓紧时间，迅速发动农民进行种植。
