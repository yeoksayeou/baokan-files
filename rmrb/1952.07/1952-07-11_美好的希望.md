    Beautiful Hope
    By our reporter Bai Yuan
    One morning, at the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project site, a small steamer docked next to the Taipingkou pier was packed with people. This was the first ferry to Shashi from Taipingkou. Cooks from the construction site, supply and marketing staff from the cooperative, and small vendors doing business on the site were all taking the boat to Shashi to return to the site in the afternoon. They carried many baskets and bundles, making the small steamer incredibly crowded.
    "The sun is so high, why haven't we left yet!" An old lady in her sixties or seventies, squatting on a small bundle, shouted from among the crowded people.
    "Probably waiting for everyone to arrive, but the boat is almost overflowing," said an old man of about the same age as the old lady.
    "They should leave on schedule!" said the old lady.
    Actually, the scheduled time hadn't arrived yet, but the old lady was anxious.
    A fleet of sailboats transporting equipment to the construction site sailed from Taipingkou towards the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The sun, just rising from the river, scattered a golden light on the water. More people continued to board the ship. After the whistle sounded, the ship slowly began to move.
    At this time, a middle-aged woman who finally caught the boat, holding a baby of several months in her arms, squeezed next to the old lady and greeted her:
    "Auntie Peng, please find a place for the child, why is it so crowded?"
    "Just sit down here, why are you so late? Really... what star spirit's prince? Bringing him here from so far away, up and down."
    "It was his grandmother's good idea. When we were at home, I said, it's not like we're going out for ten days and a half, if we leave him at home, where can't he find a few meals of milk? But his grandmother insisted on bringing him, saying that it's something that hasn't happened for dozens or hundreds of generations, let the child see it too! She doesn't know how tiring it is!"
    This woman and Auntie Peng were from the same village, more than ten miles from Shashi. Her husband had discussed with his family before the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project started and built a small shed in Taipingkou to sell matches, towels, and soap from Shashi to the people on the construction site. After the project started, people who went from the construction site to the village spread the word, saying how great the project was, something that had never happened since the beginning of time. So everyone wanted to see the novelty. This woman had come to Taipingkou from her home the day before because her husband was doing business on the construction site. Auntie Peng had a son who participated in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and was also on the construction site. But they were with the large group. Auntie Peng was afraid that there would be no place to stay overnight at the construction site, so she asked someone to send a message to her son, asking if she could come. Her son replied that he had already asked the team leader and that she could stay overnight in the work shed, as they were all fellow villagers and she should come. Auntie Peng received the reply and set off from home to the construction site.
    The child in the woman's arms suddenly started crying, for some reason. Auntie Peng shouted loudly at the crying child, "What are you crying for, you're having such a good life! Feed him." After the child calmed down, Auntie Peng began to recount to everyone:
    "Really, in all my life, who has ever seen such a thing?" She looked at the old man sitting opposite her. "Last night, I went there with them. A high wall erected with iron frames stretched from this side to the other, without end. I thought, how big of a house are they building? But looking closely, it didn't look like a wall. Looking again, I finally recognized it. I said, such a big bridge, where does it lead to? They all laughed when they heard this. My son said to me: 'Mom, this is not a bridge, this is a sluice.' They were still laughing. I said, what are you laughing at? Has an old woman in her sixties or seventies ever seen a sluice? Later, I asked my son, how is this sluice used? He said: 'Whenever we want to let the river water in, we open the sluice and let the water in; whenever we want to keep the river water out, we lower the gate. Then the water can't cause trouble anymore.' But, I still couldn't see clearly. A field was completely covered with electric lights. You say, where should I look? There was no end to it. Here are electric lights, there are electric lights, shining on people brightly. Watching and watching, one can't help but feel happy. When those working took a break during their work, I asked my child: such a thing has never happened once in thousands of years, and how many eras will it take to have it again! He said that many large reservoirs will be built in the future, and large hydroelectric sluices will be built on the Yangtze River. Such things will become more and more frequent in the future, all the way to socialism and communism. By then, I don't know what it will become?..."
    The more Auntie Peng spoke, the happier she became. Her face, full of wrinkles, even revealed a kind of naive expression. But, when she talked about the past, her tone suddenly changed.
    Auntie Peng said that before liberation, one year, many crops were harvested. Auntie Peng's family calculated that if they hadn't owed Feng Dechang a few dou of rent the year before, the grain would have been enough to eat until autumn. However, they still had a few acres of soybeans to harvest. So they planned to harvest the soybeans to pay back the rent. Who would have thought that the water would come before the soybeans were harvested. If it weren't for those few dou of rent, the old man would never have watched the water come and still taken a sickle to the field. If it weren't for the help of the people in the village, they wouldn't have even found the old man's body. Last winter, the village carried out land reform. Auntie Peng's family was allocated land and a house. Now people have subdued the ferocious flood. If the old man was still here, to let him see this day....
    The steamer followed the river, traveling on the winding waterway. Now, the steamer had moved from the left bank to the right bank. Looking west from the right bank of the Yangtze River, this was the flood diversion area established by the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Many lakes and marshes shone through the dense reeds. On the levee that had been built, people participating in the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project carried baskets back and forth. In the distance, one could also hear the songs of the people working in the sun.
        "Look, when the sluice is built, and the water is released here, this
    area will become a vast ocean. No one thought that the world would change so fast. The further we go, the better the days will be." The old man sitting opposite Auntie Peng muttered, looking at the land full of lakes and marshes.
    The old man's words awakened Auntie Peng, who was lost in thought, and reminded her of what she hadn't finished saying:
        "I heard that in the future, many large reservoirs and hydroelectric sluices will be built, and this vast ocean will become dry land again, from which green crops will grow. I think, then it will be socialism. I don't know if we can still see it?"
    "Why not? I think we can see it," the old man nodded, affirming.
    "That's not a matter of three or five years. Think, growing crops in a vast ocean, how long will that take? ... But sometimes I think like this, and when I'm happy, people will live longer, maybe we can still see it. Look, isn't that Ming's child from your village?"
    A group of children who had followed the people participating in the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project to the levee stood on the high bank. They raised their hands and shouted and jumped "Heh heh" at the approaching steamer. The waves raised by the passing steamer hit the levee, making a crashing sound. The steamer traveled along the levee for a while, then left the levee and sailed into the heart of the river. The golden light of the sun, which had risen into the sky, flowed forward with the rushing river, like an endless golden road stretching forward. The small steamer moved forward on that rushing road, carrying people's beautiful hopes and moving towards a happier road.

    美好的希望

    一个早晨，在荆江分洪工程的工地上，一只停泊在太平口码头旁边的小汽船上挤满了人。这是准备从太平口开往沙市的第一班轮船。工地上的炊事员，合作社的供销员以及在工地上做买卖的小商贩，都在这时候搭船到沙市去，以便在下午赶回工地来。他们带着许多的筐筐担担，把一只小汽船弄得拥挤不堪。
    “太阳都这么高了，怎么还不开呵！”一个六、七十岁的老太太，屈着两腿坐在一个小包袱上，在那些拥挤的人们中间叫嚷起来。
    “大概是等人都来齐了才开呢，可是船都快挤不下了。”一个年纪和老太太差不多的老头子说。
    “应该按钟点呵！”老太太说。
    其实钟点还没有到，不过是老太太心里着急罢了。
    一列给工地运输器材的帆船，从太平口向着长江下游驶去。刚刚从江水里升起的太阳，把一片金光洒在水上。船上继续上了一些人。响过汽笛，船就慢慢开动了。
    这时候，有一个最后赶上船来的中年妇女，手上抱着一个几个月的小孩，挤到那个老太太的旁边来，向老太太打着招呼：
    “彭大妈，想法给孩子找个地方吧，怎么挤成这样？”
    “就在这里坐下来吧，怎么这时候才来？真是……，什么星宿降生的王太子？这么老远也把他抱来，上上下下的。”
    “还是他奶奶出的好主意。在家的时候，我就说，又不是出去十天半月，留在家里，那里找不到几顿奶吃？可是他奶奶非要把他抱出来不成，说是几十百代没有过的事情，让孩子也看看吧！她可不知道多累人呵！”
    这一个妇女和彭大妈是一个乡里人，离沙市十多里地。她的丈夫在荆江分洪工程还没有开始的时候，就和家里商量好，在太平口搭了一个小棚子，从沙市贩些火柴、手巾、肥皂，卖给工地上的人们。工程开始以后，从工地上到乡里去的人就宣传开了，说工程怎样伟大，简直是开天辟地以来都没有过的事情。于是大家都想去看看稀罕。这个妇女因为丈夫在工地上做买卖，前天就从家里到太平口来了。彭大妈有个儿子，参加了荆江分洪工程，也在工地上。但他们是大伙儿在一起的。彭大妈害怕在工地上没有地方过夜，就托人带了个口信给她儿子，问他是不是可以去。儿子回答说，他已经问过队长，可以在工棚里过夜，这里都是乡亲，要来就来吧。彭大妈得到回信，就从家里起身到工地上来。
    那个妇女手上抱着的小孩子，不知道为什么，突然哭起来了。彭大妈对使劲哭着的孩子，大声地说：“哭什么，好日子都叫你们过了！给他吃吧。”孩子平静以后，彭大妈在大伙儿中间述说起来：
    “真是活了这一辈子，谁看见过？”她用眼睛看了一看坐在她对面的那个老头子。“昨天夜里，我跟他们到了那里。一座用铁架起来的高墙，从这边望到那边，望不到头。我想，究竟要起多大的房子？但是仔细一看，又不像是墙。再一看，我到底认出来了。就说，这么大的桥，通到那里去？他们一听，哈哈大笑。我孩子对我说：‘妈，这不是桥，这是水闸。’他们还在笑。我说，你们笑什么？那个六、七十岁的老婆子看见过水闸呀？后来我就问我孩子，这个水闸怎样用法？他说：‘什么时候要把江水放进来，就把水闸打开，让水进来；什么时候要把江水关住，就放下闸门。以后水就不能作怪了。’可是，我还是看不清楚。一片野地里全挂满了电灯。你说该往那里看？那里也看不到头。这里也是电灯，那里也是电灯，照得人一身光灿灿的。看着看着，不由人心里不开花。等他们做工的在工作中间休息的时候，我问我那孩子：像这样的事，千百年来都没有过一次，今后也得多少年代才能有一次的吧！他说，将来还要建筑许多大水库，在长江上还要建筑发电的大水闸。像这样的事情，往后是越来越多，一直到社会主义，共产主义的时候。到了那时候，真不知要变成什么样子？……”
    彭大妈越说越高兴，她那满是皱纹的脸上，甚至流露出了一种天真的表情。但是，当她说到过去的时候，她的声调忽然变了。
    彭大妈说，解放前有一年，许多庄稼都收下来了。彭大妈一家人计算着，如果不是前一年欠了冯德昌几斗租子，粮食足够吃到秋后。不过，他们还有几亩豆子没有收。于是他们就打算把豆子收下来还那几斗租子。谁料想豆子还没有收割，水就来了。如果不是因为那几斗租子，老头子绝不会看着水来了还拿上镰刀往地里跑。如果不是乡里的人帮忙，连老头子的尸首都找不回来呀。去年冬天，乡里进行了土地改革。彭大妈家里分到了地，也分到了一间房子。现在人们又把那凶恶的洪水制服了。如果老头子还在，叫他看看这个日子……。
    汽船顺着江水，在弯弯曲曲的河道上行驶。现在，汽船又从左岸驶到右岸来了。从长江右岸往西一直望过去，这就是荆江分洪工程所建立的分洪区。许多湖沼透过密密丛丛的芦苇，发着一片闪光。在那一道已经修筑起来的堤岸上，参加建设荆江分洪工程的人们挑着筐子来来往往。远远地，还可以听见那些在阳光下劳作的人们的歌声。
        “你们看，等水闸修好了，把水放到这里来，这
    一片就要变成汪洋大海。谁也没有想到，这世界变得这样快。越往后，日子就越好过了。”坐在彭大妈对面的那个老头子一边望着那一片布满湖沼和芦苇的土地，一边喃喃地说。
    老头子的话唤醒了正在沉思默想的彭大妈，使她又重新想起刚才没有说完的话来：
        “听说将来把许多大水库和发电的大水闸修起来，这一片汪洋大海又要变成旱地，从那里长出绿油油的庄稼。我想，那时候就要到社会主义了。可不知道我们还能看见不能？”
    “怎么不能？我想能看见了。”老头子点点头，肯定地说。
    “那不是三年五年的事情。你想，在汪洋大海里长上庄稼，那得多少时候？……不过有时候我也这样想，心里欢畅了，人也会活得长，也许还能看见也说不定。你看，那不是你们乡里的那个明伢子？”
    一群跟着那些参加建设荆江分洪工程的人们跑到堤上来的小孩，站在那一道高高的堤岸上。他们举起双手，向驶来的汽船“呵呵”地喊着、跳着。驶过的汽船所掀起的浪花击打着堤岸，发出一片哗哗的响声。汽船沿着堤岸走了一会，就离开堤岸驶到江心去了。已经升到天空的太阳的金光，和奔流的江水一同向前奔流，好像一条无尽地向前伸延的金色的大道。小汽船在那奔流的大道上前进，带着人们的美好的希望，走向更加幸福的道路。
