Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 30th—The 18th International Red Cross Conference, disregarding the motion proposed by the delegation of the People's Republic of China to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, violating the will of the Chinese people and infringing upon the rights of the Chinese people, unreasonably passed a resolution on the 28th to allow the Kuomintang representatives to continue attending the meeting. This resolution violates the International Red Cross Charter and organizational principles. During the discussion, the Brazilian representative, in order to shield his accomplices and help them escape their embarrassing situation, hastily suggested amending certain clauses of the International Red Cross Charter and various rules. This shows how they violated these charters and principles.

At the conference on the 28th, Slavin, the chief representative of the Soviet Red Cross Society, spoke first. He exposed the illegal act of the chairman, MacAulay (Canada), who deliberately prevented the Soviet delegation from speaking during the discussion on the expulsion of the Kuomintang representatives on the 27th. MacAulay deliberately pretended not to see and not to hear the Soviet delegation's request at that time. In the face of Slavin's stern condemnation, MacAulay had to apologize and say: "I'm very sorry! ... This was not intentional!"

Soviet government representative Zonov and representatives of Czechoslovakia and Romania firmly supported China's motion, demanding the immediate expulsion of the Kuomintang bandits. Zonov emphasized that only the Red Cross Society and the government of the People's Republic of China can attend the conference. The representatives of the Kuomintang clique have no right to be here and should not be allowed to participate. Their attendance not only undermines the organizational principles of the conference but is also an act of hostility towards the Chinese people. Many representatives of American vassal states, such as Ecuador, Venezuela, and Cuba, came forward to cover up for the Kuomintang bandits. The Czechoslovak representative aptly quoted an American journalist who said that these countries must obtain permission from the U.S. State Department for whatever they do.

Before the chairman decided to adjourn the meeting for 45 minutes to allow the council to consider the proposal submitted to the conference, Su Jingguan, the chief representative of the Chinese government delegation, spoke. Su Jingguan first exposed the illegal act of François-Poncet, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross, in withholding the joint statement of the Chinese government and Red Cross delegations. Then, Su Jingguan once again stated that the Standing Committee's decision to allow the Kuomintang bandits to continue attending the conference not only infringed upon the rights of its legitimate members—the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Red Cross Society—but also undermined the principles of the charter and various rules. "If the Kuomintang remnants are allowed to illegally remain in the conference to carry out sabotage activities, if a gang that only relies on foreign fleets to maintain its parasitic existence is allowed to participate in the conference, it will seriously affect the moral standing and future of the international Red Cross movement."

After the American side prepared the voting machine, the plenary session reconvened and listened to the proposal of the conference council—which was just a new version of the old decision of the Standing Committee. At the meeting, the absurd proposal to allow the Kuomintang remnant bandits to continue attending the meeting was unreasonably passed by 58 votes to 25 (with 5 abstentions).

### 国际红十字大会在美国操纵下  竟通过让蒋匪帮代表继续出席的荒谬提案

    国际红十字大会在美国操纵下
    竟通过让蒋匪帮代表继续出席的荒谬提案
    【新华社多伦多三十日电】第十八届国际红十字大会无视中华人民共和国代表团所提出的驱逐国民党残余匪帮代表的动议，违反中国人民的意志并侵害中国人民的权利，在二十八日无理地通过了让国民党代表继续出席会议的决议。这个决议是违反国际红十字章程和组织原则的。在讨论中，巴西代表为了庇护他的同伙，使他逃脱狼狈的境地，不惜急急忙忙地建议修改国际红十字章程和各项细则的某些条款。由此可见他们是怎样地违反了这些章程和原则。
    在二十八日的大会上，苏联红十字会首席代表司拉文首先发言。他揭露了主席马考莱（加拿大）在二十七日讨论驱逐国民党代表问题时，故意不让苏联代表团发言的非法行为。马考莱当时对苏联代表团的要求，故意装作没有看见，没有听见。在司拉文的严正斥责的面前，马考莱不得不道歉说：“对不起得很！……这并不是有意的！”
    苏联政府代表左诺夫和捷克斯洛伐克代表、罗马尼亚代表都坚决地支持中国的动议，要求马上驱逐国民党匪帮。左诺夫着重指出：只有中华人民共和国的红十字会和政府能出席大会，国民党集团的代表没有权利到此地来，也不应让他们参加。他们的出席，不仅破坏了大会的组织原则，而且也是对中国人民的敌意行为。出面为国民党匪帮打掩护的有许多美国仆从国的代表，如厄瓜多尔、委内瑞拉和古巴等。捷克斯洛伐克代表恰当地引了一个美国记者的话说，这些国家无论干什么事都要得到美国国务院的许可。
    在主席决定会议休息四十五分钟以便让理事会考虑向大会提出的提案之前，中国政府代表团首席代表苏井观发言。苏井观首先揭露国际红十字常设委员会主席法朗索阿—庞赛扣留中国政府和红十字会代表团的联合声明的非法行为。接着，苏井观再一次声明说：常设委员会让国民党匪帮继续出席大会的决定，不仅侵犯了它的合法成员——中华人民共和国和中国红十字会——的权利，而且也破坏了章程的原则和各项细则。“要是允许国民党残余分子非法留在大会里进行破坏活动，要是允许一个仅仅倚靠外国舰队而维持其寄生存在的匪帮参加大会，那就会严重地影响国际红十字运动的道义地位和前途。”
    在美国方面准备好表决机器之后，全体大会重新开始，听取大会理事会的提案——这不过是常设委员会旧决定的新版，会上，以五十八票对二十五票（五票弃权）无理通过了让国民党残余匪帮继续出席会议的荒谬提案。
