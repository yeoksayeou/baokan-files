    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Publishes Editorial
    On the Victory of Forces Restoring Freedom and Peace for Duclos

    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The latest issue of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" published an editorial entitled "The Failure of French Police and Fascist Provocations - A Victory for the Forces of Peace," commenting on the release of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos.

    The editorial stated: All progressive humanity sincerely congratulates Comrade Duclos on his release, considering it a major victory in the French people's struggle to defend peace and national independence, and a major defeat for the warmongers.

    Duclos was able to be released primarily because millions of French men and women launched a massive protest movement, resolutely expressing their determination to block the path of war and fascism; at the same time, it was also due to the international solidarity movement launched by peace-loving people in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic countries, and the capitalist countries. American aggressors cannot tolerate the existence of a strong peace movement in France and other capitalist countries; therefore, they ordered their French lackeys to arrest and frame Duclos. However, the French people were not intimidated; many lower-level members and local organizations of the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church, various trade unions, Republicans, non-party members, and even some bourgeois figures stood with the Communists, denouncing the authorities' fascist conspiracy and demanding the release of Duclos.

    The struggle to demand the release of Duclos and the decision of the investigation chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal to release Duclos under the pressure of this struggle, once again demonstrates the contradictions and divisions within the French ruling class, and shows that some strata of the bourgeoisie are increasingly strongly opposed to the policy of subservience to American imperialism. At the same time, Duclos's release also confirms the correctness of the French Communist Party's policy, which is striving to strengthen the unity of the working class in order to unite all patriots to form a national united front to fight for peace and independence.

    The editorial pointed out: Duclos's heroic struggle in prison will forever be a brilliant example for French Communists, and he greatly helped the Party expose and shatter the Americans' conspiracy and inspired the struggle of French patriots. Recently, representatives of tens of thousands of working people and intellectuals have submitted applications to join the Party to Duclos in prison. With this new victory, tens of thousands more working people will certainly join the Communist Party. This particularly powerfully demonstrates that the Pinay government's attempt to weaken and isolate the French Communist Party is hopeless.

    The editorial finally emphasized: The French Communist Party and all working people know that reactionary forces will not fail to create new provocations and conspiracies now and in the future, because the policies of American imperialism cannot be implemented without fascist repression. Therefore, increasing vigilance is a matter of urgency. In any case, the forces of peace will surely be able to secure the release of Stili and other heroic peace fighters, and will surely be able to completely shatter the anti-people conspiracies of the French government and its American masters.

### “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表社论  论杜克洛恢复自由与和平力量的胜利

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表社论
    论杜克洛恢复自由与和平力量的胜利
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：最近一期的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”以“法国警察和法西斯挑衅的失败——和平力量的胜利”为题，发表社论，评论法国共产党书记杜克洛的获得释放。
    社论说：全体进步人类都衷心祝贺杜克洛同志的释放，认为这是法国人民保卫和平和民族独立的斗争的一个重大胜利，是战争贩子的重大失败。
    杜克洛之所以能获得释放，首先是因为千百万法国男女展开了声势浩大的抗议运动，坚决表示一定要堵住战争和法西斯主义的道路；同时，也因为苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和各资本主义国家爱好和平的人民展开了国际声援运动。美国侵略者不能容许法国及其他资本主义国家有强大的和平运动存在；因此，他们就命令他们的法国走狗逮捕和陷害杜克洛。但是，法国人民并没有被吓倒，社会党和天主教会的许多下层成员和地方组织、各工会、共和分子、无党派人士，甚至一些资产阶级人士，都和共产党人站在一起，痛斥当局的法西斯阴谋，要求释放杜克洛。
    要求释放杜克洛的斗争以及巴黎上诉法院侦察庭在这个斗争的压力之下决定释放杜克洛一事，再一次说明了法国统治阶级中的矛盾和分歧，说明了资产阶级中某些阶层正在越来越强烈地反对臣服于美帝国主义者的政策。同时，杜克洛的获得释放也证实了法国共产党的政策之正确，法国共产党正在努力加强工人阶级的团结，以便团结一切爱国者组成民族统一战线，为和平、独立而斗争。
    社论指出：杜克洛在狱中进行的英勇斗争，永远是法国共产党人的光辉榜样，他大大地帮助了党揭穿和粉碎美国人的阴谋，鼓舞了法国爱国者的斗争。最近，成千成万的劳动人民和知识分子的代表已经向狱中的杜克洛递上了入党申请书。随着这次的新胜利，一定又有成千成万的劳动人民要参加共产党。这就特别有力地说明了比内政府想削弱和孤立法国共产党的企图是绝望的。
    社论最后着重指出：法国共产党和全体劳动人民晓得：反动力量现在和将来都不会不制造种种新的挑衅和阴谋，因为不靠法西斯镇压就无法执行美帝国主义的政策。因此，更加提高警惕就是当务之急。无论如何，和平力量一定能够使斯梯及其他英勇的和平战士获得释放，一定能够彻底粉碎法国政府及其美国主子反人民的阴谋。
