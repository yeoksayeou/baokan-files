The New China Brings a Happy Life and Bright Future to Youth
    ——A Record of a Symposium at Peking University on Adjusting People's Scholarships
    Jin Feng

    Not long ago, the news that all middle school students this year could be promoted to universities was published in the newspapers. Recently, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a notice on adjusting the people's scholarships for students in national universities and secondary schools. It is not difficult to imagine the excitement and encouragement of the youth, as the new China brings them infinite happiness and a bright future. On July 13th, this journal invited several professors and students from Peking University to discuss their thoughts. This fully reflects this excitement and encouragement.

    "The motherland, the Party, and the people understand, love, and care for us young people the most." All the students at the symposium said this. They talked about how the people's scholarships had been adjusted time and time again since liberation, and the students' meals had improved day by day. Three years ago, the table was set with millet, sorghum, and boiled cabbage; a year or two ago, it was dark steamed buns and rice cakes; after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, they ate soy milk and jujube rice cakes in the morning, and white steamed buns, rice, eggs, meat, and fresh vegetables for lunch and dinner. The greatly improved meals guaranteed the students' health. However, some students with no financial resources still found it difficult to buy stationery and books. Now, the government provides all students with meals and also provides living allowances based on their circumstances. In this way, the difficulties are resolved, and the students can concentrate all their energy on studying. At this point, Sheng Wenlan, a student from the Chinese Department, said: "The motherland is really like a loving mother, considerate and caring for us at all times."

    The students talked about the ongoing struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Huai River project, the Jingjiang flood diversion project, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the fact that the country is investing more funds in construction. They felt the government's special care for young people even more and were excited about the rapid growth and strengthening of our great motherland's economic power. When they talked about the large-scale economic construction that was about to begin, they were overjoyed for their infinitely bright future.

    "The era when Chinese youth lost their schooling, lost their jobs, couldn't afford tuition and meals, were driven out of the classroom, couldn't pass university entrance exams, and wandered the streets is gone forever," Professor Ji Xianlin said meaningfully. Chinese youth have come from the poverty, humiliation, and pain of yesterday, and they cannot help but constantly associate everything with the dark past. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past, impoverished children were excluded from the school gates. Li Zhenduo, who participated in the symposium, was from a peasant family, and Ma Shaolong was the son of a clerk. Ma Shaolong barely finished elementary school, and Li Zhenduo barely finished junior high school, after which they both dropped out of school. Ma Shaolong worked as an apprentice for six years, relying on his own perseverance to complete the junior high school curriculum through self-study. Li Zhenduo rang bells at the Qilu University Seminary and scrubbed floors and stoked furnaces for the pastors. While ringing the bells, and after twelve hours of exhausting apprentice labor, Li Zhenduo and Ma Shaolong still propped up their tired eyelids and picked up their textbooks. But they could conquer their fatigue, dead numbers, and formulas, but they could not change the living reality - no money, no entry to school. When Li Zhenduo applied to Qilu University based on equivalent academic ability, the school authorities bluntly asked him: "Do you have money to pay tuition and fees?" Li Zhenduo knew that no matter how well he answered the exam, the answer to this question would determine his fate. He braced himself and replied: "Yes." He was admitted, but he could not afford the tuition fee of five bags of flour, and he dropped out after studying for a month. Ma Shaolong used his savings to enter high school, but while studying, he worried that the money was running out. And what would happen after graduating from high school? The future was bleak, and he dared not think about it.

    The plight of young people in old China struggling to study was so tragic. Qiu Jiaxiang, a sophomore in the Geology Department, had a mother who was an elementary school teacher, but she lost her job in 1947, and the burden of the family fell on Qiu Jiaxiang, who was still in the first year of high school, and his younger brother, who was in junior high school. This was in Shanghai. Every day after school, the brothers ran to hotels, restaurants, cafes, and cinemas in the central area to sell books and newspapers. They started selling from 6:00 p.m. every day and went home at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m., and had to go to school at 6:00 a.m. If it was windy or rainy and the newspapers could not be sold, the whole family would go hungry. And studying was so difficult: six or seven hours of running around every day, with only two meals of thin porridge for nutrition, the body couldn't support it, and they would doze off in class. After struggling to listen, there was no time to review when they got home, and there was no money to buy books. For three years of high school, Qiu Jiaxiang borrowed books from his classmates every time he took an exam. After selling newspapers and returning home, he stayed up all night to prepare for the exam. During winter and summer vacations, when other students were resting and reviewing their lessons, Qiu Jiaxiang and his younger brother had to brave the cold wind and scorching sun all day to sell books and newspapers to pay off the debts accumulated from a semester and prepare some expenses for the next semester.

    Jin Xiangfa, a sophomore in the Geology Department, and Hu Jiaxiang, a student in the Economics Department, both deeply felt the happiness of this year's high school students. This year's high school graduates will all happily step into universities. But what about the past? Jin Xiangfa graduated from high school in 1947, and borrowed money to go to Shanghai to take the university entrance exam. His financial resources did not allow him to take the exam for private universities, so he had to take the exam for Jiaotong University, which had 20% public expense quotas. In that year, more than 40,000 people registered to take the exam for Jiaotong University. More than 7,000 people registered for the Mechanical Engineering Department he applied for, and the quota for admission was 25 people. His chance was one in 280. He failed. When he returned home, he was so thin that even his family members could not recognize him. Teachers, relatives, and family members ridiculed him: You can't even pass the university entrance exam, you've studied for nothing. But he was not the only one who studied for nothing, but thousands and tens of thousands. In 1947, public and private universities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas enrolled about 10,000 students, while nearly 50,000 students in Shanghai alone took the entrance exam. Hu Jiaxiang was also one of those who was thrown out in this way.

    The word "liberation" is filled with joy and tears of joy for young students, just like it is for the suffering workers and peasants. After liberation, Hu Jiaxiang rushed from Hubei to Beijing, but he had already missed the exam period; as a result of applying to the Ministry of Education and the Peking University Academic Affairs Office, he had the opportunity to take the exam and entered Peking University. Li Zhenduo, Ma Shaolong, and Qiu Jiaxiang all enjoyed people's scholarships. If the scholarships were not enough, the classmates lent them sanitary clothing and woolen sweaters in winter, and sent them shirts and shoes in summer. How warm the motherland's big family was to them! In the past, Jin Xiangfa, Li Zhenduo, and Ma Shaolong had all thought that as long as someone could help them go to school, they would regard him as a benefactor and would never forget him for the rest of their lives. Now they understand: such a benefactor can only be Chairman Mao, the new China led by the Communist Party, and the people of the new China!

    When Ma Shaolong thought that now there is such a Party and People's Government that is more loving than his parents, and the people are eagerly expecting him to forge ahead bravely, he honestly examined himself and found that he still had weaknesses brought from the old society: he often thought about pursuing personal honor and only wanted to arrange a comfortable life for himself. Now he said to himself: "This is shameful." He promised to step up his ideological transformation, serve the people wholeheartedly, and respond to the motherland's concern for him. In the past, Hu Jiaxiang emphasized that his personal health was not good, he did not study hard, and he did not often participate in sports activities. Now he promised to concentrate on studying, exercise his body, and be a good cadre who can adapt to the needs of the motherland.

    As Professor Feng Zhi said, the future of young people in the new China is infinitely bright, and the road is getting brighter and brighter. They realize that the current happiness is just beginning, and the future will be even better. They are determined to participate in the creation and construction of a better future. Li Zhenduo is willing to be a literary worker, but if the motherland needs it, he is also happy to be a people's teacher. Geological work is the sentry of industrial construction, and Qiu Jiaxiang and Jin Xiangfa, who are studying geology, are willing to go to the most difficult places, to Xinjiang and Tibet, to explore the underground treasures of the motherland. They want to turn the border areas of the motherland into fertile fields and build the world's rooftop garden in Tibet.

    新中国为青年带来幸福的生活和美好的前途
    ——记北京大学师生关于调整人民助学金的一次座谈会
    金凤
    不久以前，报上公布了今年中学生全部均可升入高等学校的消息。最近中央人民政府政务院又发布了关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知。新中国为广大青年带来无限的幸福和美好的前途，青年们的兴奋鼓舞是不难想像的。七月十三日，本刊邀请北京大学几位教授和同学座谈他们的感想。这里充分反映出了这种兴奋鼓舞的情绪。
    “祖国、党和人民，最了解、最爱护也最关怀我们青年。”在座谈会上，所有的学生都这样说。他们谈到解放以后，人民助学金一次次地调整，学生的伙食一天天地改善。三年前，桌子上摆的是小米饭、高粱和煮白菜；一、两年以前是黑馒头和丝糕；“三反”“五反”以后，早上吃豆浆、枣丝糕，中午、晚上是白面馒头、大米饭、鸡蛋、肉和新鲜菜蔬。大大改善了的伙食，保证了学生们的健康。但是还有一部分完全没有经济来源的同学，感到购买文具书籍有些困难。现在政府全部供给同学伙食，还要根据情况发给生活津贴费。这样，困难解决了，同学们可以集中全部精力学习了。谈到这里，中文系同学盛文澜说：“祖国真是像慈母一样对我们体贴入微，无时无刻不在关心我们。”
    同学们谈到现在正在进行着的抗美援朝斗争，修淮河、修荆江分洪工程和成渝铁路，以及国家正要以更多资金投入建设时，更感到政府对青年的特别关怀，并为我们伟大祖国经济力量的迅速成长壮大而振奋。谈到即将开始的大规模经济建设时，他们为自己无限远大的前途而欢欣鼓舞。
    “中国青年学生失学、失业，交不起学费、膳费，被赶出课堂，考不上大学，流浪街头的时代，是一去不复返了。”季羡林教授意味深长地说。中国青年学生从昨天的贫困屈辱和痛苦中走过来，他们不能不处处联想到灰黯的过去。过去在国民党统治区，贫困的子弟是被摈斥在学校大门之外的。参加座谈会的李振铎是农家子弟，马少龙是号房的儿子。马少龙只勉强念完小学，李振铎只勉强念完初中，以后就都失学了。马少龙当了六年学徒，靠自己的毅力自修完初中的课程。李振铎在齐鲁大学神学院敲钟，替牧师擦地板和生炉子。在敲钟的时候，在一天十二小时精疲力尽的学徒劳役以后，李振铎和马少龙还是撑起酸困的眼皮，拿起了课本。但他们征服得了自己的疲倦、死的数字和公式，却没有办法改变活的现实——没有钱，不能进学校。李振铎以同等学力投考齐鲁大学时，学校当局赤裸裸地问他：“有没有钱交学杂费？”李振铎知道不管他的试卷答得多么好，这个问题的答案将决定他的命运。他硬着头皮回答：“有的”。他被录取了，但他交不起五袋面粉的学费，念了一个月又退出来。马少龙用自己的积蓄进了高中，但一面学习，一面忧虑着积蓄的钱愈来愈少。而高中毕业以后又怎样呢？前途渺茫，他不敢想下去。
    旧中国青年为学习而挣扎的情景是这样悲惨。地质系二年级学生邱家骧的母亲当小学教员，一九四七年失了业，家庭的重担就落到还在高中一年级念书的邱家骧和在初中读书的他的弟弟的肩上。这是在上海。每天放学以后，兄弟俩跑到中心区的旅馆、饭店、咖啡馆、电影院去卖书卖报。每天从下午六点开始去卖，到夜里一、两点回家，早晨六点就又要上学。逢到刮风下雨，报卖不出去，全家就要挨饿。而学习又是这样艰难：每天六、七小时的奔波，只有两顿稀饭的营养，身体支持不住，上课时就打瞌睡。挣扎着听完了，回家没有复习的时间，也没有钱买书本。高中三年，每次考试的时候，邱家骧都是临时借同学的书本。在卖完报回来后，他通夜不睡，准备考试。寒假和暑假，别的学生正是休息和温习功课的时间，但是邱家骧和他的弟弟，却要冒着凛冽的寒风和酷热的太阳整天卖书卖报，来偿还一个学期积欠下来的债务，准备一些下学期的费用。
    地质系二年级学生金祥法和经济系学生胡嘉骧都深深感到今年高中学生的幸福。今年的高中毕业生将全部愉快地踏进高等学校。而过去怎样呢？金祥法一九四七年就在高中毕了业，借了钱到上海考大学。他的经济力量不允许他考私立大学，只好去投考有百分之二十公费名额的交通大学。当年报名考交通大学的有四万多人。他所报考的机械系有七千多人报名，录取名额是二十五人。他的机会是二百八十分之一。他失败了。回家来，人瘦得连家里人都认不得他。教员、亲戚和家里人都讥笑他：大学都考不上，书白念了。但白念了的并不是他一个，而是几千、几万个。一九四七年国民党区公私立高等学校招收学生约一万多名，仅上海的投考学生就将近五万人。胡嘉骧，也是被这样抛出去的一个。
    “解放”这个字眼对于青年学生是和对于受苦受难的工人农民一样充满着欢愉和欢愉的眼泪。解放以后，胡嘉骧从湖北赶到北京来，已经过了考期；向教育部和北大教务处申请的结果，他有了考试的机会，进了北大。李振铎、马少龙和邱家骧都享受了人民助学金。助学金还不够所需，同学们冬天借卫生衣和绒线衫、夏天送衬衫和鞋子给他们。祖国的大家庭对于他们是多么温暖啊！在过去，金祥法、李振铎和马少龙都想过，只要谁能帮助他们上学，他们要把他当恩人来感谢，一生一世不会忘记他。现在他们才明白：这样的恩人只能是毛主席、共产党领导的新中国和新中国的人民！
    马少龙在想到现在有了这样比父母还慈爱的党和人民政府，人民正殷切地期待着他奋勇前进时，他诚实地检查了自己，发现自己还有从旧社会带来的弱点：他曾经常常想到追求个人的荣誉，光想给个人安排舒适的生活。现在他向自己说：“这是可耻的。”他保证要加紧思想改造，全心全意为人民服务，以回答祖国对自己的关怀。胡嘉骧过去强调个人身体不好，没有刻苦学习，不常参加体育活动，现在他保证要专心学习，锻炼身体，做一个能适应祖国需要的好干部。
    像冯至教授所说的，新中国青年的前途无限光明，路是愈走愈亮的。他们认识到现在的幸福才在开始，将来将更美好。他们决心参加更美好的将来的创造和建设工作。李振铎愿意做文艺工作者，但如果祖国需要，他也高兴担任人民教师。地质工作是工业建设的哨兵，学地质的邱家骧和金祥法都愿意到最艰苦的地方去，到新疆、西藏去，发掘祖国的地下宝藏。他们要使祖国的边疆变为肥沃的原野，在西藏建设世界的屋顶花园。
