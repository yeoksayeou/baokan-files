Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th: At the afternoon session of the World Peace Council's special meeting on the 3rd, the speeches by Guo Moruo, Han Xueye, and Fache on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and condemnation of the United States for conducting germ warfare had a tremendous impact.

At the beginning of the meeting, Guo Moruo spoke first, proposing five suggestions for an immediate end to the Korean War. His suggestions were enthusiastically supported by the participants, with representatives from various countries unanimously agreeing that this proposal was a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue.

Korean representative Han Xueye then spoke, fiercely condemning the United States for conducting increasingly large-scale germ warfare. He said: This barbaric act will never intimidate the Korean people. The Korean people yearn for national independence and freedom, and they yearn for world peace. They are resolutely and courageously fighting against the aggressors. Han Xueye called on peace-loving people to unite more closely and fight to immediately stop the inhumane treatment of prisoners of war by the American imperialists and strive for the successful conclusion of the armistice negotiations, thereby resolving the Korean issue peacefully. His speech was also enthusiastically supported by the participating representatives.

The third speaker was Fache, whose speech received the most attention at the afternoon session. Fache is a firsthand witness to the germ warfare conducted by the United States. He recently collected many conclusive facts on the Korean front and in China, and personally spoke with Chinese scientists, ordinary people, and American prisoners of war. He described the situation of the germ warfare conducted by the American imperialists and pointed out that all righteous people in the world must take measures to stop this barbaric crime. His convincing speech deeply moved everyone in the audience. After he finished his speech, all the participants unanimously stood up to express their solidarity with the Korean people.

During the intermission, the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg expressed his feelings to Xinhua News Agency reporters, saying: "I have lived for such a long time, and I have never been as moved as I was today after listening to Mr. Fache's speech. This is not because of his eloquence. I want to point out two things: First, after hearing about the difficult situation of the Korean people and the heroic struggle they are waging, anyone in the world with a little conscience will express heartfelt sympathy; from Mr. Fache's speech, it can be seen more clearly how selflessly the Chinese people are helping their Korean brothers; Second, the reason why Mr. Fache's speech was such a great success is due to his sense of justice and profound humanism." Ehrenburg's words fully expressed the common feelings of the representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world who participated in this meeting.

    郭沫若、韩雪野和法奇的发言
    受到世界和平理事会各国代表的热烈支持
    【新华社柏林五日电】在世界和平理事会特别会议三日下午会议上，郭沫若、韩雪野和法奇关于和平解决朝鲜问题及谴责美国进行细菌战的发言，产生了极大的影响。
    会议开始时，郭沫若首先发言，他提出立即停止朝鲜战争的五点建议，受到与会者的热烈支持，各国代表一致认为这个建议是和平解决朝鲜问题的公正合理的办法。
    朝鲜代表韩雪野继起发言，他猛烈谴责美国所进行的规模越来越大的细菌战，他说：这种野蛮暴行是决吓不倒朝鲜人民的。朝鲜人民渴望民族独立与自由，渴望世界和平，他们正在坚决地、英勇地对侵略者进行战斗。韩雪野号召爱好和平的人民更紧密地团结起来进行斗争，立即制止美帝国主义者对战俘的不人道待遇，争取成功地结束停战谈判，从而以和平方式解决朝鲜问题。他的发言同样受到与会代表的热烈支持。
    第三位发言的是法奇，他的演说在下午会议上最受注意。法奇是美国进行细菌战的当场见证人，他最近在朝鲜前线和中国搜集了许多确凿的事实，并亲自和中国科学家、普通人民以及美国战俘谈过话。他叙述了美帝国主义者进行细菌战的情形，并指出全世界所有正义的人民必须采取措施来制止这种野蛮罪行。他的使人信服的演说，使全会场的每一个人都深受感动。在他结束演说后，全体与会者一致起立表示与朝鲜人民团结一致。
    在会议中间休息时，苏联名作家爱伦堡对新华社记者发表感想说：“我活了这样大年纪，还没有像今天听了法奇先生的演说这样感动过。这并不是由于他的口才好。我要指出两点：第一，听到朝鲜人民所处的困难境况和朝鲜人民所进行的英勇斗争的情形，世界上只要还有一点良心的人，都会表示衷心的同情；从法奇先生的演说里，可以更为明确地看出：中国人民是怎样忘我地帮助他们的朝鲜兄弟；第二，法奇先生的演说之所以得到伟大的成功，是由于他的正义感和深刻的人道主义。”爱伦堡的这些话充分表达了参加这次会议的全世界爱好和平的人民的代表们的共同的感想。
