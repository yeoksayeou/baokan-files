    Zhoujiazhuang Farmers Research Cotton Aphid Control Techniques

    Editor: The farmers of Zhoujiazhuang Village in Jin County, Hebei Province, have formed an agricultural technology research association, which has played a very good role in every agricultural season, and the farmers trust it very much. Since the beginning of summer this year, cotton in the village has been infested with aphids. Some farmers believe that the cotton seedlings are too small at this time, there are few aphids, and there is a lack of sprayers, so there is no way to treat them. Cao Tongyi (agricultural labor model), director of the agricultural technology research association, went to the county farm to study and research aphid control techniques. After returning, he first conducted experiments with the members of the research association and studied two methods for controlling aphids and protecting seedlings, which were taught to the farmers. The first method is to make a brush shaped like a toothbrush out of burlap, dip it in the medicinal solution, and brush it upwards from under the cotton seedlings. This method can replace the sprayer. The second is to use "egg cotton oil emulsion" and "1605 pesticide" to control aphids and also control red spiders. These two medicines are simple to prepare, save labor and materials, and one tael of "1605" can be mixed with 900 to 1200 jin of water (Editor's note: "1605" is very toxic, do not touch the skin during preparation; the prepared medicine is best used up at once, and the efficacy will be reduced if it is left for a long time).

    All 197 mutual aid teams in the village followed these methods to control insects. By July 5th, in just one week, the 1,025 mu of cotton fields in the village that were infested with cotton aphids had been universally treated once. In the past two days, each cotton plant has grown four to eight fruiting branches and five to ten flower buds. The farmers praised the technology research association for being effective.

    周家庄农民研究除治棉蚜技术
    编辑同志：河北晋县周家庄村农民组成一个农业技术研究会，这个研究会在每个农事季节里都起了很好的作用，农民都很信任它。今年入夏以来，村里棉花生了蚜虫。有些农民认为这时棉苗过小，蚜虫还少，喷雾器缺乏，没法治。农业技术研究会主任曹同义（农业劳动模范）就到县农场去学习和研究治蚜技术，回来以后，先和研究会的人员进行试验，研究了两条治蚜保苗的办法，传授给农民，这两个办法，第一是用麻皮做成牙刷形的刷子，蘸着药水，从棉苗下面往上涂刷。这个办法可以代替喷雾器。第二是用“鸡蛋棉油乳剂”和“一六○五药水”治蚜，并可兼治红蜘蛛。这两种药，配制简单，省工省料，一两“一六○五”可以兑水九百到一千二百斤（编者按：“一六○五”很毒，配制时不要触及皮肤；药剂配好后，最好一次用完，放久了就会减低药效）。
    全村一百九十七个互助组，按照这些办法治虫，到七月五日止，只一周功夫，全村发生棉蚜的一千零二十五亩棉田，已经普遍治了一遍。这两天，棉花每棵已长有四个到八个果枝，五个到十个花蕾。农民们都赞扬技术研究会顶事。
