Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Bangkok dispatch: Overseas Chinese in Thailand are launching a large-scale petition movement to oppose the unreasonable measure of the Thai government to increase the "Alien Identification Certificate Fee" by twenty times.

On February 4th of this year, the Thai Supreme Administrative Council passed a "decree" to increase the "Alien Identification Certificate Fee" from 20 baht to 400 baht per person per year. (Each baht is equivalent to 1040 yuan RMB. 400 baht is equivalent to more than a month's salary for an average white-collar worker.) The purpose of this unreasonable measure by the Thai government is to persecute and extort the Chinese, who account for 90% of the foreigners in Thailand. According to this "decree," a family of five would have to pay a huge sum of 2,000 baht a year; this would effectively make it impossible for the vast majority of overseas Chinese in Thailand to live.

Because they cannot afford such heavy "fees," the vast number of overseas Chinese in Thailand have launched widespread petitions and reasoning, demanding a reduction in the "fees." In many cities and villages, groups of hundreds to thousands of overseas Chinese have gathered to petition in front of Thai government offices, police stations, and the residences of senior officials. As of June 20th, more than 200,000 overseas Chinese in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand have written to the Thai authorities requesting a reduction in the "fees." The overseas Chinese masses have also asked members of parliament in various Thai provinces to convey their demands for lower "fees" to the Thai authorities. The vast majority of Thai people sympathize with the plight of the overseas Chinese and are closely following the development of this event. Many parliamentarians have also publicly expressed their sympathy.

Disregarding the reasonable demands of the vast number of overseas Chinese, the Thai government reaffirmed on June 20th that the "Alien Identification Certificate Fee" would be 400 baht, with exemptions only for the elderly, weak, orphans, widows, and the disabled.

In recent years, Thailand has experienced economic stagnation, inflation, and rising living costs. The average wage earner among the overseas Chinese in Thailand currently earns only about 300-400 baht per month, while the monthly household expenses for a family of three are at least 500 baht or more; even without the identification certificate fee, it is difficult to make ends meet. As for the general overseas Chinese merchants, they are also in a state of near-bankruptcy due to the sharp drop in prices of tin, rice, and imported goods. The implementation of this "decree" will plunge the majority of overseas Chinese into despair. There have been daily reports of overseas Chinese in Thailand being forced to commit suicide because they cannot make a living.

### 我在泰侨胞展开大规模的请愿运动  反对泰国政府无理提高“外侨随身证例费”

    我在泰侨胞展开大规模的请愿运动
    反对泰国政府无理提高“外侨随身证例费”
    【新华社二十二日讯】曼谷消息：在泰国的华侨正在展开大规模的请愿运动，反对泰国政府提高“外侨随身证例费”达二十倍的无理措施。
    今年二月四日，泰国最高行政会议通过了一项“法令”，把“外侨随身证例费”从每人每年泰国币二十铢增加到四百铢。（每铢合人民币一千零四十元。四百铢约合普通脑力劳动者每人一个多月的薪水收入）泰国政府这一无理措施的目的，是要对占泰国外侨百分之九十的华侨进行迫害和勒索。按照这个“法令”，五口之家的华侨一年就要缴纳二千铢之巨；这实际上将使在泰国的绝大多数华侨无法生活。
    泰国广大华侨因为无法负担如此苛重的“例费”，广泛展开了请愿说理，要求减轻“例费”。在许多城市和乡村，华侨集结成百人到几千人的队伍，到泰国的官厅、警署和高级官员的住宅前请愿。到六月二十日为止，曼谷和泰国其他地方的华侨，已有二十多万人写信给泰国当局要求减轻“例费”。华侨群众也要求泰国各府的国会议员向泰国当局转达减低“例费”的要求。泰国广大人民都同情华侨的处境，并密切注意这一事件的发展。许多议员们也都公开表示同情。
    泰国政府不顾广大华侨的合理要求，在六月二十日重申“外侨随身证例费”为四百铢，仅老弱孤寡残废者可申请通融。
    泰国近年来，百业停顿，通货膨胀，生活费用日高。在泰华侨普通一工薪劳动者，目前每月的收入约仅三、四百铢，而三口之家的每月家庭开支，至少在五百铢以上，即无随身证例费，已难维持生活。至于一般侨商，因锡米及进口货价格惨跌，亦陷入半倒闭状态。此项“法令”的实行，将更陷华侨大众于绝境。我在泰侨胞因无法生活而被迫自杀的已日有所闻。
