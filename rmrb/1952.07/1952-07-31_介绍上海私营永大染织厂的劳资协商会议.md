Introducing the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting of Shanghai Private Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory

	Shanghai Private Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory is a relatively large factory. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, on the one hand, the workers established a sense of ownership and clearly distinguished themselves ideologically from the bourgeoisie, and production enthusiasm generally increased; on the other hand, some workers developed overly left-leaning sentiments. Most senior staff members returned to the ranks, but they did not know how to draw a line with the capitalists ideologically and in terms of their stance, and showed reluctance to talk to the capitalists, reluctance to eat at the same table with the capitalists, and so on. The capitalists, during the "Five-Anti" movement, were listed as key investigation targets. After the "Five-Anti" ended, they felt uneasy, fearing the loss of their political status, and therefore wanted to push everything to the trade union. The capitalist's agent—the factory director—was also very negative in his attitude. As a result, labor-management relations and production were not normal.
	In response to the above situation, the factory trade union first convened a factory-wide workers' meeting to convey the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' instruction "on uniting capitalists to improve production," and organized workers to discuss it, so that workers generally realized that capitalists, after eliminating the "five evils," still had a positive role in production, and that they should actively unite with the capitalists to improve production. Then, the trade union convened a forum for senior staff members, educating them to realize that adhering to principles, distinguishing between good and bad, being bold and responsible, and doing a good job in their work, was the true way to stand firm, and the true way to draw a line with the capitalists. As a result, the senior staff members also changed their work attitudes.
	Because the workers improved production, and correctly grasped the principles of equality, voluntariness, and mutual benefit in the labor-management consultation meetings, and united the capitalists to improve production, the capitalists also increased their enthusiasm for management. On this basis, labor and management successively signed two production contracts, thereby stabilizing labor-management relations. Capitalist Tang Zhiyao told the trade union that he planned to add thirty-six looms, prepare funds to renovate the factory buildings, and plan to purchase land to build warehouses and dining halls.

	The key to stabilizing labor-management relations and improving production is to hold good labor-management consultation meetings. How to hold good labor-management consultation meetings? Trade union cadres must grasp the policy of mutual benefit for labor and management, must grasp the principles of equality and voluntariness, and respect the capitalist's management rights, personnel deployment rights, and financial control rights. The factory had held five labor-management consultation meetings, and at the beginning, it also took some detours. For example, in the first labor-management consultation meeting, the labor representatives urged the capitalists to solve problems in a lecturing manner, but as a result, no specific problems were solved, and the capitalists' negative attitude was not changed. In order to implement the policy of uniting capitalists to improve production, before the second consultation meeting, the trade union cadres corrected the left-leaning sentiments of some cadres. Therefore, the second meeting could be held in an atmosphere of unity and equality. First, the labor representatives reported that workers' production had recently increased by 14.4 percent, and at the same time, on the principle of not spending money and not adding people, they put forward two rationalization proposals: workshop transfer system and material quota system. The capitalists realized from the specific facts that the trade union was seriously uniting the capitalists to carry out production, and respected the capitalist's administrative power, and also proposed four draft plans for production management reform for the trade union to study. After the meeting, the capitalists immediately convened a factory affairs meeting and formally adopted the workers' rationalization proposals.
	In order to ensure that the labor-management consultation meeting can smoothly solve production-related issues, it is very important to do thorough preparation work. There are two main contents of the preparation work: 1. Collect mass opinions and sort out consultation proposals. The trade union studied the issues related to production and welfare raised by various departments, and prioritized the issues that must be resolved and can be resolved, and made proposals. Before the consultation meeting, these proposals were given to the capitalists for consideration. At the same time, the trade union should also organize workers and staff to discuss the proposals put forward by the capitalists. After exchanging opinions before the meeting, both parties can have sufficient time to consider the issues, which makes it easier for both parties to reach an agreement, so that the consultation meeting can proceed smoothly and solve problems quickly. 2. Before the meeting, the trade union should convene a workers' representative meeting to unify the representatives' opinions, so that the workers' representatives' speeches at the consultation meeting are consistent, and it is necessary to estimate the development of the meeting in advance, and grasp the direction of the meeting.
	The labor-management consultation meeting should focus on discussing production issues. For example, in the past, workers in the factory were absent from work without asking for leave and hired substitutes without going through certain procedures, causing personnel chaos. This problem had not been resolved for a long time. The capitalists recently proposed a plan for sorting out substitutes at the consultation meeting, requesting that all substitutes working for less than three months be dismissed. After the trade union understood the absenteeism situation in the factory at that time, it proposed that in the future, the employment of temporary workers should be uniformly applied for by the factory to the labor exchange in accordance with government regulations. For substitutes who are currently working in the factory, temporary employment contracts should be signed according to work needs. This basically solved the substitute problem. The labor side also put forward reasonable demands related to production and welfare on the basis of improving the production management system and ensuring the completion of production tasks. These requirements were accepted by the capitalists. For example, at the third and fourth labor-management consultation meetings, the labor side's requests to add production tools and hire more nurses were agreed to by the capitalists.
	When implementing the resolutions of the consultation meeting, the capitalists had concerns that the staff would not be willing to implement the resolutions. Therefore, promoting the capitalists to implement the resolutions of the consultation meeting through the factory affairs meeting is a better way. At the same time, the trade union should also strengthen its leadership over the staff through trade union work and assist the capitalists in solving specific difficulties in implementing the resolutions of the consultation meeting.
	On the basis of achieving relatively stable labor-management relations, sign a labor-management production contract to further consolidate labor-management relations. The labor-management production contract is a contract that clarifies the responsibilities and obligations of both labor and management in production, and provides mutual guarantees, so as to better complete the state's processing and ordering tasks. The joint signing and implementation of the production contract by labor and management is an important link in implementing the resolutions of the consultation meeting and improving production. The content of the contract should be realistic and as much as can be done should be stipulated. After labor and management signed the production contract for May, both parties fulfilled the contract in ensuring the completion of production tasks. By the end of June, production had increased by 16.6 percent compared with before the "Five-Anti" movement.

    介绍上海私营永大染织厂的劳资协商会议
    韩武成
     （一）
    上海私营永大染织厂，是一个比较大的工厂。经过“五反”斗争，一方面，工人群众树立了主人翁思想，划清了与资产阶级的思想界限，生产热情普遍提高；另一方面，也有些工人产生了过左的情绪。大部分高级职员归了队，但不知道如何从思想、立场上和资本家划清界限，而表现为不愿和资本家讲话，不愿和资本家同桌吃饭等等。资本家在“五反”运动中，被列为重点检查户，“五反”结束后，情绪不安，怕失去政治地位，因而什么事都想推给工会。资方代理人——厂长的情绪也十分消极。因此，劳资关系和生产都不正常。
    该厂工会针对上述情况，首先召开了全厂工人大会，传达了上海总工会“关于团结资本家搞好生产”的指示，并组织工人讨论，使工人普遍明确认识了资本家在消除了“五毒”以后，在生产上仍然有积极的作用，应该主动地团结资本家搞好生产。接着，工会又召集高级职员开座谈会，教育他们，使他们认识了要坚持原则，分清好坏，大胆负责，搞好业务，才是真正站稳立场，才是真正与资本家划清界限。因而，高级职员也改变了工作态度。
    由于工人提高了生产，在劳资协商会议上又正确地掌握了平等、自愿、两利的原则，团结资方搞好生产，因此资方也提高了经营的积极性。在这一基础上，劳资双方连续签订了两次生产合约，从而稳定了劳资关系。资本家唐志尧向工会表示，拟增添布机三十六台，准备资金翻修厂房，计划购地建筑仓库和饭厅。
     （二）
    稳定劳资关系，搞好生产的关键，是开好劳资协商会议。怎样开好劳资协商会议呢？工会干部必须掌握劳资两利政策，必须掌握平等、自愿的原则和尊重资方的经营管理权、人事调配权和财务支配权。该厂曾先后开了五次劳资协商会议，在开始的时候，也曾走了一些弯路。如在第一次劳资协商会议时，劳方代表以训话的方式督促资本家解决问题，但结果并没有解决任何具体问题，资本家的消极态度也没有转变。为了贯彻团结资本家搞好生产的政策方针，在第二次协商会议以前，工会干部纠正了部分干部的偏左情绪，因此，第二次会议就能在团结、平等的气氛中进行。首先由劳方代表报告了最近工人生产提高百分之十四点四的情况，同时在不花钱、不添人的原则下，提出了工场转账制与物料定额制两个合理化建议。资本家从具体的事实中，认识了工会是认真团结资方进行生产的，是尊重资方行政权的，也提出了四个生产管理上的改革草案给工会研究。会后，资方立即召开厂务会议，正式通过采纳工人的合理化建议。
    为了使劳资协商会议要能顺利地解决有关生产上的问题，做好充分准备工作是十分重要的。准备工作有两项主要内容：一、收集群众意见，整理协商提案。工会研究了各部门提出的有关生产和福利的问题，把目前必须解决、而且可以解决的问题，分别轻重缓急，作成提案。在开协商会前，把这些提案交资方考虑。同时对于资方所提出的提案，亦应组织职工群众讨论。经过会前交换意见，可使双方有充分时间考虑问题，易使双方意见接近，使协商会议能顺利进行，且能迅速解决问题。二、开会前，工会应开工人代表会，统一代表意见，使工人代表在协商会议上的发言意见一致，并且事先须估计会议发展情况，以及掌握会议的方针。
    劳资协商会议，应以讨论生产问题为中心。比如，该厂过去工人缺勤不请假，不通过一定手续自请替工，造成人事上的混乱，这一问题长期未获解决，资方最近在协商会议上提出了整理替工方案，要求把三个月以下的替工一律解雇。工会了解了当时厂中缺勤情况后，就提出今后雇用临时工应按政府法令一律须由厂方向劳动介绍所申请雇用，对正在厂里工作的替工，应根据工作需要签订临时雇用契约，这样就基本上解决了替工问题，劳方也在改进生产管理制度、保证完成生产任务的基础上，提出有关生产及福利方面的合理要求。这些要求，资方都接受了。如在第三、四次劳资协商会议上，劳方提出的添置生产工具，和增聘护士的要求，都得到了资方的同意。
    在实行协商会议的决议时，资方有怕职员不肯执行决议的顾虑。因此，推动资方通过厂务会议来贯彻执行协商会议决议，是较好的办法。同时工会也应通过工会工作，加强对职员的领导，协助资方解决在贯彻协商会议的决议中的具体困难。
    在劳资关系取得相对稳定的基础上，签订劳资生产合约，进一步巩固劳资关系。劳资生产合约，是以契约的形式，使劳资双方在生产上明确职责与义务，相互保证，以便很好地完成国家加工订货任务。劳资双方共同签订和执行生产合约，是实现协商会议决议，搞好生产的重要环节。合约的内容要做到切合实际情况，能做多少就订多少。该厂劳资双方签订五月份的生产合约后，双方都履行了在保证完成生产任务方面的契约。到六月底，产量比“五反”运动前提高了百分之十六点六。
