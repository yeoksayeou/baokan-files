Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Since the beginning of this year, workers in various industrial sectors in the United States have continuously launched strikes to demand increased wages and improved working conditions. The scale of the developing strike movement demonstrates that no anti-labor legislation or other fascist measures can suppress the will of the American working class to fight for the protection of their living rights.

One of the characteristics of the strikes held by the American working class this year is their large scale and wide impact. In several industries, nationwide strikes have been launched, which not only affected the United States domestically, but also hit the entire capitalist camp. For example, the nationwide strike of American oil workers, which began at the end of April, not only caused a serious oil shortage in the United States, but also largely paralyzed aviation activities throughout the capitalist world. Air force training programs in the United States and even other countries such as Britain and Canada were also forced to be completely or partially suspended due to the lack of aviation fuel. On June 2nd, 650,000 steel workers across the United States launched the fourth major strike in history, which paralyzed 95% of the American steel industry. It not only severely hit the United States' own war production, but also affected the export of munitions and steel, and even directly threatened the supply of important munitions to the American troops invading Korea.

According to materials from the US Department of Labor, in April of this year, strikes left one million people unemployed, totaling 5.3 million lost workdays. This is a new peak since the post-war strike wave in the United States in February 1946. The scale of the strikes in the past two months has far exceeded that of April. In June alone, the steelworkers' strike caused more than 10 million lost workdays.

These large-scale strikes occurred in basic industries and transportation sectors such as railways, telecommunications, petroleum, and steel, and therefore had a particularly large impact on the American economy. The steelworkers' strike has nullified the expansion of steel production in the United States after the outbreak of the Korean War to implement the military build-up plan. The strike has disrupted or completely halted many expansion or construction plans under the military build-up plan, including the expansion of important military factories and sites. The strike also caused more than one million workers in other industries such as railways, mining, petroleum, construction, and automobiles to stop working.

The American working class has demonstrated a high degree of organization and a strong fighting will in the strikes. When railway workers went on strike in early March, railway traffic on the New York Central Railroad west of Buffalo was completely shut down within hours of the strike decision. In other cases, such as the strike by Western Union telecommunications workers and the national steelworkers' strike, the workers were prepared and stopped working according to plan as soon as they received the strike order. The workers persisted in their struggle despite the threat of anti-labor legislation. The oil workers' strike lasted for more than three weeks. The steelworkers' strike has lasted for nearly seven weeks. The West Coast maritime workers' strike is one week away from being two months long. In the course of persisting in the strike struggle, they not only demonstrated internal unity, but also received the support of other workers. For example, the United Mine Workers of America donated more than 10 million US dollars to support the steelworkers' struggle.

The unusual development of the strike movement this year can also be evidenced by the shock of the American ruling group. The Truman administration is increasingly relying on so-called "government takeover" measures for enterprises and entire industrial sectors where strikes occur. The Taft-Hartley Act, which was formulated by the American ruling group during the 1946 major strike wave specifically to deal with strikes, is the most reactionary labor legislation in American history. Now, the American ruling group feels that even this legislation is of no avail. Representatives of monopoly capital have introduced various more violent bills in Congress to suppress strikes.

In the strike struggles of the American working class, right-wing trade union leaders follow a reactionary political line, try their best to isolate strikes from the realistic political struggle, collude with the government and capitalists at critical moments, protect the interests of monopoly capital, or compromise halfway and undermine the strike struggle. However, the awareness of the broad masses of workers is constantly growing, and they are increasingly combining their economic demands with political demands, demanding an end to the Korean War, the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and disarmament. More and more people realize that it is the war and the arms expansion and war preparation policies that bring them a heavier burden. The labor peace conferences including representatives of various trade unions held in Chicago, San Francisco, and other places not long ago are manifestations of this trend.

### 美罢工运动迅速发展

    美罢工运动迅速发展
    【新华社十七日讯】今年以来，美国各工业部门中接连不断地爆发了工人们为要求增加工资、改善劳动条件而举行的罢工。罢工运动发展的规模说明了，任何反劳工立法或其他法西斯措施都压制不了美国工人阶级为保卫自己生活权利而进行斗争的意志。
    美国工人阶级今年举行的罢工的特点之一是规模大、影响广。在好几种工业里，都发动了全国性的大罢工，其影响不仅及于全国，并且打击了整个资本主义阵营。例如，四月底开始的美国石油工人全国规模的大罢工，不只在美国国内造成严重油荒，并且使整个资本主义世界的航空活动大量陷于瘫痪。美国以至英国、加拿大等其他国家的空军训练计划也因航空用油缺乏而被迫全部或局部中止。六月二日，美国全国六十五万钢铁工人举行了历史上第四次的大罢工，它麻痹了百分之九十五的美国钢铁工业，不仅沉重地打击了美国本国的战争生产，还影响到军火及钢铁的出口，甚至直接威胁到侵朝美军重要军火的供应。
    据美国劳工部材料，今年四月份，罢工使一百万人没有工作，总共损失了五百三十万个工作日。这是一九四六年二月份美国战后罢工高潮以后的新高峰。这两个月来的罢工规模又远远超过了四月份。在六月份仅仅钢铁工人的罢工，就造成了远在一千万以上工作日的损失。
    这些大规模的罢工发生在铁路、电讯、石油、钢铁等基本工业与运输部门之中，因此对美国经济的打击特别大。钢铁工人的罢工已使美国在朝鲜战争爆发后为实行军备计划而扩充的钢铁生产归于乌有。罢工使得军备计划下的许多扩充或建设计划包括重要的军事工厂、场地的扩建受到波折以至完全陷于停顿。罢工并使铁路、采矿、石油、建筑、汽车等其他工业一百多万工人停止工作。
    美国工人阶级在罢工中表现出高度的组织性和坚强的战斗意志。三月初铁路员工举行罢工时，在决定罢工后几小时内，纽约中央铁路公司在布法罗以西地段的铁路交通就完全停顿。其他如西方联合公司电讯工人的罢工和全国钢铁工人的罢工，工人们都是有准备地一得到罢工令就按计划停止工作。工人们不顾反劳工立法的威胁，坚持地进行斗争。石油工人的罢工坚持了三个多星期。钢铁工人的罢工已坚持了近七个星期。西海岸海员工人的罢工差一个星期就要有二个月了。他们在坚持罢工斗争中，不仅表现了内部的团结，而且得到其他工人的支援。例如联合煤矿工会就曾捐款一千多万美金，支持钢铁工人的斗争。
    今年罢工运动的不同寻常的发展，也可以从美国统治集团的震动得到证明。杜鲁门政府越来越依靠于对发生罢工的企业和整个工业部门采取所谓“政府接管”的措施。一九四六年大罢工浪潮下美国统治集团订出来专门对付罢工的塔夫脱—哈特莱法是美国历史上最反动的劳工立法。现在，美国统治集团已感到甚至连这种立法也无济于事了。垄断资本的代表们已在国会提出各种更加强暴的压制罢工的法案。
    在美国工人阶级的罢工斗争中，右翼工会领导遵循反动政治路线，竭力把罢工与现实的政治斗争隔离，在重要关头与政府及资方勾结，保护垄断资本的利益，或中途妥协，破坏罢工斗争。但是，广大工人群众的觉悟正不断增长，他们已愈来愈多地把他们的经济要求和政治要求结合起来，要求停止朝鲜战争、缔结五大国和平公约和裁减军备。愈来愈多的人了解到，正是战争和扩军备战政策给他们带来更沉重的负担。不久以前在芝加哥、旧金山等地分别召开的包括各种工会的代表的劳工和平会议，就是这种趋向的表现。
