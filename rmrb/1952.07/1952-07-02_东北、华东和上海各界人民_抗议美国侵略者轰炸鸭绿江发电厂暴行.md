Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. Local organizations of various democratic parties in Northeast China and people's organizations in Northeast China and Shenyang City have issued statements protesting the heinous crime of US imperialism in barbarously bombing the Yalu River Power Plant.

The joint statement by the Northeast Temporary Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Northeast General Branch Temporary Working Committee of the China Democratic League, the Shenyang City Branch Temporary Working Committee of the China Democratic League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association stated: "We protest with great anger against the heinous crime of US imperialism in bombing the Yalu River Power Plant! Like the inhumane germ warfare, this is the most brutal destruction of the peaceful life of the Korean people by the American bandits. While the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, the American bandits bombed the Yalu River Power Plant, which has no military facilities. This is a more blatant provocation after their repeated absenteeism from the armistice negotiations and the abuse and killing of our prisoners of war. They attempt to completely destroy the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression. However, the Chinese and Korean people are fully capable of crushing this conspiracy, so that what the American bandits cannot obtain in the armistice negotiations, they will not be able to obtain anywhere else. What they can obtain is only the complete failure of their ambitious aggression plan. They must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences of this atrocity! We are willing to work with all peace-loving people in the world to fight to the end to crush the war of aggression launched by US imperialism!"

The joint statement by the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Northeast Student Union, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Northeast Association of Health Workers, and the Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship Association stated: "The US aggressors' bombing of the Yalu River Hydropower Plant is a serious criminal act of shameless provocation against the people of Asia and the world. It thoroughly exposes the US aggressors' sinister plan of fundamentally not wanting to achieve an armistice and peace in Korea, and wanting to continue to expand their war of aggression against Korea. The US aggressors vainly attempt to carry out this shameful destruction of a peaceful facility with no military target, in order to display their so-called 'military pressure' which they have boasted about countless times but has failed, and attempt to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people. But we are convinced that in the face of the increasingly strong heroic Korean and Chinese military forces, this conspiracy of the US aggressors will be more thoroughly bankrupt. We, the people of Northeast China who stand at the forefront of the motherland's defense, have felt intolerable anger at this serious provocative act by the US Air Force on our border! We will certainly make greater efforts to implement increased production and thrift, strengthen our national defense, and support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, to give the barbaric American bandits the punishment they deserve."

The statement jointly issued by the people's organizations of Shenyang City stated: "We express our angry protest against the heinous crime of the US aggressors in frantically bombing the Yalu River Power Plant while delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. We are determined to increase production and practice thrift in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and to fight to the end for the cause of human peace!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st. People from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai angrily protested against the provocative act of the American aggressors in wantonly bombing the Yalu River Power Plant and other non-military facilities. The East China Branch of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association issued a statement saying: From this heinous and utterly evil crime of US imperialism, its conspiracy to deliberately undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and expand the Korean War is more fully exposed. We call on the 140 million people of East China to take stronger action, vigorously carry out the patriotic movement of increasing production and practicing thrift, and fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, to give the American aggressors heavier blows!

The statement of the Shanghai Branch of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Association pointed out: The American bandits' atrocities have exposed its baseness, shamelessness and stupidity more and more clearly each time. It can never frighten the Korean and Chinese people, nor can it change our just, correct and firm position on the armistice negotiations, but will only strengthen the iron will of the Korean and Chinese people to fight for peace.

The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing a million workers in Shanghai, issued a protest letter saying: The American aggressors' bombing of the non-military Yalu River Power Plant is the greatest provocation to peace in the Far East and the world. The American aggressors vainly attempt to exert its so-called "military pressure," which has already gone bankrupt, to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people and obtain what they cannot obtain at the negotiating table. Tell them that doing so will only further arouse the irreconcilable hatred of the Korean and Chinese people and the resolute opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. We Shanghai workers must step up production, effectively support the Korean front, and fight to the end to crush the barbaric provocative acts of the American aggressors in expanding the Korean War!

The joint statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and the Shanghai Municipal Student Union, as well as the statement of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, also severely condemned the US imperialists' arrogant conspiracy to expand the war and undermine peace.

Workers and citizens in Shanghai, who suffered from the bombing by US-Chiang bandit aircraft in the spring of 1950, even more strongly condemned the shameless crimes of US imperialism with intense indignation. Lu Agou, a nationally renowned advanced worker in Shanghai, said indignantly: "The peaceful life of the Korean people has once again been destroyed by US imperialism. Their disaster is our disaster. We Shanghai workers must step up production in the labor competition and support the Korean people." After seeing this news in the newspaper, propagandists of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and housewives in Shanghai immediately held discussions to condemn the criminal acts of US imperialism.

    东北、华东和上海各界人民
    抗议美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂暴行
    【新华社沈阳一日电】各民主党派在东北的地方组织以及东北区、沈阳市各人民团体分别发表声明，抗议美帝国主义野蛮轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的滔天罪行。
    中国国民党革命委员会东北临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟东北总支部临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟沈阳市支部临时工作委员会、民主建国会沈阳分会筹备委员会的联合声明说：“我们以极大的愤怒，抗议美帝国主义轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的滔天罪行！和灭绝人性的细菌战同样，这是美国强盗对于朝鲜人民和平生活最残暴的破坏。正在朝鲜停战谈判进行期间，美国强盗们轰炸了毫无军事设备的鸭绿江发电厂，这是他们在停战谈判中屡次逃会、虐杀我方战俘之后的更露骨的一次挑衅行为。他们企图彻底破坏停战谈判，扩大侵略战争。但中朝人民完全有力量粉碎这种阴谋，使美国强盗在停战谈判中得不到的东西，在任何地方也同样得不到，他们所能得到的，只是野心的侵略计划的彻底失败。他们必须对于这一暴行的严重后果负完全责任！我们愿和全世界所有爱好和平的人民一道，为粉碎美帝国主义所发动的侵略战争而奋斗到底！”
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会东北总分会、东北总工会、中国新民主主义青年团东北委员会、东北学生联合会、东北民主妇女联合会、东北文学艺术界联合会、东北卫生工作者协会总会、东北中苏友好协会的联合声明中说：“美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江水力发电厂，这是对亚洲及全世界和平人民进行无耻挑衅的严重犯罪行为。它彻底地暴露了美国侵略者根本不想在朝鲜获致停战与和平，并且要继续扩大其侵朝战争的罪恶计划。美国侵略者妄想以对这样一个非军事目标的和平设备进行可耻的破坏，来显示其无数次吹嘘过的但都已失败了的所谓‘军事压力’，并企图以此恫吓朝、中人民。但是我们确信：在日益壮大了的英勇的朝中人民军事力量面前，美国侵略者的这一阴谋活动必将遭到更彻底的破产。我们站在祖国国防最前线的东北人民，对于美国空军在我国边境上这一严重的挑衅行为，已感到不能容忍的愤怒！我们必将以更大地努力实行增产节约，壮大国防力量，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，给野蛮的美国强盗以应得的惩罚。”
    沈阳市各人民团体联名发表的声明说：“我们对于美国侵略者一面拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面疯狂轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的滔天罪行，表示愤怒的抗议。我们决心增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军，为维护人类的和平事业而奋斗到底！”
    【新华社上海一日电】华东和上海各界人民愤怒抗议美国侵略者滥炸鸭绿江发电厂等非军事设备的挑衅行为。华东抗美援朝总分会发表声明说：从美帝国主义这一灭绝人性的万恶罪行中，愈益充分地暴露了它蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。我们号召全华东一亿四千万人民更坚强地行动起来，大力开展爱国增产节约运动，全力支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，给美国侵略者更沉重的打击！
    上海市抗美援朝分会的声明指出：美国强盗的暴行，一次比一次更明显暴露它的卑怯、无耻和愚蠢。它决不可能吓倒朝中人民，也改变不了我方对停战谈判的正义的、正确的坚定立场，而只会更加强朝中人民为和平而斗争的钢铁意志。
    代表上海百万工人的上海总工会发表抗议书说：美国侵略者轰炸非军事设备的鸭绿江发电厂，这是对远东和世界和平的最大挑衅。美国侵略者妄想施展它早已破产了的所谓“军事压力”，借以恫吓朝中人民，而取得在谈判桌上所得不到的东西。告诉他，这样做，只能进一步激起朝中人民不共戴天的仇恨和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对。我们上海工人一定要加紧生产，有效地支援朝鲜前线，为粉碎美国侵略者扩大朝鲜战争的野蛮挑衅行为而奋斗到底！
    中国新民主主义青年团上海市工作委员会、上海市民主青年联合会筹备会、上海市学生联合会联合发表的声明及上海市工商业联合会的声明，也都严厉地痛斥美帝国主义扩大战争、破坏和平的狂妄阴谋。
    曾在一九五零年春遭受过美蒋匪机轰炸的上海市的工人和市民们更以强烈的愤慨痛斥美帝国主义的无耻罪行。全国著名的上海先进工人陆阿狗激愤地说：“朝鲜人民的和平生活又一次遭受了美帝国主义的破坏。他们的灾难就是我们的灾难，我们上海的工人一定要在劳动竞赛中，加紧生产，支援朝鲜人民。”上海市民主妇女联合会的宣传员和上海市家庭妇女在报纸上看到这一消息后，有的立即举行座谈，痛斥美帝国主义的罪恶行为。
