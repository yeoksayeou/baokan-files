    The Model Machine Tractor Station of Kuban
    By Li He, Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow
    On the morning of May 20th, the bright sunlight streaming through the train window woke us up. We found ourselves in a new place. The beautiful rural scenery of southern Russia filled the window frame: to the west, behind a low belt of fruit trees like a jade ribbon, stretched an endless expanse of green fields, and in the distance of this green sea full of crops, two islands emerged – the buildings of the field work teams; to the east, beside lush green trees, stood rows of white houses. Bathed in the soft morning light, the fields were so refreshing and lovely that we were drawn outside the carriage.
    This is the "Great Bear" station in Timoshevsky District, about forty or fifty kilometers north of Krasnodar City. We were following the third group of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation. The first and second groups of the delegation went to East and West Ukraine, the fourth group to Stavropol and Georgia, and the fifth group to Kazakhstan. We accompanied the third group to this Krasnodar Krai and the Azerbaijan Republic. We lived on a "mobile hotel," which consisted of a train carriage and a dining car. It moved across the vast Krasnodar plain.
    Krasnodar is the famous Kuban. It is located in the north of the Caucasus Mountains, bordering the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the east. On this fertile black soil plain of tens of thousands of square kilometers in the Kuban River basin, more than one hundred kinds of crops, such as wheat, corn, rice, sunflower, tobacco, and tea, are grown. Kuban is an advanced agricultural area in the Soviet Union, rich in grain, especially winter wheat. There are hundreds of machine tractor stations and collective farms here, which last year made Krasnodar the first in the entire Soviet Union to complete the task of delivering grain ordered by the state.
    We first visited the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station. In the morning, Comrade Malyuda, the station director, led the responsible cadres of the station to greet the delegation at the station and take them to their machine tractor station. The machine tractor station is not far from the station. The office, radio telephone exchange, repair shop, oil depot, power plant, etc., were built on a large piece of land surrounded by wooden fences. Station Director Malyuda—an agronomist who has worked in agriculture in Kuban for twenty-one years—enthusiastically introduced the situation of the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station to us at the club.
    We know that in the Soviet Union, machine tractor stations are a powerful lever used by the state to guide and help the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture and to develop and consolidate it. In 1927, the Shevchenko State Farm in the Odessa Region of Ukraine established a work team with ten tractors to help the surrounding poor and middle peasants. Based on the proposals of the peasants, the great Stalin instructed the establishment of socialized tractor stations throughout the country. During the period of complete collectivization of agriculture, the work progressed more smoothly in places where machine tractor stations had already been established. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, about half of the land of collective farms throughout the Soviet Union was cultivated by machine tractor stations. The "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station was established at that time. It has been around for twenty years from 1932 to now. In 1938, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor when it participated in the All-Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. It has been a model machine tractor station since 1947 and is one of the thirty-two model machine tractor stations in the entire Soviet Union. In 1951, it completed 119 percent of its production task, cultivated 108,000 hectares of cultivated land (all agricultural crops were converted into cultivated land work), saved 45 tons of fuel, and reduced the cost per hectare of cultivated land by 2 rubles and 80 kopecks.
    Inside the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station, there were many combine harvesters, some tractors, and other agricultural machines. A combine harvester operator, Leonov, started a self-propelled combine harvester for us to see. This machine harvested 300 hectares in 1951 and can harvest 20 hectares in one day. What we saw was only a part of the machines; many machines were working in the fields. This machine tractor station has a total of 150 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor), 48 combine harvesters, and 100 seeders, cultivators, and other agricultural machines. This is a large machine tractor station. It has a station director, a deputy station director in charge of political affairs, a deputy station director who is also the chief agronomist, a deputy station director who is also the chief mechanic, and many agronomists and mechanics. It has 220 tractor drivers, 48 combine harvester operators, 27 drivers, and some repair shop workers. Its large scale can also be proven by a few things we have seen.
    We visited its radio telephone exchange. The exchange uses radio telephones to communicate with the tractor teams working in the fields around 420 square kilometers. The exchange has a dispatcher who listens to oral reports from each tractor team every morning and reports the situation to the station director and chief mechanic. In this way, the station can quickly know the progress of field work, give timely instructions, assist the laggards, and dispatch mobile repair vehicles to machines that have broken down. Several of our comrades were sent to the fields more than ten kilometers away, and their voices were very clear when they spoke to us. We also visited the repair shop, which has a small electric welding room, a parts washing room, a forging room, a turning room, a tool room, an engine experimental room, etc. The machine tools there are all powered by electricity. This machine tractor station uses more than 1,000 tons of petroleum every year. We saw its small oil depot, which can store 240 tons of gasoline and heavy oil. Krasnodar is also an oil-producing area, close to the Baku and Grozny oil areas, which is an excellent condition for promoting agricultural mechanization.
    Before the collective farm merger movement in 1950, the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station worked for fourteen collective farms; after the merger, it served three large collective farms. These three collective farms have 29,500 hectares of land (one hectare is about 15 mu). With its help, 90 to 100 percent of the agricultural work of these collective farms is mechanized, such as plowing, harrowing, sowing wheat, corn, and industrial crops, and harvesting wheat, sunflower, and hemp are all 100 percent mechanized. It guarantees that the collective farms it serves achieve high yields. In 1951, each of its 15-horsepower tractors cultivated land that produced 11,800 poods of grain (one pood is equal to 32.76 jin), and each of its combine harvesters harvested 1,000 to 1,300 tons of grain per day on the land of the "Road to Communism" collective farm.
    Like all machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union, the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station plays a guiding role in the collective farms it serves, and they cooperate closely. This is manifested in the following aspects:
    First, the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station uses state-owned machines to work for three collective farms, and constantly masters new machines, new technologies, and labor organization methods to help the collective farms. For example, its staff members cooperated with the members of the collective farm this year to master the square spot sowing method for cultivated crops, and are now working hard to assist the mechanization of the animal husbandry industry in the collective farm. Its agronomists cooperate with the agronomists of the collective farm, such as guiding the latter in seed disinfection work. Because it possesses powerful mechanized production tools, it plays an obvious guiding role in the collective farm. For its work, the collective farm directly delivers a portion of the harvest to the state every year as remuneration. The increased income and benefits obtained by the collective farm due to the use of state-owned agricultural machines far outweigh their remuneration to the state many times over. Therefore, the relationship between the collective farm and the machine tractor station is very solid.
    Second, there is an organization of the council between the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station and the collective farms it serves. Before the merger of the collective farms, the council was composed of the station director and the chairmen of fourteen collective farms; after the merger, the council was expanded, and in addition to the station director, the three deputy station directors, and the chairmen of the three collective farms, there were also the tractor team leaders, the field production team leaders of the collective farms, and the directors of the livestock farms, with the station director serving as the chairman of the council. The council meets before important seasons such as sowing and harvesting, and invites the responsible persons of the district party and government and the staff of the district newspaper to participate in the meeting. The decisions of the council must be implemented by both the machine tractor station and the collective farm. Two days before our visit, the council held a meeting to discuss the harvesting of pasture grass and the preparation for harvesting grain.
    Third, the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station has seventeen tractor teams (each team has a captain, a deputy captain, team members, a statistician, and a fueler), and each team works on fixed land together with the field production team of a fixed collective farm. When the tractor team completes its work every day, it hands over the work results to the field production team leader who works with it. The latter carefully checks the quantity and quality of the tractor driver's work (for example, measuring the depth of the cultivated land), registers it, and uses it as the basis for the collective farm to pay remuneration to the state in the future. The tractor team and the field production team often hold production meetings to review the work and conduct socialist competitions. In this way, the two maintain close cooperation and have a high degree of responsibility.
    Fourth, the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station and the collective farms it serves sign contracts every year. The contract takes effect immediately after being signed by both parties and registered in the district Soviet. We saw the 1952 contract between the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station and the "Road to Communism" collective farm. The contract specifies the obligations of both parties in detail, including the type, quantity, quality, time limit, yield, and remuneration of the work, etc. The contract in fact contains the production plan formulated by both parties according to the state task.
    Fifth, in the Soviet Union, the main cadres of agricultural mechanization—tractor drivers—must be members of the collective farm; the collective farm sends excellent members to tractor training classes for three months every year, and they must return to their original collective farm to serve after graduation; they are cadres of the machine tractor station, and at the same time, they are still members of the collective farm; their labor is remunerated from both the machine tractor station and the collective farm. (As for combine harvester operators, they are cadres of the machine tractor station, and the station pays them labor remuneration because harvesting is seasonal work.) This principle of ensuring a steady stream of reserve cadres for the machine tractor station and ensuring the continuous improvement of agricultural technology in the collective farm is also followed by the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station and the collective farms it serves. In 1951, it trained 34 people sent by the collective farm into tractor drivers.
    According to Station Director Malyuda, the tractor drivers and combine harvester operators of the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station are excellent staff members. We can see this from the socialist competition achievement bulletin board of this station. For example, in mid-May, the seventh tractor team plowed 305 hectares with 12.9 tractors (calculated at an average of 15 horsepower per tractor) and saved 563 kilograms of fuel. We can also see this from the remuneration of the tractor drivers of this station. Originally, when a crawler tractor driver completes a day's quota, he can receive 25 rubles from the machine tractor station and one pood of grain from the collective farm as remuneration; if he also saves fuel when completing the quota, he can also receive half the value of the fuel he saved. Eighty percent of the tractor drivers of the "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station exceed the task, and they receive an average of 40 rubles from the station and one and a half poods of grain from the collective farm per day.
    We talked to Krasnitsky, a tractor driver from the eleventh tractor team of this station. He has been a tractor driver for twenty-one years. He, his wife, and his eldest daughter are all members of the "Road to Communism" collective farm. In 1951, he drove a "дT—54" tractor and cultivated 883 hectares of cultivated land (all agricultural work was converted into cultivated land work), completed 160 quotas, and received 800 workdays. He received 5 rubles of remuneration per workday from the machine tractor station, and 3 kilograms of wheat and 3 rubles and 34 kopecks of remuneration from the "Road to Communism" collective farm. At the same time, because he saved 630 kilograms of fuel, he received half the value of the fuel; because he saved materials when repairing the tractor, he received a bonus of 800 rubles. At the same time, because of his long service, he received an annuity equal to 10 percent of the 800 workdays for the whole year; because he is a first-class tractor driver, he also received an income equal to 10 percent of the 800 workdays for the whole year. In addition, last winter, he taught a month and a half of classes at a nearby mechanical school and received a salary of 1,350 rubles. Last year, his wife, who worked in the silkworm breeding production team in the collective farm, and his daughter, who worked in the vegetable production team, both received many workdays. He also has a thirteen-year-old son and an eleven-year-old daughter who are studying in the fourth and third grades of primary school for free. In the Soviet Union, the training of tractor drivers is encouraged, their remuneration is higher, and their lives are very prosperous.
    Machine tractor stations are enterprises used by the state to develop collectivized and mechanized large-scale agricultural production, and they are a bond used by the state to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The "Great Bear" Machine Tractor Station has drawn such a conclusion for us.

    库班的模范机器拖拉机站
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    五月二十日清晨，射进车窗的灿烂阳光唤醒了我们。我们发现到了一个新的地方。美丽的南俄农村风景映进窗框来：西面，在一条玉带似的果树矮林后面，展开着一望无际的碧绿田野，在这长满农作物的绿海远处，浮现着两个岛屿——田间工作队的建筑物；东面，在青翠茂盛的树木旁边，站着一座座粉白的房屋。在早晨柔和的阳光摩抚底下，田野是这样清爽可爱，我们被吸引到车厢外面去了。
    这是克拉斯诺达城以北四五十公里季摩舍夫斯基区的“大熊”车站。我们跟随着中国农民代表参观团的第三组。参观团的第一、二两组到东、西乌克兰，第四组到斯塔夫罗波尔和格鲁吉亚，第五组到哈萨克斯坦，我们跟随的第三组到这个克拉斯诺达边疆区和阿塞拜疆共和国。我们住在“流动的旅馆”上。这旅馆是一节火车厢和一节餐车组成的。它在广阔的克拉斯诺达原野上移动着。
    克拉斯诺达也就是著名的库班。它在高加索山脉的北部，东滨黑海和亚速海。在这库班河流域几万平方公里肥沃的黑土平原上，生长着小麦、玉蜀黍、稻、向日葵、烟草、茶叶等一百多种农作物。库班，这是苏联一个先进的农业区，盛产谷物，特别是冬小麦。这里有数以百计的机器拖拉机站和集体农场，它们在去年使克拉斯诺达在全苏联第一个完成了交给国家订购的谷物的任务。
    我们首先参观的是“大熊”机器拖拉机站。上午，站长马留达同志领着站上的负责干部，到车站来迎接参观团到他们的机器拖拉机站去。机器拖拉机站离车站不远。在木栅围着的大片土地上筑起了办公处、无线电话联络台、修理厂、油库、电力厂等等。马留达站长——这位在库班做了二十一年农业工作的农艺专家——在俱乐部向我们热心地介绍了“大熊”机器拖拉机站的情况。
    我们知道，在苏联，机器拖拉机站是国家用以指导和帮助农业集体化和机械化并使之发展和巩固的有力杠杆。在一九二七年，乌克兰敖得萨区谢甫钦科国家农场建立了有十辆拖拉机的工作队，帮助周围的贫农和中农。伟大的斯大林根据农民们的提议，指示在全国建立社会化的拖拉机站。在农业全盘集体化时期，凡是已经建立有机器拖拉机站的地方，工作都进行得比较顺利。到了第一次五年计划时期末，全苏联已经有约半数的集体农场的土地由机器拖拉机站来耕种。“大熊”机器拖拉机站就是当时建立起来的。它从一九三二年到现在，已经有二十年历史。一九三八年它在参加全苏农业展览会的时候得到了劳动红旗勋章。它从一九四七年起成为模范的机器拖拉机站，是全苏联三十二个模范机器拖拉机站中的一个。它在一九五一年完成了生产任务的百分之一百十九，耕熟地十万八千公顷（一切农作折成耕熟地工作计算），节约了四十五吨燃料，使耕熟地每公顷的成本减低二卢布八十戈比。
    “大熊”机器拖拉机站内摆着许多联合收割机和一些拖拉机和其他农业机器。一位联合收割机手李奥诺夫开动一辆自动推进的联合收割机给我们看。这辆机器在一九五一年收割了三百公顷，一天内可以收割到二十公顷。我们所看到的只是一部分机器，许多机器正在田间工作。这个机器拖拉机站共有一百五十辆拖拉机（以每辆十五匹马力计算）、四十八辆联合收割机和一百辆播种机、中耕机和其他农业机器。这是一个大型的机器拖拉机站。它有站长、管理政治的副站长、副站长兼总农艺师、副站长兼总机械师、许多农艺师和机械师。它有二百二十个拖拉机手、四十八个联合收割机手、二十七个司机和一些修械厂工人。它的规模之大，还可以从我们所见到的几件事来证明。
    我们参观了它的无线电话联络台。联络台用无线电话和在周围四百二十平方公里的田间工作的拖拉机队联络。联络台有一位调度员，他每天上午听取各拖拉机队的口头报告，把情况汇报站长和总机械师。这样，站上能够迅速地知道田间工作进行的情形，及时地予以指示，并且援助落后者，向发生故障的机器派出流动修理车。我们的几位同志被送到十多公里外的田间去，他们和我们通话时声音非常清楚。我们也参观了修械厂，那里有小型电焊间、洗零件间、锻铁间、镟切间、工具间、发动机实验间等等，那里的机床都是使用电力。这个机器拖拉机站每年用一千吨以上的石油。我们看到了它的小型油库，能贮藏二百四十吨汽油和重油。克拉斯诺达也是产油区，离巴库和格罗兹尼油区很近，这是推行农业机械化的一个优越条件。
    在一九五零年集体农场合并运动之前，“大熊”机器拖拉机站给十四个集体农场工作；合并之后，它为三个大集体农场服务。这三个集体农场有二万九千五百公顷土地（一公顷约合十五市亩）。在它的帮助之下，这些集体农场的农作百分之九十到百分之百机械化了，像耕地，耙地，播种麦、玉蜀黍和工业作物，收割麦、向日葵、麻都是百分之百机械化了。它保证它所服务的集体农场取得高度的收成。在一九五一年，它的每辆十五匹马力的拖拉机耕作的土地，出产了一万一千八百普特谷物（一普特合三二·七六市斤），它的每辆联合收割机在“到共产主义之路”集体农场的土地上，每天收割了一千到一千三百吨谷物。
    像苏联的一切机器拖拉机站一样，“大熊”机器拖拉机站对它所服务的集体农场起着指导作用，它们是密切合作的。这表现在如下几个方面：
    第一，“大熊”机器拖拉机站用国家的机器为三个集体农场工作，并且不断地掌握新的机器、新的技术和劳动组织方法，以帮助集体农场。例如，它的工作人员今年协同集体农场场员掌握了中耕作物的方形点播法，现在正在努力协助集体农场养畜业的机械化。它的农艺师和集体农场的农艺师合作，例如指导后者进行种籽消毒工作。由于它掌握着机械化的强有力的生产工具，它对集体农场起着显然的指导作用。对于它的工作，集体农场每年把收成的一部分直接交付国家作为报酬。集体农场因使用国家的农业机器而增加的收入和所得到的利益，远远地超出它们对国家的报酬好多倍。所以集体农场和机器拖拉机站的关系是非常巩固的。
    第二，“大熊”机器拖拉机站和它所服务的集体农场之间有理事会的组织。在集体农场合并之前，理事会是由站长和十四个集体农场主席组成的；合并之后，理事会扩大了，除了站长、三个副站长、三个集体农场主席之外，还有拖拉机队队长、集体农场的田间生产队队长和养畜场主任等参加，由站长担任理事长。理事会在播种、收割这类重要季节之前开会，会议时邀请区的党政负责人和区报纸工作人员参加。理事会的决定，机器拖拉机站和集体农场双方都要执行。在我们参观前两天，理事会曾举行会议，讨论了收割牧草和准备收割谷物问题。
    第三，“大熊”机器拖拉机站有十七个拖拉机队（每队有队长、队副、队员、统计员、加油员），每队和固定的集体农场的田间生产队一起，在固定的土地上工作。拖拉机队每天完成工作的时候，把工作成果点交给一起工作的田间生产队队长。后者认真地检查拖拉机手的工作数量和质量（例如测量所耕土地的深度），登记下来，作为将来集体农场付出报酬给国家的根据。拖拉机队和田间生产队之间经常举行生产会议检讨工作，并且进行社会主义竞赛。这样，两者保持着密切的合作，并具有高度的责任心。
    第四，“大熊”机器拖拉机站和它所服务的集体农场之间每年订立合同。合同经过双方签订并在区苏维埃登记后立即生效。我们看到了“大熊”机器拖拉机站和“到共产主义之路”集体农场的一九五二年合同。合同明细地规定着双方的义务，包括工作的种类、数量、质量、期限、收获量和报酬等等。合同事实上包含着双方根据国家任务而拟订的生产计划。
    第五，在苏联，农业机械化的主要干部——拖拉机手必须是集体农场成员；集体农场每年派送优秀的成员到拖拉机训练班学习三个月，他们毕业后要回到原来集体农场服务；他们是机器拖拉机站的干部，同时仍是集体农场成员；他们的劳动从机器拖拉机站和集体农场双方面得到报酬。（至于联合收割机手，却是机器拖拉机站的干部，由站上给予劳动报酬，因为收割是季节性工作。）这种保证机器拖拉机站后备干部源源不绝，保证集体农场农作技术不断提高的原则，“大熊”机器拖拉机站和它所服务的集体农场也一样遵守，一九五一年它把集体农场派来的三十四人培养成了拖拉机手。
    据马留达站长说，“大熊”机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手和联合收割机手都是优秀的工作人员。我们从这个站的社会主义竞赛成绩公布牌上看出这种情形。例如，第七拖拉机队在五月中旬以十二·九辆拖拉机（以平均每辆十五匹马力计算）耕了三百零五公顷，节约了燃料五百六十三公斤。我们也从这个站的拖拉机手的报酬上看出这种情形。本来一个履带拖拉机手完成一天的定额时，可以从机器拖拉机站得到二十五卢布，从集体农场得到一普特谷物的报酬；如果他在完成定额时还节约了燃料，那么还可以得到他所节约的燃料的价值的一半。“大熊”机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手百分之八十是超额完成任务的，他们一天平均从站上得到四十卢布，从集体农场得到一个半普特谷物的报酬。
    我们和这个站的第十一拖拉机队的拖拉机手克拉斯尼茨基谈了话。他当拖拉机手已经二十一年了。他和他的妻子、大女儿都是“到共产主义之路”集体农场成员。他在一九五一年驾驶“дT——54”式拖拉机，耕了八百八十三公顷熟地（所有农作都折成耕熟地工作），完成了一百六十个定额，得到了八百个劳动日，每劳动日从机器拖拉机站领取了五个卢布的报酬，从“到共产主义之路”集体农场领取了三公斤小麦和三卢布三十四戈比的报酬。同时，由于节约了六百三十公斤燃料，他得到了燃料价值的一半；由于修理拖拉机时节约了材料，他得到了八百卢布的奖金。同时，他因为工龄长，领取了等于全年八百个劳动日的百分之十的年金；因为是一级拖拉机手，还领取了等于全年八百个劳动日的百分之十的收入。此外，去年冬天，他在附近一所机械学校教了一个半月课，领到了一千三百五十卢布工资。去年，在集体农场养蚕生产队工作的他的妻子和在蔬菜生产队工作的他的女儿，都得到许多劳动日。他还有一个十三岁的儿子和一个十一岁的女儿在小学四年级和三年级免费念书。在苏联，拖拉机手的培养是受到鼓励的，他们的报酬较高，他们的生活很富裕。
    机器拖拉机站，这是国家用以发展集体化、机械化的农业大生产的企业，这是国家用以巩固工农联盟的纽带。“大熊”机器拖拉机站替我们作出了这样的结论。
