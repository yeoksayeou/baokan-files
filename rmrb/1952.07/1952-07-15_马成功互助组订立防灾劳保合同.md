    Ma Chenggong Mutual Aid Team Establishes Disaster Prevention and Labor Insurance Contract
    Editor: The Ma Chenggong Mutual Aid Team in Xiangjing Village, Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, is a temporary work exchange mutual aid team composed of nine farming households with several years of history. However, people say that this mutual aid team is "a group that disbands after hoeing wheat and harvesting wheat, with each family bearing the burden of hail-damaged seedlings." It turns out that every year during the wheat harvesting and seedling hoeing stages, especially in the face of emergency situations such as wind and hail disasters, the team members are afraid of their own land being neglected and want to work for themselves first. At this time, they each work independently and do not help each other!
    This year, after studying Comrade Gao Gang's report, everyone conducted an inspection of the mutual aid team. They found that two households in the team were still being exploited by usury, and one household wanted to withdraw from the team because they were not getting the benefits of mutual aid. The team members felt that if this continued, the mutual aid team was in danger of collapsing. Later, they studied the experience of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative and decided to rectify the mutual aid team. After a long discussion, they created a "Disaster Prevention and Labor Insurance Contract" with the principle of "everyone shares the burden when one family has a problem." The specific methods are: (1) Disaster Prevention: The entire team is responsible if one family suffers a disaster. For example, if a disaster causes a loss of one *shi* of grain (approximately 50kg), and the team's total output is ten *shi* of grain, then it is divided into ten shares, with each *shi* of output bearing the loss of one *dou* (approximately 5kg), and the affected household also shares one share.
    (2) Labor Insurance: If a laborer becomes ill during labor, the entire team is responsible for helping to cultivate the land. For helping work within two months, the patient will repay the labor or pay wages within one year after recovery; for helping work beyond two months, the entire team will share the burden according to the labor force (the person themselves also bears one share), without the need to repay labor. The area of land cultivated by the helping labor is based on the average cultivated area per laborer in the entire team, and any excess must be repaid with labor or paid wages.
    With the signing of this contract, the Ma Chenggong Mutual Aid Team immediately saw a new atmosphere of concerted effort, collective labor, and unified implementation of production plans. Now the entire team has formulated a patriotic production increase plan, with an average increase of fifty *jin* (approximately 25kg) of grain per *mu* (approximately 0.067 hectares). The mutual aid team has also changed from a temporary work exchange team to a permanent team. This method has attracted the attention of the entire village, and six temporary work exchange teams in the village have become permanent teams. Twenty-three other mutual aid teams have also launched a production increase challenge and competition against the Ma Chenggong Mutual Aid Team.

### 马成功互助组订立防灾劳保合同

    马成功互助组订立防灾劳保合同
    编辑同志：山西潞城县祥井村的马成功互助组，是由九户农民组成的已有好几年历史的拨工互助组。可是人们说，这个互助组是“锄麦割麦组拆散、雹打荒苗一家担”。原来每年到割麦、锄苗阶段，特别是在遭遇到一些风雹灾害的紧急关头，组员们谁也怕荒了自己的地，都想给自己先干，这时就各干各，不互助了！
    今年大家学了高岗同志的报告，对互助组进行了检查。他们发现组内有两户还受着高利贷的剥削，有一户因为得不到互助的好处而想退组。组员们都感到这样下去，互助组有垮台的危险。后来他们又学习了郭玉恩农业生产合作社的经验，决心整顿互助组。他们讨论了很久，订出一个“一家有事大家担”的“防止灾害侵袭和劳动保险合同”。具体的办法是：（一）防灾。一家受灾，全组负担。如受灾损失一石粮，而全组实产十石粮，就分成十份，每石产量负担损失一斗，受灾户本人也分担一份。
    （二）劳动保险。如某劳动力在劳动过程中生了病，全组就负责帮工把地种好。两个月以内的帮工，由病人病好后在一年内还工或付工资；两个月以上的帮工，由全组按劳力共同分担（本人也负担一份），不必还工。帮工耕的地以全组每个劳力的平均耕地数为标准，超过数需还工或付工资。
    订了这个合同，马成功互助组立时出现了同心协力集体劳动、统一实行生产计划的新景气。现在全组订出了爱国增产计划，平均每亩要增产五十斤粮。互助组也由临时拨工组变成常年组了。这个办法引起了全村的注意，村内已有六个拨工组变成常年组，还有二十三个互助组向马成功互助组展开了增产挑战应战竞赛。    江潾秀  盖秦富
