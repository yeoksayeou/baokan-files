    Chairman Mao's Writings on the Tianshan Grassland

    After the publication of the Kazakh edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as a separate volume, it was enthusiastically welcomed by Kazakh herders in the Bai Yang Gou pastoral area of the Tianshan Mountains. The Kazakh edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" includes Chairman Mao's early works:
    "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Pay Attention to Economic Work,"
    "Our Economic Policy," and "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work."

    When I visited Bai Yang Gou on the evening of June 14th, I encountered more than twenty Kazakh men and women sitting on the grassland. They were quietly listening to Mu Haiyi, the head of the reading group and a primary school teacher, reading aloud Chairman Mao's "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," which he delivered in January 1934. They expressed their heartfelt respect and love for Chairman Mao's writings and his profound and vivid expositions. The herders said that for more than thirty years, Chairman Mao has been thinking of ways for the people and worrying about the people. After reading "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," the herders held a discussion. They unanimously praised the cadres of the People's Government. Everyone said that Chairman Mao's cadres are always concerned about the interests of the people, citing the example of Guo Zhen, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Dihua Southern District Committee. He often went to the herders' tents to cordially inquire about various issues in their production and lives, and to discuss ways to develop animal husbandry. Bao Lukeya, the representative of the township women, quoted Chairman Mao's words, "The masses of women want to learn to plow and harrow, who should teach them?" She said, "In the past, Kazakh women in this area had never participated in agricultural production, but under Chairman Mao's education, they all participated in the canal construction project this year. When the mutual aid teams had difficulties with transportation, the women participated in carrying manure and applying fertilizer. Because women participated in labor production, their status in the family has also been greatly improved." After a heated discussion, they came to a conclusion: "Following Chairman Mao means victory."

    The next day, I visited the herders in six more tents. They enthusiastically told me that they had also read Chairman Mao's "Pay Attention to Economic Work," which was published in August 1933, and "Our Economic Policy," which was published in January 1934. They spoke of Chairman Mao's articles and his wise leadership, and were very excited when they thought of their happy lives after liberation. In the past, they were all poor herders. In 1950, under the leadership of the People's Government, in addition to animal husbandry, they began to cultivate some land. In 1951, they organized production mutual aid teams to help each other graze cattle and sheep, in order to free up manpower and expand the cultivated area. This year, they basically solved the problem of food for the whole year. After liberation, the prices of local products in the pastoral areas have also increased three to five times compared with before liberation. The unsalable wool and sheep intestines have been opened up for sales. In less than three years after liberation, their livestock has increased three or four times. The most prominent increase was that of Hasen, the model of animal husbandry production in Dihua County and the leader of the mutual aid team. In 1949, he had only one horse and twelve sheep, but now he has fifty-eight sheep, two cattle, and two horses. When Hasen recalled his past painful life, he said, "For two whole years, the whole family had never drunk tea, because exchanging a brick of tea required giving up a sheep." Now, the lives of the Kazakh herders have changed greatly. This year, almost every family, men and women, have sewn themselves new clothes. Sixty-eight-year-old herder Si Hakejiang said, "Before liberation, the cloth exchanged for a sheep was not enough to make a suit of clothes. This year, I only sold one sheep, and the whole family of six wore a new suit of clothes." Ha Se Mubai said, "Before liberation, the house I lived in was three wooden sticks and a piece of broken felt. This year, I made a 'Kazakh enclosure'."

    The herders said that after reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," their hearts were brightened, and they understood why they had such a happy life. They all requested that the reading group read more of Chairman Mao's writings. According to the herders' requests, the reading group decided to universally read and explain "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" once in the other one hundred and thirty-six tents within a month.

    A Shining Example of Implementing National Policies – Introducing the Soviet Novel "Alitet Goes to the Mountains"
    By Shi Yunzi
    The Soviet Novel "Alitet Goes to the Mountains" by Tikhon Syomushkin, translated by Yang Liping, published by East China People's Publishing House

    "Alitet Goes to the Mountains" is a very good Soviet novel. This novel depicts the historical process of how a Soviet minority nationality (the Chukchi, who live in the Chukchi Peninsula in the northeastern corner of the Soviet Union), which had long suffered from imperialist aggression, economic backwardness, and cultural isolation, gained liberation. The author tells the reader with rich emotion: After the October Revolution, under the leadership and assistance of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, how the Chukchi people expelled the forces of American imperialism and cleared out the internal enemies of the nation; and on the basis of national unity, how the Chukchi people carried out a series of political, economic, and cultural constructions, thereby achieving the complete liberation of the entire nation.

    From this novel, readers can deeply and specifically understand the spiritual essence of Marxist-Leninist national policies. In particular, it has a very important practical educational significance for our Chinese comrades who work in minority areas. This novel vividly tells us: What kind of political principles should be mastered to do a good job in minority areas? What attitude should be taken to solve the difficulties encountered in work? What kind of methods should be adopted in minority work that are correct?

    This novel does not use any dogma to teach the reader, but uses vivid facts to speak. The author uses vivid characters and facts to subtly explain national issues and the complexity and difficulty of solving them. And every question it raises is often encountered or may be encountered in our work in minority areas in China.

    Anyone who works in a minority area will first find it difficult to not understand the local language and writing. Soviet government workers who went to the Chukchi Peninsula in the Soviet Union to develop work understood this. Zhukov, the first to arrive on the peninsula, prepared before departure. He painstakingly studied the Chukchi language and initially learned everyday conversation. Later, he humbly learned from every Chukchi hunter and herder. As a result, Zhukov finally became a worker who could freely use the Chukchi language and gained the love of the local people. Ross, who arrived later, attached even greater importance to this issue. He learned from Zhukov and from the masses. "Ross diligently studied the Chukchi language, all day and sometimes all night. ... Ross rearranged the new words and idioms according to his own new classification method, rewriting the entire notebook for this purpose. Now, he had two books: one, he wrote the new words in alphabetical order; the other, he recorded idioms for conversation with special headings, such as: 'General Conversation,' 'Commercial Conversation,' 'Conversation about Dogs,' and a large number of idioms to be used on various other occasions." In this way, Ross compiled six sets of "Vocabulary and Idiom Copybooks" to help with the work. Later, he gave these copybooks to new colleagues to help them learn. Ross regarded learning the national language as one of the most urgent tasks. He ordered the instructors to concentrate on learning Chukchi within two months. Through such hard study, the language barrier gradually disappeared, and they used this to closely connect with the masses and carry out activities to organize and educate the people.

    The Soviet government's assistance to ethnic minorities was not just empty words. It helped the Chukchi people reform their backward lives in various ways. The Soviet government sent political workers, medical workers, educational workers, trade workers, radio technicians, and geological experts to the Chukchi Peninsula. It helped the hunters and herders establish their own regime—the Soviet, establish trade stations, open schools, hospitals, and cultural service stations, sent machine whaling ships, and sent large quantities of building materials. These things enabled a backward nation that had long been in a primitive hunting and fishing society to begin a modern, scientific, and cultured happy life. Soviet government workers enthusiastically helped the Chukchi cultivate a group of cadres from their own nationality. They selected Aai from the hunters and herders, sent him to the province and Moscow to study culture and technology, and made him a captain who could master the motor. Under the education of the Bolsheviks, poor herders such as Vamko became prestigious leaders in the tribe. At the same time, they also cultivated female cadres: trained Mary to be a midwife, made Vicki participate in revolutionary work, and rescued Teglena from the hands of bullies to study nursing work. Many such male and female hunters and herders got rid of the humble fate of being oppressed and insulted and became leaders of the new society. Some of them even joined the Communist Party.

    The only reliance of personnel working in minority areas is the wisdom and strength of the masses. If anyone is not good at implementing the mass line, it is impossible for them to do a good job; if anyone does not understand and respect the thoughts, feelings, customs, and habits of the local masses, they will easily run into trouble in many things and end up separating from the masses. Soviet government workers on the Chukchi Peninsula were conducting mass work in minority areas everywhere in accordance with the principles of Lenin and Stalin. They—Ross, Zhukov, etc.—were very concerned about the living conditions of every Chukchi person. When they saw that Yalac's lover was about to give birth, they sent her to the hospital, and the leaders personally visited her. When they found that the couple's house lacked utensils, they sent wardrobes, chairs, and eating utensils from the trade station warehouse. In this way, government workers cared about every Chukchi person's eating, clothing, housing, and marriage problems. They cared about the people more than they cared about their own lives. In this way, the masses ran over and closely relied on the Soviets.

    In this novel, there are many places that specifically describe the valuable experience of carrying out mass work in minority areas. One is the issue of the attitude towards the customs and habits of the local people. When clearing the dead dog, the teacher De Wo Jin advocated throwing the dead dog into the ice crevice by the sea. The herdsman Vamko said: "No, we must never do this, it will be bad to do so. We may offend the vicious elves, and the sea beasts will not come to our shore." He advocated dragging the dead dog to the moss area. The teacher agreed. When the hunters caught a big whale, the radio operator Molodeztsov wanted to take a picture of the whale, but the old hunter Leok stopped him and said: "Can't do this!" "Once I caught a whale, and an American did this, and then I didn't see a whale for three years." The leader of the peninsula, Ross, supported the old man and did not allow the photo to be taken. These things made the hunters very satisfied. Another issue is to carry out work according to the actual requirements and awareness level of the local masses, which is the pragmatic working method. Female cadre Natasha gave a speech on promoting "equality between men and women." Afterwards, Zhukov criticized her, believing that although her speech might be excellent in Russia, it "just said a lot of words without considering the local life and habits" on this peninsula. In this regard, Ross took a different approach. He always made full preparations before each speech. He never talked too much. He focused the content of what he wanted to say on the production that the local people cared about - "hunting walruses" and other major issues, because these things are in line with the requirements and cognitive abilities of the Chukchi people. When Ross inspected the trade station, he saw that the "dead price list" was posted in the field, and no hunter could understand it. Therefore, the trade work could not be carried out for a long time. Ross created a "live price list": he put eighty bricks of tea (each worth one ruble) on two white fox skins (each white fox skin worth forty rubles); or he put two white fox skins on a hunting gun. In this way, illiterate hunters also understood the exchange price. A large number of hunters received reasonable exchanges, and their lives were greatly improved.

    When carrying out social reforms, Ross and other comrades did not take a rash approach. The Chukchi people have a special custom: sick elderly people can ask their children to strangle them, so that they can
    "Ascend to heaven early." Once, the old man Anka Tagan was also going to enter "heaven," Ross rushed over, rescued the old man from the noose with a humane attitude, and then changed the old man's name to meet the local people's requirements of "escaping the eyes of the elves." In this way, under the circumstances of not violating local customs, an old hunter who was almost strangled by superstition was cleverly rescued. When the people were not yet awakened, Zhukov proposed "immediately organizing the National Soviet," and Ross insisted on "looking carefully before jumping." He said that the main thing is to be familiar with the people, let the masses have the opportunity to talk about this matter, and understand this matter. Later facts proved that such steady progress was right. If you want to use a hasty method to "breakthrough successfully" on this type of issue, it will fail.

    When the masses realized that "Russian whites are not bad people" and had a preliminary understanding of the motherland, their potential enthusiasm and creativity were brought into play. At this time, the leaders must be encouraged and supported well. The hunter Yalac, who was in charge of the fur warehouse, and the trade station manager Zohov disagreed. Zohov relied on the old to sell the old and wanted to pack and store the fur that had not been scraped clean of grease; Yalac knew that doing so would cause the white fur to become moldy and discolored during the long voyage, and he resolutely opposed it. Ross supported Yalac's correct opinion and replaced the incompetent Zohov. There is no leadership that can win the support of the people more than such leadership.

    In complex struggles and work, Soviet workers demonstrated superior working styles. The Soviet workers on the Chukchi Peninsula showed in every matter and every position that they did not come to the peninsula as tourists, but to work. They were very determined to overcome difficulties. Ross often thought to himself that he would never leave the place unless he completely "changed the face of life" there. This was almost the thought and determination of every worker. Another trade station manager, Rusakov, did not admit that he was a simple businessman. When he exchanged goods for fur, he always considered the ways and methods of establishing the Soviet system in the mountains. Primary school teacher De Woshe went to help the local tribal women hunt walruses in his spare time, did a lot of heavy work, but did not want any reward. He helped the women establish a complete fishing and hunting labor group, taught them "setting traps to catch beasts," and guided them to participate in labor production like men.

    Transforming a backward nation is not an easy task. It is impossible to imagine that a single order can make the entire peninsula look brand new. There are unity, struggle, propaganda and organization work, and a series of unfamiliar questions waiting to be solved one by one. The comrades working on the Chukchi Peninsula studied every person on the peninsula and adopted different attitudes towards different objects. On the issue of uniting all forces that can be united, the novel tells an extremely moving story. Leok of the Anmakai tribe is the most experienced old hunter of marine animals within the Chukchi nationality. However, he is very stubborn and refuses to accept new things. He is unwilling to join the labor group, and he maintains contact with the bully Alitet. Some comrades expressed that there was no way to deal with such an old man, but the leader Ross said: Don't worry, "use facts to influence them," "If you want to win him over, you have to show him real goods." Facts proved that Ross was right. Leok once used the "Russian matches" that would not burn to ridicule the Soviet regime, stubbornly believing that "American matches are good." However, later the Soviet helped the hunters of the labor group use motor whaling ships to capture a large number of walruses, and even the women's labor group captured twenty-five walruses at once; but Leok could not capture that many. He could only capture a very small number of walruses with his skin boat propelled by manpower. He was persuaded by "facts" and finally awakened. He confessed the process of his awakening to Ross and said: "The motor - this is really an important thing! You can't make a motor yourself. I thought a lot, thought for a long time, and then I decided to join the labor group. Such an excellent hunter of mine was left behind by ordinary hunters, left behind by the women of Anmakai! The motor defeated me, oh, it defeated me so badly! I don't want to continue to be ridiculed, so I joined the labor group." Once this old hunter was won over, his potential was contributed to the masses: he put forward new fishing and hunting methods, gave full play to his specialties, led the masses, and caught a big whale. Finally, he broke off relations with the bully Alitet and became a Bolshevik.

    In the process of fighting against evil forces, Soviet workers are particularly cautious and resolute. Ross and his comrades understood that the masses' awareness had not reached the level it should have, and they would never act lightly. Alitet is a scoundrel in the Chukchi nationality and a thief of the people. After the establishment of the Soviet, he tried every means to collude with the Americans to undermine the new regime and harm revolutionary workers. His father, Kolawji, is a vicious yellow religious, and also a criminal who defrauds the people. Such national sinners are already guilty of heinous crimes and deserve to die. However, the Chukchi people did not fully understand their crimes and still treated them with tolerance. In this way, the Soviet workers waited. They adopted an isolation policy towards Alitet. When the regime was consolidated and the masses' political understanding was improved, the masses were allowed to judge Alitet themselves at a public trial, and a resolution was passed to expel this public enemy of the nation.

    The experience of the Chukchi Peninsula illustrates a basic principle: to solve the national problem, it is necessary to go through the stage of opposing imperialism and the internal enemies of the people, while also opposing great nationalism and narrow nationalism. The Soviet regime of the Chukchi eliminated the economic base and political influence of American merchants and spies, and at the same time used appropriate methods to overthrow the national sinner Alitet. Both of these things were carried out by organizing the masses. The Soviet leaders did not rely solely on administrative orders to deal with these issues, but went through a period of "factual competition." For example, the Soviet trade stations used fair and reasonable prices to purchase seafood and fur, which exposed the cruel plunder of American merchants, so that the people no longer trusted American merchants, and the invaders had to roll out of the peninsula. In backward areas, "whites" easily expose a "sense of national superiority." Zohov, the manager of the Soviet trade station in the Loren tribe (a half-baked "expert" from a business background), once told the hunters: "You can live without schools and hospitals," but you can't do without him and his goods. He believed that the Chukchi hunters were "ignorant people" and that "they should listen to us Russians and learn from us." This great nationalist could only be transferred back to the mainland later with "untapped talents." Opposing narrow nationalism is a long-term and arduous task. The Chukchi people have a national prejudice of "not trusting any white people" due to long-term deception by imperialist elements. The Soviet workers did not force the immediate elimination of this prejudice, but believed that slowly educating with facts would certainly achieve the goal of unity and friendship. In this regard, they did a lot of inconspicuous work: they faithfully served the new lives of the Chukchi people, such as the aforementioned caring about their lives, helping them improve productivity, and improving their living conditions. The eyes of the people are discerning. They finally stopped looking for suspicion in the difference in skin color and appearance, and finally realized that "they are our best friends," "not all white people are bad people," and finally united harmoniously around the Soviet system regardless of race.

    In this way, through complex and arduous work, through close contact with the masses and pragmatic work, the face of the Chukchi Peninsula changed. The Chukchi people praised the leaders of the Soviet regime. They told Ross from the bottom of their hearts: "Ross, you are the first white man to be called a real person by all of us. In the first winter you came here, the trade completely changed. People here now drink tea with sugar, and many people have rifles they didn't have before, and nets they didn't take out with them before. Everywhere people are saying: that 'man with a big beard' cherishes our foxes and stipulates that they are worth a lot of goods. Everyone says that you are like a good yellow religious, a merciful yellow religious, and you are helping our lives. This is what the people along the coast are saying."

    These are the concrete practices of Marxism-Leninism on the national question. The victorious experience of the Soviet Chukchi Peninsula in implementing national policies is worth learning from.

    毛主席的著作在天山草原
    新华社记者  杨克现
    “毛泽东选集”哈萨克文单行本出版后，受到天山白杨沟游牧区哈萨克牧民的热烈欢迎。哈萨克文的“毛泽东选集”单行本，包括毛主席早期作品
    “中国社会各阶级的分析”、“必须注意经济工作”、
    “我们的经济政策”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”等四篇文章。
    记者在六月十四日傍晚访问白杨沟时，正碰见二十多个哈萨克族男女围坐在草地上。他们正在静听读报组组长、小学教员穆海矣朗读毛主席在一九三四年一月所发表的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”。他们对于毛主席的著作和他的深刻生动的论述，表示衷心的崇敬和爱戴。牧民们说，三十多年来，毛主席一直为人民想办法，为人民操心。当读完“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”后，牧民们就进行讨论。他们一致赞扬人民政府的干部，大家说，毛主席的干部随时都关心人民的利益；并举出中国共产党迪化南山区委会书记郭震的例子。他常常到牧民的帐篷里，亲切地询问牧民们的生产和生活中的各种问题，商量发展牧畜的办法。乡妇女代表苞露克亚引证毛主席“妇女群众要学习犁耙，找什么人去教她们呢？”的话说：“这一带的哈萨克族妇女，过去从来就没有参加过农业生产，可是在毛主席的教育下，今年全部参加了修渠工程。互助组的运输有困难，妇女就参加背粪施肥等工作。由于妇女参加劳动生产，她们在家庭中的地位也大大地提高了。”经过热烈的讨论，他们就得到一个结论：“跟着毛主席走就是胜利。”
    第二天，记者又访问了六个牧民帐篷的牧民。他们热情地告诉我：他们还读过毛主席在一九三三年八月所发表的“必须注意经济工作”和在一九三四年一月所发表的“我们的经济政策”两篇文章。他们谈到毛主席的文章和他的英明领导，同时想到解放后他们的幸福生活时，就十分激动。他们过去都是贫苦的牧民。一九五零年在人民政府的领导下，除畜牧外开始兼种了一些土地；一九五一年又组织了生产互助组，互助牧放牛羊，以便腾出人力，扩大耕地面积。这一年，他们基本上解决了全年的食粮问题。解放后牧区的土产价格较解放前也提高了三倍至五倍；滞销的羊毛、羊肠已经打开了销路。他们在解放后不到三年间，牧畜增加了三四倍。其中增加最突出的是迪化县畜牧生产模范、互助组组长哈森，他在一九四九年还只有一匹马和十二只羊，现在他已有五十八只羊，两头牛和两匹马了。哈森在回忆他过去的痛苦生活时说：“整整两年，全家人没有喝过茶，因为买一块砖茶要换去一只羊。”现在，哈萨克族牧民的生活大大地变了样。今年，他们几乎家家男女都缝了一身新衣服。六十八岁的老牧民斯哈可江说：“解放前用一个羊换来的布，还不够做一身衣服。今年只卖了一只羊，全家大小六口人都穿上一套新衣服了。”哈色木拜说：“解放前，我住的房子是三根木棍一片破毡，今年制了一顶‘哈萨克围’了。”
    牧民们说，读了“毛泽东选集”以后，心里就亮了，懂得了我们为什么会得到这种幸福的生活。他们都要求读报组能多读毛主席的著作。读报组根据牧民们的要求，决定在一个月内在其他一百三十六顶帐篷中普遍读讲一次“毛泽东选集”。实施民族政策的光辉范例——介绍苏联小说“阿里泰到山里去”石云子苏联吉洪·塞摩希金著杨立平译华东人民出版社出版
    “阿里泰到山里去”是一部很好的苏联小说。这部小说，描写了一个长期遭受帝国主义侵略、经济落后、文化闭塞的苏联少数民族（朱基族，聚居在苏联东北角朱可兹克半岛上），怎样获得解放的历史过程。作者以丰富的情感告诉读者：十月革命后，朱基族在布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府领导和帮助下，怎样驱逐了美帝国主义势力，清除了民族内部的公敌；在民族团结的基础上，朱基族人民又是怎样地进行了一系列的政治、经济、文化的建设，从而获得了整个民族的彻底解放。
    从这部小说里读者能够深刻地、具体地认识马克思列宁主义民族政策的精神实质。特别是，对于我们中国在少数民族地区工作的同志，更具有非常重要的实际教育意义。这部小说生动地告诉了我们：在少数民族地区工作，要掌握什么样的政治原则才能做好工作？工作中遇到困难应该用什么样的态度才能解决？少数民族工作应该采取什么样的方法才是正确的？
    这本小说不是搬弄什么教条来教训读者，它是拿生动的事实来说话的。作者运用了鲜明生动的人物和事实，细腻地说明了民族问题，说明了解决民族问题的复杂性和艰巨性。而它提出来的每一个问题，在我们中国少数民族地区的工作中也是常常遇到或者是可能遇到的。
    在少数民族地区工作，谁都会首先感到棘手的，是不懂当地的文字和语言。到苏联朱可兹克半岛去开辟工作的苏联政府工作人员懂得这一点。第一个到达半岛的朱可夫，在出发以前就做了准备。他苦心地钻研了朱基语，初步学习了日常会话，以后，他又虚心地向每一个朱基族的猎民和牧民学习。结果，朱可夫终于成为能够自由运用朱基语的工作人员，获得当地人民的爱戴。后到的罗斯，更是十分重视这个问题。他向朱可夫学习，向群众学习，“罗斯辛勤地研究朱基语言，整天地，有时是通宵地研究着。……罗斯按照自己的、新的分类方法，把生字和成语重新排列起来，为了这个目的，把整个笔记本重写一次。现在，他有两本：一本，他按照字母的次序把生字写下来；另一本，他用特别的标题，录下会话用的成语，譬如：‘一般会话’、‘商业会话’、‘谈狗的会话’，和许多在另外各种场合下要用的大量成语。”这样，罗斯编写了六套“生字和成语抄本”，来帮助工作。后来他又把这些抄本送给新来的工作同志，帮助他们学习。罗斯把学好民族语言看成最紧要的工作之一，他曾命令指导员要在两个月内专心学会朱基话。经过如此艰苦的学习，语言的隔阂逐渐消除了，他们借此密切地联系群众，展开组织人民、教育人民的活动。
    苏联政府对少数民族的帮助不是一句漂亮的空话。它从各方面去帮助朱基族人民改革落后的生活。苏联政府给朱可兹克半岛派去了政治工作人员、医药工作人员、教育工作人员、贸易工作人员、无线电技术员和地质学专家。帮助猎民和牧民建立起自己的政权——苏维埃，建立起贸易场，开办了学校、医院、文化服务站，送去了机器捕鲸船，送去了大批房屋建筑材料。这些，使一个长期处在原始渔猎社会的落后民族开始了现代化的、科学的、有文化的幸福生活。苏联政府工作人员十分热情地帮助朱基族培养了一批本民族的干部。他们从猎民和牧民中选拔了阿艾，把他送往省里和莫斯科去学习文化和技术，把他造成为一个能够掌握马达的船长。在布尔什维克的教育下，贫苦牧人瓦姆科等，变成了部落中有威望的领导者。同时，他们还培养了妇女干部：把玛丽训练成助产士，使薇凯参加革命工作，把泰格莲娜从恶霸手里抢救出来，学习看护工作。很多这样的男女猎民和牧民，摆脱了被压迫被侮辱的卑贱命运，成为新社会的领导人物，有些人还加入了共产党。
    在少数民族地区工作的人员唯一的依靠是群众的智慧和力量。如果谁不善于贯彻群众路线，谁就不可能把工作做好；谁不了解和尊重当地群众的思想感情与风俗习惯，就很容易在许多事情上碰得头破血流，结果脱离了群众。在朱可兹克半岛上的苏联政府工作人员是处处按照列宁和斯大林的原则进行少数民族群众工作的。他们——罗斯、朱可夫等，是十分关怀每一个朱基人的生活情况。他们看到雅拉克的爱人要生育小孩了，就把她送进医院去，领导者并且亲自去探望她。他们发现这对夫妇屋子里缺乏用具，就从贸易场仓库里把衣橱、椅子和食用器具送过去。就是这样，政府的工作人员关心着每一个朱基人的吃饭、穿衣、住屋和婚姻问题。他们关心人民，比关心自己的生活还显得重要。就是这样，群众跑过来了，紧密地靠拢苏维埃了。
    在这部小说里，有很多地方具体地描写了在少数民族地区进行群众工作的宝贵经验。一个是对待当地人民风俗习惯的态度问题。在清除死狗的时候，教师德窝金主张把死狗丢到海边的冰隙里去，牧民瓦姆科说：“不，我们万万不能这样做，这样做会不好的。我们也许会触怒了恶毒的精灵，海兽就不到我们岸边来了。”他主张把死狗拖到苔藓地区去。教师就同意了。当猎民打到了一条大鲸鱼，无线电员莫洛得左夫要给鲸鱼摄影，老猎人莱鄂克阻止他，说：“不能这样做！”“有一次我打到一条鲸鱼，有一个美国人像这样做过，后来我就三年看不到一条鲸鱼。”半岛的领导者罗斯就支持这老人，不让照相。这些事情使猎民异常满意。另一个问题，是根据当地群众的实际要求和觉悟水平去进行工作，也就是实事求是的工作方法问题。妇女干部娜塔莎，作了一次关于宣传“男女平等”的演讲，事后，朱可夫给她批评，认为她的演说虽然在俄罗斯可能是很出色的，但是在这半岛上却“只是说了很多话，没有考虑到当地的生活和习惯。”在这一点上，罗斯便采取了不同的方式，他的每一次讲话，事先总是作了充分的准备。他从不夸夸其谈，他把要说的内容重点放在当地人民所关心的生产——“打海象”一类主要的问题上，因为这些事情才是符合朱基人的要求和认识能力的。罗斯在巡视贸易场的时候，看到场里贴着“死的价目单”，没有一个猎人看得懂，因此贸易工作长久不能开展。罗斯就创造了“活的价目单”：拿八十块砖茶（每块值
    一个卢布）放在两张白狐皮上面（每张白狐皮值四十卢布）；或在一枝猎枪上也放上两张白狐皮。这样，不识字的猎民也都明白交换的价目了。大批的猎人得到了合理的交换，生活大大改善了。
    在进行社会改革的时候，罗斯和其他的同志们是不采取轻率的方式的。朱基人有一个特殊的风俗：患病的老人可以请求自己的子弟把他绞死，以便
    “早登天国”。有一次老人安卡他甘也要进“天国”，罗斯赶来了，用富于人情味的态度把老人从绞索下抢救出来，然后顺应当地人“逃避精灵眼睛”的要求，给这老人改个名字。这样，在不违反当地风俗的情形下，巧妙地救活了一个被迷信几乎扼死的老猎民。当人民还没有觉悟起来的时候，朱可夫曾提出“马上动手组织民族苏维埃”，罗斯坚持“看好了再跳”。他说，主要的得和人民熟悉，让群众有机会谈谈这件事，并且懂得这件事。后来的事实证明这样稳步地前进是对的。在这类问题上如果想用急躁办法“突击成功”，是会失败的。
    当群众觉悟到“俄罗斯白人不是坏人”，对祖国有了初步的认识以后，他们潜在的积极性和创造力就被发扬起来了。这个时候，领导者必须很好地加以鼓励与支持。看管毛皮仓库的猎人雅拉克和贸易场经理左霍夫意见不合。左霍夫倚老卖老，要把没有刮尽油脂的毛皮打包储藏；雅拉克知道这样做会使洁白的毛皮在长途航行中发霉变色，他坚决反对。罗斯支持了雅拉克正确的意见，把不称职的左霍夫撤换下来。没有比这样的领导更能获得人民的拥护了。
    在复杂的斗争与工作中，苏维埃工作人员表现了优越的工作作风。朱可兹克半岛的苏维埃工作人员，在任何一件事情、一个岗位上，都表现了不是到半岛上来做游客的，而是来做工作的，他们克服困难的决心很大。罗斯自己常常想，他要是不把那地方的“生活面貌，完全改变一新，决不离开”。这几乎是每一个工作员的思想和决心。另一贸易场经理卢萨科夫，他不承认自己是一个简简单单的商人，当他用货物交换毛皮的时候，他总是考虑着在山里建立苏维埃制度的方式和方法。小学教师德窝舍，在工作之余就去帮助当地部落的妇女们打海象，做了许多繁重的工作，却不要任何一点报酬。他帮助妇女们建立了一个完善的渔猎劳动组，教会她们“设阱捕兽”，引导她们和男子一样参加了劳动生产。
    改造一个落后民族，不是一件轻而易举的事情，不可能设想一纸命令可以使半岛整个面貌焕然一新。这里有团结，有斗争，有宣传和组织工作，有一系列的陌生问题等待逐一解决。朱可兹克半岛的工作同志研究了半岛的每一人物，对不同的对象，采取了不同的态度。在团结一切可能团结的力量的问题上，小说里叙述了一个极为动人的故事。安马凯部落的莱鄂克，是朱基民族内渔猎海兽最有经验的老猎人。然而他很顽固，拒绝接受新鲜事物。他不肯参加劳动组，他和恶霸阿里泰保持着联系。对于这样的老头，有些同志表示没有办法，可是领导者罗斯说：别着急，“用事实去影响他们”，“你要赢得他，就得拿出真货色来给他看。”事实证明罗斯是对的。莱鄂克曾经用不会燃烧的“俄罗斯火柴”来讥讽苏维埃政权，固执地认定“美国火柴好”。可是，后来苏维埃帮助劳动组的猎人们使用了马达捕鲸船，捕获了大批海象，连妇女劳动组也一次捕获了二十五只海象；而莱鄂克却捕不到这么多。他依靠人力划桨的皮船，只能捕得极少数的海象。他被“事实”说服了，终于觉醒过来，他向罗斯坦白了他觉悟的过程说：“马达——这才真是一件重要的东西！你自己总不能够做出一部马达。我想了很多，想了很久，后来我决定参加劳动组。我这样一个出色的猎人被普通的猎人丢在后面，被安马凯的女人们丢在后面！马达打败了我，噢，它把我打败得多惨！我不愿意继续被人嘲弄，所以，我参加了劳动组。”这个老猎人一经被争取过来，他的潜在力就贡献给了群众：他提出了新的渔猎方法，发挥了自己的特长，带领群众，打获了一条大鲸鱼。最后，他和恶霸阿里泰断绝了关系，成为一个布尔什维克。
    在与恶势力斗争的过程中，苏维埃工作者是特别慎重与坚决的。罗斯和他的同志懂得群众觉悟还没有达到应有的高度，决不轻易动手。阿里泰是朱基族内的败类，是人民的盗贼，苏维埃成立之后，他曾千方百计地勾结美国人破坏新政权，暗害革命工作人员。他的父亲苛劳吉，是一个恶毒的黄教徒，也是欺诈人民的罪犯。这样的民族罪人，已是罪大恶极，死有余辜。但是朱基族人民没有完全了解他们的罪恶，还是用容忍的态度对待他们。这样，苏维埃工作者就等待着。对阿里泰采取孤立的政策。等到政权巩固了，群众的政治认识提高了，在一次公审大会上，让群众自己来审判阿里泰，通过了驱逐这个民族公敌的决议。
    朱可兹克半岛的经验，说明了一个基本原则，就是：解决民族问题，必须经过反对帝国主义和民族内部人民公敌的阶段，同时还要反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义。朱基族的苏维埃政权铲除了美国商人和特务的经济基础与政治影响，同时用适当的方法斗倒了民族罪人阿里泰，这两件事都是组织群众起来进行的。苏维埃领导者处理这些问题，并不单纯依赖行政命令，而是经过了一段“事实的竞争”过程。例如苏维埃贸易场用公平合理的价格收购海产和皮毛，就暴露了美国商人残酷的掠夺面目，使得人民不再信任美国商人，侵略者只好滚出半岛去。在落后地区的“白人”，很容易暴露“民族优越感”。罗伦部落苏维埃贸易场经理左霍夫（一个商人出身的一知半解的“专家”）曾向猎人们宣传说：“你们没有学校和医院也可以过下去”，可是没有他和他的货物就不行。他认定朱基族猎人都是些“蒙昧的人”，“他们应该听话，向我们俄罗斯人学习”。这个大民族主义者，后来也只有“怀才不遇”地被调回内地去了。反对狭隘民族主义，是一个长期的艰巨任务。朱基族人民由于长期遭受帝国主义分子的欺骗，有一种“不信任任何一个白人”的民族偏见。对于这个偏见，苏维埃工作者不强求立即加以消除，而是认为慢慢用事实进行教育，一定可以达到团结友爱的目的。在这方面，他们做了很多令人不注意的工作：他们忠心地为朱基人的新生活而服务，像上述关心他们的生活，帮助他们提高生产力，改善生活状况。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们终于不再在肤色的不同、相貌的差异上找怀疑，终于认识了“他们是我们最好的朋友”，“白人不是都是坏人”，终于不分种族，融洽地团结在苏维埃制度的周围了。
    就是这样，通过复杂而艰苦的工作，通过密切联系群众和实事求是的工作，朱可兹克半岛的面貌改变了。朱基族人民称颂苏维埃政权的领导者，他们向罗斯说出心眼里的话：“罗斯，你是第一个被我们大家称为一个真正的人的白人。在你到我们这里来的第一个冬天，买卖就完全变了样。我们这里的人现在喝茶放糖了，好多人有了他们以前没有的来福枪，有了他们以前出去没带过的捕兽网。到处人们都说：那个‘有大把胡子的’爱惜我们的狐狸，规定它们值很多货物。大家说，你好像一个好黄教徒，一个大慈大悲的黄教徒，你对我们的生活有帮助，这都是沿海岸人民说的话。”
    这些，就是马克思列宁主义在民族问题上的具体实践。苏联朱可兹克半岛实施民族政策的胜利经验，是值得我们学习的。
