    Beijing Advanced Production Experience Exhibition Opens Yesterday
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Advanced Production Experience Exhibition, sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, opened at the Working People's Cultural Palace on the 25th. More than 600 people attended the opening ceremony, including advanced producers from various factories and mines, as well as cadres and guests from various organizations and groups.
    The opening ceremony was presided over by Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Liu Laifu spoke first, saying that this exhibition clearly tells us four things: First, in order to victoriously complete the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, we must vigorously promote advanced experience. For example, the nodular cast iron of the Beijing Tram Repair and Manufacturing Plant, the rapid firing method of the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Huang Runping warehouse management method of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, and various advanced working methods in the construction industry have all played a significant role in improving work efficiency and accumulating national wealth. Second, many of the exhibits are the result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The nodular cast iron of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau and the Beijing Machine General Factory, and the pipe joint caulking of the Waterworks Company, are all learned from Soviet experience and have solved important problems in production. This shows that the advanced experience of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, is very valuable, and we must eliminate the bourgeois ideology of worshiping the United Kingdom and the United States and establish the idea of "leaning to one side" technically—learning from the Soviet Union. Third, in promoting advanced experience, we must break with conservative thinking. The emergence and promotion of any advanced production experience will encounter various ideological obstacles. We must strengthen education in the future so that the promotion of advanced experience can proceed smoothly. Fourth, in summarizing and promoting advanced experience, we must strengthen the combination of technical personnel and workers. This is also one of the biggest characteristics of this exhibition. The workers said: "Engineers have high theory, and workers have good experience. The combination of the two produces the key."
    Kang Yonghe, Director of the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Wu Han, Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, were invited to speak. In their speeches, they both emphasized that summarizing and promoting advanced experience is the main method of carrying out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, and it must be widely and thoroughly publicized; at the same time, summarizing and promoting advanced experience is a meticulous task, and it must be carried out in a more organized, led, and planned manner in the future.
    At the meeting, Liu Dezhen, a worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant and a national model worker, Li Shuhe, a worker at the Jingxi Mentougou Coal Mine and a national model worker, and Wang Zihou, an engineer at the Beijing Tram Company, spoke and specifically introduced their experiences in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    After the ceremony, advanced producers and guests from all aspects of the capital entered the exhibition hall in order. The "Beijing Advanced Production Experience Exhibition" was officially opened.

    北京先进生产经验展览会昨天开幕
    【本报讯】北京市总工会主办的先进生产经验展览会，二十五日在劳动人民文化宫举行开幕典礼。到会的有各厂矿企业中的先进生产者以及各机关团体的干部和来宾等六百多人。
    开幕典礼在北京市总工会副主席刘莱夫主持下进行。刘莱夫首先讲话，他说这次展览会明确地告诉我们四件事：第一、为了胜利完成爱国增产节约任务，必须大力推广先进经验。例如北京电车修造厂的球墨铸铁、琉璃河水泥厂的快速烧成法、华北农业机械总厂的黄润萍仓库管理法及建筑工业中的各种先进工作法等，在提高工作效率和积累国家财富上都起了很大的作用。第二、这次展览品中，有不少是学习苏联先进经验的结果。北京铁路分局、北京机器总厂等的球墨铸铁、自来水公司的接管打灰口等，都是学习的苏联经验，解决了生产上重要的问题。这说明社会主义国家苏联的先进经验，是非常宝贵的，我们必须肃清崇拜英美的资产阶级思想，树立技术上“一边倒”——向苏联学习的思想。第三、在推广先进经验中，必须打破保守思想。任何一种先进生产经验的产生和推广，都会遇到各种的思想障碍，我们今后必须加强教育，使推广先进经验能顺利进行。第四、在总结和推广先进经验中，必须加强技术人员和工人的结合。这也是这次展览品中的一个最大的特点。工人说：“工程人员理论高，工人同志经验好，两下一结合，窍门出来了。”
    中华全国总工会华北工作委员会主任康永和、北京市人民政府副市长吴晗均应邀讲话。他们在讲话中都强调指出：总结和推广先进经验是开展爱国增产节约运动的主要方法，必须广泛地深入地进行宣传；同时总结和推广先进经验是一个细致的工作，今后必须更有组织、有领导、有计划地进行。
    在会上，石景山发电厂工人、全国劳动模范刘德珍，京西门头沟煤矿工人、全国劳动模范李书和，北京电车公司工程师王子厚都讲了话，他们具体介绍了各自学习苏联先进经验的心得。
    典礼举行完毕，到会的首都各方面的先进生产者和来宾按序步入展览馆。“北京先进生产经验展览会”，便正式揭幕了。
