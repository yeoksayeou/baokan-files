    Soviet "Pravda" Publishes Article Commenting on the "White Haired Girl" Performed in Moscow

    Recently, "Pravda" published an article by Lukin, commenting on the play "The White Haired Girl" by Chinese playwrights and Stalin Prize winners He Jingzhi and Ding Yi, which began its performance at the Moscow Vakhtangov Theatre on June 13th.

    Lukin wrote: The Soviet people are extremely concerned about the lives of working people in other countries and their struggles for freedom, peace, democracy, and socialism. Progressive writers truthfully reflect the profound changes in the lives of people in various countries today, the revolutionary development of events, and they artistically depict the thoughts and feelings of the people, creating noble images that call for struggle against all that is old and dying, and proclaim the victory of the new things that are being born.

    Lukin pointed out: The cultural exchanges between the Soviet people and the great Chinese people are becoming wider and more significant. Another gratifying step in this direction is the performance of "The White Haired Girl" at the Vakhtangov Theatre.

    This play vividly reflects the typical development of modern Chinese literature and art. The literature and art of free China, while preserving all the characteristics of national form, are filled with new content and are developing along the path of socialist realism.

    This play is a folk drama. It realistically portrays the characters, describes sharp contradictions, and preserves many traditions of Chinese folk opera. The characters in the play are clearly divided into two opposing camps: the working peasants versus their oppressors - the landlords and their henchmen.

    The plot of this play is true to life, powerful, and tense. It maintains its original form: the characters in the play not only have lines and interactions with each other, but they often speak directly to the audience, allowing the audience to understand the development of the plot, conveying their emotions to the audience, and winning their sympathy and support. The play is often performed at the front of the stage.

    Lukin continued: The Vakhtangov Theatre's performance fully expresses talent and enthusiasm. It expresses all the characteristics of this play - its deep connection with the people, and the humaneness and freshness of the characters. The entire cast of the theatre has experienced something in this play by Chinese playwrights that is similar to the best emotions and best traditions they have formed in the process of creative work. This resonance between the playwrights and the actors makes the performance extremely outstanding. The actors of the Vakhtangov Theatre have created many vivid characters with moving folk colors. Bershikova's performance as Xi'er is another success for her. Pokrovsky and Glikov portray the peasants Yang Bailao and Uncle Zhao with rich thoughts and feelings. Pokrovsky, as Yang Bailao, successfully reveals the entire despair of a person who feels trapped and tragically commits suicide. Glikov skillfully uses subtle psychological techniques to express the people's patience and wisdom, their confidence in their strength, and their hope for liberation through the role of Uncle Zhao. It is Uncle Zhao who points out the path for Wang Dachun to join the Red Army. Alekseyeva, playing Aunt Wang, portrays a very outstanding woman among the people.

    The directors, Gerasimov, Riosnova, etc., skillfully combine the characteristics of Chinese folk colors with the theatre's creative principles, making the performance extremely moving. The entire cast of the theatre performs with enthusiasm.

    Lukin pointed out: The performance of "The White Haired Girl" adds luster to the history of the theatre's performances; this performance proves that the cultural ties between the Soviet people and the free Chinese people are growing and strengthening.

### 苏联“真理报”载文评述莫斯科演出的“白毛女”

    苏联“真理报”载文评述莫斯科演出的“白毛女”
    最近“真理报”发表卢金的一篇文章，评述莫斯科瓦赫坦戈夫剧院于六月十三日开始演出的，中国剧作家、斯大林奖金得奖人贺敬之和丁毅所作的“白毛女”一剧。
    卢金写道：苏联人民，对其他国家劳动人民的生活，对他们争取自由、和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，都极为关切。进步作家们在他们的作品中，真实地反映了今日各国人民生活中的深刻变化，事态的革命发展，他们以艺术的形式描绘出人民的思想感情，创造了崇高的形象，号召对一切陈旧的，垂死的事物作斗争，宣布正在产生的新事物的胜利。
    卢金指出：苏联人民和伟大的中国人民的文化交流，范围愈来愈广，意义愈来愈重要。这方面又一个令人满意的步骤，就是瓦赫坦戈夫剧院的演出“白毛女”。
    这个剧本显明地反映了近代中国文学和艺术的典型发展。自由中国的文学和艺术，一方面保存了民族形式的一切特点，一方面充满了新的内容，正在沿着社会主义写实主义的道路发展。
    这个剧本是一个民间剧。它写实主义地刻划了人物的性格，描述了尖锐的矛盾，并保存了中国民间戏的许多传统。剧中角色清楚地分属两个敌对阵营，劳动农民对他们的压迫者——地主及其狗腿子。
    这个剧本的情节忠于生活、有力而且紧张。它保持了原来的形式：剧中的角色不仅相互之间有戏有台词，并且他们常常直接对观众讲话，使观众了解情节的发展，把他们的感情告诉观众，赢取观众的同情和支持。戏常常移到舞台的前部来演。
    卢金继续写道：瓦赫坦戈夫剧院的演出，充分表现了才能和热情。它表达了这个剧本的一切特点——与人民的深厚联系、人物形象之富于人情味和新鲜感。剧院全体演员体验到中国剧作家的这个剧本中有某种东西与他们在创造性工作过程中所形成的最好的感情、最好的传统有着类似的地方。剧作者与演员之间的这种共鸣，使得表演极为出色。瓦赫坦戈夫剧院的演员们以动人的民间色彩创造了许多栩栩如生的人物。柏希柯娃演出喜儿，是她又一次的成功。波克罗夫斯基和格利科夫以丰富的思想和感情饰演农民杨白劳和赵大叔。演杨白劳的波克罗夫斯基成功地表露了一个觉得走头无路而悲惨地以自杀了之的人的全部绝望情绪，格利科夫则利用含蓄的心理手法巧妙地借赵大叔这个角色表现出人民的耐心和智慧，他们对他们力量的信心以及他们对解放的希望。是赵大叔给王大春指明了他参加红军的路。演王大婶的阿列克塞耶娃刻划出人民中一个非常杰出的女人。
    导演格拉西莫夫、里奥斯诺娃等，能干地把中国民间色彩的特点与该剧院的创造性原则结合起来，使演出极为动人。剧院全体演员都热情演出。
    卢金指出：“白毛女”的演出是使剧院的演出史上增加了光辉；这次演出证明了苏联人民和自由中国人民之间的文化联系，正在增长加强。
