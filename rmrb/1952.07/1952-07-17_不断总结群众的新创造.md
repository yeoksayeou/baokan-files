    Continuously Summarize New Creations of the Masses

    The All-China Coal Miners' Trade Union has continued to summarize new creations of various mines in tunneling work, further enriching and completing the advanced experience of Ma Liu-hai and others which is being promoted, and has advanced the advanced experience of coal mine tunneling work a step further. This kind of summarization work is an important working method worth recommending.

    In the process of promoting advanced experience, workers in various regions have many new creations, constantly supplementing and developing existing experience. However, these creations are often scattered in various regions, and are often relatively sporadic. Even, a problem has been well solved in one enterprise, but has not yet been solved in other enterprises. Relevant Party committees, administrations, and trade union leadership organizations at all levels, if they can pay attention to discovering the bits and pieces of creation of workers in various places at any time and any place, and continuously summarize and study them to enrich the advanced experience being promoted, then the advanced experience will become more and more complete and richer, and the promotion work will not remain at the existing level, but can continue to move forward. For example, the multi-hole cyclic operation method of the Ma Liu-hai group, plus several important improvements in drilling and blasting technology summarized by the All-China Coal Miners' Trade Union this time, has become a more complete tunneling experience. In the future, when various mines implement the advanced experience of the Ma Liu-hai group, they should simultaneously adopt these improved methods to continue to improve the efficiency of tunneling work, continue to accelerate the progress, and continue to reduce costs.

    Other enterprise departments should pay attention to absorbing these improved methods in the process of promoting advanced experience, and prevent and oppose the harmful ideas of being satisfied with existing experience or ignoring the creations of the masses.

    不断总结群众的新创造
    煤矿工会全国委员会继续总结了各矿在掘进工作中的新创造，使正在推广中的马六孩等的先进经验更为充实完整，把煤矿掘进工作的先进经验向前推进了一步。这样的总结工作是值得推荐的重要的工作方法。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，各地工人都有很多新的创造，不断地补充和发展了已有的经验。但是，这些创造常常是分散在各个地区，又常常是比较零星的，甚至，一个问题在这个企业里已被很好地解决，在其他的企业里却还没有解决。有关的党委、行政和工会的各级领导机构，如果能够随时随地注意发现各地工人的一点一滴的创造，不断地加以总结研究，用以充实正在推广中的先进经验，这样先进经验就会日益完整日益丰富，推广工作也就不会停留在既有的水平上，而能够不断前进。例如马六孩小组的多孔循环作业法，加上这次煤矿工会全国委员会总结出来的打眼放炮技术上的几项重要改进，就成了一个更为完整的掘进经验。今后各个矿山在推行马六孩小组的先进经验时，应该同时采取这几项改进的办法，使掘进工作的效率继续提高，进度继续加快，成本继续降低。
    其他企业部门在推行先进经验的过程中，都应该注意吸取这些改进的办法，防止和反对那种满足于既有的经验，或者忽视群众创造的有害的思想。
