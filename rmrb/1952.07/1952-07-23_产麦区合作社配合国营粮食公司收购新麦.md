Cooperatives in wheat-producing areas cooperate with state-owned grain companies to purchase new wheat

In order to actively cooperate with state-owned grain companies to complete the purchase of new wheat and meet the demands of farmers to sell new wheat, cooperatives in wheat-producing areas across the country have universally launched purchasing work. By the end of June, cooperatives in the entire East China region and in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Henan provinces had established 4,184 new wheat purchasing stations, with tens of thousands of people directly participating in the purchasing work. According to statistics, in June, cooperatives purchased a total of 352.04 million catties of new wheat. The proportion of purchases by cooperatives in mid-June accounted for 26.2 percent of the total purchases by state-owned companies, which rapidly increased to 60.3 percent in late June.

After the new wheat came on the market, price gouging by private merchants occurred in some areas for a time. However, due to the active cooperation of cooperatives with state-owned companies to launch purchasing, and the implementation of the correct policy of paying higher prices for better wheat and grading according to quality, the above situation has been reversed. For example, private merchants in Liyang County, Southern Jiangsu, lowered the purchase price to 600 yuan per catty before the cooperatives and state-owned grain companies started purchasing; after the cooperatives and grain companies started purchasing, the price of wheat per catty was raised to 800 to 850 yuan, thus protecting the interests of farmers selling wheat. In Taierzhuang, Shandong, Qihe and other places, the market price was too low at the beginning of the purchase, but by mid-June, the market price had tended to match the official price.

In combining purchasing with supply work, cooperatives in various places have prepared a large amount of food, cloth, cooking oil, salt, kerosene, matches, fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, pesticides and other production and living materials to supply to farmers. The planned supply ratio is generally more than 50 percent of the purchase and investment amount. Cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, and Tongxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, have further promoted the method of delivering goods to the countryside and buying and selling at the same time (purchasing new wheat). The delivery group of the Xinjia Cooperative in Sanhe County, Tongxian Prefecture, sold 2.8 million yuan worth of goods in one trip to Qiaotou Village, and recovered more than 7,000 catties of new wheat.

In order to strengthen the purchasing work of cooperatives, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued two instructions and, in mid-June, jointly with the China Grain Corporation, organized three joint inspection teams for East China, North China, and Northwest China to directly inspect and promote the purchasing work in wheat-producing areas. Cooperatives in major regions, provinces, and counties also generally held purchasing meetings, signed purchasing contracts, and made purchasing arrangements before the purchasing began. In Northern Jiangsu and other places, under the unified leadership of the local Financial and Economic Committee, the cooperatives, the Industry and Commerce Section, the Grain Corporation, and the bank established a joint office to uniformly manage the purchasing work.

    产麦区合作社配合国营粮食公司收购新麦
    为了积极配合国营粮食公司完成新麦收购工作和满足农民出售新麦的要求，全国各产麦区合作社已普遍展开收购工作。到六月底，华东全区及河北、平原、河南三省的合作社已设立了四千一百八十四处新麦收购站，直接参加收购工作的有数万人。据统计：六月份合作社共收购新麦三亿五千二百零四万斤，合作社六月中旬收购比例为国营公司收购总数的百分之二十六点二，下旬即迅速增至百分之六十点三。
    在新麦登场后，部分地区曾经一度发生私商压价现象，但由于合作社积极配合国营公司展开收购，贯彻了优麦优价、按等论价的正确政策，已经扭转了上述情况。如苏南溧阳县私商，在合作社和国营粮食公司收购之前，将收购价压低到每斤六百元；合作社和粮食公司进行收购后，每斤小麦价格就提到八百元到八百五十元，因而保护了售麦农民的利益。山东台儿庄、齐河等地在收购初期也有市价过低现象，到六月中旬都已趋向牌、市价吻合。
    各地合作社在结合收购开展供应工作中，都准备了大量食粮、布匹、食油、盐、煤油、火柴、肥料、种籽、农具、农药及其他生产、生活资料供应农民。计划供应的比例一般都在收购投放额百分之五十以上。河南省许昌专区和河北通县专区合作社更推广了送货下乡，随卖随买（收购新麦）方式；通县专区三河县新集合作社送货组到桥头村，一次即卖货二百八十万元；收回新麦七千多斤。
    为了加强合作社的收购工作，全国合作总社曾发出两次指示，并于六月中旬会同中国粮食公司组织了华东、华北、西北三个联合检查组，深入产麦区直接检查推动收购工作；各大区、省、县合作社在收购前也普遍召开了收购会议，签订收购合同，作了收购布置；苏北区等地，并在当地财政经济委员会统一领导下由合作社、工商科、粮食公司、银行等单位成立了联合办公室，统一掌握收购工作。（韩寰）
