The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation Head Office
Pay Attention to Publicity and Explanatory Work for Translated Films

    Because some translated films' themes and content have certain distances from the lives, customs, and habits of our people; and because our broad worker-peasant-soldier audiences are still somewhat unfamiliar with the propaganda form of film art, some translated films are often misunderstood or not understood by some viewers. It is especially difficult to understand some historical films, biographical films, and films with international current affairs and national life as their themes, such as "The Conspiracy," "Secret Envoy," "Happy Life," and "Baltic Deputy." In addition to suggesting to the film studios that translate films to pay attention to popularization, the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation Head Office has instructed its subordinate units to pay attention to helping basic audiences understand films and explain confusing parts of the films.
    In the past, the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation Head Office has compiled and printed publicity materials for some films (including explanations of terms, scene explanations, historical and social backgrounds, character explanations, and reference materials for scripts), and distributed them to various district companies, offices, and stations for local cinemas to display slide subtitles, announcers to broadcast, film critics to write reviews, and local newspapers and periodicals to publish introductions. However, this work has not been done enough. In the future, the company has decided to strengthen the supply of publicity materials. Publicity staff of various district companies, offices, and stations, and staff of various cinemas and film projection teams, especially cinemas, must pay attention to using publicity materials. The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation Head Office hopes that film publicity workers in various places will pay attention to the following tasks:
    1.  According to the actual needs of local audiences, adapt and rewrite the publicity materials supplied by the head office into things that audiences can accept, such as film brochures, and distribute them to the audience, changing the past situation of discarding publicity materials on shelves. In addition, film publicity workers in various places should promptly collect the masses' reactions and difficult problems about films, estimate the possible impact, and carry out necessary and timely explanatory work.
    2.  Pay attention to organizing the strength of comrades working in professional departments, and pay attention to using the strength of the masses and mass organizations.
    Since film publicity workers cannot fully explain and comment on some films (such as science films, biographical films, and historical films), it is necessary to consult experts and ask them to write articles, give reports, and broadcast. For example, when the film "Michurin" is shown, in addition to the materials supplied by the head office, various places should invite local scientific workers to help publicize and make popular explanations. Film distribution agencies in various places should strengthen contact with local cultural and educational and propaganda departments, and listen to their opinions on the publicity work of each film. At the same time, when carrying out film publicity work, we must not ignore the opinions of the masses and mass organizations on the publicity work of each film.
    3.  Establish and strengthen the film publicity and explanatory work of cinemas and film projection teams. Some state-owned and public cinemas have established some publicity and explanatory work systems for cinemas, such as displaying slide subtitles, announcers using broadcasting equipment to explain the plot, characters, and scenes that audiences find difficult to understand, and printing small publicity materials. These works have been praised by the audience. However, not every film does this, not every cinema does this, and some state-owned and private cinemas have not established this work at all. In the future, cinemas that have established this work should strengthen it, and district companies, offices, and distribution stations are responsible for supervising and mobilizing cinemas (whether state-owned or private) that have not established this work system to establish this work. If the manpower is not enough, it is necessary to increase the allocation of publicity and reporting personnel. Film projection teams in various places have created some publicity methods in the past, such as using blackboard newspapers and photo exhibitions, and using popular forms such as storytelling and singing for publicity, which are all good experiences. We should continue to carry forward the spirit of creation in the future. Projection teams that have not established a publicity work system should establish it immediately. It should be clearly recognized that film publicity work is an equally important business as showing films for a projection team.

    中国影片经理公司总公司
    注意关于翻译片的宣传解释工作
    由于一些翻译影片的题材及内容与我国人民生活、风俗、习惯有某些距离；由于我国广大工农兵观众目前对电影艺术这一宣传形式尚感到某种程度的生疏，有一些翻译片常常有一部分观众看不懂，或误解它的内容。尤其不易看懂的是一些历史片、传记片、以及以国际时事和民族生活为题材的影片。像“阴谋”“秘密使节”“幸福的生活”“波罗的海代表”等。中国影片经理公司总公司除已向译制各电影制片厂建议注意翻译片的通俗化外，已指示其所属单位注意帮助基本观众看懂电影，解释影片中费解的地方。
    过去中国影片经理公司总公司曾经编印过某一些影片的宣传材料（包括名词解释、场面解释、历史社会背景、人物解释及文稿等参考材料），发给各区公司、处站，供各地影院打幻灯字幕、报告员播音、影评撰述人员参考及各地报刊刊载介绍之用，但这工作做得不够。今后，该公司决定加强宣传材料的供应工作。各区公司、处、站的宣传工作人员及各影院、各放映队工作人员特别是电影院，必须注意运用宣传材料。中国影片经理公司总公司希望各地电影宣传工作者注意做好以下几点工作：
    一、根据当地观众实际的需要，把总公司供给的宣传材料改编、改写成观众能接受的东西，如电影说明书等，分发观众。改变过去将宣传品废置在橱架中的情形。另外，各地影片宣传工作者应及时收集群众对影片的反应和疑难问题，估计到可能会发生的影响，进行必要的及时的解释工作。
    二、注意组织专业部门工作同志的力量，注意运用群众及群众性组织的力量。
    由于影片宣传工作者对有些影片（如科学片、传记片、历史片）是不可能完全加以解释和评介的，这就需要向专门家请教，请他们撰写文稿，做报告，广播。如“米丘林”影片演出时，除总公司供给一些材料外，各地宜邀请当地科学工作者帮助宣传及作通俗化的解释工作。各地影片发行机构，应加强与当地文教、宣传部门的联系，听取他们对每部影片宣传工作的意见。同时在进行影片宣传工作时，千万不可忽视群众及群众团体对于每部影片的宣传工作的意见。
    三、建立并加强电影院及电影放映队的影片宣传、解释工作。有些国营、公营影院已经建立了一些影院的宣传解释工作制度，像打幻灯字幕，报告员用播音器解释剧情、人物及观众费解的场面，印发小型的宣传品等。这些工作受到观众的赞许。但并不是每一部影片都这样做，并不是每一家影院都这样做，有些国营及私营影院根本没有建立这项工作。今后已建立这项工作的影院应加强，尚未建立这项工作制度的影院（无论国营、私营），各区公司、办事处、发行站有责任督促，动员他们建立这项工作。如因人力不够，必要时可增加配备宣传、报告人员。各地电影放映队过去曾创造了一些宣传办法，如利用黑板报及剧照展览，利用说唱等通俗形式进行宣传等，这都是较好的经验。今后应继续发扬创造精神。尚未建立宣传工作制度的放映队应即建立。应该明确地认识影片宣传工作对于一个放映队来说是与放映影片同样重要的业务。
