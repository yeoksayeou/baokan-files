Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 26th: A front-line correspondent for this agency reports on the recent successful campaign by the Chinese and Korean People's Army on the Western Front to clear enemy mines: To reduce their ever-increasing troop losses, the American invading army has, since this spring, been trying its best to strengthen the defensive works of their positions, increasing the number of barbed wire fences from the original four to thirteen, and placing many different kinds of mines in front of their positions, attempting to use this method to obstruct and kill our attacking troops. However, in the face of the brave and resourceful soldiers of our army, the enemy's attempt has failed.

In February of this year, Yao Xianru, squad leader of the 8th Squad of the 3rd Company of a certain unit of our army, was ordered to take four soldiers to reconnoiter the enemy's situation. On a hillside, a wire tripped Yao Xianru's left foot. He cautiously put down his right foot and looked into the grass, where he saw a square iron block - a landmine! He thought, "As long as I pull the firing pin with a grass rope, this landmine can explode. However, this will only destroy one landmine. If I seize this landmine and study it, I can learn from it and subdue more landmines." So, he bit the wire with his teeth, reached his hands under the mine, and gently lifted it. The brave Yao Xianru was determined to completely subdue this landmine. He ordered three soldiers to continue to monitor the enemy from a distance, and said to Zhang Zhenjiang, the soldier next to him, "Watch me dismantle it carefully. If I sacrifice, you must remember how it was detonated, learn from it, and experiment later." He dismantled it cautiously and finally took off the "firing mechanism." Yao Xianru defeated the enemy's landmine and became the first hero in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army to clear landmines. After Yao Xianru's experience in clearing landmines was spread, a wave of enthusiasm for clearing landmines appeared in the front-line troops in this area. They said, "We can still capture live devils, can't we subdue these dead things made of iron!" With the help of military instructors, they studied hard and practiced diligently. Now they can skillfully take out the landmines from the ground, dismantle them, and put them back together. At the same time, they created a simple landmine detector. Thus, countless infantry soldiers have become experts in clearing landmines. Small groups of three to five people often appear on the enemy's front lines, turning many of the enemy's landmines into scrap iron, destroying and weakening the enemy's defensive works, and enabling the warriors of our army to strike the enemy smoothly. In April and May alone, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army recovered 1,985 landmines. The mine-clearing hero Yao Xianru alone recovered 227 mines and destroyed more than 300 in four months.

The soldiers also used the captured landmines to fight back against the enemy. They said, "This is also saving for the people of the motherland!" One night, more than thirty enemies attempted to attack a small hill of our army. When the enemy approached the front line of our army, they were met by a burst of submachine guns. When the enemy saw that the sneak attack had failed, they turned around and ran away. At this time, "Boom!" "Boom!" Two American landmines were detonated, blasting the enemy into a disarray. Our soldiers not only buried American landmines on our front lines, but also buried them in areas close to the enemy's front lines. Once, nine enemy officers climbed to a small hill to look at the terrain, and one of them was injured by a landmine buried by our soldiers. The enemy sent stretchers and helicopters to rescue them, but when four enemy soldiers carried the injured officer toward the helicopter, another landmine exploded, and the helicopter hurriedly flew away, unable to save the people. The next day, the landmines buried on this hill also injured the mine-sweeping troops sent by the enemy. On another occasion, Huang Shilv, the squad leader of a certain company of a certain unit of our army, used American landmines to set up a minefield on a highway. It happened that the enemy drove seven tanks and a jeep on this road that day, and as a result, four tanks were destroyed.

    朝中部队开展排除敌军地雷运动
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线通讯员报道中朝人民军队最近在西线胜利地开展排除敌军地雷运动的情形说：美国侵略军为了减少不断增加的兵员损失，从今年春天开始，曾竭力加强其阵地上的附防御工事，铁丝网由原来的四道加到十三道，并且特别在阵地面前设置了许多各种各样的地雷，企图用这种办法来阻挠、杀伤我军的出击部队。但是在勇敢、机智的我军战士面前，敌人的企图失败了。
    今年二月里，我军某部三连八班长姚显儒奉命带着四个战士去侦察敌人情况。在一个山坡上，一根铁丝绊住了姚显儒的左脚。他警觉地把右脚放下，向草丛里一看，是一个四方形的铁块——地雷！他想：“只要用一根草绳把拉火绳一拉，这颗地雷就可以爆炸，可是，这样只能破坏一个地雷，如果抓住这个地雷进行研究，从中吸取经验就能制服更多的地雷。”于是，他用牙齿把铁丝咬断，两手伸向雷底，轻轻地将它搬起来。勇敢的姚显儒决心要彻底制服这个地雷，他命令三个战士继续在远处监视敌方，又对身旁的战士张振江说：“你在一旁仔细看我拆卸，如果我牺牲了，你们要好好记住是怎样弄响的，从中接受教训，以后再作试验。”他谨慎小心地拆卸，终于把“发火具”拆下来了，姚显儒战胜了敌人的地雷，成为志愿军某部的第一个排除地雷的英雄。姚显儒的排除地雷经验被传开后，这一带前线部队普遍地出现了排除地雷的热潮。他们说：“活鬼子还能抓到，这些铁做的死东西还制不了它！”在军事教员的帮助下，他们勤学苦练，现在他们都能够熟练地把地雷从地下起出来拆开又装好。同时，他们创造了简便的地雷探测器。于是无数步兵战士都成了排除地雷的能手。三五成群的排除地雷小组，经常出没在敌人的阵地前沿，把敌人许多地雷都变成废铁，破坏和削弱了敌军的附防御工事，使我军的勇士们能顺利地打击敌人。在四、五两个月中，仅志愿军某部就起回一千九百八十五个地雷。排雷英雄姚显儒一个人在四个月中起雷二百二十七个，并破坏了三百多个。
    战士们还利用缴获的地雷去还击敌人。他们说：“这也就是为祖国人民节约啊！”一天夜里，三十多个敌人企图来偷袭我军的一个小山头，当敌人刚一接近我军阵地前沿，迎头就碰上了一阵冲锋枪，敌人见偷袭不成，回头就跑。这时，“轰！”“轰！”两颗美国地雷被踏响了，炸得敌人狼狈逃去。我军战士不仅把美国地雷埋在我军前沿，而且还把它埋到靠近敌人前沿的地带。一次，九个敌军军官爬到一个小山岭上看地形，被我军战士埋的地雷炸伤了一个，敌人派了担架和直升飞机来救，但当四个敌兵抬着受伤的军官向直升飞机走去的时候，一颗地雷又爆炸了，直升飞机也顾不得救人，急忙飞走。第二天，埋在这个山岭上的地雷还炸伤了敌军派来的扫雷部队。还有一次，我军某部某连班长黄世绿用美国地雷在一条公路上设下了地雷阵，恰巧那天敌人从这条路开来了七辆坦克和一辆吉普，结果炸毁了四辆坦克。
