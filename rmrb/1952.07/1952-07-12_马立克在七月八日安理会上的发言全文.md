The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary, when commencing discussion of the second proposal submitted by the United States representative to the Security Council, to once again draw the Security Council's attention to the fact that discussing the issue of the United States armed forces' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China without the participation of representatives from Korea and China is not only illegal but also makes it impossible to understand the truth.

**Documents from the Korean and Chinese governments and international democratic organizations fully confirm the crime of the U.S. military using bacteriological weapons**

The Security Council has before it numerous formal documents that irrefutably prove the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces in Korea and China. The United Nations Secretariat has received several official statements from the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding this matter; it has also received numerous letters and telegrams from international democratic organizations. Many of the remarks quoted by the United States representative in his speech are extracted from these statements and formal documents, and every representative on the Security Council can study all these facts from the aforementioned formal documents. The United States representative groundlessly attributes these statements to Soviet newspapers and Soviet radio stations. Soviet newspapers and radio stations are merely reporting the facts presented in the aforementioned formal documents published by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as in many official statements submitted to the United Nations by international democratic organizations concerning the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces against Korea and China.

From these formal documents, it can be seen that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in its Foreign Minister Park Heun-young's statement of February 22, 1952, listed many specific facts regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

From these documents, it can be seen that the government of the People's Republic of China, in its Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of March 8, 1952, lodged a serious protest against the United States government's use of bacteriological weapons to slaughter the Chinese people and its dispatch of U.S. aircraft to invade Chinese territory. The statement of the Central People's Government of China cited many specific facts illustrating the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces against the Chinese people in Northeast China in February and March of this year.

The statement said: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that, in order to achieve its goals of expanding the Korean War and undermining peace in the Far East and the world, the United States government has not only used bacteriological weapons, which are absolutely prohibited by international conventions and human morality, against peaceful people and the Korean and Chinese People's Armed Forces in Korea, but has even expanded this crime to include the use of these illegal bacteriological weapons against the peaceful people of Northeast China, engaging in barbaric provocations."

The telegram from Foreign Minister Park Heun-young of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on April 21 of this year contains this formal statement from the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: Many impartial representatives of world public opinion, including the International Women's Commission of Inquiry into Atrocities by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee Troops in Korea, the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and journalists from the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries, have irrefutably proven the use of bacteriological weapons by the American interventionist troops.

Other documents received by the Security Council regarding this matter include a letter from the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. Attached to this letter are two reports: "Report on American Crimes in Korea" and "Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by American Troops on Chinese Territory." Both reports were submitted by the investigation team of legal professionals who went to Korea and China to investigate the facts of the use of bacteriological weapons. The aforementioned letter from the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to the Security Council states: After studying all the materials, the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers specifically declares that the facts revealed by its investigation team prove that the heinous crimes being committed by the U.S. military are not only directed at the Korean army but also at the Korean civilians.

Specifically, these crimes include: the use of chemical weapons, massacres, torture and atrocities, airstrikes against peaceful residents, looting and destruction of property and precious cultural relics, and, in particular, it should be emphasized that these troops used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

All these materials have been published as official documents of the Security Council, and everyone can study these documents. These documents contain irrefutable evidence of the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military in Korea against the Korean and Chinese people.

This irrefutable evidence exposes the purpose of the new proposal by the U.S. government to the Security Council, which is to provocatively slander and defame the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must firmly point out the provocative nature of this proposal and the recommendations within it. The recommendations put forward in this proposal are clearly intended to divert world public opinion from the issue of the U.S. government's responsibility for the use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people.

The claim in this proposal that the U.S. military command in Korea has flatly denied using bacteriological weapons is unconvincing and untenable. The U.S. government's persistent opposition to the participation of representatives from Korea and China in the Security Council's discussion of the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military in Korea and China exposes the fact that the U.S. military command's and the U.S. government's attempts to flatly deny the use of bacteriological weapons are completely unfounded.

**The U.S. so-called "International" Committee of the Red Cross is a group of people used as a tool of U.S. policy**

As for the so-called "International" Committee of the Red Cross mentioned in the U.S. proposal, it should be stated that the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have rightly rejected the suggestion of an investigation by this committee, because this committee is not an international organization but a group of people used as a tool of U.S. policy.

It is already known that this so-called "International" Committee of the Red Cross, which the U.S. government is trying to pass off as an "objective investigator," is not an international organization at all. It is an organization of Switzerland alone, although it uses the name "International Committee of the Red Cross."

During the Second World War, this committee did not say a word to defend the victims who suffered from the crimes of the Hitlerite bandits in the occupied areas. In fact, it covered up the war crimes of the Hitlerite bandits, just as it is now, to please the American aggressors, silently covering up their heinous crimes against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island.

Naturally, it is impossible for such a committee to work impartially like an international organization.

It is also well known that the committee's representative in Tokyo and at the U.S. military command in Korea is Reiner, who said that everything was fine when he initially investigated the Hitler concentration camps.

Therefore, there is no reason to expect even a hint of objectivity from an organization that has already discredited itself and is now operating under the banner of the "International Committee of the Red Cross." In action, this committee has proven itself to be an accomplice and servant of the Americans who are aggressing against Korea.

Based on these facts, it is now clear that the U.S. government's insistence on its proposal for an investigation by the aforementioned committee is an attempt to obstruct the participation of Chinese and Korean representatives in the Security Council's discussion of the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people.

The lack of merit in the U.S. proposal is also confirmed by the U.S. attempt to submit the issue to the World Health Organization. This approach is unfounded and should be rejected most resolutely.

The Security Council's archives contain the telegram from Foreign Minister Park Heun-young of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on April 21 of this year, to which I have already drawn the Security Council's attention. This telegram points out that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has prevented the spread of infectious diseases and believes that it will certainly be able to thwart any conspiracies hatched by the enemy in the future, and that with the assistance of democratic countries, it has the means to combat infectious diseases and the vectors of infectious agents spread by the American aggressors on Korean territory. It does not need the help of an organization like the World Health Organization.

Regarding the World Health Organization itself, the aforementioned telegram from Park Heun-young states: "As is well known, the so-called World Health Organization lacks the necessary international prestige. Therefore, the Korean people cannot expect the assistance of this organization. Many countries are not members of this organization. At the same time, this organization has not carried out any activities for many years in performing its task of preventing diseases and fighting against them, and it is also well known that since 1949, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and some other countries have announced their withdrawal from the organization."

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the Korean people, expresses its hope that the United Nations will resolutely condemn the crimes of the American interventionists in using bacteriological weapons and their other crimes that violate international law and human moral principles, and at the same time reiterates its demand that the United Nations immediately take measures to stop the war crimes of the American aggressors in Korea.

In view of the above, it can be clearly seen that the claim in the U.S. proposal to submit the issue to the so-called World Health Organization is unfounded, and its sole purpose is to conceal the U.S. government's refusal to ban bacteriological weapons.

**The U.S. refusal to invite representatives from China and Korea to participate in the discussion is an act that violates the United Nations Charter and customary practices**

In view of the aforementioned facts cited from the official statements of the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as from the official documents submitted to the United Nations and the Security Council by many international democratic organizations, it is necessary to emphasize particularly in the Security Council that the fact that the U.S. armed forces used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China has been confirmed by authoritative international investigation teams and is already known to the whole world. The words in foreign newspapers that the U.S. representative quoted in his speech today confirm this point. From these words, it can be seen that Indonesia and Brazil know about these things, Italy knows about these things, and all countries around the world know about these things. The American aggressors cannot obliterate these facts. Attempts to deny these facts by using slander and fabrications (some of which are directed against the Soviet Union) are doomed to failure.

In its statement of July 1, the Soviet delegation stated its attitude towards the proposal submitted to the Security Council by the U.S. delegation. The Soviet delegation requested the Security Council to note that the purpose of the U.S. proposal is to deceive public opinion, to distract people from the fact that the U.S. military is using prohibited bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, and to conceal the U.S. government's refusal to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons.

In addition, the U.S. has rejected the Soviet proposal that representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea be invited to participate when the United Nations Security Council discusses the issue of the U.S. armed forces' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. In this way, the U.S. has obstructed the United Nations from studying this issue legitimately, that is, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all relevant parties should participate in the discussion when studying an issue.

It is also completely untenable for the U.S. representative to mention the Disarmament Commission. In the Disarmament Commission, the U.S. delegation and its accomplices in the Atlantic aggressive bloc rejected the Soviet proposal to discuss this issue. Now, in the Security Council, the U.S. representative is distorting the truth, trying to make it seem that the Soviet representative did not seem to suggest inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Disarmament Commission. However, the U.S. representative did not mention that there was no opportunity to put forward such a suggestion in the Disarmament Commission because the Soviet proposal to study the issue of prohibiting bacteriological weapons and punishing those who violate the ban was rejected by the U.S. representative and its accomplices in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

This is the truth of the matter. This shows how absurd the arguments presented here by the U.S. representative are. In addition, everyone knows that the Security Council always invites all relevant parties to participate when discussing any contentious issue. This has become a fixed practice. This is clearly stipulated in Article 32 of the Charter; and it is also listed in the Rules of Procedure of the Security Council. In light of the above facts, the U.S. representative has no reason to compare the procedures for discussing issues in the Disarmament Commission with the procedures for discussing issues in the Security Council. Just raising this question from this perspective is enough to expose that the arguments presented here by the U.S. representative are very absurd and completely unfounded.

Since the U.S. cannot get the Security Council to accept a decision that clearly violates the procedural rules stipulated in the United Nations Charter, it is once again attempting to flagrantly violate the procedures stipulated in the Charter, forcing the Security Council to review another illegal unilateral proposal, which is clearly provocative and slanderous.

**The U.S. put forward this slanderous proposal to conceal its conspiracy to refuse to condemn bacteriological warfare**

The U.S. government's purpose in putting forward this proposal is to conceal its own actions of refusing to condemn the use of bacteriological weapons and refusing to ratify the Geneva Protocol, so as to divert public opinion from the U.S. government's opposition to the prohibition and condemnation of the use of bacteriological weapons.

The U.S. representative groundlessly spoke about the so-called disarmament plan supposedly put forward by the U.S. in the United Nations Disarmament Commission. This action is not worth laughing at because the Security Council and the whole world know that the U.S. representative or his British or French companions have never put forward any "disarmament plan" in the Disarmament Commission. The U.S. representative in the Disarmament Commission has in the past and is now, and will apparently continue to try to replace the issue of disarmament and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons and all kinds of weapons of mass destruction (including bacteriological weapons) with a proposal on collecting military intelligence, and only on conventional military intelligence.

After this attempt failed, Britain and France came out to help the U.S. They jointly attempted to replace the proposal on disarmament and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction with a segmented proposal on determining the so-called "levels" of armed forces only. Such proposals have nothing in common with a disarmament plan, and they have nothing in common with the proposal on disarmament and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; they have no and cannot have anything in common. The U.S. representative's unfounded mention of these proposals in the Security Council is purely a deceptive propaganda tactic, the purpose of which is to conceal the U.S. government's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol, to conceal the U.S. government's violation of the prohibition on bacteriological weapons. The only genuine and all-encompassing plan for disarmament and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction has been submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. This is the plan put forward by the Soviet Union, but the U.S. government stubbornly refuses this plan. These are all well-known facts.

For the above reasons, the Soviet delegation believes it is impossible to participate in the discussion of the U.S. second proposal and will vote against this proposal.

At the same time, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to once again draw the Security Council's attention to the following extremely important situation.

In the process of the Security Council unilaterally considering the U.S. delegation's proposal, the U.S. government, as in every previous discussion of the use of bacteriological weapons, continues to refuse to condemn bacteriological warfare. The only explanation for this action is that the U.S. wants to be able to blatantly use the shameful bacteriological weapons in the future as well. This is clearly the reason why the U.S. government stubbornly opposes the Soviet proposal to call on countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol, and it is also the reason why the U.S. government refuses to ratify this protocol.

### 马立克在七月八日安理会上的发言全文

1952-07-12
第4版()
专栏：

    马立克在七月八日安理会上的发言全文
    关于美国代表向安全理事会提出的第二个提案，苏联代表团认为有必要从着手讨论美国新提案的时候，就再度促请安全理事会注意一个事实：讨论美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题，如果没有朝中两国代表参加，就不仅是非法的，而且是无从了解事实真相的。
    朝中政府和国际民主组织的文件完全证实美军使用细菌武器罪行
    安全理事会手头有许多无可辩驳地证实了美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的正式文件。联合国秘书处已收到了中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于这件事情的几次正式声明；它也收到了许多国际民主组织的函电。美国代表在发言里所引用的许多话都是从这些声明和正式文件里摘引来的，安全理事会的每一位代表都能从上述正式文件中研究所有这些事实。美国代表却把这些声明都无中生有地归之于苏联报纸和苏联电台。苏联报纸和电台不过是报道了中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表的上述正式文件中以及许多国际民主组织交给联合国的谈到美国武装部队对朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的情形的正式声明中所提出的事实。
    从这些正式文件中可以知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在其外务相朴宪永先生一九五二年二月二十二日的声明中列举了美国武装部队对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国使用细菌武器的许多具体事实。
    从这些文件中可以知道，中华人民共和国政府曾在其外交部长周恩来一九五二年三月八日的声明中，对美国政府使用细菌武器屠杀中国人民并派遣美机侵犯中国领土一节，提出严重抗议。中国中央人民政府的声明举出许多具体事实，说明美国武装部队今年二月和三月在中国东北对中国人民使用细菌武器的情形。
    声明说：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，美国政府为了要达到其扩大朝鲜战争、破坏远东和世界和平的目的，不仅在朝鲜对和平人民及朝中人民武装力量，使用了国际公约和人类道德所绝对禁止的细菌武器，甚至还扩大这种罪行，对中国东北的和平人民，也使用这一非法的细菌武器，来进行野蛮的挑衅。”
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永先生本年四月二十一日致联合国秘书长的电文中载有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这样的正式声明：世界舆论的许多公正代表，其中包括国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团以及苏联、中国、英国、法国和其他国家的新闻记者，已无可辩驳地证明了美国干涉军使用细菌武器。
    安全理事会所收到的关于这件事情的其他文件，还有国际民主法律工作者协会的一封公函。在这封公函内，附有两个报告：“关于美国在朝鲜的罪行的报告”和“关于美国军队在中国领土上使用细菌武器的报告。”这两个报告都是曾到朝鲜和中国调查使用细菌武器的事实的法律工作者调查团提出的。国际民主法律工作者协会致安理会的上述公函说：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会在研究了全部材料后特声明：它的调查团所揭露的这些事实证明，美军正在进行的滔天罪行不仅是针对着朝鲜军队，而且是针对着朝鲜的平民的。
    具体说来，这些罪行就是：使用化学武器、屠杀、拷打和暴行、空袭和平居民、抢掠和破坏财物和珍贵文物、特别应该强调的是这些军队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。
    这一切材料都已作为安全理事会的正式文件发表了，每个人都可以研究一下这些文件。这些文件中有着在朝美国军队对朝中人民使用细菌武器的无可辩驳的证据。
    这个驳不倒的证据揭露了美国政府向安全理事会提出挑衅地中伤和诽谤苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新提案的目的。我们必须坚决指出这个提案及其中的建议的挑衅性质。这个提案提出的建议显然是为了要分散世界舆论对于美国政府对朝中人民使用细菌武器的责任问题的注意。
    这个提案中提到侵朝美军司令部绝口否认使用细菌武器的话是不能令人信服的，是站不住脚的。美国政府固执地反对朝中人民代表参加安全理事会讨论美国军队对朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题，这暴露了美军司令部和美国政府绝口否认使用细菌武器的企图是完全没有根据的。
    美国所谓的红十字“国际”委员会是被用作美国政策工具的一群人
    至于美国提案中所提到的所谓红十字“国际”委员会，应该说明，中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的政府已正当地拒绝了由这个委员会来进行调查的建议，因为这个委员会不是一个国际组织而是被用作美国政策的工具的一群人。
    大家已经知道，这个为美国政府企图把它冒充为“客观的调查者”的所谓红十字“国际”委员会根本不是一个国际组织。它是瑞士一国的组织，虽然它用了所谓“红十字国际委员会”的名称。
    在第二次世界大战期间，这个委员会没有说过一句话，来保卫那些在希特勒匪徒占领的地区遭受他们的罪行之害的受难者。而事实上，却掩饰了希特勒匪徒的战争罪行，正像它现在为了取悦美国侵略者，而不声不响地掩饰他们在巨济岛对朝鲜和中国战俘的滔天罪行一样。
    自然，这样一个委员会，要像一个国际组织一样不抱着偏见工作，是不可能的。
    人们也都知道：这个委员会驻东京和朝鲜美军司令部的代表是莱纳，这个人在当初对希特勒集中营进行调查的时候说：里边一切都很好。
    因此，绝无理由期望一个已经声名狼藉，现在又打起“红十字国际委员会”招牌的机构能够有丝毫的客观。在行动上，这个委员会已经证明它自己是侵略朝鲜的美国人的帮凶和仆役。
    根据这些事实，大家现在看得明白：美国政府坚持它所提出的由上述委员会进行调查的提案，是企图阻挠中国和朝鲜代表参加安全理事会讨论美国军队对朝中人民使用细菌武器的问题。
    美国提案之毫无根据，也在美国想把问题提交世界卫生组织的企图上，得到证实。这种办法是毫无根据的，完全应该遭到最坚决的拒绝。
    安全理事会的档案中存有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于本年四月二十一日给联合国秘书长的复电，关于这个电报，我已提请安全理事会注意了。这封电报指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经防止了传染病的蔓延，并相信今后也必能粉碎敌人所制造的任何阴谋诡计，而且在民主国家的援助下，它具有和传染病及美国侵略者在朝鲜领土上撒布着的传染病菌的媒介物作斗争的办法，它不需要世界卫生组织这种组织的帮助。
    关于世界卫生组织本身，上述朴宪永的复电说：“如所周知，所谓世界卫生组织是毫无应有的国际威信的。因此朝鲜人民不能期待这一组织的援助。许多国家不是这一组织的成员。同时这一组织在执行摆在其面前的防止疾病和与它作斗争的任务中，多年来未进行过任何活动，所以从一九四九年起，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及其他一些国家宣告退出该组织，这也是人所共知的事实。”
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表朝鲜人民，表示希望联合国坚决谴责美国干涉者使用细菌武器的罪行以及他们违反国际法和人类道义原则的其他罪行，同时并再次要求联合国立即采取措施，制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的战争罪行。
    鉴于上述种种，可以明白看出，美国提案中把问题提交所谓世界卫生组织的主张，是毫无根据的，其唯一目的是要掩饰美国政府拒绝禁用细菌武器。
    美国拒绝邀请中朝代表参加讨论是破坏联合国宪章和惯例的行为
    鉴于从中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的官方声明中，以及从许多国际民主团体提交联合国与安全理事会的正式文件中所引证的上述事实，有必要在安理会特别着重指出，美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的事实，已经由权威的国际调查团证实，并且已经为全世界所周知。美国代表今天在发言中所引用的外国报纸上的话，证实了这一点。从这些话中可以看出，印尼和巴西知道了这些事情，意大利知道了这些事情，全世界各国都知道了这些事情。美国侵略者抹杀不了这些事实。利用中伤与捏造（有些是针对苏联的）来否认这些事实的企图，是注定要失败的。
    苏联代表团在其七月一日的声明中说明了它对美国代表团向安理会提出的提案的态度。苏联代表团要求安理会注意：美国提案的目的是要欺骗舆论，使人们不注意美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用被禁止的细菌武器的事实，掩饰美国政府拒绝批准一九二五年禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的行为。
    此外，美国又拒绝了苏联的提案，即联合国安全理事会讨论美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题时，应邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加。这样，美国就妨碍了联合国合法地即按照联合国宪章来研究这个问题，联合国宪章规定，凡研究一个问题时应有一切有关方面参加讨论。
    美国代表还提到裁减军备委员会，那也是完全说不过去的。在裁军委员会里，美国代表团及其大西洋侵略集团中的同伙曾经拒绝了苏联主张讨论这个问题的建议，而现在，在安全理事会，美国代表又歪曲真相，企图使人觉得苏联代表在裁军委员会里似乎并不建议邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表。但是，美国代表并没有提到在裁军委员会上没有机会提出这样的建议，因为苏联所提研究禁止细菌武器及惩办违反禁令者问题的建议，被美国代表及其北大西洋侵略集团中的同伙所否决了。
    事实真相就是这样。这说明美国代表在这里提出的论点是多么荒谬。此外，人人都晓得，安全理事会在讨论任何争执不决的问题时，一定邀请一切有关方面参加，这已经成了一个固定的惯例。这一点已在宪章第三十二条上明文规定；而且也列在安全理事会的议事规则里。根据上述事实看来，美国代表没有理由把裁军委员会讨论问题的程序和安全理事会讨论问题的程序相提并论。单是从这方面提出这问题，就足以揭露美国代表这里所提出的论点是十分荒谬，完全没有根据的。
    美国既然不能使安全理事会接受一项显然违背联合国宪章所规定的议事程序的决定，就再次试图悍然破坏宪章所规定的程序，强使安全理事会审议另
    一个非法的片面提案，这个提案显然是挑衅性的、诽谤性的。
    美国提出这个诽谤性提案的目的是掩饰其拒绝谴责细菌战的阴谋
    美国政府所以要提出这个提案，目的在于掩饰它自己拒绝斥责使用细菌武器与拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的行动，以便使舆论不注意美国政府对于禁止与斥责使用细菌武器所持的反对态度。
    美国代表无中生有地谈到了据说是由美国在联合国裁减军备委员会上提出的所谓裁减军备计划，他这种行动是不值一笑的，因为，安全理事会和全世界都知道，美国代表或他的英国或法国同伴们，根本没有在裁减军备委员会上提出过什么“裁减军备计划”来。美国在裁减军备委员会上的代表过去和现在都是，而且将来显然还要试图以关于搜集军备情报、而且仅仅是常规军备情报的提案，来代替关于裁减军备和武装部队并禁止原子武器和各种大规模毁灭武器（包括细菌武器在内）的问题。
    这个企图失败以后，英国和法国出来帮美国的忙。它们共同企图用一个分割出来的关于只确定武装部队的所谓“水平”的提案来代替裁减军备及武装部队和禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭武器的提案。这样的提案和裁减军备计划毫无共同之处，和裁减军备及武装部队以及禁止原子武器及其他各种大规模毁灭武器的提案也毫无共同之处；它们之间没有、也不可能有共同之处。美国代表在安全理事会上毫无根据地提到这些提案，这纯粹是欺骗宣传的手段，其目的在于掩饰美国政府拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，掩饰美国政府违反禁止细菌武器的规定。唯一真正的、包罗无遗的关于裁减军备及武装部队和禁止原子武器及其他各种大规模毁灭的武器的计划，已经提交给联合国裁减军备委员会了。这就是苏联提出的计划，但是美国政府顽固地拒绝这个计划。这都是人所共知的事实。
    基于上述理由，苏联代表团认为不可能参加关于美国第二个提案的讨论，并将投票反对这个提案。
    同时，苏联代表团认为有必要再度促请安全理事会注意下列极端重要的情况。
    在安全理事会片面地审议美国代表团的提案的过程中，美国政府和从前每次讨论使用细菌武器问题时一样，仍然拒绝谴责细菌战。对这种行动的唯一解释就是美国想在将来也能够放肆地使用可耻的细菌武器。这显然就是美国政府顽固地反对苏联关于号召各国参加并批准日内瓦议定书的建议的原因，也是美国政府拒绝批准这个议定书的原因。
