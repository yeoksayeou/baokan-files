    Southwest Industrial Department No. 103 Factory
    Review of the Reasons for Waste in Repair and Construction Projects

    Editor,

    We believe that the criticism of our factory's Basic Construction Section by Comrade Wang Xiyi, published in the People's Daily on May 8th, regarding waste in repair and construction projects due to inadequate planning, is correct. We now offer the following review of this matter:

    We did not conduct sufficient prior investigation and research, which led to changes in plans midstream and delayed commencement. As a result, raw materials that were originally stored separately had to be transported again, increasing raw material handling costs and causing waste. We are determined to correct the errors of the past and will, in the future, conduct investigation, research, and design work in full accordance with the Interim Measures for Basic Construction promulgated by the Central Government.

    In the past, we held conservative ideas about basic construction work and lacked a clear understanding of how to seize the time to complete basic construction tasks and coordinate with production. In the future, we should seize the time and proactively solve problems.

    In the past, our understanding of basic construction work was vague, and we thought of it as temporary work. Therefore, the organization of our Basic Construction Section was not sound enough, and there were chaotic phenomena and a lack of discipline and planning in our work. In the future, we should correct this incorrect view ideologically, improve the organization, and strictly implement the system.

### 西南工业部一○三厂  检讨造成修造工程浪费的原因

    西南工业部一○三厂
    检讨造成修造工程浪费的原因
    编辑同志：五月八日人民日报刊登汪洗遗同志批评我厂基本建设科因计划不周而造成修造工程浪费一事，我们认为是对的。现在我们对这件事作如下的检讨：
    我们事先调查研究工作做得不够，中途变更计划，延期开工；原来分别存放的原料，也因此要再次搬运，增加了原料搬运费用，造成浪费。我们决心纠正过去的错误，今后全力按照中央颁布的基本建设暂行办法进行调查研究和设计工作。
    我们过去对基本建设工作存在着保守思想，没有明确认识如何争取时间完成基本建设任务，配合生产；今后应当抓紧时间主动解决问题。
    过去，我们对基本建设工作认识模糊，以为它是临时性的工作，所以我们基本建设科的组织不够健全，工作上存在着纷乱现象，缺乏纪律性和计划性。今后应该在思想上纠正这种不正确的看法，健全组织，严格执行制度。
    西南工业部第一○三厂
