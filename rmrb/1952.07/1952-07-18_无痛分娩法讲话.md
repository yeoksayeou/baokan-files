Speech on Painless Childbirth Method

Lecture 3: The Three Stages of Labor

A woman's labor can generally be explained in three stages.

The first stage (dilation stage): the period from the beginning of labor to the full dilation of the external os of the uterus.

The main phenomenon of the dilation stage is the enlargement of the cervix, and the contraction of the uterine muscles is the main force for opening the cervix. The cervix does not open all at once; it takes several hours. If it were stretched open all at once, it might cause pain because the cervix's ability to expand cannot adapt immediately. This shows that the cervix's expansion is gradually being trained. At the beginning, contractions occur every ten to fifteen minutes, each lasting thirty to forty seconds. Towards the end of the dilation stage, contractions occur every two to three minutes, each lasting a minute or more. When the painless childbirth method is not used, women generally feel pain in waves at this time. Therefore, this phenomenon was previously called "labor pains." However, after implementing the painless childbirth method, women only feel a wave of hardening or, at most, some backache, without any pain. The intrauterine pressure caused by uterine contractions attempts to push the fetus out in the direction of the least resistance, the cervix. Therefore, part of the amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid forms the amniotic sac, and the amniotic sac gradually opens the cervix. According to the painless childbirth method, childbirth guidance during the dilation stage is a crucial part of success. During the dilation stage, the woman is not allowed to actively participate in the labor movement but is told to wait quietly for the cervix to dilate. Previously, women did not understand the progression of labor. At the same time, the time required for the dilation stage is relatively long, sometimes from twelve to twenty-four hours or even longer, so women may show anxiety, impatience, and even moaning or shouting.

On the part of doctors or midwives, because of the mistaken belief that the dilation stage is a safe period, they often become negligent in their work and do not pay attention to caring for the patient, which can easily promote the appearance of pain. It is necessary to fully care for the woman, carefully give examinations, and provide practical and caring nursing to achieve the real purpose of safety.

When the cervix is fully dilated, uterine contractions become stronger, the duration is prolonged, and the intrauterine pressure of the amniotic sac also increases until it ruptures, and the amniotic fluid flows out. We call this phenomenon "water breaking," which generally occurs at the end of the dilation stage.

During the dilation stage, the birth attendant must frequently check the general condition of the mother and fetus and tell the woman the results of the examination. Pay attention to whether there are any abnormal phenomena; if there are abnormal phenomena, the birth attendant should not panic, give the woman more encouragement and comfort, help the woman massage uncomfortable areas, and repeatedly tell them how to actively participate in labor activities in the next stage of labor (expulsion stage) and how to cooperate with the birth attendant.

We all know that massage can make people feel comfortable. The birth attendant should apply massage to the labor process to eliminate uncomfortable feelings for the woman.

The second stage (expulsion stage): from the complete dilation of the external os of the uterus to the delivery of the fetus. After the cervix is fully dilated and the water breaks, the part of the fetus at the lowest part of the pelvis (such as the head in the case of a cephalic presentation), the so-called "presenting part," begins to move forward or descend very actively. The driving force behind this movement is mainly uterine contractions and the strengthening of abdominal pressure. The strengthening of abdominal pressure is mainly the contraction of the abdominal muscles and the tension and descent of the diaphragm. However, tension throughout the body can strengthen abdominal pressure even more, such as clenching fists, closing the mouth tightly, and fully contracting the muscles of the upper limbs and face. In rural areas, many women adopt a squatting posture during childbirth and are not accustomed to lying down to give birth. They feel that they cannot exert force when lying down. We believe that squatting to give birth is dangerous because the force of abdominal pressure is very strong when squatting to give birth. If one exerts force, it is easy to compress the fetus and tear the vagina because the adaptability of the vaginal opening has not yet been trained.

At this time, it is not enough to rely solely on strong uterine contractions and greatly increased abdominal pressure to deliver the child. The vagina also needs to expand to a certain extent. The expansion of the vagina is gradually stretched open as the fetus descends. When the fetus stretches open the vagina, the midwife should tell the woman to relax the muscles of the perineum and not make the perineal muscles tense. Although the expandability of the vagina can ensure the smooth passage of the fetus, in order to ensure that the mother does not suffer during this time, the fetus itself also undergoes adaptive changes. For example, during strong uterine contractions, the fetus's spine changes from a curved state to an extended posture consistent with the uterine axis, which provides favorable conditions for smooth delivery. Secondly, because there are large or small fissures between each bone of the fetus's skull, when the fetus's head passes through the relatively narrow birth canal, it may reduce the size of the head. Again, in order not to damage the mother's body, a fetus larger than the vagina can change several positions when passing through the birth canal. The fetus's changing positions is very beneficial for delivery, just like moving a large table through a small door, we must find ways to change the orientation to move it through smoothly.

The main phenomenon of the expulsion stage is the delivery of the fetus. At this time, the woman should consciously use abdominal pressure and relax the perineal muscles. The main task of the birth attendant during the expulsion stage is to guide the woman in using abdominal pressure, how to use the handrails of the delivery bed to increase abdominal pressure, and to cooperate with perineal protection. During the interval between uterine contractions, the birth attendant should comfort and care for the woman well, so they can fully rest and prepare their strength to use it in the next abdominal pressure.

During the expulsion stage, the fetus is subjected to very severe pressure and compression. It can only pass through the birth canal after complex mechanisms. Therefore, the birth attendant should carefully pay attention to the fetus's condition and inform the woman of the progress of the baby's head at any time.

Old drug anesthesia methods are mostly implemented during this period. We know that if the anesthesia is used too early, it will affect uterine contractions and the expansion of the birth canal opening; if it is used too late, it will not achieve the purpose of eliminating pain, but it is also dangerous for the fetus. Implementing this method not only requires expensive drugs, but it can only be implemented in well-equipped large hospitals.

The third stage (placental stage): This period is the stage of placental separation and expulsion. Under normal circumstances, after the fetus is delivered, the woman and the birth attendant feel a sense of relief. If the birth attendant is careless at this time, accidents often occur. Therefore, after the fetus is delivered, tell the mother that the placenta is still in the uterus and that labor is not over; or tell them to pay close attention to their uterus. The mother can tell the birth attendant at any time when postpartum uterine contractions begin.

Based on the above analysis, pregnancy and childbirth are natural phenomena, and there should be no pain. (End of this lecture, to be continued)

    无痛分娩法讲话

    第三讲分娩的三个阶段
    妇女分娩经过一般可分为三个阶段来加以说明。
    第一期（开口期）：自分娩开始到外子宫口开全的期间。
    开口期的主要现象是子宫口开大，而子宫筋的收缩是开大子宫口的主要力量。子宫口不是一下就撑开的，需要经过好几个钟头。假若一下子被撑开，这可能引起疼痛，因为子宫口的扩张性不能一下子适应上去。这说明子宫口的扩张性是逐渐在锻炼着的。在开始时，每十至十五分钟发作一次，每次持续三十到四十秒。到开口期末尾，二、三分钟就收缩一次，每次持续一分钟或一分钟以上。不实行无痛分娩法时，产妇在这时普遍觉得一阵一阵的痛。所以在以前把这种现象叫做“阵痛”。但实行无痛分娩法后，产妇们只是一阵一阵地有硬的感觉，或者顶多有一些腰酸，不会有疼痛发生。由子宫收缩所引起的子宫内压，向抵抗力最小的子宫口方向，企图将胎儿压出，所以一部分卵膜和羊水就形成了卵胞，由卵胞的作用，逐渐开大子宫口。按无痛分娩法说，开口期的分娩指导是成功的重要环节。在开口期不准许产妇主动地参加分娩动作，叫她们安静地等候子宫口开大。以前产妇们是不了解分娩的进行状态的，同时开口期所需要的时间比较长，有时从十二小时到二十四小时或是更长些，所以产妇在这时可能表现不安、焦躁，以至呻吟或大声喊叫。
    在大夫或助产士方面，因为误信开口期是个安全期，往往对工作麻痹大意，不注意照顾病人，这样就很容易促进疼痛的出现。必须充分地照顾产妇，慎重地给予检查以及切实而亲切的护理，才能达到真正安全的目的。
    子宫口全开大时，子宫的收缩更加增强，持续的时间延长，卵胞的内压也增高以至破裂，前羊水流出。我们把这个现象叫作“破水”，它一般发生在开口期的末尾。
    在开口期，助产者必须经常检查母体和胎儿的一般状态，并把检查的结果告诉产妇。注意有无异常的现象发生；如有异常的现象，助产者不要慌张，多给产妇们一些鼓励和安慰，帮助产妇按摩不舒服的地方，并要反复地告诉她们在下一产程（排出期）怎样主动地参加分娩活动，如何和助产者合作。
    我们都知道，按摩能使人感到舒服，助产者要把按摩应用到分娩过程中去，使产妇消除不舒服的感觉。
    第二期（分娩期）：自外子宫口完全开大到胎儿娩出。子宫口开全，破水以后，在骨盘部最下方的胎儿部分（如在头位时是儿头）即所谓“先进部”开始很活泼地前进或下降。支配这个运动的原动力，最重要的是子宫的收缩及腹压的加强。腹压的加强主要是腹筋收缩和横隔膜紧张下降，但是，全身肌肉紧张，更能使腹压加强，如握紧拳、闭紧了嘴、上肢和颜面筋完全收缩等。在乡村里，很多产妇在分娩时采取蹲着的姿势，而不习惯于躺着生孩子。她们觉得躺着使不上劲。我们认为，蹲着生孩子是有危险的，原因是在蹲着生孩子时，腹压的力量很大，如果一使劲，很容易将胎儿压迫出来，把阴道撕裂，因为这时阴道口的适应性还没有锻炼好。
    在这时要想把小孩子生出来，仅仅依靠子宫的大力收缩和大力加强腹压这两个条件是不够的，还需要阴道扩大到一定程度才行。阴道的扩大，是在胎儿下降时逐渐撑开的。胎儿撑开阴道时，助产士应当告诉产妇放松阴部的肌肉，不要把阴部肌肉弄得很紧张。阴道的扩大性虽然可以保证胎儿顺利通过，但为了保证母亲在这时不遭受痛苦，胎儿本身也发生适应变化。例如在子宫大力收缩时，胎儿的脊椎骨由曲屈状态变成与子宫轴一致的伸展姿势，这样，就给顺利的分娩提供了有利条件。其次，因为胎儿每块头骨中间都有或大或小的裂缝，这样，当胎儿的头部在通过比较狭窄的产道时，就可能把头的体积变小。再次，比阴道大的胎儿，为了不损伤母亲的机体，当通过产道时，可变换几个体位，胎儿的变换体位，对分娩是很有好处的，就好像我们搬一个大桌子进小门一样，我们必须设法变换方位，才能顺利地搬过去。
    娩出期的主要现象是娩出胎儿。这时产妇要有意识地运用腹压，放松会阴部肌肉。助产者在娩出期的主要工作就是指导产妇运用腹压，和如何利用产床拉手以便于增加腹压，和配合保护会阴术。在子宫收缩间歇期，要好好地安慰产妇，照顾她们，要她们充分地休息，准备力量把它用在下次腹压上。
    在娩出期，胎儿受到很严重的压力和压迫。经过复杂的机转，才能通过产道。因此助产者应该细心地注意胎儿的状态，随时把婴儿头部的进行状态告知产妇。
    旧的药物麻醉法，多在这一时期实行。我们知道，如果麻醉法使用的早了，会影响子宫的收缩和产道口的扩大；使用的晚了，就不能达到消除疼痛的目的，但它对胎儿也有危险。实行这种方法，不但需要高价的药品，并且只有在设备好的大医院才能实行。
    第三期（后产期）：这个时期是胎盘的剥离娩出期。在一般状况下，胎儿娩出后，产妇和助产者都感到一阵轻松。在这时助产者如果不小心，常发生意外。所以在胎儿娩出后，告诉母亲胎盘仍在子宫内，分娩还没完了；或者叫她们好好注意自己的子宫。而母亲则可随时告诉助产者何时开始后产期子宫收缩。
    根据以上的分析，妊娠和分娩是自然的现象，绝不应该发生疼痛。    （本讲完，全文未完）
