    It is Necessary to Systematically Study the Basic Knowledge of Marxism-Leninism
    Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin taught us that theory is of utmost importance to revolutionary practice; Comrade Mao Zedong has also repeatedly taught us this.
    However, the long period of intense revolutionary struggle, especially the long period of armed struggle, has left many of our revolutionary cadres lacking the opportunity to systematically study theory. Only a small number of cadres are able to leave their posts and go to school to study. Although theoretical study for cadres in service has also played a certain role, due to busy work and other difficulties, this study is often in an unsatisfactory state of being intermittent, without a fixed curriculum or system. Therefore, the majority of our cadres still lack sufficient theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.
    The great "Three-Anti" movement has exposed many shortcomings and errors in the work of various departments, making many cadres deeply feel that their political theory study is insufficient. Moreover, we are now facing great economic construction, and in the future, national and social life will undergo more changes with the advancement of economic construction, and new things will appear frequently. In order to enable us to victoriously meet the new historical tasks, we must use effective methods to gradually overcome the shortcomings of cadres lacking theoretical knowledge. Therefore, strengthening theoretical study, systematically studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, and establishing a regular learning system in a step-by-step manner, has become an important task at present.
    Some people say: "Now that the revolution has achieved victory, and we are going to carry out economic construction, what is the importance of studying theory or not?" This statement actually mistakenly regards the future tasks of struggle as very simple and easy. The fact is just the opposite. Chairman Mao has long told us that we have only completed the first step of a ten-thousand-mile long march. The tasks before us are very serious and complex. For example, how should we unite all peace-loving forces in the world to expose and defeat the criminal plans of the American imperialists to create war in the future? How can we solve the various complex and difficult new problems that will arise in the process of construction, such as what will be the path of national industrialization and agricultural socialization? What changes and developments will take place in various economic components and social classes in the future? How to formulate economic plans? If our cadres cannot solve these problems, or even do not understand these problems at all, how can we move forward? In order to enable us to identify the direction and avoid detours in the complex struggles ahead, and in order to improve our ability to determine policies in practical work, we must better study the theory of Marxism-Leninism. The erroneous view of negating the importance of theoretical study must be corrected.
    "Why should the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism be studied systematically?" This is because although many cadres have learned some theory in the past and have some common political knowledge, they mostly have only some scattered knowledge of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. In order to truly possess the foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory, it is necessary to spend a considerable amount of time in the future to systematically study several basic courses (first of all, elementary political common sense, then modern Chinese history, modern world history, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, the history of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union, and the history of the Chinese Communist Party, etc.), step by step. If this is not done, a general improvement in theoretical level is impossible.
    "Will systematically studying theory lead to detachment from reality?" When we study Marxist-Leninist theory, if we do not earnestly understand its essence and content but only recite words and phrases, if we do not study the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong in researching and solving various practical problems in connection with concrete historical reality, but only satisfy ourselves with being familiar with certain theoretical conclusions, then we will naturally go astray and become detached from reality. Conversely, there is no need to fear detachment from reality. The combination of theory and practice is our basic principle of learning; this principle cannot be understood to mean that every step in the process of learning basic theory must be directly related to the current practical work. Marxism-Leninism is scientific theoretical knowledge, and therefore it has its own systematicness. If we completely disregard this systematicness, we cannot truly grasp Marxist-Leninist theory. If all learning is limited to starting from the current specific work, and the current work is constantly changing, then it will never be possible to have any systematic theoretical study. In practical work, we often have to seek theoretical help in order to solve a specific work problem, and it is right to do so, but when we still lack systematic basic theoretical knowledge, we must never be satisfied with the knowledge obtained in such a piecemeal manner. The purpose of systematically studying theory is to arm ourselves with Marxist-Leninist theoretical knowledge, so that we can improve our position, viewpoints, and methods, that is, to improve our ability to independently solve various practical problems. The effectiveness of theoretical study often becomes apparent only after a long period of time, and it should not be demanded too impatiently. (In addition, every cadre participating in theoretical study should also participate in the study of current events and policies, and this kind of study should naturally be closely related to current work or movements.)
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War": "Our task is to lead a large nation of hundreds of millions of people in an unprecedented and great struggle. Therefore, the task of studying the theory of Marxism-Leninism universally and deeply is a major problem that needs to be solved urgently and must be focused on for us. I hope that after this Central Committee plenary session, there will be a party-wide learning competition to see who has really learned something, who has learned a little more, and a little better." Although Comrade Mao Zedong's call was made under completely different circumstances from the present, we must still read it repeatedly to strengthen our determination to study theory.

### 必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识

    必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林教导我们，理论对于革命实践具有极重要的意义；毛泽东同志也曾经屡次这样地教导过我们。
    但是，长时期的紧张的革命斗争，特别是长时期的武装斗争，使得我们许多革命干部缺少系统地学习理论的机会。能够离职进学校去学习的干部只是很少数。在职干部的理论学习虽然也起了一定的作用，但由于工作繁忙和其它的困难，这种学习经常是处在时断时续、无一定课程和制度的不能令人满意的状态中。因此，我们的多数干部还缺少足够的马克思列宁主义的理论知识。
    伟大的“三反”运动揭露出各部工作的不少缺点和错误，使得许多干部痛切感到自己政治理论学习的不够。而且，现在我们正面临着伟大的经济建设，今后国家和社会生活将随着经济建设的前进而发生更多的变化，经常有新的事物出现。为了使我们能够胜利地迎接新的历史任务，就必须用有效的办法逐步地克服干部缺少理论知识的缺陷。因此，加强理论学习，系统地学习马克思列宁主义，学习马克思列宁主义和中国革命实际相结合的毛泽东思想，有步骤地建立起正规的学习制度，就成为当前重要的课题了。
    有人说：“现在革命已经取得了胜利，今后进行经济建设，学不学理论又有什么要紧呢？”这种说法，实际上是错误地把今后的斗争任务看得很简单很轻易。事实却正相反，毛主席早就告诉我们，我们现在不过是万里长征才走完了第一步。摆在我们面前的任务是十分严重和复杂的。例如，今后我们应该如何团结世界上一切爱好和平的力量来揭露和击败美帝国主义者制造战争的罪恶计划呢？我们又如何解决建设过程中将要发生的各种复杂和困难的新问题，像国家工业化和农业社会化的道路将是怎样的呢？各种经济成分和各社会阶级今后会有什么变化和发展呢？如何制订经济计划呢？如果我们干部不能解决这些问题，甚至根本不理解这些问题，我们又怎能前进呢？为了使我们在今后曲折复杂的斗争中辨明方向不走弯路，为了提高我们在实际工作中确定方针的能力，就必须更好地学习马克思列宁主义的理论。各种否认理论学习的重要性的错误观点必须纠正。
    “学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识为什么要系统地进行呢？”这是因为很多干部过去虽也多少学过一些理论，具有若干政治常识，但对马克思列宁主义的基本理论多半还只有一些零星散乱的知识。为了确实具备马克思列宁主义理论的基础，就必须在今后花费相当长的时间，有系统地把若干基本课程（首先是初级政治常识，然后是中国近代史、世界近代史、辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、政治经济学、联共（布）党史、中共党史等基本课程），循序渐进，一样样地进行学习。如果不这样作，理论水平的普遍提高是不可能的。
    “系统地学习理论，会不会脱离实际呢？”在我们学习马克思列宁主义的理论时，如果不是认真地体会其实质和内容而只是背诵词句，如果不是联系具体的历史实际学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志在研究和解决各种实际问题时的立场观点和方法，而只是以熟悉某些理论的结论为满足，那自然会走入脱离实际的歧路的。反之就无须害怕脱离实际。理论和实际结合，这是我们学习的基本原则；这个原则不能被理解为在学习基本理论的进程中每一步骤都必须和当前的实际工作直接相联系。马克思列宁主义是科学的理论知识，因而有它自己的系统性。完全不顾这种系统性，我们就不可能真正掌握马克思列宁主义理论。如果一切学习都被限制在从当前具体工作出发，而当前工作又是常常变化的，那就始终不可能有什么系统的理论学习了。在实际工作中，我们固然常常要为了解决某一个具体工作问题而去寻求理论的帮助，这样做是对的，但当我们还缺乏有系统的基本理论知识时，决不能以这样零碎取得的知识为满足。系统地学习理论的目的，是用马克思列宁主义的理论知识把我们武装起来，使我们在立场、观点、方法都能够提高，也就是使我们独立地解决各种实际问题的能力能够提高。理论学习的成效往往要在进行了较长时期之后才能显出，不应该过于急性地来要求它。（此外，每一参加理论学习的干部还要参加时事政策的学习，这种学习自然应该是和当前工作或运动密切相联系的。）
    毛泽东同志在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”一文中指出：“我们的任务，是领导一个几万万人口的大民族，进行空前的伟大的斗争。所以，普遍地深入地研究马克思列宁主义的理论的任务，对于我们，是一个亟待解决并须着重地致力才能解决的大问题。我希望从我们这次中央全会之后，来一个全党的学习竞赛，看谁真正地学到了一点东西，看谁学的更多一点，更好一点。”毛泽东同志的这一号召，虽然是在和现在完全不同的情况下提出的，可是，仍须我们反复诵读，以加强我们学习理论的决心。
