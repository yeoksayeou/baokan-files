The theoretical study of cadres in the Northeast region has achieved considerable success over the past year. Especially after the eight-month-long "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, not only have the political consciousness and ideological level of cadres been greatly improved, but also their awareness and enthusiasm for theoretical study have been greatly enhanced, which has created favorable conditions for further carrying out systematic theoretical study in the future.

Before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau, a relatively systematic and regular theoretical study system had been established in various parts of the Northeast. According to the different levels and needs of cadres, studies were conducted separately on "A Reader on the Chinese Revolution," "A Concise History of the Chinese Communist Party," "A History of the Modern Chinese Revolution," "The History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "A Brief History of Lenin's Life and Career," "A Short Biography of Stalin," "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," and "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction"; senior cadres focused more on studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." In order to effectively carry out these studies, nearly a hundred amateur political schools (night party schools) were organized in various parts of the Northeast. Statistics from only five provinces and cities, including Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Jilin, Benxi, and Heilongjiang, show that approximately 70,000 cadres participated in the study at these schools. In order to train teachers and instructors for the theoretical study of in-service cadres, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau and most provinces and cities held research classes for teachers of theoretical common knowledge and similar short-term teacher training classes; the Party School of the Northeast Bureau and some provincial and municipal Party Schools also had special training classes. In addition, in most provinces and cities, some leading party and government cadres were hired as theoretical teachers and instructors.

Closely coordinated with the above political theory studies, cadres were also universally organized to study the important policies and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, as well as Comrade Gao Gang's report on "Consolidating National Defense and Developing the Economy," the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries," Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," and the Northeast Bureau's documents on increasing production and practicing economy and opposing corruption, degeneration, and bureaucracy; senior cadres also conducted more in-depth research on Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical masterpiece "On Practice."

As a result of the above studies, most comrades have gained a preliminary understanding of the laws of social development and the laws of the development of the Chinese revolution, especially a deeper understanding of Comrade Mao Zedong's great achievements and correct thinking in leading the Chinese revolution. Many cadres who had just started working also initially established a revolutionary outlook on life, and the enthusiasm of most comrades for their work has increased.

During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, in order to improve cadres' understanding of the movements, in addition to educating cadres with the vivid facts exposed in the movements, various parts of the Northeast also universally organized cadres (especially middle and senior-level cadres) to study Mao Zedong's writings on the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the Party's policy toward the national bourgeoisie, Comrade Zhou Enlai's report (summary) at the Standing Committee meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on January 5, Comrade Gao Gang's report on "Overcoming the Erosion of Bourgeois Ideology on the Party and Opposing Right-leaning Ideology within the Party," and Comrade Chen Boda's "Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Comrade Stalin's Great Work 'The Question of the Chinese Revolution,'" and other documents. Through these studies, the broad masses of cadres drew a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie.

In order to consolidate the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and to adapt to the needs of large-scale economic construction in the future, the Northeast Bureau is leading various regions to restore and establish a regular and systematic system of political and theoretical study. First of all, the study of "On Contradiction" has begun among responsible cadres at the Northeast level and above the provincial and municipal Party committees. Under the personal leadership of Comrade Gao Gang, all members of the Northeast Bureau formed a study group on "On Contradiction" and absorbed responsible comrades from various departments and committees to participate. The various departments and committees at the Northeast Bureau level and most provincial and municipal Party committees have also organized study groups on "On Contradiction" to hold regular discussions.

    东北区一年来的干部理论学习
    一年来东北区的在职干部理论学习获得了不少成绩。特别经过八个多月的“三反”“五反”运动，不仅干部的政治觉悟和思想水平有了极大的提高，同时，干部对于理论学习的自觉性和积极性也大大提高了，这就为今后进一步开展系统的理论学习创造了有利条件。
    “三反”“五反”运动以前，在东北局的领导下，东北各地曾建立了比较系统的正规的理论学习制度。根据干部不同的水平和需要，各地曾分别进行了“中国革命读本”、“中国共产党简史”、“中国近代革命史”、“社会发展史”、“政治经济学”、“列宁生平事业简史”、“斯大林传略”、“联共（布）党史简明教程”及“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”的学习；高级干部更着重学习了“毛泽东选集”。为了有效地进行这些学习，东北各地曾组织了近百处的业余政治学校（夜间党校），仅沈阳、旅大、吉林、本溪、黑龙江等五省市统计，参加这种学校学习的干部约达七万人。为了培养在职干部学习的教员和辅导员，东北局宣传部及多数省市曾举办了理论常识教员研究班和与此类似的短期教员训练班；东北局党校和某些省市党校并设有专修班。此外，在大多数省市中，还聘请了一部分党政负责干部担任理论教员和辅导员。
    和上述政治理论学习紧密配合的，又普遍地组织干部学习了毛主席和党中央的重要政策和指示，以及高岗同志关于“巩固国防发展经济”的报告、中华人民共和国“惩治反革命条例”、胡乔木同志的“中国共产党的三十年”及东北局关于增产节约和反贪污蜕化反官僚主义的文件；高级干部并对毛泽东同志的哲学名著“实践论”进行了较深入的研究。
    由于进行了以上的学习，大多数同志都初步了解了社会发展的规律及中国革命的发展规律，特别是对毛泽东同志领导中国革命的伟大功绩和正确思想有了更深的体会。许多参加工作不久的干部也初步确立了革命的人生观，大多数同志的工作积极性提高了。
    在“三反”“五反”运动中，为了提高干部对“三反”“五反”运动的认识，东北各地除了以运动中所暴露的生动事实教育干部外，还普遍组织干部（特别是中、上级干部）学习了毛泽东同志关于中国民族资产阶级的论著及党对民族资产阶级的政策、周恩来同志一月五日在人民政协全国委员会常务委员会议上的报告（摘要）、高岗同志关于“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”的报告及陈伯达同志“纪念斯大林同志的伟大著作‘中国革命问题’的二十五周年”等文件。经过这些学习，广大干部划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的界限。
    为了巩固“三反”“五反”的胜利，并适应今后大规模经济建设的要求，东北局正领导各地恢复和建立经常的系统的政治理论学习制度。首先在东北一级及各省、市委以上的负责干部中开始了“矛盾论”的学习。东北局全体委员在高岗同志亲自领导下，组成了“矛盾论”的学习小组，并吸收各部委负责同志参加。东北局一级各部委和多数省市委也已组织“矛盾论”的学习小组，定期进行讨论。
