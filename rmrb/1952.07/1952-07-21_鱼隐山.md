    Fish Hidden Mountain

    Fish Hidden Mountain in the East Battlefield stands out above countless steep mountains, known as the "King of Mountains." Its uniquely dangerous main peak—the 1277.1 high ground—is one of the highest commanding points on the hundreds of miles of the Korean front. Standing here and looking through a telescope, one can faintly see Mount Wusheng, east of Tieyuan, known as the "Tiger Position," alongside Fish Hidden Mountain; to the east, one can clearly see Mount Jiaqi, which once caused heavy losses to the enemy. Mount Jiaqi and Fish Hidden Mountain are two iron bolts on the east and west sides of the Wendeng Highway, tightly guarding the gateway to the eastern front.

    Fish Hidden Mountain is magnificent and majestic. In the early morning, the mountainside is surrounded by white clouds and thick fog; but the summit is shining with sunlight, and the green peaks are prominent. The heroic Chinese and Korean People's Army is guarding the majestic mountain positions in this area, striking at the invading enemy.

    Last October, the warriors of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were ordered to hold Fish Hidden Mountain. They grabbed onto the rattan vines and climbed the steep mountain walls of more than seventy degrees to reach the peak. The mountains were covered with primeval forests, and the soldiers opened roads with axes and saws while advancing. At that time, the enemy used eight planes to bomb and strafe them, and the forest caught fire. The soldiers rolled to extinguish the flames on their bodies and continued to climb to the top of the mountain, throwing themselves into the heroic battle to defend Fish Hidden Mountain. That evening, the commander decided to adopt the tactic of "using attack to achieve the purpose of defense," and used a platoon to counterattack the 1089.6 high ground south of the mountain top. The soldiers attacked bravely under the cover of artillery fire, and after a night of fierce fighting, wiped out the entire First Company of the puppet army's Tenth Regiment, seizing the enemy's foothold for attacking the main peak of Fish Hidden Mountain. At dawn the next day, the enemy frantically counterattacked with a battalion of troops. The warriors used the bomb craters on the top of the mountain to carry out a strong resistance. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Guoxiang led a squad to fight the enemy on the front line. He was wounded in his left arm, but he remained calm and commanded the battle. Later, his right eye was shot blind, so he held his wound with one hand and fired his gun with the other to meet the enemy. Later, his right leg was broken, so he sat on the ground and insisted on fighting. He led his comrades to repel eight enemy assaults in a row with hand grenades. In this day's battle, the soldiers annihilated more than 300 enemies. Although the enemy's dirty blood stained the white stones on the mountain purple, it could not occupy the positions held by our warriors. That night, the soldiers took advantage of the victory to launch a counterattack on the two unnamed highlands in front of the 1089.6 high ground, and again victoriously annihilated the enemy. They fought continuously for six days and six nights, causing the puppet army's Tenth Regiment to suffer more than 800 casualties.

    Every mountain in the Fish Hidden Mountain area is a steel fortress. On the 938.2 high ground, known as "Hero Mountain," Special-Class People's Hero Gao Chengshan once led a company in a bloody battle for five days and four nights, defeating the enemy's frantic attack by two regiments and annihilating more than 1,800 enemies, thus the company won the glorious title of "Gao Chengshan Hero Company." On this position, the heroes fought more than 1,100 battles in eight months, killing and wounding more than 44,000 enemies.

    The American aggressors, at the end of their rope, had taken all kinds of brutal measures on this line of positions: they dropped more than 20 gas bombs, spread germ-carrying poisonous insects and poisonous substances, fired more than 70,000 shells, and dispatched approximately 10,000 sorties of aircraft. But all this could not achieve their aim of trying to occupy Fish Hidden Mountain. Last year, when Van Fleet launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive," the enemy concentrated more than 190 tanks here, and carried out the so-called "tank penetration battle" with the cooperation of many aircraft and artillery groups, attempting to "penetrate" Wonsan along the Wendeng Highway. The heroic soldiers rose up to meet the enemy's tank attack. In the first day of the battle, anti-tank hero Hu Lian destroyed four enemy tanks with artillery fire. Explosion hero Niu Ruisu led two soldiers to set up a minefield, destroying ten enemy tanks in eight days. Under the heroic and resourceful attacks of the soldiers, 135 enemy tanks were destroyed and damaged. Now, the remains of 68 tanks can still be seen in Wendengli. The heroic anti-aircraft gunners have also shot down and damaged 276 enemy planes in the Fish Hidden Mountain area.

    Like the entire Korean front, our army's defense line on Fish Hidden Mountain is very solid. The soldiers built strong fortifications on this line of positions. They used 854,900 workdays to turn every position into an indestructible and blast-resistant steel fortress. The soldiers, under the slogan of "building the army while fighting" and "turning the position into a training ground and the bunker into barracks," launched position training. At the same time, they also widely launched the sniper movement, using cold guns and cold cannons to kill and wound the enemy, so that the enemy dared not show their heads and huddled in their fortifications all day long. Soldier Tang Xiaoqing wrote a comic rhyme to sing about their position: "Fish Hidden Mountain is a university, the enemy's position is a shooting range, eliminating the enemy and training soldiers, the Volunteer Army is becoming stronger and stronger!" Recently, the enemy's attacks have become more frequent again. The heroes guarding Fish Hidden Mountain have shouted the battle cry of "Strive to annihilate more enemies and create a heroic unit of Fish Hidden Mountain!" preparing to give the enemy an even heavier blow.

    鱼隐山
    新华社记者  徐熊、徐孔
    东战场的鱼隐山突出在无数峻岭之上，号称“群山之王”。其奇险的主峰——一二七七点一高地，为朝鲜数百里战线上最高的制高点之一。站在这里用望远镜观看：向西隐隐可见在铁原以东和鱼隐山同称“猛虎阵地”的五圣山；向东能清晰地看到曾经使敌军受过惨重损失的加七峰。加七峰和鱼隐山是文登公路东西两侧的两把铁闩，紧紧地拱卫着东线的门户。
    鱼隐山壮丽雄伟，清晨，山腰间白云萦绕，浓雾弥漫；而山顶上却阳光辉耀，翠峰突现。英勇的中朝人民军队就守卫在这一带巍峨的山岭阵地上，打击着来犯的敌人。
    去年十月底，志愿军某部第三营的勇士们奉令坚守鱼隐山。他们抓住藤箩蔓草，从七十多度的陡峭山壁上攀登高峰。山上都是原始森林，战士们一面前进，一面用斧锯开辟道路。当时敌人用八架飞机向他们轰炸扫射，树林烧起大火。战士们滚灭身上的火焰，继续攀登山顶，投入坚守鱼隐山的英勇战斗。当天晚上，指挥员决定采取“用攻击达到防御目的”的战术手段，用一个排反击位于山头以南的一零八九点六高地。战士们在炮火的掩护下勇猛攻击，经过一夜激战，将守敌伪军第十团第一连全部歼灭，夺取了敌人进攻鱼隐山主峰的立足点。第二天黎明，敌人用一个营兵力疯狂反扑。勇士们利用山顶上的炸弹坑进行坚强阻击。副排长刘国祥带领一个班在最前沿和敌人拚杀。他左臂负伤了，仍然不动声色地指挥作战，后来他右眼被打瞎了，就用一只手按住伤口，用另一只手打枪迎击敌人，后来他的右腿被打断了，他就坐在地上坚持战斗。他带领战友们用手榴弹连续打退了敌人八次冲锋。在这天战斗中，战士们消灭了三百多个敌人。敌人的污血虽然将山上的白石染成了紫色，但不能占领我们勇士们坚守的阵地。当天晚上，战士们乘胜向一零八九点六高地前边的两个无名高地发起反击，又胜利地歼灭了敌人。他们连续战斗六天六晚，使伪军第十团伤亡了八百多人。
    鱼隐山一带的每一座山岭都是钢铁堡垒。在称为“英雄山”的九三八点二高地上，特级人民英雄高成山曾带领一个连血战五天四夜，打垮敌人两个团的疯狂进攻，歼敌一千八百多名，因而该连获得“高成山英雄连”的光荣称号。在这一带阵地上，英雄们在八个月中进行了一千一百多次战斗，杀伤敌人已达四万四千多名。
    日暮途穷的美国侵略者在这一线阵地上曾经采取过各种残暴手段：投过二十多枚毒气弹，撒过带菌的毒虫、毒物，发出过七万多发炮弹，出动过约一万架次的飞机。但是这一切都不能达到他们企图侵占鱼隐山的目的。去年范佛里特发动所谓“秋季攻势”时，敌军曾在这里集中了一百九十多辆战车，在许多飞机和炮群的配合下进行所谓“坦克劈入战”，企图沿文登公路“劈入”元山。英勇的战士们奋起迎击敌军的战车进攻。在第一天战斗中，反战车英雄胡连就用炮火击毁了敌人四辆战车。爆炸英雄牛瑞宿率领两个战士摆下地雷阵，八天中炸毁了敌人十辆战车。在战士们英勇机智的打击下，敌人战车被击毁击伤了一百三十五辆。现在在文登里还可以看到六十八辆战车的残骸。英勇的对空射击手们，也已经在鱼隐山一带击落击伤敌机二百七十六架。
    像整个朝鲜战线一样，我军在鱼隐山的防线是非常巩固的。战士们在这一线阵地修筑了强固的工事。他们用八十五万四千九百多个工，把每一处阵地变成了打不垮、炸不烂的钢铁堡垒。战士们在
    “一面战斗、一面建军”、“变阵地为操场、变碉堡为营房”的口号下，展开了阵地练兵。同时他们又广泛地展开了狙击运动，用冷枪冷炮杀伤敌人，打得敌人不敢露头，整天龟缩在工事里。战士唐小青写了一首快板歌唱他们的阵地道：“鱼隐山是个大学堂，敌人阵地是靶场，消灭敌人又练兵，志愿军越打越坚强！”最近，敌人的进攻又频繁起来了。守卫在鱼隐山上的英雄们已喊出了“争取歼灭更多的敌人，创造鱼隐山英雄部队！”的战斗口号，准备给予敌人更沉重的打击。
