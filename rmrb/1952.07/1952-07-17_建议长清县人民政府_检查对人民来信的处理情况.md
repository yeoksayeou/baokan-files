    Suggesting the Changqing County People's Government
    to Inspect the Handling of People's Letters

    Editor: From the beginning of January to the middle of May this year, the Changqing County People's Government in Shandong Province received a total of thirty-four letters from the people. These letters reflected various situations and offered many suggestions and criticisms regarding the implementation of the government's policies; especially during the "Three-Anti" campaign, these letters provided the government with a great deal of relevant material. However, the Changqing County People's Government has not been responsible enough in dealing with these letters. After these letters were forwarded by the General Office to the relevant departments, there was never any inspection of the results of the handling. For example, out of these thirty-four letters, nineteen were forwarded to the County People's Procuratorate for handling. The Procuratorate only conducted simple investigations and responses to two of them, while the remaining seventeen were backlogged. Letters forwarded to other departments were also backlogged. The masses have expressed dissatisfaction with this, believing that the government is not solving problems for the people. This shows that the leading cadres of the Changqing County People's Government have not given due attention to the people's letters, their mass viewpoint is still very weak, which has affected the relationship between the government and the people and failed to leverage the role of the people's letters.

    In addition to suggesting that the Changqing County People's Government inspect the work of handling people's letters, I would like to offer the following suggestions for reference in various places: First, governments at all levels should abide by the State Council's decision on handling people's letters and designate full-time personnel within the original establishment to be responsible for handling people's letters. Second, a regular system of urging and inspecting must be established for people's letters that are transferred to relevant departments for handling. Third, local people's governments should flexibly establish "Masses' Inquiry Offices" within the original establishment, and assign capable cadres to be responsible for receiving the masses.

    建议长清县人民政府
    检查对人民来信的处理情况
    编辑同志：自今年一月初到五月中旬，山东省长清县人民政府共收到人民来信三十四件。这些来信反映了各方面的情况，对人民政府各项政策的实施提出了不少的建议和批评；尤其在“三反”运动中，这些来信曾供给了政府许多有关材料。但长清县人民政府对待这些人民来信，是不够负责的。这些信，由秘书室转到有关部门以后，对处理的结果如何，从来没有检查。如在这三十四件来信中，转到县人民检察署处理的是十九件，该署除对其中两件作了简单的调查处理和答复外，其余十七件都被积压起来。转到其他部门的来信，也被积压起来了。对此，群众曾经表示不满，认为政府不给群众解决问题。这说明长清县人民政府领导干部对待人民来信没有给以应有的重视，群众观点还很薄弱，以致影响了政府和群众的关系，没有发挥人民来信的作用。
    我除建议长清县人民政府检查处理人民来信的工作外，特提出下列几点意见供各地参考：一、各级人民政府应遵照政务院关于处理人民来信的决定，在原编制内指定专人负责处理人民来信的工作。二、对转有关部门处理的人民来信，必须建立定期的催办、检查制度。三、各地人民政府在原编制内机动地设立“群众问事处”，抽调得力干部负责和群众接谈。
