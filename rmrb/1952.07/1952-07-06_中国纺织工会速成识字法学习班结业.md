    Graduation Ceremony of the Chinese Textile Workers' Trade Union Accelerated Literacy Class
    The first session of the Accelerated Literacy Class jointly sponsored by the National Committee of the Chinese Textile Workers' Trade Union and the Qingdao Municipal Textile Workers' Trade Union concluded on June 19th. The trainees from various regions have returned to their respective places after successfully completing their studies. This marks an important beginning for the large-scale promotion of the literacy campaign among the 600,000 textile workers across the country.
    The Accelerated Literacy Class commenced on May 13th. A total of 123 participants attended the class, including workers and amateur school teachers from various textile factories, textile machinery factories, and printing and dyeing factories in Qingdao, as well as textile workers, trade union cultural and educational cadres, and amateur school teachers from Northeast, Northwest, Central South, Shanghai, Subei, Jinan, Hangzhou, and other regions. The curriculum focused on accelerated literacy in conjunction with research on accelerated literacy teaching methods.
    The 58 textile workers who participated in the accelerated literacy program, through stages such as learning phonetic symbols, Pinyin, intensive vocabulary, reading, and writing, have improved from an average of 399 characters to an average of more than 2,400 characters each. Generally, they are now able to read popular reading materials and newspapers. During the learning process, the trainees adopted a combination of classroom lectures and mutual assistance learning methods, resulting in rapid progress. When the trainees overcame various learning difficulties and were able to read books and newspapers, they all felt the happiness of cultural emancipation. Liu Cuiying, a female worker from Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 5, said after reading the "Snowy Mountains and Grasslands" lesson in the workers' culture textbook: "Chairman Mao led the Red Army on the Long March, overcoming all kinds of difficulties and completing the 25,000-li Long March, which brought us today's happy life. We must not forget the benefits Chairman Mao has given us. After returning to the factory, we must vigorously promote the accelerated literacy method and work hard to produce and build a new China!"
    The ideological understanding of the cultural and educational cadres of trade unions and amateur school teachers from various regions who participated in the teaching research has also been significantly improved after learning. When they first entered the school, most of them had the idea of ​​"bringing a set of methods back," and many people still had various doubts about the accelerated literacy method. For example, some teachers said: "The method is good, but I think there are problems in promoting it among workers." This is because the teachers have not fully established the concept of serving the workers and lack a correct understanding of the accelerated literacy method. Therefore, the study class first explained the basic spirit and characteristics of the accelerated literacy teaching method to the teachers through ideological talks, symposiums, workers' cultural complaint meetings, and learning mobilization meetings, and emphasized that it is necessary to clearly establish the concept of serving the workers and peasants wholeheartedly ideologically in order to do a good job in the teaching and promotion of the accelerated literacy method. After the teachers' thinking was initially stabilized, they began to organize them to study relevant documents on the accelerated literacy method, visit actual teaching and participate in experimental teaching work, and hold various teaching seminars, discussions, and review meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism. This changed the teachers' various incorrect perceptions of the accelerated literacy method. The teachers criticized the old teaching concepts one after another. For example, Lin Xuejuan, a teacher at the Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 Amateur School, said: "In the past, I had a long-standing idea of ​​blindly worshiping experts. After Qi Jianhua's accelerated literacy method was announced, I looked down on him. I thought, he is not an expert, isn't it a mess to do this? After this study, I realized that to truly do a good job in the teaching of the accelerated literacy method, it is not a technical problem, but it must have the idea of ​​serving the people wholeheartedly!" The teachers in the Sunan area criticized the erroneous thinking of not being at ease with amateur education work and further realized the great significance of industrial and agricultural amateur education work to the country's economic construction, thus realizing the glory and importance of their responsibilities.
    At the graduation ceremony on June 19, all the trainees unanimously expressed that they would continue to work hard to promote the accelerated literacy method and strive to meet the cultural needs of the 600,000 textile workers across the country!

### 中国纺织工会速成识字法学习班结业

    中国纺织工会速成识字法学习班结业
    中国纺织工会全国委员会和青岛市纺织工会联合主办的中国纺织工会第一期速成识字法学习班，已于六月十九日结业。参加学习的各地学员在胜利完成学习任务后均已返回原地。这是在全国六十万纺织工人中大规模推行识字运动的一个重要开端。
    速成识字法学习班于五月十三日开学。参加学习的除青岛各纺织厂、纺织机械厂、印染厂的工人和业余学校教员外，还有东北、西北、中南和上海、苏北、济南、杭州等地区的纺织工人，工会文教干部和业余学校的教员等共一百二十三人。学习内容是速成识字结合速成识字教学研究。
    参加速成识字学习的五十八名纺织工人，通过学习注音符号、拼音、突击生字、阅读、写字写话等阶段，已由原来平均识三百九十九个字，提高到平均每人识二千四百多个字，一般地能够阅读通俗读物和报刊。在学习过程中，学员们采用课堂听讲和互助互学相结合的方法，进步很快。当学员们克服了种种学习上的困难，开始能看书读报的时候，都感到文化上翻身的幸福。青岛国棉五厂女工刘翠英读了工人文化课本中的“雪山草地”一课后说：“毛主席领导红军长征，克服种种困难，完成了两万五千里长征，给我们换来了今天的幸福生活，我们一定不忘毛主席给咱的好处，回厂后要好好地宣传速成识字法，并努力生产，建设新中国！”
    参加教学研究的各地工会文教干部和业余学校教员在学习以后，思想也有了显著的提高。他们在刚刚入学的时候，大部分存在着“搬一套回去”的想法，不少人还对速成识字法存在着种种疑虑。如有的教员说：“方法好是好，我看在工人中推行有问题”。这是由于教员们还没有完全树立为工人服务的观点和对速成识字法缺乏正确的理解。因此，学习班首先通过举行思想漫谈会、座谈会、工人文化诉苦会和学习动员会等，向教员们说明速成识字教学法的基本精神和特点，并强调说明：必须在思想上明确树立全心全意为工农服务的观点，才能做好速成识字法的教学和推广工作。在教员们思想初步稳定后，便开始组织他们学习速成识字法的有关文件，参观实际教学和参加试验教学工作，并举行各种教学座谈会、讨论会和检讨会，展开批评与自我批评。这样就改变了教员们对速成识字法各种错误的认识。教员们纷纷对旧的教学观点进行了批判。如上海国棉二厂业余学校教员林雪娟说：“过去我曾长期存在盲目崇拜专家的思想。祁建华速成识字法公布后我就瞧不起他。我想，他又不是专家，搞这一套岂不是胡闹吗？经过这次学习，我才体会到要真正做好速成识字法的教学工作，不是一个技术问题，而是必须有全心全意为人民服务的思想！”苏南区的教员们批判了不安心业余教育工作的错误思想，进一步体会到工农业余教育工作对国家经济建设的伟大意义，从而认识到自己职责的光荣和重大。
    在六月十九日的结业典礼大会上，全体学员一致表示：要继续努力，做好速成识字法的推广工作，为满足全国六十万纺织工人的文化要求而奋斗！
