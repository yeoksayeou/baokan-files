    (II) Curbing the Provocative Acts of the U.S. Aggressors in Expanding the War of Aggression
    While unreasonably delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. aggressors have also carried out a series of serious provocative actions against the Korean and Chinese people during the negotiations. After the U.S. Air Force in Korea bombed the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant and other peaceful facilities in late June, they conducted a large-scale and barbaric bombing of peaceful people's residential areas in Pyongyang, Korea, on July 11. On the same day, eight U.S. aircraft also invaded the airspace of Andong in Northeast China, carrying out indiscriminate strafing, killing and wounding 52 of our peaceful residents. For the next five consecutive days, U.S. aircraft continued to intrude into our Northeast airspace as many as 489 sorties. The acts of the U.S. aggressors in using peaceful facilities and peaceful cities as targets for狂轟濫炸 (frantic bombing) and constantly violating our country's airspace to directly provoke our country have aroused great anger and hatred among the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world.
    The crimes of the U.S. Air Force in Korea in狂轟濫炸 (frantically bombing) and directly invading our country's airspace show that the U.S. aggressors are continuing to play the already bankrupt adventurous gamble of so-called "military pressure." The U.S. aggressors vainly attempt to use the adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure" to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people and force the Chinese and Korean people to submit to their unreasonable demands. However, this cowardly and rogue attempt by the U.S. aggressors is doomed to complete failure. At the beginning of the negotiations last year, the U.S. aggressors launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive" in an attempt to force our side to accept their unreasonable demands at the negotiating table; however, under the strong blows of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, these so-called offensives boasted by the enemy all suffered shameful and tragic failures. Over the past year, the U.S. aggressors have lost more soldiers and equipment. The increasingly stronger Korean and Chinese People's forces have annihilated more than 325,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged more than 5,900 enemy aircraft in the past year alone. The germ warfare waged by the U.S. aggressors in Korea and our country has also been defeated by the Korean and Chinese people. Therefore, the狂轟濫炸 (frantic bombing) of peaceful people and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, as well as the adventurous actions of directly invading our country's airspace, will only further expose its cruelty and cowardice in front of the people of the world, and it is impossible to achieve any of its despicable goals. The U.S. government's continued adoption of this adventurous policy that has already gone bankrupt only proves that it has no intention of repentance, and is deliberately creating a more serious situation in Asia and the Far East in order to undermine the armistice negotiations, expand the war of aggression, and further threaten peace and security in Asia and the world.
    All the Chinese people feel great anger and hatred for the cowardly, shameless, and insane provocative crimes of the U.S. aggressors. People from all walks of life, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations across the country have recently issued statements or talks, unanimously and firmly supporting the solemn statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government on July 12 regarding the protest against the U.S. government's shameless provocations; and expressing deep sympathy and concern for the suffering Korean people. The Chinese people will never be intimidated by any provocations of the enemy, and will further strengthen the work of 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea), work hard to increase production and practice economy, make persistent efforts to support the Chinese and Korean People's forces, and continue to give the U.S. aggressors doubled blows to strive for and defend peace in Asia and the world.

    （二）制止美国侵略者扩大侵略战争的挑衅行为
    美国侵略者一面无理地拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面又在谈判期间，对朝中人民进行一连串的严重挑衅行动。侵朝美国空军于六月下旬轰炸鸭绿江水电厂等和平设施之后，又于七月十一日对朝鲜平壤和平人民集居地区进行了大规模的野蛮轰炸，美机八架同日并侵犯我国东北安东领空，滥行扫射，死伤我和平居民五十二人。以后接连五天，美机继续向我东北领空进犯达四百八十九架次之多。美国侵略者这种以和平设施与和平城市作为狂轰滥炸目标和不断侵犯我国领空向我国直接挑衅的行为，已激起中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒和仇恨。
    侵朝美国空军狂轰滥炸和直接侵犯我国领空的罪行，表明美国侵略者是在继续玩弄早已破产了的所谓“军事压力”的冒险赌博。美国侵略者妄想用所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策，恐吓朝鲜和中国人民，压迫中朝人民在他们的无理要求面前屈服。但是，美国侵略者这种卑怯的无赖企图是注定了要完全失败的。美国侵略者在去年的谈判初期，曾发动过所谓“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”，图迫使我方在谈判会上接受其无理的要求；然而，在朝中人民部队的坚强打击下，敌人所吹嘘的这些所谓攻势，都一一遭到了可耻的悲惨失败。一年来，美国侵略者丧失了更多的兵员和装备。愈战愈强的朝中人民部队仅在过去一年中，就歼灭了敌军三十二万五千多名，击落击伤敌机五千九百多架。美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国进行的细菌战，也同样被朝中人民打败了。因此，美国侵略者对朝鲜后方和平人民、和平设施的狂轰滥炸，以及直接侵犯我国领空的冒险行动，除了在全世界人民面前更加暴露其残忍和卑怯外，是决不可能达到它的任何卑鄙目的的。美国政府继续采取这种早已破产的冒险政策，只证明它毫无悔祸之心，而在蓄意造成亚洲及远东更加严重的局势，以便破坏停战谈判，扩大侵略战争，进一步威胁亚洲和世界的和平与安全。
    对于美国侵略者这种卑怯、无耻的疯狂挑衅的罪行，全中国人民感到极大的愤怒和仇恨。全国各阶层人民、各民主党派、各人民团体，最近纷纷发表了声明或谈话，一致坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长七月十二日关于抗议美国政府无耻挑衅的严正声明；并对受难的朝鲜人民表示深切的同情与关怀。中国人民是绝不会为敌人的任何挑衅所吓倒的，必将更加加强抗美援朝工作，努力增产节约，再接再厉地支援中朝人民部队，继续予美国侵略者以加倍的打击，以争取与保卫亚洲及世界的和平。
