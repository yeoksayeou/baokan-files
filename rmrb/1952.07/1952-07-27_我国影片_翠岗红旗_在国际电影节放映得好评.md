Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 26th: The screening of the Chinese film "Cuigang Red Flag" at the International Film Festival in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia on the 19th was a major event at this year's festival. Attendees at the screening included the Czechoslovak Minister of Propaganda and Culture, Mr. Kopecky, the Soviet Union and other national delegations participating in the film festival, as well as prominent figures from the Czechoslovak cultural and social circles. Before the screening, Li Jingwen, a member of the Chinese delegation, introduced the film. The audience paid close attention to the film throughout the screening. When the film finally showed the scenes of the attack on Cuigang and the reunion of the protagonist Jiang Mengzi with his family, the entire audience stood up and cheered loudly for Stalin, Gottwald, and Mao Zedong for a long time.

Foreign guests expressed their profound impressions after watching the film. Minister Kopecky said: From this film, we can understand why Chairman Mao Zedong is so loved by the Chinese people. Soviet film director and Stalin Prize winner, Mr. Churei, congratulated the Chinese delegation immediately after the film was shown. He said, "We thank you for bringing such a film to the festival." Mr. Sadoul, the editor-in-chief of "French Literature" in France, said: Following "The Steel Fighter" and "The White Haired Girl," this film once again proves the importance of young Chinese cinema. The inspiration that Chinese films give us French people is comparable in value to the Soviet films "Battleship Potemkin" or "Mother" from twenty-five years ago.

Prague's "Red Right Newspaper," "Free Talk," and other major newspapers have published reviews praising the film. "Red Right Newspaper" said: "This is a great new achievement in the Chinese film industry. Through ingenious artistic generalization, the audience sees the Chinese history of the past few decades and understands the invincible power of the Chinese people."

In addition to "Cuigang Red Flag," the Chinese films already screened at the film festival include "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" and the documentary "Happy Xinjiang." The documentary "Resist America, Aid Korea" will be screened on the evening of the 27th.

The Chinese delegation held a press conference on the 17th, where Cai Chusheng, the head of the delegation, introduced the situation of film production in China. In answering questions raised by reporters, he emphasized the help and cooperation of the Soviet film industry to the Chinese film industry.

    我国影片“翠岗红旗”
    在国际电影节放映得好评
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】在捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维·发利举行的国际电影节，于十九日放映我国影片“翠岗红旗”，这是本届电影节的一件大事。放映时出席的有捷克斯洛伐克宣传与文化部长柯别茨基、苏联及其他国家参加电影节的代表团，以及捷克斯洛伐克文化界与社会名流。在放映前，我国代表团团员李景文对影片作了介绍。放映期间观众非常注意欣赏。当影片最后放映到攻击翠岗和主角江猛子与家人团聚的场面时，全体观众起立，长久地欢呼斯大林、哥特瓦尔德和毛泽东。
    外宾们在看完这部影片之后纷纷表示他们所获得的深刻印象。柯别茨基部长说：从这部影片中我们可以明白为什么毛泽东主席那样受到中国人民的爱戴。苏联电影导演、斯大林奖金得奖人乔勒利在影片映完之后，马上向中国代表团致贺。他说：“我们谢谢你们给电影节带来了这样一部片子。”法国的
    “法兰西文学”总编辑萨杜说：继“钢铁战士”和
    “白毛女”之后，这部片子再度证明了年青的中国电影的重要性。中国电影给我们法国人的启示，其价值可以和二十五年前的苏联影片“波将军铁甲舰”或“母亲”相比。
    布拉格的“红色权利报”、“自由谈”及其他大报都发表评论赞扬这部电影。“红色权利报”说：“这是中国电影事业的巨大新成就，观众通过神妙的艺术概括手法，看到了过去几十年来的中国历史，并了解到中国人民不可征服的力量。”
    已在电影节放映的我国影片除“翠岗红旗”外，还有“内蒙人民的胜利”和纪录片“欢乐的新疆”。纪录片“抗美援朝”将在二十七日晚间放映。
    我国代表团曾在十七日举行记者招待会，由代表团团长蔡楚生介绍我国的制片工作情形。他在回答记者所提出的问题时，着重指出了苏联电影界对于我国电影界的帮助与合作。
