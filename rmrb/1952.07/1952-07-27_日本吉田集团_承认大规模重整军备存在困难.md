Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Japan's Yoshida government's policy of rearmament, carried out in accordance with the wishes of the United States, faces serious difficulties due to the opposition of the Japanese people and Japan's poor financial situation.

    The opposition faction within Japan's ruling Liberal Party, led by former party president Ichiro Hatoyama, in order to win favor with the United States, advocates openly and comprehensively carrying out rearmament. The Hatoyama group publicly opposes the covert, gradual rearmament policy implemented by the Yoshida group, the ruling faction of the party, which is to gradually establish a regular army under the guise of the "Police Reserve Force." Instead, they demand that the Liberal Party openly advocate comprehensive rearmament in the next general election.

    Although the Yoshida group is as active as the Hatoyama group on the issue of rearmament, they face insurmountable difficulties. Ikeda Hayato, a key figure in the Yoshida group and Minister of Finance, publicly opposed the Hatoyama group's proposal for open and comprehensive rearmament at a press conference on the 15th of this month. According to Kyodo News, Ikeda will present various arguments to refute the Hatoyama group's claims during the election campaign for the next general election. The arguments listed by Kyodo News expose the realities faced by the ruling Yoshida group on the issue of rearmament. Kyodo News said that Ikeda also believes that "Japan may inevitably have to amend its constitution and rearm in the near future." However, the Yoshida group knows that if it implements this policy nakedly, it will be met with stronger opposition from the Japanese people. "If the Liberal Party expresses its opinions frankly on these sensitive issues, it will not be able to gain the support of the vast majority in the next general election." Therefore, Ikeda believes that "since the general public has not yet deeply understood the need for rearmament, there is no need to rush to talk about this issue in the next general election." In other words, the plan for rearmament can only continue to be carried out secretly.

    Kyodo News said that another important argument of Ikeda Hayato is to explain the difficulty of large-scale rearmament based on Japan's poor financial situation. According to calculations, if Japan were to restore the strength of the Japanese army, navy, and air force at the time of the outbreak of the Pacific War, "the total cost would require 4.4 trillion yen, and an annual recurring cost of 1.1 trillion yen." But as everyone knows, this year's entire Japanese budget is only over 850 billion yen. "Even establishing the most basic military equipment would require 600 billion to 800 billion yen." This is also something that Japan cannot afford financially for the time being.

    Under the above circumstances, Kyodo News explained that Ikeda will have to come to this conclusion: "At present, Japan has no other choice but to gradually establish a police reserve force and a maritime safety agency. From a financial point of view, it is sheer fantasy to immediately carry out large-scale rearmament."

### 日本吉田集团  承认大规模重整军备存在困难

    日本吉田集团
    承认大规模重整军备存在困难
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府按照美国的意志所进行的重新武装的政策，由于日本人民的反对及日本的恶劣的财政情况，面临着严重的困难。
    日本执政党自由党内部的反对派，以该党前总裁鸠山一郎为首的鸠山集团，为了要取得美国的欢心，主张公开地全面地进行重新武装。鸠山集团对于该党当权派吉田集团所执行的隐蔽的、逐步的重新武装的政策，即在“警察后备队”的外衣下逐渐建立正规陆军的政策，公开表示反对，而要求自由党在下届大选中公开主张全面的重整军备。
    尽管吉田集团在重新武装的问题上和鸠山集团同样积极，但他们却面临着不可克服的困难。吉田集团的主要人物、藏相（财政大臣）池田勇人在本月十五日的记者招待会上公开反对鸠山集团所提出的公开地全面地重新武装的主张。据共同社透露：在下届大选的竞选运动中，池田将提出各种论据来反驳鸠山集团的主张。共同社所列举的池田的论据，暴露了执政的吉田集团在重新武装问题上所面对的现实。共同社说：池田也认为“日本可能在不久的将来不可避免地要修改其宪法并重新武装”。但是吉田集团知道：如果它赤裸裸地执行这种政策，必将遭到日本人民更强烈的反对。“如果自由党对于这些尖锐的问题直率地表示意见，那么它在下届大选中就不可能再得到绝大多数的支持。”因此，池田认为“既然一般人民还没有深切明了重整军备的需要，在下届大选中就不应急于要谈这个问题”。换言之，就是对重新武装的计划只能继续采取偷偷地进行的方法。
    共同社说：池田勇人的另一重要论据，是根据日本的恶劣的财政情况，说明大规模重新武装的困难。据计算，日本如果要恢复太平洋战争爆发时的日本陆、海、空军实力，“全部费用将需要四万四千亿日元，并需要每年一万一千亿日元的经常费。”但是大家知道，今年度日本的全部预算也不过八千五百多亿日元。“即使建立最起码的军备，也需要六千亿到八千亿日元的经费。”这也是日本在财政上一时无法负担的。
    在上述情况下，共同社说明，池田将不得不作出这样的结论：“目前日本除了逐步建立警察后备队和海上保安厅之外，没有其他办法。就财政观点上看来，要立即大规模地重整军备无异痴人说梦。”
