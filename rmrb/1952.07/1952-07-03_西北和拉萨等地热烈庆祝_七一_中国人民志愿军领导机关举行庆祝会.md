The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, initiated by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, has made great contributions to the people of Korea, the Far East, and the world. He said: We, the Korean People's Army, will continue to fight together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist U.S. imperialist aggression and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue under fair and reasonable conditions.
