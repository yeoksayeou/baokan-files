The Party Committee of the Organs Directly Under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Second Party Congress from June 23rd to 27th to summarize the work of the thirteen months since the First Party Congress and to mobilize the study of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The congress unanimously approved the work summary report of the Party Committee, emphatically discussed and adopted the plan for studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and re-elected the Party Committee.

The congress considered it extremely necessary to conduct the study of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" among all cadres and party members of the organs directly under the Central Committee. Because in the past thirteen months, the movements of personnel review, party consolidation, economy and anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy have greatly improved the work of the central organs and brought about many new atmospheres; it is now urgent to consolidate the achievements already made and continue to develop these achievements. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the construction work in ideology, organization and system. The core of ideological construction is to strengthen theoretical education and study the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Among the 383 proposals received by the congress, 130 were on the study problem, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of proposals. This fully demonstrates the comrades' attention and urgent demand for this issue.

Based on the results of the delegates' discussions, the congress decided to start the study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from late July, dividing it into two levels, A and B, for one year. A plan was formulated, stipulating that the purpose of the study is to "enable cadres to become familiar with the main works of Comrade Mao Zedong through this study, so as to deepen their understanding of the basic issues of the Chinese revolution and their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, and to lay the foundation for future theoretical study in the central organs." The specific requirements for Level A study are to read each article carefully once, focusing on reading several articles, and selecting one article from each volume as a test; Level B will use Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" as a clue to study Comrade Mao Zedong's important works in various periods of the Chinese revolution and several articles related to the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoints and methods, with a test for each section. In addition, a group of comrades lacking basic revolutionary theoretical knowledge was compiled into Level C to study the Reader of Political Common Sense.

The congress decided to solve the problem of study tutors by relying on its own efforts. The Party Committee designated ten comrades to organize a "'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' Study Tutoring Group," which, in addition to giving one or two enlightenment reports or introductions before each section of study, and giving a general answer at the end of each section, will also guide the work of the tutors of various organs. The study tutors of each organ shall be cultivated by each organ from the cadres in service, and the heads of each organ are required to allow the tutors to adjust some of the time of their professional work so that they can learn more in order to complete the following two tasks: A, to convey the Party Committee's opinions on carrying out the study and to guide the study of their own units; B, to help the comrades participating in the study to answer questions, and if there are any difficulties, they can be submitted to the Party Committee Office for handling.

After the closing of the congress, the second Party Committee is revising the plan and formally forming classes. The high tide of cadres and party members of the central organs studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is coming soon.

    中共中央直属机关第二次党代表大会
    动员学习“毛泽东选集”
    中国共产党中央直属机关委员会为了总结第一次党代表大会以来十三个月的工作，并动员学习“毛泽东选集”，于六月二十三日至二十七日召开了第二次党代表大会。大会一致同意党委的工作总结报告，着重地讨论和通过了学习“毛泽东选集”的计划，并改选了党委员会。
    大会认为，在中央直属机关的全体干部党员中，进行“毛泽东选集”的学习极为必要。因为在过去十三个月内进行了审查人员、整党、节约与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，使中直各机关的工作有很大的进步，出现了许多新的气象；现在亟须巩固已得的成绩并继续发展这些成绩。因此，必须加强思想上、组织上和制度上的建设工作。而思想建设工作的中心，就是要加强理论教育工作、学习“毛泽东选集”。大会收到的三百八十三件提案中，关于学习问题的提案，达一百三十件，占提案总数三分之一以上。这充分表现了同志们对于这个问题的重视和要求的迫切。
    根据代表们讨论的结果，大会决定对“毛泽东选集”的学习，从七月下旬开始，分甲乙两级学习一年。并制定了计划，规定学习的目的在于“通过此项学习，使干部对于毛泽东同志的主要著作能够熟悉，以便加深对中国革命基本问题的了解和对毛泽东思想的领会，并为中直各机关今后的理论学习奠定基础。”对甲级学习的具体要求，是每篇认真读一遍，并着重阅读若干篇，每卷读完之后各选文章一篇，作为测验；乙级则以胡乔木同志著“中国共产党的三十年”为线索，学习毛泽东同志在中国革命各个时期的重要著作及其有关马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法的文章若干篇，每个段落进行测验一次。此外，还把一批缺乏基本革命理论知识的同志编为丙级，学习政治常识读本。
    大会决定以自力更生的办法解决学习辅导员问题。由党委指定同志十人组织“‘毛泽东选集’学习辅导组”，除在每一段落学习之前，作一二次启发报告或情况介绍，并在每一段落结束时作一次总的解答以外，还指导各机关辅导员的工作。各机关学习辅导员由各机关从在职干部中自己培养，并要求各机关首长允许调整辅导员一部分业务工作的时间，使他们能多学一点，以便完成下列两个任务：甲、传达党委辅导组关于进行学习的意见并指导本单位的学习；乙、帮助参加学习的同志们解答问题，如有疑难，可汇交党委办公室处理。
    大会闭幕后，第二届党委正在订正计划、正式编班。中直各机关干部党员学习“毛泽东选集”的高潮很快就要到来了。
