The anti-bureaucracy movement is currently being carried out in depth throughout Chahar Province through the Zhang Shunyou incident. The central content is opposing the neglect of mass opinion. The publication of the Zhang Shunyou incident has attracted the attention of the leading organs of Chahar Province. In addition to issuing calls for checking bureaucracy, the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government have successively held several report meetings and joint meetings of responsible cadres of various units, repeatedly urging a serious examination of bureaucracy. At a report meeting of responsible persons of party groups of directly subordinate organs convened by the Provincial Party Committee on June 14, Yang Shijie, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, called on all departments to conduct in-depth inspections of bureaucratic work styles, so as to further improve the leadership style, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between the government and the masses in future work. At the same time, it was required that each department formulate specific plans to consolidate the achievements of anti-bureaucracy from the system. All counties in the province have also launched an anti-bureaucracy inspection movement. As of now, Yanggao, Yangyuan, Wanquan, Zuoyun, Huailai, Huaian, Hunyuan, Datong, Xuanhua, Yuxian, Guyuan, Chongli, Shangyi, Pinglu, Shanyin and other counties, as well as the three cities of Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua, and the organs of the three special districts of Yanbei, Chanan, and Chabei, have all started this inspection work, and responsible cadres have made mobilization reports or organized cadres to study. The development of this movement has been warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses of people. Since the beginning of the movement, the reader's letter group of the Chahar Daily alone has received 150 letters from readers reporting bureaucracy. In order to further launch the struggle against bureaucracy throughout the province, the Provincial People's Supervisory Committee convened a meeting of cadres from provincial-level organs and Zhangjiakou city organs on June 20. Director Yang Shijie made a mobilization report based on the spirit of the meeting of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on handling the Zhang Shunyou case, and criticized several erroneous attitudes.

During the process of inspecting bureaucracy, Chahar Province and other places discovered many serious phenomena. Among the provincial-level leading organs, the main manifestations of bureaucracy are insufficient attention to handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. The Provincial People's Government has not set up a people's inquiry office and reception room in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council. The General Office, which is responsible for this work, only designated a new cadre to handle this work incidentally. The registration and follow-up system is also unsound, and some departments even have the phenomenon of losing people's letters. Most of the letters received by the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the General Office of the Provincial People's Government are forwarded to the relevant departments or various departments for processing, but very few processing opinions are put forward. The letters transferred to the various departments are usually transferred to the "relevant departments" again. For example, the Department of Civil Affairs pushed most of the letters and visits from family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to the special offices and counties for resolution. There are still fifty-five cases whose results are unknown. This forms a phenomenon of layer-by-layer transfer and layer-by-layer pushing, so that problems cannot be effectively solved. The attitude of some staff members of some departments towards the people who come to visit is also very bad. Zhang Ying, a revolutionary disabled soldier from Xuanhua County, went to the Department of Civil Affairs to request a job introduction. He planned to have a meal in the Department of Civil Affairs. The administrator was very unhappy and reprimanded: "Breakfast is over, lunch has not arrived, what do you want to eat!" In this way, Zhang Ying was "sent away." Some disaster victims came to the provincial-level organs to solve problems. It happened to be Sunday, and the staff used the excuse that "the office is not open on Sunday" and dismissed it with one push. What's worse, Xu Wenru, the former director of the Preferential Treatment Bureau, openly said to his subordinates: "Anyone who comes to us without an introduction letter will not be taken care of." This irresponsible practice has prevented many revolutionary disabled soldiers' problems from being properly resolved. A demobilized soldier in Datong City came to the Preferential Treatment Bureau to request a job introduction. Because he did not bring an introduction letter, he could not even enter the gate. The Provincial People's Court did not implement the policy of facilitating the people. They still use the old litigation procedures, and the plaintiff must file a written complaint before it can be accepted. They are very impatient with oral complaints, and even simply refuse them. A woman from Tianzhen County went to the Provincial People's Court to file a lawsuit. Because she did not have a complaint, she had to return to her hometown.

At present, the provincial-level organs have shifted the focus of anti-bureaucracy to checking the neglect of the interests of the masses in daily work. Many problems have also been initially discovered in this regard. The Provincial Department of Transportation is very serious in neglecting the interests of the masses. When building roads, they often fail to pay the wages of the masses in time after construction, and even have the behavior of deceiving the masses and deducting wages. In addition, due to the bureaucratic work style of some cadres in the bureau, the phenomenon of poor planning and waste of human and material resources in the work also continues to occur. The Department of Agriculture also inspected the mistakes in afforestation that caused losses to the interests of the people due to bureaucracy.

In the anti-bureaucracy inspection movement in various counties of Chahar Province, it was found that some counties adopted a perfunctory attitude in dealing with people's opinions and letters. For example, the Yuxian County People's Government delayed the handling of more than a dozen proposals from the People's Congress for a long time; it also did not respond to the nine materials transferred by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Yuxian County Committee criticizing the work style of cadres and the nine letters from readers transferred by the reader's letter group of the Chahar Daily. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Shangyi County, suggestion boxes were set up to facilitate mass reporting, and many reporting materials were received. However, they did not deal with these materials or explain them to the masses. They tied the reporting letters together and left them aside. The masses are very dissatisfied with this irresponsible practice. In terms of receiving mass visits, the counties do not pay much attention. In April of this year, a farmer went to the Chabei Public Security Office four times to expose the bad work style of village cadres, but was pushed to the Zhangbei County Public Security Bureau. The Zhangbei County Public Security Bureau adopted a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring it. The masses also reflected this situation to the Public Security Office of the Special Office, but the office still did not find a way to deal with it. It was not until the Zhang Shunyou incident was published in the newspaper that the office cooperated with the Zhangbei County Public Security Bureau to conduct an investigation at the residence of the accuser. The People's Courts and Public Security Bureaus of various counties also inspected the bureaucratic work style and illegal acts of cadres in handling cases. For example, Lu Chaozhong, a clerk of the Wanquan County Court, took the opportunity to run home privately when he went to the countryside to investigate a case, and transferred the masses from other villages related to the case to his own home for processing.

Through preliminary inspections throughout the province, many serious facts of bureaucracy have been discovered, and cadres at all levels have begun to realize the seriousness of bureaucracy harming the revolutionary cause. However, the development of this movement is not widespread enough, the inspection of bureaucracy is not deep enough, and the following problems still exist: (1) The leading cadres of some organs and units lack the spirit of taking the lead in inspections. They mistakenly focus the inspection on lower-level cadres. Some counties even propose to focus on districts and streets, which completely violates the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions. (2) Industrial and mining enterprises and individual counties refuse to carry out this work under the pretext of "busy work" and "no time," and even adopt a resistant attitude towards this work. (3) Some cadres still have ideological concerns, fearing that they will be punished for checking out mistakes, and that their superiors will no longer trust them, so they dodge and try to get by. At the meeting of cadres from provincial-level organs and Zhangjiakou city organs held on June 20, Comrade Yang Shijie made a serious criticism of these erroneous thoughts and incorrect attitudes. Now, the above situation is being reversed.

    察哈尔省各地反对官僚主义的运动
    锺英
    目前，察哈尔全省各地正通过张顺有事件，深入开展反对官僚主义运动，其中心内容是反对漠视群众意见。张顺有事件的公布，引起了察哈尔省领导机关的重视。省级各领导机关除已分别发出检查官僚主义的号召外，中共察哈尔省委、省人民政府并接连召开了多次汇报会议和各单位负责干部联席会议，一再督促认真检查官僚主义。六月十四日省委召集的各直属机关党组负责人汇报会上，省委副书记杨士杰号召各部门深入检查官僚主义作风，以便在今后工作中把领导作风、党和群众的关系、政府和群众的关系进一步求得改善。同时要求各部门订出具体计划，以便从制度上来巩固反官僚主义的成果。全省各县也展开了反官僚主义的检查运动。截至目前为止，阳高、阳原、万全、左云、怀来、怀安、浑源、大同、宣化、蔚县、沽源、崇礼、尚义、平鲁、山阴等县及张家口、大同、宣化三市和雁北、察南、察北三个专区机关，均已开始了此项检查工作，并都由负责干部作了动员报告或组织干部进行了学习。这一运动的开展受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎和支持。从运动开始以来，仅察哈尔日报社读者来信组就收到读者检举官僚主义的信件一百五十件。为了进一步在全省范围内继续展开反对官僚主义的斗争，省人民监察委员会在六月二十日又召集了省级机关、张家口市机关干部大会，由杨士杰主任根据中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会处理张顺有案件会议的精神作了动员报告，并对几种错误态度进行了批判。
    察哈尔省各地在检查官僚主义的过程中，发现了许多严重现象。在省级各领导机关中，官僚主义的表现主要是对处理人民来信和接见人民来访工作不够重视。省人民政府没有按照政务院的规定设立人民问事处和接待室，主办这一工作的办公厅只指定了一个新干部捎带办理这一工作。登记和催办制度也不健全，有的部门更有丢失人民来信的现象。省协商委员会、省人民政府办公厅接到的群众来信多半是原文照转有关部门或各厅处理，而又很少提出处理意见。转到各厅的信件，各厅又照例再转“有关部门”。如民政厅对烈属、军属、革命残废军人、转业军人的来信、来访，大部都推到专署、县去解决，到现在还有五十五件不知处理结果。这样就形成层层转、层层推的现象，以致不能切实解决问题。有些部门的某些工作人员，对来访的人民群众的态度也很恶劣。宣化县革命残废军人张英到民政厅请求介绍工作时，打算在民政厅吃顿饭，管理员很不高兴，训斥说：“早饭已过，午饭没到，你想吃什么！”这样就把张英“打发”出去了。有的灾民来省级机关解决问题，正逢星期日，工作人员就以“星期日不办公”为藉口，一推了事。更坏的是前优抚局局长许温如竟公然对他的下级干部说：“凡是没有带介绍信来我们这里的人，一概不管。”这种不负责任的作法，曾使许多革命残废军人的问题没有得到适当解决。大同市一个复员军人来优抚局请求介绍工作，因为没带介绍信，就连大门也进不去。省人民法院则没有贯彻便利人民的方针。他们仍沿用旧的诉讼手续，原告必须文字起诉才行受理。他们对口头起诉很不耐烦，甚至干脆拒绝。天镇县一妇女专门跑到省人民法院起诉，因为没有起诉书，只好又返回原籍。
    目前，省级机关已把反官僚主义的重点转向检查在日常工作中漠视群众利益方面。在这方面也已初步发现了不少问题。省交通局漠视群众利益的情况十分严重，他们在修建公路时，经常在施工后仍不及时付给群众工资，甚至有欺骗群众、克扣工资的行为。此外，该局因某些干部存在着官僚主义作风，在工作中计划不周，浪费人力、物力的现象也不断发生。农业厅也检查了在造林方面因官僚主义而使人民利益遭受损失的错误。
    察哈尔省各县在检查官僚主义运动中，发现某些县在处理人民意见、人民来信方面，采取了敷衍塞责的态度。如蔚县人民政府对人民代表会议的十多件提案，拖延很长时间没有处理；对中共蔚县委员会纪律检查委员会转去批评干部作风的材料九件和察哈尔日报读者来信组转去读者来信九件，也都没有答复。尚义县在镇压反革命期间，为了群众检举方便，曾设立了意见箱，并收到不少检举材料。但他们对这些材料，没有处理，没有向群众交代，把检举信捆在一起，放在一边不管了。群众对这种不负责任的作法十分不满。在接见群众来访方面，各县极不重视。在今年四月间曾有一个农民四次到察北公安办事处揭发村干部的坏作风，都被推到张北县公安局去。张北县公安局则采取了置之不理的官僚主义态度。群众把这种情况又反映到专署公安办事处，该处仍不设法处理。直到报纸上公布了张顺有事件以后，该处才协同张北县公安局到控告人住地进行调查。各县人民法院和公安局也检查了在处理案件中的官僚主义作风和干部的犯法行为。如万全县法院书记员卢朝忠在下乡调查一个案子时，趁机私自跑回家去，把和此案有关的其他村的群众调到他自己家里处理。
    全省各地经过初步检查，已发现了许多严重的官僚主义事实，各级干部也已开始认识到官僚主义为害革命事业的严重性。但这一运动开展得还不够广泛，对官僚主义的检查还不够深刻，而且还存在着下列几个问题：（一）某些机关单位的领导干部，缺乏带头检查的精神，他们错误地把检查重点放在下级干部身上，有的县甚至提出把重点放在区、街，这完全违背了省委指示的精神。（二）工矿企业部门和个别县份藉口“工作忙”、“没时间”而不进行这一工作，甚至对这一工作抱抵抗态度。（三）有些干部思想上还有顾虑，怕检查出错误来受处分，上级不再信任，于是躲躲闪闪，企图混过去。对于这些错误思想和不正确态度，在六月二十日召开的省级机关、张家口市机关干部大会上，杨士杰同志已作了严肃的批判。现在，上述情况正在扭转。
