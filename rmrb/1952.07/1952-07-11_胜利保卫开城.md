    Victoriously Defending Kaesong
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Shu and Ri Hong

    In the year since the Korean armistice talks began, our troops on the Western Front have valiantly defended Kaesong, a city of concern to peace-loving people worldwide. The American aggressors have launched hundreds of attacks and raids on the outskirts of this city, vainly attempting to use so-called "military pressure" to coordinate with the American representatives' conspiratorial activities at the negotiating table. The defenders of Kaesong have resolutely crushed the enemy's arrogant military offensives, preventing them from advancing an inch and inflicting heavy losses. Over the past year, the troops guarding Kaesong have annihilated more than 12,800 enemy soldiers and destroyed or damaged many enemy aircraft, tanks, artillery pieces, speedboats, and wooden boats.

    The failure of the American aggressors on the Kaesong front, like their defeats in other theaters, proves that their vaunted "military pressure" has completely gone bankrupt. Last year, when the armistice talks were discussing the issue of determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the American aggressors, while unreasonably insisting at the negotiating table on their absurd demand to seize our Kaesong area, simultaneously concentrated a considerable force to frantically invade the Kaesong area. This despicable conspiracy and arrogant attempt aroused the anger of the warriors defending Kaesong, who wrote letters of determination to the Korean-Chinese armistice negotiation delegation and their superiors, saying, "Resolutely smash the enemy's offensive, defend Kaesong, and support the Korean-Chinese armistice negotiation delegation in striving for the realization of peace in Korea." They bravely met the invading enemy and achieved victory in killing and wounding a large number of enemy soldiers at a small cost.

    The victorious battle to defend Height 88.6 northeast of Panmunjom is a glorious example of the defense of Kaesong. This height is an outpost of Daedeok Mountain, the southeastern shield of Kaesong. The American aggressors repeatedly attempted to seize this position in order to control Daedeok Mountain and open the way to invade Kaesong, but each of their offensives ended in惨敗. Last December, when the American representatives were shouting in the conference tent that "let artillery and bullets continue the debate," the American aggressors once again frantically attacked this position. After bombarding it for several hours with many aircraft and artillery batteries, they used a battalion of troops to attack this small position in three directions. Defending this position was only a platoon from the Eighth Company of a certain unit of our army. The soldiers calmly allowed the enemy to approach within 20 or 30 meters of the position, and then used sudden firepower to kill and wound them, repelling many enemy charges in succession. However, the enemy still rushed forward despite heavy casualties, and mobilized more than a battalion of troops to outflank the flanks and rear, occupying the main peak of the position and attacking our position together with the enemy below the mountain. At this critical moment, our wounded warriors picked up their guns again to participate in the battle, and the seriously wounded warriors crawled on the ground to help load bullets and open grenade covers. Political Instructor Su Wenlu raised his submachine gun and shouted, "Resolutely defend Kaesong and annihilate the aggressors!" His submachine gun blocked a traffic trench, killing the enemies who rushed up one after another. Soldier Xu San picked up grenades thrown by the enemy and threw them back. The warriors fought bravely for three hours, and finally, together with the reinforcements, repelled the enemy's offensive and achieved a victory in annihilating more than 500 enemies.

    In order to invade this position, the American aggressors lost a total of more than 2,700 officers and soldiers in several offensives, but the result was still nothing. One of our soldiers ridiculed the enemy, saying, "What a 'debate battle' by the American aggressors. You have no right to speak in front of the Chinese and Korean People's Army! What you can't get at the conference table, you can't get on the battlefield."

    In March of this year, when the American aggressors insisted on the absurd plan of detaining a large number of our captured personnel at the conference table, they transferred their elite troops, the 1st Marine Division, to the area near Panmunjom. According to American news agencies, at that time, the "United Nations Command" relaxed news confidentiality restrictions for the first time and announced the news that this force had taken over the defense, vainly attempting to threaten the Korean-Chinese side into accepting its absurd plan. However, what this so-called elite force received was still a miserable failure. On May 9 of this year, the division used five companies of troops, under the cover of many aircraft and tanks, to invade Height 159 on the east side of Panmunjom. The two reinforced squads of a certain unit of our army defending this position bravely repelled eight enemy charges. When the enemy launched the last attack, the soldiers jumped out of their fortifications and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. When their bayonets were bent, they used gun butts, shovels, and stones to fight the enemy. Squad Leader Zeng Yisheng, after being seriously wounded, tightly hugged an enemy and rolled down a very high cliff, gloriously perishing together with the enemy. Deputy Platoon Leader Wu Zhilin was wounded in many places, but still fought bravely with the enemy, stabbing several enemies to death. The warriors repelled the enemy's offensive in hand-to-hand combat, annihilating more than 250 enemies. To this day, the warriors are still guarding Height 159; the enemy has not been able to advance an inch. Van Fleet recently said something like "The only thing the Communist army understands is strength." The Kaesong defenders couldn't help but laugh when they heard the enemy making such boastful remarks, saying, "We do understand the 'strength' of the American aggressors, which is nothing more than a paper tiger with great ambition but insufficient strength."

    On the Kaesong front in the past year, there are many examples of victorious battles like the ones mentioned above. The heroic defenders are becoming stronger and stronger as they fight. With extraordinary perseverance and tremendous labor, they have built the continuous mountains into a steel defense line. The artillery donated by the people of the motherland has arrived on the Kaesong front, and every day it accurately and fiercely kills and wounds the invading enemy. The commanders and fighters who have been tempered in battle are all high-spirited and full of confidence. They will fight to the end to defend the safety of the armistice negotiation meeting site and the Kaesong neutral zone, and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis!

    胜利保卫开城
    新华社记者  王殊、日红
    朝鲜停战谈判举行以来的一年中，我军在西线的部队英勇地保卫着全世界和平人民心目所系的城市——开城。美国侵略者已经在这座城市的外围进行了数百次的进攻和袭击，妄想用所谓“军事压力”来配合美方代表在谈判桌上的阴谋活动。开城的保卫者们坚强地粉碎了敌人狂妄的军事进攻，使敌人始终不能前进一步，并使他们遭受了惨重损失。一年以来，守卫开城的部队共计歼灭敌军一万二千八百多名，并击毁击伤了敌人的许多飞机、战车、大炮、汽艇和木船。
    美国侵略者在开城前线的失败，像在其他战区的败绩一样，证明他们所叫嚣的“军事压力”已经彻底破产。去年停战谈判进行关于确定军事分界线和非军事地区问题的讨论时，美国侵略者曾经一面在谈判桌上无理地坚持强占我开城地区的荒谬要求，
    一面集中相当大的兵力疯狂进犯开城地区。这种卑劣的阴谋和狂妄的企图激起了守卫开城的勇士们的愤怒，他们纷纷向朝中停战谈判代表团和上级写决心书说：“坚决粉碎敌人的进攻，保卫开城，支持朝中停战谈判代表团争取实现朝鲜的和平。”他们奋勇地迎击进犯的敌人，以很小的代价取得了杀伤大量敌人的胜利。
    保卫板门店东北八八·六高地的胜利战斗，是开城保卫战的一个光辉战例。这个高地是开城东南屏障大德山的前哨阵地。美国侵略军多次企图夺取这个阵地，从而控制大德山，打开侵占开城的道路，但是他们的每次进攻都遭到了惨败。去年十二月，美方代表在会议帐篷内叫嚣“让大炮、子弹继续辩论”的时候，美国侵略者又一次疯狂地进犯这个阵地。他们用许多飞机和炮群轰击数小时后，用一个营兵力分三路围攻这个小小的阵地。守卫这阵地的只有我某部第八连的一个排。战士们沉着地让敌人冲近阵地二、三十公尺时，用突然的火力杀伤他们，接连打退敌人许多次冲锋。但是敌人仍不顾惨重伤亡地扑上来，并调动一个多营兵力迂回到侧后，占领了阵地的主峰，与山下敌人一起夹击我军阵地。在这危急万分的时候，负轻伤的我军勇士们都重新拿起枪来参加作战，负重伤的勇士们爬在地上帮助压子弹和揭手榴弹盖。政治指导员苏文绿擎起冲锋枪高喊：“坚决保卫开城，消灭侵略者！”他的冲锋枪封锁了一条交通沟，把冲上来的敌人一个接一个地打死在那里。战士徐三拾起敌人投掷过来的手榴弹回击敌人。勇士们奋战了三个小时，最后与增援部队一起打退了敌人的进攻，取得了歼灭敌人五百多名的胜利。
    美国侵略者为了侵占这个阵地，在好几次进攻中一共损失了二千七百余名官兵，但结果仍一无所获。我军的一位战士嘲笑敌人说：“好一场美国侵略者的‘争辩战’。在中朝人民军队面前没有你们的发言权！你们在会议桌上得不到的，在战场上也不能得到。”
    今年三月间，美国侵略者在会议桌上坚持扣留大批我方被俘人员的荒谬方案时，又把他们的精锐部队海军陆战第一师调到板门店附近地区。据美国通讯社报道，当时“联合国军”司令部第一次放松了新闻保密限制，公布了这个部队接替防务的消息，妄图以此威胁朝中方面接受其荒谬方案。但是，这个所谓精锐部队得到的仍然是悲惨的失败。今年五月九日，该师用五个连兵力，在许多飞机和战车掩护下，进犯板门店东侧一五九高地。守卫这阵地的我军某部的两个加强班，英勇地打退了敌人八次冲锋。当敌人发动最后一次攻击时，战士们就跃出工事，与敌人展开白刃战，刺刀刺弯了，就用枪柄、铁锹和石块与敌人拚杀。班长曾义生负了重伤后，紧紧地抱住一个敌人滚下很高的悬崖，壮烈地与敌人同归于尽。副排长吴志林四处负伤，仍与敌人奋勇拚杀，刺死了几个敌人。勇士们在白刃战中打退了敌人的进攻，歼敌二百五十多名。至今，勇士们仍守卫在一五九高地上；敌人始终不能前进一步。范佛里特最近还说什么“共军所懂的一样东西，就是力量。”开城保卫者听到敌人这样大言不惭，不禁哑然失笑说：“我们的确懂得美国侵略者的‘力量’，就是它不过是一只纸老虎，野心很大，力量不足。”
    开城前线在过去一年中，像以上所说的胜利的战斗例子是很多的。英勇的守卫者们愈战愈强，他们以超人的毅力和巨大的劳动，已把绵亘的山岭构筑成为一道钢铁的防线。祖国人民捐献的大炮已到达了开城前线，每天在准确而猛烈地杀伤进犯的敌人。在战斗中得到锻炼的指挥员、战斗员们，个个战志昂扬，信心百倍，他们要为保卫停战谈判会议地址和开城中立区的安全，争取在公平合理基础上和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底！
