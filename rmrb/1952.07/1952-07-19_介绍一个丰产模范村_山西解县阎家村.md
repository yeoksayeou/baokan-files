Introducing a Model Village of Abundant Harvests - Yanjia Village, Jie County, Shanxi
Du Renzhi, Secretary-General of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government

During our spring plowing inspection, we examined Yanjia Village, a model village of abundant harvests, based on the standards of a new type of rural village in a New Democratic society. In addition to the personnel from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government inspection team, cadres from the Jie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jie County People's Government (who regularly guide the work in this village) also participated in the inspection.

I. Tragic History and Basic Conditions

Yanjia Village is a representative village in the cotton-producing area of Shanxi Province and has received the honorary title of "Model Village of Abundant Harvests" from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. The climate here is mild, and the land is fertile, with excellent conditions for developing agriculture (especially cotton cultivation). During the period of the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan's bandit rule, these superior natural conditions became the root cause of the farmers' poverty. Fertile land was often seized by local despots and landlords, concentrated in the hands of a few. More than 30 percent of the land was controlled by landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for less than 5 percent of the village's population, while the remaining 95 percent of the population had only 60 percent of the land. Before liberation, the destruction and devastation suffered by Yanjia Village under the reactionary rule of the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan's bandits were very serious: the village lost more than 60 laborers and was left with only eight head of livestock, five waterwheels, ten plows, and forty hoes, with more than two hundred mu of fertile land becoming wasteland. As a result, most of the middle peasants in the village faced difficulties of food shortages every year, and the 82 poor peasants and farm laborers found that the results of a year's hard work were not enough to sustain them for half a year.

Jie County was liberated in March 1947, and land reform was carried out in Jie County in 1949. Since then, the peasants have been emancipated and become masters of their own destiny, and everything has changed. At the time of the land reform, there were a total of 120 households (540 people) in the village, including three households of landlords and rich peasants (not counting the landlords in the city), 35 households of middle peasants, and 82 households of poor peasants and farm laborers. Now there are 126 households in the village, including 11 households that have declined and are poor peasants, and 115 households of middle peasants (about one-tenth of whom have risen to become prosperous middle peasants), with a total of 559 people (308 men and 251 women), 305 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, 52 head of livestock, 35 waterwheels, seven carts, and 1250.2 mu of land (at the time of land reform, there was an average of 1.57 mu per person, and now, after land reclamation and land measurement, the amount of land has increased to an average of 2.2 mu per person).

Most of the land in this village is suitable for cotton cultivation. In 1951, the People's Government called for expanding cotton fields, and the cotton fields in this village reached 828.9 mu, accounting for 66 percent of the total cultivated area. Cotton cultivation has become the specialized production of the farmers in this village.

II. Increasing Production is Based on Solid Foundations and Conditions

Immediately after liberation, the lack of production tools and labor force caused great difficulties for the recovery and development of production in this village. After the land reform, the liberated peasants, under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, implemented the policy of "organizing, overcoming difficulties, and developing production," and finally overcame all disasters. Now the production level of the whole village has far exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War.

The development of production is reflected in the increase in the total value of production and the increase in yield per unit area. In 1951, the village achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the total value of various crops reaching 486 million yuan, exceeding the pre-war level (178 million yuan) by 1.7 times and exceeding the pre-liberation level (135 million yuan) by 2.6 times. The yield per unit area increased significantly: the average yield of unginned cotton per mu of dry land was 156 jin, exceeding the pre-war level by 123 percent; the average yield of unginned cotton per mu of irrigated land was 443 jin, exceeding the pre-war level by 72 percent. According to the bumper harvest standard set by the government last year, those whose cotton fields on irrigated land yielded more than 420 jin per mu accounted for 56 percent of the village's irrigated cotton fields; those whose dry land yielded more than 200 jin per mu accounted for 31 percent of the village's dry cotton fields. Among the cotton-growing households in the village, 75 households reached the bumper harvest standard. There are also bumper harvest models for other crops such as wheat and millet. Yanjia Village received the honorary title of "Model Village of Abundant Harvests" from the Central People's Government this year, which greatly encouraged the farmers in the village. However, the farmers in the village did not become arrogant or complacent because of this. On the basis of the bumper harvest in 1951, they put forward the patriotic production increase competition goal for 1952: 800 jin of cotton per mu of bumper harvest land, an average of 500 jin of cotton per mu of general irrigated land, an increase of 12.8 percent compared to last year, and an average of 180 jin of cotton per mu of dry land, an increase of 15.3 percent compared to last year. In order to further achieve bumper harvest results, the cotton farmers in the village carefully studied Qu Yaoli's cotton cultivation method and launched a warm and practical competition movement.

The main reasons for Yanjia Village's bumper harvest are: the correct leadership and support of the Party and the government, the implementation of patriotic bumper harvest education, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the active leadership of labor models. The technical and material reasons are as follows:

First, using scientific technology and implementing intensive farming: Under the call and education of the government, the farmers in the village generally believe in and have begun to use scientific technology. This year, all cotton seeds have been soaked in warm water, and more than 80 percent have been treated with "Ceresan"; in order to eliminate cotton aphids at any time, the masses have begun to make their own cotton oil soap. In terms of cultivation, wheat fields were generally plowed three times in the past, but now some are plowed seven times, and at least five times. Cotton fields are generally plowed five or six times, harrowed four or five times, and rolled four or five times. The level of cultivation is far higher than before the war.

Second, increasing the application of fertilizer and improving the quality of fertilizer: In 1951, the average application of base fertilizer per mu of cotton field was more than 3,000 jin. This year, the average application of base fertilizer per mu of irrigated land is more than 7,000 jin, and the average application of base fertilizer per mu of dry land is more than 5,000 jin. The amount of commercial fine fertilizer has increased: in 1951, 55 cotton bumper harvest households applied a total of 1,805 jin of black beans, 990 jin of fertilizer field powder, and 222 jin of soybean cake. In 1952, the whole village applied a total of 18,000 jin of soybean cake, 7,035 jin of black beans, and 16,910 jin of fertilizer field powder.

Third, expanding the irrigated area and using water rationally: Before liberation, the village had 212 mu of irrigated land. In 1951, it was developed to 393 mu, and now it has 477 mu, accounting for 38 percent of the total cultivated area. In order to fight drought, the farmers in the village are carrying out the well-dredging work of 28 wells, which can expand the irrigated area by at least 100 mu. The total average irrigated area per person in the village is more than one mu. Labor model Shao Shuanghe created the double-wheel irrigation method, which made the use of water more rational and expanded the irrigated area.

Fourth, increasing investment and expanding reproduction: Due to the development of production, the farmers have the ability to expand reproduction. We conducted a typical survey of 12 households. In 1951, the average production investment per household was 2.72 million yuan, accounting for 31 percent of the total expenditure; the average investment of bumper harvest model households such as Shao Shuanghe and Shi Caigui was more than 6.49 million yuan, accounting for 41 percent of the total expenditure; the amount of investment increased in 1952. The whole village purchased more commercial fertilizer and added six waterwheels. According to a survey of eight typical households, if the purchasing power index of production materials in 1937 is 100, then it was 630.44 in 1951 and 673.74 in 1952.

With the development of production, the lives of the farmers have generally improved. Before liberation, most of the households in the village were short of food, and two-thirds of the farmers' food was corn. In 1949, only three households in the village had surplus grain and capital, while 92 households had agricultural income insufficient to maintain their lives, accounting for 76 percent of the total number of households. This situation fundamentally changed in 1951: only eight households were temporarily unable to maintain their lives, while 83 households had surplus grain and capital, accounting for 66.6 percent of the total number of households; the average annual consumption of oil per person in the village was 6.5 jin, and the average consumption of meat was 3.4 liang. This village is accustomed to weaving homespun cloth. Last year, the whole village still purchased more than 30 bolts of black foreign cloth, averaging 28 chi per household. Now the whole village has about 70 thermos bottles, 96 flashlights, and 104 pairs of sneakers and rain boots. These things that the masses had never used or seen in the past are now almost universally purchased. This is a significant sign of the improvement of farmers' lives.

III. Rapid Development of Mutual Aid and Cooperation, Moving Towards Comprehensive Cooperation

In 1950, the village had three long-term mutual aid teams and one labor exchange team. The two mutual aid teams led by labor models Shao Shuanghe and Shi Caigui achieved unprecedented bumper harvest results in two years. The average yield of cotton on irrigated land in Shao Shuanghe's team was 549 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 120 percent and exceeding the yield of individual households in the same year by 19 percent; the average yield of cotton on dry land was 258 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 153 percent and exceeding the yield of individual households in the same year by 65 percent. This vivid fact made the masses realize the superiority of organizing. Last year, the village developed into five long-term mutual aid teams and one labor exchange team. These teams can implement the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit and have established reasonable systems. This village launched an organized drought prevention and resistance movement this spring, and the masses have realized more deeply that organization plays a great role, and the mutual aid movement has developed more rapidly. Now the village has 19 mutual aid teams and one agricultural production cooperative. One hundred and eleven households are organized, accounting for 88 percent of the total number of households, 274 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, accounting for 89.8 percent of the total number of laborers, 1128.9 mu of irrigated and dry land, accounting for 90 percent of the total cultivated area of the village, and 49 head of livestock, accounting for 94.2 percent of the total number of livestock in the village.

On the basis of the mutual aid teams, labor model Shi Caigui founded an agricultural production cooperative this spring. The facts in just a few months have shown that the agricultural production cooperative has greater superiority than the mutual aid team. Shi Caigui Agricultural Production Cooperative has used surplus labor to carry out a large amount of land processing, collective well-digging, purchasing waterwheels, expanding irrigated land, and has also opened a mill and is preparing to open a tofu shop to increase production income. This is extremely enlightening to other mutual aid teams. At present, the cooperative production organization has an absolute advantage in the village. As the masses' awareness gradually increases, coupled with the superior conditions in all aspects of the village, as long as leadership is strengthened, agricultural production cooperatives will soon develop throughout the village.

In the past two years, due to the influence of the mutual aid teams and the leadership of the CCP branch, supply and marketing cooperatives have also developed rapidly. Now the supply and marketing cooperative has 272 members, accounting for 88 percent of the population over 16 years old in the village. Most of the members' means of production and means of livelihood are purchased through the cooperative. This spring, the supply and marketing cooperative's pre-purchase of cotton laid the foundation for the farmers in the village to combine production and supply and marketing. In the future, if farmers can sign long-term supply and marketing contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative, agricultural production and supply and marketing cooperation will be fully combined.

The farmers in this village have an average surplus grain and capital equivalent to 11.8 shi of wheat per household; but at the same time, a few households are unable to invest in production or have temporary difficulties and need to borrow money. Because credit cooperation has not been implemented before, usury has appeared in the village, exploiting other villages; this not only restricts the production investment of this village, but also affects the production of other villages. At present, the masses urgently demand credit cooperation. Therefore, it is completely necessary to organize the farmers' own strength, revitalize finance, and find a way out for surplus grain and capital. In the future, the combination and common development of production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperation, and comprehensive cooperation will be realized soon.

IV. The Era When Farmers Have No Culture is About to Pass

After land reform and production development, farmers' lives have improved, and cultural education has also developed accordingly. Of the 82 poor peasants and farm laborers at the time of the land reform, 73 have now risen to become middle peasants; their children can now attend school. Of the 72 school-age children in the village, 65 have been enrolled. However, to turn the current primary school into a model complete primary school and implement a "five-year consistent system," much assistance is still needed.

The winter school in this village was transformed into a permanent people's school in the spring of 1951. After May 1 this year, the scale of the people's school has expanded even more. The people's school has set up cultural and general classes, with a total of 158 participants; all young and middle-aged people in the village, except for seven adults who cannot participate due to special circumstances, have participated in the people's school. Women have a higher enthusiasm for learning. If the quick literacy method is implemented in this village, illiteracy can be eliminated within one year.

In order to facilitate the masses' learning, Yanjia Village established a small library on May 1 this year. The library has newspapers and magazines such as Shanxi Daily, Farmers Daily, Shanxi Youth, North China People, Current Affairs Handbook, and Propaganda Handbook, and has recently purchased more than 200 books, mainly including: Mao Zedong's works in single editions, popular science small series, agricultural production pamphlets, Resist America, Aid Korea small series, comic strips, etc. Everyone can borrow them freely, and everyone has the opportunity to read. But in reality, not many people borrow them. In the future, it should be combined with studying current affairs, improving production technology and health knowledge to revitalize the small library.

Reading groups have been generally established and have been combined with mutual aid groups. In this way, patriotic production increase and political study can be more closely integrated.

Land reform liberated the productive forces of the countryside and also enlightened the wisdom of the farmers; after the political and cultural level of the farmers is improved, they will have infinite creativity in production. They now want to buy radios, hoping to hear news about current affairs and political events and creative inventions at any time.

Due to the development of production and the improvement of living standards, farmers have consciously liked cleanliness. The masses in the village stipulated that a general cleaning should be carried out on the first and fifteenth day of each month, and inspections should be carried out. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective, and the whole village has now shown a new atmosphere of cleanliness and hygiene.

Maternal and infant health care has begun to be held; there are two trained midwives in the village. Since the use of new methods of delivery, both mothers and infants have been very healthy. One family called the midwife only after the baby was born, and the baby died without rescue, giving the farmers a vivid lesson. In the future, vigorously advocating new methods of delivery will further guarantee thousands of new lives.

The agricultural production cooperative has begun to run a nursery during the busy farming season. This will give play to the strength of elderly women and make it easier for many women to participate in labor production and study culture and politics.

V. The Content of Political Life is Becoming Increasingly Rich

The People's Government of Yanjia Village, an administrative village, is composed of elections by the People's Representative Conference. One representative is produced for every 15 households to form the People's Representative Conference. The People's Representative Conference is the highest organ of power in the village. The Representative Conference elects six members of the village government and three chairmen and vice-chairmen. The People's Representative Conference is held once a month. However, there are no records of previous meetings, which is a shortcoming. According to the discussion, the main content of the meeting is: to check the implementation of resolutions, discuss major issues (such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, grain requisition, donations, preferential treatment, and patriotic production increase), and collect and reflect the opinions of the masses through representatives; the resolutions are submitted to the village government for research and implementation. Since the establishment of the government in 1950, the People's Representative Conference has been able to convene on schedule, earnestly perform its duties, supervise village affairs, and promote central work. The People's Representative Conference has played a huge role and has been unanimously supported by the masses. Everyone said: "Now it is different from the past. Everyone can ask about everything in the village." This has laid the foundation for holding the village People's Congress with universal suffrage of all the people in the village in the future to establish the village people's power.

The work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents in the village has formed a system, and the actual yield of the land cultivated by military dependents exceeds the general level. The Marriage Law has been basically implemented. However, due to the poor leadership of the Women's Federation, the status of women in the family is still not completely equal, and a new type of democratic and harmonious family has not yet appeared. In the future, as women participate in labor production and study culture and politics, and with the strengthening of leadership by the Party, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation to strive for women's equal status, this situation can be improved.

Due to the strengthening of political leadership by the Party organization, the general awareness of the masses in the village has been universally improved, and everyone cares about national affairs, and the political atmosphere is quite strong. The Party branch has twelve propagandists. Every third, sixth, and ninth day of the month, people's representatives convene discussion meetings in groups, and the propagandists make reports and organize discussions. The discussion meeting is short and intense; the masses reflect: "It doesn't take much time each time, and it solves a lot of problems." Villagers are used to discussions, and many people can automatically participate. Since the implementation of the "Patriotic Day" system, the content of the discussion meeting has become richer. The close combination of the two has promoted various central tasks and strengthened political and ideological education. The secretary of the Party branch has a very high prestige, strong leadership, and good coordination between the Party and the government. In the future, further giving play to the role of all Party members, people's representatives, and organizations such as the Youth League and the Women's Federation, and expanding democratic life, the progress of all work will be more guaranteed.

Yanjia Village has developed into a model village of abundant harvests after a series of movements such as land reform, Resist America, Aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, patriotic production increase, and mutual aid and cooperation. In the future, if leadership can be strengthened and necessary support can be given in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, it can completely become a new type of rural village in a New Democratic society. The development path and direction of Yanjia Village are completely in line with the development laws of a New Democratic society. In our great motherland, thousands of such new types of rural villages have appeared and will continue to appear.

    介绍一个丰产模范村——山西解县阎家村
    山西省人民政府财政经济委员会秘书长  杜任之
    我们在检查春耕时，根据新民主主义社会的新型农村的标准，考察了丰产模范村——阎家村。参加考察的，除山西省人民政府检查组人员外，还有中共解县委员会和解县人民政府的干部（他们是经常在这个村指导工作的）。
    一、惨痛的历史和基本情况
    阎家村是山西棉产区的一个有代表性的村子，获得了中央人民政府农业部给予的“丰产模范村”的光荣称号。这里气候温和，土地肥沃，具有发展农业（特别是植棉）的优越条件。在日寇阎匪统治时期，这些优越的自然条件，反成为农民趋于贫困的根源。因为肥田美地，多为恶霸地主巧取豪夺，集中在少数人之手。百分之三十以上的土地，操纵在占全村人数不到百分之五的地主、富农手中；其余百分之九十五以上的人口，仅有百分之六十的土地。解放前，阎家村在日寇、阎匪反动统治下所遭受到的破坏和摧残，十分严重：全村丧失了六十多个劳动力，只剩下八头牲畜、五辆水车、十张犁、四十张锄，二百多亩良田变成荒地。因此，全村大部分中农每年都要发生青黄不接的困难，八十二户贫、雇农，一年辛苦结果，不够半年生活。
    一九四七年三月解县得到解放，一九四九年解县进行了土地改革。从此，农民翻了身，作了主，一切都变了样。土地改革时，全村共一二○户（五四○人），其中地主、富农三户（城内的地主未计），中农三五户，贫雇农八二户；现在全村有一二六户，其中下降户和贫农一一户，中农一一五户（约有十分之一已上升为富裕中农），共有五五九人（男三○八、女二五一），男女全劳力和半劳力三○五个；大小牲畜五二头，水车三五辆，大车七辆，土地一二五○点二亩（土地改革时每人平均一点五七亩，现在经过开荒和评丈土地，土地数量有所增加，每人平均二点二亩）。
    这个村大部分土地适宜植棉。一九五一年人民政府号召扩大棉田，这个村的棉田达到八二八点九亩，占耕地总面积百分之六六。植棉已成为这个村的农民的专业生产。
    二、提高产量是有根据有条件的
    刚解放后，生产工具和劳动力的缺乏，曾给这个村的恢复和发展生产造成极大困难。经过土地改革，解放了的农民在共产党和人民政府的领导和扶植下，实行“组织起来，克服困难，发展生产”，终于战胜了一切灾害。现在全村的生产水平，已远远超过了抗日战争以前的水平。
    生产的发展，表现在生产总值的增加和单位面积产量的提高。一九五一年全村获得空前丰收，各种作物生产总值达四亿八千六百多万元，超过战前（一亿七千八百多万元）一点七倍，超过解放前（一亿三千五百多万元）二点六倍。单位面积产量显著提高：旱地每亩平均产籽棉一五六斤，超过战前百分之一二三；水地每亩平均产籽棉四四三斤，超过战前百分之七二。根据去年政府规定的丰产标准来衡量，水地棉田每亩产四百二十斤以上的，占全村水地棉田的百分之五十六；旱地每亩产二百斤以上的，占全村旱地棉田的百分之三十一。全村植棉户中，有七十五户达到丰产标准。其它小麦、谷子也都有丰产模范。阎家村在今年获得了中央人民政府给予的“丰产模范村”的光荣称号，这大大鼓励了全村农民。但全村农民并没有因此而骄傲自满，他们在一九五一年丰产的基础上，提出了一九五二年的爱国增产竞赛目标：丰产地每亩产棉八百斤，一般水地平均每亩产棉五百斤，较去年提高百分之一二点八，旱地平均每亩产棉一百八十斤，较去年提高百分之一五点三。为了进一步获得丰产成绩，全村棉农仔细学习了曲耀离的植棉法，展开了热烈而实际的竞赛运动。
    阎家村获得丰产的主要原因是：党和政府的正确领导和扶植，爱国丰产教育的贯彻，互助合作运动的发展和劳动模范的积极带头。而在技术和物质方面的原因，有以下四点：
    第一、使用科学技术，实行精耕细作：在政府号召和教育下，全村农民普遍相信并开始运用了科学技术。今年的棉籽全部实行了温汤浸种，其中百分之八十以上用“赛力散”拌种；为了随时消灭棉蚜，群众已开始自制棉油皂。在耕作方面，麦地从前一般犁三次，现在有犁七次的，最少也犁五次，棉地普遍都犁五、六次，耙四、五次，耱四、五次，耕作水平远远超过战前。
    第二、增施肥料并提高肥料质量：一九五一年每亩棉田平均施底肥三千多斤，今年每亩水地平均施底肥七千余斤，旱地每亩平均五千余斤。商品细肥增加了：一九五一年五十五个植棉丰产户共施用黑豆一八○五斤，肥田粉九九○斤，豆饼二二二斤。一九五二年全村共施用豆饼一万八千斤，黑豆七○三五斤，肥田粉一六九一○斤。
    第三、扩大了水田并合理使水：解放前全村水地二一二亩，一九五一年发展到三九三亩，现在有四七七亩，占耕地总面积百分之三十八。为了抗旱，全村农民正在进行二十八眼井的淘井工作，至少可扩大水田百余亩。合计全村平均每人有水地一亩多。劳动模范邵双合创造了双车浇地法，使水的使用更加合理，又扩大了浇地面积。
    第四、增加投资，扩大再生产：由于生产的发展，农民有了扩大再生产的能力。我们进行了十二户的典型调查，一九五一年，这十二户每户平均生产投资为二七二万元，占总支出百分之三十一；邵双合、史采贵等丰产典型户，每户平均投资六四九万多元，占总支出百分之四十一；一九五二年投资量增加了。全村购买了更多的商品肥料，还增加了六辆水车，又据八个典型户调查，如以一九三七年生产资料购买力指数为一○○，则一九五一年为六三○点四四，一九五二年为六七三点七四。
    随着生产的发展，农民的生活普遍地提高了。解放前全村缺粮户占绝大多数，农民的食粮有三分之二是玉茭。一九四九年全村有余粮余资的只有三户，农业收入不足以维持生活的却有九十二户，占总户数百分之七十六。这种情况到一九五一年根本改观了：一时不足维持生活的仅有八户，有余粮余资的已有八十三户，占总户数百分之六十六点六；全村每人平均一年食油六斤半，食肉三斤四两。这村是一个习于纺织土布的村子，去年全村仍购买黑洋布三十多匹，平均每户二十八尺。现在全村约有七十个暖水瓶，九十六个手电筒，一百零四双球鞋、雨鞋。这些群众在过去根本没有用过或没有见过的东西，现在几乎普遍购用了。这是农民生活提高的显著标志。
    三、互助合作迅速发展，走向全面合作化
    一九五○年全村有三个长期互助组、一个变工组。劳动模范邵双合、史采贵领导的两个互助组在两年内都获得了空前的丰产成绩。邵双合组的水地棉，平均每亩产量五四九斤，超过战前百分之一百二十，超过单干户同年产量百分之十九；旱地棉平均每亩产量二五八斤，超过战前百分之一百五十三，超过单干户同年产量百分之六十五。这种活的事实使群众认识了组织起来的优越性。去年全村发展到五个长期互助组、一个变工组。这些组都能贯彻等价互利的原则，并且建立了合理的制度。这个村在今春开展了组织起来防旱抗旱运动，群众更加体会到组织起来作用大，互助运动更迅速地发展起来。现在全村有十九个互助组、一个农业生产合作社。组织起来一百一十一户，占总户数百分之八十八，男女全劳力和半劳力二百七十四个，占劳力总数百分之八十九点八，水旱地一千一百二十八点九亩，占全村耕地总面积百分之九十，牲畜四十九头，占全村牲畜总数百分之九十四点二。
    在互助组的基础上，劳动模范史采贵在今年春天创办了农业生产合作社。短短几个月的事实，说明了农业生产合作社比互助组具有更大的优越性。史采贵农业生产合作社已用剩余劳力进行大量的土地加工，集体打井，购买水车，扩大水地，还开设了磨房，筹备开豆腐房，增加生产收入。这对于其他互助组的启发作用是极大的。目前互助合作的生产组织，在村中已占绝对优势。由于群众觉悟程度逐步提高，加上全村各方面的优越条件，只要加强领导，农业生产合作社将会很快地在全村发展起来。
    两年来，由于互助组的影响和中共党支部的领导，供销合作社也很快地发展起来了。现在供销社的社员已达二百七十二人，占全村十六岁以上人数的百分之八十八。社员们的生产资料和生活资料，大都经过合作社购买。今春供销社预购棉花，更奠定了这个村的农民把生产和供销结合起来的基础。今后农民如能和供销社订立长期的供销结合合同，农业生产和供销合作就会全面结合起来。
    这个村的农民，余粮余资，平均每户已经有了相当十一石八斗小麦的余粮余资；但同时也有少数户无力投资生产或有临时困难，需要借债。由于以前没有实行信用合作，村里出现了高利贷，对其他村进行了剥削；这就不仅限制了本村的生产投资，同时也影响了其他村的生产。目前群众已迫切要求信用合作。为此，组织农民自己的力量，活跃金融，同时为余粮余资找出路，是完全必要的。今后生产、供销、信用三种合作相互结合，共同发展，全面合作化，将会很快地实现。
    四、农民没有文化的时代快要过去了
    经过土地改革和生产发展，农民生活改善了，文化教育也随着发展起来了。土地改革时的八十二户贫雇农，现在已有七十三户上升为中农；他们子弟已都能入学。全村学龄儿童七十二人，入学的已有六十五人。但要把目前的小学校办成模范完全小学，实行“五年一贯制”，还需大力帮助。
    这村的冬学已在一九五一年春转为常年民校，今年“五一”以后，民校的规模更有扩展。民校设立了文化、普通两班，参加人数合计一百五十八人；全村除七个壮年，因特殊情况不能参加外，全部青壮年已参加民校。妇女学习情绪较高。如果在这村实行速成识字法，一年之内可以扫除文盲。
    为了便于群众学习，阎家村在本年五月一日成立了小型图书馆。馆内有山西日报、农民报、山西青年、华北人民、时事手册、宣传手册等报纸杂志，最近又购书二百多册，主要的有：毛泽东著作单行本、科学普及小丛书、农业生产小册子、抗美援朝小丛书、连环画等。大家可以自由借阅，人人都有阅读机会。但实际上借阅的人还不很多。今后应结合学习时事、提高生产技术和卫生知识，把小图书馆活跃起来。
    读报组已普遍建立，并已和互助组合一。这样，爱国增产和政治学习更可密切地结合。
    土地改革解放了农村的生产力，也启发了农民的智慧；农民的政治和文化水平提高后，将在生产上更有无穷尽的创造。他们现在要求购买收音机，希望能随时听到时事政治和创造发明的消息。
    由于生产发展，生活提高，农民已经自觉地喜欢清洁了。全村群众规定：每月初一、十五实行大扫除，并进行检查。实行以来，颇有成效，现在全村已现出清洁卫生的新气象。
    妇婴保健已开始举办；全村有两个受过训练的接产士。自用新法接产以来，产妇婴儿都很健康。有一家婴儿落地后才叫接产士，婴儿无救而死，给予农民以活的教训。今后再大力提倡新法接产，千百个新生命就更加有了保证。
    农业生产合作社已开始举办农忙托儿所。这将发挥老年妇女的力量，使许多妇女便于参加劳动生产，学习文化政治。
    五、政治生活的内容日益丰富
    阎家村行政村的人民政府，是由人民代表会议选举组成的。每十五户产生一个代表，组成人民代表会议。人民代表会议是全村最高权力机关。由代表会议选出村政府委员六人、正副主席三人。人民代表会议每月举行一次。但历次会议都没有记录，是一个缺点。据谈会议主要内容是：检查决议执行情况，讨论重大问题（如镇压反革命、征粮、捐献、优抚和爱国丰产等问题），并通过代表搜集和反映群众意见；决议交由村政府研究执行。自一九五○年建政以来，人民代表会议能按期召开，认真执行职务，监督村政，推动中心工作。人民代表会议发挥了巨大作用，因而得到了群众一致拥护。大家说：“现在和过去不同了，村上的一切事情，大家都可以过问了。”这已为将来举行村人民代表大会建立全村人民普选的村人民政权奠定了基础。
    全村优待军属工作已形成制度，为军属代耕的土地实产量超过一般水平。婚姻法基本上已经贯彻。但是，由于妇联领导较差，妇女在家庭地位仍然不是完全平等的，民主和睦的新型家庭还没出现。今后随着妇女参加劳动生产和学习文化、政治，由党、团和妇联加强领导，争取妇女平等地位，这种情况是可以改进的。
    由于党的组织加强了政治领导，全村群众觉悟普遍提高，人人关心国家大事，政治空气相当浓厚。党支部有十二个宣传员，每逢三、六、九日，由人民代表分片召开座谈会，由宣传员作报告并组织讨论。座谈会时间短而紧张；群众反映：“每次费时不多，解决问题不少。”村民已习惯座谈，有不少人能自动参加。自“爱国日”制度推行后，座谈会的内容更加丰富。两者密切结合，推动了各项中心工作，加强了政治思想教育。党支部书记威信很高，领导很强，党政配合得也好。今后进一步发挥全体党员、各个人民代表和青年团、妇联等团体的作用，扩大民主生活，一切工作的进步将更有保证。
    阎家村经过土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国丰产、互助合作等一系列运动，已发展为丰产模范村，今后如能加强领导，从政治、经济、文化各方面再给以必要的扶植，便可以完全成为一个新民主主义的新型农村。阎家村发展的道路和方向，是完全合乎新民主主义社会发展规律的。在我们伟大的祖国，现已出现了并且还要继续不断出现千百万个这样的新型农村。    一九五二、六
