    Serious Gas Explosion Accident at Yangquan No. 4 Mine
    A serious explosion accident occurred on January 8th this year at the No. 4 Mine, which belongs to the Yangquan Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government. After the accident, the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council, together with the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and relevant units, sent personnel to the scene for inspection. With the approval of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, a circular on the handling of the Yangquan No. 4 Mine gas explosion was recently issued. The circular first pointed out that the gas explosion resulted in 14 deaths, 7 serious injuries, and 35 minor injuries. 1,000 support structures were destroyed, 45 connecting wall sections were destroyed, 3 air bridges and 6 air doors were destroyed, resulting in losses estimated at 480 million yuan, which greatly affected production and represented an extremely serious loss. After the accident, the joint inspection organized by the relevant organs and groups in the central, North China, Shanxi, and Yangquan areas assisted the mine in handling the aftermath in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" movement. Condolences and treatment were provided to the injured, and the families of the deceased were compensated in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations. Currently, most of the injured have recovered. The mine has also entered a stage of normal production.
    The circular pointed out: The cause of the accident was mainly the erroneous views of leading personnel at all levels below the Coal Mine Management Bureau, such as simply pursuing tasks, being negligent and careless, neglecting to rely on workers and implement the policy of safe production, as well as serious sloppy and irresponsible work styles. As early as the summer of 1951, Soviet experts had suggested improving ventilation, and the factory and mine leaders had also formulated an improvement plan, which was approved by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, but the improvement plan was not fully implemented because it was not resolutely implemented. The amount of gas in the old method mining area exceeded the limits of the safety regulations, and blasting was still being carried out, and because of the emphasis on reducing costs, black gunpowder and open-flame fuses were used. On the new coal mining face, 220-volt lamps without explosion-proof devices were used. In the ventilation safety system, many were controlled counter-revolutionary party members. There was a lack of strong institutional guarantees and political work guarantees regarding safe production. Therefore, workers reflected: "Since September of last year, the leadership has only emphasized tasks and paid no attention to workers' safety, violating the policy of safe production."
    The circular pointed out: In order to implement the policy of safe production and prevent the recurrence of such phenomena, after reporting to and obtaining approval from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the personnel involved in this incident will be given the following punishments according to the magnitude of their responsibilities: Liu Xiangsan, Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, should make a profound self-criticism; Song Zhichun, Deputy Director, will be given a warning; Bai Youzhi, Director of the Yangquan Mining Bureau, will be given a major demerit; Ren Zhengwu, Director of the No. 4 Mine, and Wen Jia, First Deputy Director, will be demoted; Wu Fengnian, Second Deputy Director, will be given two major demerits; Li Fengnian, head of the Ventilation Section of the mine, will be immediately dismissed and handed over to the judicial organs for punishment.
    Based on the experiences and lessons of this incident, the circular finally made three suggestions to factories and mines in various regions:
    (1) In order to rely on workers and implement the policy of safe production, all factories and mines must further implement democratic reforms on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, thoroughly eliminate bureaucracy in enterprises, purify the ranks of the working class, mobilize the broad masses of workers, and implement genuine democratic management.
    (2) Strictly implement the safe production responsibility system, clarify responsibilities, and be responsible at each level. Leaders at all levels should conduct supervision and inspection at any time.
    (3) The leading institutions of factories and mines at all levels must arrange safety work when deploying production tasks, attach great importance to the lives and health of workers, and improve equipment, operating techniques, systems, and organization to ensure safe production. Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, safety education should be deepened, and a mass safety production movement should be created.

### 阳泉四矿发生严重的瓦斯爆炸事故

    阳泉四矿发生严重的瓦斯爆炸事故
    中央人民政府燃料工业部阳泉矿务局所属之四矿，在今年一月八日发生了严重的爆炸事故。政务院人民监察委员会在事故发生后，特会同中央人民政府燃料工业部及各有关单位派员赴现场进行了检查，并报经中央人民政府政务院批准，在最近发出关于阳泉四矿瓦斯爆炸事件处理通报。通报首先指出，此次瓦斯爆炸事件，计死亡十四人、重伤七人、轻伤三十五人，炸倒棚子一千架、炸毁贯眼墙四十五个、风桥三个、风门六座，损失约值四亿八千万元，影响生产很大，损失极为严重。事故发生后，中央及华北、山西、阳泉等地各有关机关团体共同组织的联合检查，曾协助该矿结合“三反”运动进行善后处理；对伤员进行了慰问、治疗，对死者已按照劳动保险条例进行了抚恤。目前伤员已大部痊愈。该矿也已进入正常生产的阶段。
    通报指出：发生此次事故的原因，主要是煤矿管理总局以下各级领导人员存在着单纯追求任务，麻痹大意，忽视依靠工人、贯彻安全生产的方针等错误观点以及严重的粗枝大叶、不负责任的工作作风。远在一九五一年夏季，苏联专家即已建议改善通风情况，厂矿领导上亦曾拟定了改进计划，并报经中央人民政府燃料工业部批准，但因没有坚决贯彻执行，致使改进计划未能全部实现。旧法回采区瓦斯量超过保安规程的限度，仍在放炮，并由于强调减低成本，竟使用黑火药明火引线。在新采煤工作面上则用无防炸装置的二二○电压灯。通风安全系统中，不少是被管制的反动党团分子，有关安全生产方面，更缺少强有力的制度保证及政治工作保证。因此，工人反映：“自去年九月后，领导上只强调任务，不注意工人安全，违背了安全生产的方针。”
    通报指出：为了贯彻安全生产的方针，防止此类现象继续发生，经报请中央人民政府政务院批准后，特对与此次事件有关的人员，根据其应负责任的大小，分别给予下列处分：中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局局长刘向三应作深刻检讨，副局长宋之春予以警告处分，阳泉矿务局局长白犹之着记大过一次，四矿矿长任正午、第一副矿长文甲予以降职处分，第二副矿长武凤年记大过二次，该矿通风股股长李凤年着即撤职送交司法机关惩办。
    通报最后根据此次事件的经验教训，对各地厂矿提出了三点建议：
    （一）为了依靠工人，贯彻安全生产方针，各厂矿企业必须在“三反”运动的基础上，进一步贯彻民主改革，彻底肃清企业中的官僚主义，纯洁工人阶级队伍，发动广大工人群众，实行名符其实的民主管理。
    （二）严格贯彻安全生产责任制，明确责任，逐级负责。各级领导应随时进行督促检查。
    （三）各级厂矿企业领导机构在布置生产任务时必须布置保安工作，高度重视工人的生命和健康，从设备上、操作技术上、制度上、组织上加以改进，保证安全生产。并应定期进行安全大检查，深入安全教育，造成群众性的安全生产运动。
