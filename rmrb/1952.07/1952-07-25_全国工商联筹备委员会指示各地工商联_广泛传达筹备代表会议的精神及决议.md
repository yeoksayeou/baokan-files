    The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Instructs Local Federations of Industry and Commerce to Widely Disseminate the Spirit and Resolutions of the Preparatory Representative Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee issued instructions on the 15th of this month to local federations of industry and commerce and preparatory committees of federations of industry and commerce regarding the dissemination of the spirit and resolutions of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Representative Meeting. The instructions stated that, in order to enable industrialists and businessmen across the country to understand the spirit and resolutions of this meeting, it is necessary to widely and deeply disseminate them, and to implement the following three requirements: (1) Affirm the necessity and correctness of the "Five-Anti" movement, and its great significance for China's economic construction and the future of private industry and commerce. Consolidate the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement and ensure that the "five poisons" are not committed again. (2) Recognize the status and responsibilities of industrialists and businessmen in New China, strengthen the study of the Common Program, and promote the enthusiasm for production and operation. (3) Strengthen unity and organization, and, in accordance with the basic spirit of this meeting, rectify, improve, and establish the organizations of local federations of industry and commerce in a guided and step-by-step manner.
    The instructions pointed out that the content of the dissemination should include three aspects: the significance, process, and achievements of the meeting, and the future direction of efforts for industrialists and businessmen. These disseminations should focus on three documents: the opening speech by Chairman Chen Shutong, the speech by Director Chen Yun of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and the closing speech by Representative Li Zhuchen. After local federations of industry and commerce or preparatory committees of federations of industry and commerce conduct dissemination, they should organize all industrialists and businessmen to study, clarify their understanding of the future direction of efforts. If there is already a unified learning leadership organization in the local business community, the main documents of this meeting should be used as the main learning content for the business community in the near future, and learning should be arranged. Learning must be linked to reality, linked to the thoughts of industrialists and businessmen themselves, and discussions should be展开 (zhǎnkāi - "unfold, launch"). Finally, a good summary should be made and reported to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee.

    【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会本月十五日向各地工商联及工商联筹备会发出关于传达全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议精神及决议的指示。指示提出：为使全国工商业者了解这次会议的精神和决议，必须广泛、深入地进行传达，并贯彻下列三点要求：（一）肯定“五反”运动的必要性与正确性，及其对我国经济建设与私营工商业前途的重大意义。巩固“五反”胜利，保证不再犯“五毒”。（二）认清工商业者在新中国的地位及责任，加强学习共同纲领，发扬生产经营的积极性。（三）加强团结组织，并本着这次会议的基本精神，有领导、有步骤地整顿、健全与建立各地工商业联合会的组织。
    指示指出传达内容应包括会议意义、经过、成就及工商业者今后努力方向等三方面。这些传达应以陈叔通主席的开幕辞、政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任的讲话和李烛尘代表的闭幕辞三个文件为中心。各地工商联或工商联筹备会进行传达后，应组织全体工商业者进行学习，明确认识今后努力方向。如当地工商界已有统一的学习领导机关，就应将这次会议的主要文件，作为工商界最近期内主要学习内容，布置学习。学习必须联系实际，联系工商业者自己的思想，展开讨论；最后作好总结，汇报全国工商联筹备委员会。
