    The "full load, over-axle, 500 kilometer" movement has been universally launched in the national railway system, powerfully promoting the development of railway transportation capacity. In May, the nation's locomotives collectively exceeded the axle load limit (i.e., hauling more than the prescribed limit) by 549.129 million ton-kilometers, an average increase of 209.3 percent compared to March, and 159.4 percent compared to April. The average traction tonnage of freight locomotives increased by 69.3 tons compared to March, and 59 tons compared to April. As a result of exceeding the axle load limit, the equivalent of 3,633 fewer trains were run in May, saving 35 assigned locomotives, 65,632 man-hours of maintenance time, 19,219 tons of locomotive fuel coal, and 11,574 kilograms of grease. Under-axle (i.e., hauling less than the prescribed amount) trains decreased by 6.5 percent in May compared to April.

    The vast majority of regions in the national railway system are carrying out the "full load, over-axle, 500 kilometer" movement in a planned, led, and organized manner, and the wisdom and labor enthusiasm of the masses have been fully utilized. Therefore, new achievements have been made in all aspects of railway production, especially in exceeding the axle load limit. In May, 50 percent of the drivers in the China Changchun Railway Administration pulled over-axle trains, exceeding the axle load limit by a total of 11.317 million ton-kilometers. The Tianjin Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration exceeded the axle load limit by 26.3 million ton-kilometers in the first ten days of June. Significant progress has also been made by units under the Shanghai, Hengyang, and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations. Such a large-scale over-axle fact effectively criticizes all kinds of bureaucratic, conservative, and departmentalist thinking and technical viewpoints that are based on narrow experience and the bourgeois theories of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to ensure the smooth development of the "full load, over-axle, 500 kilometer" movement, other business departments have also improved production. The Tianjin Vehicle Depot found 405 ways to improve efficiency in May. Gao Baoshan of the carpentry team in the freight car workshop made a model of a freight car door, which doubled work efficiency. Shen Baofa, Zhou Heshang, and three others from the Nanjing Vehicle Depot of the Shanghai Railway Administration created a new method to change the internal passage of the K-type three-way valve, so that the pressure reduction during train braking is consistent from front to back, solving the difficulties of stopping long trains. This creation has made a great contribution to the over-axle movement.

    However, the development of the "full load, over-axle, 500 kilometer" movement is still uneven across the country. The main reason is that some cadres in some regions have insufficient understanding of the purpose of this movement, which is to drive all departments related to railway operations to unleash transportation potential and accumulate more wealth for the country. Many people still excessively emphasize the limitations of objective conditions such as poor line equipment. Therefore, instead of actively improving the operating skills of crew members, the command ability of dispatchers, and the quality of lines, they lack confidence and courage in exceeding the axle load limit. In some areas, the organization and planning of this movement are insufficient, and the technical preparations are inadequate, resulting in a phenomenon where drivers blindly haul more based only on enthusiasm, and then drop it if they can't pull it. This practice not only hinders transportation order, but also affects traffic safety. In response to this situation, the Ministry of Railways issued the "Provisional Measures for Over-Axle Rewards" and the "Measures for the Marshalling and Operation of Over-Axle Trains" in early June to guide the movement onto the right track.

### 全国铁路普遍展开满载超轴五百公里运动  运动发展不平衡地区应注意发挥运输潜在能力

    全国铁路普遍展开满载超轴五百公里运动
    运动发展不平衡地区应注意发挥运输潜在能力
    超轴、满载、五百公里运动已在全国铁路系统普遍展开，有力地推动了铁路运输力的发展。五月份全国机车共超轴（即比规定多拉）五亿四千九百十二点九万吨公里，较三月份平均提高了百分之二百零九点三，较四月份提高了百分之一百五十九点四。货物机车平均牵引吨数较三月份提高六十九点三吨，较四月份提高五十九吨。由于超轴的结果，在五月份等于少开三千六百三十三个列车，节省配属机车三十五台，节省检修时间六万五千六百三十二个工时，节省机车运转用煤一万九千二百一十九吨，油脂一万一千五百七十四公斤。欠轴（即拉的不足规定数量）列车，五月份较四月份减少了百分之六点五。
    全国铁路绝大多数地区是有计划、有领导、有组织地开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的，群众的智慧和劳动热情得到充分发挥，因此在铁路生产的各方面都获得了新的成绩。特别是超轴方面。中长铁路管理局在五月份有百分之五十的司机牵引超轴列车，共超轴一万一千三百一十七万吨公里。天津铁路管理局天津分局在六月上旬十天之内超轴牵引二千六百三十万吨公里。上海、衡阳、郑州铁路管理局所属单位也同样有显著进展。这样大规模的超轴事实有力地批判了那些以狭隘的经验和英美等国资产阶级的理论作依据的形形色色的官僚主义、保守主义、本位主义思想和技术观点。为了要保证满载、超轴、五百公里运动的顺利开展，其他各业务部门也改进了生产。天津车辆段五月份共找窍门四百零五件，货车间木工组高宝山作了一个货车车门的模型，使工作效率提高一倍。上海铁路管理局南京车辆段沈宝发、周和尚等五人创造出一种新办法，改变K型三通阀内部通路，使列车制动时能前后减压一致，解决了长大列车停车的困难。这一创造对超轴运动贡献很大。
    但是目前全国铁路满载、超轴、五百公里运动的发展情况还不平衡。主要是有些地区干部对这一运动的目的在于带动铁路所有行车的有关部门，发挥运输潜在能力，为国家积累更多财富认识不足。不少人还过分强调线路设备不好等客观条件的限制，因而他们不从积极的提高乘务员的操纵技术和调度人员的指挥能力和线路质量着手，反而对超轴缺乏信心和勇气。还有些地区因这一运动的组织性、计划性不够，技术方面的准备工作不足，产生司机仅凭热情盲目的多拉，拉不了再甩的现象。这种做法不但妨碍了运输秩序，而且已经影响行车安全。针对这种情况铁道部曾于六月初颁行了“超轴奖励暂行办法”和“超轴列车的编组及运行办法”，把运动导向正轨。（新华社）
