Lecture 4: The Causes of Pain During Childbirth and Methods to Eliminate It

Since pregnancy and childbirth are so natural and reasonable, why did women experience pain before the implementation of the painless childbirth method?

We know that there are two elements that constitute the sensation of pain: first, external stimuli, and second, the nervous system that receives the stimuli. The pain sensation produced by the nervous system receiving stimuli is completed by two links of the nervous system: one is the sensory receptor of the nerve endings and afferent fibers, and the other is the center of the nervous system, namely the brain. Only when the nerve endings feel external stimuli can pain be produced. Although the pain sensation is the result of brain analysis, we usually do not feel pain in the brain, but only in the stimulated area. This is a special phenomenon of the nervous system. This phenomenon is very beneficial to living beings because it can be used to determine the location of the stimulus, thereby avoiding or eliminating it.

Precisely because the pain sensation comes from the nerve endings' receptors and the brain, we can use various methods to anesthetize the nerve endings' receptors or the brain to eliminate the pain sensation.

In different parts of the body, the same stimulus often causes pain of varying degrees of intensity. The main reason lies in the nerve endings' receptors. All parts of the human body have nerve endings' receptors, but their sensitivity is different. Some parts (such as fingers) are very sensitive to pain, while others (such as heels) are very insensitive to pain. The pain sensation of the internal organs' receptors is the most insensitive. Although the signals of general stimuli received by them can also be transmitted to the brain, they cannot reach the degree of pain that we can be aware of. As for the female reproductive organs, especially the uterus or cervix, its expansibility, contractility, and nerve insensitivity are similar to those of general internal organs, or even exceed them. Therefore, we cannot find any reason for the occurrence of pain.

Perhaps some people will say: "Childbirth was indeed painful for women in the past. This is not a subjective fabrication by the women, but there is a reason for it."

That's right, the pain of childbirth in the past was a fact, and there was a reason for its occurrence. The cause of this pain is not in the nerves of the female reproductive organs, then it must be in the nerve center.

Now, let's talk about the relationship between the nerve center—the brain—and the pain of childbirth.

We often see that a stimulus that is sufficient to cause pain can sometimes cause very severe pain in different situations, and sometimes it does not cause pain. Take animals as an example, for instance, when a dog's skin is cut open under normal circumstances, it will cry out in pain; but when a group of dogs are fighting for food and are bitten until their skin is broken and bleeding, they do not feel any pain at all. Humans also have similar phenomena. This is due to mental diversion. The mind is, of course, a product of brain activity. Using the laws of mental diversion can turn real pain into no pain, which is certainly also the function of the brain.

Mental diversion is a psychological term. What is its essence? We can explain it through scientific experiments.

For example, when a dog uses its right foreleg to scratch its neck, if we prick its right hind leg with a needle, it will definitely stop scratching first, put down its right foreleg, and then lift its right hind leg to avoid the needle's stimulus. It is impossible for it to simultaneously lift its right foreleg to scratch and lift its right hind leg to avoid the needle prick. Why does one stimulus lose its effect of causing a reaction when two stimuli occur simultaneously? This is because the brain has two forms of activity and a relationship to reacting to external stimuli. The two activities of the brain are positive excitatory activity and negative inhibitory activity. When a dog's hind leg is stimulated, the part of the cerebral cortex corresponding to the hind leg produces positive excitatory activity, thus causing the action of lifting the hind leg. At this time, the part of the cerebral cortex corresponding to the neck, which was originally in an excitatory state, is transformed into a state of inhibitory activity and no longer reacts to external stimuli. Although this transformation of reaction is the function of the brain, from the outside it appears as if the itch stimulus has lost its effect.

The above experiment shows that stimulating the hind leg can only make the effect of stimulating the foreleg disappear, and has no other effect, and it is also temporary. That is to say, if the needle stops stimulating the hind leg, its foreleg will still be raised to scratch.

We can also give an example of a so-called conditioned reflex experiment. Using the function of the cerebral cortex can not only make the effect of a certain stimulus disappear, but also make it a thing that has another effect for a long time. Soviet scholar A.I. Yefeeva conducted the following experiment: While feeding a dog food, he stimulated the dog's skin with a weak electric current. At that time, it ignored the stimulation of the weak current, but ate the food and salivated. According to the general statement, in this case, the dog does not react to the electrical stimulation, but only diverts its attention to the reaction to the food. He gave it food while giving it an electric current stimulus every day. After repeated trials for several times, if the dog is stimulated by electric current without giving it food, the dog not only does not avoid the electric current stimulus, but also salivates and shows a reaction to the food. In repeated experiments, the intensity of the current accompanying the food was increased every day, until it increased to the point where it could burn the dog's skin. However, when such a strong electric current stimulated the dog's skin alone, it did not feel pain and avoid it, but still showed a reaction to food and drooled. From this experiment, we can see that something that causes pain, due to repeated combination with food, loses its original effect and becomes something that can cause saliva secretion like food.

Why doesn't the dog's brain have a painful reaction when it receives a signal from a strong electric current stimulus, but instead transfers this signal to the nerve center that manages saliva secretion, causing the saliva secretion center to react? In other words, how does the perception center lose its normal function when it is stimulated? The reason is that when different centers of the nervous system receive signals at the same time or continuously, the different centers form temporary functional connections. In this case, the excitation point of that center is consolidated and the stimulus received is strong. Therefore, that center shows a positive reaction, and although another center receives the stimulus, it cannot show its own inherent positive reaction, but can only help the center with a strong excitation point to produce a positive reaction. This phenomenon is called the law of dominance of nerve center activity. According to this principle, A.I. Yefeeva's experiment is not difficult to explain.

As mentioned above, when a dog undergoes an experiment, although the perception center of the brain receives a stimulus, it cannot produce a painful reaction. This does not mean that the activity of the perception center cannot react to the stimulus, but that it does not produce the painful reaction that should occur. Because the pain reaction often appears as an excitatory activity of the perception center. Another activity of the perception center is inhibitory activity. When inhibitory activity occurs, pain cannot be produced. That is to say, the perception center has two kinds of activities, one is negative inhibitory activity and the other is positive excitatory activity. Whether the pain is produced by the perception center directly receiving the stimulus signal depends entirely on which activity the stimulus signal causes in the perception center.

After we understand this principle, we can understand that the brain can change the lightness, heaviness, presence, and absence of pain according to certain conditions, and how the brain exerts its role in this aspect. At the same time, we also know how to artificially grasp this law of the brain to reduce pain.

Perhaps some people will ask: "Since scientific experiments can turn things that cause pain into things that cannot cause pain, can things that cannot cause pain be turned into things that can cause pain?"

Our answer is affirmative. Why? We know that when a dog's hind leg is stimulated with a needle, its hind leg reacts with avoidance due to pain, and its spleen also contracts. If we repeatedly show a red light in front of the dog at the same time as pricking its hind leg with a needle, then as long as the red light appears in front of the dog's eyes, its hind leg will be raised and its spleen will also contract. This shows that the red light has become a factor that causes pain.

Someone else asked: "What you said are all animal experiments. Are there such phenomena in human life?"

Our answer is again affirmative. There are such situations in human life. For example, people salivate as soon as they see a sour apricot.

Above, we talked about some of the similarities and differences between the activity patterns of the human brain and the animal brain. We know that humans are social creatures. The reason why people can speak is because the human brain has a special language system. Soviet biologist Pavlov called the language system in the human brain the second signal system, and the system in the human brain that is the same as the brain function of animals is called the first signal system. The first signal system can only reflect things that are seen, heard, or touched; the second signal system can reflect abstract things that have not been personally experienced through language or writing. In other words, humans can indirectly perceive the things of ancestors, others, or the future using language or writing. Therefore, we say that the second signal system is a higher-level thinking system. Although language is something that cannot be seen or touched, it is an objectively existing reflection and a conditioned stimulus. Therefore, the activity patterns of the first signal system and the activity patterns of the second signal system are basically the same. In other words, the second signal system also operates according to the laws of conditioned reflexes. Not only that, but the activity of the second signal system is built on the foundation of the first signal system, so their relationship is very close. Now we give an example to illustrate how a conditioned reflex established in the first signal system transmits the conditioned reflex to the second signal system. We can understand the relationship between the two signal systems from this example.

For example, we can use a "green light" to form a motor conditioned reflex for a child who is just entering school. Later, as long as we say "green light" to this child or show him a piece of paper with the words "green light" written on it, a positive motor reaction will occur. Similar experiments can also be done with a "bell."

From this experiment, we can see that the "green light" lamp, the "green light" language, and the "green light" text are integrated in the child's brain. The premise of the combination of the three is, of course, because the child has experienced in the process of life that the three are the same thing, except that the "green light" lamp is a physical object, and the "green light" language and the "green light" text are abstractions of the physical object. Therefore, any one of the three can cause the same effect. Although the effects caused by the three stimuli are the same, the dynamic transmission process of the reflex is different. The excitation process of the cerebral cortex caused by the "green light" stimulus is directly linked to the motor reaction process combined with it, but the excitation process of the cerebral cortex caused by the "language green light" and "text green light" stimuli first restores the imprint left in the cerebral cortex in the old past life process, and then can be linked to the motor reaction process.

The above example allows us to understand that a conditioned reflex established in the first signal system can be transmitted to the second signal system.

Here, we can also give an example to illustrate the language system's influence on the first signal system and the autonomic nervous system.

People who have lived in mountain villages know that the people there generally dare not eat fish, saying that fish are dirty insects in the water. Therefore, they are very reluctant for us to use their pots to cook fish. They feel nauseous when they see us eating fish. You see, isn't this a special phenomenon completely caused by language?

Secondly, some doctors say that the patient has lung disease before they have made a clear diagnosis; or when they diagnose that the patient has some lung disease phenomena, they do not pay attention to the patient's mental state or emotions, and announce the diagnosis result like a judge passing a sentence. As a result, the patient lies down, and the condition becomes more and more serious day by day. He doesn't want to eat, and he worries all day long, eventually leading to a serious illness. Isn't this the effect of language? On the contrary, many doctors often show optimism in front of patients, making the patients feel lighthearted in spirit, which promotes the efficacy of the medicine.

From here, we can be sure that things that are harmless (whether they have been experienced or not) can be turned into harmful things that cause disease through the effect of language.

After we understand the function of language, we can analyze the pain of childbirth. Soviet obstetricians have created a hypothesis to explain the cause of childbirth pain. Thousands of years ago, due to people's lack of health knowledge and the difficulties of social and material conditions, some women experienced pain during childbirth and even suffered misfortune. Therefore, everyone believes that women must experience pain during childbirth, which has formed a "linguistic conditioned reflex of childbirth pain" in all human beings. This is the historical process and root cause of the generation of childbirth pain.

Speaking of this, people may still not believe that language can have the power to turn human physiological phenomena into pathological phenomena. In fact, there is no need to doubt this. We know that there is a false pregnancy in women. This false pregnancy is caused by language. Pavlov wrote when commenting on false pregnancy: "At this time, the mammary glands actively start to work, and fat also begins to be deposited in the abdominal wall. You see, the human brain, human thought, human language, and the two hemispheres of the human brain have such a great stimulating effect on the purely autonomic nervous functions such as pregnancy and fat deposition."

Here, we have found the basic cause of childbirth pain and understand that childbirth pain is caused by the painful conditioned reflex caused by human language (i.e., education). We can use education to remove it.

The second factor that causes childbirth pain is the expectant mother's fear of childbirth. We know that when we have a fear of a certain stimulus or thing, our entire spirit is focused there. As a result, the brain's sensitivity to a certain stimulus is increased. The so-called increase in brain sensitivity means that the excitatory activity of a certain center of the brain occupies a dominant position. Before childbirth, the expectant mother has many concerns, such as worrying that the environment is not good; when she feels uterine contractions during childbirth, she thinks that pain and danger are coming and concentrates her entire spirit on the lower abdomen, wanting to discover the pain of childbirth. In this case, pain is bound to occur. After we understand this principle, on the one hand, the expectant mother must actively eliminate the fear; on the other hand, the obstetrician must do a good job and care for them meticulously, and never panic when encountering any situation in the delivery room. Only in this way can the expectant mother eliminate the fear of childbirth.

    无痛分娩法讲话
    刘民英
    第四讲  造成分娩疼痛的原因和消除分娩疼痛的方法
    既然妊娠或分娩是这样自然而合理，那么，在未实行无痛分娩法以前产妇为何发生疼痛呢？
    我们知道，构成疼痛的感觉有两个要素，第一是外界的刺激，第二是接受刺激的神经系统。神经系统接受刺激后所产生的痛觉，是由神经系统的两个环节所完成：一是神经末梢的感觉器和传入纤维，一是神经系的中枢，即大脑。神经末梢在感受到外界的刺激后，才能产生痛的感觉。虽然疼痛感觉是大脑分析的结果，但我们平常却不觉得大脑痛，而只是感到受刺激的局部痛。这是一种神经系的特殊现象。这种现象对生物很有好处，因为可以借这种现象来确定刺激的部位，从而躲避它或消除它。
    正因为痛觉是由神经末梢的感受器和大脑来的，所以要想消除痛觉，就可以用各种方法来麻醉神经末梢感受器或大脑。
    在身体的不同的部位，同样的刺激往往引起轻重不同的痛觉，主要原因在于神经末梢感受器。人体各部都有神经末梢感受器，但它们的感应性是不同的。有的部分（如手指）痛觉很灵敏，有的部分
    （如脚后跟）痛觉则很迟钝。内脏感受器的痛觉最为迟钝，虽然它所接受的一般刺激的信号也能传达到大脑，但是不能达到我们能意识到的疼痛的程度。至于女性的生殖器官，特别是子宫或子宫颈，它的扩张性和收缩性以及神经的迟钝性，和一般内脏相差不多，甚至还超过它们。因此，我们完全找不到发生疼痛的理由。
    也许有人要说：“以前妇女们分娩确实是疼痛的，这不是产妇们的主观虚构，是有理由的。”
    不错，以前的分娩疼痛是事实，有它发生的理由。这种疼痛发生的原因既不在女性生殖器的神经方面，那么，一定是在神经中枢方面。
    现在，我们就来谈谈神经中枢——大脑和分娩疼痛的关系。
    我们常常见到：足以惹起疼痛的刺激，在不同的情况下，有时可以引起很厉害的疼痛，有时不引起痛觉。先拿动物来说，例如平常把狗的皮肤割破时，它会痛的大叫；但当一群狗为争夺食物而咬得皮破血流时，却没有一点觉得疼痛的现象。人也有类似的现象。这是精神转移的关系。精神当然是大脑活动的产物，运用精神转移的规律能使真正的痛变成不痛，这当然也是大脑的作用。
    精神转移是一个心理学上的名词，它的本质到底是什么呢？我们可以通过科学的实验来加以说明。
    比如当一只狗用右前肢在颈部搔痒时，我们用针刺它的右后肢，这时，它一定先停止抓痒动作，把右前肢放下来，然后再抬起右后肢，以躲避开针的刺激，绝不能同时出现抬起右前肢抓痒，也抬起右后肢躲避针刺的现象。为什么两种刺激同时发生时一个刺激就失掉引起反应的作用呢？这是因为大脑有两种活动形式以及反应外界刺激的关系。大脑的两种活动，一是阳性兴奋性活动，一是阴性制止性活动。当狗的后肢被刺激时，与后肢相应的大脑皮质部分产生出阳性兴奋性活动，于是引起后肢抬起的动作，这时，原来处于兴奋性活动的与颈部相应的大脑皮质部，却转换成了制止性活动的状态，不再对外界的刺激发生反应。这种反应的变换现象，虽然是大脑的作用，但从外表看来，就等于痒的刺激失掉了作用似的。
    上述的实验，说明了刺激后肢只能使刺激前肢的作用消失，并无别的作用，而且也是暂时的。就是说，如果针停止刺激后肢，它的前肢还是要举起来搔痒的。
    我们还可以举出一种所谓条件反射的实验方法。运用大脑皮质的机能，不仅使某一种刺激的作用失掉，并且使它长期地变成有另一种作用的东西。苏联学者艾娄费耶娃曾作过如下的实验：他在给狗喂食物的同时，以弱电流刺激狗的皮肤，当时它不理会弱电流的刺激，而是吃食物，流唾液。照一般的说法，在这样情况下，狗对电流刺激不发生反应，而只将精神转移到对食物发生反应。每天在给予电流刺激的同时，给它喂食物。这样反复地经过数次试验后，如果当电流刺激狗的皮肤时，不再给予食物，狗不但不躲避电流刺激，而且照样地流唾液，出现对食物的反应。在反复的实验中，伴随食物的电流强度每天增加，一直增加到能烧破狗的皮肤。可是这样强的电流刺激在单独接触到狗的皮肤时，它并不感觉疼痛而躲避，还是照样地出现对食物的反应，口流唾液。从这个实验中，我们可以看到惹起疼痛的东西，由于和食物反复结合，失去了其原来的作用，变成了和食物一样的能引起唾液分泌的东西。
    狗的大脑接受了强电流刺激的信号，为何不发生痛的反应，反而把这个信号转移到管理唾液分泌的神经中枢，使唾液分泌中枢发生反应呢？换句话说，在知觉中枢受到刺激的情况下，知觉中枢如何失掉其正常的作用呢？原因是当神经系不同的中枢同时或继续分别接受到信号后，不同的中枢即发生暂时的机能联系，在这种情形下，那中枢的兴奋点是巩固的，所接受的刺激是强烈的。因此那个中枢即出现阳性反应，另一个中枢虽然接受刺激，但不能出现自己的固有阳性反应，而只能帮助兴奋点强的中枢发生阳性反应。这种现象，叫做神经中枢活动的优势定律。根据这个道理，艾娄费耶娃的实验就不难解释了。
    如上所述，当狗经过实验后，大脑的知觉中枢虽然接受到刺激，但不能出现痛觉的反应，这并不是说知觉中枢活动不能对刺激发生反应，而是没有发生应该发生的痛觉反应。因为痛觉反应往往是以知觉中枢的一种兴奋活动出现的。知觉中枢的另一种活动，是制止性活动，制止性活动出现时，痛觉即不能产生。这就是说，知觉中枢有两种活动，一种是阴性的制止性活动，一种是阳性的兴奋性活动，知觉中枢之所以直接受到刺激信号后而产生的痛或不痛，完全要看刺激信号对知觉中枢究竟引起那一种活动。
    我们明白这个道理后，就可了解到大脑根据一定的条件，能使疼痛的轻、重、有、无发生变化，以及大脑怎样地发挥它这方面的作用。同时，我们也知道如何人工地掌握大脑的这种规律，以减低疼痛。
    也许有人要问：“科学的实验，既然能够把惹起疼痛的东西变成不能惹起疼痛的东西，那末，是否可以把不能惹起疼痛的东西变成能惹起疼痛的东西呢？”
    我们的回答是肯定的。为什么？我们知道，用针刺激狗的后腿，它的后腿因疼痛而发生躲避的反应，并且它的脾脏也要收缩。假若我们多次地在用针刺其后腿的同时，就在狗面前摆出红灯，以后只要红灯在狗的眼前一出现，它的后腿即抬起来，并且它的脾脏也收缩。由此说明，红灯成了引起疼痛的因子。
    有人又要问了：“你说的都是动物实验，人类生活中有没有这种现象呢？”
    我们的回答又是肯定的，人类生活中也有这种情形。例如人们一看到酸杏，就流口水。
    上边我们谈到了关于人类大脑的活动规律和动物大脑的活动规律异同的一些问题。我们知道，人是社会的生物。人之所以能言语，是因为人的大脑有特殊的语言系统。苏联生物学家巴甫洛夫把人类大脑中的语言系统叫做第二信号系统，把人类的大脑机能和动物的大脑机能相同的系统，叫做第一信号系统。第一信号系统只能反映看到、听到或摸到的东西；第二信号系统，可以通过语言或文字，反映抽象的非亲身体验过的事物。换句话说，人类可以运用语言或文字间接地感知祖先的、别人的或未来的东西，因此我们说第二信号系统是高级的思惟系统。语言虽然是看不到摸不到的东西，但它却是客观存在的反映，也是一种条件刺激物。因此，第一信号系统的活动规律和第二信号系统的活动规律，基本上是相同的。换句话说，第二信号系统也是按照条件反射的法则进行活动的。不但如此，第二信号系统的活动是建筑在第一信号系统的基础上的，因此它们的关系是非常密切的。现在我们举一例子，说明一个建立在第一信号系统的条件反射如何把条件反射传递到第二信号系统。我们可以从这个例子认识到两个信号系统的关系。
    比如我们对一个初入学的小孩可以用“绿灯光”形成一种运动性条件反射。以后，只要对这个小孩说一声“绿光”或者给他看写着“绿光”两字的文字片，都会出现阳性运动性反应。用“铃”也可作成类似的实验。
    由这个实验，我们可以看到“绿光”的灯、“绿光”的语言、“绿光”的文字在小孩的大脑中是三位一体地结合着的。三者结合的前提，当然是由于小孩在生活过程中曾体验到三者是同一个东西，只不过“绿光”的灯是实物，“绿光”的语言和“绿光”的文字是实物的抽象。因此，三者中不论那一个，都可引起同一效果。虽然三种刺激所引起的效果是一样的，但反射的动力传递过程却是不一样的。“绿灯光”刺激所引起的脑皮质兴奋过程直接即与其结合的运动反应过程相联系，但“语言绿光”、“文字绿光”刺激所引起的脑皮质兴奋过程，首先使旧的以往的生活过程中脑皮质留下的烙印重新恢复联系，然后才能和运动反应过程联系。
    上述的例子，使我们了解到建立在第一信号系统的条件反射可以传递给第二信号系统。
    这里，我们还可以举出一个例子，说明语言系统影响第一信号系统和植物神经。
    在山村里住过的人都知道，那里的老百姓一般都不敢吃鱼，说鱼是水中的脏虫，因此，他们很不愿意我们用他们的锅煮鱼吃。他们看到我们吃鱼时心里就发呕。你们看，这不是完全由语言造成的特殊现象吗？
    其次，有些大夫在没有诊断清楚以前，就说患者有肺病；或者在诊断出患者有某些肺病的现象时，不注意患者的精神状态或情绪，就像下判决书似地宣布了诊断结果。这样一来，患者躺倒了，病情一天比一天重起来，饭也不想吃了，整天发愁，以致拖成重病。这不就是语言的作用吗？相反地，有很多大夫却在病人面前经常表现乐观，使患者在精神上觉得轻快，这样就促进了药物的疗效。
    我们从这里可以确信：本来是无害的东西（不论是体验过或是没有体验过的），只要通过语言的作用，就可以变成致病的有害的东西。
    我们了解了语言的作用以后，就可以分析分娩的疼痛了。苏联产科医生们创造了一个假说，来解释分娩疼痛的原因。在数千年以前，由于人们缺乏卫生知识和社会物质条件的困难，有一部分妇女在分娩中发生了疼痛，甚至遭到了不幸。于是大家就认为女人分娩一定要疼痛的，以致在全人类中形成了“语言性的分娩疼痛条件反射”。这就是分娩疼痛产生的历史经过和根源。
    说到这里，可能人们还不大相信语言能有使人的生理现象转为病理现象的力量。其实这是用不着怀疑的。我们知道，妇女中有一种假妊娠，这种假妊娠就是语言造成的。巴甫洛夫在评论假妊娠时写道：“此时乳腺积极活动起来，腹壁脂肪也开始沉着。你看，人的脑、人的思想、人的语言、人的大脑两半球，对妊娠和脂肪沉着这样纯粹植物神经性机能，竟有这样大的刺激作用。”
    这里，我们找到了分娩疼痛产生的基本原因，明白了分娩疼痛是由人类语言（即教育）造成的疼痛性条件反射所引起的，我们可以用教育的方法解除它。
    引起分娩疼痛的第二个因素是产妇对分娩的恐惧心理。我们知道，对某一种刺激或事情有恐惧心理时，我们的全副精神就集中到那里。这样一来，就提高了大脑对某一种刺激的敏感性。所谓大脑的敏感性增加，就是大脑的某一个中枢的兴奋性活动占着主要地位。产妇在分娩前，就有很多的顾虑，如耽心环境不好；分娩时，她一感觉到子宫收缩，就认为痛苦和危险来临了，把全副精神集中到下腹部，想发现分娩的疼痛，在这种情况下，疼痛是一定要发生的。我们明白了这个道理后，一方面就要产妇主动地消除恐惧心理，另一方面产科医生必须把工作作好，无微不至地体贴她们，在产房中遇到任何情况切不要慌张。这样才能使产妇消除对分娩的恐惧心理。    （全文完）
