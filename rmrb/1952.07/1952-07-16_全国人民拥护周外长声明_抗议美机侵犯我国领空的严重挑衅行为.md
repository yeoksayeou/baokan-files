Xinhua News Agency Report: The serious provocative act of the U.S. Air Force intruding into our country's airspace and killing and wounding peaceful residents has aroused great anger among the people of our country. They unanimously expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of this month's 12th, lodging a serious protest to the U.S. government.

    The people of Beijing and Tianjin expressed extreme indignation at the provocative acts of the American aircraft. Liu Dezhen, National Model Worker and Chairman of the Trade Union of the Shijingshan Capital Power Plant, said: We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. In order to strike at the aggression of American imperialism, our factory increased production and donated a fighter plane last year; this year, our increased production and savings will be equivalent to not just one fighter plane, but ten fighter planes. We have the determination and the confidence to overfulfill this task. Many employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and the Beijing Public Bus Company and Tram Company wrote letters to the newspaper, expressing their intention to respond to the provocative act of the American aggressors bombing Andong by launching a patriotic production increase and economization campaign. Teachers and students from Beijing University, Beijing Normal University, and other schools also wrote letters or published written statements, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. The Tianjin Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and other democratic parties, as well as the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions and other people's organizations, issued joint statements, stating that they would never allow the American aggressors to infringe upon our great motherland in any form.

    The Northeast Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Branch, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Northeast Student Federation, and the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation and other organizations issued a joint statement saying: We, the people of Northeast China, fully support the statement of our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on July 12, and strongly protest against the unreasonable provocation of the American aggressors who slaughtered the peaceful people of our country; in order to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we will continue to contribute all our strength to support the Anti-American and Aid-Korea struggle, and give the aggressors who dare to madly provoke peaceful people an even heavier blow!

    People's organizations in Shenyang City, Liaodong Province, and other places issued statements protesting the massacre of the people of Andong City by American military aircraft. The Liaodong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' statement said: American military aircraft have carried out a large-scale and inhumane bacteriological warfare in our Liaodong Province, bombed the Yalu River Hydropower Station, which is closely related to the peaceful life of our people, and this time invaded the airspace of our Andong City and massacred our peaceful residents. However, this series of provocative actions cannot scare the heroic Chinese people. Our workers in Liaodong Province will take the practical action of overfulfilling the task of increasing production and saving 1.3 million tons of grain to strengthen our national defense and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The people's organizations in East China and Shanghai issued statements separately on the 14th. The Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch called on the people of Shanghai to double their efforts, launch a production increase and economization movement, and continue to strengthen the strength of Anti-American and Aid-Korea, in order to counter the barbaric provocations of the American aggressors. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing one million workers in the city, expressed its firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The statement of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said: "We Shanghai workers have always stood at the forefront of the struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace. We vow to strengthen the Anti-American and Aid-Korea work with practical actions to improve production and all other tasks, smash all provocative actions and conspiracies to expand the war by the American aggressors, and avenge the dead." Democratic parties and people's organizations in Shandong, Nanjing and other provinces and cities unanimously protested the barbaric behavior of the American aggressors.

    The local organizations of various people's organizations and democratic parties in the Central South District, Hunan Province, Wuhan City, Guangzhou City, etc., issued statements one after another, lodging serious protests. The statement of the Central South Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Branch said: "We, the peace-loving people of the Central South District, absolutely cannot tolerate this arrogant, barbaric, and shameless atrocity of the American aggressors. If the American aggressors do not abandon their evil intentions of creating world tension and expanding the war of aggression against Korea as soon as possible, they will inevitably reap the serious consequences of their own actions." The joint statement of the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Democratic Women's Federation, the Central South Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Central South District Democratic Youth Federation, and the Central South District Office of the All-China Students' Federation stated: The workers, youth, women, and students in the entire Central South District will join the people of the whole country in actively participating in the production increase and economization movement, continue to strengthen the strength of Anti-American and Aid-Korea, and fight to the end to defend the motherland, defend the Far East, and lasting world peace.

    Local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Chongqing City issued statements one after another, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest against the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace. The joint statement of the various democratic parties said: We firmly believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, will surely defeat any form of aggression and provocation by American imperialism. The Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, representing the people of the city, issued a warning to the American aggressors, saying: The heroic Chinese people will never be intimidated by any provocation. On the contrary, we will definitely make persistent efforts to strive to the end for the victory of Anti-American and Aid-Korea and defending peace.

    Yang Mingxuan, Chairman of the Northwest Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Branch, issued a written statement saying: On behalf of the more than 30 million patriotic people of all ethnic groups and circles in the entire Northwest, I resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. We will be more inspired to strengthen the strength of Anti-American and Aid-Korea and completely smash the U.S. government's deliberate conspiracy to expand the war of aggression. Zhang Zhizhong also issued a written statement supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. He said: We must warn the American aggressors: any of your conspiracies and tricks are bound to fail under the firm unity of the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people all over the world.
