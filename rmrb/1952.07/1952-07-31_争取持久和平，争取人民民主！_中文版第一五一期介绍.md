The 151st issue of the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

The editorial in this issue is entitled "The Tito Fascist Clique is the Deadly Enemy of Peace, Democracy, and Socialism." Other important articles in this issue include "Strengthening the Ties Between Town and Country in the Current Stage of Socialist Construction" by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "The Great Son of the Bulgarian People and an Outstanding Figure in the International Workers' Movement," an article commemorating Dimitrov by Ganev, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; "The Militarization of Western Austria and the Austrian People's Struggle for Peace" by Koplenig, Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party; and "The Czechoslovak People Take Resolute Action Against Separate War Treaties" by David, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

The editorial states: Four years ago, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties passed the historically significant resolution "Concerning the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia," which provided the most profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the situation in Yugoslavia, exposed the Tito-Ranković clique's treacherous bourgeois nationalist policy to the world, and pointed out that this policy would inevitably lead to Yugoslavia's degeneration into an ordinary bourgeois republic, loss of independence, and transformation into a colony of imperialist countries. Real life has fully confirmed the correctness of these conclusions of the Communist Information Bureau. The Tito fascist bandits have turned Yugoslavia into a military base for American warmongers, who want to use Yugoslav soldiers as cheap cannon fodder and Yugoslav territory as a springboard for war adventurers. The Tito bandits are to play the role of war instigators in the Balkans. The editorial continues: The Tito-Ranković clique, carrying out the tasks assigned by their American masters, organized the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of Rajk, Kostov, Hoxha, and other imperialist spies, but these agents hidden in the people's democratic countries were thoroughly exposed. The conspiracies and tricks carried out by the Belgrade bandits in the ranks of the working class and in the democratic movements of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies have also been resolutely countered. In the struggle between the imperialist and anti-imperialist camps, the Tito fascist clique is the most insane enemy of all advanced and progressive forces. To fight against the fascist Tito clique is the international responsibility of all Communist and Workers' Parties. The Yugoslav working class and laboring peasants are actively launching a struggle to bring their country back into the democratic and socialist camp, and we should do everything possible to support their struggle. This is the unshirkable responsibility of all Communist and Workers' Parties. The editorial concludes: The Yugoslav people are united around the Yugoslav working class. The Yugoslav people's struggle program is based on the historically significant resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties. The Yugoslav working people closely combine the struggle against the hated fascist rule with the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and against the American and British warmongers.

The article by Bierut is his report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. Bierut pointed out: In the current stage of socialist construction in Poland, a very important issue is the relationship between town and country. At present, small-scale individual farming is a widespread phenomenon in agriculture, and the connection between town and country can only be built on the basis of commodity exchange, which is an economy governed by the law of value. The law of value is no longer the dominator of the overall socio-economic relations. It has been strictly limited, but limitation does not mean elimination. Bierut concluded: The main and ultimate goal of our political and economic struggle against capitalist elements in town and country is to eliminate the bourgeoisie and all exploitation of the working people in cities and villages. The only way to achieve this goal is to carry out socialist construction not only in the cities but also in the countryside.

Koplenig's article states: Austria occupies an important position in the war plan of American aggressors to attack socialist countries, and the threat to Austria's security and independence is becoming more serious. Koplenig exposed the situation where Western countries are plundering Austria's strategic raw materials and actively building military facilities in Austria. He also pointed out: Austrian peace fighters are using all possible means to unite the masses to fight for peace. The popular vote held in Salzburg Province against the construction of American barracks achieved a great victory. In Saalfelden, three-quarters of the residents voted against militarization. The bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialists in Korea aroused a wave of anger among the Austrian people. The report meeting of Professor Brandweiner, head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team who visited Korea, attracted many people to participate. The Fifteenth Congress of the Austrian Communist Party, held last November, presented the party with the task of uniting people from all walks of life and all public organizations that truly care about the welfare of the people into a national united front to fight for peace, freedom, and independence. Austrian communists are mobilizing all their forces to successfully carry out this task.

David's article states: The Czechoslovak people resolutely protest against the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty. Our people will not forget the shameful Munich Agreement of 1938. Those who signed separate war treaties with Adenauer are the very guys who should be held responsible for Munich and World War II. The Czechoslovak people fully realize that the threat of war is increasing day by day due to the treaties signed in Bonn and Paris, but they are deeply convinced that the growing strength of the peace camp can thwart the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五一期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五一期已经出版。
    本期社论题为“铁托法西斯集团是和平、民主与社会主义的死敌”。本期其他重要文章有波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特的“加强社会主义建设现阶段中的城乡联系”，保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局候补委员加涅夫的纪念季米特洛夫的文章“保加利亚人民伟大的儿子和国际工人运动的杰出人物”，奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希的“西奥地利的军事化和奥地利人民争取和平的斗争”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记达卫的“捷克斯洛伐克人民采取坚决的行动反对单独的战争条约”等。
    本期的社论说：四年前共产党和工人党情报局通过了有历史意义的“关于南斯拉夫共产党的情势”的决议，对南斯拉夫的局势作了最深刻的马克思—列宁主义的分析，在全世界面前暴露了铁托—兰科维奇集团的卖国的资产阶级民族主义的政策，并指出这一政策必将使南斯拉夫退化为普通的资产阶级共和国，丧失独立，并转变为帝国主义国家的殖民地。现实生活已经完全证实了共产党情报局这些结论的正确性，铁托法西斯匪帮已把南斯拉夫变为美国战争贩子的军事基地，美国想利用南斯拉夫的士兵作廉价的炮灰，利用南斯拉夫国土作为战争冒险者的跳板。铁托匪帮就是要在巴尔干担任战争挑拨者的任务。社论接着说：铁托—兰科维奇集团执行美国主子们指派的任务，组织了拉伊克、柯斯托夫、霍克西以及其他帝国主义间谍分子的反革命阴谋，但是这些潜藏在人民民主国家内的特务都被彻底揭露了。贝尔格莱德匪帮在工人阶级队伍中，在资本主义各国、殖民地和附属国的民主运动中所进行的阴谋诡计也同样遭到了坚决的反击。在帝国主义和反帝国主义两个阵营的斗争中，铁托法西斯集团是一切先进的和进步的力量的最疯狂的敌人。向法西斯铁托集团进行斗争，是一切共产党和工人党的国际责任，南斯拉夫工人阶级和劳动农民正积极地展开战斗，争取他们的国家回到民主和社会主义阵营里来，我们应该尽一切可能支援他们的战斗，这是所有共产党和工人党义不容辞的责任。社论最后说：南斯拉夫人民都团结在南斯拉夫工人阶级的周围，南斯拉夫人民的斗争纲领，正是以共产党和工人党情报局的有历史意义的决议为基础的，南斯拉夫劳动人民把反对人人痛恨的法西斯统治的斗争和各国人民争取和平、反对美英战争贩子的斗争紧密地结合起来。
    本期刊登的贝鲁特的文章是他在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议上的报告。贝鲁特指出：在波兰社会主义建设现阶段中，一个极为重要的问题是城乡联系问题。目前在农业中的小规模的个体耕作是普遍的现象，城乡联系只能建筑在商品交换的基础上，它是受价值法则支配的经济。价值法则现在已不再是总的社会经济关系的支配者，它已受到了严格的限制，不过限制并不等于消灭。贝鲁特最后说：我们反对城乡资本主义成分的政治的经济的斗争的主要的和最后的目的是：消灭资产阶级，消灭城市中和乡村中对劳动人民的一切剥削；要达到这个目的，唯一的道路就是不仅在城市里，同时也在农村中进行社会主义建设。
    柯普勒尼希的文章说：在美国侵略者进攻社会主义国家的战争计划里，奥地利占着重要地位，奥地利的安全和独立所受的威胁更加严重了。柯普勒尼希揭发了西方国家掠夺奥地利的战略原料并积极在奥地利建筑军事设备的情形。他并且指出：奥地利和平战士正用一切可能的方法来团结群众为保卫和平而斗争，在萨尔斯堡省举行的反对美国建筑营房的人民投票，获得了伟大的胜利，在萨尔费登，居民中有四分之三投票反对军国主义化。美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动的细菌战，在奥地利人民中间引起愤怒的浪潮。到过朝鲜的国际民主法协调查团团长布兰德魏纳教授的报告会，吸引了许多人参加。奥地利共产党在去年十一月举行的第十五届代表大会，在党的面前提出了这样一个任务，把各阶层的人民和真正关心人民福利的一切公共团体，都团结到为争取和平、自由、独立而斗争的全国统一战线里来。奥地利共产党人正在动员他们所有力量来胜利地执行这个任务。
    达卫的文章说：捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决抗议“一般性条约”和“欧洲防御集团”条约。我国人民是不会忘记一九三八年的可耻的慕尼黑协定的一年的，那些和阿登纳签订单独战争条约的人们，正是那些要对慕尼黑和第二次世界大战负责的家伙。捷克斯洛伐克人民充分认识，由于在波恩和巴黎所签订的条约，战争的威胁日益增加了，但他们深信和平阵营的日益壮大的力量，能够挫败帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。                    （新华社）
