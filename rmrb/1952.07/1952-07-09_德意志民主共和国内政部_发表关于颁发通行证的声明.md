    German Democratic Republic Ministry of the Interior
    Issues Statement on Issuing Permits
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Berlin, TASS, June 27] The Ministry of the Interior of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on June 25 regarding the issuance of permits to people who do not have national identity cards of the German Democratic Republic. The statement said: Any West German resident who has a residence or place of work in the German Democratic Republic may reside in the Republic with the consent of the Republic's authorities. People who do not have a permanent residence in the German Democratic Republic or the democratic sector of Berlin will have their right to reside in the German Democratic Republic revoked.
    The statement said: These measures are being taken because it is necessary to defend the achievements of the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic, and because it is necessary to prevent the sabotage and subversion activities against the German Democratic Republic that are being prepared within West Berlin.
    The statement concludes: These preliminary measures by the government of the German Democratic Republic will remain in effect until an agreement is reached on holding universal, free elections, which is a prerequisite for the formation of a unified Germany based on democratic principles.

    发表关于颁发通行证的声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林六月二十七日电：德意志民主共和国内政部于六月二十五日为发通行证给没有德意志民主共和国国民身份证的人民一事发表声明。声明说：凡在德意志民主共和国有住所或工作处所的每一个西德居民，在得到共和国当局同意后，可以在共和国境内居留。凡在德意志民主共和国或柏林民主区无常设住所的人们，即取消其在德意志民主共和国居留的权利。
    声明说：所以要采取这些措施，是因为必须保卫德意志民主共和国民主制度的成就，因为必须防止在西柏林境内所准备的对德意志民主共和国的破坏和颠覆活动。
    声明最后说：德意志民主共和国政府的这些初步的措施将继续有效，直到关于举行普遍的、自由的选举一事达成协议为止，这个选举是按照民主原则成立统一的德国的先决条件。
