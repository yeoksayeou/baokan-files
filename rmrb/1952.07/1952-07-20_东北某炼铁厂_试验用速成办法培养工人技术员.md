A Certain Iron and Steel Plant in Northeast China

Experiments with a Crash Course to Train Worker Technicians

    In order to prepare technical talent for future large-scale economic construction, a certain iron and steel plant in Northeast China has been using crash courses to systematically train technical personnel from among the workers, and has achieved initial success. The plant has already trained four worker technicians, and another three workers who have left production and nine on-the-job workers are currently studying. These four worker technicians, after graduating from short-term technical worker schools, and then undergoing three to six months of specialized training, are all able to initially master relatively advanced technical operations and basic theoretical knowledge. Moreover, they are relatively stable in their operations, can learn humbly in their work, and have a high sense of responsibility. For example, Li Feng'en, the first technician trained from among the workers, the blast furnace where he worked had excellent product quality during the 1951 quality inspection campaign. Li Feng'en's shift had the best quality of this blast furnace; there was not a single unqualified batch of iron for three months. Therefore, he was rated as an excellent product quality technician in the plant at the end-of-year model evaluation.

    The plant's experience in using crash courses to train worker technicians is as follows:

    (1) The best candidates for training are furnace-front workers or signalmen with relatively high political consciousness. Because furnace-front workers have close contact with the masses and are familiar with operations outside the furnace, they can connect the outside of the furnace with the inside when it comes to production or handling accidents, and propose reasonable solutions. Signalmen have a higher level of education than furnace-front workers and are in regular contact with various departments involved in blast furnace production. They usually record and observe the overall operational situation of the furnace and are relatively familiar with the internal conditions and the use of various instruments.

    (2) The training procedure and duration: Furnace-front workers first attend a technical school for six months to learn general technical knowledge and improve their cultural and political awareness; then they study signalman work for two to three months; and finally they study technician work for three to six months. Signalmen also first attend a technical school for half a year, then study furnace-front worker work for a period to initially master the technical operations outside the furnace, and finally study technician work for three to four months.

    (3) The workers being trained must foster good teacher-student relationships and mass relationships in order to learn quickly. To this end, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out. For example, signalman Di Shao'an, because of his good relationship with the masses, no one makes sarcastic remarks to him anymore, and many veteran workers are willing to tell him their experiences. Therefore, he was able to take on the work of a technician after only three months of study.

    (4) The teaching methods are divided into two types according to the target audience: For workers with experience in external furnace operations but with a low level of education, the approach is basically from practice to principles, dissolving technical principles into practice, and using language familiar to the workers. For those with less practical experience but a higher level of education (around the second year of junior high school), because they have a stronger ability to accept theory and have self-study reading ability, more theoretical knowledge can be taught, while linking it to practice. After each section is taught, the teacher can assign reference books for them to read.

    (5) Compile unified and correct textbooks to lay a solid theoretical foundation for workers from the beginning. The plant uses Soviet books such as "Modern Blast Furnace Technician," "Blast Furnace Worker's Handbook," and "Striving for Advanced Coefficient" as important reference materials for compiling textbooks.

    The technicians trained from among the workers are relatively weak in general theoretical cultivation and in explaining certain furnace conditions and technical problems that have not occurred. Therefore, a policy of combining crash course training with long-term training must be adopted. That is, after they are on duty as technicians, they still need to be systematically trained, taught theories such as metallurgy, and continue to improve their theoretical level.

    Systematically training a large number of technical personnel with practical experience and theoretical knowledge from among the workers, and rapidly preparing technical forces for large-scale economic construction, has become one of the tasks of various factories and mines. The plant initially estimates that at least 15% of furnace-front workers and a considerable number of signalmen can be trained as technicians. In three to five years, the trained worker technicians, in addition to supplying half of the plant's blast furnace duty technicians, can also supply duty technicians (four-shift system) for at least five newly constructed blast furnaces.

    东北某炼铁厂
    试验用速成办法培养工人技术员
    东北某炼铁厂为了给今后大规模经济建设准备技术人才，用速成办法有计划地从工人中培养技术人员，现已取得初步成绩。该厂已培养出四个工人技术员，另外，还有三个脱离生产的和九个在职的工人正在学习中。这四个工人技术员，他们在短期的技术工人学校毕业后，再经过三个月到六个月的专门培养，就都能够初步掌握相当高级的技术操作和初步理论知识了。而且在操作上比较稳当，在工作中能虚心学习，并有高度的责任心。例如，第一个从工人中培养的技术员李凤恩，在一九五一年质量检查运动中，他所在的高炉是产品质量优良的高炉，这个高炉又以李凤恩的那一班的质量最好，三个月没出一次号外铁。因此，在年底评定模范时，他被评为全厂的产品质量优良的技术员。
    该厂采用速成办法培养工人技术员的经验如下：
    （一）培养对象最好是政治觉悟比较高的炉前工人或信号员。因为炉前工人和群众联系密切，且熟悉炉外操作，不论在生产或处理事故方面，都能从炉外联系到炉内，提出合理的方案。信号员文化程度较炉前工人高，经常与炼铁炉生产的各个部门有接触，平时纪录和察看全炉各种操作情况，比较熟悉炉内状况和各种计器的使用法。
    （二）培养的程序和时间：炉前工人是先上技工学校六个月，学习一般的技术知识，提高文化和政治觉悟；其次学习信号员工作两、三个月；最后学习技术员工作三个月到六个月。信号员也是首先上技工学校学习半年后，再学习一个时期的炉前工人工作，初步掌握炉外操作技术，最后才学习三、四个月的技术员工作。
    （三）被培养的工人，必须搞好师生关系和群众关系，才学习得快，为此就必须开展批评与自我批评。如信号员邸绍安，由于和群众关系良好，再没有人向他说风凉话了，很多老工人也都愿意把自己的经验告诉他。因此，他只学习了三个月，就可以担负技术员的工作了。
    （四）教学方法根据对象分为两种：对于有炉外操作经验，但文化水平很低的工人，基本上是采取由实际到原理，把技术原理溶化在实际当中，用工人熟悉的语言去讲。对那些实际经验较少，但文化程度较高（初中二年级左右）的人，因为他们接受理论能力较强，且有自修阅读能力，便可以多讲些理论知识，同时联系实际，每讲完一节后，老师可以指定参考书给他们阅读。
    （五）编制统一的观点正确的教材，给工人从开始就打下稳固的理论基础。该厂以苏联的“近代高炉技师”、“高炉工手册”、“争取先进系数”等书作为编制教材的重要参考材料。
    从工人中培养出来的技术员，在一般的理论修养方面，在解释某些炉内状况以及某些没有发生过的技术问题方面，还是比较差的，因此，必须采取速成培养和长期培养相结合的方针。就是在他们值班担任技术员后，还需有系统地培养他们，教给他们冶金学等理论，继续提高他们的理论水平。
    有计划地从工人中培养大批有实践经验和理论知识的技术人员，为大规模的经济建设迅速准备技术力量，已成为各厂矿的任务之一。该厂初步估计至少有百分之十五的炉前工人和相当多的信号员可以培养成技术员。三、五年后，培养成的工人技术员，除供给该厂全部炼铁炉值班技术员的一半外，至少还可供给新建设五座高炉的值班技术员（四班制）。（杜印、符自强、邢慧聪）
