How a Factory in Shenyang Promotes Advanced Experiences
    Qi Tinghan
    During the "Three-Anti" movement's "tiger-beating" phase, a factory in Shenyang systematically conducted class education. The workers and masses recognized the essence of the bourgeoisie, drew clear class lines, and greatly improved their level of awareness. Upon entering the discussion of the production increase and conservation plan, a mass movement to "find clever methods" was immediately launched. In less than a month, the factory's employees found 1,428 clever methods. Advanced experiences were discovered and summarized through the method of "publicly recognized clever methods." On this basis, this year's production increase and conservation plan was formulated. Many workers have included the advanced experiences they want to learn in their team and individual plans. The trade union and the enterprise administration signed a collective contract.
    
    Why Advanced Experiences Were Not Promoted
    The plan was relatively advanced, but how to achieve it? The leading cadres of the factory's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League carefully studied the situation, re-studied the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Northeast Trade Union, and the editorial of "Northeast Industry." They unanimously agreed that promoting and learning from advanced experiences was the main method to complete the production increase and conservation plan, and also the basic content of the patriotic production increase competition. The factory leadership decided to seize this central link.

    The leadership universally checked the implementation of the plan for the first week and found that on average, only 63 percent of the teams in the factory completed their team plans. In some workshops, only 52 percent of the teams completed their plans. What was the reason? In addition to a few teams whose plans were not appropriate, the main reason was that advanced experiences were not universally promoted. Taking Zhang Xihe's advanced experience of ensuring quality as an example, everyone verbally acknowledged and raised their hands in agreement, but in reality, only two people in the ninth team of the second workshop were learning. Many people held a skeptical attitude, saying one thing but thinking another, believing that the new methods were not as smooth as the old methods; some workers took a step but gave up when they encountered difficulties; and some veteran workers felt ashamed to learn from others' experiences, sarcastically saying, "When I started my craft, Zhang Xihe wasn't even wearing pants yet!" From this, it can be seen that advanced experiences were not universally valued, and advanced individuals were only recognized by a few. This is the ideological reason why advanced experiences were not promoted. Secondly, advanced experiences were not promoted because of technical reasons. The summary of advanced experiences was not well done, which also hindered its promotion. For example, Zhang Xihe's advanced experience was considered to be diligence in observation, diligence in hands, and diligence in sampling; but his true operational secrets were not summarized from a technical point of view, resulting in simply increasing labor intensity. Many workers operated according to the "three diligences," but they were sweating profusely and still could not reach Zhang Xihe's standards, and slowly became discouraged. Advanced experiences are improvements in production methods and production technology. If workers do not earnestly study and improve their technical level, they will not be able to master advanced experiences. Therefore, the factory leadership decided to first solve the ideological problem of promoting and learning advanced experiences.

    Conducting Ideological Surveys to Understand the Thinking of the Masses
    Promoting advanced experiences is essentially a serious struggle between advanced and conservative backward thinking. To successfully carry out this struggle, it is necessary to grasp the ideological situation and dynamics of the masses.

    In the past, in promoting advanced experiences, the leadership only made general appeals and held demonstrations (which were necessary), but did not focus on solving the ideological problems of the masses. Because the masses were not ideologically mobilized, their enthusiasm for learning advanced experiences was not great, and the effect of promotion was not great. Sometimes, some leading comrades even disregarded the ideological situation of the masses and forcibly promoted advanced experiences, or simply criticized and attacked those workers who refused to learn advanced experiences, causing resentment among the masses and increasing the difficulty of promoting advanced experiences. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the factory conducted a mass ideological survey. The purpose was to find out how the masses recognized advanced experiences, what their interests and concerns were, and how they could accept advanced experiences. Through ideological surveys, their level of awareness and the role of certain old prejudices or old ideas among them were understood from all aspects of the workers' lives. This was a very meticulous task. Qi Hualu, the secretary of the Party branch of the Second Workshop, talked with 83 workers in ten days and also went deep into the workers' dormitory areas to conduct visits.

    The ideological situation of the 109 people surveyed in the Second Workshop can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category included 37 people who had created advanced experiences themselves and had achieved results in learning from others' advanced experiences; the second category included 60 people who sometimes learned and sometimes did not learn, or pretended to learn but did not actually learn (the ninth team had the so-called "five-minute Zhang Xihe," meaning that they learned when the foreman came to check, and after the foreman left, they continued to work in the old way; they were generally active in their work and had their own set of skills); the third category included 12 people who openly resisted advanced experiences and satirized advanced individuals. After the leadership understood the situation, they decided to launch an education campaign. The education policy was to consolidate and improve the existing achievements of the first category of workers in learning advanced experiences, influence and lead the second category of workers, and educate and criticize the third category of workers. Ideological education for the working masses can only be done through enlightenment, guidance, and exemplary demonstration, and simple and crude working methods cannot be used.

    Exemplary Demonstration, Enlightening the Consciousness of the Masses
    The Party Committee studied various ideological situations, re-propagated the significance of advanced experiences in improving labor productivity and the country's industrialization and socialist future, and explained that creating and learning advanced experiences was a concrete manifestation of the working masses' love for the motherland. It was decided to cultivate role models according to different ideological types, and then have the role models make demonstration reports to enlighten the masses' ideological consciousness.

    The exemplary deeds of advanced producers must be correctly summarized from both technical and ideological aspects. In the past, Zhang Xihe's advanced experience of ensuring quality was summarized as the "three diligences," which could not be promoted. After reviewing this shortcoming, the factory administration sent two technicians to conduct a re-summarization. The two technicians analyzed his actions from a technical point of view and summarized them as five characteristics such as "grabbing more," "fewer re-workings," and "diligence in sampling." Everyone realized that Zhang Xihe's operating methods did have new improvements, and immediately increased their interest in learning. At the same time, the Party branch decided to summarize Zhang Xihe's advanced thinking in creating advanced experiences. They conducted a detailed study of Zhang Xihe's ideological development process, the motives for creating advanced experiences, and the ideological roots that enabled him to create advanced experiences, and helped him make a systematic ideological summary. Zhang Xihe had introduced his advanced experiences in the past, but the effect was not great. After such help, this son of a Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army martyr made another report to the masses, talking about his thoughts and motivations from a technical point of view. His report moved many workers, and some workers went on stage to shake hands with him. The workshop trade union seized the opportunity and immediately organized group discussions. The masses universally praised his skills and his high sense of ownership. The model report by veteran worker Cao Jiqing explained why he had not produced a single defective product out of tens of thousands of products, and also talked about the contrast between the old and new societies. He said, "Now I have no other worries besides work." Veteran worker Liu Xueshan was moved to tears on the spot. He thought that he complained about his low wages and had "forgotten the pain once the wound healed," and was letting down Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Young workers said: "If Master Cao, who is over fifty years old, can fight for the socialist future, we young people should work even harder." After these model reports, nearly half of the second category of workers changed their attitude towards advanced experiences and advanced individuals.

    Next, the leadership cultivated models of ideological transformation from the second and third categories of workers, continued to clear their minds, praised their achievements after the transformation, and helped them introduce the process of transformation. Generally speaking, the ideological situation of the second and third categories of people is more complicated. It is necessary to select models of various ideologies in order to solve the complex ideological problems of the masses through their demonstration reports. When cultivating such models, special attention should be paid to encouraging their transformation, while not neglecting their achievements and their own secrets. After being praised, they began to thank advanced individuals. The transformation of these people can promote the progress of the second category of people.

    For the third category of models who have not yet transformed, specific analysis must be done, and sometimes the Party branch secretary and the trade union chairman need to provide individual assistance. Veteran worker Hu Changhuai in the First Workshop opposed the promotion of advanced experiences. He believed that teaching apprentices would starve the master, and he planned to save money to buy land to retire. The leadership had several conversations with him, enlightening his awareness from his many years of experience and the status and future of the working class in the new society. Finally, he reviewed his erroneous thinking. Xue Rongjiu, an old worker who had not taught his apprentices how to use a knife for two and a half years, said: "Master Hu has reviewed his errors, so I'll talk too! I also have this kind of thinking, so I don't want to teach apprentices." The apprentice also reviewed his thinking of looking down on the master. After the master reviewed his errors, he guaranteed to teach his apprentice how to use a knife within a month. For this kind of model, as long as they are properly selected and successfully cultivated, their reports are often very vivid, very profound, and very educational. The trade union must also use various lively forms to carry out propaganda and mobilization work to expand the effect of education.

    Through exemplary demonstrations, the masses' awareness was greatly improved, and they generally began to consciously review their attitude towards learning advanced experiences and consider their own ideological problems.

    Conduct Self-Criticism and Review Plans for Learning Advanced Experiences
    At the same time as cultivating models, ideological criticism was carried out among Party members, League members, and leading cadres. Party members and League members focused on checking whether they actively took the lead in learning advanced experiences and helping others learn. Party member Lin Fanqi consulted with the masses on the secrets he came up with and helped non-Party comrades come up with ideas to improve production methods, and was praised by the Party Committee. Party member Zhang Guangsheng (production team leader) said to the young workers: "I can't even teach you how to do it by hand, so what kind of technical learning are we organizing? If it were in the past, I would have slapped you in the face." Ideological struggle was launched against these erroneous ideas. Through ideological criticism, Party members and League members clearly established the idea of taking the lead in learning and promoting advanced experiences. For non-Party member production team leaders, training courses were adopted to help them dig out erroneous ideas.

    After "ideological comparison," the masses also consciously began to conduct self-criticism. Because the development of self-criticism went through a process of first inside the Party and then outside the Party, first cadres and then the masses. Therefore, the leadership's thinking was clear, and there were Party members and League members as the backbone, the development of work was smooth, and the ideological education work in the construction stage of the "Three-Anti" movement was greatly enriched.

    Self-criticism must be conscious and voluntary. After model reports and repeated enlightenment, the leadership made preliminary summaries of the problems exposed and guided the masses to analyze various ideas until they clarified the class essence of these ideas and found the root cause of erroneous ideas. After the "Three-Anti" movement, and after nearly a month of class education, the masses had mastered the weapon of self-criticism, and were particularly vigilant against bourgeois ideas, which were all very favorable conditions.

    After self-criticism, the masses' class consciousness was greatly improved, advanced ideas occupied an absolute advantage, and conservative and complacent ideas were severely hit. The masses universally valued advanced experiences and developed sincere respect for advanced individuals, which truly laid an ideological and mass foundation for the promotion of advanced experiences. At this time, the original 109 people were surveyed again. There were already 91 people in the first category, 15 people in the second category (most of whom were promoted from the third category), and only 3 people in the third category. The advanced forces were unprecedentedly strong, and a few more stubborn workers were completely isolated. The masses began to express indignation at their backwardness and demanded further investigation into the essence of their thoughts. At this time, the leading cadres took the initiative to talk to them individually and provide further specific assistance. Some workers were ashamed and embarrassed to see anyone as soon as they saw the person in charge talking to them, saying that they had no face to see people. The leadership should continue to sincerely educate them and encourage them to progress. An atmosphere of welcoming anyone's progress should also be created among the masses.

    This ideological criticism more deeply exposed the backward ideas of some employees. Such as: fear of affecting wage income, fear of changing jobs, personal plans that do not care about production, and even some thinking of leaving the factory to change careers or going home to farm. These ideas are obstacles to the promotion of advanced experiences. After this ideological education, the masses universally realized that these erroneous ideas were reflections of the exploitative class ideas among the workers, which were very harmful to the working class and the cause of the people. Therefore, workers with this problem are willing to correct their mistakes and strive to learn from advanced producers after this education.

    After ideological criticism, individual plans for learning advanced experiences were revised. These plans already have a more solid ideological foundation.

    Strengthen Technical Learning and Master Advanced Experiences
    After the workers revised their individual plans for learning advanced experiences, they consolidated the ideological achievements through methods such as "Patriotic Pledges" and "Personal Accumulation Manuals." On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the technical learning of the workers. Otherwise, even if there is a desire to learn advanced experiences, it is still impossible to promote advanced experiences if the technology is not improved. Therefore, with the assistance of the working masses, the technical personnel comprehensively summarized various advanced experiences, distinguishing between the important and the urgent. Then, use it as teaching material, with technical personnel explaining to the workers, and advanced producers actually demonstrating, passing on, until the workers basically master the advanced experience, and then revise the old operating procedures with reference to these advanced experiences. This new procedure is a guarantee for the comprehensive completion of the production increase and conservation plan. Because the masses consciously carried out ideological criticism and dug out the erroneous ideas that they were unwilling to learn advanced experiences. A climax of learning advanced experiences appeared in the whole factory, greatly shortening the originally planned time for learning advanced experiences. For example, the ninth team originally planned to learn Zhang Xihe's advanced experience by the end of July, but by June 19, 12 people had learned it, and it is expected that all of them can learn it by the end of June. That is, one month ahead of schedule. This also proves that after solving the ideological problem, the speed of promoting advanced experiences and learning technology is accelerated. Now more than 90% of the teams in the factory have completed their team's production increase and conservation plans. The production increase and conservation plan for the whole factory exceeded 23.9% in May, and it may exceed this proportion in June.

    × × ×
    The experience of a certain factory shows that the process of promoting advanced experience is first of all a struggle between advanced ideas and conservative ideas. Therefore, the relevant organizations of the enterprise should actively lead this struggle, vigorously support and mobilize the masses to support progressive ideas, and criticize those conservative ideas. This is also a very practical and very profound mass self-education. After this education, the masses further recognized the relationship between individuals and the country, the significance of improving production methods, and the role of advanced individuals. As a result, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were further improved, and the workers' enthusiasm for studying technology was further encouraged.

    The experience of a certain factory also shows that the process of promoting advanced experience is also the process of workers learning technology and improving their technical level. Without the improvement of technical level, the working masses cannot truly master advanced experiences or advanced production methods. The advanced experience in the enterprise is promoted from the constant ideological struggle and technical learning.

    沈阳某工厂怎样推广先进经验
    齐廷汉
    沈阳市某工厂在“三反”运动的打“虎”阶段，进行了比较系统的阶级教育。职工群众认清了资产阶级的本质，划清了阶级界限，觉悟程度大大提高了。进入讨论增产节约计划时，立即开展了群众性的找窍门运动，不到一个月的时间，全厂职工找出窍门一千四百二十八个。又通过“公认窍门”的办法发现和总结了先进经验。在这基础上，制订了今年的增产节约计划。许多工友都把自己要学习的先进经验订入小组的和个人的计划中。工会和企业行政方面签订了集体合同。
    为什么没有推广先进经验
    计划是比较先进的，但，怎样实现呢？工厂的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部细致地研究了情况，重新学习了中共中央东北局的指示、东北工会第二届代表大会的决议和“东北工业”的社论。一致认为推广和学习先进经验是完成增产节约计划的主要方法，也是爱国增产竞赛的基本内容，工厂的领导方面决定抓住这个中心环节。
    领导方面普遍检查了第一周计划执行的情况，发现全厂平均只有百分之六十三的小组完成了小组的计划，有的车间只有百分之五十二小组完成了自己的计划。原因在那里呢？除少数小组因计划订的不恰当外，主要原因是先进经验没有普遍推广。以张喜贺保证质量的先进经验为例，大家是口头承认，举手赞成的，但实际上二车间第九道小组只有两人学习。不少人口服心不服地抱着怀疑态度，认为新办法不如老办法顺手；有的工人试着迈步，碰到困难就不学了；还有的老师傅觉得学别人的经验丢人，讥讽地说：“我开始耍手艺的时候，张喜贺还没穿裤子呢！”由此可见先进经验还没被普遍重视，先进人物还只被少数人承认。这是先进经验没有推广的思想上的原因。其次先进经验没有被推广，还有技术上的原因。先进经验的总结做得不好，也障碍了它的推广。如把张喜贺的先进经验认为是眼勤、手勤、抽验勤；而没有从技术原则上总结出他操作上的真正窍门，结果成了单纯提高劳动强度。不少工人按着三勤操作，累的满头大汗还是达不到张喜贺的标准，慢慢也就灰心了。先进经验是生产方法、生产技术的改进，如果工人不认真地学习并提高技术水平，也是掌握不了先进经验的。因此，工厂领导方面决定，首先解决推广和学习先进经验的思想问题。
    进行思想调查，了解群众思想情况
    推广先进经验，原是先进思想和保守落后思想的严重斗争。要想胜利地进行这一斗争，就必须掌握群众的思想情况和思想动态。
    过去推广先进经验，领导方面只做了一般的号召和举行了表演（这是需要的），没有着重去解决群众的思想问题。因为群众没有从思想上发动起来，学习先进经验的劲头不大，推广的效果也是不大的。有时某些领导同志甚至不顾群众的思想情况，硬去推广先进经验，或单纯批评、打击那些拒绝学习先进经验的工人，引起群众的反感，增加了推广先进经验的困难。因此，在党委领导下，全厂进行了群众的思想调查。目的是弄清群众怎样认识先进经验，他们的兴趣和顾虑是什么，怎样才能接受先进经验。并通过思想调查从工人生活的各方面了解他们的觉悟程度以及某些旧成见或旧思想在他们中间的作用。这是一个十分细致的工作，二车间党支部书记齐华鲁在十天中就和八十三个工人谈了话，还深入到工人宿舍区作了访问。
    二车间调查的一百零九人的思想情况，大体可分为三类。第一类，自己创造过先进经验，并学习别人先进经验有成绩的，有三十七人；第二类，时学时不学或明学暗不学的（九道有所谓“五分钟的张喜贺”，即工长来检查时便学，工长走后照老法子干，他们工作一般也积极，技术上有自己一套），有六十人；第三类，公开抵抗先进经验，讽刺先进人物的有十二人。领导方面摸清了情况，即决定展开教育工作。教育的方针是巩固、提高第一类工人学习先进经验的现有成绩，影响和带起第二类工人，教育和批判第三类工人。对工人群众的思想教育，只能是启发、诱导、典型示范，而不能采用简单化的和粗暴的工作方式。
    典型示范，启发群众的自觉
    党委研究了各种思想情况，重新宣传了先进经验对提高劳动生产率，对国家工业化和社会主义前途的意义，说明创造和学习先进经验是工人群众热爱祖国的具体表现。并决定按思想类型分别培养典型，然后，由典型人物做示范报告，启发群众的思想觉悟。
    必须把先进生产者的典型事迹，从技术和思想两方面，加以正确的总结。过去把张喜贺保证质量的先进经验，总结成三勤，结果无法推广。检讨出这一缺点后，工厂行政方面派出两个技术员重新进行总结。两位技术员从技术原则方面分析了他的动作，总结为“抓得多”，“倒货少”“抽验勤”等五个特点。大家才认识到张喜贺的操作方法的确有新的改进，马上提高了学习兴趣。与此同时，党支部决定总结张喜贺创造先进经验的先进思想。详细研究了张喜贺的思想发展过程，创造先进经验的动机，找出他所以能创造先进经验的思想根源，帮助他做出了系统的思想总结。张喜贺过去曾介绍过自己的先进经验，但效果不大。经过这样的帮助以后，这个东北抗日联军烈士的儿子，又重新向群众作了报告，从技术说到自己的思想和动机。他的报告感动了很多工人，有些工人上台去和他握手，车间工会趁热打铁，立即组织了小组讨论。群众普遍称赞他的技术和他高度的主人翁自觉。老工人曹吉庆的典型报告，说出了他为什么在成千上万个产品中没出一个废品的道理，又说到新旧社会的对比。他说：“现在我除了工作，再也没有牵挂了。”老工人刘学山感动得当场哭了，他想到自己嫌工资少，是“好了疮疤忘了痛”，对不起毛主席和共产党。青年工人说：五十多岁的曹师傅都能为社会主义前途奋斗，我们青年人更应该加劲干了。经过这些典型报告后，第二类的工人将近一半改变了对先进经验和先进人物的态度。
    接着，领导方面又从第二、三类工人中培养思想转变的典型，继续打通思想，表扬他们转变后的成绩，帮助他们介绍转变的经过。一般说，第二、三类人物的思想情况比较复杂。要选出各种思想的典型，才便于经过他们的示范报告解决群众那些复杂的思想问题。培养这类典型时，应特别注意鼓励他们的转变，同时还不要忽视他们的成绩和他们自己的窍门。他们受到表扬后，开始感谢先进人物。这些人的转变可以推动第二类人的进步。
    对于还没有转变的第三类典型，必须做具体分析，有时需要党支部书记和工会主席去个别帮助。一车间老工人呼长怀反对推广先进经验，他认为教会徒弟就饿死师傅，天天盘算积钱买地养老。领导方面对他作了多次谈话，从他多年的经历和新社会中工人阶级的地位和前途，启发了他的觉悟，最后他检讨了自己的错误思想。二年半不教徒弟上刀的老工人薛容九说：呼师傅都检讨了，我也说吧！我也是这种思想，所以不愿教徒弟。徒弟也检讨了瞧不起师傅的思想。师傅检讨后，保证一个月内教会徒弟上刀。对于这类典型，只要选择得适当，培养得成功，他们的报告往往是很生动，很深刻，教育意义是很大的。工会必须同时运用各种生动活泼的形式展开宣传鼓动工作，以扩大教育的效果。
    经过典型示范，群众的觉悟大大提高，普遍开始自觉地检讨自己学习先进经验的态度，考虑自己的思想问题。
    开展自我批评，审订学习先进经验计划
    和培养典型的同时，即在党员团员及领导骨干中进行思想批判。党员团员着重检查自己是否积极带头学习先进经验和帮助别人学习。党员林繁琪自己想出窍门就和群众商量，帮助非党同志出主意改进生产方法，受到党委的表扬。党员张广生（生产组长）对青年工人说：“我把着手教你们都不会，还组织什么技术学习？要是从前，早就打你们的耳光了。”对这样一些错误思想，大家展开了思想斗争。经过思想批判，党员团员中明确树立了带头学习和推广先进经验的思想。对于非党员的生产组长，采取训练班的形式来帮助他们挖错误思想。
    群众经过“思想对照”，也自觉地开始进行自我批评。因为自我批评的展开是经过了先党内、后党外，先干部、后群众的过程。所以，领导思想明确，又有党员团员为骨干，工作的发展是顺利的，并大大充实了“三反”建设阶段的思想教育工作。
    自我批评必须是自觉自愿的。经过典型报告和反复启发，领导方面把暴露出来的问题加以初步总结，引导群众去分析各种思想，直到弄清这些思想的阶级本质，找出错误思想的总根子。“三反”运动后，又经过将近一个月的阶级教育，群众业已掌握了自我批评的武器，特别对资产阶级的思想警惕性很高，这都是很有利的条件。
    经过自我批评以后，群众的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，先进思想已经占了绝对优势，保守、自满思想受到严重打击。群众普遍重视了先进经验，对先进人物产生了由衷的尊敬，这给推广先进经验真正奠立了思想基础和群众基础。这时，又调查了原来的那一百零九人，第一类的工人，已有九十一人，第二类工人十五人（大部由第三类上升的），第三类只有三人了。先进力量空前壮大，比较固执的几个工人完全孤立了。群众开始对他们的落后表示愤慨，要求进一步追究他们的思想实质。这时领导干部即主动找他们作个别谈话，再进行具体帮助。有的工人一看见负责人找他谈话，就羞愧交加，说自己没脸见人，领导方面仍要继续诚恳地教育他，鼓励他进步。在群众中也要造成欢迎任何人进步的空气。
    这次思想批判比较深刻地暴露了若干职工中的落后思想。如：怕影响工资收入、怕调换工作岗位，不管生产好坏的个人打算，甚至有的想退厂转业或回家种地等思想。这些思想都是推广先进经验的障碍。经过这一次思想教育，群众普遍认识了这些错误思想都是剥削阶级思想在工人中的反映，对工人阶级和人民的事业危害很大。因此，凡有这种毛病的工人，经过这次教育，都愿改正错误，努力向先进生产者看齐。
    在思想批判之后，都重新审订了个人学习先进经验的计划。这些计划已有了比较巩固的思想基础。
    加强技术学习掌握先进经验
    工人修订了个人学习先进经验的计划以后，再通过“爱国公约”“个人积累手册”等方式巩固思想上的成果。另一方面必须加强工人群众的技术学习。否则，只有学习先进经验的愿望，而技术不提高还是不能推广先进经验的。因此，技术人员在工人群众的协助下，把各种先进经验，分别轻重缓急，加以综合和总结。然后把它用作教材，由技术人员向工人讲解，由先进生产者实际表演，传授，直到工人基本掌握了先进经验，再参照这些先进经验修改旧的操作规程。这种新的规程，便是全面完成增产节约计划的保证。由于群众自觉地进行了思想批判，挖出了不愿学习先进经验的错误思想。全厂出现了学习先进经验的高潮，大大缩短了原计划学习先进经验的时间。如九道小组原计划七月底学会张喜贺的先进经验，到六月十九日已有十二人学会，预计六月底可全部学会。即提前一个月的时间。由此也证明了：在解决了思想问题之后，推广先进经验和学习技术的速度是加快了。现在全厂已有百分之九十以上的小组完成了小组的增产节约计划。全厂的增产节约计划五月份超过百分之二十三点九，六月份还可超过这个比例。
    ×    ×    ×
    某工厂的经验说明：推广先进经验的过程首先是一个先进思想和保守思想的斗争过程。因此，企业的有关组织就要积极领导这个斗争，大力支持并发动群众拥护进步的思想，批判那些保守思想。这又是一个很实际很深刻的群众自我教育。经过这次教育，群众进一步认识了个人和国家的关系，认识了改进生产方法的意义和先进人物的作用。因而更加提高了群众的积极性和创造性，更鼓舞了工人群众对技术的钻研热情。
    某工厂的经验也说明了：推广先进经验的过程，也是职工群众学习技术和提高技术水平的过程。没有技术水平的提高，工人群众就不能真正掌握先进经验或先进的生产方法。企业中的先进经验，就是从经常不断的思想斗争和技术学习中得到推广的。
