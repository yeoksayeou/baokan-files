    All Representatives of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Hero Model Representative Conference
    Request Chairman Mao to Assign More Arduous Construction Tasks
    Respected Chairman Mao: We responded to your great call and participated in the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Our 300,000-strong labor army, with the full support of the people of the whole country, especially the people of Hubei and Hunan, completed the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in two and a half months from April 5th to June 20th. From then on, the Jingjiang flood that threatened Hubei and Hunan has been brought under control, and the millions of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River can build their happy lives with peace of mind. Therefore, after hearing the news of the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the people of Hubei and Hunan cheered your name with unparalleled enthusiasm and wished you good health forever.

    Respected Chairman Mao: We encountered many difficulties in our work. However, the hardworking and brave Chinese people, educated by you, are capable of overcoming any difficulties. When we didn't have enough shovels, we used our hands to dig soil; when we didn't have enough carrying tools, we used our clothes to carry silt; when we didn't understand technology, we studied hard and carefully; when time was tight, we "raced against time" and worked day and night; when there was a lot of rain, we "didn't stop working for light rain and didn't leave the construction site for heavy rain." In this way, we prepared, worked, studied, planned, and revised, using a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism to overcome all kinds of difficulties. This is the result of your education and leadership. Therefore, the greatest glory should go to you—our respected leader.

    Chairman Mao, we earnestly hope that you will give us more arduous construction tasks. We guarantee that we will not be arrogant or impatient, that we will summarize and apply the experience of this work well, and that we will give even greater play to our initiative and creativity, so as to strive for greater victories in the great construction of the motherland.

    Eight hundred representatives of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Hero Model Representative Conference

    荆江分洪工程英雄模范代表大会全体代表
    要求毛主席给予更加艰巨的建设任务
    敬爱的毛主席：我们响应了您的伟大号召，参加修建荆江分洪工程。我们三十万劳动大军，在全国人民，特别是两湖人民的全力支援下，在四月五日到六月二十日两个半月内，完成了荆江分洪工程。从此，危害两湖的荆江洪水已被控制住了，荆江两岸千百万人民可以安心建设自己的幸福生活了。因此，两湖人民听到荆江分洪工程胜利完工的消息后，以无比的热情，欢呼着您的名字，祝您永远健康。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在工作中曾经遇到很多困难。但是，您教养下的勤劳勇敢的中国人民，是能够克服任何困难的。洋锹不够，我们用双手挖土；挑具不够，我们用衣服装淤泥；不懂技术，我们就勤学苦练、细心钻研；时间紧促，我们就“和时间赛跑”，日夜加紧工作；雨水多，我们就“小雨不误工作，大雨不离工地”。就这样，我们一面准备、一面工作、一面学习、一面计划、一面修正，用高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，战胜了各种各样的困难。这是您教育、领导我们的结果。因此，最大的光荣应该归于您——我们敬爱的领袖。
    毛主席，我们恳切地希望您交给我们更艰巨的建设任务。我们保证不骄不躁，很好地总结和运用这次工作的经验，更高地发挥积极性和创造性，在祖国伟大建设中争取更大的胜利。
    荆江分洪英雄模范代表大会全体代表八百人
