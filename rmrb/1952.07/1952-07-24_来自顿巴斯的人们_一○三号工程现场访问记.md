    People from Donbass
    ——A Visit to the Construction Site of Project 103
    By Northeast Daily Reporter Wu Shaoqi
    The Soviet experts here are people from Donbass. Our bookstores once sold a book called "The Revival of Donbass," which chronicled the epic story of the Soviet people's efforts to revive their national industry. During the war years, we read this book and were inspired by their selfless labor and love for their country. We imagined the future of our own country and thought that we too should have a "Donbass." Now, our wish has come true. We are building factories and opening coal mines everywhere on our own land. At this moment, a group of Soviet people from Donbass—sent by Marshal Stalin—are helping us as they built their own Donbass.

    An electrical expert told me: "Every Soviet citizen is very concerned about China, especially after the founding of the New China, even more concerned about every achievement. When I accepted the task of coming to this emerging country, this brotherly country, to help with industrial construction, I really didn't have the right words to express my feelings. The word 'excitement' falls far short of its intensity. ... I thought: this is like building my own country, I must complete this glorious task with utmost loyalty!"

    Our international friends have come to China with such a great aspiration. Each of them is working with such sincere friendship and internationalist spirit. In concept, you know that they are Soviet experts, here to help us with construction. In reality, you cannot see any difference between "helping others" and "doing it for themselves" from them. All their emotions are integrated with their work. Even back in Moscow, an expert had already begun planning materials for us. He saw that our order form was missing many necessary precision instruments—which are also a rarity in the Soviet Union—and immediately suggested adding them. When the project first started, it was chaotic here, with materials ordered from the Soviet Union scattered everywhere and poorly managed. As soon as the experts got off the train, they began to work as our material clerks. The leader of the expert team—a 49-year-old man—personally held the material ledger and checked it against the boxes, classifying and organizing them for us. Another expert was sick at the time, running a high fever, but he joined the crane operators and personally participated in the sorting of each box. Those who had gone home to rest had already come to work, but the experts were still busy there. Once, an expert fell ill and the doctor told him to rest for seven days, but he came to work the next day. He broke out in cold sweat after walking a few steps and had to sit down to rest for a while, but he still insisted on working—in order not to affect the progress of the project. A few days ago, an expert had severe bronchial pain. He pressed his chest with one hand while busy with work. Everyone persuaded him to get treatment, but he said, "The work is too busy, I can't leave!" They persuaded him three times in a row, but he still wouldn't listen. Later, everyone insisted on bringing the car to take him to the hospital again, but he still wouldn't leave, saying, "Let's go on Monday, I can't let my illness affect the work!" Every expert showed such enthusiasm in their work, planning every matter for us wholeheartedly, even a small matter, a detail in the work. For the shims on the machine base, the expert personally went to a local machinery factory to negotiate and ask for assistance. But that machinery factory had never made such parts, and the workers were afraid to start. He then started doing political work, telling the workers the importance of this part to the entire installation project, telling the workers not to hesitate: "Everything is created by people! I will teach you how to do it!" So, every day after finishing the work on the construction site, he ran to this machinery factory to teach the workers the technique. After each shim was made, he also personally ground it. When the cable laying project on the electrical construction site began, the expert's hands were always covered with asphalt. Every day after arranging the work, he started working himself, carefully studying what style each turn of the cable should be made into to look good. If the project was short of any small items, he would pay attention to finding them on his way to work, picking up small screws and iron pieces on the ground.

    They are not only working selflessly, but also enthusiastically passing on new technologies to us at all times. They eagerly hope that we can quickly master new technologies and use new technologies to independently build our own country. One expert said: "The task is not completed until cadres are trained after the installation is finished!" At his initiative, a welding training class was organized here. He sacrificed his lunch break time every day to write lecture notes for the training class and give lessons to the workers. He spent a lot of energy on this training class. He knew that in order to teach well, he had to first make the translation comrades understand some basic principles. So he asked the translation comrades to study physics and chemistry from scratch, and also took them to watch others operate, explaining the process of metal welding while watching. After that, he borrowed an electric welding machine and welded it himself, welding one and explaining it again, explaining how the welding method was wrong, and explaining the difference between several welding methods. After the explanation, he asked the translation comrades to weld, holding their hands to teach them, until the basic principles were taught clearly, then he stopped and said: "You understand some, it will be convenient for me to lecture in the future!" Our electric welding and flame welding technology level is not high. Soviet experts are always welding these important parts for us on site where steel frames and steel pipes have high pressure. Everyone taught an apprentice. Liang Fu, who learned the advanced flame welding method from the expert, told me: "When I first started working, the expert welded himself and asked me to watch by the side. After a few days, he asked me to try. When I tried, it didn't work, and the molten iron flowed all over the ground. The expert held my hands and taught me. This was how he taught me for many days in a row. Sometimes we climbed on the ground to weld together. He would say 'good' when I made a little progress. He would tell me whenever I asked, never impatient! He always said to me: 'Study hard, it will be your responsibility when I leave!'" In a few months, Liang Fu was already able to weld some secondary parts. At the end of June, he also went to Shenyang to participate in the advanced experience promotion conference of the Bureau and introduced this new method to the workers of various basic construction departments in the Northeast. When installing the first boiler, all the important parts had to be welded by experts, but when installing the second boiler, worker Zhang Hongsheng had already learned the new electric welding method and replaced the expert's work. Zhang Hongsheng told me: "At that time, the expert took me everywhere on the frame whenever he had time, telling me what to pay attention to when welding, and also found books for me to read, but unfortunately I couldn't understand them! ... Today (June 23), he climbed onto the frame again and asked me if I was tired? He also planned to help me weld a section!" Every expert is like this, eager to teach us all their advanced methods at once. As soon as an expert sees a site technician working with old methods, he immediately teaches a new method, and then instructs: "You must teach this method to the workers, I will examine them, you will be responsible if they don't know it!" Experts often tell our cadres: "You must use us well, so that you can work independently when we return home!"

    Human life is the most precious. Soviet experts always teach our cadres to pay attention to technical safety. Whenever they have the opportunity, they say: "The first is people, and the second is machines; if the machine is broken, it can be bought, but people cannot be resurrected if they die!" At the construction site where the expert is located, if the factory building is not cleaned, if there are no lighting equipment at night, if there are no railings on the platform, and if the safety belt is not fastened when working at heights, he will not allow construction. Once, he saw the crane operator standing on top while lifting the cylinder, and he shouted to stop it: "This is not allowed! This is against the law in the Soviet Union!" He often said: "Leading cadres will make mistakes if they don't pay attention to safety!" At the boiler construction site, sometimes several wire ropes of the winch are put together, and the scaffolders want to climb up to untie them. The expert saw it and criticized severely: "We must discard the old method, it is so dangerous! We must study new methods, people can untie it without climbing up!" They are not only very concerned about technical safety, but also equally concerned about the health of the workers. An expert insisted on working with severe rheumatism, but he did not allow the workers to do so. A worker's eyes were injured by electric welding sparks and he was still adjusting a part. He stopped him and said: "I would rather not adjust it today, you should go back to rest. Put some eye drops at the clinic, wrap it with a towel and sleep for a day, it will definitely get better!"

    Like protecting the property of their own country, they cherish the equipment on the construction site—even a small piece of iron plate or a screw. An expert calls the pile of old materials in the yard "Gold Mountain," saying: "If you don't pay attention to it, it is like throwing gold on the road!" During installation, if there is a shortage of materials, he will take the technician to the old material pile to find it. He knows clearly what is on each pile. Comrade Liang Senguo personally went to the old material pile to mark the usable materials with chalk in order to help the repair site save materials. An expert came up with a plan to use waste materials when designing a tubular crane, but after ten minutes, he said again: "That method will cost more iron plate, I have another method." He drew a sketch on the spot and asked the translation comrades to send it. Once, after work, the expert saw that a machine was not covered, so he found a newspaper to cover it and told the security personnel to watch it carefully. He said: "Whether a person cherishes the machine can show whether he loves his country!" This is the concrete manifestation of the communist morality of the Soviet people. A translation comrade said well: "The experts' eyes are always busy when they walk! If they see something exposed outside, they will cover it up!"

    They have devoted all their energy for China's industrialization and for the happiness of the Chinese people. They have enabled us to quickly learn the world's most advanced technology and advanced management methods; so that we can avoid many detours on the road to industrialization. At the end of June, this construction team was commended by the Bureau for adopting the advanced methods of the Soviet Union. This is the result of the help of Soviet experts, and this honor should be attributed to those who enthusiastically help us. They have done so much, but they themselves still feel that they have not done anything! When I went to interview an expert, he said: "Chinese workers should be praised, we have nothing!" He also said: "Due to language difficulties, we have not done enough!"

    What friendship in the world is more noble than this? Who can find such a precedent in history? Such friendship can only exist in the era of the victory of the proletarian revolution. We should be inspired and cheer for this: Thank you Stalin!

    来自顿巴斯的人们
    ——一○三号工程现场访问记
    东北日报记者  吴少琦
    这里的苏联专家是来自顿巴斯的人们。我们的书店里曾经卖过一本叫作“复兴顿巴斯”的书，那里记述的是苏维埃人复兴祖国工业的史诗。在战争的年代里，我们读了这本书，曾为他们那热爱祖国的忘我的劳动而感奋，曾由此联想过我们祖国的未来，想到我们也要有“顿巴斯”。现在，我们的愿望实现了，我们在自己的土地上到处盖工厂、开煤田，而就在这时候，又从顿巴斯来了一群苏维埃人——斯大林大元帅派来的人，像建设他们的顿巴斯一样地在帮助我们。
    电气专家告诉我：“每一个苏联公民都非常关心中国。特别是新中国成立以后，更关心她的每一个成就。当我接受了任务，要到这个新兴的国家、兄弟的国家来帮助工业建设，那时候的心情实在没有恰当的语汇来表达，‘兴奋’两个字是远不能表现出它的程度的。……我想到：这是和给自己祖国建设一样，一定要忠心耿耿地完成这个光荣任务！”
    我们的国际友人，就是抱着这样一个伟大的意愿来到中国的。他们每一个人，都是以这样的真挚的友谊，这样的国际主义精神在劳动着。在概念上，你知道他们是苏联专家，是来帮助我们建设的，实际上，你从他们身上看不出“帮助别人”和“给自己做”究竟有什么区别，他们的全部感情都和工作溶合在一起了。还是在莫斯科的时候，一位专家就已经开始为我们计划起材料来，他看见我们的订货单上缺少很多必需的精密仪表——在苏联也是一种很稀罕的东西——当时就提议给添上了。工程刚开始的时候，这里是杂乱无章的，从苏联订购来的器材到处乱放，管理得很不好。专家们一下火车，首先就替我们做起材料员的工作来。专家组长——一个四十九岁的老头——亲自拿着材料账，一箱一箱地对照着，给我们归类、整理。另一位专家当时正在病中，发着高烧，但竟和起重工们在一起，每一箱都亲自参加整理。回家休息的人已经来上班，专家们还在那里忙碌着。有一次一位专家病倒了，医生要他休息七天，但他第二天就来工作，走几步脸上就累得出虚汗，走几步就得坐下休息一会，但他仍然坚持着——为了不影响工程的进展。前几天，一位专家支气管疼得很厉害，他一面用手按着胸一面忙着工作。大家劝他去治，他说：“工作太忙，不能离开！”接连劝了三次，他仍然不听；后来大家硬把汽车开来，再次让他去病院，他还是不离开，说：“星期一再去吧，不能因为我生病影响了工作！”每一位专家，在工作当中都表现了这样的热忱，每一件事情，那怕是一件小事，工作上的一个细节，他们都热心地为我们筹划着。为了机座上的垫铁，专家曾经亲自跑到当地一个机械厂去交涉，要求协助。但那个机械厂并没有做过这种部件，工友们不敢动手，他就做起政治工作来，向工友们讲这个部件对整个安装工程的重要，告诉工友们不要犹疑：“什么都是人创造出来的！我教你们做！”于是他每天忙完了工地的工作，还跑到这个机械厂来教工友们技术，每块垫铁做好，他还自己动手研磨。电气工地放电缆的工程一开始，专家的两只手上就总是沾满了沥青，每天把工作布置完，自己就动手，电缆每个拐弯的地方做成什么样式好看，都细心地琢磨。工程上缺少什么小东西，他在上班的路上就注意找，看见地上有小螺丝、铁片，就拾起来。
    他们不仅是忘我地工作着，而且时时刻刻热情地把新技术传授给我们，他们殷切地期望着我们能迅速地掌握新的技术，能够运用新技术独立地建设自己的祖国。一位专家说过：“安装完了，没有培养出干部不算完成任务！”在他的倡议下，这里组织起来一个焊接训练班，他每天牺牲午睡的时间，为训练班写讲义，给工友们上课。为了这个训练班，他曾花费了很多精力，他知道，要讲得好，首先得使翻译同志能够懂得一些基本原理。于是他就叫翻译同志从头学习物理、化学，还带去看别人的操作，一面看一面讲金属焊接的过程，完了他又借了个电焊机，自己动手焊，焊一个就讲一遍，讲怎样焊法是错的，讲几种焊法的区别。讲完了，又叫翻译同志焊，他把着手教，直到把基本道理都教清楚，这才停下说：“你懂得了一些，将来我讲课就方便了！”我们的电焊、火焊技术水准还不高，钢架、钢管压力高的地方，自己不能焊，苏联专家整天在现场替我们焊接着这些重要部分。他们每个人都教会了一个徒弟。跟专家学会了先进的火焊方法的梁富告诉我：“刚一干活的时候，专家自己焊，叫我在旁边看着，过了几天就让我试试，我一试不行，铁水淌了一地，专家就把着我的两只手教我。一连多少天，老是这么教，有时候就一块儿爬在地下焊。我一有点进步他就说：‘好’。什么时候问，什么时候告诉，没有一回不耐烦！还老和我说：‘好好学，将来我走了就是你的责任了！’”几个月的工夫，梁富就已经能焊一些次要的部件，六月末他还到沈阳参加了管理局的推广先进经验大会，向全东北各个基本建设部门的工友介绍了这个新方法。在安装第一号锅炉的时候，重要的地方全得专家给焊，但在安装第二号锅炉的时候，张洪升工友就已经学会了电焊新方法，顶替了专家的工作。张洪升告诉我：“那时候，一有空专家就带我在架子上到处走，告诉我焊的时候应该注意什么事，还给我找书看，可惜我看不懂！……今天（六月二十三日），他又爬到架子上来，问我累不？还打算帮我焊一段呢！”每一位专家都是这样，巴不得一下就把他们的先进方法全都教给我们。专家一看见现场技术员用旧办法工作，马上就教给一个新方法，完了还嘱咐说：“你一定得把这个办法教给工友，我要考问他们，如果不会你要负责！”专家常常对我们的干部讲：“你们要很好地运用我们才行，将来我们回国你们好能够独立工作！”
    人的生命是最宝贵的，苏联专家们时时刻刻教导我们的干部要重视技术保安，一有机会他们就讲：“第一是人，其次才是机器；机器坏了还可以买，人死了就不能再活了！”专家所在的工地，厂房如果没有清扫，晚上如果没有照明设备，平台上如果没有栏杆，到高处干活不系安全带，他就不让施工。有一次他看见起重工吊汽缸时自己也站在上边，就大声制止：“这不行！在苏联这是犯法的！”他常说：“领导干部不重视保安，就要犯错误！”在锅炉工地，有时候几根卷扬机的铁索搭在
    一起，架工们就想爬上去解开，专家看见就很严厉地批评说：“一定要把陈旧的办法丢掉，这多么危险！要研究新办法，人不用爬上去也能解开！”他们不仅仅是非常注意技术保安，而且对工友们的健康也同样地关怀着。一位专家带严重的风湿症坚持工作，但他却不让工友们这样，一个工友眼睛被电焊火星打伤了仍然在调整一个机件，他就制止说： “宁肯今天不调整，你也要回去休息。到医务所点些眼药，用手巾扎上睡上一天一定会好！”
    像爱护自己祖国的财产一样，他们对工地的器材，——那怕是一小块铁板、一个螺丝，都非常珍惜。一位专家把院子里的旧材料堆叫做“金山”，说：“不注意它，就等于把金子丢在马路上！”安装的时候，一缺什么材料，他就带上技术员到旧料堆上去找，哪一堆上有些什么他都清清楚楚。梁森果同志为了帮助修配工地节省材料，自己亲自到旧材料堆上，用粉笔在能用的材料上给做出记号来。一位专家在设计管式起重机的时候，曾经给想出一个利用废料的方案，但隔了十分钟，他又说：“那个办法还要多费一张铁板，我又另想个办法。”当时就画了个草图，叫翻译同志给送去。一次，在下班以后，专家看见一台机器没有盖上，他就找来报纸给蒙上了，还嘱咐警卫人员好好看着，他说：“一个人是否爱护机器，就可以看出他是否爱自己的祖国！”这正是苏维埃人共产主义道德的具体表现。一位翻译同志说得好：“专家们走路的时候眼睛也老是不闲着！看见什么露在外边，顺手就给盖上！”
    为了中国的工业化，为了中国人民的幸福，他们付出了自己的全副精力。他们使我们很快地学会了世界上最先进的技术，学会了先进的管理方法；使得我们在走向工业化的道路上，少走很多弯路。六月末，这个工程队由于采用了苏联的先进方法，曾经得到管理局的嘉奖。这是苏联专家帮助的结果，这个荣誉应该归于热心帮助我们的人。他们做了这么多，但他们自己却还觉得并没有作什么！在我去访问一位专家的时候，他说：“应该表扬中国工人，我们并没有什么！”还说：“由于语言困难，我们做得还很不够！”
    世界上有什么友谊比这更崇高？在历史上谁能够找出这样的先例？只有在无产阶级革命胜利的年代里才会有这样的友谊，我们应该为此而感奋、欢呼：感谢斯大林！
