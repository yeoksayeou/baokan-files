Following the bloody incident in which fifty-two peaceful residents of Andong, China, were brutally killed and injured by American aircraft, and while their bloodstains were not yet dry, the American air force in Korea has again been carrying out large-scale incursions into China's Northeast airspace for several consecutive days, penetrating deep into the interior east of Benxi to conduct strafing and reconnaissance activities. Upon hearing this news, the anger and hatred of the people of our entire country will be further intensified.

Since July 12th, people from all walks of life, all parties, all groups, and all sectors of the people across the country have successively issued statements or given talks, unanimously supporting the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government, protesting the barbaric, despicable, and shameless provocative acts of the American aggressors. The Chinese people firmly expressed their determination to answer the direct provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. This proves that the heroic and powerful Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any provocations.

The conspiracies and tricks hidden behind the provocative actions of the American aggressors have long been seen through by the Chinese people. These heinous acts of directly infringing upon China's territorial airspace sovereignty are nothing more than a part of the American aggressors' adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure." The American aggressors are clearly and deliberately attempting to use this to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, expand the aggressive war in the Far East, and further threaten peace and security in the Far East and the world. From these heinous activities of the American aggressors, the Chinese people have seen a more serious situation in the Far East, and therefore have increased their vigilance a hundredfold. The Chinese people will strengthen their unity with the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to repel the American aggressors' actions to expand the war and undermine peace.

The American aggressors should not even think of escaping the serious responsibility they should bear for these provocative acts of directly aggressing against the Chinese people. We want to warn the American aggressors: the provocative actions you have taken can only arouse greater anger and opposition from the Chinese people, the Korean people, and even the peace-loving people of the world, and will be subject to due punishment, and will never obtain what you vainly attempt to obtain on the battlefield or at the negotiation table.

    以加强抗美援朝工作来回答美国侵略者的挑衅！
    我国安东和平居民五十二人惨遭美机打死打伤的流血事件发生之后，在他们的血迹还没有干的时候，美国侵朝空军又连日大规模地侵犯我国东北领空，深入本溪以东一带内地，进行扫射侦察的罪恶活动。消息传来，我全国人民的愤怒和仇恨将更加增强起来。
    自七月十二日以来，全国各阶层、各党派、各团体和各界人民，纷纷发表声明或谈话，一致拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长的严正声明，抗议美国侵略者的这种野蛮、卑鄙、无耻的挑衅行为。中国人民坚决表示要用加强抗美援朝工作的实际行动来回答美国侵略者的直接挑衅。这证明：英勇而强大的中国人民不是任何挑衅所能吓倒的。
    美国侵略者隐藏在他的挑衅行动后面的阴谋诡计，早已为中国人民所看穿。这些直接侵犯我国领空主权的罪恶行为，无非就是美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策的一部分。美国侵略者显然蓄意借此破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大远东侵略战争，以进一步威胁远东和世界的和平与安全。中国人民从美国侵略者的这些罪恶活动中看到了远东更加严重的局势，因而百倍提高了警惕。中国人民将以加强自己和亚洲与全世界爱好和平人民之间的团结，来打退美国侵略者扩大战争、破坏和平的行动。
    美国侵略者休想逃脱他对于这些直接侵略中国人民的挑衅行为所应负的严重责任。我们要警告美国侵略者：你们所采取的挑衅行为，只能引起中国人民、朝鲜人民乃至全世界爱好和平人民的更大愤怒和反对，并要受到应有的惩罚，而决不能取得你们在战场上或者在谈判会场上妄想取得的东西。
