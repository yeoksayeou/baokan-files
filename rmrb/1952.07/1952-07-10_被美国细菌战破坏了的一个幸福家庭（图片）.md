    VII. In certain streets, factories, dormitories, and windows in the Tiexi District of Shenyang City, many strange insects were discovered. Worker Guo Liyong saw more than two thousand flies in a small area on the roof of the factory building.
    VIII. One morning in early March, Yan Zongyao felt unwell as soon as he started work. He went to the factory's clinic to see Doctor Zhang Yuzeng, who could not find anything wrong with him. Dr. Zhang immediately wrote him a referral letter, asking him to go to the Tiexi Workers' Hospital for examination.
    IX. He took the referral letter, but did not go to the Workers' Hospital. Instead, he went back to work. Going to the Workers' Hospital would require asking for leave, and asking for leave would mean lost work time. It was during the "May Day" production competition, and he wanted to strive to be a model worker.
