Datong Mining Bureau Overcomes One-Sided Views and Promptly Revises Production Quotas

In mid-May, before the start of the production competition, the Datong Mining Bureau conducted a revision of production quotas, using facts to criticize the one-sided mass viewpoints of many leading cadres, and to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the masses, enabling production in June to exceed the original plan.

The Datong Mining Bureau's quotas were revised in November 1951, with a scheduled revision every six months. In recent months, due to the rising labor enthusiasm of the workers, and the continuous national investment in increasing tools and improving working conditions, the old quotas have lagged far behind the actual situation. Not only has the production efficiency of advanced groups greatly exceeded the quotas, but the production efficiency of general groups has also broken through the quotas by a large margin. Therefore, from January to April, the state's production tasks were not completed, but the wage portion of the cost exceeded the budget by 3.36 billion yuan. There were also many unreasonable aspects to the quotas at the time: regardless of the quality of tool allocation, the quality of the tools, or the objective conditions of the work surface, the quotas were the same. As a result, workers with similar technical abilities and labor attitudes often experienced different outcomes due to the tools they used and the work surface they were on, with some exceeding the quota by a large margin and others not even reaching it. Workers were very dissatisfied with these situations, and production was greatly affected.

However, most of the bureau and mine-level leading cadres of the Datong Mining Bureau had some incorrect understandings. Many people believed that since it had just been said when mobilizing workers to discuss the plan at the end of March and beginning of April that the quotas would remain unchanged for a certain period, revising them now would be like slapping themselves in the face! They described revising quotas as "tightening screws," thinking that each revision would raise them higher and higher, just like screws getting tighter and tighter, which would reduce workers' wage income, thus causing worker dissatisfaction and affecting worker morale. They said that if the wage portion was exceeded, other methods could be found (such as launching a competition) to make up for it, and that they shouldn't just "pinch pennies" on wages. In short, these ideas all pitted the revision of quotas against the interests of the workers. They seemed to be very concerned about the interests of the masses, but in reality, it was a one-sided mass viewpoint that did not proceed from developing production—the long-term interests of the working class.

After the responsible comrades of the North China Administrative Committee and the Coal Mine Management General Bureau discovered this problem, they repeatedly instructed the Datong Mining Bureau to ensure that the revision of quotas was done well before the competition began in May of this year. Only then did the Datong Mining District Party Committee begin to conduct ideological mobilization within the Party. The administrative leadership also held symposiums with labor models, advanced producers, and activists to understand the thoughts of the masses. The ideas of the masses were exactly the opposite of those of the leading cadres. Everyone felt that the quotas were too low and could not encourage everyone to work hard to improve production efficiency. They asked for appropriate increases and put forward many opinions on the unreasonableness of the quotas, requesting revisions. The new quota standards proposed by advanced workers were much higher than those considered by the leadership. This made leaders at all levels fully realize that their thinking was lagging behind the masses.

The process and results of revising the quotas once again proved this point. After technical measurement and repeated discussions, the new advanced quotas were smoothly passed at the staff and workers' representative assembly. The new quotas were about 10% higher than the planned quotas, while also taking into account the differences in tools and work surfaces. After the new quotas were implemented, the workers' morale rose significantly, and new records were constantly appearing in various types of work. In June, the output exceeded the original plan by 11.2%, an increase of 15.42% compared to May. The average efficiency of all employees was 1.25 tons, an increase of 9.4% compared to May. The consumption of major materials such as explosives, pit props, and detonators was 26.4% lower than the original plan. Many advanced groups have broken through the new quotas and received excess bonuses. Some groups have not yet reached the new quotas. The leadership is now organizing and planning to hold advanced experience dissemination meetings for various types of work, and vigorously promoting advanced experience to help all workers quickly reach the new quotas.

    大同矿务局克服片面观点
    及时修改生产定额
    五月中旬，大同矿务局在生产竞赛开始以前，曾经进行了修改定额的工作，用事实批判了许多领导干部的片面群众观点，并激励了群众的劳动热情，使六月份的生产超过原订计划。
    大同矿务局的定额是一九五一年十一月修订的，原定半年修改一次。数月来，由于工人劳动热情的高涨，和国家不断投资增加工具、改进工作条件，旧的定额已大大落后于实际情况。不但先进小组的生产效率大大超过定额，就是一般小组的生产效率也都突破定额很多。所以，一至四月份中，国家的生产任务没有完成，但是成本中工资部分却超支了三十三亿六千多万元。当时的定额也有很多不合理之处：不管工具配备的好坏，工具质量的优劣，以及工作面的客观条件如何，定额都是一样。因而，常有技术能力和劳动态度差不多的工人，因为所用工具和所在工作面不同，结果，有的超过定额很多，有的还达不到定额。工人对这些情况很不满意，生产受到很大影响。
    但是，大同矿务局大多数局和矿一级的领导干部却存在着一些不正确的认识。很多人认为在三月底四月初发动工人讨论计划时刚说过定额在一定时期内不变，现在又来修改，岂非自己打自己的嘴吧！他们把修改定额说成是“拧螺丝钉”，以为修改一次提高一次，就像螺丝钉越拧越紧一样，这样会使工人的工资收入减少，因而引起工人不满，影响工人生产情绪。他们说，工资部分超过了，可以想别的办法（比如发动竞赛）来弥补，不要只在工资上面打“小算盘”。总之，这些想法都是把修改定额和工人的利益对立起来，看来似乎很关心群众利益，实际上是一种不从发展生产——工人阶级的长远利益出发的片面的群众观点。
    华北行政委员会和煤矿管理总局的负责同志发现了这个问题后，一再指示大同矿务局，必须在今年五月展开竞赛之前把修改定额的工作搞好。这时大同矿区党委才开始在党内进行思想动员。行政领导方面又召开劳动模范、先进生产者和积极分子座谈会，了解群众思想情况。群众的想法和领导干部的想法恰恰相反，大家都感到定额太低，不能鼓励大家努力提高生产效率，要求适当提高，同时对定额的不合理提出了很多意见，要求修改。先进工人们提出的新定额标准比领导方面考虑的还要高得多。这才使各级领导干部充分认识到自己的思想是落后于群众的。
    修改定额的过程和修改定额的结果，也再次证明了这一点。经过技术测定和反复讨论，在职工代表大会上顺利地通过了新的先进的定额。新的定额比计划定额提高了百分之十左右，同时照顾了工具和工作面的不同。新的定额实行后，工人的情绪显著高涨，各工种的新纪录不断出现。六月份的产量超过原计划的百分之十一点二，比五月份增加了百分之十五点四二。全员效率平均为一点二五吨，比五月份提高了百分之九点四。火药、坑木、雷管等主要材料的消耗比原计划降低了百分之二十六点四。许多先进小组都突破了新定额，得到了超额奖励。有些小组还没有达到新定额。现在领导方面正有组织有计划地召开各工种的先进经验传播会议，大力推广先进经验，以便帮助全体工人很快地达到新定额。             （冠生）
