    Commemorating the Party's Birthday, Continuing to Strive to Improve Oneself
    Gao Yu-bao
    When commemorating the Party's birthday, my feelings are many. Since I wrote a book, many comrades have written to me, saying how glorious Gao Yu-bao is. But comrades, in my heart, I feel that this glory cannot be attributed to me personally in any way; this glory belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao. Because the Party and Chairman Mao cultivated and educated me. Think about it, if there were no cultivation and education from the Party and Chairman Mao, could a poor child like me, who herded pigs and begged for food, have what I have today? Since I was a child, I lived a sad, beast-of-burden life in a poor family. There was nothing to eat at home; the Japanese devils and traitorous bullies still came to demand money and taxes every day. My father couldn't afford such heavy taxes and was beaten and punished, and the family had even less money to send me to school. Once I went to the school to take a look and was beaten by the local bully (I used to herd pigs for him). He hit me with his cane while scolding me: "You eat from my bowl, so you have to be under my control. If I see you coming here to play again, I'll break your legs! Is this a place for you poor kids?" Only after liberation did we stand up, and the family was allocated land. In order to avenge my grandfather, mother, uncle, and younger brother who died unjustly in the old society, I joined the army. At first, my class consciousness was not high, but later, under the Party's education, I gradually improved and gloriously joined the Communist Party. In the army, I seized every opportunity to study culture. The characters I wrote at first were crooked and ugly, and a few palm-sized characters would use up a whole notebook. But I was determined to keep learning. Why? I felt that I was a Communist Party member, and under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, no matter how great the difficulties, they could not stop those who were determined. A Communist Party member has no insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, I felt it was too much trouble to study culture and didn't want to learn. I would check my determination and conduct self-criticism: "I am a Party member, I should not stop studying. I suffered in the old society and couldn't study. Now that I have such a good opportunity, if I don't study hard, how can I be worthy of the Party? How can I be worthy of the people?" In this way, the enthusiasm would come again. Looking back now, wasn't it due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao that I was able to escape the oppression of the old society? Wasn't it also due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao that I, an ordinary soldier, an illiterate, was able to learn some culture and write a book? The glorious title of Communist Party member constantly encourages me, enabling me to continue to advance under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, when commemorating the Party's birthday, my heart is filled with gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao's life-saving kindness, and gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education. Although I have written a book, I still cannot express all of these grateful feelings.
    I am not good enough in many aspects. When commemorating the Party's birthday, I feel even more that I need to continue to work hard to improve myself.
    Politically, I must first improve, and often use the eight conditions of a Party member to measure myself, so that I can be a good Party member.
    Culturally, I must also continue to improve.
    Now I have been transferred to the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission. The higher authorities transferred me here to better cultivate and educate me. I will certainly live up to the hopes of the Party and the higher authorities and strive to improve myself.
    My book is undergoing its second revision. With the instructions and help of the comrades in the Cultural Department of the General Political Department, my confidence has increased even more. I plan to work hard and revise the first half next year.
    These are my thoughts when commemorating the Party's birthday.

    纪念党的生日，继续努力提高自己
    高玉宝
    当纪念党的生日的时候，我的感想是很多的。自从我写了一本书后，有许多同志写信给我，说高玉宝怎样光荣。可是同志们，我心里头觉得这光荣无论如何也不能归到我个人身上来；这光荣是属于党和毛主席的。因为党和毛主席培养了我和教育了我。想想，要是没有党和毛主席培养和教育，像我这个给人家放过猪要过饭的穷孩子，还能有今天吗？我从小就在贫苦的家庭中过着伤心的牛马生活。家中没有什么吃的；日本鬼子和汉奸恶霸们还天天去要款，要税；我父亲拿不上那样重的税，挨过打，受过罚，家中更没有钱给我念书。有一次我到学校里去看看，还被阎王保长打了一顿（那时我给他放猪）。他用文明棍一边打我，一边骂我：“你端我的碗就得受我管。我再看你到这里来玩，把你腿给打断！这地方是你们穷小子来的吗？”解放以后，我们才翻了身，家里分到了土地，我为了替屈死在旧社会的爷爷、母亲、叔叔和弟弟报仇，参加了部队。当初，我的阶级觉悟还不高，后来在党的教育下，一步步提高了，光荣地加入了共产党。我在部队里，天天抓紧时间学文化，最初写的字，歪七扭八的很难看，巴掌大的字，写几个就把一个本子用完了。但是我有决心学下去。为什么呢？我觉得我是共产党员，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，有天大的困难也难以挡住有决心的人，一个共产党员没有克服不了的困难。有时候，我学文化嫌麻烦了，不想学了，我就查查决心，来个自我批评：“自己是个党员，不应当不学习。从前在旧社会受苦不能读书，今天有这样好的机会，再不好好学习，我对得起党吗？我对得起人民吗？”这样一来，劲头就又来了。现在回想起来，我能摆脱旧社会的压迫，这不是由于党和毛主席的领导吗？我能从一个普通的战士，一个大字不识的文盲学得了些文化，写了一本书，这不也是由于党和毛主席的领导吗？共产党员的光荣称号，时时鼓舞着我，使我在党的领导下能够不断前进。因此，在纪念党的生日的时候，我满心里感谢党和毛主席的救命恩情，感谢党和毛主席的培养和教育。我虽然写了一本书，但是我的这些感激的心情还是写不出来的。
    我在各方面都很不够，在纪念党的生日的时候，更觉得需要继续努力提高自己。
    政治上首先要提高，要常用党员标准的八项条件衡量自己，使自己作一个好党员。
    文化上也要继续提高。
    现在我已被调到军委总政治部文化部里来了。上级调我到这里来，是为了更好地培养我、教育我，我一定不辜负党和上级的希望，努力提高自己。
    我的书正在第二次修改中。有了总政治部文化部同志们的指示、帮助，我的信心更提高了，我计划好好努力，明年把上半部修改出来。
    这些就是我在纪念党的生日时的感想。
