National state-owned coal mines have completed and exceeded the state production plan for the first half of 1952 by 3.9 percent. Among them, the Northeast region exceeded it by 4.9 percent, the North China region by 3 percent, the East China region by 1 percent, the Central South region by 5.6 percent, and the Southwest region exceeded the plan by 9 percent. Compared with the same period in 1951, the national average output increased by 61.6 percent. The Northeast region increased by 34.2 percent, the North China region increased by 173.7 percent, the East China region increased by 23.2 percent, the Central South region increased by 59.9 percent, and the Southwest region increased by 34.8 percent. Coal production is growing rapidly with the development of China's industry and the improvement of people's lives.

In the first half of this year, due to the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of coal miners, the study of advanced Soviet experiences, and the criticism of bourgeois conservative technical viewpoints, new national records were continuously created in coal mining and tunneling. First, under the conditions of poor geological conditions and insufficient mechanical equipment in the Pingxiang Coal Mine in the Central South region, the Feng Jiali, Xiao Chengxiang, and Zhong Xinai team of the Wangjiayuan Mine used hand-held coal mining on February 5 to create an unprecedented record of 162 tons in eight hours. Subsequently, the Qu Lülian team created a new record of 173.3 tons on March 11, and the Yan Fuyuan team produced 167 tons in six and a half hours on March 13. In order to welcome the "May Day" festival, the Chen Yuhua pneumatic pick team of the "May Day" brigade of the Xinzhuangzi Mine in the Huainan Coal Mine in the East China region used the leapfrog cyclic operation method to create a new national record of 291.6 tons of pneumatic pick coal mining in five hours and forty-seven minutes on April 28, with a recovery rate of 99 percent.

In terms of rapid tunneling, the Ma Liuhai team of 23 people from the Datong Coal Mine in the North China region adopted a multi-hole cyclic operation method based on the principle of professional division of labor, and tunneled 514 meters in April. The Cui Guoshan team of 65 people from the Jixi Coal Mine in the Northeast region studied the Soviet Golovin rapid tunneling method, adopted a multi-heading simultaneous heading method based on the principle of fixed personnel and mobile technology, and tunneled 703 meters in April, with a maximum daily progress record of 44.95 meters. The Luo Chunhe team of 56 people from the Pingxiang Coal Mine adopted a multi-heading simultaneous heading method and created a new national record of 47.6 meters per day on June 23. The No. 1 and No. 2 teams of the Shimen Iron and Steel team of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, with a total of 42 people, set a record of 47.4 meters of tunneling on June 28.

In order to summarize and promote advanced experiences, more than 100 national coal mine tunneling labor models held an experience exchange conference at the Beidaihe Coal Mine Workers' Sanatorium in June this year. The conference was presided over by the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union. Based on the criteria of "high efficiency, good quality, and low cost," the conference finally affirmed the advanced experiences in tunneling work such as the large-hole deep-hole blasting method of the Hongliujing well of the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong, the hollow blasting method of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, the one-time continuous blasting method of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, and the wind-duct ventilation method of the 84 tunneling team of the Hongshan Coal Mine. These experiences greatly enriched the content of Ma Liuhai and Cui Guoshan's advanced tunneling methods. Therefore, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department has instructed state-owned coal mines in North China and East China to earnestly promote the above-mentioned experiences as part of Ma Liuhai's multi-hole cyclic operation method.

### 全国国营煤矿超额完成上半年生产计划

    全国国营煤矿超额完成上半年生产计划
    全国国营煤矿工业一九五二年上半年的国家生产计划，已完成并超过百分之三点九。其中东北区超过百分之四点九，华北区超过百分之三，华东区超过百分之一，中南区超过百分之五点六，西南区超额完成百分之九；和一九五一年同期比较，全国平均增产百分之六十一点六。其中东北区增加百分之三十四点二，华北区增加百分之一百七十三点七，华东区增加百分之二十三点二，中南区增加百分之五十九点九，西南区增加百分之三十四点八。煤的生产正随着我国工业的发展和人民生活的改善而迅速地增长着。
    今年上半年由于煤矿工人政治觉悟不断提高，学习了苏联的先进经验，批判了资产阶级的保守技术观点，在采煤和掘进方面连续创造了全国新纪录。首先，中南区萍乡煤矿在地质情况很差，机械设备不够的条件下，王家源矿场的冯家礼、萧成祥、钟细乃组在二月五日手镐采煤，创造了八小时生产一百六十二吨的空前纪录。接着，瞿绿连组又在三月十一日创造一百七十三点三吨的新纪录，三月十三日晏福元组更以六小时半生产一百六十七吨。华东区淮南煤矿为了迎接“五一”节，新庄子矿“五一”大队陈玉华风镐组用腾挪式循环作业法在四月二十八日创造以五小时四十七分生产二百九十一点六吨的风镐采煤全国新纪录，回收率达到百分之九十九。
    快速掘进方面，华北区大同煤矿马六孩组二十三人，根据专业分工的原则，采用多孔道循环作业法，四月份掘进五百一十四公尺。东北区鸡西煤矿崔国山队六十五人学习苏联郭洛温快速掘进法，根据人员固定技术流动的原则，采用多巷道同时进巷法，四月份掘进七百零三公尺，日进最高纪录为四十四点九五公尺。萍乡煤矿罗春和组五十六人，采用多巷道同时进巷法，六月二十三日创造日进四十七点六公尺的全国新纪录。萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队一、二两组四十二人，在六月二十八日又创了掘四十七点四公尺的纪录。
    为了总结和推广先进经验，今年六月间，全国煤矿掘进劳动模范一百多人，在北戴河煤矿工人休养所里，举行了交流经验大会。大会由中国煤矿工会全国委员会主持，根据“效率高、质量好、成本低”的标准，最后肯定了山东洪山煤矿洪六井的大眼深孔爆破法，焦作矿务局的空心放炮法，阜新矿务局的一次连炮法，以及洪山煤矿八四掘进队的夹风道通风办法等项掘进工作中的先进经验。这些经验大大丰富了马六孩和崔国山的先进掘进工作法的内容。因此中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局已指示华北、华东各国营煤矿，必须把上述经验作为马六孩多孔道循环作业法的一部分，认真加以推广。
