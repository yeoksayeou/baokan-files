Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 25th: Responsible persons from returned overseas Chinese associations in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Fuqing, Nan'an, Putian, Yongchun and other places, who are holding a meeting in Fuzhou City, jointly issued a statement on the 24th, supporting the petition movement of overseas Chinese in Thailand demanding a reduction in the "Alien Personal Certificate Fee," and protesting the Thai government's persecution and extortion of our overseas Chinese compatriots. The statement first explained: On February 4 this year, the Thai government arbitrarily increased the "Alien Personal Certificate Fee" from 20 baht per person per year to 400 baht. The purpose of this was to extort a large amount of money from our overseas Chinese compatriots to supplement its deficit in carrying out an arms race to follow American imperialism. The Thai government also attempted to force our overseas Chinese compatriots who were unable to pay the "fee" to become coolies through this unreasonable measure, and even force them to become soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in Taiwan, collecting cannon fodder for American imperialism.

The statement pointed out: Overseas Chinese in Thailand launched a large-scale petition movement demanding a reduction in the "Alien Personal Certificate Fee" in order to protect their survival and rights. This is completely reasonable. However, the Thai government ignored the just demands of our overseas Chinese compatriots and reiterated this unreasonable measure on June 18. The Thai government's brutal persecution and shameless extortion are absolutely intolerable to the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and the people of the whole country. We firmly support the just demands of overseas Chinese in Thailand. We warn the Thai government that if it persists in its own way and continues to extort and persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots, it will inevitably suffer the consequences.

    福州、厦门等地归国华侨联谊会负责人联合发表声明
    抗议泰国政府对我国侨胞的迫害和勒索
    【新华社福州二十五日电】正在福州市举行会议的福州、厦门、福清、南安、莆田、永春等地归国华侨联谊会负责人，于二十四日联合发表声明，支持泰国华侨要求减低“外侨随身证例费”的请愿运动，抗议泰国政府对我国侨胞的迫害和勒索。声明首先说明：今年二月四日，泰国政府横蛮地将“外侨随身证例费”由每人每年二十铢增加到四百铢，其目的是勒索我国侨胞的大批钱财，以补充其为了追随美帝国主义实行扩军备战的费用的不足。泰国政府还企图通过这一无理措施，强迫无力缴纳“例费”的我国侨胞充当苦工，甚至强迫他们充当台湾蒋匪军队的士兵，替美帝国主义搜集炮灰。
    声明指出：泰国华侨为了保护自己的生存和权利，展开了要求减低“外侨随身证例费”的大规模的请愿运动，这是完全合理的。而泰国政府竟然不顾我国侨胞的正义要求，于六月十八日重申这一无理措施。泰国政府这种残暴的迫害和无耻的勒索行为，是我国广大归国华侨、华侨家属和全国人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们坚决支持泰国华侨的正义要求。我们警告泰国政府，假如它一意孤行，继续勒索、迫害我国侨胞，必然会自食其恶果。
