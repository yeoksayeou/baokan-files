    朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会进入行政性会议
    【新华社开城四日电】三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方建议根据停战协定草案第五十一款关于释放与遣返双方全部战俘的规定（该款条文为：本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。）和五十二款关于战俘在遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争的规定，将双方战俘按照国籍和地区重行分类，并据此校正名单，以使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活。我方并提议双方代表团大会进入行政性会议。四日双方代表团大会上，对方同意进入行政性会议，行政性会议的内容将不公开发表，这一会议的形式将继续进行，直至目前的问题获得解决或双方中任何一方希望恢复公开会议时为止。
