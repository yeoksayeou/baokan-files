    Hygiene Work in Liulin Village, Pingyuan
    Jia Weilian
    Leaving Lin County City, Pingyuan, and heading north along the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains for fifteen li, you arrive at a beautiful mountain village - Liulin Village. This is a clean and tidy village, presenting a new atmosphere both inside and outside. The village is surrounded by a vast basin, which this year harvested a wheat crop that had not been seen in years. Now, it is covered with green seedlings as far as the eye can see.
    It may be hard to believe, but on this beautiful, prosperous, and happy land, just like other villages in the past, poverty, backwardness, dirt, and disease were caused by the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets. In the past, this area was a "half-year diet of bran and vegetables" region, suffering from cruel feudal exploitation for a long time. Farmers toiled and lived like beasts of burden year after year, eating coarse bran for most of the year, only able to eat three meals of wheat flour after the wheat harvest – one meal of noodles, one meal of steamed buns, and one meal of flatbread. The village had a low-lying terrain, easily accumulating sewage. In the past, only a dozen households had livestock, and because the houses were narrow and they were afraid of thieves, the livestock-raising households all practiced "human and livestock cohabitation," with livestock living on one side and people on the other, with cooking done in the middle. As a result, flies swarmed, and the house was full of dung and filth; the streets and courtyards were full of livestock manure, children's excrement, and dung heaps. Many people did not wash their hands or faces for years, nor did they wash or change their clothes, nor did they wash their pots and bowls. Consequently, this small village of eighty-odd households with more than four hundred people constantly had more than a dozen people sick, suffering from diseases such as malaria, dysentery, typhus, and infant tetanus, which seriously harmed the people here. The whole village had eight or nine children born each year, but on average, ten or more adults and children died each year due to illness.
    Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came, and the farmers of Liulin Village were liberated, politically and economically emancipated, and also learned how to practice hygiene and prevent diseases.
    Liulin Village carried out land reform in 1948, and in the autumn of 1949, it carried out democratic governance, establishing a health organization. After just over two short years, the whole village has completely changed, and hygiene work has leaped forward at an incredible speed.
    In the past, almost every household suffered from malaria and dysentery every year. But since last year, these two diseases have disappeared. They humorously said: "Two packets of malaria pills were brought from Zhangde (Anyang City) the year before last, and they haven't even been opened yet!" In the past, there were often more than a dozen people sick, but since the development of hygiene work, there have been no infectious diseases. The days of sickness and suffering have passed in Liulin Village. The mortality rate has been significantly reduced. The villagers remember that before land reform, the number of deaths each year was at least a dozen, and at most over thirty. Due to the reduction of infectious diseases, the mortality rate in Liulin Village in 1951 was reduced to seven per thousand.
    The achievements in environmental hygiene are also very prominent. First, they basically eliminated flies. Eliminating flies is not easy even in modern hygienic cities, but eliminating flies in a rural area that still uses feces as fertilizer is truly remarkable! Their main method is to prevent flies from breeding. Under the slogan of "Clean Streets and Courtyards," they renovated all the toilets; built leak-proof pits with tight covers, and moved all the dung heaps in the village to outside the village, some of which were also covered with mud to make compost (these mud-covered dung heaps can ferment and generate high heat, killing the fly maggots and all parasite eggs and germs in the feces. Fermented manure rots quickly and is much better for the fields than raw manure). Every household has done these things. They eliminated lice. In the past, "sweat disease" (typhus) was very common in this area, and everyone had countless lice. Since advocating "Clean Clothes and Bedding" and "Clean Body," every household washes clothes every five days and suns bedding every three days. In June 1951, they built a public bathhouse; men were responsible for carrying and changing water, and women were responsible for burning firewood, divided into groups for men and women to take turns bathing. At first, some women felt uncomfortable and embarrassed to bathe; after doing it a few times, they got used to it. Some old ladies rushed to take a second bath after others finished, saying: "I've lived for more than sixty years and never even heard of a bathhouse. I have to wash more! If it weren't for the new society, I wouldn't have to wash in this lifetime!" The farmers of Liulin Village have completely eliminated lice by maintaining "Clean Clothes and Bedding" and "Clean Body," thus eradicating typhus transmitted by lice. They have also achieved clean eating habits. Every household renovated their kitchens, and the dish racks were covered with cloth curtains, and the pots and bowls were washed three times a day; they measured the rice and put it in the pot without leaving leftover rice or dishes; and they also made sure that everyone drank boiled water (they also carried boiled water when working in the fields), basically eliminating the phenomenon of drinking raw water. Due to these major changes in customs and habits, not a single dysentery patient was found in Liulin Village last year, which played a significant role in ensuring production.
    There have also been great achievements in maternal and child health. The old method of delivery, which was most harmful to the health of mothers and infants, has gradually disappeared, and the original old midwives have all received new-method training. In the past, some women had given birth to nine children, but eight of them died from "postpartum wind." In 1951, thirteen babies were born in the whole village, twelve of whom grew up very well, only one died of "postpartum wind" because the mother used the old method of delivery. After this incident, it was blamed by men and women throughout the village. The four babies born in the first half of this year were all delivered using the new method, and they are growing very strongly. General attention has also been paid to menstrual hygiene for women. In the past, they used rags and old covers for menstrual pads, and after use, they were not washed but placed in dirty places out of sight. They said: "Washing dirty things with water is a sin," and "Sun exposure will cause stomachaches and give birth to monsters." Therefore, menstrual diseases, leucorrhea, and infertility were very common. Now, some unexpected new things are happening in the countryside. Sanitary napkins (women's menstrual belts) are sold in large and small cooperatives in Lin County, Pingyuan Province. The demand for "sanitary napkins" is so great that they have become a necessary item for those peddlers and egg-trading vendors who run around the countryside. Women generally buy new "sanitary napkins," and some make their own with white cloth, and they all wash them after use, scald them with boiling water, dry them in the sun, wrap them up, and hide them in the closet. They have also organized inspection teams to conduct spot checks every month. In the past two years, the number of people suffering from menstrual diseases has been greatly reduced, to less than one-fifth of what it used to be. In order to take care of children during the busy farming season, protect children's safety, and allow mothers to work with peace of mind, Liulin Village held three busy-season childcare groups last year, regularly accommodating thirty-five children, partially solving the difficulty of women taking care of children. This method was immediately welcomed by farmers, especially women. This year, they built five new rooms and established a "long-term busy-season nursery" to solve the problem of taking care of babies.

    平原柳林村的卫生工作
    贾伟廉
    出平原林县城，顺着太行山的东麓往北走十五里，就到了一个美丽的山村——柳林村。这是一个整洁的村庄，村里村外都呈现着一片新气象。村子周围是一片广大的盆地，这块盆地，今年曾收获了几年来所没有过的麦收。现在又长起了一眼看不到边的绿苗。
    说起来谁也不信，就在这块美丽、富裕、快乐的土地上，以前和其他乡村一样，因为敌伪长期统治而造成了贫困、落后、肮脏和疾病。过去这里是“糠菜半年粮”的地区，长期遭受着残酷的封建压榨，农民经年牛马似地劳动和生活，却成年地吃粗糠，只有麦收后才能吃上三顿麦子面——一顿面条、一顿馒头、一顿面饼。这村地势低洼，容易积存污水。过去只有十来户有牲口，因为房屋窄小又怕坏人偷牲口，养牲口的户都是“人畜同居”，一头住牲口，一头住人，当中作饭。因此苍蝇成群，满屋粪污；街院里到处是牲口粪、孩子屎尿和粪堆。许多人成年地不洗手脸，衣服也不洗换，锅碗也不刷。结果，这八十几户四百多口人的小村常年不断地有十多个人生病，像疟疾、痢疾、斑疹伤寒、婴儿破伤风等病，严重地侵害着这里的人们。全村每年出生八、九个孩子，但平均每年大人小孩因病死亡的就达十来口人。
    毛主席和共产党来了，柳林村农民解放了，在政治和经济上翻了身，也懂得了怎样讲卫生，预防疾病。
    柳林村一九四八年进行了土地改革，一九四九年秋天进行了民主建政工作，成立了卫生组织。经过了短短的两年多，全村各方面都完全变了样，卫生工作也以令人难以置信的速度向前飞跃着。
    过去家家户户每年几乎没有不闹疟疾和痢疾的。但是从去年起这两种病已经见不到了。他们幽默地说：“前年有个医生从彰德（安阳市）捎来两包疟疾丸，还一直没开包呢！”过去经常有十几个人闹病，但开展卫生工作以后，传染病没有了。多病多难的日子，在柳林村已经过去了。死亡率显著地降低。老乡们记得土地改革以前每年死人少则十几个，最多到过三十来个，由于减少了传染病，柳林村一九五一年的死亡率降低到千分之七。
    环境卫生方面的成绩也是很突出的。第一，他们基本上消灭了苍蝇。在现代卫生设备的都市里消灭苍蝇已经不简单，但在这一个还用粪便当肥料的农村里消灭了苍蝇，该是一件多么不平凡的事！他们最主要的办法就是不准苍蝇繁殖。在“街院净”的口号下，他们改造了所有的厕所；砌了不漏水的坑，加上严密的盖子，把村内的粪堆统统搬到村外，一部分还墁上泥作成堆肥（这种用泥墁起来的粪堆里面能发酵生高热，杀死粪里的苍蝇蛆卵和所有的寄生虫卵和病菌。发过酵的粪会很快地沤熟，用来上地比生粪要好得多）。家家户户都作到了这几点。他们消灭了虱子。过去这一带“汗病”
    （斑疹伤寒）很多，人人都长着无数的虱子。自从提倡“衣被净”“身体净”，家家都作到衣服五天一洗、被褥三天一晒。又在一九五一年六月里修起公共澡塘；男的管挑水、换水，女的管烧火，分成小组男女轮流洗澡。起初有些妇女觉得不习惯，不好意思洗；经办过几次以后，她们也就习惯了。有的老太太等别人洗完又赶着洗第二次，说：“咱活了六十多岁，听也没听说过澡塘，可要多洗洗哩！要不是新社会，这辈子就不用洗啦！”柳林村的农民由于作到“衣被净、身体净”，就彻底消灭了虱子，因而虱子传染的斑疹伤寒也就从此断了根。他们也作到了饮食干净。家家改造了厨房，碗格子都挂上了布帘，锅碗每天刷洗三遍；量米下锅不剩饭、剩菜；又作到了人人喝开水（下地干活也都提上开水），基本上消灭了喝生水的现象。由于这些改风移俗的大变动，柳林村去年没有发现一个痢疾病人，在保证生产上起了很大的作用。
    妇幼卫生方面也有很大的成绩。危害母亲和婴儿健康最大的旧法接产逐渐绝迹了，原来的旧接生婆都受过了新法训练。过去有的生产了九个孩子，因为“四六风”死去了八个。一九五一年全村生了十三个娃娃，其中十二个都长得很好，只有一个因为产妇用旧法接生，孩子得“四六风”死了。这件事发生后，受到了全村男男女女的埋怨。今年上半年出生的四个娃娃，全是用新法接产的，长的都很壮。妇女经期卫生也得到普遍的注意，过去都是用破布烂套子垫月经，用后不洗就放在不见人的脏地方。她们说：“脏东西用水洗就作孽了”、“太阳晒过就要肚子疼，生怪胎”。因此月经病、白带病、不生育的现象非常普遍。现在，有些想不到的新事就在乡村里发生了，在平原省林县大大小小的合作社里都卖着卫生带（妇女月经带）。“卫生带”的需要如此之大，成了那些跑乡村的“货郎”担、换鸡蛋的小贩必备的货色。妇女们一般都买了新的“卫生带”，有的用白布自己作，并且都作到了用后洗净，用开水烫过，再晒干包好藏在柜子里。她们并组织了检查小组，每月进行抽查。两年来，患月经病的已经大大减少，不到从前的五分之一了。为了在农忙时间使孩子有人照顾，保护孩子安全，让母亲安心生产，柳林村去年举办了三个农忙托儿组，经常收容三十五个孩子，部分地解决了妇女带孩子的困难。这个办法立刻受到农民尤其是妇女的普遍的欢迎。今年他们新修起五间房，成立了“长期农忙托儿所”，解决带娃娃的问题。
