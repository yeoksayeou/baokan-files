    The Work of Receiving and Dispatching Should Not Be Underestimated
    To the Editor: In the organizational consolidation work of various agencies after the "Three-Anti" campaign, it was found that some comrades—including those engaged in receiving and dispatching work—underestimated the work, regarding it as "an auxiliary and extremely simple odd job," or feeling that receiving and dispatching work was "the least promising," believing that "only incompetent people" do this kind of work. They looked down on receiving and dispatching work and were unwilling to undertake and study it. Some people who do receiving and dispatching work, when asked what they do, would vaguely say "doing nothing," unwilling to directly say that they are doing receiving and dispatching work. They are very afraid of being "looked down upon" because of it. When the leadership seeks their opinions on work, they say: "I am willing to do anything except receiving and dispatching work." If they are assigned to receiving and dispatching work, their thinking becomes "incomprehensible."
    The reason for these erroneous ideas and views is mainly because some people have not recognized the importance of receiving and dispatching work, and have not recognized that it is an indispensable part of revolutionary work. They do not know how much loss will be caused to the entire revolutionary work if the receiving and dispatching work is not done well, resulting in accumulated documents, lost documents, and other errors!
    I believe that all agencies should pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of underestimating receiving and dispatching work.

    Editor's note: In this newspaper's report on the rational use of specialized technical personnel, it was pointed out that cadres with specialized skills should not be assigned to do clerical and receiving/dispatching work. However, this does not mean that "receiving and dispatching work is not important." Personnel suitable for doing receiving and dispatching work should continue to do a good job in receiving and dispatching work. Because receiving and dispatching work is also an important part of revolutionary work. Comrade Li Zhenfu's opinion is correct.

### 不应轻视收发工作

    不应轻视收发工作
    编辑同志：在“三反”以后各机关的整编工作中，发现有一些同志——包括担任收发工作的同志，轻视收发工作，把收发工作看作是“附属的、极简单的勤杂工作”，或感到收发工作“最没出息”，认为“没有本事的人”才作这个工作。他们看不起收发工作，不愿担任和研究收发工作。一些作收发工作的人，一旦有人问他们作什么工作时，就含含糊糊地说“什么也作”，而不愿直截了当地说是作收发工作。他们很怕人家因此“瞧不起”他们。当领导方面征求他们对工作的意见时，他们说：“除了收发工作，什么也愿意作。”如果分配他们作收发工作时，他们的思想便要“搞不通”了。
    这些错误思想和观点的所以发生，主要是由于某些人没有认识到收发工作的重要性，没有认识到收发工作是革命工作中不可缺少的一部分。他们不知道，假使收发工作作不好，积压文件、遗失文件和发生其他错误，对整个革命工作将会有多大的损失！
    我认为各机关应注意纠正轻视收发工作的现象。
     皖南皖北人民行政公署办公厅秘书科    李振甫
    编者按：本报在关于合理地使用专门技术人材的报道中，曾指出不应该让有专门技术的干部分配去做文书、收发一类的工作。但是，这并不是说“收发工作不重要”。适合于做收发工作的人员，就应该继续坚持做好收发工作。因为收发工作也是革命工作的重要一环。李振甫同志的意见是正确的。
