    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 15th: The Indian people welcome the timely arrival of Chinese rice in India. The ship "Sennanbulis," carrying 6,200 tons of rice from China to India, arrived in Calcutta on the morning of the 5th. This is the first batch of 100,000 tons of rice being shipped from China to India, according to the contract recently signed by representatives of China and India in Beijing.
    On the evening of the 7th, Yao Zhongkang, Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Calcutta, held a tea party to celebrate the arrival of the Chinese rice. Governor of West Bengal, Mookerjee, was invited to attend. Also invited were senior officials from the Department of Agriculture of the West Bengal Provincial Government, the Commercial Counselor of the Soviet Union in Calcutta, the personnel in charge of the "Sennanbulis," representatives from the Calcutta India-China Friendship Association, prominent figures from the cultural world, journalists, and representatives of the Chinese community in Calcutta. All the guests praised the good quality and fair price of the rice and believed that it symbolized the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Indian people.
    All Indian newspapers published the news of the arrival of Chinese rice on their front pages. The Bengali daily "Liberty" in Calcutta published a commentary on the 9th, saying: "China's quick delivery of rice is a genuine expression of friendship towards India. Therefore, famine-stricken Bengal and India will express their heartfelt gratitude for the Chinese rice and will regard Sino-Indian friendship as something extremely precious."
    The newspaper compared China's rice delivery and the way it was done with the situation of American grain merchants, saying: The sole purpose of American capitalists is to profit from India's famine. American congressmen, when approving the shipment of grain to India in 1951, attempted to use grain as a bargaining chip to gain access to large uranium deposits. In addition to using grain as a bargaining chip to seize strategic raw materials, American capitalists also want to use financial means to plunge India into the abyss. However, the rice from China is not only priced very fairly, but it also does not put India in a difficult position. They accept Indian currency as payment and do not stipulate any conditions. In these two transactions, one is to obtain extra benefits, to sacrifice India's interests for the benefit of American warmongers; the other is an unconditional fair transaction, a particularly generous transaction to India. The newspaper said: "The rice from China will inspire the Indian people to further consolidate Sino-Indian friendship and smash the American ban on trade with China."

    我国输往印度的大米第一批运抵加尔各答
    印度各界人士认为这是我国人民对印度人民的友谊的象征
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度人民欢迎中国大米及时运抵印度。从中国装运大米六千二百吨到印度的轮船“森南布利斯号”于五日早晨抵达加尔各答。这是根据最近中印双方代表在北京所签订的合同，从中国输往印度的十万吨大米的第一批。
    七日晚，中华人民共和国驻加尔各答总领事姚仲康举行茶会庆祝中国大米的到达。西孟加拉总督慕寇吉应邀到会。应邀赴会的还有西孟加拉省政府农业部的高级官员、苏联驻加尔各答商务参赞、“森南布利斯号”船的负责人员、加尔各答印中友好协会的代表、文化界的著名人士、新闻记者及加尔各答华侨代表等。所有的来宾都称赞大米的品质好，价格公道，并认为这象征着中国人民对印度人民的友谊。
    印度所有的报纸，都在第一版刊载了中国大米运到的消息。加尔各答的孟加拉文日报“自由报”九日发表评论说：“中国很快就把大米运来，是中国对印度真正友好的表示。因此，闹饥荒的孟加拉省与印度将对于中国的大米表示衷心的感谢，并将把印中友谊看作是非常宝贵的事情。”
    该报把中国运来大米以及运送的方式和美国粮食商人的情形作一比较说：美国资本家的唯一目的，是趁印度闹饥荒时从中牟利。美国的众议院议员在一九五一年赞成把粮食运往印度时就曾企图以粮食作为交换条件，而使大量的铀矿蕴藏落到他们手里。美国资本家除了以粮食作为交换条件而夺取战略原料外，还要借着财政手段，使印度陷入深渊。但是中国运来的大米，不仅价格非常公平，而且还使印度不致为难，他们接受印度的货币作为代价，并且没有规定任何条件。在这两种交易中，一种交易是为了得到额外的好处，是为了美国战争贩子的利益而牺牲印度的利益的；另一种交易是毫无条件的公平的交易，是对印度特别慷慨的交易。该报说：“中国运来的大米，将会鼓舞印度人民去进一步巩固印中友谊，粉碎美国禁止对华贸易的禁令。”
