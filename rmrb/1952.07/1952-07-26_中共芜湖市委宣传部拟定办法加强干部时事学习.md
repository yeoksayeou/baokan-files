    CPC Wuhu Municipal Committee Propaganda Department Drafts Measures to Strengthen Cadre's Current Affairs Learning
    Editor: Recently, we conducted a check on the reading habits of staff in Wuhu's agencies, organizations, and enterprises. The results showed that the phenomenon of cadres neglecting current affairs and political study is quite serious. According to a survey of eleven units, except for some odd-job workers, none of the agencies have established reading groups or current affairs study organizations. Most people read freely during work breaks. Reading and learning are left to individual initiative, and the vast majority of people either do not read the newspaper at all or only look at the headlines. Very few read the newspaper carefully and regularly. This phenomenon is even more serious in some economic enterprises. For example, 60 percent of all cadres at the Municipal People's Bank do not read the newspaper at all, and only 5 percent read it carefully. A staggering 70 percent of cadres at the Municipal Department Store do not read the newspaper at all. Due to irregular and unsystematic reading and study, many cadres lack due understanding of major political events at home and abroad. Recently, a current affairs quiz was held in some units, and the results were very poor. The overall average score of the participating units was not even passing. Many cadres do not know the specific details of the Korean armistice negotiations, let alone the positions of the enemy and us. Many people are also unaware of the victorious completion of the world's first communist construction project—the Lenin Volga-Don Shipping Canal. This serious neglect of reading also exists in the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee, which has always had a relatively strong political atmosphere.
    The main reason for the neglect of reading by cadres in government departments is the lack of leadership from leading comrades in some units regarding cadres' current affairs and political studies. Some leading comrades simply emphasize the importance of professional work, which further encourages cadres' tendency to neglect politics. Secondly, the purely technical viewpoint of some cadres is still quite serious. Some cadres at the Municipal People's Bank say, "Learning should be applied to practical use. Without skills, it is impossible to do good work. What is the use of current affairs and politics?" Therefore, they use the excuse of being busy with work and not having time to avoid reading the newspaper. Some cadres do read the newspaper, but they do so based on personal interests. The shortage of newspapers compared to the number of people also affects cadres' current affairs learning.
    After investigation and understanding, we have proposed the following improvement measures: First, all units should strengthen leadership over cadres' reading and study. In addition to regularly checking cadres' reading habits through quizzes, seminars, and other methods, attention should also be paid to solving problems such as insufficient newspaper copies. Second, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department will regularly organize Party speakers to give talks on current affairs to cadres of municipal agencies and organizations, and answer difficult questions in learning. Third, out of the two hours of political theory study time each week, set aside four hours to study current affairs, and urge cadres to read newspapers in their spare time. Fourth, for cadres with lower levels of education, a certain amount of time should be allocated for current affairs education in spare-time schools and night schools.

### 中共芜湖市委宣传部拟定办法加强干部时事学习

    中共芜湖市委宣传部拟定办法加强干部时事学习
    编辑同志：最近我们在芜湖市各机关、团体及企业单位的工作人员中，进行了一次关于读报情况的检查。检查结果证明，干部忽视时事和政治学习的现象是相当严重的。从十一个单位的调查情况看来，各机关除某些勤杂人员外，都没有建立读报和时事学习的组织，大部分人都是在工作之暇自由阅读。读报学习陷于自流，绝大多数的人是根本不看报或只看大标题，经常认真读报的人很少。这种现象在一些经济企业单位中更为严重。如市人民银行全体干部中根本不看报的占百分之六十，认真读报的只占百分之五。市百货公司竟有百分之七十的干部根本不看报。由于不经常、不系统地读报学习，很多干部对国内国外重大的政治事件缺乏应有的认识。最近在部分单位举行了一次时事测验，成绩都很不好。参加测验的单位，总平均分数没有一个及格的。很多干部不知道朝鲜停战谈判的具体情况，更不知道敌我双方的主张是怎样的。不少人对于世界第一个共产主义建设工程——列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的胜利完成也不知道。这种忽视读报的严重现象，在一向政治气氛比较浓厚的团市委机关，也是存在的。
    机关干部忽视读报的主要原因，是某些单位的领导同志对干部的时事和政治学习缺乏领导。有些领导同志单纯强调业务重要，这就更加助长了干部忽视政治的倾向。其次，部分干部的单纯技术观点还是相当严重的。市人民银行有些干部说：“学以致用，没有技术做不好工作，时事、政治有什么用。”因此，他们藉口工作忙、没时间，不注意读报。有些干部虽然看报，但是从个人兴趣出发。人多报少的情况，也影响了干部的时事学习。
    经过调查了解，我们提出了如下的改进办法：首先，各单位应加强对干部读报学习的领导。除了通过测验、座谈等方式经常检查干部的读报情况外，并应注意解决报纸份数不够等问题。第二，市委宣传部定期组织党的报告员向全市机关、团体干部讲时事问题，解答学习中的疑难问题。第三，在每周每天两小时的政治理论学习时间中，抽出四小时进行学习时事，并督促干部在业余时间阅读报纸。第四，对于文化水平较低的干部，应在业余学校和夜校中，抽一定时间，进行时事教育。
