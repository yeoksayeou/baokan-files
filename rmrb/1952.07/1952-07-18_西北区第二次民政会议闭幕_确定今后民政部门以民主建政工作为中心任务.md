    The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Department of Civil Affairs convened the Second Northwest Region Civil Affairs Conference from June 22nd to July 4th. The conference discussed and approved the "Report on Civil Affairs Work Issues in the Future" by Wang Ziyi, Minister of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Department of Civil Affairs, and the "Report on Inspecting Civil Affairs Funding Issues" by Deputy Minister Ren Qian. It also focused on discussing democratic governance work and how to assist the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in establishing their livelihoods.
    Starting last year, the People's Governments of various provinces and cities in the Northwest Region have attached greater importance to the work of the People's Representative Conferences. Except for individual pastoral areas in Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang that do not yet have the conditions to convene People's Representative Conferences, all other counties and cities have convened them, and more than 80 counties and cities have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. However, many county and city leaders still do not sufficiently understand that "the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress system are the basic systems of our country," and they do not convene People's Representative Conferences according to the prescribed system. The conference profoundly criticized various incorrect views on the People's Representative Conference and used the typical examples of Tongxin County in Ningxia and Chang'an County in Shaanxi to illustrate that only by holding good People's Representative Conferences can the broad masses of the people be closely united around the People's Governments at all levels, and can the enthusiasm and creativity of the working people be fully utilized to successfully complete all tasks.
    The conference resolved that, in the future, civil affairs departments should take democratic governance work as their central task, and governments at all levels in urban and rural areas should strive to systematically establish and consolidate the democratic system within two or three years. People's Governments at all levels should instruct civil affairs departments at all levels to supervise and assist in holding good People's Representative Conferences at all levels, and resolutely exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress in agricultural areas where land reform has been implemented. Civil affairs departments at all levels must organize cadres to study and research relevant governance documents, vigorously publicize the importance of governance work, especially the work of the People's Representative Conference, to the masses. At the same time, they must select key areas, provide long-term assistance, gain experience, and promote it in a timely manner. The conference also specifically stipulated that the focus of democratic governance work in provinces should be on counties, and the focus of counties should be on townships. If the governance work in counties is not done well, the provinces and special districts should be held responsible, and if the governance work in townships is not done well, the counties and districts should be held responsible. Civil affairs departments at all levels should also be held responsible for inadequate supervision and inspection. If People's Governments at all levels fail to convene People's Representative Conferences according to the prescribed system, in addition to being subject to certain penalties, the People's Governments at higher levels responsible for supervision must also conduct self-criticism.
    Regarding preferential treatment work, the conference resolved that the focus should be on old revolutionary base areas, universally strengthening land cultivation on behalf of others, and at the same time, experimenting with using mutual aid and cooperation methods to solve the production difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. It aims to establish the livelihoods of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers within two to three years, so that their lives reach the level of the average middle peasant.

    西北区第二次民政会议闭幕
    确定今后民政部门以民主建政工作为中心任务
    西北军政委员会民政部于六月二十二日至七月四日召开了西北区第二次民政会议。会议讨论和通过了西北军政委员会民政部部长王子宜“关于今后民政工作问题的报告”和副部长任谦“关于检查民政事业费问题的报告”，并着重讨论了民主建政工作和如何帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属建立家务的问题。
    从去年开始，西北区各省、市人民政府都比较重视了人民代表会议的工作，除青海、宁夏、新疆个别牧区因尚不具备召开人民代表会议的条件外，其余的县、市都曾召开过人民代表会议，并有八十多个县、市代行了人民代表大会的职权。但还有不少县、市的负责人对“人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度”认识不够，不按规定制度召开人民代表会议。会议对各种对人民代表会议的不正确看法进行了深刻批判，并用宁夏同心县和陕西长安县的典型事例说明：只有开好人民代表会议，才能密切地把广大人民群众团结在各级人民政府的周围，也才能充分发挥劳动人民的积极性和创造性，顺利地完成一切工作。
    会议决议：今后民政部门应以民主建政工作为中心任务，城乡各级政权应争取在两三年内把民主制度系统地建立和巩固起来。各级人民政府应责成各级民政部门督促和帮助开好各级人民代表会议，并在实行过土地改革的农业区坚决代行人民代表大会的职权。各级民政部门必须组织干部学习研究有关建政文件，大力向群众宣传建政工作特别是人民代表会议工作的重要性，同时要选择重点，长期帮助工作，取得经验，及时推广。会议还特别规定：民主建政工作省的重点应放在县上，县的重点应放在乡上。县的建政工作搞不好应由省和专署负责，乡的建政工作搞不好应由县和区负责，各级民政部门也应负督促检查不力之责。各级人民政府如不按规定制度召开人民代表会议者除应受到一定处分外，负监督责任的上级人民政府也须进行检讨。
    关于优抚工作，会议决议：重点应放在老区，普遍加强代耕，同时试办以互助合作方法解决革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的生产困难，争取在二、三年内把革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的家务建立起来，使他们的生活达到一般中农的水平。
