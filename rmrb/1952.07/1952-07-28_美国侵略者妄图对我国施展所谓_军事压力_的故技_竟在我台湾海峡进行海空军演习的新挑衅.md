Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: While the US government is stubbornly dragging out the Korean armistice negotiations, its air and naval forces continue to carry out frantic and direct provocations against our country.

Following the repeated intrusions of US air force into our country's northeastern airspace, on July 22nd, a task force of the US Pacific Fleet recklessly conducted a large-scale naval and air "exercise" centered on the Taiwan Strait, along our mainland coast. At the same time, the US Department of the Navy and Admiral Radford, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, issued belligerent and provocative statements. Radford boasted that the exercise showed "the US Navy can go anywhere at any time." The US Navy openly clamored that this was a "powerful warning to China." Commander Susiik, commander of the US task force participating in the "exercise," even more blatantly stated: "If this operation were not an exercise but an attack, there would be full tactical achievements."

It is not difficult for people to see that this new provocative action by the US aggressors, which directly violates our country's territorial waters and airspace sovereignty, is part of the US aggressors' adventurous policy of so-called "military pressure." During the Korean armistice negotiations, the US aggressors stubbornly insisted on their bankrupt "voluntary repatriation" absurd principle in the administrative meetings, while at the same time creating a series of serious provocative incidents one after another outside the meetings, attempting to obtain what they could not obtain at the negotiating table. However, history has proven that the heroic and powerful Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any provocation. No matter what conspiracy of "military pressure" the US aggressors play, there will be no result other than a more tragic failure.

    美国侵略者妄图对我国施展所谓“军事压力”的故技
    竟在我台湾海峡进行海空军演习的新挑衅
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国政府一面蛮横地拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面又以其海空军继续对我国进行疯狂的直接挑衅。
    继美国空军多次侵犯我国东北领空之后，本月二十二日，美国太平洋舰队的一支特遣部队竟肆无忌惮地以我台湾海峡为中心，在我国大陆沿岸进行大规模的海空“演习”。与此同时，美国海军部和美国太平洋舰队总司令雷德福并就此发表好战的挑拨性声明。雷德福吹嘘说：这次演习表明“美国海军可以随时到任何地方去”。美国海军方面则公开叫嚣这是对“中国的有力警告”。参加“演习”的美国特遣舰队司令苏西克甚至更露骨地表示：“如果这次行动不是演习而是进攻，那就会有充分的战术上的成就。”
    人们不难看出：美国侵略者这一直接侵犯我国领海领空主权的新的挑衅行动，是美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”的冒险政策的一部分。美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判期间，一面在行政性会议中顽固坚持其破产了的“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，一面则在会外接二连三地制造了一系列严重的挑衅事件，妄图借此取得它在谈判桌上所不能取得的东西。但是，历史已经证明：英勇而强大的中国人民不是任何挑衅所能吓倒的。美国侵略者不论玩弄什么“军事压力”的阴谋，除了更悲惨的失败以外没有别的结果。
