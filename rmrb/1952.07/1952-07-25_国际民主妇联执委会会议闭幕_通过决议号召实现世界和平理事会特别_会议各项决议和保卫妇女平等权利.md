Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 24th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which opened in Bucharest on the 18th, closed on the evening of the 22nd. The meeting passed resolutions on the reports of various agenda items, and also passed a letter to women around the world. The meeting approved the admission of democratic women's organizations from Indonesia, Chile, Transjordan, and Iraq to the Women's International Democratic Federation, and elected a representative from the German Democratic Women's League to join the Executive Committee. The meeting passed telegrams of tribute to Dolores Ibárruri, Cai Chang, and women's organizations in Iceland and Argentina who did not send representatives to the meeting, and American women fighting for peace. It also sent a telegram to the Brazilian government requesting the release of imprisoned women peace fighters. In her speech at the end of the meeting, Mrs. Gordon emphasized the great significance of the meeting's work and its decisions. She hoped that after the representatives returned to their countries, they would work even harder to mobilize women and all working people to participate in the struggle for peace and for the rights of women and children, and to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in December this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 24th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation continued on the 22nd to discuss the report by Italian representative Santi on the achievements of International Children's Day and further strengthening activities to protect children.

    Chinese representative Shen Yuanhui spoke about the improvement of Chinese children's lives after liberation. He said: China now has more than 50,000 kindergartens, while before liberation there were only 123. The number of primary school students has increased by 6 million in the past six months, and the total number has now reached 43 million. Shen Yuanhui emphasized that American imperialists are threatening China's peaceful development and infringing on the lives of Chinese children. However, we must not give up to anyone the right to a happy life that we have won through arduous struggle. Italian representative Giannarianna Nanni said: Last year, the Italian authorities used various pretexts to close down 80 children's relief homes maintained by democratic groups. One of these relief homes was closed down simply because it hung a flag of peace on the balcony. Representatives from France and Iran also described the poverty of children in France and Iran. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Australia, and Bulgaria also spoke during the discussion of Santi's report. At this point, the discussion of the various agenda items of the Executive Committee came to an end.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 24th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation passed a resolution on the resolutions of the World Peace Council Special Meeting and the tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation, calling on groups participating in the Women's International Democratic Federation in various countries to widely publicize the resolutions of the World Peace Council, and to unite all women to realize these resolutions. The resolution calls for a four-power conference to discuss the German peace treaty issue, and calls on countries to organize support for the struggle to promote the withdrawal of US troops from Japan, the prohibition of the establishment of military bases in Japan, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in the spirit of respecting various international agreements. The resolution pointed out that women in Asian and Pacific countries should be mobilized to prepare for and participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The resolution calls on women's organizations in various countries to strengthen the struggle for the immediate cessation of the Korean War, and calls on women to actively participate in the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress, and points out that the preparatory work for this congress should be carried out under the slogans of striving for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, disarmament, the prohibition of bacteriological weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, improving people's living conditions, and raising the status of children.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 24th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which closed in Bucharest on the 22nd, passed a resolution on the tasks of women's organizations in various countries to defend women's equal rights, saying that in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies, women's civil rights are deprived, and the Women's International Democratic Federation should pay attention to concentrating its efforts on the struggle to win women's equal rights. The resolution points out the paths that women should take in the struggle for rights. These paths are: expanding and consolidating unified action by women; closer cooperation with the World Federation of Trade Unions to strive for women's economic equality; and the establishment of national, regional, and local committees, with the participation of trade unions, various women's groups, and all people concerned about women's equality. These committees should take the lead in proposing laws on women's rights and launching public opinion in support of these laws. The Executive Committee meeting suggested to the Women's International Democratic Federation's organizations in various countries: to expose to women all over the world the actions of the US-British bloc in the UN Economic and Social Council's Commission on the Status of Women to undermine all proposals for actively resolving the issue of women's equal rights.

    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会会议二十二日继续讨论意大利代表桑蒂就国际儿童节的成绩和进一步加强保卫儿童的活动所作的报告。
    中国代表沈元晖发言叙述解放后中国儿童生活改善的情形。他说：中国现已有五万多个幼儿园，而解放前只有一百二十三个。小学生在过去半年内增加了六百万，总数现已达四千三百万。沈元晖强调说：美帝国主义者正在威胁中国的和平发展并侵犯着中国儿童的生命。但是，我们决不能把从艰苦斗争中取得的幸福生活的权利让予任何人。意大利代表季安里安娜·南尼说：去年意大利当局曾以种种藉口查封了八十个由民主团体出钱维持的儿童救济院。其中有一个救济院仅仅因为在阳台上挂了一面和平的旗帜即被查封。法国和伊朗代表也叙述了法国和伊朗儿童的贫困的情况。在讨论桑蒂报告时发言的还有苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、澳大利亚和保加利亚的代表。至此，执委会各项议程的讨论已告结束。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会通过关于世界和平理事会特别会议各项决议和国际民主妇联任务的决议，号召各国参加国际民主妇联的团体广泛宣传世界和平理事会的各项决议，并团结所有妇女来实现这些决议。决议要求举行四国会议讨论对德和约问题，要求各国组织支持为促使美军撤出日本、禁止在日本设立军事基地及以尊重各种国际协议的精神缔结对日和约而作的斗争。决议指出应动员亚洲和太平洋各国的妇女准备和参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。决议号召各国妇女团体加强争取立即停止朝鲜战争的斗争，号召妇女们积极参加世界人民和平大会的筹备工作，并指出这次大会的筹备工作应该在争取缔结五大国和平公约、裁减军备、禁止细菌武器和其他一切大规模毁灭武器、改善人民生活状况和提高儿童地位的口号下进行。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：二十二日在布加勒斯特闭幕的国际民主妇联执行委员会通过关于各国妇女组织保卫妇女平等权利的任务的决议说：在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国，妇女的公民权利被剥夺，国际民主妇联应注意集中力量进行争取妇女平等权利的斗争。决议指出妇女在争取权利的斗争中应走的道路。这些道路就是：扩大与巩固妇女的统一的行动；与世界工会联合会更加密切地合作，以争取妇女在经济上的平等权利；成立全国的、区与地方的委员会，由工会、各种妇女团体以及关心妇女平等问题的一切人士参加。这些委员会应该带头提出关于妇女权利的法律，并且发动舆论支持这些法律。执行委员会会议向国际民主妇联各国组织建议：要在全世界妇女面前揭发美英集团在联合国经社理事会妇女地位委员会内破坏积极解决妇女平等权利问题的一切建议的行为。
