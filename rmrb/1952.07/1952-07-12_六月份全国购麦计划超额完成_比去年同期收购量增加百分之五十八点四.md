Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: The national wheat purchase plan for June was exceeded. According to statistics from the China National Grain Corporation, the national wheat purchase in June completed 137.6% of the monthly plan, an increase of 58.4% compared to the same period last year. With the exception of the Northwest and Southwest, North China, Central South, and East China all exceeded their plans; the East China region exceeded the original plan by 89%.

This year, the national wheat harvest was abundant, and the purchase price offered by the China National Grain Corporation was reasonable. Therefore, wheat was actively put on the market in various regions. Of the wheat put on the market nationwide, about 70% was purchased by the state, and about 30% was purchased by private firms. In mid-June, the state-owned grain company in Shanghai purchased 56.7% of the total transaction volume in the city, while private firms accounted for 43.3%. In June, the state-owned grain company's purchases in thirteen important wheat markets in Shandong Province accounted for 55.7% of the total transaction volume, while private firms accounted for 44.3%. In fourteen markets in Shaanxi Province, the state-owned grain company's purchases accounted for 54.6% of the total transaction volume, while private firms accounted for 45.4%. In fourteen markets in Pingyuan Province, the grain company's purchases accounted for 69.2% of the total transaction volume, while private firms accounted for 30.8%. In other provinces, private firms generally accounted for about 30%.

Under the guidance of the state's price policy, the demands of farmers nationwide to sell commodity wheat have been basically met, following the active purchases by state-owned grain companies, cooperatives, and private firms. Wheat prices in the national market are generally stable and reasonable. According to statistics from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the average market price of wheat in seventy wheat markets across the country was only 0.94% lower than the listed price. In fifteen markets in North China, the market price was 0.44% lower than the listed price; in twenty-six markets in East China, the market price was 0.58% lower than the listed price; and in ten markets in Central South China, the market price was 0.3% higher than the listed price. Only in the Southwest region, due to the state-owned companies' untimely purchases, was the market price of wheat 3% to 9% lower than the listed price. Corrective measures are currently being actively implemented.

    六月份全国购麦计划超额完成
    比去年同期收购量增加百分之五十八点四
    【新华社十一日讯】六月份国家收购小麦计划超额完成。根据中国粮食公司统计，六月份国家收购小麦完成了月计划的百分之一百三十七点六，比去年同期收购量增加了百分之五十八点四。除西北、西南外，华北、中南、华东都超额完成了计划；华东区超额完成了原计划百分之八十九。
    今年全国小麦丰收，又加中国粮食公司收购小麦的牌价合理，因此，各地小麦上市踊跃。全国各地上市小麦，由国家收购的约占百分之七十，由私营厂商收购的约占百分之三十。六月中旬上海市国营粮食公司小麦收购量占该市成交总数百分之五十六点七，私营厂商占百分之四十三点三。六月份山东十三个重要小麦市场国营粮食公司收购量占成交总量百分之五十五点七，私营厂商占百分之四十四点三。陕西省十四个市场国营粮食公司收购量占成交总量百分之五十四点六，私营占百分之四十五点四。平原省十四个市场粮食公司收购量占成交总量百分之六十九点二，私营占百分之三十点八。其他各省一般的私营厂商都占百分之三十上下。
    在国家的价格政策指导下，国营粮食公司、合作社和私营厂商积极收购以后，全国农民出售商品小麦的要求基本上已经满足。全国市场麦价一般都很稳定、合理。根据中央人民政府贸易部统计：全国七十个小麦市场小麦平均市价只低于牌价百分之零点九四。华北十五个市场市价低于牌价百分之零点四四，华东区二十六个市场市价低于牌价百分之零点五八，中南区十个市场市价高于牌价百分之零点三。仅西南区由于国营公司收购不及时，小麦市价低于牌价百分之三到百分之九，目前正在积极纠正中。
