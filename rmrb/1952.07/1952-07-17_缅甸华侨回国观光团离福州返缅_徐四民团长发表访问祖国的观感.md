Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 10th: The Burmese Overseas Chinese Tourist Group, consisting of over thirty members, left Fuzhou City on July 9th and will return to Burma via Guangzhou. The tourist group arrived in Fuzhou on June 16th, and spent most of their twenty-plus days in Fujian visiting the new countryside after the land reform. They witnessed firsthand the free and happy lives of the compatriots liberated from the feudal land system, and saw the beautiful scene of greatly increased crop yields. They unanimously praised the justice and necessity of land reform. They saw the concrete situation of appropriately taking care of overseas Chinese compatriots in the land reform, and greatly admired the serious and responsible spirit of cadres at all levels of the People's Government in implementing policies. After visiting Donglian Township in Hui'an County, which had undergone land reform, group member Cun Chenglong expressed his feelings: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, more than 300 of the 700 people in Donglian Township fled to Burma, the Philippines, and other places to make a living because they had no land to cultivate or to escape the Kuomintang's conscription. Since the land reform, the farmers and poor overseas Chinese families in Donglian Township who originally had no land have been allocated land, and farmers are cultivating their own land, and the yield has increased surprisingly. For example, one mu of sweet potato field can produce more than 10,000 jin, several times more than before liberation. Therefore, farmers can live a life of plenty, which makes me deeply feel the greatness of the meaning of land reform." When the tourist group visited their hometowns, it was the time when early rice was ripe. The yields generally increased by 15% to 20% compared to last year. Many members witnessed the farmers happily harvesting and heard the turned-over farmers talking about plans to purchase new farm tools and new clothes, which made them feel extremely excited.

All members of the tourist group unanimously praised the stability of the social order in Fujian Province now. Some of the members are overseas Chinese compatriots who have never returned to China. The impression of Fujian they got from their parents' words was a "bandit's den." Before this return visit, some members' parents repeatedly told them: "Be careful when you return to Fujian." However, the impression they got after returning to their hometown was completely different. They said: They didn't even see a small thief or beggar in their hometown. Xu Simin, the head of the tourist group, said: Our hometown has truly reached the state of "doors not locked at night, and no one picks up lost articles on the road."

Everywhere the tourist group went, they saw the same scene: young men and women happily working during the day, and going to civil schools or women's literacy classes to learn culture at night. Children all have the opportunity to go to school and study. Bad habits such as superstition, waste, gambling, and drug use have been eradicated. These new atmospheres have left an extremely deep impression on every member.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 11th: Before the Burmese Overseas Chinese Tourist Group left Fujian and returned to Burma, Xu Simin, the head of the group, expressed his impressions on the warm reception given to the group by the people of the motherland and the great achievements of the motherland's peaceful construction:

Since our Burmese Overseas Chinese Tourist Group arrived in the motherland on April 22nd, under the warm reception of the Central People's Government and the People's Governments at all levels, as well as overseas Chinese organizations, we have participated in the "May 1st" International Labor Day celebration in the capital, and successively visited Beijing, Shenyang, Fushun, Dalian, Lushun, Tianjin, the Huai River Basin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fujian, Guangdong and other places, and visited many factories, mines, schools and rural areas, as well as the material exchange conferences in North and East China. Wherever we went, we were deeply moved by the unity and love of peace of the people of the motherland and the great achievements of the motherland's peaceful construction.

Chairman Mao's great call to the people of the whole country to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" has become the practical action of people from all walks of life in the motherland. Workers have launched production emulation campaigns in factories and mines in the posture of masters of the country, and new production records are increasing day by day. Farmers have launched agricultural patriotic production increase campaigns and have achieved a bumper wheat harvest across the country, and early rice in Fujian and other places has also achieved a bumper harvest. Every person in the motherland clearly knows that adding one point of wealth to the motherland is adding one point of strength to defend peace. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the people of the motherland donated 3,710 fighter planes to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and more than 300 million people across the country signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty among the five major powers. All of these strongly demonstrate the great contribution made by the people of the motherland in the cause of defending peace, and overseas Chinese compatriots are proud of this.

Xu Simin said: We can see and hear many miracles everywhere in the motherland: We visited the great Huai River Project with extraordinary joy and admiration. After the completion of this water conservancy project, more than 40 million mu of farmland will be irrigated, and more than 50 million people in the Huai River basin, equivalent to three and a half times the total population of Burma, will be freed from the threat of floods. We also heard that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had been looking forward to for more than 40 years, opened to traffic on July 1st, and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been completed. All of this shows the beautiful prospects of the great motherland and the great achievements of the people of the motherland in peaceful construction under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. We have also seen that learning culture has become a craze among the people in various parts of the motherland. We firmly believe that the state of enslavement, ignorance, hunger, and poverty in old China will never return, and our vast number of overseas Chinese compatriots love their motherland even more.

Xu Simin finally said: Many of us in the Burmese Overseas Chinese Tourist Group are industrialists and businessmen. When we visited the motherland, we paid great attention to the development prospects of private industry and commerce. We are delighted that the motherland has won a great victory in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which have swept away the filth and poison left over from the old society and cleared the obstacles for the motherland's large-scale economic construction. When we visited cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, we saw that legitimate private enterprises have been developed unprecedentedly with the support of the People's Government, the market is very prosperous, old factories are expanding, and many new factories have been established or are under construction. The urban and rural material exchange conferences held in various places have also vigorously promoted the prosperity of industry and commerce. Our view is the same as that of the industrial and commercial circles in the motherland: under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, the development prospects of private industry and commerce are extremely broad.

    缅甸华侨回国观光团离福州返缅
    徐四民团长发表访问祖国的观感
    【新华社福州十日电】缅甸华侨回国观光团一行三十多人，已于七月九日离开福州市，将经过广州返回缅甸。观光团是在上月十六日到达福州的，他们在福建的二十多天中，以大部分时间参观了土地改革后的新农村。他们亲眼看到从封建土地制度下解放出来的同胞正过着自由幸福的生活，看到农田产量大大提高的美好景象，都一致盛赞土地改革的正义性和必要性。他们看到了在土地改革中适当地照顾海外侨胞的具体情况，非常敬佩各级人民政府干部执行政策中的严肃负责精神。团员村成隆参观了经过土地改革的惠安县东莲乡以后，发表感想说：“在国民党反动统治时期，东莲乡七百多人中有三百多人因无地耕种或因逃避国民党的抓丁，逃到缅甸、菲律宾等地谋生。自土地改革后，东莲乡原来没有土地的农民和贫苦华侨家属都分到了土地，农民在自己的田地上耕种，产量提高得惊人，例如一亩蕃薯田就能出产一万多斤，比解放前产量增加了几倍。因此农民们都能过着丰衣足食的生活，这使我深深感到土地改革意义的伟大。”观光团在故乡参观时，适值早稻成熟，各地一般都较去年增产一成半到二成以上，很多团员目睹农民欢欣地收割，听到翻身农民们谈论购置新农具、新衣服的计划，感到莫大的兴奋。
    全体团员对于福建省现在社会秩序的安定一致赞扬。有一部分团员是从未回过国的侨生同胞，他们从父母的言谈中所得到的福建的印象是一个“土匪窟”，有的团员在这次回国观光前，他们的父母还再三嘱咐说：“回到福建后千万要小心。”但是，他们回到故乡以后所得到的印象完全两样。他们说：在故乡连一个小偷、乞丐都没有看到。观光团团长徐四民说：我们的故乡真正已经到达“夜不闭户、路不拾遗”的境地了。
    观光团每到一个地方，都看到同样的景象：青壮男女们白天愉快地劳动，夜晚到民校或妇女识字班去学文化，儿童们都有上学念书的机会。过去的迷信、浪费、赌博、吸毒等坏习气已经根绝了。这些新气象，使每一个团员都留下了极深刻的印象。
    【新华社福州十一日电】缅甸华侨回国观光团团长徐四民在该团离开福建返回缅甸之前，对祖国人民给予该团的热情招待和祖国和平建设的伟大成绩发表观感说：
    我们缅甸华侨回国观光团自四月二十二日抵达祖国后，在中央人民政府和各级人民政府以及华侨团体的热情招待下，曾参加了首都“五一”国际劳动节庆祝典礼，先后游历了北京、沈阳、抚顺、大连、旅顺、天津、淮河流域、南京、上海、杭州、福建、广东等地，参观了很多工厂、矿山、学校和农村以及华北、华东两地的物资交流大会。我们每到一处，都为祖国人民的团结一致热爱和平和祖国和平建设的伟大业绩所深深感动。
    毛主席向全国人民提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，已经变成了祖国各阶层人民的实际行动。工人们以国家主人翁的姿态在工厂矿山中展开了生产竞赛运动，新的生产纪录在与日俱增。农民们由于展开了农业爱国增产运动，已经获得了全国小麦丰收，福建等地早稻也获得丰收。每一个祖国人民都清楚地知道：为祖国增加一分财富，就是增加一分保卫和平的力量。在抗美援朝运动中，祖国人民捐献了三千七百一十架战斗机给中国人民志愿军，全国有三亿多人在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名，这些都强烈地显示出祖国人民在保卫和平的事业上所作的巨大贡献，海外侨胞都以此引为骄傲。
    徐四民说：我们在祖国到处可以看到和听到许多奇迹：我们以异常喜悦和敬佩的心情参观了伟大的治淮工程，这个水利工程完成后将使四千万亩以上的农田得到灌溉，将使相等于缅甸总人口三倍半的淮河流域的五千多万人民免于洪水威胁。我们又听到四川人民盼望四十多年的成渝铁路已于七月一日通车了，荆江分洪工程业已竣工了。所有这一切都显示出伟大祖国的美好远景，显示出祖国人民在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下从事和平建设的巨大成就。我们也看到祖国各地人民学习文化已形成热潮。我们深信：旧中国的奴役、愚昧、饥饿贫困的状态是一去不复返了，我们广大海外侨胞更加热爱着自己的祖国。
    徐四民最后说：我们缅甸华侨回国观光团中间很多是工商业者，我们在祖国参观时，对私营工商业发展前途曾予以极大注意。我们为祖国获得了伟大的“三反”“五反”运动的胜利而欢欣，它已扫清了旧社会遗留下来的污毒，为祖国大规模经济建设扫除了障碍。我们访问上海、天津等城市时，看到了正当的私营企业在人民政府扶助下得到空前发展，市场十分繁荣，老的工厂在扩大，许多新的工厂已建立起来或正在建设中，各地所举行的城乡物资交流大会也有力地促进了工商业的繁荣。我们和祖国的工商界人士的看法一样：在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，私营工商业的发展前程异常广阔。
