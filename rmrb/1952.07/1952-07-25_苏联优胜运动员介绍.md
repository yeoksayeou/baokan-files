(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th) According to TASS, in the wrestling competition of the International Olympic Games held on the 23rd, the first gold medals were won by Soviet Georgian athletes Mekokishvili and Tsimakuri. Honored Master of Sports Mekokishvili is a collective farmer, 185 cm tall, weighing over 115 kg, and is 40 years old this year. For several years, he has maintained the title of Soviet heavyweight freestyle wrestling champion, and many of his wrestling techniques are drawn from Georgian national wrestling methods. Tsimakuri is only 27 years old and is a student at a university in Tbilisi. His wrestling is characterized by rapid attacks and varied methods. When he attacks, he usually knocks his opponent unconscious before achieving a great victory. For example, in the Helsinki competition, he competed against Hodge, one of the best wrestlers in the United States, and defeated Hodge in six minutes.

Romashkova, who won the women's discus throw championship at this Games, is a student at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute. Sports enthusiasts did not know her name much two or three years ago. She was only just listed among the best athletes in the Soviet Union last year. She won the Soviet championship title at the All-Soviet Championships, and her results were better than those of the world record holder Dumbadze. Romashkova's new record at this Games is 51.42 meters, which is also her personal best. Apart from Soviet athletes Romashkova and Dumbadze, no other woman in the world has thrown the discus over 50 meters. This figure has long been regarded as the "maximum limit" for women.

Soviet athlete Chukarin, who won four gold medals in gymnastics, recently graduated from a university in Lvov. He first won the title of absolute champion of the Soviet Union in 1949. Chukarin's performances on various apparatuses are stable, skilled, and freely controlled. Sometimes he can perform six consecutive "somersaults" on the parallel bars, which is a rare achievement.

Soviet jurist Shahinyan won a gold medal in the rings event at this Games. This young and talented athlete performed this event very skillfully, scoring 9.95 points. He is the highest-scoring athlete in all the gymnastics competitions at the Games.

    苏联优胜运动员介绍
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在二十三日举行的国际奥林匹克运动会角力比赛中，首先获得金质奖章的是苏联格鲁吉亚共和国的选手麦科基施维里和齐马库里。功勋体育家麦科基施维里是一位集体农民，高一百八十五公分，重量超过一百一十五公斤，今年四十岁。几年来他一直保持着苏联重量级自由式角力冠军的称号，他的角力技巧很多是从格鲁吉亚民族角力的方法中吸取来的。齐马库里只有二十七岁，是第比利斯一所高等学校的学生。他的角力的特点是：进攻迅速，办法繁多。他进攻时一般总是把对手打晕过去，然后大获全胜。例如，在这次赫尔辛基的比赛中，他和美国一个最好的角力家霍治比赛，在六分钟就把霍治打倒了。
    在这次运动会上荣获女子掷铁饼冠军的罗马什柯娃，是莫斯科教育学院的学生，两三年前，体育爱好者们还不大知道她的名字。她是刚刚在去年才列名于苏联最优秀的体育家当中的。她在全苏锦标赛中曾取得苏联冠军的称号，她的成绩比起世界纪录保持者杜姆巴柴（前译顿巴泽）还要优异。罗马什柯娃在这次运动会上的新纪录是五十一点四二公尺，也是她个人的最高纪录。除了苏联选手罗马什柯娃和杜姆巴柴之外，全世界再没有别一个妇女掷铁饼的成绩超过五十公尺，这个数字长期以来都被看作是妇女的“最高限度”。
    在机巧运动竞赛中取得四枚金质奖章的苏联运动员朱卡林，是最近才从罗夫一所高等学校毕业的学生。他在一九四九年第一次取得苏联绝对冠军的称号。朱卡林的各种器械操表演都稳定熟练，操纵自如。有时他能够在双杠上接连表演六次“腾跃”，这是很难得的成绩。
    苏联法学家沙金扬在这次运动会上以吊环表演获得一枚金质奖章。这位年轻的天才运动家非常熟练地作这项表演，共得九点九五分。他是运动会上全部机巧运动比赛中得分最多的人。
