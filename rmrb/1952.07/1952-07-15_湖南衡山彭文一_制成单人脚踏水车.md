Peng Wanyi from Hengshan, Hunan
Manufactures a Single-Person Treadle Waterwheel

Peng Wanyi, a member of the Zhou Renliu Mutual Aid Team in Baisha Township, Hengshan County, Hunan, with the strong support of the People's Government and the mutual aid team, has manufactured a new type of single-person treadle waterwheel. One person using this waterwheel can achieve the efficiency of three people using the old-fashioned waterwheel. This waterwheel can overcome or alleviate the difficulties of labor shortage during droughts.

The single-person treadle waterwheel is based on the flywheel effect of the old-fashioned cotton gin and the gear principle of the noodle press. The frame is composed of three supports. The left and middle supports hold the waterwheel arch, the right side supports the flywheel, and then the roller center, gears, pedals and other components are installed. Using the pedal to drive the flywheel, and the flywheel to drive the gears, the gears on the waterwheel arch also move, driving the dragon bone waterwheel blades, so the water is lifted.

After testing, this waterwheel has the following advantages: (1) Saving labor. The old-fashioned dragon bone waterwheel requires four people to operate, while the new single-person treadle waterwheel only requires one and a half or two laborers. This can save two and a half or two laborers. (2) Saving time and improving efficiency. The old-fashioned dragon bone waterwheel with four people operating pumps approximately 62.3 cubic meters of water per hour, irrigating 1.81 mu of land per hour; the new single-person treadle waterwheel with two people operating pumps 74.17 cubic meters of water per hour, irrigating 2.22 mu of land per hour. This is 0.41 mu more land irrigated per hour than the old-fashioned waterwheel. (3) The operating technology is simple and easy for farmers to master. The frame is small and convenient to use. Although the new single-person treadle waterwheel costs twice as much as the old-fashioned waterwheel, it is more durable than the old-fashioned waterwheel.

### 湖南衡山彭文一  制成单人脚踏水车

    湖南衡山彭文一
    制成单人脚踏水车
    湖南衡山县白沙乡周仁六互助组组员彭文一在人民政府和互助组的有力支持下，制成新式单人脚踏水车。一个人用这种水车车水，顶得上三个人用旧式水车车水的效率。这种水车可以克服或减轻天旱时缺少人力的困难。
    单人脚踏水车是根据旧式轧花机的飞轮作用和压面机的齿轮原理制成的。车架由三个架子凑成。左边和中间托车弓，右边托飞轮，再装上滚心、齿轮、踏板等机件。利用踏板带动飞轮，利用飞轮带动齿轮，车弓上的齿轮也就跟着动起来，带动了龙骨车叶，于是水就被车上来了。
    这种水车经过试验，有如下几点好处：（一）节省劳动力。旧式龙骨水车需要四个人才能车水，新式单人脚踏水车只需要一个半劳动力或两个劳动力。这就能节省两个半或两个劳动力。（二）节省时间，提高效率。旧式龙骨水车四人车水，每一小时出水量约为六十二点三立方公尺，每小时灌田一点八一亩；新式单人脚踏水车两人车水，每小时出水量为七十四点一七立方公尺，每小时灌田二点二二亩。比旧式水车每小时可多灌田零点四一亩。（三）使用技术简单，易为农民熟悉。车架很小，使用时很方便。新式单人脚踏水车价值虽比旧式水车高两倍，但比旧式水车经久耐用。
