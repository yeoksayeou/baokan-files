    Hurry Up and Catch Pink Bollworms
    Comrade Editor: The pink bollworm is a major pest of cotton. In Shandong, cotton suffers from pink bollworm damage every year, resulting in losses of more than 10 percent. Last year in Zhejiang, the infestation rate of green bolls (cotton bolls are green when they first appear, hence the name green bolls) in August was over 65 percent, and in September it reached over 90 percent. Half of the affected cotton plants suffered from yellow flowers, stiff petals, and rotten bolls, resulting in significant losses.
    Currently, in the Xiaoshan area of Zhejiang, 20% of the early-maturing upland cotton is flowering. Field inspections reveal that half of these newly opened cotton bolls contain pink bollworm larvae. The affected flowers cannot fully open. The pink bollworm larvae are hiding in the brown clumps in the center of the flower, and can be easily removed with tweezers and captured. Every day from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, when the cotton is in full bloom or semi-bloom, is suitable for catching pink bollworms. From the initial flowering to the peak flowering period is the best time to capture pink bollworm larvae, so seize the opportunity to catch them. If there are many green bolls in the field, and the pink bollworm has developed into its second or third generation, the density of the worms will increase, and it will be more difficult to catch them. Capturing pink bollworms is a crucial link in ensuring a bountiful cotton harvest. I hope that cotton farmers in all regions will take timely and swift action to capture them.

### 赶快捕捉红铃虫

    赶快捕捉红铃虫
    编辑同志：红铃虫是棉花的大害虫。山东的棉花，每年受红铃虫害，损失达百分之十以上；去年浙江的棉花，八月份青铃（棉铃初生时呈青色，所以叫青铃）被害率在百分之六十五以上，九月份达百分之九十以上。受害的棉花，半数是黄花、僵瓣、烂铃，损失很大。
    现在浙江萧山地区的早熟洋棉，已有二成开花。经田间检查，这些初开的花絮，半数有红铃虫幼虫。被害的花不能完全放开。红铃虫的幼虫都躲在花心褐堆块里，可用镊子拨取，捕捉很容易。每日上午八时到下午四时，棉花正开或半开的时候，都适于捕捉红铃虫。从初开花到盛开花期，正是捕捉红铃虫幼虫的适期，要抓紧时机捕捉。如果田间青铃多了，红铃虫发生了二三代，虫的密度增大，那时再来捉，就不容易了。捕捉红铃虫是保证棉花丰产的重要环节，希望各地棉农们及时迅速地进行捕捉。
