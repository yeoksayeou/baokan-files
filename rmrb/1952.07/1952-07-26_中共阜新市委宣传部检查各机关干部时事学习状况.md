    The CCP Fuxin Municipal Committee Propaganda Department Inspects the Status of Current Affairs Learning by Cadres in Various Agencies

    Editor: Recently, we focused on inspecting the newspaper reading situation of staff members in the Xinqiu Mine's agencies, and found that the phenomenon of most cadres neglecting current affairs and political study is quite serious. The vast majority of cadres usually do not pay attention to reading newspapers. Of the 69 cadres in the Mining Department, only 4 regularly read the Northeast Daily, nearly half of them do not read newspapers at all, and the rest only occasionally glance at the headlines on the front page. All 28 people in the Surveying and Mapping Section have reading ability, but only two of them regularly read newspapers. On May 31st, we conducted a current affairs test among 152 cadres in the mine, and only 16 people passed. The vast majority of cadres lack the necessary understanding of important current events at home and abroad, and 48 people even handed in blank papers.

    Why does this phenomenon occur? Many people emphasize that "work is busy, and there is no time to read newspapers." However, the inspection results prove that these cadres neglect current affairs and political study mainly because they have a purely technical viewpoint. Zheng Xijiu of the Technical Security Section examined himself, saying: "I just put my energy into technology, and I always think about reading technical books every day, and I don't pay attention to newspapers." Some people in the Mining Department said: "Anyway, it's fine if the work is done well, it doesn't matter whether you read newspapers or not." The cadres at the pithead generally believe that "how can you complete the task if you only read newspapers?" They put current affairs and political study in opposition to work, confining themselves to a small circle of purely technical viewpoints. More importantly, the Xinqiu Mine Party General Branch has always believed that "staff members have reading ability and can study on their own," so it has abandoned inspection and leadership, resulting in a serious phenomenon of staff members neglecting politics.

    In order to correct the above-mentioned phenomenon and strengthen the current affairs and political study of economic workers, the Party General Branch of the mine stipulates: 1. Conduct irregular tests, and make a summary report of study to all cadres once a month, commend those who study well, and criticize those who neglect study, to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm for study; 2. Stipulate two mornings a week for studying newspapers; 3. Leaders of each department who study should form a leading core to strengthen specific leadership over the current affairs and political study of cadres.

    We have long neglected the inspection and leadership of this work, which is something we should examine ourselves on. We have decided to conduct a general inspection of the newspaper reading situation of staff members in all subordinate departments, and plan to study effective improvement methods based on the inspection situation.

### 中共阜新市委宣传部检查各机关干部时事学习状况

    中共阜新市委宣传部检查各机关干部时事学习状况
    编辑同志：最近我们重点检查了新邱矿机关工作人员的读报情况，发现大部分干部忽视时事和政治学习的现象是相当严重的。绝大部分干部平时不注意读报。矿井科六十九名干部，只有四人常看东北日报，近半数的人根本不看报纸，其余的人只是偶尔看一看头版上的大标题。测绘股二十八人都有阅读能力，但只有两个人经常看报。五月三十一日，我们在该矿一百五十二名干部中举行了一次时事测验，结果仅有十六人及格，绝大多数的干部对目前国内国外重要时事问题缺乏应有的认识，有四十八人甚至交了白卷。
    为什么会产生这种现象呢？很多人都强调“工作忙，没有时间看报”。但检查结果证明，这些干部忽视时事和政治学习，主要是由于他们有单纯技术观点。技术保安科郑锡九检讨说：“我就是往技术上用劲，每天总想法看技术书籍，对报纸是不重视的。”矿井科有人说：“反正把工作做好了就行，看报不看报没关系。”坑口干部普遍地认为“怎样看报，完不成任务也不行”。他们把时事、政治学习和工作对立起来，把自己局限于单纯技术观点的小圈子里。更重要的是新邱矿党总支一直认为“工作人员有阅读能力，可以自修”，因此放弃了检查和领导，造成了工作人员忽视政治的严重现象。
    为了纠正上述现象，加强经济工作人员的时事和政治学习，该矿党总支规定：一、举行不定期的测验，每月向全体干部作一次学习总结报告，对学习好的给以表扬，对忽视学习的给以批评，以启发大家的学习热情；二、每星期规定两天早晨学习报纸；三、由各部门领导学习的人，组成领导核心，加强对干部时事、政治学习的具体领导。
    我们长期忽视对这一工作的检查和领导，是应该检讨的。我们已决定对所属各部门工作人员读报情况，进行普遍的检查，并拟根据检查情况研究出有效的改进办法。
