Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The United States and Britain have not sent official delegations to the 18th International Red Cross Conference, which opened in Toronto, Canada, on July 26th. Although approximately seventy countries' governments and Red Cross organizations, including those of the Soviet Union and China, have sent official delegations, the governments of the United States and Britain have only sent so-called "observer delegations" to Toronto.

People may be surprised by this peculiar phenomenon, but the U.S. and British governments have ulterior motives for doing so. For example, a United Press Washington dispatch on July 18 revealed: The Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries will send delegations to the meeting, "causing anxiety among officials here (Washington)." "U.S. officials admit that the United States and its allies face serious 'obstacles' in the upcoming conference." "They feel the Toronto conference may be one of the most important crises in the Cold War propaganda struggle." As can be seen from the reports of the U.S. and British news agencies, the U.S. government has not sent an official delegation to the conference because it is very afraid that the countless atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Korea will be condemned at the meeting. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Toronto on July 24, "A conference spokesman said that the U.S. and British decision means that the accusations that the communists may raise will not be answered." In other words, the U.S. government is attempting to use this method to escape the condemnation of world public opinion and is pulling Britain in as an accomplice in its behind-the-scenes command.

It would be wrong to think that the U.S. government is truly a hands-off "observer." The U.S. government has another conspiracy in doing so. While outwardly proclaiming that it will not engage in "political" activities at this Red Cross Conference, it is actually engaging in intense obstruction and sabotage activities as a behind-the-scenes commander. According to the United Press, the U.S. has a so-called mission "to prevent the conference from engaging in propaganda disputes." In reality, they are attempting to use every means to manipulate the conference, obstruct discussions on important issues related to maintaining humanitarianism, and obstruct discussions on U.S. atrocities such as the massacre of Korean civilians, germ warfare, and the abuse and forced detention of prisoners of war. Not only that, but the United States is also directing its servants behind the scenes to disrupt the conference. The U.S. representative manipulated its "voting machine" and forced the International Red Cross Standing Committee to pass a resolution on the 24th allowing the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan, who only represent a gang of desperadoes, to participate in the conference. At the Red Cross Societies Executive Committee meeting held on the same day, the Cuban representative, who was not a member of the Executive Committee, disrupted the meeting order under the instigation of the United States, grabbed the microphone, and shouted in Spanish against the participation of the Chinese Red Cross representative in the meeting. According to a United Press dispatch from Toronto on July 24, "Conference observers believe that the issue of Communist China's participation in the debate and voting may be raised in future meetings." Obviously, the U.S. government is also plotting to use various despicable and shameless means to create various incidents to disrupt the conference in future meetings.

Observers here point out that the U.S. government's tricks of daring not to send an official delegation to the Toronto conference, but sending a so-called "observer delegation" to engage in behind-the-scenes sabotage activities, will certainly not deceive the discerning people of the world. World public opinion must be seriously vigilant about the U.S. representative's conspiracy to manipulate and sabotage the International Red Cross Conference being held in Toronto. The International Red Cross Conference should become a conference for upholding humanitarian principles and condemning the monstrous crimes of the U.S. military in massacring Korean civilians, conducting germ warfare, and abusing Chinese and Korean prisoners of war.

### 美国在幕后把持和破坏国际红十字大会  企图逃避世界舆论谴责侵朝美军的暴行

    美国在幕后把持和破坏国际红十字大会
    企图逃避世界舆论谴责侵朝美军的暴行
    【新华社二十八日讯】七月二十六日在加拿大多伦多开幕的第十八届国际红十字大会中，美国和英国都没有派正式的代表团参加。虽然约有七十个国家的政府和红十字会组织，包括苏联、中国的政府和红十字会都已派遣了正式代表团，但美国和英国的政府都只派了一个所谓“观察员代表团”前往多伦多。
    人们会对这种奇特的现象感到诧异，但是，美英政府这样做，是有它不可告人的阴谋。例如，合众社华盛顿十八日电就透露：苏联、中国和各人民民主国家均将派遣代表团参加会议，“使此间（华盛顿）官员感到忧虑”。“美国官员承认，美国及盟国在即将举行的会议中面临严重的‘障碍’。”“他们觉得多伦多会议可能就是冷战宣传斗争中最重要的危机之一。”从美、英通讯社的报道中可以看出：美国政府所以没有派遣正式代表团参加大会，是因为它十分害怕美国军队在朝鲜干出的罄竹难书的暴行，会在会上受到谴责。据法新社多伦多二十四日电称：“大会发言人说：美、英这种决定，意味着共产党可能提出的指责，将得不到答复。”换句话说，也就是美国政府企图用这种方法来逃避世界舆论的指责，并且拉住英国来做它的幕后指挥的帮凶。
    如果以为美国政府真是那样袖手旁观的“观察员”，那就错了。美国政府这样做，还有另一方面的阴谋。它表面上扬言它在这次红十字大会上不进行“政治性”活动，但在实际上，它却以幕后指挥者的资格，进行紧张的阻挠和破坏活动。据合众社说：美国在会议中有一项所谓“努力阻止会议进行宣传争吵”的任务。实际上，它们是企图用一切手段来操纵大会，阻挠大会讨论有关当前维护人道主义的重大问题，阻挠大会讨论美国屠杀朝鲜和平居民、进行细菌战、虐杀和强迫扣留战俘等暴行。不仅如此，美国还在幕后指挥它的仆从来破坏大会。美国代表操纵它的“投票机器”，强使国际红十字常设委员会在二十四日通过容许只代表一伙亡命之徒的台湾国民党残余分子参加大会。在同日举行的红十字会协会执行委员会上，并非执行委员会会员的古巴代表在美国的指使下，竟破坏会议秩序，抓住扩音器，用西班牙话大叫反对我国红十字会代表参加会议。据合众社多伦多二十四日电透露：“大会观察家认为：共产党中国参加辩论与投票的问题，可能在以后的会议中被提出来”。很明显，美国政府还阴谋在以后的会议中用种种卑鄙无耻的手段来制造破坏大会的各种事件。
    此间观察家指出：美国政府不敢派遣正式代表团参加多伦多会议，而派遣所谓“观察员代表团”在幕后进行破坏活动的鬼蜮伎俩，决然欺骗不了全世界眼睛雪亮的人民。世界舆论必须严重警惕美国代表把持和破坏刻在多伦多举行的国际红十字大会的阴谋。国际红十字大会应当成为维护人道原则、谴责美国军队屠杀朝鲜和平居民、进行细菌战、虐杀中朝战俘的滔天罪行的大会。
