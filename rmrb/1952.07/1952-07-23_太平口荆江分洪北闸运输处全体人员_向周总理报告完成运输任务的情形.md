To Premier Zhou:

We—all the sailors, junk workers, and working cadres of the Taipingkou Jingjiang Diversion North (Inflow) Sluice Transportation Office, hereby report to you on our achievements on the transportation materials front over the past two months:

From March 24th to May 24th, we transported over 448,000 tons of major engineering materials (yellow sand, gravel, and boulders) from Caishizhou, Dongshi, Yidu, Nanjinguan, and Letianxi areas to the Taipingkou construction site, exceeding and completing the task assigned to us by the General Headquarters ahead of schedule. The transportation task we completed averaged approximately one million ton-kilometers per day. This is equivalent to transporting one ton of materials and traveling around the equator twenty-four times a day, or circling the equator once every hour.

In the course of our work, the worker comrades displayed a high degree of patriotism and creativity, overcame many difficulties, and many heroic deeds emerged. We widely used the advanced experience of the Soviet "one-train towing method," which doubled the towing capacity of the tugboats. Sailors and boatmen displayed creativity and initiative, breaking with the conservative thinking that the Jingjiang River could not be navigated at night and that navigation was impossible without a pilot. This created favorable conditions for completing the task on schedule.

These victorious results should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the strong support of Party committees and governments at all levels and the people of the whole country. We are not satisfied with the achievements we have made. We pledge and are determined to put forth even greater efforts in the future construction of the motherland and strive for the rapid arrival of a bright future for the motherland!

With the highest respect,
The Entire Staff of the Taipingkou Jingjiang Diversion North (Inflow) Sluice Transportation Office (Sailors, Boatmen, and Working Cadres)

    太平口荆江分洪北闸运输处全体人员
    向周总理报告完成运输任务的情形
    周总理：我们——太平口荆江分洪北（进洪）闸运输处全体海员、帆船工人和工作干部，谨向您报告我们两个月来在运输器材战线上的成绩：
    从三月二十四日到五月二十四日，我们从彩石洲、董市、宜都、南津关以及乐天溪等地区，运输了四十四万八千多吨工程主要材料（黄砂、砾石和蛮石）到太平口工地，超额并提前完成了总指挥部给我们的任务。我们所完成的运输任务，平均每天约为一百万延吨公里。这相当于运输一吨物资，每天环绕赤道走二十四周，即每小时绕赤道一转。
    在工作过程中，工人同志发挥了高度的爱国主义精神和创造性，克服了很多困难，出现了不少的英勇事迹。我们广泛地使用了苏联“一列拖带法”的先进经验，使拖轮的拖载量提高了一倍。海员及船工发挥了创造性和积极性，打破了荆江不能夜航和没有引水不能开航的保守思想。这就为如期完成任务创造了有力的条件。
    这些胜利的成果，应该归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，以及各级党委、政府和全国人民大力的支援。我们并不满足于已得的成绩，我们向您提出保证和决心：我们坚决要在今后祖国的建设事业中，拿出更大的努力，为争取祖国美好的将来迅速到来而奋斗！此致崇高的敬礼太平口荆江分洪北（进洪）闸运输处全体海员、船工、工作干部
