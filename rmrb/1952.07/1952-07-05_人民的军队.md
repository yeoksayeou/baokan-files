    The People's Army
    By Dai Yi, England
    What kind of army is this? What is so special about it? In the past, a soldier was just a vagrant or a bandit. Now, joining the army is an honor. Why is it so different? Because it comes from the people, because it is part of the people. There is no separation between the army and the people; they are one! Is this a general? But his clothing is as simple as a farmer's, cotton uniform, no special markings, no belt, no medals, everything is so plain, he lives like a soldier. He stands in a waist-deep mud ditch, using his clothes as a mud bucket, fighting the floods, engaging in constructive labor, preventing floods from recurring, and saving the lives of hundreds of millions of people. This is a new army, a construction army! Other armies engage in destruction, but this army is completely different. This army saves lives, this army does not accept any gifts from the peasants, and pays compensation for anything it uses. It treats the people like family, farming together in the fields, building together, singing together. This is the people's army. Only towards the landlord exploiting class, the imperialist running dogs, and the Kuomintang reactionaries is it filled with hatred. It hates those who want to stifle the new China and restore the old China, it hates those who want to bring hunger, disease, poverty, and death to the people. It liberated the people, gave the land and factories to the people, gave them freedom, gave them hope. It and the people together are building a new Great Wall, so that the disasters of the old era will be forever extinct. Under its protection, people build for the future, people can farm in peace. Nature rewards their labor with happiness, the earth laughs, and songs of harvest fly everywhere. The people sing in the fields, sing on the threshing grounds, and the grains shine in the sun. The army and the people labor and sing together, because this army is the people's army. It comes from the people, it is part of the people, they are united together, they are one.

    人民的军队
    英国　戴伊
    这是什么样的军队？它有什么特别？从前，一个兵就是一个流浪汉，或者一个土匪。现在，参军是光荣。为什么这样不同？因为，它从人民中来，因为，它是人民的一部分，军队和人民之间没有隔阂，他们是一个整体！这是一位将军吗？可是他的服装朴素得和农民的一样，棉布军装，没有特殊的标记，没有武装带，没有勋章，一切是那样朴素，他生活得跟士兵一样。他站在齐腰的泥沟里，用他的衣服当戽泥斗，向江湖作战，进行着建设性的劳动，不让洪水再成灾，拯救亿万人的生命。这是一支新的军队，建设的军队！别的军队从事破坏，这支军队完全不同。这支军队拯救生命，这支军队不接受农民的任何馈赠，使用了什么东西，付钱补偿。对人民像一家人，一起在地里耕种，一起建筑，一起歌唱，这是人民的军队。只有对地主剥削阶级，对帝国主义走狗，对国民党反动派，它才充满了仇恨心。它仇恨那些想窒息新中国恢复旧中国的人，它仇恨那些想把饥饿，疫病，贫穷，死亡，带给人民的人。它解放了人民，把土地，工厂给了人民，把自由给他们，把希望给他们。它和人民一起建筑一座新的长城，使旧时代的灾难永远绝迹。在它的保护下，人们为未来而建设，人们能够平安地耕地。大自然把幸福报答他们的劳动，大地欢笑，丰收的歌声到处飞扬。人民在地里歌唱，在打谷场上歌唱，谷粒在阳光里闪光。军队和人民一起劳动歌唱，因为这军队是人民的军队。它从人民中来，它是人民的一部分，他们团结在一起，他们是一个整体。一九五二年六月十七日（袁水拍译）〔注〕作者是英国牛津大学国际问题讲师。最近他和坎特伯雷教长约翰逊一同来到中国参观访问。
