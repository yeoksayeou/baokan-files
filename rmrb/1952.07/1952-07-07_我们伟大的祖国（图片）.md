Our Great Motherland
Today is the 15th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people achieved today's victory after the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The Chinese people's army has grown stronger in long-term battles and has become a strong force for defending the motherland and defending peace. This is a scene of the soldiers of the Chinese People's Army – the Eighth Route Army – fighting the enemy near the Great Wall during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    我们伟大的祖国
    今天是中国人民抗日战争十五周年纪念日。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过了抗日战争和解放战争，才取得了今天的胜利。中国人民的军队在长期战斗中壮大起来，已成为保卫祖国、保卫和平的坚强力量。这是抗日战争时期，中国人民军队——八路军的战士们在长城一带和敌人进行战斗的场面。
