    About the Volga-Don Canal
    (Abstract of a speech given on June 26th at the Soviet Great Communist Construction Projects Report Meeting held by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries)
    Soviet Water Conservancy Expert Shashkov
    On May 31, 1952, a historically significant event occurred: the two great rivers of Russia, the Volga and the Don, were linked together. The dream of generations of Russian people has been realized. The builders of the Volga-Don Canal gloriously completed the task set by the Soviet Communist Party and the government to finish the Volga-Don Canal ahead of schedule. I believe that hundreds of millions of Chinese people and the people of various People's Democratic countries will share the joy of the Soviet people, and so will progressive humanity all over the world.
    The Chinese people are fighting against natural disasters: building dikes, combating floods and droughts; digging canals to make nature submit to mankind. Therefore, the experience of building the Volga-Don Canal can not only be used by the Soviet people in carrying out other communist constructions, but it may also be used by the Chinese people and the people of the People's Democratic countries in their struggle with nature.
    In ancient times, Russian merchants frequently traded with the affluent Black Sea coastal countries. The main channel for trade between countries at that time was waterways. To get from the Volga River to the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea by water, it was necessary to cross the watershed between the Volga and the Don. At that time, in order to get from the Volga River to the Black Sea coast, merchants took their goods on small, shallow boats along the Volga River, and then along the Kamyshin River, a tributary of the Volga River. At the end of the waterway, merchants had to drag their boats ashore, then put them on rollers and drag them to the Ilovlya River, a tributary of the Don. Later, when Russia was consolidated as a nation-state, the question of a waterway between the Volga and the Don was raised in the era of Peter the Great. Because Peter the Great was concerned about trade with the Mediterranean countries, he decided to build a navigable canal. Due to the then external political situation (the war with Sweden lasted for twenty-one years), the construction work did not proceed smoothly and was abandoned halfway. Advanced Russian engineers during the Tsarist era repeatedly mentioned this issue. From the time of Peter the Great until 1911, nearly thirty plans for connecting the Volga and the Don were submitted to the Tsarist government for review. However, these plans were buried in the archives of the Tsarist administrative organs under various pretexts and never saw the light of day. This was due to the Tsarist government officials' indifference to solving the major problem of how to utilize the abundant Russian rivers, and also because Tsarist Russia did not have the strength to build such a canal.
    However, when the October Revolution had just won and the civil war was still going on fiercely, Lenin raised the issue of accelerating the planning work related to the construction of the Volga-Don Canal at a meeting of the People's Committee in 1918. Lenin attached great importance to this canal project, believing that it was a "powerful transportation lever" that could reverse the economy of the backward regions of southeastern Russia. After conducting a lot of research and preparation work to survey the route of the canal, the design plan for the construction of the canal began. The design work was completed in 1929. The task was to change nature, and to solve the problems of navigation, power, irrigation, and other individual but important issues together. Construction work had already begun before World War II. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, the construction of the canal was suspended. After the war, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a resolution in 1947 to resume the construction of the Volga-Don Canal. Then, on December 28, 1950, the Soviet government issued a decision to complete the Volga-Don Canal and related water conservancy projects two years ahead of schedule, setting a broader task for the project.
    The content of this project includes the 101-kilometer-long Volga-Don navigable canal, the Tsimlyansk Reservoir with a water storage capacity of 12.6 billion cubic meters, the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station with a power generation capacity of 160,000 kilowatts, and an irrigation system for irrigating and supplying water to 2.75 million hectares of land. It can solve transportation, power, and irrigation problems simultaneously.
    Now, some of the technical features and construction work of the main parts of the Volga-Don Canal are briefly described as follows:
    1. The Volga-Don navigable canal is a diverse hydraulic engineering project. In addition to thirteen locks and three pumping stations, there are also spillways, stop gates for repairs, docks, berths, and other hydraulic engineering structures. Three reservoirs with a total water storage capacity of 400 million cubic meters are built along the canal's navigation line.
    The navigation line of the navigable canal runs from Kalach to Stalingrad, crossing three rivers on the prairie: the Karpovka River, the Tsylyavyanka River, and the Sharpa River. Dams have been built on these rivers to form a series of artificial reservoirs. These reservoirs are connected to each other by wide, lock-equipped canals.
    The watershed between the Volga and the Don is 88 meters higher than the surface of the Volga River near the town of Krasnoarmeysk and 44 meters higher than the surface of the Don River. To allow the river water to cross the watershed, thirteen locks and three pumping stations must be built. Each pumping station can pump 45 cubic meters of water per second. When the three pumping stations pump water from the Don at the same time, they can drain the Don dry.
    2. The Tsimlyansk Reservoir (i.e., the Tsimlyansk Sea) is also a major part of the hydraulic engineering project. It is formed by building a 12.75-kilometer-long dam on the Don River channel to block the Don River's water. The reservoir is 180 kilometers long and about 30 kilometers wide. The regulating water volume is 12.6 billion cubic meters. When the wind is strong, the water waves in the reservoir are as high as three meters.
    In addition to supplying the water needed for the navigable canal, the "Tsimlyansk Sea" also irrigates the arid areas of the Stalingrad and Rostov regions, supplies water to these areas, and ensures the operation of the hydroelectric power station. In addition, it also continuously releases water to raise the water level of the Don River from Tsimlyansk to Rostov.
    The Tsimlyansk Reservoir is the largest artificial reservoir in the world. The amount of water evaporated from its surface in a year is equal to the total water storage capacity of the Moscow Sea. The pressure of its entire water volume is supported by the dam. The dam was built on sandy soil, which is the first time in the history of world hydraulic construction; moreover, the 12.8-kilometer-long dam body is also made of sandy soil. Soviet hydraulic technicians have solved the problem of building dams on soft soil, especially on sandy soil, which is a very difficult technical problem. According to the opinions that have always existed among foreign hydraulic engineers, and which are still retained to this day, especially the opinions of American hydraulic engineers, it is only possible to build a dam under high pressure if the dam body is built on rock. However, Soviet scientific and technological thought has surpassed foreign countries, and has far exceeded them in solving many technical problems.
    The earthwork part of the dam was completed by the "alluvial method" (i.e., hydraulic mechanization). The world's hydraulic construction projects have never used such a large scale and such a high speed in terms of machine-controlled hydraulics as the builders of the Volga-Don navigable canal. Dozens of dredgers sucked sand and water from the riverbed, and the mixture of water and soil, called "sediment," flowed along a pipeline with a diameter of one meter to the construction site of the dam, gradually forming the dam body. A total of 26 million cubic meters of soil was sent by alluvial method in the construction of the dam. Such a machine can alluviate 1.5 million to 2.6 million cubic meters of soil per year. Therefore, it only takes eight to ten such machines to complete the construction of a dam with a volume of 26 million cubic meters.
    3. Hydroelectric Power Station - The Soviet Council of Ministers decided to build a hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 160,000 kilowatts on the Tsimlyansk dam. The hydroelectric power station can fully supply electricity to the agricultural irrigation area and the industrial area, and at the same time, it can also supply electricity to the pumping station that sends water from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir to the navigable canal.
    The Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station has a total of four generators, each with a power generation capacity of 40,000 kilowatts.
    4. Underground Canal of the Don Main Canal. In excavating the irrigation system, Soviet builders solved a special problem. There is a highland between the Don River and the Sal River, and the Don Main Canal must pass through this highland to connect the Tsimlyansk Reservoir and the Upper Sal Canal. If the open canal method is used, about 60 million cubic meters of soil will have to be excavated, but Soviet builders reduced the amount of excavation many times by building a 6-kilometer-long underground canal. Although the local soil conditions were very poor, with loose sand layers that were not strong, the construction work went smoothly thanks to the experience accumulated by Soviet subway builders. The entire process of building the underground canal was mechanized.
    5. In terms of earthwork, the amount of soil excavated from the Volga-Don Canal is 152.1 million cubic meters. Now compare this number with the amount of soil excavated from similar projects in the Soviet Union in the past or in other countries.
    (1) Panama Canal excavated 180 million cubic meters. (The Panama Canal is 81 kilometers long)
    (2) Suez Canal excavated 75 million cubic meters.
    (3) Moscow Canal (Moscow River - Volga River) excavated 151 million cubic meters.
    (4) Stalin Canal (White Sea - Baltic Sea) excavated 10 million cubic meters.
    The Panama Canal was built for decades from 1881 to 1914. The Suez Canal was also built for decades. The average annual amount of soil excavated from the Volga-Don Canal project is several times more than that of the Panama, Suez, or even Moscow Canal and the Stalin Canal. The use of cheap labor of colonial slaves in the construction of the Panama and Suez Canals is the fundamental production basis on which these construction projects are based. The high mortality rate and acute malaria during the construction of the Panama Canal greatly damaged the health of the workers. The speed of work when building the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal and the Moscow Canal cannot meet the requirements of the Volga-Don Canal builders. It would take nearly 32,000 working days just to complete the transportation and laying of 164 million cubic meters of soil.
    Soviet technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. Not long ago, for example, when the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station was being built, excavation work was mainly done by earthworkers, and transportation work was also done by porters. But now, manual excavation has almost disappeared in communist construction. Machines have replaced manpower. Excavators, bulldozers, transporters and other machinery have appeared, so many new occupations have emerged: excavator drivers, pusher drivers, crane drivers, etc.
    Now a most interesting earth-excavating machine working on the ground is used - the automatic mobile excavator, which the builders call the "Prairie Giant" (ωш14/65). First of all, it should be pointed out that there is no such machine abroad now, and it has just begun to be designed in Britain. The bucket capacity of this machine is 14 cubic meters, which is equivalent to a small car, and the boom is 65 meters long, which is equal to the height of a dozen floors. The entire machine weighs more than 1,000 tons, and it takes 96 carriages to transport all the parts. The cabin inside the machine is as high as a three-story house. There are 48 generators inside the machine, and the electricity it consumes is equivalent to the electricity used by a medium-sized city. It rotates once per minute, can excavate 14 cubic meters of soil, excavate to a depth of 45 meters, and send the excavated soil to 120 meters away. It can excavate 2,700 cubic meters of soil per day and night, which can replace the work of more than 7,000 earthworkers, and now this number has been increased to 10,000 to 14,200 cubic meters.
    6. Concrete and reinforced concrete work. The concrete and reinforced concrete work in the construction of the Volga-Don Canal has been completely mechanized. The construction project requires a total of 2.96 million cubic meters of concrete, and seven automatic mechanized factories guarantee the concrete used for the Volga-Don navigable canal and the Tsimlyansk Sea projects.
    The staff of such a mechanized factory is only eight workers and staff per shift: a dispatcher, three photographers, an electrician, and three fitters.
    The loading and paving of concrete are all mechanized.
    Mass socialist competition played a great role in accelerating the construction work, and the Communists participating in the construction were the soul of this movement. This great construction project is equipped with the most advanced technology, which has never been used before. The party organization has strived to enable workers to master these new machines as soon as possible. Socialist competition movements have been widely carried out among excavator drivers. The "assembly line operation method," the machine work schedule system every day and night, the concrete pouring method of pouring two models at the same time, and the advanced production and work methods such as pouring the concrete project of the pumping station directly from the automatic loading and unloading vehicles have also been widely used in the construction project.
    It is necessary to briefly talk about the architectural art of the Volga-Don navigable canal. The architectural style of many magnificent construction projects in the Soviet Union is the most beautiful and spectacular architectural style. This architectural style demonstrates the greatness of the Stalin era in building a new communist society. The subway stations in Moscow and other cities, and the architectural forms of newly completed buildings, especially some high-rise buildings, clearly illustrate this point.
    The Soviet Union also pays great attention to the architectural art of water conservancy projects.
    The architectural art of the Volga-Don Canal is a unified and magnificent complex. The characteristics of each building in this complex are based on the artistic methods created by the most outstanding images in Russian classical architecture.
    At the entrance of the Volga-Don Canal, from the Volga River side, the first thing you can see is the statue of Comrade Stalin, the inspirer and leader of the Soviet people in their struggle to build communism. The statue is 22 meters long. The statue is made of red copper, and the base and stone steps are made of granite.
    Large-scale buildings with the same style have been built on the south bank of the entrance from the Volga River. These buildings will compete with the new architectural art of the developing heroic city of Stalingrad.
    The locks where the Volga River and the Don River enter the canal are built into triumphal arches.
    The entire architectural composition on the Don River side ends with a lock, and the gate building is like a statue of a knight - the Don Cossack.
    The basic idea that determines the architectural art of the Volga-Don navigable canal is to express two points in the architectural art:
    (1) The great significance of Stalin's plan to transform nature and the construction of a deep-water waterway connecting five seas to the national economy.
    (2) The Volga-Don Canal is built in a place of historical significance, where the great battles of "Defense of Tsaritsyn" and "Defense of Stalingrad" to defend the Soviet motherland were fought.

    关于伏尔加河—顿河运河
    （六月二十六日在北京市中苏友好协会和苏联对外文化协会举办的苏联伟大共产主义建设工程报告会上的演说摘要）
    苏联水利专家  沙什柯夫
    一九五二年五月三十一日，一个具有历史意义的事件发生了——俄罗斯的两条大河，伏尔加河和顿河连结起来了。俄罗斯人民世世代代的梦想实现了。伏尔加河—顿河运河的建设者光荣地完成了苏联共产党和政府所提出的提前完成伏尔加河—顿河运河的任务。我相信，亿万中国人民和各人民民主国家的人民必将分享苏联人民的快乐，同样的，全世界的进步人类也将分享这一快乐。
    中国人民正在与自然灾害进行斗争：建筑堤坝，与水旱灾斗争；开凿运河，使自然服从于人类。因此，建设伏尔加河—顿河运河的经验，不仅能为苏联人民在进行其他的共产主义建筑时所利用，并且也可能为中国人民及人民民主国家的人民在与自然的斗争中所利用。
    远在古代的时候，俄罗斯商人便与丰饶的黑海沿岸各国进行了频繁的贸易。当时各国间进行贸易的主要通道是水路。要想通过水路从伏尔加河进入亚速海和黑海，就必须越过伏尔加河与顿河之间的分水岭。那时商人们为了从伏尔加河到黑海沿岸，曾带上自己的货物坐在很小、很浅的船上顺着伏尔加河航进，然后又顺着伏尔加河的支流卡米新河前进。到了水路尽头，商人们便不得不把自己的船只拖到岸上，然后把船放在滚木上，拖到顿河的支流伊洛夫梁河上去。后来，当俄罗斯作为一个民族国家巩固起来的时候，在彼得大帝时代就提出了伏尔加河和顿河之间的水路问题。彼得大帝由于关心与地中海各国进行贸易，便决定修建通航运河。由于当时对外政治形势（与瑞典进行战争延续了二十一年之久），建设工作未能顺利进行，于是便半途而废了。沙皇时代俄国先进的工程师们曾多次地又提到了这个问题。从彼得大帝时代开始一直到一九一一年为止，提交沙皇政府审查的沟通伏尔加河和顿河的方案将近有三十个左右。但是这些方案都因种种藉口而被埋藏在沙皇行政机关的档案中，始终没有见到天日。其原因除了由于沙皇政府官员对解决如何利用水量充沛的俄罗斯河流这样一个重大问题采取了漠不关心的态度之外，沙皇俄国也没有力量来修建这样一条运河。
    但是在十月革命刚刚取得了胜利，国内战争还在激烈地进行的时候，列宁便在一九一八年人民委员会的一次会议上提出了加速有关建筑伏尔加河—顿河运河的计划工作的问题，列宁是非常重视这条运河的工程的，他认为这条运河是一条“强大的运输杠杆”，可以扭转俄国东南部落后地区的经济。在进行了许多研究准备工作来勘察运河的路线之后，便开始设计运河修建的方案。一九二九年便完成了设计的工作。其任务是要改变大自然，把航运、动力、水利灌溉以及其他一些个别的但又是重要的问题放在一起解决。建设工程还在第二次世界大战之前便已经开始了。卫国战争爆发之后，运河的修建工作曾经停顿。战争结束之后，苏联人民委员会在一九四七年，就通过了恢复伏尔加河—顿河运河建设工程的决议。接着苏联政府在一九五零年十二月二十八日发布了提前两年完成伏尔加河—顿河运河及有关水利工程的决定，给这一工程提出了更为广泛的任务。
    这一工程的内容包括长达一百零一公里的伏尔加河与顿河之间的通航运河、能容一百二十六亿立方公尺调节水量的齐姆良水库、具有发电能力十六万瓩的齐姆良水电站和灌溉及供水二百七十五万公顷土地的灌溉系统。它可以同时解决运输、动力、灌溉等问题。
    现在将伏尔加河—顿河运河主要部分在技术上的一些特点及其兴修工作略述如下：
    一、伏尔加河—顿河通航运河是一个多种多样的水力技术工程，除了十三道水闸和三座抽水站之外，还建有溢水道，供修理时用的止水门、码头、泊船处以及其他各种水力技术建筑。运河航线上并建筑三个共容水四亿立方公尺的水库。
    通航运河的航线是从卡拉奇到斯大林格勒，穿过草原上的三条河流——卡尔波夫卡河、齐尔夫连纳雅河和沙尔巴河。这些河流上都修筑有堤坝，构成了一系列的人工水库。这些水库由广阔的设有水闸的运河彼此相联起来。
    伏尔加河和顿河中间的分水岭高出伏尔加河岸红军城附近的河面八十八公尺，比顿河的河面高出四十四公尺。为了使河水能越过分水岭，就要建立十三道水闸和三个抽水站。每一抽水站每秒钟可以抽水四十五立方公尺，三个抽水站同时从顿河抽水，可以吸干顿河。
    二、齐姆良水库（即齐姆良海）也是水力工程的主要部分之一。它是在顿河河道上建筑一道长达十二点七五公里的堤坝拦阻顿河的水而形成的。水库长达一百八十公里，宽约三十公里。调节水量为一百二十六亿立方公尺。当风大的时候，水库里的水浪高达三公尺。
    除了供给通航运河所需要的水之外，“齐姆良海”还要灌溉斯大林格勒和罗斯多夫两州干旱地带，并供应这些地区用水，保证水电站的工作。此外它还要不断地放水，提高从齐姆良到罗斯多夫这一段顿河的水位。
    齐姆良水库是世界上最大的人工水库。它一年当中的水面蒸发量就等于莫斯科海的全部容水量。其全部水量的压力全靠堤坝来支持。堤坝是在沙地上修建起来的，这在世界水利建筑史上还是第一次；而且堤坝上长达十二点八公里的堤身也是用沙土筑成的。苏联的水利技术人员解决了在松软的土地上，特别是在沙地上修建堤坝的问题，这是一个很艰巨的技术问题。按照国外水利工程师们一直存在的，而且直到目前仍然保留的意见，首先是美国水利工程师的意见，修建受压很大的堤坝，只有把堤身筑在岩石上才有可能。但是苏联的科学和技术思想已经超过了外国，而且在解决许多技术问题上更远远地超过了他们。
    堤坝土工部分是采用“冲积法”（即水力机械化的办法）来完成的。世界水力建筑工程在用机器操纵水力方面远没有过像伏尔加河—顿河通航运河建筑者所采用的这样大的规模和这样高的速度。数十架吸土机从河底把沙土和水一道吸上来，这种叫作“泥沙”的水与土的混合物就顺着直径一公尺的输送管流到建筑堤坝的现场上，逐渐集成堤身。堤坝建筑中用冲积法送来的土共有二千六百万立方公尺。这种机器一年可以冲积一百五十万至二百六十万立方公尺的土。因此建筑一个体积有两千六百万立方公尺的堤坝，只需要八个到十个这种机械就可以完成。
    三、水电站——苏联部长会议决定在齐姆良堤坝上建立一个发电能力为十六万瓩的水电站。该水电站可以充分供给农业灌溉区和工业区的电力，同时还能供给由齐姆良水库向通航运河送水的抽水站的电力。
    齐姆良水电站中共设有四个发电机，每一个发电机的发电能力是四万瓩。
    四、顿河干渠的地下水渠。在修凿灌溉系统中，苏联建筑者解决了一个特殊的问题。在顿河与萨尔河之间有一段高地，顿河干渠必须通过这一高地沟通齐姆良水库与上萨尔水渠。如果用挖掘明渠的方法，要掘出约六千万立方公尺的泥土，而苏联建筑者由于建筑了一道长达六公里的地下渠，就使挖土量减少许多倍。虽然当地土质条件很不好，是些很不坚固的散沙地层，但依靠苏联地下铁道建筑者们所积累的经验，建筑工作进行得很顺利。建筑地下渠的全部过程都是机械化的。
    五、在土方工程方面，伏尔加河—顿河运河掘土的数量是一亿五千二百一十万立方公尺。现在把这个数目和苏联过去的或其他国家同类工程的掘土量加以比较一下。
    （1）巴拿马运河掘土一亿八千万立方公尺。（巴拿马运河长八十一公里）
    （2）苏彝士运河掘土七千五百万立方公尺。
    （3）莫斯科运河（莫斯科河—伏尔加河）掘土一亿五千一百万立方公尺。
    （4）斯大林运河（白海—波罗的海）掘土一千万立方公尺。
    巴拿马运河从一八八一年到一九一四年建设了几十年。苏彝士运河也建筑了几十年，伏尔加河—顿河运河工程每年平均的挖土量比巴拿马、苏彝士，甚至莫斯科运河以及斯大林运河都多几倍。在建筑巴拿马与苏彝士运河中，使用殖民地奴隶的廉价劳动力，就是这些建筑工程所依据的根本的生产基础。在巴拿马运河建筑时期高度的死亡率、急性的疟疾大大地损害工人的健康。建设白海—波罗的海运河及莫斯科运河时的工作速度现在也不能满足伏尔加河—顿河运河建筑者们的要求了。仅仅完成一亿六千四百万立方公尺泥土的搬运和铺设工作，就需要将近三万二千劳动日。
    苏联的技术是在大步前进着的。还在不久以前，例如在修建第聂伯水电站时，挖土工作主要是由土工来进行，搬运工作也是由搬运工人来完成的。但是现在在进行共产主义建设中人工掘土已近乎绝迹了。机器代替了人力。掘土机、推土机、搬运机和另外的机械都出现了，因此产生了许多新的职业：掘土机司机、推动机司机、起重机司机等。
    现在使用了一种最有趣味的在地面上工作的掘土机器——自动移动掘土机，即建筑者们称为“草原巨人”的（ωш14／65）。首先应当指出在国外现在还没有这样的机器，在英国刚刚开始设计。这种机器吊斗的容积为十四立方公尺，相当于一部小汽车，吊杆长六十五公尺，等于十几层楼高。全部机器重一千吨以上，运走全部零件需要九十六个车箱。机器内的座舱有三层楼房子高。机器内部装有四十八部发电机，它所消耗的电力相当于一个中等城市所用的电力。它每分钟运转一次，可以挖掘十四立方公尺泥土，挖掘的深度达四十五公尺，并把所挖的泥土送到一百二十公尺以外。每昼夜可以掘土二千七百立方公尺，即可以代替七千多挖土工人的工作，现在这一数字更提高到一万至一万四千二百立方公尺。
    六、混凝土和钢筋混凝土工作。伏尔加河—顿河运河建设工程中的混凝土和钢筋混凝土工作已经全部机械化了。建筑工程共需要二百九十六万立方公尺的混凝土，七个自动机械化工厂保证了伏尔加河—顿河通航运河和齐姆良海的工程所用的混凝土。
    这样一个机械化工厂中每班的工作人员仅仅只有八个工人和职员：一个调度员，三个摄影师，一个电工和三个钳工。
    混凝土的装铺工作都是机械化了的。
    群众性社会主义竞赛在加速建筑工作方面起了很大的作用，参加建筑的共产党员们是这个运动的灵魂。这一伟大的建筑工程是以最先进的技术装配着的，这种先进技术以前从未使用过。党的组织曾努力地使工人们尽快地掌握这些新的机器。在掘土机司机中广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛运动。在建筑工程中，还广泛地采用了“流水作业法”，采用了每昼夜机器工作进程表制度，采用了每次同时浇灌两个模型的混凝土浇灌法、直接由自动装卸汽车来浇灌抽水站混凝土工程等先进的生产工作方法。
    简单地讲一下伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建筑艺术是必要的。苏联许多雄伟的建筑工程的建筑风格是最美丽壮观的建筑风格。在这种建筑风格中表现了建设新的共产主义社会的斯大林时代的伟大。莫斯科及其他城市的地下铁道车站，和新落成的建筑物，尤其是一些高楼大厦的建筑形式都明显地说明了这一点。
    苏联对于水利工程的建筑艺术也是很注意的。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑艺术是一种统一的宏伟的综合体，在这个综合体中各个建筑的特征又都是根据俄罗斯古典建筑术中最优秀的形象所创造出的艺术方式。
    在伏尔加河—顿河运河的入口处，从伏尔加河那面首先可以看到的就是苏联人民为建设共产主义而进行的斗争的鼓舞者和领导者斯大林同志的雕像。这个雕像的身长二十二公尺。雕像用紫铜铸造，像座和石阶都用花岗石做成。
    从伏尔加河进入运河处南岸上都进行了大规模的具有同一风格的建筑，这些建筑物将和正在发展中的英雄城斯大林格勒的新的建筑艺术互相媲美。
    伏尔加河以及顿河进入运河的水闸都建筑成凯旋门。
    顿河方面的整个建筑艺术上的构图由一个水闸来结束，闸门建筑像是骑士——顿河的哥萨克的雕像。
    决定伏尔加河—顿河通航运河建筑艺术的基本思想，就是要在建筑艺术上表现出两点来：
    （1）斯大林改造自然计划以及连结五个海的深水航路的建设，对于国民经济的伟大意义。
    （2）伏尔加河—顿河运河是修在一个具有历史意义的地方，在这里曾经进行过保卫苏维埃祖国的“保卫察里津”和“保卫斯大林格勒”的大战。
