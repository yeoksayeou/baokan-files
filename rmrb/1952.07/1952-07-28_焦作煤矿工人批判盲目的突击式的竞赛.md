    Jiaozuo Coal Mine Workers Criticize Blind, Hasty Crash Competitions
    Editor: Recently, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Bureau held a workers' representative meeting to mobilize for the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. At the meeting, the representatives criticized the past crash competitions that simply increased labor intensity, damaged project specifications, and failed to comply with safety regulations. Everyone recognized that this Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign was very different from the past. In the past, whenever a holiday approached, everyone would work in a crash mode, just intending to dig a few more meters or produce a few more carts of coal. As a result of this kind of competition, project specifications were damaged. One month of crash work would require several months of repairs. In fact, it not only did not increase production, but also increased costs. The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign cannot just blow over like a gust of wind. It is a production reform movement. We will create new records on the basis of improving labor organization and operational methods, improving efficiency and quality, and reducing costs.

    焦作煤矿工人批判盲目的突击式的竞赛
    编辑同志：最近，我们焦作煤矿矿务局召开了一次工人代表会，动员进行增产节约运动。会上，代表们对过去用单纯增加劳动强度、破坏工程规格、不遵守保安规程的突击式的竞赛作了批判，大家认清了这次增产节约竞赛运动和过去大不相同，过去每逢到节日，大家就突击式地干一阵，只打算多掘进几公尺，多出几车煤就行了。这种竞赛的结果，工程规格遭到破坏，一个月的突击，要花费好几个月的时间来修理。实际上不但没有增加产量，而且增加了成本。增产节约运动不能再像一阵风一样刮过去就算了，而是一个生产改革的运动。我们将在改进劳动组织和操作方法、提高效率、质量、降低成本的基础上来创造新纪录。  徐祚民
