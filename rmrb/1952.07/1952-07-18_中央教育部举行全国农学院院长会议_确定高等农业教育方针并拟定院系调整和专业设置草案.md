Attending and observing the conference were responsible individuals and representatives from the Central Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Water Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and other relevant organizations, as well as responsible individuals from the agricultural and forestry departments and higher education departments of major administrative regions, and presidents, deans, vice-presidents, and academic affairs directors of various agricultural colleges and universities, totaling sixty-five people. The conference discussed the guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural schools, institutional adjustments, the establishment of departments, faculties, and specializations, teacher allocation, enrollment, funding, and textbook compilation, with a focus on institutional adjustments and specialization setup.

During the conference, Minister of Education Ma Xulun delivered a report on the guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural schools and the principles for setting up departments, faculties, and specializations.

Soviet experts Fomin and Ivanov delivered reports on the development process, teaching system, and specialization setup of Soviet agricultural education. Vice-Minister of Education Zeng Zhaolun delivered a report on the draft plan for institutional adjustments. These reports provided great inspiration and assistance to the representatives. Everyone gained a clear understanding of the guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural schools. The guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural schools are: to cultivate a large number of senior technical cadres with broad agricultural science knowledge for state-owned farms, forest farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and cooperative forest farms; agricultural and forestry scientific research talents; agricultural and forestry technical administrative cadres above the county level; and teachers for secondary agricultural and forestry schools. At the same time, the representatives recognized the superiority of the Soviet specialization teaching system and the necessity of specialization setup. In further discussions on institutional adjustments, the representatives, based on Minister Ma Xulun's instruction to "set up departments, faculties, and specializations with a pragmatic spirit and based on actual needs," repeatedly conducted research and discussions with a serious and responsible attitude, and drafted a plan for the institutional adjustment and specialization setup of higher agricultural schools. The draft is currently being consulted upon by the Central Ministry of Education in conjunction with relevant departments and submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval. The conference also broadly exchanged views on teacher allocation, enrollment, funding, and textbook compilation.

At the closing meeting on July 11th, Vice-Minister of Education Qian Junrui, in his summary report, emphasized the direction of higher agricultural schools' efforts in the next three to five years: first, to concentrate efforts on running agricultural specializations well, and cultivate a large number of senior agricultural construction talents with broad agricultural science knowledge; diligently study advanced Soviet agricultural science, earnestly summarize farmers' experiences, and popularize agricultural science knowledge to improve agricultural production technology and promote the cooperation and collectivization of agricultural production.

The representatives unanimously expressed their willingness to strive for the complete realization of the new guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural education with full conviction and determination.
