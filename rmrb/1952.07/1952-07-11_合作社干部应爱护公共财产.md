    Cooperative Cadres Should Cherish Public Property

    Editor: We recently went to various grassroots cooperatives in Xi'an County, Liaodong, to inspect their work and discovered that waste was very serious in some grassroots cooperatives. For example, the Weisifen branch of Ping'an Village prepared eighty jin of blood meal (contained in pig bladders) for the masses during the spring plowing. After it was brought to the branch, it was thrown into a dilapidated warehouse without a door, and dogs ate fifty-four jin of it. Comrade Gao Liankui, who was in charge of storing the blood meal, not only did not admit his mistake but instead blamed the warehouse for not having a door. At the Dading branch of the Central Village Cooperative, about three hundred jin of beans in the warehouse were soaked by rainwater that had seeped in through rat holes. The beans had been soaked into a mud-like consistency, but cooperative cadre Wu Wenju said: "It's nothing! We can send it to the tofu shop, and it can still be sold for money." The phenomenon of cooperatives across the county losing money and goods is also very serious.

    These phenomena fully demonstrate the shockingly careless attitude some of our cooperative cadres have toward cooperative property!

    In the future, in addition to strengthening education for cooperative cadres to raise their political awareness and their sense of responsibility for cherishing cooperative property, village cooperatives should also strengthen their leadership and management of branches, and leading comrades of the joint cooperatives should also go deep down to help grassroots cooperatives solve problems.

### 合作社干部应爱护公共财产

    合作社干部应爱护公共财产
    编辑同志：我们最近到辽东西安县各基层合作社去检查工作，发现某些基层社浪费现象很严重。如平安村的威思分社把春耕时给群众准备下的八十斤血粉（用猪膀胱装着），拉到分社后，就扔到无门的破仓库里，被狗吃了五十四斤。保管血粉的高连奎同志不但不承认错误，反而埋怨仓库无门。中心村社的大顶分社，仓库的豆子被由鼠洞灌进来的雨水“泡”了三百来斤，豆子已“泡”成泥一样，合作社干部吴文举还说：“没啥！送到豆腐房，这都能卖钱。”全县合作社丢款少货的现象也很严重。
    这些现象都充分说明了我们有一些合作社干部，对合作社的财产不关心到了怎样惊人的程度！
    今后除加强对合作社干部进行教育，提高其政治觉悟，提高他们爱护合作社财产的责任心外，村社也要加强对分社的领导管理，联社的领导同志也要深入下去，帮助基层社解决问题。
