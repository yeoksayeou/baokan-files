    Resolution on the Question of Ending the Korean War
    Korea has suffered the ravages of a cruel war for more than two years. This war is characterized by the destruction of civilians, the massacre and abuse of prisoners of war, the indiscriminate bombing of undefended cities, and the use of napalm and poison gas. After studying the documents submitted to the Council for consideration, the World Peace Council believes that biological weapons have also been used in Korea. The aggressive actions of the American army against China are becoming more and more frequent, thus creating a crisis of escalating war. Following the bombing of many cities in China, the use of biological weapons on Chinese territory, and repeated threats to use atomic bombs, the recent bombing of power plants on the Yalu River that supply electricity to Northeast China's industry is a deliberate act of provocation aimed at making the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement more difficult.
    The United States is responsible not only for the war methods being adopted by the US military command in Korea and the constant obstruction of ceasefire negotiations, but also the governments of all countries that support the United Nations' illegal interference in the Korean civil war and provide armed forces to the US military high command in Korea are responsible. The activities of this command, carried out in the name of the United Nations, are incompatible with the peaceful purposes proclaimed in the United Nations Charter. In order to end the suffering of the Korean people and maintain peace, the World Peace Council calls on all people to demand: (1) The signing of a ceasefire agreement in accordance with the principles of respect for international law and custom to immediately end hostilities; whether a ceasefire agreement can be signed now depends entirely on whether the US delegation abandons its unreasonable demands on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. (2) All countries should ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, which prohibits the use of bacteriological warfare methods. The realization of these urgent demands can establish a lasting peace in Korea through peaceful and just solutions, by respecting the freely expressed will of the Korean people, and by withdrawing foreign troops from their territory. The brutality of the Korean War and the use of weapons of mass destruction are a serious warning to the people of the world.

    关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议
    朝鲜遭受残酷战争的蹂躏已经两年多了，这个战争的特点是毁灭平民，屠杀与虐待战俘，滥炸不设防城市，使用凝固汽油弹和毒气。世界和平理事会在研究了提交理事会审议的文件之后，认为在朝鲜还使用了生物武器。美国军队对中国的侵略行动正越来越频繁，从而造成了扩大战争的危机；继轰炸中国的许多城市、在中国领土上使用生物武器、并再三扬言要使用原子弹之后，最近竟然又轰炸鸭绿江上以电力供给中国东北工业的发电厂，这是一种蓄谋的挑衅行动，目的是要使缔结停战协议更趋困难。
    对于美军司令部在朝鲜正在采用的战争手段以及停战谈判所不断遭受的阻挠，不仅美国应负责任，而且凡是支持联合国非法干涉朝鲜内战并向朝鲜美军最高司令部提供武装部队的国家的政府，都要负责。这个司令部假借联合国的名义而进行的活动，是和联合国宪章所宣布的和平宗旨不相容的。世界和平理事会为了结束朝鲜人民的苦难并维护和平，号召所有的人民起来要求：（一）在尊重国际法和惯例的原则下签订停战协议，立即结束敌对行动；停战协议能否签订现在完全取决于美方代表团是否放弃它在战俘遣返问题上的无理要求。（二）一切国家都批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用细菌作战方法的日内瓦议定书。实现了这些迫切的要求，就能借和平公正的解决办法，借尊重朝鲜人民自由表示的意志，并从他们领土上撤退外国军队的办法在朝鲜建立持久的和平。朝鲜战争的残酷性及使用大规模毁灭的武器，是对全世界人民的一个严重警告。
