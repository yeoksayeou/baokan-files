Chairman, fellow representatives,
    In addition to the situation of local industry and commerce in Tibet and the several hopes put forward by Representative Guixiangba·Gonga Najia, I would like to add some more opinions:
    First of all, since World War II, British imperialism has prohibited the import of daily necessities into Tibet, with the exception of a small amount of sugar, causing difficulties in the lives of the Tibetan people. Tibet needs various fabrics. In the past, the weight of fabrics imported from India was 1,200 pounds per year, but it has gradually decreased to 400 pounds per year in recent years.
    Since the people of India are friendly to the people of Tibet, and our country has established diplomatic relations with the Indian government, based on this situation, we hope to conduct normal trade with India. We also hope to assist the Commercial Association organized by Tibet in obtaining various conveniences for conducting this normal trade.
    Now, our country's internal production and the quantity of necessary production materials have developed unprecedentedly. We hope that merchants from all parts of our country will give Tibetan merchants various conveniences with the attitude of concern within a large family of brotherly ethnic groups, so that the daily necessities of the Tibetan people will not only be supplied in large quantities from the mainland, but also a large amount of local Tibetan specialties will continue to flow to the mainland. This will inevitably play a great role in promoting mutual exchange and developing Tibet's industry and commerce and prospering Tibet's economy. Therefore, we urgently hope that the Kangzang Highway will be completed as soon as possible.
    We firmly support the direction pointed out in Chairman Chen Shutong's opening speech and Director Chen Yun's report, and we are willing to follow this direction and actively struggle.
    Let us shout:
    Long live the great unity of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

### 在全国工商联筹备代表会议上西藏代表三多仓·罗桑格登的发言

    在全国工商联筹备代表会议上西藏代表三多仓·罗桑格登的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    除桂香巴·贡尕那嘉代表所谈的西藏地方工商业的情况和提出的几点希望外，我再补充一些意见：
    首先，自第二次世界大战以来，英帝国主义就把西藏日常生活必需物品，除仅沙糖一类继续可以购买不多的数量外，其余的饮食物品，都禁止输入西藏，造成西藏人民生活上的困难。西藏需要各种布匹，从前，每年由印度输入的布匹重量是一千二百磅，以后就逐渐减少到数年前的每年四百磅。
    由于印度人民与西藏地方人民是友好的，我国同印度政府又已建立了外交关系，基于这种情况，我们希望与印度进行正常贸易。并希望协助西藏地方组织的商联会取得进行这种正常贸易的各种便利。
    现在我国内部生产事业和生产必需物品数量已空前地发展，希望我国各地的商人，以兄弟民族大家庭内部的关切态度，给藏商各种便利，使西藏人民的日常生活必需物品，不但由内地获得源源不绝的大量供应，而且将西藏地方的大量土特产，也不断地流向内地。这在增进互通有无和发展西藏的工商业，繁荣西藏经济上，必然起很大的作用。因此，我们迫切希望康藏公路赶快修筑完竣。
    我们坚决拥护陈叔通主席的开幕词和陈云主任的报告所指给我们的方向，并愿遵循此方向而积极奋斗。
    让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国各民族大团结万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
