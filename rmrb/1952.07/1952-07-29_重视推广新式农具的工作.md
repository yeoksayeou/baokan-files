    Emphasizing the Work of Popularizing New-Style Farm Tools
    In this year's patriotic production increase movement, mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms in various regions have increased production due to the use of new-style farm tools. Many mutual aid teams have been further consolidated and improved through the joint purchase and use of new-style farm tools. Farmers have personally witnessed the fact that the use of new-style farm tools improves production and have requested to organize in order to jointly purchase or borrow new-style farm tools from the state. Countless facts have proven that leading farmers to organize and promoting the use of new-style farm tools are two basic links in improving agricultural productivity.
    In the past two or three years, Northeast China has vigorously promoted new-style farm tools and has made preliminary achievements. Many places in North China and East China have also paid attention to the work of popularizing new-style farm tools. However, on a national scale, new-style farm tools have not been widely popularized. This is not only due to the limited supply conditions of new-style farm tools, but more importantly, because many cadres still underestimate the important significance and role of new-style farm tools. These comrades do not yet understand that after the feudal land system has been abolished and the vast number of farmers have gradually organized, that is, after fundamental changes have taken place in the relations of production, improving production tools has become an important condition for improving agricultural productivity. Therefore, timely supplying farmers with sufficient new-style farm tools and widely imparting the technology of using new-style farm tools have become important tasks in the current agricultural production increase movement. State-owned farms and agricultural tool promotion stations in many places in North China, Northeast China, and East China have established technical research associations in nearby districts and townships, with labor models as the backbone and mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives as the foundation, to teach farmers the technology of using new-style farm tools, thus forming an agricultural technology promotion network. This promotion network has played a significant role in this year's production increase movement and is worthy of promotion in various regions.

    重视推广新式农具的工作
    在今年的爱国增产运动中，各地互助组、农业生产合作社和国营农场，由于使用新式农具而提高了生产量，许多互助组因共同购置与使用了新式农具，而有了进一步的巩固和提高。农民们亲眼看到了使用新式农具提高了生产的事实，纷纷要求组织起来，以便共同购置或向国家赊贷新式农具。无数事实证明，领导农民组织起来和提倡使用新式农具，是提高农业生产力的两个基本环节。
    两三年来，东北各地大力推广新式农具，已经做出了初步成绩。华北、华东不少地方也注意了推广新式农具的工作。但是，就全国范围来说，新式农具还没有普遍推广开来。这不仅是由于新式农具的供应条件有限制，更重要的，是由于许多干部对于新式农具的重要意义和作用还估计不足。这些同志还不了解当着封建的土地制度已被废除，广大农民逐步组织起来，即生产关系发生了根本的变化以后，改良生产工具，就成为提高农业生产力的重要条件了。因此，及时供应农民以足够的新式农具，广泛传授使用新式农具的技术，已经成为目前农业增产运动中的重要工作。华北、东北和华东许多地方的国营农场和农具推广站，都在附近区乡成立了技术研究会，以劳动模范为骨干，以互助组和农业生产合作社为基础，向农民传授使用新式农具的技术，这就形成了农业技术推广网。这种推广网在今年的增产运动中已经发挥了很大的作用，值得在各地推行。
