    Against Fascist Bloody National Discrimination Policies
    ——After Watching the Polish Film "Warsaw Street"
    Yuan Shuipai
    Eight years ago today (July 22, 1944), the Polish people began to be liberated from the enslavement of German fascists. The Chinese people, far in the East but closely linked with our friends because of the common glorious cause of defending peace, are joyously celebrating the National Day of our brother country today!
    At this time, the screening of "Warsaw Street," one of Poland's excellent films and the first film of the Polish Republic to meet Chinese audiences [Note 1], is of great significance. It will deepen the Chinese people's understanding of the Polish people's struggle history, promote cultural exchange and friendship between China and Poland, and will also enable our audience to further and universally and deeply recognize the shameful face of German fascism and its bloody crimes, strengthening our hatred of imperialism and our determination to defend peace.
    Let us look back at this page of painful history.
    Poland was one of the countries most severely damaged in World War II. During the war and the Nazi occupation, more than six million Polish people were killed, including more than three million Polish Jews. Hitler's policy of national oppression and national discrimination, which was also shared by other imperialists in the world, incited his beastly army to carry out unprecedented and cruel massacres. According to statistics, before the German invasion, there were about 3.2 million to 3.25 million Jews in Poland. By the end of the war, only 40,000 to 50,000 were still alive. That is to say, only 1.3% or 1.6% survived. Of the 9,612,000 Jews in Europe, 5,787,000 were sacrificed during the German occupation, and more than half of them were Polish Jews [Note 2]. How shocking these figures are! However, in the eyes of the bloodthirsty Nazi executioners, it was the "completion" of a "large-scale operation" (German term). On April 19, 1943, 30,000 Jews confined in the Warsaw Ghetto bravely revolted, using inferior weapons to resist the crazy bombing of German artillery, tanks, and aircraft. The German army, according to Hitler's original plan, burned down the entire Jewish district. By May 16, this bloody massacre was over. In the Nuremberg trials of war criminals, a document appeared, which was a report from the German army in Warsaw to Berlin after committing this crime. The cover was "boastfully" marked in delicate italic art letters: "Warsaw no longer has a Jewish residential area" [Note 3].
    In the film "Warsaw Street," we can see the tragic scene of the destruction of the Jewish district: following hunger, disease, and arbitrary killings, there was the encirclement of tanks and the bombing of aircraft, and house-to-house arson… Women, the elderly, and children were burned to death, and Polish firefighters were shot by German bandits… At the same time, we can also see how the Jewish underground army bravely and tenaciously fought against the invaders. According to historical records, the insurgents persisted for three weeks. On the last day of resistance, Jewish fighters wrapped themselves in the Polish flag, stood on the burning six-story rooftop, and jumped into the flames. Such heroic deeds are similarly portrayed in the film.
    The Jewish working people are also patriots and determined anti-fascist fighters. The Polish and Jewish working people should not be split. They should unite closely to fight against the enemies who spread the germs of national discrimination – this understanding, the film tells us, was not clear in the minds of some Polish people and Polish Jews before and after the outbreak of the war. They had long suffered from the insidious deceptive propaganda of the Nazis and the domestic bourgeoisie and landlord class.
    The Jewish old tailor Reiberman and the Polish bank clerk Huateng represent such a group of people in the film. The old tailor has narrow traditional concepts and strong religious ideas. Until he faced the fate of being concentrated in the Jewish district to suffer massacre, he mistakenly thought that "it might be better to separate us Jews," and his wife also thought that "at least in the Jewish district, everyone is the same." When Reiberman closed the windows and refused to listen to the German street broadcasters shouting "Jews are an inferior nation, a scum of humanity," he was pained, but he did not understand. He merely thought this was another national oppression and religious persecution. He never imagined that the essence of Hitler's anti-Semitism was class oppression, a vicious means for imperialism to carry out foreign aggression and domestic suppression of the working people and to split the working people.
    Bank clerk Huateng was still convinced on the eve of the war that "Hitler dare not fight," and that the war "was a Jewish rumor to get rich." He warned his children not to play with Jewish children, thinking they were "dirty children." However, the reality of the war educated him after all. He saw that Jews were like him, and immediately joined the army to defend Poland as soon as the war broke out, and that the Jewish old tailor would rather risk his life to stand firm in the face of the German bandits and not betray him—a Pole—to the enemy. Therefore, Huateng finally realized that his "past discrimination against Jews was wrong," and he also corrected his children's equally wrong thinking.
    The Jewish and Polish working class were not like this. The Jewish electrical worker Nadan and the Polish coachman Shaboli Guski were not subjected to this political deception. Nadan clearly recognized that the fascists "want to eliminate our Poland, split us up, and separate the Polish people from us Jews, this is their bloody rule policy. We can only resist if we unite." When his father-in-law, the old tailor, only narrowly felt national oppression and sighed "Suffering Jewish people," Nadan immediately emphatically repeated, "It's not just us who are suffering, it's not just us who are suffering." The Polish coachman, who had the same lack of racial prejudice as the Jewish electrical worker, represented another type of person. He did not have Nadan's high degree of political awareness as an industrial worker. He simply loved his country and despised and hated the invaders. He had a sense of justice, openly ridiculed the traitors who surrendered to the enemy, and generously helped the persecuted Reiberman family, but he only thought they were neighbors and should help each other. "If you help him today, maybe he will help you tomorrow." He represents the honest and kind people in the lower layers of the old society.
    The film uses concise shots, thought-provoking dialogues that fit their identities, and vivid descriptions of real life to vividly portray the personalities of these and other characters, as well as the actions that correspond to their personalities. The image of each person is clearly prominent.
    They are all ordinary Polish people. Through the depiction of these ordinary people and a group of young children, the film meaningfully reflects a segment of historical times. Most of them, under the rule of the bourgeoisie, lived a life of defenseless, scattered individuals, with little understanding and little vigilance about fascism and war. They were worried, but unwilling to believe, that the war was already knocking on their door. Even if the street broadcaster had already shouted the news that Warsaw had announced an air raid alarm, coachman Shaboli Guski still looked up and pointed to the clear sky, saying, "There is obviously nothing going on, but some people like to spread rumors... Look at this sky, it's hard to believe that there will be a war..."
    But before he could finish speaking, the sound of bombing had already answered him.
    The war of aggression immediately disrupted the peaceful lives of their families. The bourgeois rulers who usually rode on their heads had long fled in panic, leaving them exposed to the edge of the invaders' blades. Soon, reality prompted them to decide their own paths: rise up to resist, or wait to be slaughtered and enslaved? In addition, there were naturally people who surrendered to the enemy and became spies.
    Naive and simple young children could not avoid this tempering either. They originally thought that schools could have holidays after the war, but soon they came into contact with politics, encountered setbacks, and increased their knowledge. They matured early, grew up, and joined the battle with their fathers and brothers; there were also others who shamefully became enemy informants and betrayers, becoming "Hitler Youth." Here, we see that what the fascists used to poison the next generation was still chauvinism and national discrimination. The happy lives of the young children in the peaceful Warsaw street described at the beginning of the film were soon interrupted by the shadow of the national discrimination issue that runs through the entire story. The film's author grasped some extremely ordinary, everyday, and even events that happened in children's games, but were of political significance, to illustrate the universality and depth of the impact of this political issue on people's lives: Fascists used the wedge of national discrimination to drive into every street, split every house, and split every dining table, attempting to blur the class contradictions… The film's artistic expression is profound and moving.
    I believe that our audience will warmly welcome this film and will love the excellent film art of our brother country, Poland!
    We will gain vigilance from this film. We all know that following fascist Germany, fascist America has also consistently carried out national oppression and national discrimination policies, persecuting blacks and Jews. In Korea and the Philippines, the invaders are even massacring peaceful people by the thousands—the "colored people" they discriminate against. "Warsaw Street" illuminates the faces of war criminals of the same color, whether they are new or old.

　　[Note 1] New Polish films were produced during World War II. At that time, filmmakers headed by Alexander Ford (the screenwriter and director of "Warsaw Street") organized the "Military Film Team" attached to the Polish army in the Soviet Union. With the victorious advance of the Red Army and the Polish army, they filmed some documentary films. After the liberation of Poland, they began to produce more documentaries and feature films, including "Warsaw Street" and "The Last Stage," both of which have won international film awards. The latter describes the underground activities in the Auschwitz concentration camp, directed by Wanda Jakubowska, for which she received the International Peace Prize awarded by the Second World Peace Congress.

    反对法西斯的血腥的民族歧视政策
    ——波兰电影“华沙一条街”观后
    袁水拍
    八年前的今天（一九四四年七月二十二日），波兰人民开始从德国法西斯的奴役下解放出来，远在东方的、但由于共同的保卫和平的光荣事业而和我们的友人紧密联结在一起的中国人民，今天正在为我们兄弟国家的国庆日而欢欣庆贺！
    在这个时候，波兰的优秀影片之一、也是波兰共和国电影〔注一〕和中国观众首次见面的一部——“华沙一条街”的放映，是很有意义的。它将加深中国人民对波兰人民的斗争历史的了解，促进中波两国的文化交流和人民友谊，也将使我国观众进一步地普遍和深刻地认识德国法西斯的可耻面目和它的血腥罪行，加强我们对帝国主义的仇恨和对保卫和平的决心。
    让我们把这页惨痛的历史回溯一下。
    波兰是第二次世界大战中遭受破坏最烈的国家之一。在战争中，在纳粹占领期间，波兰人民被杀害了六百多万，其中三百多万是波兰籍犹太人。希特勒的、也是世界上其他帝国主义者所共有的民族高压政策和民族歧视政策，煽动了他的野兽军队进行了史无前例的残酷屠杀。根据统计，在德寇侵占以前，波兰的犹太人约共三百二十万到三百二十五万，到战争结束时还活着的，只剩四万到五万人。也就是说，幸免的只有百分之一·三或一·六。全欧洲的犹太人共九百六十一万二千人，德寇占领期间牺牲的达五百七十八万七千人，而其中一大半是波兰籍犹太人〔注二〕。这些数字多么怵目惊心！但是，在嗜杀的纳粹刽子手看来，却是“完成”了“规模宏大的行动”（德寇用语）。一九四三年四月十九日，被禁闭在华沙犹太区内的三万犹太人英勇地起义了，他们用劣势的武器，抵抗德寇大炮、坦克和飞机的疯狂轰炸。德军按照希特勒的原来计划，把整个犹太区烧光，到五月十六日，这血腥屠杀才结束。在纽伦堡审判战犯的法庭上，曾出现了这样一个证件，是华沙德军在犯了这个罪行后，打给柏林的一个报告，封面上用精致的花体美术字“夸耀”地标着：“华沙已不再有犹太人居住区存在”〔注三〕。
    在影片“华沙一条街”中，我们可以看到犹太区被毁的惨象：跟着饥饿，疾病，随意的枪杀而来的，是坦克的包围和飞机的轰炸，是逐屋的放火……妇女、老人和儿童被烧死，波兰的救火人员被德匪射杀……同时，我们也可以看到犹太人的地下军怎样英勇地顽强地对侵略者作战。在历史记载中，起义者坚持达三个星期，在抵抗的最后一天，犹太战士用波兰国旗裹着自己身子，站在燃烧着的六层楼屋顶，跳进了烈火。这样壮烈的事迹，在影片中也有类似的表现。
    犹太劳动人民同样是爱国者，同样是坚决的反法西斯战士，波兰和犹太劳动人民不应该分裂，应该紧紧团结起来向撒布民族歧视的毒菌的敌人作战——这个认识，影片告诉我们，在战争爆发前后，在一部分波兰人和波籍犹太人的头脑里，并不是清楚的，他们长期地遭受了纳粹和本国资产阶级、地主阶级的阴险的欺骗宣传的毒害。
    影片中的犹太老裁缝赖伯曼和波兰银行员华腾就代表了这样一部分人。老裁缝有着狭隘的传统观念和浓厚的宗教思想，直到面临即将被集中到犹太区去遭受屠杀的命运的时候，还误以为“把我们犹太人分开来住，或许倒好些”，他的老婆也以为“至少在犹太区，彼此都一样”。当赖伯曼关拢窗子不愿听德寇的街头广播器中的叫嚣“犹太人是卑劣的民族，是人中的败类”的时候，他痛苦，但他不了解。他仅仅以为这是又一次的民族压迫、宗教迫害，他决不会想到希特勒的反犹太主义的实质是阶级压迫，是帝国主义实行对外侵略和对内镇压劳动人民、分裂劳动人民的一种毒辣的手段。
    银行员华腾在战争爆发前夕还坚信“希特勒不敢打”，战争“是犹太人造谣言，他们好发洋财”。他告诫自己的孩子不要和犹太孩子一起游玩，认为他们是“脏孩子”。但是，战争的现实毕竟教育了他，他看到犹太人也和他一样，战争一起来就立刻参军保卫波兰，而犹太老裁缝宁愿冒着生命的危险在德寇淫威前坚定不屈，不把他——波兰人出卖给敌人。因此，华腾最后觉悟到自己“过去歧视犹太人是错误的”，并且也纠正了他孩子的同样错误的思想。
    犹太和波兰的工人阶级就不是这样。犹太电气工人纳旦和波兰马车夫沙波里古斯基并没有受到这种政治欺骗。纳旦清楚地认识法西斯“要消灭我们波兰，使我们分裂，才分开波兰人跟我们犹太人，这是他们的血腥统治政策。我们只有团结起来反抗”。当他的岳父，就是那老裁缝只是狭隘地感受到民族压迫而发出“受苦受难的犹太人啊”的叹息的时候，纳旦马上着重地重复说道：“不光是我们受苦受难，不光是我们受苦受难。”跟这个犹太电气工人同样没有种族偏见的波兰马车夫却代表了另一类型的人，他没有纳旦这样的产业工人的高度政治觉悟，他只是爱自己的国家，鄙视与愤恨侵略者，他有正义感，公然嘲笑投敌的波奸，慷慨帮助受迫害的赖伯曼一家，但他仅仅认为彼此是邻居，应该帮忙。“今天你帮他，说不定明天他帮你。”他代表着旧社会下层的正直善良的人。
    影片以简练的镜头，以切合身份的思想饱满的对话，通过了真实的生活的描写，生动地刻划了以上这些和其他人物的性格以及符合于他们的性格的行动。每一个人的形象都鲜明凸出。
    他们都是些普通的波兰人民。通过对这些普通人以及一群少年儿童的描绘，影片富有意义地反映了历史时代的一个段落。多数的他们，在资产阶级的统治下过着没有防备的分散的个人的生活，对法西斯、对战争很少认识，很少警惕。他们担心着，却又不愿意相信，战争已经在敲他们的门。即使街头广播器已经呼喊出华沙宣布了空袭警报的新闻，马车夫沙波里古斯基还是抬头指着晴空，说道：“明明没事情，偏偏有人爱造谣生事……你看看这天，说要打仗真叫人信不过……”
    但是，话还没说完，轰炸的声音已经回答了他。
    侵略战争一下子就破坏了他们家庭的和平生活，平时骑在他们头上的资产阶级统治者早已望风而逃，抛下他们暴露在侵略者的刃锋下。很快地，现实促使他们去决定各自的道路：起来反抗呢，还是等待被屠杀和奴役？此外，自然也有人投敌当了奸细。
    天真单纯的少年儿童也不能避开这个锻炼，他们本来还以为，打了仗学校可以放假，但很快地他们接触到政治，遭遇挫折，增长了知识。他们早熟了，成长了，跟着他们的父兄投入了战斗；也有另外的一些，可耻地变为敌人的暗探和告密者，当了“希特勒少年团”。在这里，我们看见法西斯用来毒害下一代的，仍旧是沙文主义和民族歧视。影片在开始所描写的和平的华沙街头的少年儿童们的愉快生活，不久就被这个贯穿整个故事的民族歧视问题的阴影所打断。影片作者抓住了一些极平凡的，日常生活中的，甚至是发生在儿童游戏当中的，然而是有政治意义的事件，说明了这个政治问题在人们生活中的影响的普遍性和深刻性：法西斯用民族歧视的尖劈来楔入每一条街道，分裂每一座房子，劈开每一张餐桌，而企图把阶级的对立模糊起来……影片的这样的艺术的表现方法，是深刻的、动人的。
    我相信，我国的观众将会热烈欢迎这部影片，将会爱好我们的兄弟国家波兰的优秀的电影艺术！
    从这部影片我们将获得警惕。我们都知道，继法西斯德国之后，法西斯的美国，也一贯进行着民族高压和民族歧视政策，迫害黑人和犹太人。在朝鲜，在菲律宾，侵略者更成千成万地屠杀着和平人民——他们所歧视的“有色人种”。“华沙一条街”照出了战犯们的一色的脸谱，不管他是新的还是旧的。
　　〔注一〕新波兰电影是在第二次大战中产生的。当时以亚力山大·福特（即“华沙一条街”的编剧兼导演）为首的电影工作者们组织了“随军电影队”附属在苏联境内的波兰军队中，随着红军和波军的胜利进军，他们摄制了一些纪录影片。波兰解放后，才开始摄制更多的纪录片和故事片，其中“华沙一条街”和“最后阶段”都获得过国际电影奖。后者描写了奥斯威辛集中营中的地下活动，导演为璜达·约柯勃斯卡，为此，她获得了第二届保卫世界和平大会所颁的国际和平奖金。
