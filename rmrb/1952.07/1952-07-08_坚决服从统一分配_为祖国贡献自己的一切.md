    Resolutely Obey Unified Assignment, Dedicate Everything to the Motherland
    To the Editor: We are about to graduate. We thank the people of the motherland for nurturing us, and we thank the Party and Chairman Mao for educating us. Just as we are graduating, the motherland is beginning large-scale construction. What an exciting thing this is!
    "People's Teacher," what a glorious title that is so respected and loved! However, in the past, some individual students in our school believed that being a teacher had no future. When we went to the countryside for internships and saw the rapid development of education in the vast rural areas and small and medium-sized cities of the motherland, and the eagerness of the children of the emancipated peasants to go to school, we felt our responsibility was even greater. Therefore, when some students were transferred to educational work positions ahead of schedule, they all happily obeyed the organization's assignment. They said, "When we go to work, we must strive to be excellent people's teachers." Other students wrote and said, "When we think that we are here to serve the needs of the motherland, how happy is our work!"
    When we visited Dalian and Lushun, we saw the teachers there working selflessly and humbly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in educating students. Their work spirit educated us and also strengthened our professional ideals.
    Now we are about to graduate. On the occasion of commemorating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, we have written to Chairman Mao, firmly stating: "The students of Hebei Normal College will obey the allocation of the people of the motherland 100% unconditionally and will happily take up the work of people's teachers." We will use such practical actions to repay the Party for its education.
    Please tell the students of other normal schools to let us gloriously meet in the positions of the motherland's cultural and educational work! We firmly believe that this is our common wish and also the hope of the people of the motherland for us. Finally, let us shout: Dedicate everything to the motherland's cultural and educational cause!
    The Entire Graduating Class of Hebei Normal College

    坚决服从统一分配　为祖国贡献自己的一切
    编辑同志：我们就要毕业了。我们感谢祖国人民对我们的培养，感谢党和毛主席对我们的教育。正当我们毕业的时候，祖国开始大规模的建设。这是多么值得兴奋的事啊！
    “人民教师”，这是多么受人尊敬和爱戴的一个光荣称号！然而过去在我们学校里，还有个别的同学认为做教师是没有前途的。我们下乡实习，看到了祖国广大农村和中小城市人民教育事业的迅速发展；以及农民翻身以后，他们的子女迫切要求入学的情况，就越发感到自己的责任重大了。所以，当部分同学被提前调到教育工作岗位的时候，他们都愉快地服从了组织的分配。他们说：“到工作岗位上去，一定要争取做个优秀的人民教师。”还有同学来信说：“当我们想到自己是服从祖国需要而来的时候，我们的工作是多么愉快呢？”
    我们到旅大参观的时候，看到那里的教师在忘我地工作，虚心地学习苏联的先进经验教育学生。他们这种工作精神，教育了我们，同时也巩固了我们的专业思想。
    目前我们就要毕业了。在纪念中国共产党诞生三十一周年的时候，我们已经写信给毛主席，坚决表示：“我们河北师范学院的同学，百分之百地无条件地服从祖国人民的分配，一定愉快地走上人民教师的工作岗位。”我们就用这样的实际行动来报答党对我们的教育。
    请你告诉其他师范学校的同学们，让我们在祖国文化教育工作的岗位上光荣地会师吧！我们坚信这是我们共同的愿望，也是祖国人民对我们的希望。最后让我们高呼：为祖国文化教育事业贡献出自己的一切吧！    河北师范学院全体毕业同学
