    Saluting the Heroic Struggle of the Japanese People
    Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the people of Japan are waging a heroic struggle against the American aggressors and their running dogs, the Japanese reactionaries, for the independence, freedom, peace, and democracy of their motherland. This year, on May Day, four million Japanese people held celebrations and demonstrations in more than 480 locations across the country, severely striking the American and Japanese reactionaries and fully demonstrating the strength of the Japanese people and the high tide of the revolutionary movement. This is a corner of the May Day celebration assembly held by 500,000 working people of Tokyo at the Meiji Jingu Gaien Plaza.
    At the forefront of the May Day demonstration parade of 500,000 people in Tokyo, people marched forward, holding high the portrait of their leader, Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party.
    The American and Japanese reactionaries illegally prohibited the May Day celebration assembly from being held in People's Square. The Tokyo working people's celebration assembly was moved to Meiji Jingu Gaien Plaza. During the assembly, the masses unanimously demanded: "Go to People's Square!" After the assembly, 500,000 people held demonstrations in five routes. Among them, 100,000 demonstrators, disregarding the bloody suppression by the American and Japanese reactionaries, rushed towards People's Square.
    On May Day, American officers in Tokyo directed 10,000 Japanese armed police, using pistols, tear gas, and batons, to attack the Japanese people's demonstration entering People's Square. The demonstrators resolutely fought back against the police with flagpoles, banners, and other items.
    This is the workers' contingent participating in the May Day demonstration parade in Tokyo, holding high banners that read "Protect Our Peaceful Industries with Our Own Hands!" and "Oppose Aggressive War!"
    Women participating in the May Day demonstration parade in Tokyo, holding banners that read "Oppose War," march forward.
    In the May Day demonstration parade in Tokyo, people participating in the demonstration march forward with white headbands bearing the slogan "Oppose War."
    In the six or seven years since the war, American aggressors have been cruelly enslaving and persecuting the Japanese people. The Japanese people's boundless hatred has erupted into the flames of national resistance, and the anti-American struggle has risen increasingly. This is the car of the American invading forces' headquarters that was burned during the fight between the Japanese people's demonstrators and the Japanese armed police directed by American officers on May Day in Tokyo.
    On June 6th this year, people in Tokyo held a rally at Hibiya Public Hall to commemorate the second anniversary of the Japanese Communist Party leaders being illegally "purged" by the American and Japanese reactionaries. More than 5,000 people attended the rally, and more than 20 members of the Japanese Communist Party's Diet delivered speeches. After the meeting, a demonstration was held. The demonstrators sang "The Internationale" and shouted slogans such as "Yankee Go Home!" and "Down with the Yoshida Government, Puppet of American Imperialism!" This is the scene of the commemorative meeting in progress.

    向英勇斗争的日本人民致敬
    在日本共产党的领导下，日本全国人民为了祖国的独立、自由、和平与民主，正向美国侵略者及其走狗日本反动派进行英勇的斗争。今年五一劳动节，日本人民四百万人在全国四百八十余处举行了庆祝大会和示威游行，严重地打击了美、日反动派，充分地显出了日本人民力量的强大和革命运动的高涨。这是东京市劳动人民五十万人在明治神宫外苑广场举行庆祝五一劳动节大会会场的一角。
    在东京市五十万人民庆祝五一劳动节示威游行队伍的最前面，人们高举着自己的领袖——日本共产党中央委员会总书记德田球一的画像大步前进。
    美、日反动派非法禁止在人民广场举行庆祝五一劳动节大会，东京市日本劳动人民的庆祝大会改在明治神宫外苑广场举行。大会中，群众一致要求：“到人民广场去！”会后，五十万人分五路举行了示威游行。其中十万示威群众，不顾美、日反动派的血腥镇压，冲向人民广场。
    五一劳动节，东京市的美国军官指挥着一万名日本武装警察，用手枪、催泪瓦斯弹和警棍等向进入人民广场的日本人民示威队伍进攻，示威群众即以旗杆、标语牌等坚决向警察还击。
    这是参加东京市庆祝五一劳动节示威游行的工人队伍，他们高举着“用我们的双手保护我们的和平工业！”“反对侵略战争！”等标语牌前进。
    参加东京市庆祝五一劳动节示威游行的妇女们举着“反对战争”等标语牌前进。
    在东京市庆祝五一劳动节的示威游行队伍中，参加示威游行的人们，头上包着写有“反对战争”口号的白手巾前进。
    战后六、七年来，美国侵略者对日本人民进行着残酷的奴役与迫害，日本人民无尽的仇恨爆发为民族反抗的怒火，反美的斗争日益高涨。这是五一劳动节东京市日本人民的示威群众和美国军官指挥的日本武装警察搏斗时被烧毁的美国侵略军总部的汽车。
    今年六月六日，东京市人民在日比谷公会堂举行大会，纪念两年前日本共产党领袖被美日反动派非法的“整肃”。参加大会者达五千余人，日本共产党国会议员二十余人发表了演说，会后举行了示威游行，示威群众高唱“国际歌”，并高呼“美国兵滚回去！”“打倒美帝国主义傀儡吉田政府！”等口号。这是纪念大会进行中的情形。
