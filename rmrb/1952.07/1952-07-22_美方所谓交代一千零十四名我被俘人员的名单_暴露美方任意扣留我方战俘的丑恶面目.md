Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th - The chief US representative, Harrison, submitted a list "accounting for" 1,014 Chinese POWs to our side's General Nan Ri on July 17th after repeated questioning from our side. This list, full of loopholes, exposes the ugly truth of the US side's arbitrary detention of our POWs.

Originally, our side submitted a list of 1,014 of our POWs on April 4th, requesting an explanation from the US side. The list submitted by our side was divided into three parts. The first part consisted of 182 people, whom the US side had failed to account for in past submissions of POW lists by using the egregious method of substituting one person's name for two. In this "explanation," the US side vaguely stated that these people, who had appeared twice on the same POW list, were "being detained as POWs," thus avoiding the issue of one person substituting for two, and still failing to explain who the substituted person was.

The second part consisted of 780 people, none of whom were mentioned in the POW materials provided by the US side, yet family letters had reached our region. This time, the US side admitted that 366 of them were indeed in their POW camps. Judging from their "detention numbers," they were not recent captives. Why were they not accounted for in the previous POW lists? This shows that the US side had the intention of detaining POWs from the very beginning. As for the remaining 414 people, Harrison evaded the question, claiming that the "detention numbers did not match the names."

The third part consisted of 52 people, whose names were inked out in the mimeographed list when the US side first submitted the English version of our POW list on December 18th of last year. However, when the US side resubmitted the Korean version of our POW list on December 23rd of last year, they forgot to ink out these names. And on January 28th of this year, when the US side submitted the POW units and ranks that should have been submitted earlier for the third time, these names were simply removed. People are very curious, what does this mean? Harrison replied on July 17th that thirteen of these people had "escaped." The dates of the "escapes" were sometime in March or April of this year. What an "escape"! So that's it! It turns out that the Harrisons knew as early as December of last year and January of this year, that is, three or four months earlier, that these people would "escape" in three or four months, and therefore crossed their names out in the lists submitted to our side on December 18th and January 28th!

The truth is this: US generals successively pulled away a large number of our POWs in mid-December of last year and sent them to US intelligence schools in Tokyo for training. They were then sent to intelligence agencies in Seoul, where they were forced to become US military spies. Therefore, the US generals crossed their names out in the two lists on December 18th of last year and January 28th of this year. Among the thirteen people who Harrison claimed had "escaped," several have already confessed to our side after being airdropped into our region, detailing their experiences of being forced to serve as US military spies, and describing and confirming the inhumane and bloody crimes committed by the US imperialist bandits against our POWs in the POW camps.

Judging from the above ironclad facts, the US side's methods of detaining POWs are basically twofold: one is overt, called "voluntary repatriation," using the false pretense that POWs "do not wish to be repatriated" to carry out the actual detention of large numbers of POWs. The other is covert, simply crossing out some names on the POW list, or simply concealing them without reporting. When our side submits a specific list requesting an explanation, they use all kinds of unreasonable excuses, claiming "not to know" or avoiding answering. But with witnesses and material evidence available, how can they deny it? Then comes a "voluntary repatriation." In short, if overt methods don't work, they use covert ones; if covert methods don't work, they use overt ones again. The methods may be different: sometimes it is called "voluntary repatriation," sometimes it is called "escape," but the purpose of creating spies and cannon fodder for the Li and Chiang bandit gangs is the same.

    美方所谓交代一千零十四名我被俘人员的名单
    暴露美方任意扣留我方战俘的丑恶面目
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方首席代表哈利逊在我方多次追问之下于七月十七日向我方南日将军提交了一份“交代”一千零十四名我方被俘人员的名单。这份漏洞百出的名单暴露了美方任意扣留我方战俘的丑恶的真面目。
    原来，我方曾于四月四日提出我方被俘人员一千零十四人名单一份，要求美方交代。我方提出的名单共分三部分。第一部分有一八二人，是美方在过去提交我方的战俘名单中用一个人的名字来顶替两个人的恶劣手法而没有交代的。美方在这一次“交代”中，把这些曾在同一份战俘名单中出现两次的人含糊其词地说是“作为一个战俘而被拘留”，这样就避开了一个人顶替两个人的问题，对被顶替者究系何人仍未交代。
    第二部分有七百八十人，都是美方交来战俘材料中所没有的，但是竟有家信寄至我方地区。这一次美方承认了其中三百六十六人确在他们的战俘营中。从这些人的“拘留号码”来看都不是新近被俘的，为什么在过去的战俘名单中不交代呢？这表明美方早就有了扣留战俘的意图。对其余的四百一十四人，哈利逊竟以“拘留号码与人名不相符合”为理由而避不交代。
    第三部分有五十二人，是美方在去年十二月十八日第一次提交英文本的我方战俘名单时在油印本的名单中用墨笔加以涂去，但在去年十二月二十三日第二次美方补交朝中文的我方战俘名单时忘了加以涂去的。而在今年一月二十八日第三次美方补交早应交出的战俘部别和级别时，又根本去掉了这些名字。人们很奇怪，这到底是什么意思呢？哈利逊于七月十七日答复说，这中间有十三个人“逃亡”了。“逃亡”的日期，有的在今年三月份，有的在今年四月份。好一个“逃亡”！原来如此！哈利逊们竟可以在去年十二月间和今年一月间，也就是说在三、四个月以前就知道这些人在三、四个月以后将要“逃亡”，因而在十二月十八日以及一月二十八日两次提交我方的名单中就把他们的名字一笔勾消！
    事实是这样的：美国将军们在去年十二月中旬先后在我方被俘人员中间拉走了一大批人，送到东京美国特务学校受训，然后派到汉城特务机关，强迫他们当美军的特务。因此，美国将军们就在去年十二月十八日和今年一月二十八日两次名单中把他们的名字勾掉。哈利逊所谓“逃亡”的十三人中，已经有多名在被空投至我方地区后，向我方坦白了他们被迫充当美军特务的经过，并且详细地叙述和证实了美帝国主义强盗在战俘营向我方被俘人员所施行的惨无人道的血腥罪行。
    从以上铁的事实看来，美方扣留战俘的手法基本上有两种：一种是明的，叫做“自愿遣返”，假战俘“不愿遣返”之名，行大批扣留战俘之实。一种是暗的，索性用笔在战俘名单上把一些名字涂掉，或者索性隐瞒不报，而当我方提出具体名单要求交代时，竟用种种无理托词推说“不知道”或避不答覆。但是人证物证俱在，何容抵赖？于是就来一个“自愿遣返”。总之，明的不成用暗的，暗的不成再用明的。做法可以有不同：有的时候称为“自愿遣返”，有的时候称为“逃亡”，其为李、蒋匪帮制造特务和炮灰的目的则一。
