    Editor's note: Implementing the Sudnitsyn dispatching method is the most effective way to thoroughly implement a tight timetable. The Changchun Railway's Shenyang Branch has implemented the Sudnitsyn dispatching method, comprehensively reforming dispatching work, thereby improving the utilization efficiency of locomotives and rolling stock. In order to further promote the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, all railway bureaus should conscientiously study and implement this advanced dispatching method.

    The Changchun Railway's Shenyang Branch, in the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, implemented the Sudnitsyn dispatching method, which improved the utilization efficiency of locomotives and rolling stock.

    The Sudnitsyn dispatching method comprehensively reformed the dispatching work. The old dispatching method was determined by the old operating system, and the old train timetable was rigid. Trains ran according to the timetable, not allowed to run fast, not allowed to depart early. Even if the work was completed ahead of schedule at intermediate stations, they had to wait until the scheduled time to depart; being five minutes ahead of schedule was considered an accident. Dispatchers only drew lines and recorded times on the timetable, rigidly maintaining trains on schedule, never adjusting the train operation. The timetable controlled the dispatcher; the dispatcher was merely a recorder, not a planner or commander, let alone an organizer of train operations.

    The People's Railway adopted the socialist advanced new operating system, broke the old regulations, and adopted a new timetable. Under the principle of safe operation, trains that could pass without stopping did so, and trains that could avoid taking on water did so, trying to make trains run as fast as possible. Based on this principle, the Shenyang Branch made some partial improvements to the dispatching work. For example, it combined the train dispatching work and the rolling stock dispatching work so that the dispatcher had to adjust the train operation, and began to pay attention to improving the efficiency of rolling stock utilization. However, these partial improvements still did not comprehensively reform the dispatching work, and could not greatly improve the utilization efficiency of locomotives and rolling stock. The main reason was that in the past, when making plans, the connection between the branches was not sufficient. Therefore, the estimation of the actual traffic flow was not accurate. Daily plans were based only on experience and estimates, and often 90 percent of them could not be realized. Because the daily plan was not accurate, it resulted in trains not being able to connect at the boundary lines, too many extra and deadhead train runs, and the dispatching department creating empty train runs and stockpiling locomotives for emergency use, resulting in wasted locomotives. Especially after the launch of the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, the transportation department often blamed the locomotive department for only emphasizing the locomotive utilization rate and affecting the rolling stock turnover rate; the locomotive department believed that taking care of the rolling stock turnover rate would waste locomotives. The relationship between them was not good. Furthermore, since the overall transportation performance was reflected in the rolling stock turnover rate, the train dispatcher became less concerned about the utilization of locomotives. Locomotive crews wanted to run fast, but were kept at turnaround stations for long periods of time. They wanted to run over-axle, but sometimes they pulled less than the full axle, even not enough vehicles. These phenomena greatly hindered the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement. Before the Shenyang Branch implemented the Sudnitsyn dispatching method, the daily locomotive kilometer was only 423.5 kilometers.

    The Sudnitsyn dispatching method is a comprehensive dispatching method that masters both train operation and locomotive utilization. It was created by Comrade Sudnitsyn, a dispatcher from the Minsk Branch of the Western Railway in the Soviet Union, during the five-hundred-kilometer movement on Soviet railways. Its characteristic is that the train dispatcher must not only master train operation and rolling stock utilization, but also cooperate with the locomotive dispatcher to master locomotive utilization, so that the utilization efficiency of rolling stock and locomotives can be improved simultaneously. The Sudnitsyn dispatching method gives full play to the planning nature of dispatching work. It makes three different timetables—maximum, medium, and minimum—based on the conditions of neighboring railway bureaus, the operating capacity of each marshalling station, and the flow of freight. Then, every ten days, it selects a timetable with an appropriate scheme based on the transportation plan. This makes the plan accurate, so that when adjusting trains, it is possible to take care of both sides. For example, when adding a train, it is possible to plan to free up a locomotive in use to pull the extra train, so as to avoid the phenomenon of trains waiting for locomotives. Because the plan is accurate, it makes the arrival times of trains match well, and each train can connect with each other, which also avoids the phenomenon of locomotives waiting for trains. But doing these tasks well is not something that the dispatcher can do alone. It is necessary to unite and act together with the relevant personnel on site. Therefore, the Sudnitsyn dispatching method also pays attention to the implementation of a broad joint labor organization. For example, the train dispatcher and relevant operating personnel—station and locomotive depot duty officers—implement the same shift system. The train dispatcher must cooperate with the locomotive dispatcher to master the utilization of locomotives.

    Last October, the Shenyang Branch, with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Orinnik, piloted the Sudnitsyn dispatching method. At the beginning of the pilot, some dispatchers said: "This method is good, but the conditions of the Shenyang Branch are not good, and I'm afraid it cannot be implemented." Some said: "It's impossible to make the daily plan accurate." The young dispatcher Zhang Diankui did not think so. He believed in the superiority of the Sudnitsyn dispatching method. He was the first to implement it. He said: "If there are difficulties, we can overcome them. If the daily plan is not accurate, we can find a way to make it accurate!" The Shenyang Branch then decided to let Zhang Diankui pilot it first. When piloting, the work of the daily plan was strengthened first. When making the daily plan, dispatching director Sun Xiancai took the initiative to contact the neighboring railway branches, knew in advance the train numbers, times, and types of vehicles arriving at the Shenyang Branch, and then determined the train operation plan based on the transportation capacity and operating conditions of each marshalling station and boundary station of the Shenyang Branch. In order to ensure that the daily plan could be realized, they also signed transportation guarantee contracts and established a regular contact system with neighboring railway branches. Therefore, the accuracy of the daily plan reached 80 percent.

    Because the daily plan became more accurate, the planning nature of dispatching work was strengthened, and the utilization efficiency of trains and locomotives was improved. In the third month after the pilot, the daily locomotive kilometer was increased to 435.7 kilometers. However, dispatchers who did not implement this dispatching method could not improve the daily locomotive kilometer, which caused dissatisfaction among the crews. After the launch of the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, the old dispatching method could no longer meet the new requirements. Therefore, in May of this year, the Shenyang Branch fully implemented the Sudnitsyn dispatching method. The daily kilometer of the entire branch increased from 430.3 kilometers in the first month of the pilot to 500.2 kilometers. In June of this year, the daily kilometer reached 508.1 kilometers.

    After the successful implementation of the Sudnitsyn dispatching method by the Shenyang Branch, other railway bureaus in Northeast China also began to implement it. Now it has been fully promoted on the Changchun Railway, and the Qiqihar Railway Administration, the Jilin Railway Administration, and the Andong Railway Branch have also begun to learn and promote it. Many facts have proven that the implementation of the Sudnitsyn dispatching method has a huge role in promoting the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement.

    沈阳铁路分局实行苏德尼果夫调度法
    张金昌  王宝星
    编者按：实行苏德尼果夫调度法是彻底实行紧密运行图最有效的方法。中长路沈阳分局实行了苏德尼果夫调度法，全面地改革调度工作，因而提高了机车和车辆的运用效率。为了进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，各铁路局应该认真学习和实行这个先进的调度方法。
    中长路沈阳分局在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，实行了苏德尼果夫调度法，提高了机车和车辆的运用效率。
    苏德尼果夫调度法全面改革了调度工作。旧的调度方法是由旧的行车制度所决定的，而旧的列车运行图是死的。列车按照运行图行车，不许快跑，不许早开，在中间站即使提前完成作业，也得等到正点才能开车，抢点五分钟就算事故。调度员只在运行图上画线、记钟点，死板地保持列车定点，从来也不调整列车的运行。运行图支配着调度员，调度员只是一个记录员，不是计划员和指挥员，更不是行车的组织者。
    人民铁路采用了社会主义先进的新行车制度，打破了旧的规章，曾采用一种新的运行图，在行车安全原则下，可以不停车的不停，可以不上水的不上水，尽量使列车快跑。根据这个原则，沈阳分局曾把调度工作作了部分的改进，比如把行车调度工作和配车调度工作合一起来，这样，调度员就得调整列车的运行，开始注意车辆运用效率的提高。但是这些部分的改进，仍然没有全面地改革调度工作，还不能大大地提高机车和车辆的运用效率。其中主要原因，就是过去作计划时，由于各分局间联系不够，因此，实际车流情况的估计不准确，作日计划只凭经验估计，往往有百分之九十不能兑现。由于日计划不准确，所以造成列车在分界线上不能衔接、加开和运休车次太多，以及调度部门造空头车次，储备机车准备急用等浪费机车的现象。特别是展开满载超轴五百公里运动后，车务部门时常责怪机务部门只强调机车运用率而影响车辆运转率；机务部门则认为照顾车辆运转率就会浪费机车。彼此关系不好，再加上运输总成绩是表现在车辆周转率上，更促使行车调度不关心机车的运用，机车乘务员想快跑，但却被长时间留在折返站上；想超轴，但有时拉的不能满轴，甚至拉不到车辆。这种种现象，大大地阻碍了满载超轴五百公里运动。沈阳分局在实行苏德尼果夫调度法以前，机车日车公里只有四百二十三点五公里。
    苏德尼果夫调度法，是掌握列车运行和机车运用的综合调度法。这是在苏联铁路五百公里运动中，西方铁路明斯克分局调度员苏德尼果夫同志创造的。它的特点是：行车调度员不但要掌握列车运行和车辆运用，而且要配合机车调度员掌握机车的运用，因此可以同时提高车辆和机车的运用效率。苏德尼果夫调度法充分发挥了调度工作的计划性，它根据邻近的各铁路局的情况、各编组站的作业能力和货流情况，作出最大、中等、最小三种不同的运行图，然后每旬根据运输计划，选择适当方案的运行图，这就可以使得计划准确，在调整列车时，就可以彼此兼顾。比如在加开一次列车时，就能有计划地把运用中的机车腾出一台来，率引加开的列车，以避免列车等待机车的现象。因为计划准确，所以也就可以使得列车到达时间配合得好，各次列车能够互相衔接，因而也可避免机车等待列车的现象。但作好这些工作，决不是调度员一个人所能做到的，必须和现场有关人员联合一起，共同行动。因此，苏德尼果夫调度法又注意了实行广泛的联合劳动组织。比如行车调度员和有关行车人员——车站、机务段值班人员，实行同样的上下班制度，行车调度员必须配合机车调度员，掌握机车的运用。
    去年十月，沈阳分局在苏联专家奥林尼克同志的帮助下，试行苏德尼果夫调度法。在开始试行时，有的调度员说：“这个办法好是好，可是沈阳分局的条件不好，怕实行不了。”有的说：“做日计划，怎么样也不能准确。”青年调度员张殿魁却不这样想，他相信苏德尼果夫调度法的优越性，他首先实行。他说：“有困难，我们可以克服。日计划不准确，我们可以想办法让它准确！”沈阳分局遂决定先由张殿魁来试行。试行时，首先加强了日计划的工作。调度主任孙仙材做日计划时，主动地和邻近的各铁路分局联系，预先知道到达沈阳分局的车次、时间和车种，再根据沈阳分局各编组站和分界站的运输能力和作业情况，来确定列车运行计划。为了使得日计划得以兑现，又和邻近的铁路分局订立了运输保证合同和经常性的联系制度。因此，日计划的准确程度就达到了百分之八十。
    由于日计划趋于准确，因而就加强了调度工作的计划性，提高了列车和机车的运用效率。在试行后的第三个月，就把机车日车公里提高到四百三十五点七公里。但没有实行这个调度法的调度员，不能提高机车日车公里，引起了乘务员的不满。在开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动以后，旧的调度方法，更不能满足新的要求了。因此在今年五月，沈阳分局全面实行了苏德尼果夫调度法，全分局的日车公里由试行的第一个月的四百三十点三公里提高到五百零点二公里，今年六月，日车公里达到了五百零八点一公里。
    沈阳分局实行苏德尼果夫调度法成功以后，东北其他各铁路局也开始实行。现在中长路已全面推行，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局、吉林铁路管理局和安东铁路分局也开始学习和推行。许多事实证明：实行苏德尼果夫调度法，对于开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动有巨大的作用。
