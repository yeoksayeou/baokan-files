    The East China Military and Political Committee Issues Emergency Call for Drought Prevention and Relief
    Anhui and Northern Jiangsu Regions Launch Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection Campaign
    Since June, most areas of East China, with the exception of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, have experienced little rainfall. Although Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu provinces received some rain after June 27th, the drought situation in already affected areas has not improved. In the Wuhu and Anqing regions south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River, 30 to 50 percent of the land has not been sown. In the Taizhou region of northern Jiangsu, in counties such as Yizheng and Liuhe, and in the Maoshan mountainous area of southern Jiangsu, 500,000 to 600,000 mu of rice paddies cannot be transplanted due to lack of water. To address this, the East China Military and Political Committee issued an "Emergency Directive on Strengthening Drought Resistance, Drought Prevention, and Seedling Protection Work" on July 1st. The directive stated: Mobilizing the masses to resolutely overcome the threat of summer drought is a crucial key to achieving a good autumn harvest in East China. It demanded that local people's governments in severely drought-stricken areas concentrate their efforts and lead farmers in doing a good job in drought resistance, planting, and seedling protection. Areas that have received rain and where the drought has initially eased should lead farmers in a concentrated effort to replant seedlings, rush planting, diligently weed, and conserve soil moisture. Areas not affected by drought should also make all necessary preparations for drought prevention. Local people's governments should also carefully inspect flood prevention and drainage preparations and intensify efforts to eliminate pests.
    The directive also pointed out that the basic measures for drought prevention are to develop water sources, conserve water, and improve farming techniques. All regions should transform this struggle into the central content of the patriotic production increase competition movement, actively launching a sprint competition for drought resistance, drought prevention, rush planting, seedling protection, and pest control in rural areas.
    Currently, the people's governments of drought-stricken areas are actively mobilizing farmers to carry out drought resistance and seedling protection efforts. After the Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued instructions, many drought relief command organizations in Wuhu and other places moved their offices to the embankments. In addition to intensive planting, the Zibo region of Shandong also mobilized farmers to repair old wells and dig new wells, utilizing all available water sources to carry out drought relief efforts.

    People's governments at all levels in Anhui Province are vigorously leading farmers to launch drought prevention, drought resistance, rush planting, and seedling protection campaigns. Although the six regions of Wuhu, Chuxian, and Suxian, which suffered from relatively severe summer drought, received rainfall in late June, the drought has not been completely relieved, especially in areas north of the Yangtze River and south of the Huai River, where the drought is still relatively severe. In Wuwei County alone, more than 4,000 ponds have dried up, and 120,000 mu of land is affected by drought.
    In order to lead farmers in doing a good job in drought prevention, drought resistance, rush planting, and seedling protection, the Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui People's Administrative Office, as well as the people's governments of various regions and counties, have dispatched a large number of cadres to organize inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of drought prevention and resistance work in various places in conjunction with flood control and other tasks. Zhang Shirong, Secretary of the Wuhu Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yang Jun, Deputy Commissioner of the Wuhu Prefectural Office, personally went to severely drought-stricken areas to supervise and inspect drought relief work. Many production and drought relief command headquarters in districts and townships have moved their offices to the embankments. As a result, drought resistance, sowing, and seedling protection campaigns have been rapidly launched in various places. The Wuhu region has mobilized more than 100,000 farmers, using more than 30,000 waterwheels day and night to draw water, saving more than 128,000 mu of drought-stricken rice paddies. The Chuxian region also mobilized farmers to draw water to irrigate more than 80,000 mu of drought-stricken fields. Farmers in various places have also adopted methods such as digging ditches to divert water and weeding more frequently to carry out rush planting and seedling protection. Farmers in Shuangbai Township, Shouxian County, dug ditches to divert water to irrigate more than 2,000 mu of rice paddies. Farmers in Huayuan Township, Feixi County, under the slogan "Three parts of water under the hoe," tilled the 900 mu of dry land in the entire township two more times. In order to prevent the development of drought, the people's governments in various places have also paid attention to inspecting and guiding farmers to repair substandard ponds and dams, establishing and improving water management institutions for ponds and dams, and implementing methods of water conservation and rational water use. Various places in the Wuhu region have advocated the use of idle water from mountain gullies and depressions first, and sharing water from fields with more water to fields with less water, in order to conserve pond water; or implementing shallow and frequent irrigation methods. Xuancheng County, due to good democratic management of ponds and dams, generally has 70% of water stored in the ponds and dams. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The Northern Jiangsu Region has launched a mass drought resistance and seedling protection campaign, and farmers in various places are using various methods suited to local conditions to fight the drought.
    Most areas of Northern Jiangsu have not had rain for nearly a month, and the drought is severe in some areas. There is a shortage of water in the mountainous areas for transplanting rice seedlings, and the transplanted rice paddies in the plains lack water for irrigation. Dryland crops such as sorghum and corn are also affected by the drought, with leaves curling up and turning yellow. The Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office convened a drought relief meeting in late June. Under the leadership of the people's governments, farmers in various places have vigorously developed water sources and diverted water for irrigation according to different geographical conditions. Farmers in dryland areas have been actively digging wells and ponds to use groundwater for irrigation. Farmers in the Qinnan District of Yancheng County dug 21 small rivers and 8 ditches at the end of June, enabling 20,000 mu of fields to be irrigated. Shuyang County has dug 1,100 wells throughout the county. Farmers in the Weiji District of Suining County dug 240 wells, solving the problem of water for planting sweet potatoes in the entire district. In areas where the groundwater level is low, it is not easy to dig ponds on flat ground without water seepage, so farmers dig ponds and wells in dried-up rivers and ditches. Yizheng and Liuhe mountainous areas have organized manpower and animal power to carry water up the mountains for irrigation. In areas where rivers can be used for irrigation, farmers are building dams to block and divert water for irrigation. In Rudong County, 625 laborers were organized from four townships including Yan'gang and Changsha in the Qizhen District to build 102 water-blocking dams, concentrating 66 waterwheels to draw and splash water day and night, filling enough pond water to irrigate 850 mu of rice paddies.
    Mutual aid teams have played a significant role in promoting the drought resistance and seedling protection struggle in the Northern Jiangsu Region. The Mao Changfa mutual aid team in Naixi Village, Qianjin Township, Rudong County, organized six water-pushing teams, each team taking turns to push water for two hours each day, solving the problem of water shortage for the team's 96 mu of rice paddies in six days, reversing the pessimistic wait-for-rain mentality of nearby farmers and enabling them to organize themselves to push water to protect seedlings.

    华东军政委员会紧急号召防旱抗旱
    安徽、苏北地区开展抗旱保苗运动
    华东地区六月以来，除浙江、福建两省外，大部地区雨量稀少。六月二十七日以后，山东、皖北、苏北等地虽下过一场雨，但已呈旱象的地区仍未好转。淮河以南长江以北的芜湖、安庆等专区，尚有百分之三十到五十的土地未下种。苏北泰州专区的仪征、六合等县和苏南茅山山区还有五、六十万亩稻田因缺水插不上秧。为此，华东军政委员会在七月一日即发出“关于加强抗旱防旱抢种保苗工作的紧急指示”。指示指出：发动群众坚决战胜夏旱威胁，是华东地区争取秋季丰收的重要关键。要求旱象严重的地区，各级人民政府应集中全力、领导农民做好抗旱、点种、保苗工作。已经下雨、旱象初步减轻的地区，应领导农民突击补苗、抢种、勤锄、保墒。不旱的地区也需做好一切防旱准备。各地人民政府同时还需认真检查防汛、防涝的准备工作，加紧扑灭虫害。
    指示并指出：防旱的基本措施是要开发水源、节约用水和改进耕作技术。各地应把这一斗争，变为爱国增产竞赛运动的中心内容，在农村中积极展开抗旱、防旱、抢种、保苗、治虫的突击竞赛。
    目前，发生旱象的地区人民政府已在积极动员农民进行抗旱、保苗斗争。皖南、皖北防汛抗旱指挥部发出指示后，芜湖等地好多抗旱指挥机关都已搬到堤坝上办公。山东淄博专区除突击点种外，又发动农民修旧井、凿新井，利用一切可利用的水源，展开抗旱运动。（新华社）
    安徽地区各级人民政府正大力领导农民展开防旱、抗旱、抢种、保苗运动。夏旱较重的芜湖、滁县、宿县等六个专区，虽在六月下旬都先后落了雨，但旱象还未完全解除，特别是长江以北淮河以南地区旱象至今仍较严重，仅无为县即有四千多口塘干枯无水，有十二万亩田受旱。
    为领导农民作好防旱、抗旱、抢种、保苗工作，皖南、皖北人民行政公署和各专区、县人民政府都抽调大批干部组织了检查组，结合防汛等工作，深入检查各地的防旱抗旱工作。中共芜湖地委书记张世荣和芜湖专署副专员杨钧等都亲自到受旱严重地区督促和检查抗旱工作。许多区、乡的生产抗旱指挥部都迁到堤坝上办公。各地抗旱播种保苗运动因而迅速展开。芜湖专区便发动了十万多农民，用三万多辆水车日夜汲水，使十二万八千多亩受旱秧田庄稼得救。滁县专区也发动农民汲水灌溉了八万多亩受旱田。各地农民还采取开沟引水、多锄草等办法，进行抢种、护苗。寿县双白乡农民就挖沟引水灌溉了两千多亩稻田。肥西县花园乡农民在“锄头底下三分水”的口号下，把全乡九百多亩旱地多锄了两遍。为预防旱象发展，各地人民政府并注意检查和领导农民整修不合标准的塘坝，建立与健全塘坝使水管理机构，实行节约用水和合理用水的办法。芜湖专区各地都提倡先用山沟和洼地里的闲水，水多的田匀水给水少的田，以保存塘水；或是实行浅灌勤灌的办法。宣城县因塘坝民主管理得好，一般塘坝都存有七成水。（新华社）
    苏北区开展了群众性的抗旱保苗运动，各地农民正因地制宜地用各种办法来和旱象作斗争。
    苏北一般地区将近一月未雨，部分地区旱情严重。山区缺水栽秧，平原已栽秧田缺水灌溉，旱田作物如高粱、玉米等都受旱卷缩发黄。苏北人民行政公署曾于六月下旬召开了抗旱会议。各地农民在人民政府领导下，都根据不同的地理条件，大力开发水源，引水灌溉。旱田区农民纷纷打井挖塘，利用地下水灌溉。盐城县秦南区农民在六月底开挖小河二十一条，撩沟八条，使二万亩田有了水灌溉。沭阳全县已打井一千一百眼。睢宁县魏集区农民打井二百四十眼，解决了全区栽山芋用水问题。地下水水位较低地区，平地挖塘不易渗水，农民们便在干涸的河塘河沟里挖塘打井。仪征、六合山区并组织人力畜力，背水上山灌溉。有河流可以灌溉的地区，农民们正在筑坝拦水引水灌溉。如东县苴镇区沿堤、长沙等四乡，组织了六百二十五个劳动力，筑拦水坝一百零二条，集中六十六部水车，日夜不停的车水拨水，灌足了可浇八百五十亩秧田的塘水。
    苏北区抗旱保苗斗争中，互助组起了很大的推动作用。如东县前进乡乃西村冒长发互助组，组织了六个推水组，每天每组轮流推水两个钟点，六天时间解决了全组九十六亩秧田缺水问题，扭转了附近农民消极等雨思想，使他们也纷纷组织起来推水护苗。　（新华社）
