Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 1st, TASS dispatch: Philippine President Quirino is scheduled to visit Indonesia on July 16th. The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on this matter. The statement recalled: As early as 1949, "Quirino, under the orders of the United States, proposed the establishment of a Pacific Union. Up to now, he has been working hard to realize this plan." The Central Committee also reminded that Quirino said on June 20th that he would raise the issue of establishing a Pacific Union similar to the North Atlantic Alliance during his visits to Indonesia and Australia. The statement said: "This shows that Quirino's visit to Indonesia has political purposes. Once these political purposes are realized, they will bring suffering to the Indonesian people and re-enslave them. This attempt by Quirino will be severely condemned by the peace-loving Indonesian people."

    印尼共产党发表声明
    揭露季里诺访问印尼的阴谋
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社雅加达一日讯：菲律宾总统季里诺定于七月十六日访问印度尼西亚。印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会就此事发表声明。声明追述道：早在一九四九年，“季里诺就奉了美国之命提议建立太平洋联盟，迄今为止，他一直为实现这种计划而努力。”中央委员会同时提醒说：季里诺在六月二十日曾说，他将在访问印度尼西亚和澳大利亚期间，提出建立类似北大西洋联盟的太平洋联盟的问题。声明说：“这表明季里诺的访问印度尼西亚是有政治目的的。这些政治目的一旦实现，将给印尼人民带来苦难，并使他们重新遭到奴役。季里诺的这种企图将受到爱好和平的印尼人民的严厉谴责。”
