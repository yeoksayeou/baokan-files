    Our Great Motherland
    The No. 4 Factory of the Northeast Rubber Plant once used reclaimed rubber instead of raw rubber, saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Now, after more than a year of research, it has created a "mechanical cold pressing molding method," which further saves a lot of raw materials, improves production efficiency, and solves the labor protection problems of workers in the pressing workshop, making the workers feel physically and mentally happy. This is a scene of male and female workers leaving work at the factory.
