    The Northwest literary and art circles rectification and study movement concluded at the end of June. A large number of literary and art workers have now been organized to work in factories, rural areas, along railways, and in ethnic minority areas.
    During the rectification and study period, more than 1,200 participating literary and art workers universally connected with reality, launched criticism and self-criticism, and fully examined the various non-proletarian ideologies existing in their literary and artistic thinking. At the same time, they also conducted relatively profound criticism of the tendency of literary and artistic work to deviate from politics, reality, and the masses.
    In order to consolidate the achievements of the Xian literary and art circles in this movement, continue to strengthen the ideological transformation of literary and art workers, and implement Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, the Xian Municipal Literary and Art Circles Rectification and Study Committee successively convened six specialized meetings on creation, publications, drama, folk art, fine arts, and music. They decided on concrete plans and steps regarding vigorously launching the creation movement, doing a good job in guiding mass literary and art activities, extensively cultivating literary and art cadres, and strengthening literary and art criticism.
    Currently, 45 literary and art workers in Xian have formed 12 creation groups and have set off to factories, rural areas, the Tianlan Railway line, and ethnic minority areas to experience life and create. The Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles has also established a Creation Research Committee to help literary and art workers complete their creative tasks. In addition, the Northwest Literary and Art Work Troupe, the Northwest Folk Art Improvement Association, the Northwest People's Theater Troupe, the Shaanxi Provincial Literary and Art Work Troupe, and other literary and art units have also organized performance teams to tour factories, rural areas, the Tianlan Railway line, and various small and medium-sized cities.

    西北文艺界整风运动结束
    西北文艺界整风学习运动已在六月底结束，大批文艺工作者现已开始组织起来，分别到工厂、农村、铁路沿线和少数民族地区去工作。
    在整风学习期间，参加学习的一千二百多名文艺工作者，都普遍联系实际，展开批评和自我批评，充分检查了文艺思想上所存在的各种非无产阶级意识；同时对于文艺工作脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的倾向也进行了比较深刻的批判。
    西安市的文艺界整风学习委员会为了巩固西安市文艺界在这次运动中的成绩，继续加强文艺工作者的思想改造，贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方针，曾先后召开了创作、刊物、戏剧、曲艺、美术、音乐等六个专门会议，决定了关于大力开展创作运动，作好群众文艺运动的辅导工作，大量培养文艺干部和加强文艺批评的具体计划和步骤。
    现在，西安市已有四十五个文艺工作者组成了十二个创作小组，分别出发到工厂、农村、天兰铁路沿线和少数民族地区去体验生活，进行创作。西北文学艺术界联合会也成立了创作研究委员会，帮助文艺工作者完成创作任务。此外，西北文艺工作团、西北曲艺改进协会、西北民众剧团、陕西省文艺工作团等文艺单位，也都分别组织了演出队到工厂、农村、天兰铁路沿线和各中小城市去巡回演出。（新华社）
