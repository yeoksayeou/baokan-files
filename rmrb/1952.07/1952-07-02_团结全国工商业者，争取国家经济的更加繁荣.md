    The preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has successfully concluded.
    Although this meeting was still a preparatory representative meeting, it had broad representation. The meeting was attended by 413 representatives from industrial and commercial circles in all provinces, cities, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan, including 76 representatives from state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, 18 specially invited representatives, and 319 representatives from private industry and commerce, including representatives from large, medium, and small cities, large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises, handicraftsmen, stallholders, and capitalist agents, as well as representatives from industrial and commercial figures from ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese. It is particularly gratifying that representatives from industrial and commercial circles in Xinjiang and Tibet also came to Beijing from the remote frontiers of the motherland. This is an unprecedented grand gathering of Chinese industrial and commercial circles, demonstrating the unity within the Chinese people and the unity of the industrial and commercial circles themselves. This is only possible after the establishment of the People's Democratic Dictatorship of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the correct implementation of the Common Program, the development and adjustment of industry and commerce, and the unity and education of industrialists and businessmen. This fact further proves the correctness of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party's policies and the brilliance of their leadership.
    This meeting was held just after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, which is of particularly important significance. Because through this great movement, all "three evils" and "five poisons" that corrupt government organs, endanger national construction, and hinder social progress have been largely eliminated; and the national industrial and commercial circles have also taken on a new look as a result. On this basis, it is undoubtedly more appropriate than at any time in the past to convene the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and to establish the preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce through this meeting.
    In less than three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the face of China's social economy has greatly changed. The market chaos caused by inflation and soaring prices under the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has now been completely overcome. Industrial and agricultural production, which was severely damaged in more than ten years of war, has now been restored and has made considerable progress. In the meantime, the recovery and development of private industry and commerce is also very significant; both in terms of the number of industrial and commercial households and in terms of their business volume, they are constantly growing. During this period, private industry and commerce not only developed, but also underwent initial transformation. At the beginning of liberation, private industry and commerce were affected by more than ten years of inflation, and not only was speculation rampant, but even legitimate industry and commerce participated in speculative activities. Following the cessation of inflation and the stabilization of prices, the once rampant speculative trade gradually disappeared. Coupled with the government's implementation of the work of adjusting industry and commerce, private industry and commerce recovered and developed on a normal track. However, in the process of this recovery and development, a large part of private industry and commerce still retained the filth and poison left over from the old society, which have been fully exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements are a social reform movement that changes customs and habits, and also a movement to further transform industry and commerce. Through this movement, industrialists and businessmen have been criticized and educated by the people of the whole country, and have also conducted frank self-criticism. The People's Government vigorously eliminates the "five poisons" while protecting the legitimate profits obtained by private industrialists and businessmen through legitimate operations. After the "Five-Anti" Movement, most industrialists and businessmen have been able to devote themselves to how to develop production and improve management. The enthusiasm of workers and staff for production and work has also been greatly improved. This will create more favorable conditions for the development of legitimate private industry and commerce.
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements have given the whole country a new look, making it necessary and possible for us to adjust public-private relations and labor-capital relations on a new basis to ensure the sound development of industry and commerce. As early as before the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the relevant financial and economic departments under the Central People's Government had repeatedly studied the new situation and began to implement a series of important measures. For example, the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government issued a circular to trade agencies across the country during the most intense period of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, requiring them to quickly restore and expand processing orders; the Head Office of the People's Bank of China also issued a circular to branches across the country, requiring them to quickly restore and expand lending, so that the market situation was generally in a normal state. Subsequently, the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government began to review and adjust the processing fees and prices of processing orders, on the one hand correcting the past mistakes of private factories in falsely reporting costs and seeking exorbitant profits, and on the other hand appropriately increasing the processing fees and prices of certain commodities with low profits in the past, according to the possibilities, to ensure that private factories obtain more reasonable profits. For example, the processing fee for cotton yarn, which is entirely processed for the state, has been increased starting from June 1. In order to support the development of industry and commerce, the People's Bank of China also resolutely reduced the interest rates on deposits and loans, so that they were generally restored to the normal level before the Anti-Japanese War. These new measures are naturally only possible today after the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, the stability of financial prices, the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, and the elimination of the "three evils" and "five poisons." The emergence of these new measures should be welcomed by industrialists and businessmen across the country.
    Of course, there are still some problems in industry and commerce that need to be further addressed. For example, the processing fees and prices in processing orders need to be further adjusted, and specifications must be detailed industry by industry to avoid shoddy work and materials and to resolve disputes in acceptance. For example, the exchange between urban and rural areas is not smooth at present, and it is necessary to adjust the regional price differences of general commodities and the wholesale and retail price differences so that legitimate private businesses can participate in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In terms of taxation, the collection of income tax in some places still has excessively light or heavy phenomena, and a careful review is necessary. Those with inappropriate calculations can request reconsideration, and overpayments will be refunded and underpayments will be supplemented. The selection of typical industrial and commercial households for democratic evaluation should be done through consultation and strive to be appropriate. On labor-capital issues, labor-capital relations in all large industrial and commercial enterprises are generally normal after the "Five-Anti" Movement, and many factories have even made more obvious improvements than before. However, in some private enterprises, especially small workshops and stores, labor-capital relations are still abnormal, which must be appropriately adjusted in accordance with the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. All these issues are being carefully studied by the relevant departments of the Central Government, and various effective measures will be taken to implement the speech of Director Chen Yun of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council at the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The government has taken these effective measures to protect legitimate private industry and commerce, and private industrialists and businessmen should also seriously examine themselves, ensure compliance with the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government, and never commit the "five poisons" again, otherwise they will be severely punished by the government and the people.
    In the future, our economic situation will continue to improve, and private industry and commerce also has a brighter future. New Democratic economic construction is a development process of the Chinese economy, and also a reorganization process. In this process of development and reorganization, it will be inevitable that some industries and businesses will encounter difficulties. But these are difficulties in the development process, so these difficulties can be gradually resolved through economic development; and the industrialization of the Chinese economy will be the most important key to completely solving these difficulties. Now some small and medium-sized enterprises have raised the issue of requiring a change of occupation, and the government should provide appropriate care within the possible scope. The so-called change of occupation includes two aspects: capital change of occupation and labor change of occupation. At present, the difficulty of capital change of occupation is not great, and there are many industries to invest in. The difficulty is the change of occupation of workers and staff. Therefore, this issue cannot be solved solely by passive methods, but must be solved by active methods, that is, from the development of industry and commerce, especially from the development of modern industry. We must try to expand the work of economic planning as much as possible, but relying solely on the above-mentioned measures will still not be able to solve all the problems of large, medium, and small cities and large, medium, and small industries across the country; what can be solved by relying on the above-mentioned measures are only the more important and general problems. Following the development of economic construction work, we will pay more attention to small and medium-sized cities and small and medium-sized industries, and pay attention to ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese, so that large and small industrialists and businessmen across the country can play their respective roles in the country's large-scale economic construction in the future.
    Now the national organization of industrialists and businessmen—the preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce—has been established. This national organization of industrialists and businessmen should lead industrialists and businessmen across the country to abide by the Common Program, promote the policies and laws of the People's Government; and represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen across the country, reflect opinions to the People's Government and relevant agencies, and make suggestions. It should promote and assist the reorganization of local federations of industry and commerce and trade associations, and should take care of all large, medium, and small cities and large, medium, and small industries across the country, so that all strata of the industrial and commercial circles can be in their proper places and unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to engage in production and operation that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Leading comrades of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives should also participate in the Federation of Industry and Commerce and assume certain responsibilities. We should attach importance to the organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and unite industrialists and businessmen across the country through this organization, so that they can work together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy to strive for greater prosperity of the national economy!

### 团结全国工商业者，争取国家经济的更加繁荣

    团结全国工商业者，争取国家经济的更加繁荣
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，圆满闭幕了。
    此次会议虽然还是一个筹备代表会议，但是它具有广泛的代表性。到会的有全国各省、市、内蒙、西藏及台湾的工商界代表四百一十三人，包括国营企业和合作社的代表七十六人，特邀代表十八人，私营工商业的代表三一九人，其中有全国大、中、小城市，大、中、小工商企业，手工业者，摊商和资方代理人的代表，以及少数民族，海外侨胞的工商业者的代表，特别值得欣喜的是新疆和西藏工商界的代表也从祖国辽远的边疆赶到了北京。这是中国工商界的一个空前的盛会，表现着中国人民内部的团结，和工商界本身的团结。这只有在毛主席和中国共产党领导下建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，正确执行了共同纲领，发展并调整了工商业，团结并教育了工商业者以后，才有可能。从这一件事实，更证明了毛主席和中国共产党的政策的正确，和领导的英明。
    这个会议刚刚在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动以后召开，这是有着特别重要的意义的。因为经过这个伟大的运动，一切腐蚀政府机关，危害国家建设，阻碍社会前进的“三害”和“五毒”，已被大量清除出去；全国的工商界也因此而面貌一新。在这基础之上来召开全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，并通过这个会议来产生中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，无疑地比过去任何时期更为恰当。
    中华人民共和国成立以来不到三年，中国社会经济的面貌已经大为改变。在国民党长期的反动统治下，由于通货膨胀，物价飞涨所造成的市场混乱现象，现在已经完全克服了。在十余年战争中受到严重破坏的工业、农业生产，现在已经恢复，并已有了相当大的发展。在这中间，私营工商业的恢复和发展，同样也是十分显著的；不论从工商业的户数来看，或者从其营业数额来看，都是在不断地增长中。在这一时期，私营工商业不但得到了发展，而且得到了初步的改造。在初解放时，私营工商业受十余年的通货膨胀影响，不但投机资本十分猖狂，就连正当的工商业亦多参加投机活动。跟着通货膨胀的停止和物价的稳定，曾经猖狂一时的投机贸易也就逐渐归于消灭。再加上政府调整工商业工作的实施，私营工商业就在正常的轨道上恢复起来，发展起来了。但在这恢复和发展的过程中，私营工商业中有很大的一部分还保存着从旧社会遗留下来的污毒，这些污毒在此次“三反”“五反”运动中业已充分暴露出来。“三反”“五反”是一个移风易俗的社会改革运动，同时也是进一步改造工商业的运动。经过这次运动，工商业者受到了全国人民的批评和教育，且亦进行了坦白和自我批评。人民政府大力清除“五毒”，同时保护私营工商业者依靠正当经营所获得的合法利润。在“五反”后大部分工商业者已能专心致志于如何发展生产，改善经营。职工们生产和工作的积极性也大大提高。这将为正当的私营工商业的发展创造更为有利的条件。
    “三反”“五反”运动使全国气象焕然一新，使我们有必要并有可能在新的基础上来调整公私关系，劳资关系，以保证工商业的健全发展。早在“三反”“五反”运动尚未胜利结束以前，中央人民政府所属有关财经部门，就已经反复研究新的情况，并开始进行一系列的重要措施。如中央贸易部于“三反”“五反”运动最紧张的时期，即已通令全国贸易机关迅速恢复并扩大加工定货工作，中国人民银行总行亦通令全国分支机构迅速恢复并扩大贷款工作，这样就使市场情况一般的处于正常状态之中。接着中央贸易部开始审查并调整加工定货的工缴和货价，一方面纠正了过去私营工厂虚报成本、牟取暴利的错误，另一方面又把过去利润偏低的某些商品的工缴和货价，按照可能的情况适当提高，以保障私营工厂获得比较合理的利润。像全部接受国家加工定货的棉纱的工缴，就已经在六月一日开始提高了。中国人民银行为着扶助工商业发展，也毅然决然降低存放款的利息，使它大体上恢复到抗日战争以前的正常的水平。这些新的措施，自然只有在财政收支平衡，金融物价稳定，工业农业生产恢复和发展，并消除了“三害”“五毒”后的今天才有可能。这些新的措施的出现，应该是全国工商业者所额手庆幸的。
    当然目前工商业中尚有若干问题，有待于我们继续加以解决。如加工定货中的工缴和货价尚待继续调整，并须逐行逐业详订规格，以避免偷工减料，并解决验收中的纠纷。如城乡交流目前尚未畅通，需要调整一般商品的地区差价，和批发零售差价，使正当的私营商业能够参加城乡物资交流。在税收方面，某些地方所得税的征收仍然有畸轻畸重现象，须再认真检查，计算不当者可提出复议，多退少补。民主评议的工商业户，选择典型应经过协商，力求适当。在劳资问题上，“五反”运动后所有大工商业的劳资关系一般是正常的，有不少工厂且比以前有了更明显的改进。但在一部分私营企业，特别是小的作坊和商店中，劳资关系还不正常，这必须按照发展生产，劳资两利的原则，来作适当的调整。所有这些问题，中央各有关部门正在慎重研究，并将采取各种有效措施，来实现政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的讲话。政府采取了这些有效措施来保护正当的私营工商业，私营工商业者亦应该认真检查自己，保证遵守共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，决不再犯“五毒”，否则必将受到政府和人民的严惩。
    今后我们的经济情况将更继续好转，私营工商业也有着更为光明的前途。新民主主义经济建设是中国经济的一个发展过程，同时也是一个改组过程。在这发展和改组的过程中，部分工商业的遇到困难，仍将是无可避免的。但这是发展过程中的困难，因此这些困难可以从经济发展中去逐渐求得解决；而中国经济的工业化，将是彻底解决这些困难的最重要的关键。现在某些中小企业提出了要求转业的问题，政府应该在可能的范围内予以适当的照顾。所谓转业，包括了资金转业与劳动力转业二方面，现在资金转业的困难不大，可投资的行业很多，困难的是职工的转业。因此这个问题，就不是单靠消极的办法所能解决，而必须采取积极的办法，即从工商业的发展，特别是从现代工业的发展中去求得解决。我们要尽量扩大经济计划化的工作，但仅仅依靠上述这些措施，也还是不可能解决全国所有大、中、小城市和大、中、小行业的一切问题；依靠上述措施所能解决的，还只是比较重大的和一般性的问题。跟着经济建设工作的开展，我们将更注意于中小城市和中小行业，并注意到少数民族和海外侨胞，使全国的大中小工商业者，均能在今后国家的大规模的经济建设中，发挥其各自的力量。
    现在工商业者的全国性组织——中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会产生了。这个全国性的工商业者的组织，应该领导全国工商业者遵守共同纲领，推行人民政府的政策法令；并代表全国工商业者的正当利益，向人民政府和有关机关反映意见，提出建议。它应该推动和协助各地工商业联合会及同业公会的改组，并应该照顾全国所有大、中、小城市和大、中、小行业，使工商界各阶层都能够各得其所，团结在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，从事有利于国计民生的生产和经营。国营经济和合作社的领导同志也应该参加工商业联合会，并担负一定的责任。我们应该重视工商业联合会这一个组织，通过这个组织来团结全国工商业者，使他们都能在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下与全国人民协同努力，争取国家经济的更加繁荣！
