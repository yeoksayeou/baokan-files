    Suggest Strengthening Education for Storytellers
    Editor: In Xiahe Town, Zhoucun, Shandong, there are two folk artists who tell Dagushu (a type of storytelling accompanied by drum music), attracting hundreds of listeners every day, including young men and women workers, farmers, and merchants. However, the stories they tell are mostly old novels with strong feudal and superstitious elements.

    These two storytellers are very talented. Some farmers even abandon their productive work and spend all day listening in the storytelling venue. Some workers also go to listen a few times during their holidays. Some women and old people even bring their innocent children to listen. Xin Guitang, a student in our school, ignoring school rules and the advice of teachers and classmates, has also sneaked away to listen seven or eight times. We are conducting anti-feudal and anti-superstition education among the masses, but the storytellers are injecting poison into the masses. We are promoting "drought prevention and resistance" to farmers, explaining the principle of "man can conquer nature," but they are instilling a reliance on heaven, while also delaying farmers' production. This is very bad. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities strengthen the education of storytellers, so that they can tell more new stories and gradually transform them into folk artists who serve the people.

    建议加强对说书艺人的教育
    编辑同志：山东周村下河镇有两位说大鼓书的民间艺人，每天吸引着几百个听众，其中有青年男女工人、农民和商人等。但是说大鼓书的人所说的多半是些带有浓厚封建迷信色彩的旧小说。
    这两位说书的人很有说书的才能。有的农民甚至抛开生产工作，整天在说书场里听，有的工人也在休假日去听几回，有些妇女和老头子竟带着他们天真的儿童跑去听了。我们学校里的信桂堂同学，不顾学校规则，不管老师和同学们的劝告，也偷去听了七、八回。我们向群众进行反封建、反迷信的教育，而说书的人却在给群众灌输毒素。我们向农民宣传“防旱抗旱”，说明“人定胜天”的道理，而他们却给农民灌输一些靠天思想，同时还耽误了农民的生产，这是很不好的。因此，我建议有关机关加强对说书人的教育，使他们多说一些新书，逐渐把他们改造成为人民服务的民间艺人。
