    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: A large number of cultural relics and historical sites in Nara, the famous ancient capital of Japan, are facing the danger of being destroyed by the American occupiers. The Japanese people are stepping forward to defend their nation's cultural heritage.
    Nara is a city with a long history, and the ancient Japanese dynasties once established their capitals there for a long time. It is home to precious Japanese historical relics and monuments. However, with the United States expanding its network of military bases everywhere in Japan today, this ancient Japanese capital has also suffered threats. The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, which studies military base issues, has preliminarily decided that the United States will use an air force base near Nara City. According to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Education, there are seventy-eight national treasures, nine hundred and seven other important cultural monuments, and seventy historical monuments near this air force base. What particularly concerns the Japanese people is that this air force base is only eight kilometers away from Horyu-ji Temple, one of the most precious monuments of the Japanese nation. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the residents of Nara believe that if the United States uses this air force base, the danger of these national treasures and monuments being damaged is too great. Therefore, they have lodged strong protests with the Yoshida government on this matter. At the same time, the Japan Electrical Communication Workers' Union, which is holding a national congress in Nara City, also passed a resolution on the 11th on this matter, firmly opposing the United States leasing military bases in Japan.
    Under the fierce opposition of the Japanese people, the Japanese Ministry of Education has had to express that it will strongly protest the plan to build an American military base near Nara in the Japanese Diet.

    日本人民反对美国在奈良修建空军基地
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：著名的日本故都奈良的大批文物古迹，面临着被美国占领者破坏的危机。日本人民正挺身而出，为维护自己民族的文化遗产而斗争。
    奈良是一个历史悠久的城市，日本古代的王朝曾经长期建都于此。在这里聚集着珍贵的日本历史文物和古迹。但是，在美国在日本到处扩张军事基地网的今天，这个日本故都也遭受到了威胁。从事研究军事基地等问题的美日联合委员会已经初步决定美国将在奈良市附近使用一个空军基地。据日本文部省（教育部）官员透露，在这个空军基地附近有日本的七十八件国宝、九百零七件其他的重要文化古迹和七十块历史性的纪念碑。特别使日本人民关怀的是：这个空军基地离日本民族最宝贵的古迹之一法隆寺只有八公里。“朝日新闻”说，奈良的居民认为，如果美国使用这个空军基地，这些国宝和古迹受到破坏的危险是太大了。因此，他们已就此事向吉田政府提出强烈的抗议。同时，正在奈良市举行全国代表大会的日本电气通信省（邮电部）工会，十一日也就此事通过了一项决议，坚决反对美国在日本租借军事基地。
    在日本人民激烈的反对下，日本文部省不得不表示将在日本国会中极力抗议在奈良附近修建美国军事基地的计划。
