Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 27th: Our special correspondent reports: Harrison requested another seven-day adjournment yesterday, setting a new record for his walkouts. This is already his fourth walkout recorded in the Panmunjom meeting records. What’s different is that this walkout is longer, foreshadowing even longer walkouts in the future; this shows that the U.S. is determined to continue dragging out the armistice negotiations indefinitely.

    Harrison took this unreasonable action on the first day the plenary session of both delegations turned from administrative meetings to open meetings, and once again impolitely left the meeting before it was over. Harrison is clearly finding it increasingly difficult to sit shamelessly in his "unenviable" position as chief representative of the United Nations Command negotiating team. The U.S. side publicly claims to be willing to seek "a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides" on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, while in administrative meetings they continue to insist on the unreasonable plan to detain a large number of our captured personnel; Harrison is engaged in this kind of "selling dog meat as mutton" trick, no wonder he couldn't stand it on the first day of the public meeting and hurried away from the justice of all mankind.

    The results of the eighteen administrative meetings show that the "sincerity" claimed by the U.S. on July 1st in seeking a Korean armistice is completely false. At that time, the U.S. side proposed the principle of Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement as the basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. At the same time, they also agreed that prisoners of war should be repatriated home to live peaceful lives. According to these principles, all prisoners of war held by both sides should be released and repatriated as soon as possible after the armistice is realized, allowing them to return home to live peaceful lives. Korean prisoners of war whose homes are in the holding party's area may be allowed to return home locally without repatriation, while those whose homes are in the other party's area must be repatriated; prisoners of war of other nationalities should all be repatriated. This method is completely fair and reasonable, and conforms to the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. Since both parties have confirmed the above principles, as long as both parties reclassify and correct the existing lists of prisoners of war, the issue of prisoner of war repatriation can be resolved immediately, and the armistice can be achieved immediately.

    However, in the administrative meetings, the U.S. abandoned the principles they had agreed to and continued to cling to the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" that had long been bankrupt, and proposed an unreasonable plan to repatriate only 83,000 of our captured personnel. Everyone remembers that after the U.S. proposed the unreasonable plan on April 28th to repatriate 70,000 of our captured personnel, they repeatedly claimed that the plan was the result of "screening" all of our captured personnel, and repeatedly said every day that the plan was "firm, final, and unchangeable." However, with the occurrence of heroic struggle incidents by our captured personnel in U.S. prisoner of war camps in Geoje Island and Busan, the criminal fact that the U.S. used forced "screening" to detain prisoners of war was completely exposed. Under the unanimous angry condemnation of the people of the world, the embarrassed U.S. had to secretly withdraw its "firm, final, and unchangeable" plan, and proposed another plan, saying that this new plan was "based on the results of screening all captured personnel." As long as the U.S.'s two plans are compared, people can see that although the two plans have increased in numbers, they are basically the same plan, and their essence is to use illegal and false so-called "screening" to achieve the despicable purpose of detaining a large number of our captured personnel.

    It is not difficult for people to remember that on the same day, July 13th, there were two different versions of the so-called "screening" results of our captured personnel. Clark submitted a report to the United Nations on the 13th, saying that after "screening," more than 100,000 prisoners of war "refused" repatriation; that is to say, only 70,000 "voluntarily repatriated." Harrison said at the negotiating table on the same day that 83,000 people "voluntarily repatriated," and according to Harrison, this was also the result of "screening." Is Clark slapping Harrison in the face, or is Harrison slapping Clark in the face? People will not bother with it, but this shows that the number of prisoners of war proposed by the U.S., whether it is 70,000 or 80,000, is all a shameless fabrication. Facts prove that what the U.S. cares about is not the "inherent rights" of prisoners of war that they have repeatedly manipulated, but how to detain as many prisoners of war as possible. In the eyes of the American aggressors, the repatriation of prisoners of war is not an obligation stipulated by international treaties that they should fulfill, but a population transaction that can be bargained for.

    Another opportunity for the Korean armistice negotiations to reach an agreement has been destroyed by the U.S. The American aggressors who do not want peace are now apparently trying to obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations with more destructive means, and Harrison's walkout is only the beginning of such destructive means. But no matter what means the U.S. uses, one thing is clear, that is, our principle of enabling prisoners of war on both sides to return home to live peaceful lives is firm and unshakable. Any means of delay and sabotage of the negotiations by the U.S. can only arouse greater anger and opposition from the people of the world, and will not affect our position in the slightest.

### 哈利逊第四次无耻逃会  表示美方决心阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判

    哈利逊第四次无耻逃会
    表示美方决心阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊昨天又要求休会七天，创造了他的逃会的新纪录。在板门店的会议纪录上，这已经是他的第四次逃会了。不同的是这次逃会时间更长，预示着以后还会有更长时间的逃会；这说明美方决心把停战谈判继续无限期地拖下去。
    哈利逊在双方代表团大会由行政性会议转入公开会议的第一天就采取了这种无理的行动，并且又一次毫无礼貌地在会议还没有结束时就中途退出会场。哈利逊显然一天比一天更难于大言不惭地坐在他那联合国军谈判首席代表的“无可羡慕的”位置上了。美方一面公开声称愿意在战俘遣返问题上寻求“一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，一面却在行政性会议上仍然坚持扣留大批我方被俘人员的无理方案；哈利逊干着这种“挂羊头卖狗肉”的勾当，无怪乎要在公开会议的第一天就站不住脚，赶紧从全世界人类正义面前逃走了。
    十八次行政性会议的结果显示：美方在七月一日所宣称的觅求朝鲜停战的“诚意”，完全是虚伪的。当时美方曾经提出以停战协定草案第五十一款的原则，作为解决战俘遣返问题的基础。同时他们并表示同意战俘应遣返回家过和平生活的原则。根据这些原则，双方所收容的全部战俘在停战实现以后应该尽速予以释放与遣返，让他们回家过和平生活。朝鲜籍战俘中家在收容一方者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返，家在另方者则必须遣返；其他国籍的战俘则应该全部遣返。这个办法是完全公平合理的，符合于一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约的。既然双方都确认了上述原则，那么只要双方对已有的战俘名单加以重新分类和校正，战俘遣返问题就立即可以得到解决，停战就可以马上实现。
    但是在行政性会议上，美方却抛弃了他们曾经同意的原则，继续死死抓住早已破产的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则不放，提出了只遣返八万三千名我方被俘人员的无理方案。大家都记得，美方在四月二十八日提出遣返七万我方被俘人员的无理方案以后，他曾经口口声声说那个方案是对全部我方被俘人员进行“甄别”的结果，并且天天重复说那个方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”。但是，随着巨济岛和釜山等地美方战俘营中我方被俘人员英勇斗争事件的发生，美方用强迫“甄别”来扣留战俘的罪恶事实彻底暴露了。在全世界人民一致愤怒声讨之下，出了丑的美方只好偷偷地收回了它的“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”方案，而提出了另一个方案，又说这个新的方案是“以对全部被俘人员的甄别结果为根据的”。只要把美方的两次方案拿来比较一下，人们就可以看出：这两个方案虽然在数字上有所增加，但基本上仍然是一个方案，其实质就是用非法的虚伪的所谓“甄别”，来达到扣留大批我方被俘人员的卑鄙目的。
    人们不难记起，同在七月十三日这一天，有两个不同的关于对我方被俘人员的所谓“甄别”结果的说法。克拉克在十三日向联合国提出一份报告说，经过“甄别”以后，有十万多战俘“拒绝”遣返；这就是说“自愿遣返”的只有七万人。哈利逊同一天在谈判会上却说“自愿遣返”的有八万三千人，而照哈利逊说来，这也是“甄别”的结果。这究竟是克拉克打哈利逊的耳光呢，还是哈利逊打克拉克的耳光呢，人们且不去管它，但是这倒说明了：美方所提出的遣俘数字，无论是七万也好，无论是八万也好，全是无耻的捏造。事实证明：美方所关心的完全不是它们所一再搬弄的战俘的“固有权利”，而是如何能尽可能扣留更多的战俘。在美国侵略者看来，遣返战俘不是他们应当履行的国际条约所规定的义务，而是一宗可以讨价还价的人口买卖。
    朝鲜停战谈判获致协议的又一个机会，已经被美方破坏了。不愿和平的美国侵略者现在显然想用更多的破坏手段来阻挠和破坏停战谈判，哈利逊的逃会只是这种破坏手段的开始而已。但是无论美方用什么手段，有一点是很明白的，这就是我方的使双方战俘都能回家过和平生活的原则是坚定不移的，美方的任何拖延和破坏谈判的手段，只能引起全世界人民更大的愤怒和反对，丝毫不能影响我方的立场。
