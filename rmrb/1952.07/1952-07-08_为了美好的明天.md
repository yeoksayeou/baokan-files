Korean Correspondence

    For a Better Tomorrow
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Soldier Wang Xilin

    Editor's Note: This is a dispatch from the Korean front. The author, Comrade Wang Xilin, is a soldier in the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. This dispatch fully demonstrates the revolutionary optimism and great heroic spirit of the Volunteer Army soldiers. The author is twenty-one years old this year, from Jin County, Northeast China. He came from a poor family and only attended school for a few years. At the age of thirteen, he became a trainee on the railway and later worked as an apprentice in a hospital. In 1950, he joined the Volunteer Army to fight abroad. He studies very hard and also loves literature and art. "For a Better Tomorrow" is a true story from his class; Comrade Wang Yu in the article is his squad leader. He wrote this dispatch from Wang Yu's perspective. He used four evenings after dinner and before lights out to write this dispatch on the busy front lines.

    This was the last night of defending the beachhead on the south bank of the Han River.

    In the December night, the north wind howled with snowflakes in the valley, and the mountain top, covered with shell craters, was thickly covered with a layer of white. The enemy's artillery fire had stopped, and the air was still mixed with the smell of gunpowder.

    I suddenly thought of something, jumped out of the fortification, and quietly called next to the fortification on the right: "Wu Zhenchang, Wu Zhenchang!" A strong voice came: "I'm here! Squad leader, we're stomping our feet; our feet and shoe soles are frozen together!" It turned out that Wu Zhenchang and Comrade Li Wanfu were jumping in a depression to keep warm. Their big-headed shoes creaked as they stepped. I waved my hand and said, "Let's take this opportunity to repair the fortifications!" They ran over immediately.

    We used our hands to dig through more than half a foot of snow, wanting to dig some soil to cover the top of the air-raid shelter. But as soon as the shovel touched the ground, there was a "clang" and a white mark, and we couldn't dig in no matter what. I quickly pulled out Wu Zhenchang's bayonet and started digging hard. At first, I felt my hands were freezing, but later I didn't feel anything. After digging a large pile of soil, I got a blister on my palm. We pressed the soil on top of the air-raid shelter and sprinkled some snow powder on it. I carefully looked at it. It was firm and not easy to expose the target. I happily said, "Let the enemy fire shells if they want to!"

    "Squad leader, do you have any tobacco?" Wu Zhenchang really wanted to smoke.

    I reached out and took out the tobacco crumbs that I had saved for more than twenty days without smoking, and let him go into the air-raid shelter to smoke while I watched the enemy for them.

    I sat on the edge of the cave with my automatic rifle, rubbing my dry eyes. Wu Zhenchang, holding a cigarette, smiled and said, "We haven't had a drop of water to drink in more than twenty days, using fried noodles to fill our stomachs and snow water to quench our thirst. Do you think Chairman Mao knows?"

    "Of course, he knows. Didn't Comrade Chai Chuanruo go back to China to give a report! I heard that Chairman Mao personally talked to him and found out everything!" Before I finished speaking, they both said in unison, "Right! We must earn an international merit to win glory for our motherland!" I said, "This is the crucial moment to earn merit. For the sake of our motherland's better tomorrow, we cannot retreat a single step and must resolutely defend the position!" Wu Zhenchang put out his cigarette butt and said, "As long as we are here, we must defend the position! Even if we sacrifice ourselves, I believe the position will definitely be ours. Right? Squad leader." I nodded.

    I returned to the fortification, and my heart was churning. I thought, "It's not enough to just fight hard; we have to figure out a way to defend the position." Based on the experience of several battles, I knew that the devils were most afraid of close combat. We had been fighting for a day, and we didn't have many bullets left, so it was a good idea to use grenades to eliminate the enemy. The comrades would calmly and boldly fight the enemy, and there would be no problem no matter how many devils came. I had a plan in my mind, stood up suddenly, and ordered Wu Zhenchang: "Tell Comrade Li Wanfu to place all the grenades in front of the fortifications, and when the enemy gets close, throw them all together upon my order!" After speaking, I placed all my twenty-odd grenades in front of the fortification: "Come on! Let you taste the Chinese 'iron dumplings'!"

    The wind carried the sound of artillery shells leaving the muzzle, and several more places on the mountain were scorched black.

    Before long, dozens of long-legged devils came up, carrying carbines. At first, they were very careful, attacking in several ways. Later, seeing that we didn't fire a single shot, they became bolder and brought out their old "sheep flock tactics." They were so close that we could even hear the officers yelling. A dozen devils had already run to within twenty meters of us. At this time, I felt like I was electrocuted, jumped up high, threw a grenade, and shouted, "Fire!" The grenades flew out like hail. Shrapnel and rocks flew into the air, and the devils immediately screamed. Roosevelt woolen clothes stained with flesh and blood were also covered with branches.

    The devils had tasted enough of the "iron dumplings," left more than twenty corpses, and rolled down the mountain while jabbering.

    I felt my head was heavy, and when I touched it with my hand, I was shocked! It was blood. Ah, I was wounded. Wu Zhenchang ran over to bandage me. He said, "It might have been a rock that hit you; the wound is quite long..." I understood what he meant, smiled, and said, "I haven't felt any pain yet!" To be honest, my head was throbbing. I lied to my comrades. How could I go down? Now one person is as good as a dozen, even the cook is still guarding the mountain! I can still throw grenades. I clearly remembered my oath and made up my mind that as long as I had this breath, I would lead the whole squad to block the devil's attack!

    The grenades were all used up. The enemy would definitely attack at dawn. I endured the headache, supported my body, ran out of the fortification, wanting to talk to the platoon leader about the situation, but I happened to run into the instructor. We sat down on the snow. The instructor said to me, "The enemy has gathered a large force and is preparing to pounce on our beachhead. Your squad's position is very important. If it is lost..." I stood at attention in front of the instructor and said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I want to express my attitude to you. As long as I have this breath, I can lead the whole squad to defeat the American bandits! Please rest assured, we will never let our country down!"

    "Good, these are the grenades saved by the logistics squad, and there are fifteen anti-tank mines, designated for you to throw!" He pointed to the dozen or so people who came with him behind him and said, "These are comrades from the machine gun company, cooperating with your squad!" Finally, the instructor shook my hand solemnly and said, "Comrade, whether it's steel or iron will be tested at this moment. Buy time, and definitely fight until tomorrow!" I saluted the instructor, and then sent the comrades from the machine gun company into the fortifications.

    The comrades didn't say a word when they met; they just shook hands and went to their designated positions.

    This time, Wu Zhenchang and I were guarding one fortification. Looking at the cliff under my feet, I remembered the year I herded sheep for the landlord. I was injured in the leg by a rock rolling down from such a steep mountain and it took more than half a year to recover. The devils will definitely charge up from here. I put big stones in front of the fortification, and if they climb halfway up the mountain, I will push the stones down, which will also hit the enemy! Thinking of this, I stood up, and Wu Zhenchang grabbed my arm and asked:

    "What are you doing?" I smiled and said, "Moving stones to smash the devils!" So he followed me out. There were many stones on the mountain. The comrades saw the trick and jumped out of the fortifications to move stones. In a short while, a long stone wall was formed in front of the fortifications.

    Eight Mustang fighter planes flew over the treetops and carried out a round of bombing and strafing. The snowy mountain suddenly turned into a volcano, and pine branches fell all over the ground. Then, according to the old rules, there was another volley of artillery fire, shaking the earth as if it were swaying.

    Wu Zhenchang said, "The show of force is over, and it's time for them to get a beating!" The comrades perked up their spirits one by one, widening their eyes and watching the mountain below.

    About two companies of the enemy, like a half-drawn net, were pouncing upwards. These clumsy pigs were climbing up on four hooves, and if their feet slipped, they would fall on their faces, rolling down. It took them three or four tries to reach the middle of the mountain.

    We opened fire! First, we pushed the stones down, and the machine guns also rattled. I sent out several grenades, and the devils scrambled and ran to hide under the cliff. After a while, the enemy used more than one battalion of troops to pounce up the mountain.

    Our 60mm mortars also opened fire! The shells burst in the enemy ranks, and the machine guns fired like rain. Excited, I shouted loudly, "Fire hard, this is the time for grenades to feast on flesh!" Black smoke mixed with snow powder filled the sky. The devils have the ability to bomb our positions black, but we have the confidence to turn their attacking routes red! When I threw the last four grenades, more than half of the devils were lying on the mountainside. The remaining devils had already rushed to the front of the position. Fire blazed in my chest, and I grabbed the iron shovel and jumped out of the fortification, shouting loudly, "For the motherland!" I knocked down a devil commander with my first shovel; I knocked down another devil in a row, smashing his head with the shovel. But my neck was also grabbed from behind by a pair of furry hands. I tried my best but couldn't turn around. At this time, I suddenly heard an "ouch" behind me, and the pair of big hands let go. I turned around and saw Wu Zhenchang standing beside me with a bayonet. He had stabbed the devil to death.

    Over there, three devils were wrestling with Comrade Li Wanfu. We hurried over. But it was too late. There was only a loud bang, and a puff of black smoke rose. Comrade Li Wanfu hugged three devils and detonated the last grenade.

    The sun turned red, and the golden light shone on the snowy field. American devils lay scattered all over the mountain. Those who were lucky enough to survive scurried south with their tails between their legs like stray dogs.

    Our artillery roared! Ah, the follow-up troops have arrived. I couldn't stand still, and my legs went weak and I sat on the ground. The instructor didn't know when he was already standing beside me, stroking the bandage on my head with his hand, and said, "Comrade Wang Yu, you were wounded but didn't leave the line of fire, and led the whole squad to actively find ways to bravely defeat eight enemy assaults. The higher-ups have decided to award you two major merits!"

    I was so excited that I forgot my headache and said, "Instructor, I have gained an experience: use bravery to defeat the enemy, use wit to defeat the enemy, and victory will always be ours!"

    为了美好的明天
    中国人民志愿军战士  王熙麟
    编者按：这是从朝鲜前线寄来的一篇通讯，作者王熙麟同志是志愿军某部八连的战士。这篇通讯充分表现了志愿军战士们革命的乐观主义和伟大的英雄气魄。作者今年二十一岁，东北锦县人，家庭贫苦，小时只念过几年书，十三岁就到铁路上当见习生，后来又在医院里当过学徒，一九五零年参加了志愿军出国作战。他平时学习很努力，也很喜爱文艺。“为了美好的明天”就是他们班里的真人真事；文中的王玉同志，就是他的班长。这篇通讯是他照着王玉的口气来写的。在战斗频繁的前线，他利用了四个晚饭后熄灯前的时间写成了这篇通讯。
    这是守备汉江南岸滩头阵地的最后一夜。
    腊月的夜里，北风卷着雪片在山谷中呼啸，那布满弹坑的山头上，厚厚地铺上了一层白衣。敌人的炮声停了，空气中还夹杂着火药的气味。
    我忽然想起一件事来，翻身跳出工事，跑到右边工事旁悄悄地叫：“吴振昌，吴振昌！”一个粗壮的声音传来：“在这儿哪！班长，我们跺脚，把脚跟和鞋底都冻在一块啦！”原来吴振昌和李万富同志正在一个洼坑里跳跃取暖，脚上大头鞋踏起来吱吱发响。我一招手说：“趁这工夫，咱们来修补一下工事吧！”他俩立刻跑过来了。
    我们用手扒开半尺多厚的雪，想挖些土往防空洞顶上盖。可是锹一碰地面，“当啷”一声一道白印，怎么也挖不进去。我忙拔出吴振昌的步枪刺刀，猛劲挖起来，起初还觉得冻手，后来啥也不知道了。挖了一大堆土块，我手心打了个血泡。我们把土块压在防空洞顶上，又扬上些雪粉，我仔细端详一番，又牢固又不容易暴露目标，我高兴地说：“敌人有炮弹他就打吧！”
    “班长，你有烟吗？”吴振昌实在想抽烟了。
    我顺手掏出那把保存了二十多天没舍得抽的烟末，让他到防空洞里去吸，我替他们监视着敌人。
    我抱着自动步枪坐在洞口上，伸手揉着枯干的眼睛。吴振昌手拿卷烟笑着说：“我们二十多天没捞到一滴水喝，炒面充饥，雪水解渴，你说毛主席知道不？”
    “当然知道啰，柴川若同志不是回国作报告去了吗！听说毛主席亲自和他谈了话，啥也打听到咧！”没等我说完，他俩齐声说：“对！我们一定要立国际功给咱祖国争光荣！”我说：“这可是立功的节骨眼啦，为了祖国美好的明天，我们不能后退一步，要坚决守住阵地！”吴振昌捏灭烟头说：“只要有咱人在，怎么也得守住阵地！就是牺牲了，我相信，阵地也一定是咱们的。对吧？班长。”我点了点头。
    我回到工事里，心中翻腾起来。我想：“光死打硬拚总不行啊，得琢磨个办法守住阵地才对。”根据几次战斗的经验，我知道鬼子最怕近战；我们经过了一天的战斗，子弹已经不多了，正好用手榴弹消灭敌人。同志们是会沉着大胆的跟敌人干的，鬼子上来再多也没有问题。我心里有了底，呼地站起来，命令吴振昌：“你给李万富同志说，手榴弹全摆在工事前，等敌人靠近，听我口令一齐打！”说完，我把我的二十多颗手榴弹全摆在工事前：“上来吧！让你尝尝中国人的‘铁元宵’！”
    风传来了炮弹出口声，山头上又有几处炸得焦黑。
    时间不长，几十个长腿鬼子背着卡宾枪摸上来了。起初他们很小心，分成几路进攻，后来见我们一枪没放，胆子就大了，又搬出了老一套的“羊群战术”。近了，连军官的叫骂声也听到了，有十来个鬼子已经跑到离我们二十多米的地方。这时，我身上像触了电，往高一蹦，抛出颗手榴弹，大喊一声：“打！”手榴弹就像冰雹一样地飞出去了。弹皮石块腾空而起，立刻传来鬼子的惨叫声；沾着血肉的罗斯福呢衣服，也挂满了树枝。
    鬼子尝够了“铁元宵”的味道，留下二十多个尸体，唧哩咕噜地滚下山去了。
    我觉着脑袋发沉，用手一摸，吓！是血。啊，挂花啦。吴振昌跑过来给我包扎，他说：“可能是石头崩的，伤口挺长……”我明白他的意思，微笑一下说：“我还没觉疼呢！”说实在话，头痛得嗡嗡直叫，我对同志撒了谎。我怎么能下去呢，现在一个人顶十几个人用，连炊事员同志还守山头呢！我还能够抛手榴弹，我清楚地记得我的誓言，下定了决心，只要有这口气在，就要带领全班挡住鬼子的进攻！
    手榴弹打光了。敌人一定会在拂晓进行攻击。我忍住头痛，撑着身子跑出工事，想找排长谈谈情况，可巧碰上了指导员。我们在雪地上坐下来。指导员对我说：“敌人纠集很大的兵力，准备向我滩头阵地猛扑，你班的阵地很重要，如果失守……”我立正站在指导员面前说：“我是个共产党员，我向您表示态度，只要我有这口气在，就能带领全班打垮美国强盗！请您放心，我们绝不会给祖国丢脸！”
    “好，这是事务班保存的手榴弹，还有十五个反坦克雷，是指定让你抛的！”他又指着背后同来的十多个人说：“这是机枪连的同志，配合你们的班打！”最后指导员握着我的手严肃地说：“同志，是钢是铁就在这会儿考验，争取时间，一定战斗到明天！”我给指导员敬了个礼，然后把机枪连的同志们送到工事里。
    同志们见了面都没啃气，只是握了一下手，便进入指定位置。
    这回我和吴振昌两人守一个工事。瞅着脚下的悬崖，我想起给地主放羊那年，就是被这样陡的山上滚下来的石头打伤了腿，半年多才养好。鬼子一定由这儿往上冲，我把大石头摆在工事前，等他爬到半山腰就把石头推下去，不是也能打击敌人吗！想到这里我就站起来了，吴振昌扯住我的胳膊问：
    “你干啥去？”我笑着说：“搬石头砸鬼子！”于是他也跟了出来。山上石头很多，同志们看出窍门来啦，就都跳出工事搬石头。一会儿，工事前就排成一道长长的石头墙。
    贴树梢飞来八架野马式飞机，一阵轮番轰炸扫射，雪山顿时变成了火山，松枝打落一地。接着，按照老规矩，又是一阵排子炮，震得大地好像是在幌荡。
    吴振昌说：“下马威过去咧，又该挨咱们的揍了！”同志们一个个抖起精神，瞪大眼睛监视着山下。
    大约有两个连左右的敌人，像半拉网似的往上兜。这群笨猪，用四个蹄子往上爬，脚一滑便闹个“狗抢屎”，滚下去了，爬三四次才到山腰。
    我们开火了！首先把石头推下去，机枪跟着也哗哗地响起来，我顺手送出几颗手榴弹，打得鬼子们连滚带爬地忙跑到崖下躲起来。过了一会，敌人又用一个多营的兵力，漫山遍野扑上来。
    我们的六零炮也开火了！炮弹在敌群里开花，机枪暴雨似的打过去。打得兴起，我高声喊道：“狠狠地打，这正是手榴弹吃肉的时候！”黑烟和着雪粉弥漫天空，鬼子有能力把咱阵地轰成黑色，咱们就有把握把他们进攻的道路变成红色！当我抛出最后的四颗手榴弹时，一多半鬼子躺在山腰上了；剩下的鬼子已经冲到阵地前。我胸中烧起了怒火，拿起铁锹飞快跳出工事，高声喊道：“为了祖国！”我第一锹劈倒一个鬼子指挥官；连着又摔倒另一个鬼子，用锹砸烂了他的脑瓜。但是，我的脖子也给一双毛茸茸的大手从背后卡住了。我使尽了力气也翻不过身来，这时，忽听背后“嗳哟”地叫了一声，那双大手撒开了，我回身一看，吴振昌端着刺刀站在我身旁，鬼子被他刺死了。
    那边三个鬼子正在扭着李万富同志打交手仗。我们赶紧奔过去。可是迟了，只听轰隆一声巨响，腾起一团黑烟，李万富同志搂住三个鬼子，拉响了最后的一颗手榴弹。
    太阳吐红了，金光映着雪野。美国鬼子横七竖八地躺了满山，侥幸活命的也像丧家狗似地夹着尾巴向南逃窜了。
    我们的大炮怒吼了！啊，后续部队到了。我站立不稳，两腿一软坐到地上。指导员不知道什么时候已经站在我身边，用手抚摸着我头上绷带说：“王玉同志，你负伤不下火线，带领全班积极想办法，勇敢打垮敌人八次冲锋，上级决定给你记两大功！”
    我兴奋得忘了头疼，说：“指导员，我得出一条经验：用勇敢打击敌人，用机智打击敌人，胜利总是我们的！”
