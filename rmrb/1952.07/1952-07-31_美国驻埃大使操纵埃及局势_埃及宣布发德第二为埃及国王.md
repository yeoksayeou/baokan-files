    Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th: TASS, London, July 28th - The "Daily Worker's" editorial commenting on the Egyptian events stated: "People suspect that Naguib has close ties with the American Embassy." The diplomatic correspondent of the "Times" also emphasized this point, writing: "Regarding the crisis in Egypt, the British Foreign Office and the American Embassy maintain frequent contact. Since the day of the coup, the American Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, has been the central figure in Egyptian diplomatic activities. He was at the dock to see Farouk off when he left Egypt on July 26th." The Cairo correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" stated: "The American Ambassador maintains extremely close contact with the palace, with Naguib in the headquarters, and with Maher in the heavily guarded government building." As can be seen from the report of the "Times" correspondent in Washington, Naguib may drag the Egyptian government into the Middle East Command. The report said: American officials' comments on the situation in Egypt are in a "relatively optimistic tone," and they pointed out: "The new military leaders may be more concerned about participating in the Middle East Command than the previous leaders, at least."
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 29th: TASS, Beirut, July 28th - According to Egyptian newspapers and radio broadcasts: The Egyptian government has announced Ahmed Fuad II (the seven-month-old prince of former King Farouk) as "King of Egypt and Sudan." The report pointed out: Former King Farouk has handed over a sealed list of members of the Regency Council to the Egyptian Prime Minister Maher. According to the Constitution, this sealed list must be opened in the presence of members of both houses of parliament. Until the Regency Council is finally appointed, the government will exercise the powers of the King as stipulated by the Constitution.
    According to Beirut Radio, the British military headquarters has transferred its naval and land forces from Malta and Cyprus to the Suez Canal area.

    美国驻埃大使操纵埃及局势
    埃及宣布发德第二为埃及国王
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：“工人日报”评论埃及事件的社论写道：“人们怀疑纳吉布和美国大使馆有密切联系。”“泰晤士报”的外交评论员也着重指出了这一点，他写道：“关于埃及的危机，英国外交部和美国大使馆保持着经常的联系。自从政变那天起，美国驻埃及大使加佛利已经成为埃及外交活动的中心人物，七月二十六日法鲁克离开埃及的时候，他曾到码头送行。”“每日电讯晨邮报”驻开罗记者称：“美国大使和皇宫，和司令部的纳吉布，和警卫森严的政府大厦中的马赫尔保持极为密切的联系。”从“泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者的报道中可以看出，纳吉布可能把埃及政府拖入中东司令部去。报道说：美国官方人士对埃及局势的评论带着“比较乐观的调子”，他们指出：“新的军队领袖们对参加中东司令部一事至少可能要比以前的领袖们更为关心些。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特二十八日讯：据埃及报纸和广播消息：埃及政府已宣布阿赫迈德·发德第二（前国王法鲁克的七个月的皇子）为“埃及与苏丹国王”。消息指出：前国王法鲁克已将摄政委员会委员名单密封交给埃及首相马赫尔。根据宪法，这个密封名单必须当着议会两院议员的面拆开。在摄政委员会最后被任命以前，将由政府执行宪法规定的国王职权。
    据贝鲁特广播，英军司令部已将海陆军由马耳他和塞浦路斯两岛调至苏彝士运河区域。
