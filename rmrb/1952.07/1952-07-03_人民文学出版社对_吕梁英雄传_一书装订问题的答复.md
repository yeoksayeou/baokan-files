    People's Literature Publishing House's Reply Regarding the Binding Issues of "Heroes of Lüliang"

    Editor: In the "Letters from Readers" column of the June 17th People's Daily, Comrade Yu Naifeng's letter pointed out that the binding of the "Heroes of Lüliang" (first edition after resetting) published by our publishing house was not strong, with broken threads and cracks. This is true. This is the result of the binding workshop's irresponsible work and our own insufficiently strict inspection of finished products. The binding of the second edition of the book has been improved, and we are also working hard to improve the binding of all other books. We are grateful to Comrade Yu for his criticism, and we will be more serious in overcoming shortcomings in our work in the future. After seeing this letter, Comrade Yu is requested to send the cracked book back to our publishing house for rebinding, or exchange it for the second edition of the book. All return postage will be borne by our publishing house.

    If other readers find similar problems with books published by our publishing house, we hope they will immediately write to us or send the books back for exchange, and the postage will be borne by our publishing house.

    人民文学出版社对“吕梁英雄传”一书装订问题的答复
    编辑同志：六月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载于乃丰同志来信，指出我社出版的“吕梁英雄传”（重排后第一版）装订不牢，有断线裂开的情形，这是事实。这是装订所工作不负责任，我们自己检查成品太不严格的结果。该书第二版的装订已有改进，其它一切书籍的装订我们也都在努力改进中。我们感激于同志对我们的批评，今后当更认真克服工作上的缺点。请于同志见信后，即将裂开的书寄回我社重新装订，或调换该书的第二版，往返寄费概由我社负担。
    其他读者如发现我社出书有和以上类似情形，也希望立刻函告我们，或将书寄回调换，寄费由我社负担。
                          人民文学出版社
