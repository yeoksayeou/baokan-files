Alan Winnington and Wilfred Burchett
Expose US Conspiracy to Torture and Detain POWs
(Xinhua News Agency, July 12th) Alan Winnington, reporter for the London "Daily Worker," and Wilfred Burchett, reporter for the Paris "Ce Soir," reported from Panmunjom on July 11th: The United States seems to be brewing a new, large-scale crisis in Korea. Although the administrative meetings here have not released any news, according to a Reuters reporter, well-informed American sources are telling UN reporters "not to be optimistic." In fact, this well-informed source is the American official spokesman, Nuckols. This American action has already violated the strict confidentiality agreement of the current meetings. At the same time, Van Fleet, free from other administrative responsibilities, can freely "actively prosecute" the Korean War. The prisoners on the Korean peninsula—previously declared to be anti-communist—are encountering new atrocities. All these ominous signs reveal the intentions of the Americans. The recent atrocities suffered by the Korean prisoners of war are further proof that the Americans still want to cling to their monstrous lies, saying that the prisoners do not want to go home, so that they can detain a large number of prisoners of war. No two of the reports published by some British and American news agencies are consistent on any point. But all these reports are issued by American officials, because the order prohibiting reporters from visiting prisoners is still in effect. According to Reuters, the recent bloody incident in Nonsan occurred after midnight, and was a "brawl between prisoners classified as opposed to repatriation," and the United States claimed it did not know the reason for their fighting. However, the Associated Press reported: "American guards yesterday entered a camp occupied by a group of rioting Communist prisoners and injured twenty-four prisoners while suppressing the demonstration." United Press also said:
    "In a camp detaining North Korean prisoners of war who claim to be anti-communists, twenty-four Communist prisoners were injured." Some reports said that American soldiers used tear gas and bayonets, while others said that they did not. These worthless reports have only one thing in common: North Korean prisoners who were classified as "refusing repatriation" by the United States were injured because they refused to be forcibly detained by the United States. Another item has therefore been added to the mountain of evidence, which shows that prisoners of war who want to return home are still suffering from unknown atrocities, the purpose of which is to force them to remain in the hands of their enemies. This is tantamount to poking a hole in the tent, letting the world see that the Americans are obviously still determined to detain prisoners as slaves, and this further explains why Nuckols warned UN reporters not to be optimistic.
    Most reports mentioned that sixteen mysterious "prisoners" crawled out from under the barbed wire (which was previously said to be only knee-high) and surrendered to American soldiers. Anyone familiar with the situation at the Nonsan prisoner-of-war camp would naturally suspect that these people are not prisoners, but henchmen of the Syngman Rhee gang. The prisoner-of-war camp employs thousands of these types of guys, who specialize in beating prisoners who want to go home with clubs.

    阿兰·魏宁顿和贝却敌
    揭露美方残害和扣留战俘阴谋
    【新华社十二日讯】据伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿和巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十一日自板门店报道：美国似乎正在朝鲜酝酿一次新的、大规模的危机。虽然这里的行政性会议还没有发布什么消息，但是据路透社记者说，美国的消息灵通人士叫联合国记者们“不要乐观”。事实上，这个消息灵通人士就是美国的官方发言人纳科斯。美国的这个行动已经违反了目前会议的严格保密的协议。同时，范佛里特不负其他行政责任，可以放手“积极进行”朝鲜战争了。朝鲜大陆上的俘虏——据从前宣布是反共的——遭遇了新的暴行。从这一切不祥的迹象可以看出美国人的意图。最近朝鲜俘虏遭遇的暴行再度证明美国人还是想一口咬定他们撒下的弥天大谎，说俘虏们不愿意回家，以便他们大批扣留战俘。一些英美通讯社发表的消息从没有两条是在任何一点上一致的。但是所有这些消息都是由美国官方发出来的，因为禁止记者访问俘虏的命令现在仍然有效。据路透社的消息说，最近论山的血腥事件是在午夜以后发生的，是“归入反对遣返一类的”俘虏间的互殴，而且美国自称不知道他们斗殴的原因。但是，美联社的消息却说：“美国看守兵昨天开进一群闹乱子的共产党俘虏所居住的营场，在压平示威时击伤了二十四名俘虏。”合众社也说：
    “在拘留自称是反共分子的北朝鲜战俘的营场，有二十四名共产党俘虏受伤。”有些消息说，美国兵使用了催泪瓦斯弹和刺刀，又有些消息说，他们没有使用。这些一文钱不值的消息只有一点是共同的，就是：被美国归入“拒绝遣返”一类的北朝鲜俘虏因为拒绝被美国强迫拘留而受了伤。堆积如山的证据里面因此又加上了一项，它说明：希望回家的战俘仍然在遭受人所不知的暴行，施以这种暴行的目的就是要强迫他们留在他们的敌人手里。这无异在帐篷上戳了一个窟窿，让世人看见了美国人显然还是决心要把俘虏扣留起来当作奴隶，而且这更进一步地说明了为什么纳科斯警告联合国记者们，叫他们不要乐观。
    多数消息曾提到，十六个神秘的“俘虏”从铁丝网下面（从前据说这个俘虏营的铁丝网只有膝盖那样高）爬出来向美国兵投降。熟悉论山俘虏营情况的人自然会怀疑到这些人不是俘虏，而是李承晚匪帮的喽啰们。俘虏营雇用了几千个这一类的家伙，专门用大头棒殴打希望回家的俘虏。
