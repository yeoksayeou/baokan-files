Since the large-scale patriotic health campaign was launched in Northeast China in March of this year, the environmental sanitation in urban and rural areas, as well as the personal hygiene of the people, have been significantly improved.

The scale of this year's patriotic health campaign is unprecedented in history. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of June: six provinces and five cities in the region have removed a total of 3,717,300+ tons of garbage and 9,673,800+ tons of manure; newly built and renovated more than 646,400 toilets and 289,700+ wells. People in various places have vigorously carried out work such as dredging ditches, filling in puddles, repairing roads, clearing weeds, and renovating livestock pens. In order to eliminate vector insects and animals of various infectious diseases, the people of the entire region captured more than 10,036,780 rats in March and April alone. In Shenyang City alone, more than 3,400 catties of flies and various insects were killed in twenty days in May. Various places have also thoroughly rectified the household and personal hygiene of residents. According to incomplete statistics from Jinzhou City in May, citizens of the city washed more than 300,000 cotton clothes and quilts in one month. The hygiene work of the food industry in various cities has also been greatly strengthened.

The extent to which the people of various places participated in this campaign exceeded any previous year.

At the same time, this patriotic health campaign was carried out more thoroughly than any previous one. More than 90% of the residents in various cities in the region have cleaned their houses. Shenyang City cleaned up eight large garbage dumps that had accumulated for six to twenty years in the city and suburbs, and transported more than 15,380 tons of garbage. In the Xin抚 district of Fushun City, Qinren Street mobilized more than 10,000 residents and completely cleared more than 3,000 tons of garbage that had accumulated for more than 30 years in six hours. By the end of May, the city had carried out three major cleanups throughout the city. During the cleaning campaign, the citizens of Andong City put forward the slogan of "major furniture overhaul, no dust indoors." Many households moved boxes, cabinets, tables and chairs outdoors and even to the Yalu River for thorough cleaning, and generally achieved "eight lights" that covered all aspects: up, down, left, right, front, back, inside and out.

Through this patriotic health campaign, many residents in urban and rural areas of the region have developed good hygiene habits. For example, the residents of the 29th group of Rixinfang in Dalian City not only sweep the floor every day, but also wash it with water every two or three days. Farmers in Guojiafang, Ganjingzi District, a suburb of Dalian City, have changed their habit of drinking cold water for many years and carry a pot of boiled water with them when they go to the fields or mountains. A woman surnamed Xie from Dehe Street, Wafangdian Town, Fuxian County, Liaodong Province, said: "I sweep and wipe every day, and I am used to being clean; if I don't do it one day, I feel uncomfortable as if I have lost something!"

The patriotic health campaign in urban and rural areas has had a good impact on production and construction. For example, since March, the number of sick employees in Shenyang Smelting Plant has decreased by 10% compared with February, and the attendance rate has also increased relatively. After improving the hygiene work of a printing factory in Shenyang, the proportion of "sick numbers" in the factory has dropped from 17% to 2% of the number of employees, and the workers' production enthusiasm has generally increased. The patriotic health campaign in rural areas not only guarantees the physical health of farmers, but also promotes the accumulation of fertilizer in rural areas. After Xinglong District, Changchun County, Jilin Province launched the patriotic health campaign, the area of cultivated land fertilized increased from 58% to 82% in the past. Due to the construction of pigpens and toilets in Sidaohe Village, Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, the women in the whole village accumulated more than 40,000 catties of manure fertilizer.

    东北全区开展大规模的爱国卫生运动
    东北全区自今年三月开展大规模爱国卫生运动以来，城市和农村的环境卫生以及人民群众的个人卫生状况都有了显著改进。
    今年爱国卫生运动的巨大规模在历史上是空前未有的。截至六月底止的不完全统计：全区六省、五市共清除垃圾三百七十一万七千三百余吨，粪便九百六十七万三千八百余吨；新建和改修的厕所六十四万六千四百余个，水井二十八万九千七百余口。各地人民都大力进行了疏通水沟，填平水坑，翻修道路，清除杂草，修整畜圈等工作。为了消灭各种传染疾病的媒介昆虫和动物，全区人民仅在三、四两月内即捕鼠一千零三十六万七千八百多只。沈阳市一地，在五月份二十天内，捕灭苍蝇和各种昆虫三千四百多斤。各地还彻底整顿了居民的家庭卫生和个人卫生。据锦州市五月份不完全统计，该市市民在一个月内共拆洗棉衣和被褥达三十万件以上。各城市的饮食行业的卫生工作也大大加强。
    各地人民群众参加这次运动的广泛程度，超过以往的任何一年。
    同时，这次爱国卫生运动进行得比从前任何一次都更为彻底。全区各城市中百分之九十以上的居民都进行了屋内的清扫。沈阳市清除了市内和市郊积存达六年到二十年的八个大垃圾堆，共运出垃圾一万五千三百八十多吨。抚顺市新抚区亲仁街动员了一万多居民，在六个小时内就全部清除了积存达三十多年的三千多吨垃圾。该市到五月底止，已在全市范围内进行了三次大扫除。安东市市民在清扫运动中提出了“家具大翻身，室内无灰尘”的口号，很多住户都将箱柜桌椅搬到户外甚至鸭绿江边去彻底洗刷，并普遍做到上、下、左、右、前、后、里、外面面俱到的“八光”。
    经过这一次爱国卫生运动，全区城市和乡村的很多居民已养成了良好的卫生习惯。例如大连市日新坊第二十九组的居民不仅天天扫地，每隔两三天还要用水洗刷一次。大连市郊甘井子区郭家坊农民已改变了多年来喝冷水的习惯，下地上山都带着一壶凉开水。辽东省复县瓦房店镇德和街一位姓谢的妇女说：“每天扫一扫，擦一擦，干净惯了；有一天不做，就像丢了一件东西那样不好受！”
    各地城市和农村的爱国卫生运动，已经在生产建设工作中起了良好的影响。例如沈阳冶炼厂自三月份起，职工生病人数已较二月份减少了百分之十，出勤率也相对地提高了。沈阳某印刷厂在改进卫生工作后，全厂的“病号”占职工人数的比例，已由百分之十七下降到百分之二，工人生产情绪普遍上升。爱国卫生运动在农村中，不仅保证了农民的身体健康，还推动了农村的积肥工作。吉林长春县兴隆区开展爱国卫生运动后，耕地施肥面积已由过去的百分之五十八提高到百分之八十二。辽东省临江县四道河村由于修了猪圈厕所，仅全村妇女所积粪肥就有四万多斤。        （新华社）
