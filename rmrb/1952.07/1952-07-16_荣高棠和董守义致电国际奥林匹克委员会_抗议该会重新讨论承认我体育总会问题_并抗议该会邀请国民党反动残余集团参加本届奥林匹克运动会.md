Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the All-China Athletic Federation, and Dong Shouyi, member of the International Olympic Committee, telegraphed Edström, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, and the International Olympic Committee on the 14th, protesting the inclusion of the so-called recognition of the All-China Athletic Federation as the Chinese Olympic Committee on the agenda for re-discussion at the 47th International Olympic Committee meeting to be held in Helsinki on July 16, and the invitation of athletes from the reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan to participate in the 15th Olympic Games starting on July 19.

Rong Gaotang pointed out: The All-China Athletic Federation (i.e., the Chinese Olympic Committee) was reorganized from the All-China Athletic Association, which was previously recognized by the International Olympic Committee. It is the only legal national amateur sports organization in the People's Republic of China, exercising jurisdiction over sports activities nationwide, and has continued to participate in relevant international sports federations. Based on these facts, the All-China Athletic Federation undoubtedly should be recognized by the International Olympic Committee as continuing to be the Chinese Olympic Committee. However, the inclusion of the so-called request for recognition of the All-China Athletic Federation as the Chinese Olympic Committee on the agenda of the International Olympic Committee meeting held in Helsinki for re-discussion is completely unnecessary and unreasonable. We express our firm opposition to the introduction of this item.

Rong Gaotang also stated: Only the national amateur sports organization organized by the Chinese people themselves and representing all the Chinese people—the All-China Athletic Federation—can represent the Chinese people in the International Olympic Committee and its recognized international sports federations. The reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan has long been spurned by all the Chinese people and denied by fair-minded people all over the world. Therefore, the reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan is not qualified to represent the Chinese people in any international sports organizations, meetings, or sports activities, and it is even more intolerable for it to steal the name of the All-China Athletic Association and the Chinese Olympic Committee to carry out illegal activities. We protest the International Olympic Committee's invitation to athletes from the reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan to participate in the 15th Olympic Games; we firmly demand the immediate expulsion of the sports organization of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique in Taiwan. The rights of the All-China Athletic Federation (Chinese Olympic Committee) in the International Olympic Committee and various international sports federations must not be violated by anyone.

Dong Shouyi said in his protest telegram: H.H. Kung, who is now in exile in New York, and Wang Zhengting in Hong Kong have long been spurned by the Chinese people and the sports community, and are not qualified to continue to be members of the International Olympic Committee on behalf of the Chinese people. They are no longer able to perform their duties as members. According to Article 11 of the Olympic Charter and to maintain the dignity of the International Olympic Committee, I firmly request the cancellation of the membership of H.H. Kung and Wang Zhengting. Regarding Edström's invitation to him to go to Helsinki, Dong Shouyi said: If the International Olympic Committee immediately expels the sports organization of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique in Taiwan, continues to recognize the All-China Athletic Federation, and accepts the athletes sent by the All-China Athletic Federation to participate in the 15th Olympic Games, I will go to Helsinki with our athletes. Now I entrust Sheng Zhi Bai as my representative, please contact him.

    荣高棠和董守义致电国际奥林匹克委员会
    抗议该会重新讨论承认我体育总会问题
    并抗议该会邀请国民党反动残余集团参加本届奥林匹克运动会
    【新华社十五日讯】中华全国体育总会秘书长荣高棠和国际奥林匹克委员会委员董守义在十四日致电国际奥林匹克委员会主席艾德斯特隆并国际奥林匹克委员会，对七月十六日在赫尔辛基召开的第四十七届国际奥林匹克委员会及七月十九日开始的第十五届奥林匹克运动会将所谓承认中华全国体育总会为中国奥林匹克委员会问题列入议程重新讨论和邀请台湾中国国民党反动残余集团的运动员参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会，提出抗议。荣高棠指出：中华全国体育总会（即中国奥林匹克委员会）系由国际奥林匹克委员会所承认之前中华全国体育协进会改组而成，是中华人民共和国唯一合法的全国性业余体育运动组织，对全国范围内体育运动行使管辖权，并继续参加了各有关国际运动联合会。根据这些事实，中华全国体育总会无疑地完全应该被国际奥林匹克委员会承认继续为中国奥林匹克委员会。但是在赫尔辛基此次举行的国际奥林匹克委员会议议程中，却将所谓要求承认中华全国体育总会为中国奥林匹克委员会列入议程，提出重新讨论，这是完全不必要并且不合理的。我们对此项议题的提出，表示坚决的反对。荣高棠并声明：只有中国人民自己组织起来的并代表着全中国人民的全国性业余体育组织——中华全国体育总会——才能代表中国人民参加国际奥林匹克委员会及其所承认的各国际运动联合会。台湾中国国民党反动残余集团早已为全中国人民所唾弃和全世界公正人士所否认，因此台湾中国国民党反动残余集团已没有资格代表中国人民参加任何国际体育组织、会议及体育活动，更不容许它盗用中华全国体育协进会及中国奥林匹克委员会的名义进行非法活动。我们对国际奥林匹克委员会邀请了台湾中国国民党反动残余集团的运动员参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会表示抗议；我们坚决要求立即驱逐台湾国民党反动残余集团的体育组织。中华全国体育总会（中国奥林匹克委员会）在国际奥林匹克委员会及各国际运动联合会的一切权利绝不容许任何人侵犯。
    董守义在抗议电中说：现潜逃在纽约的孔祥熙和在香港的王正廷早已为中国人民与体育界所唾弃，没有任何资格代表中国人民继续为国际奥林匹克委员会委员，他们已不能履行其委员的职责。根据奥林匹克章程第十一条的规定和保持国际奥委会的尊严，我坚决要求取消孔祥熙、王正廷的委员资格。董守义对艾德斯特隆邀请他去赫尔辛基事说：国际奥林匹克委员会如果立即驱逐台湾国民党反动残余集团的体育组织，继续承认中华全国体育总会并接纳中华全国体育总会所派遣参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会的运动员，我将与我们的运动员前往赫尔辛基。现在我委托盛之白为我的代表，请与之接洽。
