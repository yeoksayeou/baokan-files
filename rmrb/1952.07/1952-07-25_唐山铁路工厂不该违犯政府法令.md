    Tangshan Railway Factory Should Not Violate Government Decrees
    Editor: The administrative leaders of Tangshan Railway Factory disregarded the government's regulations on the use of power grids, resulting in an accident where a worker was electrocuted by the power grid. On July 15th, the Tangshan Construction Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau sent construction workers to repair the roof of a toilet in the Railway Public Security Section. This toilet was right next to the wall of the Tangshan Railway Factory. An electric grid was installed on the wall with a 3,300-volt current, but there were no warning signs. While repairing the roof workers Zhao Qinggeng and Geng Ming'en found an old iron bed frame and needed to move it before working. While lifting the bed, the iron bed touched the power grid, and these two workers were electrocuted and died.
    The Tangshan Railway Factory is located in the city, and there is no need to turn on the power grid during the day, and it wastes electricity. In the past, this power grid has electrocuted people several times, but the factory's leaders have turned a blind eye. As a result, the 3,300-volt current has been continuously flowing day and night. The Tangshan Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau published "Tangshan Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau Provisional Measures for the Management of Power Grids" in the Labor Daily on June 22nd, stipulating that those with power grid equipment must apply for registration, and stipulating that in summer the power grid operating hours are from 9 pm to 5 am. The factory turned a blind eye to this government decree, and had not complied with the regulations for more than 20 days.
    I believe that the administrative leaders of the Tangshan Railway Factory's disregard for national laws is the main cause of this electrocution accident. I suggest that the Tianjin Railway Bureau quickly handle this incident to prevent similar accidents from happening again.            Yang Zifeng

### 唐山铁路工厂不该违犯政府法令

    唐山铁路工厂不该违犯政府法令
    编辑同志：唐山铁路工厂行政领导干部不遵守人民政府关于使用电网的规定，以致发生电网电死工人的事故。七月十五日，天津铁路管理局唐山建筑驻在所，派建筑工人到铁路公安段修理厕所屋顶，这个厕所紧靠着唐山铁路工厂的墙壁，墙壁上安着电网，并有三千三百伏特电压的电流，但没有注明标志。工友赵庆庚、耿鸣恩在厕所房顶上发现有旧铁床面一个，必须先把床抬下才能工作。在抬床时，铁床碰到电网，这两位工友就触电死亡。
    唐山铁路工厂设在市内，在白天开电网没有必要，并且浪费电流。过去这电网曾几次电死人，而该厂领导干部不闻不问，因之电网上就一直日夜不停地开放着三千三百伏特电压的电流。唐山市人民政府公安局曾于六月二十二日在劳动日报公布“唐山市人民政府公安局管理电网暂行办法”，规定有电网设备的必须申请登记，并规定在夏季电网开放时间为晚九点至晨五点。该厂对于政府这个法令熟视无睹，二十多天来，并未按照规定办理。
    我认为唐山铁路工厂行政领导干部漠视国家法令，是造成这次触电事故的主要原因。我建议天津铁路管理局赶快处理这一事件，防止以后再有类似事故发生。            杨紫枫
