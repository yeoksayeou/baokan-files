Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 26th – The Chinese delegation attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference arrived in Toronto on the morning of the 24th. The delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also arrived at the same time. Bashkov, representative of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, and representatives of the Canadian Red Cross Society welcomed them at the airport. At the executive meeting of the 22nd Council of the League of Red Cross Societies on the 25th, the Chinese Red Cross delegation voted against allowing West Germany to participate as a member of the League, because West Germany does not constitute a country, and participation is procedurally inappropriate and violates the regulations. During the discussion of the relief work report, the Indian delegation expressed gratitude for the donations from the Chinese Red Cross Society to the Indian people in its speech.

Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 26th – On the eve of the first plenary session of the 18th International Red Cross Conference, François-Poncet, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross, confirmed to reporters that the Standing Committee had decided to grant the remnants of the Kuomintang elements in Taiwan the same "equal" status as the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. Su Jingguan, head of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Li Dequan, head of the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society, already lodged a strong protest on the 25th against this illegal decision, which violates the regulations of the International Red Cross and has a destructive effect. The full text of the protest letter is as follows:

It has been learned that the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross decided on July 24 that the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan will enjoy the same "equal" status as the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China at the 18th International Red Cross Conference. This decision is without any reason or basis. The delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference hereby express their strongest opposition to this decision.

As is well known, whether in fact or in law, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing China. It has received the unanimous support of the entire Chinese people. This government has liberated all Chinese territory except for the isolated island of Taiwan. Only due to the open military intervention of the United States government, which is hostile to the Chinese people, has the liberation of Taiwan been forcibly delayed. A small group of Kuomintang remnants who fled to Taiwan Island and rely on American protection have long been spurned and hated by the Chinese people. They are not qualified to represent the Chinese people either in fact or in law. Obviously, there is only one government in China, and that government is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Only the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has the right to represent China in various international conferences, including the International Red Cross Conference. The Kuomintang remnants who were overthrown by the Chinese people have long lost their qualification to participate in any international conference. Allowing these people to participate in the International Red Cross Conference not only violates the regulations of the International Red Cross and international practice, but also constitutes an unfriendly gesture towards a legitimate member of the conference – the People's Republic of China – and towards the Chinese people.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has recognized the Chinese Red Cross Society as the only Red Cross Society in China. This fact has long been recognized by various international organizations of the Red Cross. No one has ever heard of any other "Red Cross organization" in China. Therefore, the conference should absolutely not recognize the personnel of the so-called Red Cross organization of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, which is using a false name and does not actually exist. Based on the reasons stated above, the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference strongly protest the unjust and illegal decision of the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross, and firmly demand that the Standing Committee immediately revoke the above decision and not allow the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, who shamelessly pretend to represent China, to participate in this conference.

Su Jingguan, Head of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China
Li Dequan, Head of the Delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society

### 我出席国际红十字大会代表团抵多伦多  对台湾残匪获准参加大会提出强硬抗议

    我出席国际红十字大会代表团抵多伦多
    对台湾残匪获准参加大会提出强硬抗议
    【新华社多伦多二十六日电】出席第十八届国际红十字大会的中国代表团在二十四日晨抵多伦多。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表也于同时抵达。苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会代表巴什科夫和加拿大红十字会代表都到机场欢迎。在二十五日红十字会协会第二十二届理事会的执行会议上，中国红十字会代表团投票反对允许西德参加为协会会员，因为西德不成其为一个国家，参加是不合程序而且违反规章的。在讨论救济工作的报告时，印度代表团在其发言中对于中国红十字会给印度人民的捐助表示感谢。
    【新华社多伦多二十六日电】第十八届国际红十字大会第一次全体会议的前夕，国际红十字常设委员会主席法朗索阿—庞赛向记者们证实，常设委员会已经决定给台湾残余的国民党分子以中华人民共和国政府代表团同样的“平等”地位。中国政府代表团团长苏井观与中国红十字会代表团团长李德全二十五日已经提出强硬的抗议，反对这一违犯国际红十字会规章并且发生破坏作用的非法决定。抗议书全文如下：
    据悉：国际红十字常设委员会于七月二十四日决定，在第十八届国际红十字大会中，台湾的国民党残余分子将享有中华人民共和国政府代表团同样的“平等”地位。这个决定是没有任何理由和根据的。出席第十八届国际红十字大会的中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团特对这个决定提出最坚决的反对。
    如所周知，无论在事实上或在法理上，中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国的唯一合法的政府。它获得了全中国人民的一致支持。这个政府已经解放了除台湾孤岛以外的全部中国领土。仅仅由于与中国人民为敌的美国政府的公开军事干涉，台湾的解放才被迫推迟。逃到台湾岛上依靠美国保护的一小撮国民党残余分子早已遭到中国人民的唾弃和憎恨，他们无论在事实上或在法理上都没有任何资格代表中国人民。很明显，中国只有一个政府，这个政府就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府。只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府才有权代表中国参加各种国际会议，包括国际红十字大会在内。被中国人民打倒了的国民党残余分子早已丧失了参加任何国际会议的资格。容许这些人参与国际红十字大会，不但违反了国际红十字会的规章和国际惯例，而且是对大会的一个合法成员——就是中华人民共和国——和对中国人民的一种不友好的表示。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府已承认中国红十字会是中国唯一的红十字会。这个事实久已为红十字会各国际组织所承认。根本没有任何人听说过中国还有任何其他的“红十字会组织”。因此，大会绝对不应该承认台湾国民党残余分子的所谓红十字会组织的人员，该组织是盗用名义，而且事实上根本不存在。根据以上所说的理由，参加第十八届国际红十字大会的中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团强硬抗议国际红十字常设委员会的不公正而且非法的决定，并坚决主张常设委员会立刻取消上述决定，不许无耻地冒充代表中国的台湾国民党残余分子参加这次大会。中华人民共和国代表团团长苏井观中国红十字会代表团团长李德全
            一九五二年七月二十五日
