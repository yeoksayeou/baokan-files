    Hoping Film Projection Teams Go to the Countryside More Often
    Editor: The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Transportation Department Propaganda Team brought films, slides, and other propaganda materials to our county. They screened the film "Liberated China," the slides "Aunt Huang" and "Catching a Turtle in a Jar," broadcasted many songs, and conducted propaganda work. This inspired the production enthusiasm of the masses and deepened their understanding of the revolution. Teng Zhaorong, a farmer from Cheng Guan Township, said: "Before liberation, we had never even heard the word 'film.' Now Chairman Mao has brought films to our doorstep. When I saw Chairman Mao in the film, I jumped for joy. I regretted not having more eyes, because after waiting so many years, I finally saw Chairman Mao in a film and heard his voice. In the future, I will strive to be a model worker and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" Wen Guangfa, a farmer from Hanwang Village in Chengguan District, said: "Before, someone told me about tractors plowing the land, and I didn't believe it. After watching the film, I really saw Chinese people using tractors to plow the land on Chinese land. It won't be possible for us to use tractors in the countryside all at once. We should first organize mutual aid teams to lay a good foundation for future collective farms." He Jinxian, the head of Chengguan Township, said: "The masses saw the greatness of our motherland and the development prospects of our country from the film. In the mutual aid team discussion meetings, the masses spoke with much more enthusiasm than before. They all set production increase plans, and their enthusiasm for production is also higher than before. This film propaganda in the countryside is more effective than us talking about it ten times over."
    Because the film was only shown in our county for one day, many villagers did not get to see it, and they regretted not seeing Chairman Mao. Our county is a mountainous area, and half of the population has never seen a car. Therefore, showing films here is very effective. We hope that film projection teams will go to the countryside more often.

    希望电影队多多下乡
    编辑同志：西北军政委员会交通部宣传队曾携带电影、幻灯等宣传品到我县来，先后放映了电影“解放了的中国”、幻灯片“黄大妈”和“瓮中捉鳖”，还播出很多歌曲，并进行了宣传工作，鼓舞了群众的生产情绪，加深了群众对革命的认识。我县城关乡农民腾兆荣说：“解放前咱们连‘电影’这个名字也没有听说过，现在毛主席把电影送到咱门口来演。当我在电影里看到毛主席的时候，我高兴得跳起来。当时我恨自己没有再多长出几只眼睛，因为盼了多少年了，今天才从电影里看见毛主席，听到了他的声音。今后我要争取做一个劳动模范到北京去见毛主席！”城关区汉王村农民文光发说：“以前有人对我说拖拉机耕地的事情，我不相信。看了电影后，我可真看到中国人在中国的田地上用拖拉机来耕地了。咱们农村使用拖拉机，不是一下子就可以的，咱们现在先组织好互助组，给将来的集体农庄打好根基。”城关乡乡长贺进贤说：“群众从电影里看到咱们祖国的伟大，也看到了咱们国家的发展前途，在互助组讨论会上，众群说话的劲头比以前可大得多了，他们都订了增产计划，生产的热情也比以前高了。这次电影下乡来宣传，比咱们光用嘴巴讲上十次收效都大。”
    因为电影在我县只演了一天，有很多老乡没有看到，他们很后悔没有看到毛主席。我县是个山区，有一半人口没有见过汽车。所以在这里放映电影收效是很大的。我们希望电影队多多下乡。
