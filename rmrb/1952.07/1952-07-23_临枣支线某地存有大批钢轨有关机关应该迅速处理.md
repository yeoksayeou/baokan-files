    A Large Quantity of Steel Rails Exists on the Linzao Branch Line in a Certain Location; Relevant Authorities Should Handle It Quickly

    A certain location on the Linzao (Lincheng-Zaozhuang) Branch Line, under the jurisdiction of the Jinan Railway Administration, still has over five thousand steel rails stored and not yet processed, which is a serious waste. In the spring of 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council allocated funds to the Ministry of Railways, instructing the Jinan Railway Administration to organize a "Road Material Collection Team" in the Linzao Branch Line area to collect steel rails scattered in the mountains by local farmers due to traffic sabotage during the revolutionary war. Except for a portion of these steel rails that were transferred to the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the remainder has been stored until now and has not been processed. The Materials Department of the Jinan Railway Administration has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Railways to handle these steel rails, but there has been no result. Now, some of the steel rails have sunk deep into the mud due to prolonged storage. We have recently done some sorting work, and the wage costs alone have amounted to four million yuan. According to our estimates, these steel rails weigh approximately 1,600 metric tons, and at an old product price of 3.4 million yuan per metric ton, they are worth a total of 5.44 billion yuan. Using these steel rails to build a new road could lay fifty li of track. We hope that the Ministry of Railways will promptly handle these steel rails to prevent further loss of useful state materials.

    临枣支线某地存有大批钢轨有关机关应该迅速处理
    济南铁路管理局所属临枣支线某地，至今还存放着五千多根钢轨没有处理，这是一种严重的浪费。一九五○年春季，政务院财经委员会曾拨款给铁道部，责成济南铁路管理局在临（城）枣（庄）支线一带组织“搜集路料队”，搜集在革命战争时期因当地农民爆破交通而疏散到山里的钢轨。这批钢轨除运拨天津路局一部分外，其余的存放至今，尚未处理。济南铁路管理局材料处曾多次要求铁道部处理这批钢轨，但一直没有结果。现在一部分钢轨因存放过久，已深陷泥中。我们在最近做了一些整理工作，仅工资费就花了四百万元。据我们估计，这批钢轨约重一千六百公吨，以旧品每公吨三百四十万元计算，共值五十四亿四千万元。用这批钢轨修建新路，可铺五十华里路轨。我们希望铁道部迅速处理这批钢轨，以免国家有用的物资继续遭受损失。
