Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th—The Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, the Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, the Communist Youth League Hunan Provincial Working Committee, and other organizations unanimously condemned the barbaric crime of US aircraft bombing the Yalu River Power Plant, and called on workers, women, and youth throughout the province to rise up and, together with peace-loving people all over the world, give the US aggressors a severe punishment for this crime. Song Xinhuai, chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, said in a written statement: "The US aggressors' renewed inhumane crime of bombing peaceful cities will only arouse the anger and hatred of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world, making US imperialism even more isolated in the eyes of the world's people. We, the working class of Hunan, on the one hand, are closely watching this new conspiracy of US imperialism to attempt to resume large-scale war, and will rise up to expose and stop this conspiracy. On the other hand, on the basis of the victory of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, we will launch a large-scale production increase and economy campaign to enhance the economic and defense strength of our motherland." The responsible persons of the Provincial Women's Federation and the Hunan Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League said in written statements: We, the women and youth of Hunan, will never allow the US aggressors to escape the responsibility they should bear for this crime.
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th—The US aggressors' frantic bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant, a non-military facility in Korea, has aroused great anger among the people of Tianjin. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Student Federation jointly issued a protest, stating: The US aggressors, in an attempt to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, dared to continuously bomb the Yalu River, Changjin River, Fujian River, Xuchuan River, and other hydroelectric power plants, with the Shuifeng Power Plant as the head, destroying the peaceful construction indispensable to the lives of the Korean people, vainly attempting to achieve their so-called "military pressure" to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people. This shameless means can only arouse the infinite resentment of the Chinese and Korean people and can only show the outward strength but inward weakness of US imperialism. All staff, workers, youth, women, and students in Tianjin deeply hate this despicable and barbaric act of US imperialism. All our city's staff and workers must mobilize actively to produce and strive to complete the task of increasing production and saving 50,000 billion yuan. All youth and women will also resolutely respond to the US aggressors' atrocities with practical actions. The Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Workers, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and medical circles and the Hui people also issued written statements one after another, condemning the despicable and barbaric behavior of the US aggressors.
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th—People from all walks of life in Guangzhou angrily protested against the unprecedented atrocities of the US aggressor army in continuously bombing power plants in the Yalu River and other places. Li Zhangda, chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association, said: "The US invading air force's frantic bombing of power plants in the Yalu River and other places fully exposes the US imperialists' conspiracy to deliberately disrupt the armistice negotiations and attempt to expand the Korean War. We, the people of Guangzhou, will never sit idly by and watch the realization of this conspiracy of the US aggressors. Our city's people are determined to make persistent efforts to support the Chinese and Korean troops with greater strength and give the US aggressors a severe punishment." Huang Minwei, director of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, pointed out: "What the US aggressors cannot obtain at the armistice negotiation table, they attempt to obtain by bombing power plants in the Yalu River and other places as a 'deterrent,' which is completely wishful thinking. The US aggressors must realize that any barbaric act will only arouse greater anger from the Chinese and Korean people and accelerate its own defeat. In the past, Guangzhou workers have put in a lot of effort to support the Chinese and Korean troops and the Korean people, and now they are vigorously carrying out the production increase and economy campaign to strengthen the force of Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. All the conspiracies and tricks played by US imperialism will surely be completely crushed in the face of the powerful force of the Chinese and Korean people!" Su Hui, director of the Guangzhou Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, and the responsible persons of the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association Preparatory Committee, the Guangzhou Democratic Youth Federation Preparatory Committee, the Guangzhou Student Federation, and other people's organizations also issued statements respectively, severely criticizing the US imperialists for this atrocity of destroying the peaceful life of the broad masses of the Korean people and completely violating humanity.

    湖南、天津和广州人民团体发表声明
    痛斥美国轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的野蛮罪行
    【新华社长沙三十日电】湖南省总工会筹委会、民主妇联筹委会、青年团湖南省工作委员会等团体一致痛斥美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的野蛮罪行，并号召全省工人、妇女、青年起来，和全世界爱好和平的人们一道，给美国侵略者的这一罪行以严厉的责罚。湖南省总工会筹委会主席宋新怀发表书面谈话说：“美国侵略者又一次违反人道轰炸和平城市的罪行，只有引起中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒与仇恨，使美帝国主义在世界人民面前更加陷于孤立。我们全湖南的工人阶级，一方面密切注视美帝国主义这一企图恢复大规模战争的新的阴谋，并起而揭发和制止这种阴谋，一方面在‘三反’、‘五反’运动胜利的基础上，开展大规模的增产节约运动，以增强我们祖国的经济力量和国防力量。”省妇联和青年团湖南省工委的负责人发表书面谈话说：我们全湖南的妇女和青年决不容许美国侵略者逃脱对这一罪行所应负的责任。
    【新华社天津三十日电】美国侵略者疯狂轰炸朝鲜非军事设备鸭绿江水力发电厂的暴行，激起了天津市人民极大的愤怒。天津市总工会、民主青年联合会、民主妇女联合会、学生联合会等四团体，联名发表抗议书称：美国侵略者企图拖延朝鲜停战谈判，竟敢连续轰炸以水丰发电厂为首的鸭绿江、长津江、赴战江、虚川江等水力发电厂，破坏朝鲜人民生活上不可缺少的和平建设，妄想达到他们所谓“军事压力”来恐吓朝中人民。这种无耻的手段只能激起朝中人民无限的愤恨，只能说明美帝国主义者的外强中干。天津市全体职工、青年、妇女、学生深恶痛绝美帝国主义者这一卑鄙野蛮的暴行。我们全市职工一定要动员起来，积极生产，为完成五万亿元的增产节约任务而斗争。全体青年、妇女也决以实际行动回击美国侵略者的暴行。天津市文学艺术工作者联合会、工商业联合会和医务界、回族人民也纷纷发表书面谈话，同声谴责美国侵略者这种卑鄙野蛮的行为。
    【新华社广州三十日电】广州市各界人民愤怒抗议美国侵略军连续轰炸鸭绿江等地发电厂的旷古未闻的暴行。广州市抗美援朝分会主席李章达说：“美国侵朝空军疯狂轰炸鸭绿江等地的发电厂，充分暴露了美帝国主义蓄意破坏停战谈判，企图扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。我们全广州人民决不能坐视美国侵略者这种阴谋的实现，我们全市人民决心再接再励，以更大的力量来支援中朝部队，给美国侵略者以严厉的惩罚。”广州市总工会筹备会主任黄民伟指出：“美国侵略者在停战谈判桌上所不能取得的东西，而企图用轰炸鸭绿江等地发电厂作为‘恫吓’手段来取得，这完全是一种妄想。美国侵略者必须认识，任何野蛮暴行只有激起中朝人民的更大愤怒和加速它自己的失败。广州市工人过去已经出了很大力量支援中朝部队和朝鲜人民，现在又正在大力开展增产节约运动，来增强抗美援朝力量。美帝国主义所耍的一切阴谋手段，一定在中朝人民的强大力量前面被彻底粉碎！”广州市民主妇女联合会筹备会主任苏蕙和广东省科学技术普及协会筹备会、广州市民主青年联合会筹备会、广州市学生联合会等人民团体的负责人也分别发表谈话，严斥美帝国主义这种破坏朝鲜广大人民和平生活、彻底违反人道的暴行。
