    The Fourth Work Zone of the Southern Anhui Forestry Company's Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting Forest Protection Work

    To the Editors: The letter from Comrade Wang Qifeng published in the Readers' Letters column of the People's Daily on May 27, criticizing our neglect of forest protection work, which led to a fire, is very accurate. The comrades in our work zone, from top to bottom, have rarely paid attention to forest protection work in the past. We only made general appeals for forest protection and fire prevention to the thousands of transport workers, without carrying out specific work. On weekdays, we simply carried out felling and did not clean up the branches, leaves, and bark discarded all over the mountains. On the morning of April 17, a transport worker smoked in the mountain area, igniting branches, bark, and leaves, which led to a major fire. After the fire, we absorbed the opinions and experience of the farmers and scraped off a piece of bark one foot above the ground from each burned fir tree (this is called "releasing fire poison"). Currently, these trees are gradually reviving. We have also carried out cleanup work in the unaffected forest areas to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Now we have learned our lesson, strengthened forest protection and fire prevention work, and have requested the higher authorities to give us the punishment we deserve.
    The area of this fire did not exceed three hundred mu. It is inaccurate to say in the criticism that it was four thousand mu. (Editor's note: Zhen Qingchuan, secretary of the Yixian County People's Government in Southern Anhui, also wrote to this newspaper, pointing out that two points in Comrade Wang Qifeng's criticism do not conform to the facts. First, the burned area actually did not exceed three hundred mu; second, the county magistrate of Yixian, the head of the construction section of the special commissioner's office, and the head of the public security department arrived at the fire scene the next day after the fire broke out. At that time, the fire had been extinguished. They held a workers' meeting in the work zone, commended those who had made achievements in fighting the fire, criticized those who had not done their best in fighting the fire, and arranged for follow-up work. It was not as the original criticism stated, that the county magistrate, the head of the construction section of the special commissioner's office, and the head of the public security department personally led more than four thousand cadres, masses, and armed personnel to rush to the rescue to put out the fire. This is hereby corrected.)

### 皖南林产公司第四工区关于不重视护林工作的检讨

    皖南林产公司第四工区关于不重视护林工作的检讨
    编辑同志：五月二十七日人民日报读者来信栏登载了汪奇峰同志对于我们不重视护林工作以致发生火灾的批评，这个批评非常正确。我们工区的工作同志，从上到下，过去很少注意护林工作。我们对于几千运输工人，只作了一般的护林防火的号召，没有进行具体的工作。平日我们只是单纯地进行砍伐，对于满山遍野抛弃的树枝树叶树皮，并未加以清理。四月十七日上午，运输工人在山场吸烟，燃及树枝树皮树叶，以致酿成大火。发生山火以后，我们吸收农民的意见和经验，在每棵烧过的杉树下部距离地面一尺高的地方，刮去一块树皮（这叫“放火毒”），目前这些树都已渐渐活了。我们在没有受灾的林区，也进行了清理工作，以防不测。现在我们已经接受了教训，加强了护林防火工作，并已请求上级给以应得的处分。
    这次火灾面积，没有超过三百亩。批评中说是四千亩，这是不确实的。（编者按：皖南黟县人民政府秘书甄清川同志也给本报写了信，指出汪奇峰同志的批评有两点与事实不符。第一，燃烧面积实际上并没有超过三百亩；第二，黟县县长和专署建设科长、公安处长，是在发生火灾的第二天赶到火场的，当时大火已被扑灭，他们在工区召开了工人大会，对救火有成绩的人员进行了表扬，对救火不力的人员进行了批评，同时布置了善后工作。并非像原批评所说，火起后县长、专署建设科长和公安处长等亲自率领干部、群众、武装人员四千多人赶往抢救，才把火扑灭。特此更正。）
