Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day, sent a telegram congratulating Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all commanders and fighters. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

Comrade Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

On the brilliant occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we, the literary and art workers of the whole country, extend our highest respect and warm congratulations to you with infinite excitement and enthusiasm!

Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after twenty-five years of arduous, outstanding, heroic, and striving battles, has developed into a powerful people's army. This people's army is not only the defender of the motherland but also a strong defender of peace in Asia and even the world. Today, we literary and art workers, like the people of the whole country, feel proud and honored to have this pillar of defending the motherland and world peace—the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Now, the American imperialist aggressors, after suffering heavy blows on the Korean front, are openly clamoring to expand the war of aggression, frantically carrying out inhuman germ warfare, openly and continuously infringing on our country's airspace, undermining and delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, abusing and killing prisoners of war, and illegally arming Japan and West Germany, attempting to achieve their conspiracy to dominate the world. However, this conspiracy, under the blows of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, has suffered a shameful defeat and will inevitably suffer a greater and more disastrous defeat. We, the literary and art workers of the whole country, on this glorious Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, warmly celebrate the growth and strength of the People's Liberation Army and pledge to fight to the end with you to win and defend world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent a telegram on the 29th congratulating the 25th Anniversary Sports Meeting of the "August 1st" Army Day. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

We are delighted to learn that the "August 1st" Army Day 25th Anniversary Sports Meeting has opened in Beijing. With unparalleled excitement and joy, we extend our warm congratulations to the meeting and pay our respects to the representatives attending the meeting!

The convening of the All-Army Sports Meeting marks the growth and strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This can not only accelerate the construction of a modern national defense force, effectively promote cultural learning throughout the army, develop the cultural life and sports activities of the troops, but also promote the rapid development of national sports. We wish the meeting victory and success!

    全国文联电朱总司令祝贺“八一”建军节
    并电贺人民解放军“八一”体育运动大会
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会在中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念前夕，致电祝贺中国人民解放军朱德总司令暨全体指挥员战斗员。贺电全文如下：中国人民解放军朱总司令暨全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    值此中国人民解放军建军节二十五周年纪念的光辉日子，我们全国文学艺术工作者以无限的兴奋与热情，向你们致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺！
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民解放军经过二十五年坚苦、卓绝、英勇、奋发的战斗，已经发展成为强大的人民军队。这样的人民的军队，不仅是祖国的保卫者，也是亚洲以至世界和平的坚强保卫者。今天，我们文学艺术工作者和全国人民一样，以有了这一保卫祖国与世界和平的柱石——中国人民解放军，而感到骄傲，并引为无上光荣。
    现在，美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜前线遭到了沉重的打击后，正在公开叫嚣扩大侵略战争，疯狂地进行灭绝人性的细菌战，公然不断地侵犯我国领空，并破坏和拖延朝鲜停战谈判、虐杀俘虏，非法武装日本和西德，企图达到独霸世界的阴谋。但是这种阴谋在以苏联为首的和平阵营的打击下，已经遭到可耻的失败，而且必然会遭到更大的惨败。我们全国文学艺术工作者，在这光荣的中国人民解放军的建军节日，热烈地庆祝人民解放军的成长和壮大，誓与你们共同为争取和保卫世界和平而战斗到底。
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会于二十九日电贺“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会。贺电全文如下：
    欣闻“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会在京开幕，我们以无比兴奋和愉快的心情，向大会致热烈的祝贺，并向参加大会的代表们致敬！
    全军体育运动大会的召开，标志着中国人民解放军的成长与壮大，这不仅可以加速现代化国防军的建设，有效推动全军文化学习、发展部队文化生活和体育运动，同时也将推进全国的体育运动迅速向前发展。祝大会的胜利与成功！
