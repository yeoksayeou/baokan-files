    Shanxi Daily Editorial Department's Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in Pictorial
    To the Editor: The criticisms made by comrades Yi Su, Peng Qishi, Ren Yi, and others in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 9th regarding the continuous errors in our newspaper's pictorial are entirely correct. The most significant error was in our May 12th pictorial, where we printed the photograph of the central government leaders reviewing the parade and the representatives of the Volunteer Army returning home watching the ceremony at Tiananmen Square during the "May 1st" holiday in reverse. This caused a very bad impact among our readers. As the readers stated, this was extremely disrespectful to our leaders and the Volunteer Army delegation. After this error occurred, many readers offered us strict criticisms. We immediately gathered relevant personnel for criticism and self-examination.
    In addition to thanking comrades Yi Su and others for their criticism and assistance, we will certainly treat pictorial work with a serious and responsible attitude in the future to ensure that errors do not occur again.

    山西日报编辑部关于画刊发生错误的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报七月九日“读者来信”栏中一粟、彭琦士、任一的等同志对我报画刊连续发生错误提出的批评，是完全正确的。其中最主要的错误是我报五月十二日的画刊，把“五一”节中央人民政府各首长在天安门检阅游行队伍和志愿军归国代表团代表观礼的照片登翻了，在读者中造成了很坏的影响。正如读者所说：这对我们的领袖与志愿军代表团是一个极大的不尊敬。发生这一错误后，不少读者对我们提出了严格的批评，我们当即召集有关人员进行了批评和检讨。
    我们除感谢一粟等同志的批评和帮助外，今后一定要以严肃负责的态度对待画刊工作，保证不再发生错误。
