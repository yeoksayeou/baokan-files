Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, July 10th: The fierce factional struggle within the Republican National Convention has erupted into disputes over delegate seats. According to newspaper reports, there is virtually no doubt that powerful forces are at work behind the scenes, and "deals" that determine the outcome of the convention's struggle are being conducted in secret.

The "New York Times" commented on July 7th on the role that convention delegates can actually play in the convention's decisions, saying: "Fewer than a dozen party leaders are quietly plotting against each other, and the really important things are in their hands. Hundreds of delegates wear armbands, indicating their importance, and they carry flags, rushing around, happily believing that they are the ones playing a role. But they have no part in making decisions, and are often kept in the dark."

This behind-the-scenes infighting is being actively participated in by representatives of the American big monopoly capital. On July 6th, Aldrich, the chairman of the New York Chase Bank, arrived in Chicago. He is a leading figure in the Rockefeller empire. According to a report in the "Chicago Tribune" on July 7th, Aldrich, who lives in a private residence far from the convention hall, is using New York Governor Dewey to exert enormous pressure on the delegates on behalf of the Rockefeller Group, urging them to vote for Eisenhower. The "Chicago Tribune" reported that Aldrich and Chase Bank gave the Dewey Group a list of important stockbrokers who could influence the delegates' votes, as well as some secret information about stock transactions. The Dewey Group has used this information to buy or exert pressure on local stockbrokers through Chase Bank's branches in various electoral districts. These people in turn assured Chase Bank that they would put pressure on the convention delegates to support Eisenhower. Some delegates have already been strongly influenced.

The activities of other Wall Street representatives are even more public than those of Aldrich. Shortly before the opening of the Chicago convention, George Sloan, a director of General Motors Corporation, controlled by the DuPont-Morgan consortium, and many other companies controlled by Morgan, and chairman of the US Council of the International Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that he had written to the representatives of the Southern states, urging them to support Eisenhower.

It is very likely that other important figures who support Eisenhower will use all the methods they can to get Eisenhower elected as a candidate. Among these figures are representatives of the most powerful capitalist groups in the United States - the Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, Mellon, and Ford groups. These include Aldrich, George Sloan, General Motors CEO Alfred Sloan, General Motors director, manager of Morgan-controlled "Continental Can Company" General Clay, a senior official of Rockefeller-controlled California Mobil Oil Company, CEO of ARAMCO Henry Collier, financier John Hay Whitney, Henry Ford, "Equitable Life Insurance Company" CEO and Chase Bank director Thomas Parkinson, Mellon-controlled "Gulf Oil Corporation" CEO, "Mellon National Bank and Trust Company" director Drake.

It is clear from the news reports that Eisenhower is the darling of the major financial capital groups in the East, while those who support Taft are mainly financial capital groups concentrated in Chicago and Cleveland, directors of Midwestern industrial companies outside the sphere of influence of Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont, and "independent" oil companies that are not under Rockefeller's control and compete with Mobil Oil in the domestic market.

Those who support Taft include: Buhner, a director of "Chrysler Corporation," Timken, chairman of "Timken" roller ball company (in Ohio), Edison, chairman of "Thomas Edison Company" (in New Jersey) and former Governor of New Jersey, Harris, former chairman of the Chicago financial company "Harris Trust Company," Morse, chairman of "Fairbanks-Morse Company," a major manufacturer of internal combustion engines and electric motors in Chicago, Queeny, chairman of "Monsanto Chemical Company," Pierson, chairman of "Inland Steel Company" (in Chicago), Hamilton, the agent of a powerful "independent" new oil and shipbuilding group (in Philadelphia), General Wood, chairman of the large trading company "Sears, Roebuck and Company" (headquartered in Chicago), and McCormick, the publisher of the "Chicago Tribune."

Some people on Wall Street also support Taft. Among the members of the "Citizens Committee for Taft" is Strauss, a former partner of the Wall Street giant "Kuhn, Loeb & Co." and now a financial advisor to the Rockefeller Group. Although the Rockefeller family mainly supports Eisenhower, they also make a small "investment" in Taft's camp.

American progressives point out that in the fierce factional struggle for the Republican presidential nomination, no matter who wins, the outcome will not benefit the American people or the general members of the Republican Party. They emphasize that neither Taft nor Eisenhower can represent the needs and aspirations of the people who yearn for peace, democratic rights, and economic stability.

    美国大垄断资本家代表人物
    操纵共和党两派竞选的情况
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社芝加哥九日讯：共和党全国代表大会里激烈的宗派斗争，爆发成为争夺代表席位的争执。根据报纸的报道，简直不容怀疑：在幕后有强有力的势力在起作用，决定大会斗争结果的“买卖”正在秘密地进行。
    “纽约时报”七月七日评论大会代表对大会的实际决定所能起的作用说：“为数不到一打的政党领袖不声不响地在勾心斗角，真正重要的事情是操在他们手里的。几百个代表佩着臂章，表示他们地位的重要，他们举着旗子，匆匆忙忙跑来跑去，兴高采烈地满以为起作用的是他们这些人。但是运筹决策是没有他们的份的，而且往往被蒙在鼓里不知道呢。”
    这种幕后的暗中倾轧，是有美国大垄断资本的代表人物积极参加的。七月六日，纽约大通银行的董事长阿德利治到了芝加哥。他是洛克菲勒帝国的首脑人物。据七月七日“芝加哥论坛报”报道：住在离代表大会会堂很远的私人住宅中的阿德利治，通过纽约州州长杜威，代表洛克菲勒集团对代表们施以巨大压力，要他们投艾森豪威尔的票。“芝加哥论坛报”的消息说：阿德利治和大通银行交给了杜威集团一批力能左右代表投票的重要股票商的名单以及若干有关股票交易的秘密情报。杜威集团已利用这些情报通过大通银行在各选区的分行对当地的股票商进行收买或行使压力。这些人就向大通银行保证再对大会代表施以压力，要他们赞成艾森豪威尔。有些代表已受到了强烈的影响。
    其他华尔街代表的活动甚至比阿德利治更加公开。在芝加哥代表大会开幕前不久，为杜邦—摩根财团控制的通用汽车公司以及摩根控制的其他许多公司的董事、美国国际商会理事会主席、乔治·斯隆向报界说，他已写信给南部各州的代表，要他们支持艾森豪威尔。
    很可能，另外一些支持艾森豪威尔的重要人物会使用他们能够使用的一切方法来使艾森豪威尔当选为候选人。这些人物中间有美国最有势力的资本家集团——摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦、梅隆和福特等集团——的代表。其中有阿德利治、乔治·斯隆，通用汽车公司总经理阿佛伦德·斯隆，通用汽车公司董事、摩根控制的“大陆罐头公司”的经理克莱将军，洛克菲勒控制的加利福尼亚美孚油公司的高级负责人、阿（拉伯）—美（国）石油公司总经理亨利·柯立尔，金融家约翰·海伊·惠特尼，亨利·福特，“公平人寿保险公司”的总经理兼大通银行董事汤马斯·巴金逊，梅隆控制的“海湾石油公司”总经理、“梅隆国民银行与信托公司”董事德拉克。
    从报上的消息中可以看得很清楚，艾森豪威尔是东部各大金融资本集团的宠儿，而支持塔夫脱的主要是集中在芝加哥和克利夫兰的金融资本集团，在摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆和杜邦的势力范围以外的中西部产业公司的董事，以及不在洛克菲勒的控制下而且与美孚油公司竞争国内市场的各“独立”的石油公司。
    支持塔夫脱的人计有：“克莱斯勒公司”董事布新森，“第姆肯”滚珠公司（在俄亥俄）的董事长第姆肯，“托玛斯·爱迪逊公司”（在新泽西）的董事长、前新泽西州州长爱迪逊，前芝加哥金融公司“哈里斯信托公司”的董事长哈里斯，“费尔班·莫尔斯公司”董事长、芝加哥的内燃机、电动机的大制造商莫尔斯，“孟山都化学公司”的董事长奎奈，“内陆钢铁公司”（在芝加哥）董事长皮尔森，有势力的“独立”的新石油与造船业集团（在费城）的代理人哈米尔顿，大贸易公司“西尔斯·罗伯克公司”（总公司设在芝加哥）的董事长伍德将军，“芝加哥论坛报”发行人麦考米克。
    华尔街也有一部分人支持塔夫脱。“拥护塔夫脱公民委员会”的委员中就有华尔街大公司“库恩·洛伯公司”的前合伙人、现在洛克菲勒集团财政顾问的斯特劳士。洛克菲勒家族虽然以主要的力量支持艾森豪威尔，但是在塔夫脱的阵营里也作一点“投资”。
    美国的进步人士指出：在共和党提名总统候选人的激烈的派系斗争上，不管是谁胜利，结果对于美国人民或共和党的一般党员都不会有好处。他们强调指出：因为无论是塔夫脱或者艾森豪威尔，都丝毫不能代表渴望和平、民主权利与经济稳定的人民的需要与愿望。
