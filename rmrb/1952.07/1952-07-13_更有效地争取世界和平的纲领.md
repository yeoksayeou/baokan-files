    A Program for More Effectively Striving for World Peace
    Feng BinFu, Member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

    The special meeting of the World Peace Council held in Berlin concluded on the 6th of this month. After extensive and enthusiastic discussions, the meeting adopted four important resolutions on the pressing issues of safeguarding world peace and strengthening the peace movement: "Resolution on the Immediate Cessation of the Korean War," "Resolution on Opposing the Remilitarization of Japan and Fighting for a Democratic Japan," "Appeal to the Governments of the Four Powers and the People of the World on the German Question," and "Declaration on Convening the World People's Peace Congress." These resolutions and declarations strongly reflect the will of the people of the world to yearn for peace and correctly point out the path to safeguarding world peace. This is a great call for justice and fairness, and a clear program for striving for world peace more powerfully and effectively.

    Recently, the international situation has remained tense and deteriorated due to the frantic creation of a war crisis by the imperialist war bloc headed by the United States. The Korean War continues; although the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, their success or failure hangs by a thread due to the United States' unreasonable obstruction and interference. At the same time, American imperialists are stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan. However, "the devil rises one foot, the Dao rises ten." The frantic behavior of imperialism has made more and more people demand peace more resolutely, and the forces of the world peace front have become more consolidated and strengthened. All of this is clearly manifested in the enthusiastic and firm speeches of representatives from various countries at this Berlin meeting; manifested in the ability of representatives from various countries and different fields to quickly reach a consensus; and more specifically manifested in the solemn resolutions made by the meeting on the international situation. The achievements of the Berlin meeting show that the growing world peace movement has moved a step further, and that no force can stop the advance of the forces of peace.

    The immediate cessation of the Korean War is indeed the most urgent task in the current struggle for peace. This call from the Berlin meeting fully meets the demands of the people of the world, and is sincerely supported by our Chinese people. We have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and have been striving for it. The victory of the Chinese and Korean people in their heroic resistance to American aggression once forced the American aggressors to sit down and negotiate. However, in order to maintain international tensions and facilitate its military expansion and war preparations, and even expand the war, the American aggressors have exhausted all means of delaying and obstructing the negotiations for a year, so that the negotiations have lasted for more than a year without reaching a complete agreement. The course of the negotiations over the past year has proved the sincerity and sincerity of the Chinese and Korean sides in striving for an armistice in Korea. We have patiently negotiated, repeatedly reasoned, insisted on negotiations, and insisted on solving problems on a fair and reasonable basis, and finally eliminated the US's unreasonable excuses one by one, so that most of the problems have been resolved in the negotiations. Now the only remaining issue is the repatriation of prisoners of war. According to historical practice and the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, this issue should not have been a problem. However, the US side has unreasonably insisted on so-called "voluntary repatriation," attempting to forcibly detain our prisoners of war and send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to serve as cannon fodder, causing the negotiations to be delayed until now. At the same time, the US has repeatedly and stubbornly exercised so-called "military pressure," attempting to force us to accept its unreasonable demands. The United States' inhuman germ warfare in Korea, and recently its indiscriminate bombing of peaceful facilities on the Yalu River in the rear of Korea, are new provocations to achieve this arrogant goal. However, the intimidation and provocation tactics of the American aggressors have completely failed in the face of the invincible power of the Chinese and Korean people. As a result, the US representative has again expressed his willingness to negotiate in a consultative manner, and the Korean armistice negotiations entered an administrative meeting on July 4. Naturally, we, who have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, never give up any opportunity for consultation; but on the other hand, the Chinese and Korean people will never relax their vigilance against the American aggressors in the slightest. Whether the Korean armistice negotiations can reach an agreement depends entirely on the US side.

    In addition to aggression against Korea, American imperialism has taken sinful steps to accelerate the revival of fascist militarism and prepare for new wars in Europe and the Far East. In Europe, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany signed the "General Treaty" in Bonn on May 26, and the governments of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany signed the "European Defense Community" treaty in Paris on May 27. These are two twin sinful war treaties. Through the former, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany concluded an "open military alliance"; through the latter, the United States incorporated the West German invading army headed by Nazi generals into the "European Army" and linked it to the invading army of the North Atlantic Group. In the Far East, after the separate war treaties and agreements imposed on Japan by Washington were declared "effective," the United States is turning Japan into a colony and accelerating the arming of Japan to make it the core of the Pacific aggression group being manufactured. This sinful measure of the American aggressors to create war and endanger peace has aroused increasingly strong resistance in Asia and Europe at the same time. In Japan, more and more people are uniting under the banner of the national liberation democratic united front to fight against American enslavement and the Yoshida traitorous government; the vigorous strike movement of Japanese workers is developing to an unprecedented climax. The people of Asian countries fully sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Japanese people. The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference has completed its preparations, and this peace conference will be held in September, and it has been decided to list "opposing the re-militarization of Japan and opposing the use of Japan as a base of aggression to eliminate the serious threat to peace in Asia and the Pacific region" as the main topic. In Western Europe, the struggle of the people of various countries against American enslavement is unfolding fiercely. Following Eisenhower, Ridgway, the commander-in-chief of the European invading army, went there, and the cry of "Ridgway get out" rang out there; more than 80% of the West German people opposed re-militarization; the bankruptcy of the French government's accusation that the French Communist leader Duclos was involved in a conspiracy shows the strength of the French people.

    The resolutions of the Berlin meeting on the Korean, German, and Japanese issues will surely encourage the people of Europe and Asia to fight more heroically. The Berlin meeting decided to hold the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5 this year, which will unite all those who desire peace and will surely enable the world peace movement to achieve a broader and more powerful development.

    更有效地争取世界和平的纲领
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会委员  冯宾符
    在柏林举行的世界和平理事会特别会议，已于本月六日闭幕。经过广泛而热烈的讨论，会议就当前保卫世界和平和加强和平运动的迫切问题，通过了四项重要的决议，即：“关于立即停止朝鲜战争的决议”，“关于反对日本重新军国主义化、为民主的日本而斗争的决议”，“关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书”，以及“关于召开世界人民和平大会的宣言”。这些决议和宣言，强烈地反映了全世界人民渴望和平的意志，正确地指出了保卫世界和平的道路。这是正义和公理的伟大号召，这是更有力地更有效地争取世界和平的明确纲领。
    最近以来，由于以美国为首的帝国主义战争集团疯狂地制造着战争危机，国际局势仍在紧张和恶化中。朝鲜战争依然继续着；朝鲜停战谈判虽在进行，但由于美国的无理阻挠和作梗，谈判的成败系于一发；与此同时，美国帝国主义者正加紧武装着西德和日本。可是“魔高一尺，道高一丈”。帝国主义的疯狂行为，使得广大人民愈来愈多地和愈坚决地要求保卫和平，世界和平阵线的力量更加巩固和壮大了。这一切，清楚地表现于这次柏林会议中各国代表热烈而坚决的发言；表现于来自各国不同方面的各国代表意见能够迅速得到一致，更具体的表现于会议所作出的关于国际形势的严正决议。柏林会议的成就，说明了日益壮大的世界和平运动更向前推进了一步，说明了决没有什么力量能够阻挡和平力量的前进。
    立即停止朝鲜战争，确是当前争取和平的最迫切的任务。柏林会议的这个号召，完全符合全世界人民的要求，更为我们中国人民所衷心拥护。我们一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并一直为之奋斗。中朝人民英勇反抗美国侵略的胜利，曾经迫使美国侵略者不得不坐下来谈判。可是美国侵略者为了保持国际紧张局势，以便利其扩军备战乃至扩大战争，在一年来谈判中耍尽了拖延和阻挠的手法，以致谈判已逾一年，至今尚未获致完全协议。一年来谈判的经过，证明了中朝方面真心诚意为朝鲜停战而努力的事实。我们耐心协商，反复说理，坚持谈判，坚持在公平合理的基础上解决问题，终于一一解除了美方的无理藉口，使大部分问题在谈判中获得了解决。现在剩下来的问题只有一个战俘遣返问题。按照历史惯例和日内瓦战俘公约的规定，这个问题本来也是不成问题的。但美国方面，竟一再无理坚持所谓“自愿遣返”，妄图强迫扣留我方的战俘，送给蒋李匪帮去充当炮灰，致使谈判拖延至今。与此同时，美方又一再蛮横行使所谓“军事压力”，妄图迫使我们接受其蛮横无理的要求。美国在朝鲜进行灭绝人性的细菌战，最近又滥炸朝鲜后方鸭绿江边的和平设备，便是为了达到这个狂妄目的的新挑衅。但是，美国侵略者这种恫吓、挑衅的伎俩在不可屈服的中朝人民力量面前完全破产了。因之美国代表又表示愿意用协商的态度进行谈判，朝鲜停战谈判已于七月四日起进入了行政性会议。自然，一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题的我们，从不放弃任何一个协商的机会；但是另一方面，中朝人民也决不会丝毫放松对于美国侵略者的警惕。朝鲜停战谈判能否达成协议，责任完全在于美方了。
    在侵略朝鲜之外，美国帝国主义又采取罪恶的步骤，在欧洲和远东加紧复活法西斯军国主义与准备新战争。在欧洲，美、英、法和西德政府于五月二十六日在波恩签订了“一般性条约”，法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和西德政府于五月二十七日在巴黎签订了“欧洲防务集团”条约。这是两个孪生的罪恶的战争条约。通过了前者，美英法和西德政府缔结了“公开的军事联盟”；通过了后者，美国把以纳粹将领为首的西德侵略军并入“欧洲军”而和北大西洋集团侵略军联系起来。在远东，华盛顿强加于日本的单独战争条约和协定被宣布“生效”以后，美国正在把日本变为殖民地，并加紧武装日本，使之成为制造中的太平洋侵略集团的核心。美国侵略者这种制造战争、危害和平的罪恶措施，在亚洲和欧洲同时引起了愈来愈强烈的反抗。在日本，愈来愈多的人民正在民族解放民主统一战线的旗帜下团结起来，为反抗美国奴役和吉田卖国政府而斗争；日本工人蓬勃的罢工运动，正在发展到空前的高潮。亚洲各国人民完全同情和支持日本人民的正义斗争。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议已完成了准备的工作，这个和平会议即将于九月间召开，并已决定把“反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁”列为主要的议题。在西欧，各国人民反对美国奴役的斗争正在激烈展开中。继艾森豪威尔任欧洲侵略军总司令的李奇微走到那里，那里就响起“李奇微滚出去”的呼声；西德人民有百分之八十以上反对重新军国主义化；法国比内政府诬陷法共领袖杜克洛阴谋的破产，说明了法国人民力量的强大。
    柏林会议关于朝鲜、德国和日本问题的决议，必将鼓舞欧、亚两洲人民更加英勇地进行斗争。柏林会议决定于今年十二月五日在维也纳举行世界人民保卫和平大会，将团结一切凡是希望和平的人们，必将使世界和平运动得到更广阔有力的发展。
