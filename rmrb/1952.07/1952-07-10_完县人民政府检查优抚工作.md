Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: We have conducted an inspection based on the criticism of the preferential treatment work in Wan County made by comrades Yan Geng and Li Lin, which was published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 14th. Regarding the issue of relief grain received by the family of Ma Shuzhen from Shenbei Village: After Ma Shuzhen joined the army, her family still had her brother and mother. Her brother had a job with a salary. Her mother lived with her brother. In addition, Ma Shuzhen's family had six mu of land, with a yield of eight dan and five dou in 1951. Even if her mother lived at home, her life would not be a problem. Therefore, Ma Shuzhen's family did not need to receive relief grain. Regarding the issue of compensation for the family of martyr Zhao Yimin: Because the temporary notification did not specify the rank (if the rank was specified, it could be handled in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations), 800 jin of millet were temporarily issued, and it was stated that a final decision would be made after the official notification arrived. When the official notification arrived, the rank was still not specified, only "Issue 1000 jin of millet" was written on the back. Therefore, we had to wait for the rank certificate to make a decision. The criticism of comrades Yan Geng and Li Lin is helpful to our work. Currently, we are launching an inspection movement on preferential treatment work throughout the county and are determined to overcome shortcomings in our work. It is very wrong that individual cadres have a bad attitude towards revolutionary soldiers. In addition to holding meetings to examine and criticize this, we guarantee that it will be thoroughly corrected in the future.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    完县人民政府检查优抚工作
    编辑同志：五月十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了严更、李林二同志对完县优抚工作的批评，我们已经根据这个批评作了检查。关于神北村马淑珍家属领救济粮的问题：马淑珍参军以后，家中还有她哥哥和母亲。她哥哥有工作，是薪金制待遇，她母亲就和她哥哥在一起生活。另外，马淑珍家有土地六亩，一九五一年的产量是八石五斗，即使她母亲在家过活，生活也是不成问题的。所以，马淑珍家不必再领取救济粮。关于烈士赵一民家属的抚恤问题：因为临时通知书上没有写明级别（如写明级别，就可按优抚条例办理），所以暂先发了八百斤小米，并曾说明等正式通知书来了，再作最后决定。正式通知书来了，仍然没有写明级别，只在背面上批着“发小米一千斤”。于是，我们便只好等待级别证明书来了再作决定。严更、李林二同志的批评，对我们的工作是有帮助的。现在，我们正在全县开展一个优抚工作的检查运动，并决心克服工作中的缺点。个别干部对待革命军人的态度不好，是非常错误的，我们除开会检查批评外，并保证今后彻底纠正。
