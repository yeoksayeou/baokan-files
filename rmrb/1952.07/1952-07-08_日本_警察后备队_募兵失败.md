Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: TASS reports: According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese people rightly believe that the "Police Reserve Force" is a mercenary army of the United States. The unpopularity of the "Police Reserve Force" among the Japanese people can be seen from the recent failure of the force to recruit soldiers. Although the authorities have tried every means to recruit, and there is a large number of unemployed people in Japan, not many Japanese are willing to join this American mercenary army. For example, in Gifu Prefecture, the original plan was to recruit 1,700 people, but only 140 people applied in total. In the Maruyama area of ​​Yamagata Prefecture, the number of applicants decreased by two-thirds compared with 1950. In Sakata, the number of applicants was only one-tenth of the original target.

    日本“警察后备队”募兵失败
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社东京四日讯：据日本报纸的消息，日本人民正确地认为“警察后备队”是美国的雇佣军。“警察后备队”在日本人民中间不受欢迎的情形，从不久前该队募兵失败的事实中可以看出来。虽然当局千方百计地进行募集，而且日本存在大批失业的现象，可是愿意参加这支美国雇佣军的日本人并不多。例如，在岐阜县原拟招募一千七百人，结果报名的总共才一百四十人。在山形县丸山（译音）地区报名的人数比一九五○年减少三分之二。在酒田，报名的人数仅及原定人数的十分之一。
