    Chen Jinbao and others, cadres from the Public Security Bureau of Gucheng County, Hebei Province,
    Should Not Interfere with Freedom of Marriage and Violate Human Rights
    On July 1st, reader Su Jinping (female) visited the reader's letters group of this newspaper, accusing Chen Jinbao and others, cadres from the Public Security Bureau of Gucheng County, Hebei Province, of illegal acts of interfering with her freedom of marriage and violating her human rights. A summary of Su Jinping's conversation is published as follows:
    My name is Su Jinping, I am eighteen years old, and I live in Dongxue Village, District Three, Gucheng County, Hebei Province. My lover, Su Peiyuan, currently works at the People's Court in the Central District of Beijing. We have known each other since childhood, have a good relationship, and wish to become husband and wife. In June of this year, he took leave to go home to resolve the marriage issue. My father, Su Peixin, and my elder brother, Su Jindong, have feudal ideas and do not allow me to have autonomy in marriage. I went to the village cadres Su Yuchao, Su Shuzhi, Su Changxiang, etc., asking them to transfer my household registration to Beijing so that my marriage problem could be solved. The village cadres did not express any opinions at the time and went to discuss it with Chen Jinbao, a cadre of the County Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, Chen Jinbao openly interfered with my freedom of marriage, saying that we "cannot marry because we have the same surname" and "cannot marry without a letter of introduction from an organization," and illegally withheld my household registration transfer certificate. Under these circumstances, my lover returned to Beijing. Fearing that my father and my brother would further restrict me, I came to Beijing to find my lover in late June. The village cadres Su Yuchao and others, with Chen Jinbao's connivance, demanded my return from my mother and detained my lover's elder brother, Su Peisheng, overnight, and forced my lover's elder sister, Su Peiying, to bring me back from Beijing within ten days. Now Su Peiying has been forced to come to Beijing and does not dare to go home.
    I solemnly declare to the People's Daily: Although my lover and I are from the same village and have the same surname, we do not violate any of the clauses prohibiting marriage stipulated in the Marriage Law. Therefore, my father, my brother, and my village cadres saying that this independent and voluntary union of ours "ruins ancestral customs and virtues" is completely unreasonable. Chen Jinbao, a cadre of the County Public Security Bureau, interfered with my freedom of marriage, restricted my freedom of movement, condoned and supported the village cadres in detaining my lover's elder brother, and forced my lover's elder sister to come to Beijing to find me. These are serious acts of illegal dereliction of duty. I ask the People's Daily to help me solve this problem. I request that relevant authorities give Chen Jinbao and others, who have committed illegal dereliction of duty and violated human rights, the necessary punishment, and demand compensation for Su Peiying's travel expenses incurred when she was forced to come to Beijing to find me.

    Editor's Note: The situation described by Su Jinping to this newspaper should attract the attention of the Party and government leading organs of Gucheng County.
    Su Jinping has struggled against feudal ideas in her family in order to win her freedom of marriage. This action should be encouraged and supported by the People's Government. Chen Jinbao, a cadre of the Public Security Bureau of Gucheng County, violated the Marriage Law and obstructed Su Jinping's actions to win her freedom of marriage, and should be punished appropriately. The village cadres of Dongxue Village, Gucheng County, who interfered with Su Jinping's marriage, should be criticized. The Party and government leading organs of Gucheng County should strengthen the publicity and education of the Marriage Law for cadres and the masses, overcome feudal residual ideas, make every cadre a backbone in implementing the Marriage Law, and make every member of the masses understand and implement the Marriage Law.

### 河北故城县公安局干部陈锦宝等  不应干涉婚姻自由侵犯人权

    河北故城县公安局干部陈锦宝等
    不应干涉婚姻自由侵犯人权
    七月一日，读者苏金平（女）访问本报读者来信组，控诉河北省故城县公安局干部陈锦宝等干涉她的婚姻自由和侵犯她的人权的非法行为。现将苏金平的谈话摘要发表如下：
    我叫苏金平，今年十八岁，家住河北省故城县三区董学村。我的爱人苏佩元，现在北京中城区人民法院工作。我俩从小就认识，双方感情很好，愿成为夫妻。今年六月间，他请假回家，解决婚姻问题。我父亲苏佩信、我哥哥苏金栋思想封建，不许我婚姻自主。我便去找村干部苏玉超、苏树枝、苏长相等，要求他们把我的户口迁移到北京，以便解决我的婚姻问题。村干部当时并没有表示什么意见，就去和县公安局干部陈锦宝商量。不料陈锦宝竟公开干涉我的婚姻自由，说我们“同姓不能结婚”，“没有机关介绍信不能结婚”，并非法扣留我的户口迁移证。在这种情况下，我爱人就回北京了。我怕我父亲和我哥哥进一步限制我，就在六月下旬，来北京找我爱人。村干部苏玉超等发觉我到了北京，竟在陈锦宝的纵容下，向我母亲要人，还把我爱人的哥哥苏佩生扣了一夜，并强逼我爱人的姐姐苏佩英在十天以内把我从北京带回。现在苏佩英已经被迫来到北京，并且不敢回家了。
    我向人民日报负责声明：我和我爱人虽然是同村同姓，但与婚姻法规定禁止结婚的条款，丝毫没有抵触。因此，我父亲、我哥哥和我村村干部说我们这种自主自愿的结合“败坏了祖风祖德”，是毫无道理的。县公安局干部陈锦宝干涉我的婚姻自由，限制我的迁徙自由，纵容和支持村干部扣押我爱人的哥哥，强逼我爱人的姐姐到北京来找我，是严重的违法失职的行为。我要求人民日报帮助我解决这个问题，我要求有关机关给违法失职、侵犯人权的陈锦宝等以必要的处分，并要求赔偿苏佩英被逼来北京找我时的路费损失。
    编者按：苏金平来本报所谈的情况，应该引起故城县党政领导机关的重视。
    苏金平为了争取自己的婚姻自由，对家庭中的封建思想进行了斗争，这种行动应当受到人民政府的鼓励和支持。故城县公安局干部陈锦宝违犯婚姻法，阻挠苏金平争取婚姻自由的行动，应该受到适当处分。故城县董学村干涉苏金平婚姻问题的村干部，应该受到批评。故城县党政领导机关应该对干部和群众加强婚姻法的宣传教育，克服封建残余思想，使每个干部都成为执行婚姻法的骨干，使每个群众都了解并执行婚姻法。
