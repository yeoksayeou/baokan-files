    North China Level Organ, Group and School Celebration of "July 1st" Conference
    Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Chairman Mao, Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
    More than 4,000 people from Party, government, military, civilian, and academic organs, groups, and schools at the North China level held a conference to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the founding of our Party! Celebrating the great victory of our Party's heroic struggle over the past 31 years!
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Party in North China has victoriously carried out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements of great significance. At the same time, it has also achieved greater achievements than ever before in industrial production, agricultural production, and other economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction. We firmly believe that these achievements will be of great significance to the future construction of North China.
    Now that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have come to a victorious conclusion, the task of large-scale economic construction has been placed before the entire Party in North China and has become the central task for a long period to come. In order to welcome and victoriously undertake this great historical task, the Party in North China is determined to further consolidate the Party ranks and strengthen Party building on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and to strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and learn how to lead economic construction. We believe that under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the active efforts of all the people and all the cadres, we have full confidence in completing all the tasks given to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and striving to build our great motherland!

    毛主席中国共产党中央委员会：
    华北一级党、政、军、民、学各机关、团体、学校四千余人举行大会，庆祝我党建党的三十一周年！庆祝我党三十一年来英勇奋斗的伟大胜利！
    华北的党在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，胜利地进行了具有伟大意义的“三反”运动和“五反”运动，与此同时，在工业生产、农业生产以及其他经济建设、国防建设和文化建设方面，也都获得了较之以往更大的成绩。我们深信，这些成绩对于华北今后的建设是有极大作用的。
    现在，“三反”、“五反”运动已经胜利结束，大规模的经济建设任务已经摆在华北全党的面前，成为今后长时期的中心任务。为迎接并胜利地担负起这一伟大的历史任务，华北的党决在“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利基础上，进一步整顿党的队伍，加强党的建设，努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，学好经济建设的领导工作。我们相信：在毛主席和党中央的直接领导下，在全体人民和全体干部的积极努力下，我们完全有信心完成毛主席和党中央给予我们的一切任务，为建设我们的伟大祖国而奋斗！
