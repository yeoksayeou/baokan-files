    Economic Work Departments Should Establish and Improve Working Systems
    Editor: After the great "Three-Anti" Movement, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people have received profound class education. The new morality and new atmosphere of honesty in performing official duties and hard work and simplicity are growing, which is a very valuable phenomenon. In order to consolidate the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement, I hope that all units will summarize the experiences and lessons of the "Three-Anti" Movement and establish and improve various necessary economic work systems.
    In the past, our company, due to incomplete systems, created opportunities for embezzlers to exploit loopholes, causing undue losses to state property. Now, based on our experience in the "Three-Anti" Movement, we have established a series of specific systems in financial accounting work, such as detailed rules for auditing and inspecting financial expenditures, management measures for packaging waste products, and property management measures. These systems have plugged the loopholes that may occur in the work, making the work gradually on the right track. In order to ensure the implementation of these systems, we have also established a regular inspection system. In this way, we feel that our work is well-organized and all complicated procedures are clear and traceable. I suggest that other economic enterprises and institutions promptly establish necessary scientific working systems according to their actual conditions and work needs.

    经济工作部门要建立和健全工作制度
    编辑同志：经过伟大的“三反”运动，各级干部和广大人民，都受到了深刻的阶级教育。廉洁奉公和坚苦朴实的新道德、新风气正在生长，这是十分可贵的现象。为了巩固“三反”运动的伟大成果，我希望各单位总结“三反”运动的经验教训，并建立和健全各种必要的经济工作制度。
    过去，我们公司因为制度不健全，给贪污分子造成钻空子的机会，使国家财产遭受了不应有的损失。现在我们已经根据“三反”运动中的体验，在财务会计工作方面，建立了财务开支审核检查实施细则、包装废品的管理办法、财产管理办法等一系列的具体制度。这些制度堵塞了工作上可能发生的漏洞，使工作逐步走上了轨道。为了保证这些制度的执行，我们还建立了经常的检查制度。这样，我们工作起来就感觉有条不紊，一切繁杂的手续都清晰可查。我建议其他经济企业单位，根据实际情况和工作需要，迅速建立必要的科学的工作制度。
