    Shanghai Jiefang Daily's promotion of Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience is primarily characterized by its departure from the approach of other newspapers that simply report one or two pieces of high-yield experience and consider the matter closed. Instead, it adopts a more guided and organized series of promotions.

    Shanghai Jiefang Daily began publishing Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience on December 20th of last year. At that time, the newspaper also published a short commentary entitled "Seriously Investigate, Summarize, and Promote Farmers' High-Yield Experience." On January 12th of this year, the newspaper published the "Investigation Report on Chen Yongkang's High-Yield Rice Experience" by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, providing a more systematic and complete introduction to Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience. Subsequently, Jiefang Daily continued to conduct a series of promotions.

    Many farmers in various regions, even those in Songjiang County, where Chen Yongkang is located, expressed skepticism towards Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience. In response to this situation, Jiefang Daily published a report on March 18th on Songjiang County's promotion of Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience through symposiums and exhibitions. At the symposium, Chen Yongkang himself introduced his farming methods. This not only changed many people's conservative thinking and backward farming methods but also eliminated concerns about increased burdens from producing more grain. The news "Farmers from Various Regions Visited Chen Yongkang's Sowing in Person," published by the newspaper on May 8th, further overcame their "production ceiling" mentality through the "periodic visits" of over 750 farmers from Songjiang, Wuxi, and Longhua District in the Shanghai suburbs, powerfully promoting Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience.

    Promoting advanced experience must be combined with the specific conditions of each region. Jiefang Daily published reports on March 18th and April 18th, respectively, on how Linpu District in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, and the Chuxilin Mutual Aid Group in Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu, flexibly promoted Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience and learned from each other's strengths to compensate for their weaknesses based on local conditions. In a short commentary entitled "Vigorously Promote Typical High-Yield Experiences" (see the newspaper on March 18th), the newspaper summarized and promoted the experience of Xiaoshan County in flexibly promoting high-yield experience, pointing out that it is necessary to use typical examples to drive the general, gradually promoting, and avoiding rigidly applying experience. This approach of summarizing the experience of "from the masses, to the masses" and then promoting it to the masses not only demonstrates that the newspaper has a certain degree of planning and purpose in promoting Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience but also has an important educational effect on guiding the masses of farmers on how to correctly learn from high-yield experience.

    Jiefang Daily's promotion of Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience is not without its shortcomings. The vast area of East China is mainly engaged in rice cultivation, but it only reported on the study and promotion of Chen Yongkang's high-yield rice experience in a very small number of areas, such as Songjiang, Xiaoshan, Wuxi, and the suburban areas of Shanghai. As for whether many other areas have studied and promoted this high-yield experience, and what difficulties they have encountered in the promotion, the newspaper has not reported on this further. This shows that Jiefang Daily still lacks the use of criticism and inspection methods to urge various regions to promote and adhere to this effective high-yield experience in a focused manner. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen and improve this promotion in the future.

### 上海解放日报关于推广陈永康丰产经验的宣传

    上海解放日报关于推广陈永康丰产经验的宣传
    上海解放日报推广陈永康丰产经验的宣传，最主要的特点，就是它不像其他一些报纸只报道一、二篇丰产经验就算完事，而是比较有领导有组织地采取了一系列的宣传。
    上海解放日报开始刊登陈永康丰产经验是在去年十二月二十日。当时，该报并以“认真调查、总结和推广农民的丰产经验”为题发表了短论。到今年一月十二日该报又发表了华东军政委员会农林部关于“陈永康水稻丰产经验考察报告”，对陈永康丰产经验作了比较系统而完整的介绍。随后，解放日报继续作了一系列的宣传。
    各地很多农民，甚至连陈永康所在县——松江县的农民，对陈永康丰产经验都表示怀疑态度。根据这一情况，解放日报在三月十八日发表了松江县通过座谈会、展览会等方式推广陈永康丰产经验的报道。在座谈会上并由陈永康本人介绍了他的耕作方法。这样不仅改变了很多人的保守思想和落后的耕作方法，而且消除了怕多打粮食多负担的顾虑。该报五月八日刊登的“各地农民实地参观陈永康播种”的消息，更通过苏南松江、无锡以及上海市郊龙华区等地农民七百五十余人的“分期参观”，克服了他们的“生产到顶”的思想，有力地推广了陈永康丰产经验。
    推广先进经验必须与各地具体情况相结合。解放日报在三月十八日、四月十八日曾先后发表了浙江萧山县临浦区、苏南嘉定县褚西林互助组，如何根据当地条件灵活推广陈永康丰产经验和取长补短的报道。该报在题为“大力推广丰产典型经验”（见三月十八日该报）的短论中，总结和推广了萧山县这个灵活推广丰产经验的经验，指出必须以典型推动一般，逐步推广，不要生硬地搬运经验。这个把“从群众中来，到群众中去”的经验加以总结后，再推广到群众中去的作法，不仅说明该报对推广陈永康丰产经验具有一定的计划性和目的性，而且对引导农民群众如何正确地学习丰产经验，更具有重要的教育作用。
    解放日报在宣传陈永康丰产经验中，也并不是没有缺点的。华东广大地区都是以种水稻为主，可是只报道了松江、萧山、无锡及上海市郊区极少数地区学习和推广陈永康水稻丰产经验，至于其他许多地区是否学习和推广了这种丰产经验，在推广中又有什么困难，该报就没有再加以报道。这就表明解放日报还缺乏运用批评、检查的方法，来督促各地有重点地推广和坚持这一有效的丰产经验。因此，今后仍应继续加强和改进这个宣传。
