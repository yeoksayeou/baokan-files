    Statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government,
    on the Recognition of the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, was authorized on July 13, 1952, to declare as follows:

    In accordance with Article 55 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which states that "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall examine all treaties and agreements concluded by the Kuomintang government with foreign governments and shall, according to their content, recognize, abrogate, revise, or re-negotiate them," the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has reviewed the "Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field," the "Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea," the "Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War," and the "Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War," signed in Geneva on August 12, 1949, in the name of China.

    The Central People's Government considers that the content of these conventions is basically conducive to lasting international peace and conforms to humanitarian principles, and therefore decides to recognize them.

    The Central People's Government also declares that, with regard to these conventions, there are still certain principles that the Central People's Government considers extremely important and must adhere to: for example, that the substitute for the protecting power must be agreed upon by the protected power's country, that the original detaining power should not be released from responsibility after prisoners of war or wounded and sick persons have been transferred to another country, that the protection of the convention should also apply to civilians outside the occupied territory, and that prisoners of war convicted of war crimes under the principles of the Nuremberg and Tokyo International Military Tribunals should not enjoy the benefits of the convention; the Central People's Government is prepared to submit reservations regarding the relevant clauses in these aspects when ratifying the conventions, in order to better facilitate the effective and satisfactory implementation of these conventions.

    This statement has also been instructed to the Chargé d'Affaires of the People's Republic of China in Switzerland to notify the Swiss Federal Government by note to inform the governments of the contracting parties of the conventions.

    Beijing, July 13, 1952

    中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长
    为承认一九四九年八月十二日日内瓦各公约的声明
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来于一九五二年七月十三日受权声明如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五十五条“对于国民党政府与外国政府所订立的各项条约和协定，中华人民共和国中央人民政府应加以审查，按其内容，分别予以承认，或废除，或修改，或重订”的规定，对于一九四九年八月十二日在日内瓦，以中国名义签字的“改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇之公约”，“改善海上武装部队伤者病者及遇船难者境遇之公约”，“关于战俘待遇之公约”及“关于战时保护平民之公约”，均经加以审查。
    中央人民政府认为各该公约内容在基本上是有利于国际持久和平、并符合于人道主义原则的，因此，决定予以承认。
    中央人民政府同时声明，关于各该公约，尚有经中央人民政府认为极属重要必须坚持的若干原则：例如，关于保护国之代替者必须经被保护者本国同意，关于战俘或伤病员等被移交于他国后原拘留国仍不应解除责任，关于占领区以外平民亦应适用公约之保护，关于依据纽伦堡及东京国际军事法庭审判原则被判为战争罪犯的战俘不得享受公约利益等；中央人民政府准备在批准各该公约时，提出关于这些方面的有关条款的保留，以便更有利于各该公约的有效和圆满的执行。
    本声明并经训令中华人民共和国驻瑞士公使以照会通知瑞士联邦政府转告各该公约的各缔约国政府。
    一九五二年七月十三日于北京
