The handling of urban sewage and rainwater is a major issue concerning environmental hygiene and people's lives. For many years, the vast majority of Beijing residents have suffered almost daily because of this. Now, this suffering has been basically eliminated.

According to a survey by the People's Government, when Beijing was first liberated three years ago, only 240 kilometers of the city's 755 kilometers of streets had sewers, and only 3 percent of households had sewer facilities. In addition, there were a small number of seepage wells that could accommodate the sewage of a very small number of households. The vast majority of the remaining people had no choice but to dump all their sewage, from washing dishes and vegetables to washing clothes and faces, into the streets. This was naturally very unhygienic, and particularly distressing in the summer. When it rained, the streets were muddy everywhere, and some places even turned into a "vast ocean." There were more than 160 places in the city with such serious water accumulation, and in the most serious places, residents not only had to rush to save their belongings, but also had to worry about their houses collapsing.

Longxu Ditch, as many people now know, was one of eight open ditches in the city. The stinking ditch water was green, and some of it turned into black sludge, containing dead cats, dead dogs, and dead rats. Whenever there was a heavy rain, the ditch water mixed with garbage would flood into the houses, and maggots with big tails would crawl onto the beds and walls. All those who suffered from this disaster were working people. At the same time, these stinking ditches and accumulated water inevitably bred various infectious germs, which was a serious threat to all the people of the city.

Now this problem has been solved.

First, the People's Government made full use of the historical legacy.

As early as the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty in the early 15th century, our ancestors built a grand sewer system in Beijing. However, it had been in disrepair for many years, and most of the ditches were silted up, with an average of 0.5 cubic meters of silt in each meter of the ditch. Some of it had even collapsed. Therefore, some people once thought that it was no longer usable and that a completely new one had to be built. But this view was completely incorrect.

After Soviet experts personally inspected the ditches, they believed that the sewer system was still very solid; as long as it was dredged and repaired, it could be used for a considerable period of time. If it were completely rebuilt, it would require a lot of manpower and materials, and it could not be done in a short period of time.

Therefore, the People's Government decided to dredge and repair all the old ditches, while focusing on new construction. In the past three years, including this year's project, the People's Government has dredged and repaired a total of 210 kilometers of old ditches, restoring their drainage function; the newly built projects total 80 kilometers, which is about one-third of the original ditches.

In terms of renovating the old ditches, the biggest difficulty was figuring out the routes of these ditches. We couldn't just tear up all the streets and houses to take a look. The Ming Dynasty only left a few written records, and the streets have changed greatly, making it difficult to investigate. For example, "Quanjude," the Peking duck restaurant famous outside Qianmen, originally faced Qianmen Street. But now a row of shops has been built in front of it. The sewer that was originally under the street is now hidden under the roofs of these shops. There are quite a few similar situations in Beijing.

What the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang left behind in terms of sewers were just some ugly stories of corruption. It is said that the Qing Dynasty had to dredge the ditches once a year. After the dredging, a worker had to crawl into the ditch pipe from one end and crawl out from the other end to show that it had really been cleared. But often one person crawled in and another person crawled out. What about the Kuomintang era? They often dug up the roads and then filled them in, without putting the pipes in at all. Sometimes, they only installed pipes at both ends of a street, but the middle was not connected.

Regarding the routes, the archives received by the People's Government were just an imaginary map drawn by the Japanese invaders during their occupation of Beijing, which was of course completely unreliable. This underground secret has now been basically clarified. This is the result of the People's Government relying on the masses and conducting in-depth investigations and research among the residents.

In terms of building new sewers, the People's Government first paid attention to the eight dirty and stinking open ditches and other places with serious water accumulation. Longxu Ditch was converted into a covered ditch in 1950. The original stinking ditch has become a wide road. Some of the other open ditches have also been repaired in the same way, and some are under construction. All of them can be completed before the end of November this year. The problem of water accumulation has been basically solved.

The newly built sewers are very large in scale. The newly built ditch in Tongfasi has a diameter of 2.6 meters, which is not the largest one. I took a walk in the ditch pipe with several comrades from the Sanitary Engineering Bureau and felt like it was a large tunnel.

In areas where there are currently no sewers, the People's Government is calling on and assisting residents to build seepage wells to temporarily accommodate sewage and rainwater, allowing the water to seep into the ground. These seepage wells can be used for two to ten years. Although this is an expedient measure, it can solve the urgent problem at hand. Seepage wells are now very common. Residents of some streets have demolished old buildings to carry out construction. The enthusiasm of the people in actively responding to the government's call is inseparable from their love for an increasingly better new life.

In the future, the People's Government will continue to build a large number of new projects and gradually build a complete and modern sewer system. At that time, these seepage wells will be completely unnecessary.

### 北京下水道的新生

    北京下水道的新生
    新华社记者  沈容
    城市污水和雨水的处理，是环境卫生和人民生活中的大问题。多少年来，绝大多数的北京人民几乎每天都要为此而苦恼。现在这种苦恼基本上消除了。
    据人民政府调查，三年前北京刚解放的时候，全市七百五十五公里的街道中，只有二百四十公里有下水道，住户中有下水道设备的只占总户数的百分之三。此外，还有少量的渗井可以容纳极少数住户的污水。其余绝大多数的人，从洗碗、洗菜到洗衣、洗脸，所有的污水都只好往街上泼。这自然是很不卫生的，夏天尤其使人苦恼。下雨的时候，街上到处泥泞，有的地方甚至一片“汪洋”。这种严重积水的地方全市有一百六十多处，其中最严重的地方，居民们不仅要忙着抢救东西，而且要担心房屋倒塌。
    龙须沟，现在很多人都知道了，原来市内这样的明沟共有八条之多。臭沟水泛着绿色，有的成了黑色的泥浆，这里面有死猫死狗死耗子。一到下大雨，沟水夹杂着垃圾漫进屋子，长着大尾巴的蛆爬到炕上，爬到墙上。遭受这种灾害的全部是劳动人民。同时，这种臭沟和积水必然滋生各种传染病菌，这对于全市人民都是一个严重的威胁。
    现在这个问题已解决了。
    首先，人民政府充分利用了历史的遗产。
    远在十五世纪初期明朝永乐年间，我们的祖先就在北京修建了一个规模宏大的下水道系统。但是年久失修，大部分沟道都淤塞了，平均每一公尺的沟道里就有零点五立方公尺的淤泥。有的并且塌掉了。因此，曾经有人以为它不堪继续使用，非全部修建新的不可。但是这种意见是完全不正确的。
    苏联专家亲自进入沟道检查之后，认为这个下水道系统还很坚固；只要加以掏挖和整修还可以利用相当长的时候。如果全部重新修建，既需要大量的人力物力，也不是短时期内所能办到的。
    因此人民政府决定把所有旧沟道加以掏挖和整修，同时有重点地进行新的修建。三年来，包括今年的工程在内，人民政府掏挖和整修的旧沟道共有二百一十公里，使它们恢复了宣泄的作用；新建的工程共八十公里，约相当于原有沟道的三分之一。
    在整顿旧沟道方面，最大的困难是弄不清这些沟道的线路。我们不能把所有的街道和房屋都翻开来看一看。明朝只留下少数文字记载，而街道变化很大，难于考察。比如前门外以烤鸭著名的“全聚德”本来面临前门大街。但是现在它门前已建起了一排店铺。本来在大街下面的下水道因此就藏到这些店铺的屋下了。全北京类似的情况很不少。
    清朝和国民党在下水道方面所留下的，只是一些贪污的丑史。据说清朝每年要掏挖一次沟道，掏挖后，要叫一个工人从沟管的这一头钻进去，从另一头钻出来，表示这里面真正挖通了。可是常常钻进去的是一个人，钻出来的却是另外一个人。国民党时代怎样呢？他们常常把道路挖开来，接着又填平了，根本没有把管子放进去。有的时候，他们只在某一条街的两头安下管子，当中却是不通的。
    有关线路方面，人民政府所接收的档案，只是一张日寇在占领北京时期画的臆想图，这当然完全不可靠。这个地下秘密现在基本上弄清楚了。这是人民政府依靠群众，深入居民进行调查研究的结果。
    在修建新下水道方面，人民政府首先注意到的是八条又脏又臭的大明沟和其他严重积水的地方。龙须沟已在一九五○年改为暗沟。原来的臭沟成了宽阔的马路。其他的明沟有的也已经同样修好，有的正在修建。今年十一月底以前全部可以完成。积水问题已基本上解决。
    新兴建的下水道，规模是十分巨大的。在铜法寺新建的沟道，直径有二米六，这还不是规模最大的一处。我和卫生工程局的几位同志在沟管里走了一趟，觉得简直有点像一条大隧道。
    目前还没有下水道的地方，人民政府号召并协助居民修建渗井，暂时容纳污水和雨水，让水渗透到地底下去。这种渗井可以用两年到十年不等。这虽然是权宜的办法，但可以解决当前迫切的问题。现在渗井已十分普遍。有的街道的居民拆掉了废旧的建筑物来进行修建。人民群众这种积极响应政府号召的热忱，是和他们对日益美好的新生活的热爱分不开的。
    今后人民政府还将继续大量兴建新的工程，逐渐建设成一个完整的现代化的下水道系统，那时这些渗井就完全用不着了。
