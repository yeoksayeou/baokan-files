    State-Owned Economy Should Vigorously Lead Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Invigorate the Market and Develop Production
    Yang Fangxun
    Since February this year, due to the concentration of efforts on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, coupled with the arrival of the off-season, a temporary sluggishness occurred in markets in various regions. Some private factories suspended work or reduced production, some industrial products and native products could not be sold, and market transaction volumes decreased. In order to rapidly restore production and invigorate the market, in late February the Central People's Government instructed all state economic departments to strengthen their business work. In addition to actively organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, they should vigorously carry out processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending to private industrial and commercial enterprises to help them solve difficulties in production and operation. For example, in April, the Shanghai State-Owned Trading Company's processing and ordering volume for the private nail industry reached the industry's normal daily output. In Wuxi City, Southern Jiangsu, 430 private textile factory looms were idle. Recently, due to the increase in processing orders from the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, they have all started operating again. The Tianjin Department Store purchased large quantities of goods accumulated by private factories, solving the problem of capital turnover for 186 factories. People's Banks in various regions also expanded loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises. The total amount of loans nationwide in June increased by 58 percent compared to May and by 185 percent compared to the same period last year. The Beijing People's Bank alone lent out 46.8 billion yuan from April 27 to May 15, solving the production and operation difficulties of 7,305 industrial and commercial households. With the active support of the state-owned economy, the market situation began to improve in May. For example, the trading volume of cotton cloth in Beijing increased by 50 percent in May compared to April. The national trading volume of cotton yarn increased by 21.1 percent from June 1 to 20 compared to the same period in May, and cloth also increased by 6.1 percent.
    Article 30 of the Common Program stipulates: "The People's Government shall encourage the initiative of private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and assist their development." The People's Government has consistently implemented this policy. The series of work recently carried out by state economic departments to rapidly restore and develop production and invigorate the market fully demonstrates this point.
    How does the state-owned economy support the private economy?
    First, the state's assistance to private enterprises is determined based on their relationship to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as their own operating conditions and actual difficulties. To this end, many regions have conducted investigations and research work, first distinguishing which industries can be developed and which industries need to be converted, and then assisting their development or educating them to change their professions based on different situations. For example, after the Jiangnan Paper Mill in Shanghai eliminated the "Five Evils," its products were all sold by the department store, and the People's Bank provided loans to help it move from suspension of work to resumption of production. For some manufacturers with no development prospects or who are extremely unsound and started by speculation and fraud, the People's Government does not provide assistance and educates them to change their professions.
    Second, in order to enable private enterprises to quickly obtain loans and restore production, the People's Bank has tried to simplify procedures as much as possible. For example, the Wuhan People's Bank, taking into account the difficulty of ordinary industrial and commercial households in obtaining guarantees, decided that those who pledge loans, sign a tripartite contract (that is, they have signed a contract with the government for processing and ordering and also signed a contract with the bank), and industries introduced through certain organizations (such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, etc.) can be granted loans without guarantee; small loans can also be granted without guarantee as appropriate.
    Third, in the process of processing and ordering, state-owned trading companies must prevent the "Five Evils" behavior of illegal capitalists and give capitalists reasonable profits to encourage private enterprises to actively engage in production. Guangzhou is calculating new standards for processing materials and expenses in accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. Before the new standard is approved, a method of first placing orders by agreement and calculating according to the new standard in the future will be temporarily adopted. The deposit for processing and ordering was originally 20 percent in advance, but recently it has been appropriately increased based on specific circumstances. In the ordering contracts between the Shanghai Department Store and private factories, reasonable adjustments are made to some commodities with excessively low prices. For example, the price of steel pens produced by the Hongguang Steel Pen Factory once fell to 52,000 yuan per dozen in March. Recently, when the department store signed long-term ordering contracts, the price was raised to 57,000 yuan in order to guarantee reasonable profits for the capital side. In order to prevent the "Five Evils" activities of illegal capitalists, the trade unions of private factories, in cooperation with the trading company and the People's Bank and other relevant parties, also supervised the factory's production.
    Fourth, in the process of assisting private enterprises, the state guides their business direction and reduces the blindness of their production. The East China Department Store recently signed long-term ordering and sales contracts with several private factories. After the Great Wall Pencil Factory signed a long-term contract with the department store, it formulated a "Raw Material Supply Plan," signed raw material supply contracts with relevant manufacturers, and also formulated a "Semi-Finished Product Circulation Plan," which can ensure that funds, raw materials, and the production process can be continuously circulated according to plan without interruption. Therefore, Guo Zhiming, the capitalist of the factory, said with full confidence: "The long-term contract of the department store is like a bright light, guiding our production. In the future, I must operate well under the leadership of the state-owned economy and overcome the past thinking of simply pursuing profits."
    With the strong support of the state-owned economy and the active unity of workers and capitalists in production, many capitalists have shown initiative in management and production. For example, the capitalist of the Lihua Weaving Factory in Hankou has invested 50 million yuan to repair the factory buildings and is preparing to increase capital by 100 million yuan, and borrow a portion of the loan from the bank to improve and expand production.
    However, in the process of state-owned economic departments processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending to private enterprises, it is still found that some capitalists have the wrong idea of ​​"using public funds to support private interests." They simply rely on government assistance, and do not actively overcome difficulties and improve management. Some factories have low product quality, but they demand that the government purchase them at high prices.
    These private industrialists and businessmen should see the great prospects of the new China's great economic construction and see their own development prospects in this great economic construction. They should overcome negative and wrong ideas, abide by the Common Program, and work hard to operate their own enterprises.

    国营经济要大力领导私营工商业活跃市场发展生产
    杨方勋
    今年二月以来，由于大家集中力量进行“三反”和“五反”，加之淡季的到来，各地市场曾发生暂时性的呆滞现象。有的私营工厂停工减产，有些工业品与土特产品推销不出去，市场交易量减少。为了迅速恢复生产、活跃市场，二月下旬中央人民政府即指示各国家经济部门，加强业务工作，除了积极组织城乡物资交流外，并应大力进行对私营工商业的加工、订货、收购、贷款等项工作，帮助其解决生产中与经营中的困难。例如上海市国营贸易公司四月份对私营元钉业的加工、订货数量，已达到该业的正常日产量。苏南无锡市私营纺织厂有四百三十台布机停工，最近由于国营花纱布公司对他们的加工数量增加，便都转动起来了。天津市百货公司大量收购私营工厂积压的商品，替一百八十六家工厂解决了资金周转的困难。各地人民银行，对私营工商业也扩大贷款，六月份全国贷款总额较五月份增加百分之五十八。较去年同期增加百分之一百八十五。北京市人民银行，仅四月二十七日至五月十五日即贷出四百六十八亿元，解决了七千三百零五户工商业生产与经营中的困难。在国营经济积极扶植下，从五月份起，市场情况就开始好转。如北京市纱布成交量，五月较四月增加百分之五十。全国棉纱的成交量，六月一日至二十日比五月同期增加百分之二十一点一，布匹也增加百分之六点一。
    共同纲领第三十条规定：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”人民政府一贯地执行着这一政策。从最近国家经济部门为了迅速恢复与发展生产、活跃市场所进行的一系列工作来看，更充分地证明这一点。
    国营经济是怎样扶持私营经济的呢？
    第一、国家对私营企业的扶助，是根据其对国计民生的利害关系，以及本身经营情况和实际困难而定。为此，许多地区都进行了调查研究工作，首先分别那些行业可以发展；那些行业需要转业，然后分别不同情况，扶助其发展，或教育他们转业。如上海江南造纸厂，消除“五毒”之后，产品由百货公司全部运销，人民银行又给予贷款，帮助其由停工走向恢复生产。对于某些无发展前途或者本身极不健全，靠投机盗骗起家的厂商，人民政府则不予扶助，并教育他们转业。
    第二、人民银行为了使私营企业迅速取得贷款，恢复生产，尽量简化手续。如武汉市人民银行照顾一般工商户取保的困难，决定凡质押放款，签订有三角合同（即为政府加工订货和银行又签订有合同）者，和经过一定组织介绍（如工商局等）的行业，都可以免保贷款；小额贷款，也可以酌量情况免保。
    第三、国营贸易公司在加工订货中，一方面要防止不法资本家的“五毒”行为，同时又要给资本家以合理的利润，以便鼓励私营企业积极进行生产。广州市正按照公私兼顾的原则，核算新的加工用料和费用标准。在新标准未核定前，暂时采取先以协议订货，将来照新标准计算的办法。加工订货的订金原为先付百分之二十，最近已分别具体情况适当提高。上海市百货公司和私营工厂的订货合同中，对某些价格偏低的商品，进行合理调整。如红光钢笔厂出产的钢笔三月间价格曾下降至每打五万二千元，最近百货公司在订长期订货合同时，为了保障资方合理的利润，已将价格提高为五万七千元。为了防止不法资本家的“五毒”活动，私营工厂的工会配合贸易公司与人民银行等有关方面也对工厂生产进行了监督。
    第四、国家在对私营企业的扶助过程中，指导其经营方向，减少其生产的盲目性。华东区百货公司最近和若干私营工厂订立长期订货与包销合同。长城铅笔厂和百货公司订立长期合同后，制定了“原材料供应计划”，与有关厂商订立原材料供应合同，还订立了“再制品流转计划”，这样就能保证资金、原料和生产过程，都能按计划连续的流转，不致中断。因此，该厂资方郭志明满怀信心地说：“百货公司的长期合同，像一盏明灯一样，指导着我们的生产。今后我一定要在国营经济领导下，好好经营，克服过去单纯追求利润的思想。”
    在国营经济大力扶助和职工主动团结资方进行生产的情况下，许多资本家表现了经营与生产的积极性。如汉口市利华织布厂的资方，已投资五千万元修理厂房，并准备增加资本一亿元，再向银行贷一部分款，改进并扩大生产。
    但是，在国营经济部门对私营企业进行加工、订货、收购、贷款的过程中，仍发现有些资本家产生“以公养私”的错误思想。他们单纯依靠政府的扶助，不积极克服困难，改善经营。有的工厂产品质量低，却要求政府高价收买。
    这些私营工商业家，应当看到新中国伟大的经济建设的远景，并看到自己在这个伟大经济建设中的发展前途，应当克服消极的错误的思想，遵守共同纲领，努力经营自己的企业。
