Anecdotes of Pastoral Life
    Zhang Jianqiu

    In late April of this year, all the staff of the Third Farm of the Mengjin Farm in Xinjiang Military Region, responding to the call of the higher authorities to develop animal husbandry, shouldered their rifles, drove cattle and sheep, and entered the boundless grasslands, cheerfully singing a quick-rhythm song they had written themselves:
    We put down our hoes and picked up our guns,
    We raise our whips and drive cattle and sheep,
    Houses, pots and pans are loaded on the backs of cows,
    Happily marching towards the livestock farm.

    They were originally very unfamiliar with pastoral life, but because they brought into play their collective wisdom, and learned from books and local old herdsmen, they overcame difficulties and opened up the road to animal husbandry. They sang:
    We settle down at the foot of the mountain,
    We camp by the water,
    We drink clear streams,
    We burn firewood from the mountains;
    Cattle, sheep, and horses are not cramped,
    The herdsmen smile.

    They grasped the laws of pastoral life, setting out at dawn and resting at sunset. When camping, they also happily sang:
    The sun sets and the sky darkens, the cattle and sheep are penned in, the earth is our bed, the green grass is our blanket, the blue sky is our cover, the moon is our lamp, the wind sweeps the floor, the cattle and sheep herds are our companions.

    They cherished the national property – cattle, sheep, and horses – as they cherished their own eyes, and at all times guarded against the jackals that came and went in the mountains. They sang heroically:
    There are many jackals in the mountains,
    We must stand guard at night,
    Holding our guns tightly in our hands,
    Not afraid of the jackals running wild;
    Holding our guns tightly in our hands,
    Protecting the sheep so they can sleep soundly.

    They lived on the grassland, more than a hundred li away from the city. Without cooking utensils, they used willow branches instead of steamers; without green vegetables, they put forward the slogan of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, relying on the water to eat the water." They leisurely sang: To eat steamed buns, but no steamer, we must think of ways to use our brains, find seven or eight willow branches, lay each one flat in the pot, three vertical, four horizontal, steamed buns are fragrant. No green vegetables, we go up the mountain to find them, pulling wild onions from the cracks in the rocks. No firewood, we go into the mountains, walking around and carrying back a bundle. To eat water, no need to carry it, the stove is built by the clear water.

    All the hardships and difficulties were overcome by their spirit of loving the motherland and loving labor, and they had greater confidence in developing animal husbandry. They happily sang:
    To see far, we go up the high mountain,
    The grassland of Tianshan is boundless,
    It can graze tens of millions of cattle and sheep,
    There are conditions for developing animal husbandry.

    To build a socialist economy,
    Cattle and sheep are good capital,
    All kinds of factories need raw materials,
    Hides and wool are good resources,
    All difficulties are overcome,
    A happy life is in sight. (Xinhua News Agency)

    畜牧生活板话
    张剑秋
    今年四月下旬，新疆军区猛进农场第三场的全体工作人员，响应上级发展畜牧业的号召，扛起枪杆，赶着牛羊，走进一望无际的草原，愉快地唱着自己编写的快板：
    放下锄头扛起枪，
    扬起鞭子赶牛羊，
    房屋锅碗驮在牛背上，
    高高兴兴走向畜牧场。
    他们对畜牧生活原来是非常生疏的，但由于他们发挥了集体的智慧，并从书本上和向当地老牧人吸取了经验，因而克服了困难，打开了从事畜牧的前进道路。他们唱着：
    靠山下寨，
    遇水扎营，
    饮水有清流，
    烧柴有山林；
    牛羊马，不受窘，
    放牧人，笑吟吟。
    他们掌握了牧畜生活的规律，天明出发，日落歇宿。在宿营时，他们又快乐地唱着：
    日落天色晚，牛羊扎了圈，大地是床铺，绿草是毛毯，盖的是蓝天，月亮当灯风扫地，牛羊马群作伴侣。
    他们对祖国财产——牛羊马的爱护，如同爱护自己的眼睛一样，时时刻刻防备着出没山林的豺狼。他们雄壮地唱道：
    山中多豺狼，
    夜晚要站岗，
    紧握手中枪，
    不怕豺狼逞凶狂；
    紧握手中枪，
    保护牛羊睡的香。
    他们住在草原上，离城有百余里。没有炊具，他们用柳条代替了蒸笼；没有青菜，他们提出了“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的口号。他们悠然唱着：吃蒸馍，没蒸笼，多想办法动脑筋，找上柳条七八根，根根平放锅当中，竖三根，横四根，蒸熟馍馍香喷喷。没青菜，上山寻，石头缝里拔野葱。没柴火，进山林，转个圈圈背一捆。要吃水，不用担，锅灶修在清水边。
    所有的艰难困苦都被他们热爱祖国、热爱劳动的精神克服了，他们对发展畜牧业有了更大的信心。他们高兴地歌唱：
    要远看，上高山，
    天山的草原大无边，
    能放牛羊几万万，
    发展畜牧业有条件。
    要建设社会主义的经济，
    牛羊就是好本钱，
    各种工厂要原料，
    皮毛就是好资源，
    一切的困难都克服，
    美满的生活在眼前。（新华社）
