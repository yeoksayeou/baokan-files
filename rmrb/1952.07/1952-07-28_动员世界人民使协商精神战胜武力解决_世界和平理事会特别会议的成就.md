    Mobilizing the People of the World to Make the Spirit of Consultation Triumph over the Use of Force
    --Report at the Welcome Rally for People from All Walks of Life in the Capital on July 26th
　　Guo Moruo
     I. Extraordinary International Situation
    U.S. imperialism is pushing forward its world aggression policy more and more frantically.
    The U.S. government has set a four-year long-term military expansion plan, and the direct military expenditure of the United States will reach 250 billion U.S. dollars in the next four years. Direct and indirect military expenditures account for 80 percent of the entire budget.
    In the midst of the frenzy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, the U.S. government has intensified its efforts to support the puppet governments of Japan and West Germany, enabling militarism and fascism to revive rapidly, using them as tools to invade the world simultaneously from the East and West.
    On September 8th of last year, the one-sided "Treaty of Peace with Japan" and the so-called "U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty" were concluded in San Francisco without the participation of China, the Soviet Union, India, and Burma. On February 28th of this year, the U.S. and Japan signed an "Administrative Agreement." According to these "treaties" and "agreements," the United States can station troops in Japan for a long time, and Japan has formally become a U.S. military base for aggression against Asia.
    On April 28th, the U.S. government announced that those "treaties" and "agreements" imposed on the Japanese people officially took effect, and unilaterally announced the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan, which were jointly organized by all countries that fought against Japan after its surrender.
    After this, manipulated by the U.S. government, the Yoshida puppet government of Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also concluded a so-called "treaty of peace," deliberately antagonizing the Chinese people.
    These are the recent developments of U.S. imperialism fostering Japanese aggressive forces in the East.
    Fostering the aggressive forces of West Germany in the West is proceeding in the same steps.
    On May 26th of this year, the governments of the U.S., Britain, France, and West Germany signed the so-called "General Treaty" in Bonn. This is completely the same in nature as the one-sided "Treaty of Peace with Japan" in San Francisco. It is a war treaty that completely violates the Potsdam Agreement. Its purpose is to split Germany, foster the remaining Nazi forces in West Germany, and make Germany a second Korea. This treaty has passed its first reading in the Bonn parliament, but it still needs to go through second and third readings. The German people want to concentrate their efforts to prevent its passage.
    Secondly, under the pressure of the U.S. government, on May 27th, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany signed the "European Defense Community" treaty in Paris. This is an expansion of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It aims to organize a so-called "European Army," using the military forces fostered in West Germany as its backbone, under the command of the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. The most absurd clause in this "European Defense Community" treaty stipulates the production of atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons and their use for war purposes. Seeing this arrogant flame, it is not only to make Germany a second Korea, but also to make Europe a second Korea.
    In addition to this, we must naturally add the actual situation of the Korean War, which is of concern to the people of the world.
    The Korean War has been going on for two full years. The armistice negotiations have also been delayed for a whole year. During the armistice negotiations, the U.S. aggressors started using bacteriological weapons on a large scale half a year ago. This sinful act has shocked the ears of the people all over the world. At the end of June, the U.S. aggressors even bombed the peaceful hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River.
    The bombing of the Yalu River power plants caused a greater reaction in capitalist countries than the bacteriological warfare. Many government officials and members of parliament in capitalist countries were deeply afraid that the war would expand from this, and that the Third World War would break out. International public opinion was in turmoil.
    In this way, the "frenzied march of the world aggression policy" directed by the U.S. government and U.S. generals concentrated its strength and desperately played in the first half of 1952.
    Therefore, the international situation appears extraordinarily tense.
    II. Opening up a broader base for the cause of peace
    Under such a particularly tense international situation, people with good will felt that peace seemed to be reaching a dead end, and that peace seemed to be reaching the point where it needed a stimulant.
    But we must understand that this tense situation was deliberately created by the U.S. government and U.S. generals. Marshall of the United States said long ago that they wanted to create ten years of international tension. That way, they would be able to continue to expand their armaments and prepare for war, and U.S. capitalists would be able to obtain excessive military profits for a long time, fattening themselves by sucking the blood of others. But the U.S. government and U.S. generals did not expect that their "frenzied march" would gradually arouse the worries and aversion of the people of the world.
    The U.S. government and generals are desperately expanding armaments and preparing for war, threatening the lives and livelihoods of the people of the countries concerned, while the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other New Democratic countries that they are hostile to are focusing on peaceful construction and increasing the happiness of the people. Prominent recent facts, such as the completion of the new canal connecting the Volga and Don rivers in the Soviet Union, and the achievements of the Huai River project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project in China, are admired by the people of the world.
    The U.S. government and generals are desperately implementing embargo policies to block the Soviet Union, China, and other New Democratic countries, hoping to gain a monopoly of benefits, resulting in the economic turnover of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, and even large capitalists, in many countries being frozen, forcing them to find a way out. The Soviet Union, China, and other New Democratic countries in the peace camp are calling for fair trade on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, opening up avenues for those who are looking for a way out. The reason why the Moscow International Economic Conference in April of this year achieved remarkable results was due to this subtle opportunity.
    In the Korean War, the contrast between the two camps is even clearer. On one side is interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the use of inhuman bacteriological and chemical weapons, the mass slaughter of peaceful residents, the wanton destruction of peaceful cities and peaceful construction, the brutal abuse of prisoners of war, and the constant attempts to expand the war; while on the other side is the heroic and unyielding defense of their own country, the rescue of their neighbors, the prevention of the expansion of the war, and the guarantee of Asian peace and world peace. Here, an unprecedentedly noble moral righteousness contrasts with unprecedentedly brutal crimes.
    In such a contrasting comparison, the people of the world are gradually recognizing the true faces of the U.S. government and U.S. generals.
    The U.S. government and generals often play with beautiful words such as "peace," "humanity," and "freedom." Their excuse is that "the world is suffering from communist aggression." Their arms expansion, war preparations, blockade, and embargo are out of "defense," in order to "consolidate peace, respect humanity, and defend freedom." However, the evil deeds they are frantically carrying out are completely contrary to what they say.
    The U.S. government and generals are in the current situation where "all the good words have been said, and the bad things are about to be done."
    Since people have gradually recognized the truth about the United States, feeling the need to save peace, and feeling the need to find a way out for themselves, this is conducive to the movement to defend peace and has opened up a broader base for the cause of peace.

    III. Significance and Course of the Special Meeting
    The Third Session of the World Peace Council was convened under such a situation. The first session was at the end of February last year, and the second session was at the beginning of November last year, eight months apart. According to the procedure, the third session should only be a regular meeting. However, due to the extraordinary situation, this session was named "Special Meeting" or "Extraordinary Meeting."
    The meeting was originally planned to be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, but in order to adapt to the situation, especially the current situation in Germany, it was changed to Berlin.
    The meeting was held for six days, from July 1st to 6th. Fifty-nine countries participated in the meeting. Of the 67 member states of the council, 55 countries participated with 102 council members. There were many specially invited representatives. The Standing Committee issued 218 invitations, and 138 specially invited representatives attended, more than the number of council members attending. Many of these specially invited representatives are capitalists from various countries who have always been quite distant from the peace movement. The attendance of so many specially invited representatives, and the broad nature of the representatives, is another reason why this meeting was named a "Special Meeting."
    The agenda of the conference was divided into three items. The first was the peaceful settlement of the German and Japanese issues. The second was the Korean issue, including the bacteriological warfare issue. The third was the issue of convening a World People's Peace Congress, including issues such as disarmament and the conclusion of a peace convention. The delegates who attended the conference spoke around these three important topics. This shows an improvement in the way the meeting was conducted. In previous meetings, the speeches of the delegates who attended the meeting were not based on specific central issues, and each spoke on their own set of ideas.
    The speeches at the conference were very enthusiastic. In addition to Chairman Joliot-Curie's opening speech, Vice-Chairman Nenni's closing speech, Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Committee, and Mayor Ebert of Greater Berlin's welcoming speech, there were a total of 102 speakers. Among them, there were 54 council members and 42 specially invited representatives. Almost all of the countries that attended the meeting had the opportunity to speak.
    In the speeches, Chairman Joliot-Curie's opening speech played a decisive role in the leadership of the meeting. Soviet writer Ehrenburg's "Speaking to the American People," French National Peace Council Chairman Faji's "What I Saw and Heard in Korea," and the Chinese representative's "General Introduction to the Korean Issue" were warmly welcomed. In addition, Soviet representative Korneichuk's "Report on Disarmament" and the Chinese representative's "Report on Bacteriological Warfare" were also praised. It was generally believed that these two reports were substantive and rich in reality and science. These important speeches contributed to the summarization of opinions and the creation of resolutions on the relevant topics.
    In order to produce resolutions, the conference was divided into three subcommittees according to the three central topics, to discuss and draft resolutions separately. The discussions in the subcommittees were more rigorous and meticulous. Some subcommittees held as many as ten meetings, and the drafted documents were completely rewritten as many as three or four times before they were finalized. In addition to the three subcommittees, there was also a core group, which was composed of the heads of the Standing Committee. The draft resolutions produced by the three subcommittees were submitted to the conference for adoption after final revision in the core group. In this way, the following five resolutions were obtained:
    1. Open letter to the governments of the four major powers and the people of the world on the German issue;
    2. Resolution on opposing the remilitarization of Japan and striving to establish a democratic Japan;
    3. Resolution on the issue of stopping the Korean War;
    4. Reaffirming the Standing Committee's Oslo meeting's "Against Bacteriological Warfare" letter to all men and women in the world;
    5. Declaration for convening a World People's Peace Congress.
    IV. Achievements of the Special Meeting
    The Special Meeting was a success.
    First of all, we can easily see that it expanded the foundation of the peace movement by grasping the subtle international situation. It won over a majority of the specially invited representatives, and many of them were people who had a considerable distance from the peace movement.
    Secondly, despite the different opinions and beliefs of the representatives who were won over, after the heated discussions in the plenary session and the small meetings, their opinions on the steps to save peace converged, and they reached a common resolution. All five important resolutions were passed unanimously by raising hands, without a single person objecting or abstaining.
    Thirdly, the five important resolutions dealt with the issues that are of the greatest concern to the people of the world, and the steps formulated were able to find the crux of the problems and formulated solutions that were to the point, fair, and reasonable. We believe that these resolutions fully meet the demands of the people of the world. Let us examine them one by one.
    Regarding the German issue, the conference demanded that the Potsdam Agreement be followed, that a conference of the four major powers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be convened immediately, that the German people establish a unified Germany through free elections, form a democratic government, and conclude a comprehensive and genuine treaty of peace with the countries concerned, and that the one-sided treaties of Bonn and Paris be destroyed. After the treaty of peace is concluded, foreign occupying troops should be withdrawn. This is a fair and reasonable solution, which is welcomed by the German people and hoped for by the people of the world. Regarding the Japanese issue, it also demanded that the Potsdam Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement be observed, that the Japanese people have full sovereignty, obtain democratic and peaceful development, and sign a genuine treaty of peace with all countries concerned, to replace the one-sided "Treaty" of San Francisco and the "treaties" and "agreements" that followed. After the genuine treaty of peace is concluded, foreign occupying troops should be withdrawn. This is a fair and reasonable solution, which is welcomed by the Japanese people and hoped for by the people of the world.
    Regarding the Korean issue, in addition to condemning the crimes of the United States, it demanded that "an armistice agreement be signed and hostilities be ended immediately in accordance with the principles of respect for international law and international practice"; in order to achieve this goal, it demanded that the U.S. delegation "abandon its unreasonable demands on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation"; after the end of hostilities, it demanded that "all foreign troops be withdrawn" "according to the will freely expressed by the Korean people" so that "Korea can re-establish lasting peace." The U.S. military is still using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, which is an issue concerning the dignity of all mankind, so it also demanded that "all countries ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, banning the use of bacteriological warfare methods." This is a fair and reasonable solution, which is welcomed by the Korean people and hoped for by the people of the world.
    Although the conduct of bacteriological warfare has aroused the anger of peace-loving and just people all over the world, the U.S. government and generals have not shown any remorse. The U.S. government has not only refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol, but also clearly stipulated in the so-called "European Defense Community Treaty" under its control the production of atomic energy, chemical, and bacteriological weapons and their use as war tools. This is a great betrayal of human civilization. The "Against Bacteriological Warfare" letter to all men and women in the world produced by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council at the Oslo meeting in early April was a solemn declaration representing all mankind. The resolution of the Standing Committee was re-passed at the special meeting of the Council, which is to expand the resolution of the Standing Committee into a resolution of the Council, which is of great significance. This not only shows the correctness of the Oslo meeting's resolution, but also shows that "opposition to bacteriological warfare" is a common demand of the people of the world.
    The last resolution of the special meeting, the "Declaration for Convening a World People's Peace Congress," is the prelude to the World People's Peace Congress to be held in December, and also a summary of all the resolutions of this special meeting. This concise and solemn declaration shows that the achievements of this special meeting have paved the way for the World People's Peace Congress.
     V. Prospects for the World People's Peace Congress
    The new name "World People's Peace Congress" was decided after discussion.
    Why not use the "Third World Congress for the Defense of Peace" and use this new name? The First World Congress for the Defense of Peace was held in Paris and Prague in April 1949, the Second was held in Warsaw in November 1950, and the third will be held in Vienna in December of this year. Wouldn't it be right and proper to call it the "Third World Congress for the Defense of Peace" to maintain the historical tradition?
    But after discussion, everyone felt that it was necessary to establish a new name. Because the world situation has changed, and the people of the world have new demands. Today, the relationship between the people of the world and peace has gone beyond the stage of "defense" and has entered the stage of "salvation." The last two sentences of the declaration say it very clearly and forcefully: "Peace can be saved! Peace must be saved!" Therefore, the "World People's Peace Congress," to put it fully, is the "World People's Congress to Save Peace." This may be a bit alarming, but the people of the world today do feel that peace has encountered a serious crisis. The people of the world hope that peace will be saved, and the task of the Peace Council is to satisfy this hope, call on the people to rise up to save it, and the people have the power to save peace in crisis. As far as we Chinese people are concerned, I feel that this is easier to understand. Because our patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has long been "saving peace."
    Therefore, the World People's Peace Congress is a congress to encourage the people to save peace, a grand review of the peace camp, to make the people aware of their own strength, not to be intimidated by the "frenzied march" of the war maniacs, but to rise up and stop it.
    We cannot allow pessimism, let alone being onlookers. Saving peace is saving ourselves, saving our children, saving our families, not to mention saving humanity, saving human civilization. Pessimism is a sin, and being an onlooker is even more sinful.
    The development of the international situation makes us have to think about the issue of people's responsibility. War instigators certainly have a responsibility, but the people who have the power to stop the war, if they do not recognize their own strength, condone the crimes of the war instigators without stopping them, are also responsible.
    The development of the international situation makes us have to think about the responsibility of the American people. The American people and the U.S. government and U.S. generals are of course different, but most of the American people still take a bystander attitude to this day, condoning their war maniacs without restraint, which is something that the people of the world cannot help but feel regret about.
    The "Against Bacteriological Warfare" letter to all men and women in the world from the Oslo meeting long ago made a special appeal to the American people:
    "We first appeal to the men and women of America, because each of them is faced with a question of integrity and character."
    Our Chinese representative at this special meeting also made a special appeal to the American people and American scientists in the "General Introduction to the Korean Issue":
    "The people of the world should unite to stop this serious danger of war. In particular, the American people have a moral responsibility to save the people of the world from unimaginable and cruel disasters.
    Scientists, especially American scientists, have a moral responsibility to make science forever serve human life, and rescue it from the degradation of becoming a tool for the mass slaughter of mankind."
    The most popular speech at this special meeting by Soviet writer Ehrenburg was especially directed to the American people. He hoped that the American people would no longer be deceived by the deceptive propaganda of the U.S. government and U.S. generals. He clearly told the American people: "To avoid the danger of war, people must sit at a table to negotiate. The Soviet people are willing to talk peace with any American, whether he is a Progressive, Republican, or Democrat. It wants to talk peace with the American workers, and it also wants to talk peace with the American capitalists; it wants to talk peace not only with its friends, but also with its enemies. It wants peace, not because it is afraid or weak, but because its heart is broad."
    Yes, we have the greatest confidence in the American people's "ability to reach an agreement and find a common way of action."
    What we hope for, as clearly pointed out in the declaration for convening the World People's Peace Congress, is to make "the spirit of consultation triumph over the use of force."
    Therefore, we can foresee that the World People's Peace Congress will surely awaken the sense of responsibility of the people all over the world to save peace, and especially awaken the responsibility of the American people to save peace.
    We are not going to question the American people, but we hope that the American people will recognize the truth of the facts, recognize their own strength, and unite with the peace-loving people all over the world to timely stop the "frenzied march of the world aggression policy" of the war maniacs.
    It is time for every American to quickly choose for himself whether to actively become a hero in saving world peace or passively become a sinner in human history.
     VI. The Responsibility of the Chinese People
    Our Chinese People's Delegation, entrusted by the Chinese people, participated in the special meeting and helped to produce various important resolutions. Our Chinese people naturally have the responsibility to support the various resolutions of the special meeting and to promote their realization one by one.
    We Chinese people have full sympathy for the German people. We express our heartfelt respect and are happy to support the brave men and women of Germany who are vigilant and courageous in their heroic struggle for the unity, democracy, independence, and peace of Germany. Although we are far apart, we are willing to strengthen our efforts to save peace in the East to echo the efforts far away in the West.
    The Japanese issue is almost equivalent to our own personal issue. We must also "express our respect for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people to strive for peace, independence, and democracy, and oppose militarism and the forces of war." We must not let the Japanese people be isolated, but must "give the greatest support" to their struggle.
    On the Korean battlefield, our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army stand shoulder to shoulder on the front line of saving peace. To practice the special meeting's resolution on the Korean armistice, the best way is to strengthen our production increase and economy campaign to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, crush the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war, eliminate the enemy's bacteriological warfare, and make the Korean issue win a fair and reasonable peaceful settlement.
    The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has decided to be held in Beijing this autumn. When our Chinese delegation participated in the meeting in Berlin, they had further contact with the representatives of the Asian and Pacific region. We have the responsibility to make this conference a success, to make this conference responsible for mobilizing for the World People's Peace Congress. We must mobilize the people of Asia and the Pacific region, especially the American people, to save the peace of Asia and the Pacific region and the peace of the world.
    Jefferson's America, Lincoln's America, Whitman's America, there must be many heroes like Robeson and Fast who are saving peace. We welcome them to overcome all difficulties and come to Beijing to jointly work hard to mobilize the people of Asia and the Pacific region, and to mobilize the people of the world.
    The power of the people is infinite. As long as we mobilize, unite, and organize, we can stop the arrogant attempts of a few war criminals.
    The spirit of consultation will surely triumph over the use of force.
    Therefore, we can foresee that the World People's Peace Congress will surely awaken the sense of responsibility of the people all over the world to save peace, and especially awaken the responsibility of the American people to save peace.
    We are not going to question the American people, but we hope that the American people will recognize the truth of the facts, recognize their own strength, and unite with the peace-loving people all over the world to timely stop the "frenzied march of the world aggression policy" of the war maniacs.
    It is time for every American to quickly choose for himself whether to actively become a hero in saving world peace or passively become a sinner in human history.

    动员世界人民使协商精神战胜武力解决
    ——世界和平理事会特别会议的成就
    （七月二十六日在首都各界人民欢迎大会上的报告）
　　郭沫若
     一、异乎寻常的国际局势
    美帝国主义推进着它的世界侵略政策，愈来愈疯狂了。
    美国政府订了四年的长期扩军计划，今后四年间美国的直接军费将要达到二千五百亿美元。直接军费和间接军费占全预算的百分之八十。
    在扩军备战的狂潮当中，美国政府更加加紧扶植日本和西德的傀儡政府，使军国主义和法西斯主义迅速地复活，作为从东西两方同时并进的侵略世界的工具。
    去年九月八日在旧金山缔结了没有中国、苏联、印度、缅甸参加的片面“对日和约”和所谓“美日双边安全条约”。今年二月二十八日，美日之间又签订了“行政协定”。根据这些“条约”和“协定”，美国可以在日本长期驻兵，日本已经正式成了美国侵略亚洲的军事基地。
    四月二十八日美国政府宣布那些强加在日本人民身上的“条约”和“协定”正式生效，并片面宣布解散在日本投降后由所有与日本作战的国家共同组织的远东委员会和盟国对日委员会。
    在这之后，又由美国政府的操纵，在日本吉田傀儡政府和蒋介石匪帮之间也缔结了所谓“和约”，存心与中国人民为敌。
    这些是美帝国主义在东方扶植日本侵略势力的近况。
    在西方扶植西德的侵略势力是以同样的步骤进行着的。
    今年五月二十六日美、英、法和西德的政府在波恩签订了所谓“一般性条约”。这和旧金山片面“对日和约”的性质是完全相同的。它是完全违背了波茨坦协定的战争条约，它的目的是在分裂德国，扶植西德的纳粹残余势力，使德国成为朝鲜第二。这条约在波恩议会已经经过了初读，但还须经过再读、三读，德国人民想集中力量来阻止它的通过。
    其次，在五月二十七日在美国政府压迫之下，法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和西德政府在巴黎又签订了“欧洲防务集团”条约，这是侵略性的北大西洋公约的扩大，要组织所谓“欧洲军”，把在西德所扶植起来的军事力量作为它的骨干，归北大西洋公约军最高统帅指挥。这个“欧洲防务集团”条约中最荒谬的条款，是规定着关于原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器的生产，并得为战争目的而使用。看这狂妄的气焰就不仅要使德国成为朝鲜第二，而且要使欧洲成为朝鲜第二了。
    在这之外，自然还要加上全世界人民所关心的朝鲜战争的实际情况。
    朝鲜战争已经满两周年了。停战谈判也被拖延了整整一年。在停战谈判当中，美国侵略者在半年以前竟开始了大规模的细菌武器的使用。这一罪恶行为已经悚动了全世界人民的听闻。到六月尾上美国侵略者更把鸭绿江上的和平建设的水力发电厂炸毁了。
    鸭绿江发电厂的被炸，在资本主义国家中所引起的反应，比细菌战所引起的还要大。好些资本主义国家的政府负责人和国会议员们都深怕战争会从此扩大，第三次世界大战会从此爆发。国际舆论为之骚然。
    就这样，由美国政府和美国将军们所指挥着的“世界侵略政策的狂燥进行曲”，在一九五二年的上半年特别集中了力量拚命地演奏着。
    因此，国际局势就显得异乎寻常地特别紧张。
    二、为和平事业开拓出了更广泛的基地
    在这样显得特别紧张的国际局势之下，怀有善良意志的人们都感觉到和平似乎临到了绝境，和平似乎临到了须得打强心针的地步了。
    但我们要了解，这样的紧张局势是美国政府和美国将军们所有意造成的。美国的马歇尔早就说过，他们要造成十年的国际紧张局势。那样就好让他们继续扩军备战，就好让美国的大资本家们长期获得超额的军事利润，靠吮吸别人的血来养肥自己。但美国政府和美国将军们却没有预计到，他们的“狂燥进行曲”逐渐引起了世界人民的忧虑和反感。
    美国的政府和将军们，他们拚命地在扩军备战，威胁着有关国家的人民的生活和生命，而他们所敌视的苏联、中华人民共和国和其它新民主主义国家，却在锐意进行和平建设，增进人民的幸福。显著的最近事实，如苏联的连贯伏尔加河与顿河的新运河的凿通，中国的淮河工程与荆江分洪工程的成就，都为全世界人民所景仰着。
    美国的政府和将军们，他们拚命地在执行禁运政策，来封锁苏联、中国和其它新民主主义国家，以期收到独占的利益，结果是使好些国家的中小工商 业者，甚至大资本家们的经济周转遭受了冻结，逼得他们不得不找寻生路。而和平阵营的苏联、中国和其它新民主主义国家却以平等互惠的公平交易相号召，为这些找寻生路者开辟了门径。今年四月莫斯科国际经济会议之所以获得显著的成就，就是由于这种微妙的机运所促成的。
    在朝鲜战争中，两个阵营的对比更是再显明也没有了。一边是干涉别国内政，使用违反人道的细菌武器和化学武器，大量屠杀和平居民，肆意毁灭和平城市与和平建设，狂暴地虐杀战俘，更时时企图把战争扩大；而另一边是英勇不屈地保卫自己的祖国，营救自己的邻人，制止着战争的扩大，使亚洲和平与世界和平得到保障。这儿是史无先例的崇高的道谊对比着史无先例的残暴的罪行。
    在这样两两相形的对比之下，世界人民是逐渐地认识到美国政府和美国将军们的真面目了。
    美国的政府和将军们，他们经常玩弄着“和平”、“人道”、“自由”这些美丽的辞令。他们的藉口是“世界受着共产主义的侵略”。他们的扩军备战、封锁禁运，是出于“防御”，是为了要“巩固和平、尊重人道、保卫自由”。然而他们所狂燥地进行着的罪恶行为却和他们嘴里所说的一套完全相反。
    美国的政府和将军们在目前的真相是“好话已经说尽，坏事快要做完”了。
    人们既已经逐渐认清了美国的真相，感觉着和平有拯救的必要，感觉着要切实地自己找寻生路，这就有利于保卫和平的运动，为和平事业开拓出了更广泛的基地。
    三、特别会议的意义和经过
    世界和平理事会第三次会议就是在这样的局势之下召开的。第一次会议是在去年二月下旬，第二次会议是在去年十一月上旬，相隔八个月开会一次，照程序上说来，第三次会议应该只是一个常会。但因为时局的非常，所以这一次的会议也就定名为“特别会议”或“非常会议”了。
    会议本来打算在芬兰的首都赫尔辛基召开，但为了适应时局，特别是德国当前的局势，所以改在柏林。
    会议自七月一日至六日，共开了六天。与会的国家五十九个。在六十七个理事国中有五十五国的理事参加，共一○二人。特邀代表特别多，常务委员会发出请柬二一八份，到会的特邀代表一三八人，多过到会的理事。这些特邀代表中有不少是各国的资本家，对于和平运动向来是颇有距离的。有这样多的特邀代表出席，而代表的性质又很广泛，这也是这次会议之所以能定名为“特别会议”的另一个原因。
    大会的议题分为三项，第一是和平解决德国和日本的问题，第二是朝鲜问题，包含着细菌战的问题在内，第三是召开世界人民和平大会的问题，包含着裁减军备和缔结和平公约等问题在内。到会的代表们围绕着这三项重要的议题发言。这在开会的方式上显示着有了改进，往次开会时，到会代表的发言是不依据一定的中心问题而各讲一套的。
    大会上的发言很踊跃。除去约里奥—居里主席的开幕词，南尼副主席的闭幕词，德国和平委员会主席腓特烈教授和大柏林市艾伯特市长的欢迎词之外，发言者共一○二人。其中理事五十四人，特邀代表四十二人，所有到会的国家几乎都有了发言的机会。
    在发言中，约里奥—居里主席的开幕词，对于会议的领导上起了决定性的作用。苏联大作家爱伦堡的“向美国人民说话”、法国全国和平理事会主席法奇的“在朝鲜所见所闻”、中国代表的“朝鲜问题的一般导言”，受到很热烈的欢迎。此外苏联代表考涅楚克的“关于裁减军备的报告”和中国代表
    “关于细菌战的报告”也受到称赞，一般认为这两个报告，内容充实，富于现实性与科学性。这些重要发言对于有关各项议题的意见的归纳和决议案的产生上是有了贡献的。
    为了产生决议案，大会依着三个中心议题分成了三个小组委员会，分别讨论和起草决议。小组会上的讨论更谨严而细致，有的小组开会至十次之多，起草的文件全部改写至三次四次始成定稿。在三小组之外还有一个核心小组，是常务委员会首脑部所组成的，三小组所产生的决议草案在核心小组中经过最后修正之后才提出大会通过。这样便得到了如下的五项决议：
    1、为德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书；
    2、关于反对日本重新军国主义化而争取建立民主的日本的决议；
    3、关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议；
    4、重申常务委员会奥斯陆会议“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书；
    5、为召开世界人民和平大会的宣言。
    四、特别会议的成就
    特别会议是有成就的。
    首先我们可以很容易地看出，它掌握着微妙的国际局势把和平运动的基础扩大了。它争取到了多数的特邀代表，而且多是对和平运动有相当距离的人。
    其次，所争取来的代表，尽管有不同的意见和信仰，经过大会和小会上的热烈的讨论，在拯救和平的步骤上意见却归于一致，而得出了共同的决议。五项重要的决议，都是全场一致举手通过的，没有一个人反对，也没有一个人弃权。
    其三，五项重要的决议案，所处理的都是全世界人民所最关切的问题，而所拟定的步骤都能找到问题的症结所在，一针见血地而又公平合理地拟具出了解决问题的方案。我们相信这些决议案是完全符合全世界人民的要求的，我们请来逐项地检讨一下吧。
    关于德国问题，大会所要求的是遵照波茨坦协定，立即召开美、英、法、苏四大国会议，让德国人民通过自由选举，建立统一的德国，成立民主的政府，与有关国家缔结全面的真正的和约，而毁弃波恩与巴黎的片面条约。和约缔结之后，撤退外国占领军队。这是公平合理的办法，是德国人民所欢迎，也是世界人民所希望的。关于日本问题，同样要求遵守波斯坦宣言和波茨坦协定，使日本人民有充分的主权，获得民主和平的发展，与一切有关国家签定真正的和约，以代替旧金山的片面“和约”和随之而来的“条约”与“协定”。真正的和平条约缔结之后撤退外国的占领军队。这是公平合理的办法，是日本人民所欢迎，也是世界人民所希望的。
    关于朝鲜问题，除谴责了美国的罪行之外，要求“在尊重国际法和国际惯例的原则下签订停战协议，立即结束敌对行动”；为了达到这个目的，要求美国代表团“放弃它在战俘遣返问题上的无理要求”；在敌对行动结束之后，要求“根据朝鲜人民自由表示的意志”“撤退一切外国军队”，使“朝鲜重新建立持久的和平”。美国军队在朝鲜和中国境内迄今都还在使用着细菌武器，这是有关全人类的尊严问题，故又要求“一切国家都批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用细菌作战方法的日内瓦议定书”。这是公平合理的办法，是朝鲜人民所欢迎，也是世界人民所希望的。
    细菌战的进行尽管已经激起了全世界爱好和平正义的人民的愤怒，但美国政府和将军们却丝毫也没有悔过的表示。美国政府不仅拒绝了对日内瓦议定书的批准，而且在它所操纵之下的所谓“欧洲防务集团条约”中还明白规定了原子能、化学、细菌武器的生产和作为战争工具而使用。这是对于人类文明的大叛逆。四月初世界和平理事会常务委员会奥斯陆会议所产生的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书是一篇代表全人类的庄严的宣告。常务委员会的决议在理事会的特别会议上重新通过一次，即是把常务委员会的决议扩大成为理事会的决议，这意义是很重大的。这不仅表明了奥斯陆会议决议的正确，而且也表明了“反对细菌战”是全世界人民的共同要求。
    特别会议最后的一个决议“为召开世界人民和平大会的宣言”，是十二月将要召开的世界人民和平大会的先声，也是本次特别会议一切决议的总结。这个简洁而庄严的宣言表明着本次特别会议的成就为世界人民和平大会铺平了道路。
     五、世界人民和平大会的
        前瞻
    “世界人民和平大会”这个新的名称是经过讨论而决定的。
    为什么不用“第三次世界保卫和平大会”而要用这个新的名称呢？一九四九年四月在巴黎、布拉格召开了第一次世界保卫和平大会，一九五○年十一月在华沙召开了第二次，今年十二月在维也纳召开第三次，称为“第三次世界保卫和平大会”，不正保持着历史的传统而名正言顺的吗？
    但经过讨论的结果，大家认为有另立一个新的名目的必要。因为世界的形势改变了，世界人民有了新的要求。今天的世界人民对于和平的关系已经超过了“保卫”的阶段而进到“拯救”的阶段了。宣言结尾的两句话说得很明白而有力量：“和平可以拯救！和平必须拯救！”故“世界人民和平大会”，充足地说时，是“世界人民拯救和平大会”。这或许不免有点危辞悚听吧，但是世界人民在今天是的确感觉着和平遭遇到严重的危机。世界人民希望和平得到拯救，和平理事会的任务就要满足这个希望，号召人民起来拯救，人民有力量拯救在危机中的和平。这在我们中国人民看来，我觉得，是更容易体会的。因为我们的抗美援朝的爱国运动，早就是在“拯救和平”了。
    因此世界人民和平大会是鼓励人民拯救和平的大会，是和平阵营的大检阅，是要人民认识自己的力量，不要为战争狂徒们的“狂燥进行曲”所骇倒，而起来加以制止。
    我们不容许悲观，更不容许旁观。拯救和平是拯救自己，拯救自己的儿女，拯救自己的家庭，不用说也就是拯救人类，拯救人类的文明。悲观是罪过，旁观更是罪恶。
    国际局势的发展使我们不能不想到人民的责任问题。战争挑拨者固然是有责任的，但有力量制止战争的人民，如果不认识自己的力量、纵容战争挑拨者的罪行而不加以制止，同样是有责任的。
    国际局势的发展更使我们不能不想到美国人民的责任问题。美国人民和美国政府美国将军们不用说是有区别的，但大多数的美国人民，一直到今天都还采取着旁观的态度，纵容他们的战争狂徒们而不加以约束，这是世界人民所不能不感觉着遗憾的事。
    奥斯陆会议“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书中，早就对美国人民作出了特别的呼吁了：
    “我们首先向美国的男女呼吁，因为他们每个人的面前都出现了一个正直与否和品格如何的问题。”
    我们中国代表在这次特别会议上，在“朝鲜问题的一般导言”中也对美国人民和美国科学家们作出了特别的呼吁：
    “全世界人民应该一致起来制止这一严重的战争危险，特别是美国人民应有道义上的责任，使全世界人民免于不可想像的残酷的灾祸。
    科学家们，尤其美国的科学家们，应有道义上的责任，要使科学永远为人生服务，把它从成为大量屠杀人类的工具的堕落中救起。”
    在这次特别会议上最受欢迎的苏联大作家爱伦堡的发言，尤其是专门向美国人民说话的。他希望美国人民不要再受美国政府和美国将军们的欺骗宣传所蒙蔽。他明白地告诉美国人民：“为避免战争的危险，人们必须坐在一个桌上来进行谈判。苏联人民愿和任何美国人讲和平，不管他是进步党、共和党还是民主党。它要和美国的工人们讲和平，也要和美国的资本家们讲和平；它不仅要和它的友人讲和平，也要和它的敌人讲和平。它要和平，不是因为它害怕或软弱，而是因为它的心胸广大。”
    是的，我们对于美国人民“有取得协议而找到共同行动方式的能力”具有最大的信心。
    我们所希望的，有如在为召开世界人民和平大会的宣言中所明白指出，是要使“协商精神战胜武力决定”。
    因此，我们可以预想到：世界人民和平大会必将唤起全世界人民拯救和平的责任心，而特别是唤起美国人民的拯救和平的责任心。
    我们并不是要向美国人民兴问罪之师，而是希望美国人民认清楚事实的真相，认清楚自己的力量，和全世界爱好和平的人民一致团结起来，对于战争狂徒们的“世界侵略政策的狂燥进行曲”，及时地加以制止。
    是主动地做拯救世界和平的功臣，还是被动地做人类历史的罪人，是每一个美国人民迅速地自行抉择的时候了。
     六、中国人民的责任
    我们中国人民代表团受到了中国人民的委托，参加了特别会议，助成了各项重要决议的产生，我们中国人民自然有责任支持特别会议的各项决议，而一一促其实现。
    我们中国人民对于德国人民是有充分同情的，对于德国的有警惕性而勇敢的男男女女，他们的争取德国的统一、民主、独立、和平的英勇斗争，我们由衷地表示敬意而乐予支持。我们虽然相隔得辽远一点，我们愿意加强在东方拯救和平的努力来与远在西方的努力相呼应。
    日本问题差不多等于是我们自己的切身问题。我们同样要“对日本人民争取和平、争取独立与民主，反对军国主义和战争的势力的英勇斗争表示敬意”。我们决不能让日本人民孤立，而要对于他们的斗争“给予最大的支持”。
    在朝鲜战场上，我们的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军肩并肩地站在拯救和平的最前线。我们要实践特别会议关于朝鲜停战的决议，最好的办法就是要加强我们的增产节约运动，以支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，粉碎敌人的破坏谈判和扩大战争的阴谋，消灭敌人的细菌战，使朝鲜问题赢得公平合理的和平解决。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经决定在今年秋天在北京召开。我们中国代表团在柏林参加会议的时候，和亚洲及太平洋区域的代表们又有了更进一步的接触。我们有责任要把这个会议开好，要使这个会议对于世界人民和平大会担负着动员的责任。我们要动员亚洲和太平洋区域的人民，尤其是美国人民，来拯救亚洲和太平洋区域的和平与世界的和平。
    杰斐逊的美国，林肯的美国，惠特曼的美国，一定会有不少的像罗伯逊、法斯特那样的拯救和平的勇士。我们欢迎他们排除一切的困难到北京来，共同为动员亚洲和太平洋区域的人民而努力，为动员世界人民而努力。
    人民的力量是无穷无尽的。只要我们动员起来，团结起来，组织起来，我们便可以制止少数战争罪犯们的狂妄企图。
    协商精神一定会战胜武力解决。
