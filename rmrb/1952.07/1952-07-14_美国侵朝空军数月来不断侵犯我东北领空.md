Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 13th: While the American aggressors are delaying and undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, they are also sending large numbers of military aircraft to intrude into our Northeast airspace to carry out provocations. The atrocity of eight U.S. aircraft strafing Andong and killing and wounding 49 of our peaceful people is just one of the recent provocative incidents.

On July 11th, a total of 20 batches of 76 sorties of U.S. military aircraft successively intruded into the airspace over Andong City and Andong, Kuandian, Fengcheng, and Zhuanghe counties in Liaodong Province. Among them, eight U.S. aircraft that intruded into Andong City at 13:57 carried out indiscriminate strafing, causing a serious incident in which 49 of our peaceful residents were killed and wounded.

This incident is the largest atrocity committed by the U.S. Air Force in Korea in recent months, which has continuously bombed and strafed our territory. According to statistics from February 29th to July 10th, U.S. aircraft have intruded into our Northeast airspace a total of 1,662 batches of 7,073 sorties. Some of these U.S. aircraft were engaged in the heinous activity of germ warfare, while others bombed and strafed Andong City and Andong, Linjiang, Ji'an, Kuandian, Fengcheng, and Zhuanghe counties in our Liaodong Province, totaling 39 times, killing and wounding a total of 23 of our peaceful residents, destroying 12 houses, 1 locomotive, 2 carriages, and some other materials and buildings.
