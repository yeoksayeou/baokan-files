(A reader of "Truth Daily" in Gorky City, Bao Baofu, wrote to ask: How is the aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism manifested in the post-war period? "Truth Daily" gave the following answer to this question.)

Lenin, based on a comprehensive analysis of the monopoly stage of capitalism and its laws of development, scientifically proved that imperialism is decadent, dying capitalism, and the eve of the proletarian social revolution.

The First World War, especially the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, laid the foundation for the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

Comrade Stalin, creatively developing Lenin's theory of imperialism, gave a profound exposition of the essence and basic characteristics of the general crisis of capitalism. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the CPSU (B):

"...The imperialist war and its consequences have intensified the corruption of capitalism and disrupted its equilibrium. It shows that the period we are in is a period of wars and revolutions, that is, capitalism is no longer a unique and all-encompassing system of world economy. At present, in addition to the capitalist economic system, there is also a socialist economic system, which is developing day by day and opposes the capitalist system. The very fact of its existence represents the decay of capitalism and shakes its foundations." (Selected Works of Stalin, Northeast Chinese Edition, pp. 167-168).

The crisis of the imperialist colonial system is an integral part of the general crisis of capitalism. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the imperialist war and the victory of the socialist revolution shook the foundations of imperialism in colonies and dependencies; imperialism's prestige in these countries has been swept away, and imperialism no longer has the power to rule there in the old way. Powerful national liberation movements have unfolded in the colonies and dependencies.

The general crisis of capitalism is manifested in the frequent inability of production facilities to operate at full capacity, and the constant presence of millions of unemployed workers.

During the general crisis of capitalism, the contradictions between labor and capital, the contradictions between imperialist countries in the struggle for sources of raw materials and the seizure of other countries' territories, and the contradictions between imperialist countries and colonial countries, are sharpened to an unprecedented degree.

Comrade Stalin taught us that the general crisis of capitalism is a comprehensive crisis of the world capitalist system, which includes both economics and politics. When all the contradictions of bourgeois society are sharpened, the general crisis of capitalism accelerates the demise of capitalism.

(I)

The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia broke a huge gap in the world capitalist system. The October Revolution was a fundamental shift in human history from the old, capitalist world to the new, socialist world.

Comrade Stalin instructed that the First World War and the liberation of our country (the Soviet Union) from the capitalist system laid the foundation for the first stage of the general crisis of capitalism. During the Second World War, especially after the People's Democratic countries in Europe and Asia were liberated from the capitalist system, the general crisis of capitalism entered its second stage.

The characteristics of the new, second stage of the general crisis of the world capitalist system are, first of all, the formation of two opposing camps: the imperialist, anti-democratic camp led by the United States and the unified and powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. On the basis of the development and deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, the changes that have taken place economically in the two opposing camps are: while the capitalist economic system is increasingly disintegrating, the economic strength of the countries in the socialist camp is increasingly developing and consolidating.

The liberation of the European and Asian People's Democratic countries from the imperialist system has brought about a fundamental change in the balance of power on the international stage, a change that is favorable to socialism and unfavorable to capitalism.

Comrade Stalin taught that the main characteristic of the basic economic law of modern capitalism is to obtain high capitalist profits through exploitation, the bankruptcy and impoverishment of one's own people, through the enslavement and consistent plunder of the people of other countries, especially backward countries, and finally through war and the militarization of the national economy to obtain the highest profits.

The socialist camp presents a completely different picture. Internal unity, the commonality of interests in building a new, socialist life, is the source of the ever-increasing strength of the socialist camp. The genuine cooperation of the countries in the socialist camp is based on a sincere desire to help each other to achieve common development, to guarantee the highest speed of their economic development, and to systematically improve the welfare and culture of the workers. The democratic and socialist camp has proved to the world how bright the prospects for economic, scientific and cultural development are for the people who have been liberated from imperialist oppression.

The economic strength of the Soviet Union—the great socialist power—is constantly developing. Comrade Stalin taught us that continuously developing and improving socialist production on the basis of advanced technology in order to ensure a high degree of satisfaction of the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the entire society is the essential characteristic of the basic economic law of socialism.

While capitalist countries are expanding their armaments and militarizing their economies, prices continue to rise, and the absolute and relative poverty of the workers is deepening, the Soviet Union is expanding its civilian industry, undertaking the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations, canals, and irrigation systems, implementing policies to reduce prices, and improving the people's welfare.

The successful completion of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan and the 1951 plan has more than doubled the output of industrial finished products compared with the pre-war year of 1940. The rapid development of the Soviet economy shows that in the past year alone, the output of pig iron increased by 2.7 million tons, steel by about 4 million tons, and rolled steel by 3 million tons. In recent years, the average annual increase in coal production in the Soviet Union has been 24 million tons, and oil by 4.5 million tons. The Soviet Union now produces almost as much steel as the total steel production of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Sweden. The Soviet Union's socialist agriculture is also developing smoothly. In recent years, the total grain harvest has exceeded 7 billion poods per year (one pood equals 32.76 market catties - translator's note).

The industrial and agricultural production of the European People's Democratic countries and the People's Republic of China continues to develop. In the post-war years, the industrial production of the European People's Democratic countries has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. Poland's industrial output in 1951 increased to two and a half times that of 1938, Czechoslovakia (compared to 1937) increased by two-thirds, Hungary increased to two and a half times, Bulgaria (compared to 1939) increased to three and a half times, Romania increased to two times, and Albania increased to 4.3 times.

Contrary to the policies of preparing and provoking world wars pursued by the imperialist countries, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries thoroughly and consistently pursue a policy of peace and friendship among all nations. Soviet foreign policy is based on the premise that the two systems—socialism and capitalism—can coexist peacefully, and firmly implements a policy of maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with all countries that express their willingness to cooperate.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his answers to a group of editors of American newspapers: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible." (People's Daily, April 3, 1952 - translator's note)

Imperialists are afraid of peaceful competition with the socialist system. As the capitalist system is increasingly caught in its irreconcilable contradictions, they want to find a way out in war. While preparing for a new world war, imperialists also attempt to deceive the people with lies, claiming that war is a way to solve the crisis and unemployment. For example, the American bourgeois economist Kenneth Boulding once declared: "The world is now under the oppression of its own terrible choice: either to expand demand through war, or to reduce production through crisis and unemployment."

In fact, this choice imagined by bourgeois thinkers has only one purpose, namely, to justify the bloody imperialist war that brings new, countless profits to millionaires and billionaires.

(II)

The Second World War has made the crisis of the imperialist colonial system unprecedentedly acute. The plunder of the wealth of colonies and dependencies by capitalist monopoly capital, which continues to decline their economies, is a characteristic of the post-war period. Millions of workers in these countries have been impoverished to an unprecedented degree.

The intensification of imperialist oppression has aroused increasingly strong protests from the people enslaved by imperialism, who are unwilling to continue living as before, and are increasingly determined to rise up and fight for their freedom and independence. Comrade Stalin wrote as early as 1927:

"The era of safely exploiting and safely oppressing colonies and dependencies has passed.

The era of national liberation revolutions in colonies and dependencies, the era of the awakening of the proletariat in these countries, the era of the proletariat playing a leading role in the revolution, has arrived." (Complete Works of Stalin, Volume 10, p. 245. Chinese version "Lenin and Stalin on China" p. 333 - translator's note).

The victory of the Soviet Union in the Second World War and the great achievements of socialism have had a great impact on the further development of the national liberation movement. The national liberation struggles of the people of colonies and dependencies are clearly anti-imperialist and anti-feudal in nature. In many countries, the national liberation movement has taken the form of open armed struggle, established people's liberation armies, and produced independent people's democratic countries. The strength, scale and success of the national liberation struggles of the people of various countries against imperialism are primarily a reflection of the growing leading role of the proletariat and its communist vanguard, which unites all patriotic forces around them in a national united front.

The victory of the Chinese national liberation movement and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have great historical significance. After the Great October Revolution, the victory of the Chinese people was a new and most powerful blow to the entire system of world imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has further strengthened the determination of the oppressed people to fight for freedom and independence.

For two years, the heroic Korean people have been waging a just war against American interventionists to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland. The heroic resistance of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers to the American aggressors has aroused the sympathy and spiritual support of progressive humanity.

The Vietnamese people, who have established their own People's Republic, are firmly defending their independence and freedom in the struggle against French and American colonial imperialists. The people of Malaya, Burma and the Philippines are all taking up arms to fight against imperialist enslavers. In India, a democratic united front against imperialism and for national independence is developing and consolidating. The liberation movements in the colonies and dependencies of the Near East, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America are strengthening.

The experience of the national liberation movement clearly shows that the struggle for national independence cannot succeed without establishing a democratic and anti-imperialist united front that unites the working class, the peasantry, the laboring intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie who are willing to be liberated from imperialist oppression.

The more thorough the realization of the leadership of the working class in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, and the more actively the peasantry, the main ally of the proletariat, participates in the struggle, the more powerful the democratic united front.

The national liberation struggles of the oppressed people are increasingly closely united with the class struggles of the proletariat in the metropolitan countries and the movements of the people of all countries for peace. The national liberation movement of the people of colonies and dependencies is a great contribution to the cause of the people of all countries in the struggle for lasting peace.

(III)

The aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism is manifested in the continued deepening of the parasitic nature and decay of the economies of modern capitalist countries. The economic development speed of capitalism has become increasingly slow. In the main country of the imperialist camp—the United States—from 1929 to 1949, the average annual rate of industrial production development did not exceed 2 percent. But during the same period, the average annual rate of industrial production development in the Soviet Union increased by 20 percent.

The natural output of American industrial production in 1950 was lower than the 1945 level, and only exceeded this level in 1951. But from the second half of 1951, a certain tendency of decline in industrial production was seen again. Last year, the American industrial production index in the second half of the year decreased by 2 percent compared to the first half of the year.

The decay of modern capitalism is manifested in the long-term inability of its enterprises to operate at full capacity and the growth of the constant large-scale unemployment phenomenon. Even the materials underreported by official bourgeois statisticians show a large amount of production capacity that cannot be fully utilized in the post-war period. For example, in 1950, unused freight car building capacity in the United States accounted for 70 percent of its production capacity. Machine tool factories in the basic industrial areas of the United Kingdom are only operating at 60-70 percent of their production capacity this year. The phenomenon of large-scale underutilization of capacity is present in the British textile industry and other civilian production departments. Currently, the capacity of Italian enterprises producing machine tools and equipment is only 64 percent operational, and the capacity for producing ships and tractors is only 50 percent operational.

The long-term inability of enterprises to operate at full capacity has led to a further increase in constant large-scale unemployment. According to statistics from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the number of fully and partially unemployed people is: approximately 13 million in the United States, approximately 3 million in France, more than 5.5 million in Italy, approximately 18 million in Japan, and more than 3 million fully unemployed in West Germany.

At the same time, the exploitation of the working class is growing in a shocking manner, and this exploitation savagely consumes the labor power of the workers. The bourgeoisie attempts to obtain the highest profits and strengthen the sweatshop system and the intensification of labor. The increase in accidents in capitalist enterprises is the inevitable consequence of these systems. According to bourgeois newspaper statistics, more than 2 million accidents were registered in American industry in 1951 alone.

The unprecedented development of militarism is the most important sign of the continued decay of modern capitalism and the deepening of the general crisis. Lenin once pointed out that imperialism, by its nature and economic characteristics, is characterized by the greatest and most widespread development of militarism.

Accompanied by the unbridled tyranny of militarism, the expansion of armaments has resulted in a significant reduction in civilian production. Most of the national income is used for military purposes and is distributed in the interests of monopoly capital. Even according to official materials, direct and indirect military expenditures in the United States in the 1951-1952 fiscal year accounted for more than 80 percent of the total national budget.

The militarization of the economy is a source of unprecedented enrichment for monopoly capitalists, who obtain mythical profits from military orders. Last year, the profits obtained by American monopoly capitalists reached the highest level and exceeded the profits during the Second World War.

While the profits of capitalist monopolies are increasing, the conditions of the working masses are constantly deteriorating, exploitation is intensifying, taxes are increasing, and the prices of daily necessities are rising. In the United States alone, from January 1951 to February 1952, the prices of daily necessities increased by more than 22 percent. In the past year, the cost of living index in the United Kingdom rose by 25 percent. In the first half of 1951, the British government announced 62 orders regarding the increase in retail commodity prices.

The sharp decline in the living standards of the workers has further sharpened the contradictions between labor and capital. The working class in capitalist countries, in order to deal with the frantic attacks by monopoly capital on the working people's right to survival, has strengthened the organized struggle against capitalism. The strike movement is developing. In the United States, from January to October 1951, there were 4,065 strike incidents involving 2.02 million workers. In Japan, more than 6 million workers participated in strikes in 1951. In France, there were a total of 2,600 strikes from January to November 1951. The strike struggles of the working class in capitalist countries are growing despite the treacherous and divisive activities of the leaders of the right-wing socialists, who are agents of monopoly capital.

The unprecedented growth of the prestige and influence of the Communist Parties in capitalist countries is entirely in line with the laws of development. The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties are fighting to unite the working class. They stand at the forefront, organizing a counterattack against the attack of monopoly capital on the living interests of the working class, and fighting for the improvement of the economic situation of the laboring masses, and struggling for lasting peace between countries, opposing the criminal plans of the American and British warmongers.

The uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries has been further strengthened in the post-war period. The United States, in terms of the development of its military production, the plunder of other countries, and the destruction of its economy, has gone farther than its competitors.

While engaging in the struggle for world domination, American imperialism is also forming aggressive alliances and implementing the militarization of West Germany and Japan at an accelerated pace.

American monopoly capital is increasingly deeply entrenched in the economies of Britain, France and other capitalist countries, and is striving to turn them into its economic dependencies. American imperialism has seized the sources of raw materials and consumer markets in the colonies of Britain and France. All of this has led to the strengthening of contradictions in the imperialist camp, among which the main contradiction is the contradiction between the United States and Britain. The struggle between Britain and the United States for consumer markets, sources of raw materials, and especially for oil, has taken cruel measures. In the post-war years, American monopoly capitalists have attempted to squeeze Britain out of the oil-producing areas in the Near East and the Middle East and seize the rich oil production of these countries for themselves.

Although British imperialism has been weakened by the war, it continues to maintain its considerable position in the capitalist world, and therefore is unwilling to hand over these interests to American monopoly capitalists without a struggle.

The contradictions in the imperialist camp, which are linked to the cruel struggle for "spheres of influence" to secure sales markets and sources of raw materials, are of an antagonistic nature. These contradictions disrupt the common front of imperialism and cause the imperialist beasts to weaken each other.

(IV)

The deepening of the general crisis of capitalism at the present stage is manifested not only in the economic field, but also in the political, scientific, cultural, and artistic fields.

Faced with the extreme sharpness of capitalist contradictions, the bourgeoisie is desperately seeking a way out of the crisis. In order to preserve its rule, monopoly capital is carrying out a frantic attack on the living rights of the workers, cultivating fascist police methods of management, and intensifying the persecution of the working class organizations and their leaders.

The monopoly capital subjects all state organs to itself, and they use this organ to intensify the exploitation of the workers and the plunder of the people of other countries. Imperialist ideologists Keynes, Clark, Rollwin and others, in their articles, use various false so-called "theories" of the "adjusting" and "planning" role of the bourgeois state to defend monopoly capitalism's manipulation of state organs. In fact, the "adjusting" role of the bourgeois state ultimately serves to ensure that monopoly capitalists obtain high profits.

The bourgeois state is increasingly taking on an openly fascist character. This is especially evident in the United States, which is destroying the last remnants of bourgeois democratic freedoms and intensifying the fascization of domestic political life. The rulers of France, following the orders of their American masters, organized a shameful provocation against the French Communist Party, the true protector of the national interests of the country, and against the mass democratic organizations of the working people.

The right-wing socialists, as direct participants in imperialist gangsterism, actively support the reactionary, anti-people policies of the bourgeoisie in imperialist countries. The right-wing socialists openly embark on the road of selling out the national interests of their own countries, and they support all the aggressive plans of the American warmongers. They are the most vicious enemies of the working class.

The right-wing socialists attempt to undermine the will of the people of all countries to fight for national sovereignty by propagating their harmful cosmopolitanism and to "justify" the ambition of American imperialism to dominate the world. International conferences of all kinds organized by the right-wing socialists are gatherings of a group of spies and provocateurs who advocate the implementation of American imperialism's aggressive plans, the instigation of a new world war, the suppression of all democratic forces, and the fascization of capitalist countries.

Modern bourgeois culture is in a state of complete decline and decay. Bourgeois sociology, political economy, and philosophy try to defend the barbaric exploitation of labor by capital, imperialist aggression, and colonial oppression. Bourgeois newspapers are advocating new wars of cannibalism, praising the "policy of strength" of imperialism and promoting death and destruction. The misanthropic Malthusian "theory" is being revived as an ideological weapon of imperialism. The bourgeois newspapers, radio, and film are unscrupulously propagating a new world war.

Monopoly capital makes science serve the purposes of preparing for war, using scientific achievements to produce tools of destruction and murder. Currently, more than 90 percent of the expenses of the American government on scientific research are spent on military purposes, mainly on the production of atomic weapons and other tools of mass destruction. The bloody American imperialism has committed heinous crimes against humanity by using bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons in Korea.

The policy of plunder, oppression, and violence implemented by the capitalist slave owners has aroused unparalleled anger and resolute resistance from the masses of the people. The workers in capitalist countries are increasingly closely united around the Communist Party, which points them in the only correct direction to oppose capitalist oppression and strive for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism in the post-war period has reaffirmed with new force the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist principles regarding the bankruptcy and historically doomed demise of the capitalist system and the inevitability of the replacement of capitalism by socialist revolution. Historical experience shows that only socialism can liberate the workers from all exploitation, the threat of unemployment, and imperialist wars, and create conditions for continuous economic development and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural standards of the workers.

    论资本主义总危机
    苏联  依·吉洪诺夫作
    （真理报在高尔基城的读者包包夫来信问：战后时期资本主义总危机的尖锐化表现在什么上面？真理报对此问题作了如下的答复。）
    列宁根据对资本主义的垄断阶段及其发展规律性的全面分析，科学地证明了帝国主义是腐朽的，垂死的资本主义，是无产阶级社会革命的前夜。
    第一次世界大战，特别是伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，给世界资本主义体系的总危机奠定了基础。
    斯大林同志创造地发展列宁关于帝国主义的学说时，对资本主义总危机的本质和基本特征作了深刻的阐述。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六次代表大会的报告中指出：
    “……帝国主义大战和它的结果加紧了资本主义的腐化，并破坏了资本主义的平衡，它表明着我们所处的时期，是战争和革命的时期，就是说资本主义已经不是一种世界经济独一无二且包罗一切的制度，现时除资本主义的经济制度外，还有社会主义的经济制度存在，这个社会主义制度，一天天发达起来，与资本主义制度相对立，它的存在这件事实，就是表示资本主义的腐朽，并且动摇它的基础。”（“斯大林选集”东北中文版，第一六七—一六八页——译者）。
    帝国主义殖民体系的危机是资本主义总危机的组成部分。斯大林同志指出，帝国主义的战争和社会主义革命的胜利动摇了帝国主义在殖民地及附属国的基础；帝国主义在这些国家中的威信已经扫地，帝国主义再也没有力量在那里按旧的方式统治下去了。殖民地和附属国展开了强大的民族解放运动。
    资本主义总危机表现在生产机关的经常不能全部开工，经常有成百万的失业工人队伍。
    在资本主义总危机时期，劳动和资本的矛盾，帝国主义国家间在争夺原料来源、强占别国领土斗争上的矛盾及帝国主义国家和殖民地国家间的矛盾，都尖锐到空前未有的程度。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，资本主义总危机是世界资本主义体系的全面危机，这个危机包括了经济也包括了政治。资产阶级社会全部矛盾尖锐化的时候，资本主义总危机加速了资本主义的灭亡。
    （一）
    俄国伟大十月社会主义革命，在世界资本主义体系上打破了一个巨大的缺口。十月革命是人类历史上由旧的，资本主义的世界，走上新的，社会主义世界的根本转变。
    斯大林同志指示说，第一次世界大战和我国（苏联）由资本主义体系中解放出来，为资本主义总危机的第一阶段打下了基础。在第二次世界大战期间，特别是欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家，由资本主义的体系中解放出来以后，资本主义的总危机便进入了第二阶段。
    世界资本主义体系总危机的新的、第二个阶段的特征，首先是两个对立阵营的形成：美国所领导的帝国主义的、反民主的阵营和苏联所领导的、统一的强大的社会主义阵营。在资本主义总危机发展和深入的基础上，两个对立阵营在经济上所发生的变化过程是：在资本主义经济体系日益瓦解的同时，社会主义阵营国家的经济力量却日益发展与巩固。
    欧洲及亚洲人民民主国家从帝国主义体系中解放出来，使国际舞台上的力量对比，发生了根本的变化，这变化是有利于社会主义，而不利于资本主义的。
    斯大林同志教导说，现代资本主义的基本经济规律的主要特征是通过剥削获取高度的资本主义的利润，本国人民的破产和穷困，通过对其他国家，尤其是落后国家人民的奴役和一贯的掠夺，最后通过战争和国民经济的军国主义化来获得最高的利润。
    社会主义阵营完全是另一幅情景。内部的统一，建设新的、社会主义生活的利益的共同性，是社会主义阵营力量不断增长的源泉。社会主义阵营国家的真正合作，是基于互相帮助以达到共同发展的忠诚愿望，保证它们经济发展的最高速度，来有系统地提高劳动者的福利和文化。民主和社会主义阵营向全世界证明，由帝国主义压迫下解放出来的人民面前，开辟了经济、科学和文化发展的如何美好的远景。
    苏联—伟大社会主义的强国——的经济力量不断地在发展。斯大林同志教导我们，通过在高度技术的基础上不断的发展与改进社会主义的生产，以保证高度满足全社会经常增加的物质和文化的需要，是社会主义基本经济规律的本质的特征。
    当资本主义国家进行军备扩张和经济军国主义化，物价继续上涨，劳动者绝对的与相对的穷困加深的时候，苏联却扩大民用工业，展开巨大的水电站、运河与灌溉系统的建设，实行减低物价政策，提高人民的福利。
    战后斯大林五年计划和一九五一年计划的顺利完成，使工业成品产量比较战前一九四○年增加了一倍多。苏联经济的迅速发展说明，仅在去年鎔铁增加了二百七十万吨，钢增加了约四百万吨，辗铁增加了三百万吨。最近数年，苏联每年产煤平均增加二千四百万吨，石油增加了四百五十万吨。苏联现在钢的产量，差不多和英国，法国，比利时与瑞典产钢量的总数相同。苏联的社会主义的农业，也顺利地发展着。在最近几年，粮食的总收成量每年都超过七十亿普特（一普特合三二·七六市斤——译注）。
    欧洲人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的工业生产与农业生产都在继续发展。战后年代中，欧洲人民民主国家的工业生产都大大地超过了战前的水平。波兰一九五一年的工业成品产量，比较一九三八年增加到两倍半，捷克斯洛伐克（比较一九三七年）增加了三分之二，匈牙利增加到两倍半，保加利亚（比较一九三九年）增加到三倍半，罗马尼亚增加到两倍，阿尔巴尼亚增加到四·三倍。
    与帝国主义国家所执行的准备与挑拨世界大战的政策相反，苏联与人民民主国家彻底地和一贯地执行着和平与各民族友好的政策。苏联的外交政策是以两个体系—社会主义与资本主义—可以和平共存为出发，并坚决地执行着与一切表示愿意合作的国家维持友好和平的政策。
    斯大林同志在其答美国报纸一群编辑问时指出：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”（一九五二年四月三日“人民日报”——译者）
    帝国主义者害怕与社会主义体系和平竞赛。资本主义的体系日益陷入其不可解决的矛盾之中，他们想在战争中寻找出路。帝国主义者在进行新的世界大战的准备，同时又企图以说谎来欺骗人民，他们把战争说成解救危机与失业的方法。例如，美国资产阶级的经济学家坎尼特·鲍尔丁曾宣称：“世界现正处在它自己造成的可怕的选择的压迫之下：或者以战争方式扩大需要，或者以危机与失业来减缩生产”。
    事实上，资产阶级思想家幻想出来这个选择只有一个目的，即是来替给百万和亿万富翁带来新的，无数利润的血腥帝国主义战争作辩护。
    （二）
    第二次世界大战使帝国主义的殖民地制度的危机空前地尖锐起来了。资本主义垄断资本掠夺殖民地及附属国的财富，使这些国家的经济继续衰落，是战后时期的特点。这些国家的千百万劳动者已经穷困到无以复加的程度。
    帝国主义压迫的加紧，引起了受帝国主义奴役的人民的愈来愈强烈的抗议，这些人民不愿意继续照旧过下去，并且愈益坚决地起来为自己的自由与独立而斗争了。斯大林同志尚在一九二七年时就写道：
    “安然剥削和安然压迫殖民地和附属国的时代，已经过去了。
    殖民地和附属国里民族解放革命的时代，这些国家中无产阶级觉醒的时代，无产阶级在革命中起领导作用的时代，已经到来了。”（“斯大林全集”第十卷，第二四五页。中文版“列宁斯大林论中国”第三三三页——译者）。
    苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利，社会主义的伟大成就，对民族解放运动进一步地展开有很大的影响。殖民地与附属国人民的民族解放斗争，鲜明地带着反帝反封建的性质。民族解放运动在许多国家中采取了公开武装斗争的形式，建立了人民解放军，产生了独立的人民民主国家。各国人民反对帝国主义的民族解放斗争的力量、规模与成功，首先说明了无产阶级及其共产主义的先锋队的增长着的领导作用，他们在民族统一战线中把所有爱国力量都团结在自己的周围。
    中国民族解放运动的胜利及中华人民共和国的成立有伟大的历史意义。在伟大十月革命之后，中国人民的胜利是对世界帝国主义整个体系的新的，最有力的打击。中国人民革命的胜利更加坚定了被压迫人民为争取自由与独立而斗争的决心。
    两年来英勇的朝鲜人民为了保卫自己祖国的自由与独立，正在进行着反对美国干涉者的正义战争。朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军给美国侵略者的英勇抵抗，引起了进步人类的同情与精神支援。
    建立自己的人民共和国的越南人民，在反对法国与美国殖民帝国主义者的斗争中，坚强地捍卫着自己的独立与自由。马来亚，缅甸，菲律宾的人民都拿着武器，为反对帝国主义奴役者而斗争着。在印度，反对帝国主义争取民族独立的民主统一战线正在发展着和巩固着。近东，中东，菲洲，拉丁美洲的殖民地与附属国的解放运动正在增强。
    民族解放运动的经验明显地表示出，争取民族独立的斗争，如果不建立团结工人阶级，农民，劳动知识分子与愿从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的民族资产阶级的民主反帝统一战线是不能成功的。
    反帝反封建革命中，工人阶级领导权实现愈彻底，无产阶级主要同盟者的农民参加斗争愈积极，则民主统一战线愈有力量。
    被压迫人民的民族解放斗争与宗主国无产阶级的阶级斗争和各国人民争取和平的运动日益紧密地联合起来了。殖民地与附属国人民的民族解放运动，对各国人民间争取持久和平而斗争的事业是一个伟大的贡献。
    （三）
    资本主义总危机的尖锐化，表现在现代资本主义国家经济的寄生性与腐朽的继续加深上。资本主义的经济发展速度愈益缓慢了。在帝国主义阵营的主要国家—美国—从一九二九年到一九四九年，工业生产发展的每年平均速度没有超过百分之二。但在同一时期苏联的工业生产发展的每年平均速度却增加了百分之二十。
    一九五○年美国工业生产的自然产额，比较一九四五年水平要低，仅在一九五一年才超过了这个水平。但是从一九五一年下半年，又看到工业生产下降的某种倾向。去年下半年美国工业生产指数，比较上半年下降百分之二。
    现代资本主义的腐朽，表现在其企业长期性不能全部开工和经常大量失业现象的增长。甚至于被官方的资产阶级统计学家所少报了的材料，都说明战后生产机关大量的不能全部开工。例如，一九五○年美国未全部开工的火车车箱建造企业，占其生产力量的百分之七十。英国国内基本工业区的母机制造厂，在今年仅有这些工厂生产力量的百分之六十—七十开着工。大量的不能全部开工的现象，在英国纺织工业中，以及其他民用生产部门都有。现在意大利生产机床及设备的企业的力量，仅有百分之六十四开着工，生产轮船及拖拉机的力量，仅有百分之五十开着工。
    各企业长期性的不能全部开工，使经常的大量失业更为增加。据世界工联的统计，完全失业和部分失业的人数：在美国约一千三百万人，在法国约三百万人，在意大利有五百五十万人以上，在日本约一千八百万人，在西德完全失业的在三百万人以上。
    同时对工人阶级的剥削骇人听闻地在增长着，这种剥削野蛮地消耗着工人的劳动力。资产阶级企图获得最高的利润，加强血汗制度和劳动的紧张化。资本主义企业中不幸事故的增加，便是这些制度的不可避免的后果。据资产阶级报纸的统计，仅在一九五一年美国工业中登记了二百万起以上的不幸事故。
    军国主义的空前发展，是现代资本主义继续腐朽和总危机深刻化的最重要的标志。列宁曾指示过，帝国主义以其本质和经济性质来说，是以黩武主义的最大的和普遍的发展为特点的。
    伴随着军国主义的横行无忌，军备扩张而来的是民用生产的显著减低。国家收入的大部都用在军事目的上，是为了垄断资本的利益而分配的。甚至根据官方的材料，美国一九五一——一九五二年预算年度的直接和间接的军费支出占国家全部预算的百分之八十以上。
    经济的军国主义化是垄断资本家空前致富的源泉，他们从军事定货中得到神话似的利润。去年美国垄断资本家所得的利润达到了最高的水平，并且超过了它在第二次世界大战年代中的利润。
    当资本主义垄断利润增加的时候，是劳动者群众的状况正在不断恶化，剥削正在加紧，捐税正在增加，日用品价格正在上升的时候。美国仅自一九五一年一月到一九五二年二月，日用品价格上涨了百分之二十二以上。过去一年中，英国的生活指数上涨了百分之二十五。一九五一年上半年，英国政府公布了六十二起关于提高零售商品价格的命令。
    劳动者生活水平的急剧下降，使劳动与资本间的矛盾更形尖锐化。资本主义国家的工人阶级，为了对付垄断资本对劳动者生存权利的疯狂进攻起见，加强了反对资本主义的有组织的斗争。罢工运动正在发展着。在美国从一九五一年一月到十月发生过包括二百零二万工人的四千零六十五起罢工事件。在日本一九五一年参加罢工的劳动者在六百万人以上。在法国自一九五一年一月到十一月共有二千六百次罢工。资本主义国家的工人阶级罢工斗争，不顾右派社会主义者头目——垄断资本的代理人的叛卖分裂活动而增长着。
    资本主义国家内共产党的威信与影响的空前增长是完全合乎规律的。共产党与工人党是为争取工人阶级团结而斗争的。他们以先锋队的姿态挺身为争取各国间的持久和平，反对美英战争贩子们的罪恶计划，组织对垄断资本向工人阶级生活利益进攻的反击，并为劳动群众的经济情况好转而斗争着。
    资本主义国家经济与政治发展的不平衡，在战后时期更为加强了。美国在其军事生产的发展，对别国的掠夺并对其经济的破坏上来说，是比较它的竞争者要走得远些。
    美帝国主义在进行争夺世界统治权的同时，又在结成侵略同盟，并以加快的速度实行着西德与日本的军国主义化。
    美国垄断资本愈益深入地盘据在英法及其他资本主义国家的经济之中，并竭力将它们变为自己的经济附属品。美帝国主义强夺了英法的殖民地的原料来源及消费市场。这都引起帝国主义阵营中矛盾的加强，其中主要的矛盾是美国与英国的矛盾。英美对争夺消费市场，原料来源，特别是对争夺石油的斗争采取了残酷的手段。战后年代，美国垄断资本家企图把英国从近东及中东国家的产油区域中排挤出去，并将这些国家的丰富油产拿到自己的手里。
    英帝国主义虽然被战争削弱了，但它在资本主义世界里还继续保有其相当的地位，因此不愿意不经过斗争，就将这些利益拱手让给美国垄断资本家。
    与争夺保证销售市场与原料来源的“势力范围”的残酷斗争相联系的，帝国主义阵营中的矛盾，是具有敌对的性质。这些矛盾破坏了帝国主义的共同战线，并使帝国主义野兽们互相削弱了自己。

    现阶段资本主义总危机的深刻化，不但表现在经济上，而且也表现在政治，科学，文化，艺术等方面。
    站在资本主义矛盾极端尖锐面前的资产阶级，拼命寻求摆脱危机的出路。垄断资本为了保全其统治起见，对劳动者的生活权利进行着疯狂的进攻，培植法西斯警察方式的管理，加紧对工人阶级的组织及其领袖的迫害。
    使全部国家机关服从于自己的垄断资本，他们利用这个机关来加紧对劳动者的剥削和掠夺其他国家的人民。帝国主义的思想家凯因斯、克拉尔克、罗尔温及其他等人，在其文章里以各种虚伪的所谓资产阶级国家的“调整的”与“计划的”作用的“理论”来为垄断资本主义操纵国家机关作辩护。事实上，资产阶级国家的“调整的”作用，终归是为了保证垄断资本家获得高度利润。
    资产阶级的国家愈益采取了公开的法西斯性质。特别明显地是在美国，摧毁着资产阶级民主的自由的最后残余，加强内政生活的法西斯化。法国的执政者按照其美国主子的命令，组织了对国家民族利益的真正保护者的法国共产党、对劳动者群众性的民主组织的可耻的挑衅。
    做为帝国主义强盗行为的直接参加者的右派社会主义者，积极地支持着帝国主义国家资产阶级的反动的，反人民的政策。右派社会主义者公开地走上出卖本国民族利益的道路，他们支持美国战争贩子们的一切侵略计划。他们是工人阶级最凶恶的敌人。
    右派社会主义者企图以其有害的世界主义的宣传来破坏各国人民为争取民族主权而斗争的意志，为美帝国主义统治世界的野心来“论证”。右派社会主义者所组织的一切性质的国际会议，都是一群间谍与挑拨者的集会，这些家伙是主张实现美帝国主义的侵略计划，挑起新的世界大战，镇压一切民主力量和把资本主义国家法西斯化的。
    现代资产阶级的文化，是处于完全衰落和腐朽的状况。资产阶级的社会学、政治经济学、哲学设法为资本对劳动的野蛮剥削，帝国主义的侵略与殖民地的压迫来辩护。资产阶级的报纸，正在鼓吹着吃人的新战争，赞扬帝国主义的“强力政策”和宣传死亡与毁灭。重新又把仇视人类的马尔萨斯“理论”搬出来，来做为帝国主义思想的武器。资产阶级的报纸，广播，电影肆无忌惮地进行着新的世界大战的宣传。
    垄断资本使科学来为准备战争的目的而服务，利用科学成就来生产破坏与杀人的工具。现在美国政府在科学研究工作上百分之九十以上的费用，是化费在军事目的上，主要地是生产原子武器与其他大量杀伤的工具。血腥的美帝国主义在朝鲜使用细菌武器及化学武器犯了反对人类的滔天罪行。
    资本主义奴隶主们所实行的掠夺、压迫与暴力的政策，引起了人民群众的无比愤怒与坚决的反抗。资本主义国家的劳动者日益紧密地团结在给他们指出反对资本主义压迫，争取和平、民主与社会主义的唯一正确道路的共产党的周围。
    战后时期，资本主义总危机的尖锐化，以新的力量证实了马克思列宁主义关于资本主义制度的破产与历史注定的灭亡，关于以社会主义革命代替资本主义的必然性的原理的正确。历史经验表示出，只有社会主义才能使劳动者由一切剥削，失业威胁，帝国主义战争中解放出来，并创造经济不断发展，劳动者物质与文化水平不断提高的条件。
