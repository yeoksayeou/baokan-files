The national summer agricultural tax collection work has fully commenced.

Based on the considerable wheat harvest nationwide, the summer tax collection work in regions such as Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, western Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan officially began in early July. Some areas with earlier harvests have already delivered grain to warehouses.

The characteristics of this year's summer tax collection work are: leadership attaches importance, organization is strengthened, the guiding principle is clear, and business operations are improved. Therefore, this year's summer tax collection will become a more organized and more enthusiastic patriotic grain delivery campaign.

Regarding organizational leadership: Most people's governments and financial departments at all levels have achieved leadership responsibility by the top leaders themselves, and have strengthened work inspection. In addition to the central government sending two inspection teams to Henan and northern Anhui, the East China Financial Department sent nine inspection teams to Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and Anhui, while North China sent three inspection teams to Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi. Shandong Province sent more than 120 people, Pingyuan Province sent 218 people, and Hebei Province sent 68 people to their respective regions to supervise and inspect the summer tax collection work. Most provinces have made appropriate arrangements for summer tax collection, drought resistance, summer planting, and other tasks. For example, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, under the leadership of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, organized "Collection and Purchase Committees" or "Joint Offices," placing the four major tasks of collection, purchase, recovery of loans, and delivery of industrial products to the countryside under a unified leadership organization, thereby improving work efficiency. In addition, the cooperation of governments at all levels and the convening of representative conferences from all walks of life provided extensive policy education to the masses, raising their awareness. Yang Yuyin, a farmer representative from the first district of Huojia County, Pingyuan Province, said at the representative conference: "When I came, I thought that increased production this year would also increase the burden. After listening to the report, I realized that the government does not increase the burden simply because of increased production."

All localities have uniformly emphasized the State Council's policy of "implementing land surveying and production determination, calculating taxes according to rates, legally reducing and exempting, gradually realizing unified progressive rates, and abolishing all surcharges." Shandong and other provinces have clearly stipulated that the calculation of summer tax amounts should be based on the proportion of summer production to the annual expected output. Some provinces, such as Pingyuan and Hebei, have combined this with the bumper harvest appraisal movement to verify wheat field yields in order to accurately calculate the summer tax amounts.

In terms of improving collection operations, most provinces have fully implemented "delivery contracts" between grain deliverers and grain receivers. The collection and employment transportation methods that were effectively piloted in Pingyuan last year have also begun to be tested in key areas of Shandong and other provinces this year. The grain delivered in various localities generally meets the standards of "dry, clean, and full." Hebei, Henan, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and other provinces have concentrated on compiling collection registers at the county (or district) level, directly calculating and determining the tax amounts for each household. The organizational nature and work efficiency of this year's summer tax collection operations have been greatly improved compared to last year.

However, there are still two problems with this year's summer tax collection: First, in some areas, there is a tendency towards "calculating taxes according to rates for the whole year, and contracting tasks for the summer," which only "calculates taxes according to rates" for the total annual tax amount, but does not make specific provisions according to the State Council's instructions regarding how much should be paid in summer and how much should be paid in autumn, or has provisions that are inappropriate, leading to a bias towards "heavy summer and light autumn" or "light summer and heavy autumn." According to reports: in individual counties and districts, summer production accounts for 34% of the annual output, but the summer "task" assigned reaches 70% of the annual tax calculated according to rates. There are also individual districts and townships where summer tax collection exceeds the annual tax calculated according to rates. These biases should be quickly corrected in accordance with the State Council's instructions on agricultural tax revenue work in 1952 and the Central Ministry of Finance's answer on "how should summer tax amounts be calculated" (see the second edition of this newspaper on June 27th) in order to realize the principle of "calculating taxes according to rates and balancing summer and autumn." Second, some cadres in counties, districts, and townships still have the mindset of fearing "Three-Anti" and waiting for "Three-Anti," and are not active enough in summer tax collection work; some cadres in bumper harvest areas are blindly optimistic and complacent upon seeing this year's good wheat harvest; individual cadres in areas with poor harvests have a lack of confidence, fear trouble, and have thoughts of waiting. These all require attention, explanation, and correction.

### 全国农业税夏征工作全面展开

    全国农业税夏征工作全面展开
    在全国小麦相当丰收的基础上，河北、平原、山西、山东、苏北、皖北、河南、陕西、川西、川东、川南等地区的夏征工作业于七月初全面开始。部分收获较早地区，已送粮入库。
    今年夏征工作的特点是：领导重视，组织加强，方针明确，业务提高。因之，今年的夏征将成为一个更有组织的更热烈的爱国主义交粮运动。
    关于组织领导方面：各级人民政府及财政部门大部分作到首长负责，亲自领导，并加强了工作的检查。除中央派两个考察组分赴河南、皖北检查外，华东财政部派出九个检查组分赴山东、苏北和安徽，华北派出三个检查组分赴河北、平原、山西，山东省派出一百二十余人、平原省派出二百十八人、河北省派出六十八人分赴所属各专区，督促及检查夏征工作。大部省份对夏征和抗旱、夏种及其他工作，均作了适当的安排。如平原、山西、河北等省在省财政经济委员会领导下，组织了“征收收购委员会”或“联合办公室”，把征收、收购、收回贷款和工业品下乡四大工作放在一个统一领导组织之下，因而工作效率提高，加以各级政府的配合，和各界代表会的召开，向群众作了广泛的政策教育，提高了群众的认识。平原省获嘉县一区的农民代表杨玉印在代表会议上说：“来时认为今年增产了负担也会增加，听了报告以后，才知道政府不是根据增产多就要多负担的。”
    各地一致强调了政务院规定的“贯彻查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，逐步实现统一累进，并取消一切附加”的方针。山东等省明确规定夏征税额的计算，以夏季产量所占全年应产量的比例为标准；某些省份，如平原及河北，结合了丰产评比运动，核实麦田产量，以便正确计算夏征税额。
    在改进征收业务方面，大部省份已全面推行交粮者与收粮者的“交接合同”，去年平原试行有效的征雇运输办法，今年山东等省亦已开始重点试验。各地所交粮食大都合乎“干、净、饱满”的标准。河北、河南及山东、苏北等省均集中在县（或区）编造征收清册，直接计算和确定各户税额。今年夏征业务的组织性与工作效率，已比去年大大提高。
    但是，今年的夏征还存在着两个问题：首先是某些地区存在着“全年依率计征，夏季任务包干”的偏向，只是对全年税额“依率计征”，但在全年总税额中夏季应纳多少，秋季应纳多少，则没有按政务院的指示作出具体规定，或有规定而不恰当，以致发生“夏重秋轻”或“夏轻秋重”偏向。据反映：个别县、区夏季产量占全年产量百分之三十四，而所派夏征“任务”却达全年依率计征额百分之七十，还有个别区、乡有夏征超过全年依率计征额的。这些偏向应当按照政务院关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示及中央财政部关于“夏征税额应当怎样计算”的解答（见六月二十七日本报第二版）速予纠正，以实现“依率计征，夏秋平衡”的原则。其次是有些县、区、乡的干部仍存在着怕“三反”和等“三反”的思想，对夏征工作不够积极；有些丰收地区的干部见到今年小麦丰收，盲目乐观，麻痹大意；个别歉收区的干部则有信心不足，怕麻烦和等待等思想。这都是应当注意加以解释和改正的。
