State-owned trading companies at all levels in Yunnan Province have cultivated a large number of ethnic minority trade cadres. Currently, there are 421 cadres from over twenty ethnic groups, including Yi, Miao, Yao, Dai, Nu, Kawa, Aka, Lisu, and Mosuo, working in trade organizations at all levels. Among them, seven have been promoted to managers of trade branch companies, and many others serve as section chiefs, division chiefs, or trade team leaders. In the Lijiang District, ethnic minority cadres account for 61% of the trade cadres.

With the vigorous training provided by state-owned trading companies and the specific assistance of Han cadres, ethnic minority cadres have made rapid progress. Most of them are activists from among the masses, and some have also participated in ethnic minority training classes in various localities and at the Yunnan Nationalities Institute. They are all willing to accept help from Han cadres and quickly learn the business. Last year, the Eshan Yi Autonomous Region Trade Branch Company recruited four Yi cadres, and the leaders specifically assigned Han cadres to help them learn. After nearly a month of study and practical work in Yi areas, all four Yi cadres are now able to work independently, and Fang Binglin has even become the trade team leader of the Fulangpeng District. Many ethnic minority cadres have learned more complex accounting work.

In trade work, ethnic minority cadres have promoted the excellent style of being hardworking, simple, and closely connected with the masses. Dao Yongguang, a Dai cadre from the Xinping County Branch Company, carries out trade work in the Gasa Dai gathering area. Despite the hot weather, he often carries goods back and forth over a hundred li of mountainous area to sell grain and general merchandise, and in the evening, he also has to settle accounts and keep records. Dao Huarong, a Dai cadre from the Fohai Branch Company, went to the mountainous areas to purchase cotton and supply salt, which was warmly welcomed and trusted by the Aka people, and the transaction volume greatly increased. They also frequently reflect the demands of their ethnic groups and actively offer opinions to the leadership to improve work. In the past, the development of trade work was limited due to historical barriers and language barriers; now, with the increase in the number of ethnic minority cadres, trade work in ethnic minority areas has been advanced a step further.

    云南省各级国营贸易公司
    培养出大量的少数民族干部
    云南省各级国营贸易公司已培养出大量的少数民族贸易干部。目前在各级贸易机构工作的彝、苗、瑶、傣、怒、佧佤、阿佧、倮?、摩些等二十多种民族的干部已有四百二十一人。其中，已有七人提升为贸易支公司经理，还有许多担任科长、股长或贸易小组长。丽江专区的贸易干部中，少数民族干部占百分之六十一。
    在国营贸易公司大量培养与汉族干部具体帮助下，少数民族干部进步很快。他们多数是群众中的积极分子，有的还参加过各地少数民族训练班和云南民族学院学习。他们都乐意接受汉族干部的帮助，很快地学会了业务。峨山县彝族自治区贸易支公司去年吸收了四个彝族干部，领导人专门指定汉族干部帮助他们学习。经过将近一月的学习，和到彝族地区去实地工作，现在，四个彝族干部都能独立工作，其中方炳麟还担任了富良棚区贸易小组长。许多少数民族干部，已学会了较复杂的会计工作。
    少数民族干部在贸易工作中，发扬了坚苦朴实与密切联系群众的优良作风。新平县支公司的傣族干部刀永光，在戛洒傣族聚区开展贸易工作，虽在炎热的天气，也经常挑着担子往来一百多里的山区出售粮食、百货，晚上还要结账记账。佛海支公司傣族干部刀华荣到山区收购棉花，供销食盐，受到阿佧族人民的热烈欢迎与信任，交易额大大增加。他们还经常反映本族人民的要求，积极向领导上提意见改进工作。过去由于历史隔阂及语言不通，贸易工作的开展受到限制；现在随着少数民族干部的增加，已将少数民族地区的贸易工作向前推进了一步。（新华社）
