Cooperatives and New Farm Tools
By Our Reporter Tian Liu

Cooperatives equipped with new farm tools are like birds growing wings,
Flying higher and higher, farther and farther. – New folk saying.

The wheat fields of the Bao'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jixian County, Songjiang Province, are located on both sides of the highway from Jixian to Fujin. Passersby often stop here, admiring the luxuriant wheat fields and saying, "Look at their wheat, growing so uniformly and strong. Our wheat is tall and short, like three generations of different ages." Agricultural technicians from the provincial capital conducted a careful field investigation of the "growth status" here and predicted, "This wheat can yield 6,000 jin per hectare."

The Bao'an Agricultural Production Cooperative was established last winter, with a total of sixteen peasant households cultivating ninety-eight hectares of land.

In summer, the sun rises especially early in northern Manchuria. By two o'clock in the morning, the grassland is already golden. The members of the Bao'an Cooperative rise even earlier than the sun. While cool dewdrops still shimmer on the plump wheat ears, they are already working in the fields. At night, while other farmers sit in the square enjoying the cool air and chatting, the members of the cooperative are studying and reading newspapers in their night school. The cooperative is like a harmonious family. Everyone works together with one heart and one mind, and everything is done in an orderly manner.

One day, the members of the Bao'an Cooperative were weeding in their luxuriant wheat fields, each wearing a brand-new blue twill cotton garment. A member named Xie Huaixiang said, "This was a gift from the chairman of the cooperative." He pointed to a tall farmer who was hoeing ahead:

"He led our mutual aid team to use new farm tools last year, which increased the production of the whole team by more than 30%. Our team became a first-class model team in the province. Our team leader was rated as a special-class model cadre in the province. The province awarded our team a comprehensive shovel-tiller and awarded the chairman a bolt of twill cotton. He said the credit belonged to everyone and insisted on dividing the cloth among us to make a blue cotton garment for each person."

The chairman of the Bao'an Cooperative is Xu Liansheng. He used to be a farmhand, enduring all kinds of hardships and learning excellent farming skills. He could handle everything from plowing and planting to hoeing and harrowing, driving carts and feeding horses. After liberation, he was allocated two hectares of land. This was the first time in his life that he had farmed his own land, and his enthusiasm was beyond words. Xu Liansheng fully understood where his happiness came from, so he was sincerely grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government. He always took the lead in responding to the various calls of the Party and the government. In 1949, the government called on farmers to go into the mountains to cut timber. At that time, the awareness of many farmers was not as high as it is now, and they were unwilling to go to those steep mountains to cut timber. Xu Liansheng harnessed his own cart and horses and said to everyone, "Without the Communist Party, would we have been able to divide the land and have carts? Now the country needs timber for construction. Even if the country didn't pay us, we should still go!" The farmers listened to him and followed him into the mountains. That year, because Xu Liansheng led well, neither the people nor the horses suffered from the cold, and each cart and horse team earned three to four million yuan in wages. The farmers supported him from the bottom of their hearts and elected him as the village chief after returning home. Over the years, he has led farmers to organize mutual aid teams and use new farm tools, and now he is leading everyone to establish cooperatives.

The members talked about their new farm tools and the relationship between the new farm tools and the cooperative, and their enthusiasm grew even higher.

They said that new farm tools are really good things. The first time they used them last year, they harvested 480 jin more wheat per hectare and 380 jin more soybeans per hectare. As a result, every family in the team improved their living standards, bought seven large horses, and three households replaced weak horses with strong ones. But new problems also arose: the efficiency of the new farm tools was too high to be fully utilized on the small plots of land in the mutual aid team. "Last year, I used new farm tools to plant wheat. One day, there were still four ridges left in a piece of land I had planted in the morning," said team member Zhang Fengshan. "In the afternoon, I had to go there again just for these four ridges. The seeder has ten seeders, and to plant these four ridges, I had to block six of them. How inconvenient is that!" Everyone also talked about Wang Lianfu and Lin Jishan: their land was next to each other; Wang Lianfu wanted to plant half wheat and half millet on his land, and Lin Jishan, fearing that others would occupy his land border, wanted to plant six ridges of millet on the edge of his land; this divided a piece of land into four small pieces, and the large piece of land could not play the role of large-scale cultivation.

Last autumn, when everyone was troubled by this problem, the Party and the People's Government sent cadres to the village to help organize cooperatives. Xu Liansheng and his team members, after hearing about how the cooperative distributes profits, how it organizes labor, and how it further utilizes the role of new farm tools, were all willing to establish a cooperative immediately. Those who had not used new farm tools last year had already regretted it very much because they had not followed Xu Liansheng in using new farm tools last year. Now, seeing that Xu Liansheng was taking the lead in organizing the cooperative, they knew that the cooperative must be good, and everyone rushed to join. Xu Liansheng said to everyone, "This is the first year, let's be steady and do it well, and then everyone can join the cooperative next year." The villagers thought it made sense, so they based the cooperative on Xu Liansheng's mutual aid team and absorbed five more households, establishing a cooperative including sixteen households. The others formed two large perennial mutual aid teams and also borrowed two sets of new farm tools. From then on, Bao'an Village, with its forty-three households, was completely organized. Both the cooperative and the mutual aid teams used new farm tools to cultivate the land. Now, the two mutual aid teams are watching the cooperative in everything, and everyone in the village is looking at Xu Liansheng.

"It's still us people, it's still our set of new farm tools," said Xu Liansheng, who had been listening to others talk all along, "but after forming the cooperative, everything is different."

Xu Liansheng compared the changes before and after the establishment of the cooperative in detail.

The land of the cooperative is connected into pieces, and unified management is implemented: according to the nature of the land and the ridge openings, whatever should be planted is planted. The highly efficient new farm tools can then better display their abilities. The machine running empty, and the land being divided into small pieces because each household planted different crops, as happened last year, no longer exists. The efficiency of the seeder has increased by 34% compared to last year. Due to the implementation of unified management, the land is beginning to be used to its full potential. This year, the planned unit area yield per hectare is 654 jin higher than last year. Looking at the current growth of the crops, this goal will only be exceeded, and will never be unreachable.

In the cooperative, not only is the land used to its full potential and the materials used to their full extent, but also the people are used to their full abilities. The members can exert their abilities as much as possible. Meng Xianwen used to be a farmhand, and he was proficient in all kinds of field work, so everyone elected him as the leader of the cooperative's agricultural production team. Xie Huaimeng is strong and works quickly and well; but he is not good at planning. The cooperative asked him to be the leader of the cultivation team. This kind of work does not require him to make his own plans, as long as he follows the plans made by the cooperative and works hard. This gives play to his strengths and makes up for his shortcomings.

Because the land is used to its full potential, the materials are used to their full extent, and the people are used to their full abilities, the area of cultivated land borne by each laborer in the Bao'an Cooperative has increased from 4.4 hectares last year to 8 hectares, but this year's cultivation is still more meticulous than it was in the mutual aid team last year. 82% of the cultivated land has been fertilized, which is a big deal in the northern Manchurian grasslands, where there has never been a habit of fertilizing. The wheat in the cooperative has all been selected from superior varieties, and all have been treated with warm water soaking and copper sulfate disinfection. The soybeans are all good seeds of "Man Cang Jin", and the roots have been inoculated with rhizobia when planting. On the northeast side of Bao'an Village, there is a tall farm tool warehouse. Xu Liansheng, chairman of the cooperative, said, "This was built during planting season. The area of cultivated land borne by the labor force is almost twice as much as last year. Because new farm tools are more handy and labor efficiency has been improved, there is extra labor force instead." This spring, they not only freed up manpower to build this large warehouse, but also allocated two people and six horses for transportation, earning more than 2 million yuan.

New farm tools have increased land yields and promoted farmers to further organize and gradually move towards cooperation; cooperatives have created a new world for new farm tools to fully exert their effectiveness. No wonder the farmers say: Cooperatives equipped with new farm tools are like birds growing wings, flying higher and higher, farther and farther. Cooperatives fly to collective farms, and new farm tools fly to agricultural mechanization.

    合作社和新农具
    本报记者  田流
    合作社配上新农具，就像小鸟长上翅膀，
    越飞越高，越飞越远。——新农谚。
    松江省集贤县的保安农业生产合作社的麦田，在集贤到富锦的公路的两旁。行人走到这里，常常停下脚来，对着那繁茂的麦田赞羡着说：“看人家这麦子，齐刷刷地长的多强，咱那麦子，高的高矮的矮，简直是老少三辈。”从省城来的农业技术员，在这里仔细地进行了“生育状况”的田间调查，预告说：“这麦子，一公顷能收六千斤。”
    保安农业生产合作社是在去年冬天建立起来的，共有十六户农民，耕种着九十八公顷土地。
    夏天，北满的太阳来得特别早，早晨两点多钟，草原上已是一片金黄了。保安合作社的社员们比太阳还起的早，肥大的麦穗上还闪烁着清凉的露珠时，他们早已在田间劳动了。夜晚，农民们坐在广场上乘凉谈天的时候，合作社的社员们在自己的夜校里学习和读报。合作社就像个和睦的家庭，大家办啥事都齐心合力，啥事都办得整齐一致。
    有一天，保安合作社的社员们在他们那繁茂的麦田里锄草，每个人都穿着崭新的蓝斜纹布衣衫。一个叫谢怀祥的社员说：“这是合作社主席送给我们的。”他指着一个锄到前面去了的身材高大的农民：
    “他头年领导我们互助组使用新农具，使全组生产提高了三成多。我们组成了全省的一等模范组。我们组长被评为全省特等模范干部。省里奖给我们组
    一部综合铲趟机，奖给主席一匹斜纹布。他说功劳是大家的，硬把布分给我们每人作了一件蓝布衫。”
    保安合作社的主席叫徐连生。他早先是个长工，吃尽了苦中苦，学了一手好庄稼活。耕耩锄耧，赶车喂马，样样拿得起放得下。解放以后，他分了两公顷地。这是有生以来头一回给自家种地，他那种积极性就不用提了。徐连生完全知道自己的幸福是从那里来的，因此，他从心里感激共产党和人民政府。党和政府的各种号召，他总是带头响应。一九四九年，政府号召农民入山伐木。那时候，许多农民的觉悟程度不如现在高，不愿到那崇山峻岭中去伐木。徐连生套上自己的车马，向大家说：“没有共产党，咱就能分了地、有了车吗？如今国家建设需要木料，别说国家还给工钱，就是不给，也该去啊！”农民们听他说得对，就跟着他上了山。那年上山，因为徐连生领导的好，人马都没受冻，一套车马还挣了三、四百万元的工钱。农民们从心里拥护他，回家后就选他当了村长。几年来，他领导农民组织互助组，使用新农具，现在又领导大家成立了合作社。
    社员们谈起他们的新农具，谈起新农具和合作社的关系，兴致更加高起来了。
    他们说，新农具真是好东西。去年头一回用，每公顷麦子就比用旧农具种的多收了四百八十斤，每公顷大豆也多收了三百八十斤，因此，全组家家生活上升，买进了七匹大马，还有三户把弱马换成了强马。可是也发生了新的问题：新农具的效率太高，在互助组的小块土地上施展不开。“头年我用新农具种麦。有一天，前晌种的一块地，还剩下了四根垅，”社员张凤山说：“下午就为这四根垅，还得去一趟。播种机上有十个播种器，要种这四垅，只好堵上六个。你说这有多么不方便！”大家又说到王连富和林吉善两家：他两家的地挨在一起；王连富要在他的地上种一半麦子一半谷，林吉善怕别人占了他的地边，要在地边上种六垅谷子；这就把一块地割成了四块块，大块地也起不了大面积耕作的作用。
    去年秋后，大家正在被这个问题苦恼着，党和人民政府就派了干部，到这个屯子帮助组织合作社。徐连生和他的组员听了合作社怎样分红，怎样劳动，和怎样更加发挥新农具的作用的好处，都愿意马上成立合作社。那些还没有使用新农具的人，由于在去年没有跟着徐连生使用新农具，早已后悔得不得了；现在看见徐连生又带头组织合作社，知道合作社一定好，大家都抢着参加。徐连生就向大家说：“这是头一年，先稳当着来，办好了，明年大伙再入社。”村里人一听也很在理，便以徐连生互助组为基础，又吸收了五户，成立起一个包括十六户的合作社。别的人分别组成两个大型的常年互助组，也贷用了两套新农具。从此，四十三户人家的保安屯，便完全组织起来了。不论合作社和互助组，都使用新农具种地了。现在，两个互助组事事看着合作社，全村里人人瞅着徐连生。
    “还是我们这些人，还是我们那套新农具，”始终听着别人说话的徐连生说，“组成了合作社，一切都不同了。”
    徐连生详细地比较了合作社成立前后的变化。
    合作社的土地连成了片，实行统一经营：按土地的性质和楂口，该种啥就种啥。效率高的新农具，这就更能施展它的本事了。去年发生的那种机器跑空趟，接垅的土地由于各家种不同的庄稼而被割成小块的事情，再也没有了。播种机的效率比去年提高了百分之三十四。由于实行了统一经营，开始作到了地尽其利。今年计划每公顷的单位面积产量，比去年提高六百五十四斤，看目前庄稼生长的情况，这个目标只会超过，绝不会达不到。
    合作社里不仅作到地尽其利，物尽其用，而且作到了人尽其能。社员们有啥本事都能尽量施展出来。孟宪文早先是个长工，田里活计样样精通，大家便选他担任合作社的农业生产组长。谢怀猛身强力壮，干起活来又快又好；但是不善于计划。合作社请他担任耕作队的打头人，这种工作不用他自己作计划，只要按着合作社订好的计划，使劲往前干就行了。这就发挥了他的长处，弥补了他的短处。
    由于地尽其力，物尽其用，人尽其能，保安合作社每个劳动力负担的耕地面积，虽然由去年的四点四公顷增加到八公顷，但今年的耕作，还比去年互助组时作得更加细致。百分之八十二的耕地都已施肥，这在从来没有施肥习惯的北满草原上，是件很大的事情。合作社的小麦，都选用了优良品种，全部实行了温汤浸种和王铜消毒。大豆都是用的“满仓金”的好种子，播种时都接种了根瘤菌。保安屯的东北村边上，有一座高大的农具仓库，合作社主席徐连生说：“这是播种时盖起来的。劳动力负担的耕地面积比去年差一点多了一倍，因为用新农具更应手，劳动效率提高了，反倒有了多余的劳动力了。”今年春天，他们不仅抽出人手，盖起这座大仓库，还拨出两个人六匹马搞运输，挣洋二百多万元。
    新农具提高了土地产量，也促使农民进一步组织起来，逐步走向合作化；合作社又给新农具创造了充分发挥效能的新天地。怪不得农民们要说：合作社配上新农具，就像小鸟儿长上翅膀，越飞越高，越飞越远了，合作社飞到集体农庄，新农具飞到农业机械化。
