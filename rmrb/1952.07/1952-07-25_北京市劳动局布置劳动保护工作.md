The Beijing Labor Bureau of the Municipal People's Government convened labor protection work conferences on the 4th, 7th, and 9th of this month, respectively, gathering labor protection cadres from various state-owned and publicly-operated factories and mines. The conferences were held to deploy labor protection work within the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, with the aim of achieving safe production.

According to inspections, some factories and mines have already established safety organizations and formulated safety work plans. For example, the Beijing Machine Factory has started by providing safety education to workers and cultivating model groups, with plans for widespread implementation. The Capital Power Plant in Shijingshan has established a safety group under the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee to lead the factory's safety, hygiene, and labor protection work. The Liulihe Cement Plant has established a workshop inspection and registration system, and selected workshop inspectors to conduct regular inspections, registrations, and handling of issues.

Currently, the most serious problem in labor protection work is the lack of sufficient attention from leadership. The administrative leadership of many factories harbors erroneous thinking, such as prioritizing production over safety, valuing machine safety over personal safety, and simply emphasizing economic difficulties. Consequently, they lack dedicated organizations or personnel responsible for safety, neglecting worker safety and leading to a series of casualties and accidents. Many factories have only made general appeals, lacking continuous education and concrete organizational work.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided that all factories and mines must address the following issues: (1) Administrative leaders should immediately prioritize safe production, rely on the masses, and do a good job in labor protection work, establishing and improving labor protection organizations and systems. (2) Administration and trade unions should vigorously conduct safety and hygiene publicity and education work, so that every employee understands what labor protection work is and possesses necessary hygiene knowledge. (3) Under economic conditions that permit and without technical difficulties, general safety equipment and protective gear should be fully resolved. (4) Overtime work or extended working hours are not allowed without permission. (5) Efforts should be made to reduce the temperature in high-temperature workshops; provide summer drinks, and at least have sufficient boiling water available; harmful liquids, gases, and dust should be addressed as much as possible.

(6) Give appropriate care to female and child laborers; pregnant female workers in their sixth month should be transferred to lighter work; factories and mines with many children should set up nurseries or breastfeeding rooms. (7) Appropriately address the living difficulties of employees with long-term illnesses so that they can continue treatment; each factory should establish an amateur sanatorium so that employees working while ill can receive rest. (8) The rainy season is approaching, and all factories should inspect engineering equipment and repair houses to avoid crushing accidents.

    北京市劳动局布置劳动保护工作
    北京市人民政府劳动局在本月四、七、九日三天分别召集各国营、公营厂矿劳动保护工作干部，举行劳动保护工作会议，布置爱国增产节约竞赛运动中的劳动保护工作，做到安全生产。
    根据检查，有些厂矿已经建立了安全组织和订出了安全工作计划，如北京机器厂首先对工人进行安全教育，并培养典型小组，准备普遍推广。石景山首都发电厂在增产节约竞赛委员会下成立了安全组，领导全厂的安全卫生和劳动保护工作。琉璃河水泥厂建立了车间检查和登记制度，并选出车间检查员，定期进行检查、登记和处理。
    目前，劳动保护工作中最严重的问题是领导上没有足够的重视。不少厂的行政领导上存在着重视生产，不注意安全；重视机器安全，不注意人身安全；单纯强调经济困难等错误思想，因而没有专门组织或专门干部负责，忽视工人安全，以致发生了一连串的伤亡事故。很多厂只做了一般号召，缺乏经常性的教育和具体的组织工作。
    北京市人民政府劳动局决定各厂矿企业必须解决以下的问题：（一）行政领导应该立即重视安全生产，依靠群众，做好劳动保护工作，建立和健全劳保组织与制度。（二）行政和工会应大力进行安全卫生的宣传教育工作，使每一个职工都知道什么是劳动保护工作，都有必要的卫生常识。（三）在经济许可而又没有技术困难的条件下，一般的安全设备和防护用具，应该全部解决。（四）不许随便加班加点或延长工时。（五）设法降低高温车间的温度；供应夏季饮料，至少应备有足够的开水；有害身体健康的液体、气体和灰尘，尽可能研究解决。
    （六）适当照顾女工、童工；怀孕六个月的女工，应调换轻便工作；小孩多的厂矿，应设立托儿所或哺乳室。（七）适当照顾长期疾病职工生活的困难，使其继续治疗；各厂建立业余休养所，使带病工作的职工得到休养。（八）雨季已临，各厂应检查工程设备和检修房屋，避免砸伤事故。
