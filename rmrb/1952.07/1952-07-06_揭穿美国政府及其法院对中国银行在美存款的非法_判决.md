A short commentary:

    The Bank of China's head office's deposits in the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, USA (US$600,000), were recently subjected to an illegal "judgment" by the California court in the United States, and were taken away under false pretenses by a small group of fleeing bandits, including the war criminal Kong Xiangxi. This incident, as pointed out by Gong Yinbing, General Manager of the Bank of China, in his protest, is a completely absurd, unreasonable, and illegal "judgment." At the same time, the US court and its judges fully exposed its self-contradictory ugly state of completely ignoring the facts when enforcing this illegal "judgment."
    All the rights and interests of the Bank of China, at home and abroad, belong to the Chinese people (including private shareholders and depositors). The head office of the bank is effectively managing its branches at home and abroad, and carrying out business; at each board meeting, effective representatives of the ten private shareholders regularly have seven people in attendance. More than 80 percent of all private shareholders of the bank have completed the re-registration procedures for shareholders within less than half a year, and have received dividends. The above facts irrefutably prove that the head office of the Bank of China is the sole legal representative of all its rights and interests at home and abroad. That is to say, the head office of the Bank of China is the sole legal handler of this deposit in Wells Fargo Bank, which is also beyond doubt. These ironclad facts were even admitted by Judge Gutman of the California court in the United States. In his judgment on July 17, 1950, Gutman said:
    "This money belongs to a Chinese company... The funds of this company should be used to fulfill the purposes of the company... This company was created to operate general banking business, and it has twenty-nine institutions abroad to promote trade between China and other countries. The Bank of China cannot perform its tasks if it is separated from China. Its depositors and five thousand private shareholders, as well as the Chinese people—who can be said to be the ultimate owners of the public shares—are all living under a government that effectively leads the country. As for the fleeing 'directors'... some are missing, and some can no longer speak on behalf of the Chinese people regarding the business of the Bank of China. As for the rest, it is a big question whether private shareholders will still elect them, so if the deposit is handed over to these people, the protection of the interests of the company's shareholders and depositors is unimaginable."
    However, the US imperialist government and its courts, which have always been hostile to the Chinese people, not only did not pronounce judgment according to the facts and did not return the Bank of China's head office's deposits in Wells Fargo Bank to the bank, but first illegally declared the freezing of the deposit in July 1950, preventing the Bank of China's head office from withdrawing it, and then made an absurd and illegal declaration in March 1952, allowing a small group of fleeing bandits, including the war criminal Kong Xiangxi, who were forever spurned by the Chinese people, to openly seize the property of the Chinese people. This incident fully demonstrates that the "judgment" of the US government and its courts is extremely absurd, unreasonable, and illegal. At the same time, it once again exposes how the US government is hostile to the interests of the Chinese people!

    揭穿美国政府及其法院对中国银行在美存款的非法“判决”
    中国银行总管理处在美国旧金山威尔斯发哥银行的存款（六十万元美金），最近遭到美国加里福尼亚州法院的非法“判决”，被战犯孔祥熙等一小撮逃亡匪徒冒名夺去。这一事件，正如中国银行总经理龚饮冰在抗议中所指出的：是一完全荒谬的、无理的、非法的“判决”。同时美国法院及其法官在执行这一非法“判决”时，还充分暴露它完全抹杀事实自相矛盾的丑态。
    中国银行在国内、外的全部权益，属于中国人民（包括私股股东及存款人）。该行总管理处正有效地管辖其国内、国外的分支行处，开展业务；历次董事会议，有效代表私股董事十人中经常有七人出席。该行全体私股股东已有百分之八十以上在不到半年内办完股东重新登记手续，而且取得股息。以上事实无可争辩地证明了中国银行总管理处是该行在国内和国外全部权益的唯一合法代表人。这就是说：中国银行总管理处是威尔斯发哥银行这项存款的唯一合法处理者，也是无容置疑的。这些铁一般的事实，就连美国加里福尼亚州法官古特曼也曾承认过。一九五○年七月十七日古特曼的判决书中曾说：
    “这笔钱属于一个中国的公司。……这公司的资金是应该用以完成公司的目的。……这个公司的创设，旨在经营一般银行业务，它在国外有二十九个机构，用来促进中国和其他各国间的贸易。中国银行如与中国分开，就不能执行它的任务了。它的存户和五千个私股股东以及中国人民——他们可说是公股股份的最后所有权者，——都是在一个事实上领导全国的政府之下生活。至于逃亡的‘董事’们……有的不知去向，有的不能再就中国银行业务代表中国人民说话。其余则是否私股股东还会选举他们，尚是一大疑问，故如果把该存款交给这些人则该公司股东及存户利益的保障问题，便难想像了。”
    可是一贯敌视中国人民的美帝国主义政府及其法院，非但不按事实宣判，不将中国银行总管理处在威尔斯发哥银行的存款归还该行，反而始则于一九五○年七月，非法宣判冻结该项存款，不让中国银行总管理处提回，继则于一九五二年三月荒谬绝伦的非法宣判，使战犯孔祥熙等一小撮被中国人民所永远唾弃的逃亡匪徒得以公然夺去中国人民的财产。这一事件充分说明美国政府及其法院的“判决”，乃是极端荒谬的、无理的、非法的。同时，又一次暴露了美国政府对中国人民的利益是如何的仇视！
