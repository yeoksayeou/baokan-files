Economic Life Brief Commentary

    The gas explosion accident at the Yangquan Mining Bureau once again illustrates that a purely task-oriented viewpoint is the greatest enemy of safe production in coal mines. Generally speaking, the leading cadres of many mines understand the important significance of safe production and value the lives of workers. However, in their specific work, they often consider how to complete production tasks and reduce production costs in isolation and one-sidedly, while neglecting safety issues, and even violating safety regulations in order to complete tasks and reduce costs. The Yangquan gas explosion accident was caused in this way.
    It is right for the leading cadres of state-owned factories and mines to strive to complete the state's production plans and reduce production costs in order to accumulate funds for the country. However, if they do not pay attention to safety issues, it is a serious mistake that will cause serious losses, which are immeasurable and irreparable.
    The leading cadres of all factories and mines should learn from the painful lessons of the Yangquan gas explosion accident and correctly resolve this issue. They should recognize that this purely task-oriented viewpoint is essentially a bourgeois management viewpoint. Only factories and mines operated by the bourgeoisie care only about production and not about the safety of workers. If the leading cadres of state-owned factories and mines firmly stand on the position of the working class, they will inevitably resolutely implement the safety production policy, give full play to their high degree of initiative and responsibility, and protect the safety of workers. They must not separate the safety production policy and discount safety work.
    Now, a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice thrift has begun. When the labor enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and when the masses are throwing themselves into the competition movement, leading cadres should pay more attention to safety issues. Leading cadres at all levels should thoroughly criticize the purely task-oriented viewpoint and other erroneous ideas that neglect safe production, conscientiously implement the safety production policy, and strive to ensure that no accidents occur.

    必须保证煤矿的安全生产
    阳泉矿务局瓦斯爆炸事故，再一次说明了单纯任务观点是煤矿实行安全生产的最大敌人。一般说来，许多矿山的领导干部，是懂得安全生产的重要意义的，是重视工人的生命安全的。但是，在具体工作中，他们常常是孤立地、片面地考虑如何完成生产任务，如何降低生产成本，而忽视了安全问题，甚至为了完成任务和降低成本，不惜违犯保安规程。阳泉瓦斯爆炸事故，就是这样造成的。
    国营厂矿的领导干部，努力完成国家的生产计划，努力降低生产成本，以便为国家积累资金，这是对的。但是，如果不注意安全问题，那就是极大的错误，就会造成严重的损失，这种损失，是无可计量和无法补偿的。
    各个厂矿的领导干部，应该接受阳泉瓦斯爆炸事故的惨痛教训，正确地解决这个问题。应该认识，这种单纯任务观点，实质上是一种资产阶级的经营观点。只有资产阶级经营的工厂、矿山，才只管生产而不管工人安全的。国营厂矿的领导干部，如果站稳了工人阶级的立场，就必然要坚决地贯彻安全生产方针，发挥高度的积极性和责任心，保护工人的安全，决不能把安全生产方针割裂开来，在安全工作上打折扣。
    现在，大规模的增产节约运动已经开始。当群众的劳动热情十分高涨的时候，当群众奋不顾身地投入竞赛运动的时候，领导干部就更应该注意安全问题。各级领导干部应该彻底批判单纯任务观点以及其他忽视安全生产的错误思想，认真贯彻安全生产方针，努力保证不发生事故。
