World People Oppose Bacteriological Warfare
—Soviet "Pravda" Editorial on the 16th

The Special Session of the World Peace Council approved the "Declaration Against Bacteriological Warfare" adopted by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council at its Oslo meeting on April 1, 1952.

The World Peace Council's declaration expresses the will of millions of peace advocates demanding a ban on bacteriological weapons. This declaration is the cry of protest from all progressive humanity, who consider bacteriological warfare a heinous crime, an inhuman weapon of aggression aimed at the mass slaughter of peaceful residents. The World Peace Council calls on all peoples to take immediate action to stop bacteriological warfare.

The World Peace Council document states: "We call on humanity to rise in self-defense."

Recent developments, the new provocative acts of aggression by American interventionists in Korea and China, particularly powerfully demonstrate the urgent importance of the World Peace Council's declaration. The investigative materials on the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China submitted to the Special Session of the World Peace Council, the testimonies of witnesses who personally saw planes dropping objects infected with various disease-causing bacilli, the testimonies of witnesses who personally picked up shrapnel and personally saw and described the characteristics and features of many insects—all of this documentary evidence undeniably proves that bacteriological warfare was launched and conducted by the US imperialists according to a predetermined plan.

The documents submitted to the World Peace Council concerning the monstrous crimes that the American aggressors have committed and are committing in the war against the Korean people are arousing the anger and disgust of all honest men and women. These documents reveal a cold-blooded, extremely cruel plan to destroy an entire nation by inhuman methods such as spreading infectious gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, cholera, and plague, as well as poisoning water and contaminating food with bacteria.

The results of detailed scientific investigations in Korea and Northeast China and the testimonies of many witnesses completely shattered the aggressors' and their hired thugs' nonsense that the outbreaks of plague or cholera were due to infectious disease relations. The truth cannot be covered up, and facts cannot be destroyed! Many facts prove that objects infected with bacilli were dropped by American planes in many areas of Korea and China. The reactionary press, serving millionaires and billionaires—the masterminds behind the heinous crimes committed in Korea and China—vainly attempts to bury the World Peace Council's resolutions. However, it cannot hide these resolutions, just as it has not been able to and will not be able to keep the people from knowing the facts about bacteriological warfare and the barbaric methods used by the US imperialists and their servants in Korea and Northeast China.

Facts will break through the smokescreen of lies and slander. More and more evidence is being revealed exposing the aggressors' criminal actions. Irrefutable documents and facts are a stern indictment of those responsible for continuing the Korean War and using inhuman means of warfare. The fact of the use of bacteriological weapons has greatly drawn the attention of public opinion in all countries and all nations. This has prompted public organizations to take measures to investigate the truth about what happened in Korea and Northeast China. It is well known that authoritative investigative teams, such as the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team and the Chinese public organizations' investigation team, have worked in Korea and China for a long time. The documents and factual materials they collected and the conclusions they reached have been widely disseminated and are well known to international public opinion.

Recently, world public opinion has again heard testimony from such authoritative witnesses as the famous peace fighter Johnson, proving that the US conduct of bacteriological warfare is an undeniable fact. Speaking of the bacteriological attacks on Northeast China, Johnson said that the evidence of the use of bacteriological weapons is conclusive and undeniable, and the truth cannot be covered up.

Johnson spoke of his visit to the exhibitions of material evidence of the US use of bacteriological weapons in Beijing and Shenyang. He cited the confessions of American pilots Quinn and Enak, who participated in bacteriological warfare. Johnson described his on-site investigation in certain areas of Northeast China where bacteriological bombs had been dropped, where he saw test tubes containing bacteria-carrying insects. Finally, he cited conversations with Chinese Christians who confirmed the use of bacteriological weapons and showed people documents signed by many Chinese church leaders.

The reactionary newspapers of the United States and Britain raved about Johnson's testimony regarding the bacteriological warfare attacks on Northeast China and launched an outright persecution campaign against Johnson. Just as in the past, this corrupt newspaper demanded that Mrs. Felton be thrown into jail for truthfully recounting the situation in Korea and considered that she could only be spared death, now the leaders of the reactionaries are also demanding that Johnson be subjected to the most brutal police persecution. However, no matter how uncontrollably angry the reactionary newspapers are, they cannot erase the indictment testimony of the heroic peace fighter, nor can they offer any powerful defense against his revelations.

The logic of facts is the most powerful logic. Public opinion in various countries is increasingly aware that it is not accidental that the US representative to the United Nations stubbornly obstructs the adoption of the Soviet proposal to ban bacteriological weapons, nor is it accidental that they are unwilling to discuss this issue in the Security Council with the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is also not accidental that among the major countries, the United States is the only country that has not ratified the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, which prohibits the use of poison gas and bacteriological methods of warfare. To this day, the US government still refuses to ratify this protocol.

Based on these facts, public opinion can draw appropriate conclusions. Millions of good people in all countries are protesting against the aggressive policy of the US ruling clique, which is waging a struggle in Korea and using bacteriological weapons in this war. The peace-loving people of all countries are even more indignant at the recent series of aggressive actions, such as the barbaric bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants, the barbaric bombing of Pyongyang, and the provocative attacks on Chinese cities. In addition to the US ruling clique, the governments of other countries that are jointly conducting an unjust war against the peace-loving Korean people under the guise of the United Nations flag must also bear responsibility for all these aggressive actions. The World Peace Council's declaration states: "The fact that the Korean War is being waged in the name of the United Nations is a particularly serious situation; we believe that those governments that have approved UN intervention and are therefore morally and politically responsible for the methods used in waging the war must be held accountable for this situation."

The World Peace Council's declaration demanding a halt to bacteriological warfare has been supported by the broadest strata of people in all countries, by all honest men and women, and by all progressive humanity. The Soviet people, who are advancing at the forefront of peace fighters, fully support the World Peace Council's declaration, considering it a valuable contribution to the struggle for peace and international security.

    世界人民反对细菌战
    ——苏联“真理报”十六日社论
    世界和平理事会特别会议批准了世界和平理事会常务委员会在一九五二年四月一日奥斯陆会议上通过的“反对细菌战”的宣言。
    世界和平理事会的宣言表达了要求禁止细菌武器的千百万和平拥护者的意志。这个宣言是全体进步人类的抗议呼声，他们认为细菌战是一种万恶的罪行，是一种惨无人道的侵略武器，其目的是大规模地屠杀和平居民。世界和平理事会号召各族人民立即采取行动，制止细菌战。
    世界和平理事会的这个文件说：“我们号召人类起来自卫。”
    最近的发展，美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国进行的新的挑衅侵略行动，特别有力地说明了世界和平理事会这个宣言的迫切重要性。向世界和平理事会特别会议提出的关于在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的调查材料，曾亲眼看见飞机投掷感染有传染各种疾病的杆状细菌的东西的见证人的证词，曾亲自拾到过炸弹片以及曾亲眼看到过许多昆虫并描述了它们的性状和特征的见证人的证词——所有这一切证明文件不容怀疑地证明了细菌战是美帝国主义者按照预先拟订的一定计划发动和进行的。
    向世界和平理事会提出的关于美国侵略者在对朝鲜人民进行的罪恶战争中所干的而且正在干的滔天罪行的文件，正引起所有正直男女的愤怒和憎恶。这些文件揭发了一个冷血的、残酷无比的计划，这计划就是以散布传染性肠胃病、呼吸器官病、霍乱和鼠疫以及在水中放毒、使食物带菌等惨无人道的方法来毁灭整个民族。
    在朝鲜和中国东北进行的详细的科学调查的结果和许多见证人的证词，完全粉碎了侵略者和他们所雇佣的凶徒所说鼠疫或霍乱的爆发是由于传染病关系的胡说。真理是掩盖不住的，事实是毁灭不了的！许多事实证明：感染有杆状细菌的东西是由美国飞机投掷在朝鲜和中国的许多地区的。为百万富翁和亿万富翁们——在朝鲜和中国所干的凶恶罪行的主谋者——服务的反动报界，妄想把世界和平理事会的决议掩埋起来。但是，它掩藏不了这些决议，正如它没有能够而且将来也不能够使人民不知道关于细菌战的事实以及美帝国主义者与他们的仆从在朝鲜和中国东北所使用的野蛮手段。
    事实是会冲破谎言与诽谤的烟幕的。揭发侵略者的罪恶行动的证据愈来愈多。无可辩驳的文件和事实，对于那些应对继续进行朝鲜战争和使用惨无人道的战争手段负责的人们，是一个严厉的控诉。使用细菌武器的事实，大大地引起了所有国家和所有民族的舆论的注意。这促使公众团体采取措施，来调查在朝鲜和中国东北发生的事情的真情实况。大家知道，国际民主法律工作者协会的调查团、中国公众团体的调查团等权威的调查团，曾经在朝鲜和中国工作了一个长时候。它们所收集的文件和事实材料以及它们所作的结论，已经广为传布，已经为国际公众所熟知。
    最近，世界舆论又从著名和平战士约翰逊这样权威的见证人处听到了证明，证明美国进行细菌战是一件无可置辩的事实。约翰逊在谈到对中国东北地区进行的细菌袭击时说，使用细菌武器一事的证据是确凿的，无可置辩的，真相是掩盖不了的。
    约翰逊谈到了他在北京和沈阳参观的美国使用细菌武器的物证展览。他引证了参加细菌战的美国飞行员奎恩和伊纳克的供词。约翰逊叙述了他到曾投下过细菌弹的中国东北某些地方去考查的情形，他在这些地方看到了试管里装的带菌昆虫。最后，他引证了中国基督教徒证实使用了细菌武器的谈话，并让人们看了有中国许多教会领袖签名的一些文件。
    美国和英国的反动报纸对约翰逊关于中国东北遭受细菌战进攻的证言大肆咆哮，并对约翰逊发动了
    一个不折不扣的迫害运动。正像过去这种腐败的报纸因为费尔顿夫人真实地叙述了朝鲜的情况而要求把她投入牢狱并认为仅可以免她一死一样，现在，反动派的领导人物也要求对约翰逊实行最残暴的警察迫害。但是，不管反动报纸怎样怒不可抑，它是抹杀不了英勇和平战士的控诉证词的，也无法对他的揭发提出任何有力的辩解。
    事实的逻辑是最有力的逻辑。各国公众愈来愈清楚地认识到：美国驻联合国代表顽固地阻挠通过苏联所提禁止细菌武器的建议并不是偶然的，他们不愿意在中华人民共和国代表与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的参加下在安全理事会来讨论这个问题，也不是偶然的。在各大国中间，美国是唯一没有批准一九二五年六月十七日禁用毒气和细菌方法作战的日内瓦议定书的国家，这一点，也不是偶然的。一直到现在美国政府都还拒绝批准这个议定书。
    根据这些事实，舆论界可以得出适当的结论。各国千百万善良的人民都在抗议美国统治集团的侵略政策，这个统治集团正在朝鲜进行斗争，并在这个战争中使用细菌武器。由于最近对鸭绿江水力发电厂的野蛮轰炸、对平壤的野蛮轰炸以及对中国城市的挑衅袭击这一连串的侵略行动，爱好和平的各国人民是更感愤慨了。这一切侵略行动的责任，除了美国统治集团以外，其他在联合国旗帜的掩盖下共同对爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行不义战争的国家的政府也必须担负。世界和平理事会的宣言说：“朝鲜战争之用联合国名义进行，是一种特别严重的情况；我们认为：那些赞成联合国进行干涉因而对进行战争所使用的方法负有道义和政治责任的政府，应对这种情况负责。”
    世界和平理事会要求制止细菌战的宣言受到了各国最广大阶层人民的支持，受到了一切正直的男女的支持，受到了全体进步人类的支持。在和平战士最前列前进的苏联人民全力支持世界和平理事会的宣言。认为这是对争取和平与国际安全的斗争的宝贵贡献。
