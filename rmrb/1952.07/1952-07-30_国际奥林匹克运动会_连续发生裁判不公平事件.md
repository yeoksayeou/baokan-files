Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, July 29th: According to reports in the Finnish press, unfair refereeing incidents have occurred in some of the competitions at the International Olympic Games. For example, in the weightlifting competitions currently underway, some referees are deliberately obstructing athletes from certain countries from achieving good results. The American middleweight lifter, Stanczyk, committed a foul during the clean and jerk, but it was judged as correct.

    The Finnish newspaper "Free Discussion" pointed out that the referee responsible for the middleweight competition was clearly "unfair." The paper said that the American athlete Stanczyk wanted to achieve a record of 127.5 kilograms, but all three side referees unanimously rejected his clean and jerk because his heels left the ground and he clearly paused during the clean and jerk motion. However, the refereeing committee overturned the unanimous decision of the side referees and approved Stanczyk's clean and jerk. The chairman of the committee is an American. In the same competition, the outstanding Soviet athlete Vorobyov was illegally prevented from attempting his third lift. Similar facts are numerous.

    It should be pointed out that representatives from some countries are also exerting crude pressure on the refereeing committee, which has not only aroused the indignation of many spectators but also the strong indignation of some referees. For example, the French referee Rondam angrily left the referee's seat to protest. Referees Hakonnan (Finland) and Kerridge (Britain) also walked out. Many referees are unwilling to accept appointments. Therefore, the President of the International Weightlifting Federation, the American Wassman, and the team leader of the American team, Genman, have had to find other referees to enable the competition to continue.

    Incorrect refereeing has also occurred in wrestling competitions. The match between Soviet wrestler Giryan and Lebanese wrestler Chihab on the afternoon of the 27th is one example. The referee ruled in favor of the Lebanese athlete by a vote of two to one. "The Finnish Social Democrat" newspaper pointed out on the 28th: "This ruling should at least be described as questionable. We watched the match carefully, and we believe this ruling is completely wrong."

    Many Finnish newspapers have pointed out the unfair refereeing in gymnastics competitions. "The Finnish Social Democrat" emphasized that the referees are either deliberately making such rulings or are incompetent. Such referees are not suitable for officiating in such important competitions. This situation is very inconsistent with the sporting ethics of the Olympic Games, which athletes from all countries have sworn to uphold.

### 国际奥林匹克运动会  连续发生裁判不公平事件

    国际奥林匹克运动会
    连续发生裁判不公平事件
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：据芬兰报纸报道，在国际奥林匹克运动会比赛中，某些裁判员的裁判曾有不公平的情事。例如现在正在进行的举重比赛，有些裁判员故意阻挠一些国家的运动员获得优良的成绩。美国中量级选手斯丹齐克在挺举时犯了规，但却被认为是正确的。芬兰报纸
    “自由谈”报指出：负责中量级比赛的裁判员显然是“不公平的”。该报说：美国运动员斯丹齐克想达到一百二十七点五公斤的纪录，但是三个侧面裁判员一致不通过他的挺举，因为他的脚跟离开了地面，并且在挺举的动作中间显然停顿过。但是裁判委员会修改了侧面裁判员的一致决定，通过了斯丹齐克的挺举。而委员会的主席正是一个美国人。在同一次比赛中，苏联杰出的运动员伏罗比也夫被非法禁止试作第三次的推举。诸如此类的事实很多。
    应该指出：某些国家的代表还对裁判委员会施行粗暴压力，这不仅引起了许多观众的愤慨，而且也引起了一些裁判员的强烈愤慨。例如，法国裁判员容达姆曾愤而离开裁判席，以示抗议。裁判员哈康南（芬兰）、克尔莱葛（英国）也曾退席。许多裁判员都不愿接受聘请。因此，国际举重联合会主席、美国人华斯曼和美国队领队根曼不得不物色其他裁判员，以便使比赛得以继续进行。
    在角力比赛中也有裁判得不正确的情形。二十七日下午苏联角力选手吉尔扬和黎巴嫩角力选手契哈勃比赛就是一个例子。裁判员以二票对一票判定黎巴嫩选手获胜。“芬兰社会民主主义者报”在二十八日指出：“这种裁决至少应该说是可以怀疑的。我们曾仔细观看这场比赛，我们认为这种裁决是完全错误的。”
    许多芬兰报纸都指出机巧运动比赛中裁判不公正的情形。“芬兰社会民主主义者报”强调说：裁判员不是故意这样裁判就是裁判得不称职。这样的裁判员不适宜在如此重要的比赛中担任裁判。这种情况很不符合各国运动员所宣誓遵守的奥林匹克运动会的运动道德。
