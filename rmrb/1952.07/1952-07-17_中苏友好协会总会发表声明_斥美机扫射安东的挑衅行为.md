    All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Issues Statement
    Condemning US Aircraft for Strafing Provocative Act in Andong
    [Report from this newspaper] The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement on the 16th, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of the 12th, protesting the provocative act of US aircraft strafing Andong. The statement said: While unreasonably delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have carried out a series of direct provocative actions against the Chinese people. This once again exposes the sinister intention of the American aggressors to deliberately expand the war of aggression and their extremely vicious face, proving that they are the most brutal and deadly enemies of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the crimes of US aircraft arbitrarily invading the sacred airspace of our motherland and killing our peaceful residents. We, representing more than 25 million members of this association, express our utmost anger at this new shameless atrocity of the American aggressors. We firmly believe that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union and based on the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, will surely thwart any enemy conspiracies and tricks. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of July 12. This arrogant provocative act by the American aggressors will surely reap its own evil consequences and will absolutely not escape the severe and just punishment of peace-loving people all over the world.
