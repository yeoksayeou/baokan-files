    Leading Cadres of Xiuwu County, Pingyuan,
    Should Not Neglect Tax Work
    To the Editor:
    During the "Three-Anti" movement in Xiuwu County, Xinxiang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, the leading cadres only knew how to transfer cadres to fight "tigers" and did not pay attention to tax work, so that tax operations were suspended during the "Three-Anti" movement. They failed to report the accounting monthly reports from January to May and the accounting ten-day reports from February to May, which affected the comprehensive summary and reporting by the higher-level tax bureau and hindered the progress of the work. The provincial and prefectural tax bureaus have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to the county to urge them, but this has not attracted the attention of the county's leadership. It was not until the "Three-Anti" movement entered its final stage that the county's leadership transferred an administrative section chief to preside over the work of the county tax bureau. However, this administrative section chief was not familiar with accounting work, so the accounting ten-day reports and monthly reports still could not be reported. He repeatedly requested the county's leadership to transfer accounting personnel to work in the bureau, but the county's leadership still ignored it.

    After the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, the Provincial Tax Bureau convened a meeting of bureau chiefs of tax bureaus at all levels in the province, prefecture, city, and county, and arranged the current central work, the collection of the 1952 first-quarter industrial and commercial tax. The county's leadership not only did not try to assist in completing this tax task, but instead transferred the main responsible cadres of the tax bureau, such as the bureau chief and section chief (a total of five people), to the countryside to engage in wheat harvesting, leaving only two comrades who were unfamiliar with the business to work in the county bureau. Therefore, the county's industrial and commercial tax for the first quarter of this year could not be collected smoothly.
    The accounting monthly reports from January to May and the accounting ten-day reports from February to May have not been compiled and sent to this day. The above situation shows that the leading cadres of Xiuwu County have a serious idea of neglecting tax work. I think these cadres should quickly correct this phenomenon and conduct a profound self-criticism.    Weng Zhigong

### 平原修武县领导干部  不该忽视税收工作
翁之功

    平原修武县领导干部
    不该忽视税收工作
    编辑同志：平原省新乡专区修武县的领导干部，在“三反”运动中，只知抽调干部打“虎”，不注意税务工作，以致“三反”运动期间，税收业务陷于停顿。一至五月份的会计月报和二至五月份的会计旬报，他们全没有上报，影响了上级税局全面汇总编报，妨碍了工作的进展。省和专区的税局曾数次向该县函电催促，但仍没有引起该县领导方面的注意。直到“三反”运动进入最后阶段，该县领导方面才抽调一个行政股长主持县税局的工作。但是这位行政股长对会计工作很不熟悉，以致会计旬报、月报仍不能上报。他曾几次请求县的领导方面调派会计人员到局工作，县的领导方面却仍置之不理。
    “三反”运动结束以后，省税局召开全省专区、市、县各级税局局长会议，布置了当前中心工作，开征一九五二年第一季工商业税。县的领导方面不但不设法协助完成这一税收任务，反而把税局局长、股长等主要负责干部（共五人）抽调下乡，搞麦收工作，只留两个业务生疏的同志在县局工作。因此，该县今年第一季度工商税就没能顺利开征，
    一至五月份会计月报和二至五月份会计旬报至今仍没编送。以上情况，说明修武县领导干部有严重忽视税收工作的思想。我觉得这些干部应迅速纠正这种现象，并作深刻检讨。    翁之功
