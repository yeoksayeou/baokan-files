    Resolutely Prevent Asphalt Poisoning Accidents

    To the Editor: The Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department used poor packaging when transporting asphalt, resulting in the poisoning of more than a dozen dockworkers in Tianjin on June 13th during loading. After the poisoning, they experienced tearing, frothing at the mouth, red and swollen eyes, and even life-threatening conditions. After this incident, the Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department sent people to the Xi'an Trust Company to inform relevant departments and request them to pay attention when unloading the goods upon arrival. On June 22nd, when this batch of asphalt was transported to Xi'an, the Xi'an dockworkers took precautions, but because the asphalt was packaged in straw, asphalt dust still flew out during handling, sticking to the workers' faces or entering their nostrils, resulting in another major accident with nineteen workers poisoned.

    In order to learn from these two injury accidents, I hope that in the future, both sellers and buyers will pay attention to the safety of asphalt packaging. It is best to use iron or painted wooden barrels to pack asphalt, and not simply ignore the lives and safety of workers for the sake of more profit or saving a few dollars. The Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department and other relevant departments must earnestly solve this problem to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. Shi Zhenhua

    切实防止沥青中毒事故
    编辑同志：东北贸易部天津办事处运输沥青时包装不好，以致六月十三日天津装卸工人在装车时有十多人中毒，中毒后，流泪、口吐白沫、眼睛红肿，甚至有生命的危险。发生此次事件后，东北贸易部天津办事处曾派人到西安市信托公司，将情况转告有关部门，请他们在货到卸车时注意。六月二十二日，当这批沥青运到西安，西安市装卸工人虽然作了防备，但由于沥青是用草包装的，因之在搬运时，沥青灰尘仍然飞出，粘在工人面部或钻入鼻孔，以致又发生十九名工人中毒的重大事故。
    为了吸收这两次伤害事故的经验，我希望今后卖者或买者，都务必注意包装沥青的安全，最好改用铁桶或油漆木桶装沥青，不能单纯地为了多得利润或省几个钱而忽视工人的生命和安全。东北贸易部天津办事处和其他有关部门必须认真解决这个问题，保证以后不再发生这类事件。  史振华
