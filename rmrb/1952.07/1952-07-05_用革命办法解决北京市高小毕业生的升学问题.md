    Solving the Enrollment Problem of Beijing's Senior Primary School Graduates Through Revolutionary Methods
    Wang Yimin
    According to recent statistics, the total number of senior primary school graduates in Beijing's urban and suburban areas this year is 19,575. Adding to this the number of students from other regions applying to Beijing and the number of out-of-school youth in the city seeking further education, the number of students entering the first year of junior high school this year will be over 20,000 (excluding those who cannot enroll for various reasons). However, the current capacity of the first year of junior high school in the city is not commensurate with this demand: the total number of classes offered by public and private middle schools in Beijing is 227, accommodating 11,350 students. This means that the enrollment problem of about half of the senior primary school graduates cannot be solved. This is a major issue facing Beijing's education workers. Of course, given the country's current financial and economic conditions, we will strive for schools to appropriately construct some school buildings and increase the number of classes, but the increase cannot be significant.

    During the unified enrollment last autumn, in order to take care of and solve the enrollment difficulties of senior primary school graduates as much as possible, and with reference to the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Night Classes Attached to Ordinary Middle Schools" drafted by the Northeast Ministry of Education, we fully utilized existing school buildings and equipment conditions to open 17 night classes, solving the enrollment problem for some students. Over the past year, through the joint efforts of school leaders, many difficulties have been overcome, and night classes have been changed to day classes or afternoon half-day classes, arranging courses in the vacant periods of the day classes as much as possible. However, the available vacant periods are always limited, and as the number of classes increases, there will be no space to insert them.

    Now, based on the initial experience of running night classes, we propose the "two classes one classroom" and "three classes two classrooms" methods to strive to completely solve the enrollment problem of this year's senior primary school graduates.

    We believe that this method is entirely feasible. With the method of two classes using one classroom, each class has 31 lessons per week. Except for physical education, which takes place on the playground for two lessons per week and does not occupy the classroom, and music class, which can occupy the music classroom or auditorium, the remaining courses can be rotated between the two classes, A and B, using one classroom, and the class time in the morning and afternoon is equal. At the same time, when the school specifically arranges the timetable, it can plan to arrange subjects such as Chinese and mathematics in the morning, and other subjects such as history, geography, and art in the afternoon according to the different nature of the courses. In order to avoid the frequent phenomenon of students from two classes changing classrooms, one class can occupy the classroom in the morning and afternoon, or one class can use two or three consecutive lessons. With the method of three classes using two classrooms, each class has 31 lessons per week. Except for physical education, which takes place on the playground for two lessons per week and does not occupy the classroom, and music class, which can occupy the music classroom or auditorium, the remaining courses are 28 lessons, and each class has an equal opportunity to occupy the classroom in the morning and afternoon, that is, 20 lessons in the morning and 8 lessons in the afternoon. However, in terms of specific use, classes A and B are the main ones, each occupying a fixed classroom, while class C is divided into two classrooms for classes, and the total number of lessons occupied in the two classrooms is still equal to those of classes A and B. At the same time, in order to make the opportunity for each class to enjoy a fixed classroom more equal, a rotation method based on the semester can also be adopted. The overall average opportunity and treatment for the three years of junior high school are still the same.

    Of course, it is difficult to implement this method universally because the school buildings and equipment conditions of each school are not the same. Taking the municipal middle schools in the city as an example, some schools have appropriately sized playgrounds, auditoriums, libraries, reading rooms, and dormitories; some schools are very small, and students touch each other when raising their hands and feet during morning exercises. As for reasonably sized auditoriums, reading rooms, and dormitories, there is even less to talk about. Therefore, schools implementing this enrollment method must have certain school buildings and equipment. Secondly, in schools implementing this method, either class A is in class or class B is in class all day long, and the opportunity for school-wide gatherings and activities at the same time is relatively small. Therefore, we believe that the school's administrative leadership should make full use of the weekly meeting time, and the student union and the Communist Youth League should use the time after school in the afternoon for activities. For example, schools implementing the "two classes one classroom" method should make full use of the time after school on Saturday afternoons. Otherwise, they can only hold local activities in batches according to the specific situation of each class. This should be noted. The advantage of the method of having five lessons in half a day is that classroom teaching and extracurricular activities are concentrated separately, which allows for more planned and reasonable allocation of time. In particular, concentrating classes in the morning can make students full of energy and improve learning results. The disadvantage is that students are prone to fatigue and hunger after the third lesson. Therefore, attention should be paid to students' breaks after the third lesson, which can be appropriately extended to 30 minutes to facilitate students having snacks. For the activity time outside of classroom teaching for each class, the academic affairs office should plan to allocate it, and teachers should effectively guide students' extracurricular homework and self-study. Otherwise, a noisy phenomenon will occur after class, which will not only affect the classes of other students, but also deprive students of the opportunity for extracurricular activities and self-study. In addition, such a change cancels the practice of no classes on Saturday afternoons, students' seats are always rotating, and classrooms cannot be fixed. Teachers and students will inevitably feel unaccustomed and inconvenienced in the short term, which is to be expected. But after a long time, everyone will get used to it.

    Compared with "night classes", what are the advantages of this method?

    We believe that it first solves the ideological problems of teachers, students, and students' parents, because although "night classes" were later changed to afternoon classes, or strived to have classes in the morning, there were differences in treatment compared with day classes. In addition, the publicity and mobilization work was not done well at the beginning of the opening, and the ideological problem was very serious. For example, the heads of some schools always believed that "night classes are not formal", were afraid of trouble, and were unwilling to accept this task. After the opening of classes, many teachers did not pay enough attention to the "night classes", and when they encountered unsatisfactory phenomena, they said: "Who told you to be students in night classes." Therefore, students in "night classes" generally had a sense of inferiority and did not study with peace of mind. In particular, there were few opportunities for day and night class students to participate in common activities, and all the school's systems were mainly formulated based on the situation of day classes, so disunity often occurred between day and night class students. As for the parents of the students, they generally believed that "night classes" were remedial in nature, "and we will transfer schools next year if we have the opportunity". Now, after the implementation of the new enrollment plan, there is no distinction between students, and the treatment after enrollment is equal. The basis for the so-called ideological problem no longer exists.

    Secondly, this is a more economical and effective solution to the enrollment problem of senior primary school graduates, and it implements the policy of overcoming difficulties with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods. Because, by doing so, one classroom plays the role of two classrooms, and two classrooms play the role of three classrooms. In other words, under the existing classrooms and equipment conditions, we can enroll twice as many or one-third more students. In addition, we can unify leadership and implement a set of systems (in the past, day and night classes had a separate administrative leadership method, and schools with "night classes" had an additional "night class teacher" in addition to the original organizational structure of the day class, who was responsible for night class work).

    Of course, this plan still has shortcomings in some places. For example, the dismissal time in the afternoon is later, and sometimes there are five consecutive lessons, and the teaching effect may not be as good as in the morning; there are few opportunities for students to participate in unified activities, and the leadership may sometimes not be able to take care of them, which may cause problems in unity; the working hours of teachers and staff are extended, and the amount of work per day is increased, which may affect their lesson preparation or rest. But under the current situation, there is no better way to solve the enrollment problem of senior primary school students. As long as everyone uses their brains and finds ways in the actual teaching process, the above-mentioned difficulties are not completely insurmountable.

    用革命办法解决北京市高小毕业生的升学问题
    王宜民
    根据最近的统计，今年北京市城郊区高小毕业生的总数为一万九千五百七十五人，再加上外埠来京投考的学生人数和本市历年失学青年的升学数字，今年升入初中一年级的学生人数，当在两万人以上（因某种原因不能升学者除外）。但是，本市初中一年级的现有收容量，是与这一要求不相称的：总计北京公私立中学的招生班数共二百二十七班，合一万一千三百五十人，那就是说，约半数的高小毕业生的升学问题无法解决。这是摆在北京市教育工作者面前的一个重大课题。当然，我们要在今天国家的财政经济条件许可的情况下，争取各校能够适当修建一部分校舍，增加一些班次，但数字是不可能很大的。
    去年秋季统一招生时，为了尽量照顾和解决高小毕业生的升学困难，曾参照东北教育部所拟“普通中学附设夜间班暂行实施办法”，充分利用现有校舍和设备条件，开办过十七个夜间班，解决了部分学生的升学问题。一年来，经过各校领导方面的共同努力，克服了不少困难，将夜间班改为日间班或是下午半日班，尽可能地在日间班的空堂里安排功课。然而可安排的空堂总是有限的，班次一增加，就将无空可插。
    现在，根据开办夜间班的初步经验，我们提出“两班一教室”和“三班两教室”的办法，争取全部解决今年高小毕业生的升学问题。
    我们认为，这个办法是完全可能实施的。两班使用一个教室的办法，每周各上课三十一节，除体育每周两节属于操场活动不占教室，和音乐课可占用音乐教室或礼堂以外，其余全部课程，甲乙两个班可以轮换占用一教室，并且上下午的上课时间都是均等的。同时，学校在具体安排课程表时，就可以按照功课性质的不同，有计划地将语文、数理等科排在上午，其他像史地、美术等科排在下午。为了尽量避免两班学生更换使用教室的频繁现象，上下午可由一班占用，或一班连用二节或三节。三班使用两个教室的办法，每周各上课三十一节，甲、乙、丙三班每周除体育两节属于操场活动不占教室，音乐课可占用音乐教室或礼堂外，其余全部课程均为二十八节，每个班上下午占用教室的机会也是均等的，即上午每周二十节，下午八节。不过，在具体使用方面，以甲、乙两班为主，各占用一个固定教室，丙班则分在两个教室上课，有计划地插空按排，占用两个教室的总节数和甲、乙两班还是相等的。同时，为了使各班享用固定教室的机会趋于均等，还可以采用以学期为单位的轮换办法，初中三个学年，总平均的机会和待遇还是一样的。
    如果要普遍施行这个办法，当然是有困难的。因为，各校的校舍和设备条件不尽相同。即以本市市立中学而论，有的学校有适当规模的操场、礼堂、图书馆、阅览室和宿舍；有的学校十分狭小，学生上早操时，一举手一投足就要相碰，至于相当规模的礼堂、阅览室、宿舍等，就更谈不到了。所以，实施这一招生办法的学校，必须具有一定的校舍和设备。其次，施行这个办法的学校，整天里不是甲班上课，就是乙班上课，在同一时间内全校性的集会和活动的机会是比较少的。因此我们认为，学校行政领导方面要充分利用周会时间，学生会和青年团要利用下午下课后的时间进行活动，如实行“两班一教室”的学校，就要充分利用星期六下午完课后的时间，否则只有根据各班的具体情况，分批举行局部性的活动。这是应该注意的。关于半天上五节课的办法，好处是课堂教学和课外活动分别集中，可以更有计划地合理地支配时间，特别是上午集中上课，可以使同学的精神饱满，学习效果好；缺点是：学生上到第三节后，易于疲劳和饥饿，因此，应该注意同学在第三节课结束后的课间休息，可适当地把它延长到三十分钟，让同学有吃点心的方便。对于每班课堂教学以外的活动时间，教导处应该有计划地加以支配，由教师切实指导同学的课外作业和自习，否则在下课后就会引起乱嘈嘈的现象，不但影响别班同学的上课，而且使同学失掉课外活动和自习的机会。此外，这样一个变革，取消了星期六下午不上课的惯例，同学的座位总在轮换着，教室也不能固定下来，在短期内师生一定会感到不习惯和某些不方便，这是可以预料到的。但是时间久了，大家自会习惯的。
    这个办法，比起“夜间班”来，究竟有那些优点呢？
    我们认为，它首先解决了师生和同学家长的思想问题，因为“夜间班”虽然在后来改为下午上课，或争取到上午也上课，但是和日班比较起来在待遇上是有差别的。再加以在开办之初，宣传动员工作做得不够，思想问题是很严重的。例如，某些学校的负责人总是认为“夜间班不正规”，怕麻烦，不愿接受这一任务。开班后很多教员对“夜间班”重视不够，碰到不满意的现象就说：“谁叫你们做夜间班的学生呢。”因此，“夜间班”的学生普遍地有着自卑感，学习不安心。特别是日、夜班学生共同活动的机会少，而且学校的一切制度主要是根据日班的情况制订的，因而日夜班同学间往往发生不团结的现象。至于同学家长，则普遍认为“夜间班”是补习性质，“等明年有机会再转学”。现在，新的招生方案实行后，同学间就没有区别，入学后的待遇又是均等的。过去所谓思想问题的根据，根本不存在了。
    其次，这是一个比较经济而有效的解决高小毕业生升学问题的方案，它贯彻了以革命精神和革命办法来克服困难的方针。因为，这样做，一个教室就发挥了两个教室的作用，两个教室发挥了三个教室的作用。换句话说：在现有的教室和设备条件下就可以多招一倍或三分之一的学生人数。此外，还可以统一领导，实行一套制度（过去日、夜班各有一套行政领导的办法，设有“夜间班”的学校除日班原有的机构编制外，另设有“夜间班主任”一人，专管夜班工作）。
    当然，这一方案在某些地方还是有缺点的，例如，下午下课的时间较晚，而且有时一连上五节课，教学效果可能不如上午好；学生统一活动的机会少，再加领导方面有时照顾不到，可能在团结方面发生问题；教职员的工作时间延长，每日工作的分量加重，可能影响到他们的备课或休息。但在目前的情况下，没有更好的解决高小学生升学问题的办法。只要大家在实际教学过程中随时动脑筋，想办法，上述的困难，也不是完全不能克服的。
