Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on July 1st. After a lengthy discussion on procedural matters at the morning session, the Council adopted an agenda that included two items: the Soviet proposal to recommend the admission of new member states to the United Nations, and the US proposal to investigate the accusations of the use of bacteriological weapons.

Although the Soviet proposal was submitted first, the US-UK bloc decided to place the issue raised by the US delegation as the first item on the agenda.

Subsequently, Security Council President Jebb (British representative) suggested discussing the US proposal, attempting to set aside the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the US proposal. Malik demanded that the Security Council discuss and vote on the Soviet proposal before substantively discussing the US proposal. He emphasized that without the participation of representatives from China and North Korea, the Security Council could not substantively discuss this important issue.

At the afternoon session, the US-UK bloc again rejected the Soviet proposal. Representatives of the US-UK bloc offered various excuses to justify their opposition to the Soviet proposal. Malik revealed the reason for their negative vote, stating that the US delegation had shown the world that it feared hearing the opinions of the representatives of the Chinese and Korean peoples in the Security Council, as these representatives would present concrete facts proving that the US military was conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. Malik pointed out that the purpose of the US proposal was to divert attention from the fact that the US was using bacteriological weapons and to conceal the US's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare. The US government was using its customary tactic: first inflict damage on other countries, and then propose an "on-the-spot" investigation to gather intelligence. Various international organizations, including the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, have already proven that the US is conducting bacteriological warfare.

Malik further emphasized that the US had consistently refused to condemn the method of bacteriological warfare when discussing the issue. Such a fact could only indicate that the US hoped to use this method of warfare arbitrarily and without any constraints. This fact also explained why the US opposed the Soviet proposal calling on all countries around the world to support the Geneva Protocol and why it refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol.

Malik said that it would be impossible to discuss the US proposal to investigate the use of bacteriological weapons without the participation of representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet representative had decided not to participate in the discussion of the US proposal without the participation of representatives from the two peoples of China and North Korea, and had decided to vote against the US proposal.

    安理会美英集团害怕中朝代表正义控诉竟否决苏联提案
    马立克宣布反对美国提案并决不参加讨论
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会于七月一日举行会议。上午会议经过长时间的关于程序问题的讨论以后，通过了包括两项问题的议程：苏联所提出的关于建议准许新会员国参加联合国的问题和美国所提出的关于调查对使用细菌武器的谴责的问题。
    虽然苏联的提案是先提出来的，可是美英集团却决定把美国代表团所提出的问题列为议程的第一项。
    接着安全理事会主席杰伯（英国代表）建议讨论美国的提案，想把苏联所提出的关于邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论美国提案的提案撇在一边。马立克要求安全理事会在从实质上讨论美国提案以前，先讨论并表决苏联的这个提案。他着重指出：没有中国和北朝鲜的代表参加，安全理事会就不可能从实质上讨论这个重要问题。
    在下午会议上，美英集团又否决了苏联的提案。美英集团的代表提出了种种藉口，为他们反对苏联提案辩解。马立克揭露他们投票反对的理由说：美国代表团已经向全世界表明自己害怕在安全理事会中听取中朝两国人民代表的意见，因为这些代表会提出具体的事实，证明美军在朝鲜进行细菌战。马立克指出：美国提案的目的在于转移人们的注意，使人们不注意美国使用细菌武器的事实，并掩饰美国拒绝批准禁止进行细菌战的日内瓦议定书的态度。美国政府使用它的惯技：先对别的国家造成损害，然后再建议进行“现地”调查，以便搜集情报。各种国际组织，包括国际民主法律工作者协会在内，都已经证明了美国正在进行细菌战。
    马立克又着重指出：美国在讨论细菌战问题的时候，始终拒绝斥责这种作战方法。这样一个事实只能够表明：美国希望不受任何约束地任意使用这种作战方法。这个事实也就说明了美国所以反对苏联所提出的号召全世界各国支持日内瓦议定书的提案，所以拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的原因。
    马立克说：如果没有中国代表和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加，就不可能讨论美国所提出的调查使用细菌武器问题的提案。马立克最后说：苏联代表决定不参加没有中朝两国人民代表参加的关于美国提案的讨论，并决定投票反对美国提案。
