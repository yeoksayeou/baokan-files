    The policy of the American imperialists in pursuing world domination is currently encountering huge obstacles. One of these obstacles is the rapid development of the Japanese revolutionary movement.

    The May Day demonstrations of 1952 demonstrated the level to which the Japanese revolutionary movement had risen. A total of four million people participated in the May Day demonstrations held in four hundred locations throughout the country. The enemy organized attacks on the demonstrations everywhere, deploying powerful armed police forces under the command of American officers for this purpose. But this attempt to crush the demonstrations was clearly a failure. In Tokyo, American officers directed ten thousand armed police to attack the May Day demonstration rally in People's Square. One hundred thousand demonstrators resolutely fought back against the police, resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides. The resolute resistance of the Japanese people has made the U.S. military's situation in Korea even more hopeless, accelerated the political, economic, and organizational collapse of the United States in Japan, and further confused the camp of the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices – the Japanese reactionaries.

    All of this shows that the Japanese revolutionary movement has become a serious obstacle to the American aggressive policy in the Far East, and shows that the Japanese revolutionary movement is playing a significant role in this regard. This is the reason why the movement has received widespread international support.

    The current rise of the Japanese revolutionary movement is the result of the thirty years of tenacious struggle by the Japanese Communist Party.

    Today, on the thirtieth anniversary of the Party, it is necessary for our Party to review its past activities in order to learn from them, thereby helping the Party to develop further.

    I

    The great Russian October Socialist Revolution had a significant impact on the development of the world revolutionary movement. Under its influence, communist parties in various countries were established one after another. In recent years, communist parties in many countries have celebrated their thirtieth anniversaries. The Japanese Communist Party, founded on July 15, 1922, is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary this year.

    From 1900, the workers' trade union movement in Japan began to develop under the leadership of the great Katayama Sen. At one time, this movement was strangled by the militarist Tenno system government.

    However, the great Russian October Socialist Revolution revived the worker movement, the peasant movement, and the student movement. In the summer of 1918, the "Rice Riots" occurred in Japan - a rice-grabbing movement by hungry people.

    In early 1922, Moscow hosted a conference of representatives from the peoples of the Far East. After this conference, the communist groups scattered throughout Japan at that time were unified under the leadership of Comrade Katayama Sen into the Japanese Communist Party. The Communist Party announced that the purpose of its program was to overthrow the Tenno system and establish a democratic republic.

    In 1927, the Communist Party enriched this simple program so that the Party could expand its influence among the masses. After smashing the economist-liquidationists headed by Yamakawa and the leftist groups such as Fukumoto who attempted to detach the Party from the masses with petty-bourgeois abstract theories, the Japanese Communist Party became the true vanguard of the working class. Its program included the following: overthrowing the Tenno system, abolishing the parasitic landlord land ownership system, returning the land to the peasants without compensation, a seven-hour workday, and the establishment of a worker-peasant united government. Under the leadership of Comrade Watanabe Masanosuke, the Party relied on the support of the broad masses and bravely fought for the realization of this program.

    The great national liberation movements in the Far East, especially in China, which developed under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, have further sharpened the internal contradictions of the predatory Japanese imperialism, which survives by maintaining the Tenno system – the weakest link in the world imperialist system. It is precisely for this reason that the Japanese government further intensified its intervention in China after World War I. Japan's seizure of Manchuria in 1931 made it the first country to launch World War II.

    In order to carry out this war, the Japanese imperialists further strengthened their policy of oppressing the broad masses of the people. This was a combination of the fascist oppressive system and feudal remnants.

    The Communist Party was the first to be subjected to brutal suppression, and later this suppression was extended to all aspects of trade unions, peasant associations, student organizations, and even free cultural activities. The entire life, thought, and action of the people were bound by militarist slavery.

    This brutal suppression, which began as early as 1928, became increasingly severe as the war dragged on.

    Our Party did everything in its power to fight against this policy implemented for the benefit of the war of aggression. Regardless of the viciousness of the semi-feudal Tenno system rule, the Communist Party continued to organize anti-war groups in factories, mines, villages, and the army and navy, and persisted in the struggle.

    In the course of this fierce struggle, our Party's outstanding leader, Ichikawa Shoichi, was murdered by the enemy.

    From the founding of the Communist Party to the defeat of Japanese imperialism in 1945, the activities of our Party were always illegal and often subjected to savage persecution during these twenty-three years. Therefore, the number of Party members never exceeded one thousand. However, despite this, the Party still laid a certain foundation among workers, peasants, and progressive students for the further development of the revolutionary movement led by the working class. The extremely rapid development of the Communist Party, which now has hundreds of thousands of members and enjoys the support of the broad masses, proves this point.

    II

    On August 15, 1945, the Japanese Tenno announced Japan's unconditional surrender in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation. Predatory Japanese imperialism suffered a complete defeat, and the Tenno, who had previously been regarded as a god, was forced to renounce his divine status. The "Public Security Preservation Law" and other fascist laws were abolished. On October 10, 1945, many Japanese comrades, led by leading comrades of the Communist Party, were finally released after eighteen years of imprisonment.

    The Communist Party was given the opportunity to exist legally for the first time, and immediately launched activities. In its program, the Communist Party demanded the abolition of the Tenno system, the confiscation of parasitic landlord land ownership and the transfer of land to the peasants, the establishment of people's management of monopoly capital, and the establishment of a people's democratic republic. For this reason, the Party was immediately subjected to a frenzied attack by the reactionaries – especially the remaining fascist groups – who did not hesitate to use terrorist methods to attack them in order to intimidate the Communists. Social Democratic Party members colluded with capitalists to launch attacks on the Communist Party, betraying the interests of the working class. But the working class disregarded everything and actively supported the Communist Party, and the struggle of the working class was almost entirely carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party. For this reason, a vigorous strike struggle unfolded in Japan in 1946. In the summer and autumn of 1946, the Seamen's Union, the Railway Workers' Union, the Electrical Workers' Union, and other unions waged a victorious struggle, demanding higher wages, an eight-hour workday, and the implementation of a labor-management collective contract system, etc. There were no working-class organizations in Japan during the war. By the beginning of 1947, the number of workers and employees organized in trade unions had reached four million.

    In the course of this struggle, our Party not only successfully led the strike struggle, but also fought for the large-scale establishment of working-class management of industry. This management was necessary because the capitalists, in view of the unfavorable domestic political and economic situation, had stopped production. In this situation, the workers had to resist, not only by striking, but also by managing the enterprises. The masses, suffering from a lack of necessities, welcomed this management.

    The tactic of working-class management of production was subjected to a concerted and frenzied attack by capitalists and social democrats, but despite this, the tactic was successful. This experience is undoubtedly of great significance for the further development of the revolutionary situation. Precisely because the working class relied on production management, they were able to wage strike struggles victoriously and fight confidently for the seizure of power.

    On February 1, 1947, 2.6 million workers in many industrial sectors decided to declare a general strike. The government and capitalists were completely at a loss in the face of the immense power of the working class. Although they avoided this strike with the help of MacArthur headquarters troops, the workers still obtained double wages through negotiations and achieved the demands for an eight-hour workday and the implementation of a collective contract system.

    In the statement issued by Acheson in May 1946, the American imperialists completely exposed their anti-communist stance. They did everything in their power to put the reactionary Yoshida government in power. But before the general strike in February 1947, they did not dare to openly prohibit strikes. It was not until January 31, 1947, in view of the growing strength of the Communist Party's leadership and the increasing scale of the struggle waged by workers relying on production management, that the American authorities issued an order prohibiting the general strike. From that time on, they have constantly expanded their actions, disregarding the Potsdam Proclamation. The order prohibiting the general strike was issued in February 1947, which was the first step in establishing the current colonial regime in Japan.

    Faced with the order prohibiting the general strike in February 1947, our Party took a step back in order to strengthen its ties with the masses led by the working class. At this time, the Communist Party's leadership among the working class was strong, but its leadership among the peasants, especially among students and intellectuals, was still weak. At this time, the number of Party members was not large enough – only a little over 30,000.

    Later, the Party concentrated all its efforts on strengthening Party organizations and their influence in various mass organizations; the Party repelled various enemy provocations and attacks, and steadily built up its revolutionary forces.

    Prior to this, the Party had to some extent underestimated the importance of working in mass organizations, but later the Party adopted a firm policy to strengthen the Party's influence in various cooperatives, among cultural and artistic workers, in small and medium-sized manufacturers' organizations, in central and local governments, in police stations, and other organs that persecuted the people. The purpose of doing this was to ensure that the Party's activities were not limited to the working class alone, but to expand the Party's activities to peasants, students, intellectuals, small and medium-sized manufacturers and merchants, thereby establishing a broad national democratic united front. The Party also tried to expand its activities among youth and women.

    Previously, most of the Party's newspapers and periodicals were published centrally. At this time, the Party passed a resolution stipulating that all local organs of the Party should publish newspapers and periodicals. By the end of 1949, Party organizations had published a total of 5,000 kinds of newspapers and magazines. All Party organizations also established Party training classes. In addition to the central cadre school for training leading cadres, all local Party committees also ran schools. We used this method to try to raise the educational level of Party members. While fighting to realize the daily needs of the masses and protect their interests, we strengthened the Party's ties with the masses, making the Party stronger in the face of the various suppressions that the enemy might carry out.

    As a result of doing this, the Party's strength greatly increased.

    Our Party also used the method of uniting the left wings of the Socialist Party and the Labor-Peasant Party to carry out the work of absorbing new Party members. As a result, the Communist Party grew much stronger, and by the end of 1949, the number of Party members had exceeded 200,000.

    After the order prohibiting the general strike was issued in February 1947, Communists and other progressive elements were expelled in large numbers from trade unions and peasant organizations. In order to achieve this goal, Communists were accused of various unfounded crimes, and various means of violence and bribery and various divisive activities were used to weaken the Party's influence among the masses. In order to cope with this situation, our Party, while trying to avoid splits in mass organizations, used various methods to strengthen the Party's influence – even trying to strengthen the Party's influence in organizations led by reactionaries or neutral elements. In this way, despite the resistance of the self-seeking opportunist leaders in these organizations, the united action movement in mass organizations led by the Communist Party was strengthened, the ties between workers and peasants were strengthened, and the tactics of the united front were expanded. Although the number of members of various trade unions affiliated with the Industrial Union Conference and other left-wing mass organizations has greatly decreased, the united front tactic has been widely and successfully applied in mass organizations, and the strength of the Communist Party has not decreased, but has continued to increase.

    In the House of Representatives election in January 1949, our Party, despite the barbaric persecution of the Yoshida government and the American occupation authorities, still received three million votes and won thirty-five seats in the Diet. In the course of the election campaign, the Party's influence in the localities also greatly increased, and many Communists were elected as mayors, village heads, and city councilors, whereas previously there was almost no representation for them at all.

    The work that the Party had done in various cultural and scientific organizations and organs, which had been very weak, was now greatly expanded.

    But during this period, along with obtaining these achievements, two kinds of opportunism arose. One kind of opportunism was manifested in the fifteenth plenary session of the Central Committee held in the spring of 1949. Those who committed this opportunist error underestimated the reactionary essence of the American occupation regime, and believed that it was possible to achieve revolutionary victory in the Diet by peaceful means.

    Another kind of opportunism was manifested in September 1949. Those who advocated this opportunism believed that the Japanese government was completely in the hands of the American imperialists, and that the Yoshida government and other central and local government organs were merely tools of the American imperialists. Therefore, they argued that the Party's main task at present was to only struggle against the American occupation forces, without mentioning the struggle against the Yoshida government. These opportunists argued that the Party should concentrate all its efforts on widely publicizing this task among the masses and mobilize the masses to immediately fight to promote the withdrawal of American troops.

    As a result of discussions within the Party, the Party's right-wing opportunism was overcome. Articles published in the magazines "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" and "People's Daily" that profoundly analyzed the situation in Japan and the Party's situation greatly helped the Party in this regard. The eighteenth enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee held in January 1950 unanimously decided that the Party's current task was to fight to end the American occupation regime and overthrow the domestic reactionary forces represented by the Yoshida government. But this decision did not make a very clear assessment of the situation in Japan at that time, and did not determine the main revolutionary actions that were adapted to the domestic situation. The Party continued to be harmed by the wavering attitude of left-wing opportunism, which later formed sectarian groups including Trotskyites and various other wavering elements.

    Needless to say, the emergence of these sectarian groups facilitated the attacks of the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries on the Communist Party. They took advantage of the weaknesses inside the Party to promote divisive activities within the Party. As a result, the number of Party members temporarily decreased, hindering the further growth of the Party.

    At this time, it was necessary for the Party to formulate a new program to help eliminate differences within the Party, open up a new situation, and allow the Party to develop further.

    III

    One of the main problems that the Party's leadership lacked a clear understanding of was whether post-war Japan was an imperialist country or whether it had become a colonial appendage. The Party's leadership believed that Japan was a military imperialist country just as it had been before the war, although its normal development had been interrupted. Indeed, the Party's leadership had also pointed out that due to the American occupation, Japan was in a subordinate position, and therefore it was an important issue to liberate Japan from the occupation rule. However, the Party's leadership did not clearly define the nature of this revolution as a colonial, appendage revolution, the principles of which Comrade Stalin had thoroughly explained. The Communist Party's leadership had put forward the task of national liberation, and believed that under these circumstances, the national bourgeoisie could become an active factor in the liberation struggle. We have worked very hard to study this issue, but we still have not fully clarified this issue.

    The significance of the new program lies in the fact that it removes this ambiguity, stipulating that the nature of the revolution that is about to come in Japan is a revolution of a subordinate country, a national liberation democratic revolution.

    The Communist Party's new program is gradually becoming the program of the entire people. Under its banner, many strong organizations have been established to resist American imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces. This is because our Party's new program truly represents the interests of the people and points them to the correct path to fight for a better life.

    Beginning in the autumn of 1949, our Party, in addition to its previous legal activities, also switched to another mode of activity that conformed to the new situation. After the end of the war, our Party had engaged in large-scale legal activities, and on this basis, our Party became a mass party and made great progress in its development. But in order to deal with the enemy's malicious attacks and provocations, and in order to enable the Party to develop further, we needed a new organizational system to facilitate the necessary actions.

    Due to switching to this new tactic, our Party put forward a slogan: "Rely on the people's trust to fight," which means that we must never forget that we must maintain close ties with the masses. In this way, the Party was able to preserve its organization by relying on the strong power of the people. Under the leadership of the Party, the masses quickly established a series of resistance organizations, which are repelling the enemy's attacks.

    It is precisely because of adopting this new tactic that we were able to thwart the conspiracies of the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries, who have been doing everything in their power to destroy the Communist Party since 1950, and use the opposition within the Party to achieve this goal. This tactic has also enabled us to ensure the further development and consolidation of the Party.

    The American occupation authorities and the Japanese reactionary government of Yoshida, taking advantage of the conditions of the occupation regime, prohibited members of the Central Committee of the Party and leaders of the "Akahata" newspaper from participating in public life. They "purged" the most active people in the trade unions and the Diet, and ordered the banning of nearly two thousand kinds of progressive newspapers and magazines, including the central organ of the Communist Party, the "Akahata" newspaper, and they closed down the printing houses of these newspapers and magazines. They assassinated or imprisoned tens of thousands of activists, and falsely accused them of various unfounded crimes. But despite this, the revolutionary forces are growing stronger and more consolidated, which proves that our Party has defeated the enemy's policy of suppression.

    Due to the adoption of the new program, which clearly put forward the goals of the Party, the entire Party has invested in more active work.

    After the signing of the San Francisco separate "peace treaty" with Japan, the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," and the subsequent so-called "administrative agreement," it has become very clear that the meaning of these treaties is to extend the U.S. military occupation of Japan, enslave the Japanese people, and turn Japan into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union, China, Korea, Vietnam, and other Far Eastern countries.

    The Yoshida reactionary government's statement, in violation of international agreements, ending the activities of the Soviet delegation in Japan, and its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique for the purpose of conducting a war of aggression, have further exposed the aggressive conspiracies of the American imperialists.

    The answer of the working class, peasants, students, and intellectuals and small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants from other strata is to rise up and wage a resolute struggle in the spirit of the Communist Party's new program.

    This powerful people's resistance movement is most clearly manifested in the actions of the trade unions, which unite the masses of the people around them. From the end of 1951 to May 1952, the trade unions conducted several large-scale strikes and organized demonstrations, in which 1.5 million to 4 million people participated. In this way, the trade unions powerfully struck at the fascist policy and caused panic within the enemy camp.

    Until now, the Japanese revolutionary movement has still lacked full cooperation with international forces. But since we adopted the new program and began to implement it, this cooperation has been strengthened. Brotherly Communist Parties and progressive groups in many countries have given us tremendous moral help on the issue of the Korean War, on the relationship with the Soviet Union and New China, on the struggle against American aggressive policies, on the further development of our Party, and on other issues related to the lives of our people.

    Of particular significance in this regard is the New Year's telegram from J.V. Stalin to the Japanese people. This telegram not only strengthened the international ties of the Japanese people, but also immeasurably helped them to intensify their struggle against the anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies of the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionary forces, and at the same time helped them to strive for the victorious realization of the tasks put forward in the Communist Party's new program.

    IV

    The "land reform" implemented under the orders of the American occupation army is a complete fraud.

    The right-wing of the Socialist Party and the "left"-leaning adventurers say that due to this reform, the work of allocating arable land to the peasants has been completed, and the only problem is that current agriculture is unprofitable, and therefore there is not enough capital invested in agriculture.

    Based on this reasoning, they ridicule our Party's land policy, saying that it is ridiculous for us to put forward the demand to implement revolutionary land reform.

    At that time, we were not able to give a decisive blow to the right-wing of the Socialist Party and the "left"-leaning adventurers on this issue. Although we put forward the demand for revolutionary land reform, and at the same time insisted on satisfying the other various demands of the peasants due to the different conditions in different regions of the country, we did not correctly link these partial demands with the basic demand – the implementation of revolutionary land reform. Therefore, we were not able to win over the peasants, especially the poor peasants who are the main force of the peasant movement, to our side.

    Our Party's new program completely eliminated this ambiguity on the land issue, pointing out that the development of agriculture and the improvement of the lives of the peasants can only be realized on the basis of implementing revolutionary land reform and completely eliminating the feudal remnants in the lives of the people. In reality, the "land reform" implemented under the orders of the American occupation army did not give any benefits to the middle peasants and poor peasants. According to this kind of land reform, the peasants must pay a large amount of money for the land they receive. The peasants are trapped and bear this heavy economic burden, and as a result, the land they receive quickly falls into the hands of the landlords and rich peasants, and the peasants are even poorer than before.

    This "land reform" left the forests and wasteland to the landlords. The right-wing of the Socialist Party and the "left"-leaning adventurers say that we have no reason to blame the government for this state of affairs, because in the future these forests and wasteland will be completely handed over to the government. However, in Japan, arable land only accounts for 16 percent of the entire land area. Without handing over the forests and wasteland to the peasants, any reform is useless to the peasants. When the peasants use the forests and wasteland for animal husbandry, firewood, and fertilizer, they must pay a large amount of money. In this way, the rule of the landlords and rich peasants is established in the countryside.

    Currently, under the protection of powerful resistance organizations, the peasants continue to wage an organized struggle, demanding that the forests and wasteland be handed over to them without compensation.

    The "land reform" also did not touch the irrigation and soil improvement equipment, without which the peasants cannot improve cultivation.

    Therefore, this "land reform" not only did not eliminate the feudal remnants in the countryside, but also helped to preserve the rule of the reactionary forces. The "Liberal" Party, which violates national interests, is still able to occupy a majority in the Diet precisely because it firmly relies on the deep-rooted feudal remnants in the countryside. Therefore, without implementing revolutionary land reform, it is not only impossible to fundamentally improve the living conditions of the peasants, but it is also impossible to further develop agricultural production. Without developing agricultural production, it is also impossible to improve the lives of the working class and the entire people. Our people, as before, are forced to live under the Tenno system, are still enslaved by the Americans, endure the pain of unemployment, and serve as cannon fodder for war. It is precisely in order to achieve these goals that the American imperialists are implementing the deceitful so-called "land reform."

    After the Communist Party's new program was published, the demands for implementing revolutionary land reform and for handing over forests, wasteland, and irrigation equipment to the peasants became especially widespread in the countryside.

    In addition to stipulating that the land issue should be resolved in a revolutionary way, the new program also stipulates that the semi-feudal labor exploitation should be abolished, trade unions should have freedom, the material conditions of the people should be thoroughly improved, and the struggle to realize these demands should be closely integrated with the struggle of the peasants. In this way, the struggle to effectively implement the new program has consolidated the alliance between workers and peasants. This struggle has also attracted students, intellectuals, handicraftsmen, small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and merchants who are also suffering from the American occupation and the rule of the Yoshida government to the side of the working class. All these forces are united within the national liberation democratic united front with the worker-peasant alliance as the main force. These revolutionary forces are fighting against the American occupation army and the Japanese reactionary forces, relying on various resistance organizations.

    It is precisely because all the revolutionary forces have been effectively consolidated in accordance with the new program that these revolutionary forces have launched a large-scale offensive since the end of 1951.

    V

    Due to the American imperialists launching a war of aggression in Korea, the shackles that the American imperialists have placed on Japan have become even heavier. The Americans have begun to extract most of the materials needed for this war from Japan. Therefore, there is an extreme shortage of many daily necessities in this country. The protracted nature of the Korean War has made the economic crisis even more serious. The textile industry, which Japanese capitalists are proud of, has recently had to cut its production capacity by 40 percent. This is a heavy blow to many small and medium-sized enterprises related to the textile industry. More than 100 large companies with capital of more than 10 million yen have completely gone bankrupt. The economic crisis has also swept through other industrial sectors, from the chemical industry to the machine manufacturing industry. At present, the economic crisis has penetrated into the steel industry – the core of the war industry. The number of people who are completely unemployed and partially unemployed is more than 18 million. Overall, the people are living an intolerable life.

    The Moscow International Economic Conference showed that the capitalists of many countries (including the United States), as a result of the economic shift of these countries to a war footing, are facing the danger of bankruptcy, and they hope to live in peace with the Soviet Union, New China, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and develop trade with these countries. Many Japanese capitalists also have this opinion. It is expected that many representatives will participate in the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September. Three Japanese capitalists who recently participated in the Moscow International Economic Conference represented Japan at the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference.

    In order to cover up their failures in Korea, the American imperialists are conducting germ warfare and using brutal retaliatory measures against prisoners of war. However, after these atrocities were exposed, the Japanese people's hatred of the American imperialists has increased even more; their struggle against imperialist war, for the rapid withdrawal of the occupation forces, and for national independence has developed even more strongly. This increasingly strong resistance from the masses is shattering the American colonial rule in Japan, making it increasingly difficult for the American imperialists to stand their ground. At present, the American policy of establishing world domination is suffering defeat in all countries. In order to avoid this failure, they have used fascist violent means. But despite their use of these fascist means, even in the United States itself, there have been large-scale strikes. The economic crisis of the capitalist countries that rely on the United States is deepening. All of this makes it more difficult for the American imperialists to enslave our people with naked violent means.

    In the face of this serious situation, American monopoly capital and its political agents have no choice but to make extensive use of gangster organizations and use even more barbaric fascist rule methods in Japan. But this only aggravates the crisis in Japan and makes American agents feel even more isolated in the face of the people. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for American imperialism to maintain its spiritual and political foundation – the Yoshida government.

    Because of this, the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionary forces are very afraid of the struggle of the broad masses for national independence and freedom and for safeguarding peace. No fascist suppression can now suppress the increasingly strong people's revolutionary movement. At present, the Japanese revolutionary movement has close ties with the world peace camp. Moreover, because this connection involves many daily economic issues, this connection is becoming more and more solid.

    It can be seen from this that the courageous advance of the Japanese people is irresistible.

    VI

    Due to the specific implementation of the new program, there can no longer be any opposition within our Party. Most of the opposition elements – except for the Trotskyite "international faction," which now only has a very small number of adventurers left – have admitted their mistakes and returned to the Party ranks. Others are requesting permission to rejoin the Party. At present, the Party is developing on the basis of unified will and unified leadership. But we still have some shortcomings.

    For example, these shortcomings include: when holding certain strikes and demonstrations, we have not taken into account the actual demands and goals of the workers and peasants, but only based on the intentions of the leadership. Then, the leaders concentrate their efforts on strikes and demonstrations, and often do not pay enough attention to forms of struggle such as Diet elections and local authorities elections. Our task is to: persistently conduct class political training for Party members, master the art of coordinating legal work and underground work, overcome the shortcomings that still occur in our work, build all our activities on maintaining the confidence of the masses, and not fall behind the rapidly developing revolutionary struggle.

    In reviewing the activities of the Japanese Communist Party over the past thirty years, we particularly recognize the need to arm our Party with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and firmly follow the instructions of the great leader, the teacher of all working people, and the standard-bearer of peace, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

    The thought of Mao Zedong, which applies Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution and points out a new path for China, must also become our constant guide.

    Long live the thirtieth anniversary of the Japanese Communist Party!
    Down with imperialist war!
    Long live the independence, freedom, and peace of the Japanese people
    Long live the national liberation democratic revolution!
    Long live peace and cooperation with the Soviet Union and China and all other peace-loving countries!

    日本共产党的三十周年
    日本共产党中央委员会总书记  德田球一
    美帝国主义者追求世界统治权的政策，目前遇到了巨大的障碍。其中一个障碍是日本革命运动的迅速发展。
    一九五二年“五一”节示威运动说明了日本革命运动的水平已达到什么样的高度。在全国四百个地方分别举行的“五一”节示威，共有四百万人民参加。敌人到处对示威组织了进攻，为了达到这个目的，出动了美国军官指挥下的强大的武装警察部队。但是这种粉碎示威的企图，显然是失败了。在东京，美国军官指挥一万名武装警察，向人民广场上的“五一”节示威游行大会进攻。十万名示威群众坚决向警察还击，结果双方死伤数百人。日本人民的坚决反抗，使美军在朝鲜的处境更加没有希望，加速了美国在日本的政治、经济和组织的崩溃，并使美帝国主义者和他们的同谋犯——日本反动派阵营更加混乱。
    所有这一切都表明了：日本的革命运动已成为美国在远东的侵略政策的严重障碍，并且表明了日本的革命运动在这方面发挥了重大的作用。这个运动得到国际上普遍声援的原因，正在这里。
    目前日本革命运动的上涨，是日本共产党三十年来顽强斗争的结果。
    今天，在党的三十周年纪念日，我们党有必要回顾它过去的活动，以便从中学习，从而帮助党得到进一步的发展。
    一
    伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命对世界革命运动的发展起了重大影响。在它的影响下，各国共产党纷纷成立。最近几年来，许多国家的共产党都在庆祝它们的三十周年。一九二二年七月十五日创立的日本共产党在今年庆祝它的三十周年。
    从一九○○年起，工人阶级的工会运动在日本就在伟大的片山潜的领导下开始发展。有一个时候，这种运动曾被军国主义的天皇制政府所扼杀。
    但是，伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命使工人运动、农民和学生运动复活了。一九一八年夏天日本发生了“米骚动”——饥饿的老百姓的抢米运动。
    一九二二年初，莫斯科举行了远东各国人民的代表大会。这次大会以后，那时分散于日本各地的共产主义小组，在片山潜同志领导下统一为日本共产党。共产党宣布它的纲领的目的是推翻天皇制与建立民主共和国。
    一九二七年，共产党把这个简单的纲领充实起来，使党能扩大它在群众中的影响。日本共产党在粉碎了以山川为首的经济主义的取消派以及企图以小资产阶级的抽象理论使党脱离群众的福本等左倾集团以后，就成了工人阶级的真正的先锋队了。它的纲领包括下列几项：推翻天皇制、废除不劳而食的地主土地所有制、把土地无偿地归还农民、七小时工作日、成立工农联合政府。由于渡边政之辅同志的领导，党曾依靠广大群众的支持，勇敢地为实现这个纲领而斗争。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下发展起来的远东各国特别是中国的伟大民族解放运动，已使全世界帝国主义体系中脆弱的一环——借天皇制维持生存的掠夺的日本帝国主义的内部矛盾更加尖锐化了。正是由于这个缘故，日本政府才在世界第一次大战以后进一步加紧干涉中国。日本于一九三一年强占满洲，这使它成了第一个发动第二次世界大战的国家。
    为了进行这场战争，日本帝国主义者更加加强它的压迫人民大众的政策。这是法西斯的压迫制度与封建残余的结合。
    共产党首先受到残酷的镇压，以后这种镇压更扩及工会、农会、学生团体以至自由文化活动的各个方面。人民的全部生活、思想和行动都受到军国主义奴役的束缚。
    这种早在一九二八年就已开始的残酷镇压，随着战争的延长而愈来愈厉害了。
    我们党竭尽全力与这种为了侵略战争的利益而实行的政策进行斗争。共产党不顾半封建的天皇制统治的穷凶极恶，继续在工厂、矿山、乡村和陆、海军里面组织反战小组，坚持斗争。
    在这种激烈的斗争过程中，我们党的卓越的领袖市川正一被敌人杀害了。
    自从共产党成立到一九四五年日本帝国主义战败为止，这二十三年中，我们党的活动总是非法的，经常受到野蛮的迫害。因此，党员人数从来不曾超过一千人。然而，尽管如此，党仍在工人、农民、进步学生之中为进一步发展工人阶级领导的革命运动奠立了一定的基础。现在拥有数十万党员并获得广大群众支持的共产党的极为迅速的发展证明了这一点。
    二
    一九四五年八月十五日，日本天皇宣布日本遵照波茨坦公告无条件投降。掠夺性的日本帝国主义遭到了彻底的失败，以前被看做天神一样的天皇被迫放弃他的神位。“治安维持法”以及其他法西斯法律被废除。一九四五年十月十日，以共产党领导同志为首的许多日本同志在受了十八年的监禁以后终于得到释放。
    共产党第一次得到合法存在的机会，于是立即展开活动。共产党在它的纲领中要求废除天皇制，没收寄生的地主土地所有制，而把土地交给农民，确立人民对垄断资本的管理和建立一个人民民主共和国。由于这种缘故，党立即受到反动派——特别是残余的法西斯集团——的疯狂进攻，这些集团为了恫吓共产党人甚至不惜以恐怖手段对他们进攻。社会民主党分子和资本家勾结，向共产党发动进攻，出卖工人阶级的利益。但是工人阶级不顾一切，积极支持共产党，工人阶级的斗争几乎完全是在共产党领导下进行的。由于这种缘故，一九四六年日本展开了一场轰轰烈烈的罢工斗争。一九四六年夏季和秋季，海员工会、铁道工人工会、电气工人工会以及其他工会进行了一场胜利的斗争，要求提高工资，每日工作八小时，实行劳资集体合同制度等等。战时日本没有工人阶级组织。在一九四七年年初，组织在工会中的工人和职员已达四百万人。
    在进行这场斗争的过程中，我们党不但胜利地领导了罢工斗争，而且还为大规模建立工人阶级对工业的管理而奋斗。这种管理是必要的，因为资本家鉴于国内政治局势与经济局势对他们不利，已在停止生产。在这种情况下，工人不得不进行反抗，反抗的方式不单单是罢工，而且还要管理企业。因缺乏生活必需品而感受痛苦的群众欢迎这种管理。
    工人阶级管理生产的战术受到资本家和社会民主党人联合一致的疯狂进攻，但是尽管这样，这个战术还是成功了。这种经验对革命形势的进一步发展无疑是有很大意义的。正因为工人阶级依靠生产管理，他们就能够胜利地进行罢工斗争，并满怀信心地为夺取政权而斗争。
    一九四七年二月一日，许多工业部门的二百六十万工人决定宣布总罢工。在工人阶级强大无比的力量面前，政府和资本家完全不知所措了。虽然他们在麦克阿瑟总部军队的帮助下避免了这次罢工，但是工人仍然通过谈判得到加倍的工资，实现了每日工作八小时和实行集体合同制度的要求。
    一九四六年五月，在艾奇逊发表的声明中，美帝国主义者完全暴露了他们的反共立场。他们竭尽全力把反动的吉田政府搬上台。但是在一九四七年二月总罢工以前，他们还不敢明目张胆禁止罢工。直到一九四七年一月三十一日，鉴于共产党人的领导作用愈来愈有力量，依靠管理生产的工人进行的斗争的规模愈来愈大，美国当局就发布禁止总罢工的命令。从那时起，他们就不断扩大他们的行动，而置波茨坦公告于不顾。禁止总罢工的命令是在一九四七年二月发出的，这是在日本建立目前的殖民地政权的第一步。
    面对着一九四七年二月禁止总罢工的命令，我们党为了加强与以工人阶级为首的群众的联系，向后退却了一步。这时共产党在工人阶级当中的领导作用是强大的，但是在农民当中、特别是在学生和知识分子当中的领导作用仍然是薄弱的。这时党员人数还不够多——只有三万多一些。
    后来党集中全力加强党组织和它们在各种群众团体中的影响；党击退了敌人的各种各样的挑衅和进攻，稳步地建立了它的革命力量。
    在这以前，党在一定程度上低估了在群众团体中进行工作的重要性，而后来党采取坚决的方针，加强党在各个合作社、在文化和艺术工作者中、在中小制造商组织中、在中央和地方政府中、在警察局以及其他迫害人民的机关中的影响。这样做的目的是要使党的活动不单单局限于工人阶级中间，而是要把党的活动扩大到农民、学生、知识分子、中小制造商和商人中去，从而建立一个广泛的民族民主战线。党还曾设法扩展它在青年和妇女中间的活动。
    先前党的大多数报刊都是中央出版的。这时党通过一项决定，规定党的所有地方机关都要出版报刊。到一九四九年年底，党组织一共出版了五千种报纸和杂志。所有党组织也都成立了党课训练班。除了训练领导干部的中央干部学校以外，所有地方党委员会也都开办了学校。我们用这种办法设法提高党员的教育水平。我们一面为实现群众的日常需要、保障他们的利益而斗争，一面加强党与群众的联系，使党在敌人可能进行的种种镇压下更加坚强。
    这样做的结果，党的力量大为增加。
    我们党又用团结社会党和劳农党的左派的方法进行了吸收新党员的工作。结果共产党壮大了许多，到一九四九年年底，党员人数已超过二十万。
    在一九四七年二月禁止总罢工的命令发布以后，共产党员和其他进步分子被大批赶出工会和农民组织。为了达到这种目的，共产党人被加上种种莫须有的罪名，各种行凶和行贿的手段以及各种分裂活动都施展了出来，以削弱党在群众中间的影响。为了应付这种情况，我们党一面设法避免群众组织中的分裂，一面用各种方法加强党的影响——甚至设法加强党在反动分子或中立分子所领导的组织中的影响。这样一来，尽管这些组织中的唯利是图的机会主义领导者进行抵抗，共产党所领导的群众组织中的联合行动运动是加强了，工人群众和农民的联系是加强了，统一战线的策略是扩大了。尽管隶属于产业别工会会议的各个工会以及其他左翼群众组织的会员人数大大减少，但是统一战线策略却在群众组织中广泛而胜利地应用着，共产党的力量并没有减少，相反地却继续增加了。
    在一九四九年一月众议院的选举中，我们党尽管受到吉田政府和美国占领当局的野蛮迫害，仍然得到三百万票，在国会中赢得三十五席。在竞选过程中，党在地方的影响也大大增长，许多共产党员当选为市长、村长和市议会议员，而先前这一切几乎完全没有他们的代表。
    党在各个文化和科学组织和机关中做的工作一直是非常薄弱的，这时已大大扩展了。
    但是在这个时期，与得到这些成绩的同时，产生了两种机会主义。一种机会主义表现在一九四九年春季举行的中央委员会第十五次全体会议中。犯有这种机会主义错误的人低估了美国占领政权的反动本质，认为在国会中用和平方式取得革命的胜利是可能的。
    另一种机会主义表现在一九四九年九月。主张这种机会主义的人认为日本政府完完全全操在美帝国主义者手里，吉田政府以及其他中央和地方政权机关只不过是美帝国主义的工具。因此他们主张党目前的主要任务是只对美国占领军进行斗争，而没有提对吉田政府进行斗争。这些机会主义者主张党集中全力在群众中广泛宣传这种任务，鼓动群众立即为促使美国军队撤退而斗争。
    由于党内进行讨论的结果，党的右翼机会主义得到克服。“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”杂志和“人民日报”刊载的深刻分析日本处境和党的处境的文章在这方面给了党很大帮助。一九五○年一月举行的中央委员会第十八次扩大全体会议一致决定党的当前任务是为结束美国占领政权和推翻以吉田政府为代表的国内反动势力而斗争。但是这种决定没有对当时日本情况作十分清楚的估计，没有确定与国内局势相适应的主要革命行动。党继续受到左派机会主义动摇态度的损害，后来形成了包括以托洛斯基分子为首的各种动摇分子在内的宗派主义集团。
    不用说，这些宗派主义集团的出现便利了美帝国主义者和日本反动派对共产党的进攻。他们趁内部有弱点的机会促进党内的分裂活动。结果使党员人数暂时减少，妨碍了党的进一步壮大。
    这时党有必要拟订一个新纲领，来帮助消除党内分歧，打开一个新局面，让党得到进一步的发展。
    三
    我们党的领导方面缺乏明确认识的一个主要问题就是：战后的日本是一个帝国主义国家呢，还是它已经变成了一个殖民地附属国。党的领导方面认为：日本正如战前一样是一个军事的帝国主义国家，虽然它的正常的发展已经被打断了。的确，党的领导方面也曾指出：由于美国的占领，日本已处于附属国的地位，因此使日本从占领统治下解放出来是一个重要的问题。但是，党的领导方面没有明确地规定这种革命的性质是殖民地、附属国的革命，这种革命的原则是斯大林同志已作过透澈的说明的。共产党的领导方面曾提出了民族解放的任务，并认为在这种情况之下，民族资产阶级能够成为解放斗争中的一个积极因素。我们曾非常努力地研究这个问题，但是，仍然没有完全把这个问题弄明确。
    新纲领的意义在于它除去了这种不明确的地方，规定了日本行将来临的革命的性质是一种附属国的革命，是一种民族解放的民主革命。
    共产党的新纲领正渐渐成为全体人民的纲领。在它的旗帜下已经成立了许多反抗美帝国主义和日本反动势力的坚强组织。这是因为我们党的新纲领真正代表了人民的利益，并给他们指出了一条为了美好的生活而斗争的正确道路。
    从一九四九年秋天开始，我们党除了从前的合法活动以外，又转入了另外一种符合于新的形势的活动方式。战争结束后，我们党曾从事大规模的合法活动，在这个基础上，我们党变成了一个群众性的党，并且在它发展上获得了长足的进展。但是为了对付敌人恶毒的进攻和挑衅，为了使党进一步地发展，我们需要有一种新的组织系统，以利于进行必要的行动。
    由于转入这种新的战术，我们党提出了一个口号：“依靠人民的信任进行斗争”，这就是说，永远不能忘记必须密切地联系群众。这样，党依靠人民的强大力量才得以保存它的组织。在党的领导之下，群众在短短的时间就建立了一系列的反抗组织，这些组织正在击退着敌人的进攻。
    正是由于采取了这种新的战术，我们才得以挫败美帝国主义者和日本反动派的阴谋，他们从一九五○年起便竭尽全力来摧残共产党，并利用党内的反对派来达到这个目的。这种战术并使我们得以保证党的进一步的发展与巩固。
    美国占领当局和日本的吉田反动政府利用占领政权的条件，禁止党的中央委员会委员和“赤旗报”的领导人员参加公共生活。他们“整肃”了工会和国会中最积极的人们，并下令取缔了近两千种进步报纸和杂志，其中有共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”，他们封闭了这些报纸和杂志的印刷所。他们把几万个积极分子不是暗杀掉就是投入监牢，并以各种各样莫须有的罪名来诬告他们。但是，尽管如此，革命的力量还是愈来愈大，愈来愈巩固了，这证明了我们党已战胜敌人的镇压政策。
    由于采行了新纲领，明确地提出了党的目标，全党都投入了更加积极的工作。
    旧金山单独对日“和约”、美日“安全条约”和后来的所谓“行政协定”签订后，人们已经很清楚地认识到这些条约的意思就是：延长美军对日本的占领，奴役日本人民和把日本变成侵略苏联、中国、朝鲜、越南及其他远东国家的基地。
    反动的吉田政府违背国际协定而发表的结束苏联驻日代表团的活动的声明，以及它为了进行侵略战争的目的与蒋介石集团相勾结的行径，更加暴露了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    工人阶级、农民、学生及其他阶层的知识分子和中小工商业者的回答是按照共产党新纲领的精神，起而作坚决的斗争。
    这种强大的人民反抗运动在工会的行动中表现得再清楚不过了，在工会的周围团结着人民群众。在一九五一年年底到一九五二年五月期间，工会曾进行了几次大规模的罢工并且组织示威，参加的人民有一百五十万到四百万。工会就这样有力地打击了法西斯政策，并引起了敌人阵营之内的惊惶失措。
    直到现在，日本的革命运动仍然缺乏与国际力量的充分合作。但是，自从我们采行新纲领并开始实行这个新纲领以来，这种合作已经加强了。许多国家的兄弟共产党和进步团体在朝鲜战争的问题上、在与苏联和新中国的关系上、在反对美国侵略政策的斗争上、在我们党的进一步发展以及其他一些有关我国人民生活的问题上，都给了我们以巨大的精神上的帮助。
    在这方面具有特别重大意义的是约·维·斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电。这封电报不仅加强了日本人民的国际联系，并且也无可衡量地帮助了他们去加紧与美帝国主义者和日本反动势力的反苏、反共政策作斗争，同时还帮助他们为胜利地实现共产党新纲领中所提出来的任务而奋斗。
    四
    在美国占领军的命令之下实施的“土地改革”，是一个彻头彻尾的骗局。
    社会党右派与“左”倾的冒险分子说：由于这种改革，将可耕地分配给农民的工作已经完成，唯一的问题是目前的农业无利可图，因此投于农业的资本极为不够。
    根据这种推理，他们就讥笑我们党的土地政策，说我们提出实行革命的土地改革的要求是很可笑的。
    那时候我们没有能够在这个问题上给社会党右派和“左”倾冒险分子以决定性的打击。我们虽然提出了革命的土地改革的要求，同时并坚持满足由于国内不同地区的不同情况所引起的农民其他的各种要求，但是我们没有正确地把这些局部的要求和基本要求——实行革命的土地改革——联系起来。因此，我们没有能把农民、特别是作为农民运动的主力的贫农争取到我们方面来。
    我们党的新纲领，完全肃清了这种在土地问题上的不明确的地方，指出了农业的发展与农民生活的改善，只有在实行了革命的土地改革并且完全铲除了人民生活中的封建残余的基础上才能实现。实际上，在美国占领军命令之下实行的“土地改革”，并没有给中农与贫农任何利益。根据这样的土地改革，农民所得到土地必须支付大笔金钱。农民上了圈套而又背上这种沉重的经济负担，结果他们所得到的土地很快就又落到地主与富农手里去了，农民反比以前更为穷困。
    这种“土地改革”，把森林与荒地都留给了地主。社会党右派和“左”倾冒险分子说：关于这种状态，我们没有理由把责任归在政府身上，因为将来这些森林与荒地都要完全交给政府。然而，在日本，耕地只占整个土地面积的百分之十六，不把森林与荒地交给农民，任何改革对于农民都毫无用处。农民为了畜牧、砍柴和取得肥料而使用森林与荒地时，必须支付大量的金钱。这样一来，地主与富农的统治就在乡村里树立起来了。
    目前在强有力的反抗组织的保护之下，农民继续在作有组织的斗争，要求把森林与荒地无偿地交给他们。
    “土地改革”也没有触动灌溉与改良土壤的设备，没有这些设备，农民们是不能改进耕作的。
    因此，这种“土地改革”不仅没有扫除乡村中的封建残余，而且还有助于保存反动势力的统治。违反民族利益的“自由”党之所以仍能在国会中占大多数，正是因为它牢牢地依靠着乡村中根深蒂固的封建残余势力。因此，如果不实行革命的土地改革，不仅不可能根本改善农民的生活条件，就是进一步发展农业生产也是同样不可能的。而不发展农业生产，也就不可能改善工人阶级与全体人民的生活。我国人民像以前一样，被迫生活在天皇制之下，仍然受美国人的奴役，忍受失业的痛苦，充当战争的炮灰。美帝国主义者实行骗人的所谓“土地改革”，正是为了要达到这些目的。
    共产党的新纲领发表以后，实行革命的土地改革以及把森林、荒地与灌溉设备等交给农民的要求，在乡村里格外普遍了。
    除了规定以革命方式解决土地问题以外，新纲领还规定取消半封建性的劳力剥削，工会应有自由，彻底改善人民群众的物质条件，并把实现这些要求的斗争与农民的斗争密切结合起来。这样，为切实实现新纲领而作的斗争，就巩固了工人与农民间的联盟。这种斗争并把那些同样遭受美国占领与吉田政府统治痛苦的学生、知识分子、手工业者、中小商人与工商业者都吸引到工人阶级方面来了。所有这些力量都团结在以工农联盟为主力的民族解放民主统一战线以内。这些革命力量依靠各种反抗组织正与美国占领军及日本反动势力作斗争。
    正因为根据新纲领而使所有的革命力量切实地巩固了起来，这些革命力量才从一九五一年底起发动了大规模的攻势。
    五
    由于美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，美帝国主义者加在日本身上的桎梏更加沉重了。美国人开始从日本榨取这个战争所需要的大部分物资。因此，这个国家的许多日用必需品都极端缺乏。朝鲜战争的旷日持久，使经济危机更为严重。日本资本家所引为自豪的纺织业，最近也不得不把它的生产能力削减百分之四十。这对于许多与纺织业有关系的中小企业是一个沉重的打击。拥有资本一千万日元以上的一百多个大公司完全破产。经济危机也席卷了其他工业部门，自化学工业起，以至机器制造工业。在目前，经济危机已深入到钢铁工业——战争工业的核心。完全失业和部分失业的人数在一千八百万以上。整个说来，人民过着实在难以忍受的生活。
    莫斯科国际经济会议表明：许多国家（包括美国）的一些资本家，由于这些国家的经济转上战争轨道的结果，已面临到破产的危险，他们希望和苏联、新中国、人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国和平相处，并和这些国家发展贸易。日本的许多资本家也有这样的意见。预料订于九月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将有许多代表参加。最近参加过莫斯科国际经济会议的日本资本家的三个代表，代表日本参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。
    美帝国主义者为了想掩盖他们在朝鲜所遭到的失败，就进行细菌战，并对战俘使用残酷的报复手段。但是，在这些暴行被揭发后，日本人民对美帝国主义者的仇恨更增加了；他们反对帝国主义战争、争取迅速撤退占领军、争取民族独立的斗争，发展得更为壮大了。群众的这种愈来愈强的抵抗，正在粉碎着美国在日本的殖民统治，使美帝国主义者越来越站不住脚。在目前，美国建立世界统治权的政策，正在所有国家中遭受失败。他们为了避免这种失败，使用了法西斯暴力手段。但是，尽管他们使用这种法西斯手段，甚至在美国本国，也发生了巨大规模的罢工。倚靠美国的资本主义国家的经济危机，正在加深。所有这一切都使美帝国主义者更难用赤裸裸的暴力手段来奴役我国人民。
    美国垄断资本和它的政治代理人，在这种严重情势面前只好大肆利用匪徒组织，并在日本使用更加野蛮的法西斯统治手段。但是这只有使日本的危机严重化，使美国代理人在人民面前更加感到孤立。结果，美帝国主义愈来愈难维持它精神的和政治的基础——吉田政府了。
    由于这样，美帝国主义者和日本的反动势力就十分害怕广大群众所进行的争取民族独立和自由、争取保障和平的斗争。任何法西斯的镇压现在都压制不了愈来愈壮大的人民革命运动。在目前，日本的革命运动与世界和平阵营有密切的联系。而且，由于这种联系牵涉到许多日常经济问题，这种联系就越来越坚固。
    由此可见，日本人民的奋勇前进是不可抗拒的。
    六
    由于新纲领的具体实施，我们党中不可能再有反对派存在。大部分反对派分子——除去托洛斯基“国际派”，这派的人现在只剩下为数极少的冒险分子了——都承认了他们的错误，回到党的队伍来了。另外有些人正在要求准许他们重新归队。在目前，党正在统一意志和统一领导的基础上发展。但是我们仍有一些缺点。
    例如，这些缺点包括：在举行某些罢工和示威时，没有考虑到工农的实际要求和奋斗的目标，而只是根据领导的意图。那末，领导人员就集中力量在罢工和示威方面，而常常对国会选举和地方当局选举这种形式的斗争重视不足。我们的任务是：对党员坚持进行阶级政治训练，掌握把合法工作和地下工作配合起来进行的艺术，克服我们在工作中仍然发生的缺点，把我们的全部活动建筑在维持群众的信心上，不要落在迅速发展的革命斗争的后面。
    在回顾日本共产党这三十年来的活动的时候，我们特别认识到需要以马克思—列宁主义的理论来武装我们党，坚定地遵奉伟大的领袖、全体劳动人民的导师、和平的旗手约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林的指示。
    把马克思—列宁主义运用在中国革命上、给中国指出一条新道路的毛泽东思想，也必须成为我们的经常指南。
    日本共产党三十周年万岁！
    打倒帝国主义战争！
    日本人民的独立、自由与和平万岁！
    民族解放民主革命万岁！
    与苏联、中国及其他所有爱好和平的国家的和平与合作万岁！
