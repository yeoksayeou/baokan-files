Reader's Letters

Zhao Yin'ai, Deputy Village Chief of Wuzhuang Village, Lingshi, Shanxi
Actively Leads Mutual Aid Teams in Production Increase Competition

Comrade Editor: The women's mutual aid team led by Zhao Yin'ai (female Communist Party member), deputy village chief of Wuzhuang Village, Second District, Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, has been reorganized into a joint male-female mutual aid team this year in the patriotic production increase competition, and has launched a heated production increase competition. Zhao Yin'ai's mutual aid team originally had six women. This year, they and six labor models from the district, including Cao Guocheng, jointly challenged the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, and challenged all male and female labor models, mutual aid teams, and all farmers in the county. After the competition began, a difficulty arose: they had no money to buy fertilizer. Because all the team members were women, except for Zhao Yin'ai, the others did not manage household affairs, and their husbands did not agree with them participating in the production increase competition and would not give them money to buy fertilizer. At first, Zhao Yin'ai and all the team members were worried and could not think of a solution. Later, they felt that the best way was to organize by household, so that the difficulties could be solved. But the men of the six women were not in the same group. Should they bring all their men over, or should they be dispersed into different groups? They felt that they had been organized for three or four years, and there were already some rules in the mutual aid team, so they did not agree or want to be dispersed. However, the men were unwilling to follow the women into the group (only Zhao Yin'ai's husband was persuaded by her and had no objections). They were afraid that increased production would mean more burdens, and they were afraid of making plans, competitions, and meetings, and found it troublesome. Moreover, they had feudal and backward ideas and were unwilling to be led by women. After discovering these ideological concerns, they used mass meetings and mutual aid team meetings to repeatedly explain production policies, the future of mutual aid teams, and the correct principles of equality between men and women, especially explaining to the men in their group the benefits of joint labor. Finally, the men agreed to join their mutual aid team. Everyone happily elected Zhao Yin'ai and Tian Jiquan (Yin'ai's husband) as the head and deputy head of the group. Now the whole group has six households, with eight male laborers, six female laborers, two cows, and one hundred and thirty-three mu of land. The group has re-established various systems and production increase plans. Everyone said, "The household-based mutual aid team is really good. Everything is unified." Now all the team members are actively working hard to achieve the patriotic production increase plan.

Model Rice Production Village, Zhongbache Village
Improve Irrigation of Paddy Fields and Strive for Greater Harvests

Comrade Editor: Last year, our village's more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields yielded an average of 930 jin per mu, an increase of 70% compared to before liberation, and received a production increase award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.
After the entire village received the award, their enthusiasm for production was even higher. In order to drive the masses in the neighboring eighteen villages to start a production increase upsurge, our entire village, with the assistance of the district government, invited representatives from the neighboring eighteen villages to hold a production meeting. Everyone exchanged production experiences at the meeting, and our village also proposed a patriotic production increase challenge competition to them. The eighteen villages happily accepted the challenge. Our village's rice production increase plan for this year is to produce an average of 1,104 jin per mu, an increase of 174 jin compared to last year. Among them, 59 mu of specially high-yield land is required to produce an average of 1,800 jin per mu.
In order to ensure the completion of the production increase plan, we paid special attention to building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer. Our village is close to the Haihe River. Although we did a good job of digging ditches and draining water during the spring drought, we still cannot prevent the intrusion of salt water. On June 10th, the entire village specially mobilized more than 400 people, leading more than 500 people from other villages, to block the Haihe River water and divert water from Junliangcheng for irrigation. As a result, more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields in five villages were protected from the harm of salt water. In addition, the masses of our entire village put forward the slogan "turn dead wealth into living wealth" and launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign to solve the difficulty of fertilizer shortage. Everyone said that after the autumn harvest this year, we will save money and use it to accumulate all the fertilizer for next year, and strive not to rely on government loans to buy fertilizer anymore.
We believe that the entire village will definitely win another great victory on the production front this year.

Turned-Over Peasant Luo Shangqian
Sacrifices His Boat to Repair a Dangerous Dam

Comrade Editor: Luo Shangqian, a farmer from Xilin Township, Hanshou County, Hunan Province, was driving a small boat to Neihu Lake in Xinxing Township on June 8th to collect grass. At 4:00 pm, his boat arrived at Wufu Township and found that a section of the most dangerous part of the embankment, two meters long, was about to collapse due to water erosion. He used the grass he had collected to block the cracks and shouted loudly for the masses to come to the rescue. Five minutes later, five people came to help him. But the water flowed more and more, and they could not stop it. They immediately sent someone to report to the district office. District cadres immediately led more than 300 people, carrying trees and bamboo baskets, to the rescue. Everyone repaired the dam and blocked the breach. But they could not stop the water from flowing through the breach. Later, everyone took a thatched shed and a waterwheel from the dam to fill the breach, but they were washed away by the torrent. Everyone rescued for more than two hours, but they could not resist the water flow. Many people were discouraged because of this. Luo Shangqian kept vigorously driving piles and carrying soil, his whole body soaked in sweat. He suddenly remembered that the newspaper had reported that "Hu Youcai stuffed his cotton clothes into the holes in the dam for the benefit of the masses." "Can't I do it?" Thinking of this, he immediately sank his own boat to block the breach. He and the others drove piles and filled soil inside and outside the dam, and rescued until after 3:00 am before repairing the dam.
Luo Shangqian is an honest farmer who turned over in the land reform. He pays great attention to learning and reads the newspaper every night. This time, in an emergency, he led the masses to actively repair the dam and sacrificed his boat to help the masses in another township (Wufu Township) overcome the danger, demonstrating a high degree of political awareness. The masses of Wufu Township are planning to compensate him for his boat.

Listening to the Radio Can Promote Agricultural Production

Comrade Editor: In the patriotic production increase competition movement, the four villages in the fifth district of Fangshan County, Hebei Province, used forms such as meetings, people's schools, and street organization listening sessions to mobilize more than 5,000 farmers to regularly listen to broadcasts from the People's Broadcasting Station, which had a great effect. The farmers said, "In the past, not to mention listening to the radio, we had never even seen it. That was the blessing of city people. Now we live in the village and we can listen to the radio." The farmers love the radio very much and trust what the radio station says very much. Under the encouragement of the broadcasters, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has become even higher. Xinkaikou Village originally had twenty-seven mutual aid teams, only one of which was long-term. After the farmers in the village listened to the radio, twenty-five temporary mutual aid teams wanted to become permanent mutual aid teams, and they formulated production increase plans and challenged each other, preparing to "compare seedlings before autumn and compare harvests after autumn." After the Li Qingjie mutual aid team in Banbidian Village listened to the radio, they felt that their production increase plan was not realistic, so they re-formulated a practical and feasible plan based on the actual situation. After listening to the radio, more than 1,400 farmers in these four villages newly organized 161 mutual aid teams. Therefore, I think it is necessary to promote radio propaganda in rural areas.

Agricultural Production Must Have Leadership

Comrade Editor: Since liberation, I have always had a kind of "theory of spontaneous agricultural production" in my mind, thinking that farmers can produce on their own and do not need cadres to lead them. This year, the insect plague in our township was very serious, but after a led and organized attack, more than half of the rice borers in the entire township were eliminated after a few days. At this time, I secretly thought that production does need leadership. Immediately afterwards, the entire township launched campaigns such as trampling fields, digging soil, and secondary fertilizer accumulation. I helped some farmers organize a mutual aid team. We implemented mutual assistance and mutual benefit. The four households in the team that lacked labor solved the difficulties of lacking food and fertilizer, and were able to concentrate on production. Now there are already five or six mutual aid teams in the entire township. From this, it can be seen that production must have leadership. If leadership is not carried out, the insect pests in our township will definitely be rampant, and patriotic production increase will become empty talk, and the difficulties of households lacking labor will not be solved. A widow in the township said, "If it weren't for the good leadership of the People's Government, my current production difficulties would not be solved." This shows that the masses welcome our leadership. In short, I have realized that the past view that "production does not need leadership" was wrong. I must work hard to lead farmers to do a good job in production in the future.

Peixian and Huashan Counties Should Strengthen Forest Protection Work

Comrade Editor: This spring, Peixian County, Shandong Province, and Huashan County carried out planned tree planting and afforestation work. However, these two counties do not pay attention to forest protection work, and the districts and townships often experience the destruction of trees and seedlings. Peixian County afforested more than 14,000 mu this spring, planting more than 2.34 million trees, and the survival rate is generally very high. The masses in the county often go to the forest area to shovel grass and dig up grass roots, causing great damage to the seedlings. For example, more than one-third of the seedlings planted by Liu Qingxia, the afforestation model of Suzhuang in the Sixth District, who led the masses, were dug up by people digging up grass roots. The trees planted in Guanyuan Village in the Fifth District grew particularly well. Each tree was cultivated with a soil mound, and the survival rate reached 98%. However, many small trees are dug up by people digging up grass roots every day. Some leading cadres in Huashan County even condone this kind of destruction of seedlings.
The masses work hard to plant trees and afforest the land. How can we allow a small group of people to destroy them casually? I hope that the leaders of Peixian County and Huashan County will quickly find ways to correct and prevent this kind of thing.

People's Courts Should Combine Punishment and Education
When Sentencing Cases of Destroying Forests

Comrade Editor: Recently, the Shicheng County People's Court of the Ningdu Special District in Jiangxi Province sentenced Liu Juhong and Yang Yongmu, who destroyed mountain forests, to one month and four months of imprisonment, respectively. Liu Juhong is a farmer from Hetian Township, Shicheng County. In order to fertilize his fields, he twice set fire to burn down more than 50 mu of mountain forests. Yang Yongmu is a farmer from Yanggu Township, Shicheng County. He caused a mountain fire due to burning paper money during tomb sweeping. The mountain fire burned for three days and three nights, burning down 4,342 mu of mountain forests.
I think this kind of sentence is too light. The Ningdu Special District is a mountainous area. Mountain fires often occur in various counties because farmers deliberately burn them, thinking that "burning mountains is good for fertilizing fields," or because of careless burning of field ridges or burning paper money during tomb sweeping. It is entirely necessary to impose appropriate sentences on these perpetrators who destroy mountain forests, depending on the severity of their circumstances. This is an education for both the perpetrators themselves and the masses. However, if the sentence is too light, the educational significance will not be great. At the same time, I think that the People's Court should not only sentence people and leave it at that. If it can publicly announce some typical cases, and use this form to publicize the policy of closing mountains for afforestation, so as to achieve the goal of combining punishment and education, it will be more effective in actively educating the masses.

    山西灵石吴庄村副村长赵银爱
    积极领导互助组参加增产竞赛
    编辑同志：山西灵石县二区吴庄村副村长赵银爱（女共产党员）领导的妇女互助组，在今年的爱国增产竞赛运动中，已改组为男女合组的互助组，开展了热烈的增产竞赛。赵银爱互助组，原来共有六个妇女。今年她们和本区曹国成等六个劳动模范，联名向李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社应战，并向全县男女劳动模范、互助组及全体农民挑战。竞赛开始以后，发生了一个困难：没钱买肥料。因为全体组员都是妇女，除赵银爱外，其他人在家庭中都不管事，丈夫们不赞成她们参加增产竞赛，不拿钱买肥料。开头赵银爱和全组组员都发了愁，想不出办法。后来她们觉得最好的办法是以户为单位组织起来，这样可以解决困难。但六个妇女的男人都不在一组，是都把自己的男人拉过来呢？还是分散到各组去？她们感到自己组织起来已有三、四年的基础，互助组里也有了一些制度，都不同意也不愿意分散。可是男人们却不愿意跟着女人到组里去（只有赵银爱的男人被她说服，没意见了），他们怕增产了要多负担，又怕订计划、怕竞赛、怕开会、嫌麻烦，而且有封建落后思想，不愿叫女人领导男人。她们发现这些思想顾虑后，就利用群众会、互助组会，反复讲解生产政策，互助组的前途，以及男女平等的正确道理，特别对她们组的男人们讲解共同劳动好处多的道理，最后男人们终于同意加入她们的互助组了。大家愉快地选举赵银爱和田计全（银爱男人）为正副组长。现在全组六户，共有男劳力八个，女劳力六个，牛两头，土地一百三十三亩。组里重新订立了各种制度和增产计划。大家都说：“以户为单位的互助组实在好，干什么也统一了。”现在全体组员都积极劳动，努力争取实现爱国增产计划。    赵福祥
　　水稻丰产模范村中八车村
    改善稻田灌溉争取更大丰收
    编辑同志：去年我们村二千多亩水稻田，每亩平均收获九百三十斤，比解放前增产百分之七十，得到中央人民政府农业部的丰产奖。
    全村群众得奖以后，生产热情更高了。为了带动邻近十八个村的群众掀起丰产热潮，我们全村群众在区政府协助下，邀请邻近十八村的代表，开了生产会议。大家在会上交流了生产经验，我们村还向他们提出爱国增产挑战竞赛。十八个村都很高兴地应战了。我们村今年的水稻丰产计划是每亩平均生产一千一百零四斤，比去年增加一百七十四斤，其中五十九亩特别丰产地，要求每亩平均生产一千八百斤。
    为了保证完成增产计划，我们特别注意兴修水利和积肥。我们村临近海河，虽然在春季抗旱时，已做好挖沟排水工作，但还不能防御咸水浸入。六月十日，全村特地发动四百多人，带领其他各村五百多人，堵住海河水，另由军粮城导水灌溉。这一来，有五个村七千多亩稻田，防止了咸水的危害，此外，我们全村群众提出“以死财变活财”的口号，展开了积肥运动，解决了缺肥的困难。大家说，今年秋收后省吃俭用，怎样也要积好明年全部肥料，争取不再依靠政府贷款买肥料。
    我们相信，全村在今年的生产战线上，一定能再打一个大胜仗。

　　翻身农民罗尚前
    牺牲自己船只抢修险堤
    编辑同志：湖南汉寿县西林乡农民罗尚前，在六月八日驾着一只小船到新兴垸内湖去捞草。下午四时，他的船到达五福垸，发现那里最险要的堤段中，有二公尺长的一段，被水冲得快要崩裂了。他一面用自己捞来的草堵塞裂口，一面高声呼唤群众来抢救。五分钟后，来了五人帮他抢救。但水越流越多，抢救不住。他们立刻派人到区公所报告。区干部马上带领三百多群众，携着树木、竹篮赶来抢救。众人一面修堤，一面堵挡缺口。但怎样也挡不住缺口流水。后来大家把大堤上一个茅棚、一部水车拿来填塞缺口，又被激流冲走了。众人抢救了两个多钟头，总没法抵住水流。很多人因此灰心丧气。罗尚前一直起劲地打桩挑土，浑身被汗水浸透了。他忽然想起报纸上曾登过“胡有才为了群众利益，把自己的棉衣塞住堤上漏洞”的报道。“我难道做不到吗？”想到这里，他立即动手把自己的船弄沉，挡住了缺口的水。他又和众人在堤里外打桩填土，一直抢救到半夜三点多钟，才补好了堤。
    罗尚前是一个老实农民，在土地改革中翻了身。他很注意学习，每天晚上都读报纸，这次他在紧急关头，带领群众，积极修堤，并牺牲自己的船只，帮助外乡（五福垸）群众抢险，表现了很高的政治觉悟。五福垸群众正在筹划着补偿他的船。

　　收听广播可以推动农业增产
    编辑同志：河北房山县五区四个村在爱国增产竞赛运动中，利用会议、民校、街头组织收听场等形式，发动五千多个农民，经常收听人民广播电台的广播，效果很大。农民们说：“过去不用说听广播，见也没见过，那是城里人的福，现今咱们住在村里，就听上了广播。”农民十分喜爱广播，十分相信广播台说的话。在广播员的鼓动下，农民生产热情更加高涨。辛开口村原有二十七个互助组，其中只有一个是长期的。该村农民收听了广播以后，就有二十五个临时互助组要转为常年互助组，并订出增产计划，彼此挑战竞赛，准备“秋前比苗儿，秋后比收成”。半壁店村李庆杰互助组收听广播后，感觉自己组里的增产计划不切实际，便重新根据实际情况，订立了切实可行的计划。这四个村收听广播后，有一千四百多个农民新组织了一百六十一个互助组。因此，我认为在农村中推行广播宣传是必要的。    索培珍
    农业生产必须有领导
    编辑同志：解放以来，我一直有一种“农业生产自流论”的思想，认为农民自己会生产，不用干部去领导。今年我们乡的虫灾很严重，但经过有领导有组织的扑打，几天之后，全乡螟虫半数以上被消灭了。这时我暗想，生产确是需要有领导的。紧接着全乡又展开踩田、挖土、二次积肥等运动，我帮助一些农民组织了一个互助组。我们实行互助互济，组内四户缺乏劳动力的人家，解决了缺乏口粮、肥料等困难，安心进行生产。现在全乡已有五、六个互助组了。由此可见，生产是必需有领导的。若不进行领导，我乡的虫害一定会很猖獗，爱国增产便会变成空谈，缺乏劳动力的人家的困难便不能解决。乡中有个寡妇说：“要不是人民政府领导得好，我目前的生产困难便没法解决。”这说明群众是欢迎我们领导的。总之，我已认识到过去“生产不需领导”的看法是错误的，我今后一定要努力领导农民搞好生产。

　　沛县和华山县应加强护林工作
    编辑同志：今年春天，山东沛县、华山县有计划地进行了植树造林工作。但这两个县不注意护林工作，各区乡常常发生破坏树木树苗的事情。沛县今春造林一万四千多亩，植树二百三十四万多株，成活率一般都很高。该县群众常到林区铲草和刨草根，使苗木受到很大损失。如六区苏庄造林模范刘庆霞领导群众种的树苗，有三分之一以上被刨草根的刨掉了。五区关园村种的树成长特别好，每株都培了土墩，成活率达百分之九十八。可是每天有不少小树，被刨草根的刨掉。华山县有些乡的领导干部，竟然包庇这种破坏树苗的事情。
    群众辛辛苦苦地植树造林，怎能容许一小伙人随随便便地加以破坏呢？希望沛县、华山县的领导方面，赶快想法纠正和防止这种事情。

　　人民法院判处破坏山林的案件
    应做到惩罚与教育相结合
    编辑同志：最近江西宁都专区石城县人民法院分别判处破坏山林的刘居洪和杨永沐一个月和四个月的徒刑。刘居洪是石城县河田乡的农民，他为了肥田，曾两次纵火烧毁山林五十多亩。杨永沐是石城县阳古乡的农民，他因扫墓烧纸，造成烧山事件。山火烧了三天三夜，烧毁山林四千三百四十二亩。
    我觉得这种判处太轻了。宁都专区是山区，各县发生的烧山事件，常常是由于农民认为“烧了山好肥田”而故意烧的，或是由于焚烧田坎、扫墓烧纸不慎引起的。对这些破坏山林的肇事者，根据其情节轻重，判处适当徒刑，是完全必要的，这对其本人和群众都是一种教育。但判处太轻，教育意义就不大了。同时，我认为，人民法院对这种事情，不要仅仅判处了事，如果能把一些典型案件公开宣判出来，通过这种形式，宣传封山育林政策，达到惩罚与教育相结合的目的，那就更能发挥积极教育群众的作用。    贾戈人
