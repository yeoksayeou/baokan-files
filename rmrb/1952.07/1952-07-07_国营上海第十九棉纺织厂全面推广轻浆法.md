The weaving workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Mill, with the specific help of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, have experimented with and promoted the light sizing method.

Before the warp yarn of the cloth factory is woven into cloth, sizing is necessary, but heavy sizing is not required. In the past, most cotton mills implemented the heavy sizing method. For example, for 12-pound fine yarn, the sizing rate was as high as 28% (the percentage of sizing in the weight of the warp yarn in the cloth). In the past, the reason for implementing the heavy sizing method was sometimes to make the appearance of the cloth look good, and some manufacturers even attempted to increase the starch content in the cloth to reduce the amount of yarn used, in order to obtain high profits. The greige fabric woven with heavy sizing must also undergo a desizing process when it is sent to a printing and dyeing factory for processing. Therefore, the implementation of the heavy sizing method is not only useless but also wastes a large amount of state resources.

In order to change this situation, the weaving workers of the No. 19 Mill were determined to implement light sizing. On April 8th, the mill workers began to experiment with the light sizing method with emphasis, and after more than a month of efforts, the initial experiment was successful and began to be fully promoted. Now, the sizing rate of the greige fabric of the No. 19 Mill has been reduced from 28% to 14%, which can save 3.1 billion yuan per year in sizing materials alone. The yarn breakage rate on the looms has also been reduced compared to before. According to recent measurements, looms using heavy-sized warp beams in the loom shed had a maximum of 2 yarn breakages per loom per hour, with an average of 1.28; while looms using light-sized warp beams had a maximum of 1.5 yarn breakages per loom per hour, with an average of 0.94. Due to the reduction of yarn breakages, 378 more pieces of cloth can be woven throughout the year. After the implementation of light sizing, the quality, length, and width of the cloth are the same as heavy-sized cloth. At the same time, because less sizing is applied, the humidity and moisture content of the cloth shed can be reduced, which is of great significance for preventing mildew and heat in cotton cloth.

The composition of the sizing material for light sizing does not use any stone powder, reduces the amount of flour and tallow used, and only increases dextrin (processed starch). To implement light sizing, the yarn sizing shop must improve the yarn sizing operating techniques and correctly master the sizing rate (14%) and moisture regain (about 7.5%). The sizing material for yarn sizing must first be tested and weighed to ensure that the quality and weight meet the specified standards. The departments implementing light sizing should strictly master the mixing method and the determination of the concentration of the sizing liquid.

Close cooperation between workshops is an important condition for implementing the light sizing method. The operation methods of the preparation workshop must be improved, and the large knots of the cone yarn and the defects on the warp yarn must be eliminated. Recently, the No. 19 Mill has trialed a fixed supply system in the preparation workshop, which has played a great role in the close cooperation of the workshops. The fixed supply system is to fix the supply of semi-finished products in the production process. For example, a cone winder is fixed to supply a warper; a warper is fixed to supply a slasher; a slasher is fixed to supply a loom. At the same time, after the implementation of the light sizing method, the temperature and humidity in the loom shed should not be too high, otherwise, the warp yarn will be too soft, the abrasion resistance will not be enough, and phenomena such as desizing will occur, increasing the yarn breakage. According to the experimental results of the No. 19 Mill, the relative humidity in the loom shed is more suitable between 76% and 80%.

The workers and staff are enthusiastically supporting the light sizing method. Yang Hanqing, an elderly worker in the yarn sizing shop, said: "After light sizing, the warp yarn is thinner, and each warp beam can wind 22 pieces of cloth (originally each warp beam only wound 18 pieces), saving two warp beams a day, saving manpower."

### 国营上海第十九棉纺织厂全面推广轻浆法

    国营上海第十九棉纺织厂全面推广轻浆法
    国营上海第十九棉纺织厂织部工人，在华东纺织管理局、中国纺织工会上海市委员会具体帮助下，试验和推广了轻浆工作法。
    布厂的经纱在没有织成布以前，上浆是必要的，但不需要上重浆。过去一般棉纺织厂都实行重浆法。如十二磅的细纱，上浆率高达百分之二十八（浆占布内经纱重量的百分数）。过去所以实行重浆法，有的是为了使布品的外表好看，有些厂商更企图在布品中增加浆料成份，以减轻用纱分量，便于获取厚利。采用重浆织成的坯布，送到印染厂加工印染时，还须经过一道脱浆工序。所以，实行重浆法不但无益处，反浪费了国家大量的资财。
    为了改变这种情况，十九厂织部工人决心实行轻浆。四月八日，该厂工人开始有重点地试验轻浆法，经过月余努力，初步试验成功，并开始全面推广。现在，十九厂坯布的上浆率，已由百分之二十八减低到百分之十四，只浆料一项每年便可节约三十一亿元。布机上的断头率，也比以前减少了。根据最近测定，布机间采用重浆经轴的布机，每台每小时最多断头二根，平均为一点二八根；而采用轻浆经轴的布机，每台每小时最多断头一点五根，平均是零点九四根。因断头减少，全年可多织布三百七十八匹。实行轻浆以后，布的质量及布长、布幅等，都和重浆布一样。同时，因为上的浆少了，布机间湿度和布的含水率便可以减低，对防止棉布发霉发热有很大作用。
    实行轻浆的浆料成份中，完全不用石粉，减少了面粉和牛油的用量，只是增加糊精（加工后的淀粉）。要实行轻浆，浆纱间必须要改进浆纱操作技术，正确掌握上浆率（百分之十四）和合水率（百分之七点五左右）。浆纱的浆料，必须先经化验和过磅，使质量、重量符合规定标准。实行轻浆的部门应该严格掌握调浆方法和浆液浓度的测定等。
    各车间密切配合，是实行轻浆法的重要条件。准备车间的操作方法要加以改善，并消灭筒子纱的大结头和经纱上的缺点。最近，十九厂在准备车间试行了固定供应制，对各车间的密切配合，起了很大作用。固定供应制就是在生产过程中，把半成品的供应固定起来。如某台筒子车固定供给某台经纱车；某台经纱车固定供给某台浆纱车；某台浆纱车固定供给某台布机。同时，在实行轻浆法以后，布机间的温湿度不宜过高，否则，经纱便太柔软，耐摩力不够，发生形如脱浆的现象，增加纱的断头。根据十九厂试验结果，布机间的相对湿度在百分之七十六至百分之八十之间较适宜。
    职工对轻浆法是热情拥护的。浆纱间老年工人杨汉清说：“轻浆以后，经纱薄了，每只经轴可卷二十二匹布（原来每只经轴只卷十八匹），一天可少上两只经轴，节省了人力。”（国营上海第十九棉纺织厂耿人）
