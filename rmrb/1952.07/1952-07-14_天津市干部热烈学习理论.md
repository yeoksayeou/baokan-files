Tianjin’s Party and non-Party cadres in various organs, under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tianjin Municipal General Study Committee, have been widely engaged in the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought since June. According to the Tianjin Municipal Committee Propaganda Department's 1952 cadre theoretical education plan: from June 1st to July 10th, combined with the summary of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they will study "Recognizing the Bourgeoisie and Correctly Treating the Bourgeoisie." From July 11th to September 15th, they will study Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." After September 15th until the end of the year, the city's cadres will be divided into two groups for study: cadres in the financial and economic enterprise system will study the theory of economic construction; cadres in general government organs, Party committees, and mass organizations will study the history of the Communist Party of China. In order to strengthen leadership and cultivate backbones in the study, the Cadre Spare-time Political School established by the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC has opened a "Party History Class," absorbing more than 600 cadres to study "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and the history of the CPC in advance. In addition, leading cadres from various organs throughout the city have been organized into a "Theoretical Instructor Research Class" to guide the study in various organs, convey reports, and answer difficult questions. At present, the city's cadre study is proceeding according to plan, and the enthusiasm for learning is very high. The cadres participating in the study of "Recognizing the Bourgeoisie and Correctly Treating the Bourgeoisie" come from 26 systems, including the Party committees of various enterprises and organs, district committees, and the Tianjin County Committee, totaling more than 25,000 people. Before the study, the vast majority of cadres participated in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and engaged in face-to-face struggles with illegal capitalists, accumulating rich experience in class struggle. Before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many cadres lacked a clear and profound understanding of the nature of the bourgeoisie and the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, resulting in a lack of necessary vigilance and struggle against the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements. However, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they only saw the dark and corrupt side of the bourgeoisie, which temporarily led to "leftist" sentiments. After studying, they generally have a more correct and comprehensive understanding of the bourgeoisie. The original study organizations of various units were mostly temporarily suspended due to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Through this study, they have begun to recover and strengthen their leadership. Some systems plan to set up full-time theoretical study cadres in units with more than 50 people. The leadership of the study is generally undertaken by responsible comrades of the Party and administrative leading cadres. All of these provide favorable conditions for the gradual regularization of cadre theoretical study in the future.

    天津市干部热烈学习理论
    天津市各机关的党与非党干部，在中国共产党天津市委员会宣传部和天津市总学习委员会的领导下，自六月份起，普遍展开了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习。按照市委宣传部一九五二年干部理论教育计划的规定：自六月一日至七月十日，结合“三反”“五反”运动的总结，进行
    “认清资产阶级，正确对待资产阶级”的学习。七月十一日到九月十五日，学习毛泽东同志的哲学著作“实践论”和“矛盾论”。九月十五日以后到年底，全市干部分两部分学习：财经企业系统干部学习经济建设的理论；一般政府机关、党委、群众团体干部学习中国共产党党史。为了加强领导，培养学习中的骨干，中共天津市委宣传部所成立的干部业余政治学校已开办了“党史班”，吸收了六百余干部提前学习“实践论”、“矛盾论”与中共党史。此外，并将全市各机关负责干部组成了“理论教员研究班”，以便指导各机关的学习、传达报告及解答疑难问题等。目前全市干部学习正按计划进行，学习情绪非常饱满，参加“认清资产阶级、正确对待资产阶级”这一学习的干部，有各企业、机关的党委、各区委、天津县委等二十六个系统，共二万五千余人。在学习以前，广大干部都参加过“三反”“五反”运动，对不法资本家进行过面对面的斗争，积累了丰富的阶级斗争的经验。许多干部在“三反”“五反”运动以前，由于对资产阶级的本质和中国民族资产阶级的两面性缺乏明确而深刻的认识，以致对不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻缺乏必要的警惕和斗争。但在“三反”“五反”运动以后，又由于他们只看见资产阶级黑暗腐朽的一面，一时产生了“左”倾情绪。经过学习之后，他们对资产阶级一般的都有了比较正确的全面认识。各单位原有的学习组织，因“三反”“五反”运动大部暂时停顿，通过这次学习，都已开始恢复，并加强了领导。有些系统并打算在五十人以上的单位设置专职的理论学习干部。学习的领导，一般都由党的负责同志和行政领导干部来担任。所有这些，都为今后干部理论学习逐步走向正规提供了有利条件。
