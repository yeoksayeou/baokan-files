Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th—The US side has yet to provide a responsible explanation for its series of atrocities in the POW camps on Geoje Island, Busan, Yeongcheon, etc., in which our captured personnel were massacred and mistreated. News of new atrocities continues to arrive. According to materials announced by the US side itself, in the first half of July, more than 40 of our captured personnel were beaten to death or injured by the US side.

    On Geoje Island, the US side beat to death or injured eight of our captured personnel on the 7th under the pretext of "riots"; on the 8th, the US side beat to death one more of our captured personnel; on the 13th, two more of our captured personnel were injured. In the Jeju Island POW camp, the US side injured four of our captured personnel. In the Yongcho Island POW camp, the US side injured four of our captured personnel. In the Sangmu-dae (transliteration) POW camp, the US side injured four of our captured personnel. The largest massacre took place in the Nonsan POW camp on the Korean mainland. The US side had long propagated that these POWs transferred to the mainland were all "anti-communist," but American soldiers beat to death or injured more than 20 of our captured personnel in this POW camp on the 9th. These atrocities show that the US side is clearly continuing to use bayonets to force our POWs to accept their so-called "screening" and so-called "voluntary repatriation."

    Simultaneous with these atrocities, the US side, disregarding our solemn warnings, unilaterally announced again on the 8th that it would transfer 3,700 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang under the name of "release." The United States Information Service, the official propaganda organ of the United States, continued to sing the old tune of wanting to detain 100,000 of our captured personnel on the 10th. The report submitted by Clark, commander-in-chief of the invading US forces in Korea, to the "United Nations" on the 13th also repeated the shameless lies that had long been completely bankrupt, saying that 100,000 of our captured personnel would rather commit suicide than be repatriated. At this time when peace hangs by a thread, all these actions and words of the US side are clearly intended to deliberately obstruct and delay negotiations.

### 美方继续屠杀战俘蓄意阻挠和拖延谈判

    美方继续屠杀战俘蓄意阻挠和拖延谈判
    【新华社开城十六日电】美方对于它在巨济岛、釜山、永川等战俘营中所犯的一连串屠杀和虐待我方被俘人员的暴行，一直到现在都还没有作负责的交代，而关于新的暴行的消息却又不断传来。根据美方自己宣布的材料，在七月上半月又有四十多名我方被俘人员被美方打死或打伤。
    在巨济岛上，美方在七日以“暴乱”的罪名打死打伤我方被俘人员八人；八日，美方又打死我方被俘人员一名；十三日，又有两名我方被俘人员被打伤。在济州岛战俘营中，美方打伤我方被俘人员四名。在龙草岛战俘营中，美方打伤我方被俘人员四名。在桑穆代（译音）战俘营中，美方打伤我方被俘人员四名。最大的一次屠杀是在朝鲜大陆上的论山战俘营中。美方早就宣传这些被移到大陆上的战俘都是“反共”的，可是美国士兵九日在这个战俘营中打死打伤我方被俘人员二十多人。这些暴行说明美方显然是在继续用刺刀尖强逼我方战俘接受他们的所谓“甄别”和所谓“自愿遣返”。
    和这些暴行同时，美方不顾我方的郑重警告，在八日又片面宣布以“释放”为名再将我方被俘人员三千七百名移交给李承晚匪帮。美国的官方宣传机关美国新闻处在十日继续唱着要扣留十万我方被俘人员的老调。侵朝美军总司令克拉克十三日向“联合国”提出的报告，也仍然重复早已彻底破产的无耻谎言，说什么十万我方被俘人员宁愿自杀也不愿遣返。在这和平系于一发的时候，美方的这一切行为和言论，显然是在蓄意阻挠和拖延谈判。
