Shanghai State-Owned No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory's Party Committee and administrative leading cadres do not value the wisdom of the workers, emphasizing numerous tasks and busy work, and neglecting the promotion of advanced production experiences. They mistakenly oppose the promotion of advanced experience to the central work, believing that: "Political movements (such as the "Three-Anti" campaign) and the atmosphere of promoting advanced experience are not harmonious." Therefore, they "fight alone" focusing solely on the movement, and even when the climax of the movement has long passed, they still do not lead or support the promotion of the advanced Hao Jianxiu working method and the 1951 weaving working method, resulting in the promotion of advanced experience becoming a mere formality.

Although most of the factory's workers have learned these two advanced working methods, very few are actually doing them. Most of the female spinning workers are outwardly "Hao Jianxiu" and secretly "Bai Jianxiu" (using their own methods). In the weaving workshop, it is even more difficult to find a few 1951 weaving workers. Once, the Shanghai Municipal Textile Industry Advanced Working Method Promotion Committee sent people to the factory for inspection. The factory's leading cadres became anxious and hurriedly asked the "little teachers" of the cloth factory to arrange things in order to cover up their mistakes.

The main reason why the promotion of advanced experience has become a mere formality is that the factory's Party and administrative leaders focus solely on movements, neglecting the implementation of advanced experience. In early November of last year, the Hao Jianxiu working method was promoted with emphasis within the Xu Fengying advanced production team, but after the democratic reform movement started, the promotion work was shelved for five months, and only resumed in April of this year. In February, the trainees of the 1951 weaving working method returned to the factory from the training class, ready to select a team to focus on trial promotion. Who knew that the Party Committee Secretary Chen Zhiping (now also the factory director) would summon them to talk, saying: "Now we must concentrate our efforts on the 'Three-Anti' campaign, and you can only set up small stalls temporarily to promote the working method." The then factory director Yu Huixiao (who has been dismissed for corruption) disagreed with the promotion team's request to add temporary workers, saying: "Adding temporary workers during the 'Three-Anti' campaign is a waste and not allowed." Many nominal members of the promotion organization never asked about anything, only six trainees were anxiously working there. They did not receive support from the leadership and cooperation from various parties, so they had to obey the order to "set up small stalls," teaching four people every two weeks. This "stall" was slowly expanded until the end of April.

The process of promoting advanced experience is inevitably a process of struggle between new and old ideas, and it cannot be smooth sailing. Therefore, during the promotion period, sufficient ideological mobilization and political education work must be carried out. The factory's leadership has done a very poor job in this regard, without giving a single factory-wide mobilization report on promoting advanced experience, let alone solving the various concerns and ideological problems of the masses in a timely manner. The masses' lack of understanding of advanced working methods has greatly hindered the promotion work. Some workers said: "I have been working for decades, and you still want these girls (referring to the little teachers) to teach me?" "What's so good about the working method? It's just being controlled by a cleaning board in the lane all day long. It's better to use the old method, which is lighter and faster." Under such circumstances, the little teachers' work was difficult, and they had to keep smiling despite being ridiculed and attacked. They repeatedly asked the leadership for support and solutions, but the leadership's response was: "We don't have time! You only know how to make reports, make reports. You don't know how much time it takes us to think about a report." In addition, the difficulties encountered in mechanical equipment and labor organization were not resolved, so even the little teachers were discouraged. The female workers in the weaving workshop generally held a "getting through" mentality, thinking: "The working method is national, and we will have to learn it sooner or later, so we might as well learn it while the weather is still cool."

The formalistic promotion of advanced experience is inseparable from the leadership's failure to attach importance to cultivating advanced production teams and giving play to their role as a banner. The Xu Fengying team was the first advanced team among Shanghai textile workers to challenge the Ma Hengchang team, the first to learn the Hao Jianxiu working method in the factory, and the first to challenge the Hao Jianxiu team. It had played a certain leading and promoting role in production. However, this advanced team, famous throughout the city, has never attracted the attention of the factory's Party Committee. Since the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions cadre who cultivated this team left the factory, the team has not been continuously cultivated and improved by the leadership. It is only asked to take the lead when a movement comes, and is left aside when the movement is over. This year, Xu Fengying went to Beijing to attend the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations. No one took control of the team's production. After she came back, she was invited by various parties to give reports in many places, up to twice a day. Once, Xu Fengying got off the night shift and hadn't slept for three hours when the Party Committee sent someone to wake her up to give a report. She felt that this would hinder the team's production even more and asked not to go, but the Party Committee comrades disagreed. When the team encountered difficulties in production, such as many crooked spindles and many people stopping work, the leadership did not specifically solve them. Therefore, in the May production competition, this advanced team had the lowest output and lost its role as a banner in production. This also affected the production enthusiasm of other workers. The workers in the spinning workshop said: "The Xu Fengying team has collapsed, what are we still doing?" The Party Committee was irresponsible and instead emphasized: "The foundation of the Xu Fengying team was originally bad."

### 上海国棉十六厂忽视推广先进工作法

    上海国棉十六厂忽视推广先进工作法
    国营上海第十六棉纺织厂党委会和行政领导干部，不重视工人的智慧，强调任务多、工作忙，忽视推广先进生产经验。他们错误地把推广先进经验的工作和中心工作对立起来，认为：“政治运动
    （如“三反”）和推广先进经验的空气不协调。”因此，就“单打一”的专搞运动，甚至在运动高潮早已过去的时候，对推广先进的郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法仍然不加领导和支持，致使推广先进经验工作流于形式。
    该厂大部分工人虽已学过这两种先进工作法，但实际在做的却没有几个人。细纱女工大部分是明里“郝建秀”、暗里“白建秀”。布机间里，更难找到几个一九五一织布工作者。有一次，上海市纺织工业先进工作法推广委员会派人下厂检查，该厂领导干部着了急，连忙要布厂小先生布置一番，把错误掩饰过去。
    推广先进经验的工作所以流于形式的主要原因是该厂党及行政领导上单搞运动，忽视先进经验的推行。去年十一月初，郝建秀工作法曾在厂内徐凤英先进生产小组重点推行，但是民主改革运动搞起来后，推广工作一搁就搁了五个月，到今年四月间才恢复。二月里，一九五一织布工作法的学员们从学习班回厂，准备选择一个小组重点试行推广。谁知党委书记陈志平（现兼厂长）却召集她们谈话说：
    “现在我们要集中力量搞‘三反’，你们搞工作法暂时只好摆摆小摊头”。当时的厂长喻会孝（因贪污，已被撤职）对推广组增添临时工的要求表示不同意，他说：“‘三反’期间，添临时工是浪费，不可以”。推广机构里的许多挂名委员从来不问事，只有六个学员在那里干着急。他们得不到领导上的支持和各方面的配合，也只得奉命“摆小摊头”，每两个礼拜教上四个人，这样一直“摆”到四月底，“摊头”才慢慢扩大。
    先进经验的推广过程必然是新旧思想斗争的过程，不可能是一帆风顺的。因此，在推广期间必须进行充分的思想动员和政治教育工作。这一点，该厂领导方面做得很差，没有作过一次全厂性的推广先进经验的动员报告，更谈不上及时解决群众的各种顾虑和思想问题，群众对先进工作法认识不足，使推广工作受到很大的阻碍。有些工人说：“我做了几十年工啦，还叫这些丫头（指小先生）来教？”“工作法好啥？只是一天到晚让一块擦板管牢在弄堂里，还不如老一套办法，跑起路来轻快些。”在这样的情况下，小先生工作难做，她们受到讽刺和打击，还要陪笑脸。她们再三要求领导上支持、解决，而领导上回答的是：“我们没空啊！你们只知道做报告、做报告，不知道做一个报告我们要想多少辰光。”加上机械设备上和劳动组织上遇到的困难，也没有得到解决，因此连小先生都灰心了。布机间女工相当普遍地抱着一种过关思想，她们认为：“工作法是全国性的，迟早要学，还不如乘天还凉学了算数。”
    推广先进经验的工作流于形式与领导上不重视培养先进生产小组，发挥它的旗帜作用也是分不开的。该厂徐凤英小组是上海市纺织工人中第一个向马恒昌小组应战、在厂内首先学习郝建秀工作法并向郝建秀小组应战的先进小组，在生产上曾起过一定的带头和推动作用。但是这一个全市闻名的先进小组一向没有引起该厂党委会的重视，自培养这个小组的上海总工会下厂干部离厂后，小组就没有得到领导上的继续培养与提高，只是运动来了，要它带一个头，运动过去了，就把它搁在一边。今年徐凤英到北京参加“五一”劳动节观礼，小组生产更无人掌握，她回来后，又应各方面的邀请四出作报告，一天多到两次。有一次，徐凤英下夜班，还没有睡上三个钟点，党委会就派人叫醒她去作报告。她感到这样做更会妨碍小组的生产，要求不去，党委会同志不同意；组里生产上发生困难，如歪锭子多，停工的人多，领导上也不具体解决。因此，五月份生产竞赛中，这个先进小组产量最低，失去了生产上的旗帜作用。这也影响其他工人的生产积极性。细纱间工人说：“徐凤英小组都垮了，我们还搅什么。”党委会不负责任，反强调说：
    “徐凤英小组的基础原来就坏”。
