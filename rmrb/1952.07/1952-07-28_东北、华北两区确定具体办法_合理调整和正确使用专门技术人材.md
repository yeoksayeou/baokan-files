Northeast and North China Regions Determine Specific Measures
    Rational Adjustment and Correct Use of Specialized Technical Personnel

The Northeast People's Government and the North China Administrative Council have successively determined measures for the correct use of specialized technical personnel. The Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has already transferred a group of specialized technical personnel to work in factories and workshops.

The Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government, in order to change the unreasonable phenomena in the use of technical personnel in various places, convened a meeting of personnel cadres from the Northeast Greater Administrative Region's level organs and various business systems on June 28th. After listening to reports from various units on the use of technical personnel, the meeting concluded that the Northeast region had basically implemented the principle of "integrating learning with application" in the past in the use of technical personnel; however, there were also unreasonable phenomena in some departments. The first phenomenon was that specialized technical personnel were doing administrative work or general technical work. For example, in the Secretariat Section of the Northeast People's Government's Health Department, a graduate of a six-year medical university was doing file classification work. Of the 28 cadres in the department's Personnel Section, 19 were technical personnel. At the Industry Section of the General Affairs Department of the Northeast Office of the Ministry of Railways, an architectural engineer was doing property management work. The second type was that people with Category A specialized skills were doing Category B specialized skills work, the so-called "stone mason doing blacksmith's work." For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau assigned metallurgy graduates to work in the electromechanical group of the design office, which was not only not beneficial to the work but also restricted the technical personnel from发挥 (fāhuī - giving full play to) their expertise. The third type was that some technical departments had redundant technical cadres, preventing potential strength from being发挥 (fāhuī - giving full play to). The meeting believed that the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena were mainly due to the parochialism of the leading cadres in certain departments, in addition to historical reasons. In addition, insufficient understanding of the situation and rough work by the personnel departments were also reasons. The meeting decided to put the above-mentioned specialized technical personnel in the most needed positions in economic construction. The work steps are: first, all levels of personnel work cadres are required to study relevant documents on the rational use of technical personnel, and formulate specific plans based on the situation of their own departments, and implement them after being reviewed and approved by higher-level leading organs. In the adjustment work, it is necessary to grasp the key departments; at the same time, pay attention to general departments; conduct in-depth inspections and report in a timely manner, so as to ensure that the problems are reasonably resolved. In addition, the primary and secondary should be distinguished, and the departments where the use of technical personnel is completely unreasonable should be dealt with first. The adjustment method is: first, adjustments should be made within the department. If there are indeed no suitable positions in the department to place them, report to the higher-level organs for handling. This adjustment work is required to be completed by the Northeast-level organs before the end of July, and by their affiliated units before the end of September; other departments should complete it before the end of August.

The North China Administrative Council recently conducted a preliminary inspection of the use of specialized technical personnel in the departments under its jurisdiction. The inspection results indicated that the use of most of the 180 university graduates (referring to the 1951 university graduates) working in the departments under the North China Administrative Council was in line with the principle of "integrating learning with application"; however, it was also found that the use of 19 cadres was not in line with the principle of "integrating learning with application". For example, Song Yun'e and Shao Ganxin, graduates of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the 工学院 (Gōngxuéyuàn - Institute of Technology), were working as secretaries and in transportation administration in the Industrial Bureau's office. Regarding this unreasonable use of cadres, the North China Administrative Council has decided to immediately make adjustments; and has decided to first make adjustments within the department, and if suitable positions still cannot be found, the Civil Affairs Bureau will assign them to suitable factories, mines, or relevant departments. The vacancies after the cadre adjustments will be filled by cadres with a middle school education. Currently, the various departments under the North China Administrative Council are continuing to inspect the use of specialized personnel. In addition, the North China Administrative Council has issued a notice ordering all provinces and cities to inspect the use of specialized technical personnel.

The Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has made preliminary adjustments to the use of specialized technical personnel. The department has decided to send some engineers to factories and workshops to be responsible for production work, and also send technicians, trainees, and chemists to workshops or research departments to directly participate in production or work. A total of 19 technical personnel were transferred from the department to the factories, including 5 engineers and 14 technicians and trainees; a total of 15 people were transferred from the affiliated companies to the factories, including 3 engineers and 12 technicians, trainees, and chemists. The department is continuing to understand the situation regarding the use of technical personnel.

    东北、华北两区确定具体办法
    合理调整和正确使用专门技术人材
    东北人民政府、华北行政委员会已先后确定正确使用专门技术人材的办法。山西省人民政府工业厅已抽调一批专门技术人员到工厂车间工作。
    东北人民政府人事部为了改变各地在使用技术人材上的不合理现象，在六月二十八日召集东北大行政区一级机关及各业务系统的人事干部举行会议。会议听取了各单位关于技术人材使用情况的汇报后，认为东北地区过去对技术人材的使用，基本上贯彻了“学用一致”的原则；但在某些部门也有使用不合理的现象。第一种现象是专门技术人材做了行政工作或一般技术工作。如东北人民政府卫生部秘书科，有一个六年制医科大学毕业生做着文件分类工作。该部人事处二十八名干部中，有十九名是技术人员。在铁道部东北办事处总务部产业科，有一个建筑工程师做着房产管理工作。第二种是具有甲种专门技术的人做了乙种专门技术工作，即所谓“石匠干铁匠活”。如抚顺矿务局把学冶金的人员分配到设计处机电组工作，这不但对工作没有好处，且限制了技术人员发挥其专长。第三种是有些技术部门的技术干部人浮于事，使潜在力量不得发挥。会议认为所以产生上述不合理现象，除了历史原因以外，主要因为某些部门的领导干部有着本位主义思想。另外，人事部门了解情况不够、工作粗糙也是原因之一。会议决定把上述专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去。工作步骤是：首先要求各级人事工作干部学习有关合理使用技术人材的文件，并根据本部门的情况，订出具体计划，经上级领导机关审定执行。在调整工作中，要抓住重点部门；同时注意一般部门；深入检查、及时汇报，务使问题得到合理解决。此外，应分出主次，首先处理使用技术人材完全不合理的部门。调整方法是：首先在本部门进行调整，本部门确无适当岗位可以安插的，报请上级机关处理。这一调整工作，要求东北一级机关在七月末以前，其所属各单位在九月末以前做好；其他部门在八月末以前做好。
    华北行政委员会最近在所属各厅、会、局初步检查了专门技术人材的使用情况。检查结果指明，在华北行政委员会所属各部门工作的一百八十名大学毕业生（指一九五一年度大学毕业生），绝大部分人的使用是符合“学用一致”的原则的；但也发现有十九名干部的使用不符合“学用一致”的原则。如工学院机械系毕业生宋云鹗、邵淦薪，在工业局办公室作秘书工作和交通行政工作。对这种使用干部不合理的情况，华北行政委员会已决定立即进行调整；并确定先在本部门范围内进行调整，如仍不能找到适当岗位的，即由民政局分配他们到适宜的厂矿或有关部门去。干部调整后的缺额，将由中学程度的干部补充。现在，华北行政委员会所属各厅、会、局仍在继续检查专门人材的使用情况。此外，华北行政委员会已发出通知，责成各省、市检查专门技术人员的使用情况。
    山西省人民政府工业厅已对专门技术人材的使用做了初步调整。该厅已决定将一些工程师派到工厂车间去负责生产工作，将技术员、见习员、化验员等也派到车间或研究部门直接参加生产或工作。这次由厅调到工厂的技术人员共十九人，其中有工程师五人，技术人员、见习人员十四人；由所属各公司调到工厂的共十五人，其中有工程师三人，技术人员、见习人员、化验人员十二人。该厅正继续了解对技术人员的使用情况。
