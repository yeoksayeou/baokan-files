Children, I Envy You!
	Chen Zhuyin

	In late June, during a report by Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the Central Ministry of Education, I heard about another adjustment to the People's Scholarship for universities and secondary schools nationwide. I am happy for the fortunate younger generation and their parents. As a mother of eight children, I have exhausted my efforts to raise tuition fees and have helplessly watched bright and studious children drop out of school. Therefore, I deeply appreciate the Party and the People's Government's motherly care for young people.
	My husband was Zhu Ziqing. Some comrades may remember him: the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous policies, the dark social system, and the heavy family burden suffocated him, and he left the world with regret. He was a university professor for more than thirty years, contributing everything to education, but our children dropped out of school during their school years.
	Ziqing's salary alone supported the lives of twelve people, and we often couldn't afford to send our children to school after paying for food. Every time school was about to start, paying tuition became our difficulty. I remember in the autumn of 1934, we requested a month's salary from the school authorities, promising to repay it in installments over six months, and that's how we managed to get through the "difficulty." But the "difficulty" of 1935 came immediately after. How could we raise the tuition fees for five children? After many discussions, my husband and I borrowed 100 yuan from a certain gentleman, explaining that we would repay it in installments over five months. The gentleman generously agreed, but when it came time to pay the tuition, he couldn't lend it to us. Since this path was blocked, we had to resort to selling things. It was at this time that I painfully sold the commemorative ring my mother gave me before her death, as well as our engagement ring and leather coat, to raise enough tuition fees for the children. In 1941, my second daughter had only one semester left to graduate from high school. She studied hard and had good grades. We couldn't bear to let her give up this last semester. However, we really had nothing left to sell, so we had to sell some books and Ziqing's beloved calligraphy copybook and a Duan inkstone. It was so painful for us to be reduced to selling books and inkstones!
	Our struggles and efforts failed to save our children from dropping out of school. My eldest son dropped out of school in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, just as he was in the second year of high school. A few years later, the second son dropped out of middle school before finishing, and the third daughter dropped out of elementary school before finishing. I am a very maternal person, worrying about the children's schooling every day. As a result, the children dropped out of school, which was a heavy blow to me!
	Recalling the days of Ziqing's death, I still feel terrified now. His death was a fatal blow to our whole family. At that time, I dared not think about the future. How could I maintain the family's life and the education expenses of three children with my meager salary? My heart was broken. Even seeing the sun, I felt it was gray. At this critical moment, our savior came, and Mao Zedong's sunshine shone on us.
	In New China, we have completely different circumstances. The Party and the People's Government respect everyone who has contributed to society. Our family has been taken care of: my two sons and one daughter have entered middle and elementary schools free of charge, and our lives have been effectively guaranteed. We began to feel the joy of life. This year, among the eight children, for the first time as a mother, I don't have to worry and will easily and happily send one child to university and one child to middle school. When our family sits together and talks, we no longer sigh and lament about not being able to pay tuition fees, nor do we calculate every penny for tomorrow's food. We now talk about the children's work and study, good news in the newspapers, as well as "ideological issues" and production and construction issues. The children's progress amazes me. I remember when I was in my twenties, I was still confused. Today, my eleven-year-old daughter can talk about things in a set of ways, explaining various principles. She sometimes tells me: "Mom, you can't just look at one side of the problem, you have to look at the other side too!" The children are full of beautiful ideals, full of confidence in realizing their ideals, and deeply infect me. Once, the children told me with radiant faces: "Mom, you will definitely see socialist society, see communist society, definitely." At this time, I really felt younger.
	Today, the Party and the People's Government have taken on the responsibility of raising and educating children for mothers, arranged a good learning environment for the children, and arranged a path to happiness. Children growing up in the Mao Zedong era, I envy you, you are so happy!

### 孩子们，我羡慕你们！

    孩子们，我羡慕你们！
    陈竹隐
    六月下旬，在中央教育部钱俊瑞副部长的一次报告里，我听到又一次调整全国高等学校及中等学校人民助学金的消息。我为幸福的年轻一代和他们的家长们高兴。我是一个共有八个孩子的母亲，曾为筹措孩子们的学费耗尽心血，曾眼睁睁看着聪明好学的孩子失学；因此我对于党和人民政府慈母般关怀青年的措施，是体会得很深刻的。
    我的丈夫是朱自清。提起他，有些同志还记得：国民党反动派的卖国政策，黑暗的社会制度，沉重的家庭负担，压得他出不得气，含恨离开了人间。他当了三十多年的大学教授，为教育事业贡献了自己的一切，但是，我们的几个孩子却在念书的年龄失学了。
    自清一个人的薪金收入，负担着十二口人的生活，我们常常是顾了吃饭，便不能供给孩子们念书。每当学校放假的时候，我们便开始为孩子们下学期的学费发愁。每当要开学时，缴学费就成了我们的难关。记得一九三四年的秋季，我们曾请求学校当局借一个月薪水，言明半年扣还，这样才勉强度过“难关”。但一九三五年的“难关”紧接着又来了，五个孩子的学费怎样筹措呢？我们夫妇多次商议的结果，向某君借洋一百元，说明五个月分期归还，承某君慨允了；但临缴学费时，某君又不能借给我们了。此路不通，只好走当卖东西的一条路了。就在这次，我忍痛把母亲临死时给我的纪念戒指卖掉，又卖了我们的订婚戒指和皮大衣，才筹足孩子们的学费。在一九四一年，我的二女儿在高中还有一个学期就毕业了，她学习努力，成绩很好，我们不忍让她放弃这最后的一学期。但是，我们实在没有东西可卖了，只好卖掉一部分书和自清心爱的一本字帖、一个端砚。教书的人竟到了卖掉书砚的地步，这对我们是多大的痛苦啊！
    我们的挣扎和努力并未能挽救孩子们失学的命运。我的最大的男孩子在抗战初期，正是高中二年级，就失学了。几年以后，第二个男孩初中没念完，三女儿小学都没念完，便失学了。我是个母性很重的人，每天为孩子们的上学问题耽心，结果孩子失学了，这给我的打击是多么沉重啊！
    回想起自清去世的日子，我现在还感到可怕。他的去世对我们全家来说，是个致命的打击。那时，我不敢想未来的时光。靠我这一点微薄的薪金，怎样维持全家的生活和三个孩子的教育费呢？我的心碎裂了。甚至看到太阳，都感到是灰色的。就在这岌岌可危的时刻，我们的救星来到了，毛泽东的阳光照到我们身上来了。
    在新中国，我们有了完全不同的境遇。党和人民政府尊重每一个对社会有过贡献的人；我们家受到了照顾：我的两个男孩子和一个女孩子免费进入中学和小学校，我们的生活得到切实的保障。我们开始感到生的欢乐。今年，在八个孩子中间，我做母亲的第一次不用操心，将要轻松愉快地送一个孩子升入大学，一个孩子进入中学。我们一家人围坐谈天的时候，已再不因缴不上学费而长吁短叹，也不再斤斤计算明天的食粮了。我们现在谈的是孩子们的工作和学习、报纸上的好消息，也谈“思想问题”和生产建设问题。孩子们的进步使我感到惊奇。我记得自己二十多岁的时候，还糊里糊涂；今天，十一岁的小女儿谈起事情来，已经是一套又一套地讲述各种道理了。她有时告诉我：“妈妈，看问题不能光看一面，还要看另外一面啊！”孩子们充满着美丽的理想，充满着实现理想的信心，并深深感染着我。有一次，孩子们满脸光彩地告诉我：“妈妈，您一定能看到社会主义社会，看到共产主义社会，一定的。”这时，我真的觉得自己年轻起来了。
    今天，党和人民政府替母亲们担负起了教养孩子的责任，为孩子们安排好了良好的学习环境，安排好了通往幸福的道路。生长在毛泽东时代的孩子们，我羡慕你们，你们是多么幸福啊！
