Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 22nd: The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened an all-army art performance review conference in early July to review the achievements of the army's art work, exchange experiences in art work, and select outstanding programs in response to an invitation from the General Political Department of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission to return home and participate in the People's Liberation Army Founding Day celebration performance. Writers such as Liu Baiyu, who are on the Korean front, were also invited to participate in the evaluation work of the conference. Twenty-six art work units participated in this performance review conference, including members of song and dance troupes, members of cultural work teams, and representatives of amateur soldier theater groups, totaling 407 people. A total of 120 art programs were performed, of which 15 were compiled and performed by soldiers. After review and discussion, 25 outstanding programs (including 125 actors and orchestra members) were finally selected to participate in the "August 1st" Army Day celebration performance. At the end of the review conference, Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, writer Liu Baiyu, and others made summary and special reports, and Director Gan Siqi personally presented souvenirs to the participating units.

This art performance review conference demonstrated the great achievements of the art work in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in following and implementing Chairman Mao's artistic direction of "facing the company and serving the soldiers." The 120 programs that participated in the performance covered all aspects of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's combat and life. The vast majority of them praised the deeds of the heroic people. In addition, some reflected the powerful modernization of our army's logistics and transportation work; some reflected the struggle of the Volunteer Army's artillery and air defense forces; some used artistic forms to cooperate with the tactical and technical education of the troops; some expressed the soldiers' love for revolutionary weapons and materials supported by the motherland; some reflected the healthy and optimistic mood and the spirit of overcoming difficulties in our army's position life; some programs reflected the close friendship between the Chinese and Korean people; some programs expressed our army's anger and contempt for the US imperialists' bacteriological warfare crimes and the widespread and in-depth health movement; and some programs expressed the soldiers' spicy satire of US imperialism. Because all the members of the song and dance troupe and the cultural work team can go deep into the company, deep into the battlefield, and deep into the work site to combine with the soldiers and the masses, these programs can profoundly express our army's patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, express the soldiers' true feelings, and thus can encourage the morale of the troops, improve the soldiers' class consciousness, and ensure the completion of various tasks. For example, "One Grenade, One Bag of Candy" (story song) uses a sharp contrast between a naive and lovely Korean girl being killed by American planes and happy Chinese children warmly comforting the Volunteer Army, which makes people deeply feel the brutality of American imperialism and the lofty quality and firm will of the Volunteer Army fighting to defend children, defend mothers, and defend world peace; "New Cotton-padded Jacket" (solo) and "Cotton Military Uniform" (drum ballad) describe the Volunteer Army soldiers' infinite gratitude to the people of the motherland when they received the cotton-padded military uniform from the motherland last autumn; "Tunnel Warfare" (Sichuan storytelling) writes about the Volunteer Army soldiers' firm confidence in victory and heroic struggle; "Position Life" (crosstalk 'soldier creation' performance) expresses the revolutionary optimism of the soldiers' position life and vividly and profoundly reflects the vigorous morale of our army fighting for peace; "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa" (fast-talking story 'soldier creation' performance) describes in great detail the deeds of reconnaissance personnel going deep behind enemy lines to fight, exposing the enemy's crazy aggressive ambitions and the enemy's embarrassment after failure; "Four Seasons Tune" (solo 'soldier creation' performance) reflects the cook's joy, optimism, and the revolutionary friendship between the cook and the soldiers, which is very touching.

From the perspective of artistic form, the 120 programs performed this time adopted a variety of artistic forms such as songs, singing, fast-talking stories, clapper talks, dances, drum ballads, crosstalk, storytelling,坠子 (zhuìzi, a type of folk singing), rhythmic storytelling, foreign films, 单弦 (dānxián, a type of folk singing), song and dance, song and dance drama, clapper talk drama, living newspaper, lotus flower fall, acting, tongue twisters, and instrumental music performances. Not only that, these artistic forms have also undergone new developments in the Volunteer Army. For example, clapper talk now has call-and-response clapper talk, collective clapper talk, clapper talk dance, and clapper talk drama, which makes the originally monotonous clapper talk possible to express more complex life. The characteristics of these forms are that they are short and concise, easy to perform in a combat environment, and therefore loved by the vast number of soldiers.

After reviewing the performances of the Volunteer Army's art programs, Director Gan Siqi pointed out in his summary: In the future, song and dance troupes and cultural work teams should regard helping to establish soldiers' amateur theater groups as an important task, and require that there be a revolutionary, majestic, and joyful cultural life in every corner of the army. From the programs performed this time, the soldiers and the masses showed great talent and wisdom in literary and artistic activities. Director Gan Siqi pointed out: Only on the basis of popularization can we talk about improvement; in addition to vigorously engaging in popularization work, the song and dance troupes and cultural work teams should also pay attention to improving artistry, which requires rich and sincere emotions, the spirit of collective heroism, and the performance and playing skills should be more proficient, more beautiful, and more coordinated, so that literary and artistic work can better serve the victory of the war.

    人民志愿军举行全军文艺演出检阅大会
    并选出精彩节目归国参加解放军建军节庆祝大会的演出
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】中国人民志愿军政治部于本月上旬召开全军文艺演出检阅大会，检阅全军文艺工作的成绩；交流文艺工作经验；并选出精彩节目，应中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部的邀请，归国参加人民解放军建军节庆祝大会的演出。在朝鲜前线的作家刘白羽等也应邀参加大会的评判工作。参加这次演出检阅大会的有二十六个文艺工作单位，包括文工团团员，文工队队员及战士业余剧团代表共四百零七人。参加演出的文艺节目共一百二十个，其中战士编演的节目占十五个。经审查讨论，最后选出二十五个精彩节目（包括演员及乐队队员一百二十五人），参加“八一”建军节庆祝大会的演出。检阅大会最后由中国人民志愿军政治部主任甘泗淇、作家刘白羽等做总结及专题报告，并由甘泗淇主任亲自发纪念品给参加演出的单位。
    这次文艺演出检阅大会，表现出了中国人民志愿军中的文艺工作遵循和贯彻毛主席“面向连队、为兵服务”文艺方向的巨大成绩。参加演出的一百二十个节目，从内容方面看，包括了中国人民志愿军战斗与生活的各个方面。其中绝大多数是歌颂英雄人民的事迹。此外有的是反映了我军强大的近代化的后勤、运输工作；有的是反映了志愿军的炮兵和防空部队的斗争；有的是用艺术形式配合部队的战术和技术教育；有的表现了战士们对革命武器和从祖国支援的物资的热爱；有的反映了我军阵地生活中的健康的乐观的情绪及克服困难的精神；有些节目反映了中朝人民之间的亲密友谊；有些节目表现了我军对美帝国主义细菌战罪行的愤怒与鄙视及广泛深入的卫生运动；更有些节目表现了战士对美帝国主义的辛辣的讽刺。由于全体文工团团员，文工队队员平时能够深入连队、深入战地、深入工作现场与战士群众相结合，所以这些节目就能够深刻地表现我军的爱国主义、国际主义与革命英雄主义的精神，表现了战士的真情实感，因而能够鼓舞部队的斗志，提高战士的阶级觉悟，保证各项任务的完成。如“一粒投弹一包糖”（故事歌）以一个天真可爱的朝鲜小女孩被美国飞机打死，与愉快幸福的中国孩子热情地慰问志愿军的强烈对比，使人深深感到美帝国主义的残暴和志愿军为保卫孩子、保卫母亲、保卫世界和平而战的崇高品质和坚强意志；“新棉袄”（独唱）“棉军装”（大鼓）描写出了志愿军战士在去年秋天领到祖国运来的棉军装时对祖国人民无限感激的心情；“坑道战”（四川评书）写出了志愿军战士坚强的胜利信心和英勇斗争的事迹；“阵地生活”（相声‘战士创作’演出）表现了战士阵地生活中的革命乐观主义，生动而深刻地反映了我军为和平而战斗的旺盛的士气；“侦察英雄韩起发”（快书‘战士创作’演出）十分细致地描写了侦察员深入敌后斗争事迹，揭露了敌人疯狂的侵略野心和敌人在失败后的狼狈相；“四季调”（独唱‘战士创作’演出）反映了炊事员的愉快、乐观及炊事员与战士之间的革命友爱，感人很深。
    从艺术形式上看，这次所演出的一百二十个节目，采取了歌曲、演唱、快书、快板、舞蹈、大鼓、相声、评书、坠子、数来宝、洋片、单弦、歌舞、歌舞剧、快板剧、活报、莲花落、演戏、绕口令、乐器演奏等多种多样的艺术形式；不仅如此，这些艺术形式在志愿军中还有了新的发展，例如快板现在就已经有了对口快板、集体快板、快板舞、快板剧，这就使原是很单调的快板有可能表现比较复杂的生活。这些形式的特点是短小精悍，便于在战斗环境中演出，因而为广大战士所喜爱。
    在检阅了志愿军文艺节目的演出以后，甘泗淇主任在总结中指出：今后文工团、文工队应把帮助建立战士业余剧团当作重要任务，要求在全军的每一个角落都有革命的、雄壮愉快的文化生活，从这次演出的节目看，战士群众在文艺活动中是表现了极大的天才与智慧的。甘泗淇主任指出：只有在普及的基础上才能谈到提高；各文工团、文工队除了大力地从事普及的工作外，还应该注意提高艺术性，这就是要求有丰富真切的感情，有集体英雄主义的气概，演、奏技巧上应该更纯熟、更优美、更协调，以便文艺工作更好地为战争的胜利服务。
