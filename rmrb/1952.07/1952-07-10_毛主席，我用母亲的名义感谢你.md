    Chairman Mao, I Thank You in the Name of My Mother
    Yang Baohua
    I took the train from Shanghai to Beijing, and I couldn't suppress my joy and excitement along the way. I knew very well that I was on my way to Beijing, to Chairman Mao's side. Every minute and every second, I was getting closer to the heart of our motherland—Beijing, closer to our Chairman Mao. How could I not be happy and excited!
    I walked to Tiananmen Square and bowed deeply toward Chairman Mao's loving image. I seemed to really see Chairman Mao standing there, waving to me like he did to the marching crowds during the National Day celebrations. Yes, Chairman Mao, you are always facing us. The people walking in front of Tiananmen Square all looked at me, as if saying, "Yes! We are just like you, we also sincerely thank our father—Mao Zedong."
    I am an intellectual. Thirty years ago, I married a doctor. At first, everything seemed fine, but later it didn't work out. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policies made our lives harder day by day. Our savings in the bank dwindled day by day, and our living standards declined day by day. At that time, I didn't know that it was Chiang Kai-shek who was making our lives difficult. Later, the sound of the Anti-Japanese War cannons excited us. We donated all our foreign currency, all our silverware, and even my little girl's beloved little silver spoon. But soon, all of this went into the pockets of the bureaucratic capitalists. Chiang Kai-shek made us fools and dampened our patriotic enthusiasm.
    After the Anti-Japanese War, life became even more difficult. We still had a considerable amount of savings in the bank, which was meant for the children's education and marriage expenses. My husband, with his national pride and honest conscience, was unwilling to use this money to speculate or hoard goods, nor was he willing to exchange it for puppet currency. He kept it in the bank, still fantasizing that the country would not let him suffer after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this sum of money only became enough for a month's worth of toilet paper.
    Life was difficult. If I were to recall those days now, it would be unbearable. Our worries about life were secondary. As parents, we were particularly concerned about our children's future. The children grew up slowly, but in Shanghai, shrouded in the decadent ideology of American imperialism, our children's education was so difficult. Every mother will understand my heart. Our hearts for our children, our concern for our children are the same. We truly poured our hearts and souls into expecting our children to grow up and become useful people. However, in that environment, everything was so heartbreaking!
    The children in school seemed to be left unattended. At that time, we mistakenly believed that missionary schools were the best schools, so we sent our children there to be educated. However, the children changed. At school, they learned to enjoy themselves. If their pants were patched, my eldest child would cry and refuse to wear them to school. If they didn't have new leather shoes, my second child wouldn't speak for days. If they didn't have a coat made, my eldest daughter wouldn't eat. The children often made a fuss to eat better snacks. The children also learned to curse and deceive. I will never forget that once my second child used a deceptive method at school to obtain an extra holiday. When we found out, he said he learned it from a foreign priest's story. Those who imitated him were considered heroes among the classmates. Because he wanted to be a hero, he learned to deceive. At that time, my husband was so sad that he couldn't eat his dinner. He said to me at night, "I have lost confidence for the first time, lost confidence in my children. I worry about their future!" But the worst was yet to come!
    Towards the end of the Anti-Japanese War, our lives were really unbearable. A doctor's income could not support so many people in the family. We ate sweet potatoes and coarse grains. We dismissed the rickshaw puller, and the maids went from three to two, then to one, and finally none. All the housework for eight children and my husband was borne by me. From that time on, I didn't have time to read newspapers or books for several years, and I was busy with housework all day long. And doing housework only exhausted my body, while the children's degeneration pained my heart. A greater heartbreak finally happened. One day, my second child suddenly didn't want to go to school anymore. He said that he wanted to learn how to do business and make money. You see, he was completely corrupted by the decadent bourgeois ideology! When he first brought this up, I was sewing clothes and was so surprised that I stabbed my finger with the needle without even feeling the pain. His father was trembling with a newspaper in his hand. We tried to persuade him, scold him, and even beat him. Every mother has experienced how painful it is to beat a child, but it was useless. He gave countless examples to prove that he was right. He said that many knowledgeable and moral people around us were starving, while many ignorant and immoral people had become rich by doing business. What could we say to answer him?
    The Anti-Japanese War was won, and we fully expected our lives to improve from then on, but soon we realized that the reality was even worse. The children were getting worse and worse. My eldest child, also a smart child, was studying at St. John's University at the time of the victory. I really couldn't understand how students in school, under the corrosion of American imperialist decadent culture, would start doing business while attending school. He made money and spent it recklessly. We advised him, but he turned a deaf ear and didn't listen at all. With a mother's unique sensitivity to her child, I noticed that he was getting thinner. He didn't speak as simply and honestly as before. He became hypocritical and vulgar. As a mother, I was really sad!
    Later, my second child had some changes. It turned out that he had met a Communist Party member. Smart and decisive, he immediately accepted the education given to him by this glorious Communist Party member, and he began to improve. I will always remember this humble and honest Communist Party member with gratitude. Soon, my second child stopped doing business and returned to university to study again. At the beginning of 1947, he finally went to the liberated area. He went to our sun, to the place of our benefactor, Chairman Mao.
    However, the other children became worse in the unforgivable social environment. The third child hummed unpleasant and frivolous songs all day long, wore trousers with small legs, carried American military dog tags, and also learned to smoke and dance. Alas, he was not even twenty years old yet! My eldest daughter was studying in a missionary girls' school, and she was constantly making a fuss about buying this and that, which really pained me. She also learned to go to dance halls with her classmates. Her leather shoes had not been worn many times, but she complained that the style was outdated and wanted to buy new ones. Her clothes also had to be constantly changed in style. Everything was learned from American magazines and American movies. It is said that she was considered one of the more honest ones among her classmates! At that time, I often couldn't sleep. As soon as I closed my eyes, the shadows of the children, the shadows of them gradually degenerating, appeared before my eyes. What would their future be like? The more I thought about it, the more painful I felt. My husband often said to me, "I don't gamble, I don't dance, I am an honest person, but our children are like that...!" We were both getting older and older. I often thought of Mr. Lu Xun's words, "Save the children." I also want to shout loudly: "Save my children!"
    Fortunately, it's alright! Shanghai was liberated, New China was born, the sun rose—Chairman Mao came. Our life has undergone a change—an indescribable huge change! My second child returned wearing a gray military uniform, full of vigor, and returned victoriously with Chairman Mao's troops. He brought me countless books, countless truths, and countless words of Chairman Mao. He took the third child and the eldest daughter to Beijing to study in Chairman Mao's place. At the beginning of 1950, the third child and the eldest daughter joined the glorious People's Liberation Army and also joined the New Democratic Youth League. Under the teaching of Chairman Mao, they recognized the truth, obeyed the truth, and struggled for the truth. They returned the money I sent them, saying that life outside was very good and they didn't need money. They returned the things I sent them, saying that the revolutionary army should have a hard-working and simple style, and there was no need to send things. They also returned my inappropriate sentimentality. They were completely different from the past.
    After liberation, life got better day by day, and I no longer had to worry about price fluctuations. Under the appeal of Mao Zedong Thought, the eldest child resolutely left Shanghai and went to the Northeast, where he was most needed. The photos he sent showed that he was getting fatter day by day, and the words in his letters were becoming more and more simple and kind. He had become my beloved eldest child again.
    After graduating from junior high school, my fifth child responded to the school's call and went to the Northeast Post and Telecommunications School to study. I still had some selfish thoughts at that time. I couldn't bear to let him leave me. I sent telegrams and wrote letters to ask him to come back. He sent a reply with several large characters written on it saying, "The motherland needs it, the people need it, the organization needs it, do you understand, Mom?" After reading these words, my selfish thoughts were dispelled. I was so happy that tears fell down. I read these words over and over again. I was so happy! I thought: He is only fourteen years old. Who else besides the Communist Party, besides Chairman Mao, could have made him so strong?
    My second and third daughters are both in elementary school. Under the guidance of the New Democratic education, they have all become glorious Young Pioneers. Seeing their red scarves, I felt indescribably happy. I was relieved, and I didn't have to worry about their future anymore!
    Chairman Mao brought sunshine and spring to my family. My family is now very lively. At night, we talk and laugh, carefree. We fall asleep as soon as we lie down at night. I don't have to worry about anything anymore. We have Chairman Mao, we have the Communist Party. I became younger again, my face regained its color, and my white hair decreased. My little girl often touches my face at night and says, "Mom, you often smile now. I haven't seen you unhappy for a long, long time."
    Whenever I think of our happy life, I always thank Chairman Mao. I think to myself, for all the children, for all the mothers, how should I thank him? The children knew what I meant. My naughty fifth child came up with a good idea for me. He said, "You go to Beijing, go to Chairman Mao's place, go and see Tiananmen Square, see Chairman Mao's portrait on Tiananmen Square." So, at the beginning of this year, my husband and I came to Beijing, to the place where Chairman Mao lives.
    Now, in front of Tiananmen Square, Chairman Mao, looking at the place where you stood, looking at your portrait, I bow deeply. I want to say: "Respected Chairman Mao, our savior, our father, in the name of my mother, I thank you, I sincerely thank you, Chairman Mao, infinitely thank you!"

### 毛主席，我用母亲的名义感谢你

    毛主席，我用母亲的名义感谢你
    杨宝华
    我从上海坐火车到北京，一路上我无法抑制我的高兴、激动。我清清楚楚地知道，我是正在到北京去，到毛主席的身边去，我每一分钟每一秒钟都更接近我们祖国的心脏——北京，接近我们的毛主席，我那能不高兴，不激动呢！
    我走到天安门前，朝着毛主席慈爱的像，深深的鞠了一躬。我好像真的看见毛主席站在上面，像国庆节日向游行群众招手一样的向我招手，是的，毛主席，您永远是向着我们的，天安门前走路的人们，都对我看，好像都在跟我说：“对呀！我们也是像你一样的，我们也像你一样地衷心感谢我们的父亲——毛泽东。”
    我是一个知识分子，在三十年前，我和一个医生结了婚。起初的日子，好像一切都很好，可是后来就不行了。蒋介石的卖国政策，使我们的日子一天比一天难过，我们在银行里的存款，一天比一天少，我们的生活，也一天比一天下降。那时，我也不知道这是蒋介石使我们的日子难过。后来，抗战的炮声响了，它曾使我们兴奋过，我们把所有外币、所有的银器，甚至我小女孩吃饭用的心爱的小银匙，都捐了出来，可是不久，这些都进了官僚资本家的私囊，蒋介石使我们作了一次傻瓜，也打击了我们的爱国热情。
    抗战后，日子更艰难了。我们在银行还有一笔不小的存款，这是给孩子们准备着的教育费、结婚费，我的丈夫凭着他的民族的自尊心和正直的良心，不愿用这些钱去投机囤货，也不愿意把它去换伪币，一直放在银行里不动，他那时还幻想，等抗战胜利后，国家是不会使他吃亏的。但是到抗战胜利后，这一笔钱，只成了我们一个月的手纸费。
    日子是难过了，假使我现在去回想这些日子，真是不堪得很。我们对于生活的担忧倒还是次要的事，做父母亲的，特别是对孩子们前途的关心。孩子们慢慢长大了，但在美帝国主义腐朽思想所笼罩的上海，我们对孩子们的教育，是多么困苦。每一个母亲都会了解我的心的，我们对孩子们的心，对孩子们的关切都是一样的，我们真是呕心断肠，望眼欲穿的期望着孩子们成长，做一个有用的人，可是，在那环境里，一切事情多么使我们痛心呀！
    孩子们在学校里，好像没人管的。我们那时错误的认为教会学校是最好的学校，所以把孩子送到那里去请他们教育，可是，孩子们变了，在学校里，他们学会了享乐。为了裤子补过，我的大孩子就哭着不肯穿着去上学；为了没新皮鞋，我的二孩子几天不肯说话；为了要做大衣，我的大女孩不肯吃饭。孩子们为了要吃好点心，常常的闹。孩子们还学会了骂人，学会了欺骗。我总不能忘记，有一次我的二孩子，在学校里用一种欺骗的方法，获得了一次额外的假期，当我们发觉后，问他，他说是从外国神甫的故事里学来的，效法它的人，在同学中便认为是英雄，他因为要做一个英雄，所以才学会了欺骗。当时，我丈夫难过得饭也吃不下，晚上对我说：“我第一次丧失信心，在孩子身上丧失信心，我为他们的前途担忧！”但坏的还在后面呢！
    在抗战的末期，我们的生活真是不行了，一个医生的收入，无法养活家中那末多人，我们吃山芋、吃杂粮，把车夫辞退了，娘姨从三个降到两个，又降到一个，终于一个没有了。八个孩子和我丈夫所有的家务，都由我负担，我从那时起，就整整几年没有空看报、看书，整日忙着家务。而忙家务，还仅仅疲劳我的身体，孩子们的堕落，却痛苦着我的心灵。更大的伤心事终于发生了，有一天，我的二孩子忽然不愿去上学了，他说：他要去学做买卖，赚钱，你看，他是完全受资产阶级腐朽思想腐蚀了呀！当他第一次提出这事的时候，正在缝衣服的我，惊讶得把针刺进了手指里也不知痛。他父亲手里拿着报在颤抖，我们劝他，骂他，甚至打他。每
    一个母亲都体验过，打孩子是一件多么痛苦的事，但没有用，他举出无数的例子，说明他是对的。他说：我们周围好多有学问、有品德的人，都在挨穷饿肚，而好多不学无术为人很坏的人，却因做买卖而发了财。我们拿什么话去回答他呢？
    抗战胜利了，我们满想我们的日子从此会变好些，但不久我们明白，现实是更坏了。孩子们是愈变愈坏了，我的大孩子，也是个聪明的孩子，胜利时，在圣约翰大学上学，我真也闹不明白，怎样在学校里的学生，在美帝国主义腐朽文化的腐蚀下，竟会一面上学，一面做起生意来了。他赚了钱，就乱花乱用。我们对他规劝，他只当耳边风，一点不听。一个母亲所特有的对孩子的敏感；我发觉他瘦了。他讲话也不像以前那样纯朴、坦白了，他变得虚伪庸俗了，作一个母亲的我，真难过呀！
    后来，我的二孩子倒有了一些转变，原来他认识了一个共产党员，聪明、果敢的他，立即接受了这个光荣的共产党员给予他的教育，他开始变好了。我永远要怀着感谢的心情，来回忆这个谦逊而诚实的共产党员。不久，我的二孩子不再做生意，重新又回到大学里去学习。到一九四七年年初，他终于到解放区去了。他投向了我们的太阳，我们的恩人毛主席的地方去了。
    可是，其他的孩子，在万恶不赦的社会环境下，都变得更坏了。三孩子整天哼着难听的轻浮的歌曲，还穿着小裤脚管的裤子，带着美军的银牌，也学会了抽烟、跳舞。唉，他还不到二十岁呢！我的大女孩，在一个教会女中上学，整天闹着要买这、要买那，闹得我真痛苦，她也跟同学学会了跑跳舞场，皮鞋没穿几次，就嫌式样过时，要重买，衣服也要常常变花样。一切的一切，都是从美国杂志和美国电影里去学来的。据说，她在同学中还算是较老实的一个呢！那时我常常睡不着觉，一闭上眼，孩子们的影子，他们在逐渐堕落下去的影子，就显现在我眼前。他们的前途会怎样呢？我愈想愈痛苦，我的丈夫常常对我说，“不赌钱，不跳舞，我是一个正直的人，但我们的孩子却那样……！”我们都愈来愈苍老了。我常常想起鲁迅先生的“救救孩子”这句话，我也要大声的喊：“救救我的孩子呀！”
    幸亏，好了！上海解放了，新中国诞生了，太阳升起来了——毛主席来了。我们的生活起了变化——一个无法形容的巨变呀！我的二孩子穿了灰军装，精神健壮的回来了，和毛主席的队伍一起胜利的回来了。他给我带来了无数的书，无数的真理，无数的毛主席的话；他把三孩子和大女孩带到了北京去，到毛主席的地方去学习。一九五○年初，三孩子、大女孩都参加了光荣的人民解放军，还参加了新民主主义青年团。他们在毛主席的教导下，认识了真理，服从了真理，为真理而奋斗了。他们把我寄去的钱，退回来，他们说在外面生活很好，不要钱用；把我寄去的东西，退回来，他们说革命的军队要有坚苦朴实的作风，不需要寄东西去；他们把我寄去的不适合的温情，也退了回来。他们和过去完全换了一个人了。
    解放后，生活也一天好一天，我再不要愁物价的波动了。大孩子在毛泽东思想的感召下，毅然的离开上海，到最需要他的东北去了。他寄来的照片，人也一天比一天胖，来信上的话也愈来愈纯朴、亲切，他又变成我的亲爱的大孩子了。
    我的五孩子在初中毕业后，响应了学校号召，到东北邮电学校去学习了。我当时还有一种自私的心，我舍不得他离开我，我打电报、写信去要他回来，他回信来了，上面写着几个大字说：“祖国需要，人民需要，组织需要，妈妈你明白吗？”看了这几个字，我的自私心打消了，我喜欢得眼泪也掉了下来，我重复的一再的读这几个字，我多高兴呀！我想：他才十四岁呀，除了共产党，除了毛主席，谁还能使他变成这样坚强呢？
    我的二女孩，三女孩都在上小学，在新民主主义教育的教导下，她们都变成了光荣的少年儿童队员。看见了她们的红领巾，我心里有说不出的快活。我放心了，她们的前途，我用不着再去担忧了！
    毛主席给我家带来了阳光和春天，我的家庭现在很有生气，晚上，我们有说有笑，无忧无虑，晚上睡下去就睡着了。一切用不着我再担忧了，我们有毛主席，我们有共产党。我又年轻起来，脸上有了血色，白头发也减少了。我的小女孩晚上常常摸我的脸说：“妈妈，你现在常常笑了，我好久好久没有看见你不高兴了。”
    每当我想起我们的幸福生活，我总感激着毛主席。我一心想着，为所有的孩子，为所有的母亲，我应该怎样来感激他呢？孩子们知道我的意思，我的淘气的五孩子给我想了一个好办法，他说：“你们到北京去，到毛主席的地方去吧，去看看天安门，看看天安门上毛主席的像吧。”于是在今年年初，我和我丈夫就来了、到北京，到毛主席住着的地方来了。
    现在在天安门前，毛主席，我望着你站过的地方，望着你的像，我深深的一鞠躬。我要说：“敬爱的毛主席，我们的救星，我们的父亲，我用母亲名义，向你感谢，我衷心的感谢你，毛主席，无穷量的感谢你！”
