    什么叫做基本建设
    问：什么叫做“基本建设”？
    答：“基本建设”一词是从苏联翻译过来的。根据我国目前情况来说，凡是一个企业单位，握有价值在人民币一百万元以上，效用期间在一年以上的资产，都叫做固定资产。凡固定资产的扩大再生产（例如，新企业的建设，旧企业的扩充、改建和恢复等）以及和这相连的工作（例如，为了建设而进行的调查、勘测、设计和科学研究等工作）就叫做基本建设。
    问：“基本建设”包括那些内容？
    答：“基本建设”包括下列三种内容：
    （一）建筑安装工程。像房屋和工矿、交通、农田、水利等方面的建筑物的新建、改建和恢复工程，以及生产、动力、运输、医疗实验等设备的安置装配工程。
    （二）机器设备。像机械设备和属于固定资产性质的各种器具、工具、仪器的购置。
    （三）其他基本建设工作。像为建设而进行的勘测、设计、研究等工作，多年生作物和林木的栽植工作，以及购置土地、房屋等工作。
