    Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, 26th: The US Democratic National Convention, which began on July 21st, is still proceeding in chaos.
    The extreme right wing of the Democratic Party—the Southern faction that advocates racial supremacy—is preparing to secede from the Democratic Party if the presidential candidate elected at the convention and the platform adopted are not satisfactory to them. This intention poses a serious threat to the Democratic Party bosses. They decided to make concessions to the Southern faction, and as a result, the convention passed two resolutions on the morning of the 23rd to appease the Southern faction. The first resolution concerned the dispute over credentials between two opposing delegations from Texas and Mississippi. Under pressure from the party bosses, the convention approved the attendance of the Southern faction's delegations from these two states. The second resolution was an amendment to the rules of procedure passed by the convention the previous day. The original rule stipulated that representatives would not be allowed to attend the convention unless they signed a so-called "loyalty oath" guaranteeing that they would do their utmost to ensure that the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates elected by the convention appeared on the ballots in their respective states. The revised rule completely invalidated the guarantees made by the representatives.
    Under these circumstances, all the Southern faction's representatives, except for the South Carolina delegation led by former Secretary of State Byrnes, the Virginia delegation led by Senator Byrd, and part of the Louisiana delegation, signed this meaningless "loyalty oath".
    At the afternoon session on July 23rd, Chairman Day declared that they could not participate in voting on the issues discussed at the convention before they signed the "loyalty oath". Senator Byrd made it clear in a radio address that he was waiting for the convention to kick his delegation out and implied that he welcomed such action, believing that from his point of view, it would be better than his delegation withdrawing from the convention voluntarily. But the leaders of the convention did not do so, and the fact is that the South Carolina and Virginia delegations continued to attend the convention, although without legitimate voting rights.
    At the convention on July 24th, nominations for presidential candidates began. The main candidates nominated were Illinois Governor Stevenson, Mutual Security Agency Director Harriman, Senator Kefauver, Senator Kerr, and Senator Russell. Vice President Barkley, who had been actively campaigning, had announced his withdrawal in disappointment after the convention began. This was because union bureaucrats had openly stated that they were unwilling to support him, and it was said that the 74-year-old vice president was too old.
    As at the Republican convention, each nomination speech was followed by a noisy demonstration, with delegates screaming and whistling. This process was hindered when the question of whether to give voting rights to representatives who had not signed the "loyalty oath" was discussed.
    After Virginia Governor Battle stated in his speech that although the state delegation refused to sign the "loyalty oath," the names of the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates could appear on the Virginia ballot in November, the Maryland delegation considered this to be a sufficient guarantee and formally proposed that the Virginia delegation be given voting rights at this convention. The convention passed this suggestion by a narrow majority, and then the nominations continued.
    By the end of the convention on the 25th, the delegates had held two votes to elect the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates. But no one was able to obtain the 616 votes necessary for nomination. Therefore, the convention will continue in open brawling and behind-the-scenes deals.

    美民主党代表大会一片混乱
    【新华社二十六日讯】芝加哥消息：七月二十一日开始的美国民主党全国代表大会仍在乱哄哄地进行。
    民主党内的极右翼——主张种族优越主义的南方派，准备在大会选出的总统候选人与通过的政纲不能使他们满意时，就从民主党分裂出去。这种意图对民主党的老板们造成了严重的威胁。他们决定向南方派让步，因而使大会在二十三日上午通过了两个讨好南方派的决议。第一个决议是关于得克萨斯州与密士失必州各有两个对立的代表团争夺出席权问题的。大会在党老板的压力下，通过这两个州南方派的代表团出席。第二个决议是对于大会前一日通过的会议规则的修正案。原来的规则规定：代表们除非在所谓“忠诚誓言”上签字保证他们将竭尽所能使大会所选出的总统与副总统候选人的名字出现在他们各自州内的选票上，就不能获准出席大会。修改后的规则使代表们所作的保证完全失去意义。
    在这种情况下，除了南卡罗来纳州州长前国务卿贝尔纳斯率领的南卡罗来纳州代表团、参议员比尔德率领的弗吉尼亚州代表团以及路易斯安那州一部分的代表以外，所有南方派的代表都在这个没有意义的“忠诚誓言”上签了字。
    在七月二十三日下午会议上，主席戴维尔裁决，在他们签立“忠诚誓言”之前，不得对代表大会所讨论的问题参加表决。参议员比尔德在电台发表谈话时明白表示，他在等候代表大会把他的代表团撵出去，并暗示说，他欢迎这种行动，他认为从他的观点来看，这比他的代表团自动退出大会要好。但是大会的领袖们没有这么做，而且事实是，南卡罗来纳州和弗吉尼亚州的代表团也仍继续出席大会，不过没有合法的发言权。
    在七月二十四日的大会上开始了对总统候选人的提名。被提名的主要候选人有伊利诺斯州州长史蒂文森，共同安全署署长哈里曼，参议员克福维尔，参议员凯尔和参议员鲁塞尔。原来曾积极参加竞选的副总统巴克莱，在大会开始后就已悻悻地宣布退出。因为，工会官僚们已公开表示他们不愿支持他，据说这位七十四岁的副总统年纪已太大了。
    和共和党大会上一样，每一次提名演说后，接着就是一阵吵吵嚷嚷的示威，代表们发出尖声怪叫，并且大吹口哨。这种进程在讨论到是否把表决权给予没有在“忠诚保证”上签字的代表这个问题时，受到了阻挠。
    在弗吉尼亚州州长白特尔在其演说中表示了虽然该州代表团拒绝在“忠诚保证”上签字，民主党总统和副总统候选人的名字十一月间可以在弗吉尼亚州选票上出现之后，马里兰州代表团认为这已构成了充分的保证，正式提议应给弗吉尼亚州代表团在这次代表大会上的表决权。代表大会以微弱的多数通过了这个建议，然后，提名才继续进行下去。
    到二十五日大会结束时为止，代表们已举行了两次投票，选举民主党总统与副总统的候选人。但是没有一个人能得到为提名所必需的六百十六票。因此大会将继续在公开的吵闹与暗地的交易中进行下去。
