    The Korean War Cannot Save the Economic Crisis in the United States
    Two years ago, when signs of a new crisis of overproduction in the American capitalist economy became increasingly apparent, the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, then partially mobilized at home and declared a state of emergency, further pushing the national economy onto a war footing, attempting to escape the maturing economic crisis in this way. Two years later, there are many signs that the stimulating effect of the war has gradually disappeared, and the ever-expanding war production proves that it cannot offset the impact of reduced social purchasing power caused by the widespread impoverishment of the working people.
    After the outbreak of the Korean War, under the stimulation of huge government military orders and panic buying in society, American industrial production and sales volume once achieved an abnormal increase. The American capitalist propaganda machine then widely spread the myth of unlimited prosperity. However, in less than a year, the war economy began to expose its inherent weaknesses, and sales began to decline and have not improved since. Despite huge military orders, total industrial production did not even recover to the peak of World War II, and turned downward in the summer of last year. Since then, there has been a clear state of stagnation. In the American bourgeois press, the tone of anxiety about another economic storm has replaced the initial triumphant clamor.
    For two years, the American economy has embarked on the road of war production. The industrial sectors related to war production have continued to expand under the stimulus of huge government military orders. According to American officials, the proportion of so-called "defense" production in the total American production has increased to nearly three times, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the total production; the number of workers it employs has increased threefold, reaching a huge figure of six million; in addition, many companies rely on military production for their activities. This is how American capitalism supports its so-called "prosperity" and "full employment."
    However, the increase in military orders cannot make up for the reduction in the civilian market, and the gap between the expanding level of war production and the declining level of civilian production is growing. Although American industrial production once rose to the highest peak after the war, it actually stagnated throughout 1951. The level of production in January of this year was the same as in January of last year. Since the beginning of this year, production has continued to be in an obviously unstable state. After a slight rebound in February, it fell back to the January level in March, and then fell by nearly 3% in April and May. Compared with May of last year, it decreased by more than 4%. The reduction in production is due to a large reduction in civilian industrial production. For example, passenger car production decreased by nearly half compared to a year ago, major appliances decreased by nearly one-third, furniture decreased by about one-tenth, and other products such as textiles, paper products, and processed foods also decreased. A particularly significant phenomenon is that in the production sectors of food, clothing, leather, and other so-called "soft goods," even the supporting effect of military orders is diminishing.
    The stagnation of the American economy is ultimately the result of a reduction in social purchasing power. The wages of the working people have been frozen, while the cost of living continues to rise; welfare subsidies have been cut, while taxes have increased significantly. Most of their labor income has flowed into the pockets of monopoly capitalists. Since the Korean War, American company profits have been no less than 90 billion U.S. dollars, close to the total amount for the five years of World War II. All of this has come at the cost of lowering the living standards of the working people. Since the war economy increasingly deprives the working people of their means of livelihood and income, transforming them into profits, it cannot but shrink social purchasing power, thereby making goods unsalable. The "panic buying" phenomenon that occurred at the beginning of the Korean War was originally a hoarding activity under the stimulus of the war, and had nothing to do with the vast majority of working people whose income was only enough to make ends meet. Now, warehouses from manufacturers to retailers are filled with unsold inventory. Regarding this phenomenon, the American big capitalist publication "U.S. News & World Report" expressed concern and said: "Business is complaining that everything is in full supply, except consumers."
    In this case, many capitalists have had to attract customers with big price cuts. The regulations restricting installment purchases after the start of the Korean War have been cancelled, and capitalists have even set conditions lower than before. But all this still cannot change the sluggish market situation. Sales of civilian goods are still declining. According to the May 16th issue of "U.S. News & World Report," automobile sales decreased by 17.6% compared to a year ago, furniture and appliances decreased by 15.2%, hardware and building materials decreased by 9.8%, department store sales decreased by 4.1%, clothing decreased by 2.1%, and other durable goods decreased by 2.4%.
    The shrinking market not only affects the sales of general consumer goods, but also affects the means of production. The extremely inflated production has begun to exceed the extent that the war economy can digest in many aspects. For example, according to the "Wall Street Journal," "Steel leaders are already openly worrying about sales problems, and even talking about dismantling some factories. Aluminum manufacturers are searching for customers. Not long ago, they launched a dumping campaign in Washington."
    The sharp increase in war expenditures and the blind expansion of war production have put such heavy pressure on the entire American economy that even the more sensible representatives of big capitalists have refuted the lie that the American economic power is infinitely strong, and warned people to pay attention to the danger of its sudden collapse. For example, Republican presidential candidate Taft once said: "The president is now asking to spend 85 billion U.S. dollars in the year starting July 1st and in the next year. That will take 30% of the people's income, and state and local governments will take another 7%. Many economists feel that if the government takes more than 25% of the people's income, we will not be able to prevent inflation or maintain a free economy at all." However, this view did not lead to a truly sober conclusion. The corrupt American capitalism is still clinging to the war economy as its life-saving circle. It is trying to find and create new war stimuli, but at the same time considering slowing down the speed of war production to缓和the pressure of the crisis. According to this policy, the Truman administration has extended its arms expansion plan to 1955, and correspondingly relaxed controls on several basic raw materials. But on the basis of the extremely developed capitalist contradictions in the United States, this can only cause the development of a crisis of further stimulating overproduction. Representatives of some companies are again demanding an increase in the intensity of the arms race. This situation reflects a fundamental fact: The two years of the Korean War have definitely proved that the war economy cannot find a way out for the dying capitalism of the United States.
    Faced with this irresistible trend, even those who have always regarded huge military expenditures as a panacea for curing economic crises now admit that the war economic policy cannot save the fate of American capitalism. The American big business magazine "Business Week" said in fear when mentioning the instability of the American economic future: "Under normal conditions, the United States would now be heading towards a depression, and military spending only temporarily postpones the day of reckoning."

### 朝鲜战争挽救不了美国的经济危机

    朝鲜战争挽救不了美国的经济危机
    两年以前，当美国资本主义经济中新的生产过剩的危机日益显露迹象时，美帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，接着就在国内局部进行动员并且宣布了紧急状态，把全国经济进一步推上战争的轨道，企图用这样的办法来逃脱成熟中的经济危机。两年以后，已有许多迹象说明，战争的刺激作用已逐渐消失，而不断扩大的战争生产也证明并不能抵销由于劳动人民普遍贫穷化而造成的社会购买力缩小的影响。
    朝鲜战争爆发后，在政府巨额军事订货和社会上抢购物资的刺激下，美国的工业生产和货物销售量曾经获得了畸形的增加。美国资本家的宣传机器那时曾经大事散布关于无限繁荣的神话。但是，为时不到一年，战争经济就开始暴露出它固有的弱点，销售量开始下降了，而且一直没有起色。尽管有庞大的军事订货，整个工业生产还来不及回复到第二次大战时的高峰，就在去年夏天转入下跌，从那时以后，出现着一种明显的停滞状态。在美国资产阶级的报刊里，关于另一次经济风暴的忧虑的语调已代替了当初得意忘形的喧嚷。
    两年以来，美国经济走上了战争生产的道路，与战争生产有关的工业部门，在政府巨额军事订货的刺激下，生产不断扩大。据美国官方人士透露，所谓“国防”生产在美国总生产中所占的比重已增加到了将近三倍，占总生产的近六分之一；它所雇用的工人的数目增加到了三倍，达到六百万的庞大数字；在这以外，还有许多企业依靠着军事生产而活动。美国资本主义就是这样来支撑它的所谓“繁荣”和“充分就业”的。
    但是军事订货的增加来不及顶补民用市场的缩减，而扩大中的战争生产水平和下降中的民用生产水平之间的差额却越来越大。美国工业生产尽管有一度上升到战后最高峰，但是在一九五一年全年内实际上是停滞不进。今年一月时生产的水平和去年一月一样。今年以来，生产继续处于显然不稳的状态。在二月份略微回升之后，三月份又降到一月水平，而四、五两月又连续下跌将近百分之三，如果与去年五月相较，就减少了百分之四以上。生产的减少是由于民用工业生产的大量缩减。例如客车生产较一年前减少了将近一半，主要用具减少了将近三分之一，家具减少了约十分之一，其他如纺织品、纸制品、制成食品等也都减少了。特别有意义的现象是：在食物、被服、皮革及其他所谓“软货”生产部门中，甚至军事订货的支持作用也在减退之中。
    美国经济的停滞现象，归根结底，是社会购买力减少的结果。劳动人民的工资被冻结了，而生活费却不断上涨；福利事业补助削减了，而捐税却大量增加。他们的劳动所得绝大部分都流进了垄断资本家的腰包。自从朝鲜战争以来，美国的公司利润不下于九百亿美元，接近于第二次大战时期五年的总数。这都是以降低劳动人民的生活水平为其代价而得来的。战争经济既然愈来愈大量地剥夺劳动人民的生活手段和收入，转化为利润，它就不能不使社会购买力萎缩，从而使货物滞销。朝鲜战争初期发生过的“抢购”现象，本来已是在战争刺激下的囤积活动，和最广大的收入仅够糊口的劳动人民并无关系。而现在，从制造商到零售商的仓库中已经都堆满了卖不出去的存货。关于这个现象，美国大资本家的出版物“美国新闻与世界报导”杂志曾表示忧虑说：“商业在抱怨，任何东西都有充分供应，就是没有消费者。”
    在这种情况下，许多资本家不得不以大减价来招徕顾客。朝鲜战争开始后限制分期付款购货办法的条例取消了，资本家甚至把条件定得比以前还低。但是这一切也仍旧改变不了市场的不景气情况。民用物品的销售量仍在减低。据五月十六日“美国新闻与世界报导”杂志材料，汽车销售量较一年以前下降了百分之十七·六，家具及用具减少了百分之十五·二，五金及建筑材料减少了百分之九·八，百货商店的销售量减少了百分之四·一，衣服减少了百分之二·一，其他耐用品减少了百分之二·四。
    市场的萎缩不但影响到一般消费品的销路，而且也影响到生产资料。极度膨胀的生产已开始在许多方面超过战争经济所能消化的程度。例如：据“华尔街杂志”承认，“钢铁领袖们已在公开忧虑销路问题，甚至在谈论要拆卸若干工厂的问题。铝制造商们在搜寻顾主，不久之前，他们还在华盛顿发动了一个倾销运动。”
    战争开支的急剧增加以及战争生产的盲目膨胀，已经对于整个美国经济造成如此沉重的压力，以至比较神智清醒的大资本家的代表都驳斥了关于美国经济力量无限雄厚的谎话，而警告人们注意它可能突然崩溃的危险。例如共和党总统候选人塔夫脱就曾说过：“总统现在要求在七月一日开始的年度中以及在再下一年度中，花费八百五十亿美元。那将拿走人民收入的百分之三十，此外州政府和地方政府还要拿走百分之七。许多经济学家觉得，如果政府拿走人民收入超过百分之二十五的话，我们就根本不能防止通货膨胀或是保持一种自由经济。”但是这种见解却并没有引出真正清醒的结论，美国的腐朽的资本主义仍然死抱着战争经济作为它的救命圈，它竭力设法寻找和制造新的战争刺激，但同时又考虑要减缓战争生产的速度来缓和危机的压力。根据这种方针，杜鲁门政府已把它的军备扩张计划延展到一九五五年，并且相应放宽了对于几种基本原料的管制。但是在美国的极度发展的资本主义根本矛盾的基础上，这只能引起进一步刺激生产过剩的危机的发展的问题。某些企业的代表又在要求再增加军备运动的强度了。这种情形反映了一个根本的事实，就是：朝鲜战争的两年已经确定地证明了，战争经济决不能为美国垂死的资本主义找到出路。
    面对这种无可抗拒的趋势，连一向把巨额的军备开支看作医治经济危机的万应灵药的人们，现在也承认，战争经济政策也并不能挽救美国资本主义的命运。美国大商业的杂志“商业周刊”在恐惧地提到美国经济前途的不稳定时说：“在平常的条件下，现在美国就将迎头走向萧条，而军事费用只不过把清算的日子暂时推后而已。”    （新华社）
