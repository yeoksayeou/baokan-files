    The Children of Xuchang City No. 1 Primary School Actively Participate in Supporting the Military
    Editor: Our Xuchang City No. 1 Primary School in Henan Province has more than 600 Young Pioneers. Last year, after the "June 1st" call of the China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association was issued, the Young Pioneers actively participated in supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs. They organized a total of fourteen comfort groups, which took turns going out twice a week to comfort the families of martyrs and military personnel, and have never stopped since. Under the influence of the Young Pioneers, all the students in the school participated in supporting the military. Just take June 13th of this year as an example, the entire school sent out fourteen comfort groups, which went to fourteen streets to carry 550 loads of water for the families of martyrs and military personnel, swept 71 courtyards clean, and visited 105 families of martyrs and military personnel. Whenever the Young Pioneers and students went to the home of a martyr's family or a military family, they enthusiastically helped with the work. The older ones carried water, and the younger ones swept the floor. When the families of martyrs and military personnel saw the children coming, they were as affectionate as if they were their own children, moving stools for the children to sit on, pouring water to drink, grabbing the brooms to prevent them from sweeping, and preventing them from carrying water, saying:
    "Children, just sit down and talk, and we are happy enough." Military dependent Granny Liu said: "I have two more children, and I will still call them to join the army when they grow up. Our military families are so glorious! The People's Government takes care of us, and the students come to comfort us. I will write a letter to my child in Korea and tell him to kill a few more American devils to repay Chairman Mao." In the year or so of supporting the military, the children have established a strong emotional bond with the families of martyrs and military personnel. Military dependent Old Lady Wang, whose two children have joined the army, is an example. The students often go to her home to comfort her, help her read and write letters, carry water, and so on. Once when the students went to her home, Old Lady Wang had already stewed a pot of meat. After the students finished their work, she locked the door and said to the students kindly: "Children, you have come to comfort me for a year, it's my turn to comfort you, you all have to eat a bowl of meat before leaving." The children didn't want to eat. She said:
    "The children don't love me, don't ever come to my house again." Everyone had to eat the meat. That day, Old Lady Wang was busy for half the night, and she couldn't stop smiling. In the work of providing comfort, the students also paid attention to helping the government understand the difficulties of the families of martyrs and military personnel. Military dependent Zhong San, who was blind in both eyes, urgently needed relief. After the students learned about this, they reported it to the Xuchang Municipal People's Government, and Zhong San's problem was quickly resolved. At the same time, the students also received a letter of commendation from the Xuchang Municipal People's Government.

    许昌市立第一小学的孩子们积极参加优抚工作
    编辑同志：我们河南省许昌市立第一小学校有六百多个少年儿童队员。去年，抗美援朝总会的“六一”号召发出后，少年儿童队员们便积极地参加了优抚工作。共组织了十四个慰问组，每周轮流出动两次，慰问烈属、军属，直到现在从未间断过。在少年儿童队员们的影响下，校中的同学，都参加了优抚工作。就说今年六月十三日这一天吧，全校出动了十四个慰问组，分别到十四条街道替烈属、军属担了五百五十担水，扫干净了七十一个院子，慰问了一百零五家烈属、军属。队员们、同学们每到一家烈属或军属家里，就热情地给烈属、军属干活，年龄大的担水，小的扫地。烈属、军属们看见孩子们来了，亲热得像对自己的孩子一样，给孩子们搬凳子坐，倒水喝，夺着条帚不让扫地，也不让担水，说道：
    “孩子们坐下谈谈，我们就够喜欢了。”军属刘大娘说：“我还有两个孩子，长大了还叫他们参军。我们军属多光荣啊！人民政府照顾了，学生们又来慰问。我要给在朝鲜的孩子写信，叫他多打死几个美国鬼子，好报答毛主席。”在一年多来的优抚工作中，孩子们和烈属、军属建立了浓厚的情感。一位军属汪老太太，她的两个孩子都参军了。同学们经常去她家慰问，替她看信，写信，挑水，等等。有一次同学们去的时候，汪老太太就先炖了一锅肉。当同学们干完活后，她把门锁起来，慈祥地对同学们说：“孩子们，你们来慰问我一年了，该我慰问你们一次啦，都得吃碗肉再走。”孩子们不吃。她说：
    “孩子们不爱我，以后永不要来我家啦。”大家只好吃了肉。那天，汪老太太忙了半晚上，她一直合不住嘴地笑。同学们在做慰问工作中，还注意帮助政府了解烈属、军属的困难情形。一位双目失明的军属钟三急需救济，同学们知道后反映给许昌市人民政府，使钟三的问题很快便解决了。同时，同学们也接到了许昌市人民政府的表扬信。
