To the gentlemen of the national industrial and commercial circles:

    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has been established on June 30. This is a national organization of our industrial and commercial circles and the beginning of the great unity of the national industrial and commercial circles. Before the establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Preparatory Committee will exercise its functions and powers on its behalf. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce shoulders a major responsibility. It will lead our national industrialists and businessmen to abide by the Common Program, promote the policies and decrees of the People's Government, and guide our private industry and commerce to develop production and improve management under the overall national economic plan; at the same time, it will represent the legitimate interests of our industrialists and businessmen, reflect opinions and suggestions to the People's Government and relevant authorities, and organize industrialists and businessmen to study, transform their thinking, and participate in various patriotic movements.

    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is a very solemn matter. After seven months of preparation, we started to convene the Representative Conference of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on June 20. There were 413 representatives from all provinces and cities across the country, as well as Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan. Among them were 76 representatives from state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, 18 specially invited representatives, and 319 representatives from private industry and commerce, including representatives of large, medium, and small cities and large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises, handicraftsmen, stallholders, and capitalist agents, as well as representatives of ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong and Macao. It also included people from the central and local governments related to industry and commerce, making the conference widely representative. After eleven days of enthusiastic discussion and repeated consultation by the participating representatives, 160 preparatory committee members were democratically elected, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was established.

    The convocation of this National Congress of Industrial and Commercial Federation Preparatory Representatives, in addition to the establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, making the national industrial and commercial circles have their own national organization, the conference itself has great educational significance for the national industrial and commercial circles. Because this conference was convened after the victorious conclusion of the "Five-Anti" Movement. During the "Five-Anti" Movement, the filth and poison left over from the old society in our industrial and commercial circles were thoroughly exposed, and the "five poisons" behavior was strictly cleansed. After this movement, our industrial and commercial circles have been further transformed ideologically. However, among our industrialists and businessmen, some, although having gone through the great "Five-Anti" Movement, still have some doubts and worries about the industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government and the production and operation of enterprises. This time, after eleven days of meetings, especially after listening to the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council and Director Chen Yun of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, the doubts and worries of the participating representatives have been dispelled, and the confidence and enthusiasm for production and operation have been greatly improved. We have clearly realized that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government over the past three years, the restoration and transformation of our people's economy has been successfully completed, and national construction has achieved great development. For private industry and commerce, the People's Government has always adopted the policy of "encouraging its enthusiasm for operation and assisting its development" as long as it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, over the past three years, industrial and commercial households in large, medium, and small cities across the country have increased significantly, and except for a very few industries that are not suitable for the needs of the people, they all present a thriving scene. In the future, in the country's large-scale economic construction, legitimate industry and commerce will be developed even more greatly and soundly.

    Through repeated discussions in the general meeting and group meetings, our participating representatives have more clearly realized that the "Five-Anti" Movement launched by the Central People's Government has extremely great significance for our national construction and the ideological transformation of our industrial and commercial circles. In the past three years of national construction, our industrialists and businessmen have made considerable contributions. They have played a certain role in restoring production and urban-rural exchanges, internal and external exchanges, etc.; they have also donated airplanes and artillery in support of the great Resist-US, Aid-Korea Movement, which is a positive aspect. However, the "five poisons" crimes exposed in the "Five-Anti" Movement are extremely harmful to the country and the people, which is a negative and decadent aspect. After the "Five-Anti" Movement, a great social reform movement that learns from past mistakes to avoid future ones and cures diseases to save people, and after clearing away the "five poisons," private industry and commerce can develop healthily and play a greater positive role for the country and the people. After self-examination and discussions at the meeting, the participating representatives realized that from now on, our industrialists and businessmen must honestly abide by the Common Program, obey the leadership of the working class, the state-owned economy, and the national plan, no longer commit the "five poisons," and actively engage in production. This is not only beneficial to the people of the whole country, but also extremely beneficial to our industrialists and businessmen themselves.

    After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, some difficulties have emerged in private industry and commerce in the process of social and economic restructuring. The participating representatives also brought the wishes and requirements of the industrial and commercial circles, hoping to be resolved through this meeting. Director Chen Yun's report made clear and principled instructions on some major issues of concern to our industrial and commercial circles.

    Director Chen Yun pointed out that after the end of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, "it is necessary to adjust the relationship between public and private, and labor-capital relations on a new basis." For how to protect the legitimate profits of private industry and commerce after eliminating the "five poisons," stipulate the specifications for processing and ordering goods, smooth urban and rural internal and external exchanges, lower bank interest rates, correct the phenomenon of excessive light or heavy burdens in taxation, and adjust labor-capital relations in accordance with the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, clear principles for solutions have been proposed based on the actual situation. After the closing of the conference, the relevant competent departments of the Central People's Government convened symposiums on urban-rural exchanges, symposiums on the study of tax issues, and symposiums on reemployment issues, where responsible leaders personally listened to the specific opinions of representatives from all parties and were responsible for answering various existing problems. Before and after the meeting, the processing fees for spun cotton yarn were increased, bank deposit and loan interest rates were reduced, and the scope of processing and ordering goods was expanded and processing fees were adjusted in various places. Therefore, the participating representatives further realized that the "Five-Anti" Movement was to clear obstacles for national construction and also to pave the way for the development of legitimate private industry and commerce under the overall plan of national economic construction. After eleven days of meetings, the political awareness and business confidence of the attending representatives have been significantly improved. Finally, everyone unanimously made four resolutions as the direction for future efforts:

    First, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and under the overall national economic plan, give play to the enthusiasm for production and operation.

    Second, in accordance with the Notice on Study Issues of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, study the Common Program and the policies and decrees of the People's Government in a planned and organized manner, and frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism in order to combine study with business and consistency of words and deeds, and resolutely oppose and eliminate the "five poisons."

    Third, promote and assist the reorganization of industrial and commercial federations and trade associations in various places, and unite and help each other among large, medium, and small industrial and commercial households, so that each can get what they need; in some areas, it is also necessary to take care of the interests of ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese industrial and commercial circles.

    Fourth, vigorously increase production and practice economy, continue to strengthen the work of resisting the US and aiding Korea, and actively participate in various patriotic movements.

    Now the Representative Conference of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has been successfully closed, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has also been established. The representatives and members from various places will soon return to their respective work posts. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will distribute the documents and resolutions of the conference and the prepared transmission outline to the industrial and commercial federations or preparatory committees of various cities, counties, and towns across the country. I hope that the industrial and commercial federations or preparatory committees of various cities, counties, and towns will actively assist the representatives and members who have returned to their respective places, and immediately convey the spirit and decisions of the conference to all industrialists and businessmen according to the transmission outline, and launch discussions to ensure that industrialists and businessmen can thoroughly understand the great achievements of this preparatory representative conference and effectively implement the spirit and decisions of the conference.

    Gentlemen of the national industrial and commercial circles, this preparatory representative conference has dispelled the ideological concerns of our industrialists and businessmen after the "Five-Anti" Movement and resolved the various problems existing in the business of our industrialists and businessmen. The achievements of this conference are immeasurable. The peak season in autumn is coming, and the country's large-scale construction is about to begin. Looking forward to the bright and splendid future of our great motherland, we should be full of confidence, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and strive for the construction of our great motherland!

    向全国工商业界的讲话
    ——一九五二年七月十日在中央人民广播电台的广播词
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员　陈叔通全国工商业界的先生们：
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，已经在六月三十号成立了，这是我们工商界全国性的组织，是全国工商界大团结的开始。在中华全国工商业联合会还没有建立以前，筹备委员会将要代行它的职权。因此，中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会肩负着重大的责任，它将要领导我们全国工商业者，遵守共同纲领，推行人民政府的政策法令，指导我们私营工商业在国家总的经济计划下发展生产、改善经营；同时也代表我们工商业者的合法利益，向人民政府和有关机关反映意见，提出建议，并且组织工商业者进行学习、改造思想和参加各种爱国运动。
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会的成立，是十分郑重的。我们经过七个月的筹备以后，才在六月二十号开始召开了中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议。到会的有全国各省、市以及内蒙古、西藏和台湾的代表，一共四百一十三人，其中国营企业和合作社的代表七十六人、特邀代表十八人、私营工商业代表三百一十九人，包括了全国大、中、小城市和大、中、小工商企业、手工业者、摊商和资方代理人的代表，以及少数民族和海外侨胞、港澳工商界的代表，也包括了中央和各地区与工商界有关的人士，使会议具有广泛的代表性。经过与会代表十一天热烈的讨论和反复的协商，民主选出了筹备委员一百六十人，成立了中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会。
    这次全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的召开，除为了成立中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，使全国工商界开始有了自己全国性的组织之外，会议本身对全国工商界来讲是有重大的教育意义。因为这次会议，是在“五反”运动胜利结束以后召开的，在“五反”运动当中，我们工商界所存在着的旧社会遗留下来的污毒，被彻底地揭露出来，“五毒”行为受到了一次严格的清洗。经过了这次运动，我们工商界在思想上得到了进一步的改造。可是，在我们工商业者里面，有一部分人虽然经过了伟大的“五反”运动，但是对于人民政府的工商业政策，对于企业的生产和经营，还有某些怀疑和顾虑。这一次经过十一天的会议，特别是听到了政务院周恩来总理和政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任的报告以后，与会代表们的怀疑和顾虑已经打消了，对于生产经营的信心和积极性是大大地提高了。我们已经明确地认识到：三年来在毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，已经胜利地完成了我国人民经济的恢复和改造的工作，国家建设已经获得了伟大发展。对于私营工商业，凡是有利于国计民生的，人民政府一贯采取“鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展”的方针。因此，三年来全国大、中、小城市的工商业户都有显著的增加，除了极少数不适合于人民要求的行业以外，都呈现着欣欣向荣的气象。而在今后国家的大规模经济建设当中，正当的工商业还会得到更大的、更健全的发展。
    经过大会和分组会议的反复讨论，我们与会的代表更明确地认识到：中央人民政府所发动的“五反”运动，对于我们的国家建设，对于我们工商界的思想改造都具有极其伟大的意义。在过去三年来的国家建设当中，我们工商业者是有相当贡献的。在恢复生产和城乡交流、内外交流等方面，都起了一定的作用；在支援伟大的抗美援朝运动当中又捐献了飞机大炮，这方面是积极的。但是在“五反”运动当中所揭发的“五毒”罪行，则是对国家、对人民极端有害的，这就是消极腐朽的一面。经过“五反”运动这一惩前毖后、治病救人的伟大社会改革运动之后，经过了清除“五毒”之后，私营工商业才能够得到健康的发展，才能对国家对人民发挥其更大的积极作用。经过自我检讨和会议上的讨论，与会的代表认识到：今后我们工商业者必须老老实实遵照共同纲领办事，服从工人阶级、国营经济和国家计划的领导，不再犯“五毒”，积极从事生产。这样不但对全国人民有利，对我们工商业者自己也是极其有利的。
    在“三反”、“五反”运动之后，在社会经济的改组过程当中，私营工商业是出现了一些困难的。与会的代表们也带着工商界的愿望和要求，希望经过这一次会议能够得到解决。陈云主任的报告，对于我们工商界所关心的一些重大问题都作了明确的原则指示。
    陈云主任指出：在“三反”、“五反”运动结束以后，“需要在新的基础上来调整公私关系、劳资关系”。对于消除“五毒”以后，如何保障私营工商业的合法利润，规定加工定货的规格，畅通城乡内外交流、降低银行利息、纠正税收负担当中的畸轻畸重的现象，按照发展生产、劳资两利的原则调整劳资关系，都已经根据实际情况，提出了明确的解决原则。大会闭幕以后，中央人民政府的有关的主管部门又召开了城乡交流座谈会、税务问题研究座谈会和转业问题座谈会，由负责首长亲临听取各方面代表的具体意见，并且负责解答了目前存在着的各种问题。在会议进行的前后，代纺棉纱提高了工缴费，银行减低了存放利率，各地加工定货的范围在扩大，工缴费在调整。因此，与会的代表更进一步地认识了：“五反”运动是为国家建设扫除障碍，也是在国家经济建设总的计划之下，为正当的私营工商业铺平发展的道路。经过了十一天会议，出席的代表在政治认识上和经营的信心上，都有了显著的提高。最后大家一致地作出了四项决议，作为今后努力的方向：
    第一、在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，在国家总的经济计划下，发挥生产与经营的积极性。
    第二、根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于学习问题的通知，有计划、有组织地学习共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，经常展开批评和自我批评，以求学习与业务相结合和言行的一致，坚决反对和清除“五毒”。
    第三、推动和协助各地工商业联合会及同业公会的改组，并使大、中、小工商业户团结互助，各得其所；在某些地区，并须照顾少数民族和华侨工商界的利益。
    第四、厉行增产节约，继续加强抗美援朝工作，并积极参加各种爱国运动。
    现在中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议已经圆满闭会，中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会也已经成立，各地的代表、委员即将回到各自的工作岗位。中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会要把大会的文件和决议以及作成的传达提纲分寄全国各市、县、镇工商业联合会或者筹备会。我希望全国各市、县、镇工商业联合会或者筹备会积极协助回到各地的代表、委员，根据传达提纲，立刻向全体工商业者传达大会的精神和决定，展开讨论，务必使工商业者都能彻底了解这次筹备代表会议的伟大成就，并且切实贯彻大会的精神和决定。
    全国工商业界的先生们，这次筹备代表会议解除了我们工商业者“五反”以后思想上存在着的顾虑，解决了我们工商业者业务上存在着的各种问题。这次会议的成就是无可估量的。秋后旺季即将到来，国家的大规模建设也就要开始，瞻望我们伟大祖国光辉灿烂的前途，我们应该满怀信心，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，为我们伟大祖国的建设而奋斗！
