Many units have adopted methods such as selection at each level and focused testing to carefully select athletes for various events. The units directly under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Public Security Forces, military hospitals, and major units such as the Northwest, Northeast, and Central South Military Regions have all held sports games. At the same time, various units have selected representatives for the literary and artistic competitions from among professional art workers and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers.

The military and political leaders at all levels in the troops and the Chinese Communist Party committees have attached great importance to the selection and education of various athletes and representatives. Commander He Long of the Southwest Military Region and Deputy Commander Zhang Zongxun of the Northwest Military Region personally presided over the selection of athletes. When athletes were undergoing centralized training, in addition to technical training, many military and political leaders personally gave lectures to the athletes, calling on everyone to carry forward the fine qualities of the People's Liberation Army's sports activities, and repeatedly conducted education on serving national construction and defense construction through sports activities.

Cadres at all levels and the broad masses of soldiers throughout the army enthusiastically participated in the selection competitions for cultural and sports representatives. Many senior commanders with outstanding battlefield achievements also actively participated in the competition, and some were elected as representatives. Among the athletes of the Military Academy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, there were fifteen division-level cadres. Many famous heroic companies have also been designated as representatives to participate in the all-army cultural tests. Among the representatives in the literary and artistic competitions, many are soldiers who love recreational activities.
