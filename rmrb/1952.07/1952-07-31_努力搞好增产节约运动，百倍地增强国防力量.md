    Strive to Do a Good Job in the Production Increase and Economy Practice Movement to Increase National Defense Strength a Hundredfold

    The "August 1st" Army Day is coming. This year's "August 1st" is the 25th anniversary of the birth of our people's army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gone from victory to victory through more than 20 years of heroic struggle and has now developed into a powerful armed force to defend the security of the motherland and world peace.
    Our people's army, the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, has a glorious history: During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, it crushed the five encirclements and suppressions by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and heroically defended the interests of the revolutionary people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it resisted 95 percent of the puppet troops and 64 percent of the Japanese invaders, and finally defeated Japanese imperialism with the cooperation of the Soviet Red Army. During the War of Liberation of the Motherland, it wiped out more than 8 million Kuomintang bandit troops armed by the American robbers and liberated all of mainland China. Now, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is protecting the safety of all Chinese people and defending the motherland. Another army of our people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—fought side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front to help our neighbor, the Korean people, resist the American imperialist aggression, severely hit the American robbers, disrupted the American imperialist plan to invade China, Asia, and the world, and defended the security of the motherland and world peace. These brilliant achievements and glorious struggle history of our people's army are worthy of pride for every Chinese person.
    We all know that although the American robbers were beaten so badly by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield that they had to sit down for armistice negotiations, they did not give up. On the one hand, they played rogue tactics at the meeting, trying to detain our captured personnel in order to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations; on the other hand, they continued to carry out inhuman bombing in Korea and Northeast China, and shamelessly used bacteriological weapons on a large scale; at the same time, they stepped up the arming of West Germany and Japan, preparing to launch a larger-scale war of aggression. These beastly acts of the American robbers are too hateful! We absolutely cannot tolerate them, and we must severely punish them.
    In order to defeat the enemy's aggressive offensive, in order to prevent the enemy from daring to invade us, in order to protect our happy life and the construction of the motherland, we must build a strong national defense force.
    Therefore, when commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, all of us workers should be determined to do a good job in the production increase and economy practice movement to build our strong national defense force. Now, our group and our factory have already made this year's production increase and economy practice plan. Everyone is very enthusiastic about production and has the confidence and determination to complete the task. Old workers have put their minds to work, actively looking for tricks, and enthusiastically teaching us young workers their rich experience little by little without reservation. We young workers have also changed our arrogant and complacent attitude and our wrong attitude of not respecting old workers, and we are humbly learning from the master craftsmen to improve our skills again and again. We know that by doing this, we are responding to Chairman Mao's call, and we are building a strong economic force and national defense force to support our People's Liberation Army and People's Volunteers.
    Last year, on National Day, I saw our powerful People's Liberation Army with modern equipment in front of Tiananmen Square, and I also saw the heroic People's Volunteers' delegation returning to the country. I believe that with such a good people's army, with such a powerful people's army, we will definitely be able to defeat any enemy!
    When commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, I feel even more that our people's army is connected to our people by flesh and blood. Without the bloodshed and sacrifice of the People's Liberation Army, there would be no us today; without the heroic battle of the People's Volunteers, the construction of our motherland would not be guaranteed. Therefore, we must do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and we must care for and take care of the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers in every possible way, and solve all the difficulties that can be solved for them. This is our own bounden duty.

    努力搞好增产节约运动，百倍地增强国防力量
    工业劳动模范  郝建秀
    “八一”建军节来到了。今年的“八一”，是我们人民的军队——中国人民解放军诞生二十五周年的日子。中国人民解放军在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，经过二十多年的英勇斗争，从胜利走向胜利，现在已经发展成为保卫祖国安全和保卫世界和平的一支强大的武装力量。
    我们人民的军队、伟大的中国人民解放军有着光辉的历史：在第二次国内革命战争当中，它粉碎了蒋介石匪帮的五次围攻，英勇地保卫了革命人民的利益。在抗日战争当中，它抗击了百分之九十五的伪军和百分之六十四的日寇，最后并在苏联红军的配合下打败了日本帝国主义。在祖国解放战争当中，它消灭了八百多万被美国强盗武装起来的国民党匪军，解放了中国全部大陆；现在，中国人民解放军保卫着全中国人民的安全，保卫着祖国。我们人民的另一支军队——中国人民志愿军，为了帮助咱们的邻居——朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义的侵略，在朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，沉重地打击了美国强盗，打乱了美帝国主义侵略中国、侵略亚洲和全世界的计划，保卫了祖国的安全和世界和平。我们人民军队的这些辉煌的成绩和光荣的斗争史，值得我们每一个中国人民骄傲。
    我们都知道，美国强盗在朝鲜战场上虽然被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打得不得不坐下来进行停战谈判，可是它并没有死心，它一方面在会场上耍无赖，要扣留我们的被俘人员，以拖延、破坏停战谈判；另一方面继续在朝鲜和我国东北进行没有人性的轰炸，并且下流地、大规模地使用了细菌武器；同时，更加紧武装西德和日本，准备发动更大规模的侵略战争。美国强盗的这些兽行是太可恨了！我们是绝对不能容忍的，我们一定要严厉地惩罚他们。
    为了打败敌人的侵略进攻，为了使敌人不敢侵犯我们，为了保卫我们的幸福生活和保卫祖国建设的进行，我们一定要建设强大的国防力量。
    因此，在纪念“八一”建军节的时候，我们全体工人都应该下定决心，努力搞好增产节约运动，来建设我们强大的国防力量。现在，我们小组和我们工厂都已经订出今年的增产节约计划。大家的生产热情都很高，都有信心、有决心完成任务。老工人都开动了脑筋，积极找窍门，并热心地把他们的丰富经验一点一滴都不保留地教给我们青年工人；我们青年工人也改变了骄傲自满和不尊重老工人的错误态度，虚心地向老师傅们学习，要把我们的技术提高再提高。我们知道，我们这样做就是响应了毛主席的号召，就是为了建设强大的经济力量和国防力量，来支持我们的人民解放军和人民志愿军。
    去年国庆节的时候，我在天安门前看到了我们的现代化装备的强大的人民解放军，也看到了英勇的人民志愿军归国代表团，我相信有了这样好的人民军队，有了这样强大的人民军队，我们就一定能战胜任何敌人！
    在纪念“八一”建军节的时候，我更加感觉到我们人民的军队是和我们人民血肉相连的。没有人民解放军的流血牺牲，就没有我们的今天；没有人民志愿军的英勇战斗，我们祖国的建设也就没有保障。因此，我们一定要把拥军优属工作做好，无微不至地关怀和照顾烈属、军属和革命残废军人，给他们解决一切可能解决的困难，这是我们自己应尽的责任。
