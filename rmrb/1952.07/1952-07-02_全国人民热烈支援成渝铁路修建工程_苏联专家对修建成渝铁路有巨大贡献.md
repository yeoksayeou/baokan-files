    The rapid success of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction owes greatly to the support of the entire nation. Over the past two years, nearly 5,000 tons of large and small locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, bridges, tools, and steel billets have been transported monthly from Northeast, North, East, and Central-South China. Every single item in these abundant materials from all over the country was domestically produced and quite exquisite. This was a great encouragement to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway workers.
    Workers across the country are very concerned about the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction project. Their enthusiasm was extremely high when they heard they were manufacturing materials or transporting materials for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Dockworkers in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places voluntarily requested to reduce freight rates when handling equipment and materials for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. One of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway's current machinery plants was originally the Jiulonggang Machinery Plant under the Jinan Railway Administration. When the plant was relocated, the leadership originally estimated that some employees might be unwilling to leave their hometowns for Sichuan. However, once it was announced that the plant was moving to Chongqing, all the employees requested to go and build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Not even a single screw was lost during the relocation.
    The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a newly built railway, and there is a shortage of technical and management personnel. Under the call of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, more than 1,200 railway cadres from eleven railway administrations, from Heilongjiang to Guangdong, were transferred to work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; and 200 assistant personnel were transferred to work temporarily. They helped solve complex technical problems and undertook the task of initial construction work. For example, the bridge engineering team sent by the Hengyang Railway Administration helped erect bridges along the line and establish regular bridge management work. The road maintenance demonstration teams sent by the Shanghai and Jinan Railway Administrations promoted road maintenance work on the entire Chengdu-Chongqing line and helped train nearly 300 worker backbones in the new road maintenance method. The Northwest Railway sent a signal engineering team and specialized personnel in signaling. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration sent cadres to help establish financial inspection work for traffic operations. Personnel from the China Changchun Railway brought various advanced experiences. Chongqing, Neijiang and other stations have recently promoted the Yang Maolin loading method from the Shenyang Railway Administration, which has greatly increased the cargo load per flatcar compared to before.

    Soviet experts provided enthusiastic assistance in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; Soviet advanced experience has been widely applied in various projects. From roadbed construction, bridge erection, and tunnel excavation to laying sleepers, laying rails, and manufacturing steel rails, a series of Soviet advanced experiences were absorbed.
    Soviet experts helped build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway based on the Central People's Government's principle of "using local materials" and the actual conditions in the Southwest region. Soviet expert Zasydaev inspected the terrain along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and understood that there was a lot of weathered rock along the line, and the roadbed needed to be filled very high in many places. If the general filling method was used, allowing the roadbed to settle naturally, it would take at least a year before the rails could be laid, and another year after the rails were laid before it could be officially opened to traffic. He suggested implementing the "layered filling and ramming method." The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway adopted this advanced method, which made the roadbed both solid and quick to open to traffic. Soviet expert Sirin saw that the Southwest lacked steel materials, and it would be difficult to build a large number of steel bridges on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. He suggested that local stone materials be used for small bridges and culverts along the line, adopting China's inherent stone arch bridges, saving the country a large amount of steel and cement, while ensuring the bridges and culverts were just as solid. He also saw that there was a lot of rain in Sichuan and suggested adding a waterproof layer to bridges, culverts, and tunnels. This would extend the life of the bridges, culverts, and tunnels, and also increase the safety of traffic.
    Soviet experts always pay attention to improving the skills of our workers and technicians, so that our economic construction moves towards modernization. Soviet expert Gikhnov, just after getting off the plane from Beijing to Chongqing and without even resting, went to the Tuojiang Bridge construction site to help the bridge construction engineers use the Soviet dragging bridge construction method, temporarily riveting several steel bridge spans together and sliding them to the bridge site with steel wires and winches. This method was easy, safe, and fast, reducing the erection time of the Tuojiang Bridge by two months compared to the ordinary bridge construction method. In order to expand the steel soaking furnace of the 101 Steel Plant and increase the output of steel rails, Soviet expert Makarov organized the plant's engineers to carry out all the design, drafting, and installation work. He did not rest on holidays and personally went to the plant to work with workers and technicians until the steel rails were rolled out from the soaked steel billets before he felt relieved. Soviet experts also brought the latest Soviet-style steel rail drawings to the 101 Steel Plant, so that China, which had just begun to roll out the most backward steel rails, was able to roll out the world's latest steel rails in one leap. The weight of the steel rails was reduced from 42 kilograms per meter to 38 kilograms, and the driving safety and speed were increased. This was a major contribution to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.
    Soviet experts are always meticulous in their calculations for us, making the project economical, solid, and fast. However, in the course of the work, some individual technicians did not well accept the help of Soviet experts. For example, the layered filling and ramming method, some people initially thought that it had never been done before and that this method wasted manpower. Later, seeing the rapid opening of the railway, they all praised it. When erecting the Tuojiang Bridge, the bridge engineering team engineer used I-beams as support beams, but the Soviet expert looked at it and said it couldn't be used, and suggested changing to steel rails. The engineer didn't believe it, but as a result, the I-beams twisted and the steel beams still weren't supported. Only then was he truly convinced by the Soviet expert's suggestion.

    全国人民热烈支援成渝铁路修建工程
    苏联专家对修建成渝铁路有巨大贡献
    成渝铁路的迅速修建成功，全国各地的支援曾起了重大作用。两年来，从东北、华北、华东、中南各地运来的大小机车、客车、货车、桥梁、工具和钢胚等物料，平均每月就近五千吨。这些来自祖国各地的丰富资材，任何一件都是本国出品，而且都相当精致，这对于成渝铁路职工是一个极大的鼓舞。
    全国各地工人非常关怀成渝铁路的修建工程。他们一听说是为成渝铁路制造器材或为成渝铁路运输器材时，热情极高。上海、汉口等地码头工人在搬运成渝铁路的器材和物资时，自动要求减低运价。成渝铁路现在的一个机厂，原是济南铁路管理局所属九龙岗机厂。当这个厂迁移时，厂的领导方面原估计可能有些职工不愿离开家乡到四川，但一经宣布该厂搬往重庆，职工们都要求去建设成渝铁路。在迁厂中，连一颗螺丝钉也没丢掉。
    成渝铁路是新建铁道，技术和管理人员都很缺乏。在中央人民政府铁道部号召下，从黑龙江到广东，有十一个铁路局共一千二百多铁路干部调到成渝铁路工作；还有二百名助勤人员调来临时工作。他们帮助解决了复杂技术问题和担任了初创工作的任务。如衡阳铁路局派来助勤的桥工队，就帮助沿线架设桥梁和建立正规的桥梁管理工作。上海、济南两铁路局派来的养路示范队，就推动了成渝路全线的养路工作，帮助培养了按新法养路的工人骨干近三百人。西北铁路方面派来了信号工程队和号志等专门人员。郑州铁路局派来干部帮助建立行车营业的财务检查工作。中长铁路来的人员，更带来各种先进经验。重庆、内江等车站，最近推广沈阳铁路局的杨茂林装车法，使平车载货量较前大大增加。

    在成渝铁路修筑过程中，苏联专家热忱帮助；苏联先进经验已被广泛地应用在各项工程中。从修路基、架桥、开隧道、一直到铺枕木、铺轨和制造钢轨，都吸取了苏联的一系列的先进经验。
    苏联专家是根据中央人民政府“就地取材”的原则和西南地区的实际情况，来帮助修筑成渝铁路的。苏联专家扎司达耶夫考察了成渝铁路沿线的地形，了解沿线多风化石，许多地方路基要填得很高，若用一般填土方法，让路基自然沉落，至少在一年后才能铺轨，铺轨后再待一年才能正式通车营业，他建议实行“分层填土打夯法”。成渝铁路采用了这个先进方法，路基既坚固，通车又迅速。苏联专家西林看到西南缺乏钢料，成渝铁路大量架设钢桥是困难的。他便建议沿线小桥涵利用当地石料，采用中国固有的石砌拱桥，给国家节省了大量钢料和水泥，桥涵也照样坚固。他又看到四川雨水多，建议桥涵隧道加铺防水层。这样可延长桥涵隧道的寿命，也增加了行车的安全。
    苏联专家时刻注意提高我国工人、技术人员的工作技能，使我国的经济建设走向现代化。苏联专家吉赫诺夫，从北京到重庆，刚下飞机还没休息，就到沱江大桥工地，帮助架桥工程人员运用苏联的拖拔架桥法，把几孔钢桥临时拼铆在一起，用钢丝和绞车把它滑到桥位。这方法轻易、安全、迅速，使沱江大桥架设时间较普通架桥法减少了两个月。苏联专家马卡洛夫为了扩大一零一钢铁厂的烘钢炉，提高钢轨产量，组织厂里工程师进行全部设计和制图安装工作。他假日不休息，亲自到该厂和工人、技术人员一起工作，直到烘出的钢胚轧出钢轨后才放下心来。苏联专家并把苏联最新式的钢轨图样带到一零一钢铁厂，使中国刚开始轧出最落后的钢轨，一跃而能轧出世界上最新式的钢轨。钢轨的重量由每公尺四十二公斤减为三十八公斤，而且行车安全，速度增高。这对成渝铁路是一个重大的贡献。
    苏联专家处处为我们精打细算，使工程节约、坚固、迅速。但在工作过程中，个别技术人员没有很好接受苏联专家的帮助。如分层填土打夯法，最初曾有人认为从来没有这样做过，这方法浪费人力。后来看见铁路迅速通车，才齐声赞美了。架设沱江大桥时，桥工队工程师用工字铁做托梁，苏联专家看了说不能用，建议改用钢轨，工程师不相信，结果工字铁扭坏了，钢梁仍没托上，这才对苏联专家的建议心悦诚服了。　（新华社）
