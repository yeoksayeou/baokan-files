Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: July 26th was the deadline stipulated by the San Francisco Peace Treaty for the so-called withdrawal of all countries' occupying forces from Japan. But in reality, the American occupation forces not only continue to be stationed in Japan under the new guise of so-called "security forces," but also forced Japan to sign an agreement on providing military bases on the 26th, further strengthening the American occupation of Japan.

    This US-Japan military base agreement was formulated by the US-Japan Joint Committee established under the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," and is nominally a so-called "Facilities and Areas" agreement. According to this agreement, Japan must continue to provide the US troops with a total of 603 "general facilities" such as barracks, army, navy, and air force training grounds, airports, and naval bases, of which 300 are for indefinite use by the US military and 303 are for "temporary use." These "facilities and areas" include eleven airports and eighteen auxiliary air force bases, thirty-one barracks, thirty-two ground force training grounds, two naval bases, and eighteen large residential areas. At the same time, the agreement also stipulates that the US military can continue to occupy 671 private residences until March next year. According to Kyodo News, in addition to this, there are several agreements on "communication facilities" and "civilian intelligence departments," etc., which have not been published as secret agreements concerning military secrets.

    At the same time, the British Commonwealth occupation forces will continue to remain in Japan under the identity of the so-called United Nations forces, and the United Kingdom and Japan are negotiating on the continued use of Japanese military bases by the British Commonwealth forces. On the 25th, the Yoshida government first reached an agreement with the so-called United Nations forces authorities, recognizing the privilege of United Nations forces personnel to freely enter and leave the Japanese border and be exempt from property tax and income tax.

    美侵略者加强对日本的占领
    强制日本签订军事基地协定
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：七月二十六日是旧金山和约规定的所谓各国驻日占领军撤离日本的最后期限。但在实际上，美国占领军不仅用所谓“安全部队”的新招牌继续驻扎在日本，并在二十六日又强制日本签订了一项提供军事基地的协定，进一步加强美国对日本的占领。
    这项美日军事基地协定是根据美日“行政协定”成立的美日联合委员会制订的，名义是所谓“设施和区域”协定。根据这个协定，日本要向美国驻军继续提供营房、海陆空军演习场、飞机场、海军基地等“一般设施”共六百零三处，其中由美军无限期使用者有三百处，“暂时使用”者三百零三处。这些“设施和区域”包括十一个飞机场和十八个辅助空军基地、营房三十一处、地面部队演习场三十二处、海军基地两处、大住宅区十八处。同时，协定又规定美军在明年三月以前还可以继续占用私人住宅六百七十一处。据共同社透露，除此以外，还有若干关于“通讯设施”和“民间情报部”等的协定，作为有关军事机密的秘密协定，未予发表。
    同时，驻日英联邦占领军也将以所谓联合国军的身份继续留驻日本，日英双方正就英联邦军继续使用日本军事基地的问题进行谈判。二十五日，吉田政府已首先与所谓联合国军当局获致协议，承认联合国军人员有自由出入日本国境和免征财产税与所得税的特权。
