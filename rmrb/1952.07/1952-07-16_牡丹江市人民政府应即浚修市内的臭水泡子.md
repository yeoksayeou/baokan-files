    The Mudanjiang Municipal People's Government Should Immediately Dredge the Stinking Ponds in the City

    The southern district of Mudanjiang City, near the northern bank of the Mudanjiang River, is a relatively bustling area within the city. There is a long, stinking pond here, into which all the sewage from the city's sewers flows. Its outlet is very small, causing the sewage to accumulate; every spring and summer, the stench is overwhelming, and mosquitoes and flies breed. Citizens have raised the suggestion of dredging this stinking pond in the city's past People's Representative Conferences, but the problem has not been resolved. To improve public health in the city, the Mudanjiang Municipal People's Government should pay attention to the people's demands and quickly dredge it.

    牡丹江市人民政府应即浚修市内的臭水泡子
    牡丹江市南区，靠近牡丹江北岸，这是市内比较热闹的地方。这里有一条很长的臭水泡子，全市下水道的臭水都流到这里来。它的出口很小，因而臭水淤积；每到春夏两季，臭气薰天，蚊蝇繁殖。市民在该市历次各界人民代表会议中，都曾提出浚修这个臭水泡子的建议，但问题一直没有解决。为了改进市内的公共卫生，牡丹江市人民政府应该重视人民的要求，迅速加以疏浚。        何正平
