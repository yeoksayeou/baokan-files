    Achievements in Patriotic Health Campaigns in Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and Other Places
    Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign in Chengdu, five mass clean-up drives have cleared over 90,000 tons of accumulated garbage and dredged over 125,000 meters of ditches. The Dabei Lane stinky river, which had not been dredged for over 200 years, has been transformed into a clear water river after this dredging.
    In Kunming, over 6,000 cartloads of garbage were cleared in four days during the environmental sanitation effort. The Southeast District's stinky river, which had been foul-smelling for decades and extended over 900 meters, has been converted into a culvert capable of controlling water volume, greatly improving the environmental sanitation for nearby residents. The city's dirtiest places, such as the vegetable market, horse station, slaughterhouse, and dairy farm, have also seen a new look of cleanliness and hygiene.
    Guiyang City has been conducting comprehensive drinking water disinfection at all wells and wharves since June 5th, and local residents have organized drinking water management teams.
    According to incomplete statistics: over 50,000 tons of garbage that had not been cleared for decades have been removed in the entire Southern Jiangsu region. More than 170,000 rats have been caught, and large numbers of flies and mosquitoes have been exterminated. A large number of toilets have been built and renovated. Environmental sanitation has been greatly improved in many areas.
