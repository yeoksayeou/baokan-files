    Communist Party Member Zhu Zhiwei's Twenty Years of Hard Struggle
    Jiang Qing
    Zhu Zhiwei, the head of the logistics department of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army and a Communist Party member, has maintained the glorious tradition of the Party's hard work and simplicity for twenty years, and has been happily and actively working for the interests of the people and the motherland.
    He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1932 and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the same year. From being a squad leader to being the head of the logistics department, the long-term hard struggle has tempered him into an excellent soldier with a firm stance who loves the motherland and the people.
    Unwavering Stance
    In the twenty years of hard revolutionary struggle, Zhu Zhiwei has undergone countless severe tests. Every test has shown that he has a clear and firm class stand.
    In the second year of his participation in the Red Army, in a place called Maochang, the Kuomintang bandit army secretly surrounded their troops. The situation at the time was critical. He was ordered to lead a squad to defend a strategic hilltop to cover the transfer of troops. The enemy concentrated their firepower to take the hilltop, but one charge after another was defeated. Zhu Zhiwei's squad members were wounded and sacrificed one after another in the fierce battle. In the end, he was the only one left in the entire squad. Bullets and grenades were also used up. At this time, the enemy timidly shouted from the hillside: "Your troops have left, hand over your guns!" Zhu Zhiwei thought: "I am a party member, I would rather die than hand over my gun!" He clenched his bayonet and waited. After a while, the enemy swarmed up, and an enemy who touched him from the side grabbed his military cap. At this time, Zhu Zhiwei aimed at the chest of an enemy in front of him and stabbed him with a knife, then quickly picked up his gun and jumped off the cliff.
    He did not sacrifice himself. After waking up, he endured the pain and walked in the gully for a day, and returned to the Red Army.
    In 1935, during the extremely difficult Long March, his knee was injured in battle, and it was difficult for him to move. The superiors arranged for him to recuperate at a fellow villager's home. He only stayed for half a day and couldn't bear it anymore. He said to himself: "No matter what, I can't leave the Party!" Thinking of this, he felt energized all over. He walked with a cane, limping and following the troops, following Chairman Mao resolutely northward. When climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, his wound was so painful that it pierced his heart. However, his strong belief in the Party and the revolutionary cause and his infinite loyalty enabled him to overcome all difficulties and finally reach Yan'an victoriously.
    These are his deeds in the war years, and there are many such deeds.
    With the development of the national victory situation, the troops moved from the countryside to large cities. The environment has changed, but Zhu Zhiwei has not relaxed his fighting spirit because of this. On the contrary, he has further improved his class vigilance, because the Party has repeatedly taught him: When entering the city, be careful of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets.
    In 1950, the troops were stationed in Nanning. Zhu Zhiwei was then the supply minister of the division. More than a dozen car shop owners wanted to get some benefits from him, so they tried to attack him. They knew that Zhu Zhiwei liked to smoke, so they sent him top-quality cigarettes as soon as they met, but he still smoked his own inferior cigarettes. On New Year's Day in 1951, these car shop owners jointly sent him pigs and cakes, but he resolutely refused. At that time, he warned his subordinates: "We must not forget the Party's teachings and must be vigilant.奸商 (cunning merchants) are omnipresent, and we must give them nowhere to drill!"
    Burying Yourself in Work Day and Night
    Working diligently and selflessly is Zhu Zhiwei's consistent characteristic in his work for twenty years.
    In 1936, when the troops' supply was very difficult, Zhu Zhiwei served as the quartermaster. At that time, everyone only had two cents a day and couldn't afford any vegetables. He thought: "If the troops can't eat well, it will affect the battle; I am a Communist Party member, can I bow my head to difficulties?" He repeatedly asked the villagers for advice and found out that vegetables were cheaper thirty miles away, so regardless of the high mountains and long roads, the hot sun, he carried a small burden to buy vegetables himself. When he came back, his clothes were wet and stuck to his back, and his head was dizzy from the sun; however, in order to improve everyone's food, he was still busy grinding rice flour at night. Everyone knows that the job of quartermaster is quite hard, but Zhu Zhiwei did it extremely happily. Especially when he saw the soldiers had vegetables to eat and soup to drink, he felt that there was no work more glorious or happier than this. Therefore, he became more and more energetic. The food in their unit has long been better than the whole regiment. He was loved by the soldiers.
    Zhu Zhiwei has been engaged in economic work since 1936, and it has been sixteen years now. For sixteen years, wherever the work is most繁重 (heavy, onerous), he
    must be there.
    In 1950, the Guangxi bandit suppression troops were scattered in the mountains and ridges three hundred miles outside of Nanning, and transporting supplies was an arduous and important task. He found a way to solve this difficulty. He tried to negotiate vehicles, went to the site to supervise the loading of vehicles, and arranged armed convoys and other work. For a few days, the work was so intense that he didn't have time to eat, so he chewed pancakes while working. Some cadres advised him to pay attention to his health, and he said with a smile: "What does this count for! If we are a little tired, won't it guarantee the health of the soldiers?" Day and night, he only thought about one question: how to make the troops' supply better. To this end, he had repeatedly taken the机关 (office) cadres to the bandit suppression troops to understand the specific situation of supply work in depth. He carried a blanket, walked dozens of miles a day, went to the company to talk to the soldiers, listened to their opinions, and then convened supply cadres on the spot to study and solve the existing problems.
    Zhu Zhiwei's spirit of working selflessly for the Party gave his subordinates great education and moved them deeply. The quartermaster section chief who had worked with him for seven years said: "Even a machine is tired, but he will never be tired. In the past seven years, I have seen him have headaches and eye pains dozens of times, but I have never seen him stop working."
    Love Public Property
    Zhu Zhiwei cherishes all public property very much. He often said: "Comrades, it's not easy, every stitch and thread we use is the blood and sweat of the people!"
    In 1945, once, the troops passed through the Tongpu Road blockade line, and the situation was very tight at the time. He took four mules and驮 (carried) the entire regiment's "housework," traveling more than one hundred and eighty miles a day. Many comrades had fallen behind, but he still followed the troops closely. Before and after crossing the railway, the troops ran forward, and he personally pulled the mules to run. At this time, suddenly a mule翻 (turned over) the驮子 (burden). What to do? The situation was very urgent, and there were few people. Zhu Zhiwei thought: "This is public property! We must protect it no matter what!" He stayed alone, quickly and calmly unloaded the items one by one,重新驮好 (reloaded), and caught up with the troops.
    In Nanning, Zhu Zhiwei was afraid that the humid climate in the south would damage the materials in the warehouse. He went to the warehouse two or three times a day to check the packaging and拆洗 (unpacking and cleaning) work. When building an ammunition warehouse in a certain place, he went to check the warehouse equipment from a long distance. He often patiently taught the warehouse managers: "Be especially careful, one炮弹 (artillery shell) is equal to a middle peasant's one-year expenses!"
    Zhu Zhiwei is incompatible with waste. He responsibly controls economic expenditures. He educated some people who like extravagance: "A revolutionary cadre should think about the interests of the country everywhere, and it is very shameful to be斤斤计较 (nitpicky) about personal material enjoyment!"
    Simple Life, Diligent Study
    Zhu Zhiwei's personal life has been very simple for twenty years.
    The house he lives in today is a small old house. The clothes he uses are also very simple. He puts all his energy into work and study. When he is finished, he eats whatever he has, without any care. The year before last, according to the treatment, he could already eat小灶 (special small kitchen for high-ranking officers), but he didn't let the comrades mention this matter. He said: "The middle kitchen is very good, don't increase the burden on the people!" Later, the superiors officially notified him that he should eat小灶 (special small kitchen for high-ranking officers); but to this day, he still eats中灶 (middle kitchen) with the section chiefs. Zhu Zhiwei likes to smoke and drink tea; but the cigarettes he smokes are inferior cigarettes costing 11,000 yuan a条 (per pack), and he drinks粗茶叶 (coarse tea leaves).
    Comrades admire Zhu Zhiwei's consistent style of hard work and simplicity; but some individual cadres have insufficient understanding of this. Once in Nanning, when he was undergoing a physical examination, Zhu Zhiwei took off his呢子 (woolen) uniform, but he was wearing
    an old背心 (undershirt) with four lines of seams sewn on the front and back. Some cadres felt that this was too "寒酸" (shabby). He immediately criticized this thinking. He said: "We are glorious people's soldiers, and hard work and simplicity are our noble qualities. We省吃俭用 (economize on food and clothing) for the people, what's so shabby about that? Feeling shabby everywhere is really a manifestation of blurred class consciousness!" He warned the comrades: "We must always remember Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction: Winning the national victory is only the first step in the Long March. There are still many things to be done, and there are still long and arduous roads to be taken. We must share the hardships with the broad masses of the people and always promote the excellent tradition of hard work and simplicity."
    In addition to work, Zhu Zhiwei is very active in learning. At the beginning of joining the army, he was a person who did not know a single character. After twenty years of work and study, he now has a fairly high level of education. He reads newspapers and writes whenever he is free, and practices keeping a diary all year round. He has the spirit of willingly being a primary school student, therefore, cooks, feeders, and communicators are all his teachers. In January of this year, he signed a "package teaching and learning" contract with a clerk in the transportation section, determined to quickly improve his cultural level. He said: "The situation is developing rapidly, and many new things are waiting for us to learn. The Party has given us the great task of building a modern and powerful national defense force. Only by studying hard and constantly improving ourselves can we accomplish it well!"

    坚苦奋斗二十年的共产党员朱志为
    江清
    人民解放军某师后勤处处长、共产党员朱志为，二十年来一直保持着党的坚苦朴素的光荣传统，为人民和祖国的利益愉快地积极工作着。
    他在一九三二年加入中国共产党，同年参加了中国工农红军，他从当班长直到当后勤处处长，长期的坚苦斗争把他锻炼成一个立场坚定、热爱祖国和人民的优秀战士。
    坚定不移的立场
    在二十年坚苦的革命斗争中，朱志为经过了无数次的严重考验。每一次的考验都表明他有明确而坚定的阶级立场。
    他参加红军的第二年，在一个叫毛场的地方，国民党匪军偷偷包围了他们的部队。当时的情势是危急的。他奉命带一个班坚守一个险要的山头，掩护部队转移。敌人集中火力想拿下这个山头，但是一次跟一次的冲锋都被打垮。朱志为班的战士们在激战中相继负伤、牺牲了。最后，全班只剩下了他自己。子弹和手榴弹也都打光了。这时，敌人胆怯地在山坡下喊：“你们部队走了，交枪吧！”朱志为想：“我是党员，宁死也不交枪！”他握紧刺刀等着。一会儿，敌人蜂拥而上，一个从侧面摸上来的敌人，一手抓走了他的军帽。这时朱志为照准面前一个敌人的胸膛，一刀插进去，然后迅捷地提着枪纵身跳下了山崖。
    他没有牺牲。苏醒以后，他忍着痛在山沟里走了一天，又回到了红军队伍里。
    一九三五年在万分艰苦的长征途中，他的膝盖在战斗中负了伤，行动很困难。上级把他安置到老乡家休养。他只呆了半天就再也忍不住了。他对自己说：“不管怎样，我也不能离开党！”想着这，他感到全身都来了劲。他拄着棍子，一步一拐地跟着部队，跟着毛主席坚决北上。爬雪山、过草地时，他的伤口痛得扎心。但是他对党、对革命事业的强烈信念和无限忠心，使他战胜了一切困难，终于胜利地到达了延安。
    这是他在战争年代的事迹，像这样的事迹是很多的。
    随着全国胜利形势的发展，部队由乡村进驻大城市。环境改变了，但朱志为并未因此而松懈了斗志，相反的，他更加提高了自己的阶级警惕，因为党曾多次地教导他：进入城市，要当心资产阶级的糖衣炮弹。
    一九五○年部队驻防南宁。朱志为当时是师的供给部长。有十几家汽车行的老板想从他身上捞一些油水，就想法向他进攻。他们知道朱志为爱抽烟，因此，一见面就把上等香烟送过来，但他还是抽自己的次等烟。一九五一年元旦，这些汽车行老板曾联合给他送猪送饼，都被他坚决拒绝了。当时他告诫下级说：“不能忘了党的教导，要提高警惕。奸商无孔不入，我们必须给他们一个无孔可钻！”
    日以继夜地埋头工作
    兢兢业业、忘我地埋头工作，是朱志为二十年来工作中的一贯特点。
    一九三六年，正是部队的供给十分困难的时候，朱志为担任了司务长。当时每人每天只二分钱，吃不到什么菜。他想：“部队不能吃好饭，作战就会受影响；我是一个共产党员，难道能向困难低头？”他多次向老乡请教，打听到三十里外的蔬菜比较贱，于是不顾山高路远，太阳火热，自己担上小挑去买菜。回来后衣服湿得贴在背上，脑瓜都晒晕了；但是，为了改善大家的伙食，晚上他还忙着磨米粉。司务长这份工作，大家都知道是相当辛苦的，但是朱志为做得极其愉快。尤其当他看到战士们有菜吃有汤喝的时候，他觉得再没有比这工作更光荣、更快乐的了。因而越做越有劲。他们单位的伙食，长期都是全团较好的。他受到了战士们的敬爱。
    朱志为从一九三六年开始搞经济工作，到现在已经有十六年了。十六年来，哪儿工作最繁重，他就
    一定在哪儿。
    一九五○年，广西的剿匪部队都分散在南宁三百里外的丛山峻岭里活动，运输给养是个艰巨而重要的工作。他设法解决了这个困难。他奔走交涉车辆，到现场督促装车，并布置武装护车等工作。有几天，工作紧张得使他没有时间吃饭，他就一边嚼大饼，一边工作。有的干部劝他要注意健康，他笑呵呵地说：“这算得了什么！我们累一点不就保证了战士们的健康吗？”日里夜里，他只想着一个问题，就是：如何把部队的供给搞得更好。为此，他曾不止一次地带着机关干部到剿匪部队中去，深入了解供给工作的具体情况。他背着一条毯子，一天步行几十里，到连队里找战士们谈话，听他们的意见，然后就地召集供给干部研究和解决所存在的问题。
    朱志为忘我地为党工作的精神，给下级极大的教育，使下级受到很深的感动。和他一同工作了七年的军需科科长说：“是机器也疲倦了，但他永远不会疲倦。七年来我见他头痛、眼痛几十次，但我从没见过他中止过工作。”
    爱护公共财产
    朱志为对一切公物都十分爱护。他常说：“同志们，不容易哪，我们用的一针一线都是人民的血汗啊！”
    一九四五年，有一次，部队通过同蒲路封锁线，当时情况很紧。他带着四个骡子，驮着全团的“家务”，一天赶了一百八十多里。很多同志都掉队了，他仍紧紧地跟着队伍前进。过铁道前后，部队跑步前进，他就亲自拉着骡子跑。这时候突然有一头骡子翻了驮子。怎么办呢？情况很紧急，人又少，朱志为想：“这是公家的财物！无论如何也要保住！”他独自留下来，迅速沉着地把东西一件件卸下来，重新驮好，又赶上了队伍。
    在南宁，朱志为唯恐南方气候潮湿，仓库里的物资会受到损失。他每天都到仓库两三次，检查包装和拆洗工作。在修建某地弹药仓库时，他从很远的地方去检查仓库设备。他常常耐心地教导仓库管理人员：“要特别小心，一颗炮弹就等于中农一年的费用！”
    朱志为跟浪费现象是不相容的。他负责地掌握着经济开支。他教育某些爱好铺张的人说：“一个革命干部应该处处为国家的利益着想，在个人物质享受上斤斤计较是非常可耻的！”
    生活俭朴，学习勤苦
    朱志为的私人生活，二十年来都是很朴素的。
    他今天住的屋子，是一间窄小的旧房。他用的衣物也十分简单。他把全部精力放在工作和学习上。忙完了，有啥就吃啥，毫不计较。前年，按待遇他已经可以吃小灶了，但他不让同志们提这个事。他说：“中灶很好了，不要增加人民的负担！”后来上级正式通知他，要他吃小灶；但直到今天，他还是和科长们一道吃中灶。朱志为喜欢抽烟、喝茶；但他抽的烟是一万一千元一条的次等烟，喝的是粗茶叶。
    对朱志为这种一贯坚苦朴素的作风，同志们十分敬佩；但也曾有个别干部对此认识不足。有一次在南宁检查身体，朱志为脱了呢子制服，里面却穿着
    一件旧背心，胸前胸后缝补过四道线。有的干部就觉得这样未免太“寒酸”了。他立即批判了这种思想。他说：“我们是光荣的人民战士，坚苦朴素是我们的高贵品质。我们省吃俭用为的是人民，这有什么寒酸？处处感到寒酸，实在就是阶级意识模糊的一种表现！”他告诫同志们说：“要时时刻刻记住毛主席的英明指示：夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。要办的事还很多，要走的艰苦道路还很长，必须和广大人民共甘苦，永远发扬坚苦朴素的优良传统。”
    朱志为除工作外，学习非常积极。参军之初，他还是一个大字不识的人，经过二十年的工作和学习，现在已经有相当高的文化程度了。他有空就看报和写字，并常年地练习着记日记。他有着甘当小学生的精神，因此，炊事员、饲养员和通讯员都是他的老师。今年一月，他和运输科的一个科员订了“包教保学”的合同，决心要迅速提高文化水平。他说：“形势发展得快，很多新鲜事物正等我们学习。党交给我们建设现代化强大国防军的伟大任务，只有努力学习，不断地提高自己，才能很好地完成它！”
