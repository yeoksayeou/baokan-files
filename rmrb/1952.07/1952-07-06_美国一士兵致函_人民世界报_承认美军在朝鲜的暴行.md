Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 4th (TASS dispatch): "People's World" published a letter from an anonymous American soldier, praising the efforts of progressive people for peace and acknowledging the atrocities committed by Americans in Korea. The letter said: "I am a young soldier who served in the infantry in Korea for eighteen months, and I just returned recently. I was wounded twice, and I have been awarded several times for valor in battle.
    ...I have only been familiar with your newspaper for a few weeks. Although I don't completely agree with everything you say, I want to let you and your readers know that what you say about Korea and the terrible things happening in Korea is true.
    I want to thank you all for your efforts for peace, because I can clearly see that this is the only way. ...I can now see that it is a few big men here who create all the misfortune and constantly plunge the world into terror and war, while subjecting us to unnecessary sacrifice and disability.
    As for these atrocities, I pray to God to forgive the terrible things I did in Korea. What you have heard is only a small part of the truth."

    美国一士兵致函“人民世界报”
    承认美军在朝鲜的暴行
   【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约四日电：“人民世界报”刊载了一个匿名的美国兵士的来信，信中盛赞进步人民为和平所作的努力，并承认美国人在朝鲜犯下了暴行。该信说：“我是一个年青的兵士，曾在朝鲜步兵部队服役了十八个月，最近刚刚回来，我曾两次受伤，并且我曾因战功而数次受奖。
    ……我熟悉你们这份报纸还只是数星期之前的事。虽然我不完全同意你们所说的话，但是我愿意使你们以及你们的读者知道你们所说的关于朝鲜的事以及在朝鲜发生的可怕的事情都是真实的。
    我要感谢你们大家为和平所作的努力，因为我能够很清楚地认识到这是唯一的方法。……我现在可以看出：那些制造一切不幸和使世界经常陷于恐怖与战争之中，同时使我们受到不必要的牺牲和残废的正是此间的少数大人物们。
    至于这些暴行，我祈求上帝饶恕我曾在朝鲜作过的可怕事情。你们所听到的只是事实的一小部分而已。”
