The heinous plot of the American imperialists to use bacteriological warfare to salvage their military defeat has been severely countered by all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. Since April, while carrying out intense tasks such as road construction, the comrades of our company have actively carried out sanitation work, especially achieving great results in rat and insect extermination. By June 20th, the entire company had killed over 80,000 rats and 2 million insects.

After the higher authorities instructed us in April to launch a sanitation campaign to oppose bacteriological warfare, the company held a series of meetings – branch committee meetings, soldiers' congresses, Youth League congresses, sanitation warrior symposiums, epidemic prevention小组 meetings, etc. – to convey the instructions of the higher authorities, explain the great significance of opposing bacteriological warfare, and study specific methods for improving personal and environmental hygiene. Sanitation work began to develop. However, initial results in rat catching were not significant; by April 19th, the entire company had only caught thirty-one rats. Some comrades felt that rats were not easy to catch.

At this time, Liu Changde, a member of the Youth League from the twelfth squad, created several rat-catching tools. The most effective of these was a stone slab (supported by a small wooden stick, with two small horizontal sticks attached to the upper end of the wooden stick, and peanuts or corn attached to one end of the horizontal sticks as bait. When the rat eats the bait, it touches the wooden stick, and the stone slab falls, crushing the rat to death). This rat trap was simple to manufacture, and Liu Changde alone set up twelve of them, killing ten rats in three days.

The company promoted Liu Changde's rat-catching method and established an "Honor Roll" and "Victory Bulletin Board" to provide encouragement. On April 25th, to commemorate "May Fourth" Youth Day, Liu Changde challenged everyone, planning to catch thirty rats and 10,000 insects by the end of May. All the comrades in the company responded actively and launched a widespread rat and insect extermination competition. Everyone used their early morning and evening time to make rat traps and set up stone slabs, setting off a high tide of rat and insect extermination. Everyone proposed: "Don't forget to fight bacteriological warfare while working, and don't forget to make rat traps while resting," "Go wherever you go, and catch rats wherever you go." Many comrades caught rats near the construction site. Rat traps were set up everywhere within ten miles around the company headquarters. Some soldiers set up dozens of rat traps. By May 5th, the entire company had 6,663 rat traps and had killed 528 rats.

At the "May Fourth" Youth Day commemoration meeting, the entire company proposed to combine the current tasks with doing a good job in the anti-bacteriological warfare work. After the meeting, each squad put forward one to two people to specialize in rat catching. Everyone summarized past rat-catching experiences and found the rats' patterns of activity. Recently, because the weather was hot, rats were active in places near water. Rats were most abundant near rivers, piles of rocks in damp places, and mounds of earth in fields. Before setting up rat traps, the soldiers first scouted and discovered the rats' paths. Sometimes, to determine whether there were rats in a place, the soldiers would first sprinkle a little sorghum rice there. If the sorghum rice was eaten, they would then set up rat traps, making it easy to catch rats.

The soldiers used a tenacious fighting spirit to catch rats and exterminate insects. The soldier Yuan Zilin burned many apricot-sized blisters on his feet while helping Korean villagers fight a fire on the mountain, but he still did not relax his rat-catching work. Liu Changde didn't have time during the day, so he saved his allowance to buy batteries and went out at night with a flashlight to set up and inspect rat traps. Many comrades were busy from dawn to late at night, and as soon as they had time, they went to set up rat traps, even skipping their noon naps. Some squads assigned specific people to catch rats, and other comrades worked together to complete their work. The soldiers said: "In order to defeat the American imperialists' bacteriological warfare and for the safety of the people, it doesn't matter if we suffer a little more."

Because of this, the number of rat traps in our company gradually increased, and by the end of May, the entire company had more than 24,000 traps. Every day, one to two thousand rats were killed. When the rats nearby were caught, the soldiers went to places very far away to set up rat traps.

After our rat-catching achievements spread, some people initially didn't believe it. On May 28th, the first company sent three comrades to our place to inspect. They followed our soldiers to check separately. The soldier Wen Junkui from the eighth squad set up seven hundred rat traps alone. That day, he only inspected two hundred traps and found forty rats had been caught. The other two people also only inspected a portion of the rat traps set up by two soldiers in our company and found that one hundred and eleven rats had been caught.

Statistics on May 31st showed that the entire company had already caught 23,535 rats. At the beginning of June, a summary was conducted again, and the eighth squad, which had the best results, won the red flag. The entire company then set a plan to catch 30,000 rats in June. The enthusiasm of all the comrades in the company for catching rats and exterminating insects continued to rise and quickly broke through the plan. By June 20th, our company had achieved the results of catching more than 80,000 rats and exterminating 2 million insects.

    我们连队捕杀了八万多只老鼠
    志愿军某部二连副政治指导员  荆聿莲
    万恶的美帝国主义妄想用细菌战来挽救它的军事惨败的阴谋，已受到我志愿军全体指战员和朝鲜军民的严重打击。从四月间开始，我们连的同志们在执行修路等项紧张任务的同时，积极展开了卫生清洁工作，特别是捕鼠灭虫的成绩最大。到六月二十日为止，全连捕杀了老鼠八万多只和昆虫二百万只。
    四月间上级指示我们以开展卫生运动来反对细菌战以后，连里召开了一系列的会议——支部委员会、军人大会、团员大会、卫生战士座谈会、防疫小组会议等，传达了上级的指示，说明了反对细菌战的重大意义，并研究了搞好个人卫生、环境卫生的具体办法。卫生工作初步开展起来了。但最初捕鼠的成绩不大，到四月十九日为止，全连只捉了三十一只老鼠。有的同志感到老鼠不容易捉。
    这时候，十二班的青年团员刘长德，创造了好几种捕鼠的工具。其中最有效的一种是石板（用一根小木棍支起石板，木棍的上端再安上两根小横棍，横棍的一端装上花生米或玉米做食饵。老鼠吃饵时触动木棍，石板倒下把老鼠压死）。这种捕鼠器制造简单，刘长德一个人就安设了十二个，在三天中捕杀了十只老鼠。
    连里推广了刘长德的捕鼠方法，并设立了“荣誉榜”和“捷报栏”来进行鼓动。在四月二十五日，刘长德为纪念“五四”青年节，向大家提出挑战，他个人计划在五月底前捕鼠三十只、捕虫一万只。全连同志积极响应，广泛展开了捕鼠灭虫竞赛。大家利用早晚时间做捕鼠器、安石板，掀起了捕鼠、灭虫的高潮。大家提出：“做工不忘反细菌战，休息不忘做捕鼠器”，“人到那里，就到那里捕鼠”。许多同志就在工地附近捕鼠。连部附近十里地的周围，到处安设了捕鼠器。有的战士一个人就安设了好几十个捕鼠的石板。到五月五日为止，全连共有捕鼠器六千六百六十三具，捕杀了老鼠五百二十八只。
    在“五四”青年节纪念大会上，全连又提出要结合当前的任务，做好反细菌战的工作。会后，各班都推出了一人至二人，专门研究捕鼠。大家总结了过去捕鼠的经验，找到了老鼠出没的规律。最近因为天气较热，老鼠出没在近水的地方。如河边、潮湿地的石头堆、田地里的土堆附近，老鼠最多。在安设捕鼠器之前，战士们首先进行侦察，发现老鼠往来的路径。有时，为了判定一个地方有没有老鼠，战士们先在那儿撒一点高粱米，如果高粱米被吃掉了，再去安设捕鼠器，很容易捉到老鼠。
    战士们以顽强的战斗精神来捕鼠、灭虫。战士元子林因为帮助朝鲜老乡上山救火，脚上烧了许多杏子大的泡，但他还是没有放松捕鼠工作。刘长德白天没有时间，他省下津贴买了电池，夜晚打着手电出去安设和检查捕鼠器。许多同志从天亮忙到很晚，一有功夫就去布置捕鼠，连午觉也不睡。有的班抽出专人来捕鼠，其他同志共同完成他的工作。战士们说：“为了打败美帝国主义的细菌战，为了人民的安全，我们多吃点苦没有什么关系。”
    因为这样，我连的捕鼠器陆续增加，到五月底，全连有了二万四千多具。每天捕杀一千到两千只老鼠。附近的老鼠被捉光了，战士们又跑到很远的地方去安置捕鼠器。
    我们的捕鼠成绩传出后，最初有些人不相信。五月二十八日，一连派了三位同志到我们这儿来检查。他们分头跟着我们的战士去检查。八班战士文俊奎一个人安设了七百具捕鼠器，那天只检查了二百具，就发现了被捕的老鼠四十只。另外两个人也只检查了我连两个战士所设的捕鼠器的一部分，就发现了捉到的老鼠有一百十一只。
    五月三十一日统计，全连已经捕鼠二万三千五百三十五只。六月初又进行了总结，成绩最好的第八班获得了红旗。全连又订出了六月份捕鼠三万只的计划。全连同志捕鼠、灭虫的情绪继续高涨，很快就突破了计划。到六月二十日为止，我连就达到捕鼠八万多只、灭虫二百万只的成绩了。
