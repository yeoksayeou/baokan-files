    (I) How to Commemorate the August First Army Day
    August First Army Day is approaching. We extend our highest respect and warm gratitude to the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, which, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has fought heroically for twenty-five years, won the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, and continues to heroically defend the motherland and the people, and to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting heroically on the Korean front. We extend our cordial greetings to all revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, honorary servicemen, and wounded and sick comrades. Immortal glory to all the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary war and the struggle to defend the motherland!
    Through twenty-five years of heroic struggle and construction in combat, our People's Liberation Army has developed into a first-class powerful people's army in the world. It is not only the strong defender of our motherland, but also the strong defender of peace in Asia and the world. Our People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have severely打击 the American aggressors on the Korean front, forcing them to sit down for armistice negotiations. However, American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, constantly violates our airspace, and uses barbarous bombing,掃射, and the release of toxic bacteria to harm our people, and tries its best to expand the war of aggression against Korea to our country. Therefore, when commemorating the August First Army Day this year, we must not relax our fighting will and combat readiness for a moment; on the contrary, we should vigorously strengthen our national defense construction work and build our People's Liberation Army into a strong, modernized national defense force, ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade our airspace and borders, defend the economic construction of the motherland, and defend peace in Asia and the world.
    In order for our army to well undertake this glorious and great task, when commemorating the August First Army Day this year, we should carry out universal current affairs education within the entire army, so that all personnel in our army understand their position and role in the cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace today, and intensify the study of politics, culture, and military technology to accelerate the construction of a modern national defense force. All troops and military organs across the country should hold commemorative gatherings in their駐地 (and may also invite local masses and militia to participate), where the leaders of the troops and organs will report on the history of the construction and development of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the current situation and tasks, and call on the people and troops to jointly strengthen the work of national defense and economic construction. At the meeting, heroic model figures from the troops, representatives of the masses, and militia representatives can be invited to speak to encourage and learn from each other.
    What should local governments and people's organizations do? First, they should educate the broad masses of the people to cherish the People's Army and call for actively carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to support the Chinese People's Volunteers with the victory on the economic construction front and ensure all the materials and financial resources needed for the modernization construction of the People's Army. We have done a lot of work in this regard in the past, and we must continue to carry out and strengthen this work. Second, we should strengthen the construction of local militias. In places where there are no militias, militias should be established through extensive publicity and mobilization; in places where there are already militias, an inspection should be carried out to ensure that the work of the militias is done practically and conscientiously, so that the militias become a guarantee of local security. Third, we should do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, military families, honorary servicemen, and wounded and sick soldiers. We have accumulated a lot of experience in this regard in the past, which should be summarized and promoted so that this work can be carried out smoothly and correctly.
    In order to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of revolutionary soldiers and the masses of the people, and to make everyone understand the significance of their work and struggle in defending and building the country, we should mobilize troops and the masses to write letters to the families of martyrs, military families, honorary servicemen, wounded and sick soldiers, combat heroes, and labor models around the August First Army Day. Such letters have proven to have a huge encouraging and educational effect in the past, and they should be carried out more conscientiously now.
    In order to promote the above work, local newspapers and other propaganda organs should publicize the past achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the revolutionary war around August First, publicize the important role of the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and defending world peace today, and appropriately introduce the current achievements in building a modernized national defense force under the principle of not divulging state and military secrets, so as to inspire the enthusiasm of the troops and the masses.

    （一）怎样纪念八一建军节
    八一建军节就要到了。我们谨向二十五年来在中国共产党和毛主席正确领导下英勇奋战、赢得了中国人民解放战争的胜利、并在继续英勇保卫着祖国和人民的伟大的中国人民解放军以及英勇地战斗在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军致以崇高的敬意和热忱的感谢，向一切革命烈属、军属、荣誉军人和伤病员同志们致以亲切的慰问。一切在革命战争中和保卫祖国的斗争中壮烈牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    经过二十五年来的英勇战斗和战斗中的建设，我们的人民解放军已经发展成世界上第一流的强大的人民军队。它不仅是我们祖国的坚强的保卫者，也是亚洲以至世界和平的坚强的保卫者。我们的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在朝鲜前线沉重地打击了美国侵略者，使他们不得不坐下来进行停战谈判。但是美帝国主义现在仍然侵占着我国领土台湾，不断地侵犯我国领空，用野蛮的轰炸、扫射和施放毒菌来残害我国人民，极力企图把侵略朝鲜的战争扩大到我国境内。因此，在今年纪念八一建军节的时候，我们一刻也不能松懈我们战斗的意志和战斗的准备；相反的，应该大力加强我们的国防建设工作，把我们的人民解放军建设成强大的近代化的国防军。以准备随时打击任何敢于侵犯我国领空和边疆的敌人，保卫祖国的经济建设，保卫亚洲以至全世界的和平。
    为着使我们的军队能很好地担当这种光荣伟大的任务，在今年纪念八一建军节的时候，应该在全军范围内普遍进行时事教育，使我们军队中全体人员了解自己今天在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平事业中的地位与作用，加紧学习政治、文化和军事技术，以加速现代化国防军的建设。全国的部队和军事机关，应该在驻地举行纪念集会（也可邀集地方群众、民兵共同参加），由部队和机关首长报告人民解放军的建设和发展的历史，以及当前的形势与任务，号召人民群众和部队合力加强国防与经济的建设工作。会上并可邀请部队英雄模范人物、群众和民兵代表讲话，以资互相勉励和学习。
    各地政府和人民团体应该做些什么呢？第一、应该向广大人民群众进行爱护人民军队的教育，号召积极开展增产节约运动，以经济建设战线上的胜利来支援中国人民志愿军，并保障人民军队现代化建设所需要的一切物资与财力。过去我们在这方面已经做了许多工作，现在仍须继续进行并加强这一工作。第二、应该加强地方民兵的建设工作。在没有民兵的地方，要经过广泛的宣传动员，建立民兵；在已有民兵的地方，要进行一次检查，把民兵的工作切实认真作好，使民兵成为地方安全的保障。第三、做好烈属、军属、荣誉军人的优抚工作。这方面我们过去已有很多经验，应该总结推广，使这一工作能顺利地正确地进行。
    为了激励革命军人和人民群众的爱国热情，使每个人都明了自己所进行的工作和斗争对保卫国家和建设国家的意义，应该发动部队和群众在八一建军节前后向烈属、军属、荣誉军人、伤病员、战斗英雄、劳动模范普遍写信。这种信件过去已经证明是具有巨大鼓舞教育作用的，现在应该更认真地进行。
    为推动上述工作，各地报纸和其他宣传机关应该在八一前后宣传人民解放军过去在革命战争中的功绩，宣传人民解放军今天在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平中的重大作用，在不泄露国家和军事机密的原则下，适当地介绍目前建设现代化国防军的成就，以鼓舞部队和人民群众的热情。
