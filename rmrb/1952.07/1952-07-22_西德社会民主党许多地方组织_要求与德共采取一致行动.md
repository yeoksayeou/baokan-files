Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 19th: According to TASS, at a meeting held on the 12th in Mannheim, at the invitation of the Central Council of the "Socialist Action Committee," Social Democrats from all over Germany adopted a twelve-point program calling for united action with the German Communist Party to overthrow Adenauer and to hold four-power negotiations to discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This program will be presented at the German Social Democratic Party National Congress scheduled for September in Dortmund. Leaders of many local, district, and state organizations of the Social Democratic Party voted in favor of this program.

The program calls on everyone to oppose the war treaties signed by Adenauer not only through parliamentary struggle but also through mass rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and popular votes. The program points out that the Social Democratic Party must spare no effort to promote the holding of four-power talks, must stop the slander campaign against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and must replace the occupation regime with a just peace treaty.

The program calls on the Social Democratic Party and those who oppose Adenauer's domestic and foreign policies to first form a fighting united front with the Communists to oppose the militaristic Schuman Plan, the "Agricultural Plan" that advocates the establishment of a single agricultural product market in Europe, and the terrorist decrees. The program calls on people to thwart Adenauer's attempt to force parliament to pass an election law that is unfavorable to the workers' parties, and to oppose the banning of the German Communist Party. The program also calls for the prohibition of all fascist and pro-fascist groups, the nationalization of important industries, banks, and insurance companies, the implementation of land reform, the development of peaceful industries on the basis of a planned economy, and the reform of the tax and education systems.

    西德社会民主党许多地方组织
    要求与德共采取一致行动
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：应“社会主义行动委员会”中央理事会的邀请，于十二日在曼海姆开会的从德国全国各地去的社会民主党人，通过了一个十二点纲领，要求和德国共产党采取一致行动，打倒阿登纳，并且举行四国谈判来讨论缔结对德和约问题。这个纲领将在定九月间在多特蒙德举行的德国社会民主党全国代表大会上提出。社会民主党的许多地方组织、区组织和州组织的领袖们都投票拥护这个纲领。
    这个纲领号召大家除了在议会中进行斗争以外，还要用群众大会、示威、罢工和人民投票的方式来反对阿登纳所签订的战争条约。这个纲领指出：社会民主党必须不遗馀力地促进四国会谈的举行，必须停止对苏联和人民民主国家的诽谤运动，并且要用公正的和约来代替占领统治。
    这个纲领要求社会民主党和反对阿登纳的国内政策、外交政策的人们首先要和共产党人结成战斗的统一体，来反对军国主义的舒曼计划，反对主张在欧洲成立单一的农业产品市场的“农业计划”，反对恐怖主义的法令。这个纲领号召人们挫败阿登纳想强迫议会通过不利于工人政党的选举法的企图，并且反对取缔德国共产党。纲领还要求禁止一切法西斯团体和亲法西斯团体，把重要工业、银行和保险事业收归国有，实行土地改革，在计划经济的基础上发展和平工业，并且改革税收制度和教育制度。
