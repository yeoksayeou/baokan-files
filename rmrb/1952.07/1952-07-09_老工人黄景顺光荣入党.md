    Veteran Worker Huang Jingshun Gloriously Joins the Party
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Chen
    Huang Jingshun, a sixty-four-year-old veteran worker and deputy director of the maintenance department workshop at the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, has been educated in communist ideology at the Shanghai Workers' Political School, and his class consciousness has been further enhanced. He was gloriously admitted to the Chinese Communist Party before July 1st.
    Someone once asked Huang Jingshun, "You are so old, why do you still want to join the Communist Party?" Huang Jingshun laughed when he heard this. He said, "I used to have this kind of thinking too. At the beginning of January this year, I wanted to join the Communist Party, but at that time I was afraid that I was old and didn't know many characters, would the Party approve me to be a Communist Party member? So I kept thinking about it in my heart. But after studying here for a month and a half, it seemed like there was a burst of energy, and my eyes seemed to brighten up a bit. To be honest, I really realized that the Communist Party is the party of our working class, and Chairman Mao led us to stand up!" Saying this, he was afraid that others would not understand, and added, "I was born in the Guangxu era. Based on my forty or fifty years of experience, I know that only the Communist Party's path is right, and the cause of communism is great. That's why I more urgently want to join the Party."
    On the day Huang Jingshun swore to join the Party, I visited this old worker. He was chatting with the workers about how to actively lead the workers to do a good job in production after joining the Party. As soon as he saw me, he pulled me over and said, "Today the Party has approved me to be a Communist Party member, and I am very happy. When I return to the factory, I must teach all the skills I have learned in the past thirty years to the young workers."
    In fact, when Huang Jingshun was studying at the Workers' Political School, he always couldn't forget the machines in the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. He said, "I can't bear to be away from the machines, I'm afraid others will damage them." Therefore, on Sundays when others went home to rest, he would go to the machine room to take a look and touch them. When he saw that the machines were fine, he would be happy, and at the same time, he would actively teach the young workers various experiences such as wiping cars, leveling cars, and arranging lines. A young worker said, "Old Huang is really good now! He is so old, and he still wants to join the Communist Party, it's really not easy! He is studying at the Workers' Political School, and he still comes to the factory on Sundays to teach us young people technology."
    "Why are you so actively teaching young workers to learn technology?" It seemed that the way the question was asked was not quite right, he glared at me and said, "I am an honest person, I can't speak well, I do what I say, everyone in the workers has learned the technology, everyone is actively working and creating, and jointly building a communist society, like building a pagoda, you have a brick, and I have a brick, isn't this can reach the communist society earlier? Isn't everyone can live the happiest life?"
    "Everyone actively creates, and arrives at the communist society earlier!" I couldn't help but be moved by this far-reaching communist ideal and his heroic determination. But when he saw my silence at that time, he sensitively thought that I had some doubts about his words, and laughed heartily.
    "Yes, I am old, it is not certain whether I can personally reach the communist society. We Chinese have an old saying: 'The predecessors plant trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade.' We are stepping up construction today, training young workers, and every labor creation and achievement will increase strength for our country's construction today and pave the way for the communist cause tomorrow. Even if I personally cannot see the communist society, our next generation will definitely be able to create a communist society."
    Huang Jingshun is an ordinary and simple old worker. He lost his mother when he was ten years old. He went out to sweep salt for five years and worked as a ship repairer for thirteen years. He entered a textile factory at the age of thirty to learn maintenance work. After experiencing more than fifty years of production and struggle, after he accepted the communist and communist ideological education, he became an active communist fighter.
    Huang Jingshun's experience is this: He actively participated in the strike struggle in the "May 30th" movement and served as a worker inspector. After the failure of the Great Revolution, in those dark days of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders' bloody rule, he followed everyone to continue to carry out work slowdowns and strikes, etc. At the same time, because he was upright and selfless, in his thirty years of history as a "Na Mowen" (foreman), he not only did not oppress workers and receive gifts, but also actively maintained the interests of his class brothers. During the Japanese puppet period, once a worker named Wang Bailong fell asleep in the workshop while slowing down work, and was seen by a Japanese foreman. Huang Jingshun came forward and made up a set of reasons for Wang Bailong to prevaricate, so that Wang Bailong avoided the suffering of being beaten and deducted wages.
    But before liberation, his understanding of why to struggle and who led the working class to struggle to victory was not very clear. After liberation, under the direct leadership and cultivation of the Communist Party, he saw that the Communist Party served the workers everywhere. His own doorstep used to be a stinking ditch and muddy ground, but now it has been repaired into a wide road. In the past, evil bullies, hooligans, and counter-revolutionaries who ran rampant in western Shanghai were all caught in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. When the factory implemented labor insurance in 1951, he was so moved that he couldn't sleep at night. Thinking about the past in the Kuomintang reactionary period, he didn't dare to tell his real age, fearing that if he was over sixty years old, people would not want him. Now elderly workers still have pensions. The Communist Party is really the workers' own party. He said: "Heart for heart, the Communist Party does everything for us workers, how can we repay Chairman Mao?"
    These concrete facts enhanced his understanding of the Communist Party. During the wage reform in January this year, he was promoted to assistant. During the "Three Antis" movement, he was promoted to deputy director of the steel strip rough workshop of the maintenance department. He said: "I never dreamed that I would be promoted to deputy director of the workshop." Huang Jingshun loves labor and loves machines. He proposed two rationalization proposals for improving the "steel wire damper" and "adding iron plates before and after the car feet," which extended the life of the steel wire car and reduced the waste of cotton lint. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, he went to work early, and when he was off work, he was still in the workshop repairing machines. He said: "The machine is my life, it is most important to maintain the machine. If the machine breaks down, production will stop."
    What enables veteran worker Huang Jingshun to quickly absorb new things and continue to move forward is his great enthusiasm for learning. On the night when the factory notified him to come to the Shanghai Workers' Political School to study, he was so happy that he couldn't wait for dawn, and he hurriedly got up at one o'clock in the middle of the night to go to the school. In the school, during the rest time after lunch or dinner, people could always see a worker wearing reading glasses, reading enthusiastically "Communist Society" and "How to Move Towards Communism" and other readers. More than fifty years of production and struggle experience, the suffering in those dark days under the Kuomintang rule, and the real happiness and joy after liberation, made him deeply realize that it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who lead the Chinese working class to victory.

### 老工人黄景顺光荣入党

    老工人黄景顺光荣入党
    新华社记者  李  沉
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂保全部车间副主任，六十四岁的老工人黄景顺，在上海工人政治学校，经过共产党和共产主义的思想教育，阶级觉悟更加提高，在“七一”前些日子，光荣地被吸收参加中国共产党了。
    有人曾经问过黄景顺：“你这样大年纪了，为什么还要参加共产党呢？”黄景顺一听就笑了起来。他说：“过去我也有这种思想。今年一月初，我就想参加共产党了，但是那时我怕年纪大又不识几个字，党会不会批准我做一个共产党员呢？所以一直在心里打转转。可是在这里学习了一个半月后，好像有一股劲，眼睛似乎也亮了些。说老实话，我真的认识了共产党是我们工人阶级的党，毛主席领导我们翻了身！”说到这里，他恐怕别人不明白，又补充了一句：“我是光绪年代生的，凭我四、五十年的经验，我知道只有共产党的路正，共产主义的事业伟大。所以我更迫切地要求参加党了。”
    在黄景顺宣誓入党的那一天，我访问了这个老工人，他正在和工人们畅谈着入党后应怎样积极领导工人搞好生产，一见到了我，就拉着我说：“今天党已经批准我做共产党员了，我真高兴极了。我回到厂里，一定要把我三十多年来所学的全套本事，教给青年工人们。”
    其实，黄景顺在工人政治学校学习的时候，他老是忘不了国营上海第一棉纺织厂的那些机器。他说：“我舍不得机器，怕别人把机器弄坏了。”因此星期日当别人回家休息时，他就钻到机器间里，去看看，摸摸，看到机器没毛病，他就高兴起来，同时又积极地把揩车，平车，排线等各种经验，教给青年工人们。有一位青年工人说：“老黄现在可真好呵！年纪这样大，还要求参加了共产党，可真不容易呵！自己在工人政治学校学习，星期天还到厂里来教我们青年人学技术。”
    “为什么你这样积极地教导青年工人们学技术呢？”似乎这问题提法不大对劲，他瞪了我一眼，说道：“我是老实人，不会说话，说到那块就做到那块，工人们大家都学会了技术，大家都积极劳动创造，共同来建设共产主义社会，好像堆宝塔一样，你一块砖，我也一块砖，这样不是可以早一些到达共产主义社会吗？不是大家都可过最幸福的生活了吗？”
    “大家都积极创造，早一些到达共产主义社会！”我不禁为这种远大的共产主义的理想和他的豪迈的决心所感动了。但是他看到我那时沉默的情景，敏感地以为我对他的话有些怀疑似的，爽朗地大笑起来。
    “是的，我老了，我个人能不能走到共产主义社会，那还不一定呢。我们中国有句老话：‘前人栽树，后人乘凉’。我们今天加紧建设，培养年青的工人，每一个劳动的创造和成就，都将为我们今天的国家建设增加力量，为明天的共产主义事业填平道路。我个人即使看不到共产主义社会，但是我们下一代一定能够创造出共产主义社会。”
    黄景顺是一个普通的平凡的老年工人，在十岁的时候没了娘，就外出扫了五年盐，做了十三年的修船工，三十岁时进纺织厂学保全工，前后经历五十多年的生产和斗争，当他接受了共产党与共产主义的思想教育后，就成了一个积极的共产主义的战士。
    黄景顺的经历是这样的：他在“五卅”运动中，积极参加罢工斗争，曾当过工人检查队员。大革命失败后，在国民党和日寇血腥统治的那些黑暗的日子里，他跟着大家继续进行磨洋工和罢工等斗争，同时由于他为人正直，大公无私，在他当“拿摩温”三十年历史中，不仅没有压迫过工人收过礼，而且积极维护了阶级弟兄的利益。在日伪时期，有一次工人王柏龙在车间里磨洋工睡着了，被日本工头看见。黄景顺就出头给王柏龙编了一套理由，搪塞了过去，使王柏龙避免了挨打与扣工资的苦头。
    但在解放前，他对为什么要斗争，谁领导工人阶级斗争走向胜利，认识是不十分明确的。解放后他在共产党直接领导与培养下，他看到共产党处处为工人服务。自己家门口以前是臭水沟，烂泥地，现在都修成为大马路了。过去横行沪西一带恶霸流氓反革命分子都在镇压反革命运动时捉光了。一九五一年厂里实行劳动保险时，他感动得晚上睡不着觉，想想过去在国民党反动派时期，自己不敢说出实年龄，怕满六十岁，人家就不要了，现在老年工人还有养老金，共产党实在是工人自己的党。他说：“人心换人心，共产党那桩事不为我们工人，我们怎么报答毛主席呢？”
    这些具体的事实，提高了他对共产党的认识。在今年一月工资改革时，他被提升为助理员，“三反”运动中，又被提升为保全部钢条粗车间副主任。他说：“我做梦也想不到会提拔为车间副主任。”黄景顺热爱劳动，热爱机器，曾提出改良“钢丝风门”和“车脚前后加铁板”的两个合理化建议，延长了钢丝车的寿命，并减少了花衣的浪费现象。在镇压反革命运动中，他提早上工，在放工时，他还在车间里检修机器。他说：“机器就是我的命，保养机器最要紧，机器一出毛病，生产就要停了。”
    使老工人黄景顺能很快地吸收新鲜事物，继续不断前进的，是他的学习劲头很大。当厂里通知他到上海工人政治学校来学习的那天晚上，他高兴得等不到天亮，还在深夜一点钟的时候，就急急忙忙起来想到学校去了。在学校里，每当中饭或晚饭后的休息时间里，人们总可以看到有一个戴着老花眼镜的工人，兴致勃勃地在读着“共产主义社会”及“怎样走向共产主义”等读本。五十多年生产和斗争的经历，在国民党统治时期那些黑暗的日子里所受的苦难，和解放后真正的幸福和快乐，使他深深地体会了领导中国工人阶级走向胜利的是毛主席和共产党。
