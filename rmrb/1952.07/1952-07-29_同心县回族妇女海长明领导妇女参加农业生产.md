    Hai Changming, a Hui Woman from Tongxin County, Leads Women in Agricultural Production

    Editor: In the past, most Hui women in our Northwest region did not participate in production and rarely left their homes. Since liberation, they have been educated and have now begun to participate in production, with many emerging as activists. Hai Changming, a Hui woman from the Third Village of the Fourth District of Tongxin County, Ningxia Province, is one of them.

    Hai Changming was originally very poor. In the past two years, thanks to the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, her life has begun to improve. She is wholeheartedly thinking of Chairman Mao's call: "Increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." This spring, when all the men in the village were organized to dig springs and wells, she also asked to participate. Many people said, "Women can't do this kind of work." But she didn't believe that women couldn't do such things. She discussed with her Hui sisters Li Wanqing, Yang Xiuying, Lu Fengying, and others how to organize and work together. In early April, Hai Changming led a group of sisters to borrow 3 million yuan in water conservancy loans from the People's Government, bought shovels, picks, and other tools, and started work. When they dug the well to a depth of more than two zhang (about 6.6 meters), they encountered a kind of white slurry stone, which damaged their tools and injured their hands. Some people lost heart. At this time, Hai Changming said to everyone, "We must respond to Chairman Mao's call and overcome all difficulties." Encouraged and led by her, everyone regained their energy and continued to work. By the end of April, they had dug five wells. As a result, not only did other women put forward the slogan of learning from them, but the labor enthusiasm of the men was also greatly encouraged. Driven by their hard work, the whole village dug thirty-six wells in less than a month. In addition, they also reclaimed six mu (about 0.4 hectares) of wasteland and planted potatoes and millet.

    Recently, the Tongxin County People's Government, in order to encourage and help this Hui women's mutual aid group led by Hai Changming, has specially loaned them a "Liberation-style" waterwheel. After receiving the waterwheel, they immediately transformed 20 mu (about 1.3 hectares) of dry land into paddy fields. They unanimously stated: They will guarantee to work hard to produce and improve agricultural production technology to repay the People's Government for their care.

    同心县回族妇女海长明领导妇女参加农业生产
    编辑同志：我们西北区的一般回族妇女过去是不参加生产的，甚至很少出家门。解放后，她们受到了教育，现在她们已经开始参加生产了，而且出现了不少的积极分子。宁夏省同心县第四区第三乡回族妇女海长明便是她们中间的一个。
    海长明本来也是很穷苦的。两年来由于共产党、人民政府的领导和帮助，她的日子开始好过了。她一心想着毛主席的号召：“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。”今年开春后，全乡男人都组织起来掏泉、凿井，她也要求参加。好多人说：“这事妇女干不了。”但她不相信妇女不能作这样的事情。她和回族姊妹李万清、杨秀英、陆凤英等商量着如何组织起来干。四月初，海长明领导着一小伙姊妹们向人民政府借了三十万元水利贷款，买了铁锹、镐头等工具就动工了。当她们挖井挖到两丈多深时，遇到了一种白浆石，因而工具震坏了，她们的手也震坏了。有的人就松了劲。这时，海长明向大家说：“我们要响应毛主席的号召，不论什么困难都要克服它。”在她鼓舞、带头下，大伙又鼓起劲干开了。到四月底，她们打好了五眼井。这一来，不仅其他妇女提出了向她们学习的口号，男人们的劳动情绪也受到了很大的鼓舞。在她们的苦干精神的推动下，全乡不到一个月就打好了三十六眼井。另外，她们还开了六亩荒地，种上了洋芋和糜子。
    最近，同心县人民政府为了鼓励、帮助海长明领导的这一个回族妇女互助组，又特贷给她们一架
    “解放式”水车。她们领到这水车后，立即把二十亩旱田变成了水田。她们一致表示：保证努力生产、提高农业生产技术，以报答人民政府对她们的照顾。杨海
