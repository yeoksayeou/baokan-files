The experience of factories and mines in North China in promoting advanced Soviet experience proves that it is necessary to strengthen leadership to promote advanced Soviet experience.
    Currently, there are dozens of advanced Soviet production experiences and advanced production management methods being promoted in the coal mine, iron and steel, machinery, and railway production systems in North China. The study of these experiences, whether partially implemented or universally promoted, has fully demonstrated the superiority of advanced Soviet experience from the beginning, giving industrial production a completely new look. For example, in machine repair and welding at the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory, only oxygen welding could be used in the past, which was both labor-intensive and prone to damage. Since the implementation of the Soviet bundled electrode cold welding method, these technically caused shortcomings have been overcome. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine needed to restore Mine No. 39, but it could not be carried out due to the deep water accumulation. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the rapid drainage method was adopted, which not only completed the drainage project but also shortened the working hours by 80% compared with the old drainage method. Ninety-five percent of the lathes in the Taiyuan Machinery Factory have adopted high-speed cutting, and some lathes have switched to multi-tool and multi-edge cutting, which has increased production efficiency by one to thirteen times. The Tangshan Power Plant adopted rapid maintenance, which was completed nine days and nine hours earlier than the old maintenance method, creating ten billion yuan of wealth for the country.
    However, to date, some people in various factories and mines blindly worship capitalist technical viewpoints and have serious conservative ideas. They still hold varying degrees of rejection towards the promotion of advanced Soviet experience. A more significant example is that although the advanced Soviet "Seagull" Leather Factory's complete set of advanced experience in saving leather is fully applicable to the Taiyuan Leather Factory, the factory's leading cadres and technical personnel emphasized that the factory was a semi-handicraft industry and refused to adopt it, resulting in a waste of 10 billion yuan of national wealth. The leadership of the Fengfeng Coal Mine planned to implement the Soviet coal mining method in one place, but engineer Li Xingqiao disagreed. He believed, "Doing so will inevitably increase costs and reduce output." Later, facts proved that the implementation of the Soviet coal mining method increased work efficiency by 20%. Li Xingqiao was still unconvinced, thinking he had lost face, and became ill with anger. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also suffered two serious accidents in the No. 2 blast furnace because it did not adopt the advice of Soviet experts.
    The facts of many factories and mines prove that to promote advanced Soviet experience, it is necessary to first strengthen the political leadership of the Communist Party organizations over factories and mining enterprises. When the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory began to prepare to implement the high-speed cutting method, most technicians and some workers, after hearing the introduction of the high-speed cutting method, did not believe it, as if it were a myth. Deputy Director Zhang Zhiling said, "What kind of machine tool can have such power?" He flipped through all the capitalist mechanical books, but could not find the theoretical basis for this advanced technology. So, he arbitrarily said, "Old machine tool equipment is not suitable for high-speed cutting." After the factory's Communist Party General Branch discovered these ideological situations, it called on party members to take the lead in demonstrating and guarantee the success of the high-speed cutting experiment, and organized a high-speed cutting team and a technical research team. With their vivid achievements, they educated the masses and gradually implemented the high-speed cutting method on 44% of the machine tools in the factory. Secondly, to promote advanced Soviet experience, it is necessary to strengthen leadership organizationally. Chahar Province has established a provincial-level advanced experience promotion committee, and two dedicated cadres have been set up in industrial and mining enterprises with more than 500 workers. It has been decided that this year, advanced experience should be mastered by the majority of employees, making it the dominant operating method. When the Taiyuan Tobacco Company implemented the Kovalev work method, the factory specially established a Kovalev work method promotion committee to promote it with leadership and in a step-by-step manner. They first concentrated on the advantages, conducted learning in sequence, and then comprehensively integrated the results and universally promoted them. The Taiyuan Machinery Factory established an advanced experience promotion committee, which simultaneously experimented with and promoted advanced experience while organizing the study of technical theory. When learning advanced Soviet experience, the factory workers combined it with summarizing their own experience, further improving their technical level, and then manufactured more complex and larger machines that the factory had never made before, such as coal cutting machines, drilling machines, and winches.
    In all factories and mines that have learned advanced Soviet experience, the political thinking of employees has greatly improved. The Yue Yuxiu team of the packaging department of the Taiyuan Tobacco Company learned the Kovalev work method, which increased output by 20% and achieved a quality of 99%. They intimately experienced the great role of advanced Soviet experience in the construction of the motherland. All ten members of the group joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and many of them have become model figures on the production front. Among the technical personnel, after criticizing bourgeois ideology, an atmosphere of learning advanced Soviet experience has also begun to form.

### 华北各厂矿经验证明推广苏联先进经验必须加强党的领导

    华北各厂矿经验证明推广苏联先进经验必须加强党的领导
    华北区各厂矿推广苏联先进经验的经验证明：推广苏联先进经验，必须加强领导。
    目前华北的煤矿、钢铁、机械、铁路等生产系统正在推广的苏联先进生产经验和先进生产管理方法有数十种。这些经验的学习，不管是部分试行或已经普遍推广，一开始便充分地显示了苏联先进经验的优越性，使工业生产面貌焕然一新。例如：张家口铁路工厂在机器检修、熔焊上，过去只能用氧焊，既费工料，又易破损，自从推行苏联的束状组成电焊条冷焊法后，就克服了这些技术上导致的缺点。焦作煤矿需要恢复三十九号矿井，但因蓄水太深，无法进行。经过苏联专家的指导，采用快速排水法，不仅完成排水工程，并且所用工时比旧法排水还缩短了百分之八十。太原机器厂已有百分之九十五的车床采用了高速切削，有部分车床改行了多刀多刃切削法，使生产效率提高了一倍到十三倍。唐山发电厂采用快速检修，比旧法检修提前九天又九小时完成，为国家创造了十亿元财富。
    但是，迄今为止，各厂矿还有一部分人盲目崇拜资本主义技术观点，严重存在着保守思想，他们对推广苏联先进经验还抱着程度不等的拒斥的态度。比较显著的例子，如：苏联“海燕”皮革厂整套的节约皮革的先进经验，虽然完全适用于太原皮革厂，但该厂领导干部和技术人员却强调本厂是半手工业的而拒不采用，结果浪费国家财富达一百亿元之多。峰峰煤矿领导方面拟在一处实行苏联采煤法，但工程师李星桥不同意。他认为：“这样做必然加大成本，降低产量”。后来，事实证明，实行苏联采煤法后，使工作效率提高了百分之二十。李星桥仍不服气，认为丢了他的面子，气得病了一场。太原钢铁厂也因为不采纳苏联专家的建议，致使二号高炉发生了两次严重事故。
    许多厂矿的事实证明：要推广苏联先进经验，必须首先加强共产党组织对厂矿企业的政治领导。张家口铁路工厂开始准备实行高速切削法时，一般技术人员和部分工人听了关于高速切削法的介绍后，竟像对待神话一样地不相信。副厂长张之铃说：“什么机床能有那么大的力量？”他把资本主义的一套机械书籍都翻遍了，怎么也找不到这个先进技术的理论根据。于是，他便武断地说：“旧机床设备不适于高速切削。”该厂共产党总支发现这些思想情况后，就号召党员带头示范，保证将高速切削试验成功，并组织高速切削小组和技术研究小组，以他们生动的成就，教育群众，逐步地在全厂百分之四十四的机床上实行了高速切削法。其次，要推广苏联先进经验，必须从组织上加强领导。察哈尔省已成立了省一级先进经验推广委员会，在五百名工人以上的工矿企业中设专责干部二人，决定今年要做到先进经验为广大职工所掌握，使之成为主导的操作方法。太原烟草公司实行郭瓦廖夫工作法时，该厂专门成立了郭瓦廖夫工作法推广委员会，有领导有步骤地加以推广。他们首先集中优点，依次进行学习，然后综合成果，普遍进行推广。太原机器厂成立了先进经验推广委员会，一面试验推广先进经验，一面组织技术理论的学习。该厂工人在学习苏联先进经验时，并结合总结了自己的经验，使技术水平更加提高了一步，进而制造出该厂从未做过的比较复杂和庞大的机器，如截煤机、钻探机、卷扬机等。
    凡是学习了苏联先进经验的厂矿，职工政治思想都有很大进步。太原烟草公司包装部岳玉秀小组学习了郭瓦廖夫工作法，使产量增加百分之二十，质量达到百分之九十九。他们亲切地体验到苏联先进经验对于祖国建设的伟大作用。全组十人都参加了中苏友好协会，并有不少人成为生产战线上的模范人物。在技术人员中，经过批判资产阶级思想后，也开始形成了学习苏联先进经验的空气。
