    Austrian "People's Voice" Exposes
    Van Fleet Admits US Germ Warfare Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 29th] TASS, Vienna, July 28th: The "Austrian People's Voice" published an article with the following content: "According to officers recently arriving at the US occupation forces headquarters in Austria, Washington has requested General Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth Army stationed in Korea, to explain how Chinese newspapers knew that Van Fleet had confirmed the fact that the United States was conducting germ warfare in northern Korea and China.
    According to those officers, Van Fleet explained that he did indeed confirm the US military's use of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological weapons, in a conversation with Mr. Scheffler, head of the Belgian mission in Tokyo, on March 2nd.
    However, Van Fleet pointed out that he was not the first to say this. Before he made this statement, Ridgway, Hickey, and other officials had mentioned and confirmed the use of germ weapons in private conversations with foreign envoys stationed in Tokyo.
    Van Fleet attributed the leak of his conversation to the Chinese newspapers to Scheffler, because Scheffler did not keep his promise and told the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Van Fleet's information.
    Van Fleet's conversation has been confirmed in Washington.
    Therefore, regarding this matter, Washington decided not to issue any denials, but only to pretend that nothing had happened. However, Van Fleet received a warning that he should not be so quick to speak about 'major confidential matters' in the future. He also received an order that he must strictly abide by the following instruction in the future: US official figures are strictly prohibited from talking to anyone about the use of bacteriological weapons."

    奥地利人民之声报揭露
    范佛里特承认美国进行细菌战罪行经过
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十八日电：“奥地利人民之声报”发表了一篇文章，内容如下：“据最近到达奥地利的美国驻奥地利占领军总部的军官说，华盛顿曾要求驻朝鲜第八军军长范佛里特将军解释中国报纸怎么知道范佛里特证实美国在朝鲜北部和中国进行细菌战的事实的。
    据那些军官说：范佛里特说明，他的确曾在三月二日与比利时驻东京使团团长薛佛勒里谈话中证实了美军使用包括化学武器和细菌武器在内的大规模屠杀武器的事实。
    但是范佛里特指出，他并不是第一个说这种话的人。在他发表这种谈话以前，李奇微、希凯及其他官员在和驻东京外国使节私人谈话时，都已曾提到而且证实使用细菌武器的事情。
    范佛里特把他的谈话走漏给中国报纸这一个错误归之于薛佛勒里，因为薛佛勒里没有遵守诺言而把范佛里特的消息告诉了比利时外交部。
    范佛里特的谈话已在华盛顿得到证实。
    因此，关于这件事情，华盛顿决定不发表任何否认声明，只装出没有这回事的样子。不过，范佛里特接到警告说，以后关于‘重大的机密事情’不能再这样嘴快了。他并且接到命令说：他将来得严格遵守下面这个指示——美国官方人物一律不准对任何人谈论使用细菌武器的事情。”
