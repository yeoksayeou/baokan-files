    Blindly Organizing Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Xiadiankou Natural Village, Xiuning County, Southern Anhui

    Editor's Note: The situation raised by reader Cheng Dunxun deserves the attention of comrades leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The leading cadres of Xiadiankou Natural Village in Xiuning County, Southern Anhui, disregarded the masses' level of awareness and experience, and forced the masses to organize agricultural production cooperatives without leadership backbone and sufficient preparation. As a result, the peasants' thinking became confused, a tendency to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants occurred, and production was hindered. These lessons should not be repeated in various places.

    Comrade Editor: Formalism and a tendency to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants have occurred in the organization of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Xiadiankou Natural Village, Landu Village, Ninth District, Xiuning County, Southern Anhui.

    The masses in this village have no experience in organizing themselves. In March of this year, village cadres, in response to the People's Government's call to "organize and develop production," began to organize mutual aid teams in the village. However, they themselves neither understood the significance of organizing nor knew how to organize. They compiled four mutual aid teams in the village. In April, Bi Chaofeng, the public security officer of this village, attended the meeting of mutual aid team leaders in the district. He heard that agricultural production cooperatives had many benefits. He believed that organizing agricultural production cooperatives was more respectable than organizing mutual aid teams. After returning to the village, he changed one mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative. Later, Bai Ruirong, a cadre of the County Democratic Women's Federation, came to the village to lead the mutual aid and cooperation work. Without asking about the specific conditions of the area and regardless of whether the peasants were ideologically prepared, she forced the peasants to establish three agricultural production cooperatives. She said to some peasants: "Sooner or later, you will have to organize agricultural production cooperatives. If you don't organize, you are ideologically backward and selfish. Are you not Chinese?" She also said: "You will always have to join the cooperative. Not joining the cooperative is a bourgeois idea. You must be willing to join even if you don't want to." Within three days, she organized three cooperatives.

    After these four cooperatives were established, they neither established various systems nor formulated production plans. Not only were they reduced to formalism, but also phenomena of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants occurred. Some poor and hired peasants in the cooperative were not educated on the significance of organizing and the prospects for development, and blindly joined the cooperative. They said: "We proletarians are now the masters of the house. We will manage and distribute the grain in the cooperative after the autumn harvest." They stipulated that land should be contributed as shares, dividends should be distributed according to population, the cooperative would use the members' cattle in a unified manner (without recording work points), and the members' farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds would not be recorded or priced, but would all belong to the cooperative as public property. They forced middle peasants to lend grain to poor and hired peasants to eat. Some poor and hired peasant members even wanted to sell the middle peasant members' cattle to exchange for grain to eat. The middle peasant Chen Meiying wanted to sell soybeans because her son needed money for schooling. The village public security officer Bi Chaofeng forbade her to sell them and asked her to lend the soybeans to the poor peasants to eat. Chen Meiying was dissatisfied and asked to withdraw from the cooperative. Bi said: "You can only withdraw if you leave three mu of land and one head of cattle to the cooperative." As a result, the middle peasants dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out, and became disheartened and passive in production. Some poor and hired peasants also did not actively work because they wanted to take advantage of the middle peasants. Thus, production was seriously affected. In mid-June of last year, the paddy fields in this village had been weeded three times, but this year, even two weedings have not yet been completed.

    In early June, the county's leading organs discovered this problem and organized forces to cooperate with the work team sent by the province and the special district's leading organs to go to inspect and resolve this problem.

    皖南休宁县下典口自然村盲目组织农业生产合作社
    编者按：读者程墩埙提出的情况值得领导互助合作运动的同志注意。皖南休宁县下典口自然村的领导干部不顾群众的觉悟水平和经验，在缺乏领导骨干，没有进行充分准备的情况下，强迫群众组织农业生产合作社，结果引起农民思想的混乱，发生了侵犯中农利益的偏向，妨碍了生产。这些教训，各地不应重复。
    编辑同志：皖南休宁县九区蓝渡村下典口自然村在组织互助合作运动中，发生了形式主义和侵犯中农利益的偏向。
    这村群众还没有组织起来的经验。今年三月间，村干部为了响应人民政府“组织起来发展生产”的号召，开始在本村组织互助组。但他们自己既不了解组织起来的意义，也不知道组织起来的办法，就在村里编制了四个互助组。四月里，这村的公安员毕朝凤到区参加互助组长代表会，听说农业生产合作社有许多好处，他便认为组织农业生产合作社比组织互助组更体面，回村后，就把一个互助组改为农业生产合作社。后来县民主妇女联合会干部白瑞荣到这村来领导互助合作工作，她不问当地的具体条件如何，不管农民在思想上有没有准备，又强制农民成立了三个农业生产合作社。她对一些农民说：“迟早都要组织农业生产合作社，你们若不组织，是思想落后，有私心，你们不是中国人吗？”又说：“你们总是要入社的，不入社是资产阶级思想。不愿意入社也得愿意。”在三天当中，她就把三个社组织起来了。
    这四个社成立以后，既没有建立各种制度，也没有订立生产计划。不仅流于形式，而且发生了侵犯中农利益的现象。社内的一部分贫、雇农没有受到关于组织起来的意义和发展前途的教育，盲目地入了社。他们说：“我们无产阶级当家作主人了，秋后社内粮食由我们管理分配。”他们规定土地入股，按人口分红，社员的耕牛由社统一使用（不记工），社员的农具、肥料、种籽，既不记账，也不作价，全部归社公有。他们强制中农借粮给贫雇农吃，有的贫雇农社员还想卖掉中农社员的耕牛换粮吃。中农陈梅英因为儿子读书用钱，想卖黄豆，村公安员毕朝凤不准他卖，要他把黄豆借给贫农吃，陈梅英不满意要求退社，毕说：“留下三亩田，一头耕牛给社里，才准你退出。”这样一来，中农敢怒而不敢言，在生产上灰心消极。有些贫雇农因为想占中农的便宜，也不积极劳动。这样，严重地影响了生产。去年六月中旬，这村的稻田已耘过三遍草，但今年到现在还没有耘完二遍草。
    六月上旬，县领导机关发现了这个问题，已经组织了力量，配合省和专区领导机关派来的工作组，前往检查和解决这个问题。
