Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 2nd. In the last five days of June, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces continued to repulse the provocations and incursions of the American invading army and the Li puppet army. The fighting on the Western Front was relatively intense. On the 26th, the American 45th Division, which had suffered many casualties in the past, again fiercely attacked a forward哨 (shào) outpost position of our army west of Tieyuan. Our defending troops immediately and bravely carried out resistance and counterattacks, annihilating enemy troops batch after batch on the mountain tops. The fierce battle lasted until the 29th, with the enemy suffering approximately 500 or more casualties. Under the command of the American invading army, the Li puppet army's 1st Division also attacked a high ground east of Shuoning on the 26th, launching more than ten consecutive charges, all of which were repulsed by our army, with the enemy suffering more than 300 casualties. In other areas of the Western Front, our army also continuously inflicted casualties on the enemy in frequent small battles. On the Eastern Front, an enemy battalion, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the area of Qubieyu and Xiatanli northwest of Gancheng on the 27th, but was resolutely repulsed by our army, with the enemy suffering more than 150 casualties.

The Korean and Chinese People's Forces continue to actively carry out anti-aircraft shooting campaigns, constantly inflicting heavy blows on enemy aircraft. According to incomplete statistics from the 20th to the 25th, our army shot down or damaged a total of 119 enemy aircraft on the front and in the rear.

On the 29th, our coastal defense troops in the Haizhou southeastern area of the west coast repelled a landing intrusion by an enemy company under the cover of warships with powerful artillery fire.
