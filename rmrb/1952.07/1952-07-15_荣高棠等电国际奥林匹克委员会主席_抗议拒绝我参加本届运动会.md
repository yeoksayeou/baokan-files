Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, and Dong Shouyi, member of the International Olympic Committee and member of the All-China Sports Federation Committee, sent telegrams to Edström, President of the International Olympic Committee, on July 5, protesting his unreasonable refusal to allow athletes from the People's Republic of China to participate in the 15th Olympic Games to be held in Helsinki on July 19.

In his statement, Rong Gaotang pointed out that Edström's telegram on June 17 stating that the All-China Sports Federation had not yet been recognized by the International Olympic Committee and that Chinese athletes could not participate in the Helsinki Olympic Games was completely unfounded. The All-China Sports Federation is the only national amateur sports organization in the People's Republic of China and fully possesses the right to participate in all international sports activities, including the Olympic Games. The All-China Sports Federation was reorganized from the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee, and no one should unreasonably obstruct our participation in the 15th Olympic Games. In his statement, Dong Shouyi also pointed out that, according to Articles 25 and 45 of the Olympic Charter, the All-China Sports Federation fully possesses the conditions and rights to send representatives to participate in the Olympic Games.

Note: The All-China Sports Federation was reorganized from the China National Amateur Athletic Federation (i.e., the Chinese Olympic Committee), which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee, after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. After the establishment of the All-China Sports Federation, it decided to continue to participate as a member of the International Olympic Committee and five international sports federations, including basketball, football, track and field, cycling, and swimming, and maintain regular contact with them. The All-China Sports Federation should have been invited to participate in the Olympic Games held in Helsinki in July. The Federation telegraphed the International Olympic Committee on June 4 to register, but was unreasonably rejected by Edström, President of the International Olympic Committee.

    荣高棠等电国际奥林匹克委员会主席
    抗议拒绝我参加本届运动会
    【新华社十四日讯】中华全国体育总会秘书长荣高棠和国际奥林匹克委员会委员、中华全国体育总会委员会委员董守义在七月五日分别致电国际奥林匹克委员会主席艾德斯特隆，抗议他无理拒绝我中华人民共和国的运动员参加七月十九日将在赫尔辛基举行的第十五届奥林匹克运动会。
    荣高棠在声明中指出：艾德斯特隆在六月十七日来电所称中华全国体育总会尚未被国际奥林匹克委员会所承认，中国运动员不得参加赫尔辛基奥林匹克运动会，是完全没有理由的。中华全国体育总会是中华人民共和国唯一的全国性业余体育组织，充分具有参加包括奥林匹克运动会在内的一切国际体育活动的权利。中华全国体育总会是由国际奥林匹克委员会承认的中华全国体育协进会改组而成的，任何人不得无理阻挠我们参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会。董守义在声明中并指出：根据奥林匹克章程第二十五条和第四十五条，中华全国体育总会充分具有派出代表参加奥林匹克运动会的条件和权利。
    按：中华全国体育总会是在一九四九年中华人民共和国成立之后，由国际奥林匹克委员会所承认的中华全国体育协进会（即中国奥林匹克委员会）改组而成的。中华全国体育总会成立后，决定继续参加国际奥林匹克委员会和篮球、足球、田径、自行车与游泳等五个国际运动联合会为会员，并与之保持经常联系。七月间在赫尔辛基举行的奥林匹克运动会，我中华全国体育总会应被邀请参加。该会曾在六月四日致电国际奥林匹克委员会报名，但遭到国际奥林匹克委员会主席艾德斯特隆的无理拒绝。
