Chen Shulan Group of the Fine Yarn Workshop of the Private Shashi Yarn Factory in Chongqing

Creates New Record in Shortening Doffing Time by Improving Working Methods

The Chen Shulan Group of the Fine Yarn Workshop of the Private Shashi Yarn Factory in Chongqing, based on learning and promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, improved the doffing (i.e., stopping the machine and taking the full bobbins off the machine and replacing them with new bobbins) work method, reducing the machine stoppage time for each doffing from thirty seconds to fifteen seconds, and also reducing yarn breakage, bad yarn, and fly waste after starting the machine. As a result, the whole group can produce an additional 5.45 bales of cotton yarn annually, save 6.6 bales of fly waste, and save 2.5 bales of raw cotton. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union has summarized this work method and is promoting it in textile factories throughout the city. Currently, the general doffing stoppage time for each machine in the fine yarn workshops of textile factories across the country is 35 to 45 seconds. If all factories learn the Chen Shulan Group's doffing work method, the gains will be even greater.

Taking the full yarn bobbins off and grabbing new bobbins from the box to insert onto the spindles are the basic actions of the doffing workers. If these actions are faster, the stoppage time is reduced, the machine utilization efficiency is increased, and the labor productivity is also increased. In the past, the doffing method was to first remove the yarn with the left hand, then insert the tube with the right hand, one after another. As a result, only one hand was working at a time, wasting a lot of time. After research, the workers of the Chen Shulan Group changed these two actions to be performed simultaneously, that is, the left hand only removes the yarn, and the right hand only inserts the tube. At the same time, they put the box containing the new tubes and the box containing the yarn tubes together in front of them, and pushed them to the left with their right foot instead of pulling them with their hand. In addition, they also researched and improved many specific actions. This greatly shortened the doffing time.

As for reducing yarn breakage after starting the machine, this is related to the method of stopping and starting the machine. The Chen Shulan Group also conducted detailed research and improvements on the method of stopping and starting the machine. For example, they found that it is best to stop the machine when the ring rail is swinging to the middle of the bobbin. At this time, due to the inertia of the machine, the yarn can be wound around the foot of the bobbin two to three times. After the yarn end is broken after doffing, the yarn end can still be wound around the spindle two to three times, so that the inserted bobbin can press the yarn end, and there will be no breakage after starting the machine. With the addition of other improvements, the group's breakage rate was significantly reduced, and roller waste was reduced from 5.25 pounds to 1.85 pounds per day.

The operation of the doffing workers has a high degree of collectivity. If one of the doffing workers is slow or not working well, it will affect the entire work. Therefore, the Chen Shulan Group also stipulated a method for the doffing leader to use whistle signals to direct the doffing, so that the actions of the entire group are consistent. At the same time, the Chen Shulan Group also attaches great importance to the preparation work before doffing and the mutual inspection work after doffing. These are also important reasons for them to reduce the doffing time. (Qian Dadong)

    重庆市私营沙市纱厂细纱车间陈树兰小组
    改进工作法创造缩短落纱时间新纪录
    重庆市私营沙市纱厂细纱车间陈树兰小组，在学习和推广郝建秀工作法的基础上，改进了落纱（即停车后把纺满纱的筒管由机器上取下来，换上新的筒管）工作法，由每台车每次落纱停车时间三十秒降至十五秒，并减少了开车后纱的断头、坏纱和回丝。全组因此每年可增产棉纱五点四五件，节约回丝六点六件，节约白花二点五件。中国纺织工会重庆市委员会已对这个工作法进行了总结，并已在全市纺织厂推广。现在，全国各纺织厂细纱车间一般每台车每次落纱停车时间是三十五秒至四十五秒。各厂如果都学习了陈树兰小组落纱工作法，其收获将会更大。
    把纺满纱的管纱拔下来，把新的筒管从盒子里抓出来插在锭子上，是落纱工人的基本动作，这些动作快了，停车的时间就减少，机器运用效率就提高，劳动生产效率也就随之增加。过去，落纱方法是左手先拔纱，右手后插管，换完一个再一个，结果是在同一时间内，只有一个手工作，浪费时间很大。陈树兰小组工人经过研究后，把这两项动作改为同时进行，即左手只管拔纱，右手只管插管。同时又把装新管的盒子和装管纱的盒子并在一起，放在身前，由右脚带动向左推进，不再用手去拉。此外，还研究和改进了许多具体动作。这就使落纱时间大大缩短。
    至于减少开车后纱的断头问题，这是和关车开车的方法有关的。陈树兰小组对关车开车的方法也进行了细致的研究和改进。例如他们研究出最好是当钢领板摇至管纱中部时关车，这时，因为机器的惯性作用，纱可以在筒管脚绕二至三转，待落完纱拉断纱头后，纱头还可以在锭子上绕二至三转，使插上的筒管可以压住纱头，开车后便不会有断头。再加上其它一些改进，该组断头率便显著减少，皮辊花由每天五点二五磅降到一点八五磅。
    落纱工人的操作带有很大的集体性，如果落纱工人中有一人工作动作迟慢或不好，就要影响整个工作。因此陈树兰小组又规定了落纱长用哨音指挥落纱的办法，以使全组工人行动齐一。同时，陈树兰小组对落纱前的准备工作和落纱后的互助检查工作，也非常重视。这些也都是他们降低落纱时间的重要原因。（钱大东）
