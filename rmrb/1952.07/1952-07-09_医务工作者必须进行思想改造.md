The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government
Is about to Lead Medical Personnel in an Ideological Remolding Movement

    To the Editor: We attach great importance to the summary of readers' letters published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 18th and 25th, which exposed medical accidents and the poor work style of medical personnel. The poor work style of many medical personnel urgently needs to be corrected. Currently, we are inspecting and handling these accidents based on the materials exposed by the readers. We thank the readers for their responsible attitude in caring about health work, and we hope that the readers will continue to expose problems in medical work to help us do a good job in health work.
    The People's Daily's brief commentary pointed out that "all medical and health workers must undergo ideological remolding," which is completely correct. On May 16th, we convened representatives from medical administrative departments, medical institutions, pharmaceutical groups, and health departments of major administrative regions in the capital to discuss how to eliminate medical accidents. Everyone unanimously agreed that one of the main reasons for the occurrence of medical accidents is that the ideological work style of medical staff has not been thoroughly reformed. Therefore, to eliminate medical accidents and effectively improve our medical and health work, we must launch an ideological remolding movement for medical staff. After the meeting, we have made some preparations for carrying out the ideological remolding movement for medical personnel. We plan to launch this movement in the capital first, and then extend it to the whole country. We want to educate all medical staff to establish a view and style of serving the people wholeheartedly, and to put into practice Chairman Mao's great call of "healing the wounded, rescuing the dying, and promoting revolutionary humanitarianism."

The National Association of Chinese Nurses and Two Other Organizations
Held a Meeting to Examine Accidents in Nursing Work and Demanded the Rapid Launch of an Ideological Remolding Movement

    To the Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 18th and 25th successively published many readers' letters exposing the irresponsible and poor work style of medical personnel, as well as the serious medical accidents caused by it. These letters have aroused extreme attention in our nursing circles. On June 28th, we specially convened the heads of nursing work from more than 50 public and private hospitals in Beijing to further expose the medical accidents that have occurred in nursing work in various hospitals, and unanimously supported the suggestion put forward in the People's Daily's brief commentary that "all medical and health workers must undergo ideological remolding."
    The accidents in nursing work are quite alarming. According to incomplete statistics, Xiehe Hospital had more than 110 accidents in the first half of this year alone. Although other hospitals do not have statistics, the situation is also very serious. The most common phenomenon is giving patients the wrong medicine or the wrong injection. Some nurses at Xiehe Hospital gave medicine for ear diseases to people with eye diseases, and circumcised children who should not have been circumcised, causing great pain to the patients. Incidents of patients being injured due to poor nursing care have been constantly occurring in North China People's Hospital, Central People's Hospital, and Beijing Municipal First Hospital. Once, a nurse at Beijing Private Children's Hospital (now changed to Municipal) forgot to close the bed railing, and the child fell and had bleeding in the brain. A patient with tuberculous spondylitis in the Central People's Hospital had a wound infection after surgery. After a month, another operation was performed, only to find a piece of forgotten gauze in the wound. Even more serious is the harm to patients' lives due to the negligence of nursing staff. On December 7th of last year, a patient named Yuan Jianping went to the private Beijing Children's Hospital (now changed to Municipal) for treatment. After assistant physician Zhang Wenrui diagnosed him with infectious hepatitis, he decided to inject 10% glucose first. When assistant nurse Liu Guangyun took the medicine, she mistakenly took it as 10% glucose calcium. The doctor did not check it and injected it intravenously, and the patient died in less than five minutes. This is a truly intolerable mistake.
    Some nursing staff treat patients not to restore people's health, but to "practice their skills," treating patients as "experimental products." Not long ago, a nine-month-old child swallowed a screw, which blocked the esophagus and trachea. The child was sent to the Central People's Hospital for treatment. The nurses treated the child as an experimental object, and everyone took turns trying, but not only did they fail to remove the screw, but they also broke the child's throat. This small life was innocently cut short!
    Some nursing staff also have the bourgeoisie's mercenary views. Some nurses in Xiehe Hospital work with the purpose of "making money" and "enjoying themselves." Sometimes when a patient asks a nurse to do something, they say: "I'm about to get off work, let someone else do it!" Or they say: "You are not my patient, I don't care about you." Individual hospitals also retain the bad habit of patients secretly giving "small money" to nursing staff. These all urgently need to be abolished and improved.
    Why are there these bad ideological styles? The basic reason is that some nursing staff have not fully established a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. Therefore, correct criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out, new morals and qualities cannot be established, and old ideas and styles cannot be eliminated. When a nurse at Xiehe Hospital was giving a patient an injection, she found that the needle had forgotten to load the medicine. In order to save her own face, she injected a needle of air into the patient. Chen Zhen was a patient with tuberculous peritonitis and left elbow arthritis. Six needles were broken in his left elbow joint and one needle was broken in his right arm during his long-term treatment in North China People's Hospital and Central People's Hospital, but no one knew about it. Later, it was discovered after the doctor repeatedly took X-rays. As for how the needle breakage accident happened? It has not been investigated until now. Some medical and health personnel, for the sake of their own face, do not care about the life or death of patients, deliberately conceal accidents, and make mistakes again and again. This is such a serious and irresponsible bad style!
    In order to completely prevent and eliminate medical accidents and better protect the people's health, we respond to the call of the Party newspaper and request the relevant health leading organs to quickly launch and lead medical personnel to carry out an in-depth ideological remolding movement. In this movement, all of our nursing staff must unite with all medical workers and thoroughly transform our ideology.

### 医务工作者必须进行思想改造

    医务工作者必须进行思想改造
    中央人民政府卫生部
    即将领导医务人员进行思想改造运动
    编辑同志：我们十分重视六月十八日和二十五日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表的广大读者揭发医疗事故及医务人员不良作风的来信综述。不少医务人员的不良作风是急需纠正的。目前，我们正根据读者所揭发的材料，对这些事故进行检查和处理。我们感谢读者这种关心卫生事业的负责态度，更希望读者继续揭发医务工作中的问题，帮助我们做好卫生工作。
    人民日报简评指出“一切医药卫生工作者必须进行思想改造”，这一意见是完全正确的。五月十六日，我们曾召集首都的医疗行政部门、医疗机构和医药团体以及各大行政区卫生部的代表，座谈如何消除医疗事故的问题。大家一致认为：发生医疗事故的主要原因之一，是医务工作人员的思想作风没有得到彻底的改造。因此，要消除医疗事故，有效地改进我们的医药卫生工作，必须开展一个医务工作人员的思想改造运动。会后，我们对开展医务人员思想改造运动已作了一些准备工作。我们拟于最近先在首都开展这个运动，然后推及全国。我们要教育所有医务工作人员树立全心全意为人民服务的观点和作风，以具体实践毛主席的“救死扶伤，发扬革命人道主义”的伟大号召。中央人民政府卫生部
    中华护士学会总会等三单位
    开会检查护理工作中的事故要求迅速开展思想改造运动
    编辑同志：六月十八日和二十五日人民日报“读者来信专页”先后发表了很多读者来信，揭发医务人员不负责任的恶劣作风，以及因此而造成的严重的医疗事故。这些来信，引起了我们护士界的极端重视。六月二十八日，我们特召集了北京市五十多个公、私立医院的护理工作负责人开会，进一步揭发了各医院在护理工作上所发生的医疗事故，并一致拥护人民日报简评中提出的“一切医药卫生工作者必须进行思想改造”的建议。
    在护理工作方面的事故，是十分惊人的。据不完全统计，协和医院在今年上半年，就发生了一百一十多次事故。其他医院虽无统计，但情况也很严重。最普遍的现象是给病人用错药，打错针。协和医院有的护士把治耳病的药给害眼病的人用了，把不应该割包皮的小孩割了包皮，给病人带来很大痛苦。因护理不周而摔伤病人的事情，在华北人民医院、中央人民医院、北京市立第一医院都不断发生。有一次，北京私立儿童医院护士忘了关上床栏杆，把小孩摔得脑子里出血。中央人民医院一个患结核性脊椎炎的病人，动手术后伤口感染，一个月后又重新开刀，才发现伤口内有一块被遗忘的纱布。更严重的是由于护理人员的疏忽而危害了病人的生命。去年十二月七日，患者袁健平去私立北京儿童医院（现已改为市立）治病，经助理医师张文瑞诊断为传染性肝炎，决定先注射百分之十的葡萄糖。助理护士刘光芸取药时竟错为百分之十的葡萄糖钙。医生没有检查就由静脉注射进去，不到五分钟病人就死了。这真是不可容忍的错误。
    有些护理人员给病人治病，不是为了恢复人民的健康，而是为了“练习技术”，把病人当做“试验品”。不久以前，有一个九个月的小孩，吞了一个螺丝，堵在食道和气管中间。这个孩子被送到中央人民医院去治疗。护士们把这个孩子当作试验对象，你也来一下，他也来一下，不但没有取出螺丝，反而把小孩的喉咙弄破了。这个小生命竟无辜地被断送了！
    某些护理人员还有资产阶级的雇佣观点。协和医院有些护士是抱着“赚钱”“享受”的目的而工作，有时病人要求护士做一件事，他们说：“我快下班了，你让别人做吧！”或者说：“你不是我的病人，我不管你。”个别医院还保留着病人向护理人员私下给“小钱”的不良习气。这些都是急待废除和改进的。
    为什么有这些恶劣的思想作风？基本原因是某些护理人员还没有完全树立为人民服务的革命人生观，因此，正确的批评与自我批评不能开展，新的道德和品质不能建立，旧的思想和作风也就不能清除。协和医院一个护士给病人打针时，发觉针内忘记装药，她为了顾及自己的面子，就把一针空气给病人打进去了。陈真是个患结核性腹膜炎及左肘关节炎的病人，他长期在华北人民医院及中央人民医院治疗期间，左肘关节内断了六根针，右臂内断了一根针，一直没有人知道。后来经医生屡次照X光才发现了。至于断针的事故究竟是怎样发生的？直到现在还没有检查出来。某些医药卫生人员为了自己的面子，竟然不管病人的死活，有意隐瞒事故，一错再错，这是多么严重的不负责的恶劣作风！
    为了彻底防止和消灭医疗事故，更好地保障人民的身体健康，我们响应党报的号召，要求有关卫生领导机关，迅速发起并领导医务人员进行一次深入的思想改造运动。在这一运动中，我们全体护理人员一定要和所有医务工作者团结一致，彻底改造思想。
