    CCP Chou Shui Jiao Village Branch
    Leaders and Mutual Aid Group Members Study Documents and Recognize the Benefits of Mutual Aid
    To the Editor: Recently, Communist Party members, propagandists, and reading group members in our village studied the direction of rural economic development and inspected the mutual aid groups in our village. They discovered that many members of the mutual aid groups did not recognize the benefits of mutual aid. For example, the Bai Qi Shang mutual aid group was nominally mutual aid, but in reality, it was individual farming. The group leader, Bai Qi Shang, was unwilling to lead the mutual aid group because he was afraid of trouble and delays in work. Another example is Cheng Yu Rong, a member of the Shi Bao Ku mutual aid group, who, although participating in the mutual aid group, did not follow the various rules of the group. The group leader, Shi Bao Ku, said, "I can't lead him." If these phenomena are not overcome, the mutual aid groups cannot be consolidated, and the patriotic production increase campaign cannot be carried out effectively. When the village Communist Party branch secretary and the village head saw this situation, they found Comrade Gao Gang's report, the rural propaganda handbook, and
    articles from some newspapers and magazines and organized the masses to study. During the study, everyone was very happy to see a letter from Sang Bu Sheng, a farmer in our village, published in the reader's letters column of the People's Daily on May 13th: "Experience proves that organizing is much better than working alone." Through this living example, everyone enthusiastically launched criticism and self-criticism, and all recognized that mutual aid is better than individual farming. Bai Qi Shang said, "I used to always think about working alone. After this study, I realized the benefits of mutual aid and cleared my mind. I will definitely do a good job in the mutual aid group in the future."

### 中共臭水峧村支部  领导互助组组员学习文件认识了互助的好处

    中共臭水峧村支部
    领导互助组组员学习文件认识了互助的好处
    编辑同志：最近本村共产党党员、宣传员、读报组组员学习了农村经济发展的方向，并对本村各互助组进行了检查，发现许多互助组的组员都没有认识互助的好处。如白起上互助组，形式上是互助，实际是单干。组长白起上不愿意领导互助组，怕麻烦，怕误工。又如石抱库互助组的组员成玉荣，虽然参加了互助组，却根本不遵守组内各种制度，组长石抱库说：“咱也领导不了他。”这些现象如果不加以克服，互助组便不能巩固，爱国增产运动也不能很好开展。这村共产党支部书记和村长看到这种情况，便找出了高岗同志的报告，农村宣传手册和
    一些报纸杂志上的文章，组织群众进行学习。在学习中，大家看到五月十三日人民日报读者来信栏刊登的本村农民桑步升的一封来信：“经验证明组织起来比单干好得多”，非常高兴，通过这件活人活事，大家热烈地展开了批评和自我批评，都认识到了互助比单干好。白起上说：“我以前老想着单干，经过这次学习，认识了互助的好处，打通思想了，今后一定要搞好互助组。”
