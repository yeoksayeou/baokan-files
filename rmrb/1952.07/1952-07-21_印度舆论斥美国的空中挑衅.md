Xinhua News Agency, July 20th:

Indian newspaper commentary continues to express dissatisfaction and opposition to the US's adventurous policy of constantly engaging in aerial provocations during the administrative meetings of both delegations at the Korean armistice negotiations, deliberately delaying the negotiations. The "Hindustan Times" published a commentary on July 15th regarding the recent serious provocations by the US Air Force in barbarously bombing the Korean rear and invading China's Northeast airspace, pointing out that the US's adventurous policy of attempting to influence negotiations with bombing "is actually playing with fire," and "it will only arouse anger and hatred." The report stated: "If the bombing is to promote the Korean armistice, it is likely to have the opposite effect—creating a larger-scale conflict."

The "Bombay Chronicle" pointed out in its July 9th commentary that the bombing site was "very close" to the Panmunjom negotiation site, "What possible target could there be, important enough for the US to need to bomb so close to the negotiation site? Why at that particular time?" The report stated: "The choice of target and the timing of the air raid naturally lead to strong suspicions that General Clark and the UN Command are engaging in provocative acts that could cause the armistice efforts to fail."

The Lucknow "National Herald" commented on July 5th that: "The foolishly provocative nature of the bombing of the Yalu River has deeply alarmed public opinion in India and other countries." A commentary in the "Amrita Bazar Patrika" stated: "Although the overwhelming majority of international public opinion disagrees with or even condemns the actions of the United States, US planes have again bombed the Yalu River power plants." The report pointed out that the US's behavior is war gambling, and said: If these provocative actions cause the armistice negotiations to break down, the United States should bear full responsibility.

    印度舆论斥美国的空中挑衅
    【新华社二十日讯】印度报纸舆论对于美国在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团举行行政性会议期间不断进行空中挑衅，蓄意拖延谈判的冒险政策，继续表示不满和反对。 “印度斯坦时报”七月十五日就最近美国空军野蛮轰炸朝鲜后方并侵犯我国东北领空的严重挑衅行为，发表评论指出，美国企图以轰炸来影响谈判的冒险政策，“其实是在玩火”，“它只会引起愤怒和憎恨而已”。该报说：“如果轰炸是为了促成朝鲜停战的话，那很可能已引起相反的效果——造成规模更大的冲突”。
    “孟买纪事报”在七月九日的评论中指出轰炸地点离板门店谈判会址“近在咫尺”，“究竟可能有什么目标，其重要程度使美国需要空袭离谈判会址这样近的地方呢？为什么又刚好在那个时候呢？”该报说：“目标的选择和空袭的时间自然使人十分怀疑，克拉克将军和联合国军司令部的目的是不是在进行挑衅行为，以致可能使停战努力归于失败。”
    勒克瑙“国民先驱报”七月五日的评论说：美国对鸭绿江的“轰炸所含的愚蠢的挑衅性质已深深引起了印度以及其他国家的舆论的不安”。“甘露市场报”的评论称：“虽然占压倒多数的国际公众都不同意甚至指责美国的行为，但是美国飞机却又轰炸了鸭绿江发电厂。”该报指出美国的行为是战争赌博，并说：假使这种挑衅行为引起停战谈判破裂的话，美国应负全部责任。
