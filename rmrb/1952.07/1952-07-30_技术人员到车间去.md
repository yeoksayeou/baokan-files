    The administrative conference of the Beijing Machine Factory decided that technicians should go to the workshop, and the workers of the entire factory were particularly excited about this decision. This is a very important event for the Beijing Machine Factory! Recently, in preparing for the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, the workers of the entire factory made two requests to the leadership: first, to ensure the timely supply of raw materials; second, to ensure that drawings are not made incorrectly. Without discussing the first point, the second point prominently reflects the problem of the factory's technicians being detached from reality and the masses. In recent years, almost every product in the factory has been reworked due to drawing errors, and some errors have even been repeated several times. For example, for the cement mixers manufactured in five batches, the drawings for each batch omitted shaft collars, screws, and bearing pads, so production had to be stopped each time to wait for the parts to be delivered. Although errors are sometimes unavoidable when production tasks are urgent, technical modification notices often do not reach the workshop early enough, and some finished products are even found to have errors after they have been put into storage, making timely correction impossible. For example, two completed bullhead planers that had been trial-produced were already packed when it was discovered that the bullhead tool holder was too large and the body clearance was too narrow to rotate, so they had to be disassembled and corrected. There were also cases where technical modification notices had reached the workshop, but the material analysis tables were delayed. For example, for parts such as the bullhead planer's set screws and shaft covers, some had been canceled or added in the technical notices, but the material analysis tables and operating procedures had not been changed, resulting in repeated errors. In addition, incorrect estimations of work and reversed processes resulted in significant waste of work hours. For example, the bullhead planer's connecting rods 6118 and 6119 and two eyes should have been done by fitters, but the process was arranged in the machine shop; the eyes of the casting machine cutter shaft are very precise and should have been done by the machine shop, but the process was arranged in the fitter's shop, and the holes drilled by the fitters were irregular and had to be transferred to the machine shop for drilling.
    If technicians do not go to the workshop, they will not discover these problems, let alone see the creative inventions and technical improvements of the workers. Whenever workers make inventions, they often say with a contemptuous attitude, "It's already in the books!" Du Rulin, the factory's engineer and head of the technical section, even said, "Technicians are the brains, and workers are the hands and feet!" Therefore, although some technicians occasionally go to the workshop, they do not humbly study technology with the workers, but one-sidedly and dogmatically "guide" the workers with books. Last year, after the air compressor was manufactured, it was discovered that the cylinder was leaking oil. The workers suggested adding a steadying nail to the expanding ring to prevent oil leakage, but engineer Xie Bing ignored the workers' opinions and stubbornly repaired it three times, all of which failed. Finally, it was repaired according to the workers' method, but the time was delayed by half a year, exceeding the delivery deadline on the contract, and a fine of 40 million yuan was imposed.
    These painful lessons did not make the technicians realize the serious shortcomings that existed within themselves. Du Rulin said, "I have already considered going down to the workshop, but the question is whether the workers can accept the guidance of the technicians after going down? Therefore, my opinion is that the workers should be trained first!" But on the contrary, Liang Zhenshi, Zhang Yinjiang, Liu Qixing and others, interns from Yenching University in the factory, experienced firsthand from nearly a year of workshop life that "what should be trained first is not the workers, but the technicians themselves." Over the past year, because they were willing to humbly learn from the workers, they made great progress and achieved remarkable results. Over the past year, Liang Zhenshi has worked closely with the workers to create special tools such as the beveling machine and the gear grinding machine; Zhang Yinjiang helped Yu Fengzhao, a worker in the tool class, to implement high-speed cutting, greatly improving production efficiency; Liu Qixing helped the bullhead planer group improve the light cutter, increasing work efficiency by more than 30 times. Among the old technicians, there are also some young and more enlightened people who have solved difficult problems and experienced the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience because they are willing to humbly learn from the workers. For example, when technician Wang Yingmou was trial-producing the first herringbone gear guillotine last year, he encountered great technical difficulties, so he invited experienced machinists, fitters, and the workshop layout group leader to study together, and as a result, the difficulties were solved. Another example is technician Li Changfu, who, in the urgent task of manufacturing the Huangyang gate hoist, although there were many errors in the drawings due to the relatively hasty design, he was able to go deep into the workshop, accept the workers' suggestions in a timely manner, and correct the errors, and finally completed the task on time.
    On the other hand, the workers urgently need the guidance and help of technicians so that their wisdom and experience can be brought into play. When the reporter visited Cao Wensen, the leader of the scraping group in the fitter's section, he guided him with great interest to visit the triangular special tool he created for measuring the cross tool holder of the bullhead planer; but when he turned around, he sighed infinitely and said, "Unfortunately, the old society did not leave us the opportunity to learn culture. Although this tool has played a great role in production, I can't explain its principles!" Although many workers can find tricks in operation, they cannot find someone to draw diagrams, let alone someone to summarize their experience in a timely manner. Liu Yongshun, a worker in the odd job group of the machine shop, spent a lot of effort to find the trick of automatic tool retraction and tool change for multi-tool and multi-blade cutting, but he could not find someone to draw diagrams for more than a month. The workers' demand for learning technical theory and mastering advanced technology is very urgent, especially the old workers. They are limited by culture and not only require learning advanced technology but also require help in summarizing their experience so that their technical level can be rapidly improved.
    Therefore, the administrative side of the machine factory decided to send technicians to the workshop, which was warmly welcomed by the workers of the whole factory. This has a decisive effect on the work of technicians and workers. Now the administrative leaders of the machine factory have seriously studied the issue of technicians going to the workshop, and have convened meetings and made decisions. Technicians have begun to go to the workshop. Du Rulin, the head of the technical section, in addition to paying attention to assigning technicians to the workshop to help with work, has also begun to pay attention to the workers' rationalization proposals. He said: "Rationalization proposals will come to me, and I guarantee to talk to the person within two days, and there will be results within five days."

### 技术人员到车间去

    技术人员到车间去
    新华社记者  张瑾
    北京机器厂行政会议决定技术人员到车间去，全厂的工人对这个决定感到特别兴奋。这在北京机器厂是一件非常重要的大事！最近，全厂工人在准备爱国增产节约大竞赛中，曾向领导方面提出两个要求：第一、保证原料及时供应；第二、保证不绘错图。第一条且不谈，第二条却把厂里技术人员脱离实际、脱离群众的问题，突出地反映出来了。几年来厂里所有产品几乎没有一种不因绘图错误而返工的，其中有些错误甚至是一错再错地重复好几次。例如分五批制造的洋灰搅拌机，图纸上每批都漏绘了轴箍、螺丝和轴承垫，因此每次装配时都得停工待配零件。虽然，有时生产任务紧急，难免发生错误，但修改错误的技术通知却往往不能尽早到达车间，甚至有些成品已经入了库才发现错误，不能及时纠正。例如试制完工的两部牛头刨已经包装入箱，才发现牛头刀架太大，大身空档太窄，不能回转，只得重新拆卸修正。也有这样的情形：修改错误的技术通知虽已到达车间，但工料分析表却迟迟不到。如牛头刨的顶丝、轴盖等零件，有些在技术通知中已经取消或增添了，而工料分析表与操作程序仍未更改，以致形成一错再错。此外由于估工不正确和工序倒置等形成了工时的很大浪费。例如牛头刨的六一一八、六一一九连杆和两个眼，本应让钳工去做，工序却排列在机工部；铸板机割刀轴的眼是很精密的东西，应该由机工部去做，工序却排列到钳工部，钳工钻的眼不规矩，只得再转到机工部去钻。
    技术人员不到车间去，就不会发现这些问题，更看不到工人群众的创造发明和技术改进。每当工人们有所创造时，他们常常以轻蔑的态度说：“书本上早有了！”机器厂工程师兼技术科长杜汝霖甚至这样说：“技术人员是头脑，工人是手脚！”因此有些技术人员虽然也偶尔走到车间，却不能虚心地和工人们一道钻研技术，而是片面地教条式地用书本“指导”工人。去年，空气压缩机制成后，发现汽缸漏油，工人建议在涨圈上增加一个稳钉，就可不漏油；但工程师谢冰却不理睬工人们的意见，而固执己见地修理了三次，都告失败，最后还是按照工人的办法才修理好了，但时间拖长半年，超过合同上的交货限期，被罚款四千万元。
    这些痛切的教训，并没有使技术人员认识其自身所存在的严重缺点，杜汝霖说：“下车间我也早已考虑到，问题是下去后工人们能否接受技术人员的指导？因此，我的意见是应先将工人训练一下！”但与此相反，燕京大学到该厂的实习生梁枕石、张吟江、刘起兴等，从将近一年的车间生活中却切身体验到：“首先应该训练的不是工人，而是技术人员自己。”一年来，他们因为肯虚心向工人学习，他们就得到很大进步，并且做出很显著的成绩。一年来，梁枕石和工人亲密合作，创造了牙轮倒角机、牙轮研磨机等专用工具；张吟江帮助工具班工人于丰沼实行高速切削，使生产效率大大提高；刘起兴帮助牛头刨组改进光刀，使工作效率提高三十多倍。旧有技术人员中也有一些年青的、觉悟较高的人，因为肯虚心向工人学习，因此解决了困难问题，体验到理论知识和实际经验结合的重要性。如技术员王应谋在去年试制第一部人字牙铡齿机时，技术上遇到了很大困难，他便邀请有经验的机工、钳工和车间划线组长来共同研究，结果解决了困难。又如技术员李长富，在制造黄杨闸启闭机的紧急任务中，虽因设计比较仓促，图样中有不少错误，但由于他能够深入车间，及时接受工人建议，纠正错误，终于按时完成了任务。
    另一方面，工人们迫切要求得到技术人员的指导和帮助，使他们的智慧和经验能够得到发扬。记者访问钳工部刮研小组长曹文森时，他怀着极大的兴致引导着参观他所创造的测量牛头刨横刀架的三角专用工具；但他回过头来又是无限的叹息说：“可惜的是旧社会没有留给咱们学习文化的机会，这种工具虽对生产起了很大作用，但说不出它的道理来！”许多工人在操作中虽能找到窍门，却找不到人绘图，更没有人将他们的经验及时地加以总结。机工部零活组工人刘永顺，费尽心血找到了多刀多刃切削的自动退刀换作法窍门，但一个多月找不到绘图的人。工人们学习技术理论，掌握先进技术的要求是非常迫切的，特别是老工人，他们受着文化的限制，不仅要求学习先进技术，而且要求帮助总结他们的经验，以便使自己的技术水平迅速提高。
    因此，机器厂行政方面决定技术人员到车间去，受到全厂工人的热烈欢迎。这对于工作，技术人员和工人都有着决定性的作用。现在机器厂的行政领导方面已认真研究了技术人员下车间的问题，并召集会议，作出了决定。技术人员已开始走向车间。技术科长杜汝霖，除已注意分派技术员下车间帮助工作外，对工人们的合理化建议也已开始重视，他表示：“合理化建议到我这里，保证两天内找本人谈一次话，五天内要有结果”。
