Victorious Completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the massive Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, originally planned to be completed in ninety days, was completed in just seventy-five days thanks to the active efforts of 300,000 military personnel and civilian laborers. This is the floodgate at Taipingkou, 1,054 meters long with 54 openings, the first large water gate in our country. (Photo by Huang Honghui, People's Pictorial)

To celebrate the early completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Headquarters held grand completion ceremonies at the floodgate and the control gate on June 20th and 21st, respectively. This is a group of representatives from the People's Liberation Army who participated in the completion ceremony at the floodgate. They actively participated in the construction of this massive project and gloriously completed their tasks ahead of schedule. (Photo by Huang Honghui, People's Pictorial)

During the construction of the great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people – the brave and hardworking commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army – confidently undertook the most important and meticulous task of excavating the bottom plate of the control gate. They worked selflessly under the scorching sun. (Contribution from Hubei Daily)

After the entire construction of the floodgate was completed, workers began to test the gate's openings. (Photo by Huang Honghui, People's Pictorial)

As the floodgate construction project neared completion, workers carefully inspected the work and applied cement. The workers said: "We must build the water gate to be both strong and beautiful." (Photo by Huang Honghui, People's Pictorial)

During the construction of the great project, workers universally launched labor competitions, ensuring the early completion of the entire project. This is the leader of the pneumatic riveting team, Sun Daxi, carefully inspecting the rivets. (Photo by Huang Honghui, People's Pictorial)
