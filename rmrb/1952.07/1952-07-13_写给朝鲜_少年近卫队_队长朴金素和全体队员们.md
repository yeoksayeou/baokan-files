To Park Jin-so, Captain of the Korean "Young Guard," and All Members:

Dear Park Jin-so, Captain of the Korean "Young Guard," and all members,

    On June 24th, our homeroom teacher, Lou Yunhai, read us the story of your heroic struggle against the American invaders. Everyone listened quietly, and we were so moved by your heroic deeds that tears streamed down our faces.

    Dear Comrade Park Jin-so, when the Korean People's Army temporarily withdrew and darkness temporarily enveloped your city, you bravely stood up, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and found the brave people in the countryside—the underground guerrillas of the Labor Party. Under their instructions and with their help, you formed the "Young Guard" and began your fighting life. You mobilized and united the children, refused to accept fascist ideological education, sabotaged the enemy's communications, seized the enemy's weapons, and rescued the Korean men and women imprisoned by the enemy... When the People's Army counterattacked, you hid in the bushes and shot at them with the enemy's guns; after the victory, you hung the Young Pioneers flag on the belfry, so that it could fly again in the sky of your own country. These heroic actions are all imprinted in our hearts.

    We are a group of happy Chinese children living in the era of Mao Zedong. Here, the people of the motherland regard us as "flowers" and patiently nurture and educate us. Everything makes us free, happy, and joyful. However, our efforts in learning are not enough, and compared to you, they seem even more insufficient. In the future, we will devote ourselves to learning with your fighting spirit, strengthen our bodies, learn our skills well, and be ready at all times to fight for the motherland and for the cause of world peace.

    Respected members of the Korean "Young Guard," let us unite more closely, learn from and help each other, and fight to the end for the happiness of the children of China and Korea and the whole world!

    All the students of Class B, Fifth Grade, First Elementary School, Zhongmu County, Henan Province

### 写给朝鲜“少年近卫队”队长朴金素和全体队员们

    写给朝鲜“少年近卫队”队长朴金素和全体队员们亲爱的朝鲜“少年近卫队”队长朴金素和全体队员们：
    六月二十四日，我们级任老师娄云海给我们读了你们和美国侵略者进行英勇斗争的故事。大家静静地听着，为你们英勇斗争的事迹，感动得不时淌下眼泪来。
    亲爱的朴金素同志，当朝鲜人民军暂时撤离、黑暗暂时笼罩着你的城市的时候，你勇敢地站立起来，克服各种困难，到乡下找着勇敢的人们——劳动党的地下游击队，并在他们的指示和帮助下，组成“少年近卫队”，开始了战斗生活。你们发动并团结了孩子们，拒绝接受法西斯主义的思想教育，破坏敌人的通讯连络，夺取敌人的武器，救出了被敌人囚禁的朝鲜男女……。人民军反攻的时候，你们隐藏在灌木树林里用敌人的枪射杀它们；胜利了，你们把少先队的旗子挂在警钟楼上，使它重新飘扬在自己祖国的天空。这些英勇的行动，都刻印在我们的心灵里了。
    我们是一群生活在毛泽东时代幸福的中国孩子。在这里，祖国人民把我们看做“花朵”，耐心地培养和教育着我们，一切的一切，都使我们自由、幸福和愉快。但是，我们在学习上的努力还不够，和你们比较起来，显得更不够。今后，我们要以你们的战斗精神投入学习，炼好身体，学好本领，时刻准备着为祖国，为世界和平的事业而奋斗。
    敬爱的朝鲜“少年近卫队”队员们，让我们更紧密地团结起来，互相学习和帮助，为着中朝两国和全世界孩子们的幸福斗争到底！
    河南省中牟县第一小学校五年级乙班全体同学
