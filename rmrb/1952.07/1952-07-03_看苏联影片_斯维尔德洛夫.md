Watching the Soviet Film "Sverdlov"
He Luo

The Soviet film "Sverdlov" is an excellent biographical film that won the second prize of the Stalin Prize in 1941. It not only provides us with a brilliant example of a Bolshevik, but also shows the true scene of the Russian Revolution. The protagonist, Yakov Sverdlov, was one of the leaders of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet regime, and a close comrade of Lenin and Stalin. Although he lived only a short 34 years, his contribution to the Party and the revolutionary cause was enormous. In more than ten years of political life, this talented organizer, propagandist, and agitator fought day and night, traveled all over the Urals, suffered imprisonment and exile, and even when he was critically ill and about to stop breathing, he was still tirelessly planning the work of the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in the Kremlin.

The film vividly demonstrates Sverdlov's lofty revolutionary qualities and high degree of struggle art, as well as his brave, witty character and style. From the very first shots, we can see these characteristics and the historical and social background of his activities: At the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers, there is a city famous for its crafts and commerce, Nizhny Novgorod, whose so-called prosperity is畸形. On the one hand, there is the luxury of the rich, and on the other hand, the hunger of the poor. In the noisy and playful game arena, one can also find the footprints of British and French merchants who monopolize the economic lifeline of Tsarist Russia. It was here that the young Sverdlov appeared as a proletarian fighter. He walked on the bustling market not for leisure, but for a major purpose. He found Gorky and discussed with him the issue of purchasing a printing press urgently needed for the revolution. Secret agents tracked him, and the gendarmerie surrounded and arrested him, but he cleverly evaded them all. When the moon was hazy, the music was melodious, Sverdlov and the worker Trofimoff sent the printing press by boat to the workers in Sormovo, a song expressed his spirit and will as a young revolutionary. They sang:

Suddenly the earth thundered, shaking the steep riverside, Yemelyan Pugachev, led the peasants to rise up, The people of the Don River are very active, with strong soldiers and high morale, The heroes of Zhiguli gathered, a banquet to welcome victory!

Listen, what a magnificent song! It will inspire the fighting people! And make those bloodsuckers tremble!

Due to his clear understanding of the situation and the tasks of the Party, and due to his outstanding efforts and contributions, Sverdlov quickly became an important figure in the Party. After arriving in Yekaterinburg, the heart of the Urals, he launched a great revolutionary activity. Under the strong pressure of the people, the Tsar had to temporarily create a smokescreen of "democracy," and on October 17th, he issued a declaration promising the people "the unwavering principles of guaranteeing civil liberties: effectively guaranteeing the inviolability of personal bodies, freedom of belief, speech, assembly, and association." And those Socialist-Revolutionary gentlemen also seemed to have something to do, but in fact they were just the best vases to decorate these beautiful words. As Sverdlov said, "The people are not stupid, they are much smarter than the Tsar." At the All-Russian Socialist Party Joint Congress, Sverdlov appeared on the podium with the posture of a revolutionary eagle, sharply exposing the true face of the Tsar deceiving the people. He said: "The Tsar knows how to save money, promising the people a lot of freedom, but only using a piece of paper when issuing the declaration. We are even more economical, we tell the Tsar that it is not worth wasting a piece of paper for this useless declaration." "Yes, yes!" A tide of angry shouts rang out from the worker masses, and the broad masses united around Sverdlov. The reactionary parties were panicked. Not only that, Sverdlov also knew that in order to fight against the Tsar and against the reactionary parties, the proletariat must also establish a truly working-class party of its own. Sverdlov successfully completed the great task of building the Party, and with the help of the worker cadres Trofimoff and Azim, whom he personally cultivated, he trained a group of backbones for armed uprisings.

However, the Tsar was not sleeping. In the face of the strong power of the people and the Party's influence and activities becoming more and more widespread and in-depth, how could he sleep! So we saw the secret agent Kazimir, who had been tracking Sverdlov, busy. Due to the betrayal of the traitor, Sverdlov was finally arrested.

The struggle is sharp, but the sharper the struggle, the more it can temper the will of revolutionaries. The torment of prison and the isolation of exile could not sever Sverdlov's connection with the revolution. Throughout his imprisonment, he helped fellow inmates strengthen their studies, used revolutionary poems to encourage everyone's fighting spirit, and fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of optimism in life. Especially when he was with Stalin in the Monastyr exile in Siberia, he was the happiest. They talked and laughed, discussed, or wrote letters to Lenin, and often recited such verses: "Everyone should have a heart of steel, and if they can do it, even if they go to war unarmed, they will not be afraid at all." There were many such hearts of steel in Russia at that time. The October Revolution soon arrived, and it was with such hearts that the Tsar's rule was smashed to pieces. After Sverdlov was freed, he began the work of building political power. In his position as Chairman of the First Central Executive Committee of the Soviet, he formulated and promulgated various laws protecting the rights of the people, ordered the dissolution of the "Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik Constituent Assembly," and dealt with various complicated problems every day. He also personally went to Nizhny Novgorod, removed Mironov, who was causing independence, and reorganized the entire state committee.

Sverdlov was infinitely loyal to the Party and the revolution. He had clear love and hate, and a firm stand. How heartbroken he was when he discovered the traitor! But how intimate and happy he was when his close comrades came to see him, especially how tenacious he was in the struggle against the enemy, and how much and how well he did his work!

Sverdlov was also good at connecting with the masses. He was warm, sincere, modest, simple, and concerned about the interests of the masses, so the masses were happy to approach him and loved him. He helped the worker Trofimoff and others study, took doctors to treat the worker Sukhov, and even when the masses came to the office of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet to talk about felt boots, salted salt, textbooks... he was very welcome. When Azim said to him: "These old people come to the central government for such trivial matters," he replied: "The revolution is for this, the people trust us so they come to us." "It would be terrible if no one came to us. Let them come in quickly." Look, what a strong mass viewpoint!

Sverdlov was also most opposed to disorganization and indiscipline, and he was a model of observing organizational discipline. When he was preparing for the armed uprising and studying street fighting tactics, he appeared entirely as a militiaman. When the worker Trofimoff shouted: "Militiaman Andrei (Andrei is Sverdlov's pseudonym within the Party. – Editor), I order you to come forward and practice live ammunition shooting," he replied, "Yes, Comrade Captain," "Executing your order, Militiaman Andrei arrives." At the same time, he stepped forward in a marching pace, without the slightest sloppiness! What a serious attitude.

However, in contrast to this, we also see Mironov, an intellectual. He was initially influenced by Sverdlov and also had "revolutionary" enthusiasm, but later became a Trotskyist and a local political "earth emperor," and shot Trofimoff, an excellent worker cadre. Why is this? In fact, Mironov's turn to reaction was by no means accidental. He came from a wealthy family, looked down on workers with low culture, and although he could write a few bad poems like "Clouds are thick, rain is coming, lightning is flashing, rain is coming" and also participated in the revolutionary struggle, but as he said to his lover, it was just "not wanting to live a mediocre life." Therefore, he finally wavered, betrayed, and his body was destroyed and his name ruined.

The film "Sverdlov" is of no small educational significance for Party members, especially intellectual Party members. After participating in the celebration of the 31st anniversary of the Party, seeing the great image of Sverdlov, we feel even more intimate and valuable. (Attached picture)

    看苏联影片“斯维尔德洛夫”
    何洛
    苏联电影“斯维尔德洛夫”，是一部荣获一九四一年斯大林奖金二等奖的优秀的传记片。它不仅给我们提供了布尔塞维克的光辉范例，而且也显示出俄国革命的真实情景。主人公雅阔夫·斯维尔德洛夫是联共党和苏维埃政权的领导者之一，列宁和斯大林底亲密的战友。虽然他只活了短短的三十四岁，但对党和革命事业的贡献却是异常巨大的。在十几年的政治生活中，这位天才的组织家、宣传、鼓动家曾夜以继日地战斗着，走遍乌拉尔。遭受监禁和流放，直到病势垂危，快要停止呼吸的时候，还孜孜不倦地在克里姆林宫筹划着联共党（布）的第八次代表大会的工作。
    影片鲜明地表现了斯维尔德洛夫的崇高的革命品质和高度的斗争艺术，以及他的勇敢、机智的性格与作风。从最初的几个镜头我们就可以看到他的这些特征及其活动的历史社会背景：在伏尔加河与奥卡河汇合的地方，有一个以工艺和商业著名的都市尼什诺夫哥罗德，它的所谓繁荣是畸形的。一方面是富有者的豪华，另方面是穷苦人的饥饿。而在喧嚣玩乐的游戏场中，还可以发现那垄断帝俄经济命脉的英法商人的足迹。就在这里，青年的斯维尔德洛夫以无产阶级斗士的姿态出现了。他走在热闹的市集上不是为了闲逛，而是有重大目的的，他找到高尔基，便和他商量购买革命所急需的印刷机的问题。暗探追踪他，宪警围捕他，但全被他巧妙地躲过了。当月色朦胧，琴声悠扬，斯维尔德洛夫和工人特洛菲冒夫把印刷机用船送往索尔莫夫的工人那里去时，一曲引吭高歌，更表露出他那青年革命家的气概和意志。他们唱道：
    忽然大地雷声起，震动了险峻河边地，耶米里扬布卡乔夫，率领农民起了义，顿河的人大活跃，兵强马壮士气高，日古莱地方群英会，大摆酒筵迎胜利！
    请听，这是多么雄伟的歌声！它将给战斗的人们以激励！而使那些吸血鬼发抖！
    由于他对时局和党的任务有明确的了解，由于他的卓越的努力和贡献，斯维尔德洛夫很快便成为党的重要人物。他来到乌拉尔底心脏区卡塞琳堡后，展开了巨大的革命活动。在人民强力的逼迫之下，沙皇也不能不暂时来一个“民主”的烟幕，在十月十七日颁布了宣言，宣言上向人民答应“保证公民自由的坚固不移的原则：切实保障个人身体不可侵犯，信仰、言论、集会和结社自由。”而那些社会革命党的老爷们呢，也好像有事可作了，其实他们不过是装饰这些漂亮词句的最好的花瓶。正如斯维尔德洛夫所说“人民呢并不傻，他们比起沙皇来要聪明得多”。在全俄社会主义各党派联合大会上，斯维尔德洛夫以革命者的雄鹰的姿态出现在主席台上，尖锐地揭穿了沙皇欺骗人民的真实面目，他说：“沙皇是很知道节省的，答应人民好多自由，但是发表宣言的时候，只用一张纸。我们呢更节省，我们告诉沙皇，为这种没用的宣言浪费一张纸也犯不上。”“对呀，对呀！”从工人群众那里响起了怒潮般的喊声，广大群众团结在斯维尔德洛夫的周围来了。反动的各党派惊慌失措。不仅如此，斯维尔德洛夫更知道要与沙皇斗争，与各反动党派斗争，无产阶级还必须建立一个真正工人阶级自己的政党。斯维尔德洛夫又胜利地完成了建党的伟大任务，同时并在他亲手培养出来的工人干部特洛菲冒夫、阿吉姆等协助之下，训练了一批武装起义的骨干。
    然而，沙皇并没有睡觉，他在人民强大的力量面前，在党的影响及其活动一天天更加普遍深入的时候，怎么能够睡得着呢！于是我们看到那一直跟踪着斯维尔德洛夫的暗探卡吉密尔忙碌起来了。由于内奸的告密，斯维尔德洛夫终于被捕。
    斗争是尖锐的，但斗争愈尖锐，愈能锻炼革命者的意志。监狱的折磨，放逐的隔离，都不能割断斯维尔德洛夫与革命的联系。在整个囚禁的期间，他帮助难友加强学习；用革命的诗句来鼓舞大家的斗志，在生活上也充分表现了革命的乐观主义精神。特别是他在西伯利亚蒙纳斯德尔流放地和斯大林在
    一起的时候，他最愉快。他们谈笑着、讨论着，或给列宁写信，并常常背诵着这样的诗句：“每个人都应有一颗钢铁的心，能做到的话，即便是手无寸铁去打仗，他也一点都不害怕。”这样的钢铁的心在当时的俄国是不少的。十月革命不久到来了，就靠这样的心把沙皇的统治打得粉碎。斯维尔德洛夫获得自由后，便开始了建政工作。他在苏维埃第一任中央执行委员会主席的岗位上，制订和颁布了各种保护人民权利的法律；下令解散了“社会革命党——孟什维克立宪会议”；每天处理各种头绪纷繁的问题。他并亲自去到尼什诺夫哥罗德，撤掉了那个闹独立性的米洛诺夫的职位，并改组整个州委会。
    斯维尔德洛夫对党对革命是无限忠诚的，他爱憎分明，立场坚定。当他发现内奸的时候是怎样的痛心啊！但在亲密的战友来见他时，他又是多么的亲昵和高兴，特别是他对敌人的斗争是那样顽强，他的工作作得又多又好！
    斯维尔德洛夫又是善于联系群众的。他热情，诚恳，虚心，朴素，关心群众的利益，因此，群众都很乐于接近他，爱戴他。他帮助工人特洛菲冒夫等学习，带医生去给工人苏霍夫治病，就是群众找到苏维埃中央执行委员会的办公室来谈毡靴，咸盐，教科书……他也是很欢迎的。当阿吉姆向他说：“这些老百姓豆大个事也来找中央”的时候，他答：“革命就为这个，老百姓相信我们才找我们。”“要谁都不找我们那就糟啦。你快让他们进来。”请看，这是多么强的群众观点！
    斯维尔德洛夫还最反对无组织无纪律，他正是遵守组织纪律的模范。在他准备武装起义，研究巷战战术的时候，他就完全以一个民兵的身份出现。当工人特洛菲冒夫喊道：“民兵安得烈（安得烈是斯维尔德洛夫在党内的化名。——编者），命令你到前边来，练习实弹射击”，他答“是，队长同志”，“执行你的命令，民兵安得烈到”。同时正步向前，丝毫不苟！这又是何等严肃的态度。
    然而与此对照，我们还看到另外一个知识分子出身的米洛诺夫。他最初受斯维尔德洛夫的影响，也有“革命”的热情，但后来却成为托洛斯基分子，和地方政权的“土皇上”，枪杀了优秀的工人出身的干部特洛菲冒夫。这是为什么呢？其实，米洛诺夫之走向反动，决不是偶然的。他出身富贵人家，瞧不起文化低的工人，虽然会写几句“乌云密布着，雷雨将到，闪电闪射着，雷雨将到”之类的坏诗而且也参加了革命斗争，但正如他对爱人所说，这只是“不想过庸俗的生活”罢了。因此他终于动摇，叛变，身灭名裂。
    影片“斯维尔德洛夫”对于党员，特别是对知识分子党员的教育意义是不小的。我们在参加了庆祝党的三十一周年纪念会以后，看到斯维尔德洛夫的伟大形象，更觉得亲切，可贵。（附图片）
