    "Stinky Nest" Transformed into a Clean Courtyard
    Comrade Editor: In the past, everyone, young and old, in the Daxin Alley of the Seventh District of Xi'an knew that "Number Six" was a "stinky nest," and anyone who came here had to hold their nose. This courtyard was U-shaped, inhabited by seven households. On both the east and west sides of the gate were large chicken coops, with chicken manure and garbage piles over a foot high under the western chicken coop, and over two feet high under the eastern chicken coop... Not a single place in the courtyard was clean; it was covered in chicken droppings and garbage. In hot weather, the stench was overwhelming, so even the people living at "Number Six" didn't want to cool off in these places. In the overgrown backyard, sewage and dirty things were concentrated, and on windy days, rotten leaves and charcoal ash flew everywhere.

    Under the great call of "Everyone Participate in the Patriotic Health Campaign," and through the publicity and education of the Health Committee, the Health Inspection Team, and the Newspaper Reading Group, the people of "Number Six" recognized the importance of cleanliness and hygiene and understood the benefits of being hygienic. Thus, through their collective labor, the "stinky nest" began to change. People who come here now no longer hold their noses. The former chicken coops and manure piles have all been cleared away, and red and green flowers have been planted where the manure piles used to be, making the courtyard clean. The backyard has also been completely renewed; feces, dirty water, and weeds are gone, and vegetables have been planted on half of the land.

    Today, "Number Six" has been rated as a "model clean courtyard," and all the men, women, and children in the courtyard have developed hygienic habits: frequently washing clothes, quilts, and bathing; not drinking raw water or eating raw or cold food; and covering excrement with ash and soil after defecation. If something is a little unclean, the people in the courtyard will feel extremely uncomfortable; if someone carelessly throws away scraps of paper or fruit peels, they will be reprimanded.

### “臭窝窝”变成了清洁院

    “臭窝窝”变成了清洁院
    编辑同志：从前，西安市七区大新巷的男女老少，都知道“六号”是个“臭窝窝”，谁到了这里都要捏着鼻子。这个院落是个“凹”字形，住有七户人家。大门的东西两边各有一个大鸡窝，西边鸡窝下面的鸡屎垃圾堆有一尺多高，东边鸡窝下面的鸡屎垃圾堆有二尺多高……。院落里没有一块是干净的地方，遍地都是鸡屎和垃圾，在天热的时候臭气扑人，因此就是住在“六号”的人也不想在这些地方乘凉。在长满了荒草的后院里，污水、脏东西都集中到了这里，在有风的日子，烂树叶、炭灰到处飞。
    在“人人都参加爱国卫生运动”的伟大号召下，通过卫生委员会、卫生检查组、读报组的宣传教育，
    “六号”的人们认识了清洁卫生的重要，懂得了讲卫生的好处。于是在他们的集体的劳动下，“臭窝窝”开始变了样。现在来到这里的人们再也不捏着鼻子了。从前的鸡窝与鸡屎堆已全部被他们扫除了，在原有的鸡屎堆的地方种植了红红绿绿的鲜花，院落是洁净的；后院也焕然一新，粪便、脏水和荒草都不见了，半边地上还种上了蔬菜。
    今天的“六号”已被评成“典型清洁院”，全院落的男女老少都养成了卫生习惯：经常洗衣服、洗被子、洗澡；不喝生水、不吃生冷；大便后用灰土盖住。要是什么地方有点不干净，院里的人们就会感到极大的不舒服；如果有人随便抛撒烂纸片或果皮，就会受到别人的责备。黄忠灼
