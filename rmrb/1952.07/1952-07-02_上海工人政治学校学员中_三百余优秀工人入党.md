    Xinhua News Agency report: Over three hundred and eighty outstanding workers from various state-owned and publicly-owned factories studying at the first session of the Shanghai Workers' Political School have gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. On June 25th, an oath-taking ceremony was held for the new Party members, and over six hundred non-Party students were invited to attend. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were also sent to supervise the oath-taking.
    The newly admitted Party members are all outstanding industrial workers who have excelled in production, study, and various movements. Among them, one hundred and seventy-five are members of the New Democratic Youth League; twenty-three are newly promoted worker-cadres since the "Three-Anti" Campaign; and many are model workers and advanced workers. For example, Lu Agou, the newly appointed Deputy Director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, led his team to complete production contracts signed with the administration ahead of schedule four times in a row, saving the country 220 million yuan. Yang Fuxiang, a model worker from the Shanghai No. 2 Branch of the Central Textile Machinery Factory, has improved five types of tools, including an improved iron sheet tool that increased labor efficiency fivefold. Yi Shijuan, an outstanding member of the Youth League from the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, actively studied the Hao Jianxiu work method, reducing roller cotton waste to 0.185 percent, setting a new record for the entire city of Shanghai. Zhou Gentao of the Wusong Gas Company braved the rain to go to the countryside to collect materials on corrupt elements, promoting the "Three-Anti" Campaign throughout the factory.
    The Shanghai Workers' Political School has one thousand and nineteen worker students. After studying documents on communism and the Communist Party, their class consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and they have applied to join the Chinese Communist Party one after another. These new Party members have undergone strict review by Party organizations and have completed the procedures for joining the Party in accordance with the Party Constitution. At the oath-taking ceremony, all new Party members passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市工人政治学校第一期学习的各国营公营工厂的优秀工人，有三百八十五人光荣地参加了中国共产党。六月二十五日举行了新党员入党宣誓仪式，六百多名非党学员被邀参加，中共上海市委员会也派代表到会监誓。
    新入党的学员都是在生产、学习及历次运动中出色的产业工人，其中有一百七十五名是新民主主义青年团团员；二十三名是“三反”运动后新提升的工人干部；还有不少劳动模范和先进工作者。如新任国营上海第二纺织机械厂副厂长陆阿狗，他领导的小组连续四次提前完成和行政签定的生产合同，为国家节省了二亿二千万元。中央纺织机械厂上海第二分厂模范工人杨福祥，曾改进过五种工具，其中改良的铳铁皮工具，就使劳动效率提高了五倍。国营上海第三棉纺织厂优秀团员裔式娟，积极学习郝建秀工作法，使皮辊花减低到百分之零点一八五，创造了上海全市新纪录。吴淞煤气公司周根桃冒雨下乡搜集贪污分子的材料，推动了全厂的“三反”运动。
    上海工人政治学校有一千零十九个工人学员，他们在学习了共产主义与共产党的文件后，阶级觉悟大大提高，纷纷申请加入中国共产党，这些新党员就是经过党组织的严格审查，并按照党章履行入党手续的。在宣誓大会上，全体新党员通过向毛主席的致敬书。
