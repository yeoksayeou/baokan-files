    Time Publishing House Decides to Reduce Book Prices

    Comrade Editor: In the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on June 23rd, a volunteer soldier suggested that "publishing departments should print literary works in pocket editions and sell them to soldiers at low prices." The letter pointed out that the price of our publishing house's recent publication, "Ordinary Soldiers," was too expensive, making it difficult for ordinary soldiers to purchase. We are very grateful for the reader's opinion and offer the following response:

    First, only three thousand copies of the first edition of "Ordinary Soldiers" were printed, and the price was indeed too high (the first edition was priced at 20,600 yuan). The reader's opinion is entirely correct. The first edition is now sold out. Because "Ordinary Soldiers" is a relatively good translated literary work, we must regard distribution as a political task. Therefore, we have decided to reduce the price of the reprint by 20% (i.e., 16,500 yuan, with no reduction in quality) to meet the needs of the general readership.

    Second, in the past, our publishing house published new books in Beijing and Shanghai at relatively high prices, and readers have often reflected on this issue. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, and to reduce the burden on readers, we have decided to generally reduce pricing standards by 10% starting in July. We deeply feel that only by reducing costs and improving quality can we truly be responsible to our readers, and this is the serious work style we should have.

    We hope that readers from all walks of life will continue to supervise and assist us.

    Time Publishing House

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    时代出版社决定减低书价
    编辑同志：六月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表的志愿军读者建议“出版部门把文学作品印成袖珍版廉价售给战士”一信中，指出我社最近出版的“普通一兵”书价太贵，一般战士购买困难，我们十分感谢读者的意见，并作答复如下：
    一、“普通一兵”初版时印了三千册，定价的确太高（初版定价二○、六○○元），读者的意见是完全正确的。现在初版已销完。因为“普通一兵”是一本较好的文艺译品，必须把发行工作看作一种政治任务，所以，我们决定再版时将定价减低二成
    （即一六、五○○元，质量不减），以供应广大读者的需要。
    二、我社过去在北京、上海两地出版新书，定价较高，读者也时有反映，这是一个问题。经过“三反”运动以后，并为了减轻读者负担，我们已决定自七月份起将定价标准普遍降低一成。我们深自觉得只有减低成本，提高质量，才是真正对读者负责，也是应有的严肃的工作作风。
    希望各方面的读者经常给我们督促和协助。
    时代出版社
