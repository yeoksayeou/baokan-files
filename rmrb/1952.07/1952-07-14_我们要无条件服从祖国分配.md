    We Must Unconditionally Obey the Motherland's Assignment
    To the Editors: We, the graduating class of the fourth year of the Department of Law at Peking University, made a firm guarantee to the Party and the motherland before this year's "July 1st": No matter where the motherland assigns us, which department, what position and treatment we are given, we will unhesitatingly respond to the call of the motherland, happily step out of the school gate, and go to where the motherland needs us. In the past, we did have personal plans. Some wanted to become experts, some wanted to stay in Beijing, some wanted to be with their loved ones, and some wanted the salary system. But why do we now resolutely, happily, and unconditionally obey the motherland's assignment?
    Before graduation, we participated in nine months of land reform work. The soaring production enthusiasm of the peasants after the land reform, and the new atmosphere in all aspects, made us deeply aware of the glorious future of the motherland. The changes in our motherland are truly like the spring water rushing forward, advancing rapidly. There are drastic differences in just an hour. Growing up in this great era, growing up in such a heroic country, how selfish and shameful it would be if we only knew how to plan for personal interests!
    Some of us used to think this way: "I am also serving the motherland! But I want to choose my own work, without the need for the Party and the People's Government to worry about it." But the facts prove that the Party and the People's Government are the most loving and caring for our youth. Recently, the "Instructions on Several Issues Concerning the Adjustment of the Work of College Graduates" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government take care of our aspirations and difficulties as much as possible. The Party and the motherland's arrangement for our future will be more far-sighted, more appropriate, and more suitable than our own and our own mothers' arrangements. Precisely because of this, we should obey the motherland's assignment without any worries and unconditionally.
    Students who are about to go to work, let us hand ourselves over to our beloved mother – the motherland and the great Party! For the sake of the motherland's progress, let us listen to all her calls!
    Graduating Class of the Fourth Year of the Department of Law, Peking University

### 我们要无条件服从祖国分配

    我们要无条件服从祖国分配
    编辑同志：我们北京大学法律系四年级的全体毕业同学，曾经在今年“七一”前夕，向党和祖国坚决地提出保证：无论祖国分配我们到那一个地方，那一个部门，给我们什么地位和待遇，我们都毫不犹疑地响应祖国的号召，愉快地跨出校门，到祖国所需要我们的地方去。我们过去不是没有个人打算的，有的想做专家，有的想留在北京，有的想和爱人在一起，有的想薪金制，但是现在我们为什么又坚决地、愉快地、无条件地服从祖国分配呢？
    我们在毕业之前，参加过九个月的土地改革工作，土地改革后农民生产情绪的高涨，和各方面的新气象，使我们深切地认识了祖国的辉煌前途。我们祖国的变化，真像春水奔流一样，一日千里，一小时前后都大不相同。生长在这个伟大的时代，生长在这样英雄的国度里，如果我们只知为个人利益打算，这是多么自私，多么可耻啊！
    我们中间有些同学过去也曾这样想过：“我也为祖国服务啊！但是我要自己来选择自己的工作，用不着党和人民政府操心。”但是事实证明党和人民政府对我们青年是最爱护和最关心的。最近中央人民政府政务院发出的“关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”，对我们的志愿、困难尽可能地照顾。党和祖国对我们前途的安排会比我们自己和我们自己的母亲安排得更有远见、更妥贴、更适当。正因为这样，我们就应该毫无顾虑和无条件地服从祖国的分配。
    行将走上工作岗位的同学们，让我们把自己交给可爱的母亲——祖国和伟大的党吧！为了祖国的前进，让我们听从她的一切号召吧！
    北京大学法律系四年级毕业同学
