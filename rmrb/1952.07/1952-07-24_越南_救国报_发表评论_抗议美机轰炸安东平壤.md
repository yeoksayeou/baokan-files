Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 22nd: The Vietnamese National United Front's organ, "National Salvation Newspaper," recently published a commentary protesting the American imperialist planes' bombing atrocities in Andong, Northeast China. In discussing the barbaric bombing of Andong and the Korean capital, Pyongyang, by American planes, as well as the serious protests lodged by various people's organizations and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China regarding the American planes' violation of Chinese airspace, the "National Salvation Newspaper" wrote: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's protest is also the protest of peace-loving people around the world; peace-loving people around the world clearly recognize the need to be vigilant, to stop the bloody hands of American war instigators, and to actively prepare for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

The "National Salvation Newspaper" pointed out: While American imperialists are wreaking havoc in Andong, Pyongyang, and at the Yalu River power plants, their running dogs, the French aggressors, are also committing inhumane crimes in Vietnam, destroying dikes and other irrigation projects, leaving Vietnamese people destitute and homeless. The Vietnamese people hate the American and French imperialists with gnashing teeth, and they are determined to actively participate in the production increase and conservation competition, continue to eliminate enemy troops, and advance their struggle for national independence and the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

    越南“救国报”发表评论
    抗议美机轰炸安东平壤
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十二日讯：越南国民联合战线机关报“救国报”最近发表评论，抗议美帝国主义飞机轰炸中国东北安东的暴行。“救国报”在谈到美国飞机野蛮轰炸安东和朝鲜首都平壤的暴行、以及中华人民共和国各人民团体和外交部长周恩来对美国飞机侵犯中国领空所提出的严重抗议时写道：周恩来外交部长的抗议，也正是全世界爱好和平的人民的抗议；全世界爱好和平的人民清楚地认识到，有必要提高警觉，制止美国战争挑拨者的血手，并积极筹备亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    “救国报”指出：当美帝国主义者在安东、平壤和鸭绿江发电厂肆虐的时候，他们的走狗法国侵略者也正在越南犯下惨无人道的罪行，毁坏堤闸等灌溉工程，把越南人民弄得家破人亡。越南人民切齿痛恨美法帝国主义者，他们决心积极参加增产节约竞赛，继续消灭敌军，把他们争取民族独立和保卫亚洲与世界和平的斗争向前推进一步。
