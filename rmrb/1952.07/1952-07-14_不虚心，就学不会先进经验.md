　　Wang Changqing, an old driver at the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, is forty years old this year and has been a driver for thirteen years. Although he does his work without cutting corners, he has no creativity and always works according to the old rules.

　　When Zheng Xikun's chartered train group began to exceed the axle load, Wang Changqing always thought it was "risky" and that "overloading" was against the rules. He continued to drive according to the old rules, content with his stagnant thinking that "it's good enough to avoid accidents."

　　After the nationwide railway workers launched the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, the conductors who could exceed the axle load in the past are now exceeding it even more; those who had not exceeded the axle load in the past are now also learning and striving to be able to exceed it. In the face of such a movement, Wang Changqing could no longer stand aloof, but he was still unwilling to humbly learn advanced experience. When he saw others actively seeking out conductors from Zheng Xikun's chartered train group to learn the experience of exceeding the axle load, he thought to himself, "What's there to learn! Zheng Xikun 'raises the handle high and opens the steam valve wide,' while I 'open the steam valve wide and raise the handle high.' It's the same way of working, whether you learn it or not, you can still exceed the axle load."

　　On May 26th, his superiors sent him to pull freight train No. 988 to Lishan. Wang Changqing happily drove the locomotive out of the depot, pulling a total of 4,244 tons of cargo, more than double the quota (the quota was 2,100 tons). He thought, "Good, this time I'll show them what I can do!" And he called the dispatcher to tell him, "I guarantee that the locomotive will have enough water to get to Lishan, and there's no need to take on water at Liaoyang Station."

　　After starting the train, Wang Changqing felt it was very difficult. In each section, he was one or two minutes late. When the train arrived at Liaoyang Station, sixteen tons of the twenty-four tons of water in the tank had already been used. But he thought: from Sujiatun to Liaoyang is 48.7 kilometers, and from Liaoyang to Lishan is 19.7 kilometers. There are still eight tons of water left, which should be enough to get to Lishan. Therefore, he did not stop at Liaoyang Station.

　　After leaving Liaoyang Station, the locomotive ran even slower. Wang Changqing anxiously told the stoker to fill the furnace with coal, but no matter how much coal was added, steam could not be generated. The locomotive ran slower and slower. After reaching Shoushan, there was even less steam, and the locomotive ran even slower. Looking at the water, there were still three tons left. He still felt that there were only nine kilometers left to Lishan, and if he went faster, he might still be able to make it. He told the stoker to burn steam quickly. But no matter how he burned, the steam just wouldn't come up. The locomotive ran another four kilometers, and the water in the tank was exhausted. There was no way but to stop the locomotive on the way, five kilometers away from Lishan. Lishan Station sent a locomotive to pull the train to Lishan.

　　When he arrived in Lishan, Wang Changqing was very distressed, and he, the deputy driver, and the stoker investigated the reason why the water was not enough. They cleaned the boiler and saw that there was too much ash at the bottom of the furnace. With too much ash, the ventilation was poor, and of course, steam could not be generated. It was also discovered that the coal in the furnace was too thick, suppressing the fire.

　　"How did the fire bed in the furnace get suppressed?" Wang Changqing asked.

　　Deputy driver Zhao Wenyuan and stoker Xu Wensheng said, "When the locomotive left the depot, we cleaned the fire bed in the furnace too thinly, so after starting the train in Sujiatun, we had to add more coal. As a result of adding more coal, the fire bed was suppressed, and the ash at the bottom of the furnace also increased, so the ventilation was poor, and it was not easy to generate steam."

　　Wang Changqing thought, "Ah! That's it, when cleaning the furnace at the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, only the deputy driver and the stoker did it. I didn't check it myself, and I didn't look at the thickness of the fire bed. This is because the preparations before departure were not done well."

　　Then he asked, "Since the ash at the bottom of the furnace was accumulating more and more, why didn't you tell me, and we could have stopped at Liaoyang Station to clean the furnace!" The deputy driver and the stoker said, "At that time, we were only concerned about looking at the water in the tank and forgot to clean the furnace, so we didn't tell you about cleaning the furnace." Wang Changqing nodded and said, "Right! At that time, I was only concerned about looking at the water, and I didn't think about cleaning the furnace myself. This is because the communication between the driver and the stoker was not good." In addition, they also found that they should have taken on water at Liaoyang Station and should not have been only focused on speed and forgotten safety.

　　After studying these reasons, Wang Changqing admitted his mistake and said, "We didn't master Zheng Xikun's over-axle, five-hundred-kilometer operation method, and we didn't do a good job of preparing before departure; the communication between the driver and the stoker was not enough on the way; we were only concerned about speed and forgot safety. These are all incompatible with Zheng Xikun's operation method. We must humbly learn in the future!"

　　Since they learned Zheng Xikun's operation method, they have safely exceeded the axle load by more than 7,200 tons in five days.

　　Now, Wang Changqing says to everyone he meets, "If you want to exceed the axle load, you can't do it without learning from others' advanced experience."

    不虚心，就学不会先进经验
    王宝星  吴天瑞
    苏家屯机务段的老司机王长清，今年四十岁，已经作了十三年的司机工作了。他作工作虽不打折扣，但也没啥创造，一向按着老规矩干活。
    郑锡坤包车组开始超轴的时候，王长清总认为那是“冒险”，“多拉”是违反规矩的。他仍然按照老规矩开车，满足于自己“不出事故就好”的故步自封思想。
    全国铁路职工开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动以后，过去能超轴的乘务员，现在还要多超轴；过去没超轴的，现在也在学习，争取能够超轴。在这样一个运动面前，王长清再也不能置身度外了，但是他仍不愿虚心学习先进的经验。他看见别人积极地找郑锡坤包车组的乘务员学习超轴的经验时，心里想：“有啥学的！郑锡坤是‘高提手把大开汽门’，我是‘大开汽门高提手把’，都是一样干法，学不学也一样能超轴。”
    五月二十六日，上级派他拉九八八次货车到立山去。王长清很高兴地驾驶机车出了库，一共拉了四千二百四十四吨货物，超过定数一倍多（定数是两千一百吨）。他想：“好，这回做个样儿给他们看看！”并打电话告诉调度员：“我保证到立山时，机车的水够用，不必在辽阳站上水。”
    开车以后，王长清觉得很费劲。在每个区间，都晚点一两分钟。车到辽阳站时，水柜里装的二十四吨水，已经用去了十六吨。但他想：从苏家屯到辽阳是四十八点七公里，从辽阳到立山是十九点七公里。还有八吨水，到立山可也够用了。所以，没有在辽阳站停车。
    出了辽阳站，机车走得更慢。王长清着急地叫司炉往炉里填煤，可是怎么填煤，也烧不起汽来。机车越走越慢。到首山以后，汽就更少，机车走得更慢了。看了看水，还有三吨。他还觉得：到立山只剩九公里了，快点走，或许还能走到。他叫司炉快烧汽。可是无论怎么烧，汽总不上来。机车又走了四公里，水柜里的水已经枯竭。没有办法，只好让机车在途中停下，距离立山还有五公里。立山站派来机车，才把这列车拉到立山。
    到了立山，王长清非常苦恼，他和副司机和司炉研究水不够用的原因。他们清理了锅炉，看见炉底的灰太多。灰多了不通风，当然烧不起汽来。又发见炉里的煤太厚，把火都压住了。
    “怎么把炉里的火床都压住了呢？”——王长清问。
    副司机赵文元和司炉徐文盛说：“在机车出库的时候，我们把炉里的火床清理得过薄了，所以在苏家屯开车以后，只好多填煤，多填煤的结果，把火床压住了，炉底的灰也增多了，这样就不通风，不容易烧汽。”
    王长清想道：“啊！是了，在苏家屯机务段清炉的时候，光是副司机和司炉干的，自己没检查，也没看看火床厚薄。这是由于出乘前准备工作没做好的缘故。”
    接着他又问道：“既然炉底的灰越积越多，为什么不对我说一声，我们可以在辽阳站停车清炉呀！”副司机和司炉说：“那时候光顾看水柜里的水，忘记清炉了，所以也没和你说清炉的事。”王长清点头说：“对！那时光顾得看水了，自己也没想到清炉的事。这是由于司机司炉间的联系不好的缘故。”此外，他们还发现在辽阳站也应该上水，不应该只顾图快，忘记了安全。
    在研究了这些原因之后，王长清承认错了，他说：“我们没掌握郑锡坤的超轴、五百公里作业法，在出乘前没做好准备工作；在途中司机和司炉联系不够；只顾求快忘记了安全。这都是和郑锡坤的作业法不相容的。咱们以后可得虚心学习了！”
    自从他们学习了郑锡坤的作业法以后，在五天当中，安全地超轴了七千二百多吨。
    现在，王长清逢人就说：“要想超轴，不学习别人的先进经验是不行的。”
