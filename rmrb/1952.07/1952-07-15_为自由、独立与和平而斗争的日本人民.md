The Japanese People Fighting for Freedom, Independence, and Peace
Xu Yumin

I. The Rising Japanese Movement for Peace and Independence

On September 8, 1951, the U.S. government and the Japanese Yoshida government signed the separate "peace treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" in San Francisco. On February 28th of this year, the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," a military agreement specifically implementing the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," was signed. This series of treaties, which violated international agreements, not only fundamentally violated the Japanese people's aspirations for freedom, independence, and peace, but also stipulated that the U.S. occupation forces would continue to occupy Japan for a long time, that the U.S. would have extraterritorial jurisdiction in Japan, and that Japan would have the obligation to assist the U.S. in taking aggressive actions under the guise of the United Nations. As the Japanese Communist Party pointed out on April 28th—the so-called "effective date of the peace treaty"—these treaties brought the Japanese people not peace and independence, but war and humiliation.

In order to implement these traitorous treaties and the U.S. policy of intensifying the revival of Japanese militarism, the Yoshida reactionary government, in addition to proposing a huge military budget in the Diet this year, also drafted a series of fascist bills, attempting to use them to deprive the Japanese people of their various basic rights, suppress their just struggle for freedom, independence, and peace, and turn Japan into a colony of U.S. imperialism.

However, U.S. imperialism and the Yoshida traitorous clique miscalculated. Since last autumn, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the movement of the broad masses of Japanese people for freedom, independence, and peace has been magnificent and has moved toward a new upsurge. The concentrated manifestation of this new upsurge is the large-scale demonstration held by the Japanese people on this year's "May Day."

On "May Day," four million workers, citizens, students, youth, and women across Japan held rallies and demonstrations in more than 480 locations across the country. The slogans "Oppose the rearmament of Japan, strive for national independence!" "Yankee go home!" "We want to defend peace, oppose war!" resounded throughout the Japanese islands and major cities.

The Yoshida reactionary government made prior arrangements to take bloody suppression against these kind Japanese people who demanded peace and independence. Tens of thousands of police were specially deployed around the People's Square in Tokyo. When the marching队伍 arrived, the bloody massacre began. However, the angry people did not succumb to police batons, tear gas, and pistols. They fought the police with their bare hands for more than two hours. The U.S. occupation forces not only directed but also directly participated in the barbaric suppression by the Japanese police. JCP Diet member Hayahisa Hachijuni solemnly pointed out in the Diet on May 6: "The first to open fire was the U.S. military police."

This solemn struggle of the Japanese people showed the world their determination and strength, which greatly shocked the imperialists. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on May 2, people close to the U.S. State Department openly admitted: "The May Day demonstration shows that... the Japanese people have shown their hatred of the West."

The Japanese people, who have suffered from the pain of war, strongly demand peace. Despite the frantic persecution by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, 6.3 million Japanese people have signed the Stockholm Appeal, and 6 million have signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty. Organizations such as the Japan Peace Committee have now issued declarations calling for June 25 to August 15 to be designated as Japan's second peace month, and for peace activities to be carried out throughout the country.

Striving to establish friendly relations with Asian countries and to conduct equal and mutually beneficial trade is another important content of the Japanese people's movement for peace and independence. The Japanese people are well aware that Japan cannot have true independence and a prosperous peaceful life if it cannot get rid of the shackles of U.S. economic enslavement. In this regard, they attach particular importance to developing mutually beneficial trade relations with New China. After Song Qingling, Guo Moruo, and other famous figures in China's peace cause initiated the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference and sent invitations to Japan, Japanese peace-loving人士 such as Hirano Yoshitaro and Yanagida Kenjuro immediately responded and established a preparatory committee, deciding to send Oyama Ikuo, former Vice-President of the Japanese House of Councillors Matsumoto Jiichiro, Yodogawa Steel Works President Uda Koichi, and Sakurazawa Nyoichi as delegates to attend. When the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited Japanese trade union representatives to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" observation ceremony, the Japanese workers showed great enthusiasm and sent a total of 120 representatives. It was only due to the unreasonable obstruction of the Yoshida government that these representatives failed to come to China.

In order to promote peaceful trade with China, the China-Japan Trade Promotion Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association have decided to launch a signature campaign to promote China-Japan trade. The convening of the International Economic Conference and the signing of the China-Japan trade agreement have excited business circles throughout Japan. They are organizing to promote the realization of peaceful trade. The Ishikawa Prefecture Assembly and the City Council convened an "Economic Conference to Open Up the Industrial Crisis" including local groups, capitalists, and trade unions. Business circles in Kansai established the Kansai Japan-China Trade Promotion Association on June 26, deciding to launch a nationwide movement to promote the realization of the China-Japan trade agreement.

Currently, the Japanese people are actively preparing to welcome the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference to be held in Beijing at the end of September.

II. Japanese Workers Standing at the Forefront of the Struggle for Independence and Peace

The struggle of Japanese workers has entered a new stage since last autumn, and the five strikes since April have demonstrated the strong power of Japanese workers.

As early as late October last year, when the Yoshida government forced the Japanese House of Representatives to approve the traitorous treaty, 250,000 Japanese coal miners went on strike for 12 days from October 31. Immediately afterwards, there was a strike by 125,000 electricity workers across Japan. And from late November, headed by the National Railway Workers' Union (with 387,000 members), Japanese workers launched a large-scale year-end struggle. Although this struggle mainly focused on raising wages and issuing year-end allowances, it was a direct blow to U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Korea and the plan to revive Japanese militarism, since military production-related enterprises such as electricity and coal mines participated.

A series of reactionary bills, mainly the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," are intolerable to the Japanese people. According to these fascist bills, the Yoshida reactionary government can declare any people's organization illegal. The Japanese workers, standing at the forefront of the struggle for peace and independence, first took on the task of fighting against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." From April 12 to June 20, Japanese workers launched five national strikes. In these five strikes, the number of participants in the second strike on April 18 exceeded one million, and the other four strikes were all above 400,000 to 500,000. During each strike, a large number of workers, peasants, students, cultural circles, and people from other classes also adopted methods such as rallies, demonstrations, and strikes to support the striking workers. The number of workers supporting the second strike reached 2.4 million.

Although this reactionary bill was amended and passed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries on July 3 in the House of Councillors and on July 4 in the House of Representatives, the JCP Diet caucus has issued a statement calling on the people of the whole country to continue to rise up against this fascist bill.

Japanese workers not only carried out the above-mentioned five major strikes, but also carried out a series of struggles for their survival rights and to improve their living conditions. For example, the Shimonoseki factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is a factory under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military supply department, and workers are forced to repair U.S. military vehicles and weapons such as tanks under bayonets. It is also a prison, and a company of U.S. soldiers stationed in the factory can arbitrarily beat people with oak clubs with five-inch-long iron nails. The workers could no longer bear it. They knew that repairing tanks was to kill more Korean brothers, so they put forward the slogan of not working too much, and constantly carried out collective work stoppages and go-slows. With activists in the workshops as the core, they established an anti-fascist action committee. On May 27, they held the first 24-hour full strike, followed by the second, third, and fourth strikes, stopping the tank repair work. The most recent strike they held on June 2 was extended to 41 hours.

Japanese workers also purged the trade unionist elements in the ranks during the struggle. Mutō Takeo, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union (abbreviated as "Tanrō"), accepted bribes from the Yoshida government and monopoly capitalists on the eve of the April 12 strike and temporarily ordered the "Tanrō" strike to be postponed to April 18. When the news reached the mines, the miners angrily roared: "Expel Mutō! Beat Mutō to death!" As a result, Mutō and the other fourteen members of the Central Struggle Committee who decided to postpone the strike were driven away by the workers at the fourth extraordinary congress of "Tanrō" on April 26, the entire executive department was re-elected, and more progressive elements occupied an overwhelming advantage in the new executive department. It can be believed that Japanese trade unions will be further consolidated and strengthened in the complex struggles in the future, thereby greatly strengthening the strength of the Japanese peace movement.

III. Japanese Peasants Opposing War and Feudal Exploitation

The long-term occupation of Japan by the U.S. military, and the Yoshida government's policy of plundering peasants, which represents the interests of landlords and comprador capital, have made the current situation in rural Japan extremely miserable. Farmers' cultivated land is requisitioned without compensation for U.S. troops and police reserves as military bases; feudal tenancy relations still exist seriously; the government's so-called procurement movement to purchase farmers' grain at low prices deprives farmers of their rations; and the taxes borne by farmers continue to increase. This situation cannot but arouse the resolute resistance of Japanese peasants.

The content of Japanese peasant struggles is diverse. In order to oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by U.S. imperialism and the Yoshida government's policy of expanding armaments, they first carried out struggles against the requisition of land for military bases. The area of land occupied by such bases has now reached 163,000 chōbu (approximately 1 hectare per chōbu). This struggle has now spread throughout the country. Wherever there is a military base, there is a struggle by peasants against the requisition of land. Young poor peasants around the Misawa U.S. Air Force Base in Aomori Prefecture organized a continuing cultivation alliance in the requisitioned land; in the Tama River area of Tokyo, the U.S. military wantonly felled forests to build military bases, causing the river to lose its irrigation function, and the poor peasants around the base organized a "National Independence Sniper Team." Recently, the Yoshida government again provided the area around Mount Fuji, east and north, for the U.S. military to use for exercises, depriving farmers of their ancestral fields and forests. Peasants in ten villages and towns centered on Gotemba in Shizuoka Prefecture, and peasants in the Minamitsuru and Nishiyatsushiro districts of Yamanashi Prefecture, have encountered the same fate. However, the peasants in this area, in order to return Mount Fuji to the Japanese people, organized a self-defense force. Workers also joined the peasants in posting slogans such as "Return our fields" and "Occupation forces get out" in the village. They unanimously shouted the majestic slogan "Mount Fuji is ours!"

The struggle between Japanese peasants and feudal landlords is becoming increasingly sharp. Peasants in a certain village in Kitasaku District, Nagano Prefecture, in order to oppose landlords seizing land and various privileges of feudal landlords, organized a "Land Management Association" with 170 representatives participating to implement self-defense. The struggle of peasants against landlords controlling forests is also unfolding. In the national, public, and private forest areas of Japan, peasants are launching struggles to cut down forests with force. In Minamisaku District, led by Taguchi Village and Kitamaki Village, a forest liberation team was formed with poor peasants, unemployed people, and semi-unemployed people as the core, and began to cut down national forests with force.

Currently, in addition to carrying out struggles against land grabbing (including requisitioning for military bases and landlords forcefully seizing land), opposing grain requisitioning, demanding the opening of forests, and refusing to pay heavy taxes, Japanese peasants are also carrying out a series of struggles against the reactionary agricultural policies of the Yoshida government, such as striving to raise the purchase price of rice, striving to abolish debts, and striving for disaster subsidies.

There are more than one million fishermen in Japan who have made a living by fishing for generations. After the war, the U.S. military demarcated sea areas along the coast as exercise areas, prohibiting fishermen from entering to fish, which forced them to a dead end and they had to rise up to fight. Fishermen in the Kujūkuri Beach area of Chiba Prefecture risked their lives and used misty moments to fish in prohibited areas, forcing the U.S. military to stop target practice. They have now clearly put forward the slogan "Remove the U.S. training grounds, stop building airports for war, and return our fishing grounds." Fishermen centered on Nagasaki and the Gotō Islands (belonging to Kyushu) have risen up since last autumn and finally regained the fishing grounds occupied by the Liberal Party in the area. In the struggle, they put forward the slogan "Down with the Yoshida traitorous government, Americans get out."

IV. Japanese Youth and Students Who Do Not Want to Be Cannon Fodder Anymore

As is well known, one of the main purposes of U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism is to solve the manpower shortage for its wars in Japan. However, today's Japanese youth and students no longer want to be cannon fodder for any war plotters. On Anti-Colonial System Struggle Day on February 21 this year, a large number of Japanese youth and students held demonstrations and parades across the country against conscription and against rearmament. On the day the enslaving "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement" was signed, under the leadership of the Japanese Youth Fatherland Front, youth, students, and female workers from Tokyo and Iwate, Kyoto, and Gunma gathered at Sarue Park to hold the "National Youth Anti-Conscription General Uprising Conference," after which they held a demonstration. The next day (February 29), they held the National Youth Anti-Conscription Conference in Tokyo. The conference adopted specific plans for developing the anti-conscription movement throughout the country in the future. According to the resolution, the anti-conscription signature campaign will be promoted through various mass groups and organizations in the future, and core organizations for the anti-conscription movement will be established in various places. From then on, the Japanese National Youth Anti-Conscription Movement rapidly unfolded. In Akita Prefecture, while launching the anti-conscription movement, a movement to recall members of the "Police Reserve Force" was also launched. Dozens of mothers submitted petitions asking that their sons be discharged and return home. From February, students in Hokkaido, Kansai, and Kyushu also participated in the anti-conscription signature campaign. In late March, youths in Hyogo Prefecture and Mie Prefecture held rallies and demonstrations to oppose Japan's rearmament and oppose conscription. The youth and women's departments of various trade unions also called on the young workers and female members they lead to actively participate in the anti-conscription movement.

In order to crush the separate "peace treaty" and fascist legislation, Japanese youth and students held a strike protest on April 28. On June 17, in order to support the fourth general strike of workers, students from 31 junior colleges and above across the country held a strike in solidarity.

The Yoshida reactionary government is feeling terrified of the increasingly vigorous resistance movement of youth and students. When its methods of dividing and buying off students were completely ineffective, it used despicable means of depriving education, academic freedom, and sending special agents to sneak into schools, attempting to spy, monitor, and persecute patriotic youth and students. Since this year, many incidents of persecuting students have occurred in Japan, the most blatant of which were the Waseda University incident and the Aichi University incident on May 8.

The highest institution of learning in Japan—the University of Tokyo—has also been repeatedly persecuted, and the offices of the National Federation of Student Associations and the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of Student Associations located in the school were illegally closed. Students at the school have also repeatedly resisted for their rights.

***

In summary, people can clearly see that although the Japanese Yoshida government is obsequiously implementing U.S. imperialism's policy of aggressive war, the Japanese people today, including patriotic bourgeois elements, are more awake and more united. The Japanese people have resolutely and courageously stood up to fight for the freedom, independence, and peace of Japan. In this struggle, the Japanese people's national liberation, democratic, and united front is becoming wider and stronger. They are closely united around the vanguard of the Japanese working class, the Japanese Communist Party, which represents the interests of all Japanese people, and are fighting to complete the historical task of the Japanese national liberation and democratic revolution. The heroic struggle of the Japanese people has a significant effect on the peace of Asia and even the world, and therefore it is bound to receive the deep sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world.

    为自由、独立与和平而斗争的日本人民
    许予民
    一、高涨中的日本和平独立运动
    一九五一年九月八日，美国政府和日本吉田政府在旧金山签订了单独“和约”和“美日安全条约”。今年二月二十八日，又签订了具体执行“美日安全条约”军事协定的“美日行政协定”。这一系列违背国际协定的条约，不但根本违反日本人民对于自由、独立与和平的热望，反而规定了美国占领军继续长期占领日本，规定了美国在日本握有治外法权，规定了日本有协助美国假借联合国名义而采取的侵略行动的义务。正如日本共产党在四月二十八日——所谓“和约生效日”指出的，这些条约给日本人民带来的不是什么和平与独立，而是战争与屈辱。
    吉田反动政府为了执行这些卖国条约，为了执行美国加紧复活日本军国主义的政策，今年在国会中除了提出庞大的军事预算外，还拟订了一系列法西斯法案，企图借此剥夺日本人民的各种基本权利，压制他们争取自由独立与和平的正义斗争，使日本沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    然而，美帝国主义和吉田卖国集团是估计错了。自去年秋季以来，日本广大人民在日本共产党的领导下，为争取自由、独立与和平的运动波澜壮阔，走向了新的高涨。这种新高涨的集中表现，就是日本人民在今年“五一”节所举行的大示威。
    在“五一”这一天，全日本四百万工人、市民、学生、青年、妇女在全国各地四百八十多个地方举行了集会和示威。“反对重新武装日本，争取民族独立！”“美国兵滚回去！”“我们要保卫和平，反对战争！”的口号声，响彻了日本各个岛屿和各大城市。
    对于这些要求和平与独立的善良的日本人民，吉田反动政府预作布置，采取了血腥的镇压。在东京人民广场周围，特别布置了上万的警察，当游行队伍到达时，血腥的屠杀也就开始了。可是，愤怒的人民并没有在警棍、催泪弹、手枪面前屈服，他们赤手空拳地与警察坚持了两个多钟头的搏斗。美国占领军不但指挥而且直接参加了日本警察的野蛮镇压。日共议员风早八十二于五月六日在国会中严正地指出：“第一个先开枪的是美国宪兵。”
    日本人民这一次庄严的斗争，向全世界显示了他们的决心和力量，使帝国主义者大为震惊。据合众社五月二日华盛顿电，接近美国国务院的人士公开承认：“由五一示威游行可以看出，……日本人民显示了他们对西方的憎恨。”
    饱经战争灾祸的苦痛的日本人民，是强烈地要求和平的。尽管有美日反动派的疯狂迫害，日本人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的，已有六百三十万人，在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名的，也有六百万人。现在日本拥护和平委员会等组织已经发出了宣言，号召把六月二十五日至八月十五日作为日本的第二个和平月，在全国展开和平的活动。
    争取与亚洲各国建立友好关系及进行平等互惠的贸易，是日本人民和平独立运动的另一重要内容。日本人民深知，日本如果不能摆脱美国经济奴役的枷锁，是不可能有真正的独立和繁荣的和平生活的。在这方面，他们特别重视和新中国发展互惠的贸易关系。当中国的努力和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若等发起召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议并向日本发出了邀请之后，日本爱好和平人士平野义太郎与柳田谦十郎等立刻响应，成立了筹委会，决定派遣大山郁夫，前日本参议院副议长松本治一郎，淀川制钢社长宇田耕一和樱泽如一等人为出席代表。当中华全国总工会邀请日本工会代表前来北京参加“五一”节观礼时，日本工人们表示了极大的热情，共派出代表一百二十名。仅仅是由于吉田政府的无理阻挠，这些代表才未能到中国来。
    为了展开对中国的和平贸易，中日贸易促进会和日中友好协会都决定进行促进中日贸易的签名运动。国际经济会议的召开及中日贸易协议的签订，使日本各地的工商界都感到兴奋。他们正在纷纷组织起来，准备推进和平贸易。石川县的县议会和市议会，曾召集了一个包括地方团体、资本家、工会的“打开产业危机的经济会议”。关西的工商界更于六月二十六日成立了关西日中贸易促进会，决定发动一个全国性的运动，以促进中日贸易协议的实现。
    现在，日本人民正在积极筹备，准备迎接九月底在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    二、站在独立与和平斗争前列的日本工人
    日本工人的斗争，自去秋以来，就进入了一个新的阶段，而四月以来的五次罢工，更表现了日本工人的雄厚力量。
    远在去年十月下旬，当吉田政府迫使日本众议院批准卖国条约时，日本二十五万煤矿工人便从十月三十一日起罢工十二天。紧接着又有全日本十二万五千电力工人的罢工。而从十一月下旬起，以国营铁道工会（拥有三十八万七千会员）为首的日本工人，更举行了规模宏大的年关斗争。这个斗争虽以提高工资及发放年终津贴为主，但由于有关军事生产的企业如电力、煤矿等都参加了，它对于美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜战争与复活日本军国主义的计划，是一个直接的打击。
    以“防止破坏活动法案”为主的一连串反动法案，是日本人民所不能容忍的。根据这些法西斯法案，吉田反动政府可以宣布任何人民团体为非法。站在和平、独立斗争前列的日本工人，首先负起了对“防止破坏活动法案”作斗争的任务。自四月十二日至六月二十日，日本工人发动了五次全国性的罢工。在这五次罢工中，四月十八日第二次罢工参加人数超过一百万人，其他四次也都在四五十万人以上。在每次罢工时，还有数量众多的工人、农民、学生、文化界及其他阶层的人民，纷纷采用集会、示威、罢课等方式来支援罢工的工人。支援第二次罢工的工人，曾达到二百四十万人。
    这个反动法案虽然由于美日反动派的压迫，于七月三日在参院和七月四日在众院修正通过了，但日共国会议员团已经发出了声明，号召全国人民继续起来反对这个法西斯法案。
    日本工人不仅进行了上述五次大罢工，而且还同时为着自己的生存权利及改善生活待遇，进行了一连串的斗争。譬如三菱重工业公司下丸子工厂，是美军军需供应部管辖下的工厂，工人在刺刀下被迫修理美军的运输工具和坦克等武器。它同时是一座监狱，驻在厂里的一个连美国兵，可以用按有五寸长铁钉的橡木棍随便打人。工人再也忍不住了。他们知道修理坦克是为了更多地杀害朝鲜兄弟，便提出了不要多干活的口号，不断地进行集体歇班和怠工的斗争。他们以车间内的积极分子为核心，成立了反法西斯行动委员会。五月二十七日，他们举行了第一次二十四小时的全面罢工，接着又举行了第二次、第三次和第四次的罢工，停止了坦克的修理工作。他们在六月二日举行的最近一次罢工，时间延长到四十一小时。
    日本工人在斗争中同时也清洗了队伍中工贼分子。日本工会总评议会主席兼日本煤矿工会（简称“炭劳”）主席武藤武雄，在四月十二日罢工前夕，接受了吉田政府和垄断资本家的收买，临时下令“炭劳”的罢工延期到四月十八日。当消息传到各矿井时，矿工们愤怒地吼出了：“开除武藤！打死武藤！”结果，武藤及其他十四名决定延期罢工的中央斗争委员会委员，在四月二十六日“炭劳”第四次临时大会上被工人们撵走了，整个执行部被重新改选了，比较进步的分子在新的执行部中占了压倒优势。可以相信，日本工会在今后的复杂的斗争中，将更加巩固和壮大，从而大大地加强日本和平运动的力量。
    三、反对战争、反对封建剥削的日本农民
    美国军队的长久占领日本，以及代表地主、买办资本利益的吉田政府对农民所采取的掠夺政策，已使今天日本农村的景况极为悲惨。农民的耕地毫无补贴地被征用，以供美军和警察后备队当作军事基地；封建的租佃关系依然严重地存在；政府低价征购农民粮食的所谓征购运动，夺去了农民的口粮；农民负担的租税不断加重。这种情况，不能不引起日本农民的坚决反抗。
    日本农民斗争的内容是多种多样的。为了反对美帝国主义的长期占领和吉田政府的扩张军备的政策，他们首先进行反对征用土地作军事基地的斗争。这种基地所占用的土地面积，目前已达十六万三千町步（每町步约合一公顷）。这种斗争现在已扩大到全国。只要那个地方有军事基地，那个地方便有农民反对征用土地的斗争。青森县三泽美军机场周围的青年贫农，在被征用土地内组织了继续耕作同盟；东京多摩川一带，美军为构筑军事基地而滥伐山林，以致河流失掉灌溉的作用，该基地周围的贫农，便组织了“民族独立狙击队”。最近，吉田政府又把富士山麓的东方和北方一带地区供给美军作演习之用，剥夺了农民祖传的田地和山林。静冈县以御殿场为中心的十个村镇的农民，山梨县南都留郡、西八代郡一带的农民，都遭遇到同样的命运。然而这一带的农民为使富士山归还于日本人民，组织了自卫队。工人也和农民一道，在村里张贴“还我田地”、“占领军滚回去”的标语。他们一致喊出了“富士山是我们的！”的雄壮口号。
    日本农民和封建地主间的斗争，是愈来愈尖锐了。长野县北佐久郡某村农民，为了反对地主夺地、反对封建地主的各种特权，曾组织了有一百七十名代表参加的“土地管理组合”，实行自卫。农民反对地主控制山林的斗争也在展开中。在日本的国有、公有、私有山林地区中，农民们都展开着以实力采伐山林的斗争。在南佐久郡，由田口村、北牧村带头，以贫农、失业者、半失业者为核心成立了山林解放队，开始以实力采伐国有森林。
    目前，日本农民除了进行反对夺地（包括征用军事基地及地主强力夺地）、反对征粮、要求开放山林以及拒缴重税的斗争外，还进行了一连串反对吉田政府反动农业政策的斗争，如争取提高征购米价、争取废除债务和争取灾害补助金等等。
    日本全国有一百多万渔民，他们世世代代靠捕鱼为生。战后，美军在沿海各地圈划海面为演习地，禁止渔民入内捕鱼，这就迫使他们走头无路，不能不群起斗争。千叶县九十九里滨一带的渔民，冒着生命的危险，利用薄雾时分到禁区捕鱼，曾迫使美军不能不停止打靶。他们现在已明确地提出“撤除美国的演习场，停止为了战争构筑飞机场，退还我们的渔场”的口号。以长崎、五岛列岛（属九州）为中心的渔民，自去秋以来便起来斗争，终于夺回了自由党在该地区所霸占的渔场。在斗争中，他们提出“打倒吉田卖国政府，美国佬滚回去”的口号。
    四、不愿再当炮灰的日本青年、学生
    如所周知，美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的主要目的之一，是要在日本解决它进行战争所缺少的人力。但是，今天日本的青年、学生再也不愿充当任何战争阴谋者的炮灰了。在今年二月二十一日反殖民地制度斗争日，日本广大的青年、学生，在全国各地举行了反对征兵、反对重整军备的示威游行。当奴役性的“美日行政协定”签字的那一天，在日本青年祖国战线的领导下，东京及来自岩手、京都、群马等地的青年、学生、女工就在猿江公园举行了“全国青年反对征兵总奋起大会”，会后并示威游行。第二天（二月二十九日），他们在东京又举行了全国青年反对征兵会议。会议通过了今后在全国发展反对征兵运动的具体方案。根据决议，今后将通过各种群众团体和组织，推进反对征兵的签名运动，并将在各地建立反对征兵运动的核心组织。从这以后，日本全国青年反对征兵运动便急剧地展开了。在秋田县，与展开反对征兵运动同时，还展开了召回“警察后备队”队员的运动，数十名母亲提出了请愿书，要求让她们的儿子退伍回家。从二月开始，北海道、关西和九州等地学生也纷纷参加了反对征兵签名运动。三月下旬，兵库县和三重县的青年，都举行了集会与游行示威，来反对日本重整军备，反对征兵。各工会的青年部和妇女部，也都号召他们所领导的青年工人与妇女会员们积极参加反对征兵的运动。
    为着粉碎单独“和约”和法西斯立法，日本青年、学生在四月二十八日举行罢课抗议。六月十七日，为了支持工人的第四次总罢工，全国三十一所专科以上院校的学生，举行了声援罢课。
    吉田反动政府对于青年学生日益蓬勃的反抗运动是感到战栗的。当它用分化、收买学生的方法完全无效时，它便使用剥夺教育、学术自由和派遣特务潜入学校的卑劣手段，企图侦察、监视和迫害爱国的青年学生。日本自今年以来发生了不少次迫害学生的事件，其中最露骨的便是五月八日的早稻田大学事件和爱知大学事件。
    日本的最高学府——东京大学，同样地屡受迫害，设于该校的全国学生自治会联合会及东京都学生自治会联合会办公室被非法封闭。该校学生为了自己的权利，也迭次进行反抗。
    ×××
    综上所述，人们可以清楚地看出，虽然日本吉田政府在奴颜婢膝地执行美帝国主义的侵略战争政策，但是，今天的日本人民，包括爱国的资产阶级分子在内，是更加觉悟，更加团结了。日本人民已经坚决而勇敢地站起来，为日本的自由、独立与和平而斗争。在这个斗争中，日本人民的民族解放民主统一战线正愈来愈广泛，愈来愈坚强。他们紧紧地团结在日本工人阶级的先锋队、代表全日本人民利益的日本共产党的周围，为完成日本民族解放民主革命的历史任务而奋斗。日本人民的英勇斗争，对于亚洲乃至全世界的和平，是有重大作用的，因此它必然得到中国人民、亚洲人民以及全世界人民的深切的同情与支持。（新华社特约稿）
