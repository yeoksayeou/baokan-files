Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd. According to TASS: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women’s Federation continued its discussion of Mrs. Gordon's report on the 19th, and heard the report by Iranian Democratic Women's representative Chaminé on the second agenda item.

    During the discussion of Mrs. Gordon's report, representatives from the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Albania, Romania, Norway, Poland, and Belgium spoke. British representative Geoffrey said: The political views of the British people—especially British women—are undergoing tremendous changes. The National Women's Conference held in early March was attended by 1,500 representatives from all regions of the United Kingdom. Most of the representatives were housewives. The conference discussed the issue of peace and the cessation of the Korean War. Currently, 200 women's committees have been established across the United Kingdom, maintaining contact with the National Committee. British women are increasingly determined to demand the return of their husbands and children from Korea. Geoffrey called on women worldwide to strengthen their ties with women in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, saying that organizing delegations of women to visit countries in the camp of peace and socialism would help consolidate world peace. Italian representative Rossi said: Italian women are actively fighting for peace, and the National Anti-Bacterial Warfare Day held in Italy on May 8 was initiated by women. Italian women, like women all over the world, are looking forward to the World People's Peace Conference and believe that they will achieve victory. French representative Maday spoke about the growing strength of the women's movement in France.

    Iranian representative Chaminé, presenting a report on the agenda item "The Task of Women's Organizations in All Countries to Defend Women's Equal Rights," said: For decades, women have been fighting for freedom, full equality, and the right to participate in political, economic, and public activities. In the struggle for women's rights, women have achieved great victories, and in one-third of the world's land, they already enjoy equal rights with men. Women in the Soviet Union, China, various People's Democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic enjoy equal rights in all aspects of life, and their example is encouraging working women around the world to wage a determined struggle for their rights. Chaminé emphasized that the equal right of women to equal pay for equal work either does not exist or is greatly restricted in capitalist countries. It is known that through the ruthless exploitation of women's labor, American electrical equipment industry tycoons receive more than 4.7 billion yuan in excess profits annually. The situation of working women in the United Kingdom, Italy, and other countries is also similar. Working women in colonies and dependencies have virtually no rights. In Syria, women work sixteen hours a day, doing the same work as men, but receive only half the wages. In some British colonies, women do the same work as men, but earn 60 percent less than men. Chaminé said: The International Democratic Women's Federation should pay special attention to the fact that most women in capitalist camp countries have not joined trade unions. Democratic women's organizations in all countries must find ways to actively cooperate with the trade union movement in their respective countries. When discussing the task of women's organizations to fight for women's social rights, Chaminé said: In capitalist countries, the arms expansion movement has further curtailed women's social rights, while in colonies and dependencies, these rights simply do not exist. The situation of women in Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Transjordan, Sudan, and some other countries is extremely dire. In the city of Baghdad, Iraq, with a population of over 450,000, all the obstetrics and gynecology hospitals have a total of only 60 beds. Chaminé pointed out that despite these obstacles, the movement for women's rights is flourishing in all capitalist countries. The International Democratic Women's Federation must establish contact with mass women's organizations that are fighting for women's full and equal rights. We must immediately and vigorously launch activities to expand the movement for women's rights. This will be an important contribution to the preparations for the Third International Women's Congress next summer.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 23rd. According to TASS: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation continued its meeting on the 20th. The meeting concluded the discussion of the report by Iranian representative Chaminé on "The Task of Women's Organizations in All Countries to Defend Women's Equal Rights," and heard the report by Santi (Italy), Deputy Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, on the third agenda item, "The Achievements of International Children's Day and the Tasks of Strengthening Child Protection Activities."

    During the discussion of Chaminé's report, Italian representative Picardo said: About five million women work in Italian industry, of whom almost one million are chronically unemployed, and another one million work only two or three months a year. Picardo introduced the struggle of the Italian Women's Alliance to improve the lives of female workers, saying that due to the active actions taken by women, employers and local authorities have made concessions. American Democratic Women representative Cranney pointed out that the so-called "American way of life" is a way of enslaving and oppressing the working people. She emphasized that American women are working to oppose the adventurous plans of American and British imperialists.

    Bucharest working women held a grand mass meeting at the "Freedom" Park's summer theater on the 21st to celebrate the holding of the Executive Committee meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Bucharest. Mrs. Gordon and many members of the Executive Committee attended the meeting. Soviet representative Popova and Chinese representative Shen Yuanhui spoke at the meeting and were warmly welcomed.

    国际民主妇联执行委员会会议继续举行
    夏米妮和桑蒂分别就第二项和第三项议程提出报告
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会会议十九日继续讨论戈登夫人的报告，并听取伊朗民主妇女代表夏米妮就第二项议程所作的报告。
    在讨论戈登夫人的报告时，发言的有英国、意大利、法国、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚、挪威、波兰和比利时等国的代表。英国代表杰弗莉说：英国人民——特别是英国妇女的政治见解正在发生巨大的变化。三月初举行的全国妇女大会，有英国各地区的一千五百名代表参加。代表们大多数是家庭妇女。大会讨论了和平问题和停止朝鲜战争问题。现在，英国各地已经成立了二百个妇女委员会，和全国委员会保持联系。英国妇女日益坚决地要求让她们的丈夫和孩子从朝鲜回来。杰弗莉要求全世界的妇女加强她们和苏联、中国及人民民主国家妇女的联系，她说妇女们组织代表团到和平与社会主义阵营的国家去访问，将有助于巩固全世界的和平。意大利代表罗西说：意大利妇女正积极为和平而斗争，五月八日在意大利举行的全国反细菌战争日就是由妇女发起的。意大利妇女和全世界妇女同样地盼望着世界人民和平大会的召开，并相信她们必将取得胜利。法国代表马黛发言叙述了法国妇女运动日益壮大的情形。
    伊朗代表夏米妮就“各国妇女组织保卫妇女平等权利的任务”的议程提出报告说：几十年以来，妇女们一直在为争取自由，争取完全平等，争取参加政治、经济和公共活动的权利而斗争。在争取妇女权利的斗争中，妇女们已经获得了伟大的胜利，在地球上的三分之一的土地上，她们已经享有与男人平等的权利。苏联、中国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国妇女们在生活的各方面都享有平等的权利，她们的榜样正鼓舞着全世界的劳动妇女为争取自己的权利而进行坚决的斗争。夏米妮强调说：妇女与男子同工同酬的平等权利在资本主义国家里不是不存在，就是受到很大限制。人们知道：通过对妇女劳动的无情剥削，美国电工器材工业大亨每年得到四十七亿元以上的超额利润。英国、意大利和其他国家的劳动妇女的境况也是这样的。殖民地和附属国劳动妇女则根本没有什么权利。在叙利亚，妇女们一天工作十六小时，她们和男子做同样的工作，但只拿一半工资。在一些英属殖民地里，妇女和男子做同样的工作，但所得的工资比男子少百分之六十。夏米妮说：国际民主妇联应该特别注意资本主义阵营国家里大多数妇女还没有参加工会这一情况。各国民主妇女组织必须设法与各该国的工会运动积极合作。夏米妮谈到妇女组织为妇女争取社会权利的任务时说：在资本主义国家里，扩张军备运动进一步削减了妇女的社会权利，而在殖民地和附属国，这些权利根本就不存在。伊朗、伊拉克、埃及、外约旦、苏丹和一些其他国家的妇女的境况极为悲惨。在伊拉克的人口超过四十五万的巴格达市，所有妇产科医院总共只有六十张病床。夏米妮指出：尽管有这些障碍，在一切资本主义国家里，妇女争取权利的运动仍在蓬勃展开。国际民主妇联必须与那些为争取妇女的充分的平等权利而斗争的妇女群众团体建立联系。我们要立即大力地展开活动，来扩大争取妇女权利的运动。这对于明年夏天举行的第三届国际妇女代表大会的筹备工作将会有重要的贡献。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会二十日继续开会。会议结束了对于伊朗代表夏米妮的“各国妇女组织保卫妇女平等权利的任务”的报告的讨论，听取了国际民主妇联副总书记桑蒂（意大利）就第三项议程“国际儿童节的成绩和加强保卫儿童活动的任务”所作的报告。
    在讨论夏米妮的报告时，意大利代表皮卡拉多说：在意大利工业中工作的约有五百万妇女，其中几乎有一百万人长期失业，另有一百万人一年只工作两三个月。皮卡拉多介绍了意大利妇女联盟争取改善女工生活的斗争情况，她说由于妇女们采取了积极行动，已经使雇主和地方当局让步。美国民主妇女代表克兰妮指出：所谓“美国生活方式”是一种奴役和压迫劳动人民的方式。她强调说：美国妇女正在努力反对美英帝国主义者的冒险计划。
    布加勒斯特劳动妇女二十一日在“自由”公园的夏季剧院举行盛大群众大会，庆祝国际民主妇联执委会会议在布加勒斯特开会。戈登夫人和执委会委员多人都参加了大会。苏联代表波波娃和中国代表沈元晖在会上讲话，受到热烈欢迎。
