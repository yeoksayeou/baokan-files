Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, July 27th: At the plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference on the afternoon of the 26th, Su Jingguan, head of the delegation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodged a strong protest against the illegal admission of Kuomintang remnants to the conference. Referring to the joint statement issued on the 25th, Su Jingguan said, "The Standing Committee has infringed upon the legitimate rights of one of the legitimate members of the conference—the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Red Cross Society—at this conference." He further pointed out that the decision of the Standing Committee violated the regulations and principles of the International Red Cross and "seriously damaged the status and prestige of the 18th International Conference."

After Paul Ruegger, the chairman of the so-called provisional committee, delivered an opening speech and introduced Canada's Macauley to the chairmanship, Su Jingguan immediately stood up to protest and suggested that the Kuomintang puppets posing as Chinese representatives be immediately expelled from the conference. However, Ruegger initially prevented him from speaking under the pretext of "violating the rules." It was only through Su Jingguan's just and forceful insistence that Su Jingguan was able to make a statement of protest and propose a motion. However, the motion was unreasonably suppressed by the chairman. Soviet government representative Zonov repeatedly requested to speak, but was ignored.

After ten minutes, after other matters were concluded, Su Jingguan was able to express his great regret over this erroneous ruling. Reporters heard that fair-minded representatives from many countries were surprised by this abnormal phenomenon, because although the Soviet delegation repeatedly requested to speak, they were consciously blocked, while a Kuomintang puppet was given the opportunity to speak. This person spoke in English and slandered in the same tone as his American masters. The chairman then hurriedly announced the adjournment of the meeting, leaving this unresolved issue to be resolved at the next plenary session.

    出席国际红十字大会我国代表团长
    苏井观提出强硬抗议
    反对非法容许台湾残匪参加大会
    【新华社多伦多二十七日电】在二十六日下午国际红十字大会全体会议上，中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表团团长苏井观对于非法容许国民党残余分子参加大会，提出强硬抗议。苏井观在提到二十五日发表的联合声明时说：“常设委员会侵犯了大会的合法成员之一——中华人民共和国和中国红十字会在本大会的合法权利。”他进一步指出，常设委员会的决定破坏了国际红十字会的规程与原则，并且“严重损害了第十八届国际大会的地位和威信”。
    在所谓临时委员会主席保罗·吕格发表开幕词并介绍加拿大的马考莱就主席位后，苏井观即起立提出抗议，并建议立即把那些冒充中国代表的国民党傀儡逐出大会。但吕格起初以“违反规则”为藉口阻止他发言。只是由于苏井观的义正词严的坚持，苏井观才得以发表抗议声明和提出动议。但动议又被主席无理扣压。苏联政府代表左诺夫屡次要求发言，都被置之不理。
    经过十分钟，在其他事情结束后，苏井观才能对这一错误的裁决表示极大的遗憾。记者听见很多国家的公正的代表都对这种反常的现象表示吃惊，因为尽管苏联代表团一再要求发言，却被有意识地加以拦阻，而一个国民党傀儡反而得到发言的机会。这个人用英语发言，并用和他的美国主子一样的语气进行毁谤。主席接着匆匆地宣布休会，把这个没有解决的问题留待下次全体会议解决。
