Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: According to TASS, the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal officially opened to navigation on the 27th. A grand opening ceremony was held on this day near the canal entrance near Stalingrad, attended by thousands of people from Stalingrad and guests who had come specifically to attend the ceremony. The ceremony was presided over by Shashkov, the Soviet Minister of Inland Water Transport. On behalf of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he warmly congratulated the canal builders and all working people on the successful completion of the canal and announced its official opening. His speech was extremely well received and frequently interrupted by enthusiastic applause. Then, the chief person in charge of the construction project, Shiktotorov, and representatives of the Stalingrad people's organizations, collective farmers, workers, and builders spoke successively, warmly celebrating this brilliant victory of the Soviet working people. Finally, the assembly passed a telegram of tribute to Stalin amidst enthusiastic cheers. After the meeting, the diesel-powered passenger ship "Joseph Stalin" (flagship of the Moscow Canal fleet), fully decorated with colorful flags, led a group of ships into the canal in a grand procession, and regular navigation of the canal officially began.

The first ship on one of the main routes of the canal—the Moscow-Rostov line—the "Soviet Republic" also set sail from the North Port of Moscow on this day. Tens of thousands of Moscow citizens and crew members along the Moscow-Volga Canal route went to the port to see the ship off, and a mass meeting was held on the dock. At the meeting, Shemakin, the person in charge of the new route, excitedly said: The people's long-cherished ideal has been realized, and the Soviet capital has become a port accessible to five seas. The Soviet people are honored by the first victory of this great communist construction project. He then paid tribute to the canal builders. After the meeting, the "Soviet Republic," carrying a large number of workers, staff, students, engineers, scientists, artists, and writers from various industries in Moscow who were taking vacations to visit the canal, set off for the Volga River. At this time, the sound of all ships celebrating the opening of the new route echoed over the Khimki Reservoir.
