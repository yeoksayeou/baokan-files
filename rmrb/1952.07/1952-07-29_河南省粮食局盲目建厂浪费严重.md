    Henan Grain Bureau's Blind Construction of Factories Causes Serious Waste
    Editor: Leading cadres of the Henan Grain Bureau, with a bureaucratic attitude, blindly constructed flour mills, resulting in a loss of approximately 3.5 billion yuan of state funds.
    The Henan Grain Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Bureau) began building a flour mill on Muchang Street in Kaifeng. When most of the project was nearing completion, the leadership realized that the factory and warehouse were three or four *li* apart, and the cost of transporting raw materials and finished products would be too high after production began. Therefore, it was decided to dismantle this project and rebuild the factory on the site of the Second Grain Depot in Nanguan, Kaifeng. However, due to Deputy Director Huang of the Provincial Bureau not having a thorough design, after we demolished a new warehouse and converted it into a machine room, he felt that a mill with one-and-a-half sets of grinding equipment was too small, and the cost would be too high after production began. He suggested that the Provincial Bureau change it to a three-set mill. After research by relevant parties, it was believed that even if it were changed to a three-set flour mill, the cost of flour in the future would still be too high, and the machine room was converted from a warehouse, so it might not be sturdy. Therefore, it was decided to stop the construction work in Kaifeng and concentrate efforts on preparing to build the Luohe Flour Mill. According to what we know, these two incidents alone resulted in a loss of over 200 million yuan.
    The above two losses did not attract the attention of the leading cadres of the Provincial Bureau, and they still blindly prepared to build the Luohe Flour Mill. At the beginning of the preparation, we asked Deputy Director Huang, "Has the construction of the Luohe Power Plant been decided?" Without contacting all parties, he replied, "No problem." He sent people to East China to order machine tools, purchase materials, and retrieve old machines from Zhenjiang; he asked the Henan Construction Company to design drawings and buy green bricks and cement. To build the factory, it occupied a vegetable garden area of 160 meters in length from east to west and 157 meters in length from north to south in Luohe, demolished more than 20 civilian houses (relocation fees have been paid), and compensated the masses for crops, totaling approximately 3 billion yuan. Now, problems have arisen with the construction of the Luohe Power Plant, so the power for the flour mill cannot be resolved, and construction has had to be stopped again. Approximately 3 billion yuan of funds have been tied up in this way.
    We believe that the reason for these losses is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of the Provincial Bureau. From the beginning of the factory construction to the present, more than ten months have passed, and the leading cadres have never personally inspected it, nor have they sent anyone to see it. It is wrong for the leading cadres of the Provincial Bureau to take such an attitude towards basic construction work and should make a profound self-criticism. We hope that the Central Grain Administration and the Henan Provincial Department of Finance will promptly and earnestly handle this issue.
                                                                                                          Qin Han Zhou Shimei

### 河南省粮食局盲目建厂浪费严重

    河南省粮食局盲目建厂浪费严重
    编辑同志：河南省粮食局领导干部以官僚主义态度盲目地修建面粉厂，损失国家资金约三十五亿余元。
    河南省粮食局（下称省局）在开封木长街兴建一个面粉厂，当大部分工程已经就绪时，领导方面才想起工厂和仓库距离三、四里远，开工后运输原料和成品时费用太大。因此，便决定把这一工程拆掉，改在开封南关第二粮库地址上重建厂房。但是由于省局黄副局长没有周密设计，等到我们把一个新仓库拆掉改成机器房后，他又觉得一部半磨的厂子太小，开工后成本太高，建议省局改为三部磨的。经过有关方面研究后，认为即使改成三部磨的面粉厂，将来的面粉成本还是过高，同时机器房又是由仓库改的，恐怕不坚固。因此，又决定停止在开封建厂工作，集中力量筹备建筑漯河面粉厂。仅据我们所知，这两次共损失两亿余元。
    以上两次的损失，并没有引起省局领导干部的重视，他们仍然盲目地筹建漯河面粉厂。在开始筹备时，我们曾问黄副局长：“漯河电厂的兴建是否决定了？”他没有同各方联系好就答复说：“没有问题。”并派人去华东订制工作母机、购买材料、提取镇江的旧机器；叫河南省建筑公司设计绘图，买青砖、洋灰。为了建厂，在漯河占去东西长一六零公尺，南北长一五七公尺的菜园地，拆毁民房二十余间（已发迁移费），赔偿群众农作物等，共计开支三十亿元左右。现在漯河电厂的兴建发生了问题，因而面粉厂的动力没法解决，只好又停止兴建。三十亿元左右的资金，就这样被积压起来了。
    我们认为造成这些损失的原因，是和省局领导干部严重的官僚主义作风分不开的。自建厂开始到现在，已有十多个月，领导干部从没有亲自检查，也没派人去看过。省局领导干部采取这样的态度对待基本建设工作，是错误的，应作深刻检讨。我们希望中央粮食总局和河南省财政厅及时地认真地处理这一问题。  秦翰  周世美
