    Guarantee to Learn Two Thousand Characters This Year
    Comrade Editor: We learned from the newspapers of the motherland that the broad masses of the people in the motherland are vigorously launching a rapid literacy campaign. In the distant Korean battlefield, we have also enthusiastically launched a rapid literacy learning campaign. Many of our soldiers did not recognize characters in the past. They deeply know the pain of illiteracy and the importance of learning culture. They clearly realize that without a certain level of education, it is impossible to master modern weapons. Therefore, in this learning campaign, their enthusiasm is particularly high. They have overcome all difficulties, created various learning tools, and seized all available time to learn in their busy schedules. On the hillsides and in the woods, you can hear the soldiers reading phonetic symbols everywhere. Some people even write phonetic symbols on their arms, chanting while carrying water. Everyone is determined to recognize two thousand characters in 1952, and guarantee to advance alongside the people of the motherland on the front of cultural learning.

    保证今年认识两千个字
    编辑同志：我们从祖国的报纸上知道祖国广大人民正在轰轰烈烈地展开速成识字运动。我们在遥远的朝鲜战地，也热烈地展开了一个速成识字的学习运动。我们许多战士过去都是不认识字的，他们深知不识字的痛苦和学习文化的重要，他们清楚地认识到：没有一定的文化水平是不能掌握现代化武器的。因此他们在这次学习运动中，情绪特别高涨，他们克服了一切困难，创造了各种的学习工具，又在百忙中，抓紧一切可利用的时间来学习，在山坡上、树林里，到处都可以听到战士们读注音符号的声音，还有人把注音符号写在胳膊上，一边挑水，一边念。人人都下定决心，一定要在一九五二年里，认识两千个字，保证和祖国人民在学习文化的战线上，一道前进。
