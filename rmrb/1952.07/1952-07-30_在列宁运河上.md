    On the Lenin Canal

    The great construction project is completed. Construction sites are being dismantled of excavators, machines, and machinery. All kinds of complex machines are being transported to build irrigation systems in Stalingrad and Rostov Oblast, and to build the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations and the Turkmen Main Canal. These machines still have much work to do for the cause of transforming nature. These days, whether at the station or on the railway siding, wagons loaded with machinery and equipment can be seen everywhere. The people who built this magnificent and amazing building of the great Stalin era in a short period of time are enthusiastically bidding farewell to the Volga-Don.
    Here, on the locks, dams, and many hydraulic engineering structures, are displayed the labor, strength, energy, and creativity of the canal builders.
    Lock No. 13 is as magnificent as Lock No. 1, and people call it the gate of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. Everything has changed! Only half a year ago, on this vast construction site, trucks were still running back and forth, excavators and bulldozers were moving, loosening the soil, and the long arms of mobile excavators and cranes towered in the sky, with piles of brownish-yellow mud, gravel, and soil everywhere on the construction site.
    Now the lock site is quiet.
    An asphalt road leading to the lock has been paved. Various flowers have been planted along the road, and the clover planted not long ago is already green. Trees that have been transplanted for many years have been moved near the lock. The slopes are covered with grass. In front of the lock, two snow-white towers that control the gates stand tall. These two towers are inlaid with bronze ornaments and sculptures. Hundreds of meters from the lock, a reinforced concrete wall stretches out, where ships and barges are moored.
    You will definitely see the magnificent archway standing on the lock first. The archway is as tall as a twelve-story building. Its surface is covered with white marble. Above the archway, four sculptures are installed. Each of them is five meters high.
    On the side of the archway facing the Don River, there are two reliefs depicting Soviet soldiers. On the pediment, we can see the inscription in gold letters: "Glory to the ever-victorious Soviet Army!"
    Lock No. 13 was built using the latest technology. Automatic manipulators are installed on the towers, and ships can pass through the lock with the help of automatic manipulators.
    We climbed onto the archway. From here, we can clearly see everything in the distance. The Karpovka Reservoir stretches out in front of us. The vast ocean is rippling with waves. Busy motorboats are running around, and steamers and self-propelled barges are sailing freely. The shore of the reservoir is shimmering with bright white light, which is the Cossack village of Ilyevka. The 13th lock was built on the site of this village. The state helped the Cossacks move there and settled into new homes.
    A pumping station building stands on our right. Like the tower controlling the lock, it shines with the white light of marble in the sun. The working unit transmits a rumbling sound. A foamy wave extends from the pumping station to the sea, and powerful pumps constantly pump water from the Don River into the canal. Since the pumping station was put into operation, tens of millions of cubic meters of water have been pumped.
    A cool breeze mixed with moisture blows over.
    "This is blowing from the Tsimlyansk Sea," the builders explained.
    The long belt of the canal is several kilometers from the lock to the Don River, and the slopes of the canal are evenly paved with stones. The rushing waves hit the rocky shore and then break up into jumping little stars. The canal passes through the grassland and flows into the Don River. Here stands a solemn white building. This is the lighthouse. At the foot of the lighthouse, symbolic sculptures seem to be two bows of ships extending from under the building. The lighthouse is searching. Every night, the bright light of the searchlight shines on the road for ships sailing to the canal.
    A wide asphalt road leads from the town of Kalach along the canal to Stalingrad.
    Ahead is the Belyayevka Reservoir. This vast sea is smaller than the other two reservoirs of the canal, but it is still great.
    Here, maple trees are planted on both sides of the canal. There are two shady avenues next to the weir gate, as if they have been planted for many years. In fact, these trees were only planted in January this year.
    At the end of the Belyayevka Reservoir is Lock No. 10. Several huge anchors are firmly tied to the foot of its control tower.
    The young lock project director, Goreta Sheklanova, greeted us. The people of her project have completed all the construction projects and are now preparing to leave for other great construction sites. Goreta Sheklanova is also leaving here. She told us:
    "More than one hundred ships have now passed through Lock No. 10. The passage of ships through the lock proves that the machinery is running non-stop. The time for ships to pass through the lock is shortening day by day."
    Behind Lock No. 10, the wide Varvarovka Reservoir unfolds. There are piers and passenger stations at the berthing location. Our car crossed the watershed and drove onto the bridge erected on the canal. From this place, you can see the towers of several locks. Their pediments are decorated with carvings and reliefs.
    Behind Lock No. 2 is the great Volga River. Ships preparing to go to the Don River are berthed in the parking lot near the canal entrance. Two barges carrying stones and wood are passing through the lock. The sound of the whistles of ships, steamers, and tugboats echoes in the water. Ships sail along the canal day and night.
    Two hundred meters from the Volga River, at the entrance of the canal, Lock No. 1 was built.
    The Lenin Volga-Don Canal starts from the Volga River opposite Sarpy Island. The magnificent statue of the great Communist architect Stalin marks the starting point of the canal. All the people who built the Volga-Don Canal are living happy days. The government's resolution on the canal opening to navigation and the decree naming the canal after Lenin are inspiring. Many congresses and conferences have been held on the locks and pumping stations.
    "The historical event is completed," said Comrade Drachev, who led the construction of Lock No. 13, "The two great Russian rivers - the Volga River - the Don River are connected. The dream of the Russian people for centuries has been realized! Ships are sailing along the new waterway that connects the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the White Sea."
    Comrade Protopopov, a staff member of Lock No. 2, said:
    "More than one hundred ships have passed through our lock. This wonderful canal, built in the shortest period of time, is the outstanding victory of our people marching towards communism under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the leadership of the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin."
    The builders of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal said in unison:
    "We will gloriously maintain the glorious tradition of the canal builders who represent a model of selfless labor!"
    All the people who built the canal are warmly welcoming the wonderful day of the canal opening to navigation.

专栏：

    在列宁运河上
    伟大的建设工程完成了。工地上正在拆卸着掘土机、机器和机械。各种各样的复杂的机器正在运去建造斯大林格勒和罗斯多夫州的灌溉系统，建造古比雪夫、斯大林格勒水力发电站和土库曼大运河。这些机器仍然要为改造自然的事业做许多工作。这几天，无论在车站上、在铁路的待运线上，到处都可以看见装着机器设备的车箱。在短期间内就把这个伟大斯大林时代的美妙的、令人惊奇的建筑物建造起来的人们，正在热情地和伏尔加河—顿河告别。
    这里，在水闸上、堤坝上和许多水利工程建筑物上，都表现着运河建筑者的劳动、力量、精力和创作。
    第十三号水闸也像第一号水闸一样雄伟，人们把它叫做列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的大门。一切都改观了！仅仅半年以前，在这里的辽阔的工地上，卡车还来回跑着，掘土机和开路机在走动，翻松着土壤，活动掘土机和起重机的长臂高耸在天空中，在建筑现场上到处都堆积着棕黄色的泥土、沙石和土壤。
    现在水闸的工地上是一片寂静。
    一条通达水闸的柏油路已经铺设好了。在路旁，栽了各种花卉，不久以前栽种的三叶草已呈现出绿色。水闸的附近移植了多年的树木。斜坡上覆满青草。在水闸的前边，高高地矗立着两座雪白的操纵闸门的塔楼。这两座塔楼上镶着青铜制成的装饰品和雕塑物。距水闸数百公尺的地方，伸展着一条停靠着轮船和驳船的钢筋水泥壁。
    你一定首先就看到耸立在水闸上的宏伟的拱门。拱门和十二层楼一样高。它的面上铺着白色大理石。拱门的上方，装置着四个雕塑物。其中每一个都有五公尺高。
    在拱门面向顿河的一面，有两个描画苏军战士的浮雕。在三角顶上，我们可以看到金字的题词：“光荣属于常胜的苏军！”
    第十三号水闸是应用最新技术建造起来的。自动操纵机安装在塔楼上，船只借助自动操纵机就可以通过水闸。
    我们登上拱门。从这里了望四周，可以清楚地看到远处的一切。卡尔波夫卡水库伸展在我们的面前。辽阔的海洋上起伏着微波。忙碌的汽艇跑来跑去，汽船和自动驳船自在地行驶着。水库的岸上闪烁着鲜明的白光，那里就是哥萨克的伊里耶夫卡农庄。从前这个村庄的所在地，现在建起了第十三号水闸。国家帮助哥萨克人移居到那里去，并安置了新的家园。
    一座抽水站的建筑物耸立在我们右边。它也像操纵水闸的塔楼一样，在阳光下闪耀着大理石的白光。正在工作的联合机传来了隆隆的声音。一道泛起泡沫的碎波从抽水站延伸到海上，强有力的抽水机把顿河的水不停地抽进运河去。自从抽水站开动以来，数万万立方公尺的水都抽过去了。
    吹过来一阵清凉的，夹杂着湿气的微风。
    “这是从齐姆良海吹来的，”建造者们解释说。
    运河的长带从水闸到顿河有好几公里，运河的斜坡上均匀地铺砌着石块。冲过来的波浪击打着石岸，随后分散成跳跃的小星点。运河穿过了草原，流入顿河。这里耸立着庄严的白色建筑物。这是灯塔。在灯塔的脚下，象征性的雕塑物好像是从建筑物底下伸出来的两个船头一样。灯塔在探照着。每天夜晚，探照灯的明亮的光都照耀着驶到运河的船只的道路。
    宽阔的柏油路从卡拉奇镇沿着运河直达斯大林格勒。
    前面就是贝利拉夫卡水库。这个辽阔的海比运河其他两个水库小些，但是它仍然是伟大的。
    这里，运河的两岸栽植着枫树。堰坝门旁有两道林荫，好像已栽种许多年了，实际上，这些树木是在今年一月才栽上的。
    贝利拉夫卡水库的尾部是第十号水闸。在它的操纵塔楼的脚部，牢牢地系着几条巨大的铁锚。
    年青的水闸工程主任哥列塔·谢克拉诺娃迎接我们。她的这段工程的人们已经完成了全部建筑工程，现在正准备出发到其他的伟大建筑现场去。哥列塔·谢克拉诺娃也要离开这里。她告诉我们说：
    “现在已有一百多只航船通过了第十号水闸。船只通过水闸证明机械在不停地开动。船只通过水闸的时间正在逐日缩短。”
    在第十号水闸后面，展开了宽广的瓦尔瓦罗夫卡水库。在停泊地点建有码头和客运站。我们的汽车翻过分水岭，驶上架在运河上的桥。从这个地方可以看到好几个水闸的塔楼。它们的三角顶上都装饰着雕刻和浮雕。
    第二号水闸后面是伟大的伏尔加河。准备开往顿河去的船只都停泊在运河进口附近的停泊场上。载运着石头、木材的两只驳船正在通过水闸。轮船、汽船和拖船的汽笛声和在水上回声应和着。船只沿着运河日夜行驶着。
    距伏尔加河二百公尺，在运河的进口处，建起了第一号水闸。
    列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河是从对着萨尔宾岛的伏尔加河开始的。伟大的共产主义建筑师斯大林的宏伟的雕像标志着运河的起点。修建伏尔加河—顿河运河的全体人员过着愉快的日子。政府关于运河通航的决议和以列宁命名这条运河的法令，令人欢欣鼓舞。在水闸上、在抽水站上举行了许多次大会和会议。
    “历史性的事件完成了”，领导修建第十三号水闸的德拉切夫同志说，“两条伟大的俄罗斯河流——伏尔加河——顿河连接在一起了。俄罗斯人民数世纪来的梦想实现了！船只沿着把黑海、亚速海、里海、波罗的海和白海贯通起来的新水道上航行着。”
    第二号水闸的工作人员普罗托波波夫同志说：
    “一百多条船只已通过了我们的水闸。在最短期间内建造起来的这条绝妙的运河，是在共产党领导下，在伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志领导下，走向共产主义的我们人民的卓越的胜利。”
    列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的修建者都异口同声说：
    “我们要光荣地保持着代表忘我劳动范例的运河建造者的光荣传统！”
    修建运河的全体人员正在热烈地迎接运河通航的美妙日子。
