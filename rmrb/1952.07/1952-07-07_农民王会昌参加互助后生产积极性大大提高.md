    Farmer Wang Huichang's Enthusiasm for Production Greatly Increased After Joining Mutual Aid
    Editor: Wang Huichang, a strong and healthy young farmer of twenty-six or seven years old, lives in Dongguan Village, Quxian County, Hebei Province. He has eight mu of land, which is adjacent to my land. In previous years, I always saw weeds growing all over his field, so that it was hard to tell the difference between the weeds and the seedlings. His home is far from this piece of land, and the soil quality of this land is not good. After rain, the soil is so sticky that it cannot be hoed; when it is dry, the soil is so hard that it cannot be hoed. He simply couldn't take care of it all by himself. This spring, I saw that his land had been sown on time and had been hoed twice before wheat harvesting. At noon on the Dragon Boat Festival, I was resting under a willow tree at the edge of the field, and he came too. I asked him about it, and it turned out that he and eight other people in his village had formed a mutual aid group. He happily said, "This year I not only hoed the land well, but also opened up four mu of wasteland!" He told me that their mutual aid group completely assesses work points based on each person's farming skills, enthusiasm, speed, and quality of work, with daily self-reporting and public discussion, recording it in the books and then stamping it themselves, completely fairly and reasonably. As a result, everyone is working enthusiastically. He said, "We also plan to grow more grain to buy some new-style farm tools, and in the future, organize an agricultural producers' cooperative."

    农民王会昌参加互助后生产积极性大大提高
    编辑同志：河北曲周县东关村王会昌是个身强力壮、二十六七岁的青年。他有一块八亩大的耕地，和我的耕地相连。在往年，我总见他的地里长满了草，简直草、苗不分。他家离这块地很远，这块地的土质也不好，下了雨，土黏得不能锄，旱了，土硬的不能锄，他一人怎么也照顾不来。今年春天，我看见他的地已经按时播种了，割麦前已经锄了两遍。端午节晌午，我在地头柳树底下休息，他也来了。我问起他，原来他和他村里的另外八个人，成立了互助组。他高兴地说：“今年我不但锄好了地，还开了四亩荒地哩！”他告诉我，他这个互助组是完全根据各人的耕作技术、积极性、作的快慢好坏计工评分，每天自报公议，记上账以后自己盖章，完全公平合理。这么一来，大家都干得起劲。他说：“我们还打算多打粮食来买些新式农具，将来组织农业生产合作社。”    胡庆元
