Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 21st: General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side to the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, sent a letter to the other side on the 21st, demanding that the other side account for 101 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. These personnel are clearly listed as prisoners of war in the list forwarded by the International Committee of the Red Cross, but were not included in the list of prisoners of war submitted by the other side. General Nam Il pointed out that, together with the lists we have repeatedly submitted to the other side requesting explanations, there are 5,305 of our captured personnel for whom the other side has not provided any explanation, and demanded that the other side provide a responsible explanation without further delay. The full text of General Nam Il's letter to the other side is as follows:

To Major General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:

(1) Enclosed is a list of 101 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. These captured personnel of our side are all listed in the list of prisoners of war forwarded to our side by the International Committee of the Red Cross, but are not included in the list of prisoners of war submitted to our side. There is no doubt that these 101 Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel have been captured by your army and held as prisoners of war. Our side demands that your side provide a responsible explanation for this.

(2) Our side submitted a list of 203 people on July 1, 1952, a list of 4,391 people on July 14, and a list of 610 people on July 20, and today submitted a list of 101 people. These four lists include a total of 5,305 captured personnel of our side. Our side demands that your side provide a detailed and satisfactory explanation for these captured personnel of our side for whom you have never provided a true explanation.

(3) I would also like to point out that your side has not yet provided an explanation for the 44,205 captured personnel of our side whose names were submitted to your side on December 26, 1951.

    General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
            July 21, 1952

The administrative meeting of both delegations continued on the 21st.

    我方要求美方交代一百零一名志愿军战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判代表团我方首席代表南日将军二十一日致函对方，要求对方交代一百零一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。这些人员在红十字国际委员会转来的名单中已明确地列为战俘，但在对方交来战俘名单中却未列入。南日将军指出连同我方历次向对方提出要求交代的名单已有五千三百零五名我方被俘人员，对方未作任何交代，要求对方不再迟延地作负责的交代。南日将军致对方信件全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    （一）兹将一份一百零一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的名单随函提交你方。我方这些被俘人员均列于你方经过红十字国际委员会转交我方的战俘名单中，但并未列入你方提交我方的战俘名单中。毫无疑问这一百零一名中国人民志愿军人员已为你军所俘，并收容为战俘。我方要求你方对此作负责的交代。（二）我方于一九五二年七月一日提交二百零三人的名单，于七月十四日提交四千三百九十一人的名单，于七月二十日提交六百零十人的名单，今天又提交一百零一人的名单。这四项名单共计包括五千三百零五名我方被俘人员。我方要求你方对这些从未作过确实交代的我方被俘人员作详细与满意的交代。
    （三）我愿同时指出，对我方于一九五一年十二月二十六日向你方提交名单的四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员，你方至今尚未作过交代。
     朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
             代表团首席代表南日将军
             一九五二年七月二十一日
