Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting in London on June 27th. Prior to the three-foreign ministers meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and British Foreign Secretary Eden held three days of talks from the 24th to the 26th. After the three-foreign ministers meeting, Acheson again held separate talks with Eden and French Foreign Minister Schuman on the 28th. The United States convened this three-foreign ministers meeting after a long period of preparation, attempting to eliminate the growing contradictions between the United States and Britain and France on the Korean War and West German armament issues, as well as other issues, in order to advance the U.S. war plans in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, which have so far made slow progress. However, while the meeting was in progress, the contradictions among the United States, Britain, and France developed to a new peak, so the result of the meeting was that the U.S. goal was thwarted again.

Just as the three-foreign ministers meeting was about to open, the U.S. Air Force frantically bombed the Yalu River power plants in North Korea, which were non-military installations. This provocative act by the U.S. aggressors, aimed at breaking off the Korean armistice talks and expanding the war, caused intense panic and disputes within the ruling groups of Western European countries, and especially caused an "uproar" in the British Parliament, resulting in a serious crisis for the Churchill government, which was still slavishly following the U.S. aggression policy. Under these circumstances, Acheson had to "secretly meet" some British members of parliament the day before the official opening of the three-foreign ministers meeting to offer "explanations." According to a United Press New York dispatch on the 28th, "United Nations diplomats" admitted that the U.S. Air Force's bombing of the Yalu River power plants "is rapidly developing into one of the most serious misunderstandings between the United States and its allies on Far Eastern policy issues."

This situation obviously had a very unfavorable impact on the three-foreign ministers meeting. According to various sources, after five days of talks, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, in addition to agreeing to draft a note in response to the Soviet note on a German peace treaty, failed to make any important decisions on formulating war plans for the North Atlantic Group in Asia and the Middle East. Agence France-Presse, London, reported on the 27th that the three-foreign ministers meeting "does not seem to have made much progress on the issue of establishing some kind of organization in the Far East equivalent to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The United States and Britain and France have significant differences of opinion on the reply to the Soviet note of May 24th, which raised the issue of a German peace treaty. Since the Soviet Union's third note to the United States, Britain, and France reiterated the proposal that the four countries immediately hold negotiations on a German peace treaty and the unification of Germany, the Western countries have disregarded everything and signed the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty with the West German puppet government. Faced with the real threat of the revival of West German militarism, the people of Western European countries have become even more insistent that four-power negotiations be held according to the Soviet proposal. A considerable portion of the ruling groups in Western European countries, seeing the popular anger, also advocated holding four-power negotiations. At the end of May, one hundred Labour Party members in Britain submitted a proposal to Parliament requesting negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of German unification. Under these circumstances, the French and British governments dared not refuse the Soviet proposal any longer and expressed support for some form of four-power conference. The French and British governments thus clashed with the U.S. government, which insisted on opposing negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German issue.

This division between the United States and Britain and France became apparent in mid-June. The United States has constantly exerted pressure on the British and French governments, demanding that they agree with the U.S. view. According to a Reuters London dispatch, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson sent letters to Britain and France on June 12, reiterating U.S. opposition to direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. After this, the U.S. government held continuous talks with the French and British ambassadors to the United States in Washington. However, according to a Reuters London dispatch of June 21, "Washington has tried hard to reach an agreement on replying to the Soviet note concerning the future of Germany, but it has failed."

Thus, the issue had to be submitted to the three-foreign ministers meeting in London on June 27th for discussion. But the differences remained at the meeting. According to a United Press London dispatch on the 27th, British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Schuman again "advocated holding some kind of four-power conference to alleviate the parliamentary pressure their governments are under." Eden and Schuman "insisted on disagreeing with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's objections." After six hours of arguing, the three foreign ministers, in addition to agreeing to draft a note in response to the Soviet note, still could not express a clear consensus on the German issue. No matter how unwilling the United States, Britain, and France are to negotiate with the Soviet Union now, they cannot but repeatedly declare that the signing of the "General Treaty" does not mean that the door to negotiations is closed. Even if these are only hypocritical gestures, they still show that the Soviet Union's note advocating a peaceful solution to the German issue has become a tremendous political force, disrupting the ranks of the U.S., British, and French war alliance.

### 美国扩大侵略计划在三外长会议中受阻  三国对答复五月二十四日苏联照会问题发生很大争论

    美国扩大侵略计划在三外长会议中受阻
    三国对答复五月二十四日苏联照会问题发生很大争论
    【新华社二日讯】美、英、法三国外长于六月二十七日在伦敦举行会议。在三国外长会议以前，美国国务卿艾奇逊和英国外交大臣艾登曾于二十四日至二十六日举行了三天的会谈。在三国外长会议以后，艾奇逊又于二十八日分别与艾登及法国外交部长舒曼举行会谈。美国召开这次三国外长会议曾经经过长期的准备，企图在这次会议中消除美国与英、法两国间在朝鲜战争与西德武装问题上以及在其他问题上日益加剧的矛盾，以便推进美国在亚洲、欧洲与中东迄今进展迟缓的战争计划。但是，正在会议进行的时候，美、英、法三国之间的矛盾却发展到了新的高峰，因此会议的结果是美国的目的又落了空。
    正在三国外长会议快开幕的时候，美国空军疯狂地轰炸朝鲜非军事设备鸭绿江发电厂。美国侵略者这一企图破裂朝鲜停战谈判和扩大战争的挑衅行为，在西欧国家统治集团中引起了剧烈的恐慌和争吵，特别是在英国议会中引起了“轩然大波”，使正继续奴颜婢膝地追随美国侵略政策的邱吉尔政府因此遭到了严重的危机。在这种情形下，艾奇逊不得不在三外长会议正式开幕前一天“秘密会见”一些英国议员进行“解释”。据合众社纽约二十八日电透露：“联合国外交官”承认：美国空军轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的事件，“正迅速演变成美国及其盟国间在远东政策问题上最严重的误解之一”。
    这种情势显然直接对于三国外长会议产生了十分不利的影响。据各方消息透露，美、英、法三国外长经过为期五天的会谈，除了同意起草一个照会，答复苏联关于对德和约照会外，在制订北大西洋集团在亚洲与中东等地区的战争计划方面并没有能作出任何重要的决定。法新社伦敦二十七日电说：三国外长会议“在关于在远东建立某种等于北大西洋公约组织的机构的问题上，似乎未获得很大的进展。”
     【新华社二日讯】在答复苏联五月二十四日第三次就对德和约问题提出的照会上，美国与英、法两国之间发生很大的意见分歧。自从苏联第三次照会美、英、法三国再度建议四国立即举行关于对德和约和统一德国问题的谈判以后，西方国家不顾一切地与西德傀儡政府签订了“一般性条约”与“欧洲防务集团”条约。西欧各国人民在西德军国主义复活的现实威胁面前，要求根据苏联建议举行四国谈判的情绪已更趋强烈。西欧各国统治集团中也有相当一部分人鉴于群情愤激，而主张举行四国谈判，英国在五月底时即有一百名工党议员向议会提出提案，要求与苏联举行关于统一德国问题的谈判。在这种形势下，法国与英国政府也不敢再拒绝苏联的建议，而表示赞成举行某种形式的四国会议。法、英两国政府因此就与坚持反对与苏联谈判德国问题的美国政府发生了分歧。
    美国与英、法两国间的这种分歧，在六月中旬即趋表面化。美国曾不断对英、法两国政府施用压力，要它们同意美国的意见。据路透社伦敦电透露，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾在六月十二日致函英、法两国，重申美国反对与苏联直接谈判。在此以后，美国政府又曾在华盛顿与法英两国驻美大使不断举行会谈。但是，据路透社伦敦六月二十一日电透露：“华盛顿方面对于答复苏联有关德国前途的照会，曾努力想获致协议，但是已经失败了。”
    这样，问题不得不提交美、英、法三国外长六月二十七日在伦敦举行的会议去讨论。但是会上的分歧依然，据合众社伦敦二十七日电透露，英国外交大臣艾登与法国外交部长舒曼再次“主张举行某种四国会议，以减轻各该国政府所受到的议会的压力”。艾登和舒曼“坚持不赞成美国国务卿艾奇逊的反对意见”。三国外长经过了六小时的争吵，最后除了同意起草一个照会答复苏联照会之外，还是不能对德国问题表示明确的一致的意见。不论美英法方面现在如何地不愿与苏联进行谈判，但是现在它们不能不一再表示“一般性条约”的签字并不等于谈判之门已闭。即使这些只是虚伪的姿态，但却仍然说明了苏联主张和平解决德国问题的照会已成为一个巨大的政治力量，它已打乱了美英法战争同盟的阵脚。
