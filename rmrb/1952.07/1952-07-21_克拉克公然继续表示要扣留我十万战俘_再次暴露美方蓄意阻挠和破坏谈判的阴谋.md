Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 20th - The delegation representatives from both sides of the Panmunjom armistice talks held a brief thirteenth administrative meeting today. Although the content of the meeting has not been published since July 4th, it can be inferred from the persistence of the meeting, and especially from the US side's statements and actions outside the meeting, that the US representatives still have no sincerity in resolving the prisoner of war arrangement issue on a fair and reasonable basis. The statement made by the US Chief Representative Harrison on July 1st at the plenary meeting of the two delegations, in which he expressed his willingness to reach a reasonable agreement based on Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement, is likely just a means to delay the negotiations. At the July 1st meeting of the two delegations, Harrison stated that the US side "sincerely seeks an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea" and, for the first time, stopped repeating the bankrupt old tunes of so-called "screening" and "voluntary repatriation."

    However, the US side's performance outside the meeting these days has been a completely different attitude. What deserves special attention here is the absurd report submitted by Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations" forces, to the United Nations on July 13th. Nine days after the two delegations held an administrative meeting, Clark still repeated the already bankrupt lie that 100,000 of our captured personnel refused repatriation. In the report, Clark claimed that the figure of 100,000 was the result of the US side's "screening" of our captured personnel, and described this "screening" as "no procedure could be more humane, more just, and more aboveboard." Clark's report clearly has nothing new. People can recall that more than two months ago, when the US side proposed the unreasonable plan to forcibly detain 100,000 of our captured personnel, the then Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations" forces, Ridgway, also described this plan as "just and impartial." The US side also repeatedly claimed that this was the result of "screening" all of our captured personnel. However, the series of massacre incidents in the US prisoner of war camps in Koje Island, Busan, and Yeongcheon, and the heroic struggle of our captured personnel, exposed the US side's unprecedented bloody fraud of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The reactionary American publication "Time" magazine also admitted on June 2nd that the US side's unreasonable plan was created "confusedly" in a situation where it could not forcibly compel our captured personnel to refuse repatriation even with force. Now, Clark has actually picked up Ridgway's tattered hat, riddled with holes, to continue to cover up the US side's unreasonable demands. His fate will naturally be no better than Ridgway's. The Associated Press had already prepared a crisp slap in the face for Clark. The agency's Tokyo July 8th dispatch said, "It is known that at least 70,000 to 80,000 prisoners of war detained by the Allied forces are willing to return to the Communist side, and the number of anti-communist prisoners of war is slightly more than 70,000 to 80,000." And the American "Newsweek" magazine recently overturned the US side's repeated claim that 15,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel "refused repatriation," changing it to 14,000. The figures reported by the Associated Press and "Newsweek" are of course also fabricated by the US side, but this change in figures further exposes the conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war hidden behind these figures, and proves that Clark's claim that 100,000 of our captured personnel "refused repatriation" is nothing more than a doubly absurd fabrication. The fact that this fabrication was published during the administrative meetings convincingly proves that the US side has not abandoned its unreasonable demand to detain a large number of our captured personnel, and proves that the so-called "sincerity" in Harrison's mouth is completely hypocritical.

    The American aggressors not only openly continue to claim outside the meeting that they will detain a large number of our captured personnel, but have also begun to unilaterally take action without authorization. During the administrative meetings, the US side, ignoring our solemn warnings, illegally classified another 3,700 of our captured personnel as "Korean civilians" and handed them over to the Syngman Rhee gang. An Associated Press Tokyo dispatch on July 8th further revealed that the US side is preparing to expand this unilateral detention of prisoners of war, insisting on calling our captured personnel "anti-communist" elements and sending them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to serve as cannon fodder. The news said: Someone "unofficially" said, "North Korean anti-communist soldiers can stay in South Korea, and anti-communist Chinese soldiers can go to Taiwan to join the Kuomintang government," which nakedly exposes the American aggressors' deliberate conspiracy to detain our captured personnel and prepare to send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to serve as cannon fodder. And in order to realize this conspiracy, the American aggressors are stepping up the manufacture of so-called "anti-communist" elements with bayonets in their prisoner of war camps. According to materials disclosed by the US side, during the administrative meetings, more than 40 of our captured personnel were beaten to death or injured by the US side on Jeju Island, where Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel are detained, and in other US prisoner of war camps.

    It is obvious that the US side is now, on the one hand, using airplanes to bomb peaceful cities and facilities in an attempt to exert so-called "military pressure" on our side, and on the other hand, continuing to openly state that it will detain a large number of our captured personnel, and ignoring our warnings, continuing to unilaterally deal with prisoners of war, and continuing to massacre prisoners of war. This shows that the US side has not abandoned its dream of forcing our side to accept its unreasonable plan. In fact, both "military pressure" and the so-called "screening results" have long been proven to be worthless. This arrogant attitude of the US side only once again exposes its conspiracy to deliberately obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations.

### 克拉克公然继续表示要扣留我十万战俘  再次暴露美方蓄意阻挠和破坏谈判的阴谋

    克拉克公然继续表示要扣留我十万战俘
    再次暴露美方蓄意阻挠和破坏谈判的阴谋
   【新华社开城二十日电】板门店停战谈判双方代表团今天举行了历时短暂的第十三次行政性会议。虽然会议的内容自七月四日以来就一直没有发表，但是从会议的持久化，特别是从美方在会外的言论和行动看来，人们可以推断：美方代表仍无在公平合理基础上解决战俘安排问题的诚意。美方首席代表哈利逊七月一日在双方代表团大会上表示愿意根据停战协定草案第五十一款达成一个通情合理的协议的发言，很可能只是一种拖延谈判的手段。在七月一日的双方代表团大会上，哈利逊曾表示美方 “诚意地觅求停战，以终止朝鲜的流血”，并且第一次不再重弹那些已经证明破产了的所谓“甄别”和“自愿遣返”的老调。
    但是美方这些天来在会外的表现，却完全是另外的一种态度。这里值得特别注意的，是七月十三日“联合国”军总司令克拉克向联合国提出的一份荒谬报告。克拉克在双方代表团举行行政性会议九天之后，仍然把那早已破产的说什么有十万我方被俘人员拒绝遣返的谎言重述了一遍。克拉克在报告里宣称十万这个数字是美方对我方被俘人员进行了
    “甄别”的结果，并且把这种“甄别”说成是“不可能再有比这种手续更合乎人道、更公正、更磊落光明的手续”。克拉克的报告显然没有任何新的东西。人们可以回忆，两个多月以前，当美方提出强迫扣留我方十万被俘人员的无理方案的时候，当时的“联合国”军总司令李奇微也曾经把这个方案说成是“公正的、不偏不倚的”。美方并且一再宣称这是对我方全体被俘人员进行“甄别”的结果。但是巨济岛、釜山、永川等美方战俘营中发生的一连串屠杀事件和我方被俘人员的英勇斗争，拆穿了美方这个史无前例的强迫扣留战俘的血腥骗局。美国流行的反动刊物“时代”周刊也在六月二日承认：美方这个无理方案，是在虽然用武力也无法强迫我方被俘人员拒绝遣返的情况下“糊里糊涂”地制造出来的。现在，克拉克居然又拾起了李奇微这顶千绽百孔的破帽子，来继续为美方的无理要求遮羞。他的命运自然也并不比李奇微要好些。美联社早就给克拉克准备好了一记清脆的耳光。该社东京七月八日的消息说，“联军拘留的战俘已知至少有七八万人是愿意返回共方的，属于反共战俘一类的比七八万人的数目略微多一点。”而美国的“新闻周刊”最近也推翻了从前美方一再声称的有一万五千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的说法，改说成一万四千名了。美联社和“新闻周刊”所报道的数字当然也是美方捏造出来的，但这种数字的改变却更加暴露了掩藏在这些数字后面的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，并且证明了克拉克所谓十万我方被俘人员 “拒绝遣返”的说法，不过是一个双倍荒谬的捏造而已。这种捏造竟然在双方进入行政性会议期间发表出来，就令人信服地证明美方并未放弃它的大批扣留我方被俘人员的无理主张，证明哈利逊口中的所谓“诚意”，完全是口是心非的。 美国侵略者不但公然在会外继续宣称要扣留大批我方被俘人员，并已开始片面地擅自采取行动。就在行政性会议期间，美方不顾我方的郑重警告，又将三千七百名我方被俘人员非法地分类为“朝鲜平民”，移交给李承晚匪帮。美联社东京八日电还进一步透露：美方准备扩大这种片面扣留战俘的行为，硬把我方被俘人员说成是“反共”分子，把他们送给蒋介石、李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。这个消息说：有人“非正式地”说，“北朝鲜的反共士兵可以留在南朝鲜，反共的中国士兵可以到台湾参加国民党政府那一边”，这就赤裸裸地暴露了美国侵略者蓄意扣留我方被俘人员，准备把他们送交蒋介石、李承晚匪帮充当炮灰的无耻阴谋。而为了实现这个阴谋，美国侵略者正在他们的战俘营里加紧用刺刀制造所谓“反共”分子。根据美方透露的材料，就在行政性会议期间，在拘留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的济州岛上和其他美方战俘营中，又有四十多名我方被俘人员被美方打死打伤。
    显而易见，美方现在在会外一方面用飞机对和平城市和设备狂轰滥炸，企图对我方施用所谓“军事压力”，一方面继续公然表示要大批扣留我方被俘人员，并且不顾我方警告，继续片面处理战俘，并继续屠杀战俘，这说明美方并未放弃强迫我方接受它的无理方案的梦想。其实，无论“军事压力”也好，所谓“甄别结果”也好，早就被证明了是一文不值的东西。美方这种狂妄态度，只是再一次暴露了它的蓄意阻挠和破坏停战谈判的阴谋而已。
