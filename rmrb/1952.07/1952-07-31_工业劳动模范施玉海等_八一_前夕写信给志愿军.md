    Industrial Labor Models Shi Yuhai and Others Write to the Volunteers on the Eve of "August 1st"
    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: We are all coal miners from across the country, recuperating at the Beidaihe Seaside Coal Mine Workers' Sanatorium. Here, we feel boundless happiness and glory. The food, lodging, and entertainment are all satisfactory. Such a fulfilling life was something we never dreamed of in the past, under the whips and pickaxe handles of the bureaucratic capitalists and feudal bosses, but today it has all become a reality. This is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the result of your victory over American imperialism on the Korean front and the safeguarding of our national security.
    Comrades, we know that just as the people of the motherland are willing to hear your victory news, you also like to hear the good news of the victories of the people of the motherland in peaceful construction. Therefore, after we return to the mines, we guarantee to further unite all workers, intensify production, and strive to support you. First, we will disseminate the advanced production experience we have learned from each other during our recuperation, and then formulate group production plans based on the overall production tasks of each mine. In the production process, we must strictly abide by and check the safe production system, and strive to avoid fatal accidents. At the same time, we will discuss and study with everyone how to adjust the labor organization, find tricks, and fully utilize the potential of all labor organizations and production tools to increase output and quality, and vigorously support you.
    The 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, "August 1st" Army Day, is coming soon. On this great holiday, we wish you more victories. The people of the motherland will also bring you more good news on the production front. Victory echoes victory, confidence encourages confidence, let us work together for the great cause of the people of the motherland!
    Industrial Labor Models Shi Yuhai, Zhang Zifu, Liu Jiuxue,
    Ma Liuha, Feng Xuran, and all recuperating workers at the Beidaihe Seaside Coal Mine
    Workers' Sanatorium

    工业劳动模范施玉海等“八一”前夕写信给志愿军
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：我们都是来自全国各地，在北戴河海滨煤矿工人休养院休养的煤矿工人。在这里，我们感到无限的幸福和光荣。吃的，住的，玩的，一切都称心满意。这种美满的生活，过去，在官僚资本家和封建把头的皮鞭和镐柄的抽打下，我们做梦也没有梦到过，但今天却全成了事实。这是由于毛主席和共产党的英明领导，由于你们在朝鲜前线战胜了美帝国主义、保卫祖国安全的结果。
    同志们，我们知道，如同祖国人民愿意听到你们的胜利消息一样，你们也喜欢听到祖国人民在和平建设上的胜利捷报。因此，在我们回到矿山以后，保证进一步团结全体工人，加紧生产，努力支援你们。首先，我们要把在休养期间互相学到的先进生产经验向大家传播，再根据各矿总的生产任务，订出小组的生产计划。在生产过程中，要严格遵守和检查安全生产制度，争取不发生死亡事故，同时和大家讨论研究调整劳动组织，寻找窍门，把一切劳动组织和生产工具的潜在能力充分发挥起来，提高产量和质量，大力支援你们。
    中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年就到来了。在这伟大的节日里，祝你们取得更多的胜利。祖国人民在生产战线上也将会带给你们更多的捷报。胜利呼应着胜利，信心鼓舞着信心，让咱们共同为祖国人民的伟大事业更好好地努力吧。
