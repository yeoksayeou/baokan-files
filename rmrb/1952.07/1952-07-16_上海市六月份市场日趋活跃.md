Following the East China Region's Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference, which facilitated trade relations between urban and rural areas and among different regions, the market situation in Shanghai became increasingly active in June. Sixteen industrial sectors in Shanghai participating in the exchange exceeded their sales plans, thereby resolving the working capital turnover problems of private enterprises (especially small and medium-sized industries). During and after the conference, some factories that had suspended operations during the off-season began to resume work one after another. For example, more than 400 small factories in the cutlery and scissors industry, more than 30 factories in the stationery and educational supplies ball manufacturing group, and various shoe manufacturing factories have all recently fully resumed operations.

In the commercial sector, fifty-four native product industries participating in the exchange restored or established new commercial relationships with various regions, and their business operations achieved significant development. The business situation of other commercial sectors besides native products also began to improve in June.

The number of private merchants going to the countryside to purchase goods increased significantly compared to before. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, the purchasing funds going to the countryside in the first and middle ten days of June increased by more than 90% compared to the same period in May.

    上海市六月份市场日趋活跃
    华东区经过城乡物资交流大会沟通城乡和各地区贸易关系后，上海市六月份市场情况日趋活跃。上海市参加交流的十六个工业行业超额完成了销售计划，因而使得私营厂商（特别是中小工业）的生产资金周转问题得到解决。大会期中和大会闭幕以后，部分在淡季中停工的工厂开始陆续复工，如刀剪业四百余家小型厂、文教工业制球组三十余家工厂、制鞋业各厂都在最近全面开工。
    在商业方面，参加交流的五十四个土产行业和各地恢复或建立了新的商业关系，业务获得显著的开展。土产以外的各商业六月份营业情况也都开始见好。
    私商下乡采购者较前显著增多。据市人民政府工商局统计，六月上、中两旬下乡的采购资金较五月同期增加百分之九十以上。
