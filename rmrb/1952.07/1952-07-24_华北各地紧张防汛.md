Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. People in various river basins of North China are stepping up flood prevention efforts. Since July, rainfall has occurred successively in various parts of North China, and the Yellow River, Zhang River, Ziya River, Yongding River and other rivers have been rising; on July 9, the water level at Guantai (i.e., Liuhegou, northwest of Anyang) on the Zhang River rose sharply, and the flow rate suddenly increased to 1,406 cubic meters per second, exceeding the guaranteed flow rate. Currently, continuous rain is occurring again in various parts of North China. In order to ensure increased agricultural production, people in various places have launched intensive flood prevention work. In some parts of Hebei Province, flood prevention organizations have already been deployed on the embankments for defense; some places are launching competitions for flood prevention and embankment protection. After issuing instructions on flood prevention work for the Yellow River in early July, Pingyuan Province also convened a provincial flood prevention and waterlogging prevention conference to deploy flood prevention work throughout the province.

    华北各地紧张防汛
    【新华社二十三日讯】华北各河流域人民正加紧防汛。七月以来，华北各地先后落雨，黄河、漳河、子牙河、永定河等河都在上涨；七月九日漳河观台（即六河沟，在安阳西北）水位陡涨，流量骤增到一千四百零六秒公方，超过了保证流量。目前，华北各地又霪雨连绵。为了保证农业增产，各地人民已展开了紧张的防汛工作。河北省有些地方的防汛组织已经上堤防守；有些地方正展开防汛护堤的竞赛。平原省在七月初发出黄河防汛工作指示后，又召开了全省的防汛防涝会议，布置了全省的防汛工作。
