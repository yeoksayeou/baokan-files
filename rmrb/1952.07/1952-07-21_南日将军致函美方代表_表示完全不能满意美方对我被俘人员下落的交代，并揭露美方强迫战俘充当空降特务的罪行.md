Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 20th: General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side in the Korean Armistice Negotiations, sent a letter to the opposing side on the 20th, pointing out that the so-called explanation in the opponent's letter of July 17th regarding the whereabouts of 1,014 of our captured personnel is completely unsatisfactory. General Nam Il also exposed the opponent's illegal and criminal act of forcing our captured personnel to serve as airborne spies. In the opponent's letter of July 17th, no explanation whatsoever was given for the whereabouts of 610 of our captured personnel. Particularly absurd is that regarding the 52 of our captured personnel who were included in the POW list submitted by the other side on December 18th of last year but were removed from the list submitted by the other side on January 28th of this year, the other side claimed in the letter that 13 of them had escaped, while the escape dates provided were all after January 28th, 1952. In fact, many of these 13 Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel had been forced by the other side to airdrop into our area to carry out espionage work. Among them were Wang Jiati, Tan Guangqing, Zhang Wenrong, Tan Wenyao, and Li Xingshun. After entering our area, they had already confessed in detail to our side the process of being forced to perform espionage work and the various criminal activities carried out by the other side against our captured personnel in the POW camps. The other side is unable to explain the whereabouts of these personnel but instead fabricates clumsy and contradictory lies out of thin air. This once again proves the opponent's conspiracy to detain our captured personnel. The full text of General Nam Il's letter to the opposing side is as follows:

To Major General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of July 17th regarding the whereabouts of 1,014 of our captured personnel has been received.

(1) The 52 of our captured personnel in the first list were included by your side in the POW list submitted by your side on December 18th, 1951, but were removed from the list submitted by your side on January 28th, 1952. In your letter of July 17th, you claimed that 13 of these 52 of our captured personnel had escaped. However, the escape dates you provided for these 13 of our captured personnel are all after January 28th, 1952, which clearly indicates that your claim of escape is not true. In fact, our side possesses undeniable materials that fully prove that many of these 13 of our captured personnel were forced by your side to airdrop into our area to carry out espionage work. They have already confessed to our side and reported in detail the process by which your side forced them to perform espionage work. You must bear full responsibility for this serious violation of international law in forcing prisoners of war to perform espionage work.

(2) The 182 of our captured personnel in the second list are duplicates in the list submitted by your side on January 28th. In your letter, you made no explanation whatsoever regarding the issue of the discrepancy between the total number of names and the actual number of names in the list, which arose due to the duplication of these 182 names.

(3) The 780 of our captured personnel in the third list had written letters home through your side, but your side did not include them in the POW list submitted by your side. In your letter, you claimed that the names of 414 of them did not match the detention numbers in your POW camps, or that they had no detention numbers, and therefore no explanation was given for these 414 people. It must be pointed out that our side provided detention numbers only for your reference in inquiries. However, your side must not refuse to provide a responsible explanation for our captured personnel based on the detention numbers compiled by your side. Based on the above reasons, your side has not provided any explanation at all for 610 of our captured personnel. Enclosed is a list of 428 of our captured personnel. We once again request that your side provide a responsible explanation, and we request that your side provide a responsible explanation for the issue of the discrepancy of 182 names between the total number of names and the actual number of names in the list submitted on January 28th.

        General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the
        Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation
                July 20, 1952

On the 20th, the delegations of both sides continued to hold administrative meetings to discuss the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war.

    南日将军致函美方代表
    表示完全不能满意美方对我被俘人员下落的交代，并揭露美方强迫战俘充当空降特务的罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军二十日致函对方，指出：对方在七月十七日的来信中对于一千零十四名我方被俘人员下落的所谓交代，是完全不能令人满意的。南日将军并揭露了对方强迫我方被俘人员作空降特务的非法罪恶行为。对方在七月十七日的来信中，对于六百零十名我方被俘人员根本没有作任何交代。特别荒谬的是对于五十二名列入对方去年十二月十八日交来战俘名单中，而为对方在今年一月二十八日交来名单中所除名的我方被俘人员，对方在来信中声称，其中十三名逃亡，而同时提出的逃亡日期却都在一九五二年一月二十八日以后。事实上这十三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员中有许多名曾在对方强迫下空降到我方地区作特务工作。其中包括王家悌、谭广清、张文荣、谈文耀、李兴顺。他们在进入我方地区后，早已向我方详细地坦白了被迫担任特务工作的经过和对方在战俘营中对我方被俘人员所进行的各种罪恶活动。对方无法交代这些人员的下落，却凭空捏造出自相矛盾的拙劣谎言。这再一次的证明了对方企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。南日将军致对方信件的全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    你在七月十七日关于一千零十四名我方被俘人员下落的来信已经收到。
    （一）第一份名单中五十二名我方被俘人员，是你方列入了你方在一九五一年十二月十八日交来的战俘名单中，而为你方一九五二年一月二十八日交来名单中所除去者。你在七月十七日的来信中声称，这五十二名我方被俘人员中有十三名逃亡。但你所提出的这十三名我方被俘人员的逃亡日期，却都在一九五二年一月二十八日以后，显然你方所称逃亡并非事实。事实上我方握有不容抵赖的材料完全地证明这十三名我方被俘人员中，有许多名曾在你方强迫之下，被你方空降到我方地区作特务工作。他们早已向我方坦白，详细地报告了你方强迫他们作特务工作的经过。对于这种强迫战俘作特务工作的严重违反国际法的行为，你方必须负完全的责任。
    （二）第二份名单中一百八十二名我方被俘人员，是你方一月二十八日交来名单中本身重复者。你在来信中对于因这一百八十二人姓名之重复而产生的你方所称名单总数与名单中姓名实数不符的问题，根本没有作任何交代。
    （三）第三份名单中，七百八十名我方被俘人员曾经通过你方写信回家，但你方却没有将他们列入你方交来的战俘名单中。你在来信中声称其中四百十四人的姓名与你方战俘营拘留编号不符，或没有拘留编号，因而对于这四百十四人未作交代。必须指出我方提出拘留编号，只是为了你方查询中的参考。但你方决不能根据你方所编排的拘留编号，而拒绝对我方被俘人员作负责的交代。根据以上理由，你方对于六百零十名我方被俘人员根本未作任何交代，随函提交四百二十八名我方被俘人员的名单，再次要求你方作负责交代，并要求你方对于一月二十八日交来名单总数与实际姓名不符一百八十二名的问题，作负责的交代。
        朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
            代表团首席代表南日将军
                一九五二年七月二十日
    二十日双方代表团大会继续进行行政性会议，讨论战俘遣返问题。
