    West of Zheduo Mountain
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qian Feng

    West of Zheduo Mountain lies the vast, thousand-mile expanse of the Western Kang Plateau. Nearly 500,000 Tibetan compatriots in the entire province mostly reside on this large plateau, suitable for both agriculture and animal husbandry.

    Leaving Kangding South Gate, we unknowingly arrived at the eastern foot of Zheduo Mountain. Zheduo Mountain stands at 4,700 meters above sea level, one-third higher than Erlang Mountain, but the ascent and descent are all gentle slopes, making the drive easier than crossing Erlang Mountain.

    Near the summit, there is a stone pile formed of disordered rocks. Passing Tibetans must respectfully kowtow here before proceeding. Initially, we couldn’t quite understand this, but after digging through the snow on the pile, we found many stones engraved with incomplete scriptures.

    In the Tibetan language, “Zhe” means “ghost,” so Zheduo means “many ghosts.” Most Tibetan compatriots are superstitious about ghosts and gods, so kneeling and praying over scriptures in this deep mountain is probably like many people in the interior kowtowing to Bodhisattvas before traveling, carrying a sense of praying for the safety of people and livestock.

    Zheduo Mountain is covered with clouds of snow, stretching like a giant silver dinosaur from north to south, with a very majestic momentum.

    We began descending the mountain at 7 p.m. At this time, in the eastern coastal provinces, it would have been dark for quite a while, but here the brilliant sun still lingered on the horizon.

    The sun shone on the thick white snow, with the mountains reflecting dazzling light.

    After descending, we arrived at a Tibetan village of more than twenty households, called Yingguanzhai.

    Upon entering the village, we saw a newly erected pine branch archway, as the Muyu District Government of Kangding County is located here. The district government staff were busy arranging the New Year venue, and women were pasting beautiful lace on each portrait of the leaders.

    All the staff are Tibetans, and they vacated their bunks for us to stay in. Unfortunately, the strong feelings of hospitality on both sides could not be fully expressed through words, and sometimes we had to use hand gestures to communicate.

    Tibetan houses are generally divided into two floors, with the upper floor for living and the lower floor for raising livestock. Because most houses do not have formal windows, but only a hole dug in the wall to circulate air, each house looks like a bunker from the outside, so Han people commonly call them blockhouses. Many of our companions were entertained overnight in these bunker-shaped houses, and the next day they all unanimously praised their hosts for their ability to go up and down the stairs. It turns out that most Tibetan houses do not have stairs, but only rely on a tree trunk carved with serrations to go up and down. Friends from the interior are uneasy when climbing such stairs, but Tibetans are accustomed to it. They carry buckets on their backs, put their hands on their waists, and walk up and down with nimble steps. The elderly and children are equally unafraid.

    At the head of Yingguanzhai village, we saw herds of black yaks for the first time, driven back to the village by a young herdsman. Yaks are the main draught animals and means of transportation in Tibetan areas. In the past and present, there have been tens of thousands of yaks braving wind and snow on the transportation lines between Lhasa and Ganzi, transporting large quantities of materials to the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet. Before the entire Kangzang Highway under construction is open to traffic, they will still be the main means of transportation between Tibet and the interior.

    The shape of the yak is not similar to the yellow cattle or buffalo in the interior. Its most notable feature is: short body and short legs, the tail is scattered like a horse's tail, and the whole body is covered with long and dense hair. This kind of yak is not only suitable for long-distance travel like mules and horses, but also can carry heavy loads over mountains. The herdsman told us that his yaks can use their heads to push through the snow after the mountains are closed by heavy snow. In this case, it is common to not eat grass for a day or two. But he said that this would never affect the health of the yak, let alone cause death. It sounded like a magical story to us.

    This herdsman had participated in the transportation work to support the liberation of Tibet. The fact that the People's Liberation Army loves Tibetan compatriots obviously left a deep impression on his mind. He repeatedly gave us a thumbs up, telling us:
    "Chairman Mao's troops, Ya Mu Ya Mu!" (Ya Mu Ya Mu means very good)

    From Yingguanzhai westward, we have been advancing in the flat river valley. The width of the river valley is more than ten miles, the soil is fertile, and the river water is gurgling. On both sides of the river valley, the mountains are rarely steep, and mostly are layers of loess suitable for cultivation. At this time of year, it was the end of the severe cold month of December, but the sun shone gently, and the climate was similar to winter in the Huai River basin. Before we arrived at the Western Kang Plateau, we always imagined everything here to be so cold, but the reality was completely different.

    At noon, we passed Tagong Temple. Tagong Temple is a famous large Lama temple in Kangding, with a wide area and magnificent buildings. It is a pity that we did not have time to stop, but just looking at its golden roof and red walls from the outside, we can know that the origin of this temple is not shallow.

    Behind Tagong Temple is a flat pasture. Under the transparent blue sky, the golden grassland, black yaks, and brownish-yellow tents created an unexpected beautiful scenery. We often heard melodious pastoral songs blurted out by young Tibetan women. Although the lyrics were unusually short, the affection was very profound. One of them was roughly like this:
    "We miss Chairman Mao,
    Many high mountains separate us,
    We want to shout loudly,
    But we are afraid that the sound will be blown away by the wind."

    After passing the pasture, the road slowly extended into a primeval forest. The types of trees are mostly pine, fir, and cypress, which are generally several feet high and thick enough to encircle. The dense branches and leaves are like an endless green lid, and the sun only leaks in scattered light from the gaps. There are many wild chickens in the forest, with two kinds of white and colored, in groups of hundreds, and generally larger than domestic chickens.

    We passed through the primeval forest and entered a wide river valley again, arriving at Daofu County in the evening.

    折多山的西边
    新华社记者  千峰
    折多山的西边，是纵横千里的西康高原。全省将近五十万的藏族同胞，大部分都聚居在这个宜耕宜牧的大高原上。
    我们出了康定南关，不知就已经是到了折多山的东麓。折多山拔海四千七百公尺，比二郎山还要高出三分之一，但上山下山全都是漫坡，所以汽车走起来比过二郎山时还要容易。
    将近山顶有一座乱石堆成的石堆，过往的藏人经过这里，都必恭必敬地叩头以后才能他去。我们看了最初有些不能理解，以后用手扒开石堆上的积雪，原来许多石头刻着残缺不全的经文。
    在藏语中折字当作鬼字解释，折多就是鬼多。一般藏族同胞迷信鬼神，大概在此深山中跪拜经文，是和内地过去许多人出门跪拜菩萨一样，带有一种祈求人畜平安的意思。
    折多山上覆盖着连云的积雪，像一条巨大的银色的恐龙由北向南伸展，气势非常雄壮。
    我们在下午七点钟开始下山。这时在东部沿海的省份，早已天黑了一大会儿，但这里灿烂的太阳却仍旧留在地平线上。
    太阳照着厚厚的白雪，遍山反射着刺眼的光芒。
    下山以后到了一个二十多户人家的藏族村落，地名叫营管寨。
    一进村口我们就看到一个新扎起来的松枝牌坊，原来康定县的木雅区区政府设在这里。区政府的工作人员正忙着布置新年会场，妇女们在每张领袖像上粘贴着美丽的花边。
    所有的工作人员都是藏人，他们把自己的铺位腾出来给我们住宿，可惜主客两方面的浓情盛意都不能全部通过言语来表达，有时我们不得不用手式比划着来说话。
    藏族人家的房屋一般分上下两层，上层住人，下层饲养牲畜。因为大部分的房子都没有正式窗户，只是从墙上挖开一个洞口流通空气，从外部看去每座都像一座碉堡，所以一般汉人普通称为碉房。我们同行的许多人被招待在这些碉堡形的房子里过了一夜，第二天都不约而同的夸耀着自己的房主如何如何具有上下楼的本领。原来藏族同胞的房屋大多没有楼梯，而只靠了一根刻着锯齿的树干上下。从内地来的朋友上下这种阶梯莫不心里惴惴不安，然而一般藏人却习以为常，他们和她们背上背着水桶，两手插在腰里用着轻捷的步子走上走下。老人和小孩也一样没有半点恐惧。
    在营管寨的村头上我们第一次看到了成群的黑色的牦牛，它们被一个年轻的牧民赶回村庄。牦牛在藏族地区是主要的耕畜和运输工具，过去和现在都有成千上万的牦牛不避风雪的跋涉在拉萨和甘孜间的运输线上，它们给进入西藏的人民解放军和工作人员运送了大量物资。在修筑中的康藏公路全线通车以前，它们仍将担当着西藏和内地的主要交通工具。
    牦牛的形状和内地的黄牛或水牛都不相似。它最显著的特点是：身长腿短，尾部像马尾似的散着，全身被着又长又密的耗毛。这种牦牛不仅和骡马一样适于长途跋涉，而且还能驮着重载翻山越岭。牧民告诉我们他的牦牛在大雪封山之后能够用头拨着雪前进，在这种情况，一两天吃不到草是常有的事。但他说这绝不会影响到牦牛的健康，更不会因此死亡。我们听来真像一个神奇的故事。
    这个牧民曾经参予了支援解放西藏的运输工作，解放军爱护藏族同胞的事实，显然在他脑子里留下了深刻的印象，他屡屡伸出大拇指，告诉我们：
    “毛主席的队伍，亚母亚母！”（亚母亚母是很好的意思）
    从营管寨向西，我们一直在平坦的大川里前进。川的宽度有的达十余里，土壤肥沃，河水淙淙。川的两旁，山势也很少险峻的样子，且多为宜于耕种的黄土层。这时论季节已到了严寒的十二月末尾，但太阳却温柔地照耀着，气候几与淮河流域的冬天相似。我们在未到达西康高原以前，总往往把这里的一切地方都想像得那末寒冷，实际则完全不然。
    中午过塔公寺。塔公寺是康定境内有名的大喇嘛庙，面积宽广，屋宇宏丽，我们可惜来不及停车，但仅从外面看看它那金顶红墙的建筑，就可知道这座寺院的来历有些不浅。
    塔公寺后是一片坦平的大牧场，在蔚蓝得透明的天际下，金黄色的草丛，黑色的牦牛，褐黄的帐幕，使人有意想不到的美景。我们时常听到婉转的牧歌在年轻的藏女中脱口而出，词句虽然异常简短，但情意非常深长。其中一首大意是这样：
    “我们想念毛主席，
    许多高山把我们隔断，
    我们想高声叫喊，
    又怕声音被风吹散。”
    过了牧场再向前走，公路慢慢伸进一个原始大森林里。树的种类多松杉和扁柏，普通都高达数丈，粗可合围，浓密的枝叶像一个无边无际的绿色的盖子，太阳只是从间隙里泄进零零星星的光芒。树林里野鸡很多，有白色和花色两种，每群以数百计，普通都比家鸡还大。
    我们穿过原始森林再进入一个宽阔的大川，于黄昏时分到达道孚县城。
