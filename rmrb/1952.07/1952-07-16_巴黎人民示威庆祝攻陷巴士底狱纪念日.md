Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 15th: According to TASS, July 14th was the anniversary of the French people's storming of the Bastille. The working people of Paris held their annual large-scale demonstration under the slogans of defending peace, freedom, and democracy to celebrate this joyous national holiday.

    At three o'clock in the afternoon, demonstrators formed neat ranks and marched from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation. Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the French Communist Party, who was recently released from prison, walked at the front of the procession. Upon reaching the destination, Thorez left the ranks and ascended the reviewing stand, which immediately sparked cheers in the square. Marty, Florin, Fajon, Chomat, General Petit, Vigier, and other leaders of French democratic public opinion also went up to the reviewing stand.

    The demonstration队伍 (duìwǔ, ranks, troops) held up portraits of Thorez, Duclos, Stie, and Henri Martin, along with banners that read: "Release Stie! Release Henri Martin! Freedom-loving people will never allow their sons to be tortured in prison!"

    The working people of Aubervilliers, Montreuil, Ivry, Saint-Denis, and many other places in the suburbs of Paris marched past the reviewing stand, singing the Marseillaise. They shouted slogans: "No fascism! We must defend freedom!"

    Delegations from the working people of Britain and Italy participated in the demonstration. They held up banners declaring that the people of Britain and Italy stood united with the people of France.

    Representatives of the Vietnamese working people marched past the reviewing stand with banners reading: "Peace for Vietnam! Peaceful negotiations with Ho Chi Minh!" Algerian workers marched past the reviewing stand with banners reading: "Long live the solidarity of the Algerian and French people!" "Down with racial discrimination!" "We want independence!"

    French women held up banners that read: "Mothers unite to save peace!" The ranks of the French Union of Young Women held high the portraits of the French heroine Casanova, who sacrificed herself for the country, and the Soviet heroine Zoya. Teams of athletes, students, and children shouted: "We want to study in peace and freedom!" "We want sports fields, not cannons!" Teams of writers, artists, actors, and filmmakers also carried large banners demanding the release of patriots as they marched past the reviewing stand.
