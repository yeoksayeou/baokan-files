Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 13th: The fighting in the east-central sector was most intense from July 6th to 10th. A two-day mountain battle occurred there, with our infantry, supported by heavy artillery fire, thwarting the invading enemy. On the 7th, the U.S. invading army drove two companies of puppet troops to attack a position of our army southeast of Kimhwa. Our small defending unit inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and then retreated into tunnel fortifications to continue fighting, preventing the enemy troops who had climbed the mountain from gaining a stable foothold. On the night of the second day, our army bombarded these enemy troops with fierce artillery fire, and then an infantry unit launched a strong counterattack. This unit, with the cooperation of the brave soldiers defending the tunnels, quickly recovered the mountain position, eliminating a large number of enemy troops. Although the enemy then launched more than ten consecutive counterattacks with six platoons of troops, they were all repulsed by our army. In two days of fighting, our army killed or wounded nearly 500 enemy troops. In the area east of Kimhwa, another unit of our army killed or wounded more than 130 officers and soldiers of the Rhee puppet army in a counterattack on the 7th.

On the 9th, five companies of enemy troops, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked a mountain position of our army south of Kosong on the east coast, encountering strong fire resistance from our army. In more than eight hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's multiple charges were repulsed. Our army killed or wounded more than 690 enemy troops and captured more than 100 various guns. On the 10th, a battalion of the U.S. 45th Division on the western front was severely attacked by our army while attacking a position of our army northwest of Chorwon. The enemy suffered more than 230 casualties and retreated in defeat.

Recently, our infantry and artillery have adopted various effective tactics to destroy and damage many enemy tanks. On the 6th alone, our infantry destroyed six enemy tanks with landmines. On the 10th, nine enemy tanks harassed our forward positions six kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, and five were destroyed and three damaged by accurate fire from our artillery. When the enemy used tractors to tow away the wreckage of the tanks, one was also destroyed by our artillery fire. Our army also destroyed a tank hidden deep in the enemy's positions with long-range artillery fire. On this day, our army destroyed or damaged a total of nine enemy tanks and one tractor in this area, consuming only twenty-six artillery shells and ten rocket-propelled grenades.

    朝中人民部队继续击退敌军进犯
    五天歼敌千五百余名并毁伤许多敌军战车
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】自七月六日到十日，在中线偏东地区的战斗最激烈。那里发生一个延续两天的山地争夺战，我军步兵在强大炮火配合下挫败了进犯的敌人。七日，美国侵略军驱使两个连伪军向金城东南我军的一处阵地进犯。我小队守军杀伤许多敌人后退入坑道工事继续战斗，使爬上山头的敌军不能安稳地站住脚跟。第二日夜间，我军用猛烈炮火轰击这股敌军，然后一支步兵部队就发起强力反击。这支部队在坚守坑道的勇士们的配合下很快地收复了这个山头阵地，歼灭了大批敌军。此后敌军虽然又用六个排兵力连续反扑十多次，但都被我军击退。两天战斗，我军共毙伤敌军近五百名。在金城以东地区，我军另一支部队在七日的一次反击战中毙伤李伪军官兵一百三十多名。
    九日，敌军五个连在炮火掩护下向东海岸高城以南我军一处山头阵地进犯，遭到我军坚强的火力阻击。在八个多小时激战中，敌军多次冲锋都被击溃。我军杀伤敌军六百九十多名，缴获各种枪一百多枝。十日，西线美军第四十五师的一个营，在进犯铁原西北我军的一处阵地时遭我军痛击，该敌伤亡二百三十多名后溃退。
    最近我军步兵和炮兵采取各种有效的战术击毁击伤了许多敌军战车。在六日一天中，我军步兵用地雷炸毁了敌军六辆战车。十日，敌军九辆战车窜扰我军板门店东北六公里处的前沿阵地，被我军炮兵以准确火力击毁五辆，击伤三辆。敌军用牵引机来拖战车残骸时，也被我军炮火击毁了一辆。我军并以远射程炮火击毁了一辆藏在敌军阵地纵深的战车。我军这一天在该地区共击毁击伤敌军九辆战车和一辆牵引车，自己仅消耗二十六发炮弹和十发火箭筒弹。
