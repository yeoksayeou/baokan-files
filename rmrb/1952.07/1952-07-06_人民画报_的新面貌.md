    A New Look for "People's Pictorial"
    Quewen

    "People's Pictorial" is the only comprehensive large-scale pictorial in the country. Over the past two years, its circulation and the number of readers at home and abroad have been continuously increasing. It has achieved certain successes in reflecting China's various social reforms and economic construction, as well as reporting various new things.

    However, in the past, "People's Pictorial" still had some shortcomings in terms of content, layout, and printing. The content was often not systematic and complete enough, the pictures were not selected carefully enough, and the text descriptions were not concise and comprehensive enough; the layout appeared fragmented and crowded; and the printing was not refined enough.

    In order to better reflect the achievements of the new China's political, economic, and cultural construction, and to further meet the needs of the increasing number of readers at home and abroad, especially the needs of foreign readers, "People's Pictorial" began to improve its content and form starting with the June issue of this year. In terms of content, it will reduce general news materials and focus on reporting the various constructions of the new China, the political, economic, and cultural life of workers and peasants, scientific achievements, magnificent rivers and mountains, and rich products, as well as the growth of the international forces for defending peace. In terms of editorial policy, it will strengthen the ideological and artistic aspects of reporting in order to widely meet the needs of the people at home, overseas Chinese, the people of various fraternal countries, and people of all strata in capitalist countries.

    "People's Pictorial" met the readers with a new look in its June issue. This issue featured photos of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in a prominent space, vividly reflecting the major events of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions in defending the cause of peace.

    The photos commemorating the world's four great cultural figures illustrated the Chinese people's emphasis on the great cultural heritage and their respect and love for the four great cultural figures who worked for the progress of human society. The photos of Beijing children celebrating the "June 1st" International Children's Day demonstrated the happiness and joy of the new China's children, reflecting the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's love and care for children.

    This issue of the pictorial also published a large number of photos reflecting the construction cause of our great motherland. The construction of the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project, highway construction, and the increase in housing construction in Beijing all illustrate the rapid progress of our country's various construction undertakings under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the rapid changes in the people's lives.

    Photos on the theme of the Central Institute for Nationalities, a school for ethnic minorities, and factory directors from worker backgrounds, reflected the People's Government's emphasis on the training of ethnic minorities and worker cadres. Photos showcasing the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou and introducing the silkworm and mulberry, special products of our motherland, truthfully reflected the beauty and loveliness of our motherland. The photos about the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm vividly reflected the beautiful life of the new Chinese peasants steadily moving towards the road of collectivization.

    This issue of the pictorial is more refined than before in terms of layout and content. The increase in color editions has also added a lot of color to the pictorial.

    The new look of "People's Pictorial" not only conforms to the purposes and requirements of international propaganda, but also has a clear division of labor with other pictorials published in China. The implementation of the new editorial policy of "People's Pictorial" will undoubtedly make this pictorial more vividly and accurately reflect the face of our great motherland, making it one of the powerful propaganda tools to encourage the people of the world to oppose aggression and defend peace.

    “人民画报”的新面貌
    阙文
    “人民画报”是全国唯一综合性的大型画报。二年来它的发行数字和国内外读者都不断增加。它在反映我国各种社会改革和经济建设，以及报道各种新鲜事物等方面，是有一定成绩的。
    但是，过去“人民画报”不论在内容、编排、印刷方面都还存在着一些缺点。内容往往不够系统和完整，图片选择得不够精，文字说明不够简炼和概括；编排上显得零碎、拥挤；印刷也不够精致。
    为了更好地反映新中国政治、经济、文化建设的成就，进一步满足国内外日益增多的读者的要求，特别是国外读者的要求，“人民画报”从今年六月号起开始改进自己的内容和形式。在内容方面，减少一般的新闻材料，着重地报道新中国的各项建设，工人和农民的政治、经济、文化生活，科学的成就，壮美的河山和富饶的物产，以及国际保卫和平运动力量的增长等。在编辑方针上，将加强报道的思想性和艺术性，以期广泛适应国内人民、海外侨胞、各兄弟国家的人民以及资本主义国家的各阶层人民的需要。
    “人民画报”六月号以新的面貌跟读者们见面了。这期画报以首要的篇幅刊登了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的照片，生动地反映了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民保卫和平事业的重大事件。
    纪念世界四大文化名人的照片，说明了中国人民对于伟大的文化遗产的重视和对于为人类社会的进步而工作的四大文化名人的敬爱。北京儿童欢庆“六一”国际儿童节的照片，表现了新中国儿童的幸福和愉快，反映了我国共产党和人民政府对儿童的爱护和关怀。
    这期画报还以大量的篇幅刊登了反映我们伟大祖国的建设事业的照片。荆江分洪工程的施工、公路建设和北京房屋的增建等，都说明了在毛主席领导下的我国各项建设事业的突飞猛进和人民生活面貌的迅速变化。
    以少数民族的学府——中央民族学院和工人出身的厂长为题的照片，反映了人民政府对少数民族和工人干部培养的重视。表现我们伟大祖国锦绣河山的杭州风景和介绍祖国特产的蚕桑等照片，真实地反映了我们祖国的美丽和可爱。关于桦川水利农场的照片，极其生动地反映出新中国农民稳步走向集体化道路的美好生活。
    这期画报不论在编排和内容方面都比以前精炼。彩色版的增加，也给画报生色不少。
    “人民画报”的新面貌不仅符合于国际宣传的目的和要求，而且和国内出版的其他画报有了明确的分工。“人民画报”的新编辑方针的贯彻执行，无疑将使这个画报更生动、更正确地反映我们伟大祖国的面貌，使它成为鼓舞全世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的有力宣传工具之一。
