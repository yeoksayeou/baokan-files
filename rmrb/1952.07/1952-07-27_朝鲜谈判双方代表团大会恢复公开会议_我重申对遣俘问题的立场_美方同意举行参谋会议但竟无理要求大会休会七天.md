    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th - The open meeting of the delegations from both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiations resumed on the 26th. At the meeting, General Nam Il, chief representative of our side, pointed out that the crux of the prisoner of war issue lies in the fact that the other side fundamentally violates the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and the principles of Articles 51 and 52 already agreed upon by both sides in the draft armistice agreement, overturning its own promises. General Nam Il pointed out that the other side's plan to detain 20 percent of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 68 percent of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers harbors ulterior motives, which our side absolutely cannot accept. General Nam Il clearly pointed out: "Only Korean prisoners of war whose homes are in the custody of one side can be allowed to return home locally without repatriation, while foreign prisoners of war held by both sides must be fully repatriated. Our side is prepared to fully repatriate the United Nations forces prisoners of war held by our side, and the other side must also fully repatriate the Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war. This is our firm, fair, and reasonable position." On the first day that the other side resumed the open meeting, it felt that continuing to adhere to its unreasonable demands of violating the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, overturning its own promises, and detaining prisoners of war was completely untenable. Therefore, after agreeing to our side's proposal yesterday to hold a meeting of staff officers from both sides to discuss certain textual details of the draft armistice agreement, the other side made a suggestion to adjourn the delegation conference for seven days without any reason. Our side pointed out that the entry of the conference into open meetings does not constitute any reason to interrupt the normal proceedings of the conference. People all over the world are eagerly awaiting the early realization of a Korean armistice. The delegations from both sides should spare no effort to negotiate and resolve the issues. Our side opposed the suggestion of adjournment and advocated that the conference should continue tomorrow. Major General Harrison, the chief representative of the other side, disregarded our side's opposition and withdrew from the meeting hall midway. The first meeting of the staff officers of both sides was held after the adjournment of the conference.

    朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会恢复公开会议
    我重申对遣俘问题的立场
    美方同意举行参谋会议但竟无理要求大会休会七天
    【新华社开城二十六日电】二十六日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会恢复公开会议。在大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：遣俘问题的症结在于对方根本违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约和停战协定草案中双方已同意的第五十一款和第五十二款的原则，推翻对方自己所作的诺言。南日将军指出对方企图扣留朝鲜人民军被俘人员百分之二十，中国人民志愿军被俘人员百分之六十八的方案，包藏不可告人的阴谋，我方绝对不能接受。南日将军明确指出：“朝鲜战俘中只有家在收容一方的可以许其就地回家，不必遣返，而双方收容下的外国战俘则必须全部遣返，我方准备全部遣返我方所收容的联合国军战俘，对方也必须全部遣返中国人民志愿军战俘，这是我方坚定不移、公平合理的立场。”对方在大会恢复公开会议的第一天，即已感觉到继续坚持其违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约、推翻自己的诺言、扣留战俘的无理主张完全陷于理屈词穷的境地，因此，在同意我方昨天所提出的举行双方参谋人员会议商定关于停战协定草案的若干文字细节后，对方即毫无理由地提出代表团大会休会七天的建议。我方指出：大会进入公开会议，并不构成任何中断会议正常进行的理由。全世界人民正切盼朝鲜停战早日实现。双方代表团正应不遗余力地协商解决问题。我方反对休会的建议，主张大会明天继续举行。对方首席代表哈利逊少将不顾我方反对，即中途退出会场。双方参谋会议于大会休会后举行第一次会议。
