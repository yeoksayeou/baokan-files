    Jingxing Mining Bureau Should Pay Attention to Reducing the Ash Content of Raw Coal and Washed Coal

    Editor: The ash content of raw coal and washed coal produced by the Jingxing Mining Bureau, under the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, has been continuously increasing since January of this year. The ash content of raw coal supplied to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has averaged 21.4% (previously around 19%), and is increasing monthly. If the ash content increases to 21%, the recovery rate of washed coal will decrease to 65% (previously 79%), and the loss will be alarming.

    In addition, the ash content of washed coal supplied by the Jingxing Mine to the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant has averaged 13.6% in the past five months (previously below 10% in the first half of last year), with some months as high as 16.2%. As a result, the ash content of coke has also increased to an average of approximately 17.64%. The pig iron production of a certain iron plant using this plant's coke has therefore been greatly reduced.

    Based on repeated reports from the two plants, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau has repeatedly requested the Coal Mine Administration Bureau to reduce the ash content, but to no avail. Later, personnel were sent separately from the two plants and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau to Jingxing to understand the situation on the ground. Everyone believed that this problem could be solved under the current circumstances, and proposed improvement measures, which were approved by the Jingxing Mine, and a draft contract was drawn up. Deputy Director Song of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau personally instructed the Jingxing Mine to take reducing ash content as a future production task.

    After the above consultations, the ash content problem had been initially resolved, but during the negotiation of the contract, the person in charge of the relevant department of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau remained ambiguous about this issue, so that this problem was delayed and unresolved, affecting the production of the two plants. It was not until June 28 that the Coal Mine Administration Bureau raised this issue. They decided that the average ash content of raw coal would be 21% to 22% in the future, and the average ash content of washed coal would be 12.5%. They emphasized the limitations of natural conditions, saying that it would not be possible to reduce the ash content in a short period of time. But they forgot the method of avoiding mixed rocks in coal mining work proposed by Soviet coal washing expert Dubrozin at the coal washing rules research conference. If this problem is delayed and cannot be resolved, the production of the two plants will continue to suffer serious losses. It is hoped that the Jingxing Mining Bureau can solve this problem as soon as possible.

### 井陉矿务局应注意降低原煤和洗煤的灰份

    井陉矿务局应注意降低原煤和洗煤的灰份
    编辑同志：中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局所属井陉矿务局出产的原煤和洗煤，自本年一月份以后，灰份不断增加。供给石景山钢铁厂的原煤，灰份平均已达百分之二十一点四（过去是百分之十九左右），并且逐月上升。灰份如增高至百分之二十一，洗煤的收回率就要降低为百分之六十五（过去是百分之七十九），损失的数字是惊人的。
    此外，井陉矿供应石家庄炼焦厂的洗煤，过去五个月中灰份平均在百分之十三点六（去年上半年平均在百分之十以下），个别月份高达百分之十六点二。焦炭的灰份因而也增加到平均百分之十七点六四左右。采用这个厂的焦炭的某铁厂生铁产量因而大大减少。
    钢铁工业局根据两厂多次报告，曾屡次向煤矿管理总局请求降低灰份，未得结果。以后曾分别和两厂以及煤矿管理总局派人到井陉实地了解情况，大家认为，在目前情况下，这一问题是可以得到解决的，并提出改进办法，征得井陉矿的同意，拟定了合同草案。煤矿管理总局宋副局长又亲自指示井陉矿，将减少灰份作为今后的生产任务。
    经过以上协商，灰份问题本已初步获得解决，但在洽订合同时，煤矿管理总局主管部门负责人对这
    一问题却又始终含糊其词，以致这一问题又拖延不决，影响两厂生产。直到六月二十八日，煤矿管理总局才提出这个问题。他们决定今后原煤灰份平均在百分之二十一至二十二，洗煤灰份平均在百分之十二点五，他们强调自然条件的限制，说短时间内不可能减少灰份。但他们却忘记了苏联选煤专家杜布罗滋在研究选煤规则会议上提出的采煤工作免除混杂岩石的方法。这个问题拖延不能解决，两厂的生产就要继续遭受严重损失，希望井陉矿务局能从速解决这一问题。
