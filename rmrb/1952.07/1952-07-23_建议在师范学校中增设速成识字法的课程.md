    Suggest Adding a Crash Course in Literacy Methods to Normal Schools
    I am a student at Nanchang Normal School. While studying at school, we are also responsible for the task of worker's spare-time education in Nanchang City. Comrade Qi Jianhua’s "Crash Literacy Method" has achieved great success nationwide, but our school has not yet provided us with education about the "Crash Literacy Method." In order to enable us to make greater contributions to the country's cultural construction, I suggest that relevant departments consider adding a "Crash Literacy Method" course to normal schools. Jiang Rensheng
    Editor's Note: Reader Jiang Rensheng's opinion is correct. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has considered adding a "Crash Literacy Method" course to the language teaching method courses in normal schools, and guiding students to conduct teaching practice among workers and peasants.

专栏：来信摘要

    建议在师范学校中增设速成识字法的课程
    我是南昌师范学校的学生。我们一面在学校学习，一面担负着南昌市工人业余教育的任务。祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”已经在全国取得很大成绩，但我们学校里还没有向我们进行有关“速成识字法”的教育。为了使我们能在祖国文化建设工作中有更多的贡献，我建议有关部门考虑在师范学校中增设“速成识字法”的课程。江仁生
    编者按：读者江仁生的意见是正确的。中央人民政府教育部已考虑在师范学校语文教学法课程内，添设“速成识字法”的课程，并指导学生在工农群众中进行教学实习。
