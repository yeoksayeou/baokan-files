Issue 150 of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

To commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of Stalin's brilliant work "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics," this issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Power of Creative Marxism" and includes articles such as "A Precious Ideological Weapon" by Latu, a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "The Influence of Stalin's Work 'Concerning Marxism in Linguistics' on the Development of Hungarian Science" by Fugarasi, an academician of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; and "Comrade Stalin's Work on Linguistics and Problems in Polish Language Research" by Zolkiewski, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, elaborating on the great influence of Stalin's work.

The editorial states: Stalin's work on linguistics, published two years ago, is a model of creative Marxism and a supreme new contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. These works have not only revolutionized the science of linguistics but have also enriched all departments of social science with new theories and new scientific summaries. These works further develop the laws of materialist dialectics, profoundly explain the nature of the base and superstructure, and thoroughly clarify the central issue of our time—an issue of great significance for correctly understanding the laws of social development, namely, the laws concerning the construction of a communist society. The editorial continues: In his work "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics," Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of Marxism, writing: "Marxism is the science of the laws governing the development of nature and society, the revolution of oppressed and exploited masses, the victory of socialism in all countries, and the building of a communist society. This science of Marxism cannot stand still—it is developing and improving." The victory of the Soviet Union, the power of the Soviet state and social system, and the communist construction of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrate the vitality of Marxism-Leninism. The continuous growth of the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries and their increasing influence among the masses demonstrate the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism. The editorial concludes: The great Stalin tirelessly advances and enriches Marxism-Leninism with new brilliant conclusions and new arguments applicable to the new environment of the proletarian struggle. An important task for the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is to constantly ensure that all Communists master the theory of Marxism-Leninism and actively engage in theoretical study. The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, having mastered the theory of Marxism-Leninism, are truly invincible.

Latu writes: In his book "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics," Comrade Stalin smashed Marr's theory and other anti-scientific theories; Comrade Stalin scientifically solved many fundamental questions concerning linguistics. This is also a turning point in the development of Romanian linguistics. Our linguists must follow this doctrine, cooperate with historians, and solemnly deal with issues such as the formation and development of the Romanian language, the roots of its stability and resistance to forced assimilation, and its long-term connection with Slavic languages. Latu continues: In accordance with Comrade Stalin's teachings, a serious scientific elaboration of dialectical materialism, especially historical materialism, based on the specific materials of our country's socialist construction, is a powerful weapon against dogmatism and stereotyped Party writing. In the history of our party, dogmatism and stereotyped Party writing have often led to actions that deviated from the Party's Marxist-Leninist line. Our party has now crushed the right-leaning opportunist tendencies within the party and is engaged in the complete elimination of opportunism and compromise tendencies, therefore, the struggle against dogmatism is of particular significance.

Fugarasi says: Stalin's "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics" has influenced Hungarian science far beyond the field of linguistics, making our entire scientific life vibrant. In the teaching of historical materialism and folk literature, the explanation of the base and superstructure was once full of ambiguity and even confusion, to the point of mechanizing and vulgarizing Marxism. The main task facing Hungarian Marxists is to ensure and correctly interpret and fully understand Stalin's classic analysis of the base and superstructure, as in the Soviet Union. Our next task is to use Stalin's theory to make a serious theoretical explanation of the problems concerning the democratic development of the Hungarian people. Hungarian legal scientists have begun to study the active role of the political and legal superstructure under the conditions of people's democracy.

Zolkiewski writes: The young Polish language research work is still in its initial stage. Stalin's "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics" points out the correct future of artistic development to our literary and art workers, tells us how to discover the immortal factors in artistic works, teaches us to understand the class and national characteristics of art, tells us how to use the national traditions in language and writing, explains the complexity of language and writing problems, and creates a sound and correct methodological foundation for Polish linguistics.

This issue also publishes an article entitled "The Economic Crisis in Yugoslavia" written by Constantininescu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, exposing how the Tito clique's revival of capitalism and allowing American imperialism to plunder Yugoslav resources has caused a sharp decline in Yugoslavia's industrial and agricultural production and unstoppable inflation and the increasing impoverishment of the working people.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五○期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五○期已经出版。
    本期为纪念斯大林的天才著作“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”发表两周年，发表了题为“创造性的马克思主义的伟大力量”的社论，并刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会委员劳图的“宝贵的思想武器”，匈牙利科学院院士浮加拉西的“斯大林的著作‘论马克思主义在语言学中的问题’对匈牙利科学发展的影响”，和波兰统一工人党中央委员会候补委员饶开斯基的“斯大林同志关于语言学的著作与波兰文字研究问题”等文章，阐述斯大林的著作的伟大影响。
    社论写道：斯大林同志在两年前发表的论语言学问题的著作，是创造性的马克思主义的一个典型，是对于马克思—列宁主义宝库的一个无上的新贡献。这些著作不仅使语言学这门科学发生了革命，而且用新的理论、新的科学的总结丰富了社会科学各部门。这些著作进一步发展了唯物辩证法的法则，深刻地说明了基础和上层建筑物的特质，透彻地阐明了我们这个时代的中心问题——对于正确了解社会发展规律有莫大意义的问题，即关于建设共产主义社会的规律的问题。社论接着说：斯大林同志在他的著作“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”中给马克思主义下了一个经典的定义，他写道：“马克思主义是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。马克思主义这一科学是不能停滞不前的，——它是在发展着和改进着。”苏联的胜利、苏维埃国家和社会制度的威力和苏联的共产主义建设，非常突出地表现了马克思—列宁主义理论的生命力。各国共产党和工人党的队伍的不断壮大，以及它们在群众中的影响的不断增强，表现了马克思—列宁主义的所向无敌的力量。社论最后说：伟大的斯大林不倦地用新的辉煌的结论、用新的适用于无产阶级斗争的新环境的论点，推进并丰富了马克思—列宁主义。各国共产党和工人党的重要任务就是要经常注意使所有的共产党员都能掌握马克思—列宁主义理论，并积极从事理论学习工作。掌握了马克思—列宁主义理论的各国共产党和工人党是真正所向无敌的。
    劳图写道：斯大林同志在他的“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”一书中粉碎了马尔的理论和其他反科学的理论；斯大林同志对于许多有关语言学的基本问题作了科学的解决。这在罗马尼亚语言学的发展上也是一个转折点。我们的语言学家必须遵照这个学说，与历史家合作，郑重地来处理罗马尼亚语言的形成与发展、它的稳固性和抗拒强迫同化的抵抗力的根源以及它和斯拉夫语言的长时间的联系等问题。劳图接着说：依照斯大林同志的学说，根据我国社会主义建设的具体材料对辩证唯物主义、特别是对历史唯物主义作认真的科学阐发，对于反对教条主义和党八股的斗争是一个有力的武器。在我们党的历史中，教条主义和党八股常常引起脱离党的马克思—列宁主义的路线的行为。我们党现在已粉碎了党内的右倾机会主义的偏向，并从事于完全肃清机会主义和妥协倾向的工作，因此，反对教条主义的斗争有着特别的意义。
    浮加拉西说：斯大林的“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”对于匈牙利科学的影响远远超出了语言学的领域，使我们整个的科学生活变得生气勃勃起来了。在讲授历史唯物主义和民间文学方面，对于基础和上层建筑的解释曾经充满了含糊不清甚至混乱的现象，以至使马克思主义机械化和庸俗化了。匈牙利马克思主义者所面临的主要任务便是保证和苏联一样正确地解释和全面地了解斯大林对于基础及上层建筑的经典的分析。我们的次一项任务便是运用斯大林的这一理论对关于匈牙利人民民主发展的问题作一严肃的理论解释。匈牙利法律科学工作者已开始研究在人民民主条件下政治与法律上层建筑的积极作用。
    饶开斯基写道：年青的波兰语文研究工作还在初步阶段。斯大林的“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”向我们的文艺工作者指出了艺术发展的正确的前途，告诉我们如何发现艺术作品中不朽的因素，教我们了解艺术的阶级性与民族特点，告诉我们如何使用语文中的民族传统观念，说明了语言—文字问题的复杂性，为波兰的语言学创造了健全而正确的方法论的基础。
    本期还刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记康斯坦丁尼斯库所写的“南斯拉夫的经济危机”一文，揭露由于铁托集团使资本主义复活并听任美帝国主义掠夺南斯拉夫资源，造成南斯拉夫工农业生产剧减和不可遏止的通货膨胀及劳动人民日益贫困化的情况。    （新华社）
