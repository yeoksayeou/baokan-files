Editor's note: This article was written by the Cultural and Educational Office of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, based on the teaching experience of the troops. It tells us how to further develop reading and writing teaching activities on the basis of accelerated literacy, in order to improve students' reading and writing levels. This is a problem that urgently needs to be paid widespread attention.

What should be paid attention to when transitioning from accelerated literacy teaching to text teaching

After accelerated literacy teaching, a common situation has arisen in the study units of the troops, that is, the gap between reading ability and writing ability is very large. For example, among 134 students in the third teaching class of a certain unit, 54 people can write "sentences" of 50 to 100 characters, 51 people can write "sentences" of 100 to 200 characters, and 24 people can write "sentences" of more than 200 characters; but they can all read Volume 4 of the Chinese textbook. This shows that the development of reading ability and writing ability is very unbalanced. Therefore, most students currently have the following problems: 1. Although they can generally read, they are still not proficient in applying familiar characters in new contexts, and sometimes they cannot read sentences when reading texts, and cannot fully understand the central idea of the text; 2. They can recognize and explain the main meaning of single characters, but they cannot write or use them; 3. They use characters and words improperly, and cannot connect characters into sentences, or connect them incompletely. According to the statistics of seven assignments, 28 percent of the sentences were ungrammatical, such as "The whole world has obtained the red flag fluttering," and "We are fighting heroes in Korea"; 4. Accumulation of words and sentences, empty content, lack of focus, and unclear paragraphs.

The root causes of the above phenomena are, first of all, that students have not mastered the form and meaning of the characters; secondly, they do not have enough understanding of the spirit of "writing sentences". Many students believe that writing articles is a matter for intellectuals, not the same as speaking, and they have great concerns; some students, when writing, rigidly use classical Chinese, replacing the word "I" with the word "吾", and the word "see" with the word "观", and some misuse some words and sentences; another reason is that students lack general writing knowledge (such as article structure, wording, subject matter, etc.).

Based on the above situation, the focus of future Chinese teaching should be on improving reading and writing levels on the basis of accelerated literacy education. Accelerated literacy education has laid the foundation for reading and writing. The purpose of Chinese teaching is not only to consolidate the original single characters, but also to improve from consolidation and further consolidate from improvement. To this end, the following points must be noted in the text teaching: 1. Students should be required to recognize and explain more than 1,600 single characters before carrying out text teaching, and be able to apply the familiar characters in new contexts. Only with this condition can students have the ability to learn independently, and achieve the purpose of consolidation and improvement through frequent reading and writing; 2. They must be able to read sentences when reading articles. If they cannot read sentences, it means that they have not yet initially mastered the form of the characters, and it is difficult to understand the meaning of the characters, and the single characters cannot be consolidated; 3. When carrying out text teaching, attention should be paid to not losing the learned single characters, because if the learned single characters are gradually lost or reduced, it will eventually be impossible to meet the requirements before the text teaching, and the consolidation and improvement will lose their basis; 4. Among the 2,000 characters that have been learned, at least 60% to 70% of the character forms must be mastered, that is to say, not only can they be read, explained, and applied in new contexts, but also they must be able to write. Because if they are completely unfamiliar with writing characters and sentences, and do not have the basis for independent learning, relying entirely on the teacher to teach a little and learn a little, it is actually equivalent to not having carried out accelerated literacy teaching, and still using the old method to teach texts.

If the students' current level is still far from the above conditions, they can strike while the iron is hot and make a focused effort. In the effort, classroom teaching and after-school review must be implemented with an emphasis on improving writing, so as to transition to text teaching in a planned and step-by-step manner. The specific method is to pay attention to mastering the principle of "more reading, more writing, and more practice" to help students solve the problem of mastering the form of the characters. In addition, the steps must be interspersed with each other and closely combined, and no one should be engaged in isolation. Lower classes can focus on reading and writing characters; higher classes can focus on practicing "writing sentences."

The purpose of text teaching is to solve the "four skills" problem of each character, and then improve writing ability on the basis of the "four skills." At present, some teachers believe that accelerated literacy teaching and text teaching are separate, so they do another set of things when carrying out text teaching, not according to the students' level, and talk about everything like a political class. For example, when some teachers talk about the lesson "American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people," they copy a lot of historical materials, and the prepared lesson plan will take three days to teach. This teaching method is not in line with the purpose of improving students' reading and writing. On the other hand, attention should be paid to overcoming the blindly optimistic mood of some students, for example, some think that "Volume 5 of the Chinese textbook will be read at once" "There is nothing to talk about" (some teachers also think that there are no new characters or new words to talk about, so the class has formed "reading the newspaper", which affects the learning effect). The main reason for these phenomena is that students think that "learning culture is literacy," and that learning two thousand characters is the completion of the learning task, and they do not understand that the purpose of accelerated literacy is to lay the foundation for improving reading and writing. Therefore, in the transition stage from accelerated literacy to text teaching, attention must be paid to overcoming this deviation.

How to Guide Reading

The main purpose of carrying out reading activities is to repeatedly meet the new characters learned in the intensive literacy stage in the reading process, so as to achieve familiarity and consolidation, and gradually develop from occupying one meaning of the character to occupying several meanings of the character. After the students can recognize more than 2,000 characters, they are particularly happy when they pick up the textbook and find that they can read it, and their enthusiasm for reading is also very high. Therefore, as long as the cultural teacher can grasp this point and organize and guide it well, the students will make rapid progress. According to the experience of some troops, in addition to doing a good job in the general preparation for reading teaching, the following issues must be noted in guiding reading:

First, check the reading "capital" and prepare for reading. When transitioning from the intensive literacy stage to the reading stage, it is necessary to check how many new characters the students have recognized, and whether they have the "capital" for reading; or conduct a single-character review before starting reading. If it is found in the inspection that some comrades recognize very few new characters and are far "behind," they should try to make up for it, and avoid mechanically transitioning to reading according to the progress, otherwise the students will not be able to read sentences when they pick up the book, and they will lose confidence.

Before reading, it is also necessary to prepare reading materials. The experience of many units is that in addition to the prescribed Chinese textbooks, more popular books and newspapers should be selected as reading materials, and it is best to have one copy for each person. Choose some "short, simple, and clear" articles for everyone to read. Some experimental units that carry out accelerated literacy teaching also selected a lot of poems, clappers, and rhymes when reading, which are rhyming and easy to read, and the content is simple, and the students feel very interesting. But it should not be too much, otherwise, in learning to write sentences, students will only be accustomed to writing clappers and rhymes, which will affect the overall development of writing ability.

Second, clarify the essentials of reading and correct shortcomings at any time. Because reading books and newspapers is very difficult for students, from large characters to small characters, from regular script to Song typeface, from reading single characters to reading sentences. Many units told the students the essentials of reading at the beginning: "Fingers pointing at the characters, eyes looking at the characters, brains thinking about the characters, mouths reading the characters, single characters connected into sentences." After the reading starts, it is also necessary to pay attention to discovering problems at any time and solving them in time. In the activity of reading popular reading materials, there are the following four points that teachers need to grasp well in teaching: 1. In the process of reading, students often have phenomena such as tongue twisters, adding words, dropping words, and misreading words due to insufficient consolidation of single characters. If the teacher does not pay attention to correcting them at any time, it will affect the role of consolidating new characters in the reading stage. 2. Some students drop the words they do not know when reading, so they do not read completely, which also affects the consolidation of new characters. The solution, in addition to the single-character review and make-up mentioned earlier, is that the teacher can write the unrecognized characters on the blackboard before class, attach phonetic symbols and teach them to the students, and make temporary breakthroughs. 3. Pay attention to cutting off the "trailing sounds" in the students' reading. Some students often have a "ya" sound at the end of the sentence when reading, for example, "Everyone learns culture" is read as "Everyone ya - people ya - learn ya - culture ya." This confuses a complete sentence. Therefore, teachers must strictly require students to read "one character one sound." 4. Avoid the phenomenon of confusing homographs. The students have just made a breakthrough in new characters, and they often confuse some homographs (such as the characters 辨 and 办, 找 and 我). The teacher should also collect these characters on the blackboard before class and let everyone practice them to avoid the phenomenon of "misattributing the hat" in reading.

Third, flexibly use various reading methods. Reading methods can generally be combined with free reading and collective reading, and model reading. The order should be: 1. The teacher reads and explains the model. The model reading focuses on long sentences, and the model explanation focuses on difficult characters and difficult words. Except for texts with relatively deep meanings, it is generally not necessary to explain them word by word and sentence by sentence; 2. The teacher leads the reading; 3. The students try to read and try to explain, everyone corrects, and the teacher finally affirms; 4. Mutual aid group reviews, everyone takes turns reading and explaining, or one person leads the reading, and everyone follows the reading. Free reading should emphasize the mutual aid group as a unit, so as to solve various problems that occur in reading, and teachers should also go deep into each mutual aid group to guide reading. When carrying out reading activities, it is also necessary to pay attention to mastering the principle of gradual improvement from slow to fast, and from easy to difficult. Textbooks generally have fewer new characters and easier sentences to explain in the front; more new characters and more difficult sentences to explain in the back. Therefore, it is very important to adopt various methods according to the students' ability to accept and progress, so that reading can be deepened step by step. In reading activities, we should also pay attention to carrying out the learning competition movement of mutual aid groups, and eliminate the "lagging behind" phenomenon in a mutually encouraging way. Assign someone to "teach" the individual students who are far "behind" to catch up with the team in time, so as not to make the "behind" students feel depressed because they cannot keep up with the learning progress.

Guiding students to carry out a lot of reading is an important key to consolidating the achievements of accelerated literacy teaching, and it is also a good method to further improve students' reading and writing abilities. Therefore, not only should students be organized to read after breaking through new characters, but also more time should be set aside to guide students to carry out a lot of reading after transitioning to text teaching.

How to break through the difficulty of writing sentences

After the third teaching class of the third company of the guard of a certain unit of the Central South Military Region carried out intensive literacy, on the basis of the original literacy, most of the students in the class recognized another 1,400 to 1,700 new characters. They can not only read the fourth volume of the Chinese textbook compiled and printed by the General Political Department, but also read general reading materials. Student Tao Yuxi, in this study, he recognized another 1,658 characters on the basis of his original literacy. He read a long poem "Guarding the National Defense of the Motherland" in the 61st issue of "Soldier's Life," with few new characters, and could explain the general meaning of the poem. However, the writing ability of these students is quite low. After review, consolidation, and reading, they were asked to dictate seven sentences (103 characters). Among the 18 people, one person had 80% wrong, misspelled, and omitted characters; three people had 40% to 50%; and eight people had 20% to 30%.

This phenomenon is completely imaginable. In more than a month, they suddenly recognized another 1,400 or 500 characters on the basis of the original, and these characters have never been written, coupled with the fact that some of the original characters they knew could not be written, so it naturally caused a disparity between reading ability and writing ability. This phenomenon clearly tells us that in textbook teaching, the texts of each volume need to be carried out in conjunction with reading and writing. Only in this way can we rapidly improve the Chinese level of students. If you read the fourth volume of Chinese language, and do the homework of the second and third volumes, it will definitely affect the learning effect.

In order to solve the above problem, the company used 52 hours to carry out a series of activities such as copying, dictating, free writing, and writing feelings before entering textbook teaching, so that the students' writing ability was greatly improved. In the final day of free dictation, Huang Fuchang dictated 681 characters, with only 31 wrong, misspelled, and omitted characters (the number of wrong characters of all the comrades in the class did not exceed 10%).

The students' ability to write characters and sentences has been improved, and they are basically able to do the homework of the fourth volume of Chinese language (the homework of the fourth volume of Chinese language requires the ability to write short articles of feeling). In this case, the third teaching class switched to the fourth volume of Chinese textbook teaching.

According to the experience of the guard third company in writing characters and sentences, 52 hours is enough for the third teaching class. The time allocation is as follows: copying (focusing on single characters in the second, third, and fourth volumes of Chinese language) 20 hours; dictation 20 hours; free writing and writing short articles of feeling 12 hours.

The above time is proposed according to the students' level and needs. After reading, most of the students in the third class have recognized another 1,400 or 500 characters on the basis of the original, but most of them cannot write. After 20 hours of copying, they generally copied the characters they knew once or twice. When dictating, it is necessary to give students the opportunity to review, and the ratio of review time to dictation time is one to two. In this way, after a review, they have copied again, and the average students can basically write down the characters they recognize. On this basis, plus 12 hours of free writing, students' ability to write characters and sentences can be greatly improved.

In writing characters and sentences, according to the experience of the third teaching class, the following points should also be noted:

(1) It is necessary to focus on solving the students' ideological concerns. At the beginning of copying, students saw difficult characters (such as 吁, 馋), and did not know where to start, and had no confidence. Therefore, it is necessary to first break their concerns and encourage their courage. When switching from dictation to free writing, students generally reflect that there is nothing to write about. They think that writing sentences must be another kind of sentence, which is somewhat different from what they say. This requires telling them how to say it and how to write it, and to write what they think of and what they see.

(2) Explain to the students that they should be careful when writing characters and master the characteristics of Chinese characters. When students start writing characters, it is easy to add or omit a stroke. This is partly because they are not proficient in writing characters, and partly because they are careless. Therefore, it is necessary to tell them that carelessness is not allowed. A Chinese character with one more stroke or one less stroke has a big difference (such as 乌 and 鸟), and the length of the strokes also has a great relationship (such as 土 and 士). At the same time, it is necessary to tell them the characteristics of Chinese characters, for example, a difficult character is often composed of several easy characters, and some characters have a phonetic component, and some characters have a semantic component, etc. In this way, it can greatly help them remember how to write characters.

(3) Give students time to review before dictation, and specify the scope of review for them. Because the students initially master the writing of characters, they are not very reliable. First, delineate a scope and ask them to review, on the one hand, it can make their impression of these characters more profound, and on the other hand, it can make them feel confident, so they will not be flustered when writing.

(4) Review and write in sections. Whether it is copying, reviewing, or dictating, it is necessary to divide it into paragraphs. In this way, students will have a focus when reviewing and writing. Otherwise, a textbook with more than 2,000 characters, taking care of this and not taking care of that, the energy is not concentrated, and the effect will not be great.

(5) Dictate in groups. When dictating with a teaching class as a unit, students often cannot hear clearly what the teacher is saying, and sometimes students cannot be sure how to use certain characters. If they ask the teacher at that time, it will disrupt the classroom order, and if they do not ask, they will not write well. Taking the group as a unit, they can ask the small teacher if they cannot hear clearly or do not understand. At the same time, the small teacher can also grasp the progress of the group and launch a competition. The small teacher can help the individual poor comrades more so that they can quickly keep up with the progress.

In addition, according to the experience of promoting accelerated literacy method in the East China Military Region, in the process of writing teaching, in addition to writing single characters, you can also use 15 hours to let students copy the more than 700 main words in the first and second volumes of Chinese language. In this way, not only is the memory of the form of single characters consolidated, but also the scope of the meaning of the characters is expanded.

Finally, in the process of writing characters and sentences, we should also mobilize students to write a lot and read a lot. Every student should have a small notebook with them, write what they hear, write what they see, write what they think of, and then ask the small teacher to correct it, and the teacher to review it. While reading a lot, we should plan, organize, and purposefully learn the usage of characters through reading. Every time you finish reading an article, think about what you have gained, and then write it down and correct each other. Only by closely combining reading and writing can the students' writing ability be quickly improved.

    怎样在速成识字的基础上提高学员的阅读和写作能力
    编者按：本文是由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部宣传部文教办公室根据部队的教学经验写成的。它告诉我们怎样在速成识字的基础上，进一步开展阅读和写话的教学活动，以提高学员的阅读和写作水平。这是目前亟应引起普遍注意的问题。
    从速成识字教学转入课文教学应注意些什么
    经过速成识字教学以后，在部队的学习单位中普遍产生了一种情况，就是阅读能力和写作能力的距离很大。例如某部第三教学班一百三十四名学员当中，有五十四个人能写五十字到一百字的“话”，五十一个人能写一百字至二百字的“话”，二十四个人能写二百多字的“话”；而他们却都能阅读四册语文。这说明阅读能力和写作能力的发展是很不平衡的。因此，目前学员大部分都存在下面几个问题：一、虽然一般都能够阅读，但对生字“搬家”仍然不够熟练，有时在阅读课文的时候也念不成句子，不能完全领会课文的中心大意；二、能认识能讲解单字的主要大意，但不会写和用；三、用字用词不当，不能把字联成句子，或联得不完整。根据七篇作业的统计，其中有百分之二十八的句子不通，例如“全世界得到红旗飘飘”、“我们在朝鲜打仗英雄”等；四、词句堆砌，内容空洞，缺乏中心，段落不明。
    产生上面现象的根源，首先是因为学员没有掌握住字形、字义；其次是对“写话”的精神体会不够。不少学员认为写文章是知识分子的事，不是和说话一样，顾虑很大；有的学员写作的时候，硬搬古文，以“吾”字代替“我”字，以“观”字代替“看”字，有的乱用一些词句；另一个原因，就是学员缺乏一般的写作常识（如文章结构、措词、题材等）。
    根据上述的情况，今后语文教学的重点，应当是在速成识字教育的基础上，提高阅读水平和写作水平。速成识字教育已经给阅读和写作打下了基础，语文教学的目的，不仅是巩固原来识的单字，而且要从巩固中提高，从提高中进一步巩固。为此，在课文教学中间必须注意下列几点：一、要求学员在进行课文教学以前，单字会认会讲一千六百个以上，并能作到“搬家”。只有有了这个条件，学员才能有自学的能力，并通过经常的阅读和写话，达到巩固和提高的目的；二、要能在阅读文章的时候念成句子，如果念不成句子，就说明还不会初步掌握字形，也就难于领会字义，单字得不到巩固；三、在进行课文教学的时候，要注意不能使学会的单字丢掉，因为如果学会的单字逐渐丢掉或减少，最后就不可能达到课文教学以前的要求，而使巩固和提高失去了依据；四、在已经学过的两千字当中，至少要掌握百分之六十至七十的字形，就是说不仅会念、会讲、能“搬家”，而且要会写，因为如果对写字、写话完全生疏，没有具备自学能力的基础，完全靠教员教一点学一点，就实际上等于没有进行过速成识字教学，仍用旧的方法教课文。
    如果学员现有水平，和上述条件还有距离的话，就可“趁热打铁”，有重点地突击。在突击当中课堂教学及课后复习的时候必须贯彻以提高写作为主，以便有计划、有步骤地转入课文教学。具体的作法，要注意掌握“多读、多写、多练”这一原则，帮助学员解决掌握字形问题。另外，步骤之间必须互相穿插，紧密结合，不可孤立地单搞某一种。较低班次可以以阅读、写字为重点；较高班次可以以练习“写话”为重点。
    课文教学的目的，是要解决每个字的“四会”问题，然后在“四会”的基础上再提高写作能力。目前有一部分教员认为速成识字教学和课文教学是分开的，因此在进行课文教学的时候就另搞一套，不根据学员水平，像上政治课一样什么都讲，例如有的教员讲“美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌”一课的时候，抄了很多历史材料，准备的教案要讲三天。这种教学方法是和提高学员的阅读、写作的目的不相符合的。另一方面，要注意克服一部分学员中的盲目乐观情绪，例如有的认为“五册语文一下就看完了”“没有什么可讲的了”（某些教员也认为没有什么生字、生词可讲，因此上课便形成了“读报”，影响了学习收效）。产生这些现象的主要原因，是由于学员认为“学文化就是识字”，以为会了两千字就是完成了学习任务，而不明白速成识字的目的，是为了给提高阅读和写作打下基础。因此，在由速成识字转入课文教学的过渡阶段，必须注意克服这种偏差。
     怎样指导阅读
    开展阅读活动的主要目的，是为了把突击识字阶段所学得的生字，在阅读过程中反复地见面，以达到熟悉和巩固，并且逐渐由原来占有的一种字义，发展成为占有数种字义。学员们在能认识两千多字以后，一旦拿起课本发现自己可以念下去的时候，心情是特别愉快的，阅读的积极性也是很高的。因此，只要文化教员能掌握这一点，很好地加以组织和辅导，学员们就会很快地进步。根据有些部队的经验，除了做好阅读教学的一般准备工作以外，在指导阅读上，必须注意下面几个问题：
    第一，检查阅读“本钱”，做好阅读准备。从突击识字阶段转入阅读阶段的时候，必须检查以下学员认识了多少生字，是否有阅读的“本钱”；或者再进行一次单字复习，然后开始阅读。在检查当中如发现有的同志生字认得还很少，“掉队”很远，应当设法补习，要避免机械地按进度转入阅读，不然会使学员拿起书念不成句，而丧失信心。
    在阅读以前还要准备好阅读的材料。许多单位的经验是：阅读的材料除了规定的国语课本以外，多选一些通俗的书报刊物，最好能做到每人一本。选择一些“简短、浅显、中心明确”的文章让大家阅读。有些进行速成识字教学的试验单位，在阅读的时候还选了不少诗歌、快板和顺口溜等，读起来有韵顺口，内容浅显，学员们感到很有味道。但不宜太多，否则，学员在学习写话中，就只习惯于写快板和韵文，影响写作能力的全面发展。
    第二，弄清阅读要领，随时纠正缺点。因为阅读书报，对学员来说，从大字到小字，从楷体到宋体，从念单字到念成句子，是有很多困难的。很多单位在开始时，就向学员们讲阅读要领：“手指着字、眼看着字、脑子想着字、嘴巴念着字、单字连成句。”阅读开始以后，也还要随时注意发现问题，及时解决。在阅读通俗读物活动当中，有以下四点需要教员在教学中好好掌握：一、学员在阅读当中，由于单字不够巩固，因此常常发生顺口溜、添字、掉字、念错字等现象，教员如果不注意随时纠正，会影响阅读阶段巩固生字的作用。二、有的学员在阅读当中，遇到不识的字就丢下不念，所以就念的不完整，也影响了生字的巩固。解决的办法除了前面所提到的用检查阅读“本钱”，进行单字复习、补习之外，教员还可以在课前将不认识的字写在黑板上，附上注音符号教给学员，临时突击。三、注意割掉学员阅读当中的“尾巴音”。有的学员在阅读当中常常后面带一个“呀”音，例如“人人学文化”就读成“人呀——人呀——学呀——文呀——化呀。”这样就把一个完整的句子弄糊涂了。因此，教员必须严格要求学员“一字一音”地读。四、避免把同形字混淆起来的现象。学员刚刚突击完生字，对一些同形字（例如辨与办、找与我等字）往往会混淆不清，教员也应当在课前将这类字汇集写在黑板上，让大家练习一下，避免阅读当中的“张冠李戴”现象。
    第三，灵活地运用各种阅读方法。阅读的方法，一般可以采用自由阅读和集体阅读、范读相结合。在顺序上应该是：一、教员范读范讲。范读以长句为重点，范讲以难字难词为重点，除了含意比较深的课文以外，一般不必逐字逐句地讲解；二、教员领读；三、学员试读、试讲，大家纠正，教员最后肯定；四、互助组复习，大家轮流读讲，或者一人领读，大家跟读。自由阅读要强调以互助组为单位，以便解决阅读当中发生的各种问题，教员也应当深入各个互助组去指导阅读。在开展阅读活动的时候，还必须注意掌握由慢到快，由易到难，逐步提高的原则。课本一般都是前面的生字少，语句好讲；后面的生字多，语句难讲，因此，根据学员的接受能力和进步的情形，采取各种方式，使阅读步步深入，这是非常重要的。在阅读活动当中，也应该注意开展互助组的学习竞赛运动，以互相鼓励的方式消除“掉队”现象。对个别“掉队”很远的学员，指定专人“包教”，及时赶上队去，不致使“掉队”学员因为赶不上学习进度，而情绪低落。
    指导学员进行大量的阅读是巩固速成识字教学成绩的重要关键，也是进一步提高学员阅读与写作能力的好方法，因之，不但在突击生字以后要组织学员阅读，就是转入课文教学以后，也还需要划出较多的时间指导学员进行大量阅读。
     怎样突破写话的困难
    中南军区某部警卫三连第三教学班经过突击识字以后，在原有的识字基础上，全班大部分人又认识了一千四百到一千七百个生字。他们不但能阅读总政治部编印的第四册国语课本，并且能阅读一般的读物。学员陶玉喜，在这次学习当中，他在原来的识字基础上又认识了一千六百五十八个字。他读了“战士生活”第六十一期一首长诗“守卫着祖国的国防”，没有几个生字，并且能讲出诗的大意。然而，这些学员的写作能力却相当低，在复习、巩固和阅读以后，曾经叫他们听写了七句话（一百零三个字），十八个人当中，有一个人错、别、漏字达百分之八十；有三个人达百分之四十到百分之五十；有八个人达百分之二十到百分之三十。
    这个现象是完全可以想到的。在一个多月的时间内，他们一下子在原来的基础上，又认识了一千四五百字，这些字从来没有写过，再加上原来识的字中间，有一些也不会写，因此，很自然地造成了阅读能力和写字写话能力的悬殊。这一现象很明显地告诉了我们，在课本教学当中，每一册的课文是需要阅读和写作相辅进行的，只有这样，我们才能使学员的语文程度迅速地提高。如果念的是四册国语，做的是二、三册的作业，那一定会影响学习效果的。
    为了解决上面这一个问题，该连在没有进入课本教学以前，用了五十二个小时进行了抄写、听写、自由写、写感想等一系列的活动，使学员的写作能力大大地提高了。在最后一天自由听写当中，黄福昌听写了六百八十一个字，错、别、漏字只有三十一个（全班同志的错别字也没有超过百分之十）。
    学员写字写话能力得到了提高，基本上已经能够做第四册国语的作业了（第四册国语作业要求能写短小的感想文章）。在这种情况下，第三教学班才转入了第四册国语课本教学。
    根据警卫三连写字、写话中间的经验，第三教学班用五十二个小时就够用了。时间的分配是这样的：抄写（以二、三、四册国语单字为重点）二十个小时；听写二十个小时；自由写和写短小的感想文十二个小时。
    以上的时间是根据学员的水平和需要提出来的。阅读之后三班的学员大多数已经在原有的基础上，又认识了一千四五百个字，但绝大部分不会写，经过二十小时的抄写，一般都把自己识的字抄写了一两遍。听写的时候必须给学员复习的机会，复习和听写时间的比重为一比二。这样，在复习的时候，又经过了一遍抄写，一般的学员就可以基本上把自己认识的字写下来了。在这个基础上，再加上十二个小时的自由写，学员的写字、写话能力就可以大大提高一步。
    在写字、写话当中，根据第三教学班的经验，还应该注意到下面几点：
    （一）要有重点地解决学员思想上的顾虑。一开始抄写，学员看到难写的字（如吁、馋），都不知道从什么地方插手，没有信心。因而要首先打破他们的顾虑，鼓起他们的勇气来。由听写转到自由写的时候，学员都普遍反映没有什么话好写，他们认为写话一定是另一种话，和自己所讲的有些不同。这就需要告诉他们怎么说就怎么写，想到什么、看到什么就写什么。
    （二）向学员说明写字要细心，要掌握中国字的特点。学员们开始写字的时候，很容易多一笔少一笔，这一方面由于他们写字不熟练，另一方面是由于他们粗心。因此，须要告诉他们粗心是不行的。中国字多一笔少一笔有很大差别（如乌和鸟），笔划长短也有很大关系（如土和士）。同时，要告诉他们中国字的特点，例如一个难写的字往往是几个容易的字凑的，又有的字傍音，有的字傍义等等。这样，就可以大大地帮助他们记忆字的写法。
    （三）在听写以前要给学员复习时间，并给他们指定复习范围。因为学员初步掌握字的写法，不十分牢靠，先划定一个范围，叫他们复习，一方面可以使他们对这些字的印象更深刻，另一方面可以使他们心中有底，写的时候不致心慌意乱。
    （四）要分段复习分段写。抄写也好，复习也好，听写也好，要分出段落来。这样，学员在复习和写的时候就有了重点。不然，一本课本两千多字，顾了这里顾不了那里，精力不集中，效果就不会大。
    （五）要分小组来听写。以一个教学班为单位来听写，学员往往听不清楚教员说的是什么话，有时候学员对某些字也不能肯定怎么用，如果当时问教员就会使课堂秩序紊乱，不问就写不好。以小组为单位，听不清或不懂的可以问小教员。同时，小教员还可以掌握本小组的进度，发起竞赛。个别差的同志，小教员可以多帮助他，使他很快地跟上进度。
    此外，根据华东军区推行速成识字法的经验，在写字教学过程中，除了书写单字以外，还可以用十五小时的时间，将一、二册国语课本当中七百多个主要的词让学员作抄写练习。这样，不但巩固了单字的字形的记忆，同时也扩大了字义的范围。
    最后，在写字、写话过程中，还应该发动学员大量写，大量阅读。每一个学员都应该有一个小本子随身带着，听到什么写什么，看见什么写什么，想起什么写什么，然后叫小教员改，教员审查。在大量阅读的同时，应有计划、有组织、有目的地通过阅读来学习字的使用法。每逢看完一篇，要想一想有什么收获，然后把它写出来，大家互相改正。只有把阅读和写话紧密结合起来，学员们的写作能力才能很快地提高。
