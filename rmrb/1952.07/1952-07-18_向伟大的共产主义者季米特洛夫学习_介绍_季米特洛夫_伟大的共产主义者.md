    Learn from the Great Communist Dimitrov
    ——Introducing "Dimitrov – The Great Communist"
    Zhang Zifan
    Translated by Jiang Qisheng, Published by Sanlian Bookstore

    "Dimitrov – The Great Communist" was originally a "Biography of Dimitrov" published in 1948 by the Sofia Newspaper Management Department, without an author's signature. Jiang Qisheng translated it into Chinese based on the Russian text. The translator also compiled the July 15, 1949 editorial from the newspaper "For a Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" titled "Outstanding Activist of the International Workers' Movement" and the obituary issued by Stalin, the CPSU (B), and the Soviet government leaders for Dimitrov's death at the beginning of the book. In addition, the appendix also includes "Sofia Mourns Dimitrov," "Resolution of the Bulgarian Government on Commemorating Dimitrov," and Comrade Liu Ningyi's article written in 1947, "I Met Dimitrov." The entire book has 155 pages.

    The "Biography of Dimitrov" is divided into fourteen sections (the original book had eleven sections, only written up to the summer of 1948; the Chinese translator added the last three sections), starting from Dimitrov's childhood and ending with his death. In this booklet, the author vividly portrays the glorious history of struggle and the heroic and noble character of this generation's giant with passionate and lively writing. As the original author said: "He (referring to Dimitrov) is always the same, his life and all his activities – are a passionate book of struggle and longing for a bright future." (Page 17 of this book) Indeed, his life is an epic of heroic struggle for the cause of communism, which has profound educational significance and great appeal for us.

    Dimitrov was born on June 18, 1882, in a proletarian revolutionary family in Kovachevtsi village, Radomir district, southwest of Sofia. At the age of twelve, he had to leave school and become a printing worker due to the pressure of life. The profession of typesetting and the desire for knowledge aroused a fervent love of books in this young worker. At the age of fifteen, he became an activist in the Sofia Printing Workers' Union. His first article published in the "Printing Workers' Newspaper" was to fight for hygienic conditions for printing workers at work. On one occasion, he firmly refused to typeset a few lines in an article by the well-known reactionary Minister Radoslavov attacking the workers' organizations for celebrating the May Day rally. Later, when Dimitrov was elected as a member of parliament and met Radoslavov in the National Assembly, Radoslavov shouted angrily at him: "I knew you a long time ago. You are that unruly brat who dared to tamper with my article when you were only fifteen years old." At the age of eighteen, Dimitrov was elected as the secretary of the Printing Workers' Union. In 1902, he joined the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party. He stood on the side of the revolutionary Marxist "Tesnyaks" (predecessor of the Bulgarian Communist Party), led by Dimitar Blagoev, and actively fought against revisionism. After the party split, he became the secretary of the Sofia organization of the "Tesnyaks." In 1905, at the age of twenty-three, Dimitrov was elected as the secretary of the Bulgarian Revolutionary General Trade Union and led the Bulgarian workers in their struggle. From 1909 until his death, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Party.

    Dimitrov was loved by the Bulgarian workers. On one occasion, when he had just been released from prison, the police arrested him again for speaking at a miners' rally. But when he was escorted to Sofia and stepped out of the train, demonstrating workers snatched him from the hands of the police.

    At the end of 1920, Dimitrov went to Russia to attend the Third Congress of the Communist International. The day after he arrived, he met with Lenin. At the All-Soviet Trade Union Congress held at the same time, Lenin introduced Dimitrov to Stalin. Dimitrov became one of the most loyal students of Lenin and Stalin.

    Because he led the Bulgarian September Uprising of 1923, the reactionary government sentenced him to death in absentia. At the trial organized by the Bulgarian fascists against the leading organs of the Communist Party in 1926, he was once again sentenced to death in absentia. In 1923, he was forced into exile and lived the life of a professional revolutionary, and from then on, he became an internationally renowned activist. He worked actively in the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

    Every part of this booklet is inspiring, especially the "Leipzig" section. Less than a month after the Hitler bandits came to power, they concocted the "Reichstag Fire" conspiracy, attempting to attack and eliminate the Communist Party, arresting and interrogating Dimitrov. Dimitrov denounced and exposed this shameless conspiracy of framing, and his speeches exposed the true arsonists of the Reichstag, Hitler and Goering. Although the presiding judge interrupted his speech thirty times, his voice of truth turned himself from a defendant into a judge, exposing the true face of the Hitler bandits to the people of the world. Reading this section, and thinking about the ongoing persecution of the French Communist Party and its leader Duclos in France, it really feels like history is "repeating itself." Isn't the Binet government of France carrying out the same tricks directed by the American imperialists, the successors of today's fascism? But history will ultimately judge that it will not be the communists and the working class who will fail, but the enemies of the Communist Party and the working class! Due to Dimitrov's heroic defense, the support of the Soviet Union, and the pressure of the people of the world, the German court had to release the defendant. Dimitrov gained freedom and went to Moscow.

    In 1935, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, a position he held until May 1943, when the Communist International decided to dissolve itself. During this period, he made outstanding contributions to the establishment of the anti-fascist and anti-imperialist war people's front.

    In 1945, after the Soviet army's victory over Germany, Dimitrov ended his twenty-two years of exile and returned to his homeland on November 6 of that year. The Bulgarian people held an unprecedentedly grand welcome in history. In his first speech after returning to the country, he congratulated the Bulgarian people: "Twenty-two years have passed since I left Bulgarian soil. You will not doubt me if I tell you that during this entire period, no matter where I was, no matter what I did, I never stopped caring for the Bulgarian people, caring for their future, caring for their happiness and beautiful life, and I never stopped fighting for these for a minute." (Pages 55, 56 of this book) He answered the Bulgarian people's love for him with the same enthusiasm as a son to his mother. And over the years, the Bulgarian people have never forgotten their great son and leader for a moment.

    Under his leadership, Bulgaria became an advanced people's democratic country, laying a solid foundation for socialism. Dimitrov's report at the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party made a Marxist-Leninist scientific definition of the nature, role, and future of people's democratic countries, providing theoretical guiding principles for all people's democratic countries.

    Dimitrov was a true patriot and a great internationalist. He warmly advocated friendship with the Soviet Union and the solidarity of the working class all over the world. In his article "Fifteenth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China" written in June 1936, he said: "The Communist Party of China has proved itself loyal to the interests of the Chinese people in the past fifteen years, and has proved itself good at fighting for the interests and liberation of the Chinese people... We must give affectionate care and true spiritual and political support to the Chinese people who are waging a struggle for liberation... This great Chinese people is waging a struggle for their national independence and survival on one of the most serious fronts in the world's anti-fascist and anti-war front." In 1948, in his report to the Fifth National Congress of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist), Dimitrov again specifically pointed out the historical significance of the glorious victory of the liberation war won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China.

    Although Comrade Dimitrov has passed away, as his close comrade-in-arms and one of his successors, Chervenkov, swore before his coffin: "It is futile for the enemy to be happy about Dimitrov's death - his cause is now in strong, reliable hands." Dimitrov's cause is the cause of the working class, the cause of all peace-loving and democratic people, and the cause of communism. Let all those who support this cause read this book, and they will all receive very beneficial education and the power to move forward.

    向伟大的共产主义者季米特洛夫学习
    ——介绍“季米特洛夫—伟大的共产主义者”
    张子凡
    蒋齐生译    三联书店出版
    “季米特洛夫——伟大的共产主义者”一书原是一九四八年索非亚报纸管理部出版的一本没有作者署名的“季米特洛夫传”，经蒋齐生根据俄文本译成中文。译者还将“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报一九四九年七月十五日社论“国际工人运动的卓越活动家”和斯大林、联共（布）党及苏联政府各领导人为季米特洛夫的逝世所发布的讣告编在本书前头。此外在附录中还编入了“索非亚追悼季米特洛夫大会”、“保加利亚政府关于纪念季米特洛夫的决议”和刘宁一同志一九四七年写的一篇“我会见了季米特洛夫”。全书共一百五十五页。
    “季米特洛夫传”共分十四节（原书十一节，只写到一九四八年夏，中文译者续编了后三节），从季米特洛夫的幼年时代起，一直写到他的逝世。在这本小册子里，作者把这一代的巨人的光辉斗争历史和他英勇崇高的品格，用热情生动的笔法鲜明地描绘出来了。正如原作者所说的：“他（按指季米特洛夫）永远如一，他的一生和全部活动——就是一部斗争和憧憬光明未来的热烈的书。”（本书第十七页）真的，他的一生就是一部为共产主义事业奋斗的英雄史诗，对我们有深刻的教育意义和巨大的感召力。
    季米特洛夫于一八八二年六月十八日诞生于索非亚西南拉多米尔区柯瓦切维茨村的一个无产者的革命家庭里。他在十二岁时，为生活所迫不得不离开学校，当了印刷工人。排字的职业和求知的热望引起这个少年工人对书籍的狂热爱好。他十五岁时就成了索非亚印刷工人联合会的活动分子。他发表在“印刷工人报”上的第一篇论文，就是为了争取印刷工人在劳动中的卫生条件。有一次他曾坚决拒绝排出著名反动派拉多斯拉沃夫部长文章中攻击工人们组织庆祝五一节大会的几行。后来当季米特洛夫当选了国会议员，和拉多斯拉沃夫在国民议会上碰面时，拉多斯拉沃夫愤怒地向他喊道：“我早就知道你。你就是那个桀傲不逊的，还刚十五岁，就敢擅自改动我的文章的混小子。”季米特洛夫十八岁时，被选为印刷工人工会的书记。一九○二年他参加了保加利亚社会民主党。他站在以季米特利·布拉郭也夫为首的革命的马克思主义“紧密派”（保加利亚共产党的前身）一方，对修正主义进行了积极的斗争。党分裂后，他当了“紧密派”索非亚组织的书记。一九○五年，二十三岁的季米特洛夫被选为保加利亚革命的总工会书记，一直领导保加利亚的工人进行斗争。一九○九年起一直到他逝世，他一直是党中央委员会的委员。
    季米特洛夫受到保加利亚工人的热爱。有一次当他刚刚从监狱里出来，警察又因为他在一个矿工集会上演说而逮捕了他。但是当他被押送到索非亚，一走出火车的时候，示威的工人便把他从警察的手里夺走了。
    一九二○年末，季米特洛夫到俄国去参加共产国际第三届大会。他到会的第二天便会见了列宁。在同时召开的苏维埃职工会全国代表大会上，列宁把季米特洛夫介绍给斯大林。季米特洛夫便成了列宁和斯大林的最忠实的学生之一。
    由于他领导了保加利亚一九二三年的九月武装起义，反动政府曾缺席判处他死刑。在一九二六年保加利亚法西斯分子所组织的对共产党领导机关的审判会上，又一次对他作了死刑的缺席判决。在一九二三年他被迫流亡国外，过着职业革命家的生活，从此他成了国际著名的活动家。他曾在共产国际执委会中积极工作。
    这本册子的每一处都令人感奋，尤其是“莱比锡”这节。希特勒匪徒刚刚执政还不到一个月，就制造了“国会纵火案”的阴谋，企图打击和消灭共产党，逮捕并审讯季米特洛夫。季米特洛夫斥责和揭露了这一无耻的陷害阴谋，他的发言使真正的国会纵火者希特勒和戈林原形毕露。法庭庭长虽曾三十次打断他的演说，但他的代表真理的声音却使自己从一个被告变成了一个法官，把希特勒匪徒的真面目暴露于全世界人民之前。读了这一节，想着现在正在法国进行的迫害法国共产党及其领袖杜克洛的事件，真觉得历史好像又在“重演”。法国比内政府不正在执行着今天的法西斯主义继承者美帝国主义者所导演的同样把戏吗？但是历史终将判决，失败的将不是共产党人和工人阶级，而将是共产党和工人阶级的敌人！由于季米特洛夫英勇的抗辩，由于苏联的支援，和全世界人民的压力，德国法庭不得不将被告释放。季米特洛夫获得自由并去到莫斯科。
    一九三五年他被选为共产国际执行委员会总书记，他担任这个职位一直到一九四三年五月共产国际决定自行解散为止。这一时期，他为建立反法西斯及帝国主义战争的人民阵线作了杰出的贡献。
    在一九四五年苏军对德作战胜利后，季米特洛夫结束了他二十二年的流亡生活，于当年十一月六日回到了他的祖国。保加利亚人民举行了历史上空前的盛大欢迎。在他回国后的第一次演说中，他向保加利亚人民祝贺道：“从我离开保加利亚国土的时候起，已经过去二十二年了。你们不会怀疑，如果我向你们说，在这整个时期，无论我在什么地方，无论我干什么，我从来一分钟也没有停止关心保加利亚人民，关心它的将来，关心它的幸福与美满的生活，而且一分钟也没有停止为争取这些而斗争。”（本书第五五、五六页）他像儿子对母亲那样，热情洋溢地回答保加利亚人民对他的热爱。而这些年来保加利亚人民也没有一时一刻忘记他们这位伟大的儿子和领袖。
    保加利亚在他的领导之下，变成了一个先进的人民民主国家，为社会主义打下了稳固的基础。季米特洛夫在保共第五届大会上的报告，对人民民主国家的性质、作用和前途作了马列主义的科学的规定。给各人民民主国家提供了理论上的指导原则。
    季米特洛夫是一个真正的爱国主义者，又是一个伟大的国际主义者，他热烈主张对苏友好、对全世界工人阶级的团结。他在一九三六年六月写的“中国共产党十五周年纪念”一文中说：“中国共产党在十五年来已经证明自己忠实于中国人民的利益，并证明自己善于为中国人民的利益和解放而斗争，……必须对正在进行解放斗争的中国人民予以亲热的爱护和真正精神上、政治上的拥护。……这个伟大的中国人民正在全世界反法西斯主义与反战争战线的一个最严重的阵地上进行为自己民族独立生存的斗争。”一九四八年，在保加利亚工人党（共）第五次全国代表大会上的报告中，季米特洛夫又特别指出中国人民在伟大的中国共产党领导下所赢得的解放战争的光辉胜利的历史意义。
    季米特洛夫同志虽然逝世了，但是正如他的亲密的战友和继承人之一契尔文科夫在灵前宣誓中所说的那样：“敌人高兴季米特洛夫逝世是徒然的——他的事业现在掌握在强有力的、可靠的手中。”季米特洛夫的事业，就是工人阶级的事业，就是一切爱好和平民主人们的事业，就是共产主义的事业。让一切拥护这一事业的人来读读这本书吧，他们都将从这里得到非常有益的教育和前进的力量。
