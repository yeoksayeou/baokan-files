    People's Insurance Company of Pingyuan Branch
    Trials Well-Drilling Insurance
    In mid-May of this year, the Pingyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China experimentally launched well-drilling insurance services in the Liaocheng and Puyang areas of the province, greatly encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for drilling wells to combat drought.
    According to the situation in Liaocheng and Puyang areas, some farmers encounter unexpected situations during well-drilling and fail halfway, which leads to great difficulties in their production and life. They say: "If well-drilling fails, it will result in three 'holes': a useless well in the field, problems with food and drink at home, and inability to repay bank loans." Therefore, many farmers have reservations about well-drilling.
    In order to eliminate farmers' concerns about well-drilling, the insurance company's well-drilling insurance regulations stipulate: All brick wells, stone wells, bamboo springs, and wooden springs that are excavated for the purpose of irrigating farmland can be insured if the well owner explains the geological conditions of the well site and fills out an insurance list, which is then approved by the insurance company. The insurance period is from the start of construction to the date of completion (including the water testing period). The insurance amount includes the value of all materials required for well-drilling and the cost of food for workers throughout the entire project. The insurance premium is calculated at 5% of the insurance amount. Compensation regulations: If the wellbore or spring collapses during the construction period and cannot be rescued, or if quicksand or rock layers are encountered midway that prevent continued construction, compensation will be paid for actual losses of labor and materials within the limits of the insurance amount; If the well water depth and water yield are not up to standard after the well is completed, compensation will be paid for a part or all of the insurance amount according to different degrees.
    In carrying out well-drilling business, the insurance company has obtained the assistance of local county and district governments, and formed "Well-Drilling and Water Conservancy Work Groups" with the participation of Party and government officials and relevant technicians in each administrative village to help well owners solve technical problems in construction and provide great guarantees for well-drilling work.
    The launch of this new business by the insurance company has greatly encouraged farmers' confidence in well-drilling and drought prevention. According to statistics from ten counties in the Liaocheng area, before the People's Insurance Company of China launched well-drilling insurance, the original plan was to drill only 13,300 wells; after the launch of well-drilling insurance, it quickly increased to 18,623 wells, an increase of 40% over the original plan.
    The head office of the People's Insurance Company of China plans to gain experience in well-drilling insurance in the above-mentioned areas and then promote this business nationwide. (Du Zijie)

### 人民保险公司平原分公司  试办打井保险

    人民保险公司平原分公司
    试办打井保险
    中国人民保险公司平原省分公司，今年五月中旬在该省聊城、濮阳两专区试办了打井保险业务，大大鼓舞了农民打井抗旱的热情。
    根据聊城、濮阳两个专区的情况，有些农民因打井遇到意外的情况而中途失败后，在生产和生活上就会遭遇到很大的困难。他们说：“如果打井不成就要落三个‘窟窿’：地里一个废井，家里吃喝成问题，银行贷款还不清。”因此，不少农民对打井是有顾虑的。
    为了解除农民对于打井的顾虑，保险公司在打井保险办法中规定：凡是为了灌溉农田而开凿的砖井、石井、竹泉、木泉等，经由井主说明开井地点的地质情况并填写投保清单，经保险公司审查同意的，都可以保险。保险期限自开工之日起至全部完工之日为止（包括试水期在内）。保险额包括打井所需的一切材料价值及全部工程中工人的伙食费用。保险费按保险额百分之五计算。赔偿规定：在施工期内井筒或泉眼坍塌不能救援或中途遇有流沙或石层不能继续施工的，在保险额限度内，按实损工、料赔偿；打井完工后，如果井水深度与出水量不够标准，则按照不同程度分别赔付保险额的一部或全部。
    保险公司在开展打井业务中，曾取得当地县、区政府的协助，以各行政村为单位结合党、政和有关技术人员共同组成了“打井水利工作组”，帮助井主解决在施工上的技术问题，给予打井工作以很大保障。
    保险公司这一新的业务的开展，大大地鼓舞了农民对打井防旱的信心。据聊城专区十个县的统计，在中国人民保险公司举办打井保险以前，原计划只打井一万三千三百眼；而在举办打井保险以后，就迅速增至一万八千六百二十三眼，较原来计划增加了百分之四十。
    中国人民保险公司总公司拟在上述地区打井保险中取得经验后，普遍推广此项业务。（杜子杰）
