Mr. Chairman, fellow representatives:

We, the Tibetan representatives, are attending this "Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce" held in the capital of our People's Motherland with great excitement. Although we did not arrive in time for the opening of the meeting due to the long journey, only arriving yesterday on the ninth day of the agenda, we are extremely excited to be able to attend the grand closing ceremony of this meeting and to gather with the advanced representatives of industry and commerce from all fraternal nationalities across the country, reporting on situations and exchanging experiences with each other. First and foremost, we must thank the People's Government for their consideration; without the People's Government solving our transportation difficulties, we would not have been able to make it to this meeting.

The Tibetan people are part of the great family of all nationalities in China and have always been friendly with our fraternal nationalities. However, due to the continuous instigation of imperialism for over a century, the Tibetan people, whose limbs could not be separated, gradually lost the help of the nationalities of the motherland and suffered oppression and enslavement by imperialism. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Tibetan people were inspired by the great Chairman Mao's policy of national equality. After the Dalai Lama formally took power in 1950, he sent a Tibetan delegation headed by Aphe A-wang Jinmei to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and report on the suffering in the region. The long-awaited peaceful liberation of Tibet was realized following the signing of the seventeen-article agreement under the leadership of the Central People's Government. This made the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdini, and the vast masses of monks and laypeople in Tibet feel infinitely excited that they were beginning to embark on a happy life. This undoubtedly is a concrete and vivid reflection of the Tibetan people returning to the warm family of friendship and cooperation of all nationalities in the People's Republic of China. We deeply understand that Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party are truly our great saviors and liberators.

Last year, the People's Liberation Army passed through Xikang to the Front and Rear Tibet and Ali regions. They completely adhered to the principle of national equality, providing the Tibetan people with all friendly assistance and support, especially showing the Dalai Lama the utmost respect. In addition, they protected temples, strictly respected the customs and habits of Tibetan society and freedom of religious belief, did not live in civilian houses, did not take a needle or thread from the people, and conducted fair transactions. This is a vivid manifestation of the iron discipline of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and their love for the country and the people. Such a good army has truly never existed before. In order to improve the lives of the Tibetan people and enable the unimpeded prosperity of the economy, they have been developing wasteland and developing agricultural production in vast areas such as Lhasa, Gyantse, and Shigatse, regardless of hardship, with officers and soldiers working together. All of this makes the entire Tibetan clergy and laity feel respect and joy!

American imperialism extremely hates the revolutionary victory of the people of the motherland. When the People's Liberation Army began its march into Tibet in February 1951, it became exasperated and, reversing past practice, refused to purchase large quantities of Tibetan wool. This had a great impact on the economic life of Tibetan wool merchants, the vast pastoralists in northern Tibet, and merchants transporting goods along the route. Comrade Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and the leaders of the troops entering Tibet, were aware of the crisis in Tibetan commerce and immediately ordered the central trading agency in Tibet to purchase all the wool accumulated by Tibetan merchants on May 15 at a price of 184 shield rupees per burden, and to subsidize the capital of general medium and large merchants through order placement, enabling them to transform from a precarious situation to an active one. In terms of agricultural production, in addition to the PLA developing a large amount of land in various places, it also provided loans to poor farmers and solved the difficulty of obtaining seeds. In terms of transportation, the construction of some relatively important highways and many bridges and avenues has already begun. In terms of industry, not only have the old existing power generation machines been repaired and can generate electricity in the short term, but a larger power plant will also be built. All these facts fully demonstrate Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's extreme concern for the prosperity of Tibet's economy, the improvement of the Tibetan people's lives, and special consideration for the development of Tibet.

We would like to make a few requests:

(1) We hope that all local specialties of Tibet will be actively purchased and sold by the central trade agencies, and that all kinds of materials needed by the Tibetan people will be allocated as much as possible from neighboring provinces, saving foreign exchange.

(2) The demand for brick tea and golden tip tea produced in the Ya'an area of Xikang and tuo tea produced in the Lijiang area of Yunnan is very large in Tibet. The current supply is far from meeting the actual needs. It is urgently hoped that before the entire Kang-Tibet highway is completed, these teas will be temporarily transported to Tibet by sea to meet the urgent needs.

(3) Tibet's main products are wool, followed by leather. We hope to quickly open wool processing factories, woolen mill factories, leather factories, paper mills, and establish other small factories equipped with new machines.

All the imperialist plots against Tibet have been fatally struck and completely shattered by our people under the correct leadership of the Communist Party. We have the determination and confidence to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the policies and laws of the Central People's Government, cherish the motherland, consolidate the border defense of the motherland, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

The complete success of this meeting has resulted in the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the establishment of a nationwide organization of industry and commerce. We support and are willing to strive in accordance with the directions indicated by Chairman Chen Shutong in his opening speech at the preparatory representative meeting and by Director Chen Yun in his report, and are willing to work with the people of all fraternal nationalities across the country and the advanced national industrial and commercial circles to accelerate the prosperity of industry and commerce in Tibet, and to serve the economic construction and national defense construction of Tibet. We also hope that all representatives will often introduce us to valuable experiences and good methods. Finally, let us shout:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the People’s Republic of China!
Long live the great unity of all nationalities of China!
Long live the great leader of all nationalities—Chairman Mao!

### 在全国工商联筹备代表会议上西藏代表桂香巴·贡尕那嘉的发言

专栏：

    在全国工商联筹备代表会议上西藏代表桂香巴·贡尕那嘉的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    我们藏族的代表是满怀兴奋地出席这在人民祖国首都召开的“中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议”的。虽然由于路途的遥远，没有及时地赶到会议的开幕，在昨天已是第九天的日程时才来到，但我们能够赶到参加本会议的隆重闭幕仪式，并能与全国先进的各兄弟民族工商业代表先生们齐集一堂，互相报告情况和交换经验，真是感到无限地兴奋。这首先不能不让我们感谢人民政府的照顾，没有人民政府给我们解决交通上的困难，我们是不可能赶上这次会议的。
    藏族人民是整个中国各民族大家庭的一部分，和兄弟民族人民自来都是友爱的，后来由于百多年来帝国主义的不断进行挑拨离间，致使手足不能分离的西藏人民逐渐地失掉了祖国各民族的帮助，受帝国主义的压迫和奴役。中华人民共和国成立后，西藏人民受到了伟大的毛主席的民族平等政策的感召，达赖喇嘛于一九五○年正式掌握政权后，就选派阿沛·阿旺晋美为首的西藏代表团到北京，向毛主席致敬和报告地方痛苦情况，西藏人民渴望已久的和平解放，因在中央人民政府领导下签订十七条办法的协议而跟着实现了，这使达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及西藏广大僧、俗人民群众，莫不感到开始走上幸福的生活而无限地兴奋。这无疑是西藏人民回到中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作的温暖的大家庭的具体生动的反映。我们深刻地体会到毛主席和中国共产党真正是我们的大救星和解放者。
    去年人民解放军经过西康到了前后藏和阿里地区，他们完全遵守民族平等的原则，给予藏族人民一切友爱的帮助和支持，特别是对达赖喇嘛始终是无上的尊重。此外，如保护寺庙，严格尊重西藏社会的风俗习惯和宗教信仰自由，不住民房，不拿人民一针一线，买卖公平等。这是中国人民解放军的铁的纪律和爱国家爱人民的生动的表现。这样好的军队真是从来没有过的。他们为了改善西藏人民的生活并能无阻碍地繁荣经济，特在拉萨、江孜、日喀则等广大地区，不辞艰苦，官兵一致地开发荒地，发展农业生产，在在都使西藏全体僧俗人民感到敬佩和愉快！
    美帝国主义极端仇视祖国人民的革命胜利。当一九五一年二月解放军开始进军西藏时，它竟恼羞成怒，一反以往成例，拒绝购买西藏出产的大宗羊毛。这使西藏羊毛商，西藏北部广大牧民以及沿途的运输商人等，都受到经济生活上的极大影响。我中央人民政府张经武代表和入藏部队的首长们，都感到西藏商业的危机，当即命令中央在西藏的贸易机关于五月十五日，以一闷作价一八四盾芦比，将藏商所存积的羊毛全部收购并对一般大中商人，用订货方式，补助他们的资本，使他们由垂危的状况转到活跃。在农业生产方面，除解放军在各地大量开发土地外，并对贫苦农民贷款和解决种籽的困难。在交通方面，已开始修建比较重要的一些公路及许多桥梁和大道。在工业方面，不但已经把以前旧有的发电机器修好了，短期内可以发电，而且还要建立一个较大的发电厂。所有这些事实，充分证明了毛主席和中央人民政府，对繁荣西藏经济，改善西藏人民生活的极为关怀，以及对发展西藏的特别照顾。
    我们提出几点希望：
    （一）西藏地方所有的土特产，请由中央贸易机关大力收售，西藏人民所需各种物资，亦请尽量由邻省调配，节省外汇。
    （二）西康雅安一带出产的砖茶、金尖茶和云南丽江一带出产的沱茶，在西藏的需要数量很大，现在供给远不能适应实际的需要，迫切希望在康藏公路全段未修筑完竣前，这些茶叶暂时经由海道运往西藏，以济急需。
    （三）西藏地方以出产羊毛为大宗，其次为皮革。我们希望迅速开办羊毛加工厂，制呢厂，制革厂，制纸厂并建立装备着新式机器的其他小型工厂。
    帝国主义对于西藏的一切阴谋，我们全国人民在共产党的正确领导下已予以致命的打击，而完全粉碎了。我们有决心也有信心坚决执行毛主席的指示和中央人民政府的政策法令，爱护祖国，巩固祖国的边防，建设繁荣幸福的新西藏。
    这次会议的圆满成功，已经产生了中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，建立了工商界的全国性组织。我们拥护并愿意遵照陈叔通主席在筹备代表会议开幕词中和陈云主任在他的报告中所指示的方向而努力奋斗，并愿与全国各兄弟民族人民和先进的全国工商界一道，把西藏地方的工商业加速繁荣起来，为西藏地方的经济建设和国防建设而服务。也希望诸位代表先生们把宝贵的经验和好的方法经常介绍给我们。最后让我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中华各民族人民大团结万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖——毛主席万岁！
