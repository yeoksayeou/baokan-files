	Miracle on the Transportation Line
	Tian Chengji
	This May, the automotive heroes of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region, driving ten vehicles, carrying machinery for the construction of the motherland's frontier, created an unprecedented miracle of transport on the four-thousand-kilometer transportation line from a certain location to Dihua.

	The task of transporting the machinery was undertaken by twenty heroes, including Deputy Instructor Liu Juyi, Deputy Platoon Leader Niu Baoquan, and model drivers He Chao, Tian Yuan, Li Taihe, Zhai Hongfan, and Fang Weiyao. These heroes loved the motherland and were dedicated to the construction of the frontier. They possessed a high degree of political awareness. They often said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can only conquer difficulties; difficulties can never scare us. We must emulate the heroes of the Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield." The machinery they were responsible for transporting this time was, in some cases, as long as eighteen feet and as high as eight feet. Each piece of machinery typically weighed seven tons, with some reaching nine tons. The machinery could not be disassembled for transport; however, the vehicles had a carrying capacity of only four tons, and the ten-foot-long truck beds were too short to accommodate the load. This was indeed a very tricky task. However, all difficulties were overcome under the heroic slogan of "Everyone uses their brains, offers suggestions, and finds solutions." They attached a trailer to the back of the truck, like a train, installed tooth packs and bottom shafts, and added two tires to increase the vehicle's load-bearing surface. They called this vehicle the "self-made eight-wheeled heavy-duty truck."

	During the journey, the vehicles often encountered bridges that they could not cross because of the excessive load. The heroes used shovels and pickaxes to build detours, overcoming this difficulty and continuing their journey. They became anxious when crossing the Yellow River Iron Bridge in the northern suburbs of Lanzhou. The Yellow River Iron Bridge could only handle vehicles weighing ten tons, and it had already exceeded its service life several years prior. If they did not take the Yellow River Iron Bridge, they would not be able to complete their mission. Therefore, upon arriving in Lanzhou, they discussed solutions with the person in charge of managing the Yellow River Iron Bridge. After repeated calculations, they adjusted the vehicle's load focus, and the vehicles began to pass. To prevent accidents, pedestrian traffic was prohibited on the Yellow River Iron Bridge. When the first vehicle climbed onto the Iron Bridge, the noise of the crowd suddenly stopped, and everyone held their breath, silently praying for the vehicle's safe passage. When the first vehicle reached the north bank of the Yellow River, cheers thundered from both banks of the Yellow River. The remaining nine vehicles also crossed the Iron Bridge one by one amidst the cheers of the masses.

	The Longnan Daba Mountains, the Longxi Huajia Ridge, the Wuqiaoling Ridge in the Gansu Corridor, and the Tianshan Mountains within Xinjiang are all known for their险峻, with slopes ranging from twenty to thirty degrees. Here, even if the vehicles were not overloaded, driving would be difficult. Yet, they were driving vehicles that were overloaded by more than double their capacity, with long beds that were inconvenient for maneuvering. When the vehicles went uphill using the maximum power of first gear, they would sometimes slide backward; it would be very dangerous if the vehicle could not brake. In this situation, each driving assistant held a triangular wedge weighing ten to twenty pounds, closely following the vehicle's rear wheels, placing it one step at a time. The assistants' backs ached, and they were covered in sweat, but they did not feel tired. In this way, traveling at a speed of four to five kilometers per hour, they safely crossed four or five large mountains, each thirty to forty kilometers long. The slogans "Let the factories start production as soon as possible" and "Dedicate all our strength to the motherland" inspired the heroes to overcome numerous difficulties and complete their mission. Along the way, for the safety of the vehicles, the assistants formed strong combat teams, guarding the front and rear in deep mountain valleys. To ensure timely repairs in case of vehicle damage, the drivers formed a self-repair team, and a temporary repair factory would be set up whenever a vehicle malfunctioned.

	The heroes deeply understood the great role these machines would play in the construction of the frontier, so their care for the machines was meticulous. While crossing the towering mountains, even though it was May or June, they often encountered heavy snow and rainstorms. To prevent the machines from getting damp and rusty, they used their own clothes and quilts to cover every torn spot on the machine tarpaulins. In this way, after a month, these ten vehicles finally arrived safely in Dihua.

	Under the heroes' careful maintenance, not a single tire burst, and not a single steel plate broke on these ten vehicles. Driver Fang Weiyao also saved fifty-nine gallons of gasoline. Each vehicle reduced the state's fixed cost quota by an average of nearly fourteen percent.

    运输线上的奇迹
    田承基
    今年五月，新疆军区某部汽车英雄们，驾驶着十辆汽车，载负着建设祖国边疆的机器，由某地驶向迪化，在长达四千多公里的运输线上，创造了空前未有的装运奇迹。
    载运机器的任务，是由副指导员刘居义、副排长牛保全和模范驾驶员何超、田渊、李太和、翟洪范、方维耀等二十名英雄承担起来的。英雄们热爱祖国，忠实于边疆的建设事业，他们有着高度的政治觉悟。他们常说：“在共产党、毛主席的领导下，只有我们征服困难，困难绝不能吓倒我们。我们要向朝鲜战场上的志愿军英雄看齐。”这次他们负责装运的机器，有的长达一丈八尺，有的高达八尺以上；每件机器的重量普通是七吨，有的达到九吨。机器不能拆卸装运；然而车辆的载重力只有四吨，仅长一丈的车箱也装载不下。这确是一个很棘手的工作。但是，所有的困难都在“人人动脑筋，出主意，想办法”的英雄口号下克服了。他们在车身后面像火车一样接上一个车箱，装上牙齿包和底轴，加上两个轮胎，使车辆负荷面加大。他们称这种车为“自造八轮载重车”。
    汽车在行驶途中，因为载重量过重，遇到桥梁常常无法通过。英雄们用铁锹、十字镐修出便道，战胜了这种困难，继续行驶。在兰州北郊过黄河铁桥时，他们心焦起来了。黄河铁桥只能通过载重十吨的汽车，并且早在几年以前就超过了使用年限。如不取道黄河铁桥，就无法完成任务。因此，他们在抵达兰州时，就和管理黄河铁桥的负责人商量办法。经过再三的计算，调整了车辆的负荷重点，车子开始通行。为了防止意外，黄河铁桥上禁止行人通过。当第一辆车爬上铁桥时，人群的嘈杂声突然停息了，大家都屏住气，默祝车辆安全通过。当第一辆车到达黄河北岸时，黄河两岸欢声雷动。其余的九辆车，也一辆一辆地在群众欢呼声中驰过了铁桥。
    陇南大巴山，陇西华家岭，甘肃走廊乌稍岭，新疆境内的天山……，都以险峻著名，山的坡度都在二十度到三十度左右。在这里，汽车即使不超过载重量，行驶起来也有困难。而他们却驾驶着重量超装一倍以上、车箱很长、不便行驶的车辆。汽车用最大力量的第一档上坡，有时也会向后倒退；车如果刹不住，是非常危险的。在这种情况下，每个驾驶助手都抱着一、二十斤重的三角锤形掩木，紧跟着车辆的后轮，一步一垫。助手们腰躬得酸痛，汗流满面，但他们并不感到疲惫。这样以每小时行驶四、五公里的速度，安全地越过四、五个都是长达三、四十公里的大山。“让工厂早日开工”，“把一切力量献给祖国”的口号，鼓舞着英雄们克服重重困难，完成任务。沿途，为了车辆的安全，助手们组成了坚强的战斗小组，每到深山夹谷中，前后警卫。为了车辆损坏后能及时修复，驾驶员们组成了自修小组，车辆一出毛病，一个临时的修理工厂就开工了。
    英雄们深深了解到这些机器，在边疆建设中的伟大作用，所以他们对机器的爱护是无微不至的。在通过层层高山时，虽然是五、六月的天气，但经常还会碰到大雪暴雨。为了不使机器受潮生锈，他们用自己的衣服和被子，遮盖机器篷布上的每一个破烂的地方。就这样，在一个月以后，这十辆汽车终于安全地到达了迪化。
    这十辆汽车，在英雄们细心的保管下，没爆一只轮胎，没断一片钢板。驾驶员方维耀还节余了汽油五十九加仑。每部汽车平均为国家降低定额成本百分之十四弱。
