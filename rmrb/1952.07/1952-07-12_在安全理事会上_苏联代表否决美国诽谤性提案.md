    At the Security Council
    Soviet Representative Vetoes Slanderous American Proposal

    [News from this paper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The United Nations Security Council continues to hold meetings. The American representative, at the July 3rd meeting, once again put forward a provocative and slanderous proposal, insisting that someone had fabricated accusations against the United States for engaging in bacteriological warfare, and suggesting that the Security Council condemn the so-called acts of collecting and disseminating such remarks.

    At the 8th meeting, Soviet representative Malik spoke (full text of speech attached), denouncing the slanderous American proposal.

    In the consecutive days of meetings, the representatives of Greece, the Netherlands, France, and Brazil spoke in support of the American proposal.

    Pakistani representative Bokhari said: When the American proposal is put to a vote, his government has decided to abstain. He said: If these accusations are proven to be true, it would mean that the people of Asia have become victims of an unprecedented and horrific crime.

    Chilean representative Cruz said: If the American proposal is adopted, it would further exacerbate international tensions. However, Cruz also said that Chile will vote in favor of the proposal when it is put to a vote because the Security Council has a "moral responsibility" to support the "United Nations" forces in Korea.

    The Security Council voted on the American proposal at the 9th meeting. Nine delegations voted in favor. The Pakistani representative abstained. The Soviet representative voted against. The American proposal failed to pass because it did not receive the concurring affirmative votes of the five permanent members.

    在安全理事会上
    苏联代表否决美国诽谤性提案
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：联合国安全理事会继续举行会议。美国代表曾在七月三日会议上，又提出了一项挑拨性和诽谤性的提案，硬说有人无中生有地指责美国进行细菌战，而建议安全理事会对于所谓搜集和散播这种言论的行为予以谴责。
    在八日会议上，苏联代表马立克发言（发言全文附后），揭斥了美国诽谤性的提案。
    在连日会议上，希腊、荷兰、法国及巴西代表发言支持美国提案。
    巴基斯坦代表鲍卡利发言说：在美国提案付表决时，他的政府决定弃权。他说：如果这些指责经证明属实，这就意味着亚洲人民已成为空前未有的恐怖罪行的受难者。
    智利代表克鲁兹说：如果通过美国的提案，那就会使国际紧张局势更进一步恶化。但是，克鲁兹又说，在表决时智利将赞成这个提案，因为安全理事会“在道义上有责任”支持在朝鲜的“联合国”军。
    安全理事会在九日会议上表决美国提案。九个代表团投赞成票。巴基斯坦代表弃权。苏联代表投反对票。美国提案因为没有得到五常任理事国一致的可决票，未获得通过。
