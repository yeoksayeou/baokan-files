    The Wang Meilian Silkworm Raising Group in Northern Jiangsu Creates New Record

    Editor: Using new methods to raise silkworms can greatly increase production. The Wang Meilian Silkworm Raising Group in Jiannan Village, Eryang Township, Gaozuo District, Jianhu County, Northern Jiangsu is a very good example. This group has a total of seven people. They accepted the technical guidance of the Sericulture Guidance Station and implemented appropriate division of labor based on the strengths of each group member: four people picked mulberry leaves, and three people tended to the silkworms. At night, everyone took turns on duty, with the lights on all night and no one leaving. They also improved silkworm raising equipment and methods. As a result, the silkworms they raised from one silkworm egg sheet produced 96 catties of cocoons, exceeding the planned output by more than double, creating the highest silkworm production record in the county.

    When this group was first established, some people did not believe in the new technology and said sarcastic things to them. Now these people say: "The new method is indeed better than the old method. The cocoons are more abundant, whiter, and harder. The People's Government is really capable!"

    苏北王美连养蚕小组创造新纪录
    编辑同志：用新的方法养蚕，可以大大提高产量。苏北建湖县高作区二扬乡建南村王美连养蚕小组，就是一个很好的榜样。这个小组共有七个人。他们接受了蚕桑指导所的技术指导，根据每个组员的特长，实行了适当的分工，四个人采桑叶，三个人侍蚕。夜里大家轮流值班，通夜不熄灯、不离人。他们还改进了养蚕设备和养蚕方法。结果，他们养的一张蚕子，结茧九十六斤，超过计划产量一倍以上，创造了全县产蚕的最高纪录。
    这个小组初成立时，有些群众还不相信新技术，对他们说讽刺话。现在这些人说：“新法确比旧法好，蚕茧结得又多、又白、又硬，人民政府真行哩！”  成席持  倪超
