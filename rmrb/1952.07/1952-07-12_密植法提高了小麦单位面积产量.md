The Shuangqiao Practice Farm of the Mechanized Farming School directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has learned from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union and implemented the close planting method for wheat, achieving a bumper harvest. This is a significant event. It will greatly promote the increase of wheat yield per unit area throughout China.

The experience of Shuangqiao Practice Farm proves that planting the same seeds on land with the same conditions, with all other field management work being exactly the same, simply shortening the row spacing and implementing the close planting method, can increase wheat production by 122 jin per mu, an increase of about one time compared to sparse planting. If this experience can be widely promoted, so that wheat fields across the country can increase production by about one time per mu, what an amazing thing that would be!

Since 1949, under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the specific assistance of Soviet agronomist expert Lysenko, Shuangqiao Practice Farm has successively adopted advanced Soviet production experiences such as deep plowing and close planting, and the large-field grassland rotation system, which not only fully utilizes land fertility, but also scientifically cultivates it. Therefore, the farm's cotton and wheat yields have increased year by year.

This year, the farm's wheat has achieved a bumper harvest due to the implementation of the close planting method, even in the context of scarce rain and snow last winter and this spring. The yield in high-yield areas reached as high as 416 jin per mu. The total output of the farm's 259 mu of wheat land this year reached more than 47,200 jin. This includes the yield of both close-planted and sparsely planted wheat land, with close-planted land (15 cm row spacing) of 93 mu producing a total of 24,238 jin, and sparsely planted land (45 cm row spacing) of 166 mu producing a total of 22,998 jin. The average yield per mu of close-planted land is 260.6 jin, while the average yield per mu of sparsely planted land is 138.5 jin. The yield of close-planted land is about twice that of sparsely planted land, which fully demonstrates the superiority of the close planting method. As for the wheat land operated by ordinary farmers near the farm, the average yield this year is only 89.6 jin per mu, with the highest being 140 jin and the lowest being only 35 jin.

"The achievements and experience of Shuangqiao Practice Farm in learning from the Soviet experience and implementing close wheat planting in the first two years also proved that close planting is better than sparse planting," said the farm's comrades. In 1949, Soviet agronomist expert Lysenko came to China and brought the advanced experience of close planting. However, because everyone was deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese sparse planting method of "wide rows and large ridges, ventilation and light," they were not completely convinced of the Soviet close planting experience. Some people even said without any basis: "The Soviet close planting method may only be suitable for the unique soil and climate conditions of the Soviet Union, while the soil and climate conditions of China have always been accustomed to sparse planting." Therefore, when Shuangqiao Practice Farm sowed wheat in the autumn of 1949, it only initially narrowed the row spacing (from 60 cm to 30 cm) and did not fully implement close planting. However, this "initial narrowing of row spacing" for close planting immediately achieved significant results. That year, the wheat of farmers near the farm mostly developed rust disease, while the farm's wheat did not develop rust disease because it was planted more densely. In terms of yield, the farmers' wheat land yielded only 50-60 jin per mu, while the farm's yielded 100.25 jin per mu. The farm harvested more than 80% more per mu than the farmers. When sowing in the autumn of 1950, Shuangqiao Practice Farm officially implemented the close planting method, with all wheat land having a row spacing of 15 cm, and the results were even more significant, with yields much higher than those of local farmers. Due to the influence of the climate (spring drought and spring cold), last year the wheat land of farmers near the farm yielded a maximum of only 45 jin per mu, and a minimum of only 20-30 jin, while the farm's 514 mu of wheat land yielded an average of 106 jin per mu, an average increase of 5 jin per mu compared to the previous year, and 1.37 times more than nearby farmers. In terms of the year's conditions, the climate and rainfall conditions received during the growth of this year's wheat were far inferior to those of the previous year, but the yield not only did not decrease but increased, which is the result of implementing close planting. From then on, all employees of Shuangqiao Practice Farm were completely convinced of the advanced production experience of the Soviet wheat close planting method. The reason why Shuangqiao Practice Farm still used the sparse planting method with a row spacing of 45 cm for 166 mu of wheat land when sowing wheat last autumn was because this part of the wheat land was originally a grassland large-field rotation area. The farm originally only planned to use the fallow land to plant some wheat before sowing alfalfa, and then plant alfalfa between the rows of wheat when the rainfall was suitable. Later, because it had not received appropriate rainfall, the alfalfa could not be sown, and the alfalfa intercropping land thus became the current sparse wheat planting area. This unexpected simultaneous comparison of the different yields of close planting and sparse planting even more clearly proved the superiority of the close planting method.

According to the field survey conducted by the farm before the wheat harvest, close-planted wheat has more tillers, longer ears, heavier ears, and more and stronger wheat grains, so the yield is high. Among the 93 mu of close-planted wheat land, half a mu of wheat land had been watered during the tillering and flowering stages of the spring wheat, and was therefore called "high-yield close-planted land," and its situation was even better. Now, let's take a look at the comparison of the yields of ordinary close planting and sparse planting in the field survey table made by the farm:

Close planting has 308 wheat ears per square meter, while sparse planting has only 193; the average number of tillers per plant for close planting is 2.38, while the average number of tillers for sparse planting is 1.94; the average weight per ear for close planting is 1.06 grams, while the average weight per ear for sparse planting is only 0.91 grams; each ear of close planting has 20.9 grains of wheat, and sparse planting also has 20.9 grains, while the weight of 1,000 grains of close planting is 30.85 grams, while sparse planting is only 28.85 grams. Therefore, the average yield per mu of close planting (excluding the high-yield close planting area) reaches 260.6 jin, while the average yield per mu of sparse planting is only 138.5 jin, that is, close planting yields 122.1 jin more per mu than sparse planting. The farm's field survey table simultaneously specifically indicates that the wheat of these two planting methods has the same variety, sowing time, germination rate, and growth conditions such as soil and water; the amount of fertilizer applied is the same: 2,000 jin of manure per mu and 50 jin of chemical fertilizer calcium cyanamide, but the yield of close planting is much higher. From here, we can see how significant the implementation of the close planting method in learning from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union is for increasing wheat yield per unit area.

Even during the growth process, the advantages and disadvantages of close planting and sparse planting are very clear. When reporters went to visit, the comrades of the farm all said: close-planted wheat has wide leaves, green color, and thick stalks, and the tillers are neat; while sparse-planted wheat has narrow leaves, yellow color, and thin stalks, and the tillers are uneven. When talking about the neat tillers of close planting, Deputy Farm Manager Fan took a specimen collected from the close-planted wheat land and showed it to the reporter. He said excitedly: "I have never seen such good wheat, with so many effective tillers, so neat, all 20 ears on the whole plant are the same height!"

The survey of soil moisture content and weed growth in the close-planted and sparse-planted wheat areas conducted by the State Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government at Shuangqiao Practice Farm illustrates the benefits of close planting from another aspect: measuring 10 cm from the soil surface downward, the moisture content of both the close-planted area and the sparse-planted area is 7.9%; measuring 11-30 cm downward, the moisture content of the close-planted area is 7%, and the moisture content of the sparse-planted area is 6.4%; measuring 31-50 cm downward, the moisture content of the close-planted area is 10.2%, and the sparse-planted area is only 8.3%. In terms of weed growth: within each square meter, the close-planted area has only 0.2 weeds, while the sparse-planted area has 5.8 weeds. The above shows that soil moisture does not evaporate more due to the close planting of crops. On the contrary, weeds grow less because of the close planting of crops.

"So why can close planting make crops grow better? Is there any scientific basis for this?" When the reporter raised this question, the comrades said: "We had not considered such questions before, but in recent years, through the practical experience of close planting and bumper harvests, we have also realized its theoretical basis."

He said that the reason is very simple: first, close planting can make crops evenly distributed and fully utilize soil nutrients, so that wheat can better play its tillering role, the wheat grows strong, and the disease resistance is enhanced. This is the reason why close-planted wheat has more tillers, grows well and is not prone to rust disease and does not grow weeds. Second, wheat is a deep-rooted crop among Gramineae crops, and its roots extend downward to a total of six to eight feet. It can extend straight downward to absorb nutrients from the ground. Third, because all soil nutrients are absorbed by the wheat, weeds have no way to grow, and there is no need for cultivation, so there is no need to leave wide rows and large ridges for the field activities of cultivators. If wide rows and large ridges are left, it is a complete waste of land fertility. Therefore, wheat itself is originally a crop only suitable for close planting.

When criticizing China's traditional so-called sparse planting method of "wide rows and large ridges, ventilation and light," Comrade Fan Xizhong summarized the following conclusion from practical experience: China's traditional sparse planting method is the most unscientific. The rows are very sparse, and the wheat grains in each row are crowded together, which affects tillering, and in fact cannot ventilate or let light through. Although our close planting row spacing is small, the wheat grains in each row are roughly single-row, and the wheat grains maintain a relatively uniform distance (about two or three centimeters), each wheat seed can get sufficient nutrients, fully tiller, and is truly ventilated and lets light through.

    密植法提高了小麦单位面积产量
    新华社记者    李蓬茵
    中央人民政府农业部直属机耕学校双桥实习农场学习苏联先进生产经验，实行小麦密植法，得到了丰收，这是一件意义重大的事件。它对于全中国小麦单位面积产量的提高将发生极大的推动作用。
    双桥实习农场的经验证明，将同样的种籽，播种在同样条件的土地上，其他田间管理工作也完全一样，只是缩短行距，实行密植法，就能使每亩小麦增产一百二十二斤，较稀植增产约一倍。这个经验如能普遍推广，使全国的麦田都能做到每亩约增产一倍，将是如何惊人的一件事啊。
    双桥实习农场，在中央人民政府农业部的直接领导和农业部顾问苏联农学专家卢森科的具体帮助下，自一九四九年以来先后接受了苏联的深耕密植，牧草大田轮作制等先进生产经验，既充分地使用了地力，又科学地培养着地力，因此该场棉花和麦子的产量一年比一年高。
    今年该场的小麦，又由于实行了密植法，虽在去冬今春雨雪稀少的情况下，仍获得了丰收。丰产地每亩产量高达四百十六斤。全场二百五十九亩麦地今年的总产量达到四万七千二百多斤。其中包括密植、稀植两种植法的麦地的产量，计密植地（行距十五公分）九十三亩共产二万四千二百三十八斤，稀植地（行距四十五公分）一百六十六亩共产二万二千九百九十八斤。密植地的每亩平均产量是二六○点六斤，稀植地的每亩平均产量是一三八点五斤，密植地的产量约为稀植地的产量的二倍，这就充分说明了密植法的优越性。至于该场附近一般农民所经营的麦地，今年每亩平均只有八十九点六斤，最高的一百四十斤，最少的只有三十五斤。
    “双桥实习农场在学习苏联经验，实行小麦密植的头两年的成果和经验，也证明了密植比稀植好。”该场同志说。一九四九年，苏联农学专家卢森科来到了中国，带来了密植的先进经验。只因当时大家接受中国传统的“宽行大垅，通风通光”的稀植耕作法的影响很深，对于苏联的密植经验还不是完全相信的。有的人甚至毫无根据地说：“苏联的密植法，或者只适宜于苏联特有的土壤和气候条件，而中国的土壤和气候条件，则是历来就习惯于稀植的。”因此，双桥实习农场在一九四九年秋季播种小麦时，只是初步地缩小了行距（由六十公分改为三十公分），而没有放手实行密植。但是这种“初步缩小行距”的密植，也立即获得了显著的效果。这一年，农场附近农民的麦子大都长了锈病，农场的麦子因为种得比较密却没有长锈病。产量方面，附近农民的麦地每亩只收五、六十斤，而农场的每亩却收得一百点二五斤。农场每亩地较农民多收八成以上。一九五○年秋播时，双桥实习农场正式实行密植法，全部麦地行距一律改为十五公分，成绩就更加显著，产量较当地农民高得更多了。由于气候（春旱春寒）的影响，去年该场附近农民的麦地最多每亩只收四十五斤，最低的只有二、三十斤，而农场的五百十四亩麦地却平均每亩收得一百零六斤，较前年每亩平均增产五斤，较附近农民更多收一点三七倍。以年景来说，这一届麦子生长过程中所得到的气候雨水条件都远不如上一年的，而产量不但没有减少，反而增加了，这就是实行密植的成果。从此，双桥实习农场的全体职工对于苏联小麦密植法的先进生产经验就完全信服了。去年秋季播麦时，双桥实习农场所以仍有一百六十六亩麦地采用了行距四十五公分的稀植法，是由于这一部分麦地本是牧草大田轮作区，该场原来只计划在苜蓿播种之前利用休闲地种些小麦，待雨水适宜时再在麦子行间种植苜蓿，后来因为一直没有得到适当的雨水，苜蓿未能下种，苜蓿间作地却因而成为现在的小麦稀植区。这次意外地同时得到密植、稀植两种不同的收获量来作比较，就更加明显地证明了密植法的优越性。
    据该场在麦收前所作田间调查显示：密植的麦子分蘖多，穗儿长，穗子重，麦粒多而壮实，因此产量高。在九十三亩密植麦地中，有半亩麦地曾在春季小麦分蘖期及扬花期分别浇过水，因而被称为“密植丰产地”的，其情形就更好。现在，请看一看该场所作田间调查表中普通密植和稀植两项产量的比较吧：
    密植的每平方公尺有麦穗三百零八个，而稀植的只有一百九十三个；密植的每株平均分蘖数是二点三八，而稀植的平均分蘖数是一点九四；密植的每穗平均重量有一点○六公分，而稀植的只有○点九一公分；密植的每穗有麦粒二十点九粒，稀植的也有二十点九粒，而密植的每千粒重三十点八五克，而稀植的只有二十八点八五克。因此，密植的每亩平均产量（丰产密植区除外）达二六○点六斤，稀植的每亩平均产量只有一百三十八点五斤，即密植较稀植每亩产量高出一百二十二点一斤。该场田间调查表同时具体指明：这两种种植法的麦子，其品种、播种时间、发芽率以及生长条件如土壤、水分都相同；施肥量同是每亩厩肥二千斤，化学肥料石灰氮五十斤，而密植的产量高得多。从这里就可以看到，学习苏联先进生产经验实行密植法对于提高小麦单位面积产量具有多么重大的意义。
    就是在生长过程中，密植、稀植两种作法的优劣也很分明。当记者前往访问时，该场的工作同志都这样说：密植的，叶子宽，颜色绿，麦杆也粗，分蘖整齐；而稀植的则叶子狭，颜色黄，杆儿细，分蘖参差不齐。在说到密植的分蘖整齐时，该场范副场长拿了一株从密植麦地采来的标本给记者看，他十分兴奋地说：“我从来没有看见过这样好的麦子，有效分蘖这样多，这样整齐，全株二十个麦穗都一般儿高！”
    中央人民政府农业部国营农场管理局在双桥实习农场密植、稀植两种麦区所作麦地含水量和杂草生长情况的调查，从另一个方面说明了密植法的好处：从土面向下测量十公分，密植区与稀植区的含水量都是百分之七点九；向下测量十一至三十公分，密植区含水量为百分之七，稀植区为百分之六点四；向下测量三十一至五十公分，密植区含水量为百分之十点二，稀植区只有百分之八点三。杂草生长方面：每平方公尺内，密植区仅有杂草零点二株，而稀植区却有杂草五点八株。以上说明，土壤水分不因作物密植而蒸发多，相反地，杂草却因为作物的密植而长得少。
    “那么为什么密植就能够使作物长得更好呢？这有什么科学根据吗？”当记者提出这个问题的时候，工作同志说：“这样的问题在以前我们并没有考虑过，但是这几年通过密植丰收的实际经验，我们同时认识到了它的理论根据。”
    他说，道理很简单：第一，密植能够使作物分布均匀，充分利用土壤养分，以使小麦更能发挥分蘖作用，麦子长得壮，抗病力就增强。这就是密植的小麦所以分蘖多，长得好而不易生锈病和不生杂草的原因。第二，小麦在禾本科作物中是深根作物，它的根子向下伸展共达六尺至八尺。它能够直线向下伸展以吸收地中养分。第三，小麦因土壤养分全被吸收，杂草就无从生长了，用不着中耕，所以也就用不着留下宽行大垅作为耕作者田间活动之用。如果留下宽行大垅，那就完全是对地力的浪费了。因此，小麦本身原来是一种只适宜于密植的作物。
    在批判我国传统的所谓“宽行大垅，通风通光”的稀植耕作法时，范希中同志从实际体验中总结出了这样的结论，就是：中国传统的稀植法最不科学，行与行很稀，而每行的麦粒却挤在一起，影响分蘖，实际上不能通风通光。我们密植行距虽小，每行麦粒大体上是单行，麦粒保持着较匀的距离（约二、三公分），每粒麦种都可得到充分的养分，充分分蘖，而且是真正通风通光的。
