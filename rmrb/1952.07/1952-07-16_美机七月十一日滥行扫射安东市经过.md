Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 15th: This reporter reports on the incident of American aircraft indiscriminately strafing Antung citizens and killing our peaceful people on July 11th, stating: After the bloody incident of American aircraft indiscriminately strafing Antung citizens occurred, the reporter rushed to the scene and conducted detailed investigations with the families of the victims, the injured, and many citizens who witnessed the American aircraft strafing. It was confirmed that there were two batches of American aircraft that invaded the airspace of Antung City on July 11th: The first batch of eight American aircraft invaded the airspace of Antung City at 1:57 PM; the second batch of four American aircraft invaded the airspace of Antung City again at 5:23 PM. Both batches of American aircraft carried out barbaric strafing over Antung City, resulting in a total of fifty residents injured and two deaths in the most densely populated areas of the city, including Qidao Street, Renzhong Street, Yujia Street, Badao Street, and Jubao Street.

Yu Jiqing, a staff member of the city's Third District, who personally witnessed the American aircraft strafing, recounted the situation at the time: "When the air raid siren sounded, I ran outside to see what was happening. I saw several American jet planes flying at low altitude from west to east. The leading plane suddenly dove down, and there was a burst of machine gun fire. At this time, the remaining American planes followed suit and strafed, injuring and killing many people."

Among the fifty-two injured and dead, seventeen were children under the age of fifteen. Eleven-year-old Teng Xixiu and his nine-year-old brother Teng Xijing were playing in front of their house and leaned against the wall to take cover when they heard the air raid siren. As they were looking up at the American planes circling and strafing in the air, they were hit by bullets. Teng Xixiu's head was injured, and Teng Xijing's left brain and left leg were seriously injured and died from excessive bleeding. Another twelve-year-old child, Wang Decai, was hit by fragments of an American aircraft's explosive bullet in eleven places on his way home from school. Among the victims were also many housewives. Forty-eight-year-old Wang Shao was cleaning the yard when an American bullet pierced her right collarbone, killing her on the spot. Another woman, Wang Jianzhi, was doing needlework on the kang when she was also injured in the foot by a bullet from an American aircraft.

Currently, the fifty injured individuals have received emergency treatment from the People's Government health authorities, and their conditions have improved. Among them, ten critically injured individuals are out of danger.

The people of Antung City have automatically collected the ironclad evidence of the American aerial bandits' latest bloody crime – unexploded American bullets and shrapnel removed from the wounds – and handed them over to the local People's Government for preservation as evidence.

    美机七月十一日滥行扫射安东市经过
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】本社记者报道七月十一日美国飞机在安东市滥行扫射和杀害我国和平人民的经过称：美机滥行扫射安东市民的血腥事件发生后，记者赶赴出事地点，向受害者家属、受伤者本人和许多目睹美机扫射的市民进行详细调查，证实在七月十一日侵入安东市上空的美机共有两批：第一批美机八架在下午一时五十七分侵入安东市上空；第二批美机四架在下午五时二十三分再度侵入安东市上空。这两批美机都在安东市上空进行野蛮的扫射，结果使该市人口最稠密的区域——七道街、仁忠街、于家街、八道街、聚宝街等地居民共有五十名受伤，两名死亡。
    亲眼看到美机扫射的该市第三区工作人员于吉庆诉述当时情况说：“当空袭警报响起时，我就跑到屋外来看，看到几架美国喷气飞机由西往东低空飞行，最前面那架飞机突然向下俯冲，传来一阵机枪声。这时其余几架美机跟着扫射，打伤打死了许多人。”
    在五十二名伤者和死者中，有十七名是十五岁以下的儿童。十一岁的滕锡秀和他九岁的弟弟滕锡京在家门口玩耍，听到空袭警报响后就靠在墙边躲避。当他们正抬头注视在空中盘旋扫射的美机时，就被射来子弹击中。滕锡秀的头部被打伤，滕锡京的左脑部和左腿受重伤后因流血过多而死亡。另一十二岁的孩子王德财在放学回家途中，被美国飞机的爆炸子弹的碎屑打伤十一处。受害者之中还有许多是家庭妇女。四十八岁的王邵氏正在清扫院子，被一颗美国子弹打穿右锁骨，当场死去。另一名妇女王建志正在炕上做针线活时，也被美国飞机的子弹打伤了脚。
    现在五十名受伤者经过人民政府卫生机关的紧急治疗，伤势都已好转，其中十名重伤者已脱离险期。
    安东市人民已自动将美国空中强盗又一次血腥罪行的铁证——尚未爆炸的美国子弹和从伤口里取出的弹片搜集起来，交给当地人民政府存留作证。
