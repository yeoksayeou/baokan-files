    Children Love the Volunteer Army Uncles
    Shao Rufan
    In our Jingwei Elementary School in Harbin, over 1,200 children are happily learning and living. Among the children’s happy lives, the most delightful thing is often receiving and reading letters from the Volunteer Army soldiers and writing letters to them. Almost every day, children ask, “Teacher, has there been a letter from the Volunteer Army uncles?” The children regard the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as the most respectable heroes, the closest friends, and the best role models. They think of the Volunteer Army uncles every day, looking forward to receiving letters from them and hoping to meet these heroic uncles.
    Once, Gao Binqian, a fifth-grader, received letters from three Volunteer Army soldiers. He excitedly read them over and over, “Little friend, I was very happy to receive your letter… We guarantee to you that we will protect your safe learning with our lives.” The Volunteer Army comrades' strong will and noble spirit of self-sacrifice were such a great encouragement to the children! They remembered it word by word in their hearts, treasured the letters, and talked and reminisced about them for a long time. After receiving a photo from the children, Tang Yu, a Volunteer Army convalescent, wrote a long letter of more than 3,000 words while sick, saying, "We will definitely recuperate well and strive to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible to return to the front line to answer your love for us." In this year, the children received many letters from the front and hospitals, as well as photos and pictures. In every letter, there was a strong confidence in victory and deep concern and affection for the children, which gave the children great encouragement. The children, with excitement, wrote back to them one by one. Nine-year-old Cheng Ping put more than a dozen of his favorite landscape pictures in an envelope and wrote, "Uncles must miss the motherland very much. I will send you these pictures of the motherland." Some also wrote, "Uncle, I must study hard, exercise, and be a good child. When you return victoriously, I will definitely go to the station to meet you!"
    I once saw a second-grade elementary school student writing stroke by stroke: "Dear Uncle, I miss you very much. I am very happy that you won the battle in Korea. I salute you!" When I looked around our spacious and beautiful school building and looked at the children's bright red scarves, I could understand the child's feelings. At the same time, I also thought of our teachers' classroom teaching, how vividly and enthusiastically they told the children about the victory news, battle stories, and heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield; about the joint combat of the Chinese and Korean people during the Anti-Japanese War, and about the story of General Kim Il-sung. This left a very deep impression on the children. The children understood the disasters of the old Chinese people, understood the happiness after liberation, and also understood who was protecting them and who was destroying peace. Therefore, they loved their school and family more, loved their current happy life, and linked this happiness with the heroic name of the Volunteer Army. The children know that only with peace, only by eliminating war, can the happiness of children and the happiness of mankind be guaranteed. Therefore, supporting and comforting the Volunteer Army has become an important part of their lives.
    In winter, when they were all wearing warm cotton clothes, they thought of their uncles who were far away on the Korean battlefield protecting them. So the girls put needles and threads and buttons in the comfort bags. Wu Chunhui and Chen Fengxia, second-graders, told the teacher, "The Volunteer Army uncles are fighting the American devils in the ice and snow. If their clothes are broken or the buttons fall off, no one will sew them. Now we send needles, threads and buttons, so they can sew them themselves."
    On weekdays, the children enthusiastically helped the families of the soldiers; in response to the call to donate planes and artillery, they saved their pocket money little by little and participated in charity book sales. During the hot summer vacation, Ren Jiqing, a fifth-grader, sold more than 150 books by himself. They very much hope that their "Children's" plane can fly up soon, so that the Volunteer Army uncles can drive it to strike the American devils and defend the people of the motherland. They regard it as the greatest honor to be able to do something for the Volunteer Army uncles and for the great struggle against US aggression and aid to Korea.
    Meeting the heroic uncles is the most exciting thing for the children. Last December, the children met five Volunteer Army convalescent comrades who were about to return to the front. The children warmly welcomed them; they cordially comforted them. Wang Linglan, a fourth-grader, wrote about a soldier with a scar on his face in her diary: "The scar on the Volunteer Army uncle's face is not ugly at all. It is a glorious scar, a sign of serving the people..." What pure and beautiful feelings! The children's purity and enthusiasm also gave the Volunteer Army soldiers great emotion and encouragement. Comrade Zhang Yong, who returned to the front, said in a letter to the principal: "The impression the children gave me was so profound. They are so lovely! We are all proud to have such an excellent young generation!"
    In meeting and communicating with the heroic uncles, the children not only deepened their love for the Volunteer Army and encouraged their own learning, but more importantly, they found a role model to learn from the noble qualities and heroic behavior of the Volunteer Army soldiers who love the motherland and the people. The children have established lofty ideals for their future and linked their future with the future of the motherland. A girl said: "I hope to be a writer in the future, writing about workers and peasants, writing about the motherland, and writing about the heroes who defend the motherland..." Some children are determined to exercise well, so that they can become strong soldiers who defend the motherland like the Volunteer Army uncles; and many children hope to be model workers, engineers, or people's teachers, tractor drivers, aviation pilots, horticulturalists, scientists, painters... but all are to serve the motherland. They actively participate in various extracurricular activity groups organized for them, such as: glider groups, geographical travel groups, music, dance, sports, gardening, and communication groups. The children who want to be Michurin-style horticulturists in the future are enthusiastically carrying out experiments on grafting eggplants and tomatoes and other plants on the school campus, diligently turning the soil, sowing seeds, and watering, watching their experimental results with great interest. The students in the glider group are very interested in complex manufacturing, experimenting, researching, and revising again and again. When they see the glider they made with their own hands gradually increasing in height and speed, they clap their hands happily. They cherish their labor results very much, but they choose the best glider to send to the Volunteer Army uncles. The children in the glider group have a special affection for airplanes. Zhang Anshu, a fifth-grader, mentioned in his composition:
    "When I hear the sound of the plane, my heart jumps up. It encourages me to study hard and exercise well..." The children are studying hard with such hope and confidence. When they encounter difficulties on the road to advancement, they use the name of the Volunteer Army and the spirit of the Volunteer Army living in air-raid shelters, eating snowballs, charging, and climbing mountains to encourage themselves. The children yearn for the heroic cause of the Volunteer Army for the motherland and the people, and take them as their direction of advancement. This new generation will always grow stronger under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong, in the free and happy land of the motherland, and become outstanding successors to the cause of defending peace and human liberation!

    孩子们热爱志愿军叔叔
    邵汝范
    在我们哈尔滨市经纬小学校里，有一千二百多个儿童在愉快地学习、生活着。在孩子们的愉快生活中，有一件最愉快的事，就是常常接读志愿军战士们的来信，给志愿军战士们写信。几乎每天都有孩子们在打听：“老师，志愿军叔叔来信了吗？”儿童们把中国人民志愿军看做最值得敬爱的英雄、最亲密的朋友和最好的榜样。他们天天想念着志愿军叔叔们，盼望着叔叔们来信，也盼望着能够会见这些英雄的叔叔。
    有一次，五年级的高彬谦曾收到三位志愿军战士的来信，他兴奋地一遍一遍地读着：“小朋友，来信接到了，我很高兴……我们向你保证，我们要以生命来保护你们安全学习。”志愿军同志们的坚强意志，自我牺牲的高贵品质，给孩子们多么大的鼓舞呀！他们一个字一个字地把它记在心里，又珍惜地把信保存起来，并长久地谈论着、回忆着。一位志愿军休养员唐玉同志在接到孩子寄去的照片后，在病中写了三千多字的一封长信，表示：“我们一定好好休养，争取早日出院，重返前线，来回答你们对我们的热爱。”在这一年中，孩子们收到了许多从前线和医院寄来的信，还有照片、画片等。在每一封来信里，都充溢着战士们坚强的胜利信心和对孩子们的深切关怀与爱抚，给了孩子们极大的鼓励。孩子们怀着激动的心情，又一封封地复信给他们。九岁的程平把十几张心爱的风景画片装在信封里，写道：“叔叔们一定很想念祖国，我把这几张祖国的画片送给你。”也有的写：“叔叔，我一定要好好学习，锻炼身体，做个好孩子。等你胜利回来时，我一定去车站迎接你！”
    我曾经看见一个二年级的小学生，一笔一划地写着：“亲爱的叔叔，我很想念你，你们在朝鲜打了胜仗，我很高兴，我给你行个礼！”当我环顾一下我们宽敞美丽的校舍，看一看孩子们的鲜红领巾，我能够理解这孩子的心情。同时我也想起了我们教师们的课堂教学，他们曾是怎样生动地热情地给孩子们讲述朝鲜战场上的胜利消息、战斗故事和英雄事迹；讲述抗日战争时期中朝人民的并肩作战，讲述金日成将军的故事。这曾给孩子们留下了十分深刻的印象。孩子们懂得了旧中国人民的灾难，懂得了解放后的幸福，也懂得了是谁在保卫着他们，是谁在破坏着和平。因此他们更加热爱他们的学校和家庭，热爱现在的幸福生活，并且把这幸福和志愿军的英雄名字联系起来了。儿童们知道只有和平，只有消灭战争，儿童的幸福和人类的幸福才有保障。因此，支援和慰问志愿军就成了他们生活中重要的事了。
    冬天，当他们都穿上暖和的棉衣的时候，他们就想起了远在朝鲜战场上保卫着自己的叔叔们。于是女孩子们就在慰问袋里装上针线、钮扣。二年级吴春晖，陈凤霞告诉老师说：“志愿军叔叔在冰天雪地里和美国鬼子打仗，衣服破了、扣子掉了没人缝；现在寄去针线钮扣，他们自己就可以缝了。”
    平日里，孩子们热情地帮助军属做事；响应捐献飞机大炮的号召，他们一点点节省零钱，参加义卖图书工作。在炎热的暑假里，五年级任吉庆一个人就卖了一百五十多本书。他们很希望他们的“儿童号”飞机能早日飞起来，让志愿军叔叔去驾驶着，打击美国鬼子，保卫祖国人民。他们以能够为志愿军叔叔、为伟大的抗美援朝斗争做点事情为最大的光荣。
    和英雄的叔叔们会面，是孩子们最兴奋的事。去年十二月间，孩子们曾会见五位即将重返前线的志愿军休养员同志。孩子们热情地迎接他们；亲切地慰问他们。四年级的王铃兰曾在日记中这样描写一位脸上留着疤痕的战士：“志愿军叔叔脸上的疤痕，一点也不难看，这是光荣的疤，是为人民服务的标志……”这是多么纯真而美好的感情啊！孩子们的纯真、热情，也给志愿军战士们以极大的感动和鼓舞。回到前线的张永同志在写给校长的信中说：“孩子们给我的印象是如此深刻，他们太可爱了！我们都为有这样年青的优秀的一代而骄傲！”
    孩子们在和英雄叔叔们会面、通信中，不但加深了对志愿军的热爱，鼓舞了自己的学习，更重要的是从志愿军战士们热爱祖国、热爱人民的高贵品质和英雄行为中找到了自己学习的榜样。孩子们对于自己的未来，树立了远大的理想，并且把自己的前途和祖国的前途联结起来了。一个女孩子说：“我希望将来做个作家，写工农，写祖国，写保卫祖国的英雄。……”有的孩子决心好好运动，为的是将来做一名像志愿军叔叔一样坚强的保卫祖国的战士；还有许多孩子希望做一个模范工人、工程师，或者是一名人民教师、拖拉机手、航空驾驶员、园艺家、科学家、画家……但都是为着给祖国服务。他们积极参加为他们组织的各种课外活动小组，如：滑翔机小组，地理旅行小组，音乐、舞蹈、体育、园艺、通讯小组。想在将来做一个米丘林式的园艺家的孩子们，在学校的校园里热心进行着茄子与西红柿及其他植物接种的试验，辛勤地翻土、播种、浇水，怀着极大的兴趣注视着它们的试验结果。滑翔机小组的学生们十分有兴趣地从事复杂的制作，一次又一次地试验、研究、修改。当他们看到自己亲手制作的滑翔机逐渐地增加高度和速度的时候，就高兴地拍起手来。他们异常珍爱自己的劳动成果，但他们却选择最好的滑翔机送给志愿军叔叔。滑翔机小组的孩子们对飞机发生了一种特殊亲切的感情。五年级的张安树在他的作文中曾提到：
    “当我听到飞机的响声，我的心就跳起来，它鼓舞我好好学习，好好锻炼身体……。”孩子们是这样充满希望与信心地努力学习，他们在前进的道路上遇到困难的时候，便用志愿军的名字和志愿军住防空洞、吃雪团和冲锋、爬山的精神来鼓舞自己。孩子们向往着志愿军为祖国为人民的英雄事业，并把他们做为自己前进的方向。这新生的一代，将永远在毛泽东的光辉照耀下，在祖国自由幸福的土地上更健壮地成长起来，成为保卫和平与人类解放事业的优秀继承者！
