Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 9th: The US side has once again massacred our personnel detained on Geoje Island. According to a United Press report from Geoje Island on the 7th, two of our detained personnel were beaten to death, and another eight were injured.

After committing this bloody crime, the US side once again resorted to their long-bankrupt trick of falsely accusing our detained personnel who were beaten to death and injured of "rioting" and "attempting to escape" in order to cover up their bloody crimes.

However, the US side's criminal acts cannot be concealed after all. The same report also revealed that Bonner, the head of the US prisoner-of-war camp, is continuing to forcibly disperse our personnel detained on Geoje Island on a large scale. The report stated: "Thirty thousand prisoners of war are being transferred from the large Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp to four smaller camps according to Bonner's plan." People know that the real purpose of the US side's forced dispersal of our prisoners of war is to detain a large number of our prisoners of war. According to past announcements by the US side, at least one hundred of our prisoners of war have been beaten to death or injured since the US side began dispersing our prisoners of war on June 10. It is not difficult to imagine that this new bloody incident is the result of the US side continuing this criminal action. The same report also revealed that the US side is continuing to persecute our prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps. The report stated that when prisoners "sing or shout after 8:00 PM," US guards "use tear gas."

The crimes of the executioner Bonner, who uses force to persecute and massacre our prisoners of war, have been protested and condemned by people all over the world. However, an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 6th praised him, saying, "Bonner used a language that his prisoners understood—force."

Simultaneous with the forced dispersal and massacre of our prisoners of war, the US side has continued to openly hand over the second batch of our prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang. Thanks to our significant efforts, the armistice negotiations have now entered administrative meetings to seek a fair resolution on the prisoner-of-war issue that meets the requirements of both sides. However, the US side's continued acts of abusing and massacring our prisoners of war and unilaterally handling prisoners of war cannot help but make people doubt whether the US side is truly sincere in resolving the problem.

### 美方又在巨济岛进行屠杀  并继续强迫分散和片面处理战俘

    美方又在巨济岛进行屠杀
    并继续强迫分散和片面处理战俘
    【新华社开城九日电】美方又一次屠杀被拘留在巨济岛的我方被俘人员。据合众社巨济岛七日电透露，我方被俘人员二名被打死，另八名被打伤。
    美方在制造这一血案后，又采用他们的早已破了产的伎俩，对横遭打死打伤的我方被俘人员加以“暴动”、“逃走”等罪名，以掩饰他们的血腥罪行。
    但是美方的罪恶勾当到底是瞒不住的。该电同时透露：美方战俘营的负责人波纳正在继续大规模地强迫分散被拘留在巨济岛上的我方被俘人员。该电说：“三万战俘正按照波纳的计划从巨济岛大俘虏营迁移到四个较小的营场去”。人们知道：美方强迫分散我方被俘人员的真正目的，在于扣留大批我方被俘人员。据美方过去宣布：从六月十日美方分散我方被俘人员以来，我方被俘人员被打死打伤的至少已有一百多人，不难想像，这一次新的血案正是美方继续这一罪恶行动的结果。该电同时透露：美方正在战俘营中继续残害我方被俘人员。该电说：“当俘虏在下午八点钟以后唱歌或叫喊”时，美方卫兵“就使用催泪性毒气”。
    刽子手波纳凭借武力迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行，已受到全世界人民的抗议和斥责。但美联社六日从华盛顿发出的电讯，竟大加赞扬说：“波纳使用了他的俘虏们所懂得的一种语言——武力。”
    与强迫分散及屠杀我方被俘人员同时，美方又继续把第二批我方被俘人员公开移交给李承晚匪帮。由于我方的重大努力，停战谈判现已进入行政性会议，以寻求在战俘问题上能满足双方要求的公平解决。但美方的这种继续虐杀我方被俘人员和片面处理战俘的行动，使人不得不怀疑美方是否真有解决问题的诚意。
