    Ningxia Lingwu Farm Successfully Adopts "Dry Direct Seeding" Method for Rice

    The state-owned Lingwu Mechanized Farm in Ningxia Province has achieved success this year by adopting the advanced Soviet "dry direct seeding" method for rice planting. This year, the farm used this method to plant 1,710 mu of rice, with an average emergence rate of over 90 percent, and the seedlings are growing very vigorously.

    The "dry direct seeding" method involves preparing the land and then directly sowing the seeds into the ground with machinery, followed by appropriate watering to aid growth. This sowing method not only solves the problem of machines not being able to transplant seedlings but also saves a significant amount of seeds (25 percent less than manual sowing) and achieves high yields.

    Last year, the Lingwu Mechanized Farm also experimented with "dry direct seeding" on 10 mu of newly reclaimed alkaline sandy soil. However, due to seeds being sown too deep, the rice seedlings had difficulty emerging, and the emergence rate was only 65 percent. However, the yield was 7 percent higher than that of local farmers. This year, the farm learned from last year's experience of deep sowing and poor seedling emergence. First, they used a roller to crush and flatten the soil clods in the field, making the soil loose, fine, and uniform. The sowing depth was maintained at 1 to 2 centimeters, which greatly improved the rice seed emergence rate.

    Lingwu Farm is the largest mechanized farm directly under the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. Ningxia Province has 2 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed for rice cultivation. The successful adoption of "dry direct seeding" by Lingwu Farm this time has extremely important demonstration significance for the province's future large-scale use of machinery for rice planting.

### 宁夏灵武农场采用“水稻旱直播”法成功

    宁夏灵武农场采用“水稻旱直播”法成功
    国营宁夏省灵武机耕农场今年采用苏联先进的“水稻旱直播”播种方法获得成功。农场今年用这种方法播种的水稻一千七百一十亩，出苗率平均达到百分之九十以上，禾苗都长得很壮。
    “水稻旱直播”播种法，是将地整好后，用机器直接把种籽撒在地里，然后适当放水，帮助生长。用这种播种法，不仅解决了机器不能插秧的问题，还可节省许多种籽（较人工播种节省百分之二十五）和获得高额产量。
    灵武机耕农场去年也曾在新垦碱性沙质土壤上用“旱直播”法试种了十亩水稻。但因下籽太深，稻苗出土困难，出苗率仅为百分之六十五，但产量却比当地农民高百分之七。今年该场接受了去年深播缺苗的教训，首先用镇压器将田内的土块压碎碾平，使土壤松细均匀，播种深度保持一公分至二公分，因此稻种出苗率大大提高。
    灵武农场，是西北军政委员会农林部直属农场中最大的机耕农场。宁夏省现有可开垦为种植水稻的荒地达二百万亩。灵武农场这次采用“旱直播”的成功，对于该省今后大规模利用机械种植水稻有极重要的示范作用。    （新华社）
