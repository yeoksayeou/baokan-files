Korean Children
    —A Record of Life in Korean Orphanages
    Xu Kong
    Children in our country who live in a peaceful environment and their parents must often think about Korean children, especially those Korean children who have lost their parents in the war. I would like to tell all those who care about Korean children what I have seen in Korea.
    The inhuman atrocities of American imperialism in Korea have brought immeasurable suffering to Korean children. The state-run orphanage in Jiangyuan Province alone has taken in more than six thousand orphans in the past year. Some of these children were carried from south of the 38th parallel by soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers; some had parents killed by the enemy and escaped to find the orphanage; and many children were only three or four years old, unaware of their parents' names or their own age, wrapped in blankets and sent from village to village to the orphanage. Every child has a history of suffering. A girl named Liu Changlian, who is twelve years old this year, lived a peaceful and happy life like the children of our country before the war. Her father cultivated 2,400 pings of rice paddies distributed after the land reform, and she went to school with her younger brother every day to study singing and dancing. But in June 1950, American imperialism ignited the flames of a war of aggression, her father joined the army to the front line to defend the country, and her school was bombed by enemy planes. On a snowy night, she heard the sound of airplane engines in her dream. She instinctively climbed into her mother's arms. When she opened her eyes, the light of the incendiary bombs had already turned the window paper red. A bomb exploded in front of the house. Her mother, to protect her three children, clung tightly to them and was killed instantly. She and her two younger brothers also fell unconscious from serious injuries. After the enemy planes left, neighbors rushed into the burning, collapsed house and rescued the three orphans who had lost their mother. ... Another child from the vicinity of Jin Cheng, understood nothing, except that as soon as he arrived, he sang several Chinese songs, and before each song, he gestured with his little hands and shouted in Chinese: "Ready, sing!" The orphanage’s nanny surmised that this child must have been raised by the Chinese People's Volunteers for a long time after losing his parents before being transferred here. ...
    The bloody atrocities of American imperialism are endless. But these children, like their heroic parents, cannot be subdued by the enemy's bloody atrocities. They are waging a tenacious struggle. In the orphanage in Sinuiju, there is a boy named Jin Zairong, whose home is in Seoul. His father sacrificed himself in the mountains fighting guerrillas after the American imperialists launched the war of aggression in 1950. When the enemy retreated from Seoul, they forced them to retreat south. That night, he and his mother took his younger brother and escaped the enemy's blockade, heading north. Enemy planes chased these women and children and carried out a frenzied strafing. His mother died under a large mountain. Before her death, his mother pulled him close, and with a weak voice, said to him: "Don't stay here, go north, there is your beloved father - General Kim Il-sung!" After everyone helped bury his mother's body, this fourteen-year-old child wiped away his tears, carried his four-year-old brother on his back, and followed his mother's last words, heading north. His shoes were worn out, so he walked barefoot. His feet were bleeding, so he pulled his younger brother and crawled forward inch by inch. After more than two months, he finally arrived in Pyongyang. Now this child gets up early every day to practice on the horizontal bar. He is determined to become an excellent artilleryman and avenge his parents! Every child here has the same strong fighting will and lofty ideals. Some strive to study mathematics, preparing to become outstanding technicians or engineers of the motherland in the future; the girl, Park Songzi, enthusiastically studies dance, saying: "I must become a Korean people's dancer in the future and go to China and the Soviet Union!"
    In the difficult war environment, the Korean People's Government still uses great efforts to educate these children, so that each of them can develop their talents and become outstanding cadres of the motherland in the future. We once visited the orphanage in Huaiyang County. There are one hundred and five children here, of whom sixty-five older children over the age of eight are studying in nearby state schools. After graduating from middle school, they can enter universities or technical colleges free of charge. Those children under the age of eight are taken by the nannies to play in the mountains and forests every day, taught the names and uses of various plants and trees, and shown pictures of leaders of people from various countries, explaining the deeds of the leaders of people from various countries, cultivating children's sound will to live. From their painful experiences, the children deeply realize how they should love the motherland and how they should repay the government and the people for their painstaking efforts in nurturing them. They all work very hard in their studies. Among the twenty-seven students above the third grade in this orphanage, nine are the best students, and eight are excellent students. All students above the third grade have joined the Young Pioneers. These Young Pioneers members led all the children in the orphanage to establish strict living rules: no fighting, no crying, going to school together every morning, and those with good grades helping those with poor grades to review their lessons. ... After school, the older children organized themselves to help the nannies clean the courtyard, some helped cook in the kitchen, and some went to the mountains to collect firewood. They also built their own Young Pioneers branch headquarters in the pine forest on the hillside, where they met every Saturday to review the week's life and study. These children not only study hard and abide by the rules of the orphanage, but also assist the local government in actively participating in social activities. In the spring, after the government called for an increase in production, the children in the orphanage formed an encouragement team, going to nearby villages every night to sing and dance for the farmers, mobilizing them to work hard to produce and support the front lines. Every morning before dawn, the children of the encouragement team got up, lined up and walked through the villages while singing, and some children stood on the mountainsides at the edge of the villages shouting slogans like "Do not leave an inch of land uncultivated." The nearby farmers were all moved by the actions of these children, and got up every morning as soon as they heard the children's singing and went to the fields. The women picked them up and said kindly: "Good children, hurry up and go to school, we must produce more grain to support the front. You must also study hard and live up to the hopes of the motherland!"
    Now, these outstanding children are not only loved and cared for by the Korean people and government, but also cared for by the people of all countries in the world. The boys' clothes in this orphanage were sent from China, and the girls' clothes were sent from the Soviet Union and Hungary. Their school supplies were also donated by various People's Democratic countries. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers often took out their surplus living expenses to buy towels, soap and other daily necessities for the children. Last spring, seventy-seven children in Jiangyuan Province were taken to Poland and Hungary for fostering. The nannies of the orphanage used these concrete facts to educate the children on internationalism. Now every young child in the orphanage knows the names of Chairman Mao and Stalin. We took a picture of Chairman Mao and asked a five-year-old child, Yin Jixiang, "Who is this?" He replied: "Mao Zedong." We asked again: "Who is Mao Zedong?" He replied without hesitation: "Is Dad!" We were deeply moved by this naive answer. Every person living in a peaceful and happy environment, especially every father and mother, when you see your own children's happy lives and feel happy, please remember that our dear comrades-in-arms - the Korean people are making arduous struggles to defend the peaceful and happy lives of children all over the world. Support the Korean people more actively! Support the children of the Korean people! Let them be able to live healthier, happier, and more happily!

    朝鲜的孩子们
    ——记朝鲜爱育院儿童的生活
    徐孔
    生活在和平环境中的我国儿童和他们的父母一定也会时常想到朝鲜儿童，特别是那些在战争中失掉了父母的朝鲜儿童是怎样生活的吧！我愿意把我在朝鲜所看到的告诉所有关心朝鲜儿童的人们。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜的惨无人道的暴行，给朝鲜的孩子们带来无比深重的灾难。仅江原道的国家爱育院在过去一年多就收容了六千多个孤儿。这些孩子有的是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士们从三八线以南背来的；有的是他们的父母被敌人杀死，自己逃出来找到爱育院的；还有很多孩子只有三四岁，他们还不知道父母的姓名和自己的年龄，是人们用被子把他们裹着、从一个村到一个村辗转送到爱育院来的。每个孩子都有一段苦难的经历。有个叫刘常莲的女孩子，今年十二岁，在战争以前，她和我们祖国的孩子们一样过着和平幸福的生活，爸爸耕种着土地改革后分到的两千四百坪稻田，她每天和弟弟一起到学校里念书，学习唱歌和舞蹈。可是一九五○年六月美帝国主义燃起了侵略战争的烽火，她的爸爸为了保卫祖国参军到前线去了，她的学校被敌人飞机炸毁了。在一个大雪纷飞的夜里，她在梦里听到飞机的马达声。她本能地爬进了妈妈的怀里。等她睁开眼睛时，烧夷弹的火光已经映得窗纸通红。一颗炸弹在屋前爆炸。妈妈为了掩护三个孩子，紧紧爬在她们身上，当时就被炸死。她和两个弟弟也因为受重伤昏了过去。敌机走后，邻近的人们冲进这个烧着大火、倾塌了的房子，救出这三个失掉了妈妈的孤儿。……另一个来自金城附近的孩子，还什么事都不懂，只是他一来就会唱好几个中国歌，而且每次唱歌以前，两个小手比划着，用中国话喊：“预备，唱！”爱育院的褓姆推断这个孩子一定是失掉父母后被中国人民志愿军抚养很久才转到这里来的。……
    美帝国主义的血腥暴行是说不完的。可是这些儿童像他们的英雄的父母一样，敌人的血腥暴行并不能使他们屈服。他们进行着顽强的斗争。在新义州的爱育院里有个叫金再荣的男孩子，家在汉城，父亲在一九五○年美国帝国主义发动侵略战争后到山上打游击牺牲了。敌人从汉城败退时，强迫他们向南撤退。那天夜里他和妈妈带着弟弟逃出敌人的封锁往北走。敌人的飞机追赶这些妇女和儿童并施行疯狂的扫射。妈妈在一个大山下遇难。妈妈临死前拉着他，用微弱的声音对他说：“不要留在这儿，往北走，那里有你亲爱的父亲——金日成将军！”这个十四岁的孩子在大家帮着埋了妈妈的尸体之后，擦干眼泪，背起四岁的弟弟按着妈妈的遗言，向北方进发。鞋子走坏了，他光着脚走。脚磨出了血，就拉着弟弟一尺一尺地往前爬。经过两个多月，他终于到了平壤。现在这个孩子每天早起练单杠，他立志要作个优秀的炮兵，给爸爸妈妈报仇！这里的孩子们每个人都具有同样的坚强的斗争意志，并有着远大的理想。他们有的努力钻研数学，准备将来成为祖国杰出的技术兵或工程师；女孩子朴松子则热心地学习舞蹈，她说：“我将来一定要作个朝鲜人民舞蹈家，到中国和苏联去！”
    在艰苦的战争环境里，朝鲜人民政府仍然用极大的力量来教养这些儿童，使他们每个人都能发挥自己的才智，将来成为祖国的优秀干部。我们曾经到过淮阳郡的爱育院。这里有一百零五个孩子，其中六十五个八岁以上的大孩子都在附近的国家学校里读书，中学毕业以后，他们可以免费升入大学或技术专科学校。那些八岁以下的孩子，每天由褓姆带着到山上林间作游戏，教给她们各种草木的名字和用途，拿着各国人民领袖的像片，讲解各国人民领袖的事迹，培养孩子们健全的生活意志。孩子们从他们的痛苦的经历里深刻体会到应该怎样热爱祖国，怎样报答政府和人民培养他们的苦心。他们在学习上都非常努力。这个爱育院中二十七个三年级以上的学生，就有九个是最优等生，八个是优等生。三年级以上的学生全都参加了少年团。这些少年团的团员们带动全院的孩子订立了严格的生活公约：不打架、不哭，每天早晨一块上学，成绩好的帮助成绩差的复习功课。……大的孩子放学后，有组织地协助褓姆打扫庭院，有的到伙房帮助作饭，有的到山上打柴。他们还在山坡的松林里建设了自己少年团分团的团部，每星期六在那里开会，检查一周的生活和学习。这些儿童不仅努力学习、遵守院规，而且还协助当地政府积极参加社会活动。春天，政府号召开展增产运动后，院里的儿童们便组成了鼓励队，每天晚上到附近村庄里给农民唱歌跳舞，动员他们努力生产支援前线。每天早晨天还没亮，鼓励队的儿童们就起来了，排成队在村庄里一边走
    一边唱歌，有的孩子站到村边山头上喊着“不荒一寸土地”的口号。附近的农民都为这些儿童的行动所感动，每天早上一听到儿童们的歌声马上就起来下地。妇女们抱起他们亲切地说：“好孩子，你们赶快上学去吧，我们一定要多打粮食支援前方。你们也一定好好学习，不辜负祖国的希望！”
    现在，这些优秀的儿童们，不仅得到朝鲜人民和政府的爱护和照顾，而且也为世界各国人民所关怀。这个爱育院里男孩子的衣服是从中国送来的，女孩子的衣服是从苏联和匈牙利送来的。她们的学习用品也都是各人民民主国家捐赠的。中国人民志愿军的战士们还常常拿出节余的生活费给孩子们买毛巾、肥皂等日用品。去年春天江原道有七十七个孩子被波兰和匈牙利接去抚养。爱育院的褓姆们就用这些具体的事实对儿童进行了国际主义的教育。现在爱育院里每一个年幼的孩子都知道毛主席和斯大林的名字。我们曾拿着毛主席的像片问一个五岁的孩子尹基祥说：“这是谁？”他答道：“毛泽东。”我们又问：“毛泽东是谁？”他不加思索地答道：“是爸爸！”这天真的答话我们深受感动。每一个生活在和平幸福环境里的人们，特别是每一个父亲和母亲，当你们看到自己孩子的幸福生活而感到快乐的时候，请记住，我们亲爱的战友——朝鲜人民正在为保卫全世界孩子的和平幸福生活作着艰苦的斗争。更积极的支援朝鲜人民吧！支援朝鲜人民的孩子们吧！让他们能够生活得更健康、更快活、更幸福！
