To the Editor: This year, the armyworm infestation in the fields is more severe than in the past two years. If there is sufficient rainfall before the beginning of autumn, it will be even more conducive to the development and growth of armyworms. After these worms mature, they can devour millet in a very short time. We should not neglect this pest just because it has not caused widespread damage in the past two years and because the millet is currently growing well. We must raise high vigilance and do a good job in prevention and control work:

	I. Mid-to-late July is when armyworm eggs hatch in the millet fields. They attach to the middle and upper parts of the millet leaves, near the leaf tips. The leaves with eggs fold up and turn grayish-yellow. During this period, check the millet fields carefully every three to five days and collect and burn the leaves with eggs.

	II. August is the period when armyworms are most damaging to millet. Check the millet fields frequently. If armyworms are found, use the armyworm scoops and armyworm carts created by the masses to catch them. Not only should treatment be early, but also universal, continuous, and thorough.

	III. According to the experience of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, scattering 1% DDT powder or 666 powder containing 0.5% active ingredient, or spraying 0.3% to 0.5% wettable DDT solution (use 0.3% dilution when the worms are small) at dusk or dawn is very effective (DDT or 666 used as powder should not be mixed with water, and wettable DDT should not be used as powder).

	IV. Prevent armyworms from migrating and causing damage (armyworms migrate when the millet is eaten up or about to be eaten up). Dig ditches two feet deep and wide around the millet fields that have not been damaged or have been slightly damaged. The ditch walls should be smooth, and small pits should be dug inside the ditch to make it difficult for armyworms to climb up. Inspect and kill them at any time.

### 严防黏虫为害，保证谷子丰收

    严防黏虫为害，保证谷子丰收
    编辑同志：今年田间发生的黏虫，比去年前年都多。如立秋前雨水充足，就更有利于黏虫的发育生长。这种虫长成后，能在很短时间内把谷子吃光。我们不要以为近两年来这种虫没有普遍为害，目前谷子也长得很好，而忽视这种虫害。我们必须提起高度警惕，做好防治工作：
    一、七月中、下旬是黏虫卵在谷田里孵化的时候，它附黏在谷子中上部的叶子的近叶尖部分。带卵的谷叶摺合起来，变成灰黄色。在这一时期，每隔三五天应到谷田里去仔细检查，把带卵的谷叶采下烧毁。
    二、八月是黏虫为害谷子最厉害的时期，要常到谷田里去检查；发现黏虫，就用群众自己创造的黏虫兜、黏虫车去捕捉。不单要早治，还要普遍治、连续治、彻底治。
    三、根据华北农业科学研究所的经验，在黄昏或天刚亮时撒布百分之一的滴滴涕粉或含千分之五有效成分的六六六粉，或喷射千分之三到千分之五的可湿性滴滴涕液（虫体小时用千分之三的稀释液），都很有效（粉用的滴滴涕或六六六，不可和水使用，可湿性滴滴涕不要当作粉末撒用）。
    四、防止黏虫迁移为害（黏虫把谷子吃光或将吃光时就迁移），在没有被害或被害很少的谷田四周，挖深、阔各二尺的沟，沟壁要光滑，沟内加挖小坑，使黏虫不易爬上来，并随时检查杀死它。
