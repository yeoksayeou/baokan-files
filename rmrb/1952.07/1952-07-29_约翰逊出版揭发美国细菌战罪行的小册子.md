Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: Canterbury Dean Johnson recently published a pamphlet entitled "My Appeal." In this pamphlet, the facts he revealed to the British people once again confirmed the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China.

In the first part of the pamphlet, the author explains in detail the reasons why he believes that the United States is conducting germ warfare, due to the following reasons: First, the strong evidence presented by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team led by Dr. Brandweiner, an Austrian professor of international law and Roman Catholic law. Johnson met this professor when he was abroad. These investigation team representatives repeatedly interviewed witnesses of germ warfare on the spot. Second, the scientific exhibitions held in Beijing and Shenyang. These exhibitions displayed everything related to the subject, including the affected locations, the nature of the attacks, the tools used, the insects and other things dropped, photos of witnesses and affected locations, and methods to deal with the insects. Third, conversations with famous bacteriologists, scientists, and physicians from the Eastern world. Many of them studied in the West and enjoy worldwide fame. Fourth, Johnson's own on-the-spot investigation in three of the seventy affected locations in Northeast China, including Shenyang and Fushun. He personally examined the bacteria-carrying insects captured locally and placed in test tubes, and spoke with several church witnesses. The report by Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett, who served as a Central European reporter for the "Daily Express," also confirmed the U.S. planes dropping germ bombs.

Johnson wrote: The most impressive and undeniable evidence is the evidence provided by two shot-down American pilots. I have seen their long confessions written in their own hands and heard the recordings of their confessions. Burchett, who recently saw them in a prisoner-of-war camp, confirmed that these letters and records are completely authentic. He also said that Quinn, a devout Catholic, told him that his conscience had been troubled by what he had been ordered to do, and he was very glad he had the opportunity to confess.

Johnson mentioned that he had planned to meet with the leaders of all churches – including the Catholic Church – in Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Shanghai, and Shenyang, who unanimously and repeatedly told him about the terrible facts of germ warfare. Johnson said: The statements and declarations of Chinese church leaders "are the voices of millions of Chinese Christians." Johnson wrote: "This is a spontaneous voice. This is an enthusiastic voice. People can no longer dismiss these words about germ warfare merely as Moscow Communist propaganda. Can we, dare we, doubt the sincerity of our Eastern co-religionists? The vast number of believers in the East are eagerly awaiting the response of their Western co-religionists."

Johnson explained that he, as a Christian, hates the use of bacteriological weapons. He said: "I appeal to God. I appeal to the Archbishop of Canterbury. I appeal to the conscience of the British people and the Church, not to ignore this appeal for help, not to deliberately treat this appeal with skepticism or diplomatic language. I ask all Christian leaders not to create a rift between us and our Eastern co-religionists. …I appeal to the goodness, integrity, and courage of all British people, asking them to insist on never participating in this crime of collective massacre, never participating in this crime of germ warfare."

At the end of the pamphlet, Johnson exposed the reactionary nature of the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross.

The British-China Friendship Association, which published this pamphlet, said that the demand for the pamphlet is very high. A total of 40,000 copies were printed, and 33,000 copies were sold to groups and individuals in two days. Many more purchase requests continue to arrive.

    约翰逊出版揭发美国细菌战罪行的小册子
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：坎特伯雷教长约翰逊最近出版一本小册子，书名“我的呼吁”。他在这本小册子中向英国人民揭发的事实再一次证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的罪行。
    作者在小册子的第一部分中详细说明他之所以相信美国进行细菌战，是由于下述许多原因：第一，奥地利国际法与罗马教法教授、天主教徒布兰德魏纳博士所率领的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团提出的有力证据。约翰逊在国外时曾经遇见这位教授。这些调查团代表曾经实地反复询问了细菌战的目击者。第二，北京与沈阳举行的科学性展览会。其中展览着一切有关的东西——包括受害地点，袭击的性质，使用的工具，投下的昆虫和其他东西，目击者和受害地点的照片，对付昆虫的方法等。第三，与东方世界的著名细菌学家、科学家、医学家的谈话。他们有许多人都是在西方留过学的，享有世界盛名。第四，约翰逊本人亲身在中国东北七十个受害地点中三个地点包括沈阳、抚顺的实地调查。他曾亲自察看在当地捕获后装在试管中的带菌昆虫，并和若干教会中的目击证人说过话。曾担任“每日快报”中欧记者的澳大利亚记者贝却敌的报告也证实了美机投掷细菌弹。
    约翰逊写道：给人印象最深并且是确凿无疑的，是两名被击落的美国飞行员提出的证据。我看过他们亲笔写的长篇供词，听过他们的供词的录音片。前不久在战俘营中见过他们的贝却敌证实这些信件和纪录是完全真实的，他并说，虔诚的天主教徒奎恩曾对他说，想到他奉令所干的事情，他的良心一直受到责备，他十分高兴他有机会坦白出来。
    约翰逊谈到他在北京、汉口、长沙、广州、杭州、蚌埠、上海、沈阳等地曾有计划地会晤所有教会——其中包括天主教教会——的领袖们，他们异口同声地一再告诉他关于细菌战的可怕事实。约翰逊说：中国教会领袖的声明和宣言“是数百万中国教徒的声音”。约翰逊写道：“这是自发的声音。这是热情的声音。人们再也不能把这些关于细菌战的话仅仅当作莫斯科共产党的宣传而置之不理。我们能够、我们胆敢怀疑我们的东方教友的诚实吗？东方的广大的教徒们都热切地等待着他们的西方教友的响应。”
    约翰逊说明他以基督教徒的身份痛恨使用细菌武器。他说：“我向上帝呼吁。我向坎特伯雷大主教呼吁。我向英国人民和教会的良心呼吁，不要不理会这个求援的呼声，不要故意用怀疑态度或用外交辞令来对待这个呼声。我要求所有的基督教领袖们不要在我们和我们的东方教友间造成隔阂。……我向全体英国人民的善良、正直和勇敢呼吁，请他们坚持决不参与这种集体屠杀的罪行、决不参与这种细菌战的罪行。”
    在小册子的最后，约翰逊揭露了所谓红十字国际委员会的反动面目。
    发行这本小册子的英中友好协会说，小册子的需求很大。总共印出了四万册，在两天内卖给团体和个人的就有三万三千册。还有许多购买申请书不断地来到。
