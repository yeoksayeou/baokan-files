    National Democratic Parties and Non-Party Democrats
    Congratulate Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 1st] National democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals wrote to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1st, congratulating them on the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao: Comrades of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
    On the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, we unanimously express our heartfelt congratulations on this glorious and great day.
    Last year today, the entire Chinese people celebrated the great victory achieved under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for 30 years. In the past year, under the leadership of you and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved many new victories on various fronts, advancing the wheel of Chinese history a big step forward. In terms of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, after the U.S. imperialism was forced to accept the armistice negotiations, it still used despicable and shameless means, such as slaughtering prisoners of war and conducting germ warfare, in an attempt to obstruct and disrupt the armistice negotiations; but whether in the conference hall or on the battlefield, we have given the enemy fatal blows and achieved brilliant victories. In terms of land reform, land reform in various regions across the country, except for minority areas, is about to be basically completed. The vast number of landless or land-poor peasants have been distributed land and are actively engaged in production. In terms of finance and economy, agricultural and industrial production has largely approached or even exceeded the highest levels in our history; finance is more stable, and prices are gradually decreasing; the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway were completed ahead of schedule; the great water conservancy projects of the Huai River and the Jingjiang River flood diversion were constructed, and many labor models emerged in various economic sectors and other construction aspects; in the past six months, through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the "Three Evils" and "Five Poisons" left over from the old society have been cleansed, and universal and in-depth social reforms have been carried out, preparing the necessary conditions for the upcoming national construction cause. Countless facts have clearly proved that the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Chairman Mao, is the most trustworthy leader of the Chinese people. Following Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party forever means eternal victory.
    Now we are continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in all aspects, launching a patriotic production increase and economy campaign in various regions, and launching a nationwide ideological remolding movement—studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Currently, we are carrying out the study of the Common Program to further consolidate the people's democratic united front and the people's democratic dictatorship. We are willing to make a guarantee on this glorious day of "July 1st" with full confidence that under the leadership of you and the Chinese Communist Party, and united with the people of the whole country, we will strive to victoriously complete the above-mentioned new and major tasks.

    Dalai Lama's Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
    Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the forces of imperialist aggression have been driven out, and the people of all ethnic groups in China have now been completely liberated. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, great achievements have been made in construction in all aspects. Since the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Tibet has been peacefully liberated. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will make the greatest efforts for the construction of the motherland and Tibet. On the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, I hereby send a telegram to congratulate you.

    Panchen Erdeni's Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
    The Chinese Communist Party, headed by you, has served the people wholeheartedly for 31 years, and has led the people of all ethnic groups across the country with an indomitable, arduous and extraordinary resolute determination and heroic and correct policy guidance, achieving unprecedented great victories, liberating the people of the whole country, and peacefully resolving the Tibetan issue last May, rescuing the Tibetan people from the abyss of disaster. Now the country has begun large-scale construction of various kinds and has achieved astonishing and remarkable results.
    On the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Panchen respectfully leads all the political, religious, monastic and secular officials and people of Tashilhunpo in the Later Tibet, and respectfully sends a telegram to congratulate you, and wholeheartedly supports your correct leadership and the Central Committee, and celebrates this great festival with practical actions to thoroughly implement the peace agreement.

    Korean Workers' Party Sends Congratulatory Telegram
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 30th] The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on June 29th, congratulating them on the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram stated: "On the occasion of the glorious 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, on behalf of all party members and the entire Korean people, extends warm congratulations to your party, all party members, and the fraternal Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, wiped out the domestic reactionary forces and imperialist aggressors, and organized and encouraged the Chinese people to embark on the road of building a people's China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have made tremendous contributions not only in the cause of building a people's China but also in consolidating the peace-loving and anti-imperialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. The just struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the American aggressors—has further consolidated the comradely solidarity between your party and our party and the fraternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party extends its heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and their leaders—the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong—who support the just struggle of the Korean people, and wishes your party even greater achievements in the great cause of the unlimited prosperity of the people's China in the future."
    Vietnamese Workers' Party Sends Congratulatory Telegram
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 30th] Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulating them on the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The congratulatory telegram stated: "On this 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, we, on behalf of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, the Vietnamese working class, and the entire people, respectfully extend warm congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    The congratulatory telegram continued: "Because of the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people's struggle won a great victory, enabling the new China to become an invincible fortress of the world's peace and democracy camp along with the great Soviet Union. The Vietnamese people and the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries, especially the people of Asia, have obtained sharp weapons from the treasure house of Marxism-Engels-Lenin-Stalin theory and Mao Zedong Thought to strive for freedom and independence."
    The congratulatory telegram concluded: "We are determined to strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, lead the Vietnamese people to resist the war, eliminate the French colonialist aggressors and defeat the American imperialist interventionists, so as to strive for national independence, unity, and defend world peace."

    全国各民主党派及无党派民主人士
    向毛主席和中共中央委员会祝贺
    【新华社一日讯】全国各民主党派及无党派民主人士在七月一日写信给毛主席和中国共产党中央委员会，祝贺中国共产党成立三十一周年。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：中国共产党中央委员会诸同志：
    欣逢中国共产党成立三十一周年纪念日，我们一致为这个光荣伟大的日子表示衷心的祝贺。
    去年今日，全中国人民为了三十年来在中国共产党正确领导下获得了伟大胜利而庆祝欢呼，这一年来中国人民在您和中国共产党的领导下，又在各个战线上获得了许多新的胜利，使中国的历史的车轮又前进了一大步。在抗美援朝方面，美帝国主义被迫接受停战谈判之后，还是用卑鄙无耻的手段，例如屠杀战俘、进行细菌战等，妄图阻挠和破坏停战谈判；但无论在会场中或战场上，我们都给敌人以致命的打击，取得了辉煌的胜利。在土地改革方面，除少数民族地区外，全国各地区土地改革即将基本完成，广大的无地或少地的农民分得了土地，积极地进行生产。在财政经济方面，农业和工业生产大部分已接近甚至超过我国历史上最高的水平；金融更加稳定，物价逐渐降低；提前完成成渝铁路和天兰铁路；兴修了淮河和荆江分洪的伟大水利工程，并在各经济部门及其他建设方面涌现出许多劳动模范人物；这半年来通过了“三反”、“五反”的斗争，清洗了旧社会遗留下来的“三害”和“五毒”，进行了普遍而深入的社会改造，为即将到来的国家建设事业，准备了必要的胜利条件。无数的事实都确切地证明了以毛主席为首的中国共产党，是中国人民最可信赖的领导者，永远跟着毛主席和中国共产党走，就是永远的胜利。
    现在我们正在从各方面继续加强抗美援朝运动，正在各地展开爱国增产节约运动，正在展开全国范围的思想改造运动——学习马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想。目前正在进行共同纲领的学习，以进一步巩固人民民主统一战线和人民民主专政。我们愿以满怀的信心，在“七一”这一个光荣的日子提出保证，在您和中国共产党领导之下，和全国人民团结在一起，为了胜利完成以上各种新的重大任务而奋斗。
