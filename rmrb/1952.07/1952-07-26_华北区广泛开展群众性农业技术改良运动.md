    Mass Agricultural Technology Improvement Movement Widely Launched in North China
    In this year's patriotic production increase competition, North China farmers have launched a mass agricultural technology improvement movement, which will play a significant role in increasing the unit area yield of farmland in North China.
    Agricultural technology improvement work in North China already had a considerable mass base in the past. This year, various regions in North China have reorganized and developed the original village technical committees and other mass technical organizations, and established some more formal technical promotion organizations such as joint-village promotion networks and technical instruction stations. This year, the number of technicians trained by the people's governments at all levels in North China and the number of agricultural machinery and implements supplied to farmers are also much higher than in previous years. In the past six months, a total of more than 66,000 new-style agricultural tools and machinery and more than 600 million jin of refined fertilizer have been promoted throughout the region. Many advanced agricultural production experiences and many scientific knowledge in farming, such as improved varieties of various crops and seed selection techniques, and scientific seed treatment work for crop sowing—warm water soaking and dressing seeds with chemicals—are now widely promoted in rural areas of North China. This year, the percentage of farmers implementing seed soaking in some areas of Shanxi Province has reached 100%, and in Chahar Province it has reached 80%. Whether organized or not, farmers in North China are very enthusiastic about improving technology. Learning technology and finding tricks like workers has become one of the main contents of their production activities.
    This year, many joint-village technical promotion organizations have been established in various parts of North China, which has gradually turned technical improvement from the narrow scope of "key experiments" or only staying in a small number of mutual aid teams and typical households into a mass movement with planning, leadership, and the participation of the vast number of farmers. The joint-village technical promotion network is a central organization established on the basis of the universal development of village technology, jointly composed of several village technical team leaders and labor models, and under the guidance of state-owned farms, they regularly gather to exchange and promote technical experience. The names of this type of organization vary, some are called technical promotion stations, some are called technical instruction stations, central technical stations, or joint-village technical research committees. According to statistics, Shanxi Province has 7,123 village technical committees and 245 technical instruction stations. In rural areas of Hebei Province, there is an average of one technical team for every five villages, and many joint-village technical promotion networks have also been established.
    The leading role of state-owned farms in the technical improvement movement is becoming increasingly significant. Last year, 61 farms in Shanxi Province led more than 6,000 village technical committees and trained more than 30,000 labor models and technical experts. This year, they are leading more village technical organizations and have established many rural technical promotion networks in various places. This year, Yangqu Farm and Lishi Farm and other five model county farms have trained many village cadres and active farmers, and relied on these people to establish more than 400 village technical committees and 76 small farms. Xin County Farm in Pingyuan Province regularly maintains contact with 22 technical networks, 19 small farms, and 310 specially contracted farmers in 119 villages, and sends technicians on a regular basis to conduct technical guidance for them. This spring, the farm promoted the grain selection technology and the double-tine plow ditching and planting method of cotton cultivation to these organizations. Farms in various places conduct regular guidance according to the seasons, so that technical improvement work continues to improve.
    The planned promotion of advanced agricultural production experience is a prominent feature of this year's agricultural technology improvement. This year, when promoting advanced agricultural experience in North China, in addition to using technical organizations such as technical training classes, technical instruction stations, and technical promotion networks, farmers were also mobilized to visit the farms of labor models, and the labor models personally explained their experiences. In Qu Yaoli's hometown of Jie County, Shanxi Province, all 115,000 mu of cotton fields in the county this year were planted according to Qu Yaoli's method of planting with full seedlings, uniform spacing, and close planting, and the number of seedlings retained per mu increased from an average of more than 2,000 to about 3,000. The amount of fertilizer application and tillage has also increased, and the cotton fields using refined fertilizer in the county have increased tenfold compared with last year. Chengjiao Village in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, a model village for high cotton yield, promoted the close planting method of cotton under the leadership of labor model Liang Jiarui this spring, so that most of the cotton fields in the village had 800 to 900 more plants per mu than last year. The village's technical organization studies cotton planting technology every half month and promotes advanced experience in thinning seedlings, pest control, fertilization, and cotton field management according to the seasons.
    In the agricultural technology improvement movement, a large number of farmers in North China have received training in scientific knowledge and technology this year. They are labor models, mutual aid team leaders, and village cadres, and have become a bridge to further improve and promote technology. This year, Xingtai County, Hebei Province, had more than 11,400 labor models and mutual aid team leaders who learned techniques such as cotton seedling setting, seedling preservation, topdressing, and aphid control. Hebei Province launched a technical instruction month campaign in June. In June, the People's Government of Hebei Province sent 2,000 agricultural science and technology personnel, carrying a large number of sprayers, pesticides, and disease and pest charts, to go deep into rural areas to widely impart technology to farmers and train cadres in the form of seminars, exhibitions, and exercises, setting off a climax for farmers in the province to learn technology. In one month, they established 3,000 technical instruction stations throughout the province, and at least 3 to 5 million people received their training. Shanxi Province advocates that every rural work cadre should learn technology, and they bring technology to the countryside while working there.

    华北区广泛开展群众性农业技术改良运动
    在今年的爱国增产竞赛运动中，华北农民开展了群众性的农业技术改良运动，这对于提高华北农田的单位面积产量，将起重大作用。
    华北的农业技术改良工作，过去就已经有了相当的群众基础。今年华北各地就原有的村技术委员会等群众性技术组织，加以整理和发展，成立了一些联村推广网和技术传授站等较正规的技术推广组织。今年华北各地人民政府训练的技术人员和供应农民的农业药械，也比往年多得多。半年来，全区推广的各种新式农具和农械共六万六千多部，各种细肥共六亿多斤。许多农业生产先进经验和农事耕作上的许多科学知识，如各种作物的优良品种和选种技术，作物播种的科学的种子处理工作——温汤浸种和药剂拌种，现在在华北农村中已经推广得很普遍了。今年山西省部分地区农户实行浸种的已达百分之百，察哈尔省也达百分之八十。华北的农民，无论组织起来的或没有组织起来的，对改进技术的热情都很高。像工人一样学技术、找窍门，已成为他们的生产活动的主要内容之一。
    今年华北各地建立了许多联村技术推广组织，这使技术改良从过去“重点试验”或只停留在少数互助组、典型户的狭小范围，逐渐成了有计划、有领导、有广大农民参加的群众性运动。联村技术推广网，是在村技术普遍发展的基础上，建立的一种中心组织，由几个村技术组长、劳动模范等联合组成，在国营农场的指导下，经常定期集会，交流和推广技术经验。这种组织名称不一，有的叫技术推广站，有的叫技术传授站、中心技术站或联村技术研究委员会。据统计：山西全省已有七千一百二十三个村技术委员会和二百四十五个技术传授站。河北省农村平均每五个村就有一个技术组，联村技术推广网也已建立了不少。
    国营农场在技术改良运动中的领导作用日益显著。山西省六十一个农场，去年就领导了六千多个村技术委员会，训练过三万多劳动模范和技术能手。今年它们领导的村技术组织更多了，而且在各地建立了许多农村技术推广网。阳曲农场和离石农场等五个模范的县农场，今年就训练了很多村干部和积极农民，并依赖这些人建立了四百多个村技术委员会，七十六个小农场。平原省莘县农场经常联系着二十二个技术网、十九个小农场和一百一十九村的三百一十户特约农户，按时地派技术人员巡回对它们进行技术指导。今春该农场向这些组织推广了粒选技术和双套犁挑沟植棉的耕作法。各地农场按季节地经常地进行指导，使技术改良工作不断提高。
    农业生产先进经验的有计划推广，是今年农业技术改良中的一个显著特点。今年，华北在推广农业先进经验时，除运用技术训练班、技术传授站、技术推广网等技术组织外，并发动农民参观劳动模范的农场，由劳动模范亲自讲解他们的经验。曲耀离的家乡山西解县，今年全县十一万五千亩棉田，全部是按照曲耀离的全苗匀种密植法种的，每亩留苗由过去平均二千多株增加到三千株左右。施肥和耕耙数量也有增加，全县施用细肥的棉田比去年增加了十倍。河北省棉花丰产模范村石家庄市郊城角庄，今春在劳动模范梁家瑞领导下推行棉花密植法，使全村大部棉田做到每亩比去年增加八、九百株。该村技术组织每半月研究一次植棉技术，按季节推广了间苗、除虫、施肥、棉田管理等先进经验。
    在农业技术改良运动中，华北今年有大批的农民受了科学知识和科学技术的训练。他们是劳动模范、互助组长和村干部，成为进一步提高和推广技术的桥梁。河北省邢台县今年就有一万一千四百多劳动模范、互助组长，学会了棉花定苗、保苗、追肥、除蚜等技术。河北省六月间曾开展技术传授月运动，六月间河北省人民政府派了两千名农业科学技术人员，携带大批喷雾器、农药、病虫害挂图等深入农村，以座谈、展览、演习等方式广泛向农民传授技术、训练干部，掀起了全省农民学习技术的高潮。一个月中，他们在全省建立了三千个技术传授站，至少有三百到五百万人受到了他们的训练。山西省则提倡每一个农村工作干部都要学会技术，他们下乡工作同时把技术带下乡去。（新华社）
