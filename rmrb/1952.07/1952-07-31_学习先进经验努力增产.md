    Learning from Advanced Experience to Strive for Increased Production
    Editor: Previously, we had 80 people working on the malleable iron furnace in our factory. They were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat or use the restroom. However, we only produced 70,000 sets of silk hinges per month. Since learning Yang Shouxun's double-scale molding method and assembly line operation method, the entire group has been reduced to 60 workers, but production has increased more than four times. Furthermore, the work is more planned than before, and we now have time to read newspapers and study technology every day. This has further encouraged the workers to learn from advanced experience, find ways, and discover tricks, correcting the mistaken views of the workers in our factory in the past regarding learning from advanced experience. Such as fearing the increase of quotas, fearing the increase of labor intensity, fearing getting exhausted, as well as the conservative thinking of looking down on advanced experience, etc. This time, the higher authorities gave us the task of increasing production and practicing economy with a value equivalent to 8,475 tons of grain. Because we learned from advanced experience, everyone believes that we can complete 52,585 tons, exceeding the task given by the higher authorities by more than six times. We deeply realize that learning from advanced experience is indeed the most effective way to do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy.

    Editor: Since last October, all the staff and workers in our group have actively participated in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. We realize that promoting advanced production experience and finding tricks are the basic methods for increasing production and practicing economy. During the campaign, we humbly learned from the advanced experience of the Beijing Flour Factory, combined with the specific conditions of our own factory, improved the machines, and fully exerted the potential of the machines. Therefore, since last November, our production has been steadily increasing. Now, our output has more than doubled the output during the enemy and puppet regime. In the future, we hope that the newspaper will introduce more advanced production experience to us.

    学习先进经验努力增产
    编辑同志：以前我们厂有八十人在韧铁炉上工作，每天忙的连吃饭和大小便的时间都没有，但一个月只做出七万件丝对。自从学习了杨守训的双称造型法和流水作业法以后，全组减到六十名工友，生产却提高了四倍以上，并且工作比从前更有计划，每天有了读报和研究技术的时间了。这更加鼓舞了工友们学习先进经验，想办法，找窍门的情绪，纠正了我厂工人过去对学习先进经验的错误看法。如怕提高定额，怕提高劳动强度，怕累坏了，以及瞧不起先进经验的保守思想等。这次上级给我们增产节约价值相当于八千四百七十五吨粮食的任务，由于我们学习了先进经验，大家认为可完成五万二千五百八十五吨，超过上级给的任务六倍以上。我们深刻地认识了学习先进经验，确是搞好增产节约的最有效办法。        沈阳机械十二厂  顾众
    编辑同志：自去年十月以后，我们全组职工便积极参加了增产节约竞赛运动。我们认识到推广先进生产经验、找窍门，是增产节约的基本方法。在运动中，我们虚心学习了北京面粉厂的先进经验，结合自己厂内的具体情况，改进了机器，充分发挥了机器的潜在力。因此，自去年十一月以后，我们的生产便步步上升。现在，我们的产量已超过敌伪时的产量一倍多。今后，希望报纸多给我们介绍先进生产经验。
