Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Currently, all rivers across the country have entered the flood season. People throughout the country, under the leadership of flood control command organizations at all levels, have been organized and are prepared to wage a resolute struggle against this year's floods.

The general situation of rivers across the country is as follows: the mainstreams of major rivers are stable, while the water levels of several tributaries in the south and local rivers are high or relatively high. The Han River in the Yangtze River Basin, the Ying River and Ru River in the Huai River Basin, the North River and East River in the Pearl River Basin, the Guangdong Moyang River, the Guangxi Gantang River, Hua River, Li River, Rong River, the Tang River and Bai River in Henan, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers in the Dongting Lake Basin of Hunan, the Gan and Fu rivers in the Poyang Lake Basin of Jiangxi, various rivers in Fujian and Zhejiang in the East China region, and the upper reaches of various rivers in the Southwest region have all exceeded the warning or danger water levels. Some rivers, such as the Fu River, Li River, Tang River, and the Diao River, a tributary of the Bai River, have even exceeded the highest flood levels in previous years or the highest flood level of last year. In North China, the Zhang River in the South Canal Basin and the Dongyang River in the Yongding River Basin briefly exceeded the danger water level in early July. In addition, the Guangdong area in the lower reaches of the Pearl River has been hit by typhoons three times.

In order to organize and lead the people of the country to victoriously fight the floods, the Central Flood Control Headquarters was established on June 1st, and flood control or flood and drought control command organizations have been established in various regions. The Central South region, due to the earlier flood season, established its Flood Control Headquarters as early as April 15th. The Yellow River and Huai River Flood Control Headquarters were also established on June 20th and July 1st, respectively.

Currently, the masses along the rivers, under the leadership of flood control command organizations at all levels, have been organized to inspect embankments and eliminate hidden dangers in the embankments. By the end of June, the three provinces of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong along the Yellow River had inspected a total of 7,924 holes of various sizes in the embankments and captured 1,106 harmful animals. In early June, Lixian County, Hunan Province, conducted a comprehensive inspection of the embankments throughout the county, discovering over 110 dangerous works, animal burrows, and cracks on the embankments in just a few days, all of which have now been repaired and blocked. At the same time, various localities are actively preparing for emergency rescue materials. The Subei region launched a "one character" movement, calling on the masses to contribute one pile, one mat, one rope, etc., for centralized reserve. The Jingjiang and Hanjiang rivers began embankment inspection and processing projects in mid-May. During three embankment inspections and processing efforts in Jianli County, a total of over 47,000 cubic meters of earthwork were completed, and 129 badger holes were filled. The 320,000-strong flood control army in the Jingzhou area has been formed. On the Jingjiang Dam, which is over 130 kilometers long, 130 sentry posts have been set up. In the Anhui region, over 232,000 workers in the riverfront and polder areas have participated in flood control organizations, collected over 991,600 piles of wood of various sizes, and over 1,000 sacks and straw bags; and completed 66 kilometers of wave-blocking projects for polder dikes, repaired 74 kilometers of dangerous embankments, repaired 438 collapses, renovated 40 leaks, and built 1,350 work sheds.

In order to grasp the water situation in a timely manner, the river reporting agencies have begun reporting flood conditions. Since July 2nd, all rainfall stations, water level stations, hydrological stations, and radio stations along the Yellow River have been fully notified. The Huai River Basin has 53 wired telegraph flood reporting stations, 9 radio flood reporting stations, and a total of 67 flood reporting locations; in addition, 21 flood reporting stations under the leadership of other water conservancy agencies have also begun flood reporting work. Currently, the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters is rushing to repair three special ships for emergency use.

Currently, no excessively high flood peaks have appeared in rivers across the country, and no dangers have occurred under strict precautions. However, some areas have experienced sudden heavy rainfall and flash floods. In the Southwest region of Guizhou, and the Central South regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, in addition to submerging farmland, many small-scale water conservancy projects have also been destroyed. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has dispatched an investigation team to cooperate with personnel from the Central South Water Conservancy Department to investigate the damage to small ponds and reservoirs and study remedial measures. In addition, it plans to dispatch a group of technical cadres to cooperate with the Central South Water Conservancy Department to conduct typical investigations and planning in Jiangxi Province in order to find a thorough solution to flash flood disasters.

Currently, flood control has entered an emergency period. The Central Flood Control Headquarters believes that some shortcomings in flood control and emergency rescue work have been exposed in some areas: such as poor project quality, gaps or road openings in dikes not being blocked, unsound flood reporting work, and some cadres and the masses in areas with less rainfall still exhibiting complacency and carelessness. As a serious flood control struggle is about to arrive, the people along the rivers throughout the country must be mobilized urgently, overcome any harmful thoughts of complacency and carelessness, actively and meticulously inspect embankments and dangerous works, carry out necessary repairs and strengthening work, fully prepare materials and carry out other preparations; flood control agencies at all levels should conduct a comprehensive inspection of the flood control work arrangements, material preparations, mass organization mobilization, and the work of various flood reporting stations in their respective jurisdictions, requiring that all preparatory work be done to ensure preparedness so that they can confidently overcome even greater floods in the future.

    全国各江河进入汛期
    各地开始检查并加强防汛工作
    【新华社十九日讯】目前全国各河都已进入汛期，全国各地人民，在各级防汛指挥机构的领导下，已经组织起来，准备向今年的洪水做坚决斗争。
    目前全国各河总的情况是：各大江、大河干流水势平稳，而南方的若干支流及地方性河流的水势却很大或较大。长江流域的汉水，淮河流域的颍河、汝河，珠江流域的北江、东江，广东漠阳江，广西甘棠江、华江、漓江、榕江，河南唐河、白河，湖南洞庭湖流域湘、资、沅、澧四水，江西鄱阳湖流域赣、抚等河，华东区福建、浙江各河及西南区各河上游，都曾超过了警戒水位或危险水位，其中部分河流，如抚水、漓江、唐河、白河的支流刁河等并超过了历年最高洪水位或去年最高洪水位。华北方面，南运河流域的漳河及永定河流域的东洋河在七月上旬曾一度超过危险水位。此外，珠江下游广东一带，曾三次遭到台风袭击。
    为了组织与领导全国人民胜利地向洪水做斗争，中央防汛总指挥部在六月一日即已成立，各地区也先后组成了防汛或防汛抗旱指挥机构。中南区因汛期较早，该区防汛总指挥部早在四月十五日即已成立。黄河及淮河防汛总指挥部也已分别在六月二十日及七月一日成立。
    现在沿河群众已在各级防汛指挥机构领导下，组织起来，检查堤防，消灭堤防隐患，黄河沿岸河南、平原、山东三省截至六月底共检查出堤上大小洞穴七九二四个，捕获害兽一一○六只。湖南澧县六月初全县进行堤防大检查，几天内就发现险工、兽穴、堤上裂缝等一百数十处，现都已修复堵塞。同时各地并积极准备抢险物料。苏北地区曾发起一字运动，号召群众拿出一根桩，一张席，一条绳等，集中备用。荆江、汉江五月中旬便开始查堤加工工程。监利县三次查堤加工中，共完成土方四万七千多方，填塞獾穴一百二十九个。荆州专区三十二万防汛大军业已组成。荆江大堤全长一百三十多公里堤段上，已扎好哨棚一百三十个。安徽地区沿江河圩区已有二十三万二千多个民工参加了防汛组织，筹集了大小桩木九十九万一千六百多根、麻袋草包一千多条；并已做好六十六公里长的圩堤挡浪工程，整修了七十四公里险埂，修复了四百三十八处塌坡，翻修了四十处漏洞，搭好了一千三百五十个工棚。
    为了及时地掌握水情，各河报汛机构都已开始报汛。七月二日起，黄河沿河所有雨量站、水位站、水文站、电台已全部通报。淮河流域设有有线电报汛站五十三个，无线电专台报汛站九个，报汛地点共有六十七处；还有其他水利机关领导的二十一处报汛站，也都已开始了报汛工作。目前淮河防汛总指挥部正在赶修三只专轮以应急用。
    现在全国各河还未出现过高的洪峰，在严格防范下还未发生险象。但是有些地区因陡降暴雨，山洪暴发，如西南区的贵州，中南区的广东、广西、江西，除淹没田地外，小型水利工程也被冲毁很多。中央人民政府水利部已派出调查组会同中南水利部人员调查小型塘堰冲毁情况，研究补救办法，此外，并计划派出一批技术干部，配合中南水利部前往江西省做典型的调查、规划，以便找出彻底解决山洪灾害的办法。
    目前防汛已进入紧急时期，中央防汛总指挥部认为：某些地区已暴露出防汛抢险工作中的一些缺点：如工程质量不好，堤防的缺口或路口未堵，报汛工作不健全，部分少雨地区干部群众还存在着麻痹大意的现象等。在严重的防汛斗争即将到来的今天，全国各地沿河人民，必须紧张动员起来，克服任何麻痹大意的有害思想，积极地细致地检查堤防、险工，进行必要的修补加强工作，充分准备物料及进行其他准备工作；各级防汛机构，应对所辖地区的防汛工作布置、物料准备、群众组织动员及各报汛站的工作情况，普遍地进行一次检查，要求在一切准备工作上做到有备无患，以便有把握地战胜今后更大的洪水。
