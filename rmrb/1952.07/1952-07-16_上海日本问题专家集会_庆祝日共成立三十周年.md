    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th: Members of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, along with researchers of Japanese and international issues, held a symposium to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. More than 30 people attended the symposium, including Wang Yunsheng, Wang Zaoshi, Shi Xiaochong, Wang Minzhi, Li Chunqing, Jin Zhonghua, Jin Xuecheng, Xia Yan, and Liu Simu.
    The symposium was presided over by Xia Yan, director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Xia Yan said: "At a time when American imperialism is conspiring to rearm Japan and launch a new war, and the Japanese people are bravely struggling for the establishment of an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party has special and great significance. In addition to expressing our respect to the Japanese Communist Party, which is leading the Japanese people in their heroic struggle, we should strengthen the solidarity between the Chinese and Japanese people, especially the united front of the Chinese and Japanese people against imperialism, in order to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world." Wang Yunsheng, Wang Zaoshi, Jin Xuecheng, Shi Xiaochong, Liu Simu, Jin Zhonghua, and others then spoke, unanimously expressing their warm respect to the leader, organizer, and inspirer of the Japanese revolution—the Japanese Communist Party, and pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people is not isolated. With the sympathy and active support of the Chinese, Soviet, and all peace-loving people of the world, the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory. Finally, the attendees unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party.

    上海日本问题专家集会

    【新华社上海十五日电】中国人民外交学会在上海的会员和日本问题、国际问题的研究者举行座谈会，庆祝日本共产党成立三十周年。出席座谈会的有王芸生、王造时、石啸冲、汪敏之、李纯青、金仲华、金学成、夏衍、刘思慕等三十多人。
    座谈会由中国人民外交学会理事夏衍主持。夏衍说：“在美帝国主义阴谋重新武装日本、发动新战争，日本人民英勇地为建立独立、民主与爱好和平的日本而斗争的时候，纪念日本共产党成立三十周年的生日，具有特别重大的意义。我们除向领导日本人民作英勇斗争的日本共产党致以敬意外，并应加强中日两国人民的团结，特别是加强中、日两国人民反帝国主义的统一战线，以保卫远东及世界持久和平。”接着讲话的有王芸生、王造时、金学成、石啸冲、刘思慕、金仲华等，他们一致向日本革命的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者——日本共产党致以热烈的敬礼，并指出日本人民的斗争不是孤立的。有着中国、苏联及全世界爱好和平人民的同情与积极支援，日本人民必然获得最后胜利。最后，到会者一致通过了向日本共产党中央委员会的致敬电。
