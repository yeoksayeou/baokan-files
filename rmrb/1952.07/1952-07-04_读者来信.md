    Beijing resident Lü Li's "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting" treatment for tuberculosis is a complete swindle.
    Editor's Note: In May and June of last year, many readers wrote to this newspaper requesting that the People's Government allow Beijing citizen Lü Li to use "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting" to treat tuberculosis. At the time, we considered this a matter concerning the people's life and health, and that it should be handled with caution. We forwarded these opinions to the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, asking them to find a way to conduct trials. The results of four months of trials proved that Lü Li's "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting" was a complete charlatan's trick. To protect the health of the people and eliminate this fraudulent practice, the Beijing Municipal People's Court must deal with this incident in a timely manner.
    Lü Li, a resident of No. 48 Niangniang Temple Hutong, 7th Alley, Dongsi Pailou, Beijing, once claimed to have over 20 years of practical experience and could treat tuberculosis with "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting." She used an unsterilized long-handled knife to scrape the patient's throat wall until it bled. At this point, she would have the patient cough vigorously for several minutes to cough up the blood, then rinse with vinegar. Each surgical procedure took only a few minutes (performed every three to four days, continuously for three to five months).
    In order to protect the people's life and health, we convened Lü Li and a group of patients to discuss scientifically testing this medical skill. On August 8, 1951, under the guidance of the Beijing Anti-Tuberculosis Association, formal trials began. A total of 58 people voluntarily participated in the trials. These individuals had all undergone X-ray examinations beforehand, proving they had tuberculosis, and Lü Li believed they could be cured. After four months, most people had received 25 or 26 "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting" treatments. In early December, these patients underwent a general X-ray examination. The results showed one death, nineteen deteriorations (two of whom died successively in December due to worsening conditions), thirty-three with little or no change, and five with slight improvement. Of the 58 cases, six were considered cured by Lü Li, but X-rays proved that most of their conditions had worsened.
    Based on the results of this trial, we convened a patient forum on December 8th of last year. Tuberculosis expert Dr. Kan Guanqing publicly announced the examination results and showed the X-rays to everyone. Dr. Kan pointed out many shortcomings of the "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting" on the spot:
    1. Prolonged vegetarian diet for patients, resulting in a lack of animal protein nutrition in the patients' diets.
    2. Causing patients to lose blood once every three to four days (i.e., throat-pricking bleeding), lasting for three to five months, which is very harmful to the patient.
    3. The surgical procedure requires patients to cough vigorously for several minutes, causing severe vibrations in the patient's lungs, which is contrary to the principles of tuberculosis treatment. The result is not only easy to spread and disseminate tuberculosis but also makes it easier for patients to experience hemoptysis.
    This trial exposed the secret of Lü Li's "Throat-Pricking Bloodletting." Patients unanimously demanded that the People's Government punish Lü Li for defrauding people of money and harming lives.

    Students Help Companies Develop Recreational Activities
    Editor's Note: At the forum on literary and artistic work in the armed forces convened by this newspaper, some soldiers reflected that they hoped someone could go to guide recreational activities in their companies. After reading the forum's record in the newspaper, the Dong Ruohuan group from Class 1, Grade 2 of the High School Attached to Beijing Normal University for Girls requested that this newspaper introduce them to helping soldiers learn to sing and dance in their time outside of study. They have now started this activity and have been warmly welcomed by the soldiers and valued by the leadership of the armed forces. We believe that it is worthwhile to encourage students to carry out such social activities on the principle that their studies, health and other activities on campus are not affected, and with the consent of the school leadership.

    Comrade Editor: After seeing the record of the forum on literary and artistic work in the armed forces, "To Better Serve the Soldiers", published in the People's Daily, the entire group of students led by Dong Ruohuan, Class 1, Grade 2 of the High School Attached to Beijing Normal University for Girls, learned that the armed forces needed cultural life. They were very enthusiastic and happy to ask the Literary and Artistic Section of the Cultural Department of the North China Military Region to volunteer their extracurricular time to go deep into the companies to help soldiers carry out recreational activities on the one hand, and to learn from the soldiers on the other. Now, the Literary and Artistic Section of the Cultural Department of the North China Military Region has assigned the Dong Ruohuan group to our unit. Their enthusiasm for helping us has deeply moved us. We only have one determination: "Practice martial arts well and improve our skills to defend our motherland, so that their studies will not be violated by any imperialism." From 5:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on June 14th (originally scheduled to end at 9:00 p.m., but the atmosphere was so high that it was extended by an hour and a half), the students tirelessly and patiently taught the soldiers group dances and group games. On that day, the soldiers learned two group games and three group dances. Thanks to their patient, sincere and enthusiastic help, comrades such as cooks Zhao Bingrong and Han Gui, who did not like to participate in recreational activities in our unit, were also motivated. Some comrades were still singing and practicing their movements in their mouths after returning to the dormitory. In short, thanks to the enthusiastic help of the students, our recreational activities have been initially enlivened.
                                        Chen Zongyin, Artillery Unit of the People's Liberation Army

    Comrade Editor: When the comrades of our Youth League group saw the record of the forum "To Better Serve the Soldiers" published in the People's Daily, everyone thought: The soldiers are so urgently demanding cultural life, what should we do? We believe that it is our responsibility and the glorious duty of the Youth League members to do things for the soldiers. Therefore, all the comrades in our group unanimously agreed to take time out of our spare time to help the soldiers carry out recreational activities and do our best to enrich the recreational life of the soldiers. The next day, we wrote a letter to the People's Daily asking them to introduce us. With the help of the comrades of the People's Daily, we quickly contacted the Literary and Artistic Section of the Cultural Department of the North China Military Region. Now, our group has established contact with a certain company and started the first activity.
    On the afternoon of June 14th, starting from 5:00, we danced and sang with the soldiers until after 10:00. In this activity, we gained a lot. The soldiers are very serious when they learn, even though it is difficult for them to learn. But they are all very confident, learning over and over again; they will not give up until they have learned it and sang it well. This spirit has given us a great education. It has become the driving force for our studies.
    When we are with the soldiers, we feel very kind and very happy. The many good qualities of the soldiers are worth learning from.
    This is a beginning, and there will be more opportunities to contact the soldiers in the future. We will do a good job in tutoring the soldiers' recreational activities, and we will learn the excellent qualities of the soldiers even more.
    Dong Ruohuan, Third Group of Class 1, Grade 2 of the High School Attached to Beijing Normal University for Girls

    Artillery Unit Values Soldiers' Recreational Activities
    Comrade Editor: The current situation of the cultural life of soldiers in the armed forces is exactly as pointed out in the article "To Better Serve the Soldiers," a record of the soldiers' literary and artistic forum published in the People's Daily on May 26. We discovered this situation in mid-May and made preliminary improvements. We also sent people to various units to find out the situation, and discussed it at the Party Committee meeting, and made a resolution to make recreational activities a part of the normal life of the armed forces. Our specific methods for improving the recreational life of the armed forces are roughly as follows:
    1. Implement the Party Committee's resolution and supplement new content, so that the Party's leadership ensures that administrative organizations and mass organizations universally carry out recreational activities.
    2. Convene special meetings and meetings related to promoting this work to explain the importance of this work and how it can be carried out by leading organs and leading cadres.
    3. Stipulated the time for carrying out recreational activities. It is determined that the change or occupation of time must be approved by the political commissar of the regiment, otherwise no unit or individual can take the recreational time without authorization to ensure the development of cultural and recreational work.
    4. Clubs were established in each unit. Specifically, it is divided into sports and health, cultural entertainment, study and reading newspapers, wall newspapers and other organizations. At the same time, in order to carry out various entertainment and sports activities, all units voluntarily adopted the method of absorbing everyone to participate under these organizations. Including: basketball, volleyball, baseball, dance, singing, track and field, gymnastics, drama, etc. These items are the focus of our current recreational activities.
    5. We require cadres at all levels to participate in this activity personally, not only to lead and master it, but also to become the backbone and leader of recreational activities. The participation of cadres can better close the relationship between cadres and soldiers, and also ensure the development of the movement.
    6. Because the leadership has not paid attention to recreational activities in the past, we have not accumulated much experience. We are now determined to use one unit as a key test, and through the test, absorb experience and guide the overall situation. In order to allow the troops to observe each other, we will organize competitions regularly to learn from each other and supervise each other. The leadership must also regularly include this work as part of the summary report to summarize experience and commend good units and criticize particularly bad units.
    7. We must contact nearby agencies, troops, and schools to get their help, especially the students. We have already started doing this.
    The above is only based on our level and what we can do. If we cannot do it, we will try our best to suggest solutions to the higher authorities.
                                        Political Department of an Artillery Unit of the People's Liberation Army

    北京吕李氏治疗肺结核病的“刺喉放血术”是一套骗局
    编者按：去年五六月间，不少读者给本报来信，要求人民政府允许北京市民吕李氏用“刺喉放血术”治疗肺结核病。我们当时考虑到这是一个有关人民生命健康的问题，应该慎重处理，就把这些意见，转给北京市公共卫生局，请他们设法进行试验。四个月试验的结果，证明吕李氏的“刺喉放血术”完全是一套江湖骗术。为了保障人民的健康，肃清这种欺诈的作风，北京市人民法院必须及时地处理这一事件。
    北京市东四牌楼七条娘娘庙胡同四十八号住户吕李氏，曾经自称有二十多年的实际经验，能以“刺喉放血术”治疗肺结核病。她用未经消毒的长柄小刀，刮刺病人的咽壁，直到流出血来。这时，她又让病人猛力咳嗽数分钟，将血咳净，然后用醋漱口。每次施行手术的时间不过数分钟（每隔三四日施行手术一次，连续进行三至五个月）。
    我们为了保障人民的生命健康，曾召集吕李氏和一部分病人，商量以科学方法，试验这种医术。一九五一年八月八日在北京市防痨协会指导下，正式开始试验。自愿参加试验的共有五十八人，这些人事先都是经过X光检查，证明确有肺结核病，吕李氏又认为能够治愈的。经过四个月，大多数人都接受了二十五六次“刺喉放血术”的治疗。十二月初这些病人普遍进行了一次X光检查，结果死亡者一人，恶化者十九人（其中有二人因病情转剧于十二月间相继死亡），大致无改变者三十三人，稍有好转者五人。在五十八个病例中，有六例是吕李氏认为已经痊愈了的，但经X光片证明，大部病情都恶化了。
    根据这一试验情况，我们在去年十二月八日召开了一次患者座谈会，由肺痨专家阚冠卿大夫当众公布检查结果，并拿X光片给大家观察。阚大夫当场指出“刺喉放血术”的许多缺点：
    一、长期令病人素食，结果使患者在饮食中缺乏动物蛋白的营养。
    二、每隔三四日使患者失血一次（即刺喉出血），延续三至五个月之久，这对病人是很有害的。
    三、施行手术时要患者猛力咳嗽数分钟，使患者肺部受到剧烈震动，这和肺病治疗原则是相违背的。其结果不但易使肺结核扩展和散布，更易使患者发生喀血现象。
    这一试验，揭穿了吕李氏“刺喉放血术”的秘密。患者一致要求人民政府惩办骗财害人的吕李氏。

    同学们帮助连队开展文娱活动
    编者按：在本报召开的部队文艺工作座谈会上，有些战士反映，他们希望有人能去辅导连队中的文娱活动。青年团北京师范大学附属女子中学高中二年级一班董若环小组读到报上的座谈会记录后，就要求本报介绍她们在学习以外的时间去帮助战士学习唱歌、舞蹈。现在她们已经开始了这一活动，获得了战士们的热烈欢迎和部队领导方面的重视。我们认为同学们在不妨碍自己的学习、健康和校内其他活动的原则下，并取得学校领导方面的同意后，进行这样的社会活动，是值得鼓励的。
    编辑同志：青年团北京师范大学附属女子中学高中二年级一班董若环小组全体同学，看到人民日报刊登的部队文艺座谈会的记录后，知道部队需要文化生活，她们很热情、很高兴地向华北军区文化部文艺科要求，愿意在自己的课外活动时间，深入连队，一方面帮助战士们开展文娱活动，另一方面向战士们学习。现在，华北军区文化部文艺科，已经把董若环小组分配到我们部队。他们这种对我们帮助的热情，使我们很受感动。我们只有一个决心：“好好练武，提高技术来保卫我们的祖国，使他们的学习不受任何帝国主义的侵犯。”六月十四日下午五点钟到十点半（原计划在九点钟结束，因为大家的情绪很高，就延长了一个半钟头），同学们不辞疲劳地、耐心地教战士们集体舞和集体游戏。那一天战士们学会了两个集体游戏，三个集体舞蹈。由于她们耐心、诚恳、热情的帮助，把我们部队里不爱参加文娱活动的炊事员赵炳荣和韩贵等同志也带动起来了。有的同志回到宿舍以后，嘴里还在唱着、练习着动作。总之，由于同学们的热情帮助，我们的文娱活动已初步地活跃起来了。

    编辑同志：当我们青年团小组的同志们看到人民日报所载“要更好地为兵服务”的座谈会记录以后，大家想：战士是这样迫切要求文娱生活，我们怎么办呢？为战士作事情，我们认为是我们的责任，也是青年团员的光荣义务。于是我们全组的同志一致同意抽出课余时间去帮助战士开展文娱活动，尽我们的力量来丰富战士们的文娱生活内容。第二天我们就给人民日报写了一封信，请他们介绍。经过人民日报的同志帮助，我们便迅速和华北军区文化部文艺科取得了联系。现在，我们小组已经和某连队建立了联系，并开始了第一次活动。
    六月十四日下午，从五点钟开始，我们便和战士在一起跳舞、唱歌，一直到十点多才结束。在这次活动中，我们有很多收获。战士们学的时候是非常认真的，虽然他们学起来很困难。但是他们都很有信心，一遍又一遍地学；非学会了，唱好了才罢休。这种精神给了我们很大的教育。它变成了我们学习上的动力。
    当我们和战士在一起时，感到非常亲切，非常高兴，战士们许多好的品质都是值得我们学习的。
    这是一个开始，以后和战士们联系的机会将要更多了。我们要作好对战士文娱活动的辅导工作，更要学习战士的优秀品质。

    炮兵某部重视战士文娱活动
    编辑同志：现在部队战士文化生活的情况，正像人民日报五月二十六日刊登的战士文艺座谈会记录“要更好地为兵服务”一文中所指出的情况。这种情况，我们在五月中旬就已发觉，并进行了初步的改善。我们又派人到各部队进行了解，并在党委会上进行讨论，作了决议，使文娱活动成为部队正常生活的一部分。我们改进部队文娱生活的具体办法大致如下：
    一、贯彻党委决议，并补充新的内容，以党的领导，保证行政组织、群众组织普遍地开展文娱活动。
    二、召开专门会议和有关推进这个工作的会议，说明这个工作的重要性，及如何由领导机关和领导干部保证开展起来。
    三、规定了开展文娱活动的时间。确定了时间的变更或是占用，必须经过团政治委员的批准，否则任何单位和个人都不能擅自占去文娱时间，以保证文化娱乐工作的开展。
    四、在各单位内成立了俱乐部。具体分为体育卫生、文化娱乐、学习读报、墙报等组织。同时为了各种娱乐和体育活动的开展，在这几个组织下面采取了全部队自愿的，吸收人人参加的办法。包括：篮球、排球、棒球、舞蹈、歌咏、田径、器械操、戏剧等。这些项目是我们目前文娱活动的重点。
    五、我们要求各级干部亲自参加这一活动，不但是领导和掌握，并应成为文娱活动的骨干和带头者。干部的参加更能密切干部和战士的关系，也保证了运动的开展。
    六、由于领导方面过去对文娱活动的不重视，所以我们积累的经验不多。我们现在确定以一个单位作为重点试验，通过试验，吸收经验，指导全盘。为了使各部队之间互相观摩，我们将定期组织比赛，以便互相学习、互相督促。领导方面还要定期把这一工作作为总结报告内容之一，以总结经验，并表扬好的单位，批评特别坏的单位。
    七、我们要和附近的机关、部队、学校取得联系，以得到他们的帮助，特别是学校的同学。现在我们已经开始这样作了。
    以上只是根据我们的水平和我们能办到的事情提出的，属于我们不能办到的，当尽力向上级建议解决。
