How to Organize Labor Mutual Aid in the Drought Prevention and Resistance Movement
    Lü Hongcai

The widespread organization of labor mutual aid is a crucial element in completing drought prevention and resistance work. Based on past experiences in various regions, labor mutual aid can play the following main roles in drought prevention and resistance efforts:

    I. Concentrating manpower and resources to overcome difficulties that individual farmers cannot overcome, ensuring the completion of drought resistance, sowing, and soil moisture preservation and seedling protection, and promoting the development of water conservancy projects. Last year in Wuqiao County, Pingyuan Province, during the drought resistance and cotton planting campaign, most of the male labor force participated in levee restoration work, resulting in an extreme shortage of labor. However, the cotton field planting plan had to be completed. The local leading authorities mobilized women and male semi-laborers to organize mutual aid teams, utilizing all available water lifting tools and implementing a rational division of labor: strong women carried water, children dug holes for sowing, old men provided technical guidance, and old women looked after children. This overcame the labor shortage and smoothly completed the cotton planting plan. Last year, Chahar Province suffered a severe drought, with only 40% of normal yields. The mutual aid team led by Yang Shunkui, a labor model in the province, achieved a bumper harvest by implementing a series of soil moisture preservation and seedling protection measures such as early plowing, diligent plowing, multiple harrowing, multiple rolling, early weeding, and multiple weeding. The team's 87 mu of land yielded an average of 296 jin of grain per mu, exceeding the yield of ordinary households by 106 jin. His personal 1.8 mu of dryland millet yielded 1,424 jin, or 790 jin per mu. Xu Guirong, a labor model in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, united 15 mutual aid teams in the village last year during a severe drought, organizing 30 waterwheels to lift water and irrigate fields over several miles of mountains, overcoming the drought. Some farmers said, "Land reform has liberated people, and labor mutual aid has made water climb mountains." Pei Xingchen, a labor model in Daming County, Hebei Province, organized a credit cooperative with 98 households last spring, raising 20,000 jin of funds and grain. During the well-digging campaign, they transformed the credit cooperative into a well-digging mutual aid society. When there were no bricks for digging wells, they mobilized everyone to borrow from relatives and friends. In this way, the whole village dug 18 wells, drilled 17 wells, and repaired three old wells. In Laozhuang Village, a mountainous area of ​​Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, in the past, people had to fetch water from mountain springs eight miles away for cooking during droughts. However, under the leadership of Niu Ruqing, a drought resistance model, the masses were organized to dig 14 water cellars to store rainwater from summer and autumn, not only solving the problem of drinking water but also overcoming the drought and achieving a bumper harvest, turning a poor village into a wealthy one.

    II. Rational water use, giving full play to the irrigation effectiveness of water, and saving a large amount of labor and funds. In the vicinity of the Yangwu River in Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, thanks to the organization of irrigation mutual aid teams, 110,000 mu of land were irrigated this spring, exceeding the original plan by 30,000 mu, and saving 43,000 workdays compared to previous years. A single farmer can generally only irrigate a dozen mu of land with one well, but well-managed wells organized into teams can irrigate 20 to 50 mu each. In some villages in Boye and Li County, Hebei Province, mutual aid teams adopted the method of connecting wells and raising well platforms, irrigating day and night. Some wells irrigated more than 140 mu, making one well as efficient as three or four.

    In carrying out drought prevention and resistance campaigns, how can the masses be quickly organized? The following are some key experiences from various regions:

    I. Strengthening patriotic production increase political education and implementing reward policies for water conservancy construction are the best ways to mobilize the masses to organize and carry out drought prevention and resistance. Drought prevention and resistance is an extremely arduous task. Therefore, in addition to fully conducting ideological mobilization, breaking the conservative thinking of farmers who "rely on the heavens for rain," and establishing a firm belief in "man can conquer nature," the main thing is to strengthen patriotic production increase education and implement reward policies for water conservancy construction. This should enable farmers to deeply realize that drought prevention and resistance work is not only about growing more grain for themselves but also about enhancing the strength of national defense and economic construction for the country. Implementing reward policies for water conservancy construction can further encourage and increase farmers' enthusiasm for water conservancy construction. Last year, when Gaoghuang Village in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, launched a well-digging campaign, it publicized the great political significance of patriotic production increase and explained the government's reward policy of not increasing the burden for private investment in water conservancy construction for five years. The farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm rapidly increased. Many farmers sought partners and dug wells together. In just a few days, 153 households dug 37 wells. Last year, in the drought resistance, sowing, and seedling protection campaign in Linbao Village, Li County, the county and district drought resistance work teams conducted publicity and mobilization among farmers, calling on households with wells to automatically let their neighbors use water and expand the irrigated area. They explained that helping neighbors irrigate land and increase production would increase the strength of the country, which would be a concrete manifestation of patriotism. As a result, the political consciousness of the farmers in the whole village was greatly improved. Households with wells took the initiative to find neighbors to help irrigate the land, increasing the average area irrigated by each of the 85 wells in the village from 24 mu to 70 mu. The village increased its production of seed cotton (most of the village's land is planted with cotton) by more than 102,000 jin.

    II. Mobilizing Party members, League members, labor models, and activists to take the lead in organizing mutual aid teams and using practical examples of "mutual aid is better than individual farming" to educate the masses is the most effective way to guide the broad masses to organize. Gao Haitao, a labor model in Liangcheng County, Suiyuan Province, responded to the government's call to increase production after liberation and organized the masses to dig canals. In the past three years, he has opened three main canals and 19 branch canals, totaling 70 miles in length, capable of irrigating more than 27,000 mu of land. Under his publicity and encouragement, a competition movement to organize canal digging was launched in villages throughout the county last year. As a result, a total of more than 300 miles of main and branch canals were completed, increasing the irrigated area by 100,150 mu. The mutual aid team led by labor model Guo Quande in Songjiazhuang, Changzhi Mining Area, Shanxi, took the lead in digging wells last winter and challenged the whole village, launching a village-wide competition to organize well digging. A hundred wells were dug in one winter, and 25 waterwheels were added. In addition, many regions used the method of recalling the pain of drought, publicizing the comparison of yields between dry land and irrigated land, and calculating the increased production and payback period for water conservancy construction to make farmers deeply aware of the benefits of water conservancy construction, quickly organizing many farmers. Hou Zhigui, a labor model in Jinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, traveled to various villages, using his own practical examples: getting a bumper harvest by digging wells and lending waterwheels, building new houses, adding livestock and farm tools, and moving towards a prosperous life in the past three years, to promote the benefits of digging wells and lending waterwheels to the masses. He said, "Each well irrigates 25 mu of land, and each mu can increase production by 140 jin per year for two seasons. 25 mu can increase production by 3,500 jin. Not only can you earn back the waterwheel, but you can also buy a cow." His method of calculating detailed accounts promoted the masses to organize and dig 104 wells and borrow 160 waterwheels.

    III. Addressing the masses' ideological concerns and difficulties in organizing water conservancy construction based on the specific conditions of each region is the key to developing and consolidating mutual aid organizations and carrying out drought prevention and resistance campaigns. After liberation, farmers urgently demanded to increase production and overcome drought. The problem is: on the one hand, most individual farmers do not have the strength to fight against drought; on the other hand, they have various ideological concerns about organizing water conservancy construction. If the leadership can address these specific situations and solve these problems for them, it is not difficult to guide the masses to organize and fight against drought. Last year, Ren Chensheng, a labor model in Wen County, Pingyuan Province, addressed the masses' concerns about the cost of digging wells (in the past, there was a custom of heavy eating and drinking when digging wells), the fear of losing lives (sandy soil is prone to collapse, and the masses have the saying "rather suffer ten thousand years of drought than risk human lives"), and the fear of disputes arising from joint well digging, and proposed methods of saving money, learning well-digging techniques, and signing contracts for joint well digging. He took the lead in digging a well and launched a campaign to organize well digging throughout the district. After each well was dug, the masses happily said, "Another cornucopia has been added." As a result, a total of 173 wells were dug in the district.

    When launching waterwheel and well mutual aid, the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be observed, only in this way can the mutual aid be consolidated. Approximately 2,000 mutual aid teams in Pingyuan Province have signed well-digging (or well-using) contracts and irrigation agreements to guarantee well rights and water rights, which not only consolidated the mutual aid teams but also expanded the irrigated area.

    IV. Strengthening economic support and technical guidance are important factors in developing mutual aid and expanding farmland water conservancy construction. After liberation, the People's Government has given strong support to farmers' farmland water conservancy construction, such as providing loans, supporting brick kilns, and supplying a large number of well-digging equipment through cooperatives in various regions. In terms of technical guidance, many regions have organized well-digging teams and technicians to go to the countryside to guide and help farmers open canals, dig wells, and repair ponds. These measures have played a role in promoting the organization of farmers to carry out water conservancy construction. In 1951, a total of 12,000 wells were dug in Pingyuan Province, and about 60% of them were dug jointly. 16,000 waterwheels were loaned, and more than 80% were loaned jointly. The masses in many key water conservancy villages have a full understanding of the benefits of digging wells and lending waterwheels. They said, "Earn a waterwheel in one year, buy a cow in two years, and there are many benefits in three or four years, love the country and get rich to build tile houses." In Huantai County, Shandong, 70% of the cultivated land is irrigated, and the farmers circulate the song "Waterwheel wells, mandarin duck cans (a kind of irrigation tool), you can eat without relying on the sky." The farmers of Yilin County also sing the song: "Old man heaven, you watch in vain, even in three years of drought, I can eat white noodles."

    At present, there are still many regions that have not organized the masses through water conservancy loans and technical guidance. According to a survey in Tangyin County, Pingyuan Province, last year, loans were given to support farmers in digging more than 700 wells, but 500 of them were dug by farmers individually, forming the phenomenon of "loans being given to those who dig wells regardless of how much irrigation is done." The water sources of the wells in various regions are mostly insufficient. Last year, during the drought resistance and sowing period, the water in the wells used for drinking water in Baoding, Ding County, Shijiazhuang and other regions in Hebei Province was used up. Therefore, technically, we must vigorously promote drilling wells to increase water sources, expand the irrigated area, and consolidate mutual aid organizations.

    在防旱抗旱运动中怎样组织劳动互助
    吕鸿才
    广泛组织劳动互助，是完成防旱、抗旱工作的重要环节。根据各地过去的经验，劳动互助在防旱、抗旱工作中，能够发挥以下几个主要作用。
    一、集中人力、物力，克服个体农民所不能克服的困难，保证完成抗旱下种和保墒、保苗工作，并促进了水利事业的发展。平原省武陟县去年在抗旱植棉运动中，因为男劳力大半参加了复堤工作，劳力极度缺乏，而棉田播种计划又必须完成。当地领导机关发动妇女和男半劳力组织互助组，利用一切汲水工具，实行合理分工：壮年妇女挑水，儿童挖坑下种，老汉指导技术，老太婆看小孩。这就克服了劳力缺乏的困难，顺利地完成了植棉计划。察哈尔省去年遭受严重旱灾，只有四成年景，该省劳动模范杨顺奎领导的互助组，由于做了早耕、勤耕、多耙、多耱、早锄、多锄等一系列的保墒、保苗工作，因而获得丰收。全组八十七亩地，每亩平均产粮二百九十六斤，超过一般户一百零六斤。他个人的一亩八分旱地谷子，收获一千四百二十四斤，每亩收获七百九十斤。浙江省新登县劳动模范许桂荣，去年在旱灾严重的时候，把全村十五个互助组联合起来，组织三十部水车车水，使水翻过几里路的山坡灌到田里，战胜了旱灾。有的农民说：“土地改革使人翻了身，劳动互助使水翻了山。”河北省大名县劳动模范裴星辰在去年春天组织了有九十八户参加的信贷合作社，凑集了资金粮两万斤。在打井运动中，他们把信贷社改成打井互助社，打井时没有砖，就发动大家向亲友借。这样，全村共打了十八眼井，锥了十七眼井，修理了三眼旧井。平原省辉县山区老庄村，过去天旱时，人们做饭都要到八里路以外的山泉去挑水。但在抗旱模范牛汝卿的领导下，组织群众挖了十四个水窖，蓄存夏秋两季的雨水，不但解决了吃水的困难，并战胜了旱灾，得到了丰收，使穷村变成富村。
    二、合理用水，充分发挥水的灌溉效能，并能节省大批的劳力和资金。山西省崞县阳武河系附近的农民群众，由于组织了浇地互助组，今年春天浇地十一万亩，超过原计划三万亩。并且比往年节省四万三千个工。单干农民一眼井一般只能浇十几亩地，组织起来管理好了的水井，每眼能浇二十亩到五十亩。河北省博野县和蠡县好些村庄的互助组，采用接井和垫井台的办法，昼夜轮浇。有的井竟浇到一百四十多亩，使一眼井发挥三四眼井的效率。
    在开展防旱、抗旱运动中，怎样才能很快地把群众组织起来呢？各地有以下几点主要经验：
    一、加强爱国丰产的政治教育，贯彻兴修水利的奖励政策，是发动群众组织起来开展防旱、抗旱的最好方法。防旱抗旱是一项极艰巨的工作。因此，除应充分进行思想动员，打破农民“靠天等雨”的保守思想，坚定“人定胜天”的信念外，主要的是加强爱国丰产教育和贯彻兴修水利的奖励政策，使农民们深刻地认识到防旱、抗旱工作，不只是为自己多打粮食，也是为国家增强国防和经济建设的力量。而贯彻兴修水利的奖励政策，更能鼓舞和提高农民兴修水利的热情。去年河北省宁晋县高庄村在开展打井运动时，宣传了爱国丰产的伟大政治意义，解释了政府对私人投资兴修水利五年不增加负担的奖励政策，农民们的爱国热情和生产热情迅速地提高了。许多农民自找对象，合伙打井，几天的工夫，就有一百五十三户打了三十七眼井。蠡县林堡村在去年抗旱播种和保苗运动中，县区抗旱工作组对农民进行宣传动员，号召有井户自动让地邻使水，扩大浇地面积；说明帮助地邻浇地，增加生产，就是给国家增加了力量，也就是爱国的具体表现。结果，全村农民的政治觉悟大大提高，有井户主动地找地邻互助浇地，使全村八十五眼水井，由过去每眼平均浇地二十四亩，扩大到七十亩。全村增产籽棉（该村土地大部种棉）十万二千多斤。
    二、发动党员、团员、劳动模范和积极分子带头组织互助组，用“互助比单干强”的实际例子教育群众，是引导广大群众组织起来最有效的方式。绥远省凉城县劳动模范高海涛，解放后响应政府增加生产的号召，组织群众开渠。三年来共开干渠三道、支渠十九道，全长七十里，能浇地二万七千多亩。在他的宣传鼓动下，去年掀起全县各村组织起来开渠的竞赛运动，结果，共完成干支渠长约三百多里，增加灌溉面积十万零一千五百亩。山西长治工矿区宋家庄由劳动模范郭全德领导的互助组，去年冬天带头打井，并向全村挑战，掀起全村组织起来打井竞赛运动，一冬天打井一百眼，增加水车二十五辆。此外，不少地区用回忆旱灾的痛苦，宣传旱地和水浇地产量的对比，计算兴修水利的增产数量和赚回成本的时期的算细账方式，使农民深刻认识兴修水利的好处，很快地就把许多农民组织起来。平原省金乡县劳动模范侯执圭奔走各村，拿他自己的实际例子：打井贷水车得到丰收，三年来盖了新房子，添了牲畜、农具，生活走向富裕，向群众宣传打井贷水车的好处。他说：“每眼井浇地二十五亩，每亩一年两季可增产一百四十斤，二十五亩共增产三千五百斤，不但赚了水车，还可买条牛。”他这种算细账的方式，推动群众组织起来，打井一百零四眼，贷到水车一百六十辆。
    三、针对各地的具体情况，解决群众对组织起来兴修水利的思想顾虑和困难，是发展和巩固互助组织，开展防旱抗旱运动的主要关键。解放以后，农民迫切要求增加生产，战胜旱灾。问题是：一方面多数个体农民没有向旱灾作斗争的力量；另一方面他们对组织起来兴修水利，还有各种不同的思想顾虑。领导方面如能针对这些具体情况，替他们解决这些问题，就不难引导群众组织起来，向旱灾作斗争。平原省温县劳动模范任辰生，去年针对群众怕打井花钱（过去打井有大吃大喝的习惯），怕伤人命（沙土易塌，群众有“宁遭万年旱，不遭人命险”的说法），怕伙打井日后出纠纷等顾虑，提出节约、学打井技术、伙打井订合同的办法，带头打了一眼井，发动了全区组织起来打井的运动。每打完一眼井，群众都高兴地说：“又添了一个聚宝盆。”结果，全区共打了一百七十三眼井。
    在发动水车、水井互助时，必须遵守自愿、互利的原则，只有这样才能使互助巩固下去。平原省约有二千个互助组订立了打井（或用井）合同和浇地公约，保证井权、水权，不但巩固了互助组，也扩大了浇地面积。
    四、加强经济上的支持和技术上的指导，是发展互助扩大农田水利建设的重要因素。解放以后，人民政府对于农民的农田水利建设，曾予以大力支持，如发放贷款，扶植砖窑，各地合作社供应大量打井器材等等。在技术指导方面，不少地区组织了打井队和技术人员下乡，指导并帮助农民开渠、打井、修塘。这些措施发挥了推动农民组织起来兴修水利的作用。平原省一九五一年共打井一万二千眼，组织起来伙打的约占百分之六十。贷水车一万六千辆，伙贷的占百分之八十以上。不少水利重点村群众，对打井贷水车的好处已有了充分的认识。他们说：“一年赚水车，二年买头牛，三年四年好处多，爱国发家盖瓦屋。”山东桓台县水利灌溉的耕地已达百分之七十，农民中流传着“水车井，鸳鸯罐（一种灌溉的工具），不用老天也吃饭”的歌谣。益临县的农民也唱着这样的歌：“老天爷，你白看，大旱三年，我也能吃白面。”
    目前还有不少地区，没有通过水利贷款和技术指导把群众组织起来。据平原省汤阴县调查，去年贷款支持农民打了七百多眼井，就有五百眼是农民单打的，形成“不管浇地多少，打井的就贷款”的现象。各地的水井水源大都不足，去年河北省保定、定县、石家庄等专区，在抗旱播种时，把吃水用的井里的水都用完了。因此在技术上，须大力推广锥井，以增加水源，扩大浇地面积，巩固互助组织。
