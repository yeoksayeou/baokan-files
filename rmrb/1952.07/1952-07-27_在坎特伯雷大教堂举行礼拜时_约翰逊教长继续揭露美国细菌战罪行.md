Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 26th (Delayed Dispatch from London): Despite the vicious smear campaign by the British press, Dean Johnson of Canterbury continues to expose the germ warfare waged by the US aggressors against Korea and China.

On the evening of the 20th, Dean Johnson personally presided over the service at Canterbury Cathedral. The number of people attending the service was unprecedented for a Sunday service at Canterbury Cathedral in many years.

From the pulpit, Dean Johnson quoted the declaration of Chinese Christian leaders against germ warfare, once again calling on the British people to rise up and demand an end to this murder, and condemning the crimes committed by the US aggressors.

In his sermon, the Dean pointed out that the newspapers refused to publish his talk about the US use of bacteriological weapons, while in fact, these were words from the Eastern Church to the Western Church, evidence presented by the Eastern Church, not evidence he himself had put forward.

Dean Johnson said that the smear campaign by the British press "shows that the British people loathe germ warfare." He believed that the fact that the British press had to change its past policy of blocking news and carry out this smear campaign precisely made the British people see the terrible reality of germ warfare. He said: "The British press says: 'The Americans would not do such a thing.

The United Nations would not do such a thing. We cannot be partners in germ warfare.' I heartily thank God: the newspapers have inadvertently done the work of saving the Chinese people from the threat of germ warfare."

Dean Johnson also spoke about the glorious achievements of New China. Mrs. Johnson also attended the sermon.

    在坎特伯雷大教堂举行礼拜时
    约翰逊教长继续揭露美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】伦敦迟到消息：坎特伯雷教长约翰逊不顾英国新闻界的恶毒的污蔑运动，仍然继续进行揭发美国侵略者对朝鲜与中国进行细菌战的工作。
    二十日晚间，约翰逊教长亲自在坎特伯雷大教堂主持礼拜。参加礼拜的人数之多，为多年以来坎特伯雷大教堂举行星期礼拜时所未有。
    约翰逊教长在讲坛上引述中国基督教领袖们反对细菌战的宣言，再一次呼吁英国人民起来要求终止这种谋杀，并谴责美国侵略者所犯下的罪行。
    教长在讲道中指出：各报拒绝发表他关于美国使用细菌武器的谈话，而实际上这是东方教会向西方教会说的话，这些证据是东方教会所提出的证据，不是他自己提出的证据。
    约翰逊教长说：英国新闻界的污蔑运动“显示出英国人民厌恶细菌战”。他认为英国新闻界不得不改变过去封锁新闻的方针而进行这种污蔑运动，恰好使英国人民看到了细菌战的可怕的现实。他说：“英国新闻界说：‘美国人不会做出那样的事情来。
    联合国不会做出那样的事来。我们不可能是细菌战中的伙伴。’我衷心感谢上帝：报纸已在无意中做了把中国人民从细菌战的威胁中拯救出来的工作。”
    约翰逊教长还讲到了新中国的各项辉煌成就。约翰逊夫人也出席了这次讲道会。
