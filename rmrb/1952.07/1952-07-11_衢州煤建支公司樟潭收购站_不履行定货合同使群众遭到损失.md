To the Editor:

The Quzhou County Cooperative Bamboo Ware Production Group signed a bamboo curtain order contract with the Zhangtan Purchasing Station of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company's Quzhou Branch. The contract stipulated the specifications, prices, quality, delivery procedures, etc., and also specified that the delivery period would be from March 22nd to the end of May. It also stated that the relevant parties would be fully responsible if the goods were not delivered or received on time. In order to strictly abide by the contract, the Bamboo Ware Production Group mobilized all members to process and rush production. This batch of bamboo curtains was completed on May 16th, and the Zhangtan Purchasing Station was notified to bring payment and collect the goods. However, they went there for ten consecutive days (more than twenty times), and as of June 22nd, the goods had not been fully picked up. When the Bamboo Ware Production Group sent a representative to negotiate with the purchasing station, a Comrade Wang from the purchasing station said unreasonably: "I don't care about this (referring to the bamboo curtains). You must take good care of them, and you are responsible if they are damaged!" The Bamboo Ware Production Group had no choice but to suspend work for more than ten days and pile the bamboo curtains in the workshop. The failure of the Zhangtan Purchasing Station to fulfill the contract not only caused losses to the Bamboo Ware Production Group, but also led to the loss of approximately 30 million yuan in people's property when 100 logs tied to the creek by the station were washed away by the flood on the night of May 31st due to the station's lack of bamboo curtains. The above situation shows that the bureaucratism of the Zhangtan Purchasing Station is extremely serious. It is hoped that relevant departments will conduct inspection and deal with it.

    衢州煤建支公司樟潭收购站
    不履行定货合同使群众遭到损失
    编辑同志：衢州县合作社篾业生产组，和中国煤业建筑器材公司衢州支公司樟潭收购站曾签订一项篾莲定货合同，合同中除规定了规格、价格、质量、交货手续等外，还规定了自三月二十二日起到五月底止为交货日期，如不按期交收，有关方面应负完全责任。篾业生产组为了严格遵守合同，曾动员全体组员加工赶制。这批篾莲于五月十六日全部完成后，即通知樟潭收购站携款取货，但一连跑了十天（二十多次），直到六月二十二日还没有全部提清。篾业生产组派代表去向该收购站交涉时，收购站的王同志竟毫不讲理地说：“这我不管（指篾莲），你们一定要将它保管好，坏了你们负责！”篾业生产组没办法，只好停工十多天把篾莲堆在工场。樟潭收购站不履行合同，不但使篾业生产组受到损失，而且由于该站缺乏篾莲以至五月三十一日晚上，该站吊在溪里的一百根木头，被洪水冲去，使人民财产损失约三千万元。以上情况，说明樟潭收购站的官僚主义是极端严重的，希望有关部门进行检查处理。凌济忠
