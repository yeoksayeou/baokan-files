    To commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party
    Telegram of Congratulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    [By this newspaper] July 15 marks the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a telegram of congratulations. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party:
    On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, we extend warm congratulations to all members of the heroic Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people.
    Japanese imperialism once launched wars of aggression against China and the Pacific, causing enormous damage to the Chinese people and the people of the Pacific region, and also bringing great disasters to the Japanese people. Now, American imperialism continues to occupy Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and attempt to once again transform Japan into a hotbed of new wars. This brings a new threat of war to the Chinese people and the people of the Asia-Pacific region, and will also bring new disasters to the Japanese people.
    The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the Japanese people who are suffering under foreign occupation and the oppression of a reactionary government. The Chinese people hope that Japan will become an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous country, and hope that the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples will become that of peaceful coexistence, equal cooperation, mutually beneficial trade, and mutually respecting neighbors.
    We wish the Japanese people victory in their struggle against foreign occupation and for national independence. We wish the Japanese people victory in their struggle against reactionary rule and for the people's democratic freedom. We wish the Japanese people victory in their struggle for peace in Asia and against the threat of war.
    We wish the Japanese Communist Party, under the correct leadership of its Central Committee and its leader Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda, greater success in uniting the Japanese people, organizing a national liberation democratic united front to strive for national independence, democratic peace.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, July 10, 1952

    日本共产党成立三十周年纪念
    中国共产党中央委员会致电祝贺
    【本报讯】七月十五日是日本共产党成立三十周年纪念日，中国共产党中央委员会特致电祝贺。电文如下：日本共产党中央委员会：
    在日本共产党成立三十周年的时候，我们谨向英勇奋斗的日本共产党全体党员和日本人民致热烈的祝贺。
    日本帝国主义曾经发动过侵略中国和太平洋的战争，给中国人民和太平洋区域的人民以莫大的损害，同时也给了日本人民以很大的灾难。现在美帝国主义继续占领日本，复活日本军国主义，企图再一次变日本为新的战争的温床，这给中国人民和亚洲太平洋区域人民带来了新的战争的威胁，这也将给日本人民带来新的灾难。
    中国人民对于在外国占领下在反动政府压迫下痛苦深重的日本人民寄予深切的同情。中国人民希望日本成为独立的民主的和平的繁荣的国家，并希望中日两国人民的关系成为和平相处、平等合作、互惠通商、彼此尊重的邻居的关系。
    我们祝日本人民在反对外国占领、争取民族独立的斗争中取得胜利。我们祝日本人民在反对反动统治、争取人民的民主自由的斗争中取得胜利。我们祝日本人民在争取亚洲和平、反对战争威胁的斗争中取得胜利。
    我们祝日本共产党在其中央委员会及其领袖德田球一同志的正确领导之下，在团结日本人民、组织民族解放民主统一战线以争取民族独立与民主和平的斗争中取得更大的成就。
    中国共产党中央委员会一九五二年七月十日
