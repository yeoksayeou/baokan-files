Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th dispatch: The special meeting of the World Peace Council discussed the second item on the agenda – “The Immediate Cessation of the Korean War” – at the afternoon of the 3rd and morning of the 4th. On the evening of the 3rd, the representatives attending the meeting watched a documentary film about the crimes of American imperialism in Korea.

    At the afternoon session on the 3rd, the meeting was chaired by the Polish representative, Infeld. The Chinese representative, Guo Moruo, gave a report on the "General Introduction to the Korean Question," which was warmly welcomed by those present.
    When Han Xueye, the representative of the heroic Korean people, appeared on the podium, the representatives responded with enthusiastic applause. Han Xueye's speech was a moving story of the heroic struggle of freedom-loving people against American interventionists. Han Xueye said that the angry protests of ordinary people around the world demanding that American imperialists stop their crimes in Korea had an immeasurable inspiring and motivating effect on the Korean people who were engaged in a just struggle. Han Xueye called on the American people to unite and wage a struggle against the forces of imperialist aggression for democracy, peace, and international friendship.
    At the afternoon session, the French representative, Fache, delivered a lengthy speech on the United States' bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. Professor Larsen of Denmark and Picasso of France also spoke on this issue.
    The special meeting continued on the evening of the 3rd, chaired by the French representative, Sayon. The first to speak was the famous Turkish poet, Hikmet. He reported on the struggle of Turkish peace advocates against the dispatch of Turkish troops to Korea. Hikmet said that peace advocates were conducting propaganda and strikes, and they were being brutally persecuted by the Turkish authorities. More than 13,000 peace fighters have already been detained in prisons. The Turkish government's pro-American policy has caused the people to suffer severe sacrifices. Of the 18,000 soldiers Turkey sent to Korea, 12,000 have already been killed, wounded, or captured. Every day, newspapers report news of people being arrested for refusing to go to Korea, and of returning soldiers being arrested for "conducting malicious propaganda" (that is, telling the truth about American intervention). Hikmet emphasized that the Turkish people have never hated any war in history as much as they hate the Korean War.
    The famous Polish bacteriology professor, Hilszfeld, forcefully condemned the United States' crimes of bacteriological warfare against Korea and China. He emphasized that no scientist can stand idly by without participating in the struggle against the criminal bacteriological warfare.
    The Vietnamese representative, Yang Bai Lian, reported on the heroic struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the French and American colonialists for freedom and independence for the past seven years. He said that the Vietnamese people were learning about the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers with admiration. He concluded by shouting, "Long live the unity of the people of the world! Long live world peace!"
    The Canadian representative, Ms. Jennison, said that the majority of the Canadian people hoped for an early end to the Korean War.
    When Nikolai, the Metropolitan of Krutitsy and Kolomna of the Orthodox Church, took the podium, he was warmly welcomed by the representatives. Nikolai said that the Orthodox Church, together with all peace advocates, demands the cessation of preparations for a third world war. Peace advocates must use all possible means to demand an end to the expansion of armaments, to hold great power negotiations, to conclude just and comprehensive peace treaties with Germany and Japan, to end the Korean War, and to stop oppressing colonial peoples. In order to prevent new crimes, an appeal must first be made to the American people, because the American people bear moral responsibility for the actions taken by the American government. The people of all countries must cry out loudly to defeat the bloody conspiracies planned by evil people, just as the people of ancient Israel shook down the walls of Jericho with their voices, and to eliminate the crisis of catastrophe.
    On the morning of the 4th, the special meeting continued, chaired by the Czechoslovak representative, Mukarovsky.
    The British representative, Koski, said that throughout Britain, women are holding rallies and demonstrations under slogans such as "Immediate exchange of all prisoners of war" and "End the Korean War." Currently, British women are conducting a signature campaign for an appeal to the families of soldiers going to Korea. The appeal calls for an immediate end to the Korean War.
    Fang Shishan, representing the Chinese medical community, reported in detail on the situation of the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea and the methods they used. He called on all righteous people in the world to protest the despicable atrocities of the Americans in unison.
    The Finnish representative, Iverson, discussed the awkward role played by the United Nations in the Korean War. He said that the harmful resolution passed by the Security Council to use the United Nations flag to cover up the United States' actions in Korea must be repealed.
    The American representative, Kingsbury, spoke about his recent impressions of visiting China, saying that during this trip he realized that the great Chinese people were inspired by an unparalleled confidence in the future and in the victory of the cause of peace. Kingsbury emphasized that the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea are not only defending the interests of the Chinese and Korean people, but also defending the American people, helping them resist those who, for their own selfish interests, do not hesitate to destroy all the precious traditions of the United States. Kingsbury said that he would do everything in his power to publicize the facts of the United States' bacteriological warfare to the broad masses of the American people.
    The British representative, Crowther, said that the people of Western countries must play a huge role in the struggle for peace. Peace fighters must tirelessly expose the conspiracies of warmongers to the people of Western countries, and at the same time widely publicize the activities of outstanding leaders of the peace movement.
    The Colombian representative, Cuella, said: Colombia is also ashamed to have sent troops to Korea under the flag of the United Nations. But I can guarantee that the people of our country will never support the policies of American imperialism.
    The discussion of the second item on the agenda ended here.

    世界和平理事会特别会议
    讨论停止朝鲜战争问题
    郭沫若、韩雪野等一致痛斥美国侵朝罪行，主张立即结束朝鲜战争
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议在三日下午和四日上午的会议上讨论了第二项议程——“立即停止朝鲜战争”。三日晚参加会议的代表们看了关于美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行的纪录影片。
    三日下午会议开会时，由波兰代表英费尔德担任主席。中国代表郭沫若作了关于“朝鲜问题的一般导言”的报告，受到出席人士的热烈欢迎。
    英勇的朝鲜人民的代表韩雪野在讲台上出现时，代表们报以热烈的掌声。韩雪野的演说是爱好自由的人民反对美国干涉者的英勇斗争的动人故事。韩雪野说：全世界普通人民要求美帝国主义者停止他们在朝鲜的罪行的愤怒抗议，对正从事正义斗争的朝鲜人民发生了无限的鼓舞和激励作用。韩雪野要求美国人民团结起来，为民主、和平和国际友谊而进行反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争。
    在下午会议上，法国代表法奇发表了关于美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的长篇演说。丹麦的拉森教授和法国的毕加也就这个问题发表了演说。
    特别会议在三日晚继续开会，由法国代表赛扬担任主席。首先发言的是土耳其著名诗人希克梅特。他报告了土耳其和平拥护者反对派遣土耳其军队赴朝鲜的斗争情况。希克梅特说：和平拥护者进行宣传和罢工，他们受到土耳其当权者的残暴的迫害，现在已经有一万三千多和平战士被拘禁在监狱中。土耳其政府的亲美政策，使人民遭受了严重的牺牲。土耳其派往朝鲜的一万八千名兵士中，已经有
    一万二千名被击毙、击伤或俘获了。报纸上天天都有人民因拒绝到朝鲜去而被捕的消息，和回国的士兵因“进行恶意宣传”（就是说出美国干涉行动的真相）而被捕的消息。希克梅特强调指出：土耳其人民对于历史上任何一次战争的憎恶都没有像他们对于朝鲜战争的憎恶那么深。
    波兰著名细菌学教授希尔斯兹费尔德有力地谴责了美国对朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。他着重说：任何科学家都不能袖手旁观而不参加反对罪恶的细菌战的斗争。
    越南代表杨白莲报告了英勇的越南人民七年来为争取自由和独立向法、美殖民主义者进行英勇斗争的情况。他说：越南人民是以钦慕的心情学习朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争的。他最后高呼：“世界人民团结万岁！世界和平万岁！”
    加拿大代表詹尼逊女士说：加拿大大多数人民都希望朝鲜战争早日结束。
    东正教克卢提柴和科罗姆纳教区大主教尼古拉走上讲台时，受到代表们的热烈欢迎。尼古拉说：东正教和一切和平拥护者一道，要求停止准备第三次世界大战。和平拥护者必须使用一切可能的方法，要求停止扩张军备，举行大国谈判、缔结公正的全面对德对日和约，停止朝鲜战争和停止压迫殖民地人民。为了防止新的罪行，首先必须向美国人民发出呼吁，因为美国人民负有美国政府所采取的行动的道义责任。世界各国人民必须大声疾呼，使罪恶的人们所策划的血腥阴谋归于失败，正像古代以色列人用呼声震倒耶利哥城墙一样，使浩劫的危机消除。
    四日上午，特别会议继续开会，由捷克斯洛伐克代表穆卡罗夫斯基任主席。
    英国代表科斯基发言说：在英国各地，妇女都在“立即交换全体战俘”、“结束朝鲜战争”等口号下，举行集会和示威。目前，英国妇女正在开展向赴朝士兵家属呼吁书的签名运动。呼吁书要求立即结束朝鲜战争。
    方石珊代表中国医药界详细报告了美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的情况及他们所用方法。他号召全世界一切正义的人们同声抗议美国人的卑鄙暴行。
    芬兰代表伊维尔逊论述了联合国在朝鲜战争中所扮演的尴尬角色。他说，安理会所通过的用联合国旗帜来掩饰美国在朝鲜的行动的有害决议，必须取消。
    美国代表金斯伯利谈到他最近访问中国的印象说：在这次旅行中认识到了对未来和对和平事业胜利的无比信心在鼓舞着伟大的中国人民。金斯伯利强调指出：赴朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军不仅在保卫中朝人民的利益，而且在保卫美国人民，帮助他们抵抗那些为了自私的利益不惜破坏美国一切宝贵传统的人们。金斯伯利说，他要尽一切力量向美国广大人民宣传美国进行细菌战的事实。
    英国代表克劳瑟说：西方各国人民必须在争取和平的斗争中发挥巨大作用。和平战士必须向西方各国人民不倦地揭发战争贩子的阴谋，同时广泛宣传和平运动的杰出领袖的活动。
    哥伦比亚代表库艾拉说：哥伦比亚也在联合国旗帜下派遣军队到朝鲜去，我们深以为耻。但我可以保证，我国人民决不支持美帝国主义的政策。
    第二项议程的讨论至此结束。
