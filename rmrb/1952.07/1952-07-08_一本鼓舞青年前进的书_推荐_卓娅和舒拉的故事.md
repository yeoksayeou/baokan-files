    A Book that Inspires Youth to Move Forward
　　——Recommendation of "The Story of Zoya and Shura"
    Yuan Shuipai
    Written by Soviet Kosmodemyanskaya, translated by Mei Xun, published by China Youth Publishing House

    In many middle schools in Beijing [Note], entire grades and classes of students are competing to read, discuss, and praise this book. They copy the sentences that move them the most into their diaries and onto their pencil cases; they select those heart-stirring chapters and recite them like poems; or they adapt them into plays for performance. Young men and women are immersed in the beautiful and lofty thoughts and emotions described in this book. Teachers, class advisors, Communist Youth League cadres, and Young Pioneers instructors are using it as their own work manual. "The Story of Zoya and Shura," a biographical literary work with tremendous influence, is having an immeasurable impact on our youth. This is a simple book, but also an important one. It inspires youth and calls upon them to move forward!

    It has changed their attitude towards learning. Those who were previously careless are now serious. When Zoya did algebra exercises, she preferred to stay up late, insisted on overcoming difficulties, and never relied on ready-made answers. They reflected on their usual practice of checking answers or copying classmates' notebooks when doing exercises, which resulted in a large discrepancy between their exam scores and their usual performance. Now, seeing Zoya's spirit of hard work, they are determined to correct themselves. If Zoya had not finished her homework, she would restrain herself from reading her favorite novel, even if it was right at hand. They also learn her strict and rational approach to managing her time.

    This book has changed their attitude of underestimating labor and physical education. Previously, they were unwilling to be on duty, making their class the dirtiest in the school. Now, seeing Shura's dissatisfaction with a female classmate who didn't like to work, saying she was like a noble lady, they realized the two different class attitudes towards labor. They began to love labor, and the dirtiest class in the school became the cleanest. Some students who performed very well at school originally wouldn't lift a finger at home and would even throw tantrums. Now, seeing Zoya and Shura helping their mother with housework, they have also changed their past habits. They saw Zoya, unafraid of difficulties, practicing "White Stick" tricks, and Shura diligently practicing swimming, even in the cold season, so they began to pay attention to sports activities and no longer looked down on jump rope and parallel bars. They now all say: "We exercise to build our bodies for the motherland." Those who used to bury themselves in books, not love sports, and were physically weak, have now changed their attitude and joined various sports and recreational activities, and their bodies have gradually become healthier.

    Some people are selfish in their studies, working hard only for themselves and not helping their classmates. But what about Zoya? Almost all of her classmates had received her help, and she was unhappy when her classmates didn't score well on exams. Therefore, they should also help each other and care about others. However, Zoya firmly refused to give answers to classmates during exams. Therefore, they also don't.

    Some people don't like to study and read newspapers in class, but are quick to pick on others' shortcomings. But what about Zoya? She strictly requires others, but also strictly requires herself. Therefore, they also strictly require themselves.

    Some people only pay lip service to "serving the people," but refuse to participate in social activities. Then read about how Zoya never broke her promise to teach a literacy class to an illiterate old lady every Thursday!

    Zoya is upright, Zoya is just, Zoya distinguishes right from wrong, Zoya is brave, Zoya loves her country, and she also loves humanity. Zoya firmly believes in the truth and puts her beliefs into practice... All these beautiful qualities have become the goals pursued by the students.

    They are still students now, and they are determined to start with small things. Under the education of the school and the organization, they will train themselves and become outstanding children like Zoya, Shura, and our own Chinese young female hero, Liu Hulan.

    This book has over two hundred and seventy pages. Every page is permeated with the deep love of a mother, who is also a patriot and a revolutionary, for her children and her people. Every page shines with the noble spirit and communist morality of the Soviet people. The last third of the book describes Zoya and Shura's heroic deeds in defending their motherland, which both excites and inspires readers. The first two-thirds of the book depicts their lovely personalities and exemplary behavior during their childhood, as well as the family and social environment, historical traditions, and culture and art that shaped them, all of which evoke infinite admiration and love from the students. Every page is worth reading repeatedly. Every aspect of the beautiful personality cultivated and created by socialist society is worth observing and pondering. Kalinin said in his article "On the Moral Character of Our People" (载 “论共产主义教育” - included in "On Communist Education") that Zoya reached the highest level of patriotism and great virtue. She seemed to have absorbed all the excellent feelings and qualities that the Russian nation had cultivated in its historical development. Kalinin's high evaluation is enough to convince readers that they can learn from the hero in many ways.

    Here, I would only like to introduce one of the main characteristics of Zoya's character to the readers, which is that she is strict with others and also strict with herself. In her mother's words, she measures everything, her own and others' thoughts and actions, with the highest standards. Courage is reckless; friendship is selfless; loyalty is unconditional; happiness belongs to all the people, not to a narrow, one-room, personal happiness. This highest standard is also summarized in a famous saying by Ostrovsky, which Zoya wrote in her diary as a motto and later engraved on her marble tombstone: "The most precious thing in life is life. This life is given to man only once. A man's life should be spent in such a way that when he recalls the past, he will not suffer remorse for wasting his years... and when he is dying, he can say: all my life and energy have been devoted to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the liberation of mankind." Zoya's short life and her death have proven that she can withstand the measure of such a standard.

    She always spoke the truth frankly to her classmates, upheld justice, criticized what should be criticized, opposed what should be opposed, and thought seriously and independently about everything: What is good and what is bad? What is noble and dignified, and what is base and despicable? What is true friendship, loyalty, and justice? After her own exploration, she insisted on what she believed was correct. She opposed classmates lying, cheating, and not working; she opposed neighbor children teasing and bullying small animals; she could not agree with her classmates to love someone she did not respect; she was unhappy that she got a perfect score on her chemistry exam that she shouldn't have, even Shura thought she was "too serious"; she was late returning home to help her classmates study, and her mother waited anxiously, casually saying "please don't waste time in school uselessly in the future," which caused her to refute the word "uselessly" - not even yielding to her mother.... But she did not become isolated among her classmates because of this. Her character and sincere love for her classmates made all the classmates love and respect her.

    She measured herself with the highest standards, correctly regarded the interests of the masses as higher than everything else, far exceeding personal interests. She completely melted her body and mind into the collective.

    She measured herself with the highest standards, correctly and honestly fulfilled her obligations, and used all her strength and spirit to carry out every task assigned to her, regarding her work as part of the great common task that Lenin spoke of.

    She measured herself with the highest standards. She always felt that she was working too little for the motherland and for mankind. As soon as the war broke out, she was distressed that she could not contribute her strength to the country, and only felt a little comforted after working with her mother to sew military uniform buttons. She and her mother could have retreated to the rear, and friends had advised them more than once, but they did not do so. And they were not satisfied with the work of sewing military uniforms. Zoya and Shura went together to become lathe apprentices. Then she participated in the work of harvesting potatoes on state-owned farms. Although this was also serving on the labor front of the motherland, she still felt that she was working too little. Finally, she reached the forefront of the war and joined the guerrillas. Even in the guerrillas, she still felt that every task she completed was not enough, and she asked her superiors to assign more tasks... Advancing in this way, and then advancing, strictly and strictly demanding herself, until the last drop of blood was shed for the cause of human liberation!

    After Zoya started reading Chernyshevsky's works at school, she took the life of this great Russian scholar and revolutionary as the highest standard for measuring her own thoughts and actions. She selflessly immersed herself in Chernyshevsky's lofty thoughts: "For the victory of my beliefs, for freedom, equality, friendship, and happiness, for the elimination of poverty and crime, I will not spare my life! Assuming I am convinced that my beliefs are just and must triumph, then I do not regret that I cannot see their victory and realization. As long as I am convinced of this, I can die for it and feel sweet and not distressed."

    Zoya and Shura are outstanding youths in the Soviet Union, but they are by no means the only ones. In this Great Patriotic War, a total of 10,942 soldiers were awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" in the Soviet army, of which 7,000 were young people. Names familiar to Chinese youth include Matrosov and Oleg Koshevoy of the "Young Guard" in the Krasnodon mines.

    The emergence of these brilliant young role models is inseparable from the great revolutionary historical traditions of Russia, the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the superior social system of the Soviet Union, the good family education under this system, and the huge influence of Russian literature and art with a profound humanitarian spirit.

    The author used sincere, moving, detailed, and concise strokes to describe many important things that her children experienced in the process of growing up and the impact these things had on them. She described what kind of family they were born into, the thoughts and actions of their parents, the important family education they carried out for their children, the style of their grandparents and their influence, and even wrote about the respectable demeanor of the teachers who taught the author herself when she was young. As for the education that the children themselves received in schools, Young Pioneers, and Communist Youth League, it goes without saying that it occupies a lot of space in the book. The events that happened in the Soviet state left an indelible impression on the minds of the teenagers: seven Communist Party members in their hometown were beaten to death by rich peasants, the Arctic expedition of the icebreaker "Chelyuskin", the assassination of Kirov by the enemy, the construction achievements of the Moscow subway, the inventions and creations of national model workers and scientists in the Soviet Union, the flight of the aviator Chkalov across the North Pole, the Spanish Civil War... Like other Soviet people and Soviet youth, Zoya and Shura were wholeheartedly concerned about the Spanish revolution during this period. Zoya looked for news of the Spanish front in the newspaper every day after getting up, and donated money every day; Shura was even more determined to go to Madrid to fight. Then they were indignant at the fascist capture of Paris. They said that Paris was the Paris of the Paris Commune, and France was the France of Stendhal and Balzac... The author said well: "In the family, school, and children all experience the things that excite, worry, and cheer our country. Everything that happens around us educates our children." "The education they receive is to love their motherland, and also to respect all other people and the beautiful things created by all nations on the earth. Everything that children see around them, everything that school teaches them, cultivates true humanitarianism and benevolence in their minds. Eager to build rather than destroy, to create rather than destroy."

    The great role of the Party and the leader in the upbringing of their children can be illustrated by the following example. Zoya's parents specially kept a copy of the "Pravda" published in 1924 containing Stalin's oath at the time of Lenin's death. At that time, Zoya was just born, and they kept this newspaper not only to show that they would always remember the leader's words, but also to keep this newspaper for their daughter to read when she grew up. Sure enough, when Zoya was fifteen years old, she reread the great speech on this brittle newspaper that had turned yellow. Since then, she has successively read many important reports by Comrade Stalin, and the thoughts in these reports have deeply penetrated her heart and consciousness. Zoya said: "Yes, I fully understand; yes, I have been able to truly analyze this matter, and I have felt that this is very clear and very kind to me."

    What should attract our attention is that, above all, literature, art, and history play a particularly important role in cultivating the thoughts and morals of young people. From the fairy tales and Greek myths told by the father in childhood, to the songs of the civil war heard with the mother at the club, to the stories of Chapayev and the legends of Lenin heard at the summer campfire, to the Russian paintings seen in the Tretyakov Gallery, all the way to the Russian and foreign works read when she was able to read literary books. Rich culture shapes Zoya's ideology. She reads: Zhukovsky, Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy, Chernyshevsky, Herzen, Nekrasov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Gorky, Chekhov... Goethe, Dickens, Byron, Moliere, Shakespeare, Cervantes... as well as Mayakovsky's poems, "How the Steel Was Tempered", Gaidar's novels, and the biography of Danya Solomakha in "Women in the Civil War," which are closer to the times...

    The hands of great thinkers shape the noble soul of a hero.

    Let us not ignore Kalinin's assessment of the function of literature and art: "Our morality is developed and promoted by the outstanding representatives of the people. This should be attributed to the advanced Russian intellectuals, to Russian literature and art. ... Russian literature influenced the Russian people, and it forced the whole world to admit the noble virtues of the Russian people." ("Kalinin: On the Moral Character of Our People")

    ×    ×    ×

    "The Story of Zoya and Shura" itself is also an outstanding literary work that cultivates the morality of young people.

    From this book, we will more intimately recognize the happiness and perfection of Soviet society and families, and the patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet people.

    Intelligent and upright young people, who originally grew up working for happiness, joy, and peace, gave up their beautiful lives, like flowers in full bloom, without hesitation and heroically, and practiced their beliefs.

    From this book, we will further strengthen our hatred for imperialist aggressors. After the German bandits invaded the border, Zoya once wailed: "What kind of land are they trampling on!" Today's American plague spreaders are also trampling on peaceful and happy land. Imperialists are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving mankind!

    From this book, we will be more convinced that peace, justice, and humanity will surely defeat the decadent and shameless fascist beasts who are at the end of their rope!

    From this book, our youth will find great strength to arm themselves!

    一本鼓舞青年前进的书
　　——推荐“卓娅和舒拉的故事”
    袁水拍
    苏联柯斯莫捷米扬斯卡亚著　　么洵译青年出版社出版
    在北京的好些中学校里〔注〕，整个级、整个班的同学，争先阅读着这本书，讨论着，赞美着。他们把书中最感动自己的字句抄在日记本里，铅笔匣上；他们挑选那些激动心灵的章节，当作诗一般来朗诵；或者改编做戏剧来演出。男女青年们沉醉在这本书所描述的优美崇高的思想情感里，教师、班主任、青年团干部、少年儿童队辅导员，把它当做自己的工作手册。“卓娅和舒拉的故事”这本具有巨大感化力的传记文学著作，正在我们的青年中间产生着难以估量的影响。这是一本朴素的书，也是一本重要的书，它使青年奋发，它呼唤和教导青年前进！
    它改变了他们的学习态度，原先马虎的，现在认真了。卓娅做代数习题，宁愿做到深夜，坚持克服困难，决不依赖现成答案。他们反省自己平时作习题，常常翻查答案或抄袭同学的本子，以致考试时的成绩跟平时成绩大为悬殊。现在看到了卓娅刻苦学习的精神，他们就决心改正。卓娅要是没有做完功课，虽是手边有自己最心爱的小说，也克制着自己不去看。他们也学习她的这种严格的合理支配自己时间的作风。
    这本书改变了他们轻视劳动、轻视体育的态度。原先他们不愿当值日，使自己这一班成为全校最脏的一班，现在看到舒拉不满意一个不好劳动的女同学，说她是贵族小姐，就认识了对待劳动的两种不同的阶级的态度，他们开始爱好劳动，全校最脏的一班变成了最清洁的一班。有些同学原先在学校里表现很好，一到家里，双手不动，还发脾气，现在看到卓娅、舒拉帮助母亲在家劳动，也改变了过去的习惯。他们看到卓娅不怕艰难，练习“白棍儿”戏，看到舒拉勤习游泳，直到寒冷的季节，也就开始重视体育活动，不再小看跳绳、双杠了。他们现在都这样说：“锻炼体格是为了祖国。”原先死捧书本，不爱运动，身体弱的，现在一变过去态度，加入了各种体育文娱活动，身体也逐渐变好了。
    有人学习很自私，一个人用功，不帮助同学。但是，卓娅怎样呢？差不多她的同班同学全得到过她的帮助，她为同学们考试得分不好而郁郁不乐。因此，他们也要互相帮助，也要关心旁人。然而正在考试的时候，卓娅却坚决不告诉同学答案。因此，他们也不。
    有人不爱学习，上课看报，却尽挑旁人缺点。但是，卓娅怎样呢？她严格要求旁人，同时也严格要求自己。因此，他们也严格要求自己。
    有人只会口头上叫唤“为人民服务”，却拒绝作社会活动。那么读一读卓娅怎样决不爽约，每星期四给一个文盲老太太上课的一节文字吧！
    卓娅耿直，卓娅公正，明辨是非，卓娅勇敢，卓娅爱国，也爱人类，卓娅坚信真理，并在实践当中贯彻自己的信仰……这一切美好的品德都成为同学们追求的目标。
    他们现在还在学生时代，决心从小的事情做起，在学校和组织的教育下，锻炼自己，使自己也成为卓娅、舒拉，以及我们中国自己的青年女英雄刘胡兰那样的优秀儿女。
    ×    ×    ×
    本书共二百七十余页，每一页浸透着一个母亲、同时也是一个爱国者、革命者的对自己子女和人民的深厚爱情，每一页闪耀着苏联人民的高尚精神和共产主义道德的光芒。本书后面三分之一的篇幅所写的卓娅和舒拉保卫祖国的英勇事迹，既使读者兴奋鼓舞，就是前面三分之二的篇幅所描写的他们幼年时期的可爱的性格和模范的行为，以及熏陶他们成人的家庭和社会环境、历史传统和文化艺术，也都使同学们发生无限钦慕敬爱的情感。每一页都值得反复阅读。社会主义社会所培养造就的美丽的人格的每一个侧面，都值得我们观察揣摩。加里宁在“论我国人民底道德面貌”一文（载“论共产主义教育”）中说，卓娅达到了爱国主义和伟大德性的最高水平。她好像吸收了俄罗斯民族在它的历史发展中所陶养起来的一切优良的情感和品质。加里宁所作的这样高度的评价足以使读者相信，他们可以从多方面向英雄学习。
    在这里，只想举出卓娅的品格的主要特征之一来介绍给读者，这特征是她对待旁人严格，同时对待自己也严格，用她母亲的话来说，也就是用最高的尺度来衡量一切，衡量自己和旁人的思想行为。勇敢，是不顾一切的；友爱，是忘我的；忠实，是无条件的；幸福，是全人民的，而不是狭小的，一室之内的，个人的幸福。这最高的尺度也总括在奥斯特洛夫斯基的一句名言里，这句话曾经被卓娅写在自己日记本里作为座右铭，后来也刻在她的坟墓的大理石墓碑上：“人生最宝贵的就是生命。这生命，人只能得到一次。人的一生应该这样来度过：当他回忆往事时，不致因为虚度年华而痛苦悔恨……临死的时候能够说：我的整个生命和精力，都已献给世界上最壮丽的事业——为人类的自由解放而作的斗争了。”卓娅的短短的生活以及她的死，都证明了她是经得起这样一把尺子的衡量的。
    她在同学当中永远直率地当面说真话，坚持正义，批评该批评的，反对该反对的，严肃地和独立地思考一切事物：什么是好，什么是坏？什么是崇高，尊贵，什么是卑鄙，下贱？什么是真正的友爱，忠实，公理？经过自己的探求以后，只要认为是正确的，她就坚持不让。她反对同学撒谎，作弊，不劳动；她反对邻家孩子作弄欺侮小动物；她不能同意她的同学去爱一个自己所不尊敬的人；她为了自己的化学考试得了不应该得的满分而不快，连舒拉都认为她“过于认真”；她为了帮助同学学习而迟回家，母亲等得心焦，随便说了一句“以后请你不要无益地在学校里耽误”，就引起了她对“无益”这个词儿的反驳——虽对母亲亦不让步……。但她并不因此而在同学中变得孤立，由于她的品德和对同学们的真诚友爱，使同学们全爱她，尊重她。
    她把最高的尺度衡量自己，正确地把群众的利益看得高于一切，远超过个人利益。她使自己的身心跟集体完全融化成一片。
    她把最高的尺度衡量自己，正确地诚实地履行自己的义务，把自己的一切力量和精神去执行交给她的每一任务，把自己的工作看成列宁所说的伟大的共同任务的一部分。
    她把最高的尺度衡量自己，她总是觉得自己为祖国、为人类工作得太少。战争一爆发，她就为不能贡献自己的力量给国家而苦闷，后来和母亲一起做了缝军服纽绊的工作，才稍稍得到了安慰。她和母亲原可以撤退到后方去，朋友们已不止一次劝过她们，她们却不这样做。而且并不以缝军服的工作为满足，卓娅和舒拉一起去当了旋床学徒。接着又参加了收割国营农场马铃薯的工作，虽则这也是在祖国的劳动战线上服务，但她还是觉得自己工作得太少。终于到了战争的最前线，加入了游击队。即使在游击队中，她对于每一次完成的任务也还是觉得不够，她请求上级分配更多任务……这样地前进，再前进，严格，再严格地要求自己，直到为人类解放事业流完最后一滴血为止！
    卓娅在学校里开始读到车尔尼雪夫斯基的著作后，就把这位伟大的俄国学者和革命家的生平作为衡量自己思想行为的最高尺度，她忘我地沉浸在车尔尼雪夫斯基的崇高的思想里：“为了自己的信念胜利，为了自由，平等，友好和快乐，为了消灭贫困和罪恶，我毫不吝惜生命！假定我确信我的信念是公正的，并且一定胜利，那么我并不以我不能看见它们的胜利和实现为憾事，只要我确信这个，我就能为此而死去，并觉得甜蜜而不苦恼。”
    卓娅和舒拉是苏联的杰出的青年，但决不是仅有的，在这次伟大卫国战争中，苏维埃军队中一共产生了一万零九百四十二个荣膺“苏联英雄”称号的战士，其中七千名是青年。为中国青年所熟知的名字，还有马特洛索夫和克拉斯诺顿矿区的“青年近卫军”奥列格·柯歇伏依等。
    这些光辉的青年楷模之所以产生，是和俄国的伟大革命历史传统、列宁—斯大林党的领导、苏联的优越的社会制度和这种制度下的良好的家庭教育以及俄国的具有深刻人道主义精神的文学艺术的巨大影响，分不开的。
    本书作者用真切动人的，细致的也是简洁的笔触，描绘了她的儿女在成长过程中所经历的许多重要的事情以及这些事情所给与他们的影响。她描写了他们出生在怎样的家庭里，他们父母的思想行为，他们对孩子们所进行的重要的家庭教育，他们祖父母的作风及其影响，甚至也写到了作者自己幼小时所受教的老师的可敬的风貌。至于孩子们自己在学校里、少先队里、青年团里所受的教育，更不用说占了书的不少篇幅了。苏联国家里所发生的一切事件更在少年们的心灵里留下不可磨灭的印象：家乡七个共产党员被富农打死，破冰船“赤留斯金”的北极探险，基洛夫的被敌人刺死，莫斯科地下铁道等等建设上的成就，苏联全国模范工人和科学家的发明创造，飞行家齐卡洛夫的飞越北极，西班牙的内战……卓娅和舒拉像别的苏联人民、苏联青年一样，在这时期内，全心地关怀着西班牙的革命，卓娅每天起床后就去找报纸上的西班牙前线战讯，每天捐钱；舒拉更一心想到马德里去作战。接着他们又为法西斯蒂攻陷巴黎而愤慨，他们说巴黎是巴黎公社的巴黎，法国是斯汤达尔和巴尔札克的法国……作者说得好：“在家庭、学校，儿童全体验着使我们全国兴奋、着急、欢欣的东西，周围发生着的一切事物都教育着我们的孩子。”“他们所受的教育，是叫他们热爱自己的祖国，同时也尊重所有其他的人民以及全地球上各民族所创造的美丽的东西。孩子们在自己的周围所看见的一切，学校所教给他们的一切，全在他们的脑子里培育着真正的人道主义，仁爱精神。热望着建设而不是破坏，创造而不是毁灭。”
    党和领袖对自己儿女的教养的伟大作用，只消举这样一个例子，就足以说明了。卓娅的父母曾把一九二四年载有列宁逝世时斯大林发表誓词的一份“真理报”特意收藏起来。那时卓娅出生才不久，他们保存这张报纸除了表示自己要永远记住领袖的话外，就是想把这份报纸保留给长大后的女儿来读。果真在卓娅十五岁的时候，她重读了这张颜色变黄了的焦脆的报纸上的伟大演说。从此以后，她陆续读了斯大林同志许多重要的报告，这些报告中的思想深深地渗透了她的心和意识。卓娅这样说：“是，我全了解；是，我已经能够真正地分析这事了，我已经觉出这对我很清楚，很亲切了。”
    应该引起我们着重注意的是：在一切之中，文学、艺术、历史在培育青年思想道德方面所起的特别重要的作用。从在儿童时期父亲所讲的童话和希腊神话起，以及跟着妈妈到俱乐部去听内战时期的歌子，以及在夏季营火会中所听到的夏伯阳的故事和列宁的传说，以及在特列佳柯夫画馆中所看到的俄国名画，一直到能够阅读文学书籍时所读到的俄国和外国的许多作品。丰富的文化陶冶着卓娅的思想意识，她阅读着：儒柯夫斯基、普希金、莱蒙托夫、托尔斯泰、车尔尼雪夫斯基、赫尔岑、涅克拉索夫、谢德林、高尔基、契诃夫……歌德、狄更斯、拜伦、莫里哀、莎士比亚、塞万提斯……以及时代更接近的马雅柯夫斯基的诗、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、盖达尔的小说、“国内战争中的女性”中丹娘·索罗玛哈的传记……
    伟大思想家的手塑造成英雄的高尚的灵魂。
    让我们不要忽视加里宁对文学艺术的功能的估价吧：“我们的道德是由人民底优秀代表来发展和宣传的。这点应当归功于俄国先进知识界，归功于俄国文学和艺术。……俄国文学感化了俄国人民，它迫使全世界都承认俄国人民的高尚德性。”（“加里宁：论我们人民底道德面貌”）
    ×    ×    ×
    “卓娅和舒拉的故事”本身也是一本杰出的培植青年道德的文学著作。
    从这本书里，我们将更加亲切地认识苏联社会、家庭的幸福美满，苏联人民的爱国主义、国际主义精神。
    聪明正直的青年们，原是为幸福、快乐和和平劳动而长大的，可是他们毫不吝惜地、英勇豪迈地交付了自己的像鲜花初放一样美丽的生命，实践了自己的信仰。
    从这本书里，我们将更加增强对帝国主义侵略者的仇恨心。在德寇侵入边境后，卓娅曾经痛呼：“他们践踏着什么样的土地呀！”今天的美国的瘟疫撒布者同样也在践踏着和平幸福的土地，帝国主义者是所有爱好和平人类的死敌！
    从这本书里，我们将更加坚信和平、正义和人道是一定会战胜穷途末路的堕落无耻的法西斯野兽的！
    从这本书里，我们的青年将找到巨大的力量来武装自己！
