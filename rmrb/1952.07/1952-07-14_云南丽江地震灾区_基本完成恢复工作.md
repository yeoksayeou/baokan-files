Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 13th: The 120,000 people of various ethnic groups in the earthquake-stricken area of Lijiang, Yunnan Province, who suffered in the major earthquake on December 21st of last year, have victoriously overcome the disaster, completed this year's spring plowing, summer harvest, and the first phase of house reconstruction plan. Many severely affected villages have basically returned to their pre-earthquake appearance.

The restoration and reconstruction work in the Lijiang earthquake zone began in mid-February after the end of the emergency relief work. The People's Government successively distributed 2.88 million jin of relief grain and agricultural production loans and house construction funds totaling 5.45 billion yuan. People of all ethnic groups in non-disaster areas also displayed the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, sending 189,000 pieces of clothing, hundreds of thousands of pieces of utensils such as pots and bowls, and a large amount of grain and timber to the disaster area. In addition, several thousand laborers were organized to go to the disaster area to help build houses. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in the disaster area quickly overcame the disasters caused by the earthquake. By mid-May, all the cracked river channels had been completely repaired. Jianchuan and Heqing counties alone mobilized nearly 150,000 laborers to repair six large river channels, which not only ensured the safety of more than 110,000 mu of paddy fields and more than 100 villages along the rivers, but also increased the irrigation of paddy fields by more than 15,000 mu. During the spring plowing season, the people of all ethnic groups in the disaster area carried out spring plowing and sowing while accumulating large amounts of fertilizer, so the amount of fertilizer applied to this year's rice paddies and cornfields increased compared to previous years. The people of all ethnic groups in the disaster area also built 78 ditches and 87 weirs and ponds, transforming more than 46,500 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Most wheat fields were also weeded once more and topdressed once more than in previous years, so the total wheat production in the disaster-stricken area this year increased by half to one tenth compared to previous years.

The disaster victims of all ethnic groups in the earthquake-stricken area have carried out the work of rebuilding houses in an organized and planned manner. After less than three months of hard work, all the houses damaged in the lightly affected villages have been completely repaired, and the severely affected villages have also repaired 30 to 60 percent of the houses destroyed by the earthquake. The people of all ethnic groups are determined to restore all the damage caused by the earthquake by the end of this year.

    云南丽江地震灾区
    基本完成恢复工作
    【新华社昆明十三日电】去年十二月二十一日云南省丽江大地震中受灾地区的十二万各族人民已胜利度过灾荒，完成了今年的春耕、夏收和第一期房屋重建计划。许多重灾村已经基本上恢复了地震前的面目。
    丽江地震区的恢复和重建工作，是从今年二月中旬急救工作结束之后开始的。人民政府先后发出了救济粮二百八十八万斤，农业生产贷款和房屋修建费共五十四亿五千万元。非灾区各族人民也发挥了友爱互助的精神，先后送给灾区人民十八万九千多件衣服，数十万件锅、碗等用具和大批的粮食、木料，此外又组织了几千个人工到灾区去帮助修建房屋。因此，灾区各族人民很快就战胜了地震所造成的灾害。到五月中旬为止，所有被震裂的河道，已全部整修完竣，单是剑川、鹤庆两县就动员了将近十五万个民工，修复了六条大河道，不但保证了沿河十一万多亩水田和一百多个村庄的安全，并且可以增灌水田一万五千多亩。在春耕时期，灾区各族人民一面进行春耕播种，一面积贮大量肥料，所以今年的稻田和苞谷地所施的肥料都比往年增加。灾区各族人民又兴修了七十八条水沟和八十七个堰塘，把四万六千五百多亩干地改造成为水田。大部分麦田也比往年多锄了一次草，多施了一次追肥，所以受灾地区今年的麦子总产量，反比往年增加了半成到一成。
    震灾区各族灾民有组织有计划地进行了重建房屋的工作，经过不到三个月的艰苦努力，所有轻灾村被震坏的房屋，已全部修补一新，重灾村也已修复了被震毁房屋的百分之三十到六十。各族人民决心在今年年底以前，把地震所造成的破坏全部恢复起来。
