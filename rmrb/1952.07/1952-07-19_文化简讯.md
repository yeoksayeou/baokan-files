    Hygiene work in ethnic minority areas of Southwest China is being strengthened daily.
    Hygiene work in ethnic minority areas of Southwest China is being strengthened daily.  Nearly 200 of the 238 counties in the Southwest region inhabited by ethnic minorities have established hygiene clinics, and some places have established health centers and people's hospitals. Counties in Guizhou, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan provinces and regions where ethnic minorities live in concentrated and mixed communities have all established hygiene clinics; all counties under the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, except Shiqu County, have hygiene clinics. While establishing health institutions in ethnic minority areas, governments at all levels in the Southwest, under the principle of "prevention first," have also organized many epidemic prevention teams and mobile medical teams to directly penetrate ethnic minority areas to treat and prevent diseases for people of all ethnic groups. Last year, the Southwest region organized a total of 26 mobile medical and epidemic prevention teams and two medical groups, which treated diseases and carried out prevention of various epidemics for tens of thousands of ethnic minority people. According to the epidemic situation in ethnic minority areas, the People's Government has set up many prevention and treatment centers and stations in various places this year, and sent working teams to work in various places. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has established a venereal disease prevention and treatment center. Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are also establishing four malaria prevention and treatment stations. The Southwest Health Department recently sent a malaria prevention and treatment team and a maternal and child health working team to work in Yunnan, which will assist Yunnan in establishing a malaria prevention and treatment institute and conduct research on malaria prevention and treatment. In addition, the department has allocated funds to Yunnan and Western Sichuan to establish venereal disease prevention and treatment teams in the Tibetan-populated areas of Lijiang Prefecture in Yunnan and Maoxian Prefecture in Western Sichuan.

    Medical teams sent by the People's Government to various places have overcome various difficulties and penetrated into remote areas to provide free treatment to ethnic minorities. In addition to sending a national health work team to work in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government also organized a grassland ethnic minority health work team, which arrived in the snow-capped grassland area of Songpan County in Western Sichuan in April this year to work, and was warmly welcomed by the local Tibetan people. Local medical teams have also helped various ethnic groups train a large number of health cadres in their work. Now, many ethnic minorities in the Southwest have their own primary health personnel and midwives.

    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to organize literacy learning for workers and peasants in the province.
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to organize literacy learning for workers and peasants in the province in stages starting in the second half of this year. The plan is to enable all illiterate or semi-literate workers and peasants in urban and rural areas to learn to read and read newspapers within two years. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all counties in the province to universally open rapid literacy classes in early October, and requires all counties to universally establish rapid literacy promotion committees headed by the secretary of the county party committee or the county head to effectively lead the rapid literacy work. At present, party committees at the prefectural, county, and municipal levels in the province have selected teachers to concentrate on studying the rapid literacy teaching method in Wuchang.

    The Xinjiang Military Region and Ningxia Military Region of the People's Liberation Army hold rapid literacy teacher training courses.
    In order to carry out the literacy campaign among soldiers, the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region and the Ningxia Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have been holding rapid literacy teacher training courses since mid-May. Eight Uyghur youths who have a slight understanding of Chinese also participated in the second phase of the teacher training course held by the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region. In 18 days of study, they have learned more than 800 Chinese characters.

    The People's Publishing House publishes the "Rapid Literacy Handbook"
    The People's Publishing House in Beijing recently published a "Rapid Literacy Handbook." This is a relatively complete book for rapid literacy teaching. It introduces the principles, teaching methods, and experiences of rapid literacy, and compiles a "Phonetic Alphabet Table," "Pinyin Tutorial," "Phonetic Vocabulary" and "Selected Readings" according to the teaching progress. The "Phonetic Vocabulary", which is used to intensively learn new words, has collected a total of 2,200 single characters, including the 1,500 characters in the "Commonly Used Characters List" recently announced by the Central Ministry of Education and all the new words in the "Workers' Literacy Textbook" and "Farmers' Literacy Textbook", and connects many single characters into "words". This vocabulary not only makes it easier for teachers to explain the meaning of the characters when intensively learning new words, but also makes it easier for students to associate and remember. People who learn these characters can generally understand popular books and newspapers.
