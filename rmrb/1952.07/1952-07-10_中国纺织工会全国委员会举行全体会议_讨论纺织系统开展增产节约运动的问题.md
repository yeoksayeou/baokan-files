Xinhua News Agency, July 9th:

    The All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee held its first Fourth Plenary Session from June 25th to July 3rd, focusing on discussing the issue of launching the increased production and conservation campaign in the textile system.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Chen Shaomin delivered a report on "A Summary of the Textile Workers' Union's Work in the Past Ten Months" and "Launching the Increased Production and Conservation Campaign to Welcome Large-Scale National Economic Construction." In her report, Chen Shaomin briefly explained the specific situation in the textile industry: on the one hand, under the leadership and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party, the class consciousness of Chinese textile workers has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Improving tools, improving operating methods, increasing production, and reducing costs have become the demands of the masses of workers in various departments of the textile industry, thus gradually increasing the level of textile production; but on the other hand, there are still some problems in the textile system, such as the supply of raw materials still having some difficulties, state-owned textile enterprises have not yet carried out comprehensive production reforms, and there are many weaknesses in factory management, which have caused some difficulties in factory management and continued improvement of production. Chen Shaomin pointed out that all these problems need to be gradually resolved in this increased production and conservation campaign.

    Based on Chen Shaomin's report and the specific situation in the textile industry, the meeting discussed and determined that the current focus of increased production and conservation in the textile system is: in state-owned factories, except for textile machinery manufacturing enterprises, generally, increased production and reduced costs should be achieved through saving raw materials, improving quality; and opposing the practice of blindly increasing output and neglecting quality. In private factories, trade union organizations should also, based on specific conditions, organize the masses to formulate plans and launch increased production and conservation campaigns; at the same time, labor-management contracts should be signed to prevent capitalists from implementing the "five poisons" again.

    The meeting conducted a detailed discussion on the issue of production reform within textile enterprises. Everyone agreed that some labor organizations in state-owned textile factories are unreasonable. In the past, production teams were organized separately according to the type of work, and because the various types of work were not related to each other, uncoordinated production phenomena often occurred. Some basic workers do auxiliary work, which cannot fully utilize the effectiveness of basic workers and hinders the improvement of labor productivity. To this end, the meeting decided that trade union organizations in various textile factories must first help the administration to improve the existing labor organization. Each production team should include various necessary types of work, so that they can jointly use certain machines, divide responsibilities, give play to the spirit of collectivism, and complete common production tasks; various labor organizations in the production process should be adjusted according to technical level, machinery and equipment, and other conditions to overcome the uncoordinated phenomena between various types of work and between front and back processes. In terms of production management, the shift handover system and production responsibility system must be effectively implemented, so that workers' jobs and machines remain relatively fixed, which is convenient for workers to become familiar with machines and master their work. Each factory should be equipped with a certain number of reserve workers to overcome the chaotic phenomenon caused by relying on temporary workers. Secondly, the trade union should help the administration to quickly revise the existing unreasonable quotas and production standards based on the technical level of the workers and based on reasonable and average advanced principles; adjust wages and formulate reasonable incentive systems to encourage workers to improve their skills and continue to improve operating methods. Trade union organizations at all levels of the textile industry must also help the administration to improve and establish management systems; and effectively organize workers to learn economic accounting and launch a mass small-group economic accounting campaign.

    The meeting believes that constantly paying attention to improving the labor conditions and welfare facilities of employees is an important condition for ensuring the smooth completion of the increased production and conservation tasks. The meeting criticized the bourgeois viewpoints that lowering the temperature in the workshop would affect production and "valuing machines over people," and emphasized that lowering the temperature and humidity in the workshop is not only beneficial to the health of employees, but also more conducive to the improvement of production. The meeting requested that trade union organizations at all levels of the textile industry must quickly assist the administration in improving workshop ventilation equipment and safety devices; universally establish employee sanatoriums; and improve the health conditions of female workers and pregnant women, so that they can contribute greater strength to national economic construction.

    The meeting believes that improving the political and ideological level and cultural and technical level of the masses of employees is an important task in preparing for large-scale economic construction. The meeting requested that trade union organizations at all levels of the textile industry must, under the leadership of the Party, conduct communist and communist party education to the broad masses of employees in a planned and regular manner, in order to improve the class consciousness of employees and enable them to actively participate in the management of state-owned enterprises. The trade union must attach importance to the education of technical personnel and management personnel, help them earnestly carry out ideological transformation, and overcome their capitalist viewpoints in technical guidance and business management methods. Each factory should vigorously promote the quick literacy method, guarantee study time, and strive to eliminate illiteracy among employees as soon as possible, according to the specific situation. The trade union should also actively organize workers to learn technology; try to help newly promoted worker cadres become familiar with their work; and continue to train a large number of worker cadres to meet the needs of national economic construction.

    The meeting also focused on discussing how grassroots trade unions should organize and lead the increased production and conservation campaign. The meeting believes that: grassroots organizations are the foundation of trade union organizations, and all resolutions of the trade union are realized through grassroots organizations, therefore, organizing and leading the competition movement should be the central task of trade union grassroots organizations. The meeting believes that: thoroughly and extensively promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method, giving full play to the creativity of workers, and continuing to summarize and promote various advanced experiences, and carrying out rationalization proposals are the main methods for organizing and leading the increased production and conservation competition. Trade union grassroots organizations must strengthen the political leadership and ideological leadership of the movement, so that the broad masses of employees can fully understand the important significance of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, and actively participate in this work. In summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, on the one hand, employees should be mobilized to fight against all conservative ideas; on the other hand, the bias of summarizing, promoting, and revising in a chaotic manner must be prevented. The leadership should promptly analyze, study, summarize, and respond to the rationalization proposals of the employees, regardless of their size. Once adopted, they should be promptly rewarded and promoted. The meeting believes that the team is the specific executor of production tasks and the grassroots organization of production. Therefore, the Hao Jianxiu team competition currently being carried out is the best way to carry out the increased production and conservation campaign. Trade union organizations at all levels of the textile industry should strengthen the leadership of the Hao Jianxiu team competition, so that the conditions of the competition meet the specific conditions and requirements of the textile industry. In organizing the competition, trade union grassroots organizations should mobilize the masses to formulate increased production and conservation plans and revise patriotic covenants; and cultivate one or several teams and workshops to create experience and establish production banners to drive other workshops and teams forward.

    At the end of the meeting, Chairman Chen Shaomin made a concluding report. She called on trade union organizations at all levels of the textile industry and textile workers across the country to actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, strive to complete the increased production and conservation plan, lay the foundation for the economic accounting system, and welcome the glorious task of large-scale national economic construction.

    中国纺织工会全国委员会举行全体会议
    讨论纺织系统开展增产节约运动的问题
    【新华社九日讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会于六月二十五日至七月三日举行首届四次全体会议，着重讨论了在纺织系统中开展增产节约运动的问题。
    会议开始由陈少敏主席作了“纺织工会十个月来工作概况”及“开展增产节约运动，迎接国家大规模经济建设”的报告。陈少敏在报告中扼要地说明了目前纺织工业中的具体情况：一方面，中国纺织工人在中国共产党的领导与培育下，阶级觉悟空前提高。改良工具、改进操作方法、提高生产、降低成本已成了纺织工业中各个部门职工群众的要求，因而使纺织生产的水平逐步上升；但另一方面，目前纺织系统中还存在一些问题，如原料材料的供应还有某些困难，国营纺织企业至今尚未进行全面的生产改革，工厂管理中存在着许多弱点，以致造成了工厂管理及继续提高生产中的一些困难。陈少敏指出：所有这些问题，都需要在这次增产节约运动中逐步解决。
    会议根据陈少敏的报告及纺织工业中的具体情况，讨论并确定了目前纺织系统增产节约的重点是：在国营工厂中，除纺织机械制造企业外，一般的应从节约原料、材料、提高质量中达到增加生产、降低成本；反对盲目提高产量，忽视质量的作法。在私营工厂中，工会组织也应根据具体情况，组织群众制定计划，开展增产节约运动；同时应通过签订劳资合同，防止资本家再施“五毒”。
    会议对纺织企业内部的生产改革问题，进行了详细的讨论。大家认为目前国营纺织厂中的某些劳动组织是不合理的。过去的生产小组按工种分别编组，由于各种工种互不相关，往往造成生产上的不协调现象。某些基本工人做辅助工作，不能充分发挥基本工人的效能，阻碍了劳动生产率的提高。为此，会议决定各个纺织厂的工会组织，必须首先帮助行政着手改善现有的劳动组织。每个生产小组中，应包括各种不同的必要的工种，使他们共同使用一定的机器，分工负责，发挥集体主义精神，完成共同的生产任务；生产过程中的各种劳动组织，都应按技术水平、机器设备等条件进行调整，克服各种工种之间以及前后工序生产不协调的现象。在生产管理方面，必须切实实施交接班制和生产负责制，使工人的工作岗位和机器保持相当的固定，以便于工人熟习机器和精通业务。各厂应配备一定数量的预备工人，以克服依靠临时工所造成的混乱现象。其次，工会应帮助行政根据工人的技术水平，根据合理的及平均先进的原则，迅速修正现有不合理的定额及生产标准；调整工资和制定合理的奖励制度，以鼓励工人提高技术、继续改进操作方法。纺织工会各级组织，还必须帮助行政健全和建立管理制度；切实组织工人学习经济核算，开展群众性的小组经济核算运动。
    会议认为经常注意改善职工的劳动条件和福利设施，是保证增产节约任务顺利完成的重要条件。会议批判了那种认为降低车间温度会影响生产及“重机器不重人”的资产阶级观点，着重指出降低车间的温度和湿度，不仅有益于职工健康，而且更有利于生产的提高。会议要求纺织工会各级组织，必须迅速地协助行政改善车间通风设备和安全装置；普遍举办职工业余休养所；改善女工与孕妇的卫生条件。使他们在国家经济建设中贡献更大的力量。
    会议认为提高职工群众的政治、思想水平和文化、技术水平，是做好大规模经济建设准备的重要任务。会议要求纺织工会各级组织，必须在党的领导下，有计划地经常地向广大职工进行共产主义与共产党的教育，以提高职工的阶级觉悟，使他们积极地参加国营企业的管理。工会必须重视技术人员、管理人员的教育工作，帮助他们认真进行思想改造，克服他们在技术指导和经营管理方法上的资本主义观点。各厂应根据具体情况，大力推广速成识字法，保证学习时间，争取早日消灭职工中的文盲。工会还应积极地组织工人学习技术；设法帮助新提拔的工人干部熟习自己的业务；并继续培养大批的工人干部，以适应国家经济建设的需要。
    会议还着重讨论了基层工会如何组织与领导增产节约运动的问题。会议认为：基层组织是工会组织的基础，工会的一切决议都是通过基层组织来实现的，因此，组织与领导竞赛运动应是工会基层组织的中心任务。会议认为：深入而广泛地推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，充分发挥工人的创造性，继续总结与推广各种先进经验，开展合理化建议，是目前组织与领导增产节约竞赛的主要方法。工会基层组织，必须加强对运动的政治领导和思想领导，使广大职工能充分地认识总结与推广先进经验的重要意义，并积极地参加这一工作。在总结与推广先进经验中，一方面应发动职工向一切保守思想做斗争；一方面还必须防止乱总结、乱推广、乱修改的偏向。领导方面对于职工群众的合理化建议，不分大小，都应及时加以分析研究、总结和答复。一经采纳，即应及时奖励和推广。会议认为小组是生产任务的具体执行者，是生产的基层组织。因此目前正在开展的郝建秀小组竞赛，是开展增产节约运动最好的方式。纺织工会各级组织应加强对郝建秀小组竞赛的领导，使竞赛的条件符合纺织工业的具体情况和要求。在组织竞赛中，工会基层组织应发动群众订立增产节约计划和修订爱国公约；并培养一个或几个小组和车间，创造经验，树立生产旗帜，以带动其他车间和小组前进。
    会议最后由陈少敏主席做总结报告。她号召纺织工会各级组织及全国纺织工人，积极响应毛主席的号召，为完成增产节约计划，打下经济核算制的基础，迎接国家大规模经济建设的光荣任务而奋斗。
