Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: Indian newspapers continue to condemn the recent provocative warmongering statements made by U.S. General Collins and others. According to the Press Trust of India: The "Hindustan Standard" published a commentary on the 21st, saying, "In the history of the tragic and cruel Korean War, whenever peace talks get closer to ending, some sudden and malicious events are always created."

The "Leader" newspaper, in a commentary on the 21st regarding the warmongering provocative statements of U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins, pointed out that this was an intimidation of China. The newspaper questioned, "At a delicate and critical juncture in the armistice negotiations, should a military man make such a rash and provocative statement?" The newspaper pointed out, "Collins' statement, in addition to usurping political authority, is also very inappropriate." The newspaper concluded, "It is regrettable that military men are broadcasting such provocative statements at a time when world peace is hanging by a thread."

    印度报纸斥柯林斯战争叫嚣
    【新华社二十三日讯】印度报纸舆论继续谴责美国将军柯林斯等人最近发表的挑拨性好战言论。据印度新闻处消息：“印度斯坦旗报”二十一日发表评论说：“在悲惨而残酷的朝鲜战争的历史上，每当和谈更加接近结束的时候，总有一些突然的恶毒的事件被制造出来。”
    “领导者”报二十一日在评论美国陆军参谋长柯林斯好战的挑拨性言论时，指出这是对中国的恫吓，该报责问道：“在停战谈判达到微妙的紧急关头时，一个军人是否应该发表这种轻率的挑衅性的声明？”该报指出：“柯林斯的声明除了僭夺政治职权外，还非常不合时宜。”该报最后说：“正当世界和平陷于千钧一发的时候，军人竟来广播这种挑拨性的声明，是很可痛心的。”
