Gao Yubao Writes a Book
(Based on Gao Yubao's article "How I Learned to Read and Write")
    Chen Xinghua, Painting
    I. I am from Sunjiatun Village, Taiping District, Pingshan Region, Fuxian County, Liaodong Province. My family was very poor and suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of enemy bandits, traitors, landlords, and local bullies. We didn't have money for me to go to school.
    II. I was very envious when I saw other people's children going to school, and I often begged my mother, "I want to go to school!" My mother wouldn't let me go because we didn't have money. Once, I got so angry that I ran to the school, and my mother chased after me. She caught up with me on the riverbank, and she held me and cried for a long time.
    III. One day, a dozen or so children and I went up the mountain to gather grass. We saw Mr. Zhou from the school leading a group of students on a trip. I gathered the dozen or so grass-gathering children together and imitated the students' marching, shouting "One, two, one." That Mr. Zhou said I was clever and was willing to introduce me to the school to study.

    高玉宝写书

    一、我是辽东省复县平山区太平村孙家屯人，家里很穷，受着敌寇、汉奸、地主、恶霸的残酷压迫和剥削，没有钱给我念书。
    二、我看见人家的孩子们在念书，非常眼红，常常央求母亲说：“我要念书！”母亲因为没有钱，不叫我去。有一回，我气的向学校跑，母亲就在后面追，在河沿上追上我，她抱着我哭了半天。
    三、有一天我和十几个小朋友上山去拾草，看见学校的周先生带着一帮学生去旅行。我把十几个拾草的小朋友集合起来，学学生们的步法，喊着“一二一”。那位周先生说我聪明，愿意介绍我到学校去念书。
