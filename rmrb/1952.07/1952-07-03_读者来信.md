    We are Actively Finding "Tricks" to Commemorate the 31st Anniversary of the Party's Founding
    To the Editor: The workers at the Liaoyang Textile Factory repairing the airport are commemorating the Party's birthday with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy. The task of increasing production and practicing economy assigned to us by the higher authorities is 635 tons of grain. After everyone "found tricks" and "tapped potential," we have now formulated a plan to increase grain production by 4,000 tons. The foundry team improved the allocation of labor and machinery, and by the end of the year, it can increase production and save 1,400 tons of grain. When the workers in the lathe team used multi-tool and multi-blade cutting to make fine yarn leather roller parts, they researched a circulating spring knife, which increased the output from five sets per day to ten sets, and the quality was 100% up to standard. This item alone can increase the country's grain production by 26 tons per year. Jia Yongtai used high-speed cutting on a belt lathe to process a certain workpiece, increasing the output by 55%. The 60 workers in the lathe team can increase grain production by 1,000 tons by the end of the year. When Xia Fengwu of the fitter team repaired 486 looms, he improved the "He Zuo Jiao" parts on the looms, increasing grain production by 61 tons. In addition, Hu Shangfu and Wang Shihai of the welding team solved the difficulty of melting welding rod materials when the supply of machine materials was in short supply, saving a total of 18.5 tons of grain in June.

    "Plastering Machine" Inventor Fu Hongbin Writes to Express
    His Desire to Further Improve Technology to Repay the Party
    To the Editor: We feel infinitely excited when celebrating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the great Communist Party of China. Because before liberation, we suffered the exploitation and oppression of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and feudal foremen, and our lives were not guaranteed, and our technology could not be developed. At that time, no matter how fast we used our trowels or how loud we knocked, we could not get enough to eat or wear. We could not get housing, and no one took care of us when we got sick. Now we are liberated, we have stood up, and we have been improved in all aspects of politics, life, culture, and technology. How did this come about? It was brought to us by our working class party and the respected Chairman Mao. So, what do we use to repay the Party and Chairman Mao? Only in our practical actions can we create more achievements. We know that our country is about to carry out large-scale economic construction, and our construction workers should be at the forefront of this great construction. We should humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other parts of the country, use our brains more, study technology, invent more, create more, strengthen unity, and dedicate all our strength to the construction of our great motherland.

    Southwest People Cheer for the Opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway
    To the Editor: This year's July 1st is the 31st anniversary of the Communist Party of China, and the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was opened to traffic on this day. How excited we people in the Southwest are!
    The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway demonstrates the great power of our Chinese working class. Every rail, every screw, and all the materials of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were made by Chinese workers themselves. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our Chinese working class spent only two years building the 505-kilometer-long Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will play a huge role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the development of industrial and agricultural production. The agricultural products of western Sichuan, the salt of Zigong, the sugarcane of Neijiang, the tobacco leaves and various medicinal materials of Ziyang and Jianyang will all be exported in large quantities due to the reduction in transportation costs by train. In the past, it cost more than 1.04 million yuan to transport one ton of sugar from Neijiang to Chongqing by truck; but it only costs 152,300 yuan by train. Zigong's salt production reaches more than 5.2 million dan per year, and it has always been supplied to the people of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. Ziyang and Jianyang produce about 45,000 dan of tobacco leaves annually, which have always been transported to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places. However, in the past, due to inconvenient transportation, the sales and output of these materials were greatly restricted. Now that we have the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the sales and output of these materials will definitely be greatly improved. The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also made the industrial and commercial circles in Chengdu see the prospects for industrial and commercial development, so they are willing to invest in industry. Now private factories such as the Chengdu Flour Mill, Yuhua Yarn Factory, and Zhonghua Paper Factory are actively planning to add equipment and expand production.

    Ma Wenzhi, Advanced Drilling Worker of Fuxin Mining Bureau
    Asks to Exchange Experience with Brother Mines
    To the Editor: I am a drilling worker with a low level of education. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, my class consciousness has been quickly raised, and I care more about the people's production cause than my own affairs. With the help and guidance of leading comrades, I have learned the advanced Soviet drilling experience (rapid drilling and the use of yellow mud slurry), and I have also come up with some ways to improve tools. The relevant leading agencies attach great importance to our experience and are widely promoting it in various mines. However, our achievements are still small, and we are far behind the Soviet Union in efficiency. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo and must continue to study hard and strive to further improve production efficiency.
    Now, I very much hope to understand the advanced experience of other brother factories and mines related to drilling work, and I am willing to establish a relationship of mutual teaching and learning and exchange of experience with these brother workshops based on class friendship. I am willing to absorb their advanced experience as soon as possible, and discuss, study, test, and promote it. For example, at the Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Technology Performance Conference, we learned the advanced experience of the Beipiao Mining Bureau in using iron sand to drill coarse holes to the end, and the method of a certain factory using waste pipes to change the wire buckle to save raw materials. After using the method of drilling coarse holes to the end with iron sand, the efficiency of some groups has doubled compared to the past. After using waste pipes to change the wire buckle, we saved many new pipes for the country. Therefore, I ask the newspaper to introduce the advantages and creations in the promotion of advanced experience in various places to us in a timely manner. Not knowing the various new creations of brother mines is like a cripple lacking a crutch, unable to learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses.
    Currently, our drilling workers hope that the factory and mine leaders can solve a welfare problem for us. Our exploration station workers generally eat and sleep in the open air, living in the wild and on the valleys. There are many mosquitoes in summer, which affects sleep and is also prone to infectious diseases. Our public dormitories are all temporary mobile houses with simple structures. It is best to add mobile screens to these houses or issue marching mosquito nets. Heating equipment should be added in winter.

    Beijing Seventh District Public Security Police Station
    Close Relationship Between Police and Residents After the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    To the Editor: After the "Three-Anti" movement, the work of the police stations under the Seventh Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau has seen a new atmosphere that has never been seen before. In the past, many cadres and police officers were not at ease doing public security work, but now they are working with peace of mind and actively. In the past, in the police station, no matter how many people asked to solve problems, no one except the person on duty would take care of it, but now they are all vying to do it. The 14th police station has only one director and three police officers. In May, they worked continuously for three consecutive nights to complete urgent tasks. Wang Zhaoxiang of the 11th police station, who manages the vendor market, goes to the market at four o'clock every morning, solving problems that four cadres and police officers had not solved in the past. The cadres and police officers of the 13th police station each voluntarily undertake a task outside their own business. The relationship between the police and the people has become closer. Local residents rarely came to the police station before the "Three-Anti" movement. Now, due to the change in the working attitude of the police, residents often come to the police station, and their relationship with the police station has become closer. Sang Ruzhi, a police officer at the 6th police station, meets an average of three residents every night. Gao Yongsen, a police officer at the 7th police station, if he does not go to the residents' homes every two days, the residents will ask: "Why don't you come to us!" Many newly emerging activists among the citizens voluntarily report the situation to the police station.

    Protest Against U.S. Airplanes' Indiscriminate Bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant
    To the Editor: Seeing the news that U.S. imperialism frantically bombed the Yalu River Power Plant and the wounded soldiers' hospital without any military targets, all of our employees are extremely angry.
    The armistice negotiations have been going on for a year, and the U.S. imperialists have exhausted the most despicable and shameless conspiracies to hinder the progress of the armistice negotiations. Now they have even further implemented so-called "military pressure" by destroying peaceful facilities in Korea. This will not only fail to scare us, but will further expose the base face and dying situation of the U.S. imperialists.
    We accuse the U.S. imperialists of this brutal crime to the peace-loving people of the world. The great Chinese people and the Korean people will fight back against the provocations of the U.S. imperialists with more heroic actions. All our factory employees have formulated a production and savings plan for the second half of the year, and we will definitely more powerfully support the heroic battles of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Accuse the Crimes of Imperialist Elements Cloaked in Religious Garb
    To the Editor: On June 4th, a pit of infant corpses was found in the Catholic Church on Chengdong Street, Guoxian County, Shanxi Province. A pile of broken infant corpses was excavated from this pit, with 1,537 skulls alone (including one adult skull). This is one of the "favors" bestowed by imperialist elements cloaked in religious garb in China. In 1946, an infant pit was also found in the Catholic Church in Guoxian County. According to people who saw it at the time, the number of corpses was even greater than what was found this time. But at that time, it was under the rule of the reactionaries, and people did not pay attention to this corpse pit. According to Catholics, there is another corpse pit in the residence of the Catholic Church, and it is currently being searched for. This is just the situation in a small place in Guoxian County. It can be seen how appalling the crimes of the imperialist elements in massacring the Chinese people are.
    We accuse the crimes of imperialist elements cloaked in religious garb in massacring Chinese infants!

    纪念党成立的三十一周年我们都在积极找“窍门”
    编辑同志：我们辽阳纺织厂修机场职工，都以增产节约的实际行动纪念党的生日。上级给我们的增产节约任务是六百三十五吨粮食，经大家“找窍门”、“挖潜力”，现在已经订出增产四千吨粮食的计划。翻砂班改进了劳动力的配备和机器工具，到年底可增产节约一千四百吨粮食。车工班职工用多刀多刃切削法制细纱皮辊罗拉零件时，研究了循环式弹簧刀，使产量由过去日产五套提高到十套，质量百分之百合乎规格。只是这一项每年便可给国家增产二十六吨粮食。贾永泰车某种工作物，在皮带车床上用高速切削法，产量提高了百分之五十五。车工班六十名职工，到年底可增产一千吨粮食。钳工班夏凤梧检修四百八十六台布机时，改进了织布机上的“和座角”零件，增产六十一吨粮食。另外，电焊组胡尚富、王世海，在机物料供不应求的情况下，解决了熔接焊条材料的困难，在六月份共节约粮食十八吨半。

    要更加提高技术来报答党
    编辑同志：在庆祝伟大的中国共产党成立三十一周年的时候，我们感到无限的兴奋。因为在解放前，我们受尽了帝国主义和国民党反动派以及封建把头们的剥削和压迫，生活没有保障，技术也得不到发展。那时候，我们的瓦刀用得再快，敲得再响，也吃不饱穿不暖。我们得不到房屋居住，有了病也没有人照管。现在我们解放了，翻身了，我们在政治、生活、文化和技术等各方面都得到了提高。这是怎么得来的呢？是我们工人阶级的党和敬爱的毛主席带给我们的。那么，我们用什么来报答党和毛主席呢？只有在我们的实际行动中，去创造更多的成绩。我们知道我们的国家正要开展大规模的经济建设，我们建筑工人就应该走在这个伟大建设的前头。虚心学习苏联和国内各地的先进经验，多用脑筋，钻研技术，多发明，多创造，搞好团结，为建设我们伟大的祖国献出所有的力量。

    西南人民欢呼成渝铁路通车
    编辑同志：今年七月一日是中国共产党三十一周年纪念日，成渝铁路在这一天全线通车，我们西南人民是多么兴奋呵！
    成渝铁路的修建，表现了我们中国工人阶级伟大的力量。成渝铁路的每一根钢轨、每一个螺丝钉和全部材料，都是中国工人们自己制造出来的。我们中国工人阶级在毛主席领导下，仅仅用了两年的时间，就把长达五百零五公里的成渝铁路修通了。成渝铁路的通车，对于促进城乡物资交流和工农业生产的发展，都将起极大的作用。川西区的农产品，自贡市的盐，内江的蔗糖，资阳、简阳的烟叶和各种药材，因为火车运送而降低了运费，都要大量地输出了。过去用汽车运内江的糖到重庆，每吨运费要一百零四万多元；但用火车运，每吨只用十五万二千三百元。自贡市的盐产量年达五百二十万担以上，一向供给四川、湖南、湖北和贵州等省人民之用，资阳、简阳的烟叶年产约四万五千担，一向运送到上海、广州、西安等地。但过去由于交通不便，这些物资的销路和产量都大大受到限制。现在有了成渝铁路，这些物资的销路和产量一定会大大提高。成渝铁路通车也使得成都工商界看到了工商业发展的远景，所以他们愿意投资于工业。现在成都建成面粉厂、裕华纱厂、中华纸厂等私营工厂正积极计划增添设备，扩大生产。

    要求和各兄弟矿交流经验
    编辑同志：我是一个文化不高的钻探工人。在党的培养教育下，我的阶级觉悟很快地提高了，我对人民的生产事业比对自己的事情还关心。在领导同志的帮助和指导下，我学习了苏联的先进钻探经验（快速钻进和使用黄泥浆），自己又想出一些改进工具的办法。有关的领导机关很重视我们的经验，正在各矿山广泛地推广。但是，我们的成绩还很小，比起苏联的效率还差得远。因此，我们不能满足于现状，一定要继续钻研，努力学习，争取更加提高生产效率。
    现在，我很希望了解其他兄弟厂矿有关钻探工作的先进经验，愿意在阶级友爱的基础上，和这些兄弟车间建立互教互学、交流经验的关系。我愿意尽快地把他们的先进经验吸收过来，加以讨论、研究、试验、推广。比如在东北基本建设先进技术表演大会上，我们就学会了北票矿务局使用铁砂子粗孔打到底的先进经验，和某厂利用废管子改套丝扣节省原材料的办法。使用铁砂子粗孔打到底的办法以后，有的小组效率比从前提高了一倍。利用废管子改套丝扣以后，我们就给国家节省下许多的新管子。因而我要求报纸能及时地把各地推广先进经验中的优点和创造介绍给我们。不知道各兄弟矿山的各种新创造，就像跛人缺个拐棍似的，无法取长补短。
    当前我们钻探工人们希望厂矿领导方面能为我们解决一个福利问题。我们探站工人一般都是风餐露宿，住在野地里、山谷上。夏天蚊虻很多，影响睡眠，也容易传染疾病。我们的公共宿舍都是些临时性的可以移动的房屋，构造简单。最好能够在这些房屋上增设移动纱窗或发给行军蚊帐。到了冬天应该添置取暖设备。

    北京市第七区公安派出所
    警察和居民“三反”后关系密切
    编辑同志：“三反”运动以后，北京市公安局第七区分局所属派出所的工作，出现了从来没有过的新气象。过去，许多干部、民警不安心于做公安工作，现在他们却是安心地、积极地工作了。过去，在派出所里，不管要求解决问题的人如何多，除了值班的人以外，就没有人去管，现在却都争着去干了。第十四派出所只有所长一人、民警三人，五月份他们曾经有三天连夜连续工作，坚持完成了急迫的任务。第十一派出所管理摊贩市场的王兆祥，每天早上四点钟便上市场，解决了过去四个干部、民警所没有解决的问题。第十三派出所的干部、民警，每人自动承担一件本身业务以外的工作。警民关系密切起来了。当地居民在“三反”运动以前，很少到派出所来，现在由于民警的工作态度改变了，居民们便常到派出所来，和派出所的关系更加密切了。第六派出所民警桑汝志，平均每天晚上接见三个居民。第七派出所民警高永森，如果隔两天不到居民家里，居民就问：“你为什么不到我们这儿来呀！”市民中许多新涌现的积极分子，都自动地到派出所反映情况。

    抗议美机滥炸鸭绿江发电厂
    编辑同志：看到美帝国主义狂炸鸭绿江发电厂和毫无军事目标的伤兵医院的消息，我们全体职工愤怒已极。
    停战谈判已一年了，美帝国主义者用尽了最卑鄙无耻的阴谋，阻碍停战谈判的进行，现在居然又进一步以破坏朝鲜的和平设备来实施所谓“军事压力”，这不但不能吓倒我们，反而进一步暴露了美帝国主义者的下流嘴脸和日暮途穷的处境。
    我们向全世界爱好和平的人民控诉美帝国主义者这种残暴罪行。伟大的中国人民和朝鲜人民将以更英勇的行动来还击美帝国主义的挑衅。我们全厂职工已制定了下半年的生产节约计划，我们一定更有力地支援朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的英勇战斗。

    控诉披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子的罪行
    编辑同志：六月四日，山西省崞县城东街天主教堂内，发现了一个婴儿尸骨坑。从这个坑内掘出一堆碎乱的婴儿尸骨，仅头骨就有一千五百三十七个
    （内大人头骨一个）。这是披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子在中国所施的“恩惠”之一。一九四六年，在崞县天主堂内也曾发现一个婴儿坑，据当时看见的人说，尸骨数目比这一次发现的还要多。但那时是在反动派统治之下，人们对这一尸骨坑并没有注意。据天主教徒反映，该天主堂住宅内还有一个尸骨坑，现在正寻找中。这只是崞县县城一个小地方的情况。可见帝国主义分子屠杀中国人民的罪行是多么惊人了。
    我们控诉披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子屠杀中国婴儿的罪行！
