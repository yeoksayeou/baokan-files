    The declaration by the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, calling on the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region to unite, strengthen, and expand the movement to defend peace, has been warmly endorsed and supported by the vast peace-loving people of various countries. Peace organizations and people from all walks of life are actively carrying out preparatory work to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing this autumn.
    After Gao Shangbi and Yani Ke, the representatives of India attending the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, returned to their country, they gave a series of detailed reports to the Indian people about the preparatory meeting. Many Indian newspapers prominently published the declaration of the preparatory meeting, attracting widespread attention from people in various places. Dr. Saifuddin, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, expressed his warm support for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference after hearing a detailed report from the Indian representatives on the proceedings of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. At the Korean War Anniversary memorial meeting held in Ahmedabad on June 25 and the peace rally protesting the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant held in Bombay on June 29, many Indian peace movement leaders spoke at the meetings. These included Mrs. Kripalani, a leader of the Socialist Party in Parliament, Mrs. Chakravarti, a member of Parliament from the Communist Party of India, and Dr. Kumarappa, who visited China last year as part of the Indian goodwill delegation. In Delhi, many members of Parliament belonging to different parties expressed their willingness to support the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Now, India has established the Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and representatives from the All-India Peace Committee and other organizations have participated in the work of this preparatory committee. The All-India Peace Committee has instructed its local organizations to actively promote preparatory work in various provinces and districts. The Indian Preparatory Committee for the Peace Conference has decided to hold "Asia Week" from August 3 to 10, and "Asia Day" on the 10th, calling on the people of India to launch extensive peace activities during this week, focusing on publicizing the great significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The Indian Preparatory Committee also decided to prepare for convening initiating meetings in most provinces across India at the end of August, and to convene an all-India initiating meeting in Delhi in early September. At this meeting, a broadly representative delegation of India to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be elected. These decisions and calls of the preparatory committee have received enthusiastic responses and support from trade unions, farmers' organizations, student unions, and women's associations, as well as the broad masses of the Indian people throughout India.
    In Japan, people from all walks of life have expressed great concern about the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The Japan Peace Preservation Committee has put forward five suggestions, including "concluding a non-aggression agreement for the Asian and Pacific region," as proposals to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and will promote the domestic peace movement in Japan in accordance with the direction of these five suggestions, with particular emphasis on promoting the movement against rearmament and conscription, and making the promotion of Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese trade and the success of the Korean armistice important goals of the peace movement. The specific guidelines for the Peace Movement Promotion Month issued by the Japan Peace Preservation Committee stipulated that a national movement aimed at the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference should be launched. First, local groups and various industries should discuss the significance of this peace conference separately, and then national groups, prominent figures, and various localities should recommend representatives to attend the conference. Therefore, this peace movement should not only be strengthened in trade unions, but also be developed to women and rural areas. The Japan Peace Preservation Committee has called on all strata and groups fighting for peace to unite and work together. Now, the Japan Preparatory Office for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has been established, with Masaharu Hatanaka as the Director of the Secretariat, actively carrying out preparatory work. Each prefecture and government in Japan has organized its own preparatory committee and is launching a campaign to elect representatives. Among the representatives who have been elected are the famous peace fighters Ikuo Oyama and Yoshitaro Hirano. Ikuo Oyama, Jiichiro Matsumoto, Koichi Uda, Ichiko Kamichika, Masaharu Hatanaka, and four others will file an administrative lawsuit with the court against the Yoshida government's previous refusal to issue them passports to attend the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, in order to break the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries to obstruct Japanese representatives from attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.
    People from all walks of life in Australia, Indonesia, and Ceylon have expressed great concern about the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and have launched heated discussions. Currently, the Australian peace organization—the Pacific Peace Committee—and people's organizations are working hard to elect a broadly representative delegation. The Indonesian Peace Committee has elected Pastor Utosia to participate in the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Pastor Utosia departed from Jakarta on July 5 and arrived in Beijing on July 20. Peace organizations and people in Ceylon are now actively engaged in the work of electing representatives.
    In Canada, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has attracted widespread attention from the people across the country. They have elected Finlay McKinnon as a member of the preparatory committee. The initiating committee has begun its work.
    In Korea and Vietnam, as well as other countries in the Asian and Pacific region, the broad masses of the people have expressed their warm support for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and are actively preparing to send their own representatives to attend.
    The representatives of Latin American countries, El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Chile, and Mexico, who attended the Berlin Council meeting, took advantage of the opportunity to meet in Berlin to discuss how to promote preparatory work and send representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in September, and separately suggested to the peace organizations of Latin American countries to further promote preparatory work.
