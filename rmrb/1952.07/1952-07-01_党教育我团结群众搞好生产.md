    The Party Educates Me to Unite the Masses and Do a Good Job in Production
    Liu Lifu, Advanced Production Team Leader, Lüda District

    As we welcome the Party's birthday – "July 1st," I truly have an indescribable excitement. Over the past few years, under the Party's education and nurturing, I have been undertaking the country's construction tasks. Recalling when the Party went public in 1949, I had the desire to join the Party. In the second half of that year, the factory launched a new record creation campaign; the Party continuously educated me, and I became closer to the Party. In production, I became even more energetic. In January 1950, I overfulfilled the production target by 419 percent. However, there were frequent disunities within our team, and I myself had serious problems of detachment from the masses. My request to join the Party was not approved. The Party continued to educate me to overcome my shortcomings so that production could be maintained normally. According to the Party's instruction to "strengthen unity with the masses," I persevered, overcame my shortcomings, and on February 4, 1950, I finally gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    Under the Party's constant education and nurturing, my class consciousness gradually improved, and I understood that Party members are advanced elements of the working class and must play an exemplary and leading role in every movement. Under the guidance of this thought, I used criticism and self-criticism to unite all the workers in the team and study the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. We used our brains in every task. Therefore, on February 4, 1950, we won the glorious title of Lüda New Record Advanced Team.
    I have been to Beijing twice and saw Chairman Mao both times. My confidence in victory and enthusiasm for production have been greatly enhanced. Our team's gift to the Party is to complete the entire year's production target for 1955 before "July 1st." I will never be arrogant or complacent. In this production increase and economy practice movement, our team has already found twenty-two tricks to ensure that the monthly production target is overfulfilled and that 100% of the finished products meet the specifications, and we will strive to complete and exceed the target of increasing production and practicing economy by 300 tons of grain for our team!

### 党教育我团结群众搞好生产

    党教育我团结群众搞好生产
    旅大区先进生产小组长  刘立富
    在迎接党的生日——“七一”的时候，我真有一种说不出来的兴奋。几年来，我在党的教育和培养下，担负着国家的建设任务。回想一九四九年党公开的时候，我就有了入党的心愿。这年的下半年，厂里开展创造新纪录运动；党不断地教育我，我也更加靠近了党，在生产上，更起劲了。一九五零年一月，我超额完成生产任务的百分之四百十九。但我们小组内经常闹不团结，我自己有着严重的脱离群众的毛病，要求入党没有被批准。党仍然不断地教育我克服毛病，使生产能够保持正常。我根据党的“加强团结群众”的指示，再接再励，克服缺点，在一九五零年二月四日，终于光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    我在党的不断教育和培养下，阶级觉悟逐步提高了，明白了党员是工人阶级先进分子，在每个运动当中必须起模范作用和带头作用。我在这个思想指导下，以批评和自我批评的方法，团结小组全体工友，学习苏联的先进经验。在每一件活上，我们都开动脑筋。因此，一九五零年二月四日，我们获得了旅大新纪录先进小组的光荣称号。
    我到过两次北京，都看见了毛主席。我的胜利信心和生产热情更加提高了。我们小组给党的献礼是在“七一”前完成一九五五年的全年生产任务。我决不骄不傲。在这次增产节约运动中，我们小组已找出二十二件窍门，保证每月超额完成生产任务，保证成品百分之百合规格，为本组完成和超过增产节约三百吨粮食而奋斗！
