Editor's Note: This spring, mutual aid teams have developed rapidly in various regions. Strengthening the leadership of these mutual aid teams by leading organs, consolidating them, and gradually improving them is a very important task. It is hoped that leading organs in various regions will go deep among the masses, discover and solve problems in this area, so that various mutual aid and cooperative organizations can play a greater role and make future production even better.

Zhang Shude's plowing and labor exchange team in Xinzhuangzi Village, Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province, was organized during the preparation for spring plowing this year. The team consisted of seven households, six and a half laborers, three donkeys, and eleven *xiang* of land. Two of the households ran tofu workshops. After the team finished planting the land, it broke up. When summer weeding began, only Jin Shicheng and Li Fengjiang were left to exchange labor for weeding. In late May, the work team of the Jinxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China came to Xinzhuangzi Village to help rectify mutual aid organizations. After in-depth research, the main reasons for the team's breakup were found to be: (1) Difficult households had ideological concerns. Li Fengjiang and Jin Shicheng's families lacked food rations. They were afraid that when collective weeding was implemented, they would have to provide meals, and their meals would not be good, and others might say they were trying to take advantage. Cao You and Li Fenghai's families had no livestock. They were afraid that using the team's livestock to plow their land would require them to pay cash. They wanted to hire livestock from relatives and friends and pay them back in the fall. (2) The exchange rate between manual labor and animal labor was not equal. One day of labor was valued at ten points (equivalent to 10,000 yuan), and one day of donkey labor was valued at eight points (equivalent to 8,000 yuan). The livestock owners fed the animals themselves. Recently, the price of fodder has risen. One donkey needs 8,500 yuan worth of fodder per day (one donkey needs one *sheng* of sorghum, equivalent to 4,000 yuan; four *jin* of bean cake, equivalent to 1,500 yuan; and eight *jin* of grass, equivalent to 3,000 yuan). The labor price was not even enough to cover the cost of fodder, and the livestock owners felt they were at a disadvantage, so they wanted to withdraw from the team. In addition, because all laborers were rated at ten points, weaker laborers could not join the team. Li Fengjiang's family had two *xiang* of land. His father was old, equivalent to half a laborer. If they worked on their own, the two of them could manage. If he joined the mutual aid team, he would have to find money to exchange labor in the team (his father was not qualified to join the mutual aid team), which affected his enthusiasm for joining the mutual aid team. (3) During spring plowing, if there was a shortage of labor, the land could not be planted. During summer weeding, one person could weed. Therefore, during the summer weeding period, the individualistic nature of individual farmers was more easily exposed. Cao You used to go late and return early when weeding his own land, and he rested when he was tired. He was afraid of collective weeding, which would be tiring and not "free," so he withdrew from the team and worked on his own. The team leader was afraid that during the summer weeding period, everyone would argue about the order of work, making it difficult to lead, and lost confidence and abandoned leadership. (4) Agricultural and sideline production conflicted. Zhang Shude and Zhang Shulin's families ran tofu workshops, selling tofu every morning, and spent less time engaged in agricultural production. There was not much surplus labor in the team. During the spring plowing period, after everyone else's work was done, they went to work for them. Everyone else's seedlings had emerged, but Zhang Shulin's cotton had not yet been sown. Later, they hired short-term labor to plant it. Therefore, they did not want to help each other.

In order to solve these problems, the work team first educated the team members on organizing, patriotic production increase, and the social vision. The team members began to think. The work team used the immediate example of this team, "Jin Shicheng and Li Fengjiang's collective weeding resulted in more work, and the cotton field has already been weeded twice and cultivated once, while Cao You working alone has only weeded it once," to illustrate the benefits of organizing. Then, the work team led the team to hold a meeting to study ways to consolidate the mutual aid team. These methods were: (1) Whoever's land is being weeded, eat at their house, eat whatever is available, and don't be picky about food and drink (Editor's note: It is best to eat your own food without hindering production). Wages for manual labor and animal labor that cannot be paid at present will be paid back in the fall. (2) Implement a simple work evaluation and point-recording system. Absorb Li Fengjiang's father into the team and temporarily give him five points. Raise the donkey labor to twelve points per day. (3) During the busy farming season, sideline production should be subordinate to agriculture and should not affect weeding and cultivation. Zhang Shude himself decided to make tofu every night and let his children sell it the next morning, and he himself participated in agricultural production. (4) Hold a team meeting every seven days to exchange opinions and check work; and arrange the weeding order according to conditions such as the amount of weeds, the size of seedlings, and the soil quality. Weed the low-lying areas before rain and weed the sandy soil after rain. In this way, the problems were solved, and the team members' morale was high. They also formulated a summer weeding plan and a team covenant. The gist of the covenant is: individual interests are subordinate to team interests, abide by labor discipline, obey the team leader's leadership, and discuss matters together. The seven households in the team then worked together again. The team members all expressed: ensure that the team does not collapse, complete the summer weeding plan, and strive for the bumper harvest red flag.

The work team introduced the experience of rectifying this team at the mutual aid team leader meeting, and many mutual aid teams also began to inspect and reorganize their own teams.

    辽西省锦西县张树德互助组是怎样巩固起来的
    锦西县工作组
    编者按：今年春季，各地的互助组大量发展。领导机关对这些互助组加强领导，使它巩固起来，并逐步提高，这是一个十分重大的工作。希望各地领导机关深入群众，发现和解决这一方面的问题，使各种互助合作组织发挥更大的作用，使今后的生产搞得更好。
    辽西省锦西县新庄子村张树德插犋换工组是在今年准备春耕期间组织起来的。全组共七户，六个半劳动力，三头驴，十一垧地。其中有两户开豆腐坊。这个小组种完了地，就散伙了。到夏锄开始的时候，只剩了金士成、李凤江两个人在一起换工铲地。五月下旬，中共锦西县委工作组来到新庄子村，帮助整顿互助组织。经过深入研究，找出了这个组散伙的主要原因：（一）困难户有思想顾虑。李凤江、金士成两家缺口粮，他们害怕实行集体铲地时，轮到自己家里管饭，自己的饭菜不好，别人可能说自己耍尖头。曹友、李凤海两家没有牲口，他们怕用组内的牲口给自己趟地，给不起现钱。他们想雇亲友的牲口，秋后还钱。（二）人工和畜工换工不等价。劳动力干一天活评十分（合一万元），驴干一天活评八分（合八千元），牲口由畜主自己喂。最近草料涨价，一头驴一天得用八千五百元的草料（一头驴一天需一升高粱，合四千元；四斤豆饼，合一千五百元；八斤草，合三千元），工价还不够草料钱，畜主感觉吃亏，因此要退组。另外，因为劳动力都评十分，劳动力弱的人就不能入组。李凤江家有两垧地，他父亲年老，相当半个劳动力，如果自己单干，两个人也能干得了；如果参加互助组，他自己在组里换工得往外找钱（他父亲没有参加互助组的条件），这就影响了他参加互助组的积极性。（三）春耕时，劳动力少就种不上，夏锄时，一个人也能铲地。因此，在夏锄期间，个体农民的散漫性更容易暴露出来。曹友过去给自己铲地，时常晚去早回，累了就休息；他怕集体铲地，受累又不“自由”，所以退组单干了。组长怕在夏锄期间，大家争执先后，不好领导，失掉了信心，放弃了领导。（四）农业和副业生产发生矛盾。张树德、张树林两家开豆腐坊，天天上午卖豆腐，从事农业生产的时间较少；组内的劳动力没有多少剩余，春耕期间，别人的活都做完了，才去给他们做，别人的小苗都出来了，张树林的棉花还没播种，后来还是雇了短工才种上的；因此，他们也就不想互助了。
    工作组为了解决这些问题，首先对组员进行了组织起来、爱国增产和社会远景的教育。组员的思想开始活动了，工作组就用这个小组“金士成和李凤江集体铲地多出活，棉田已经铲完二遍、趟完一遍，曹友单干，才铲完头遍”的眼前例子，说明组织起来的好处。接着，工作组又领导小组开会，研究了巩固互助组的办法。这些办法是：（一）给谁铲地在谁家吃饭，做什么就吃什么，不挑吃喝（编者按：最好在不妨碍生产的原则下，自己吃自己的饭）。人工、畜工的工资，目前确实给不起的，到秋后再还。（二）实行简单的评工记分制度。吸收李凤江的父亲入组，暂时给评五分。把驴工提到一天十二分。（三）农忙季节，副业服从农业，不得影响多铲多趟。张树德自己决定每天晚间做豆腐，第二天早晨让小孩去卖，自己参加农业生产。（四）七天开一次小组会，交换意见，检查工作；并根据杂草多少、禾苗大小、土质情况等条件，排列铲地次序。雨前先铲洼地，雨后先铲沙土地。这样解决了问题，组员情绪都高了，还订了夏锄计划和小组公约。公约的大意是：个人利益服从小组利益，遵守劳动纪律，服从组长领导，有事大家商量。全组七户于是又在一起干活了。组员们都表示：保证小组不垮，完成夏锄计划，争取丰产红旗。
    工作组在互助组长会上介绍了整顿这个组的经验，许多互助组也都开始来检查整理自己的小组。
