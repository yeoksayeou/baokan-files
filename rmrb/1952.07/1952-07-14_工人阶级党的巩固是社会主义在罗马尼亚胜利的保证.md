The Consolidation of the Working Class Party is the Guarantee of Socialism's Victory in Romania
Mogioroș, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party

Our Party, since its establishment, whether in the underground phase – during the rule of the brutal landlord regime – or after the Soviet army liberated Romania and our Party seized power, has achieved many successes and victories. The root of all these achievements and victories lies in the great revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The Party's Marxist-Leninist line, its strategies and tactics, and its persistent struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people, for the national independence of the motherland, and for socialism, have always been and still are warmly welcomed and actively supported by the working class and all working people.

In the flames of this struggle, the revolutionary alliance of the working class and the working peasantry has been tempered, and tens of thousands of communist fighters have emerged. They are the excellent sons of the working class, infinitely loyal to the cause of Lenin and Stalin. They protect the unity and iron discipline of the Party's ranks as if they were their own eyes. They persistently struggle against distorting the Party's line and strive for its thorough implementation.

The strength of the Party lies in its inseparable connection with the masses of the people. The masses believe that the Party's policies, which represent the vital interests of the working people, are their own policies. The Party constantly listens to the opinions of the masses and strives not only to educate the masses but also to learn from them.

Under the leadership of the Party, millions of working people in our country actively participated in the land reform, the overthrow of the reactionary government of Rădescu, the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment and consolidation of the people's democratic system, and the struggle to nationalize industry, banks, and transportation. The Party has mobilized and guided the creativity of the masses, and is currently victoriously implementing the policy of socialist industrialization in Romania, with a view to laying the foundation for the effective development of the entire national economy, and is implementing the policy of consolidating the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, restricting and eliminating capitalist elements in rural and urban areas, and implementing the policy of the socialist transformation of agriculture. The policy pursued by the Party is a policy of constantly consolidating the people's democratic regime as a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a policy of striving for the participation of as many working people as possible in the struggle for peace, and maintaining close alliance and friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The participation of hundreds of thousands of working people in the management of the state and the construction of socialism, the widespread development of the socialist emulation movement, the emergence of the Stakhanovite movement in industry, and the achievements of socialist components in agriculture all clearly and surely prove the superiority of this policy. Our socialist industry, primarily the industry that manufactures the means of production, is rapidly expanding and developing. More and more masses of working peasants are engaging in collective farming. The material and cultural living standards of the working people are improving.

All these achievements have been made by the people and the Party after overcoming various difficulties arising from the increasingly stubborn resistance of domestic class enemies, and in the context of the increasingly powerful struggle of hundreds of millions of people in countries around the world to safeguard and consolidate peace and oppose the war instigators, the American and British imperialists.

I

V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin repeatedly emphasized that the idea that socialism can be built without class struggle is merely a naive dream. They warned that after the dictatorship of the proletariat is realized, the class struggle will inevitably become more acute and will take on new forms, and that in this situation, there must be a high degree of revolutionary vigilance.

Comrade Stalin, in explaining the reasons why the class struggle becomes more acute during the transitional stage from capitalism to socialism, pointed out:

"Socialism victoriously launches an offensive against capitalist elements, socialism grows faster than capitalist elements, and the proportion of capitalist elements therefore decreases. Precisely because the proportion of capitalist elements decreases, the capitalist elements feel the danger of extinction and intensify their resistance. And they still have the possibility of strengthening their resistance temporarily, not only because they have the help of world capitalism, but also because their proportion is decreasing, their relative growth is decreasing compared with the growth of socialism, but the absolute growth of capitalist elements still exists, which also gives them considerable possibilities to accumulate strength to resist the process of socialist growth." The resistance of capitalist elements during the transition period takes extremely different forms, including sabotage, infiltration into the Party under the direction of imperialists to carry out assassinations and espionage, and undermining Party unity.

The experience of our Party fully proves the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's wise theories.

The Central Committee of the Party believes that due to the anti-Party and anti-state activities carried out by Luca, the financial and monetary system and cooperative institutions were filled with a large number of alien elements, who gathered around Luca and actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to subvert the people's democratic regime and sabotage our country's work of laying the foundation for a socialist economy. The original industrialists, landlords, and bank owners who infiltrated our financial and monetary system and cooperative system concentrated their destructive forces to create chaos and anarchy in the socialist sector of the national economy, conspiring in this way to undermine the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, which is the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The enemies of the people used extremely different methods and forms to carry out their criminal activities. The enemies of the people opposed the Party's policy of restricting and eliminating capitalist elements in rural and urban areas, and implemented their counter-revolutionary policy of encouraging and condoning capitalist elements. For example, they classified a large number of rich peasants as "middle peasants," helping them to evade the obligation to pay public grain, and helping them to undermine the taxation policy of the people's democratic regime. When purchasing and ordering agricultural products, they illegally raised prices, thus making it possible for rich peasants and speculators to profiteer, because the stipulated selling prices of certain kinds of manufactured goods in rural areas were lower than the cost of production. They opposed the development of socialist components in agriculture, and they withheld the deposits of state-owned farms in banks. The alien policies they implemented in taxation, loans, ordering agricultural products, and setting prices hindered the socialist transformation of agriculture.

In order to sabotage the socialist industrialization plan, alien elements intentionally withheld investment funds, especially investment in heavy industry (heavy industry is the key to the national economy), and withheld appropriations for socialist construction work (such as the Danube-Black Sea Canal project, the "Spark Newspaper" building project, and other projects).

During the preparation and implementation of the currency reform, these counter-revolutionaries attempted to spread dissatisfaction and undermine the trust of the working people in the Party and the government. On the eve of the currency reform, many workers in major industrial enterprises received old lei when they received their wages, for which these counter-revolutionaries should be held responsible. They were also the ones who spread various provocative rumors long before the currency reform; their purpose was to help capitalist elements and speculators evade the impact of the currency reform on the one hand, and to confuse the masses on the other hand.

Due to the vigorous struggle waged by the working class and the working peasantry under the leadership of the Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the criminal activities of the enemies of the people were exposed and defeated.

II

Due to the anti-Party and anti-state activities carried out by Luca, and with Luca's direct support, alien elements who infiltrated the financial and monetary system and cooperative system were able to carry out their criminal activities. Luca lost his class consciousness, cut himself off from the Party and the working class, colluded with a group of alien elements, abandoned the Party's general line, and implemented his own opportunist line. Luca became the main representative of the right-leaning deviation that deviated from the Party's line, and the main disseminator of the opportunist line.

Luca's anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist line, which he had defended in words and in writing for several years, and which he had also implemented in his work, delayed the socialist industrialization of Romania and the socialist transformation of agriculture, hindered the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, fueled speculation, and undermined the plan to pay public grain and the plan to purchase grain and other food. This line of his caused serious damage to the work of supplying the working class and all working people.

Luca's opportunist line deviated from the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle. His anti-Marxist view was that during the transition from capitalism to socialism, the class struggle would not become more acute, but would weaken; capitalist elements could peacefully transition to socialism; the key to national economic development was not socialist industrialization, but the rich peasants' acquisition of exorbitant profits.

In reality, this obvious opportunist line was manifested in the following aspects: hindering the development of the industry that manufactures the means of production, sabotaging state-owned farms and collective farms, opposing the establishment and development of peasant associations for collective farming, setting prices based on market prices when purchasing and ordering agricultural products, undermining the purchasing power of the old lei before the currency reform, and lowering the purchasing power of the working class. This line prevented the living standards of the working class and the working people from being raised to the level expected by the Party and the government.

The Party's line on the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry was determined as early as March 1949 by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej based on the principles of Lenin-Stalin theory, when he emphasized: "Our policy towards the peasants must be clearly defined, namely: we rely on the poor peasants, strengthen the alliance with the middle peasants, and wage a constant struggle against the rich peasants." Luca, who occupied an important position in the Party and state organs, violated these instructions of the Party, and helped and encouraged capitalist elements in rural areas in various ways, thereby striking at the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, and striking at the people's democratic regime.

As early as March 1949, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized at the plenary session of the Central Committee that in the current situation, the main significance of cooperatives lies in the fact that they combine the private interests of millions of poor and middle peasants with the common interests of the working class in order to build socialism and create the preconditions for working peasants to embark on the road of socialism more easily.

Luca's anti-Leninist line on the peasant issue, which violated the interests of the working class and the working peasantry, was also particularly evident in the issue of consumer cooperatives, which he believed were only for the purpose of transferring manufactured goods from urban areas to rural areas.

As Minister of Finance, Luca, in order to support the counter-revolutionaries, completely retained the institutions of the old bourgeois-landlord financial and monetary system; promoted alien elements, former "Siguranța" secret agents and fascists, and former landlords and capitalists to leading positions; this policy was in line with his anti-Party line on cadres. Contrary to our Party's Lenin-Stalin policy of selecting cadres based on both ability and integrity, Luca used experts as a cover to install alien elements in state organs. At the same time, he suppressed criticism, attacked the creativity and initiative of Party members, and implemented a policy of corruption and discrimination against cadres who were loyal to the cause of the Party.

Luca's anti-Party line was not accidental. As early as the underground activity period, he was one of the leaders of anti-Party sectarian struggles. Now it is only a continuation of his past deviations and sectarian activities.

The leadership of the Party has repeatedly refuted Luca's opportunism. However, Luca adopted the two-faced tactics characteristic of deviationists, deceiving the Party, ostensibly accepting the Party's line and decisions, but in reality adhering to his opportunist line.

The anti-Party and anti-state nature of Luca's line was fully exposed in the work of preparing and implementing the currency reform. He not only took direct and open actions to oppose the currency reform, but also tried every means to sabotage the currency reform.

The Central Committee held a plenary session from May 26 to 27 and decided to expel Luca from the Central Committee; and filed a complaint against him to the Party's Supervisory Committee.

Our Party has launched a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against right-leaning deviations and the conciliatory attitude of tolerating such deviations.

Comrade Stalin taught us that right-leaning deviations are extremely dangerous because they reflect the resistance of stubborn elements of the dying class. "The source of the strength of right-wing opportunism is the strength of petty-bourgeois elements, the strength generated by the pressure of capitalist elements, especially rich peasants, on the Party." (Stalin)

Revolutionary vigilance, Party principles, and class irreconcilability in the struggle against right-leaning tendencies and against all opportunist vacillations are the most important conditions for the victorious construction of socialism.

III

Luca was able to launch his anti-Party activities because he received the support and encouragement of Comrades Georgescu and Pauker, who adopted a conciliatory attitude and supported the right-leaning deviation that deviated from the Party's line.

Comrade Georgescu's conciliatory attitude towards Luca's right-wing opportunism concealed his own right-wing opportunist errors. He himself lacked combativeness in the struggle against class enemies, and lost revolutionary vigilance in his work. This allowed alien elements to carry out their sabotage activities. Of particular importance is that Comrade Georgescu did not take resolute measures against speculators who plundered industrial workers and working peasants.

Comrade Pauker's conciliatory attitude towards Luca also concealed her own mistakes. She herself had deviated from the Party's line on the agricultural issue and the public grain issue. Her deviation was manifested in her lack of emphasis on the establishment of new collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives, in her tolerance of rich peasants infiltrating collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives, and in her lack of concern for machine tractor stations and state-owned farms, which enabled alien elements to infiltrate tractor stations and state-owned farms. Comrade Pauker also made "left"-leaning mistakes that deviated from the Party's line. The participation of working peasants in collective farms must be conscious and voluntary. However, Comrade Pauker tolerated people violating this principle.

Pauker cultivated unprincipled relationships within the Party's leadership organs. Luca, Pauker, and Georgescu had secretly discussed a set of political issues beforehand. They concealed this from the Party and did so secretly for a long period of time. This was a serious violation of Party discipline, an attempt to establish factions, and a violation of the principles of iron-clad Party unity and Party leadership, which is completely impermissible in a Marxist-Leninist Party.

Comrade Stalin taught us that:

"The problem is that after declaring war on right-leaning deviations, right-leaning deviationists often disguise themselves as conciliators, placing the Party in a difficult position. In order to prevent this trick of right-leaning deviationists, we must insist on a resolute struggle against the conciliatory attitude.

This conciliatory tendency is definitely a form of opportunism. That is to say: in order to completely smash opportunism, it is necessary to liquidate the conciliatory attitude towards opportunism. Based on this, the Central Committee is mobilizing the entire Party to fight against the conciliatory tendency of opportunism.

The plenary session of the Central Committee held from May 26 to 27 considered Comrade Georgescu's self-criticism to be unsatisfactory, and therefore unanimously decided to remove him from his positions in the Political Bureau, the Organization Department, and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and to demote him.

After severely criticizing Comrade Pauker's mistakes, the plenary committee unanimously agreed to give her a warning punishment and did not elect her to the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee.

As a result of the criticism, Comrade Pauker admitted some of the mistakes she had made and assured the plenary session that she would fight for the Party's line and its resolutions.

IV

The resolutions of the March and May (1952) plenary sessions of the Central Committee prove the strength and firmness of the Romanian Workers' Party. These resolutions prove that the iron-clad unity and discipline within the Party are not achieved by concealing differences, but by exposing and eliminating these differences, and by waging a ruthless struggle against deviations and conciliatory tendencies that endanger the unity of the Party. The iron-clad Bolshevik discipline that is the foundation of the Party must be equally observed by all Party members and Party leaders, including those who "have made contributions in the past" and those who do not consider it their duty to implement the Party's resolutions after becoming "rulers."

Boldly launching criticism and self-criticism is a manifestation of the Party's strength, not its weakness. Comrade Stalin taught that: "A party that is not afraid of criticism and self-criticism, if it does not conceal the mistakes and shortcomings in its work, if it draws lessons from the mistakes in the Party's work to educate its cadres, if it knows how to correct mistakes in time, this party is an invincible party."

Exposing and eliminating right-leaning deviations in our Party is a serious blow to domestic and foreign enemies, which means that a huge obstacle that hindered the economic prosperity of our country and hindered the further improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people has been removed.

The experience of the Bolshevik Party teaches that the Party, as the vanguard of the working class and its fighting general staff, cannot tolerate the existence of vacillators, opportunists, capitulationists, or traitors in its ranks. If a party has opportunists, capitulationists, or traitors in its ranks, it is impossible to wage a life-and-death struggle against class enemies. To win victory, the working-class party must first cleanse itself of all kinds of opportunists. Cleansing opportunists can make the Party stronger.

Mobilizing the entire Party to fight against opportunism and the conciliatory attitude towards opportunism helps to improve the level of all work of Party organizations, state organs, and mass organizations, can make the Party's will and actions more consistent, and increase Party members' sense of responsibility and loyalty to the great cause of socialist construction in our country.

It can be said with confidence that the Party's prestige among the masses has been enhanced, because the people see that the Party puts the interests of the working people above all else, and it unhesitatingly takes resolute measures against those who endanger the interests of the people, regardless of their position in the Party or in the country.

The struggle against opportunism and the conciliatory attitude towards it is inextricably linked to the struggle to strengthen the Party's ranks, politically and ideologically temper Party members, apply Bolshevik methods in the Party's work, and strictly observe the Party's principles in accordance with Party discipline. We must and must increasingly deepen intra-Party democracy and ensure that all Party members are mobilized to participate in the struggle to implement the Party's Marxist-Leninist line. The Party severely condemns any act of suppressing criticism. The Party's leading organs must systematically check the implementation of resolutions and report their work to the Party members who elected them. These reports must be discussed in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. Party organizations and all Party members must constantly strengthen their ties with the masses—this is the guarantee of the Party's invincibility.

It is impossible to accomplish the Party's practical work without diligently and steadfastly mastering Marxist-Leninist theory. Only a deep understanding of the economic and political problems in socialist construction can enable Party members to maintain the correct direction in their daily work and prevent them from making mistakes and producing deviations.

The Central Committee requires the Party to pay special attention to new and increasingly numerous cadres, and requires it to educate them in the spirit of high class consciousness, in the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism, and in the Bolshevik spirit of adopting an irreconcilable attitude towards deviations that deviate from the Party's Marxist-Leninist principles. This will enable us to implement "a proletarian policy based on a constant offensive against capitalism, a firm policy of building socialism." (Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej)

Recently, the work of admitting new Party members has resumed. Excellent workers and peasants—members of agricultural cooperatives, commanders and fighters of the People's Army, intellectuals, and excellent members of the Labor Youth League are requesting to join the vanguard of the Romanian working class in order to work better for peace and socialism. Insisting on the Lenin-Stalin principle of individually admitting Party members and ensuring that the Party has a sound social composition will enable the Party to become stronger further and more rapidly.

Consolidating our motherland means consolidating the peace camp, and at the same time weakening the imperialist camp. We cannot and should not forget that the American and British imperialists and their right-wing social democrats and Titoist running dogs believe that the Communist Party and the Workers' Party are one of the major obstacles hindering them from realizing their aggression plots. They attempt to use all possible deviations to weaken the Party's unity and combat effectiveness. Smashing right-leaning deviations is also a great victory for our people in the struggle for peace.

Closely united around the Central Committee headed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, constantly learning from the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, the beloved leader of the working people all over the world, constantly strengthening unity and discipline and ties with the masses, our Party will inevitably continue to struggle in the future to further consolidate the people's democratic regime and to gloriously fulfill the task of organizers and leaders of our country's great cause of building socialism.

    工人阶级党的巩固是社会主义在罗马尼亚胜利的保证
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记  莫吉奥罗什
    我们党自从成立以来，无论在地下阶段——在残暴的地主政权统治的时期——或是在苏军解放罗马尼亚和我们党掌握政权以后，都获得了许多成就和胜利；这一切成就和胜利的根源，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的革命理论。党的马克思—列宁主义路线、党的战略和策略、党为争取人民的自由和幸福，为争取祖国的民族独立，争取社会主义而进行的坚持不懈的斗争，一向是而且现在仍然是得到工人阶级和一切劳动人民热烈响应和积极支持的。
    在这个斗争的烈火中，锻炼了工人阶级和劳动农民的革命联盟，涌现出成千成万的共产主义战士，他们是工人阶级的优秀儿子，他们无限忠诚于列宁—斯大林的事业，他们像珍重自己的眼珠一样地保卫党的队伍的团结和铁的纪律，他们坚持不懈地进行斗争，反对歪曲党的路线，争取党的路线的彻底执行。
    党之所以有力量，在于党与人民群众之间有不可分离的联系。群众认为，代表劳动人民的切身利益的党的政策，就是他们自己的政策。党经常倾听群众的意见，并且不仅努力教育群众，也努力向群众学习。
    我国数以百万计的劳动人民，在党的领导下，积极地参加了土地改革、推翻拉德士古反动政府、推翻君主制度、建立并巩固人民民主制度、以及把工业、银行和运输机构收归国有的斗争。党发动和指导了群众的创造力，目前正在胜利地执行罗马尼亚社会主义工业化的政策，以期奠定有效地发展整个国民经济的基础，并在执行巩固工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟、限制并消灭农村和城市中的资本主义分子的政策，在执行农业社会主义化的政策。党所执行的政策，是不断地巩固作为无产阶级专政的一种形式的人民民主政权的政策，是争取尽可能多的劳动人民参加争取和平的斗争、与伟大的苏联和人民民主国家维持紧密联盟与友好的政策。数十万的劳动人民参加了管理国家和建设社会主义的工作、社会主义竞赛运动的广泛展开、工业中出现了斯达哈诺夫运动、以及农业中的社会主义成分的成就，这一切都清楚地确实地证明了这个政策的优越性。我国的社会主义工业，首先是制造生产工具的工业，正在迅速地扩大和发展。越来越多的劳动农民群众正在从事集体耕作。劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平正在提高。
    这一切成就都是人民和党在克服了由于国内阶级敌人的日益顽强的抵抗而产生的种种困难以后，在全世界各国亿万人民为维护并巩固和平、反对战争挑拨者美英帝国主义者而进行的斗争日益强大的情况下取得的。
    一
    乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林屡次着重地指出：认为不必进行阶级斗争就能建设社会主义的观念，不过是一种天真的梦想而已。他们曾经提出警告说：在无产阶级专政实现了以后，阶级斗争不可避免地将更趋尖锐，并且将采取新的形式，在这种情况之下，必须有高度的革命警惕性。
    斯大林同志在解释从资本主义到社会主义这一个过渡阶段的阶级斗争所以更趋尖锐的理由时指出：
    “社会主义胜利地展开对资本主义分子的进攻，社会主义比资本主义分子增长得快些，资本主义分子底比重因此降落下去，正因为资本主义分子底比重降落下去，所以资本主义分子就感觉有灭亡危险，而加紧实行反抗。而他们暂时还有加强实行反抗的可能，这不仅是因为有世界资本主义帮助他们，而且还因为他们的比重虽然是降落着，他们的相对增长与社会主义底增长比较起来虽然是减低着，但资本主义分子底绝对增长还是有的，这也就使他们有相当的可能来积聚力量，以反抗社会主义增长过程。”资本主义分子在过渡期间的反抗是采取极其不同的形式的，其中包括阴谋破坏、在帝国主义者的指使下混进党内进行暗杀和间谍活动并破坏党的团结等方法。
    我们党的经验充分证明了列宁和斯大林的明智的理论的正确性。
    党中央委员会认为：由于卢加所进行的反党反国家活动，财政金融系统和合作社机构中都充满了大量的异己分子，他们聚集在卢加的周围积极进行反革命活动，企图颠覆人民民主制度并破坏我国奠定社会主义经济基础的工作。混进我们的财政金融系统和合作社系统的原来的厂商、地主和银行老板，集中他们的破坏力量，在国民经济的社会主义部分中制造混乱和无政府状态，阴谋以这种方法破坏作为无产阶级专政基础的工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟。
    人民的敌人使用了极其不同的方法和形式去进行他们的罪恶活动。人民的敌人反对党限制并消灭农村和城市资本主义分子的方针，而执行了他们鼓励并默许资本主义分子的反革命政策。例如，他们把大批的富农划为“中农”，帮助他们逃避缴纳公粮的义务，帮助他们破坏人民民主政权的赋税政策。他们在收购和预订农业产品的时候，非法地抬高价格，这样就使富农和投机商人有了牟取暴利的可能，因为所规定的某些种制成品在农村的售价，是低于生产费用的。他们反对发展农业中的社会主义成分，他们扣压了国营农场在银行中的存款。他们在收税、贷款、预订农业产品和规定价格等方面所执行的异己政策，阻碍了农业的社会主义化。
    异己分子为了破坏社会主义工业化计划，有意地扣压投资资金，特别是对于重工业的投资（重工业是国民经济的关键），并扣压社会主义建设工作的拨款（例如多瑙河—黑海运河工程、“火花报社”大厦工程和其他工程的拨款）。
    在筹备和实行币制改革的期间，这些反革命分子企图散布不满情绪，企图破坏劳动人民对党和政府的信任。在币制改革的前夕，主要工业企业中有许多工人在领取工资的时候收了旧列伊，这应该由这些反革命分子负责。在币制改革以前很久的时候，散布各种挑拨性谣言的，也是他们；他们的目的一方面在于帮助资本主义分子和投机分子逃避币制改革的影响，另一方面在于迷惑群众。
    由于工人阶级和劳动农民在党和以乔治乌—德治同志为首的党中央委员会的领导下进行了有力的斗争，人民的敌人的罪恶活动被揭露和击败了。
    二
    由于卢加所进行的反党、反国家活动，由于卢加的直接支持，混进财政金融系统和合作社系统的异己分子，就得以进行他们的罪恶活动了。卢加丧失了阶级意识，自绝于党和工人阶级，和一帮异己分子勾结在一起，背弃党的总的路线，执行他自己的机会主义路线。卢加成了脱离党的路线的右倾偏向的主要代表，成了机会主义路线的主要传播者。
    卢加自己几年以来在口头上和书面上加以辩解的、同时又在自己的工作方面予以实行的反马克思主义、反列宁主义的路线，使得罗马尼亚社会主义工业化和农村中的社会主义化工作拖延了下来，妨碍了城乡的物资交流，助长了投机生意，破坏了缴纳公粮的计划和收购谷物及其他食品的计划，他这种路线使供应工人阶级和全体劳动人民的工作，受到了重大的损害。
    卢加的机会主义路线脱离了马克思—列宁主义关于阶级斗争的理论，他这种反马克思主义的观点认为：在资本主义过渡到社会主义的阶段内，阶级斗争不是更加尖锐，而是减弱了；资本主义分子可以和平地转入社会主义；国家经济发展的关键不在于社会主义工业化，而在于富农的获得暴利。
    实际上，这种明显的机会主义路线表现在下列这些方面：阻碍制造生产工具的工业的发展、破坏国营农场和集体农场、反对成立并发展农民协会以进行集体耕作、在收购并预订农业产品的时候以市场上的价格为基础而规定价格、在币制改革以前破坏旧列伊的购买力、降低工人阶级的购买力。这种路线使工人阶级和劳动人民的生活水准不能提高到党和政府所预期的程度。
    党关于工人阶级与劳动农民联盟的路线，早在一九四九年三月就已经由乔治乌—德治同志根据列宁—斯大林理论的原则确定下来了，他当时着重地说：“我们对于农民的政策必须明白地确定下来，就是：我们依靠贫农，加强与中农的联盟而对富农进行不断的斗争。”在党内和国家机构中占据重要职位的卢加，违背党的这些指示，以种种的方法帮助并鼓励农村中的资本主义分子，用这种方法打击工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，打击人民民主政权。
    早在一九四九年三月乔治乌—德治同志就在中央委员会全体会议上着重地指出，在目前情况下，合作社的主要意义在于：它们把数以百万计的贫农和中农的私人利益与工人阶级的共同利益结合起来，以便建设社会主义，创造先决条件，使劳动农民更容易地走上社会主义的道路。
    卢加在农民问题上所实行的违背工人阶级和劳动农民的利益的反列宁主义路线，在消费合作社问题上也特别明显地表现了出来，他认为消费合作社这种组织的唯一目的在于将制成品从城市转运到农村。
    身为财政部长的卢加，为了支持反革命分子，他把旧的资产阶级—地主阶级的财政金融系统的机构完整地保留下来；把异己分子、前“西格兰萨”的特务和法西斯分子、过去的地主和资本家提拔到领导职位上来；这种政策是符合他在干部问题上的反党路线的。与我党根据德才选择干部的列宁—斯大林的方针相反，卢加拿专家做幌子将异己分子安插在国家机构内。同时，他还压制批评，打击党员的创造性和积极性，实行腐蚀和歧视忠实于党的事业的干部政策。
    卢加的反党路线并不是偶然的。早在地下活动时期，他就是反党的宗派斗争头子之一。现在不过是他过去的偏向和宗派活动的继续而已。
    党的领导方面曾一再地驳斥卢加的机会主义。但是，卢加采取偏向分子所特有的两面手法，欺骗党，表面上接受党的路线和决定，实际上却坚持他的机会主义路线。
    卢加路线反党反国的性质在准备和实行币制改革的工作中充分地暴露了出来，他不仅采取直接的公开的行动来反对币制改革，而且千方百计地来破坏币制改革。
    中央委员会在五月二十六日到二十七日举行全体会议，决定把卢加从中央委员会中开除出去；并向党的监察委员会对他提出控诉。
    我党向右倾偏向和容忍这种偏向的调和态度发动了坚决的、不可调和的斗争。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：右倾偏向是极端危险的，因为它反映出垂死阶级的顽固分子的抵抗。“右倾机会主义的力量的来源是小资产阶级分子的力量，资本主义分子、特别是富农对党的压力所产生的力量。”（斯大林）
    革命警惕性，党的原则性和在反对右倾倾向、反对一切机会主义动摇性的斗争中的阶级不可调和性，是胜利地建设社会主义的最重要条件。
    三
    卢加之所以能够展开他的反党活动，是因为他得到乔治斯库同志和波克同志的支持和鼓励，他们采取了调和态度，支持脱离党的路线的右倾偏向。
    乔治斯库同志对卢加的右倾机会主义的调和态度掩盖了他自己的右倾机会主义错误，他自己在反对阶级敌人的斗争中缺乏战斗性，在工作中失去了革命警惕性。这样，就使得异己分子可以进行他们的破坏活动。特别重要的是：乔治斯库同志没有对掠夺产业工人和劳动农民的投机分子采取坚决的措施。
    波克同志对卢加所采取的调和态度也掩盖了她自己的错误。她自己曾经在农业问题与公粮问题上脱离党的路线。她的这种偏向表现在她不重视建立新的集体农庄和农业生产合作社，表现在她容忍富农钻进了集体农庄和农业生产合作社，表现在她不关心机器拖拉机站和国营农场，而使异己分子得以钻进拖拉机站和国营农场来。波克同志还犯了脱离党的路线的“左”倾错误。劳动农民参加集体农庄必须是自觉自愿的。而波克同志竟容忍人们破坏这个原则。
    波克在党的领导机构内培养无原则的关系。卢加、波克和乔治斯库三人曾经在一些政治问题上事先商量好了一套。他们瞒着党，暗地里这样做了很长一个时期。这是严重的违反党纪的行为，是企图建立宗派，是违反铁一般的党内团结和党的领导的原则的行为，在马克思—列宁主义的党内，这是完全不许可的。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：
    “问题在于：在对右倾偏向宣战后，右倾偏向分子时常伪装为调和分子，使党陷于为难的地位。为了防止右倾偏向分子的这种诡计，我们必须坚持反对调和态度的坚决斗争。
    这种调和主义倾向肯定地是机会主义的一种形式。这就是说：为了要完全粉碎机会主义，就必须清算对待机会主义的调和态度。根据这点，中央委员会正在动员全党对机会主义的调和倾向进行斗争。
    五月二十六日至二十七日举行的中央委员会全体会议认为乔治斯库同志所作的自我批评是不能令人满意的，因而一致决定撤销他在政治局、组织部和中央委员会书记处的职务，并予以降级处分。
    全体委员会在严厉批评波克同志的错误以后，一致同意给她以警告的处分，并且没有把她选入政治局和党中央委员会书记处。
    由于批评的结果，波克同志承认了她所犯的某些错误，并且向全体会议保证为党的路线和它的决议而斗争。

    中央委员会三月和五月（一九五二年）全体会议的决议证明了罗马尼亚工人党的力量和坚定性。这些决议证明了：党内铁一般的团结和纪律，不是靠掩饰分歧，而是靠揭露和消灭这些分歧，靠对危害党的团结的偏向和调和倾向进行无情的斗争而得来的。作为党的基础的铁一般的布尔什维克纪律，是一切党员和党的领袖必须同样遵守的，包括那些“过去有过贡献”的人和那些在变成“统治者”以后不把执行党的决议当作他们的职责的人。
    大胆展开批评与自我批评是党强有力的表现，而不是脆弱的表现。斯大林同志教导说：“一个党如果不怕批评与自我批评，如果他不掩饰工作中的错误和缺点，如果它从党内工作的错误中吸取教训，用以教育它的干部，如果它懂得如何及时纠正错误，这个党就是不可战胜的党。”
    揭露并消灭我们党内的右倾偏向，对于国内外敌人是个严重的打击，这意味着妨害我国经济繁荣、妨害劳动人民物质与文化生活水准进一步提高的巨大障碍已经排除了。
    布尔什维克党的经验教导说：作为工人阶级先锋队及其战斗总参谋部的党，不能容忍它的队伍中有动摇分子、机会主义分子、投降分子或叛徒存在。如果一个党的队伍里有机会主义分子、投降分子或叛徒，它就不可能对阶级敌人进行生死的斗争。要赢得胜利，工人阶级政党首先就必须清洗各种机会主义分子。清洗机会主义分子可以使党更加强大。
    动员全党对机会主义和对机会主义所抱的调和态度进行斗争，有助于提高党组织、国家机关和群众组织的全部工作的水平，可以使党的意志与行动更加一致，增加党员的责任感和对我国社会主义建设的伟大事业的忠诚。
    可以满怀信心地说：党在群众中的威信提高了，因为人民看到党把劳动人民的利益看得高于一切，它毫不迟疑地对那些危害人民利益的人采取坚决措施，不论他们在党内或国内的地位怎样。
    反对机会主义和对它抱调和的态度的斗争，与加强党的队伍、在政治上与思想上锻炼党员、在党的工作中应用布尔什维克的方法、按照党纪严格遵守党的原则的斗争，有着不可分割的关系。我们必须而且一定要日益深入地实行党内民主、保证动员全体党员参加执行党的马克思—列宁主义路线的斗争。党严厉斥责任何压制批评的行为。党的领导机构必须有计划地检查执行决议的情形，并且向选举他们的党员报告他们的工作。必须以布尔什维克批评与自我批评的精神来讨论这些报告。党组织和全体党员必须不断加强他们和群众的联系——这是党的不可战胜性的保证。
    如果不勤勉地、坚定不移地掌握马克思—列宁主义理论，要想完成党的实际工作是不可能的。只有深切地了解社会主义建设中的经济与政治问题，才能使党员在他们的日常工作中保持正确的方向，并能使他们不致犯错误和产生偏向。
    中央委员会要求党特别注意新的、日渐增多的干部，要求它以高度阶级觉悟的精神，以忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神、以对于脱离党的马克思—列宁主义原则的偏向采取不调和态度的布尔什维克精神来教育他们。这样，将使我们能够实行“一个以不断对资本主义进行进攻为基础的无产阶级政策，建设社会主义的坚定政策。”（乔治乌—德治）
    最近，吸收新党员入党的工作已经恢复了。优秀的工人和农民——农业合作社社员、人民军的指战员、知识分子、优秀的劳动青年联盟盟员请求加入罗马尼亚工人阶级的先锋队，以便更好地为和平与社会主义工作。坚持个别地吸收入党的列宁—斯大林原则和确保党有健全的社会成分，将使党进一步地、更加迅速地强大起来。
    巩固我们的祖国，就是巩固和平阵营，同时也就是削弱帝国主义阵营。我们不能也不应当忘记：美英帝国主义者和他们的右翼社会党分子与铁托分子走狗认为共产党和工人党是妨害他们实现侵略阴谋的重大障碍之一，他们企图利用一切可能削弱党的团结和战斗性的偏向。粉碎右倾偏向对于我们的人民来说，也是争取和平斗争的一大胜利。
    我们紧密地团结在以乔治乌—德治为首的中央委员会周围，不断地向伟大的苏联共产党和全世界劳动人民所敬爱的领袖斯大林同志学习，不断地加强团结和纪律以及与群众的联系，我们的党在将来也必然继续为进一步巩固人民民主政权、为光荣地完成我国建设社会主义伟大事业的组织者和领导者的任务而不断地进行斗争。
