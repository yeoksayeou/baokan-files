Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 17th: According to the New York "Daily Worker" on the 13th, the father of an American soldier from Little Rock, Arkansas, who was captured in Korea, initiated a signature campaign demanding that both sides exchange all prisoners of war. The movement collected one million signatures within thirty days and is continuing to grow. The person who initiated the movement is named Cord, a stonemason contractor whose son, Sergeant Cord, has been a prisoner of war in Korea for over a year.

Cord, based on the lists of exchanged prisoners of war from the American and Korean-Chinese sides, copied down the names and addresses of all the American POWs' parents. He sent each family a petition advocating the immediate exchange of all POWs, along with an explanatory letter, calling on them to collect signatures for the petition and encouraging their friends and neighbors to participate in the movement.

Cord reported last week that "conservatively speaking," approximately nine hundred thousand to one million people have signed the petition and sent it to Washington to Truman and Acheson. He said that people write to him every day reporting that they have sent the signed petitions to Washington, and his mailbox is filled with such letters every day.

Cord said: "This matter is growing like a snowball. To ensure that these petitions are not thrown into the wastebasket, I plan to go to Washington myself in about two weeks."

Cord also said that he received a letter from his captured son, who "said he was doing the right thing."

    美国战俘的父母盼望自己的儿子回家
    征得一百万签名者要求交换全部战俘
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】据纽约“工人日报”十三日报道：美国阿肯色州小石城一位在朝鲜被俘的美国士兵的父亲发动了一个要求双方交换全部战俘的签名运动。运动在三十天内便征集了一百万人的签名，并在继续发展中。发起这个运动的人名叫柯尔德，是一位石工承包者，他的儿子柯尔德中士在朝鲜被俘已经一年多了。
    柯尔德根据美国及朝中方面交换的战俘名单，抄下了全部美国战俘父母的姓名住址，给他们每一个家庭寄了一份主张马上交换全部战俘的请愿书，并附寄一封说明信，号召他们为请愿书征集签名，鼓动他们的朋友和邻居参加这个运动。
    柯尔德在上星期报告说：“保守地说”，现在一共大概有九十万到一百万人签了名，把请愿书寄到华盛顿给杜鲁门和艾奇逊了。他说，人们天天来信向他报告已经把签了名的请愿书寄到华盛顿，他的信箱里每天塞满了这样的信件。
    柯尔德说：“这件事正像滚雪球一样规模愈来愈大。为了保证这些请愿书不致被搁到废纸篓里，我打算大概在两个星期之内亲自到华盛顿去一次。”
    柯尔德又说，他接到他被俘的儿子的来信，他的儿子“说他这样做很对”。
