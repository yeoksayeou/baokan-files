    (2) Those who obey mass supervision, actively participate in labor production, and have been truly reformed;
    (3) Those who actively report counter-revolutionary elements to the people's government and make meritorious service;
    (4) Those who have other meritorious performance in atonement for crimes or special contributions.

    Article 9: The control of counter-revolutionary elements is limited to the person concerned and shall not involve their family members, relatives or friends.
