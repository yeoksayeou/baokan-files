Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: The recovery phase of industrial production in the Northeast will basically conclude this year, and large-scale economic construction, with a focus and in a planned manner, has now begun. Therefore, basic construction has been elevated to the primary position in economic construction. This is a great achievement made by the working class in the Northeast under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee, as well as the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau. It is also a historically significant and major change that has emerged after the Northeast Party correctly implemented the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and shifted the focus of the Party's work from rural areas to cities.

In the past three years, the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau’s leadership of industrial and mining enterprises has focused on restoring and organizing production, while placing the leadership of basic construction in a secondary and subordinate position. In the early days of the Northeast's liberation, more than 80 percent of the equipment in factories and mines suffered severe damage from the enemy, puppet regimes, and the Kuomintang. Within enterprises with colonial characteristics, the old management systems and methods hindered the development of productive forces. In order to restore and organize production, the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau transferred a large number of Party cadres from various work positions to factories and mines to serve as factory directors, managers, and various administrative positions, and to do Party and mass work, learning industrial management.

The leading cadres sent by the Party to industrial departments closely relied on the workers and masses, enabling the restoration of industrial production to develop at an astonishing rate. In the first recovery year of 1949, the speed of recovery of various industrial production volumes exceeded the speed of equipment capacity recovery. At that time, iron smelting equipment was only restored to 25 percent of the highest level during the puppet Manchurian period, while pig iron production reached 42.2 percent of the highest production during the puppet Manchurian period. Spindle equipment was only restored to 66 percent of the highest level during the puppet Manchurian period, while cotton yarn production reached 143 percent of the highest production during the puppet Manchurian period. In 1950, the total output value of factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department increased by 135.6 percent compared to 1949. The number of factories and mines that started operations increased by 34.3 percent compared to the end of 1949, meaning that all factories and mines that could and had to be restored had fully resumed production. In 1951, the total output value of state-owned industries in the Northeast increased by another 24.1 percent compared to 1950. The production volume of various major industries, such as steel, iron, coal, electricity, machinery, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, textiles, paper making, rubber, and glass, mostly approached or exceeded the highest production levels during the puppet Manchurian period when calculated at fixed prices. According to the 1952 Northeast National Economic Plan, the total output value of state-owned industries will increase by another 41.5 percent compared to the total output value of 1951. After the entire plan is realized, the production volume of Northeast industry (including private industry) will exceed the highest level during the puppet Manchurian period by 10 percent. Such a rate of industrial development has never existed in capitalist countries around the world, either in the past or now.

In terms of business management, over the past three years, the production departments in the Northeast have realized preliminary planned management and economic accounting of industrial production through steps such as democratic reform, learning from advanced Soviet experience, and establishing new business management systems. They have also established and strengthened political work in enterprises, transforming the original old enterprises into new people's enterprises. In the process of this transformation, the Party has adopted different specific measures based on the different situations in each period. Immediately after taking over the old enterprises, in order to raise the class consciousness and political awareness of the workers and staff and to restore production as quickly as possible, the factories and mines carried out preliminary democratic reforms of the old enterprises in a step-by-step manner, strengthening the sense of responsibility of the workers and staff as masters of the enterprise and engaging in production with a new labor attitude. However, at that time, production was abnormal, cadres lacked experience in organizing and managing industry, and the phenomenon of waste of manpower and materials became the main problem that existed at that time. In order to solve this problem, the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government launched a mass movement to create new records in the factories and mines in the autumn of 1949, as a central link in implementing anti-waste and implementing economic accounting. In five months, more than 50,000 new record creators emerged. The new record movement broke the so-called "Manchukuo level" and the old "theoretical standards" that were considered impossible to break through, and they began to learn how to formulate new, reasonable quotas, creating favorable conditions for managing production carefully and in a planned manner in the future. In the new record movement, many problems in production organization and management systems were also exposed, the most fundamental and major of which was the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the management system and lax production discipline. Therefore, around February 1950, the Party called on all factories and mines to universally establish a production responsibility system, and to use this to promote production and consolidate the achievements of the new record movement.

The above-mentioned measures mainly focused on solving the problems of production itself. Most factories and mines had not systematically addressed how to rationally use funds in the production process, how to implement cost management and technical management, and how to adopt piece-rate wage systems, resulting in a situation where business management work lagged behind production work. In order to change this situation, the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau convened an industrial work conference in August 1950, determining that the focus should be on improving the business management of industry in order to solve the problems of high costs, low quality, and high waste that existed at that time. After a period of preparation in the factories and mines, a product quality inspection movement was launched at the beginning of 1951. Through this movement, the quality concept of the workers and staff was established, and systems such as technical management were strengthened. On the basis of this movement, in the second half of 1951, a mass production increase and savings movement on an unprecedented scale of five million tons was launched, centered on tapping industrial potential. Through this movement, technical management, financial management, and cost management in various factories and mines were greatly improved, and these management systems began to be promoted to workshops
(pit mouths), making them more in-depth and consolidated. At the same time, many advanced production experiences and advanced working methods were created and learned in the movement, bringing a new atmosphere to improving labor productivity and improving business management. Especially after the great "Three-Anti" movement, the factories and mines cleared out corrupt elements, severely criticized bureaucratic work styles, and the workers and staff drew ideological lines with the bourgeoisie, making the political atmosphere within the enterprises even stronger. Therefore, the various loopholes in the management system that were exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement were gradually plugged with effective measures, further improving the business management of the industry.

On the basis of the industrial production recovery over the past three years, the Northeast region has begun large-scale economic construction with a focus and in a planned manner, and basic construction has been elevated to the primary position.

The proportion of newly built projects in basic industrial construction in the Northeast over the past three years has gradually increased. This change can be clearly seen from the Northeast Industrial Department's use of state investment over the past three years. In addition to using a portion of the funds each year for the cultivation of reserve forces and the welfare of employees, 75 percent was used for restoration projects in 1949, and 25 percent was used for new construction (including renovation, the same below). In 1950, 38 percent was used for new construction projects. In 1951, 80 percent was used for new construction projects. This year, it is planned to use 90 percent for new construction projects. This change in the proportion of investment in new construction projects shows that the development of Northeast industry has shifted from a stage dominated by production recovery to a stage dominated by basic construction. The CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau has recently instructed various industrial administrative departments to transfer a large number of capable cadres, technicians, and skilled workers from the production side to basic construction, under the principle of not affecting production, to enrich and strengthen the existing organizational structure of basic construction, making it the strongest organization in the industrial sector. At the same time, gradually establish various specialized institutions related to basic construction, such as geological exploration, design, finance, material supply, equipment management, labor wages, etc. The Northeast Bureau also instructed all construction enterprises to implement economic accounting systems, promote advanced construction methods and construction experience, and carry out a patriotic production increase and savings movement. Now, all departments are vigorously strengthening leadership over basic construction work in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast Bureau.

    东北工业恢复阶段今年将基本结束
    重点开始大规模经济建设
    基本建设已经提到首要的地位
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北工业生产的恢复阶段今年将基本结束，有重点的有步骤的大规模的经济建设现已开始；因此，基本建设已提到经济建设的首要地位。这是三年来东北工人阶级在毛主席和中共中央以及中共中央东北局的正确领导下所获得的伟大成就；也是东北全党正确执行中共中央二中全会决议，将党的工作重心由乡村转到城市后所出现的有历史意义的重大变化。
    过去三年中，中共中央东北局对工矿企业的领导，重心放在恢复和组织生产方面，而把基本建设的领导放在次要的、从属的地位。当东北解放初期，工厂矿山的设备百分之八十以上遭受了敌伪和国民党的严重破坏；带有殖民地性质的企业内，旧的管理制度和管理方法妨碍着生产力的发展。为了恢复与组织生产，中共中央东北局曾从各种工作岗位上抽调了大批党的干部，到工厂、矿山中去担任厂长、经理以及各种行政职务与做党和群众的工作，学习管理工业。
    党派到工业部门的领导干部，密切依靠职工群众，使工业生产恢复工作一直以惊人的速度发展着。一九四九年第一个恢复年度里，各种工业生产量恢复的速度，就超过了设备能力恢复的速度。当时炼铁设备只恢复到伪满时期最高水平百分之二十五，而生铁的产量则达到伪满时期最高产量百分之四十二点二；纱锭设备只恢复到伪满时期最高水平百分之六十六，棉纱的产量则达到伪满时期最高产量百分之一百四十三。一九五零年东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿的生产总值，比一九四九年增加了百分之一百三十五点六；开工的厂、矿比一九四九年末增加了百分之三十四点三，即所有可能和必须恢复的厂、矿都全部恢复了生产。一九五一年，东北公营工业的生产总值，又比一九五零年增加了百分之二十四点一。各种主要工业，如钢、铁、煤、电、机械、有色金属、化学、纺织、造纸、橡胶和玻璃等的生产量，以固定价格计算，大部分都接近或超过了伪满时期的最高生产水平。按照一九五二年的东北国民经济计划，公营工业的总产值，又将比一九五一年的总产值提高百分之四十一点五。全部计划实现后，东北工业（包括私营工业）的生产量，就可以超过伪满时期最高水平百分之十。这样的工业发展速度，在世界资本主义各国，不论过去或现在都是从未有过的。
    在经营管理工作上，三年来，东北的生产部门，经过民主改革、学习苏联先进经验、建立新的经营管理制度等步骤，已实现了工业生产的初步计划管理和经济核算制，并建立与加强了企业中的政治工作，把原来旧的企业改变成了新的人民的企业。在这种改造过程中，党曾根据各个时期的不同情况，采取了不同的具体措施。刚一接管旧企业后，为了提高职工的阶级觉悟和政治认识，尽快地恢复生产，各厂矿曾有步骤地进行了对旧企业的初步民主改革工作，加强了职工群众主人翁的责任感，以新的劳动态度从事生产。但当时生产不正常，干部缺乏组织和管理工业的经验，人力、物资的浪费现象，成为当时存在的主要问题，为了解决这一问题，中共中央东北局、东北人民政府工业部，就在一九四九年秋发动各厂矿，开展了群众性的创造新纪录运动，作为贯彻反浪费与实行经济核算的中心环节。五个月中，涌现了五万多名新纪录创造者，新纪录运动打破了所谓不可能突破的“伪满水平”和旧的“理论标准”；并开始学到了如何去制定新的合理定额，为以后周密地有计划地管理生产，创造了有利条件。在新纪录运动中，也揭发和暴露了生产组织和管理制度上的许多毛病，其中最根本、最主要的是在管理制度上无人负责，和生产纪律松懈的现象。因此到一九五零年二月间，党便号召各厂、矿普遍建立生产责任制度，并以此来推动生产，巩固新纪录运动的成果。
    上述的这些措施，主要还是集中力量解决生产本身的问题，对于生产过程中如何合理地运用资金，如何实行成本管理与技术管理，如何采行计件工资制度等，大部分厂、矿还没有系统地进行，这就造成了经营管理工作落后于生产工作的局面。为了改变这个局面，中共中央东北局于一九五零年八月召开了工业工作会议，确定以改进工业的经营管理工作为重点，来解决当时存在的成本高、质量低、浪费多等问题。各厂、矿经过一个时期的酝酿，在一九五一年初开展了产品质量大检查运动，通过这个运动树立了职工群众的质量观念，加强技术管理等制度。在这个运动的基础上，一九五一年下半年又以发掘工业潜力为中心，开展空前规模的群众性的五百万吨的增产节约运动。经过这个运动，各个厂矿中的技术管理、财务管理和成本管理工作，都大大提高了一步；并开始把这些管理制度推行到车间
    （坑口），使其更加深入和巩固。同时并在运动中创造与学习了许多的先进生产经验和先进工作方法，为提高劳动生产率和改善经营管理工作带来了新的气象。特别是经过伟大的“三反”运动以后，各厂、矿清除了贪污分子，严厉地批判了官僚主义作风，职工与资产阶级划清了思想界限，使企业内部的政治空气更加浓厚。因此，在“三反”运动中暴露出来的各种管理制度上的漏洞，也都采取有效的措施逐渐加以堵塞，使工业的经营管理工作得到进一步的改善。
    在三年来工业生产恢复的基础上，东北区开始了有重点有步骤的大规模的经济建设，基本建设已提到首要的地位。
    三年来东北工业基本建设中新建工程的比重，是逐渐增加的。从东北工业部三年来对国家投资的使用情况中，可以明显地看出这个变化。工业部除每年将一部分资金用到后备力量的培养和职工福利事业上外，一九四九年用到恢复工程上的是百分之七十五，用到新建（包括改造，下同）工程上的是百分之二十五；一九五零年用到新建工程上的是百分之三十八；一九五一年用到新建工程上的是百分之八十；今年计划用到新建工程上的已达到百分之九十。新建工程投资比重的这种变化，表明东北工业的发展，已由恢复生产为主的阶段进入以基本建设为主的阶段。中共中央东北局最近已指示各工业行政部门，在不影响生产的原则下，从生产方面抽调大批的得力干部、技术人员和技术工人到基本建设中来，充实和加强现有的基本建设的组织机构，使其成为工业部门中最强的机构。同时逐渐建立与基本建设有关的各种专门机构：如地质勘察、设计、财务、材料供应、设备管理、劳动工薪等。东北局并指示各个建筑企业必须实行经济核算制，推广先进的施工方法和施工经验，开展爱国主义增产节约运动。现在，各部门正按照东北局的指示，大力加强对基本建设工作的领导。
