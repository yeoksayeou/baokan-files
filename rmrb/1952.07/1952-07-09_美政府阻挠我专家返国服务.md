Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd (TASS dispatch): The "Compass Daily" published a letter from a young Chinese scientist, who spoke of the unfortunate situation of a large number of Chinese students being forcibly detained by the US government against their will after graduating from American schools. He said: "Many Chinese experts in the United States, especially scientists, are prepared to return to China, knowing that the motherland desperately needs them. Now the US government is doing everything possible to obstruct them from returning home. I myself am a scientist who wanted to leave the US and return to China, but I have not succeeded."
