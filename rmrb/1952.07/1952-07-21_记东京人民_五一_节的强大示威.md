    A Record of the Powerful Demonstration of the People of Tokyo on May Day
    Special article from our newspaper
    On May Day, a grand mass demonstration involving four million people was held in more than 480 locations across Japan, demonstrating the great strength of the Japanese people. In Tokyo, 500,000 people participated in the demonstration. The Yoshida government mobilized 10,000 police officers to implement security measures and directed 5,000 armed police to carry out a frenzied suppression. They used pistols, carbines, and tear gas to attack unarmed demonstrators, resulting in a bloody incident that left nine people dead and more than 500 people injured. As the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out, "The Yoshida government, which manufactured the treasonous treaty, should bear full responsibility for this incident." From this incident, the Japanese people have more clearly recognized the hideous face of the running dogs of American imperialism—the Japanese reactionaries.

    May 1st, the weather in Tokyo was exceptionally clear, with not a cloud in the sky. The wide lawn of Meiji Jingu Gaien Park was a lush green. Japanese workers, farmers, students, citizens, and Korean residents gathered here for a historically significant central rally to celebrate May Day, striving for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy. More than 120 units, totaling 500,000 people, attended. At 8:00 a.m., dozens of red flags had already been erected around the venue, and the sound of majestic songs rose and fell. Colorful flags fluttered in the wind, and the rostrum broadcasted records of "Red Flag," "From the City and the Village," and "Hungarian Dance." First, the workers' teams, carrying banners with neat steps, entered the venue one after another, followed by farmers, students, various political parties, and Korean residents. Flags and banners intertwined. By 10:30 a.m., the number of attendees had reached 400,000, and the meeting began. The central slogans of this conference were: oppose rearmament, break the low-wage system, defend peace with mass struggle, smash the "Administrative Agreement" and the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," and oppose the continued occupation by the United States. The masses cheered enthusiastically, and the shouts of slogans were thunderous. A vast stream of people continued to pour into the venue from all directions. By 11:30 a.m., the number of attendees had reached 500,000, and the venue was extremely crowded. Subsequently, the conference elected a presidium headed by Communist Party member Yoshika Rokukawa, and the conference chairmen successively spoke, calling for opposition to rearmament and the overthrow of the Yoshida government. Then, congratulatory messages from home and abroad were read, and the "May Day" slogans, the smashing of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," and resolutions such as the liberation of the People's Plaza were adopted. What particularly excited people at the conference was the news of the republication of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee's organ, "Red Flag." Thirty thousand copies of the newspaper were snapped up in the venue in less than 45 minutes. The price of a newspaper was five yen, but people were rushing to buy them for ten yen, and some people left fifty yen or one hundred yen and left, which showed their heartfelt love and enthusiastic support for this battle horn of the people. At noon, the masses standing outside the venue, carrying slogans such as "Clark, get out!" and "No American invaders allowed in the venue!" poured into the venue. At this time, the venue both inside and outside shouted the slogan "Take back the People's Plaza," and the conference ended in a climax of passionate excitement.
    This conference should have been held in the People's Plaza in front of the Imperial Palace. The use of the People's Plaza is the people's natural right, but the reactionary Yoshida government, listening to the dictates of its American masters, openly refused the people to use it. Therefore, it aroused the anger of the broad masses. In the afternoon, the parade and demonstration began, and the main force advanced in five routes.
    "To the People's Plaza!" has become the unanimous cry of the participants. Although the Yoshida government had long been prepared and deployed 10,000 armed police in the city, heavily guarded, in an attempt to provoke, it could not stop the iron torrent of the masses. The suffering Japanese people, for seven years, under the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary Japanese government, have accumulated so much anger! The teams set off one after another in a mighty manner. What particularly attracted people's attention was the Korean team, composed of 5,000 people, closely following the student team. They carried a huge portrait of General Kim Il-sung, carrying banners and flags such as "Immediately Stop Germ Warfare." Children aged seven or eight were also mixed in the parade singing the "May Day" song. Listeners were moved and applauded.
    At 12:30, the central route of the parade, with 110,000 people led by the All-Japan Student Federation, sang "The Internationale" and advanced bravely. In front of the Liberal Party headquarters, the parade clashed with the police on guard. The angry masses threw stones and shattered the glass windows of the traitorous staff headquarters - the Liberal Party headquarters building. The National Railway Workers' Union staged a funeral ceremony for the Yoshida Cabinet here. The parade continued to advance. At the Hibiya Park intersection, the parade fought with 100 armed police officers again, and finally broke through the cordon and continued forward! When passing in front of the US military command, the masses were extremely excited and unanimously shouted: "American invaders get out!" The gate of the US military command was tightly closed, and the police fled in panic. In front of Babasakimon, the demonstrators reorganized their ranks and divided into 30 columns to head straight for the People's Plaza. Although the police dispatched armored vehicles, the masses were not afraid. The vanguard entered the People's Plaza and planted red flags next to the Nijubashi Bridge. At this time, 500 policemen in helmets suddenly rushed into the parade and wielded batons. The demonstrators fought back with flagpoles and banners; another team of police used tear gas, and the demonstrators threw stones in response. At that time, there was chaos in front of the People's Plaza, and blood was splattered on the ground. The parade retreated a step, reorganized and continued to confront the police.
    While the central route parade was departing, the southern route parade of 80,000 people also converged with the northern and western route parades and advanced toward the People's Plaza. A conflict occurred in front of the Iwaida Gate with 100 armed police officers. Finally, they repelled the police attack and entered the People's Plaza amidst the applause of the central route parade and the citizens.
    At 3:00 p.m., the central and southern routes of the parade converged in the People's Plaza, and the passion reached its extreme. Slogans were shouted, and the song "The Internationale" was raised high. At this time, the Yoshida government mobilized 5,000 armed police and police reserves to launch a third attack on the demonstrators. A bloody massacre began. Pistols, carbines, and tear gas were fired at the unarmed masses, and batons were wielded wildly in the crowd. Shouts, curses, and screams intertwined, and the People's Plaza was instantly stained with blood. The parade retreated in two routes, and the masses fought back with banners, flagpoles, and stones. On the way back, the angry masses threw five American sailors and Japanese police officers into the moat, burned thirteen American cars, smashed and overturned more than ten American and police cars, and many American military cars had their windows broken. The tramway was on fire, and the smoke filled the US military command building, obscuring the UN flag and the Stars and Stripes hanging on the roof. At 6:00 p.m., the demonstrators gradually dispersed, and the frenzied armed police began attacking the citizens again, causing many casualties.
    By night, what remained in the People's Plaza and on the roads the parade had passed were patches of blood, wooden sticks, rubble, and the wreckage of cars lying on the roadside. The Tokyo May Day parade and demonstration came to an end. The bloody suppression by the Yoshida government cannot scare the Japanese people. May 30th, June 25th, and July 15th, large-scale mass demonstrations were held in various parts of Japan one after another, which is a clear proof. The Japanese people will never forget this blood debt of May 1, 1952.

    记东京人民“五一”节的强大示威
    本报特稿
    “五一”劳动节，日本全国四百八十多个地方，四百万人举行盛大的群众示威运动，显示了日本人民伟大的力量。东京有五十万人参加示威游行，吉田政府出动了一万名警察实行警戒，并指使五千名武装警察进行疯狂镇压。他们使用手枪、卡宾枪、催泪弹向赤手空拳的示威群众进攻，造成了惨死九人，轻重伤五百余人的流血事件。正如日本共产党中央所指出，这次事件的“一切责任，完全应由制造卖国条约的吉田政府来负担”。从这次事件中，日本人民更加清楚地认清了美帝国主义走狗——日本反动派的狰狞面目。
        ×    ×    ×
    五月一日，东京天气格外晴朗，万里无云。明治神宫外苑宽阔的草坪上呈现一片新绿。日本的工人、农民、学生、市民和朝鲜侨民在这里召开了富有历史意义的争取独立、自由、和平、民主的庆祝“五一”节中央大会。到会有一百几十个单位，五十万人。午前八时，会场四周早已竖起了几十面红旗，会场里雄壮的歌声此起彼伏，彩旗迎风招展，主席台上播送着“赤旗”、“来自城市和乡村”、“匈牙利舞曲”等唱片。首先是步伐整齐扛着标语牌的工人队伍陆续进入会场，接着农民、学生、各政党、朝鲜侨民亦相继到会。旗帜和标语牌交织一片。十时半，到会人数已达四十万，大会开始。这次大会的中心口号是：反对重新武装，打破低工资制度，以群众斗争保卫和平，粉碎“行政协定”和
    “防止破坏活动法案”，反对美国继续占领。群众热烈欢呼，口号声浪雷动。广大的人流，仍继续不断地从四面八方拥向会场。到十一时半，到会人数已达五十万，会场拥挤不堪。接着，大会选出了以共产党员细川嘉六为首的大会主席团，大会主席相继讲话，号召反对重新武装和打倒吉田政府；随后，宣读来自国内国外的贺电，通过了“五一”节口号、粉碎“防止破坏活动法案”以及解放人民广场等决议。大会中特别引起人们兴奋的是日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗”报复刊的消息。三万份报纸，在会场里不出四十五分钟即已抢购一空。一份报纸订价五块钱，但人们都是出十块钱争先恐后地买，还有些人丢下五十块钱、一百块钱就走，这表示他们对于这个人民战斗号角的衷心爱戴和热烈支持。中午，扛着“克拉克滚蛋”、“不准美国佬进入会场”等标语牌的站在会场外的群众拥入会场。这时，会场内外高呼“夺回人民广场”的口号，大会在群情激奋的高潮中结束。
    这次大会本应在宫城前的人民广场举行，使用人民广场是人民的当然权利，但反动的吉田政府却听从其美国主子的支使，竟公然拒绝人民使用。因此，激起了广大群众的愤怒。午后，游行示威开始，大队分为五路前进。
    “到人民广场去！”已成为与会群众一致的呼声。虽然吉田政府早已有准备地在市内布置了一万名武装警察，戒备森严，企图挑衅，但却不能阻挡住群众的铁流。苦难的日本人民，七年来，在美帝国主义及其走狗日本反动政府的统治下，是积下了多少愤怒呵！各路队伍相继浩浩荡荡地出发，特别引起人们注意的是紧跟着学生大队前进的由五千人组成的朝鲜人大队，他们抬着金日成将军的巨幅画像，扛着“立即停止细菌战”等标语牌和旗帜，七、八岁的儿童也夹杂在游行队伍中高唱“五一”节歌，听者感动，纷纷鼓掌欢迎。
    十二时三十分，中路十一万人的游行队伍，由全日本学联领先，高唱“国际歌”，勇往前进。在自由党本部门前，游行队伍和担任警戒的警察发生冲突，愤怒的群众投石打碎了卖国参谋部——自由党本部大楼的玻璃窗，国营铁路工会在这里演出了吉田内阁的送葬仪式。游行队伍继续前进。在日比谷公园十字路口，游行队伍又和一百名武装警察发生搏斗，最后终于冲破了警戒线，继续向前！当通过美国驻军司令部门前时，群众异常激奋，一致高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”美国驻军司令部大门紧闭，警察狼狈逃去。在马场先门前，示威群众重整队伍，分成三十路纵队直指人民广场前进。虽然警察出动了装甲汽车，但群众毫不畏惧，先行队伍进入人民广场，在二重桥旁插上了红旗。这时，头戴钢盔的五百名警察突然冲入游行队伍，挥动警棒扑打，示威群众拿起旗杆和标语牌回击；另一队警察使用了催泪弹，示威群众抛掷石块迎击。当时人民广场前一片混乱，地上满溅鲜血。游行队伍后退一步后，重整队伍，继续与警察对峙。
    在中路游行队伍出发的同时，南路八万人的游行队伍也汇合了北路、西路的游行队伍向人民广场前进。在祝田门前和一百名武装警察发生冲突，最后打退了警察的袭击，在中路游行队伍和市民的鼓掌声中进入人民广场。
    午后三时，中、南两路的游行队伍在人民广场汇合了，群情激奋已达极点，口号声四起，“国际歌”声高扬。这时吉田政府调集来五千名武装警察和警察后备队，开始向示威群众进行第三次攻击。血腥的屠杀开始了，手枪、卡宾枪、催泪弹一起向手无寸铁的群众射击，警棍在群众队伍中乱打。喊叫怒骂声音交织一片，人民广场顿为鲜血遍染。游行队伍分成两路后退，群众用标语牌、旗杆和石块反击。在后退路上，愤怒的群众把五名美国水兵和日本警察丢到了濠沟里，烧毁了美国人汽车十三辆，捣毁并推翻了美国人和警察的汽车十多辆，好多美军的汽车被打碎了玻璃窗。电车道上起火了，美国驻军司令部大楼前烟火弥漫，高悬在楼顶上的联合国旗和星条旗已经看不着了。午后六时，示威队伍陆续退散，疯狂的武装警察又开始向市民进攻，造成很多伤亡。
    到了晚上，人民广场和游行队伍所经过的路上剩下的是斑斑的血迹，木棍，碎石和躺在道旁的汽车残骸。东京“五一”节游行示威到此结束了。吉田政府血腥镇压，吓不倒日本人民。五月三十日、六月二十五日、七月十五日，日本各地又先后举行了广大的群众示威运动，就是一个明证。日本人民永远也不能忘记一九五二年五月一日这笔血债。
