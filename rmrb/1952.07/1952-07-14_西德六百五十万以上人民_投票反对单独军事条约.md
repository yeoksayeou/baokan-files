Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th Dispatch from TASS: Over six and a half million people in West Germany have voted against the "General Treaty" and the European Army Treaty signed by the Adenauer government with the United States, Britain, and France, and demanded the conclusion of a just peace treaty with Germany. The press office of the Congress for Promoting Mutual Understanding Among the German People and Striving for a Just Peace Treaty, headquartered in Düsseldorf, announced the above voting situation on the 11th. Its communique also stated that this result shows that Adenauer's actions in signing these treaties and attempting to have the parliament quickly ratify them are completely against the will of the German people. The parliamentarians who support the ratification of these treaties are also violating the will of their voters.

In many cities in West Germany, working people are continuing to struggle against separate military treaties and striving for all countries to conclude a peace treaty with a unified and peace-loving Germany. Youth peace fighters in Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Hamm, and Solingen have held mass demonstrations. The demonstrators' banners were inscribed with the slogan: "Down with Adenauer, against the General Treaty—demand the conclusion of a peace treaty!" Thousands of leaflets were thrown from many houses in Grabeck, calling on the people to exert all their strength to fight against the separate "General Treaty" and strive for all countries to conclude a peace treaty with a unified Germany.

Thirteen thousand unemployed people in Nuremberg demanded that the members of the Bonn parliament not recognize the military treaty concluded by Adenauer with Western countries and advocated a peaceful solution to the German question. The resolution of the Unemployed Committee to the members of the Bonn parliament stated: We believe that the shameful treaties concluded in Paris and Bonn will bring extremely serious consequences to the German people. Now is the time to conclude a just peace treaty with Germany, a treaty that will ultimately bring work and bread to us unemployed.

    西德六百五十万以上人民
    投票反对单独军事条约
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德已有六百五十万以上的人民，投票反对阿登纳政府与美英法三国签订的“一般性条约”和欧洲军条约，并要求缔结公正的对德和约。总部在杜塞尔多夫的促进德国人民相互了解与争取缔结公正和约大会的新闻处十一日发表了上述投票情况，它的公报并说，这个结果表明：阿登纳签订并企图使议会迅速批准这些条约的行动，是完全违反德国人民的意志的。赞成批准这些条约的议员也是违反他们的选民的意志的。
    在西德的许多城市中，劳动人民正在继续斗争，反对单独军事条约，争取各国与一个统一的、爱好和平的德国缔结和约。杜塞尔多夫、多特蒙德、哈姆和索林根的青年和平战士都举行了群众示威。示威者的旗帜上写着下面的口号：“打倒阿登纳，反对一般性条约——要求缔结和约！”从格拉贝克的许多房屋中抛下了数以千计的传单，要求人民拿出全部力量进行反对单独的“一般性条约”、争取各国与一个统一的德国缔结和约的斗争。
    纽伦堡的一万三千名失业者要求波恩议会议员不承认阿登纳与西方国家缔结的军事条约，并主张和平解决德国问题。失业者委员会致波恩议会议员的决议说：我们认为在巴黎和波恩缔结的可耻的条约将给德国人民带来极严重的后果。现在是缔结一个公正的对德和约的时候了，这样的和约最后会给我们失业者带来工作和面包。
