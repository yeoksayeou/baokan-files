Has Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Reached its Limit?
——A Record of the Dalian Chemical Plant's Liu Zhao Work Section's Planning Process for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
Youth League, Dalian City Committee Deputy Secretary Ding Zhemin

    Last year, the Liu Zhao work section of the second workshop of the Dalian Chemical Plant, in addition to completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule, increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to 5,243 tons of grain. From January to May of this year, it again increased production and practiced economy for the country, saving 3.026 billion yuan, equivalent to 4,645 tons of grain. Therefore, it was rewarded twice by the Lüda Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and also received awards from the Northeast Industrial Department and commendation from Comrade Gao Gang.
    In May of this year, Comrade Gao Gang issued a call to the working class of Northeast China to increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to 8 million tons of grain. Under the leadership of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League, the workers of the Liu Zhao work section also studied Comrade Gao Gang's report and the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. However, in chats and discussions, a common misconception was exposed. That is, they believed: "Last year, we increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to more than 5,000 tons of grain. This year, to increase the quota by 10% on the basis of last year's increase in production and economy is already quite difficult!" "The potential has been exhausted, and the tricks have been found!" "The production quota has been increased, and the increase in production and economy has reached its limit!" Therefore, they developed a sense of weariness towards the movement to increase production and practice economy: "One movement follows another, how much more can we do?" "I originally planned to take a break, but the movement is here again, alas! There is no end!"
    After the leaders of the work section discovered the above situation, they believed that this was an important ideological obstacle in the movement to increase production and practice economy. After analysis and research, they believed that these misconceptions arose because the workers lacked sufficient understanding of the significance and favorable conditions for the movement to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, through the Party's group meetings, Youth League branch meetings (absorbing young workers to participate), administrative work section meetings, and trade union group meetings, they conducted political education on the workers on increasing production and practicing economy, explaining the benefits of increasing production and practicing economy to the country and individuals, and pointing out the four favorable conditions for the work section to increase production and practice economy.
    Next, they calculated the big picture and the detailed accounts for the workers, so that the workers could specifically understand the significance of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, technician Chen Yiying calculated a detailed account of the production capacity of the blower and found that the blower had an idling phenomenon. If the idling phenomenon was overcome, it would increase production and save 12 million yuan for the country every day. If the time for each coal unloading was shortened by one second, it could increase production and save 12.9 million yuan by the end of the year. The workers said in surprise: "Time is gold, one second is worth so much money!" Therefore, they put forward a guarantee of not wasting a minute or a second.
    After that, they conducted "six checks": check output, check quality, check potential, check ideology, check causes, and check key factors, and conducted actual inspections of output and potential. For example, among the three shifts in the entire work section, due to different operating methods, the output also varied. Youth League member Song Dianmou, because of good operation, produced 100 cubic meters more of water gas per ton of coke than other shifts. If the other two shifts used his method, they could increase production and save the country 567 million yuan annually. In terms of quality, the quality of Li Shusen's shift has always been 1% to 3% higher than other shifts. If the "Li Shusen Quality Balance Method" was promoted in the other two shifts, it could increase production and save the country 141 million yuan annually.
    After everyone's discussion, a comparison of good and bad, high and low was conducted, and experiences were exchanged. A total of five key factors for increasing production and practicing economy were found: increasing air volume, reducing the cycle time from three minutes to two and a half minutes, which could increase production by 600 million yuan by the end of the year; balancing the large steam flow can avoid waste and improve output and quality; if the waste gas carbon monoxide can be recovered, it is estimated that about 2 billion yuan can be saved this year; implementing softening operations to save water; improving dust collectors and shortening coal unloading time can save about 600 million yuan a year.
    In the process of formulating the plan, the situation in this work section completely changed: from a lack of confidence in increasing production and practicing economy to a mass movement to tap potential, find tricks, put forward rationalization proposals, improve operations, and promote advanced experience. The workers' confidence in increasing production and practicing economy has been improved. They said: "Tricks can't be found to the end, potential can't be exhausted; there are tricks everywhere, everyone taps potential."

    增产节约到顶了吗？
    ——记大连化学厂刘钊工段订增产节约计划的经过
    青年团旅大市委副书记    丁哲民
    大连化学厂第二车间刘钊工段，去年在提前完成全年生产计划以外，增产节约了价值五千二百四十三吨粮食的财富。今年一月到五月，又给国家增产节约了三十亿二千六百余万元，折合粮食四千六百四十五吨。因此曾受到旅大市人民政府和市总工会的两次奖励，又受到东北工业部的奖励和高岗同志的嘉勉。
    今年五月间，高岗同志向东北工人阶级发出增产节约价值八百万吨粮食财富的号召。刘钊工段工人，在党、行政、工会、青年团的领导下，也学习了高岗同志的报告和中共中央东北局的指示。可是在漫谈和讨论中，却暴露了一种普遍存在的错误思想。那就是认为：“去年增产节约了价值五千多吨的财富，今年在去年增产节约的基础上，提高定额百分之十。已经够呛了！”“潜力挖完了，窍门找尽了！”“生产定额提高了，增产节约到顶点了！”因而对增产节约运动发生了一种厌倦的情绪：“运动一个接着一个，多?到头哪？”“我本打算歇一歇，运动又来了，唉！反正没个头！”
    工段领导同志发现以上情况后，认为这是增产节约运动中的重要思想障碍，经过分析研究，认为产生这些错误思想，是由于工人对增产节约运动的意义和有利条件认识不足。于是，通过党的小组会，团支部大会（吸收青年工人参加），行政工段会、工会小组会，对工人进行增产节约政治教育，说明增产节约对国家及个人的好处，指出工段增产节约的四个有利条件。
    接着，又向工人们算大账和算细账，使工人们具体认识增产节约的意义。例如技术员陈以英把鼓风机的生产能力算了一个细账，发现鼓风机有空转的现象，如果克服空转现象，每天就为国家增产节约一千二百万元。如果把每次下炭的时间缩短一秒钟，到年底即可增产节约一千二百九十万元。工人们吃惊地说：“时间是黄金，一秒钟能值这么多的钱啦！”因而提出不浪费一分钟一秒钟的保证。
    之后，又进行“六查”：查产量、查质量、查潜力、查思想、查原因、查关键，对产量和潜力进行了实际检查。如全工段中有三个班，由于操作方法的不同，产量也各有高低。团员宋殿谋，因操作的好，每吨焦炭比别班的多出一百立方米水煤气。如果其他两班都用他的方法，每年可给国家增产节约五亿六千七百余万元。在质量上，李树森班的质量一直比别班的高百分之一到百分之三，如果其他两班都推广了“李树森质量平衡法”，每年可给国家增产节约一亿四千一百余万元。
    经过了大家讨论，进行了好坏高低的对比，互相交流经验，共找出了增产节约的五大关键：加大风量，把循环时间从三分钟减少到二分半钟，到年底可增产六亿元；使大蒸气流量平衡，可以避免浪费，并可提高产量与质量；如果能回收废气一氧化碳，估计今年可节省二十亿元左右；实行软化操作，节省用水；改进除尘器，缩短下炭时间，一年可节省六亿元左右。
    在订计划过程中，这个工段的情况完全变了：由对增产节约信心不高，转变为挖潜力，找窍门，提合理化建议，改进操作，推广先进经验的群众运动。工人们对增产节约的信心提高了。他们说：“窍门找不尽，潜力挖不完；处处有窍门，人人挖潜力。”
