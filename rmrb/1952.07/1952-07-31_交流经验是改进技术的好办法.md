    Exchanging Experiences is a Good Way to Improve Technology
    To the Editor: Some time ago, I participated in a summer vacation for coal mine labor models in Beidaihe. While recuperating, we exchanged production experiences. The speeches of labor models from various places gave me great inspiration. We coal mine workers have a low level of education. When others explain advanced experiences, we understand them clearly, but if they are printed on paper for us to read, it becomes a difficult task. Every time we see the names of Ma Liuhai and Cui Guoshan in the newspaper, we sincerely admire them, but we can't explain exactly how they do it. This time, advanced producers from various brother mines came together, each explaining their own experiences. It sounded clear and specific, like visiting the working face in person. As the saying goes, "Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang." If you have a little innovation and I have a little experience, some of which may be sporadic, but when integrated using the Kovalev method, it becomes a very good experience. Therefore, I think exchanging experiences is the most important thing for improving technology. If we don't organize experience exchanges and rely solely on a few people working on the working face, it will take an indefinite amount of time to create an experience. This experience exchange also made me feel that potential power can never be fully tapped, and tricks are everywhere, just afraid of not looking for them. Many innovations, once explained, seem very simple, but before people said them, we didn't think of them ourselves. The tricks are like a piece of paper separating us; once you poke it, it goes right through. But if you don't poke it, you'll never see it.

    交流经验是改进技术的好办法
    编辑同志：前些日子我在北戴河参加了煤矿劳动模范的暑期休养。我们一边休养一边交流生产经验，各地劳动模范的发言，给了我很大的启发。我们煤矿工人文化水平低，很多先进经验别人给讲时也听得满清楚，要是印到纸上让看，可就是件难事。我们每一看见报纸上登着马六孩、崔国山的名字，真是打心眼里羡慕，可是人家究竟是怎么搞的，我们就说不出名堂来。这一次各兄弟矿的先进生产者都来到一块，各自讲解自己的经验，听起来又清楚又具体，就像亲自去工作面上参观了一次一样。俗话说“三个臭皮匠凑成个诸葛亮”，你有一点创造，我有一点经验，有些也许是零星的，但是用郭瓦廖夫工作法一综合，就成了很好的经验。因此我觉得交流经验对于改进技术来说是一件最重要的事情。要是不组织经验交流，单靠几个人在工作面上干，不定得多长时间才能创造出一条经验来。这一次的交流经验还使我感觉到，潜在力量总也挖不完，窍门到处有，就怕不找。这次就有很多创造一讲出来觉得很简单，可是人家没说出来以前自己就没想起来。窍门和我们就像隔着一张纸，一扎就透了。可是，要是不扎它，就永远也看不见。
