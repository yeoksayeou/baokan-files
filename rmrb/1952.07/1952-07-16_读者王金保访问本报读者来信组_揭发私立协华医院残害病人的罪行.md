Reader Wang Jinbao Visits the People's Daily Readers' Letters Group
Exposes the Crimes of Private Xiehua Hospital in Harming Patients

On June 11th, reader Wang Jinbao visited the People's Daily Readers' Letters Group to expose the evil deeds of the private Xiehua Hospital (mental hospital) in Beijing in illegally exploiting and harming patients. Subsequently, Wang Jinbao continued to conduct multi-faceted investigations and research on the situation of Xiehua Hospital and continued to provide materials to this newspaper. This newspaper contacted relevant authorities multiple times and convened two investigation meetings, proving that the situation reflected by Wang Jinbao was indeed true. Now, Wang Jinbao's several conversations are compiled and published below, and relevant authorities are requested to investigate and deal with them promptly.

The People's Daily "Readers' Letters" column on May 18th published my letter exposing the exploitation of patients by the private Xiehua Hospital (mental hospital) in Beijing and the beating of patients by the hospital's nursing staff, and also published the self-criticisms of two nurses in the hospital who beat patients. However, on May 23rd, nurses Gao Yongxiang and others from the hospital tied patient Zhong Zhang to the bed and brutally beat Zhong Zhang's head with their fists. According to the materials I investigated among the workers in the hospital, as well as the materials confirmed with the hospital负责人, the situation of harming and illegally exploiting patients in the hospital is very serious. I want to further expose the various illegal acts of the hospital, and I hope that relevant authorities will inspect the hospital.

The hospital's nursing staff consistently abuse patients. I will only cite a few prominent examples here. On March 18th of this year, nurses He Zhiyong, Zhou Fuzhen, Tian Shoumian, and Xia Zengyi brutally beat patients Zhang Zhijian, Gong Yuncheng, and Zheng Fangkun. Gong Yuncheng was beaten to the point of bleeding from his mouth and nose. He Zhiyong used a bamboo pole to brutally beat Zhang Zhijian, breaking the pole in the process. A female nurse, Peng Xiuying, disliked a female patient for shouting, so she tied the patient to the bed and covered the patient's head with a quilt, and she herself lay down on the patient's head to sleep. When others discovered it, the female patient had been suffocated and passed out, and only survived after being rescued by a doctor. I once questioned Gao Yuhua, the founder and current vice president of the hospital, and he also admitted that "beating patients is historical in Xiehua Hospital." Many of the hospital's nursing staff are hired by the hospital at the "human market." The hospital裁人 or hires people from the "human market" at any time according to the number of inpatients. After this group of people are hired into the hospital, the hospital does not conduct education on nursing knowledge, so it is natural for the nursing staff to hit people.

Why has the situation of abuse of patients by the hospital's nursing staff been able to exist for a long time? This is inseparable from the hospital's management method of only caring about making money and not caring about the lives of patients.

The hospital has six or seventy inpatients, and dozens of patients come to the clinic every day; however, there are only three doctors, including院长 Wu Fayu, and one of them is not always in the hospital. After many patients are admitted to the hospital, they do not receive treatment for a long time. On June 21st and 22nd, five patients were admitted to the hospital, and it has been almost twenty days now, but the hospital does not treat them, only letting the nurses give them sleeping pills and injections every night. If the patients make noise, the hospital will let them sleep on a "protective bed" (a bed with equipment for tying people). For example, patient Niu Zongfan has been in the hospital for a month and a half and has not received treatment. On July 5th, his illness broke out, and the hospital just tied him to the "protective bed" and considered it done. The hospital's so-called treatment is only to use "electroshock" or inject "insulin" when the patient has an attack, so that the patient will not make noise temporarily ("electroshock" is a method of using electric current to cause the patient to have spasms. After this method is performed, the patient is extremely tired for several days in a row, so they have no strength to make noise. This is very destructive to the patient's nervous function. Injecting "insulin" can reduce the patient's blood sugar and cause them to fall into a coma; too many injections will damage the patient's physiological functions), instead of fundamentally treating the patient. Therefore, the hospital's treatment effect is very poor. Patient Wang Longwen has been in the hospital for two and a half years, and Wang Laixiu has been in the hospital for two years, and their conditions have not improved at all. Even worse, in order to make more money or prevent patients from making noise, the hospital abused "electroshock," "treating" some patients with originally mild conditions into idiots. Patients Li Huaifa and Sun Xuetang are like this. What is especially intolerable is that the hospital is extremely irresponsible in its work, resulting in fatal accidents. Female patient Zheng Yuelang was admitted to the hospital on June 17th. When she was admitted to the hospital, she was otherwise normal except for mental disorder (talking non-stop day and night). On the afternoon of the 23rd, the patient had a high fever of 40.3 degrees Celsius. The nurse reported the condition to the doctor, but the doctor mistakenly thought it was malaria. On the afternoon of the 24th, the patient's temperature rose to 41.3 degrees Celsius, and the situation was extremely dangerous. At this time, the hospital determined that the patient had turned into pneumonia and wanted to push it off. At half past ten that night, the hospital transferred the patient to the Army Hospital. The Army Hospital's rescue was ineffective, and the patient died at five past eleven. Xiehua Hospital should take full responsibility for this incident.

Below, I will also expose the illegal acts of the hospital in exploiting patients by various despicable and shameless means.

Most of the patients admitted to the hospital are mentally unsound. Gao Yuhua, the hospital's负责人, and his agent Tian Zhixiang take advantage of this to create fake drug bills on a large scale. In the "Five-Anti" movement, they initially admitted that the illegal income from making fake drug bills was over 100 million, and later admitted that 80% of the drug costs were fake. The hospital's drug prices are much higher than market prices. For example, 200 units of insulin are priced at around 100,000 yuan (reduced to around 80,000 after the "Five-Anti" movement), and each bottle of oil-based penicillin is priced at 180,000 yuan (reduced to 130,000 yuan after the "Five-Anti" movement). In the "Five-Anti" movement, I also discovered that nurse Zhang Zhanyuan of the hospital used 25% glucose to pretend to be 50% glucose and injected it into patient Yu Nanxiang. In June, the hospital also used cheaper "ephedrine tablets" to replace the more expensive "codeine" for me to take.

In terms of patient meals: Before the "Five-Anti" movement, the monthly food cost for patients was 270,000 yuan, but they ate cabbage and bean sprouts every day, and the portions were very small. In December last year, patients also ate third-class noodles for more than a month. At the beginning of January this year, patients ate sweet potatoes for lunch for three consecutive days. This is because Gao Yuhua, his agent Tian Zhixiang's whole family, and their relatives and friends all ate the patients' meals and ate much better than the patients. Fifteen employees who should have their meals provided by the hospital also ate the patients' meals. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the monthly food cost for patients was reduced to 210,000 yuan, and the quality was also improved.

In addition, in the "Five-Anti" movement, employees also exposed the hospital's负责人 for crimes such as exploiting patient care fees, bribing cadres, and attempting to usurp the leadership of the trade union. However, relevant authorities have not yet dealt with the hospital's problems.

I believe that the criminal acts of Xiehua Hospital in illegally exploiting and harming patients are intolerable. In order to protect the health of patients, I suggest that relevant authorities conduct a thorough inspection of the hospital as soon as possible and give the hospital's负责人 the punishment they deserve in accordance with the law.

    读者王金保访问本报读者来信组
    揭发私立协华医院残害病人的罪行
    六月十一日，读者王金保访问本报读者来信组，揭发北京市私立协华医院（精神病院）非法剥削病人、残害病人的罪恶行为。其后，王金保继续对协华医院的情况，进行多方面的调查研究，继续向本报提供材料。本报多次和有关机关进行联系，并且召集了两次调查会，证明王金保反映的情况是确实的。现在把王金保的几次谈话综合发表如下，请有关机关迅速调查处理。
    五月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了我检举北京市私立协华医院（精神病院）院方剥削病人和该院护理员殴打病人的来信，同时登载了该院两个殴打病人的护理员的检讨。但是，五月二十三日，该院护理员高永祥等两人，又把病人仲章捆在床上，用拳头毒打仲章的头部。根据我在该院工人中调查的材料，以及和院方负责人对证的材料，证明该院残害病人、非法剥削病人的情况是十分严重的。我要进一步揭发该院的各种不法行为，希望有关机关对该院进行检查。
    该院护理员一贯地虐打病人。我在这里只举几个比较突出的例子。今年三月十八日，护理员何志勇、周福祯、田寿棉、夏增宜四人毒打病人张志坚、宫云成、郑方坤三人。宫云成竟被打得嘴鼻流血。何志勇用一根竹杆毒打张志坚，竟把竹杆都打断了。女护理员彭秀英嫌一个女病人吵叫，竟把病人捆在床上，用棉被压住病人的头部，她自己躺在病人头上睡觉。当别人发觉时，这个女病人已被压得昏过去了，经大夫急救才活过来。我曾质问过该院创办人、现任副院长高玉华，他也承认“打病人在协华医院是有历史性的”。该院很多护理员都是院方在“人市”上雇来的，院方根据住院病人的多寡，随时裁人或到“人市”上雇人。这批人被雇入院后，院方并不进行护理常识的教育，因此，护理员打人就是很自然的事了。
    为什么该院护理员虐打病人的情况能够长期存在呢？这和该院院方只管赚钱、不管病人死活的经营方法是分不开的。
    该院共有住院病人六、七十人，每天还有几十个病人来门诊；但医生只有院长武法堉等三人，其中有
    一个还不是经常在该院的。很多病人入院后，长期得不到治疗。六月二十一、二日，有五个病人入院，至今已快二十天了，但院方不予治疗，只是在每天晚上，让护理员给他们吃安眠药、打安眠针。病人如果吵闹起来，院方就让病人睡“保护床”（一种有捆人设备的床）。如病人钮宗烦，入院一个半月，没有得到治疗。七月五日，他的病发作起来，院方把他捆在“保护床”上就算完事了。该院的所谓治疗，仅仅是在病人发病时，使用“电休克”或注射“因素林”（胰岛素），使病人暂时不再吵闹（“电休克”是一种运用电流使病人发生痉挛现象的办法。施行这种方法后，病人连续几天极端疲乏，因此就无力吵闹了。这对病人的神经机能的摧残是很严重的。注射“因素林”可使病人的血糖减少而陷于昏睡状态；注射数过多，会损害病人的生理机能），而不是从根本上进行治疗。因此，该院的治疗效果很坏。病人王龙文入院已两年半，汪来秀入院已两年，病况丝毫没有好转。更恶劣的是：该院为了多赚钱，或使病人不能吵闹，竟滥用
    “电休克”，把有些病情本来不重的病人“治”成了傻子。像病人李怀发、孙学堂就是这样。尤其不能容忍的是该院在工作中极端不负责任，以致发生了死亡事故。女病人郑月朗，六月十七日入院。入院时除精神失常（昼夜不停地说话）外，其他方面都还正常。二十三日下午，病人发高烧至摄氏四十点三度。护士把病况报告给大夫，大夫竟错误地认为是疟疾。二十四日下午，病人体温升到摄氏四十一点三度，情况极端危险。该院这时断定病人已转成肺炎，就想推出了事。当夜十时半，该院把病人转送陆军医院。陆军医院抢救无效，病人在十一时五分身死。对于这个事件，协华医院应负完全
    责任。
    以下，我还要揭发该院用种种卑鄙无耻的手段剥
    削病人的非法行为。
    该院收容的病人，大多数神智不清。院方高玉华及其代理人田致祥就利用这一点，大造假药费单。在“五反”运动中，他们起初承认造假药单非法所得在一亿以上，后来又承认药费中百分之八十是假的。该院药品价格要比市价高很多。如因素林二百单位开价十万元左右（“五反”后已降为八万左右），油质盘尼西林每瓶开价十八万（“五反”后已降为十三万元）。在“五反”运动中，我还发现该院护理员张占元用百分之二十五的葡萄糖假充百分之五十的葡萄糖，给病人于南祥注射。六月份，院方还用价格较低的“麻黄素片”充当价格较高的
    “寇丁”给我服用。
    在病人伙食方面：“五反”前病人每月伙食费是二十七万元，但每天吃的是白菜、豆芽，而且分量极少。去年十二月，病人还吃了一个多月的三等面。今年一月初，病人连续三天午饭都吃白薯。这是因为高玉华及其代理人田致祥全家，和他们的来往亲友，都吃病人的伙食，并且吃得比病人好得多的缘故。应该由院方供给伙食的十五个职工，也吃病人的伙食。经过“五反”运动，病人伙食费每月降为二十一万元，质量也提高了。
    此外，在“五反”运动中，职工还揭发该院院方有剥削病人护理费、贿赂干部、企图篡夺工会领导权等罪行。但是，有关机关至今还没有处理该院的问题。
    我认为：协华医院非法剥削病人、残害病人的罪恶行为，是令人不能容忍的。为了保障病人健康，我建议有关机关迅速对该院进行彻底检查，并且依法给该院院方以应得的惩处。
