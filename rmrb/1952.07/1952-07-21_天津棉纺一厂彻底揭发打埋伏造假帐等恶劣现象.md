    The state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, while criticizing bourgeois ideology in its operational management, thoroughly exposed the phenomena of management and technical personnel lying dormant in their work and creating false accounts, creating the necessary preconditions for future production reforms.
    This phenomenon is manifested in all aspects. First, in order to show off personal or departmental achievements, management and technical personnel do not hesitate to lie dormant and create false accounts to deceive superiors. For example, the actual loom operating rate of this factory has reached 99.6 percent, and the actual spinning machine operating rate has reached over 99 percent. However, when the planning department made plans, it only set the loom rate at 99 percent and the spinning machine rate at 97.5 percent, so that it would be easy to complete the plan and show an increase in output. The maintenance department actually only needs a few hours to level a car, but reports it as a day; sometimes there is no small levelling car, but it is still reported. The management personnel of the weaving workshop used the habit that zero-length cloth was not included in the output figures, deliberately reported the zero-length cloth as large and the first-class cloth rate as small, in order to bury a portion of the first-class cloth, and then take it out to make up for it when the plan could not be completed in a certain month. The planned output of cloth in the first quarter of this year was completed in this way. Secondly, in order to catch up with tasks, management and technical personnel also find ways to deceive workers. For example, in January and February of this year, the first weaving workshop failed to complete its plan. Instead of mobilizing the workers to study the reasons so as to improve efficiency from the improvement of technology and management, the workshop director asked the workers to start the machines early and turn them off late to solve the problem. They said to the workers: "You turn off the machines too quickly. You should turn them off one by one. After turning off one machine, level the heddle once, and the shuttle will not get stuck when you start the machine again." They even said that this was stipulated in the 1951 weaving method.
    This evil phenomenon has caused great losses to production management and has also created a very abnormal state of labor and life for the workers. The result of starting the machines early and turning them off late has greatly shortened the workers' rest time, damaged their health, and reduced the attendance rate from over 90 percent to about 80 percent. Management and technical personnel do not pay attention to the advanced production experience of the workers. Han Peizhen, a roving worker in the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, only produced two hard rovings in half a year and has very good working experience, but the technical personnel did not summarize and promote it. When the fine yarn workers in the factory promoted the Hao Jianxiu working method, half of them were perfunctory. Li Baocai, a cloth field worker, researched a working method of installing shuttles without returning silk, but the workshop director did not pay attention to it, and as a result, this working method was not improved.
    During the "Three-Anti" movement this year, after the workers' work of anti-corruption, checking waste, and carefully calculating accounts was carried out in depth, these evil phenomena were largely exposed, awakening the leading cadres, and focusing on ideologically criticizing the bad work style of the management and technical personnel, while also criticizing the bureaucracy of the leading cadres. In order to gradually overcome the shortcomings of "not knowing what's in mind" in operational management, the factory's leadership has made a preliminary and correct measurement of the factory's production capacity when mobilizing workers to formulate increase production and practice economy plans, and organized workers to establish original records in groups, laying the foundation for establishing a correct statistical system. Some unreasonable operational management systems in the factory are also being studied and improved.

### 天津棉纺一厂彻底揭发打埋伏造假帐等恶劣现象

    天津棉纺一厂彻底揭发打埋伏造假帐等恶劣现象
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂在批判经营管理工作中的资产阶级思想时，彻底揭发了管理人员和技术人员工作上的打埋伏造假帐的现象，给今后的生产改革工作创造了必要的前提条件。
    这种现象表现在各方面，首先是管理人员和技术人员为了显示个人的或本单位的成绩，竟不惜打埋伏、造假帐来欺骗上级。例如这个厂的布机运转率实际已达百分之九十九点六，纱机运转率实际已达百分之九十九以上，但计划科做计划时，却只把布机订为百分之九十九，纱机订为百分之九十七点五，以便容易完成计划，显示产量的提高。保全部门平揩一台车实际只要几小时，却报成一天；有时没有小平车，也报了小平车。织布车间的管理人员利用零布不计入产量数字的习惯，故意把零布报大、正布率报小，以便埋伏一部分正布，到某一月份计划完成不了时就拿出来补上。今年第一季度布的计划产量就是这样完成的。其次，管理人员和技术人员为了赶任务，还想办法来欺骗工人。例如今年一、二月份，织布第一车间没有完成计划，车间主任不去发动工人群众研究原因，以便从改进技术、改进管理上来提高效率，却叫工人早开车、晚关车，来解决问题。他们对工人说：“你们关车太快，应该一部一部地关，关一部车，平一次综，再开车时就不会卡梭子。”他们甚至说：这是一九五一织布工作法里规定的。
    这种恶劣现象，使生产管理工作遭受很大损失，也使工人群众的劳动生活形成一种很不正常的状态。早开车、晚关车的结果，使工人休息时间大为缩短，身体健康受到损害，出勤率竟由百分之九十以上降低到百分之八十左右。管理人员和技术人员们对工人群众中的先进生产经验是不重视的。第一棉纺织厂粗纱工人韩佩珍半年内只出两个硬粗纱，有很好的工作经验，但技术人员却不去总结推广。厂里细纱工人在推行郝建秀工作法时，有一半流于形式。布场工人李宝才研究出装梭不出回丝的工作法，但车间主任不重视，结果这一工作法没有得到提高和改进。
    今年“三反”运动中，工人们反贪污、查浪费、算细帐的工作深入展开后，才大量暴露了这些恶劣现象，使领导干部惊醒过来，并着重从思想上批判了管理人员和技术人员的这一不良作风，同时批判了领导干部的官僚主义。为了逐步克服在经营管理工作上 “心中无数”的缺点，厂的领导方面已在发动工人订立增产节约计划时，对全厂生产能力做了初步正确的测定，并组织工人在小组内建立原始记录，为建立正确的统计制度打下基础。厂内一些不合理的经营管理制度也正在研究改进。
