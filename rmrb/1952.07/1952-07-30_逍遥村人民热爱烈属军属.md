    The People of Xiaoyao Village Love the Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel

    To the Editor: Xiaoyao Village is a well-known high-yield village in Jianhu County, Northern Jiangsu, and also a "high-yield village for military families." Under the education of the Communist Party, the political awareness of the people in the whole village has been unprecedentedly improved. They give due respect and care to the parents of the seventeen outstanding sons who have devoted themselves to defending the motherland—the families of martyrs and military personnel. The whole village is composed of 170 people who have formed thirteen contracting teams. Under the goal of "achieving high yields for military families," they actively and timely farm on behalf of the families of martyrs and military personnel. In 1951, the yield per mu of the fields of the families of martyrs and military personnel had exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The 1952 plan for farming on behalf of and achieving high yields aims to increase the total output of all 92 mu of land farmed on behalf of them to 41,815 jin, an increase of 9,000 jin compared to 1951. The love of the people of the whole village for the families of martyrs and military personnel has become a habit. None of the houses of the families of martyrs and military personnel are in disrepair, and eleven children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers have been enrolled in school.

    逍遥村人民热爱烈属军属
    编辑同志：逍遥村是苏北建湖县的一个有名的丰产村，也是一个“军属丰产村”。全村人民在共产党的教育下，政治觉悟空前提高，对献身于保卫祖国的十七名优秀男儿的父母——烈属、军属，给予了应有的尊敬和照顾。全村以一百七十人组成了十三个包工组，在“为军属丰产”的目标下，适时而积极地为烈属、军属代耕。一九五一年，烈属、军属的田每亩产量已超过了抗日战争前的水平。一九五二年的代耕丰产计划，要把全部代耕的九十二亩多田的总产量提高到四万一千八百十五斤，比一九五一年增产九千斤。全村人民对烈属、军属的热爱已成为一种习惯。烈属、军属的住房已没有一所坏房，革命烈士和革命军人的子女，已有十一人入学。
