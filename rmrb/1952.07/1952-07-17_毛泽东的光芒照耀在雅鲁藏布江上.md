    Mao Zedong's Radiance Shines on the Yarlung Zangbo River
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Tian
    Chairman Mao's troops – the People's Liberation Army – have arrived in Xigaze City on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River in the western border of our country. The people of Xigaze City and Later Tibet are celebrating the beginning of their new lives, and they have quickly established a close, brotherly friendship with the PLA soldiers.
    Soon after the PLA was stationed in Xigaze City, the soldiers promoted the spirit of national unity and friendship, repairing dilapidated homes for the Tibetan people, cleaning streets and courtyards, and helping Tibetan people carry water. The Tibetan compatriots warmly felt that with one more soldier, the family had one more son. When the early spring thawed, the troops began land reclamation and production, and the Tibetan people automatically lent tools and assisted the PLA in repairing canals and diverting water. After the farmers visited the soldiers using drills (sowing carts) to sow seeds and waterwheels to draw water to irrigate the seedlings, they admired and praised, "The people educated by Chairman Mao are truly good and capable!"
    PLA staff members visited Lazi and Xiegar Zong west of Xigaze. Every time they arrived in a village or town, they were surrounded by Tibetan people. After the staff members publicized the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the Tibetan people were very grateful to Chairman Mao, comparing Chairman Mao to the sun. They regarded seeing Chairman Mao's portrait as their happiness. People circulated the Tibetan version of the People's Pictorial and various Tibetan books and periodicals, reluctant to easily let their eyes pass over them. The head of the Red Sect in the Sakya area warmly received the PLA staff members. He took out the decree of imperial appointment from the Ming Dynasty, preserved for nearly four hundred years, to illustrate their long-standing historical relationship with the motherland.
    After the PLA arrived in Xigaze, every Tibetan compatriot felt that Xigaze had changed. They could freely travel back and forth day and night to do business. Qu Pei, the headman of Tuoba Xiama (north of Xigaze), said after hearing the report from the PLA staff: For decades, we have lived in the dark. In the past, imperialists used one pack of tea to steal twenty-six packs of wool from me. With Chairman Mao's leadership, we will no longer be subjected to this kind of cruel exploitation in the future! Two poor farmers in Zhu Village in the southern suburbs of Xigaze received more than 200 kilograms of seeds lent by the PLA without interest. This year, there was a lot of rain, and the highland barley seedlings grew particularly strong. Old man Puzhao, who is seventy years old, said: The sun is shining on us! The children of Xigaze, the girls carrying water by the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the boatmen paddling yak-hide boats on the river are all happily singing "The East is Red."

    毛泽东的光芒照耀在雅鲁藏布江上
    新华社记者    林田
    毛主席的队伍——人民解放军来到了我国西部边疆雅鲁藏布江边的日喀则城。日喀则城和后藏的人民欢庆自己新的生活的开始，他们和解放军战士很快地建立了亲密的兄弟般的友谊。
    当解放军进驻到日喀则城不久，战士们就发扬了民族团结友爱的精神，为藏族人民修补残破的家园，打扫街道院落，帮助藏民背水。藏族同胞都亲切地感到多来一个战士，家里就多了一个子弟。初春解冻的时候，部队开始开荒生产，藏民们自动借给工具，还协助解放军进行修渠引水的工作。农民们在参观了战士用耧（播种的车子）播种，用水车抽水灌苗以后，钦佩赞扬地说：“毛主席教养出的人真是又好又能干！”
    解放军的工作人员到日喀则以西的拉孜、协噶尔各宗去访问，每到一个村镇就被藏民围聚起来。工作人员向他们宣传了中央人民政府毛主席的民族政策和“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”以后，藏民们都非常感激毛主席，把毛主席比作太阳。他们把看到毛主席像当作是自己的幸福。人们传阅着藏文版的人民画报和各种藏文书刊，舍不得轻易地放过眼去。萨迦地方红教首领热情地招待解放军的工作人员，他拿出保存了近四百年的明代帝王册封的命令，来说明他们和祖国不可分的悠久历史关系。
    解放军到达日喀则后，每个藏族同胞都感到日喀则变样了，白天晚上都可以自由来往作生意。托巴下玛（日喀则北面）头人屈培听了解放军工作人员报告后说：几十年来我们像在黑夜里过日子，帝国主义者过去用一驮茶盗换去我二十六驮羊毛，我们有了毛主席领导，今后不再受这种残酷的剥削了！日喀则南郊朱村的两个贫苦农民得到解放军无利贷给的二百多斤种籽，今年雨水多青稞苗长得特别壮实，七十岁的老人普照说：太阳照到我们这里了！日喀则的儿童们，雅鲁藏布江畔背水的姑娘们和江面上撑牛皮船的水手们都快活地唱着“东方红”。
