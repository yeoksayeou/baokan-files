Democratic Progressive Association, Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and other democratic parties
Protest the US bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant
[This newspaper's dispatch] The China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and other democratic parties have issued written statements denouncing the US aggressors' bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant and other peaceful facilities, and sternly warning the US aggressors that they must be held responsible for the serious consequences that may arise from this heinous act.
    A spokesman for the China Association for Promoting Democracy stated: The US aggressors' insane bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant and other non-military facilities has aroused the utmost anger and protest from the people of China and North Korea and the people of the world. The US imperialists regard peaceful constructions like the Yalu River Power Plant, which are necessary to maintain the peaceful lives of the broad masses of people, as "military targets" for their insane destruction. What else can be said except that it further proves that US imperialism's military aggression has reached an extremely brutal, despicable, and shameful level? The US imperialists' inhuman crime of indiscriminately bombing peaceful constructions, like their crime of using extermination-level germ warfare, must not only be held responsible for all serious consequences, but must also be severely sanctioned by the people of China and North Korea and the people of the world. The US imperialists' delusion of obtaining at the negotiating table what they cannot obtain from their already bankrupt military offensive is bound to meet the same bankrupt end as their delusion of obtaining from the negotiating table what they cannot obtain from their military offensive.
    A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party stated: The provocative bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant by the US aggressors is another exposure of the US aggressors' deliberate sabotage of the armistice negotiations and their attempt to expand the war. We lodge a serious protest against this barbaric provocation by the US aggressors. At the same time, we warn the US aggressors that all criminal acts that violate the peaceful will of the people of the world will inevitably meet with shameful failure. For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, and for the sake of human justice, our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party will call on all party members to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with all their strength until the complete defeat of all the conspiracies of US imperialism.
    A spokesman for the China Zhi Gong Party stated: The US aggressors are clearly attempting to use this unprecedentedly barbaric crime—the so-called "military pressure"—to intimidate the people of China and North Korea in order to obtain at the Korean armistice negotiation table what they cannot obtain on the battlefield. But in fact, any "military pressure" that the US aggressors believe in has long been bankrupt. From MacArthur's so-called "Christmas Offensive" to Ridgway's so-called "Autumn Offensive," all have been crushed under the giant palms of the people of China and North Korea. The US imperialists should know that no "military pressure" and no robber-like violence can scare the iron-like, already liberated people of China and North Korea. On the contrary, this provocative crime against the people of Asia and the world who love peace is enough to arouse the unparalleled anger and irreconcilable hatred of the people of China and North Korea towards the aggressors. We protest against this expansion of war and inhumane atrocities committed by the American bandits. The US aggressors must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences arising from this criminal act.
    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Council of the Jiusan Society, stated: We want to warn the US aggressors, who are incorrigible to the end, that no barbaric acts of provocation can reverse the inevitable failure of your war in Korea. The people of China and North Korea have been ignited with irreconcilable hatred for your repeated inhuman crimes, and they will definitely fight more resolutely and bravely to completely defeat your criminal plan to expand the war of aggression. We cannot but express our great indignation at the British Conservative government, which slavishly follows the US aggressors' military adventurous policies. The facts have exposed that the British Conservative government is an accomplice in this new provocation by the United States, and at the same time, it shows that in all the US aggressors' criminal activities to expand aggression and undermine peace, Britain is a shameful follower and accomplice. The British government cannot evade its responsibility for this series of crimes. I call on all members of the Jiusan Society to respond to the mad provocations of the US aggressors with practical actions. We must strengthen the struggle against aggression and for the defense of peace in our different work positions, strengthen the education of patriotism and internationalism, and further unite with people in the cultural, educational, and scientific circles across the country to strive for the victory of the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea to the end!
    A spokesman for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League stated: The bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant is a further great provocation by the US aggressors against our country, Asia, and the peace-loving people of the world; it is another heinous crime committed by the US aggressors in Korea. We absolutely cannot tolerate this inhumane crime that completely opposes human peace and creates even greater disasters! We must turn anger into strength and more actively strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea until all the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism are completely smashed. We want to warn the US aggressors, who appear strong but are weak inside, that the firm will of the people of China and North Korea to fight for the truth of peace cannot be changed in the slightest. The people of China and North Korea will never be intimidated by any pressure. Barbaric and despicable means will only arouse the unparalleled indignation of the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people of the world, and will impose more severe sanctions on the aggressors!

    民主促进会、农工民主党等民主党派
    抗议美国滥炸鸭绿江发电厂暴行
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟等民主党派，纷纷发表书面谈话，怒斥美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂等和平设备的暴行，并严正警告美国侵略者必须对它们的这一罪恶行为可能产生的严重后果负责。
    中国民主促进会发言人称：美国侵略者疯狂轰炸鸭绿江发电厂等非军事设备的暴行，已经激起了朝中人民和全世界人民万分的愤怒和抗议。美帝国主义把像鸭绿江发电厂这类维持广大人民和平生活所必需的和平建设，都作为它疯狂破坏的“军事目标”，除了更加证明美帝国主义的军事侵略到了极端残暴、卑劣、可耻的地步，还有什么可说呢？美帝国主义大事滥炸和平建设的违反人道的罪行，和它使用灭绝人性的细菌战罪行一样，不但要对一切严重后果负责，而且一定要受到朝中人民和世界人民严厉的制裁。美帝国主义妄想从早经破产的军事进攻中得到在谈判桌上所不能得到的东西，必然和它妄想从谈判桌上得到在军事进攻中所不能得到的东西一样，遭到破产的结局。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会发言人称：美国侵略者对鸭绿江发电厂进行的挑衅轰炸，是美国侵略者蓄意破坏停战谈判，企图扩大战争阴谋又一次的暴露。对于美国侵略者的这种野蛮挑衅，我们提出严重抗议。同时，并警告美国侵略者，一切违反世界人民和平意志的罪恶行为，必将遭到可耻的失败。为了亚洲和世界和平，为了人类的正义，我们中国农工民主党将号召全体党员以一切力量，支援中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军，直到美帝国主义一切阴谋的彻底失败时为止。
    中国致公党发言人称：美国侵略者显然是企图用这种旷古未闻的野蛮罪行——所谓“军事压力”，来恫吓朝中人民，以便在朝鲜停战谈判席上获得他们在战场上所不可能得到的东西。但事实上，美国侵略者所迷信的任何“军事压力”，都是早已破产了的。由麦克阿瑟的所谓“圣诞节攻势”，至李奇微的所谓“秋季攻势”，都已在朝中人民的巨掌下被粉碎了。美国帝国主义者，应当知道，任何“军事压力”，任何强盗暴行，都是吓不倒钢铁一般的已经解放了的朝中人民的。相反地，这种对亚洲及世界和平人民的挑衅罪行，却更足以激起朝中人民对侵略者的无比愤怒和不共戴天的仇恨。我们抗议美国强盗们这种扩大战争、灭绝人性的暴行。对于这一罪恶行为所将引起的一切严重后果，美国侵略者必须负全部责任。
    九三学社中央理事会主席许德珩称：我们要警告至死不悟的美国侵略者，任何野蛮的挑衅行为都不可能挽回你们在朝鲜战争中注定了的失败的结局。朝中人民对于你们屡次灭绝人性的滔天罪行，已经燃烧起不共戴天的愤恨，一定更要坚决、更勇敢地战斗下去，彻底打败你们扩大侵略战争的罪恶计划。我们对于奴颜婢膝地追随美国侵略者军事冒险政策的英国保守党政府，也不能不表示极大的愤慨。事实已经暴露了英国保守党政府是参加美国这次新挑衅的同谋犯，同时也表明了在美国侵略者的一切扩大侵略，破坏和平的罪恶活动中，英国都是可耻的追随者和帮凶。英国政府对于这一连串的罪行，都不能逃避它应负的责任。我号召九三学社的全体社员以实际行动来回答美国侵略者的疯狂的挑衅。我们要在不同的工作岗位上加强反对侵略，保卫和平的斗争，加强爱国主义和国际主义的教育，并进一步和全国文教科学界人士团结一致，为争取抗美援朝战争的胜利而奋斗到底！
    台湾民主自治同盟发言人称：滥炸鸭绿江发电厂，是美国侵略者进一步地对我国、亚洲及全世界爱好和平人民的一个极大的挑衅；是美国侵略者在朝鲜又一次犯下的滔天罪行。这种彻底敌视人类和平，制造更大灾难的违反人道的罪恶行为，是我们绝不能容忍的！我们一定要把愤怒变成力量，更积极地加强抗美援朝工作，直到彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计为止。我们要警告外强中干的美国侵略者，朝中人民为和平的真理而斗争的坚决意志，是丝毫也不能改变的。朝中人民绝不是什么压力所能吓倒的。野蛮卑鄙的手段只有更激起朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民的无比愤恨，并将予侵略者更严厉的制裁！
