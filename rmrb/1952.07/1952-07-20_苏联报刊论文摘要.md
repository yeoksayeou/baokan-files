Abstract of Soviet Newspaper Articles
On Several Shortcomings in Leading Emulation Work
The "Labor Daily" of the Soviet Union published an article by Slutsky on June 8 entitled "Matters to be Noted in Leading Socialist Emulation." The abstract is as follows:

The socialist emulation among workers of various industries, which arose during the Great Patriotic War, has gained increasing scale. This effective form of individual competition enables the promotion of the best labor methods, enhances the assistance of advanced workers to backward workers, and develops the creative initiative of the working people.

In accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, trade unions have done a lot of work, and the socialist emulation of workers in major enterprise departments has entered a new and higher stage. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the leadership of the competition.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions instructed that the title of "Excellent Worker" should not be evaluated based on the results of one month as in the past, but should be evaluated based on the completion of all competition conditions for three consecutive months. However, the economic leaders and trade union leaders of many enterprises did not fully understand this instruction, and in practice, they awarded the title of "Excellent Worker" to advanced workers every three months. This is completely incorrect.

Various competitions should be summarized monthly in a timely manner. The factory committee can only award the title of "Excellent" to those workers who have completed all the competition conditions of the previous three months.

Each enterprise must formulate conditions that stipulate: the positions participating in the competition, the indicators that workers should complete to obtain the "Excellent" title, the summary procedure, various forms of encouraging winners, etc. The competition conditions should be jointly formulated by the production-mass work committee and administrative representatives, discussed at the workers' general meeting, and then submitted to the factory committee meeting for approval. The most important thing is to notify each competition participant of these conditions.

When organizing competitions in each enterprise, the characteristics of the work of all staff members of the enterprise should be taken into account. It is absolutely impossible to formulate the same standard "typical" conditions for all enterprises.

Leading the competition should enable every new initiative of advanced workers to gain mass popularity and organically enrich the content of obligations. That is to say, every initiative of the Stakhanovite workers should simultaneously have serious explanatory work on the part of the trade union, should be consolidated by the necessary and practical plans on the part of the economic leaders, and should raise the competition to a new stage.

The titles of "Stakhanovite Worker" and "Shock Worker" are one of the forms of social encouragement. The workshop committee usually confers this title to workers in consultation with the workshop director, based on the suggestions of the foreman and trade union group leader. However, recently many workshop committees have delegated this matter to the administrative organization.

Following Comrade Stalin's instructions, Orjonikidze once answered the question of who should be considered a Stakhanovite worker:

"If a worker overfulfills the standard by 20-30 percent, can he be called a Stakhanovite worker? It is wrong to ask the question like this. Each department and each enterprise should be specifically mentioned; each enterprise and each lathe should be treated very carefully. Otherwise, we cannot formulate a correct definition, otherwise, this definition will be formulaic... You will not find a universal definition and a universal percentage. For some enterprises that have more new technologies, it will be one percentage, and for other enterprises that are lagging behind in mastering new technologies, it will be another percentage."

Orjonikidze also said:

"We care about Stakhanovite workers, but forget about shock workers. We forget that Stakhanovite workers are recruited and supplemented from the ranks of shock workers, and forget that the Stakhanovite movement itself is the highest form of shock work. Shock workers are the huge army that completes and overfulfills our production plans. Shock workers are a reserve force, from which the ranks of Stakhanovite workers are constantly and systematically supplemented and expanded."

Rewarding the winners plays an important role in further developing socialist emulation.

Developing Democracy within the Party
The "People's Daily" published an editorial on June 30 entitled "Developing Democracy within the Party." The abstract is as follows:

Democracy within our party is growing and developing. Thoroughly implementing democracy within the party can consolidate our party organizations, promote the initiative of party members, create the most important conditions for the whole party and individual communists to realize their vanguard role among the masses, thereby promoting new achievements in all fields of economic and cultural construction.

Democracy within the party refers to the committee system in work. The committee system is manifested in jointly formulating resolutions and in jointly organizing the masses to complete the work of the resolutions passed. In the organizational life of the party, regularly convening plenary sessions of the party committee and convening party activist conferences to discuss the most important issues of party organization activities are of great significance.

Expanding criticism and self-criticism is one of the most important principles of democracy within the party. Comrade Stalin taught that in order for millions of workers and peasants to participate in the cause of criticism from below, "it is necessary to expand proletarian democracy in all mass organizations of the working class, and first of all within the party itself. Without this condition, self-criticism is equal to zero, equal to an empty shelf, an empty word."

Only on the basis of democracy within the party can Bolshevik self-criticism be expanded, and can the party discipline, which should not be mechanical but conscious, be consolidated.

In expanding democracy within the party, criticism and self-criticism, the role of the Bolshevik press, as the sharp and most powerful weapon of our party, is inestimable. Party organs should make more extensive use of the press to summarize and disseminate advanced experiences in party work, and point out the best examples of thoroughly implementing democracy within the party and improving the initiative of party members.

Democracy within the party can ensure the continuous improvement of the creative initiative of party members, and expand the sense of responsibility of each communist for the entrusted cause and for the work of party organizations. The thorough realization of the principles of democracy within the party can consolidate our party organizations and enhance the role of party organizations in striving for the successful resolution of the tasks of communist construction.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    论领导竞赛工作中的几个缺点
    苏联劳动报六月八日发表了斯鲁茨基所著“论对社会主义竞赛的领导中应注意的事项”。摘要如下：
    在伟大的卫国战争期间所产生的各种同业工人之间的社会主义竞赛，获得了愈来愈大的规模。这一种个人竞赛的有效形式，使最好的劳动方法得以推广，先进者对落后者的帮助得以增进，并使劳动人民创造的积极性得以发展。
    职工会依照全苏工会中央理事会第六次全会的决议，做了很多工作，在主要企业部门，工人的社会主义竞赛，已经进入了新的、更高的阶段。但是，在竞赛的领导方面，仍有着严重的缺点。
    全苏工会中央理事会第六次全会发出指示：不要像过去那样按一个月的结果来评定授予“优秀工人”的称号，而应按照连续三个月中完成全部竞赛的条件情况予以评定。但是许多企业的经济领导者和职工会领导者对于这个指示体会不够，在实行上变得每隔三个月对先进者授予一次“优秀工人”的称号。这完全是不正确的。
    各种竞赛应当抓紧时间每个月做一次总结。工厂委员会只能把这个“优秀”的称号授予完成了前三个月全部竞赛条件的那些工人。
    每个企业必须制订出一些条件，其中规定：参加竞赛的职别，工人为获得“优秀”称号所应完成的指标，做总结的程序，鼓舞胜利者的各种形式等等。竞赛条件应由生产—群众工作委员会与行政代表共同制订，并在工人全体大会上予以讨论，然后再交由工厂委员会会议批准。最重要的就是要把这些条件通知每个竞赛参加者。
    在每个企业中组织竞赛时，应当考虑到该企业全体工作人员工作的特性。决不能对所有的企业制订出同样标准的“典型”的条件。
    领导竞赛应当使先进者的每个新创举都能获得群众性的普及，并能有机地使义务的内容丰富起来。就是说，斯塔哈诺夫工作者的每个创举，应当同时有工会方面的认真的说明工作，应当以经济领导者方面的必要而实际的方案来加以巩固，并应当把竞赛提高到新的阶段。
    “斯塔哈诺夫工作者”和“突击工作者”的称号，是社会鼓励形式之一。车间委员会照例是会同车间主任，根据领班和工会小组长的建议，把这个称号授予工人的。但是最近许多车间委员会却把这件事情转托给行政组织了。
    遵照着斯大林同志的指示，奥尔忠尼启则曾这样回答了谁应当被认为是斯塔哈诺夫工作者的问题：
    “如果一个工人超额完成了标准的百分之二十—三十，可以把他称为斯塔哈诺夫工作者吗？这样提问题是不对的。应当具体地举出每个部门，每个企业；应当极细微地分别对待每个企业，每个车床。否则，我们就不能制订一个正确的定义，否则，这个定义将是公式化的…你不会找到一个通用的定义和通用的百分比。对于握有更多的新技术威力的一些企业，将是一种百分比，对于掌握新技术较落后的另外一些企业，则又是另外一种百分比。”
    奥尔忠尼启则又说：
    “我们关心到斯塔哈诺夫工作者，而把突击工作者忘记了。我们忘记了斯塔哈诺夫工作者是从突击工作者的队伍中来吸取补充的，忘记了斯塔哈诺夫运动的本身，就是最高的突击形式。突击工作者就是完成和超额完成我们生产计划的巨大的军队。突击工作者，就是一支后备队，从这里，经常地有系统地补充和扩大斯塔哈诺夫工作者的行列。”
    对胜利者的奖励，在进一步发展社会主义竞赛中，起着重要的作用。
    发展党内的民主
    六月三十日真理报发表以“发展党内的民主”为题的社论，摘要如下：
    我们党内的民主正在增长着和发展着。彻底实行党内民主，可以巩固我们的党组织，促进党员群众的积极性，为全党和个别共产党员在群众中实现先锋作用创造最重要的条件，从而促进经济和文化建设一切领域内的新成就。
    党内民主就是指工作中的委员制而言。委员制表现在共同制订决议方面，又表现在共同组织群众完成所通过的决议的工作方面。在党组织生活中，经常地召开党委会全体会议，为讨论党组织活动的最重要问题而召开的党内积极分子大会，是有着重大的意义的。
    展开批评和自我批评就是党内民主最重要原则之一。斯大林同志教导说，为了使数百万的工农群众参加从下而来的批评事业，“就必须在工人阶级的一切群众组织里，而首先在党本身内部，展开无产阶级的民主。没有这个条件，自我批评便等于零、等于一个空架子、一句空话而已。”
    只有在党内民主的基础上，才能展开布尔什维克的自我批评，才能把应当不是机械的而是自觉的党的纪律巩固起来。
    在展开党内民主、批评和自我批评中，作为我党尖锐的，最强有力的武器的布尔什维克报刊的作用是无法估计的。党的机关应当更广泛地利用报刊总结和传播党工作的先进经验，指出彻底实行党内民主，提高党员群众的积极性的最好的范例。
    党内的民主可以保证党员群众创造性倡议的不断提高，展开每个共产党员对被付托的事业的责任感和对党组织工作的责任感。党内民主原则的彻底实现可以巩固我们的党组织，提高党组织在争取成功地解决共产主义建设任务的作用。
