How the Trade Union of Tianjin Private Hongda Stationery Factory United with Capitalists to Resume Work and Production
Kang Yonghe

    After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the trade union of the Tianjin Private Hongda Stationery Factory led all employees to actively unite with the capitalists to improve production, enabling the factory, which had been shut down for a month and a half, to resume work and production. They also launched a patriotic production increase and savings competition, becoming the first factory among the more than one thousand households in the Tianjin Shop Employees' Union Federation to carry out a production competition.

    Both Unity and Struggle

    The Hongda Stationery Factory was called Hongda Stationery Store before liberation, specializing in speculative business. After liberation, in June 1950, it was transformed into a factory manufacturing stationery items such as lecture clipboards and meter rulers. Due to the hard work of the employees, the capitalists gained huge profits, with capital expanding from over 50 million yuan to over 350 million yuan. However, the factory did not give the employees a single penny in bonuses and refused the workers' demands to adjust wages and change temporary workers to permanent workers. Under the leadership of the industry trade union, the factory trade union, in the spirit of first improving production and then resolving welfare issues, launched two consecutive production competition campaigns in July and August 1951, and then conducted a struggle with the capitalists to adjust wages and change temporary workers to permanent workers. After the struggle, the capitalists changed twenty old temporary workers to permanent workers but dismissed the remaining nine temporary workers by means of retaining their positions without pay. In November of the same year, the trade union took advantage of the large orders at the North China Rural and Urban Materials Exchange Exhibition and the capitalists' need for workers to process continuously, to mobilize on-the-job workers to assist seven dismissed temporary workers in resuming their jobs. After the start of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the capitalists, citing reasons such as state-owned companies being busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign, not purchasing, not processing orders, and finished products not being able to be sold, announced a shutdown on January 4 this year, and wanted to dismiss a large number of workers, attempting to continue their attack on the workers and evade the "Five-Anti" campaign. Because the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau decided that workers were not allowed to be dismissed during the "Five-Anti" campaign, the capitalists' plan could not be realized, so they adopted a passive and uncooperative approach to resist. In this situation, for the benefit of everyone, the trade union tried every means to urge the capitalists to resume work, but the capitalists said, "I can't do anything, you do it!" With the consent of the capitalists, the trade union united all employees to work hard, overcome difficulties, and save the dangerous situation. On February 23, the machines started running again. Immediately afterwards, in early March, the struggle against the "Five Evils" was launched, so that the manager, who had attempted to evade the "Five-Anti" campaign, made eight promises to the workers on April 7, when he "passed the test," including obeying the leadership of the working class and not breaking the law again. On the seventh day after "passing the test," the trade union took the initiative to find the capitalists to hold a labor-capital symposium, once again explaining the policies to the capitalists, and encouraging the capitalists' confidence in management with the concrete facts that the workers had helped the capitalists resume work and production and overcome difficulties. After that, the trade union took the initiative to find the capitalists and held three consecutive labor-capital consultation meetings. The first meeting was specifically to resolve the issue of improving the production system; at the second meeting, the capitalists took the initiative to propose changing seven temporary workers to permanent workers; the third meeting signed a contract to launch a patriotic production increase and savings competition. It is now in the midst of a heated competition.

    The Trade Union was Consolidated in the Struggle

    Hongda Stationery Factory is a small private factory with twenty-nine female workers and seven male workers and employees each. There are only three electric planers, and most of the work is done manually. The treatment of workers is very unreasonable. Originally, the working hours were eleven hours, and overtime was frequent; the wages were very low, the highest being 300 catties of millet, and the lowest being 50 catties; there were only two half-day holidays a month. The trade union of this factory, in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level trade union, conducted several consultations and struggles with the capitalists on the basis of developing production over the past two years, changing the working hours to nine hours, making appropriate adjustments to wages, increasing the highest to 330 catties and the lowest to 120 catties. The big Sunday rest system was implemented. In addition, the trade union organized many workers to participate in spare-time schools, so that everyone's cultural level and political awareness were improved, and they understood the principle of "who feeds whom." Especially when the factory collapsed, the trade union led everyone to overcome many difficulties, reviving the factory and ensuring the occupations and lives of all employees. The trade union has done so many things for everyone, so the employees warmly support the trade union and care about the work of the trade union. Everyone actively participates in all the calls of the trade union.

    However, before the "Five-Anti" campaign, due to the unreasonableness of the wage system, coupled with the instigation of the foremen Zhao Changhao and Zhao Yingtao, the unity of the employees of this factory was not very good. For example, they said to the male workers: "The female workers' jobs are light, but they get more, it's really unfair, why don't you exchange jobs with them?" In front of the female workers, they pretended to be good people and said, "The male workers carry leather, how can the female workers do those heavy jobs?" Some employees looked down on the workers. The workers also looked down on the employees. But through the successive struggles against dismissal and the "Five-Anti" campaign, both male and female employees felt the benefits of uniting. When there was not enough money to pay wages during the New Year, the male workers took the initiative to ask for less so that the female workers could receive more to solve family difficulties. Employees and workers also became one. Everyone is closely united around the trade union, expelling the Zhao brothers, who provoked discord, alienated unity, and hindered the resumption of work, from membership. And on the basis of the trade union's "Three-Anti" democratic make-up lesson and the victory of the "Five-Anti" campaign, the grass-roots trade union was reorganized.

    Comrade Guo Risheng, the original chairman of the trade union, has an excellent style of serving the public by being selfless and putting others first. In order to change temporary workers and oppose the capitalists' dismissal of workers, he conducted a resolute struggle with the capitalists with the support of the masses. In the cold winter, he ran to the Labor Bureau two or three times a day, and even when he was ill in bed, he was still concerned about the resumption of work, and often struggled to get up to work, and voluntarily took out the money for treating his lung disease to cook meals for everyone to get through the difficulties. Guo Risheng was re-elected as the chairman of the trade union this time.

    For example, Comrade Liu Zhengang, he can serve the masses wholeheartedly, without regard for personal gains and losses, and can unite the workers who oppose him. When he was acting as chairman of Guo Risheng's work, the situation of the factory was very serious, the capitalists were passively working, and they insisted on dismissing workers, and there were many difficulties in production. But Liu Zhengang did not retreat. Based on the will of the vast majority of employees to resume work, he led everyone to overcome the difficulties; persuaded individual workers' negative ideas of "if it collapses, register with the Labor Bureau"; criticized the backward thinking of "not starting work, giving wages is better than anything"; and resolutely opposed the Zhao brothers' selfish behavior of wanting to collapse the factory to divide more bonuses, so as to expand their private factory. As a result, the factory went from shutdown to resumption of work, and from resumption of work to expansion of production. Due to his exemplary deeds, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the trade union when the grass-roots trade union was reorganized.

    After this reorganization and rectification, the trade union organization of Hongda Stationery Factory was further consolidated.

    Improved Capitalists' Confidence in Management

    The most prominent and most basic advantage of the work of the trade union of Hongda Stationery Factory is that the idea of developing production is very clear. They understand that workers should also be responsible for production in private enterprises. Only by improving production can the welfare of employees be resolved, wealth can be added to the country; and the capitalists can be united to promote their enthusiasm for managing production. Therefore, they did not relax production during the "Five-Anti" campaign. Everyone worked together, under the leadership of Yu Zepu, the production committee member of the trade union, and gave full play to their high degree of creativity and initiative, using waste products such as grass board strips, lining paper and face paper strips, steel wire, and lead wire to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Improved the method of cutting paper and iron, saving more than ten pieces of grass board paper worth more than 8 million yuan. The manual paper cutter was also changed to an electric paper cutter, saving manpower and increasing output. In order to open up sales channels, the trade union suggested that the capitalists send Yu Zepu to other places to sell finished products and collect outstanding debts, so that more than 3,000 dozens of lecture clipboards (worth about 100 million yuan) found a way out. Department stores also came with new orders. Due to the above efforts, the cost of products was reduced by 12.5%. Output increased by 30% compared to 1951. The quality has also been significantly improved. On June 1, the factory held a patriotic production increase and savings competition mobilization meeting, and the labor and capital parties signed a production competition contract. The contract is very simple and easy to implement. Manager Zhang Yanting said to the employees and the guests attending the meeting—workers and managers from other factories—at the meeting: "In December last year, I lost confidence in managing production, and I always wanted to reduce business, but with the help of the trade union and all employees, my confidence in managing production has been gradually improved. From the process of this resumption of work and production, I have personally seen the greatness of the working class. In the future, I must operate and produce stationery that is beneficial to the people's cultural undertakings under the leadership of the working class and relying on everyone."

    天津市私营宏达文具厂工会是怎样团结资方复业开工的
    康永和
    天津市私营宏达文具厂工会，在“五反”后领导全体职工积极团结资方搞好生产，使停工一个半月的工厂复业开工，并且展开了爱国增产节约竞赛运动，成为天津市店员工会联合业工会一千多户中的第一个开展生产竞赛的工厂。
    又团结又斗争
    宏达文具厂在解放前叫宏达文具商行，专做投机捣把生意。解放后，在一九五○年六月改为制造讲义夹子、米达尺等文具用品的工厂。由于职工的努力生产，资方获得了巨大的利润，资本额从五千多万元扩大到三亿五千多万元，但是，厂方一文钱的奖励也不给职工，又拒绝工人们调整工资和改临时工为长工的要求。该厂工会在行业工会领导下，本着先搞好生产再解决福利问题的精神，在一九五一年七、八月间，连续领导工人开展两次生产竞赛运动之后，向资方进行了调整工资和改临时工为长工的斗争。经过斗争以后，资方把二十个老临时工改为长工，但把其余的九个临时工用留职停薪的手段解雇了。工会又在同年十一月趁着华北区城乡物资交流展览会订货很多、资方要工人连续加工的时机，发动在职工人援助七名被解雇的临时工复了业。“三反”和“五反”运动开始后，资方又藉口国营公司忙于“三反”运动，不收购、不加工订货、成品不能推销出去等理由，在今年一月四日宣布停工，并要解雇大批的工人，企图继续向工人进攻，并躲避“五反”运动。由于天津市人民政府劳动局决定“五反”运动中不准解雇工人，资方的计划不得实现，乃以消极不干的办法来对抗。在这种情况下，工会为了大家的利益，想尽办法督促资方复工，但资方说：“我没办法，你们干吧！”在取得资方同意下，工会团结全体职工艰苦奋斗，战胜困难，把危难的局面挽救过来。二月二十三日，机器转动起来了。紧接着在三月上旬就展开了反“五毒”的斗争，使企图躲避“五反”的经理在四月七日“过关”的时候，规规矩矩地向工人立下了服从工人阶级领导和不再违法等八条保证。“过关”后的第七天，工会主动找资方开劳资座谈会，再一次地向资方说明政策，并以工人们帮助资方复业开工度过难关的具体事实来鼓励资方的经营信心。其后，工会又主动地找资方连续开了三次劳资协商会议。第一次会议专门协议解决改进生产制度的问题；在第二次会议中，资方主动提出改七名临时工为长工；第三次会议签订了开展爱国增产节约竞赛的合同。现在正在展开热烈竞赛中。
    斗争中巩固了工会
    宏达文具厂是一个私营的小工厂，有女工二十九名，男工和职员各七名。电动床子只有三部，大部分是手工作业。工人的待遇很不合理。原来工作时间是十一小时，还经常加班；工资很低，最高的是三百斤，最低的是五十斤；一个月只有两个半天的例假。这个厂的工会，两年来遵照上级工会的指示，在发展生产的基础上，向资方进行了多次的协商与斗争，把工时改为九个钟点，工资做了适当的调整，最高的增到三百三十斤，最低的增到了一百二十斤。实行了大礼拜制。另外工会组织许多工人参加业余学校，使大家的文化水平和政治觉悟程度都有所提高，弄清了“谁养活谁”的道理。尤其在工厂垮倒的情况下，工会领导大家战胜了许多困难，使工厂复活了，保障了全体职工的职业和生活。工会给大家办了这么多的事情，所以职工们都热烈地拥护工会，关心工会工作。凡是工会的号召，大家都积极地参加。
    但是，“五反”以前，由于工资制度的不合理，加上把头赵长镐、赵英涛的挑拨离间，该厂职工的团结是不太好的。例如他们在男工面前说：“女工活儿轻，却拿的多，真不公平，你们怎么不和她们换活儿做？”在女工面前又假装好人地说：“男工挑皮，那些重活，女工怎能做得了？”某些职员看不起工人。工人也瞧不起职员。但经过历次反对解雇的斗争以及“五反”运动，男女职工都感到了团结起来的好处。年节工资不够发，男工主动少要，让女工多领以解决家庭困难。职员和工人也打成了一片。大家都紧密地团结在工会的周围，把挑拨是非，离间团结阻碍复工的把头——赵家兄弟开除了会籍。并在工会“三反”民主补课和“五反”胜利的基础上，改组了基层工会。
    原工会主席郭日生同志，具有克己从众为大家服务的优良作风。为改临时工和反对资方解雇工人，在群众的支持下，他向资方进行了坚决的斗争。在数九寒天，一天跑两三次劳动局，直到病倒在床上还在关心复工的问题，并常常挣扎起来进行工作，自动把养肺病的钱拿出来给大家开伙吃饭，度过困难。郭日生这次被连选为工会主席。
    又如刘振刚同志，他能全心全意地为群众服务，不计较个人的得失，并能把反对他的工人团结过来。当他代理主席郭日生的工作时，工厂的情况非常严重，资本家消极怠工，硬要解雇工人，生产上遭到许多困难。但刘振刚没有后退，他依据绝大多数职工要求复工的意志，领导大家战胜了困难；说服了个别工人的“垮了到劳动局登记”的消极想法；批评了“不开工，给工资比什么也好”的落后思想；坚决反对了赵家兄弟自私自利想搞垮厂子多分花红，好扩大其私厂的行为。使工厂由停工走到复工，由复工达到扩大生产。由于他的这些模范事迹，在改组基层工会时，他被选为工会副主席。
    经过这次改组与整顿，进一步巩固了宏达文具厂的工会组织。
    提高了资方经营信心
    宏达文具厂工会工作最突出的，也是最基本的优点，就是发展生产的思想很明确。他们懂得私营企业中的生产，工人们也应负责任。只有搞好了生产，才能解决职工的福利问题，才能给国家增加财富；也才能团结资本家发扬其经营生产的积极性。所以他们在“五反”斗争中也没有放松过生产，大家团结一致，在工会生产委员于泽圃同志的领导下发挥了高度的创造性与积极性，利用草板纸条、里子纸和面子纸条、钢丝、铅丝等废品，解决了原料不足的困难。改进了裁纸、裁铁的方法，节省了价值八百多万元的十多件草板纸。还把人工裁纸刀改为电力裁纸刀，节省了人力，又提高了产量。为打开销路，工会建议资方派于泽圃到外埠推销成品，并兼收外欠，使三千多打讲义夹子（约值一亿多元）找到了出路。百货公司也来了新的订货。由于以上种种努力，产品的成本减低了百分之十二点五。产量比一九五一年提高了百分之三十。质量也有了显著提高。六月一日，这个厂举行了爱国增产节约竞赛动员大会，劳资双方签订了生产竞赛合同。合同订的非常简明易行。经理张言廷在大会上向职工及出席大会来宾——外厂工人和经理说：“去年十二月我失掉了经营生产的信心，老想缩小营业，但在工会和全体职工的帮助下，我经营生产的信心又一步一步地提高了。从这次复业开工的过程中，我亲身看到了工人阶级的伟大，今后一定要在工人阶级的领导下，依靠大家，努力经营有利于人民文化事业的文具生产。”
