Through various mass activities, conduct propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and launch a campaign to write letters to the soldiers at the front, reporting on the situation of the production increase and thrift campaign in the rear, and encouraging their fighting will.

	4. Inspect the work of giving preferential treatment. In rural areas, strive for a good harvest of land cultivated on behalf of servicemen; in cities, further improve the work of organizing production and introducing employment for families of martyrs and servicemen; go deep into villages and households to solve specific problems; and ensure that the lives of families of martyrs and servicemen are effectively guaranteed.
