    People of Yixian Yuting District Bravely Fight Floods to Protect State Property

    Editor: Southern Anhui mountainous area produces timber, and people from all over come to purchase timber every year. However, during the plum rain season every year, mountain floods often break out, and timber is easily washed away. On May 3 this year, a flood broke out in Yuting District, Yixian County, southern Anhui. The local river suddenly rose by sixteen chi (a Chinese unit of length), and the water was particularly fierce. The Anhui Provincial Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, Tunxi Office, had purchased two thousand liangma (a timber unit in South Central China, one liangma equals about 1.2 to 1.7 cubic meters) of timber here, placed on rafts in the river ready to be transported away. However, when the flood came, the large trees anchoring the rafts were uprooted, and the rafts were hit by large trees washed down from upstream and moved downstream. It looked like the timber was about to be washed away. Jiang Zhengzhong, the person in charge of the Yixian purchasing team of the company, immediately requested help from the Yuting District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yuting District People's Government. Under the leadership of the District Party Secretary and many cadres of the District People's Government, and with the active leadership of Xie Xiaokun, the village chief of Meicun village along the river, Xie Tongan, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and Jin Jiafa, the village chief of Shuanghan village, and Jiang Xiaoyuan, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, the young men and the broad masses of the people, regardless of the rain, rushed to the riverbank in groups to salvage timber, and finally salvaged this batch of state assets worth twelve billion yuan.

    The spirit of the people, who were risking their lives to save state assets, is truly admirable. This made me deeply realize that the noble character of the people in the era of Mao Zedong, who cherish state assets, is growing day by day.

    黟县渔亭区人民为保护国家财产和洪水英勇搏斗
    编辑同志：皖南山区产木材，每年各地都有人来采购木材。但每年梅雨季节，山洪常常暴发，木材很容易被冲失。今年五月三日，皖南黟县渔亭区洪水暴发了，当地河水陡然涨了一丈六尺，水势特别凶猛。中国煤业建筑器材公司安徽省公司屯溪办事处在这里曾收购了两千两码（中南区木材单位。一两码约等于一·二至一·七立方公尺）木材，放在河里木筏上准备运走。可是洪水来时，吊木筏的大树被连根拔起了，木筏也被上游冲来的大树撞击着往下走，眼看木材将被冲失。该公司黟县收购组负责同志江正忠立即向中共渔亭区委员会和渔亭区人民政府请求帮助。在该区区委书记和区人民政府许多干部的领导下，在沿河梅村村长谢小坤、农会主任谢同安和双汉村村长金家发、农会主任蒋小源等积极带头下，年青的小伙子们和广大群众不顾雨淋，成群结队地奔向河边抢捞木材，终于捞出了这批价值十二亿元的国家资财。
    人民群众这种为抢救国家资财而奋不顾身的精神，真令人感佩。从这里使我深深认识到，毛泽东时代的人民，爱护国家资财的高尚品德正日渐增长着。
