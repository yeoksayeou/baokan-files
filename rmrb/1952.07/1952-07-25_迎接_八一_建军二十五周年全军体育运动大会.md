Welcoming the "August 1st" Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Army All-Army Sports Meeting
Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission

The widespread development of sports activities in the People's Liberation Army can not only train our commanders and fighters to have strong physiques, and enable their physical functions to develop more healthily, but also cultivate their excellent qualities of courage, perseverance, agility, flexibility and collectivism. The Soviet Union lists knowledge education, moral education, technical education, physical education, and art and aesthetic education as the five major components of communist education; physical education is an important part of communist education; outstanding commanders and leaders of the Soviet army attach great importance to sports training in the troops.

Our army has attached importance to sports activities since its establishment. Commander-in-Chief Zhu never forgot to advocate and carry out possible sports programs in the troops during the extremely difficult Red Army era. In "On the Liberated Area Battlefield," he further clearly pointed out: "Troop training is divided into three aspects: intelligence, physical strength, and technology." He listed physical training as one of the three major contents of troop training. After the Central People's Government advocated the development of new national sports, our army attached equal importance to sports and military, political, and cultural education, and listed them as the four major training subjects for the troops.

At present, the Korean armistice negotiations have not yet reached an agreement. The aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is still trying to maintain international tension and is even more blatantly actively preparing for a new war. In order to consolidate our national defense, strengthen the forces for defending world peace, and be ready to repel all provocations and aggressions by the war-mongers at any time, our army is accelerating the regularization and modernization of its construction. Under this situation, this year's "August 1st," when we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of our army, holding such a grand sports meeting and vigorously promoting sports activities in the troops is of particularly great significance.

Our army's sports activities serve the construction of the troops and develop with the development of the troops. In the past, during the guerrilla war period, according to the needs of the troops and the conditions permitted by the environment, we could only practice mountain climbing in the mountains, swimming in the lakes, and horsemanship in the grasslands. During the Liberation War, although our troops grew stronger, it was still impossible to carry out organized and planned sports activities in the entire army due to the extreme frequency of the war. After the end of the Liberation War, sports activities gradually began to be carried out in an organized and planned manner in the training movement to build a regularized and modernized national defense army; especially after the All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Competition was held last year, major military regions successively convened literary and sports congresses, and sports activities began to gain vigorous development.

However, this does not mean that we can consider ourselves satisfied. At present, the development of sports activities in our troops is still far from meeting the actual needs of our troops' construction. The specific manifestations are: first, some comrades still have insufficient understanding of sports activities, and still believe that sports is only a simple form of entertainment or game; second, the development of sports activities in the troops is not comprehensive enough, and its mass character is not widespread enough; third, various arms of the services have not clearly noticed that according to the special needs of their own troops, they should consciously vigorously promote certain sports in their own troops, so as to more closely combine sports activities with the construction of the troops; fourth, sports activities have not yet become regularized; we have not yet established a regular sports system in our troops; many comrades still regard sports activities as short-term, temporary crash tasks, and think that they have completed the task by holding two sports meets, and have not yet realized that sports activities in the troops should be long-term and regular activities. This year, to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day, the Party and higher authorities have spent great efforts to convene such a grand sports meeting, just to vigorously overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, so that the troops' sports activities can catch up with the needs of the troops' construction.

Without a very strong physique and very active physical ability, it is impossible to master new military technologies. Sports activities and cultural learning are equally indispensable activities for building a modernized national defense army. We demand that through the "August 1st" All-Army Sports Meeting, the troops' understanding of sports activities be improved, so that sports activities can be more comprehensively and widely developed in the troops, closely combined with the construction of the troops, and gradually become organized, led, and systematic, becoming an indispensable activity in the daily life of all commanders and fighters. All of these have already shown significant improvements in the preparation process of this sports meeting in our major military regions and various special forces, which is a guarantee for the success of the meeting.

For every athlete participating in the conference, not only are they required to fully demonstrate their excellent skills and take the lead for the entire army with their excellent skills, but also they are required to fully demonstrate their noble sportsmanship in every performance and competition, just as they have done in the past. That is to highly promote revolutionary heroism in every competition, never fall behind, and at the same time be very modest and learn from every competition and performance item.

Comrades! We should carry forward the glorious tradition of our army and use the spirit of combat to welcome the "August 1st" All-Army Sports Meeting. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and with the guidance and assistance of advanced people in the cultural and sports circles and the people of the capital, our conference will surely be successfully convened and completely successful!

### 迎接“八一”建军二十五周年全军体育运动大会

    迎接“八一”建军二十五周年全军体育运动大会
    人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部部长  陈沂
    在人民解放军中广泛开展体育运动，不但能够锻炼我军指挥员战斗员健壮的体格，使身体机能获得更加健全的发展，而且能够培养他们勇敢、坚毅、机敏、灵活和集体主义的优秀品质。苏联将知识教育、道德教育、技术教育、体育教育、美术与美学教育列为共产主义教育的五大部分；体育教育为共产主义教育重要的组成部分之一；苏联军队优秀的统帅和指挥员都十分重视部队的体育训练。
    我军自建军以来就重视体育运动。朱总司令在艰苦万分的红军时代，亦从不忘记在部队中倡导开展可能开展的体育项目。在“论解放区战场”中，他更明确指出：“练兵分三方面，一是智力，二是体力，三是技术。”将体力训练列为训练部队三大内容之一。中央人民政府提倡开展新国民体育运动以后，我军即将体育和军事、政治、文化教育同等重视，列为部队四大训练科目。
    目前朝鲜停战谈判仍未达成协议，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，仍图继续保持国际紧张局势，更加明目张胆地积极准备新的战争。为着巩固我们祖国的国防，加强保卫世界和平的力量，随时打退战争贩子的一切挑拨与侵略，我军正在加速正规化现代化的建设。在这种形势下，今年“八一”，我们在庆祝我军建军二十五周年的时候，召开这样一个盛大的体育运动大会，在部队中大力提倡体育运动，是有着特别重大的意义的。
    我军体育运动，是为部队建设服务，并随着部队的发展而发展的。过去在游击战争时期，根据部队需要和环境条件许可，我们只能在山地就练爬山，在湖泊就练游泳，在草原就练骑术。解放战争时期，我们的部队虽然壮大了，可是因为战争极端频繁，也还不可能在全军开展有组织有计划的体育运动。解放战争结束以后，在建设正规化现代化国防军的练兵运动中，体育运动才逐渐开始有组织有计划地开展起来；特别是在去年举行全军篮球排球比赛以后，各大军区都先后召开了文艺体育大会，体育运动始获得蓬勃的发展。
    然而这并不是说，这样我们就可以认为满足了。现在我们部队体育运动的开展，离开我们部队建设的实际需要还差的很远。其具体表现：第一，有些同志对体育运动还认识不足，还认为体育只是一种单纯的娱乐或游戏；第二，体育运动在部队中的开展还不够全面，其群众性还不够广泛；第三，各兵种还未明确注意到根据自己部队的特殊需要，有意识地在自己部队中大力提倡某几项运动，使体育运动与部队建设更加紧密地结合起来；第四，体育运动还未走向正规化；我们部队中还没有建立正规的体育制度；许多同志还将体育运动看作是短期的、临时的突击任务，开上两个运动会，就认为算是完成了任务，还没有认识到体育运动在部队中应是长期的经常的运动。今年庆祝“八一”建军节，党和上级花费很大的力量来召开这样一个盛大的体育大会，就是要大力克服上述缺点，使部队的体育运动赶上部队建设的需要。
    没有十分健壮的体力和十分活泼的体能，决不可能掌握新的军事技术。体育运动与文化学习同样为建设现代化国防军不可缺少的运动。我们要求通过
    “八一”全军体育运动大会，提高部队对于体育运动的认识，使体育运动在部队中获得更全面更广泛的发展，与部队建设密切结合起来，并逐渐做到有组织、有领导、有制度，成为全体指挥员战斗员日常生活不可缺少的活动。而所有这些，在这一次运动会的筹备过程里，就已在我各大军区、各特种兵中看出了显著改进，这是开好大会的保证。
    对于参加大会的每一个运动员，不仅要求他们充分表演他们优秀的技能，并以他们优秀的技能来为全军带头，而且要求他们在每一项表演和竞赛中充分表现他们的高尚的体育道德，一如他们过去已经表现过的一样。那就是在每一项竞赛中高度发扬革命英雄主义，决不落后，同时又是非常谦虚，向每一竞赛和表演的项目学习。
    全体同志们！应当发扬我军光荣传统，用战斗精神来迎接“八一”全军体育运动大会。我们的大会在中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会领导之下，在文化体育界先进人士和首都人民指导帮助之下，一定能够胜利地召开，圆满地成功！
