The All-China Coal Miners' Trade Union National Committee recently took advantage of the summer vacation of national coal mine tunneling model workers and advanced producers at Beidaihe seaside to concentrate on the innovations in the process of promoting the Ma Liu Hai team's multi-hole circulating operation method in various mines, as well as new experiences in tunneling work in other mines. These were comprehensively compared, and based on the three standards of "high efficiency, good quality, and low cost," the large-diameter deep-hole blasting method of Hongliu Well in Hongshan Coal Mine of Shandong, the hollow blasting method of Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, the one-time continuous blasting method of Fuxin Mining Bureau, and the wind duct ventilation method of the 84th Tunneling Team of Hongshan Coal Mine were finally recognized as advanced experiences in tunneling work. It is hoped that when promoting the advanced tunneling experience of Ma Liu Hai or Cui Guoshan, these new operating methods can be used at the same time to further improve the speed and efficiency of tunneling and continue to reduce costs.

Hongliu Well's Large-Diameter Deep-Hole Blasting Method

The depth of the bore has a great impact on the tunneling speed, but in smaller tunnels, deep holes are generally not used. In small tunnels, if straight holes are drilled, they can be drilled deeper, but most of the blasting force of the explosive is concentrated on the hole mouth where the pressure is lower. As a result, the hole can often only be enlarged a little, or at most the coal seam near the hole is fractured, and the entire coal seam between the holes cannot be blasted out. If inclined holes are drilled, it is difficult to manipulate the drill if it is too deep. The Hongliu Well of Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong solved this problem with the large-diameter deep-hole blasting method. They drill a straight hole with a larger diameter and depth in the well, and no explosives are loaded in this hole. Around the large hole, several straight holes with the same depth as the large hole are drilled. In this way, when the explosives in each straight hole explode, the blasting force squeezes horizontally, and the coal seam between each slot and the large hole can be blasted. The problem of deep-hole operation in small-sized tunnels is solved. The large-diameter deep-hole blasting method also has its advantages in general tunnels. Because, for the same depth of holes, straight holes are blasted deeper than inclined holes; in terms of technical operation, it is easier to drill straight holes than inclined holes; the specifications of the working face after straight-hole blasting are also more uniform; the large-diameter deep-hole blasting has more progress for each blast, which can also reduce the number of blasts and save explosives and detonators. In addition, because the blasting force is concentrated during large-diameter deep-hole blasting, it is not as easy to destroy the shed as inclined-hole blasting. Hongliu Well has achieved remarkable results after adopting this method (they drilled two large holes without explosives, close to each other). Their tunnel has a lower width of 2.8 meters, an upper width of 2.5 meters, a height of 2.3 meters, and a coal thickness of 1.2 meters. In such tunnels, they have drilled holes to a depth of 2.5 meters, and the progress of each blast has reached 2.63 meters, an increase of 75% compared to the past. Explosives are saved by 11%, and detonators are saved by 59%. The tools for drilling large holes are general heavy-duty air drills, only the drill bit needs to be widened appropriately.

Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's Hollow Blasting Method

The explosive loading method also has a great relationship with the tunneling speed. Under normal circumstances, the progress of each blast can only be about the same as the depth of the hole, and it is not easy to exceed it. The reason is that general explosives have a flat bottom and are in complete contact with the coal seam after being loaded into the hole, and the explosive force of the explosive is greatly resisted, so the blasting is not deep. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau uses the hollow blasting method to make the depth of each blast exceed the depth of the hole. The hollow blasting method is to take out a small amount of explosives at the bottom of the explosive, insert a metal funnel into the explosive, and make the bottom of the explosive into an inverted funnel-shaped hollow. In this way, the explosive force is easily concentrated in the gap where there is no resistance, and rushes towards the coal seam. Therefore, the blasting depth can exceed the hole depth a lot. Hollow blasting is generally more suitable for gouging in tunneling work. According to the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's test results of hollow blasting, the depth of hollow blasting often exceeds the hole depth by about 0.43 meters.

Fuxin Mining Bureau's One-Time Continuous Blasting Method

In the blasting work, there is still a difficulty, that is, a blast must be carried out several times. After each blast, before the smoke has completely dissipated, workers must go in to connect the blast with wires. This not only prolongs the blasting time but also harms the health of workers. Zhang Yihou, a model worker in blasting at the Fuxin Mining Bureau, and the electrical and mechanical personnel of their mine have continuously researched and experimented, and found the continuous blasting method of "one-time connection and separate detonation," which solved this problem. In the past, two busbars were used to connect a group of blasts. After the blasts were completed, the workers went in to connect another group. Now, they use three busbars to connect three groups of blasts in series respectively (similarly, using four busbars can connect six groups of blasts), and then detonate them in groups in order. After Zhang Yihou's team implemented this method, the blasting time was shortened by more than half, and the team performed one more blast per shift than before. However, when using this continuous blasting method, attention must also be paid to some technical issues, and this continuous blasting method can only be applied to mines without gas or with very little gas.

The 84th Tunneling Team's Wind Duct Ventilation Method

When studying the Ma Liu Hai multi-hole circulating operation method, the 84th Tunneling Team of Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong created a ventilation method using wind ducts, which eliminated the wind roadway and cross pipes, solved the ventilation problem of thin coal seams, and reduced costs. Most general roadway layouts consist of one tunneling straight roadway, one wind roadway, and one cross pipe. The wind roadway and cross pipe are generally only used as return air roadways during tunneling, and are rarely useful during mining except for steeply inclined coal seams. For thin coal seams like Hongshan Coal Mine, a rock bottom of more than one meter must be dug in the straight roadway to make it easier to work. If the wind roadway and cross pipe are also dug with rock bottoms, it will be too laborious and the cost will be too high. In order to overcome this difficulty, when the straight roadway is tunneled forward, Hongshan Mine opens up 1.5 meters more of the upper gang of the coal seam. Then, on the rock floor of the wind roadway, a row of dense props are placed one centimeter away from the straight roadway gang, and smeared with yellow mud to separate it from the straight roadway to form a wind duct to replace the wind roadway and cross pipe. This ventilation method can save labor and explosives compared to making cross pipes and wind roadways. At the same time, all the wooden pillars can also be recovered. The wind duct can be used as a chute during mining, and the coal pillars can also be kept without loss during mining. This is a good ventilation method in thin coal seam mines.

Opinions on Unified Leadership and Labor Organization

In the exchange of experience, the practical experience of various mines has proved that in order to implement rapid tunneling, because there are many types of work and close cooperation is required, unified leadership must be implemented. Otherwise, disconnection will occur, affecting the regular circulating operation. In terms of organizational structure, everyone believes that there should not be too many levels of leadership. Too many levels can easily lead to disconnection between upper and lower levels and a sluggish work attitude. In terms of labor organization, the division of labor must be clear. A clear division of labor is an effective way to implement the responsibility system and improve technology. However, various types of work must cooperate closely to ensure that the work is carried out in an orderly manner according to the instructions and charts.

In the process of exchanging experiences, the political and ideological level of labor models, advanced producers, and technical personnel in various mines has been greatly improved. At the beginning, everyone always felt that their own experience was good, but after taking out the standards and comparing various experiences together, it became clear which was good and which was bad. Everyone sincerely expressed their willingness to learn from the experiences of fraternal mines. In the process of exchanging experiences, it was revealed that some mines are still hindered by conservative ideas when learning advanced experiences. It is inevitable to encounter some difficulties and make some necessary reforms when learning or creating advanced experiences. In this case, many administrative and trade union leaders and technical personnel do not actively and proactively lead workers to find ways to overcome difficulties, but instead retreat and do not seek improvement. Everyone severely criticized this idea. Those with this shortcoming also expressed their willingness to thoroughly criticize conservative ideas, bravely overcome difficulties, and learn advanced experiences.

At the expanded bureau affairs meeting of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry at the end of June, the Coal Mine Management Bureau has instructed various mines in North China and East China that in the future, when promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai team, the above-mentioned operating methods must be used as a component of the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai team and earnestly promoted.

    中国煤矿工会全国委员会
    继续总结煤矿掘进工作中各种新创造
    中国煤矿工会全国委员会，最近趁各国营煤矿的掘进劳动模范和先进生产者到北戴河海滨作暑期休养之际，集中了各矿推广马六孩小组多孔道循环作业法过程中的创造，以及其他各矿掘进工作中的新经验，加以综合比较，并根据“效率高、质量好、成本低”三项标准，最后肯定了山东洪山煤矿洪六井的大眼深孔爆破法，焦作矿务局的空心放炮法，阜新矿务局的一次连炮方法，以及洪山煤矿八四掘进队的夹风道通风办法等项掘进工作中的先进经验。并希望在推广马六孩或崔国山的先进掘进经验时，能够同时运用这些新的操作方法，以使掘进的进度和效率进一步提高，使成本继续降低。
    洪六井的大眼深孔爆破法
    打眼的深度对于掘进进度有很大影响，可是在规格较小的巷道中，一般是不用深眼的。在小巷道中，假使打直眼，可以打得较深，但炮药的爆破力量大部集中在压力较小的炮眼口上，结果就常常只能把炮眼崩大一点，至多把炮眼附近的煤层震裂一些，而不能把各个炮眼中间的煤层整个崩出来；如果打斜眼，打深了钎子就摆弄不开。山东洪山煤矿洪六井用大眼深孔爆破的办法解决了这个问题。他们在井内打一个直径较大和较深的直眼，这个眼内不装炮药。在大眼周围，再打成几个和大眼深度相等的直眼，这样，各个直眼中的炮药爆炸时，爆破力量向横挤，就可以把各槽眼与大眼间的煤层爆裂，在规格小的巷道内深孔作业的问题解决了。大眼深孔爆破的方法，在一般的巷道中，同样有它的优越性。因为，同样深的炮眼，直眼要比斜眼的爆破进度深；在技术操作上打直眼也比打斜眼容易；直眼爆破后工作面的规格也比较整齐；大眼深孔爆破每次炮的进度多，也可减少放炮次数，节省火药雷管。另外，由于大眼深孔爆破时爆破的力量集中，不像斜眼爆破时容易炸毁棚子。洪六井采用了这种办法后（他们是打两个不装药的大眼，两眼互相靠近），已获得显著的成效。他们的巷道下宽二点八公尺，上宽二点五公尺，高二点三公尺，煤厚一点二公尺。在这样的巷道中，他们打眼的深度已到二点五公尺，每楂炮进度则达到二点六三公尺，较过去提高了百分之七十五。火药节省百分之十一，雷管节省了百分之五十九。打大眼的工具用一般的重型风钻，只须把钎子头适当加宽就可以。
    焦作矿务局的空心放炮法
    装炮方法对于掘进进度也有很大关系。在一般情况下，每一次炮的进度只能和炮眼的深度差不多，不易超过。原因是一般的炮药是平底，装进炮眼后和煤层完全接触，炮药的爆炸力受到抵抗力很大，因而爆破不深。焦作矿务局用空心放炮的方法，使每次爆破的深度超过了炮眼的深度。空心放炮的办法是：把炮药底部取出少许，用一金属漏斗插入炮药，使炮药底部成反漏斗形的空心。这样爆炸力量容易集中于没有抵抗力量的空隙处，冲向煤层，因而，爆破深度可以超过炮眼深度很多。焦作矿务局试验空心炮的结果，空心炮爆破的深度经常超过炮眼深度零点四三公尺左右。空心炮在掘进工作中一般应用于掏槽较为合适。
    阜新矿务局的一次连炮方法
    在放炮的工作中，目前还有一个困难，这就是，一楂炮要分几次放，每放完一次炮，炮烟还没有完全消散，工人就须进去用电线连一次炮。既延长放炮时间，又伤害工人健康。阜新矿务局爆破劳动模范张义厚和他们矿的机电人员不断研究试验，找出了“一次连炮，分别发爆”的连炮方法，解决了这个问题。过去，都是用两根母线连结一组炮，放完了，工人再进去连结另一组，现在他们则是用三根母线分别串连三组炮（同样使用四根母线就可以联结六组炮），然后依序一组组爆发。张义厚小组实行了这个办法后，缩短了一半以上的放炮时间，小组每班比以前多放一遍炮。但使用这种连炮方法时，还须要注意一些技术问题，并且这种连炮方法只能适用于没有瓦斯或瓦斯很少的矿山。
    八四掘进队的夹风道通风办法
    山东洪山煤矿八四掘进队在学习马六孩多孔道循环作业法时，创造了用夹风道通风的办法，取消了风巷和横管，解决了薄煤层的通风问题，并且降低了成本。一般的巷道布置大多是一个掘进正巷一个风巷一个横管。风巷和横管一般的只是在掘进时作为回风的巷道，回采时除急倾斜煤层外很少有用处。像洪山煤矿这样薄的煤层，正巷中须要打一公尺多的石头底，工作起来才方便，风巷和横管假若也打石头底，费工太大，成本太高。为了克服这一困难，洪山矿在正巷向前掘进时，将上帮的煤层多开一点五公尺，然后，在风巷岩石底板上距正巷帮一公寸的地方打密集支柱一排，用黄泥涂抹，使与正巷隔开，成为夹风道，用以代替风道和横管。这种通风方法比作横管和风道可以节省人工和火药，同时木柱也可全部回收，夹风道在回采时可以做溜子道，回采时还可以不丢失煤柱。在薄煤层的矿山，这是一种很好的通风办法。
    对统一领导与劳动组织的意见
    在交流经验中，各矿山的实际经验证明，在实行快速掘进时，因为工种较多，又须密切配合，因之必须实行统一领导，否则便会发生脱节现象，影响正规的循环作业。在组织机构方面，大家认为领导层次不宜过多。层次过多，便容易发生上下脱节工作疲沓现象，在劳动组织方面，分工必须明确，分工明确是实行专责制和提高技术的有效办法。但各工种必须密切配合，这样才能保证有条不紊地按指示图表进行工作。
    在交流经验的过程中，各矿的劳动模范、先进生产者、技术人员的政治思想水平都有很大的提高。开始，大家总是感到自己的经验好，但经过拿出标准，把各种经验放在一起比较研究，那个好，那个不好就很清楚了。大家都诚恳地表示愿意学习兄弟矿山的经验。在交流经验过程中，暴露出有些矿山在学习先进经验时还受保守思想的羁绊。在学习或创造先进经验中必不可免地要遇到一些困难，须要进行一些必要的改革。很多行政、工会的领导干部、技术人员在这种情况下，不是积极主动地领导工人想办法克服困难，而是向后退缩不求改进。大家对这种思想进行了严正的批判。有这种缺点的也都表示要彻底批判保守思想，勇敢地克服困难，学习先进经验。
    在六月底中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局的扩大局务会议上，煤矿管理总局已指示华北华东各矿，今后在推广马六孩小组的先进经验时，必须把上述操作法作为马六孩小组先进经验的一个组成部分，认真加以推广。（中国煤矿工会全国委员会通讯组）
