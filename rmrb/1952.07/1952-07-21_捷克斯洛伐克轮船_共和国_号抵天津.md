Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 20th: The Czechoslovak Republic's ship "Republic," fully loaded with goods stipulated in the Sino-Czech trade agreement for import to China, arrived in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 16th. Those who went to the port to welcome the ship included: Yang Shiren, Deputy Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government; Liu Jinsheng, representative of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and Deputy Manager of the China Overseas Transportation Company; Liu Dachao, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union; and Zhang Wenjin, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, and others. The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Czechoslovak Republic to China, Mr. Kang Sala, and members of the embassy also went to welcome the ship and held a welcome reception on board. Political Commissar Mara of the ship delivered a speech, saying that he was extremely excited about the Czechoslovakian ship's arrival in China this time. Ambassador Kang Sala of Czechoslovakia pointed out in his speech: With the help of the fraternal country of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic not only has its own seaport, but also has its own ships that can travel across the oceans to China. This is something to be excited about. This is not only of great significance for trade cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia and for smashing the so-called "economic blockade" of American imperialism, but it will also play a significant role in promoting friendship between the two countries and safeguarding world peace. Yang Shiren, Deputy Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government, expressed cordial greetings and appreciation in his welcoming speech to all the crew members for overcoming numerous difficulties and traveling across the oceans to China. On the evening of the 17th, Huang Jing, Mayor of Tianjin, held a banquet to welcome Political Commissar Mara of the ship and others.
    Political Commissar Mara of the ship and eleven crew members, accompanied by Deputy Director Yang Shiren, left Tianjin for Beijing on the 18th for a visit. Ambassador Kang Sala and others also returned to Beijing in the same vehicle.
