(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang) The Korean People's Delegation to China held its first homecoming report meeting in Pyongyang on the evening of the 1st, with delegation leader Hong Sun-cheol giving a report on the visit to China. The delegation also decided to conduct continuous homecoming reports in groups throughout northern Korea during July and August, and to exhibit photographs, banners, letters, and other souvenirs presented by the Chinese people, in order to further inspire the patriotic and internationalist spirit of the Korean military and civilians and strengthen the militant friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China.

More than 800 people, including representatives of the working people of Pyongyang, cadres of institutions, officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, attended the delegation's first homecoming report meeting. In his report, delegation leader Hong Sun-cheol explained the significance and process of the delegation's visit to China, and vividly described the warm welcome the delegation received from the people all over China. He said: Through the enthusiasm of the Chinese people and the voices of the Chinese people, our delegation to China more clearly understood the enthusiasm and voices of the peace-loving people of the world who warmly support the Korean people. We brought back the conclusion that victory will surely belong to the Korean people.

Hong Sun-cheol gave a detailed introduction to the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing thrift, economic and cultural construction, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. He said: The delegation clearly saw the great face of the new China appearing in the world with the tremendous achievements of domestic construction and the international victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The achievements and victories gained by the Chinese people have not only promoted the recovery and development of the Chinese people's economy and strengthened China's national strength, but have also dealt a severe blow to the war-mongers headed by the U.S. imperialists. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working masses are continuing to carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese people's courage, diligence, and simplicity, and are bravely advancing to win greater victories in the cause of the boundless prosperity and development of the new China and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

Hong Sun-cheol pointed out: The brotherly friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China, which has a long history, has become even more consolidated like iron and stone through the war of resistance against U.S. aggression. The rapid development and increasing strength of the great friendly country, New China, has further strengthened the heroic Korean people's confidence in victory in their just Fatherland Liberation War to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland. Hong Sun-cheol called on the entire Korean people to further strengthen international friendship and solidarity with the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries. The unbreakable unity of the world peace and democracy camp is an important guarantee for our victory.

Hong Sun-cheol's report was often interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience. After the report, all attendees unanimously passed a letter of thanks to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people with thunderous applause.

The letter of thanks to Chairman Mao said: After hearing the homecoming report of the Korean People's Delegation to China, we are filled with even more gratitude and respect for you, our beloved, and the entire Chinese people. We have once again deeply realized how warmly and powerfully you and the entire Chinese people under your leadership are supporting us. You and the entire Chinese people welcomed our delegation with feelings as close as flesh and blood and gave us deep care. We would like to express our warm gratitude to you and wish you a long life for the sake of the more consolidated unity and victory of the peoples of Korea and China, and for the happiness of the Chinese people.

The letter of thanks to the Chinese people said: Through the delegation's detailed report, we know more clearly that you are doing everything possible to win greater victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression and are enthusiastically supporting the Korean people. Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, you have rapidly restored the people's economy in the short period since the founding of New China, and have achieved brilliant and splendid achievements in various construction undertakings. This great fact makes us, the Korean people, feel infinitely happy and strengthens our confidence in victory. We are determined to further strengthen the fraternal friendship and fighting solidarity with the great Chinese people, and express our deep gratitude to you for welcoming our delegation with fraternal affection. We sincerely wish you greater achievements and more glorious victories in the great cause of people's democratic construction and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
