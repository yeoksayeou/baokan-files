    Active Trading at the Central South China Materials Exchange Fair

    The Central South China Materials Exchange Fair has seen active trading since its opening on the 10th. The leadership of the conference has organized various professional meetings and forums with representatives from different regions to facilitate rapid trading. Wuhan's state-owned trading companies, which had a large stock of general hardware, transportation and telecommunications equipment, and chemical raw materials, concluded transactions worth over 20 billion yuan with industrial equipment companies from various regions after a professional meeting on industrial equipment was held. Wuhan grain merchants purchased a large amount of miscellaneous grains from the Hubei Provincial State-owned Trading Company after a grain professional meeting. State-owned economic departments took care of private industrialists and businessmen during the transactions, meeting their purchasing and sales requirements to facilitate the exchange of materials. A large number of special agricultural products such as live pigs and eggs, which had been slow to sell in the vast rural areas of Central South China, have been successfully sold at this conference.

    Southwest China Materials Exchange Fair Opens

    The Southwest China Materials Exchange Fair opened in Chongqing on July 21st. It was attended by more than 840 representatives and purchasing and sales teams of public and private industrialists and businessmen from various provinces and regions in Southwest China, various ethnic minorities, major administrative regions, and major cities across the country. At the opening ceremony, Chen Xiyun, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, said in his opening speech that the task of this conference is to invigorate the exchange of local products, special products, and industrial products between regions, strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and promote industrial and agricultural production in a planned way. The CPC committees and people's governments at all levels in Southwest China attach great importance to this materials exchange conference. Preparations for the conference began in early June. All relevant departments also fully supported the conference. The Chongqing Branch of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Navigation Administration decided to offer an 85% discount on shipping fees for goods traded at the conference. The People's Bank of China offered discounting services, and the state-owned Southwest United Transportation Company reduced its service fees by 10%. Tax, postal and telecommunications, insurance and other departments have also formulated preferential measures and set up service points at the conference to facilitate customers. Encouraged and supported by the People's Government, private industrialists and businessmen actively participated in the conference. Representatives of private industrialists and businessmen accounted for 60% of the total number of participants. The conference is divided into three exchanges: local products, general merchandise, and industrial equipment. The conference is scheduled to last for fifteen days.

    Business of Private Enterprises in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua Improves

    Private industrialists and businessmen in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua in Chahar Province are actively operating their businesses, and their business is improving. At present, most industrial and commercial households have increased their capital. In Zhangjiakou, nine industries, including silk and cloth and general merchandise, increased their capital by more than 370 million yuan in one instance. Twenty-seven households in ten industries, including bricks and tiles and fur, added a total of 176 workers. Many capitalists took out off-the-books funds and gold to expand their businesses. Xuanhua's market has also become more active due to the active operation of private merchants. Workers and shop assistants in various places have taken the initiative to unite with capitalists to develop production. In Zhangjiakou, in the fur industry, which had the most serious violations of law in the past, some capitalists were once passive after the "Five-Anti" campaign, leaving a large number of furs to become moth-eaten and rotten. The grassroots trade union led the workers to turn over and dry all the furs of each household or sprinkle them with medicine, preserving all the inventory. This action prompted thirteen capitalists to actively expand their capital and go to the countryside to purchase goods.

    Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings Held by Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in Wuhan

    Many private industrial and commercial enterprises in Wuhan have recently held labor-capital consultation meetings to promote production. From mid-June to mid-July, nearly 200 temporary labor-capital agreements have been signed in 75 major industries across the city. These meetings were initiated by workers who wanted to unite with capitalists to develop production. Labor-capital relations have become normal in industries where labor-capital consultation meetings have been held. Workers are able to work hard and capitalists are actively engaged in legitimate business operations. 97% of the capitalists in the silk and cloth industry in Wuhan have participated in the Central South China Materials Exchange Fair and have formulated a purchase and sales plan of 70 billion yuan; and from July, some store employees have launched business competitions.

    Excessive Working Hours in Private Textile Factories in Southern Jiangsu Affect Workers' Health

    At present, the working hours in private textile factories in southern Jiangsu are 11 hours per shift, or even 11 and a half hours. Due to excessive working hours, workers are excessively fatigued, and the absenteeism rate is generally 20%, and as high as 50% in individual workshops. Miscarriage among female workers is serious. After work, workers have no energy to study politics, culture, and technology. Because workers' health is impaired, work efficiency is very low, and the daily output of each spindle in each factory for 23 hours is only about one pound. The Labor Department of the Central People's Government has ordered the Labor Department of the East China Military and Administrative Committee to supervise the factories to implement the uniform working hours regulations of the People's Government and shorten working hours.

    Note: Article 32 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "Public and private enterprises should generally implement an eight- to ten-hour work system." On December 30, 1950, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central Government notified all localities: "From January 1951, the working hours of each shift in public and private factories that operate two shifts shall not exceed ten hours; for those operating three shifts, the daily working hours shall not exceed 23 hours (the other one hour can be used for rest and meals)."

    State-owned Grain Company and Cooperatives in Hunan Province Prepare to Purchase New Rice

    The state-owned grain company and cooperatives in Hunan Province are actively preparing to purchase rice. The early rice in the province is being harvested, and the middle rice will be on the market next month. The state-owned grain company sent people to various places two months ago to understand the production and sales of rice. Grain branches and sub-branches in various places have also repaired warehouses, set up grain purchase stations in rice-producing areas, and signed entrusted purchase contracts with local cooperatives. Grain companies in Changde, Yiyang and other places have printed a large number of publicity materials to encourage farmers to improve the quality of grain and organize farmers to sell grain collectively. The Hunan Provincial Grain Company, the Cooperative Affairs Administration, and local people's governments have held separate meetings to specifically discuss grain purchase work. In addition, state-owned trade departments and cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province have decided to launch an industrial product promotion campaign throughout the province from August to meet the needs of farmers for industrial products after selling their grain. Hunan Province is one of the major rice-producing areas in China. Most areas of the province have completed land reform; this year, the province launched a patriotic production increase campaign. Barring unforeseen disasters, rice production will increase by 10% to 20% compared with last year.

    Good Harvest of Scientific Method Planted Wheat Crops in Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xikang Province

    Wheat crops planted using selected seeds and scientific methods in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province have had a good harvest this year. Farmers in Lengqi Township, Luding County, harvested more than twice as much of the improved wheat variety "Zhongda 2419" as they did of the local wheat. The Soviet wheat used by the Qianning Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Experiment Station not only grew well but was also able to resist drought. The barley and wheat grown by farmers in the region in the past had a lot of smut. This year, after warm water soaking and seed dressing with medicine, the smut has been greatly reduced. According to surveys in Kangding Yala, Yulin, and other places, the amount of smut in wheat and barley sown after soaking has been reduced by two-thirds compared to last year.

    苏南各私营纺织厂工时过长影响职工健康
    目前苏南各私营纺织厂的工作时间每班十一小时，甚至十一小时半。由于工时过长，工人过分疲劳，缺勤率一般在百分之二十，个别车间高达百分之五十。女工流产现象严重。工人下工后，已完全没有精力再学习政治、文化和技术。工人因身体健康受到损害，工作效率很低，各厂每锭每日二十三小时的产量仅在一磅左右。中央人民政府劳动部已命令华东军政委员会劳动部监督各厂执行人民政府统一工时规定，缩短工时。
    按：共同纲领三十二条明文规定：“公私企业目前一般应实行八小时至十小时的工作制。”一九五○年十二月三十日中央纺织工业部通知各地：“自一九五一年一月起，全国公私营各厂开二班制者，每班工作不得超过十小时；三班制者，每日工作不得超过二十三小时（其他一小时可作休息吃饭用）。”
