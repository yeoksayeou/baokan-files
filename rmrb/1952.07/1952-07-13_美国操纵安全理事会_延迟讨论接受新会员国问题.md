Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations Security Council meeting on the 9th began to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal to recommend that the United Nations General Assembly approve the simultaneous admission of fourteen countries that had already applied to join the United Nations. The United States representative had previously expressed unwillingness to consider the issue of admitting new member states. Before the 9th meeting even began substantive discussions on the Soviet proposal, the representatives of the US-British bloc, disregarding Soviet opposition, passed a Greek suggestion to postpone the discussion of the Soviet proposal until September 2nd.

    美国操纵安全理事会
　　延迟讨论接受新会员国问题
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会九日会议开始讨论苏联代表团的提案：建议联合国大会批准十四个已经申请加入联合国的国家同时加入联合国。美国代表在事先就已表示不愿意审议接受新会员国的问题。九日会议还未对苏联提案展开实质上的讨论，美英集团代表就不顾苏联的反对通过了希腊的建议，把苏联提案延迟到九月二日再讨论。
