    The East China Military and Political Committee recently issued instructions on conducting a general safety and hygiene inspection of factories and mines. The instructions require all provinces (regions) and cities to select a time within the third and fourth quarters of this year to concentrate efforts and, in conjunction with production reforms, conduct a general safety and hygiene inspection of all state-owned, publicly owned, and joint public-private industrial and mining enterprises. For private industrial and mining enterprises, except for those that already have the necessary conditions, the general practice this year will be to first establish and strengthen safety and hygiene work and prepare for a general inspection in the spring of next year. The instructions emphasized that labor protection is one of the important programs of the People's Government, that safety and hygiene work is an important measure for specifically implementing the policy of labor protection, and that it is a necessary condition for wholeheartedly relying on the working class to develop production. Doing a good job in safety and hygiene work is a major political task for ensuring the safety and health of employees, protecting state property, achieving safe production increases, and improving enterprise management. Only by attaching great importance to and doing a good job in this work can we further enhance the political awareness and production enthusiasm of employees, thereby increasing production and improving management. Therefore, all localities should closely integrate this work with the production reforms that are being carried out or are about to be carried out in state-owned, publicly owned, and joint public-private industrial and mining enterprises, making it an important part and component of production reform. The instructions pointed out that the basic principle of the inspection must be to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, so that the inspection work becomes a widespread mass movement. The administrative safety and hygiene systems and technical operating procedures should all be discussed and revised by the masses and mastered by the masses. Enterprise administrations should widely solicit opinions and requests from the masses regarding safety and hygiene work, launch rationalization proposals, organize discussions, and study improvement measures, so that the inspection work can be effectively carried out with the enthusiastic participation and support of the masses.
    In order to unify and strengthen the leadership of this major inspection, the instructions stipulate that large and medium-sized cities with a large number of state-owned, publicly owned, and joint public-private industrial and mining enterprises should form industrial and mining safety and hygiene inspection committees jointly by relevant government departments, enterprise management agencies, and trade unions, with the mayor as the chairman and the chairman of the trade union or the director of the labor bureau as the vice-chairman.
                        
    After the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Labor Department, Industry Department, Health Department, and the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions issued a joint directive on conducting a general safety and hygiene inspection in all public and private factories and mining enterprises in the Northwest, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, Health Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other relevant units decided to conduct a general safety and hygiene inspection of all public and private factories and enterprises (including construction, handicraft textile, trade, and transportation industries) within the city in July and August, and established the Xi'an City Factory and Enterprise Safety and Hygiene Inspection Committee on July 9th, and officially began the inspection on August 1st. During the inspection process, all units are required to closely integrate it with the current task of increasing production and practicing economy and the patriotic health campaign. At the same time, it is necessary to fully mobilize the workers and create a mass movement to achieve everyone's participation, hands-on approach, and brainstorming. It is not only necessary to discover and expose problems, but also to come up with solutions. For problems that cannot be solved immediately, the administrative aspects or capitalists of each factory and enterprise can formulate a step-by-step improvement plan based on needs, possible conditions, and the importance and urgency of the problems, and designate a special person to be responsible for completing it within a specified time limit.
    Currently, the city's Safety and Hygiene Inspection Committee has made all preparations and established a short-term training class. More than 280 cadres from various units participating in the inspection work began their professional studies on the 15th. After graduation, they will return to various factory and mining enterprises and, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Safety and Hygiene Inspection Committee, mobilize the workers to carry out safety and hygiene inspection work.

    华东军政委员会指示所属各省、市
    普遍进行厂矿安全卫生大检查
    西安市公私厂矿安全卫生检查工作定于“八一”开始
    华东军政委员会最近发布关于进行厂矿安全卫生大检查的指示。指示要求各省（区）、市在今年三、四两季度内，选择时间，集中力量，结合生产改革，对各国营、公营、公私合营的工矿企业普遍进行一次安全卫生大检查。对私营工矿企业，除个别已具备条件者外，一般的可在今年内首先建立与加强安全卫生工作，作好准备，待明年春季再进行普遍检查。指示着重指出：劳动保护是人民政府的重要纲领之一，安全卫生工作是具体执行劳动保护政策的重要措施，也是全心全意依靠工人阶级发展生产的必要条件；做好安全卫生工作，是保障职工生命安全与身体健康、保护国家财产，实现安全增产、改进企业管理的重大政治任务。只有十分重视并做好这一工作，才能更加提高职工的政治觉悟与生产积极性，从而增加生产，改进管理。因此，各地应将这一工作与正在开展或即将开展的国营、公营、公私合营工矿企业中的生产改革密切结合起来，使之成为生产改革的重要内容与组成部分。指示指出：检查的基本方针，必须是充分发动群众，依靠群众，使检查工作成为广泛的群众性运动。行政上制订的安全卫生制度与技术操作规程，都应经过群众讨论、修订，并为群众所掌握；企业行政应广泛征求群众对于安全卫生工作的意见和要求，开展合理化建议，组织讨论，研究改进办法，使检查工作在群众热烈地参加与支持下有力地开展。
    为了统一并加强这次大检查的领导，指示规定各国营、公营、公私合营工矿企业较多的大、中城市，应由政府各有关部门、企业管理机关与工会共同组成工矿安全卫生检查委员会，以市长为主任委员、工会主席或劳动局长为副主任委员。

    西北军政委员会劳动部、工业部、卫生部及西北总工会发布关于在西北各公私营厂矿企业中普遍进行安全卫生大检查的联合指示后，西安市人民政府劳动局、卫生局及市总工会等有关单位，决定于七、八两月份在全市范围内各公私营工厂、企业（包括建筑、手纺、贸易、搬运各业在内）普遍进行一次安全卫生大检查，并于七月九日成立了西安市工厂、企业安全卫生大检查委员会，于八月一日起正式开始检查。在检查过程中，要求各单位必须与当前增产节约任务及爱国卫生运动紧密结合起来。同时要充分发动工人，造成一个群众性的运动，以达到大家动手、动脑，人人检查。不但要发现和暴露问题，还要想出解决问题的办法。各工厂、企业行政方面或资方，对一时不能解决的问题，可依据需要与可能条件及轻重缓急，制订出有步骤的改进计划，并指定专人负责限期完成。
    现在，该市安全卫生大检查委员会，已进行了一切准备工作，并成立了短期训练班；参加检查工作的各单位干部二百八十多人，已于十五日起开始业务学习，结业后，即分别回到各厂矿企业单位，在市安全卫生大检查委员会统一领导下，发动工人群众，进行安全卫生检查工作。
