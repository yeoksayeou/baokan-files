    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: All the POWs in our side's No. 9 POW camp, which suffered a savage bombing by American planes, held a protest meeting on the 12th. This meeting was held before they were to mournfully bury their dead comrades.
    The POWs, holding signs that read "Demand the US Military Stop Bombing and Killing POWs" spoke out in anger, denouncing the bloody crime of the United States bombing POW camps with clear markings in violation of its word. POW Woo Hoo-jo said at the meeting: The Americans launched the war of aggression against Korea in order to turn Korea into their colony, and they threatened us with guns and knives to make us cannon fodder for them. After we were captured by the People's Army, we received humanitarian treatment from the government of the Republic in accordance with the Geneva Convention, lived a happy new life, and looked forward to the realization of the armistice and returning home soon. However, the US side is playing tricks to undermine the armistice negotiations on the issue of POW repatriation. After the negotiating parties provided the location of the POW camp, American planes bombed our POW camp with clear markings. These provocative acts by the US military were all planned.
    The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of protest. The letter of protest stated: We, all the POWs, denounce the Americans who violate human morality and massacre the Korean people with national hatred and righteous anger. We appeal to kind people all over the world: immediately stop this atrocity by the Americans, and immediately stop the bombing atrocity against us POWs. We firmly demand that the US authorities guarantee that they will not commit such atrocities in the future, resolve the issue of POW repatriation on the basis of the Geneva Convention, and realize the Korean armistice. We demand that they no longer violate our legitimate demands to return home early and live a peaceful life. We demand the punishment of these criminals who violated international law and bilateral agreements and massacred many of our comrades.

    我方第九号战俘营全体俘虏举行大会
    抗议美机炸杀俘虏的野蛮暴行
    【新华社平壤十七日电】遭受美机野蛮轰炸的我方第九号战俘营里的全体俘虏十二日举行抗议大会。这个大会是在他们将要沉痛地埋葬死难同伴之前举行的。
    俘虏们愤激地举着“要求美军停止炸杀俘虏”的标语，纷纷发言斥责美国背信地轰炸设有明显标志的俘虏营的血腥罪行。俘虏禹厚祚在会上说：美国人为了变朝鲜为其殖民地而发动侵朝战争，他们用枪刀威胁我们给他们当炮灰。我们被人民军俘虏以后，受到共和国政府按照日内瓦公约所给予的人道主义的待遇，过着快乐的新生活，并期待着停战实现、早日回家。但是美方却在俘虏遣返问题上玩弄破坏停战谈判的手法。当谈判双方提供了俘虏营的位置以后，美机竟又轰炸了我们的置有明显标志的俘虏营。美军的这些挑衅行为，全是有计划地制造出来的。
    大会一致通过了抗议书。抗议书写道：我们全体俘虏以民族的仇恨心和正义的愤怒痛斥违反人类道德、大量屠杀朝鲜人民的美国人。我们向全世界善良的人士呼吁：立即制止美国人的这种暴行，立即制止他们加予我们俘虏的轰炸暴行。我们坚决要求美国当局保证今后不再制造这种暴行，以日内瓦公约为基础解决战俘遣返问题，实现朝鲜停战。我们要求他们不再违反我们早日回家过和平生活的正当要求。我们要求处罚这些违反国际公法和双方协议，虐杀我们许多同伴的罪犯。
