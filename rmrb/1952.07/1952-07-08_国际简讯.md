International Briefs

China Peace Committee Cables Condolences on the Death of Picola
　　The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace sent a cable to the Finnish-Chinese Association on the 4th, expressing condolences on the death of Picola, the chairman of the association. The cable said: The Chinese people will never forget Mr. Picola, he was a faithful friend of the Chinese people and a comrade-in-arms of people of all countries in the struggle to defend peace.

Romania Appoints Bujic as Minister of Foreign Affairs
　　The Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly issued an order to remove Anna Pauker from her position as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania, and appointed Bujic to succeed her as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Representatives of the Soviet Union and Other Countries Support the Proposal to Discuss the Tunisian Issue
　　Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Malik wrote to UN Acting Secretary-General Picko, saying that the Soviet Union supports the proposal by the permanent representatives of Egypt, India, and thirteen other countries to the United Nations to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to immediately review the continuing tense situation in Tunisia. Representatives of Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Bolivia, Guatemala, and El Salvador have also notified the UN Secretariat that they support the above-mentioned request of the thirteen Asian and Arab countries. According to the UN Secretariat, the Secretariat received a telegram from the US government, which stated in essence: the US government does not support the request of the thirteen Asian and Arab countries to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Tunisian issue.

　　The request of the thirteen Asian and Arab countries was submitted to UN Secretary-General Lie in mid-June. After the French colonial authorities arrested and exiled the former Tunisian nationalist government in late March, and the French stooge Bakush organized a puppet government, these thirteen countries requested the Security Council to discuss the Tunisian issue. However, the United States, Britain, and France, fearing that the discussion of the Tunisian issue by the United Nations would inevitably lead to a new upsurge in the national independence movements in the Near, Middle East, and North Africa, thereby greatly undermining their plan to establish aggressive bases, manipulated their voting machine in the Security Council and played the trick of abstention, rejecting the request of the thirteen Asian and Arab countries on April 14.

Japanese People Mourn the Martyred Gaoqiao Zhenfu and Others
　　Under the auspices of the Japanese National Relief Association, the Japanese people held a memorial service at Honganji Temple in Asakusa, Tokyo on June 26, to publicly bury the patriotic martyrs Gaoqiao Zhenfu and others who were killed by the US and Japanese reactionaries in the "May 1st" and "May 30th" patriotic movements. After the memorial service, the masses held a demonstration. They protested against the reactionaries' brutal suppression and opposed the fascist "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." Their placards read: "Yankees go home!"

Chilean Laboring People Oppose the Military Agreement with the United States
　　The Chilean working people resolutely oppose the military mutual assistance agreement concluded between the United States and Chile. American newspapers reported: On July 3, the Chilean authorities mobilized a large number of police armed with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas to prevent further anti-American "disturbances" because the Senate was continuing to discuss the US-Chile military mutual assistance agreement. Near the Capitol in Santiago, police cut off all traffic and prohibited gatherings. In the mining and industrial center of Concepcion, labor and textile unions organized a 24-hour strike to protest this enslaving agreement.

Danish People Protest Ridgway's Visit to Copenhagen
　　Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggressive Forces, Ridgway, arrived in Copenhagen on July 3, and was met with angry protests from the Danish working people. On the evening of the 3rd, after Ridgway arrived in Copenhagen, groups of Copenhagen residents demonstrated in front of the hotel where Ridgway was staying, chanting, "Ridgway, go home!" At the same time, many protest meetings were held in Copenhagen. Speakers at the meetings unanimously demanded that the Danish government stop implementing its war policy, General Ridgway return home, and Denmark withdraw from the North Atlantic Aggressive Group.

    罗马尼亚任命布吉克为外交部部长
    罗马尼亚国民议会主席团发布命令，解除安娜·波克现所担任的罗马尼亚外交部部长职务，并任命布吉克继任外交部部长。
    苏联等国代表支持讨论突尼斯问题的建议
    苏联驻联合国常任代表马立克写信给联合国代理秘书长皮科说：苏联支持埃及、印度等十三国驻联合国的常任代表要求召开联合国大会特别会议立即审议关于突尼斯局势继续紧张的问题的建议。白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、玻利维亚、危地马拉和萨尔瓦多等国代表也通知联合国秘书处，他们支持亚洲和阿拉伯十三国的上述要求。而据联合国秘书处报道：秘书处收到美国政府的电报，大意说：美国政府不支持亚洲和阿拉伯十三国关于召开联合国大会特别会议以讨论突尼斯问题的要求。
    亚洲和阿拉伯十三国的这个要求，是在六月中旬向联合国秘书长赖伊提出的。这十三个国家在法国殖民当局于三月下旬逮捕和放逐前突尼斯民族主义的政府，并由法国的走卒巴库士组织傀儡政府以后，曾经要求安全理事会讨论突尼斯问题。但是，美、英、法三国因为害怕联合国对突尼斯问题的讨论必然要引起近、中东和北非民族独立运动的新高潮，从而大大打击它们建立侵略基地的计划，于是操纵它们在安全理事会的表决机器并且玩弄弃权诡计，在四月十四日拒绝了亚洲和阿拉伯十三国的要求。
    日本人民追悼高桥正夫等死难烈士
    在日本国民救援会的主持下，日本人民于六月二十六日在东京浅草区本愿寺举行追悼会，公葬在“五一”节和“五·三○”爱国运动中被美、日反动派屠杀的爱国烈士高桥正夫等人。追悼会结束后，群众又举行了示威游行。他们抗议反动派的镇压暴行，反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”。他们的标语牌上写道：“美军滚回去！”
    智利劳动人民反对与美国缔结军事协定
    智利劳动人民坚决反对美国与智利缔结的军事互助协定。美国报纸报道：七月三日智利当局动员了大批用步枪、机关枪和催泪瓦斯弹武装起来的警察以防止更进一步的反美“骚动”，因为参议院在继续讨论美智军事互助协定。在圣地牙哥国会大楼附近，警察断绝一切交通，并且禁止集会。在公塞普森矿区和工业中心，工矿及纺织业工会布置了二十四小时的罢工，以示反对这个奴役性的协定。
    丹麦人民抗议李奇微到哥本哈根
    北大西洋侵略军总司令李奇微于七月三日抵达哥本哈根，受到丹麦劳动人民的愤怒抗议。三日晚间，在李奇微到达哥本哈根以后，哥本哈根居民成群结队到李奇微所居住的旅馆前示威，示威者高呼：“李奇微滚回去！”同时，哥本哈根还举行了许多抗议大会，会上发言的人一致要求：丹麦政府停止实行战争政策，李奇微将军回国去，丹麦退出北大西洋侵略集团。
