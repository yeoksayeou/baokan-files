    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. London Worker's Daily reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 18th: Since the resumption of the meeting, administrative meetings continue to be held, but there is no indication that the U.S. side wants to resolve the only issue now obstructing the armistice agreement – the repatriation of prisoners of war. The four-day recess has led to much speculation, most of it optimistic, but none of this speculation has taken into account concrete evidence of U.S. intentions outside of Panmunjom. Even if they did take it into account, they deliberately misunderstood it. In the week since last Friday, the U.S. has carried out the biggest terror air raids of the war against the people. Nearly five hundred sorties have intruded into Chinese airspace, strafing Andong and threatening to bomb the Shuifeng Dam. Collins once said that the fierce bombing would continue until the Korean and Chinese side yielded. Fatehler once said,
    "Under certain circumstances," Clark has the power to order attacks on Manchuria, and said that the United States has enough naval power in the Far East to carry out a "planned adventure." Massacres of prisoners in American prisoner-of-war camps are endless. The Allied forces even formally spread a monstrous lie, reporting to the United Nations that 100,000 prisoners would commit suicide if they were repatriated. Another seven days of "peace" talks have passed, which is not a short time, but during this time, the Americans still have the old idea in their minds, absurdly believing that "military pressure" will surely make the Korean and Chinese side yield. This idea has never proven to be correct. This recess came after the U.S. military's air raids on the Yalu River, Pyongyang, and Northeast China, so the U.S. thought that the Korean and Chinese side would yield to the U.S.'s ultimatum at Panmunjom. After a year of experience – that is to say, they absolutely cannot scare the Korean and Chinese people, this self-deceptive idea of theirs becomes more and more dangerous each time the U.S. wants to put this idea into action. The events of the past week show that they have not abandoned their proud idea of military pressure, thus they are threatening peace here, or some powerful people in the U.S. military are taking deliberate action to obstruct the armistice agreement. It needs to be pointed out again: the Korean and Chinese side has not and will never yield to military pressure, to the large-scale massacre of the people, to germ warfare, to atomic bombs, or to any other threats from the U.S. The road to peace is through mutual agreement on fair and reasonable terms; there is no other road. Every new adventure by the United States is endangering peace, and if Fatehler's "planned adventure" goes too far, it will break down the armistice negotiations and endanger the entire world.

    揭发美方阻碍停战协议的荒谬行动
    【新华社十八日讯】据伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十八日自板门店报道：复会后，继续举行行政性会议，看不到任何迹象表明美方想解决现在阻碍停战协议的唯一问题——遣返战俘问题。四天的休会引起了许多猜测，多数猜测是乐观的，但是所有这些猜测都没有把板门店以外的地方所存在的美方意图的具体证据考虑进去。即使说他们考虑进去了，他们也是故意误解的。在上星期五以来的一周中，美方对老百姓进行了战争中最大的恐怖空袭。近五百架次飞机侵入中国领空，扫射安东，扬言要轰炸水丰水闸。柯林斯曾经说，猛烈的轰炸将继续进行，直到朝中方面屈服时为止。费泰勒曾经说，
    “在某种情况下”，克拉克有权力命令对满洲进行袭击，并说美国在远东海面有足够的海军进行一种
    “有计划的冒险”。美国俘虏营中屠杀俘虏的事情层出不穷。联军竟正式撒弥天大谎，向联合国报告说，有十万俘虏将会自杀，如果把他们遣返的话。“和”谈又过了七天，这并不是一个很短的时间，但是在这期间，美国人的脑子里还是念念不忘的那一套老想法，荒谬地认为“军事压力”一定会使朝中方面屈服。这种想法从来就没有证明是正确的。这次休会是在美军空袭鸭绿江、平壤及中国东北之后，因此美方以为朝中方面就要向美方在板门店提出的最后通牒表示屈服。经过了一年的经验——就是说他们绝对吓不倒朝中人民，他们这种自欺的想法，在美方每次想把他们这种想法付诸行动时，就越来越危险了。过去一周的事件表明：他们还没有放弃他们这种得意的军事压力的想法，因此他们正使此间的和平受到威胁，不然就是美国军方有势力的人们在采取故意阻碍停战协议的行动，需要再次指出：朝中方面过去没有而且将来也一定不会向军事压力屈服，向大规模屠杀老百姓屈服、向细菌战屈服、向原子弹或美方其他任何的威胁手段屈服。通往和平的道路，是通过在公平合理条件上的互相协议，此外没有其他的任何道路。美国的每一个新的冒险都在危及和平，而且如果因费泰勒的“有计划的冒险”而弄得太过火的话，那就会使停战谈判破裂，危及整个世界。
