Warring States Era Tombs Discovered at Taoranting in Beijing

During the dredging of the reed ponds at Taoranting in the southern part of Beijing from mid-April to the end of June this year, ancient tombs and artifacts from the Warring States period were discovered, providing extremely important materials for the study of Beijing's history. Historians can now trace the history of Beijing back more than 2,300 years.

During the lake excavation project in the first work zone of Taoranting, many Warring States period tile-ringed wells were discovered at depths ranging from about one meter to two meters below the surface. These were most densely located in the west of the pavilion, with distances ranging from more than twenty meters to as close as a few meters. Inside the wells were Warring States period comb-patterned pottery, fine cord-marked pottery, and Han pottery. Han Dynasty brick wells and Liao-Jin Dynasty groove-patterned brick wells were also found in the same stratum. There were also many roof tiles and figurines (commonly known in Beijing as "nowhere to go") from the Liao-Jin Dynasty ruins, including two exquisitely crafted "feathered men" (with wings on their backs, chicken feet, and animal heads, all based on ancient Chinese mythology). In addition, many stone balls of varying sizes were unearthed (according to Wang Zhenduo, Deputy Director of the Second Department of the Social and Cultural Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, these were ancient cannonballs), as well as many Song Dynasty porcelains. During the sewer construction project in the second work zone of Taoranting, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Relics Team conducted more detailed excavation work, discovering two Warring States period tombs, seven Han tombs, and four Liao-Jin tombs. The Warring States tombs were about one meter below the Han tombs. The skeletons had been scattered, and the pottery was also broken, including red pottery (commonly known as "fishbone basins") and fine cord-marked pottery. A Warring States period coin (spade coin) was also found in one of the tombs. The Han tombs were a few inches or a foot below the Liao-Jin tombs. In each tomb, two bell-shaped pottery pots, a pottery ding (tripod cauldron), and a round-bottomed pottery bowl with a lid were placed behind the skull. Most had skeletons, and some also had Wushu coins. In one of the Han tombs, along with the pottery, a lacquered silk fabric and a bronze arrowhead were also unearthed. The ancient tombs from the Liao-Jin Dynasty were in the uppermost layer, only one meter below the surface, and were all made of brick, but most had been damaged, leaving only the bottom of the tomb. Near the tombs, in the same stratum, were a broken Song celadon dou (stemmed dish, commonly known as a "sacrificial dish"), an iron axe, a pair of iron scissors, and many broken Song porcelains. There were also three relatively complete Warring States period tile-ringed wells, each about twenty-five to twenty-eight meters apart. The most complete one had eleven sections, each section 0.75 meters high, and fine cord-marked pottery from the Warring States period was found at the bottom of the well. In addition, a Liao-Jin Dynasty kiln was discovered, with grass ash inside and the surrounding soil burnt red. The kiln was about one zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) high. The tombs excavated this time were all tombs of ancient laborers, which are different from the tombs of ancient emperors and nobles. It is of great help to us to understand the life of ancient laborers.

    北京陶然亭发现战国时代古墓
    今年四月中旬至六月底在北京城南疏浚陶然亭苇塘时，发现了战国时代的古墓和古物，它们对北京历史的研究又提供了极为重要的材料。历史家们可以把北京的历史追溯到二千三百多年以前了。
    在陶然亭第一工区挖湖工程中，在距地面约一公尺到二公尺不等的地层，发现了许多战国时代的瓦圈井，以亭西最为密集，相距远的有二十多公尺，近的仅几公尺。井内有战国时代的栉纹陶器、细绳纹陶器和汉陶器。在同一地层还发现汉代砖井，和辽金时代的沟纹砖井。还有辽金的遗址上的许多屋瓦俑（北京俗称走头无路），其中有两个造型极精美的羽人（背有翅膀、鸡足、兽头、都是依据中国古代神话而塑制的）。此外随同出土的还有许多大小不等的石球（据中央文化部社会文化事业管理局第二处王振铎副处长说，这是古代的炮弹），以及不少宋代的瓷器。在陶然亭第二工区下水道修建工程中，北京市人民政府文物组做了比较细密的发掘工作，发现了两个战国时代的古墓和七个汉墓、四个辽金墓。战国墓在汉墓底下一公尺左右，骨架已散失，陶器也残破了，其中有红陶（俗称鱼骨盆）、细绳纹陶器，在一个墓里还发现一个战国时代的钱币（布）。汉墓在辽金墓底下数寸或一尺左右，每墓在头骨后都安置有两个钟形陶壶，一个陶鼎，一个圆底有盖的陶碗。大都有骨架，有些还有五铢钱。其中有一个汉墓随同陶器出土的还有漆练一个，铜箭簇一个。辽金时代的古墓在最上层，距地面仅一公尺，都是砖砌的，但大多数都已被破坏，只留有墓底。在墓的附近同一地层上有残破的宋青瓷豆（俗称供盏）一个，铁斧一柄，铁剪一把，残破的宋瓷很多。还有三个比较完整的战国时代的瓦圈井，每个相距约二十五公尺到二十八公尺，最完整的一个有十一节，每节高零点七五公尺，井底有战国时代细绳纹陶器。此外还发现辽金时代的窑一个，里面尚有草灰，四周的土都已被烧成红色，窑高约一丈。这次发掘出来的都是古代劳动人民的墓，和古代帝王和贵族的墓不同，它对我们了解古代劳动人民的生活有很大的帮助。
