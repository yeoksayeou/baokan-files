Young Female Communist Party Member Wang Xinli Completes Telephone Task During Enemy Air Raid

To the Editor: Wang Xinli, a young female Communist Party member and head of the telephone exchange team at the Andong City Telecommunications Bureau, bravely and calmly remained at her post when American aggressor planes invaded Andong for bombing and strafing, ensuring the smooth operation of Andong City's air defense telephone lines.

On the morning of November 8, 1950, a large group of American planes indiscriminately bombed Sinuiju, North Korea, and invaded Andong City. At that time, Wang Xinli and more than a dozen young female telephone operators in her team were working at the switchboard. Bombs fell near the Telecommunications Bureau building, the machines on the tables were shaken out of place, and glass and lime from the walls fell down. The operators' ears were ringing from the explosions. However, Wang Xinli did not panic. She thought of the lives and safety of the people of the motherland, and she knew: "The work requires me to stay here. I am a Communist Party member and should unite the masses and stick to my post!"

She turned around, and a dozen pairs of eyes were looking at her. She calmly said, "Comrades, stay calm! We must ensure that the telephone lines are open." She walked to An Yingzi's side, preparing to take over An Yingzi's shift. An Yingzi said excitedly, "Team leader, you take care of others. I will definitely be able to complete the task." Bombs continued to explode, and under Wang Xinli's influence, the female operators continued to work calmly.

The closed windows of the building were suddenly shaken down, and the screens in the room collapsed. The director of the Telecommunications Bureau's trade union called twice, urging, "Leave a few people to watch the switchboard, and the rest quickly go to the basement!" However, none of the female operators were willing to leave their posts. Wang Xinli finally decided that she and three other operators would persevere with the work, and the rest would go to the basement. Only then did everyone leave reluctantly. Wang Xinli and the other three calmly sat in front of the shaking machines, accurately connecting calls.

Wang Xinli said, "I am a Communist Party member, an outstanding daughter of the Chinese people. Countless lives and property hang on every line. Ensuring that the telephone lines are open is a sacred task given to us by the motherland."

Wang Xinli is twenty-three years old this year. She started working in 1948 and joined the Party in October 1949. Under the Party's cultivation and education, she has made many achievements in production and was selected as a Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Labor Model and a Liaodong Province Industrial Labor Model. Now, in order to further cultivate her, the Party has sent her to study at the Liaodong Provincial Party School.

    青年女共产党员王心力在敌机轰炸中完成通话任务
    编辑同志：安东市电信局话务班长王心力是个年青的女共产党员。在美国侵略军飞机侵入安东进行轰炸、扫射时，她沉着、勇敢地坚守工作岗位，保证了安东市防空电话的畅通。
    一九五○年十一月八日早晨，一大群美国飞机滥炸朝鲜新义州，并侵入安东市。这时，王心力和班里的十几名青年女话务员正在交换台工作。炸弹落在电信局大楼的附近，桌子上的机器被震得离开了原来的位置，玻璃和墙上的石灰都落下来了。话务员们的耳朵被震得嗡嗡直响。但是，王心力没有惊慌。她想到祖国人民的生命和安全，她知道：“工作需要自己留在这里。自己是共产党员，应该团结群众，坚守工作岗位！”
    她回过头来，十几双眼睛看着她。她镇静地说：“同志们，大家镇静！我们要保证电话畅通。”她走到安英子身旁，准备替安英子值班。安英子激动地说：“班长，你照顾别人去吧。我一定能完成任务。”炸弹不断地爆炸，女话务员们在王心力的影响下，照旧镇静地工作着。
    关闭着的楼窗突然被震下来了，室内的屏风被震倒了。电信局工会主任来了两次电话，催促“留几个人看台子，其余的人快进地下室！”但是，女话务员们谁也不肯离开工作岗位。王心力最后决定由她自己和另外三个话务员坚持工作，其余的人都到地下室去。大家才无可奈何地走了。王心力等四个人镇静地坐在震动着的机器前，准确地接着电话。
    王心力说：“我是共产党员，是中国人民的优秀儿女，每一条线上都挂着无数人的生命财产。保证电话畅通，就是祖国给我们的神圣任务。”
    王心力今年二十三岁，一九四八年参加工作，一九四九年十月入党。在党的培养教育下，她在生产中创造了很多成绩，被选为东北邮电劳动模范和辽东省工业劳动模范。现在，党为了进一步培养她，已把她送到辽东省党校学习。
