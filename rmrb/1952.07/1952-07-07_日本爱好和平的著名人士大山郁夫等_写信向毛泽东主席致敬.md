Xinhua News Agency, June 6th:

Prominent Japanese peace advocates Ikuo Oyama, Jiichiro Matsumoto, Koichi Uda, Ichiko Kamichika, Nyoi Sakurazawa, and Masaharu Hatanaka wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 15th anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident to pay their respects. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. Mao Zedong:

On the 15th anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, we, representing the peace-loving people of Japan, are honored to write this letter to you to pay our respects.

As you know, the six of us should have been visiting Beijing and meeting with you as representatives of Japan attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing at the beginning of June with excitement; however, the Japanese government has trampled on the will of the people and has so far refused to issue us passports. Therefore, we are writing this letter to you and would like to extend our greetings to the entire Chinese people through you to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident.

It can be said that the politics of post-war Japan has not yet taken the first step towards democratization. This situation is clearly manifested in the following two aspects: on the one hand, it has excluded your country, the biggest victim of Japanese militarism, and signed the so-called separate peace treaty; on the other hand, it has trampled on the will of the vast majority of people and forcibly formulated the so-called Anti-Subversive Activities Bill. In particular, a country that has continuously carried out eight years of war of aggression is now refusing to establish diplomatic relations with your country, which is advancing on the road of great peaceful construction, but has signed a so-called "Peace Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan" with the exiled regime in Taiwan. The broad strata of our people have expressed firm opposition and furious anger at this measure by the Japanese government. This series of policies containing malice towards your country has increased the burden of rearmament on the Japanese people. The Japanese people are increasingly struggling under heavy taxes, and at the same time, they feel the threat of war against your country and the Soviet Union approaching. Just at this time, thanks to the advocacy of peace activists in your country, the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has been carried out, and more recently, an effective and appropriate agreement on Sino-Japanese trade has been concluded. The majority of Japanese people unanimously raised voices of gratitude. Despite the Japanese government's instructions to block the news, the Japanese people are now extremely concerned about the news of your country's new construction, and throughout the country, such voices are echoing: "Without peace with China, there will be no stability in Japan!" The Japanese people are also giving enthusiastic support to the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Because the political unity of our country's democratic and peaceful forces is not strong enough, we have failed to prevent the Japanese government from implementing a series of policies hostile to your country. We, who bear the responsibility for the war of aggression, cannot express our apologies in any words; however, we harbor bright hope and confidence in the rapidly strengthening friendship between China and Japan among the Japanese people, and especially in the people's increasingly strong desire for peace.

This awakening of the Japanese people is primarily due to your country's warm policies and a series of measures to repay malice with kindness. This is the most important point that we must report to you and the people of your country. Your country responded to the treaty signed between the Japanese government and Taiwan with the Beijing trade agreement. We believe that this peaceful attitude is truly the greatest force in arousing the Japanese people's self-awareness. In the future, we are determined to continue our tenacious struggle against the remaining forces of Japanese militarism and strive for lasting peace between China and Japan. At the same time, we earnestly hope that your government and the people of your country will continue to use consistent peaceful and friendly policies to continue to inspire the Japanese people. On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, although this letter is very simple, we hope to use it as our joint salute to the people of your country.

    日本爱好和平的著名人士大山郁夫等
    写信向毛泽东主席致敬
    【新华社六日讯】日本爱好和平的著名人士大山郁夫、松本治一郎、宇田耕一、神近市子、樱泽如一和畑中政春六人，在芦沟桥事变十五周年前夕，写信向毛主席致敬。该信全文如下：亲爱的毛泽东先生：
    我们在芦沟桥事变十五周年前夕，代表爱好和平的日本人民，向您驰书致敬，引以为光荣。
    如您所悉，我们六人，本应抱着兴奋的心情作为出席六月初在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的日本代表，访问北京与您相会；但是，日本政府却蹂躏人民的意志，迄今仍拒绝发给我们护照。因此，我们写这封信给您，并愿通过您，向全中国人民致意，以纪念芦沟桥事变十五周年。
    战后日本的政治，可以说是还没有开始走向民主化的第一步。这种状况明显地表现在下列两方面：一方面，将日本军国主义最大受害者的贵国排除在外，签订了所谓单独和约；另一方面是蹂躏绝大多数人民的意志，强行制定所谓防止破坏活动法案。特别是过去连续进行了八年侵略战争的国家，今天竟拒绝和正向伟大的和平建设道路迈进的贵国建立邦交，却和台湾的流亡政权签订了所谓“中华民国和日本国和平条约”。对于日本政府的这种措施，我国人民的广大阶层表示了坚决的反对和激昂的愤怒。这一系列对贵国含有恶意的政策，加重了日本人民对重新武装的负担，日本人民日益在重税之下喘息，同时并感到重新以贵国和苏联为敌的战争威胁临近身边。刚好在这个时候，由于贵国和平活动家的倡导，筹备了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，更在最近，缔结了关于中日贸易的有效而适当的协定。日本多数人民不约而同地扬起了感谢的呼声。尽管日本政府指示封锁消息，但是日本人民现在还是对贵国的新建设的消息表示极度的关心，现在全国各地到处响彻着这样的声浪：“没有和中国之间的和平，就没有日本的安定！”日本人民对于召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，也正在给予着热烈的支持。由于我国民主主义和平势力在政治上的团结还不够，因此未能阻止日本政府一系列的敌视贵国的政策的施行，肩负侵略战争责任的我们，无论用任何言词，都不能说尽我们的歉意；但是，我们对在日本人民之间急遽加强着的中日友好的感情，特别是人民对和平之日益强烈的要求，怀抱着光明的希望和信心。
    日本人民的这种觉醒，首先是由于贵国方面的温暖政策以及一系列的以德报怨的措施所促成，这是我们不能不向您和贵国人民报告的最重要的一点。对于日本政府和台湾之间所签订的条约，贵国则以北京贸易协议来回答。我们以为这种和平的态度，真正是激起日本人民自觉的最大的力量。今后我们誓必继续和日本军国主义的残余势力进行顽强的斗争，为中日两国间的持久和平而努力，同时，也恳切地希望贵国政府和贵国人民今后仍用一贯的和平友好政策，继续鼓舞日本人民。值兹芦沟桥事变十五周年，此信虽很简单，但愿以此做为我们对贵国人民的共同致意。
