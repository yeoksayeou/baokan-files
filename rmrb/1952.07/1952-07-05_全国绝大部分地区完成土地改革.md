    Land Reform Completed in the Vast Majority of Areas Across the Country
    June 30th of this year marked the second anniversary of the Central People's Government's promulgation of the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China." Over the past two years, the vast late-liberated areas across the country have successively launched a vigorous land reform movement, achieving tremendous success. As of now, the vast majority of regions across the country have completed land reform. The Northeast Administrative Region and the agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, having been liberated earlier, completed land reform before the promulgation of the "Land Reform Law." In the North China Region, except for the areas with 200,000 agricultural people in the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League of Suiyuan Province, land reform has also been fully completed. The Northwest Region has completed land reform in areas accounting for 85% of the region's agricultural population. The Central South Region has completed land reform in areas accounting for approximately 81% of the region's agricultural population. The Southwest Region has completed land reform in areas accounting for approximately 81% of the region's total population. The East China Region has completed land reform in areas accounting for more than 90% of the region's agricultural population. In all these areas where land reform has been completed, the feudal land system has been thoroughly overthrown, thereby liberating the productive forces of the vast peasantry and creating fundamental conditions for our country's industrialization. After the land reform movement, the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast peasantry have been unprecedentedly enhanced. They are launching a large-scale patriotic production increase campaign, laboring for their own happiness and the construction of the country. The entire rural landscape has been completely renewed. Those areas where land reform has not yet been carried out or completed are mainly ethnic minority areas, pastoral areas, as well as 62 counties in all agricultural areas of Xinjiang Province and a small part of Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces. Except for the pastoral areas, these areas will implement land reform step by step under the principle of prudence and steadiness. The achievements and conditions of land reform in various regions are as follows:
    North China Region: The vast majority of areas in the region completed land reform before the promulgation of the "Land Reform Law." Suiyuan Province was the last area in the region to implement land reform. The province's land reform movement, which began last winter, was basically completed before the spring plowing. In this land reform movement, more than 1.3 million landless and land-poor peasants and other working people in the province obtained more than 11,328,000 mu of land, more than 65,000 head of draft animals, more than 61,860,000 jin of grain, and more than 277,000 pieces of agricultural implements. To date, out of the province's 2.6 million agricultural population, 2.4 million people's areas have completed land reform. The remaining areas with 200,000 agricultural people that have not yet completed land reform are mainly in the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League. Land reform in these areas will be fully completed in July and August of this year.
    Northwest Region: Except for Xinjiang Province, as of the end of May this year, land reform in the agricultural areas of the four provinces and one city of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xi'an has been basically completed. The agricultural population in these areas where land reform has been completed totals more than 24.6 million, accounting for about 85% of the Northwest Region's total agricultural population of more than 29 million. Among them, the areas that completed land reform from last winter to this spring included 114 counties and cities with an agricultural population of more than 15 million; a total of 7.5 million landless and land-poor peasants obtained more than 16 million mu of land; including other distributed property, 11 million peasants benefited from land reform. The agricultural areas that completed land reform from the winter before last to last spring had a total population of more than 8 million. As for the more than 1.6 million people in the old liberated areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia and the 200,000 people in the semi-old area of Shaanxi Province, land reform was completed before the promulgation of the "Land Reform Law." The areas that have not yet completed land reform include 62 counties in all agricultural areas of Xinjiang Province with a population of about 4 million, 200,000 people in the agricultural areas of the four counties of Minyuan, Guide, Hualong, and Xunhua in Qinghai, and 210,000 people in the Dingxi and Pingliang areas of Gansu, totaling more than 4.6 million people. Land reform in these areas will be completed step by step in the future under the principle of prudence and steadiness.
    East China Region: Currently, only 30 townships on individual islands along the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang and 34 townships (villages) along the Huai River in northern Anhui have not yet implemented land reform. All provinces and regions such as Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Southern Anhui, the vast majority of Fujian and Northern Anhui, including the suburbs of 28 cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Xuzhou, Qingdao, and Fuzhou have all completed land reform, and land certificates have been issued in most areas. These areas have more than 40,000 townships (villages), accounting for 93% of the total number of townships in the region. The land reform ending work and the issuance of land certificates are still in progress in 2,753 townships (villages) in Fujian Province and 325 townships (villages) in the Northern Anhui Region, which are expected to basically end land reform work throughout the region in June and July. Before the spring plowing last year, more than 80% of the townships (villages) in East China had completed land reform. In the past year, the areas where land reform was implemented in East China included the coastal fishing areas, salt areas, and some mountainous areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, as well as the past disaster areas of Northern Anhui, Shandong, and Northern Jiangsu. Starting last summer, these areas successively conducted multiple rounds of typical investigation and research, and then conducted experiments to create experience; the People's Governments of various provinces and regions also successively promulgated policies and methods for land reform in different areas such as mountain forests, fishing areas, and salt areas. Therefore, although the situation in these areas is more complicated and the past work foundation was weak, due to the tight grasp of the leading organs of various provinces and regions, and the relatively prepared cadres and masses, the movement has progressed smoothly, and the implementation of policies and the mobilization of the masses have also been relatively normal. By the end of May this year, land reform in these areas has also been basically completed. To date, areas with a population of over 100 million in the East China region have completed land reform. In this great land reform movement, the region confiscated and requisitioned a total of 110 million mu of cultivated land and distributed it to more than 60 million landless and land-poor peasants.
    Central South Region: The land reform movement in the Central South Region began to be launched in Henan Province, which was liberated earlier, in the winter of 1949, and the comprehensive development occurred after the Central People's Government promulgated the "Land Reform Law." As of now, among the 513 counties under the jurisdiction of the six provinces in the region and the areas with an agricultural population of more than 146.6 million in the suburbs of Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other cities, areas with an agricultural population of more than 118.75 million have completed land reform. Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have basically completed land reform; Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have completed land reform in more than one-third and two-thirds of their respective provinces. Landless and land-poor peasants in the region have obtained more than 130 million mu of land from landlords. At present, except for Guangdong and Guangxi, which are intensifying land reform and review work in areas with more than 10 million people during the agricultural busy season (the cropping seasons of the two provinces are different), the areas in the Central South Region that have completed land reform account for 81% of the total agricultural population of the region in terms of population, while the areas that have completed review work only account for a little over 40% of the areas where land reform has been carried out. It is expected that the entire region's land reform and review work can be completed before the spring plowing next year.
    Southwest Region: Since the Central People's Government promulgated the "Land Reform Law" two years ago, the areas where land reform has been implemented include the Sichuan region and 260 counties in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, as well as 12,477 townships in the suburbs of ten cities, with a population of about 73.59 million, accounting for about 81% of the total population of the Southwest region. To date, except for ethnic minority areas and some areas in Yunnan and Guizhou, the Southwest region has basically completed land reform work. In these areas that have already completed land reform, about 80% of the land has been transferred from the hands of the landlord class to the ownership of poor peasants, farm laborers, and some middle peasants with less land. As for some areas in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces that have not yet completed reform, preparations are being made to carry them out this winter and next spring.
    The rural landscape is rapidly changing in areas that have undergone land reform. The production enthusiasm of the vast peasantry has been greatly enhanced after obtaining land and other means of production and means of livelihood. The general situation is: this year's spring plowing started early, more fertilizer was applied, and the momentum of digging canals and wells to prevent drought and combat drought is great; peasants have added new agricultural implements, adopted improved varieties, and improved farming techniques. Peasants in areas threatened by drought and insect pests have universally launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic anti-drought and insect-catching campaign. Farmers in the seven counties of Jining East District in Suiyuan newly built more than 1,000 canals after completing land reform, and also dug many wells, increasing the irrigated area by more than 400,000 mu. During this year's spring drought in the Southwest region, 12 million peasants organized themselves and overcame the threat of drought in a short period of time. Peasants in various places have actively participated in labor mutual aid groups and enthusiastically participated in the patriotic production increase movement. There are already more than 1 million mutual aid groups in the entire Central South Region, including more than 5 million peasant households. Jiangxi Province in the region has 15,000 mutual aid groups and more than 84,000 individual farmers participating in the rice high-yield competition of 1,000 jin per mu, and Hunan Province also has more than 200,000 peasant households participating in the rice 1,000 jin high-yield competition. The agricultural labor mutual aid groups in the entire Southwest Region have now developed to 500,000. The agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in the newly completed land reform areas in the Northwest has also developed greatly, among which 80% of the rural labor force in Dingxi and Tianshui areas in Gansu and Minhe and Ledu counties in Qinghai has been organized. After land reform, the patriotic production increase competition movement in the rural areas of the Northwest Region is also booming. Many peasants put forward the slogan: "Work hard to produce, repay Chairman Mao!"
    The implementation of the land reform movement has greatly enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasant masses, thereby consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside. After the land reform movement, the peasant association organizations in various places have greatly developed. The members of the peasant association in Suiyuan Province in the North China Region have increased from more than 700,000 before land reform to more than 1,049,000 now. The members of the peasant association in the entire Northwest Region have developed to account for 30% to 40% of the total population. The Central South Region's peasant association has more than 40 million members. The Southwest Region's peasant association has 33.3 million members. In the vast rural areas of the aforementioned areas where land reform has been completed, the advanced organization of the New Democratic Youth League of China and the Democratic Women's Federation have also greatly developed. At the same time, a large number of activists have emerged and have been selected into the people's governments at all levels in the countryside to directly participate in the work of the state power.

    全国绝大部分地区完成土地改革
    今年六月三十日是中央人民政府公布“中华人民共和国土地改革法”的两周年。两年来，全国各地广大晚解放区先后开展了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，并且获得了巨大的成绩。截至目前为止，全国各地绝大部分地区已经完成土地改革。东北大行政区和内蒙古自治区的农业地区都因解放较早，在“土地改革法”公布之前就已完成土地改革。华北区除绥远省伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟的二十万农业人口地区外，也已全部完成土地改革。西北区已在占全区农业人口百分之八十五的地区完成土地改革。中南区已在约占全区农业人口百分之八十一的地区完成土地改革。西南区已在约占全区总人口百分之八十一的地区完成土地改革。华东区已在约占全区农业人口百分之九十以上的地区完成土地改革。所有这些已经完成土地改革的地区，都已经彻底推翻封建的土地制度，因而解放了广大农民的生产力，为我们国家的工业化创造了根本条件。经过土地改革运动以后，广大农民的政治觉悟、生产热情空前提高，他们正在开展大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动，为自己的幸福和国家的建设而劳动着。整个农村面貌已经焕然一新。那些还没有进行和完成土地改革的地区主要是少数民族地区、畜牧地区，以及新疆省全部农业区的六十二个县和青海、甘肃、云南、贵州、广东、广西等省的一小部分地区。这些地区除畜牧地区外，将在慎重稳进方针下，有步骤地实行土地改革。各区土地改革的成绩和情况如下：
    华北区：全区绝大部分地区在“土地改革法”公布以前就已完成土地改革，绥远省是全区最后实行土地改革的地区。该省去年冬季开始的土地改革运动在春耕以前即已基本完成。在这次土地改革运动中，全省有一百三十多万无地少地的农民及其他劳动人民，获得了一千一百三十二万八千多亩土地，六万五千多头耕畜，六千一百八十六万余斤粮食和二十七万七千多件农具。至此，全省二百六十万农业人口中，已有二百四十万人口地区完成土地改革。其余尚未完成土地改革的二十万农业人口的地区主要在伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟。这些地区的土地改革在今年七、八月间即可全部完成。
    西北区：除新疆省外，截至本年五月底，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、西安等四省一市农业地区的土地改革已基本完成。这些已完成土地改革的地区的农业人口，共达二千四百六十多万，约占西北区全农业人口二千九百多万人的百分之八十五。其中去年冬天到今年春天完成土地改革的地区包括一百一十四个县、市，农业人口一千五百多万；计有七百五十万无地少地的农民获得土地一千六百多万亩；如连分得的其他财物者在内，便有一千一百万农民从土地改革中得到利益。前年冬天到去年春天完成土地改革的农业地区，共有八百多万人口。至于陕甘宁老解放区的一百六十多万人口以及陕西省的半老区二十万人口，早在“土地改革法”颁布以前即已完成土地改革。现在尚未完成土地改革的地区包括新疆省全部农业区的六十二个县约四百万人口，青海亹源、贵德、化隆、循化四县农业区的二十万人，甘肃定西区、平凉区的二十一万人，共计四百六十多万人。这些地区的土地改革，今后在慎重稳进方针下有步骤地加以完成。
    华东区：现全区只有福建、浙江沿海的个别岛屿共三十个乡和皖北淮河沿岸三十四个乡（村）尚未实行土地改革。山东、苏南、苏北、浙江、皖南等省区全部，福建和皖北的绝大部分地区，包括上海、南京、杭州、济南、徐州、青岛、福州等二十八个城市的郊区已经全部完成土地改革，而且大部已颁发了土地证。这些地区共有四万多个乡（村），达全区总乡数的百分之九十三。现在正在进行土地改革结束工作和颁发土地证的尚有福建省的二千七百五十三个乡（村）和皖北区的三百二十五个乡（村），预计在六、七两月份即可在全区范围内基本结束土地改革工作。在去年春耕以前，华东地区就已经有百分之八十以上的乡（村）完成了土地改革。过去一年，华东实行土地改革的地区包括浙江和福建的沿海渔区、盐区和部分山区，皖北、山东和苏北过去的水灾区。这些地区在去年夏季开始，就陆续分别进行了多次的典型调查研究工作，然后进行实验，创造经验；各省、区人民政府又先后颁发了关于山林、渔区、盐区等不同地区进行土地改革的政策和办法。因此，虽然这些地区情况比较复杂，过去工作基础薄弱，但由于各省、区领导机关抓得较紧，干部和群众都比较有准备，因而运动进展顺利，政策的贯彻和群众的发动也较正常，到今年五月底止，这些地区的土地改革也基本上完成了。至此，华东全区已有一亿以上人口的地区完成了土地改革。在这个伟大的土地改革运动中。全区共没收和征收耕地一亿一千万亩，分给了六千万以上的无地少地的农民。
    中南区：中南区的土地改革运动，在一九四九年冬季起，就在解放较早的河南省开始发动，而全面的展开则是在中央人民政府公布“土地改革法”以后。截至目前为止，全区六省所辖的五百一十三个县和武汉、广州及其他城市郊区的一亿四千六百多万农业人口地区中，已有一亿一千八百七十五万农业人口地区完成了土地改革。河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省已基本上全部完成了土地改革；广东、广西两省已分别在本省三分之一和三分之二以上地区完成了土地改革。全区无地少地的农民已从地主手中获得了一亿三千多万亩土地。目前除广东、广西正乘农忙间隙（这两省农作季节不同），在一千多万人口地区加紧进行土地改革和复查工作外，中南全区已完成土地改革的地区，以人口计算，占全区农业总人口的百分之八十一，已完成复查工作的地区，则还只占已经进行过土地改革的地区的百分之四十强。预计在明年春耕以前，即可全部完成全区的土地改革和复查工作。
    西南区：自中央人民政府公布“土地改革法”两年以来，已实行土地改革的地区包括四川地区和云南、贵州、西康等省二百六十个县以及十个市的郊区一万二千四百七十七个乡，人口共达七千三百五十九万左右，约占西南全区总人口百分之八十一。至此，除少数民族区域和云南、贵州一部分地区外，西南区已基本上完成了土地改革工作。这些业已完成土地改革的地区，计有百分之八十左右的土地已从地主阶级手中，转为贫农、雇农以及一部分土地较少的中农所有。至于现在尚未完成改革的云南、贵州两省的一部分地区，准备在今冬明春进行。
    经过土地改革的地区，农村面貌正在迅速改变。广大农民在获得土地及其他生产资料和生活资料后，生产积极性大为提高。普遍的情况是：今年的春耕动手早、施肥多，掏渠打井防旱抗旱的劲头大；农民纷纷添置新式农具，采用优良品种并改进耕作技术。受到旱灾、虫灾威胁的地区的农民，普遍展开了空前热烈的抗旱捕虫运动，绥远集宁东区的七个县的农民在完成土地改革后新修了一千多道水渠，另外又打很多水井，增加灌溉面积四十多万亩。西南区在今年春旱期中，就有一千二百万农民组织起来，在短期内战胜了旱灾的威胁。各地农民纷纷参加劳动互助组，并热烈地参加爱国增产运动。中南全区已有包括五百多万户农民参加的一百多万个互助组。该区江西省已有一万五千个互助组和八万四千多个个体农民参加了每亩千斤的水稻丰产竞赛，湖南省也已有二十多万户农民参加水稻千斤丰产竞赛。西南全区的农业劳动互助组现在已经发展到五十万个。西北新完成土地改革地区的农业生产互助合作运动也有了很大发展，其中甘肃定西、天水等专区以及青海的民和、乐都等县农村劳动力的百分之八十已经组织起来。土地改革后，西北区农村中的爱国增产竞赛运动也在蓬勃发展。许多农民提出口号：“努力生产，报答毛主席！”
    土地改革运动的进行，极大地提高了农民群众的革命积极性，因而巩固了农村中的人民民主专政。经过土地改革运动之后，各地农民协会组织已有了很大的发展。华北区绥远省的农民协会会员，已从土地改革前的七十多万发展到现在的一百零四万九千多人。西北全区的农民协会会员已经发展到占总人口的百分之三十到百分之四十。中南全区农民协会的会员已有四千多万人。西南全区农民协会的会员已达三千三百三十万。在上述各地已完成土地改革的地区的广大农村中，新中国青年的先进组织中国新民主主义青年团和民主妇女联合会的组织也有了很大的发展。同时并有大批积极分子涌现出来，被选拔到农村中各级人民政府内，直接参加国家政权工作。  （新华社）
