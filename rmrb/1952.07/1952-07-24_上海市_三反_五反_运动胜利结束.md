    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held a joint enlarged meeting from July 19th to 21st, announcing the victorious conclusion of Shanghai's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements; and determined the central tasks of Shanghai at present.
    At the meeting, Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, made a summary report on Shanghai's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. He emphasized that the great victory of Shanghai's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements was the result of the joint efforts of the working class and people from all walks of life in Shanghai under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said: In the early stage of the "Five-Anti" movement, Shanghai's industry and commerce experienced a temporary stagnation, but because the Shanghai Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee correctly grasped the policy of combining "Five-Anti" with production, the national financial and economic departments vigorously carried out processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending work, and the working class's enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, most manufacturers solved their difficulties, and the market gradually became active. According to statistics at the end of June, the sales volume of several major products of private factories increased compared with the same period last year. The trading volume of market commodities is also gradually increasing. In particular, after the East China Military and Political Committee's Trade Department, together with the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, convened the East China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference, with a transaction volume of 1.7 trillion yuan, the market became even more active. This shows that after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, all legitimate industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have been rapidly restored and further developed on a new basis. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have created extremely favorable conditions for the country's economic construction and the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. Deputy Mayor Pan then analyzed and explained issues such as public-private relations and labor-capital relations based on the instructions of Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council, at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Finally, Deputy Mayor Pan put forward the five major central tasks of Shanghai at present: requiring people from all walks of life to fully utilize all the new favorable conditions after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, continue to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy on the basis of victory, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers; carry out democratic reform work in private factories and production reform work in state-owned factories; strengthen tax collection work and complete tax revenue tasks; launch ideological remolding study movement; promote the democratic construction of Shanghai, and make all preparations for the upcoming great economic construction.
    The meeting held group discussions for two days. The committee members and representatives present unanimously agreed with and supported Deputy Mayor Pan's summary report, and they all praised the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements based on their personal experiences. Many people from the industrial and commercial circles expressed that they would study the Common Program well in the future and eliminate the "five poisons." The meeting finally announced the victorious conclusion of Shanghai's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and decided to take the five major tasks put forward in Deputy Mayor Pan's summary report as the central tasks of Shanghai at present.

    上海市“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海市人民政府委员会暨上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会于七月十九日至二十一日举行联席扩大会议，宣布上海市“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束；并确定了上海市当前的中心任务。
    会上，上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年作了上海市“三反”“五反”运动的总结报告。他着重说明：上海市“三反”“五反”运动的伟大胜利，是上海工人阶级及各界人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下共同努力的结果。他说：在“五反”运动的初期，上海市工商业曾经出现了暂时的呆滞现象，但是由于上海市增产节约委员会正确掌握了“五反”结合生产的方针，国家财经部门大力开展了加工、订货、收购、贷款的工作，以及工人阶级生产积极性的空前提高，大部厂商解决了困难，市场渐趋活跃。根据六月底的统计，私营工厂几种主要产品的销数，比去年同期都有增加。市场商品的交易量也在逐步增加中。特别是华东军政委员会贸易部会同上海市人民政府工商局召开华东区城乡物资交流大会，成交了一万七千亿元之后，市场更形活跃。这说明经过“三反”“五反”之后，一切正当的有利于国计民生的工商业，已在新的基础上获得了迅速的恢复和进一步的发展。“三反”“五反”运动为国家经济建设和正当的私营工商业的发展创造了极其有利的条件。潘副市长接着根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会主任陈云在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的指示，就公私关系、劳资关系等问题作了分析和说明。潘副市长最后提出了上海市当前的五大中心工作：要求各界人民充分运用“三反”“五反”后一切新的有利条件，在胜利基础上继续开展增产节约运动，以支持中国人民志愿军；进行私营工厂的民主改革工作和国营工厂的生产改革工作；加强税收工作，完成税收任务；展开思想改造学习运动；推进上海市的民主建政工作，为即将到来的伟大经济建设作好一切准备。
    会议进行了两天小组讨论。到会的委员和代表一致同意和拥护潘副市长的总结报告，他们都以亲身体验赞扬“三反”“五反”运动的伟大胜利。许多工商界人士表示今后要好好学习共同纲领，肃清 “五毒”。会议最后宣布上海市“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束，并决定以潘副市长总结报告中提出的五大工作作为上海市当前的中心任务。
