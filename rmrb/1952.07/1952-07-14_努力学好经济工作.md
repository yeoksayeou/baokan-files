    Strive to Learn Economic Work Well
    Li Xiannian, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Editor's Note: This article was written by Comrade Li Xiannian for the 31st anniversary of the Party and was published in the "New Wuhan" newspaper on July 1st. It is now slightly revised and excerpted here.

    Communist Party members should strive to learn how to do economic work well. This issue is not a new one for our Party. Many years ago, our Party leader Chairman Mao called on us to "pay attention to economic work." With the victory of the revolution, according to the objective conditions for developing the economy, specific requirements for learning economic work were put forward from time to time, policies and guidelines for developing China's economy were formulated, and methods of economic work were proposed. The theory of economic work occupies an extremely important position in the treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought.

    In the past three years, many of our comrades have followed the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, and learned a lot of economic knowledge and skills, making themselves or about to become "experts" in economic work; but some comrades have not done so, or have not done well enough, so that they are in a "layman's" position in the face of new things, allowing others to manipulate them. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, some comrades saw that our Party resolutely opposed the "three evils" and eliminated the "five poisons," and mistakenly thought that we did not attach importance to economic work. They saw or were subjected to criticism from the masses about some ideas and behaviors that were not conducive to economic construction, and some work styles that were lazy to learn economic work, and a retreat thought arose, and an erroneous negative thought of not wanting to do economic work or being afraid of doing economic work. They thought that "doing economic work will inevitably lead to corruption"; believing that "dealing with the bourgeoisie will sooner or later be dragged into the water"; saying "doing any work is revolution, why bother with economic work and hurt this brain," and so on. The emergence of these erroneous ideas is, of course, due to personal plans, personal gains and losses, and short-sightedness; but in-depth study reveals that it is mainly due to an unclear understanding of the fundamental task of the revolution, insufficient understanding of the importance of economic work, insufficient understanding of the upcoming large-scale economic construction, and also due to the empiricism in ideological methods.

    Analyzing it, there are probably two types of people who "do not want to do economic work." One type is old cadres, most of whom are Communist Party members. The reasons why they have the idea of not wanting to do economic work are roughly: 1. A lofty idea. Thinking that "economic work is easy to lose one's position," and therefore disdaining to engage in economic work. 2. The empiricism of thought and work style is at play. They are not accustomed to today's complex struggle environment, and therefore are not good at or unwilling to learn economic work, and do not have the courage and confidence to turn a few hairs white in order to learn economic work. 3. Dividing political work and economic work. Thinking that they are specialized in political work (and also familiar with some aspects), while economic work is done by some technical personnel. They have not realized that "politics is the concentrated expression of economics," and splitting political work and economic work, so they can only talk emptily about "politics" and "leadership." These comrades do not understand the truth that Stalin said: "If the proletarian party wants to become a real party, it should first of all master the laws of production development and the laws of social and economic development." (Problems of Leninism. Moscow, Chinese version. Page 725) Therefore, they gave up learning and leading economic work. 4. Seeing economic work as trivial, difficult, troublesome, and unlearnable. Of course, all of the above ideas are wrong. The victory that our Party's martyrs exchanged with their blood today needs us—first of all, Communist Party members—to consolidate and develop it. And in order to develop and consolidate this great victory, the most important way is to learn economic work and strengthen the leadership of economic work.

    The other type is new cadres. The reasons why they have this idea are roughly: 1. Short-sightedness, unable to see the prospects of our great motherland's economic construction, thinking that some of their work (such as procurement, storage, accounting, general affairs, etc.) is not economic work, but trivial affairs, with no "future" (? ) and "little personal development" (? ). 2. The wage-earning point of view is at play. Thinking that doing economic work is revolution, and you can get a salary, and doing other things is also revolution and you can also get a salary, why bother with economic work, "sooner or later you will be dragged into the water," and end up with a headache? Therefore, they are not at ease with or afraid of doing economic work. These comrades do not understand that although any work that is beneficial to the people is revolutionary work, what is more urgent for the Chinese people today is the work of developing the economy. They also do not understand that today there is a bourgeoisie, and doing financial and economic work will certainly deal with them, and doing other revolutionary work will also have direct and indirect contact with them. The problem is not whether or not to have contact with the bourgeoisie, but whether you can firmly stand on the proletarian and people's position to treat people and things. As the saying goes: "If you have a clear conscience, you are not afraid of ghosts knocking on your door in the middle of the night," which is very true; and the saying that "those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black" is a mechanical materialist point of view. Now, aren't there tens of thousands of staff members in our various financial and economic work positions, dealing with the bourgeoisie? Because of their dedication, aren't they all able to maintain the fine style and quality of state workers?

    A common reason why the above two types of people are unwilling to do financial and economic work is that they neglect the importance of economic work in the revolutionary struggle, and do not understand or neglect that the fundamental purpose of the revolution is to liberate and improve the productive forces; and in order to liberate and improve the productive forces, we must do a good job in economic work and learn economic work well, otherwise, socialism—a beautiful future—will not come naturally.

    Therefore, we should criticize the above-mentioned incorrect ideas and strive to learn economic work well. Here, let us review some of the instructions that our leader and our mentor Chairman Mao has given us over the years!

    Chairman Mao said:

    "We should not only be able to run politics, run the military, run party affairs, run culture, but also run the economy. If we are capable in everything, but are incompetent in economics, then we are a bunch of useless people, we will be defeated by the enemy, and we will be doomed to destruction."

    He also said:

    "The people support the Communist Party because we represent the demands of the nation and the people, but if we cannot solve economic problems, if we cannot establish a new type of industry, if we cannot develop the productive forces, the people will definitely not support us."

    He also said:

    "If we Communists do not care about industry, do not care about the economy, and do not understand any other beneficial work, and are ignorant and incapable of all of these, and can only do a kind of abstract 'revolutionary work,' this kind of revolutionary is worthless. We should oppose these armchair revolutionaries and learn various technical knowledge to industrialize China."

    Comrades, these admonitions from our leader are truly alarm bells ringing for us! Furthermore, on January 10, 1945, on the eve of our victory over the Japanese invaders, Chairman Mao more specifically required us to "completely learn economic work within two or three years." Our leader made such instructions to us very early based on his great vision.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao once again reminded us:

    "Serious economic construction tasks are before us. Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. This is the difficulty. The imperialists are counting on us to fail to run the economy well. They stand aside and watch, waiting for our failure. We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn things we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Dig in, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and you can always learn it. Some people in the Soviet Communist Party also did not know how to run the economy at the beginning, and the imperialists also waited for their failure. But the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) won."

    How beneficial it is for us to review Chairman Mao's instructions again today! As Chairman Mao said: "The important thing is to be good at learning." With our great Party and Chairman Mao leading us, and various domestic and foreign conditions so favorable to us, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, as long as we learn, we will do a good job in economic work, and we will work together with the people of the whole country to greatly advance our country's productive forces. Therefore, all Communist Party members should abandon personal plans, discard all incorrect ideas, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and strive a hundred times harder to learn economic work well. Let us use all our efforts to welcome the upcoming large-scale planned economic construction! Let us strive to fulfill the glorious and great tasks entrusted to us by the people of the whole country!

### 努力学好经济工作

    努力学好经济工作
    中国共产党武汉市委会书记  李先念
    编者按：此文是李先念同志为党的三十一周年而作，曾在七月一日的“新武汉”报上发表。现在略作修改，摘要发表在这里。
    共产党员应当努力学会作经济工作。这一问题，在我们党来说，不是今天才提出来的。多少年以前，我们党的领袖毛主席就号召我们“必须注意经济工作”。随着革命的胜利，根据发展经济的客观条件，又随时提出了学习经济工作的具体要求，制定了发展我国经济的政策和方针，提出了经济工作的方法。关于经济工作的理论，在毛泽东思想宝库中占有极为重要的位置。
    三年来，我们许多同志遵循着党和毛主席的指示，学习了许多经济工作的知识和技能，使自己成为或即将成为经济工作的“内行”；但也有些同志，没有这样做，或做得不够好，使自己在新的事物面前，不能不居于“外行”的地位，听任别人摆布。在“三反”“五反”运动之后，有些同志看到我们党用坚决的态度反对“三害”、清除“五毒”，就错误地以为我们不重视经济工作。他们看到或受到群众对一些不利于经济建设的思想和行为、一些懒于学习经济工作的作风的批评，就产生了一种退却思想，产生了不愿作经济工作或怕作经济工作的错误的消极思想。他们认为“作经济工作必然会贪污”；以为“和资产阶级打交道，迟早会被拉下水去”；说什么“做任何工作都是革命，何必作经济工作，伤此脑筋”等等。所以产生这些错误思想，固然因为有个人的打算，个人的得失，眼光短小等；但细究起来，主要是由于对革命的根本任务认识不清，对经济工作的重要性认识不足，对即将到来的大规模的经济建设认识不足，也由于思想方法上的经验主义作怪。
    分析一下，所谓“不愿作经济工作”的大约有两种人。一种是老干部，其中大部分是共产党员。他们之所以产生不愿作经济工作的思想，大体由于：一、清高思想。以为“经济工作易于失掉立场”，因而不屑于从事经济工作。二、经验主义的思想和作风作怪。他们不习惯于今天复杂的斗争环境，因而不善于或者不愿意学习经济工作，没有为了学会经济工作白几根头发的勇气和信心。三、把政治工作和经济工作割裂开来看待。以为自己是专搞政治的（在某些方面也熟悉一些），经济工作则是一些技术人员来作的。没有认识到“政治就是经济的集中表现”，把政治工作和经济工作分裂开来，这样，他们就只能空谈“政治”和“领导”了。这些同志不懂得斯大林所说的一条真理：“无产阶级党要想成为真正的党，首先就应精通生产发展底规律，社会经济发展底规律。”（列宁主义问题。莫斯科、中文版。第七二五页）因而放弃了对于经济工作的学习和领导。四、把经济工作看成琐细、繁难、麻烦和不可学得的工作。当然，上述这些思想都是错误的。我们党的先烈，以热血换来的今天的胜利，正需要我们——首先是共产党员去巩固它，发展它。而为了发展和巩固这一伟大胜利，最重要的办法是学会经济工作，加强对经济工作的领导。
    另一种人便是新干部。他们所以产生这一思想，大体上是由于：一、眼光短小，看不见我们伟大祖国经济建设的远景，以为自己的一些工作（例如采购、保管、会计、总务等等）不是什么经济工作，是些琐细的事务工作，没有“出息”（？）、“个人发展不大”（？）。二、雇佣观点作怪。以为作经济工作是革命，可以拿薪金，作别的也是革命也可以拿薪金，何必作经济工作，“迟早会被拉下水去”，落个伤脑筋呢？因而不安心于或怯于做经济工作。这些同志不懂得：固然只要对人民有利的工作都是革命工作，而今天对中国人民更为迫切的便是发展经济的工作。他们也不懂得：今天有资产阶级存在，作财经工作固然会和他们打交道，而作别的革命工作也会和他们有直接间接的来往。问题不在于和资产阶级有无来往，而在于你是否能坚定地站在无产阶级的、人民的立场上去对人处事。俗语说：“为人不作亏心事，半夜不怕鬼叫门”，这是很对的；而那种“近朱者赤，近墨者黑”的说法，则是机械唯物论的观点。现在在我们的各种财经工作岗位上不是有成千成万的工作人员，在和资产阶级打交道吗？由于他们兢兢业业，不是都能保持国家工作人员的优良作风和品质吗？
    上述两种人所以不愿作财经工作的一个共同原因，是忽视经济工作在革命斗争中的重要性，不懂得或者忽视了革命的根本目的是要解放和提高生产力；而为了解放和提高生产力，就要搞好经济工作，学好经济工作，不然，社会主义——美好的将来，是不会自然而然地到来的。
    因此，我们应当批判上述那些不正确的思想，努力学会经济工作。在这里还是让我们来温习一下我们的领袖、我们的导师毛主席历年来给我们的一些指示吧！
    毛主席说：
    “我们不但应该会办政治，会办军事，会办党务，会办文化，我们也应当会办经济，如果我们样样能干，惟独经济无能，那我们就是一批无用之人，就要被敌人打倒，就要陷于灭亡。”
    又说：
    “老百姓拥护共产党，是因为我们代表了民族与人民的要求，但是如果我们不能解决经济问题，如果我们不能建立新式工业，如果我们不能发展生产力，老百姓就一定不拥护我们。”
    又说：
    “如果我们共产党员不关心工业，不关心经济，也不懂得别的什么有益的工作，对这一些一无所知，一无所能，只会作一种抽象的‘革命工作’，这种革命家是毫无价值的，我们应该反对这些空头革命家，学习使中国工业化的各种技术知识。”
    同志们，我们领袖的这些告诫，真是对我们敲起的警钟！再看，一九四五年一月十日，即我们战胜日寇的前夕，毛主席更具体地要求我们要在“两三年内完全学会经济工作”。我们的领袖根据他的伟大远见，很早就给我们作了这样的指示。
    中华人民共和国开国以后，毛主席再一次提醒我们：
    “严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。帝国主义者算定我们办不好经济。他们站在一旁看，等待我们的失败。我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。苏联共产党人开头也有一些人不会办经济，帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败。但是联共是胜利了。”
    我们今天来重新温习毛主席的这些指示，对于我们该是多么有益呵！还是毛主席的话：“重要的问题在于善于学习。”有我们伟大的党和毛主席在领导我们，国内外的各种条件对我们这样的有利，我们又有苏联的无私的援助，只要我们学习，我们就会把经济工作办好，就会协同全国人民一齐把我国的生产力大大向前推进。因此，一切共产党员都应当抛去个人打算，丢掉一切不正确的思想，遵循毛主席的指示，百倍努力学好经济工作。让我们用一切努力来迎接即将到来的大规模的有计划的经济建设吧！让我们努力完成全国人民所赋与我们的光荣伟大的任务吧！
