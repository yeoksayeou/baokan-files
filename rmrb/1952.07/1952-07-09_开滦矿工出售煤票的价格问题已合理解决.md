    The Problem of Kailuan Miners Selling Coal Tickets at a Price Has Been Reasonably Resolved
    Comrade Editor: Comrade Zhang Jiaren's letter regarding "Kailuan miners' request to acquire coal tickets at a reasonable price" raises a valid point. We would now like to inform you of the situation regarding the acquisition of coal tickets, the handling process, and our self-criticism regarding this matter.
    In order to meet the needs of Kailuan Coal Mine employees who were eager to sell coal tickets during the Spring Festival, our Tangshan branch company, after requesting instructions from the superior company, and with the consent of relevant departments such as the mine area trade union and the Party committee, signed an agreement with the East Third Mine Employees' Cooperative, assisted by the East Mine Cooperative office, to acquire coal tickets. The agreement temporarily stipulated the price of No. 2 fine coal as 88,000 yuan, stating that after the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Fuel Industry formally signed a contract and determined the mine price, it would be handled according to the principle of "supplementing shortfalls and not refunding surpluses" (i.e., if the mine price was higher than 88,000 yuan, the company would make up for the amount the workers had received less; if it was lower than 88,000 yuan, the workers would not refund the company).
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Trade signed a coal agreement on March 29th. After our North China Region Company received the agreement notice, although it made arrangements at the business planning meeting in late April, it did not promptly urge the Tangshan branch company to resolve the issue of supplementary payments in accordance with the newly ordered mine price. It was not until May 22nd that the Tangshan branch company calculated and made up the difference between the past acquisition price of coal tickets and the mine price of 104,000 yuan to the workers, and signed a future acquisition contract based on the mine price. In this way, the issue of the vital interests of tens of thousands of workers was delayed for fifty days without being resolved. This is an intolerable mistake.
    The head office mistakenly believed that the issue of coal ticket acquisition prices should be resolved by subordinate companies, and abandoned its responsibility for supervision and inspection. This shows that we still have bureaucratic work styles in the great "Three-Anti" movement. In addition to seriously examining and correcting this mistake, we also apologize to the Kailuan Coal Mine worker comrades.

### 开滦矿工出售煤票的价格问题已合理解决

    开滦矿工出售煤票的价格问题已合理解决
    编辑同志：张家仁同志关于“开滦矿工要求按合理价格收购煤票”的来信中所提出的意见是正确的。现在我们把收购煤票问题的情况、处理经过以及我们对这件事的检讨告诉你们。
    我唐山支公司为了满足开滦煤矿职工春节时急于出售煤票的要求，经请示上级公司批准，并征得矿区工会和党委等有关部门同意，在东矿合作社办事处协助下，和东三矿职工合作社签订协议书，收购煤票。协议书中暂时规定二号末煤价格为八万八千元，说明等中央贸易部与中央燃料工业部正式签订合同、确定矿价后，再按少补多不退的原则（即如矿价高于八万八千元时，工人少得之数由公司追补；低于八万八千元时，工人不再向公司退款）处理。
    中央燃料工业部与贸易部在三月二十九日签订了煤炭协议。我华北区公司接到协议通知后，虽在四月下旬业务计划会议上做了布置，但没有及时督促唐山支公司按照新订矿价解决追补问题。直到五月二十二日，唐山支公司才把过去收购煤票的差额，按矿价十万四千元计算追补工人，并按矿价签订了今后收购合同。这样，就使关系数万工人切身利益的问题，拖延五十天不得解决。这是不能容忍的错误。
    总公司错误地认为收购煤票价格问题应由下级公司解决，放弃了督促检查的责任。这说明我们在伟大的“三反”运动中仍有官僚主义作风。我们除了认真地检讨与纠正这种错误外，并向开滦煤矿工人同志们道歉。中国煤业建筑器材公司经理    李南生
