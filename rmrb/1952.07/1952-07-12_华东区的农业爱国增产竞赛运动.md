    Agricultural Patriotic Increase Production Emulation Campaign in East China
    East China Military and Political Committee Department of Agriculture and Forestry
    The patriotic increase production emulation campaign in East China this year mainly has two forms: one is an all-round increase in production of 20% for all crops calculated uniformly; the other is creating new records for high yields of certain crops in 1952. On March 20th, the East China Military and Political Committee issued instructions on launching an agricultural patriotic increase production emulation campaign, clearly pointing out that: the launch of the emulation should be based on labor models, mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms as the backbone, absorbing the broad masses to participate, to achieve the goal of universally increasing yield per unit area; the development of the movement must be carried out according to the principles of launching at each level, responsibility at each level, meticulous organization, specific guidance, and universal development. On April 9th, 83 mutual aid teams, 12 agricultural production cooperatives, 13 state-owned farms, and 8 new record creators who jointly challenged the East China region and responded to the challenges from the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, Shuangqiao Experimental Farm, etc., published their challenge letters and increase production plans, and the regional increase production emulation gradually unfolded comprehensively. As of early June, a total of 904 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, 46 individual households, and 129 state-owned farms from various provinces (regions) and cities had jointly responded to the challenge to the entire East China region, plus individual responding teams and cooperatives, completing thousands of teams' response to the emulation plan. According to incomplete statistics, over 150,000 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, over 340 state-owned farms, and over 26,400 individual households throughout the region are involved in the chain emulation.
    After the start of the emulation, new content was continuously added to the emulation in various places: Northern Jiangsu launched the "Ten Thousand Teams, Thousand Villages" movement; Southern and Northern Anhui launched the "Thousand Teams Challenge, Ten Thousand Teams Respond" movement; some areas in Fujian proposed a "Thousand Teams, Hundred Villages Challenge Emulation"; Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places launched a rice "Thousand Jin Emulation," with 4,612 households participating in the "Thousand Jin Emulation" in the Minhou District of Fujian alone; Fenghuang and other townships in Changshu County, Southern Jiangsu, proposed the slogan "Village-by-Village Emulation, Team-by-Team Emulation, Household-by-Household Emulation, Everyone Emulates"; some areas, in conjunction with the busy farming season, flexibly organized competitions for deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, rice transplanting, pest control, water management, silkworm rearing, afforestation, etc.; some labor models proposed what to compete in each season. For example, in rice transplanting, there were various forms of competitions such as comparing speed and quality, enriching the content of the movement. At present, the emulation movement is continuing to consolidate and develop.
    Emulation Improved Peasants’ Enthusiasm for Organizing to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
    The emulation powerfully promoted the patriotic increase production movement. In areas where the emulation was correctly carried out, production work presented a new atmosphere, and the production enthusiasm and patriotic fervor of the masses of peasants were unprecedentedly high.
    1. Through the emulation movement, the superiority of organization was publicized, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for organizing was inspired, and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement was promoted. Those who were unwilling to participate in mutual aid organizations because they found it troublesome now demanded to join. People regarded participating in mutual aid teams as an honor. In Minhou County, Fujian, there were only 743 permanent mutual aid teams in mid-March, but by the end of April, this had developed to 1,811 permanent mutual aid teams, an increase of 144%. Mutual aid organizations in other areas also developed rapidly.
    2. Through the emulation movement, the conservative thinking of the peasants was initially broken. Many peasants enthusiastically learned advanced experiences and requested technical guidance. This spring, peasants in the rice-growing areas of Southern Jiangsu and other places sent over 700 representatives to visit the Chen Yongkang mutual aid team. After their on-site visit, they believed that Chen Yongkang's "methods" were indeed reasonable; the obvious facts initially overcame their thinking that "production had reached its peak." The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government issued an order to reward high-yield models, which encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses and broke the thinking of "fearing burdens" and "fearing to reveal wealth." Many high-yield experts regretted not reporting a lower yield last year. Many mutual aid teams and peasants organized agricultural technology research groups and demarcated small plots of land to learn advanced experiences and conduct experiments.
    3. The emulation movement encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses and powerfully promoted this year's spring plowing work, enabling the smooth and early completion of spring plowing and planting. This year, farmers in various places have also significantly improved their farming standards. Deep plowing and fine harrowing were universally implemented throughout the region, the number of weeding times was greatly increased compared to previous years, and the amount of fertilizer applied generally exceeded that of last year. Significant achievements have also been made in drought and flood prevention. Many mutual aid teams in Southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Nanjing, and other places put forward the guarantee that "we will not suffer from drought if it does not rain for two months." The masses' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. Even farmers who did not participate in the emulation were secretly working hard, wanting to surpass the teams and households participating in the emulation.
    In the emulation movement, various places conducted mass inspections in a guided manner. After Xin Deng County, Zhejiang, created the experience of mass inspections, this method was implemented in various places. This played a great role in promoting the completion of the emulation plan. For example, Qianyu Village in the suburbs of Fuzhou City established an inspection and evaluation committee, adopting a method that combined meeting summaries and field inspections to carry out a mass inspection. After the inspection and evaluation, the entire village applied an additional 382 dan of human manure, 379 jin of bone meal, 681 jin of fertilizer powder, and 45 dan of grass and wood ash, ensuring the realization of the village's high-yield plan.
    It is Necessary to Overcome Formalism and the Phenomenon of "Having Points Without Surface"
    In the process of launching the emulation, many cadres and the broad masses received education and recognized that launching the emulation is "one of the most important leadership methods to attract the broad masses of peasants to participate in national construction, and also the most meaningful way of life for the working people of our country." However, due to insufficient experience and relatively hasty arrangements, there are still some shortcomings in the emulation movement that must be overcome.
    1. There was a phenomenon of doing everything for the masses when formulating increase production plans at the beginning. For example, in Tongxin Village, Siyang County, Northern Jiangsu, every household had a plan, but they were all drawn up by the cadres and posted on the doors of each household, and the masses did not know what its content was. The increase production plans of 260 households in Huayuan Village, Er District, Dangtu County, Anhui, were uniformly stipulated by the village finance and grain personnel and distributed to each household. The township government of Xixiang Township, Minhou, Fujian, issued a notice calling on the masses of the whole township to "participate in the patriotic increase production emulation as a whole and must not violate it." Some plans did not pay attention to improving technology and learning high-yield experiences, but focused on increasing labor intensity, and some farmers became ill due to excessive fatigue.
    2. The plans were unrealistic. In Nanhui County, Southern Jiangsu, some mutual aid teams participating in the Southern Jiangsu response complained that the yields reported were too high, and some members requested to withdraw from the teams. For example, eight members of the Li Yunqing mutual aid team requested to withdraw. The Xing Yuzhen mutual aid team in Northern Jiangsu produced 350 jin of cotton per mu on high-yield fields last year, and this year's plan increased to 1,100 jin, but there were no specific measures to guarantee the increase in production. Some even fabricated plans out of thin air. For example, a farmer in the suburbs of Fuzhou City did not have paddy fields, but he also wrote a sentence in his plan "make suitable rice seedling fields."
    Some mutual aid teams used the method of lowering last year's yield to increase the percentage of increase in production. For example, Shao Achuan, a farmer in Songyan Township, Xin Deng County, Zhejiang, actually produced 800 jin per mu last year, but only reported 400 jin this year, and shouted to increase production by 30% in vain. There were also those who participated in the emulation by lowering their yields for fear of increasing the burden. This situation was quite common in individual areas, and has been corrected after education and inspection.
    3. Some farmers only participated in the emulation verbally, without making plans. For example, Kengping Village, San District, Sha County, Fujian, proposed to increase production by 20% and challenged Gaosha Village, but everyone did not know what to do, just shouting emulation in vain, without any practical action.
    4. The development of the emulation is uneven, and patriotic education and production direction education are not deep enough. There are more than 1.4 million mutual aid teams in the entire East China region, but only over 100,000 participated in the emulation. The emulation movement in some places is still only staying in a few key villages, mutual aid teams, or a few labor models and activists, and has not been implemented among the masses. In Gushan Village, Zichuan, Shandong, only three village cadres and four people's representatives participated in the emulation, forming a solitary army. In Haiyan County, Zhejiang, the masses requested to organize and carry out the emulation movement, but the cadres did not lead it. In some old revolutionary base areas, the cooperation and mutual aid organizations have a solid foundation, and the masses' demands for expanding production are also very urgent, but the leading cadres do not launch the emulation, so production there is not very active.
    Strengthen Leadership and Improve the Movement a Step Further
    In order to implement the emulation movement throughout the year, achieve a complete beginning and end, and ensure the successful completion of the increase production plan, we plan to take the following steps to consolidate achievements and correct shortcomings:
    1. Areas where the emulation has already been launched should strengthen leadership, universally carry out patriotic education, and make the movement continue to deepen and improve. Areas where the movement has not yet been launched or has been launched slowly should combine the current production work to mobilize the masses step by step, prevent and overcome the phenomenon of lack of leadership in the movement. All localities should summarize the situation of launching the emulation, gain leadership experience; and through inspection, revise plans in a timely manner, commend and reward the models that have emerged in the emulation, universally establish mass inspection systems and organizations, and promote the healthy development of the movement.
    2. East China has established organizations for the Agricultural Increase Production Award Committee and should award prizes in a timely manner after the wheat harvest. This work is of great significance for promoting future emulation movements.
    3. After the summer harvest, in addition to carrying out the award work, all localities should take the district as a unit, with people sent by the county to guide, universally convene representative meetings of mutual aid teams participating in the emulation, introduce models, promote positive factors, correct various shortcomings, improve the emulation a step further, and promote the improvement and consolidation of mutual aid teams.

    华东区的农业爱国增产竞赛运动
    华东军政委员会农林部
    华东区今年的爱国增产竞赛，主要有两种形式：一是各种农作物统一计算在内的全面增产二成的竞赛；一是创造一九五二年某几种作物高额产量新纪录的竞赛。三月二十日，华东军政委员会发布了关于开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动的指示，明确指出：竞赛的发动应以劳动模范、互助组、农业生产合作社和国营农场为骨干，吸收广大群众参加，达到普遍提高单位面积产量的目的；运动的开展必须根据层层发动、按级负责、细致组织、具体指导、普遍开展的原则进行。四月九日，向华东区联名挑战并向李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社、双桥实习农场等应战的八十三个互助组、十二个农业生产合作社、十三个国营农场和八个创造新纪录者发表了挑战书和增产计划，全区增产竞赛逐步全面展开。截至六月上旬为止，各省（区）市向全华东区联名应战的计九百零四个互助组和农业生产合作社，四十六个单干户，一百二十九个国营农场，加上个别应战的组、社，已经完成了千组应战竞赛计划。全区卷入连环竞赛的，据不完全统计，已有十五万多个互助组和农业生产合作社，三百四十多个国营农场，两万六千四百多个单干户。
    竞赛开展后，各地不断地充实了竞赛的新内容：苏北发起“万组千村”运动；皖南、皖北发动“千组挑战，万组应战”运动；福建部分地区提出“千组百村挑战竞赛”；苏南、浙江、福建等地发起了水稻“千斤竞赛”，福建闽侯一区参加“千斤竞赛”的就有四千六百一十二户；苏南常熟县凤凰等乡提出“村村竞赛，组组竞赛，户户竞赛，人人竞赛”的口号；有些地区，结合农忙季节，机动组织深耕、积肥、插秧、治螟、治水、养蚕、造林等竞赛；有的劳动模范提出在什么季节竞赛什么。例如，在插秧中，比插得快、插得好多种形式的竞赛，丰富了运动的内容。目前竞赛运动还在继续不断地巩固和发展中。
    竞赛提高了农民组织起来提高单位面积产量的积极性
    竞赛有力地推动了爱国增产运动。正确地开展竞赛的地区，生产工作都呈现了一种新的气象，农民群众的生产积极性和爱国热情空前高涨。
    一、各地通过竞赛运动，宣传了组织起来的优越性，启发了广大群众组织起来的热情，推动了互助合作运动的发展。以前嫌麻烦不愿意参加互助组织的，现在要求参加了。人们都以参加互助组为光荣了。福建闽侯全县在三月中旬只有七百四十三个常年互助组，到四月底已发展到一千八百十一个常年互助组，计增加了百分之一百四十四。其他地区的互助组织，也同样地在飞速发展。
    二、通过竞赛运动，初步地打破了农民的保守思想。许多农民热心学习先进经验，要求技术指导。今春苏南等水稻区的农民，派出七百多个代表，前往陈永康互助组参观。他们实地参观以后，认为陈永康的“生活”作得确实有道理；明显的事实，初步克服了他们的“生产到顶”的思想。中央农业部发表了奖励丰产模范的命令，鼓舞了群众的生产热情，打破了“怕负担”“怕露富”的思想，有不少丰产能手后悔去年不该少报产量。很多的互助组和农民组织了农业技术研究小组，并划出小块土地，学习先进经验进行试验。
    三、竞赛运动鼓舞了广大群众的生产热情，有力地推动了今年的春耕工作，使春耕春种顺利地提前完成。今年各地农民在耕作水平方面也有显著提高。全区普遍地实行了深耕细耙，锄草遍数较往年大为增加，施肥量一般超过去年。防旱防涝工作也有很大成绩。皖南、浙江、南京等地许多互助组的生产计划都提出了“两月不下雨不受旱”的保证。群众生产热情的高涨是空前的。就是没有参加竞赛的农民，也暗地里用劲，想要超过参加竞赛的组户。
    在竞赛运动中，各地有领导地开展了群众性的检查。浙江新登县创造了群众性检查的经验以后，各地都实行了这个办法。这对竞赛计划的完成，起了很大的推动作用。例如，福州市郊前屿村成立了检查评比委员会，采取会议总结和田间检查相结合的方法，开展群众性的大检查。全村在检查评比后，又增施了三百八十二担人粪、三百七十九斤骨粉、六百八十一斤肥田粉、四十五担草木灰，保证了全村丰产计划的实现。
    必须克服形式主义和“有点无面”的现象
    在发动竞赛的过程中，许多干部和广大群众受到了教育，认识了发动竞赛是“吸引广大农民参加国家建设的最重要的领导方法之一，也是我国劳动人民最有意义的生活方式”。但是，因为经验不足，而且布置得比较仓促，所以在竞赛运动中还存在着一些缺点，必须加以克服。
    一、开始制订增产计划时，有包办代替的现象。如苏北泗阳县同心村，每户都有计划，但都是由干部订好，贴在每户门上的，群众还不知道它的内容是什么。安徽当涂二区花园村二百六十户的增产计划，是由村财粮员统一规定后发到各户的。福建闽侯溪乡乡政府出布告叫全乡群众“一体参加爱国增产竞赛，不得有违”。有的计划不注意改进技术和学习丰产经验，偏重于增加劳动强度，有些农民因过于疲劳而病了。
    二、计划不切实际。苏南南汇县有些参加苏南应战的互助组，因为报的产量太高，部分组员要求退组。如李云卿互助组就有八户组员要求退组。苏北邢玉珍互助组去年丰产田每亩产棉花三百五十斤，今年计划提高到一千一百斤，但缺乏保证增产的具体措施。有的甚至无中生有，空订计划。如福州市郊有个农民并没有水田，他在计划上也写上了一条“做合式秧田”。
    有的互助组用降低去年产量的办法，提高增产成数。例如，浙江新登县松堰乡农民邵阿传的一亩田去年实产八百斤，今年只报四百斤，而空喊增产三成。也有由于怕增加负担而降低产量参加竞赛的，这种情形在个别地区曾相当普遍，经教育检查后业已纠正。
    三、有的农民只在口头上参加竞赛，而没有订出计划。如福建沙县三区坑坪村提出增产二成，向高砂村挑战，但大家还不知道怎么办，只是空喊竞赛，并无实际行动。
    四、竞赛的发展不平衡，爱国主义教育和生产方向教育尚不够深入。华东全区共有一百四十多万个互助组，参加竞赛的才只有十几万个。有些地方的竞赛运动还只停留在少数基点村、互助组或少数劳动模范和积极分子的身上，没有贯彻到群众中去。山东淄川崮山村只有三个村干部和四个人民代表参加了竞赛，形成了孤军作战。浙江海盐县群众要求组织起来开展竞赛运动，干部却不去领导。有些老区合作互助组织很有基础，群众扩大生产的要求也很迫切，但领导干部却不去发动竞赛，因此那里生产很不活跃。
    加强领导，把运动提高一步
    为了使竞赛运动贯彻全年，作到有始有终，保证增产计划圆满完成，我们拟采取下列步骤，巩固成绩，纠正缺点：
    一、竞赛已经发动起来的地区，要加强领导，普遍进行爱国主义教育，使运动继续深入提高。运动尚未开展或开展迟缓的地区，要结合当前生产工作，有步骤地发动群众，防止和克服运动中的缺乏领导的现象。各地都要总结发动竞赛的情况，取得领导经验；并通过检查，及时修订计划，表扬奖励竞赛中涌现的模范，普遍建立群众性的检查制度和组织，推动运动健康地发展。
    二、华东已建立了农业增产评奖委员会的组织，要在小麦收获之后，及时评奖。这个工作对于推动今后竞赛运动有重要意义。
    三、夏收之后，除进行评奖工作外，各地应以区为单位，由县派人指导，普遍召开参加竞赛的互助组代表会议，介绍模范，发扬积极因素，纠正各种缺点，使竞赛提高一步，并推动互助组的提高和巩固。
