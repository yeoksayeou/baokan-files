(Editor's note: The basic principle of agricultural production this year is to increase yield per unit area. However, are there still production potentials in the field of agricultural production, or what are those production potentials, and how should we bring them into play in order to increase the yield per unit area of farmland? We must conduct practical investigation and research on these issues. This investigation report of the Xinxian Local Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi provides some important materials and methods for solving these problems. We are publishing this investigation report for the reference of comrades who are leading agricultural production in various places.)

In order to realize the plan to increase grain production by 120 million catties on the agricultural production front in 1952, after the first conference of model workers in industry and agriculture in the entire region in 1952, we investigated the agricultural production potential of forty villages (five villages in Wutai, four villages in Dingxiang, four villages in Xinxian, five villages in Yangqu, six villages in Guoxian, six villages in Daixian, four villages in Ningwu, four villages in Jingle, and two villages in Fanshi. Among them, there are 26 villages in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas and 14 villages in plain areas.) from the labor models. The results of the investigation prove that whether in mountainous or plain areas, the potential for agricultural production is very strong. As long as the Party and the People's Government vigorously lead the peasants, break conservative thinking, change cultivation methods, and implement several major production reforms, agricultural production will have great development.

(1) Plant high-yield crops and cash crops, and rationally use land fertility

Xingao Village in Daixian has 130 mu of land, and the yield is the same whether planting sesame or sorghum. However, the value of sesame is twice that of sorghum. Beihu Village in Xinxian is a wheat-producing area, and plans to expand wheat fields by 2,000 mu, which can increase grain production by 3,200 dan compared with planting sorghum. Chinese yam and black wheat are high-yield crops in mountainous areas, which can increase production by one time compared with planting naked oats. Hanqu Village in Daixian has 100 mu of alkaline land, and planting sorghum only yields 8 dou per mu, while planting naked oats can yield 1 shi, and also produce 8 dou of stubble beans, which can increase production by a total of 110 shi. Twelve villages in Xinxian, Daixian, and Wutai have a total of 50,517 mu of land; if the crop planting structure is reorganized in 6,448 mu of land, 6,448 shi of coarse grains can be increased under the same production investment and cultivation conditions, which is equivalent to 17 percent of the total output of 37,600 shi. For thousands of years, under the control of feudal relations of production, the crops planted by peasants on the land mainly obeyed the requirements of a self-sufficient natural economy and inherent living habits, and it was impossible to use the land scientifically, thus seriously wasting land fertility. This situation must be reformed.

(2) Increase fertilizer application

The current amount of fertilizer applied to crops is very low. Generally, about 30 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu of paddy field, and 15 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu of flat and slope land. Most mountain lands are not fertilized. This is also a very serious waste and destruction of land fertility. The rich harvest experience of many labor models proves that appropriate fertilization is the key to agricultural high yield. Cui Ermao, a labor model in Xinxian, applied 11 large carts of fertilizer per mu of Chinese yam, and as a result, harvested 4,500 catties of Chinese yam per mu. According to the investigation, the current fertilizer source is abundant, and the plan to increase fertilizer application by 50 percent in 1952 can be realized under certain conditions. For this reason, it is necessary to: First, change the habit of burning livestock manure. Most mountainous areas and areas lacking fuel use livestock manure as fuel; some discard the fertilizer. This is a great loss. Wangjiazhuang in the fourth district of Guoxian burns and discards more than 24,000 dan of livestock manure every year. If these fertilizers are accumulated, each of the 7,680 mu of land in the village can get 3 dan, which is equivalent to 15 percent of the current amount of fertilizer applied. Second, advocate raising pigs and digging pig pens. At present, most areas do not have the habit of penning pigs, and a lot of pig manure is lost. Cuijiazhuang and Guanzhuang villages in Dingxiang have a total of 554 pigs, and the manure lost every year is at least more than 41,900 dan. Third, restore and develop sheep flocks. According to the investigation of nine villages, the current number of sheep is only 54 percent of that before the war. The reduction of sheep flocks in some areas is one of the basic reasons for the decline in agricultural production. Fourth, restore and develop oil mills to increase fine fertilizer. At present, the masses demand to buy fine fertilizer, but there are too few oil mills to meet the needs of the masses. In the Yangwu area of Guoxian, the oil pressing industry was very developed before the war, and there were usually more than 200 oil beams in operation; now only a dozen or so continue to operate. Fifth, advocate accumulating fertilizer and building kang. In the past, Daying and Nanyangdian villages in Guoxian built kang once every two years. If it is changed to building kang once a year, 35,000 dan of fertilizer can be increased, and an average of 4 dan can be increased per mu, which is equal to 20 percent of the current amount of fertilizer applied. In many villages in the mountainous area of Ningwu, a sanitation campaign can sweep up 20 dan of fertilizer per household. In addition, the method of fertilization should also be reformed. Many areas implement manure flooding, which is a great waste of fertilizer. If it is changed to concentrated fertilization, its benefit can be doubled. In the case of insufficient fertilizer, increasing fertilizer application should be concentrated on the most promising land, so as to receive the due benefits.

(3) Vigorously open canals and dig wells, and build water conservancy projects

Among these forty villages, 27 villages can develop water conservancy and increase paddy fields by 32,068 mu (excluding the Yangwu River in Guoxian). HuaiShuyuan, Hanqu, Shanghuazhuang, and Xigaoquan villages in Daixian have a total of 11,864 mu of land, of which 4,945 mu are paddy fields, and another 2,966 mu of paddy fields can be developed, accounting for 25 percent of the total land area. After increasing these paddy fields, 2,726 shi can be increased, which is equivalent to 22 percent of the total land output. This shows that the water conservancy potential in our area is very large. The key to tapping these potentials is: First, reform the feudal water regulations and thoroughly implement democratic management. This is a major problem that needs to be solved urgently. Last year, the Yangwu River in Guoxian partially reformed the feudal water regulations, increasing the irrigated land by 14,000 mu; if all the feudal water regulations are reformed, another 40,000 mu of paddy fields can be added, which is equivalent to one-third of the existing paddy fields. Second, change the old habit of not using water and vigorously develop small-scale water conservancy. The conditions for developing water conservancy in many areas are quite good, but the masses believe that "watering will not grow" and "watering will cost work", so they do not use water. Ningwu is an area with very poor water conservancy conditions, but if this old habit is changed, only more than ten villages such as Ermaying can open ten small canals and irrigate more than 6,000 mu of land. Third, dig wells in large quantities and promote waterwheels. Five of the forty villages have conditions for digging wells. Liushi Village in Xinxian has a total of 7,214 mu of land. If the old windlasses of 40 wells are replaced with waterwheels, and another 50 wells are dug and equipped with waterwheels, the village can increase paddy fields by 3,900 mu. Together with the old 2,500 mu, more than 90 percent of the village's land can be turned into paddy fields.

(4) Consolidate land and improve soil

After mountain land reclamation was prohibited, the masses' cultivated land was restricted. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the idea of long-term construction of mountain land and vigorously consolidate terraced fields. Ten villages can build 6,950 mu of terraced fields, increasing grain production by 3,265 shi. Zhang Mingzhong, a labor model in Maquan Village, Guoxian, has built ten mu of terraced fields in the past three years, and the yield per mu has increased from 2 dou to 1 shi. Under normal circumstances, terraced fields can increase production by at least one time compared with mountain land. The area of alkaline land in the plain area is very wide. In addition to planting alkali-resistant crops (such as naked oats and sunflowers), the geology must be fundamentally changed. The most effective method is to divert flood irrigation. Twelve villages have a total of 5,417 mu of alkaline land. If it is improved by flood irrigation, 2,464 shi of grain can be increased. According to the experience of Feng Laohu, a labor model in Daixian, 30 dan of loess can be padded per mu of alkaline land, which can increase production by 1 dou. General land should be consolidated by cutting inside and padding outside. Last year, Shangzhuang Village in Yangqu consolidated more than 2,000 mu of land, increasing grain production by 8,000 jin, which is equal to the output of 80 mu of land. In addition, there is a large amount of open space in mountain gullies and riverbeds, especially the land destroyed by the great flood in 1939, most of which has not been restored. Among the forty villages, there are still 22 villages that can expand cultivated land by 30,700 mu. For example, Shangzhuang Village in Guoxian can silt more than 200 mu of land, increasing grain production by 600 shi, which can increase the income of each household by an average of 3 shi of grain.

(5) Select excellent varieties and promote seed disinfection

After two years of vigorous promotion, the areas planting excellent varieties and implementing seed disinfection have gradually expanded. In addition to the local varieties cultivated by local farmers, the foreign excellent variety, Jinhuang Houyu corn, is the most popular among the masses (at least 25 percent more than the local varieties). According to the statistics of five villages in Yangqu, 50 percent of the land has been planted with excellent varieties (including local excellent varieties), with an average increase of 8 percent compared with local ordinary varieties. Three villages in Xinxian, Beihu, Liushi, and Yuechu, have a total of 4,200 mu of land planted with excellent varieties, accounting for 21 percent of the total land, with an increase of 1,140 shi compared with ordinary varieties, accounting for 6.3 percent of the total output. However, the masses in most areas do not trust excellent varieties. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the popularization of excellent varieties to an important link in the leadership of agricultural production. In some areas, the cultivated land implementing seed disinfection has reached 50 to 80 percent of the total cultivated land. Local experiences have proved that after seed disinfection, the yield can generally be increased by 5 to 10 percent. In areas planting naked oats, replacing liquor seed mixing with warm water seed soaking has been successfully tested by many labor models. Promoting this experience can save a lot of liquor. However, the masses are afraid of burning the seeds to death when soaking seeds, and most of them do not reach the due water temperature standard. The masses welcome thermometers very much and can be promoted in large quantities.

(6) Intensive cultivation and fine farming, and promotion of new farm tools

Most areas in our region do not have the habit of autumn plowing, and the number of hoeing and harrowing is also very small. Many cultivated lands are not hoeed at all. This habit must be changed. According to the experience of Zhang Ernian, a labor model, the land implementing autumn plowing yields 4 dou and 8 sheng of naked oats per mu, while the land not implementing autumn plowing yields only 3 dou and 6 sheng of naked oats per mu. If all 1,200 mu of naked oat land in the village implement autumn plowing, 144 shi can be increased. In terms of hoeing and harrowing, according to the experiment of Li Wenzai, a labor model in Wutai, hoeing millet four times increases the yield by 10 percent compared with hoeing twice. Using new-style walking plows is an important condition for improving cultivation efficiency and increasing production. According to the experiment of Luo Wenkao, a labor model in Guoxian, using new-style walking plows plows deeper, turns the soil evenly, and removes weeds cleanly, which increases the yield by about 25 percent compared with using old plows. After a year of promotion last year, the masses are happy to accept new-style plows and generally feel that the supply is in short supply. Among the forty villages, 25 villages have promoted 55 new-style walking plows, and this year they require to promote another 326, five times more than last year. According to this ratio, 5,000 new-style walking plows can be promoted in the whole region this year. The masses also welcome sprayers, and the eighth and ninth districts of Guoxian require to promote another 190 units. In addition, reorganizing plant and row spacing can also increase yield. According to Luo Wenkao's experiment, wide row spacing and dense plant spacing can increase yield by 20 percent. Therefore, labor models generally feel that the old seeding machines need to be reformed.

(7) Implement drought prevention and resistance, and fight against natural disasters

Our region has nine droughts in ten years, and implementing drought resistance and prevention is the basic guarantee for increasing agricultural production. Last year, our region had 65 percent of the harvest, which is inseparable from the implementation of the year-round drought resistance struggle. The experiences of forty labor models have proved that drought can be overcome. Zhu Wenhua, a labor model in Yangqu, led the peasants in Shangzhuang Village to implement more plowing, more harrowing, and early planting, so that the seedlings emerged from the soil as early as possible. This year, the surrounding villages only had 50 percent of the normal yield, while Shangzhuang Village increased the yield by an average of 6 sheng and 7 he per mu compared with normal years. Yuan Shangwan, a labor model in Guoxian, led Baijiawan to open two canals, turning 800 mu of wet land into good land. The surrounding villages only had 40 percent of the normal yield, and they reached 60 percent. Xie Bucai, a labor model in Xinxian, led the masses to carry water to water 150 mu of seedlings, and each mu yielded 2 large dou more grain than the unwatered land. Insect pests and animal pests cause great damage to crops. In our region, flower wives, black grandmothers, mole crickets, heartworms, walnut worms, and marmots are the most harmful. According to the experience of Zhao Shuancheng, a labor model in Jingle, thoroughly removing flower wives can ensure more than 40 percent of the Chinese yam production. The main way to prevent and control diseases and insect pests should be to give play to the creativity of the masses, and artificial capture should be emphasized at present. It has always been believed that heartworms cannot be removed. According to the experience of Li Wenzai, a labor model in Wutai, the rice stubble should be hooked off completely with a three-finger hook before autumn plowing. After hooking for three consecutive years, the heartworms can be eliminated. In the event of a major disaster, all the masses should be mobilized to encircle and suppress it. Last year, locusts occurred in more than ten villages in the Beihu area of Xinxian. The local leading organs immediately mobilized more than 10,000 people to annihilate all the locusts, which did not cause a disaster. Liu Yinghai, a labor model in Yangqu, set up killing areas and eliminated 3,400 marmots, reducing the loss of 60 shi of grain. "666" and DDT insecticide powders are generally welcomed by the masses and should be promoted.

(8) Develop animal husbandry

Our region has many mountains and has good conditions for developing animal husbandry. Before the Anti-Japanese War, animal husbandry in our region was quite developed, but after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, a lot of livestock was lost. Although it has been restored and developed in the past two years, it is still far from the level before the war. According to the statistics of eleven villages, there were 1,530 heads of draught animals before the war, and now there are only 884 heads left. The quality of livestock is also far inferior to that before the Anti-Japanese War. Six villages had 181 mules before the war, and now only 12 are left. The lack of draught animals is one of the basic reasons why agricultural production in some areas cannot be restored and developed quickly. This is most prominent in Guoxian. The Zhaoshenbao mutual aid group in Nanyangdian has 21 households, 300 mu of land, and only one and a half heads of draught animals. They spend 3.45 million yuan a year on hiring draught animals. The current problems in developing draught animals are: First, there are too few breeding stations and more should be added to reward the breeding of livestock. Second, after the land reform, the land is scattered, and it is difficult for many individual households to raise livestock. It is necessary to advocate organizing and raising livestock collectively. Third, the purchasing power of the masses is low, and they generally require livestock loans. Fourth, some areas still have agricultural socialist ideas, and there are still unreasonable phenomena in the burdens. For example, in some places in Guoxian, people receive livestock to perform duties, and livestock work is recorded but not manual work. Sheep have the highest reproduction rate, but the recovery and development are the slowest. The basic reasons for the shrinking of sheep flocks, in addition to the destruction by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, are mainly that the local Party and the People's Government have neglected the breeding and protection of sheep flocks in recent years, the labor-capital is uncoordinated, and there is a lack of leadership for the shepherd workers. This situation must be changed.

(9) Develop forestry

The conditions for afforestation in our region are also very good. In the past two years, forests have developed rapidly. Twenty-six mountainous and semi-mountainous villages have conditions for closing mountains for afforestation, and there are also many open spaces for afforestation in villages along the river. Most villages can plant fruit trees. This is an important condition for long-term construction of mountain land and gradually making mountain land prosperous. Zhang Baoda, a labor model in Jingle, planted two mu of trees in 1937, thinned them once in 1950, and built five houses in 1951. Last year, the village's income from selling trees reached more than 14 million yuan. The current problems in developing forestry are: First, the masses still lack the idea of long-term construction. Second, the work of protecting forests is generally not valued enough, and many small trees are planted, but the survival rate is not high. Third, there is a lack of fruit tree seedlings. These problems should be solved quickly.

(10) Develop sideline occupations

Sideline production has developed more than before the Anti-Japanese War in the past two years. Generally, the income from sideline occupations in mountainous villages accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the total agricultural income of farmers, and about 20 percent in plain areas. All 40 households in Zhuang'er Village (mountainous area) in Yangqu have sideline production. Last year, the village's sideline income reached 40,920 jin of millet, with an average net income of 830 jin of millet per household. Last year, the sideline income of Beihu Village (plain area) in Xinxian accounted for 30 percent of the total agricultural income. Their sideline income is so rich mainly because the Party branch led the masses to turn sideline production into organized actions, finding an outlet for the rural surplus labor force. The potential of sideline production is very large, and most villages can exceed the current level by one time. In order to develop sideline occupations, two problems must be solved: First, sideline production must be combined with agricultural production and with the supply and marketing and credit cooperative business. The sideline occupations in Zhuang'er Village and Beihu Village are doing well mainly because they have implemented organization and extracted a large number of surplus labor force. The Beihu Credit Cooperative has also solved the financial difficulties for sideline producers. Second, solve the mountain traffic problem. The second district of Fanshi is rich in mountain products, but it cannot be transported out due to inconvenient transportation. Solving the transportation problem can promote further development of sideline occupations.

×××

As long as we can tap these production potentials, some areas with better production conditions can increase production by more than 50 percent on the existing level, and individual villages can even exceed one time; areas with poorer production conditions can also increase production by 30 percent. The conditions for tapping these potentials exist, and it can be done in general areas in three to five years. This requires implementing the policy of rural collectivization and comprehensively organizing. At present, only 14.8 percent of the full labor force and semi-labor force in the whole region are organized. The forty labor model villages generally reach 30 to 60 percent. According to their plan, 80 percent of the full labor force and semi-labor force can be organized in 1952. Realizing this plan can free up 20 to 30 percent of the surplus labor force. Nandiandian Village in Guoxian has a total of 300 male laborers and 5,230 mu of land, with an average of 17 mu cultivated per person, but in fact, one person can cultivate 24 mu. If 80 percent of the male laborers are organized, 87 male laborers can be left over, accounting for 29 percent of the total number of male full laborers and semi-laborers. If 50 percent of the female laborers are mobilized again, the surplus labor force can reach 54 percent. In terms of cooperative undertakings: all forty villages have members of supply and marketing cooperatives. Generally, 40 percent of the households in the plain areas have joined the cooperatives, and only 10 percent of the households in the mountainous areas have joined the cooperatives. In the past year, supply and marketing cooperatives have played a great role in organizing members to produce. The Wangzi Village Cooperative in Wutai has sold a total value of 130 million yuan of agricultural and sideline products of the masses and supplied a total value of 80 million yuan of production and living materials to the masses in one year, enabling the members to obtain the benefits of 50,000 jin of millet and helping the masses to build 30 houses and repair more than 200 dilapidated houses. However, some masses are not enthusiastic about participating in the supply and marketing cooperatives, and even withdraw the shares of the supply and marketing cooperatives to join the credit cooperatives. The main reason is that these cooperatives cannot implement the policy of serving the members. Five villages have credit cooperatives, which have solved a lot of problems and are very popular among the masses. In the past year, the Beihu Credit Cooperative in Xinxian has helped the masses to repair a canal, change the soil of 600 mu of alkaline land, increase grain production by 240 shi, and organize 109 people to carry out sideline production, with a profit of more than 79,000 jin of millet, which is equivalent to 31 percent of the total agricultural production income of the whole village. That is to say, organizing the huge surplus labor force and the funds of the masses in the countryside is enough to tap the production potentials mentioned above. But to achieve this task, we must wage a serious struggle against the "production spontaneity" thinking of district and village cadres and the masses. Those who advocate production spontaneity are satisfied with the backward state of small production, cannot see the production potential, are unwilling to actively carry out various reforms in agricultural production, and hold a pessimistic attitude towards agricultural production. They cannot see the superiority of the people's democratic system and believe that what could not be done in the old society cannot be done in the new society. They do not actively fight against various difficulties in production, so in practical work, they separate the tasks of political struggle from the tasks of economic construction. They cannot see the future of the revolution, yearn for the capitalist way of getting rich, and therefore do not hope for any leadership. This thinking is the basic obstacle to achieving the above tasks. We believe that the county party committee, the district party committee, and even the village-level party branch should conduct an in-depth investigation and calculation of the local production potential, and formulate a longer-term (such as three to five years) production and construction plan based on the actual situation as a goal to mobilize the entire party and the entire people to strive for production.

    山西忻县地区四十个村农业生产潜在能力的调查
    中共忻县地方委员会
    编者按：今年农业生产的基本方针是提高单位面积产量。但是，在农业生产领域内，是不是还有生产潜力，或者还有那些生产潜力，应该怎样把它发挥出来，以便提高农田单位面积产量？对于这些问题，我们必须加以切实的调查研究。中共山西忻县地方委员会的这个调查报告，提供了解决这些问题的一些重要材料和办法。我们把这个调查报告发表出来，供各地领导农业生产的同志们研究参考。
    为了实现一九五二年在农业生产战线上增产一亿二千万斤粮食的计划，我们在一九五二年全专区首届工农业劳动模范会议后，向劳动模范调查了四十个村（五台五村、定襄四村、忻县四村、阳曲五村、崞县六村、代县六村、宁武四村、静乐四村、繁峙二村。其中山区半山区二十六个村，平川地区十四个村。）的关于农业生产潜在能力的情况。调查的结果证明：无论山地与平川，农业生产的潜在能力都是十分雄厚的。只要党和人民政府大力领导农民，打破保守思想，改变耕作方法，实行几项主要的生产改革，农业生产就会有很大的发展。
    （一）种植多产作物和经济作物，合理地使用地力
    代县新高村有一百三十亩地，种胡麻或高粱，产量相同。而胡麻价值高于高粱的一倍。忻县北湖村是产麦区，计划扩大麦田二千亩，比种高粱增产三千二百石粮食。山药、黑麦是山区的多产作物，较种莜麦增产一倍。代县韩曲村有一百亩碱地，每亩种高粱只产八斗，种莜麦可产一石，还可产八斗回茬豆子，共可增产一百一十石。忻县、代县、五台有十二个村，共有五万零五百一十七亩土地；其中六千四百四十八亩土地如实行作物播种的改组，则在生产投资、耕作条件相同的情况下，可以增产六千四百四十八石粗粮，相当于总产量三万七千六百石的百分之十七。几千年来，在封建的生产关系支配下，农民在田地上种植作物，主要服从于自给自足的自然经济的要求和固有的生活习惯，不可能科学地使用土地，因此严重地浪费了地力。这种情况必须加以改革。
    （二）增施肥料
    目前农作物的施肥量都很低，一般水地每亩平均施肥三十担左右，平地和坡地每亩平均施肥十五担左右，大多数山地是不施肥的。这对地力的浪费和破坏也是十分严重的。许多劳动模范的丰产经验证明：适量施肥是农业丰产的关键。忻县劳动模范崔二毛，每亩山药施肥十一大车，结果每亩山药收获了四千五百斤。据调查，目前肥源是充沛的，一九五二年增施肥料百分之五十的计划是有条件实现的。为此必须：第一、改变烧牲畜肥的习惯。多数山区和燃料缺乏的地区，都以牲畜肥作燃料；有的把肥料丢掉了。这是一项很大的损失。崞县四区王家庄每年烧掉和丢掉的牲畜肥料达二万四千余担。如把这些肥料积存起来，全村七千六百八十亩土地，每亩可以得到三担，相当于目前施肥数量的百分之十五。第二、提倡养猪，提倡挖猪圈。目前绝大多数地区没有圈猪习惯，许多猪粪都损失了。定襄崔家庄、管庄村共有五百五十四只猪，每年丢掉的粪至少在四万一千九百担以上。第三、恢复和发展羊群。据九个村调查，目前羊的数目仅及战前的百分之五十四，某些地区羊群减少，是农业生产降低的基本原因之一。第四、恢复和发展油坊，增加细肥。目前群众都要求买细肥，但油坊太少，不能满足群众的要求。崞县阳武一带七、八个村庄，战前榨油业很发达，通常有二百多条油梁开工；现在继续开工的只留下十多条了。第五、提倡积肥、打炕。崞县大营、南阳店两村过去每二年打炕一次，如改为每一年打炕一次，可以增加肥料三万五千担，平均每亩可以增加四担，等于目前施肥数量的百分之二十。宁武山地许多村庄，进行一次清洁卫生运动，每户可以打扫二十担肥料。另外，在施肥方法上也是应该改革的。许多地区实行漫粪，这对肥料是一种很大的浪费，如改为集中施肥，其效益可以提高一倍。在肥料不足的情况下，增施肥料应该集中在最有出息的土地上，这样才能收到应有的效益。
    （三）大力开渠打井，兴修水利
    这四十个村中，有二十七个村都可以发展水利，能增加水地三万二千零六十八亩（崞县阳武河除外）。代县槐树院、韩曲、上花庄、西高泉等四个村有土地一万一千八百六十四亩，其中有水地四千九百四十五亩，还可以再发展水地二千九百六十六亩，占土地总面积的百分之二十五。增加这些水地后，可以增产二千七百二十六石，相当于土地总产量的百分之二十二。这说明我区水利潜在能力是很大的。发掘这些潜在能力的关键是：第一、改革封建水规，彻底实行民主管理。这是一个急待解决的大问题。崞县阳武河去年部分改革封建水规，增浇土地一万四千亩；如果全部改革封建水规，还可再增加水地四万亩，相当于现有水地的三分之一。第二、改变有水不使的旧习惯，大力发展小型水利。许多地区发展水利的条件相当好，但群众认为“水浇了就不长了”，“水浇了费作务”，因而有水不加利用。宁武是水利条件很差的地区，但如果改变了这种旧习惯，仅二马营等十多个村，即可开小渠十道，浇地六千多亩。第三、大量打井，推广水车。四十个村中有五个村都有打井条件。忻县六石村共有土地七千二百一十四亩，如把旧有四十眼井的辘轳换成水车，再打五十眼井安上水车，全村可以增加水地三千九百亩，连旧有的二千五百余亩计算在内，可使全村百分之九十以上的土地变成水田。
    （四）整修土地，改良土壤
    山地禁止开荒以后，群众耕地受了限制。因此，必须树立长期建设山地的思想，大力整修梯田。有十个村可修六千九百五十亩梯田，增产三千二百六十五石粮食。崞县马圈村劳动模范张明中三年来修成十亩梯田，每亩产量由二斗提高到一石。在通常情况下，梯田最低限度比山地可增产一倍。平川地区碱地面积十分广阔，除了种植抗碱作物（如莜麦、葵花）外，必须从根本上改变地质。最有效的办法是引洪水灌溉。十二个村共有碱地五千四百一十七亩，如用洪水灌溉的方法加以改良，可以增产二千四百六十四石粮食。另据代县劳动模范冯老虎的经验，每亩碱地垫黄土三十担，可增产一斗。一般土地应该用里切外垫办法进行整修。阳曲上庄村去年整修土地二千多亩，增产粮食八千斤，等于八十亩地的产量。此外，在山沟、河床间还有大量空地，特别是一九三九年大水冲毁的土地，多数尚未恢复起来。四十个村中，还有二十二个村可以扩大耕地三万零七百亩。如崞县上庄村可以淤地二百多亩，增产粮食六百石，可使每户平均增加三石粮食的收入。
    （五）选用优良品种，推行籽种消毒
    经过两年以来的大力提倡，种植优良品种和实行籽种消毒的地区已逐渐扩大。优良品种除本地农民培育者外，外来优良品种，金黄后玉茭最受群众欢迎（最低可比本地品种增产百分之二十五）。据阳曲五个村的统计，已经有百分之五十的土地种植优良品种（包括本地优良品种），平均较本地普通品种增产百分之八。忻县北湖、六石、月蜍等三个村共有四千二百亩土地种植优良品种，占土地总数的百分之二十一，较普通品种增产一千一百四十石，占总产量的百分之六点三。但多数地区群众还不信任优良品种。因此，必须把普及优良品种提到农业生产领导的重要环节上来。有些地区，实行籽种消毒的耕地，已达耕地总数的百分之五十至八十。各地经验都证明：经过籽种消毒，一般可增产百分之五至十。种植莜麦地区，以温汤浸种代替烧酒拌种，业经许多劳动模范试验成功。推广这个经验，可节约很多烧酒。但群众在浸种时，害怕把籽种烧死，大多数达不到应有的水温标准。群众很欢迎温度表，可以大量推广。
    （六）精耕细作，推广新式农具
    我区多数地区没有秋耕习惯，锄耧次数也很少。许多耕地根本不锄。这种习惯必须改变。据劳动模范张二念的经验，实行秋耕的地，每亩收莜麦四斗八升，不实行秋耕的地，每亩只收莜麦三斗六升。全村
    一千二百亩莜麦地都实行秋耕，可以增产一百四十四石。在锄耧方面，根据五台劳动模范李稳在的试验，谷子锄四次，比锄二次增产百分之十。使用新式步犁是提高耕作效率、增加生产的重要条件。据崞县劳动模范罗文考的试验，使用新式步犁耕地深、翻土匀、除草净，比用旧犁耕地约增产百分之二十五。经过去年一年的推广，群众乐于接受新式犁，普遍感到供不应求。四十个村中，已有二十五村推广新式步犁五十五张，今年要求再推广三百二十六张，比去年增加五倍。根据这个比例，今年全区可以推广新式步犁五千张。群众也很欢迎喷雾器，崞县八、九区即要求再推广一百九十台。此外，改组株、行距也可以增加产量，据罗文考的试验，宽行距、密株距可以增产百分之二十。因此，劳动模范普遍感到旧耧车有改革的必要。
    （七）贯彻防旱抗旱，和自然灾害作斗争
    我区十年九旱，贯彻抗旱防旱是农业增产的基本保证。去年我区有六成半的收成，这是和贯彻了全年的抗旱斗争分不开的。四十个劳动模范的经验都证明旱灾是可以战胜的。阳曲劳动模范朱文华领导上庄村农民实行多耕、多耙、早种，使禾苗早日出土。这一年周围村庄只有五成年景，而上庄村每亩平均还比常年增产六升七合粮食。崞县劳动模范原尚万领导白家湾开渠两道，把八百亩隰地变成良田，周围村庄只有四成年景，他们达到了六成。忻县解补财领导群众担水浇苗一百五十亩，每亩较未浇的地多收粮二大斗。虫害兽害对庄稼的损害很大，我区以花媳妇、黑婆、蝼蛄、钻心虫、核桃虫、犵狸等为害最烈。据静乐劳动模范赵拴成的经验，彻底除治花媳妇，山药可以保产百分之四十以上。防除病虫害主要应发挥群众的创造性，在目前应着重人工捕杀。钻心虫一向认为无法除治。据五台劳动模范李稳在经验，秋耕前用三指钩将谷茬全部钩掉，连钩三年，钻心虫即可绝迹。遇有大的灾害发生，应即动员全体群众进行围剿。去年忻县北湖地区十余村发生蝗虫，当地领导机关立即动员万余人将蝗虫全歼，未造成灾害。阳曲劳动模范刘应海设置杀伤区，消灭犵狸三千四百个，减少了六十石粮食的损失。“六六六”、滴滴涕等杀虫药粉，普遍受到群众欢迎，应该推广使用。
    （八）发展牧畜
    我区山多，发展牧畜的条件很好。抗战前我区牧畜业相当发达，但经过八年抗战，牲畜损失很多。虽经二年来的恢复和发展，仍离战前的水平甚远在据十一个村统计，战前有耕畜一千五百三十头，现在只剩下八百八十四头。牲畜质量也远不如抗战前。六个村抗战前有骡子一百八十一头，现在只剩下十二头。耕畜不足，是某些地区农业生产不能迅速恢复和发展的基本原因之一，这在崞县表现得最为突出。南阳店赵申保互助组二十一户，三百亩土地，只有一头半耕畜。他们每年花在雇耕畜上面的钱即达三百四十五万元。目前发展耕畜的问题是：第一、种畜站太少，应再加增设，奖励繁殖牲畜。第二、土地改革后土地分散，许多单干户养畜困难，应提倡组织起来，集体养畜。第三、群众购买力低，普遍要求牲畜贷款。第四、某些地区群众还有农业社会主义思想，负担上也还存在着不合理的现象。如崞县某些地方人领牲畜服勤务，记畜工不记人工。羊的繁殖率最大，但恢复和发展的最慢。羊群缩小的基本原因，除抗战期间日寇的摧残外，主要是近年来当地党和人民政府忽视繁殖和保护羊群，劳资不协调，对牧羊工人缺乏领导。这一情况必须改变。
    （九）发展林业
    我区造林的条件也是很好的，二年来，树林发展很快。二十六个山地、半山地村，都有封山育林的条件，沿河村庄造林的空地也很多，大多数村都可以种植果木树。这是长期建设山地，使山地逐步走上富裕的重要条件。静乐劳动模范张保大一九三七年种二亩树，一九五零年间伐一次，一九五一年就盖了五间房，该村去年卖树收入达一千四百多万元。目前发展林业的问题是：第一、群众还缺乏长期建设的思想。第二、护林工作普遍不够重视，小树栽的不少，成活率不大。第三、缺乏果木树秧。这些问题，应该迅速加以解决。
    （十）发展副业
    两年来副业生产比抗战前有发展。一般的山地村，副业收入占农民农业总收入的百分之二十五至三十，平川地区亦占百分之二十左右。阳曲庄儿上（山区）四十户都有副业生产，全村去年副业收入达四万零九百二十斤小米，每户平均净收入八百三十斤小米。忻县北湖村（平川）去年副业收入占农业总收入的百分之三十。他们的副业收入这样丰富，主要是由于党支部领导群众把副业生产变成了有组织的行动，给农村剩余劳动力找到了出路。副业生产的潜在能力很大，多数村庄都可以超过现有水平的一倍。为了发展副业，必须解决两个问题：第一、副业生产必须和农业生产结合起来，和供销、信用合作事业结合起来。庄儿上和北湖村的副业搞得好，主要是由于实行了组织起来，抽出了大批剩余劳动力。北湖信用社又给副业生产者解决了资金困难。第二、解决山地交通问题。繁峙二区盛产山货，但由于交通不便，运不出来。解决了交通问题，即可促使副业进一步发展起来。
    ×××
    我们只要能够把这些生产潜在能力发掘出来，某些生产条件较好的地区，就可以在现有水平上增产百分之五十以上，个别村子还可以超过一倍；生产条件较差的地区也可以增产百分之三十。发掘这些潜在能力的条件是存在的，一般地区在三、五年内就可以作到。这就必须贯彻农村合作化的方针，全面地组织起来。目前全区组织起来的全劳力和半劳力只有百分之十四点八，四十个劳动模范村，一般达到百分之三十至六十。根据他们的计划，一九五二年内可以把百分之八十的全劳力和半劳力组织起来。实现了这个计划，就可以腾出百分之二十至三十的剩余劳力。崞县南店村共有三百个男劳力，五千二百三十亩土地，每人平均耕作十七亩，但实际上一个人可以耕作二十四亩。如果把百分之八十的男劳力组织起来，即可剩余八十七个男劳力，占男全劳力和半劳力总数的百分之二十九，如再把百分之五十的女劳力发动起来，剩余劳力可以达到百分之五十四。合作事业方面：四十个村都有了供销合作社社员，平川地区一般有百分之四十的农户入社，山地只有百分之十的农户。一年来供销社在组织社员生产上已起了很大作用。五台湾子村合作社一年内推销群众农副产品总值一亿三千万元，供给群众生产生活资料总值八千万元，使社员得到五万斤小米的利益，帮助群众盖房三十间，补修破房二百余间。但也有些群众对参加供销社的情绪不高，甚至抽了供销社股金去入信用合作社。主要原因是这些合作社不能贯彻为社员服务的方针。五个村有了信用合作社，解决问题很大，很受群众欢迎。忻县北湖信用合作社一年来帮助群众修渠一道，改变六百亩碱地土壤，增产粮食二百四十石，组织一百零九人进行副业生产，获利小米七万九千多斤，相当于全村农业生产总收入的百分之三十一。这就是说，把农村里庞大的剩余劳动力和群众的资金组织起来，是足以发掘出上面说的那些潜在能力的。但是要实现这个任务，必须向区村干部和群众的“生产自发论”思想作严重的斗争。生产自发论者，满足于小生产的落后状态，看不到生产潜在能力，不愿积极进行农业生产上的各项改革，对农业生产抱悲观主义的态度。他们看不到人民民主制度的优越性，认为旧社会做不到的事新社会也做不到。他们不积极和生产上的各种困难作斗争，因此，在实际工作上就把政治斗争任务与经济建设任务分割开来。他们看不到革命的前途，憧憬着资本主义式的发财道路，因此也不希望有什么领导。这种思想是实现以上任务的基本障碍。我们认为，县委、区委直至村级党的支部，都应该对当地生产潜在能力作一次深入调查和计算，针对实际情况，订出一个较长期的（如三年至五年）生产建设计划，作为动员全党全民生产奋斗的目标。
