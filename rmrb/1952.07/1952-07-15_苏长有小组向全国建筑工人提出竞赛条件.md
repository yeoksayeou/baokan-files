The Su Changyou bricklaying group of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company proposed five competition conditions on May 12th, challenging construction workers nationwide. Since then, many groups in Northeast China, Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan and other places have responded to the challenge of the Su Changyou group. Xie Wanfu's group, which created the woodworking assembly line method, and Yang Dezhong's group, which created the plastering assembly line method, responded to the challenge of the Su Changyou group while also challenging carpenters and plasterers in the national construction industry with the conditions of the response. The Tianjin Fu Hongbin bricklaying group, which created the mortar spreader, also responded to the challenge and challenged construction workers in North China with the same conditions. At present, the Construction Workers' Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Construction Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council have jointly issued a notice, notifying the organizations at all levels in various parts of the country to mobilize the workers to respond to the challenge of the Su Changyou group. Therefore, the patriotic production increase and economy competition movement among construction workers caused by the challenge of the Su Changyou group will be launched nationwide. The five challenge conditions of the Su Changyou group are:

    I. Learn from the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union, implement new technology operating procedures to meet the quality requirements of the new design standards, and ensure no rework.

    II. On the basis of ensuring quality, further improve labor organization, implement the double-hand slurry squeezing method, and gradually research and improve tools to improve work efficiency. Ensure that each person averages 2,700 bricks per day; the whole group (20 people, four second-class workers, two fourth-class workers, and fourteen apprentices) will complete the task of laying 8,262,000 bricks in 153 construction workdays this year, saving 4,170 workdays compared to the labor rate stipulated by the Northeast People's Government Industry Department this year, an increase in production of 155.03 million yuan (calculated at 37,000 yuan per workday).

    III. On the premise of ensuring quality, reduce the material consumption rate. Reduce red bricks from the budgeted 2 percent to 0.3 percent, saving 140,450 bricks. Reduce lime from the budgeted 10 percent to 2 percent, saving 48.7 tons. Reduce cement from the budgeted 2 percent to 0.5 percent, saving 9.6 tons. Reduce sand and gravel from the budgeted 15 percent to 4 percent, saving 456 cubic meters. The four kinds of materials are converted into 86.5 million yuan, plus the above production increase figure, totaling 380 tons of grain.

    IV. Strengthen political and cultural learning. Study for one hour every day, ensuring that the whole group eliminates illiteracy in 1952, and those with low cultural levels also learn to read newspapers. Hold a life review meeting once a week to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    V. Make a good daily work plan, implement the inspection system, and strengthen on-site security work to ensure that no liability accidents occur.

    苏长有小组向全国建筑工人提出竞赛条件
    东北工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处苏长有瓦工小组，于五月十二日提出五个竞赛条件，向全国建筑工人挑战以来，东北地区和北京、天津、太原等地已有不少小组向苏长有小组应战。创造木工流水作业法的谢万福小组和创造抹灰工流水作业法的杨德重小组，已向苏长有小组应战同时又以应战条件分别向全国建筑业中的木工和抹灰工挑战。创造铺灰器的天津傅鸿宾瓦工小组，也在应战同时，以同样条件向全华北的建筑工人挑战。目前，中华全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会和政务院财经委员会总建筑处已联合发出通知，通知所属全国各地的各级组织发动工人群众向苏长有小组应战；因此，由苏长有小组挑战而引起的建筑工人间的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，将在全国范围内展开。苏长有小组的五个挑战条件是：
    一、学习苏联先进技术经验，贯彻新技术操作规程达到新设计标准的质量要求，并保证不返工。
    二、在保证质量的基础上，进一步改进劳动组织，实行双手挤浆法，逐步研究改进工具，提高工作效率。保证每人每天平均要砌砖二千七百块；全组（二十人，四名二等工，两名四等工，十四名徒工）在今年一百五十三个施工工作日中完成砌砖八百二十六万二千块的任务，比今年东北人民政府工业部规定的工率节省四千一百七十个工，计增产一亿五千五百零三万元（每工以三万七千元计算）。
    三、在保证质量的条件下，降低材料消耗率。红砖由预算规定的百分之二降低到百分之零点三，计节省十四万零四百五十块。白灰由预算规定的百分之十降低到百分之二，计节省四十八点七吨。洋灰由预算规定的百分之二降低到百分之零点五，计节省九点六吨。砂石由预算规定的百分之十五，降低到百分之四，计节省四百五十六立方米。四种材料折成人民币计八千六百五十万元，加上上述增产数字，共计三百八十吨粮食。
    四、加强政治学习与文化学习。每日学习一小时，保证在一九五二年中全组消灭文盲，文化水平低的也学会看报。每周开一次生活检讨会，开展批评与自我批评。
    五、作好每日工作计划，贯彻检查制度，并加强工地保安工作，保证不发生责任事故。
