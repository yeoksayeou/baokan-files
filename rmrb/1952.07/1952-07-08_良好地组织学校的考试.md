Abstracts from Soviet Newspaper Articles:

    "Izvestia" published an article by Orlov, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, on May 14th, discussing how to organize school examinations. The abstract is as follows:

    Two years ago, the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation Republic and all national education workers noted the necessity of eliminating the excessive burden on students during the preparation and examination periods. To this end, and also to strengthen the current work on calculating student grades, the Ministry of Education of the Republic approved new regulations: "Regulations on Holding Promotion and Graduation Examinations in Primary Schools, Seven-Year Schools, and Secondary Schools, and on Holding Secondary School Graduation Diploma Examinations." These regulations stipulate that the number of examinations in individual grades should be reduced, and the scope of examination topics for certain courses should be narrowed.

    To alleviate students' preparation for examinations, the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation Republic has done much to improve the examination review questions. Currently, the review questions for each subject have a certain order that is adapted to the arrangement of teaching materials in school teaching plans and textbooks. In this way, there are certain steps in reviewing the teaching materials, eliminating the major shortcomings of the past where the review was often completely divorced from the teaching plan. It is particularly important to emphasize this because examination preparation in schools should not and cannot be in the nature of simply coping with the examination. Examinations require each student to be able to give a practical explanation of a kind of knowledge in accordance with a certain system, and to be good at using specific examples from the surrounding reality to prove their answers. Those teachers who turn the review into a simple way to cope with the exam are pushing the children onto the road of mechanically memorizing answers. Under such an organized review, students will find it difficult to answer if they encounter different forms of questions.

    During the preparation and examination period, students—especially those in graduating classes—should not be busy with work other than studying and other social tasks. All extracurricular and group work, whether it is within the school or in external institutions, should be stopped.

    Measures to make it easier for students during examinations and examination preparation are by no means intended to lower the requirements for students' knowledge levels. In the Soviet Union, these requirements have been increasing year by year, and this is completely in line with the rules. Therefore, all attempts to assess student grades in a lenient attitude and arbitrarily raise examination scores should be resolutely condemned and stopped.

    In Soviet schools, examinations are one of the effective and reliable ways to check teaching results. The degree and quality of students' knowledge can be explained by the results of various examinations. This is also the basic indicator and the most accurate standard for evaluating the work of the entire school and individual teachers. Therefore, all national education authorities and school principals should most seriously prepare for the supervision of the examination process, and accumulate materials from the first day of the examination to make a comprehensive summary of the work of the school and teachers over the year.

    It must be noted that merely using the number of students who pass the examination and the number of students who participate in re-examinations or repeat grades in the autumn and comprehensive materials cannot reflect the complex and multifaceted teaching process. We must also conduct an in-depth analysis of all aspects of the school's teaching work. Students' answers should be studied to understand what the specific manifestations of teaching ideas are and how they are affecting students' thinking.

    It is wrong to only use examinations as the only tool to check students' knowledge and calculate student grades. It should be understood that the various examinations held in Soviet schools are also one of the most important links in the educational process. It enables us to correctly judge the superiority of a certain teacher's teaching method and determine the actual effect and final conclusion of his work.

### 良好地组织学校的考试

    良好地组织学校的考试
    “消息报”五月十四日发表了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国教育部副部长奥尔洛夫论述如何组织学校考试的论文，摘要如下：
    两年以前，俄罗斯联邦共和国的教育部和所有的国民教育工作者，曾注意到消除学生在准备和进行考试时期中负担过重现象的必要性。为了这个目的，同时也为了加强目前对学生成绩的计算工作，共和国的教育部曾批准了新的条例：“关于在初级小学、七年制学校和中学中举行升级和毕业考试与举行中学毕业文凭考试的条例”。这个条例规定：在个别的年级中应减少考试的次数，同时应缩小某些课程考试题材的范围。
    为减轻学生对于考试的准备工作，俄罗斯联邦共和国的教育部曾做了很多改善考试复习题的工作。目前，每种科目的复习题，都具有与学校教学计划和课本中教材的配置相适应的一定顺序，这样，在复习教材时，就有了一定的步骤，消除了过去所时常发生的复习与教学计划完全脱节的重大缺点。强调这一点是特别重要的，因为学校中的考试准备不应当也不能带有应付考试的性质。考试时要求每个学生能依照一定的系统对一种知识作切实的阐述，并善于以周围现实中的具体例子来证实自己的答案。那些把复习变为简单的应付考试的教师们，把孩子们推向呆板地死啃答案的路上去。在这样组织的复习下，学生们如果遇到不同形式的问题，就会感到解答困难。
    在准备和举行考试的时间，不应当让学生——特别是毕业班的学生——忙于从事学习以外的工作和其他社会任务。所有课外的和小组的工作，不管它是校内的还是校外机关的，都应当予以停止。
    使学生在考试和考试准备期间比较轻松的措施，决不是要降低对学生知识水平的要求。在苏联，这类要求一贯是逐年在提高着，而这是完全合乎规律的。因此，对于一切以纵容态度来评定学生成绩和任意提高考试分数的企图，都应当坚决地予以谴责和制止。
    在苏联的学校中，考试是检查教学成果的有效的可靠方法之一。学生知识的程度和质量可由各种考试结果说明。而这也是评定整个学校工作和个别教师工作的基本指标和最确实的标准。因此，各国民教育机关和各校校长应当最严肃地准备好对考试过程的监督，并从考试开始的第一日起累积材料，以便对学校和教师的一年来的工作作出综合和总结。
    必须注意到仅以考试及格的学生数量和在秋季参加复试或留级的学生的数量和综合材料，是不能反映出复杂的、多方面的教学过程的。我们还必须对学校的教学工作的各方面进行深入的分析。应当研究学生的答案，并了解：那些是教学思想方针的具体表现以及它是在怎样影响学生的思想。
    仅仅把考试做为检查学生知识和计算学生成绩的唯一工具的办法是错误的。应当懂得，苏维埃学校中所举行的各种考试，同时也是教育过程中的一个最重要的环节。它使我们能正确地判断某一个教师的教学法的优越并判定他的工作的实际效果和最后总结。
