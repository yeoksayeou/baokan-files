Reader's Letters
How should we correctly treat economic work?
Editor's Note: The reader's letter "How should we correctly treat economic work" published in this column today illustrates that economic workers, as long as they stand firm and are loyal to the revolutionary cause, can be immune to the corruption of bourgeois ideology and avoid being dragged down by unscrupulous merchants. Doing all logistical and technical work is beneficial to the revolution and will be respected by the masses and commended by the organization.
We will publish some readers' letters next week with opinions on the cultivation and education of economic workers. We hope that comrades engaged in economic work will put forward active suggestions and requirements from their personal experiences, and we also hope that Party committees and administrative leaders at all levels will put forward systematic opinions. The upsurge of national economic construction is about to arrive, and the cultivation and education of economic workers should be one of the important issues at present. We hope that everyone will pay attention to the discussion of this issue and actively put forward constructive opinions.
Shouldering all accounting work
Editor: I am a member of the Communist Youth League. I have been doing accounting work in the organization for more than two years. In April 1950, shortly after I was transferred to this position, the original two accounting comrades, one went to recuperate and the other was transferred away from the organization, and all accounting work was borne by me alone. At that time, my thoughts were very contradictory. On the one hand, I was afraid that I could not bear this heavy task, because I had learned old-style accounting in the past and was not familiar with new-style bookkeeping; on the other hand, I thought of the education of the Party and the League, and revolutionary youths must never bow to difficulties. After a fierce ideological struggle, I decided to study hard, overcome difficulties, and complete the task assigned by the Party. So I calmed down and, with the help of leading cadres and comrades, quickly learned new-style accounting and took on all the accounting work of the General Affairs Section.
Later, the organization streamlined its staff and required cadres to further improve work efficiency and increase work tasks. In addition to doing accounting work, I also had to take on the organization's funds, operating expenses, purchasing, storage, and auditing work. In the case of fewer people and more work, I knew that only by improving work methods could I complete the task. So I used my brain to study the work. For example, in the past, the procedures for issuing subsidies in our organization were very complicated. Various subsidies were collected in installments, and it took eight hours to issue one subsidy, which made the accounting staff very busy and prone to errors, and it was also inconvenient for the comrades who received the subsidies. After research, I made a detailed supplementary subsidy form, filled in all kinds of subsidies received by each person into a form, calculated the net amount received by each person, and collected it at one time. In this way, it only took three hours to complete the issuance, saving five hours compared to before.
Next, I made a comparative table of income and expenditure of the organization's funds, and compiled the monthly income and expenditure in a table. From the cumulative figures of each month, you can see the entire income and expenditure of the organization's funds, and you don't have to do temporary statistics every time you report the budget income and expenditure. In addition, I also made a statistical table of fixed property furniture, a statistical table of houses, etc., which played a certain role in simplifying work procedures, saving work time, and eliminating errors.
In the past two years, I have learned a truth from my personal experience: no matter what kind of work, as long as you go deep, you can find "principles" and "knowledge," and you can have creation and improvement, but the key lies in whether you are loyal to the revolutionary cause and whether you have used your brain. Although I have done very little for the people, the leadership has constantly given me encouragement. In 1950, I was rated as a "first-class worker in performance appraisal" in my organization, and in May of this year, I was selected as an outstanding member of the organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In order to live up to the leadership's cultivation of me and the comrades' expectations of me, I will work harder in the accounting work in the future to welcome the arrival of the upsurge of national economic construction. Yang Houji
Work hard to make up for past mistakes
Editor: I would like to talk about the transformation of my own ideological understanding.
When the "Three Antis" movement began, I was a young man who had been working as a purchasing agent for more than five months. At that time, because of my poor political study, I failed to draw a clear line between ideological boundaries, and my class position was not stable, so that in this short period of work, I was corrupted by bourgeois ideology, and I embezzled more than 600,000 yuan in Renminbi. After the start of the "Three Antis" movement, I had many ideological concerns and did not dare to face my mistakes squarely. After the leaders' painstaking education and the comrades' enthusiastic help, I thoroughly confessed my problems. Although the Party and the people were lenient in their handling of me, I, like Ma Jingwu, had a wrong understanding of economic work. I always thought: "This time I am finished, the leadership and the masses will no longer believe me." I even thought that my fiancée would not love me anymore. At that time, my thoughts were very confused, and I once planned to return to my original department to do typesetting work and no longer be a purchasing agent. I was also very afraid of approaching the masses, and even more unwilling to approach the leading cadres. Whenever I saw the old comrades who used to work together, I would blush and could not lift my head.
What is the truth? My thoughts were completely wrong. The leadership is forgiving and trusting of comrades who have truly recognized their mistakes and are determined to correct them. Now I have been transferred from the General Affairs Section to the basic construction work post and am shouldering a more arduous task, and the comrades are just as enthusiastic about me. My lover cares about me more than before. She often writes to encourage me to better serve the Party and the people in order to make up for the losses I have caused to the people in the past. From my own practical experience, I have deeply realized that the Party's concern for revolutionary comrades is meticulous. After the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, I have further raised my class consciousness and drawn a clear line between ideological boundaries. I must stand firm and never repeat my mistakes. I will honestly and wholeheartedly do economic work well. The motherland's various construction undertakings are developing rapidly. For the sake of the motherland, that is, for myself, I should bravely accept all the glorious tasks assigned to me by the people of the motherland. Shi DeKui
This is my contribution to the revolution
Editor: I am responsible for general affairs in a guest house of an organization. Because I can do my work with an active and responsible spirit, and always think from the interests of the country and the people, in more than a year, the general affairs work of the guest house has been improved, and many expenses have been saved for the country. In May of this year, I was rated as an outstanding member of the organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
When I was first transferred to work in the guest house, I found that whenever the purchasing agent bought coal back, some public servants would rather be idle than carry coal, but instead wanted the public to spend money to hire people to unload the coal. I really couldn't stand this phenomenon of not loving labor and wasting public property. On the one hand, I mobilized the public servant comrades, and on the other hand, I took the lead with practical actions, and finally motivated the comrades to actively participate in the work of carrying coal. From then on, we didn't need to hire people to carry coal in this guest house. Carrying coal does not affect the work and rest of public servants. I suggested to the leadership that other guest houses in our organization should also unload coal by themselves. The leadership adopted my suggestion and universally stopped the phenomenon of hiring people to carry coal. Over the past year, at least more than 3.87 million yuan of coal carrying fees have been saved. The more important gain is the education of public servants to love labor and work actively.
In the past, the water pipes and electric lights in the guest house often broke, and it cost a lot of money to find workers to repair them every time. I thought: "I must learn to repair water pipes and electric lights. If I can repair them myself, I can save a lot of expenses for the public." So when the workers came to repair them, I paid attention to learning, and soon I learned general repair techniques. When I was transferred to another guest house, I found that the actual water consumption of this guest house was not more than other places, but the monthly water bill was three times more than other places. In order to find out the reason for the water waste, I carefully checked everywhere, and found that there were leaking holes in the water pipes near the bathroom, toilet, and underground water meter. After plugging them, more than 90 tons of water expenses were saved every month.
The reason why I can happily work hard and do general affairs work well is due to the Party and the League's cultivation and education of me. I realize that my responsibility is to solve the problem of food and accommodation for the comrades, so that the comrades are healthy and can work energetically. This is my contribution to the revolution. Therefore, in my work, I do not care about personal reputation and status. I understand that as long as the revolution develops, I will also have a future. Chen Yongxiang

The Jinjia Lane slum nursery in Shanghai solves difficulties for the working people
Editor: Most of the residents in the Jinjia Lane slum area in Shanghai are tricycle riders, garbage collectors, and small business people. Their children have no one to take care of them and often run around in the streets. Parents with children cannot work with peace of mind because of this. The Shanghai Women's Federation, based on the needs of the local people, established a nursery in the Jinjia Lane slum area on May 1st, 1951, International Labor Day.
When the nursery was first established, the staff patiently visited the masses' homes, conducted persuasion and education again and again, aiming at their ideological concerns, so that they regarded the nursery as a part of their own family.
The Jinjia Lane slum nursery has encountered many difficulties in its work. At first, the children in the nursery cried all day long. The staff patiently took care of them, told them stories, and drew pictures for them. In this way, the children gradually got used to collective life. However, the parents still had many concerns. They worried that the staff would damage the children's eyes by washing their faces. The staff let the children take a nap, and the parents were afraid that the children would catch a cold. The staff did hard work and kept visiting the children's homes, and finally gained the trust of the parents.
The work of the nursery staff is very hard. They often have to leave the nursery until five or six o'clock in the afternoon, after the children have been completely picked up by their parents. They live far away from the nursery and often have to walk back and forth. Their lunch is brought from home. Even so, their enthusiasm for work has not been affected. They not only love the children, but also take on the work of educating the parents. At the twice-monthly mothers' meetings, and when the mothers pick up and drop off their children every day, they often advise the parents not to beat or scold their children and to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene.
Under the patient education of the staff, the children all understand many things. Yang Hongxi, a six-year-old child, said after hearing the story about the Communist Party: "This desk and this chair were given to us by Chairman Mao." The children all know how to cherish public property. They often say: "This thing was given to us by Chairman Mao, we can't break it!"

    应该怎样正确地对待经济工作？
    编者按：本栏今天所发表的“应该怎样正确地对待经济工作”的读者来信说明：经济工作人员只要能站稳立场和忠于革命事业，就可以不受资产阶级思想的腐蚀，不被奸商拉下水；而做好一切总务和技术工作都是对革命有益的，都会受到群众的崇敬和组织的表扬。
    我们将于下周发表一些读者来信中有关对经济工作人员培养和教育的意见。我们希望做经济工作的同志们从切身的体验中提出积极性的建议和要求，同时也希望各级党委和行政负责同志提出系统的意见。全国规模的经济建设高潮即将来到，对经济工作人员的培养和教育问题，应该是当前的重要问题之一，希望大家重视这个问题的讨论，积极提出建设性的意见。
    把全部会计工作担负起来
    编辑同志：我是一个青年团员。我在机关里做会计工作已经两年多了。一九五○年四月，我刚被调到这个工作岗位上不久，原来的两个会计同志一个去养病，一个调离机关，全部会计工作由我一个人来负担。当时我的思想很矛盾，一方面是害怕担不起这个繁重的任务，因为我过去学的是旧式会计，对新式簿记不熟习；另方面我又想起了党和团的教育，革命青年决不能向困难低头。经过激烈的思想斗争，我决心努力学习，克服困难完成党所分配的任务。于是我安下心来了，在领导干部和同志们帮助下，很快学会了新式会计，负担起总务科的全部会计工作。
    后来，机关精简工作人员，要求在职干部进一步提高工作效率，增加工作任务。我除了做会计工作以外，还要负担机关经费、事业费、采买、保管及审计等工作。在人少工作多的情况下，我知道只有改进工作方法，才能完成任务。于是我开动脑筋研究工作，比如：过去我们机关里发津贴费的手续非常繁杂，各种津贴费用分次领取，发一次津贴费需要八小时，因而使会计工作人员很忙乱，又容易出错误，领津贴的同志也不方便。经过研究，我制成了一种补发津贴明细表，把每个人所领的各种津贴完全填入到一个表格里，算清每人净领款数，一次领取，这样，只需三小时就可以全部发完，比以前节省了五个小时。
    接着，我又制出了机关经费收支情况比较表，把每月的经费收支情况统计在一个表格内，从每月的累计数字，可以看出机关全部的经费收支情况，每当呈报预算收支情况时，就不必临时统计了。此外，我还制出了固定财产家具统计表、房屋统计表等，对简化工作手续，节省工作时间，消灭错误等方面，都起了一定的作用。
    两年来，我从切身的体验中懂得了一个真理；不论任何工作，只要能深入，都可以找到“道理”和“学问”，都可以有创造和改进，但关键在于是否忠于革命事业，是否开动了脑筋。虽然我为人民所作的事还很少很少，但领导方面却不断地给我以鼓励，一九五○年我被评为本机关“甲等考绩工作者”，今年五月又被评选为中共中央直属机关的优秀团员。为了不辜负领导方面对我的培养和同志们对我的希望，今后我要更努力地做好会计工作，以迎接国家经济建设高潮的到来。杨厚吉
    努力工作弥补以往的过错
    编辑同志：我想来谈谈我自己思想认识的转变。
    “三反”运动开始时，我是一个做了五个多月采购工作的青年。当时由于自己政治学习差，没能划清思想界限，阶级立场站得不稳，以致在这短短的工作期间内，就被资产阶级的思想腐蚀了，我贪污了人民币六十多万元。“三反”运动开始以后，自己思想顾虑很多，没敢正视自己的错误。经过领导同志苦口婆心地教育和同志们的热心帮助，我才彻底交代了问题。虽然党和人民对我的处理是宽大的，可是我却和马竞武一样，产生了对经济工作的错误的认识。我总认为：“这回我可是完了，领导方面和群众再也不会相信我了。”甚至我想到，我的未婚妻也不会爱我了。当时自己的思想很混乱，曾经打算回原部门做排字工作，不再当采购员了。自己也很怕接近群众，更不愿接近领导干部，一见到过去在一起工作的老同志就面红耳赤，抬不起头来。
    事实怎样呢？我的想法完全错了。领导方面对于真正认识了错误并决心改正错误的同志是原谅的，信任的。现在我由总务科调到基本建设工作岗位上，担负更繁重的任务了，同志们对我同样亲热。我的爱人对我比以前更关心，她经常来信鼓励我，叫我更好地为党为人民服务，以弥补我过去给人民所造成的损失。我从自己的实际体验中，深深认识到党对革命同志的关怀是无微不至的。经过“三反”和“五反”运动，我进一步提高了阶级觉悟，划清了思想界限，我一定要站稳立场，决不重犯错误。我要老老实实地，忠心耿耿地做好经济工作。祖国的各种建设事业正在飞速发展，为了祖国，也就是为了自己，我应该勇敢地接受祖国人民交给我的一切光荣任务。　史德奎
    这就是我对革命的贡献
    编辑同志：我在一个机关的招待所里负责总务工作。因为我能以主动负责的精神做工作，处处从国家和人民的利益着想，在一年多的时间里，使招待所的总务工作有了改进，并为国家节省了许多开支。在今年五月间，我被评为中共中央直属机关的优秀团员。
    当我起初被调到招待所工作时，我发现每当采买员把煤买回来时，有些公务员宁可闲着也不愿去抬煤，反而要公家化钱雇人卸煤。对这种不爱劳动和浪费公家财产的现象我实在看不惯。我一面动员公务员同志，一面用实际行动来带头，终于带动了同志们踊跃参加抬煤的工作。从此以后，我们这个招待所里就不用雇人抬煤了。抬煤并不影响公务员的工作和休息。我向领导方面建议，我们机关的其他招待所也应该自己卸煤。领导方面采纳了我的建议，普遍停止了雇人抬煤的现象。一年来至少节约抬煤费三百八十七万多元。更主要的收获，是教育了公务员们热爱劳动和积极工作。
    过去招待所里的水管、电灯常坏，找工人来修理，每次都要化很多钱。我就想：“我一定要学会修理水管和电灯。如果我自己能修理，可以给公家节省很多开支。”于是当工人来修理时，我就留心学习，不久，果然学会了一般的修理技术。当我调到另一个招待所工作时，发现这个招待所的实际用水量并不比别处多，可是每月的水费却比别处多三倍。我为了找出费水的原因，到处细心地检查，结果发现在澡房、厕所及地下水表附近的水管有漏水的洞口，堵塞后，每月节省了九十多吨水的开支。
    我所以能愉快地努力做好总务工作，是由于党和团对我的培养和教育。我认识到我的责任就在于解决同志们的食宿问题，使同志们身体健康，能够精力充沛地去做工作，这就是我对革命的贡献。因而在工作中，我不计较个人的名誉和地位，我懂得：只要革命有了发展，我也就有了前途。

    上海金家巷棚户区托儿站给劳动人民解决了困难
    编辑同志：上海金家巷棚户区的居民，大半是蹬三轮车、拾垃圾和做小生意的。他们的孩子没有人照顾，常常在马路上乱跑。有孩子的父母因此不能安心工作。上海家庭妇女联合会根据当地人民的需要，在一九五一年“五一”国际劳动节那天，在金家巷棚户区建立了一个托儿站。
    托儿站刚建立时，工作人员就耐心地到群众家里去访问，针对他们的思想顾虑，一次又一次地进行说服教育，使他们把托儿站看作自己家庭的一部分。
    金家巷棚户区托儿站在工作中曾经遇到不少困难。起初，托儿站的孩子整天哭哭啼啼，工作人员耐心地照顾他们，讲故事给他们听，画图画给他们看。这样，孩子们便渐渐地习惯于集体生活了。但是家长们的顾虑仍然是很多的。她们担心工作人员给孩子们洗脸，会擦坏孩子的眼睛。工作人员让孩子们午睡，家长们又怕孩子着凉。工作人员进行了艰苦的工作，又不断到孩子的家中访问，终于取得了家长的信任。
    托儿站工作人员的工作是很辛苦的，她们往往要到下午五、六点钟，孩子完全被家长接回以后，才能离开托儿站。她们住的地方离托儿站很远，常常要徒步往来。她们的午饭都是从家里带来的。虽然这样，她们的工作热情并没有受到影响。她们不但爱护孩子，同时还担负起教育家长的工作，在每月两次的妈妈会上，在妈妈们每天接送孩子的时候，她们常常劝告家长，不要打骂孩子，注意清洁卫生。
    孩子们在工作人员的耐心教育下，都懂得许多事情了。六岁的孩子杨鸿禧听了关于共产党的故事以后，就说：“这书桌、这椅子，都是毛主席送给我们的。”孩子们都知道爱惜公家的财产了，他们常说：“这东西是毛主席给我们的，不能弄坏呀！”
