Reader's Letters
How should we correctly treat economic work?
Editor's Note: The reader's letter "How should we correctly treat economic work" published in this column today illustrates that economic workers, as long as they stand firm and are loyal to the revolutionary cause, can be immune to the corruption of bourgeois ideology and avoid being dragged down by unscrupulous merchants. Doing all logistical and technical work is beneficial to the revolution and will be respected by the masses and commended by the organization.
We will publish some readers' letters next week with opinions on the cultivation and education of economic workers. We hope that comrades engaged in economic work will put forward active suggestions and requirements from their personal experiences, and we also hope that Party committees and administrative leaders at all levels will put forward systematic opinions. The upsurge of national economic construction is about to arrive, and the cultivation and education of economic workers should be one of the important issues at present. We hope that everyone will pay attention to the discussion of this issue and actively put forward constructive opinions.
Shouldering all accounting work
Editor: I am a member of the Communist Youth League. I have been doing accounting work in the organization for more than two years. In April 1950, shortly after I was transferred to this position, the original two accounting comrades, one went to recuperate and the other was transferred away from the organization, and all accounting work was borne by me alone. At that time, my thoughts were very contradictory. On the one hand, I was afraid that I could not bear this heavy task, because I had learned old-style accounting in the past and was not familiar with new-style bookkeeping; on the other hand, I thought of the education of the Party and the League, and revolutionary youths must never bow to difficulties. After a fierce ideological struggle, I decided to study hard, overcome difficulties, and complete the task assigned by the Party. So I calmed down and, with the help of leading cadres and comrades, quickly learned new-style accounting and took on all the accounting work of the General Affairs Section.
Later, the organization streamlined its staff and required cadres to further improve work efficiency and increase work tasks. In addition to doing accounting work, I also had to take on the organization's funds, operating expenses, purchasing, storage, and auditing work. In the case of fewer people and more work, I knew that only by improving work methods could I complete the task. So I used my brain to study the work. For example, in the past, the procedures for issuing subsidies in our organization were very complicated. Various subsidies were collected in installments, and it took eight hours to issue one subsidy, which made the accounting staff very busy and prone to errors, and it was also inconvenient for the comrades who received the subsidies. After research, I made a detailed supplementary subsidy form, filled in all kinds of subsidies received by each person into a form, calculated the net amount received by each person, and collected it at one time. In this way, it only took three hours to complete the issuance, saving five hours compared to before.
Next, I made a comparative table of income and expenditure of the organization's funds, and compiled the monthly income and expenditure in a table. From the cumulative figures of each month, you can see the entire income and expenditure of the organization's funds, and you don't have to do temporary statistics every time you report the budget income and expenditure. In addition, I also made a statistical table of fixed property furniture, a statistical table of houses, etc., which played a certain role in simplifying work procedures, saving work time, and eliminating errors.
In the past two years, I have learned a truth from my personal experience: no matter what kind of work, as long as you go deep, you can find "principles" and "knowledge," and you can have creation and improvement, but the key lies in whether you are loyal to the revolutionary cause and whether you have used your brain. Although I have done very little for the people, the leadership has constantly given me encouragement. In 1950, I was rated as a "first-class worker in performance appraisal" in my organization, and in May of this year, I was selected as an outstanding member of the organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In order to live up to the leadership's cultivation of me and the comrades' expectations of me, I will work harder in the accounting work in the future to welcome the arrival of the upsurge of national economic construction.

Work hard to make up for past mistakes
Editor: I would like to talk about the transformation of my own ideological understanding.
When the "Three Antis" movement began, I was a young man who had been working as a purchasing agent for more than five months. At that time, because of my poor political study, I failed to draw a clear line between ideological boundaries, and my class position was not stable, so that in this short period of work, I was corrupted by bourgeois ideology, and I embezzled more than 600,000 yuan in Renminbi. After the start of the "Three Antis" movement, I had many ideological concerns and did not dare to face my mistakes squarely. After the leaders' painstaking education and the comrades' enthusiastic help, I thoroughly confessed my problems. Although the Party and the people were lenient in their handling of me, I, like Ma Jingwu, had a wrong understanding of economic work. I always thought: "This time I am finished, the leadership and the masses will no longer believe me." I even thought that my fianc√©e would not love me anymore. At that time, my thoughts were very confused, and I once planned to return to my original department to do typesetting work and no longer be a purchasing agent. I was also very afraid of approaching the masses, and even more unwilling to approach the leading cadres. Whenever I saw the old comrades who used to work together, I would blush and could not lift my head.
What is the truth? My thoughts were completely wrong. The leadership is forgiving and trusting of comrades who have truly recognized their mistakes and are determined to correct them. Now I have been transferred from the General Affairs Section to the basic construction work post and am shouldering a more arduous task, and the comrades are just as enthusiastic about me. My lover cares about me more than before. She often writes to encourage me to better serve the Party and the people in order to make up for the losses I have caused to the people in the past. From my own practical experience, I have deeply realized that the Party's concern for revolutionary comrades is meticulous. After the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, I have further raised my class consciousness and drawn a clear line between ideological boundaries. I must stand firm and never repeat my mistakes. I will honestly and wholeheartedly do economic work well. The motherland's various construction undertakings are developing rapidly. For the sake of the motherland, that is, for myself, I should bravely accept all the glorious tasks assigned to me by the people of the motherland. Shi DeKui
This is my contribution to the revolution
Editor: I am responsible for general affairs in a guest house of an organization. Because I can do my work with an active and responsible spirit, and always think from the interests of the country and the people, in more than a year, the general affairs work of the guest house has been improved, and many expenses have been saved for the country. In May of this year, I was rated as an outstanding member of the organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
When I was first transferred to work in the guest house, I found that whenever the purchasing agent bought coal back, some public servants would rather be idle than carry coal, but instead wanted the public to spend money to hire people to unload the coal. I really couldn't stand this phenomenon of not loving labor and wasting public property. On the one hand, I mobilized the public servant comrades, and on the other hand, I took the lead with practical actions, and finally motivated the comrades to actively participate in the work of carrying coal. From then on, we didn't need to hire people to carry coal in this guest house. Carrying coal does not affect the work and rest of public servants. I suggested to the leadership that other guest houses in our organization should also unload coal by themselves. The leadership adopted my suggestion and universally stopped the phenomenon of hiring people to carry coal. Over the past year, at least more than 3.87 million yuan of coal carrying fees have been saved. The more important gain is the education of public servants to love labor and work actively.
In the past, the water pipes and electric lights in the guest house often broke, and it cost a lot of money to find workers to repair them every time. I thought: "I must learn to repair water pipes and electric lights. If I can repair them myself, I can save a lot of expenses for the public." So when the workers came to repair them, I paid attention to learning, and soon I learned general repair techniques. When I was transferred to another guest house, I found that the actual water consumption of this guest house was not more than other places, but the monthly water bill was three times more than other places. In order to find out the reason for the water waste, I carefully checked everywhere, and found that there were leaking holes in the water pipes near the bathroom, toilet, and underground water meter. After plugging them, more than 90 tons of water expenses were saved every month.
The reason why I can happily work hard and do general affairs work well is due to the Party and the League's cultivation and education of me. I realize that my responsibility is to solve the problem of food and accommodation for the comrades, so that the comrades are healthy and can work energetically. This is my contribution to the revolution. Therefore, in my work, I do not care about personal reputation and status. I understand that as long as the revolution develops, I will also have a future.

The Jinjia Lane slum nursery in Shanghai solves difficulties for the working people
Editor: Most of the residents in the Jinjia Lane slum area in Shanghai are tricycle riders, garbage collectors, and small business people. Their children have no one to take care of them and often run around in the streets. Parents with children cannot work with peace of mind because of this. The Shanghai Women's Federation, based on the needs of the local people, established a nursery in the Jinjia Lane slum area on May 1st, 1951, International Labor Day.
When the nursery was first established, the staff patiently visited the masses' homes, conducted persuasion and education again and again, aiming at their ideological concerns, so that they regarded the nursery as a part of their own family.
The Jinjia Lane slum nursery has encountered many difficulties in its work. At first, the children in the nursery cried all day long. The staff patiently took care of them, told them stories, and drew pictures for them. In this way, the children gradually got used to collective life. However, the parents still had many concerns. They worried that the staff would damage the children's eyes by washing their faces. The staff let the children take a nap, and the parents were afraid that the children would catch a cold. The staff did hard work and kept visiting the children's homes, and finally gained the trust of the parents.
The work of the nursery staff is very hard. They often have to leave the nursery until five or six o'clock in the afternoon, after the children have been completely picked up by their parents. They live far away from the nursery and often have to walk back and forth. Their lunch is brought from home. Even so, their enthusiasm for work has not been affected. They not only love the children, but also take on the work of educating the parents. At the twice-monthly mothers' meetings, and when the mothers pick up and drop off their children every day, they often advise the parents not to beat or scold their children and to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene.
Under the patient education of the staff, the children all understand many things. Yang Hongxi, a six-year-old child, said after hearing the story about the Communist Party: "This desk and this chair were given to us by Chairman Mao." The children all know how to cherish public property. They often say: "This thing was given to us by Chairman Mao, we can't break it!"
