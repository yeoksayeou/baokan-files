Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 27th: In the five days of fighting from the 21st to the 25th, the Korean and Chinese forces continued to inflict casualties on the enemy through blocking, counterattacking, and ambushing.

On the 21st, the American invading army attacked a high ground northwest of Kimhwa with two companies. Our army immediately bombarded them with artillery fire and launched a counter-offensive, repelling the enemy and killing or wounding more than 120 enemy soldiers. On the 22nd, the American invading army, with a battalion's strength, once again fiercely attacked an unnamed high ground northeast of Shangpu-dong, west of Tieyuan. This high ground had been retaken by our army in a counterattack on the 17th, and the enemy had counterattacked many times, but they were all defeated. This time, the American invading army attacked from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM. Under the heroic resistance of our army, the enemy suffered more than 140 casualties and retreated in defeat. On the same day, on the eastern front, a capable small unit of our army completely annihilated an enemy platoon in an ambush northwest of Sashari. On the same night, two enemy companies attacked a high ground west of Mundeung-ri and were repelled by our defending forces. The enemy, while retreating, was attacked by our ambush troops, resulting in over 30 enemy soldiers being killed or wounded. On the 24th, our army counterattacked an enemy position west of Tieyuan, completely annihilating the defending enemy platoon and repelling three enemy counterattacks, killing or wounding more than 80 enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 25th, the American invading army again attacked an area northwest of Kimhwa with two companies, suffering a sudden and concentrated fire attack from our ambush troops, resulting in 138 enemy soldiers being killed or wounded. In this battle, only one soldier from our army was injured.

Our front-line troops continue to use various firearms for anti-aircraft fire. According to very incomplete statistics, in the four days from the 21st to the 24th, our army shot down or damaged a total of 37 enemy aircraft, including 30 fighter planes and 4 artillery spotting planes.
