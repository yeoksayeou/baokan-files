    India and Other Countries Refuse to Investigate POW Camps
    Truman's Deception Utterly Bankrupt

    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch] U.S. President Truman's so-called "invitation" to neutral nations to send military observers to investigate the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camps has now been declared a complete failure, following the refusal by the governments of India and Indonesia, among others.

    According to a Washington dispatch on the 17th from the U.S. International News Service: "As the American proposal gradually falls apart, well-informed sources in the State Department now believe that the U.S. government has no reason to continue demanding an investigation into the situation on Koje Island."

    Truman proposed on June 11th to invite India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sweden, and Switzerland to investigate the Koje Island POW camps. The aim of this American deception was to use these countries to cover up its criminal acts on Koje Island and thereby undermine the friendship between these countries and the Chinese and Korean people. However, the American plot did not achieve its purpose. According to a Washington dispatch on the 10th from the U.S. News Service: A U.S. State Department spokesman said that India and Indonesia "have expressed their unwillingness to participate in the committee." The U.S. government, in order to achieve its goals, had used divisive and deceptive tactics. Washington had repeatedly spread rumors that Sweden "had notified the U.S. government" that it would participate in the investigation team if the three Asian countries invited were also willing to participate. However, Swedish officials quickly denied this rumor. According to a Stockholm dispatch on the 11th from Reuters: "Sweden today denied the American news report that Sweden had agreed to participate if Pakistan, India, and Indonesia agreed to participate in the proposed neutral nations' commission to investigate United Nations prisoner-of-war camps."

    In order to cover up the shameful failure of this American deception, U.S. State Department officials emphasized that "the rejection of the informal proposal made by the United States should not be seen as a blow to the United States." The State Department official shamelessly said, "The United States made this proposal only to explore the five countries' opinions on conducting a fair investigation."

### 印度等国拒绝调查战俘营  杜鲁门骗局彻底破产

    印度等国拒绝调查战俘营
    杜鲁门骗局彻底破产
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国总统杜鲁门提出的所谓“邀请”中立国派遣军事观察员调查巨济岛战俘营的阴谋计划，在遭到印度和印尼等国政府的拒绝之后，现已宣告彻底破产。
    据美国国际新闻社华盛顿十七日电称：“由于美国的建议逐渐瓦解，国务院的消息灵通人士现在认为：美国政府没有理由继续要求调查巨济岛的情况了。”
    杜鲁门邀请印度、印尼、巴基斯坦、瑞典、瑞士五国调查巨济岛战俘营，是在六月十一日提出的。美国的这个骗局的目的，是企图利用这些国家来替它掩盖在巨济岛的罪恶行为，并借以破坏这些国家与中朝人民的友谊。但是，美国的阴谋计划并没有达到目的。据美国新闻处华盛顿十日电称：美国国务院发言人说，印度和印尼“已表示不愿参加该委员会”。美国政府为了要达到目的，曾经使用各个击破的欺骗手段。华盛顿曾一再放出谣言说：瑞典“已经通知美国政府”说，假如被邀请的三个亚洲国家也愿意参加的话，它就参加调查团的工作。但是，瑞典官方很快就否认了这个谣言。据路透社斯德哥尔摩十一日电称：“瑞典今天否认美国消息所称瑞典已经同意假如巴基斯坦、印度和印度尼西亚同意参加建议中的中立国调查联合国战俘营委员会时，瑞典也将参加的消息。”
    为了掩饰美国的这个骗局的可耻失败，美国国务院官员强调说：“不应把拒绝美国提出的非正式建议的行为看做对美国的打击”。该国务院官员不知羞耻地说：“美国提出这个建议原只是为了探听五国对于进行公平的调查的意见”而已。
