	The Patriotic Production Increase Competition Should Not Simply Compare Crops
	To the Editor: The Patriotic Production Increase Competition recently carried out in Guangfu Township, Eleventh District, Zhongjiang County, Northern Sichuan, only compared crops and neglected the patriotic content. As a result, many village and township cadres were discouraged and expressed their unwillingness to continue their mass work to the masses. Xu Jianmin, the representative director of Wanfu Second Village, is a young member of the Communist Youth League and is very active in his work. He participated in the district's rice production increase competition. He had to spend some of his time on mass work, so he put less effort into his crops, which grew relatively poorly. He lost the competition, and his mass work was not evaluated. Therefore, he resigned from his position to the masses, asking to go home and concentrate on production.
	After learning about this, the district's leading organs immediately conducted an in-depth inspection and discovered similar situations in other townships, and then corrected them. At an enlarged cadre meeting in Guangfu Township, the content of the second competition was improved: first, compare patriotism; second, compare crops; third, compare technology; fourth, compare unity; fifth, compare leading the masses. As a result, more than 5,400 out of the entire township's 6,000 people participated in the production increase competition. Village and township cadres who originally wanted to change shifts and quit are now working very actively. Huang Kai

    爱国增产评比运动不应该单纯比庄稼
    编辑同志：川北中江县十一区广福乡不久以前开展了爱国增产评比运动，这次评比只是单纯比庄稼，忽视了比爱国的内容。好些村、乡干部因此垂头丧气，向群众表示不愿担任群众工作了。万福二村代表主任许建民是个青年团员，工作很积极，参加了区的水稻增产竞赛。他要用部分时间搞群众工作，在庄稼上用的功夫少了一些，庄稼长得比较差一点。这次评比输了，而对于他的群众工作却没有加以评比。因此他向群众辞职，要求回家埋头生产。
    区的领导机关知道以后，立即进行深入检查，发现其他乡也有类似情况，便进行纠正。广福乡在扩大干部会议上，改进了第二次评比内容：第一比爱国，第二比庄稼，第三比技术，第四比团结，第五比带动群众。这一来，全乡六千多人，就有五千四百人参加增产竞赛。原来想换班不干的村、乡干部，现在干得非常积极了。黄恺
