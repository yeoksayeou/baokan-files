Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The "Appeal to All Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare," passed by the Standing Committee at the Oslo meeting this April, was approved by the World Peace Council at its special session in Berlin as follows:

    After carefully studying the documents relating to the germ warfare currently being waged in China and Korea, we are deeply concerned and shocked. Germ warfare is not only an abhorrent crime that must be stopped, but also a threat to all mankind. We appeal to the conscience of all men and women in the world, calling on them to demand the cessation of germ warfare and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. We appeal first to the men and women of America, because each of them is faced with a question of integrity and character. The war in Korea is being waged under the name of the United Nations, which is a particularly serious situation; we believe that those governments that have approved of the United Nations' intervention and are therefore morally and politically responsible for the methods used in the war must be held accountable for this situation. As for us, we have a double obligation: first, to report the situation to public opinion and to tell everyone the truth, so that everyone can judge the ugly facts that we already know. We have decided to publish the documents we have in hand, and the crimes must be brought to light. In order to bring these crimes to light, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression has proposed the establishment of an international committee capable of collecting all the facts. The authority and impartiality of this committee should be beyond dispute. To establish this committee, we are inviting the most prestigious representatives from the scientific, legal, and religious communities to participate. We are confident that world opinion will support the efforts of this committee. Our second obligation is to protect all peoples from the scourge of germ warfare. We believe that only the United States, the only major power, has not ratified the International Convention of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons. We call on the people of the world to put pressure on their governments so that all countries, without exception, sign, ratify and abide by this convention. At the same time, we demand that strong action be taken to bring those criminals who use the most vile, obscene, and horrific weapons to justice as war criminals. We are confident that our demand to protect the innocent and punish the guilty represents the opinion of the vast majority of people. We represent them in defending the noblest cause—the right of all children to survive and respect for humanity. If the people of all countries do not act immediately to stop germ warfare, then there will be no end to the cruel frenzy of destructive forces. We call on mankind to rise up and defend itself.

    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议批准
    “反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书
    【新华社二十七日讯】世界和平理事会柏林特别会议批准的常务委员会今年四月奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书如下：
    我们仔细地研讨了有关目前在中国和朝鲜进行的细菌战的文件以后，深感焦虑和震惊。细菌战不仅是应该予以制止的丑恶罪行，而且是对全人类的威胁。我们向全世界男女的良心呼吁，号召他们要求制止细菌战和禁止细菌武器。我们首先向美国的男女呼吁，因为他们每个人的面前都出现了一个正直与否和品格如何的问题。朝鲜战争之用联合国名义进行，是一种特别严重的情况；我们认为：那些赞成联合国进行干涉因而对进行战争所使用的方法负有道义和政治责任的政府，应对这种情况负责。至于我们，则负有双重义务：首先便是向舆论界报告情况，并把真相告诉每一个人，使人人都能判断我们已经晓得的丑恶事实。我们决定公布我们现有的文件，必须使罪行大白于天下。为了使这些罪行大白于天下，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会建议成立一个能够收集一切事实的国际委员会。这个委员会的权威性和公正性应该是无可争辩的。为了建立这个委员会，我们请科学界、法律界和宗教界最有威望的代表参加。我们确信世界舆论必将支持这个委员会的努力。我们的第二个义务就是保卫所有的人民，使免于细菌战的浩劫。我们认为：只有美国，也就是大国中唯一的国家，才没有批准一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的国际公约。我们要求全世界人民对本国的政府施加压力，以使所有国家都毫无例外地签署、批准并遵守这个公约。我们同时要求采取强有力的行动，把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。我们确信，我们提出保护无辜者而惩办罪犯的要求，是代表着绝大多数人的意见的。我们代表他们捍卫最崇高的事业——一切儿童生存的权利以及对人性的尊重。如果各国人民不立即行动起来制止细菌战，那么，破坏力量的残酷狂暴是没有止境的。我们号召人类起来自卫。
