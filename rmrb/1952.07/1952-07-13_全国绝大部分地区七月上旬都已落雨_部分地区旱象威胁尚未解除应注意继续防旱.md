Most parts of the country received rainfall in early July. The rainfall distribution was uneven, with some areas in the Northeast, parts of North China, most of Shandong, and many areas south of the Yangtze River still feeling insufficient rainfall. In Henan, heavy rains caused mountain floods, and the tributaries of the Huai River and the Bai River, a tributary of the Han River, rose sharply. The current period is a tense time for preventing drought while also paying attention to flood prevention and waterlogging prevention.

In June, the climate was imbalanced, and the monthly rainfall in some parts of the country was lower than the average rainfall in previous years. Among them, the rainfall in Liaoxi Province and southwestern Jilin Province in the Northeast, Beijing, Baoding, Tanggu, GuiSui and other places in North China, most areas in the Central and Southern District, most areas in the East China District, and southern Sichuan and northern Guizhou Province in the Southwest District, was less than half of the average rainfall in June in previous years. The rainfall in Wuhu, Nanjing, and surrounding areas was less than a quarter of the average rainfall in June in previous years. In early and mid-June, areas north and south of the Huai River, Henan, Shandong, the North China Region, and the Northwest Region were very dry, so that late autumn crops could not be sown after the wheat harvest, and the situation was very serious. At that time, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued an emergency instruction on drought resistance, and the local people's governments had led the peasants to resist drought and sow seeds. From June 25th to 28th, there was widespread heavy rain east of the Huai River and east of Tianshui in Gansu. These areas became the areas where the rainfall in June this year was more than the average rainfall in June in previous years. Before the rain, these areas had already made great achievements in drought-resistant sowing. Half of the summer fields in Henan had been planted, and the summer fields in Laiyang and Wendeng special districts in Shandong had been completely planted. Two-thirds of the summer fields in Tengxian Special District had been planted, and 6.5 million mu of summer fields had been planted in Pingyuan Province. After the rain, various places led the peasants to seize the opportunity to plant while the soil was moist. Now, except for a few low-lying areas that need to drain accumulated water, the sowing of late autumn crops has been completed. The area of summer fields in these areas accounts for a quarter of the total cultivated land in small areas and two-thirds in large areas. Therefore, completing the summer sowing is an important guarantee for striving for a good autumn harvest.

In early July, there was no serious drought in various parts of the country. Some places had one rainfall, and some places had two or three rainfalls. The largest rainfall was in northern Jiangsu, northern Sichuan, southern Shaanxi, eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan around Chengdu, and the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. The rainfall in these places was all above 50 to 100 millimeters. Huaiyin had more than 150 millimeters, Chengdu had more than 100 millimeters, Hanzhong had 95 millimeters, and Guangzhou had 59 millimeters. The second largest was the Huai River Basin, Henan, Anhui, and the Dabie Mountain area of Hubei, with rainfall of about 50 millimeters. Most of Hebei Province in North China, northern Pingyuan Province, southeastern Shanxi Province, and parts of southern Chahar and northern Yanbei also had rainfall of about 50 millimeters. South of the Yangtze River, only southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, northeastern Fujian, Nanchang in Jiangxi, Changsha and Yuanling in Hunan, Zhenyuan in Guizhou, and other places had rainfall exceeding 50 millimeters; most areas had only about 25 millimeters; eastern Guangdong, southern Fujian, central and southeastern Yunnan, and parts of Guizhou had rainfall of less than 10 millimeters. In the north, most of Shandong, part of Shanxi, and the banks of the Liao River in the Northeast had insufficient rainfall, and the threat of drought has not been lifted. The Hetao area of Suiyuan had no rain in early July and is the driest area in the country. The local people's government is leading the peasants to fight drought and protect seedlings.

    全国绝大部分地区七月上旬都已落雨
    部分地区旱象威胁尚未解除应注意继续防旱
    七月上旬，全国绝大部分地区都下了雨。雨量分布不均，东北部分地区、华北部分地区、山东大部地区和长江以南许多地区仍感雨量不足。河南各地因雨多山洪暴发，淮河各支流和汉水支流白河都曾猛烈上涨。当前正是防旱而同时又要注意防汛、防涝的紧张时期。
    六月份气候失调，全国部分地区全月降雨量低于历年平均雨量。其中东北的辽西省和吉林省西南部，华北的北京、保定、塘沽、归绥等地，中南区大部地区，华东区大部地区，西南区的川南和贵州省北部，降雨量不及历年六月平均雨量的一半。芜湖、南京一带降雨量不到历年六月平均雨量的四分之一。六月上旬和中旬，淮河南北、河南、山东、华北区和西北区都很干旱，以致小麦收割后晚秋作物无法播种，情况曾非常严重。当时中央人民政府政务院曾发布抗旱紧急指示，上述各地人民政府都已领导农民抗旱播种。六月二十五日到二十八日，淮河以东、甘肃天水以东普遍下了大雨。这些地区，就成了今年六月雨量多于历年六月雨量的地区。雨前这些地区抗旱播种就已有很大的成绩，河南的夏田已种了一半，山东莱阳专区和文登专区的夏田已种完，滕县专区的夏田已种了三分之二，平原省的夏田也已种了六百五十万亩。雨后各地又领导农民趁墒抢种，现在除个别低地须排除积水以外，晚秋作物的播种都已经完成了。这些地区的夏田面积，少的占耕地总面积的四分之一，多的占三分之二，因此完成夏播是争取秋季丰收的重要保证。
    七月上旬，全国各地还没有发生严重的旱象，有的地方下过一次雨，有的地方下过两三次。雨量最大的是苏北区、川北、陕南和川东、川西成都周围和广东珠江三角洲，这些地方的雨量都在五十公厘到一百公厘以上。淮阴为一百五十多公厘，成都为一百多公厘，汉中为九十五公厘，广州为五十九公厘。其次为淮河流域的河南、安徽和湖北大别山地区，雨量在五十公厘左右。华北的河北省大部、平原省北部、山西省东南部和察南、雁北的部分地区，雨量也在五十公厘左右。长江以南只有苏南，浙江，福建东北，江西南昌，湖南长沙、沅陵一带，贵州镇远等地，雨量超过了五十公厘；大部地区只有二十五公厘左右；粤东、闽南、云南中部和东南部、贵州部分地区，雨量不足十公厘。北方山东大部、山西一部、东北辽河两岸雨量不丰，旱象威胁还未解除。绥远河套地区七月上旬无雨，是全国最旱的地区。当地人民政府正领导农民抗旱保苗。    （新华社）
