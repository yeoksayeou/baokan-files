Correcting Two Deviations in the Propaganda of Promoting Agricultural Abundance Experiences

In the past six months, newspapers in various regions have generally paid attention to the summarization and promotion of agricultural abundance experiences. Some experiences, such as Qu Yaoli's cotton close planting experience, have become a model for the vast cotton farmers to unleash potential and increase yield per unit area through repeated publicity in newspapers. This is one aspect. However, on the other hand, some newspapers, in reporting on the promotion of certain agricultural abundance experiences, have failed to conduct correct and in-depth publicity based on the characteristics of agricultural production, and have instead developed tendencies of commandism and empiricism, divorced from reality and the masses.

The specific manifestation of commandism in the promotion of agricultural abundance experience publicity is forcing farmers to universally promote new farming methods. This is most prominently demonstrated by the "Sichuan West Daily". This spring, Sichuan West experienced a deviation of forcing the universal promotion of the "sparse planting" method for rice. Some township cadres, who did not even understand "sparse planting" themselves, forced farmers to implement "sparse planting," which caused dissatisfaction among farmers. Some counties even subjectively formulated county-wide "sparse planting" plans, forcing farmers to universally promote it. The "Sichuan West Daily" not only failed to criticize and correct this coercive practice in a timely manner, but instead blindly publicized and praised it on multiple occasions. For example, on May 8, in the news "Zhang Yushan Mutual Aid Group is Preparing for Rice Planting," it praised the coercive practice of "immediately changing the unqualified furrow ditches that had already been dug." On May 11, in the news "The People's Government of Guancang Township, Jintang County, Timely Publicizes and Promotes the Sparse Planting Method," it pointed out that among the fifty village cadres in the second village of Guancang Township, Jintang County, twenty-nine did not believe or were skeptical, while affirming that the township government had corrected "conservative thinking," and that "the vast majority" of more than seven hundred mu of early paddy fields had adopted the sparse planting method. This unrealistic publicity by the "Sichuan West Daily" only began to be corrected after the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Sichuan West People's Administrative Office issued "Instructions on Correcting Deviations Occurring in the Implementation of 'Sparse Planting'" on May 17. The reason for this deviation of forced universal promotion is obviously because the editors of these newspapers did not understand the policy of key experiments and did not master the basic knowledge of agricultural science and technology.

Of course, it is also very wrong to overemphasize the regional and special nature of agricultural technology and completely reject the publicity and introduction of advanced experiences from other places. Readers of the "Chongqing Xinhua Daily" once wrote letters requesting the newspaper to introduce abundance experiences from other parts of the country, such as Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience in Shanxi. However, the "Xinhua Daily" adopted a rejecting attitude, believing that "agricultural production is greatly restricted by regionality, and the experience of the north may not be applicable in the south." (See the newspaper's "Editor's Note" on March 23.) Therefore, the newspaper has never introduced agricultural abundance experiences from other places. There is no doubt that when promoting agricultural abundance experiences, not only can the experiences of the north not be mechanically applied to the south, but also the abundance experiences of a certain province, a certain county, or a certain farmer cannot be arbitrarily copied and misused. They must be promoted gradually with a focus on the degree of awareness and production conditions of local farmers. But does this mean that newspapers can therefore not critically introduce advanced experiences from other places that have been effectively implemented? Does this mean that the basic principles of these advanced experiences are also "not necessarily applicable"? Obviously not. Because, in fact, Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience in Shanxi was the result of adopting the advanced Soviet "sparse planting" experience; this experience is not "inapplicable" in the southwest, where there is more rain and a humid climate. The article "Summarizing the Abundance Experiences of Cotton Planting Models to Increase Cotton Yield per Unit Area," published by the Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Southwest Agricultural and Forestry Department in the "Chongqing Xinhua Daily" on April 15, negated this conservative view. The article stated that according to the advanced Soviet experience, as well as the abundance results of Qu Yaoli in Shanxi Province and the Shuangqiao State-owned Farm in Beijing, "cotton must be appropriately densely planted," and pointed out that in the southwest region, under certain conditions, "on the basis of the original number of plants per mu, the density should be appropriately increased, with 2,400 to 2,800 plants of upland cotton per mu being more appropriate." This shows that the "Chongqing Xinhua Daily's" attitude of refusing to introduce advanced experiences from other places is also, in reality, divorced from reality and the masses.

The above facts prove that both the deviation of coercion and commandism and the deviation of narrow empiricism are directly detrimental to the development of the agricultural abundance movement.

### 纠正推广农业丰产经验宣传中的两种偏向

    纠正推广农业丰产经验宣传中的两种偏向
    半年以来，各地报纸一般都已重视了农业丰产经验的总结和推广。有些经验如曲耀离棉花密植经验，经过报纸的反复宣传，已成为广大棉农发挥潜在力和提高单位面积产量的榜样。这是一方面。但另一方面，还有一些报纸在推广某些农业丰产经验的报道中，不能根据农业生产的特点，进行正确的深入的宣传，而发生了脱离实际脱离群众的命令主义和经验主义倾向。
    推广农业丰产经验宣传中命令主义的具体表现，是强迫农民普遍推广新的耕作法。这以川西日报表现的最为突出。川西在今春曾发生强迫普遍推广水稻“稀株密植”法的偏向。有的乡干部自己还不懂“稀株密植”，就强迫农民实行“稀株密植”，致引起农民的不满。有的县份竟主观地订出全县“稀株密植”计划，强迫农民普遍推广。川西日报对这种强迫命令的作法，不但没有及时予以批判纠正，反而多次地作了盲目的宣传和表扬。例如，五月八日该报在“张玉山互助组作好插秧准备”消息中，就曾对“立刻把已挖好不合格的厢沟改了”的强迫作法作了表扬。该报在五月十一日“金堂官仓乡人民政府及时宣传推广稀株密植法”消息中，一方面指明金堂官仓乡二村五十个村干部中，有二十九个人不相信或半信半疑，另一方面又肯定了乡人民政府纠正了“保守思想”，七百余亩早水田已“绝大部分”采用稀株密植法。川西日报这种不切实际的宣传，直至五月十七日川西人民行政公署农林厅发出“关于纠正推行‘稀株密植’中发生偏向的指示”以后，才开始得到纠正。这种强迫普遍推广的偏向所以发生，显然是由于这些报纸编辑部不了解重点试验的方针，没有掌握农业科学技术的基本知识。
    当然，过于强调农业技术的地域性、特殊性，而完全拒绝外地先进经验的宣传和介绍，也是非常错误的。重庆新华日报的读者们曾写信要求该报介绍全国其他地方的丰产经验，如山西曲耀离的种棉经验等。可是新华日报却采取了拒绝的态度，认为：“农业生产受地域性的限制很大，北方的经验拿到南方就不一定能适用。”（见三月二十三日该报“编者按”）因而，该报对外地的农业丰产经验，就一直没有加以介绍。毫无疑义，在推广农业丰产经验时，不只北方的经验不能硬搬到南方去机械地应用，就是对某一省、某一县、某一农民的丰产经验，也不能随便硬搬乱用，必须根据当地农民的觉悟程度和生产条件，有重点地逐步加以推行。但这是不是说，报纸可以据此而对于已推行有效的外地先进经验，就不能加以批判地介绍了呢？这是不是说，这些先进经验的基本原则也“不一定能适用”呢？显然不是这样。因为，在事实上，山西曲耀离的植棉经验，就是采用了苏联的“稀株密植”先进经验的结果；这种经验在西南雨水较多，气候潮湿的情况下，也不是不能“适用”的。四月十五日重庆新华日报发表的西南农林部工业原料处“总结植棉模范的丰产经验，提高棉花单位面积产量”一文，就否定了这种保守的观点。该文说明根据苏联的先进经验，以及山西省曲耀离和北京国营双桥农场的丰产结果，“棉花必须适当的密植”，并指出在西南地区，根据一定的条件，“就原来每亩株数的基础上，适当地酌量增加密度，洋棉每亩植棉株数以二千四百株至二千八百株，较为适当。”这就说明重庆新华日报拒不介绍外地先进经验的态度，实际上也是脱离实际、脱离群众的。
    上述事实证明，无论是强迫命令的偏向，或是狭隘经验主义的偏向，都直接有害于农业丰产运动的开展。
