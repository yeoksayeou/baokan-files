    The "Hospitality" Received by Ridgway During His Inspection of Europe
    Ye Chuangfu

    Since taking up his new post as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggressor Forces on May 27, Ridgway has begun his "inspection" of Europe. Although Truman desperately touted this bacterial general, saying he had a "broad vision of international military responsibility," Ridgway's mood was gloomy when he left Tokyo. The magnificent procession of the Japanese people's "May Day" demonstration made him feel lingering fear. Obviously, he could not expect a polite reception from the European people either.

    In Paris, Ridgway heard the same roar as on the streets of Tokyo: "Ridgway, go back to America!"

    During the Paris Commune uprising in 1871, the great French poet Victor Hugo wrote:
    "This is Paris, the city that mixes Europe together,
    Using human rights, glory and art, these three breasts,
    To nurture this sacred child: 'The Future'."
    He also used the following verses to praise the heroes of Paris:
    "The woman who once enchanted the world,
    Now terrifies the world."

    On May 27th, Paris once again showed its heroism, terrifying the war camp. The people of Paris denounced Ridgway and the war instigators before the whole world. The demonstrating crowds filled the squares planted with "trees of liberty," the streets with moving monuments and historical buildings; police everywhere encountered impenetrable walls of people; the descendants of the heroes of the Paris Commune declared in the glorious name of French heroes: the city of Vaillant-Couturier and its residents must not allow war criminals to defile our city streets.

    Ridgway scurried out of France in embarrassment, leaving behind him a wave of popular anger and hatred. The Pétain-like, traitorous government faithfully carried out the orders of its American masters, using medieval tyrant and Nazi-style methods to suppress patriotic people, but the answer it received was even more large-scale protest demonstrations.

    In Rome, although the weak Gasperi reactionary government mobilized the largest police force possible - 30,000 military police - it was unable to protect the "majesty" of the American general. The Italian people broke through police sentry posts and cordons, and victoriously held powerful demonstrations.

    As soon as the news spread of where Ridgway was preparing to go, the people of that place would definitely rise up in protest. While Ridgway was still in Rome, tens of thousands of people in Copenhagen shouted "Down with the plague general!" When Ridgway arrived in West Germany on June 23, the people of West Germany gave him the same "welcome" he had received in France and Italy. When Ridgway arrived in Norway on June 30, Oslo was plastered with slogans against the plague general Ridgway.

    The French newspaper L'Humanité once pointed out: "The imperialists want to establish a 'European Army,' but they cannot obtain the army they expect; what appears before them are thousands of men and women, masses who are determined to defend the cause of peace to the end." Facts have proven that the European people will not fight for Wall Street's interests. Despite the bayonets and batons clearing the way, the military road that Ridgway is taking is very narrow and short.

    With Ridgway's arrival, the threat of war in Europe has become more serious. As soon as Ridgway set foot on European soil, he arrogantly clamored: "I will use the methods tested in the Korean War… to strive to establish the defense of Western Europe (should read: to carry out aggression against Western Europe)." On the same day, the so-called "European Army" treaty was also signed in Paris. Twelve divisions of Nazi troops will be armed according to the treaty, becoming the main force under Ridgway's command. Ridgway wants to bring the methods he used in Korea of using bacteriological weapons and other large-scale massacres of residents to Europe, turning Paris, Rome, and Berlin into Seoul.

    However, the European people heroically denounced the war instigators' conspiracy, and declared to the world: "Ridgway is a war criminal." No matter where Ridgway goes, he cannot escape the people's angry condemnation: "Ridgway - plague demon," "Ridgway get out!"

    Where is Ridgway going? This bacterial general has the title of Supreme Commander of the Atlantic Aggressor Forces, but his situation is pitiful. He has neither an army nor a rear. The country where the Paris Commune once appeared is dangerous to him, can Italy be a reliable military base? The Italian people answered him: No! Rome is to become the Italian "capital of the struggle for peace." The road to war is blocked everywhere, leaving Ridgway only the road to the Nuremberg Tribunal.

    The American aggressors cowardly drove their police dogs to attack the people of France, Italy and other countries, thinking that the police's combat might enhance Ridgway's military honor, but the people thwarted it.

    The French people have set a glorious example for the struggle for peace with their heroic actions. The spirit of unity and bravery of the French people is unprecedented: not a single worker at the Farman aircraft factory in Paris hesitated in responding to the strike call; workers at the Lucigne factory, who had been silent for twenty years, also indignantly joined the strike; the working people of Toulouse, unarmed, repelled the police's attacks. The lies of the right-wing Socialist Party and the Catholic trade unions went bankrupt as shamefully as the threats of the Pétain-like officials, and people from all walks of life widely united in the ranks of the patriotic movement. These facts occurred during police terror and suppression, and are particularly precious.

    The powerful protest movement of the people of Western European countries against Ridgway shows that the great struggle of the Western European people for democratic freedom, national independence, and the defense of peace is advancing. The American aggressors are inciting the traitorous governments of various vassal states to intensify the suppression of the people. They vainly attempt to drown the people's just struggle in blood. But this is futile, just like pouring oil on fire.

    During the demonstration, the people of Paris hung a paper effigy of Ridgway on a lamppost, which is a symbol. The people of the world will send Ridgway to the gallows with a just trial.

### 李奇微在巡视欧洲中受到的“招待”

    李奇微在巡视欧洲中受到的“招待”
    叶闯夫
    李奇微自五月二十七日就任北大西洋侵略军统帅新职之后，开始了在欧洲的“巡视”。尽管杜鲁门拚命替这个细菌将军吹嘘，说他有“广大的国际军事责任的远景”，但李奇微离开东京时的心情是黯淡的。日本人民“五一”节大示威的雄伟行列，使他心有余悸。显然，他也不能期望欧洲人民的客气的款待。
    在巴黎，李奇微听到了和东京街道上所发出的同样的吼声：“李奇微滚回美国去！”
    一八七一年巴黎公社起义时，法国大诗人雨果曾经这样写道：
    “这就是巴黎，这个把欧洲混合在一起的城市，
    用了人权、光荣和艺术，这三个乳房，
    哺养这神圣的孩子：‘将来’。”
    他也用如下诗句歌颂巴黎的英雄：
    “从前媚惑世界的女人，
    现在却使世界惊惶失措。”
    五月二十七日的巴黎，又一次显出它的英雄气概，使战争阵营惊惶失措。巴黎人民在全世界面前斥责李奇微，斥责战争挑拨者。示威的人群集满了种着“自由之树”的广场、有着动人的纪念碑和历史建筑物的街道；警察到处碰到无法越过的人墙；巴黎公社英雄的后代以法国英雄的光荣名字宣称：瓦扬—古久里的城及其居民决不许战争罪犯玷污我们的市区道路。
    李奇微狼狈地匆匆溜出了法国，留在他身后的是人民的愤怒与憎恨的浪潮。比内卖国政府忠实执行了美国主子的命令，用中世纪暴君和纳粹式的手段镇压爱国人民，所得到的回答却是规模更加壮阔的抗议示威。
    在罗马，孱弱的加斯贝利反动政府虽然动员了最大的警察力量——三万军警，也没有能够保护美国将军的“威严”。意大利人民冲破了警察的岗哨和警戒线，胜利地举行了强大的示威。
    李奇微准备到什么地方去的消息一经传出，那地方的人民就一定奋起抗议。当李奇微还在罗马，哥本哈根成千成万的人民就高呼“打倒瘟疫将军”了。李奇微六月二十三日到了西德，西德各地人民又给他以他在法国和意大利所受到的同样的“欢迎”。六月三十日李奇微到了挪威，奥斯陆城里就到处贴满了反对瘟疫将军李奇微的标语。
    法国人道报曾经指出：“帝国主义者要成立‘欧洲军’，然而，他们不能够获得所期望的那样的军队；出现在他们面前的是成千成万的男子和妇女，坚决维护和平事业到底的群众。”事实证明，欧洲人民不会为华尔街利益去作战。尽管有刺刀和警棍开道，但是，李奇微所走的军事道路是很窄短的。
    随着李奇微的到达，欧洲的战争威胁更严重了。李奇微的脚刚踏上欧洲的土地，就狂妄地叫嚣：“将以在朝鲜战争中考验过的方法……努力建立西欧的防御（应读作进行对西欧的侵略）。”同一天，所谓“欧洲军”的条约也在巴黎签订了。十二个师的纳粹军队将按照条约被武装起来，成为李奇微麾下的主力。李奇微要把他在朝鲜使用细菌武器和其他大规模屠杀居民的方法带到欧洲，使巴黎、罗马、柏林都变成汉城。
    但是，欧洲人民英勇地斥责了战争挑拨者的阴谋，向全世界宣告：“李奇微是战争罪犯”。李奇微不管到那里，也逃不开人民愤怒的声讨：“李奇微——瘟魔”、“李奇微滚出去”。
    李奇微往那里去呢？这个细菌将军空有大西洋侵略军最高司令官的头衔，但境遇是可悲的。他既没有军队，也没有后方。曾经出现过巴黎公社的国家对他是危险的，意大利能是可靠的军事基地吗？意大利人民回答他：不！罗马要成为意大利“争取和平斗争的首都”。战争的道路处处不通，留给李奇微的只有走向纽伦堡法庭的道路了。
    美国侵略者卑怯地驱使它的警犬对法意等国人民进攻，他们以为警察的战斗或许能提高李奇微的军事荣誉，但是，人民挫败了它。
    法国人民以自己的英雄行动为和平斗争树立了光辉的榜样。法国人民那种团结和英勇的精神是空前的：巴黎法尔曼飞机工厂没有一个工人在响应罢工号召时表现了犹豫；沉默了二十年的卢西涅工厂的工人也激愤地参加了罢工；徒手的吐鲁斯劳动人民打退了警察的攻击。右翼社会党和天主教工会的谎言同比内的恫吓一样可耻地破产了，各阶层人民广泛地团结在爱国运动的行列里。这些事实都发生于警察恐怖的镇压中，是特别可珍贵的。
    西欧各国人民反对李奇微的强大抗议运动，表明了西欧人民争取民主自由、民族独立和保卫和平的伟大斗争正向前推进。美国侵略者则在唆使各附庸国的卖国政府加紧镇压人民。他们妄想把人民的正义斗争淹没在血泊中。但这是徒劳的，正如用油泼火一样。
    巴黎人民在示威时，曾把纸扎的李奇微吊到电灯杆上去，这是个象征。全世界人民将以正义的审判把李奇微送上绞架。
