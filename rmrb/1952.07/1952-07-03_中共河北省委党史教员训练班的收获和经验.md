    Gains and Experiences of the Party History Instructor Training Class of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Hu Bao?

    Starting in late March, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a Party History Instructor Training Class. There were 230 trainees in total. In addition to theoretical instructors from various regions, there were also education section chiefs from the district and municipal Party committees, organization and education section chiefs from the district and municipal Party schools, and political instructors from various specialized schools. Most of these trainees had a certain level of education (91% had at least a junior high school education) and had been tempered by a period of revolutionary work; however, their theoretical level was not high, most had not systematically studied Party history, and their understanding of the Party's history was very limited. In light of this situation, the training class adopted a teaching method that focused on lectures, supplemented by self-study, discussions, question-and-answer sessions, and classroom discussions.

    After two months of study, the trainees gained a preliminary understanding of the basic content and spirit of Mao Zedong Thought and increased their consciousness in studying Mao Zedong Thought. Before the study, the general understanding of the correctness and greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and its important significance to the Chinese revolution was insufficient and superficial. They also did not quite understand how to study Mao Zedong Thought through the study of Party history. For example, at the beginning of the study, many people said, "Party history is about the past, what's the use of studying it!" and "Can studying Party history be considered theoretical study?" But after a period of study, they realized the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and recognized that Comrade Mao Zedong was the representative of Chinese Bolshevism from the beginning. In addition, everyone had a preliminary understanding of the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought's stand, viewpoint, and method—the method of class analysis and concrete analysis of concrete things. From this, they realized the importance of revolutionary theory to revolutionary practice and the importance of launching the study of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party.

    Through the study of criticizing opportunism within the Party, the trainees recognized the harm of petty-bourgeois ideology within the Party to the revolution, recognized the serious significance of ideological transformation, and most comrades preliminarily examined their own thinking. At the beginning of the study, many trainees did not fully recognize the harm of petty-bourgeois ideology remaining within the Party, thinking that it was merely "liberalism," "loose discipline," and "concern for face." Some even thought that petty-bourgeois ideology was semi-legal within the Party, that "everyone has it," and that it could coexist peacefully with proletarian ideology. After listening to the report, although they recognized the harm that opportunists inflicted on the Party's cause, they were surprised and puzzled, and still could not understand the harm of petty-bourgeois ideology to the Chinese revolution. Therefore, in the discussion, many people still thought that "left is better than right," saying things like "'Left' is revolutionary, right is not revolutionary," "'Left' is a matter of method, right is a matter of stand," "'Left' can complete the task, right cannot complete the task." But after analyzing and criticizing their own thinking in connection with reality, they discovered that their own thinking and the views of opportunism were not without common ground. Only then did they realize that the ideological root of opportunism is petty-bourgeois ideology, and that both "left" and right are reflections of petty-bourgeois ideology within the Party, and both will cause losses to the revolution. Thus, they recognized the importance of transforming petty-bourgeois ideology. After the concluding remarks of the Party history study, some comrades examined their relationship with the Party, criticized their erroneous idea of not wanting to engage in theoretical education work, and expressed their willingness to treat the Party's theoretical education work loyally.

    Through the study of Party history, the trainees correctly recognized the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the Party's policy of both uniting with and struggling against the bourgeoisie. In this study, the trainees exposed many erroneous views on the bourgeoisie. For example, some comrades believed that "the revolutionary nature of the bourgeoisie is false," that "the bourgeoisie had a dual nature in the past, but now only has a reactionary side," and therefore advocated "implementing socialism ahead of schedule." After discussion and analysis, everyone correctly recognized the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the Party's policy of both uniting with and struggling against the bourgeoisie, and recognized that any thought or practice that ignores unity or relaxes struggle will cause serious losses to the cause of new democratic construction.

    Through the study of Party history, the trainees had a general understanding of the history of our Party leading the Chinese people in carrying out a vigorous revolutionary struggle. They had a relatively clear understanding of the key issues that determined the success or failure of the revolution in each historical period, and criticized and corrected many erroneous ideas. For example, on the issue of revolutionary leadership, some people believed that "the First Revolutionary Civil War was led by the Kuomintang" or "jointly led by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." Others believed that "the Anti-Japanese National United Front was merely a formality and did not play a role," etc. All these incorrect understandings were generally resolved through explanation, discussion, and answering questions. In the process of solving these problems, the reactionary orthodox ideas of newly employed intellectual cadres were cleared away; the empiricism of some old rural cadres was criticized.

    In short, two months of study have improved the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought levels of the trainees, which has provided good conditions for this year's Party history study and on-the-job cadre theoretical study; and has made ideological and organizational preparations for next year's theoretical study.

    The Hebei Provincial Committee Party History Instructor Training Class has gained the following experiences in this session of teaching work: First, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of studying Mao Zedong Thought through the study of Party history. In the process of trainees' study, some phenomena that violated this principle occurred. For example: some people "listened to rarities" with a curious mentality, arguing about some issues that were not closely related to the study of Mao Zedong Thought; or mechanically memorizing conclusions without connecting them to reality, etc. The leadership promptly pointed out and corrected these deviations, so that the study could proceed along the right track.

    After adhering to the correct study principle, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of less is more. Party history is an encyclopedia of basic knowledge of the Chinese revolution, and the content of Mao Zedong Thought is extremely rich. It is impossible to learn it all well in a short period of time. Thus, it is necessary to adopt the method of focusing on key learning, that is, grasping the key issues that determine the success or failure of the revolution and affect the overall situation of the revolution, and conducting repeated and in-depth research so that trainees can gain a relatively thorough understanding of these issues, thereby understanding the correct propositions put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in various periods. However, it is also necessary to take into account that most trainees know very little about Party history, so a general introduction to Party history is still necessary in order to make everyone clear about the ins and outs of Party history. In the study, it is necessary to guide everyone to conduct concrete analysis of specific problems, and prevent deviations such as swallowing dates whole and proceeding from concepts.

    In guiding the study of Party history, it is necessary to induce everyone to connect with ideological reality, launch ideological struggle, and use this to understand Mao Zedong Thought. In the study, these two deviations occurred: one is the dogmatic deviation, and the other is the empiricist deviation. Without deeply studying and understanding the spirit of the documents, they rushed to connect with reality. As a result, when discussing problems, they were rambling and fragmented, and could not raise the problems to the Party's general line, general policy, and the proletariat's stand, viewpoint, and method. Only by paying attention to overcoming these two deviations can we guide everyone to correctly combine theory and practice and gradually understand Mao Zedong Thought.

    中共河北省委党史教员训练班的收获和经验
    扈葆?
    从三月下旬开始，中共河北省委举办了一期党史教员训练班。受训的学员共有二百三十人。其中除各地的理论教员外，并有地委、市委的教育科长，地委、市委党校的组织教育科长及各专业学校的政治教员。这些学员大部分具有一定的文化水平（有初中以上文化程度的占百分之九十一），并经过一定时期的革命工作的锻炼；但理论水平不高，大多没有系统地学过党史，对党的历史了解得很少。根据这种情况，训练班采用了讲课为主，自学、讨论、问题解答、课堂讨论为辅的教学方法。
    经过两个月的学习，学员们初步地领会了毛泽东思想的基本内容和精神，提高了学习毛泽东思想的自觉性。学习以前，一般学员对毛泽东思想的正确和伟大及其对中国革命的重要意义的认识是不够的、肤浅的，也不太懂得通过学习党史来学习毛泽东思想。譬如学习开始时，还有不少人说：“党史是过去的事，学它有什么用！”“学党史也能算理论学习吗？”但经过一段时间的学习，就体会到毛泽东思想的伟大，认识了毛泽东同志一开始就是中国的布尔什维主义的代表。另外，大家对于马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法——阶级分析和对具体事物进行具体分析的方法，也有了初步的体会。而且由此体会到革命理论对革命实践的重要性和在全党展开学习毛泽东思想的重要意义。
    学员们在批判党内的机会主义的学习中，认识了党内小资产阶级思想对革命的危害性，认识了思想改造的严重意义，大部分同志并初步检查了自己的思想。学习之初，有许多学员对残存在党内的小资产阶级思想的危害性是认识不足的，认为这不过是“自由主义”、“自由散漫”、“爱面子”而已。甚至还有人认为小资产阶级思想在党内是半合法的，“人皆有之”，它可以和无产阶级思想和平共居。在听了报告以后，虽然也认识了机会主义者给予党的事业的危害，但又感到惊讶和奇怪，仍然不能理解小资产阶级思想对中国革命的危害性。因而在讨论中，还有很多人认为“‘左’比右好”，说什么“‘左’是革命的，右是不革命的”，“‘左’是方法问题，右是立场问题”，“‘左’能完成任务，右不能完成任务”。但在联系自己的思想进行了分析批判以后，发现了自己的思想和机会主义的观点不无共同之处，这才认识了机会主义的思想根源就是小资产阶级思想，认识了“左”和右都是小资产阶级思想在党内的反映，都会给革命造成损失。从而认识了改造小资产阶级思想的重要意义。在学习党史的结束语后，有的同志检查了自己和党的关系，批判了自己不愿作理论教育工作的错误思想，表示要忠诚地对待党的理论教育工作。
    通过党史学习，学员们正确地认识了中国民族资产阶级的两面性和党对资产阶级又团结又斗争的政策。在这次学习中，学员们暴露了对资产阶级的许多错误看法。例如有些同志认为“资产阶级的革命性是假的”，“资产阶级过去有两面性，现在只有反动的一面”，因而主张“提前实行社会主义”。经过讨论分析，大家正确地认识了中国民族资产阶级的两面性和党对待资产阶级又联合又斗争的政策，认识了任何忽视联合或放松斗争的思想和作法，都会给新民主主义的建设事业造成严重损失。
    通过党史学习，学员们对我党领导中国人民进行轰轰烈烈革命斗争的历史，有了一个梗概的认识，对于每个历史时期决定革命成败关键的问题有了比较明确的了解，并批判和纠正了许多错误思想。例如在革命领导权问题上，曾有人认为“第一次国内革命战争是国民党领导的”或“国共两党共同领导的”。又有人认为“抗日民族统一战线不过是形式，不起作用”等。所有这些不正确的认识，通过讲解、讨论和解答问题，一般地获得了解决。在解决这些问题的过程中，清除了新参加工作的知识分子干部的反动的正统观念；批判了一部分农村老干部的经验主义。
    总之，两个月的学习，已使受训学员的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想水平较前提高了，这就为今年的党史学习和在职干部理论学习提供了良好的条件；并为明年的理论学习作了思想上、组织上的准备。
    河北省委党史教员训练班在这一期的教学工作中，取得了如下的经验：首先是必须坚持执行通过学习党史来学习毛泽东思想的方针。在学员的学习过程中，曾经发生了一些和这一方针相违背的现象。例如：有些人用一种好奇的心理“听稀罕”，争论一些和学习毛泽东思想无大关联的问题；或者死记结论，不联系实际等。领导方面及时地指出和纠正了这些偏向，使学习得以循着轨道进行。
    在坚持执行了正确的学习方针之后，又必须坚持少而精的学习原则。党史是中国革命基本知识的百科全书，毛泽东思想的内容极其丰富，要在短时间内全部把它学好是不可能的。这样就必须采取重点学习的方法，即抓住决定革命成败、影响革命全局的关键问题，作反复深入的研究，使学员对这些问题获得比较透彻的了解，从而领会毛泽东同志在各个时期所提出的正确主张。但又要照顾到大部分学员对党史所知很少，因此对党史还须作一概括的介绍，以便使大家弄清党史的来龙去脉。在学习中，要引导大家对具体问题进行具体分析，防止囫囵吞枣和从概念出发等偏向。
    在指导党史学习中，必须诱导大家联系思想实际，展开思想斗争，借以领会毛泽东思想。在学习中曾发生过这两种偏向：一种是教条主义偏向。另一种是经验主义的偏向：没有深入钻研和领会文件精神，就急于联系实际，结果讨论问题时，漫无边际，零星片断，不能把问题提高到党的总路线总政策和无产阶级的立场、观点、方法上来认识。只有注意克服这两种偏向，才能引导大家把理论和实际正确地结合起来，逐步地领会毛泽东思想。
