    I. In the past few years, significant achievements have been made in preferential treatment work in various regions. The political consciousness and work enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers have been significantly improved. Many model figures and events have emerged, and many good systems and methods have been created. Many places have convened symposiums of families of martyrs and military personnel at the township level and representative meetings of model families of martyrs and military personnel (including disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel) above the county level. At these meetings, work was reviewed, experiences were exchanged, mutual evaluations were conducted, and models were elected, yielding good results. For this reason, the Ministry has decided to conduct a campaign to appraise and select models of preferential treatment nationwide from after the autumn harvest of 1952 to around the Spring Festival of 1953. We hope that all regions will immediately begin planning and preparations.

    II. Models of preferential treatment are divided into: (1) Models of families of martyrs and military personnel;
    (2) Models of disabled revolutionary soldiers; (3) Models of demobilized soldiers; (4) Models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel, divided into collective and individual types: collective models are model townships (villages) and model land cultivation teams; individual models are model cadres and model masses. The criteria for models shall be formulated by each province based on specific circumstances. In principle: cadres and the masses should have a correct understanding of the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, be able to regularly help families of martyrs and military personnel solve difficulties in production and life, have practical performance and achievements, and be recognized by the masses; families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers should have a correct understanding of their political status, be able to actively participate in production and various social activities, care about the interests of the masses, have practical performance and achievements, and be recognized by the masses.

    III. Models of preferential treatment should first be selected in townships (villages). The selection of models should be used to review this year's preferential treatment work, and models should be better cultivated in the review of preferential treatment work; symposiums of families of martyrs and military personnel should be held to listen to the opinions of families of martyrs and military personnel; the role of the preferential treatment work committee should be brought into play in the selection campaign, and this organization should be rectified and consolidated. The determination of model figures in townships should be discussed and approved by the township people's representative conference.

    After the selection of each township is completed, the county should convene a county-level representative meeting of families of martyrs and military personnel, or when convening a labor model representative meeting, absorb representative model figures from each township to participate. At this meeting, county-level model figures, villages, and land cultivation teams should be produced. A report should be made to the county people's representative conference for approval.

    The method for producing urban models can be handled with reference to the methods of counties and townships.

    Whether the province should convene a provincial representative meeting of model families of martyrs and military personnel or other meetings to produce provincial-level models shall be decided by each province. If it is not convened, the materials from each county should be compared and selected to determine the provincial-level models.

    IV. People's governments at all levels should give various models honorary and material rewards. Honorary awards can include medals, certificates, banners, etc., and material awards can include livestock, agricultural tools, daily necessities, etc. The amount of rewards shall be determined by the provincial people's governments in accordance with the principle of thrift and practicality, and reimbursed within the budget of preferential treatment expenses.

    V. After the selection is completed, the selection process and selection materials should be reported level by level, and at the same time, propaganda and education should be carried out among the masses. The provinces should complete the selection before and after the Spring Festival of 1953. In addition to reporting to the civil affairs department of the Greater Administrative Area, each province should directly report the selection process and model materials to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government.

    关于评选烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人模范及拥军优属模范的指示
    一、几年来各地优抚工作有很大成绩，广大人民与烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人的政治觉悟和工作积极性，有显著的提高，涌现出不少的模范人物与事例，创造了很多好的制度和办法，许多地方召开了乡的烈、军属座谈会和县以上的烈属、军属模范代表会议（包括革命残废军人、复员军人与拥军优属模范），在会议上检查工作，交流经验，相互评比，选举模范，收到了很好的效果。为此，本部决定自一九五二年秋收以后，至一九五三年春节前后，在全国进行一次评选优抚模范的运动，希各地立即开始计划与筹备。
    二、优抚模范分为：（一）烈属、军属模范；
    （二）革命残废军人模范；（三）复员军人模范；（四）拥军优属模范，分集体与个人两种：集体为模范乡（村）、模范代耕组；个人为模范干部与模范群众。模范条件由各省根据具体情况拟订。其原则：在干部与群众方面，应是对拥军优属工作有正确的认识，能够经常帮助烈属、军属等解决生产与生活中的困难，有实际的表现与成绩，而为群众所公认者；在烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人方面，应是对自己的政治地位有正确认识，能够经常积极参加生产和各种社会活动，关心群众利益，有实际的表现与成绩，而为群众所公认者。
    三、优抚模范首先在乡（村）评选。要通过选举模范来检查今年的优抚工作，在检查优抚工作中更好地培养模范；召开烈属、军属座谈会，听取烈、军属意见；在评选运动中应发挥优抚工作委员会的作用，整顿与巩固这一组织。乡的模范人物的确定，应由乡人民代表会议讨论通过。
    县应在各乡评选完毕后，召开县烈属、军属代表会议，或在召开劳动模范代表会议时，吸收各乡优抚模范代表人物参加，在此会议上产生县一级的模范人物、村庄和代耕组。并向县人民代表会议报告通过。
    城市模范产生办法，可参照县、乡办法办理。
    省是否召开省烈属、军属模范代表会议或其他会议，产生省一级的模范，由各省自行决定。如不召开则应就各县材料，加以比较选择，决定省一级的模范。
    四、各级人民政府应分别给予各种模范以名誉和物质奖励，名誉奖可发奖章、奖状、锦旗等，物质奖可发牲畜、农具、日用品等。奖励费由各省人民政府本节约而实际的原则规定数目，在优抚事业费预算内报销。
    五、评选完毕，应将评选经过与评选材料逐级上报，同时在群众中进行宣传教育。省应于一九五三年春节前后评选完毕，各省除向大行政区民政部作报告外，应将评选经过与模范材料直接向中央人民政府内务部作一次报告。七月十一日
