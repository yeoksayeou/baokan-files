Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent a cable to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on the 14th, congratulating the Japanese Communist Party on its 30th anniversary. The text of the cable is as follows:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union warmly congratulates the fraternal Japanese Communist Party on the 30th anniversary of its founding.

The Japanese Communist Party has traversed a glorious path of struggle for the cause of the working class and for the benefit of the Japanese people. Today, Japan is under the iron heel of the occupation forces, and the entire nation is suffering humiliation. The Japanese Communist Party is fighting heroically. Workers, peasants, and intellectuals are gradually convinced that only the Communist Party can unite the democratic forces of Japan and lead the motherland to a broad road of national rejuvenation, true democracy, and economic development.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the struggle of the Japanese people for freedom and national independence, against foreign imperialism and its Japanese lackeys, is growing stronger. This struggle of the Japanese people is an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and is supported by the democratic forces of the world.

The Japanese Communist Party is equipped with a program that embodies the hopes and aspirations of the Japanese people, to meet its 30th anniversary. Based on this program, the Japanese Communist Party will victoriously continue to consolidate the unity within the Party, which is a primary condition for the victory of the progressive forces in Japan.

We congratulate the Japanese Communist Party on achieving new victories on their glorious path.

Long live the friendship between the Soviet and Japanese peoples!

Long live the fraternal Japanese Communist Party!

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Communist and Workers' parties of various countries have sent congratulatory cables to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party said in its congratulatory telegram on the 14th: For thirty years, the Japanese Communist Party, as the vanguard of the Japanese working class, has not only led the Japanese people's struggle against militarism, but is now organizing and inspiring the Japanese people's struggle against the American imperialists for the independence and peace of the Japanese nation. The struggle of the Japanese people against the American imperialist occupiers and the Yoshida government under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, and the struggle of the Korean people against the American imperialist aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitors under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, are great contributions to the cause of peace. At the same time, the support and solidarity given by the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people to the Korean people's struggle against the common enemy of the Korean and Japanese peoples—the American imperialists—has further encouraged the Korean people's struggle.

The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party said in its congratulatory telegram: The powerful national liberation movement in Japan proves that the plans of the American imperialists are doomed to shameful failure, and they will never achieve their goal of using the Japanese people as cannon fodder in the war of aggression against Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party wishes the Japanese people to be liberated from the enslavement of American imperialism and reactionaries.

The telegram of Georghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, said: The Japanese Communist Party defends the true national interests of the Japanese people, is loyal to the lofty ideals of proletarian internationalism, has always opposed the criminal wars provoked by militarists, and exposes the criminal essence of the Emperor system. Today, the Japanese Communist Party is the heroic leader of the Japanese people, leading them in opposing the occupation and enslavement of Japan by American imperialists, and opposing the American imperialists' criminal conspiracy to turn the war of aggression against Korea into a world massacre.

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party wished the Japanese Communist Party greater achievements in the struggle for national independence, defending peace, and opposing the bloody terror of American imperialism and its running dogs.

Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, congratulated the Japanese Communist Party and said: We are convinced that the Japanese people, who will never forget the tragedies of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, will certainly not allow the arrogant American rulers to realize their horrific war conspiracy. The congratulatory telegram emphasized the great significance of establishing a national liberation democratic united front based on the new program of the JCP. This is the only force that can lead Japan out of foreign bondage and save the Japanese people from war and increasingly severe poverty.

The congratulatory telegram from the Indonesian Communist Party emphasized: The Indonesian Communist Party is determined to support the struggle of the Japanese Communist Party for the establishment of national freedom and peace in Japan.

    苏联共产党中央委员会热烈地向兄弟般的日本共产党祝贺建党三十周年。
    日本共产党走过了为工人阶级的事业，为日本人民群众的利益而斗争的光荣道路。日本今天处在占领军的铁蹄下，全民族蒙受着耻辱，日本共产党正在英勇斗争。工人、农民和知识分子们逐渐深信：只有共产党才能团结日本的民主力量，领导祖国走向民族复兴、真正民主和经济发展的广阔大道。
    在共产党的领导下，日本全国争取自由和民族独立、反对外国帝国主义及其日本奴才的斗争声势日壮。日本人民的这个斗争，对于保持远东和平是一个重要的因素，并且受到全世界民主力量的支持。
    日本共产党以体现了日本人民的希望与宿愿的纲领武装着自己，来迎接它的三十周年纪念日。以这个纲领为基础，日本共产党将胜利地继续巩固党内的团结，这是日本进步力量取得胜利的一个首要条件。
    我们祝贺日本共产党在他们的光荣的道路上获得新的胜利。
    苏联与日本两国人民的友谊万岁！
    兄弟般的日本共产党万岁！
    【新华社十六日讯】各国共产党和工人党纷纷电贺日本共产党成立三十周年纪念。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会十四日的贺电说：三十年来，日本共产党作为日本工人阶级的先锋队，不仅领导了日本人民反对军国主义的斗争，而且在今天正为日本民族的独立与和平组织着和鼓舞着日本人民反对美帝国主义者的斗争。在日本共产党领导下的日本人民反对美帝国主义占领者及吉田政府的斗争，和在朝鲜劳动党领导下的朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者和李承晚叛徒的斗争，对于和平事业是巨大的贡献。同时，日本共产党和日本人民对朝鲜人民反对朝日两国人民共同的敌人——美帝国主义者——的斗争所给予的支持和声援，更鼓舞了朝鲜人民的斗争。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会的贺电说：日本的强有力的民族解放运动，证明美帝国主义者的计划注定要遭到可耻的失败，他们决达不到利用日本人民充当侵略朝鲜，侵略中国和苏联的战争的炮灰的目的。波兰统一工人党中央委员会预祝日本人民将从美帝国主义和反动派的奴役下解放出来。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治的贺电说：日本共产党保卫日本人民的真正民族利益，忠诚于无产阶级国际主义的崇高理想，始终反对军国主义分子挑起的罪恶战争，并揭露天皇制的罪恶本质。日本共产党今天是日本人民的英勇领导者，领导他们反对美帝国主义者占领和奴役日本，反对美帝国主义者把侵略朝鲜的战争变成世界大屠杀的罪恶阴谋。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的贺电祝日本共产党在争取民族独立、保卫和平、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的血腥恐怖统治的斗争中，取得更大的成就。
    英国共产党总书记哈利·波立特向日本共产党祝贺说：我们深信永远不会忘记长崎与广岛惨剧的日本人民，一定不会让狂妄的美国统治者实现恐怖的战争阴谋。贺电强调根据日共新纲领成立民族解放民主统一战线的伟大意义。这是能够领导日本挣脱外国的束缚、拯救日本人民跳出战争和愈来愈厉害的贫困的唯一的力量。
    印尼共产党的贺电强调说：印尼共产党决心支援日本共产党为争取建立日本的民族自由与和平而进行的斗争。
