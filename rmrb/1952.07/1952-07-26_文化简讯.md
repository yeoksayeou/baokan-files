	The Literacy Campaign is Fully Underway in All Units of the Northwest Military Region

	Since June, a rapid literacy campaign has been fully underway in all units of the People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region. In the teaching process, all units have universally adopted the method of "mutual aid in labor," such as having cadres with higher levels of education do more work and cadres with lower levels of education study more; having cadres from the headquarters and battalions/regiments go to the companies to help with work, and reducing the number of meetings for company and platoon cadres; organizing soldiers and cadres with higher levels of education to help the kitchen prepare meals, so that cooks can squeeze out time to study, etc. This has greatly enhanced the learning enthusiasm of cadres and soldiers. In more than a month of study, the literacy achievements of all units have been very significant. For example, Zhang Ba, a famous combat hero of a certain unit, increased his vocabulary from 1,200 characters to more than 2,700 characters after twenty days of study; the cooks of the 7th Company of a certain regiment, after twenty-three days of study, increased their vocabulary from an average of 355 characters per person to 2,365 characters. The entire class can now read the "People's Soldier" newspaper and popular reading materials, and can write simple articles and letters.

	The East China Culture Department's Affiliated Slide Workshop
	Will Supply a Large Quantity of Slide Projectors and Slides

	In order to promote slide projection work and conduct popular education to the broad masses, especially the rural masses, the Culture Department of the East China Military and Political Committee established a slide workshop last year. To coordinate with the current affairs propaganda of each period, the workshop has produced and distributed more than forty types of slides. Regarding the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, there are slides such as "How the Volunteers Annihilate American Soldiers?", "Air Force Hero Zhang Ji-hui", "The Immortal Internationalist Fighter - Luo Shengjiao", "Korean Old Woman Loves the Volunteers", etc.; regarding the Patriotic Health Campaign, there are "Adding a Child for the New Year", "Eliminating Germ Warfare", "Preventing and Controlling Bloodsucking Pests", "Eliminating Pests that Spread Epidemics", etc.; regarding agricultural production, there are "Rice Production Model Chen Yongkang", "How to Prevent and Control Cotton Red Spiders", "How to Prevent and Control Rice Borers", "Organizing is Better than Working Alone", "Nanhe Village Cooperative", etc.; regarding industrial production, there are "Old Worker Chen Wenbiao Became Acting Factory Director", "Stories by the Iron Smelting Furnace", etc.; regarding the Marriage Law, there are "Illustrated Marriage Law", "Marriage", etc. In addition, there are also "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party", "The First Batch of Female Pilots in New China", etc. All the slides are in full color. In order to make slide projection work serve national construction, the workshop plans to establish a printing plant and a slide projector manufacturing factory in the second half of this year to produce a large number of slides and slide projectors, constantly improve technology, and expand the scope of supply.

	"Wenyi Bao" No. 14 Published

	The 14th issue of this year's "Wenyi Bao" was published on the 25th.

	Works such as "Lovely China," "Report When the Noose is Around the Neck," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "My Son," and "A Short Biography of Liu Hulan" have been widely circulated among Chinese readers, and are especially welcomed by young students. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Shanghai Municipal Student Federation jointly recommended these works as selected reading materials for young students during the summer vacation. The article "The Role of Literary Works in Cultivating New Morality and New Qualities in Youth" (by Su Ping) published in this issue of "Wenyi Bao" provides a comprehensive review of the ideological content of these works, helping readers to better understand them.

	"Journey to the West" is one of the folk tales loved by the broad masses. Many of its plots have been adapted into dramas of many different forms and performed in various places, among which "Havoc in Heaven" (originally named "Pacifying Heaven Assembly") is the most popular. The play "New Havoc in Heaven" written by Wei Chenxu and performed in Beijing this spring is adapted from "Havoc in Heaven". Due to the playwright's lack of a serious and responsible attitude and correct viewpoint towards the heritage of national opera, the play "New Havoc in Heaven" produced many errors of principle. The article "Treat the Heritage of National Opera Seriously" (by Ma Yanxiang) published in "Wenyi Bao" conducts a concrete analysis and criticism of some fundamental errors existing in this script, especially regarding the playwright's anti-historical viewpoint.

	Regarding the issue of literary realism, "Wenyi Bao" has received many questions from readers requesting answers. "Wenyi Bao" published Feng Xuefeng's "An Outline of the Development of Chinese Literature from Classical Realism to Proletarian Realism" in this issue, specifically the section "What is Classical Realism in Chinese Literature?", which first discusses the content of the two basic trends in literature—realism and romanticism—as well as the relationship between realism and active romanticism, specifically pointing out that from the perspective of literary development history, the basic spirit and main trend of literature of all ethnic groups is realism. Furthermore, it gives an outline review of classical realism literature in China during the three periods from the "Book of Songs" era to the Opium War in feudal society. The other four sections of this article will be published in "Wenyi Bao" successively.

	"Discussion on the Issue of Creating New Heroic Figures," "Wenyi Bao" continues to publish two articles in this issue. The discussion on this issue raised in the ninth issue of this year's "Wenyi Bao" is gradually expanding and deepening.

    文化简讯
    西北军区各部队识字运动全面展开
    人民解放军西北军区各部队，自六月份起已全面展开速成识字运动。各部在教学过程中，普遍采用了“变工互助”的办法，如让文化程度较高的干部多工作，文化程度低的干部多学习；机关和营、团干部多下连队帮助工作，少调连排干部开会；组织文化程度较高的战士和干部帮助伙房作饭，使炊事员挤出时间学习等。这样就大大提高了干部和战士们的学习情绪。在一个多月学习中，各部队的识字成绩非常显著。如某部著名的战斗英雄张八，经过二十天的学习，已从认识一千二百字提高到二千七百多字；某团七连炊事班的人员，经过二十三天的学习，由原来平均每人识三百五十五个字提高到二千三百六十五个字。全班都已能阅读“人民战士”报和通俗读物，并且能写简单的文章和书信。华东文化部附设幻灯工场
    将大量供应幻灯机和幻灯片
    华东军政委员会文化部为了推广幻灯放映工作，向广大群众，特别是农村群众进行普及教育，在去年创办了一个幻灯工场。配合各个时期的时事宣传，该场已经制作和发行的幻灯片共有四十余种。关于抗美援朝的，有“志愿军是怎样消灭美国兵的？”、“空军英雄张积慧”、“不朽的国际主义战士——罗盛教”、“朝鲜老大娘热爱志愿军”等片；关于爱国卫生运动的，有“添丁过年”、“消灭细菌战”、“防治吸血病虫”、“扑灭传布疫病的害虫”等；关于农业生产的，有“水稻丰产模范陈永康”、“怎样防治棉花红蜘蛛”、“怎样防治螟虫”、“组织起来比单干强”、“南河村合作社”等片；关于工业生产的，有“老工人陈文标当了代理场长”、“熔铁炉旁的故事”等片；关于婚姻法的，有“婚姻法图解”、“结婚”等片。此外还有“中国共产党三十年”、“新中国第一批女航空员”等片。所有幻灯片全部是五彩的。为了使幻灯放映工作服务于国家建设，该场准备于今年下半年度设立印刷厂和幻灯机制造工厂，大量生产幻灯片和幻灯机，随时改进技术，扩大供应范围。
     “文艺报”第十四号出版
    “文艺报”本年第十四号已在二十五日出版。
    “可爱的中国”“绞索套着脖子时的报告”“卓娅和舒拉的故事”“我的儿子”和“刘胡兰小传”等作品，已广泛流传在中国读者中间，特别为青年学生所欢迎。青年团上海市工委宣传部和上海市学联并曾联合介绍这些作品作为青年学生暑假期间的选读书籍。本期“文艺报”发表的“文学作品在培养青年新道德新品质上的作用”（作者苏平）一文，对这些作品的思想内容作了综合的评述，帮助读者更好地理解这些作品。
    “西游记”是广大群众所喜爱的民间神话故事之
    一。它的不少情节曾被编写为许多不同形式的戏剧在各地上演，其中以“闹天宫”（原名“安天会”）最受欢迎。今年春天在北京演出的魏晨旭写的“新闹天宫”一剧，是根据“闹天宫”改编的。由于剧作者对待民族戏曲遗产缺乏认真负责的严肃态度和正确的观点，“新闹天宫”一剧产生了许多原则性的错误。“文艺报”发表的“严肃地对待民族的戏曲遗产”（作者马彦祥）一文，对这剧本所存在的一些根本性的错误，特别关于剧作者的反历史主义观点，进行了具体的分析和批判。
    关于文学的现实主义问题，“文艺报”曾收到不少读者提出问题要求解答。“文艺报”本期发表了冯雪峰的“中国文学中从古典现实主义到无产阶级现实主义的发展的一个轮廓”一文中“中国文学的古典现实主义是怎么样的？”一节，首先对文学上的两个基本潮流——现实主义和浪漫主义的内容以及现实主义和积极的浪漫主义之间的关系，作了论述，具体指出从文学发展史看来，人类各民族文学的基本精神及其主潮是现实主义。并进而对中国在封建社会从“诗经”时代到鸦片战争中间三个时期的古典现实主义文学作了轮廓的评述。这篇文章的其它四节将陆续在“文艺报”发表。
    “关于创造新英雄人物问题的讨论”，本期“文艺报”继续发表了两篇文章。“文艺报”本年第九期所提出的这一问题的讨论，目前已在逐渐广泛展开和深入中。
