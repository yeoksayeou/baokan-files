    Hongshan Mine No. 84 Tunneling Team Successfully Employs Ma Liuhai Method
    Li Hongfan
    The superiority of the multi-hole cyclic tunneling method of the Ma Liuhai team of Datong Coal Mine has been widely recognized. However, can the operation method of the Ma Liuhai team only be implemented in Datong Coal Mine where the coal seam thickness is suitable and the objective conditions are good? This question has been answered in the negative by the No. 84 Tunneling Team of the No. 3 Well of Hongshan Coal Mine, Shandong Mining Bureau.
    The No. 84 Tunneling Team creatively applied the experience of the Ma Liuhai team, actively overcame difficulties, and finally implemented three-hole cyclic operation in a thin coal seam with half coal and half rock, greatly improving the tunneling progress and efficiency. In December of last year, when cyclic operation was not implemented, the daily progress of the main roadway was only 77 meters, and the efficiency per worker was 1.086 cubic meters. After learning the multi-hole cyclic operation method, the progress has reached 15 to 16 meters per day, and the average efficiency per worker in a round shift is 1.8 cubic meters. The utilization rate of machinery has also been greatly improved.
    The coal seam of No. 3 Well is only one meter thick, with 0.2 meters of natural coke, 0.15 meters of gangue, and irregular lenticular iron sulfide. There are many difficulties in implementing cyclic operation under these conditions. For example, because the coal seam is too thin, the progress of roadways with rock bottoms is different from those without rock bottoms, which affects cyclic operation. At the same time, coal seams and rocks must be blasted separately, which complicates labor organization and operating procedures.
    The situation of the No. 84 Tunneling Team itself was also not good. Due to insufficient cultivation and assistance from the leadership in the past, the labor organization was chaotic before the promotion work began, various necessary work systems were not established, the three shifts were not united, and the tunneling progress was very slow. At the beginning of implementing cyclic operation, the workers' thinking was not clear. Everyone was accustomed to working together in a mixed way, fearing that fixed job positions would affect unity, and that the division of labor would be inappropriate.
    The leaders of Shandong Mining Bureau and Hongshan Mine were determined to overcome various difficulties, help the No. 84 Tunneling Team implement various necessary reforms, learn from the experience of the Ma Liuhai team, and implement cyclic operation.
    The comrades responsible for assisting the team in promotion explained the benefits of clear division of labor and fixed job positions to the workers from all aspects, and then took into account the workers' labor intensity and technical abilities, and divided the job positions; in each job position, they assigned different responsibilities according to each person's different technical level; in simple job positions, they adopted the method of rotating operations to make the amount of labor each worker puts in roughly equal. The administrative and trade union departments also unified the leadership of the three shifts, educating workers to establish an overall concept, laying the foundation for the implementation of cyclic operation.
    In addition to mobilizing education and carrying out other preparatory work, Hongshan Mine had to overcome a specific difficulty. Because the coal seam was too thin, in the main roadway, it was necessary to dig more than one meter of rock under the coal seam, otherwise the roadway would be too short, making it difficult for workers to operate, which would affect the progress of tunneling and mining. Especially the air roadway and cross-cut, because they are only used as return air roadways and are generally not very useful during mining, if they are also dug with rock bottoms, the cost would be too high; if they are not dug with rock bottoms, the air roadway and cross-cut would be too short, making it difficult for workers to operate, and the progress would not be able to keep up with the main roadway, and the ventilation of the main roadway would be affected.
    In March, the technical personnel and workers who were helping with the promotion worked together and finally found a way to overcome this difficulty. They decided to change the layout of the roadways and the ventilation method, cancel the air roadway and cross-cut, and use a combined air roadway for return air. That is, widen 1.5 meters in the coal seam next to the roadway, and then put dense pillars along the outer edge and smear it with yellow mud. This channel replaces the cross-cut and air roadway and serves as the return air roadway for the main roadway. After adopting this method, not only the ventilation problem of the main roadway tunneling was solved and the difficulties of excavating the air roadway and cross-cut were solved, but also when mining in the future, the wooden pillars can be fully recovered, and the coal pillars can be kept without loss, improving the recovery rate.
    After adopting the combined air roadway ventilation and canceling the air roadway and cross-cut, the layout of the roadways is no longer the parallel arrangement of the main roadway and the air roadway, with cross-cuts connecting them, but the three roadways of Lunzipo North Fourth Groove, Lunzipo South Fourth Groove, and Lunzipo Heading cross each other in a cross shape. They reasonably organized the drilling workers (including those who drill rock and those who drill coal seams), rock mucking workers, coal seam mucking workers, and shed supporting and road laying workers in these three roadways to implement cyclic operation. Each cycle is two and a half hours, and each shift can cycle three times. In order to increase the tunneling progress, the workers also constantly studied and worked hard on drilling technology. They adopted the method of filling the cannon mud completely and thoroughly removing the coal powder and rock powder in the gun bore, and implemented two-meter deep-hole blasting in the thin coal seam.
    To implement cyclic operation, each job position must be closely connected, and the entire production process must be orderly. To this end, the No. 84 Tunneling Team established seven necessary systems. The main ones are: safety responsibility system, operation responsibility system, and job position on-site handover system, etc. These systems are a powerful guarantee for the regular progress of cyclic operation.
    After the No. 84 Tunneling Team implemented regular cyclic operation, the work outlook has greatly changed. In the past, workers waited for work assignments after going to work, but now they carry out work according to the instruction chart in a planned way, consciously abide by labor discipline, scientifically grasp operation time, and strive to study technology.
    However, there are still some problems in the No. 84 Tunneling Team that need to be solved urgently. The first is that coal powder and rock powder fill the palm surface, which seriously affects the health of workers and is very unfavorable to work. The leadership should promptly study effective methods to prevent coal and rock powder from flying. The second is that the wage system is unreasonable. At present, the No. 84 Tunneling Team still adopts an unreasonable average wage system. The leadership should seize the implementation of the eight-level wage system to stimulate the workers' labor enthusiasm.

    洪山矿八四掘进队采用马六孩作业法成功
    李宏范
    大同煤矿马六孩小组多孔道循环掘进作业法的优越性，已为众所公认。但是，马六孩小组的作业方法，是否只有在大同煤矿那样煤层厚度适宜，客观条件良好的情况下才能实行呢？这个问题，已由山东矿务局洪山煤矿山三井八四掘进队作了否定的回答。
    八四掘进队在学习马六孩小组的经验中发挥了创造性，积极主动地克服困难，终于在半煤半岩的薄煤层中实行了三孔道循环作业，大大地提高了掘进的进度和效率。去年十二月份没有实行循环作业时，每日正巷进度才七十七公尺，每工效率为一点零八六立方公尺。学习多孔道循环作业法后进度已达每日十五至十六公尺，一圆班合计平均每工效率为一点八立方公尺。机械的利用率也大大提高了。
    山三井的煤层只有一公尺厚，里面还夹有零点二公尺的天然焦、零点一五公尺的夹石和不成层里的卵形硫化铁。在这种条件下实行循环作业是有很多困难的。比如，因为煤层太薄，打岩石底的巷道和不打岩石底的巷道进度不同，影响循环作业。同时，煤层和岩石要分别爆破，劳动组织和操作程序因而也比较复杂。
    八四掘进队本身的情况也不够好。由于领导方面过去对他们的培养帮助不够，在推广工作开始以前，劳动组织混乱，各种必要的工作制度没有建立，三班彼此不团结，掘进进度很慢。在开始实行循环作业时，工人们的思想还都搞不通，大家习惯于一伙子混着干活，怕固定工种后各干各的影响团结，还怕分工分得不恰当。
    山东矿务局和洪山矿的领导方面，决心克服各种困难，帮助八四掘进队实行各种必要的改革，学习马六孩小组的经验，实行循环作业。
    负责帮助该队进行推广工作的同志，从各方面向工人说明明确分工固定工种的好处，而后照顾到工人的劳动强度和技术能力，划分了工种；在各工种中又根据各人不同的技术水平，使其分别担负不同的责任；在操作简单的工种中，则采取轮换作业的方式使每个工人所付出的劳动量大体相等。行政和工会方面也都统一了三班的领导，教育工人树立整体观念，为实行循环作业打下基础。
    除了动员教育和进行其它准备工作而外，在洪山矿却还必须克服一个具体的困难。因为煤层太薄，在正巷中，必须在煤层下再打一公尺多厚的岩石，否则巷道过矮，工人操作困难，影响掘进和回采的进度。特别是风巷和横管，因为只是作为回风巷道，在回采时一般用处不大，假使也打岩石底，则成本太高；如果不打岩石底，风巷和横管又太矮，工人操作困难，进度无法赶上正巷，正巷通风便要受到影响。
    三月份中，帮助进行推广工作的技术人员和工人共同努力，终于找出了克服这个困难的办法。他们决定改变巷道的布置和通风办法，取消风道和横管，改用夹风道回风。就是在巷道旁边的煤层内开宽一点五公尺，然后在外沿打上密集支柱，用黄泥抹实，这一孔道就代替了横管和风巷，作为正巷的回风道。采用这个办法后，不但解决了正巷掘进的通风问题和开掘风巷和横管的困难，将来回采时，木柱可以全部回收，还可以不丢失煤柱，提高回采率。
    采用夹风道通风取消风巷和横管后，巷道的布置也不再是正巷和风巷平行，中间由横管贯通的办法，而是轮子坡北四顺槽、轮子坡南四顺槽及轮子坡迎头三个巷道十字交叉。他们把打眼工（包括打岩石的和打煤层的）、岩石扒装工、煤层扒装工以及支棚、铺路工等合理地组织在这三个巷道内实行循环作业。每循环一次为二小时半，每班可以循环三次。为了增加掘进进度，工人们在打眼技术方面也不断钻研努力。他们采用了炮泥装满装实，炮眼内的煤粉岩粉掏尽吹尽的办法，在薄煤层内实行了二公尺的深孔爆破。
    实行循环作业必须各工种紧密衔接，整个生产过程有条不紊。为此，八四掘进队建立了七种必要的制度。其中主要的有：保安责任制、操作专责制以及工种现场交接班制等。这些制度是循环作业正规进行的有力保证。
    八四掘进队在实行了正规的循环作业以后，工作面貌已经大大改变。工人们过去上了班后就等着派活干，现在则是按指示图表有计划地进行工作，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，科学地掌握操作时间，并且努力钻研技术。
    但是，八四掘进队在目前也还有一些问题急须解决。第一是煤粉岩粉飞满掌子面，严重影响工人健康，对工作也非常不利。领导方面应该及时研究出防止煤岩粉飞扬的有效办法。第二是工资制度不合理。现在八四掘进队仍然采用不合理的大平均的工资制度，领导方面应抓紧实行八级工资制，以刺激工人的劳动积极性。
