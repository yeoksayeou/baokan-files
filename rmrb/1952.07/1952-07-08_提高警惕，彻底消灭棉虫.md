    Raise Vigilance and Completely Eliminate Cotton Pests
    Zeng Zhaohui
    Farmers in all cotton-producing areas across the country are waging a determined struggle against various cotton pests.
    The occurrence of cotton pests this year is earlier than in previous years. The cotton pests already discovered in various regions include cotton aphids, red spiders, cutworms, thrips, mirid bugs, boll weevils, snails, and others. Among them, cotton aphids are the most widespread and serious. Red spiders are also very rampant in some individual areas. Areas with various cotton pests include seventeen provinces and regions: Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangxi, eastern Liaoning, western Liaoning, northern Sichuan, and Guizhou.
    The leadership organs in many regions are paying close attention to eliminating cotton pests. Organized pest control movements have rapidly unfolded in various places. Chenliu Special District in Henan Province mobilized 850,000 people for manual control of cotton aphids. After the implementation of emergency aphid control in Handan Special District, Hebei Province, aphid damage has been greatly reduced. Cheng'an County in the special district mobilized 190,000 people to participate in the aphid control movement. In order to prevent and control red spiders, Yuanshi County in Shijiazhuang Special District sold 10,000 jin of sulfur powder in three or four days. Before the wheat harvest, Pingyuan Province mobilized 269,000 people for a comprehensive treatment of cotton pests. As cotton pests are now rampant again in the province, the Provincial People's Government has instructed all regions to immediately mobilize the masses after the wheat harvest to jointly prepare pesticides and implement timely control. All cotton fields in Laiyang Special District and Gaomi County in Shandong Province were universally treated for pests once before the wheat harvest. Farmers in Wuqiao County have launched four rounds of concentrated weeding and aphid prevention in cotton fields. Leading cadres, including county heads and district heads in Sanyuan and Liquan Counties in Shaanxi Province, have successively gone to the countryside to lead pest control, powerfully promoting the pest control movement. Farmers in Taicang County in southern Jiangsu launched a pest control competition, which has been very effective. Various counties in southern Sichuan Province have launched a pest control movement. The Panlong District in Nanbu County organized patriotic production-increasing pest-killing teams, capturing 713,000 cutworms.
    Various cotton pests still pose a great threat to a bumper cotton harvest, and the pest infestation in many areas shows an upward trend. All regions must be highly vigilant against this situation. At present, the following issues urgently need to be resolved in pest control work:
    1. Many cadres are still negligent and careless about pest control work. Some regions did not promptly prepare pesticides after receiving agricultural pesticide loans for cotton pest control, but instead accumulated the funds, and even diverted them. For example, Pingyuan Province still has 3.1 billion yuan in agricultural pesticide loans remaining, and the loans allocated to various special districts are mostly accumulated in banks, without timely storage of agents. They believe that the masses still have native tobacco for pest control, so they do not promptly allocate agricultural pesticide loans to the counties. Similar situations also exist in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces.
    Many people think "there are still few pests, it doesn't matter," or they don't believe that aphids can occur so early. Therefore, the slogan of "comprehensive treatment once before the wheat harvest" for aphids issued by many regions has not been truly realized. Various places in Hebei Province were busy with locust control and wheat appraisal work, so they did not universally treat aphids before the wheat harvest.
    Some people developed new complacency after achieving some results. Some county and district leaders in Handan Special District, Hebei, blindly believed that "aphids will not cause disaster again" after treating cotton pests once. The supply section chief of the Anyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province also had this idea. He said at a meeting: "Aphids have been eliminated, it doesn't matter." In fact, the pest damage is still serious, and the masses urgently need pesticides and machinery, but the county supply and marketing cooperative has accumulated a lot of pesticides and machinery without selling them.
    2. The problem of pesticide supply: Many cooperatives and agricultural departments do not have close contact. Some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives in Shaanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, and other provinces do not understand the pest situation or technology, but blindly promote pesticides; agricultural departments have adopted an indifferent attitude towards this situation, so that after the masses buy pesticides, they do not know how to use them. Some provincial cooperatives have poor contact with grassroots cooperatives. The provincial cooperatives do not understand the pesticide reserves of the grassroots cooperatives, and cannot supply them in time. For example, the pesticide figures grasped by provincial cooperatives in Hebei, Pingyuan, and other provinces when ordering plans differ greatly from the actual situation. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative estimated that the province's pesticide reserves are sufficient for a comprehensive treatment of aphids twice in one-quarter of the cotton fields, but the pesticides stored by the Handan Special District Cooperative can only complete 45 percent of the planned figures. Individual cooperative cadres also have a purely profit-seeking perspective. They believe that operating pesticides and machinery is obligatory, without profit, is a "burden," and they are afraid of losing money. For example, the Agricultural Supply Cooperative in Handan Special District, Hebei Province, has accumulated a large number of pesticides and machinery, waiting for buyers to come to their door to sell at high prices, instead of actively promoting them. When cotton aphids were serious in Qiuxian County, the supply of tobacco leaves could not keep up, and the grassroots cooperatives in Qiuxian County took the opportunity to raise the price of tobacco leaves.
    3. Several deviations occurred in technology promotion. The Sanyuan Workstation of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry once promoted the "hand-pinching method" in the Sanyuan and Jingyang areas to control red spiders. Because there was no prior test, it was blindly promoted, resulting in wasted manpower, damaged cotton leaves, and the pest damage was not reduced, creating a bad influence among the masses. In Gangshang Village, Yexian County, Pingyuan Province, due to poor medicine preparation and spraying techniques, although it has been treated three to six times, aphids are still developing. The morale of the masses is low, and they even regret planting cotton.
    Cotton pests are still developing in various places, and leading cadres in all cotton-producing areas must, without exception, regard pest control as the most important work at present. Agricultural departments must establish close contact with supply and marketing cooperatives, actively help cooperatives to do a good job in the promotion of pesticides and machinery, launch a technology transfer movement, so that pesticides, machinery and technology can be correctly grasped by the cotton farmers in a timely manner.
    Pest control is a decisive battle in cotton-producing areas. Only by winning this battle can we guarantee a bumper cotton harvest this year.

    提高警惕，彻底消灭棉虫
    曾昭慧
    全国各棉产区农民正对各种棉虫进行坚决的斗争。
    今年棉花害虫发生的时间，比往年为早。现在各地已经发现的棉花害虫，有棉蚜、红蜘蛛、地老虎、蓟马、盲桩象、象鼻虫、蜗牛等。其中以棉蚜为最普遍最严重。红蜘蛛在个别地区也很猖獗。发生各种棉虫的地区，有河北、平原、山西、陕西、山东、河南、皖南、皖北、苏南、苏北、浙江、湖北、江西、辽东、辽西、川北、贵州等十七省区。
    很多地区的领导机关，对于扑灭棉虫十分注意。有组织的治虫运动，已在各地迅速展开。河南省陈留专区动员了八十五万个人工防治棉蚜。河北省邯郸专区实行紧急治蚜后，蚜害已经大大减轻。该专区成安县发动了十九万人，参加治蚜运动。石家庄专区元氏县为了防治红蜘蛛，在三、四天内就推销了一万斤硫磺粉。平原省在麦收前，动员了二十六万九千多人，普治棉虫一遍。该省棉虫现在又猖獗起来，省人民政府已指示各地，在麦收后立即发动群众，合伙配药，及时除治。山东省莱阳专区和高密县的全部棉田，都在麦收前普遍治虫一次。吴桥县农民在棉田里突击除草防蚜，先后已有四次。陕西省三原、醴泉等县的县长、区长领导干部，先后下乡领导治虫，有力地推动了防虫运动。苏南太仓县农民开展了治虫竞赛，收效很大。川北南部各县展开了除虫运动，南部县盘龙区组织了爱国增产杀虫大队，捉获地老虎七十一万三千条。
    各种棉虫对棉花丰产的威胁仍然很大，不少地区的虫害且有上升的趋势。对于这种情况，各地必须予以高度警惕。目前在除虫工作中，有以下几个问题急待解决：
    一、许多干部对除虫工作还是麻痹大意。有的地区得到治棉虫的农药贷款以后，并没有及时准备农药，而是把款积压起来，甚至发生了挪用的现象。如平原省农药贷款尚余三十一亿元，分到各专区的贷款，多积压在银行里，未及时贮备药剂。他们认为群众手中还有治虫的土烟，就不及时地把农药贷款拨到各县。在河南、河北、陕西、山西等省，也有类似的情况。
    许多人认为“虫子还少，不要紧”，或不相信这么早就能发生蚜虫。因此，很多地区发出的“麦收前除治一遍”蚜虫的口号，并未真正实现。河北省各地忙于治蝗和小麦评比工作，就没有在麦收前普治蚜虫。
    有些人在获得一些成绩后，产生了新的麻痹思想。河北邯郸专区有些县区的领导干部，除治一次棉虫后，就盲目地认为“蚜虫不致再成灾了”。平原省安阳县供销合作社供应科长也有这种思想，他在大会上说：“蚜虫已消灭，不要紧了。”事实上虫害仍是严重的，群众急需药械，而县供销合作社却积压了很多药械没有出卖。
    二、农药的供应问题：许多地区的合作社和农业部门，没有紧密的联系。陕西、河北、平原等省有些供销合作社的干部，既不了解虫害情况，又不懂得技术，而是盲目地推销农药；农业部门对于这种情况，采取了漠不关心的态度，以致群众买到农药后，不知怎样使用。有些省合作社和基层社的联系很差，省社不了解基层社的农药贮备量，无法及时供应。例如，河北、平原等省社订计划时所掌握的药剂数字，和实际情况相差甚远。河北省供销合作总社估计该省药剂准备量，足够在四分之一的棉田中普治两次蚜虫，但邯郸专区社所存药剂，仅能完成计划数字的百分之四十五。个别合作社干部还有单纯营利观点，他们认为经营药械是义务性的，没有利润，是“负担”，怕赔款。例如，河北省邯郸专区农业供应社积压了大批药械，等待买主上门以高价出售，而不主动推销。邱县棉蚜严重时，烟叶供应不上，邱县基层合作社竟乘机抬高烟叶价格。
    三、技术推广发生了若干偏差。陕西省农林厅三原工作站曾在三原、泾阳一带推广“手捏法”，除治红蜘蛛。由于事前没有试验，就盲目加以推广，结果浪费了人力，损伤了棉叶，而虫害并未减轻，在群众中造成了不良的影响。平原省邺县岗上村防治蚜虫，因配药和喷射技术不好，虽然治过三遍到六遍，但蚜虫还在发展。群众情绪低落，甚至后悔不该种棉花。
    各地棉虫还在发展，各棉区的领导干部，必须无例外地把防治虫害当做目前最重要的工作。农业部门必须和供销合作社取得密切联系，积极帮助合作社做好药械的推广工作，展开技术传授运动，使药械和技术能及时为棉农群众所正确掌握。
    防治棉虫是棉产区的一场决定性的战斗，只有取得这个战斗的胜利，才能保证今年棉花的丰收。
