Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Paris News: French Communist Party Central Committee Member, "l'Humanité" Editor-in-Chief, and writer Stie was released from prison by the Paris Court of Appeal's Investigation Chamber on the evening of the 18th.

Stie was unreasonably arrested and imprisoned by the French government on May 25th for publishing an article in "l'Humanité" calling on the people to participate in the May 28th demonstration protesting Ridgway's arrival in Paris.

The Investigation Chamber decided to temporarily release Stie. According to Parisian newspapers, the French government is still unwilling to admit defeat and will continue to accuse Stie of "plotting to endanger national security" and "inciting violence." However, even the United Press said: "The court's action indicates that the government has suffered a new setback in opposing the second most powerful Communist Party in Western Europe."

    法政府反共行为再次失败
    法共中委斯梯出狱
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：法国共产党中央委员会委员、“人道报”总编辑、作家斯梯已经在十八日晚由巴黎上诉法院侦察庭释放出狱。
    斯梯是因为在“人道报”发表文章号召人民参加五月二十八日抗议李奇微抵巴黎的示威而于五月二十五日被法国政府无理逮捕下狱的。
    侦察庭决定暂时释放斯梯。据巴黎报纸指出：法国政府仍然不甘心失败，还要控诉斯梯犯有“图谋危害国家治安”和“煽动暴行”罪。但是，连合众社都说：“法院的行动表示政府在反对西欧第二个强大的共产党遭受到新的挫折。”
