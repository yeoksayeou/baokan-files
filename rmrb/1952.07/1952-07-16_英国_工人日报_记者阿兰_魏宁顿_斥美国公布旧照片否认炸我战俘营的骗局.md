    British "Daily Worker" Reporter Alan Winnington
    Denounces U.S. Deception of Releasing Old Photos to Deny Bombing of Our POW Camp
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 15th] According to a report from Kaesong by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London Daily Worker, on July 15th: The photos released by the U.S. in an attempt to show that POW Camp No. 9 was not damaged after the Friday air raid and to prove U.S. innocence cannot deceive anyone. The photos of the POW camp released by the U.S. were obviously taken before last Friday. When the contradictions in the American explanation of the bombing became too obvious, it became necessary to try the clever trick of using old photos to deceive the people of the West. First, they said that their pilots had difficulty finding the location of the POW camp because the POW camp did not have proper markings. This is a lie. They tried their best to tell the world that they only bombed military targets. The nearly seven thousand civilian casualties and over one hundred prisoners of war prove this is a lie. U.S. press officer Nokes hastily stated that the POW camp did not have proper markings, and after it was probably bombed, keen-eyed reporters noticed an even more astonishing contradiction—such a statement proved that the American bombing was indiscriminate and targeted a large area. Therefore, they hurriedly released old photos of the POW camp to the reporters—the Americans, on the one hand, said they could not find the location of the POW camp, but on the other hand, they took photos—to fabricate such an outrageous lie, saying that the POW camp was not attacked, when in fact more than one hundred prisoners of war were strafed by machine guns and bombed. Of course, when those photos were taken, the POW camp had not been bombed. But now they have revealed new flaws. It seems that when they need to deny the massacre of their own prisoners of war, American pilots can very easily find the location of the POW camp. Since the beginning of the negotiations, this clumsy act of perfidy has been a typical American tactic on issues such as the demarcation line, the bombing of Kaesong, germ warfare, forced screening, and numerous violations of the neutral zone agreement.

    英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿
    斥美国公布旧照片否认炸我战俘营的骗局
    【新华社十五日讯】据伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十五日自开城报道：美国企图说明第九号战俘营在星期五的空袭后未受损害并企图证明美国无辜的照片是欺骗不了任何人的。美方所公布的该战俘营的照片显然是上星期五以前照的。在美国人对轰炸的解释中矛盾太显明的时候，倒是有必要试用旧照片来欺骗西方人民的妙计。首先他们说他们的飞行员很不容易发觉俘虏营的所在，因为俘虏营没有设置适当标识。这是谎话。他们尽力想告诉全世界：他们只轰炸了军事目标。伤亡者几达七千平民和一百余俘虏就证明了这是谎话。美国新闻发布官纳科斯仓卒声明：俘虏营没有设置适当标识，大约可能被炸以后，眼光敏锐的新闻记者注意到了更惊人的矛盾——这样一个声明证明美国人的轰炸是盲目的，而且以很大地区作为目标。所以仓惶地向记者发表了旧的俘虏营照片——美国人一方面说找不到俘虏营的所在地，却又摄了照片——来胡诌这样一个漫天大谎，说俘虏营没有受到攻击，其实被机枪扫射的和被炸的俘虏在一百名以上。当然，在拍摄那些照片的时候，俘虏营还没有被炸。但是他们现在又露出了新的破绽。看来，当他们需要来否认屠杀他们自己的俘虏的时候，美国飞行员又能非常容易地发现俘虏营的所在了。自谈判开始以来，在分界线、轰炸开城、细菌战、强迫甄别和许多次破坏中立区协议等等问题上，这种笨拙的背信勾当一直是典型的美国方式。
