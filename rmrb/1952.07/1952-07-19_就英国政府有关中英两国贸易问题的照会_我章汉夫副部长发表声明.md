Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a statement on July 5th regarding the British government's memoranda of April 18th and May 19th concerning trade issues between China and the United Kingdom. The statement reiterated China's willingness to restore and develop international trade relations with the governments and peoples of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The statement solemnly pointed out that the British government's claim in the memoranda that British companies and manufacturers were encountering significant difficulties in China was entirely the bitter fruit of the British government's pursuit of the United States in implementing a hostile embargo policy against China. The "Note No. 53 on Sino-British Trade" referred to in Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu's statement is a note delivered by Mr. Lan Lainner, the British government's negotiation representative, to Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on April 18, 1952, inquiring about the Sino-British trade agreement signed at the Moscow International Economic Conference. The "Note No. 69 on the British Industrial and Commercial Businesses in China Intending to Close Their Businesses and Establish New Trade Organizations" referred to in Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu's statement is another note delivered by Mr. Lan Lainner to Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu on May 19, 1952. This note stated that almost all British companies in China were prepared to apply for the closure of their businesses, and several important British companies were planning to establish a new type of organization to maintain direct contact with the relevant Chinese authorities and continue trade with China, requesting consideration from the Central People's Government. In the note, Lan Lainner attributed the reasons for these British companies' preparation to close their businesses to the "increasing expansion" of Chinese state-owned institutions. It was said that this had made many British companies "relatively reduced the need to maintain the status quo." In addition, on May 20, British Foreign Secretary Eden also made a statement with similar arguments in the British House of Commons.

Statement by Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

The full text is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has received Note No. 53 on Sino-British trade dated April 18, 1952, and Note No. 69 on British industrial and commercial businesses in China intending to close their businesses and establish new trade organizations dated May 19, 1952, from Mr. Lan Lainner, the British government's negotiation representative, and has noted the relevant statement made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the British House of Commons on May 20. Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government deems it necessary to declare as follows:

(1) The Central People's Government has repeatedly declared that China is willing to restore and develop international trade relations with the governments and peoples of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; all foreign nationals and merchants in China who abide by the laws and decrees of the Chinese government can receive the protection of the people's governments at all levels. According to this policy of the Central People's Government, China's public and private trade institutions have been, and still are, striving to establish normal trade relations with foreign industrialists and businessmen.

Since October 1949, trade between China and the United Kingdom has undergone considerable restoration and development, and British merchants in China have become increasingly active. For more than two years, China's public and private trade institutions have successively signed various forms of trade contracts and processing order contracts with foreign industrialists and businessmen in China, mainly British industrialists and businessmen.

Recently, at the International Economic Conference held in Moscow this April, the Chinese delegation attending the conference and the British delegation reached a trade agreement for 1952 to conduct trade worth 10 million pounds each. On June 9, trade representatives from China and the United Kingdom signed the first batch of sales estimate contracts worth a total of 6.5 million pounds in Berlin, based on the above-mentioned agreement. These facts have fully demonstrated that the Chinese government and people are willing to develop normal trade relations between China and the United Kingdom on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

(2) However, the British government has consistently pursued a discriminatory policy towards trade with China, hindering the establishment of normal economic relations between the British people and the People's Republic of China. People should recall that since 1950, under constant pressure from the United States, the British government has taken a series of unfriendly control measures against the People's Republic of China in trade. On May 18, 1951, the British government representative voted in favor of the absurd proposal put forward by the United States at the United Nations General Assembly, which was manipulated and hijacked by the United States, to impose an embargo on the People's Republic of China. Then, on June 19, 1951, the British government announced that all exports to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong would be placed under special control. In this way, the British government followed the U.S. government in implementing hostile control and embargo policies against the People's Republic of China, deliberately hindering trade between China and the United Kingdom. Since then, the amount of trade between China and the United Kingdom has decreased sharply.

Under this trade policy of the British government, British industry and commerce have suffered significant difficulties that could have been avoided; especially many British companies and manufacturers in China, due to the shrinking and depression of trade between the two countries, coupled with their poor management methods, have caused many of them to fall into a situation where they have no choice but to contract and close down. In the past, they have waited anxiously. The people's governments at all levels of the People's Republic of China have also taken measures such as loans and the supply of raw materials to help them. However, the British government's control and embargo measures have shown no signs of relaxation, and the uncontrollable difficulties they have given them not only show no signs of easing, but also tend to increase.

The plight of British merchants in China is the bitter fruit of the British government's control and embargo policies. This alone can prove that the British government's pursuit of the United States to implement control and embargo measures against the People's Republic of China is contrary to and harms the interests of the British people.

(3) The people's governments at all levels shall continue to protect all British companies and manufacturers within the territory of the People's Republic of China as long as they abide by the laws and decrees of the Chinese government. If they voluntarily terminate their business, they may apply to the local people's governments for handling in accordance with the law, no matter what method they adopt to terminate their business. In the process of termination, if problems such as the dismissal of employees, application for departure from the country, and disposal of enterprises arise, they can be resolved legally and reasonably according to the specific circumstances.

(4) The Central People's Government believes that actively developing trade relations between China and the United Kingdom on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is conducive to the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production in both countries and to improving the living conditions of the people of both countries. Therefore, any British company and manufacturer, or its company and manufacturer within China, as well as groups jointly organized by British companies and manufacturers, as long as they do not harbor monopolistic intentions and are willing to trade with China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, can contact China's public and private trade institutions at any time to establish contact and hold specific business negotiations.

    就英国政府有关中英两国贸易问题的照会
    我章汉夫副部长发表声明
    【新华社十八日讯】我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长在七月五日就英国政府四月十八日及五月十九日有关中英两国间贸易问题的照会发表声明。声明重申中国愿与各外国的政府和人民在平等和互利的基础上恢复和发展国际间的通商贸易关系。声明严正指出，英国政府在照会中所谓的英国公司和厂商在中国遭遇到重大困难一事，完全是英国政府追随美国，实施敌视中国的管制禁运政策所给予他们的苦果。章汉夫副部长声明中所指的“关于中英贸易的第五十三号照会”，是一九五二年四月十八日，英国政府谈判代表蓝来讷先生送达我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长的一件照会，对在莫斯科国际经济会议上签订的中英贸易协议一事有所探询。章汉夫副部长声明中所指的“关于在华英国工商业拟结束业务并建立新的贸易机构的第六十九号照会”，是一九五二年五月十九日，蓝来讷先生送达章汉夫副部长的又一件照会。这一照会声称几乎全部在中国的英国公司均已准备申请结束业务，若干重要的英国公司正在筹划建立一个新型的组织，以便与有关的中国当局保持直接联系，继续进行对中国的贸易，要求我中央人民政府对此予以考虑。蓝来讷在照会中对于这些英国公司所以准备结束业务的原因归之于中国国营机构业务的“日益扩大”。据说，这样就使得许多英国公司“相对地减少了维持现状的需要”。此外，五月二十日，英国外交大臣艾登先生也在英国下议院发表了论点相似的声明。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长的声明
    全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部业已收悉英国政府谈判代表蓝来讷先生一九五二年四月十八日关于中英贸易的第五十三号照会以及一九五二年五月十九日关于在华英国工商业拟结束业务并建立新的贸易机构的第六十九号照会，并已注意到了英国外交大臣艾登先生五月二十日在英国下议院发表的有关的声明。中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长认为有必要声明如下：
    （一）中央人民政府曾经再三宣告：中国愿与各外国的政府和人民在平等和互利的基础上恢复与发展国际间的通商贸易关系；一切遵守中国政府的法令的在华外侨外商，都可得到各级人民政府的保护。根据中央人民政府的这个政策，中国的各公私贸易机构一直在、并且迄今仍在努力和各外国工商业者建立正常的贸易联系。
    中英两国间的贸易，自一九四九年十月以来，曾经有过相当大的恢复与发展，在华英商也随之而日趋活跃。两年多来，中国各公私贸易机构并曾和在华的外国工商业者，其中主要是英国工商业者，陆续订立过各种方式的贸易合同以及加工订货合同。
    最近，在本年四月举行于莫斯科的国际经济会议中，出席该会议的中国代表团与英国代表团曾达成了一九五二年内进行每方价值达一千万英镑的贸易协议。六月九日中英两方贸易谈判代表根据上述协议在柏林签订了总值六百五十万英镑的第一批售货估计合同。这些事实已经充分证明中国政府和人民是愿意发展中英之间的平等互利的正常贸易关系的。
    （二）然而，英国政府却一贯地执行对华贸易的歧视政策，阻碍英国人民与中华人民共和国建立正常的经济关系。人们当能回忆，自一九五○年开始，在美国不断的压力下，英国政府即已在贸易方面对中华人民共和国采取了一系列的不友好的管制措施。一九五一年五月十八日，英国政府代表在美国政府所操纵和劫持的联合国大会上，投票赞成美国所提对中华人民共和国实行禁运的荒谬提案。接着在一九五一年六月十九日，英国政府又公布把运往中华人民共和国及香港的一切出口货置于特许管制之下。英国政府就这样追随美国政府实行敌视中华人民共和国的管制和禁运政策，蓄意阻挠中英之间的贸易往来。自此以后，中英两国之间的贸易数额就骤然减削下来了。
    在英国政府的这种贸易政策之下，英国的工商业就遭受到了原可不必遭受的重大困难；特别是在中国的许多英国公司和厂商，因为两国间贸易的萎缩萧条，再加上他们经营方法的不善，就使他们中间不少单位陷于不能不收缩倒闭的困境中。在过去若干时期内，他们曾经焦闷地观望等待。中华人民共和国各级政府也曾采取了贷款、供应原料等办法来帮助他们。可是，英国政府的管制和禁运等措施，并无丝毫放松的迹象，其所给予他们的无法控制的困难，不仅毫无轻减的征兆，反而还有日渐增大的趋势。
    在华英商的困境是英国政府管制禁运政策所给予他们的苦果。仅仅这一点，就可以证明，英国政府追随美国来对中华人民共和国实行管制和禁运，是违背和损害英国人民的利益的。
    （三）在中华人民共和国境内的各英国公司厂商，只要他们遵守中国政府的法令，各级人民政府仍当予以保护。如果他们自愿结束其业务，则不论他们采取何种方式结束，都可向各地人民政府分别进行申请，由各地主管机关据情依法处理。在结束过程中，如果发生解雇职工、申请离境及企业处置等问题，均可各按具体情况，分别迅速得到合法合理的解决。
    （四）中央人民政府认为，在平等互利的基础上，积极开展中英两国之间的贸易关系，是有利于两国恢复与发展工农业生产、并改善两国人民生活条件的。因此，英国的任何公司和厂商，或其在中国境内的公司和厂商，以及由英国公司厂商所联合组织的团体，只要是不怀垄断企图而且愿意在平等互利的基础上与中国进行贸易的，都可以随时和中国的公私贸易机构进行接洽，建立联系，举行具体的业务谈判。
    一九五二年七月五日于北京
