	Co-operatives in Central-South China cotton-producing areas have pre-purchased over 86% of their planned cotton.
	By the 10th of this month, co-operatives in the cotton-producing areas of Central-South China had completed over 86% of their annual cotton pre-purchase plan. Co-operatives in various places have implemented the principle of credit pre-purchase as the main method, supplemented by sales pre-purchase. For example, in Jiangxi Province, the pre-purchase deposit paid by co-operatives accounted for only 6% of the total pre-purchase value. Co-operative pre-purchases of cotton have also solved many difficulties for cotton farmers. The physical goods prepaid to cotton farmers in Henan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces were all production and living materials such as fertilizer, grain, and cloth. According to incomplete statistics, these physical goods amounted to 107 billion yuan. At present, co-operatives at all levels in the cotton-producing areas of Central-South China are training technicians in flower inspection, accounting, and statistics. At the same time, they are renovating warehouses and adding cotton gins to prepare for the autumn purchase of new cotton. Ningxia Tan Sheep Production Increases
	The famous white fur-producing area of Ningxia Province has increased Tan sheep production this year. The white fur-producing area includes Ningxia City, Yongning, Helan, Yinchuan, Pingluo, Huinong and other counties and cities. The water and grass here are abundant, and herders mostly raise Tan sheep. Tan sheep have fine, white wool that is curly, light, warm and beautiful. In order to improve the quality of Tan sheep and increase their numbers in a planned way, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government has established a Tan Sheep Breeding Farm to carry out breeding of superior varieties. Herders in various places have also generally carried out the work of selecting and retaining superior breeds and eliminating inferior breeds. Therefore, the Tan sheep breeding rate in Pingluo, Huinong, Helan, Ningshuo and other places has exceeded the original plan by 20%. Helan County has achieved a situation where there is not a single impure or inferior breed of male sheep in the entire county.

    中南产棉区合作社预购棉花已达计划百分之八十六以上
    中南产棉区合作社到本月十日止已完成全年预购棉花计划的百分之八十六以上。各地合作社都贯彻了信用预购为主、赊销预购为辅的方针。例如：江西全省合作社支付的预购定金仅占预购总值百分之六。合作社预购棉花也解决了棉农不少困难。河南、江西、湖北三省预付给棉农的实物全部是肥料、粮食、布匹等生产、生活资料。据不完全统计，这些实物折款达一千零七亿元。现在中南产棉区各级合作社正在训练验花、会计、统计等技术人员，同时，修整仓库，添置轧花机，为秋后收购新棉作准备。宁夏滩羊产量增加
