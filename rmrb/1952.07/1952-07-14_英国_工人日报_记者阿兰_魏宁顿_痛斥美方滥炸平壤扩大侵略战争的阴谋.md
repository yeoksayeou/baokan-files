Xinhua News Agency, 13th: British "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 12th: The bombs dropped by the US military in the devastated city of Pyongyang yesterday were aimed at Paris, London, New York, and Moscow, with the aim of provoking another world war. People who witnessed the bombing in Pyongyang firsthand said that it was purely a terroristic attack, with no selection of military targets whatsoever. American officials openly admitted that this action was part of America's "tough" policy, and they threatened to use this policy to force Korea and China to submit to American demands or
"bear the consequences." I recently visited Pyongyang and I know that any rational person can understand with their common sense that Pyongyang has almost no military targets of any kind. Factories and supply centers have naturally been evacuated long ago. This air raid was specifically an attack on civilians—this air raid was carried out very intensely for an entire day. This bombing was carried out on an undefended city that had nothing but civilian residences. The world, which was once shocked by the German bombing of Coventry, England, would lose its conscience if it failed to take action against such a bombing that is many times more brutal. Coventry was at least an industrial city. The intention of the Americans is not difficult to understand. They have been implementing a policy of undermining all international laws regarding war, carrying out terrorist atrocities again and again. On the one hand, they are using Korea as a testing ground for expanding the war, and using the Korean War as a reason to expand the war. On the other hand, they are trying to normalize terrorist atrocities and make the destruction of international law a routine matter. The American side issued a public statement saying that the purpose of the new terror air raids is to force a showdown in negotiations, which is purely propaganda. They have been trying this method for a year, and they know very well that they cannot force the Korean and Chinese sides to accept their ultimatum with this method. They are preparing for more intense air raids, which is part of their overall policy of creating a situation here that will make peace impossible. In fact, the residents of Pyongyang are almost all women, children, and the elderly. The objects of the US's boasts of dropping 500,000 kilograms of high-explosive bombs, tens of thousands of liters of napalm, and firing many rockets and machine gun and cannon fire are these people. People who have not experienced such intense air raids should put themselves in the situation and think about what it was like at that time, how many women who lost their husbands and their children crawled on the ground, hoping that the bombs whistling down one after another would not hit them, or trying to wipe off the napalm burning on their bodies that was about to burn them alive, or dying with regret, worrying about how their children would be able to live independently. Unleashing such barbaric brutality is not permissible under international law even with military necessity as an excuse. And there is no military necessity here at all. If the Americans want peace, they can get peace here immediately. However, the Americans demand that they be allowed to tear up the Geneva Conventions and keep most of the prisoners of war in their hands, and demand that they violate the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions to conduct air raids, as the price of "American peace." These facts prove that concessions from the Korean and Chinese sides will not bring peace, but will only make the Americans more rampant. The price of peace for the Korean and Chinese sides is to uphold justice and international law. The US's indiscriminate bombing of Pyongyang will surely arouse the sense of justice of people all over the world, prompting them to take immediate action to defend peace and end this brutal war.

    痛斥美方滥炸平壤扩大侵略战争的阴谋
    【新华社十三日讯】据英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿十二日自板门店报道：美军昨天在残破的平壤市内所投掷的炸弹，也就是向着巴黎、伦敦、纽约和莫斯科投的，是以挑起另一次世界大战为目的的。这里有曾经亲眼在平壤看见轰炸情况的人说：那纯粹是一种恐怖性的袭击，根本就不选择什么军事目标。美国方面的人们也公开地承认这种行动是美国的“强硬”政策的一部分，他们扬言要借着这种政策迫使朝鲜和中国屈服于美国的要求或
    “承担后果”。我最近曾到平壤去，我知道任何有理性的人都能够凭着自己的常识了解：平壤几乎根本没有任何种类的军事目标。工厂和供应中心自然早已疏散了。这次空袭专门是对平民的袭击——这次空袭十分激烈地进行了整整一天。这次轰炸是对一个除了平民住宅以外毫无所有的不设防城市进行的。曾经因德国人对英国考文垂市的轰炸而震惊的世界，如果不能对这样更加残暴许多倍的轰炸采取行动，那末实在是丧失良知了。考文垂至少还是一个工业城市。美国人的用意是不难了解的。他们一直在执行着破坏关于战争的一切国际公法的政策，一次又一次地进行恐怖的暴行。他们一方面拿朝鲜作为扩大战争的试验场，拿朝鲜战争作为扩大战争的理由，另一方面试图使恐怖暴行正常化，使破坏国际公法的事成为例行之事。美国方面发表公开的声明说：新的恐怖空袭的目的在于强要在谈判中摊牌，这种说法纯粹是宣传。一年来，他们一直试用这种办法，他们十分了解他们用这种办法不能迫使朝中方面接受他们的最后通牒。他们在准备进行更猛烈的空袭，这是他们要在此间造成将使和平成为不可能的局势的总政策的一部分。事实上，平壤居民差不多都是妇孺和老人，美方吹嘘他们投掷了五十万公斤高度爆炸弹、数万公升黏性汽油，发射了许多火箭和机关枪大炮炮火的对象就是这些人们。不曾遭遇这样猛烈的空袭的人们应该设身处地想一想当时的情况，多少失去丈夫的妇女和她的孩子们爬在地上，希望接二连三呼哨着落下来的炸弹不要打中他们，或者想法拭去在他们身上燃烧着的、就要把他们活活烧死的黏性汽油，或者挂念着他们的孩子如何能够独立生活而抱恨死去。发泄这样野蛮的兽性即使是以军事必要作为藉口也是国际法所不容许的。而且在这里根本没有军事必要。如果美国人希望和平，在这里可以立即得到和平。但是，美国人要求让他们撕破日内瓦公约把大多数战俘扣留在他们手里，要求让他们违反海牙公约和日内瓦公约进行空袭，以作为“美国和平”的代价。这些事实证明，朝中方面的让步不会带来和平，只会使美国人更为猖狂。朝中方面的和平的代价是维护正义和国际法。美方滥炸平壤的举动一定会激起全世界人们的正义感，使他们立即采取行动保卫和平，结束这个残酷的战争。
