    A Young Man Working and Studying Part-Time
    A Letter to Comrade Gao Yubao
    Editor's Note: Since our newspaper published Comrade Gao Yubao's articles "Midnight Rooster Crows" and "How I Learned Culture and Writing," we have received letters to Comrade Gao Yubao from Comrades Tang Jinling, Wang Haixing, Ma Shixing, and others. In their letters, they all expressed their desire to learn from Comrade Gao Yubao. The following is Comrade Ma Shixing's letter.
    Respected Uncle Gao Yubao: I read your article in the People's Daily on June 8th and learned how you studied culture and writing. I was extremely moved. Because your family was poor, your mother couldn't agree to you going to school, so you ran away. Your mother chased you all the way to the river and held you, crying for a long time. When I saw this, tears welled up in my eyes. This was the "fate" of our vast working people in old China.
    Now, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, those who rode roughshod over the people have been overthrown, and the great working people have the right to learn culture. Like you, the hopes I held in the old society have been realized after liberation. I am now a handyman at Liqu Elementary School in Lingbao County, working and studying part-time. I am fourteen years old this year and have been at this school for over a year. I am very active in my studies. For the past two semesters, I have always been rated as an excellent model student in the school and have worn the "Study, Study, and Study Again" medal twice. Teachers and classmates love me very much and often encourage me, so my enthusiasm for learning is even higher.
    Uncle! You are truly a model of learning. You only went to school for a little over a month, and after dropping out, you were completely self-taught. You are truly a good Party member, with a strong spirit of overcoming difficulties. Your perseverance and determination are as strong as steel, and you have a good grasp of the weapon of self-criticism. Just think, an illiterate person who was like a blind man, after three or four years of self-study and the help of comrades, actually wrote a novel of two to three hundred thousand words! How can one not admire you! After your learning and writing experience was introduced in the newspaper, it greatly moved me again, and made me put even more effort into my studies.
    Now I have fifteen or sixteen teachers in front of me, and I must unite more closely with the teachers. If I find anything I don't understand, I will ask questions. Every day, in addition to completing my work tasks, I must grasp the time even more tightly and learn from your spirit of learning. At the same time, I also hope that you will continue to uphold your spirit of learning and carry it forward. Listen to Chairman Mao's words of "guard against arrogance and rashness." I hope you will publish your novel as soon as possible so that everyone can see a book written by the working people themselves.
    I wish you even greater progress in your studies!
    Ma Shixing, handyman at Liqu Elementary School, Lingbao County

### 一个半工半读的少年  给高玉宝同志的一封信

    一个半工半读的少年
    给高玉宝同志的一封信
    编者按：本报自发表高玉宝同志的“半夜鸡叫”和“我是怎样学习文化和学习写作的”两篇文章以后，收到唐金陵、王海星、马世兴等同志写给高玉宝同志的信。他们在信中都表示要向高玉宝同志学习。下面就是马世兴同志的信。
    敬爱的高玉宝叔叔：我在六月八日人民日报上读了你的文章，知道你是怎样学习文化和学习写作的。我受了极大的感动。你母亲因家庭贫苦，不能答应你读书，你就往外跑，母亲追你一直追到河边，抱上你哭了半天。我看到这里，眼泪就暗暗地流下来了。这就是咱们广大劳动人民在旧中国的“命运”。
    现在在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，那些骑在人民头上撒尿的家伙被打倒了，伟大的劳动人民群众有了学文化的权利。我也和你一样，在旧社会里所抱的希望，在解放后实现了。我现在就在李曲完全小学当工友，半工半读。我今年十四岁，到这个学校有一年多了。我学习很积极。我两学期来，总是被评为全校甲等模范，胸前戴过两次“学习，学习，再学习”的奖章，老师同学都很热爱我，时常鼓励我，所以我的学习情绪更高涨起来了。
    叔叔！你真是一个学习模范，你仅仅上了一个多月的学，失学后你完全是自修。你真是一个好的党员，克服困难的精神真强，你的恒心决心如同钢铁一样，你的自我批评武器掌握的真好。你想想，一个不识字的睁眼瞎子，经三四年的自修及同志们的帮助，竟写成了二三十万字的小说，怎能不令人敬佩！你的学习写作经过在报上介绍后，又大大地感动了我，使我学习上更加上了一把劲。
    现在我有十五六位老师在跟前，我一定要和老师们更亲密地团结在一起，发现什么不懂就问，每日除了完成我的工作任务之外，还要把时间更紧地抓在手里，学习你的学习精神。同时我也希望你继续坚持你的学习精神，而且把它发扬光大。要听毛主席说的“戒骄戒躁”的话。希望你把你写的小说早日出版，让大家看看劳动人民自己写的书。
    祝你学习更进步！
    灵宝县李曲完全小学工友    马世兴
