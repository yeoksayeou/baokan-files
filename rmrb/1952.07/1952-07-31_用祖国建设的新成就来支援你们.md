Use New Achievements in National Construction to Support You
Industrial Labor Model Su Changyou

The 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is here. As I welcome this great festival, I recall my first meeting with commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. That was when Kaiyuan had just been liberated. The Second Company of a certain unit entered Kaiyuan and needed someone to repair the stoves temporarily. At that time, the people, who had been ravaged by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit army for a long time, were afraid to approach anyone in military uniform. When the People's Liberation Army comrades looked for someone to help them repair the stoves, some people were afraid to go. I took my trowel and went. When I arrived at a large courtyard, I saw eighteen large pots and a pile of broken bricks. The administrator comrade said, "These pots will be used to cook in two hours!" It was indeed not an easy task to build eighteen stove platforms in two hours. However, because they, from the company commander down, all participated in the labor, carrying bricks and pounding ash, everyone was happily working together; I also lowered my head and worked hard, and as a result, in less than two hours, eighteen stove platforms were built. In the evening, the company used the new stoves to cook, and the company commander even invited me to a meal. Before I left, he gave me four days' worth of wages.

This meeting during labor left a deep impression on me. At first, I thought: they are so brave in battle, but they also love the people and love labor so much; they have iron-like discipline, and they quickly became one with the people. This is truly a groundbreaking and good army! Later, I gradually understood that these are the characteristics of the people's army, the army led by the Communist Party and the working class. These became the beginning of my understanding of the Party and approaching the Party. And it became one of the sources of strength that encouraged me to serve the motherland. In my future work, whenever I encountered difficulties, I thought of those thousands upon thousands of lovely heroes. I thought: Why could Dong Cunrui sacrifice himself to blow up the bunker? And why could volunteer soldier Luo Shengjiao sacrifice himself to save a Korean child? All of this gave me a common understanding: they possess and display the noble qualities of the working class, are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the class and the people, and are willing to dedicate everything to the liberation cause of the motherland and mankind.

Their heroic actions educated and inspired me. I want to follow the path they have taken and dedicate myself to the cause of building the motherland without fear.

When commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, I would like to express to the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army: Learn from the spirit of the Liberation Army in fighting north and south, defeating Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit army, and learn from the spirit of the Volunteer Army in fighting the American aggressor army on the Korean battlefield. In the cause of building the motherland, continuously improve work efficiency, use production achievements to support you, and use the achievements of national construction to support you. Let us jointly dedicate our greatest strength to the great cause of defending world peace and building a better future for mankind!

    用祖国建设的新成就来支援你们
    工业劳动模范  苏长有
    中国人民解放军诞生二十五周年纪念日来到了。在迎接这伟大节日的时候，我回想起了我第一次和人民解放军指战员们会见时的情景。那是在开原刚解放的时候。某部二连进驻开原，临时要找人修炉灶。当时，被日寇和国民党匪军长期蹂躏的人民，看见穿军服的就不敢接近。当解放军同志找人去帮助他们修炉灶时，有的人不敢去。我拿着瓦刀去了。到了一个大院里，见那儿有十八口大锅和一堆碎砖。管理员同志说：“两个钟头后就要用这些锅做饭呀！”两个钟头要砌好十八个锅台，的确不是一件容易的事。可是，因为他们从连长起，人人动手参加劳动，抱砖的抱砖，捣灰的捣灰，大伙七手八脚干得挺欢；我也低下头一股劲砌，结果不到两个钟头，十八个锅台都砌起了。晚上连里用新炉灶煮了饭，连长还请我吃了一顿，临走给了我四个工的工钱。
    这次在劳动中的会见，给我留下了很深的印象。最初，我这样想：他们打仗是那么英勇，可是他们又是那么爱老百姓，爱劳动；他们有钢铁一样的纪律，很快就和老百姓打成了一片。这真是开天辟地的好军队呀！以后我逐渐了解，这些都是人民的军队，共产党、工人阶级领导下的军队的特点。这些就成为我认识党、靠近党的开始。而且成为鼓励我为祖国服务的力量的源泉之一。在以后的工作中，每当我遇到困难的时候，我就想起了那千千万万可爱的英雄。我想：董存瑞为啥能舍身炸碉堡？志愿军战士罗盛教又为啥能舍身救朝鲜小孩？这一切给了我一个共同的认识：他们具备和显示了工人阶级的高贵品质，忠于祖国，忠于阶级和人民，愿意为祖国、为人类的解放事业献出自己的一切。
    他们的英雄行为教育和激发了我，我要遵循他们所走过的道路，不畏一切地献身建设祖国的事业。
    当纪念“八一”建军节时，我谨向人民解放军和志愿军表示：学习解放军南征北战、打败日本帝国主义和国民党匪军的精神，学习志愿军在朝鲜战场上打击美国侵略军的精神，在祖国的建设事业中，不断地提高工作效率，用生产成绩来支援你们，用祖国建设的成就来支援你们。让我们共同在保卫世界持久和平、建设人类未来的美好事业中，献出最大的力量！
