    Ceasefire Negotiations Have Reached Their First Anniversary, Korean Peace Hangs by a Thread
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 10th] Special correspondent of this agency reports: Today marks the first anniversary of the ceasefire negotiations, and Korean peace hangs by a thread.
    The administrative meeting has been going on for a week, and whether the negotiations will succeed or fail now depends on its outcome. The task of the administrative meeting is to reach an agreement that meets the requirements of both parties on how to verify the lists of prisoners of war and exchange them. After General Nan Ri agreed to the wording of Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war detained by both sides, this is the only remaining issue on the negotiating table. If this problem can be resolved, the armistice agreement can be signed as soon as the administrative details and the wording of Article 63 of the draft are finalized.
    As long as the US representatives abide by the agreed principles and no longer insist on unacceptable demands to sabotage the negotiations, a final and complete agreement can be reached. This is the second time this has happened in a year of negotiations. The first time was in April, when the Korean-Chinese representatives stated that they would repatriate 12,000 prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. This number is even higher than the number on the prisoner of war list submitted on December 18th last year. At that time, the US representatives stated that "the number of 116,000 can more closely represent the magnitude of the exchange" regarding the repatriation of our captured personnel.
    However, Washington's interest in spreading blatant lies is clearly greater than achieving a final and complete agreement. It ordered its representatives in Panmunjom to go back on their word and reiterate that the detention of 100,000 prisoners of war, including 15,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, would be the price for a ceasefire. The blatant lie spread by the US that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war would rather commit suicide than return home brought the negotiations to a standstill for more than two months.
    In the past two months, this blatant lie of the US has completely gone bankrupt as a result of the heroic struggle of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island and the mainland to return home. After this trick of forcing the Korean-Chinese side to accept conditions at the negotiating table failed, US representative Harrison returned to Panmunjom on July 1st and expressed his willingness to negotiate a solution to the last remaining problem - the repatriation of prisoners of war. The results of the administrative meeting have not yet been announced, but it is obvious that the fate of the negotiations has reached a critical juncture. If the US takes unilateral action at this critical moment as it did in April, it is likely to bring the negotiations, which are on the verge of reaching an agreement, to the brink of rupture.
    The past year of negotiations has decisively proven that the Pentagon's favorite theory of using "military pressure" to force the other party to accept conditions at the negotiating table has completely gone bankrupt. The price of this lesson is more than 325,000 people killed, wounded, or captured, including more than 129,000 Americans, more than 7,000 British, and more than 1,000 Canadians, and these are just the figures for this year's negotiations. Colonel Hickman said in April this year that the number of prisoners of war available for exchange was 116,000, only about one-third of the above number.
    The unswerving efforts made by the Korean-Chinese representatives are enough to ensure that the Korean issue will finally be resolved peacefully; if Washington sees our efforts as a sign of weakness, it is sorely mistaken. The Korean-Chinese representatives have said in the past that they are determined to fight to the end to win the right for all prisoners of war to return home as stipulated in the Geneva Convention.
    On July 3rd, the Korean-Chinese representatives said at a delegation meeting that they would repatriate all American, British, Canadian, and other nationalities' prisoners of war, as well as all Korean prisoners of war currently detained who are from South Korea. Now is the time for the US representatives to stop bartering with the lives of prisoners of war, if Harrison's words are not just hypocritical words. He said on July 1st: "The people of the world will believe that any agreement that enables the exchange of prisoners of war is a humane and reasonable act that is beneficial to both sides."
    If the US representatives let all the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from North Korea return home to live peaceful lives, then there will be no more delay in achieving a ceasefire immediately. If, according to the "administrative actions" mentioned by US spokesman Nokes, or unilaterally handling prisoners of war and letting them live as exiles or slaves forever, then this trick of stealing the sky and changing the day with the lives of prisoners of war will inevitably stifle the hope of a Korean armistice again.
    Whether Washington's interest is still in propagating its blatant lies rather than a Korean armistice will be revealed at the end of the administrative meeting. But now, a conclusion can also be drawn from the past year of negotiations: the US's insistence on forcing us to accept its ceasefire terms will inevitably lead to greater failures for Washington at the negotiating table and on the battlefield.

    停战谈判已满一年朝鲜和平系于一发
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：停战谈判今天满了一年，朝鲜和平系于一发。
    行政性会议已开了一个星期了，谈判是成功还是失败，现在就取决于它的结局。行政性会议的任务是在如何核对战俘名单与交换战俘的问题上达成符合双方要求的协议。在南日将军对停战协定草案关于遣返双方所拘留的全部战俘的第五十一款的措辞表示同意之后，这就是谈判桌上剩下的唯一的一个问题了。这个问题如能解决，只要再把行政性的细节与草案的第六十三款的措辞最后完成一下，停战协定就可以签字了。
    只要美方代表遵守已取得一致协议的原则，不再坚持以不能接受的要求来破坏谈判，最后的完全的协议就可达成。这种情形在一年的谈判中已是第二次了。第一次是在四月，那时朝中代表声明他们将在停战协定签字后遣返一万二千名战俘。这个数目比去年十二月十八日提出的战俘名单上的数目还要多。当时美方代表对遣返我方被俘人员的问题，则表示“十一万六千的数字能更近似地表示出交换数量的大小”。
    但是，华盛顿对于撒弥天大谎的兴趣显然大于取得最后的完全协议。它下令它在板门店的代表自食前言，重申要以扣留十万战俘为停战的代价，其中有中国人民志愿军被俘人员一万五千人。美方撒谎说朝中被俘人员宁可自杀也不愿回国，这个弥天大谎使谈判陷于僵局达两个多月。
    在过去两个月当中，由于在巨济岛和大陆上的朝中被俘人员为争取回家而进行英勇斗争的结果，美方的这种弥天大谎完全破产了。在这种强迫朝中方面在会议桌旁接受条件的伎俩失败以后，美方代表哈利逊于七月一日回到板门店来，表示愿意谈判解决剩下的最后一个问题——遣返战俘问题。行政性会议的结果还没有宣布，不过显而易见，谈判的命运已到了千钧一发的地步。如果在这个紧要关头美方还像在四月那样采取片面行动，那就很可能把已濒于达成协议的谈判弄到破裂的边缘。
    过去一年的谈判断然证明：五角大楼喜爱的用“军事压力”强迫对方在会议桌旁接受条件的理论，已经完全破产了。这种教训的代价是三十二万五千多人被击毙、击伤或俘掳，其中有十二万九千多美国人，七千多英国人，一千多加拿大人，这还只是这一年的谈判中的数字。希克曼上校在今年四月间说可供交换的战俘数字是十一万六千人，只有上述数字三分之一左右。
    朝中代表所作的坚持不渝的努力，足以使朝鲜问题终于得到和平解决；如果华盛顿把我方的这种努力看做示弱，那它就大错特错了。朝中代表过去已经说过，他们誓为争取日内瓦公约中所规定的全部战俘回家的权利坚决斗争到底。
    七月三日朝中代表在代表团大会上发言说：他们将遣返所有的美国、英国、加拿大和其他国籍的战俘以及他们现在所拘留的、家在南朝鲜的全体朝鲜战俘。现在就是要美国代表停止以战俘的生命来讨价还价，如果哈利逊的话不是些虚伪的话。他在七月一日曾经说过：“全世界的人民将认为，凡是能使交换战俘得以实现的协议，都是对双方都有好处的一种人道的、合理的行为。”
    如果美国代表让所有的中国人民志愿军的被俘人员和家在北朝鲜的朝鲜人民军的被俘人员回家过和平生活，那末不会再耽搁马上就能停战了。要是依照美方发言人纳科斯所说的“行政性的行动”的办法或是单方面处理战俘而让他们永远过流放者或奴隶的生活，那末这种拿战俘的生命进行偷天换日的勾当的手法，必然会再度扼杀朝鲜停战的希望。
    华盛顿的兴趣是否仍是在于宣传它的弥天大谎而不是朝鲜停战，这一点在行政性会议结束时就可揭晓了。但是现在从过去一年来的谈判当中也可以得出一个结论：美国硬要迫使我方接受他的停战条款的做法，必将使华盛顿在会议桌上和在战场上遭到更大的失败。
