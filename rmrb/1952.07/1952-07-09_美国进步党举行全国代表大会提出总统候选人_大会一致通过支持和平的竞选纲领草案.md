Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, dispatch from Chicago: The U.S. Progressive Party National Convention was held from July 4th to 6th at Ashland Auditorium in Chicago. The convention was attended by 1,797 delegates from 41 states and approximately 1,500 guests. The convention passed the Progressive Party's draft platform and formally nominated prominent West Coast lawyer Vincent Hallinan and black women's movement leader Charlotta Bass as the party's presidential candidates for the U.S. presidential election in November this year.

On the first day of the convention, the renowned black scholar W.E.B. Du Bois delivered a speech. Du Bois first pointed out: "The Progressive Party's platform boils down to these points: peace, ending the Korean War, friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and restoring and rebuilding America." Du Bois criticized the current policies of the U.S. government, saying: "Never in human history has a country like those who now rule the United States planned such large-scale death and destruction." He said that the United States "today seems to have become the largest war-monger in history." Du Bois pointed out: "The United States has already committed every atrocity in Korea that man has ever committed against man. We have poured millions of tons of burning gasoline on Korean men, women, and children, and turned an unarmed country into ruins." Du Bois called on everyone to vote for the party's presidential candidate, Vincent Hallinan, and vice-presidential candidate, Charlotta Bass. He praised Hallinan, who is currently imprisoned, saying: "Hallinan is now in prison because prison has become the highest honor that America can give to its heroes today." He concluded his speech in a loud and powerful voice, stating: The vast majority of the American people demand peace. After his speech, all the delegates and guests from across the country unanimously stood up and cheered.

At the closing meeting on the 6th, the chairman of the Progressive Party's New York State organization, Vito Marcantonio, delivered a speech. He exposed the policies of the Republican and Democratic parties, which have abandoned the promises they made during the 1948 election. He denounced the American atrocities in Korea, saying: Because we have indiscriminately bombed and destroyed Korean villages and cities, we have lost friends among hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Europe. Marcantonio condemned the Democratic and Republican politicians for destroying the rights and freedoms of the American people as part of America's war preparations. He criticized the Democratic and Republican parties for creating a political atmosphere in the United States in which "150 million Americans have been placed in the hands of a small group of inquisitors today."

After heated discussion, the convention passed the revised draft platform, which included: requiring the U.S. government to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and abolishing recognition of Franco's Spain. The platform also included specific proposals on domestic issues such as banning pro-war propaganda, guaranteeing civil rights, and stopping racial discrimination.

After the convention closed, delegates returned to their homes. The delegates pledged to work resolutely to elect Vincent Hallinan as president and Charlotta Bass as vice president. The delegates also pledged to promote the slogan throughout the country: "The 1952 election supports candidates for peace!"

    美国进步党举行全国代表大会提出总统候选人
    大会一致通过支持和平的竞选纲领草案
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社芝加哥讯：美国进步党全国代表大会已于七月四日至六日在芝加哥阿什兰会堂举行。参加大会的有来自四十一州的代表一千七百九十七人和来宾约一千五百人。大会通过了进步党的竞选纲领草案，并正式提名西海岸著名律师哈利南和黑人妇女运动领袖巴斯夫人为参加今年十一月美国总统选举的该党总统候选人。
    在大会第一天会议上，著名黑人学者杜波依斯发表演说。杜波依斯首先指出：“进步党的政纲归结起来有这样几点：和平，终止朝鲜战争，与苏联和中华人民共和国友好相处，恢复并重建美国。”杜波依斯抨击美国政府的现行政策说：“人类历史上从来没有一个国家，像现在统治美国的这些人那样在策划着如此大规模的死亡和毁灭。”他说，美国“今天看来已成为历史上最大的战争贩子”。杜波依斯指出：“美国在朝鲜已经犯了人对人所从来没有犯过的一切暴行。我们把数百万吨燃烧的汽油倾注在朝鲜的男人女人和儿童身上，并把一个赤手空拳的国家变为废墟。”杜波依斯号召大家投票选举该党的总统候选人哈利南和副总统候选人巴斯夫人。他赞扬现在系身监狱的哈利南说：“哈利南之所以现在狱中，是因为监狱已成为美国今天所能给予它的英雄们的最高奖饰。”他最后以宏亮有力的声调结束他的演说称：绝大多数美国人民要求和平。在他演说完毕后，大会全体代表和全国各地来宾一致起立欢呼。
    在六日的闭幕会上，进步党纽约州组织的主席马肯托尼奥发表了演说。他揭露了共和与民主两党的政策，这种政策已背弃了它们在一九四八年选举时所作的诺言。他斥责美国在朝鲜的暴行说：由于我们滥炸并毁坏朝鲜的乡村和城市，我们已经在亚洲和欧洲亿万人民间失去了朋友。马肯托尼奥谴责民主党与共和党的政客以摧毁美国人民的权利与自由作为美国备战运动的一部分。他斥责民主与共和两党正在美国制造一种政治气氛，在这种气氛下“一亿五千万美国人已被置于一小撮今日的异教徒裁判者手中”。
    大会经过热烈讨论后，通过了修正后的竞选纲领草案，这些修正包括：要求美国政府与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，废除对佛朗哥西班牙的承认。这个纲领还包括禁止进行鼓动战争的宣传、保障公民权利、制止种族歧视等内政问题的具体提议。
    大会闭幕后，各地代表即分头返家。代表们保证为选举哈利南为总统、巴斯夫人为副总统而坚决努力。代表们并保证在全国各地宣传这个口号：“一九五二年选举支持和平的候选人！”
