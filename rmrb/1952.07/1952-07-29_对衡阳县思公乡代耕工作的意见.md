    Opinions on Land Tilling Work in Sigong Township, Hengyang County
    Editor: The People's Government of Sigong Township, 10th District, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, does not pay enough attention to land tilling work for military families, causing undue losses to the production of military families. There are 21 military families in Sigong Township, of which 7 should enjoy land tilling assistance. Among them, 4 families need complete contracting of labor and output, and 3 families only need help with labor. However, the People's Government of Sigong Township did not grasp this situation well and simply implemented a work-point system without in-depth inspection to truly understand the production situation of the military families, leading to some problems. The People's Government of Sigong Township also did not provide enough education to the masses and military families. For example, farmer Zou Chuntao was tilling land for military family member Shao Xinsheng, and he received 50 catties of "rapeseed cake" fertilizer from the township government, but it has been almost a month and it has not been applied to the fields for the military family.
    Based on the above situation, we believe that the following issues must be paid attention to in future land tilling work: First, fix the land tillers, establish land tilling teams, and formulate land tilling covenants; Second, work points should be issued according to a certain method, and do not let the work points run out before the land tilling work is done well; Third, hold regular meetings with military families to understand their difficulties and their opinions on the land tilling, and strengthen ideological education for the military families.

### 对衡阳县思公乡代耕工作的意见

    对衡阳县思公乡代耕工作的意见
    编辑同志：湖南省衡阳县第十区思公乡人民政府不重视代耕工作，使军属的生产受到了不应有的损失。思公乡有军属二十一户，应享受代耕的是七户，其中有四户需要完全包工包产，有三户只需要帮工。但思公乡人民政府没有很好地掌握这一情况，只是简单地实行了工票制，且又不深入检查，切实了解军属进行生产的情况，以致发生了一些毛病。思公乡人民政府对群众、对军属的教育也都不够。如农民邹春桃替军属邵新生代耕，他由乡人民政府领了五十斤“菜枯”肥，快一个月了也没有给军属下到田里。
    根据以上情况，我们认为今后在代耕工作中必须注意这几个问题：一、固定代耕人，成立代耕组，订定代耕公约；二、工票按一定的办法发给，不要弄得工票用完了，代耕工作还没搞好；三、定期召开军属会议，了解军属的困难和军属对代耕的意见，加强对军属的思想教育。
