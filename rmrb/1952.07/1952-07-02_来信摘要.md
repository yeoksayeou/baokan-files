    Literary Workers Should Create More Street Poetry to Enrich Shop Window Propaganda

    In various movements, shop window propaganda has played a significant role. When arranging shop windows, we feel that in addition to photos, cartoons, and models, the inclusion of some short and pithy street poetry would make the shop window propaganda more lively and powerful. We have searched through many newspapers and periodicals, but have not found suitable street poetry. We hope that newspapers and literary publications can appropriately publish some street poetry that complements current affairs propaganda in the future, and that literary workers can put more effort into this area, so as to enrich the content of our shop window propaganda.

    Loading and Unloading Workers Should Not Dismantle and Use Freight Car Parts

    When inspecting vehicles, the Beijing Xizhimen Train Repair Shop often finds that the brake shoe keys (a type of part for brake shoes) are missing or have fallen out. One of the reasons for this situation is that some loading and unloading workers in industrial and mining enterprises dismantle the brake shoe keys to open freight car doors, but after using them, they either do not reinstall them properly or lose them. This not only wastes state resources, but also affects the safety of trains.

    We have discovered the above situation in the loading and unloading department of the Xizhimen Coal Construction Company and have repeatedly raised our concerns with them. However, the leadership of the company has not paid attention to this issue. I believe that the company's failure to protect state property is wrong and should be corrected.

    In addition, I also suggest that loading and unloading departments in various regions strengthen the education of workers and prepare tools such as hand hammers and protractors for disassembling freight car doors, so as to prevent the dismantling of brake shoe keys to open freight car doors from continuing to occur.

    来信摘要
    文艺工作者应多创作街头诗以便丰富橱窗宣传的内容
    在各种运动中，橱窗宣传起了很大的作用。在布置橱窗时，我们觉得除了照片、漫画、模型外，如果再配合一些简短精悍的街头诗，会使橱窗宣传更加生动有力。我们曾翻过很多报刊，都没有找到合适的街头诗。我们希望报纸和文艺刊物今后能够适当地登载一些配合时事宣传的街头诗，希望文艺工作者在这一方面多出点力，就可以丰富我们橱窗宣传的内容了。

    装卸工人不应拆用货车零件
    北京西直门列车检修所在检查车辆时，常常发现闸瓦仟（管闸瓦的一种零件）脱出或丢失的情况。发生这种情况的原因之一，是某些工矿企业的装卸工人，把闸瓦仟拆下来开车门，但用完以后，又没有装好，或者丢失了。这不但浪费国家资材，还会影响列车的安全。
    我们曾在西直门煤建公司装卸部门发现上述情况，并多次向他们提出意见。但该公司领导方面一直没有注意这个问题。我认为：该公司不爱护国家财产，是不对的，应该加以纠正。
    此外，我并建议各地装卸部门加强对工人的教育，并准备手锤、分度器等拆车门的工具，以免拆闸瓦仟开车门的情况继续发生。
