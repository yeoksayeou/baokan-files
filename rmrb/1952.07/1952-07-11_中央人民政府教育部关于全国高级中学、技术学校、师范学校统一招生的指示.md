    Instructions from the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on Unified Enrollment for National Senior High Schools, Technical Schools, and Normal Schools
    Due to the relatively small number of junior high school graduates nationwide this year, and the need to maintain a certain enrollment number for senior high schools, technical schools, and normal schools, in order to ensure the realization of enrollment plans for various types of secondary schools, the unified planning and deployment must be carried out by major administrative regions, with provinces (cities) as units, to conduct unified enrollment work. This is one of the important keys to realizing the country's overall cadre training plan. Therefore, all localities must complete this year's enrollment work as a major political task. The following are the unified enrollment methods for national senior high schools, technical schools, and normal schools:
    (1) Each province (city) shall establish a unified enrollment committee, composed of the heads of the provincial (municipal) People's Government's Departments (Bureaus) of Education and Culture, Personnel, Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, and Health, and shall consult with the Organization Department and Propaganda Department of the CPC Provincial (Municipal) Committee, the Provincial (Municipal) Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Student Union. Responsible persons from relevant parties shall jointly form the committee, and simultaneously absorb central or major administrative region business departments that run secondary technical schools within the province (city). The Director (Bureau Chief) of the Department (Bureau) of Education and Culture and the Director (Bureau Chief) of the Department (Bureau) of Personnel shall serve as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the committee, respectively, and be responsible for the unified planning and leadership of all enrollment work for senior high schools, technical schools, and normal schools in the province (city).
    (2) Each provincial (municipal) unified enrollment committee shall, according to the enrollment tasks of various types of senior secondary schools assigned by the central government and major administrative regions, promptly stipulate the specific enrollment numbers of each senior high school, technical school, and other vocational school (including various types of vocational schools run locally by central and major administrative region business departments), and normal school within the province (city). All schools must conduct enrollment work under the leadership of the unified enrollment committee, appropriately dividing enrollment areas, and shall not arbitrarily change enrollment numbers or enrollment dates.
    (3) In order to ensure that various types of senior secondary schools enroll enough students according to the plan, the unified enrollment committee should systematically consult with the Youth League organization and, through the junior high school teachers, conduct ideological education on further education for the junior high school graduates. Using reports, meetings, newspapers, magazines, and broadcast speeches, they should repeatedly explain to the students the importance of various national construction undertakings. Going to school in accordance with the needs of national construction is a concrete manifestation of the patriotism of the youth of New China. Among them, special attention should be paid to the general reluctance of students to apply for normal schools, and patiently conduct persuasive education for students, so that they clearly recognize that solving the problem of teachers is a crucial link in developing people's education and ensuring the completion of the national cadre training plan. Use vivid examples of model teachers in various places to publicize to students, so that they feel that being a people's teacher is not only a glorious task, but also has a bright future.
    (4) When reviewing entrance examination results, the provincial (municipal) enrollment committees should relax standards as much as possible to prioritize the admission of children of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, industrial workers, young farmers and their children, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese.
    (5) Since there are more junior high school graduates in the Central South Region this year, central government ministries' directly affiliated secondary vocational schools and the secondary vocational schools in the North China and Northeast major administrative regions must recruit some junior high school graduates from the Central South Region in order to complete their enrollment tasks. To this end, a unified enrollment work group must be organized by major administrative region, and representatives must be sent to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to go through the procedures, and to establish close contact with the Central South Education Department to understand the enrollment dates of the provinces (cities) in the Central South Region, so that they can arrive in the Central South Region in a timely manner to participate in the unified enrollment committees of the provinces (cities) and carry out enrollment work at the same time. The unified enrollment committees of the provinces and cities in the Central South Region should mobilize older, healthier, and ideologically more progressive young people to study in other regions as much as possible, and actively help the enrollment work groups complete their tasks, in order to ensure the full realization of the national cadre training plan. As for the travel expenses for junior high school graduates from the provinces and cities in the Central South Region to study in other regions, the enrollment areas or departments shall be responsible for providing and reimbursing them. Individual provinces and cities that have real difficulties may submit a budget in advance to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for appropriate subsidies.
    (6) If there are special difficulties in the process of implementing the above-mentioned unified enrollment methods and it is necessary to change the original enrollment plan, it must first be reported to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for approval.

    中央人民政府教育部关于全国高级中学、技术学校、师范学校统一招生的指示
    由于今年全国初级中学毕业生较少，而高级中学、技术学校、师范学校招生又需要保持一定数字，为保证各类中等学校招生计划的实现，必须由各大行政区统一计划布置，以省（市）为单位进行统一招生工作。这是实现国家整个培养干部计划的重要关键之一。因此，各地必须把今年招生工作当作重大的政治任务来完成。兹规定全国高级中学、技术学校、师范学校统一招生的办法如下：
    （一）各省（市）建立统一招生委员会，由省（市）人民政府文教、人事、工业、农林、卫生各厅（局）负责人，并商请中共党委组织部和宣传部、新民主主义青年团省（市）委员会、学生联合会等有关方面负责人共同组成之，同时吸收在该省（市）地区内办有中等技术学校的中央或大行政区的业务部门参加。委员会由文教厅（局）长及人事厅（局）长分任正副主任委员，负责统一计划领导各该省（市）地区高级中学、技术学校、师范学校的全部招生工作。
    （二）各省（市）统一招生委员会应根据中央及大行政区分配的各类高级中等学校招生任务，及时规定各该省（市）地区范围内各个高级中学、技术学校及其他专业学校（包括中央及大行政区各业务部门在当地办理的各类专业学校）师范学校的具体招生人数。各校须一律在统一招生委员会领导下，适当地划分招生地区，同时进行招生工作，不得擅自改变招生数目及招生日期。
    （三）为保证各类高级中等学校按照计划招到足够的学生，统一招生委员会应有计划地商同青年团组织并通过各初级中学教师，向所属初中毕业生进行升学思想教育，运用报告、会议、报刊杂志和扩播讲演等方式，反复向学生说明国家各种建设事业的重要性，按照国家建设需要来升学是新中国青年爱国的具体表现。其中并应特别重视针对着一般学生不愿投考师范学校的情绪，耐心地向学生进行说服教育，使他们明确认识：解决师资问题是发展人民教育事业，保证完成国家培养干部计划有决定意义的一环，并运用各地模范教师的生动实例，向学生进行宣传，使他们感觉到做人民教师不仅是光荣的任务，而且前途也是光明的。
    （四）各省（市）招生委员会在审查升学考试成绩时，对烈属、军属子女、产业工人、青年农民及其子女、少数民族及华侨子弟等，应放宽尺度尽先录取。
    （五）由于今年中南区初中毕业生较多，中央人民政府各部直属中等专业学校及华北、东北大行政区各中等专业学校须在中南区招收部分初中毕业生，始能完成招生任务。为此，须以大行政区为单位组织一个统一的招生工作团，并派代表来中央教育部办理手续，和中南教育部取得密切联系，了解中南区各省（市）招生日期，以便能及时到达中南区参加各省（市）统一招生委员会，同时进行招生工作，中南区各省市统一招生委员会应尽量动员年龄较大、身体健康、思想较进步的青年到外区升学，积极帮助各招生工作团完成任务，以保证全国培养干部计划的全部实现。至于中南区各省市初中毕业生到外区升学的路费，由各该招生地区或部门负责供给报销。个别省市如确有困难者，得事前编造预算报请中央人民政府教育部酌情予以补助。
    （六）各地在执行上述统一招生办法的过程中，若遇有特殊困难须变更原招生计划时，必须先报请中央人民政府教育部批准。
                    七月五日
