    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo"), with three million members, held its third national convention in Tokyo from the 22nd to the 24th. The convention achieved a brilliant victory in the struggle against the right-wing scab elements of the Socialist Party, thwarting their conspiracy to sell out "Sohyo" to the American and Japanese reactionaries, further consolidating the united front of Japanese labor, and reaffirming the policy of opposing Japanese remilitarization.

    One of the important items on the convention's agenda was the question of whether "Sohyo" should join the reactionary "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Right-wing scab elements, led by the former "Sohyo" chairman Takeo Muto and the chairman of the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation, Totaro Fujita, tried their best to sell out "Sohyo" and turn it into a tool of the war-mongering clique. In the name of the textile, seafarers, and private railway unions, they proposed to the convention that "Sohyo" join the so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." However, this proposal was met with strong opposition. As a result of the convention's vote, a total of one hundred and seventy-nine delegates voted against it, with only forty-two in favor.

    The convention also reiterated "Sohyo's" policy of struggling against the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which enslave the Japanese nation. The convention also decided to fight against rearmament and the threat of war. In a statement on the 23rd, "Sohyo" also clearly stated that organized labor should not support candidates in the general election who do not guarantee to fight against all attempts to rearm and turn Japan into a military base.

    The convention re-elected the leadership of "Sohyo." The chairman of the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union was elected as the chairman of "Sohyo," and Akira Imamura of the Japan Teachers' Union and Yoshitaka Morotomi of the Japan Coal Miners' Union were elected as vice-chairmen. Minoru Takano was re-elected as the Secretary-General of the Secretariat.

    The victory of the "Sohyo" convention once again demonstrates that the Japanese working class, after five major strikes, is strengthening its unity and growing stronger day by day.

    日本工会总评议会全国大会击败右翼工贼分子的阴谋
    确定团结一致反对重新军国主义化的方针
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：拥有会员三百万人的日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”），从二十二日起到二十四日止在东京举行了第三届全国大会。大会在对社会党右翼工贼分子的斗争中获得了光辉胜利，击败了他们企图将“总评”出卖给美、日反动派的阴谋，进一步巩固了日本劳工统一战线，再度确定了反对日本重新军国主义化的方针。
    大会的重要议程之一，是关于“总评”是否参加反动的“国际自由工会联合会”的问题。以原任 “总评”主席武藤武雄、私营铁道工会总联合会主席藤田藤太郎等为首的右翼工贼分子，竭力想出卖“总评”，使它充当战争贩子集团的工具。他们以纺织、海员和私营铁道这三个工会的名义，向大会建议“总评”参加所谓“国际自由工会联合会”。但是，这个建议遭到了强烈的反对。大会表决的结果，共有一百七十九名代表投反对票，赞成者仅四十二人。
    大会并重申“总评”的政策是与奴役日本民族的旧金山和约与美日“安全条约”作斗争。大会也决定与重新武装和战争的威胁作斗争。“总评”在二十三日的声明中还明确表示：有组织的劳工不应支持那些在大选中不保证与重新武装和使日本变为军事基地的一切企图作斗争的候选人。
    大会改选了“总评”的领导机构。日本电气产业工会主席被选为“总评”的主席，日本教职员工会的今村明和日本煤矿工会的诸富吉隆等人被选为副主席，高野实连任事务局局长。
    “总评”大会的胜利，再次说明经过五次大罢工的日本工人阶级正在一天天加强团结，一天天壮大起来。
