    Advanced Soviet Sports

    July 18th is Soviet Sports Day. The people of the Soviet Union are enthusiastically celebrating this festival and reviewing the great achievements they have made in sports.

    In the Soviet Union, sports are one of the main methods of providing communist education to the working people, improving their health, and preparing the younger generation for labor and defending the motherland.

    In the thirty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, thanks to the Party and government's attention to and leadership in sports, Soviet sports have developed extensively and rapidly. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'s decision on sports and exercise, issued on December 27, 1948, pointed out that the main task of Soviet sports work is to vigorously develop mass sports, improve the technical level of sports, and then, on this basis, strive for world championships in major events in the near future. In recent years, Soviet sports have been advancing in accordance with this clear policy of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and have achieved many remarkable successes.

    The salient features of Soviet sports are its wide mass character, the rapid and continuous improvement of technology, and the collectivist spirit shown by athletes.

    Tens of thousands of Soviet workers, peasants, and students are enthusiastic fans and active participants in various sports. The famous Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory has nearly six thousand workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members participating in twenty-seven sports groups; the entire factory has forty-eight soccer teams and sixty volleyball teams. Last year, many collective farm sports organizations were established in the twelve republics, attracting more than 2.5 million collective farmers to participate in sports. In the past year alone, a total of about 22,000 new sports organizations were established in Soviet cities and villages, adding more than 3 million athletes and more than 800,000 athletes of all levels. In Ukraine alone, the number of people participating in various sports events reached more than 12 million last year, which is two and a half times that of 1949.

    The continuous progress of Soviet sports technology is manifested in two aspects. On the one hand, millions of people pass the "Prepared for Labor and Defense" exam every year, and on the other hand, Soviet national sports records and world records are constantly increasing. In the past year alone, Soviet athletes have created 461 national records, 37 more than the previous year; they have also created 34 world records, an increase of 14 over the previous year. Soviet volleyball and basketball teams have won the European championships. At the 11th World Student Summer Games, Soviet athletes won championships in track and field, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, boxing, weightlifting, rowing, gymnastics, and diving. Of the 558 medals awarded at the Games, more than half—259—were won by Soviet athletes, including 158 gold medals for first place. Thirty-seven years ago, when the United States held fifty world records, Russia only had six world records. Now, the Soviet Union holds nearly 70 world records in track and field, swimming, weightlifting, skating, shooting, cycling, and motorcycle sports, far exceeding capitalist countries such as the United States, Sweden, France, Italy, Norway, and Finland, and has become the most developed and advanced country in sports in the world.

    In the European Basketball Championship held in Paris last summer, the Soviet team, which won the championship, demonstrated a collectivist basketball skill with great mobility and versatility, giving the audience in capitalist countries a novel feeling and winning their appreciation and admiration. The collectivist spirit of Soviet athletes is completely different from the capitalist teams' emphasis on appearance, personal skills, and outdated tactics.

    The Soviet state has created all the necessary conditions for the development of sports. There are now 20,000 stadiums throughout the Soviet Union, and more than 1,000 well-equipped large sports grounds, including the largest in Europe, the Leningrad Stadium, which can accommodate more than 100,000 people at the same time. In addition, there are more than 60,000 playing fields, nearly 10,000 ski stations, and hundreds of water sports stations. These modern sports facilities are not only located in large cities, but also in various workers' residential areas and collective farms.

    The Soviet Union also attaches great importance to the training of sports talents. There are now about 30,000 young men and women studying in Soviet sports schools—15 sports institutes and 37 sports specialized schools. They are all helped and guided by experienced teachers and sports experts. The number of sports experts is increasing year by year. A total of 4,200 people were trained in 1950, and this number will increase to 8,000 this year. These sports trainees are assigned to work in urban and rural areas throughout the country after graduation.

    The extensive development of Soviet sports demonstrates the unparalleled superiority and vigorous vitality of socialist society, and creates favorable conditions for preparing for labor, defending the motherland, and developing production. (Attached picture)

### 先进的苏联体育事业

    先进的苏联体育事业
    七月十八日是苏联体育节。苏联全国人民都要热烈地庆祝这个节日，并检阅他们在体育事业方面所获得的巨大成就。
    在苏联，体育是使劳动人民接受共产主义教育、增进健康，使年青一代为劳动和保卫祖国而进行准备的主要方法之一。
    在苏维埃政权成立的三十多年来，由于党和政府对于体育事业的重视和领导，苏联的体育事业已得到了广泛和迅速的发展。联共中央在一九四八年十二月二十七日所发布的关于体育和运动的决定中指出，苏联体育工作的主要任务，是要大力展开群众性团体运动，提高体育的技术水平，然后在这个基础上在最近的将来在主要项目上争取世界的冠军。近年来，苏联的体育运动就是遵循着联共中央的这个明确的方针前进，并获得了许多显著的成就的。
    苏联体育的显著特点，是它的广泛的群众性、技术的迅速和不断提高，以及运动员所表现的集体主义精神。
    成千成万的苏联工人、农民与学生，都是各项体育运动的热烈的爱好者与积极的参加者。著名的莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂中，就有近六千名工人、工程师、技师和职员分别参加了二十七个体育组；全厂共有四十八个足球队和六十个排球队。去年在十二个加盟共和国建立了许多集体农场的体育团体，吸收了二百五十多万名集体农民参加体育运动。在去年一年内，苏联的城市和乡村中总共建立了约二万二千个新的体育团体，增加了三百多万名运动员和八十多万名各级运动家。仅在乌克兰，前年参加各种运动比赛的人数就达一千二百多万人，等于一九四九年时的两倍半。
    苏联运动技术的不断进步，表现在两方面。一方面是每年都有几百万人通过了“为劳动和国防准备”的考试，另一方面则是苏联全国运动纪录和世界纪录的不断增加。在去年一年内，苏联的运动员们创造了四百六十一项全国纪录，比前年多三十七项；他们又创造了三十四项世界纪录，比前年增加十四项。苏联的排球队和篮球队已经夺得了欧洲的冠军。在第十一届世界学生夏季运动会上，苏联运动员们在田径、排球、篮球、角力、拳击、举重、赛艇、体操和跳水等项目上都荣获冠军。运动会所颁发的五百五十八个奖章中，有一半以上——二百五十九个为苏联的运动员们所获得，其中还包括一百五十八个第一名的金质奖章。三十七年以前，当美国获得了五十项世界纪录的时候，俄国只有六项世界纪录。而现在，苏联在田径、游泳、举重、溜冰、射击、自行车与摩托车等运动方面，已经保持着近七十项世界纪录，大大地超过了美国、瑞典、法国、意大利、挪威与芬兰等资本主义国家，而成为世界上体育运动最发展最先进的国家。
    去年夏天在巴黎举行的欧洲篮球锦标赛中，荣获冠军的苏联球队表演了一种有极大机动性和多样性的技巧的集体主义球艺，给资本主义国家的观众以一种新颖的感觉，并得到了他们的赞赏与钦佩。苏联运动员们的集体主义精神，与资本主义国家球队的讲求外观、表现个人技巧和陈旧的战术是截然不同的。
    苏维埃国家为发展体育事业创设了一切必要的条件。现在苏联全国共有二万所体育场，一千多座设备完善的大运动场，其中包括欧洲最大的、可以同时容纳十万多人的列宁格勒运动场。此外，还有六万多个球场，近万个滑雪站和数百个水上运动站。这些设备现代化的体育场所，不但设在大城市中，而且也设在各个工人住宅区和集体农场。
    对于培养体育人材，苏联也是十分重视的。现在约有三万名青年男女正在苏联的各个体育学校——十五所体育研究所和三十七所体育专门学校中学习。他们都由经验丰富的教师与体育专家加以帮助和指导。体育专家的人数一年比一年增加。一九五○年共造就出了四千二百人，今年这个数字将要增加至八千人。这些体育学员在毕业以后就被分派到全国各地城乡中去工作。
    苏联体育事业的广泛发展，表现了社会主义社会的无比的优越性和蓬勃的生命力，并为准备劳动、保卫祖国和发展生产创造了良好的条件。（附图片）
