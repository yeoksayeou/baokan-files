    【Our Newspaper Dispatches】According to news from the Xi'an Masses Daily: After receiving the directive from the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding the implementation of publicly funded medical and preventative care for national staff members of all levels of government, party organizations, groups, and affiliated institutions, the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee instructed the heads of eleven units, including the Northwest Health Department, Finance Department, Personnel Department, Labor Department, and the Federation of Trade Unions, to form a Northwest Region-Level Publicly Funded Medical and Preventative Implementation Management Committee. This committee is responsible for managing the work related to publicly funded medical and preventative care and supervising the promotion of this work across various departments.
    On July 14th, the Northwest Health Department convened a meeting attended by over sixty people, including the heads of Northwest Region-level organs, party organizations, groups, and directly affiliated medical and health departments. Zhang Zhaoli, Deputy Minister of the Northwest Health Department, pointed out at the meeting that implementing publicly funded medical and preventative care for national staff members is an important measure by the People's Government to care for the health of national staff members, and health workers should implement this measure with a responsible attitude towards the people. Subsequently, he made an appropriate assessment of the existing problems in the Northwest Region-level medical personnel, medical equipment, hospitals, and convalescence, and asked the attendees to overcome all difficulties and resolutely implement this measure. The meeting adopted a draft implementation plan for publicly funded medical and preventative care at the Northwest Region level. It was decided that publicly funded outpatient services would begin in Northwest Region-level organs on July 20th, and hospitalization, except for a few serious and emergency cases, would begin in October.
    【Another Dispatch】According to news from the Jinan Dazhong Daily: The Shandong Provincial People's Government plans to first trial publicly funded outpatient services for national staff members in provincial-level organs and four province-administered cities, including Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Yantai, by the end of July. On July 14th, the Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Jinan Municipal People's Government jointly convened a meeting of representatives from various departments of the provincial and municipal governments, party organizations, groups, universities, colleges, and district governments of Jinan City, as well as provincial and municipal medical institutions, to study the implementation of publicly funded medical and preventative care. In order to rapidly promote the system of publicly funded medical and preventative care and begin outpatient services according to plan, the meeting requested representatives from various departments to conduct in-depth communication to all staff members of their respective departments. At the same time, they should conduct thorough investigations and research into the number and categories of national staff members entitled to publicly funded medical and preventative care, create a register, so that when implementing publicly funded medical care, they can plan meticulously based on the actual situation and provide convenience to those seeking medical treatment. Representatives from various medical units should mobilize and educate their medical and health staff and improve various medical institutions. Various departments should cooperate closely with the health departments to strive to make all preparations on time, so that outpatient services can begin before the end of July.
