    The Huai River basin has achieved a general wheat harvest again this year. This is the second bountiful wheat season since the Huai River was harnessed. The Huai River basin is truly beginning to transform into a rich "Huai River Granary." This year, apart from a small number of areas where wheat yields were lower than last year due to insect pests, most areas from Henan and northern Anhui to northern Jiangsu experienced a good harvest. The wheat yield per mu (0.16 acres) was generally around 120 to 150 jin (60-75 kg), with some yielding around 100 jin per mu, and others yielding as much as 250 jin per mu. The highest yields reached over 500 jin per mu. The wheat harvest in Xinyang, Huaiyang, and other special districts in Henan Province was quite good. The Jiaoting Lake area, located on the border of Xincai County along the Ru River, a tributary of the upper reaches of the Huai River, suffered from floods for more than ten consecutive years before liberation. More than 20,000 people in eight townships across the area fled their homes, and 100,000 mu of land turned into barren grasslands. In the past two years, thanks to the harnessing of the Huai River and the implementation of land reform, farmers have been actively engaged in production and have achieved good harvests for two consecutive years. This year, the average yield of wheat was 120 jin per mu. The wheat harvest on both banks of the Huai River in northern Anhui was generally good as well. In the Su County special district, the 7 million mu of land along the banks of the Sui River, a tributary of the Huai River, suffered from disasters every year before the harnessing of the Huai River. This year, wheat crops have generally flourished. If calculated at 100 jin per mu, the harvest could reach 700 million jin of wheat. In Zhangji Township, Lingbi County, all 8,235 mu of land in the township had not yielded any autumn crops for seven years and no wheat for three years before the harnessing of the Huai River. After the harnessing of the Huai River, the average yield of wheat last year was 120 jin per mu, and the entire township harvested more than 980,000 jin. This year's harvest is more than double that of last year, with an average yield of 285 jin per mu, yielding more than 2.3 million jin. This single season's harvest is enough to feed the entire township for more than a year.
    The rural areas on both banks of the Huai River, which had been devastated by floods, have now taken on a new look after two years of good harvests. Many farmers have sold their surplus grain to buy livestock, farm tools, and clothing, and their houses have also been repaired. The industry and commerce in the towns and cities along the Huai River have also become active, with fabrics and daily necessities becoming the most popular and fast-selling goods in the countryside. The people of the Huai River basin attribute their good harvests to Chairman Mao. Many farmers have written letters to Chairman Mao to report their happy lives. Gan Caihua, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River in the suburbs of Bengbu City, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao after the harvest to report the good news, saying: "My family farms 42 mu of land. This year's wheat harvest is very good, with an average yield of 175 jin per mu, totaling more than 7,000 jin of wheat, which is more than double that of last year. This kind of harvest has not been seen for many years. Respected Chairman Mao! Looking at the grain piled up in the granary, I feel more and more happy and more and more energetic. This happy life is all brought to us by you." (Xinhua News Agency)

    淮河流域今年小麦普遍丰收
    淮河流域今年小麦又普遍获得丰收，这是治淮以来第二个麦季丰收；淮河流域开始真正变成为富饶的“淮河粮仓”了。今年除少部分地区的小麦因受虫害较去年歉收外，从河南、皖北到苏北的大部地区都是丰收：每亩小麦产量一般在一百二十斤到一百五十斤左右，少的每亩也在一百斤左右，多的每亩二百五十斤，最多的有五百斤以上。河南信阳、淮阳等专区的小麦收成都不坏。淮河上游支流汝河沿岸新蔡县边境的蛟停湖区域，在解放前，连续闹了十多年水灾，全区八个乡的二万多人，大部逃了荒，十万亩地变成了荒芜的草原。这两年来，由于治理淮河，又进行了土地改革，农民积极生产，已连续得到两年的丰收。今年平均每亩收小麦一百二十斤。皖北淮河两岸的小麦一般的收成也很好。宿县专区淮河支流濉河两岸的七百万亩地，治淮前年年遭灾，今年小麦普遍丰收，如按每亩一百斤计算，就可收获七亿斤小麦。灵璧县张集乡，全乡共有八千二百三十五亩地，治淮以前，七年没有收过秋庄稼，三年没有收过麦子。治淮以后，去年每亩平均收小麦一百二十斤，全乡共收了九十八万多斤；今年又比去年多收一倍以上，每亩平均收二百八十五斤，收了二百三十多万斤，仅这一季的收成，就足够全乡人吃一年有余。
    淮河两岸被洪水败坏了的农村，经过两年来的丰收，现在已出现了新的面貌。许多农民卖掉多余的粮食，买进牲口、农具和衣服；房屋也修补好了。淮河两岸城镇的工商业，现在也活跃了起来，布匹、日用百货等已成为农村中最畅销的热门货。淮河流域的人民把丰收归功于毛主席。许多农民写信给毛主席报告他们的幸福生活。蚌埠市郊治淮劳动模范甘彩华丰收后写信向毛主席报喜说：“我家种四十二亩地，今年麦子收成很好，每亩平均收一百七十五斤，一共收七千多斤麦子，比去年要多收一倍以上。这个丰收是多少年来未有过的。敬爱的毛主席！我看看堆满囤子的粮食，真是越看越欢喜，越想越有劲。这种幸福的日子，都是您给我们带来的。”（新华社）
