Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th: A ceremony was held in the Kremlin on the 11th to award the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace" to Pietro Nenni, an active fighter for world peace, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, and General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party. Representatives from Moscow mass organizations, prominent scientists, writers, artists, and production innovators attended the ceremony. Nenni and the Italian Socialist Party delegation currently visiting the Soviet Union, took their seats on the stage amidst warm cheers from the audience. Joining them were: Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, and Committee members Fadeyev and Ehrenburg, World Peace Council Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee Tikhonov, and Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee Popova.

Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, after reading the committee's decision to award the prize, presented Nenni with the Stalin International Peace Prize winner's certificate and gold medal amidst prolonged applause. Academician Skobeltsyn warmly congratulated Nenni and wished him continued effective activity for peace. Tikhonov, Fadeyev, and representatives of the Soviet trade unions, women, and youth delivered speeches congratulating Nenni.

Massali, representing the Italian Socialist Party delegation attending the ceremony, said that awarding Nenni this lofty honor is both a recognition of Nenni as a fighter for world peace and a recognition of the firm activities of millions of Italian people in the struggle to defend peace. The Italian people have taken on a glorious obligation, and their mission is peace.

In his acceptance speech, Nenni believed that the reasons for his receiving this honor were: (1) He had carried out constant work to promote trust and cooperation between Italy and the Soviet Union; (2) He had carried out activities in the international peace movement; (3) The Italian people played a major role in the international peace movement. After pointing out that the forces defending peace around the world are stronger and more solid, Nenni emphasized: "We will continue to attract millions of our compatriots to participate in the peace movement and strengthen the Italian people's trust in the Soviet people. As far as Italy is concerned, without peace, the hope of revival is inconceivable."
