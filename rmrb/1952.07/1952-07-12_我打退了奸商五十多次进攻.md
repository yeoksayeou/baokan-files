    I Fought Off More Than Fifty Attacks by Unscrupulous Merchants

    Comrade Editor: I would like to use my own personal experience to refute Dong Anping's erroneous view that "it is inevitable to be dragged into the water by unscrupulous merchants when doing economic work." I am a technical worker at the Chabei Electric Power Bureau in Chahar Province, and a glorious Communist Party member. Since 1949, due to the needs of my work, I have often dealt with private merchants. During this period, unscrupulous merchants used all kinds of despicable and shameless insidious means to launch more than fifty rampant attacks on me. However, I did not succumb to the frequent attacks of sugar-coated bullets. I have always maintained the noble qualities of a Communist Party member and have not accepted the slightest bribe. Let me give a few examples: In 1949, when I was the acting head of the electricity meter section, I often went out to inspect electricity meters. Many merchants tried to bribe me by repeatedly inviting me to meals and drinks to make it easier for them to steal electricity. However, these were all sternly rejected by me. I firmly adjusted the electricity meters to the correct readings, without causing any loss to the state's wealth. Last year, the Yabei Electric Material Store undertook the electrical lighting installation work for the Chahar Military Region Grain Warehouse. After completion, I inspected it and found that the store had engaged in many speculative behaviors, such as replacing good wires with inferior ones. In order to ensure the safety of the power supply, I insisted that they replace the wires. After calculation, the unscrupulous merchant realized that if they reworked and replaced the wires, it would cost 8 million yuan. Not only would they not make a profit, but they would lose money. Therefore, he used more than 1 million yuan to bribe me, attempting to just muddle through. I resolutely refused his bribe and insisted on the contract stipulations, forcing them to rework and replace the wires, thereby protecting the safety of the state construction. There are many such things. I not only refused to accept bribes, but also severely criticized the unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, the unscrupulous merchants hated me very much, saying that I "really don't know what's good for me," and "this 'pliers handle'出身 fellow is too hateful, always arguing with him, not even giving him a little face." It was in this kind of struggle that I became stronger.

    What power enabled me to repel more than fifty rampant attacks by unscrupulous merchants? It is mainly due to the leadership and education of the Party. In the process of dealing with private merchants, I took the initiative to report the bribery of unscrupulous merchants to the Party, and promptly obtained the Party's education and leadership, which gave me a clear understanding and made me understand that it is an extremely shameful act of losing one's position if one harms the interests of the people due to personal greed for enjoyment. Especially after the "Three-Anti" movement, I received a profound class education. I must more firmly stand on the class position and do a good job in economic work. At the same time, I also hope that those comrades who cannot correctly treat economic work will thoroughly eliminate personal calculations, work together, and welcome the arrival of the high tide of national economic construction.

    我打退了奸商五十多次进攻
    编辑同志：我愿意以我自己亲身的经历来批驳董安平认为“做经济工作难免不被奸商拉下水”的错误看法。我是察哈尔省察中电业局的技术工作人员，是一个光荣的共产党员。从一九四九年以来，由于工作的需要，我经常和私商打交道。在这期间，奸商用各种卑鄙无耻的阴毒手段，向我进行了五十多次的猖狂进攻。但是，我并没有在糖衣炮弹的频繁袭击下屈服，我始终保持了共产党员的高贵品质，没有接受丝毫贿赂。现在举几件事说吧：一九四九年我担任电表股的代理股长，常常出去检查电表。不少商人为了偷电方便，硬拉我吃饭喝酒，企图收买我。但是，这些都被我严词拒绝了。我坚决把电表调到了正确的位数，没有使国家财富遭受损失。去年亚北电料行承做了察哈尔军区粮食仓库的电灯安装工作。完工以后经我检查，发现该行有很多投机取巧的行为，如用次线换好线等。我为了保证送电安全，就坚持要他们换线。奸商一合算，如果返工换线就得用八百万元，不但得不到利反而赔本，于是他就用一百多万元来贿赂我，企图就此草草了事。我坚决拒绝了他的贿赂，坚持了合同的规定，让他们返工换线，因此保护了国家建筑的安全。像这样的事情多得很，我不但拒绝受贿，并且严正地向奸商们提出批评。因此，奸商们非常恨我，说我“真不知好歹”“这个‘钳子把’出身的家伙太可恶了，整天和他扣头碰脑的，连这么点面子都不讲”。就在这样的斗争中，使我锻炼得更坚强了。
    什么力量使我打退了奸商五十多次的猖狂进攻呢？主要是因为党的领导和教育。我在和私商打交道的过程中，把奸商行贿的事情主动地向党作了报告，及时取得了党的教育和领导，使我有了明确的认识，懂得了如果由于个人贪图享受而损害人民的利益，是一种极可耻的有失立场的行为。特别是经过“三反”运动，我受到了一次深刻的阶级教育，我一定要更加坚定地站稳阶级立场，做好经济工作。同时我也希望那些不能正确地对待经济工作的同志们彻底清除个人打算，共同努力，迎接国家经济建设高潮的到来。    王永东
