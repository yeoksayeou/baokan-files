Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 19th: In order to improve the living conditions of the Yao people, the People's Governments of Donglan and Tiandong counties in Guangxi Province have assisted Yao compatriots to move from high mountains and steep areas to flat areas for production. In Donglan County, 759 Yao people have moved from the Xishan District to areas near the Fenghuang-Yanhe-Tiandong Highway (Hechi to Tianzhou); in Tiandong County, 497 Yao people have moved from the Jiefang Township of the Sixth District to Gaozhai Village, Zuodeng Township of the same district.

The Xishan District of Donglan County and the Jiefang Township of Tiandong County are rocky mountain areas. The Yao people living there can only plant coarse grains in the cracks of rocks on the slopes, and there are very few paddy fields and flatlands for cultivation, so the yield is extremely low; the lives of the Yao people are also particularly difficult. In the Xishan District, 60 percent of the Yao people lack food for six months of the year; in Jiefang Township, 90 percent of the Yao people have never worn shoes since they were born, most people do not have quilts, and only have one set of clothes. In order to improve the lives of the Yao people and help them develop production, the People's Government decided to carry out immigration. The People's Government provides each relocated Yao person with 360 catties of grain, lends five people a cow, allocates land to them, and helps them build new homes. Each Yao compatriot who moved to Gaozhai Village in Tiandong County was allocated 0.3 mu of paddy field and 1 mu of wasteland. With the help of local Zhuang compatriots, they have planted seedlings and coarse grains, and have also opened up part of the wasteland and built some small-scale water conservancy projects. They all expressed confidence that they will be self-sufficient in production next year.

    广西东兰、田东两县人民政府
    协助瑶胞移至平地进行生产
    【新华社南宁十九日电】为了改善瑶族人民的生活状况，广西省东兰、田东两县人民政府协助瑶族同胞从高山峻岭的地区移到平坦的地区进行生产。东兰县已有七百五十九名瑶胞，从西山区移到凤凰沿河田公路（河池至田州）的附近地区；田东县有四百九十七名瑶胞，从第六区解放乡移到该区作登乡高寨村。
    广西东兰县西山区和田东县解放乡是石山地区，聚居在当地的瑶胞只能在高岭山坡的石缝中种植杂粮，很少有水田和平地可以耕种，因此产量极低；瑶胞的生活也特别困苦。西山区的瑶胞每年缺六个月粮食的占百分之六十；解放乡有百分之九十的瑶胞有生以来从没有穿过鞋子，大部分人没有棉被，仅有一套衣裳。人民政府为了改善瑶胞的生活，帮助他们发展生产，因此决定进行移民。人民政府对移居的瑶胞每人发给粮食三百六十斤，五人合贷耕牛一头，并分配他们土地，帮助他们建造新的家园。移到田东县高寨村的瑶族同胞每人分到三分水田和一亩荒地，他们在当地僮族同胞的帮助下，已分别种上了秧苗和杂粮，并已另开了一部分荒地，修建了一些小规模的水利。他们都表示有信心在明年做到生产自给。
