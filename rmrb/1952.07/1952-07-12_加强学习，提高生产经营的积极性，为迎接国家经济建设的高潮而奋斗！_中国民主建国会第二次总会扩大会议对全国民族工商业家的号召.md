    Strengthen Learning, Enhance Enthusiasm for Production and Operation, and Strive to Welcome the High Tide of National Economic Construction!
    —An Appeal to National Industrialists and Businessmen from the Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction

    On the basis of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction convened its Second Enlarged Plenary Session in the people's capital. During the meeting, the representatives unanimously and joyfully listened to Comrade Huang Yanpei conveying Chairman Mao's instructions regarding the future direction of the association's work, and deeply recognized the importance of the association's task of uniting the national bourgeoisie, conducting self-education, and self-transformation. The convening of this enlarged plenary session of the association also happens to be after the successful conclusion of the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which has its special significance. This is because the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has already resolved a series of major problems currently existing in the industrial and commercial circles; this has created favorable conditions for the convening of this enlarged plenary session of the association.

    During the meeting, we unanimously affirmed the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. It defended the Common Program, consolidated the people's democratic united front, and cleared the way for the economic construction of the new China and the legitimate development of private industry and commerce. In particular, the "Five-Anti" movement provided an extremely profound education for the national bourgeoisie. It washed away the filth and poison left over from the old society, and corrected the speculative, opportunistic, and self-seeking practices that had long been hated by the people. For society, this was a movement to change customs and habits; for us in the industrial and commercial circles, it was a struggle for a complete transformation. Our industrial and commercial circles can thus embark on the bright road of legitimate development, which is entirely due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government!

    It cannot be denied that many national industrialists and businessmen in the past did not have sufficient understanding of politics, and did not pay enough attention to learning. We did not study the Common Program comprehensively and consistently, and some even harbored selfish intentions, unilaterally and out of context distorting the Common Program. Significantly, such as: not respecting the leadership of the working class and only abstractly talking about labor-capital mutual benefit, not obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy and only isolatedly talking about both public and private interests, not accepting the guidance of national production plans and only blindly talking about developing production. Because we failed to study the Common Program comprehensively and consistently, the "five poisons" behaviors exposed by the industrial and commercial circles during the "Five-Anti" movement were quite widespread, which also shows that the association's work in uniting the national bourgeoisie for self-education and self-transformation in the past three years was not sufficient. In the future, we must strengthen this important work.

    Recently, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on the whole country to study the Common Program, and the association expresses its heartfelt support. The association believes that this study has particularly significant implications for the industrial and commercial circles. The association calls on the national industrial and commercial circles to universally launch the study of the Common Program, and in the process of studying, it must be combined with the "Five-Anti" principles, combined with one's own thoughts and business, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to achieve consistency between words and deeds. The industrial and commercial circles must study the Common Program comprehensively rather than partially, and must grasp the spirit and essence of the Common Program, not be satisfied with a mere understanding of the words. Only in this way can our industrial and commercial circles truly be transformed. As is well known, the national bourgeoisie has two sides, and in the future, it must build on the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, promote its active and progressive side, overcome its negative and decadent side, be vigilant against the "stricter in the future" regulations, and never commit the "five poisons" again. This is an effective study of the Common Program.

    With the great victory of the three major movements of land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and with the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the country is about to enter a period of great economic construction. Director Chen Yun recently told us at the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce: "In the past two or three years, we have successfully completed the work of restoring and transforming our national economy. In the future, we will enter a large-scale planned economic construction to industrialize our country. Industrialists and businessmen across the country have already made contributions in the previous economic recovery work; in the future great economic construction, they will still bear important responsibilities." In order to welcome the upcoming high tide of economic construction, the association calls on the national industrial and commercial circles to fully enhance their enthusiasm for production and operation, and strive to develop economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood! The future of our industrial and commercial circles is bright. As long as the industrial and commercial circles follow Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, honestly abide by the Common Program, obey the leadership of the working class, the state-owned economy, and national plans, the association firmly believes that the Chinese national bourgeoisie can complete its historical mission.

    The era we live in is so great! It is so fortunate to be an industrialist and businessman in the new China of the Mao Zedong era! Our industrial and commercial circles really have no reason not to be active. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the task of our industrial and commercial circles is very arduous. Our industrial and commercial circles must be transformed, must completely abandon the decadent old society from the ideological and all work practices, and earnestly study and practice the Common Program. Only in this way can we fulfill the mission that the national bourgeoisie should fulfill in supporting the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and in the process of industrializing the new China, so as not to betray this great Mao Zedong era!

    Industrialists and businessmen across the country, unite, on the basis of the great victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, strengthen learning, enhance enthusiasm for production and operation, and strive to welcome the high tide of national economic construction!

    加强学习，提高生产经营的积极性，为迎接国家经济建设的高潮而奋斗！
    ——中国民主建国会第二次总会扩大会议对全国民族工商业家的号召
    在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，中国民主建国会在人民的首都召开了第二次总会扩大会议。在会议中，代表们一致欢欣鼓舞地听取黄炎培同志传达了毛主席对于本会今后工作方向的指示，深切地认识到本会团结民族资产阶级、进行自我教育、自我改造任务的重大。本会此次扩大会议的召开，又恰好在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议胜利结束之后，这是有其特殊意义的。因为在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议中，已经解决了工商界当前所存在的一系列的重大问题；这给本会此次扩大会议的召开，创造了有利的条件。
    在会议中，我们一致肯定了“三反”、“五反”运动的伟大成绩。它保卫了共同纲领，巩固了人民民主统一战线，为新中国经济建设和正当私营工商业的发展扫清了道路。特别是“五反”运动，它给与民族资产阶级的教育是无比深刻的。它洗涤了旧社会遗留下的污毒，纠正了久为人民所痛恨的投机取巧损人利己的作风。对于社会，这是一个移风易俗的运动；对于我们工商界，则是一场洗心革面的斗争。我们工商界从此可以走向正当发展的光明大道，这完全是由于毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府正确的领导！
    不容讳言，许多民族工商业家过去对于政治的认识是不够的，对于学习也是不够重视的。我们并没有全面地、言行一致地学习共同纲领，甚至有的还存在着私心，片面地、断章取义地来曲解共同纲领。显著的，如：不尊重工人阶级的领导而只是抽象地讲劳资两利，不服从国营经济领导而只是孤立地讲公私兼顾，不接受国家生产计划的指导而只是盲目地谈发展生产。由于未能全面地、言行一致地学习共同纲领，所以，在“五反”运动中，工商界所暴露的“五毒”行为相当普遍，这同时也说明，本会在过去三年中，对于团结民族资产阶级进行自我教育自我改造的工作做得不够。今后我们必须加强这一重要的工作。
    最近中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会号召全国进行共同纲领的学习，本会表示衷心的拥护。本会认为这一学习，对于工商界有其特别重大的意义。本会号召全国工商界普遍展开共同纲领的学习，在学习的时候，必须结合“五反”原则，结合自己的思想和业务，运用批评与自我批评的武器，以求言行的一致。工商界必须全面地而不是片面地学习共同纲领，必须领会共同纲领的精神与实质，而不以文字的了解为满足。只有如此，我们工商界才能真正得到了改造。如所周知，民族资产阶级是有两面性的，今后必须做到在“五反”运动胜利的基础上，发扬其积极的进步的一面，克服其消极的腐朽的一面，警惕“今后从严”的规定，决不再犯“五毒”。这才是有效的学习共同纲领。
    随着土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝三大运动的伟大胜利，随着“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利结束，国家即将进入经济大建设的时期。陈云主任最近在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上告诉我们：“我们在过去的两三年中，已经胜利地完成了我国人民经济的恢复和改造的工作，今后我们将要进入大规模的有计划的经济建设，使我们的国家工业化。全国的工商业者在以往的经济恢复工作中，已经有了贡献；在今后伟大的经济建设中，仍将担负重要的责任。”为着迎接即将到来的经济建设的高潮，本会号召全国工商界充分提高生产经营的积极性，为发展有利于国计民生的经济事业而努力！我们工商界的前途是光明的。只要工商界跟着毛主席和中国共产党走，老老实实遵照共同纲领，服从工人阶级、国营经济和国家计划的领导，本会深信，中国民族资产阶级是可以完成它的历史任务的。
    我们所处的时代太伟大了！做一个毛泽东时代的新中国的工商业家太幸运了！我们工商界真是没有不积极的理由的。同时也必须指出，我们工商界的任务是很艰巨的。我们工商界必须进行改造，必须从思想上和一切工作的实践上，把旧社会的腐朽的那一套完全抛弃，认真学习与实践共同纲领，只有这样，才能在支持抗美援朝的伟大斗争中，在增产节约运动中，以及在新中国工业化过程中，善尽民族资产阶级应尽的使命，才不致辜负这一伟大的毛泽东时代！
    全国工商业者团结起来，在伟大的“五反”运动胜利的基础上，加强学习，提高生产经营的积极性，为迎接国家经济建设的高潮而奋斗！
