    The Mobile Library Group in Linhe Town, Chaoxian County, Plays a Big Role

    Comrade Editor: Our cultural station in Linhe Town, Chaoxian County, used the form of a mobile library group during the spring repair and spring plowing campaign of farmers in Linhe Town and Sansheng Township this year to conduct publicity on current affairs, politics, culture, and entertainment among the levee repair workers, and achieved great results.

    Our publicity activities were carried out during the workers' rest time so as not to affect their production. During the workers' morning break, we mainly read the newspaper to them, conducting current affairs and political education; during the two afternoon breaks, the first time was for them to read picture books, and the second time was for recreational activities.

    Facts have proved that this way of carrying out cultural work meets the needs of the farmers, and they are very welcome. For example, female worker Sun Maozhen said to us: "When I go back, I will tell others that working on the levee is great because you can listen to the newspaper being read and read picture books." Whenever we were about to leave them, the workers always said: Comrades! Come earlier tomorrow, and we will work harder to complete the task. Some female workers had difficulty understanding the picture books, so we explained them to them, and they happily said after listening: I understand now that you explained it.

    Originally, it was stipulated that comic books could only be borrowed during rest time, but later, according to the demands of the masses, they were also lent to them at night to take home and read. Each worker team borrowed forty or fifty books, and every three days this team and another team would exchange the books they had borrowed.

    This method of propaganda and education, although still a new attempt for us, has made us deeply feel during the trial stage that culture can generate tremendous power once it is combined with the masses. Our mobile library group, in addition to inspiring the workers' labor enthusiasm and improving work efficiency, has also enabled the masses to understand the current affairs, understand the policies for developing agricultural production and the benefits and methods of organizing mutual aid groups, and learn some health knowledge. This has played a certain role in promoting the agricultural production movement and the patriotic health movement. Therefore, we believe that in the vast rural areas, sufficient importance must be attached to the work of mobile library groups, so that they can truly face the countryside and go deep into the masses.

    巢县临河镇图书流动小组作用大
    编辑同志：我们巢县临河镇文化站，在今年临河镇和三胜乡农民进入春修春耕运动的时候，用图书流动小组的形式，在修圩民工中进行时事、政治、文化、娱乐的宣传，取得了很大成绩。
    我们的宣传活动是利用民工休息的时间来进行的，不影响大家的生产。在民工上午休息的时候，我们主要是读报给他们听，对他们进行时事政治教育；下午两次休息时间，第一次是让他们看连环画，第二次是文娱活动。
    事实证明，这样进行文化工作，是切合农民们要求的，他们非常欢迎。如妇女民工孙茂珍对我们说：“我回去要对别人讲，上圩作工，听了读报，还有画报看，真好。”民工们每当我们要离开他们的时候，总是说：同志！明天还要早点来，我们一定加油干，完成任务。有些妇女民工看连环画不容易看懂，我们就讲解给她们听，她们听了都高兴地说：你这样一讲，我就懂了。
    本来规定只在休息时间借阅连环画册，后来根据群众的要求，晚上也借给他们带回家去看。每个民工分队借四、五十本，每三天这个分队和另一个分队把所借的书对调一次。
    这种宣传教育方式，对我们来说虽然还是新的尝试，但是在尝试阶段中，已使我们深深感到：文化一经与群众结合，就能产生出巨大的力量。我们的图书流动小组，除鼓舞了民工的劳动热情，提高工作效率以外，还使群众懂得了目前的时事，明白了发展农业生产的政策和组织互助组的好处、办法，知道了一些卫生常识。这对于开展农业生产运动和爱国卫生运动，都起了一定的推进作用。所以我们认为：在广大农村中间，必须足够地重视图书流动小组的工作，使它真正面向农村，深入群众。
