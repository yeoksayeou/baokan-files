The promotion, mobilization, preparation, and pilot work for the mass literacy method have been launched nationwide. Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, and other places have entered the large-scale trial stage. In Tianjin and Beijing alone, more than 100,000 workers and farmers are participating in mass literacy learning.

Since early May, Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, and many provinces and cities in other regions have successively held various meetings to discuss and study the steps and methods for promoting the mass literacy method. Some have also combined the meetings with training on the teaching methods of the mass literacy method. The three regions of Northeast, Central South, and Northwest, as well as most provinces in Northeast, North China, and East China, and Tianjin, Shaanxi, Hubei, and other provinces, have formulated preliminary plans for eliminating illiteracy, generally starting with eliminating illiteracy among cadres and workers, and then gradually eliminating illiteracy among farmers. For example, the Northeast region decided to eliminate illiteracy among all workers in the region within two years, and among all farmers within three to five years. Hebei Province decided to eliminate illiteracy among all cadres above the district level in the province by the end of October this year; eliminate illiteracy among industrial workers by the end of June next year; and complete the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged farmers within three years. Shenyang City requires the complete elimination of illiteracy among workers and farmers in the city by the end of next year. The Tianjin Municipal Ten-District Literacy Movement Promotion Committee decided to basically eliminate all illiteracy within the districts this year and eliminate illiteracy for 5,000 people in neighboring districts.

In order to unify leadership, mobilize and organize forces from all aspects to promote this work, East China, Shandong, Fujian, Songjiang, Shenyang, Anshan, Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places have respectively established "Mass Literacy Method Promotion Committees," "Illiteracy Elimination Promotion Associations," "Literacy Movement Committees," and "Mass Literacy Method Promotion Offices." Shenyang, Hebei, and other places have held large-scale mobilization rallies. At the mobilization rally in Hebei Province, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres in the province to take immediate action and strive to complete this glorious combat mission. He also called for the large-scale promotion of the mass literacy movement throughout the province in conjunction with the current patriotic production increase and thrift campaign. Leading organs at all levels should adopt a "contract system" to assist local people in carrying out the mass literacy movement. Heilongjiang Province specifically held a publicity work conference on the mass literacy method, while Fushun City held a Mass Literacy Method Publicity Week in mid-June. The Xinxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shanxi Province stipulated that all cadres, reporters, and propagandists going to the countryside must undertake the task of promoting the mass literacy method. The Second District of Tianjin mobilized more than 700 activists and students from worker-peasant normal schools to go deep into streets, theaters, and public places to carry out extensive publicity to citizens in various ways.

Training teachers is one of the basic conditions for the universal promotion of the mass literacy method. Most provinces and cities are stepping up this work. According to local experience, teacher training must be closely integrated with pilot work. For example, the mass literacy method learning class of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union adopted the method of learning, teaching, and researching simultaneously, and cultivated a large number of teachers. Classroom learning for teachers laid a theoretical foundation for pilot teaching, pilot teaching experience provided new materials for group research, and research work improved teaching methods and increased teaching effectiveness. At the same time, the experience of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions training class in training 81 worker teachers proves that it is entirely possible to train worker teachers from workers with more than five years of primary school education. Moreover, workers with class consciousness and rich life experiences can better grasp the spirit of the mass literacy method and use this effective teaching method than some intellectuals. In this way, the source of teachers can be expanded, providing favorable conditions for completing the task of eliminating illiteracy ahead of schedule.

In order to consolidate and improve the literacy achievements of the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the compilation and printing of a large number of excellent and popular reading materials has become a very important and urgent issue. This issue has attracted the attention of relevant parties in various places. The Northeast People's Publishing House, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture, the Bureau of Education, and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles have successively held symposiums on the issue of compiling and printing popular reading materials, and are preparing to organize forces in a planned way to engage in the creation, compilation, and publication of popular reading materials. Tianjin is actively preparing to organize a popular reading materials editorial and review committee.

The above situation illustrates the development trend of the mass literacy movement nationwide. However, on the other hand, individual regions have not moved until today, which is not right. In some areas where the mass literacy method is already being promoted, some leading cadres in some units do not pay enough attention to this work and do not correctly understand the relationship between workers' cultural learning and production work. They emphasize that production is busy and do not allow workers to attend mass literacy classes. This situation exists in some factories in Tianjin. In some factories in Pingyuan Province, leading cadres unreasonably proposed deducting wages because workers spent an hour on intensive study, which dampened the workers' enthusiasm for learning. At the same time, some leading cadres only saw the superiority of the mass literacy method and the enthusiasm of the masses for learning, and developed blind optimism and acted rashly. For example, in some industrial systems and units in Shenyang, some cultural teachers had not yet participated in the teacher training class, and they rashly organized workers to study; some wanted to form a movement all at once without going through key experiments to gain experience; some trained teachers hastily without preparation and planning (the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have promptly corrected the above situation). In some people's schools in Shenxian County, Pingyuan Province, before students had learned phonetic symbols or pinyin, they turned to intensive character learning abruptly, which made farmers feel difficult in learning, so that they gradually lost interest in the mass literacy method and even lost confidence. In order to smoothly carry out the mass literacy movement, the above two situations must be improved in time. (Yang Nongan)

### 速成识字运动已在全国范围内展开

    速成识字运动已在全国范围内展开
    推行速成识字法的宣传、动员、准备和试验工作，已在全国范围内展开，天津、北京、沈阳等地并已进入大规模的试行阶段，仅天津、北京两市参加速成识字学习的工农群众即达十余万人。
    从五月上旬开始，东北、西北、华东、中南等区和其他地区许多省市都先后通过各种会议，对推行速成识字法的步骤、方法等作了讨论和研究。有的并结合会议，传授了速成识字法的教学方法。东北、中南、西北三个区和东北、华北、华东等区的大多数省以及天津市和陕西、湖北等省，都拟定了扫除文盲的初步计划，一般是首先消灭干部、工人中的文盲，同时逐步地消灭农民中的文盲。如东北区决定在二年内扫除该区全部工人文盲，三、五年内扫除全部农民文盲。河北省决定全省区以上干部中的文盲在今年十月底全部扫清；产业工人文盲在明年六月底扫清；青壮年农民中的扫除文盲工作也要在三年内完成。沈阳市要求在明年年底彻底扫除全市工农群众中的文盲。天津市十区识字运动推动委员会决定在本年内基本扫清区内全部文盲，并代邻区扫除文盲五千人。
    为了统一领导，动员和组织各方面的力量来推动这一工作，华东区、山东、福建、松江、沈阳、鞍山、天津、山西、河北等地都分别成立了“速成识字法推广委员会”、“扫除文盲促进会”、“识字运动委员会”、“推行速成识字法办公室”等机构。沈阳、河北等地曾举行了大规模的动员大会。在河北省的动员大会上，该省中共省委书记林铁同志号召全省党员、团员、干部立刻行动起来，为完成这一个光荣的战斗任务而努力，并号召结合当前爱国增产节约竞赛运动的宣传，在全省范围内大张旗鼓地展开速成识字运动的宣传工作，各级领导机关都要采取“包干制”的办法，协助当地群众进行速成识字运动。黑龙江省专门举行了速成识字法的宣传工作会议，抚顺市则在六月中旬举行了速成识字法宣传周。山西忻县专署规定所有下乡干部、报告员、宣传员都必须担负宣传速成识字法的任务，天津市二区动员了居民积极分子及工农师范学校学员七百余人深入各街道、各影剧院或公共场所，用各种方式向市民进行了广泛的宣传。
    训练师资是普遍推广速成识字法的基本条件之一，大多数省、市正在加紧进行这一工作。根据各地的经验，训练教员必须和试点工作密切结合起来。如中国纺织工会天津市委员会速成识字法学习班采取一面学习，一面试教，一面研究的办法，大量培养师资。教员的课堂学习给试教工作打下了理论基础，试教的经验又给小组研究提供了新材料，而研究工作又改进了教学方法，提高了教学效能。同时，天津市总工会训练班培养八十一个工人教师的经验，证明了在小学五年级以上的工人中培养工人教师是完全可能的。而且有阶级觉悟和丰富生活体验的工人，比有些知识分子更能掌握速成识字法的精神和运用这种有效的教学方法。这样，便可扩大教师的来源，给提前完成扫盲任务提供了有利的条件。
    为了巩固和提高广大工农兵学员的识字成绩，大量优良通俗读物的编印，成了一个非常重要而迫切的问题。这一问题已经引起各地有关方面的重视。东北人民出版社、北京市文联、天津市文化局、教育局、文联等先后举行了编印通俗读物问题的座谈会，准备有计划地组织力量，从事通俗读物的创作、编写和出版工作，天津市正在积极筹备组织通俗读物编审委员会。
    上述情况说明了速成识字运动在全国范围内的发展趋势。但在另一方面个别地区直到今天，还没有动起来，这是不应该的。在某些已在推行速成识字法的地区，还有一些单位的领导干部对这个工作重视不够，对工人的文化学习和生产工作的关系认识不正确，强调生产忙，不让工人上速成识字班，天津某些工厂就有这种情况。平原省有些工厂领导干部因工人进行突击学习误工一小时，就无理地提出克扣工资，打击了工人的学习情绪。同时，有些领导干部只看到速成识字法的优越性和群众学习的热情，产生了盲目乐观，草率从事的现象。如沈阳某些产业系统和单位中，有的文化教员还未参加师资训练班的学习，就草率地组织工人进行学习；有的还没有经过重点实验取得经验，就想一下子形成运动；有的没有准备和计划，就匆忙地训练教员（以上情况该市文教局和市总工会已及时加以纠正）。平原省莘县有些民校在学生还没学会注音符号或拼音时，就生硬地转向突击生字，使农民在学习中感到困难，以致逐渐对速成识字法不感兴趣，甚至丧失了信心。为了速成识字运动的顺利开展，上述两种情况必须及时加以改进。（杨农安）
