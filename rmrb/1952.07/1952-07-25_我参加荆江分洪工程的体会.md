    My Experiences Participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project

    Editor: I am a female cadre who studied hydraulic engineering. After graduating, I had no experience with outdoor work. This time, the higher authorities assigned me to participate in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. I was determined to learn from the noble qualities of comrades Zhao Guilan and Qian Zhengying. From the moment I arrived at the construction site until the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, I only felt excitement, joy, and honor, and did not perceive any difficulties.

    I feel that this great and short-term Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project could only be realized in New China. This is because: First, there is the wise leadership of Chairman Mao; second, there is the support of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's democratic government; third, there is the help of advanced experience from Soviet hydraulic experts; fourth, there is the labor power of the vast numbers of soldiers, workers, and cadres united together. These superior conditions were impossible in the old China.

    I also realized that in New China, everyone has the opportunity to perform meritorious service. A total of 300,000 soldiers, workers, university professors, students, and cadres participated in this project, among whom 10,000 heroes and model workers emerged (Cao Zhonggui, the author of this letter, is also one of them—Editor). For example, the earthwork heroes Tan Shiying, Huang Guanggen, and Dai Guofa among the soldiers; the crushed stone model Yu Lihua and the mountain opening models Xiangtan Third Detachment and Ninth Detachment among the workers; the master craftsman Yin of the repair shop among the workers; Xin Zhiying, Huo Xiurong, and Tan Yuncui among the female workers; and engineer Li Fen among the cadres. They created new records and saved the country a large amount of wealth. Judging from the deeds of these heroes and model workers, regardless of gender, age, or ability, as long as you wholeheartedly serve the people, honestly do your best, use your brains more, and think of more solutions, you will surely achieve creative accomplishments. The eyes of the masses are discerning, and they will never bury anyone who has made contributions, and will definitely give you appropriate honor according to the size of your contribution. Everyone has the opportunity to perform meritorious service and become a model worker, it just depends on whether you have the determination to strive for it.

    我参加荆江分洪工程的体会
    编辑同志：我是一个学习水利工程的女干部，出了学校以后，就没有作过室外工作。这次上级分配我去参加荆江分洪工程，我下决心好好学习赵桂兰和钱正英两同志的高贵品质。从到工地开始，直到荆江分洪工程胜利完成，我只感到兴奋、愉快和光荣，没有觉到什么是我的困难。
    我感到这个伟大的时间短促的荆江分洪工程，只有在新中国才能实现。这是因为：第一、有毛主席的英明领导；第二、有中国共产党和人民民主政权的支持；第三、有苏联水利专家的先进经验的帮助；第四、有广大的军工、民工、干部团结一起的劳动力量，这些优越条件在旧中国是不可能有的。
    我也体会到，在新中国，人人都有立功的机会。参加这一工程的军工、民工、大学教授、学生、干部等，共计三十万人，其中涌现出来的英雄、模范有一万人（写这封信的曹忠贵也是其中之一——编者）。如军工中的土工英雄谭士英、黄广根、戴国法等；民工中的碎石模范余里华，开山模范湘潭三分队和九分队；工人中修配厂的尹老师傅等；女工中辛志英、霍秀容、谭云翠等；干部中李芬工程师等。他们创造了新纪录，给国家节省了大量的财富。从这些英雄模范的事迹来看，无论男女老少，无论能力大小，只要全心全意地为人民服务，老老实实地尽力工作，多动脑筋，多想办法，就一定会有创造性的成就。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，决不会埋没任何一个有功的人，一定会按照你的贡献大小给你适当的荣誉。我们人人都有立功当模范的机会，只看你自己有没有决心去争取。
