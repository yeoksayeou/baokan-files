    Hengyang Railway Bureau Vehicle Department's Self-Criticism Regarding Wasting National Transportation Capacity

    To the Editor: The letter from Comrade Guo Zhongxia published in the People's Daily on June 18th raised criticism regarding our bureau sending irreparable vehicles to factories for repair. We believe this criticism is completely correct. We originally planned to complete the cleanup of all damaged vehicles scattered in various locations in 1951, but due to our bureaucratic work style, we have not yet completed this task. At the same time, the inspection and appraisal of the damaged vehicles that have been cleared out have not been thorough enough, and as a result, irreparable damaged vehicles were sent to the Changxindian Railway Factory for repair, wasting national transportation costs. We sincerely accept this criticism and will correct our mistakes, guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again.

    衡阳铁路管理局车辆处对浪费国家运输力量的检讨
    编辑同志：六月十八日人民日报登载的郭中霞同志的信，对于我局把不能修理的车辆送到工厂修理的问题提出批评。我们认为这个批评是完全正确的。我们原来计划在一九五一年把散弃在各地的破损车辆全部清理完毕，但由于我们存在着官僚主义作风，到现在还没有把这一工作做完。同时，对已经清出的破损车辆的检查、鉴定也不够彻底，因此遂把不能修理的破损车辆送到长辛店铁路工厂修理，浪费了国家的运费。我们诚恳地接受这一批评，并纠正我们的错误，保证不再发生类似事件。
