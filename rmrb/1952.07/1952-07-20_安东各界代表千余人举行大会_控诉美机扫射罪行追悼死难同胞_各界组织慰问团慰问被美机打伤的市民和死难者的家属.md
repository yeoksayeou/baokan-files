Xinhua News Agency, Andong, July 18th: Over one thousand four hundred representatives from all walks of life in Andong City held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th to accuse U.S. planes of strafing crimes and to mourn deceased compatriots. At the meeting, people from all walks of life, with extraordinary grief and indignation, denounced the barbaric crimes of U.S. planes in harming the Chinese people and expressed deep condolences to the deceased compatriots.

    Wang Qixu, the husband of the deceased Wang Shao, accused: "After the Communist Party came, I was allocated land, and life is much better than before! My wife, daughter, and I, a family of three, were always happy every day, but the American devils won't let us live a good life, sending planes to strafe, killing my wife, and destroying the happy life of my family. This hatred must be avenged. I can't go to the Korean front to kill the enemy now, but I can participate in production. I will use the income from increased production to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, kill more American devils, and avenge my wife and all the affected compatriots!" Teng Yuling, the elder sister of the deceased child Teng Xijing, tearfully recounted the details of her younger brother's death by U.S. planes. She said: "My younger brother was only nine years old this year and loved to study very much. As soon as I got home from school, he would ask me to teach him to read. Seeing me wearing a red scarf, he urged me to sign him up for school so he could quickly join the Young Pioneers. But the hateful American planes killed him on July 11th!" Teng Yuling said angrily, "I still have an older brother. I will definitely write to him and ask him to avenge my younger brother." Meng Zhaochun, a farmer who was wounded in his left shoulder and upper left limb by U.S. planes, accused at the meeting: "The American devils not only wounded me but also wounded my wife, Wei Guilan, in the stomach. She is currently pregnant, and treatment is difficult. How brutal the American devils are! We must take revenge!"

    The accusations of the families of the deceased and the injured aroused the boundless anger of the representatives present, who unanimously expressed their determination to avenge the deceased and injured compatriots with practical actions. Chen Beichen, the Mayor of Andong City, and Wang Haizhi, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, spoke at the meeting, calling on the people of the city to use accelerated production, strengthened the Resist America, Aid Korea work, and further launched the patriotic health campaign to counter the brutal crimes of U.S. imperialism and avenge the deceased and injured compatriots.

    【新华社安东十八日电】安东市各界人民代表一千四百多人，在十八日上午九时举行控诉美机扫射罪行和追悼死难同胞大会。会上，各界人民怀着异常悲愤的心情，控诉了美机残害中国人民的野蛮罪行，并向死难同胞致深切的哀悼。
    死难的王邵氏的丈夫王启绪控诉说：“共产党来了以后，我分了土地，生活比从前好得多了！我和我的妻子、女儿一家三口人，一天总是高高兴兴的，可是美国鬼子不让我们过好日子，派飞机来扫射，打死了我的妻子，破坏了我一家的幸福生活，这个仇一定得报。我现在不能去朝鲜前线杀敌，但我能参加生产，我要用增产的收入支援中国人民志愿军，多杀几个美国鬼子，替我的妻子和所有受害的同胞报仇！”死难的儿童滕锡京的姐姐滕玉玲一字一泪地叙述了她的弟弟被美国飞机打死的经过。她说：“我的弟弟今年才九岁，很爱念书，我一放学回家，他就叫我教他识字。他看我带着红领巾，催着叫我替他报名上学，好赶快参加少年儿童队。但是，可恨的美国飞机竟在七月十一日把他打死了！”滕玉玲愤怒地说：“我还有一个哥哥，我一定写信给他，叫他替弟弟报仇。”被美机打伤左肩和左上肢的农民孟照春在会上控诉说：“美国鬼子不光打伤了我，还把我的妻子魏桂兰的肚子打伤了。她现在正怀着孕，医治都发生困难。美国鬼子是多么残暴啊！我们一定要报仇啊！”
    死难者家属和受伤者的控诉，激起了到会代表们的无比愤怒，一致表示要用实际行动来替死难和受伤的同胞报仇。安东市市长陈北辰、辽东省人民政府民政厅厅长王海之等在会上讲话，号召全市人民要用加紧生产、加强抗美援朝工作和进一步开展爱国卫生运动，来回击美帝国主义的残暴罪行，为死难和受伤的同胞报仇。大会最后通过了致全国人民的电文，表示坚决拥护周恩来外长的声明，并和全国人民团结一致，加强抗美援朝工作，支援中国人民志愿军，彻底打败美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋！
    【新华社安东十九日电】安东市各界人民十七日组织慰问团，由市长陈北辰率领，携带大批慰问品和慰问金，前往慰问在美机扫射下受伤的居民和死难者的家属。
    各界人民代表的亲切慰问，给予受害者和他们的家属以很大的安慰和鼓舞。在美机空袭时失去爱子滕锡京的滕王氏感动得流着泪说：“我要努力支援志愿军，狠狠地打美国鬼子，为我的儿子报仇。”
