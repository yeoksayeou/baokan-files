Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Tunis: The Tunisian people, despite the repression by the French colonial authorities, are still persisting in their struggle for national independence.

On the evening of the 21st, Tunisian patriots blew up a section of the Sfax-Gabès railway. On the evening of the 23rd, workers on this railway held a strike to protest the railway administration's dismissal of union officials. Personnel at a civil aviation station in Tunisia also began a week-long strike on the 24th, protesting the authorities' delay in issuing subsidies.

Cherdly, the eldest son of the King of Tunisia, issued a statement to the press, denouncing the French government's attempt to force the Tunisian people to accept the enslaving so-called "reform plan," and accusing France of using force to compel the Tunisian people to accept the Bakush puppet government. At the same time, the King of Tunisia has telegraphed the French President, opposing this "reform plan" and declaring that he has never authorized Bakush to negotiate with France on the so-called Tunisian reform issue.

The French colonial authorities continue to adopt repressive measures against the Tunisian people. On the 17th, the French colonial military court forcibly sentenced eight Tunisian patriots to varying terms of imprisonment, one of whom was sentenced to life imprisonment on the false charge of assaulting a French colonel. On the same day, Bakush, on the order of French Governor General de Hauteclocque, dissolved several Tunisian patriotic youth organizations. On the evening of the 23rd, colonial authorities arrested thirty-five union members in Farina, east of Bizerte. On the 24th, the military court again sentenced twelve Tunisian patriots to imprisonment on the charges of "participating in prohibited demonstrations" and "carrying weapons illegally."

    突尼斯人民坚持争取独立斗争
    【新华社二十六日讯】突尼斯消息：突尼斯人民不顾法国殖民当局的镇压，仍然在坚持争取民族独立的斗争。
    二十一日晚上，突尼斯爱国者炸毁了斯发克斯—加培斯铁路的一段路轨。二十三日晚上，这条铁路的工人举行罢工，抗议铁路管理局开除工会职员。突尼斯一个民用航空站的人员也在二十四日开始举行为期一个星期的罢工，抗议当局迟迟不发津贴。
    突尼斯王的长子谢德烈向新闻界发表声明，斥责法国政府企图强迫突尼斯人民接受奴役性的所谓“改革计划”，并且指责法国用武力强迫突尼斯人民接受巴库士傀儡政府。同时，突尼斯王已经打电报给法国总统，反对这个“改革计划”，并声明他从来没有授权巴库士就所谓突尼斯改革问题和法国进行谈判。
    法国殖民当局继续采取镇压手段对付突尼斯人民。十七日，法国殖民者的军事法庭硬把八个突尼斯爱国者判处了刑期不等的徒刑，其中一个爱国者因为被诬殴打一个法国上校而被判无期徒刑。同日，巴库士奉法国总督德奥特喀洛克的命令，解散了若干突尼斯爱国青年的组织。二十三日晚，殖民当局在比塞大港以东的法里那地方逮捕了三十五个工会会员。二十四日，军事法庭又以所谓“参加被禁止的示威”和“私带武器”的罪名把十二个突尼斯爱国者判处徒刑。
