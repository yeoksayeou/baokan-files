Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 4th: The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao"'s appeal against the Hong Kong British government's conviction, framed as "publishing inflammatory text," has been ruled on by the Hong Kong British government's High Court panel. The ruling states that Fei Yimin, the person in charge of "Ta Kung Pao," is fined HK$4,000 or nine months imprisonment, and must pay the plaintiff's litigation costs of HK$1,500. Li Zongying is fined HK$3,000 or six months of hard labor imprisonment, and must pay the plaintiff's litigation costs of HK$1,000. The penalty of suspending "Ta Kung Pao" for six months has been changed to the twelve days from May 6th to 17th that have already been executed, and the suspension will not continue.

The appeal of the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" was debated in the Hong Kong British government's High Court panel from May 26th to June 4th. The court announced on June 4th that it would reserve its judgment, and only announced the judgment on June 28th. The court's judgment is twenty-eight pages long, and besides manipulating legal provisions to insist that the grounds for appeal "cannot be established," it still cannot provide any reason, just like the entire "trial" process, to explain why the text protesting the British imperialist bloody atrocities of March 1st, reprinted by the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," is called "inflammatory text." However, the court announced that: "The appeal in this case is rejected, and the original judgment is upheld." After the sentence was pronounced, the "Ta Kung Pao"'s defense lawyer immediately requested a debate on the suspension order. As a result of the debate on June 30th, the court announced that the "Ta Kung Pao"'s suspension period was changed from six months to the twelve days that had already been executed. The cessation of the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao"'s suspension order proves that the Hong Kong British authorities' past illegal order to suspend "Ta Kung Pao" and impose a fine was completely unjustified.

### 香港大公报停刊令中止执行  证明香港英国当局非法勒令该报停刊毫无道理

    香港大公报停刊令中止执行
    证明香港英国当局非法勒令该报停刊毫无道理
    【新华社广州四日电】香港大公报要求撤销香港英国政府以“刊载煽动性文字”进行构陷所判处的刑罚的上诉案，香港英国政府高等法院合议庭已宣布了它的判决。判决内容是大公报负责人费彝民被罚款港币四千元或徒刑九个月，另支付控方诉讼费一千五百元；李宗瀛被罚款三千元或苦工监六个月，另支付控方诉讼费一千元两项维持原判。关于大公报被处罚停刊六个月一项，则改为由五月六日至十七日的十二天业已执行，不再停刊。
    香港大公报的上诉案，在五月二十六日至六月四日间在香港英国政府高等法院合议庭进行辩论。该庭于六月四日宣布保留判决，至六月二十八日才宣布判决。该庭的判决书长达二十八页，内容除了搬弄法律条文硬说上诉理由“不能成立”外，仍然和整个“审讯”过程那样，不能举出任何一点理由来说明香港大公报转载的抗议三月一日英帝国主义血腥暴行的文字为什么被称做“煽动性文字”。可是该庭却宣布说：“本案上诉驳回，维持原判”。宣判后，大公报的辩护律师即提出要求对停刊令进行辩论。六月三十日辩论结果，该庭宣判大公报停刊期由六个月改为十二天业已执行。香港大公报停刊令的中止执行，证明香港英国当局过去非法勒令大公报停刊并罚款的行为，是完全没有道理的。
    又讯：文汇报、新晚报两案已决定撤销。
