    Labor Model Nie Zhongyi Exposes Bureaucracy

    Editor: The leading cadres of the Fourth Paper Mill of the Northeast Light Industry Bureau have serious bureaucracy and are not open to listening to the opinions of the workers. After the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign in May, the leading cadres increased the speed of No. 1 paper machine from 84 meters per minute to 105 meters per minute without discussing it with the workers. The workers did not agree with this, thinking that everyone's skills were not very proficient, and increasing it so much at once would affect the paper's output and quality. However, the leading cadres did not adopt the workers' opinions. As a result, waste paper increased. Later, after reducing the paper machine speed to 91 meters per minute, the product quality and quantity were guaranteed. Another example is that when workers in the pharmaceutical workshop proposed to modify the hot air vehicle on the burner, the engineer disagreed, and the leadership did not support it, instead saying to the workers, "Can you guarantee it?" This made the workers no longer offer opinions. The director of the paper machine workshop, seeing that there were too many defective products, gave opinions to the laboratory and quality inspection room, but the leading cadres did not pay attention to it and even wanted to dismiss the director of the paper machine workshop. Another manifestation of bureaucracy is that after the monthly production tasks are assigned, they think that "everything is fine," and they do not investigate the reasons for failing to complete the tasks. Therefore, since June of last year to the present, no month has fulfilled the production tasks given by the state.

    劳动模范聂忠义揭发官僚主义
    编辑同志：东北轻工业管理局第四造纸厂领导干部，有严重的官僚主义，不虚心听取职工群众的意见。五月份开展增产节约竞赛运动后，领导干部不经过工人讨论，便把一号抄纸机由八十四公尺抄速提高到一百零五公尺抄速。工人都不同意这样做，认为大家的技术不很熟练，一下提高这许多，会影响纸的产量和质量。但领导干部不采纳工人的意见，结果，乱纸、废纸增加。后来，把抄速降为九十一公尺后，产品质量数量才有了保证。又如制药车间工人提出要改配烧炉上的热风车，工程师不同意，领导方面也不支持，反向工人说：“你敢保证吗？”弄得工人再也不提意见了。抄纸车间主任见废品太多，便给化验室、质量检查室提出意见，领导干部也不予重视，并想把抄纸车间主任撤职。官僚主义的另一表现，是每月生产任务布置下去后，便认为“万事大吉”，完不成任务也不追究原因。因此，自去年六月至现在，没有一个月完成了国家给予的生产任务。
