Formulating Advanced Production Plans Requires Serious Ideological Struggle
Li Yan, Director of Beijing Electricity Bureau

How to formulate an advanced plan for increasing production and practicing economy is still a new question for us. In the recent formulation of this year's plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and the plan for the second half of the year and the third quarter, we have realized that the key to formulating advanced production plans lies in waging an uncompromising struggle against the bureaucratic work style and conservative thinking that suppress and disregard the inventions and creations of the masses, and guiding this struggle to every specific problem.

Advanced production plans must be based on finding shortcuts, tapping potential, and promoting advanced experiences. However, when the Beijing Electricity Bureau began to formulate its plan, it was discovered that some leading cadres and technical personnel had serious bureaucratic work styles that did not pay attention to or even suppressed the creative suggestions of the masses. A worker proposed a method for improving the filtration of transformer oil, but Xu Jintao, the head of the technical section, replied carelessly, "I'm afraid that won't work!" For the convenience of work, a worker suggested drawing a wiring diagram on the distribution board, which is often used for experiments, to indicate the names of each switch. Xu Jintao replied, "That doesn't look good!" He didn't regard "finding shortcuts" and "tapping potential" as the most effective way to improve workers' existing technical level, but said, "To find shortcuts, we must first improve technology. The workers' current technical level is not good enough!" In a substation, a worker suggested installing an automatic recorder on the oil switch to record the number of times the switch tripped. The director, Bi Heling, actually replied, "Your suggestion is not good. It would be best to suggest that the oil switch not use oil!" Another line worker proposed a new working method, and his reply was, "Your method is good, but we don't have the energy. You can use it yourself!" With this kind of wrong, even rude, attitude towards workers' inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, how can we stir up a wave of finding shortcuts and tapping potential among the workers? And what can we rely on to formulate advanced production plans?

After studying these situations, the general branch committee of the Party determined the overall action slogan: "Find shortcuts, tap potential, and clear away the stumbling blocks to increasing production and practicing economy." At this time, we launched criticism against the backward conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles of cadres, and organized inspection teams to focus on inspecting units where leading cadres had serious bureaucratic work styles and the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were suppressed. Facts have proved that this is a good method. After the units were inspected, the enthusiasm of the masses immediately rose, and they put forward rationalization proposals one after another. We also used various publicity methods to educate and promote the overall staff through the various problems discovered by the inspection teams. All units also conducted inspections of past waste phenomena, bureaucratic work styles, and unreasonable work methods and systems, and put forward their own action slogans. Among the overall staff, finding shortcuts and tapping potential quickly formed a mass movement. In less than ten days, the staff put forward seven or eight hundred opinions and suggestions from various aspects. The old quotas were broken through. What was once considered impossible was no longer difficult when the wisdom of the masses was brought into play. For example, the use of assembly line operations in the maintenance aspect greatly improved the quota for repairing transformers and overhauling electricity meters. In the past, there was an incorrect view among the staff that safe power supply and cost reduction were opposed to each other, believing that "to be safe, use more lines," and saying that the maintenance work materials were complex, impossible to plan, and could only be "taken one step at a time." However, in this planning process, due to a series of rationalization proposals put forward by the workers, not only was it guaranteed to basically eliminate accidents and a plan and preliminary quota for maintenance costs was made, but the cost was also reduced by 50% compared to the original regulations. Now, the leadership is planning to use the method of "red flag topic rewards" to concentrate the wisdom of the masses on some important issues that urgently need to be resolved.

Of course, to completely overcome conservative thinking and bureaucracy requires a long-term struggle. When the plan for increasing production and practicing economy was finalized and the plans for the third quarter and the second half of the year were continued to be formulated, the bureaucratic work style of openly and rudely suppressing the suggestions of the masses no longer existed, but some cadres still consciously or unconsciously limited their understanding to the old ways of doing things. Some units still made a certain plan based only on the situation in the same period last year, without considering the favorable conditions this year or seriously considering various specific measures; when some units formulated plans, they either did not submit them to the masses for discussion, or although they did submit them to the masses for discussion, they forgot to raise the plan again based on various new working methods. After the leadership discovered these problems, it immediately helped everyone to criticize conservative thinking, and after re-making specific measures based on the new creations of the masses and careful calculations, the plans were all raised higher than before.

These facts have made us deeply realize that overcoming conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles is by no means an easy task. Many people understand it in principle, but when dealing with each specific problem, they may not be able to fully estimate and give play to the role of new factors, use advanced thinking as a guide, and often consciously or unconsciously pick up the old ways of doing things again. Therefore, throughout the entire movement to increase production and practice economy, we must constantly oppose conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles.

    制定先进生产计划要经过严重的思想斗争
    北京电业局局长  李岩
    怎样制定一个先进的增产节约计划，对于我们还是一个新问题。在最近制定今年的增产节约计划和下半年以及第三季度的计划中，我们体会到，制定先进生产计划的关键，在于不懈怠地同压制和漠视群众的发明创造的官僚主义作风和保守思想展开不调和的斗争，并且把这一斗争引导到每一个具体问题上去。
    先进的生产计划必须建立在找窍门挖潜力推广先进经验的基础上面。但是，在北京电业局开始订计划时，就发现了在部分领导干部和技术人员中有着不重视甚至压制群众创造性建议的严重官僚主义作风。有一个工人提出了改进滤变压器油的办法，技术股长许金涛毫不注意地回答说：“这怕不行吧！”工人为了工作方便：建议在经常做试验用的配电盘旁边画一张标明各开关名称的接线图，许金涛的回答是：“这样不好看”！他不把“找窍门”“挖潜力”当做是提高工人现有技术水平的一个最有效的方法，却说什么“要找窍门得先提高技术，工人现在的技术水平不行”！在一个变电所里，曾经发生过这样令人不能容忍的事情：工人建议在油开关上安装一个自动记录器记录开关跳开次数。主任毕鹤龄竟回答说：“你这个建议还不好，最好建议油开关不要用油”！另一个线路工人提出了新的工作方法，他的答复是：“你的方法好，我们没有劲头，你自己用吧”！用这种错误的甚至蛮横的态度对待工人的发明创造和合理化建议，怎样能够在工人中掀起找窍门挖潜力的热潮？又靠什么来制定先进的生产计划呢？
    领导方面研究了这些情况，党的总支委员会确定了全局的行动口号：“找窍门，挖潜力，扫清增产节约的绊脚石”。这时，我们一面对干部中的落后的保守思想和官僚主义作风展开批评，一面组织了检查组，重点检查那些领导干部官僚主义作风严重，群众的积极性和创造性受压抑的单位。事实证明这是一个很好的办法。经过检查的单位，群众的热情立即高涨起来，纷纷提出合理化建议。我们又通过各种宣传方式，用检查组发现的各种问题来教育和推动全局职工。各个单位也都对过去的浪费现象、官僚主义作风，以及不合理的工作方法、工作制度进行了检查，各自提出了自己行动的口号。在全局职工中，找窍门挖潜力很快地形成了群众运动。不到十天，职工们从各方面提出了七八百条意见和建议。旧的定额被突破了，过去一向被认为做不到的事情，当群众的智慧一经发挥，也就不成其为难事了。比如，在检修方面采用了流水作业法，修理变压器和检修电表很快就提高了定额。过去，在职工中有一种不正确的看法，把安全供电和降低成本对立起来，认为“要安全、多用线”，并且说维护工作材料复杂，无法计划，只能“走着看”。但是，在这次订计划中，由于工人提出了一系列的合理化建议，结果，不但保证基本上消灭事故，做出了维护费用的计划和初步定额，并且比原规定的费用降低了百分之五十。现在，领导方面正拟用 “红旗课题悬赏”的办法，把群众的智慧集中在急待解决的一些重要问题上去。
    当然，要彻底克服保守思想和官僚主义，是需要长期斗争的。在增产节约计划订好，继续制定第三季度和下半年的计划时，那种公开蛮横地压制群众建议的官僚主义作风不再存在了，但是有些干部仍然自觉或不自觉地把自己的认识局限于过去老一套的做法。有的单位仍然像过去一样，不考虑今年的有利条件，不认真考虑各种具体措施，只是参考去年同时期的情况就做出某项计划来；有的单位制定计划时，或者不交群众讨论，或者虽然也交群众讨论，但是却忘记了根据各种新的工作方法，再来提高计划。领导方面发现这些问题后，立即又帮助大家对保守思想展开批判，重新依据群众中的新创造，精打细算做出具体措施后，计划都比原来提高了。
    这些事实使我们深深认识到，克服保守思想和官僚主义作风，决不是一件轻而易举的事情。许多人在原则上懂得了，但是在处理每一个具体问题时，就不一定都能够充分估计并发挥新的因素的作用，用先进的思想作为指导，而常常自觉或不自觉地重又拾起老一套的作法。因而，在整个增产节约运动中，我们都必须不断反对保守思想和官僚主义作风。
