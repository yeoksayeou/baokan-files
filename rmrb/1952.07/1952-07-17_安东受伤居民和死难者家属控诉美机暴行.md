Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 16th: Andong citizens injured and families of the deceased in the American aircraft strafing on July 11th, angrily accuse the American murderers of their bloody crimes.

Wei Guilan, a pregnant woman who was wounded by American bullets in her lower right ribs, is still unable to have surgery to treat her wound, and cannot sit or lie down day or night, and can only stand in pain. She said angrily: "My husband, Meng Zhaochun, is an honest farmer, and he was also wounded by American planes. The American bandits owe our family of two a blood debt that must be repaid!" Wang Jianzhi, a forty-one-year-old woman, was wounded in her right foot by American planes. Her home is in Qidao Street in Andong City, which is a residential area. She said: "Even if the American devils fly higher, they will see that this area is a densely populated residential area, but they deliberately and frantically strafed it. I am the mother of two children, and for the sake of my own children and other people's children, I must use all my strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and give these inhuman beasts a hard blow." Wang Shao's, a woman living in Renzhong Street in Andong City, died of serious injuries in this strafing. Her husband, Wang Qixu, sadly recounted the tragic circumstances of her death, saying that on that day, he and his wife were cleaning up the environment. After Wang Shao's finished tidying up the house, she came out to help her husband sweep the yard and line the pigsty. Suddenly, a bursting shrapnel pierced her right collarbone, her artery was severed, she lost too much blood, and died on the spot. Wang Qixu said angrily: "Some people saw me crying and unable to eat, and came to comfort me, but I am not only sad for her death; even more because I am a fifty-eight-year-old man, I am worried that I cannot go to the Korean front line to kill a few American devils to avenge my wife!"

Teng Xixiu, an eleven-year-old elementary school student who was injured and whose nine-year-old younger brother was killed by American planes, said from his sickbed: "That day, I was on my way home from school, and my younger brother, Teng Xijing, was playing outside with his neighbors, Zhang Jincai, Xiao Ping, and several others. I put down my schoolbag and went to them. They wanted me to tell them a story, and I had just started when I heard the sound of a plane. We looked up and saw an American plane strafing here, and my younger brother was shot down by an American bullet at that moment. He died so tragically: there was a big bloody hole in the top of his head, and a big hole in his leg. My brother was very good at playing, and I miss him very much. I cried bitterly. Now I know that crying alone is useless, so I will study hard and grow up to avenge him."

Zhang Jincai, a ten-year-old child who was injured with Teng Xixiu, still often screams in his dreams the nickname of the deceased Teng Xijing, "Xiao Zhu," on his hospital bed. When he learned that this little partner had been killed by American planes, he cried very sadly. He wanted someone to write a letter to "Volunteer Army uncles" on his behalf, saying in the letter: "...I was injured by American planes, and my friend Xiao Zhu died so pitifully. I am still young, so please do me a favor and promise me that you will kill a few more American devils to avenge me and Xiao Zhu!"

Wang Decai, a twelve-year-old elementary school student with eleven injuries all over his body, said angrily: "When my wounds are better in a few days, I will write to the newspaper to let the children all over the country and the world know that I was injured by American planes on my way home from school. Why don't the American devils want me to go to school properly?"

    安东受伤居民和死难者家属控诉美机暴行
    【新华社安东十六日电】七月十一日在美国飞机扫射下受伤的安东市民和死难者的家属，愤怒控诉美国杀人凶犯的血腥罪行。
    被美国子弹打伤了右肋骨下部的魏桂兰，是一个正在孕期的妇女，她至今还无法开刀治疗伤口，以致昼夜不能坐卧，只好痛苦地站立着。她愤恨地说：“我的丈夫孟照春，是一个老实的农民，也被美国飞机打伤了。美国强盗欠下我们一家两口的血债，一定要讨还！”四十一岁的妇女王建志，被美国飞机打伤了右脚，她的家住在安东市七道街，那里是居民住宅区。她说：“就是美国鬼子飞得再高，也会看到这一带是人烟稠密的居民区，但是它们却故意对这里疯狂扫射。我是一个有了两个孩子的母亲，为着我自己的孩子和别人的孩子，我一定要拿出一切力量来支援中国人民志愿军，给这些没有人性的野兽狠狠的打击。”住在安东市仁忠街的妇女王邵氏，在这次扫射中因伤重死亡，她的丈夫王启绪沉痛地叙述她惨死的经过说：那天，他们夫妇俩正在整理环境卫生，王邵氏收拾好屋内后，出来帮助丈夫扫院子、垫猪圈，突然一颗爆裂的弹片穿进了她的右锁骨，动脉被打断了，流血过多，当场死去。王启绪愤怒地说：“有人看我流泪和吃不下饭，都来安慰我，但我不仅是为她的死而难过；更因为我自己是一个五十八岁的老汉了，我发愁不能去朝鲜前线，杀掉几个美国鬼子，替我的妻子报仇！”
    被美国飞机杀害了九岁的小弟弟、自己也被打伤的小学生滕锡秀，今年才十一岁，他躺在病榻上说：“那天，我正放学回家，我的弟弟滕锡京正和邻居的小孩张进才、小平等几个人在门外玩。我放下书包也到他们那里去了。他们要我讲故事，我刚刚讲个头，就听到飞机声。我们抬头一看，一架美国飞机正向这里扫射，我的弟弟就在这时被美国子弹打倒了。他死得多惨：脑盖上崩了一个大血洞，腿上也崩了一个大窟窿。我的弟弟很会玩，我很想他，我曾经痛哭过。现在我知道光哭是没有用的，还是努力念好书，长大了好为他报仇。”
    和滕锡秀在一起受伤的十岁儿童张进才，他在医院的病床上，还常常在梦中惊叫死去的滕锡京的小名“小柱”。当他知道这个小伙伴已被美国飞机打死时，他哭得非常伤心。他要别人代他给“志愿军叔叔”写封信，信里说：“……我被美国飞机打伤了，我的小朋友小柱死得太可怜了。我还小，所以请你们帮个忙，一定要答应我，多杀几个美国鬼子，替我和小柱报仇！”
    十二岁的小学生王德财全身有十一处负伤，他愤怒地说：“等几天我的伤口好些时，我一定要给报社写信，让全国和全世界的小朋友们都知道，我是在放学回家的路上被美国飞机打伤的。为什么美国鬼子偏偏不让我好好上学呢？”
