Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to TASS, Mrs. Gordon, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, issued a statement regarding the resolution of the World Peace Council's special meeting. She said that the special meeting of the World Peace Council, held in Berlin from July 1st to 6th, passed a very important resolution: namely, to convene the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5th of this year. Given the current international situation, this decision is very timely. The statement reviewed the increasingly deepened threat of war in the international situation, and the growing voice of the people demanding freedom and peace, and then said: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation will meet in Bucharest on July 18th. One of the agenda items is the question of the International Democratic Women's Federation participating in the tasks set by the World Peace Council. Under the current circumstances, the International Democratic Women's Federation will call on all women in all countries to unite their strength with the strength of peace fighters, so that the future World People's Peace Congress will gain exceptionally strong power. Each of the 135 million women united in the International Democratic Women's Federation should consider it their urgent task to make other women and parents deeply aware of the importance of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. They will go deep into the broadest strata in all countries of the world to collect hundreds of millions more signatures from the people for the Peace Pact. We can make the flourishing forces of peace throughout the world defeat the forces of war.
