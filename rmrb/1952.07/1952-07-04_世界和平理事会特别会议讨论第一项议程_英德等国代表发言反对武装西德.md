Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from TASS: The World Peace Council Special Meeting held a session on the evening of the 1st, chaired by Professor Friedrich of Germany.

    The Chairman of the British Peace Committee, Mr. Shaffer, spoke on the first item on the agenda, "Peaceful Resolution of the German and Japanese Questions." Shaffer said: If we can strive for a free, independent, and democratic Japan, the obstacle to peace in Asia will be cleared. If we can end the division of Germany, if we can make all foreign troops withdraw from German territory, and give the German people the opportunity to build their lives in an independent and peaceful environment, we will eliminate the shadow of war in Europe. We cannot discuss Japan alone without considering Germany, because these two issues are interconnected. We must win peace in both Asia and Europe. We must restore freedom to both Japan and Germany. Shaffer pointed out: The Japanese and German people are being subjected to the same kind of violations. The Japanese people are being forced to accept a so-called "peace treaty," which is actually a tool for military occupation and preparation for new wars. The same thing is happening in West Germany, because the purpose of the Bonn Separate Treaty is to perpetuate the military occupation of West Germany and force its people to participate in war. However, in both countries, the people refuse to serve as cannon fodder for a new world war. Shaffer said: Today, none of us can continue to remain silent or inactive. The question now is one of peace or war, survival or death. Shaffer pointed out: As early as December 1950, a group of prominent figures from France and Belgium, representing various opinions, declared that they would fight against the rearmament of Germany. In March 1951, about nine hundred representatives from seventeen European countries gathered in Berlin and issued an open letter to workers, advocating the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified and demilitarized Germany. Just half a month ago, representatives from various countries held a meeting in Copenhagen to seriously consider the German question and reached a consensus on matters of principle. The wave of protest against the Bonn Treaty is also growing in West Germany. In Europe, as in Asia, the ground is burning under the feet of the war planners. Shaffer concluded by expressing his hope that this meeting of the World Peace Council would express its views on the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany and discuss how to more forcefully demand a Four-Power conference to discuss the German question.

    The well-known West German social leader, Ms. Haulet-Mengel, spoke next. She said that American warmongers and their Bonn lackeys are implementing policies of re-militarization and the restoration of aggressive German imperialism in West Germany. She said: Adenauer and his partners want to follow the path of Ridgway in Korea. She then talked about the broad mass movement in West Germany against the Bonn government's traitorous policies, saying: All honest Germans fully understand the great significance of the Soviet proposals on the German question. It is believed that after this meeting of the World Peace Council, the international struggle against the re-militarization of West Germany and against the implementation of the Bonn Separate Military Treaty will be even more powerful.

    The French representative, Mr. Blier, spoke, exposing the diplomatic activities between the governments of imperialist countries. He pointed out that the establishment of the "Bonn Republic" and the conclusion of treaties with it by imperialist countries is a blatant violation of international law.

    The Danish representative, Mr. Fokhammer, spoke, emphasizing that the resurgence of aggressive German militarism is against the interests of Germany's neighbors.

    The last speaker at the evening session on the 1st was the German writer, Mr. Helmke, who pointed out that the purpose of the Bonn government's policy is to conclude a separate military treaty and establish a new Wehrmacht.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from TASS: The World Peace Council Special Meeting continued its sessions on the 2nd.

    The morning session was chaired by the Italian representative, Mr. Lombardi. The Austrian representative, Mr. Fula, spoke first, pointing out that the re-militarization of West Germany threatens Austria's independence, and those who are arming West Germany are now arming Austria. Fula emphasized: The Austrian people support the struggle of the German people, and their goals are the same, which is to defend world peace. The Austrian people absolutely do not want to serve the interests of foreigners.

    The Belgian parliamentarian, Mr. Brum, revealed the truth about the United States establishing the "European Group" to deprive the peoples of Western European countries of their national independence. Brum called on peace-loving people to rise up against this threat.

    Mr. Boligante, the President of the Civil Division of the Italian Supreme Court of Appeals, then gave a speech, pointing out that the United States' actions in organizing the aggressive "European Army" are contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter. He emphasized: Any parliament that tries to ratify an agreement on the establishment of the "European Army" will not be able to make the agreement effective.

    The Polish writer, Mr. Kruczkowski, pointed out: The Polish people regard the conclusion of the "General Treaty" as an act that directly threatens peace. They believe that the Soviet government's proposals are a fair way to solve the German question. The Polish people sincerely hope to live in peace with the German people, therefore, they fully support the German people's desire for unification.

    The afternoon session was chaired by the Soviet representative, Mr. Fadeyev. The first speaker, the Israeli representative, Mr. Yali, revealed the conspiracy of the warmongers to drag the countries of the Near East into a plan to invade the Soviet Union. He said: These evil conspiracies have met with fierce resistance from the peoples of the Near East and North Africa. The peoples of the Near East and North Africa are redoubling their efforts to fight for freedom, national independence, and peace. In Israel, despite the obstruction of the reactionaries, 43 percent of adults have signed the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Yali emphasized: We, representing hundreds of thousands of peace fighters in Israel, declare that we will never fight against the Soviet Union.

    The General Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Mr. Tenny, then spoke. He detailed the activities of the warmongers in carrying out deceptive propaganda, advocating rearmament and organizing aggressive "crusades," attempting to poison Western European youth and turn them into cannon fodder for a new war. Tenny said: Western European youth are increasingly strongly opposed to preparing for a new war. Tenny concluded by calling on all peace advocates around the world to make every effort to stop the conspiracy to turn youth into a tool for launching a new world war.

    Representatives from the German Democratic Republic, Romania, West Germany, Italy, Denmark, Algeria, and other countries also spoke at the morning and afternoon sessions on the 2nd. They all expressed their opposition to the re-militarization of West Germany and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified and democratic Germany.

    世界和平理事会特别会议讨论第一项议程
    英德等国代表发言反对武装西德
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议在一日晚间举行会议，由德国腓特烈教授任主席。
    英国和平委员会主席夏菲尔就第一项议程“和平解决德国和日本问题”发言。夏菲尔说：如果我们能够争取到一个自由、独立、民主的日本，亚洲和平的障碍就清除了。如果我们能够终止德国的分裂，如果我们能够使一切外国军队撤出德国领土，并给德国人民机会在独立与和平的环境里建设他们的生活，我们就消除了欧洲的战争暗影。我们不能丢开德国而单讨论日本，因为这两个问题是相互关联的。我们必须在亚洲和欧洲都赢得和平。我们必须使日本和德国都恢复自由。夏菲尔指出：日本人民和德国人民所受到的侵犯，方式是完全一样的。日本人民被强迫接受一个所谓“和约”，这其实是军事占领和准备新战争的工具。在西德正发生同样的情形，因为波恩单独条约的目的乃是为了永远延续对西德的军事占领，强迫它的人民参加战争。但是，在这两个国家里，人民都拒绝充当新世界大战的炮灰。夏菲尔说：今天我们决没有人能够继续沉默或无所举动。现在的问题是和平或是战争，生存或是死亡的问题。夏菲尔指出：早在一九五○年十二月，就有法国和比利时的一批代表各种舆论的知名之士宣告他们要为反对重新武装德国而斗争。一九五一年三月，欧洲十七个国家约九百名代表集会在柏林，发表了一个告工人书，主张和一个统一的非军事化的德国缔结和约。最近刚刚半个月以前，来自各国的代表们在哥本哈根举行了一次会议，郑重地考虑了德国问题，在原则性问题上达到了意见一致。抗议波恩条约的浪潮也在西德增长。在欧洲也正如在亚洲一样，战争策划者脚下的土地燃烧起来了。夏菲尔最后表示，希望世界和平理事会本次会议对苏联关于与一个统一的德国缔结和约的建议表示意见，并讨论如何更有力地要求举行四大国会议讨论德国问题。
    西德著名社会领袖毫列特—孟格继起发言。她说到美国战争贩子与他们的波恩走狗正在西德实施重新军国主义化和恢复侵略成性的德国帝国主义的政策，她说：阿登纳和他的伙伴想走李奇微在朝鲜的道路。她接着谈到西德反对波恩政府卖国政策的广泛的群众运动说：所有正直的德国人都十分了解苏联关于德国问题的建议的重大意义。相信在这次世界和平理事会会议以后，反对西德重新军国主义化、反对实施波恩单独军事条约的国际斗争将更加有力。
    法国代表布利埃发言揭发了帝国主义国家政府间的外交活动，他指出帝国主义国家的建立“波恩共和国”和与它缔结条约，正是彰明较著地破坏国际法。
    丹麦代表福克哈默发言着重指出嗜好侵略的德国军国主义的再起，是违反德国的邻国的利益的。
    在一日晚间会议上最后发言的是德国作家赫姆柯，他指出波恩政府政策的目的就是缔结单独军事条约和建立新的国防军。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议在二日继续开会。
    上午会议由意大利代表龙巴迪任主席。奥地利代表佛拉首先发言，他指出西德重新军国主义化威胁着奥地利的独立，而且那些武装西德的人们现在正在武装奥地利。佛拉强调说：奥地利人民声援德意志人民的斗争，而且他们的目标是共同的，这就是保卫世界和平。奥地利人民绝不愿意为外国人的利益服务。
    比利时议员布伦姆揭露了美国建立“欧洲集团”以剥夺西欧各国人民的民族独立的真象。布伦姆号召拥护和平的人们起来反对这种威胁。
    意大利最高上诉法院民事庭庭长勃立甘特接着发表演说，指出美国组织侵略性的“欧洲军”的行动是和联合国宪章的精神相违背的。他强调说：任何想批准关于成立“欧洲军”的协定的议会，都无法使协定生效。
    波兰作家克鲁茨科夫斯基指出：波兰人民都把“一般性条约”的缔结当作是一种直接威胁和平的行为。他们认为苏联政府的建议是解决德国问题的公平办法。波兰人民热烈希望和德国人民和平相处，因此，他们完全支持德国人民要求统一的愿望。
    下午会议由苏联代表法捷耶夫担任主席。首先发言的以色列代表雅利揭露了战争贩子想把近东国家拖入侵略苏联的计划中的阴谋。他说：这些罪恶阴谋遭到了近东和北非各国人民的猛烈抵抗。近东和北非的人民正在加倍努力为争取自由、民族独立与和平而斗争。在以色列，尽管有反动派的阻扰，仍有百分之四十三的成年人签名拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言。雅利强调说：我们代表以色列几十万和平战士宣告，我们决不对苏联作战。
    世界民主青年联盟总书记特尼接着发言。他详细叙述了战争贩子进行欺骗宣传，鼓吹重整军备和组织侵略性的“十字军”，企图毒化西欧青年使他们充当新战争炮灰的活动。特尼说：西欧青年正越来越有力地反对准备新战争。特尼最后号召全世界和平拥护者尽一切努力，制止变青年为进行新世界大战的工具的阴谋活动。
    在二日上、下午会议上发言的还有：德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、西德、意大利、丹麦、阿尔及利亚等的代表。他们都表示反对西德重新军国主义化，并要求和一个统一、民主的德国缔结和约。
