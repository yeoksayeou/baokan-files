    A Letter from an Overseas Chinese Student to the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:
    On the eve of the great August 1st Army Day, please accept my highest respects!
    I am an overseas Chinese student growing up on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In Indonesian territory, there are hundreds of thousands of our compatriots. You must be very concerned about our situation.
    Starting hundreds of years ago, many compatriots from our Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces, suffering from the cruel oppression and enslavement of the reactionary ruling class in China, fled to various parts of Southeast Asia, relying on their own labor and wisdom to establish their own families and societies in completely undeveloped jungles and desolate islands.
    However, before the establishment of the people's democratic government in our motherland, overseas Chinese were subjected to bullying and humiliation everywhere. We were like orphans without a mother's protection, living unfree lives. How we longed for the day when our motherland would become strong and be able to take care of and protect us!
    Sure enough, the day people longed for finally arrived. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after more than 20 years of heroic struggle by the People's Liberation Army, a powerful New China stood up like a giant. Her light shone to every corner of the world. We overseas Chinese were ecstatic, holding celebrations everywhere, celebrating the rebirth of our motherland, celebrating the arrival of freedom and happiness.
    However, just as the newborn motherland was about to embark on the construction phase, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to use Korea as a springboard to further invade our country. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the Yalu River and, together with the Korean People's Army, repelled the frenzied offensive of the American aggressors. We have seen the great victories and countless heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in overseas progressive newspapers and periodicals. Your heroic actions have inspired our study enthusiasm and strengthened our confidence in fighting the remaining reactionary forces overseas.
    Not long ago, our school—an overseas Chinese middle school in Indonesia—launched a campaign to write letters of慰问to the Chinese People's Volunteers. All the male and female students in the school immediately responded and rushed to write letters. I think the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers must have read these letters long ago, right? I hope these letters can fly over thousands of mountains and rivers and convey the love of overseas Chinese students for you.
    With the intensification of American imperialism's aggression against Southeast Asian countries, the situation of millions of overseas Chinese is getting worse day by day. The economic power of overseas Chinese in the local area has been hit by American aggressors, and industry and commerce have plummeted. The despicable and shameless remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the "White Chinese" who fled from the mainland to overseas, are even colluding with local reactionary governments to further persecute progressive overseas Chinese democrats. Therefore, an extremely acute struggle, a struggle between light and darkness, has also unfolded among the overseas Chinese. In this struggle, the understanding and awareness of many young people have been raised, and the progressive forces are growing stronger every day. Everyone has been inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the great motherland and Chairman Mao, as well as you, and everyone's belief in victory has become firmer. Our just struggle will surely win the final victory.
    Due to the yearning and love for the motherland, overseas Chinese youth are willing to be tempered to be braver and stronger in the great melting pot of the motherland. Therefore, many people have returned to China to study. I also returned to the land of the free motherland in May of this year. Now I am writing to you from the people's capital—Beijing!
    On our way back to China, some students passed through Malaya. On a small island called Johnson, not far from Singapore, they saw many innocent Malayan Chinese imprisoned in the concentration camps of British imperialists. When the students met them, they took the students' hands and asked everyone to tell the people of the motherland and you about their suffering from British imperialist persecution.
    I also want to report to you that although the imperialist aggressors are so inhumane, the kind and peaceful people of various overseas countries are with us. The vast people of Southeast Asia are also suffering from the aggression and persecution of the imperialists, but they have not been intimidated. In Malaya, Vietnam, Siam, the Philippines, and other places, millions of people are carrying out heroic and unyielding struggles against the imperialist colonialists for their own vital interests and for the lasting peace of the world.
    Recently, American imperialism launched a brutal bacteriological warfare, frantically bombed the Yalu River power plants, which have no military nature, invaded and bombed and strafed Andong City in our country, and is still clamoring to expand the war of aggression. These despicable and shameless acts show that after suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism has not given up and still wants to use the expansion of the war of aggression to save its disastrous defeat. But I am convinced that if American imperialism dares to invade our country, the battle-hardened People's Liberation Army will surely repel the enemy completely.
    Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the people of the whole country are supporting you with great production, the vast overseas Chinese are supporting you, and the righteous people of the world are supporting you. I wish you eternal victory and eternal health!
        Overseas Chinese student, Yu Kaizhen, Beijing Municipal No. 1 Middle School

### 一个华侨学生给解放军、志愿军的信

    一个华侨学生给解放军、志愿军的信
    亲爱的解放军、志愿军同志们：
    在伟大的八一建军节前夕，请接受我最崇高的敬礼！
    我是生长在印度尼西亚的苏门答腊岛上的一个华侨学生。在印尼的土地上，居住着几十万我国的侨胞。我们的情况，你们一定是很关心的。
    从几百年以前开始，我国广东、福建等省的同胞，因为受了国内反动统治阶级的残酷压迫和奴役，许多人流亡到南洋各地，在完全没有开发的丛林中和荒岛上，依靠自己的劳动和智慧，建立了自己的家庭和社会。
    可是，在祖国的人民民主政权还没有建立起来的时候，华侨到处受人欺压和侮辱。我们好像没有母亲保护的孤儿，过着不自由的生活。我们是多么渴望着有一天自己的祖国强盛起来，能够照顾、保护我们啊！
    果然，人们渴望着的日子终于来临了。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，经过解放军二十多年的英勇斗争，强大的新中国像巨人般地站立起来了。她的光芒照射到全世界每一个角落。我们华侨都兴奋若狂，到处开庆祝会，欢庆自己祖国的新生，欢庆自由幸福的来临。
    但是，正当新生的祖国要开始踏上建设阶段的时候，美帝国主义却发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，想以朝鲜作跳板，进一步侵略我国。英勇的志愿军跨过鸭绿江，和朝鲜人民军一起，打退了美国侵略者的疯狂进攻。志愿军的伟大胜利和数不清的英勇事迹，我们在海外的进步报刊上都看到了。你们的英雄行为，鼓舞了我们的学习情绪，增强了我们与海外残余反动派斗争的信心。
    不久以前，我们的学校——印尼境内的一所华侨中学——发起了一个写信慰问志愿军的运动，全校大大小小的男女同学立刻响应，争先恐后地写信。我想，这些信志愿军同志老早都已看过了吧？我希望这些信能够飞越千山万水，传达华侨学生对你们的敬爱心情。
    随着美国侵略者对东南亚各国的加紧侵略，几百万华侨的处境也一天比一天更坏了。华侨在当地的经济力量受到美国侵略者的打击，工商业一落千丈。卑鄙无耻的国民党反动派残余，从大陆上逃亡到海外来的“白华”，更勾结当地反动政府，对当地思想进步的华侨民主人士作进一步的迫害。所以在华侨中也展开了极端尖锐的斗争，光明与黑暗的斗争。在这种斗争中，许多青年的认识和觉悟提高了，进步的力量在天天增强。大家受到了伟大祖国和毛主席以及你们的革命精神的感召，大家对胜利的信念更坚定了。我们的正义斗争必定能获得最后的胜利。
    由于对祖国的向往、热爱，华侨青年愿意自己在祖国的大熔炉里锻炼得更勇敢、更坚强，因此，许多人回国学习。我也在今年五月间回到了自由祖国的土地上。如今我是在人民的首都——北京给你们写信呢！
    在我们返国途中，有一部分同学经过马来亚时，在离新加坡不远的一个叫约翰逊的小岛上，他们看见了英帝国主义者的集中营里监禁着许多无辜的马来亚华侨。当同学们和他们相遇时，他们拉着同学们的手，要求大家把他们遭受英帝国主义迫害的情形，告诉祖国的人民和你们。
    我还要向你们报告：帝国主义侵略者虽然是如此毫无人性，但海外各国善良的和平人民是和我们在一起的。南洋的广大人民同样遭受帝国主义者的侵略和迫害，但他们并没有被吓倒。在马来亚、越南、暹罗、菲律宾等地，千百万的人民，都在为着自己的切身利益和争取世界持久和平向帝国主义殖民者进行着英勇不屈的斗争。
    最近，美帝国主义发动了惨无人道的细菌战，又疯狂地轰炸毫无军事性质的鸭绿江发电厂，而且侵入我国安东市轰炸扫射，还在叫嚣要扩大侵略战争。这些卑鄙无耻的行为，说明了美帝国主义在侵朝战争中受了惨重的失败之后，心还不死，还想用扩大侵略战争来挽救它们惨败的局面。但我确信：如果美帝国主义敢于进犯我国，身经百战的人民解放军一定能把敌人彻底打退。
    亲爱的解放军、志愿军同志们，全国的人民正在以大力生产来支援你们，海外的广大华侨在支持你们，全世界的正义人士在支持你们，祝你们永远胜利，永远健康！
