New Records on the Production Front

Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau Pingdiquan Engineering Section Creates "Circular Screening of Ballast Method"

Pon Yuan-nian, foreman of the Fushengzhuang Maintenance Zone of the Pingdiquan Engineering Section of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, successfully created the "Circular Screening of Ballast Method" and set a new national record of screening fifteen holes of ballast per person per day. This method involves clearing ballast at five holes at the rail joint, starting from the first hole on the left side of the track, proceeding sequentially to the fifth hole, then from the fifth hole on the right side to the first hole. In each step, the large and small ballast are separated, and crushed ballast and soil are screened separately, working in a circular manner. This advanced method has increased the work efficiency of the zone from seven holes screened per person per day (eight hours) to fifteen holes per person per day (six hours), surpassing the advanced ballast screening record of Tian Chunlin in Northeast China, and reducing labor intensity.

Pingxiang Coal Mine Well-Sinking Team Workers Create New Well-Sinking Record

The well-sinking team workers of a new well construction project in the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine created a new record of sinking ten point eight meters of well in one day and night on June 26th. This record is equal to six times their previous general well-sinking efficiency. This new well construction project is very large in scale. Upon completion, its effective coal production will be equal to twice the total coal production of all the current Pingxiang Coal Mine shafts. This new record was generated on the basis of improving work methods. The leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine attaches great importance to this and is now helping the well-sinking team workers systematically summarize their experiences to consolidate and expand the achievements of this new record.

Liaoyang Textile Factory Sets New Record for Doffing Time

The Zhou Yuzhen team of the first spinning workshop of the Northeast Liaoyang Textile Factory set a new record for shortening doffing time. The average doffing time for the entire team was reduced to twenty-four seconds and seven tenths (ten people and ten machines, four hundred spindles per machine), with a minimum of twenty-two seconds and seven tenths. In the case of eleven doffings in seven and a half hours, the efficiency of the machinery and equipment reached ninety-five percent. Their main experience is the rational allocation of labor, that is, specifically assigning work based on each person's ability, overcoming the shortcomings of using manpower equally. At the same time, the machine operators and doffers have a clear division of labor in cleaning work, each with specific responsibilities. When sweeping the top of the machine, the track, and the spindle disk of the machine belly, a collective segmented patrol method is adopted, making the cleaning work fast and thorough.

Small Locomotives on the Tongpu Line Can Also Haul More and Run Faster

In the movement of full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometers, the crew of small locomotive ムカ5二九五 of the Datong Locomotive Depot, earnestly studied advanced experiences, implemented the joint labor system, and maintained good contact with various relevant departments to shorten the locomotive's dwell time. On June 7th, they drove the locomotive, traveled five hundred eight point three kilometers, and hauled an additional five hundred fifty tons of cargo. Their achievements powerfully shattered the conservative idea that "it is impossible to haul more and run faster on the Tongpu Line." (Han Daowen, Meng Naichang)

Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot Reaches Five Hundred Locomotive Kilometers Per Day for Five Months

The locomotives of the entire Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot exceeded the axle load by twenty-two million seven hundred and fifty thousand ton-kilometers in the five months from January to May of this year, averaging five hundred forty-three point seven kilometers per day. The important reason for their achievement is that the leading cadres changed their bureaucratic style in the "Three-Anti" movement, went deep into the masses, and jointly studied and improved their work methods. For example, in order to effectively use locomotives, leading cadres convened enlarged meetings of crew members and duty officers to study and determine the joint labor system in the locomotive depot, correctly formulate plans for traveling five hundred kilometers, shorten the time for locomotives to enter and leave the depot, and establish close contact with stations and dispatching departments, thus ensuring that locomotives travel five hundred kilometers, breaking the conservative idea that it is impossible to travel five hundred kilometers on slopes.

    生产战线上的新纪录
    张家口铁路分局平地泉工务段创造“循环分筛石碴法”
    张家口铁路分局平地泉工务段福生庄养路工区工长庞元年创造“循环分筛石碴法”成功，并创造了每人每天筛石碴十五孔的全国新纪录。这一方法是在钢轨接头处五个孔清筛石碴，从路左第一孔开始，循序到第五孔，再由路右第五孔到第一孔；在每一步骤中，又分清大小石碴并分筛碎碴和泥土，按循环方法进行工作。这一先进方法，使该工区过去每人每天（八小时）筛七孔的工作效率，提高到每人每天（六小时）可完成十五孔，超过了东北田春霖先进筛石碴的纪录，并减低了劳动强度。
    萍乡煤矿砌井组工人创造砌井新纪录
    国营萍乡煤矿某新井建设工程中的砌井组工人，在六月二十六日创造了一昼夜砌井十点八公尺的新纪录。这一纪录，等于他们过去一般砌井效率的六倍。这个新井建设工程，规模甚大。完工后，它的有效产煤量将等于现在萍乡煤矿所有矿井产煤总和的两倍。这一新纪录是在改进工作方法的基础上产生的，萍乡煤矿领导方面对此十分重视，现在正帮助砌井组工人系统地总结经验，以巩固和扩大这一新纪录的成绩。
    辽阳纺织厂创落纱时间新纪录
    东北辽阳纺织厂第一细纱车间周玉珍小组，创缩短落纱时间的新纪录。全组每次落纱时间平均降到二十四秒七厘（十人十台车，每台四百个锭），最低到二十二秒七厘。在七小时半落十一次纱的情况下，机器设备效率达到了百分之九十五。她们的主要经验是合理地分配了劳动力，即依据每个人的能力具体分配工作，克服平均使用人力的缺点。同时，看车工人、落纱工人在清洁工作上也分工明确，各有专责。在扫车顶、铁道、车肚锭盘时，采用集体分段巡回法，使清洁工作做得又快又彻底。

    同蒲线上小型机车也能多拉快跑
    在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，大同机务段小型机车ムカ5二九五号的乘务员，认真地学习先进经验，实行联合劳动制，很好地和各有关部门联系，缩短了机车的停留时间，在六月七日，他们驾驶机车，走行了五百零八点三公里，还多拉了五百五十吨货物。他们的成就，有力地打破了“在同蒲线不能多拉快跑”的保守思想。（韩道闻、孟乃昌）
    山海关机务段在五个月内都达到五百日车公里
    山海关机务段全段机车在今年一月到五月的五个月内，超轴了二千二百七十五万吨公里，每天平均行驶了五百四十三点七公里。他们获得以上成绩的重要原因，是在“三反”运动中领导干部改变了官僚主义作风，深入群众，共同研究，改进了工作办法。例如，为了有效地运用机车，领导干部召开了乘务员、值班员的扩大会议，研究与确定了机车车库内的联合劳动制度，正确地做出走行五百公里的计划，缩短了机车出入库的时间，并和车站、调度部门取得密切联系，因而保证了机车行驶五百公里，打破了认为在坡道上不能走行五百公里的保守思想。    （李宝璋）
