Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th. The people of India and Pakistan continue to denounce the US imperialists' atrocious bombing of the Yalu River power plants.

The Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council issued a statement saying: "The All-India Peace Council protests the US Air Force's bombing of the Yalu River power plants. At a time when the Panmunjom armistice negotiations are still in progress, such attacks by the US military will only expand the region of the Korean War and seriously threaten world peace."

Faridabadi, Secretary-General of the Lahore Peace Committee of Pakistan, issued a statement on the 3rd, saying: "Under the guise of the United Nations, the American interventionists have committed many unprecedented atrocities against the Korean people. Shooting unarmed Korean prisoners of war has become a common entertainment for the American army, but they think this is not enough. They have also begun bombing the Yalu River power plants in an attempt to expand the war currently confined to Korea. All peace-loving humanity resolutely condemns the recent actions of the American interventionists."

The Rawalpindi Regional Peace Committee of Pakistan also passed a resolution condemning the US Air Force's atrocious bombing of the Yalu River power plants.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th. TASS, London, 2nd.

The "Workers' Daily" reported: Carlisle held a meeting on June 29 and passed a resolution stating its full support for all efforts to withdraw British troops from Korea and to achieve an immediate armistice in Korea.

On the same evening, at a meeting held in Bradford, attendees passed a resolution by a vote of 400 to 4 to send a protest declaration to the local member of Parliament. In addition, women in Bradford organized a delegation to meet with the US consul to lodge a protest with him. Similar gatherings were also held in Huddersfield, Barnsley, Doncaster, and Hull. During a demonstration in Leeds on the evening of the 29th, slogans protesting the bombing of the Yalu River power plants appeared.

It is reported that workers from many factories in Yorkshire, such as Shadrows Co., British Steel Co., Faorless Co., Benjamin Simon Co., Gas Inspector Co., Ltd., have sent telegrams of protest to their members of Parliament. The Paisley District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Lingardwood Branch of the National Union of Mineworkers have both called for a swift realization of the Korean armistice. In Clydebank, 150 people signed a petition calling for a Korean armistice.

In Northern Ireland, 37 relatives and friends of prisoners of war detained in Korea participated in a conference convened by the National Women's Federation. Mrs. Carnavan, whose son was captured in Korea, spoke at the meeting, saying: "We are determined to fight to achieve the Korean peace we demand. Our goal is to organize all mothers and loved ones into a strong and united force."
