    Kaiwen Village, in Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, was a village that suffered severe damage in the major earthquake in the Lijiang area on December 21st of last year. But now it has been basically rebuilt.

    Walking into the streets of Kaiwen Village, you can immediately see newly built buildings and bungalows. Behind the newly built earthen walls, stand rows of wheat racks that tower above the roofs, covered with golden wheat ears. The roofs are covered with new, blue and bright tiles. The neat and flat streets, clean and solid new walls, naturally give one the feeling that this is a thriving, happy, and prosperous village. If no one had told you in advance, you would never have imagined that this tidy village had just suffered a severe earthquake disaster half a year ago.

    Kaiwen Village was one of the villages that suffered the most damage in the Lijiang earthquake. In the violent earthquake, a total of 654 houses collapsed in the village, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of houses in the village. There were casualties among people and livestock, and the food, clothing, and various daily necessities of the villagers were almost completely destroyed. Such a serious disaster, if it had happened in the past under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the suffering of the victims would have been unimaginable, and of course, it would have been impossible for them to rebuild their homes in a short period of time.

    But in Mao Zedong's new era, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government and the united mutual aid of people of all ethnic groups in non-disaster areas, through their efforts in production and self-salvation, they quickly overcame all the disasters brought to them by the earthquake. They not only purchased a large number of cattle and farm tools, completed the spring ploughing and sowing in a timely manner, and obtained a bumper wheat harvest this summer, but also repaired 359 buildings and bungalows in just over 70 days, basically completing the reconstruction of houses in the village.

    The reconstruction of Kaiwen Village started on February 27th of this year. Under the unified leadership of the county and district cadres and the village farmers' association, the masses of the village were organized into two major teams: production and construction. According to the needs of the work and the specialties of the masses, the construction team was further divided into groups for cutting wood, firing tiles, blacksmithing, and construction teams for masons, carpenters, and tilers. The wood-cutting team supplied 682 pieces of wood needed for building houses in the village in just eleven days. The blacksmithing team hammered straight all the crooked nails collected in the village in three or four days. The tile-firing team also quickly repaired the tile kiln and fired more than 39,000 new, blue and bright tiles. They quickly prepared most of the materials needed for building houses in the village, ensuring the smooth progress of all construction work.

    In the process of construction, they fully implemented the principle of adding new and repairing old, and saving by making full use of waste materials. They broke down family boundaries and concentrated all the old materials that were dismantled. Then, according to the damage of the wood, they were used rationally. Those that could be used to repair houses were used to repair houses, and the materials that were a little damaged were used to build horse pens. Even the short pieces of wood that were cut off were all used to make table legs or benches, without wasting any wood. In this way, the 359 buildings and bungalows that the village originally planned to spend at least 150 million yuan to repair were all rebuilt with only 25 million yuan of loans and 8,000 catties of grain from the People's Government, spending less than one-fifth of the original plan.

    Now, Kaiwen Village has basically returned to its pre-earthquake appearance, and is even tidier and cleaner than before. The village's primary school buildings have also been completed recently, and new desks and chairs have been made, and school will be officially opened soon.

    一个震灾区的重建
    新华社记者  唐西民
    云南省丽江县开文村，是去年十二月二十一日丽江区大地震中遭受严重损失的一个村庄。但是现在它已经基本上重建起来了。
    走进开文村的街里，你马上就可以看见一座座新修建的楼房和平屋，在新筑起来的土墙后面，矗立着一排排高出屋顶的麦架，上面挂满了金黄色的麦穗，屋顶上盖着又蓝又亮的新瓦。整齐而平坦的街道，干净而坚固的新墙，使人很自然地感到这是一个欣欣向荣的幸福富足的村庄。如果没有人预先告诉你，你绝对不会想到这个整洁的村庄，在半年之前刚遭受过严重的地震灾害。
    开文村是丽江地震中损失最大的村庄之一。在猛烈的地震中，该村一共倒塌了六百五十四间房屋，占全村原有房屋总数的百分之八十以上，人和牲畜都有伤亡，全村人民的粮食、被服和各种生活用具差不多完全被毁坏了。这样严重的一场灾难，如果发生在过去国民党反动统治时代，灾民们的痛苦是难以想像的，当然他们更不可能在很短的日子里把家园重建起来。
    但在毛泽东的新时代里，在人民政府的领导帮助、非灾区各族人民的团结互助下，他们经过生产自救的努力，很快就战胜了地震所给他们的一切灾害。他们不但添购了大批的耕牛、农具，及时完成了春耕播种，获得了今年夏季的麦子丰收，并在短短的七十多天内修复了三百五十九间楼房和平屋，基本上完成了本村的房屋重建工作。
    开文村的重建工作是从今年二月二十七日开始的，在县、区干部和本村农民协会的统一领导之下，将全村群众组成生产、修建两个大队，又按照工作的需要和群众的特长，在修建大队内分别组成砍手组、烧瓦组、打铁组和泥工、木工、瓦工等修建小组。砍手组仅十一天工夫就供应了足够本村修建房屋需要的六百八十二件木料，打铁组在三四天内便把全村收集起来的歪曲铁钉全部锤正，烧瓦组也很快就把瓦窑修好，烧出三万九千多块又蓝又亮的新瓦。他们迅速地为本村准备好了修建房屋所需要的大部材料，保证了全部修建工作的顺利进行。
    在修建过程中，他们充分贯彻了添新补旧和尽量利用废料的节约方针，打破了家庭界限，将所有拆下来的旧料都集中起来，然后按照木料的破损情形加以合理的使用。能修房屋的就用来修房屋，坏一点的材料就搭成马圈，甚至连那些裁下来的短截木料也统统被用来做成桌腿或板凳，没有使一点儿木料浪费。这样，该村原来计划至少要用一亿五千万元才能修复的三百五十九间楼房和平屋，仅仅用了人民政府的二千五百万元贷款和八千斤贷粮，花费了还不到原计划五分之一的费用，就全部重建起来了。
    现在，开文村已经基本上恢复了震灾前的面貌，而且比过去更整齐、更干净了。村里的小学校舍也在最近修建完工，并且新制了桌凳，很快就可以正式开学了。
