Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions for the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: To save space, the "Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions for the People's Daily" from various relevant parties are hereby published in摘要 form as follows.
    ▲ The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation has accepted Comrade Jiang Yang's suggestion on organizing women on the water (the original suggestion was published in this column on June 11). They have already contacted the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Police Precinct and are preparing to first understand the various situations of women on the water through the district women's federations, and then study methods for organizing women on the water.
    ▲ The warehouse management office of a certain unit of the North China Military Region has accepted Comrade Wen Yizhen's criticism (the original criticism was published in this column on June 18). They had already made a budget for dismantling and repairing the small railway tracks in April, and with the approval of higher authorities, have now begun repairing the small railway tracks. (Editor's Note: In Comrade Wen Yizhen's letter, the warehouse management office of a certain unit of the North China Military Region was mistakenly referred to as the mixed warehouse of a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district, which should be corrected.)
    ▲ The Staff Living Supply Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration has accepted Comrades Yan Yong and Dian Guang's opinions on improving the Ningyuan Dormitory cafeteria (the original opinions were published in this column on June 18). They are currently studying ways to improve the order of the cafeteria and are experimenting with selling meals on holidays.
    ▲ The Affiliated Song and Dance Theater of the Central Academy of Drama has accepted the opinions of Comrades Yan Renming and others on establishing a nursery (the original opinions were published in this column on June 25). Various difficult problems in the theater's preparation for a nursery have now been largely resolved. The original nursery of the Academy of Drama is planned to accept children of cadres of the Song and Dance Theater in August.
    ▲ The Xizhimen Transportation Station of the Beijing Transportation Company has accepted Comrade Wu Xiang's criticism (the original criticism was published in this column on July 2). After inspection, they found that the situation of loading and unloading workers拆 using brake shoe thresholds to open train doors was quite common. They have decided to strengthen political education for workers, so that workers can better cherish state property and pay attention to train safety.
