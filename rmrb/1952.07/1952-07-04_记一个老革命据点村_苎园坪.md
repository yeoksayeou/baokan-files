    Remembering an Old Revolutionary Base Village – Ziyuanping
    Zeng Yuqiu
    One morning in June, we visited an old revolutionary base village – Ziyuanping Village in Zhouning County, Fujian. The people here are victoriously building their new life.
    After passing through many dense forests and mountain roads, we reached the valley floor. A young peasant leading the way gave a long shout towards the opposite mountain, calling for the release of a timber raft to ferry us across the rushing river. At the foot of Baiyun Mountain, on the other side of the river, lies this heroic village – Ziyuanping.
    I
    Ziyuanping Village is a small village of eighteen households, sixteen of which are Miao people, and only two are Han people. Many years ago, the ancestors used their own hands to cultivate small plots of farmland from the rocky crevices of the volcanic rock mountains, more than a thousand meters above sea level. Day and night, they fought against wild boars, mountain goats, and herds of wild animals, gradually establishing themselves and living here.
    However, the reactionary rulers also extended their bloody hands into this deep mountain, seizing the people's land in this area and imposing high rents, usurious interest, and exorbitant taxes on them. Before liberation, except for one middle-peasant household that owned two mu of land, the other seventeen poor-peasant households did not have a single cent of land.
    For more than ten years, the entire village only bought salt from Zhouning, and never bought a single foot of cloth or other industrial products. They rarely ate rice throughout the year. For six months of the year, they ate sweet potato vines. From spring to summer, for five months, there was a famine, and every household had to dig up wild grass in the barren mountains and fields to eat. When the mountains were covered with snow in winter, each family huddled around the fire at night, some covering themselves with straw raincoats, or sleeping with hand warmers.
    While digging for Rulan by the river, and picking spring tea on the mountaintop, people often sang mountain songs, recounting the hardships of life:
    "Zhouning has three treasures: sweet potatoes as food, straw raincoats as cotton coats, and lice all over the body!" "Yesterday we ate bitter hemp leaves, today we eat bitter hemp stalks; halfway we want to fight you, but we don't have the strength to raise our hands!"
    II
    In 1933, after the Communists came to this village, the Han and Miao people united around the Party, organizing peasant associations and children's corps, sheltering the Red Army guerrillas so that they could effectively strike the enemy.
    Ziyuanping's terrain is very suitable for defense. In front of the village is the rapid current of the Wangxi River. This river cuts off the passage to Zhouning, and the enemy cannot cross without a timber raft. Behind it is the majestic Baiyun Mountain, where the Red Army guerrillas can enter the deep mountains and dense forests at any time. Whenever the Red Army guerrillas settled in the village, the people of Ziyuanping Village would always be on guard day and night. A mountain peak by the stream, resembling a majestic lion, is called Shizilong, and the Red Army guerrillas used to constantly strike the enemy here. Once, a platoon repelled a battalion of Kuomintang bandit troops.
    Chen Ting, the current commander of the Fujian Fu'an Military Sub-district, was fighting guerrillas here at the time. Once, he was chased by the enemy into a cave in the rocks. He took two bullets to the leg and was bleeding non-stop. But several Han and Miao people who were with him bravely shielded him, repelled the enemy, and allowed him to safely withdraw from the enemy's encirclement.
    The enemy deeply hated the masses of Ziyuanping Village. In August 1936, Kuomintang bandits arrested many people from Ziyuanping Village, detained them for seven or eight days, and interrogated them every day about the whereabouts of the Red Army. The Miao and Han people of Ziyuanping, although they clearly knew that the Red Army was in a certain place deep in Baiyun Mountain, refused to reveal a single word of truth. Old "liaison officer" Zheng Buman said: "They hit hard, but our hearts are even harder!" His younger brother, Zheng Buzhen, was arrested four times, and each time he was beaten beyond recognition, but the Kuomintang bandits could not get anything from him. In the spring of 1937, eleven more people were arrested, including Zheng Buman's elderly mother. She was beaten so badly that she could not even walk, but she resolutely refused to tell the Kuomintang bandits any information.
    Miao woman Lan Shifei recalled that early in the morning of August 25, 1936, everyone was busy harvesting rice. Landlord Chen Weijing and Chen Shouwan from Shiyang, reactionary landlords, led more than a hundred bandit soldiers down from Houshan Mountain, and Xiao Zhihe, a reactionary landlord from Longting, led another group of seventy or eighty bandit soldiers from the Chenjiashan direction on the opposite side, aggressively surrounding the entire village. They tied up the eleven people who were left at home and beat them severely, and took away many things. Then they set up firewood and burned the entire village to the ground, leaving only one house at the end of the village, where the people hiding behind the house put out the fire. After the bandit soldiers retreated, the people who returned from the mountains all gathered in this house. Men, women, old and young, looked at this ruin with unspeakable hatred and anger in their hearts. The Communists who remained active in the local area encouraged them: "It doesn't matter, we'll rebuild after it's burned down." Under the leadership of the Party, everyone went to the mountains to cut down trees and to the ridges to cut wild grass, building earth walls with their own hands. In less than a month, rows of thatched huts were rebuilt on the ruins. The reactionaries were furious. On October 18, Chen Kaijian, a reactionary landlord from Chenjiashan, led even more people to set fire. This fire was even bigger, burning half the mountain red. The entire village did not even have a single root left. The people who returned from the mountains cleaned up the fire field and took out the two cotton quilts that had been distributed from the "beating local tyrants" to cover the women and children, and everyone slept collectively in the open air. Fellow farmers from various villages also sent people from afar to bring things. Local Party comrades gathered everyone together and said: "It doesn't matter, we'll do it again." So the people of Ziyuanping set up grass sheds and built thatched houses on the ruins, treating their loved ones – the Red Army guerrillas – with the same enthusiasm.
    When the counter-revolutionary Chen Kaijian saw that the people of Ziyuanping had rebuilt their new homes across the stream, he gnashed his teeth and said, "Okay, no matter how many times you build it, I will burn it down that many times." On December 16, just as people were preparing to celebrate the New Year, this group of bandits attacked from Fu'an, Zhouning, and Shouning, setting fire to these newly built homes again, even burning the trees on Houshan Mountain.
    In the disastrous years after the Red Army left, the people of Ziyuanping kept in mind what Comrade Ye Fei had told them before he left: "Concentrate, unite, don't disperse. Revolution has failures, but it will surely succeed!" These words became the strength for the people here to persevere in their struggle. The reactionaries used bloody hands to relocate and merge villages, forbidding them to live in their original places. Some went to the deep mountains, some wandered to Jian'ou and Chong'an, and some hid under rocks. However, the people of Ziyuanping's trust in the Communist Party, and the strength generated from this trust, was like water that never dries up, and a fire that cannot be extinguished. Lan Shifei recalled: "At that time, the Kuomintang White bandits said that we were bandits and did not allow us to live in Ziyuanping. We were driven under the rocks, and the whole village slept, lived, and ate together. When it snowed, we lit a pile of fire; without a pot, we put cold rice on tiles and used hand warmers to heat it, feeding it to the children bite by bite. Life was so difficult, but for more than ten years, the entire village did not have a single traitor, and we persisted in the struggle. Until the eve of liberation, the Kuomintang bandits never dared to easily come to this mountain village without armed protection."
    The people of Ziyuanping had been waiting for the Communist Party to return, waiting for the Red Army to return. The women sang in their heavy labor:
    "I picked up a hoe and opened the road, we waited and waited; the green grass grew up and covered the road, but we still don't see the shadows of those returning!"
    III
    In 1949, Zhouning was liberated. The Communists whom the people of Ziyuanping had been waiting for day and night finally returned, and they were finally liberated. In the past two years, this desolate mountain village has become a happy new countryside. The two newly built, beautiful, and solid large houses radiate the brilliance of new life. With two floors and fifty-six rooms, the entire village can live in them. The new fir wood exudes a fragrance, and many new family doors are pasted with bright red couplets and hung with green calamus. Chen Kaijian, the evil landlord who claimed that "no matter how many times you build it, I will burn it down that many times," was justly punished by the people and sentenced to death in the early spring of 1952.
    Miao woman Lan Shifei said to us: "Last year was really a double blessing: the land returned to our home, and the houses were also built. We finally regained our dignity." Lei Dawang's family had been living in a dilapidated thatched shed for five or six years. Every time it rained, the house would turn into a pool of mud. When he moved into his new home, he asked someone in the village who could read to write a pair of bright red couplets and post them: "The mansion is completed, grateful for the wise Chairman Mao; the country is victorious, credit goes to the brave People's Liberation Army." When Zheng Buman was talking with us on the upper floor of the new house, he said meaningfully: "Chen Kaijian, who burned the house, has been taken care of! Our new house has been rebuilt."
    Since the Red Army marched north in 1936, they had not bought a foot of cloth; but last year they bought seventeen bolts all at once. The whole village made new clothes, many people having two or three pieces each, and at least one piece. Before liberation, the whole village could not find a single cotton quilt, but last year the whole village had twenty-one cotton quilts. The whole village also had thirty sheep. Zheng Buman told us with a smile: "The sheep are all bought after liberation. Counting the large and small sheep together, I have twelve of my own." Before liberation, the whole village only had more than twenty chickens, but now there are seventy-three. Before liberation, there were no pigs, rabbits, or ducks, but now there are six ducks, seven pigs, and twenty rabbits. They plan to add four more pigs, twenty more chickens, and ten more ducks this year.
    The improvement of life is the result of the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government. Before liberation, only one middle-peasant household in the whole village had two mu of land. Now, after the land reform, a total of one hundred and forty mu of paddy field have been distributed. They began to cultivate their land with vigorous enthusiasm. When we arrived at the village it was morning, and all the adult men had gone to the fields except for a few who came to the stream to warmly welcome us. Only a few Miao women were washing clothes by the clear stream, and the sound of logging came from the deep mountains and dense forests. On the half-mountain cliffs, several Miao women were picking second-flush tea quickly. On the cliff rocks behind the house, some children were drying tea leaves. Before liberation, Zheng Buman cultivated four mu of land for others, and in a good year he only harvested about seven hundred jin of grain in autumn, and he had to pay four hundred and fifty jin in rent. But last year he earned more than eight hundred and eighty jin at once. As for this year, he said: "Increasing production by 10% is not a problem." The whole village's goal for this year is to increase rice production by 10% and sweet potato production by 15%. They have organized two elementary mutual aid groups, and almost all the labor force in the village has participated. Before the end of March, they had dug more than one hundred and thirty mu of rice roots. In previous years, they only turned the soil once, but this year they turned it twice, and the turning was deep. In the past, transplanting rice seedlings was not finished until the summer solstice, but this year it was basically completed by Mangzhong. Very little fertilizer was used before liberation, but this year they have accumulated one hundred and five dan of human manure and two hundred dan of plant ash.
    Sideline production has also developed greatly. Before liberation, the whole village could only harvest three to four hundred jin of dry rough tea, and the tea mountains were all desolate. After liberation, the People's Government issued a batch of tea loans and found a sales channel for the tea, and the farmers began to actively organize the tea mountains. Last year, they harvested and produced twenty-three dan of rough tea, which brought more than eight million yuan in RMB income to the people of the village. This year, the first-flush tea alone yielded eighteen dan, and the second-flush tea is expected to yield eleven or twelve dan. The whole village has newly planted more than three thousand tea trees this year. The price ratio between tea and grain: before liberation, it was about one to three, but now it is generally one to six. The Miao women sing:
    "There are tea trees on the opposite mountain, the leaves are green in spring; the price of tea is good this year, Chairman Mao's kindness is as deep as the sea!"

    记一个老革命据点村——苎园坪
    曾毓秋
    六月里的一个早晨，我们访问了一个老革命据点村——福建周宁县苎园坪村。这里的人民正在胜利地建设着自己的新生活。
    穿过许多密林和山道，走到谷底。带路的一个青年农民向对山一声长长的呼啸，招呼对面放过木排来，让我们渡过那滚滚奔流的大溪。在大溪对面的白云山脚下，就是这个英雄的村庄——苎园坪。
    一
    苎园坪村是个十八户的小村，十六户是苗族人民，只有两户是汉族人民。在许多年代以前，先辈们用自己的双手在海拔一千多公尺的火成岩山地上的乱石缝里，开垦出一小块一小块的耕地。他们日日夜夜同山猪、山羊和成群的野兽搏斗，逐渐立定脚跟，在这里生活下去。
    但是，反动的统治者也随着把血手伸进这深山里来，霸占了这一带人民的田地，把高租重利苛捐杂税加到他们的头上。解放前除了一户中农保有两亩地外，其他十七户贫农没有一分田地。
    十多年来，全村除了到周宁买点盐以外，没有买过一尺布或其他工业品。全年极少时间能吃上大米。有六个月时间都是吃红薯干。从春天到夏天，五个月都闹粮荒，家家户户只得在荒山野地里挖野草吃。冬天雪满山的时候，各家都是围火度夜，有的盖着蓑衣，或抱着火笼睡觉。
    在大溪边挖茹蓝的时候，在高山顶采摘春茶的时候，人们时常唱起一首一首的山歌，诉说这生活的苦难：
    “周宁有三宝，红薯当粮草，蓑衣当棉袄，虱子满身跑！”“昨天吃的苦麻叶，今天吃的苦麻杆；走到半路要打你，要想抬手没气力！”
    二
    一九三三年，当共产党人来到这个村子以后，汉人和苗人曾团结在党的周围，组织农会、儿童团，掩护着红军游击队让红军游击队有效地打击敌人。
    苎园坪地形很适于防守。村前是王溪河的急流。这溪流切断了和周宁的通道，没有木排敌人就过不来。后面是气势雄伟的白云山，红军游击队可以随时进入深山密林。每当红军游击队在村里落脚的时候，苎园坪村的人总是日夜守望着。溪边像一头雄狮似的山峰名叫狮珑，红军游击队曾经在这里不断地打击敌人。有一次曾以一排人打退国民党匪军一营人。
    现任福建福安军分区司令员陈挺，当时在这里打游击。有一次他被敌人追到一个岩石洞里，腿上中了两颗子弹，鲜血不住地流。但和他一道的几个汉人和苗人英勇地掩护了他，打退了敌人，使他从敌人的包围圈里安全地撤了出来。
    敌人十分仇视苎园坪村的群众。一九三六年八月，国民党匪徒把苎园坪村的许多人抓去，把他们关了七八天，每天拷问红军的下落。苎园坪的苗族和汉族的人民，虽然明明知道红军就在白云山深处的某一处所，但不肯吐露半句实情。老“交通”郑步满说：“他们打得硬，我们的心更硬！”他的弟弟郑步真被抓进去四次，每次都被打得不成人样，但国民党匪帮不能从他嘴里得到任何东西。一九三七年春天又抓去十一个人，郑步满的老母亲也在里面。他老人家被打得走都走不动了，但坚决不告诉国民党匪帮任何消息。
    苗族妇女蓝石妃回忆说，一九三六年八月二十五日清早，大家正忙着割稻子。柿洋反动地主陈为经和陈守万带了一百多匪兵从后门山上下来，龙亭反动地主萧志何带了一路匪兵七八十人从对面陈家山方向过来，气势汹汹地包围了整个村子。把留在家里的十一个人捆起来毒打了一阵，带走了；又抢劫了许多东西；然后架起柴火，把全村都烧得光光的，只有村尾还留下一间房子，还是躲在屋后的人把火灭掉的。匪兵退走以后，从山上回来的人，都集中在这间房子里。男女老幼望着这一片废墟，心里是说不尽的仇恨和愤怒。留在地方上活动的共产党人，鼓励他们：“不要紧，烧了重来。”大家就在党的领导下，到山上砍伐树木，到岭上割野草，自己动手打土墙。不到一个月，又在废墟上重建起一排排的茅屋。反动派一看，气坏了。十月十八日，陈家山反动地主陈开健带领了更多的人来放火。这场火更大，把半边山都烧红了。全村连一根本头都没有留下。从山里归来的人们打扫了火场，拿出过去“打土豪”分来的两床棉被给妇女小孩盖，大伙集体睡在露天里，各乡农民兄弟又远道派人送东西来。地方党的同志把大家集合起来说：“没关系，再来。”苎园坪人民于是又在废墟上搭起草棚，架起茅楼，以同样的热忱招待自己的亲人——红军游击队。
    反革命分子陈开健在溪对面看见苎园坪的人又把新居建立起来了，他切齿地说：“好，你们修多少次，我就烧多少次。”十二月十六日，人们正准备过年的时候，这一群匪徒从福安、周宁、寿宁几路打来，又举火烧了这些新建的家园，连后门山上的林木都烧完了。
    在红军走后的灾难岁月里，苎园坪的人民牢记着叶飞同志临行时曾对他们说过的话：“要集中，要团结，不要分散。革命是有失败的，但一定会成功！”这些话成为这里人民坚持斗争的力量。反动派用血腥的手移民并村，不许他们在原地居住。他们有的到深山里去了，有的流浪到建瓯、崇安，有的躲在岩石底下。但是，苎园坪村人对共产党的信赖，以及从这种信赖所产生的力量，却像流不干的水，扑不灭的火。蓝石妃回忆说：“那时候，国民党白匪说我们是土匪，不准我们在苎园坪居住，我们被赶到岩石底下，全村人睡、住、吃，都在一起。下雪了，烧起一堆火；没有锅，把冷饭放在瓦片上用火笼来烤热，一口一口喂给孩子吃。生活是这样的困苦，但是全村十来年没有一个叛徒，一直坚持着斗争。直到解放前夕，国民党匪帮如果没有武装保护，总不敢轻易到这个山乡里来。”
    苎园坪人一直在等待共产党回来，等待红军回来。妇女们在繁重的劳动中唱着：
    “我拿起锄头开了路，我们等了又等；青草生起来遮满了路，还看不到回来的人影！”
    三
    一九四九年，周宁解放了。苎园坪的人民日夜盼望着的共产党人终于回来了，他们终于解放了。近两年间，这个荒凉的山村变成了欢乐的新农村。新建立的两幢漂亮坚实的大房子，放射着新生的光彩。上下两层，五十六个房间，全村人都可以住下了。新的杉木散发着清香，许多新的家门上贴着鲜红的对联，挂着绿色的菖蒲。那个声言“修多少烧多少”的恶霸地主陈开健，受到了人民正义的惩罚，在一九五二年初春被判处了死刑。
    苗族妇女蓝石妃对我们说：“去年真是双喜临门：土地回老家，房屋也修起来了，我们到底争了一口气回来了。”雷大旺家一连五六年都是住的破茅草架，每逢下雨，屋里就成了一滩稀泥浆。他搬进新居的时候，叫村里识字的人给写了一副鲜红的对联张贴起来：“大厦落成，恩感英明毛主席；国家胜利，功归勇敢解放军。”郑步满和我们在新居的楼上谈话的时候，意味深长地说：“烧房子的陈开健给我们办了！我们的新房子又修起来了。”
    从一九三六年红军北上后，他们就没有买过一尺布；但去年一下子就买了十七匹。全村都做了新衣裳，多的每人有两三件，少的也有一件。解放前全村找不到一条棉被，去年全村有了二十一条棉被。全村还有了三十只羊。郑步满笑着告诉我们：“羊群都是解放后才买的。大小羊一起算，自己有十二只了。”解放前全村只有二十多只鸡，现在已经有七十三只了。解放前没有猪、兔、鸭，现在有了六只鸭，七口猪，二十只兔。他们计划今年再增加四口猪、二十只鸡、十只鸭。
    生活的改善，是在党和人民政府的领导扶助的结果。解放前全村只有一户中农有两亩田，现在经过土地改革，共分到一百四十亩水稻田。他们开始以旺盛的热情在自己的土地上耕作。我们到村的时候正是早晨，除了到溪边来热情地迎接我们几个人以外，成年男子全下地了。只有几个苗族妇女在清亮的溪水边洗衣服，深山密林里传来丁丁的伐木声。半山悬崖上几个苗族妇女正快手快脚地采摘二春茶。在屋后的崖石上，一些小孩子正在晒茶叶。郑步满解放前种着人家四亩田，好年成一秋只收七百来斤谷，交租就要交四百五十斤。但去年一下就收入八百八十多斤。今年呢，他说：“增产一成不成问题。”全村今年的要求是水稻增产一成，红薯增产一成半。他们组织了两个初级互助组，全村劳动力差不多全部参加了。三月底以前就挖了一百三十多亩稻根。往年只翻一次土，今年翻了两次，而且翻得深。以前插秧到夏至还完不了，今年到芒种就基本完成了。解放前用肥料很少很少，今年积了一百零五担人粪，两百担草木灰。
    副业生产也大大发展了。解放前，全村只能收干毛茶三四百斤，茶山都荒芜了。解放后，人民政府发了一批茶贷，又给茶叶找到了销路，农民开始积极地整理茶山。去年就采制了毛茶二十三担，使全村人民得到了八百多万元人民币的收入。今年呢，单是首春茶就收了十八担，二春茶预计还可以收十一二担。全村今年新种植了三千多株茶树。茶粮比价：解放前大约是一和三之比，如今一般是一和六之比了。苗家妇女唱道：
    “对山有茶树，春来叶青青；今年茶叶价钱好，毛主席恩情似海深！”
