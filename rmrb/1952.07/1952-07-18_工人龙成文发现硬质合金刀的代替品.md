Worker Long Chengwen, a young worker in the Second Workshop of a factory in Northeast China, made a tool bit out of gritstone on June 12 to replace cemented carbide cutting tools for high-speed cutting. After seven on-site tests and demonstrations personally supervised by leading cadres from the factory's Party, administration, labor union, Communist Youth League, and relevant departments, it was proven that gritstone could not only machine iron, aluminum, and brass, but also ordinary steel products. Furthermore, it could cut threads of two centimeters, producing bright and smooth products. Therefore, it can completely replace cemented carbide cutting tools, opening up a new and important avenue for the country to increase production and practice economy.

After Long Chengwen introduced this discovery at the Fourth Youth Workers' Representative Conference in Shenyang on June 16, workers in the tool workshop of the No. 7 Machinery Factory also conducted experiments. They experimented with steel material with a diameter of 45 mm, a headstock speed of 1,200 revolutions per minute, a depth of cut of 2.8 cm, and a feed rate of 0.025 cm per revolution, with a cutting speed of 169.65 meters per minute. The results of both cuts were very good. The Shenyang Tram Factory also successfully experimented and improved work efficiency several times over. For example, in the past, when drawing tram axles, the machine tool was 20 revolutions per minute; using a stone tool to machine the axle, the machine tool could be increased to 300 revolutions per minute.

The economic value of Long Chengwen's discovery is very significant. Cemented carbide cutting tools are the main tools for high-speed cutting. Currently, our country does not manufacture many, and some still need to be purchased from abroad. When our country is universally promoting the high-speed cutting method, we are feeling that cemented carbide cutting tools are not enough; some factories cannot promote the high-speed cutting method because they cannot buy cemented carbide cutting tools. Long Chengwen's discovery solved this difficult problem. Gritstone is available everywhere in our country. For example, gritstone is mixed in with the stones used to build the foundations for asphalt roads and houses. Especially on the beaches, such stones are the most numerous and the best because they have not been exposed to the sun for a long time, nor have they been impacted.

According to the preliminary test results of a certain factory, the resistance of gritstone is very high (hardness is 110 degrees, which is 20 degrees higher than the hardness of cemented carbide cutting tools), and it can withstand high temperatures (the tool tip does not become blunt when the iron filings turn red). Its weaknesses are: high brittleness, not resistant to impact, and cannot be wetted when hot. Therefore, in order to maintain the life of the tool, the following points must be noted: (1) When cutting, the feed rate should be small, the depth of cut should be large, and the machine tool speed should be fast. (2) Do not block the tip of the tool with iron filings. (3) Before retracting the tool, turn off the machine first, then retract the tool. (4) When working or when the tool is still hot, do not apply oil or water, and do not touch it with your hands. (5) The angle of the tool should follow the style of cemented carbide cutting tools and should not be ground too sharp. (6) When grinding on a diamond grinding wheel, it must be dry grinding, use light force, and do not touch water, oil, or fire.

### 工人龙成文发现硬质合金刀的代替品

    工人龙成文发现硬质合金刀的代替品
    东北某厂第二车间青年工人龙成文，在六月十二日利用砂砾岩制成工具刀，以代替硬质合金刀，实行高速切削。经过这个厂的党、行政、工会、青年团及有关部门的领导干部亲自掌握试验表演七次，证明了砂砾岩不但可以车铁、铝、黄铜，而且能车一般钢料产品，同时能挑两个糎的丝扣，车出的产品又亮又光。因而它完全可以代替硬质合金刀。这给国家增产节约开辟了一个新的重要的途径。
    六月十六日，龙成文在沈阳市第四次青工代表会议上介绍了这一发现以后，机械七厂工具车间工人，也进行了试验。他们试验的工作物是直径四十五公厘的钢料，床头转速每分钟一千二百转，吃刀量二点八糎，每转送刀量零点零二五糎，切削速度每分钟一六九点六五公尺。切削两次，成绩都很好。沈阳电车厂也试验成功，并且提高工作效率好几倍。如他们过去抽电车轴杠，机床每分钟是二十转；用石头刀车轴杠，机床可以提高到每分钟三百转。
    龙成文的这一发现的经济价值是十分重大的。硬质合金刀是高速切削的主要工具，目前我国制造的不多，有一部分还需要从国外买来。我国在普遍推广高速切削法的时候，正在感到硬质合金刀不够用；有些工厂因买不到硬质合金刀而不能推广高速切削法。龙成文的这一发现，解决了这个困难问题。砂砾岩在我国到处都有，如修建柏油马路和修建房屋所用的打地基的石头里，都夹有砂砾岩。尤其在海滩上，这样的石头最多，也最好，因为它没有被太阳久晒过，同时也没被撞动过。
    根据某厂的初步化验结果，砂砾岩的抗力非常大（硬度为一百一十度，比硬质合金刀的硬度高二十度），能耐高温（铁沫红了的时候，刀头亦不变钝）。它的弱点是：脆性大，不耐碰撞，高热的时候不能浸湿。因此，为了保持刀的寿命，必须注意几件事：（一）切削时，送刀量要小，吃刀量大一点，机床转数快一点。（二）不要把车出的铁沫堵塞刀尖。（三）退刀前，先关车，后退刀。（四）车活时，或者刀还热的时候，不准涂油涂水，不准用手去摸。（五）刀的角度要按照硬质合金刀样式，不得磨得太尖。（六）在金钢砂轮上研磨时，必须要干磨，要用力轻，不得沾水、沾油、沾火。
