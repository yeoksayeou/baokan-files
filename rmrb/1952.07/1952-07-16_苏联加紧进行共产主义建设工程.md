(Xinhua News Agency, July 12th) According to TASS: The Soviet Union's great communist construction projects are being accelerated, and construction workers are achieving successive successes.

    The recently completed Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal was officially opened to traffic in June. In one month, approximately two hundred ships carrying tens of thousands of tons of cargo have passed through this canal. Many new river transport stations and wharves have been built along the canal. In addition to the Krasnoarmeysk River Transport Station and the Kalach River Transport Station, the Tsimlyansk River Transport Station has also been completed. At the "Tsimlyansk Sea," the world's largest artificial reservoir, the second turbine of the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station has begun generating electricity, and the installation of the third turbine is continuing. The water from the Tsimlyansk Sea has already irrigated many collective farm fields, and these lands have yielded bountiful harvests. Due to the successful completion of the construction project, trains at the construction site are now constantly transporting various machines and equipment to other construction areas. Workers, engineers, and technicians are also transferring to new areas to work.
    The construction workers of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station have completed the water-resisting weir project for the downstream navigation lock on the left bank of the Volga River. More than one million cubic meters of soil have been piled up to form a water-resisting weir twenty meters high and four thousand seven hundred meters long. On the right bank of the Volga River, workers are excavating the foundation pit for the power plant and piling up an eight-kilometer-long water-resisting weir. The nine-hundred-kilometer-long high-voltage power line connecting Kuibyshev and Moscow is being erected at an accelerated pace. Many new residential areas and auxiliary enterprises have appeared on both banks of the Volga River. Now, construction workers are holding a socialist competition to complete eight months of construction and assembly plans before August 15th.
    At the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, construction work has entered the stage of large-scale main project execution. A water-resisting weir protecting the foundation of the power plant and the spillway has been piled up to a length of one thousand three hundred meters. Auxiliary enterprises are being built near the construction site. A huge machine repair plant has partially started operations, the tower of the concrete mixing plant has been erected, and the construction of the asphalt manufacturing plant is also nearing completion. At another major project, the Stalingrad Grand Canal construction site, workers have excavated more than one hundred thousand cubic meters of soil. When completed, this canal will be six times longer than the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal, will flow through the area between the Volga and Ural Rivers, and will irrigate seven and a half million hectares of land.
    In the area of the Turkmen Grand Canal, the longest canal in the contemporary world, the surveying and research work to determine the canal route is nearing completion. The main project of the sluice gate of the hydroelectric station on the Amu Darya River will begin construction in the coming days. Now, the canal's construction headquarters, Takhta-Tash, is very lively, and telephones and airplanes are connecting it with many survey teams working along the canal. Dozens of large trucks loaded with various machines and equipment are moving forward, separating sand dunes in the Kara-Kum Desert. A row of houses, auxiliary enterprises, and social service institutions have been built in the northern section of the canal, and the city of Kasandzhik is being built in the southern section.
    More than nine hundred construction sites have appeared along the South Ukraine Canal and the North Crimean Canal. A huge reservoir is being built in the South Ukraine Canal area. The construction workers of the North Crimean Canal are excavating a huge embankment in Simferopol to build a reservoir with a capacity of three thousand cubic meters. The construction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station is also being accelerated. Before the autumn of this year, construction workers will complete the work of excavating ditches for the power plant and piling up water-resisting weirs.

    苏联加紧进行共产主义建设工程
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程正在加紧进行，建筑工人获得了接二连三的成就。
    最近完工的列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河已在六月间正式通航。一月来已有约二百艘船只装着数万吨货物驶过这条运河。运河沿线已经修建了许多新的河运站和码头，除了红军城河运站和卡拉奇河运站之外，齐姆良河运站也完工了。在世界上最大的人工水库“齐姆良海”，齐姆良水电站的第二座透平已经开始发电，第三座透平的安装工作正在继续进行。齐姆良海的水已经灌溉了许多集体农场的田地，这些土地上都获得了丰收。由于建设工程的胜利完成，最近工地上的火车正在川流不息地把各种机器和设备运到其他工程地带。工人、工程师和技术人员也随着转移到新的地区工作。
    古比雪夫水电站的建筑工人已经完成了伏尔加河左岸下游航行水门拒水堰的工程，一百多万公方的泥土已堆成了一个二十公尺高和四千七百公尺长的拒水堰。在伏尔加河右岸，工人们正在挖掘电力厂的基坑和堆砌八公里长的拒水堰。连接古比雪夫和莫斯科的九百公里长的高压电线正在加速架设。伏尔加河两岸已经出现了许多新的住宅区和辅助企业。现在，建筑工人正在举行社会主义竞赛，争取在八月十五日以前完成八个月的建筑和装配计划。
    在斯大林格勒水电站的工地上，建筑工作已经进入大规模进行主要工程的阶段。一道保护电力厂和放水堰基脚的拒水堰已经堆砌了一千三百公尺长。工地附近正在加紧建设辅助企业。一个巨大的机器修理厂已经部分开工，混凝土掺合工厂的高塔已经竖立起来，沥青制造厂的建筑工程也即将完成。在另一个主要工程——斯大林格勒大运河工地上，工人们已挖去了十万立方公尺以上的泥土。这条运河完成之后将比列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河长六倍，将流经伏尔加河与乌拉尔河之间的地区，使七百五十万公顷土地有水灌溉。
    在当代世界最长的运河——土库曼大运河地区，确定运河路线的测量和研究工作即将结束。阿姆河上水电站的水闸主要工程就要在日内开工。现在运河的建设总部——塔赫亚·塔什非常热闹，电话和飞机正把它和许多在运河沿线工作的考察队联系着。几十部装着各种机器和设备的大卡车，正在卡拉·库姆沙漠分开沙丘前进。运河的北段已经建筑了一排排的住宅、辅助企业和社会服务机关，运河的南段正在建设卡桑吉克城。
    南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河沿线已经出现了九百多个建筑工地。南乌克兰运河地区正在建筑一个巨大的水库。北克里米亚运河的建筑工人正在森佛罗波尔挖掘一道庞大的堤堰，以便建筑有三千立方公尺容积的水库。卡霍夫卡水电站的工程也在加紧进行中，在今年秋季以前，建筑工人将完成为电力厂挖掘水沟和堆砌拒水堰的工作。
