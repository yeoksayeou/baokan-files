Since entering the Southwest, our troops have done a lot of work and achieved great results. For example, we have annihilated millions of bandits, reformed nearly a million Kuomintang troops, participated in land reform, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the advance into Tibet, democratic movements, the purge of troop organizations, the "Three-Anti" movement, and a series of military and political struggles and mass movements. Our troops' literary and art workers have generally participated in these, and have played a certain role and achieved certain results in these movements (i.e., personal development and improvement of varying degrees), which should be affirmed first. But on the other hand, our literary and art work is far behind the objective situation and the demands of soldiers and cadres. The problems exposed by the cultural departments in the current "Three-Anti" movement are generally quite serious. The main reason is that in the two years since entering the city, they have been eroded by bourgeois ideology, their own organizational composition and ideology are complex, and their transformation is insufficient, resulting in weak resistance. In addition, there is serious bureaucracy in the leadership, creating large loopholes in the work, especially in financial work, allowing enemies to exploit them. For example, the film section of the Cultural Department of the Southwest Military Region was deceived by merchants of 1.6 billion yuan to purchase developing machines and other equipment in Hong Kong, and they are still avoiding contact. The serious situation of individual cadres being hit by "sugar-coated bullets" shows that illegal bourgeois elements regard our cultural departments as important targets of attack. Due to the above reasons, we have conducted profound inspections and education in the "Three-Anti" struggle, and have begun to overcome and correct them, which is a great victory for us.

Our current central task is the construction of a modern and regular national defense force. A series of measures adapted to this, such as reorganizing troops, cultural education, Party consolidation and education, organizing and training militia, and training cadres, are all to achieve this overall goal. Therefore, our literary and art work must also arrange its work around this center. The main task this year is to cooperate with cultural learning, which is a necessary condition for strengthening national defense construction, mastering modern technical equipment, and improving the level of political theory. All aspects of the army must redouble their efforts to eliminate illiteracy and improve culture, while also taking into account future development.

Based on the above situation, how should we deploy our cultural and artistic work?

Meet the Needs of Soldiers, Resolve to Go to the Companies

All performing arts troupes (teams), film projection teams, and working cadres of cultural departments should go to work in the companies without exception, and resolutely implement the cultural and artistic work policy of "orienting towards companies and serving soldiers" without any wavering. We must fully recognize the seriousness of our detachment from the troops; "orienting towards companies" should become our long-term working principle. Otherwise, we will not only be detached from the masses, but we will also fail to transform and improve ourselves.

What should we do when we go to the companies? First of all, we must deeply and comprehensively understand the companies. Chairman Mao taught us to understand various situations and be familiar with various things in the army. Understanding various situations, being familiar with various things, understanding various people, and being familiar with various people requires a lot of work, and this work is the primary work. The company is the basic unit of the army, and understanding and being familiar with the company is paramount. Otherwise, we will not be able to work with our work objects, and we will not be able to write about our work objects. To understand and be familiar with the company, we must also assist the company commander and political instructor in their work and carry out cultural and recreational activities in the company. We must understand and be familiar with the company through work, otherwise we will not be able to understand and be familiar with the company. Only when the company work is done well and we are well trained in the company can we say that we have a little capital and a little ability. True ability and capital should and must come from the masses and go to the masses.

Going down is not easy, of course, today's environment and conditions are much better than in the past. But going down to the company is much harder than working in the office. Life is tense, and we must integrate with the masses. This is an arduous struggle process. We subjectively think that we can quickly get what we need when we go to the company, but we cannot get it immediately after we go down; or we think we have got it, but when we come back, we find that it is still fragmented. How to transform from arduous struggle to physical and mental pleasure is a process of struggle and transformation.

Going down to the company, we will also encounter many difficulties in our work. The work you want to do may not be noticed by the company commander, political instructor, and comrades immediately. First, they will see if you are patient in the company and whether you can help them with what they are busy with. Otherwise, they may send you back. But we cannot conclude that the company commander and political instructor are wrong, but we must make sure that we are not sent back and that we are liked by the company.

The company does not have a full-time club director, so we must learn to do mass work and be good at using activists. Many of our comrades used to use the administrative orders of the office to do their work, and they were not good at mobilizing and organizing the masses. This is also a difficulty. The company has a central task and time is tight. Your work may not be able to cooperate immediately, and there is not enough time to do mass work.

All these show that going down to the company requires a great determination. Without determination, we cannot go down, and we cannot do it well even if we go down. Everyone should not think that going down to the company is easy. Even comrades who have been working in the office for a long time cannot immediately pack their bags and leave once they go down. They still have to explore for a few days, but as long as they are determined, they can go down and do it well.

Literary and art cadres and working comrades must face the companies, and cultural activities funds must also go to the companies. According to the regulations of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, half of the cultural activities funds of the entire army this year must be effectively used for the soldiers in the companies, which is basically for the companies. This is not just a matter of stipulating how much money to give to the companies and how many supplies to provide. It is necessary to stipulate a standard and provide a guarantee. But it is more necessary to help the company use the money well, supply the supplies in a timely and suitable manner, and meet the needs of the company without wasting. An irresponsible attitude of distributing the money without care or organizing their activities, neither using it nor managing it, will cause great losses.

It is right to purchase cultural supplies centrally by the supply and marketing cooperatives to avoid all business departments using money. Centralized distribution of supplies by the division and the military region does not mean that the military regions and the armies are not responsible. This only reduces the procurement, distribution, transfer, and other administrative work of the military regions and armies, but the responsibility for ensuring good distribution, good storage, and good use has not been reduced at all.

In addition, the supplies should also be budgeted according to the existing construction and standards of the troops, not everything should start from scratch. If the items stipulated in the standards have been built, the new budget should be transferred to other cultural construction that is beneficial to the troops, so as not to waste. We must investigate the prices and transportation conditions in various places, and buy where it is cheaper, so as to avoid wasteful transportation. This is what the supply and marketing cooperatives should master well, and should not be regarded as just administrative work. This is a matter of mass welfare. As for transportation costs, military transportation and other transportation should be used as much as possible. All logistics departments and transportation departments should not fail to provide convenience when they see that there are cultural activities funds. If it is really necessary to pay for transportation, the budget should be made within the cultural activities funds and transported in time, so as to avoid delays and prevent the troops, especially the frontier troops, from receiving the supply of cultural products for a long time. (The transportation costs of the performing arts troupes should be included in the troop transportation costs)

Appropriately Solve the Cultural Life Problems of Cadres

The working principle for the coming year is to focus on the companies, but at the same time, we must appropriately solve the cultural life problems of cadres. How to properly solve this problem? The clubs above the division level must pay attention to the work of the cadre clubs and organize activities suitable for cadres. To do this work well, we must first investigate the preferences of cadres and organize possible activities according to their preferences. We cannot simplify the activities of cadres to only dancing. If so, the work of the club has not played a role. For example, many cadres like to play ball games, so we should organize ball games for cadres; those who like to watch ball games should regularly organize better amateur teams in the troops to hold performances or competitions, and we can also invite teams from outside the troops to hold friendly matches; those who like to play chess should organize chess competitions. When holding competitions in the club, we should set up places for the audience to watch. Other activities such as table tennis, billiards, and curling are all activities that can be set up and organized at any time in the cadre club. In addition, we can organize cadres to watch movies, watch acrobatic performances, bicycle competitions, visit cultural relics and monuments, factories and enterprises, and study modern weapons. These are all the businesses of the cadre club. In addition to providing business guidance to lower-level clubs, cadre club activities are a major content of clubs above the division level, while the activities of soldiers, in addition to large-scale collective activities, can be mainly assigned to the clubs of directly subordinate units.

The cultural, entertainment, and sports activities of cadres cannot be completely separated from these activities of soldiers. Cadres also work for soldiers. If the work of cadres is done well, it will play a great role in promoting and leading the activities of soldiers.

Solve the Contradiction of Having Few People and Many Things, Learn to Do Mass Work,
Take the Mass Line

After the reorganization, very few performing arts troupes were left, and the number of personnel in cultural departments and clubs was also small. The issue of "mass nature" has become prominent. If we still rely on the cadres of the cultural departments to carry out cultural activities, it will not work. We must mobilize and organize the masses, rely on the strength of the Youth League, and obtain cooperation from all parties. Therefore, we must work for the masses, the Youth League, and all parties. When your work has not been done, you will see that you are isolated and weak, all parties do not pay attention to your work, it is difficult to cooperate, and you feel that it is difficult to do things without increasing people. This is because you have not passed the first hurdle yet; this hurdle must be passed before the combat effectiveness and mass nature of our literary and art work can appear. As Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping said, it is called "being forced to take the mass line." Only in this way can the combat effectiveness and mass nature of our literary and art work appear.

Solve the Problems of Popularization and Improvement, Creation and Ideological Transformation, etc.

In the second half of last year, our cultural work carried out popularization work, creation, and ideological transformation, and achieved some results in these three aspects. However, because the policy of "orienting towards companies and serving soldiers" was not resolutely implemented, we failed to organize all forces to combine the three and implement them in the action of "orienting towards companies." Therefore, cultural popularization work only became the work of some people, and creation activities were separated from it. The performing arts troupes also did not transform their ideology in the process of popularization and creation in the direction of the company. Some only transformed behind closed doors. As a result, their ideology was not transformed well, popularization work was not done, and works could not be written or were useless even if they were written, and therefore could not be improved. In the future, the focus will be on the company, and everyone will go to the company. Then these three must be solved under the policy of "orienting towards the company." That is: go down to do popularization work, creation is also for the masses and for popularization, and transform ideology and improve business in the process of such work.

Reorganize Performing Arts Troupes, Strengthen the Cadres of Cultural Departments

Performing arts troupes should be dealt with appropriately. The principles of treatment are: 1. First, replenish the cultural, propaganda, and youth departments at all levels according to the establishment; 2. Strengthen the retained performing arts troupes; 3. Supplement cultural instructors. In addition to these, they can be transferred to other work, preferably organized and reorganized centrally by the military region.

After the reorganization, the institutions and personnel of the cultural departments have been reduced, and the cadres must be strengthened. The original cultural work cadres must first be used to replenish the cultural departments, and the cadres of the cultural sections of the divisions and the clubs of the regiments must be strengthened. The director of the regimental club should be staffed by a battalion-level or deputy battalion-level cadre, projectionists should be selected and trained, and photography can be organized on an amateur basis but tasks must be given. These amateur photographers should preferably be related to propaganda and cultural work, and the regimental club can temporarily entrust them to take photos. The performing arts troupes must concentrate good actors, singers, bands, directors, and administrative cadres.

To face the companies, we must first train the directors of the regimental clubs and the backbone of the companies well. The directors of the regimental clubs are trained by the major military regions, and the backbone of the companies is trained by the divisions and regiments.

    把“面向连队、为兵服务”的文艺方针坚持贯彻下去
    人民解放军西南军区政治部副主任
    王新亭
    进入西南以来，我们的部队是作了很多事情的，并且获得很大成绩。例如剿灭百万土匪，改造近百万国民党的部队，参加土地改革、抗美援朝、进军西藏、民主运动、清理部队组织、“三反”运动等等一系列的军事政治斗争和群众运动，我们部队的文艺工作者一般都是参加了的，并且在这些运动中都起到一定的作用，获得一定的成绩（即对个人来说也都有程度大小不同的锻炼和提高），这是首先应该肯定的。但在另一方面，我们的文艺工作还远远落后于客观形势和战士干部的要求。在此次“三反”运动中，文化部门暴露出的问题一般都相当严重。主要是在进入城市之后最近两年当中受资产阶级思想的侵蚀，而本身组织成分思想也很复杂，改造不够，抵抗力薄弱；加之领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，造成在工作中特别在财经工作中很大的漏洞，使敌人有空可钻，有隙可乘。例如西南军区文化部电影科被商人拐骗十六亿巨款到香港购买冲洗机等器材，至今避而不见，以及个别干部被
    “糖衣炮弹”打中的严重情况，说明不法资产阶级分子把我们文化部门也是当作重要的进攻对象和目标看待的。由于上述原因，在“三反”斗争中我们作了深刻的检查和教育，并开始得到克服与纠正，这是我们很大的胜利。
    我们当前的中心任务是现代化、正规化国防军的建设。与此相适应的整编部队、文化教育、整党教育、组训民兵、训练干部等一系列的措施，都是为了达到这一总的目的，因此我们的文艺工作也必须围绕这一中心来布置自己的工作。今年一年的任务主要是配合文化学习，这是加强国防军建设，掌握现代技术装备，提高政治理论水平所必须具备的条件。全军各个方面都必须加倍努力为消除文盲，提高文化而斗争，但同时也要照顾到未来的发展。
    根据上述情况，应该怎样来部署我们的文化艺术工作呢？
    满足战士的需要，决心下连队
    所有文工团（队）、电影队、文化部门的工作干部应毫无例外地去作连队工作，贯彻“面向连队、为兵服务”的文化艺术工作方针，必须十分坚决，不可有任何动摇。要充分认识我们脱离部队的严重性；“面向连队”应成为我们长期的工作方针。不这样，不仅脱离群众，而且本身也得不到改造和提高。
    下连队干什么？首先要深入地全面地去了解连队。毛主席教导我们要在部队里了解各种情况，熟悉各种事情。了解各种人，熟悉各种人，需要作很大的工作，这个工作是首要的工作。而连队是部队的基本单位，了解与熟悉连队是首要的，不然就无法对我们的工作对象进行工作，也会无法写我们的工作对象。要了解与熟悉连队，还必须协助连长指导员进行工作，开展连队的文化娱乐活动，从工作中去了解与熟悉连队，否则是无法了解与熟悉连队的，只有连队工作作好了，在连队里锻炼好了，才能说有了一点本钱和一点本事。真正的本事本钱应该而且必须是从群众中来到群众中去。
    下去也不是很容易的，当然今天的环境和条件比过去已经好得多。但下到连队去比在机关还是苦得多，生活紧张，要和群众打成一片，这是一个艰苦的斗争过程。自己主观想到连队就很快得到自己所需要的东西，但下去之后不是马上能得到的；或者以为自己得到了，回来一看还是很片断的零碎的。怎样从艰苦斗争转入身心愉快，就是一个斗争过程，改造过程。
    下连队去，在工作上也要碰到许多困难，你要去作的工作不一定马上能得到，连长指导员和同志们的注意，首先还看你在连队里住得耐烦不耐烦，对他们正在忙着的事情有帮助没有，不然他们还可能打发你回来的；但不能就得出结论说连长指导员态度不对，而要自己作到不给打发回来，作到为连队所喜欢。
    连队没有专职的俱乐部主任，就必须学会作群众工作，善于运用积极分子。而我们许多同志过去往往是运用机关行政命令的方式去作工作，不善于发动与组织群众，这也是困难；连队有中心任务，时间很紧，你的工作不一定马上能配合得上去，作群众工作也不是有那样充分的时间。
    这些都说明下连队非有很大的决心是下不去的，没有决心，下去也作不好。大家不要认为下连队轻而易举，甚至长期在机关工作的同志一旦下去也还不能马上背起背包就走，还得摸索几天，但只要有决心是能够下得去，而且也是能够作好的。
    文艺干部和工作同志要面向连队，文化活动经费也要下连队。按军委总政治部规定今年全军文化活动费必须有一半切实用到连队战士身上，这也是基本上为连队的。这就不只是规定给连队发多少钱，供应多少东西的问题，这方面规定一个标准，给予保证是必要的。但更需要帮助连队把钱用好，供应品供应得及时合用，能满足连队需要而又不浪费，这是一个极其复杂细致的工作。发下去不管，或发下去不组织他们的活动，既不使用又无人管理，这种不负责任的态度是会造成很大损失的。
    集中文化用品由供应社采购是对的，避免各业务部门都用钱，集中师和大军区发供应品，并不等于说各军区和军就不负责了；这只是减轻了各军区、各军的采购分发转运等事务工作，而保证发好，保管好，使用好，这方面的责任是一点也没有减轻的。
    此外，供应品还应根据部队已有的建设和标准来造预算，不是一切都从头来。标准上规定的项目已建设了的，就应把新的经费预算转到其他为部队有益的文化建设上去，才不致浪费。要调查各地的物价与运输条件，那里便宜就在那里买，以免辗转运输造成浪费，这是供应社应很好掌握的，不要看成这只是事务工作，这是群众福利问题。至于运输费，凡军运及其他交通上能捎带的就应当尽量捎带，各后勤部门运输部门不应看到有文化活动费就不给予便利。真正需要出费运输的，就应把预算作在文化活动费内及时运走，以免拖延时日，使部队特别是边疆部队很久得不到文化品的供应。（文工团的交通费应列在部队运输费以内）
    适当解决干部的文化生活问题
    今后一年的工作方针是重点放在连队，但同时必须适当解决干部文化生活的问题。如何适当解决这个问题呢？师以上的俱乐部必须注意把干部俱乐部的工作搞起来，组织适合于干部的活动。要作好这一工作，首先要调查干部的喜好，根据其喜好去组织可能的活动，不能把干部的活动简单化为只有跳舞。如果这样，就是俱乐部的工作还没有起到作用。比如：干部中有许多喜欢打球的，应组织干部中的球赛；喜欢看打球的，就要经常组织部队内较好的业余球队举行表演或比赛，还可邀请部队以外的球队进行友谊赛；有的喜欢下象棋、围棋的就组织象棋、围棋比赛，在俱乐部比赛时应设置便于观众观看的地方，其他如乒乓球、台球、克郎球等，都是在干部俱乐部中可以设置，可以组织随时比赛的；此外，组织干部看电影，看杂技表演，脚踏车竞赛，对文化古迹、工厂企业的参观，近代武器的研究等等方面，这都是干部俱乐部的业务。师以上俱乐部除了对下级俱乐部作业务指导之外，干部俱乐部活动就是一个主要内容，而战士的活动，除了大的集体活动之外，主要的可分给直属部队的俱乐部去作。
    干部的文化娱乐体育活动，不能和战士的这些活动截然分开：干部也是为战士工作的，干部的工作作好了，对推动与领导战士的活动是起很大作用的。解决人少事多的矛盾，学会作群众工作，
    走群众路线
    整编之后，文工团大都留下的很少，文化部门俱乐部的人员也是不多的，“群众性”的问题就突出了。如果还只是依靠文化部门的干部去作文化活动就不行了，必须发动与组织群众，依靠青年团的力量，取得各方面的合作，因此就必须向群众、向青年团、向各方面作工作。当你的工作没有作到的时候，你看到的是自己人单力薄，各方面不注意你的工作，很难合作，感到不增加人事情难办，这样就还没有过第一关；这个关又必须过了，才能在事多人少的情况下把工作作好。正如邓小平政委所说的叫“被迫走群众路线”，也只有这样，我们文艺工作的战斗性、群众性才能出现。
    解决普及和提高、创作和思想改造等问题
    去年下半年，我们的文化工作作了普及工作，进行了创作和思想改造，并在这三个方面都收到一些效果。但由于执行“面向连队、为兵服务”的方针不够坚决，因而未能组织全部力量在“面向连队”的行动中把三者结合起来加以贯彻，因此文化普及工作只成为一部分人的工作，创作活动与之分离。文工团队也没有在面向连队进行普及与创作的情况下去改造思想，有的只是闭门改造，结果思想没有改造好，普及工作又没有作，作品就无从写出来或者写出来也无用，因而也就不能提高。今后重点是搞连队，普遍下连，那么这三者就要在“面向连队”的方针下去解决，就是：下去作普及工作，创作也是为群众为普及，在这样的工作过程中去改造思想，去提高业务。
    整编文工团队，增强文化部门的干部
    文工团队应作适当处理，其处理原则：一、按编制首先充实各级文化、宣传、青年部门；二、加强保留的文工团队；三、补充文化教员。除此之外可转作其他工作，最好以军区为单位集中整编。
    整编之后，文化部门机构与人员缩小了，干部就必须加强。原有文化工作干部必须首先去充实文化部门，师文化科、团俱乐部的干部要加强。团俱乐部主任要配备营级或副营级干部去充任，放映人员要挑选训练，摄影可以组织一些业余的但必须给予任务，这些业余摄影人员最好是与宣传文化工作有关连的，团俱乐部可以临时委托拍照。文工团队必须集中好的演员、歌手、乐队、导演及行政干部。
    要面向连队，必须首先把团俱乐部主任及连队骨干训练好，团俱乐部主任由大军区负责训练，连队骨干由师团负责训练。
