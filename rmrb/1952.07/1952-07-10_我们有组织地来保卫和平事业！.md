    Let us organizedly defend the cause of peace!
    Ivan Grusenko, Member of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee, Scientific Secretary of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    Today, millions of people of goodwill in all countries are united under the banner of peace, forming an invincible obstacle in the path of the instigators of a new war. No war! To smash the conspiracies of the American, British, and other merchants who trade in human lives! This is the goal of the hundreds of millions of people who are united.
    The Soviet people have consistently waged a struggle for peace and friendship among all nations for thirty-five years. The struggle for lasting peace stems from the nature of the Soviet state, where there are no classes seeking to profit from war.
    Stalin's policy of peace is very clear. It is manifested not only in the declarations of Soviet representatives at various international conferences and in the United Nations General Assembly, but also in the deeds of the Soviet people and their government.
    Let me give a few examples. In the spring of 1951, a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the Law on the Protection of Peace, according to which the propagation of war is subject to severe criminal penalties.
    More than 117 million Soviet citizens, that is, all residents of the country over the age of sixteen, have signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact.
    In November 1951, the Third All-Soviet Conference for the Defense of Peace was convened, a new demonstration of our people's unwavering desire to fight for peace.
    From May 9 to May 12, 1952, at the initiative of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, the Soviet Conference of Churches and Religious Associations for Peace was held, which fully supported the World Peace Council's proposal to condemn aggression and prohibit the propagation of hostility and hatred among nations.
    Soviet scientists—heirs to the best traditions of their predecessors—together with workers, farmers, writers, teachers, engineers, pastors, and millions upon millions of people, have consistently supported peace in the past and continue to do so today.
    Lomonosov, Lobachevsky, Sechenov, Pavlov, Mendeleev, Timiryazev, Michurin, and many other Russian scientists dedicated all their activities to the happiness of mankind. They were ardent haters of everything that hindered mankind from moving towards freedom and development. The world's leading biologist, the famous Academician Pavlov, said these excellent words at the Fifteenth International Physiological Congress: "There is no need to argue: war is a barbaric method of solving life's difficulties, a method that is not commensurate with human intelligence and its inexhaustible resources."
    These glorious traditions of the giants of Russian science are sacredly observed and continued to be carried forward in the activities of Soviet scientists. Soviet biologists, physiologists, medical scientists, geologists, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and humanists see the significance of their scientific research in improving living conditions and uncovering the great secrets of nature that serve mankind.
    In capitalist countries, warmongers are preparing to use, and have already used, the achievements of physicists, biologists, and chemists to slaughter and enslave mankind. A portion of the scientists bought by warmongers are today arguing about which is a more effective tool for exterminating mankind: the atomic bomb or bacteria. One of the leaders of a Canadian bacteriological weapons laboratory declared in "Standard" magazine: "The prospect of massive annihilation of mankind is very optimistic... We can anticipate that the greatest effects will be achieved." Not long ago, the American scientist Forrestad frankly stated his opinion that in the scientific community "every penny is wasted if it is spent on anything other than the further development of destructive tools."
    American warmongers and their hired scholars are even attempting to find arguments for preparing new massacres with long-bankrupt "theories". Now, the misanthropic theories of Malthus and racists are being widely propagated.
    I am a biologist myself. Therefore, I will limit what I talk about to this science, which is now being widely used as a tool of ideological struggle and a tool of technological struggle.
    I will now cite some facts. Not long ago, in New York, a notoriously pseudo-scientific book by William Vogt, "Road to Survival," was published. This book has attracted a great deal of attention in the United States and has been recommended to readers as the best example. It is also being heavily promoted and reprinted in England. The famous American warmonger Baruch, who insisted on introducing the book and brought it to the attention of politicians around the world, wrote a preface to it. The "Road to Survival" advocated by the author is nothing new. It is Malthus' "theory," rejected by true science, "enriched" with ideas selected from the racist arsenal a long time ago.
    If Malthus preached the reduction of the birth rate, then Vogt goes a step further: he not only demands the cessation of the increase in the population of the earth, but also the reduction of the existing number of human beings. For example, he speaks of medicine as a harmful thing because it reduces the mortality rate of the working people. He considers epidemics, famines, hunger, and wars to be the happiness of mankind. He fully approves of the fascist invention—the elimination of reproductive capacity—and shamelessly promotes this "invention" widely, but, of course, to the poor strata of the population.
    Some excerpts from this book, it seems to me, are useful for understanding the extent to which the cruelty of the so-called scholars of "democratic" America has reached.
    Vogt regrets that health workers have fought against diseases in various ways, helping to reduce the mortality rate of the Latin American population, whereas in the past, these diseases were the most effective way to limit population growth.
    As for the causes of the difficult economic situation of the Indian people, Vogt does not consider it to be the result of decades of colonial exploitation of the Indian people by British colonialists, but attributes it to:
    "Indians breed with the irresponsibility of fish, according to their habits."
    After commenting on the population situation in various regions of the world, Vogt did not forget Europe, saying: "Achieving stability first, and then reducing the number of people in Europe, would be the greatest contribution to universal peace and prosperity."
    What exactly are his so-called "saving methods" that can "save mankind"?
    The main "practical" recommendation recommended by Vogt is:
    "To give a small, but sufficient amount of money to all those who agree to undergo a simple operation for the purpose of reducing fertility, especially men." Starting from racist preaching, Vogt believes:
    "From the point of view of social interests, it is always better to pay money to those poor people who are often inferior in physical and mental strength than to help their large number of children. These descendants, due to physiological and social hereditary limitations, will be useless for life."
    This is the spiritual decadence of biological science in the decadent capitalist social system, this is the bankruptcy of their ideology!
    It goes without saying that progressive scientists in all countries are denouncing such "scientific research" by traitors to science.
    In the peace camp, progressive scientists in various capitalist countries are standing shoulder to shoulder with scholars from the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies, fighting at the forefront.
    Among the greatest activists of the international peace movement, we can cite one of the most outstanding physicists of modern times, Joliot-Curie, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo, the famous female physicist Madame Cotton, Professor Kosambi of India, Professor Bernal of England, Morrison of the United States, Kerrins of Belgium, Oyama Ikuo of Japan, and others.
    We can often hear and read in the bourgeois newspapers that the Soviet Union has used an iron curtain to isolate its scientific workers from the rest of the world, and the world has been divided into East and West. The world has indeed been divided in reality, but it has not been divided into "East" and "West", but into two sides: supporters and opponents of peace. Life has proven that in any capitalist country, in addition to obscurantists like Vogt, there are also advanced peaceful laborers who are faithfully and truly serving the happiness of mankind.
    The connections between Soviet scholars and scientists of the people's democracies, and progressive scholars in capitalist countries, are growing and strengthening year by year.
    A series of international scientific workers' congresses have been held in the Soviet Union—such as the Second International Congress of Soil Scientists, the Fifteenth International Congress of Physiologists, and the Seventeenth International Congress of Geographers. Soviet botanists also participated in the Seventh International Congress of Botanists held in Stockholm in 1950.
    Our Academy of Sciences has been exchanging publications with the Royal Society of London since 1769, and with the Paris Academy of Sciences since 1841. Currently, in terms of international book exchange, our Academy of Sciences sends about 13,000 scientific books and magazines monthly through its library to more than 1,500 scientific institutions in 56 countries around the world. However, the governments of the Anglo-American aggressive blocs are obviously pursuing a policy of restricting the exchange of scientific books. In 1951, the US State Department prohibited the export of technical and natural science books to the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.
    But these kinds of measures have not been able to stop the growing friendly ties between progressive scientists and cultural activists in various countries.
    We extend our hands of friendship, respect, and mutual understanding with special sympathy to these progressive scientific and cultural workers and all peace-loving people.
    Why are the Soviet people so enthusiastic and persistent in defending the cause of peace? Are they afraid? No, definitely not. The recent bloody war launched by the fascist Hitler bandits has proven to the world that the Soviet people possess the power of eagles and the fortress of steel.
    The Soviet people advocate peace in order to prevent the culture created by mankind over many centuries from suffering from artillery fire and destruction, to prevent fathers from being maimed and killed, to prevent mothers from suffering, and to prevent children from losing their parents and becoming homeless.
    The traces of the bloody crimes of the Hitler gang are still fresh in the memory of the Soviet people.
    The German fascist plunderers inflicted huge damage on the Soviet Union. They completely or partially destroyed and burned 1,710 towns and more than 70,000 villages, destroyed 31,850 industrial enterprises, 65,000 kilometers of railway tracks, plundered and destroyed 98,000 collective farms, 1,876 state farms, and 2,890 machine tractor stations.
    Some say that numbers are not easy to remember, but the Soviet people remember them very clearly. I believe that those who sincerely do not want to see new bloodshed and new sacrifices of millions of people will always firmly remember these numbers.
    People all over the world know that the Soviet people have healed their wounds after the war and are creating epoch-making construction with their own laboring hands.
    All the Soviet people greet the Soviet government's historically significant resolutions on the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River, the South Ukraine and North Crimean irrigation canals and the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, as well as the Volga-Don navigable canal and the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric station with the greatest pride in their great motherland. These resolutions of the Soviet government simultaneously solve three problems: irrigation, power, and transportation.
    On the Volga River, in the areas of Kuibyshev and Stalingrad, the world's two largest hydroelectric power stations and two large-scale reservoirs will be built.
    In the desert of Turkmenistan, the construction project of the Great Turkmen Canal will be completed in five years. Its length is 1,100 kilometers, and there are no such canals anywhere in the world. This canal will irrigate 1.3 million hectares of desert area.
    A huge reservoir will also be built near Kakhovka on the Dnieper River. The water of the Dnieper River will flow to North Crimea and irrigate its fertile but water-deficient plains.
    Our people are implementing Stalin's plan to transform nature, reclaiming 28 million hectares of newly irrigated and newly watered land from deserts and arid grasslands. This area is larger than the entire area of the United Kingdom and more than twice the area of irrigated and watered land in the United States.
    The Volga-Don Canal, which will be open to navigation this year, connects all five seas in the European part of the Soviet Union into one transportation system. On May 31, when we were touring the famous sites of the Chinese capital and preparing for the conference (Note: referring to the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing on June 3), the waters of the two Russian rivers—the glorious Volga River and the quiet Don River—met. The Soviet people have achieved a remarkable new victory.
    As a result of the implementation of these huge constructions, our country can produce an additional 3 million tons of cotton, 500 million poods of wheat, 30 million poods of rice, and 6 million tons of sugar beets each year. The number of large horned livestock in these areas will expand by 2 million head, and sheep will increase by 9 million. All the huge constructions can be completed in six or seven years.
    The enemies of peace often slander the Soviet Union, attempting to distort the peaceful nature of our labor and thereby justifying their own country's frenzied arms expansion aimed at preparing for a new world war. The remarks of the American and British warmongers belong to this kind of slander.
    Regarding the slander of the former British Prime Minister Attlee, Comrade Stalin said the following:
    "If Prime Minister Attlee had read through the principles of finance and economics, then he would not find it difficult to understand: no country, including the Soviet Union, can fully develop its civil industry, while carrying out the great construction projects of the Volga River, Dnieper River, and Amu Darya hydroelectric power stations, which require hundreds of billions of budget expenditures, while continuing to implement the policy of planned reduction of consumer goods prices, which also requires hundreds of billions of budget expenditures, and while investing hundreds of billions to restore the national economy destroyed by the German occupation forces; and also increase the army and expand military industry at the same time. It is not difficult to understand that this reckless policy will lead to the collapse of the country."
    As is well known, we Soviet people, like the people of all countries, love our country, so they not only do not want to see the country collapse, but on the contrary, for the further prosperity of the motherland, they are personally concerned with defending world peace.
    This is why I, a representative of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee, fully support the proposal of the representatives of glorious and free China.
    The Soviet representatives and everyone else voted together to support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing this year to discuss an extremely important issue—the issue of defending peace.
    I appeal to all scientists in the Asian and Pacific region!
    Gentlemen! Friends!
    Let us strengthen our strength and will in the struggle to make reason triumph over madness, truth triumph over lies, and stop the dark forces of war that are against the spirit of all things!

    我们有组织地来保卫和平事业！
    苏联拥护和平委员会委员苏联科学院主席团科学秘书  伊凡·格鲁森科
    各国的意志善良的数以百万计的人们，在今天都团结在和平的旗帜下，在新战争纵火者的道路上组织成一个不可征服的障碍。不准战争，粉碎美国、英国和其他贩卖人类生命的商人的阴谋，这就是团结起来的数亿人们的目的。
    苏联人民一贯进行着争取和平与争取各民族友谊的斗争，为时已三十五年了。争取持久和平的斗争，是出自苏维埃国家的本性的，在这个国家里，没有企图从战争中致富的阶级。
    斯大林的和平政策是非常明确的。它不仅表现在苏联代表在各种国际会议上和在联合国大会上的声明里，而且它也表现在苏联人民及其政府的事业里。
    举几个例子吧。一九五一年春季，苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议通过了保卫和平法，根据这项法律，宣传战争要受到严重的刑事处分。
    一亿一千七百万以上的苏联公民，也就是说，全国十六岁以上的居民，都在世界和平理事会关于要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。
    一九五一年十一月，召开了第三届全苏拥护和平大会，这个会议是我国人民坚定不移地为和平而斗争的愿望的新明证。
    一九五二年五月九日——十二日，由于莫斯科和全俄罗斯大主教的发起，召开了苏联各教会和宗教团体和平大会，这个会议完全拥护世界和平理事会关于谴责侵略、禁止挑拨各民族间的敌视与仇恨的宣传的建议。
    苏联科学家——自己前辈的最优秀的传统的继承者，和工人、农民、作家、教师、工程师、牧师以及千千万万的人民一起，过去和现在都一致地拥护和平。
    罗曼诺索夫，洛巴柴夫斯基，谢切诺夫，巴甫洛夫，门德雷叶夫，季米良捷夫，米丘林和其他许多俄国科学家，都曾把自己的全部活动奉献给人类的幸福。他们是那一切阻挡人类走向自由与发展道路的热烈的憎恨者。全世界生物学家之首，著名的科学院士巴甫洛夫，在第十五届国际生理学者会议上曾说过这样极好的话：“无须辩驳：战争是解决生活困难的野蛮方法，这个方法不能与人类的智慧及其无尽的富源相称。”
    俄国科学界巨匠的这些光荣的传统，在苏联科学家的活动中被神圣地遵守着，而且继续发扬着。苏联生物学家，生理学家，医学家，地质学家，数学家，物理学家，工程师，人文学者，在改善生活条件中，在揭露服务人类的大自然的伟大秘密中，为了人类的生活看到了自己研究科学的意义。
    在资本主义国家里，战争贩子准备使用，而且已经使用了物理学家，生物学家，化学家的成就来屠杀和奴役人类。一部分为战争贩子收买了的科学家，今天正在争论着什么是消灭人类更有效的工具：原子弹还是细菌。加拿大细菌武器实验室之一的领导者在“标准”杂志上曾宣称：“大量歼灭人类的远景是非常乐观的……我们能够预料到将会获得最大的效果”。不久以前，美国科学家福列斯塔得曾坦白地道出他的意见说，在科学界“如果除去用于进一步发展破坏工具以外而消费在其他任何事情之上，那么每一分钱都是白白浪费了”。
    美国战争贩子及其御用学者们甚至企图用早已破产了的“理论”来为准备新屠杀找论据。现在，憎恨人类的马尔萨斯的和种族主义者的“理论”在广泛地宣传着。
    我自己是个生物学家。因此，我所谈的也只限于这个现在作为思想斗争工具和技术斗争工具的被广泛使用着的这门科学。
    我现在举出一些事实。不久以前，在纽约出版了
    一本威廉·范格特所著的臭名远扬的假科学的书
    “拯救之路”。这本书在美国曾引起很大的注意，而且当作最好的范本来推荐给读者。这本书在英国也大吹大擂地宣传着，同时再版着。因为坚持介绍该书而引起全世界政客们注意的美国有名的战争贩子巴鲁区，为这本书作了序言。为作者所鼓吹的这本“拯救之路”，决不是什么新奇事物。它是很早以前就被从种族主义武库中选出的思想所“丰富”了的、为真正的科学所摈弃了的马尔萨斯的“理论”。
    如果说，马尔萨斯是宣传了减缩生殖率，那么，范格特就更进了一步：他不仅要求停止地球上居民的增殖，而且还要减缩人类现有的数目。例如，他把医学说成有害的事情，因为它会减低劳动人民的死亡率。他把瘟疫、灾荒、饥饿和战争认为是人类的幸福。他完全赞成法西斯的发明——消除生殖性能，而且无耻地把这种“发明”加以广泛介绍，但是，当然，是向贫困的居民阶层来介绍。
    这本书中的一些摘录，在我看来，对于了解“民主”的美国的所谓学者们的残忍达到何种程度，是有用处的。
    范格特惋惜卫生工作人员们曾以各种方法向疾病进行斗争帮助减低了拉丁美洲人口的死亡率，而在以前，这些病患正是限制人口增加的最有效的方法。
    对于造成印度人民艰苦的经济状态的原因，范格特并不认为是数十年来英国殖民者对印度人民实行殖民地式的横蛮剥削的结果，他把这种原因归诸：
    “印度人依照他们的习惯，以鱼一般不负责任的态度繁殖起来。”
    在评述了世界各个不同地区的人口状况以后，范格特也没有忘掉欧洲，他说：“先求得稳定，然后再减少欧洲人口的数字，这对于普遍的和平与繁荣将会是最大的贡献。”
    他的所谓能够“拯救人类”的“拯救方法”究竟是什么呢？
    范格特所推荐的主要的“实际”的建议就是：
    “以不多的、但却是足够的金钱给予所有同意施行以减低生殖能力为目的的简单手术的人，特别是男人。”以种族主义的说教为出发点，范格特认为：
    “从社会利益的观点看，经常把钱付给那些很多在体力和智力上都低劣的穷人，要比帮助他们的大量子女好得多。这些后代，由于受了生理的和社会的遗传性的限制，对于生活将会一无用处。”
    这就是腐朽的资本主义社会制度中生物科学的精神衰惫症，这就是他们的思想的破产！
    各国的进步科学家们，正在痛斥科学叛徒们的这类“科学研究”，是无须多谈了。
    在和平阵营中，各资本主义国家的进步科学家们，正在与苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的学者们肩并肩地站在最前列进行斗争。
    在国际和平运动的最伟大的活动家之中，我们可以举出现代最卓越的物理学家之一，约里奥——居里，中国科学院院长郭沫若，著名女物理学家戈登夫人，印度的高善必教授，英国的贝尔纳教授，美国的莫理逊，比利时的柯任斯，日本的大山郁夫以及其他等等。
    我们经常可以从资产阶级的报纸上听到和读到这样的话：苏联已用铁幕把它的科学工作者与世界其他部分相隔绝，世界已被分裂为东方和西方。世界确实在实际上已被分裂，但它并不是被分为“东方”和“西方”，而是被分为和平的拥护者和反对者两方面。生活证明，在任何一个资本主义国家中，除掉范格特之类的蒙昧主义者外，也还有先进的和平的劳动者在工作，他们正在忠诚而真实地为人类的幸福服务。
    苏联的学者和各人民民主国家的科学家、资本主义各国的进步学者们之间的联系，正在逐年地增长和巩固。
    在苏联曾举行过一系列的国际科学工作者代表大会——如国际土壤学者第二届会议，国际生理学者第十五届会议，国际地理学者第十七届会议。苏联的植物学者们并曾于一九五○年参加了在斯德哥尔摩举行的第七届国际植物学者会议。
    我们的科学院自一七六九年起即与伦敦的皇家协会交换出版物，与巴黎科学院交换出版物是由一八四一年开始。目前我国科学院在国际书籍交换方面，每月经由自己的图书馆寄给世界五十六个国家中一千五百个以上科学机关的科学书籍和杂志就达
    一万三千册左右。但是英美侵略集团各国的政府却在明显地推行着限制交换科学书籍的政策。在一九五一年中，美国国务院曾禁止向苏联和各人民民主国家出口技术和自然科学的书籍。
    但是这类办法并没有能中止各个国家中进步的科学家和文化活动家们彼此间友谊联系的增长。
    我们以特别的同情向这些进步的科学和文化工作者和全体爱好和平的人民伸出友谊、敬重和相互了解的手。
    为什么苏联人要这样热情而坚持地保卫和平事业呢？他们是害怕吗？不，决不是。由法西斯希特勒匪徒们所发动的最近的一次流血战争，已向全世界证明了苏联人民是拥有鹰的威力和钢铁的堡垒的。
    苏联人的拥护和平，是为了不愿使人类在许多世纪中所创造的文化遭受炮火和毁灭，不愿让父亲们残废和死亡，不愿让母亲们痛苦，不愿让孩子们失掉父母和无家可归。
    希特勒匪帮的血污的罪行的痕迹，在苏联人的心中记忆犹新。
    德国法西斯掠夺者曾使苏联受到巨大的损害。他们曾全部或局部地毁坏和焚烧了一千七百一十个市镇和七万所以上的村落，捣毁了三万一千八百五十个工业企业，六万五千公里长的铁轨，掠夺和毁坏了九万八千所集体农场，一千八百七十六个国家农场和二千八百九十个机器拖拉机站。
    有人说，数字是不容易记忆的，但苏联人对它们却记得很清楚。我相信，那些真心地不愿看到新的流血、新的数百万人的牺牲的人们，将一直会牢牢地记住这些数字的。
    全世界的人都知道，苏联人在战后治愈了他们的创伤，正在用自己的劳动的手创造着划时代的建设。
    全体苏联人民以对于自己伟大的祖国的最骄傲的感情，来迎接苏联政府关于在伏尔加河建筑古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水力发电站、南乌克兰和北克里米亚灌溉运河和卡霍夫卡水力发电站、以及伏尔加—顿运河通航运河及齐姆良水电站一些富有历史意义的决议。苏联政府的这些决议，同时解决了三个问题：灌溉的、动力的和运输的问题。
    在伏尔加河，在古比雪夫和斯大林格勒城区，将建筑世界上两个最大的水力发电站和两个大规模的水库。
    在土库曼的沙漠上，五年以后将完成土库曼大运河的建筑工程。其长度为一千一百公里，世界各地都没有这样的运河。这条运河将灌溉一百三十万公顷沙漠地带。
    在第聂泊河上卡霍夫卡附近，也要建筑一个巨大的水库。第聂泊河的水将流向北克里米亚并灌溉其肥沃的但缺水的平原。
    我国人民实现着斯大林的改造自然计划，正在从沙漠和干旱的草原中开垦着二千八百万公顷新灌溉的和新供水的土地。这个面积比英国全国面积还要大，同时超过美国灌溉和供水田地的二倍。
    今年已经能开始通航的伏尔加—顿运河，把苏联欧洲部分的全部五个海连接成一个运输系统。五月三十一日，当我们观光中国首都的名胜并准备会议（按：指六月三日在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议）的那一天，两条俄国的河流——光荣的伏尔加河和静静的顿河——的水会合了。苏联人获得了卓越的新胜利。
    这些巨大建筑的实现结果，我国能每年多生产三百万吨棉花、五亿普特小麦、三千万普特大米和六百万吨甜菜。大角牲畜在这些地区的头数将扩大二百万头，羊则增加九百万只。六七年后，全部巨大建筑即可完成。
    和平的敌人时常诽谤苏联，企图歪曲我们劳动的和平性质，并以此为其本国旨在准备新世界战争的疯狂的军备扩张辩护。美英战争贩子的言论，即是属于这种诽谤性的。
    关于英国前任首相艾德礼的诽谤，斯大林同志曾说过以下的话：
    “假如艾德礼首相读通了财政经济学的话，那末他就不难了解：没有一个国家，包括苏联在内，能够在尽力发展民用工业的时候，在进行需要数百亿预算支出的伏尔加河、第聂伯河、阿姆·达里亚河水力发电站之类的伟大建设工程的时候，在继续推行同样需要数百亿预算支出的有计划地减低消费品价格的政策的时候，并且在投资数千亿以恢复德国占领军所破坏的国民经济的时候；还能同时增加军队，扩大军事工业。不难了解，这种胡作非为的政策必将招致国家的崩溃。”
    如所周知，我们苏联人也和各国人民一样，是爱自己的国家的，因此他们不仅不愿意使国家遭到崩溃，而相反地，为了祖国进一步的繁荣，是与保卫世界和平有切身利害关系的。
    这就是我，一个苏联拥护和平委员会的代表，完全拥护光荣和自由的中国的代表们的建议的原因。
    苏联代表们和大家一齐投票拥护今年在北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，以讨论一项异常重要的问题——保卫和平问题。
    我向亚洲和太平洋区域各国的全体科学家们呼吁！
    先生们！朋友们！
    让我们在争取使理智战胜疯狂、真理战胜谎言、制止那反对万物之灵的人的黑暗的战争势力的斗争中，来加强我们的力量和意志！
