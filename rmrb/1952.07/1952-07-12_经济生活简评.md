Brief Commentary on Economic Life

Promoting the Experience of Wheat Close Planting

The Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko once said: "Chinese agricultural technicians should create a new set of Chinese agricultural techniques." The Shuangqiao Experimental Farm changed China's traditional method of sparse wheat planting with "wide rows and large ridges, ventilation and light transmission." They learned from advanced Soviet experience and implemented methods such as shortening row spacing and close planting, which greatly increased the yield per unit area of wheat. This year, the yield of close-planted wheat on the farm was doubled compared to sparsely planted wheat. This powerfully demonstrates that promoting advanced Soviet experience in agricultural production and combining it with China's actual conditions to create a set of cultivation techniques suitable for China's new agricultural production is of great significance for increasing agricultural production and further laying the foundation for national industrialization.

The fact that the Shuangqiao Experimental Farm achieved high yields by implementing close wheat planting shows that agricultural scientists must closely integrate theory with practice, humbly learn from advanced Soviet experience, break with traditional conservative thinking, boldly and carefully conduct scientific experiments, and implement reforms in agricultural production technology. This is the glorious task that all state-owned farms, agricultural scientific institutions, and agricultural production leaders should undertake. As long as we strive to create new production technologies and do a good job in promotion, we have full assurance of greatly increasing the yield per unit area of all agricultural products.

We request that all localities pay attention to studying and, to the extent possible, appropriately promote the experience of close wheat planting created by the Shuangqiao Experimental Farm. This experience should first be promoted in all state-owned farms.

Don't Relax Drought Prevention Work Just Because It Rains for Two Days

Readers Shan Dongchu, Zhou Chuanbiao, and Liu Xianhui wrote to reflect a noteworthy situation: On June 17, the Tenth District of Hengyang County, Hunan Province, held a meeting of district and township cadres to discuss drought resistance and prevention. Before the meeting and at the beginning of the meeting, the drought was very serious, and at least 2,000 acres of land in the district were threatened by drought; therefore, everyone was very anxious. While the meeting was in progress, it rained heavily for two days. Some township cadres at the meeting said: "It doesn't matter, the problem is solved, there is no need to continue the meeting." Some district cadres also said: "These days of meetings discussing drought prevention and resistance are a waste." Seeing that it had rained for two days, they forgot all about the threat of drought. How can this be?

Such things do not only happen in the Tenth District of Hengyang County. Such thinking is not only held by some cadres in the Tenth District of Hengyang County. In some places, there is not a great lack of rainfall in the spring, so the masses do not pay attention to drought prevention, and the cadres also think that there is no need to bother too much. Later, when it doesn't rain for a few days, they shout "there's no way," "it's terrible," and after it rains once or twice, they feel that everything is fine. They do not have constant vigilance and full preparation for drought, they do not have a comprehensive plan and meticulous plans for drought prevention, they ignore the future after the present, only care about the present and do not think about the future; they are lazy for a while, causing great difficulties later.

It is certainly possible that the weather will be good throughout the year. It is also possible that drought will occur. Moreover, this possibility is not very small. Even if the possibility is very small, we should, with a high degree of responsibility to the people, prepare for the worst. To truly guarantee the results of increased production, we must start from the worst situation and not have any侥幸 psychology. "Preparedness averts peril" is indeed a golden saying. We should establish the idea of long-term drought prevention and lay the foundation for long-term drought prevention with practical actions.

    经济生活简评
    推广小麦密植的经验
    苏联农业专家卢森科曾说：“中国的农业技术人员，应该创造一套新的中国的农业技术。”双桥实习农场改变了我国传统的“宽行大垅，通风通光”的小麦稀植法，他们学习了苏联先进经验，实行了缩短行距，实行密植的办法，就使小麦的单位面积产量大大提高。该场今年密植小麦的产量比稀植小麦的产量提高了一倍。这就有力地说明了在农业生产上推广苏联先进经验，并使苏联先进经验和我国的实际情况相结合，创造出一套适合新中国农业生产需要的耕作技术，这对于我国农业增产以及进一步为国家工业化打下基础，是有着重大意义的。
    双桥实习农场实行小麦密植获得高额产量这一事实说明：农业科学工作者必须把理论与实际密切结合，虚心学习苏联先进经验，打破传统的保守思想，大胆而细心地进行科学试验，实行农业生产技术的改革，这是一切国营农场、农业科学机关和农业生产领导工作人员应当担负起来的光荣任务。只要我们努力创造新的生产技术，并作好推广工作，我们便有着充分的保证，在一切农产物中大大地提高单位面积产量。
    我们要求各地注意研究并在可能范围内适当推广双桥实习农场创造的小麦密植的经验。这一经验应首先在各国营农场中推广起来。
    不要因下两天雨就放松防旱工作
    读者单冬初、周传彪、刘贤惠来信反映了一个值得注意的情况：六月十七日，湖南省衡阳县第十区召开区乡干部会议，讨论抗旱防旱问题。开会以前和会议之初，旱象很严重，全区至少有二千多亩田受着旱灾的威胁；因此，大家非常着急。正在开会时，连下了两天大雨。正在开会的乡干部就说：“不要紧了，问题解决了，不必开会了。”有些区干部也说：“这几天的会讨论防旱抗旱是白费了。”看见下了两天雨，便把旱灾的威胁，忘得无影无踪了。这怎么可以呢？
    这样的事情不只发生在衡阳县第十区。这样的思想也不只是衡阳县第十区的某些干部才有。有些地方春季雨水不太缺少，群众就不注意防旱，干部也认为不必多麻烦。后来几天不下雨，就叫喊“没办法”，“不得了”，下了一两次雨，又觉得是万事大吉了。他们对于旱灾没有经常的警惕和充分的准备，对于防旱没有通盘的方针和周密的计划，过了前段不顾后段，只顾现在不想将来；一时偷懒偷闲，造成后来很大的困难。
    全年风调雨顺，当然是有可能的。发生旱灾，同样也是有可能的。而且，这种可能性还不是很小的。即使可能性很小，我们也应该以高度对人民负责的态度，防备于万一。要确实保证取得增产胜利的成果，就要从最坏的情况出发，不能有半点侥幸心理。“有备无患”，确是至理名言。我们应当树立长期防旱的思想，并用实际行动，打下长期防旱的基础。
