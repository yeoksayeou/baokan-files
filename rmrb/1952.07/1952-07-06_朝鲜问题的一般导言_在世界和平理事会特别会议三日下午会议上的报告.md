    General Introduction to the Korean Question
    ——Report at the Afternoon Session of the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council on July 3rd
    Guo Moruo
    Regarding the Korean question, our respected Chairman Joliot-Curie has already mentioned it in his report, and he spoke very concisely. I will now simply add some general opinions.
    The Korean War reached its second anniversary on June 25th.
    The military forces of both sides are stalemated near the 38th parallel, where the war began. The armistice negotiations, which began on July 10th last year, will soon reach their first anniversary.
    During these lengthy negotiations, the American side has put forward various unreasonable demands and created various provocative incidents, making each agenda item of the negotiations extremely complex and difficult. In order to comply with the peace aspirations of the people of the world, the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have consistently responded calmly and with extreme patience.
    Only one issue remains unresolved in the armistice negotiations, which is why they are still being delayed. This issue is the repatriation of prisoners of war. Negotiations on this issue began on December 11th last year, and it has been delayed for seven months without a resolution.
    In fact, this is a non-issue. According to historical practice, especially the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, after the cessation of hostilities, both sides should immediately repatriate prisoners of war. Prisoners of war cannot waive their right to be repatriated home to live a peaceful life. However, the American side is unwilling to abide by this convention and wants to detain more than 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, refusing to repatriate them. Therefore, the negotiations are still being delayed.
    On this issue, we can clearly see the intentions of the American government.
    The U.S. representatives at the negotiating table have done everything possible to delay the negotiations, creating pretexts that violate the Geneva Convention, such as "one-for-one exchange," "voluntary repatriation," and "political asylum," in order to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.
    At the Panmunjom meeting, they repeatedly stated that their proposal was "firm, final, and unchangeable," while whistling, pretending to sleep, leaving the meeting without authorization, or even unilaterally announcing a three-day adjournment during the negotiations.
    In the past few months, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese people have made a series of concessions in order to quickly resolve the prisoner of war issue on a reasonable basis. I can cite two suggestions as proof:
    On February 3rd, it was suggested that the commanders of both sides guarantee that their captured personnel would not participate in the Korean War after repatriation, so that they could return home to live a peaceful life. This was to alleviate the American side's concerns that the repatriation of prisoners of war would increase the military strength of the other side. This suggestion was accepted by the American side.
    On March 27th, it was suggested that both sides be divided into three categories according to nationality and place of residence. First, foreign armed personnel (United Nations forces and Chinese People's Volunteer Army) should all be repatriated home; second, Korean armed personnel (South Korean army and Korean People's Army) whose homes are in the other side's territory should all be repatriated; third, those whose homes are in the receiving area may be allowed to return home on the spot. However, the U.S. side insisted on so-called "voluntary repatriation" and implemented the screening of prisoners of war, using armed pressure and mass slaughter.
    The U.S. side's attitude of attempting to delay the negotiations at the armistice talks is undisguised, and the provocative actions attempting to undermine the negotiations outside the talks are even more undisguised.
    First of all, I must mention the large-scale use of bacteriological weapons during the negotiations. According to the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war Quinn and Enoch, who personally dropped bacteriological bombs, the American army began using bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield on January 1st of this year. The use of this weapon has not stopped until now.
    Secondly, there was the large-scale massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. In order to support its principle of voluntary repatriation, the American side forced Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to express that they were not volunteering voluntarily. The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war did not agree, so the American side created continuous tragedies of mass slaughtering prisoners of war with various murderous weapons. Part of the truth of this tragedy has been admitted by General Colson, the former head of the prisoner of war camp. General Colson was also dismissed as a result. However, after General Colson was dismissed, the situation worsened.
    Thirdly, the American army has recently taken an adventurous action, which is to blow up the peaceful hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River.
    The Korean situation is one of the most pressing issues of greatest concern to the people of the world.
    Mad war provocateurs are eager to expand the war.
    We make an urgent appeal to the people of the world, asking to achieve the following goals:
    1. Immediately stop the use of bacteriological weapons, and ask the people of all countries to require their governments to approve and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, which prohibits the use of bacteriological weapons.
    2. Immediately stop the mass slaughter of peaceful residents and the wanton destruction of peaceful cities and peaceful construction.
    3. Immediately stop the acts of torturing prisoners of war in violation of international law.
    4. Immediately complete the armistice agreement and unconditionally and quickly repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.
    5. After an agreement is reached on the armistice negotiations, resolve the Korean issue on fair and reasonable terms.
    There are two ancient poems in China that almost everyone knows:
    Wildfire
    Burns the grass but not the roots;
    The spring breeze blows
    And the earth is green again.
    In the two years of the Korean War, we have seen this green truth again beside unprecedented disasters—the people who have become masters can never be conquered.
    The mad fire-players do not see this truth, and they always think that the fire is not burning thoroughly enough.
    The people of the world should unite to stop this serious danger of war, especially the American people should have the moral responsibility to save the people of the world from unimaginable cruel disasters.
    Scientists, especially American scientists, have a moral responsibility to make science always serve life and rescue it from the degradation of becoming a tool for mass slaughter of mankind.
    Now is the return of the era of Bruno and Galileo.
    We must defend science, defend humanity, and defend peace!

### 朝鲜问题的一般导言——在世界和平理事会特别会议三日下午会议上的报告

    朝鲜问题的一般导言
    ——在世界和平理事会特别会议三日下午会议上的报告
    郭沫若
    关于朝鲜问题，在我所敬爱的约里奥—居里主席的报告中已经提到，说得非常扼要。我现在只简单地补充些一般的意见。
    朝鲜战争在六月二十五日已经满两周年了。
    双方军事力量在开始发动战争的三八线附近相持着。自去年七月十日停战谈判开始以来，很快也要满一周年了。
    在这漫长的谈判期间，美国方面提出了种种不合理的要求，制造了种种挑衅事件，使谈判的每一个议程都陷于非常复杂和困难的境地。为了符合全世界人民的和平愿望，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表一直是以极忍耐的态度沉着应付的。
    停战谈判就只剩下一个问题还没有得到协议，因而还被拖延着。这个问题就是遣返战俘的问题。这是从去年十二月十一日开始谈判的，为了这一个问题，竟拖延了七个月，一直还没有得到解决。
    其实这是不成问题的一个问题。根据历史的惯例，尤其是一九四九年的日内瓦战俘公约的规定，交战双方停止战争之后，便立即遣返俘虏，战俘不能放弃被遣返回家过和平生活的权利。但美国方面却不愿意遵守这项公约，要扣留十万人以上的朝中战俘，不肯遣返。因此谈判还被拖延着。
    在这个问题上，我们可以很明显地看出美国政府的企图。
    美方代表在谈判会议席上，极尽了拖延谈判的能事，制造出违反日内瓦公约的藉口，如“一对一交换”，如“自愿遣返”，如“政治避难”等等，来扣留朝中被俘人员。
    他们在板门店会场上，一味重复地说他们的方案是“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”，而在谈判进行时吹口哨、装睡觉、擅自离席甚至动辄片面宣布休会三天。
    朝中人民的代表在过去几个月间，为了在合理的基础上迅速解决这一战俘问题，曾经做了一系列的让步，我可以举出两项建议为证：
    二月三日建议由双方司令官保证其被俘人员在遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争，以便回家过和平生活。这是为了解除美国方面的顾虑，以为战俘遣返会增加对方的军事力量。这一建议为美国方面所接受了。
    三月二十七日建议双方按国籍及居家地区分为三类。第一，外国武装人员（联合国军及中国人民志愿军）应全部遣返回家；第二，朝鲜武装人员（南朝鲜军及朝鲜人民军）其家在对方地区者应全部遣返；第三，其家在收容地区者得许就地回家。而美方坚持所谓“自愿遣返”，并实行甄别战俘，使用武装压力和大批屠杀的方法。
    美方在停战谈判会场上企图拖延谈判的态度是无可掩饰的，而在谈判会场外企图破坏谈判的挑衅行为，更是无可掩饰的。
    首先我要举出的便是谈判进行中细菌武器的大规模使用。根据亲自投掷过细菌弹的美国空军战俘奎恩与伊纳克的供认，美国军队在朝鲜战场上开始使用细菌武器是本年一月一日。这种武器的使用一直到现在还没有停止。
    其次是在巨济岛上大规模虐杀朝中战俘。美国方面为了要支持它的自愿遣返的原则，强迫朝中战俘表示不是自己志愿的志愿，朝中被俘人员不同意，于是美国方面便造成连续不断地用种种杀人武器大量屠杀战俘的惨剧。这惨剧真相的一部分，已由前俘虏营负责者柯尔生将军自行承认。柯尔生将军也因而被撤职。但在柯尔生将军被撤职之后，情况却更加恶化了。
    再其次美国军队最近又采取了一种冒险的行为，便是把鸭绿江上的和平设备水力发电厂炸坏了。
    朝鲜的局势所引起的是全世界人民所最关注的最迫切的问题之一。
    疯狂的战争挑衅者急于想扩大战争。
    我们向全世界人民作迫切的呼吁，要求达到这样的目的：
    一、立即停止细菌武器的使用，并请各国人民要求自己的政府一律批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。
    二、立即停止对和平居民的大量屠杀，对和平城市与和平的建设的肆意毁坏。
    三、立即停止违反国际公法的虐杀战俘的行为。
    四、立即完成停战谈判的协议并遵照一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约双方无条件地迅速遣返战俘。
    五、在停战谈判获得协议之后，在公平合理的条件之上解决朝鲜问题。
    有两句古诗在中国差不多是人人都知道的：
    野火
    把草烧不断根；
    春风一吹
    大地又一片绿色。
    在两年的朝鲜战争中，我们在史无先例的灾难旁边。又一次看到了这个绿色的真实——作了主人的人民是永远不能被征服的。
    疯狂的玩火者看不到这个真实，他总以为火还烧得不够彻底。
    全世界人民应该一致起来制止这一严重的战争危险，特别是美国人民应有道义上的责任，使全世界人民免于不可想像的残酷的灾祸。
    科学家们尤其美国的科学家们应有道义上的责任，要使科学永远为人生服务，把它从成为大量屠杀人类的工具的堕落中救起。
    现在是布鲁诺和伽利略的时代的再来。
    我们要保卫科学、保卫人类、保卫和平！
