    The Slogan of "Correctly Using Specialized Technical Personnel" Cannot Be Distorted

    To the Editor: Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Put Specialized Technical Personnel in the Posts Most Needed for Economic Construction," many technical personnel have been greatly encouraged. This sentiment, mainly based on doing a good job in the motherland's economic construction, is correct and should be. However, some cadres have shown erroneous attitudes. For example, a cadre from our Dantu County branch of the People's Bank of China, who used to work in the post office for more than ten years, was transferred to the bank after liberation. He has said more than once, "The salary at the bank is half of what it was at the post office." Recently, upon hearing about "specialized technical personnel returning to their units," he jumped up and said, "Now I don't have to worry about being labeled as not working with peace of mind. I also want to return to my unit." Comrades unanimously pointed out that he was not engaged in any specialized technical work in the past; he was only pursuing higher pay based on his personal economic interests. There are also some people who look for excuses for their personal interests. For example, some people have worked as teachers, bookstore editors, and administrative staff in government organs. Among these, he feels that being an editor "suits his taste the most," so he claims to be a "specialized editor" and requests a job transfer. Another example is someone who has worked in a cultural troupe and claims to be a "specialized literary talent." In fact, they have all distorted the basic meaning of the People's Daily editorial.

    For the needs of the motherland's construction cause, and in order to truly put specialized technical personnel in the posts most needed for economic construction, ideas like the above, which stem from personal selfish motives, should be promptly criticized.

    不能曲解“正确使用专门技术人材”的口号
    编辑同志：自从人民日报发表“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论以后，不少技术人员欢欣鼓舞。这种情绪主要是建筑在搞好祖国经济建设的基础上，是正确的、应该的。但有一部分干部表现了错误的态度。如我们中国人民银行丹徒县支行的一个干部，他过去在邮局工作过十多年，解放后调到银行来工作。他不只一次地说：“银行待遇比邮局低一半。”最近，听到了“专门技术人材归队”的话，便跳起来说：“这下子不怕戴不安心工作的帽子了。我也要归队。”同志们一致指出，他过去搞的不是什么专门技术工作，他只是从个人的经济利益出发，追求较高的待遇。还有一种人，则为个人的兴趣找藉口。如有人曾经做过教员、书局编辑、机关行政工作等，其中他觉得做编辑“最合口味”，他就说自己是“编辑专门人材”，要求调动工作。又如有人在文工团工作过，就说自己是“文艺专门人材”。其实他们都歪曲了人民日报社论的基本意思。
    为了祖国建设事业的需要，为了真正把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去，类似上述这样从个人自私的目的出发的思想，应当及时地加以批判。    雁序
