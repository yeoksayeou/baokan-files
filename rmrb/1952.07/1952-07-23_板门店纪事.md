    A Chronicle of Panmunjom
    Tian Jian
    V. The Story of the Apple
    Once again, I visited Panmunjom, and a military police officer at Panmunjom told me the story of the apple; the names of the characters in the story have been lost, but the facts are absolutely true.
    Last August, after the failure of the American devils' autumn offensive, they had no choice but to come to Panmunjom and sit in tents to continue the armistice negotiations. When they first arrived at Panmunjom, the local people pointed at them and said:
    "These are merchants in military uniforms!"
    The villagers also said they were:
    "Some madmen!"
    These madmen sat in Jeeps, holding wine bottles in their hands, drinking wine in the car, showing how powerful and wealthy they were.
    In the Jeeps they sat in, they also brought a lot of candy and apples to give away, scattering candy and apples to the children by the roadside while driving. The enemy, the schemers, had a wonderful idea, inserting a few flowers into their war robes, and pasting the words "charity" on their bayonets, thinking that the people would regard the robbers as philanthropists, and accept the gifts made of blood by the robbers. Little did they know that the people are not blind, and the people know what a real gift is.
    On the highway, by a rice paddy, a Jeep stopped, and an American officer got out of the car, holding an apple in his hand, and walked up to a Korean child. With a hypocritical face, he asked:
    "What's your name?"
    This Korean child, holding a bouquet of flowers in his hand, this bouquet of flowers, he wanted to give to our negotiation representatives. At this time, he answered the American, answering very simply:
    "I won't tell you."
    The American officer was still smiling, reaching out to see the flowers in the child's hand:
    "Is this for me?"
    The child was wary and put the flowers behind his back, afraid that the American officer would snatch them. The child answered him:
    "I won't give it to you. I want to give it to our negotiation representatives."
    The American officer wanted someone to give him a bouquet of flowers on the highway in Panmunjom, so he could take it to the tent and brag a bit. He also wanted to test the child, saying:
    "Give it to me, and I'll give you an apple."
    At this time, the child's eyes stared at the hateful, shameless guy, without saying a word. He hadn't thought of what to say yet. But soon he spoke:
    "This is a Korean apple, not yours."
    The American officer endured his anger and said:
    "Yes, I brought it from America."
    This Korean child also stubbornly said:
    "No, you stole the Korean apples."
    The American officer couldn't bear it anymore, and was about to think of a way to retaliate, when a group of children suddenly rushed up, surrounded the Jeep, shouting. The American devils in the car thought they all wanted to eat apples, and scattered apples down to the children. Little did they know that the children picked up the apples and threw them at the Jeep, hitting them in the face.
    The children answered them:
    "We don't eat the apples you stole. You go back to America!"
    The car also scattered candy down. The children still picked up the candy and threw it back at the car, hitting the American officer in the face. The children answered them:
    "We don't eat the candy you stole. You go back to America!"
    Then there was a shout:
    "American devils get out of Korea!"
    "American devils get out of Korea!"
    The Jeep drove away. The American officer in the car, holding a wine bottle, drank wine, and sneered. Let the robbers sneer. Children are innocent lawyers, they can ruthlessly tear off the robbers' faces.
    The people know that the value of peace, the value of freedom, is much greater than the value of candy! The people are the manufacturers of apples and the manufacturers of sugar. The invaders robbed the fruits of the people's labor, and then scattered the stolen goods to the people, wanting the people to admit that the robbers are benefactors, and shout "thank you" in front of the robbers. This is a daydream. Look, the brave children tore off their faces and hung them in Panmunjom. (End of full text)

    板门店纪事
    田间
    五、苹果的故事
    有一次我再来访问板门店，板门店的一位军事警察，和我讲这苹果的故事；故事中人物的姓名，已经失传，但事实一点不假。
    去年八月间，美国鬼子秋季攻势失败后，他们不得不到板门店来，坐在帐篷里继续停战谈判。他们刚一到板门店的时候，这儿的老乡，指着他们说：
    ——这是穿军服的商人！
    老乡们又说他们是：
    ——一些疯子！
    这一些疯子，坐在吉普车上，手里还拿着酒瓶，在车上喝着酒。表示他们很威风，而且阔气。
    在他们坐的吉普车上，还带来不少的糖和苹果，要施舍一下子，一面开着车，一面把糖和苹果撒给路旁的孩子们。敌人，阴谋家想的倒妙，在战袍上插上几朵花，在刺刀上贴上慈善两个字，以为人民就会把强盗当做慈善家，会接受强盗拿鲜血泡制的礼物。哪里知道：人民不是瞎子，人民懂得什么东西才叫礼物。
    在公路上，在一块稻田边，吉普车停住，一位美国军官从车上走下来，手上拿着一个苹果，走到一个朝鲜孩子的身边。脸上假惺惺地，问道：
    “你叫什么名字？”
    这位朝鲜孩子，他手上拿着一束鲜花，这一束鲜花，他要送给我们的谈判代表。这时他回答那美国人，回答得很干脆：
    “我不告诉你。”
    那美国军官还笑着，把手伸过来想要看看孩子手上的花：
    “这是送给我的？”
    孩子提防了一下，把花放到背后，怕那美国军官动手抢，孩子回答他说：
    “我不送给你。我要送给我们的谈判代表。”
    那美国军官很想有人在板门店的公路上，送他一束花，他好拿着带到帐篷里去吹一下牛，他还想试一试孩子，说：
    “送给我，我请你吃苹果。”
    这时，孩子的眼睛，盯着那个可恶的无耻的家伙，一句话也没有说。话还没有想好。可是很快他就说话了：
    “这是朝鲜的苹果，不是你们的。”
    那个美国军官忍着气说：
    “是，是我从美国带来的。”
    这朝鲜孩子也硬着嘴说：
    “不是，是你们把朝鲜的苹果抢走了。”
    那美国军官忍不住了，正要想法报复一下，有一群孩子一下涌上来，围着吉普车，嚷着。车上的美国鬼子以为他们都是要苹果吃的，把苹果往下撒，撒给孩子们。哪里知道，孩子们把苹果拾起，掷到吉普车上，对着他们的脸上打。
    孩子们回答他们：
    “我们不吃你们抢的苹果。你们快回美国去！”
    车上又把糖撒下来。孩子们照样又把糖拾起来，又掷到车上，掷到美国军官的脸上。孩子们回答他们：
    “我们不吃你们抢的糖。你们快回美国去！”
    接着是一片喊声：
    ——美国鬼子滚出朝鲜去！
    ——美国鬼子滚出朝鲜去！
    吉普车开跑了。美国军官在车上，拿着酒瓶喝着酒，冷笑着。让强盗们冷笑去吧。孩子是天真的律师，他们可以无情地撕破强盗的脸。
    人民知道，和平的价值，自由的价值，比糖果的价值大得多哩！人民是苹果的制造人，也是糖的制造人。侵略者抢下了人民劳动的果实，又把赃物撒给人民，想要人民承认强盗就是恩人，在强盗面前喊声“谢谢”，这是白日作梦。看吧，勇敢的孩子撕下了他们的脸，把它挂在板门店。（全文完）
