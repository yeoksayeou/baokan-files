To the Editor:

We believe that Fu Hongbin's suggestion in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on June 25, regarding the standardization of the style and dimensions of the "mortar spreader," is very good.

Regarding the standardization of the "mortar spreader," it is difficult to stipulate a uniform size because the specifications of bricks used across the country are currently inconsistent. We now provide an example of a "mortar spreader" made according to the specifications of Beijing bricks (250×120×60), hoping that comrades engaged in construction work in various regions will imitate and implement it according to local conditions.

When building a single-layer wall, the "mortar spreader" should be 25 cm wide, 40.5 cm long, and 32 cm high. It should resemble a bucket, open at the bottom, with two iron strips, 6 mm thick, 15 mm wide, and 480 mm long, nailed to the sides of the bottom of the "mortar spreader," riding on the wall. The ends of the iron strips should be raised, with a recess of about 1.5 cm to 2 cm on each side. One side has an iron piece resting against the outer wall surface, allowing the "mortar spreader" to be supported. The two ends of the "mortar spreader" have inclined mortar dispensing chutes, 1 cm away from the brick surface. The chutes have three or four notches, so the mortar thickness is exactly 1 cm, with three or four thicker strips of mortar for squeezing. This mortar dispensing plate can be freely flipped. If the mortar bed has uneven thickness, a pin can be inserted into another hole for adjustment.

In the middle of the bucket-shaped "mortar spreader" there is a hinged flap inclined at 45 degrees (or fixed in place). This allows the mortar to slide down the slope. With the hinged flap, when encountering doorways or the top of the wall, the flap can be flipped over to load some mortar and spread it in reverse, thus overcoming the shortcoming of not being able to spread mortar to the top of the wall in the past.

The "mortar spreader" should ride on the wall with iron strips so that the weight of the "mortar spreader" and the mortar is evenly distributed over several bricks, and to flatten uneven areas on the brick surface, preventing the up and down jumping that occurs when using "mortar spreaders" with wheels (i.e., small iron wheels) encountering brick seams.

The mortar outlet of the "mortar spreader" should be inclined, and the width of contact with the brick should be 6-10 cm, because a smaller contact area means less resistance, making it easier to push. When the mortar is placed in the bucket and not pushed, moisture will not be absorbed by the bricks, and the mortar will be dispensed evenly.

The "mortar spreader" uses a single-sided iron sheet to lean against one side of the wall, allowing it to spread mortar fully at the corners of the wall. When using it, the "mortar spreader" should be pressed against the wall by hand.

### 全国总工会建筑工会工委会  对傅鸿宾建议统一“铺灰器”的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    全国总工会建筑工会工委会
    对傅鸿宾建议统一“铺灰器”的答复
    编辑同志：六月二十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了傅鸿宾同志提出的对统一“铺灰器”的样式和尺寸的建议，我们认为很好。
    关于统一“铺灰器”的格式问题，由于目前全国各地所采用的砖的规格还不一致，因而“铺灰器”的尺寸大小很难统一规定。现以北京砖的规格（250×120×60）制作的“铺灰器”为例，希望各地从事建筑工作的同志，根据当地情况仿照实行。
    砌单墙时，“铺灰器”的宽为二十五公分，长为四十点五公分，高为三十二公分。形似一斗，下面空着，在“铺灰器”底面的两边有厚六公厘、宽十五公厘、长四百八十公厘的铁条两根用钉连于“铺灰器”，骑在墙上。铁条的两端跷起，每边缩口约一公分半到两公分，一边有一铁片靠住外墙面，使
    “铺灰器”能有依靠。“铺灰器”的两头有倾斜的出灰槽板，距离砖面一公分，槽板处有三道或四道缺口，这样灰浆厚度恰好一公分，并有三道或四道较厚的灰，供挤浆用，这个出灰板可以自由翻动，如灰浆窝铺有薄厚现象，可用插销条插在另一个眼上，进行调节。
    斗形“铺灰器”的中间有一块成四十五度倾斜的活翻板（或钉住不动）。这样就能使灰由斜坡滑下。有了活翻板后，在遇到门窗口或顶头时，可以将翻板翻过来，装一些灰反铺过来，这样就克服了过去铺灰铺不到顶头的缺点。
    “铺灰器”应该用铁条骑在墙上，这样才能使
    “铺灰器”及灰的重量平均承受在几块砖上，并可以把砖面上不平的地方压平，不致因使用有轱辘
    （即小铁轮）“铺灰器”，遇到砖缝时便发生高低跳动现象。
    “铺灰器”漏浆处，应倾斜着，着砖的宽度以六 —十公分为宜，因与砖的接触面小，阻力就小，推动轻便，灰浆放在斗内不推动时，水分也不致被砖吸去，同时漏下的灰浆也很均匀。
    “铺灰器”用单面铁片靠住墙的一边，在墙的转角处能够铺满灰浆，使用时应用手将“铺灰器”按靠住墙边。
