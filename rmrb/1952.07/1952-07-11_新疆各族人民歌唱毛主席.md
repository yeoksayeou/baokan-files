The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang deeply love their great leader Chairman Mao, and they sing his praises in various languages. Thousands upon thousands of poems of praise are widely circulated among the people of all nationalities.

Long before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a certain unit of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army crossed the snow-covered Qilian Mountains and entered Xinjiang. They, along with the Chinese Communists who later came to Xinjiang to engage in anti-Japanese work, brought the voice of Chairman Mao to the people of all nationalities, educating them about the path to national and national liberation. Later, Sheng Shicai and the Kuomintang bandit gang carried out a brutal massacre of Chinese Communists and outstanding sons and daughters of all nationalities, but the people of all nationalities never forgot Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. They looked forward day and night to the arrival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Finally, in the winter of 1949, this hope was realized. The Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, and the people of all nationalities were overjoyed. They sang:

	Our savior, you have come at the right time,
	The people of all nationalities are longing for you,
	The people of all nationalities welcome you.
	We pay tribute to you, heroes who liberated the motherland.
	In the days when we were oppressed,
	We were thinking of you,
	Waiting for your arrival,
	We know that only Chairman Mao can liberate us.
	(Uyghur Folk Song)

	The red flag flutters on the Tianshan Mountains,
	Like a bird spreading its wings and flying in the sky,
	Behind the red flag follow Mao Zedong's soldiers,
	Thousands upon thousands, brave and strong,
	Wherever the red flag is planted,
	The people there are liberated.

	We Uyghur people cheer in unison,
	Cheering for the red flag planted on the Pamir Plateau,
	Embroidered on the red flag is Chairman Mao's image,
	His finger points to the East where the sun rises,
	He smiles and watches the people of the Tarim Basin,
	He calls on us to embark on the road to freedom and happiness.
	(Uyghur Folk Song)

After the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, they annihilated the U.S. imperialist armed spy Usman bandit gang. The Xinjiang Party Committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xinjiang People's Governments at all levels were successively established. People of all nationalities came in an endless stream to the Party committees and people's governments at all levels to pour out their suffering and put forward their hopes and demands. The cadres of the Party and the people's government brought the voice of Chairman Mao to the countryside and pastoral areas. The people of all nationalities sang:

	Mao Zedong leads us to get light,
	He is our backing, we are reborn.
	Mao Zedong comforted the wounded hearts of ethnic minorities,
	Mao Zedong gave ethnic minorities a bright future.
	(Russian Folk Song)

	Respectfully wish leader Mao Zedong, may you live ten thousand years.
	The victory of the People's Liberation Army, the victory of the people,
	Annihilated the U.S. imperialist dog Usman,
	Unite our people of all nationalities to build a new Xinjiang.
	Let us live a free and happy life forever.
	(Kazakh Folk Song)

Starting in 1950, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, Xinjiang launched a large-scale production movement. The People's Liberation Army reclaimed patches of oasis in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, built large-scale water conservancy projects, and repaired long-abandoned canals. The call of Wang Zhen, Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Turn barren mountains into fertile fields, and turn the Gobi into an oasis." became the common effort of the People's Liberation Army and the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to build a new Xinjiang. The trade work cadres of the People's Government went deep into the rural and pastoral areas, developed the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and improved the lives of the people of all nationalities. The people of all nationalities sang:

	Xinjiang used to be a desert locked in ice and snow,
	Today it will become a garden,
	Opening up beautiful flowers.
	We must transform the Gobi and the ice mountains,
	The people of the Mao Zedong era,
	Use labor to create everything.
	(Uyghur Folk Song)

	Play the strings and sing under the moon,
	Singing about our happy life.
	In the past, we wept bitterly,
	Now joyful songs ring out on the grassland;
	In the past, the rivers were dry,
	Now the source is full of water.
	Respected leader Chairman Mao, we swear to you:
	"We will work hard to graze cattle and sheep,
	Build the frontier of our great motherland."

	Mao Zedong is the sun,
	He turns the grassland green,
	He illuminates the hills,
	The horses are galloping happily,
	The sheep are singing,
	The sun shines in our hearts,
	We are prosperous and our livestock are also prosperous.
	(Kyrgyz Folk Song)

In the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, rent reduction was carried out in the rural areas of Xinjiang. In the rent reduction movement, the peasants more deeply experienced that Chairman Mao was the great savior of the people of all nationalities in China, and that following Chairman Mao meant victory. After the rent reduction, the peasants' enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights, the face of the countryside was renewed, and the people of all nationalities sang:

	Play our "Dutar",
	Beat our hand drums,
	Come on, men and women farmers,
	Let us sing loudly:
	Thank the savior Mao Zedong,
	Lead us to turn ourselves over,
	Struggle against the bullies and reduce rent,
	Peasants are masters of their own affairs.
	Uyghurs know their gratitude,
	Wish leader Mao Zedong from afar,
	Good health and long life.

	(Uyghur Folk Song)

	A pair of white doves,
	Flying in the blue sky,
	Please stretch your wings down,

	Mao Zedong cares for us all the time,
	We respectfully wish leader Chairman Mao a long life,
	May it last as long as heaven and earth, like the sun and moon shining on the people.
	(Russian Folk Song)

The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang use the most beautiful poems to praise the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. A song circulating on the Pamir Plateau goes like this:

	Chairman Mao is like a red sun,
	Shining on the Pamir Plateau,
	Reviving our Tajik nation,
	Bringing us lasting light and youth.
	We use our own red hearts,
	Dipped in our own blood,
	To write thousands of songs of praise,
	Singing about you—our savior, Chairman Mao.
	(Tajik Folk Song)

    新疆各族人民热爱自己伟大的领袖毛主席，他们以各种不同的语言歌颂他。成千成万首赞美的诗歌，广泛地流传在各族人民中间。
    远在抗日战争之前，中国工农红军某部就曾越过积雪茫茫的祁连山进入新疆，他们和以后到新疆从事抗日工作的中国共产党人，给各族人民带来了毛主席的声音，教育各族人民知道了祖国和民族解放之路。后来，盛世才和国民党匪帮对于中国共产党人和各族人民的优秀儿女进行了残酷的屠杀，但各族人民却没有一刻忘却了毛主席和中国共产党，他们日夜盼望着中国人民解放军的到来。终于在一九四九年冬天，这个希望达到了，中国人民解放军进驻新疆，各族人民莫不欢欣鼓舞，他们歌唱道：
    我们的救星你们来得好，
