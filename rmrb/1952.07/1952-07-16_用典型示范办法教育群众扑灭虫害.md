    Educating the Masses to Eradicate Pests Using Model Demonstrations

    Editor: Not long ago, rice seedlings in Anxi District, Xinfeng County, Jiangxi Province, were infested with rice borers, *Hydronomus alismatis*, and hard-shelled insects. Some of the masses said, "It doesn't matter. It happens every year. The sun will kill them, and a storm will blow them away." The district people's government mobilized the masses to catch insects, but some backward masses believed that the insects were divine insects, and they slaughtered pigs and prayed to the gods to take the insects back.

    Under these circumstances, ordering the masses to kill insects would only create more difficulties for the work. Facts have proven that only by convincing the masses with facts can we truly mobilize them to eradicate pests. The insect-catching work in Anxi Township was mainly the responsibility of the Communist Youth League. The Youth League branch first convened a branch meeting to mobilize members, and then concentrated all the league members in Qianjin Di (place name), where the insect infestation was the most severe, to implement a typical demonstration of pest control. On the same day, all the pests in Qianjin Di were eliminated. Under the influence of the Youth League members, all villages began to control insects and launched a competition. In three days, the insect-catching work in the whole township was a complete victory. Eight hundred and eighty people participated in the insect-catching, accounting for 61 percent of the township's population.

    Later, other townships in the district followed this method. In five days at most and three days at least, they basically eliminated the pests.

    Through this insect control movement, the masses in the whole district generally established the idea that "man can conquer nature" and overcame the superstitious idea of divine insects. Zhong Dingcheng, a poor peasant from Longzhou Township, said, "In previous years, when there were insect plagues, the landlords led us to 'kill chickens and slaughter pigs' and 'burn incense and set off firecrackers.' We spent a lot of money and used a lot of labor, but we still watched helplessly as the rice seedlings were killed, and everyone blamed God for being unkind. But the landlords took the opportunity to lend money at high interest rates and exploit us even more. Now we can see clearly." Wang Xijun

### 用典型示范办法教育群众扑灭虫害

    用典型示范办法教育群众扑灭虫害
    编辑同志：不久以前，江西信丰县安息区的禾苗发生了螟虫、护泥虫和硬壳虫。一部分群众说：“不要紧，每年都有，太阳会晒死它，一场风雨也会吹打死它。”区人民政府发动群众捕虫，部分落后群众认为虫是神虫，杀猪求神把虫收回。
    在这种情况下，如果下命令让群众打虫，就会给工作造成更多的困难。事实证明，只有用事实来说服群众，才能真正发动群众扑灭虫害。安息乡的捕虫工作主要由青年团负责。青年团支部首先召开支部大会，进行动员，随后把全乡团员集中在全乡虫害最厉害的千斤?（地名），实行治虫典型示范，当天就把全?的害虫消灭完了。在青年团员影响之下，各村都开始治虫，并展开了比赛，三天功夫，全乡捕虫工作获得了全胜。参加捕虫的人有八百八十人，占全乡人口百分之六十一。
    后来，该区其他各乡都照着这个办法做，多则五天，少则三天，基本上都把害虫消灭了。
    经过这次治虫运动，全区群众一般树立了“人定胜天”的思想，克服了迷信神虫思想。龙州乡贫农锺定成说：“往年闹虫灾，地主领导我们‘杀鸡宰猪’，‘烧香放炮’，我们花了很多钱，用了许多工，还是眼巴巴地看着禾苗被害死，大伙还怪老天爷不饶人。可是地主趁机放高利贷，加倍剥削我们。现在可看清了。”       王希俊
