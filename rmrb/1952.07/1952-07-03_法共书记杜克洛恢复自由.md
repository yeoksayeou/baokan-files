Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 2nd dispatch: French Communist Party Secretary and member of the French National Assembly, Duclos, was released on July 1st. That evening, he walked out of the Santé Prison, where he had been illegally imprisoned for a month, amidst the cheers of the people of Paris. This is a major victory in the struggle waged by the people of France and the people of the world.

The French government, in releasing Duclos, had to admit that its conspiracy to frame him under the direction of its American masters had failed. On the evening of May 28th, the reactionary French authorities groundlessly arrested Duclos on his way home, falsely claiming that he was directing the demonstrations of the people of Paris against Ridgway, thereby committing the so-called "crime of endangering national internal security," and that he was caught in the act, and therefore could not enjoy the privilege of members of parliament not being arrested as stipulated by the constitution. For a month, the reactionary French authorities searched the headquarters and local organizations of the French Communist Party and various democratic groups, and arrested communists and patriotic people everywhere, attempting to fabricate "evidence" to prove that Duclos had committed a crime against the state, and attempting to launch a larger-scale fascist suppression of the French Communist Party and French democratic forces. However, their clumsy tactics were thoroughly exposed by Duclos and his defense lawyers. At the same time, the people of France and the world launched a powerful protest movement demanding the release of Duclos. After a month of struggle, the French government and its American masters had exhausted all their tricks, and they all went bankrupt. Finally, five days after Duclos's defense lawyer formally requested the Paris Court of Appeal on June 27th to order the restoration of Duclos's freedom, the Paris Court of Appeal had to admit that Duclos was not "caught in the act of endangering national internal security," and therefore, according to the constitution, he must be released immediately.

After the French government and its American masters suffered a disastrous defeat in their conspiracy to persecute the leader of the French Communist Party, they were not willing to give up their plan to continue persecuting Duclos and all democrats. The American Associated Press and United Press International have revealed that the French judicial authorities have refused to release Stieglitz, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," who was arrested three days earlier than Duclos, and that "the government may use new charges" to continue persecuting Duclos.

    法共书记杜克洛恢复自由
    【新华社二日讯】巴黎消息：法国共产党书记、法国国民议会议员杜克洛已在七月一日获得释放。当天晚上已经在巴黎人民的欢呼声中走出了被非法监禁了一个月的桑台监狱。这是法国人民和全世界人民进行斗争的一个重大胜利。
    法国政府在释放杜克洛的时候，不得不承认它在美国主子指挥下所设的陷害阴谋已归于失败。五月二十八日晚上，法国反动当局在杜克洛回家路上无端逮捕了杜克洛，硬说他是在指挥巴黎人民反对李奇微的示威，因而犯了所谓“危害国家内部安全罪”，而且是当场被捕的，因而不得享受宪法规定议员不受逮捕的特权。法国反动当局又在一个月来搜查了法国共产党和各民主团体的总部和地方组织，并且到处逮捕共产党员和爱国志士，企图制造出什么“证据”来证实杜克洛犯了国事罪，并且企图由此对法国共产党和法国民主力量发动更大规模的法西斯的镇压。但是，他们这种拙劣的手法被杜克洛和他的辩护律师彻底拆穿了。同时，全法国和全世界人民展开了强大的抗议运动，要求释放杜克洛。经过一个月的斗争，法国政府及其美国主子的一切花样都使尽了，也都破产了。终于在杜克洛的辩护律师在六月二十七日正式要求巴黎上诉法院判决恢复杜克洛自由之后的第五天，巴黎上诉法院不得不承认杜克洛并非在“犯危害国家内部安全时当场被捕”的，因此按照宪法，必须立即予以开释。
    法国政府及其美国主子在迫害法共领袖的阴谋遭受惨败后，他们并没有甘心放弃继续迫害杜克洛和一切民主分子的打算。美国的合众社和美联社都曾透露，法国司法当局已经拒绝释放比杜克洛早三天被捕的“人道报”总编辑斯梯，而且“政府还可能用新的罪名”来继续迫害杜克洛。
