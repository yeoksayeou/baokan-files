    Correct the Bad Practice of Falsely Reporting Achievements
    To the Editor: In the movements of full loading, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers, some units of the Tianjin Railway Administration have serious and bad phenomena of falsely reporting achievements. On June 30th, the Statistics Office of the Tianjin Railway Administration investigated the loading situation of the entire administration and found that many stations falsely reported the number of loaded cars. Kouquan Station over-reported by 96 cars, Daye Station over-reported by 57 cars, and Tianjin Station over-reported by 55 cars. Such false reporting of achievements will cause the leading organs to lose the real basis when formulating plans, affecting the normal progress of the entire national transportation. I suggest that the relevant leading organs must correct this bad phenomenon, severely criticize the erroneous thinking of certain on-site leading cadres and statistical personnel, and improve the political level of statistical personnel.

    纠正假报成绩的恶劣作风
    编辑同志：在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，天津铁路管理局某些单位有着严重的假报成绩的恶劣现象。六月三十日，天津铁路管理局统计处调查全局装车情况，发现不少车站假报装车数。口泉车站多报了九十六车，大冶车站多报了五十七车，天津车站多报了五十五车。这样假报成绩，将使领导机关编制计划时，失掉真实的根据，影响了整个国家运输的正常进行。我建议有关领导机关必须纠正这种不良现象，严厉批判某些现场领导干部、统计人员的错误思想，提高统计人员的政治水平。
