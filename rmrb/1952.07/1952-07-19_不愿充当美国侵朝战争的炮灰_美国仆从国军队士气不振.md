Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 18th: "Pravda" published a dispatch from its correspondent in Pyongyang, Dekachenko, who wrote:

	Since the American imperialist gamble in the Korean War is obviously a losing game, and the U.S.'s deliberate delay of the armistice talks has shattered hopes for an early return home, the soldiers of the so-called "United Nations forces" are all panicking and full of resentment.

	They can see clearly who has plundered Korea's gold and tungsten, who uses blood and lives to exchange for these, who feasts in Korean hotels, and who endures hunger and cold in the trenches.

	Dekachenko excerpted letters, diaries, and confessions from captured "United Nations forces" officers and soldiers from Korean newspapers, proving that the American war of aggression against Korea is extremely unpopular among the puppet armies of the United States, who are extremely dissatisfied with the discriminatory treatment of being driven by the U.S. military to serve as cannon fodder.

	Five captured soldiers and a second lieutenant of the British Gloucestershire Regiment said in a joint letter published in "Labor News": We five British soldiers and many others deeply resent the so-called "police action" in Korea. We have learned that this action is actually a failed gamble by the United States under the banner of the United Nations. We have personally witnessed the inhumane slaughter of Korean children and women and the destruction of their homes by the U.S. Air Force, and we deeply believe how despicable and shameless the Americans are. We now understand that it is time for people of all countries to hear the truth about this dirty business. We do not want to participate in this dirty war, so we surrendered.

	Korean newspapers published a letter from 234 British prisoners of war in the first and fifth prisoner-of-war camps in North Korea to the British Minister of Defense, Alexander. The letter expressed impatience with the delaying tactics of the U.S. delegation at the Panmunjom negotiation conference and requested the British government to do its best to end the senseless bloodshed in Korea.

	A French soldier named Andre wrote: The Americans have been deceiving people since the first few months of the Korean War. They drove us to the battlefield, while they hid far in the rear. We stayed in the trenches day and night, while the American infantry enjoyed themselves in the rear. Several hundred people in our battalion were sacrificed, and almost all were replenished three times. If the armistice agreement is not concluded, the United States will put our entire battalion to death.

	A Turkish prisoner of war said: Our brigade has been replenished three times, almost two-thirds of the people. The American devils treat us Turkish soldiers worse than cattle and horses. They keep driving us to fight.

	Sergeant James of the Philippine 10th Battalion said: These Americans look down on blacks and Filipinos the most, and they treat us as inferior people. Several companies of the Philippine Expeditionary Force have been replenished six times. Now, not a single Philippine soldier does not hate this war launched by these Americans.

	Dekachenko also cited several examples of the so-called "allied forces" soldiers' dissatisfaction with the U.S. military, such as voluntarily surrendering, deserting, going slow on orders from American officers, and sabotaging weapons. He pointed out that the predatory war launched by American imperialism in Korea is extremely unpopular among the "allied forces" soldiers. They fight listlessly and without confidence in this unjust war, which naturally does not produce any heroism or heroes.

### 不愿充当美国侵朝战争的炮灰  美国仆从国军队士气不振

    不愿充当美国侵朝战争的炮灰
    美国仆从国军队士气不振
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”刊载了该报驻平壤记者德卡诚科的一篇通讯，他写道：
    由于美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的战争赌博显然是一场输局，而美国故意拖延停战谈判又使得早日回家的希望成了泡影，所谓“联合国军”的兵士个个都很着慌，满肚子都是怨气。
    谁抢走了朝鲜的黄金和钨，谁用鲜血和生命来换取这些，谁在朝鲜大饭店里大吃大喝，谁在战壕里面忍受饥寒，这一些，他们都看清楚了。
    德卡诚科从朝鲜报纸上摘录了被俘的“联合国军”官兵的书信、日记和供词，证明了美国发动的侵朝战争在美国的仆从军队中十分不得人心，他们对于美军驱使他们充当炮灰的歧视行为极为不满。
    英国格罗斯忒团五个被俘的兵士和少尉在登在“劳动新闻”的一封联名信上说：我们五个英国兵士以及其他的许多人对于朝鲜的所谓“警察行动”是深恶痛绝的。我们已了解到：这种行动实际上是美国打着联合国的旗帜所干的一场失败的赌博。我们亲眼看见美国空军毫无人道地屠杀朝鲜儿童和妇女并破坏他们的家园，我们深深相信美国人的所作所为是多么卑鄙无耻。我们现在已经明白：现在应该是世界各国人民倾听这种肮脏事情的真相的时候了。我们不想参加这种肮脏战争，因此我们投降了。
    朝鲜报纸登载了在北朝鲜的第一号和第五号战俘营英国战俘二百三十四人给英国国防大臣亚历山大的一封信。这封信对于美国代表团在板门店谈判会议上的拖延行为表示不耐，并要求英国政府尽力设法结束在朝鲜的无谓流血牺牲。
    一个名叫安德列的法国兵写道：美国人从朝鲜战争最初的几个月起就在欺骗人。他们把我们赶到战场上去，而自己则躲在远远的后方。我们日日夜夜呆在战壕里，而美国步兵则在后方逍遥自在。我们这一营牺牲了好几百人，几乎全部补充了三次。如果停战协定还不缔结，美国就要把我们整个的营置之死地。
    一个土耳其战俘说：我们这一旅补充了三次几乎补充了三分之二的人。美国佬对待我们土耳其兵士比对待牛马还不如。他们不停地赶我们去打仗。
    菲律宾第十营的詹姆斯上士说：这些美国佬最瞧不起黑人和菲律宾人，他们把我们当劣等人看待。菲律宾远征部队的几连已补充了六次。现在没有一个菲律宾兵士不恨这些美国人发动的这个战争。
    德卡诚科还引用了所谓“联军”兵士不满美军的若干事例，例如自动投诚、开小差、对美国军官的命令怠工、搞坏武器等。他指出：美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的掠夺性战争在“联军”士兵中是十分不得人心的。他们在这种非正义的战争中没精打采地、毫无信心地作战，这自然不会产生什么英雄主义和英雄。
