Young Students Fighting on the Water Conservancy Front
    Ke Lidan

    Our forty-odd young comrades from the Ministry of Water Conservancy who participated in the Jingjiang River Diversion Project have returned victoriously. The southern sun has tanned their faces red and black, and each face shows a youthful smile. When we met and shook hands, everyone said almost the same thing: "Our motherland is changing so fast, everything is advancing at a rapid pace. Two and a half months ago, this place was just a wilderness, but now huge buildings are standing tall." Everyone excitedly talked about the situation when representatives from various countries attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference visited the Jingjiang Project: The American representative was surprised and said that such a project would take at least three years to complete in the United States, even with the latest equipment. But we did it not in three years, but in two and a half months. What else is needed to illustrate the superiority of our people's motherland?

    Every young person is proud of the motherland. Some young people working in the water conservancy department feel full of strength and enthusiasm every day just by calculating some familiar numbers that are rising in a straight line. In two years, our country has completed a total of 960 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects. This number is more than five times the excavation volume of the Panama Canal and nearly thirteen times the excavation volume of the Suez Canal. If these soils were built into a levee one meter high and one meter wide, it could circle the earth twenty-four times. In the Huai River, we conquered the floods that had been harmful for years in history. How happy everyone was when they read the news that tens of millions of acres of land in the Huai River basin had a bumper harvest! In the Yellow River, we built the Shitou Zhuang detention basin project to divert abnormal floods, and for the first time in history, we diverted the water of the Yellow River for irrigation. The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River had been talked about since the time of the Northern Warlords, and not a single clod of earth had been moved until the Kuomintang reactionary government collapsed; and we built this reservoir, which has a water storage capacity equal to one-sixth of the Soviet Union's first communist construction project, the Tsimlyansk Sea, in one year.

    These are just the beginning. How many miracles will appear in our motherland. How many great works are still waiting for our hands to complete. This cannot but encourage us to forge ahead!

    Not long ago, when we were still studying at school, everyone had many ideals about their favorite work of building dams, power stations, and irrigation projects, but we never expected that the water conservancy construction of the motherland would advance so fast, and the motherland's need for us would be so urgent. A few classmates who graduated from university with me the year before last were assigned to work in Xinjiang. They accepted the arduous task of building a hydroelectric power station as soon as they "left the nest." It was indeed not an easy task for some inexperienced young people to carry out such a project for the first time in the remote Tianshan Mountains, the Gobi Desert, and the vast grasslands. But what is there to be afraid of? There is the leadership and education of the Communist Party, and the support of millions of PLA soldiers participating in the project. They solemnly vowed to undertake this glorious task. They boldly broke the old rules they had learned from American books, gave play to the creativity of young people, closely relied on the workers, solved many technical difficulties, and saved a large amount of wealth for the motherland.

    This shows that the motherland not only needs us to move forward but has also arranged a path for us to move forward. Whoever earnestly follows Chairman Mao's instruction to "integrate with workers and peasants" can move forward by leaps and bounds. The comrades who participated in the Jingjiang River Diversion Project all felt that they had received the most vivid and profound education among the PLA soldiers, workers, and peasants participating in the project. Many impressions will never be erased. At the Jingjiang construction site, once, when the PLA soldiers were carrying soil to the dike, a soldier fell and the soil basket in his hand rolled into the river. Without any hesitation, the soldier jumped into the rapids and pulled the basket up. Soaked all over, he jumped and ran back into the fiery working team. Another time, a female bulldozer operator had her finger bone crushed by a overturned vehicle. She was in so much pain that she almost fainted. Her companions wanted to send her back, but she raised her head and shouted, "Comrades! You go to work! Don't worry about me! Completing the task is the most important thing!" Such vivid and moving things happened every day, engraved time and time again in the depths of the minds of young intellectuals. Everyone felt: "Love for the motherland's property and love for labor are fixed things in the minds of our soldiers, workers, and peasants that are not affected by anything. They only remember collective interests and collective undertakings. Unlike us intellectuals who have not been well-transformed, we first think of personal interests when encountering problems and must go through a series of ideological struggles to correct ourselves." Working with these heroic soldiers, workers, and peasants, young intellectuals overcame their weaknesses and displayed fiery enthusiasm. Of the forty-odd young comrades sent by the Ministry of Water Conservancy, twenty-six received awards for their meritorious service. Comrade Zhang Huai, a young member of the Communist Youth League who had just graduated from Tianjin University in February this year, stayed with the workers for several days and nights during the Jingjiang River Diversion Project, soaking in waist-deep water to protect a bridge and ensure smooth transportation. Once, the heavy flood washed away a section of light railway along the river. He and the workers went into the water to find a way to retrieve the rails. He said, "PLA soldiers are not willing to lose a basket, can we let a kilometer of railway be washed away by the water?" In this way, Comrade Zhang Huai was finally named a special-class hero.

    In our work, the motherland educates us with living facts: Any great cause of the people is accumulated by the labor of many people, bit by bit. The illusions that many of us had in the past of relying on individuals to "do something earth-shattering" have also been corrected step by step. The comrades who participated in the Jingjiang River Diversion Project felt that everyone's work on the construction site seemed very ordinary. But it is in these ordinary works that you carry a basket of soil, and I shovel a shovel of cement, and a huge project appears. Many of us used to dislike sitting in the office, and were even more afraid of doing charts and statistics, thinking that such work was "meaningless"; the facts of the past two years have told us that our country can complete such a great project as the Jingjiang River Diversion Project in a very short period of time because all aspects of the work are done well. There is a comrade here who was assigned by the organization to do flood control report work, registering the flow, water level, and rainfall reported from various places every day, and making charts. At first, he thought this work was boring and uneasy. Now, he proudly tells everyone that the lives and property of hundreds of millions of people along the rivers, and the harvest of hundreds of millions of acres of land, are directly related to his work. A mistake made by a comrade made everyone feel the serious responsibility of this work even more. Last August, the middle reaches of the Yellow River flooded, and the flow was very large. A comrade working at a hydrological station in a certain place carelessly calculated a flow figure (later found to be twice as large as the actual flow). An telegram was sent out, and hundreds of miles downstream were shaken. Tens of thousands of farmers went to the dike to guard it, wasting a day. Some places were afraid of being flooded, so they harvested the wheat early before it was fully ripe. Due to this comrade's negligence, the people suffered huge losses. Kalinin taught young people: "...Ordinary daily work occupies ninety-nine percent of a person's life time. The most valuable quality of party workers is to be good at working happily even in ordinary and common environments...Never forget the ultimate goal that communism is striving for." Many comrades have realized the great significance of this sentence in their practical work. It has become the force that drives us forward!

    在水利战线上战斗着的青年学生们
    柯礼聃
    我们水利部参加荆江分洪工程的四十几个青年同志胜利归来了。南方的太阳锻炼出了几十张又红又黑的脸，每个脸庞上都显露着青春的欢笑。见面握手时，每个人几乎都说了这样一句相同的话：“我们祖国就是变得快，一切都在飞速地前进，两个半月以前还是一片荒草的地方，现在却耸立起庞大的建筑物。”大家兴高采烈地谈起参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的各国代表参观荆江工程时的情形：美国代表惊奇地说，这样的工程，在美国用最新的设备施工，也得至少三年才能完成。而我们呢，不是三年，而是两个半月。还需要用什么去说明我们人民祖国的优越性呢？
    每一个青年都为祖国自豪。在水利部门工作的一些青年，每天只要计算一下自己所熟悉的一些成直线上升的数目字，就觉得满身充满了力量和热情。两年中，我们全国的水利工程共完成土方九亿六千万立方公尺。这个数字等于巴拿马运河掘土数字的五倍多，将近苏彝士运河掘土数字的十三倍。这些土如果筑成一道一公尺高、一公尺宽的长堤，可以围绕地球二十四周。在淮河，我们征服了历史上长年为害的洪水。当大家读到淮河流域数千万亩土地丰收的消息时，多么高兴啊！在黄河，我们修建了分泄异常洪水的石头庄滞洪工程，并且破天荒地把黄河的水引来灌溉。永定河的官厅水库，从北洋军阀时期开始叫嚷，一直到国民党反动政府垮台为止，没曾动过一撮土；而我们在一年之内，把这个蓄水量等于苏联第一个共产主义建设工程——齐姆良海的六分之一的大水库筑成了。
    这些，都还是刚刚在开始。我们的祖国还有多少奇迹将要出现。我们的双手还要完成多少伟大的工作。这不能不鼓舞我们奋勇前进！
    不久以前，当我们还在学校学习的时候，每个人都对自己心爱的修筑闸坝、建造水电站、开凿灌溉工程等工作抱有许多理想，但想不到祖国的水利建设会前进得这样快，祖国对我们的需要有这样迫切。前年和我一道在大学毕业的同学，有几个分派到新疆工作。“初出茅庐”就接受了修建一个水电站的艰巨任务。在遥远的天山、戈壁之间，在辽阔的草原上首次搞这样的工程，对于一些缺乏经验的青年的确不是一件容易的事。但怕什么呢？有共产党的领导和教育，有千百万参加工程的解放军战士的支援。他们庄严地宣誓担负起了这个光荣的任务。他们大胆地打破过去从美国书本上所学到的成规，发挥青年人的创造性，紧紧地依靠工人，解决了许多技术上的困难，还给祖国节省了大批财富。
    这说明祖国不但需要我们前进，而且给我们安排好了前进的道路。谁只要认真做到毛主席的指示“和工农兵结合”，谁就能大踏步前进。参加荆江分洪工程的同志谈起来，每个人都感到自己在参加工程的解放军战士和工人、农民中间受了最生动、最深刻的教育。有许多印象是永远不会磨灭的。在荆江工地上，有一次，当解放军战士们抬着土往堤上冲的时候，一个战士摔了一跤，手里的抬土筐子滚到河里去了。这个战士没有丝毫踌躇，扑通一下就跳进激流里，把筐子捞了上来。全身湿淋淋地，又跳着跑着投入了火热地劳动着的队伍。又一次，一个推土的女工手指骨被翻倒的车子压碎了，她痛得几乎昏过去，同伴们要送她回去，可是她昂起头喊着：“同志们！你们干活去！别管我！完成任务要紧！”像这样生动感人的事情每天发生着，一次又一次地刻印到年青知识分子们的思想深处。大家感到：“热爱祖国财产、热爱劳动，在我们的战士和工人、农民头脑里是一种不受任何影响的固定的东西。他们只记得集体利益和集体事业，绝不像我们这些没有经过很好改造的知识分子，碰到问题时首先想到个人的利益，必须经过一番思想斗争才能扭正。”在和这些英雄的战士、工人、农民一块工作中，青年知识分子克服了自己的弱点，发挥了火一样的热情。水利部派去的四十几个青年同志，有二十六人立了功。今年二月刚从天津大学毕业的青年团员张槐同志，在这次荆江分洪工程中，曾经几昼夜和工人在一起，泡在没腰的深水里抢护一道桥梁，保证了运输的畅通。有一次，大水冲淹了江边一段轻便铁道，他和工人们一道下水想办法把铁轨捞起。他说：“解放军战士不肯丢掉一个筐子，我们能让一公里长的铁轨被水冲走吗？”就是这样，张槐同志最后被评为特等功臣。
    在我们的工作中，祖国用活生生的事实教育我们：人民的任何伟大事业，都是许多人一点一滴的劳动聚积起来的。过去我们许多人所抱的凭个人“轰轰烈烈干一番”的幻想，也一步一步得到了纠正。参加荆江分洪工程的同志们感到：在工地上，每个人的工作看来都是很平凡的。但就在这些平凡的工作中，你一筐土，我一铲洋灰，巨大的工程就出现了。我们以前有许多人不喜欢坐办公室，更怕做图表统计工作，认为这样的工作“没意思”；两年来的事实告诉我们，我们的国家能够在很短时间里完成像荆江分洪工程那样伟大的工程，就是靠各方面的工作都做得好。我们这里有一位同志，组织上分派他做防汛表报工作，每天登记各地报来的流量、水位和雨量，制成图表。起初，他认为这工作很枯燥、不安心。现在，他自豪地和大家谈，各河流沿岸亿万人民生命财产，亿万亩土地的收成，都和他的工作有直接的关系。有一个同志发生的过失，更使大家感到这一工作的严重责任。去年八月，黄河中游涨水，流量很大，在某地水文站工作的一个同志，马马虎虎计算了一个流量数字（后来发现比实际流量大一倍），一个电报发出去，下游数百里地都震动了，成千成万的农民上堤守护，荒废了一天时间。有的地方怕被水淹，麦子还没有全熟就提早收割了。由于这个同志的疏忽，造成了人民的巨大损失。加里宁教导青年说：“……平凡的日常工作竟占据一个人百分之九十九的生活时间。党工作人员最宝贵的品质，就是要善于在普通平常环境中也兴高采烈地工作……永远也不忘记共产主义所奋斗的这种终极目标。”许多同志都在自己的实际工作中体会到了这句话的伟大意义。它变成了推动我们前进的力量！
