    How State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Northeast China Should Promote Advanced Experiences
    By Our Reporter Gu Weijin
    Northeast China's state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have made significant achievements in promoting advanced production experiences. Over the past few years, the working class of Northeast China, with selfless dedication, has worked diligently, humbly learned from the Soviet Union, and continuously created many advanced production experiences. These advanced experiences have played a huge role in improving the equipment capacity of industrial and mining enterprises, increasing output, improving quality, reducing costs, raising workers' technical level, and changing the production outlook of industrial and mining enterprises. Among these advanced production experiences, the most decisive are: in the iron and steel industry, the rapid steelmaking method in open-hearth furnaces, which can greatly shorten smelting time. Considering the existing open-hearth furnace equipment, if the smelting time for each furnace of steel is shortened by 30 minutes, it can increase steel production by hundreds of thousands of tons per year. In the coal mining industry, there is Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method, with a daily tunneling speed of over 40 meters, more than doubling the general tunneling efficiency. The Xi'an Coal Mine created the parallel operation method for vertical shafts, which can shorten the construction time of a vertical shaft by half. The Ma Wenzhi team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau created the rapid drilling method, which can increase drilling efficiency by nearly three times. In the machinery industry, there are high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods, which can increase production efficiency by one to five times, with a maximum of seventeen times. In the machinery and electrical industries, there is the "organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts" work method. Implementing this Soviet advanced production experience can overcome the phenomenon of alternating slack and tension caused by unbalanced production, and also specialize labor division. In the construction industry, there is Su Changyou's segmented bricklaying method and double-handed mortar squeezing method, which can increase labor efficiency by 400%, not only greatly reducing project costs but also substantially solving the difficulty of finding skilled workers. In the paper industry, there is the rapid cooking method, which can increase the daily output of pulp from 4.3 tanks to 9 tanks, which will play a significant role in resolving pulp shortages. In the textile industry, the Hao Jianxiu work method and the "1951 Weaving Work Method" are now being vigorously promoted, and it is estimated that they can produce more than 2,000 additional bales of yarn and more than 360,000 bolts of cloth per year.
    In order to transform these advanced production experiences into the experiences of all employees and the wealth of the entire society, many industrial and mining enterprises are making every effort to promote them. To do a good job in promotion, enterprise leaders must first clearly recognize that the promotion of advanced production experiences is a fierce struggle between new and old technical thinking, give it sufficient attention and vigorous support, fear no obstruction, resolutely rely on the masses, and resolutely implement the promotion work.
    The Fuxin Mining Bureau's promotion of the Soviet "rapid drilling method" is a good example. In the past, the bureau's drilling work was inefficient, costly, and of poor quality due to backward technology, which could not meet the needs of resource investigation and affected the progress of the coal mining industry's basic construction work. In order to solve this problem, the bureau's leadership decided to learn the Soviet "rapid drilling method." Initially, they conveyed to the drilling teams the reports of Soviet experts on the new achievements of Soviet drilling, mobilized everyone to learn the Soviet "rapid drilling method," and encountered resistance from some workers' conservative thinking. They said, "What rapid drilling, turning so fast, won't the drill rod be twisted off?", "I have been doing this for more than ten years and have never heard of such a drilling method." In order to correct this erroneous understanding of the workers, the bureau's leadership immediately implemented specific guidance after conducting general mobilization. They sent cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, combined with technicians, to go deep into the field, cultivate typical teams, so as to promote general teams. They carried out in-depth ideological education on the Ma Wenzhi team, introduced this advanced experience in detail, fully prepared various application materials, and fully supported the fellow workers who lacked confidence. Some fellow workers said, "What if the drilling machine breaks down if we drill so fast?" The leading cadres said, "The leadership will be responsible if it breaks down." During the construction process, leading cadres and technicians personally arrived at the scene, improved management methods and technology together with the workers, and helped the workers solve various specific difficulties. The Ma Wenzhi team quickly learned the "rapid drilling method," and the drilling efficiency increased from 3 meters per day to more than 10 meters, more than doubling the efficiency of the general teams, while reducing accidents. However, the "rapid drilling method" of the Ma Wenzhi team could not be smoothly promoted for a while. Many drilling workers believed that this was an accidental success, and some backward workers even developed jealousy. The bureau's leadership was not shaken by these obstacles. They summarized the successful experience of the Ma Wenzhi team in learning advanced experience, carried out in-depth publicity and education among the workers, and at the same time organized visits, performances, and held award ceremonies to reward the Ma Wenzhi team. These practical educations improved the workers' level of awareness, and some workers began to accept this advanced experience. In order to consolidate the achievements of the promotion work, the bureau formed a mobile team headed by the Ma Wenzhi team to assist in solving the difficulties encountered by other teams when trying the "rapid drilling method." In this way, the promotion work gradually unfolded, and the drilling work achieved remarkable results. The bureau only completed 73% of the drilling task in January this year, which increased to 97% in March, and after April, it increased to 107%.
    The Machinery Industry Administration's promotion of the Soviet experience of "organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts" is also a good example. In the past, the production of a certain factory was often characterized by alternating slack and tension due to poor organization and management. The production capacity could not be fully utilized, and therefore the phenomenon of not being able to complete tasks occurred. The factory could only complete 53% of the planned output for its main products, and the quality was poor and the cost was high. Soviet expert Comrade Berekin once proposed establishing production instruction charts in order to eliminate this phenomenon of non-rhythmic production. However, the factory did not implement this proposal well. Last year, the Machinery Industry Administration instructed the factory to learn this Soviet advanced experience. Sha Ping, the newly appointed director of the factory, did not understand technology, but she had the spirit of learning Soviet advanced production experience and the confidence to rely on the masses to run the enterprise well. She first organized the section chiefs, stock chiefs, and workshop cadres in the factory to jointly read the book "Organizing Rhythmic Work According to Instruction Charts" and study how to apply the Soviet advanced production experience to their own factory. At that time, some cadres were not interested in this Soviet advanced production experience. The cadres of the General Affairs Section believed that this work would require spending hundreds of millions of yuan to print charts, which would be equivalent to waste. The cadres of the Finance Section believed that this work would require increasing a lot of reserves, which would affect the turnover of funds. The workshop cadres believed that implementing this method would require delineating the progress of the operation, which was really troublesome. In order to overcome these ideological obstacles, Sha Ping and other Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres continued to mobilize cadres to study the book "Organizing Rhythmic Work According to Instruction Charts" in depth, and led everyone to discuss the significant role of implementing this advanced production experience in improving enterprise management, while studying and trying to make various instruction charts based on the learning experience. Everyone gradually understood that working according to instruction charts can make the work organized and methodical, which is much better than the past lack of organization and planned operation. However, some workers still had some concerns about implementing this advanced production experience. Due to the fact that the operation plans formulated by the leadership in the past were not thorough, and often had to be changed, some workers did not believe that it was possible to implement operations according to instruction charts. In addition, some workers knew that after the implementation of operations according to instruction charts, labor specialization would be implemented, and the organization would be adjusted, and the work that everyone was doing would be redistributed; if the new work was not familiar to them, they would earn less wages. They did not approve of implementing operations according to instruction charts. In order to eliminate these ideological concerns, the leadership first explained to the workers that even if the plan was not completed, the plan would not be changed casually when implementing operations according to instruction charts. At the same time, they explained to the workers the significance of implementing labor division specialization, which has a decisive role in improving the workers' technical level, improving production, and gradually improving the lives of employees on this basis. This improved the workers' understanding and eliminated the workers' ideological concerns. When the staff and workers generally recognized the superiority of the advanced experience of "Organizing Rhythmic Production According to Instruction Charts," the factory launched a red flag emulation movement to enable the staff and workers to give full play to their labor enthusiasm and raise backward production units to advanced production levels. In this way, the factory gradually implemented rhythmic and balanced production throughout the factory. On this basis, the factory's production outlook was completely renewed. The output gradually increased, and the output in March increased by 150% compared to January, and it nearly doubled in April. This year, the factory's production capacity will increase by two to three times. The quality of the products has also been gradually improved. The factory eliminated third-class products and unqualified products in January. There were no first-class products around November last year, but in the first quarter of this year, first-class products rose to 40%, and in April, they rose to 67%. The experience of the factory in promoting this advanced production experience proves that believing in and valuing the Soviet Union's advanced production experience, relying on the masses, overcoming difficulties, and strengthening ideological education are important parts of doing a good job in promoting advanced production experience.
    However, at present, there are still some industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China that have not done a good job in promoting advanced production experience. For example, in the textile industry system, the leading cadres of some factories still do not pay much attention to promoting advanced production experience. They are satisfied with the existing production achievements, not only thinking that the creations of the masses are "nothing great," but also not seriously promoting mature advanced production experience. When some factories promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, they did not carry out patient education of the staff and workers, nor did they cultivate typical examples or conduct demonstrations, but rather carried out a hasty comprehensive promotion, which affected the development of the promotion work. The coal mining industry system has created advanced production experiences such as Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method, the Ma Wenzhi team's rapid drilling method, and the vertical shaft parallel operation method. Although the Coal Mining Administration and other leading units have made decisions, issued instructions, and held mobilization meetings, calling on all mines to actively learn and promote these advanced experiences, after the instructions and mobilization, there is a lack of specific leadership (especially a lack of responsibility), and the promotion work is in a state of laissez-faire. Therefore, these advanced production experiences are currently limited to point promotion, and there is no mention of surface promotion. In the machinery industry system, some units do not pay attention to the promotion of high-speed cutting. The Machinery Industry Administration once organized a promotion team to assist in the promotion of high-speed cutting in various factories. However, the team lacked specific guidance and necessary help, and the technical level of the promoters could not meet the needs of the various factories. The workers in some factories actively demanded the implementation of high-speed cutting, but they lacked sufficient cutting tools, and the leadership did not provide support and help. These have affected the development of the promotion work. At present, the machine tools of the factories affiliated with the Machinery Industry Administration that truly implement high-speed cutting are not common enough (for example, more than 30% of the machine tools in factories in Shenyang have not yet adopted high-speed cutting). The advanced experience of "Organizing Rhythmic Production According to Instruction Charts" has attracted the attention of some enterprise leaders, but there are still many enterprise leaders who do not have a sufficient understanding of this advanced experience. Some people mistakenly regard this advanced production experience as the same as ordinary advanced production experience, thinking that "it doesn't matter whether it is promoted or not." Others refuse to promote this advanced production experience with the words "the conditions of the factory are insufficient" or "it is not suitable for the factory's situation." Due to the existence of these erroneous understandings, at present, this advanced production experience has not been promoted in most factories except for a few factories where it has been promoted.
    Promoting advanced production experience is the basic method to realize the production increase and economy plan. Units that have not done a good job in promoting advanced production experience must profoundly recognize the important significance of promoting advanced experience from an ideological point of view, humbly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, value the various advanced experiences created by the masses, and implement Comrade Gao Gang's instruction to "promote advanced production experience with leadership and organization."

    东北区国营工矿企业怎样推广先进经验
    本报记者  古维进
    东北区国营工矿企业推广先进生产经验，是有重大成绩的。几年以来，东北工人阶级奋不顾身地努力工作，虚心向苏联学习，连续创造了许多先进生产经验。这些先进经验对于提高工矿企业的设备能力，增加产量，改进质量，降低成本；提高工人技术水平，改变工矿企业的生产面貌，都起了巨大的作用。这些先进生产经验中最有决定意义的是：在钢铁工业中，有平炉快速炼钢法，它可以大大缩短溶炼时间。就现有的平炉设备说来，每炉钢的溶炼时间如果缩短三十分钟，一年就能增产多少万吨钢。在煤矿工业中，有崔国山的快速掘进法，每日的掘进速度达四十多公尺，比一般的掘进效率提高两倍多。西安煤矿创造了竖井平行作业法，建设一个竖井，可以缩短一半时间。阜新矿务局马文志小组创造了快速钻进法，它能使钻探效率提高将近三倍。在机械工业中，有高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，它能使生产效率提高一倍至五倍，最高达十七倍。在机械、机电工业中，有“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的工作法，实行这一苏联先进生产经验，可以克服由于生产不均衡所造成的忽松忽紧现象，又能使劳动分工专业化。在建筑工业中，有苏长有的分段砌砖法和双手挤浆法，它能使劳动效率提高百分之四百，不仅可以大大降低工程成本，而且可以大量解决技工的困难。在造纸工业中，有快速蒸煮法，它能使纸浆的日产量由四点三罐提高到九罐，对于解决纸浆困难将起重大作用。在纺织工业中，现正大力推广郝建秀工作法和“一九五一织布工作法”，预计一年可以多产两千余件纱，三十六万多匹布。
    为了把这些先进生产经验变成全体职工的经验和整个社会的财富，不少工矿企业正在全力进行推广工作。为了做好推广工作，企业领导干部首先要明确认识推广先进生产经验是新的技术思想和旧的技术思想的一场激烈斗争，给以足够的重视和大力的支持，不怕任何阻挠，坚决依靠群众，把推广工作坚决贯彻下去。
    阜新矿务局推广苏联的“快速钻进法”就是一个很好的例子。该局过去的钻探工作，由于技术落后，效率很低，成本很高，工程质量不好，不能满足资源调查的需要，影响了煤矿工业基本建设工作的进展。该局领导方面为了解决这个问题，决心学习苏联的“快速钻进法”。开始，他们向钻探队传达苏联专家关于苏联钻探新成就的报告，动员大家学习苏联的“快速钻进法”，遇到某些工人的保守思想的抵抗。他们说：“什么快速钻进，转那么快，不把转杆拧断啦”，“我干了十多年也没有听说有这样的钻探法”。该局领导方面为了纠正工人这种错误的认识，在进行了一般的动员号召之后，立即实行具体指导。他们派出党、行政、工会、青年团的干部，结合技术人员，深入现场，培养典型小组，以便推动一般小组。他们对马文志小组进行了深入的思想教育，详细介绍这一先进经验，充分准备各种应用器材，全力支持信心不足的工友。有的工友说：“钻那么快，钻机坏了怎么办？”领导干部说：“坏了由领导方面负责。”在施工过程中，领导干部和技术人员亲自到达现场，和工人共同改进管理方法和技术，帮助工人解决各种具体困难。马文志小组很快学会了“快速钻进法”，钻探效率从日进三公尺提到十公尺多，比一般小组的效率提高两倍多，同时减少了事故。但是，马文志小组的“快速钻进法”，一时还不能顺利推广出去。许多钻探工人认为这是偶然的成功，一部分落后工人甚至发生了忌妒心理。该局领导方面没有被这些阻力所动摇。他们总结了马文志小组学习先进经验成功的经验，在工人中进行深入的宣传教育，同时组织了参观、表演，举行了奖励大会，奖励马文志小组。这些实际教育，提高了工人的觉悟水平，部分工人开始接受这一先进经验。该局为了巩固推广工作的成绩，又以马文志小组为首，组成流动小组，协助解决其他组试行“快速钻进法”时所遇到的困难。这样，推广工作逐渐开展了，钻探工作获得显著的成绩。该局今年一月份仅完成钻探任务百分之七十三，三月份即提到百分之九十七，四月以后，又提到百分之一百零七。
    机械工业管理局推广苏联的“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的经验，也是一个很好的例子。某厂过去的生产，由于组织和管理不好，常常发生前松后紧，忽松忽紧，生产能力不能充分发挥，因而不能完成任务的现象。该厂的主要产品，只能完成计划百分之五十三，并且质量低劣，成本很高。苏联专家别列金同志曾经提议建立生产指示图表，以便消除这种生产无节奏的现象。但是，这一建议，该厂没有很好实行。去年机械工业管理局指示该厂学习苏联这一先进经验。该厂新任厂长沙平并不懂得技术，但是她有学习苏联先进生产经验的精神，有依靠群众办好企业的信心。她首先组织厂里的科、股长和车间干部，共同阅读“按指示图表组织有节奏的工作”一书，研究如何把苏联的先进生产经验运用到自己的厂里来。当时有一部分干部对于苏联这一先进生产经验不感兴趣。总务科干部认为要进行这一工作，需要化费上亿元印图表，这就等于浪费。财务科干部认为进行这一工作后，要增加许多储备量，影响资金周转。车间干部认为实行这种办法后，作业要划出进度，实在麻烦。沙平和其他党、行政、工会、青年团干部为了克服这些思想障碍，继续发动干部深入学习“按指示图表组织有节奏的工作”一书，并领导大家讨论实行这一先进生产经验对于改进企业管理的重大作用，一边学习，一边根据学习的心得试作各种指示图表。大家逐渐懂得了按指示图表工作，就可以使工作作到有条有理，比过去缺乏组织性和计划性的作业要好得多。但是，某些工人对于实行这一先进生产经验，还有若干顾虑。由于过去领导方面订的作业计划不周到，经常要更改，有些工人不相信可以实行按指示图表作业。另外有些工人知道实行按指示图表作业后，就要实行劳动专业化，就要调整组织，重新分配大伙干的活；而分配的新活，如果自己不熟练，就要少得工资。他们不赞成实行按指示图表作业。为了消除这些思想顾虑，领导方面首先向工人说明，实行按指示图表作业，即使完不成计划，也不随便改变计划。同时向工人说明实行劳动分工专业化的意义，这对于提高工人技术水平，提高生产，在这一基础上逐步改善职工生活，都有决定性的作用。这就提高了工人的认识，消除了工人的思想顾虑。当职工普遍认识了“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”这一先进经验的优越性后，该厂便发动职工展开红旗竞赛运动，通过这一运动，使职工发挥了劳动热情，把落后的生产单位提高到先进的生产水平。这样，该厂逐渐实行了全厂范围的有节奏的均衡生产。在这一基础上，该厂的生产面貌焕然一新。产量逐步提高，三月份产量比一月份提高一倍半，四月份接近提高两倍。今年全厂的生产能力将要提高两三倍。产品质量也逐渐改进，一月份消灭了三级品和不合格品。去年十一月前后没有一级品，今年第一季一级品上升到百分之四十，四月份上升到百分之六十七。该厂推广这一先进生产经验的经验证明，相信和重视苏联的先进生产经验，依靠群众，克服困难，加强思想教育工作，是做好推广先进生产经验工作的重要一环。
    但是，目前东北还有一部分工矿企业，没有作好推广先进生产经验的工作。例如，在纺织工业系统，有些工厂的领导干部还不大注意推广先进生产经验。他们满足于现有的生产成绩，不仅认为群众的创造“没有什么了不起”，就是对于成熟的先进生产经验，也没有认真地加以推广。有一部分工厂推广郝建秀工作方法时，没有对职工进行耐心的教育，也不培养典型，进行示范，而是草率地进行全面推广，结果影响了推广工作的开展。煤矿工业系统，创造了崔国山的快速掘进法，马文志小组的快速钻进法，竖井平行作业法等先进生产经验。煤矿管理局等领导单位虽然作出了决定，发布了指示，召开了动员会议，号召各个矿山积极学习和推广这些先进经验，但是在指示和动员之后，缺乏具体的领导
    （特别是缺乏负责制），推广工作形成自流状态。因此这些先进生产经验，目前还限于点的推广，谈不到面的推广。在机械工业系统，有些单位对于推广高速切削法是不重视的。机械工业管理局曾组织一个推广队到各厂协助推广高速切削法。但对该队缺乏具体的指导和必要的帮助，推广人员的技术水平也不能满足各厂的需要。有些工厂的工人积极要求实行高速切削法，但缺乏足够的刀具，领导方面没有给以支持和帮助。这些，都影响了推广工作的开展。目前机械工业管理局所属工厂真正实行高速切削法的机床，尚不够普遍（如沈阳市的工厂就有百分之三十以上的机床尚未采用高速切削法）。“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验，已引起一些企业领导干部的重视，但还有不少的企业领导干部，对于这一先进经验认识不足。有的人错误地把这一先进生产经验与普通的先进生产经验同等看待，认为“推广不推广没有什么了不起”。有的人则以“本厂条件不足”或“不适合于本厂情况”为词，拒绝推广这一先进生产经验。由于存在这些错误的认识，目前这一先进生产经验除了在少数工厂已推广外，在大部分工厂尚未推广起来。
    推广先进生产经验是实现增产节约计划的基本方法。没有做好推广先进生产经验工作的单位，必须从思想上深刻认识推广先进经验的重要意义，虚心学习苏联的先进经验，重视群众创造的各种先进经验，贯彻执行高岗同志的“有领导有组织地推广先进生产经验”的指示。
