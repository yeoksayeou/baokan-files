    Danube-Black Sea Canal
    On May 26, 1949, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party issued a decision on transforming nature – building the Danube-Black Sea Canal. The Romanian people celebrated this event as a major victory for the peaceful democratic camp.
    The construction of the Danube-Black Sea Canal is the largest project in Romanian history. It plays a significant role in the development of the Romanian economy. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej once pointed out: "The canal is extremely important for the improvement of our entire national economy and transportation. Moreover, tens of thousands of hectares of land will become suitable for cultivation, new towns and ports will be established, and the poor, backward Dobruja region will be industrialized."
    The Danube-Black Sea Canal is approximately 60 kilometers long and ranges in width from 160 meters to 180 meters. It starts from the town of Cernavodă, where the Danube River makes a northward turn in the southeastern corner of Romania, and extends to Constanța, a major port on the Black Sea coast to the east. The Dobruja region, through which the Danube-Black Sea Canal will flow, is characterized by an arid climate, barren soil, and numerous swamps, making it a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It is the poorest and most backward region in Romania. In the past, thousands of residents died of malaria every year. However, after the canal is completed in 1955, the face of Dobruja will be completely changed. A large amount of land that was previously unsuitable for cultivation will benefit from irrigation, 100,000 hectares (approximately 1.5 million mu) of wasteland will be transformed into fertile fields, and windbreaks will be planted on 150,000 hectares of land to block the hot air currents from the Black Sea. More importantly, several new industrial cities will be built along the banks of the canal, leading to the rapid economic development of the Dobruja region.
    The construction of the Danube-Black Sea Canal has been underway for more than three years. In the canal construction area, which spans dozens of kilometers, the Romanian people are working diligently and joyfully. Hundreds of huge excavators of various types are digging up large chunks of earth and transporting them to distant locations. Each machine can replace the labor of more than 300 people. During the project, Romanian workers, for the first time, applied the experience of the workers who built the Volga-Don Canal in the Soviet Union, using powerful high-pressure water jets to impact the soil and excavate the riverbed. When encountering rocks, they used explosives to blast them open. Thanks to the Soviet Union's supply of many riverbed excavation machines, 85 percent of the excavation work is now mechanized.
    The high degree of mechanization in canal excavation and the enthusiastic labor of the Romanian workers have greatly improved work efficiency, thus accelerating the progress of the project. In 1952, the amount of earth excavated will increase by 63 times compared to 1949, while labor productivity will increase by 452 percent.
    Anyone who has been to the Dobruja region before will be amazed to see the situation here today. Today, countless gardens have been opened up on the original muddy swamps, new railways have been laid, and where there were once scattered villages, there are now rows of new, modern residential areas; cars are speeding along shiny asphalt roads.
    The face of Medgidia, located at the midpoint of the canal, has also changed. New cement plants and huge machine manufacturing plants have been established there, employing thousands of workers. As a railway junction and canal port, Medgidia is about to become the administrative, industrial, commercial, and transportation center of the Dobruja region.
    The entire Danube-Black Sea Canal project area has now become a huge school. Many previously unskilled workers have learned various technologies here. In the past, the number of workers driving huge excavators was very limited in Romania, but now there are hundreds of such workers. In the past year, more than 5,600 skilled workers of various types have been trained here.
    The lives of the canal area builders are pleasant and rich. There are many libraries here (with a total collection of 140,000 volumes), three cinemas and five film projection teams, and many radio broadcasting stations. The workers' demand for and interest in culture and art are very extensive. In addition to a newspaper with a large circulation, there are also many wall newspapers. Two thousand workers participate in amateur art groups. Forty-seven choirs, dance troupes, drama groups, and ten symphony orchestras, organized by the workers themselves, often perform for their comrades on holidays.
    Currently, the construction of the Danube-Black Sea Canal is progressing rapidly. When it is completed in 1955, the voyage from the Danube to the Black Sea will be shortened by 240 kilometers. In this way, transportation costs can be greatly reduced, and transportation and trade between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union will be greatly facilitated.

### 多瑙河——黑海运河

    多瑙河——黑海运河
    一九四九年五月二十六日，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局发布关于改造自然的决定——兴建多瑙河——黑海运河。罗马尼亚全国人民当时把这件事情当作和平民主阵营的重大胜利来庆祝。
    兴建多瑙河——黑海运河是罗马尼亚历史上规模最大的工程。这对罗马尼亚经济的发展有着很大的作用。乔治乌—德治同志曾经这样指出过：“运河对于我国整个国民经济与运输的改善，都是极为重要的。并且，成千成万公顷的土地将变得适于耕种，新的城镇与港口将要建立，而贫困、落后的多布鲁查州也将工业化起来。”
    多瑙河——黑海运河全长约六十公里，宽度自一百六十公尺至一百八十公尺。它自多瑙河在罗马尼亚东南角向北拐湾的黑水镇起始，直至东濒黑海的要港康斯坦萨。多瑙河——黑海运河将要流经的多布鲁查州，气候干旱、地质贫瘠，又多沼泽，蚊虫最易繁殖，是罗马尼亚最贫困落后的地区。这里的居民过去每年因患疟疾死去的就有数千人。但是在运河于一九五五年建造完成以后，多布鲁查的面貌就要完全改变了。从前不能耕种的大量土地，将可获得灌溉的便利，十万公顷（约合一百五十万市亩）的荒地将要变为良田，十五万公顷的土地上将要种植起防风林带，以便阻挡自黑海来的热流。而更重要的是，沿着这条运河两岸的地区，将要兴建起几个新的工业城市，使得多布鲁查州的经济获得迅速的发展。
    多瑙河——黑海运河的兴建工程现已进行了三年多了。在纵横数十公里的运河工程地带，罗马尼亚人民正在紧张愉快地劳动着。成百部巨大的各式各样的挖掘机，把大块泥土从地里挖掘起来，运往远处。每一部机器能够顶三百人以上的劳动。在工程中，罗马尼亚工人第一次运用了苏联伏尔加—顿运河建设工人们的经验，用强有力的高压水柱来冲击泥土，开凿河床。在碰到岩石的时候，他们就用炸药来炸开它。由于苏联供给了许多开凿河床的机器，现在挖掘工作已有百分之八十五是机械化了。
    运河开凿工作的高度机械化和罗马尼亚工人的热情劳动，大大地提高了工作效率，因而加速了工程的进行。一九五二年的挖土量将比一九四九年增加六十三倍，而劳动生产率则将提高百分之四百五十二。
    任何一个以前到过多布鲁查州的人，现在再来看一下这里的情形将会感到惊奇。今天，在原来泥泞的沼泽地上已经开辟了无数花园，铺设了新的铁道，从前是稀落村舍的地方现在是成排的新的现代化的住宅区；闪闪发光的柏油公路上奔驰着汽车。
    位于运河中点的米奇迪亚城的面貌也已改变了。那里已经建立起新的水泥厂，巨大的机器制造厂，成千的工人在那里工作着。作为铁路交叉点和运河港口的米奇迪亚即将成为多布鲁查州的行政、工业、贸易和交通的中心。
    整个多瑙河——黑海运河工程地区现在已变成了一个巨大的学校。许多原来不熟练的工人在这里学会了各种各样的技术。从前驾驶巨大挖掘机的工人在罗马尼亚是屈指可数的，而现在这种工人已有数百名了。在过去一年内，这里培养出了五千六百多名的各种熟练工人。
    运河区建设者的生活是愉快而丰富的。这里有许多图书馆（它们藏书的总数达到十四万卷），三个电影院和五个电影放映队，许多无线电广播站。工人们对于文化、艺术的需求和兴趣是十分广泛的。这里除了有一张销数很大的报纸外，还有许多墙报。两千个工人参加了业余艺术小组。由工人们自己组织的四十七个合唱团、舞蹈团、戏剧小组和十个交响乐队，常常在节日为他们的同伴演奏。
    现在，多瑙河——黑海运河的建设工程正在迅速进行。当它在一九五五年完成以后，多瑙河至黑海的航程将可缩短二百四十公里。这样，运输成本就可大大减低，人民民主国家和苏联之间的运输和贸易也将得到很大的便利。
