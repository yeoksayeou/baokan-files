    Activist Meetings are a Good Way to Conduct Communist Education
    Editor: We have used activist meetings to educate Party members and activists among the masses about communism, the Communist Party, organization, and production development, and have gained a lot.
    This activist meeting lasted for three days, with a total of 295 activists participating and attending. After the responsible comrade gave a political report and the congress held discussions, everyone had a deeper understanding of communism, the Communist Party, and the direction of rural development. For example, Hu Changju, a member of the Communist Youth League, originally thought that communism meant collectivizing all the property of the village and eating from the "big pot," which worried him greatly. Now that he understands what a communist society is, he actively participates in mutual aid group production. Zang Zehua, another member of the Communist Youth League, now correctly recognizes that the Communist Party is the party of the working class and acknowledges that the working class is the leading class. In particular, after listening to the report on the direction of rural development, many comrades criticized their own selfish ideas. For example, Wang Jinsan, the security committee member, said: "After I divided the land, I didn't want to work anymore, and as a result, the landlord took advantage of the opportunity, released the field water, damaged the crops, and the peasants suffered. Now I realize that we must work actively and earnestly organize the peasants in order to gradually move towards a communist society." Everyone put forward their own direction of effort for the future. Party members expressed that they would examine their own thoughts and actions according to the eight criteria for Party members and transform themselves. League members expressed that they would study the eight criteria for Party members and strive to join the Party. Six of the seven League members in Ge Village have applied to join the Party, and all eleven League members in Yinkoushan Village 2 have requested to join the Party.

    积极分子会议是进行共产主义教育的良好方式
    编辑同志：我们用召开积极分子会议的方式，对党员和群众中的积极分子进行了关于共产主义、共产党和组织起来、发展生产的教育，收获很大。
    这个积极分子会议共开了三天，参加和列席会议的活动分子共二百九十五人。在负责同志作了政治报告和大会进行了讨论以后，大家对共产主义、共产党和农村的发展方向都有了更深刻的认识。例如：团员胡昌举原来认为共产主义是全村一切财产大归公，吃大锅饭，为此很发愁。现在弄清楚了什么是共产主义社会，就积极参加互助组生产。团员臧泽华现在正确认识了共产党是工人阶级的政党，承认了工人阶级是领导阶级。特别是在听了关于农村发展方向的报告后，许多同志纷纷批判了自己的自私自利思想。如治安委员王金三说：“我分了田后就不再想工作了，结果让地主钻了空子，放了田水，坏了田禾，农民吃了亏。现在我认识到必须积极工作，认真把农民组织起来，才能逐步走向共产主义社会。”大家都提出了自己今后努力的方向。党员表示要根据党员标准的八项条件检查自己的思想、行动，改造自己。团员表示要好好学习党员标准的八项条件，争取入党。戈村七个团员中已有六个人申请入党，银山口二村的十一个团员都要求入党。
