Strengthening Urban-Rural Ties in the Current Stage of Socialist Construction
Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

Our Party faces particularly important and immensely responsible tasks today. The stage we are currently in is a stage of decisive significance for the victorious realization of our Six-Year Plan. This stage of Poland's industrialization and economic revival, the stage of developing Poland's productive forces on the basis of modern technology—as stipulated in the Six-Year Plan—in itself contains many extremely important and difficult issues.

Editor's Note: The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party was held in Warsaw from June 14th to 15th. Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting titled "Strengthening Urban-Rural Ties in the Current Stage of Socialist Construction," providing a profound analysis of the socio-economic transformations that have occurred in the Polish countryside since liberation, defining the Polish Party's rural policy for the current stage, and the Party's organizational tasks. This newspaper published an abstract of the report on July 17th. Now, we reprint the full text as follows:

What are these issues?

First, in terms related to the current international situation, the decisive issue is to further consolidate the strength of our People's State as a factor in defending peace and our national independence.

The second category of issues concerns the results of our implementation of the National Economic Plan, our shortcomings and weaknesses, and the many important tasks in this regard. Mobilizing the Party to complete these tasks will enable us to overcome numerous difficulties and accelerate the realization of our Six-Year Plan.

In the current stage of our socialist construction, another extremely important issue is the issue of urban-rural economic ties. The further we advance, the more this issue requires our attention. Today, it is particularly necessary for the Party to focus on this issue when comprehensively analyzing our economy and its further development.

In this respect, from the perspective of examining the complex tasks we currently face, the fundamental organizational-political issue is to strengthen the Party, to raise the Party's level of leadership in the struggle of the urban and rural working people. In accordance with the instructions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the Polish working people are conducting this struggle on the basis of a broad national front, with the goal of ensuring peace and realizing the historically significant tasks of the Six-Year Plan. This national front, led by the working class vanguard—the Party—unites millions of working peasants in a strong alliance. The Party's leading role, its improved leadership over the working masses, its ability to unite the masses, its prestige among the working masses, and its ties with them—these are the factors that determine the fighting strength and scale of action of the national front in the struggle for peace and the realization of the Six-Year Plan. The current international and domestic situation, as well as the urgent political and economic tasks, require us to intensify the struggle against the treacherous and criminal conspiracies of reactionaries, imperialist agents, and enemies of the working people, and to intensify the struggle against capitalist elements and capitalist remnants in the minds of the masses. Intensifying the political struggle requires, first and foremost, strengthening leadership, consolidating Party organizations, and expanding the activities of Party organizations.

We are now entering the stage where the parliament is to approve the Constitution of the Polish Republic. The next stage will be the election of a new parliament and People's Councils. This means that we are about to enter a stage of universally mobilizing the masses. The Central Committee Plenary Session must profoundly analyze how well our Party has prepared for these tasks, and what work should still be done in order to complete them.

We still have many serious shortcomings, weaknesses, and difficulties; of course, our path is not entirely smooth, and not every task of ours is easy; we face many things that require attention and immensely responsible tasks.

But we can say with certainty that Poland is no longer a poor, defenseless, and helpless country; those are things of the past. Those who want to take advantage of our weaknesses, despite gnashing their teeth at us like beasts, have had their hopes dashed. The Hitlerite remnants and their imperialist masters who rant like madmen about wanting to seize our territories of the Oder and Neisse rivers are merely wasting their breath. September 1939 is gone forever. The shame of our past helplessness in the face of aggressors is gone forever. The dreams of those who attempt to sell out the treasures of the Polish people, those who shamelessly flatter and fawn on warmongers, and attempt to infiltrate Poland for espionage and subversion, of the traitors and exiles, have also been dashed. More than one of them has already paid for such activities with their bought head, which is the inevitable fate of all traitors sooner or later. The working masses will never allow anyone to snatch power from their hands again. They have learned to defend their own interests and the interests of the country in an appropriate manner. The Polish workers, with their diligent labor, can create all the best means to ensure the indestructible strength of the people and the integrity of their victorious fruits, ensuring the wealth of the country. The constantly increasing consciousness of the Polish working masses is a guarantee of this.

Socialist Industry and New Tasks in Industrial Leadership

We have been engaged in the Six-Year Plan for nearly two years. What achievements have we made in these two years?

In the first two years of the Six-Year Plan (1950-51) and this year, the production volume of our socialist industry has increased, and is continuing to increase, at a rate far exceeding the provisions of the Six-Year Plan.

This can be clearly seen from the following figures:

The percentages of the value of socialist industrial production compared to 1949 are as follows:
Year	Six-Year Plan Target	Actual Completion
1949	100	100
1950	122	130.8
1951	147.3	162.7
1952	171.1	199 (This is according to the 1952 plan)

If the 1952 plan is completed, the production volume of socialist industry this year will be almost double that of 1949, while the Six-Year Plan stipulates that 1952 should only be 71.1 percent higher than 1949.

Thus, thanks to the selfless labor of our working class and the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, we have greatly exceeded the socialist industrial production level stipulated in the Six-Year Plan for 1953 after utilizing the reserves of our economy.

In this past period, the work of Poland's socialist industrialization has been carried out on a solid foundation, because the increase in the production of means of production has exceeded the increase in the production of consumer goods, which is the only way to ensure the steady progress of industrialization.

The achievements of this past period were achieved after a struggle against many serious difficulties. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to achieve these achievements. It is impossible to not encounter difficulties in realizing such a huge and profound change that we are now undertaking. The difficulties encountered by our developing socialist industry in carrying out arduous tasks in 1952 are greater than in previous years. This is because our tasks this year are also more arduous and burdensome than the tasks of the entire previous stage of development. But it is not just a matter of new, more arduous, and more burdensome tasks. The basic reason why we are now encountering difficulties and obstacles is that the conditions of industrial development have changed, and the newly arising situation requires us to change our working methods and requires us to have new leadership methods.

The Soviet Union also experienced a similar situation during the period of the First Five-Year Plan. At that time, Comrade Stalin, in his speech "New Situation and New Tasks of Economic Construction" at the Conference of Economic Workers on June 23, 1931, pointed out the methods and means to overcome difficulties in developing socialist construction and the path to learn new working methods in the new situation. The points pointed out by Comrade Stalin at that time have great significance and are very relevant to the current stage of development in our country.

We must:

(1) Systematically absorb manpower to participate in various enterprises;

(2) Develop comprehensive mechanization;

(3) Vigorously expand the work of improving the technology of our workers, especially young workers;

(4) Abolish the petty-bourgeois wage egalitarianism, strengthen the concern for the material conditions of the workers, and gradually and steadily eliminate the causes of fluctuating labor morale;

(5) Put the issue of fully utilizing production capacity on the agenda and solve it;

(6) Raise the supply of raw materials and auxiliary materials to the proper level
—raise it to the level of a far-sighted and flexible plan, and eliminate the outdated methods and unplanned situations in this area;

(7) Fully recognize the fact that the situation of cadres in industry has changed and is constantly improving; stop empty talk about the lack of cadres; quickly strengthen and establish a leading core in our enterprises to cope with the difficult tasks of the current stage.

If our Party can vigorously complete these tasks, we will be able to eliminate many of the obstacles we are currently encountering and ensure the realization of the great tasks of the Six-Year Plan.

Agriculture and the Issue of Urban-Rural Ties

Since liberation, many socio-economic changes have taken place in the Polish countryside; the formulation of the Party's policy in the countryside is based on a profound analysis of these changes. The changes in the Polish countryside are profound and dramatic. These changes are in stark contrast to those that occurred before the war. The characteristic of the past was the declining status of the grassroots peasant masses, who were increasingly heading towards ruin. But today, the material well-being and living standards in the countryside are undoubtedly constantly improving. Social and political activities in the countryside are also increasing, and the general cultural level is also rising.

The industrialization of Poland and the realization of the Six-Year Plan have consolidated and expanded these victories of the peasant masses. The planned economy resulting from the public ownership of the means of production in the main sectors of the national economy has also greatly influenced the lives and work of the peasant masses.

However, it must be clearly remembered that the current economic structure in the countryside is different from that of industry or other sectors of the national economy. The further we advance on the road to realizing our socialist construction plan, the more the various backward rural economic structures relying on small-scale individual production methods hinder the proper improvement of the level of agricultural production, and the more the national economy's demand for agricultural products and the development of agricultural production become disproportionate. In other words, the rate of increase in agricultural production is now far behind the needs of the national economy. The following figures can prove this.

Taking the total value of industrial and agricultural production in 1949 as 100, the rates of increase are as follows:
1949	1950	1951	1952	1955
(Plan)	(Plan)
Socialist Industry	100	131	162	199	258
Agriculture	100	111	106	115	150

This comparison clearly illustrates the disparity between the speed of industrial and agricultural development.

Currently, small-scale individual farming is a widespread phenomenon in agriculture. Urban-rural ties can only be built on the basis of commodity exchange. Every agricultural household is more or less a commodity economy. And from an economic point of view, what is the significance of a commodity economy? It is an economy that, regardless of the will of the people, is subject to the objective economic laws of commodity circulation. This objective economic law is the law of value. Under the capitalist system, the law of value always creates two groups in society: the impoverished masses and a small handful of capitalist swindlers.

In the current situation, that is, in a situation where the basic means of production have been nationalized, and where there is socialist industry based on a planned economy on the one hand, and a vast number of individual, small-scale agricultural households in agriculture on the other, how does the law of value manifest itself and play a role in our country?

The relationship between these two different economic systems—the socialist economy and the small commodity economy—is based on commodity exchange, which is carried out through money and the market, by means of buying and selling, that is, by maintaining relationships based on the law of value. However, although the law of value still has a huge influence on urban-rural relations, it is no longer the master of the overall socio-economic relations, because the overall socio-economic relations have been fundamentally changed due to the fact that the basic and main sectors of the national economy have become social property. The socialization of the means of production has created new economic conditions that are completely opposite to the capitalist economic conditions. The new economic conditions have produced new economic laws. The implementation of these new objective economic laws, which dominate social life under the new conditions, will, to a large extent, subject the national economy to the control of the state plan. Therefore, the law of value, which previously operated spontaneously in capitalist production and was accompanied by the laws of competition and anarchy, has now been strictly restricted. However, restriction does not mean elimination.

In our economic system, socialist industry is a factor that determines the continuous and rapid development of our entire national economy, and it and all the products it produces are the property of the people. Therefore, the basic economic law of socialism is to satisfy the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the people to an ever-greater extent. This goal is in line with the task of planned development of the national economy and is in line with the task of continuously raising and improving socialist production on the basis of modern technology.

What is the direction of development of the economic laws produced by private ownership of the means of production? Its direction of development is to disintegrate the producers, to completely disintegrate them, for example, the individual peasant economy is an example. In the capitalist economy, they develop in the direction of expanding class contradictions
(which is unavoidable under the capitalist system), and at the same time in the direction of fierce competition between capitalist groups, which leads to plunder and war.

The economic laws produced by public ownership and the public ownership system do not develop in the direction of disintegration and division of society, but in the direction of unifying society. In the process of production, it unites the working masses who constitute the majority of the social population. The actual production process is carried out on the basis of a unified economic plan, which includes all public enterprises and all nationalized means of production. The state planned economy also influences other economies to a considerable extent, determining the general conditions of urban-rural economic ties.

So, what are the main tasks of our economic plan at the present stage? What is the next task of our plan?

As can be seen from the Soviet Union's rich experience in socialist construction over the years, the task of our plan is first to develop a socialist economy that can ensure that it does not become a vassal of the capitalist world and imperialist expansionist policies, because economic independence is a prerequisite for political independence, and we must protect it like the apple of our eye.

Devoting ourselves to consolidating our economic and political independence, preventing all the conspiracies of the imperialists, devoting ourselves to strengthening our security and defense capabilities, and devoting ourselves to our significant contribution to the cause of peace—this remains the main task of our policy.

The second task is to ensure that we have unified control over the socialist economy, to restrict and eliminate capitalist elements, to completely eliminate them, and to eliminate all sources that breed capitalism, so that its tentacles will no longer extend. Therefore, the task in agriculture is to patiently, firmly, and skillfully transform the small commodity economy into a socialist economy by developing production cooperatives.

There was a period in the history of our Party when the capitulationist-opportunists under the banner of Gomulka, under the pressure of the forces of hostile classes and their ideology, in order to permanently preserve the small commodity economy, to shelter the rich peasants, and to try to restore capitalism in Poland and abolish all the victories of the working class, took actions against our Party's line and against the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

The Gomulka line was exposed and shattered. This fact proves that our Party is well-tempered and that its ideological strength is powerful, although today we must never relax our vigilance and must firmly oppose all opportunistic manifestations caused by the pressure of rich peasant ideology on our ranks.

The third task of our plan is to determine the correct proportions in the development of the national economy. We must remember that, especially during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, as long as there is a danger generated by imperialism, as long as there are hostile classes and the dangers they generate, and before the socialist economy has achieved complete dominance in our country, determining the proportions in economic development must first aim at realizing the above two tasks.
Strengthening the Regulatory Role of the State in Urban-Rural Material Exchange

The difficulties we are now facing—difficulties that we can and will overcome victoriously—are, as everyone knows, rooted in one of the following: the excessive imbalance between the speed of development of our socialist industry and the speed of development of agriculture.

The excessive imbalance in agriculture threatens to cause serious dislocations in the entire national economy, and this imbalance, because it directly affects the relations between different economic structures—between the socialist economy and the small commodity economy—directly undermines the economic ties between the working class and the peasants, making its danger all the greater.

Due to the damage caused by drought and the reduction in the supply of agricultural products, the excessive imbalance in agriculture worsened last autumn, which made it more difficult to supply the needs of the working class. Affected by frenzied profiteering and hostile rumors, the prices of agricultural products sold on the open market rose significantly, which damaged the income of the working class, while greatly increasing the income of wealthy peasants. Therefore, in the countryside, which is particularly related to national industrialization, not only is there no contribution to an appropriate and necessary degree of socialist accumulation, but on the contrary, a portion of the income of the working class flows into the countryside, and this money, after arriving in the countryside, mainly flows into the pockets of the rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants who control the most surplus goods, and another part flows into the pockets of urban capitalists, so these people become active again and start making fortunes.

This forced the Party to take many measures, such as partially regulating prices and setting commercial prices. The state's shipment volume has increased, the contract system has been greatly expanded, and the work of the trade network has also been improved. All these measures are aimed at eliminating abnormal situations in urban-rural material exchange.

We will also follow all these principles in the future, while adhering to the principle of strengthening the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance, and adhering to the principle of consolidating the position of the working class in the struggle against bourgeois elements.

The main and final purpose of our political and economic struggle against the capitalist elements in urban and rural areas—a struggle that we must launch in conjunction with the main laboring peasant masses—is to eliminate the bourgeoisie and eliminate all exploitation of the working people in urban and rural areas. The only way to achieve this goal is to carry out socialist construction not only in the cities but also in the countryside.

Even at present, we must spare no effort to do everything we can to fight for the continuous increase of agricultural products—whether in the socialist economic sector or in the small commodity economic sector—in order to eliminate the unusual imbalance between industrial products and agricultural products. It is absurd and suicidal to lower the rate of our industrialization.

Is there really a possibility for accelerated development of agricultural products? Is there really a possibility for greatly increasing agricultural output?

Undoubtedly, such a possibility does exist, but so far we have not properly utilized it.

In the past three years alone, the proportion of output from the socialist sector in the total output of agriculture has increased from 6 percent to 16 percent. But many facts show that the rate of increase can be greatly improved. For example, from the second half of 1951 to the beginning of 1952, the number of agricultural production cooperatives basically remained unchanged—around 3,000. It was not until this spring that it increased by about 300 cooperatives. Although the cooperatives have been further greatly consolidated during this period, the quantitative increase has been more or less stagnant. What is the reason for this? The reason is that the Party organizations in the countryside have turned to other movements and have not paid attention to the propaganda and organizational activities for the development of production cooperatives.

Some comrades believe that peasant cooperatives can develop automatically or can be developed with the help of administrative measures and pressure from higher levels; but at the same time, the Central Committee has not approved the use of administrative pressure, is unwilling to wait patiently for its spontaneous process, and is unwilling to allow any aspect of the Party's work to have spontaneity. This fact may be the reason why the work of establishing cooperatives in the countryside has stagnated. This issue is different from some movement, this is the most important and very difficult task, this task is of the most significant meaning—to transform the countryside into a socialist countryside, to create the main prerequisites for the country to develop along the socialist road.

According to the plan, the number of state-owned machinery and tractor stations must be increased to 335 by the end of this year (there were 283 in April this year), and these agricultural machinery and tractor stations must become the decisive factor in the development of the socialist sector in agriculture. Our industry must undertake the task of supplying agriculture with an increasing number of better agricultural machinery and tractors. The 35,000 tractors currently under the control of agriculture (calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor) constitute a very powerful technical foundation, which can and must be rapidly developed. The speed of development of the socialist sector in agriculture largely depends on the correct organization of the work of the state-owned machinery and tractor stations.

The Party committees at all levels must change their attitude as soon as possible: not only change their attitude towards leading the work of the state-owned machinery and tractor stations, but also change their attitude towards leading the work of the state-owned farms.

The achievements made by the advanced state-owned farms led by cadres loyal to the Party and the people's regime not only prove the great economic significance of the socialist large farms, but also prove its great educational significance. If all state-owned farms are raised to the level of the best state-owned farms, they will constitute a strong socialist production base, which will guarantee the supply of large quantities of agricultural products to the country; for millions of laboring peasants, this will become a model of modern agriculture and help them participate in large-scale collective farming, thereby accelerating the social transformation of the countryside.

But while we redouble our efforts to develop and improve the organizations of socialist agriculture, we should not forget for a moment that the small commodity individual economy of millions of peasant masses is a central issue in urban-rural economic ties now and for a long time to come. Anyone who does not understand and underestimates the role of the small commodity economy in our country's economic life cannot understand and will inevitably underestimate the main problems in the current stage of our country's development. Consolidating the alliance with the basic laboring peasant masses—this is the main task of our rural policy.

As everyone knows, the middle peasants are the backbone of the current countryside; their material conditions have been continuously improved under the people's regime. The rich peasants try their best to win over the middle peasants, especially the upper strata among them, and try to entice them to form an alliance with bourgeois elements. At the same time, the working class offers the middle peasants a different prospect: that is, to unite and unite all those who have severed ties with capitalism, who are not retreating but advancing—towards socialism, that is, towards the universal happiness of all laboring people in urban and rural areas—in order to develop.

This is the essence and significance of the current stage of the class struggle; the essence and significance of the worker-peasant alliance; that is, the essence and significance of the struggle currently being waged in the economic and political fields; this struggle, in the rural areas, simply put, is a struggle by the working class relying on the poor peasants to fully win over the middle peasants to the side of the working class, to win them over to participate in the socialist construction work together with all the laboring people in urban and rural areas.

The only way to win the laboring peasants to the side of socialism is to use the following methods: use a wise economic policy; treat them with a fraternal attitude; treat them as allies in every step; and most importantly, unite with them to fight to eradicate the exploitation and deception of the rich peasants; and resolutely fight against speculators and the remnants of the bourgeoisie, who try to plunder or live a parasitic life—relying on the labor and efforts of industrial workers, peasants, and staff members.

This issue is an issue of ensuring that the sales channels of socialist agriculture are expanded as soon as possible, and that the sales channels of small and middle peasants are also expanded at the same time, with the aim of making us less and less dependent on the surplus goods of the rich peasant economy, and of course, our economy must also make full use of these things at the same time. We must show special concern for the small and poor peasants.

On the basis of expanding the state's planned assistance and on the basis of the increasingly widespread use by laboring peasants of the technical assistance provided by state-owned machinery and tractor stations in the countryside, peasant economies have every possibility of increasing their productivity.

Until now, our selfless and heroic working class has shouldered the main burden of national industrialization. If we can work more skillfully, combatively, and actively in the countryside, taking into account the needs of the peasant masses, and more actively mobilizing millions of peasant masses, raising their awareness, to participate in socialist construction, we can infinitely increase and accelerate our achievements in national industrialization, accelerate the speed of development of our productive forces and defense capabilities, and therefore accelerate the development of the universal material and cultural well-being of our people. If we can, through skillful policies, that is, correct, flexible, and profound economic policies in all aspects, and the implementation of these policies in urban-rural material exchange makes it impossible for bourgeois elements to play tricks, engage in profiteering activities, act as intermediaries and hoarders of consumer goods—if we can do this, then we will be able to greatly reduce our difficulties in supplying and strengthening the state's regulatory role and urban-rural economic ties.

Organizational Tasks of the Party

Our country is a country of the people's democratic system, which is the decisive factor in the great social transformation currently taking place in our country. The people's state, as the main factor in the Polish working class's execution of its revolutionary historical tasks, is playing the main role of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the Party's main responsibility and fundamental task is to unite all laboring people and constantly strive to consolidate the strength and power of our people's state.

The draft Constitution of the Polish Republic, which has been approved by the basic masses in the process of mass discussion, is a factor of great significance for the development of our country; it is a reflection of the highest stage of development reached by our country.

The draft People's Constitution has received such enthusiastic and heartfelt support from the laboring masses because its principles, its socio-political essence, and its legal essence are different from those of the bourgeois constitution, it is based on the solid foundation of economic and socio-political transformations that have already been realized in our country. The foundation and principles of the new Constitution are not hanging in the air, nor are they merely declarations and wishes, but are based on the solid and indestructible foundation of the new economy. The social ownership of the means of production and the planned national economy based on this are the essence of this new economy. The new Constitution clearly reflects the great historical process of our country's transformation into a new socialist country. This explains why the People's Constitution has become a strong fortress of the broad national front; the slogan of this national front is: to fight for peace; to realize industrialization, to apply new technologies, to fight for the increasingly rapid development of our country's productive forces; to fight for the consolidation and expansion of the achievements of the Constitution.

The increasing activity of the laboring masses in production, social, cultural, and political life, and in all movements, is a powerful and decisive driving force for all our achievements, and at the same time, it is the most valuable and correct criterion for proving the approval of the Party's policies by the people, and for proving the correctness of the Party's instructions and slogans. However, the masses' trust and approval of the Party's policies and slogans not only gives the Party every right to be proud of the work it has done, but also places a great responsibility on the Party to the masses. The trust of the people requires the Party to, first of all, tirelessly strive to strengthen the Party's ties with the masses, strengthen the leadership of the masses' daily work, and help them overcome concrete difficulties.

If we estimate our work from this point of view, we must admit that there are still many serious weaknesses and shortcomings in our work that must be quickly overcome. In order to complete the increasingly important and responsible tasks I mentioned above, we must launch a tenacious and resolute struggle to overcome the deviations that still manifest themselves in the work of many Party organizations.

The most dangerous of these is bureaucracy, which is a major obstacle to work and the main source of weakness in Party organizations. What is bureaucracy in the work of Party organizations? It is a tendency for Party leaders and cadres to evade supervision from below, to evade criticism, and to become detached from the masses. It is a tendency to ignore the principles of democracy within the Party, to separate high-level Party organs from Party organizations, and it is a tendency for leading organs to lose regular and systematic organizational contact with the masses of Party members. Issuing orders from on high, leading entirely from the desk or by issuing circulars, and the phenomenon of Party organizations becoming detached from the non-Party masses all arise from this. Comrade Stalin said: Bureaucracy is a manifestation of the influence of the bourgeoisie on our organizations. In many links of our state organs and our mass organizations, there are also manifestations of bureaucracy.

The basic task of our Party is to make our state organs have a socialist nature, otherwise the state organs will be corroded by bureaucracy, become detached from the laboring masses and their supervision, and easily become an obstacle and resistance to socialist construction.

However, where does the main danger come from? It is like this: the Party must ensure that the state organs overcome bureaucratic working methods, otherwise, the state organs will in turn influence the Party and make the Party infected with the disease of bureaucracy.

If the Party organs are under the influence of bureaucracy, and they themselves become bureaucratic, no longer becoming a fighting educational organization that guides the entire daily life and struggle of the laboring people, but becoming some kind of upper, middle, and lower-level yamen system, what will be the result? The result is that some Party cadres who are not well-tempered will also become detached from the masses, and some Party members will become infected with bad habits; instead of waging a resolute struggle against high-handed habits, favoritism, sectarianism, alcoholism, and depravity, they themselves will become infected with these bad habits and become a medium for spreading the ideological influence of class enemies unconsciously.

Currently, the Party is victoriously purging its ranks, clearing out those who are not ideologically conscious, who joined the Party because of some misunderstanding or for the purpose of achieving goals contrary to the Party's tasks. Many Party organizations have not fully understood and adhered to Lenin's great principles regarding Party development and Party composition for a period. Those who joined the Party during this period are also being cleared out.

Clearing out hostile elements and those who joined the Party by chance, those who are influenced by the petty-bourgeois environment, bureaucracy, and corruption, is an extremely important and urgent task. But while the Party is purifying itself, it should also be concerned with developing the Party and appropriately adjusting its social composition. In this light, the most urgent organizational task is to wage a resolute struggle against all kinds of bureaucrats, and first of all to wage a struggle against all manifestations of bureaucracy in the Party organs and Party organizations at all levels.

Criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the fighting capacity of Party organizations at all levels through criticism and self-criticism, strictly abiding by the principles of democracy within the Party, Party organizations being responsible for and concerned about every Party member and probationary member, and assigning tasks to every Party member without exception—all of these must become weapons in this struggle.

Criticism and self-criticism are tried and true weapons that can ensure the fighting spirit of the Party's ranks and ensure the correctness of the Party's leadership in all aspects of its work. Only opportunists, bureaucrats, and sectarianists are afraid of criticism, try every possible way to evade criticism, and use all means to suppress criticism. The emotions of fear of criticism and the cancellation attitude towards self-criticism shown by some comrades are the most obvious signs of the danger of deviations, indicating that something is wrong, and all Party members of the Party organization need to pay attention and conduct the most strict supervision.

We must conduct and organize criticism and supervision by the grassroots masses more boldly and actively regarding the activities of the state, economic, trade union, and other organs, whether led by Party members or non-Party members. This means that we need to unite non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals, educate them to learn to criticize and supervise, and cultivate this habit. Comrade Stalin taught us: "The reason why communists are powerful is because they are good at uniting millions of non-Party activists around our Party."

Is there any need to prove how urgent and significant these words are for our Party? Especially for the countryside, where the development of Party organizations is completely disproportionate to the conditions under which they can actually develop; where there are still many so-called "blank spots"—that is, there are still many villages with no Party organizations at all; where the supervision and leadership of Party organs are very rare; where sectarianism, the use of personal connections, and disorganized and undisciplined phenomena have not been properly countered; where the level of Party life is still very low. The number of peasant and agricultural worker Party members is only 192,000, accounting for 17 percent of the total number of Party members, while Party members who are staff members account for 20 percent. Among the 350,000 people employed in state-owned farms and state-owned tractor stations, the number of Party members is 40,000.

What is the reason for this situation? Some state and county committees are not paying close attention to the organizational work and mass political work of Party organizations in the countryside.

What conclusions should be drawn from the above situation? It is that we must call on Party committees, Party organizations, and all Party activists to step up their work and strive to improve the level of organizational work and leadership methods of all Party organizations and organs from top to bottom. In order to victoriously complete the more important and complex new tasks I have mentioned today, and to live up to these new tasks, we must first improve the fighting spirit of all our Party organizations, activate them, and establish closer ties with the laboring masses.

We must always remember that the Party is a powerful force that leads the work of millions of people and educates millions of laboring masses to live a new life, transforming their ideology; the Party realizes its leadership and transformative role in the daily struggle, in the sharp and irreconcilable struggle against the remnants of capitalism and against the traditions and habits instilled in the masses by the old ideas of the bourgeoisie. What we communists use to deal with the moral degradation of the bourgeoisie is the tempering of our ideology, the spirit of revolutionary combat, the boundless loyalty to the cause of the proletariat, and the profound selflessness and patriotism in the struggle to realize the new social system, to strive for the happy future of our country, and to strive for the continuous creative progress of mankind. If a communist Party member does not control his behavior and emotions from the perspective of revolutionary proletarian morality, he will easily fall into the mire of bourgeois habits and be unable to extricate himself. But Party organizations are responsible for every Party member. Party members must give all their strength, all their enthusiasm, and their entire life to the Party. If a Party organization does not check and evaluate every Party member, is indifferent to him, and allows him to wallow in anything, then this Party organization cannot be considered a Bolshevik organization.

Our Party has made great achievements not only in the political, economic, and educational fields, but also in the organizational work field, and it is certainly a serious mistake to fail to see this. Without diligent organizational work, it is impossible to achieve any success in any aspect. The various achievements of our rich social life in almost every aspect at present, and they are great achievements, are all due to our Party.

The Party, relying on the Polish Youth League and trade unions, has become the initiator and leader in the socialist competition in industry, transportation, communications, construction, agriculture, etc., that is to say, the Party is the leader of this movement which has become a huge driving force for the realization of our Six-Year Plan—our country's socialist construction. In the first quarter of this year, 3.86 million workers participated in the socialist competition, accounting for 75 percent of the laboring people in these national economic sectors. The difference between this year's competition and previous years is that more and more engineers, technicians, scientific workers, and other intellectuals are also starting to participate in this movement. The work of promoting new working methods and new competition methods is being carried out on a large scale; the rationalization movement has been increasingly widely launched among the laboring youth—including members and non-members of the Polish Youth League.

    加强社会主义建设现阶段中的城乡联系
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席  贝鲁特
    我们党今天面临着特别重要与责任巨大的任务。我们今天所处的阶段对胜利实现我国六年计划是具有决定意义的阶段。这个波兰工业化和经济复兴的阶段，在现代技术的基础上发展波兰的生产力的阶段——像六年计划规定的那样——本身就包含着许多极为重要而且困难的问题。
    编者按：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议于六月十四日至十五日在华沙举行。波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特在会上作了“加强社会主义建设现阶段中的城乡联系”的报告，对于波兰解放后农村中所发生的社会经济变革作了深刻的分析，确定了波兰党目前阶段的农村政策和党的组织任务。本报七月十七日发表了这个报告的摘要，现在将全文转载如下：
    这些问题是什么呢？
    首先，在与目前国际形式有关的方面，决定性的问题是进一步巩固我们人民国家的力量，作为保卫和平与我国独立的一个因素。
    第二类问题是关于我们执行国民经济计划的结果、我们的缺点和弱点，以及在这方面的许多重要任务。动员党来完成这些任务，将使得我们能够克服许许多多的困难并加速我国六年计划的实现。
    在我国社会主义建设现阶段中，还有一个极为重要的问题就是城乡经济联系的问题。我们愈前进，这个问题就愈需要我们予以更大的注意。今天特别要求党在总的分析我国经济及其进一步发展的时候集中注意这个问题。
    在这一方面，从我们要研究一下目前我们面临的全盘复杂任务这一观点来看，这个基本的组织——政治问题就是加强党的问题，提高党在城乡劳动人民的斗争中的领导水平问题。波兰劳动人民遵照中央委员会第六次全体会议的指示，正在一个广泛的全国阵线的基础上进行这个斗争，目标 是确保和平与实现有历史意义的六年计划的任务。这个全国阵线以工人阶级的先锋队——党为首，用坚强的联盟团结了好几百万劳动农民群众。党的领导作用，它对劳动群众的改进了的领导，它的团结群众的能力，它在劳动群众中的威信和与他们的联系——这些都是决定全国阵线在争取和平与实现六年计划的斗争中的战斗力量与行动规模的因素。目前国际和国内的形势以及迫切的政治和经济任务，需要我们加紧对反动派、帝国主义特务、劳动人民的敌人的无信义的和罪恶的阴谋进行斗争，加紧对群众思想中的资本主义成分与资本主义残余进行斗争。要加紧政治斗争首先需要加强领导，巩固党组织，扩大党组织的活动。
    我们现在正将进入议会要批准波兰共和国宪法的阶段。下一个阶段便是选举新议会和人民委员会。这意味着我们即将进入一个普遍发动群众的阶段。中央委员会全体会议必须深刻地分析：我们党为了完成这些任务，准备工作做得怎么样了，而且为了完成这些任务，还应该做些什么工作。
    我们仍然有许多严重的缺点、弱点和困难；当然，我们的道路并不是十分平坦的，我们的每一项工作都不是轻松的；我们面前有着许多需要注意的事情和责任重大的任务。
    但是我们能够肯定地说：波兰已不是贫困的，没有防御的，没有办法的国家了；这些都是过去的情形了。那些想利用我们的弱点的人们，尽管像野兽似地对我们咬牙切齿，但是他们的希望落空了。那些像疯子一样叫嚷着想侵夺我国奥得河和尼斯河的领土的希特勒主义余孽以及他们的帝国主义主子不过是白费气力而已。一九三九年九月已一去不复返了。我国过去在侵略者前面毫无办法的耻辱已一去不复返了。那些企图出卖波兰人民的宝藏，那些无耻地向战争贩子献媚讨好，企图潜入波兰进行间谍与颠覆活动的卖国分子和流亡分子的梦想也落空了。他们之中已不止一个因为这种活动而付出了他的被收买的头颅，这迟早是所有叛徒们的必然的命运。劳动群众决不再允许任何人把政权从他们手中抢走。他们已学会以适当的方式保卫他们自己的利益和国家的利益。波兰工人以他们的辛勤的劳动能够创造一切最好的手段来确保人民的不可摧毁的力量和他们的胜利果实的完整，确保国家的财富。波兰劳动群众的觉悟不断提高是这方面的保证。
    社会主义工业与工业领导方面
    的新任务
    我们从事六年计划，将近两年了。在这两年来我们获得了些什么成就呢？
    在六年计划的头两年（一九五○——五一）中和今年，我国社会主义工业的生产量增加了，并且在继续增加中，其增加的速度远超过六年计划的规定。
    从下面的数字可以清楚地看出这一点：
    与一九四九年比较，社会主义工业生产量价值的百分比如下：年份    六年计划的规定    实际完成额一九四九    一○○    一○○一九五○    一二二    一三○·八一九五一    一四七·三    一六二·七一九五二    一七一·一    一九九（这是依照一九五二年的计划）
    如果一九五二年计划完成了，今年社会主义工业的生产量差不多等于一九四九年的两倍，而六年计划规定一九五二年只比一九四九年增加百分之七十一点一。
    这样，由于我国工人阶级忘我的劳动和苏联的全面援助，我们在利用了我国经济的后备力量后，已大大地超过了六年计划所规定的一九五三年社会主义工业的生产水平。
    在过去这个时期内，波兰社会主义工业化的工作是在稳固的基础上进行的，因为生产手段的生产量的增加超过了消费品生产量的增加，这是确保工业化稳步进行的唯一办法。
    过去这个时期的成就是在对许多严重困难进行了斗争后才取得的。否则就不可能取得这些成就。要实现我们现在所进行的这样巨大这样深刻的变化，是不可能不遭遇困难的。我国发展中的社会主义工业在一九五二年执行艰巨任务时所遇到的困难，比以前几年都大。这是由于今年我们的任务也比以前发展的整个阶段的任务都更为艰巨和繁重。但这不仅是一个新的，更艰巨的，更繁重的任务问题。我们现在所以碰到困难和障碍，基本原因是工业发展的条件已经改变了，新产生的情况需要我们改变工作方法，需要我们有新的领导方法。
    苏联在第一个五年计划时期也有过类似的情况。当时斯大林同志在一九三一年六月二十三日经济工作人员代表会议上发表的“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”的演说中，指出了在发展社会主义建设中克服困难的方法和手段，在新的情况下学习新的工作方法的道路。斯大林同志在那个时期所指出的几点，对我国现阶段的发展，有着巨大的意义，而且是很符合及时的需要的。
    我们必须：
    （一）有组织地吸收人力参加各企业；
    （二）发展全面的机械化；
    （三）大规模展开提高我国工人，特别是青工的技术的工作；
    （四）取消小资产阶级的工资平均制度，加强对工人物质条件的关怀，来逐步地、稳步地消灭劳动情绪忽冷忽热的原因；
    （五）把充分利用生产能力的问题提到日程上来并加以解决；
    （六）提高原料与辅助物资的供应到应有的水平
    ——提高到一个目光远大的、灵活的计划的水平，并消除这一方面的陈旧方法和漫无计划的情形；
    （七）充分认识这样一个事实：工业中干部情况已有改变，而且正在不断地改善；停止空口叫嚷缺乏干部；在我国各企业中迅速加强和建立一个领导核心来应付现阶段的困难任务。
    如果我们党能够大力完成这些任务，我们便能够消除目前所碰到的许多障碍，确保六年计划伟大任务的实现。
    农业和城乡联系问题
    自从解放以来，波兰农村的社会—经济已发生了许多变化；制订党在农村中的政策的根据就是对这些变化作深刻的分析。波兰农村的变化是深刻而剧烈的。这些变化和战前发生的那些变化恰恰相反。昔日的特点是基层农民群众的地位日益降低，他们日益趋于毁灭。但是，今天，农村中的物质幸福和生活水准无疑地正在不断改善。农村中的社会政治活动也在增加，一般文化水平也在提高。
    波兰的工业化和六年计划的实现，巩固并扩大了农民群众的这些胜利果实。因国民经济中主要部门的生产手段的公有制而产生的计划经济，也大大地影响了农民群众的生活和工作。
    然而，必须清清楚楚地记住：目前农村中的经济结构与工业或国民经济的其他部门不同。我们在实现我们的社会主义建设计划的道路上愈向前进，依靠小规模的个体生产方法的各种落后的乡村经济结构，就越来越妨害农业生产水平有适当的提高，并且使国民经济对农业产品的需求和农业生产的发展两者越来越不相称。换句话说，农业生产增加的速度现在已经远远落后于国民经济的需要。下列数字可以证明这一点。
    以一九四九年工业和农业生产总值各为一百计算，增加的速率如下：
             1949    1950    1951    1952    1955
                     （计划）（计划）
    社会主义工业    100    131    162    199    258
    农业    100    111    106    115    150 
    这个比较，清楚地说明了工业和农业发展的速度之间的悬殊。
    目前在农业中的小规模的个体耕作是普遍的现象。城乡联系只能建筑在商品交换的基础上。每个农业家庭或多或少地都是商品经济。而从经济意义上讲，商品经济是什么意义呢？它是一种不管人民的意志如何，要受商品流通的客观经济法则支配的一种经济。这种客观经济法则就是价值法则。在资本主义制度下，价值法则永远是在社会上制造出两个集团，一个是贫苦大众，另一个是一小撮资本主义骗子。
    在目前的情况下，就是说，在基本生产手段已经国有化的情况下，在一方面有以计划经济为基础的社会主义工业，另一方面在农业中同时存在着广大个体的、小规模农业家庭的情况下，价值法则怎样在我国表现出来并在我国起作用呢？
    这两种不同的经济制度——社会主义经济和小商品经济——之间的关系是以商品交换为基础的，这种商品交换是借货币与市场作媒介，以买卖的方式，即借助于保持以价值法则为基础的关系进行的。但是，价值法则虽然在城乡关系上仍然有着巨大影响，可是它已经不再是总的社会经济关系的支配者，因为，由于国民经济中的基本的主要部门已经成为社会财产，因而总的社会经济关系已经根本改变了。生产手段的社会化创造了与资本主义经济条件完全相反的新的经济条件。新的经济条件就产生了新的经济法则。实行在新的条件下支配着社会生活的这些新的客观经济法则，结果在很大程度上就会使国民经济受到国家计划的支配。因此，以前在资本主义生产中自发的起作用并伴以竞争法则与无政府状态的价值法则，现在已经受到了严格的限制。不过，限制并不等于消灭。
    在我们的经济制度中，社会主义工业是这样一种因素：它确定我们整个国民经济的不断的迅速发展，它和它所生产的全部产品是人民的财产。因此，社会主义的基本经济法则是在越来越大的程度上满足人民日益增加的物质与文化要求。这个目的是符合有计划地发展国民经济的任务的，是符合在现代技术的基础上不断提高并改进社会主义生产的任务的。
    由生产手段私有制产生的经济法则，它的发展方向是什么呢？它的发展方向是分解生产者，是把他们完全分解开来，例如，个体农民经济就是一个例证。在资本主义经济中，它们向着扩大阶级矛盾
    （这是资本主义制度下无法避免的）的方向发展，同时向着资本家集团之间的激烈竞争的方向发展，这种竞争就导向掠夺和战争。
    由公有财产和公有制产生的经济法则不向分解、分裂社会的方向发展，而是向统一社会的方向发展。在生产过程中，它把占社会人口大多数的劳动群众团结起来。实际的生产过程是在统一的经济计划的基础上进行的，这种统一的经济计划包括着一切公有企业，一切国有化生产手段。国家计划经济在相当大的程度上也影响着其他经济，确定城乡经济联系的总的条件。
    那么，我们的经济计划现阶段的主要任务是什么呢？我们的计划的下一个任务是什么呢？
    从苏联的多年来丰富的社会主义建设经验可以看出，我们的计划的任务首先在于发展社会主义经济，这种经济可以保证自己不致沦为资本主义世界、和帝国主义扩张政策的附庸，因为经济独立是政治独立的先决条件，我们必须像保护眼珠一样地保护它。
    致力于巩固我们的经济与政治独立自主，防范帝国主义者的一切阴谋，致力于加强我们的安全与国防力，致力于我们对拥护和平的重大贡献——这仍然是我们政策的主要任务。
    第二个任务是保证我们对社会主义经济有统一的控制，限制并排除资本主义成分，把它们完全消灭，消灭一切滋生资本主义的来源，这样它的触角就不会再伸出来了。因此，在农业方面的任务就是用发展生产合作社的方法耐心地、坚定不移地、熟练地把小商品经济转变为社会主义经济。
    在我党的生命史上曾经有过这样一个时期，当时在哥穆尔卡的旗帜下的投降——机会主义分子，在敌对阶级的力量及其思想意识的压力下，为了永久保存小商品经济、庇护富农、设法在波兰恢复资本主义、取消工人阶级的一切胜利果实，而采取了反对我党路线、反对马克思—列宁主义原则的行动。
    哥穆尔卡路线被揭露了，粉碎了。这个事实证明了我党是久经锻炼的，它的思想力量是强大的，虽然今天我们绝不可放松警惕，并且必须坚定不移地反对因富农思想对我们队伍的压力而产生的一切机会主义的表现。
    我们计划的第三个任务是确定发展国民经济中的正确比例。我们必须记住：特别是在自资本主义过渡到社会主义的时期内，只要存在着由帝国主义产生的危险，只要存在着敌对阶级和由它们产生的危险，在社会主义经济在我国还没有取得完全的支配地位之前，确定经济发展中的比例，必须首先以实现上述两个任务为目的。加强国家在城乡物资交流中的
    调节作用
    我们现在所面临的困难——这种困难我们能够，并将胜利地加以克服——大家都知道，其根源之一就是：我们的社会主义工业发展速度和农业发展速度之间存在着过度不均衡现象。
    农业中的过度不均衡现象有使整个国民经济发生严重脱节之虑，这种不均衡现象，由于直接地影响到不同经济结构之间——社会主义经济与小商品经济之间——的关系，直接地破坏了工人阶级与农民之间的经济联系，其危险也就愈大。
    由于旱灾为害，农产品的供应削减，农业中的过度不均衡现象在去年秋天益见恶化，这种现象使供应工人阶级需要方面困难更多。受了疯狂谋利和敌意谣言的影响，在公开市场上出售的农产品的价格上涨了许多，这使得工人阶级的收入受到损害，而富有农民的收入却大大地增加。因此，在和国家工业化有特别利害关系的农村，非但是对于适当的、必要程度的社会主义积累无所贡献，相反的工人阶级的一部分收入却流入了农村，而这些钱到了农村以后，主要流入了掌握最多过剩物资的富农和富有中农的腰包，另一部分流到了都市资本家的口袋里，因而这些人又活跃起来，开始发财了。
    这使得党不得不采取许多措施，诸如部分规定物价，订立商业价格等。国家发货额增加了，合同制度大大地扩大了，贸易网工作也改善了。所有这些措施目的都是要消除城乡物资交流中的不正常情况。
    我们将来也将遵循所有这些原则，同时还要坚持加强工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用的原则，坚持在反对资产阶级分子的斗争中巩固工人阶级地位的原则。
    我们的反对城乡的资本主义成分的政治的和经济的斗争——我们必须联合主要的劳动农民群众来展开这一斗争——的主要的和最后的目的是：消灭资产阶级，消灭城市中和乡村中对劳动人民的一切剥削。要达到这个目的，唯一的道路就是不仅是在城市里，同时也在农村进行社会主义建设。
    即使是在目前，我们也必须不遗余力地竭尽我们的一切可能，来为农产品的不断增加——不论是在社会主义经济部分，或是小商品经济部分——而斗争，以消灭工业产品和农产品之间异乎寻常的不均衡现象。降低我们工业化的速率是荒谬的、自杀的办法。
    农产品真有加速发展的可能吗？农产品真有大大提高产量的可能吗？
    无疑的，的确存在这种可能性，只是迄今为止，我们还没有适当地加以利用罢了。
    单在过去这三年里面，在农业的全部产量中，社会主义部分的产量所占比例自百分之六增加到了百分之十六。但有许多事实说明，增加的速率还能极大地提高。譬如说，自一九五一年下半年到一九五二年年初，农业生产合作社的数目基本上没有改变——三千左右。到了今年春天，才增加了约三百个合作社。虽然在这个时期里面，合作社有了进一步的大大巩固，而数量上的增加或多或少是处于静止状态的。这是什么原因呢？原因就在于：农村里的党的组织转向了其它的运动，没有关心发展生产合作社的宣传和组织活动。
    某些同志认为农民合作社能够自动发展，或者能在行政措施的帮助下，上级的压力下发展；而同时呢，中央委员会并没有批准使用行政压力，不愿耐心等待其自发过程，也不愿让党的工作的任何方面存在着自发现象。这个事实可能就是农村中合作社建社工作所以停滞不前的原因。这个问题不同于某种运动，这是一个最重要，同时又是任务非常艰巨的问题，这个任务是有最重大的意义的——把农村转变为社会主义的农村，为国家沿着社会主义道路发展创造主要的先决条件。
    按照计划，国营机械和拖拉机站的数目到今年年底必须增加到三百三十五个（今年四月为二百八十三个），这种农业机械和拖拉机站必须成为农业中社会主义部分的发展的决定性因素。我们的工业必须担当起这个任务：供应农业以日益增加的更精良的农业机械和拖拉机。目前交由农业支配的三万五千架拖拉机（以每架十五匹马力计算）构成了非常有力的技术基础，这个基础能够，而且必须迅速地予以发展。农业中社会主义部分的发展速度在很大程度上取决于正确地组织国营机械和拖拉机站的工作。
    党的各级委员会必须尽速改变态度：不仅是改变对于领导国营机械和拖拉机站工作的态度，也要改变领导国营农场工作的态度。
    由忠于党和人民政权的干部领导的先进国营农场所获得的成绩，既证明了社会主义大农场的巨大经济意义，也证明了它的巨大的教育意义。假如所有国营农场都提高到了最优秀的国营农场的水平，它们就会构成一个强大的社会主义生产基础，这个基础将保证为国家供应大量的农产品；对于千百万劳动农民，这将成为现代化农业的模范，并帮助他们参加大规模集体耕作，从而加速农村的社会转变。
    但是，在我们加倍努力，以求发展并改善农业社会主义化的组织的时候，不应该有一时一刻忘记了千百万农民群众的小商品个体经济，在现在和将来的很长一个时期内，是城乡经济联系中的一个中心问题。任何不了解和过低估计小商品经济在我国经济生活中的作用的人，都不能了解并必然会低估我国发展的当前阶段中的主要问题。巩固与基本劳动农民群众的联盟——这就是我们的农村政策的主要任务。
    如大家所知道的，中农是目前农村里的中坚人物；他们的物质条件在人民政权下不断改善。富农尽力在争取中农，特别是他们中的上层人物，力图引诱他们和资产阶级分子结成联盟。同时，工人阶级提供给中农一个不同的前景：就是团结、联合所有那些已经和资本主义斩断关系，不是后退而是前进——走向社会主义，也就是说，走向城市和农村的所有劳动人民的普遍幸福——的人，以求发展的前景。
    这就是阶级斗争现阶段的本质和意义；工农联盟的本质和意义；也就是目前正在经济和政治方面进行的斗争的本质和意义；这种斗争，在农村方面，简单说来，就是工人阶级依靠贫农为完全争取中农到工人阶级这边来，争取他们和全体城乡劳动人民共同参加社会主义建设工作的斗争。
    要争取劳动农民到社会主义这一边来只有用下述方法：利用明智的经济政策；对他们采取兄弟般的态度；每一个步骤都把他们当做盟友来对待；最重要的是与他们联合起来，进行斗争，以根除富农的剥削和欺骗；并坚决地和投机商人与资产阶级的残余作斗争，这些人试图进行掠夺，或是过寄生虫生活——靠产业工人、农民和职员的劳动和努力为生。
     这个问题是一个保证社会主义农业的销路尽速扩大，小农和中农的销路也同时扩大的问题，其目的在使我们对于富农经济的过剩商品的依赖越来越少，当然，我们的经济同时还要充分地利用这些东西。对于小农和贫农，我们必须表示特别关心。
    在扩大国家的有计划的援助的基础上，在劳动农民越来越广泛地利用国营机械和拖拉机站在农村中提供的技术帮助的基础上，农民经济是有一切可能提高其生产率的。
    到现在为止，我们的忘我的、英勇的工人阶级承担了国家工业化的主要负担。假如我们能够在农村中干练地、战斗地、更积极地工作，考虑到农民大众的需要，而更积极地发动千百万农民大众，提高他们的觉悟，来参加社会主义建设的话，我们就能无限量地增加并加速我们在国家工业化方面的成就，加速我们的生产力和防御力量的发展速度，因此，也就是加速我国人民普遍的物质和文化福利的发展。假如我们借着干练的政策，也就是在各方面的正确的、灵活的、深刻的经济政策，而这种政策的实行在城乡物资交流方面就使得资产阶级分子没有可能玩弄花样，从事谋利活动，作消费品的买卖居间人和囤积者——假如能这样的话，那末，我们将能大大地减少我们在供应与加强国家的调节作用和城乡经济联系方面的困难。
    党的组织任务
    我们的国家是人民民主制度的国家，这是目前正在我国进行的伟大的社会改造的决定性因素。人民的国家，作为波兰工人阶级执行革命的历史任务的主要因素，正在起着无产阶级专政的主要作用。因此，党的主要责任与基本任务就是把全体劳动人民团结起来，经常地为巩固我们人民国家的力量与威力而努力。
    在群众性的讨论过程中获得了基本群众的批准的波兰共和国宪法草案，对于我们国家的发展是一个意义重大的因素；它是我们国家发展达到了最高阶段的反映。
    人民宪法草案受到了劳动群众那样热情的衷心拥护，这是因为它的原则、它的社会—政治本质与法律本质都和资产阶级宪法不一样，它是建立在已经在我国实现了的经济改造与社会—政治改造的坚固基础之上的。新宪法的基础与原则并不是悬在空中的，也不只是宣言与愿望，而是建立在新经济的坚固的、不可摧毁的基础之上的。生产手段的社会所有制以及以这为基础的计划国民经济就是这种新经济的本质。新宪法明确地反映了我们的国家转变为社会主义新国家的伟大历史过程。这就说明了为什么人民宪法会成为广泛的全国阵线的强有力的堡垒；这个全国阵线的口号是：为和平而斗争；实现工业化，应用新技术，为越来越迅速地发展我国的生产力而斗争；为巩固与扩大宪法的成果而斗争。
    劳动群众在生产、社会、文化与政治生活中以及在一切运动中的积极性已日益高涨，这是我们所取得的一切成就的强有力的、有决定性作用的推动力，同时，也是说明人民群众批准党的政策的最可贵最正确的准则，说明党的指示与口号的正确性的准则。但是，群众信任与批准党的政策与党的口号，不仅仅是使党有一切权利为它所完成的工作而自豪，而且也使党对群众负起了重大的责任。人民群众的信任要求党首先要不倦地努力加强党与群众的联系，加强对群众日常工作的领导，帮助他们克服具体的困难。
    如果我们从这个观点来估计我们的工作，我们就必须承认工作中还存在着许多严重的弱点和缺点而必须迅速加以克服。为了完成我上面所说的越来越多的责任重大的工作，我们必须展开顽强的、坚决的斗争，克服仍然表现在许多党组织的工作中的偏向。
    其中最危险的是官僚主义，它是工作的大障碍，是党组织中的弱点的主要根源。什么是党组织的工作中的官僚主义呢？它是一种党的领导者与干部逃避从下而上的监督、逃避批评的倾向，是一种脱离群众的倾向。这是忽视党内民主的原则，使高级的党机关脱离党组织的倾向，是一种领导机关与党员群众失去经常的、有系统的组织联系的倾向。高高在上的发号施令、完全从办公桌上或靠发通令实行领导、以及党组织脱离非党群众的现象都会从此产生。斯大林同志说：官僚主义是资产阶级对我们组织的影响的一种表现。在我们的国家机构和我们的群众团体机构的不少环节上，也有官僚主义的表现。
    我们党的基本任务是使我们的国家机构具有社会主义的性质，不然国家机构就会为官僚主义所侵蚀，脱离劳动群众和他们的监督，很容易变成社会主义建设的障碍和阻力。
    然而，主要的危险是从哪里来的呢？是这样：党一定要保证国家机构克服官僚主义的工作方法，不然，国家机构反过来就会影响党，使党染上官僚主义的病症。
    如果党的机构在官僚主义的影响之下，自己也染上了官僚主义，不再成其为一个指导劳动人民整个日常生活与斗争的战斗的教育组织，而变成了某种上、中、下级衙门系统的话，结果会怎样呢？结果是一部分锻炼不够的党的干部也会脱离群众，一部分党员会染上坏习惯；不是与高高在上的习惯、偏私、闹宗派、酗酒与堕落作坚决的斗争，而是自己也染上这些恶习，变成了传播阶级敌人的思想影响的媒介而不自觉。
    目前党正在胜利地清洗自己的队伍，把那些思想上没有觉悟的、因为某种误解或者为了达到与党的任务相反的目的而参加党的人清除出去。许多党组织有一个时期没有充分了解与遵守列宁关于党的发展与党的成分的伟大原则。在这个时期参加党的人也在被清除中。
    把敌对分子与因偶然的机会而入党的分子、受到小资产阶级环境、官僚主义和腐化堕落的影响的分子清除出党，是一个极为重要而又迫切的任务。但是党在纯洁它自己的时候同时应当关心发展党与适当地调整它的社会成分。这样看来，最急迫的组织任务就是对各种各样的官僚主义者进行坚决的斗争，而首先就是对官僚主义在党的机关与各级党组织中的一切表现进行斗争。
    批评与自我批评、通过批评与自我批评加强各级党组织的战斗力、严格遵守党内民主的原则、党组织对每一个党员与候补党员负责并关心他们、毫无例外地给每一个党员规定任务——所有这一些必须成为这一斗争中的武器。
    批评与自我批评是屡试不爽的武器，它可以保证党的队伍的战斗性，保证党对自己各方面工作的领导的正确。只有投机分子、官僚主义者与宗派主义者才害怕批评，千方百计地逃避批评，并用尽一切手段压制批评。某些同志所表现的害怕批评的情绪与对自我批评的取消态度是有发生偏向的危险的最明显的迹象，这说明有什么事情出了毛病，党组织的所有党员都需要注意并加以最严格的监督。
    对于国家、经济、工会和其他机关的活动，不论它是党员还是非党员领导的，都必须更大胆更积极地开展和组织基层群众的批评和监督。这就是说，我们需要把非党工人、农民与知识分子团结起来，教育他们学会批评与监督，并养成这种习惯。斯大林同志教导我们说：“共产党员所以有力量，就是因为他们善于把千百万非党员积极分子团结在我们党周围。”
    这些话对于我们党来说，是多么急迫，多么意义重大，难道还用得着证明吗？特别是对于农村来说，在那里，党组织的发展与它们实际上可以发展的条件是完全不相称的；在那里，仍然有着许多的所谓“空白点”——这就是说仍有许多村庄根本没有党组织；在那里，党的机关的监督和领导是很罕见的；在那里，闹宗派、引用私人和无组织无纪律的现象还不曾受到适当的反击；在那里，党的生活水平还是非常低的。农民与农业工人党员人数只有十九万二千人，占党员总人数的百分之十七，而机关职员党员占百分之二十。在国营农场与国家机器拖拉机站所雇用的三十五万人中，党员的人数是四万人。
    造成这种情况的原因何在呢？某些州与县委员会对农村党组织的组织工作与群众政治工作是抓得不紧的。
    从上面这种情形看来，应当得出什么结论呢？就是必须号召党委员会、党组织和党的所有积极分子加紧工作，为提高自上而下的所有党组织与机关的组织工作水平与领导方法水平而努力。为了胜利地完成我今天所说的更重大更复杂的新任务，不辜负这些新任务，我们必须首先提高我们所有的党组织的战斗性，使它们积极起来，并与劳动群众建立更密切的联系。
    我们一定要经常地记住，党是一支强大的力量，它领导千百万人的工作，教育千百万的劳动群众去过新的生活，改造他们的思想意识；党是在日常的斗争中，在对资本主义残余、对于从资产阶级陈旧的思想灌输给群众的传统和习惯进行尖锐的不调和的斗争中，来实现它的领导与改造作用的。我们共产党员用以对付资产阶级的道德堕落的，是我们思想意识的锻炼，是战斗的革命的精神，是对无产阶级事业的无限忠诚，是在争取实现新社会制度、争取我们国家的幸福前途、争取人类不断的创造性的进步的斗争中的深刻的忘我精神与爱国主义。一个共产党员如果不从革命的无产阶级道德的观点来控制他的行为与感情，他就很容易陷入资产阶级习气的泥淖而不能自拔。但是党组织对于每一个党员是要负责的。党员必须把他所有的力量，他所有的热情以及他的全部生命交给党。党组织如果不去检查也不去估量每一个党员，对他漠不关心，而使党员沉溺在什么地方，那这个党组织就不能算是一个布尔什维克的组织。
    我们的党不仅在政治、经济和教育方面，而且在组织工作方面，都是有巨大的成绩的，看不到这一点当然是一个严重的错误。没有勤勉的组织工作，要在任何方面取得任何成绩都是不可能的。我们目前几乎包括任何方面的丰富的社会生活的种种成绩，而且是很大的成绩，都是要归功于我们党的。
    党依靠波兰青年联盟和工会，在工业、运输、交通、建设、农业等等部门中的社会主义竞赛中成为发起者与领导者，这就是说，党是这个已经成为实现我们六年计划——我国社会主义建设的巨大推动力的运动的领导者。在今年的第一季，参加社会主义竞赛的工人有三百八十六万人，占这些国民经济部门的劳动人民的百分之七十五。今年的竞赛与前几年不同之点，是越来越多的工程师、技术人员、科学工作者与其他脑力劳动者也开始在参加这个运动。推广新工作方法与新的竞赛方式的工作已在大规模地进行着；合理化运动已在劳动青年——包括波兰青年联盟的盟员与非盟员——日益广泛地展开了。为了庆祝定于七月举行的青年突击工作者大会，竞赛运动正在热情高涨的气氛中在青年中间发展着。
    但是列宁和斯大林告诫我们不可只看见成绩，并教导我们如何培养新力量，如何重新组织战斗的队伍去迎接新任务，如何克服越来越多的困难与障碍。只有经常保持组织的战斗状态，对机会主义的情绪、对在我们中间仍然有它的影响的自满与小资产阶级的自发性进行无情的斗争，这种任务才能胜利完成。
    同时，我们还必须更坚决更有力地来团结我们的力量，党的力量，以及我们的前途与真正的希望所系的战斗的忘我的青年的力量。为了实现我们的社会主义建设，我们必须更大胆地把千百万城乡劳动群众组织起来。我们当前的任务是胜利地完成目前六年计划中的第三年计划，这对于我们计划的继续胜利完成是有决定意义的。鼓舞着我们去斗争并开拓未来的道路的口号，是加强为和平与六年计划而斗争的全国战线。让千百万劳动人民群众团结起来进一步展开他们伟大的创造性的运动吧！让马克思—列宁主义的伟大学说与思想继续领导我们前进吧！更多地开动我们的脑筋，更坚强地锻炼我们的意志，更高地提起战斗的热情，在争取社会主义的斗争中，我们将勇敢地满怀信心地为我国人民铺好胜利的道路！（原载“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五一期）（附图片）
