The wheat harvest in North China began in late May in various regions, and has now been completed in all areas except those planting spring wheat. The wheat competition movement has also largely concluded. In Hebei Province, the average wheat yield per mu this year is 92 jin, an increase of 19 jin compared to last year (73 jin per mu), exceeding this year's planned target (81 jin per mu) by 11 jin. In Pingyuan Province, the average yield per mu this year is 98.7 jin, an increase of 27.2 jin compared to last year (71.5 jin per mu), exceeding this year's planned target (90 jin per mu) by 8.7 jin. Shanxi Province originally planned to produce 114 jin per mu, but due to various natural disasters, despite the vigorous efforts of the masses to salvage the crops, production was still reduced by 30% to 40%, with an average harvest of 85 jin per mu. Overall, the average harvest of wheat fields throughout the region is more than 94 jin per mu, an increase of 13.2 jin compared to the average harvest in 1951 (77.8 jin per mu), and an increase of 1.3 jin compared to the planned yield per mu for 1952 (89.7 jin).

Various regions conducted wheat competitions before and after the wheat harvest. Many high-yield units were discovered in the competition. Hebei has now discovered nine high-yield counties (yielding 120 to 220 jin per mu), seventeen high-yield villages (yielding 200 to 400 jin per mu), eighty-three high-yield mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives (yielding 300 to 500 jin per mu), and three thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight high-yield households (yielding 400 to 600 jin per mu, of which two thousand nine hundred and seventy households participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives). Du Yushan's irrigated wheat in Handan Prefecture yielded 800 jin per mu. Cui Wufeng's dryland wheat in Linqing yielded 689 jin per mu. In Huoshui Jiao Village, Shexian County, a mountainous area, more than 240 mu of wheat fields yielded 124.5 jin per mu last year, and 301 jin per mu this year. The state-run Hebei Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station planted 120 mu of wheat, with an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu. The 5,500 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland at the state-run Jiheng Farm yielded an average of 145.6 jin per mu, of which 200 mu yielded an average of 350 jin per mu. In Pingyuan Province, there were 22 counties with an average yield of more than 100 jin per mu, and 28 counties with an average yield of 80 to 100 jin per mu. According to partial statistics from 26 counties in the Xinxiang, Anyang, Huxi, and Puyang Prefectures, there were a total of 321 units with yields of more than 400 jin per mu, of which 58 units had yields of more than 600 to 800 jin per mu. Many regions broke historical records for the highest wheat yield. For example, in Guo Wangdu Village, Anyang, only one household had ever harvested 400 jin of wheat per mu in the past, but this year, twelve households harvested 400 to 600 jin of wheat per mu. The village's 1,210 mu of wheat fields yielded an average of 266 jin per mu (182 jin per mu last year). In Beizhouliu Village, Tangyin County (a disaster area), the average wheat yield per mu for the entire village was nearly 300 jin, of which Han Jindou's "Buddha's Hand" wheat yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu. Li Entong and other seven mutual aid teams in Wuzhi County yielded 416 jin per mu for irrigated wheat, 288 jin per mu for dryland, and 602 jin per mu for high-yield land. Li Entong's high-yield land yielded 912 jin per mu. In Yangzhuang, Yuanyang, one mu of barley yielded 1,400 jin. Although Shanxi suffered relatively severe disasters, many high-yield models also emerged. According to materials from only five counties in the Yuncheng Prefecture and parts of the Linfen Prefecture, there are already 280 high-yield wheat households (yielding 300 to 800 jin per mu for irrigated land and 200 to 500 jin per mu for dryland) and three high-yield model groups (yielding 400 to 450 jin per mu). Zhang De of Xiajiluo Village, Zhaocheng County, had 1.2 mu of high-yield land (irrigated), yielding 1,001 jin, an average of 834 jin per mu. Wei Mingbiao's agricultural production cooperative in Wuxiang County had 1.96 mu of high-yield land (dryland), yielding 774 jin per mu. The emergence of these high-yield models, especially the emergence of larger areas of high-yield units, has established a banner for high wheat yields in the future. This is the first victory in this year's large-scale patriotic production increase campaign in agricultural production.

In the wheat competition movement, it has been proven that "competition" is the most concrete, practical, and effective method of education for farmers.

1. In the "competition," many high-yield models were discovered, breaking the farmers' conservative idea of "production reaching the top" and establishing the concept of increasing yield per unit area. The broad masses of farmers generally paid attention to improving technology, processing and applying fertilizer, and vigorously investing in production. In the past, many farmers said: "It is difficult to harvest a hundred dan without planting a hundred mu." An old farmer in Wuzhi County, Pingyuan, said after visiting the high-yield land of a labor model: "I have been farming all my life and didn't know that the land had such great strength. This has really educated me." After the "competition" was conducted in various regions, the farmers' production enthusiasm greatly increased. In the fifth district of Daming County, Hebei, farmers plowed 25,345 mu of wheat land and delivered 189,150 carts of manure within three days after the "competition." Many farmers immediately made plans to increase agricultural implements and investment after the "competition." After the "competition" was implemented in Wuzhi County, Pingyuan, many farmers requested to participate in the technical committee of the farm. The farmers said: "The farm is a reliable support for farming." The relationship between state-run farms and farmers has become closer. In areas where the "competition" work has been done well, seed selection work has also been very successful. According to statistics from 2,230 villages in 44 counties in Hebei, more than 38.47 million jin of wheat seeds have been selected, laying the foundation for replacing superior varieties in 50% of the wheat fields this autumn.

2. In the "competition," the superiority of being organized was greatly demonstrated, further guiding farmers towards the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. The agricultural production cooperative in Housangquan Village, Daming County, Hebei, yielded an average of 135 to 150 jin of wheat per mu, the year-round mutual aid team yielded an average of 100 jin of wheat per mu, and the temporary mutual aid team yielded an average of 90 jin of wheat per mu. The Wang Xiaozong agricultural production cooperative in Beidi Village yielded an average of 138 jin of wheat per mu. The general mutual aid teams in this village yielded an average of 110 jin per mu, and the individual households yielded an average of 90 jin per mu. The Cheng Baifu agricultural production cooperative in Sangezhuang, Linxian County, Pingyuan (mountainous area), yielded an average of 200 jin per mu, the year-round mutual aid team Sang Laishan team yielded an average of 120 jin per mu, the temporary mutual aid team Sang Shizhu team yielded an average of 100 jin per mu, and the individual household Sang Lizhong yielded an average of 65 jin per mu. Many such examples have most powerfully educated the masses of farmers. After the "competition," mutual aid and cooperative organizations developed and improved rapidly. In Daming County, Hebei Province, 3,525 new mutual aid teams were developed during the "competition," and 3,210 temporary mutual aid teams were converted into year-round mutual aid teams. Through the "competition" in Raoyang County, 80% of farmers were organized.

3. After the "competition," the broad masses of people closely linked the production plans of households and teams with the interests of the country. From then on, they eliminated concerns about increasing burdens and fear of showing wealth. In the "competition" summary, farmers realized that farmers' high yields were the result of the government's strong economic and technical support, the development of mutual assistance and cooperation, and the mobilization and leadership of the patriotic production increase campaign. Only by relying on the leadership of the Party and the People's Government can a prosperous and fulfilling life be created. In the "competition," farmers specifically experienced the superiority of the new democratic system, greatly enhancing their political awareness and production enthusiasm.

    华北区各地小麦评比运动大部结束
    单位面积产量比去年提高一成以上
    广大农民在评比中受到了最实际的政治教育
    华北区各地从五月下旬先后开始收割小麦，至今除种植春麦的地区外已全部收完，小麦评比运动也大部结束。河北省今年每亩小麦平均产九十二斤，较去年（每亩产七十三斤）增加了十九斤，超过今年计划数（每亩产八十一斤）十一斤。平原省今年每亩平均产九十八点七斤，比去年（每亩产七十一斤半）增加了二十七点二斤，超过今年计划数（每亩产九十斤）八点七斤。山西省原计划每亩产一百一十四斤，由于遭受了各种自然灾害，虽经群众大力挽救，仍减产百分之三十至四十，平均每亩收获八十五斤。综观全局，全区麦田每亩平均收获九十四斤以上，比一九五一年每亩平均收获量（七十七点八斤）增加了十三点二斤，比一九五二年计划每亩产量（八十九点七斤）增加一点三斤。
    各地在麦收前后进行了小麦评比。在评比中发现了许多丰产单位。河北现已发现九个丰产县（每亩产一百二十斤至二百二十斤）、十七个丰产村（每亩产二百斤到四百斤）、八十三个丰产互助组和农业生产合作社（每亩产三百斤到五百斤）、三千九百二十八个丰产户（每亩产四百至六百斤，其中参加互助组和农业生产合作社的有二千九百七十户）。邯郸专区杜玉善的水地小麦，每亩产八百斤。临清崔五峰的旱地小麦，每亩产六百八十九斤。涉县山地活水蛟村有二百四十多亩麦田，去年每亩产一百二十四点五斤，今年每亩产三百零一斤。国营河北省农业试验场种了一百二十亩小麦，平均每亩产四百斤以上。国营冀衡农场新开的五千五百亩荒地，平均每亩产一百四十五、六斤，其中有二百亩平均每亩产三百五十斤。平原省每亩平均产一百斤以上的有二十二县，每亩产八十斤到一百斤的有二十八县。另据新乡、安阳、湖西、濮阳四专区二十六县部分材料统计：每亩产四百斤以上的共三百二十一个单位，其中每亩产六百斤到八百斤以上的共五十八个单位。不少地区打破了历史上的小麦最高产量纪录。如安阳郭王度村过去只有一户的一亩小麦收过四百斤，今年有十二户每亩收获小麦四百至六百斤。全村一千二百一十亩麦田，每亩平均产二百六十六斤（去年每亩产一百八十二斤）。汤阴北周流村（灾区）全村小麦平均每亩产量近三百斤，其中韩金斗的佛手麦每亩产一千斤以上。武陟李恩通等七个互助组，水地小麦每亩产四百一十六斤，旱地每亩产二百八十八斤，丰产地每亩产六百零二斤，李恩通的丰产地每亩产九百一十二斤。原阳杨庄有一亩大麦收获了一千四百斤。山西虽然遭受了较重的灾害，但也出现了许多丰产模范。仅据运城专区五个县和临汾专区部分地区材料，已出现二百八十个小麦丰产户（水地每亩产三百斤到八百多斤，旱地每亩产二百斤到五百斤）、三个丰产模范组（每亩产四百斤至四百五十斤）。赵城下纪落村张德有一亩二分丰产地（水地），产一千零一斤，平均每亩产八百三十四斤。武乡魏明标农业生产合作社有一亩九分六厘丰产地（旱地），每亩产七百七十四斤。这些丰产模范的出现，特别是较大面积的丰产单位的出现，为今后小麦丰产树立了旗帜。这是今年农业生产上的大规模爱国增产竞赛运动的首次胜利。
    在小麦评比运动中，证明了“评比”是对农民最具体、最实际、最有效的教育方法。
    1、在“评比”中发现了许多丰产模范，打破了农民“生产到顶”的保守思想，树立了提高单位面积产量的观念。广大农民普遍注意了提高技术，加工加肥，大力向生产投资。过去很多农民说：“不种百亩，难打百石。”平原武陟县一个老农民参观了劳动模范的丰产地以后说：“种地一辈子，不知道地有这样大的劲。这一下可把我教育过来了。”各地进行“评比”以后，农民的生产情绪大为提高。河北大名县五区农民在“评比”后三天内，就犁完了麦地二万五千三百四十五亩，并把十八万九千一百五十车粪土送完了。不少农民在“评比”后立即作出了增置农具和投资计划。平原武陟县实行“评比”后，许多农民要求参加农场领导的技术委员会。农民说：“农场是种地的靠山”。国营农场和农民的关系更加密切了。凡“评比”工作做得好的地区，选种工作也很有成绩。据河北四十四县二千二百三十个村统计，已选麦种三千八百四十七万多斤，打下了今秋百分之五十的麦田改换优种的基础。
    2、在“评比”中，大大显示了组织起来的优越性，进一步引导农民走向互助合作的道路。河北大名一区后桑圈村农业生产合作社每亩小麦平均产一百三十五斤至一百五十斤，常年互助组每亩小麦平均产一百斤，临时互助组每亩小麦平均产九十斤。北堤村王孝宗农业生产合作社每亩小麦平均产一百三十八斤，这村一般的互助组平均每亩产一百一十斤，单干户平均每亩产九十斤。平原林县桑耳庄（山区）成百福农业生产合作社平均每亩产二百斤，长年互助组桑来山组平均每亩产一百二十斤，临时互助组桑石柱组平均每亩产一百斤，单干户桑立重平均每亩产六十五斤。许多这样的实例，最有力地教育了农民群众，在“评比”后，互助合作组织很快就发展和提高了。河北省大名县在“评比”中新发展了三千五百二十五个互助组，临时互助转为常年互助的有三千二百一十个组。饶阳县通过“评比”，使百分之八十的农户组织起来。
    3、广大群众经过“评比”，把户和组的生产计划，和国家利益密切结合起来了。他们从此消除了怕增加负担，怕露富的顾虑。农民在“评比”总结中认识到农民丰产是政府在经济上、技术上的大力扶持，互助合作的开展，爱国增产竞赛的发动和领导的结果，只有依靠党和人民政府的领导，才能创造丰衣足食的美满生活。农民在“评比”中具体地体会到新民主主义制度的优越性，大大提高了政治觉悟和生产热忱。（中共中央华北局政策研究室）
