Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. With the development of the national patriotic production increase movement, the mutual aid farming work in the first half of this year has made further progress. Revolutionary martyr's families and revolutionary military personnel families will receive more grain this autumn than in previous years.

    Various forms of fixed mutual aid farming systems have been universally implemented across the country: some are farmed by peasant households; some are farmed by mutual aid teams; some are farmed by agricultural production cooperatives; in some places, on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, mutual aid farmers and families of martyrs and military personnel sign mutual aid farming contracts for three to seven years. In the new district of Wuxing County, Zhejiang, etc., by early May, more than 80% of the land belonging to families of martyrs and military personnel lacking labor had implemented a fixed mutual aid farming system. The 32 mu of land belonging to families of martyrs and military personnel in Gaoyang Village, Shuikou Township, Wuxing County, are being farmed by eleven mutual aid teams, and a mutual aid farming contract has been signed to ensure a production increase of 20% to 25%. According to statistics from some areas of 29 counties in the old district of Shanxi, the land in these areas implementing fixed mutual aid farming systems such as contracting for farming, contracting for production, and contracting for labor, accounts for 94.4% of the mutual aid farming land area. In agriculturally advanced areas, the masses incorporate mutual aid farming land into agricultural production cooperatives for management. They stipulate reasonable methods that not only do not increase the burden on the cooperative and reduce the income of families of martyrs and military personnel, but also achieve the benefits of centralized planning, unified management, labor saving, and increased harvest. This is a very good creation and points out a new direction for mutual aid farming work.

    Due to the attention of local leading organs and the adoption of methods such as donating fertilizer, accumulating fertilizer, lending fertilizer, digging pits to compost manure, establishing public toilets, and increasing fertilizer work points, the amount of fertilizer applied to general mutual aid farming land this year has exceeded that of last year. According to statistics from 17 villages in Mancheng County, Hebei, the land of 32 families of martyrs and military personnel received one more large cart of fertilizer per mu than last year. The amount of fertilizer applied to the land of families of martyrs and military personnel in Banqiao Township, Wangjiang County, Anhui, increased by approximately 55% compared to last year.

    Many mutual aid farmers in Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, Ningxia, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces have enthusiastically launched mass patriotic production increase mutual aid farming competition movements. According to statistics from 73 villages in Lingchuan County, Shanxi, among 1,167 mutual aid farming teams, 626 teams have participated in the competition, and 235 mutual aid farming teams, 718 mutual aid farmers, and 196 families of martyrs and military personnel have been commended. Families of martyrs and military personnel in various places also actively participate in production, some even refusing mutual aid farming or assistance from the masses and cultivating the land entirely by themselves. In Zhilong County, Ningxia, 846 households, totaling 2,450 families of martyrs and military personnel, have joined mutual aid organizations and have become active members of various labor exchange mutual aid teams.

    Generally, mutual aid farming work in various places has overcome the past deviations of "those who should receive mutual aid farming not receiving it, and those who should not receive mutual aid farming receiving it." They have adopted a method of self-reporting by families of martyrs and military personnel, mass evaluation, and leadership decision-making, appropriately reducing the scope of mutual aid farming and reasonably expanding the scope of labor burden, so that families of martyrs and military personnel lacking labor can fully enjoy the preferential treatment of mutual aid farming. In Fu County, Shaanxi, the number of families of martyrs and military personnel enjoying mutual aid farming was 421 in 1950 and 359 in 1952, a decrease of 62 households; the number of farmers serving in mutual aid farming in the county was 4,609 in 1950 and 5,201 in 1952, an increase of 592 people.

    However, the development of mutual aid farming work across the country is still uneven; some areas have not completely changed the phenomenon of temporary dispatch of labor, some areas have not yet adequately solved the fertilizer problem for families of martyrs and military personnel, and there are still shortcomings such as excessively light or heavy burdens of mutual aid farming and failure to promptly settle mutual aid farming wages. These problems must be seriously addressed in future work in various places.

    在爱国增产运动中
    各地代耕工作有新进展
    烈属军属土地普遍实行固定代耕制
    【新华社二十二日讯】今年上半年的代耕工作，随着全国爱国增产运动的开展又前进了一步。革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，将在今年秋后得到比往年更多的粮食。
    全国各地已普遍实行各种形式的固定代耕制：有的由农家代耕；有的由互助组代耕；有的由农业生产合作社代耕；有的地方在自愿互利的原则下，由代耕农民和烈属、军属订立三年到七年的代耕合同。新区浙江吴兴等县，五月上旬已有百分之八十以上缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属的土地实行了固定代耕制。吴兴县水口乡高阳村烈属、军属的三十二亩田，由十一个互助组进行代耕，并订立了代耕合同，保证增产二成到二成半。老区山西二十九个县的部分地区的统计，各该地区今年实行包耕、包产、包工等固定代耕制的土地，占代耕土地面积百分之九十四点四。在农业先进地区，群众将代耕土地并入农业生产合作社去经营。他们规定合理办法，不仅不会使合作社增加负担和使烈属、军属减少收入，而且取得了集中计划，统一经营，节省劳力，增加收获的好处。这是一个很好的创造，为代耕工作指出了新的发展方向。
    由于各地领导机关的注意和采用献肥、积肥、贷肥、挖坑沤粪、建立公共厕所和增加肥料工票等方法，今年一般代耕土地的施肥量都超过了去年。据河北满城县十七个村的统计，三十二户烈属、军属的土地，每亩比去年多施肥一大车。安徽望江县板桥乡烈属、军属土地的施肥量，较去年增施肥料约百分之五十五以上。
    山西、河北、热河、宁夏、浙江、福建等省许多代耕农民，都热烈地展开了群众性的爱国增产代耕竞赛运动。据山西陵川县七十三个村的统计，在一千一百六十七个代耕组中，已有六百二十六个组参加了竞赛，有二百三十五个代耕组，七百十八个代耕农民和一百九十六个烈属、军属受到了表扬。各地烈属、军属也积极地参加生产，有的并谢绝群众的代耕或帮工，完全由自己来耕种土地。宁夏志龙县已有八百四十六户、二千四百五十名烈属、军属参加了互助组织，并且成为各个变工互助组中的积极分子。
    各地代耕工作，一般克服了过去“应代耕者未代耕，不应代耕者予以代耕”的偏向，采取烈属、军属自报、群众评比、领导决定的方式，适当地缩小了代耕面，合理地扩大了劳力负担面，使缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属，充分地享受代耕的优待。陕西鄜县一九五○年享受代耕的烈属、军属为四百二十一户，一九五二年为三百五十九户，减少了六十二户；该县一九五○年服代耕勤务的农民为四千六百零九人，一九五二年为五千二百零一人，增加了五百九十二人。
    但全国各地代耕工作的发展，仍是不平衡的；有些地区还没有完全改变临时派工的现象，部分地区尚未很好解决烈属、军属的肥料问题，并且还存在代耕负担的畸轻畸重，代耕工资未能及时清理等缺点。这些问题各地都须在今后工作中继续予以认真地解决。
