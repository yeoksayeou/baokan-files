Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Representatives of Beijing Christian Churches and Christian organizations gathered on the 21st of this month to protest the British ruling group's despicable actions in plotting to persecute Reverend Johnson. The meeting was presided over by Reverend Wang Zizhong of the North China Congregational Church. Speakers at the meeting included Ling Xianyang, Bishop of the North China Diocese of the Anglican Church of China, Jiang Yizhen, Acting President of Yanjing School of Religion, Reverend Qi Tingduo of the Methodist Church, and Yu Xiu'ai, President of the Beijing YWCA, among others. They unanimously condemned the British ruling group's shameless actions in persecuting Reverend Johnson. They pointed out that Reverend Johnson's public report in Britain about the crimes of American bacteriological warfare represented the just voice of all peace-loving people, and all faithful Christians should do their best to support him. The meeting unanimously passed a telegram of condolence to Reverend Johnson signed by various Christian churches and organizations.

The telegram stated: Reverend Johnson, you have raised the banner of the Prince of Peace to bear witness to the truth. We, the Christian churches of Beijing, firmly support your righteous actions and remember you in our prayers. Your prophetic voice will surely be supported and loved by righteous Christians all over the world. We have full confidence that the peace-loving British people and Christians will follow the Prince of Peace and not the God of War, and they will wake up to the truth and, under your call, carry out a heroic and resolute struggle for the solemn cause of mankind. Let Chinese and British Christians and all peace-loving Christians around the world work hard to protect human peace and a happy life. Peace must be saved, and peace will surely triumph. The telegram was signed by dozens of Christian churches and organizations, including the North China Diocese of the Anglican Church of China, the North China Annual Conference of the Methodist Church of China, the Hebei Association of the Christian Church of China, the Headquarters of the Chinese Salvation Army, the Beijing YMCA, Yanjing School of Religion, the North China District Council of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the North China Association of the Chinese Holiness Church, the General Assembly of the True Jesus Church, and the Chinese Bible Society.
