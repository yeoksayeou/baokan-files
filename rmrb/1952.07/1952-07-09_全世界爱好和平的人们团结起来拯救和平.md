    People Around the World Who Love Peace, Unite to Save Peace
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a special meeting in Berlin from the 1st to the 6th of this month to discuss important issues concerning the current defense of peace and the strengthening of the peace movement, and made corresponding resolutions. This meeting reflected the increasingly deep desire of the people of all countries who love peace for peace, and formulated a clear program for the further struggle for peace.
    The most urgent task currently in the struggle for peace is to immediately stop the Korean War and restore peace in Korea as soon as possible. We fully support the resolution of the Berlin Special Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on the issue of stopping the Korean War. The Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world who love peace have waged a resolute and widespread struggle to achieve a ceasefire in Korea, and forced the American aggressors to accept the Korean armistice negotiations a year ago. However, for the past year, the American aggressors have exhausted delaying tactics at the negotiation meetings and have created unlimited provocative incidents outside the negotiation venue, preventing the negotiations from reaching a complete agreement to this day.
    Now, the Korean armistice negotiations only have the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation left. Due to our consistent and persevering efforts, and after putting forward fair and reasonable solutions to the prisoner-of-war issue, which bankrupted the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel and undermine the negotiations, the US negotiating representative stated at the negotiation meeting on July 1 that they were willing to "seek an armistice in good faith to end the bloodshed in Korea," and expressed willingness to seek "a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides" on the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation. We welcome this willingness of the US side to negotiate. In order to further promote the early resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue, our side made a new effort at the Korean armistice negotiation meeting on July 3, suggesting that, according to the principles stipulated in Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, the prisoners of war on both sides should be reclassified according to nationality and region to correct the lists in order to repatriate prisoners of war on both sides to their homes to live peaceful lives. At the same time, in order to facilitate practical discussions on this proposal, our side also proposed that the plenary meeting of the delegations of both sides enter into administrative meetings. Administrative meetings have been held continuously for several days since the 4th of this month. Obviously, whether a ceasefire can be achieved in Korea as soon as possible depends entirely on the sincerity shown by the US side in this negotiation. However, the "sincerity" spoken of by the aggressors must be judged by "hearing their words and observing their actions." The Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world who love peace must continue to be vigilant and continue to work hard to force the aggressors to accept a just peace immediately.
    In its resolution on stopping the Korean War, the Berlin Special Meeting called on all countries to ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of bacteriological warfare methods, and adopted the appeal to all men and women of the world against bacteriological warfare from the Oslo Conference in April. We also fully support this. Only the American aggressors deliberately sabotage the international conventions prohibiting bacteriological weapons and are preparing to expand the crime of bacteriological warfare. At the recent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States brazenly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol of 1925, while the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty that the United States forced Western European countries to sign in Paris openly stipulated clauses regarding the production of atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, and openly stipulated that these things could be used for the purpose of war. The US's stubborn refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol is obvious. The people of the world who love peace cannot but act more widely and actively to wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors who refuse to ban bacteriological weapons. We must bring those criminals who use these heinous weapons to justice as war criminals.
    While invading Korea, the American aggressors are trying to revive the militarist forces of Japan and West Germany in Asia and Europe as tools for launching new wars. With such a criminal purpose, the American aggressors do not hesitate to destroy international agreements and disregard the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and the people of Asia, the German people and the people of Europe, and the people of all countries who love peace, and have forcibly imposed on the Japanese people the separate "peace treaty" with Japan, the US-Japan Security Treaty, and the so-called Administrative Agreement, which enslave Japan and threaten the peace of Asia and the world, and have also imposed on the West German people the so-called "General Treaty" that divides Germany and creates war. After signing this series of war treaties, the United States is turning Japan into its base of aggression in the East, and is forcing the Yoshida traitorous government to step up the expansion of the so-called "Police Reserve Force" and the establishment of the so-called "Defense Corps"; and is turning West Germany into its base of aggression in the West, and is doing its utmost to obstruct the conclusion of an all-German peace treaty and the peaceful unification of Germany, and is planning to establish the so-called "European Army" with the West German army as its core; in this way, the people of Asia, the people of Europe, and the people of all countries of the world are repeatedly subjected to increasingly serious threats of war. Therefore, the people of Asia, including the Japanese people, and the people of Europe, including the German people, and the people of all countries who love peace in the world are launching a resolute struggle to smash the war treaties that the United States has imposed on the Japanese and West German people.
    The purpose of this struggle is to make Germany and Japan independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified countries, so as to eliminate the crisis of war and defend the peace of Europe, Asia, and the world. To this end, the Soviet government has repeatedly sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, advocating the convening of a four-power conference to begin discussions on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of an all-German government. This just proposition of the Soviet Union has been warmly supported by the German people and the European people. Regarding the situation in Japan, China and the Soviet Union have also repeatedly expressed their willingness to see Japan gain independence and freedom; the Japanese people have long unanimously shouted the slogan "Oppose rearmament and strive for national independence"; and the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference scheduled to be held in September this year has also listed "Opposing Japanese re-militarization, opposing the use of Japan as a base of aggression, in order to eliminate the serious threat to peace in the Asian and Pacific region" as one of the main topics.
    In view of this situation in Europe and Asia and the common demands of the people of all countries, the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council separately issued a letter to the governments of the four powers and the people of the world on the German issue and two resolutions on opposing Japanese re-militarization and fighting for a democratic Japan. These are all great appeals that resonate deeply in people's hearts. The German people, the Japanese people, the European people, and the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region will draw great inspiration from these two resolutions to carry out a more resolute and courageous struggle to achieve the goals set forth in these two resolutions.
    The world movement to defend peace has achieved unprecedented development since the Warsaw Peace Congress was held in November 1950, and the world's forces for defending peace have become even stronger. The World Peace Council's call for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of all armaments under strict supervision has been widely responded to and supported by the people of all countries who love peace; and the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact has been signed and supported by nearly one-third of the world's population. The achievements of the peace movement and the rapid growth of peace forces have shaken the foundations of the imperialist war system headed by the United States, and have made the reactionary governments of American imperialism and its vassal states even more despised by the people and fallen into a state of isolation. But precisely because of this, the imperialist war forces are continuing to make desperate struggles; they are trying to save their inevitable demise by intensifying their preparations for war. This sinister situation requires that the people of all countries who love peace must unite more widely and act more resolutely to defend lasting world peace. The Berlin Conference decided to hold the World People's Congress for the Defense of Peace in Vienna on December 5 this year, which will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by all peace-loving people around the world.
    As the Berlin Conference of the World Peace Council pointed out in its declaration on convening the World People's Peace Congress: "Peace can be saved! Peace must be saved!" In order to save peace, let all who yearn for peace join hands more closely and continue to move forward bravely! Peace will surely triumph over war!

### 全世界爱好和平的人们团结起来拯救和平

    全世界爱好和平的人们团结起来拯救和平
    世界和平理事会常务委员会于本月一日至六日在柏林举行了特别会议，讨论了当前保卫和平与加强和平运动的重要问题，并作出了相应的决议。这个会议，反映了各国爱好和平人民对于和平的日益深切的渴望，并为进一步争取和平的斗争制订了明确的纲领。
    当前争取和平的最急迫的任务，就是立即停止朝鲜战争，早日恢复朝鲜的和平。我们完全拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会柏林特别会议关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议。中朝人民与世界爱好和平人民都为了争取实现朝鲜的停战而进行了坚决的、广泛的斗争，并迫使美国侵略者在一年前接受了朝鲜停战谈判。但是一年来，美国侵略者在谈判会议上耍尽了拖延手法，在谈判会场之外无限制地制造挑衅事件，使谈判至今不能达成完全的协议。
    现在，朝鲜停战谈判只剩战俘遣返一个问题了。由于我方一贯的坚忍努力，并对解决战俘问题提出了公平合理的解决办法，使美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋与破坏谈判的手法一一破产之后，美方谈判代表于七月一日的谈判会议上表示愿意“诚意地觅求停战，以终止朝鲜的流血”，表示愿意在战俘遣返问题上寻求“一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”。美方这种愿意协商的态度是我方所欢迎的。为了进一步促成战俘问题的早日解决，我方在七月三日朝鲜停战谈判会议上又作了一次新的努力，建议根据停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款所定的原则，对双方战俘依照国籍和地区进行重新分类，校正名单，以便遣返双方战俘回家过和平生活。同时，为了便于切实商讨这一建议，我方并提议双方代表团大会进入行政性会议。自本月四日以来行政性会议已连续举行了数日。显然，朝鲜能否早日实现停战，完全要看美方在这次协商中所表现的诚意了。但是对于侵略者口中所说的“诚意”，必须要“听其言而观其行”。中朝人民和世界爱好和平人民还必须继续提高警惕，并继续努力，迫使侵略者立即接受公正的和平。
    柏林特别会议在关于停止朝鲜战争的决议中，要求一切国家批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用细菌作战方法的日内瓦议定书，并通过了四月间奥斯陆会议反对细菌战的告全世界男女书。这也是我们所完全拥护的。只有美国侵略者蓄意破坏禁用细菌武器的国际公约，并准备扩大细菌战的罪行。在最近举行的联合国安全理事会的会议上，美国就悍然拒绝了苏联所提出的号召一切国家参加并批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的建议，而美国迫使西欧国家在巴黎签订的所谓“欧洲防御集团”条约，却公然规定了关于生产原子、化学和细菌武器的条款，并公然规定了得为战争的目的使用这些东西。美国顽固地拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的用心是显而易见的了。全世界爱好和平的人民不能不更加广泛地、积极地行动起来，向拒绝禁用细菌武器的美国侵略者进行坚决的斗争。我们一定要使那些使用这种罪恶武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。
    美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的同时，在亚洲和欧洲正力图复活日本和西德的军国主义势力，作为它发动新战争的工具。由于怀着这样一个罪恶的目的，美国侵略者不惜破坏国际协定，并不顾日本人民和亚洲人民、德国人民和欧洲人民以及世界各国爱好和平人民的坚决反对，既将奴役日本、威胁亚洲及世界和平的单独对日“和约”、美日安全条约及所谓行政协定强加在日本人民身上，又将分裂德国、制造战争的所谓“一般性条约”强加在西德人民身上。在签订了这一系列的战争条约之后，美国正在使日本变为它在东方的侵略基地，并迫使吉田卖国政府加紧扩充所谓“警察后备队”和建立所谓“防御兵团”；又正在使西德变成它在西方的侵略基地，极力阻挠全德和约的缔结和德国的和平统一，并策划建立以西德军队为核心的所谓“欧洲军”；这样亚洲人民、欧洲人民和全世界各国爱好和平的人民就重复受到越来越严重的战争威胁。因此，包括日本人民在内的亚洲人民和包括德国人民在内的欧洲人民和全世界爱好和平的各国人民，正在为粉碎美国强加在日本和西德人民身上的战争条约而展开了坚决的斗争。
    这一斗争的目的，是为了要使德国和日本都成为独立、民主、和平、统一的国家，以消除战争的危机，保卫欧洲、亚洲和全世界的和平。为此，苏联政府已屡次照会美、英、法政府，主张召开四国会议，以便开始商谈关于缔结对德和约与建立全德政府的问题。苏联的这一公正主张得到了德国人民与欧洲人民的热烈拥护。对于日本的情势，中国与苏联也曾屡次表示愿意看到日本获得独立和自由；日本人民更早已一致地喊出了“反对重新武装，争取民族独立”的口号；定于今年九月举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议也已把“反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁”列为主要议题之一。
    鉴于欧洲和亚洲的这种情势和各国人民的共同要求，世界和平理事会柏林特别会议分别作出了关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书及关于反对日本重新军国主义化、为民主的日本而斗争的两项决议。这都是深入人心的伟大号召。德国人民、日本人民、欧洲人民、亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民将从这两项决议中获得重大的鼓舞力量，来为实现这两项决议所规定的目标进行更为坚决英勇的斗争。
    世界保卫和平运动自华沙和平大会于一九五○年十一月举行以来，已获得了空前的发展，世界保卫和平的力量已更为强大了。世界和平理事会要求禁用大规模毁灭性武器、在严格监督下裁减一切军备的号召，都得到了各国爱好和平人民的广泛响应和支持；缔结和平公约的宣言更得到了全世界将近三分之一人口的签名拥护。和平运动的成就与和平力量的迅速增长，已使以美国为首的帝国主义战争体系根基动摇，更使美国帝国主义及其仆从国家的反动政府更加受到人民的唾弃而陷入孤立的境地。但是也正因为这样，帝国主义战争势力正继续作绝望的挣扎；它们正力图以加紧备战的行动，来挽救它们不可避免的覆亡。这种险恶的形势，要求各国爱好和平的人民必须更加广泛地团结起来，更加坚决地行动起来，以保卫世界的持久和平。柏林会议决定于今年十二月五日在维也纳举行世界人民保卫和平大会，这无疑地将得到全世界一切爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。
    正如世界和平理事会柏林会议在关于召开世界人民和平大会的宣言中所指出的：“和平可以拯救！和平必须拯救！”为了拯救和平，让一切渴望和平的人们更加紧密地携起手来，继续奋勇前进吧！和平一定要战胜战争的！
