The Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team in Yongji County, Jilin Province, have achieved good results in the concrete implementation of the "Integration Contract" since it was signed in January this year (see this newspaper on April 10).

In order to smoothly fulfill the "Integration Contract," the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized discussions among its cadres on the significance of signing the "Integration Contract" and the methods for realizing it, inspiring the enthusiasm of the cooperative's cadres and establishing confidence in realizing the "Integration Contract" and overcoming difficulties. Subsequently, after research, the various departments within the cooperative jointly established "contact contracts" for their work. The contract stipulated that planning personnel should guarantee the submission of business plans according to the needs of the mutual aid team; purchasing and sales personnel should guarantee the purchase and sale of goods according to the plan; accounting personnel should guarantee the funds needed for supply and marketing operations; and salespersons should guarantee a friendly attitude towards customers, introduce commodity specifications and quality, and reduce commodity losses, etc. This greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of the cooperative's cadres. Therefore, in the four months from January to April this year, the supply and marketing cooperative fully supplied the production and living materials needed by the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team and promoted the sale of some of the mutual aid team's products.

Because the cooperative helped the mutual aid team formulate production and consumption plans, it also grasped the basic economic situation of the entire village and overcame blindness in business operations. In the fourth quarter of 1951, the cooperative had accumulated more than 23 million yuan in funds due to blindly purchasing medicinal materials and other agricultural and sideline products, as well as supplying materials that did not meet the needs of the masses. However, in the first quarter of this year, there was no backlog of goods purchased, and 40 percent of the materials accumulated in the fourth quarter of last year were sold. Because the supply and marketing were timely, the capital turnover was also accelerated. In the first quarter of this year, the cooperative's capital turnover totaled 5.3 times, exceeding the original plan by 0.3 times. Because the cadres strengthened their sense of responsibility and frequently checked the storage of goods, the loss of eight commodities, including coarse grains, fine grains, oil, salt, alkali noodles, wine, vermicelli, and dried shrimp, was reduced in the first quarter. In addition, improvements were also made in reducing freight, reducing expenses, and other aspects.

On the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team side, because production and consumption plans were formulated, the blindness of sideline production in the past was first overcome. In order to ensure that sideline products could be sold in a timely manner, the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team first signed a contract with the cooperative to sell straw bags this spring. In order to realize the contract, they universally improved their working methods (implementing a rational division of labor in weaving bags, making ropes, and sewing bags), thereby greatly increasing the output of straw bags. In the past, households with carts and horses transported the straw bags to Jilin City for sale (the village is 60 li from Jilin City), and the problem of households without horses could not be solved. Since the "Integration Contract" was signed, this problem has been solved. At the same time, the "Integration Contract" can make the income of farmers more reasonable. In the process of signing the "Integration Contract," all members of the group gained a deeper understanding of the benefits of planned production and consumption, which strongly promoted the realization of the bumper harvest plan. For example, after discussion, the group members unanimously believed that "only by strengthening planning can things be done well." Based on this understanding, the group's seed selection, seedling cultivation, and fertilization work this year were all carried out according to the original plan.

When the mutual aid team fulfills the "Integration Contract," it adopts the principle of individual responsibility and organizational guarantee, that is, the production and consumption plan of the mutual aid team is composed of the individual plans of each member of the mutual aid team. Once the plan is formulated, the mutual aid team has the responsibility to supervise its completion. If an individual cannot complete the plan, the responsibility (such as a fine) is still borne by the individual. This strengthens each member of the mutual aid team's legal awareness of the contract.

At present, the execution of the contract between the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the mutual aid team is relatively flexible when the plans of both parties cannot be completely perfect. For example, it is stipulated that 95 percent completion of the plan by both parties is considered full completion, and it is stipulated that if the supplied cloth is of the same color, a difference of 50,000 yuan up or down per bolt can be substituted; if both parties agree, different varieties can also be exchanged.

Signing the "Integration Contract" is a new task, and there are still some issues that need to be further resolved. The first is the need to further strengthen planning. The "Integration Contract" between the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team stipulated that "specific implementation contracts should be signed for the supply and marketing of major materials," but the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative only signed two straw bag sales contracts with the mutual aid team after signing the "Integration Contract," and only began signing purchase and order contracts on a monthly basis from May. Similarly, no specific implementation contract was signed for the supply of production materials. Although the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team's production materials are almost entirely supplied by the cooperative, this is only the result of the cooperative giving the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team priority in purchasing based on the "Integration Contract." If other mutual aid teams widely sign "Integration Contracts" with the cooperative without signing specific implementation contracts for the supply of production and living materials, the cooperative will not be able to guarantee the realization of planning in supply and marketing. The second is to better ensure the supply of goods. When signing the "Integration Contract," the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative had to put in a lot of effort to find sources of goods, and the current problem was only solved with the strong support and priority supply of the county cooperative. If the county supply and marketing cooperative signs contracts with more mutual aid teams, the supply of goods will be more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to closely rely on state-owned commerce, propose plans as soon as possible, and maintain close contact with state-owned trade departments, and also use contract forms to fix this supply of goods.

    二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组
    数月来执行“结合合同”收到良好效果
    吉林省永吉县二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组自今年一月份签订了“结合合同”后（见四月十日本报），数月来，在具体执行合同过程中，已经收到了很好的效果。
    二道沟供销合作社为了顺利地履行“结合合同”，曾经组织了社内干部讨论签订“结合合同”的意义和实现“结合合同”的办法，启发了合作社干部的工作积极性，树立起对实现“结合合同”、克服困难的信心。随后，经过研究，社内的各部门共同订立了工作上的“联系合同”，合同中规定：计划人员保证按互助组需要提出业务计划；采购、推销人员保证按计划进货、销货；会计人员保证供销业务需用的资金；营业员保证对顾客态度和蔼，介绍商品规格、质量并减少商品损耗等。这样一来，大大加强了合作社干部的工作责任心，因此从今年一月到四月的四个月当中，供销社充分供应了薛云虎互助组的生产、生活资料，并推销了互助组的一部分生产品。
    合作社由于帮助互助组订立了生产、消费计划，也掌握了全村经济基本情况，克服了业务经营中的盲目性。该社一九五一年第四季度曾因盲目收购药材和其他农、副产品，以及供应的物资不合群众需要，而积压资金二千三百余万元；但今年第一季度进货就没有积压，同时还将去年第四季度积压的物资推销了百分之四十。因为供销及时，也就加速了资金周转。今年第一季度该社资金计共周转五点三次，超过原计划零点三次。由于干部加强了工作责任心，经常检查商品保管情况，在第一季度内粗粮、细粮、油、盐、碱面、酒、粉条、海米等八种商品都降低了损耗。此外，在降低运费、减少开支等各方面也都有所改进。
    在薛云虎互助组方面，由于制订了生产、消费计划，首先克服了过去副业生产的盲目性。薛云虎互助组为了保证副业产品能够及时找到销路，今春先与合作社订立了草袋推销合同。为了实现合同，他们又普遍改进了工作方法（实行织袋、打绳、缝袋等合理分工），因而大大提高了草袋的产量。过去有车马的户，自己把草袋送到吉林市推销（该村离吉林市六十里），无马户的问题解决不了，自订立“结合合同”后，这个问题已经得到了解决。同时订立“结合合同”可以使农民的收入使用得更合理。全组组员在签订“结合合同”过程中，对计划生产和消费的好处都有了进一步的认识，从而有力地推动了丰产计划的实现。例如，经过讨论，组员一致认为：“只有加强计划才能把事办好。”在这一认识的基础上，该组今年的选种、育苗、施肥等工作都是按照原订计划进行的。
    互助组履行“结合合同”时，是采取个人负责，组织保证的原则，即互助组的生产、消费计划是由互助组每个成员的个人计划汇集而成，计划一经拟定，互助组有监督完成之责，如个人不能完成计划，责任（如罚款）仍由个人负担。这样就加强了每个互助组员对合同的法律观念。
    目前，二道沟供销合作社和互助组双方计划尚不能做到完整无缺的情况下，他们执行合同的规定是比较机动的。如规定双方完成计划百分之九十五就算全部完成，规定供给的布如同样颜色，一匹上下不差五万元时可以代替；如经双方同意，不同品种亦可调换。
    订立“结合合同”是一个新的工作，尚有若干问题有待进一步解决。首先就是需要进一步加强计划性的问题。二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组的结合合同内曾规定：“对主要物资的供销签订具体执行合同”，但二道沟供销合作社自签订“结合合同”后仅与互助组订立了两次草袋的推销合同，从五月份才开始按月签订订购合同。同样，供给生产资料也没签订具体执行合同。虽然薛云虎互助组的生产资料几乎已全部由合作社供应，但这仅仅是合作社根据“结合合同”给薛云虎互助组优先采购的结果。如果其他互助组都与合作社广泛签订“结合合同”，而不签订生产、生活资料供应的具体执行合同时，合作社在供应和推销上就将不能保证计划性的实现。其次就是要更好地保证商品供应。二道沟供销合作社在签订“结合合同”时，曾因商品来源很费苦心，后经县社大力支持和优先供应才解决了当前的问题。如果该县供销合作社与更多的互助组订立合同，则商品供应将更为费力，因此必须紧密地依靠国营商业，及早提出计划，经常与国营贸易部门取得密切联系，同时也应用合同形式把这种商品供应固定下来。
