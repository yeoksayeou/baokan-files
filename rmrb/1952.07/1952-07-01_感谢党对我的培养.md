    Thank the Party for Nurturing Me
    Song Baoliang, Deputy Director of the Second Mine, Datong Mining Bureau

    How should I celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Party's birthday? I've been thinking about this for days.

    Since I was a child, I was a poor person who lacked food and clothing. Before liberation, I was beaten and bullied every day. At that time, I felt that living was suffering, and life was like a long, dark road that would never end.

    The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army liberated Datong, and we workers immediately saw the light. However, at that time, my understanding of the Party was still vague, and of course, I didn't have a final goal to strive for. After the continuous education and help from the leaders, I further realized the loveliness and greatness of the Party. In April 1949, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, my political consciousness has been continuously improved, and I have worked even harder. In 1949, the higher-ups promoted me to work in management at No. 5 Well, and then continued to promote me. Now I am the Deputy Director of the Second Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau. In 1950, I was also elected as a member of the Datong Municipal People's Government. In the past, people called us "coal blacks," but now "coal blacks" have been elected as members of the Municipal Government and Deputy Mine Directors. This is something that no one could have expected in a million lifetimes. I know that this honor is given to me by the people, given to me by the Party. I know that my ability is still very poor, and I cannot meet the workers' expectations of me, and my contribution to the country is still too little. But I have the determination and confidence to do a better job. Because with the Party's cultivation and leadership and the help of comrades, as long as I study hard and work hard, there are no difficulties that we cannot overcome. Comrade Song Yuchuan, the Secretary of the General Branch of our Second Mine, constantly points out my shortcomings and the direction of my efforts, so that I can continue to progress. I now swear to Chairman Mao: I am a glorious Communist Party member, and I must not fail the Party's cultivation of me and the Party's infinite glory; I guarantee that I will better fight for the Party's cause to the end in the future.

### 感谢党对我的培养

    感谢党对我的培养
    大同矿务局第二矿副矿长　宋宝亮
    我该用什么来庆祝党的三十一周年的生日呢？好几天前我心里就想着这件事。
    我从小就是缺吃少穿的穷人。解放以前，我每天挨打受气，那时候，我觉得活着就是受苦，日子像万里长的黑路一样，一辈子也走不到头。
    共产党、解放军把大同解放了，我们工人立刻见到了光明。可是，在当时我对党的认识还很模糊，当然更没有最后的奋斗目标。经过领导同志对我不断的教育帮助，我才进一步认识了党的可爱和伟大。一九四九年四月，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。由于受到了党的培养教育，我的政治觉悟在不断地提高，我做工作也更加努力。一九四九年上级提拔我到五号井做管理工作，以后又不断提拔我。现在我已是大同矿务局第二矿的副矿长了。一九五○年我又当选为大同市人民政府的委员。过去人家都说咱们是“煤黑子”，现在“煤黑子”却当选为市政府委员和副矿长了。这真是万辈子料不到的事。我知道，这光荣是人民给我的，是党给我的，我知道自己的能力还很差，不能够满足工友们对我的希望，对国家的贡献也还太少。不过我有决心也有信心，把工作作得更好。因为在党的培养领导和同志们的帮助下，只要自己努力学习，努力工作，我们没有克服不了的困难。我们二矿党的总支书记宋玉川同志就不断地指出我的缺点和努力的方向，使我得以不断地进步。我现在向毛主席宣誓：我是个光荣的共产党员，决不能辜负党对我的培养，和党的无限光荣；我保证今后要更好地为党的事业奋斗到底。
