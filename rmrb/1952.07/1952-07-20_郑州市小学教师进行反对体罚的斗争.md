    Zhengzhou Primary School Teachers Conduct Struggle Against Corporal Punishment

    To the Editor: Recently, primary school teachers in Zhengzhou City conducted a struggle against corporal punishment. This struggle began in late March of this year. After studying documents and examining their thinking, the teachers unanimously recognized that corporal punishment is a remnant of feudal education from the old society and are willing to thoroughly transform their thinking and change their work style in the future.

    Since the liberation of Zhengzhou, although the political awareness of teachers has generally improved, and there have been some improvements in teaching methods, the phenomenon of corporal punishment is still very serious among some teachers, such as verbal abuse, standing as punishment, kneeling as punishment, confinement, tearing the mouth, twisting ears, and so on. Take Jing Meilun, the principal of Longgang Elementary School, for example, he has consistently used corporal punishment methods to manage students. He often intimidates and insults students loudly, or beats them with a board. Once, he lost a woolen sweater, so he threatened two students to hand it over, and tied them up, declaring that he would send them to a labor reform brigade. Yin Zerun, a teacher at Yingmen Street Elementary School, often insulted students, so the students were afraid of him, and even when they urinated in class, they dared not report it to him. Zhang Qiwun, a teacher at the Zhengzhou Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, often acted arrogantly, and the students were afraid of him. At the beginning of this semester, the number of students who transferred out of the class because of this reached 40% of the class size.

    Although this struggle against corporal punishment has achieved great results, primary school teachers in Zhengzhou City must continue to strengthen their learning and improve themselves in order to improve their teaching work.

    郑州市小学教师进行反对体罚的斗争
    编辑同志：郑州市小学教师中最近进行了一次反体罚斗争。这次斗争是从今年三月下旬开始的，经过文件学习、思想检查，教师们都一致认识了体罚是旧社会封建教育遗留下来的东西，愿意在今后彻底改造自己的思想，改变自己的作风。
    郑州市解放以来，教师们的政治觉悟虽然普遍有了提高，在教学方法上也有了一些改进，但在一部分教师中，体罚的现象仍然是非常严重的，如谩骂、罚站、罚跪、禁闭、撕嘴、拧耳朵等等。就拿龙岗小学校长荆美伦来说，他一贯以体罚的方法来管理学生。他经常大声威吓、辱骂学生，或者用板子打他们。有一次他丢了一件毛线衣，他就威吓两个学生把它交出来，并且把他俩捆绑起来，声言要把他俩送往劳动改造大队。营门街小学教员阴泽润经常辱骂学生，因此同学都怕他，甚至在课堂上撒出尿时也不敢向他报告。郑州师范学校附属小学教员张其文经常耍态度，学生都怕他，本学期开学时，该班学生因此而转学的达该班人数的百分之四十。
    这次反体罚斗争虽然取得了很大的成绩，郑州市小学教师还必须继续加强学习，提高自己，以改进教学工作。
