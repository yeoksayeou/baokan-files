Comrades, gentlemen:

As we commemorate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is open to traffic. This is a great joyous event in the railway construction of New China, and a great joyous event in the economic construction of the Southwest. On behalf of Chairman Mao, I extend my congratulations to the conference, and present this glorious banner with Chairman Mao's personal inscription –

"Congratulations on the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, continue to work hard to build the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway" to all the staff and workers of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau on behalf of Chairman Mao.

When this railway was being built, it had been less than half a year since the liberation of the Southwest. At that time, the national financial and economic situation had not yet improved, but Chairman Mao, concerned about the difficulties in the lives of the people in the Southwest, approved the allocation of funds from the Central People's Government to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The problem that the people of Sichuan had longed for for more than 40 years and that had not been solved in Chinese history was solved in the New China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Therefore, the opening of this railway should first of all thank our beloved and great people's leader Chairman Mao. Secondly, we should thank the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Southwest Military and Political Committee for their direct leadership and assistance to this railway, thank the local organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels, the democratic parties, the people's governments at all levels, and the People's Liberation Army, as well as all the staff, military workers, and civilian workers who participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and thank the railway administrations across the country for their enthusiastic support in terms of manpower and technology. At the same time, we should also thank the Soviet experts for their help and guidance.

The early completion of this railway is due to the reliance on the strength and wisdom of the masses in the work, and the mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Because of the reliance on the masses, many new creations have appeared among the masses. For example, the blasting method created by civilian worker Xie Jiaquan reduced the explosive consumption per cubic meter of stone from eight ounces to three and a half ounces; the single-person percussion drilling method created by civilian worker Yan Shaogui increased the efficiency of drilling percussion holes in hard rock from eight meters per day to 30.22 meters. The old engineer Lan Tian proposed that the Chengdu Engineering Section use a new line, shortening the line by 23 kilometers and saving the state 15 billion yuan in materials and construction costs; after the Engineering Corps summarized and promoted the advanced production team's blasting experience of Xiao Menggang, the work efficiency of the entire team increased by 50% to 150%.

In the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Communist Party members enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and became models of uniting the masses, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks. Such as Zhang Qihou, the first-class model for erecting the Tuojiang River Bridge, Section Chief of the Locomotive Depot, Mo Shaoting, train driver Feng Wenxuan, Deputy Director of the Forging Factory, Gao A'er, foundry workers Zhou Guanglai and Yu Jinhai, as well as the national model worker Wang Changhua, and Comrade Chai Jiujin who sacrificed his life for the emergency repair of the Tuojiang River Bridge, etc., they were all able to unite the masses, overcome difficulties, study and improve technology, and improve production efficiency in their work, and made many contributions to the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

The imperialists attempted to suffocate our new China's industrial construction by blockading, embargoing, and severing trade, but we have the help of the great socialist Soviet Union and many new democratic fraternal countries. On the one hand, we must resist the United States and aid Korea, support the Chinese People's Volunteers to cooperate with the Korean People's Army to fight against powerful enemies; on the other hand, we must explore experience, train cadres, and carry out construction in order to build China from an agricultural country into a powerful industrialized country. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the construction of railways, from steel rails, sleepers, to fishplates and screws, almost all relied on foreign imports. In addition to striving for the friendly assistance of the above-mentioned fraternal countries, our people's railways also adhered to Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance, "pooling the wisdom and efforts of the masses, and using local materials." All the steel rails, fishplates and screws used in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were not only domestic products, but were also manufactured locally in Sichuan. The people of Sichuan once universally launched a campaign to donate sleepers, ensuring the quality of the sleepers and timely supply. In the bridge and culvert projects, a large amount of locally produced stone was also used, saving a lot of steel and cement, which was both economical and durable.

In the construction process of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, it should be particularly mentioned that it absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, the Soviet method of layered filling and compaction of roadbeds was adopted, which not only avoided the waste of stone ballast, but also made the project solid, so that there would be no rework or collapse in the future, ensuring the safety of driving; when building bridges and culverts, the suggestions of Soviet experts were adopted, and waterproof layers were laid to prevent rainwater erosion and extend the service life of the bridges and culverts.

The entire construction process of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway proves a very important truth, that is, technology must serve politics, and the purely technical viewpoint of the past is not feasible. In the construction project of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, because politics led technology, all stale and conservative ideas were broken, the wisdom and strength of the masses were brought into play, the rationalization proposals of the masses were adopted, and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was learned, so that the project achieved better requirements.

There is an ancient Chinese poem that describes Sichuan as saying: "The road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven." In the past, due to the inconvenient transportation in the Southwest, the abundant products of Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," such as rice, salt, hemp, sugar, tung oil, coal, mountain products, and timber, could not be widely exchanged with other places, and the lives of the people were greatly affected. Now that this railway is open to traffic, it will play a very significant role in developing transportation in various parts of the Southwest, connecting urban and rural material exchanges, developing industry, prospering the economy, and improving the lives of the people in the Southwest, and will bring more benefits to the people of Sichuan.

In the future, we will continue to build railways in the Southwest. The railway from Chengdu to Tianshui will hold a groundbreaking ceremony today at the same time as celebrating the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. With the needs of the country's national defense construction and the future large-scale economic construction, the construction of the people's railways will have greater development. All railway workers! With the help of the Southwest Party, the People's Government, the People's Army, and people from all walks of life, we must carefully summarize our experience, improve the technology of building railways, and strive to continue to complete and develop the glorious task of the new China's transportation industry.

    在重庆庆祝“七一”暨成渝铁路全线通车大会上的讲话
    中央人民政府铁道部部长　滕代远诸位先生们，同志们：
    在纪念中国共产党的建党三十一周年的时候，成渝铁路全线通车了，这是新中国人民铁道建设中一件大喜事，也是西南经济建设中一件大喜事。我谨代表毛主席向大会祝贺，并将毛主席亲笔祝词——
    “庆贺成渝铁路通车，继续努力修筑天成路”这面光荣的锦旗，代表毛主席赠给西南铁路工程局全体职工同志们。
    这条铁路修筑时，西南解放还不到半年，当时全国的财政经济情况还没有好转，但毛主席关怀西南人民生活的困难，批准由中央人民政府拨款修筑成渝路。四川人民渴望了四十多年、在中国历史上没有能够解决的问题，在毛主席英明领导下的新中国获得了解决。因此这条铁路的通车，应该首先感谢我们亲爱的伟大的人民领袖毛主席。其次，应该感谢中共中央西南局和西南军政委员会对这条铁路的直接领导和帮助，感谢中国共产党的各级地方组织、各民主党派、各级人民政府和人民解放军，以及参加修筑成渝路的全体职工、军工、民工同志们，感谢全国各铁路管理局在人力和技术上的热情支援。同时我们还应该感谢苏联专家的帮助和指导。
    这条铁路的提前修通，是由于在工作中依靠了群众的力量和智慧，发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，是因为依靠了群众，也就在群众中出现了很多新创造。如民工谢家全创造的压引放炮法，每方石头的炸药消耗量从八两减到三两半；民工颜绍贵创造的单人冲炮法，使开坚石冲炮眼的工效，从每天八公尺提高到三零点二二公尺。老工程师蓝田提议成都工务段改用新线，缩短了二十三公里线路，替国家节省一百五十亿元的材料和施工费用；工程总队总结了萧梦岗先进生产小组的放炮经验，并加以推广后，全队的工作效率提高了百分之五十到百分之一百五十。
    共产党员在修筑成渝路中，热烈地响应党的号召，成为团结群众、克服困难、完成任务的模范。如架设沱江大桥的一等模范张启厚、机务段长么绍庭、火车司机冯文煃、锻工厂副主任高阿二、翻砂场工人周广来和余金海，以及全国劳动模范汪长华，还有为抢修沱江大桥而牺牲了的柴九斤同志等等，他们在工作中都能够团结群众，克服困难，钻研和改进技术，提高生产效率，对于成渝路的修筑都有着很多的贡献。
    帝国主义企图以封锁禁运、断绝贸易来窒息我们新中国的工业建设，但是我们有伟大的社会主义苏联和许多新民主主义的兄弟国家的帮助。我们一方面要抗美援朝，支持中国人民志愿军配合朝鲜人民军，对强大的敌人作战；另一方面又要摸索经验，培养干部，进行建设，以便把中国从一个农业的国家建设成为一个强大的工业化的国家。在国民党反动统治时期，修筑铁路，从钢轨、枕木、到鱼尾板和螺丝钉，几乎全部都是靠外国输入。我们人民的铁路，除了争取上述这些兄弟国家的友谊援助外，同时还根据毛主席自力更生的方针，“群策群力，就地取材”，成渝铁路所用的全部钢轨，鱼尾板和螺丝钉，不仅全是国货，而且都是在四川当地制造的。四川人民曾经普遍掀起了献枕木运动，保证了枕木质量好，而且供应及时。在桥梁涵洞工程上，也大量利用了当地所生产的石料，节省了许多钢料和洋灰，既经济又耐用。
    成渝路在修筑工程中，特别应该提到的是吸取了苏联的先进经验。如采用了苏联的路基分层填土打夯方法，不仅免去石碴浪费，而且使工程坚固，将来不致翻工或塌方，保证了行车的安全；修建桥梁涵洞时，采取了苏联专家的建议，铺设了防水层，不致受雨水侵蚀，延长了桥涵的使用年限。
    成渝路整个修筑过程，证明了一条很重要的道理，就是技术必须服务于政治，过去单纯的技术观点是行不通的。在成渝路的修筑工程中，由于政治领导了技术，就打破了一切陈腐的保守思想，发挥了群众的智慧和力量，采用了群众的合理化建议，学习了苏联先进经验，使工程达到了较好的要求。
    中国有一句古词描写四川说：“蜀道难，难于上青天”。过去由于西南交通不便，使号称“天府之国”的四川的丰富物产，如大米、食盐、麻、糖、桐油、煤炭、山货和木材等，不能和各地进行广泛的交流，人民生活受到了很大影响。现在这条铁路通车了，对于发展西南各地交通、沟通城乡物资交流、发展工业、繁荣经济、改善西南人民的生活等，将起非常重大的作用，将会给四川人民带来更多的利益。
    今后还要继续修筑西南的铁路，成都到天水的铁路就在今天与庆祝成渝铁路通车的同时，举行开工典礼。随着祖国国防建设和未来的全国大规模的经济建设的需要，人民铁路的建设将会有更大的发展。全体铁路职工同志们！在西南党、人民政府、人民军队和各界人民帮助下，我们要好好总结经验，提高修建铁路的技术，为继续完成和发展新中国交通运输事业的光荣任务而奋斗。
