    Our Great Motherland
    The workers of the Tangshan Power Plant, having learned from the Soviet Union's experience with rapid overhaul methods, have set a new national record for the overhaul of steam turbines, motors, and boilers. This is a picture of the plant's workers completely overhauling the more than 30-ton steam turbine cover, which had never been overhauled since the plant was built, in order to completely eliminate accidents and improve the efficiency of the turbine.
