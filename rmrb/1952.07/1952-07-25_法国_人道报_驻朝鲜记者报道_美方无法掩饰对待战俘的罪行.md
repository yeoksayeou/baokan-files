Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 24th: The French "L'Humanité" correspondent in Korea reported on the 22nd: Three days have passed since General Nam Il presented evidence proving that the U.S. fabricated POW lists and crossed out the names of POWs forced to act as special agents, but the U.S. has not yet responded. It is difficult to imagine what kind of answer they can give, because the documentary and material evidence held by the Korean and Chinese sides are provided by the U.S. itself.

In the past, the U.S. has always used the method of complete disregard to deal with such revelations. For example, they used this method to deal with General Nam Il's firm demand that they truthfully account for the U.S. massacre of POWs on Geoje Island. Although the whole world knows that hundreds of Korean and Chinese POWs were illegally killed, injured, blinded with tear gas, and brutally beaten by the U.S., the U.S. representatives in Panmunjom always pretend that the Korean and Chinese representatives have no right to interfere in this matter and refuse to discuss the issue. While playing deaf and dumb on these issues in Panmunjom, they demand that the Korean and Chinese sides believe the lies that the whole world has already seen through, saying that those POWs who are under the bayonet and cruel coercion have "freely" chosen the path that the U.S. has painstakingly planned for months.

Clark is now constantly shouting that the U.S. will never change their view, that is, more than half of the prisoners refuse to go home. Such lies, even without the corroborating evidence of U.S. mistreatment of POWs, are difficult to believe easily. But everyone knows that now, due to the confessions of the POWs forced to act as special agents, many facts have been brought to light, and more and more evidence of the bloodshed on Geoje Island has been discovered. Clark's repetition of this riddled and despicable lie at this time is an ominous sign for the negotiations. The current short duration of the meetings also indicates that the U.S. may be trying to stall the negotiations and maintain a state of tense war for ulterior motives.

### 法国“人道报”驻朝鲜记者报道  美方无法掩饰对待战俘的罪行

    法国“人道报”驻朝鲜记者报道
    美方无法掩饰对待战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十四日电】法国“人道报”驻朝鲜特派记者二十二日报道：自从南日将军提出证据，证明美方捏造战俘名单并勾掉被迫充当特务的战俘的名字以来，已经过了三天，但是美方还没有答复。很难想像他们能够作出什么样的答复，因为朝中方面所掌握的人证物证都是美方自己提供的。
    美方过去一直用完全置之不理的办法来对付这样的揭露。例如，他们就曾用这种办法来对付南日将军坚决要他们据实交代美方屠杀巨济岛战俘的情况的要求。虽然全世界都知道，数百名朝中战俘被美方以完全非法的方式杀害、打伤、用催泪性毒气弄瞎眼睛和毒打了，但是在板门店的美方代表却总是装模作样地说朝中代表管不着这种事情，拒绝讨论这个问题。他们在板门店对这些问题装聋卖傻，却要求朝中方面相信全世界都已洞悉的鬼话，说那些在刺刀尖和残酷胁迫之下的战俘，倒有“自由”选择了正好是美方处心积虑搞了好几个月之久的道路。
    克拉克现在一个劲儿叫喊美国决不改变他们的观点，就是说有一大半俘虏不肯回家。这样的谎话，纵使没有美方虐待战俘的旁证，也是难以使人轻易相信的。但是每个人都知道，现在由于被迫充当特务的俘虏的坦白，提出了许多事实，巨济岛上的流血事件已经发现了愈来愈多的证据了。克拉克在这个时候重复这个百孔千疮的卑鄙的谎言，对于谈判是一个凶兆。目前会议开得很短，这也表明了美方也许为了不可告人的目的，又在设法使谈判陷入僵局并保持紧张的战争状态。
