    Literary and Art Workers Should Value Workers' Opinions
    Editor: After reading articles such as "Shanghai Workers' Demands on Literary and Art Workers" in the People's Daily, I feel that the opinions and demands of Shanghai workers are very valuable. They reflect the urgent needs of the workers in New China for cultural life and their concern for literary and art workers. They are looking forward to new works by literary and art workers and are even more concerned about the ideological transformation of literary and art workers. Because they understand that if the ideological transformation of literary and art workers is not thorough, they will not be able to implement Chairman Mao's literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers well.
    With the development of the motherland's industry and the improvement of workers' lives, cultural life is increasingly becoming an indispensable thing for workers, and it will greatly encourage workers' production enthusiasm. Therefore, the task of literary and art workers is even more important. I suggest that literary and art workers in Shanghai and other places should accept the valuable opinions of the workers, improve their work through literary and art rectification and study, transform their thinking, integrate with the workers, and write more and better new works that meet the requirements of the workers, striving to be outstanding literary and art fighters of the Mao Zedong era who serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    文艺工作者应重视工人意见
    编辑同志：我在人民日报上看到“上海工人对文艺工作者提出的要求”等文后，我感觉上海工人提出的意见与要求是很宝贵的。他们反映了新中国的工人对文化生活的迫切要求，和对文艺工作者的关心。他们期待着文艺工作者的新作品，更关心文艺工作者的思想改造。因为他们了解，如果文艺工作者的思想不彻底改造，就不能很好地执行毛主席为工农兵服务的文艺方针。
    随着祖国工业的发展和工人生活的提高，文化生活日益成为工人不可缺少的东西，它也将大大地鼓舞工人的生产积极性。因此，文艺工作者的任务也就更加重大了。我建议上海和各地的文艺工作者很好地接受工人们的宝贵意见，通过文艺整风学习，改进自己的工作，改造自己的思想；和工人打成一片，写出更多更好更符合工人要求的新作品来，争取做一个优秀的、为工农兵服务的毛泽东时代的文艺战士。
