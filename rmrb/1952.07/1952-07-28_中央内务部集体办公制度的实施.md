    Implementation of the Collective Office System in the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs
    Yan Rongshui
    Since the Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs implemented the collective office system on December 19th last year, work efficiency has greatly improved. The facts of the past six months prove that collective office work is an effective way to eliminate bureaucracy.
    The Ministry of Internal Affairs has one department, four bureaus, one division, one office, and sixteen sections, with a total of more than one hundred cadres. In the past, each department, bureau, and section had its own office; the minister, directors, and bureau chiefs all had small offices. Official documents sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs from the outside had to go through four stations: the document section, the general office, the bureaus, and the sections, and be registered four times; outgoing documents had to be registered six times. Because of the layer-by-layer registration and transfer, a lot of time was wasted, and work efficiency was not high. Incoming documents often took two days to reach the person in charge, and outgoing documents often took several days to leave the ministry. Although the document processing regulations stipulated that general incoming documents should be completed within seven days, only 39 percent were completed within the stipulated time. Some incoming documents were backlogged for two months or even more than half a year. Because each unit guarded its own corner, there was little contact with each other, and they did not understand each other's business. Documents were transferred layer by layer, requests for instructions were written, and opinions were drafted. Papers flew around. This situation had a certain impact on the development of the work.
    After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in early December last year, during the anti-bureaucracy exhibition held by the central political and legal departments, Xie Juezai, the minister of the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs, in light of the situation within the ministry, instructed the implementation of collective office work. At that time, some cadres believed: "The principle is correct, but it is difficult to implement." Some were reluctant to leave their small stalls and felt that collective office work was restrictive; others worried that after the implementation of collective office work, the large number of people, telephones, and noise would affect work, and so on. After carefully considering the above opinions, the leading comrades of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, on the one hand, held various meetings to launch criticism and self-criticism, criticize various laissez-faire and conservative ideas, and educate everyone to recognize the benefits of collective office work; on the other hand, they put forward some specific measures after research, such as concentrating the telephones in the duty room, and when using the telephone, going to the duty room to make the call; setting up several meeting rooms around the office, and going to the meeting room to hold meetings or talk to people, so as not to affect everyone. This dispelled the ideological concerns of some cadres and enabled the collective office to maintain good working order.
    After the implementation of the collective office system, its advantages gradually became apparent. Due to the reform of the system, bureaucracy has been initially overcome. After canceling the internal receiving and dispatching of departments, bureaus, and sections, and establishing a document operation inspection team, the receiving and dispatching of documents only requires one registration each. The original receiving and dispatching registration book has been replaced by the current three-part receiving and dispatching form. That is, the document section fills out the three-part form for incoming documents, one copy is stored in the document section, one copy is handed over to the operation inspection team, and one copy is filed. After the person in charge of the主管 bureau approves the incoming document, the operation inspection team directly finds the person in charge to sign for it and directly urges them to check it. The operation inspection team fills out the three-part form for outgoing documents, one copy is stored in the operation inspection team, one copy is stored in the document section, and one copy is filed. The drafting and sealing only require a signature on the three-part form. In this way, the receiving and dispatching of documents has been reduced from four stations to two stations, the registration of incoming documents has been reduced from four times to one time, and the registration of outgoing documents has been reduced from six times to one time. After the procedures were simplified, incoming documents could generally be delivered to the person in charge within two hours; outgoing documents could be sent out on the same day. Due to the improvement of the system and the increased enthusiasm of the staff, 60 percent of general documents are now completed within five days of receipt. The phenomenon of delaying and accumulating the processing of official documents has been greatly reduced.
    After the implementation of collective office work, the contact between superiors and subordinates and between various bureaus has become closer. Problems that could not be solved in a few days due to layer-by-layer verification and transfer can now be solved in a few words. Subordinate cadres are particularly satisfied with this. In addition, staff members can concentrate on reading the drafts of documents issued by various units, the work reports from various places, and the major events of the ministry during collective office hours; thus, they have strengthened their understanding of each other, strengthened the collective concept of the staff, and the business and policy level of the staff have also been improved.
    Collective office work saves manpower and material resources. The reform of the receiving and dispatching system has enabled seven unnecessary receiving and dispatching personnel to participate in business work. The improvement of work efficiency has also made the necessary allocation of manpower possible. In the past six months, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement, has also extracted sixteen groups of fifty-six people to assist affiliated agencies and lower-level civil affairs departments in carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement. During this period, twenty-four groups of forty-two people were sent out to inspect work in various places or participate in meetings in various places. Now, more than one-third of the cadres are often working outside, but the daily business of the ministry is still carried out as usual. This was impossible in the past. A total of ninety-one people in the Ministry of Internal Affairs should participate in collective office work (personnel from the Personnel Department, Confidential Section, Document Section, and General Affairs Section conduct collective office work separately by department and section), but only forty or fifty people often remain in the ministry. Everyone has the opportunity to go out to participate in work or participate in various meetings. In addition, in terms of material resources, such as housing and telephones, there are more savings than in the past.

    中央内务部集体办公制度的实施
    阎熔水
    中央人民政府内务部自去年十二月十九日实行集体办公以来，工作效率大大提高。半年来的事实证明，集体办公是肃清文牍主义的有效办法。
    内务部有一厅、四司、一处、一室、十六科，共一百多个干部。过去厅、司、科都有办公室；部长、主任、司长都有小办公室。外面送内务部的公文，要经过文书科、办公厅、司、科四站，登记四次；发出的公文要登记六次。因为层层登记、核转，浪费了不少时间，工作效率不高。来文往往两天到不了承办人的手上，发文往往几天出不了部的大门。公文处理办法虽然规定一般来文要在七日内办好，但在规定时间办好的只占百分之三十九。有的来文被积压两个月甚至半年以上。各单位又因各守一角，相互联系很少，业务互不了解，一层层地转公文，写签请，拟意见，纸片乱飞。这种情况，使业务的开展受了一定的影响。
    去年十二月初反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以后，中央政法部门举办反文牍主义展览会期间，中央内务部谢觉哉部长即针对部内情况，指示实行集体办公。当时有些干部认为：“道理是对的，实行起来有困难。”有人留恋小摊子，嫌集体办公受拘束；有人耽心在实行集体办公以后，会因人多、电话多、声音嘈杂而影响工作，等等。内务部的领导同志认真考虑了上述意见之后，一面召开各种会议，展开批评和自我批评，批判各种自由散漫的思想和保守思想，教育大家认识集体办公的好处；一方面又经过研究提出了一些具体办法，如把电话集中在值班室，用电话时，要到值班室去打；在办公室周围设几个会议室，各单位开会或找人谈话时到会议室去，免得影响大家。这样就解决了某些干部的思想顾虑，并使集体办公室能够保持良好的工作秩序。
    集体办公制度实行以后，它的优点日渐显现出来。由于制度的改革，文牍主义初步克服了。在取消了厅、司、科的内收发，并成立了公文运转检查组以后，公文的收、发，只要各登记一次。原先的收发文登记簿由现在的收发文三联单所代替。即收文由文书科填写三联单，一联存文书科，一联交运转检查组，一联归档。收文由主管司负责人批办后，运转检查组直接找承办人签收，直接向承办人催查。发文由运转检查组填写三联单，一联存运转检查组，一联存文书科，一联归档，缮印、监印只在三联单上签名。这样，收文发文都由过去的四站减为两站，收文登记由四次减为一次，发文登记由六次减为一次。手续简化以后，收文一般可在两小时内送到承办人的手里；发文可以在当天发出。由于制度的改进和工作人员积极性的提高，现在一般文件五日内办好的占收文应办的百分之六十。处理公文的拖延积压现象大大减少了。
    实行集体办公后，上下级之间、各司之间的联系密切起来。以前层层核转、几天解决不了的问题，现在三言两语就可以解决。下级干部对这点特别满意。另外，工作人员可在集体办公时间集中阅览各单位发文的底稿、各地的工作报告以及部内大事记；因而加强了相互间的了解，加强了工作人员的集体观念，工作人员的业务、政策水平也得到提高。
    集体办公节省了人力和物力。收发制度的改革，使七个不必要的收发人员参加了业务工作。工作效率的提高，也使人力的必要调配成为可能。半年来内务部一面进行“三反”运动，一面又抽出十六起共五十六人协助附属机关及下级民政部门进行“三反”运动。在这期间，又为检查各地工作或参加各地会议，先后派出二十四起共四十二人。现在经常有三分之一以上的干部在外工作，而部内日常业务仍然照常进行。这在过去是不可能的。内务部应该参加集体办公的共九十一人（人事处、机要科、文书科、总务科人员，另以处、科为单位集体办公），但经常留在部内的只有四、五十人。每人都有外出参加工作或参加各种会议的机会。另外在物力方面，如房屋、电话等，都较过去节省。
