Georgi Dimitrov—Inspirer and Leader of the Bulgarian Guerrillas
By V. Georgiev, Bulgarian Writer

What title should we guerrillas give Dimitrov? Inspirer, standard-bearer, leader? Yes, he is all of these—and it can also be said: he is our comrade whom we have never met, but who is always with us in our joys, especially in moments of suffering.

Only those who have participated in anti-fascist guerrilla activities can truly understand the difficulties of fighting under our Bulgarian conditions. The most reliable condition for overcoming these difficulties is the guerrillas' great moral and political strength. This strength arises because we proudly realize that we are continuing the cause of the revolutionaries Vazov [Note 1] and Levski [Note 2]. It lies in this firm belief, in the minds of the commanders and political commissars who directly lead the troops into battle, in various political activities, and in camp life. But this is not enough. Although this struggle is a great and sacred struggle, this is not a guarantee of its victory. Even if a unit can win individual battles, this does not mean that the overall victory is certain.

There must be such a solid confidence: that the national struggle has a clever plan and leadership, that the great battle must be won, that there is a great figure who knows how to lead us forward, who knows how to lead us.

We have this kind of confidence in Dimitrov.

We trust Dimitrov because his great victory in Leipzig made everyone tremble. We trust him because he is a comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin. But our daily struggles also allow us to understand more about the wisdom and greatness of his leadership.

We will never forget the times we experienced, gathered around the guerrilla radio set somewhere in the mountains, listening to the broadcasts of the underground radio station. "Attention! Christo Botev People's Radio Station calling! He who falls in the struggle for freedom never dies!" We all perked up our ears, held our breaths, and every one of us felt our hearts pounding when we heard that powerful, majestic, and truthful voice. Everyone knew that those words were Dimitrov's greetings to us, his instructions, and there was his confidence in victory... More than one person had suggested to us that Dimitrov himself was broadcasting on the Christo Botev radio station. Many of our soldiers also believed this. In people's consciousness, Georgi Dimitrov had become a legendary hero, and his voice could only be like the voice of a radio station spokesperson.

How true and relevant were some of Dimitrov's radio instructions! For us, those instructions were a guide to action, especially when we lost contact with our headquarters.

We guerrillas of the Chavdar Detachment always complained about the lack of weapons. We had just exhausted all means to arm the soldiers, and a new batch arrived, and there would be a situation of insufficient turnover again.

In the evening, the Christo Botev radio station shouted:

"The enemy has weapons! Defeat him and arm yourselves! The struggle can be started with anything, with an awl, a knife, a pair of pliers!" The soldiers listened, and then in some people there appeared timid doubts: how can we attack the enemy with only a few pistols? But if, a few days later, we seized rich spoils and weapons almost empty-handed, then ask even the most hesitant, "Well! How do you explain this?" He would smile and answer, "Dimitrov is right!" He has learned from personal experience how true some of the words of our leader are, and he trusts him often. There is no confidence stronger than the soldier's confidence, the confidence that arises in the middle of battle...

I especially remember a morning in the autumn. The guerrillas returned from their activities. We hadn't slept all night, we were tired, and we dragged our feet along the top of the Balkan Mountains. Just as we entered the forest, we suddenly found thousands of pamphlets that had been dropped from an airplane. The soldiers were encouraged and went to pick them up to read. How happy we were! This was originally Dimitrov's essay "The Road of Bulgaria," published in the Pravda on September 14, 1943. In this essay, he profoundly pointed out that Bulgaria's road is armed resistance, and if the army participates in the struggle launched by the guerrillas, it can make the German army in Bulgaria ineffective. This essay was not only fresh news, but also our guidance and encouragement. A valuable guest has come to us here. That morning, although the soldiers were half-dead with fatigue and just wanted to fall asleep, they gathered in piles with great interest and joy to read Dimitrov's words... We distributed the printed copies of the essay we found to one village after another, and in those villages, in order to encourage and comfort the enslaved people, Dimitrov's message was secretly passed on.

In the difficult days of the spring of 1944, in the darkest days of the fascist occupation, Dimitrov gave us invaluable help. As the mobilization of the guerrillas had been carried out, the enemy became beastly in the countryside, detaining the guerrillas' relatives, burning their houses, and killing our helpers. Part of the guerrilla force was defeated by the fascist gendarmerie. The ground blockade was brutal, because for almost an entire month, May, we were always hungry, the enemy tracked our footprints, and we suffered painful losses in daily battles. Some of those guerrillas who had just come out and were not yet hard-hearted began to worry: is mobilization necessary? Haven't we already paid too many sacrifices? Under the brutal oppression of the fascists, will the frightened people stop this struggle? Then Dimitrov's name came to save us. When we earnestly told them: mobilization is being carried out according to Dimitrov's orders, they firmly endured all kinds of difficulties, hardened their hearts, and became true soldiers... Some facts also proved Dimitrov's words: the more brutal the enemy, the more intense the struggle against the enemy, and the fallen victims pulled new soldiers into our camp. By September 9, 1944, thanks to the assistance of the invincible Soviet army, victory was won.

    乔治·季米特洛夫—保加利亚游击队的鼓舞者和领袖
    保加利亚作家  维·乔格耶夫
    对于我们游击队员们说来，应给季米特洛夫怎样的称呼呢？鼓舞者，旗手，领袖？是的，他都是——还可以说：他是我们不曾见过面的，可是每天在我们欢乐的中间，尤其是在苦难的时刻，总是同我们在一起的我们的同志。
    只有参加过反法西斯的游击队活动的才会真切地体会到在我们保加利亚的条件之下进行斗争的种种困难。对付这些困难的最可靠的条件就是游击队员们巨大的道德上和政治上的力量。这种力量所以产生，因为我们骄傲地自觉到我们要把革命家伐佐夫〔注一〕和列夫斯基〔注二〕的事业继续下去。它埋伏在这坚定的信心里，埋伏在直接引导队伍进入战斗的指挥员们和政治委员们的思想里，埋伏在种种政治活动里，埋伏在军营生活里。但这是不够的。尽管这斗争是伟大的神圣的斗争，但这还不是它的胜利的保证。尽管一支队伍可以赢得个别战斗的胜利，但这还并不是说，总的胜利是确定了的。
    必须有这么一种坚实的信心：就是说全国的斗争有着精明的计划和领导，大战役一定要得胜，有一个伟大人物知道领导我们前进的方向，知道怎样来领导我们。
    对于季米特洛夫，我们有着这一种信心。
    我们信任季米特洛夫，因为他在利俾瑟的伟大的胜利曾使人人都心惊肉跳。我们信任他，因为他是伟大的斯大林的战友。但是我们日常的斗争也使我们更多地了解到他的领导的智慧和伟大。
    我们忘不掉我们所经历的那些时光，在山上一个什么地方安置着的游击队的无线电收音机周围，我们聚着倾听地下广播电台的广播。“注意！克利斯多·伐佐夫人民广播电台喊话！在争取自由的斗争中倒下去的，他决不死！”我们都尖起了耳朵，捺住了呼吸，一听到那一个有力的、威严的、真实的声音，我们每一个人都心头搏跳了。我们每一个人都知道那些话就是季米特洛夫向我们打的招呼，就是他的指令，也就在那儿有着他对胜利的信心……不止一个人曾经向我们示意，在克利斯多·伐佐夫无线电台广播的就是季米特洛夫本人。我们战士有许多人也相信这句话。在人们的意识中，乔治·季米特洛夫已经变成了传说中的英雄，而他的声音只能像广播电台的发言人的声音。
    季米特洛夫广播电台的一些指令是多么真实多么切要呵！对于我们来说，那些指令就是行动的向导，尤其是当我们跟我们的参谋本部失却联络的时候。
    我们查夫达尔队的游击队员们老是因武器缺少而叫苦。我们刚用尽办法把战士们武装好，新的一批就到来了，又复会有不够周转的情况。
    晚上，克利斯多·伐佐夫广播电台就喊话了：
    “敌人有武器！打垮他，把你们自己武装起来！斗争是用一切东西都可以开始的，用一支锥，一把小刀，一把钳子都可以！”战士们倾听着，于是在有些人中间出现了怯生生的疑惑：只有几支手枪怎么能够进攻敌人呢？但是，如果几天之后，我们几乎赤手空拳地夺到了丰富的战利品和武器，那你问一问甚至最有顾虑的吧，“哪！这怎么讲？”他就会笑嘻嘻地回答说：“季米特洛夫是正确的！”他从亲自的经验已经知道我们领袖的一些话多么真确，他就经常信任他了。再没有什么信心是比战士的信心、在战斗中间所产生的信心更坚强的……
    我特别清楚地记得一个秋天的早晨。游击队活动归来。全夜一忽儿也不曾睡过，累乏了，我们沿着巴尔干山岭的顶端拖步走。刚走进森林，我们忽然发见了几千本小册子，这是从一架飞机上投下来的。战士们鼓舞起来，便去拾来看。我们多么高兴呵！这原来是一九四三年九月十四日“真理报”上刊载过的季米特洛夫的论文“保加利亚的道路”。在这篇论文里，他深入人心地指出保加利亚的道路是武装抵抗，如果陆军参加了游击队员们所发动的斗争，那就可以使保加利亚境内的德军不起什么作用。这篇论文不但是新鲜的报道，而且是对我们的指导和鼓舞。一个贵重的客人来到我们这儿了。那早晨，战士们虽然累得半死，只想睡倒，却都兴致勃勃满心欢喜地一堆堆聚着念季米特洛夫的话句。……我们所发见的那篇论文的印本，我们分送到一个个村子，就在那些村子里，为了鼓舞和安慰被奴役的人民，秘密地传递着季米特洛夫的音讯。
    在一九四四年春天艰苦的日子，在法西斯占领时期的最黑暗的日子，季米特洛夫给予我们无限宝贵的帮助。由于游击队的动员已经贯彻下去，敌人在乡村里发作兽性了，便把游击队员的亲族们扣押起来，把他们的房屋烧掉，把我们的助手们打死。游击队的一部分被法西斯宪兵队打败了。地面的封锁是残酷的，因为几乎整整的一个月，五月，我们老挨着饿，敌人跟踪着我们的脚迹，便在日常的战斗中，使我们遭受到沉痛的损失。那些刚才出来，还算不上硬心肠的游击队员的人们有几个就发生着顾虑：动员是必须进行的么？我们可不是已经付出了太多的牺牲么？在法西斯分子的残酷压迫下，受惊受吓的人民可不会停止这个斗争的么？于是季米特洛夫的大名来挽救我们了。当我们恳切地告诉了他们：依照季米特洛夫的命令正在进行动员的时候，他们坚定地忍耐着种种的困难，硬起心肠来，变成真正的战士了……还有一些事实也证明了季米特洛夫的话：敌人愈残酷，对敌人的斗争也愈厉害，倒下去的牺牲者们把新的战士们拉引到我们的阵营里来。到一九四四年九月九日，由于不可战胜的苏联军队的援助，胜利是赢得了。
    〔注一〕伊凡·伐佐夫（一八五○—一九二一）是保加利亚解放运动的领袖之一，杰出的作家。
    〔注二〕伐西里·列夫斯基（一八三七—一八七三）是保加利亚解放运动的领袖之一，杰出的革命诗人。
