    The Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres in Fangshan Mine is Extremely Serious

    To the Editor: In the early stage of the "Three-Anti" movement, the Economy and Savings Inspection Committee of the Jingxi Mining Bureau sent a work team to the Fangshan Mine to mobilize the masses to expose corruption, waste, and bureaucratic phenomena. In just one day, workers raised more than 500 opinions on leading cadres suppressing democracy, failing to adopt rationalization proposals, and waste in production and capital construction. However, the leading cadres of Fangshan Mine did not face up to their mistakes. Deputy Director Zhao's self-criticism at the mass meeting only briefly mentioned some figures of waste, without seriously examining the causes of the waste. The masses were very dissatisfied with this kind of self-criticism, believing that it could not solve the problem. Some workers lost enthusiasm for the movement. Subsequently, after repeated mobilization by the work team and the trade union cadres of Fangshan Mine, the masses exposed many more problems. For example, the district captain abused his power, arbitrarily ordering workers to stop working, arbitrarily paying fifth-grade workers fourth-grade wages, and making skilled workers carry coal and do odd jobs; the mine's security captain even beat workers at will. The phenomenon of excluding outside workers was also extremely serious. More than 200 workers who were transferred to Fangshan Mine in 1951 have now been excluded, leaving only more than 50 people. Workers' rationalization proposals and opinions on work cannot be well adopted or answered. These problems have been reported to the Party organization and the trade union by the workers more than once in the past, but they have never been resolved. After the workers exposed them again this time, they still did not receive attention. Branch Secretary Liu Shen even shielded the district captain Zhang Youyin, whose work style was very bad. During this movement, the masses raised many opinions about Zhang Youyin, but the Party organization threw the masses' opinions into the drawer and ignored them, so the workers reacted extremely badly.

    The leading cadres of Fangshan Mine also treated the criticisms in the Party newspaper with an extremely serious bureaucratic attitude. On May 11, the Economic Life Brief Review of the People's Daily exposed and criticized the bureaucratic work style of the mine, which ignored safe production and shifted the responsibility for deaths and injuries to the workers. The leading cadres of Fangshan Mine not only never made a self-criticism to the masses, but also did not give the newspaper to the workers to read. Fangshan Mine subscribes to very few copies of the People's Daily, and usually workers go to the trade union and the club to read them. After the newspaper arrived at Fangshan Mine on this day, the masses heard that the People's Daily had criticized the leading cadres, so they searched everywhere for the People's Daily to read. However, the director of the trade union locked the newspaper in a drawer and did not allow the workers to read it. Even Li Shusheng, a worker who personally subscribed to the People's Daily, did not receive it. Therefore, the workers were very dissatisfied.

    From the above two problems, it can be seen that the thinking of the leading cadres of Fangshan Mine has not been transformed in the great "Three-Anti" movement, and the masses have not yet been truly mobilized. This situation should attract the serious attention of the Party committee and administrative leadership of the Jingxi Mining Bureau.

### 房山矿领导干部的官僚主义作风十分严重

    房山矿领导干部的官僚主义作风十分严重
    编辑同志：在“三反”运动初期，京西矿务局节约检查委员会曾派工作组到房山矿，发动群众揭发贪污浪费和官僚主义现象。仅只一天时间，工人们对领导干部压制民主、不采纳合理化建议以及生产和基本建设中的浪费等就提出了五百多条意见。但房山矿的领导干部并没有正视自己的错误。赵副矿长在群众大会上的检讨，只简单地说了一些浪费的数目字，没有认真检查造成浪费的原因。群众对这种检讨很不满意，认为不能解决问题。有的工人对运动的劲头就不大了。其后，经过工作组和房山矿的工会干部反复动员，群众又揭发了许多问题。比如，区队长滥用职权，随便命令工人停止上班，随便给五级工人开四级工人的工资，并让技术工去背煤干杂活；矿上的警卫队长甚至随便打工人。排斥外来工人的现象也极严重，一九五一年调到房山矿的二百多工人现在已被排斥得剩了五十多人了。工人的合理化建议和对工作的意见更不能很好的被采纳或得到答复。这些问题，过去工人也曾不止一次地向党组织和工会反映过，但是始终没有得到解决。这次工人又予揭发后，仍未引起重视。支部书记刘深，甚至袒护作风十分恶劣的区队长张有银。在这次运动中，群众对张有银提了很多意见，党组织却将群众的意见扔到抽屉里不过问，因此工人反映极坏。
    房山矿的领导干部同样以十分严重的官僚主义态度对待党报的批评。五月十一日，人民日报的经济生活简评揭发和批评了该矿忽视安全生产、把死伤事故的责任推到工人身上的官僚主义作风。房山矿的领导干部不但一直没有向群众作检讨，并且不把报给工人看。房山矿订的人民日报很少，平常工人都是到工会和俱乐部去看。这一天的报纸到房山矿后，群众听说人民日报对领导干部有所批评，便到处找人民日报看。但是工会主任却把报纸锁在抽屉里，不让工人看。连工人李书圣个人订的人民日报也没有收到。因此，工人们很不满意。
    从以上两个问题看，房山矿的领导干部的思想在伟大的“三反”运动中并没有得到改造，群众也还没有真正发动。这一情况应该引起京西矿务局的党委和行政领导方面的严重注意。
