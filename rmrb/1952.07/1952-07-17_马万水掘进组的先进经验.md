The Advanced Experience of Ma Wanshui's Tunneling Team
By our reporter Lin Mo

The Ma Wanshui tunneling team of the state-owned Longyan Iron Mine has seen its production performance rise steadily over the past two years, maintaining the highest monthly tunneling record in the entire mine. They tunnel in medium-hard and harder rocks, and their highest monthly advance record reached 67.4 meters. Through long-term work, the Ma Wanshui team has created a wealth of tunneling experience. According to the current level of the Longyan Iron Mine, if all tunneling teams in the mine implemented the advanced experience of the Ma Wanshui team, the tunneling efficiency of the entire mine could be increased by one to two times. Obviously, this is a major event in China's current steel production.

Ma Wanshui created various rock slotting methods

The rocks in Longyan Iron Mine are relatively complex, including quartzite, siliceous slate, phyllite, and hematite ore of varying hardness. Ma Wanshui is a skilled miner who has worked in the mine for fourteen years. Ma Wanshui is not like some old workers who always operate according to their old habits. He learns while working. After liberation, Ma Wanshui took the initiative to seek help from technicians and also studied culture himself. When he encountered problems in his work, he consulted with technicians, looked up reference books, pondered in bed at night, or studied with the people in his team in the tunnels. In short, he must find a solution. After each blasting, Ma Wanshui sought experience from the results; when the rock conditions changed, he always fired a few shots to test the nature of the rock. From long-term experience, Ma Wanshui deeply understood and mastered the principles of drilling and blasting, and became familiar with the properties of the rock. Therefore, he created scientific slotting methods based on various rocks.

Ma Wanshui's tunneling methods mainly include the following:

(1) When mining the top layer of ore (the top layer of ore in Longyan Iron Mine is about 2.5 meters thick), use the "side wedge slotting method" to slot on the upper rib (upper rib or lower rib refers to the direction of the ore layer's inclination). Drill two rows of aligned holes (four or six), with the row closer to the rib drilled straight or slightly outward, and the second row drilled inclined towards the holes closer to the rib. There are two advantages to this slotting method: first, it is easy to adjust the drill bit, and the slot is dug relatively deep; second, the second row of holes is slightly inclined downwards, which can create a larger angle with the inclined surface of the ore layer, and the blasting effect is greater. If the ore is very soft, Ma Wanshui will not drill the row of holes closer to the rib, but will use a single row of shots to dig out the same slot. If the ore is very hard, Ma Wanshui will drill a "safety hole" next to one of the holes in the second row to increase the blasting power.

(2) For hard quartzite, due to the limitations of the existing equipment conditions, it is impossible to drill deep holes. Ma Wanshui uses the method of slotting with a center wedge formed by two rows of holes on the left and right sides facing each other. Sometimes he also drills a "safety hole" next to one of the holes in the second row. If the rock is even harder, he uses the "two-hole connection, one-time blasting" method: connect the opposite holes on the left and right at the bottom of the hole, so that the gunpowder in the two holes is connected together, and use one detonator to blast at one time, concentrating the explosive force of the gunpowder (if using electric detonators, the slotting holes can be blasted simultaneously, so there is no need to connect the two holes).

(3) For soft rocks or loose rocks, Ma Wanshui implements sparse hole, deep hole operations: use two single-row holes to dig out a side wedge-shaped slot; use three holes in a triangular shape to dig out a center slot.

(4) For a kind of flaky phyllite and siliceous slate rich in bedding, if holes are drilled along the bedding of the rock, it is not only easy to jam the drill bit, but also easy to "leak air" and "draw strips" during blasting. For this kind of rock, Ma Wanshui uses the method of drilling holes through the layers, which can avoid the above problems. The larger the angle of intersection between the hole and the bedding, the better the effect.

(5) If two rocks of different hardness appear on the tunneling face at the same time, Ma Wanshui always breaks down the softer part first, creating a larger free surface for the hard rock, which makes it easier to break.

(6) Ma Wanshui can make full use of the natural joints, bedding, and fissures of the rock. He is very familiar with these weaknesses of the rock. He often uses several methods to utilize joints, bedding, and fissures: First, if there are vertical joints or fissures on the tunneling face, use them for slotting, which can save a row of slotting holes. Second, if a horizontal joint surface is found at the bottom of the slot, fewer and shallower rib holes can be drilled (drilling to 20 cm from the joint surface), using the vibration force of the blast to break the rock from the joint. Third, if the combination line between the bottom plate and the ore is in a suitable place on the tunneling face (not too high or too low), Ma Wanshui uses the combination line as a row of holes for horizontal slotting operations.

Advanced technology cannot be separated from advanced labor organization

In order to implement rapid tunneling, it is not enough for the tunneling team to have good drilling and blasting techniques. It must also have an advanced and scientific labor organization. Otherwise, advanced technology will not be able to fully play its role.

The Ma Wanshui team tunnels in a single-lane tunnel. The work process includes drilling, blasting, hauling slag, and cleaning the working face. This is a production cycle. This is much more complicated than cyclical tunneling in multi-lane tunnels, where the tunneling workers do not care about the loading and transportation situation. The ventilation time in Longyan Iron Mine is limited. Within each eight-hour work shift, ventilation is only provided twice for five hours, that is, two and a half hours each time, with an hour and a half in between. The tunneling workers carry out loading and transportation work during the ventilation stop. In this case, if the work is not well organized and the wind power cannot be fully utilized for drilling during the ventilation time, then, although the collapsed slag is not much, the loading and transportation time may be prolonged, which will affect the drilling work during the second ventilation. According to actual measurements, the wind power utilization rate of general tunneling teams in Longyan Iron Mine is only about 50%, and they can only fire one shot during a ventilation time; while the wind power utilization rate of the Ma Wanshui team reaches 91.55%, and they can fire two shots during a ventilation time.

Why can the Ma Wanshui team do this? This is by no means due to their simply seizing the time and blindly increasing the labor intensity, but because they can meticulously arrange and allocate the work of the entire team, with plans for everything, everyone has a specific responsibility, the work is orderly, reducing certain extra operations, using the strength in important places, so that every bit of labor can get more value. They also pay attention to improving tools and improving operating techniques. The specifics are reflected in the following points:

First, implement cross-operation in the work. The most obvious is the arrangement of drilling, loading cannons, and preparing for blasting. General teams have five people per shift, three people use one wind machine to drill, one person carries and changes drill bits, and one person leads the cannon medicine and prepares cannon soil. Their labor force is surplus. But they always load the cannons after drilling, and only then prepare for blasting. In this way, there are thirty to forty minutes between drilling and blasting. The Ma Wanshui team is not like this. They have seven people per shift, six people use two wind machines to drill, and one person carries drill bits. They draw two wind machine workers from the two wind machines to load the cannons ten minutes before the end of drilling; the drill bit carrier simultaneously starts preparing for blasting: tidying up the drill bits, lighting carbide lamps, and removing electric lamps and wires. After the drilling is finished, the two drillers help load the last few cannons; the two wind machine workers and the drill bit carrier continue to prepare for blasting: evacuate the wind machine and wind belt, and take charge of security. In this way, only a few minutes after the drilling is finished, the blasting can be carried out. According to the actual measurement record of the Ma Wanshui team on May 27, it only took six minutes and fifteen seconds from the end of drilling to the blasting. Due to the cross-operation, thirty-five minutes and twenty seconds were shortened. If the cross-operation is not carried out, the wind power will be ineffective during this time, and people will not be idle.

Second, closely cooperate in the work and improve operating techniques. Their movements to change drill bits during drilling are very fast. This small and rapid operation is completed by the joint efforts of three people: 1. The drill bit carrier pre-arranges the drill bits according to length and thickness next to the driller, so that he can easily get the appropriate drill bit. 2. The wind machine worker pays attention to adding oil to the wind machine's tiger mouth, so that the driller can easily remove the old drill bit. 3. The driller pays attention to reducing certain unreasonable movements. They only need an average of 21 seconds to change a drill bit; while other teams need an average of 51 seconds to change a drill bit. When drilling quartzite, they have to change drill bits eighty or ninety times a day, so accelerating this small operation process can save a lot of time. For example, when changing hole positions, the drillers in other teams always have to stop, measure the angle and depth of the previous hole, and consider the position of the next hole. Ma Wanshui always looks at the position of the next hole when drilling the previous hole, so he changes the hole position very quickly; he waits until he has opened a new hole before using one hand to measure the angle and depth of the previous hole, which does not affect the drilling work.

Third, improved loading tools. They use iron plates, iron shovels, and temporary tracks when loading, which is one to two times faster than other teams who use iron dustpans to load. Although they break down a lot of slag, they can load the slag during the ventilation stop without affecting the next drilling work.

Fourth, good preparation work. Ma Wanshui always goes to work one or two hours before the shift. After taking over the shift, he immediately carries out the preparation work according to the division of labor: the squad leader and safety officer check the roof and specifications; the drill bit carrier goes to the drill bit room to get drill bits, collects materials, and prepares cannon soil; one person collects gunpowder and detonating cords; one person stores tools; two wind machine workers oil the wind machine and pull the wind belt separately. Before the wind comes, everything is ready. When the wind comes, they pick up the wind machine and start drilling. Based on the principles of safety and ease of use, they classify tools and place them in appropriate locations, with dedicated personnel in charge of custody and delivery. Therefore, they rarely experience finding tools, waiting for materials, and various work disruptions due to chaotic order and unclear responsibilities during their work.

Many of the above facts show that the reason why Ma Wanshui can organize the work well is because he has implemented the principles of specific responsibility and division of labor and cooperation into every detail of the entire work. In each stage of the tunneling work - handover, preparation, drilling, loading cannons, blasting, loading, cleaning the working face - they have carefully divided the work. In the eight-hour work, who does what at what time, how they cooperate with each other, everyone is very clear, and everyone's activities are carried out like flowing water according to the order of work. This has formed a natural law. Therefore, when the Ma Wanshui team is working, there are few phenomena of the team leader or class leader temporarily assigning work. They use certain sign language for some necessary operation commands.

The Ma Wanshui team plans and allocates work very appropriately, and there are no phenomena of tightness and looseness, unevenness of importance in the work. Everyone's labor expenditure is very uniform in a day's work, and everyone can carry out the work competently and happily. Therefore, in their team, workers' injury and sick leave are the least.

The Ma Wanshui team is a good example of mine labor organization. Their work rules provide important principles for implementing production chart management system in mine tunnel operations under existing conditions.

Sound small group management system

The Ma Wanshui team's three-shift production is progressing steadily in a balanced state. This has a lot to do with their handover system. When handing over shifts, first, they must hand over the cleaned working face; second, they must hand over intact tools. Damaged tools must be handed over to the repair department for repair, and missing tools must be collected; third, they must explain the safety situation and the experience of the work of the shift. The general spirit is that the shift should do its best to help the next shift do a good job. In addition to taking care of the three shifts, the team leader Ma Wanshui also focuses on helping in one shift, and after gaining experience, he immediately promotes it in the other two shifts.

In each shift, there are dedicated personnel responsible for safety, attendance rate, and checking the implementation of the patriotic pact. The patriotic pact is the driving force for promoting work. The entire Ma Wanshui team and everyone regularly stipulate the guarantee conditions for work on the patriotic pact.

The Ma Wanshui team often conducts criticism and self-criticism, which is a guarantee that various systems can be implemented. Their entire team holds a production inspection meeting every Saturday. In addition to checking the work of the week and arranging the work of the next week, the main thing is to promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The mutual criticism among workers is very strict and sharp. Everyone starts from work, is responsible for the work, and anyone who has made a mistake in the work will be criticized. When criticizing and reviewing important issues, Ma Wanshui first studies with the class leaders and activists in advance, and educates everyone through in-depth criticism of a certain event or a certain person. Why are everyone in the Ma Wanshui team so serious, serious, and orderly at work? Carrying out criticism and self-criticism is a very important condition.

    马万水掘进组的先进经验
    本报记者  林沫
    国营龙烟铁矿马万水掘进组，两年多以来，生产成绩直线上升，月月保持着全矿最高的掘进纪录。他们在中硬和中硬以上的岩石中掘进，最高月进纪录达到六十七点四公尺。马万水组在长期的工作中创造了丰富的掘进经验。按照龙烟铁矿目前的水平，如果全矿的掘进组都实行了马万水组的先进经验，那末，全矿的掘进效率可以提高一倍到两倍。显然，这是我国当前钢铁生产上的一件大事。
    马万水创造了多种岩石的掏槽方法
    龙烟铁矿的岩石是比较复杂的，有石英岩、矽质板岩、千页岩及软硬不同的赤铁矿石。马万水是一个熟练矿工，已在矿坑里工作了十四年。马万水不像某些老工友那样，总是根据自己的老习惯进行操作。他是一面工作，一面学习。在解放以后，马万水主动地取得技术人员的帮助，自己也学习了文化。他在工作中遇到了问题，就请教技术人员，翻参考书，夜晚睡在床上琢磨，或在坑道中和组里的人一起研究。总之，一定要找出解决的办法。马万水在每次爆破之后，都要从效果中找取经验；遇到石头的情况发生变化，他总是先放几炮试试岩石的性质。马万水从长期的经验中，深刻地体会和掌握了打眼、放炮的原理，熟悉了岩石的性质，因此，根据各种不同的岩石，创造了科学的掏槽方法。
    马万水的掘进方法主要有以下几种。
    （一）打头层矿（龙烟铁矿的头层矿约有二点五公尺厚）使用“旁楔形掏槽法”，把槽子掏在偏上帮（上帮或下帮是指矿层的倾斜方向来说的）。打上两排对列的眼（四个或六个），靠帮的一排打成直眼或稍向外斜，第二排眼向靠帮的眼倾斜着打。这样掏槽有两个好处：第一，容易调开钎子，槽子掏的比较深；第二，第二排眼略向下斜，可以和矿层的倾斜面造成更大的角度，爆破效果就更大。若是矿石很软，马万水就不打靠帮的一排眼，而用单排炮掏出同样的槽子。若是矿石很硬，马万水就在靠第二排一个眼的旁边，再打一个“保险眼”，加大爆破威力。
    （二）对坚硬的石英岩，因受现有的设备条件的限制，打不成深眼，马万水使用左右两排炮对卡的中间楔形掏槽的办法。有时他还在靠第二排一个眼的旁边，打一个“保险眼”。如果石头更硬，他就用“两眼贯通、一次爆破”的办法：把左右相对的两个眼在孔底打通，使两个眼的火药联在一起，用一个雷管，一次爆破，使火药的爆炸力集中（若使用电雷管，可以使掏槽眼同时爆破，就不必两眼贯通）。
    （三）对软岩石或疏松的岩石，马万水就实行稀眼、深孔作业：用单排两个眼掏出一个旁楔形的槽子；用成三角形的三个眼掏出一个中心槽。
    （四）有一种成薄片的千页岩和层理丰富的矽质板岩，如果顺着石头的层理打眼，不但容易卡钎子，爆破时还容易“泄气”、“抽条”。对这种岩石，马万水使用穿层打眼的办法，这就可以避免上述的毛病。这种方法，眼和层理构成的交叉角度愈大，效果就愈好。
    （五）如果掘进面上同时出现软硬不同的两种岩石，马万水总是先把较软的部分打下来，给硬石头造成更大的自由面，也就容易打了。
    （六）马万水能够充分利用岩石的自然节理、层理和裂隙。他对岩石的这些弱点是非常熟悉的。他经常使用几种利用节理、层理和裂隙的办法：一、出现在掘进面的竖的节理或裂隙，就利用它进行掏槽，可以省去一排掏槽眼。二、在槽底发现横的节理面，就可以少打和打浅的帮眼（打到距节理面二十公分处），利用爆破的震动力，从有节理的地方把石头崩下来。三、如果底板和矿石的结合线处在掘进面的适当地方（不过高或过低），马万水就利用结合线当一排眼，进行横掏槽作业。
    先进的技术离不开先进的劳动组织
    掘进组为了实行快速掘进，光有良好的打眼、放炮的技术是不行的。它还必须有先进的、科学的劳动组织。否则，先进的技术也就不能充分发挥它的作用。
    马万水组是在单孔道掘进的。工作的进程包括打眼、放炮、运碴和清理工作面。这是一个生产周期。这就比在多孔道实行循环掘进时，掘进工不管装运的情况要复杂得多。龙烟铁矿送风的时间是有限制的，在每班八小时的工作时间内，只能分两次送风五小时，即每次送风两个半小时，中间停一个半小时。掘进工就在停风时进行装运工作。在这种情况下，如果工作组织得不好，不能在送风时间充分利用风力打眼，那末，崩下的碴虽然不多，装运的时间还可能拖长，一直会影响到第二次送风时的打眼工作。根据实际测定，龙烟铁矿一般掘进组对风力的使用率只有百分之五十左右，在一次送风时间内，只能放一次炮；而马万水组对风力的使用率达到百分之九十一点五五，他们能在一次送风时间内放两次炮。
    马万水组为什么能够作到这样呢？这绝不是由于他们单纯地抓紧时间，盲目地加强劳动强度，而是由于他们能够精细地安排和分配全组的工作，事事有计划，人人有专责，工作有秩序，减少了某些额外的操作活动，把力量使用在要紧的地方，使每一点劳动力都能获得更多的代价。他们并注意改进工具，提高操作技术。具体的表现在以下几点：
    第一，在工作中实行交叉作业。最明显的是打眼、装炮、准备放炮三种工作的安排。别的组一般都是五个人一班，三个人使用一台风机打眼，一个人扛换钎，一个人领炮药和准备炮土。他们的劳动力是有富余的。但他们总是在打完眼之后，由掌钎工来装炮，炮装好以后，才进行放炮的准备工作。这样，从打完眼到放炮，中间这一段有三、四十分钟的时间。马万水组不是这样。他们每班七个人，六个人使用两台风机打眼，一人扛钎。他们在打眼结束前十几分钟，就从两台风机上抽出两个抱风机工去装炮；扛钎工同时开始进行放炮的准备工作：收拾钎子，点电石灯，撤电灯、电线。打完了眼，两个掌钎工帮助装上最后的几个炮；两个抱风机工就和扛钎工继续进行放炮的准备工作：撤出风机、风带，担任警戒。这样打完眼之后，不过几分钟，就可以放炮了。根据五月二十七日在马万水组实际测定的记录，他们从打完眼到放炮，中间只有六分十五秒。由于进行交叉作业，缩短了三十五分二十秒。如果不进行交叉作业，这一段时间的风力就失去作用，而人并没有闲着。
    第二，在工作中密切配合，改进操作技术。他们打眼时换钎子的动作非常快，这个细小的迅速的操作，是由三个人合力完成的：一、扛钎工预先把钎子按长短和粗细摆在掌钎工旁边，使他随手就可以拿到合适的钎子。二、抱风机工注意在风机老虎咀上加油，使掌钎工很容易取下旧钎子。三、掌钎工注意减少某些不合理的动作。他们换一次钎子，平均只要二十一秒；而别的组换一次钎子，平均要五十一秒钟。在打石英岩时，一天要换八、九十次钎子，所以，加速这个小的操作过程，可以节省许多时间。再如：其他组的掌钎工在换孔位时，总是要停下来，量前一个眼的角度和深度，考虑下一个眼的位置。而马万水总是在打前一个眼时，就看好了下一个眼的位置，因此，换孔位很快；他是等到开了新眼之后，再用一只手量前一个眼的角度和深度，并不影响打眼工作。
    第三，改进了装车工具。他们在装车时使用铁板、铁锹和临时轨道，比其他组使用铁簸箕装车的时间，要快一倍到两倍。他们崩下的石碴虽多，也能在停风时间把碴装完，不致影响下一次打眼工作。
    第四，准备工作做的好。马万水总是在接班前一、二十分钟上班，接班后，即按各人的分工进行准备工作：班长和安全员检查顶板及规格；扛钎工到钎子房取钎子，领材料，准备炮土；一人领取火药及导火线；一人存放工具；两个抱风机工分别给风机上油，拉风带。风来之前，一切准备就绪，等风来了，抱起风机就开始打眼。他们根据安全和使用方便的原则，把工具分类放置在适当的地点，各有专人保管和取送。所以，他们在工作中很少因秩序混乱和职责不明而发生找工具、等材料和各种工作脱节的现象。
    以上很多事实说明，马万水所以能把工作组织好，是因为他把专责制和分工合作的原则，贯彻到全部工作的每一个细节中。他们在掘进工作的每一个阶段中——交接班、准备工作、打眼、装炮、放炮、装车、清理工作面，都细致地分了工。在八小时的工作中，谁在什么时候干什么活，彼此之间怎样配合，人人都非常明确，每人的活动都随着工作的顺序流水似地进行着。这已形成一个自然的规律。所以，当马万水组工作的时候，很少发生组长或班长临时分配工作的现象。他们对于某些必要的操作指挥，都是使用一定的手语。
    马万水组把工作计划得和分配得非常的适当，工作中没有忽紧忽松、轻重不等的现象。每人在一天的工作中，劳力支出非常匀称，大家都能胜任愉快地进行工作。所以，在他们组里，工人的伤、病假是最少的。
    马万水组是矿山劳动组织的一个良好的榜样。他们的工作规律，对矿山坑道作业在现有条件下实行生产图表管理制，提供了重要的原则。
    健全的小组管理制度
    马万水组三班生产都是在平衡的状态下稳步前进的。这和他们的交接制度有很大关系。他们在交接班时，第一，要交出清理好的工作面；第二，要交出完好的工具，坏工具要负责交给修理部门修好，缺少的工具要负责领到；第三，要交代安全情况和本班工作的经验。总的精神都是本班要尽力帮助下班把工作搞好。组长马万水除了照顾三班外，还在一个班里进行重点帮助，取得经验之后，马上在其他两班推广。
    他们每班中，都有专人负责安全、出勤率和检查爱国公约的执行情况。爱国公约是推动工作的动力，马万水全组和每一个人都定期把对工作的保证条件订在爱国公约上。
    马万水组经常进行批评和自我批评，这是使各种制度能贯彻执行的保证。他们全组每星期六开一次检查生产的会议。会中，除检查本周工作和布置下周工作外，主要的就是发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。工人们相互之间的批评是非常严格和尖锐的，每一个人都从工作出发，对工作负责，任何人在工作中有了过失，都要受到批评。对于重要的问题进行批评和检讨时，马万水事先都和各班班长及积极分子先研究好，通过对某一件事或某一个人的深刻批评来教育大家。为什么马万水组在工作时人人都那么认真、严肃和有秩序呢？开展批评和自我批评是一个十分重要的条件。
