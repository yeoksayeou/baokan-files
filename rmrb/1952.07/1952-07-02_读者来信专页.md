	Ma Hengchang Workshop Workers Greet the Party's Birthday with "July 1st" Red Flag Competition

	Respected Chairman Mao: The Party's birthday has arrived. All the workers of our Ma Hengchang Workshop report to you with extreme excitement: we have completed all the production tasks for the first half of the year forty-three days ahead of schedule on May 7th. The quality reached 98%, and the cost was reduced by 6.6%. Our production efficiency has been increasing. Last year, we produced nine machines per month, and now we produce eighteen precision machine tool components per month, doubling the output compared to last year.

	Chairman Mao, the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have further enhanced our class consciousness. We responded to Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and save eight million tons of grain with practical actions. We have set a plan to increase production and save 5,500 tons of grain, and strive to over fulfill it. We have fully studied and promoted advanced production experiences such as high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-edge, and nesting. The entire workshop has found a total of 669 tricks. In the two weeks of formulating the plan, we have already implemented 84 kinds of tricks. Wang Hongfu increased the speed of making copper fixed friction plates from 60 revolutions in the past to 1,200 revolutions, and the cutting speed increased from 375 meters to 980 meters. He Wancai uses a knife with four edges to machine the hat, completing it in one go without turning the tool holder, increasing efficiency by one and a half times. Miller Liu Chunzhe mills long shafts, clamping two at the same time and accelerating the feed rate, increasing from four pieces a day to twenty-four pieces a day. Jin Qingzhi makes clutch jaw seats, changing to a multi-fixture operation method, increasing from clamping three together in the past to clamping twenty together, increasing efficiency by two times. Wang Zhanxue makes the main shaft sleeve of 106 cm in diameter and 496 cm in length. In the past, drilling was used for processing, resulting in all the material in the middle becoming iron filings. Now, the nesting method is used, and a 30 cm diameter and 1-meter long raw material is extracted from it.

	Chairman Mao: Our lives have also gradually improved on the basis of developing production. The average salary of all workers in the workshop has increased by 65% compared to last year. Each of us has made more than two sets of new clothes, and every worker can eat 75% of refined grain. Our factory's bathhouse, nursery, children's school, recreation room, and library have been established. Among the fourteen illiterate people, nine can read newspapers and write simple letters. We all clearly know that all these are brought to us by you.

	In order to greet the 31st anniversary of our Party, our workshop is actively conducting "quality make-up lessons" and formulating plans to improve quality; at the same time, we are also actively preparing to promote the advanced experience of organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts. Our workshop has launched the "July 1st" Red Flag competition to ensure improved product quality, over-fulfill the national production plan and the increase production and conservation plan. We will always follow you and closely unite under your banner, without arrogance or complacency, continue to move forward, and strive to realize a beautiful socialist and communist society!

	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
	All the workers of the Ma Hengchang Workshop, Factory No. 15, Northeast Machinery Industry Bureau

	Ma Liuhaizi Excavation Team Workers Respond to the Call for Increased Production and Conservation and Propose Four Guarantees

	Respected Chairman Mao: All the workers of our Datong Coal Mine's Ma Liuhaizi Rapid Excavation Team greet the 31st anniversary of the Party with excitement and determination to defend peace.

	Since liberation three years ago, under your and the Party's wise leadership and education, we have improved our class consciousness and created new achievements in several production competition movements, accumulating wealth for the country. After the great "Three-Anti" movement, our class consciousness and production enthusiasm have been further enhanced. Everyone said: "In the past, things produced were pocketed by corrupt elements; now, one more produced counts as one more!" Under the slogan of "Hunt tigers above ground, produce below ground," we completed our monthly production tasks ahead of schedule and over fulfilled them.

	Dear Chairman Mao: In the old society, we were "coal blacks" who lived like cattle and horses; now, under your and the Party's leadership, we have gained happiness. Our work is guaranteed, and our lives are improving day by day. Everyone in our team has a watch, and six people have bought bicycles. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, there is unspeakable joy in our hearts!

	In the vigorous patriotic safety competition movement, our team has responded to your call for "increasing production and conservation" with practical actions. We have full confidence in completing this year's tasks for increasing production and conservation, and at the same time guarantee to do the following things well:

	1. Guarantee to improve the excavation progress and strive to reach 700 meters by the end of August. Ensure that the roadways are neat and meet standard specifications.
	2. Further improve the deep-hole drilling method, reaching a drilling depth of 1.8 meters. Learn the chart management system well. Study the business and master operating techniques.
	3. Strengthen political, cultural, and current affairs studies. Live a good democratic life and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Hold two technical research meetings every week to continuously improve technical level.
	4. Strictly abide by labor discipline. Continue to ensure safe production, without deaths or serious injuries, and reduce minor injuries. Take care of tools and reduce costs by 10%.

	All the workers of the Datong Coal Mine's Ma Liuhaizi Rapid Excavation Team

	The People of the Jinggang Mountains Guarantee "Promoting Revolutionary Tradition and Striving for Greater Glory"

	Respected Chairman Mao: The great "July 1st" has arrived. We, the people of the Jinggang Mountains, are writing to report to you on the situation of this year's patriotic production increase movement and put forward future guarantees.

	Last August, the visiting delegation you sent brought us great encouragement. We overcame various difficulties and won a great victory on the production front, achieving the biggest harvest on the mountain in sixty years. The living standards of the people have improved significantly. Nearly every household in the area of 704 households made new clothes. A number of model figures emerged in the production movement, such as Zou Guizhang, a poor peasant from Dajing Township, and Luo Longmao, a poor peasant from Xiazhuang Township, who were elected as county labor models; and Li Yulan, Liu Bingsheng and other nine people were elected as district labor models, which established production banners in the county and district and promoted the patriotic production increase movement. Now, the four townships in the district have organized a permanent mutual aid team, forty-three seasonal mutual aid teams, and fifteen patriotic high-yield groups; repaired 249 water canals and 134 water weirs; opened 198 mu of wasteland; and accumulated 7,382,360 jin of fertilizer.

	We propose the following guarantees as a gift to celebrate "July 1st": 1. Do a good job in weeding, ensuring three weedings and three hoeings; 2. Do a good job in preventing beasts, insects, drought, and floods, ensuring intensive cultivation and striving to increase production by 20% on the basis of last year's production; 3. Rectify and consolidate existing mutual aid teams, ensuring that 30% of the labor force is organized; 4. Continue to carry out the patriotic production increase and fertilizer accumulation movement, guaranteeing to complete the task of accumulating 1,000 jin of fertilizer per person; 5. Guarantee to engage in sideline occupations during the slack season to solve difficulties in production; 6. Guarantee to carry out the patriotic health movement, mobilizing every household, getting everyone involved, keeping everything clean, and ensuring everyone's health. We will always remember your instruction to "promote revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and under the leadership of the Party and the working class, we will fight to the end for the construction of a great motherland and the defense of world lasting peace. We wish you good health and longevity!

	All the people of the Jinggang Mountains

	Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Reports on Production Situation

	Respected Chairman Mao: The glorious and great 31st anniversary of the Communist Party of China -- the "July 1st" memorial day has arrived again, and we are truly extremely happy. The children in the cooperative are singing songs commemorating "July 1st" and "The East is Red" loudly. Chairman Mao: When celebrating the Party's birthday, when we think about the past and compare it to the present, we feel unspeakable joy after all the suffering. Under your and the Party's call to "organize," we have been collectively helping each other in production since 1943, turning our village from a poor gully into a rich gully. Today, among the 26 households in our production cooperative, 25 households have surplus grain, and every family has begun a happy life. We have deeply experienced that we cannot live well for a day without you; following you can we embark on even happier days.

	Respected Chairman Mao: We are determined to use practical actions to complete the summer patriotic production increase competition plan to support industrial construction, consolidate national defense, and continue to strengthen the forces against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to greet the great birthday of the Party. In order to ensure the completion of the summer competition plan, we must universally hoe the autumn fields once before "July 1st," do a good job in preventing drought, eliminating insects, and protecting seedlings, prepare fertilizer for topdressing, and buy 50 sheep to accumulate fertilizer and repair 10 mu of beach land, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops. All our members and the farmers of Xigou Village have jointly formulated a three-year construction plan. This plan is based on the spirit of the People's Government's instructions to strengthen the construction of old revolutionary base areas, combined with our actual situation of "more mountains and less land," and democratically formulated. The plan mainly proposes to start from increasing the yield per unit area, repairing beach land, turning dry land into paddy fields, and developing forestry and animal husbandry on a large scale. We have calculated the accounts. After completing the three-year production and construction plan, by 1954, each person in the village can earn 8 shi and 8 dou and 4 sheng of fine grain, exceeding the income of 1951 by 134.9%. At that time, our lives will have even greater changes. Chairman Mao: We will resolutely move forward in the direction of agricultural collectivization you have pointed out and strive for a more happy and fulfilling life in the future! I wish you eternal good health!

	Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group Guarantees to Complete Patriotic Production Increase Plan

	Respected Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership, our lives have improved, and we have formed a model mutual aid group for high cotton production. The birthday of the Communist Party is coming, and we report to you with unparalleled excitement about several things in our mutual aid group and the whole village.

	First, let's talk about the situation of our mutual aid group: since we responded to your great call to "increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and jointly launched a patriotic production increase challenge competition to cotton farmers across the country, the enthusiasm of the whole group has been very high, and spring production competitions have exceeded the plan in every aspect. After the end of spring production, our group formulated a summer cotton field management plan. Our group's cotton fields began to be irrigated on June 5th and the second irrigation was done on the 12th. Before the second irrigation, we universally applied topdressing fertilizer to the cotton fields. The third irrigation was done on the 19th. Next, we carried out the first "taking off pants" (removing a part of the leaves in the lower part of the cotton seedlings) in the cotton fields. A few days ago, we also treated cotton aphids once. This year, our group's cotton seedlings are very good, with green branches and leaves, growing strong, and are now eight or nine inches tall.

	Secondly, let's talk about the situation in our village: Our Quzhuangtou Village is very different this year from the past. Our village had only two mutual aid groups last year, but now it has developed to 44 groups. The labor force and households organized account for more than 80% of the village. This spring, Qu Yaoli has taught techniques to various mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in the village three times; everyone is convinced of the method of applying more fertilizer and densely planting cotton seedlings and advanced scientific techniques. In the 2,351 mu of cotton fields in the village, more than 95% were plowed once before sowing, and 70% of the households implemented warm water soaking and medicated seed dressing. Fengzhuangtou Natural Village had no habit of soaking and dressing seeds in the past. After listening to Qu Yaoli's explanation of the benefits of soaking and dressing seeds, they also began to do so this year. The experience of applying more fertilizer and densely planting has also been promoted in our village. This year, our village's 676.5 mu of paddy cotton fields have retained an average of 3,000 seedlings per mu. Our village has also made achievements in the drought prevention and resistance movement. Originally, we planned to dig 65 wells, but now we have dug 67 wells, exceeding the plan by 2 wells, and we plan to dig 4 more wells. This spring, we also added more than 40 waterwheels. This has laid the foundation for this year's production increase.

	Respected Chairman Mao: A big river without water dries up the small ditch; without a country, there is no home. The cotton farmers in our group and our village all understand this truth. Therefore, we warmly respond to every call of the government. This spring, when the government called for pre-selling cotton, our group took the lead in responding and promoted the whole village, pre-selling more than 44,000 jin in less than three days, over fulfilling the task. Today, the patriotic production increase competition has been fully launched in our village. A total of 28 mutual aid groups in the village have participated in the competition. The number of households participating in the competition has reached more than 61% of the total number of households in the village. The Guan Jingyi group and Liu Pingzhi group in our village have also selected one mu of high-yield land and want to produce 1,000 jin of seed cotton. Everyone's enthusiasm for the competition is very high. At present, the production increase competition in the whole village is still continuing. Respected Chairman Mao: Please rest assured that our mutual aid group and our village's patriotic production increase plan for this year will definitely be successfully completed! I wish you eternal health! Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group, Quzhuangtou Village, Jiexian County, Shanxi

	All Youth League Members of the Volunteer Army's "Yang Gensi Hero Company"
	Report on the Development of the Savings Movement and the Fight Against Bacterial Warfare

	Respected Chairman Mao: In order to respond to your great call to "increase production and practice thrift," our company launched a savings movement and formulated a savings plan for 1952. The slogan of our Youth League members is: "Do not waste a bullet or a grain of food, and realize Chairman Mao's great call with exemplary leading role." Our entire company has saved wealth worth 48,735,500 yuan for the country. In order to prevent every grain of food from our motherland from being wasted, we sew up the broken grain bags every time we receive grain; when we see spilled grain on the road, we patiently pick it up one by one.

	At 8:00 pm on March 5th this year, American aerial bandits scattered a lot of germ-carrying fleas, mosquitoes, flying ants, and insects we had never seen before in our駐地, with an average of 30 to 40 per square meter. After the doctor's examination, we knew that these were bacterial poisonous insects scattered by the American aggressors. We were all very angry and immediately launched a fight against bacterial warfare. We organized four groups to burn and extinguish all the bacterial poisonous insects scattered by the enemy in time. We also made more than 400 rat-killing tools and 200 fly swatters. Each of us has several tools to extinguish poisonous insects.

	We feel infinite anger at the crime of the U.S. imperialists attempting to destroy mankind with bacterial warfare. We know that since the enemy's planes and cannons have failed, the enemy's conspiracy to scatter poisonous insects will also fail! When we saw in the newspapers that the people of our motherland and the people of the world opposed the bacterial warfare of the U.S. aggressors and actively supported us in smashing the enemy's bacterial warfare, we were all so excited that we jumped up. We must do a good job in epidemic prevention and strive for a complete victory on the epidemic prevention front!

	Now, we are conducting military training in front of the enemy in order to further improve tactics and techniques and be ready to eliminate any enemy who dares to invade. Every comrade knows that "Only by improving our skills can we win greater victories!"

	Respected Chairman Mao: We guarantee to continue to work hard, carry forward the heroic and tenacious fighting style of hero company commander Yang Gensi, and under the leadership of the Party, unite and lead the masses to complete all the tasks assigned by the superiors. I wish you good health!

	All Youth League Members of the "Yang Gensi Hero Company"

	"The Path of Light is Taken Step by Step, and the Scenery of the Whole Village is Renewed Day by Day!"
	--Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative Reports Production Achievements to Chairman Mao

	Respected Chairman Mao: The Chinese Communist Party's birthday -- the 31st anniversary of "July 1st" is coming. All the members of our production cooperative are writing this letter to you with excitement and joy, reporting some of the situations before and after the establishment of our agricultural production cooperative.

	Chairman Mao: Since you led us to turn over, we have become the masters of this large black land. Since 1947, we have been following the path of "organization" that you have pointed out to us, implementing mutual assistance and cooperation, and launching a large-scale production movement. In the past five years, we have implemented collective labor and quickly developed production. The land in the whole village has expanded from 24 hectares to more than 40 hectares. The yield per mu in 1951 was 315 jin, an increase of 103.3% compared to before liberation. We have added 24 fat horses and seven brand new rubber-wheeled carts and accumulated more than 100 million yuan in public property. Young women are wearing colorful clothes, and every family is living a prosperous life. The six bachelors in the village who could not marry a wife in the old society are now married freely and are happily working in pairs. Everyone is also very enthusiastic about studying. Young, middle-aged, and old people are learning culture in agricultural schools; a new atmosphere has emerged in the whole village.

	Because our village has a good foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation, everyone has a habit of collective labor and has the strong leadership of the Baoan Village Party Branch, so we established an agricultural production cooperative in February this year. The process of establishing the agricultural production cooperative is also the process of improving our awareness. In this process, everyone launched a struggle between new and old ideas. Take land shares as an example. The vast majority of team members advocated keeping half a mu of vegetable land for each person, and all the remaining land would be used as shares, cultivated uniformly, and distributed grain uniformly. However, Lao Zhangtou disagreed, because he accumulated more manure every year, the land was fertile, and he produced more grain than others. He advocated that when sending manure this year, everyone should still send it to their own land, just in case the cooperative collapsed, so that he could withdraw the land. This opinion was criticized by everyone. Even his son, Zhang Jichen, questioned him: "Will things led by the Communist Party collapse?" Other members also said: "To establish a cooperative, everyone must be of one mind and not half-hearted." In this way, Lao Zhangtou was persuaded and put all his land into the cooperative. When commenting on the value of carts and horses for shares, a battle of ideas was also aroused when evaluating the value of Chang Shugui's carts and horses. Chang Shugui is a prosperous middle peasant. He was not very willing to put his carts and horses into shares. He thought: He had a complete set of carts and horses and two laborers. Without relying on land, he could live a good life by just pulling carts. Therefore, he only planned to invest land, but he was embarrassed to say it publicly. When evaluating the value of his carts and horses, he insisted on his own opinion, saying that his rubber-wheeled cart was 80% new and worth 13 million yuan, and he also said: "I won't invest if it's less than that." Niu Defang and Gao Chenghe saw through his thoughts and strictly criticized his selfish and self-interested thinking. That night, Chang Shugui didn't close his eyes. He asked his wife, Zhang Suyun, what to do. Zhang Suyun firmly advocated investing carts and horses into shares. The next day, a family meeting was held under the chairmanship of Zhang Suyun, and the whole family criticized him. His father said, "Could we have bought a rubber-wheeled cart without the mutual aid team lending us 5.5 million yuan of public funds?" Zhang Suyun also said, "We relied on the mutual aid team to get carts and horses; the mutual aid team is going to move forward, which is also to produce better for us. How can we go back? How can you be worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao if you do that?" Chang Shugui thought it over and over, woke up, and felt that his approach was wrong, so he admitted his mistake to everyone. Our production cooperative was established smoothly in this way by overcoming various selfish and self-interested thoughts.

	Chairman Mao: When the agricultural production cooperative was first established, some members were not confident in this year's plan to increase grain production by an average of 1,280 jin per hectare compared to last year. But judging from spring plowing to now, everyone has changed this idea. Chi Dianwen said, "We are sure to increase production by more than 2,000 jin than last year!" Because this year, the land has been universally deep-plowed to seven inches, one inch deeper than last year; all the land has been covered with manure, 15 more carts per hectare than last year, and 5 more carts than the original plan. "One does not grow wiser without going through something," we have seen more advantages of the agricultural production cooperative than the mutual aid group in all aspects since its establishment. Everyone understands that individual farming cannot keep up with the mutual aid group, and the mutual aid group cannot keep up with the agricultural production cooperative. Individual farming is like an ox cart, the mutual aid group is a horse cart, and the agricultural production cooperative is like a car. Take our cooperative as an example: this year, the land is used uniformly throughout the cooperative, opening up the old boundaries. The land, which used to be scattered into more than 40 pieces, is connected into eight large pieces according to the terrain, which is one and a half hectares more than in the past. In the past, each family planted their own, but now we can completely plant what is suitable according to the plan and "chaluokou." Like before, Gao Fengming's 1.6 hectares of land was most suitable for planting soybeans, but he had to plant 8 or 9 mu of corn every year for his own consumption. Now all the eight large pieces of land in the cooperative are cultivated according to the nature of the land, with a planned cultivation: a piece of soybeans in the south mountain, a large piece of millet in the southeast, and a piece of corn in the west of the river. A batch of forces has also been freed up to improve the soil. Now we have pulled 600 carts of black soil into 15 hectares of yellow soil to make the land fertile. Also, new agricultural tools can be used, and we don't have to run around with agricultural tools anymore! The organization and division of labor of the labor force is also more reasonable than in the past. Now, the division of labor and industry is carried out meticulously according to each person's specialties. Everyone can use their skills and everyone can exert greater strength.

	In the cooperative, everyone has exerted a high degree of labor enthusiasm and completed the spring plowing fifteen days ahead of schedule. A few days ago, we held another meeting of cooperative members to discuss the summer hoeing work in detail, stipulating that we should do five shovels and five trips, protect seedlings and prevent drought, prevent waterlogging, prevent insect pests, apply topdressing fertilizer, and reclaim wasteland; it was also decided to start implementing the contract system of specialized work for special personnel, fixed quality, and fixed quantity. Every member is working happily and singing happily: "...Just because the mutual aid group is doing well, the roots of the cooperative are deeply rooted, and the path of light is taken step by step, and the scenery of the whole village is renewed day by day. Zero pieces of land are connected into pieces, scattered mules and horses are combined into groups, new agricultural tools are powerful, and patriotic grain production is increased by hundreds of tons,..."

	Respected Chairman Mao: Under the leadership and education of the Party, the members are gradually developing a new consciousness of collectivism in collective labor. Everyone has combined personal interests, cooperative interests, and national interests. Most people realize that the selfish and self-interested thinking of taking care of oneself is a stumbling block to running the cooperative well and moving towards agricultural collectivization. Member Zhang Suzhen, who is already the mother of six children, gets up every day in the middle of the night during the busy farming season to cook for everyone, and also takes care of breastfeeding children for others during the day. Someone advised her to rest, and she said: "For the cooperative, for everyone, for moving towards collective farms, it doesn't matter if I'm a little tired!" Yu He said, "In the past, I didn't care when I saw cattle trampling on other people's land; the day before yesterday, I felt heartache when I saw cattle trampling on the land. Because I also have a share in it! I caught it." Everyone not only cares about their own agricultural production cooperative but also pays attention to helping the masses in neighboring villages solve their difficulties. During the spring sowing, some members suggested: We can't just run our cooperative well, we also have to help neighboring villages so that they can quickly get on our road. This suggestion was agreed by the whole cooperative. When the spring plowing was busy, our cooperative took the initiative to send three sets of plows to help Dadian Village cultivate the land, so that they did not delay the season and finished planting the land. We also took 10 million yuan from our cooperative's public funds and put it in the credit department of the village supply and marketing cooperative to help poor farmers in each village solve their difficulties in production. We heard that some mutual aid groups in Xinli Village lacked seeds, and Zi'an Village lacked livestock. We took the initiative to lend seeds and livestock to help them solve their difficulties. We think this way: This year, the Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang called on all farmers in the Northeast to produce 20 million tons of grain. This cannot be done by one or two families or one or two villages producing more grain; every family and every village must increase production. We love our beautiful life so much, and we love our great motherland even more, because we clearly know that only in the new China led by Chairman Mao can our farmers have such a good life now and a beautiful and bright future. The patriotic covenant posted on the walls of every household in our village reads: "Be prepared at all times, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, support the front line, provide people when needed, provide vehicles when needed, provide horses when needed, whenever needed, whenever we arrive..." In this way, all the people in our cooperative and the whole village are like combatants at all times, ready to defend their country with practical actions at any time.

	Respected Chairman Mao: We are growing up in the happy new China, and everyone's heart is like a fire. We all chat together: listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao forever. We think this way: If we run the agricultural production cooperative well, aren't we seeing the edge of socialism? Thinking of collective farms, the beautiful vision of socialism, everyone is more motivated. Adults and children in the whole village are singing: "...We have strength, we have confidence, we cooperate and work together, and we work harder and harder. Towards collective farms, towards socialism, we are moving forward in big steps!"

	Respected Chairman Mao: We have so many things we want to report to you. Everyone wants to write their inner thoughts on this, but we also think that you are busy and worried about serving the people of the whole country, so let's write here. Finally, our whole cooperative guarantees to do the following four things well as a gift to commemorate the Party's birthday:

	1. Resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and respond to every call of the Party;
	2. Guarantee to complete and exceed the cooperative's 1952 production increase plan;
	3. Strive to study culture, agricultural technology, and current affairs politics, strengthen the collective concept, improve political awareness, and strive for faster progress;
	4. Continue to help neighboring villages, influence neighboring villages, and drive them to move towards mutual assistance and cooperation and the road to collectivization.

	I wish you good health and pay you the highest respect!
	All members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative

    井冈山区人民保证“发扬革命传统争取更大光荣”
    敬爱的毛主席：伟大的“七一”来到了。我们井冈山区的人民，写信向您报告今年的爱国增产运动的情况，提出今后的保证。
    去年八月间，您派来的访问团给我们带来了很大的鼓舞。我们克服了各种困难，在生产战线上打了个大胜仗，获得了山上六十年来未有的大丰收。人民的生活水平，显著提高，全区七百零四户，差不多每家都做了新衣服。生产运动中涌现了不少模范人物，像大井乡贫农邹贵章、下庄乡贫农罗龙茂等八人，被大家选为县劳动模范；李玉兰、刘秉生等九人，被选为区劳动模范，树立了县、区的生产旗帜，推动了爱国增产运动。现在全区四个乡共组织了一个常年互助组，四十三个季节性互助组，十五个爱国丰产小组；修了二百四十九条水圳，一百三十四座水陂；开了一百九十八亩荒地；积肥七百三十八万二千三百六十斤。
    我们提出以下几点保证，作为庆祝“七一”的献礼：一、作好耘田工作，保证作到三耘三锄草；二、作好防兽、防虫、防旱、防洪工作，保证精耕细作，争取在去年的生产基础上，增加产量百分之二十；三、整顿和巩固现有互助组，保证把百分之三十的劳动力组织起来；四、继续开展爱国增产积肥运动，保证完成每人千斤的积肥任务；五、保证利用农闲多搞副业，解决生产中的困难；六、保证搞好爱国卫生运动，作到户户动员，个个动手，处处清洁，人人健康。我们将永远记着您“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，在党和工人阶级领导下，为建设伟大的祖国和保卫世界持久和平而奋斗到底。祝您身体健康，万寿无疆！

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社报告生产情况
    敬爱的毛主席：光荣的、伟大的中国共产党三十一周年的生日——“七一”纪念节又到了，我们真是高兴万分。社里的儿童们都在高声唱着纪念“七一”和“东方红”的歌子。毛主席：在庆祝党的生日的时候，我们想想过去，比比现在，心里就感到有说不完的苦尽甜来的欢喜。我们在您和党的“组织起来”的号召下，从一九四三年，一直集体互助生产到现在，把我们的村庄由穷沟变成了富沟。如今，我们生产合作社的二十六户人家中，就有二十五户有余粮，家家都开始了幸福的生活。我们深深地体验到：离开您，一天也不能过好活；跟着您，才能走上更幸福的日子。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们决心用完成夏季爱国增产竞赛计划的实际行动，支援工业建设，巩固国防，继续加强抗美援朝的力量，来迎接党的伟大生日。为了保证完成夏季竞赛计划，我们要在“七一”以前普遍锄秋田一次，做好防旱除虫保苗工作，准备好追肥肥料，并要买羊五十只来积肥，修滩地十亩，争取秋季作物丰收。我们全体社员和西沟全村农民，已共同订出了三年建设计划。这个计划是根据人民政府加强老根据地建设指示的精神，结合我们“山多地少”的实际情况，民主制订的。计划里主要提出从提高单位面积产量、修滩地、使旱地变水田、大量发展林业畜牧三方面着手。我们算了一下帐，完成三年生产建设计划以后，到一九五四年，全村每个人就可收入到八石八斗四升细粮，超过一九五一年收入的百分之一百三十四点九。那时候，我们的生活就会有更大的变化。毛主席：我们坚决地向着您指引的农业集体化方向前进，为将来的更幸福、更美满的生活而奋斗！祝您身体永远健康！

    曲耀离互助组保证完成爱国增产计划
    敬爱的毛主席：在您英明的领导下，我们的生活过好了，我们组成了棉业丰产模范互助组。共产党的生日到了，我们以无比兴奋的心情，向您报告我们互助组和全村的几件事情。
    先说我们互助组的情况：自从我们响应了您“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，联合向全国棉农发起爱国增产挑战竞赛以后，全组的情绪都很高，春季生产竞赛样样超过计划。春季生产结束以后，我组又订出了夏季棉田管理计划。我组棉田在六月五日就开始浇过头水，十二日浇了第二水。在浇第二水前，我们在棉田里普遍上了一次追肥。十九日浇第三水。接着，我们在棉田里进行了第一次“脱裤”（去掉棉苗下部的一部分叶子），前几天我们还治了一次棉蚜。今年我组的棉苗都很好，枝青叶绿，长得壮实，如今已有八、九寸高了。
    其次再说我村的情况：我们曲庄头村今年和过去可大不一样了。我村去年只有两个互助组，现已发展到四十四个组了。组织起来的劳力和户数都占全村百分之八十以上。今年春天曲耀离向全村各互助组和棉农传授过三次技术；大家都信服了棉苗的多肥密植法和先进的科学技术。全村两千三百五十一亩棉田，在下种前百分之九十五以上都犁了一遍，百分之七十的户都实行了温汤浸种和药剂拌种。冯庄头自然村过去根本没有浸拌种的习惯，听曲耀离讲解了浸拌种的好处后，今年也开始照办了。多肥密植经验也在我村推广开了。我们村六百七十六亩五分水地棉花，今年平均每亩都留到三千株苗。我村在防旱抗旱运动中也做出了成绩。原来我们计划打井六十五眼，现已打成六十七眼，超过计划两眼，还计划再打四眼。今春我们还新添了四十多部水车。这就给今年增产打下了基础。
    敬爱的毛主席：大河没水小渠干，没有国就没有家。我组和我们村的棉农都懂得这个真理。因此，政府的每一个号召，我们都热烈地响应。今春政府号召预售棉花，我组首先带头响应，并推动全村，不到三天就预售了四万四千多斤，超额完成任务。如今，爱国增产竞赛已在我村全面展开了。全村有二十八个互助组都参加了竞赛。参加竞赛的户数已达全村总户数百分之六十一强。我村的官敬义组、刘萍芝组也都选出一亩丰产地，都要产到一千斤籽棉。大伙的竞赛劲头都很高。现下全村的增产竞赛还在继续开展。敬爱的毛主席：请您放心，我们互助组和我们全村今年的爱国增产计划，一定能胜利完成！祝您永远健康！山西解县曲庄头村曲耀离互助组

    报告开展节约运动和反细菌战斗争的情况
    敬爱的毛主席：为了响应您“增加生产，厉行节约”的伟大号召，我们连里展开了节约运动，订出了一九五二年的节约计划。我们青年团员的口号是：“不浪费一颗子弹、一粒粮食，以模范带头的作用，实现毛主席的伟大号召。”我们全连已经给国家节约了共值四千八百七十三万五千五百元的财富。为了不使每一粒来自祖国的粮食糟蹋了，我们每次领粮的时候，都把破了的粮袋缝好；路上看见撒掉的粮食，我们就耐心地一粒一粒地拾起来。
    今年三月五日下午八点钟，美国的空中强盗在我们驻地撒布了很多带菌的跳蚤、蚊子、飞蚂蚁和我们从来没有见过的虫子，平均每平方公尺就有三四十个。经过医生化验后，我们知道这是美国侵略者撒布的细菌毒虫。我们都非常愤怒，当时就展开了反细菌斗争。我们组织了四个小组，及时地把敌人撒布下的细菌毒虫全部烧死扑灭了，我们并做了四百多个打鼠工具、二百个打苍蝇的拍子。我们每人都有几种扑灭毒虫的工具。
    我们对美帝国主义者企图以细菌战毁灭人类的罪行，感到无限愤怒。我们知道：既然敌人的飞机大炮失败了，那么，敌人撒布毒虫的阴谋也会同样失败的！当我们从报纸上看到祖国人民和全世界人民反对美国侵略者的细菌战，积极支援我们粉碎敌人细菌战时，我们都兴奋得跳起来。我们一定要把防疫工作做好，争取防疫战线上的彻底胜利！
    现在，我们正在敌前展开军事练兵，以便进一步提高战术技术，随时准备消灭敢于进犯的敌人。每个同志都知道：“只有提高本领，才能争得更大的胜利！”
    敬爱的毛主席：我们保证继续努力，发扬英雄连长杨根思同志英勇顽强的战斗作风，在党的领导下，团结带领群众，完成上级交给的一切任务。祝您身体健康！

    “步步走的光明道，全屯光景日日新！”
    ——韩恩农业生产合作社向毛主席报告生产成绩
    敬爱的毛主席：中国共产党的生日——“七一”三十一周年来到了。我们全生产合作社的社员，以兴奋愉快的心情，给你写这封信，报告我们成立农业生产合作社前后的一些情形。
    毛主席：自从你领导我们翻了身，我们才当了这一大片黑土地上的主人。从一九四七年起，我们便按照你给我们指出的“组织起来”的道路，实行互助合作，展开大生产运动。五年以来，我们实行集体劳动，很快地发展了生产，全屯土地由二十四垧扩大到四十多垧。一九五一年每亩地的产量是三百十五斤，比解放前增加百分之一百零三点三。我们添置了二十四匹膘肥大马和七辆崭新的胶皮轱轮车，积攒了一亿多元公共财产。年青的妇女都穿上了各色各样的花衣服，家家都过着富裕的生活。村里的六个独身汉，在旧社会里娶不上媳妇，现在都自由自主地结了婚，一对一对愉快地劳动着。大伙学习的劲头也挺高，青年、壮年、老年都在农校里学习文化；全屯出现了一片新气象。
    因为我们这屯互助合作基础较好，大家有集体劳动的习惯，并且有保安村党支部的坚强领导，所以我们今年二月，成立了农业生产合作社。农业生产合作社成立的过程，也就是我们提高觉悟的过程。在这一过程中，大家展开了新旧思想的斗争。就拿土地入股来说，绝大多数组员都主张每人留半亩菜地，下剩的土地都入股，统一耕种，统一分粮。可是，老张头就不同意，因为他每年攒粪多，土地肥，打粮也比别人多。他主张今年送粪时，还是各人往各人地里送，防备万一合作社垮了台，他好把地抽回去。这个意见，受到了大伙的批评。连他儿子张基臣也质问他：“有共产党领导的事情，还会垮台？”别的社员也说：“要成立合作社，大家都要一个心眼，不能三心二意的。”这样，老张头被说服了，把全部土地入了合作社。评论车马入股时，评到常守贵的车马价时，也引起一场思想斗争。常守贵是个富裕中农。他不大愿意把车马入股。他想：自己有整套车马，两个劳动力，不靠土地，光靠拉脚也能过好日子。因此，他只打算入土地股，但又不好意思公开说。在评他的车马价时，他就坚持自己的意见，说自己的胶皮车是八成新，值一千三百万元，还表示：“少一个也不入。”牛德芳、高成和看透了他的心思，就严格地批判他的自私自利思想。这一夜，常守贵没有合眼。他问他的妻子张素云，应该怎么办，张素云坚决主张车马入股。第二天，在张素云主持下召开了家庭会议，全家人都批评了他。他父亲说：“没有互助组借给五百五十万公款，咱们能拴起胶皮车吗？”张素云也说：“咱们靠互助组有了车马；互助组又要前进，也是为咱生产得更好，咱们怎能走回头路？你那样做，怎能对得起共产党和毛主席？”常守贵思前想后，醒过腔来了，觉得自己的做法不对，便向大家承认了自己的错误。我们的生产合作社，就是这样克服了各种自私自利的思想，顺利地成立了。
    毛主席：乍成立农业生产合作社时，有些社员对今年每垧平均比去年增产一千二百八十斤粮食的计划，信心还不足哩。可是从春耕到现在看来，大家都转变了这种想法。迟殿文说：“比去年多增产两千斤也有把握！”因为今年土地普遍做到深耕七寸，比去年深一寸；全部土地上了满粪，每垧地比去年多上十五车，比原订计划增加了五车。“不经一事，不长一智”，我们自从成立了农业生产合作社，就从各方面看出来，它比互助组有更多的优越性。大家都了解：单干赶不上互助组，互助组赶不上农业生产合作社。单干户好比牛车，互助组是马车，农业生产合作社就像是汽车。就拿我们社来说吧：今年全社土地统一使用，打开了旧地界，过去分散成四十多片的土地，按地势连成了八大片，比过去多出来一垧半地。过去各家种各家的，现在完全可以按照计划和“槎口”，种啥合适就种啥。像从前，郜凤鸣的一垧六亩地，最适合种大豆，可是他为了自己吃用，不得不年年种八、九亩苞米。现在全社八大片土地都是按土地的性质，有计划地耕种：南山一片大豆，东南一大片谷子，河西一片苞米。还腾出一批力量来改良土壤。现在我们已经在十五垧黄土地上，拉进去六百车黑壤土，使土地肥沃起来。还有，新农具也得施展作用了，再不用拉着农具到处跑啦！劳动力的组织分工，也比过去更合理了，现在是根据每个人的特长，细密地进行分工分业。人人能施展本领，人人都能发挥更大的力量。
    在社里，每个人都发挥了高度的劳动积极性，提前十五天完成了春耕。前些日子，我们又召开了一个社员大会，详细地讨论了夏锄工作，规定：要做到五铲五趟，保苗防旱，防涝，防虫害，施追肥，开荒；还决定开始实行专人专活、定质定量的包工制。每个社员都在愉快地劳动着，愉快地歌唱着：“……只因为互助组办得好，合作社的根才扎的深，步步走的是光明道，全屯的光景日日新。零块的土地连成了片，分散的骡马合成了群，新式农具力量大，爱国粮增产几百吨，……”
    敬爱的毛主席：社员们在党的领导教育下，在集体劳动中，逐渐生长着集体主义的新意识。大家把个人利益、合作社利益和国家利益结合起来了。大部分人认识到：各顾各的自私自利思想，是搞好合作社，走向农业集体化的绊脚石。社员张素贞，已经是六个孩子的母亲，农忙时，天天半夜起床给大伙做饭，白天还给别人代管吃奶的小孩。有人劝她休息，她说：“为了合作社，为了大家，为了向集体农庄走，累一点不算啥！”于和说：“早先看见牛糟蹋别人的地，我很不在意；前天我看见牛糟蹋地，就心痛。因为这也有我一份呀！我把它捉住了。”大家不但关心自己的农业生产合作社，而且注意帮助邻屯群众解决困难。在春起开种那?，有的社员建议：我们不能光把咱合作社搞好就算完哪，还要帮助邻屯，也让他们很快地走上咱们这条道上来。这个建议，得到全社的同意。在春耕忙的时候，我社主动出三付犁杖，帮助大甸村耕种，使他们没有耽误节气，种完了地。我们又从我社公共资金中拿出一千万元，放到村供销社信贷部里，帮助各屯贫困农民解决生产上的困难。我们听说新立屯有的互助组里缺种籽，自安屯缺牲口，我们主动地借给种籽、借给牲口，帮助他们解决了困难。我们这样想：今年东北人民政府高岗主席号召全东北农民要生产两千万吨粮食，这可不是一家两家、一屯两屯多打粮就能办到的，必须家家屯屯都增产才行呢。我们热爱自己这样美好的生活，我们也就更加热爱伟大的祖国，因为我们清楚地知道：只有在毛主席领导的新中国里，咱们农民才能有现在这样的好生活和将来美丽灿烂的前途。我屯家家户户墙上贴的爱国公约里头，都写着这么一条：“时时刻刻准备妥当，抗美援朝，支援前线，要人有人，要车有车，要马有马，什么时候要，什么时候到。……”就这样，我们全社全屯的人，什么时候也都像战斗员一样，随时都准备用实际行动来保卫自己的祖国。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们生长在幸福的新中国里，人人心里都像一团火似的，我们大伙到一块就唠扯：听毛主席的话，要永远跟着毛主席走。我们这样想：搞好了农业生产合作社，这不眼看着就摸到社会主义的边了吗？想到集体农庄，社会主义美丽的远景，大伙更有奔头了。全屯大人小孩都在唱着：“……我们有力量，我们有信心，分工合作，齐心努力，越干越有劲。朝着集体农庄，走向社会主义，大踏步向前进！”
    敬爱的毛主席：我们想报告给您的事情太多了，每个人都想把自己的心里话，写在这上面，可是又想您为全国人民办事操心，太忙啦，就写到这里吧。最后，我们全社保证做好下面四件事，作为纪念党的生日的献礼：
    一、坚决听毛主席的话，响应党的每一个号召；
    二、保证完成并超过全社一九五二年的增产计划；
    三、努力学习文化、农业技术和时事政治，加强集体观念，提高政治觉悟，争取更快地进步；
    四、继续帮助邻屯、影响邻屯，带动他们朝着互助合作、集体化的道路前进。
    祝您身体健康，并致以崇高的敬礼！
