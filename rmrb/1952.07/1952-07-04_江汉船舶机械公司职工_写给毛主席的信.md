Letter to Chairman Mao from Employees of Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company

Dear Chairman Mao:

We are workers of the Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company in Wuhan. Under your leadership, we have continuously improved our class consciousness and created a large amount of wealth for the motherland. In 1951, we manufactured China's first cutter suction dredger. This year, we participated in the motherland's great water conservancy project – the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project – and completed our task ahead of schedule.

When the news came that the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project's forty intake gate doors were assigned to us for manufacture, how excited we were! Master workers and young workers alike pledged to complete the task assigned to us by the motherland and the people according to plan. Since the work began, everyone has been working hard with selfless labor enthusiasm, working in the sun and rain, and creating many new records. In order to punch holes in the channel steel on the gate doors, the shear punch workers, Luo Zhongjun and others, collectively researched a complete set of tools for punching channel steel, saving the labor of twenty-five electric drills and ensuring compliance with standards. When casting the worm gear for the winch, technicians and workers researched and improved the operation method, so that the cast worm gear met the specifications without processing, saving one thousand one hundred man-hours. We carefully researched every job before we started. We also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to achieve the three major requirements of good, fast, and economical. We know that saving more wealth for the country is to increase the strength of building the motherland; ensuring that the quality is strong and reliable is to be responsible to the people.

Dear Chairman Mao, in early May, your representative brought the banner with your inscription to our factory to express your regards, which further strengthened our confidence in victory. Because of this, manual riveting created a national record of riveting eight hundred pounds in eight hours. With the hard work of the comrades, the task was finally completed fourteen days ahead of schedule on June 16.

In order to commemorate our Party's birthday and express our respect for you, we guarantee that on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, we will strive to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and together with the working brothers and sisters across the country, build the motherland even better.

We wish you good health!

              All Employees of Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company

### 江汉船舶机械公司职工  写给毛主席的信

    写给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是武汉市江汉船舶机械公司的工人，在您的领导下，我们不断提高了阶级觉悟，为祖国创造了大量财富。一九五一年，我们制造了我国第一艘绞刀式挖泥船。今年，我们又参加了祖国伟大的水利建设——荆江分洪工程，并且提前完成了任务。
    当荆江分洪工程的四十部进洪闸门交给我们制造的消息传出以后，我们是多么兴奋啊！老师傅和青工都纷纷保证，一定要按照计划完成祖国及人民交给我们的任务。工作展开以来，大家都以忘我的劳动热忱努力工作，那怕日晒雨淋，工作都是照样进行，并且创造了很多新纪录。为了使闸门上的槽铁能够铳出眼子来，剪铳工人罗仲俊等集体研究了一套完整的铳槽铁的工具，节省了二十五把电钻的人工，并保证合乎标准。在铸造绞车蜗轮时，技术人员与工人互相研究改进了操作法，使铸造出来的蜗轮不需加工就合规格，节省了一千一百个人工。我们做每一件活都是经过了细心研究才动手的。我们还学习了苏联的先进经验，做到好、快、省三大要求。我们知道多为国家节省一些财富，就是增强一分建设祖国的力量；把质量做到坚牢可靠，就是对人民负责。
    亲爱的毛主席，五月上旬您的代表携带着您亲笔题字的锦旗到我们工厂来慰问，更增强了我们胜利的信心。因为这样，人力铆钉创造了八小时铆八百斤的全国最高纪录。在同志们努力工作之下，终于在六月十六日提前十四天完成了任务。
    为了纪念我们党的生日，表示对您的敬爱，我们保证在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，努力开展增产节约运动，和全国工人弟兄一道把祖国建设得更美好。敬祝您的身体健康！
              江汉船舶机械公司全体职工
