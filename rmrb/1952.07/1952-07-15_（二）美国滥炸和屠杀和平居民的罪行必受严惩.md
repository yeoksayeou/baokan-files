    (II) The U.S. Crime of Indiscriminate Bombing and Slaughter of Peaceful Residents Will Be Severely Punished
    Following the bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant, the U.S. Air Force in Korea carried out a barbaric concentrated bombing and strafing of Pyongyang, a peaceful city in Korea, on the 11th. In this frenzied action, the U.S. aggressors also wantonly bombed our prisoner-of-war camps near Pyongyang, causing a serious bloodbath with 110 deaths and injuries among the captured personnel on the other side. Obviously, this is another serious provocative act by the United States in disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations and further expanding the war of aggression, and another major criminal act by the U.S. aggressors in violating humanitarianism and destroying international law.
    The U.S. Air Force's bombing of Pyongyang is entirely a war crime of slaughtering peaceful residents and destroying a peaceful city. Anyone who has been to Korea knows that Pyongyang is a city that has been severely damaged by the U.S. aggressors and has no military targets. Pyongyang residents have rebuilt and established a peaceful life under extremely difficult conditions. The Korean people's strong will to live and their hard-working and courageous spirit are admired by all honest and peace-loving people. However, the inhuman U.S. aggressors showed a crazy jealousy of the Korean people's strong will to rebuild a peaceful life. They actually took the gradually recovering peaceful life of Pyongyang as a "mature" target and carried out the "most violent" bombing since the Korean War, dropping 500,000 kilograms of high-explosive bombs and tens of thousands of liters of napalm on residential areas, markets, hospitals, and prisoner-of-war camps in Pyongyang and its suburbs, and firing many rockets and machine guns and cannons. U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland even quibbled on the 12th, saying: "The bombing targets were carefully selected after studying reconnaissance aircraft's monthly reports of photography and intelligence agencies, all to avoid bombing residential civilians and areas with prisoner-of-war camps." However, not only are the residential areas, markets, and hospitals of Pyongyang "reduced to burning ruins" undeniable evidence of the U.S. aggressors' frenzied crimes, but also the captured personnel on the other side who were injured by the bombing are eyewitnesses to this fact. Weyland's sophistry only proves that the U.S. aggressors' destruction of peaceful cities, slaughter of peaceful residents, and bombing of prisoner-of-war camps with obvious targets were premeditated crimes. This is something that no lies or sophistry can deny.
    From this, people can see more clearly the difference between the beautiful words and actual actions of the U.S. aggressors. The words of the U.S. negotiating representatives at the armistice talks expressing their willingness to "seek an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea" are still in our ears, but the U.S. Air Force in Korea has successively disrupted the Korean armistice talks with aerial provocations and large-scale massacres of civilians; U.S. generals and officials have also repeatedly preached lies about "humanitarianism" and respecting the "basic human rights" of prisoners of war, but even after they expressed their willingness to negotiate, they not only continued to massacre and persecute our captured personnel, but also intensified the bombing of our prisoner-of-war camps, massacring a large number of captured personnel on the other side who were eager to return to their homes. This cannot but expose the two-faced tactics played by the U.S. aggressors in the recent negotiations in Korea. The peace-loving Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world must be doubly vigilant against the tricks of the U.S. aggressors.
    Since the U.S. Air Force in Korea bombed the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant on the 23rd of last month, U.S. generals have unreservedly stated that this is their means of trying to force us to submit. This is, of course, an extremely stupid and ignorant delusion. The facts on the Korean battlefield over the past two years have long proven that every desperate struggle of the enemy can only bring about greater failures and put them in a more isolated position worldwide. The angry protests and accusations of honest people all over the world and the fierce quarrels within the aggressive bloc caused by the U.S.'s crazy bombing of the Yalu River Power Plant are the most vivid illustrations. Therefore, the enemy will not get any other results from the bombing of Pyongyang.
    We, the Chinese people, express our great anger at the U.S. aggressors' bloodthirsty and bloody atrocities; we express our brotherly sympathy to the afflicted Korean people. We must make greater efforts to support the Korean front and the Korean people in order to combat the aggressors. At the same time, we are fully convinced that the heroic Korean people will be able to overcome the grief and life difficulties caused by the enemy's indiscriminate bombing and continue to bravely advance and strive for the final victory in the war against U.S. aggression. The U.S. aggressors will absolutely not escape the responsibility for their brutal crimes of destroying peaceful cities and indiscriminately massacring peaceful residents by any means; the peace-loving people of the world must severely punish the enemies of peace.

### （二）美国滥炸和屠杀和平居民的罪行必受严惩

    （二）美国滥炸和屠杀和平居民的罪行必受严惩
    侵朝美国空军继轰炸鸭绿江发电厂之后，又于十一日对朝鲜的和平城市平壤进行了野蛮的集中轰炸和扫射。在这次疯狂行动中，美国侵略者并对平壤近郊的我方战俘营肆行轰炸，造成了对方被俘人员死伤一百十名的严重血案。显然，这是美国最近破坏朝鲜停战谈判、进一步扩大侵略战争的又一次严重的挑衅行为，这是美国侵略者违反人道和破坏国际法的又一次重大的犯罪行为。
    美国侵朝空军对平壤的轰炸，完全是屠杀和平居民、毁灭和平城市的战争罪行。任何到过朝鲜的人都知道，平壤是经过美国侵略者惨重破坏的、毫无军事目标的城市。平壤居民在极端困难的条件下重新经营并建立起和平的生活。朝鲜人民的这种坚强的生活意志和勤劳勇敢的精神，是所有正直、和平的人类一致敬佩的。然而毫无人性的美国侵略者却对朝鲜人民重建和平生活的坚强意志，表现了疯狂的嫉恨。他们竟然把逐渐恢复起来的平壤和平生活作为“成熟”的目标，施行了朝鲜战争以来“最为猛烈”的轰炸，对平壤及近郊的居民住宅、市场、医院、战俘营投掷了五十万公斤高度爆炸弹、数万公升黏性汽油，发射了许多火箭和机关枪大炮的炮火。美国远东空军总司令威兰还居然在十二日诡辩说：“轰炸目标都是在研究了侦察机一个月的摄影及情报机关的报告后，仔细挑选出来的，这都是为避免轰炸居住平民和设有战俘营的地带。”但是，不仅“成为烈火熊熊的废墟”的平壤居民住宅、市场、医院是美国侵略者疯狂罪行的无可抵赖的罪证，而且因遭受轰炸而受伤的对方被俘人员都是这一事实的当场见证人。威兰的诡辩恰好证明了美国侵略者破坏和平城市、屠杀和平居民及设有明显目标的战俘营中的战俘，是久已蓄谋的犯罪。这是任何谎言和诡辩都抵赖不了的。
    由此人们可以更加清楚地看出美国侵略者的漂亮言词与实际行动之间的差别。美国谈判代表在停战谈判会议上表示愿意“觅求停战，以终止朝鲜的流血”的话还在耳际，而美国侵朝空军就接二连三地以空中挑衅和大规模屠杀平民的流血暴行，来破坏朝鲜停战谈判；美国的将军和官员们也曾一再侈谈“人道主义”和尊重战俘“基本人权”之类的谎话，然而即使在他们表示了愿意协商的态度之后，他们不但依然继续屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员，并且还变本加厉地继续轰炸我方战俘营，大量屠杀渴望重返家园的对方的被俘人员。这就不能不暴露出美国侵略者最近在朝鲜谈判中所玩弄着的两面手法。爱好和平的中朝人民和世界人民对于美国侵略者的诡计一定要加倍地提高警惕。
    自上月二十三日美国侵朝空军轰炸了鸭绿江水力发电厂之后，美国的将军们就毫不讳言地表示这是他们企图迫使我方屈服的手段。这当然是极端愚蠢无知的妄想。两年来朝鲜战场上的事实早已证明了，敌人每一次绝望的挣扎都只能招来更大的失败，并使它们在全世界范围内陷入更加孤立的地位。美国对鸭绿江发电厂的疯狂轰炸所引起的全世界正直人士的愤怒抗议和指责以及侵略集团内部的激烈争吵就是最生动的说明。因而，从对平壤的轰炸暴行中敌人也不会得到任何其他的结果。
    我们中国人民对美国侵略者的这种嗜杀的血腥暴行表示极大的愤怒；对被难的朝鲜人民表示兄弟手足般的同情。我们一定要以更大的努力来支援朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民以打击侵略者。同时我们也完全相信，英勇的朝鲜人民一定能够克服由于敌人的狂轰滥炸所造成的悲痛和生活上的困难，继续奋勇前进，争取抗美战争的最后胜利。美国侵略者绝对逃不脱他们毁灭和平城市、不择手段地大规模屠杀和平居民的残暴罪行的责任；全世界爱好和平的人民一定要给和平的敌人以严厉的惩罚。
