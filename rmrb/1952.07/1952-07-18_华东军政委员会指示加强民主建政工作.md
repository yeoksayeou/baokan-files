    East China Military and Administrative Committee Issues Instructions to Strengthen Democratic Political Construction Work
    The East China Military and Administrative Committee recently issued instructions on strengthening the construction of people's democratic political power.
    Over the past three years, provinces, cities, and counties in the East China region have generally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, established consultative committees of people's representative conferences from all walks of life, and some people's representative conferences from all walks of life have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses on their behalf. The political construction work in the past three years has promoted the progress of central tasks in various periods, solved the most urgent demands of the masses in various periods, and strengthened the ties between the government and the people. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work: the development of the work is very uneven, the people's representative conference has not yet formed a regular system; it has been possible to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses on behalf of it without doing so; township construction has not attracted enough attention, and there is still a tendency to build townships in isolation from the central tasks; many cadres still hold a simple utilitarian and task-oriented view of the people's representative conferences. All these have hindered the further improvement of democratic political power construction work. In response to this situation, the East China Military and Administrative Committee issued instructions on strengthening democratic political power construction work. The instructions stipulate: (1) People's representative conferences of provinces (regions), counties, and cities should generally exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses on their behalf and become a regular system. Provinces (regions) and cities, except in special circumstances, should strive to fully exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses on their behalf within this year, and strive to ensure that people's representative conferences in all counties in the East China region exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses on their behalf before the spring plowing next year. (2) On the premise of strengthening county political construction, township political construction should be gradually carried out to strengthen the grassroots organizational work of people's democratic political power. Township peasant representative conferences should generally transition to township people's representative conferences by expanding the number of representatives, elect township chiefs, deputy township chiefs, and committee members to form township people's government committees. In the future, township elections should preferably be held every year before county elections. Township people's governments should, according to the local people's living conditions, divide electoral districts, abolish village-level organizations, establish a representative system, and township people's government committees should establish various working committees, widely absorbing activists in the township to participate in the work, and do as much as possible to ensure that one person has one job, so that cadres' production and work are not delayed. Special attention should be paid to improving the township's financial system, strictly implementing the budget, publicizing accounts, saving expenses, and strictly prohibiting any fundraising without approval. Counties and districts must strengthen their leadership over townships, and each district must do a good job of a model township according to the above requirements.
    (3) The focus of political construction in large and medium-sized cities is district construction. Where district people's governments have not been established, they should be generally established within this year, district people's representative conferences should be convened, and efforts should be made to have all or most of them exercise the functions and powers of district people's congresses on their behalf. Cities should strengthen their leadership over districts, clarify the division of labor between cities and districts, improve the organizational structure of districts, strengthen the unified leadership of districts. The residents' organizations below the district level should be improved on the basis of the original ones after typical experiments, according to the draft of the "East China Military and Administrative Committee's Trial Program for Establishing Residents' Committees in Cities with a Population of More Than 100,000".
    (4) In townships, towns, districts, and counties where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, autonomous townships, autonomous towns, autonomous districts, or autonomous counties should be established in accordance with regulations. In areas where a considerable number of ethnic minorities live scattered, the local people's government should take appropriate measures to ensure that they have representatives to participate in the organs of political power. People's governments at all levels should help all ethnic minorities develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings, train ethnic cadres, and consolidate ethnic unity.

    华东军政委员会指示加强民主建政工作
    华东军政委员会最近发布了关于加强人民民主政权建设工作的指示。
    三年来，华东区的省、市、县都普遍召开了各界人民代表会议，建立了各界人民代表会议协商委员会，并有部分的各界人民代表会议代行了人民代表大会的职权。三年来的建政工作，推动了各个时期的中心任务的进行，解决了各个时期群众最迫切的要求，密切了政府与人民群众之间的联系。但工作中还存在着若干缺点：工作的发展很不平衡，人民代表会议还没有形成经常制度；已经具备条件能够代行人民代表大会职权的而没有代行；乡政建设还没有引起足够的重视，还存在着脱离中心任务孤立建乡的偏向；还有不少干部对人民代表会议抱着单纯的使用观点和任务观点。这些都阻碍了民主政权建设工作的进一步提高。针对这种情况，华东军政委员会发出了关于加强民主政权建设工作的指示。指示中规定：（一）省（区）、县、市人民代表会议应普遍代行人民代表大会职权，并成为经常的制度。省（区）、市除特殊情形外，应争取在今年年内全部代行人民代表大会职权，争取在明年春耕前做到华东全区各县人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权。（二）在加强县政建设的前提之下，应逐步建设乡政，加强人民民主政权的基层组织工作。乡农民代表会议应经过扩大代表名额的方法，普遍过渡为乡人民代表会议，选举乡长、副乡长、委员，组成乡人民政府委员会。今后乡选以在每年县选之前举行为宜。乡人民政府应根据当地人民居住情况，划分选区，废除村一级组织，建立代表制，乡人民政府委员会应成立各种工作委员会，广泛吸收本乡积极分子参加工作，尽可能做到一人一职，使干部生产与工作两不耽误。应特别注意健全乡的财政制度，严格执行预算，公布账目，节省开支，严禁未经批准的任何筹募。县、区对乡的领导必须加强，每个区要根据上述要求做好一个模范乡的工作。（三）大中城市的建政工作以建区为重点。凡未建立区人民政府的，应于今年年内普遍建立，召开区人民代表会议，并争取全部或大部代行区人民代表大会职权。市要加强对区的领导，明确市和区的分工，健全区的组织机构，加强区的统一领导。区以下的居民组织，根据“华东军政委员会关于十万人口以上城市建立居民委员会试行方案”的草案，经过典型试验，在原有的基础上加以改进。
    （四）在少数民族聚居的乡、镇或区、县，应根据规定，建立少数民族自治乡、自治镇、自治区或自治县。凡有相当数量少数民族散居的地区，当地人民政府应采取适当办法，使其有代表参加政权机关。各级人民政府应帮助各少数民族发展其政治、经济和文化教育的建设事业，培养民族干部，巩固民族团结。    （新华社）
