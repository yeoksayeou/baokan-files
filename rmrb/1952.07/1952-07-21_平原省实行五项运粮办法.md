    Implementing Five Grain Transportation Methods in Pingyuan Province

    Comrade Editor: Currently, the summer grain levy is being stored in large quantities, but during this period of intense heat and the rainy season, a few areas have experienced incidents of human and animal casualties due to inadequate planning. In order to strengthen the planning of transportation work and effectively prevent the occurrence of human and animal casualties, Pingyuan Province has proposed five measures for transportation work during the summer levy, and the results are good. These five measures are:

    I. Cadres at the county, district, and village levels should clearly delineate responsibility areas and implement a dedicated responsibility system, taking the lead in personally going deep into each village to carefully inspect the conditions of people and animals, as well as the preparation work for transportation organization and road and bridge surveys.

    II. The village-level transportation team should have the village head or militia captain as the team leader, responsible for registering all the manpower and animal power in the village, and strictly reviewing the formation of teams; hire personnel in the village who understand livestock teeth to check the age of livestock, and strictly prohibit unqualified people and animals from participating in hired transportation. Assign experienced drivers to each vehicle. Every few vehicles should be formed into a group, and a dedicated person should be appointed to be responsible for each group, with the team leader responsible for leading the team. If an accident occurs, responsibility will be investigated at each level.

    III. Grain stations and village transportation teams should maintain close contact and sign handover contracts, which strictly stipulate the grain delivery plan with fixed time and quantity, to ensure that the grain quality is clean, full, and meets the specified standards; strictly prohibit unqualified people and animals from participating in hired transportation. This can avoid vehicle congestion and chaotic grain collection.

    IV. The handover contracts signed by the village transportation teams and the grain stations should be reported to the district for review in order to control the transportation situation in the entire district and prevent chaos. If there are difficulties in implementing the contract, contact the grain station to revise the contract.

    V. In addition to doing a good job in preparing for grain collection and providing tea, water, and medical care, grain station personnel should also actively contact various villages to grasp the overall handover plan, assist in the inspection of storage and transportation work, and promptly criticize or commend the transportation teams of various villages. If there is a chaotic organizational phenomenon, they should be ordered to stop transportation immediately, and after rectification, transportation should be resumed.    Xia Yu

    平原省实行五项运粮办法
    编辑同志：目前夏征公粮正大量入库，但时值酷暑雨季，少数地区因计划不周，发生人畜伤亡事件。平原省为加强运输工作的计划性及有效地制止人畜伤亡的发生，在夏征中提出了对运输工作的五项措施，效果良好。这五项措施是：
    一、县、区、村各级干部明确划分责任区，实行专责制，逐级带头亲自深入各村，认真检查人、畜条件，及运输组织与道路桥梁勘验等准备工作。
    二、村级运输队以村长或自卫队长为队长，负责登记全村人、畜力，严格审查编组；聘请村中懂牲畜口齿的人员检验畜龄，严禁不合格的人、畜参加雇运。每车指定熟手驾驶。每数车编为一组，每组指出专人负责，队长负责带队，发生事故逐级追查责任。
    三、粮站和村运输队保持密切联系，订立交接合同，其中严密规定定时定量的交粮计划，保证粮质干净饱满，合于规定标准；严禁不合格的人畜参加雇运。这就可以避免车辆拥挤、收粮混乱现象。
    四、各村运输队与粮站订立的交接合同，应报区审查，以便控制全区运输情况，不使混乱。如有困难不能执行合同时，应与粮站联系，重订合同。
    五、粮站人员除作好收粮准备及茶水、医药招待工作外，并主动与各村联系，掌握全面交接计划，协助屯运检查工作，对各村运输队及时加以批评或表扬。如有组织混乱现象，应即勒令停运，从速整顿后再行开运。    夏余
