Editor's Note: Li Feng'en is the first blast furnace technician cultivated by the Northeast Iron and Steel Plant using the accelerated method. This report vividly illustrates how Li Feng'en overcame difficulties, worked hard, and finally became an excellent technician. After listening to Li Feng'en's report, the workers of the Northeast Iron and Steel Plant improved their confidence and worked hard to learn. This report uses the author's personal experience to criticize the view held by some people that workers cannot become technicians.

New China Gave Me the Opportunity to Study

I was born into a working-class family. In the old society, my father was a worker at the iron and steel plant who carried large baskets. He saved every penny he could and managed to send me to elementary school when I was fourteen. I had only studied for a year and seven months when I was expelled from school because I didn't have the money for a Boy Scout uniform for the school sports meet. From then on, I did odd jobs with my father. At the age of eighteen, I started working as a furnace operator at the iron-smelting furnace.

After the liberation of all of Northeast China, the People's Government took over the iron and steel plant. Production developed day by day, and the workers' awareness increased day by day. Soon, I joined the Communist Party. We ended our life of suffering, and everyone worked with doubled spirits and intensity for production and construction.

One day in December of the year before last, Party Secretary Xin Ruiqing called me in and said to me, "Old Li! Aren't you always worried that you can't even write your own name properly? Now we're asking you to go to a technical workers' school to study, improve your education, and come back to learn technology..." Before he could finish speaking, I laughed out loud with joy.

After studying at the technical school for a week, I hit a major snag—I only got twenty points on the arithmetic test. I felt a bit discouraged. Group leader Li Chengxuan patiently advised me: "Learning is difficult at the beginning, like walking. At the beginning, you don't know how far you're going, and you feel unsure, but as you walk, you see the end, and you have energy." Later, our group made a contract, and everyone helped me study. I would ask about anything I didn't understand. Sometimes, the teacher had to teach me three or four times. In the second week, I got over forty points on the test. In the third week, I got sixty points, and I did better and better on the tests afterwards, finally getting a hundred points.

After finishing my studies at the technical school, the eleven of us who returned to the factory were assigned jobs one by one. I was assigned last. The personnel section chief said, "Li Feng'en, you'll go to Blast Furnace No. 2 to learn technology from technician Zhou Chuandian. If you learn well, you'll become a technician. Our workers must combine labor and technology. We not only have to be masters outside the furnace, but also masters inside the furnace. You're the first one. I hope you'll set an example for everyone." When I heard this, I felt very surprised and thought, "What's going on? I only have a year and seven months of education, and I've only been studying for six months. How can I learn to be a technician? Students who graduated from 'Guo Gao' (junior high school) under the puppet Manchukuo had to work as signalmen for seven or eight years before becoming group leaders, and after becoming group leaders, they had to work for another ten years before becoming technicians. In the Kuomintang, technicians were all college graduates who came by plane. Even now, technicians are all college students. How can I learn that!" But when I saw that everyone had no objections, I swallowed my own opinion and didn't say anything, but I didn't feel good inside. I felt very anxious. I also thought that as a Communist Party member, I must not drop my work and raise objections. I have to do it first, and then raise objections later. So I went to Blast Furnace No. 2.

"A Communist Party Member Should Not Bow to Difficulties!"

Before entering the technical school, I was a signalman at Blast Furnace No. 1. I was also familiar with the workers at Blast Furnace No. 2, but I didn't know all four of the shift technicians. I took my letter of introduction and went up the stairs of Blast Furnace No. 2. I was just about to enter the signal room when I saw someone coming towards me, wearing glasses, with a face covered in ash and hands black with soot. It looked like he had just finished tapping iron. I asked him, "Where is Technician Zhou?" He glanced at me and said, "What's the matter? I am him." I handed him the letter of introduction. After reading the letter, he immediately took my hand and led me into the room, as if he had known me for a long time.

I was afraid that he didn't understand me, so I hurried to introduce myself. Before I could finish speaking, he said, "I know, I know. Director Wen and Party Secretary Wang Feng have both spoken to me about you. Don't be shy. I don't have many days on duty. You have practical experience, so let's help each other." He didn't let go of my hand and spoke to me face to face. He gave me a good impression from the start.

After that, he worked while leading me to look around, and then he discussed with me: "Old Li! To be able to direct the furnace operation as a technician, we must simply understand some of the chemical changes in the furnace and learn some basic and simple theoretical knowledge, right?" "That's right, you should tell me about it." I said this, but I was nervous, wondering if I would understand it.

So, during his off-work hours, he lectured to me for two nights, also in order to understand my level. The more I listened, the more confused I became. If I didn't understand him after he explained it once, I still didn't understand it after he explained it again. I only knew in the past that ore was ore, and I didn't know that it had those components. I didn't know what silicon dioxide was at all. Oxidation processes, reduction processes, and so on made me even more confused. Although I didn't understand, I thought it was very new, so I used the old method from the technical school: ask. When I was working, I followed Old Zhou and asked about everything I saw. I had questions all day long. But no matter how he told me, I still didn't understand many things, which worried me.

During those days when I was worried, once, I came back from a meeting in the director's office and walked to the bottom of Blast Furnace No. 1. I saw a few people standing at the entrance of the dispatch room upstairs. I saw them pointing at me and talking about something. When I went upstairs and walked up to them, they stopped talking. I knew they weren't saying anything good. Afterwards, I found Shi Zhongxian (who was the signalman I personally trained) and asked him. At first, he didn't say anything and asked me, "How is your learning going?" I said, "A little difficult!"

"You have to study hard!" I felt that there was something behind these words. I asked him, but he still didn't say. I pretended to be angry with him, and he finally said:

"I'll tell you, but don't get emotional!"

"No, tell me!" I said.

"They said that the superiors didn't have good eyes this time. After picking and choosing, they picked Li Feng'en to learn to be a technician. He only has a little over a year of education. There are plenty of people with more education than him; there are plenty of people with more seniority than him. He's not any smarter than anyone else! Just you watch, he won't learn anything!" He took a breath and encouraged me, "I told you, but you can't get emotional. You have to study even harder and let them see if workers can really become technicians."

I wasn't willing to give up, so I found an old and prudent worker and asked him, "Old Brother Li! Do you think it's hard for me to learn this stuff!" Seeing that my tone was already mostly discouraged, he smacked his lips for a long time and finally said, "It's difficult, it's relatively difficult! ... But it's also possible! ... Hurry up and learn!" The more he said that, the more I realized that he didn't think I could learn it well from the bottom of his heart! After hearing these words, I was indeed a little discouraged and disappointed.

Back at the factory, Technician Zhou was teaching me to look at the iron samples and told me, "The iron is hot." I said, "Okay!"

He told me that there were too many iron flowers, and how to do this and that. I nodded and didn't say anything. Technician Zhou noticed that I wasn't energetic and asked me, "What's wrong with you today! Do you have something on your mind?" I said, "No." He said, "That's not right. You're not usually like this. You have questions all day long, but you're especially unhappy today. Why?" I saw that I couldn't hide it, so I told him the truth. He said, "What do you think after hearing these words? What are you planning to do?"

"What they said is the truth. They told me to turn back early, that I just can't learn it! I didn't have confidence in the beginning!" He called me to the signal room and said to me, "Old Li: I was just about to talk to you. The branch secretary and I have been studying your learning problem. I wanted to make a self-criticism to you. The method I used to teach you in the past was wrong. At the beginning, I shouldn't have told you so much theory, which made you feel difficult. You've been a signalman and a furnace operator, and you understand a lot of practical situations, which is your advantage in learning. In the past, I didn't teach you well based on these advantages, which is my fault. From today onwards, let's change both the teaching and learning methods, and you'll be able to learn. As long as you can learn, it doesn't matter if you learn slower!" Later, he said a lot of comforting words to me.

Afterwards, the branch secretary also found me and criticized me:

"A Communist Party member should not bow to difficulties! You should turn the strange things the masses say about you into a force to push yourself to progress, learn well and show everyone, and use the facts to break everyone's conservative ideas!"

Sure enough, Technician Zhou changed the teaching method: he first asked me to copy the analysis sheet, without explaining the theory, starting entirely from practice, teaching one thing before teaching another, and not explaining anything without obvious facts. He also used everyday things to make analogies so that I could understand as soon as I heard them. My learning mood gradually stabilized again.

Brotherly Contract and Family Contract

I learned for two months in one breath, and I finished the first stage. The third month was learning to master various instruments and judge the condition of the furnace. This was another difficult hurdle: there were too many clues, the relationships were too complicated, my brain often couldn't process it, and I felt very heavy in my heart. I remembered that during the puppet Manchukuo era, it took ten or twenty years to become a technician. I'm thirty-four this year, and in twenty years I'll be fifty-four! My hair will be white! There's no end to this!

I told Old Zhou about these feelings, and I said, "I'm worried that I'm learning too slowly. Didn't you also say that it will take a little longer for workers to become technicians, like twenty years?"

Old Zhou quickly said, "Hey! I said that when you didn't have any confidence yet. No matter how slow, it won't take twenty years. Why do you still believe these words now? If someone says it will really take you twenty years to learn, it's because they themselves are decades behind. Haven't you seen what's happened in our factory in the past two years? Things that the Japanese devils never dreamed of in the past, we've done now... Learning technology is like building a building. You must lay the foundation well, and then build it up layer by layer. You can't have this impatient mood now."

I thought he was right! My problem is that I'm impatient. After this conversation, we signed a brotherly contract: If I didn't study hard, he would scold me hard. If he didn't teach me well, I wouldn't be polite to him either. From then on, I never got emotional again.

Not long after signing the brotherly contract, I began to learn how to comprehensively judge the condition of the furnace, which was the most difficult stage of learning. He explained it to me in detail in class, and he also wrote simple materials for me to take home to ponder after class. It was eight or nine li from the factory to my home. At that time, I didn't have a bicycle, so I had to walk for an hour or two. Usually, I would walk with a companion and chat while walking. During this time, I was just walking alone with my head down, constantly thinking about the things that were said in class, testing myself, and sometimes it was really hard, and when I couldn't remember, I would take out the paper that Old Zhou wrote for me to take a look, and then think about it again.

But my time was running out. When I got home, I still had to fetch water, hold the children, and buy firewood, rice, oil, and salt. If I didn't do these things, I could free up a lot of time. One day, during dinner, I said to my wife, "I'm learning to be a technician now, and I've been learning for more than two months. It's a bit difficult, but I can handle it. It's just that I feel like I don't have enough time. You have to take on more of the housework. You should also go out and buy things, and don't let the children cling to me after work..."

At first, she didn't really care. I told her how I entered the technical school, how I was assigned to learn to be a technician when I returned to the factory, how Old Zhou taught me, and how I studied. I also took out the diagrams that Old Zhou gave me and that I copied and drew myself for her to see. Finally, I also told her that Communist Party members have to take the lead in everything, that I am the first one, that I have to set an example, and that all the workers are on this path. She finally understood. In the end, she said, "If you're really studying, just throw the money at home, and you don't have to worry about the housework. I can do the work of fetching water and going to the street. When you work the night shift and need to sleep during the day, I'll take the children away so they don't disturb you. Just concentrate on learning!" This is the family contract I signed during my studies.

Success in Learning, But Still Need to Continue Learning

After that, my enthusiasm for learning grew day by day. Sometimes, I studied from day to night, until one or two o'clock in the morning before going to sleep, and got up at five o'clock the next day. At this time, Old Zhou also kept a particularly close eye on me, questioning me every day and lecturing to me all night. After studying like this for four months, Old Zhou asked me to practice operating. I first proposed the handling opinions, and if he said "That's right," I would do it. If I judged wrong, he would correct me. After studying for five months, Old Zhou made the decisions on all major matters, and I did all the general matters. Sometimes I made a small deviation, but there were no accidents. At this time, I saw that the workers were particularly enthusiastic towards me, and the old and prudent Old Brother Li also happily said, "Our workers are really good! We've produced a technician!"

In the last few days of my sixth month of studying, a technician was transferred away from our blast furnace. The factory sent a notice asking me to formally work on shift. I quickly ran to the factory director and said, "No, I've only been studying for so little time, how can I work on shift?" The factory director said, "It's okay! Everyone says you can do it, so just do it!" I officially worked on shift on March 1st. I was very careful and didn't dare to be careless. Whenever something happened, I would always ask a few more people before making a decision. I always felt that it was better to ask more than to ask less, and the engineers and technicians were also willing to help me.

At that time, the factory was holding a patriotic production competition, and the slogan we put forward was: "Learn from Soviet experience, strive for advanced coefficients, and strive for no off-grade iron for the whole month." After the joint efforts of the workers inside and outside the furnace, until the 30th, we didn't produce any off-grade iron. Everyone was so happy, and the workers in the whole furnace were about to get the glorious big red flag. But when I took over the middle shift (3:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m.) on the 30th, the first tap of iron was fine, but the second tap produced a furnace of high-sulfur off-grade iron. When I saw the iron sample, I couldn't help but cry anxiously. When I got home, I had a nightmare, and I woke up crying from the dream.

The next day at work, I saw that Old Zhou was making a self-criticism to the blast furnace workers, saying that he didn't write well in the handover log, and that he was also responsible for the off-grade iron. I knew that Old Zhou was comforting me. This gave me a big warning. I'm far from good enough, and I need to continue learning. When our four-shift制的 amateur school is set up, I will learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry from scratch, and let Old Zhou teach me metallurgy from scratch. Ironmaking is my lifelong career, and I must do it until I'm old and learn until I'm old.

    我是怎样由工人变成技术员的
    李凤恩讲
    杜印  符自强  邢慧聪整理
    编者按：李凤恩是东北某炼铁厂第一个用速成法培养出来的高炉技术员。这篇报告生动地说明了李凤恩如何克服困难，努力钻研，终于成为一个优秀的技术员的经过。东北某炼铁厂的工人们听了李凤恩的报告后，都提高了信心，努力学习。这篇报告用作者亲身经历批判了某些人不相信工人能学成技术员的观点。
    新中国使我得到学习的机会
    我生在一个工人家庭里。在旧社会的时候，我父亲是炼铁厂抬大筐的工人，他省吃俭用，好不容易才在我十四岁时把我送入小学。我刚刚读了一年零七个月的书，又因为学校开运动会时我没钱作童子军制服，就被赶出了学校。从此，我和父亲一道做杂活。十八岁那年，就开始在炼铁炉上当炉前工。
    东北全境解放，人民政府接收了炼铁厂，生产一天天发展，工人的觉悟也一天天提高，不久，我就加入了共产党。我们从此结束了苦难的生活，大家精神百倍地、紧张地进行着生产建设。
    前年十二月某天，党委书记辛瑞清把我找去，对我说：“老李呀！你不是老念着连自己的名字都写不好吗？现在叫你上技术工人学校去学习，提高文化，回来好学技术，……”没等他把话说完，我就乐的笑出声来了。
    到技工学校学了一个星期，我就碰了一个大钉子——算术才考二十分。我就有些灰心。组长李承宣耐心地劝我：“学习就是开头难，好比走路一样，开头走，不知多远，心里没底，但走着走着，看着头了，就有劲了。”后来我们小组订了合同，大伙帮助我学习，我不懂的就问。有时，老师得教三遍四遍。第二个星期我就考了四十几分，第三个星期考了六十分，以后越考越好，最后考了一百分。
    技工学校学习完了，一道回厂的十一个人，一个一个都分配了工作，最后才分配到我，人事科长说：“李凤恩，你到二高炉跟技术员周传典学习技术，学好了当技术员，我们工人要把劳动和技术结合起来，不光在炉外作主，还要在炉内作主。你是头一个，希望你给大家先做个榜样。”我一听这话感到很突然，心想：“这是怎么回事呢，我一年零七个月的文化程度，这回才上六个月学，就学了这么点事，还能学当技术员吗？伪满国高（初中）毕业的学生，还得先干七、八年信号员，才当组长，当了组长还得干上十年，才能当技术员呢。国民党呢，技术员都是大学毕业的，坐飞机来的。就是现在，技术员也都是大学生，那还有个学的！”但我一看大伙都没意见，连下就把我的意见噎回去了，没吱声，心里却不是滋味，十五个吊桶打水，七上八下的。又想到共产党员千万不能把工作撂下去提意见，我得先做去，有意见往后再提吧。我就到第二高炉去了。
    “共产党员不应该向困难低头！”
    进技工学校以前，我在一高炉当信号员，对二高炉的工人也很熟，但是二高炉的四个值班技术员还不完全认识。我拿着介绍信，上了二高炉的楼梯，正打算进信号室，只见迎面来了一个人，带眼镜，满脸是灰，两手漆黑，看样子是刚出完铁。我问他：“周技术员在哪？”他瞅我一眼说：“有什么事，我就是。”我就把介绍信递给他。他看完信，马上拉着我的手进了屋，好像他早就认识我一样。
    我怕他不了解我，抢着给他作自我介绍。他没等我说完就说：“知道知道，温厂长和党委书记王峰同志都跟我谈了。你不要客气。我值班的日子也不多。你有实际经验，咱们互相帮助。”他一直没放开我的手，和我脸对脸地说话。他开始就给了我一个好印象。
    以后他一边工作，一边领我到各处看看，然后跟我合计：“老李！咱们当技术员要能指挥炉内操作，就得简单地懂得一些炉子里的化学变化，学习一些起码的浅显的理论知识，对不对？”“对嘛，你就给我讲吧。”我嘴里这么说，心里可捏了一把汗，不知听懂听不懂呢？
    于是抽下班的时间，他就给我讲了两个晚上，同时也是为了了解我的程度。我越听越糊涂，他讲一遍不懂，再讲一遍还是不懂。我过去只知道矿石就是矿石，不知道它还有那些成份。二氧化矽是个什么东西，我一点也不知道。什么氧化过程、还原过程啦，更使我稀里糊涂。虽然不懂，但我觉得很新鲜，我就用在技工学校的老办法：问。上班的时候我跟着老周，见什么我都问，一天到晚有问题。可是不论他怎么告诉我，许多事情我还是不懂，这可把我愁坏了。
    正在我发愁的那几天，有一回，我从厂长室开会回来，走到一高炉下面，看见在楼上调度室门口站着几个人。只见他们直冲着我指指点点地不知唠些啥。等我上了楼，走到他们跟前，他们就不讲了。我知道没好话。过后我找着石忠宪（他是我一手教出来的信号员），问他。起先他不说，直问我：“你学的怎么样了？”我说：“有点困难！”
    “你可要好好学呀！”我觉得这话里有话。问他，他还不说。我就假装要跟他急眼，他这才说了：
    “我告诉你，你可别闹情绪啊！”
    “不能，你说吧！”我说。
    “他们说，上级这回可没长好眼睛。挑来挑去，挑了个李凤恩学技术员。他只有一年多的文化程度，讲文化，比他高的有的是；讲工龄，比他长的有的是，他又不比谁多个脑袋！你瞅着吧，没个学的！”他说到这儿换了口气，鼓励我说：“我告诉你了，你可不能闹情绪呀，得更加油学习，叫他们看看工人究竟能不能学成技术员。”
    我还没死心，又找着个年老持重的工人，问他：“老栗二哥！你看我学这玩艺是不是够呛！”他见我的口气已经有八成不带劲，咂了半天嘴，最后说：“困难，是比较困难点！……可也行！……赶着学吧！”他越是这么说，越叫我瞅出来他是从心眼里觉得我不能学好啊！听了这些话后，我的确有些灰心失望了。
    回到厂里，周技术员教我看铁样子，告诉我“铁热了。”我说：“好！”
    他告诉我铁花多了，怎么怎么的。我点点头，不吱声。周技术员发觉我不带劲，问我：“今儿你怎么了！有什么心事吗？”我说：“没有。”他说：“不对，你平常不是这样，一天到晚有问题，今天特别不高兴。为什么？”我看实在瞒不住了，就一五一十地把实话都说了。他说：“你听了这些话怎么想的？打算怎么办呢？”
    “他们说的都是实在话呀，他们告诉我趁早回头，我就是学不好嘛！开头我就没信心！”他把我招呼到信号室，对我说：“老李：我正想找你谈谈，支部书记跟我研究了你的学习问题。我正想向你作个检讨。过去我教的方法不对头。一开始我不该给你讲那么些理论，使你感到困难。你当过信号员，又当过炉前工，你了解很多的实际情况，这是你学习的有利条件。过去我没好好根据你这些有利条件来教你，这是我的错。从今天起，咱们把教的和学的方法都改变一下，你就能学下去了。只要能学下去，那怕学的慢点也不要紧！”以后他还说了好多宽我心的话。
    过后支部书记又找我，并批评我：
    “共产党员不应该向困难低头！群众说你的怪话，你应该反过来把它当成督促自己进步的力量，学好给大家看看，用事实打破大家的保守思想！”
    果然，周技术员改变了教的方法：先叫我抄分析单子，不讲理论，全从实际出发，教会了一样才教另外一样，没有明显事实表现的都先不给我讲，并且都用些日常的事情给我打比方，使我一听就懂。我的学习情绪又渐渐稳住了。
    兄弟合同和家庭合同
    我一气学了两个月，就把第一个阶段学完了。第三个月是学习掌握各种计器，判断炉况。这可又碰到了难关了：头绪太多，关系太复杂，脑子常常转不过来，心里好沉重。又回想起伪满时要学成一个技术员，得十年二十年，我今年三十四，再过二十年就是五十四岁了！头发都白了！这还有个头！
    我把这些心情告诉了老周，我说：“我愁的是学的慢。你不也说过吗？工人学成技术员会慢一点的，得二十年吗？”
    老周连忙说道：“唉！我那是在你连一点信心还没有的时候说的，再慢，也用不了二十年哪。你怎么到现在还信这些话呢？如果有人说你真要二十年才能学会，那是因为他们自己落后了几十年。这两年咱们厂里的事情你没看到吗？过去日本鬼子连做梦都想不到的事，现在咱们都做到了……学技术跟盖大楼一样，一定要把地基打好，然后一层一层地往上盖。你现在这个急躁情绪可要不得。”
    我想他说的对呀！我的毛病可不就是急性病。这次谈话后，我们又订立了兄弟合同：我要不好好学，他就使劲说我。他要不好好教，我也不客气地说他。从此，我再也没闹过情绪。
    订了兄弟合同不久，我就开始学习综合判断炉况，这是学习最困难的阶段。他在班上给我详细的讲，下班还写简单的材料让我带回家去琢磨。从厂到我家有八、九里地，那时我还没有自行车，就得走个把钟头。平常我都搭个伴，一边走一边唠扯。这阵子，我只是一个人低着脑袋，一个劲地琢磨在班上讲的那些东西，自己考自己，自己别自己，有时别的真够呛，实在想不起来了，就掏出老周给我写的纸单瞅一眼，完了再琢磨。
    可是我的时间越来越不够用了。我回家还得挑水，抱孩子，柴米油盐都得我去买。我要不做这些事，就能凑出好些时间来。有一天，在吃饭的时候，我就跟我的妻子说：“我这阵正在学习当技术员哪，已经学习两个多月了，困难嘛是困难点，可也能对付下来了，就是觉着时间太少了，家里的事你要多担负点，你也锻炼锻炼去买个东西的，下班别叫孩子紧缠着我，……”
    最初，她还不大以为然。我就把我怎么进的技工学校，回到厂里怎么又被分配学当技术员，老周怎么教我，我怎么学的，都跟她说了。我还把老周给我讲的，我自己抄的、画的那些图样都拿出来给她看。最后我还给她说了共产党员干什么都得带头，我是头一个，要做出榜样来，大伙工人都是这条道。她这才想通啦。最后她说：“你要真是学习的话，你只把钱往家一扔，家里的事你就不用管了，挑水、上街我都能干。你上夜班，白天要睡觉，我就把孩子抱走，不叫他们吵着你。你就一心一意地学吧！”这就是我在学习期间订的家庭合同。
    学成功了，但还得继续学习
    以后我学习的劲头一天比一天大，有时候，从白天一直学到半夜一、两点钟才睡，第二天五点钟就起来。这时候，老周抓得也特别紧，天天考问我，夜班一劲儿给我讲。就这样学到第四个月，老周就叫我练习操作了。我先提出处理意见，他说“对了”，我就做。我要判断错了，他就给我纠正。学到第五个月，凡大事由老周决定，一般的事就都交给我干了。有时候我也出点小偏差，但是没有出过事故。这时候我见工人对我特别热乎，那个年老持重的老栗二哥也高兴地说：“咱们工人真不错！还出了个技术员！”
    在我学习的第六个月快完的那几天，我们高炉上调走一个技术员。厂部送来一个通知，叫我正式值班。我赶紧跑去找厂长，我说：“不行啊！我学习这么两天，那能值班呢？”厂长说：“行啊！人家都说你行，你就干吧！”三月一号我就正式值班。我非常小心，不敢大意，遇事总要多问几个人后才下决定。我总觉得多问比少问好，而工程师、技术员们也都愿意帮助我。
    那时厂里正搞爱国主义生产竞赛，我们提出的口号是：“学习苏联经验，争取先进的系数，争取全月不出号外铁”。经过炉内炉外工人一起努力，一直到三十号，一次号外铁也没出，你瞅大伙这个高兴劲儿，全炉工人眼看就要得到光荣的大红旗了。可是三十号的中班（下午三点——十一点）我接班时，头一次铁出的还好，第二次就出了一炉高硫号外铁，我一瞅铁样子就止不住急的哭起来。回家我就做了个恶梦，从梦里哭醒了。
    第二天上班，只见老周正在向高炉工人作检讨，说他在交班簿子上没写好，出号外铁也有他的责任。我知道，老周是宽我的心。从这给我个好大一个警惕。我还差得远，我还要继续学。等我们四班制的业余学校办起来，我就从头去学数理化，让老周给我从头讲冶金学。炼铁是我终身的事业，我一定要做到老，学到老。（附图片）
