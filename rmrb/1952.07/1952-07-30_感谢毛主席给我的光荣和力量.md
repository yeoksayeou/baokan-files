Reader's Letter:

    Thank Chairman Mao for the Glory and Strength He Gave Me
    Editor: My name is Yuan Yue'e, and I am a military dependent from Hunan Province.

    I have two daughters, and originally, I didn't want them to leave my side for even a moment. Soon after Hunan was liberated, they said they wanted to join the army, and I was reluctant to let them go. But then I remembered how good our army really is, and I finally let them go. After my daughters joined the army, I was still a little worried. I asked their father to go and see them. When their father came back, he said to me, "Our daughters are in Chairman Mao's care, they've gained weight; they've learned how to fight, and they've also learned to read. They're really just like men." From then on, I was completely relieved.

    After the land reform, my family was allocated land, and our life greatly improved. The neighbors all called me a "Glorious Mother." In meetings and queues, they always let me go first. During the New Year and other festivals, the People's Government sent money and gifts, and the villagers came to offer their condolences with gongs and drums, just like a wedding. During the spring plowing season, the People's Government provided loans for seeds and fertilizer, and the mutual aid team came to help with the farming, making the fields meticulous and tidy. My husband and I are both over sixty years old, our hair has long turned white, and we used to have dark, haggard faces, but now we have both gained weight and our faces have become rosy. The villagers said to me, "You are blessed!" Yes, I am blessed. I told the villagers that this blessing was won by the People's Liberation Army and given by Chairman Mao.

    Chairman Mao gave me blessings, and I don't know what kind of energy he also gave me. This sixty-year-old person can still carry water by the river and chop firewood in the mountains. When I'm free, I mobilize the military dependents in the district to make sock liners and military shoes, and together we send the sock liners and military shoes to the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea. Although I cannot go to the front lines to directly kill American devils, my heart is always with my daughters, with the People's Liberation Army, and with the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    When commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, I especially thought of the good life after liberation, and I thought of the glory and strength that Chairman Mao gave me. I thank Chairman Mao. I am willing to tell my daughters: In order to defend our happy life, you must fight even more bravely on the front lines of defending the motherland! I am determined to work hard in production, strive to produce more grain, support our children, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers!

### 感谢毛主席给我的光荣和力量

    感谢毛主席给我的光荣和力量
    编辑同志：我叫袁悦娥，是湖南省的一个军属。
    我有两个女儿，本是一步也不让她们离开我身边的。湖南解放后不久，她们便说要去参军，我舍不得她们去。但又想起我们的军队实在很好，我终于让她们去了。女儿们到了部队以后，我仍有点不放心。我叫孩子的爸爸去看了一趟。孩子的爸爸回来对我说：“女儿交给毛主席，长胖了；学了打仗，也学了文化。真是和男子一样。”从此，我万分的放心了。
    土地改革后，我家分了地，生活大大改善。邻舍都称我是“光荣妈妈”。开会、排队总要让我在前头。过年、过节，人民政府给我家送钱、送节礼，老乡们敲锣打鼓地来慰问，真像办喜事。春耕时，人民政府贷给粮种、肥料，有互助组来代耕，地里弄得精精致致的。我和孩子的爸爸都六十多岁了，头发早白了，以前总是一副焦黑的脸，现在都长胖了，脸也变得红润了。乡亲们对我说：“你有福气啦！”是有福气了，我告诉乡亲们说，这福气是解放军给打出来的，是毛主席给的。
    毛主席给了我福气，不知还给了我一股什么劲头。我这六十多岁的人，还能到河边担水，能上山砍柴。我闲着的时候，便动员区上的军属妇女们做袜底、军鞋，一同把袜底、军鞋寄到抗美援朝总会。虽然我不能上前线去直接杀美国鬼子，但是我的心总是和我的女儿们，和解放军，和人民志愿军战斗在一起！
    当纪念“八一”建军节的时候，我特别想起了翻身后的好日子，想起了毛主席给我的光荣和力量。我感谢毛主席。我愿意告诉女儿们：为了保卫我们的幸福生活，你们要更英勇地战斗在保卫祖国的最前线！我决心努力参加生产，争取多打粮食，支援孩子们，支援人民志愿军！湖南军属  袁悦娥
