    The Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan Should Be Attributed to the Leadership of the Communist Party
    Chen Shaoxian, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    Today, fifteen years ago, the Chinese people launched the famous "July 7th" War of Resistance. After eight years of arduous struggle, they finally defeated the ferocious Japanese imperialism and achieved victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. When we drink water, we must remember the source, and we should attribute the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the mobilization and victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan would be unimaginable.
    After the "September 18th" Incident, Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang adopted a policy of non-resistance towards Japanese imperialism, and intensified its anti-communist and anti-people civil war. Japanese imperialism took the opportunity to advance step by step, and the Chiang bandit gang retreated repeatedly, signing many traitorous treaties like the "He-Umezu Agreement" one after another. At this critical stage, we saw the disastrous measures of the Chiang bandit gang, which aroused unparalleled anger and strengthened our determination to resist Japan and save the nation. The Chinese Communist Party issued the call for a "National United Front Against Japan" in northern Shaanxi. In our view, this was truly good news for saving the national crisis. But the Chiang bandit gang was still not awakened, and instead put forward the absurd proposition of "internal pacification before external resistance," further forcing Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to continue attacking the Red Army. Zhang and Yang refused and detained Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an. The Communist Party advocated a peaceful resolution, and Chiang bandit was released. When Chiang Kai-shek was detained, I was also one of those who hoped to kill Chiang bandit. I felt quite regretful when Chiang bandit was released. Later, I realized that this was my wrong idea. Due to the realization of domestic peace, when the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the nationwide War of Resistance Against Japan was launched from then on.
    In the early stage of the War of Resistance, the troops of Japanese imperialism marched straight in. Some people had an unclear understanding of the prospects of the war and produced erroneous thoughts such as "quick victory theory," "weapons-only theory," and "national subjugation theory." Chairman Mao wrote the book "On Protracted War," pointing out the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This book played a huge role in the ideological leadership of the Chinese people's resistance against Japan, encouraging and strengthening the courage and confidence of the people across the country to win the War of Resistance.
    Since the Chiang bandit gang's participation in the War of Resistance was forced, seeing the masses rising up to resist Japan, he was afraid that it would endanger his rule, so he feared the masses and even canceled the national salvation organizations. After the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Chiang bandit gang became even more passive in resisting Japan, fleeing to Chongqing to sit and watch the outcome, and plotting to use Japanese troops to eliminate the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. However, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which truly persisted in resisting Japan, were not only not eliminated, but developed day by day. As a result of the Chiang bandit gang's implementation of reactionary policies, his army became increasingly corrupt and weakened. In the Xianggui Campaign, they collapsed without a fight, and even the rear of the War of Resistance—South China—fell into enemy hands.
    In contrast, the Chinese Communist Party has always adhered to the "National United Front Against Japan." Its slogans and propositions have become the foundation and goal of the people across the country to unite in resistance. It led the people across the country to fight against Japanese imperialism, and the Communist Party members stood at the forefront of the battle, and their heroic deeds of bloodshed and sacrifice became models for the masses. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we shattered the Japanese imperialists' invasion and Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to surrender, and finally, with the help of the great Soviet Red Army, won the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan!
    The Communist Party not only led the Chinese people to victory in the War of Resistance, but also led the Chinese people to preserve the fruits of victory. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang hiding in Chongqing flew out, colluding with US imperialism to swallow the fruits of the people's victory. US imperialism also took the opportunity to replace Japanese imperialism in China. If the Communist Party had not led the Chinese people to rise up and overthrow the US imperialist's running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, not only would the Chinese people lose the fruits of victory, but China would also be reduced to a colony of US imperialism.
    Now, US imperialism is still vainly attempting to use a small group of Chiang Kai-shek's remnants in Taiwan to be enemies of the Chinese people. At the same time, it is frantically rearming Japan, and instructing the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to collude with Japanese militarists and politicians who once invaded China to jointly oppose the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have already defeated Japanese imperialism and overthrown the US-Chiang reactionaries. Moreover, the situation today is completely different from the past. The strength of the Chinese people has grown, China and the Soviet Union have formed an iron-like alliance, the Japanese people have also become unprecedentedly awakened, and are resolutely opposing the US imperialist occupation of Japan and carrying out a heroic struggle for national independence. The people of Asia and the world who love peace want to defend peace. Now is no longer the era when robbers can run rampant. Today, as we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance, we must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, enthusiastically participate in the production increase and economy practice movement, the ideological remolding movement, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and strengthen preparations for the liberation of Taiwan.
    Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will forever advance, further advance, on the road to victory!

### 抗日战争的胜利应归功于共产党的领导

    抗日战争的胜利应归功于共产党的领导
    中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员  陈劭先
    在十五年前的今天，中国人民展开了历史上有名的“七七”抗战，经过了八年的艰苦奋斗，终于打垮了凶恶的日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的胜利。我们饮水思源，应该把抗日战争的胜利归功于中国共产党的领导。没有中国共产党的领导，中国人民抗日战争的发动和胜利，都是不可想像的。
    “九一八”事变后，日本帝国主义侵占了我国的东北，蒋介石匪帮对日本帝国主义采取不抵抗政策，而变本加厉地进行反共反人民的内战。日本帝国主义乘隙步步进迫，蒋匪帮便节节退让，接二连三地订下了很多像“何梅协定”之类的卖国条约。在这个严重的阶段，我们看见蒋匪帮祸国殃民的措施，更激起了无比的愤怒，同时，也更坚定了抗日救亡的主张。中国共产党在陕北发出了“抗日民族统一战线”的号召，在我们看来，这真是一个挽救民族危机的福音。而蒋匪帮还不觉悟，反而提出“攘外必先安内”的荒谬主张，更进一步逼迫张学良、杨虎城继续向红军进攻。张、杨不服，在西安扣留了蒋介石，共产党主张和平解决，才将蒋匪释放。当蒋介石被扣的时候，我也是希望杀蒋匪的一人，蒋匪被释了，我颇引以为憾。后来才认识到这是我的错误想法。由于国内和平实现，到了“七七”芦沟桥事变一起，全国规模的抗日战争从此就发动了。
    抗战初期，日本帝国主义的军队长驱直入，一些人对战争前途认识不清，产生了“速胜论”、“唯武器论”“亡国论”等错误思想。毛主席写了“论持久战”一书，指出了抗日战争必胜的前途。这本书对中国人民抗战的思想领导起了极大的作用，鼓舞了和坚定了全国人民抗战必胜的勇气和信心。
    蒋匪帮参加抗战既然是被迫的，他看到群众起来抗日，恐怕要危及他的统治，便害怕群众，竟至取消救亡团体。武汉、广州相继失守，蒋匪帮对抗战更加消极，逃到重庆去坐观成败，阴谋假手日本军队去消灭八路军和新四军。然而真正坚持抗日的八路军和新四军不但没有被消灭，反而日益发展了。而蒋匪帮执行反动政策的结果，他的军队日益腐化了削弱了，湘桂战役不战而溃，连抗战的后方——华南也沦陷于敌手。
    与此相反，中国共产党一直坚持着“抗日民族统一战线”，它的口号和主张成为全国人民团结抗战的基础和奋斗目标。它领导着全国人民和日本帝国主义进行战斗，共产党员更站在战斗的最前线，流血牺牲的英勇事迹，成为群众的模范。由于中国共产党的领导，我们就粉碎了日本帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石投降的阴谋，最后在伟大的苏联红军的帮助下，赢得了抗日战争的最后胜利！
    共产党不但领导中国人民取得抗战的胜利，并且领导中国人民保住了胜利的果实。抗战胜利以后，躲在重庆的蒋介石匪帮飞出来了，他们勾结美帝国主义，要吞食人民胜利的果实。美帝国主义也就乘机取代了日本帝国主义在中国的地位。要是没有共产党领导中国人民起来打倒美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮，不但中国人民胜利的果实要失去，中国还要沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    现在美帝国主义还妄图利用台湾一小撮的蒋介石残匪来和中国人民为敌，同时更疯狂地重新武装日本，并指使蒋介石残余匪帮勾结曾经侵略中国的日本军阀、政客，共同来反对中国人民。但是在中国共产党领导下的中国人民，早已打败过日本帝国主义，打垮过美、蒋反动派，何况今天的情形和从前绝不相同，中国人民的力量已经壮大起来了，中苏两国已经结成了钢铁一般的同盟，日本人民也已经空前地觉悟了，坚决反对美帝国主义占领日本，为民族独立进行英勇的斗争；亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民都要保卫和平。现在已经不是强盗们横行霸道的时代了。我们今天纪念“七七”抗战的十五周年，更加要在中国共产党的领导下热烈地参加增产节约运动、思想改造运动和抗美援朝运动，并加强准备解放台湾的工作。
    中国人民在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，永远在胜利的道路上前进，再前进！
