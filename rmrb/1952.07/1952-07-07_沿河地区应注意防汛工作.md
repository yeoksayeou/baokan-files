    Flood Prevention Work Should Be Emphasized in Riverine Areas
    To the Editor: In Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, on the night of June 8th, the tide surged violently, causing 19 breaches in the Henghe Dike in the four districts along the river.

    The main reasons for the dike breaches were: rural cadres in the riverine districts neglected the Henghe Dike repair project. The county People's Government had set deadlines for the repair of the Henghe Dike three times, but it was never completed. Some cadres have a very serious bureaucratic work style. Comrade Tang Shoujia, Secretary of the Qixi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, did not know about the serious situation of the dike breach in Weimin Township until five days after it happened.

    After discovering the dike breach, the county People's Government immediately sent people to inspect, and in addition to designating the local district and township cadres to conduct profound self-criticism and imposing penalties on derelict cadres according to their respective situations, and notifying each district of the dike breach situation, starting from June 15th, it also transferred more than a dozen responsible cadres from various departments directly under the county to go deep into the districts to mobilize the masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the dikes, and immediately reinforce them where dangers were found. According to the instructions of the higher-level government: "This year, the tide season in Zhejiang, Fujian and other regions has arrived early and the water is very strong," indicating that this year's flood prevention task is significant. The county People's Government and all districts and townships must strengthen leadership and urgently mobilize cadres and the masses to participate in the flood prevention campaign. Fan Zhongping

    沿河地区应注意防汛工作
    编辑同志：苏北启东县六月八日夜潮水暴涨，沿江四个区的横河堤决口十九处。
    决堤的主要原因是：沿江区乡村干部忽视横河堤的整修工程，县人民政府曾三次限期整修横河堤，但一直没有完成。有些干部官僚主义作风十分严重，启西区中共区委书记汤守家同志对卫民乡决堤的严重情况，在事后五天还不知道。
    县人民政府发觉决堤情况后，立即派人前往检查，除指定当地区乡干部作深刻检讨，对失职干部分别情况予以处分，并把决堤情况通报各地区外，从六月十五日起又抽调了县的直属机关各部门十多个负责干部，深入各区发动群众，对堤防进行全面检查，发现险要立即培修。根据上级政府指示：“今年浙闽等地区潮汛提早，水势甚猛”，说明今年防汛任务重大，县人民政府和各区乡必须加强领导，紧急动员干部与群众，投入防汛运动。范仲萍
