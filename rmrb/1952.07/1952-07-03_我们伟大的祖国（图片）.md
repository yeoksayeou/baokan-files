    Our Great Motherland
    Along the banks of the Songhua River in Northeast China, there is beautiful scenery everywhere. During holidays, many people come to stroll along the river or row boats on it. This is the surface of the Songhua River near Harbin. In the distance is the Songhua River Railway Bridge, and the two female students standing in the foreground are gazing into the distance by the river.
