    New Victory on the Kaesong Front
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Shu
    The sound of gunfire and artillery from the banks of the Sachon River on the Kaesong front is shaking the conference tents at Panmunjom. The American generals, who are trying to intimidate people with so-called "military pressure," have recently been launching provocative offensives there, but each time they have been met with a heroic counterattack by the defenders of Kaesong.
    On July 6, more than one squad of the seventh company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, guarding the front-line positions of Height 123.9, with the firepower support of brother units, once again repelled an attack by more than one battalion of the U.S. Marine Corps First Division. At the cost of one killed and three wounded, they achieved a victory of annihilating 250 enemies, and also captured 13 light machine guns, five heavy machine gun barrels, nine carbines, and 24 American rifles.
    The front-line position of Height 123.9 is located east of the Panmunjom conference area, with only a mountain separating the two places. In late March of this year, the American invaders transferred the so-called elite troops of the Marine Corps First Division to the vicinity of Panmunjom and launched many attacks on this height, vainly attempting to exert their "military pressure." But the First Marine Division has gained nothing except for the heavy casualties of more than 3,000 people.
    The First Marine Division's attack on July 6 changed the previously failed plans for dawn or daytime attacks, and attempted to occupy the position with a sudden night attack. During the day, they used many aircraft and artillery groups to bombard the front-line positions of Height 123.9 for a whole day. At 10:30 p.m., they secretly concentrated more than one battalion of troops and stealthily approached the front-line positions in three routes without firing a single shot. Our brave soldiers discovered them when the enemy was more than 100 meters away from the position; when the enemy crawled closer to about 30 meters, they used hand grenades to meet them. After being attacked, the enemy hurriedly released many flamethrowers, and streams of fire sprayed onto the position. At this time, Deputy Platoon Leader Li Man, who was directing the battle, was wounded in the head and his right hand was also burned by the flames, but he insisted on staying on the front line and shouted: "Comrades, resolutely defend Kaesong and don't let a single enemy go back alive!" The soldiers were all a hundred times more courageous, braving the smoke and fire, and threw grenades and flying mines at the rushing enemy. At the same time, the heavy machine guns and small cannons of the brother units on both sides also flanked the enemy. The position was flashing with fire and billowing with smoke; amidst a series of explosions, there were cries of wounded enemies. After a short but fierce battle, the enemy's many charges were repelled.
    Later, the enemy officers forced their soldiers to charge, but none of the enemy soldiers dared to walk in the front, which resulted in the chaos of the establishment and formation, and they crowded onto the position like a flock of sheep. Our soldiers waited for the enemy to get close, and then fiercely threw many flying mines and anti-tank mines. In the continuous loud noises, batches of enemies fell down, and the blood of the beasts splashed on the position. Deputy Squad Leader Wan Shaoqing bravely jumped to the top of the fortification and threw the flying mines and anti-tank mines one by one. He was wounded in his right eye, but he still insisted on fighting. When soldier Mi Xiankang was about to throw an anti-tank mine, he was seriously injured in the waist. However, the safety fuse of the anti-tank mine in his hand had been twisted off, and releasing it would cause an explosion and injure the nearby soldiers. Therefore, he endured the severe pain and tightly pinched the anti-tank mine. When the medic bandaged him, he asked the medic to send the anti-tank mine to other soldiers to throw it out. Under the brave attack of our soldiers, the enemies scrambled to escape for their lives. Some rolled down the mountain in order to leave the battlefield faster, and some lay on the ground and crawled backwards for fear of our machine gun fire. In the rout, many people were knocked down, and even trampled on, making strange noises. When they retreated to the foot of the mountain, and were noisily reorganizing their disorganized troops, our army's artillery, hidden in the mountains, suddenly fired at them together. As a result, the enemies scattered and fled again with the earth-shattering explosions, but most of them were knocked down after only a few steps. At this time, the enemy's artillery attempted to counterattack, but was immediately suppressed by our army's powerful artillery fire. When our army's artillery fire stopped, a chorus of enemy cries came from the foot of the mountain.
    The brave soldiers vigilantly guard the positions on the Kaesong front every day. The American invaders' so-called "military pressure" cannot scare the powerful Chinese and Korean People's Army. The soldiers said: "We can make the enemy sit down and negotiate, and we will resolutely support our negotiators!"

    开城前线的新胜利
    新华社记者  王殊
    从开城前线砂川河畔传来的枪炮轰鸣声震撼着板门店的会议帐篷。妄图以所谓“军事压力”唬吓人的美国将军们最近又在那里不断地发动挑衅进攻，但是每一次都遭到开城保卫者们的英勇回击。
    七月六日，守卫一二三点九高地前沿阵地的志愿军某部第七连的一个多班，在兄弟部队的火力支援下，又一次击退美国海军陆战队第一师一个多营的进攻。他们以牺牲一名、负伤三名的代价，取得歼敌二百五十名的胜利，并且还缴获轻机枪十三挺、重机枪枪筒五个、卡宾枪九支、美式步枪二十四支。
    一二三点九高地的前沿阵地在板门店会场区东侧，两地之间仅隔一座山。今年三月下旬，美国侵略者把所谓精锐部队海军陆战第一师调到板门店附近，对这个高地进行了许多次攻击，妄想以此施行他们的“军事压力”。但是陆一师除掉已经付出三千多人的惨重伤亡外，一无所得。
    陆一师七月六日那一天的进攻，改变了过去已多次失败的拂晓或白天进攻的计划，企图用突然的夜间攻击来占领阵地。当日白天，他们用许多飞机和炮群向一二三点九高地的前沿阵地轰击了一整天，到夜晚十点半钟，他们偷偷地集中了一个多营兵力，不打一枪一炮，分成三路偷摸到前沿阵地来。我们英勇的战士们在敌人进到离阵地一百多公尺以外时就发现了他们；等到敌人爬近到三十多公尺时，就用手榴弹来迎击他们。敌军受到打击后急忙将许多具火焰喷射器一齐施放，一股股烈火喷射到阵地上来。这时，指挥作战的副排长李满的头部负了伤，右手也被火焰烧伤了，但是他坚持不下火线，高喊道：“同志们，坚决保卫开城，不让一个敌人活着回去！”战士们个个奋勇百倍，冒着浓烟烈火，把手榴弹和飞雷摔向扑上来的敌人。同时，两侧兄弟部队的重机枪和小炮也一起夹击敌人。阵地上火光闪闪，烟尘飞腾；在一片爆炸声中夹杂着受伤敌人的哭叫声。经过一场短促而激烈的战斗，敌人的好多次冲锋都被打退了。
    后来敌人军官们还逼着他们的士兵冲锋，但是敌兵们没有一个敢走在前面，结果把建制和队形都弄得混乱了，像羊群似地拥上阵地来。我军战士们等敌人靠近后，就猛烈投出许多飞雷和反战车雷。在接连不断的巨响中敌人一批批地倒了下去，阵地上飞溅着野兽们的鲜血。副班长万绍青英勇地跳到工事顶上，把飞雷和反战车雷一个个摔出去。他右眼负伤，但仍坚持战斗。战士弥显康正要投出反战车雷时，腰部负了重伤。但是他手里的反战车雷的保险丝已经扭断了，一松手就会引起爆炸，伤害旁边的战士。因而他忍住剧痛，紧紧地捏住反战车雷。当卫生员替他包扎时，他叫卫生员先把反战车雷送给其他战士投出去。敌人在我们战士的勇猛的打击下，个个争相逃命，有的为了快一些离开战场就从山上滚下去，有的怕我机枪扫射伏在地上向后爬。敌人在败退中，有许多人被挤倒了，甚至被踩得怪声大叫。当他们溃退到山脚下后，正吵吵嚷嚷地收拾乱作一团的部队时，隐藏在群山中的我军大炮突然一起向他们发射。于是敌人又随着震撼山岳的爆炸声四散逃命，但多数人只走了几步就被击倒了。这时敌人的大炮企图还击，但立刻被我军强大的炮火压住。当我军炮火停止时，从山脚下传来了一片敌人的哭叫声。
    英勇的战士们每天警惕地守卫着开城前线的阵地。美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”是吓不倒强大的中朝人民军队的。战士们说：“我们能够打得敌人坐下来谈判，我们坚决给我们的谈判代表撑腰！”
