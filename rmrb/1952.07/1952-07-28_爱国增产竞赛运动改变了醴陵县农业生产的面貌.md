The Patriotic Increase Production Emulation Drive Changes the Face of Agricultural Production in Liling County

Zhou Jishun, Secretary of the Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hunan Province

Since the spring ploughing season, Liling, Hunan has carried out a patriotic increase production emulation drive throughout the county. This year, all kinds of farming activities have been done better than in previous years. Every district, township, and team in the county has conducted evaluations and summaries after each agricultural activity. The masses' production enthusiasm has always been high.

Leadership and Assistance from the Party and State-Owned Farms

The Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pays close attention to the leadership of agricultural production. Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League have played a pioneering role in the increase production emulation drive. At the beginning of the movement, the County Committee instructed all rural branches and all party members to actively participate in the patriotic increase production emulation drive, strengthen and enrich branch life in the movement, and further enhance the party's combat effectiveness and close the ties between the party and the masses. The party and Youth League branches discussed the County Committee's instructions, formulated production plans, made guarantees, and participated in the increase production emulation drive. The County Committee also strengthened the leadership of propaganda networks and teaching stations. All localities designated Sundays as collective teaching or learning days, strengthening the party's political leadership and ideological education of the peasant masses. This has powerfully promoted the patriotic increase production movement.

In the increase production emulation drive, state-owned farms have played their due demonstrative role. The County Farm has challenged twelve farms, including Changde Farm. The County Farm's plan is to achieve an average yield of 1,500 jin of rice per mu on 203 mu of land; 1,700 jin of rice per mu on 4 mu of high-yield demonstration plots; and an average yield of 700 jin of jute per mu on 50 mu of land. The farm attaches great importance to phased fertilization and soil improvement. This year, the farm added 400 dan of vegetable soil and 150 dan of ditch manure to each mu of land, increasing the topsoil thickness by an average of 1.5 inches. The farm conscientiously implemented the principles of more fertilizer, deep ploughing, and close planting. The farm absorbed the farming experience of labor models and experienced farmers, and promoted this experience to the masses, playing a good demonstrative role. The County Farm has become a vocational school for farmers. Every night, many farmers go to the farm to study techniques and exchange experiences. Many people have learned the farming methods of the farm.

Overcoming Ideological Obstacles of Cadres and the Masses

The patriotic increase production emulation drive has been carried out in the process of constantly overcoming various ideological obstacles. After the land reform and review, the individualistic ideas of some rural cadres gradually became exposed. Some wanted to go home and rest, some felt they had "low education and few methods" and were afraid that the work would be too much to handle if the emulation drive was launched. Some were unwilling to work in the countryside and wanted to go to urban agencies or requested to be transferred to other jobs. Some believed that "production does not need leadership, the masses will produce themselves." Some only saw that some middle peasants already had the conditions for increasing production, but did not see the many difficulties faced by poor and hired peasants who had just been allocated land and had very little to start with. Some cadres even believed that "poor and hired peasants have no production tools and cannot form mutual aid teams."

The masses' "eating from the big pot" mentality and the fear of increasing burdens and "sticking out" were quite prevalent. The idea that "production has reached its peak and cannot be improved further" was also very common. Farmers in seven districts across the county generally did not believe in Li Chenggui's high-yield experience. Some said, "Li Chenggui's land has good soil quality and good water conservancy, we cannot compare with him." Some said, "Our land here is already very fertile, we cannot apply more fertilizer."

In order to solve these ideological problems, the Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first launched a propaganda campaign on the ten major policies of agricultural production throughout the county, and through this propaganda, launched a campaign to learn from Li Chenggui's advanced experience throughout the county. Qingshui Township and Luojia Township found the most productive households in the township and used facts familiar to the peasants to educate them, which was very effective. The county trained more than 2,800 high-yield activists before the spring ploughing and then let these activists and labor models promote them to the masses, breaking the masses' various conservative ideas.

Among the cadres, two "battlefield rectification" campaigns (rectification during work) were conducted, establishing the idea of long-term construction of the countryside, commending good cadres, criticizing individualistic ideas among cadres, and clearly pointing out the direction of organizing to develop production, initially overcoming the phenomenon of ideological confusion. In this way, the increase production emulation drive could be carried out with leadership.

Timely Inspection, Evaluation, and Summarization to Promote the Movement Forward

It is very important to conduct timely inspections, evaluations, and summaries when production has reached a certain stage. This can gradually push the movement forward. According to the statistics of fifteen districts, 429 townships have carried out evaluations and summaries; of which 116 have carried out twice, and 26 have carried out three times. According to the statistics of 140 townships, more than 48,600 men and 31,800 women participated in the evaluation summary, accounting for more than 40% of the total population of these townships.

The evaluation movement is carried out from bottom to top. First, resident groups and mutual aid teams conduct evaluations between households and between people, then conduct evaluations of groups against groups in the whole township, and finally conduct evaluations of townships against townships in the whole district. The emulation conditions proposed by each unit when challenging and responding to challenges are taken as the criteria for evaluation. The good and bad are evaluated, and the reasons for the good and bad and the existing problems are identified. After discussion by the masses, concrete solutions to the problems are put forward. In a mutual aid team in Liutang Township, District 7, two widows (Yang Donghui, Yang Huayao) did not complete the plan, and the team was rated as a Grade C team. After repeated analysis by the whole team, it was believed that the reason why they did not complete the plan was that the team did not give full play to the spirit of class friendship and did not provide enough care for the households in difficulty. After the evaluation, Yang Yunlian, the leader of the women's team, took the lead in helping the two widows and solved the problem.

After the group and township evaluations, a district-wide evaluation is carried out. Representatives participating in the evaluation evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of individuals, mutual aid teams, and townships, summarize experiences and lessons, convey them back to the peasants in the township, and propose plans for the next stage. Some places also visit advanced groups and townships on-site during the evaluation to specifically exchange production experiences. Evaluation is a good method for the masses to educate themselves. It can both clear up thinking and introduce experience, promoting the movement to continue to move forward.

Competition Promotes the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

The competition movement has promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement, enabling many farmers who have not yet been organized to truly recognize the benefits of being organized and have a desire to be organized. Under the leadership of the Hu Shaoqing mutual aid team in Huacaqiao Township, District 14, 194 of the 235 households in the township participated in the rice transplanting mutual aid team, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of households in the township. Therefore, the entire township completed the rice transplanting task in four days. According to the statistics of 336 townships, a total of 7,621 temporary rice transplanting mutual aid teams were organized during the rice transplanting movement, and the number of participants accounted for more than half of the total labor force. The county completed the rice transplanting task five to ten days earlier than last year, saving more than 46,000 man-days and saving materials worth more than 430 million yuan in Renminbi.

The competition movement has also increased the enthusiasm of cadres and activists. After Xiangchang Liu Qingfang of Dongjia Township responded to the challenge from other townships, he paid close attention to inspecting production work and took the initiative to contact the supply and marketing cooperative to order bean cake fertilizer. After the land reform review, militiaman Lai Jisheng had a slackening of thought. After the competition movement started, he became active again, defending the public security of the whole township and actively participating in production, wanting to strive to join the League on the production front. Cadres and activists actively led the masses in the movement, and their contact with the masses was also closer than in the past.

The patriotic increase production emulation drive enabled more women to participate in field labor and mutual aid teams. In the competition movement, villages began to organize busy-season nurseries or baby-holding teams (District 7 alone organized 228), which solved the problem of many women taking care of their children during production and gave full play to the women's production enthusiasm. According to the statistics of 318 year-round mutual aid teams in nine districts, a total of more than 4,700 laborers participated in the mutual aid teams, of which more than 2,000 were women.

Striving to Overcome Coercive Orders and Formalism

There are still serious shortcomings in the current competition movement that must be overcome. Various forms of coercive order style have appeared in some districts and townships. Cadres in Liuba Township, District 13, proposed in the locust control that "whoever does not catch insects or is not active will be charged with sabotaging production." Shi Xingen, the township chief of Chaicheng Township in District 7, in order to compete for the red flag, said to the farmers that whoever did not catch insects would be tied up. These cadres have fallen ill with impatience or have ideas of championshipism. When leading production, cadres in some townships only pay attention to "making a big fanfare" and are satisfied with "making a great show," while neglecting to solve problems deeply and concretely. Some are busy running around and are unwilling to go deep into mobilizing the masses. Some use the excuse of "taking care of everything" and take holding meetings as the only method of leadership. If this style is allowed to develop, it is very dangerous. In order to further carry out the patriotic increase production emulation drive, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the mass line and the work style of arduous and in-depth work.

### 爱国增产竞赛运动改变了醴陵县农业生产的面貌

    爱国增产竞赛运动改变了醴陵县农业生产的面貌
    中共湖南醴陵县委书记  周继舜
    湖南醴陵从春耕以来，在全县范围内开展了爱国增产竞赛运动。今年各种农事作得都比往年好。全县每个区、乡、组，在每一个农事活动结束后，都进行了评比总结。群众的生产情绪始终是饱满的。
    党和国营农场的领导和帮助
    中共醴陵县委十分注意对于农业生产的领导。共产党员和青年团员在增产竞赛中起了先锋作用。运动开始的时候，县委就指示全县农村支部和全体党员，积极参加爱国增产竞赛运动，并在运动中健全和充实支部生活，更进一步地发挥党的战斗力，密切党和群众的联系。党和团的各个支部都讨论了县委的指示，纷纷订出生产计划，提出保证，参加增产竞赛。县委又加强了对宣传网、传授站的领导，各地都定星期日为集体传授日或学习日，加强了党对农民群众的政治领导和思想教育。这就有力地推动了爱国增产运动。
    在增产竞赛运动中，国营农场发挥了应有的示范作用。县农场已向常德农场等十二个农场应战。县农场的计划是使二百零三亩田每亩平均产稻谷一千五百斤；使四亩高额丰产田每亩产稻谷一千七百斤；使五十亩黄麻每亩平均产麻七百斤。农场很重视分期施肥和改良土壤。今年农场在每亩田中加了四百担菜土、一百五十担沟粪，平均加厚表土一寸半。农场认真地实行了多肥、深耕、密植。农场吸收了劳动模范和老农们的耕作经验，又把这经验推广到群众中去，起了很好的示范作用。县农场已成为农民的业余学校。每晚有许多农民去农场研究技术、交流经验。许多人都学习了农场的耕作方法。
    克服干部和群众的思想障碍
    爱国增产竞赛运动是在不断克服各种思想障碍的过程中开展起来的。在土地改革和复查结束后，某些农村干部个人主义思想逐渐暴露出来。有人想回家休息休息，有人感到“文化低，办法少”，怕竞赛起来工作吃不消。有人不愿在农村工作，想到城市机关里去，或要求转业。有人认为“生产不需要领导，群众自己会生产”。有人只看见一部分中农已有了增产的条件，却没有看见新分到田而底子很空的贫雇农，还有许多困难。有的干部甚至认为“贫雇农没有生产工具，不能成立互助组”。
    群众中的“吃大锅饭”的思想和怕增加负担、怕
    “冒尖”的思想曾经是相当普遍的。“生产到顶了，不可能再提高了”的思想也是很普遍的。全县有七个区的农民普遍不相信李呈桂的丰产经验。有的说：“李呈桂的田土质好，水利好，我们比不了他。”有的说：“我们这里的田本来就很肥，不能再多上肥料了。”
    为了解决这些思想问题，中共醴陵县委首先在全县范围内展开了农业生产十大政策的宣传运动，并通过这次宣传，在全县展开了学习李呈桂的先进经验的运动。清水乡、骆家乡找出全乡收获最多的丰产户，用农民熟悉的事实，对农民进行教育，收效很大。全县在春耕前训练了二千八百多个丰产积极分子，再让这些积极分子和劳动模范向群众宣传，打破了群众的各种保守思想。
    在干部中，进行了两次“战地整风”（在工作中整风），树立了长期建设农村的思想，表扬了好的干部，批评了干部中的个人主义思想，明确指出组织起来发展生产的方向，初步克服了思想混乱的现象。这样，增产竞赛运动才有领导地开展起来了。
    及时检查、评比、总结，
    推动运动前进
    在生产告一段落时，及时地进行检查、评比、总结，是十分重要的。这可以把运动逐步推向前进。据十五个区的统计，进行过评比、总结的乡已有四百二十九个；其中进行过两次的有一百一十六个，进行过三次的有二十六个。参加评比总结的人口，据一百四十个乡的统计，有男人四万八千六百多人，妇女三万一千八百多人，占这些乡总人口的百分之四十以上。
    评比运动是自下而上地开展的，先由居民组、互助组进行户和户、人和人的评比，然后进行全乡的组和组的评比，最后进行全区的乡和乡的评比。评比时以各单位挑战应战时所提的竞赛条件为标准，评比出好坏，并找出好坏的原因和存在的问题，经群众讨论，提出具体解决问题的办法。七区六塘乡的一个互助组中有两个寡妇（杨冬慧、杨华尧）没有完成计划，这个组被评成了丙等组。经过全组一再分析，认为她们没有完成计划的原因，是组内没有发挥阶级友爱精神，对困难户照顾不够。评比以后，妇女组长杨运连就带头帮助两家寡妇，把这个问题解决了。
    组、乡评比以后，就进行全区的评比。由参加评比的代表，评出个人、互助组和乡的优劣，总结出经验教训，回乡向农民传达，并提出下一阶段的计划。有的地方还在评比中到先进的组、乡实地参观，具体地交流生产经验。评比是群众自己教育自己的好方法，它既能打通思想，又能介绍经验，推动运动继续向前开展。
    竞赛推动了互助合作运动
    竞赛运动推动了互助合作运动，它使许多还未组织起来的农民，真正认识到组织起来的好处，有了组织起来的要求。十四区花草桥乡在胡绍卿互助组带动下，全乡二百三十五户，就有一百九十四户参加了插秧互助组，占全乡总户数百分之八十以上，因此，全乡四天就完成插秧工作。据三百三十六个乡的统计，在插秧运动中共组织了七千六百二十一个临时插秧互助组，参加的人数占总劳力的一半以上。全县比去年提早五天到十天完成插秧任务，并节省了人工四万六千多个，节省物力值人民币四亿三千多万元。
    竞赛运动还提高了干部和积极分子的积极性。东家乡乡长刘清芳向其他乡应战以后，十分注意检查生产工作，并主动和供销合作社联系，订购枯饼。民兵赖纪生在土地改革复查后，曾经发生了松懈思想。竞赛运动开展以后，他又积极起来，保卫全乡治安，积极参加生产，要争取在生产战线上入团。干部和积极分子在运动中积极带动群众，和群众的联系也比过去密切了。
    爱国增产竞赛运动使更多的妇女参加了田间劳动和互助组。在竞赛运动中，各村开始组织农忙托儿所或抱娃娃组（只第七区就组织了二百二十八个），解决了许多妇女在生产时的带孩子的问题，发挥了妇女的生产积极性。据九个区三百一十八个常年互助组统计，参加互助组的劳动力共四千七百多人，其中妇女就有两千多人。
    努力克服强迫命令和形式
    主义作风
    目前的竞赛运动中还有严重的缺点必须加以克服。某些区乡出现了各种形式的强迫命令作风。十三区柳坝乡干部在治蝗中提出“谁不去捉虫，谁不积极，以破坏生产论罪”。七区柴城乡乡长石辛根为了争红旗，对农民说，谁要不捉虫，就把他捆起来。这些干部犯了急性病或有锦标主义的思想。某些乡的干部在领导生产时，只注意“大张旗鼓”，满足于“轰轰烈烈”，而忽视了深入具体地解决问题。有的忙于东奔西跑，不愿深入发动群众。有的藉口“照顾全面”，而以开大会作为唯一的领导方法。这种作风，如果任其发展下去，是很危险的。为了进一步开展爱国增产竞赛运动，必须认真贯彻群众路线和坚苦深入的工作作风。
