	Eradicate Bureaucracy That Disregards Mass Accusations

	The case of Wang Gaosheng and Yang Zhiwen, who violated laws and regulations in Wen County, Pingyuan Province, is appalling. What deserves special attention here is that the heinous crimes of Wang Gaosheng and others, such as shielding and harboring heinous counter-revolutionaries and raping women, were not exposed for as long as three years! Why is this? We believe that one of the most important reasons is that the leading Party and government organs in Wen County adopted a completely intolerable attitude of disregard towards the accusations of the masses. Over the past three years, many people and cadres have reported and accused Wang Gaosheng and others of their crimes to the leading organs of Wen County. However, the leading organs of the county did not pay attention to these accusations. As long as Wang Gaosheng and others said "I won't admit it until I die," everything was fine. Under such serious bureaucratic leadership, any violations of laws and disciplines would occur and develop. They emphasized that the accusers "have prejudice" against Wang Gaosheng and that the accusers "have a bad history and impure family"; but why not look back at Wang Gaosheng's consistent corruption and bribery and his history of being sentenced, and Yang Zhiwen's history of serving as a bandit soldier? They emphasized that these were "minor problems." But what are "major problems"? They often arbitrarily believe that this "may not be true" (the above words in quotation marks are quoted from the preliminary inspection of the Wen County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China on the case of corruption, perversion of justice, violation of laws and disciplines by the Wen County People's Court), but why not think about it the other way around, that it "may be true"? Isn't Wang Gaosheng's and others' dirty history worth investigating? What else can this explain besides their strong bureaucratic, sectarian sentiments and their criminal, playful attitude towards the revolutionary cause? This extremely serious bureaucratic style of disregarding the opinions of the masses and sectarian sentiments actually played a role in protecting and condoning corrupt and law-breaking elements! This style stifles public opinion, blocks the ears and eyes of the Party and the People's Government organs, prevents them from receiving criticism and supervision from the masses, and shuts themselves in small houses!

	Comrade Stalin taught us, "We must not weaken our ties with the masses for a moment, let alone sever our ties with the masses." "We must listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, we must listen carefully to the opinions of ordinary Party members, we must listen carefully to the opinions of so-called 'unimportant people,' we must listen carefully to the opinions of the people." He also said, "As long as the Bolsheviks maintain their connection with the broad masses, they will certainly be invincible. - This can be said to be a law. Conversely, as soon as the Bolsheviks separate themselves from the masses, lose their connection with the masses, and become infected with the disease of bureaucracy, they will lose all their strength and become empty shells." The leading cadres in Wen County should carefully understand these valuable teachings of Comrade Stalin.

	The People's Government Committee of Pingyuan Province decided at its meeting on June 23: "We must find out the reasons why the case was not discovered for three years, and the root causes of why the masses did not directly report to us or why we could not detect it even if they did, in order to learn from this lesson and thoroughly overcome bureaucracy." This decision is completely correct and necessary. The reasons for and responsibility for the failure to expose the violations of laws and disciplines by the Wen County Court for three years must be investigated, and those cadres who have committed serious bureaucratic errors must be given strict criticism and due punishment. The people's governments at all levels in other regions, especially the judicial organs, should also combine this case to examine their own work in order to strengthen their ties with the people and attract the people to supervise our cadres and work.

### 肃清漠视群众控告的官僚主义

    肃清漠视群众控告的官僚主义
    平原省温县法院以王高升、杨治文为首的违法乱纪案件是骇人听闻的。这里值得特别注意的是：王高升等包庇纵放罪大恶极的反革命分子、强奸妇女等滔天罪行，竟至三年之久未被揭发出来！这是为什么呢？我们认为：最主要的原因之一，是温县的党、政领导机关对群众的控告采取了完全不能容忍的漠视态度。三年来，曾有很多群众和干部向温县领导机关反映和控告王高升等的罪行。但该县领导机关对这些控告是不加以注意的。只要王高升等来个“死不承认”，就没事了。在这样严重的官僚主义领导下，任何违法乱纪的罪行都会发生和发展的。他们强调控告者对王高升“有成见”，强调控告者“历史不好，家庭不纯”；但是，为什么不反过来看一看王高升一贯贪污腐化、曾被判刑的历史和杨治文当过匪军的历史呢？他们强调这是“小问题”。但什么是“大问题”呢？他们常常武断地认为这“可能不是事实”（以上引号内的文字系引自中共温县县委关于温县人民法院贪赃枉法违法乱纪案件的初步检查），但为什么不反过来想一下，也“可能是事实”呢？难道王高升等的污秽的历史不值得审查一下吗？这除了说明他们有着浓厚的官僚主义、宗派主义情绪和对革命事业抱着罪恶的儿戏态度之外，还能说明什么呢？这种极端严重的漠视群众意见的官僚主义作风和宗派主义情绪，实际上起了包庇和放纵贪赃枉法分子的作用！这种作风，使群众舆论被扼杀，使党和人民政府机关耳目闭塞，不能得到群众的批评和监督，而把自己关闭在小房子里！
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“一刻也不可减弱我们与群众的联系，更不必说隔断我们与群众的联系了。”“必须仔细倾听群众的意见，必须仔细倾听平常党员的意见，必须仔细倾听所谓‘无关重要的人’的意见，必须仔细倾听人民的意见。”又说：“只要布尔什维克保存着他们与广大群众的联系，那他们将一定是必胜不败的。——这可以说是一个定律。反之，布尔什维克只要一脱离群众，一丧失自己与群众的联系，一染上官僚主义的毛病，那他们就会丧失任何的力量，而变成空架子。”温县的领导干部应该好好体会一下斯大林同志这些可贵的教言。
    平原省人民政府委员会在六月二十三日的会议上决定：“一定要找出该案三年之久未被发现的原因，及群众不直接向我们反映或虽有反映而我们不能察觉的根源，以便接受这一教训，彻底克服官僚主义。”这一决定是完全正确的、必要的。温县法院的违法乱纪案件三年之久未被揭发的原因和责任必须查清，对那些犯有严重官僚主义错误的干部必须给以严格的批评和应得的处分。其他地区的各级人民政府，特别是司法机关，也应结合这一案件，检查自己的工作，以加强和人民群众的联系，吸引人民群众来监督我们的干部和工作。
