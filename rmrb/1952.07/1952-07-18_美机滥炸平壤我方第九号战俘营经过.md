Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th. U.S. air pirates systematically bombed our No. 9 POW camp, located in the suburbs of Pyongyang, on the night of the 11th. The camp building is a tall structure with POW camp markings in white letters on a red background, as agreed upon by both sides in the armistice negotiations. The U.S. Air Force saw these very clear markings during the day, but they carried out a barbaric bombing of the POW camp at night, completely violating the agreement.

On the night of the 11th, at around 11:00 PM, U.S. aircraft began indiscriminately bombing the area centered on the No. 9 POW camp. At 1:00 AM on the 12th, two bombs landed on the exercise field in front of the POW dormitory. At 2:10 AM, six bombs landed on the roof of the barracks. At 2:30 AM, another bomb landed near the dormitory. According to detailed investigations afterwards, fifteen Rhee Syngman puppet army prisoners of war who were sleeping at the time were killed (thirteen were found on the spot), seventy-two were wounded, and many others are missing. Two large rooms upstairs and downstairs, and one grain warehouse were destroyed, and three other bungalows were collapsed.

The entire medical staff and personnel of the POW camp risked their lives to rescue the wounded prisoners of war during the indiscriminate bombing by U.S. aircraft and transferred the remaining prisoners to caves and other safe locations, greatly reducing the casualties among the prisoners. All the wounded prisoners were sent to hospitals for treatment within a few hours.

    美机滥炸平壤我方第九号战俘营经过
    【新华社平壤十七日电】美国空中强盗十一日夜间有计划地轰炸了我方设在平壤近郊的第九号战俘营。这个俘虏营的营房是一座高大的建筑物，房顶上按照停战谈判双方的协议置有红底白字的俘虏营标志。美国空军在白天是看到这个非常显明的标志的，但他们在夜间对战俘营进行了完全违反协议的野蛮轰炸。
    十一日夜间十一时左右，美机即开始滥炸以第九号战俘营为中心的周围地区。十二日晨一时俘虏宿舍前的运动场上落弹两枚，二时十分营房房顶落弹六枚，二时半宿舍附近又落弹一枚。据事后详细调查，当时正在睡觉的李承晚伪军俘虏共被炸死十五人（当场发现的有十三人），炸伤七十二人，另有许多人下落不明。楼房上下各两大间与粮食仓库一间被炸毁，另有平房三间被炸塌。
    战俘营的全体医护人员与工作人员，在美机滥炸时冒险抢救负伤俘虏，并把其余俘虏转移到窑洞和其他安全地点，大大减少了俘虏的伤亡。负伤俘虏在数小时后即被全部送往医院治疗。
