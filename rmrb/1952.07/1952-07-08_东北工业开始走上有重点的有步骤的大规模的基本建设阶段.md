    Northeast Industry Begins to Enter a Stage of Large-Scale Basic Construction with Emphasis and Steps
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    After three years of recovery and some development, the proportion of state-owned and public-owned industries in the total industrial output value of the Northeast Region will increase from 78.3 percent in 1951 to 81.5 percent this year, exceeding the highest level of total industrial production value of the puppet Manchurian regime in 1943. This year, state-owned and public-owned industries can basically complete the recovery work. In order to accelerate the future development of industry and further enhance national defense and economic strength, the Northeast People's Government began large-scale basic construction in state-owned and public-owned industries with emphasis and steps in 1952. The state has invested a large amount of funds in industrial basic construction this year, and the total amount of industrial basic construction projects has increased by 125 percent compared with last year. In industrial basic construction, according to the principle of concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry and national defense industry, the proportion of investment in heavy industry accounts for more than 82 percent. This year, the investment of the Northeast Industrial Department in industrial basic construction, the new construction (including transformation) projects account for 90 percent of the total investment.
    The transition of Northeast state-owned and public-owned industries from recovery to large-scale basic construction with emphasis and steps is an extremely important change in the development of Northeast industry. This change is an important step in the transition of the new China from a long-term backward agricultural country to a modern industrialized country. In order to adapt to this major change, the Northeast People's Government has made a decision to strengthen the work of basic construction. At the same time, it is also proposed that the work of basic construction should be put in the primary position in the leadership and management of state-owned industries.
    Industrial basic construction work directly embodies the state's guidelines and policies for national defense construction and economic construction. The quality of industrial basic construction work is not only related to the saving and waste of national wealth at present, but also affects the future of industrial development, the speed of development, and whether the country's resources are rationally utilized. In order to do this work well, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Strengthening the Leadership of Basic Construction" in July last year, and in March this year promulgated the "Decision on the Management of Basic Construction Work in 1952", which focused on clarifying the important significance of basic construction work and the necessity of strengthening leadership and management. Cadres of all enterprises have studied these decisions and carried out ideological mobilization from top to bottom. Many cadres began to realize that strengthening the leadership and management of basic construction is the decisive key to doing a good job in basic construction.
    At present, the industrial basic construction work in Northeast China is being carried out from all aspects.
    Now all enterprise units are actively enriching the cadres of the basic construction departments and improving the organization of the basic construction departments. For example, a certain company has three deputy managers specially responsible for leading basic construction, the number of departments managing basic construction has increased from two to twelve in the past, and professional engineering companies have been organized, and 17 department-level cadres, 50 section-level cadres, and 150 technicians have been transferred from the production departments to supplement the basic construction departments. According to the needs of the project scale, the Coal Mine Administration has successively transferred more than 800 cadres from the production departments to work in the basic construction departments. These cadres include engineering company managers, section chiefs, team leaders, and a large number of skilled technicians. In the past, the factories under the Mechanical Administration did not have basic construction organizations, and now they have also transferred a group of cadres from the production departments to establish various organizational structures. Due to the large number of cadres added to the basic construction departments, the leadership of the basic construction departments of each unit has been greatly enhanced. The strength of the basic construction departments of some units has exceeded the strength of the production departments. This is of decisive significance for completing this year's basic construction plan.
    However, industrial basic construction is a long-term economic construction work, and China is a technologically backward country, so it is very necessary to actively and massively cultivate the reserve forces for basic construction. The Northeast People's Government has attached importance to this work, requiring that at least 40,000 technicians be trained this year, and the civil engineering and construction sections of universities and secondary technical schools be expanded, requiring that at least one school (secondary technical school) take civil engineering and construction as the main subject. In addition, various enterprise units have set up training classes to train various technical talents.
    Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improving design work have been raised to a very important position in this year's basic construction work. In the past, many designers adopted the design methods of capitalist countries when conducting design, and arbitrarily expanded the safety factor with conservative technical viewpoints. For example, many factories originally had small loads, but the foundations and columns designed by the designers exceeded the required standards, wasting a lot of steel and cement, causing serious losses to national assets. In order to improve the design work, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government convened a civil engineering and construction engineering conference for research. According to the Soviet design standards, combined with the specific conditions in Northeast China, the "Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings" were formulated. This new design standard can reasonably and greatly reduce the safety factor of the design. For example, the new design standard stipulates that the live load on the floor can be reasonably reduced by an average of about 30 percent compared with the past; the wind pressure standard can be reasonably reduced by more than 50 percent compared with the past; the allowable stress of wood and steel can be reasonably increased by about 20 percent compared with the past... The new design standards fully illustrate the superiority of the Soviet design standards. The implementation of new design standards can save the country 10 percent of its investment in civil engineering and construction this year, and create favorable conditions for fully realizing the effectiveness of investment in the future. All enterprise units have organized designers to study the new design standards. In the study, many designers criticized the conservative design thinking of the bourgeoisie and realized the superiority of the Soviet design standards. In the new design projects of many enterprise units this year, due to the more widespread adoption of the new design standards, a large amount of materials and funds have been saved for the country. For example, the Civil Engineering and Construction Design Company of the Northeast Industrial Department saved more than 300 cubic meters of concrete and more than 30 tons of steel bars by designing nine projects according to the new design standards. After adopting the new design standards, the Senior Vocational School of Architecture of the Nonferrous Metals Administration reduced the original design cost of 1.3 million yuan per square meter of construction to 1.1 million yuan. The 15 projects designed by the Light Industry Administration using the new design standards also reduced the cost of the original design projects by 10.4% to 13%.
    Vigorously promoting advanced experience has become an important link in doing a good job in industrial basic construction this year. With the continuous improvement of the consciousness of the working class and the help of Soviet experts, Northeast industrial basic construction has created a lot of advanced experience in the past three years. In construction engineering, there are Su Changyou's segmented continuous bricklaying method, Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line operation method, and engineering indication chart system and concrete vacuum operation method; in geological drilling, there is Ma Wenzhi's team's rapid drilling method; in coal mine construction engineering, there is the parallel operation method of vertical shafts; in mechanical and electrical engineering, there is the parallel operation method of pre-assembly and foundation construction, and the assembly line operation method of power transmission lines. These advanced experiences have a significant role in improving the quality of basic construction, saving national wealth, and accelerating the speed of construction. For example, Su Changyou's segmented continuous bricklaying method reasonably organizes labor and implements the "double-handed slurry squeezing method", which increases labor efficiency to 400 percent. This not only reduces the cost of the project, but also greatly solves the difficulty of lacking technicians. Ma Wenzhi's team's rapid drilling method reasonably organizes labor and shortens the time for auxiliary operations, so that the drilling progress has been increased from an average of 3 meters per day to 8.34 meters, and the current maximum has reached 31 meters. This has accelerated the progress of coal mine geological survey work and reversed the situation in which project construction was delayed due to difficulties in resource investigation in the past. In order to vigorously promote these advanced experiences, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions convened a work conference of the Construction Trade Union and issued the "Instructions of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions on Strengthening the Trade Union Work in Basic Construction", calling on trade unions at all levels to do a good job in trade union work in basic construction in order to promote advanced experience in an organized and planned manner. According to this instruction, the construction trade unions in various places have set out the goals for promoting advanced experience. The four cities of Harbin, Shenyang, Anshan, and Changchun are preparing to train 1,040 Su Changyou-style advanced teams within two months after the construction begins. Two months after the construction begins, they will strive to universally promote Su Changyou's bricklaying method in the city's new construction projects. Qiqihar City plans to enable more than 20 percent of the city's technicians to learn new working methods within two months. Recently, in order to enable the various advanced experiences of basic construction to be widely promoted in the Northeast Region, the Northeast Industrial Department convened a conference on the promotion of advanced experiences in basic construction. The participants in the conference included workers, technicians, management cadres from various basic construction departments of the Northeast Industrial Department, and representatives from basic construction departments of various provinces and cities in Northeast China, totaling more than 3,000 people. After visiting the performances of various advanced experiences and the exhibition of nearly 100 kinds of new tools, they generally recognized the superiority of advanced experience and the importance of promoting advanced experience in doing a good job in basic construction. Even some people with conservative ideas have changed their understanding. For example, Gu Wanzhen, a worker from Liaoyang Construction Company, thought that "there is nothing to see" when the company sent him to visit, and he was not very willing to come, but after visiting the performance of Su Changyou's team, he said: "This method is really good." He wrote down the operation method of Su Changyou's team. In order to implement the spirit of this conference, the Northeast Industrial Department called on its affiliated enterprise units to complete the following indicators in this year's work of promoting advanced experience: 1. Su Changyou-style bricklayer teams and Xie Wanfu-style carpenter teams should be promoted to 80% of all bricklayer and carpenter teams. 2. Ma Wenzhi-style teams should be promoted to 50% of all drilling teams. 3. More than 50% of the construction projects of vertical shafts and inclined shafts in coal mines should adopt the parallel operation method. 4. All power transmission line projects in the electric power industry should adopt the assembly line operation method. 5. The concrete vacuum operation method should be completely and successfully implemented on four different types of large concrete projects. In order to complete this indicator, all enterprise units are launching a upsurge of promoting advanced experience among employees.
    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee called on the local party committees of all provinces and cities to transfer a large number of capable cadres to the construction site to vigorously strengthen the political work in basic construction. This measure is a powerful guarantee for discovering and promoting advanced experience. Many enterprise units have begun to attach importance to this work. For example, recently, the Harbin Municipal Party Committee organized a political work team of 171 people and a cultural and educational service team of more than 100 people (including film projection teams, etc.) to go to the construction site to strengthen the political work and cultural and educational work among construction workers. A certain company has also established a political department in the basic construction department.
    For several months, the leadership and management of industrial basic construction in the Northeast Region have been greatly strengthened. At present, this work has basically entered the construction stage from the preparation stage, and the work is more complex and arduous. It is even more necessary to continue to strengthen leadership and management. Only in this way can we ensure the completion of this year's engineering quality indicators and complete this year's engineering plan.

    东北工业开始走上有重点的有步骤的大规模的基本建设阶段
    本报记者  古维进
    经过三年来的恢复和某些发展，今年东北区的国营公营工业在全区工业总产值中所占的比重，将由一九五一年的百分之七十八点三提高到百分之八十一点五，而超过一九四三年伪满工业生产总值的最高水平。今年国营公营工业，基本上可以完成恢复工作。为了加速今后工业的发展，进一步增强国防力量与经济力量，一九五二年东北人民政府开始在国营公营工业中进行有重点的有步骤的大规模的基本建设。国家对于今年工业基本建设投入了大量的资金，工业基本建设工程总量比去年增长百分之一百二十五。在工业基本建设中，根据集中力量发展重工业与国防工业的原则，重工业投资的比重占百分之八十二强。东北工业部今年在工业基本建设方面的投资，新建（包括改造）工程占投资总额的百分之九十。
    东北国营公营工业从恢复走向有重点的有步骤的大规模的基本建设，是东北工业发展中的一个极其重要的变化。这个变化，是新中国从长期落后的农业国开始逐渐走向现代工业化国家的重要一步。东北人民政府为了适应这个重大的变化，已作出加强基本建设工作的决定。同时并提出，在对国营工业的领导和管理上，把基本建设方面的工作提到首要的地位。
    工业基本建设工作直接体现着国家对国防建设与经济建设的方针、政策。工业基本建设工作的好坏，不但关系目前国家财富的节约与浪费，而且影响着工业发展前途、发展速度和国家资源的是否合理运用。东北人民政府工业部为了做好这一工作，在去年七月就颁布了“关于加强基本建设领导的决定”，今年三月又颁布了“关于一九五二年基本建设工作管理的决定”，着重阐明基本建设工作的重要意义和加强领导与管理的必要。各企业干部对于这些决定都进行了学习，并自上而下地进行思想动员。许多干部开始认识到加强基本建设的领导与管理是做好基本建设工作的决定关键。
    目前东北工业基本建设工作正从各方面开展起来。
    现在各企业单位正积极充实基本建设部门的干部，健全基本建设部门的组织。例如某公司以三个副经理专门负责领导基本建设，管理基本建设的处从过去两个增加到十二个，并组织了专业的工程公司，从生产部门抽调处长级干部十七名、科长级干部五十名、技术人员一百五十名补充到基本建设部门。煤矿管理局根据工程规模的需要，前后从生产部门抽调八百余名干部到基本建设部门工作。这些干部包括工程公司经理、科长、队长及大批熟练技术人员。机械管理局所属各厂过去没有基本建设的组织机构，现在也从生产部门抽调一批干部，建立各种组织机构。由于干部大批补充到基本建设部门，各单位基本建设部门的领导力量大大增强。有的单位基本建设部门的力量已超过生产部门的力量。这对于完成今年基本建设的计划具有决定意义。
    但是，工业基本建设是长期的经济建设工作，而中国又是技术落后的国家，因此积极地大量地培养基本建设的后备力量是十分必要的。东北人民政府已在重视这一工作，要求今年至少培养出四万个技工，扩大各大学和中等技术学校的土木建筑部分，要求至少有一所学校（中等技术学校）把土木建筑作为主要科。另外各企业单位纷纷开办训练班，培养各种技术人材。
    学习苏联先进经验，改进设计工作，在今年基本建设工作中被提到非常重要的地位。许多设计人员，过去进行设计都是采取资本主义国家的设计方法，以保守的技术观点任意扩大安全系数。例如有很多厂房本来荷重不大，但是设计人员设计出来的基础与柱子却超过应有的标准，浪费许多钢筋和水泥，造成国家资财的严重损失。东北人民政府工业部为了改进设计工作，曾召开土木建筑工程会议进行研究。根据苏联的设计标准，结合东北的具体情况，拟订了“建筑物结构设计暂行标准”。这个新的设计标准，可以合理地大量地降低设计的安全系数。例如新设计标准规定的楼面活荷重，可以较过去合理地平均降低百分之三十左右；风压力的标准可以较过去合理地降低百分之五十以上；木材、钢材的许可应力可以较过去合理地提高百分之二十左右……。新的设计标准，充分说明苏联设计标准的优越性。实行新的设计标准，可使国家今年在土木建筑的投资上节约百分之十，并为今后充分发挥投资效能创造有利条件。各企业单位都组织设计人员学习新的设计标准。在学习中，许多设计人员批判了资产阶级的保守的设计思想，认识到苏联设计标准的优越性。许多企业单位在本年度的新设计工程里由于较普遍地采用了新的设计标准，为国家节省了大量的材料和资金。如东北工业部土木建筑设计公司按照新设计标准设计九项工程，共节约了三百多立方公尺混凝土和三十多吨钢筋。有色金属管理局建筑高级职业学校采用新设计标准以后，把原来设计的每一平方公尺需建筑工程费一百三十万元降低到一百一十万元。轻工业管理局用新设计标准设计的十五项工程，也较原来的设计工程费用降低了百分之十点四到百分之十三。
    大力推广先进经验，成为今年做好工业基本建设的重要环节。东北工业基本建设，在工人阶级不断提高觉悟和苏联专家的帮助下，三年来创造许多先进经验。在建筑工程上，有苏长有的分段连续砌砖法、谢万福的木工流水作业法、及工程指示图制和混凝土真空作业法；在地质钻探上，有马文志小组的快速钻进法；在煤矿建井工程上，有竖井平行作业法；在机电工程上，有预先装配与基础施工的平行作业法、送电线流水作业法。这些先进经验对于提高基本建设质量，节约国家财富，加快建设速度，都具有重大的作用。例如苏长有的分段连续砌砖法，合理地组织劳动力和实行“双手挤浆法”后，劳动效率提高到百分之四百，这不但降低了工程成本，而且大大解决了缺乏技工的困难。马文志小组的快速钻进法，合理组织劳动力，缩短补助作业时间，使钻探进度从平均日进三公尺提高到八点三四公尺，目前最高已达三十一公尺。这就加速了煤矿地质勘察工作的进展，扭转以往因资源调查困难拖延工程建设的局面。东北总工会为了大力推广这些先进经验，曾召开建筑工会工作会议，作出“东北总工会关于加强基本建设中的工会工作”的指示，号召各级工会必须做好基本建设中的工会工作，以便有组织有计划地推广先进经验。各地建筑工会根据这个指示，已订出推广先进经验的奋斗目标。哈尔滨、沈阳、鞍山、长春四个市，准备在施工以后两个月内培养出一千零四十个苏长有式的先进小组。施工两个月以后，争取在全市新建工程中普遍推广苏长有的砌砖法。齐齐哈尔市计划在两个月内使全市百分之二十以上的技术工人学会新的工作方法。最近，东北工业部为使基本建设的各种先进经验能够在东北区普遍推广，召开了基本建设先进经验推广大会。参加大会的有东北工业部各基本建设部门的工人、技术人员、管理干部和东北各省市基本建设部门的代表等共三千余人。他们参观了各种先进经验的表演、和近百种新式工具的展览后，普遍认识到先进经验的优越性和推广先进经验对搞好基本建设的重要意义。即使有些思想保守的人，也转变了认识。如辽阳建设公司工人顾万镇，当公司派他来参观时，他认为“没有看头”，不大愿意来，但参观了苏长有小组的表演后，却说：“这办法真好”。他把苏长有小组的操作方法记下来。东北工业部为了贯彻这次大会的精神，号召所属企业单位，在今年推广先进经验的工作中应该完成下面几个指标：一、苏长有式的瓦工小组，谢万福式的木工小组应推广到所有瓦、木工小组的百分之八十。二、马文志式的小组应推广到所有钻探小组的百分之五十。三、煤矿的竖井和斜井的建设工程，应有百分之五十以上做到采用平行作业法。四、电业工业中送电线路工程应全部采用流水作业法。五、在四个不同类型的大型混凝土工程上应完全成功地施行混凝土真空作业法。各企业单位为了完成这个指标，正在职工中掀起推广先进经验的热潮。
    中共中央东北局号召各省市地方党委抽调大批得力干部派到工地上去，大力加强基本建设中的政治工作。这一措施是发现与推广先进经验的有力保证。许多企业单位开始重视这一工作。如最近哈尔滨市委组织一百七十一人的政治工作组和组织一百余人的文化教育服务队（包括电影放映队等），开赴工地加强建筑工人中的政治工作和文化教育工作。某公司也在基本建设部门设立了政治部。
    数月以来，东北区对工业基本建设工作的领导与管理大大加强。目前这一工作基本上已经从准备阶段进入施工阶段，工作更为复杂，艰巨，继续加强领导和管理尤为必要。只有这样，才能保证完成今年的工程质量指标，完成今年的工程计划。
