Xinhua News Agency: Zhu Zhongli is a farmer-turned-cadre from the Fifteenth District of Changsha County, Hunan. He was originally a representative of "Li SiXi Thought," and after the land reform, he developed slackening and "retreating" thoughts. Now he has overcome these harmful thoughts, possesses the qualifications of a Communist Party member, and has honorably joined the Communist Party. Recently, he reported to the training class for village cadres and activists in Changsha County on his ideological process from being a representative of "Li SiXi Thought" to becoming a Communist Party member. The following is a summary of his report.

I am twenty-five years old this year, from Nongyu Township, Changsha County, and like everyone else, I am a person who has just been liberated from the feudal land. When I was four and a half years old, my mother died in childbirth, and my poor father, who was a lacquer worker, sent me to live with my grandmother's family for seven years. From the age of twelve, I started working as a hired laborer and did it for twelve years, changing six masters. At that time, I faced the yellow earth and turned my back to the sky, working day and night, year after year, but I still couldn't make ends meet. The hateful landlords always called me: "Zhu the Cripple, Blood-Spitting Bucket, Tung Oil Jar..." They didn't even give me a name.

In August 1949, we were liberated. I was still working in the landlord's house, deceived by the landlord, living a muddled life. During the land reform last spring, the working comrades repeatedly awakened me, enabling me to actively lead the peasants to struggle against the landlords and distribute the land. Later, I was allotted more than two acres of land, four large tile-roofed houses, and I also married a wife and had children. Chairman Mao helped me start a family. Liberation, land distribution, marriage, and childbirth were truly "four joys arriving at once." I felt content. My personal idea of getting rich started to act up just after the victory of the land reform. On March 31st last year, at the township-wide celebration of the victory of the land reform, I was elected deputy township head. A big red flower was pinned on my chest, and I was happy for a while, but I immediately regretted it. My eyes were always fixed on the tip of my nose, worrying that working would delay production at home. When the working comrades talked to me, I pushed back with "four nothings": I can't read, I can't write, I can't calculate, and I can't speak. I can't do it! In reality, there were three fears in my mind: first, I was afraid that my own production would lag behind, and if production was delayed, I would have nothing to eat; second, I was afraid of offending people, that others would say I was showing off and trying to be in the limelight, and that I was afraid of being criticized by the masses for being too active; third, I was afraid that I didn't understand the government's policies, that I wouldn't be able to complete the tasks, and that I was afraid of being criticized by the leadership. In short, I was afraid of putting in effort and not getting any benefit. Later, the cadres and the masses patiently persuaded me, and I reluctantly agreed to do it.

After working for more than a month, production was not integrated with work, and my own production did lag behind. Watching the rice seedlings in other people's fields "turn dark," while my own rice seedlings "turned yellow," I became even more impatient and simply stopped going to any meetings. When the working comrades came to talk to me, I told them bluntly: "To attend a meeting, it costs eight sheng of grain a day." When someone asked me: "What if everyone stops working, what will happen if the reactionaries come?" I said: "We have Chairman Mao." I forgot that I had turned over and become the master, forgot that the landlord class and counter-revolutionaries were always plotting to stage a comeback, forgot that protecting the land and the fruits of the turn-over was the business of every turn-over peasant himself, and couldn't see the happy future of the revolution. These selfish and backward thoughts harmed me for several months.

Around the "May Day" holiday last year, I participated in nine large and small meetings to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and oppose the American imperialists' arming of Japan. In June, I also attended the district's meeting of representatives to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. During the denunciations, I cried. I remembered the atrocities of rape, arson, and murder committed by the Japanese devils when they occupied my hometown, and I understood that today the American devils are following the old path of the Japanese bandits, not letting us have a good day. I began to realize that my idea of "burying myself in production and not caring about politics" was wrong. But looking at my children and family, my heart was sometimes cold and sometimes hot. I struggled and suffered, and finally fell ill. The secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party of China and many comrades came to see me and gave me another warning: "Think about how this family came to be? If it weren't for the volunteers guarding the gate for us..." After they left, I tossed and turned and couldn't close my eyes. Before dawn, I got out of bed, "Go, follow the Communist Party forever!" I said to myself, and my wife even laughed at me for going crazy. I didn't answer, and went to the township people's government to express my determination to carry out the revolution to the end to the higher-ups.

At this time, although I had already made a one-third turn, it was not yet consolidated. In July, the higher-ups transferred me to work in Fengshan Township, and the district systematically sent a Communist Party member to help us study the history of the Communist Party of China. In the study and discussion, I thought back and forth: our victory was won by the lives of millions of revolutionary martyrs. If everyone was as slack as I was, wouldn't the blood of Liu Hulan and many other revolutionary martyrs have been shed in vain? Thinking of this, I strengthened my determination to carry out the revolution. At the same time, through comparative discussion, I further found the root of bitterness and recognized the past situation of being cruelly exploited by the landlords: my family lived in a dilapidated thatched hut, seven of my twelve sisters died due to poverty and illness, and five were given to others as child brides to suffer. The landlords also colluded with the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandit gang to arrest the working people to do hard labor and serve as soldiers. The more I thought about it, the more I hated it, and the more I felt that my slackening was wrong. Therefore, on National Day, I wrote to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing not to slacken, and that I would go wherever the motherland needed me.

But when I first turned around, I only knew that I wanted to "protect my family," and I couldn't see the distant future of the revolution. The secretary of the District Committee introduced me to the pictures of the Soviet "Red October Collective Farm," and asked me to visit many factories in Changsha City, and also watched films such as "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains," which not only brought me to Changsha, but also showed me the great construction and beautiful prospects of the motherland's people in the past two years. When I first sat in a car made by the working elder brothers and walked into the factory, my heart became even brighter: the worker brothers are with machine mass production all day long, so they are resolute, brave, and loyal to the revolutionary cause, without any personal considerations. This made me think that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class can the peasants wash away their shortcomings and move towards socialism. So I asked to join the Communist Party of China.

The Communist Party educated me, saved me, and prevented me from becoming a confused bug who only saw the little benefit under my nose, and also initially established a communist outlook on life, becoming a glorious Communist Party member. I took a detour myself and felt heartbroken. So I often use my own experience to patiently help the peasant brothers who want to "take a break" wake up.

Recently, I have been working in Xingfu Township. When hired and poor peasants have difficulties in life, I go from house to house to find out the situation and help them formulate production plans to get through the famine. When work encounters difficulties, I think of the saying that "there are no difficulties in front of Communist Party members," and I have strength and support. I know that I have not been transformed enough, and there are still many shortcomings in my work. On the eve of the Party's birthday, I made a guarantee: I will earnestly fulfill the eight conditions of a Party member, thoroughly transform the remnants and shortcomings of peasant thought in me, and be determined to carry out the revolution to the end, without wavering, retreating, or fearing bloodshed and sacrifice at any time, resolutely and faithfully implement the Party's resolutions, and strive for the cause of communism for the rest of my life.

### 农民朱中立加入了共产党

    农民朱中立加入了共产党
    新华社按：朱中立是湖南长沙县十五区的一个农民出身的干部，他原是“李四喜思想”的代表人，在土地改革后曾产生了松劲、“退坡”思想。现在他克服了这种有害的思想，具备了共产党员的条件，光荣地加入了共产党。最近他向长沙县乡村干部和积极分子训练班报告了他由“李四喜思想”代表人转变成为一个共产党员的思想过程。下面就是他的报告摘要。
    我今年二十五岁，长沙县农裕乡人，和大家一样是个刚从封建土地上解放出来的人。我四岁半，妈难产死了，做漆工的穷苦的爸爸将我寄食外婆家七年。十二岁起，我就开始了雇工生活，一直做了十二年，换了六个主人。那时，我口对黄土背对天，成年累月没早没晚地做，还糊不上口。可恨的地主总是叫我：“朱拐子、屙血筒、桐油坛……”连个名字都没有。
    一九四九年八月，解放了，我还在地主家做工，受地主的欺骗，过蒙憧日子。去春土地改革时，工作同志三番四覆地把我喊醒过来，使我曾积极领导农民斗争地主，分配土地。后来，我分得了两亩多田、四间大瓦屋，还娶了妻子，生了小孩，毛主席给我成了家。解放、分田、娶妻、生子，真是“四喜临门”，我感到心满意足。我的个人发家致富的念头在土地改革刚胜利结束时就开始作怪了。去年三月三十一日在全乡庆祝土地改革胜利大会上，我当选了副乡长，大红花挂在胸前，心里欢喜了一阵，但立刻就后悔起来。眼睛老是望着鼻子尖，担心干了工作会耽误家里生产。工作同志和我一谈起，我就推说“四不会”：一不会认，二不会写，三不会算，四不会讲，干不了！实际上思想上存在着三怕：一怕自己生产落后，耽误了生产没有饭吃；二怕得罪人，旁人说我逞能干想出风头，工作怕积极过火要受群众批评；三怕我不懂得政府的政策，任务完不成，怕领导上批评。总之是怕费力不讨好。后来，干部和群众都耐心劝我，才勉强答应干。
    干了个多月，生产没有结合工作，自己的生产果然落了后，眼望着人家田里禾苗“发乌”，自己禾苗“变黄”，心里更不耐烦，就干脆开什么会都不去了。工作同志找我谈，我就直截了当对他说：“要开会八升谷一天。”有人问起我：“假如大家都不干工作，反动派来了怎么办？”我说：“有毛主席在。”我忘记了自己翻身作了主人，忘记了地主阶级、反革命分子时刻在阴谋死灰复燃，忘记了保田、保翻身果实是每个翻身农民自己的事，更看不到革命的幸福前途。这自私落后的念头，一直害了我好几个月。
    去年“五一”节前后，我一连参加了九次控诉日寇暴行和反对美帝国主义武装日本的大会、小会，六月间还出席了区里抗美援朝代表会。在控诉中，我哭了。我想起了日本鬼子侵占家乡时奸淫烧杀的暴行，明白了今天美国鬼子正在走着日本强盗的老路，不让我们有一天好日子过。我开始发觉自己“埋头生产、不问政治”的想法错了。但是望着自己的孩子和家庭，心里总是冷一阵、热一阵。我斗争、苦恼，终于病倒了。中共区委书记和许多同志都来看我，又给我敲了一下警钟：“你想想这个家是怎样来的？要不是志愿军给我们守住大门……”他们走后，我翻来覆去没有合上眼睛皮。天没亮，我就爬起床，“走，永远跟着共产党走！”我这样自言自语，我妻子还笑我发了疯。我没有答话，就向乡人民政府走，向上级表示决心革命到底。
    这时，我虽已有三分转变，但还不巩固。七月间上级调我到凤山乡工作，区里便有计划地派一个党员同志帮助我们学习中国共产党的历史。在学习讨论中，我前后左右想：我们的胜利是千百万革命先烈用生命换来的，要是大家像我这样松气，如刘胡兰同志等许多革命先烈的鲜血不是白流了吗？想到这里，我就坚定了革命的决心。同时，通过对比讨论，我更进一步找到了苦根，认识到过去受尽地主残酷的剥削情形：一家住在烂茅屋里，十二个姊妹中有七个因贫病死去，有五个给人家做童养媳、受苦。地主还勾结日寇和蒋匪帮把劳苦人民抓去做苦力、当兵。我越想越恨，越想越感到自己松气不对。因此我在国庆节上书毛主席，保证不松气，祖国需要我到那里，就到那里。
    但我开初转变时，我还只知道要“保家”，还看不清革命的远大前途。区委书记就介绍我看苏联“红十月集体农场”的画片，叫我到长沙市参观了许多工厂，还看了“锦绣河山”等影片，使我不仅到了长沙，还看到了祖国人民两年来的伟大建设和美丽的远景。当我第一次坐上工人老大哥制造出来的汽车，走进工厂，我心里更明亮了：工人兄弟是一天到晚和机器大生产在一起的，因此他们对革命事业坚决、勇敢、忠诚，毫无个人顾虑。这又使我联想起只有在共产党、工人阶级领导下，农民才能洗刷缺点，走向社会主义。于是我要求加入中国共产党。
    共产党教育了我，挽救了我，使我没有做一个只看见自己鼻子尖下一点利益的糊涂虫，而且初步树立了共产主义的人生观，成了一个光荣的共产党员。我自己走了一段弯路，感到痛心。所以我常常用现身说法，耐心地帮助想“歇劲”的农民兄弟醒过来。
    这一向，我在幸福乡工作，雇贫农生活有困难，我就逐家逐户摸底，帮助他们订生产度荒计划。当工作一碰到困难，我就想起了“共产党员前面是没有困难的”这句话，我就有了力量，有了依靠。我知道自己还改造得不够，工作中还有很多缺点，在党生日的前夕，我立下保证：要切实做到党员标准的八项条件，彻底改造我身上的农民思想残余和缺点，决心革命到底，任何时候，不动摇，不退缩，不怕流血牺牲，坚决忠诚执行党的决议，终身为共产主义事业奋斗。（新华社）
