Doing a Good Job in Cotton Supply
Chen Qixiang, Manager of China National Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Corporation

Last June, when cotton supply was difficult, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions to launch a nationwide cotton purchase and storage campaign. Thanks to the correct leadership and emphasis of the Party organizations and people's governments at all levels, and the high patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants, the campaign achieved the expected results. Although cotton mills once experienced shutdowns and reduced production, this was done in a planned and led manner, so the supply of cotton yarn and cloth in the fall still basically met the needs of the people. Over the past year, due to the high production enthusiasm of farmers and increased cotton production, coupled with vigorous purchases by state-owned trade and cooperative departments, the cotton supply situation this year, in terms of quantity, is much more abundant than last year. This year, cotton mills across the country not only do not need to shut down, but have already achieved full operation of six days and six nights per week. It is estimated that the cotton inventory before the autumn harvest of new cotton will increase by 126 percent compared to the same period last year.

However, this year's cotton supply work remains an arduous task.

First, as the state-owned trade sector's control of cotton increases, its cotton supply task has also greatly increased. Workers have raised their class consciousness in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm, and promoted advanced work methods, resulting in a universal increase in the production of cotton spinning mills. For example: Qingdao State-owned Factory's production of 20-count yarn per spindle in 20 hours increased from 1.18 pounds in January this year to 1.2 - 1.24 pounds in May, with some reaching a maximum of 1.3 pounds; Tianjin State-owned Factory's production of 20-count yarn per spindle in 20 hours increased from 1.152 pounds in January this year to 1.164 pounds in March; Shanghai State-owned Factory increased from 1.132 pounds to 1.134 pounds; the Northeast increased from 0.983 pounds to 1.021 pounds. This is a good phenomenon. The national cotton spinning industry's cotton yarn production in 1952 will increase by 38.43 percent compared to 1951. In the four months from June to September before the new cotton comes on the market, the situation is completely different from the shutdowns and reduced production in the same period last year. This year, cotton mills are both increasing production and maintaining full operation, so the supply and allocation of raw cotton remains very tight and arduous.

Second, in this year's (cotton year, i.e., September 1951 to August 1952) domestic cotton, the proportion of frost-damaged and yellowed cotton is higher than last year, while the length and grade of white cotton have been confused and lowered due to the lack of planning in procurement and allocation in the past. Therefore, although this year's cotton inventory is relatively large, some of it is not suitable for spinning.

Third, the average grade of the white cotton we currently control that is suitable for spinning has failed to meet the original blending standards, due to inflexible allocation in the past, coupled with the fact that some cotton mills consume more cotton of higher grades, while the grade of supplementary foreign cotton is poor. In terms of length, intermediate materials for medium-count yarns (the intermediate material for medium-count yarns is raw cotton with a length of 7/8 to 13/16 inches) are also in short supply, so we must change the blending composition in time to avoid supply and demand imbalances that affect production.

In order to maintain the normal full operation of cotton mills across the country, the following work must be done well:

One, Seize the opportunity to purchase cotton. In addition to completing the planned purchase tasks, all localities should strive to exceed the tasks, and especially purchase more white cotton. Cooperatives in various localities currently have many tasks, but because the task of cotton supply is still very heavy, we cannot relax timely purchases. According to reports from various localities, based on last year's experience, cotton farmers have a psychology of waiting for prices to rise and being reluctant to sell, and of retaining cotton to sell as patriotic cotton. Therefore, we must conduct political education for cotton farmers, explaining that the cotton supply and demand situation this year is different from last year. Due to the implementation of the central government's cotton-grain price ratio policy and cotton price plan, cotton prices have remained normal and stable, and cotton farmers' interests in cotton planting have been fully guaranteed. As for large-scale sales and storage campaigns, there is no need to hold them this year. We must make it clear to the cotton farmers who still have cotton that they should sell the cotton to the state in a timely manner to support the production of cotton mills.

Two, Reduce the inventory of trade turnover cotton and cotton mill turnover cotton in cotton-producing areas. Last year, we put forward the requirements of quick collection, quick ginning, quick packaging, and quick transportation, and that cotton mills in producing areas should store no more than one month's worth of cotton. Various localities transferred as much cotton as possible to support Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. By the end of August, the national trade turnover cotton was also compressed to the minimum limit, which helped solve the difficulty of raw cotton supply. This year, we still hope that all localities will continue to work hard to do this work better than last year, in order to overcome the difficulty of raw cotton allocation.

Three, Appropriately adjust the use of raw cotton. The National Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Corporation and cotton mills across the country should jointly solve this problem. Because the average grade of cotton we control is not high, and the raw materials of intermediate length for medium-count yarns are not abundant, it is recommended that cotton mills in various localities temporarily overcome difficulties, adjust the blending length and grade according to the raw cotton that can be supplied at present, and change the current imbalance in length and grade in blending. On the premise of not affecting the quality of finished products, appropriately blend in frost-damaged and yellowed cotton to reduce the consumption of white cotton.

Four, Flexibly allocate and apply according to the variety of raw cotton. In the past, the Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Corporation only focused on whether the quantity of raw cotton allocation was sufficient, and did not pay enough attention to the length and grade of raw cotton. Although a set of systems has been established successively in the past few years, due to the generally low technical level of purchasing units and untimely reporting of forms, planned allocation has not been achieved, which is obviously a big shortcoming and should be overcome in the future. Especially under the current situation of relatively heavy raw cotton supply, it is necessary to flexibly allocate and apply according to the varieties we control, so that all the current cotton raw materials can play their highest efficiency.

On the other hand, we must do a good job in the supply of cotton wadding this year. At present, there is a large inventory of coarse lint and yellow cotton. Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Corporations in various localities must prepare in advance before the wadding season, allocate and process cotton wadding in advance, and supply cotton wadding in a planned manner. There must be a reasonable price for cotton wadding to ensure a sufficient supply and eliminate the black market. Regarding the standards for cotton fluffing wages and loss, the regulations in various localities were relatively chaotic last year, which affected costs and increased the burden on the masses. Relevant departments in various localities should conduct thorough investigation and research this year to grasp them correctly.

### 做好棉花供应工作

    做好棉花供应工作
    中国花纱布公司经理  陈其襄
    去年六月，在棉花供应困难的时候，中央人民政府政务院曾发布指示，发动全国规模的购棉储棉运动。由于各地党的组织、人民政府的正确领导和重视，农民爱国热情的高涨，运动获得了预期的效果。当时纱厂虽曾一度停工减产，但这是有计划、有领导地进行的，因而秋后的纱布供应，依然基本上满足了人民需要。一年以来，由于农民生产情绪高涨，棉花产量提高，再加上国营贸易与合作部门的大力收购，今年棉花供应情况，从数量上看，已比去年充裕得多。今年全国纱厂不但不需要停工，而且已经达到每周开全工六天六夜。估计到秋季新棉收获前的棉花存量，要比去年同时期增加百分之一百二十六。
    但是，今年的棉花供应工作仍然是一个繁重的任务。
    首先，随着国营贸易部门掌握棉花数量的增加，其供棉任务也大大增加了。工人群众在“三反”“五反”运动中提高了阶级觉悟，发挥了高度的生产积极性，推广了先进工作法，棉纺厂生产量普遍提高了。如：青岛国营厂纺二十支纱，每锭二十小时的产量，今年一月份为一·一八磅，五月份即增至一·二——一·二四磅，最高有达一·三磅的；天津国营厂纺二十支纱，每锭二十小时的产量，由今年一月份的一·一五二磅增至三月份的一·一六四磅；上海国营厂由一·一三二磅增至一·一三四磅；东北由○·九八三磅增至一·○二一磅。这是好的现象。一九五二年全国棉纺业棉纱产量，将比一九五
    一年增加百分之三八·四三。在新棉上市以前的六至九月的四个月中，和去年同期停工减产情况完全不同。今年纱厂既增产，又要保持开全工，因此，在原棉供应、调度上，仍然是非常紧张而繁重的。
    第二，本年度（棉花年度，即一九五一年九月至一九五二年八月）的国产棉花，霜黄花所占比重较去年为多，而白花的长度、品级，则因过去在收购、调度等方面计划性很差，有混乱和降低的现象。因此今年棉花存量虽然比较多，但其中有一部分不适于纺用。
    第三，目前我们所掌握的可供纺织的白花，由于过去调拨不够灵活，加上若干纱厂耗用品级较高的棉花较多，而补充的外棉品级又差，因此，棉花的平均品级，已经不能达到原来的混棉标准。在长度方面，中支纱（指十五支至二十三支纱）的中间原料（中支纱的中间原料即长度八分之七、十六分之十三的原棉）亦感缺少，因此必须及时改变混棉成分，才不致使供需失调而影响生产。
    为了保持全国纱厂能照常开全工，必须做好以下工作：一、抓紧收购棉花。各地除应按计划数量完成收购任务外，还要争取超过任务，特别应该多收白花。各地合作社目前任务很多，但因棉花供应任务仍很繁重，因此不能放松及时收购。近据各地反映：棉农根据去年经验，有看涨惜售心理和留存棉花待售爱国棉的情况，因此必须向棉农进行政治教育，说明今年棉花供需情形和去年不同，由于贯彻执行了中央规定的棉粮比价政策和棉价方案，棉价一直保持正常和稳定，棉农的植棉利益已得到充分保证。至于大规模的售、储棉运动，今年已不需举行。要对目前还存有棉花的棉农讲清楚，应该把棉花及时卖给国家，支持纱厂生产。
    二、减少贸易周转棉及产棉区纱厂周转棉的存量。去年我们提出快收、快轧、快包、快运，产区纱厂至多存棉一个月用量的要求下，各地曾把存棉尽量调出，支援上海、天津、青岛等地，八月底全国贸易周转棉也压缩到最低限度，帮助解决了原棉供应的困难。今年仍希望各地继续努力，要把这一工作做得比去年更好，以克服原棉调配的困难。
    三、适当地调节使用原棉。国营花纱布公司和全国纱厂要共同解决这个问题。由于掌握的棉花平均品级不高，中支纱中间长度的原料又不充裕，因此建议各地纱厂，暂时根据目前所能供应的原棉情况，克服困难，调整混棉长度、品级，改变目前混棉中长度和等级方面的不平衡情况。在不影响成品品质的条件下，适当配搭霜黄花成分，以减少白花的消耗量。
    四、根据原棉的品种，灵活调拨应用。过去花纱布公司对于原棉调拨，只偏重于数量能否敷用，对于原棉的长度、品级注意则不够。虽然在几年来的工作中曾陆续建立了一套制度，但因收购单位一般技术水平不高，表单填报不及时，因而还没有做到有计划的进行调拨，这显然是很大的缺点，今后应该加以克服。尤其在目前原棉供应比较繁重的情况下，更须根据我们所掌握的品种，灵活调拨应用，使目前所有的棉花原料发挥其最高的效能。
    另一方面，要做好今年絮棉的供应工作。目前粗绒、黄花存量较大，各地花纱布公司必须在絮棉季节未到以前，先作准备，提早调拨、加工，有计划地供应絮棉。要有合理的絮棉牌价，做到充分供应，杜绝黑市。关于弹花工资及亏耗标准，去年各地规定比较混乱，影响成本，增加群众负担，今年各地有关部门应好好调查研究，正确掌握。
