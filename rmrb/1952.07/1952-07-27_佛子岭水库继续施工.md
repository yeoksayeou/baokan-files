Foziling Reservoir Construction Continues

More than 10,000 workers are persevering under the scorching sun to build the giant Foziling Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Pi River (a tributary on the south bank of the Huai River, entering the Huai River at Zhengyangguan). Of all the Huai River harnessing projects in the second year, this is the only one that continues non-stop even in the sweltering summer.

Many engineers and technical staff from various Huai River harnessing sites, as well as many skilled technicians, are concentrated on the Foziling Reservoir construction site. They are working and learning at the same time. More than 5,000 laborers and a People's Liberation Army unit are also participating in the construction of the reservoir. The Foziling Reservoir project began this spring, when construction started while exploration and design were still underway. Now, the work of exploration, charting, and design has been completed. The protective cofferdam for the construction site is also nearing completion. The main project currently under construction is a 453-meter-long hollow dam between two mountains.

The dam being built connects the two mountains and blocks the Pi River, which, once completed, will hold floodwaters in the mountain valley reservoir. The dam is designed as a continuous arch hollow dam. Both ends of the dam will be made entirely of concrete, with continuous arches made of steel bars in the middle, and then poured with concrete. Currently, the grout at the eastern end of the dam foundation has been poured, and concrete is being poured for the dam body.

The deep mountain valley of Foziling in Huoshan has now become a large-scale, busy, and bustling construction site. (Xinhua News Agency)

    佛子岭水库继续施工
    一万多员工在烈日下坚持修筑淠河（淮河南岸的一条支流，在正阳关入淮）上游的佛子岭巨型水库。第二年度治淮的一切工程，只有这一个工程在酷热的暑天也不停工。
    修佛子岭水库的工地上，集中了来自治淮各个工地的许多工程师和技术工作人员，以及许多熟练的技术工人。他们一面劳动，一面学习。五千多民工和一支人民解放军部队，也参加了修水库的劳动。修佛子岭水库工程是今年春天开工的，那时候一面还在钻探、设计，一面就已经动手施工了。到现在，钻探、作图表、设计等等工作都已经完成了。保护工地的围埝也快筑好了。现在正在兴修的主要工程，是两山之间的设计中的一条长四百五十三公尺空心拦河坝。
    正在修的拦河坝，连接两山拦住淠河，修成后就可把洪水拦在山谷水库里。坝身设计是连拱式的空心坝，坝的两端将全由混凝土凝成，中间由钢筋扎成连拱式，然后浇灌混凝土。现在，坝基东端已灌好的水泥浆，正在浇灌坝身的混凝土。
    霍山佛子岭的深山僻谷，现在成了一座规模巨大的紧张而热闹的工场。（据新华社讯）
