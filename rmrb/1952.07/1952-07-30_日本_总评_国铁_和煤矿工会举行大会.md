Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 28th: According to TASS, the Third Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with approximately three million members, was held in Tokyo from July 22nd to 24th. At the congress, the left wing, representing the electrical, chemical, coal mining, and other unions, fought with the right wing, which controlled the maritime, textile, and mining workers' unions.

    The congress passed a draft action program proposed by the Sohyo leadership. The draft program pointed out the need to combat the dangerous actions of the ruling clique surrounding the American monopolists in provoking war, oppose the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty," oppose rearmament and the granting of military bases in Japan to the Americans, strive for national independence and independent foreign trade—including trade with the People's Republic of China, oppose repressive legislation and the capitalists' attacks on the rights of the working people, and strive for the establishment of a minimum essential wage.

    However, the draft program also reflected the hesitations of the Sohyo leadership, neglected many important demands of the Japanese working class such as equal pay for equal work, and bowed to the policies and slogans of the Japanese reactionaries.

    The issue of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan joining the splittist "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" sparked fierce struggle, with the right wing of the General Council insisting on joining.

    But this proposal was rejected; out of two hundred and twenty-one votes, only forty-two votes were in favor. The congress decided to submit the issue of joining the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" to the unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions for discussion.

    In the election of the Sohyo leadership, the left wing won. Susumu Fujita, representing the National Electrical Industry Workers' Union, was elected as Chairman, and Kaoru Ota, representing the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union, Akira Imamura (previously mistranslated as Akira Imamura), representing the Japan Teachers' Union, and Yoshitaka Morotomi (previously mistranslated as Yoshitaka Morotomi), representing the National Coal Miners' Union, were elected as Vice-Chairmen. Minoru Takano was re-elected as Secretary-General.

    Prior to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan holding its congress, two large unions—the National Railway Workers' Union, with approximately 400,000 members, and the National Coal Miners' Union, with approximately 270,000 members—held congresses.

    At the recent 11th Congress of the National Railway Workers' Union, the union's former leadership was sharply criticized for making concessions to the government in two struggles by workers to improve their living conditions. The congress decided to fight against rearmament, to strive for trade with the People's Republic of China, and to work towards the abolition of the reactionary "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." In the election of the leadership, the left wing won. Koichi Domon (transliteration) and Aizawa were elected as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the union's Central Executive Committee, respectively.

    The National Coal Miners' Union recently held its Sixth Extraordinary Congress in Kinugawa, where a heated debate took place regarding the results of the recent struggle against repressive legislation. The union's leadership suffered sharp criticism. The congress approved demands for increasing miners' wages. According to the newspaper "Laborer," the representatives attending the congress signed appeals demanding the immediate conclusion of a Korean armistice agreement, opposing germ warfare, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and opposing conscription. AFL representative De Fleur, who attended the congress as an observer, also had to sign the appeal, because he feared his reputation would be completely lost.

    The leftward turn of the Japanese labor movement, and the decline of the influence of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" in Japan, greatly disturbed the leaders of the American unions. On the eve of these two large unions holding national congresses, ICFTU representative and CIO Executive Committee member Townsend, and AFL representative De Fleur, were hastily sent to Japan. They did not conceal their intentions. "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out that De Fleur issued a statement emphasizing that he came to Japan to organize "anti-communist forces" in Asia, and emphasized that Japanese unions must become the center of these forces. "Mainichi Shimbun" also said: "Townsend brought seven hundred thousand dollars with him to fund the activities of splitters in the Japanese labor movement."

    The arrival of these splitters aroused widespread indignation in Japanese unions. "Laborer" published a letter to workers, calling on them to drive these American agents out of Japan.

    "Laborer" also reported that the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations issued a statement regarding the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointing out that there was a possibility of establishing a united labor front through the General Council, as long as a group of traitors headed by Yo Hoshika and Takeo Muto, the heads of the so-called Patriotic Labor Movement Council, and a group representing the so-called "New Sanbetsu" (i.e., the National Federation of Industrial Organizations) were expelled.

    The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations proposed the following action plan:

    (1) Fight against low wages, strive for the establishment of a minimum essential wage, and implement equal pay for equal work.

    (2) Diplomatic independence, economic independence, trade with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and unlimited development of peaceful industries and free enterprise.

    (3) Fight against repressive legislation, strive for freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, strike, demonstration, religious belief, and the abolition of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law."

    (4) Defend the peaceful constitution, oppose rearmament, end the occupation, immediately withdraw the occupying forces, conclude a comprehensive peace treaty, abolish the separate peace treaty and the "Administrative Agreement," oppose the establishment of military bases in Japan by the United States, oppose the manufacture and transportation of war materials, strive for peace in Korea, and immediately withdraw the invading forces in Korea.

    (5) Strive for the unity of trade unions and strengthen the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

    (6) Withdraw from the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," join the People's World Federation of Trade Unions, and participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    (7) Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and establish a government of national liberation united front.

### 日本“总评”“国铁”和煤矿工会举行大会

    日本“总评”“国铁”和煤矿工会举行大会
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社东京二十八日讯：拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会所属工会第三届代表大会，已于七月二十二日至二十四日在东京举行。在大会上，代表电气、化学、煤矿和其他工会的左翼，与控制了海员、纺织和矿业工人工会的右翼进行了斗争。
    大会通过了工会总评议会领导机关所提出的行动纲领草案。该纲领草案指出，必须对围绕在美国垄断资本家周围的统治集团的挑拨战争的行动的危险进行斗争，反对单独和约与“安全条约”，反对重新武装和把日本的军事基地让给美国人，争取民族独立和独立的对外贸易——包括对中华人民共和国的贸易，反对镇压性的立法以及资本家对劳动人民权利的进攻，争取确定最低限度的必需工资。
    但纲领草案也反映了总评议会领导机关的犹豫态度，并且忽视了日本工人阶级的同工同酬等许多重要要求，同时却对日本反动派的政策与口号低头。
    日本工会总评议会加入分裂分子的“国际自由工会联合会”的问题，引起了激烈的斗争，工会总评议会的右翼坚持加入。
    但这种建议被否决了，在二百二十一票中，仅有四十二票赞成。大会决定把加入“国际自由工会联合会”的问题交给工会总评议会所属各工会讨论。
    在总评议会领导机关的选举中，左翼获胜。代表全国电气产业工会的藤田进当选为主席，代表合成化学产业工会的太田薰、代表日本教职员工会的今村彰（前误译为今村明）和代表全国煤矿工会的诸富义高（前误译为诸富吉隆）当选为副主席。高野实重新当选为事务局局长。
    在日本工会总评议会举行代表大会以前，两个大工会——拥有会员约四十万人的国营铁道工会和拥有会员约二十七万人的全国煤矿工会——举行了代表大会。
    在国营铁道工会最近举行的第十一届代表大会中，该工会的前领导机关受到尖锐的批评，因为他们在工人争取改善生活条件的两次斗争中向政府作了让步。代表大会决定为反对重新武装、争取与中华人民共和国贸易、为争取废除反动的“防止破坏活动法”而斗争。领导机关的选举中，左翼获胜。土门康一（译音）和相泽分别当选为该工会的中央执行委员会的正副主席。
    全国煤矿工会最近在鬼怒川举行了第六届非常代表大会，大会就最近反对镇压性立法的斗争的结果进行了热烈的辩论。该工会的领导机关遭受了尖锐的批评。代表大会批准关于提高矿工工资的要求。据报纸“劳动者”说，参加代表大会的代表们在要求立即缔结朝鲜停战协定、反对细菌战、反对日本重新武装和反对征兵的呼吁书上签了名。列席代表大会的美国劳联代表地佛拉尔也不得不在呼吁书上签名，因为他害怕他的声誉会完全丧失。
    日本劳工运动的左倾，以及“国际自由工会联合会”在日本的影响的衰减，使美国工会的领袖大为不安。在这两个大工会举行全国代表大会的前夕，“国际自由工会联合会”代表、美国产联执行委员会委员唐森及劳联代表地佛拉尔被仓卒地派到日本来。他们并没有隐瞒他们的意图。“每日新闻”指出，地佛拉尔发表声明，强调他来日本是为了组织亚洲的“反共力量”，并强调日本工会必须成为这些力量的中心。“每日新闻”还说：“唐森随身带了七十万美元，作为分裂分子在日本工会运动中的活动费。”
    这些分裂分子的到来，引起了日本工会普遍的愤慨。“劳动者”刊载了一篇致工人书，号召他们把这些美国代理人赶出日本。
    “劳动者”还报道，全日本产业别工会会议就日本工会总评议会的事发表声明，指出有通过总评议会建立劳工统一阵线的可能性，只要把以星加要和武藤武雄为首的一批卖国贼、所谓爱国劳工运动协议会的头目和代表所谓“新产别”（按即全国产业别工会联合会）的一帮人驱逐出去就成。
    全日本产业别工会会议建议下列行动方案：
    （一）为反对低工资、争取确定最低限度工资和实行同工同酬而斗争。
    （二）外交独立，经济独立，跟中华人民共和国与苏联进行贸易，无限制发展和平工业与企业自由。
    （三）为反对镇压性的立法，争取言论、出版、集会、结社、罢工、示威、宗教信仰的自由和废除
    “防止破坏活动法”而斗争。
    （四）保卫和平宪法，反对重整军备，结束占领状态，立即撤退占领部队，缔结全面和约，废除单独和约和“行政协定”，反对美国在日本建立军事基地，反对制造和运输战争物资，争取朝鲜和平，立即撤退在朝鲜的侵略军。
    （五）争取工会的团结，加强日本工会总评议会。
    （六）退出“国际自由工会联合会”，参加人民的世界工会联合会，参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    （七）打倒吉田内阁，解散国会，建立民族解放统一战线的政府。
