    Many Readers' Letters Point Out That Medical Personnel Should Undergo Ideological Remolding

    After this newspaper published a short commentary on June 18th entitled "All Medical and Health Workers Must Undergo Ideological Remolding," many readers wrote in, agreeing with this newspaper's opinion, and believing that it is absolutely necessary to launch an ideological remolding movement among medical workers.

    Readers expressed extreme indignation at the irresponsible and life-disregarding behavior of some medical personnel. Reader Zhang Yiren wrote in his letter: "In the new China, the people are the most valuable asset of the country. The People's Government has done a lot of work to protect the people's health. However, medical personnel are actually disregarding human life and refusing to save patients in distress, which is intolerable to the broad masses of people." Reader Ye Lu wrote in her letter: "The sinful attitude of some medical workers in refusing to save patients in distress, compared with the noble qualities of martyr Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save a Korean boy, makes people feel how strong the contrast between good and evil is! The sinful attitude of these medical personnel is really infuriating."

    Reader Wen Yuqi wrote in his letter: "Some medical personnel often attribute the causes of medical accidents to objective reasons such as 'busy work' and 'too few people', instead of seriously examining their own ideological style. In this way, it is impossible to improve medical work." Readers Bai Rong, Hu Junqing, and Wang Yixiang all pointed out in their letters: "If medical personnel want to do a good job, they must first solve the problem of whom to serve." "Some medical personnel only say that they want to serve the people in words, but their minds are filled with the idea of 'serving' the Renminbi (people's currency). How can they do a good job!" Reader Jin Jianying pointed out: "Some doctors think that they have skills and can get along well everywhere, so there is no need for ideological remolding. In fact, what is the use of having skills if you don't serve the people? What the people need are medical personnel with revolutionary humanitarianism who can wholeheartedly serve the people, and not those medical personnel who treat people's lives as child's play."

    Reader Li Kuichang reported: "The criticisms in the People's Daily have already caused repercussions in some medical departments. The Beijing Municipal Third Hospital posted the summary of readers' letters criticizing the irresponsible work style of medical workers in the People's Daily on the wall newspaper with red headlines. But on the whole, medical personnel still do not pay enough attention to the issue of ideological remolding." Therefore, readers Shi Dekui, Li Jian, Liu Changming, Duan Jinsheng, Zhang Shishun, Liang Hua, Yang Jingming, Han Yingmin, etc. unanimously suggested that the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, lead the national medical personnel to carry out an ideological remolding movement on a large scale, so that they can criticize bourgeois ideology and establish the viewpoint of serving the people. All readers are deeply convinced that only through the ideological remolding movement can medical workers better shoulder the responsibility of "healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and promoting revolutionary humanitarianism," and adapt to the needs of the people in the great construction of the motherland.

### 很多读者来信指出  医务人员应该进行思想改造

专栏：读者来信综述

    很多读者来信指出
    医务人员应该进行思想改造
    六月十八日本栏发表了题为“一切医药卫生工作者必须进行思想改造”的简评以后，很多读者来信，同意本报的意见，认为在医务工作者中开展
    一个思想改造运动是十分必要的。
    读者对某些医务人员不负责任、草菅人命的行为，表示极度愤慨。读者张义人来信说：“在新中国，人民是国家最宝贵的财产。人民政府在保护人民健康方面做了很多工作。但是，医务人员竟草菅人命、对病人见死不救，这是广大人民所不能容忍的。”读者叶露来信说：“某些医务工作者对病人见死不救的罪恶态度，和罗盛教烈士舍身抢救朝鲜少年的高贵品质相比较，使人感到这是多么强烈的善与恶的对比！这些医务人员的罪恶态度实在令人愤慨。”
    读者闻玉麒来信说：“某些医务人员常常把发生医疗事故的原因推到‘工作忙’、‘人少’等客观原因上，而不认真地从自己的思想作风方面进行检查，这就不可能改进医疗工作。”读者白荣、胡俊清、王益祥都在来信中指出：“医务人员要做好工作，首先必须解决为谁服务的问题。”“某些医务人员只是在口头上说要为人民服务，而在脑袋里却充满着为人民币‘服务’的思想，这怎么能做好工作呢！”读者金剑英指出：“有的大夫认为自己有技术，到处吃得开，用不着进行思想改造。其实，有技术不为人民服务又有什么用呢？人民需要的是有着革命人道主义、能全心全意为人民服务的医务人员，而不需要那些把人民生命当儿戏的医务人员。”
    读者李奎昌反映：“人民日报的批评已经在某些医务部门引起了反响。北京市立第三医院把人民日报批评医务工作者不负责任的作风的读者来信综述，加上红字标题，贴在墙报上。但整个说来，医务人员对思想改造问题的重视还是不够的。”因此，读者史德奎、李健、刘长命、段金生、张时顺、梁化、杨景明、韩应民等一致建议中央人民政府卫生部在
    “三反”运动的胜利基础上，领导全国医务人员，大张旗鼓地进行一次思想改造运动，使他们批判资产阶级思想，树立为人民服务的观点。所有读者都深信，只有经过思想改造运动，医务工作者才能很好地担负起“救死扶伤，发扬革命人道主义”的责任，才能在祖国伟大建设中适应人民的需要。
