In order to train a large number of minority cadres, the Guangxi Branch of the Central Institute for Nationalities was established in March this year. The Provincial People's Government and relevant special districts and counties have successively opened training classes for minority nationalities, absorbing a large number of minority youths to participate in learning.

Qiu Huizuo, director of the Political Department of the South China Military Region, made a summary report on the cultural education work in the past six months. He pointed out that the main experiences in doing a good job in cultural education are: leaders at all levels must have a strong determination, be good at grasping the key points of education, conscientiously train cultural instructors, and give play to the learning enthusiasm of all commanders and fighters.
