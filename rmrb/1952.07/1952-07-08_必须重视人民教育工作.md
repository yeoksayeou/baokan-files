    We Must Emphasize the People's Education Work
    Comrade Editor: My child, Xiaojuan, is about to graduate from senior primary school. Once, I asked her and her three classmates what they planned to do after graduation, and they all said in unison: they wanted to enter middle school and become military strategists, writers, and engineers in the future! None of them wanted to apply for normal school because, "The teacher said that normal school students are the most useless, and at most they can only become teachers!"

    I think this view of looking down on people's teachers is very wrong. Kalinin said: "Please think about it. The state and the people entrust children to teachers, asking them to educate these people who are most easily influenced in terms of age... This is a great responsibility placed on teachers." (See "On Communist Education") The work of people's teachers is such an important work. Today, when the motherland urgently needs construction talents in all aspects, I believe that the responsibility of educators is especially glorious and important! Therefore, we should thoroughly correct this unhealthy trend of despising education work left over from the old society; especially those who are currently working as people's teachers, they should study harder, love their careers, and be determined to fight for the people's education cause to the end!

    必须重视人民教育工作
    编辑同志：我的孩子小娟快要从高小毕业了。有一次，我问她和她的三个同学，毕业以后预备做些什么，她们都异口同声地说：想入中学，将来做个军事家，文学家，工程师！她们没有一个人愿意考师范学校，原因是：“老师讲啦，师范生顶没出息，最多当个教书匠！”
    这种轻视人民教师的看法，我认为是很不对的。加里宁说：“请大家想想吧。国家和人民把儿童信托给教师们，要他们来教育这些按年龄上是最容易受影响的人……，这乃是把伟大责任加在教师们身上的一种重托。”（见“论共产主义教育”）人民教师的工作就是这样重要的工作。当祖国各方面迫切需要建设人才的今天，我认为教育工作者的责任是尤其光荣和重要！因之，我们应该彻底纠正旧社会遗留下来的这种轻视教育工作的歪风；特别是正在作人民教师工作的人，他们更应该努力学习，热爱自己的事业，并抱定决心，为人民的教育事业奋斗到底！    丁鹏举
