    Changes in Rural Areas Around the Great Gobi Desert
    Li Ruyi

    A Prosperous Agricultural Region

    In the Tarim Basin of southern Xinjiang, countless fertile oases surround the Great Gobi Desert. The Tarim Basin is located south of the Tianshan Mountains, and people commonly refer to it as "Southern Xinjiang." For thousands of years, hardworking and courageous Uyghur farmers have settled here. They have overcome the invasion of wind, sand, and other natural disasters, and conquered the difficulties of agricultural water use, expanding the oases towards the Gobi. Currently, it has become a vast agricultural area with an agricultural population of more than 2.7 million and over 12 million mu of fertile land.

    The climate in Southern Xinjiang is basically continental, but there are no extremes of heat or cold in the oases. Eight months out of the year are suitable for crop growth. Wheat, cotton, corn, and rice are the main crops in Southern Xinjiang. Other crops such as beans, sesame, millet, flax, alfalfa, barley, potatoes, sunflowers, hemp seeds, radishes, and various fruits and vegetables are also commonly grown in rural areas. The abundance and quality of the fruits are superior to those in ordinary inland rural areas.

    The Great Gobi area has always lacked rainfall, and crops must be artificially irrigated. After liberation, the water conservancy system was reformed, and the canals were initially repaired and expanded. The water volume in Southern Xinjiang is now sufficient to supply the needs of the existing cultivated land. If water conservancy facilities and management systems are further improved, the cultivated area can be greatly expanded. Major rivers in the oases of Southern Xinjiang, such as the Aksu River, Kashgar River, Yarkand River, and Yurungkash River, lose a large amount of water to the Gobi Desert every year; if the main stream of the Tarim River, which runs through the Great Gobi, could be utilized, it would greatly change the face of the Gobi. In addition, many springs have not been discovered and utilized. Water for agricultural production in Southern Xinjiang is very abundant. The climate here is dry, making it difficult for pests to breed, so pest damage is less than in other regions. Strong winds are more frequent in the spring and summer, but crop damage is not common. The only common disaster is wild boars trampling crops near the Gobi. After liberation, due to the frequent assistance of the People's Liberation Army in hunting, the harm caused by wild boars has also been reduced day by day.

    Southern Xinjiang possesses all the conditions necessary for an agricultural area: a suitable climate, fertile soil, abundant water, and a wide variety of agricultural products. Of course, the decisive condition is that the farmers here are hardworking, intelligent, and courageous. However, in the old society, during the years of reactionary rule, on this rich land, the masses of farmers were extremely poor, production technology was extremely backward, and the natural and social potential was suppressed under the big stone of feudalism.

    The Root of Poverty and Backwardness

    Before liberation, the exploitation and oppression of peasants by the landlord class in Southern Xinjiang was extremely cruel. Farmers labored all year round, but could not maintain even the minimum standard of living. More than 60 percent, or even 100 percent, of their labor products were plundered by the landlord class. Corresponding to this barbarous and backward feudal production relationship were extremely crude production tools and extremely primitive farming methods: iron agricultural tools accounted for a very small proportion of all agricultural tools; from sowing to harvesting, cultivation was very extensive. The yield per unit area was very low, and land rent and reactionary government taxes were very heavy, which made it impossible for farmers to expand reproduction, and even simple reproduction was difficult. The level of agricultural production remained perpetually at a low, primitive stage.

    The low level of rural productivity can be seen from the following statistics.

    Before liberation, the general situation of farmers in Southern Xinjiang owning draught animals and farm implements was: one cow for every 4.4 households or 4.6 laborers; one donkey for every 1.6 households or 2.1 laborers; one plow for every 6.8 households or 7.8 laborers; one hoe (for digging) and sickle for every 1.8 households or 2.1 laborers. Hoes and sickles were particularly scarce, with more than half of the labor force lacking these two basic farm implements. That is to say, at that time, more than half of the rural labor force was often unable to engage in agricultural production. At that time, farmers' income from farming, after paying rent, taxes, and their own living expenses, did not allow them to invest in production. Before liberation, the life of farmers in Southern Xinjiang was extremely poor.

    Preliminary Liberation of Productive Forces

    After the liberation of Xinjiang, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government carried out a series of social reforms in Xinjiang, which gradually liberated agricultural productive forces in the rural areas of Southern Xinjiang.

    Over the past three years, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have led the farmers of Xinjiang to transform village and township governments, implement reasonable burdens, reform the feudal-controlled water conservancy system, implement a democratically managed water conservancy system, adjust the lease relations of public land, and carry out mass social reform movements such as rent reduction and anti-hegemony, which have preliminarily liberated agricultural productive forces.

    Farmers in Southern Xinjiang have universally and substantially increased the number of draught animals and farm implements. In 1951, the number of cattle owned by farmers in Southern Xinjiang increased by 20 percent compared with 1949; donkeys increased by more than 35 percent; plows increased by 37 percent; and hoes and sickles increased by 27 percent. Farming methods are also constantly improving. Due to the vigorous call and promotion of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the use of advanced and scientific farming methods by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang in agricultural production, the Uyghur farmers, who have always been accustomed to rough management, have now begun to cultivate intensively and meticulously. In the past, farmers rarely applied fertilizer, but now they apply more fertilizer; in the past, farmers rarely weeded and loosened the soil, but now they also weed and loosen the soil more often. Other practices such as seed selection and pest control have also begun to be implemented. These improvements in farming methods have played a significant role in promoting agricultural development and increasing yields per unit area.

    Due to these reasons, by 1952, the yield per unit area in the rural areas of Southern Xinjiang had increased by an average of 25 to 30 percent compared with before liberation. At the beginning of the spring plowing in 1952, farmers in various places universally formulated patriotic production increase plans, expecting the average yield per unit area to increase by another 15 to 20 percent compared with 1951.

    Since liberation, the farmers of Southern Xinjiang have gradually moved from a state of hunger to a state of abundance. It is particularly worth pointing out that while appropriately improving their own lives, farmers can also invest heavily in production, and their expenditures on means of production far exceed their living expenses. This is a clear sign of the rapid rise of agricultural productive forces in rural Southern Xinjiang and the best proof that productive forces have been liberated. They will further fight against the Great Gobi Desert, continuously expand the oases, and conquer the desert with human power.

    大戈壁周围农村的变化
    李如一
    富庶的农业地区
    在新疆南部的塔里木盆地，有无数肥美的绿洲环绕在大戈壁的周围。塔里木盆地位于天山以南，人们习惯上称这里为“南疆”。千百年来，勤劳勇敢的维吾尔族农民，一直定居在这里。他们战胜了风沙和其他自然灾害的侵袭，克服了农业用水的困难，把绿洲向戈壁扩展。目前，这里已成为拥有农业人口二百七十多万、良田一千二百多万亩的广大农业区了。
    南疆的气候基本上是大陆性的，但绿洲中并没有暴冷暴热的现象。全年十二个月中，有八个月适宜于农作物的生长。麦、棉、玉米、稻子等作物，在南疆各地农产品中占有主要地位。其他如豆类、芝麻、小米、胡麻、苜蓿、大麦、洋芋、葵花、麻子、萝卜和各种瓜果菜类，各地农村也普遍种植。瓜果产量的富足，品质的优美，尤为内地一般农村所不及。
    大戈壁一带向来缺少雨水，农作物都要用人工灌溉。解放后，水利制度改革了，渠道初步整修和扩充了，南疆的水量已能充分供应现有耕地的需要。如果水利设备和管理制度再加改善，耕地面积还可以大加扩张。南疆各绿洲中的主要河流，如阿克苏河、喀什河、叶尔羌河、玉龙喀什河等，每年都有大量水流渗透在戈壁沙漠中而浪费了；如果能把奔驰在大戈壁中的塔里木河主流加以利用，将使戈壁面貌大为改变。此外，还有很多泉水未被发现和利用。南疆农业生产中的用水是非常充足的。这里气候干燥，害虫繁殖不易，虫害较其他地区为少。狂风在春夏之交较多，但摧残谷物的事，还是不常见的。唯一习见的灾害，就是野猪践踏靠近戈壁地带的庄稼。解放后，由于人民解放军经常协助农民捕杀，野猪的为害也一天天减轻了。
    南疆具备了一切农业区所必须具备的条件：气候适宜，土壤肥沃，水量充沛，农业产品种类繁多。当然，决定的条件是，这里的农民是勤劳、智慧、勇敢的。然而，在旧社会，在反动派统治的年月，在这块富庶的土地上，农民大众异常贫穷，生产技术极端落后，自然的和社会的潜力，都被压在封建的大石头下面了。
    贫穷落后的根源
    解放前，南疆的地主阶级对农民所进行的剥削和压迫，是无比惨重的。农民们终年劳动，却不能维持最低限度的生活水平。劳动生产品的百分之六十以上，甚至百分之百，都被地主阶级掠夺去了。和这种野蛮的、落后的封建生产关系相适应的，是极其简陋的生产工具和极其原始的耕作方法：铁制农具在全部农具中所占的比重极小；种子下地以后直到收割，耕作都很粗放。单位面积产量很低，而地租及反动政权的赋税很重，这样便使得农民失去一切扩大再生产的可能性，甚至单纯再生产也不容易。农业生产水平永远停滞在低落的、原始的阶段。
    农村生产力低下的情况可以从以下的统计中看出来。
    解放以前，南疆农民占有耕畜农具的一般情况是：每四点四家或每四点六个劳动力有一头牛；每
    一点六家或每二点一个劳动力有一头驴；每六点八家或每七点八个劳动力有一架犁；每一点八家或每二点一个劳动力有一把砍土镘（掘土工具）和镰刀。砍土镘和镰刀特别缺乏，有一半以上的劳动力缺乏这两种最基本的农具。这就是说，当时农村中经常有一半以上的劳动力无法投入农业生产中去。当时，农民种地的收入，除去缴纳地租、赋税和本身生活支出而外，就没有投资生产的能力了。在解放前，南疆农民的生活是极端贫困的。
    生产力的初步解放
    新疆解放以后，中国共产党和人民政府在新疆进行了一系列的社会改革工作，这样就逐步地解放了南疆农村的农业生产力。
    三年来，中国共产党和人民政府领导新疆农民，改造了村乡政权，实行了合理负担，改革了封建把持的水利制度，实行了民主管理的水利制度，调剂了公地的租佃关系，开展了减租反霸等群众性的社会改革运动，已使农业生产力初步得到了解放。
    南疆的农民，普遍而且大量地增添了耕畜和农具。一九五一年南疆农民所有的耕牛，比一九四九年增加了百分之二十；驴增加了百分之三十五强；犁增加了百分之三十七；砍土镘和镰刀增加百分之二十七。耕作方法也在不断地改进。由于共产党和人民政府的大力号召和推动，由于驻新疆人民解放军在农业生产中使用了先进的、科学的耕作方法，这就使得一向习惯于粗糙经营的维吾尔族农民，现在也开始精耕细作了。过去农民很少施肥，现在较多地施肥了；过去农民很少除草、松土，现在也较多地除草松土了。其他如选种、防治病虫害等，都已开始实行。这些耕作方法上的改进，对促进农业的发展和提高单位面积产量，起了很大的作用。
    由于这些原因，到一九五二年止，南疆农村的单位面积产量，平均比解放前增加了百分之二十五到三十。一九五二年春耕开始时，各地农民都普遍订立了爱国增产计划，预计平均单位面积产量将比一九五一年再增加百分之十五到二十。
    解放以后的南疆农民，已从饥饿状态逐渐进入丰衣足食的境地。特别值得指出的是：农民们在适当改善自己生活的同时，还能在生产上大量投资，他们的生产资料的支出远超过生活费用的支出。这是南疆农村的农业生产力急速上升的鲜明的标志，是生产力得到解放的最好的证明。他们将进一步和大戈壁作斗争，使绿洲不断扩展，用人力征服沙漠。
