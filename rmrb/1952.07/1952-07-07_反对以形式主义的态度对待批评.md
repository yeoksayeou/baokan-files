    Oppose Treating Criticism with Formalism
    *Pravda* Editorial
    At the end of last year, *Pravda* published a newsletter reporting the fact that the Tambov Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) treated criticism with a formalistic attitude. The newsletter specifically mentioned that letters criticizing the unsatisfactory situation in the work of the Pondar District Party were shelved in the provincial committee for a long time and then stored in the archives.
    Some time later, the Tambov Provincial Committee notified the *Pravda* editorial department that they had taken the necessary measures to eliminate the shortcomings when reviewing all letters and appeals sent to the provincial, municipal, or district committees.
    It seemed as if the criticism had worked, and the situation would fundamentally improve. However, just recently, the editorial department received a letter. The writer, Comrade Dibikin, a Party member and teacher at the Qishi Village Seven-Year School in the Pondar District of Tambov Province, wrote:
    "I read in *Pravda* the newsletter about our province's provincial committee treating letters from Party members with a formalistic attitude, and the news that they had taken measures to eliminate this shortcoming. Now I must state that the provincial committee's reply was merely a perfunctory formality. It has always been difficult for provincial committee staff to do anything to help our district committee improve the leadership of primary Party organizations. We have quite a few Party members here, but we rarely meet. Sometimes the Party does hold meetings, but only economic issues are raised for discussion at these rare meetings. Propaganda and mobilization work and Party education are glossed over. The district Party committee knows all this very well. The secretaries of the district committee, the heads of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations have been to our village more than once, but none of them has ever done anything to improve Party work, nor has any of them ever given a political report to the collective farmers. I know all the serious shortcomings that exist in Party work here and in the provincial committee. Signals in this regard are still pouring in from there. But the work of clarifying the situation is still pending. And this is what is called – the provincial committee ‘has taken the necessary measures to eliminate the shortcomings…!’”
    *Pravda* reporters conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the facts in the Pondar District and confirmed the correctness of the writer's criticism.
    What does this fact illustrate?
    First, it shows that the Tambov Provincial Committee treats criticism with a formalistic attitude, and that after acknowledging the correctness of the criticism, they did not take concrete measures to eliminate the shortcomings. There is no other way to explain the following fact: the Party work in the Pondar District is still in an unsatisfactory state, and the signals sent to the provincial committee in this regard are still unanswered and all fail to achieve their purpose.
    The Communist Party educates cadres and all the Soviet people to willingly practice Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Stalin taught that criticism and self-criticism are the laws of our development, and the decisive means to overcome all outdated thinking and moribund phenomena that hinder our victorious advance. The extensive development of criticism and self-criticism brilliantly embodies the democratic spirit of the Soviet system, and the high political consciousness of the Soviet people - the all-powerful masters of their own country and creators of a new life.
    The smooth completion of the tasks undertaken by the local Party organizations inevitably relies on the development of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, because Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism can help eliminate shortcomings and improve the Party's political and organizational work. In striving to improve the level of leadership in economic and cultural construction, our local Party organizations are widely applying criticism and self-criticism to their practical activities, carefully listening to the voices of the masses, listening to their correct criticisms and valuable suggestions, and implementing these suggestions.
    However, the fact of treating criticism with a formalistic attitude still exists today.
    Bolshevik criticism is principled and practical. It requires not simply confirming or acknowledging shortcomings, but exposing the causes of these shortcomings and taking the necessary measures to eliminate them. Workers who verbally acknowledge the correctness of criticism but do not actually take measures to eliminate this or that bad phenomenon are taking the wrong path. As a result, they practice misleading public opinion, giving the shortcomings that have been criticized the opportunity to grow. Simply acknowledging the correctness of criticism verbally, without confirming this acknowledgment with the struggle to eliminate shortcomings, is actually a disguised form of suppressing criticism. To treat criticism correctly, in a Bolshevik way, and not in a formalistic, bureaucratic way means not only acknowledging shortcomings, but also - and this is the main point - eliminating shortcomings in practice and not repeating them. Consistency between words and deeds, consistency between resolutions and implementation, is an outstanding characteristic of the Bolshevik leadership style.
    Every correct criticism, whether it comes from a meeting or from the newspaper, must be treated with extreme concern by the criticized organization and leaders, and concrete measures for correction must be taken. The Party teaches us that we must take an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings, promptly implement corrections, and never repeat them in the future. Comrade Stalin instructed: "The duty of Bolsheviks is not to conceal their mistakes, not to evade questions about their mistakes - as often happens with us; but to acknowledge their mistakes with sincerity and candor, to formulate ways to correct these mistakes with sincerity and candor, and to implement the correction of these mistakes with sincerity and candor."
    Any critical remark can only achieve its purpose and produce the greatest effect when the decision taken in connection with this criticism, like any other decision, is confirmed by concrete action, by a rationally organized check on the degree of implementation. What happens when this principle is deviated from can be seen clearly from the following fact:
    The Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee staff meeting severely criticized the shortcomings in the work of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, but the criticism was not given due attention, so the situation remained unchanged after the meeting. Only after a newsletter about the above and other shortcomings was published in the newspaper did the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee pass a resolution listing a series of measures to improve the work of the agency. However, the resolution was not confirmed by organizational work. This can be clearly seen from a letter received by *Pravda* a few days ago from Comrade Lazov, secretary of the Party's Petrozavodsk City Committee: There has been no significant improvement in the working methods of the central departments. They still pay little attention to the activities of the Party's municipal and district committees, still do not give them due assistance, and their work is limited to collecting various information and materials.
    The Bolshevik spirit of seeking truth from facts and the correct attitude towards criticism mean being good at carrying things through to the end and being good at systematically and realistically confirming the decisions that have been taken. A good resolution is only the beginning of things. To make it produce the desired effect, its implementation must be organized.
    Without concern for criticism and self-criticism, there can be no genuine concern for achievements in work. Criticism and self-criticism can not only quickly eliminate shortcomings and mistakes, but also prevent the danger of complacency and arrogance among workers. Comrade Stalin repeatedly warned that modesty, not arrogance, is the virtue of Bolsheviks; any leader, regardless of his position, is nothing more than a servant of the people. The Bolshevik leadership tradition is nothing other than the constant contact between leaders and the masses, the willingness to learn from the masses and the willingness to correct the shortcomings pointed out by the working people.
    To implement the slogan of criticism and self-criticism, it is necessary to overcome the formalistic attitude taken towards it, resolutely struggle against all those who hinder its development, protect all those who actively put forward healthy criticism from persecution, and ensure that correct critics feel that they are supported by the organized strength of the collective. The Party teaches that if a Bolshevik adheres to the truth, if his words and deeds conform to the ideals of the Party, to the calls of the Party, to the resolutions of the Party, to the instructions of the Party, then no one and nothing can push him off the right path.
    The task of local Party organizations is to use all means to develop criticism and self-criticism, and to educate our cadres and all Soviet people to wholeheartedly and strictly abide by the interests of the state, and to wholeheartedly take an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings and towards all backward and old things that hinder our progress.

    反对以形式主义的态度对待批评
    苏联真理报社论
    去年年底“真理报”发表过一篇通讯，报道关于联共（布）党唐波夫省委员会机关以形式主义的态度对待批评的事实。通讯里特别说到这一点：那些批评蓬达尔区党工作中不能令人满意的情况的来信，在省委会里边搁置了很长一个时间以后，又被存进档案库里去了。
    过了一些时候，唐波夫省委会通知“真理报”编辑部说，他们在审核所有寄给省委或是市委、区委的来信和申诉书时，已采取了消除缺点的必要办法。
    看起来，仿佛批评已起了作用，而情况也将根本好转似的；但就在不久以前，编辑部曾接到一封信。来信者——党员狄比金同志，唐波夫省蓬达尔区葛什村七年制学校的教师—写道：
    “当时我曾在‘真理报’上读过关于我省省委以形式主义的态度对待党员来信的那篇通讯，也读过关于他们已采取消除这种缺点的办法的那段消息。如今我必须声明，省委的答复只是为了形式上敷衍敷衍而已。省委工作人员一向就难得做些什么来帮助我们区委改进各初级党组织的领导工作。我们这里的党员是相当多的，然而我们就是极少碰头，有时党也开开会，但在这些仅有的会议上所提出讨论的，也仅仅是些经济上的问题。至于宣传鼓动工作以及党的教育方面，都被略而不谈。关于这一切，党区委都知道得很清楚。各位区委书记，党、工会及共青团组织部主任，他们来过我们村里何止一次，可就是没有一位曾经做些什么来改进党的工作，也没有一位曾经在集体农民们面前作过一次政治报告。在我们这里以及在省委方面的党工作中所存在的严重缺点，我全知道。关于这一方面的信号，目前仍向那边源源不绝而去。但澄清局面的工作，却至今犹付阙如。而这就叫做——省委‘已采取消除缺点的必要办法……’！”
    “真理报”访员就地检查过蓬达尔区的事实情况，证实了来信者批评意见的正确。
    这个事实说明什么呢？
    首先说明，唐波夫省委是以形式主义的态度对待批评的，说明他们在承认批评的正确之后，并没有接着采取具体的办法来消除缺点。舍此，就没有话可以解释下面的事实了：蓬达尔区的党工作，至今仍处在不能令人满意的情况之下，而向省委那边源源不绝地发去的关于这方面的信号，却又一去无音讯，全达不到目的。
    共产党教养干部和全体苏维埃人民，务使人人乐意实行布尔什维克的批评和自我批评。斯大林同志教导说：批评和自我批评是我们的发展规律，是克服一切种种阻碍我们胜利前进的抱残守缺思想、衰老垂死现象的决定性手段。批评和自我批评的广泛开展，辉煌地体现着苏维埃制度的民主精神，体现着苏维埃人民——自己国家的全权主人翁和新生活创造者高度的政治觉悟。
    地方党组织所担负任务的顺利完成，必不可缺地有赖于开展布尔什维克的批评和自我批评，因为布尔什维克的批评和自我批评可以帮助消除缺点，可以帮助改进党的政治上和组织上的工作。我们的地方党组织在竭力提高对经济和文化建设的领导工作水平时，都是广泛地运用着批评和自我批评于自己的实践活动上的，都是细心地倾听着群众的声音、倾听着他们正确的批评意见和宝贵的建议，并把这些建议付诸实施的。
    可是，以形式主义的态度对待批评的事实，今天却仍然还有。
    布尔什维克的批评——是带原则性的和切合实际的批评，它对我们的要求并不是简单的确认或承认缺点，而是揭露产生这些缺点的原因，并采取必要的办法来消除它。口头上承认批评的正确，而实际上并不采取办法来消除或此或彼的恶劣现象，这种工作人员是在走错误的邪路。因之，他们实行迷惑舆论，使那些遭受批评的缺点有机会滋长起来。单是口头上承认批评的正确，而并不用消除缺点的斗争来确证这种承认，那实际上还是一种变相的压制批评。正确地、布尔什维克地，而不是形式主义官僚主义地对待批评——这意思就是不仅仅要承认缺点，而且——这一点是主要的——还要从实践上消除缺点，不再重复缺点。言行合一，决议和执行一致，这是布尔什维克领导作风的杰出特色。
    每一点正确的批评意见，不管是来自会上或是报上，受批评的组织和领导人都必须持以极郑重关心的态度，并须采取纠正的具体办法。党教导我们，对待缺点必须采取毫不调和的态度，必须迅速实行纠正，并且以后绝不再重复。斯大林同志指示说：“布尔什维克党人的义务不是掩饰自己的错误，不是规避有关自己错误的问题——像我们常有的现象似的；而是以诚恳磊落的态度承认自己的错误，是以诚恳磊落的态度拟定纠正这些错误的办法，是以诚恳磊落的态度实行纠正这些错误。”
    任何一种批评言论，只有当联系这种批评而采取的决定，像任何其他决定一样，由具体的行动、由合理组织的执行程度的检查来确证它的时候，才能达到目的并产生最大的效果。背离这个原则会有怎样的结果，从下面的事实可以看得清清楚楚：
    卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国共产党
    （布）中央委员会机关工作人员会议，曾经严厉批评党、工会及共青团组织部工作中的缺点，但批评并没有受到应有的重视，所以会议过后，情况也就毫无改变。只有等到报上发表了有关上述及其他缺点的通讯以后，卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国共产党（布）中央这才通过了一个决议，其中列举了一系列改进机关工作的办法。然而，决议并没有得到组织工作的确证。这从“真理报”前几天才接到的、党彼特罗查沃德斯克市委书记拉左夫同志的来信中，可以明白看出来：中央各部门的工作方法上，并没有什么显著的改进。他们照旧很少关心党市委和区委的活动内容，照旧没有给他们以应有的帮助，他们的工作只局限于搜集各种情况资料。
    布尔什维克的实事求是精神，对待批评的正确态度，这意思就是善于把既经开头的事情贯彻到底，就是善于有步骤地实事求是地确证既经采取的决定。好的决议——这仅仅是事情的开头。要使它产生预期的效果，就必须把它的执行组织起来。
    没有对批评和自我批评的关心，就不可能有对工作成就的真正关心。批评和自我批评不但可以迅速消除缺点和错误，而且还可以防止工作人员自满自傲情绪的危险性。斯大林同志再三警告说，不是盛气凌人，而是虚怀若谷才是布尔什维克的美德；任何一位领导人，不管他是在哪一个职位上，都无非是人民的公仆。布尔什维克的领导传统，不是别的，就是领导者同群众经常的联系，就是乐意向群众学习并乐意纠正由劳动人民所指出的缺点。
    要贯彻执行批评和自我批评的口号，就必须克服对它所取的形式主义态度，并和所有妨碍它开展的人们作坚决斗争，保护一切积极提出健康批评的人们免受迫害，务使正确的批评者感觉到自己后面是有集体的组织力量在支持着的。党教导说，一个布尔什维克，如果他坚持真理，如果他的言行符合党的理想、符合党的号召、符合党的决议、符合党的指示，那么，任便哪一个人和任便哪一件事，也休想把他推开正途。
    地方党组织的任务，也就是用尽一切方法来开展批评和自我批评，教养我们的干部和全体苏维埃人民去全心全意严格遵守国家的利益，全心全意采取毫不调和的态度对待缺点，对待一切阻碍我们前进的落后的旧事物。
