Panmunjom Chronicles
　　Three, Heroes' Conversation
　　Tian Jian
　　These days, I live in Songgodong.
　　Songgodong is very close to Panmunjom. Northeast of the village, on a small hill, a piece of red cloth is laid out. Crossing this piece of red cloth is the Panmunjom conference area.
　　As soon as I arrived here, our Volunteer Army soldiers and Korean villagers treated me very well, giving me a thatched cottage. Inside the cottage, there is a bottle of red roses on the table. The flowers are in bloom.
　　This cottage makes me very satisfied. Living here allows me to understand many issues; especially about the issues of war and peace. That day, as soon as I entered the house, I heard gunshots and artillery fire coming over, as if they were hitting Panmunjom, even as if they were hitting next to the tent. However, according to my estimation, they still don't dare. If the tents in Panmunjom are hit by shells from the American aggressors, then Panmunjom, that will be their graveyard!
　　Our soldiers, in order to defend peace, are adding to the fortifications. The soldiers building the fortifications need to go to the front and pass by the thatched cottage, they sit under the eaves to rest and talk. I heard a conversation between two soldiers:——
　　One soldier said:——This artillery fire sounds like it's hitting Panmunjom again.
　　Another soldier said:——The American devils have long wanted to knock over the tents in Panmunjom, but they don't dare.——We have our artillery, which is keeping them in check.——However, we are not willing to waste shells like they do; nor do we rely on shells for food, living by firing artillery.——American prisoners confessed: your (referring to us) artillery doesn't fire often, but when it does, it's really powerful; why do you (referring to us) fight so desperately? You hit us (referring to them) so hard that we don't even dare to go out.——That's how it is. The American devils still want to brag in the tents, or they yawn and say, you (referring to us) don't accept our (referring to them) plan, so let bombs, artillery, and bullets continue to argue.
　　They never want to sit in the tents and have a good negotiation, they always want to come to the mountains to negotiate. If they come up the mountain, let me give them a slap in the face, I'll tell them, in front of our positions, your artillery and bullets have no say!——Humph! American devils want to come to our mountains to negotiate? We'll give them a notice: if you want to negotiate, you have to sit in Panmunjom, you have to sit in the tents, and you're not allowed to move!——That's right. Our position
　　has trenches, but no tables, and even fewer
　　chairs. We have stretchers here, and we'll treat those who want to be prisoners
　　well. If they don't want to be prisoners, they'll have to leave their corpses behind.
　　We have artillery and stretchers, if they want to be prisoners, we
　　two can even carry them. For the sake of peace, we are not afraid of this
　　hardship!
　　This conversation is truly heroic, and it can shake mountains and rivers. It is a very good answer to the warmongers. I love this conversation, and I wrote it down in my diary; and I also wrote a short song, which can also be considered a few words of greeting, to congratulate our peace warriors: Listen, the brave warriors make a vow, singing in Korea, singing on the front lines, the brave warriors spare no blood and sweat, carrying peace on their shoulders. Row after row of high mountains are layers of fortresses, hundreds of miles of trenches and hundreds of miles of electric wires, with tanks and artillery lined up at the forefront. If the enemy dares to attack, their bayonets will be shattered, and they will be sunk forever into the sea, never daring to provoke the people again. Look at our peace warriors, standing on high mountains with the blue sky above their heads, determined to plant the banner of peace high on the 38th parallel!
　　As I watched these two soldiers walk towards the position, one soldier was carrying a very thick pine log on his shoulder, and the other soldier was carrying a gun on his shoulder, carrying an iron hoe, and his body was covered with mud, looking like coal miners, or like woodcutters. The soldiers on the mountain are all like this. Our soldiers are both soldiers and workers, truly all-powerful soldiers.
　　I am very proud that our motherland, under the education of Chairman Mao, has such good peace warriors, they are far away from the motherland, fighting hard every year, regarding peace as life, and regarding Korea as home. This makes me believe; on the alert line between war and peace, peace warriors will win, and warmongers will be defeated! Peace, peace, the two words peace, will definitely be written on the tents of Panmunjom.
　　I am not a military strategist, or even a soldier, I am an ordinary poet from Beijing, I want to pay tribute to the peace warriors in the name of a peace defender and a poet!

    板门店纪事
　　三、英雄的谈话
    田间
    这几天，我住在松古洞。
    松古洞离板门店很近。村的东北面，一个小山坡上，铺着一块红布板。跨过这块红布板，就是板门店会场区。
    我一来到这里，我们的志愿军和朝鲜老乡，很款待我，给我让出一间草舍。草舍里面，桌子上放着一瓶红月季花。花正开着。
    这一间草舍，使我十分满意。住在这里，使我知道许多问题；尤其是关于战争与和平的问题。那一天我刚一进屋，就听到枪声、炮声传过来，好像是往板门店打的，甚至好像是打在帐篷旁边。不过，照我的推测，他还不敢。如果板门店的帐篷上，落上美国侵略者的炮弹，板门店，这就是他们的坟墓！
    我们的战士，为了保卫和平，正在加修工事。修工事的战士，要到前面去，从草舍旁边路过，他们坐在屋檐下休息谈论。我听见两个战士的一段谈话：——
    这一个战士说：——这一声炮又好像是往板门店打的。另一个战士说：——美国鬼子早就想把板门店的帐篷打翻，他又不敢。——有我们的大炮，在管着它。——不过，我们不愿意像他们那样浪费炮弹；也不像他们那样拿炮弹当饭吃，靠打炮过日子。——美国俘虏自供：你们（指我们）的炮不打便罢，打起来也真厉害；你们为什么拚命地打？打得我们（指他们）连门也不敢出。——就是这么回事。美国鬼子还要在帐篷里吹牛，要不就打着呵欠说，你们
    （指我们）不接受我们（指他们）的方案，就让炸弹、大炮、子弹去继续争辩。
    他们总不愿坐在帐篷里好好谈判，总想要到山上来谈判。如果他们上山的话，让我来给他一个耳光，我来对他们说，在我们的阵地面前，你们的大炮、子弹没有发言权！——哼！美国鬼子想上山来找我们谈判？我们给他下个通知：要谈判就要坐在板门店，就要坐在帐篷帐里，坐在那儿不准动！——说的对。我们的阵
    地上有的是战壕，没有放着桌子，更没有放着
    椅子，这儿还有担架，愿当俘虏的，我们优待
    他，要不的话，来了就得把尸首丢下。
    我们有大炮，也有担架，愿当俘虏的话，咱
    俩还可以抬他。为了和平工作，咱们倒不怕这
    个辛苦！
    这一段对话，正是英雄气概，这能震动河山。是对战争贩子的一个很好的回答。我喜爱这一段对话，把它记在日记上；并且我也作了一首短歌，也算是写了几句赠言，祝贺我们的和平战士：听呵，勇士发出誓言，唱在朝鲜，唱在前线，勇士不惜血和汗，把和平担在两肩。一道道的高山上，是一层层的堡垒，千里战壕百里电线，坦克大炮排在前沿。要是敌人敢来进攻，他的刺刀就要粉碎，叫它永远沉下海水，再也不敢向人民挑衅。看我们的和平战士，脚踏高山头顶青天，决心要把和平大旗，高高地插在三八线！
    当我看着这两个战士往阵地上走时，一个战士肩上，扛着一根很粗的松木，另一个战士肩上，挎着一枝枪，扛着一把铁铣，身上染满泥土，很像是开煤矿的工人，又好像是樵夫。山上的一群战士，都是这样的。我们的战士，是战士又是工人，真是万能的战士。
    我很骄傲，我们的祖国，在毛主席的教养下，有这样好的和平战士，他们远离了祖国，年年苦战，视和平如生命，视朝鲜如家庭。这使我相信；在战争与和平的警戒线上，和平战士必胜，战争贩子必败！和平，和平，和平这两个字，一定会写在板门店的帐篷上。
    我不是一个军事家，甚至也不是一个军人，我是从北京来的一个普通诗人，我要以和平保卫者和诗人的名义，向和平战士致敬！
