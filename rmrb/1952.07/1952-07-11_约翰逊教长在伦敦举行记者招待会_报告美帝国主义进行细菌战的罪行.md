Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 10th: The Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, held a press conference in London on the 8th after returning from a recent visit to China. The conference was hosted by the Britain-China Friendship Association.

    Johnson said at the meeting that his main purpose in visiting China at the invitation of the China Peace Committee was to observe the tremendous changes in the lives of the people since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He described in detail the amazing progress made by the Chinese people and emphasized that the Chinese people earnestly hope for peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Johnson then spoke about what he had seen of the U.S. conducting germ warfare. He said he had not been to Korea. Regarding the U.S. germ warfare attacks on Northeast China, he said, "The factual evidence of germ warfare is conclusive and undeniable. The truth cannot be concealed." Johnson presented the evidence he had seen of the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons. He described the evidence displayed at the exhibitions in Beijing and Shenyang, and pointed out that the people who collected these exhibits were world-renowned, and no one doubted their objectivity, honesty, and scientific accomplishments. Johnson cited the confessions of U.S. pilots Quinn and Enock, and described what he saw when he visited three places in Northeast China where germ bombs had fallen. In those places, he saw germ-carrying insects in test tubes. He also spoke with Chinese Christians who had witnessed the air raids firsthand. Johnson also cited statements by Chinese Christians confirming the evidence of germ warfare. He produced at the meeting several original documents of protests with many Chinese church leaders' signatures, some as long as ten yards. One document had the signatures of four hundred and ten church leaders, including four Anglican bishops and two Methodist pastors. Johnson said that this protest would be on public display in the library of Canterbury Cathedral. He also showed reporters another signature, this one by Chinese Catholic leaders in Beijing, who asked Johnson to spread their appeal not only in Britain but throughout the Western world. Johnson said: This is the voice of millions of Chinese Christians. I will spread these Christians' powerful appeals among the archbishops and bishops of our Anglican Church, and also among the leaders of the various churches represented by these bishops.

    Johnson answered many questions raised by British and American reporters at the meeting. When a reporter mentioned an investigation of germ warfare by the Swiss International Red Cross, Johnson said, "There cannot be a fair body if it does not include the people of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea."

    报告美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行
    【新华社布拉格十日电】最近访问中国后回国的坎特伯雷教长约翰逊八日在伦敦举行记者招待会。这次招待会是由英中友好协会主持举行的。
    约翰逊在会上发表谈话说：他这次应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的邀请访问中国，主要目的是观察中华人民共和国建国以来人民生活的巨大变化。他详细地描绘了中国人民取得的惊人进步，并强调指出中国人民热切希望全世界和平共处。约翰逊接着谈到他看到的美国进行细菌战的情形。他说他没有到朝鲜。关于美国对中国东北进行的细菌袭击的情形，他说：“细菌战的事实证据确凿，无可争辩。真相是隐瞒不了的。”约翰逊提出了他所看到的关于美军使用细菌武器的证据。他叙述了北京和沈阳展览会上陈列的证据，并且指出搜集这些陈列品的人都是世界闻名的人，没有人怀疑他们的客观、诚实和科学修养。约翰逊引证了美国飞行员奎恩和伊纳克的供词，并叙述了他访问中国东北的三个落过细菌炸弹的地方的情形。在那些地方，他看到装在试管里的带细菌的昆虫。他并和亲眼看到空袭的中国基督教徒谈过话。约翰逊又援引了中国基督教徒证实细菌战证据的声明。他在会议上拿出几份上面有许多中国教会领袖签名的抗议书原文文件，有的抗议书长达十码。有一个文件上有四百零十个教会领袖的签名，其中包括四个圣公会主教和两个卫理公会牧师。约翰逊说这个抗议书将在坎特伯雷大教堂的图书馆公开展览。他还拿出了另一份签名给记者们看，签名的人都是北京的中国天主教领袖，他们要求约翰逊不仅在英国，而且在整个西方世界传播他们的呼吁。约翰逊说：这是千百万中国基督教徒的呼声。我要在我们圣公会的大主教与主教中间来传布这些基督教徒的有力的呼吁，还要在这些主教所代表的各教会的领袖中间传布这一呼吁。
    约翰逊在会上答复了许多英、美记者所提出的问题，在记者提到由瑞士的国际红十字会调查细菌战时，约翰逊说：“如果不包括苏、中、朝人民，就不能有公正的团体。”
