Xinhua News Agency, April 28th:

Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, has issued an open letter to Red Cross members worldwide, exposing the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in Korea and China, and calling for united action to stop this crime. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Red Cross Members:

Entrusted by the 500 million peace-loving people of the People's Republic of China, I led the "Investigation Group on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes," composed of representatives from all Chinese people's organizations, democratic parties, and experts in entomology, bacteriology, parasitology, rickettsiology, virology, pathology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, public health, chemistry, biology, agronomy, and veterinary medicine, to conduct investigations in Korea and Northeast China on March 15, 1952. This task has now been completed.

The extensive evidence obtained by our "Investigation Group on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" has fully proven the crimes of American imperialism in waging germ warfare. We have collected various poisonous insects, toxic substances, and bacterial bomb casings dropped and scattered by the American aggressors in Northeast China and Korea. These poisonous insects and toxic substances were scattered in Korean territory and Northeast China through methods such as airdrops, spray dispersal, artillery fire, and the throwing of bacterial bombs. Among the poisonous insects, the main ones are blowflies (black flies), fleas, black springtails (snow fleas), stoneflies, midges, spiders, ticks, etc. Among the toxic substances, the main ones are cotton, chicken feathers, medicines, food, and other items. There are also rats, snakes, crows, dead pigs, dead fish, etc. These poisonous insects and toxic substances are all attached with highly toxic bacteria that have been artificially cultured and transplanted. After precise examination, experts have found various bacteria and viruses such as plague, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery, anthrax, rickettsia, and acute encephalitis virus. American prisoners of war, such as Private First Class Marvin L. Brown (serial number 18397178) of "K" Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 3rd Division, and Private First Class Dalling Epps (serial number 14384491) of "G" Company, 179th Regiment, 45th Division, as well as airborne special agent Han Zhengyu, etc., have also confessed to the deliberate preparation and deployment of germ warfare by American imperialists. Of course, all this evidence cannot be fully described in this short space. During the investigation, we have photographed a large number of witnesses and material evidence, and recorded the testimonies of witnesses. The detailed written report of our investigation has been made public to all peace-loving people in the world. Here, as a witness to this crime, I solemnly declare to you: The evil acts committed by American imperialists cannot be concealed by any sophistry, nor can they be denied by any doubt. All evidence has proven that American imperialism has already degenerated to the point of being an enemy of all mankind!

When I personally saw all the evidence of American aggressors conducting germ warfare, and when I personally heard the accusations and confessions made by witnesses to this crime (including local residents, American prisoners of war, and American airborne special agents), a strong feeling of anger agitated me for a long time and was difficult to restrain! This vicious means employed by the American aggressors is an attempt to salvage the disastrous defeat of its arrogantly touted "air and sea superiority," and is an attempt to achieve the aggressive goals that it cannot achieve at the Korean armistice negotiation table and on the Korean battlefield. However, this means cannot intimidate the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese and Korean people are working hard to eliminate the harm of germ warfare, and the American aggressors have not achieved the effects they expected. Based on preliminary experience in defending against germ warfare, the Chinese and Korean people have full confidence in eliminating any further germ warfare that the American aggressors may continue to wage.

Of course, we have protested and condemned the crimes committed by the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield more than once. Bombing peaceful cities and villages in Korea, using poison gas, massacring prisoners of war, bombing hospitals marked with the Red Cross, violating our country's airspace, etc. This series of violations of international conventions is already well known to the world. At the Board of Governors and Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies in Geneva, I have repeatedly protested and appealed. And today, the crimes of the American aggressors have developed to the point of using large-scale germ weapons to exterminate mankind! This unprecedented crime is still being planned to continue and expand. Therefore, Red Cross members, if we cannot completely stop this bloody criminal act of the American aggressors, it is not difficult to deduce: the pestilence and death held in the hands of Acheson and Ridgway, who are still attempting to evade responsibility through cunning and shameless denials, will one day harm the lives of all mankind.

Dear Red Cross Members, we are all Red Cross workers, we are all part of eliminating human disasters, advocating humanity, and defending mankind. Today, the crimes of American imperialists brazenly violating international law, violating the resolutions and conventions of the International Red Cross Conference and the League of Red Cross Societies, are an insult to human civilization and dignity. This is something that every Red Cross worker cannot tolerate and cannot remain silent about. This is a matter of conscience and morality, a matter of cherishing the civilization of all mankind, maintaining the dignity of international law, and ensuring the safety of mothers and children. What appears before us today – Red Cross workers who serve the happiness and well-being of mankind – is: defending the spirit of the Red Cross, upholding humanitarianism, and protesting and sanctioning those who violate and undermine the Red Cross conventions!

Dear Red Cross Members, you have all been or intend to devote yourselves to the cause of eliminating human disasters and upholding humanitarianism. I sincerely hope that under the responsibility of upholding human dignity, you will immediately unite with all peace-loving and humanitarian individuals within the United Nations, and take concerted action to impose just condemnation and effective sanctions on the American imperialists' cruel and violent acts of germ warfare that threaten all mankind.

Li Dequan
President of the Red Cross Society of China

    李德全向全世界红十字会员发出公开信
    呼吁一致制止美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国红十字会总会会长李德全发出了给全世界红十字会会员们的一封公开信，揭发美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行，并呼吁一致行动起来制止这一罪行。这封信的全文如下：亲爱的红十字会会员们：
    我接受了爱好和平的中华人民共和国五亿人民的委托，率领着包括全中国各人民团体、各民主党派的代表人士，以及昆虫学、细菌学、寄生虫学、立克次氏体学、病毒学、病理学、临床医学、流行病学、公共卫生学、化学、生物学、农学及兽医学等各种专家所组成的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，于一九五二年三月十五日出发前往朝鲜及我国东北地区进行调查，现在已完成是项工作。
    我们“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”调查所得的大量罪证都已经充分地证明美帝国主义进行细菌战争的罪行。我们在我国东北地区及朝鲜，已经搜集了美国侵略者所投放与撒布的各种毒虫、毒物和细菌弹壳等。这些毒虫毒物通过空投、喷雾撒布、大炮放射及投掷细菌弹等方式投撒在朝鲜境内及我国东北地区。在毒虫之中，主要的有花蝇（黑蝇）、跳蚤、黑跳虫（雪蚤）、襀翅虫（石蝇）、摇蚊、蜘蛛、扁虱等；在毒物之中，主要的有棉花、鸡毛、药品、食品及其他物品。还有老鼠、蛇、乌鸦、死猪、死鱼等。这些毒虫、毒物都附有经过人工培养移植的毒性很强的细菌。这些毒虫毒物，经过精密检验的结果，专家们发现有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾、炭疽、立克次氏体以及急性脑炎病毒等各种细菌与病毒。而美俘第三师第七团第三营“K”连一等兵马汶·L·勃朗（军号一八三九七一七八）、第四十五师一七九团“G”连上等兵达林·爱普斯（军号一四三八四四九一）等及空降特务韩正玉等也都供认了美帝国主义者处心积虑地进行细菌战的准备与布置的情况。这一切罪证当然不可能是这一点点篇幅所能述其万一的。在调查中，我们已将大量的人证、物证拍摄成照片与电影，并已将见证人的谈话作了录音。我们这一次调查所得的详细的书面报告已公诸于全世界一切爱好和平的人民之前。这里，我以这一罪行的证人的身份郑重地对你们声明：美帝国主义者所进行的罪恶行为，绝不是什么狡赖所能掩饰的，绝不是什么疑惑所能否定的，一切罪证都已证明美帝国主义早已堕落到与全世界人类为敌的地步！
    当我亲眼看到了美国侵略者进行细菌战争的一切罪证、当我亲自听到这一罪行的证人（包括当地居民、美国俘虏及美军空降特务）所提出的控诉与供词时，一种强烈的愤怒情绪长时间地使我激动，难以遏止！美国侵略者这种狠毒的手段，是企图挽救它所狂妄鼓吹的“海空优势”的惨败，是企图达到它在朝鲜停战谈判会议桌上和在朝鲜战场上所不能达到的侵略目的。但是，这种手段是不能吓倒中国和朝鲜人民的，中国和朝鲜人民正在努力扑灭细菌战的危害，美国侵略者没有达到它们所预期的效果。中国和朝鲜人民根据防御细菌战初步的经验，已有充分的信心来扑灭美国侵略者可能继续的细菌战。
    当然，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上所犯的罪行，我们已经不止一次地控诉与抗议过。滥炸朝鲜和平城市与乡村、施放毒气、残杀俘虏、轰炸设有红十字标志的医院、侵犯我国的领空等等，这一系列的违反国际公约的行为，早为世人所共知。在日内瓦红十字会协会理事会及执委会上，我曾一再提出抗议与呼吁。而今日，美国侵略者的罪行已发展到施用大规模消灭人类的细菌武器了！这种史无前例的罪行还在有计划地继续与扩大。因此，红十字会会员们，如果我们不能彻底制止美国侵略者这一血腥的犯罪行为，不难推断：仍在企图以狡黠无耻的抵赖来卸脱罪责的艾奇逊、李奇微之流手中所握的疫癘与死亡，他日将如何地危害全人类的生命。
    亲爱的红十字会会员们，我们都是红十字工作者，我们都是消灭人类灾难、主张人道与维护人类的一分子。今天，美帝国主义者悍然破坏国际公法、违反国际红十字大会及红十字会协会的决议和公约的罪行都是对人类文明和尊严的污辱，这是每
    一个从事红十字工作者所不能容忍和所不能缄默的，这是一个良心与道德的问题，这是一个对全人类文明的珍爱、对国际公法尊严的维护、对母亲们和孩子们安全的保障的问题。今天出现在我们——为人类幸福与康乐服务的红十字工作者面前的是：保卫红十字精神，维护人道主义、抗议与制裁那些对红十字公约的违反者与破坏者！
    亲爱的红十字会会员们，你们都是曾经或打算致力于消灭人类灾难、维护人道主义的事业上的。我衷心地希望你们在维护人道主义尊严的责任下，立即联合国内所有爱好和平、维护人道的人士，一致行动起来对美帝国主义者所进行的细菌战争这一威胁全人类的残酷狂暴行为，施以正义的声讨和有效的制裁。
    中国红十字会总会会长李德全
    四月二十八日
