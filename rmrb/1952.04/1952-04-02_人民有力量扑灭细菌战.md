The People Have the Power to Eradicate Germ Warfare
Ma Jia

On March 4th, the US Secretary of State Acheson shamelessly said: "The US military has not conducted and is not conducting any germ warfare." His shameless lies cannot cover up their crimes. On that very day at 10:00 AM, eight American planes appeared over the Jiuliancheng area of Andong, scattering black mosquitoes, like a black belt, floating down along the Yalu River; then various insects carrying bacteria were also found on the mountains near Andong. Now, seeing these poisonous insects in Andong is easier than seeing American prisoners of war in Korea.

As soon as I arrived in Andong, I saw small black mosquitoes. In a comrade's home, I also saw a large fly. The fly was about two and a half times larger than the flies in Northeast China, with long legs, large wings, and a blackish-gray color. Seeing these poisonous insects, I didn't feel afraid, only disgusted, abhorrent, and resentful. This cannot help but connect them with the hateful names of Truman, Acheson, and Ridgway.

Acheson's denial and lying are not surprising. There is a Chinese saying: "Ivory cannot be extracted from a dog's mouth." Similarly, it is impossible to get the truth out of Acheson's mouth. When the US imperialists occupied our territory of Taiwan, didn't they also say that it was not an act of aggression?

The war-mongers' crimes cannot be hidden from the eyes of the people. Their sinister tails were revealed long ago. As early as January 1946, Merck, Chairman of the US Army Biological Warfare Committee, revealed in a "Report to the Secretary of the Army on Germ Warfare" that the United States had an organization called the "Military Research Office" during World War II, which began research on complete germ weapons. On March 12, 1949, Forrestal, the former US Secretary of Defense, stated: "Our research shows that bacteria or their toxic products can be effectively used as weapons of war." Theodore Rosebury, a professor at Columbia University who participated in the manufacture of germ weapons at Camp Detrick, wrote a book called "Peace or Pestilence" in 1949. On page 61 of this book, he wrote: "It can eliminate people or exploit their labor without destroying their property." Listen, how much this sounds like the tone of a slave of monopoly capitalists! Just like the tone of Acheson, who is a lawyer hired by the Morgan, DuPont, and Rockefeller families, it couldn't be more blatant. Isn't it these man-eating brutes who used to trade black people, collect head taxes, enact the Taft-Hartley Act, and ship scrap iron to Japan to help the Japanese fascists slaughter the Chinese people during the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan?

Acheson cannot deny it. In Andong, flies usually appear in May, and mosquitoes in August. On the day the American planes scattered bacterial insects, the weather in Andong was minus eight degrees Celsius. Historically, local insects cannot survive in such a climate.

The US imperialists spread bacteria, deny it, and play dead, attempting to escape the condemnation of world opinion, but they cannot play dead for long. Didn't the American aggressors come up with this "new weapon" only after suffering defeats in Korea? This "new weapon" will not save the American aggressors from their doomed fate. On the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors have used many new weapons in various ways, such as timed bombs, caltrops, gasoline bombs, etc., but they have not saved them from their fate of defeat.

Last spring, when the American aggressors withdrew from North Korea, they scattered smallpox bacteria. On March 19th last year, I traveled from Andong to Sinuiju, Korea. It was late at night, and I stayed in an empty house. The next day, I discovered that the next room was also a dilapidated house, filled with broken quilts, broken clothes, and broken pants. In the dilapidated family were three children, the youngest being two years old, with a small face peeking out from the broken quilt, crying straight away. The older child was only six years old, with long hair, naked buttocks, and got up to coax his younger brother. The second child had smallpox, was drowsy, and could not move. Someone told me that their mother had been raped to death by American devils! Their father had been bombed to death by American planes not long ago; in their home, there were also long pants worn by adults, and a picture album promoting the "American way of life." This is a real depiction of the American aggressors promoting their "way of life," this is propaganda in the truest sense, is there any need to explain it with words and writing!

Dying imperialism is war, is plague, is bacteria. As long as we slightly recall history and think about Hitler and Tojo, those demons, and the disasters they brought to mankind, we will have a clearer understanding of US imperialism.

The great Chinese and Korean people will not be intimidated by the germ warfare of the US imperialists. We have the confidence and ability to eradicate it and achieve victory!

On March 18th, all the people of Andong held demonstrations and rallies against germ warfare. The masses, carrying various weapons for capturing and killing bacteria, marched in ranks, heading towards the front line of eradicating bacteria!

Qu Mingshan, a model agricultural producer, told me: "The residents of the 17th Neighborhood Committee of Langtou Street, Langtou District, captured seven catties of poisonous insects on March 19th."

Granny Jiao, a model in supporting the army in Andong, wrote a letter to her son in Korea after the American planes scattered bacterial poisonous insects, challenging her son. Determined to use active actions to combat the American aggressors, she organized women, more than 120 women, carrying flags and various weapons for exterminating poisonous insects, to kill poisonous insects. Granny Jiao mobilized the women, saying: "The more insects we catch, the more American devils we eliminate. Everyone puts the insects into small bottles and puts their names on them. Even if the American devils don't admit it, it won't work. This is evidence from people and material evidence." Under her influence, women followed her to kill insects.

I have been in Andong for several days. I have not only seen the bacterial poisonous insects scattered by American planes, but also the Chinese people's spirit of fighting against the enemy, which is the spirit of the victor. We are fully determined and have the strength to eradicate the vicious germ warfare of US imperialism!

    人民有力量扑灭细菌战
    马加
    三月四日，美国国务卿艾奇逊厚颜无耻地说：“美军过去未进行，现在也未进行任何细菌战。”他的这些无耻谎言，是掩盖不住他们的罪行的。就在他说话的这天上午十点钟，在安东九连城一带出现了八架美国飞机，撒下黑色的蚊虫，像一条黑带子，顺着鸭绿江水飘下来；接着在安东附近的山上也发现了各式各样带着细菌的昆虫。现在，想在安东看见这种毒虫，比在朝鲜看见美国的俘虏还要容易。
    我刚到安东，就看见了黑色小蚊子。在一个同志的家里，我还看见了大苍蝇。那苍蝇要比东北的苍蝇大两倍半的样子，长腿，大翅膀，黑灰色。我看见这样的毒虫，并不觉得可怕，只觉得讨厌，憎恶，愤恨。这不能不使我把它们和杜鲁门、艾奇逊、李奇微这些使人可憎恶的名字联在一起。
    艾奇逊的抵赖和说谎是不足奇怪的。中国老百姓有一句话：“狗嘴里掏不出象牙来。”同样，要从艾奇逊的嘴里吐出实话来也是不可能的。当美帝国主义者侵占我国领土台湾时，不也曾说过那不是侵略的行为么？
    战争贩子们的罪行是瞒不住人们的眼睛的。他们罪恶的尾巴很早就露出来了。还在一九四六年一月，美国陆军生物战争委员会主席墨尔克在“关于细菌战争给陆军部长的报告”中就曾透露：美国在第二次世界大战中就已有一个以“军事研究处为名的机构，开始研究完备的细菌武器的工作”。一九四九年三月十二日，曾任美国国防部长的福莱斯特尔发表声明说：“我们的研究说明，细菌或者它们有毒的生成物可以有效地用作战争武器。”曾在狄特黑克营参加制造细菌武器的美国哥伦比亚大学教授提奥多尔·罗兹伯里，在一九四九年写了一本名叫“和平或是瘟疫”的书。在这本书的第六十一页上写道：“它可以消灭人或剥削他们的劳动能力，而不破坏他们的财产。”大家听听，这多么像独占资本家奴才的口吻！正如艾奇逊是摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒三大家族雇用的律师的口吻一样，再露骨也没有了。曾经贩卖黑人，征收人头税，制定塔夫脱—哈特莱法案，在中国抗日时期，把废铁运到日本，帮助日本法西斯屠杀中国人民的，不就是这些吃人生番么？
    艾奇逊是抵赖不了的。在安东市这地方，到了五月间才有苍蝇，八月才有蚊子。当美国飞机撒下细菌昆虫那天，安东市的天气是零下八度。从历史上，本地昆虫就不能在这样的气候下生存。
    美帝国主义撒了细菌，抵赖，耍死狗，企图逃脱全世界舆论的斥责，但死狗是耍不了几天的。美国侵略者不是在朝鲜吃了败仗才拿出这个“新武器”么？这个“新武器”也同样不能挽救美国侵略者的失败命运。在朝鲜战场上，美国侵略者曾经花样翻新地使用过许多新武器，如什么定时弹、四角钉、汽油弹等等，但并没有挽救他们失败的命运。
    去年春天，美国侵略者从北朝鲜撤退的时候，曾经撒了天花细菌。去年三月十九日那天，我从安东到朝鲜新城川，正是深夜，我投到一个空屋子去住宿。到了第二天，我才发现隔壁也是一间破屋子，里面堆着破棉被、破衣裳、破裤子。在破烂不堪的家庭中有三个孩子，小的有两岁，从破被里露出小脸蛋，直是哭。大的孩子才有六岁，长头发，光着屁股，爬起来哄他的弟弟。第二个孩子生了天花，昏昏沉沉，不能动弹。有人告诉我说，他们的妈妈叫美国鬼子强奸死了！他们的爸爸在不久以前叫美国飞机炸死了；在他们的家里，还扔下大人穿的长裤子，和一册宣传“美国生活方式”的画报。这就是美国侵略者推行他们“生活方式”的写实，这就是名符其实的宣传，难道还要用语言和文字来说明么！
    垂死的帝国主义就是战争，就是瘟疫，就是细菌。只要我们稍微回忆一下历史，想想希特勒和东条这些魔鬼，他们给人类带来的灾难，就会更清楚地认识美帝国主义。
    伟大的中朝人民是不会被美帝国主义的细菌战吓倒的。我们有信心也一定能扑灭它，获得胜利！
    三月十八日，安东全市人民举行了反对细菌战的示威和誓师大会。群众带着捕杀细菌的各种武器，排着队伍，浩浩荡荡地走到扑灭细菌的前线！
    农业生产模范曲明山告诉我说：“浪头区浪头街十七板居民，在三月十九日那天，扑了毒虫七斤”。
    安东市拥军模范缴大娘，当美国飞机撒了细菌毒虫以后，她给她的在朝鲜的儿子写了信，和儿子挑战。决心用积极行动来打击美国侵略者，她把妇女组织起来了，一百二十多个妇女，打着旗子，带着各种扑灭毒虫的武器，去扑杀毒虫。缴大娘动员妇女说：“咱们多抓一个虫子，就是多消灭一个美国鬼子。大家把虫子装到小瓶里，贴上自己的名字，美国鬼子不承认也不成，这就是人证物证”。在她的影响下，妇女们纷纷跟着她去扑杀虫子。
    我到安东市已经有几天了，我不仅看见了美国飞机撒下的细菌毒虫，我更看见了中国人民对敌斗争的气魄，这是胜利者的气魄。我们完全有决心有力量扑灭美帝国主义恶毒的细菌战！
