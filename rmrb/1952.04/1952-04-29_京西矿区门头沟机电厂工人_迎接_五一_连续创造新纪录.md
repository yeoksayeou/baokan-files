    Workers of the Mentougou Electrical and Mechanical Plant in the Jingxi Mining Area
    Continuously Set New Records in Welcoming "May Day"
    To the Editor: Workers of the Mentougou Electrical and Mechanical Plant in the Jingxi Mining Area launched a production campaign to welcome "May Day," continuously setting new records. The workers of the riveting and forging department of this factory first challenged the entire factory, guaranteeing to complete the April coal car production task four days ahead of schedule and save two hundred and forty workdays. In the past, they could turn out fifteen coal car drawbars per workday and fifty coal car clips per workday, with many not meeting specifications. After workers Su Fuji and Wang Jingzhen improved the tools, they could turn out forty-five drawbars per workday and fifty clips per hour, increasing work efficiency by eight times; moreover, the quality reached one hundred percent compliance with standards. Workers in the lathe department improved their operating techniques, turning out screws for tank axle clips, increasing from fifty per workday to one hundred and sixty; the efficiency of turning tank wheels and tank tiles both increased fourfold compared to before, and not a single defective product was produced. The workers also launched a "finding tricks" movement. In the past, the asphalt outlet of the iron furnace in the casting department used rush pith for padding; because rush pith was soft, sand would break it under pressure, often resulting in defective products. After the workers studied and changed to using waxed thread, the defective product rate was greatly reduced. On April 12th, the finished products meeting specifications reached 99.9 percent. At the same time, the amount of molten iron was also greatly increased, completing castings of more than four tons, which had never been cast before. The drainage department and the fitter department have also achieved excellent results in production. Now, the workers of each department are preparing to create newer records as gifts for "May Day."

    京西矿区门头沟机电厂工人
    迎接“五一”连续创造新纪录
    编辑同志：京西矿区门头沟机电厂工人迎接“五一”，展开生产竞赛，连续创造了新纪录。这个工厂的铆锻工部的工人首先向全厂提出挑战，他们保证提前四天完成四月份的制煤车生产任务，并节省二百四十个工。他们过去每工镟煤车的拉条十五个，每工镟煤车的卡子五十根，还有许多不合规格。经工人苏福记、王景振改进了工具后，每工可镟拉条四十五个；每小时镟卡子五十根，提高工作效率八倍；而且质量达到百分之百的合乎标准。车工部工人改进了操作技术，镟罐轴卡子螺丝，自每工五十根提高到一百六十根；镟罐轮及罐瓦都比前提高效率四倍，也没有出过一件废品。工人们还展开了找窍门运动。铸工部铸铁炉的沥清出口过去用灯心草垫眼；因灯心草软，沙子一压就坏了，常出废品。工人研究改用腊线后，大大降低了废品率。四月十二日，成品合乎规格的达到百分之九十九点九。同时，化铁量也大大提高，完成了从未铸过的四吨多的铸件。排水部、钳工部在生产上都获得了优异的成绩。现在各部工人准备创造更新的纪录，作为给“五一”节的献礼。    佟屏亚
