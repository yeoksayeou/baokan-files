To the Editors:

    Zhang Yuxian, the capitalist of the Beijing Masses Kiln, has consistently oppressed and cruelly exploited workers. He is hostile to the trade union and uses his henchman, the accountant Ren He, to control the workers. For more than three months, he has been in arrears with workers' wages amounting to more than 20 million yuan. He used this money to open a Xinghua Kiln. During the anti-theft movement, he did not honestly explain his problems and refused to give the workers food, intending to starve them away. The workers could not find him, as he hid in the city, avoiding them. The workers were so hungry that they had to borrow 250,000 yuan from the Labor Bureau to buy food. Did he really have no money? No. The Masses Kiln still has 200,000 unfired bricks, more than 30,000 black bricks, and 20 tons of coal; the Xinghua Kiln also has many materials. Li Bingxiao, the organization committee member of the factory's trade union, reasoned with him, but he shamelessly said, "Whatever! I've wanted to go to court for a long time." The workers are extremely resentful of this rogue capitalist and unanimously demand that the government deal with him according to the law.

    奸商张玉贤虐待工人应依法处理
    编辑同志：北京群众窑资方张玉贤，一贯压迫和残酷剥削工人。他仇视工会，利用他的狗腿子会计员任和统治工人。三个多月，他拖欠工人工资达二千多万元。他把这些钱用来开了一个兴华窑。在反盗窃运动中，他不老老实实交代问题，不给工人吃饭，打算饿走工人。工人们找也找不着他，他躲在城内，避而不见。工人们饿得无法，只得从劳动局借二十五万元买饭吃。他是真没钱了吗？不是的。群众窑还存着二十万块坯子，三万多块黑砖，二十吨煤；兴华窑也有很多物料。厂里的工会组织委员李秉孝同他说理，他无耻地说：“随便吧！我早想上法院了。”工人们对这个耍无赖的奸商都感到万分痛恨，一致要求政府依法处办。
