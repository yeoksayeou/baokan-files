    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th. More than one hundred medical personnel from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, local doctors from Lhasa, and Lama doctors from the Lhasa Jiagushan Pharmaceutical Temple of the Tibetan local government's Mentzi Tang (i.e., Medical Administration Bureau), gathered to denounce the towering crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Northeast China. Those present were extremely angry and expressed their willingness to take practical actions to crush this inhuman conspiracy of American imperialists. Tuden Longzhu Lama, one of the heads of Mentzi Tang, said indignantly: "This criminal act of American imperialism, which attempts to destroy humanity, completely violates the doctrines of our Buddhism. The Tibetan monks and laypeople who believe in Buddhism should unanimously oppose germ warfare. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will surely be able to completely eliminate the bacteria spread by American imperialism." Losang Yangpei, a local doctor in Lhasa, expressed his willingness to work with the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa to study germ warfare defense work and serve the people of Tibet together. Zhang Tianbin, Director of the Medical Affairs Department of the Health Department of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, called on all medical personnel stationed in Lhasa to unite closely with Tibetan local doctors, do a good job in medical work in Tibet, and ensure the health of the Tibetan people and border soldiers; and to widely carry out propaganda work against germ warfare.

    拉萨医务人员集会声讨美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社拉萨十五日电】人民解放军驻拉萨部队的医务工作人员、拉萨市地方医生和西藏地方政府门子唐（即医管局）拉萨甲古山医药寺院的喇嘛医生一百多人，集会声讨美帝国主义在我国东北撒布细菌的滔天罪行。与会者都极为愤怒，纷纷表示要以实际行动粉碎美帝国主义者这一绝灭人性的阴谋。门子唐负责人之一土丹龙珠喇嘛激愤地说：“美帝国主义这种企图毁灭人类的罪恶行为，完全违背了我们佛教的教义，信仰佛教的西藏僧俗人民都应该一致反对细菌战争。今天在毛主席的领导下，我们一定能够彻底消灭美帝国主义所撒布的细菌。”拉萨市地方医生洛桑扬培表示愿意和人民解放军驻拉萨的医务工作者一起研究细菌战防御工作，共同为西藏人民服务。人民解放军驻拉萨部队卫生部医务主任张天彬号召驻拉萨的全体医务工作人员，要和西藏地方医生亲密团结，作好西藏地方的医务工作，保证西藏人民和边疆战士的健康；并应广泛展开反细菌战的宣传工作。
