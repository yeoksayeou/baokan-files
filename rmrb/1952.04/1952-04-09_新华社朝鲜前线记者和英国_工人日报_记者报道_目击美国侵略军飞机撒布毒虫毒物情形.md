Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 7th: Two of our agency's reporters covering the Korean front have personally witnessed American aggressor planes spreading poisonous insects and substances. These two crimes by American planes were carried out brazenly in broad daylight; in the past, they often did it stealthily at night or on cloudy, foggy days.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Dai Huang, covering the central front, reported: On the night of March 23rd, I was traveling along the Huaiyang-to-Pingkang highway to the front. That night, it was snowing and the weather turned unusually cold. The car driver and I stayed overnight in Xipuli. The next day, the weather cleared and the blue sky had only a few white clouds. At around 9:00 AM, I suddenly heard the sound of an airplane engine approaching from a distance. I immediately ran out of the room and hid myself to observe. I saw a twin-engine American plane flying from southeast to northwest at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. When the plane flew over an area about five kilometers northwest of Xipuli, it turned due north, and then turned east again. Just as it was about to turn southeast, the plane sprayed a mist-like substance from its tail, spraying once every three seconds, for a total of three times. These mist-like substances were dispersed by the wind in the air and slowly fell down. At lower altitudes, it was possible to distinguish that they were many colored leaflets. My eyes continued to watch the enemy plane. Then I saw the returning plane spraying a puff of yellow mist from its tail twice. After that, the plane flew southeast. In a short while, the mist sprayed by the enemy plane dissipated in the air. People ran to the direction where the enemy plane sprayed the mist. They found the bacterial insects spread by the enemy plane on a high ground about three kilometers northwest of Xipuli. I saw that on the ridge of this snow-covered nameless high ground, over an area of about 100 meters from north to south and about 70 meters from east to west, there were earth-yellow caterpillars and flies everywhere, with about 300 or more per square meter in the densest areas. These poisonous insects were quickly exterminated by the local government and people.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Yan Wu, covering the western front, reported: At 11:40 AM on April 2nd, while I was investigating the American aggressors' germ warfare crimes with Professor Wei Xi, a bacteriology expert, and others, several planes suddenly flew over this area. The planes were flying very high, making it difficult to see clearly. After circling in the high altitude for about 20 minutes, these planes began to spray things in clusters, which then scattered into countless spots in the clear sky. When these things sprayed by the enemy planes fell near the ground, we saw that they were brownish-yellow oak leaves. As the oak leaves floated to the ground, Professor Wei Xi quickly opened his work clothes to catch a few. Then, American planes scattered many winged flying insects, and these insects fell on us. Because the enemy planes were afraid of being shot down by ground anti-aircraft fire, they never dared to fly low, but just buzzed at high altitude. After the enemy planes flew away, the local troops and residents immediately rushed to exterminate the poisonous insects and substances together. Professor Wei Xi is the deputy captain of the Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-epidemic and Inspection Team to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and also a member of the "Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by US Imperialism." After arriving at the Korean front, he has been running around everywhere, conducting investigations and inspections intensively. This time, he and I personally saw the American planes spreading bacteria-carrying poisonous insects and substances, and personally collected evidence of the American aggressors' germ warfare. He told reporters that he has become a powerful witness to accuse the crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: British "Workers' Daily" reporter Alan Winnington reported from the headquarters of a certain anti-epidemic committee in Korea: On the 2nd, I personally witnessed an American bacteriological air raid. This is absolutely conclusive proof that the Americans are waging bacteriological warfare. I was driving a jeep through a remote mountainous area to a place that had been subjected to a bacteriological air raid. On the road, we stopped in a wide valley to eat something. A plane flew overhead, so high that it was difficult for us to see it. About twenty minutes later, I noticed some small dots falling from the very high sky. We watched them, and as they fell lower, we could see that they were brown tree leaves—several hundred of them. We caught some in the air. Suddenly, the sky was also full of winged, fluttering insects, many of which landed on us. Within a few minutes, we caught dozens of them with chopsticks. At this time, there was only a very slight wind—too small to blow the leaves off the nearby mountains. However, to be on the safe side, we selected some samples from the various leaves nearby. These leaves were of a different kind, and had been weathered by wind and rain, and were covered with dirt, while those that fell from the sky were shiny, clean, although there were some fungal growths on them. I walked about 300 yards against the wind and did not see any traces of flies or leaves. When I returned to the jeep, I found that the sky was still full of flies, which flew strongly when they came down. We stopped traveling and waited there to see what would happen. Within two hours, these flies had dispersed. At this time, we could only find about a dozen or so in the entire area. On the way back, we stopped every ten miles to look for the same insects. There were none. Tonight, I gave the samples to a bacteriologist. The entomologist immediately identified these insects as "stoneflies." These stoneflies and leaves are being examined for infectious viruses. I have now joined the great army of witnesses to bacteriological warfare. The evidence is undeniable. In the clear blue sky, leaves fell from high altitude. Flies appeared suddenly at the same time, and then dispersed. They were dropped from the plane and could not have come from anywhere else.

    目击美国侵略军飞机撒布毒虫毒物情形
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】本社在朝鲜前线采访的记者中，已有两人亲眼目睹美国侵略军飞机撒布毒虫和毒物的情形。美国飞机的这两次罪行都是在光天化日之下明目张胆地进行的；过去，它们常常是在黑夜或多云雾的阴天偷着干的。
    在中部前线采访的本社记者戴煌报道：三月二十三日夜间，我乘车沿着淮阳到平康的公路到前线去。这一夜风雪交加，气候变得异常寒冷，我和汽车司机就在洗浦里住歇下来。第二天天气转晴，蓝色的晴空中仅有几片白色的浮云。上午九时许，忽然听到飞机的马达声由远而近，我立即从住室跑到外面去，并隐蔽起来观察。我见到一架双引擎的美国飞机由东南向西北飞来，高度约在两千公尺左右。该机飞到洗浦里西北五里左右的上空时，即转向正北，接着又折向正东。当它刚要转向东南方向时，该机机尾即喷出雾状的东西，每隔三秒钟喷一次，连喷三次。这些雾状的东西在空中被风吹散，慢慢飘落下来，到低空时可以分辨出是许多彩色的传单。我的眼睛继续注视着敌机，接着看见转回来的飞机又从机尾喷出了一团黄色雾状物，连喷两次，以后该机即向东南飞去。不一忽儿，敌机喷出的雾状物就在空中消散了。人们朝着敌机喷出雾状物的方向跑去寻找，就在洗浦里西北约三里路的一个高地上发现了敌机撒下的细菌毒虫。我见到，这个积雪的无名高地的山梁上，南北约一百公尺，东西约七十公尺的面积内遍布土黄色毛虫和苍蝇，最密处每平方公尺内约有三百多个。这些毒虫为当地政府和人民迅速扑灭。
    在西部前线采访的本社记者阎吾报道：四月二日上午十一时四十分，我随细菌学专家魏曦教授等正在某地调查美国侵略者细菌战罪行时，忽然有几架飞机飞到这一地区的上空。飞机飞得很高，不容易看清。这几架飞机在高空盘旋了约二十分钟以后就开始喷出一团团的东西来，接着就在晴空中散成无数斑点。这些敌机喷射出的东西落近地面时，我们就看出是褐黄色的柞树叶。当一片片的柞树叶向地面飘落时，魏曦教授连忙兜开工作服接着几张。接着美国飞机又撒下了许多带翅飞虫，我们身上都落到了这些虫子。敌机因为害怕地面高射炮火把它击落下来，始终不敢低飞，只是在高空嗡嗡作响。敌机飞走后，当地的部队和居民立即赶来一道将毒虫和毒物扑灭。魏曦教授是我国抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队副队长，又是“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”团员。他来到朝鲜前线以后，即到处奔跑，紧张地进行调查和检验工作；这一次他又和我亲眼看到了美国飞机撒布带细菌的毒虫毒物的情形，并亲手收集了美国侵略者细菌战的罪证。他告诉记者说，他已成为一个控诉美帝国主义细菌战罪行的有力见证人。
    【新华社七日讯】英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿自朝鲜某地防疫委员会总部报道：二日，我亲眼看见一次美国细菌空袭。这是美国人正在进行细菌战的绝对确凿的证明。我正驾驶着一辆吉普车穿过一个偏僻山区到一个曾遭到细菌空袭的地点去。路上，我们在一个宽阔的山谷中停下来吃东西。一架飞机由头上飞过去，高得叫我们难以看见。约二十分钟以后，我发现一些小点子从很高的天空中飘下来。我们注视着它们，在它们落得较低的时候，我们可以看出它们是褐色的树叶子——有几百片。我们在空中抓到一些。突然，天空中也到处出现长翅膀的、鼓翼乱飞的昆虫，其中许多落在我们身上。在几分钟内，我们就用筷子捉到几十只。这时，只有很轻微的风——小得不能把树叶子由附近的山上吹跑。但是，为了稳妥起见，我们由附近的各种树叶子中挑了一些样品。这些树叶都是别一种样子，并且是经过风吹雨打的，上面有泥土，而那些由天上掉下来的则是发光的、清洁的，虽然上面都有些菌类生长物。我迎着风走了约三百码，并没有看到苍蝇或树叶的踪迹。回到吉普车那里时，发现空中仍然到处都是苍蝇，这些东西下来的时候飞行力很强。我们不再继续行路，在那里等着看一看会发生什么情况，两小时之内，这些苍蝇都飞散了。这时，我们在整个地区内只能找到一打左右。在回来的路上，我们每走十英里便停下来，找一找有没有同样的昆虫。没有。今天晚上，我把样子交给细菌学家。昆虫学家立即辨认出这些昆虫是“石蝇”。这些石蝇和树叶正在加以检查，看有没有传染病毒。这些苍蝇是水生的。现在我已经参加了细菌战见证人的大军。证据是否认不了的。在清朗的蓝色天空中，树叶自高空落下。苍蝇同时突然出现，然后又散开了。它们是由飞机上掉下来的，不可能由其他任何地方来的。
