Long Live the Working People of Our Great Motherland
Li Xuesan, Head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation

Our Volunteer Army Returning Delegation has been back in the motherland for over three months. In this short period, wherever we have gone, we have personally witnessed the working people of our motherland, all in a fighting and tense posture, warmly responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," and the wealth of the motherland is growing substantially.

The worker brothers, under the slogan of "taking the factory as the battlefield and the machine as the weapon," are working day and night, launching a production increase campaign, and their labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Rationalization proposals have improved production management and enhanced production technology. New inventions and new productivity records are constantly emerging. The working class is contributing all its wisdom and talents to the motherland. The Hao Jianxiu work method is being implemented throughout the country. The leather roller lint of some yarn factories in Qingdao has been reduced to 0.25 pounds per hundred, and the construction of a passenger car in the Sifang Railway Factory has been reduced from 400 workdays to 200 workdays. The Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant had as many as 111 rationalization proposals from January to March, and the cylinder yield rate increased from 50 percent to 80 percent. Kong Xianzong, a labor model of the Guangzhou Copper Refinery, painstakingly studied the manufacturing method of stainless copper, and its quality is better than that of foreign products. Wang Shengbao, a labor model of the Xicun Power Plant, successfully repaired the turbine that foreign technical engineers considered irreparable… These model deeds are endless. The working class of the motherland is actively increasing production and practicing thrift with the attitude of being the masters of the house. Their glorious deeds are the model for the people of the motherland.

The patriotic bumper harvest competition among the farmer brothers is equally enthusiastic. The nationally famous agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Geng Changsuo mutual aid groups have challenged the national mutual aid groups to a competition, and many farmers have responded. We personally visited and toured the twenty-five mutual aid joint groups of Pu Zhongzhi, a labor model in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County. Their branch led well, rationally used labor, animal power, and farm implements, thereby improving labor efficiency. They promoted democracy and studied and improved production technology, thus increasing the yield per unit area (474 jin per mu). Their production plan is specific and detailed, so they are very confident in completing the 1952 target of an average yield of 625 jin per mu for the whole village. They are boldly purchasing new farm implements, such as Liberation-style waterwheels, new-style walking plows, weeding machines, rice threshers, sprayers, etc. They are stepping up the work of repairing ten canals, digging forty-eight wells, and planting eight thousand trees. They do not relax various sideline activities. They have supply and marketing cooperatives. Their production path, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, is the only way for farmers to go from poverty to prosperity, and it is the way for farmers to get rid of poverty and seek liberation forever. At the same time, we saw many model figures who improved the yield per unit area. Lin Yancheng, an agricultural production labor model in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, created a record of 1,622 jin of rice per mu in double-cropping rice fields. Chen Yongkang, an agricultural labor model in Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu, created a record of 1,433 jin per mu in single-cropping rice fields. Shi Anfu, a labor model in Hancheng, Shaanxi Province, created a record of 810 jin of wheat per mu. They created new records for agricultural bumper harvests in our country, and were therefore rewarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for patriotic bumper harvests in 1951. Their brilliant achievements have become a clear banner for the vast number of farmers to increase production, and have also pointed out the bright future for the further development of agricultural production in New China.

Of course, the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift is not limited to workers and farmers, but the people of the whole country are working together to increase production, improve work, and practice thrift to support our Volunteer Army and prepare for large-scale economic construction.

Our Volunteer Army Returning Delegation will celebrate this May Day holiday for all the workers of the world in our great and magnificent capital. We will personally see the strong lineup of the workers of our motherland, and we will also hear the magnificent cheers of the workers of our motherland. We feel infinitely honored and excited to have such a rare opportunity. On the occasion of commemorating the "May Day" Labor Day, I want to shout: "Long live our great working people!"

    伟大祖国的劳动人民万岁
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长  李雪三
    我们志愿军归国代表团，回到祖国来，已经是三个多月了，在这短短的时间里，所到之处，亲眼看到了祖国的劳动人民，都是以战斗的紧张姿态，热烈地响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，祖国的财富正在大量地增长着。
    工人兄弟们，在“把工厂做战场，机器当武器”的口号下，昼夜不停地工作着，展开了增产竞赛运动，劳动热忱空前地提高了；合理化的建议，改善了生产管理与提高了生产技术；新的创造发明，生产率新纪录不断地涌现了出来。工人阶级把所有的智慧与才能贡献给祖国。郝建秀的工作方法，在全国各地施行着，青岛某些纱厂的皮辊花已降到百分之零点二五磅，四方铁路工厂造一个客车，由四百个工降到二百个工，天津汽车制配厂一月至三月份合理化的建议达一百十一件之多，汽缸成品率由百分之五十上升到百分之八十。广州炼铜厂劳动模范孔宪忠，苦心研究了不锈铜的制造法，质量较之外国货为好，西村发电厂劳动模范王生保，将外国技术工程人员认为无法修理的透平机，修理成功了…这些模范事迹是说不完写不尽的，祖国的工人阶级，都是以当家做主人的态度来积极进行增产节约的。他们的光辉事迹，是祖国人民的楷模。
    农民兄弟们的爱国丰产竞赛运动，同样是热烈的。全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达、耿长锁互助组向全国互助组的竞赛挑战，已经有很多农民应战了，我们亲自访问了并参观了长安县模范村王蟒村劳动模范蒲忠智的二十五个互助联组，他们的支部领导得好，合理地使用劳力、牲畜力、农具，因而提高了劳动效率。他们发扬了民主，研究改进生产技术，因此提高了单位面积产量（每亩四百七十四斤）。他们生产计划定得具体详细，因而他们很有信心完成一九五二年全村每亩平均六百二十五斤的产量。他们正大胆地购买新式农具，如解放式水车、新式步犁、锄草机、打稻机、喷雾机等，他们正加紧修十条水渠，打四十八眼水井，植树八千株的工作。他们还不放松各种副业工作，他们办有供销合作社，他们的生产道路，正如毛主席所指出的，是农民为了由贫困走向富裕的必由之路，是农民永远摆脱穷困求得解放之路。同时我们看到许多提高单位面积产量的模范人物，广东省揭阳县农业生产劳动模范林炎城双季稻田，创造了每亩水稻出产一千六百二十二斤的纪录，苏南淞江县，农业劳动模范陈永康单季稻田创造了每亩一千四百三十三斤的纪录，陕西省韩城劳动模范史安福，创造每亩产小麦八百一十斤的纪录，他们创造我国农业丰产的新纪录，因此也受到中央人民政府农业部，一九五一年度爱国丰产的奖励。他们的光辉成就，成为广大农民提高产量的鲜明旗帜，也指出了新中国农业生产进一步发展的光明前途。
    当然，爱国增产节约运动，还不只限于工人，农民的事，而是全祖国的人民，都在一齐为增加生产，提高工作，厉行节约，来支持我们志愿军和准备大规模经济建设而努力着。
    我们志愿军归国代表团，将要在我们伟大而壮丽的首都来欢渡这全世界劳动者的五一节日了，我们将要亲眼看到我们祖国劳动者的强大阵容，也将要听到祖国劳动者雄壮的欢呼声音，有这样难得的机会，我们感到有无尚的光荣和兴奋。值此纪念“五一”劳动节日的时候，我要高呼：“我们伟大的劳动人民万岁！”
    四月二十九日
