Cultural Briefs

    ▲ Chongqing City has conducted propaganda against the United States' germ warfare among the broad masses. Party propagandists all regard the propaganda against American germ warfare as a serious political struggle. Under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, they have begun to go deep into the masses to carry out their work. More than 800 blackboard newspapers in the urban area of Chongqing have been put to use. The Chongqing Municipal People's Cultural Center has uniformly issued manuscripts to expose the hideous face of American imperialism. In conjunction with the recent screening of the Soviet film "The Return of Life," they called on people from all walks of life to learn from the Russian health worker Pirogov's noble patriotism for the motherland and the people. In order to better educate the masses, the blackboard newspaper of the Fourth Mutual Aid Team of Side Village, Guanyin Rock, also drew colored cartoons on the blackboard newspaper, and wrote important words and sentences with colored chalk. The blackboard newspaper of Section 2 of Luomadian also published the reactions of the masses. Peng Aizhen, a resident of Section 1 of Dayanggou, in her letter, in addition to condemning the crime of the United States in conducting germ warfare, also expressed her attitude, pointing out that bacteriological weapons are not terrible, and the people have enough power to deal with them.

    ▲重庆市在广大群众中进行了反对美国进行细菌战的宣传。党的宣传员都把宣传反对美国进行细菌战作为一个严重的政治斗争来看待，在中国共产党重庆市委员会的领导下，已开始深入群众进行工作。重庆市城区的八百余块黑板报已被一齐运用起来，由市人民文化馆统一发稿，以揭露美帝国主义狰狞的面目，并结合最近上映的苏联电影“起死回生”，号召各界人民学习俄国卫生工作者彼洛果夫为祖国、为人民的崇高的爱国主义精神。观音岩四德村第四互助组的黑板报为了更好地教育群众，还在黑板报上画了彩色的漫画，并对重要的词句，用彩色的粉笔写出来。骡马店二段的黑板报上还发表了群众的反应，大阳沟一段居民彭爱珍在来信中，除了声讨美国进行细菌战的罪行外，还表示了自己的态度，指出细菌武器并不可怕，人民有足够的力量来对付它。
