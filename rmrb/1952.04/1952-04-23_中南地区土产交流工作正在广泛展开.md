The exchange of native produce in the Central South region has been unfolding. State-owned trading departments, cooperatives, and some private merchants throughout the region have basically been able to meet the demands of farmers for bulk agricultural products such as flue-cured tobacco, cane sugar, ramie, timber, tung oil, and cotton. Smaller-scale mountain goods and native products such as straw hat braids, umbrellas, palm fiber, handmade paper, and medicinal materials have become more readily marketable. State-owned trading departments are also working to develop sales channels for temporarily slow-moving goods like homespun cloth, domestically produced tobacco, live pigs, and fresh eggs. Currently, state-owned trade workers, cooperative workers, and native produce distributors in the Central South region are seizing the farming season to continue expanding the scope of native produce exchange. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has stipulated that state-owned trading departments throughout the Central South region must purchase a total value of one trillion yuan in native produce during the second quarter. The Central South Region Native Produce Exchange Conference also began in Hankou on April 16th.

This spring, the native produce exchange work in the Central South region has drawn on last year's experience. On the one hand, various localities have paid attention to sales in distant areas, and on the other hand, they have also organized short-distance exchanges. The Trade Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee specifically established a Native Produce Exchange Office in early April to guide material exchange throughout the region. Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces have successively sent cadres to East China, North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China to restore relationships and promote the sale of native products. Luoyang, Shanzhou, Xinyang, Shangqiu and other areas in Henan Province have held small-scale native produce exchange conferences by special district. The exchange conference in Luoyang Special District alone saw transactions worth 1.1 billion yuan in three days. State-owned trading units in Luoyang and Nanyang also took advantage of temple fairs to promote the sale of slow-moving vermicelli, noodles, and fertilizers. Due to the early organization of long- and short-distance native produce exchanges, the Hunan Provincial Trading Company's sales of native produce in March increased by 161 percent compared to February, and Henan Province's sales of native produce in March increased by 60 percent compared to February.

Cooperatives in the Central South region are also taking the purchase and sale of native produce as one of their current central tasks, and are using methods such as exchanging fertilizer for native produce to support agricultural production. The Cooperative Affairs Administration Bureau of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee held a regional business meeting at the end of March, at which it was initially determined to sign 22 sales contracts with a total transaction value of more than 60 billion yuan. In order to help cooperatives accelerate capital turnover, state-owned trading departments in the Central South region have decided to take over all the bulk native produce already purchased by the cooperative system in April.

Native produce distributors in various regions have also begun to purchase and sell native produce in production areas both inside and outside the region. The Zhengzhou Medicinal Materials Mule and Horse Fair, which opened on April 9, had 1,658 participating entities from 38 public and private sectors, an increase of 331 entities compared to last year's fair. Private pharmacies and medicinal materials shops in Zhengzhou sent more than 2,600 letters to merchants in various regions before the fair, inviting them to participate in transactions.

After the "Three-Anti" movement, the management work of state-owned trading departments in various regions began to improve. For example, gypsum transported by the Hunan Provincial Trading Company to Zhejiang last year was not sold for a year because it missed the season; this year, it contacted sales areas such as Fujian as early as before the spring plowing, and thus sold a large amount of gypsum. Tung oil is one of the major native products of farmers in Hunan. In order to expand the sales of tung oil, the provincial trading company recently concluded a batch of tung oil transactions with the Xingtai area of Hebei Province. It accurately calculated the regional price differences and automatically reduced the selling price by 20,000 yuan per dan (the purchase price in the producing area remained unchanged). The price of Hunan's mineral products has also been reduced for transport and sale in Fujian. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中南地区土产交流工作正在广泛展开

    中南地区土产交流工作正在广泛展开
    中南地区土产交流已经展开。全区国营贸易部门、合作社和部分私商对大宗农产品如烤烟、蔗糖、苎麻、木材、桐油、棉花等的收购，已基本上能满足农民的要求。小宗山货土产如草帽辫、雨伞、棕片、土纸、药材等已经转趋畅销。暂时滞销的土布、土烟、生猪、鲜蛋等也正由国营贸易部门开拓销路。现在，中南区国营贸易工作者、合作社工作者和土产运销商正抓紧农时，继续扩大土产交流范围。中南军政委员会财政经济委员会已规定中南全区国营贸易部门要在第二季度收购土产总值一万亿元。中南区土产交流会议也已在四月十六日起在汉口举行。
    今春中南区土产交流工作吸取了去年的经验，各地一方面注意到远地推销，同时也组织了近距离交流。中南军政委员会贸易部特地在四月上旬成立土产交流办公室，指导全区物资交流。湖南、河南、江西三省先后派出干部到华东、华北、西北、东北等地区恢复关系，推销土产。河南洛阳、陕州、信阳、商邱等地以专区为单位召开了小型土产交流会议，仅洛阳专区的交流会，三天就成交十一亿元。洛阳、南阳两地的国营贸易单位赶庙会，也推销了很多滞销的粉条、粉面和肥料。由于及早组织远近距离土产交流，湖南省贸易公司三月份推销土产比二月份增加百分之一百六十一，河南省三月份销出的土产比二月份增加百分之六十。
    中南地区的合作社也以购销土产为当前中心工作之一，并用以肥料换购土产的办法，支持农业生产。中南军政委员会合作事业管理局曾在三月底召开全区业务会议，会上初步确定订立推销合同二十二件，交易总值为六百多亿元。为了帮助合作社加速资金周转，中南国营贸易部门决定在四月份内把合作社系统已收购的大宗土产全部收下。
    各地的土产运销商也已开始到区内外产地购销土产。四月九日开幕的郑州药材骡马大会，有公私单位三十八个行业一千六百五十八户到会交易，比去年的药材骡马大会增加了三百三十一户。郑州市私营药行、药栈在会前向各地客商发了二千六百多封信，邀请他们到会交易。
    各地国营贸易部门经过“三反”运动后，经营工作开始改进。如湖南省贸易公司去年运往浙江的石膏因误了季节，一年没有销出；今年早在春耕之前就和福建等销地联系，因而销售了大批石膏。桐油是湖南农民大宗土产之一，为了扩大桐油销路，该省贸易公司最近和河北省邢台地区成交一批桐油时，精确地计算了地区差价，自动将每担销价降低两万元（产地收购价未变）。湖南的矿磺也降低了
