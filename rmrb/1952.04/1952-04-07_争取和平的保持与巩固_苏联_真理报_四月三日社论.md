To defend and consolidate the great cause of peace and to ensure the security of all peoples is the lofty goal which hundreds of millions of good people around the world are striving to achieve by uniting and solidifying their ranks.

The determination of peace-loving people of all nations to defend the cause of peace and to thwart the aggressive plans of the warmongers was newly expressed in the resolutions adopted yesterday by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at its meeting held in Oslo from March 29th to April 1st.

The meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council took place against the background of the intensified preparations by the American-British aggressive bloc for a new world war. The American and British imperialists are frantically expanding their armaments, maintaining and deepening the division of Germany, doing everything possible to prevent German unification, and, against the will of the majority of the German and Japanese people, rearming West Germany and Japan. The aspirations of the people of the colonies and dependent countries for freedom and independence are being brutally suppressed.

Under these circumstances, all peace-loving nations must wage a more active, organized, and persistent struggle against the threat of war. The significance of the resolutions adopted by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council lies first and foremost in the fact that these resolutions put forward a broad program for peace defenders to conduct the struggle for maintaining and consolidating world peace.

The general resolution of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council points out that public opinion is increasingly advocating the peaceful settlement of postwar issues through negotiations among the great powers. The fact that 603,570,000 people signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers clearly proves this. This number is 122 million more than the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

However, the achievements already made should not give rise to complacency in the ranks of peace fighters. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council calls for further strengthening the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact and for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. In order to more broadly unite all the peace-loving forces of the people, the Executive Bureau resolved to convene a meeting of the World Peace Council in June, and at the meeting, it will propose convening a Congress for the Defense of Peace this year.

The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council paid special attention to the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and China. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, made a report at the meeting on the crimes of the United States in conducting bacteriological warfare. In this report, as well as in the speech by Li Kiyong, the representative of the Korean Peace Committee, many facts were cited to expose that the American imperialists used bacteriological weapons, prohibited by international conventions, against the peace-loving people of Korea and Northeast China.

Guo Moruo pointed out: "The monstrous crimes of the U.S. government are a great threat to human security and world peace. It violates human morality and destroys all international conventions."

The fact that the American imperialists have even used weapons that the Hitlerite murderers dared not use has aroused the indignation of all honest people around the world. The people of all countries denounce the crimes of the American interventionists and demand severe punishment for the masterminds who launched bacteriological warfare.

The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council issued a special appeal "Against Bacteriological Warfare." The appeal states: "After carefully studying the documents relating to the ongoing bacteriological warfare in China and Korea, we are deeply anxious and shocked. Bacteriological warfare is not only a heinous crime that should be stopped, but also a threat to all mankind. We appeal to the conscience of men and women around the world, calling on them to demand the cessation of bacteriological warfare and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons."

The Executive Bureau called on the people of the world to exert pressure on their governments so that all countries, without exception, sign, ratify, and abide by the 1925 international convention prohibiting the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons. As is well known, the U.S. government has refused to ratify this convention. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, representing all peace-loving people, demands that those criminals who use the most despicable, vile, and horrific weapons be brought to justice as war criminals.

The resolutions of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, reflecting the will and aspirations of hundreds of millions of people, will undoubtedly arouse a wide response in all countries and help to further develop and consolidate the great movement of the people of all countries to defend peace.

The peace defenders of all countries and all progressive mankind greeted with exceptional satisfaction the replies given yesterday by Comrade Stalin to questions posed by a group of editors of American newspapers.

The editors of the American newspapers asked: "Is a third world war closer now than it was two or three years ago?" Comrade Stalin replied: "No, it is not." To the question, "Would a meeting of the heads of the Great Powers be useful?" Comrade Stalin replied: "It might be useful." To the question, "Do you think that the present moment is suitable for the unification of Germany?" Comrade Stalin stated: "Yes, I do." A group of American newspaper editors asked: "On what basis is the coexistence of capitalism and communism possible?" Comrade Stalin wrote: "The peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is quite possible provided there is a mutual desire to cooperate, readiness to carry out obligations assumed, and observance of the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states."

Stalin's replies are a new proof of the consistent peace-loving policy of the Soviet government. This policy aims at strengthening relations with all countries and achieving peaceful international cooperation. In this document, millions of people obtained detailed answers to questions that agitate all nations. Comrade Stalin's replies strengthen the confidence of the broad masses of the people in the possibility of defending the cause of peace and encourage millions of peace defenders to wage a more resolute struggle against the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers.

The will of the peace-loving people to defend peace is firm and unyielding. The people of all nations, who have tasted the consequences of the imperialist policies of war, hunger, and poverty, are increasingly aware of their strength and the possibility of participating in the struggle for the great cause of peace. The peace defenders understand that only the resolute and organized action of the peace-loving people can shatter the sinister plans of the imperialists and defend and consolidate the cause of peace.

Comrade Stalin once instructed: "Peace can be maintained and consolidated if the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end."

Our powerful socialist motherland, faithful to the peace-loving foreign policy of Stalin, stands at the forefront of the struggle for peace. The Soviet people are infinitely loyal to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin, the cause of communism. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, under the leadership of the leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, they are selflessly working to consolidate the power of our motherland – the bastion of world peace – and are actively fighting for the consolidation of lasting peace and the friendship of all nations.

    争取和平的保持与巩固
    苏联“真理报”四月三日社论
    保卫与巩固伟大的和平事业，保障各族人民的安全，这是全世界各国亿万善良的人们联合起来并团结他们的队伍所要求达到的崇高目的。
    爱好和平的各族人民保卫和平事业、使战争贩子的侵略计划无法实现的决心，在由三月二十九日至四月一日在奥斯陆开会的世界和平理事会执行局昨天所发表的决议中，有了新的表示。
    世界和平理事会执行局会议，是在美英侵略集团加紧准备新的世界大战的情况下举行的。美英帝国主义者正在疯狂地扩张军备，保持并加深德国的分裂，千方百计阻止德国的统一，并且违背德国和日本大多数人民的意志，进行武装西德和日本。殖民地和附属国人民对自由和独立的渴望，正受到残暴的镇压。
    在这种情况下，各爱好和平的民族必须进行更加积极的、有组织的和坚持的斗争以反对战争威胁。世界和平理事会执行局所通过的各项决议，其意义首先在于这些决议为和平保卫者提出了进行维护和巩固世界和平斗争的广泛纲领。
    在世界和平理事会执行局的总决议中指出：舆论已愈来愈坚决主张用大国谈判的方式来和平解决战后各项问题。六亿零三百五十七万人签名于世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言，这一事实明显地证明了这一点。这个数字比在关于禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数多一亿二千二百万。
    但是，已经达到的成就不应该在和平战士的队伍中引起自满情绪。世界和平理事会执行局号召进一步加强争取缔结和平公约、争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的运动。为了更广泛地团结一切人民的爱好和平的力量，执行局决议在六月间召开世界和平理事会会议，并在会上提出在今年召开保卫和平大会的建议。
    世界和平理事会执行局对美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题，给予了特别的注意。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若，在会上做了关于美国进行细菌战罪行的报告。在这个报告以及在朝鲜拥护和平委员会代表李箕永的发言中，曾列举了许多事实，揭露美帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国东北爱好和平的人民使用了为国际公约所禁止的细菌武器。
    郭沫若指出：“美国政府的滔天罪行是人类安全和世界和平的极大威胁。它违反了人类道义，破坏了一切国际公约。”
    美帝国主义者竟然使用了连希特勒杀人凶犯也不敢使用的武器，这种罪恶已经激起了全世界正直人民的忿怒。各国人民痛斥美国干涉者的罪行，并要求严惩发动细菌战的元凶。
    世界和平理事会执行局发出了“反对细菌战”的特别号召。号召中说：“我们仔细地研讨了有关目前在中国和朝鲜进行的细菌战的文件以后，深感焦虑和震惊。细菌战不仅是应该予以制止的丑恶罪行，而且是对全人类的威胁。我们向全世界男女的良心呼吁，号召他们要求制止细菌战和禁止细菌武器。”
    执行局号召全世界人民对本国政府施以压力，以使所有国家都毫无例外地签署、批准并遵守一九二五年关于禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的国际公约。如所周知，美国政府曾拒绝批准这一公约。世界和平理事会执行局代表全体爱好和平的人民，要求把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。
    世界和平理事会执行局的决议，反映出亿万人民的意志和愿望，无疑的，它们会在各国引起广泛反应，并有助于各国人民保卫和平的伟大运动的进一步发展和巩固。
    各国的和平保卫者和全体进步人类异常满意地迎接了昨天公布的斯大林同志对一批美国报纸编辑所提问题的答复。
    美国报纸的编辑们问：“第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？”斯大林同志回答说：“不，不是这样。”对于“各大国首脑举行一次会谈有益处吗？”这个问题，斯大林同志回答说：“可能会有益处。”对于“你认为现在是统一德国的适当时机吗？”这个问题，斯大林同志表示：“是的，我认为是这样。”一批美国报纸编辑问：“在什么基础上资本主义与共产主义的共存才是可能的？”斯大林同志写道：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”
    斯大林的答复，是苏联政府一贯的爱好和平的政策的新证明。这个政策旨在加强与所有各国之间的关系，获致国际间的和平合作。对于激动各族人民的问题，千百万人在这个文件中获得详尽的答复。斯大林同志的答复，加强着广大人民群众对保卫和平事业的可能性的信心，鼓舞着千百万和平保卫者对帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋进行更坚决的斗争。
    爱好和平的人民保卫和平的意志是坚强不屈的。饱尝帝国主义的战争、饥饿和贫困政策后果的各族人民，愈来愈明了自己的力量和参与争取伟大和平事业斗争的可能性。和平保卫者们懂得，只有爱好和平的人民坚决的有组织的行动，才能粉碎帝国主义者的罪恶计划，才能保卫和巩固和平事业。
    斯大林同志曾指示说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    我们强大的社会主义祖国，忠实于爱好和平的斯大林的对外政策，站在争取和平斗争的最前列。苏联人民无限忠诚于列宁—斯大林的伟大事业、共产主义事业，他们在布尔什维克党、在领袖和导师斯大林同志的领导下，忘我地为巩固我们祖国——世界和平堡垒——的威力而劳动着，积极地为争取巩固持久的和平与各族人民的友好而斗争着。
