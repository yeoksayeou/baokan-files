Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been released nationwide starting from the 10th. The total national print run of the second volume is 1.5 million copies, uniformly distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, with wholesale from Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun: 500,000 copies in Beijing, 800,000 copies in Shanghai, and 200,000 copies in Changchun, including 10,000 hardcover copies in Beijing.

Staff at Xinhua Bookstores across the country believe that engaging in the distribution of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the most glorious political task. Xinhua Bookstore's general and branch stores have established "'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' Distribution Groups," led by the managers, to oversee distribution and arrange window displays. When the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was released, many medium and small cities could not be sold on the same day as major cities due to inconvenient transportation. This time, thanks to good transportation work, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II can be sold nationwide on the same day. To ensure that bookstores across the country could simultaneously release "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II on April 10th, Xinhua Bookstores in Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun, responsible for wholesale, and Xinhua Bookstores at various transit points, conducted thorough investigations into traffic conditions and transportation tools in advance and started the transportation of the book in early March. The East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore organized a shipping group of seventeen people stationed at the East China Xinhua Printing Factory to directly ship the book from the factory to various locations. Seeing that the book had many pages and a thick spine, and that the wrapping paper was easily broken by vibration, the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore General Store devised a method of using "corrugated cardboard boxes" to pack the parcels to prevent the books from being damaged.

The post office, railways, shipping and other departments also gave great help to the distribution of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, granting the book the right of priority loading and transportation, and doing everything possible to ensure the safety and speed of transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: People in Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Dihua and other places are competing to purchase the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

When the Tianjin Xinhua Bookstore branch had not yet opened for business on the morning of the 10th, the door was already crowded with people waiting to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II. By 7 pm that day, five major bookstores in Tianjin had sold more than 2,900 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II.

Shenyang City sold 9,089 copies in two days. These two days, many people gathered in front of the Xinhua Bookstore early every morning. For a long time, people have been looking forward to the publication of the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." An old man, Ren, was afraid that he would forget to buy the book, so he wrote on the envelope containing the purchase certificate: "Most Important Item, 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' Purchase Certificate, read the newspaper every day." On the 10th, Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, also went to the bookstore to give instructions on the distribution work.

In the southwest region, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Ya'an, Luxian, Nanchong and other cities and counties began to distribute the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on the 10th, and the masses competed to purchase it.

In Xi'an City, it rained all day on the 10th, and many workers, students, citizens, and cadres from government agencies queued in the rain in front of the Xinhua Bookstore, waiting to buy it. Many people in Xi'an City who had not bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" before registered to pre-order again, and the number of registered people has reached more than 3,500 in the past ten days.

While distributing the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the Dihua Xinhua Bookstore began to distribute six single-volume editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Uyghur, and four single-volume editions in Kazakh, translated and published by the Xinjiang People's Publishing House. In four hours on the morning of the 10th, Dihua City sold 1,820 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, 5,500 copies of the Uyghur version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and 480 copies of the Kazakh version. Cadets of various ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, and Russian, from the Political Training Class of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, lined up to the Xinhua Bookstore and purchased 2,320 copies of the Uyghur and Kazakh versions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at one time.

In addition, people in Nanjing, Wuhan and other places have also flocked to various bookstores to purchase "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II.

    各地新华书店的工作人员都认为从事“毛泽东选集”的发行工作，是一项最光荣的政治任务。新华书店各总分店和分、支店都成立了“‘毛泽东选集’发行小组”，由经理任组长，领导发行、布置橱窗等工作。“毛泽东选集”第一卷发行时，许多中、小城市由于交通不方便未能和各大城市同日发售；这次因为运输工作做得好，全国各地都能在同日发售“毛泽东选集”第二卷。为了保证全国各地书店能在四月十日同时发售“毛泽东选集”第二卷，北京、上海、长春三地负责批发的新华书店和各转运地点的新华书店都在事先对交通情况和运输工具作了充分的调查，从三月初旬就开始了本书的运输工作。新华书店华东总分店组织了包括十七个人的发货小组驻在华东新华印刷厂，把本书从厂里直接发往各地。北京新华书店总店看到本书篇幅多、书脊厚，包封纸经振动容易破裂，就想办法采用“瓦棱纸匣”打邮包，使书本不受损坏。
    邮局、铁路、航运等部门对“毛泽东选集”第二卷的发行工作也给以很大的帮助，它们给本书以优先装运的权利，尽可能做到运输的安全和迅速。

    沈阳市两天内就售出了 九千零八十九册。这两天，每天一早就有很多人簇拥在新华书店门前。很久以来，人们就盼望“毛泽东选集”第二卷的出版。一位任老大爷，怕自己忘了买书，在装着购书证的信封上写着：“最要件，‘毛泽东选集’购书证，每天要看报。”十日，中共中央东北局宣传部副部长刘芝明并曾到书店对发行工作作了指示。
    西南区的重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳、雅安、泸县、南充等市、县都在十日开始发行“毛泽东选集”第二卷，群众争相购买。
    西安市在十日竟日下雨，许多工人、学生、市民、机关干部冒雨在新华书店门前排着队，等候购买。西安市许多以前没有买到“毛泽东选集”的人又都登记预购，十天来登记的人数已达三千五百多人。
    迪化市新华书店在发行“毛泽东选集”第二卷的同时，开始发行新疆省人民出版社翻译出版的“毛泽东选集”维吾尔文版单行册六种，哈萨克文版单行册四种。迪化市在十日上午的四小时内即售出“毛泽东选集”第二卷一千八百二十册，“毛泽东选集”维吾尔文版单行册五千五百册，哈萨克文版单行册四百八十册。中国人民解放军新疆军区政治训练班的维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、俄罗斯各民族的学员列队到新华书店，一次就购买了“毛泽东选集”维文版和哈文版单行册二千三百二十册。
    此外，南京、武汉等地人民也纷纷到各书店购买“毛泽东选集”第二卷。
