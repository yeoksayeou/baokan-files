    The People's Government Helps Us Conquer the Ice Flood
    Yellow River Water Disaster in Suiyuan Will Be Transformed into Water Conservancy
    Comrade Editor: Thanks to the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of our Suiyuan Province, the spring ice flood has been safely overcome. During the most critical stage, farmers along the river monitored and defended day and night, and the people's artillery bombarded ice bridges and ice dams day and night. What makes us even happier is that Chairman Mao sent planes to do good things for us. Several large ice dams had formed between Baotou, Sarachi, and Tokto counties. Thanks to the bombing by airplanes and artillery, the ice dams were blown open in just one day. This great victory guaranteed the safety of the lives and property of 250,000 people on both sides of the river, and the timely sowing of 462,900 mu of cultivated land, laying a solid foundation for striving for a bumper harvest this year. During the rule of the reactionaries, the spring ice flood of the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province caused disasters every year. Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the people of Suiyuan Province, but they were never seen bombing ice dams. Since liberation, Chairman Mao has sent planes to Suiyuan twice, last year and this year, to bomb ice dams and do good things for us, and also led us to build the Huangyang Sluice. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, this great scourge of the Yellow River will be conquered by us. It will no longer carry away our cattle and sheep or flood our fields. We will make it flow obediently into our fields and bring us better prospects.
    We thank Chairman Mao, support the People's Government, resolutely respond to the call of the People's Government, and strive for a greater harvest this year.　Zhang Jinbo

    人民政府帮助我们战胜凌汛
    绥远境内黄河水害将变成水利
    编辑同志：我们绥远省的春季凌汛，由于全省党、政、军、民的努力，已经安然度过了。在最紧张的阶段，沿河的农民日夜监督防范，人民的炮兵日夜轰击冰桥、冰坝。更使我们喜欢的是，毛主席派飞机给我们办了好事。包头、萨拉齐、托克托三县之间，曾结了几处大冰坝，由于飞机和大炮的轰击，只一天的工夫，冰坝就给轰开啦。这一伟大的胜利，保障了沿河两岸二十五万人民生命财产的安全，和四十六万二千九百亩耕地的及时播种，给今年争取农业丰收打下了稳固的基础。在反动派统治时，绥远省境内的黄河春季凌汛年年成灾，蒋介石的飞机炸死过绥远省的人民，却没有见他们来炸过冰坝。解放以来，毛主席在去年和今年已派过两次飞机来绥远炸冰坝，给我们办好事，还领导我们修黄羊闸。黄河这个大害，在毛主席的领导下，将要被我们征服了。它再不能卷走我们的牛羊，淹没我们的田园了。我们将使它驯顺地流到我们的地里，给我们带来更好的光景。
    我们感谢毛主席，拥护人民政府，坚决响应人民政府的号召，争取今年更大的丰收。　张金波
