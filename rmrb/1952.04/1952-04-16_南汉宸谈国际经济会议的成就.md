Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th – Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference, made the following statement after the conference closed:

    The International Economic Conference held in Moscow successfully closed on April 12th. This historically significant conference has achieved brilliant success.

    The reason for the success of this conference is that 471 industrialists, businessmen, economists, trade union workers, and cooperative workers from 49 countries with different social systems, although holding various ideological beliefs, shared a common belief in improving the lives of people in all countries through international economic cooperation. After a free exchange of views, the representatives of the participating countries unanimously agreed that the abnormal situation in current international economic relations urgently needs to be changed. The participants in the conference have sought ways to improve the living standards of people in all countries. This path is to abolish blockades and embargoes and to develop trade between countries as much as possible, especially trade between Eastern and Western countries. This international trade should be conducted on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The participants agreed that as long as international economic relations are established in accordance with such a path, the current man-made obstacles between countries will be shattered, which will greatly benefit the economic development of all countries and the improvement of people's living standards.

    It should be particularly pointed out that not only did the participants from various countries fully and freely exchange views on the issues to be discussed and reach a consensus, but also, during these short ten days, a large number of transactions were concluded and many trade agreements were signed between many countries. Up to now, the People's Republic of China has signed agreements with businessmen from Britain, France, Switzerland, and other countries for imports and exports totaling more than 160 million US dollars, and is continuing to hold talks with businessmen from various countries after the end of the conference. This fact powerfully illustrates that the conference is not for propaganda purposes, as some people have said. We want to take practical actions to promote international trade and the development of various other international economic relations. We not only want to do this now, but we will continue to do so in the future. The adoption of the establishment of a permanent body - the International Trade Promotion Committee - is the best proof. Therefore, we have full confidence that the abnormal international economic relations can be completely changed, and the development of international trade is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries.

    The conference is over, and our delegation from the People's Republic of China is about to return home. During our ten-plus days in Moscow, in addition to participating in the conference, we also visited many exhibitions, museums, factories, schools, etc., which made us more deeply appreciate the prosperity of the Soviet Union and the happiness of its people.

    We are especially grateful for the warm reception given to us by the Soviet Preparatory Committee and the people of Moscow. On behalf of all the members of the delegation, I would like to express our sincere respect to the Soviet Preparatory Committee and the Soviet people.

    南汉宸谈国际经济会议的成就
    各国代表一致认为应该取消封锁与禁运尽量发展国际贸易我与英法等国商业家签订进出口逾一亿六千万美元的协定
    【新华社莫斯科十五日电】我国出席国际经济会议代表团团长南汉宸，在会议闭幕后发表谈话如下：
    在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议已于四月十二日胜利闭幕了。这一个有历史意义的会议已经获得了辉煌的成就。
    这个会议之所以成功，是因为四十九个不同社会制度的国家的四百七十一位工商业者、经济学者、工会工作者、合作社工作者，虽然具有各种不同思想信仰，却对于通过国际经济合作以改善各国人民生活，都具有共同的信心。参加会议的各国代表在自由交换意见以后，一致认为目前国际经济关系的不正常情况急切需要改变。各国参加者在会议中，已经寻求了提高各国人民生活水准的道路，这条道路就是取消封锁禁运，尽量发展各国间的贸易，特别是东西方国家之间的贸易，这种国际贸易要在平等互利、尊重对方独立自主、不干涉对方主权的原则之下进行。与会者都认为只要遵照这样的道路去建立国际经济关系，那么世界各国间目前的人为的障碍必将被粉碎，对于各国经济的发展以及人民生活水准的提高均将大有裨益。
    特别应当指出的是：不仅各国与会者对于所要讨论的问题已经充分而自由地交换了意见并取得了一致的见解，而且在这短短的十天期间，很多国家间成交了大批交易，签订了很多贸易协定。截至目前为止，中华人民共和国已与英、法、瑞士等国家的商业家签订了进出口总额达一亿六千万美元以上的协定，并且在会议结束之后，还在与各国商业家继续会谈中。这一事实，有力地说明了会议并不像有些人所说的是为了宣传的目的。我们是要以实际行动来促进国际贸易以及其他各种国际经济关系的发展的。我们不仅现在要这样做，而且今后还要这样做，会议通过设立经常机构——国际贸易促进委员会一事，即是最好的证明。因此，我们有充分的信心。认为国际经济的不正常的关系是完全可以改变的，国际贸易的发展，是符合于各国人民的愿望的。
    会议结束了，我们中华人民共和国代表团即将返国。在莫斯科逗留十余日之中，我们除参加会议外，还参观了很多展览会、博物馆、工厂、学校等，使我们更深刻地体会到苏联国家的富强与人民生活的幸福。
    苏联筹备委员会和莫斯科人民对我们的热情招待，尤使我们衷心感激。我谨在此代表全体团员向苏联筹备委员会和苏联人民致以亲切的敬意。
