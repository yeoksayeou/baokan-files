Visiting Elina, Head of the Romanian Trade Union Delegation

    The reporter interviewed Stoia Elina, head of the Romanian Trade Union Delegation. She first told the reporter that she was very pleased to be able to come to New China as a representative of the Romanian Trade Union to participate in the "May Day" Labor Day ceremony. Because she can understand the struggle of the Chinese people in building a new life from actual contact when visiting great China.

    She said that when she arrived in Beijing, she was warmly welcomed by representatives of Chinese workers at the station, and she felt unspeakably happy and moved. She said: This friendship of the Chinese worker brothers proves the great unity of the working people of the world, and especially symbolizes the close unity and friendship between the Romanian and Chinese people.

    She especially stated that she felt warmth and love everywhere she went in New China. Not only was she warmly welcomed at the station, but she also received the same welcome when visiting various agencies and schools. She felt affectionately that celebrating "May Day" with Chinese brothers will be like being at home.

    When she talked about her visit to universities, middle schools, parks, nurseries and historical sites in the past few days, she said: In the university, from the daily life of professors and students, she realized that New China’s schools are closely related to Comrade Mao Zedong’s revolutionary work. She said that the delegation had visited Peking University, where Comrade Mao Zedong had worked, and realized that Chinese students have revolutionary traditions. They are with the working class and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, actively participated in the revolutionary movement against imperialism and for national independence.

    She said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have carried out a long and arduous struggle to win independence and freedom. Now this independence and freedom has been won; and in the short period of two or three years, the construction in all aspects has shown amazing achievements. For example, in the school field, a new education system based on advanced Soviet education has been seen. Under such a system, schools educate young students with Marxism-Leninism and internationalism. Judging from the comparison between the past and present lives of professors and students—whether it is school equipment or life care—it can be seen everywhere that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, especially Chairman Mao Zedong, care about people's education.

    She heartily appreciates the historical sites of Beijing, China. She said that no matter what purpose the feudal emperors and ruling classes had when they built them, these historical sites gloriously mark the wisdom and hard work of the Chinese working people. She said that from these beautiful scenery, it can be seen that the Chinese people's culture and art are not only long-standing but also advanced.

    He finally said that since the great Soviet Red Army liberated Romania, and with the continuous help of the Soviet Union, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the party and leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, are victoriously building a socialist country. The Romanian people have a five-year plan. The Party and the government have organized the labor of the people of the whole country, and have established and are establishing factories and canals, and more hydropower stations, sanatoriums, schools, workers' dormitories, and theaters are under construction.

    The five-year plan is being carried out enthusiastically. Through socialist labor emulation, the Stakhanov movement has become a mass movement, and new production records are constantly being created. The working people of Romania are consolidating the motherland and consolidating world peace in this way. The Romanian people, like other countries united in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, such as the great Chinese people, know how to defend peace.

    访问罗马尼亚工会代表团团长爱丽娜
    记者访问了罗马尼亚工会代表团团长斯托雅·爱丽娜。她首先对记者说：她能够作为罗马尼亚工会的代表，到新中国来参加“五一”劳动节的典礼，感到非常的愉快。因为她可以在访问伟大的中国时，从实际的接触中了解中国人民建设新生活的斗争情况。
    她说到北京时，在车站上受到中国工人的代表们的热烈欢迎，心里有说不出的高兴和感动。她说：中国工人兄弟这种情谊，证明了全世界劳动人民的大团结，特别是象征了罗中两国人民亲密团结的友谊。
    她特别表示：她到新中国来，处处感到温暖和友爱，不仅在车站上受到热烈的欢迎，在参观各机关、学校时也得到了同样的欢迎。她亲切地感到和中国兄弟在一块欢庆“五一”节，将像在自己家里一样。
    她谈到这几天参观大学、中学、公园、托儿所和历史古迹的情形时说：在大学里，从教授和学生的日常生活中，她认识到新中国的学校是和毛泽东同志的革命工作有着密切联系的。她说代表团已经参观过毛泽东同志曾在那里工作过的北京大学，体会到中国学生是有革命传统的，他们和工人阶级在一起，在中国共产党的领导下，积极的参加了反对帝国主义，争取祖国独立的革命运动。
    她说，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，进行了长期艰苦的斗争，以争取独立自由。现在这种独立自由已经争取到了；而且在短短的两三年当中，各方面的建设都显出了惊人的成就。譬如在学校方面，就看见了以苏联先进教育为基础的新的教育制度。在这样的制度下，学校是以马克思列宁主义和国际主义精神来教育青年学生的。从教授与学生过去和现在生活的对比来看——无论学校的设备和生活上的照顾——处处都可以看出中国共产党和人民政府，特别是毛泽东主席对人民教育的关心。
    她衷心地赞赏中国北京的历史古迹。她说不管当年封建帝王、统治阶级建造它们的时候有怎样的目的，这些历史古迹光辉地标志着中国劳动人民的智慧和辛勤劳动。她说从这些优美的风物上看出中国人民的文化艺术不但是历史悠久，而且是先进的。
    他最后说，自从伟大的苏联红军解放了罗马尼亚以后，又经过苏联不断的帮助，罗马尼亚的人民在党和领袖乔治·乌·德治的领导下，正在胜利地建设社会主义的国家。罗马尼亚人民有五年计划。党和政府把全国人民的劳动组织起来了，已经建立了和正在建立着工厂和运河，有更多的水电站、疗养所、学校、工人宿舍，和剧场在建设中。
    五年计划正在热烈地进行着，通过社会主义的劳动竞赛，斯达哈诺夫运动已成为群众性的运动，新的生产记录正不断地创造出来。罗马尼亚的劳动人民就是以这种方式来巩固祖国，巩固世界和平的。罗马尼亚人民正像其它团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中的各国人民，例如伟大的中国人民，是懂得怎样保卫和平的。    （萧凤）（附图片）
