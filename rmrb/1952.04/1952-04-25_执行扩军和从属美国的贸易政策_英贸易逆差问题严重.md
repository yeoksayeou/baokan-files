Implementing Military Expansion and a Trade Policy Subservient to the United States
Serious British Trade Deficit Problem

Xinhua News Agency, London, April 24th: The British government's recently proposed slogan, "We must produce more without increasing consumption," not only indicates that the living standards of the British people will be forcibly lowered, but also foreshadows a darker future for the British economy.

The "1952 Economic Outlook" released by the British government on the 22nd emphasizes that the production of armaments and export goods will continue to take priority. At the same time, to meet this need, domestic consumption and the production of consumer goods will be further reduced. The "Economic Outlook" forecasts that the production of domestic durable consumer goods such as automobiles, radios, and electrical appliances will be reduced by one-third. The supply of civilian cars will be reduced by nearly half compared to last year. Due to a reduction of 600 million pounds in imports, the supply of food this year will be further reduced. As a result of production cuts, unemployment will increase.

The "Economic Outlook" admits that the main causes of the current British crisis are the expansion of armaments and the subordination of British trade policy to the United States. The "Economic Outlook" states that Britain currently produces approximately half of the armaments produced in Western Europe. Nine percent of Britain's total labor force is now engaged in military work or armaments production. Further expansion will be needed in the future. The "Economic Outlook" also states that the trade deficit with the United States and Canada, which is closely linked to the United States in trade, is Britain's most difficult problem. The "Economic Outlook" avoids mentioning that the sharpening of the British trade deficit problem is a direct result of Britain's following the United States in restricting trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Therefore, it still regards reducing imports and increasing exports to the dollar area as the main solutions. However, in the current situation of a general trade crisis in the capitalist world, such efforts will obviously ultimately fail. Therefore, even the "Economic Outlook" admits that even if considerable success is achieved in sales to non-sterling areas, British exports are unlikely to increase significantly, because the trade restrictions successively implemented by various capitalist countries will inevitably reduce the sales of consumer goods.

When commenting on the British government's "Economic Outlook" for this year, the tone of the British bourgeois newspapers was particularly gloomy. The "Daily Mail" said: "The one really valuable thing the 'Economic Outlook' has done is to show once again that we are sadly close to disaster. We earn just enough to make a living, and until our savings increase enough to get us through the difficult days, danger will always be at our door." The "Yorkshire Post" also said: "What gives this statement a particularly unpleasant meaning is that it is quite possibly a reflection of a general reduction in the volume of (capitalist) world trade. This reduction is the most serious threat currently looming over our economy."

### 执行扩军和从属美国的贸易政策  英贸易逆差问题严重

    执行扩军和从属美国的贸易政策
    英贸易逆差问题严重
    【新华社二十四日讯】伦敦消息：英国政府最近提出的“我们必须更多生产而不增加消费”的口号，不但表明英国人民的生活水平将被强行压低，而且还预告英国经济的前途更加暗淡。
    英国政府二十二日发表的“一九五二年经济展望”强调，军火及出口货的生产将继续占优先地位，同时，为满足这项需要，国内消费及消费品生产将进一步削减。“经济展望”预告：英国国内耐用消费品如汽车、无线电、电气用具之类的生产将削减三分之一。民用汽车的供应将较去年减少将近
    一半。由于入口削减了六亿镑，今年食物的供给将进一步减少。生产削减的结果，失业将有增加。
    “经济展望”承认，英国目前危机主要的原因是扩充军备和将英国从属于美国的贸易政策。“经济展望”说：英国目前生产着西欧军火生产的大约一半。英国全部劳动人口的百分之九现在从事军事工作或军备生产。将来还需要进一步扩大。“经济展望”又说，对美国以及与美国在贸易上紧密结合的加拿大的贸易逆差是英国最困难的问题。“经济展望”避免提到英国贸易逆差问题的尖锐化是英国追随美国限制对苏联及人民民主国家贸易的直接结果。因此它仍然以削减入口及增加对美元区的出口为主要解决办法。但是在资本主义世界目前普遍发生贸易危机的情形之下，这种努力显然终归落空。所以连“经济展望”也承认：即使在对非英镑区的推销上获得颇大成就，英国的出口也不见得能大量增加，因为各资本主义国家先后实施的贸易限制势必使消费品销路缩小。
    英国资产阶级的报纸在评论英国政府今年的“经济展望”时，语调特别阴沉。“每日邮报”说：“‘经济展望’所做的一件真正有价值的事是它再一次显示了我们已可悲地靠近灾难。我们收入仅以糊口，在我们的积蓄增加到足以使我们度过艰难的日子以前，危险永远在我们门口。”“约克郡邮报”也说：“使这一声明具有特别令人不快的意义的是：它十分可能是反映了（资本主义）世界贸易量的普遍缩减。这种缩减是目前笼罩着我国经济的最严重的威胁。”
