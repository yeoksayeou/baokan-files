    The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, at its Oslo meeting, unanimously adopted a "Letter to All Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare," issuing a solemn and righteous condemnation of the U.S. aggressors' crime of germ warfare, and calling on all men and women of the world to wage a resolute struggle to stop the U.S. germ warfare crimes and demand the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. At the same time, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team published two documents, "Report on the Crimes of the United States in Korea" and "Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by U.S. Forces on Chinese Territory," presenting powerful evidence of the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare and other brutal crimes in China and Korea, and sternly condemning them. This undoubtedly makes the World Peace Council Executive Bureau's righteous denunciation of the U.S. aggressors for defending world peace and upholding human justice and security even more morally irresistible, and it will inevitably receive widespread response and support from all righteous humanity.
    The U.S. aggressors' frantic and outrageous crime of waging germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people is already well-documented and known to the world. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, the various democratic parties of China, Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, have all issued statements severely protesting and denouncing this insane crime of the U.S. aggressors. The "Investigation Team on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare" organized by the Chinese people and the investigation team sent by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers have both conducted on-the-spot investigations in the front and rear of Korea and in the Northeast region of China, collecting a large amount of evidence of the U.S. germ warfare. Based on this ironclad evidence, they have each issued investigation reports. These investigation reports all confirm with irrefutable facts that U.S. murderers did and are continuing to wage germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people; in addition to confirming the crime of U.S. germ warfare, the investigation report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team once again confirmed that the U.S. aggressors used chemical weapons in Korea, which are also prohibited by international law, and carried out massacres, murders, and other inhumane crimes against Korean peaceful residents. These well-documented reports have made an important contribution to the great struggle of all righteous humanity against germ warfare, leaving the U.S. murderers no room for denial.
    In order to enable peace-loving people of all countries to have a wider understanding of the truth, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council accepted the proposal of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against U.S. Aggression and decided to establish an international committee composed of the most prestigious representatives from the scientific, legal, and religious circles to continue to investigate the evidence of germ warfare. The establishment of this committee and its future work will inevitably receive the support and endorsement of peace-loving people all over the world.
    The heinous crimes committed by the U.S. murderers in Korea and Northeast China and Qingdao are by no means isolated events; the U.S. aggressors have long regarded bacteriological weapons as one of their magic weapons for dominating the world. The U.S. government began preparing for bacteriological warfare as early as ten years ago, and after the end of World War II, U.S. generals and officials constantly clamored to use bacteriological weapons to realize their dream of ruling the world. They openly advocated that the use of bacteriological weapons was the "cheapest" way for the United States to conquer the world and massacre mankind. Therefore, the U.S. Chemical Corps was sent to Korea in July 1950 to prepare for bacteriological and chemical warfare. Their heinous experiments with bacteriological weapons have long been notorious. The large-scale germ warfare they are now carrying out is a further exposure of the U.S. aggressors' heinous ambition to conquer all of Korea, then Asia, and then the world.
    As the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council said in its letter to all men and women of the world: "Germ warfare is not only a heinous crime that should be stopped, but also a threat to all mankind." Peace-loving people all over the world must and must resolutely stop the insane crimes of the U.S. murderers. In view of the fact that bacteriological weapons are completely contrary to humanity and pose an extremely serious threat to the universal security of mankind, international law has long declared a ban on such weapons of mass destruction. The Hague Convention of 1907 on the Regulations and Customs of Land Warfare and the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which was jointly signed by most countries in the world, clearly stipulated the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. The "Letter to the United Nations" adopted by the Warsaw Conference of the World Peace Congress, representing the common will of hundreds of millions of people around the world, put forward the demand for "unconditional prohibition of all atomic, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gases, radioactive weapons and other instruments of mass destruction; declaring the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal." However, the U.S. aggressors dared to blatantly violate the prohibitions of international law and disregard the solemn resolutions of the World Peace Congress, and systematically and on a large scale used brutal and inhumane bacteriological weapons. Therefore, all peaceful mankind can absolutely not forgive the U.S. aggressors. The movement to protest against U.S. germ warfare has not only surged in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, but has also become a widespread mass action in capitalist countries. The great call against germ warfare issued by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at its Oslo meeting fully and completely represents the firm will of hundreds of millions of people around the world to demand an end to the heinous crimes of the U.S. murderers. In this call, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council "demands that the people of the world exert pressure on their own governments so that all countries, without exception, sign, ratify and abide by" the international convention of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons, and "demands that strong action be taken to bring to justice as war criminals those criminals who use the most despicable and heinous weapons." This is absolutely necessary. This is the step that mankind should take for self-defense.
    The expansion of the world's peace movement shows that the will of the people of all countries to demand peace and stop war is becoming more and more firm, and the strength is becoming more and more powerful. The declaration of the World Peace Council's Berlin Conference calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact was quickly signed by more than 600 million men and women in countries around the world. Despite the fact that the imperialist countries headed by the United States disregarded the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic weapons, etc., disregarded the warnings of the World Peace Council, and continued to frantically carry out arms expansion and war preparations, intensified the arming of West Germany and Japan, and the United States openly used bacteriological weapons against the Chinese and Korean people, the devil is one foot high, and the Tao is ten feet high. The resolute actions of peace-loving people in all countries have the full potential to prevent the outbreak of a new war prepared by imperialism to destroy mankind. The Chinese people resolutely support the resolution of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at its Oslo meeting, and are willing to unite more closely with peace-loving people all over the world and take strong action to fight to the end to completely smash the germ warfare of the U.S. murderers.

### 为击败美帝国主义细菌战而斗争到底

    为击败美帝国主义细菌战而斗争到底
    世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议一致通过了题为“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，向美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行发出了庄严的正义声讨，号召全世界男女为制止美国细菌战罪行和要求禁止细菌武器而进行坚决的斗争。与此同时，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团发表了“关于美国在朝鲜的罪行的报告”及“关于美国军队在中国领土上使用细菌武器的报告”两个文件，对美国侵略者在中国和朝鲜进行细菌战以及其他种种残暴罪行提出了有力的罪证，并加以严厉的斥责。这无疑使世界和平理事会执行局为保卫世界和平、维护人类正义与安全而对美国侵略者发出的正义声讨，在道义上更加不可抗拒，并将必然得到全体正义人类的广泛响应和支持。
    美国侵略者向中朝人民进行细菌战的疯狂绝顶的罪行，早已是证据确凿，举世周知的了。我国中央人民政府外交部长周恩来、我国各民主党派、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永及世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里都曾先后发表声明，严重抗议并斥责美国侵略者的这一疯狂罪行。我国人民所组织的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”和国际民主法律工作者协会所派遣的调查团都已在朝鲜的前线和后方以及我国的东北地区进行了实地调查，收集了美国进行细菌战的大量罪证。并根据这些铁的罪证分别发表了调查报告。这些调查报告都以无可辩驳的事实证实了美国杀人犯确曾而且还在继续对中朝人民进行着细菌战；国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的调查报告，在证实美国进行细菌战的罪行之外，再次证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜使用了同样为国际公法所禁用的化学武器，对朝鲜和平居民进行了集体屠杀、谋杀及其他非人道的罪行。这些证据确凿的报告，对于全体正义人类反对细菌战的伟大斗争作了重要的贡献，使美国杀人犯没有狡赖的余地了。
    世界和平理事会执行局为了使各国爱好和平人民更广泛地了解事实真相，接受了我国保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的建议，决定成立一个由科学界、法律界和宗教界最有威望的代表参加的国际委员会，继续调查细菌战的罪证。这个委员会的建立和它将来的工作必然会得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持和拥护。
    美国杀人犯在朝鲜和我国东北及青岛等地所犯下的滔天罪行，绝不是孤立的事件；美国侵略者早就以为细菌武器是他们独霸世界的法宝之一。美国政府不但在十年前就开始准备细菌战争，并且在世界第二次大战结束以后，美国的将军和官员们就不断地叫嚣着要使用细菌武器来实现他们统治世界的迷梦。他们曾公开鼓吹使用细菌武器是美国征服世界、屠杀人类的“最便宜的”方式。因此，美国的化学部队于一九五○年七月就被派遣到朝鲜准备细菌战争和化学战争。他们进行细菌武器的罪恶实验，早已臭名远扬了。现在他们所进行的大规模的细菌战，则是美国侵略者希图征服全部朝鲜、进而征服亚洲和征服世界的罪恶野心进一步的暴露。
    正如世界和平理事会执行局在告全世界男女书中所说的：“细菌战不仅是应该予以制止的丑恶罪行，而且是对全人类的威胁。”世界爱好和平的人民，对于美国杀人犯的疯狂罪行是必须而且一定要坚决加以制止的。鉴于细菌武器完全违反人道及其对于人类普遍安全的极端严重的危害性，因而国际公法对于这种大规模毁灭人类的武器早已宣布禁用。一九○七年海牙公约关于陆战法规及惯例的条文和一九二五年为世界大多数国家所共同签订的日内瓦议定书，都明确地规定了对细菌武器的禁例。世界和平大会华沙大会所通过的“致联合国书”，代表世界亿万人民的共同意愿，提出了“无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯”的要求。但是，美国侵略者竟敢悍然破坏国际公法的禁例并置世界和平大会的庄严决议于不顾，有计划地大规模地使用了残暴不仁的细菌武器。因此，全体和平人类对美国侵略者是绝对不能宽恕的。抗议美国进行细菌战的运动不仅在苏联和各人民民主国家内汹涌起来，而且在各资本主义国家也已成为广泛的群众行动了。世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议所发出的反对细菌战的伟大号召，正是充分地、完全地代表了世界亿万人民要求制止美国杀人犯的滔天罪行的坚决意志。在这个号召中，世界和平理事会执行局“要求全世界人民对本国的政府施加压力，以使所有国家都毫无例外地签署、批准并遵守”一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的国际公约，“要求采取强有力的行动，把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。”这是完全必要的。这是人类为了自卫而应当采取的步骤。
    全世界保卫和平运动的扩展，说明了各国人民要求和平、制止战争的意志是越来越坚决，力量是越来越强大了。世界和平理事会柏林会议所提出的要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言，曾迅速得到了世界各国六亿以上男女的签名。尽管以美国为首的帝国主义国家不顾苏联要求禁用原子武器等的建议，不顾世界和平理事会的警告，继续疯狂地进行扩军备战，加紧武装西德和日本，美国并对中朝人民公开地使用了细菌武器，但是魔高一尺，道高一丈，各国爱好和平人民的坚决行动，完全有可能阻止帝国主义为毁灭人类而准备的新的战争的爆发。我国人民坚决拥护世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议的决议，并愿和全世界爱好和平的人民更加紧密地团结在一起，采取强有力的行动，为彻底粉碎美国杀人犯的细菌战而斗争到底。
