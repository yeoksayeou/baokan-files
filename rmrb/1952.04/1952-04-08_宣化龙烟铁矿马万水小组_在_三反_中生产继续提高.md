The Ma Wanshui excavation team of Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, led by the national labor model Ma Wanshui, set a new mine record in February by excavating 353.1 cubic meters in a level tunnel. In the anti-corruption struggle, all the team members, under the slogan "Leave the pit to actively 'fight tigers,' and go down the pit to actively produce," further promoted the working class's spirit of hard work, endurance, and active research. Their work area, Pit 44, is a windy location; coupled with the water dripping constantly from the roof of the tunnel onto their bodies, the workers were often chilled to the bone by the cold. However, they persevered with their work. The water flowing down from above Pit 44 flooded the transportation road several times, but Ma Wanshui took the lead in rescue efforts, quickly restoring safe transportation. All team members cherish every minute of production time. After starting work, as soon as the wind power arrives, they immediately drill holes and set off explosives. After the blast, before the blower can remove the fumes, the loaders go in to load the cars, each determined to "not leave work until all the slag (ore) is removed." They produce in three shifts, and the allocation of labor is adjusted at any time according to production needs and the workers' level of skill, so that everyone can fully utilize their abilities. This has greatly improved production efficiency. The Ma Wanshui team attaches great importance to safety work. Since last July, there has not been a single work-related injury.

    宣化龙烟铁矿马万水小组
    在“三反”中生产继续提高
    宣化龙烟铁矿全国劳动模范马万水领导的掘进小组，今年二月份又创平巷掘进三百五十三点一立方公尺的全矿最高纪录。在反贪污斗争中，全组职工在“出坑积极‘打虎’，下坑积极生产”的口号下，更加发挥了工人阶级刻苦耐劳、积极钻研的精神。他们工作的地区——四十四坑，是个风口；加上掘进迎头顶板上的水不住往身上滴，职工经常被寒气侵袭得浑身发冷。但他们始终坚持工作。四十四坑上面流下来的水，好几次淹没了运输路；但由马万水带头抢救，迅速恢复了安全运输。全组职工很珍惜每一分的生产时间。上班后，风力来了，他们马上打眼放炮。放完炮不等吹风机把炮烟吹掉，装车工就进去装车，个个都要“推不完碴（矿石）不下班”。他们分三班生产，劳动力的分配是按生产需要和职工生产技术的熟练程度而随时调整的，使每个人能充分发挥能力。这样就大大提高了生产效率。马万水小组很重视保安工作。自去年七月到现在，没出一次工伤事故。（王庆云、汪圻）
