	In the drought prevention and combat and patriotic production increase campaign,
	all regions have achieved great success in the work of cultivating land on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel,
	and generally paid attention to creating conditions for increasing the unit area yield of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel.
	During the spring plowing season this year, all regions, in conjunction with the drought prevention and combat campaign, have made urgent arrangements and inspections for the work of cultivating land on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, thus achieving great success and laying a solid foundation for the year's work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel.
	The greatest feature of the land cultivation work in various regions this spring is that, under the general requirement of patriotic high yield, attention has been paid to creating conditions for increasing the unit area yield of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. In the land cultivation instructions issued by governments at all levels, it is generally emphasized that doing a good job in cultivating land on behalf of others is an important part of striving for an all-round bumper harvest of agricultural products, requiring that not a single mu of land belonging to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel be left uncultivated, and that the land cultivated on behalf of others be cultivated carefully and with more fertilizer, so that it can achieve the same increase in production as the land of ordinary farmers. At present, this requirement has been implemented into concrete plans in various regions. For example, the land cultivation plan of Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province proposes "three fixings" (the land cultivated on behalf of others must be cultivated on time, without violating the farming season; the quantity must be fixed so that the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel can achieve the same increase in production as the land of the masses; the quality must be fixed so that the grain produced on the land cultivated on behalf of others is full of grains), "four guarantees" (guarantee good cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting), and strive to achieve an average increase of ten to fifteen catties per mu of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. The masses in most parts of Northeast China have proposed to guarantee an increase of five to seven liters of grain per mu of land cultivated on behalf of others. Sixteen land cultivation groups in Xiguan Street, Changle County, Fujian Province, all plan to make the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel reach a yield of 1,050 catties per mu, an increase of 15% over last year.
	In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, all regions have first focused on helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel solve the fertilizer problem. Some areas in Northeast and North China have launched a campaign to donate a basket of manure per person to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. The suburban areas of many large and medium-sized cities have mobilized the masses to pull garbage into the city as fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. In areas such as East China and Central South China that grow paddy fields, the masses help the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel clean manure tanks and dig river mud. Experience has proven that this method of mobilizing the masses to help each other is effective. For example, the masses in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, have accumulated 18,779,050 catties of fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel by digging black mud, exchanging kangs, and composting grass. According to the need of 1,500 catties per mu, this can solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for 12,519 mu of land. In addition, many county and district governments have also planned to raise fine fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, or provide them with convenience for accumulating and purchasing fertilizer. For example, in areas where land cultivation grain is planned, the county and district governments extract a part of the land cultivation grain to purchase oil cakes for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Feixiang County in Hebei alone has purchased 180,000 catties on their behalf. Some county and district governments also stipulate that a certain number of fertilizer accumulation workdays should be added to each mu of land cultivated on behalf of others to stimulate the enthusiasm of those cultivating land on behalf of others to accumulate fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Many cooperatives in various regions also give priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in lending fertilizer, or agree with the county and district governments to allow the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to exchange fertilizer at the cooperative with land cultivation work tickets. In this way, relying on the mutual assistance of the masses and the help of the government, plus the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel accumulating and purchasing fertilizer themselves, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel this year has generally increased compared to last year. For example, in Banbidian Village, Tongxian County, Hebei Province, each mu of land belonging to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel is fertilized with 2.1 carts of fertilizer, while the general masses only apply two carts of fertilizer. The increase in the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel has created a prerequisite for a bumper harvest of land cultivated on behalf of others this year.
	In the drought prevention and combat production campaign, all regions have generally ensured that the land of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel is plowed, moisture is conserved, water is diverted for irrigation, and timely cultivation is carried out in the same way as the land of ordinary farmers. In some places, the masses can also give priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. For example, according to the statistics of Dingxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, as of March 26, the land of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in Anping, Shenze, Raoyang, Xingtang, Wuji, and other five counties has been plowed once. In some places, it has been plowed and rolled two or three times. For example, the Lin Mingguang mutual aid group in Shanggan Town, Minhou County, Fujian Province, cultivated land on behalf of the family of Lin Xiangqian, a martyr of the "February 7th" strike. More than a month ago, they dug out 400 dan of fertile pond mud for the family of the martyr, and repaired the field ridges, replaced the water in the field with new water, and plowed and harrowed it several times. In the drought-stricken areas of Rehe and Chahar provinces, many farmers actively carried ice blocks on their backs to moisten the soil for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel.
	The main reasons why the land cultivation work can achieve the above results are: (1) The leadership attaches importance to it. The civil affairs departments above the provincial (administrative office) level have made timely arrangements and instructions. The People's Government of Chahar Province has issued two consecutive instructions. In addition, all regions regard this work as a part of the entire agricultural production work and hand it over to the drought prevention and combat offices at all levels for arrangement and inspection, thus arousing the attention of cadres and the masses to this work. (2) The political awareness of the masses has increased. With the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the Spring Festival support the army and give preferential treatment to family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel campaign, the masses have generally realized that doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and cultivating land on their behalf is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. Therefore, in many areas, the masses can take the initiative to formulate land cultivation plans, revise and supplement patriotic covenants, and think of various ways to overcome difficulties for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, even when the superiors are unable to supervise and inspect them during the "Three-Anti" movement.
	However, it cannot be denied that the arrangements for the land cultivation work this year have generally been delayed a bit, and many regions have not yet had time to conduct inspections, so there are still many problems. For example, some new areas have not formed a regular system for the land cultivation work, and some areas have not even paid attention to this work at all. Even in areas with a better work foundation, the living and production problems of individual families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel have not been well resolved. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels in various regions should promptly conduct inspections and correct these shortcomings. (Zhen Yu)

    在防旱抗旱和爱国增产运动中
    各地为烈属军属代耕的工作有很大成绩
    一般都注意了为提高烈属军属土地的单位面积产量创造条件
    今年春耕期间，各地都结合防旱、抗旱运动，对于给烈属军属代耕的工作抓紧布置和检查，因而做出很大成绩，为全年的优待烈属军属工作奠定了稳固的基础。
    今春各地代耕工作的最大特点，是在爱国丰产的总要求下，都注意到为提高烈属军属土地的单位面积产量创造条件。在各级人民政府发出的代耕指示中，一般都强调指出做好代耕工作是争取农产全面丰收的一个重要部分，要求各地不但不能荒芜烈属军属一亩土地，而且要对代耕土地精耕细作，多施肥料，使能和一般农民的土地同样达到增产。目前，各地已把这一要求贯彻到具体计划中。如河北省邯郸专区的代耕计划中，提出“三定”（代耕土地要定时耕作，不违农时；定量，要使烈属军属土地能和群众土地一样达到增产；定质，作到代耕土地所产的粮食籽粒饱满）、“四保”（保证耕好、种好、锄好、收好），争取作到烈属军属土地每亩平均多产十斤到十五斤。东北大部地区群众提出保证每亩代耕土地增产五升到七升粮。福建长乐县西关街十六个代耕组都计划使烈属军属土地每亩达到产量一千零五十斤，比去年增产一成半。
    为了达到增产的目的，各地都首先抓紧帮助烈属军属解决肥料问题。东北、华北的部分地区发动了每人捐助烈属军属一筐粪的运动，不少大、中城市的郊区发动群众为烈属军属到市内拉垃圾作肥料；在华东、中南等种水田的地区，群众帮助烈属军属清粪缸、挖河泥。经验证明，这种发动群众互助互济的办法是行之有效的。如河北省香河县群众用挖黑泥、换炕、沤草等办法，已为烈属军属积肥一千八百七十七万九千零五十斤，按每亩需用一千五百斤计，可以解决一万二千五百一十九亩土地缺少肥料的问题。另外许多县区政府也有计划地为烈属军属筹措细肥，或给他们以积肥、购肥的方便。如在统筹代耕粮的地区，由县区政府抽出一部代耕粮为烈属军属成宗地购买油饼，只河北肥乡一个县，就已代买了十八万斤。也有的县区政府规定每亩代耕土地增加若干积肥工，以刺激代耕人积极地为烈属军属积肥。不少地区的合作社在贷肥中也优先照顾烈属军属，或者和县区政府约好，准许烈属军属持代耕工票到合作社换肥料。这样依靠群众的互助和政府的帮助，再加烈属军属自己积肥和购肥，今年烈属军属土地的施肥量一般较去年有增加。如河北省通县半壁店村烈属军属每亩土地施肥二点一车，而一般群众则仅施肥两车。烈属、军属土地施肥量的增加，给今年代耕土地丰产创造了先决条件。
    在防旱、抗旱生产运动中，各地对烈属、军属土地一般都作到和一般农民的土地同样耙地保墒、引水灌溉和及时耕种，有些地方的群众并能作到优先照顾烈属军属。如河北省定县专区截至三月二十六日的统计，安平、深泽、饶阳、行唐、无极等五县烈属军属土地已普耙一遍。有些地方则已耙、轧两遍到三遍。又如福建闽侯尚干镇林明光互助组为“二七”烈士林祥谦家属代耕，早在一个多月以前就为烈属挖出肥沃的池泥四百担，并锄整了田堘，把田里换上了新水，犁耙了好几次。热河、察哈尔省干旱地区，许多农民主动地为烈属军属背冰块润土。
    代耕工作能得到以上成绩的主要原因是：（一）领导方面重视。各省（行署）以上民政部门，都适时地作了布置和指示，察哈尔省人民政府连续发出去两次指示。另外，各地都把这一工作看成是整个农业生产工作的一部分，交由各级抗旱、防旱办公室作了布置和检查，因而引起了干部和群众对这个工作的重视。（二）群众的政治觉悟提高。随着抗美援朝运动和春节拥军优属运动的开展，群众一般已认识到做好优属代耕工作是爱国的一项具体表现，所以不少地区的群众能在“三反”运动中上级无暇督促检查的情况下，主动地制订代耕计划，修正补充爱国公约，帮助烈属军属想出各种克服困难的办法。
    但也不可否认，今年对代耕工作的布置一般都推迟了些，不少地区还没有来得及进行检查，因而存在的问题还是不少的。如部分新区没有把代耕工作形成经常制度，有的地区甚至根本还没有重视这个工作。就是在工作基础较好的地区，也有个别烈属军属的生活问题生产问题还没有得到很好的解决。因此，各地各级领导干部应当迅速进行检查，纠正这些缺点。（振宇）
