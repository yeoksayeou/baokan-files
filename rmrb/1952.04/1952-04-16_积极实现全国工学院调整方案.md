    Actively Implement the National Engineering Institute Adjustment Plan
    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a National Engineering Institute Presidents' Conference in November 1951 and drafted a plan for the adjustment of departments and faculties in national engineering institutes. This plan has been approved by the Government Administration Council and is announced today.
    This plan is an important step in implementing the "Decision on Reforming the Educational System" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, reforming the old higher education system, teaching content, and teaching methods in a planned and step-by-step manner, and is suitable for the characteristics of the initial stage of our national construction and the needs of industrial construction. We must conscientiously and with full preparation do this work well.
    The higher education institutions that old China left us were originally products of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. They were suited to the needs of imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. In these schools, the dependency on imperialism, the blind worship of Anglo-American bourgeois culture by some teachers, the bad habits of detachment from reality and dogmatism, the deep influence of bourgeois educational thought, the phenomenon of setting up departments according to colleges, setting up courses according to individuals, the parochialism and sectarianism between schools, between departments, and between individuals, the unplanned and anarchic state in the establishment, distribution, and division of labor of departments and faculties, and the chaos and extravagance in manpower and material resources were further exposed in this great "Three-Anti" movement. If this situation is not thoroughly reformed, then these higher education institutions, which now belong to the people, will still not be able to undertake the great task of cultivating a large number of senior construction talents who can wholeheartedly serve the people for the new China. In the past two years, we have carried out preliminary reform work on higher education and have made some progress in higher education institutions; but this reform and progress undoubtedly lags far behind the needs of national construction. This engineering institute adjustment plan, starting from the overall situation of the national engineering institute departments and faculties, and focusing on the adjustment of the engineering institute departments and faculties of universities in the North China, East China, and Central South regions, comprehensively adjusts them according to the needs of national industrial construction and the existing foundations of each department and faculty, and clearly stipulates the tasks, division of labor, and development direction of each department and faculty. This facilitates close contact between these departments and faculties and relevant industrial departments, starting from reality and combining with actual needs. This is not only an important measure to reform the old higher education system from the organizational level, but also will create favorable conditions for reforming the old educational content and implementing the educational policy of unity between theory and practice.
    Our country is actively preparing to move towards industrialization. To develop industry, especially heavy industry, there is an urgent need for a large number of senior technical personnel. This adjustment plan stipulates that a total of 29,500 new students will be enrolled in undergraduate, specialized, and technical schools of national engineering institutes in the summer vacation of 1952, accounting for 59 percent of the total number of students enrolled in national higher education institutions, of which undergraduate students account for 45 percent, and specialized and technical school students account for 55 percent; this not only maintains a certain level of industrial higher education, but also takes into account the urgent needs of national construction talents, and takes both aspects into consideration and coordinated development. This is completely necessary and reasonable at present. This begins to change the blindness and anarchy of educational facilities, and gradually puts it on the road of combining with reality and developing in a planned way.
    According to the existing faculty and equipment of national engineering institute departments and faculties and industrial technical schools, if they continue to operate as before, they can only enroll a maximum of 15,000 new students this year, but after reasonable adjustment and slight supplementation, they can increase the enrollment of new students by one-fold. This overcomes the serious waste caused by the dispersion and chaos of faculty and equipment and the incompatibility of teaching tasks, and greatly leverages the potential strength of existing manpower and material resources. In terms of school building construction, basic equipment, and adjustment expenses, we should all carry forward the revolutionary spirit, not be afraid of being simple and crude, in order to achieve the goal of saving the country's financial expenditure and training more industrial talents for the country.
    Of course, as far as national higher education institutions are concerned, this adjustment plan is only preliminary and is only a beginning. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and relevant departments should also be prepared to carry out further adjustment work: from the adjustment of colleges to the adjustment of departments and faculties, from the adjustment of engineering institute departments and faculties to the adjustment of other departments and faculties, from the adjustment of key points to the adjustment of all aspects, from the reform of the education system to the reform of education content and teaching methods. After the ideological remolding movement and the "Three-Anti" movement, the level of awareness of teachers has improved a step, and everyone will more actively demand adjustment and reform. This gives great hope for the thorough reform of higher education in 1952.
    In order to perfectly implement this plan, we must also fully estimate the difficulties that may be encountered and must make good preparations. First of all, we must continue to carry out ideological preparation work, so that teachers and students can clearly understand the consistency of national interests and personal interests, and recognize that national interests are the greatest and most long-term interests of individuals; overcome various erroneous thoughts, such as conservative thoughts that only look backward and not forward, narrow and selfish extreme individualism, and parochialism and sectarianism thoughts such as "only willing to be transferred in, not willing to be transferred out," "only can expand, not willing to take over the mess," and "there is entry and exit, but no entry or exit." These erroneous thoughts have caused losses to education in the past, and have also been subjected to due criticism and condemnation in this "Three-Anti" movement. All faculty and staff of higher education institutions must thoroughly correct these erroneous thoughts, and must proceed from the thought of serving the people and the motherland, and correctly carry out the work of department and faculty adjustment and education reform. Second, we must complete all enrollment plans, and the administrative departments must not arbitrarily transfer existing high school students to work. We must encourage them to pursue further studies and serve national construction, and strive for all high school graduates to enter higher education institutions. In order to increase the source of students, the troops and agencies should transfer cadres to higher education institutions in accordance with regulations to train them into senior construction talents. Enrollment work is an arduous and complex organizational work, and all relevant parties must earnestly do this work well, grasp the key points, and rationally allocate enrollment quotas. Party and League organizations should play a guaranteeing role in this work. Third, sending a large number of revolutionary cadres to higher education institutions to train them into senior construction talents is of great political significance; but due to their different components, different experiences, and uneven cultural levels, there will inevitably be difficulties in teaching. How to take active measures to specifically help them overcome difficulties? The schools must prepare early. Fourth, in this enrollment plan, students in specialized and technical schools account for more than half. How to adjust the teaching plan to suit actual needs? How to streamline courses and teaching materials? Careful study is necessary, and preparations must be made in advance.
    Cultivating industrial technical talents has a decisive significance for the country's industrialization. The adjustment of national engineering institutes will make a major contribution to the cultivation of industrial talents in our country. We hope that all relevant parties in the country will pool their wisdom and efforts, closely cooperate, and actively strive to realize this adjustment plan.

### 积极实现全国工学院调整方案

    积极实现全国工学院调整方案
    中央人民政府教育部在一九五一年十一月召开了全国工学院院长会议，拟定了全国工学院院系调整的方案。这个方案，已经政务院批准，今天公布了。
    这个方案，是实行中央人民政府政务院“关于改革学制的决定”，有计划、有步骤地改革旧的高等教育制度、教学内容和教学方法的一个重要步骤，是适合于我们国家建设初期的特点和工业建设的需要的。我们必须认真地并有充分准备地把这个工作做好。
    旧中国所遗留给我们的高等学校，原来是半殖民地半封建社会的产物。它是适合于帝国主义和反动统治阶级的需要的。在这些学校中，过去所遗留下来的那种对于帝国主义的依附性，一部分教师们的那种对于英美资产阶级文化的盲目崇拜，那种脱离实际的、教条主义的恶习，那种资产阶级教育思想的深厚影响，那种因院设系、因人设课的现象，那种校和校之间、系和系之间、人和人之间的本位主义和宗派主义作风，那种在院系设置、分布和分工上的无计划无政府状态，以及那种在人力物力方面的凌乱和铺张浪费的情形，在这次伟大的“三反”运动中更加暴露了。这种情况如果不加以彻底的改革，那么，这些现在已经属于人民的高等学校就仍然不可能很好地担负起为新中国培养大批能够全心全意为人民服务的高级建设人才的巨大任务。两年来，我们对高等教育曾进行了初步的改革工作，并使高等学校有了一定程度的进步；但这种改革和进步，无疑地远远赶不上国家建设的需要。这次工学院调整方案，从全国工学院系总的情况出发，而以华北、华东、中南三个地区各大学的工学院系为调整重点，根据国家工业建设的需要和各院系的现有基础，通盘加以调整，明确规定了各院系的任务、分工和发展的方向。这就便于这些院系和有关工业部门密切联系，从实际出发，并和实际需要相结合。这不仅是从组织上改革旧的高等教育制度的重要措施，而且将为改革旧的教育内容、贯彻理论和实际一致的教育方针创造有利的条件。
    我们的国家正在积极地准备走向工业化。要发展工业，首先是重工业，就迫切地需要大批的高级技术人才。这次调整方案规定了一九五二年暑假全国工学院本科、专修科和专科学校共招收新生二万九千五百名，占全国高等学校招生总名额的百分之五十九，其中本科学生占百分之四十五，专修科和专科学校学生占百分之五十五；这样既能维持工业高等教育的一定水平，也照顾了国家建设人才的迫切需要，两方面统筹兼顾，配合发展。这在目前来说是完全必要的和合理的。这就开始改变了教育设施的盲目性和无政府状态，使它逐渐走上结合实际和有计划地发展的道路。
    全国工学院系和工业专科学校，按现有的师资和设备状况来说，如果照老样子办下去，今年最多只能招收新生一万五千名，但经过合理调整以后，略加补充就可以增收新生一倍。这就克服了由于师资和设备分散凌乱、教学任务不相适应因而造成的严重浪费现象，大大地发挥了现有人力物力的潜在力量。在校舍修建、基本设备和调整用费等方面，我们都应该发扬革命精神，不怕因陋就简，以求达到既能节省国家财政的开支，又能替国家训练出更多工业人才的目的。
    当然，就全国的高等学校来讲，这个调整方案还只是初步的，只是一个开端。中央人民政府教育部和有关部门还应该有准备地进行进一步的调整工作：从学院的调整进到科系的调整，从工学院系的调整进到其他院系的调整，从重点的调整进到全面的调整，从教育制度的改革进到教育内容和教学方法的改革。教师们经过了思想改造运动和“三反”运动，觉悟程度提高了一步，大家便会更积极地要求调整、要求改革。这就使一九五二年高等教育的彻底改革有了很大的希望。
    为了完满地实现这个方案，我们还要充分估计到可能遇到的困难，必须很好地进行准备工作。首先，要继续进行思想准备工作，使教师学生都能明确认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认识国家利益才是个人最大的利益和最长远的利益；克服种种错误思想，如只向后看不向前看的保守思想、狭隘自私的极端个人主义思想、以及“只愿调进，不愿调出”、“只可扩大，不愿收烂摊子”、“有进有出，不进也不出”的本位主义和宗派主义思想等。这些错误思想过去已经使教育事业受到损失，在这次“三反”运动中也已受到应有的批判和指责。高等学校的全体教职员工必须彻底纠正这些错误思想，必须一切从为人民、为祖国服务的思想出发，来正确地进行院系调整和教育改革的工作。第二，要完成全部招生计划，对现有的高中学生，绝不能由行政部门随便抽调去工作，要鼓励他们升学深造为国家建设服务，争取高中毕业生全部升入高等学校。为了增加学生来源，部队、机关应该依照规定抽调干部入高等学校，把他们培养成为高级建设人才。招生工作是一件艰巨复杂的组织工作，各有关方面必须认真地把这个工作做好，抓住重点，合理分配招生名额，党、团组织对于这项工作应该起保证作用。第三，将大批革命干部送入高等学校，培养他们成为高级建设人才，是有重大的政治意义的；但是由于他们的成份不同，经历不同，文化程度不齐，教学上就不免有困难，如何采取积极的办法，具体地帮助他们克服困难？学校方面必须早做准备。第四，在这次招生计划中，专修科和专科学校的学生占半数以上，如何将教学计划调整得适合实际的需要？如何精简课程和教材？必须细心研究，事先妥为准备。
    培养工业技术人才，对国家的工业化具有决定的意义。全国工学院的调整对于我国工业人才的培养将有重大的贡献，我们希望全国各有关方面，群策群力，密切配合，积极地为实现这个调整方案而努力。
