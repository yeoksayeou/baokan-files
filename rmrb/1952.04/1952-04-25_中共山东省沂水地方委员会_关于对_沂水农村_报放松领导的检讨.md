Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editors: The April 1st "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily published a letter from Li Hua and seven other comrades, criticizing the CCP Yishui Prefectural Committee for relaxing its leadership over the "Yishui Rural" newspaper. This criticism is essentially correct.

    The "Yishui Rural" newspaper was officially launched on January 1st of this year. All aspects lacked experience, and it was very necessary to strengthen leadership. However, for the past three months, our attention to and leadership of the Party newspaper has indeed been insufficient. When the newspaper was launched, the Prefectural Committee was fully engaged in the intense "Three-Anti" struggle, and all the comrades of the Prefectural Committee's Propaganda Department were assigned to various enterprises to fight "tigers," thus relaxing and abandoning the leadership of the Party's propaganda work. First and foremost, we relaxed and neglected the political leadership of the Party newspaper work. The Prefectural Committee did not seriously and accurately stipulate the newspaper's guiding principles and tasks for each period, nor did it carefully and meticulously review the newspaper, resulting in several errors of principle in the March newspaper (such as modifying the declarations of the democratic parties against germ warfare). The Prefectural Committee's ideological leadership of the newspaper's cadres was very poor, and no proper arrangements were made for the cadres' political treatment (such as attending meetings and reading documents), resulting in insufficient contact between the newspaper and the Prefectural Committee. Secondly, the Prefectural Committee paid very little attention to the organizational construction and business management of the newspaper. In general, the Prefectural Committee still treated the Party's propaganda work with bureaucracy during the "Three-Anti" movement.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party newspaper work and quickly solve some of the problems existing in the current newspaper work, the Prefectural Committee, in addition to conducting self-criticism, also instructed the comrades of the Party Newspaper Committee to take advantage of the gaps in the "Three-Anti" movement to convene a meeting in late March to conduct a special review and make a self-criticism to the newspaper cadres. The Party Newspaper Committee also, in early April, specifically summarized and reviewed the three months of newspaper work from the bottom up, and proposed a series of measures to improve the Party newspaper work, which were submitted to the Prefectural Committee for discussion and implementation. As for the ideological examination of newspaper cadres, the establishment and improvement of work systems, and other issues, they will all be resolved according to the established plan in the fourth stage of the "Three-Anti" movement in April.

### 中共山东省沂水地方委员会  关于对“沂水农村”报放松领导的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共山东省沂水地方委员会
    关于对“沂水农村”报放松领导的检讨
    编辑同志：四月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了李华等八位同志的来信，针对中共沂水地委放松对“沂水农村”报的领导工作提出了批评，这一批评基本上是正确的。
    “沂水农村”报在今年一月一日正式创刊，各方面都缺乏经验，很需要加强领导。但是三个月来，我们对党报的重视和领导确实是很不够的。报纸创刊时，因为地委全力投入了紧张的“三反”斗争，地委宣传部的同志们全部被派到各企业部门包打“老虎”，因而放松和放弃了对党的宣传工作的领导；首先是放松和忽视了对党报工作的政治领导。地委没有认真确切地规定每个时期的办报方针、任务，认真细心地审查报纸，致三月份的报纸中曾发生了几次原则性的错误（如修改各民主党派反细菌战的宣言等）。地委对报社干部的思想领导很差，对干部的政治待遇（如参加会议、阅读文件等）没作妥善的安排，致报社和地委间的联系不够密切。其次，地委对报社的组织建设和企业化经营等方面也极少关注。总的说来，地委在“三反”运动中仍然是以官僚主义对待党的宣传工作的。
    为了加强对党报工作的领导，迅速解决目前报纸工作中存在的一些问题，地委除自身作了检讨外，并责令党报委员会的同志们利用“三反”运动中的空隙，在三月下旬召开了会议，作了专门检查，并向报社干部作了检讨。党报委员会又在四月上旬，自下而上具体地总结检查了三个月的办报工作，并提出了一系列的改进党报工作的措施，交地委讨论后执行。至于报社干部的思想检查、工作制度的建立和改进等问题，都将按既定计划，在四月份“三反”运动第四阶段中解决。
