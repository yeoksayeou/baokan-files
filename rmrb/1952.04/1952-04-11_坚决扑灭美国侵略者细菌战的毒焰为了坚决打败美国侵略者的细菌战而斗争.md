    Resolutely Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of the American Aggressors’ Germ Warfare; Struggle to Resolutely Defeat the American Aggressors’ Germ Warfare
    Standing Committee of the Pediatric Society of the Chinese Medical Association
    Since January 28th of this year, the American aggressors have repeatedly spread insects and infectious materials carrying bacteria in Korea and Northeast China, attempting to harm the peaceful residents of vast areas of Korea and China. This heinous crime has aroused the public outrage of people all over the world, and people all over the world have demanded that the American imperialist germ warfare criminals be severely punished. The investigation team sent by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has visited various places in Korea and Northeast China and recorded in detail the crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria. The "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialist Germ Warfare" that departed from Beijing has obtained many evidences of germ warfare, and even the witnesses and material evidence have been made into movies and photographs. The facts are all there, the evidence is irrefutable, and US Secretary of State Acheson cannot deny it. The American aggressors have committed such heinous crimes, trying to cover them up, and the more they try to deny them, the more hideous their faces become. We medical workers study bacteria to prevent diseases and protect human health, but the American aggressors use bacteria to harm good people. We pediatric workers are busy all day long to reduce the suffering of diseases and ensure the development and health of children, but the cruel American aggressors throw germ bombs and spread various insects and items carrying bacteria, wanting to create plagues, and even the lovely children have to suffer their poison. From this, we can more clearly recognize that the American aggressors are completely inhuman, are criminals of science, and are the mortal enemies of peace-loving people.
    Our Association responds to the call of Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, on February 22nd, regarding the defense against germ warfare, "medical workers across the country should take active actions to combat the American aggressors with practical actions." We hope that every one of our members, in order to love our motherland and protect the health of the broad masses of people, will do their best to do a good job in the movement of preventing epidemics and eliminating bacteria. In terms of propaganda, we must make the masses pay attention not to be paralyzed, raise vigilance, do a good job in environmental sanitation, so that bacteria cannot breed, and also be full of high confidence, recognizing that germ warfare cannot be ignored, but it is not terrible, and we have the power to defend against it. In terms of daily work, we must do more vaccinations to reduce the incidence of various childhood infectious diseases, eliminate the mental burden of many parents, and ensure the quiet order of the masses. In terms of defense work, we should actively assist the government in organizing epidemic prevention forces, creating various favorable conditions to eliminate the breeding and activities of bacterial pests. And we must be well prepared, and immediately disinfect and eliminate any cases of epidemics found on the spot. As long as all health personnel and the people of the whole country take active action and take various effective measures, the American aggressors' germ warfare conspiracy will surely suffer a shameful defeat.
    We call on every member of the Pediatric Society to fight to the end with a fighting attitude and make the greatest efforts to resolutely defeat the American imperialist germ warfare.

    坚决扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰为了坚决打败美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争
    中华医学会儿科学会常务委员会
    自本年一月二十八日开始，美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北，接二连三地撒布带有细菌的昆虫和传染物，企图残害朝鲜和我国广大地区的和平居民。这种万恶不赦的罪行，已经引起全世界人民的公愤，全世界人民纷纷要求严惩美帝国主义细菌战犯。国际民主法律工作者协会派来的调查团，已经到过朝鲜和我国东北各地，详细地记录了美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪行。从北京出发的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”已经获得了细菌战的许多罪证，连人证、物证都拍成电影和照片。事实俱在，铁证如山，美国国务卿艾奇逊是抵赖不了的。美国侵略者犯了这样的滔天罪行，欲盖弥彰，愈想抵赖，愈见其狰狞面目。我们医务工作者研究细菌，是为了预防疾病、保护人类的健康，而美国侵略者却利用细菌残害善良的人民。我们儿科工作者终日辛忙，是为减除病苦，保证儿童们的发育和健康，而残酷的美国侵略者投掷细菌弹、撒布多种负荷细菌的昆虫和物品，想要制造疫疠，连可爱的儿童们也都要遭受它们的毒害。我们由此更可认清美国侵略者全无人性，是科学的罪人，是和平人民的死敌。
    我会响应中华医学会总会傅连暲理事长二月二十二日关于防御细菌战要“全国医药工作者积极行动起来，以实际行动打击美国侵略者”的号召，希望我们每一个会员，为了爱护我们的祖国，为了保护广大人民的健康，尽最大努力来搞好预防疫病、扑灭细菌的运动。在宣传方面，要使群众注意不要麻痹，提高警惕，做好环境卫生，使细菌无从孳生，还要充满高度的信心，认识到细菌战不可忽视，但也并不可怕，我们有力量来防御。在日常工作方面，必须多做预防注射，减少各种儿童传染病的发病率，消除许多家长们的精神负担，也就保证了群众的安静秩序。在防御工作上，更应积极协助政府组织防疫力量，创造各种有利条件，用以消灭细菌毒虫的繁殖和活动。而且要有很好的准备，就地发现疫例，即可就地消毒和扑灭。只要全体卫生人员和全国人民积极行动起来，采取各种有效的措施，美国侵略者的细菌战阴谋，就一定会遭到可耻的失败。
    我们号召每一个儿科学会的会员，以战斗的姿态，竭尽最大的努力，为了坚决打败美帝国主义的细菌战奋斗到底。
