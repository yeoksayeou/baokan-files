Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 4th—At the third item agenda subcommittee of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 4th, our side reiterated our position on the issue of neutral nations nominations and a reasonable solution, and demanded that the other side withdraw its so-called request to restrict airport equipment in North Korea, which interferes in our internal affairs.
    At the fourth item agenda staff meeting, the staff members of both sides agreed to temporarily adjourn the meeting from today onwards, so that both sides could explore ways to discuss the existing issues of the fourth item agenda during the adjournment. The date of resumption will be decided by the liaison officers of both sides in the future.

    我重申中立国提名问题立场
    【新华社开城四日电】四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方重申我方对中立国提名问题的立场和合理解决方案，并要求对方撤消所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的干涉我方内政的要求。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方参谋人员同意自即日起暂时休会，以便双方在休会期间增辟讨论第四项议程现存问题的途径。复会的日期将在以后经由双方联络官决定。
