The experience of the Northeast in carrying out production increase.

The agricultural abundance competition movement carried out in the rural areas of Northeast China last year has rich experiences. Last year, more than 200,000 labor mutual aid groups in the Northeast region participated in the competition successively, and many individual farmers also participated. Although many areas suffered from natural disasters such as spring drought and autumn floods, as a result of carrying out the competition, the total output of agricultural and sideline production in the entire region still increased by 3.3 percent compared with 1950, reaching 98.1 percent of the original planned output, and creating good conditions for continuing to carry out large-scale production competitions in rural areas this year.

The main experiences of the Northeast are as follows: 1. Concrete and in-depth organizational leadership work is the decisive key to mobilizing farmers to participate in the production competition. Last spring, leading cadres at all levels in Shulan County, Jilin Province, went deep into the grassroots level, with county-level leaders going deep into villages, district cadres going deep into mutual aid groups, and village cadres going deep into farmers' households, to conduct patriotic production increase ideological education for farmers, and helped each mutual aid group and each farmer's household to formulate production increase plans, greatly promoting the production increase competition movement in the county. As a result, more than 85 percent of farmers in Shulan County participated in the competition last year, forming a continuous competition upsurge between groups and households in the region. In contrast, some areas (such as Fuyuan Village, Bayan County, Songjiang Province) only generally called on farmers to launch competitions, without or with very little concrete organizational leadership work, with the result that very few farmers participated in the competition. Last year, the farmers of Fuyuan Village, Bayan County, Songjiang Province, only began to take action after the village cadres changed their "empty talk" style.

2. The main purpose of carrying out the production competition movement is to increase the yield per unit area. Therefore, the content of the competition should not be too miscellaneous, so as not to distract energy. Most of the competition conditions proposed by various regions last year focused on improving farming techniques and overcoming natural disasters, such as promoting the use of new farm tools, planting fine varieties, increasing fertilization area, more hoeing and weeding, improving soil, repairing dikes to prevent flooding, drought resistance and insect control, etc. This is correct. Therefore, many facts of high yields of crops such as corn, millet, wheat, and soybeans appeared in Heilongjiang Province last year. However, a few areas also included hygiene, literacy, recreational activities, etc. in the competition conditions, which affected the enthusiasm of farmers to compete. Farmers said: "There are too many items, I can't remember them, I can't do them, so I won't compete."

3. Organizing regional continuous competitions with labor models as the core is a good way to create a mass competition movement. Last year, after the Yang Xianting Model Mutual Aid Group in Minzhu Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, challenged the mutual aid group in the outer district, it challenged locally, driving 95 percent of the farmers in the village to participate in the competition. However, at the beginning of the movement, some areas had labor models who "were willing to compete far but not willing to compete near," and the leading cadres were also satisfied with the challenges between labor models, without mobilizing the vast number of farmers to participate, which greatly limited the movement.

4. It is necessary to pay attention to mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the competition. They are an indispensable force for improving farming techniques, overcoming natural disasters, and striving for a good harvest. Last year, Wangqing, Yanji and other twelve counties in Jilin Province mobilized more than 530,000 women to participate in the competition during spring ploughing. They undertook tasks such as seed selection, trial planting, and grid stepping, and completed spring ploughing and sowing work in a timely manner. Last spring, Heilongjiang Province mobilized a large number of women to participate in drought resistance work, which played a great role in overcoming the drought.

5. Organizing production competitions must be combined with strengthening the work of mutual aid groups. Because the organized farmers are collective labor, production generally has a certain plan, and participating in production competitions has many favorable conditions than individual farmers. Experience has proved that in areas with a good foundation of mutual aid groups, the production competition movement is easy to carry out. Many areas have rectified mutual aid groups while organizing production competitions last year, which also greatly promoted the competition.

6. Seasonal inspections and evaluations are important ways to promote the continuous development of the competition movement. During the spring ploughing period last year, Yushu County, Jilin Province, mobilized farmers to "evaluate on the spot" and "evaluate while working," and conducted commendations and criticisms on the spot, which continuously improved the enthusiasm of farmers to compete. More than 80 percent of farmers in the county participated in the competition movement last year.

### 东北去年开展农业增产竞赛运动的经验

    东北去年开展农业增产竞赛运动的经验
    东北区去年开展增产的经验。
    东北农村去年开展的丰产竞赛运动有丰富的经验。去年，东北全区先后参加竞赛的劳动互助组共有二十多万个，并有许多单干户农民参加竞赛。虽然许多地区遭受了春旱、秋涝等自然灾害，开展竞赛的结果，保证了全区的农业、副业生产总产量仍比一九五○年增加百分之三点三，达到原订计划产量百分之九十八点一，并为今年农村中继续开展大规模的生产竞赛，创造了良好条件。
    东北的主要经验有以下几项：一、具体的、深入的组织领导工作是发动农民参加生产竞赛的决定关键。去年春天，吉林省舒兰县各级领导干部逐层深入，县级领导干部深入到村屯，区干部深入互助组，村干部深入农户，去对农民作爱国增产的思想教育，并帮助每个互助组和每个农户订增产计划，大大地推动了该县的增产竞赛运动。因而去年舒兰县百分之八十五以上的农户都参加了竞赛，形成了地区的组与组间和户与户间的连环竞赛的热潮。与此相反，有些地区（如松江省巴彦县富源村）只一般地号召农民展开竞赛，没有或很少作具体的组织领导工作，结果农民参加竞赛的很少。去年，松江省巴彦县富源村直到村干部转变了“空喊”作风后，农民才开始行动起来。
    二、开展生产竞赛运动的主要目的，在于提高单位面积产量，因此，竞赛内容不能太杂，以免分散精力。去年各地提出的竞赛条件，大多集中在改进农作技术和战胜天灾上，如推广使用新农具，播种优良品种，增加施肥面积，多铲多?，改良土壤，修堤防涝，抗旱防虫等。这是对的。因此，去年黑龙江省出现了很多玉米、谷子、小麦、大豆等作物得到高额产量的事实。但也有少数地区，把卫生、识字、文娱活动等等也都列入竞赛条件中，结果就影响了农民竞赛热情。农民说：“条条太多，记不住，办不到，趁早不竞赛。”
    三、以劳动模范为核心，组织地区性的连环竞赛，是造成群众性的竞赛运动的好办法。去年黑龙江省克山县民主村杨显庭模范互助组向外区互助组应战后就在本地挑战，带动全村百分之九十五的农民都参加了竞赛。但运动开始时，有些地区曾发生劳动模范“愿意比远不愿意比近”，领导干部也满足于劳动模范之间的挑战应战，没有发动广大农民参加，致使运动受到很大的限制。
    四、必须注意发动广大妇女参加竞赛。她们是改进农作技术，战胜天灾，争取丰收不可缺少的力量。吉林省汪清、延吉等十二个县，去年春耕中动员了五十三万多名妇女参加竞赛，她们担当选种、试种和踩格子等工作，及时完成了春耕播种工作。黑龙江省去春动员大批妇女参加抗旱工作，对克服旱灾发挥了很大作用。
    五、组织生产竞赛，必须和加强互助组的工作相结合。由于组织起来的农民是集体劳动，生产大都有一定的计划，参加生产竞赛比单干户有许多有利条件。经验证明，凡互助组基础较好的地区，生产竞赛运动就容易开展。许多地区去年在组织生产竞赛的同时，都整顿过互助组，这也对竞赛起了很大的推动作用。
    六、季节的检查和评比是推动竞赛运动不断向前发展的重要办法。吉林省榆树县去年春耕期间，发动农民“就地评比”，“边作边评”等，当场进行表扬和批评，使农民竞赛热情不断提高，全县百分之八十以上的农户去年都参加了竞赛运动。
