    Supporting the Government Administration Council's Decision on Unified Handling of Organ Production
    -- Reader Letters Overview
    Recently, many readers wrote to this newspaper supporting the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unified Handling of Organ Production."
    Reader Ai Gu wrote: "The Central People's Government Administration Council's 'Decision on Unified Handling of Organ Production' has been embraced by the vast majority of cadres and the masses. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we have seen many instances of illegal and undisciplined behavior, speculation and profiteering, and damage to the interests of the state and the people by organ production personnel. For example, 51.6% of the total business volume of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government's affiliated timber factory in 1951 was commercial speculation. The business scope of the goods yard of the Enterprise Company affiliated with the Municipal People's Government was originally stipulated to promote local products, but only 1.9% of the total business volume last year was for local products, and the rest was illegal business in furs, timber, iron, tires, kerosene, etc. The organ production of the Municipal Party Committee even used huge amounts of public funds to collude with private merchants in Tianjin to engage in illegal foreign import and export trade. This shows that organ production is easily exploited by the bourgeoisie. Cadres engaged in organ production are easily corrupted by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, the Government Administration Council's decision on unified handling of organ production is perfectly timed."
    Tang Fu of the Finance Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government wrote: "In the past revolutionary war, organ production played a certain positive role and solved many problems that had to be solved, which no one can deny. But after the revolution achieved nationwide victory, the disadvantages of organ production outweigh the advantages. Many facts revealed in the anti-corruption movement tell us that organ production has become a shelter for corruption and waste, and has fostered the corrupt and degenerate thinking of some people. Many illegal capitalists have shamelessly used this loophole to implement their tactics of 'pulling people over' and 'sending people in'. Many cadres were originally good, but after being responsible for organ production, they were hit by the bourgeoisie's 'sugar-coated bullets' because of their close contact with merchants, and they even degenerated to an incurable point. Therefore, I think the government's decision to unify the handling of organ production is correct and necessary."
    Tong Yan of the Sanitation Team of the Tanggu District People's Government in Tianjin wrote: "We now have sufficient strength to supply all the legitimate expenses of organs and troops; those who think that the state management of organ production will affect the expenses of organs are wrong. We warmly support this decision and hope that comrades engaged in organ production will support this decision with practical actions."

    拥护政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定
    ——读者来信综述
    最近许多读者给本报写信，拥护政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定。
    读者艾古来信说：“中央人民政府政务院‘关于统一处理机关生产的决定’获得了广大干部和群众的拥护。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们看到了许多机关生产人员的违法乱纪、投机倒把、损害国家人民利益的行为。例如石家庄市人民政府所属的木材厂，一九五一年经营总额的百分之五十一点六属于商业投机；该市人民政府所属企业公司货栈的经营范围，按规定原是推销土产，但在去年经营总额中，只有百分之一点九是经营土产，其余都是皮毛、木材、铁、轮胎、煤油等非法生意。该市市委的机关生产，还以巨额公款，在天津勾结私商，进行违法的国外进出口贸易。这说明机关生产容易被资产阶级钻空子。经营机关生产的干部，很容易为资产阶级思想所腐蚀。因此，政务院统一处理机关生产的决定是完全适时的。”
    绥远省人民政府财政厅唐富来信说：“在过去革命战争中，机关生产曾经起过它一定的积极作用，解决了不少必须解决的问题，这是谁也不能否认的。但在革命取得了全国胜利以后，机关生产已经是弊多利少了。反贪污运动中所揭发的许多事实告诉我们，机关生产已成为贪污浪费的防空洞，助长了某些人的腐化堕落思想。不少违法资本家利用这个空子，无耻地施行其‘拉过去’‘派进来’的伎俩。不少干部原来是很好的，但在负责机关生产后，因和商人往来甚密，而被资产阶级的‘糖衣炮弹’所命中，竟至堕落到不可救药的地步。因此，政府统一处理机关生产的决定，我认为是正确的，同时也是必要的。”
    天津市塘沽区人民政府清洁队彤彦来信说：“我们现在有足够的力量供给机关、部队的一切正当开支；那些认为机关生产归国家管理后会影响机关开支的想法，都是错误的。我们热烈地拥护这一决定，并希望从事机关生产的同志们，以实际行动来拥护这个决定。”
