Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published on February 8th a reader's criticism of our bureau's failure to carry out wage reform in accordance with regulations. We now reply separately as follows:

    (1) Disguised Wages Issue: Our so-called disguised wages actually include rent and utilities. Based on the actual situation, we initially stipulated an average amount for disguised wages per person and submitted it to the higher authorities for study. As a result, the higher authorities decided that utility fees (water and electricity) would remain under the original system and not be charged for the time being, while other disguised wages would be converted to 8.51 points and added to the current wage. This contradicts the criticism in the original text that we "did not include disguised wages in the current wage."

    (2) Point Value Calculation Issue: We used the new and old point value conversion for July, as stipulated by the higher authorities. The higher authorities did not stipulate that the average point value for July, August, and September should be used as the basic point value. The reader's criticism that we did not calculate according to the regulations of the higher authorities does not match the actual situation.

    (3) Plan Approval Issue: We followed the approval procedures stipulated by the higher authorities and did not directly report to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council for approval. The original criticism also does not correspond with the facts.

    However, there were indeed many shortcomings in our bureau's wage reform this time. These are mainly manifested in the lack of good policy publicity, integration with production, following the mass line, inconsistent technical standards (for staff), and failure to prepare adequately beforehand, etc. This is due to our serious bureaucratism. During the anti-corruption movement, some comrades already raised opinions on wages. We have decided to earnestly and responsibly resolve this issue after the movement. Peak Mine Bureau

    峰峰矿务局对工资改革问题的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报二月八日刊载了读者对我局不按规定进行工资改革的批评。现在分别答复如下：
    （一）变相工资问题：我们的所谓变相工资实际上包括房租、水电费。我们根据实际情况，初步规定了每人的变相工资的平均数，呈请上级研究。结果上级决定水电费仍维持原制度暂不收费，其他折合成八点五一分，加入现行工资内。这与原文“不把变相工资计算在现行工资之内”的批评不符合。
    （二）分值计算问题：我们是按上级规定以七月份新旧分值换算的。上级没有规定应以七、八、九三个月平均分值作为基本分值。读者批评我们不依上级规定计算，与实际情况不合。
    （三）方案批准问题：我们是按上级规定批准手续进行的，没有直接呈报中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。原批评也与事实不符合。
    但是，我局这次工资改革中的确是有很多缺点的。这主要表现在没有很好地宣传政策，结合生产，走群众路线，技术标准（职员）不统一，事先没有作好准备工作，等等。这是由于我们严重的官僚主义所致。在反贪污运动中，部分同志已经对于工资提出了意见。我们决定在运动后认真负责解决这个问题。　峰峰矿务局
