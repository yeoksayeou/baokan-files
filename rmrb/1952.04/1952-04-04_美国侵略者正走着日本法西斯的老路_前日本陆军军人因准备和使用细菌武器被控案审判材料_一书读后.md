    American Aggressors Are Following the Old Path of Japanese Fascists
    After Reading "Trial Materials of Former Japanese Army Servicemen Accused of Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons"
    Lou Bangyan
    Ten years ago, the Chinese people suffered the slaughter and poisoning of bacteriological weapons by Japanese fascist bandits. This is an old blood debt that is still fresh in our memories. Today, American imperialist robbers have completely embarked on the path of Japanese fascist bandits, using bacteriological weapons even more unscrupulously. Therefore, we should recognize the same bloodthirsty face of today's American aggressors by exposing the heinous crimes of the Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals of that time. We should learn from the support of the righteous Soviet Union's trial and handling of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, how to unite the peace-loving people of the world to fight unyieldingly to extinguish the flames of bacteriological warfare.
    Let us start with this old blood debt.
    (I) The Crimes of Japan in Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons
    From December 25 to 30, 1949, the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District in the city of Khabarovsk, Soviet Union, held a public trial of twelve Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, including Yamada Otozo, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army. During the trial, the criminal acts of Japanese fascist bandits in preparing and conducting bacteriological warfare were fully exposed.
    After the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese army occupied our Northeast. Between 1935 and 1936, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army, based on the secret order of Emperor Hirohito, established two secret organizations for preparing and conducting bacteriological warfare: the "Kwantung Army Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Department" and the "Kwantung Army Veterinary Disease Prevention Department," based on the bacteriological laboratory (under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Kwantung Army) presided over by Ishii Shiro, the "thinker" of bacteriological warfare. In 1941, when Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union, these two organizations changed to the secret designations of "Unit 731" and "Unit 100," respectively, and were presided over by Ishii Shiro and Wakamatsu Jiro. The scale of work of these two bacteriological units was very large. They possessed a large number of bacteriologists and various scientific and technical personnel who manufactured killing weapons. They established vast houses and places for manufacturing, testing, and storing bacteriological weapons near Harbin, Anda, and Changchun. They researched and cultivated astonishing quantities of plague, cholera, gangrene, anthrax, typhoid, paratyphoid, and other disease germs. They manufactured special weapons for spreading bacteria. They trained a large number of personnel skilled in the use of bacteriological weapons. In short, their purpose was to prepare for bacteriological warfare, mainly to deal with the Soviet Union and China. The "Bo" Unit 8604 in Guangzhou and the "Rong" Unit 1644 in Nanjing also had equipment for cultivating bacteria in large quantities. Later, new evidence was discovered that the Japanese invaders also had a bacteriological unit in Beijing, namely the "North China Jia 1855 Unit." Its "Bacteriological Weapon Cultivation Institute" was located in the current Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Office of the Temple of Heaven and the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute (now the address of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) next to the Beijing Library. In Nanjing, the Japanese invaders also established a large-scale factory for manufacturing bacteriological weapons under the guise of "Serum Vaccine Manufacturing Institute" at the foot of Jiuhua Mountain in the northern corner of the city. It has also been confirmed that the "Rong" Unit 1644 was stationed at the former Kuomintang Joint Logistics Headquarters on Zhongshan North Road.
    In order to test the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons, the Japanese invaders inhumanly used living people as experimental subjects. Most of these experimental subjects were patriotic elements who participated in the anti-Japanese movement in China, and some were Soviet citizens. In the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District of the Soviet Union, the defendant Nishi Toshihide confessed to such a tragic event: "In January 1945, near Anda Station at the shooting range of Unit 731, I personally saw Lieutenant Colonel Ikaru Tsunehisa, Chief of the Second Department of the unit, together with the unit's scientific personnel, Futaki, conduct gangrene infection experiments on ten Chinese prisoners of war. These ten captured Chinese were tied to pillars spaced ten to twenty meters apart, and then a bomb was detonated with electricity. As a result, all ten people were injured by shrapnel containing gangrene bacteria, and they all died painfully a week later." From 1940 to 1945, the five years that Unit 731 was stationed in the Pingfang Station area, twenty kilometers away from Harbin, at least three thousand people died from being infected with germs as a result of live experiments.
    The Chinese people not only suffered mass killings when the Japanese invaders were preparing for bacteriological warfare, but the Japanese invaders actually carried out cruel bacteriological warfare, using various germs to slaughter the Chinese people in many areas. The first bacteriological unit expedition was personally led by Ishii Shiro, and the result was that from October to December 1940, Japanese aircraft scattered cotton wool, wheat, flour, and millet mixed with fleas in Ningbo, Quzhou, Jinhua, Zhuji, Yangxi, and other places in Zhejiang Province. Soon, plague spread in these areas and nearby counties. The number of people who died from incurable infections ranged from a dozen or twenty to more than two hundred (Yiwu County). In 1941, Unit 731 again launched an expedition to Changde area in Hunan Province, dropping large quantities of rice, wheat grains, cotton wool, and porcelain jars from airplanes. The people of Changde also suffered from the plague as a result. It is estimated that about four hundred people died from the plague. In 1942, the Japanese invaders adopted another method of conducting bacteriological warfare, that is, in a certain war zone in Central China, taking advantage of the retreat of the Japanese army, they scattered germs such as paratyphoid and anthrax, as well as fleas as vectors of disease, causing the Chinese army that occupied this area to be infected with diseases. In addition, the Japanese invaders also used various methods to spread plague, typhoid, and other germs on the North China battlefield, and placed poison in wells and food to poison the Chinese people.
    In 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and advanced into the Northeast, giving the Japanese Kwantung Army a fatal blow, which forced Japanese imperialism to surrender unconditionally. On the eve of Japan's surrender, Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals destroyed various equipment and documents for manufacturing bacteriological weapons in order to eliminate evidence, which caused the Chinese people to suffer direct or indirect slaughter and disasters. Unit 731, stationed in the Pingfang Station area near Harbin, not only blew up all the killing bacteria factories in the area, but also brutally shot and killed more than a thousand Chinese workers in the factory collectively in order to eliminate human evidence. The Japanese invaders not only blew up the factory site and shot and killed the workers, but also inhumanly released a large number of rats infected with plague bacteria, causing plague to spread in nearby villages in the summer and autumn of the following year (1946). From June to September, there were almost daily deaths, with more than 1,200 deaths in Yifa Yuan Village and Hou Erdaogou Village alone. The people of Jujiayao Village in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, also suffered from the epidemic of diseases affecting both humans and animals in the same situation, because the plague and flea factory of Unit 731 was located in the village; today, with the prevention and control of the People's Government, plague, typhoid, and other epidemics have basically been eliminated, but various animal diseases have not yet been eradicated.
    The Chinese people will never forget the bloody hatred caused by the Japanese fascist bandits' inhuman bacteriological warfare to kill our Chinese people!
    (II) The Just Trial and Great Call of the Soviet Union
    The purpose of the Japanese fascists in preparing and using bacteriological weapons, as Ishii said during the period of Japan's launch of bacteriological warfare in 1945: "We will take the last weapon, including bacteriological weapons, to save the situation and turn it in favor of Japan." In fact, however, the preparation and use of bacteriological weapons failed to save Japan's disastrous situation. In that year, due to the Soviet Union's participation in the war, Japanese fascists had no choice but to surrender unconditionally. And many Japanese war criminals who prepared and used bacteriological weapons became "prisoners" of the Soviet Red Army.
    On December 16, 1949, the Military Prosecutor of the Primorsky Military District of the Soviet Union filed a public prosecution against Japanese war criminals Yamada Otozo and others for their criminal acts of preparing and using bacteriological weapons in the war of aggression against China. The indictment pointed out that the actual activities of Unit 731 and Unit 100 were "preparing and conducting bacteriological warfare," and it also pointed out that "Japanese warlords, in order to realize their criminal plans, did not hesitate to commit any crime, even to carry out inhuman experiments on living people, and brutally kill thousands of imprisoned people by forcibly infecting them with deadly bacteria." This was a righteous move to maintain peace and punish war criminals.
    The Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District of the Soviet Union held a public trial from December 25 to 30, 1949. During the trial, the defendants unanimously confessed to many serious atrocities and exposed the Japanese imperialists' plan for a large-scale war of aggression. The military tribunal affirmed in its verdict that "Japanese imperialists had prepared to use bacteriological weapons on a large scale when launching a war of aggression against the Soviet Union and other countries, thereby plunging mankind into a new sea of ​​disaster"; it also affirmed that the Japanese invaders "did not hesitate to take all criminal means in preparing for bacteriological warfare, killing thousands of Chinese citizens and Soviet citizens in carrying out criminal experiments using bacteriological weapons, and spreading various virulent epidemics among peaceful Chinese residents." The military tribunal sentenced twelve Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals to prison terms ranging from two to twenty-five years. This just trial gave the Japanese fascist war criminals who violated humanity and undermined international law the punishment they deserved. Not only did the Chinese people deeply feel this profound friendship of the Soviet people, but the peace-loving people of the world unanimously supported this severe sanction against war criminals.
    On February 1, 1950, the Soviet government, through its embassy, sent an identical note to our government and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to notifying the process of the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District's trial of twelve Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, the note also proposed that the Far Eastern Commission appoint a special international military tribunal to try the main organizers and instigators of bacteriological warfare revealed in the Khabarovsk trial, such as Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Lieutenant General Ishii Shiro, Lieutenant General Kitano Masazo, Major General Wakamatsu Jiro, and Lieutenant General Kasahara Yukio. Emperor Hirohito was "one of the main participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare"; Ishii Shiro organized and led Unit 731, and under his direct leadership, Unit 731 "carried out criminal research in the preparation of bacteriological warfare, especially using living people to conduct inhuman experiments"; Kitano Masazo also led Unit 731, and his crime was "participating in organizing a detachment that used bacteriological weapons to attack Chinese people in 1942, and participating in inhuman experiments using living people"; Wakamatsu Jiro led Unit 100, "engaged in manufacturing bacteriological weapons, and carried out destructive activities by infecting reservoirs, pastures, and livestock with anthrax bacteria, glanders bacteria, and other animal plague bacteria. The unit also conducted inhuman criminal experiments on living people"; Kasahara Yukio "led the preparation for anti-Soviet bacteriological warfare and directly participated in the plan for the application of bacteriological weapons during his term as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army from 1942 to 1945."
    Our government immediately agreed to the Soviet government's proposal to have the Far Eastern Commission appoint a special international military tribunal to try the five major Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals whose crimes were heinous. Our government's note also said: "The justice and merit of the Soviet government have been praised and supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially for the Chinese people who have suffered bacteriological poisoning by imperialist Japan, further deepening their indignation towards the fascist enemy and their gratitude towards the great Soviet ally." This is exactly what every just and kind Chinese person wants to say from the bottom of their hearts.
    The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have not responded to this great call from the Soviet government, even after repeated notes from the Soviet government. Are the ugly and ferocious true colors of the imperialists not clearly exposed before the peace-loving people of the world?
    (III) The U.S. Government Connives with and Colludes with Japanese Bacteriological Warfare Criminals, Preparing for Bacteriological Warfare
    Why did the U.S. imperialists not accept the Soviet proposal to establish an international special military tribunal to try the five major Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals headed by Emperor Hirohito? This is because it has painstakingly colluded with Japanese war criminals to actively prepare for and frantically carry out bacteriological warfare, which is now, in fact, completely confirmed.
    As early as before World War II, U.S. imperialists, like Japanese imperialists, had long intended to prepare and plan for bacteriological warfare. When the vast majority of countries in the world agreed to ratify the Geneva Protocol in 1925, which clearly stipulated the use of bacteriological weapons as illegal criminal acts, the U.S. and Japanese imperialists refused to ratify it. This clearly showed that the ruling class groups in these two countries already had the conspiracy to use barbarous bacteriological weapons when engaging in frantic wars of aggression. The Japanese invaders had already used this poisonous trick against our people more than a decade ago, and today the U.S. robbers are also stepping on this path of crime.
    MacArthur sent eighteen Japanese bacteriological "experts" and various materials for manufacturing bacteriological weapons to the United States in early 1946. In 1950, shortly after the Soviet government issued a note proposing the establishment of an international special military tribunal to try Japanese bacteriological war criminals, the then U.S. Secretary of the Army, Johnson, shamelessly declared that the United States was continuing to research and develop methods of bacteriological warfare. This work was mainly being carried out in the bacteriological laboratory of the Army Chemical Corps. The Army Chemical Corps spent more than 12 million U.S. dollars annually on bacteriological warfare research and experimentation. Like the Japanese fascist bandits, it inhumanly used living people for experiments. The so-called "inferior races" on the American continent became the victims of testing the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons under such circumstances. The enemy's own newspapers do not deny this fact, and even boast that their Army Chemical Corps has invented sixteen methods of using air and water to spread poisonous bacteria.
    Since last year, the U.S. invading army has even been using Bacteriological Landing Craft No. 1091 in Korea to carry out preparations for bacteriological weapons. This criminal bacteriological landing craft has visited Wonsan Port and Geoje Island, using captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army for experiments, abusing our two countries' beloved and heroic fighters. These murderous atrocities, as well as the frantic behavior of the U.S. invading army in scattering various insects capable of spreading bacteria in the front and rear of Korea and on our territory for more than two months, are inseparable from their connivance and protection of Japanese bacteriological war criminals, and are carried out in collusion with Japanese bacteriological war criminals. The three major bacteriological war criminals, Ishii Shiro, Kitano Masazo, and Wakamatsu Jiro, who have always been kept by the U.S. imperialists, went to Korea last year under the order of Ridgway's headquarters to conduct experiments on bacteriological warfare and submit a report on the plan for conducting bacteriological warfare in severe winter. It is under such shameless connivance and collusion that the disasters now befalling the peaceful people of Korea and China have been created.
    The Chinese people have always resolutely opposed all acts of aggression by imperialists. The Chinese people are especially indignant that the U.S. imperialists today blatantly disregard all human morality, colluding with the heinous war criminals such as Ishii, Kitano, and Wakamatsu, who led Unit 731 and Unit 100 in the Japanese Kwantung Army, and using the brutal and murderous experience of Unit 731 and Unit 100, have committed the towering crime of conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare. We are indignant, and we must use unyielding struggle to force all organizers and perpetrators of bacteriological warfare, past and present, to pay off the old and new blood debts and give them the most severe sanctions they deserve.
    (IV) We Will Definitely Be Able to Defeat the Aggressors Who Use Bacteriological Weapons
    The facts fully prove that the road taken by the U.S. robbers is the road taken by the Japanese invaders in the past. Japanese bacteriological war criminals have now become expert employees of the U.S. aggressors; all the methods of preparing and using bacteriological weapons of Unit 731 and Unit 100 of the Japanese Kwantung Army, including using living people as experimental subjects, scattering poisonous bacteria in retreating areas, and dropping various insects that spread bacteria from military aircraft, have now become the frantic atrocities of the U.S. aggressors who are vainly attempting to salvage an irrecoverable military defeat. The Japanese fascist bandits took a path of disastrous defeat in the past, then the path taken by the U.S. aggressors today must also be a path of disastrous defeat.
    The U.S. aggressors once arrogantly used their so-called "sea and air superiority" to scare us, but we were not scared. Its own paper tiger prototype has been completely exposed. Frantically conducting bacteriological warfare clearly shows the last struggle of the U.S. imperialist paper tiger, as the spokesman of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers affirmed in his statement: "What the U.S. aggressors cannot get by other means will never be obtained by extremely brutal bacteriological warfare... We firmly believe that the Chinese and Korean people, who have defeated the Japanese fascist bandits who used bacteriological weapons, will definitely be able to defeat the U.S. aggressors who use bacteriological weapons."
    Unconditionally prohibiting large-scale tools of human destruction, including atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons, and declaring the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal, is the unanimous demand of all peace-loving people in the world. The U.S. robbers, stained with blood debts, brought disaster to the peaceful people of Korea yesterday, and today they are bringing disaster to the peaceful people of China. In order to prevent the same disaster from befalling the peaceful people of the world tomorrow, we can only have all the peace-loving people of the world rise up together to stop this criminal behavior of the U.S. imperialists.
    There is an old lady who lives in a village near Pingfang Station on the outskirts of Harbin. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, her entire family of more than a dozen people was killed by the fleas containing plague bacteria released by Unit 731. Today, she sadly and indignantly says that the blood debts owed by the Japanese devils have not yet been paid, and we must never forgive the U.S. robbers for using the method of killing our whole family to kill the Chinese and Korean people. This expresses our determination to demand blood debts from all murderers.
    "Justice belongs to us, and victory will surely belong to us." We will surely win.

    美国侵略者正走着日本法西斯的老路
    “前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料”一书读后
    楼邦彦
    十年以前，中国人民曾遭受日本法西斯匪徒细菌武器的屠杀毒害，这是一笔记忆犹新的旧血债。今天美国帝国主义强盗已完全走上了日本法西斯匪徒的道路，变本加厉地使用细菌武器，因此我们应该在揭露当年日本细菌战犯的罪恶滔天的暴行中，来认识今天美国侵略者的同样一副嗜杀成性的真面貌，应该从支持正义的苏联对日本细菌战犯的审判和处理中，来获得怎样团结全世界爱好和平的人民不屈不挠地为扑灭细菌战毒焰而斗争的教训。
    让我们就从这一笔旧的血债说起。
    （一）日本准备和使用细菌武器的罪行
    一九四九年十二月二十五日至三十日，苏联伯力城的滨海军区军事法庭对前日本关东军总司令山田乙三以下的十二名日本细菌战犯进行公开审判。在审判中，日本法西斯匪徒准备并进行细菌战的罪恶行为全部暴露出来了。
    “九一八”事变后，日军侵占我东北，就在一九三五年到一九三六年间，日本参谋本部和陆军省根据裕仁天皇的密令，在细菌战“思想家”石井四郎所主持的细菌实验所（归日本关东军的建制）的基础上，建立了“关东军防疫给水部”和“关东军兽疫预防部”两个为准备和进行细菌战的秘密机关。一九四一年希特勒德国向苏联进攻，这两个机关就改采“第七三一部队”和“第一○○部队”的秘密番号，分别由石井四郎和若松次郎主持。这两个细菌部队的工作规模是非常宏大的，它们拥有大批制造杀人武器的细菌学家和各种科学技术人员，它们分别在哈尔滨、安达和长春附近建立为制造、试验并储存细菌武器的广大的房舍和场所，它们研究和培养惊人数量的鼠疫、霍乱、坏疽病、炭疽热病、伤寒、副伤寒及其他疾病的病菌，它们制造撒布细菌的特种武器，它们训练大量善于使用细菌武器的人员。总之，它们的目的是在准备细菌战，主要为了对付苏联和中国。在广州的“波”字第八六○四部队和在南京的“荣”字第一六四四部队也都同样有供大批培养细菌用的设备。后来发现新的证据，日寇在北京也有一个细菌部队，即“北支甲一八五五部队”，它的“细菌兵器培养所”设在现在的天坛中央防疫实验处和北京图书馆傍边的静生生物调查所（现在中国科学院地址）内。在南京，日寇也以“血清疫苗制造所”的伪装，在城内北角九华山下设立了一个制造细菌武器的规模很大的工厂，“荣”字第一六四四部队亦已证实驻在中山北路前国民党的联勤总部所在地。
    为了实验细菌武器的效能，日寇曾惨无人道地用活人来做实验的对象，这些实验的对象大部分是中国参加抗日运动的爱国分子，另外就是苏联公民。在苏联滨海军区军事法庭上，被告西俊英供认了这样的惨事：“一九四五年一月间，我曾在安达站附近第七三一部队打靶场上，亲自看过那里由该部队第二部部长碇常重中佐协同该部科学人员二木一起，在十个中国战俘身上进行坏疽病传染的实验。这十个被俘的中国人被绑在各距十至二十公尺的柱子上，然后就借电流爆发了一颗炸弹。结果这十个人都被带有坏疽菌的榴霰弹所炸伤，一星期后他们全都痛苦万分的死去了。”从一九四零年到一九四五年的五年之内，驻在距哈尔滨二十公里远的平房车站一带的第七三一部队，用活人实验的结果，染受病菌而致命者，至少有三千人。
    中国人民还不仅在日寇准备细菌战时遭受整批的杀害，日寇实际上也进行了残酷的细菌战，先后在好多地区用各种病菌来屠杀中国人民。日寇第一次远征细菌部队是由石井四郎亲自率领的，其结果就是一九四零年十月至十二月日本飞机在浙江省的宁波、衢州、金华、诸暨、阳溪等地撒布混杂跳蚤的棉絮、小麦、面粉和粟。不久，先后在这些地区及附近各县，鼠疫就蔓延起来了。各地因染受病菌不治死亡者，少则一二十人，多则竟达二百余人（义乌县）。一九四一年，第七三一部队又远征湖南省的常德地区，从飞机上投下大批稻谷、麦粒、棉絮和瓷罐，常德人民也就因此遭受了鼠疫的灾害，据估计因得鼠疫症致死者约有四百人。一九四二年，日寇又采取了另一种方式进行细菌战，即在华中某一战区内，乘日军退却之际，撒布副伤寒、炭疽热等病菌和作为病疫媒介物的跳蚤，使进占这一地区的中国军队传染到疾病。此外，日寇在华北战场上，也曾用各种方法撒布鼠疫、伤寒等病菌，并在井中、食物中置毒，来毒害中国人民。
    一九四五年，苏联对日宣战，进军东北，予日本关东军以致命的打击，才迫使日本帝国主义者无条件投降。在日本投降前夕，日本细菌战犯为了消灭罪证，就进行毁坏各种制造细菌武器的装备和文件，这又使中国人民直接或间接地遭受到屠杀和灾害。驻在哈尔滨附近平房车站一带的第七三一部队，不但把该区的杀人的细菌工厂全部炸毁了，而且为了消灭人证，又凶狠地把厂内的一千多中国工人集体枪杀了。日寇非但把厂地炸毁了，把工人枪杀了，并且还灭绝人性地放出了大批染有鼠疫细菌的老鼠，使附近一带屯子在翌年（一九四六年）夏秋两季流行着鼠疫，从六月至九月，几乎每天都有死亡，仅义发源村和后二道沟村就死了一千二百多人。黑龙江省的安达县鞠家窑村的人民，由于第七三一部队的鼠疫、跳蚤工厂即设在该村，亦在同样的情形下遭受到人畜流行病疫的灾害；今天在人民政府的防治下，鼠疫、伤寒等疫病基本上是消灭了，但各种畜疫则尚未根绝。
    中国人民永远不会忘记日本法西斯匪徒用惨无人道的细菌战来杀害我们中国人民所造成的血海深仇！
    （二）苏联的正义审判和伟大号召
    日本法西斯准备和使用细菌武器的目的，正如石井在一九四五年日本发动细菌战争的时期所说： “我们将要采取最后一种武器，包括细菌武器在内，以挽回局势，变为有利于日本。”然而在事实上，准备和使用细菌武器，却并未能挽救日本惨败的局势，就在这一年内，由于苏联的参战，日本法西斯不得不无条件投降了。而许多准备和使用细菌武器的日本战犯，也就变成苏联红军的“阶下之囚”了。
    一九四九年十二月十六日，苏联滨海军区军事检察官，对日本战犯山田乙三等十二人在侵华战争中曾准备和使用细菌武器的犯罪行为，提起公诉。起诉书指出，第七三一部队和第一○○部队的实际活动就是“准备和进行细菌战”，它又指出：“日本军阀为了实现自己的罪恶计划，不惜干出任何罪行，直至在活人身上进行惨无人道的实验，以及用强迫传染致命细菌办法惨杀了几千被囚禁的人。”这是一个为了维护和平、惩罚战犯的正义举措。
    苏联滨海军区军事法庭自一九四九年十二月二十五日至三十日举行了公开审判，在审判中各被告一致供认了许多罪恶深重的暴行，并揭穿了日本帝国主义者的大规模侵略战争的计划。军事法庭在判决书中肯定，“日本帝国主义者曾准备在对苏联及对其他国家开始侵略战争时，就大规模使用细菌武器，借此而把人类卷入新灾祸的苦海”；它又肯定，日寇“在进行准备细菌战争时不惜采取一切罪恶手段，在进行使用细菌武器的罪恶实验时杀害过成千数的中国公民和苏联公民，在中国和平居民中间散布过各种烈性疫症”。军事法庭对十二名日本细菌战犯分别判以二年到二十五年不等的徒刑。这一正义的审判给了违反人道、破坏国际公法的日本法西斯战犯们以应得的惩罚，不但中国人民深深地感到苏联人民的这一份深厚的友谊，世界的和平人民也一致拥护这个对战争罪犯的严正制裁。
    一九五零年二月一日，苏联政府通过大使馆以同样的照会送达我国政府和英美两国政府，照会中除通知关于滨海军区军事法庭审判十二名日本细菌战犯的经过外，还提议由远东委员会委任特别国际军事法庭来审判在伯力审判中被揭露的日本裕仁天皇、石井四郎中将医官、北野政藏中将医官、若松次郎少将兽医官、笠原行雄中将等细菌战的主要组织者和鼓励者。裕仁天皇是“准备细菌战主要参加者之一”；石井四郎曾组织并领导第七三一部队，在他的直接领导下，第七三一部队“进行了细菌战准备方面的罪恶研究，特别是用活人来作惨无人道的实验”；北野政藏亦曾领导第七三一部队，他的罪状是“于一九四二年曾参加组织那使用细菌武器进攻中国人的派遣队，并参加用活人进行惨无人性的实验”；若松次郎曾领导第一○○部队，“曾经从事制造细菌武器，并且用使贮水池、牧场与牲畜染上炭疽热细菌、鼻疽菌与其他兽瘟细菌的方法实现了破坏活动，该队也对活人进行了惨无人道的罪恶实验”；笠原行雄在“一九四二年至一九四五年任关东军参谋长期内，实现了对于反苏细菌战的准备工作的领导，并且直接参加应用细菌武器的计划”。
    我国政府立即同意了苏联政府的这一提议，即由远东委员会委任国际特别军事法庭来审判罪大恶极的日本五大细菌战犯；我国政府的照会又说：“苏联政府的正义和功绩，已得到了全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民的赞扬和拥护，尤其对于身受帝国主义日本的细菌毒杀的中国人民，更增深了对于法西斯敌人的愤慨及对于伟大苏联友邦的感激。”这正是每一个正义、善良的中国人从深心里所要说出的话。
    对于苏联政府的这个伟大的号召，英美两国政府，虽经苏联政府的再三照会，均未予置理。帝国主义者在世界和平人民面前，赤裸裸地暴露了狰狞凶残的真面目，这难道还不明显么？
    （三）美国政府纵容和勾结日本的细菌战犯，准备细菌战争
    美国帝国主义者为什么不接受苏联关于成立国际特别军事法庭来审判以裕仁天皇为首的日本五大细菌战犯的提议呢？这是因为它处心积虑地要勾结日本战犯来积极准备并疯狂进行细菌战，这在今天事实上，是已经完全证实了的。
    远在第二次世界大战以前，美帝国主义者，如同日本帝国主义者一样，早就蓄意作进行细菌战的准备和计划。当一九二五年世界绝大部分国家同意批准日内瓦议定书，把使用细菌武器明确规定为违法的犯罪行为的时候，美日两国帝国主义者却拒绝加以批准。这很明显地表示了这两个国家的统治阶级集团，早已有在疯狂地进行侵略战争时使用野蛮的细菌武器的阴谋。日寇在十多年前就已对我国人民下了这个毒手了，今天美国强盗也同样踏上了这条罪恶的道路。
    麦克阿瑟在一九四六年初即已把十八名日本细菌“专家”和各种制造细菌武器的材料送到了美国。一九五零年，在苏联政府发出提议成立国际特别军事法庭来审判日本细菌战犯的照会以后不久，当时的美国陆军部长詹逊恬不知耻地宣称：美国正在继续研究并发展细菌战的方法，这一工作主要是在陆军化学兵团的细菌实验室中进行着，陆军化学兵团每年就要花费一千二百多万美元来进行细菌战的研究和实验的工作，它也和日本法西斯匪徒一样，惨无人道地用活人来作实验，美洲大陆上的所谓“下等种族”就在这种情况下成为实验细菌武器效能的牺牲品了。敌人自己的报刊也并不否认这个事实，而且还夸耀说，他们的陆军化学兵团业已发明十六种利用空气和水来散布毒菌的方法。
    从去年起，美国侵略军更在朝鲜以第一○九一号细菌登陆艇来进行准备细菌武器的工作，这个罪恶的细菌登陆艇曾先后到过元山港和巨济岛，以中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的被俘人员来做实验，虐害我们两国可爱的英勇战士。这些杀人的暴行以及两个多月来美国侵略军在朝鲜的前线后方和在我国领土撒布能传布细菌的各种昆虫的疯狂行为，和他们对日本细菌战犯的纵容与庇护是完全分不开的，是他们在和日本细菌战犯的勾结下进行的。一直为美国帝国主义者所豢养着的石井四郎、北野政藏和若松次郎三大细菌战犯，去年奉了李奇微总部之命，自日本前往朝鲜进行细菌战的实验，并提出关于在严冬进行细菌战的计划的报告。就在这种无耻的纵容和勾结下，造成了现在落在朝鲜和中国和平人民头上的灾难。
    中国人民一向坚决反对帝国主义者的一切侵略行为，中国人民尤其愤恨美帝国主义者今天竟悍然不顾一切人类道德，勾结罪大恶极的当年在日本关东军中领导第七三一和第一○○部队的石井、北野、若松等战犯，利用第七三一和第一○○部队的残暴杀人经验，干出了进行大规模细菌战的滔天罪行。我们愤恨，我们一定要用不屈不挠的斗争，迫使一切过去和现在的细菌战的组织者和实行者把旧的和新的血债还清，予以应得的最严厉的制裁。
    （四）我们一定能够打败使用细菌武器的侵略者
    事实完全证明：美国强盗所走的道路就是日寇当年所走的道路。日本的细菌战犯，今天都成了美国侵略者的专家雇员；日本关东军第七三一和第一○○部队的一切准备和使用细菌武器的方法，包括把活人当做实验对象、在溃退地区撒布含毒细菌和从军用飞机上撒下传布细菌的各种昆虫等，今天都成了美国侵略者妄图挽救不可挽救的军事惨败的疯狂暴行。当年日本法西斯匪徒所走的是一条惨败的道路，那末今天美国侵略者所走的必然也是一条惨败的道路。
    美国侵略者曾狂妄地以所谓“海空优势”来吓唬过我们，我们倒并没有被吓倒，它自己的纸老虎原形却完全戳穿了。疯狂地进行细菌战很明显地表示了美帝国主义纸老虎的最后挣扎，正如中国人民志愿军司令部发言人在发表谈话中所肯定的：“美国侵略者用其他方法所不能得到的东西，用极端残暴的细菌战也是绝不能得到的。……我们坚信，曾经打败过使用细菌武器的日本法西斯匪徒的中朝人民，一定能够打败使用细菌武器的美国侵略者。”
    无条件禁止包括原子武器和细菌武器在内的大规模毁灭人类的工具，并宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯，是全世界一切爱好和平的人民的一致要求。血债累累的美国强盗昨天把灾难落在朝鲜和平人民的头上，今天又把灾难落在中国和平人民的头上，为了使这同样的灾难明天不会落在世界和平人民的头上，只有让我们全世界一切爱好和平的人民一致奋起，来制止美帝国主义者的这种罪恶的行为。
    有这么一位老太太，她住在哈尔滨市郊的平房车站附近的村子里。当日寇投降时，她全家十几口人为第七三一部队所放出的含有鼠疫细菌的跳蚤所杀害。今天她悲愤地说，日本鬼子欠下的血债尚未还清，我们绝不能饶恕美国强盗用杀害我们全家的办法来杀害中朝人民。这正表达了我们一定要向一切杀人犯讨还血债的决心。
    “正义是属于我们的，胜利也必然是属于我们的。”我们一定胜利。
