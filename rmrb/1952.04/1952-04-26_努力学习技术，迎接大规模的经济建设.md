    Work Hard to Learn Technology and Greet Large-Scale Economic Construction
    Textile Industry Model Worker Hao Jianxiu
    Last year, with the help of the Communist Party, the factory administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, I created the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." After this fine spinning method was promoted in cotton mills across the country, the amount of roller waste in each factory was greatly reduced, saving the country a considerable amount of value in increased production and savings. I was very happy about this. However, I often think that the country's large-scale construction will start soon, and our production must be greatly improved. I feel that my contribution to the country is too small, and what I know is too little. Now, many sisters have learned the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," and the roller waste they produce is even less than mine. For example, Zhang Shugong in our factory recently achieved an average record of only 0.072 percent roller waste in six months, greatly exceeding my record of 0.25 percent. When I see my sisters creating new records higher than mine, I am really happy because this can increase production and save even more for the country. I must learn from them diligently.

    Now, the Party and higher authorities are cultivating me, asking me to learn both the maintenance of textile machines and to improve my education. After more than a month of study, I have learned how to sweep the machines in terms of maintenance, and I am almost finished learning how to repair the small flat car (repair). In terms of education, I am currently studying the courses for higher primary school. I have encountered difficulties in my studies. For example, when learning maintenance, I cannot move many of the machine parts. However, I think, compared to our volunteer soldiers fighting the American imperialists in Korea, can this be considered a difficulty? This gives me the courage to overcome it. In the learning process, I pay attention to two things: one is to use my brain more, and the other is to be diligent with my hands. When the master teaches me to learn each operation, and when I watch the master operate, even if it is to remove or install a screw, I must think carefully or ask the master, "Why do you do this?" "How can it be done better, faster, and more efficiently?" It is not enough to just use your brain; often, even if you remember it in your head, you still cannot do it well when you do it with your hands. Therefore, I try to find more opportunities to do it myself. In addition to what the master asks me to do, when I see the master smoking or going out for a while, I quickly do it myself for a while. If there is a problem, I ask him when the master comes back. In addition to learning technology and culture, I also pay attention to learning politics. Now, I read the "People's Daily" and the "Worker's Daily" every day. Reading the newspaper is a good way to learn, which can improve both politics and culture, and I will never interrupt it in the future.

    I cannot become detached from the sisters in the workshop just because I am studying. In addition to going back to check the machines for one or two hours every day, I also often take the time to go back to the workshop. When I see that my sisters have new creations, I go to learn from them. I also often seek help from the Party and Communist Youth League branch secretaries, trade union cadres, and worker sisters in the workshop to solve some problems. In the maintenance department, I also unite well with the masters and learn technology from the masters with my heart; the masters also patiently teach me. We are all very united. As we welcome our own holiday—the "May Day" International Labor Day—I assure the Party and the higher authorities: I must study hard, unite well with everyone, and do more for the country in our great construction.

    努力学习技术，迎接大规模的经济建设
    纺织工业劳动模范  郝建秀
    去年，在共产党和工厂行政方面、工会、青年团的帮助下，我创造了“郝建秀工作法”。这个细纱工作法在各地的棉纺厂推广以后，各厂的皮辊花都减少了很多，给国家增产节约了不少价值。我自己非常高兴。可是，我常常想起国家的大建设很快要开始了，我们的生产还得大大提高，我就觉得我对国家的贡献太少，我自己知道的会的东西太少了。现在，许多姐妹们学习了“郝建秀工作法”以后，皮辊花出的比我还少了许多，像我们工厂里的张淑宫，最近六个月皮辊花的平均纪录只有百分之零点零七二，大大超过了我的纪录——百分之零点二五。我看到姐妹们创造出比我的高的新纪录时，我真高兴。因为这可以给国家增产节约更多的东西。我一定要好好地向她们学习。
    现在，党和上级培养我，要我一面学纺织机器的保全，一面学文化。经过一个多月的学习，在保全方面我已经学会了扫车，小平车（修理）也差不多学会了。在文化方面，我正在学高小的课程。在学习中，我也曾遇到困难。比如，学保全时，有许多机件我就搬不动。可是，我想，比起咱们志愿军在朝鲜和美帝国主义打仗，这还能说是困难吗？这样我就有勇气来克服它了。在学习过程中，我注意了两件事情，一个是多动脑子，一个是勤动手。老师傅教我学每一个操作，和我看老师傅操作时，那怕是去一个螺丝钉或上一个螺丝钉，我都要用心想或者问老师傅：“为什么要这样做？”“怎么样才能做得更好、更快、更省劲？”光是动脑子还不成；常常脑子里记住了，动手做时还做不好。所以，我就想法多找机会自己动手做。除了老师傅指定我做的以外，看见老师傅吸烟或者有事出去一会儿，我就赶忙自己去做一会儿。有了问题，等老师傅回来就问他。除了学技术和文化，我还注意自己学政治。现在，我每天都要看“人民日报”和“工人日报”。看报是个很好的学习，又能提高政治又能学习文化，以后我决不间断。
    我不能因为自己去学习，就脱离了车间的姐妹们。除了每天要回去看一两小时的车以外，我还常抽空回车间去。看见姐妹们有新的创造，我就去向她们学习。我还常找车间的党和青年团的支部书记、工会干部和工人姐妹们帮助我解决一些问题。在保全部，我也很好地和老师傅团结，用心地向老师傅学技术；老师傅也很耐心地教我。我们大家都团结得很好。在迎接我们自己的节日——“五一”国际劳动节时，我向党和上级保证：我一定要努力学习，好好和大家团结，在我们的大建设中给国家做更多的事情。
