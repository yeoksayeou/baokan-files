    Manager of the Mentougou Branch of the Coal Construction Company's Self-Criticism Regarding the Accident Where a Worker Was Crushed to Death

    Editor: The People's Daily's criticism on February 3rd regarding the accident at our company's No. 1 Coal Plant, where a worker was crushed to death, is correct. At the West Xin Mine No. 1 Coal Plant, which is under our company's jurisdiction, the narrow plant area and excessively high coal piles posed a constant threat to worker safety during loading. According to statistics, 15 workers were injured due to this cause in the past two years, last year and the year before. However, I still did not pay enough attention to this situation and harbored complacency. When assigning tasks, I did not implement the spirit of the higher authorities' emphasis on safety and did not conduct thorough on-site inspections, only making general and perfunctory arrangements. This fully demonstrates my serious bureaucratic work style (Note: The Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau has given a public warning as a disciplinary measure for this). I must correct this in the future.

    Currently, the aftermath of worker Li Wenming's death has been handled by the relevant departments. To ensure that workers can work under safe conditions, the following measures have been determined through various studies: (1) Starting from February 4th, our company and the station loading and unloading supply cooperative will each send cadres to guide and supervise the coal piling work within the plant, so that the coal piles always maintain a safe slope; (2) An additional lighting fixture will be installed in the plant; (3) A joint meeting consisting of 15 people, including the responsible persons and cadres from our company and relevant units, will be established to determine fixed meeting dates and to study and resolve worker safety issues and loading and unloading methods at any time.

    煤建公司门头沟支公司经理
    对砸死工人事故的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报二月三日对我公司第一煤厂发生砸死工人事故的批评是对的。我公司所属西新井第一煤厂，因厂地窄小、煤堆过高，在装车时，随时危及工人安全。据统计，去年和前年两年中，因此受伤的已达十五人。但我对这种情况依然未加重视，存在着麻痹思想。我在布置工作时，没有把上级注意安全工作的精神贯彻下去，也不到现场深入检查，只作了一般性的草率的传达布置。这充分表现了我的严重的官僚主义作风（按：北京市人民政府工商局为此已给予当众警告处分），今后我一定要改正。
    现在，工人李文明的善后问题，已由有关方面处理。为使工人能在安全条件下进行工作，经各方面研究，已规定了下列办法：（一）二月四日起，我公司和车站装卸供应社各派干部在厂内指导监督放堆工作，使煤堆经常保持安全坡度；（二）厂内再增设照明灯一盏；（三）我公司与有关单位的负责人、干部共十五人组成联席会议，确定固定会期，随时研究解决工人安全问题及装卸办法。
