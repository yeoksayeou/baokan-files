    New Atmosphere in Liu Shuang'an Village, Gaotang
    Last autumn, I returned to my hometown, Liu Shuang'an Village in Gaotang County, Pingyuan, to recuperate from illness. I saw the long-separated homeland was full of vitality, which made me very excited. Over the past two years, the villagers have worked hard to learn culture, and many people can now write simple diaries and read newspapers. The ancient temple at the east end of the village has now been converted into a school building with twenty rooms. More than one hundred male and female farmers are studying inside. They are very enthusiastic and have all made personal study plans. In the morning, before dawn, the children gather on the new school building square for exercises. At night, you can hear the school bell ringing in the fields. At about nine o'clock, school is over, and the silent plain echoes with the song "Valiantly, with heads held high," which is the song sung by the village militia during training. At this time, people will feel that the power of our motherland's people is truly invincible.
    The villagers have greatly improved their political consciousness in the reading group. All the villagers are happy with "Korean Correspondence." My seventy-year-old father always listens quietly as I read the newspaper. Once, I read "Man of Honor," and the old man shed tears for the heroic and moving deeds. The volunteers have long become the "most beloved people" in the hearts of the farmers. Wang Shuhua, a family member of a volunteer soldier, said in a letter to her husband: "I was a labor model in the whole district last year. I promise you that I will strive to be a labor model in the whole county this year. I hope you will also kill a few more American aggressors and strive for even greater achievements." Now, eighty peasant households in the village have subscribed to "Increase Production and Practice Economy Plans," and are vigorously striving for a new bumper harvest.　Liu Jiarong

    高唐刘双安庄的新气象
    去年秋天，我因病回到故乡平原高唐县刘双安庄去休养，我看到久别的故乡气象万千，令人十分兴奋。全村农民两年来努力学习文化，不少人已能写简单的日记和读报纸了。村庄东头那座古老的神庙，如今已经改建成一所有二十间房屋的校舍。有一百多个男女农民在里面学习。他们情绪非常高，都订出了个人学习计划。早晨，天还没亮，孩子们便已集聚在新校舍广场上作体操了。夜晚在田野也能听到学校上课时的钟声。到九点钟光景，学校下课了，静寂的平原上传来了“雄赳赳、气昂昂”的歌声，这是各村民兵练兵时唱的歌子。这时，人们就会感受到咱们祖国人民的力量真是不可战胜的。
    全村农民在读报组里，大大提高了政治觉悟。全村农民都欢喜“朝鲜通讯”。我的七十岁的老父总是静静地听我读报。一次我读了“荣誉的人”，老人为那英勇的感人肺腑的事迹淌下眼泪。志愿军在农民心中早已成为“最可爱的人”了。志愿军军属王淑华在写给她丈夫的信上说：“我去年当了全区的劳动模范，我向你保证今年争取当全县的劳动模范，希望你也多杀几个美国侵略军，争取功上加功”。现在，村中八十户农民都订了“增产节约计划”，生气勃勃地要争取一个新的丰收。　刘嘉荣
