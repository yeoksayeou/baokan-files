A Salute to the Chinese Working Class
Hong Chun-cheol, Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China

We, the Korean People's Delegation to China, feel infinitely excited and honored to be able to celebrate International Labor Day, "May Day," in Beijing, the capital of our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China.

Following the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, the heroic working class of the People's Republic of China, which has created great miracles in world history, has achieved brilliant victories in its construction to lead its motherland onto the road of prosperity and strength.

During our nearly four-month visit to various parts of China, we have seen the great Chinese working class mocking the so-called "blockade" of American imperialism, completely washing away the semi-colonial dependence of old China's economy, and solemnly marching forward towards the early entry into socialism.

People are holding high the banner of the wise Mao Zedong, letting the old, decadent, collapsing, and dying things go, and constantly growing new and just things; under the new system of people's democratic dictatorship, factory chimneys stand tall, emitting long plumes of smoke from increased production, and the vast, fertile land is full of grains and fruits, everywhere brimming with the beautiful life of people's happiness and freedom.

The unprecedented unity and solidarity have further strengthened and enhanced the great Chinese people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism; in order to lead China onto the brilliant road of industrialization, I have personally witnessed hundreds of millions of working people unfolding a struggle for peaceful construction and for strengthening national defense with incomparably strong confidence. The power of the Chinese working class, bravely advancing for the victory of this struggle, is endless, and this great power has converged into a torrent of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the home and the country. This torrent is a powerful guarantee for defending peace.

For example: The workers of Kailuan Coal Mine shouted, "Producing one more ton of coal is equal to eliminating one more American devil!" The workers of various state-run cotton mills in Qingdao shouted, "Spinning one more thread is equal to extracting one more sinew from the American aggressors!" "Weaving one more bolt of cloth is equal to peeling one more layer of skin from the American robbers!" Under these slogans, they have created many new records and continue to increase production on this basis.

These many slogans and actions fully demonstrate that the Chinese working class has been and is supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people and army with increased production, showing the Chinese people's heroic and fearless firm will to strike at the ferocious flames of imperialist aggression.

We have also seen that the unprecedented large-scale land reform movement carried out in rural areas throughout China has achieved great victories. In the rural areas where land reform has been implemented, the feudal land ownership system has been eliminated, the peasants have become the masters of the land, and are launching patriotic production increase movements and resisting America and aiding Korea actions with unparalleled enthusiasm. Their political awareness is rapidly increasing, and their living standards are rising steadily, showing the infinitely bright and happy prospects of the new Chinese peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

Today, although the workers and peasants of Korea are in a difficult war environment, they are able to break through numerous difficulties and strive with the greatest strength for the final victory of the just Fatherland Liberation War.

In 1951, the labor productivity in the northern half of our motherland increased by 333 percent compared to 1946, which was also aroused by anger at the American imperialist aggression, and this is proof of the great power of the Korean working class.

Our delegation to China will tell the Korean people and the Korean People's Army about the brilliant achievements of the working people of the new China in large-scale construction and the movement to resist America and aid Korea, so that they can more deeply understand how the growth and strength of our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China, has become a strong barrier for the cause of peace in the Far East and Asia.

The Chinese working people have today become the masters of the country, and therefore, with infinite pride, regard labor as an honor, and advance, holding high the banner of increasing production, practicing economy, resisting America, and aiding Korea.

The Korean people will respond to the selfless and great assistance of the people of their close brotherly country in the movement to resist America and aid Korea with heroic struggles and great victories.

Dear Chinese brothers and sisters! The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the Korean people, and the victory of the Korean people is also the victory of the Chinese people. The victory of the Korean and Chinese people is the common victory of all peace-loving people in the world. Let us and the working people of the world unite more closely, strengthen our fighting forces, and advance courageously towards the final victory against the American aggressors! Forward!

    向中国工人阶级致敬
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长  洪淳哲
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，这次能在伟大的邻邦中华人民共和国的首都——北京，来迎接“五一”国际劳动节日，感到无限的兴奋和光荣。
    继伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命以后，在世界历史上创造了伟大奇迹的中华人民共和国英雄的工人阶级，为使自己的祖国走上繁荣富强的道路所进行着的建设，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。
    我们在将近四个月的期间里，访问了中国各地，看到了伟大的中国工人阶级，都在嘲笑着美帝国主义的所谓“封锁”，将旧中国经济上的半殖民地的隶属性全部清洗出去，为了早日进入社会主义而庄严地向前迈进。
    人们高举着英明的毛泽东的旗帜，让旧的腐朽的崩溃死亡，新的、正义的不断成长；在人民民主专政的新制度之下，工厂的烟囱林立高耸，冒着增产的长烟，广阔无边的肥沃的土地上结满了五谷百果，到处洋溢着人民幸福自由的美好生活。
    历史上从未有过的统一与团结，更加加强和提高了伟大的中国人民的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神；为了使中国走上工业化的灿烂大道，我亲眼看到亿万的劳动人民正以无比坚强的信心，展开着和平建设和为加强国防建设而斗争着。为这个斗争的胜利而勇敢前进的中国工人阶级的力量是无穷无尽的，这伟大的力量汇成了抗美援朝保家卫国的巨流。这巨流是保卫和平的强有力的保证。
    例如：开滦煤矿的工人同志们，高呼着“多出一吨煤就等于多消灭一个美国鬼子！”青岛各国营棉厂的工人同志们，高呼着“多纺一根纱就等于多抽美国侵略者一根筋！”“多织一匹布等于多剥美国强盗一张皮！”他们就在这些口号之下，创造出了许许多多的新纪录，在这样的基础上继续不断地提高着产量。
    这许多口号和行动，都充分地说明了中国的工人阶级已经和正在用增加生产来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民，显示了中国人民英雄无畏的打击帝国主义侵略凶焰的坚强意志。
    我们又看到了：在中国各地农村所进行的空前大规模的土地改革运动，业已取得了巨大的胜利。在实行过土地改革的农村中，已经消灭了封建的土地所有制，农民们都做了土地的主人，正以无比兴奋的热情展开了爱国丰产运动和抗美援朝行动。他们的政治觉悟飞速提高，生活水平蒸蒸日上，显示着在中国共产党领导下的新中国农民底无限光明幸福的远景。
    今天，朝鲜的工人、农民虽处在艰苦战争的环境中，但是却能突破重重的困难，以最大的力量为了正义的祖国解放战争的最后胜利而奋斗着。
    一九五一年，我们祖国北半部的劳动生产率，比一九四六年增加了百分之三百三十三，这也是由对美帝国主义侵略的愤怒而奋起的，这是朝鲜工人阶级的伟大力量的证明。
    我们访华代表团要把新中国劳动人民在大规模建设中，和抗美援朝运动中的辉煌成就，告诉给朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，让他们更深刻地了解我们伟大邻邦中华人民共和国的成长壮大，是怎样成为远东和亚洲和平事业的坚强屏障。
    中国的劳动人民今天已经做了国家的主人，因此就以无限的骄傲心情，视劳动为荣誉，高举起增产节约抗美援朝的旗帜前进。
    朝鲜人民将会以英勇的斗争和巨大的胜利来回答自己亲密的兄弟国家人民在抗美援朝运动中的忘我无私的伟大援助。
    亲爱的中国兄弟姊妹们！中国人民的胜利就是朝鲜人民的胜利，朝鲜人民的胜利也是中国人民的胜利。朝中两国人民的胜利乃是全世界爱好和平人民的共同胜利。让我们和全世界劳动人民更加紧密地团结起来，壮大我们的战斗力量，向着反抗美国侵略者最后胜利的目标勇猛前进，前进！
