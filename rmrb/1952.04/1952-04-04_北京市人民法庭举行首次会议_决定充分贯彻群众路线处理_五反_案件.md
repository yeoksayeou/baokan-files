    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing People's Court for handling cases of illegal industrial and commercial households in the "Five-Anti" movement held its first meeting on April 3rd. It was presided over by Judge Wang Feiran, and attended by the deputy judges and all judges, as well as the presiding judges of the sub-courts in various districts and suburban districts. The meeting discussed the work of the People's Court and trial methods. The meeting decided that the work of the People's Court must fully implement the mass line. Before a verdict is reached in each case, the opinions of the employees of the factory or store, informants, inspection teams, and other relevant personnel must be widely sought to ensure that the details of each case are thoroughly investigated. When handling cases, the general approach should be to adopt a batch-by-batch collective sentencing format. In order to handle the daily work of the People's Court, the meeting decided to immediately establish an office for the People's Court. The first sentencing will be held in the near future.
