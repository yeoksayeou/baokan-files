    Regions Should Cooperate with Each Other in the Work of Recovering赃款 and Deciding Cases
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have entered the stage of recovering赃款, deciding cases, and handling problems. This is an arduous and complex struggle. Many embezzlers and thieves have scattered their赃款 and赃物 in other places; many witnesses and physical evidence that can prove their criminal behavior are also in other places. At this time, if any unit wants to recover赃款 and obtain conclusive evidence to decide cases, it must conduct thorough investigations in other places. If the investigation work is to achieve results quickly, it must obtain the assistance of local leading organs and various working organs. Therefore, mutual assistance between different regions in this work has become an important condition for completing the task.
    In this regard, the organs and units in various regions have generally done so, thus providing many conveniences for the work of recovering赃款 and deciding cases. However, some units have not done so. On April 8, the Shanzhou Branch of the China Grain Company sent a telegram to the Yangzhou Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, requesting the Yangzhou Industry and Commerce Bureau to assist in investigating the situation of a certain embezzler depositing赃款 in a certain merchant in Yangzhou. Obviously, the Yangzhou Industry and Commerce Bureau had a full obligation to assist in this work. However, that very evening, the Yangzhou Industry and Commerce Bureau replied to the Shanzhou Branch of the China Grain Company, saying that this matter was "none of my business" and refused to assist. This situation is not an isolated case now. Some organs even adopt the erroneous attitude of "sweeping the snow in front of one's own door" when people from other places come to arrest criminals, refusing to provide any assistance, preferring to let criminals escape the law and continue to harm the country and the people. These comrades do not regard revolutionary work as a unified whole, regarding the work undertaken by others as revolutionary work that is inseparable from their own work, but are short-sighted, only seeing the little things under their noses, and thus cannot see how serious difficulties and adverse consequences their erroneous attitude will cause to the entire work of recovering赃款 and deciding cases.
    In order to do a good job in recovering赃款 and deciding cases quickly, and strive for the complete victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, it is necessary for us to raise this issue. All regions and units should conduct an in-depth examination to see if there are similar departmentalism phenomena in their region or unit in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. If such phenomena are found, necessary education and criticism should be carried out on the cadres, and this phenomenon should be corrected in a timely manner, the revolutionary spirit of mutual assistance should be promoted, and the sense of political responsibility should be strengthened, so as to ensure the smooth completion of the work of recovering赃款 and deciding cases nationwide.

### 各地区在追赃定案工作中应该互相协助

    各地区在追赃定案工作中应该互相协助
    “三反”、“五反”运动已进入追赃定案和处理问题的阶段。这是一个艰苦、复杂的斗争。很多贪污盗窃分子，把赃款赃物分散在外地；能够证明他们的犯罪行为的人证物证，也有许多是在外地。这时候，任何一个单位要想追出赃款，获得定案的真凭实据，都必须到外地进行切实的调查。而调查工作要想迅速获得结果，就必须取得当地领导机关和各种工作机关的协助。所以，不同地区在这一工作中的互相帮助，就成了完成任务的重要条件。
    在这一方面，各地区的机关单位一般地都是这样做了的，因而使追赃定案工作取得了许多方便。但是，也有一些单位没有这样做。四月八日，中国粮食公司陕州分公司给扬州市人民政府工商局发了个电报，请扬州市工商局协助调查某贪污分子汇存扬州某商号赃款的情况。显然，扬州市工商局完全有义务协助进行这一工作。但是，就在当晚，扬州工商局却这样答复了中国粮食公司陕州分公司，说这事“与我无关”，拒绝协助。这种情形现在并不是个别的。有的机关，甚至在外地有人来逮捕罪犯时，也采取了“各扫门前雪”的错误态度，拒绝给以任何助力，宁让罪犯逍遥法外，继续危害国家和人民。这些同志不是把革命工作看作统一的整体，把别人所担负的工作也看成和自己的工作密不可分的革命工作，而是目光如豆，只看见自己鼻子底下的一点事情，因而看不见自己所采取的错误态度会给整个追赃定案工作造成多么严重的困难和不良的后果。
    为了把追赃定案工作迅速做好，争取“三反”、“五反”斗争的彻底胜利，我们有必要把这一问题提出来。各地区各单位都应该深入地检查一下，看本地区、本单位在“三反”、“五反”运动中有无类似的本位主义现象。如果发现这类现象，就应该对干部进行必要的教育和批评，并及时纠正这种现象，发扬革命的互助精神，加强政治责任心，以保证追赃定案工作在全国范围内顺利完成。
