The Plan to Build the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
Fully Conforms to the Wishes of the Working People

    Editor: I am from Gong'an County in the Jingjiang area of Hubei Province. I have been to all parts of the Jingjiang area. Like everyone who grew up in the Jingjiang area, I have tasted the bitterness of suffering from floods. Therefore, I feel that every aspect of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project plan conforms to the wishes of the working people.
    In the eyes of the people in our area, floods are simply worse than poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. People worry about it every year. When floods breach the dikes, the grain and houses of the people in the Jingjiang area are all submerged. Even if the dikes are not breached by chance, from the spring floods to the autumn floods, water may pour into the fields from Taipingkou and other places at any time, and people are always in danger of being forced to flee famine. In the year of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Jingjiang Dike broke once, and the Jingjiang area became a vast expanse of water. The following year, when the water receded, good fields became beaches, and manors became riverbeds, but the reactionary Kuomintang government did not care about the lives of the people at all. After the people suffered from the flood, the landlords and despots made a fortune. In our area, there are weirs enclosed by dikes, and each weir has a "flood control director." Only landlords and despots can be this "director." Sometimes, in order to protect their own weir from being submerged, these landlords and despots secretly send their henchmen to puncture other people's weirs. In short, the "flood control director" has ways to make money when breaching the dike, and ways to make money when not breaching the dike. It is always the common people who suffer and repair the dikes.
    Since liberation, the People's Government has led the people to control floods, and the Jingjiang Dike has not been breached again. This year, the Central People's Government has decided to build the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project to permanently control floods. This is a great joy for the people of the Jingjiang area. Now the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has started in full swing. With the help of the government, the people in the flood diversion area are moving to safe areas to settle down and produce in a planned way. What an enlightened measure! When I saw the report on the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, I laughed from the bottom of my heart. I think the people in the Jingjiang area must also be laughing, because people will feel that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people in the Jingjiang area will forever get rid of the threat of floods and move towards a richer and happier life!

    After the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is completed, the Dongting Lake granary will be even richer

    Editor: I am a military dependent and have lived on the shores of Dongting Lake for decades. For decades, I have lived in the disasters of floods and droughts every year. After liberation, we were given land, and the government led us to prevent floods, fight droughts, and prevent insects. We have had bumper harvests year after year. But I think about one thing day and night: what method can be used to block the floods so that the fertile land on the shores of Dongting Lake will never be flooded? Recently, after seeing the regulations of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, I was extremely happy. I sincerely thank the People's Government and the Communist Party. The People's Government and the Communist Party led the people to harness the Huai River, and now they are leading the people to harness the Yangtze River, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River and the harvest of millions of acres of farmland, and protecting the smooth flow of Yangtze River shipping.
    Now the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has started in full swing. I am determined to do many things for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. I want to mobilize the villagers to participate in this project with the greatest effort. I am a military dependent, and I must take the lead in participating in this project, because I know that only by doing a good job in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project can there be no floods forever, and the Dongting Lake granary will always be our own.

    The Great Mao Zedong Era Realizes the Expectations of the People of the Two Lakes

    Editor: China's second huge water conservancy project—the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project—has started in full swing. During the period of reactionary rule, water control work in the Jingjiang section of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River had also been heard of. At that time, the reactionary rulers extorted the people in the name of water control, while ordinary landlords and despots were "using their neighbors as a drainage ditch." The reactionary rulers had endless disputes over the fundamental issue of this section of the project. The rulers of Hunan Province tried their best to compete with the water for profit; the rulers of Hubei Province advocated abandoning the fields and returning them to the lake. They never considered the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in Hunan and Hubei provinces. Now, the People's Government, based on the principle of "equal emphasis on Hunan and Hubei, and benefiting both the river and the lake," implements both temporary and permanent measures, completely solving this problem. I deeply realize that only under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government can there be such selfless measures that prioritize the interests of the people. I am from Hunan, and before liberation, I personally witnessed the suffering of the people in the counties along the lake who suffered from floods every year. Now, after reading the news that the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has started construction, I feel extremely excited, and I am sincerely grateful to the People's Government!
    "When Hubei and Hunan are ripe, the whole country is sufficient." This means that as long as the two lakes have a bumper harvest, not only can the people of the two lakes meet their own needs, but they can also support the whole country. However, due to the disastrous rule of the reactionaries in the past, it was difficult to turn the above sentence into reality. Today, in the great Mao Zedong era, under the superior new democratic social system, I celebrate the beginning of this happy day for the people of the two lakes.

    The Communist Party Leads the People to Overcome Natural Disasters
    The Water of the Lower Yellow River Can Be Used to Irrigate the Land

    Editor: The long-awaited news of the "Successful Trial Water Diversion of the Yellow River Irrigation Project to Ji and Wei Rivers" appeared in the People's Daily on March 27. Turning the harmful lower reaches of the Yellow River into a beneficial river is truly the first time in history and a great joy for the Chinese people. The completion of this project will not only turn 360,000 mu to 450,000 mu of farmland in four counties, including Xinxiang and Huojia in Pingyuan Province, into good fields, but also facilitate the navigation of the Wei River.
    Last December, a comrade in our office returned from Guangxi Province and said, "When the train passed through Xinxiang, I saw a sea of people building water conservancy projects there." Soon, I saw the news in the newspaper that "the Yellow River Irrigation Project to Ji and Wei Rivers will release water in April this year." Now I know that this project has been successfully tested. How happy I am! I told the farmers in the Hengshui Prefecture about this news, and they all laughed like me. Many elderly farmers happily said, "Being able to use the water of the Yellow River to irrigate the land in this place—referring to the lower reaches of the Yellow River—has never happened in thousands of years. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, who could see this good thing!" Recalling when I took geography class at school before the Anti-Japanese War, I heard the saying "The Yellow River has hundreds of harms, but only benefits the Hetao area." This sentence has probably been circulating for many years. At that time, I wondered, "The Yellow River, which is more than 8,800 li long, is one of the four major rivers in China. Why can only the Hetao area benefit, while the lower reaches are plagued by floods?" Later, I slowly understood the reason: in the past, the feudal emperors, feudal warlords, and Kuomintang reactionary rulers never eliminated this great harm for the people, except for oppressing, exploiting, and slaughtering them.
    After liberation, the people became the masters of the new China. The Communist Party educated the peasants to fight against feudal forces and natural disasters, and led the peasants in the lower reaches of the Yellow River to stand up and straighten their backs. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, they will gradually utilize the water power of the Yellow River and make it serve the people. In the future, the Yellow River will no longer be "hundreds of harms" but hundreds of benefits. The saying "The Yellow River has hundreds of harms, but only benefits the Hetao area" will slowly become a historical idiom and disappear from the minds of the peasants. This great happy event that has never happened in thousands of years will be gloriously written in Chinese history and passed down from generation to generation.

    伟大祖国的建设给人民带来喜悦
    修筑荆江分洪工程的计划
    完全合乎劳动人民的心愿
    编辑同志：我是湖北省荆江地区公安县人，荆江一带的地方我都到过。对于遭受水害以后的滋味，我和每一个生长在荆江一带的人一样，是尝够了的。因此，我觉得荆江分洪工程计划的每一点，都合乎劳动人民的心愿。
    洪水，在我们那里的人看来，简直胜于毒蛇猛兽。人们每年都为此提心吊胆。洪水冲破堤防，荆江地区人民的粮食房屋就全被淹没了。就是侥幸冲不破堤，每年从春水到秋汛，洪水从太平口等地，也随时可能灌进田来，人们随时有被迫逃荒的危险。抗战胜利的那一年，荆江大堤曾破了一次，荆江地区成了千里泽国。第二年水退了，好田都成了沙滩，庄园变成了河道，但反动的国民党政府根本不管老百姓的死活。在人民遭受水灾后，地主恶霸却大发横财。我们那里有用堤围着的一个个垸子，每个垸子都有一个“修防主任”。这个“主任”只有地主恶霸才能当。这些地主恶霸有时为了保护自己垸子不受淹，他们就偷偷地派狗腿子戳穿别人的垸子。总之，“修防主任”在破堤时有破堤的赚钱办法，不破堤时有不破堤的赚钱办法，受害的和修堤的都是老百姓。
    解放后，人民政府领导人民治洪水，荆江大堤就没有再破过。今年中央人民政府又决定兴修荆江分洪工程，永远治服洪水，这是荆江地区人民的大喜事。现在荆江分洪工程已全面开工了，分洪地区的人民在政府帮助下，有计划地移到安全区安家生产，这是多么英明的措施！我看到荆江分洪工程的报道，就从内心里发笑了。我想荆江一带的人民也一定要笑，因为人们都会感到：荆江地区的人民在毛主席领导下，将永远摆脱洪水的威胁，向更富裕和幸福的生活前进！

    修好荆江分洪工程以后洞庭湖粮仓就要更丰满了
    编辑同志：我是一个军属，住在洞庭湖滨几十年了。我几十年来，年年是在水、旱的灾难中过日子。解放后，我们分到了土地，政府又领导我们防水、抗旱、防虫。我们连年得到丰收。但是我日日夜夜还想着一件事：用个什么法子堵住洪水，使洞庭湖滨肥沃的土地永远不被水淹才好。最近，看到了中央人民政府政务院关于荆江分洪工程的规定后，我高兴极了。我衷心地感谢人民政府，感谢共产党。人民政府和共产党领导人民修治了淮河，如今又领导人民治理长江，保障荆江两岸人民生命财富的安全和数百万亩农田的丰收，保护长江航运的畅通。
    现在荆江分洪工程已全面开工了，我决心要为荆江分洪工程做很多事情。我要动员乡亲们，用最大的努力，来参加这个工程。我是军属，我更要带头参加这个工程，因为我知道：只有把荆江分洪工程做好，才能永远没有水灾，洞庭湖的粮仓才永远是我们自己的。

    伟大的毛泽东时代实现了两湖人民的期望
    编辑同志：我国第二个巨大的水利工程——荆江分洪工程，已经全面开工了。长江中游荆江段治水工作，在反动统治时期，也曾听说过。那时候，反动统治者以治江为名，向人民进行敲榨，一般地主恶霸，则是“以邻为壑”。对于这一段工程治标治本的问题，反动统治者曾经争论不休。湖南方面的统治者极力与水争利；湖北方面的统治者则主张废田还湖。他们绝不顾及湖南、湖北两省千百万人民生命财产的安全。现在，人民政府本着“湘鄂并重，江湖两利”的原则，实行标本兼治，完全解决了这个问题。我深刻地体会到只有在毛主席和中央人民政府正确的领导下，才有这样大公无私，以人民利益为前提的措施。我是湖南人，在解放前，我亲眼看见过滨湖各县人民年年遭受洪水灾害的痛苦，现在看了荆江分洪工程开始施工的消息，我感到无比的兴奋，我对人民政府由衷地感激！
    “湖广熟，天下足”。这个意思是说：只要两湖丰收，不但两湖人民可以满足自己的需要，而且还可以支援全国。可是由于过去反动派的灾难统治，上面这句话是很难变成现实的。今天，在伟大的毛泽东时代，在优越的新民主主义社会制度下，我欢庆两湖人民这种幸福日子的开始。

    共产党领导人民战胜自然灾害
    黄河下游的水可以用来浇地了
    编辑同志：盼望很久的“引黄灌溉济卫工程试水成功”的消息，在三月二十七日的人民日报上出现了。把多害的黄河下游变为利河，这真是有史以来第一次，是中国人民的大喜事。这一工程的完成，不但可使平原省新乡、获嘉等四县的三十六万亩到四十五万亩农田变为良田，而且便利了卫河的航运。
    去年十二月间，我们机关里有一位同志从广西省回来，他说：“火车路过新乡时，我看到人山人海的人在那里修建水利工程。”不久，我就在报上看到“引黄灌溉济卫工程今年四月放水”的消息，现在又知道这个工程已试水成功了，我是多么高兴呵！我把这个消息告诉了衡水专区的农民，他们也都和我一样笑了。许多老年农民高兴地说：“这地方——指黄河下游——能用黄河水浇地，是古辈千年没有的事，不是共产党人民政府的领导，谁能见到这好事！”回忆抗战以前，我在学校上地理课时，听说了“黄河百害，惟富一套”的成语，这句话恐怕已经流传了许多年代了。那时我曾想：“八千八百多里长的黄河，是中国的四大河流之一，为什么只河套一带能得利，而在下游尽闹水灾呢？”以后我才慢慢了解了这个道理：过去历代的封建皇帝、封建军阀和国民党反动统治者，除了压榨剥削和屠杀人民外，是从来没有给人民除过这一大害的。
    解放后，人民成了新中国的主人。共产党教育农民向封建势力和自然灾害作斗争，领导黄河下游的农民翻了身，挺起了腰。他们要在毛主席的英明领导下，逐渐把黄河的水力利用起来，要它为人民服务。今后的黄河将不再是“百害”而是百利了。“黄河百害，惟利一套”的话，慢慢要成为历史成语，要在农民的思想里灭迹了。这万古千年没有过的大喜事，将要光荣地写在中国的历史上，世世代代为人们所传颂。
