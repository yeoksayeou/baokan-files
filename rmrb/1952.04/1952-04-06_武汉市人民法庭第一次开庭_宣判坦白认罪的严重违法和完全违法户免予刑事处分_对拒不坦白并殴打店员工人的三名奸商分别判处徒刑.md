Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 4th: The Wuhan People's Court, established by order of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, held its first trial on March 31st, announcing verdicts for twenty-two seriously and completely illegal households. Over two thousand representatives from workers, organizations, and law-abiding industrialists and businessmen attended the sentencing meeting. After accepting accusations from representatives of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee branches and worker representatives, the People's Court, based on the spirit of "combining severity with leniency, combining reform with punishment," handled these twenty-two unscrupulous merchants differently. Among them, Ye Ziqin, manager of Huachang Foundry, and Peng Zhirong, manager of Huazhong Hardware Store, were originally seriously illegal households. Ye Ziqin, while undertaking projects for thirteen units, including those for harnessing the Huai River and the Jiji Hydroelectric Power Plant, used methods such as theft, adulteration, and tax evasion to steal over 340 million yuan in state property. Peng Zhirong bribed thirty-nine cadres, stole state economic intelligence, and colluded to rig bids, defrauding the state of over 280 million yuan. These seriously illegal households should have been severely punished, but because they were able to confess voluntarily during the "Five-Anti" movement, were willing to compensate the state for losses, and guaranteed never to repeat the offenses, the People's Court, adhering to the principle of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist," announced that they would be treated as half-legal, half-illegal households. In addition to recovering all the赃款 (zang kuan – stolen money/goods), they were exempted from fines and criminal punishment. Gong Yuwu, manager of Haisheng Trading Company, Liang Qingzhang, manager of Guanchang Machine Factory, and twelve other unscrupulous merchants, all bribed government cadres with huge sums of money, engaged in large-scale exchange speculation and evasion, sold gold and public bonds on the black market, and concealed enemy and puppet property. Each household stole more than 200 million yuan in state property. During the "Five-Anti" movement, they refused to confess voluntarily, and only after workers' accusations and inspection team investigations were they forced to admit their crimes. The People's Court ruled that they should still be treated as seriously illegal households, ordering them to return all赃款 (zang kuan – stolen money/goods) and imposing partial fines.

    Yao Yumin, the owner of Jincheng Stationery and Instrument Company, and Sheng Rusong, manager of Hui'an Trading Company, were both big unscrupulous merchants guilty of all "five poisons." Yao Yumin bribed forty cadres from twenty-five state organs, stole state economic intelligence, and engaged in large-scale tax evasion, smuggling, gold trading, and passing off inferior goods as superior goods, stealing a total of 10.74 billion yuan in state property. The losses inflicted on state property by Sheng Rusong also amounted to 4.1 billion yuan. Both of these households were completely illegal households. However, because Yao Yumin and Sheng Rusong were able to confess and plead guilty voluntarily after mobilization during the "Five-Anti" movement, and their confessions were relatively thorough, the People's Court announced a reduction in their punishment, classifying them as seriously illegal households. In addition to paying back taxes, returning赃款 (zang kuan – stolen money/goods), and paying fines, the illegal installation of imported goods, smuggling, and illegally traded gold were confiscated, but they were exempted from prison sentences.

    Cheng Yiqing, manager of Hanming Glasses Company, Zhang Yinfang, owner of Taihe Yongshan Goods Store, and Zhu Yu'e, female owner of Jieshengxing Carpentry Workshop, not only refused to confess and plead guilty during the "Five-Anti" movement, but also beat young workers who actively reported their crimes, resisting the "Five-Anti" movement. The People's Court ruled that in addition to recovering the money they had stolen from the state and imposing fines, they were sentenced to imprisonment for three months to one and a half years respectively.

    After the sentencing, the unscrupulous merchants who received lenient treatment were immediately released and sent home, while those sentenced to imprisonment were arrested on the spot. The crowd burst into thunderous applause, shouting slogans in support of the People's Court's just verdict. Zhang Xuezhong, chairman of the Wuhan City Store Employees' Union, representing all store employees in the city, supported the People's Court's verdict. He called on all store employees in the city to continue to mobilize, tighten the "gates," and examine illegal industrial and commercial households to prevent any unscrupulous merchants from escaping. Lin Houzhou, vice chairman of the City Federation of Industry and Commerce, representing all law-abiding industrialists and businessmen in the city, supported the People's Court's correct verdict and called on all illegal industrial and commercial households who had not yet reached a conclusion to learn from this trial and recognize that only a swift and thorough confession is the path to survival. Finally, Wang Renzhong, director of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee, explained several policy issues and further called on all workers and shop assistants to continue to improve their fighting capacity in the final decisive battle with the big unscrupulous merchants, and to never withdraw until complete victory is achieved.

    武汉市人民法庭第一次开庭
    宣判坦白认罪的严重违法和完全违法户免予刑事处分
    对拒不坦白并殴打店员工人的三名奸商分别判处徒刑
    【新华社汉口四日电】武汉市人民法庭根据中央人民政府政务院的命令成立后，在三月三十一日第一次开庭，对二十二户严重违法户和完全违法户宣判。参加宣判大会的有职工、机关团体以及正当工商业者代表共二千多人。人民法庭在接受了武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会各分会代表和职工代表的控诉后，根据“严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合”的精神，对这二十二名奸商分别作了处理。其中，华昌翻砂厂经理叶梓琴、华中五金行经理彭志荣等五人原是严重违法户。叶梓琴在承做治淮平车和既济水电厂等十三个单位的工程时，用盗卖、搀杂、偷漏等手段盗骗国家财产三亿四千多万元；彭志荣曾向三十九个干部行贿，盗窃国家经济情报，共同抬标，诈骗国家财产二亿八千多万元。对于这些严重违法户，本应给予严惩，但因他们在“五反”运动中能自动坦白，并愿赔偿国家损失，保证以后决不再犯，人民法庭本着“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的原则，宣布对他们按半守法半违法户处理。除追缴全部赃款外，免予罚款，也免予刑事处分。海生贸易行经理龚毓武、冠昌机器厂经理梁庆章等十二名奸商，都曾以巨款贿赂机关干部，大量地套汇、逃汇，黑市出卖黄金与公债，隐匿敌伪财产，每家所盗窃的国家财产都在二亿元以上。“五反”运动中他们不肯自动坦白，经职工检举和检查组检查后，才被迫承认了所犯各罪，人民法庭判决对他们仍按严重违法户处理，除责令他们退回全部赃款外，并处以部分罚金。
    金城文具仪器公司老板姚豫民和惠安贸易行经理盛如松都是“五毒俱全”的大奸商。姚豫民曾贿赂了二十五个国家机关的四十个干部，盗窃国家经济情报，大规模地偷税漏税、走私、买卖黄金、以坏货冒充好货，盗骗国家财产共达一百零七亿四千多万元。盛如松给予国家财产的损失也达四十一亿元。这两户都是完全违法户。但因姚豫民、盛如松在“五反”运动中经启发动员后尚能自动坦白认罪，且坦白较为彻底，因此，人民法庭宣布减轻对他们的处罚，列入严重违法户，除补税、退赃、罚款，对于违法加装进口货和走私部分以及非法买卖的黄金予以没收外，免判徒刑。
    汉明眼镜公司经理程毅卿、泰和永山货行老板张荫芳、解盛兴木作坊女老板朱玉娥等三人，在“五反”运动中不仅不坦白认罪，反而殴打积极检举其罪行的青工，抗拒“五反”运动，人民法庭判决除追缴他们盗骗国家财产的款项，处以罚金外，并分别判处三个月至一年半的徒刑。
    宣判完毕后，受到宽大处理的奸商立即被释放回家，判处徒刑的奸商，当场执行逮捕。群众掌声雷动，高呼口号拥护人民法庭的公正判决。武汉市店员工会主席张学忠代表全市店员工人，拥护人民法庭的判决，他号召全市店员工人继续动员起来，把紧“关”口，审查违法工商业户，不让一个奸商漏网。市工商联合会副主任委员林厚周代表全市正当工商业者拥护人民法庭这一正确的判决，并号召所有未曾作出结论的违法工商业户，应从这次审判中得到教育，认清只有迅速彻底坦白才是生路。最后，武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会主任王任重就若干政策问题作了解释，并进一步号召全市工人店员在和大奸商最后决战阶段，继续提高战斗力，不获全胜决不收兵。
