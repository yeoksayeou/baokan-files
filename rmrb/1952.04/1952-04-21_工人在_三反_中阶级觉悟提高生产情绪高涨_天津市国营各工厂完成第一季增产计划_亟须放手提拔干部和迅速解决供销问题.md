    Workers' Class Consciousness Enhanced and Production Enthusiasm Increased in the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    State-Owned Factories in Tianjin Complete First Quarter Production Increase Plan
    Urgent Need to Boldly Promote Cadres and Quickly Solve Supply and Sales Problems
    In the "Three-Anti" movement, workers in state-owned enterprises in Tianjin further enhanced their class consciousness and not only achieved brilliant victories on the "Three-Anti" front, but also basically completed the product plan for the first quarter's production increase and savings plan.
    The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy extensively and deeply mobilized the masses, and the masses' class consciousness greatly improved. In Tianjin's state-owned enterprises, workers and staff participating in "tiger hunting teams" accounted for one-third of the total, and even more workers participated in reporting. Workers and staff of State-Owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory alone submitted more than 18,900 pieces of reporting materials and clues. Some people who had never participated in political activities before also voluntarily requested to join the "tiger hunting teams" this time. After major corruption cases were successively uncovered in various factories, the morale of the workers and staff was very high. However, the production situation in various factories in January was not good. Because the production plan for January was not issued until the 20th; the right-leaning thinking of leading cadres had not yet been reversed, and many corrupt elements were still entrenched in leading positions, pretending to be doing their jobs; in addition, some leading cadres had the erroneous idea of "discussing production after the 'Three-Anti' campaign is over," so most state-owned factories did not complete their plans. In mid-February, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for State-Owned Enterprises and the Tianjin Municipal Committee for Savings Inspection successively instructed various factories to pay attention to maintaining production. After various factories successively established production command organizations and strengthened production leadership, the situation quickly changed. The "tiger hunting teams" and the workers remaining at their production posts made mutual guarantees and encouraged each other to compete. With fewer people, the tasks still had to be completed. Many workers spontaneously created new working methods, improved labor organization, and increased work efficiency to solve the difficulty of insufficient manpower. The Hygiene Materials Factory drew one person from every three skilled workers to participate in the anti-corruption struggle. The workers came up with a solution: two skilled workers would lead one apprentice to work, and they finally solved the problem of manpower shortage and overfulfilled the task. Many workers worked hard to study technology and improve labor efficiency, ensuring the improvement of quantity and quality. Many workers who had always been considered "backward elements" also became active in this movement. In some factories, the "tiger hunting teams" and the workers remaining in the workshops encouraged each other and spontaneously launched competitions. This is the reason why state-owned enterprises in Tianjin basically completed their first quarter production tasks.
    However, in the first quarter, the production situation in state-owned factories in Tianjin was not balanced, and there are still some problems in production that urgently need to be solved. Wherever the masses were fully mobilized in the "Three-Anti" movement and a certain amount of force was drawn to lead production, both anti-corruption and production achieved good results. Where the masses were mobilized, but no attention was paid to leading production, although victories were achieved on the anti-corruption front, production was affected. In some factories, the leading cadres did not seriously conduct self-criticism at each level, the masses were not well mobilized, and neither the "Three-Anti" campaign nor production was done well. These factories still need to seriously carry out democratic reforms. The urgent problems to be solved in various factories at present are the supply of raw materials, product sales, and cadre vacancies. According to statistics from 24 state-owned factories in Tianjin, product backlog reached more than 380 billion yuan, and the financial revenue and expenditure plan for the first quarter was not completed. The phenomenon of raw material supply shortages is also quite serious. Cadre vacancies are also mostly in procurement, sales, accounting, and basic construction departments. Many units have already begun to promote cadres on a large scale from among active workers. Although these new cadres are not familiar with the business, they are conscientious and responsible for their work. With the active help of leading cadres, many people have already made achievements in their work. The production enthusiasm of the workers is also even higher because of this. All factories should continue to boldly promote cadres in order to effectively solve various problems in production. (Shi Ying)

    工人在“三反”中阶级觉悟提高生产情绪高涨
    天津市国营各工厂完成第一季增产计划
    亟须放手提拔干部和迅速解决供销问题
    天津市国营企业工人，在“三反”运动中进一步提高了阶级觉悟，不但在“三反”战线上获得辉煌胜利，并且基本上完成了第一季度增产节约计划的产品计划。
    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争广泛而深入地发动了群众，群众的阶级觉悟大大提高了一步。天津市国营企业职工参加“打虎队”的占总人数的三分之一，参加检举的工人更多。只是国营天津第二棉纺织厂的工人职员，就提出了检举材料和线索一万八千九百多件。有些一向不参加政治活动的人，这次也自动要求参加了“打虎队”。各厂相继破获了大贪污案件后，职工的情绪十分高涨。但是，一月份各厂的生产情况是不好的。因为，一月份的生产计划迟到二十日才布置下去；领导干部的右倾思想还没扭转，不少贪污分子还盘踞在领导岗位上装模做样；加以有些领导干部又有“搞完‘三反’再谈生产”的错误思想，所以多数的国营工厂没有完成计划。二月中，中共天津市国营企业党委和天津市节约检查委员会先后指示各厂注意维持生产，各厂相继成立了生产指挥机构，加强生产领导后，情况很快就有了变化。“打虎队”和留在生产岗位上的工人互相提出保证，互相鼓励竞赛。人少了，任务还要完成，许多工人自发地创造出新的工作方法，改善劳动组织，提高工作效率，解决人手不够的困难。卫生材料厂在每三个熟练工人中抽出一个参加反贪污斗争。工人们就想出办法，由两个熟练工人带一个徒弟来工作，终于解决了人手少的困难，超额完成了任务。许多工人努力钻研技术，提高劳动效率，保证了产量、质量的提高。许多一贯被认为是“落后分子”的工人，在这次运动中也活跃起来了。有些厂的“打虎队”和留在车间的工人互相鼓舞，自动展开竞赛。这是天津市国营企业基本上完成第一季生产任务的原因。
    但是，在第一季中，天津市国营工厂的生产情况并不是平衡的，生产中还有一些问题急须解决。凡是在“三反”运动中充分发动了群众而又抽出一定力量领导生产的，反贪污和生产都做出了很好的成绩。群众发动了，但没有注意领导生产的，虽然在反贪污战线上获得了胜利，但生产却受到了影响。有些厂的领导干部没有认真地层层进行检讨，群众没有很好地发动，“三反”和生产都没有搞好。这些工厂还须要认真地补行民主改革。目前各厂急须解决的问题是原材料供应、产品推销和干部缺额问题。据天津市二十四个国营工厂的统计，产品积压达三千八百多亿元，第一季的财务收支计划没有完成。原材料供应不上的现象也相当严重。干部的缺额也多在采购、推销、会计以及基本建设部门。许多单位已经开始大批从工人积极分子中提拔干部。这些新干部虽然对业务不熟悉，但是对工作认真负责，加上领导干部对他们积极帮助，许多人在工作上都已做出了成绩。工人群众的生产情绪也因之更为高涨。各厂应该继续放手提拔干部，以便有效地解决生产中的各种问题。    （石英）
