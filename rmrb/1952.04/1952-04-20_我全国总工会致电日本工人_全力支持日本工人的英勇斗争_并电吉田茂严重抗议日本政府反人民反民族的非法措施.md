(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions cabled Japanese workers on the 19th, expressing deep concern and full support for the heroic struggle currently being waged by Japanese workers against the Yoshida reactionary government's drafting of the fascist bill, the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," under the instigation of the American occupation authorities. The telegram reads as follows:

Japanese worker brothers:

The Chinese working class and all working people are deeply concerned about your heroic struggle against the Yoshida reactionary government's drafting of fascist bills under the instigation of the American occupation authorities. These reactionary bills aim to completely deprive Japanese workers and all Japanese people of their democratic, freedom, and survival rights. They aim to suppress the Japanese people's struggle for national independence and against American occupiers and traitors. This will not only lead the entire Japanese nation into a new war disaster but also seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world. The current struggle of Japanese worker brothers, which has such great significance, has earned the high respect of workers worldwide, especially Chinese workers.

The Chinese workers not only fully understand the suffering currently endured by Japanese workers but also firmly believe that the Japanese working class and patriotic people will strengthen their unity and achieve victory in this struggle against the fascist bill. Chinese workers fully support your just struggle, and we have lodged a strong protest with the Yoshida government.

(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions cabled Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 19th, strongly protesting the Japanese government's anti-people and anti-national illegal measures in enacting the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The telegram reads as follows:

Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida:

The Japanese government has violated the principles of democratizing Japan as stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration by enacting bills such as the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," depriving the Japanese working class and patriotic people of all democratic rights, suppressing the Japanese people's national liberation movement, and attempting to more openly revive militarism, making Japan completely a base for the United States to conduct aggressive wars, thus arousing great indignation among the Japanese and the world's working people.

We, the Chinese working class and all working people, firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese workers and strongly protest against the Japanese government's anti-people and anti-national illegal measures.

    我全国总工会致电日本工人
    全力支持日本工人的英勇斗争
    并电吉田茂严重抗议日本政府反人民反民族的非法措施
    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国总工会十九日致电日本工人，表示深切关怀和全力支持日本工人目前正在进行的反对吉田反动政府在美国占领当局授意下制定法西斯化法案“防止破坏活动法案”的英勇斗争。电文如下：日本工人兄弟们：
    中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民深切关怀着你们目前所进行的反对吉田反动政府在美国占领当局的授意下制定法西斯化法案的英勇斗争。这些反动法案是要完全剥夺日本工人以及一切日本人民的民主、自由与生存权利的，是要镇压日本人民争取民族独立、反对美国占领者和卖国贼的民族解放斗争的，这就不仅要引导整个日本民族陷入新的战争灾难，而且严重地威胁亚洲与世界的和平。具有这样伟大意义的日本工人兄弟当前所进行的斗争，获得了全世界工人特别是中国工人崇高的敬意。
    中国工人不仅完全理解日本工人当前所遭受的苦难，而且深信日本工人阶级和爱国人民在这次反对法西斯法案的斗争中必将加强团结并获得胜利。中国工人全力支持你们的正义斗争，我们已向吉田政府提出严重抗议。

    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国总工会十九日致电日本政府首相吉田茂，严重抗议日本政府制定“防止破坏活动法案”的反人民反民族的非法措施。电文如下：吉田茂首相：
    日本政府竟违背了波茨坦宣言所规定的民主化日本的原则，制定“防止破坏活动法案”等法案，剥夺日本工人阶级和爱国人民一切民主权利，镇压日本人民的民族解放运动，并企图更加公开地复活军国主义，使日本完全成为美国进行侵略战争的基地，因而引起了日本与全世界劳动人民的极大愤慨。
    我们中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民坚决支持日本工人的正义斗争，对日本政府这种反人民反民族的非法措施提出严重抗议。
