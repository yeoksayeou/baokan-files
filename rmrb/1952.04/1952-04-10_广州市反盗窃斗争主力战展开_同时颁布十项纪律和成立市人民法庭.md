Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 9th. The large-scale campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in Guangzhou officially began on the 7th. From that day on, the prelude to Guangzhou's "Five-Anti" movement ended, and it entered the second battle according to the established plan. This main battle will be launched simultaneously in dozens of industries, including seventeen key industries. The Guangzhou Municipal Committee for Economy and Austerity Checking and the "Five-Anti" Movement Committee convened a "Guangzhou Municipal People of All Circles Launch Five-Anti Struggle Conference" on the afternoon of the 7th, attended by 60,000 workers, shop assistants, and people from all walks of life. Ye Jianying, Mayor of Guangzhou, issued a marching order at the conference, calling on the city's people to immediately stand on their battle posts and fight more fiercely. Ye Jianying pointed out that the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou has formed a very favorable situation after carrying out various preparatory work and achieving victory in the prelude. Now it is necessary to further expand the scale of the struggle, further expand the results, and carry out the "Five-Anti" struggle to the end, and never stop until complete victory is achieved. In his speech, Ye Jianying elaborated on the purpose and content of the "Five-Anti" struggle, announced the standards and methods for classifying and handling industrial and commercial households in Guangzhou, and pointed out that the struggle must be combined with production to ensure that the movement proceeds in an orderly manner.

Huang Minwei, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, accepted Ye Jianying's combat order on behalf of the city's workers and shop assistants. Youth representative Chen En, women's representative Yu Hui, and representatives of various democratic parties, Guo Qiaoran, all expressed their full support for the marching order to carry out the "Five-Anti" to the end in their speeches. At the conference, worker representatives Mo Derun from the new medicine industry and new medicine commercial stores, Li Quan from the rice and grain processing industry, and Ma Chang from the vegetable oil industry and commercial stores, accused the crimes of illegal capitalists in these industries.

After the accusations, Vice Mayor Zhu Guang, representing the Guangzhou Municipal Committee for Economy and Austerity Checking and the "Five-Anti" Movement Committee, announced the handling methods for a number of industrial and commercial households in the four pilot industries during the prelude battle: the new medicine industry, new medicine commercial, rice and grain processing industry, and vegetable oil industry. There were a total of 187 households in this batch, of which 16 were law-abiding households, 67 were basically law-abiding households, and 87 were half-law-abiding and half-illegal households. Jinmei Pharmacy had evaded taxes over the past two years, causing a loss of more than 300 million yuan in state assets, and had corrupted several cadres of state organs. According to the severity of its crimes, it should have been classified as a seriously illegal household. However, because the owner of the pharmacy, Yin Boqin, confessed relatively well and was able to report the illegal activities of eleven pharmacies, he was given lenient treatment and treated as a half-law-abiding and half-illegal household. Zhu Wohuai, Deputy Manager of Lian'an Pharmacy, and Liu Manqiu, Deputy Manager of Huanan Pharmacy, whose illegal circumstances were serious, were granted release on bail because they were still willing to confess and repent during interrogation in the People's Court and were willing to return the embezzled money. Fifteen severely criminal industrial and commercial operators in the new medicine industry, new medicine commercial, rice and grain processing industry, and vegetable oil industry, who were extremely unpopular and refused to confess after repeated education, including Liu Wenliang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Pharmaceutical Industry Association and Manager of Xinguang Pharmaceutical Factory, Yu Yaoliang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Pharmaceutical Commerce Association and Manager of Baiwei Pharmacy, Huang Yongyu, Manager of Renfeng Rice Mill in the rice and grain processing industry, and Kuang Liangguang, person in charge of Chengchang Firm in the vegetable oil industry, were arrested on the spot and sent to the Municipal People's Court for trial and punishment, based on their criminal facts and the demands of the masses.

In order to ensure that the "Five-Anti" movement proceeds vigorously and in an orderly manner, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government promulgated ten disciplines regarding the "Five-Anti" movement, and notified all agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, people from all walks of life, and personnel participating in the "Five-Anti" movement to strictly abide by and implement them. The Municipal People's Court, which handles illegal cases in the "Five-Anti" movement, has also been established.

    广州市反盗窃斗争主力战展开
    同时颁布十项纪律和成立市人民法庭
    【新华社广州九日电】广州市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争的大进军在七日正式开始。从这一天起，广州市的“五反”运动的序幕战结束了，按照既定计划，进入第二战役。这一主力战，要在几十个行业，其中包括十七个重点行业中同时展开。市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会在七日下午召开了有六万工人、店员和各界人民参加的“广州市各界人民展开五反斗争大会”，广州市人民政府市长叶剑英在大会上下达了进军命令，号召全市人民立即站到战斗岗位上，更加猛烈地作战。叶剑英指出：广州市的“五反”运动在进行各项准备工作和取得序幕战的胜利后，已形成了非常有利的形势，现在要进一步扩大斗争的规模，进一步扩张战果，把“五反”斗争进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。叶剑英在讲话中阐述了“五反”斗争的目的和内容，宣布了广州市对工商业户的分类处理的标准和办法，并指出斗争必须和生产相结合，保证运动有秩序地进行。
    广州市总工会筹备会主任黄民伟代表全市工人、店员接受叶剑英的作战命令。青年代表陈恩、妇女代表余慧、各民主党派代表郭翘然在讲话中都表示完全拥护把“五反”进行到底的进军号令。在大会上，新药工业和新药商业店员工人代表莫德润、米粮加工业工人代表黎权、植物油业店员工人代表马昌控诉了这些行业中的违法资本家的罪行。
    控诉结束后，副市长朱光代表广州市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会宣布对在序幕战期中的四个试点行业——新药工业、新药商业、米粮加工业和植物油业一批工商户的处理办法。这批工商户共有一百八十七户，其中十六户为守法户，六十七户为基本守法户，八十七户为半守法半违法户。金美药房两年来曾偷税漏税使国家资财损失三亿多元，并腐蚀了几个国家机关干部，按其犯罪程度原应列入严重违法户，但因该药房老板尹伯勤坦白较好，又能检举十一家药房的违法行为，因此给予宽大处理，将其当作半守法半违法户处理。违法情节严重的联安药房副经理朱沃槐、华南药房副经理刘满球，因在人民法院审讯时尚愿坦白悔改，并愿退出赃款，因此准予取保释放。新药工业、新药商业、米粮加工业、植物油业中有十五户罪大恶极，民愤极大，经再三教育仍拒不坦白的违法工商业者，包括广州市新药工业同业公会筹备会主任委员、新光制药厂经理刘文亮，广州市新药商业同业公会筹备会主任委员、百威药房经理虞尧梁，米粮加工业仁丰机米厂经理黄咏雩，植物油业成昌行负责人邝亮光等，根据他们的罪恶事实和群众要求，当场予以逮捕，送市人民法庭审理惩办。
    为了使“五反”运动雷厉风行而又有秩序地进行，广州市人民政府颁布了关于“五反”运动期间的十项纪律，通告全市机关、团体、工厂、企业、各界人民和参加“五反”运动的工作人员严格遵守执行。处理“五反”运动中违法案件的市人民法庭也已成立。
