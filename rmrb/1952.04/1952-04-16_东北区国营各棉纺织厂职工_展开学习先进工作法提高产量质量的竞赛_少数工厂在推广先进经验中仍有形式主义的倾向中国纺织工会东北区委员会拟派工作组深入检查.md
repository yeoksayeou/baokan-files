Amidst the intense "Three-Anti" Movement, the work of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method in state-owned cotton textile factories in Northeast China continues to advance. By the end of February, all roving frame workers in eight cotton textile factories in Shenyang, Liaoyang, Wafangdian, Yingkou, Jinzhou, and other cities had received training in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method; 19% to 25% of them were proficient in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, 55.4% were generally able to apply it, and 25.09% had studied it but lacked proficiency. Although the 1951 Weaving Work Method was only recently promoted before the "Three-Anti" Movement, due to the workers' enthusiastic learning and the leadership's emphasis on promotion, by the end of February, 1,525 weaving workers had learned this advanced work method (statistics for Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Jinzhou factories were not included). Among them, 31% were proficient, and 69% were generally able to apply it.

After the universal promotion of these two advanced work methods in various factories, the technical level of the workers has greatly improved, their work has changed from passive to active, and the output and quality have been significantly improved, while reducing the leather roller wastage rate. In the first quarter of this year, the average cotton yarn production of each cotton textile factory completed 101.84% of the plan, and cotton cloth completed 100.99% of the plan. The leather roller wastage rate of the Wafangdian Textile Factory has now been reduced to 0.98% of the output, and the loom efficiency has been raised to 88.93%. The first-grade cloth rate of the Yingkou Textile Factory reached 99.672%. In the past, from cadres to workers in this factory, everyone believed that it was impossible for one person to watch eight looms; after the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Work Method, 51 workers can now watch eight ordinary looms (excluding "little teachers"). A worker in the Shenyang Textile Factory used to weave 34 yards of cloth a day and felt very tired; after learning the method, the output increased to 38 yards, and he felt very relaxed. He said emotionally: "I have been an apprentice for three years in the past, but I have never made progress as fast as now. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have such achievements!"

Now, workers in various factories have launched a "full house red" competition to study advanced experiences and ensure increased production and quality. Workers in the Yingkou Textile Factory use red, yellow, and green flags in the competition to reward those with excellent results. On the basis of the red flag competition, they have also launched the "increase machine and protect machine campaign" and the "mutual supervision," "mutual learning," and "mutual assistance" "three mutual" movement. Textile factories in Shenyang, Liaoyang, Wafangdian, and Jinzhou have also launched various forms of red flag competitions. The workers all said: "Learn advanced work methods completely one day earlier and strive for 'full house red.'"

The emphasis of leading cadres and technicians on promoting advanced work methods is an important reason for making achievements. Although the "Three-Anti" Movement was very intense in February and March, each factory had certain cadres in charge of leading the promotion work. The director of the Shenyang Textile Factory personally gave lessons to the workers, explaining the spirit and content of the 1951 Weaving Work Method. The director, engineers, and chairman of the trade union of the Liaoyang Textile Factory personally went to the workshops to comfort advanced producers and give them red flags. Cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League regularly hold seminars to study the problems in the promotion. In order to better promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the leading cadres of the Yingkou Textile Factory specifically conducted a training and test for the cadres of the workshops, teams, and groups. Some cadres could not answer in the test and felt very embarrassed, realizing that they could only promote others if they truly learned it themselves.

The enthusiasm of engineering and technical personnel for advanced work methods is also one of the reasons why the promotion of advanced work methods can be relatively smooth. For example, in the past, the weft yarn spun by the Shenyang Textile Factory was small and placed randomly, which increased the number of weft changes and time for weaving workers, and the work efficiency was not improved. After the workers reflected this opinion, the engineers went to the workshop to help solve this problem. Technician Chen Xianglin of the Wafangdian Textile Factory actively led the technical personnel and workers to study advanced work methods. They all helped the workers overcome many difficulties.

The promotion of these two advanced work methods in the Northeast state-owned cotton textile factories has gone through arduous educational work. At the beginning, due to insufficient understanding of advanced work methods, technical workers generally had conservative ideas. Some emphasized objective reasons, saying: "What advanced work method! If the machine is not good, nothing will work." Others were conservative about their old technology and were not humble in learning. An old technician in the Yingkou Textile Factory said at the beginning of learning: "No method is better than my old method." Some people looked down on the "little teachers," picked on the "little teachers," and said: "I have been working for more than ten years, and I am not as good as you seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl!" More generally, many workers were afraid of hardship in their studies and were unwilling to work hard. As soon as they learned it, they thought it was almost enough and did not make further efforts. After the Yingkou Textile Factory and other factories promoted the 1951 Weaving Work Method, many workers increased the number of machines they watched, and some old workers therefore had new concerns: "If everyone learns the 1951 Weaving Work Method and generally watch more machines, won't there be many more workers? Will there be staff reduction again?"

In eliminating various ideological obstacles, all cotton textile factories have carried out relatively in-depth ideological education work. Combining with the "Three-Anti" Movement, they have raised the workers' class consciousness and stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm; and explained to the workers that the promotion of advanced production experience is the basic method of increasing production and practicing economy.

Using real people and real things to educate workers is an effective way to break conservative ideas and promote learning. The performance and demonstration of the "little teachers" played a great role in the promotion work. An stubborn old worker in the Shenyang Textile Factory said after watching the "little teacher" perform: "The 1951 Weaving Work Method is really good, I guarantee I will learn it." After watching the performance, many workers pulled the "little teacher"'s hand and asked: "Teach me first! Otherwise, I will fall behind!" Worker Zhao Shuyuan of the Yingkou Textile Factory used to say everywhere that "the 1951 Weaving Work Method will not work"; after the leaders helped him and watched the "little teacher"'s performance, he took the initiative to find the "little teacher" to teach him. After he learned it, the promotion committee asked him to report to the workers in the group meeting on his ideological transformation process and the superiority of the 1951 Weaving Work Method. He spoke vividly, and many backward workers were greatly moved.

The establishment of contact contracts between the workshops has also played a great role in promoting advanced work methods. Wafangdian, Yingkou, Liaoyang, and other factories have all established and implemented workshop contact contracts, so that the roving frame and weaving workshops can smoothly promote advanced work methods. The maintenance and spinning workers of these factories have also learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method; they have also created advanced operating methods for maintenance and spinning, such as the shafting work method of the Wafangdian Textile Factory, and the advanced work method of the cotton picking workshop of the Yingkou Textile Factory.

In the past three months, although the promotion of advanced work methods in the Northeast cotton textile factories has made great achievements, there are still some problems. First of all, the degree of promotion in each factory is unbalanced. Some factories have promoted it more universally, while others still have serious formalism and have not carried out the promotion work from beginning to end. Until now, the leading cadres of some factories do not even know how many workers have learned it. Secondly, more general promotion work has been done, but in-depth inspection and supervision are not enough. Therefore, some workers do not seriously implement what they have learned, and some factories have found fake "Hao Jianxiu workers." The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the leading cadres of these factories do not pay enough attention to advanced work methods and only let the workshop cadres and "little teachers" do it. The cadres of the Textile Administration Bureau of the Northeast Industry Department and the Northeast Committee of the China Textile Trade Union were busy with the "Three-Anti" during this period and relaxed their leadership in the promotion work.

Recently, the Northeast Committee of the China Textile Trade Union is preparing to organize work teams to go deep into various factories to check the implementation, summarize experience, and further vigorously promote it.

    东北区国营各棉纺织厂职工
    展开学习先进工作法提高产量质量的竞赛
    少数工厂在推广先进经验中仍有形式主义的倾向中国纺织工会东北区委员会拟派工作组深入检查
    在紧张的“三反”运动中，东北区国营各棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法的工作在继续前进。沈阳、辽阳、瓦房店、营口、锦州等八个棉纺织厂的细纱车工，到二月底为止，已全部受过郝建秀工作法的训练；精通郝建秀工作法的占百分之十九至二十五，一般能运用的占百分之五十五点四，虽学习过而熟练程度差的占百分之二十五点零九。一九五一织布工作法，虽在“三反”运动前不久才开始推广，但三个月来，由于职工们热情学习和领导方面重视推广，到二月底为止，已有一千五百二十五个织布工人学习了这先进工作法（佳木斯、牡丹江、锦州三厂未统计）。其中精通者占学习人数的百分之三十一，能一般运用的占百分之六十九。
    各厂普遍推广这两个先进工作法后，职工们技术水平大为提高，工作由被动转变为主动，显著地提高了产量和质量，降低了皮辊花率。今年第一季度，各棉纺织厂棉纱平均产量完成计划百分之一百零一点八四，棉布完成计划百分之一百点九九。瓦房店纺织厂皮辊花现降为产量的百分之零点九八，织机台效率发挥到百分之八十八点九三。营口纺织厂正布率达到百分之九十九点六七二。这个厂从干部到工人，过去都认为一人看八台织布机是不可能的事；经推广一九五一织布工作法后，已有五十一名工人可以看八台普通织布机了（“小先生”不在内）。沈阳纺织厂有一个工人，过去每天织三十四码布，感到很累；经学习后，产量提高到三十八码，还感到很轻松。他感动得说：“我过去学了三年徒，也没有现在进步快。没有共产党、毛主席领导，我那能有这样的成绩！”
    现在，各厂职工，都展开了学习先进经验，保证提高产量质量的“满堂红”竞赛。营口纺织厂职工在竞赛中以红、黄、绿三种旗，奖给成绩优良者。在红旗竞赛的基础上，又开展了“增台保台运动”和“互相监督”“互相学习”“互相帮助”的“三互运动”。沈阳、辽阳、瓦房店、锦州等纺织厂，也都开展了各种形式的红旗竞赛。职工们都说：“早一天全部学会先进工作法，争取‘满堂红’。”
    领导干部和技术人员重视推广先进工作法，是做出成绩的重要原因。二、三月份，“三反”虽然很紧张，但各厂都有一定的干部主持领导推广工作。沈阳纺织厂车间主任亲自给职工上课，讲解一九五一织布工作法的精神和内容。辽阳纺织厂厂长、工程师和工会主席，亲自下车间慰问先进生产者，给他们插红旗。党、行政、工会、青年团的干部定期开研究会，研究推广中的问题。营口纺织厂为更好地推广郝建秀工作法，领导干部专门对车间和班、组干部进行了一次训练和测验。有的干部在测验中答不出来，感到很难为情，认识到只有自己真正学好才能推动别人。
    工程技术人员对于先进工作法的热心，也是先进工作法的推广能够比较顺利的原因之一。如沈阳纺织厂过去纬纱纺得小，并且乱放一起，使织布工人增加了换纬次数和时间，工作效率提不高。工人反映了这个意见后，工程师便深入车间帮助解决这个问题。瓦房店纺织厂技术员陈祥林，积极地领导技术人员和工人研究先进工作法。他们都帮助工人克服了不少困难。
    这两个先进工作法在东北国营各棉纺织厂推广，是经过艰苦的教育工作的。开始时，由于对先进工作法认识不足，技术工人普遍有保守思想。有的强调客观原因说：“什么先进工作法！机器不好，说啥也不行。”有的是保守自己的老一套技术，不虚心学习。营口纺织厂一个老技术工人在学习开始时说：“什么法也没有我的老办法好。”有的人看不起“小先生”，挑“小先生”的毛病，说：“我干了十几年，还比不上你十七、八岁的小姑娘！”更普遍的现象，是许多职工在学习中怕艰苦，不愿下苦工夫。刚刚学会，就认为差不多了，不作进一步的努力。营口纺织厂等推广一九五一织布工作法后，很多工人增加了看台数，部分老工人因此又产生了新的顾虑：“大家都学会了一九五一织布工作法，普遍多看机器，不就又要多出很多工人吗？是不是又会定员裁人呢？”
    在排除各种思想障碍中，各棉纺织厂都进行了比较深入的思想教育工作。结合“三反”运动，提高工人的阶级觉悟，激发职工的生产热情；并向职工说明，推广先进生产经验是增产节约的基本方法。
    用真人实事教育职工，是打破保守思想、推动学习的有效办法。“小先生”的表演和示范，在推广工作中起了很大的作用。沈阳纺织厂一个最固执的老工人，看过“小先生”表演后说：“一九五一织布工作法真好，我保证要学会。”许多工人看过表演后，拉着“小先生”的手要求：“你先教我吧！要不然，我就落后啦！”营口纺织厂工人赵树元，过去到处说“一九五一织布工作法行不通”；经过领导干部帮助，和看过“小先生”表演后，他主动地找“小先生”教了。他学会以后，推广委员会就让他在小组会上向职工报告他思想转变的经过和一九五一织布工作法的优越性，他讲得有声有色，许多落后的职工都大受感动。
    各车间订立了联系合同，对推广先进工作法也起了很大的作用。瓦房店、营口、辽阳等厂，都已订立和贯彻了车间联系合同，使细纱、织布车间都能顺利推广先进工作法。这些厂的保全和前纺工人，也都学会了郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法；他们并由此创造了保全、前纺的先进操作法，如瓦房店纺织厂的上轴工作法、营口纺织厂拣棉车间的先进工作法等。
    三个月来，东北各纺织厂推广先进工作法虽有很大成绩，但也还有一些问题。首先，就是各厂推广的程度不平衡，有的厂推广得比较普遍，有的厂形式主义仍很严重，没有有始有终地进行推广工作。直到现在，有的厂的领导干部甚至连有多少职工学会了也不知道。其次，是一般的推广工作做得多，深入检查督促不够。因此，有的职工学会了不认真执行，有的厂发现有假“郝建秀工作者”。发生这种现象的原因，主要是这些厂的领导干部对先进工作法重视不够，仅由车间干部和“小先生”去作。东北工业部纺织管理局、中国纺织工会东北区委员会的干部，这个时期忙于“三反”，对推广工作也放松了领导。
    最近，中国纺织工会东北区委员会正准备组织工作组，深入各厂检查执行情况，总结经验，进一步大力推广。
