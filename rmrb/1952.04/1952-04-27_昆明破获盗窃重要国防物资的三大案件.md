Kunming city's People's Government, in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, has successively uncovered three major cases of unscrupulous merchants stealing national defense materials, and has arrested the principal culprits in these three cases.

One of the major theft cases was masterminded by unscrupulous merchants Yang Dongshan (manager of Kunming Zhongya Machinery Factory), Yu Zemin (manager of Xinmin Hardware Factory), Yang Mingxiang (merchant), and Yang Zhuoran (manager of Yuanshenchang). Before and after the peaceful liberation of Yunnan, they colluded with Kuomintang air force personnel to steal a large number of valuable aircraft components in an organized manner. Preliminary investigations have revealed 298 engines, 744 propeller blades, and 15 tons of aluminum strips. Calculated at depreciated value, these materials are worth at least 65.7 billion RMB. If two engines plus other components are assembled into one aircraft, 149 aircraft could be assembled.

Their theft process was as follows: In November 1949, when the People's Liberation Army advanced into Guizhou and Yunnan was brewing an uprising, unscrupulous merchants Yu Zemin and others tried to collude with Wang Bingli, the director of the Kuomintang Air Force Kunming Provisional Aviation Materials Depot (who fled to southern Yunnan after liberation to become a bandit and was later captured by our army), to discuss ways to take the opportunity to steal large quantities of aircraft materials. The result was an agreement: the pseudo-Kunming Provisional Aviation Materials Depot would "declare as scrap and sell" these aviation materials, and unscrupulous merchants such as Yang Dongshan would bid for and purchase them, thereby stealing the materials. To this end, unscrupulous merchants such as Yang Dongshan jointly formed a theft group called the "Hejihao Factory," with Yang Mingxiang as manager and accountant, Yang Zhuoran responsible for finance, Yang Dongshan responsible for transportation, and Yu Zemin responsible for engineering. They also used the name "Hejihao Factory" to sign so-called bidding contracts with the pseudo-Kunming Provisional Aviation Materials Depot. From November 14, 1949, they began to steal and transport propellers and aluminum strips; on the 17th of the same month, they began to steal the first batch of aircraft engines, and on December 3rd, they stole the second batch of aircraft engines. At this time, because the People's Liberation Army was approaching Yunnan, unscrupulous merchants such as Yang Dongshan bribed Ni Chuanjiu, the section chief of the pseudo-Kunming Provisional Aviation Materials Depot, with 30 taels of gold and 300 silver dollars, and used 18-ton flatbed trailers (each capable of carrying eight engines) to speed up the theft. It was not until the third day after the Yunnan uprising on December 9th, when the airport was declared under martial law, that their theft activities were forced to stop.

Most of the important national defense materials they stole were new, but in order to achieve the goal of theft for personal gain and at the same time attempt to destroy evidence, these unscrupulous merchants specially hired more than 120 temporary workers to dismantle and melt these intact aviation materials into aluminum strips. By January 1951, when the theft members broke up due to uneven distribution of spoils, there were still about 100 engines that had not been dismantled. Unscrupulous merchant Yang Dongshan secretly moved this batch of engines to his own Zhongya Machinery Factory and continued to dismantle and melt them. Workers recalled the scene of dismantling, saying: "Opening the boxes, tearing open the oiled paper, seeing the brand-new engines that had never been used once, about to be thrown into the furnace, it really makes people feel heartbroken. If this batch of engines were used to assemble airplanes to fight American devils, how much power would they exert!" Therefore, at that time, many workers protested to the unscrupulous merchants, opposing the trampling on this batch of important national defense materials exchanged for the people's blood and sweat. However, the unscrupulous merchants ignored the workers' protests and instead forced the workers to smear the new engines that had not been dismantled with mud and to blacken the brand-new crankshafts (removed from the aircraft) with fire, and told the foreman: "If inspectors come, just say they are scrap." By June 1951, this batch of important national defense materials was finally completely destroyed.

The value of the national defense materials stolen by another major theft group, based on the verified parts, reached more than 300 billion yuan. The principal culprits of this major theft group are unscrupulous merchants Yue Zongqi, Zhao Guanyi, Wang Hefu, He Canwen, Wu Xiangguang, and others.

Their theft activities were also carried out before and after the peaceful liberation of Yunnan. In 1949, just as the People's Liberation Army was marching towards the Southwest at full speed, unscrupulous merchants Yue Zongqi, Zhao Guanyi, and others colluded with Kuomintang government personnel in the Kunming Aircraft First Manufacturing Factory, Zhan Yi Airport, Wujiaba Airport, and a certain arsenal to carry out large-scale theft activities. They emptied the materials from thirty warehouses and then spent more than two months continuously transporting them back to Kunming. How much national defense material they stole has not yet been ascertained, but the part that has been identified includes: 30,000 automobile tires, more than 10 tons of I-beams, 30 various machines, a complete set of large steam boilers, a large generator capable of driving 200 to 300 horsepower and all its equipment, more than 370,000 sacks, 360 tons of hemp rope, 10 aircraft noses, 200 aircraft fuel tanks, 8 rubber boats, 580 vehicles, including armored vehicles, tanks, and trailers for towing heavy artillery, as well as more than 1,000 tons of automobile parts and heavy machinery parts.

Most of this material was intact, but most of it was dismantled and sold by unscrupulous merchants Yue Zongqi and others at that time or after liberation. The unscrupulous merchants used some of the money from the dismantling and sale and the remaining machines to establish a Jianyuan Industrial Company, with unscrupulous merchant Zhao Guanyi as manager and Yue Zongqi and Wu Xiangguang as associate managers. The company's main business was divided into two parts: one was the chemical part, which used four stolen oxygen generators (estimated to be worth at least 45 billion yuan) and 873 oxygen cylinders (estimated to be worth at least 870 million yuan) to manufacture and sell oxygen; the other was the mechanical part, which used stolen machinery and iron materials to contract various mechanical engineering projects.

Unscrupulous merchants such as Zhao Guanyi continued their theft activities using this company. For example, seeing that oxygen was selling well, they believed it was a rare commodity and raised prices, sometimes selling each bottle for 60,000 to 100,000 yuan higher than the market price. When accepting processing orders from government agencies, they never failed to cut corners. For example, in 1951, Jianyuan Industrial Company sold three Chevrolet engines and three water pumps to the Wenshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Yunnan Province for a total price of 80.4 million yuan. The parts fitted on the engines were all old, and the three water pumps were also old goods that had been used for four years. At that time, worker Wang Hongji asked why they used old goods to deceive the government and farmers. Unscrupulous merchant Wu Xiangguang said, "If I sell three unusable ones, I can buy back four new ones." These engines and waterwheels broke down as soon as they were used. As a result, farmers had to carry water to irrigate their fields, seriously harming agricultural production.

The crimes of these unscrupulous merchants do not stop there. They also bribed and corrupted cadres, frequently evaded taxes, forged and sold vehicle licenses, illegally trafficked in gold and drugs, and engaged in speculation and disruption of the market.

Like the two major theft cases above, another theft case was also very serious. The principal culprit in this theft case was Li Xiangtai, the owner of Kunming Huada Hardware Factory. Before the peaceful liberation of Yunnan, he colluded with Kuomintang air force personnel Feng Shengyang and others to steal three aircraft engines, 73 propeller blades, two lathes, 14 tons of oil pool leather, and a large number of national defense materials worth more than 2.5 billion yuan.

During the "Five-Anti" movement, the principal culprits in these three major theft cases refused to confess their heinous crimes to the people and attempted to sabotage the movement. For example, unscrupulous merchants Yue Zongqi and others threatened the workers, saying: "Whoever dares to report us will be used as a backrest (to die with) in the future." But the workers' class consciousness has been raised. They were not intimidated by the unscrupulous merchants. Many workers reported their crimes with conclusive evidence. Based on reliable witnesses and material evidence, the Kunming Municipal People's Government successively arrested the principal culprits in these three major theft cases, Yang Dongshan, Yu Zemin, Yang Mingxiang, Yang Zhuoran, Yue Zongqi, Zhao Guanyi, Wang Hefu, He Canwen, Wu Xiangguang, and Li Xiangtai, and will impose legal sanctions.

    昆明破获盗窃重要国防物资的三大案件
    昆明市人民政府在“三反”“五反”运动中连续破获了奸商盗窃国防物资的三大案件，并已将这三案的主犯逮捕归案。
    其中一件大盗窃案的主谋者是奸商杨栋珊（昆明市中亚机器厂经理）、俞泽民（新民五金工厂经理）、杨名相（行商）、杨卓然（源慎昌经理）四人。他们在云南和平解放前后与国民党空军人员相勾结，有组织地盗窃了大量飞机上的贵重器材，据初步查明的有发动机二百九十八具，螺旋桨七百四十四叶，铝条十五吨。将这些物资折旧计算，最低价值达人民币六百五十七亿元。如果以两部发动机加上其他机件装配成一架飞机的话，就可以装配一百四十九架飞机。
    他们的盗窃经过是这样的：一九四九年十一月，在人民解放军进军到贵州，云南酝酿起义的时候，奸商俞泽民等就设法和国民党空军昆明临时航空器材库库长王秉立（解放后曾逃往滇南为匪，后被我军捕获）相勾结，商量乘机大批盗窃飞机器材的办法。结果商定：由伪昆明临时航空器材库将这批航空器材“报废标售”，由奸商杨栋珊等投标套购，用这样的方式将物资盗窃出来。为此，奸商杨栋珊等就合资组成了一个名为“合记号工厂”的盗窃集团，由杨名相任经理兼账务，杨卓然负责财务，杨栋珊负责运输，俞泽民负责工务，他们并用“合记号工厂”的名义和伪昆明临时航空器材库订立了所谓标卖合同。从一九四九年十一月十四日起，他们开始盗运螺旋桨和铝条；同月十七日开始盗运第一批航空发动机，十二月三日盗运第二批航空发动机。这时因解放军已快到云南，奸商杨栋珊等又以三十两黄金和三百块银元贿赂伪昆明临时航空器材库课长倪传久，用十八吨载重平板拖车（每车可装八部发动机）加紧盗运，直到十二月九日云南起义后的第三天，飞机场宣告戒严，他们的盗窃活动才被迫停止。
    他们盗窃出来的大批重要国防器材，大部分是新的，可是这些奸商为了达到盗窃自肥的目的，同时企图湮灭罪证，专门雇用了一百二十多个临时工，把这批完好的航空器材拆毁，熔化成铝条。到一九五一年一月，盗窃分子们因分赃不匀而散伙时，还剩下一百具左右的发动机没有拆毁。奸商杨栋珊又暗暗把这一批发动机搬到他自己开设的中亚机器厂，继续拆毁熔化。工人回忆拆毁时的情景说：“打开箱子，撕开油纸，眼看崭新的发动机一次都没有用过，就要丢进熔炉去，老实叫人痛心。这批发动机用来装成飞机打美国鬼子，要发挥多么大的力量啊！”因此当时有许多工人向奸商提出了抗议，反对蹧踏这批用人民的血汗换来的重要国防器材。可是奸商不但不顾工人的抗议，反而强迫工人把来不及拆毁的新发动机用泥巴涂脏，把全新的曲轴（飞机上拆下来的）用火薰黑，并对领班说：“如果有检查的人来，就说是废品。”到一九五一年六月，这批重要国防物资终于被全部破坏净尽。
    另一个大盗窃集团所盗窃的国防物资，据已证实部分，价值就达三千亿元以上。这个大盗窃集团的主犯是奸商岳宗琦、赵贯一、王和甫、何灿文、吴祥光等。
    他们的盗窃活动也是在云南和平解放前后进行的。一九四九年，正当人民解放军兼程向大西南进军的时候，奸商岳宗琦、赵贯一等勾结了昆明飞机第一制造厂、霑益飞机场、巫家坝飞机场和某兵工厂中的国民党政府工作人员，进行了巨大规模的盗窃活动。他们把三十个仓库的器材、物资倾库盗光，然后连续以两个多月的时间运回昆明。他们究竟盗运了多少国防物资，现在还没有查清楚，单是已经查明的部分就有：汽车轮胎三万个，工字铁十多吨，各种机器三十部，全套大蒸汽锅炉，能带动二百至三百匹马力的大发电机及其全部器材，麻袋三十七万多条，麻绳三百六十吨，飞机头十个，飞机油箱二百个，橡皮艇八个，车辆五百八十部，其中包括装甲车、战车和拖重炮用的拖车，此外还有汽车零件和重机械零件达一千吨以上。
    这批物资大部分是完好的，但是多数被奸商岳宗琦等在当时或解放后拆散变卖。奸商们把一部分拆卖所得的钱和留下来的机器开办了一家建云实业公司，由奸商赵贯一任经理，岳宗琦和吴祥光任协理。这个公司的主要营业分两部分：一是化工部分，就是用盗来的制氧机四部（按最低估价约值四十五亿元）和氧气瓶八百七十三个（按最低估价约值八亿七千多万元），制造氧气出售；另一是机械部分，即用盗来的各种机械及铁料，包揽各种机械工程。
    赵贯一等奸商们就利用这一公司继续着盗窃活动。比如，他们看到氧气的销路很好，就认为奇货可居，高抬价格，有时每瓶售价要高过市价六万至十万元。他们在接受政府机关的加工定货时，没有一次不偷工减料。比如一九五一年建云实业公司卖给云南省文山专署三部雪佛兰引擎和三部抽水机，总价八千零四十万元。引擎上所配的零件全是旧的，三部抽水机也是已经用过四年的旧货。当时工人王鸿纪问为何要用旧货欺骗政府和农民，奸商吴祥光说：“我卖了三部用不成的，可以买回来四部新的。”这批引擎和水车一用就坏，结果，农民只好挑水灌田，严重地危害了农业生产。
    这批奸商的罪行还不止如此，他们还行贿腐蚀干部，经常地偷税漏税，假造和贩卖行车执照，非法贩运黄金、毒品，以及投机倒把，扰乱市场等等。
    和上面两大盗窃案一样，另一个盗窃案也是十分严重的。这一盗窃案的主犯是昆明市华达五金工厂老板李祥泰。他在云南和平解放前，勾结国民党空军人员丰盛阳等，盗窃了飞机发动机三部，螺旋桨七十三叶，车床二部，油池皮十四吨以及大批国防器材，价值达二十五亿元以上。
    这三大盗窃案的主犯们在“五反”运动中，对自己的滔天罪行拒不向人民坦白，并且企图破坏运动。例如奸商岳宗琦等曾威胁工人说：“谁要是敢去检举，将来就拿他做垫背（陪死）。”但是工人的阶级觉悟已经提高了，他们没有被奸商吓倒，许多工人都以确凿的证据检举了他们的罪行。昆明市人民政府根据确实的人证物证，先后将这三大盗窃案的主犯杨栋珊、俞泽民、杨名相、杨卓然、岳宗琦、赵贯一、王和甫、何灿文、吴祥光和李祥泰逮捕归案，将予以法律制裁。
