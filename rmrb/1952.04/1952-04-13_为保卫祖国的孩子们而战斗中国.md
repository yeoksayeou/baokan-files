    Fighting to Defend the Children of the Motherland
    Returned Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Pang Huanzhou
    After returning to the motherland, we have seen many miracles created by heroes and heard countless touching stories. Each of us returning representatives deeply feels that the motherland is more beautiful, happier, and more lovable. We are proud and honored to have such a great motherland. Among the many touching examples, the most impressive to me are the adorable children of the motherland.
    In the capital, I will never forget the poem dedicated by a little friend. It was after I introduced the situation on the Korean front to the children of the Middle School attached to the Normal University that a little friend, not taller than the table, jumped onto the podium and recited. The title of the poem was "I Love Volunteer Army Uncles."
    "I pick up a bowl of white rice, thinking of the Volunteer Army uncles on the front lines, a mouthful of fried noodles and a handful of snow, fighting for us.
    ××× We snuggle into our quilts and sleep soundly, uncles win victories all night long. We wake up to a bright day, uncles annihilate large swaths of the enemy.
    ××× The letter you sent back has been seen, all the team members were moved to tears, even better than mom, after shouting slogans we laughed again.
    ××× Thousands of mountains and rivers separate us! Happiness and courage are closely linked. Uncle, please write back often, can't find you on the map.………………………………"
    The recitation was so enthusiastic, so beautiful, so powerful. I was so excited that tears flowed down my face.
    We will never forget the innocent and lovely images of children in various parts of the Northwest. In Xi'an, we were invited by the Young Pioneers to visit the "Children's Garden." They took our hands, walking and pointing, introducing: "This is the Children's Aircraft Model that we donated. I wonder which uncle is flying it to fight the American devils?" "These are the small tanks, small trains, and small rails that we made ourselves. When we grow up, we will be aviators, tank drivers, and train drivers." Turning a corner, little hands pointed to a mud geographical model and said, "Our motherland is really like a beautiful rooster." "This is Yumen, which stores inexhaustible kerosene." "This is Xinjiang, which produces many raisins, which children love to eat." "This is the Longhai Railway, the uncles came from this road." Walking to the "Ideal Campus," another child introduced: "These rows are classrooms; this big house is the library, with beautiful picture books and books that children love to read; this is the playground, with balls, swings, aerial bridges, all kinds of equipment; over there is the garden, with flowers that bloom all year round. We must build such a happy campus." In a corner of the room, there were also various specimens carefully collected by the children: red and green flowers, small birds, small insects... Ah, the children nurtured by Chairman Mao are so smart and so cute! In order to build a happy tomorrow, they have already shown such rich creativity!
    In Lanzhou, children came to see us every day, vying to shake hands with the representatives and ask them to sign autographs. Everyone wanted to give the representatives photos and commemorative badges. Whenever they came, the room was immediately filled with youthful vitality. Singing, dancing, applause after applause, cheers after cheers. If you praised someone a few words, they would innocently throw themselves into your arms. A child under the age of eight performed "Always Ready to Perform Meritorious Service for the Motherland"; a nine-year-old child performed "Singing for the Beloved Motherland"; another nine-year-old child sang and danced, performing "Donating Airplanes and Cannons to Support the Volunteer Army." In the loud singing and lively dancing, we saw their boundless love for the motherland and their infinite trust in the future. In the days we spent with them, we seemed much younger.
    In Linxia City, when we went to participate in the get-together specially prepared for us by the children, a group of children crowded around and carried us into the venue, carried us to the rostrum, and tied the cherished red scarf around our necks. Some children presented beautiful silk pen cases. Some presented embroidered small handkerchiefs. Some were afraid that we would get sick on the road and gave each of us two packs of Rendan (a traditional Chinese medicine). A little girl named Huang Lanhui drew four portraits of herself, writing on the side: "Volunteer Army Uncles, always remember us." A little girl sitting next to me handed me a photo, saying, "I really want to go to Korea to perform meritorious service, but I am not tall enough. I want to exercise well and grow taller, so that in the future I can be like Sister Wang Yaozhen (she is a seventeen-year-old model nurse, a returned representative of the Volunteer Army) and fight the American devils." I was so moved by their love and heroic aspirations that I couldn't help but shout loudly: "The children in the great Mao Zedong era have a forever happy and bright future!" After the meeting, many children surrounded us again, filling our pockets with peanuts and candies with their little hands. They stuffed all our pockets until they were like balls.
    The children of the motherland are very concerned about the life and study of Korean children. Little friends Zhang Leiping and Liu Yimin, after hearing the news that six Korean children had their lips cut off, their tongues severed, and finally brutally murdered by American beasts for singing "The Song of General Kim Il-sung," clenched their little fists and said to us, "Volunteer Army Uncles, take us to Korea! Let's go fight the American devils together and avenge the Korean children." It took us a lot of words to get them to withdraw this innocent and firm request. One day, a group of children ran straight to our dormitory. Seeing us, they hurriedly handed over several dozen pencils, saying, "Uncles, we heard that Korean children use wooden sticks instead of pencils and leaves instead of paper, and we feel very sad. We bought several dozen pencils, please take them to them. We will save paper in the future and send it to them too!" Following, a little girl named Huang Lanhui came, and she wrapped ten pencils and some paper in a white handkerchief and handed it to us, saying, "Uncle, tell the Korean children that we have not forgotten them."
    I heard many touching stories about children in the donation of airplanes and cannons movement. There are also tens of thousands of children who treat the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers as their own parents. In the heated "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many children exposed corrupt and thieving elements. When we arrived at a certain oil mine, we received a letter from Sun Zhenjia, a twelve-year-old elementary school student. The letter read: "Dear Volunteer Army Uncles, in this 'Three-Anti' movement, I exposed my father's shameful corrupt behavior, and I also exposed others. Today, I want to guarantee to the uncles: in the future, I will use practical actions to love our motherland: study hard, exercise my body, and strive to be a model Young Pioneer!"
    Seeing these groups of adorable children, we all deeply feel the greatness of the reserve forces contained in the motherland, and we see more clearly the bright future of the motherland. We have gained new courage and strength.
    Dear comrades on the Korean front! In order to make our next generation live a happier and more fulfilling life than we do, let's fight even more bravely! We will never allow the American beasts to harm these adorable children of ours!

    为保卫祖国的孩子们而战斗
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  庞焕洲
    回到祖国以后，我们看到了许多英雄们创造出来的奇迹，听到了无数动人的事情。我们每个归国代表都深深地感到：祖国是更美丽了，更幸福了，更可爱了。我们为这样伟大的祖国感到骄傲，感到光荣。在许许多多动人的事例中，给我印象最深的，就是祖国的可爱的孩子们。
    在首都，我永远忘不了一位小朋友的献诗。那是在我给师范大学附属中学小朋友们介绍了朝鲜前线的情况以后，一个不比桌子高的小朋友跳上讲台朗诵的。诗的题目叫“我爱志愿军叔叔”。“我端起一碗白米饭，想起志愿军叔叔在前线，一口炒面一捧雪，为了我们去作战。
    ×××我们钻进被窝里睡得好香，叔叔们连夜打胜仗。我们睡醒天大亮，叔叔们歼敌一大片。
    ×××捎回的信儿看到了，全体队员感动得都哭了，妈妈也没你们好，喊完口号我们又笑了。
    ×××千山万水隔多远啊！幸福和勇敢紧相连。叔叔你勤捎回信呀，地图上找你找不见。………………………………
    朗诵的是那样热情，那样动听，那样有力量。我兴奋得眼泪都流出来了。
    我们永远忘不了西北各地儿童们天真可爱的影子。在西安市，我们被少年儿童队员邀请参观了“少年园”。他们拉着我们的手，一边走，一边指点着介绍：“这是我们捐献的儿童号飞机模型，不知道那位叔叔驾驶着它正打美国鬼子哩？”“这是我们自己动手造的小坦克、小火车、小铁轨。我们长大了要当航空员、坦克手、火车司机。”转了个弯，小手指向泥土制成的地理模型说：“咱们祖国真像一只美丽的大雄鸡。”“这是玉门，藏着用不完的煤油。”“这是新疆，出葡萄干很多，小朋友们都爱吃。”“这是陇海路，叔叔们就是从这条路上来的。”走到“理想校园”跟前，另一位小朋友介绍说：“这一排一排的是教室；这所大房子是图书馆，里面有好看的画报和儿童们爱看的书；这里是游戏场，皮球、秋千、天桥，什么设备都有；那边是花园，里面有一年四季开不败的花。我们一定要建设这样幸福的校园。”在屋子的一角，还陈列了儿童们精心采集的各种标本：红红绿绿的花草呀，小鸟儿呀，小虫儿呀……。啊，在毛主席教养下的儿童们是这么聪明，这么可爱！为了建设幸福的明天，他们已经显示出多么丰富的创造力！
    在兰州，儿童们每天都来看我们，争着和代表们握手，请代表们签名。谁都想送给代表像片和纪念章。每逢他们来了，房子里立刻充满了青春气象。唱歌呀，跳舞呀，掌声接着掌声，欢呼连着欢呼。如果赞美了谁几句，谁便天真地扑倒在你的怀里。一个不满八岁的儿童表演了“时刻准备为祖国立功劳”；一个九岁的儿童表演了“歌唱可爱的祖国”；另一个九岁的儿童边唱边舞，表演了“捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军”。在嘹亮的歌声中和活泼的舞蹈中，我们看出了他们对祖国的无比热爱，对前途的无限信任。在和他们一起相处的日子里，我们显得年青多了。
    在临夏市，当我们去参加儿童们特为我们筹备的联欢会时，一群儿童簇拥着把我们抬进会场，把我们抬到主席台上，把珍爱的红领巾束到我们?子上。有的孩子献出丝织的美丽的钢笔套。有的献出绣了边的小手帕。有的怕我们路上生病，每人给了两包仁丹。一个叫黄兰蕙的小姑娘，画了四张自己的像片，一旁写着：“志愿军叔叔，永远记着我们吧。”坐在我近旁的一个小姑娘把一张像片递到我手里说：“我很想到朝鲜去立功劳，只是身长不够，我要好好锻炼身体，努力的长，将来像王耀珍姐姐
    （她是十七岁的模范女护士，志愿军归国代表）一样，去打美国鬼子。”我为他们的热爱和英雄志向感动极了，情不自禁地大声喊出：“在伟大毛泽东时代的儿童，前途永远幸福光明！”散会了，多少儿童又围上来，小手里抓满了花生、糖果往我们口袋里装。他们把我们所有的口袋都塞得像皮球一样。
    祖国的孩子们非常关心朝鲜小朋友的生活和学习。小朋友张泪平和刘毅民，听到朝鲜六个儿童因为唱“金日成将军之歌”被美国兽兵割掉嘴唇、割断舌头、最后残杀了的消息后，攒紧小拳头对我们说：“志愿军叔叔，你们把我们带到朝鲜去吧！我们一块去打美国鬼子，替朝鲜儿童们报仇。”我们要费很多话才能使他们收回这种天真的、坚决的要求。有一天，一群儿童迳直跑到我们宿舍来了。看见我们，就急忙把几打铅笔递过来说：“叔叔们，我们听说朝鲜小朋友用木棍代替笔，用树叶代替纸，心里挺难过。我们买了几打铅笔，请叔叔们带给他们。以后节省下纸了，还寄给他们！”跟着，又来了一个叫黄兰辉的小姑娘，她用一块白手绢包了十支铅笔和一点纸，交给我们说：“叔叔，告诉朝鲜小朋友们吧，我们没忘了他们。”
    我听到了许多孩子在捐献飞机大炮运动中的感人的故事。还有成千成万的孩子把烈属、军属当成自己的父母一样看待。在热火朝天的“三反”“五反”运动中，不少孩子检举了贪污、盗窃分子。我们到某油矿时，接到了十二岁小学生孙振甲的来信。信上写着：“亲爱的志愿军叔叔们，在这次‘三反’运动中，我把我父亲的可耻的贪污行为检举了出来，我还检举了别人。我今天要向叔叔们保证：今后要用实际行动爱我们祖国：努力学习，锻炼身体，争取做一个模范少年儿童队员！”
    看到这一群一群的可爱的孩子们，我们都深深地感到祖国蕴藏着的后备力量的伟大，更加清楚地看到了祖国将来的美好，我们增加了新的勇气和力量。
    亲爱的朝鲜前线的同志们！为了使我们下一代比我们生活得更幸福，更美满，咱们更勇敢地战斗吧！我们绝不允许美国野兽来侵害我们这些可爱的孩子们！
