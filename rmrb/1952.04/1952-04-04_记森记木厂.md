    Record of the Senji Lumber Mill
    Zhou Libo
    The Senji Lumber Mill in Beijing's Gongxian Hutong is a level-three construction company. The manager, Kang Jiazhen, is a capitalist from an intellectual background. In the past, Senji sold firewood, then traded timber and made furniture. After liberation, it switched to the construction industry. By bribing some officials, Kang Jiazhen contracted many huge projects for military agencies. In the short two years from 1950 to 1951, this small shop that originally sold firewood developed into a construction company capable of contracting projects worth 6 billion.
    Like all private construction companies, Senji had a patriotic pact posted in its office, with grand pledges like "No tax evasion, no tax avoidance, no skimping on materials."
    Like all private construction companies, Senji employed very few people in its office, and important positions were held by the owner's confidants. When the "Five-Anti" movement began, Kang Jiazhen was not flustered at all. After returning from a meeting of representatives from industry and commerce, he said to his employees:
    "Senji has no problems, at most there will be a little bit of skimping on materials, which is unavoidable for any construction company."
    When the inspection team came to his office and wanted to see the accounts, he said:
    "Our accounts are a mess, if you want to check, I'll help you check."
    When the inspection team wanted to mobilize employees to participate in the "Five-Anti" movement, Kang Jiazhen said, "I'll help you mobilize them."
    During the day, when he saw the inspection team members wanted to smoke, he would quickly light a match for them; at night, when he saw that they had not brought quilts, he would offer them his own soft, warm cotton quilt.
    All of this left a good impression in the minds of individual team members with less experience in struggle. Some people began to see him as a relatively enlightened and "clean" capitalist.
    The inspection team also conducted interviews with Senji's neighbors, and the feedback was also favorable to him.
    Kang Jiazhen's seventeen-year-old daughter was studying at a middle school and was a member of the Youth League. The inspection team mobilized her to reason with her father, but Kang Jiazhen said: "You don't need to say anything, I know more than you." Indeed, Kang Jiazhen could say a lot of revolutionary principles, and he also said to the inspection team: "In Suiyuan, I have a good friend who is a Communist Party member." He also declared, "I have long wanted to participate in the revolution." When talking about his attitude towards the "Five-Anti" movement, he said: "I support the 'Five-Anti' movement. Without this 'Five-Anti' movement, China has no future." When it came to his own business, he said: "The construction industry is complicated, but I am also an amateur."
    Individual university professors on the inspection team estimated that he might actually be an amateur. Senji had only been engaged in the construction industry for two or three years, was in the process of building a reputation, and it was possible that he was completely law-abiding.
    The higher authorities sent more experienced comrades to strengthen the Senji inspection team. Although these newly added comrades were still young and had not been working for long, they had already inspected the Desheng Construction Company, and knew a little about the tricks of the trade and the tricks that owners might use. The manager of Desheng was a capitalist from a gangster background, and slightly different from Kang Jiazhen. Kang Jiazhen always dressed himself up nicely, making people think he was enlightened, but the boss of Desheng was not. Before the "Five-Anti" movement, he frankly said to his employees:
    "To do construction, you have to be steady, accurate, and ruthless."
    Could it be that the manager of Senji was an exception, not steady, not accurate, and not ruthless?
    The new comrades, together with the original comrades, patiently continued to inspect: checking accounts, calculating assets, looking at projects, questioning employees, conducting meticulous scientific investigation and research.
    During the investigation and research, they encountered one thing: a carpenter foreman named Yu Junxi at Senji. He had a bad temper. When the inspection team talked to him, he slammed the table, threw chairs, and said barbarously: "I just won't talk, you can arrest me and put me in jail." He also said: "Why don't you just move Senji away."
    When the inspection team was calculating accounts and talking in the room, Yu Junxi would sing and dance on the side to disrupt order.
    Everyone started to understand Yu Junxi and found that although he was from a carpentry background, in the past two years, he had profited at Senji, bought a house, and also acquired fifteen acres of land. He had become a running dog of the bourgeoisie and a traitor to the working class.
    Using traitors to make trouble, and pretending to be progressive himself, this was one of Kang Jiazhen's means of resisting the "Five-Anti" movement.
    But a person who does something wrong will sooner or later be exposed. Due to the leadership of the Party and the exposure of the workers, the inside story of Senji was gradually exposed. Part of their true accounts had already been burned. Before the inspection team arrived, Kang Jiazhen said to the workers: "You are workers, it doesn't matter if you talk nonsense."
    Due to lax prevention, even after the inspection team arrived, Kang Jiazhen often directed Yu Junxi on how to deal with things and how to deny them in the toilet. Once, in the toilet, he said: "The car in Tianjin has been sold."
    He bought a truck and parked it in Tianjin. Now he falsely claimed that it was sold, and asked Yu Junxi to say the same, to prove his honesty.
    Another time, also in the toilet, he said: "The furniture at the Bank of Communications can be mentioned."
    He mentioned a portion of the stolen goods, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. Furniture was one of them. He instructed Yu Junxi to say the same, to confirm his confession.
    Yet another time, still in the same toilet, he instructed Yu Junxi:
    "Your attitude towards them should be better."
    The toilet became Kang Jiazhen's command post for resisting the "Five-Anti" movement.
    No matter how clever Kang Jiazhen was, he could not withstand the inspection team's careful and scientific investigation. All kinds of facts have proven that although Kang Jiazhen was full of beautiful words, in stealing state assets and endangering national defense construction, he was as despicable and ferocious as other nouveau riche in the construction industry. He used banquets, gifts, money, and women to win over some degenerated cadres and contracted projects for many organs and schools affiliated to the Military Commission. In a short period of two years, he used methods such as inflated purchasing, overestimation, high estimation, skimping on materials, subcontracting, using inferior materials to replace good materials, and other kinds of deception and fraud to steal more than 1.9 billion yuan of state assets.
    Kang Jiazhen used letters of introduction from state organs to buy cement at low prices, exceeding the project needs by 50 percent, and then sold the surplus cement at high prices, earning huge profits. Once, when the market price of cement rose, he and the bribed cadres jointly revised the project plan to reduce the amount of cement used, and then took this batch of cement saved and sold it on the market, obtaining huge profits.
    For one project, 300 sheets of lead-iron were needed, but he reported 600 sheets, stealing 50 percent of them.
    The above are just examples of Kang Jiazhen's stealing behavior. All building materials, from cement, steel bars, and wood to the window bolts, he stole everything, and the amount of theft often exceeded 50 percent of the materials needed for the project. That is to say, he used state money to purchase building materials, sometimes only using half, and the other half, under the guise of a grand patriotic pact, he "happily" put into his own pocket.
    The houses built by this great thief are now either leaking rain or letting in wind, either with cracks in the walls or with sinking foundations, and many houses are in danger of collapsing and catching fire.
    Kang Jiazhen not only stole more than 1.9 billion in profits, but also seriously endangered the national defense construction of the motherland.
    Under the inspection team's hard and meticulous investigation and inquiry, Senji manager Kang Jiazhen was finally stripped of his "progressive" coat, his "enlightened" mask was removed, and he revealed the hideous face of a big robber, completely like other unscrupulous merchants.
    On the door frame outside the door of Kang Jiazhen's bedroom, there was a wooden plaque, engraved with two large characters painted in green: "Yun Xiu" (蕴秀, "containing elegance"). Based on Kang Jiazhen's despicable behavior of stealing state assets on a large scale and seriously endangering national defense construction, and based on his despicable means of conspiring to resist the "Five-Anti" movement in the toilet, the character "Xiu" (秀, "elegance") should be changed to "Chou" (臭, "stinky").
    "Yun Xiu" (蕴秀, "containing elegance") is Kang Jiazhen's disguise. "Yun Chou" (蕴臭, "containing stink") is Kang Jiazhen's true nature.
    Not only Kang Jiazhen is like this, but all illegal capitalists who pretend to be friends but are actually robbers are like this.
    The people of the whole country should clearly recognize this two-faced nature of the bourgeoisie in this great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    记森记木厂
    周立波
    北京弓弦胡同森记木厂是一家三级营造厂，经理康家珍是一个知识分子出身的资本家。从前，森记是卖劈柴的，后来贩木材，做家具，解放后，改作营造业。由于用行贿的手段拉拢了一些干部，康家珍承包了许多军事机关的巨大的工程。在一九五零年到一九五一年的短短的两年之间，这个原是卖劈柴的小铺子，发展成了能包六十亿工程的营造厂。
    正和一切私营的营造厂一样，森记的柜上张贴着爱国公约，写着“不偷税，不漏税，不偷工减料”等等堂皇的誓言。
    正和一切私营的营造厂一样，森记的柜上用人很少，重要的职务是由掌柜的心腹担任的。 “五反”运动开始时，康家珍一点不慌张。开完工商界代表会议回来，他对职工说：
    “森记没问题，顶多有一点点偷工减料，这是任何营造厂都免不了的。”
    检查组到他柜上，要看账目时，他说：
    “我们的账是本糊涂账，你们要查，我帮你们查。”
    检查组想要动员职工参加“五反”运动的时候，康家珍说：“我帮你们动员。”
    白天，他看到检查组的人要抽烟，自己连忙划洋火；晚上，看到他们没有带被子，就要把自己的松软的、温暖的棉被让给他们盖。
    这一切，在个别斗争经验较少的组员的心里，留下了良好的印象。有些人开始把他看成一位比较开明、比较“干净”的资本家。
    检查组又在森记的街坊邻居间进行了访问，大家的反映也是有利于他的。
    康家珍的十七岁的姑娘在中学念书，是青年团员。检查组的人动员她去跟她父亲说理，康家珍说：“你甭说，我比你懂得的还多。”真是这样，康家珍嘴巴上会说不少革命道理，他还对检查组的人说：“在绥远，我有一个好朋友，是共产党员。”他也宣称：“我早就想参加革命的。”谈到对于“五反”的态度时，他说：“我拥护‘五反’。没有这次‘五反’运动，中国是没有前途的。”涉及他的本行的时候，他说：“营造业是复杂的，可是我也是外行。”
    检查组的个别大学教授估计他也许真正是外行，森记从事营造业还只有两三年功夫，正在创名誉，立招牌，完全守法，也是可能的。
    上级又派了较有经验的同志来加强森记检查组。这些新添的同志，虽说还年轻，参加工作也不久，但他们已经检查过德盛营造厂，多少懂得这一行的门路，也多少懂得掌柜的们可能使用的花招。德盛的经理是个流氓出身的资本家，和康家珍略有不同，康家珍总是把自己装扮得漂漂亮亮，使人觉得他开明，德盛的老板却并不。在“五反”以前，他曾坦率地对职工们说：
    “干营造业，就得稳、准、狠。”
    难道森记的经理却是例外，不稳，不准，不狠了吗？
    新来的同志和原来的同志们一起，耐心地继续检查：查账目，算财产，看工程，问职工，进行细致的科学的调查研究。
    在调查研究中，他们碰到一件事情：森记一个木匠头，名叫于俊秀。他脾气很大，检查组跟他谈话的时候，他拍桌子，摔椅子，横蛮地说：“我就是不说，你们抓我坐牢吧。”又说：“你们干脆就把森记挪走得了呗。”
    检查组在房间里算账和谈话的时候，于俊秀就在一边唱歌和跳舞来扰乱秩序。
    大家着手了解于俊秀，发现他虽说是木匠出身，但这两年间，他在森记分了肥，买了房子，还置了十五亩地，他已经成了资产阶级的走狗，工人阶级的叛徒了。
    利用叛徒来捣乱，自己装进步，这是康家珍抗拒“五反”的手段的一种。
    但是一个人做了亏心事，迟早总得露馅的。由于党的领导和工友们的揭发，森记的内幕渐渐暴露了，他们柜上的一部分真账，已经被烧毁。检查组到来以前，康家珍就对工人说： “你们是工人，瞎说没关系。”
    由于防范不严密，检查组到来以后，康家珍还常常在厕所里指挥于俊秀怎样应付，如何抵赖。有一回，在厕所里，他说：“天津的汽车卖了。”
    他买了一辆卡车，寄放在天津，现在他诡称卖了，叫于俊秀也这样说，来证明他的诚实。
    又一回，也是在厕所里头，他说：“交通银行的家具可以说。”
    他避重就轻地说出了一部分赃物，家具是其中的一种，他吩咐于俊秀也这样说，来证实他的坦白。
    再有一回，还是在同一个厕所里，他吩咐于俊秀说道：
    “你对他们的态度要好一点。”
    厕所成了康家珍抗拒“五反”的指挥所。
    不管康家珍是怎样的高明，也抵挡不住检查组的精细的科学的调查。种种事实已经证明康家珍虽然满嘴漂亮话，但在盗窃国家资财，危害国防建设上，他和别的营造业的暴发户是同样的卑污和凶狠。他用酒席、礼物、金钱和女人拉拢了一些蜕化的干部，承包了军委所属的许多机关学校的工程。在短短的两年之内，他用套购，多估，高估，偷工，减料，转包，以次料顶好料和其他种种欺蒙讹诈的手段，盗窃了国家资财十九亿元以上。
    康家珍拿了国家机关的介绍信，廉价买进超过工程需要百分之五十的洋灰，再把这多余的洋灰高价卖出，赚得暴利。有一回，市场洋灰涨价了，他就和受贿的干部一起，共同修改工程计划，减少洋灰的用量，再拿这批省下的洋灰，到市场抛售，获取暴利。
    有一处工程，需要三百张铅铁，但他报了六百张，自己从中盗窃了百分之五十。
    以上不过是康家珍的偷盗行为的举例。所有建筑材料，从洋灰、钢筋、木材一直到窗上的插筲，他无不盗窃，而盗窃的数目往往超过工程需用物资的百分之五十，这就是说：他拿国家的金钱购买的建筑器材，有时候，只用一半，其余一半，他在堂皇的爱国公约的掩盖之下，“愉快”地装进了自己的腰包。
    这个大盗窃犯承修的房屋，现在不是漏雨，就是透风，不是墙壁裂缝，就是地基下沉，有许多房子，还有倒塌和失火的危险。
    康家珍不但盗窃了十九亿以上的暴利，而且严重地危害了祖国的国防建设。
    在检查组的辛勤而细致的调查和询问之下，森记经理康家珍终于被剥去了“进步”的外衣，揭开了“开明”的假面，露出了和别的奸商完全一样的大强盗的狰狞的嘴脸。
    在康家珍的卧室门外的门斗上，挂着一块木匾，上面刻镂着两个涂成绿色的大字：“蕴秀”。根据康家珍的大量偷盗国家资财，严重危害国防建设的卑污的行为，根据他在厕所里阴谋抗拒“五反”的龉龊的手段，“秀”字应改成“臭”字。
    “蕴秀”，这是康家珍的幌子。 “蕴臭”，这是康家珍的底子。
    不光是康家珍是这个样子，所有一切伪装朋友，实做强盗的违法资本家，都是这样子。
    全国人民都应该在毛主席、共产党领导的这次
    “三反”和“五反”的伟大运动中，清楚地认识资产阶级的这副阴阳脸。
