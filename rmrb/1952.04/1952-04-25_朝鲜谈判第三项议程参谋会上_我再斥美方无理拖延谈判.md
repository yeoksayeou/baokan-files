Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 24th: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 24th, our side pointed out: "On the various agendas in the negotiations, our side has exhausted all efforts to achieve an early armistice in Korea to satisfy the wishes of peace-loving people around the world. However, your side has adopted an attitude of unwillingness to solve problems on various agendas, insisting on your unreasonable demands, so that the armistice negotiations cannot make any progress." Our side once again pointed out our firm stance and reasonable solutions on the remaining issues of the third agenda item, demanding that the other side withdraw its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs, and seriously consider our reasonable solutions to the issue of neutral nation nominations.
	At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the two sides continued to exchange views on the issue of prisoner repatriation. The meeting ended without result.

    朝鲜谈判第三项议程参谋会上
    我再斥美方无理拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方指出：“在谈判中的各项议程上，我方已经竭尽了一切的努力，争取早日实现朝鲜停战，以满足全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。但你方却在各项议程中采取了不愿解决问题的态度，坚持你方的无理要求，以致停战谈判不可能有所进展。”我方再次指出我方在第三项议程剩余问题上的坚决立场和合理解决方案，要求对方撤回其干涉我方内政的无理要求，并郑重考虑我方对中立国提名问题的合理解决方案。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方继续就遣俘问题交换意见，会议无结果。
