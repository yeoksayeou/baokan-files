    The Great "Three-Anti" Movement Gave Me a New Life
    Ma Wenguang
    I am Ma Wenguang, working in the Supply and Sales Department of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry. I am a major embezzler who stole more than 270 million yuan of state funds.
    From childhood to adulthood, I studied in church schools, receiving a series of enslaving educations. I extremely admired the "material civilization" of imperialism and only wanted to be a "superior Chinese." The old society and the bourgeois family further influenced me into a selfish person who took pride in exploiting others. Although I put on the guise of a "revolutionary cadre" after liberation, I did not study diligently or seek reform. I still longed for that corrupt and degenerate life of the past, which planted the seeds of corruption in my heart.
    In April 1950, I joined the procurement work of the Supply and Sales Department of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry. Over the past year, I have handled funds amounting to several billion yuan. In September 1950, I accepted the task of purchasing books for the basic construction department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The prices of the books were mostly estimated, and the prices could only be determined after the books were delivered. I could withdraw large amounts of money from the accounting department under the item of "temporary payment." This opportunity secretly pleased me, so I had corrupt behavior—embezzling public funds. Later, seeing that no one was asking about the book purchase, and the superiors and comrades trusted me very much, my courage grew, and I had even greater corrupt behavior.
    At the beginning of embezzling and squandering, I didn't feel scared. Later, as the amount gradually increased, although I had a sense of fear, it was diluted by the "fantasy" of a world war. This "fantasy" did not last long. With the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad and the disastrous defeat of the invading US military in Korea, I gradually felt the seriousness of my crime. But at this time, I had already squandered a lot of the stolen money, thinking, "This will not be discovered!" I also often inquired at various bookstores, knowing that no one from my organization had come to investigate my affairs, so I felt more at ease. During last year's "Loyalty and Honesty" study movement, fear arose again. I wanted to confess my problems, but I didn't have the courage because I was afraid of losing "face" and being punished. Later, I requested to study at cadre school or participate in land reform to avoid it temporarily, but it was not approved. The matter was dragged on.
    The "Three-Anti" movement began, and I was very uneasy, but I did not dare to confess. I went to the bookstores again and found that no one from my organization had inquired about it. I thought to myself, "My situation is different from others. Only I know about this matter, and I haven't formed a 'defense alliance' with anyone, so I won't be denounced." I also fantasized that the movement would pass like a gust of wind and be over, so I would wait and see. So in my studies, I tried to pretend to be active and denounced others to cover myself up. I also watched the faces of my superiors to see if their attitude towards me had changed. At this time, I was really confused and restless. Even on January 20th, I had the foolish idea of swallowing gold to commit suicide the next day because I was afraid of being arrested at the anti-corruption conference of the whole bureau, trying to escape responsibility by this means. Before attending the anti-corruption struggle meeting on the 21st, I secretly put a photo of each member of my family in my pocket. Before leaving, I hugged my child a little longer and kissed him a few more times, preparing to be arrested at the meeting. At the meeting, seeing the masses' indignation towards corrupt elements and the intensity of the struggle, I felt extremely frightened. I began to feel that "fooling around" was not an option, and I had to confess my problems. After the meeting, I found an old friend of many years, and her enlightenment gave me the initial determination to confess. After returning home, I told my wife about my embezzlement, and after another night of painful ideological struggle, I made up my mind to confess. Early the next morning, I found Director Chen and told him about my corrupt behavior. But at that time, I was unwilling to admit that I had embezzled, saying that I had "misappropriated public funds," and I also concealed some of the facts of the embezzlement. Later, with the help of comrades and the persuasion of my parents and wife, I honestly told everything and also denounced others. Only then did I put down that sinful burden. At the mobilization meeting of the Ministry of Heavy Industry on March 5th, I had the opportunity to openly confess and examine myself to the masses, and I received lenient treatment from the government. I am determined to do everything possible to ensure that all the stolen money and goods I embezzled are returned.
    Now, I truly thank the government for its leniency towards me. According to my preliminary calculation, the state property I embezzled is equivalent to the salary of a cadre with a monthly salary of 300 catties of millet for sixty years. If the huge sum of money I embezzled were used for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea or national construction, it would be an effective force. The fruits of victory won by countless martyrs and working people with their lives and blood were stolen and squandered by corrupt elements like us. Others are building the motherland, but we are destroying the motherland's construction. I ask myself, a person as guilty as I am should be subject to the most severe sanctions of the people's laws. Even death cannot reduce my sins and make up for the damage to the country and the people. However, the government gave me lenient treatment. To me, a sinner with dirty hands, because I was able to thoroughly confess and return the stolen money, I was reduced from the death penalty to five years in prison, and even given a three-year reprieve. Recently, I was even allowed to participate in the battle to fight "tigers" and given the opportunity to continue working and atone for my sins. I sincerely feel the government's magnanimity. I truly see that the "Three-Anti" movement has saved countless corrupt elements. Countless corrupt elements have been reborn because they thoroughly confessed, poured out the stolen money, and sincerely repented. But there are still a few corrupt criminals who are still stubborn. The government and the people are still trying their best to save them, hoping that they will take the path of Hang Xiaozu and Xia Maoru, and not the path of Xue Kunshan and Song Degui. The final moment has arrived. Those corrupt criminals who refuse to confess and refuse to return the stolen money, you should see from me what your possible future is.
    Now, in addition to sincerely feeling the deep kindness of the government and the people towards me, I must do a good job in fighting "tigers" and return all the stolen money as soon as possible to show my understanding and repentance of my sins. In the future, I must truly join the revolutionary ranks, intensify my transformation, abandon my personal interests, and be a servant of the people, to compensate for the losses I have caused to the people.

### 伟大的“三反”运动使我得到了新生

    伟大的“三反”运动使我得到了新生
    马文光
    我叫马文光，在中央重工业部钢铁工业局工作，是一个盗窃国家两亿七千多万元的大贪污分子。
    从小到大，我一直在教会学校读书，受了一系列的奴化教育。我极端崇拜帝国主义的“物质文明”，只想做一个“高等华人”。旧社会和资产阶级的家庭，更把我熏染成一个自私自利、以剥削他人为荣的人。解放后虽然披上了“革命干部”的外衣，但自己并没有认真学习，也没有求得改造，仍留恋过去那种腐化堕落的生活，这就在心里种下了贪污的种籽。
    一九五零年四月，我参加了中央重工业部钢铁工业局供销处的采购工作。一年多来，经手金额达数十亿元。一九五零年九月，我接受了为太原钢铁厂基本建设处购买书籍的任务。书价多为估价，待书运到后才能定价。我可以从会计科以“暂付款”的科目支出大批款项。这种机会，使我暗中高兴，于是有了贪污行为——挪用公款。后来见没有人过问买书的事情，上级和同志们又对我很信任，于是我的胆子大起来，也就有了更大的贪污行为。
    在起初贪污、挥霍时，心里并不感到可怕。后来数目逐渐增多，虽有了恐惧心理，但因对世界大战有着“幻想”，恐惧心理也就冲淡了。这种“幻想”为时不久，随着志愿军出国、侵朝美军惨败而粉碎，心里才逐渐感到罪恶的重大。但这时已把赃款挥霍很多了，心想：“这事不会被发觉的！”又常到各书店探询，知道本机关并没有人来调查过自己的事，就更放心了。去年“忠诚老实”学习运动时，惧怕心理又发生了。想交代问题，没有勇气，因为又怕丢“面子”，又怕受到惩办。后来便要求到干部学校学习或参加土地改革，暂避一避，结果没被批准。事情便一直拖了下来。
    “三反”运动开始了，我十分不安，但也不敢交代。到各书店跑了一趟，知道本机关仍没有人来查问过。心里就这样想：“我的情形和别人不同，这事只我一人知道，又没和人订‘攻守同盟’，不会被检举的。”更幻想运动会像一阵风一样，刮过去就完事，还是看看风头再说吧。于是在学习中尽量装积极，还检举了别人，想打掩护；又看上级的脸色，是否对我的态度有了变化。这时真是心乱如麻，坐立不安。甚至在一月二十日，自己因怕在次日全局反贪污大会上被捕，有过愚蠢的吞金自杀的念头，想借此逃脱罪责。二十一日参加反贪污斗争大会之前，偷偷地把家里每个人的像片装了一张，出门前又特别多抱了孩子一会，多吻了他几下，准备在会上被捕。在会上，看到群众对贪污分子的愤慨，斗争情绪的激烈，自己感到恐惧万分，我开始感到“混”是不行的，必须交代问题。会后，我找到一位多年的老友，由于她的启发，使我有了初步坦白的决心。回家后向妻子说出了自己贪污的事实，又经过一夜痛苦的思想斗争，下定了交代问题的决心。第二天清早就找到陈处长，向他谈出我的贪污行为。但当时还不愿说自己贪污，而说“挪用公款”，而且贪污事实还有所保留。后来又经过同志们的帮助，父、母、妻子的劝说，才老老实实地说出了一切，还检举了别人。这样才把那个罪恶包袱放下。在三月五日重工业部的动员大会上，我又得到了向群众公开坦白检讨的机会，并得到政府宽大的处理。我决心用尽一切办法，保证全部退出我贪污的赃款赃物。
    现在，我真正感谢政府对我的宽大。据我初步计算，我所贪污的国家财产，相当于一个月薪资三百斤小米的干部六十年的薪资。如果把我贪污的巨款用在抗美援朝或国家建设上去，将是一份有效的力量。无数先烈及劳动人民用生命和血汗换来的胜利果实，却被我们这些贪污分子盗窃挥霍掉了。别人在建设祖国，我们却在破坏祖国建设。扪心自问，像我这样的罪大恶极的人，应受到人民法律的最严厉的制裁，真是虽死也不能减轻自己的罪恶，和挽回对国家人民的损害。但是，政府对我作了宽大处理。对我这个满手肮脏的罪人，因为我能彻底坦白，退还赃款，由死刑减到五年有期徒刑，更予以缓期三年执行。最近更允许我参加了打“虎”的战斗，并给我以继续工作、戴罪立功的机会。我真切地体会到政府的宽大为怀。我也真正看清了“三反”运动挽救了无数的贪污分子。无数的贪污分子由于他们彻底坦白、倒出赃款、真诚悔过而得到了新生。但仍有少数贪污犯依然执迷不悟，政府和人民还在尽力挽救他们，希望他们走杭效祖、夏茂如的路，不要走薛昆山、宋德贵的路。已经到了最后的时刻了，那些拒不坦白和拒不倒赃的贪污犯，你们应从我身上看出你们可能的前途。
    我现在除了衷心感到政府和人民对我的深恩以外，我一定做好打“虎”工作，并尽早全部倒出赃款，以表示对自己罪恶的认识和改悔。今后更要真正投入革命队伍里，加紧改造自己，抛弃个人的私利，做一个人民群众的勤务员，以偿还曾给人民所造成的损失。
