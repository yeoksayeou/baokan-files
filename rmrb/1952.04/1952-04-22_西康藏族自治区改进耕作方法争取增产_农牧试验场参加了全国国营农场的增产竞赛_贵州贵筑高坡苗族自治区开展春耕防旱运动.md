    The Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region held its first regional production conference from April 5th to 11th. Representatives of farmers, herdsmen, and lamas from eighteen counties attended the conference. The conference determined to vigorously develop agricultural production and the production of local and special products in the autonomous region, protect livestock, and launch a movement for human and animal health and epidemic prevention. The region originally planned to increase grain production by 1,000 tons this year, but after discussion at the conference, it was decided to increase the production target to 2,000 tons. To complete this expanded production plan, the conference decided to reclaim 25,000 mu of wasteland this year, and to learn from the production experience of the interior, calling on farmers to change from broadcast sowing to spot sowing and row sowing, to apply more fertilizer and weed more frequently to increase yield per unit area. Farmer representatives from various places participating in the conference exchanged production experiences with each other, and Han farmers gave them practical demonstrations of farming methods in Han areas. The Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government also presented each representative with a set of iron farm tools.
    In order to strengthen leadership over the patriotic production increase movement in various places, the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government decided to send production guidance work teams to various counties to guide farmers in operations, and decided to establish state-owned farms in fourteen counties including Ganzi, Litang, and Kangding.
    The Agricultural and Pastoral Experiment Farm of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region has already joined the national state-owned farm production increase competition.
    This agricultural and pastoral experiment farm is the first relatively large-scale and well-equipped farm on the Kangzang Plateau. In order to provide an example and create conditions for local Tibetan farmers to carry out the patriotic production increase competition movement, the main conditions they proposed for participating in the competition are, first of all, to ensure that they do a good job in experimental work such as improving plateau soil, preventing freezing and insect pests for local Tibetan farmers, and cultivating various improved varieties with drought resistance, disease resistance and cold-resistant pasture grasses for promotion to Tibetan farmers. In addition, they guarantee that the farm's highland barley yield will be 200 jin per mu, wheat will yield 250 jin per mu, peas will yield 300 jin per mu, and potatoes will yield 3,000 jin per mu. These yields are 90% to 110% higher than the local average yields. This year, the farm will also try to plant Soviet spring wheat, rye, oats and other cold-resistant crops for promotion on the Kangzang Plateau.
    Currently, farmers in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region are engaged in spring ploughing and sowing. The main sowing areas include the valleys of the Dadu River, Jinsha River, and Yalong River, as well as the six agricultural counties in the south, such as Daocheng, with the exception of a small portion of mountainous areas. Baiyu, Dengke, Ganzi and other counties are intensively sowing.
    This year, farmers in this autonomous region have begun to adopt progressive farming methods. Now, they are working hard to complete the region's plan to increase grain production by 2,000 tons.

    Guizhou Province Guizhu County Gaopo Miao Autonomous Region farmers, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, are widely carrying out the spring ploughing and drought prevention movement.
    The Gaopo Autonomous Region is all high mountains, inhabited by more than 8,000 Miao farmers and a small number of Han farmers. Before liberation, farmers lacked both draught cattle and farm tools, and also lacked food for the spring ploughing season. This situation has changed since liberation. This year, the Guizhu County People's Government has issued a large number of loans and food loans to the farmers in the autonomous region to support their spring ploughing production. The loans issued by the People's Government to the autonomous region are several times higher than those in other general areas.
    Due to the strong assistance of the People's Government, the farmers in the autonomous region have greatly increased their confidence in spring ploughing and drought prevention. This year, all the fields that can be plowed in the region have been plowed once, and the area sown by each household and the amount of fertilizer accumulated have increased by more than double compared to last year. Currently, farmers throughout the region have prepared their rice paddies and are sowing seeds. Many Miao women are still lighting torches late at night to draw water to make rice paddies.
    Recently, the autonomous region held a meeting of farmer representatives, calling for increased production. The meeting requested that the region apply more fertilizer, plow more, weed more, continue to find water sources, and repair ponds to prevent drought this year, to ensure a 10% increase in production.

    西康藏族自治区改进耕作方法争取增产
    农牧试验场参加了全国国营农场的增产竞赛
    贵州贵筑高坡苗族自治区开展春耕防旱运动
    西康省藏族自治区在四月五日到十一日举行了全区第一届生产会议，出席会议的有十八个县的农民、牧民和喇嘛的代表。会议确定大力发展自治区的农业生产和土产、特产的生产，保护牲畜，并开展人、畜卫生防疫运动。全区原计划今年增产粮食一千吨，经会议讨论后决定把增产数字提高为二千吨。为完成这个扩大了的增产计划，会议决定今年全区开荒二万五千亩，并吸取内地生产经验，号召农民改撒播为点播和条播，多施肥、多锄草，以提高单位面积产量。参加会议的各地农民代表都互相交流了生产经验，并由汉族农民为他们实地演习了汉族地区的耕作方法。藏族自治区人民政府又赠送了每个代表一套铁器农具。
    为加强对各地爱国增产运动的领导，藏族自治区人民政府决定派出生产指导工作队到各县指导农民操作，并决定在甘孜、理塘、康定等十四个县成立国营农场。
    西康省藏族自治区的农牧试验场，已经参加了全国国营农场的增产竞赛。
    这个农牧试验场，是康藏高原第一个规模较大、设备较好的农场。为了给高原藏族农民开展爱国增产竞赛运动提供榜样和创造条件，他们所提参加竞赛的主要条件，首先是保证为当地藏族农民做好改良高原土壤、防御冰冻和虫害等试验工作，并培殖各种具有抗旱、抗病的良种和耐寒的牧草，以便向藏族农民推广。另外，他们保证今年农场所种的青稞每亩产二百斤、小麦产二百五十斤、豌豆产三百斤，洋芋产三千斤。这些产量都比当地一般产量高百分之九十到百分之一百一十。今年，该场还要试种苏联的春季小麦、黑麦、燕麦等高寒作物，以便在康藏高原上推广。
    现在，西康省藏族自治区的农民正在春耕播种。大渡河和金沙江、雅砻江诸流域以及南部稻城等六个农业县，除小部分山地外，其余都已播种完毕。白玉、邓柯、甘孜等县正在紧张地播种。
    今年，这个自治区的农民已开始采用了进步的耕作方法。现在，他们正为完成全区增产粮食二千吨的计划而努力。    （据新华社消息）
    贵州省贵筑县高坡苗族自治区农民，在人民政府领导和帮助下，广泛开展春耕防旱运动。
    高坡自治区都是高山，住着八千多苗族农民和少数汉族农民。解放前，每年春耕农民既缺耕牛、农具，又缺口粮。解放后这个情况变了。今年，贵筑县人民政府曾给自治区的农民，发放了大批贷款和贷粮，扶持他们春耕生产。人民政府发给自治区的贷款，比其他一般地区的数目多几倍。
    由于人民政府的大力帮助，自治区农民的春耕防旱信心大大增强。今年，全区能犁的田都已犁过一道，各户播种的面积和所积的肥大部分都比去年增加一倍以上。现在，全区农民都已打好秧田正在播种。许多苗族妇女深夜还点着火把戽水做秧田。
    最近，自治区召开了一次农民代表会议，号召提高生产。会议要求全区今年多施肥、多犁、多薅、继续找水源、修塘防旱，保证增产百分之十。
