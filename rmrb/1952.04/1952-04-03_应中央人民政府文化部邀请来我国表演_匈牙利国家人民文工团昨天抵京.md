Introduction to the Hungarian National People's Song and Dance Ensemble

The Hungarian People's Republic National People's Song and Dance Ensemble was established in October 1950 and consists of a choir, a folk dance troupe, and a folk orchestra. It was established on the basis of the widespread development of amateur art movements among the working people throughout Hungary.

After the liberation of Hungary, the cultural and artistic life of the broad masses of people, which had previously been almost completely stifled, took on a vigorous new look. Thousands of amateur cultural and artistic groups were established in factories, villages, and schools throughout the country, and many artistic geniuses and outstanding mass art creations emerged. All of Hungary also holds an annual "Judgment Meeting." At the meeting, dance troupes and singing groups from various cultural and artistic groups across the country compete to discover which groups are best at using national and mass art to express their love for the motherland, their struggle to defend peace, and their free and happy new life in their dances and songs.

The members of the Hungarian National People's Song and Dance Ensemble were selected from among 3,000 singers and dancers from amateur cultural and artistic groups across the country. They were originally young workers, farmers, and students. The leaders of the Song and Dance Ensemble were also organizers and leaders of the best folk cultural and artistic groups in the past.

After its establishment, the Hungarian National People's Song and Dance Ensemble has maintained extremely close ties with the broad masses of working people and is loved by them. It often goes on tour to villages throughout the country, learning new creations from the people while bringing refined and improved art to the people. It has visited the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic for performance visits. At the World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin in 1951, the ensemble's orchestra won first prize, and the dance won second prize. The delegation that was invited to perform in China this time has a total of 135 people, and the leader is Seresi Gyula. Other responsible personnel include artistic director Rábai Miklós, music director Frenreisz Imre, and orchestra conductor Gujas László. The ensemble will perform music and dance in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places for about a month.

    匈牙利国家人民文工团昨天抵京
    【新华社二日讯】应中央人民政府文化部邀请来我国表演的匈牙利人民共和国国家人民文工团在二日下午六时抵达北京。
    到车站欢迎的有中央人民政府文化部办公厅主任、中华全国文学艺术界联合会秘书长沙可夫，政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局局长洪深，中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩，文化部艺术事业管理局副局长张光年，中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院院长李伯钊，中华全国舞蹈工作者协会主席戴爱莲，外交部交际处副处长魏宝善，以及各人民团体、部队、学生和首都文艺工作者的代表共一千八百多人。
    匈牙利驻华大使夏法朗柯和使馆人员，朝鲜名舞蹈家崔承喜等也到车站欢迎。
    文工团全体人员下车后，在热烈的掌声中，接受了少年儿童队的献花。接着在车站举行了简单的欢迎会。沙可夫代表中央人民政府文化部和中华全国文学艺术界联合会致欢迎词说：你们的到来将会使中匈两国人民之间的友谊获得更进一步的巩固和发展，并加强我们保卫世界和平和建设美好生活的共同事业。接着匈牙利人民共和国国家人民文工团团长歇勒西·纠腊致答词说：我们是从一万六千公里以外的地方来的。尽管如此，匈牙利人民对于中国人民还是感觉很亲切的。这是由于我们两国都在为共同的目标而斗争的缘故。我们将在中国表演匈牙利人民的歌舞，并将向有数千年文化的中国的艺术学习。
    匈牙利国家人民文工团介绍
    匈牙利人民共和国国家人民文工团成立于一九五○年十月，组成部分有合唱队、民间舞蹈队和民间管弦乐队。它是在匈牙利全国劳动人民的业余艺术运动广泛发展的基础上建立起来的。
    匈牙利解放后，从前几乎完全被窒息了的广大人民的文化艺术生活有了蓬勃的新气象。全国各地的工厂、农村和学校中成立了数以千计的业余文化艺术团体，涌现了许多艺术天才和优秀的群众艺术创作。全匈牙利还每年举行一次“评判会”。会上，各地的各种文化艺术团体的舞蹈队和歌咏队展开竞赛，以便在他们的舞蹈和歌咏中发现那些团体最善于运用民族的大众的艺术来表现对祖国的热爱、保卫和平的斗争和他们自由愉快的新生活。
    匈牙利国家人民文工团的团员就是从全国各地业余文化艺术团体的三千个歌唱家和舞蹈家当中挑选出来的。他们原来是年青的工人、农民和学生。文工团的领导人也都是从前最优秀的民间文化艺术团体的组织者和领导者。
    匈牙利国家人民文工团成立后，和广大的劳动人民有着极其密切的联系，并受到他们的热爱。它经常到全国各村庄作巡回演出，一面学习人民的新创作，一面把加工和提高了的艺术带给人民。它曾经到过苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国作访问表演。在一九五一年柏林举行的世界青年与学生和平联欢节中，该团的管弦乐队获得了一等奖，舞蹈获得了二等奖。此次应邀来我国表演的人员共有一百三十五人，团长是歇勒西·纠腊，其他负责人员包括艺术导演腊巴依·米克洛希，音乐指挥前基·依墨莱，管弦乐总指挥古亚士·拉斯罗。该团将在北京、上海等地作一个月左右的音乐、舞蹈表演。
