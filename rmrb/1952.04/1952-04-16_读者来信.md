    Summary of Readers' Letters
    People of All Ethnic Groups in China Unanimously Oppose the United States' Germ Warfare
The people of all ethnic minorities in our country unanimously oppose the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in launching germ warfare. Our newspaper has successively received a large number of letters from readers of ethnic minorities, expressing their determination to eliminate American germ warfare.
    The Student Union of the Central Institute for Nationalities wrote: "We cannot tolerate the bestial acts of the American bandits. We—the students of the thirty-three ethnic groups of the Central Institute for Nationalities—are determined to strengthen the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea, study hard, strengthen our bodies, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time to support the Volunteers and strike at the American aggressors." All teachers, students, and staff of the Beijing Hui Nationality College wrote: "In addition to studying hard, mastering science and technology, and responding to the call of the motherland at any time, we will do everything in our power to support the Volunteers. We will join the people of the world to cut off the bloody hands of the American aggressors." All representatives of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and the District Peasant Representatives of Longsheng County Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, wrote: "We, the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, swear to the people of the whole country and to Chairman Mao: We guarantee to do a good job in production, complete the production tasks for 1952, enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, and fight to crush the germ warfare of the American aggressors." Cui Zuoyu of the Second Junior Middle School in Huaning County, Yunnan Province, wrote: "Our school is a school with a majority of ethnic minority students. After hearing the news of the American bandits spreading germs, we immediately held a meeting to denounce the crimes of American imperialism. We unanimously support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and resolutely oppose the American aggressors' germ warfare." Wang Ming and Ma Zhongjie of Qingshui County, Gansu Province, wrote: "We, the 20,000 Hui youth of Zhangjiachuan in Qingshui County, are determined to do a good job in this year's spring plowing production, increase the yield per unit area, actively participate in mutual aid teams, help the families of revolutionary martyrs do a good job in spring plowing, divert water from rivers, build small-scale water conservancy projects, do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, and do a good job in forest protection, guaranteeing that each person plants and keeps alive three trees, and other practical actions to protest the crime of the American bandits spreading germs." The Ethnic Affairs Committee of Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, wrote: "We hope that all ethnic groups in the country will further strengthen their solidarity, do a good job in production, and support the Volunteers to completely annihilate the American aggressors."
    All Employees of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 10
    Greet the "May Day" Festival with Practical Actions
Editor: Just as American imperialism is carrying out inhumane germ warfare on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China, the great festival of our working class—"May Day" Labor Day—is approaching. All the employees of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 10 are using practical actions to greet the "May Day" festival. Workshops and groups have successively proposed challenges and response conditions, and the entire factory has been swept into a high tide of competition to greet "May Day." The model group of the Third Workshop guarantees to complete the April production task five days in advance, with a quality of 100%, and to make ten hook-shaped calipers before "May Day" as a gift to greet "May Day." The Eighth Workshop guarantees to reduce the scrap rate by 3.5% and do a good job in machine maintenance. The Second Workshop and the Fifth Workshop guarantee to complete the April production task in advance, the former also guaranteeing to reduce the scrap rate by 80% and do a good job in training new apprentices. The First Workshop guarantees to exceed the April production task by 15% to 20% and improve the quality by 30%. The workers guarantee to achieve these plans to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" struggle. Zhao Baoqi
    Workers of the Northeast Clothing Bureau Experimental Factory Guarantee to Complete the April Production Task in Advance
Editor: We workers lived a life worse than cattle and horses in the old society, suffering from exploitation and oppression. In the three years since liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao have led us, educated us, and cultivated us, enabling us to improve in all aspects. Politically, we are the leading class; culturally, we can all participate in cultural studies and attend various schools; economically, our wages are increasing every year, and now we can eat rice. There are many such vivid examples. Taking our Northeast Clothing Bureau Experimental Factory as an example, workers Zhao Liancheng, Wu Suyan, and others have all participated in the factory management committee. Worker Liu Xihua has completed his studies at the political school and is now doing leadership work in the factory. After this great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement, we have a deeper understanding of the greatness of the Party. All our employees are now working happily, and we are determined to carry the movement through to the end, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory. We are determined to do a good job in epidemic prevention and complete the April production task two days in advance as a gift to Chairman Mao and "May Day."

    Employees of the First Workshop of the First Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau
    Challenge All Factory and Mining Employees in the City to Greet "May Day"
Editor: The workers of the First Workshop of the First Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau in Shenyang City, in the "Three-Anti" movement, have been in high spirits for production, launched a production competition, and completed the first quarter's production task in advance. In order to greet "May Day" Labor Day with practical actions and consolidate the victorious results of the "Three-Anti," the employees of the First Workshop have drafted conditions to challenge other workshops in the factory and all factory and mining employees in the city: (1) Guarantee to do a good job in epidemic prevention and workshop environmental sanitation, leaving no dirt or ash in the workshop; (2) Guarantee to install more × lathes, exceeding the original plan by 13%. Rationally organize labor, do not waste manpower, and prepare for May production; (3) Guarantee to improve product quality by 75%, strengthen the "Four-Prevention" work, and prevent any accidents; (4) Actively participate in the "tiger-beating" work.

    Qian Danhui, Former President of the Former Southern Anhui Daily
    Poor Quality Hinders the "Three-Anti" Movement
    Local Party Committee Should Handle It Quickly
Editor: Qian Danhui, the former president of the former Southern Anhui Daily, used the name of "organizational production" to embezzle public funds, engage in illegal business operations, and cruelly exploit employees; during the "Three-Anti" period, he not only did not confess his problems but also resisted the movement.
    The funds for Qian Danhui's business operations came partly from exploiting workers. From August to November 1949, the government issued rice as wages to workers. Qian Danhui used methods such as changing the issuance of money instead of rice and using large scales to buy in and small scales to sell out to exploit workers, totaling more than 14 million yuan; he also squeezed more than 17 million yuan from workers' night meal fees, food allowances, and staff welfare funds. Another part of the funds was stolen from operating expenses. The surplus funds of the Tunxi "Xinhua Telegraph" and the Southern Anhui Daily's newspaper fees and business income for three months in 1949, totaling more than 9 million yuan, were all turned into his capital for speculative trading. Qian Danhui also openly instructed Chief Accountant Lü Xingzhen to issue fake invoices and create fake receipts to steal the Party Committee's propaganda funds as income for "organizational production."
    In February 1950, Qian Danhui hoarded a batch of cotton yarn. In order to evade government inspection, he hid the yarn in the attic of his dormitory. He bought cotton yarn worth 7.2 million yuan from the China Trade Corporation and made a profit of 6.9 million yuan in one transaction. In 1950, after Shanghai was bombed by enemy planes, Qian Danhui estimated that kerosene prices would rise, so he sent people to Shanghai to hoard kerosene and also hoarded kerosene, rice, flour, cloth, and other items in Wuhu City.
    Qian Danhui's political character is extremely bad. In 1950, he returned from Yijishan after recovering from illness. Near his residence, there was a shop that opened a radio because it was the first day of business. Many citizens gathered there to listen. He believed that the radio disturbed his peace and ordered the correspondent and the deputy director of the newspaper's printing plant to stop it. He even personally picked up a carbine and fired at the crowd, creating a very bad influence. Qian Danhui usually regarded himself as the only one, and when he heard others criticize or accuse him, he used the label of "lack of organization and discipline" to suppress people. When he saw a few comrades gathering together for a casual chat, he thought: "This is a small group activity, there is a problem." At the editorial board and the party committee meeting, he often slammed the table and scolded the editorial board comrades. He did not pay attention to the education of newly joined cadres and often cursed at them.
    After the "Three-Anti" movement began, he did not examine his mistakes but took various measures to suppress democracy and hinder the "Three-Anti" movement.
    We cannot tolerate Qian Danhui's wrong behavior. We demand that the leading organs give Qian Danhui the punishment he deserves.

    Manzhouli Railway Station is Irresponsible for Joint Transport Goods
    Relevant Departments Should Handle It Quickly
Editor: Since the opening of Sino-Soviet railway joint transport business in April last year, a large number of construction materials have been continuously transported from the friendly Soviet Union to our country. When these materials are transshipped at Manzhouli Railway Station, the joint transport goods are often extremely chaotic because the station personnel do not follow the regulations and work carelessly. Taking the joint transport goods arriving at our Tianjin Station as an example, errors such as discrepancies between the records on the bill of lading and the actual goods, goods without bills, bills without goods, and inconsistent codes often occur. We have repeatedly telegraphed to inquire, but the station ignored them and did not try to correct the errors. In addition, the comrades in charge of handling joint transport accidents at the Tianjin Railway Administration are procrastinating, resulting in many imported goods that cannot be delivered to our station to this day. We have reported these situations to the Tianjin Railway Administration verbally and by telephone dozens of times, and we have also reported them in writing four or five times, and we have also reported them to the International Joint Transport Office of the Ministry of Railways, but the problems have not been resolved. The resulting losses are shocking: for example, the storage fee for certain equipment arriving on November 12 last year has reached more than 310 million yuan to date. These useful industrial equipment are urgently needed by many factories, but now they are being accumulated in our station. If they are not handled quickly, they will become waste. Are the above-mentioned units indifferent and do not think this is a waste? In the great "Three-Anti" struggle, is such irresponsible bureaucratic style still allowed? We ask them to handle these accumulated goods and answer in the newspaper the reasons for the delay in handling them.

    读者来信
    我国各兄弟民族人民一致反对美国进行细菌战
    —读者来信综述
    我国各少数民族人民，一致反对美国侵略者发动细菌战的滔天罪行。本报先后接到少数民族读者的大批来信，表示扑灭美国细菌战的决心。
    中央民族学院学生会来信说：“我们不能容忍美国强盗的兽行。我们——中央民族学院三十三个民族的同学，决心加强抗美援朝宣传工作，努力学习，练好身体，随时响应祖国的号召，支援志愿军，打击美国侵略者。”北京回民学院全体师生员工来信说：“我们除了搞好学习，掌握科学技术，随时响应祖国的号召之外，我们还要尽一切力量，支援志愿军。我们要和全世界人民一道，把美国侵略者的血手斩断。”广西省龙胜县自治区各族各界人民代表会议全体代表及区农民代表来信说：“我们全自治区各族人民，向全国人民、向毛主席宣誓：我们保证搞好生产，完成一九五二年的生产任务，增强抗美援朝力量，为粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争。”云南省华宁县第二初级中学崔作雨来信说：“我们这个学校是一个少数民族学生占多数的学校。我们听到美国强盗撒布细菌的消息后，立即召开了控诉美帝国主义罪行的大会。我们一致拥护周恩来外交部长的声明，坚决反对美国侵略者进行细菌战。”甘肃省清水县王铭、马忠杰来信说：“我们清水县张家川的两万个回民青年，决心搞好今年的春耕生产，提高单位面积产量；积极参加变工互助组；帮助烈军属搞好春耕；开河引水，兴修小型水利，做好防旱抗旱工作；做好护林工作，每人保证栽活三棵树等实际行动，抗议美国强盗撒布细菌的罪行。”甘肃省临夏专区民族事务委员会来信说：“我们希望全国各兄弟民族进一步亲密团结，搞好生产，支援志愿军，以彻底歼灭美国侵略者。”东北机械第十厂全体职工
    以实际行动迎接“五一”节
    编辑同志：正当美帝国主义在朝鲜和东北大规模进行惨无人道的细菌战的时候，我们工人阶级的伟大节日——“五一”劳动节即将到来了。东北机械第十厂全体职工正用实际行动迎接“五一”节。各车间小组纷纷提出挑战、应战的条件，全厂已卷入了迎接“五一”的竞赛高潮。第三车间样板组保证提前五天完成四月份生产任务，质量达到百分之百，并在“五一”节前做出勾形卡尺十把，作为迎接“五一”节的献礼。第八车间保证降低废品率百分之三点五，并做好机器保养工作。第二车间和第五车间保证提前完成四月份生产任务，前者并保证把废品率降低百分之八十，做好培养新徒工工作。第一车间保证超过四月份生产任务百分之十五至二十，提高质量百分之三十。工人们保证实现这些计划，以巩固“三反”斗争的成果。　　　　赵宝琪东北被服局实验厂工人保证提前完成四月份生产任务
    编辑同志：我们工人在旧社会里，过着比牛马不如的生活，受尽了剥削和欺压。解放后三年来，党和毛主席领导着我们，教育着我们，培养着我们，使我们在各方面都提高了。在政治上，我们是领导阶级；在文化上，我们都能够参加文化学习，进各种学校念书；在生活上，我们的工资每年在提高，现在可以吃大米了。这种生动的例子很多。拿我们东北被服局实验厂来说，工友赵连城、武素艳等都参加了工厂管理委员会。工人刘喜华在政治学校学习完毕，现在厂里做领导工作。经过这次伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，我们更深刻地认识到党的伟大。我们全体职工现在都愉快地工作着，我们决心把运动搞到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。我们决心做好防疫工作，并提前两天完成四月份生产任务，作为给毛主席和“五一”节的献礼。

    提出挑战
    编辑同志：沈阳市东北机械管理局第一厂一车间工人，在“三反”运动中，生产情绪高涨，发起生产竞赛，提前完成了第一季生产任务。为以实际行动迎接“五一”劳动节，巩固“三反”的胜利成果。一车间职工拟出条件，向全厂其他车间及全市各厂、矿职工挑战：（一）保证作好防疫工作及车间环境卫生，场房内不留一点脏土、泡灰；（二）保证多装×台床子，超过原计划百分之十三。合理组织劳动力，不浪费人力，并做好五月生产准备工作；（三）保证提高产品质量百分之七十五，加强四防工作，不出任何事故；（四）积极参加“打虎”工作。
    东北机械管理局第一厂一车间全体职工前皖南日报社社长钱丹辉
    品质恶劣阻碍“三反”运动
    当地党委应迅速处理
    编辑同志：前皖南日报社社长钱丹辉假借“机关生产”之名，盗用公款，进行非法经营，并残酷地剥削职工；在“三反”期间，他不但不坦白交代自己的问题，反而对抗运动。
    钱丹辉经营商业的资金，一部分是剥削工人得来的。一九四九年八月至十一月，政府发给工人工资米，钱丹辉用改发代金、大秤进小秤出等办法，剥削工人，共得一千四百多万元；又从工人夜餐费、菜金及职工伙食积余费中，搜括一千七百多万元。另一部分资金是从事业经费中盗取的。屯溪“新华电讯”结余资金及皖南日报一九四九年三个月的报费和营业收入共九百多万元，都变成他作投机买卖的本钱。钱丹辉还公然指使总会计吕行真开假发票，造假单据，盗窃党委宣传经费，作为“机关生产”的收入。
    一九五零年二月，钱丹辉囤积了一批棉纱。为了逃避政府检查，他把纱藏在自己宿舍的阁楼上。向中国贸易公司买进价值七百二十万元的棉纱，一转手就赚了六百九十万元。一九五零年，上海遭敌机轰炸后，钱丹辉估计煤油会涨价，即派人去上海囤积煤油，并在芜湖市囤积煤油、米、面粉、布等物。
    钱丹辉的政治品质是极恶劣的。一九五零年，他从弋矶山养病回来。他的住屋附近，有一家商店，因初次开张营业，开放收音机。有不少市民围在那里听。他认为收音机扰乱了他的安静，就命令通讯员和报社承印所副所长前去制止。他甚至亲自端起卡宾枪，向群众开枪，造成很坏的影响。钱丹辉平时唯我独尊，听到别人对他有所批评和指责，他就用“无组织、无纪律”的帽子来压人。他遇见几个同志聚在一起闲谈，就认为：“这是小集团活动，有问题。”在编委会和社委会上，他动不动就拍桌子骂编委同志。他对于新参加工作的干部，不注意教育，常破口漫骂。
    “三反”运动开始后，他不检讨自己的错误，却采取种种手段，压制民主，阻碍“三反”运动。
    我们对于钱丹辉这种错误行为是不能容忍的。我们要求领导机关给钱丹辉以应有的处理。

    满洲里车站对联运货物不负责任
    有关部门应迅速予以处理
    编辑同志：自去年四月中苏铁路联运业务开办以来，大批建设器材源源自友邦苏联运到我国。这些器材在满洲里车站换装时，因该站人员不按章程办事，工作粗枝大叶，常常把联运货物弄得极端混乱。以到达我们天津车站的联运货物而言，就经常发生票面记载与实际不符、有货无票、有票无货、代号不符等错误。我们屡次打电报询问，该站竟置之不理，不设法纠正错误。加上天津铁路管理局负责处理联运事故的同志做事拖拉，致我站到现在为止，尚积存许多无法交付的进口货物。我们曾先后数十次把这些情况以口头、电话报告天津铁路管理局，并且用书面报告过四、五次，也反映到铁道部国际联运处，可是问题依然得不到解决。因此造成的损失殊属惊人：如去年十一月十二日到达的某项器材的保管费一项，迄今已达三亿一千多万元。这些有用的工业器材，本为许多工厂所急需，现在却被积压在我站，如果再不迅速处理，将会变成废料。难道上述这些单位无动于衷，不认为这是浪费吗？在伟大的“三反”斗争中，难道还允许这种不负责任的官僚主义作风吗？我们要求他们处理这些积压货物，并在报上解答迟迟不处理的理由。　　　康天新
