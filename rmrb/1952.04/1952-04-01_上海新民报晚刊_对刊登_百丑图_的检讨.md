    Shanghai Xinmin Evening News
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Publication of "Hundred Ugly Figures"

    Editor: The People's Daily's criticism of our newspaper's publication of "Hundred Ugly Figures" on February 23rd is correct, and we fully accept it.

    Our newspaper adopted the painting without prior review. The artist, Jiang Dongliang, sent it directly to the printing company after completing it. The editors of our newspaper assumed that Jiang Dongliang was a regular contributor and that there would be no errors, so they did not carefully review it before publication. After publication, the general editorial office discovered the error and immediately notified the chief editors that they must not distort subject matter or insult the working class. Subsequently, when the artist Jiang Dongliang submitted similar artwork, the general editorial office immediately pointed out the errors and asked him to redraw it.

    The occurrence of this major error shows that there is ideological麻痹 [má bì - numbness, apathy, carelessness] and a serious bourgeois style of running a newspaper in our work. The system of稿 [gǎo - manuscript, draft, version] submission and review is not strict. We only knew about seizing time, publishing early, and selling more copies of the newspaper. Therefore, we lost political vigilance and, during the "Three-Anti" struggle, allowed pictures defending the bourgeoisie to appear in the newspaper. This kind of mistake is intolerable.

    Our newspaper will certainly follow the opinions in the People's Daily's "Brief Review," raise vigilance, and not allow those pictures defending the bourgeoisie to occupy the newspaper's space. In addition to self-criticism by relevant personnel at all levels in our newspaper, we will also use this incident to educate all staff.

### 上海新民报晚刊  对刊登“百丑图”的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    上海新民报晚刊
    对刊登“百丑图”的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报对于我报在二月二十三日刊登的“百丑图”的批评是正确的，我们完全接受。
    我报采用该画，事先未予审核。该画作者江栋良于画好后，直接送制版公司制版。我报编辑同志以为江栋良是经常投稿者，不会发生什么错误，因此发刊前也未仔细复审。出版后，总编室才发觉错误，当即通知主编人员，不得歪曲题材，侮辱工人阶级。此后作者江栋良又送来类似画稿，总编室即指出其错误，令其重画。
    这一重大错误的发生，说明我们工作中存在着思想上的麻痹和严重的资产阶级办报作风。发稿、审稿制度不严格，只知道抢时间，早出版，多销几份报。因此，失去了政治警惕性，竟在“三反”斗争时，使代资产阶级辩护的图画出现在报纸上。这种错误是不能容忍的。
    我报一定依照人民日报“简评”中的意见，提高警惕，不让那些为资产阶级辩护的图画侵据报纸的篇幅。除我报各级有关人员进行检讨外，并以此事件教育全体工作人员。
