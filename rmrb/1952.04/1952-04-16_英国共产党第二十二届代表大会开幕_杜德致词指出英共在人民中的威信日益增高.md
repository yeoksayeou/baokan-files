Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th dispatch from TASS: The 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain opened on the 12th in Battersea Town Hall, South London. Dutt, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, pointed out in his opening speech that the prestige of the Communist Party is increasing among the British people. Dutt said: In order to raise the funds needed for the war preparations that the United States is forcing Britain to accept, the British government is launching a fierce attack on the people's living standards. Dutt continued: "All ordinary people, especially the working class, have never needed so urgently to stand up to defend the interests of the British people and participate in the struggle for peace as they do now." Dutt finally stated that the peace camp headed by the greatest genius of mankind, Stalin, is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the participants responded with stormy cheers. After the congress passed the report of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party, General Secretary Pollitt of the Communist Party made a political report. The congress then announced congratulatory messages from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, India, and other countries. After the congratulatory messages were read, all the representatives stood up and cheered enthusiastically.
