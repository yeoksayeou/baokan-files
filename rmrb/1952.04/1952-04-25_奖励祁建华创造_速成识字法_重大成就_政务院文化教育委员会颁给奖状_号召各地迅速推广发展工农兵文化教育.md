In order to reward this creation of great significance, the Government Administration Council's Committee on Culture and Education of the Central People's Government specially awarded an award certificate to Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Rapid Literacy Method," and a grand award ceremony was held on the afternoon of the 23rd. The ceremony was attended by: Guo Moruo, Director of the Government Administration Council's Committee on Culture and Education; Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Wei Que and Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government; Wu Yuzhang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writing Reform Research Committee; Liu Zhijian, Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; and Xu Teli, Liu Yazi, Tao Menghe, Hu Yuzhi, Ye Shengtao, Ai Siqi, Wu Han, Shu Sheyu, Luo Changpei, Li Jinxi, Cao Richang, Wu Yan Yin, and Ding Haochuan, members of the Government Administration Council's Committee on Culture and Education, heads of relevant agencies and organizations, and figures from the educational and scientific communities, totaling more than one hundred and twenty people. Director Guo Moruo, amidst warm applause from those present, presented the award certificate to Qi Jianhua.
    At the award ceremony, Guo Moruo, Lu Dingyi, Wei Que, Wu Yuzhang, Liu Zhijian, and others spoke successively. Qi Jianhua also delivered a speech of thanks. Director Guo said: The "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Qi Jianhua has made a great contribution to eliminating illiteracy and developing mass cultural education for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is one of the extremely valuable and important creations in cultural education work! Director Guo pointed out that Qi Jianhua's creation and success of the "Rapid Literacy Method" is a brilliant example of cultural and educational workers embodying Chairman Mao's spirit of seeking truth from facts. He called on cultural and educational workers to learn from Comrade Qi Jianhua's spirit and work selflessly for the development of the people's cultural and educational cause.
    Lu Dingyi said: The "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Qi Jianhua is an innovation in education work. It has opened a gateway for the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers to master cultural knowledge, and has a great effect on the rapid improvement of the cultural level of our people. All cultural and propaganda departments should adopt specific measures to promote the "Rapid Literacy Method" in the implementation of the Government Administration Council's instruction of June 1, 1950, on eliminating worker illiteracy, in winter schools, in worker-peasant rapid primary schools, vocational spare-time schools, and farmer spare-time schools.
    Wei Que said: The effectiveness of the "Rapid Literacy Method" is certain. The Central Ministry of Education is further studying to promote this method.
    Wu Yuzhang called on writing reform workers to overcome shortcomings in research methods and learn from Qi Jianhua's creative spirit.
    Liu Zhijian said: The Cultural and Education Committee's awarding of a certificate to Qi Jianhua this time is not only an honor for Qi Jianhua himself, but also an honor for the cultural and educational workers and all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This will play a great role in encouraging and promoting the current task of the troops to eliminate illiteracy, improve culture, and strive to build a modernized national defense force.
    Qi Jianhua finally delivered a speech of thanks, saying: The success of the "Rapid Literacy Method" should first be attributed to the leadership of the Party and superiors. The reason why the "Rapid Literacy Method" was first successful in the army is not only related to the method itself, but the most important reason is that the soldiers have a high degree of political consciousness and a spirit of hard study and research. He expressed that he must learn more humbly, strive for progress, and live up to everyone's encouragement and expectations. (Attached picture)

    政务院文化教育委员会颁给奖状
    号召各地迅速推广发展工农兵文化教育
    【新华社二十四日讯】人民解放军某部文化教员祁建华所创造的“速成识字法”，在战士、工人、农民文盲中推行以来，已获显著成效。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会为了奖励这个有重大意义的创造，特给“速成识字法”的创造人祁建华颁发奖状，并于二十三日下午隆重举行给奖典礼。参加这次典礼的有：政务院文化教育委员会主任郭沫若，中共中央宣传部部长陆定一，中央人民政府教育部副部长韦悫、曾昭抡，中国文字改革研究委员会副主任委员吴玉章，人民革命军事委员会总政治部宣传部部长刘志坚，以及政务院文化教育委员会委员、各有关机关团体负责人、教育界科学界人士徐特立、柳亚子、陶孟和、胡愈之、叶圣陶、艾思奇、吴晗、舒舍予、罗常培、黎锦熙、曹日昌、吴研因、丁浩川等一百二十多人。郭沫若主任在到会者的热烈掌声中，将奖状授给了祁建华。
    在给奖典礼大会上，郭沫若、陆定一、韦悫、吴玉章、刘志坚等相继讲了话。祁建华也致词答谢。郭主任说：祁建华创造的“速成识字法”，对于扫除文盲、发展工农兵群众文化教育的贡献很大，是文化教育工作上极有价值的极应重视的创造之一！郭主任指出祁建华“速成识字法”的创造与成功是文化教育工作者体现毛主席实事求是精神的光辉典型。他号召文化教育工作者应该学习祁建华同志这种精神，为发展人民文化教育事业而忘我地工作。
    陆定一说：祁建华创造的“速成识字法”是教育工作中的一个革新，它已为广大工农兵劳动人民掌握文化知识这件事打开了一道关口，对我国人民文化水平的迅速提高有很大作用。各文教宣传部门应在实行政务院一九五○年六月一日关于扫除工人文盲的指示中，在冬学中，在工农速成初等学校、职工业余学校、农民业余学校中，采取具体办法来推行“速成识字法”。
    韦悫说：“速成识字法”的成效是肯定的。中央教育部正在进一步研究以推广这种方法。
    吴玉章号召文字改革工作者克服研究方法上的缺点，向祁建华的创造精神学习。
    刘志坚说：文化教育委员会这次颁给祁建华奖状，不仅是祁建华本人的光荣，也是中国人民解放军的文教工作者和全体同志的光荣。这对当前部队扫除文盲、提高文化，为建设现代化国防军而奋斗的任务来说，将会起极大的鼓励和推动作用。
    祁建华最后致答辞说：“速成识字法”之所以能得到成功，首先应归功于党和上级的领导。“速成识字法”之所以能在部队中首先获得成功，不单纯是与方法本身有关，最主要原因是战士们具有高度的政治觉悟和苦学钻研的精神。他表示：一定要更虚心地学习，力求前进，不辜负大家对他的鼓励和希望。（附图片）
