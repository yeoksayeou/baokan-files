The Beijing Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration boldly promoted activists who emerged during the "Three-Anti" Movement to leadership positions at all levels. These activists, newly appointed as foremen, leading workers, dispatchers, directors, section chiefs, station masters, section chiefs, and factory directors, numbered more than 120, of whom 80 percent were worker-cadres. They all led their respective areas of work very well, shattering the erroneous ideas of some people who doubted that worker-cadres lacked technical knowledge, had low levels of education, and could not do leadership work well. The Baoding Engineering Section promoted a group of worker-activists, replacing a leading worker and eleven foremen who were suspended or dismissed due to corruption issues, filling two vacancies for leading workers and one for a foreman due to retirement, and filling other six foreman positions. After these worker-activists, lacking "experience" but possessing both virtue and talent, were promoted to leadership positions, a new atmosphere emerged in their work, and the work efficiency of each work area greatly improved. After the Zhengding Work Area boldly promoted track maintenance foreman Yu Encheng to leading worker, he summarized his work every day, held a review meeting to discuss advantages and disadvantages on the same day after returning to the work area, and implemented a five-level scoring system to reward production, resulting in exceptionally good results in the line vibration test in March. The work rate averaged 7 meters per person per day, exceeding the standard by 2 meters. Yu Encheng also helped the Liuxinzhuang Work Area, enabling it to win the red flag in the March circular competition. After the Beihedian Work Area promoted Liu Zhongyi, a young track maintenance worker who was good at publicity and mobilization, to foreman, it changed the situation where it used to take until 7:00 PM to barely reach the standard quantity of 5 meters per day. Now, it exceeds 5 meters by 3:30 PM every day. This fact shattered the extremely harmful purely technical viewpoint that once existed among the leaders of the section, namely, "Worker-cadres have no technology and cannot be leaders!" and "As long as you have technology, don't consider politics; it's enough to be able to work!"

Boldly promoting the most outstanding worker-activists to leadership positions through bypassing levels is a notable feature of this round of bold cadre promotions by the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau. However, the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau encountered ideological resistance from the leaders of some units when implementing this correct policy. For example, when the sub-bureau promoted Xia Songlin, a leading worker from the Beijing Engineering Section, to deputy section chief and line director of the section, the section's leaders and the sub-bureau's engineering section chief disagreed, believing that only technical personnel could be competent for the job. Technical personnel were also talking about it: "In engineering, the promotion of workers to leading workers is the limit," and "The line director must be a technical person." Not long after Xia Songlin was promoted to line director, an emergency task of replacing heavy rails occurred in the Dongbianmen area. The time for closing the route was short, but the number of rails to be replaced within this short period was large. The section chief personally inspected the site and worried that the task could not be completed, but Xia Songlin, who had rich on-site experience, assured the section chief that it could be completed. Xia Songlin organized all the workers at the site and appropriately divided the work, completing the entire task seven or eight minutes ahead of schedule. After seeing this unexpected achievement, the section chief, who was an engineer, realized that the personnel department's cadre policy was correct. He told everyone, "We promoted the right cadre in our section. Old Xia is indeed a good line director. People with technical theory must combine it with on-site experience!" He enthusiastically learned on-site experience from Xia Songlin while teaching Xia Songlin technical theory.

Being good at relying on the masses and following the mass line to promote cadres is one of the reasons why the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau was able to select outstanding leaders this time. The 121 cadres promoted by the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau this time were all people who had been tested in struggle, had close ties with the masses, and had prestige among the masses. Therefore, after they were promoted to leadership positions at all levels, they quickly established a regular system for leaders to contact the masses. After Fengtai Station promoted Guan Qi, a freight shift leader who was supported by the masses, to freight director, he humbly learned from the masses about internal car allocation and other businesses that he was not familiar with and established a good method of contacting the masses – a work review meeting system, which solved the problem of disunity between loaders and weighers that had existed in the past. He also established many work systems such as on-card loading and call-and-response system. In this way, Guan Qi led and united the staff of the entire freight office, promoting everyone's enthusiasm and greatly shortening the station's loading and unloading time. In January, the average loading and unloading time per car at the station was 51 minutes. Since Guan Qi was promoted to freight director, it has been shortened to 47 minutes in March. The loading capacity of whole and less-than-carload freight has increased from 24.8 tons per car in January to 26.5 tons in March.

The reason why the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau was able to massively promote activists with both virtue and talent and close ties with the masses to leadership positions this time is that the sub-bureau, during the "Three-Anti" Movement, promptly formed a special group with the personnel department as the center and including the heads of the trade union, the Youth League, and other units, to conduct selection and training work in a planned and bold manner. The units under the sub-bureau also established such special groups, going deep into the movement to understand worker-activists with both virtue and talent who were supported by the masses and helping them. The special group of the Nankou Locomotive Depot discovered 57 activists with firm stances and responsible work during the "Three-Anti" Movement and then selected 16 of these 57 activists who had the best ties with the masses and were most supported by the masses as training targets. Fifteen of these sixteen people were workers, and one was a staff member. Xi Yuchun, who started as a car cleaner, was promoted to deputy operations director and often solicited opinions from the masses to improve his work. He not only competently completed his work but also greatly improved his business. He and Gao Yufeng, who was newly promoted from a driving instructor to deputy operations director, united the masses, ensuring that no accidents occurred with locomotives in the section.

By April 10, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau had boldly promoted 348 people who came out during the "Three-Anti" Movement to serve as leaders at all levels, such as section chiefs, section directors, division chiefs, directors, stationmasters, leading workers, and foremen, of whom worker-cadres accounted for 70 percent. These activists who emerged from the masses overcame the difficulties they encountered in their new positions through various methods and quickly became familiar with their businesses in a short period of time.

Being good at learning and studying diligently is a notable characteristic of newly promoted worker-cadres. Wang Wenhua, an economic planner and "tiger fighter" from the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, was promoted to materials director of the depot. He humbly learned various rules and regulations from people familiar with materials, asking questions whenever he didn't understand. He listened carefully when the materials division staff reported their work to him, familiarizing himself with all the specific situations in the materials work. Through diligent study, he improved many work systems. To prevent material loss and prevent fraud in material requisition, he established a circulating register for material receipt and delivery and a material borrowing and lending registration system. To prevent tearing up accounts and forging documents, he established a close liaison system between the material, finance, and statistics divisions. To supply materials needed for production in a timely manner, he set up material requisition boxes. In addition, he has completely mastered the laws of material consumption in the production department, such as the amount of materials used during the locomotive scheduled inspection period and which materials are used more and which are used less. Based on these specific situations, he increased or decreased the amount of materials in stock, completely eliminating the previous phenomenon of not being able to supply commonly used materials and having a lot of stagnant materials, and saved a lot of working capital. Wang Wenhua has been called "a very good materials director" by the depot's leaders and workers.

Relying on the worker masses and concentrating everyone's wisdom is also a major method for new cadres to overcome difficulties and improve work. An Jingtian, the newly promoted factory director of the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, is an example of being good at relying on the masses. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, one-tenth of the factory's personnel participated in the "tiger fighting" team, but the locomotive overhaul task had to be completed. Under this situation, An Jingtian listened widely to the workers' opinions and collected methods to improve work efficiency and improve work. In the past, the factory had many temporary repair jobs for overhauled locomotives, reaching 14 in January, which not only disrupted the locomotive overhaul work plan but also affected the locomotive operation efficiency. An Jingtian convened a research conference and studied the reasons for the large number of temporary repair jobs with the overhaul workers. As a result, they found that the inspectors, acceptors, and thermal engineers had inconsistent opinions when overhauling locomotives, and all three of them arbitrarily directed the workers, so problems often occurred. An Jingtian addressed this shortcoming at a joint meeting of employees from the operations, factory, and technical departments of the depot and suggested establishing a method of joint research by relevant personnel when overhauling locomotives, with the overhaul team carrying out the work after the opinions were unified. After this method was implemented, there were no temporary repair jobs at all in March. An Jingtian used this method of following the mass line to improve work efficiency and work quality. The steam release work when overhauling locomotives previously took two hours, but now it only takes 30 minutes. The locomotive drain valve used to leak after running 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers, but now it can run 10,000 kilometers. The ignition time for large locomotives previously took 1 hour and 50 minutes, but now it only takes 42 minutes. In particular, the locomotive steam chamber leakage time (the longer the better) previously did not meet the standard (75 seconds), but now it has exceeded the standard, reaching a maximum of 149 seconds. Due to these huge improvements, the locomotive washing and inspection time at the depot has been shortened from 12 hours before the "Three-Anti" Movement to 8 hours, and the washing and inspection mileage has been extended from 6,000 kilometers to 8,000 kilometers. Due to the significant improvement in work efficiency, the factory's production not only was not affected during the "Three-Anti" Movement but also overfulfilled the task.

Newly promoted cadres can set an example, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and unite the masses, thereby breaking down the barriers in some departments and rapidly improving work efficiency. For example, the freight department and the operations department of Tianjin North Station often had disagreements on shunting, marshaling, and station stop times due to departmentalism and competition for achievements. Since the station promoted Yang Shuen, a freight shift leader, to freight director, Yang Shuen took the initiative to establish contact with Wu Huanchang, the deputy operations director of the station, review the shortcomings of the freight department, and promptly educate other employees of the freight department, completely changing the relationship between them. As a result, the freight department of the station completed 143.9 percent of its task in March, and the operations department also overfulfilled its task. (Xinhua News Agency)

During the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau boldly promoted 176 people to become administrative leaders at all levels of production units, of whom 63 percent were directly promoted from among the workers. This important measure has become a major link in consolidating the achievements of the "Three-Anti" from an organizational perspective. It not only promptly made up for the cadre vacancies in the operations, transportation, engineering, telecommunications, and rolling stock production units that collapsed during the "Three-Anti" Movement and existed before the "Three-Anti" Movement but also further brought into play the leading role of the working class in the railway system.

Those promoted this time are all models in production and model combatants in the "Three-Anti" Movement. They are most familiar with the working class's thinking and understand their needs, so they can intimately care for the workers' lives, solve their production difficulties, and rely on the workers to improve production and improve technology. For example, Li Jinquan, the newly promoted deputy factory director of the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot, often goes deep into the site and brainstorms with the workers. In the past, there were many temporary repair accidents during locomotive overhauls, so he was determined to find out the reasons. After more than ten days of research on the site, he found that in the past, whether repairing, using, or washing and inspecting locomotives, they all made the mistake of "tightening first and loosening later," which not only tired people but also resulted in rough work. They seized this point and took the initiative to find the foremen and group leaders, held three meetings, and studied with the workers to concentrate the workers' wisdom and strengthen planning, finally solving this problem. The average time for washing and inspecting locomotives in March has dropped from 14 to 12 hours. The workers said, "Working like this is fast, people aren't busy, and the work is good."

The most notable characteristic of the worker-cadres promoted by the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau is their willingness to learn and not to bow to difficulties. This is fully demonstrated in every newly promoted cadre, which has brought about a vigorous new atmosphere in production in the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau. Some people doubted that worker-cadres lacked technology and might not be competent. But these doubts were shattered in the face of iron facts. The exemplary deeds of Li Kuanren, the newly promoted deputy section chief of the locomotive depot, are an example. Class A inspection vehicles need to use brake cylinder leather pads. The materials division sent people to the materials factory and railway factory to find them, but they could not find this material. It looked like the task was going to be suspended again due to waiting for materials. At this time, some leaders showed nervousness, but Li Kuanren, at this critical juncture, mobilized the masses and once again turned over the waste pile, finding five brake cylinder leather pads. After repairing these brake cylinder leather pads, three of them could be used, and the difficulty was overcome. After being promoted to deputy section chief, Li Kuanren took charge of the overall administrative work of the entire section. For him, the most difficult thing was to master finance and materials. He thought, "We workers can't do numbers. We can only unite intellectuals and learn from them." He often convened relevant materials and financial personnel to hold discussions and studies. He encouraged the work confidence of the materials and financial staff and then assigned trainees to help with the work, so that the material budget, financial plan, and statistical reports that had not been completed for three months were completed ahead of schedule in the first half of April.

This group of newly promoted cadres has a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause and has brought into play their initiative and creativity in completing production tasks, opening up a new situation in production. After Dai Shuangxi, a leading worker from the Linfen Engineering Section, was promoted to deputy road maintenance director, he was responsible for bridge engineering work. He rectified the work that had been messed up by corrupt elements in the past, re-formulated the bridge maintenance plan, established a foreman inspection system, a work liaison system between the bridge work area and the road maintenance work area, and a liaison system between the bridge work area and the station. The masses also spontaneously established a division of labor and responsibility system to check each other's work, and the entire bridge engineering work changed its face. Although the bridge maintenance plan for April could not be carried out for three or four days due to rain, the workers unanimously guaranteed to complete it on schedule.

After the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau boldly promoted Li Dazhi, a "Three-Anti" model combatant, to deputy director of the construction section, he led the production work to move forward continuously. At that time, more than 300 project final accounts from the previous year and this year's maintenance, major repairs, basic construction project plans, and budgets all needed to be completed within a limited time. However, the "tiger fighting" team was still "fighting tigers" at this time, and some technical personnel still had the idea of not daring to take responsibility boldly. Comrade Li Dazhi continued to carry forward his working style of being loyal to the revolution, hardworking, and simple. First, he cleared everyone's thinking and reorganized the labor force according to actual work needs. He divided the three rooms into seven groups, flexibly deployed forces, boldly relied on the masses, so that clerical staff did more copying work, and technical staff did as much design, drafting, and budget preparation work as possible, giving full play to everyone's expertise. In this way, everyone had a common struggle goal and knew what to do, so that the leadership's intentions and the enthusiasm of the masses were closely combined, making up for the difficulty of insufficient personnel. More importantly, unnecessary items in the original final accounts were removed, and the formalism that had been devoted to the design of wood grain and brick seams in the past was corrected. Finally, more than 30 people used 18 days to complete 348 project final accounts that more than 50 people had not completed last year. Other major repairs, basic construction, maintenance, and other project budgets were also completed on schedule, creating favorable conditions for completing the task in 1952.

In the production units of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, wherever the cadre promotion work was done well, the production indicators were significantly improved, and the workers' production enthusiasm was even higher. This is closely inseparable from the sub-bureau's leadership's emphasis on cadre training and the correct implementation of the cadre policy. Before the start of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the sub-bureau held two meetings specifically to study cadre work, criticizing the purely "experience" and "technical" views of some leaders, and also decided to implement a preparatory training system. For example, the current cadres consciously discovered and trained a deputy cadre. Because preparatory work was done in advance and the policy of combining bold promotion with strict requirements was clarified, a solid foundation was laid for the current cadre promotion. At the same time, the leadership also paid timely attention to and cared about the specific difficulties of the new cadres in their work positions. For example, after Li Yingxin, a worker from the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot, was promoted to deputy director of the materials office, some old intellectuals had bad ideas of despising workers and raised more than ten kinds of difficulties at the meeting to deliberately make things difficult for him. After discovering this situation, the leadership promptly criticized this backward and decadent ideology and encouraged these intellectuals to closely unite the masses and humbly learn from the masses. As a result, they improved their work. There were two vicious accidents in March, but no vicious accidents occurred from April 1 to 19. Even general liability accidents did not occur.

    提拔了干部打开了局面
    ——北京、天津、太原三个铁路分局提拔积极分子做领导工作后生产上和管理上的新气象
    天津铁路管理局北京分局大胆放手提拔在“三反”运动中涌现出来的积极分子担任各级领导工作。这些新担任工长、领工员、运转员、主任、股长、站长、段长、厂长的积极分子，共有一百二十多人，其中百分之八十是工人干部。他们都把业务领导得很好，粉碎了一些人怀疑工人干部不懂技术，文化水平不高，做不好领导工作的错误思想。保定工务段提拔的一批工人积极分子，代替了因贪污问题停职、撤职的一个领工员和十一个工长的职务，补充了两个因年老退休的领工员和一个工长的空额和其他六名工长的缺额。这些没有“资历”但德才俱备的工人积极分子被提拔到领导岗位上后，工作中呈现出一片新气象，各工区工作效率大大提高。正定工区大胆提拔养路工长于恩成为领工员后，他每日都对工作作一总结，回工区后当天开优缺点的检讨会，实行奖励生产的五级计分制，使该工区三月份的线路震动试验的效果异常良好，工率平均每人每日达七公尺，超过标准两公尺。于恩成并帮助柳辛庄工区，使该工区获得三月份的循环竞赛红旗。北河店工区提拔善于宣传鼓动的青年养路工刘中义当工长后，改变了过去每天要工作到晚间七点多钟才能勉强达到五公尺的标准量的情况，现在每天作到下午三点半钟即超过五公尺了。这个事实打破了该段领导方面曾一度存在过的“工人干部没有技术，做领导干部做不了！”“只要有技术，政治不考虑，能干活就成了！”的极端有害的单纯技术观点。
    大胆地越级提拔最优秀的工人积极分子到领导岗位上来，是北京铁路分局这次放手提拔干部中的一个显著特点。但北京铁路分局在执行这一正确方针时，曾遇到一部分单位领导人思想上的抵抗。如分局把北京工务段领工员夏松林越级提升为该段副段长兼线路主任时，段的领导人和分局的工务科长都不同意，他们认为只有提拔技术人员才能胜任。技术人员们也在纷纷谈论：“工务上，工人提拔到领工员到顶了”，“线路主任要有技术的人当的”。夏松林被提拔为线路主任不久，东便门地区发生了一件紧急换重轨的任务，封闭路线的时间很短，在这个短促时间内要完成的换轨的数量却很大。该段段长亲到现场考察后担忧完不成任务，但现场经验丰富的夏松林却向段长保证能完成。夏松林把到工地的所有工人组织起来，适当分工，结果提前七八分钟作完了全部工作。工程师出身的段长看到这个意外成绩后，才认识到人事部门执行的干部政策是正确的，他到处和人说：“咱们段上提拔干部提对了，老夏果真是一个好线路主任，有技术理论的人必需要和现场的经验结合呀！”他热心地跟夏松林学现场经验，同时教夏松林技术理论。
    善于依靠群众，走群众路线提拔干部，是这次北京铁路分局能够选拔到优秀的领导干部的原因之一。北京铁路分局这次提拔的一百二十一个干部，都是经过斗争考验、和群众有密切联系、在群众中有威信的人。因此他们一被提拔到各级领导岗位上来后，很快便制订了领导和群众联系的经常制度。丰台车站提拔了为群众拥护的货运领班管起担任货运主任后，他即虚心向群众学习自己所不熟悉的内部配车等业务，并建立了和群众联系的好方法——工作检讨会制度，解决了过去该站装卸工和司磅员之间不团结的问题。他又建立了对牌装车、呼唤应答制等许多工作制度。这样，管起便领导和团结了全货运室的职工，发扬了大家的积极性，使该站装卸车时间大大缩短。该站一月份每车装卸时间平均五十一分钟，自管起被提拔为货运主任后，三月份即已缩短到四十七分。整、零车装载量已由一月份的每车装二十四点八吨提高到三月份的二十六点五吨。
    北京铁路分局这次所以能大量地提拔德才兼备的、和群众有密切联系的积极分子到领导岗位上来，是由于分局在“三反”运动中及时以人事部门为中心，并吸收工会、青年团等单位负责人组成专门的小组，有计划大胆放手地进行选拔培养工作。分局所属各单位也同样成立了这样的专门小组，深入运动中去了解为群众所拥护的德才兼备的工人积极分子，并对他们进行帮助。南口机务段的专门小组，曾在“三反”运动中发现五十七个立场坚定、工作负责的积极分子，再从这五十七个积极分子中选择和群众联系最好、为群众所最拥护的十六个人作为培养对象。这十六个人中有十五个是工人，一个是职员。擦车工出身的席玉春被提拔为运转正主任后，经常征求群众意见改进工作。他不但胜任工作，还大大提高了业务。他和新从指导司机提升为运转副主任的高玉峰团结了群众，使该段机车没有出过一次事故。（新华社）

    天津铁路分局截至四月十日为止，在“三反”运动中已大胆地提拔了三百四十八人担任科长、段长、股长、主任、站长、领工员、工长等各级领导工作，其中工人干部占百分之七十。这些从群众中涌现出来的积极分子，用各种方法克服了在新工作岗位上碰到的困难，在很短期间就熟悉了业务。
    善于学习，虚心钻研，是新提拔起来的工人干部的显著特点。天津机务段经济计划员、“打虎”积极分子王文华，被提拔为该段材料主任后，虚心向熟悉材料的人学习各种规章、制度，不懂就问；材料股人员向他汇报工作时，他细心听，从中熟悉材料工作中的一切具体情况。经过钻研，他改进了许多工作制度。为了防止材料丢失，防止领取材料中的舞弊行为，他建立了领收材料巡回簿、借出借入材料登记制度；为了防止撕毁账目，假造单据，建立了材料、财务、统计各股之间的密切联系制度；为了及时供应生产需要的材料，设立了领料箱。此外，他并已彻底掌握住了生产部门用料的规律，如机车定检时期，用料数量，那些材料用得多，那些用得少等情况，根据这些具体情况，他增减库内存料，完全消灭了以前那种常用料供应不上，呆料很多的现象，并节省了大量流动资金。王文华已被该段领导干部和工人们称为“很漂亮的材料主任了”。
    依靠工人群众，集中大家的智慧，也是新干部克服困难，改进工作的主要方法之一。天津机务段新提拔起来的工厂主任安景田，便是善于依靠群众的榜样。该段工厂在“三反”运动中有十分之一的人员参加了“打虎”队，但是机车检修任务必须完成。在这种情况下面，安景田广泛听取工人意见，收集提高工作效率、改进工作的办法。该厂过去检修机车的临时修理活很多，今年一月份达到十四件，不仅扰乱机车检修工作计划，并且影响机车运用效率。安景田召开研究会，和检修工人一起研究临时修理活多的原因。结果找出是因为在检修机车时，检查员、验收员、热力员意见不统一，他们三个人都随便指挥工人，所以常出毛病。安景田就针对这个缺点在该段召开的运转、工厂、技术三部门职工联席会议上，建议建立检修机车时各有关人员共同研究，意见统一之后，再由包修组进行工作的办法。这个办法实行后，三月份已经完全没有临时修理活。安景田用这种走群众路线的方法，提高了工作效率和工作质量。该段检修机车时的放汽工作以前须两小时，现在只须三十分钟；机车放水阀以前跑四五千公里就漏，现在可以跑一万公里；大型机车点火时间以前须一点五十分钟，现在只用四十二分钟；尤其是机车汽室漏泄时间（时间愈长愈好）过去达不到标准（七十五秒），现在都已超过标准，最高达一百四十九秒。由于这些巨大的改进，该段机车洗检时间已由“三反”运动前的十二小时缩短到八小时，洗检公里已由过去的六千公里延长到八千公里。由于工作效率显著提高，该段工厂在“三反”运动中生产不仅没有受到影响，并且超额完成了任务。
    新提拔起来的干部能够以身作则，开展批评和自我批评，团结群众，因而打破了个别部门工作中间的隔阂，使工作效率迅速提高。如天津北站货运部门和运转部门，由于本位主义，抢成绩，经常在调车编车和停站时间等问题上闹意见。自从该站把货运领班杨树恩提拔为货运主任以后，杨树恩便主动和该站运转副主任吴焕昌建立联系，检讨货运部门的缺点，并及时教育了货运部门其他职工，完全改变了相互间的关系。因此该站三月份货运部门完成任务百分之一百四十三点九，运转部门也超额完成了任务。（新华社）

    太原铁路分局在“三反”运动中，大胆放手提拔了一百七十六个人成为生产单位各级的行政领导干部，其中百分之六十三是由工人当中直接提拔起来的。这个重要措施已成为目前从组织上巩固“三反”成果的主要环节；不但及时弥补了“三反”中垮了的和“三反”前机务、运输、工务、电务，车辆生产上一般的干部缺额，而且进一步发挥了铁路系统中的工人阶级的领导作用。
    这次被提拔的都是生产上的模范和“三反”运动中的模范战斗员。他们最熟悉工人阶级的思想情况，和了解他们的需要，因此也就能够亲切地关怀工人的生活，解决他们生产上的困难，依靠工人来提高生产，改进技术。如太原北站机务段新提升的工厂副主任李金全，他经常深入现场，跟工人在一起想办法。过去机车检修的临修事故多，他便下决心要把原因找出来，经过他在现场十几天的钻研，发现已往不论修用，或洗检车，都犯了“先紧后松”的毛病，这样不但人受累，出的活也粗糙。他们抓住了这一点，就主动地找到工长、组长，开了三次会议，又和工友们一块研究，集中工友们的智慧，加强了计划性，终于解决了这个问题。洗检车平均时间三月份已经由十四点降到十二点。工友们都说：“这样干，又快，人不忙，活还好。”
    太原铁路分局提拔的工人干部，最显著的特点是虚心学习，不向困难低头。从每个新提拔的干部身上，都充分地表现了这一点，因而使太原铁路分局在生产上出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。有些人曾怀疑，工人干部没有技术，恐怕不能胜任。但这些怀疑在铁的事实面前被粉碎了。机务段新提拔的副段长李宽仁的模范事迹就是一个例子。甲检车需要用制动筒皮垫，材料股派人去材料厂、铁路工厂去找，都找不见这种材料，眼看任务又要停工待料了。这时有些领导干部表现出形色紧张，但李宽仁在这紧要关头，发动群众，又一次翻开废料堆，翻出五个制动筒皮垫。这些制动筒皮垫经修理有三个能用，困难克服了。李宽仁被提升副段长后，就担当全段的行政全盘工作，对他说来，最感困难的是掌握财务、材料。他想：“咱们当工人的对数字是干不了，只有团结知识分子，向他们学习。”他经常召集有关材料、财务人员座谈研究。他鼓舞材料、财务工作人员的工作信心，随后又配备练习生帮助工作，使三个月没完成的材料预算、财务计划、统计表报，在四月份上半月就提前完成了。
    这批新提拔的干部，对革命事业有很高的责任心，在完成生产任务上发挥了他们的积极性和创造能力，打开了生产上的新局面。临汾工务段领工员戴双喜被提拔为养路副主任后，负责桥梁工程工作。他整顿了过去被贪污分子搞得一团糟的工作，重新制定了桥梁维修计划，建立工长检查制度，桥梁工区和养路工区的工作联系制度，桥梁工区和车站的联系制度；群众也自动地建立分工负责制度，互相检查工作，整个的桥梁工程工作改变了面貌。四月份的桥梁维修计划，虽因落雨三、四天不能工作，但工友们一致保证按期完成。
    太原铁路分局大胆地提拔了“三反”模范战斗员李大志为建筑段副段长后，他领导着生产工作不断前进。当时有上年的三百多件工程决算和今年的维修、大修，基本建设工程计划、预算，都急需限期完成。但这时“打虎”队还在“打虎”，有些技术人员还有着不敢大胆负责的思想。李大志同志继续发扬了他忠实于革命的坚苦朴素的工作作风，首先打通了大家的思想，根据实际工作需要，重新组织劳动力。他把三个室分成七个组，机动调配力量，大胆地依靠群众，事务人员就多做抄写工作，技术人员就尽量去做设计，制图和编造预算等技术工作，充分发挥了每个人的专长。这样大家有了共同奋斗的目标，心中有数，使领导的意图和群众的热情紧紧地结合起来，弥补了人员不足的困难。更主要的是：把原来决算中不必要的项目取掉了，以及纠正了过去专在木纹、砖缝等设计上用工夫的形式主义作风。终于，三十多人用了十八天的时间完成了去年五十多人还完不成的三百四十八件工程决算。其他大修、基本建设、维修等各种工程预算也都按期完成了，为完成一九五二年的任务创造了有利的条件。
    太原铁路分局各生产单位，那里提拔干部工作作得好，那里的生产指标就有显著的提高，工人们的生产热情也更加高涨。这和分局领导的重视培养干部和正确执行了干部政策，是密切不可分的。“三反”运动开始以前，分局就先后召开了两次专门研究干部工作的会议，批判某些领导干部的单纯“资历”、“技术”观点，并且也决定了实行预备培养制度。如现职干部就有意识地发现和培养一名副职干部。因为事先就做了准备工作，明确了大胆提拔和严格要求相结合的方针，就给现在的提拔干部打下了稳固的基础，同时领导方面也及时注意和关心着新干部在工作岗位上的具体困难。如太原北站机务段工人李英新被提拔为材料室副主任，有些旧知识分子有着轻视工人的坏思想，在会议上提出十多种困难，故意刁难他。领导方面发觉这种情况后，及时批判了这种落后的腐朽思想；同时并鼓励这些知识分子密切团结群众，虚心向群众学习。结果，他们改进了工作。三月份出了两件恶性事故；四月份截至十九日止没有发生恶性事故，就是一般的责任事故，一次也没有发生。
