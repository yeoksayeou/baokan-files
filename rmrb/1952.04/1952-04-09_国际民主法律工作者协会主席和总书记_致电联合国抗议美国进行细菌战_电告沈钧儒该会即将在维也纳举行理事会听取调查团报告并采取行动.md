Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Pritt, and the Secretary-General, Nordmann, telegraphed the Secretary-General of the United Nations on March 24, strongly protesting the heinous crime of the United States in carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, and requesting the United Nations Security Council to take all steps to oppose such crimes, condemn the criminals, and stop their intervention in the Korean War. The telegram reads as follows:

Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations:

Mr. Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of China and Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, has informed the International Association of Democratic Lawyers of the fact that General Ridgway's troops in Korea are using bacteriological weapons.

President Shen Junru also reported that American military aircraft violated the airspace of the People's Republic of China and scattered insects carrying bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang and other places.

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers lodges a serious protest against this heinous war method, which is prohibited by international law and especially by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925.

This war method, prohibited by international law, is intolerable to the conscience of the people of the world.

In view of the fact that this war method is a threat to all mankind, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers therefore requests the United Nations Security Council to take all steps within its power to oppose such crimes, condemn these criminals and stop their intervention in the Korean War.

Mr. Secretary-General, please accept our highest regards.

		President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Pritt
		Secretary-General Nordmann

I have immediately forwarded it to all branches of the Association, asking them to respond to your earnest call and quickly protest against bacteriological warfare.
