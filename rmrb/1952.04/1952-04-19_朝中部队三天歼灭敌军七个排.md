Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 18th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continued to repel enemy incursions on the front lines during the three days from April 11th to 13th, and annihilated seven enemy platoons in small-scale counterattacks.

　　At 10:00 PM on April 11th, an enemy company invaded Height 890.2 west of Wendengli, and was heroically repelled by our defending troops after five consecutive assaults, with the enemy suffering more than 30 casualties. At 10:20 PM on the same day, an assault team from one of our units launched a fierce attack on three high grounds within 4 to 10 kilometers west of Wendengli. After 40 minutes of fierce fighting, they annihilated five platoons of the defending enemy, the Rhee's puppet army, killing and wounding more than 180 enemy soldiers. At 1:00 AM on the 12th, a reconnaissance team from our army skillfully crossed the enemy's heavy barbed wire and passed through the minefield in the dark night, suddenly rushed to Height 811.7, about 20 kilometers northeast of Wendengli, and annihilated more than 20 Rhee's puppet troops on the hilltop in one fell swoop. On the night of the 13th, one of our units again attacked the enemy on Height 949.2 and Height 870 east of the North Han River, completely annihilating two platoons of the defending enemy, the Rhee's puppet army, killing and wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers.

    朝中部队三天歼灭敌军七个排
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在四月十一日至十三日的三天中，继续在前线打退敌军的窜犯，并在小型反击战中歼灭敌军七个排。
    四月十一日夜十时，敌军一个连进犯文登里以西八九零点二高地，连续五次冲锋都被我守军英勇击退，敌军伤亡三十多名。同日夜十时二十分，我军某部袭击队在猛袭文登里以西四至十公里以内的三个高地，经四十分钟的激战，将守敌李伪军五个排歼灭，毙伤敌军一百八十多名。十二日一时，我军一支侦察队，在漆黑的夜里巧妙地穿过敌军重重的铁丝网，越过设雷区，突然冲上了文登里东北约二十公里的八一一点七高地，将山头上的李伪军二十多人一举歼灭。十三日夜，我军某部又袭击北汉江以东九四九点二高地及八七零高地的敌军，将守敌李伪军的两个排全部歼灭，毙伤敌军六十余名。
