(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st) Li Peilin, Zhu Jimin, Chen Shixiang, Lu Baolin, Xu Yingkui, Zhang Xuede, Qin Yaoting, Wu Zhizhong, Xin Jun, and Jing Guanhua, Chinese entomology, bacteriology, internal medicine, and pathology experts who testified before the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team during its investigation of the US imperialist bacteriological warfare crimes in the Northeast, spoke to our agency's reporters. Based on their personal experiences and research results from participating in the anti-bacteriological warfare struggle, they exposed the heinous crimes of US and British imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare, destroying scientific civilization, and slaughtering people worldwide. They expressed unanimous support for the just declaration of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team and condemned the American aggressors whose hands are stained with the blood of the people.

Li Peilin, a pathology expert who received a doctorate from the University of London, a member of the British Pathological Society, said: "As far as I know, US and British imperialism has indeed engaged in long-term preparations for bacteriological warfare. The ruling classes of these countries used threats and inducements to force scientists to serve them. In recent years, the United States has organized scientists to study a polio virus. The results of the research are sent to the military medical school. If they are only for prevention, why concentrate the scientific research results in military organs? When I stayed in Britain during World War II, I refused their transfer to the military to serve, and I knew then that they were already engaged in bacteriological and poison gas warfare research under the guise of 'defense.' These facts prove that British imperialism is an accomplice of US imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare. Now, we have identified an encephalitis caused by bacteria-carrying poisonous insects dropped by US imperialism. This encephalitis is something that has never existed in China before. We used poisonous insects to inoculate animals, and the same results were obtained from the pathological dissection of infected people, proving that this encephalitis was caused by poisonous insects dropped by US imperialism carrying highly virulent viruses. The harm of this encephalitis is very serious. The malicious plot of US imperialism is to destroy our nation and even all of mankind. We scientific workers have the glorious responsibility of protecting the people's health, and I will contribute all my strength to the anti-bacteriological warfare front until the bacteriological war criminals are tried and repay the blood debt to the Chinese and Korean people."

Zhu Jimin, a bacteriology expert who received a doctorate from Cambridge University and a researcher at the British National Institute for Medical Research, said: "This time, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team collected a lot of factual and scientific evidence in the Northeast. Through their work, the people of the world will further recognize the true face of the American murderers. In the US conspiracy to prepare for and conduct bacteriological warfare, British imperialism actually played the role of an accomplice and accomplice. In a place called Staden in the UK, there is a 'Microbiology Research Institute.' This institution is actually engaged in bacteriological warfare research, which has become an open secret well known in Britain."

Chen Shixiang, an entomology expert who has worked in the British Museum, the French Museum, and the German Entomological Research Institute, and who received a doctorate from the University of Paris, said: "I feel very honored to be able to participate in the anti-bacteriological warfare research this time and to testify in the investigation of the US bacteriological warfare crimes. From the recent preliminary research on the poisonous insects dropped by American aircraft, I clearly realized that the means of US imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare are very cunning and vicious. At present, some bacteria-carrying poisonous insects have been found in various parts of the Northeast. In addition to some well-known pests (such as mosquitoes and flies), there are also many insects that are unimportant in entomology. For example, the black fly I identified is generally not a pest and does not arouse much suspicion in the medical community; but this black fly has many villi on its body, and its larvae grow on vegetables. US imperialism uses this condition to cultivate it into a poisonous insect that transmits germs and endangers the people. Although US imperialism wants to use this to conceal its crimes, or to paralyze us, this behavior is enough to prove that its intentions are very sinister and vicious. Now that all the people in the Northeast are mobilized to participate in the struggle against bacteriological warfare, we scientific workers must stand at the forefront of this struggle and contribute our technology to the country and the people. No matter how vicious the methods of US imperialism are, I believe that our struggle against bacteriological warfare will surely win the final victory."

Entomologist Lu Baolin said: "I have examined some insect specimens recently sent from various parts of the Northeast. These insects should not appear under the local climate, geography, and other natural conditions; and bacteriologists have found bacteria on these insects. The military organs have also confirmed that American aircraft have invaded the airspace of these places, which proves that these poisonous insects were indeed dropped by American aircraft. No matter how much US imperialism denies it, these ironclad facts exist. We entomology workers stand on the position of seeking welfare for the people, and we cannot tolerate the crimes of US imperialism. I am willing to participate in the anti-bacteriological warfare work with all my strength. I hope that all entomologists in the country will mobilize and crush the conspiracy of American aggressors to use poisonous insects to kill peaceful people."

Xu Yingkui, a neurology and psychiatry expert who taught at Peking Union Medical College and engaged in research in the Department of Neurology at the University of Chicago in the United States, said: "People all over the world are protesting the US imperialist crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare. We scientific workers are even more angry at this bloodless atrocity. Because the purpose of our scientific workers is to eliminate those poisonous insects and bacteria that cause death and seek welfare for mankind, but US imperialism and its 'scientists' use science as a tool to achieve their aggressive goals and poison peaceful people. This is the most despicable and shameless behavior. We now have sufficient scientific basis to expose and confirm the US imperialist crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare. We must arouse the serious attention of all peace-loving people in the world and unite to sanction the American bacteriological war criminals."

Zhang Xuede, an infectious disease expert who received a master's degree from the University of Illinois in the United States, said: "I personally saw in the United States that medical institutions often use living people as test subjects when testing certain drugs. The American health science organs, whether national or private, are controlled by two institutions: one is the capitalist pharmacy, and the other is the military organs. Scientific research in the United States is actually not free. Even some private doctors often receive orders to engage in research for military organs. I participated in the research of encephalitis virus this time, and an extremely angry mood is inspiring me. I want to use my scientific and technological skills to conduct an unyielding struggle against US imperialism's bacteriological warfare."

Entomologist Qin Yaoting said: "I fully support the correct judgment in the March 28th telegram of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team. Their fair opinions are completely in line with the facts, and I admire their righteous behavior very much. US imperialism recently clamored for the 'International Committee of the Red Cross' to come to China and Korea for investigation. The 'investigation' mission of this notorious tool of US imperialism is nothing more than to come and investigate the effectiveness of bacteriological warfare for its American masters, just like the US and Chiang Kai-shek agents caught on the Korean front a few days ago. We now have the testimony of local residents, and we also have the research conclusions of scientists. Peace-loving righteous people all over the world, like the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team, can testify for us. The heinous crimes of US imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare cannot be denied in any way."

Wu Zhizhong, a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Glasgow and an internal medicine expert who engaged in research at Guy's Hospital of the University of London and the Tuberculosis Research Institute of the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, said: "US imperialism blatantly and on a large scale using a wide variety of bacteria-carrying poisonous insects to conduct bacteriological warfare in such a wide area has never been seen in the history of world warfare. Professor Rosebury of Columbia University in the United States, who participated in the manufacture of bacteriological weapons at Fort Detrick, once arrogantly declared in an article 'On Bacteriological Warfare' (published in the May 1947 issue of the American Journal of Immunology): 'In the past, bacteriological warfare, including that used by Japan in China, was nothing but small-scale, or simply amateur games.' Rosebury also said: 'The important principle of military strategists is that any weapon is a useful weapon as long as it can accomplish a military task, destroy the enemy or its important materials, and does not suffer serious losses itself.' These words fully expose the vicious ambition of US imperialism to prepare for large-scale bacteriological warfare. I hope that all conscientious and peace-loving scientific workers in the world should stand up and stop this heinous crime of US imperialism. Those 'scientists' who are blinded by greed and betray their conscience to act as accomplices in murder for imperialism must withdraw their evil blood hands as soon as possible, otherwise they will never escape the just punishment of the people of the world."

Xin Jun, a bacteriology expert who received a medical doctorate from Nagoya University in Japan, said: "From my research materials, it has been confirmed that US imperialism has used bacteriological weapons on our country's territory. The crime of this bacteriological weapon lies in its attempt to destroy mankind on a large scale. This is the most barbaric, cruel, and inhumane behavior. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team publicized this crime of US imperialism to the world, which will definitely be of great help to the peace cause of the world's people. I think that US imperialism's attempt to use bacteriological weapons to save its fate of failure is completely wishful thinking, because it completely does not understand the great power of the combination of our science and technology and the masses. As long as we find the law of bacterial transmission and epidemic diseases, and rely on the masses, we can put it out. The people of the Northeast have rich experience in putting out various epidemic diseases, and the conspiracy of US imperialism's bacteriological warfare will inevitably be completely bankrupt."

Bacteriologist Jing Guanhua said: "I was born in the Northeast and suffered all kinds of oppression under the rule of Japanese imperialism since I was a child. I feel even more hatred for the crime of US imperialism colluding with Japanese bacteriological war criminals. When I testified to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team, on the one hand, I was excited and sad because of the old and new hatred, and on the other hand, I was also happy to have this opportunity to accuse the crimes of the US and Japanese bacteriological war criminals to the people of the world. The crime of US imperialism using bacteriological weapons is very serious, because this weapon has serious harm not only in the front line but also in the rear, not only at present but also in the future, not only to Korea and China but also to other countries. For thousands of years, many world-renowned scientific workers have dedicated their lives to bacteriological research with the spirit of martyrdom, but their scientific research results have been stolen by US imperialism and used to kill mankind, which is very infuriating. I thank the investigation team for telling the results of this investigation to the people of the world, so that peace-loving mankind can take action to stop the heinous crimes of US imperialism."

    我国昆虫学、细菌学、内科学专家李佩琳等发表谈话
    拥护国际民主法协调查团的公正声明
    痛斥美国侵略者撒布细菌毒虫的罪行
    【新华社沈阳一日电】国际民主法律工作者协会调查团前在东北调查美帝国主义细菌战罪行时，出席作证的我国昆虫学、细菌学、内科学、病理学专家李佩琳、朱既民、陈世骧、陆宝麟、许英魁、张学德、秦耀庭、吴执中、辛钧和景冠华对本社记者发表谈话，以自己的亲身经历和此次参加反细菌战斗争的研究结果，揭露美、英帝国主义进行细菌战、摧毁科学文明、屠杀世界人类的滔天罪行。他们表示一致拥护国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的公正声明，并痛斥双手沾满人民鲜血的美国侵略者。
    曾在英国伦敦大学获得博士学位、英国病理学会会员、病理学专家李佩琳说：据我所知、美、英帝国主义确实从事过长期的细菌战准备工作，这些国家的统治阶级用威胁和利诱的手段，强迫科学家们为其服务。美国近年来组织科学家们研究一种婴儿瘫痪病毒，研究的结果都要送到军医学校部门中去，如果他们只是为了预防，为什么要把科学的研究成果集中到军事机关中去呢？我在第二次世界大战期中留居英国时，曾经拒绝他们把我调到军事机关中服务，我确知那时他们就已借“防御”之名在从事细菌战和毒气战的研究工作。这些事实，证明了英帝国主义是美帝国主义进行细菌战的同谋犯。现在，我们已经判明了一种由美帝国主义投掷细菌毒虫而引起的脑炎，这种脑炎是我国从来不曾有过的。我们用毒虫作动物接种和从染疫者的病理解剖中所得的相同的结果，证明了这种脑炎是由美帝国主义投下的带有烈性病毒的毒虫所引起的。这种脑炎的危害性是非常严重的。美帝国主义的恶毒阴谋是企图毁灭我们的民族乃至全人类。我们科学工作者负有保护人民健康的光荣责任，我一定要在反细菌战线上贡献自己的一切力量，直到细菌战犯被审判、并偿还了中朝人民的血债为止。
    曾在英国剑桥大学获得博士学位、英国国立医学研究院研究员、细菌学专家朱既民说：这次国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在东北收集到很多事实的证据和科学的证据，通过他们的工作，将使全世界人民进一步认清美国杀人凶手的真实面貌。在美国准备和进行细菌战的阴谋中，英帝国主义实际上也起了帮凶和同谋的作用。在英国一个名叫斯丹登的地方，有一个“微生物研究院”，这个机构实际上在从事研究细菌战的工作，这已成为英国尽人皆知的公开的秘密。
    曾在英国博物院、法国博物院、德国昆虫学研究所从事过研究工作，并在法国巴黎大学获得博士学位的昆虫学专家陈世骧说：我这次能参加反细菌战的研究工作，并在调查美国进行细菌战罪行的工作中出席作证，感到非常光荣。从最近对于美国飞机所投毒虫的初步研究中，使我清楚地认识到美帝国主义进行细菌战的手段是非常狡猾和毒辣的。目前在东北各地所发现的一些带菌毒虫，除了其中有一些著名的害虫（如蚊、蝇等）外，还有很多在昆虫学上无关重要的昆虫，例如我所检定的黑蝇，在一般情况下并不属于害虫之类，也不大引起医学界的怀疑；但这种黑蝇身上有很多绒毛，而它的幼虫又是生长在蔬菜上的，美帝国主义就利用这种条件来将它培养成为传染病菌、危害人民的毒虫。虽然美帝国主义要想以此掩饰其罪行，或者以此麻痹我们，但这种行为适足以证明其用心是非常阴险和毒辣的。现在全东北人民都动员起来，参加反细菌战的斗争，我们科学工作者更要站在这一斗争的最前线，把自己的技术贡献给国家和人民，不管美帝国主义手段如何毒辣，我相信我们反细菌战的斗争必将获得最后胜利。
    昆虫学家陆宝麟说：我检视了一些最近从东北各地送来的昆虫标本，这些昆虫在当地气候、地理等自然条件下，都是不应当出现的；而且细菌学专家们已从这些虫子的身上找到了细菌，军事机关又证实了美国飞机侵入这些地方的上空，这就证明了这些毒虫确实是美国飞机扔下来的。不论美帝国主义如何狡赖，这些铁的事实都是存在的。我们昆虫学工作者站在为人民谋福利的立场，对美帝国主义这种罪行决不能容忍，我愿尽全力参加反细菌战的工作。我希望全国一切昆虫学家都动员起来，粉碎美国侵略者利用毒虫杀害和平人民的阴谋。
    曾在北京协和医学院任教、并在美国芝加哥大学神经科从事研究工作的神经、精神病学专家许英魁说：全世界人民都在抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，我们科学工作者对这种杀人不见血的兽行更加愤怒。因为我们科学工作者的目的是要消灭那些致人死命的毒虫和细菌，为人类谋福利，而美帝国主义及其所豢养的“科学家”们，却利用科学作为实现侵略目的、毒杀和平人民的工具，这是一种最卑鄙最无耻的行为。我们现在已有了充分的科学根据来揭发和证实美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，我们必须唤起全世界爱好和平人民的严重注意，一致起来制裁美国细菌战犯。
    曾在美国伊利诺大学获得硕士学位的传染病学专家张学德说：我在美国亲眼看到美国的医学机关在试验某种药品时，都经常用活人作试验对象。美国的卫生科学机关，不论是国家的或私人的，都被两种机构所控制：一个是资本家的大药房，另一个就是军事机关。美国的科学研究工作实际上是没有自由的，就是一些私人医师，也经常接到命令要为军事机关从事研究工作。我这次参加了研究脑炎病毒，一种极端愤怒的心情在鼓舞着我，我要用我的科学技术对美帝国主义细菌战进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    昆虫学专家秦耀庭说：我完全拥护国际民主法律工作者协会调查团三月二十八日电文中的正确判断，他们的公正意见完全合乎事实，他们的正义行为使我非常钦佩。美帝国主义最近叫嚣着要“红十字国际委员会”到中国和朝鲜来调查，这个臭名远扬的美帝国主义的御用组织的“调查”使命，无非是和前几天在朝鲜前线抓到的美、蒋特务一样，是要来替他的美国主子调查细菌战的效果的。我们现在已经有了当地居民提供的事实作证，又有了科学家的研究结论作证，全世界爱好和平的正义人士如同国际民主法律工作者协会调查团一样，都可以为我们作证，美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行是无论如何也抵赖不了的。
    曾为英国格拉斯哥皇家内科医师院院士并在伦敦大学盖氏医院和美国宾西法尼亚大学结核病研究所从事研究工作的内科专家吴执中说：美帝国主义这样明目张胆地、大规模地利用多种多样的带菌毒虫，在如此广泛的地区内进行细菌战，在世界战争历史上是未曾见过的。曾在狄特里克营参加制造细菌武器的美国哥伦比亚大学教授罗兹伯里在一篇“关于细菌战”（刊于一九四七年五月美国免疫学杂志）的论文中，曾经狂妄地宣称：“过去的细菌战，包括日本在中国所使用的，没有一件不是小规模的，或者简直是业余家的游戏而已。”罗兹伯里并且说：“军事家的重要原则是，任何武器在使用时只要能完成一种军事任务，毁灭敌人或其重要物资，而自己又不遭受严重损失，那么这种武器就能是有用的武器。”这些话完全暴露了美帝国主义准备进行大规模细菌战的恶毒野心。我希望世界上一切有良心的、爱好和平的科学工作者，都应起来制止美帝国主义这种滔天罪行，那些利令智昏、昧着良心替帝国主义作杀人帮凶的“科学家”们，必须趁早缩回罪恶的血手，否则他们绝对逃脱不了全世界人民的正义惩罚。
    曾在日本名古屋大学获得医学博士学位的细菌学专家辛钧说：从我的研究材料中，已确实证明美帝国主义在我国国土上使用了细菌武器，这种细菌武器的罪恶，在于它企图大规模的毁灭人类，这是最野蛮、最残忍、毫无人道的行为。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团将美帝国主义这种罪行向全世界公布，对世界人民的和平事业一定会有很大帮助。我认为美帝国主义企图用细菌武器来挽救其失败命运完全是一种妄想，因为它完全不了解我们科学技术和群众相结合的伟大力量。只要我们找到了细菌传播和疫病流行的规律，并且依靠群众，我们就可以扑灭它。东北人民已经有了扑灭各种疫病的丰富经验，美帝国主义细菌战的阴谋必将遭到彻底破产。
    细菌学家景冠华说：我生在东北，从小在日本帝国主义统治下受尽了被压迫的痛苦，我对于美帝国主义勾结日本细菌战犯的罪行更加感到痛恨。我在向国际民主法律工作者协会调查团作证时，一方面为旧恨新仇所激动而感到悲愤，同时也因为能有此机会向世界人民控诉美、日细菌战犯的罪行而感到愉快。美帝国主义使用细菌武器的罪行是非常严重的，因为这种武器不但在前线，而且在后方，不但在目前，而且在将来，不但在朝鲜和中国，而且对其他国家，都有着严重的危害。千百年来，许多世界闻名的科学工作者以殉身的精神在细菌学研究中献出了自己的生命，但是他们的科学研究成果却为美帝国主义所盗窃，用来杀害人类，这是非常令人感到愤怒的。我感谢调查团能将此次调查结果告诉全世界人民，使爱好和平的人类都行动起来，制止美帝国主义的滔天罪行。
