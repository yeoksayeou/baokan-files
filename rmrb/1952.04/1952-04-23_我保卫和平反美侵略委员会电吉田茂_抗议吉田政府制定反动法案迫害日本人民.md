    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on April 22nd, protesting the Yoshida government's enactment of the reactionary "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." The text of the telegram is as follows:

    To Mr. Shigeru Yoshida:

    The Japanese government, led by you, is attempting to formulate the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" in order to further suppress the peaceful and democratic activities of the Japanese people, destroy progressive organizations, and persecute progressive individuals. The essence of this law is to rely on the dictates of American imperialism, further transform Japan into an American imperialist military base for aggression in Asia, and force the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for American imperialist aggression wars, fundamentally violating the principles of democratization of Japan stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese people have expressed unparalleled anger and opposition. We fully sympathize with and support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for peace, democracy, freedom, and independence, and lodge a serious protest against this further reactionary measure of the government led by you.

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, April 22, 1952

    我保卫和平反美侵略委员会电吉田茂
    抗议吉田政府制定反动法案迫害日本人民
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会二十二日致电日本政府首相吉田茂，抗议吉田政府制定反动的“防止破坏活动法案”。电文如下：吉田茂先生：
    你所领导的日本政府为了进一步镇压日本人民的和平民主活动、摧残进步组织与迫害进步人士，正企图制定所谓“防止破坏活动法案”。这一法案的实质，是仰美帝国主义的鼻息，更进一步变日本为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的军事基地，强迫日本人民充当美帝国主义者进行侵略战争的炮灰，根本违反了波茨坦宣言所规定日本民主化的原则。日本人民已表示无比的愤怒和反对。我们完全同情与声援日本人民为和平、民主、自由、独立而进行的英勇斗争，对你所领导的政府这又一反动的措施提出严重的抗议。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会一九五二年四月二十二日
