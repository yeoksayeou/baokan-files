    Liycheng Lichiaoyao Credit Cooperative
    Helps the Masses Prepare for Spring Planting
    Editor: The Liycheng County Sixth District Lichiaoyao Credit Cooperative in Shanxi Province accepted the credit business assigned to them by their superiors in January of last year. All comrades immediately worked hard to study policies and deeply understand and dispel the masses' ideological concerns. In less than a month, they absorbed the masses' savings of grain and shares, totaling more than 28,000 catties of millet. The cooperative immediately lent the stored grain to the masses for production. With the help of the credit cooperative, the masses purchased livestock one after another to prepare for spring planting. Over the past year, the whole village bought 79 donkeys, 4 female donkeys, 18 cattle, and 26 mules, solving the problem of animal power for this year's spring planting.
    The cooperative has solved the production and living difficulties of the masses, and has therefore been enthusiastically supported by the masses. Wu Jian

    黎城栗家窑信用合作社
    扶助群众准备春耕
    编辑同志：山西省黎城县六区栗家窑信用合作社在去年一月接受了上级交给他们的信贷业务，全体同志立即努力学习政策，深入了解、解除群众的思想顾虑，不出一个月，就吸收了群众的存粮和股金共折合小米二万八千多斤。合作社马上把存粮放给群众，进行生产。群众得到信用合作社的扶助，纷纷购买牲畜，准备春耕。一年以来，全村共买了毛驴七十九头，母驴四头，牛十八头，骡子二十六头，解决了今年春耕的畜力问题。
    该社给群众解决了生产上和生活上的困难，因而受到群众热烈的拥护。　武健
