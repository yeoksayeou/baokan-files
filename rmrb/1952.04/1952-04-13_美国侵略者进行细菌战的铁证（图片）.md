Ironclad Evidence of Bacteriological Warfare by American Aggressors

Picture Captions:

    (1) Germ-laden chicken feathers scattered by American aggressors within our borders.

    (2) Germ-laden leaves dropped by American aggressors, discovered in An-tung (now Dandong) City.

    (3) Germ-laden black flies scattered by American aggressors within our borders. These black flies have sharp heads, shiny wings, and are covered in hair. They appeared in swarms on the snow in Northeast China, something never seen before in such cold weather in the local area.

    (4) Germ-laden dung flies scattered by American aggressors within our borders. These dung flies carry paratyphoid bacteria.

    (5) Germ-laden springtails scattered by American aggressors within our borders. These springtails carry rickettsia, which can cause disease in animals.

    (6) Germ-laden spiders scattered by American aggressors within our borders.

    (7) Germ-laden centipede dropped by American aggressors, discovered on March 6th within the territory of Kuan-tien (now Kuandian).

    (8) The germ-laden spiders scattered by American aggressors within our borders were ground into an emulsion. 0.5 cc of this emulsion was injected into the abdominal cavity of a white mouse, and the white mouse died twelve hours later. The spleen of the dead white mouse was then made into an emulsion, and the same amount was injected into other white mice. The other white mice also died the next day. Microscopic observation of the spleens of the dead white mice revealed the presence of Pasteurella bacteria with bipolar staining. The picture shows the morphology of these bacteria.

    (9) The germ-laden chicken feathers scattered by American aggressors were placed in a mortar and washed with sterile saline. The washing solution was injected into the abdominal cavity of a white mouse, and the white mouse died twenty-four hours later. The picture shows the white mouse that died after the injection.

    (10) The germ-laden springtails scattered by American aggressors were ground into an emulsion, and 0.5 cc was injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig. After the injection, the guinea pig's body temperature rose, its weight decreased sharply, and it died on the eighth day. The picture shows the dead guinea pig. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国侵略者进行细菌战的铁证
    图片说明
    （一）美国侵略者在我国境内撒布的带菌鸡毛。
    （二）在安东市发现的美国侵略者所投下的带菌树叶。
    （三）美国侵略者撒布在我国境内的带菌黑蝇。这种黑蝇头尖翅亮，遍体是毛，在东北的雪地上成群地出现，是当地在这样寒冷天气所从来没有看见过的。
    （四）美国侵略者在我国境内撒布的带菌粪蝇。这种粪蝇带有副伤寒菌。
    （五）美国侵略者撒布在我国境内的带菌跳虫。这种跳虫带有使动物致病的立克次氏体。
    （六）美国侵略者在我国境内撒布的带菌蜘蛛。
    （七）三月六日在宽甸境内发现的美国侵略者所投下的带菌蜈蚣。
    （八）将美国侵略者在我国境内撒布的带菌蜘蛛磨碎制成乳剂，以0．5西西接种于小白鼠腹腔内，十二小时后小白鼠死亡。再用死亡小白鼠的脾脏制成乳剂，用同量接种其他小白鼠，次日其他小白鼠亦死亡。在显微镜下观察死亡小白鼠的脾脏，可见含有两端浓染之巴斯德属杆菌。图为该项细菌的形态。
    （九）将美国侵略者撒布的带菌鸡毛置于乳钵中用无菌的生理盐水捣洗，将捣洗液注射于小白鼠的腹腔内，二十四小时后小白鼠死亡。图为经注射后死亡的小白鼠。
    （十）把美国侵略者撒下的带菌跳虫磨碎作成乳剂，取0．5西西注射于豚鼠皮下，注射后豚鼠体温升高、体重锐减，于第八日死亡。图为死亡后的豚鼠。  （新华社稿）
