    Learning about the Instructions on Secondary Technical Education
    We Must Correct Erroneous Learning Attitudes
    To the Editor: After studying the "Instructions on Rectification and Development of Secondary Technical Education" promulgated by the Government Administration Council, we deeply realized the importance and concern that the People's Government has for secondary technical education, as well as the important position of secondary technical schools in the school system. At the same time, from these instructions, we also recognized the importance of on-campus and off-campus experiments and internships, and the error of a purely technical perspective.
    The motherland has such ardent expectations of us, but some students still have serious erroneous thinking in their studies. For example, some students do not have a correct understanding of studying agriculture, thinking: "There is no future in studying agriculture, it's just turning over the soil." Some students also have a purely technical viewpoint, neglecting political study. They say: "With technology, we will have food to eat in the future." "If I study veterinary medicine well, I can open a veterinary hospital in the future." "If I study horticulture well, I can play the violin under the fruit trees in the future." Some students also have a very wrong understanding of experiments and internships, thinking that they are to "relax" outside of classroom learning; they also do not write internship reports after the internship. If these ideas continue to exist, how can we complete the tasks assigned by the people? We must overcome these erroneous ideas and establish correct learning attitudes. Only in this way can we learn our skills well and strive to build a great motherland.

### 学习关于中等技术教育的指示后  我们要纠正错误的学习态度

    学习关于中等技术教育的指示后
    我们要纠正错误的学习态度
    编辑同志：我们学习了政务院所颁布的“关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示”后，深刻地认识到人民政府对中等技术教育的重视和关心，以及中等技术学校在学校系统中的重要地位。同时，从这个指示中，我们又认识到校内校外实验、实习的重要性和单纯技术观点的错误。
    祖国对我们的期望是这样殷切，但是有些同学在学习中还有着严重的错误思想。譬如有些同学对学习农业没有正确的认识，认为：“学习农业没出息，只是翻翻土罢了。”也有些同学有着单纯技术观点，忽视政治学习。他们说：“有了技术，将来就有饭吃。”“学好兽医，自己将来可以开兽医院。”
    “学好园艺，将来可以在果树下拉提琴。”还有些同学对实验和实习的认识是很错误的，认为这是为了在课堂学习之外“松脑筋”；实习以后也不作实习报告。要是让这些思想继续存在下去，我们怎能完成人民交给的任务呢？我们必须克服这些错误思想，树立正确的学习态度。只有这样，我们才能学好本领，为建设伟大的祖国而奋斗。
