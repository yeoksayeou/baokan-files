    Instructions on Improving Cultivation Techniques to Increase Cotton Yield Per Unit Area
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued "Instructions on Improving Cultivation Techniques to Increase Cotton Yield Per Unit Area." The instructions point out that the country should increase cotton production by another 20 percent this year based on 1951, but the cotton planting area cannot be expanded. Therefore, increasing the cotton yield per unit area is a serious task in this year's agricultural production. In order to concentrate efforts on increasing the unit area yield of cotton fields, the following suggestions are made for improving cotton planting techniques:
    1. Cotton sowing must be timely. In northern cotton areas, cotton sown around the Grain Rain period can produce twice as much as cotton sown around the Grain Full period. Last year, more than five million mu of cotton fields in northern cotton areas reduced production due to delayed sowing while waiting for rain. To achieve timely sowing, it is necessary to preserve soil moisture in cotton fields. Last year, some areas emphasized plowing twice in spring cultivation, which resulted in the deterioration of the topsoil. Northern cotton areas must pay attention to this this year, and should strive to prevent drought and conserve soil moisture to ensure timely sowing. Cotton fields in the Yangtze River Basin are double-cropped, and farmers mostly use broadcast sowing for cotton planting. In recent years, some cotton areas in the Yangtze River Basin have made progress in promoting row sowing, which should be continued to increase cotton field yield. The method of row sowing cotton in alfalfa fields created in the Subei reclamation area is also worth promoting.
    2. Rich harvest experience has proven that in addition to using more organic base fertilizer, cotton fields should also use some refined fertilizer. The amount of refined fertilizer should be appropriate, not too much. Last year, Song Chengquan, a farmer in Handan, Hebei, applied 1,000 jin of refined fertilizer per mu, but did not increase production. However, cotton fields must use refined fertilizer. At present, the majority of cotton farmers are accustomed to using bean cake. Various localities should plan to supply cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizers, and teach farmers how to use them.
    3. Prepare sufficient medicines and machinery as early as possible. For cotton field diseases and insect pests, all localities should implement the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment" and "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment."
    4. This year, the work of maintaining the purity of improved cotton varieties is very important. Seed breeding areas and seed promotion areas should continue to implement field selection and indoor seed selection. All localities promoting improved varieties must conduct seed identification and germination tests.
    5. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, cotton must be appropriately densely planted to achieve a rich harvest. In the future, all localities should appropriately "widen row spacing and shorten plant spacing," and gradually increase density based on the original number of plants per mu and according to the level of cultivation. Cotton fields with poor production conditions should improve technology in terms of fertilization, irrigation, and pruning to better leverage the conditions for dense planting and rich harvest.
    6. Cotton must be pruned to achieve a rich harvest. In recent years, cotton areas in the Yellow River Basin and Northeast China have proven that implementing pruning can increase yield and also promote early maturity. Soviet cotton planting also has this experience. In the future, pruning techniques should be universally promoted in northern cotton areas, and gradually promoted in southern cotton areas as well.
    The instructions finally pointed out that the agricultural departments of people's governments at all levels must implement the policy of increasing the cotton yield per unit area, vigorously strengthen the organization and leadership of technical improvement work, formulate work plans for popularizing technology according to local conditions, carry out mass movements to improve technology, and complete this year's cotton production increase task.

### 中央人民政府农业部发布  关于改进栽培技术提高棉花单位面积产量的指示

    中央人民政府农业部发布
    关于改进栽培技术提高棉花单位面积产量的指示
    中央人民政府农业部发布“关于改进栽培技术提高棉花单位面积产量的指示”。指示指出：全国今年应在一九五一年的基础上再增产棉花百分之二十，但是植棉面积不能扩大。为此，提高棉花单位面积产量是今年农业生产中的一项严重任务。为了集中力量提高棉田的单位面积产量，特提出下列改进植棉技术的几项意见：
    一、棉花播种必须及时。北方各棉区在谷雨前后播种的棉花，可比小满前后播种的多产一倍。去年，北方各棉区有五百多万亩棉田，因等雨播种过迟，因而减产。要做到适期播种，便要棉田保墒。去年有的地区强调春耕翻二犁，结果墒土变坏。今年北方棉区对此必须注意，应讲求防旱保墒，保证及时播种。长江流域棉田是两熟田，农民种棉多用撒播。近两年来长江流域有些棉区推广条播已有成绩，应继续推广以求提高棉田产量。苏北盐垦区创造的在苜蓿地里条播棉花的办法也值得推广。
    二、丰产经验证明了棉田施肥除多用有机质基肥外，还要用些细肥。用细肥要适量，不要太多。去年河北邯郸农民宋成全每亩施细肥一千斤，并未增产。但是，棉田却必须用细肥。现在，广大棉农已惯用豆饼，各地应有计划地供应饼肥和化学肥料，并把使用的方法教给农民。
    三、及早准备好充足的药械。对棉田的病虫害，各地应贯彻“防重于治”和“早治、普治、连续治、彻底治”的方针。
    四、今年，棉花良种保纯的工作很重要，良种繁殖区和良种推广区，要继续贯彻田间选种和室内粒选。各地推广良种，必须进行种子鉴定和发芽试验。
    五、根据苏联的先进经验，棉花必须适当密植才能丰收。今后，各地应酌量“放宽行距，缩短株距”，在原来每亩株数的基础上，根据耕作水平，逐步增加密度。生产条件不好的棉田，应在施肥、灌溉、整枝等方面提高技术，更好地发挥密植丰收条件。
    六、棉花必须整枝才能丰收。近年黄河流域和东北的棉区证明，实行整枝可提高产量，还可促进早熟。苏联植棉也有这个经验。今后北方棉区应普遍推行整枝技术，南方棉区也应逐渐推广。
    指示最后指出：各级人民政府的农业部门，必须贯彻提高棉花单位面积产量的方针，大力加强技术改进工作的组织领导，根据当地具体情况，订出普及技术的工作计划，开展群众性的提高技术运动，完成今年的棉花增产任务。（新华社）
