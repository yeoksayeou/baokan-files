Develop Su Changyou's Advanced Experience of "Segmented Bricklaying Method"
Tianjin Fu Hongbin Creates "Circular Bricklaying Method"
Efficiency Increased More Than Threefold Compared to the Old Method, Nearly Doubled Compared to the "Segmented Bricklaying Method"

Fu Hongbin, the bricklayer team leader of the Engineering Team of the Tianjin Branch of the State-owned China Transportation Construction Enterprise General Company, learned Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method," and with the help of engineers and many fellow workers, continued to work hard and further developed Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method," creating a new "Circular Bricklaying Method." According to preliminary trials in several projects, each person (including apprentices) can lay an average of 2,100 to 2,500 bricks per day (eight hours), which is more than three times the work efficiency of the old bricklaying method, and nearly double the work efficiency of Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method." If Fu Hongbin's "Circular Bricklaying Method" can be popularized, it will create huge wealth for the country every year, and at the same time, it will save a large number of skilled bricklayers to be put into various national basic construction projects. The Tianjin Municipal Construction Trade Union is preparing to widely promote the "Circular Bricklaying Method" among construction workers in the city, and plans to start implementing this new working method in the construction of the first batch of 10,000 workers' dormitories.

Last autumn, Su Changyou, a national model worker in the construction industry, visited Tianjin and introduced his "Segmented Bricklaying Method" to the construction workers of Tianjin, which was warmly welcomed. The administrative and trade union leaders of the State-owned China Transportation Construction Enterprise General Company's Tianjin Branch called on all construction workers to learn from Su Changyou's advanced experience in bricklaying. The young bricklayer Fu Hongbin was determined to learn from Su Changyou. But at that time, he was working on a construction site and was unable to see Su Changyou's bricklaying performance. After several explorations and studies with the workers in the team, there were no results. But he was not discouraged. With the encouragement and help of engineer Liu Junzhu, he continued to study and designed a paving tool. This tool was initially just a wooden frame made of several wooden boards. The mortar was placed in the frame, leveled with a ruler, and then the bricks were laid. The effect was very good after trial use. After continuing to study and seek improvement, a wooden baffle was nailed to the back of this wooden frame to replace the ruler for leveling the mortar, and the efficiency was improved again. Fu Hongbin took this preliminary paving tool to the team for everyone to study and improve together. Supervisor Chen Jinfa suggested nailing two iron plates next to the wooden baffle to make the mortar paving smooth and wear-resistant; bricklayer Zhang Wensheng suggested carving two grooves under the wooden baffle to leave room for head joints; and nailing several small wooden strips to the wooden baffle to create small grooves on the mortar surface to adjust the thickness of the bricks and prevent the laid wall from being uneven. This collectively created bricklaying mortar paving tool was relatively complete. After several experiments by Fu Hongbin and bricklayer Zhang Wensheng, it was proved that using the mortar paving tool to spread the mortar was indeed very effective. At the same time, the use of this new tool prompted them to further study the improvement of processes and labor organization. With the help of engineer Liu Junzhu, based on Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method" and combined with the use of their own mortar paving tool, they finally created the "Circular Bricklaying Method."

The difference between Fu Hongbin's "Circular Bricklaying Method" and Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method" mainly lies in the former's creation of a mortar paving tool. The structure of this tool is not complicated and the cost is very low. It is simply made by nailing several wooden boards together, adding a wooden baffle at the back to form a dustpan shape. A small groove is carved on each end of the wooden baffle, and several wooden strips are nailed in the middle. A handle is installed on top of the wooden baffle. When laying bricks, this mortar paving tool is placed on the wall, and the worker pours the mortar into the hopper of the paving tool, then pushes the tool forward, and the mortar is spread on the bricks. In terms of labor organization, the division of labor in the "Circular Bricklaying Method" is in principle the same as Su Changyou's "Segmented Bricklaying Method"; however, because the mortar paving tool is used to spread the mortar, the time for bricklayers to spread the mortar is further reduced, and the bricklaying speed is faster. At the same time, the labor organization must be more compact to make the various operations consistent. Therefore, Fu Hongbin's bricklaying method generally consists of a team of five or six people (one first- or second-class bricklayer, one second- or third-class bricklayer, and three or four apprentices) working simultaneously. Their division of labor is as follows: one first- or second-class bricklayer is responsible for laying the lines and building the outer skin of the wall, one apprentice is responsible for spreading the mortar, one second- or third-class bricklayer is responsible for building the inner skin of the wall, one apprentice is responsible for selecting and delivering the bricks, and one apprentice is responsible for filling the core and grouting. When the work begins, the first-class bricklayer first lays the lines, the apprentice responsible for spreading the mortar shovels the mortar into the mortar paving tool and pushes it forward, the apprentice responsible for delivering the bricks delivers two bricks with both hands, one inside and one outside, and the first- and second-class bricklayers simultaneously build the outer and inner skins of the wall, and another apprentice follows behind, filling the core and grouting. This cycle is repeated, so it is called the "Circular Bricklaying Method." This working method has the following five advantages: (1) It reduces the non-technical operations of skilled workers, so that skilled workers can use all their energy to do more technical work. (2) It reduces non-productive time. (3) The division of labor is clear, and each person specializes in a certain job, making it easy to become proficient in operating techniques and reducing fatigue. (4) It is easy to train skilled workers. (According to the experience of Fu Hongbin, Yao Zengyi, and others, an apprentice can become a skilled worker after studying for half a year.) (5) It can guarantee the quality of the project. When building walls with the "Circular Bricklaying Method," the work is advanced in sequence, and the mortar cannot be sloppy at all, and there is no way to cut corners, so the mortar in the walls is full and the project is solid.

Fu Hongbin encountered many difficulties in creating the new bricklaying method, but with the support of the administrative and trade union leaders and the help of engineers and fellow workers in the team, they were overcome. When Fu Hongbin began to study the new bricklaying method last autumn, it aroused dissatisfaction among some conservative old skilled workers. Some said: "What can a kid in his twenties do?" But Fu Hongbin never lost heart. He still thought about the tool he had created while lying in bed at night. Fu Hongbin's new bricklaying method was spread, and engineers from construction companies in Tianjin and other cities came to Fu Hongbin to draw detailed drawings of the mortar paving tool. Fellow workers from the China Construction Company at the Tangshan construction site and a certain construction site in Tianjin wrote letters to challenge Fu Hongbin and learn his advanced working method. The administration also tried its best to support him, and allocated forty houses in Nanlou to the Fu Hongbin team for experiments with the new working method; the company manager also often came to the construction site to encourage them. When contracting to build these forty houses, the Fu Hongbin team achieved even more outstanding results. They only used eight bricklayers and completed the task in twelve days; if the old bricklaying method was used, it would have taken forty bricklayers half a month to complete the task.

    发展苏长有“分段砌砖法”的先进经验
    天津傅鸿宾创造“循环砌砖法”
    效率比旧法提高三倍多，比“分段砌砖法”提高近一倍
    国营中国交通建设企业总公司天津分公司工程队瓦工组长傅鸿宾，学习了苏长有的“分段砌砖法”，并由工程师和许多工友帮助，继续努力钻研，进一步发展了苏长有的“分段砌砖法”，创造出新的“循环砌砖法”。据初步在数处工程中试行的结果，每人（包括徒工）每天（八小时）平均可砌砖两千一百至两千五百块，较旧式砌砖法的工作效率提高三倍以上，较苏长有的“分段砌砖法”提高工作效率将近一倍。傅鸿宾的“循环砌砖法”如能加以推广，每年将给国家创造出巨大的财富，同时并能节省出大批有技术的瓦工，投入国家各种基本建设工程。天津市建筑工会准备在全市建筑工人中普遍推广“循环砌砖法”，并拟在修建首批一万间工人宿舍中，开始实行这个新工作法。
    去年秋季，全国建筑工人劳动模范苏长有到天津参观，曾向天津市建筑工人介绍了他的“分段砌砖法”，受到天津市建筑工人热烈欢迎。国营中国交通建设企业总公司天津分公司的行政和工会领导方面，号召全体建筑工人学习苏长有砌砖法的先进经验。青年瓦工傅鸿宾决心向苏长有学习。但当时他正在工地里做工，没能看到苏长有砌砖法的表演。经过几次和组内的工友摸索研究，毫无成果。但他并不灰心，在工程师刘均竹的鼓励和帮助之下，继续钻研，设计出一种铺灰工具。这种工具最初只是用几块木板钉成的一个木框子，把灰放在框子里用尺子刮平再砌砖，经试用后效果很好。经继续钻研，再求改进，又在这个木框的后面钉上一个木档，代替刮灰用的尺子，效率较前又提高一些。傅鸿宾便把这个初步创制的铺灰工具拿到小组里让大家共同研究改进。监工陈金发建议在木档旁钉上两块铁板，使铺灰时光滑耐磨；瓦工张文声建议在木档子下面刻两道槽，以便留出碰头灰；并在木档上钉上几个小木条，为的在灰面上拉出些小沟，调剂砖的薄厚不同，防止砌出的墙不平。这个集体创制的砌砖铺灰工具就比较完善了。经过傅鸿宾和瓦工张文声等数次试验，证明利用铺灰工具铺灰，效果确实很好。同时，由于这种新工具的使用，促使他们进一步研究对工序和劳动力组织的改进。在工程师刘均竹的帮助下，他们从苏长有“分段砌砖法”的基础上，结合自己的铺灰工具的使用，终于创造出“循环砌砖法”。
    傅鸿宾“循环砌砖法”和苏长有“分段砌砖法”的区别，主要在于前者创造了铺灰工具。这种工具的构造并不复杂，成本也很低。仅用数块木板钉在一起，后面加一木档成簸箕形，木档下面靠两头处，各刻一小槽，中间钉上数根木条，木档上面装一个手把就成了。砌砖时，把这铺灰工具骑在墙上，工徒把灰先倒在铺灰工具的斗子内，然后把工具向前推，灰就铺在砖上。在劳动力的组织上，
    “循环砌砖法”的分工原则上和苏长有“分段砌砖法”相同；但因为使用了铺灰工具铺灰，又进一步减少了瓦工铺灰的时间，砌砖速度更快；同时，劳动力的组织，也就必须更加紧凑，才能使各种操作步调一致。所以，傅鸿宾的砌砖法一般是五人或六人组成一个小组（一个一等或二等瓦工，一个二等或三等瓦工，三个或四个徒工），同时进行工作。他们的分工是这样的：一个一等或二等瓦工负责挂线和砌墙外皮，一个徒工负责铺灰，一个二等或三等瓦工负责砌墙里皮，一个徒工负责选砖、递砖，一个徒工负责填心、灌浆。当工作开始时，一等瓦工先挂好线，负责铺灰的徒工即将灰铲入铺灰工具中，向前推进，负责递砖的徒工用两手递上两块砖，一里一外，一、二等瓦工同时砌墙外皮和里皮，另一徒工跟在后面，填心、灌浆，如此往返循环操作，所以称为“循环砌砖法”。这个工作法有以下五个优点：（一）减少了技术工人的非技术操作，技术工人可以用全力多干技术活。（二）减少非生产时间。（三）分工明确，每个人专作一定的工作，操作技术易于熟练，且可减少疲劳。（四）易于培养技术工人。（据傅鸿宾、姚增义等试行的经验，一个徒工学习半年即可成为技术工人。）（五）可以保证工程质量。用“循环砌砖法”砌墙，按工作顺序推进，灰浆一点都不能马虎，并且无法偷工减料，因而所砌的墙浆满?足，工程坚固。
    傅鸿宾在创造新砌砖法时，曾遭遇了不少困难，但在行政和工会领导方面的支持和工程师、组内工友的帮助下，都得以克服。当傅鸿宾去年秋天开始研究新砌砖法时，曾引起部分思想保守的老技术工人的不满，有的说：“二十多岁的毛孩子，能干个嘛事？”但是傅鸿宾始终没有灰心。他夜里躺在床上还想着自己所创造的工具。傅鸿宾的新砌砖法被传扬开了，天津市和其他城市的建筑公司各现场的工程师都找傅鸿宾，画去铺灰工具的详图。中国建筑公司在唐山工地及天津某工地的工友特写信向傅鸿宾挑战，学习他的先进工作法。行政方面也尽力支持他，划出南楼四十间房子给傅鸿宾小组作新工作法的试验；公司经理也常到工程现场鼓励他们。在包做这四十间房子时，傅鸿宾小组更创优异成绩。他们仅用了八个瓦工，以十二天的时间就完成任务了；如果以旧式砌砖工作，则需要四十个瓦工，半个月的时间才能完工。（天津日报）
