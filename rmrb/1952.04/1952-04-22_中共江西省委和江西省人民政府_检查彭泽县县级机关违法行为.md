To the Editorial Department: After seeing the letter from Comrade Wang Zhenhua published in the People's Daily's "Reader's Letters" column, exposing the illegal and undisciplined activities of county-level organs in Pengze County, Jiangxi, we decided on February 15th to organize an inspection team composed of the Provincial People's Government Supervision Committee, the Provincial Personnel Department, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Xu Rujian of the Supervision Committee. The team departed on the 17th to conduct an investigation. We also telegraphed the Jiujiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiujiang Commissioner's Office to immediately organize an inspection team, led personally by the Prefectural Committee Secretary, to go to Pengze County to cooperate in investigating and handling this matter. After ten days of on-site inspection, auditing accounts, and individual interviews, it was proven that the materials exposed by Comrade Wang Zhenhua were factual, with the exception of a few figures, and that some problems were even more serious than those exposed. The preliminary results of the inspection are now described as follows:

	I. A total of 338,130 jin of rice and 200,108,093 yuan in cash, representing various project funds and various fiscal revenues, were withheld, fraudulently claimed, or hidden by county-level organs. The items withheld, fraudulently claimed, or falsely reported and hidden include more than ten types such as relief grain, education funds, construction funds, and granary construction funds.

	II. The county's organs used various illegal means to fraudulently obtain bank loans of 232.5 million yuan, use more than 100,000 jin of public grain, 41,000 jin of agricultural loans, and withhold more than 200 million yuan of organ production funds for speculation and profiteering. Throughout the county, from the county level to the district level, every unit engaged in small-scale household production. For example, the county government had a charcoal factory, a lime kiln, a brick and tile kiln, a dyeing and weaving factory, a cotton ginning factory, a rice mill, a cedar timber station, an electric light factory, an oil mill, etc. They did everything that could make money in the county. They even borrowed money in the name of others, or individuals came forward, found private merchants to guarantee them, and fraudulently obtained loans from state banks. In order to seek exorbitant profits, many county-level organs in the county did not hesitate to violate policies, undermine finance, and disrupt the market. For example, in 1950, the provincial government instructed that logging of forests was prohibited, but the county government itself violated the provincial government's forest logging regulations and the strict prohibition by the Special District Financial and Economic Committee against organs and troops engaging in timber business. They used public grain and public funds to operate a cedar timber station, arbitrarily felled trees, and transported them to Wuhu and Nanjing for sale. The county's organ production group, the Grand Dyeing and Weaving Factory, even sold its own stock of twill fabric at a price of 15,000 yuan per bolt, at a time when the cotton yarn and fabric company was lacking twill fabric in November 1951.

	III. Many county-level organs in Pengze County engaged in usury. For example, the county brigade, from 1949 until the start of the "Three-Anti" campaign, loaned more than 100 shi of rice to private merchants, with a monthly interest rate of 6% to 10%. Other organs, such as the Pengze County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Youth League Committee, and the Women's Federation, also engaged in usury.

	IV. Many organs and factories in the county demolished civilian houses during construction without providing sufficient compensation to the residents, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses.

	V. Seriously lost their class standpoint. In the county seat, sewing workers worked 18 hours a day and were subjected to various cruel exploitations by the capitalists. When the workers demanded one hour of rest per day, the capitalists threatened them with dismissal. Enraged by this injustice, the workers went on strike for half a day to protest. The County People's Government not only failed to punish the capitalists but instead forced the workers to write confessions.

Judging from the above small portion of facts, the illegal activities and lack of discipline of the leading organs at the county level in Pengze County are extremely serious, resulting in a very bad influence on the Party and the People's Government among the masses. The main responsibility should be borne by County Magistrate Fang Shucai (Fang Shucai himself lived extravagantly and is suspected of major corruption, which is still under investigation). Fang Shucai has now been expelled from the Party and removed from his administrative position. We will further investigate other relevant personnel and give them the punishment they deserve.

Regarding the part that infringed on the interests of the masses, we have ordered the leading organs of Pengze County to publicly apologize to the masses and provide appropriate compensation in material terms.

### 中共江西省委和江西省人民政府  检查彭泽县县级机关违法行为

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共江西省委和江西省人民政府
    检查彭泽县县级机关违法行为
    编辑同志：我们看到人民日报读者来信栏所载王振华同志检举江西彭泽县县级机关违法乱纪的信后，就在二月十五日决定由省人民政府人民监察委员会、省人事厅、中共江西省委纪律检查委员会共同组织检查组，由监委许如鉴任组长，于十七日前往检查；并电示中共九江地委、九江专员公署立即组织检查组，由地委书记亲自率领，赴彭泽县配合检查处理这个问题。经过十天的实地检查、清查账目和个别谈话，证明王振华同志所揭发的材料，除个别数字外，都是事实，甚至有某些问题比所揭发的更加严重。现在把检查的初步结果分述如下：
    一、各种事业粮款和各种财政收入，计大米三十三万八千一百三十斤，现款两亿零一十万八千零九十三元，被该县县级机关克扣、冒领或打了埋伏。克扣、冒领或虚报、打埋伏的项目计有救济粮、教育经费、修建费、建仓费等十余种。
    二、该县各机关利用各种非法手段，骗取银行贷款二亿三千二百五十万元，动用公粮十万余斤，农贷四万一千斤，克扣冒领机关生产款两亿余元，用来投机倒把，牟取暴利。全县从县到区，各个单位都搞小家务生产。如县府就有木炭厂、石灰窑、砖瓦窑、染织厂、轧花厂、米厂、杉木站、电灯厂、油坊等，凡是在该县能赚钱的，他们无一不做。他们甚至假借名义，或者个人出面，找私商作保，向国家银行骗取贷款。为了牟取暴利，该县不少县级机关不惜违犯政策，破坏金融，扰乱市场。如一九五零年省府指示不准砍伐森林，县府自身却违背省府森林砍伐规定及专区财经委员会严禁机关部队做木材生意的指示，动用公粮公款，经营杉木站，随意砍伐林木，运往芜湖南京出售。该县机关生产群大染织厂，在一九五一年十一月间，竟在花纱布公司缺乏斜纹布时，将所存自织斜纹布，每疋高抬市价一万五千元出售。
    三、彭泽县不少县级机关放高利贷。如县大队从一九四九年至“三反”运动开始时，先后放给私商米百余石，月息百分之六至百分之十。其他如中共彭泽县委员会、青委、妇联等机关都出放高利贷。
    四、该县不少机关和工厂在修建房屋时，拆掉民房，而没有给住户足够的补偿，引起群众十分不满。
    五、严重丧失立场。该县城内缝衣工人每日工作十八小时，还受资方各种残酷剥削，工人提出每日休息一小时的要求，资方就以解雇威胁。工人激于义愤，停工半日，以示抗议。该县人民政府不但不对资本家加以惩处，反迫使工人写悔过书。
    从上述一小部分事实看，彭泽县县级领导机关的违法乱纪，目无组织等错误是极端严重的，结果给党和人民政府在群众中造成了极坏的影响。主要责任应由县长方述才来负（方述才本人平日生活铺张，有重大贪污嫌疑，正继续追查中）。方述才现在已被开除党籍，撤销行政职务。我们对其他有关人员亦将进一步检查，分别给以应得之处分。
    对于侵犯群众利益部分，我们已责令彭泽县领导机关向群众公开道歉，并在物质上给以相当之补偿。
