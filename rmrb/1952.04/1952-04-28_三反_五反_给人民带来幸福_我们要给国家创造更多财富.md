    "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Bring Happiness to the People
    We Must Create More Wealth for the Country
    Comrade Editor: The great "May Day" International Labor Day is coming amidst the victorious situation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. I feel very happy. We are determined to create new records and ensure the completion of production tasks to welcome "May Day."
    In our factory's infrastructure construction, due to collusion and sabotage by unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements, we lost more than 3.6 billion yuan. This is just one example. Whenever we think of this, our chests fill with hatred, and our eyes burn with anger. If we don't completely eliminate all the rat thieves who steal the state's wealth, how can the wealth we workers create be preserved? Our team actively participated in the fight against "tigers." But we did not relax production. We are constantly thinking of the most beloved people at the front lines, which is an unparalleled driving force that makes us forget fatigue when we work. In the past three months, we have created a total of 52 new records, saved 138 workdays, and saved more than 18 tons of grain. Our team members Mao Pishen and Wang Kexiang created the "circular work method," which greatly improved the output and quality of finished products. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have brought happiness to the people, and new atmospheres are everywhere. More than 600 kinds of daily necessities have been reduced in price, which has never happened before. Our factory's cafeteria has also changed! We pay the same amount for meals as before, but now we can often eat eggs, fish, and large shrimp. In the past, the dishes were like boiled water, and there was only half a bowl. Our prospects are infinitely bright, but we know that the American bandits are still waging a war of aggression in Korea. In order to build our motherland and strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea, we have decided to improve quality on the basis of existing production and create more wealth for the country.

    “三反”“五反”给人民带来幸福
    我们要给国家创造更多财富
    编辑同志：伟大的“五一”劳动节，在“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利形势下来临了。我觉得非常高兴。我们决以创造新纪录，保证完成生产任务来迎接“五一”。
    我厂在基本建设中，因为奸商和贪污分子勾结捣鬼，损失了三十六亿多元。这只是一个例子。我们一想起这件事，就仇恨填胸，两眼冒火。再不把所有盗窃国家财富的鼠贼肃清，我们工人创造的财富怎么能够保全？我们小组积极参加了打“虎”战斗。但我们并没有放松生产。我们时刻想念着在前线的最可爱的人，这是无比的推动力，它使我们干活忘了疲劳。三个月来，我们共创新纪录五十二次，省工一百三十八个，节约粮食十八吨多。我们小组毛丕深、王克祥创造了“循环工作法”，大大提高了成品的产量质量。“三反”、“五反”运动给人民带来了幸福，到处充满了新气象。市场上已有六百多种日用品减了价，这是过去从来没有过的事。我们工厂的食堂也变了样啦！我们出了和从前同样的菜钱，现在居然能常吃鸡蛋、鱼、大虾了，过去的菜却像清水煮的一样，还只有半碗。我们的远景是无限光明的，但我们知道美国强盗还在朝鲜进行侵略战争。为了建设祖国，加强抗美援朝，我们决定在现有的生产基础上，提高质量，给国家创造更多的财富。国营青岛纺织机械厂劳动模范    刘同诰
