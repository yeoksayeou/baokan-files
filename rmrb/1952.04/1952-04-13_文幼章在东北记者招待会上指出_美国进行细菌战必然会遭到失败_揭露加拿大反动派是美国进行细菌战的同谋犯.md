Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th -- Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, who came to the Northeast to investigate the crimes of US imperialism's germ warfare, held a press conference at 3 pm on the 10th. Reporters from the Northeast Branch of Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Daily, Labor Daily, Northeast Youth Daily, Shenyang Daily, Northeast People's Broadcasting Station, and other units attended the press conference. Wen Youzhang answered the questions raised by the reporters.

He first said: I came to the Northeast, visited health agencies and people from all walks of life, saw the various evidences of the US government's germ warfare, and after conducting on-the-spot investigations, confirmed that the US government is carrying out a large-scale germ warfare on Chinese territory. Although the US government dares not admit it today, and the British Foreign Office is also helping it defend itself; however, as long as a person is fair and without prejudice, after seeing this evidence, one cannot but admit it. He also said: The US will inevitably fail in its germ warfare because it does not understand the strength of the people of New China and overestimates its own "propaganda." It neither understands nor wants to understand the fact that New China really has the means and the strength. During my on-the-spot investigation, I personally saw rural women learning injections in a short period of time, and the people all believe that their own strength can defeat the US germ warfare; at the same time, the government is also a capable government. The US war-mongers, like Hitler, blindly believe in themselves without estimating the strength of the people, so the final failure is inevitable.

In answering the question about his opinion on the World Peace Council Executive Bureau's Oslo meeting's "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare," Wen Youzhang said: The World Peace Council is a new force, a great force, and the most reliable weapon for defending peace. It has had the power in the past to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to oppose and stop the use of atomic weapons, and today it has even more power to stop inhumane germ warfare. The power of the peace movement is invincible in all countries, and the situation is the same in Canada: more than 370 representatives participated in the first Canadian Peace Congress, more than 2,000 in the second, and 3,200 in the third. The peace congress to be held soon will have 5,000 representatives attending. In the most difficult circumstances, we already have more than 300,000 people signing the declaration in support of the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. I believe that the Canadian people and all peace-loving people around the world will definitely firmly support the resolutions of the Oslo meeting.

In answering a question about how US germ warfare criminals are preparing for germ warfare, Wen Youzhang revealed that Canadian accomplices are the US's henchmen in carrying out germ warfare. He said: As far as I know, a large-scale germ factory has been established in Nuffield, Alberta, Canada, using artificial cultivation of various bacteria and insects that harm people, livestock, and crops. The head of this institution is named Sorend, who once published an article in the "Reader's Digest" magazine in the United States, openly saying: The prospect of large-scale extermination of human beings in the future is bright. It can be seen that these guys have no humanitarian spirit at all. He pointed out that reactionaries know that their destruction is inevitable; therefore, they develop a nihilistic ideology. Hitler was like this, and so are the American reactionaries. There are also similar institutions in many places in the United States. I believe that the large number of bacteria-carrying insects dropped by the US in the Northeast were probably produced in the germ factories in Canada. Because in that area, the weather is still very cold until June every year, and the climate conditions are suitable for cultivating cold-resistant bacteria and insects.

In answering a question about his impressions of this trip to China, he used his personal experience of living in our country for many years, compared the facts he saw today with the past, and praised the great achievements of the Chinese people and their strong will to fight against germ warfare. He said: I walked from East Germany to China, and the broad masses of people are eagerly demanding peace. In this region, all economic construction, culture and education are for the sake of peace. People demand peace, but at the same time, they are not afraid of war. The achievements of the Northeast people in the struggle against germ warfare are really admirable. In the shortest period of time, rural health work has been greatly improved on the basis of the past. The Chinese people are full of new spirit and new atmosphere in all aspects, and the people's political awareness has been greatly improved. Wen Youzhang gave the Chinese people's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements a very high evaluation, believing that this is the manifestation of the spirit of New China. With the power of a progressive New China, there is hope for peace in the Far East, and there is also hope for world peace. The Chinese people are standing on the front line of defending world peace, and your victory in the anti-germ warfare will encourage the people of the world to better defend and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.

Finally, Wen Youzhang introduced the situation of the Canadian people's peace movement to the reporters, and he said: After returning to China, I will announce the results of this investigation to the Canadian people and mobilize the Canadian people to rise up against the heinous germ warfare.

    文幼章在东北记者招待会上指出
    美国进行细菌战必然会遭到失败
    揭露加拿大反动派是美国进行细菌战的同谋犯
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】前来东北调查美帝国主义细菌战罪行的加拿大和平大会主席文幼章，十日下午三时举行记者招待会。出席记者招待会的有新华通讯社东北总分社、东北日报、劳动日报、东北青年报、沈阳日报、东北人民广播电台等单位的记者。文幼章就记者们所提出的问题作了答复。
    他首先说：我来到东北访问了卫生机关和各界人民，看到了美国政府进行细菌战的各项罪证，并进行实地调查后，证实了美国政府在中国领土上进行着大规模的细菌战争。尽管今天美国政府不敢承认，英国外交部也帮它辩护；可是，只要是公正而没有偏见的人，看了这些证据以后，是不能不加以承认的。他又说：美国进行细菌战必然失败，是由于它不明白新中国人民的力量，而过分地相信自己的“宣传”，它既不明白也不愿意明白新中国实在有办法、有力量的这一事实。我在实地调查中，亲眼看到乡村妇女在短期内学会了注射，人民都相信自己的力量能够打败美国的细菌战；同时，政府也是有能力的政府。美国的战争贩子和希特勒一样，只盲目地相信自己而不估计人民的力量，因此最后的失败是不可避免的。
    在回答关于对世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议“反对细菌战”告世界男女书的意见时，文幼章说：世界和平理事会是一个新的力量，是一个很大的力量，是保卫和平最可靠的武器。它过去既有力量发动亿万人民起来反对和制止原子能武器的使用，今天就更有力量制止反人道的细菌战争。和平运动的力量在一切国家里都是不可战胜的，在加拿大，情形也是这样：加拿大的第一次和平大会，参加的代表有三百七十多人，第二次是两千多人，第三次是三千二百人，拟在最近举行的和平大会，将有五千名代表出席。我们在最困难的情况下，已有三十多万人在拥护缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名。我相信，加拿大人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，一定都会坚决拥护奥斯陆会议的决议。
    文幼章在答复关于美国细菌战犯怎样进行细菌战争的准备工作一项问题时，揭发了加拿大的同谋犯是美国进行细菌战的帮凶。他说：据我所知道的，在加拿大阿尔伯特省的纳菲尔德地方，建立有大规模的细菌工厂，用人工培殖各种伤害人、畜和农作物的细菌昆虫。这个机构的主持人名叫索伦德，他曾经在美国“读者文摘”杂志上发表文章，竟公然说：将来大规模消灭人类的前途是光明的。可见这些家伙们是一点人道主义的精神也没有的。他指出：反动派知道自己的毁灭是不可避免的；因此，它们就产生一种毁灭主义的思想。希特勒是如此，美国反动派也是如此。在美国不少的地方，也有着上述同样的机构。我认为美国在东北所投掷的大量带菌昆虫，很可能就是在加拿大的细菌工厂里所生产的。因为在那个地区，每年到六月间天气还很冷，气候的条件适合于培殖耐寒的细菌昆虫。
    文幼章在答复关于此次访问中国之行的观感时，他以过去多年居于我国的亲身经历，用今天所看到的事实和往日对比，盛赞中国人民的伟大成就和反细菌战斗争的坚强意志。他说：我从东德走到中国，广大人民都热烈要求和平。在这个地区内，一切的经济建设、文化教育都是为了和平。人们要求和平，但同时，也并不害怕战争。东北人民在反细菌战的斗争中的成就，实在是令人敬佩的。在最短的期间内，农村卫生工作在过去的基础上又大大地提高了一步。中国人民在各方面都充满着新的精神和新的气象，人民的政治认识大大提高。文幼章对中国人民所进行的“三反”、“五反”运动，加以极崇高的评价，认为这就是新中国精神的表现。有了进步的新中国的力量，远东和平就有了希望，世界和平也有了希望。中国人民站在保卫世界和平的最前线，你们反细菌战的胜利，将鼓舞全世界的人民更好地保卫和巩固远东和全世界的和平。
    文幼章最后向记者们介绍了加拿大人民和平运动的情况，他表示：回国以后要将此次调查的结果向加拿大人民公布，动员加拿大人民起来反对罪恶的细菌战争。
