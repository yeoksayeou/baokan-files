    To the Editor: In some areas of Suqian County, Northern Jiangsu, large amounts of grain and money donated for airplanes and cannons are still overdue and have not been handed over. There have also been instances of embezzlement, spoilage, and corruption. Leading cadres in Suqian County once wrongly decided to use the excess donated funds to build a Martyrs' Tower, and it was only after correction from higher authorities that they decided to hand it over. In the Suwei District, besides the 14,463,800 yuan reminbi handed over on January 10th of this year, there are currently 40,778 jin of sorghum and 59,332,800 yuan reminbi remaining. In the Yangji District, over 2,000,000 yuan reminbi in donated funds has not been handed over. The 387,717,590 yuan reminbi in donated funds collected by the County Civil Affairs Section was also delayed for a period before being handed over to the Northern Jiangsu Anti-American Aid Korea Branch. Because of lax regulations, Wang Zonghua of the Civil Affairs Section embezzled 320,000 yuan last November by not recording the scattered donations he collected. The Suwei District only instructed the cooperatives to collect the donations, without inspection or supervision, resulting in spoilage of the grain stored in each cooperative. This was only discovered and reported on March 13th. When the Suwei Cooperative sent funds to the district, Instructor Zhang told them: "You can temporarily take it back to the cooperative to keep it for turnover!" Deputy District Chief Zhang once told the Luowei Cooperative to sell thousands of jin of donated grain to "stabilize market prices." These phenomena are intolerable, and the local leading authorities should promptly conduct a thorough investigation and deal with them. It is understood that other counties in Northern Jiangsu also have similar situations. Leading authorities in all regions should pay serious attention to this issue.

    苏北宿迁县应迅速检查积压飞机大炮捐款现象
    编辑同志：苏北宿迁县有的地方，至今还积压了大批飞机大炮捐献粮款没有上缴，并发生了挪用、霉烂和贪污现象。宿迁县领导干部曾错误地决定以捐献超额部分建造烈士塔，经上级纠正后才决定上缴。苏圩区全区捐献粮款除在今年一月十日上缴人民币一千四百四十六万三千八百元外，现尚存大秫四万零七百七十八斤，人民币五千九百三十三万二千八百元。杨集区也有捐献款二百多万元没有上缴。县民政科代收的捐献款三亿八千七百十七万五千九百元，也拖延了一个时期才上缴到苏北抗美援朝分会。因为制度不严，民政科王宗华在去年十一月份，未把分散缴来的捐献款入账，贪污了三十二万元。苏圩区对合作社只布置代收工作，没有检查督促，以致各社存粮均有霉烂现象，直到三月十三日才发现上报。苏圩合作社送款到区，张教导员却对他们说：“你们暂且带回社去留着周转吧！”张副区长曾叫罗圩合作社把捐献粮卖掉数千斤来“稳定市价”。这些现象是令人不能容忍的，当地领导机关应该迅速彻查处理。据了解，苏北其他县也有类似情况。各地领导机关应严重注意这个问题。吕善庭
