On "Undercurrents"
		Geng Da

    When some teachers in our universities made self-criticisms during the "Three-Anti" campaign, they often first recounted their well-known reactionary words and deeds before liberation, and then said that there was still an "undercurrent" in their thinking after liberation, which was the main reason why they did not do their work well.

    Is it just "not doing the work well"? This "undercurrent" is actually not very "under," and it constantly emerges and has objective effects. There are too many examples to cite: At the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, he worried that American weapons were very powerful; at first, he thought that land reform could be done with a single order, but after the nationwide land reform movement unfolded, he was always worried about cadres making "deviations"; after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign began, he felt that the treatment of counter-revolutionaries was too severe; at the beginning of the "Three-Anti" campaign, he said that there would be no corruption in our school, maybe a little waste, but not serious; as for bureaucracy, that was the business of the president and others. He thought everything was too "excessive" and didn't like to hear words like "vigorous" and "swift and decisive." He often used these "theories" in classrooms and in living rooms, spreading them everywhere. As for the courses he taught? There were even more tricks. Philosophy teachers said: To learn Marxism-Leninism, one must first understand all the theories before Marx; literature teachers wanted students to first learn "skills" from Western classical writers, and then learn politics in social life after graduation; economics teachers said: To learn Marxism-Leninism, one only needs to read "Das Kapital," because "there is only one Bible, but many preachers." Enough. Our universities are to cultivate a large number of young cadres with both moral character and talent, who are physically strong and have a high degree of political awareness, but some of our professors are educating young people in this way.

    Such remarks and such thoughts are the expression of the so-called "undercurrent." Calling it an "undercurrent" may even make him feel "wronged," because it is indeed different from his words and deeds before liberation, and some have also added the "wording" of Marxism-Leninism, but what is the essential difference? In reality, it is just that under the people's democratic regime, those things discarded by the masses are presented in a "disguised" posture; and where it is only an "undercurrent," it is simply a large amount of "smuggling."

    This is absolutely intolerable. Chairman Mao said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the "deepest recesses of the souls" of those intellectuals who have not been well reformed are "still a kingdom of the petty bourgeoisie," and they stubbornly demand to transform the world according to their own image, and if we follow them, "there is the danger of the Party, the country, and our heads being lost." The ideological problems of these teachers are much more serious than this. They still preserve the reactionary ideas of the British and American bourgeoisie intact, and they are not even in the "deepest recesses of the soul," but only under the clothes, only "under" to this extent, and they "reveal their true colors" as soon as they "take a bath"; full of "skin diseases," dirty and ugly, how can these things still be allowed to exist?

    In the process of our country's forward development, many old things will inevitably be continuously eliminated; because if they are not eliminated, they will hinder the emergence and development of fresh things. Therefore, the masses not only feel that people with such "undercurrents" are backward, but also feel that these people are simply "obstacles" to their progress. This is vividly demonstrated in the opinions put forward by the masses.

    Now the problem is very clear: how do these teachers want to treat their own "undercurrent"? Are they willing to preserve it and become a stumbling block for others and be thrown away? Or are they willing to honestly transform themselves with the thinking of the working class and strive to be a people's teacher?

    These teachers have always liked to take the so-called "middle road." If they think that the reality lessons are not enough, and only move that "undercurrent" from under their clothes to the "deepest recesses of the soul," then no problem can be solved; it will still become a stumbling block for others to move forward.

    Such an "undercurrent" cannot be allowed to "flow" down, nor can it be allowed to remain "under"; there is only one way: to expose it yourself, thoroughly criticize it, and earnestly reform yourself. Although this road is difficult, the future is very smooth and bright.

    说“暗流”
    耿达
    我们高等学校的某些教师在“三反”运动中做检讨时，常常先说了他在解放以前的一些为人所知的反动言行后，就说他在解放以后思想上还有一股“暗流”，这是他工作做不好的主要原因。
    岂只“工作做不好”？这“暗流”其实是并不很“暗”的，它是不时地要冒出来并发生客观影响的。要举例实在也多得很：抗美援朝运动初起时，他就担忧美国的武器很厉害；起先他以为土地改革是可以用一纸命令办好的，到全国土地改革运动展开以后，他老担心的是干部出“偏差”；镇压反革命运动展开后，他觉得对待反革命分子太严厉了；“三反”运动初起时，他说我们学校里不会有贪污，浪费可能有一点，也不严重；至于官僚主义，那是校长他们的事情。他对于什么事都以为太“过火”了，很不喜欢听“大张旗鼓”、“雷厉风行”这些字眼。他经常拿上这些“理论”在课堂上、在客厅里，到处传播。至于他教的课呢？那花样就更多了。教哲学的说：要学马列主义必须首先搞通马克思以前的各种学说；教文学的要让同学先向西欧古典作家学好“技巧”，毕业后再在社会生活里学习政治；教经济学的说：要学马列主义只需看“资本论”就行了，因为“圣经只有一本，传教师却多得很”。够了，我们的高等学校是要培养出大批的德才兼备、体魄健全、具有高度政治觉悟的青年干部来的，而我们的某些教授却是这样地教育青年。
    这样的言论和这样的思想就是所谓“暗流”的表现。说是“暗流”，在他也许还觉得是受了“委屈”的；因为这的确和他在解放以前的言行有所不同了，有些也加上马克思列宁主义的“字样”了，但本质上又有什么差别呢？实际上不过是在人民民主政权下面，又把那套为群众所唾弃的东西又以“乔装”的姿态摆出来罢了；而且那里只是一股“暗流”，简直是大量的“走私”。
    这是绝不能容忍的事情。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中说那些没有经过很好改造的知识分子的“灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级的王国”，他们顽强地要求依照他们的面貌来改造世界，而如果依了他们，“就有亡党亡国亡头的危险”。我们这些教师的思想问题比这要严重得多，他们还原封未动地保存着英美资产阶级的反动思想，而且也并不在“灵魂深处”，就仅仅在衣服的下边，仅仅“暗”到这种程度，一“洗澡”就“原形毕露”了；满身的“皮肤病”，肮脏、丑恶，这些东西怎么可以还让它存在呢？
    在我们国家向前发展的过程中，是必然会有许多的旧东西要不断消灭的；因为如果不让它消灭，它就会妨碍新鲜事物的产生和发展。因此，群众不仅感到有这样“暗流”的人是落后的，而且感觉到这些人简直就是他们向前进步的“障碍”。这在群众所提的意见中是生动地证明了的。
    现在问题很显明了，这些教师究竟愿意怎样来对待自己的这股“暗流”呢？是愿意把它保存下来使自己变成别人的绊脚石而让人扔开呢？还是老老实实地以工人阶级的思想来改造自己，来争取做一个人民教师呢？
    这些教师一向是喜欢走所谓“中间路线”的，如果认为现实教训还不够，而只把那股“暗流”从衣服下面移到“灵魂深处”，那是什么问题也不能解决的；那仍然是要变成别人前进的绊脚石的。
    这样的“暗流”是既不能让它“流”下去，也决不能让它“暗”下去的；只有自己把它暴露出来，彻底批判，认真改造自己的一条道路。这条路虽然是艰苦的，但前途却是非常平坦和光明的。
