Today, people in many countries around the world are suffering from problems such as unemployment, reduced real wages, and deteriorating living conditions. These problems have become a concern for the vast majority of people worldwide. There are many reasons for these problems, but one of the important reasons is that normal international trade relations have been disrupted by the policies of war preparation, blockade, and embargo, making it impossible for civilian industries in many countries to operate or produce at full capacity due to the lack of necessary raw materials and product sales markets, causing many workers to lose their jobs, real wages to decrease, and living conditions to deteriorate. At the same time, some other countries are experiencing great economic difficulties because they cannot sell the raw materials they produce or cannot buy the industrial products and food they need. Many of you here have witnessed and experienced this disaster firsthand and know it very well, so I don’t need to say much more about it.

I would like to briefly introduce to you the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of workers' and farmers' lives over the past two years, as well as the favorable conditions created thereby for promoting international trade.

In the past, China's industrial and agricultural production suffered serious damage in the long-term wars created by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries: more than half of the railways and highways were damaged, agricultural production was reduced to 75 percent of pre-war levels, heavy industry output was only 30 percent of the highest year in Chinese history, and light industry output was only 70 percent. The lives of workers and farmers were extremely miserable. Due to the impact of production decline, the total value of international trade in 1948 had fallen to 28 percent of that in 1931. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's industrial and agricultural production rapidly recovered and developed. By 1951, the level of China's industrial and agricultural production had approached, and in some cases greatly exceeded, the highest annual output in Chinese history.

In terms of restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, Chinese workers and farmers have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. More than 80 percent of Chinese workers participated in patriotic labor competitions, put forward 147,67 rationalization proposals for parts production, and produced 86,541 labor models. The improvement of labor productivity of Chinese workers has created a large amount of wealth for the country. In the Northeast region alone, the staff and workers of state-owned factories created an additional profit of 14 million tons of grain beyond the original production plan in 1951, which could be used to build fifty spinning mills with 50,000 spindles. If all the equipment for these spindles were ordered from abroad, it would guarantee that a large number of workers manufacturing spinning machines abroad would not become unemployed.

The liberated Chinese farmers have participated in agricultural labor mutual aid organizations and improved agricultural production technology, thus greatly increasing the yield per unit area of agricultural production. China has now changed from a country that has historically imported grain to a country that can be self-sufficient in grain. If Chinese farmers produce 5 kilograms more grain per mu per year, they can produce 7.5 million tons more grain per year. This grain can feed 25 million people for a year.

China has 80 million farming households, each of which has the habit of raising chickens and pigs. If each household raises one more chicken and one more pig, it can increase the production of 10 billion eggs and 6 million tons of pork per year. If these increased, inexpensive, and high-quality eggs and pork are exchanged for industrial products from other countries, the supply problem of eggs and pork in some countries can be greatly improved.

China's land reform can be basically completed in 1952. Chinese farmers can use the 30 million tons of grain they used to pay as rent to purchase a large number of industrial products such as cloth, white sugar, Western medicine, new agricultural implements, and chemical fertilizers. From the autumn of 1950 to the summer of 1951, the income from the sale of farmers' local products and handicrafts through China's cooperatives and public-private trading organizations increased by about 25 million tons of grain. This has greatly increased the purchasing power of farmers. The purchasing power of farmers in the Northeast region increased by an average of 53.5 percent in 1951 compared to 1950, 63 percent in Zhejiang Province, and 50 percent in Shandong Province. Looking at the amount of cloth purchased, the average person in the Northeast region purchased 4 square meters in 1949, 9 square meters in 1950, and 13.3 square meters in 1951. If each person in China wears an average of 2 square meters more cloth per year, then 1 billion square meters more cloth will be worn per year.

On the basis of the rapid restoration and development of industry and agriculture, China's unemployment problem has been basically solved. There is already a shortage of intellectuals and skilled workers, and it is necessary to train them quickly and in large numbers. In terms of primary school teachers alone, we need to supplement 1 million new primary school teachers from this year to 1956, otherwise we will not be able to meet the requirements of national education development.

Due to the rapid increase in workers' real wages (the real wages in the Northeast region in 1951 were 260 percent of those in March 1948), the living standards of workers have greatly improved. Here I would like to give an example of the No. 2 State-owned Textile Factory in Tianjin to illustrate this. The nutritional level stipulated by the factory's workers' canteen for each person per day is: 373 grams of rice, 373 grams of white flour, 127.5 grams of meat, 597 grams of vegetables including eggs and tofu, 19 grams of oil, and 19 grams of salt. The cost of this nutritional level accounts for about 20 percent of the average wage of the factory's workers. The fine spinning workshop of the above-mentioned yarn factory has a total of 340 workers. In the past two years, 110 people have bought watches, 140 people have bought fountain pens, 15 people have bought bicycles, 300 people bought leather warm shoes in the winter of 1950, 30 percent of the workers have savings in the bank, and more than 95 percent of the workers watch movies at least once a week.

Seventy to eighty percent of the farmers in China's old liberated areas are living a well-off middle peasant life without worrying about food and clothing. According to the survey materials of Shandong Province, which has a moderate level of wealth in farmers' lives in 1951, the average income of each farmer, excluding living expenses, production investment, taxes and other expenses, has an average surplus of 51,000 yuan RMB. Calculated according to this standard, the surplus funds of farmers nationwide in 1951 amounted to more than 20 trillion RMB. If this surplus is used to purchase waterwheels for irrigating fields from abroad, 10 million units can be purchased.

The health care conditions of the Chinese people have been greatly improved. All factories and mining enterprises with more than 100 employees have fully implemented labor insurance, properly solving the special difficulties of workers in terms of birth, old age, illness, death, and disability. At present, more than 10 million workers nationwide, including their families, are enjoying labor insurance benefits. All labor insurance funds are paid by the enterprise administration or the capitalists. In order to prevent the epidemic of smallpox, 200 million people have been vaccinated against smallpox in the past two years. In cities such as Beijing, Dalian, and Guangzhou, no smallpox patients have been found in the past year and a half. Due to our cholera prevention injections, we have not found the epidemic of cholera in the past two years. For this reason, we also need to import a large number of medicines and various sanitary equipment to meet the needs of the current development of health care.

The cultural life of workers and farmers has also been greatly improved. A total of 2.02 million employees nationwide have participated in amateur cultural learning, and more than 25 million farmers have participated in winter schools. Workers' cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, and farmers' amateur troupes have been widely established throughout the country. Therefore, the need for various cultural products has greatly increased. If each person in China uses 15 more newspapers per year, an additional 250,000 tons of newspapers will be needed per year.

In short, in a country with nearly 500 million people, the development of industry and agriculture, the increase in people's purchasing power, and the improvement of people's living conditions will undoubtedly create unprecedented favorable conditions for promoting international trade and developing international economic relations, such as the export of agricultural products, livestock products, and mineral products, and the import of industrial, agricultural, and transportation machinery, equipment, raw materials, industrial products, and chemicals, etc. Taking 1951 as an example, the total value of China's international trade in this year increased by one time compared with 1950, which has far exceeded the pre-war years! There will naturally be new developments in 1952.

The foreign trade policy of the People's Republic of China is clearly stipulated in the Common Program that it will restore and develop commercial and trade relations with various foreign governments and people on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In the past two years, under the guidance of the above-mentioned foreign trade policy, our trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has achieved great success. We very much hope that through this International Economic Conference, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we will break the blockade and embargo, break the artificial restrictions newly created for promoting international trade, implement peaceful cooperation between countries with different political systems and socio-economic systems and people with various different views and beliefs, and seek a possible way for mankind in the world to promote trade and other economic relations between countries under the conditions of world peace to improve people's living conditions. Judging from the progress of this International Economic Conference in the past few days, this possibility is extremely great. If this possibility is turned into reality, then this International Economic Conference will make a great contribution to consolidating lasting world peace. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow)

    四月七日在国际经济会议第二小组会上
    我国代表团团员刘子久的发言
    今天，世界上有许多国家的人民，都为失业、实际工资降低、生活恶化等问题所苦恼着。这些问题已成为当前全世界绝大多数人所关心的问题。造成这些问题的原因很多，但重要的原因之一，就是正常的国际贸易关系被备战、封锁、禁运政策所破坏，使许多国家的民用工业，因为缺乏必要的原料与产品的销售市场，不得不停工减产，使许多工人失业，实际工资减少，生活恶化。同时，另外的一些国家，因为生产的原料卖不出去，或者买不到所需要的工业品与粮食，而感受到很大的经济困难。这种灾难，在座的诸位先生有许多是目睹身受，知道的很清楚，用不着我多讲。
    我想在这里，把两年来中国工业农业生产的发展和工人农民生活的改善，及由此为推广国际贸易所造成的有利条件，简单地向诸位先生介绍一下。
    过去，中国工业农业的生产，在日本帝国主义与国民党反动派所制造的长期战争中，曾遭受了严重的破坏：铁路和公路被损坏达一半以上，农业生产减少至战前的百分之七十五，重工业产量只相当于中国历史上最高一年的百分之三十，轻工业的产量只相当于百分之七十。工人和农民的生活陷于极悲惨的境地。由于生产衰退的影响，国际贸易的总值，
    一九四八年曾经降低到一九三一年的百分之二十八。中华人民共和国成立后，中国的工业和农业生产迅速的恢复并发展起来，到一九五一年，中国的工业与农业生产的水平，都已接近、有些已大大地超过了中国历史上最高的年产量。
    在恢复和发展工业农业生产方面，中国工人与农民发挥了高度的劳动热情与劳动创造性。中国工人百分之八十以上参加了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，提出了一四七、六七零件生产合理化建议，涌现出了八六、五四一位劳动模范，中国工人劳动生产率的提高，为国家创造了大量的财富。单东北一个地区，国营工厂的职工，在一九五一年除了完成原定的生产计划之外，还给国家创造了价值一千四百万吨粮食的超额计划利润，可以修建五十个五万纱锭的纺纱厂。如果这些纱锭的全部设备都是从国外订购的话，就可以保证国外大批制造纺纱机器的工人不致失业。
    解放了的中国农民，很多参加了农业劳动互助组织，改进了农业生产技术，因而农业生产的单位面积产量就大为提高。现在中国已由历年粮食进口的国家，变为粮食能够自给的国家了。如果中国农民每亩地每年多生产五公斤粮食，则每年就可以多生产七百五十万吨粮食。这些粮食可供给两千五百万人一年食用。
    中国有八千万农户，家家都有养鸡养猪的习惯。每家农户多养一只鸡和一口猪，每年可增产一百亿个鸡蛋，六百万吨猪肉。如果以这些增产的价廉物美的鸡蛋和猪肉交换其他国家的工业品，就可以大大地改善某些国家的鸡蛋与猪肉的供应问题。
    中国的土地改革，于一九五二年可以基本上完成，中国农民可以拿他们过去交纳地租的三千万吨粮食去大量购买布匹、白糖、西药、新式农具、化学肥料等工业品。从一九五零年秋到一九五一年夏，经过中国的合作社及公私贸易机关所推销的农民的土产及手工业品增加的收入，约合二千五百万吨粮食。这样就大大地提高了农民的购买力。东北农民的购买力，一九五一年比一九五零年平均提高了百分之五十三点五，浙江省提高了百分之六十三，山东省提高了百分之五十。以布的购买量来看，东北地区一九四九年平均每人购买四平方米，一九五零年为九平方米，一九五一年为十三点三平方米。如果中国每人每年平均多穿两平方米布，则每年可多穿十亿平方米布。
    在工农业迅速恢复与发展的基础上，中国工人的失业问题已经基本解决，知识分子和熟练工人已经感到缺乏，需要迅速大量的培养，单就小学教师一项来说，从今年到一九五六年，我们需要补充一百万新的小学教师，不然我们就不能满足全国教育发展的要求。
    由于工人的实际工资迅速增加（东北地区的实际工资，一九五一年为一九四八年三月份的百分之二百六十），工人生活的水平，是大为提高了。在这里我想举天津国营第二纺织厂的实例来加以说明。该厂工人食堂所规定的每人每天的营养水平是：大米三七三公分，白面三七三公分，肉一二七点五公分，蔬菜包括鸡蛋、豆腐等五九七公分，油一九公分，盐一九公分。这种营养水平的费用，约占该厂工人平均工资的百分之二十。上述纱厂的细纱车间共有三四零个工人，两年来，有一百一十人买了手表，一百四十人买了自来水笔，十五人买了脚踏车，在一九五零年冬季有三百人买了皮暖鞋，百分之三十的工人在银行有储蓄，百分之九十五以上的工人每星期至少要看一次电影。
    中国老解放区的农民，已有百分之七十到八十过着不愁吃不愁穿的中农生活。根据一九五一年农民生活中等富裕程度的山东省的调查材料来看，每个农民的收入，除了生活费用、生产投资、纳税及其他支出外，平均每人剩余五万一千元人民币。以这个标准来计算，一九五一年，全国农民的余款有二十多万亿人民币。如果以这笔余款，从国外购买农民灌田的水车就可以买入一千万架。
    中国人民的卫生保健条件是大大地改善了。现在一百职工以上的工厂、矿山企业，已全部实行了劳动保险，适当地解决了工人群众的生、老、病、死、残等特殊困难问题。现在全国享受劳动保险待遇工人，连家属在内，已达一千万人以上。劳动保险金全部由企业行政方面或资方支付。为了预防天花的流行，两年来，有两亿人种了牛痘。在北京、旅大、广州等城市，一年半以来未发现过天花病人。由于我们进行了霍乱预防注射，两年来我们没有发现霍乱病的流行。为此，我们还需要进口大批的药品及各种卫生器材，以满足当前卫生事业发展的需要。
    工人和农民的文化生活也大为改善，全国参加业余文化学习的职工已有二百零二万人；参加冬学的农民已有二千五百多万人。工人的文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆和农民的业余剧团，已在全国范围内广泛地建立起来。因此对于各种文化用品的需要就大为增加。如果中国人每人每年多用十五张报纸，每年就需要增加二十五万吨报纸。
    总而言之，在一个拥有近五万万人口的国家中，工业农业的发展，人民购买力的提高，和人民生活条件的改善，无疑问地，将为推广国际贸易，发展国际经济关系，如农业产品畜产品矿产品的输出及工业农业和交通的机器、器材、原料、工业用品及化学品等的输入等等，创造空前未有的有利条件。即以一九五一年来说，这一年中国的国际贸易总值就比一九五零年增加了一倍，已经远超过了战前的年代！一九五二年自然还会有新的发展。
    中华人民共和国的对外贸易政策，在共同纲领中已明确规定：在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系。两年来，在上述这种对外贸易政策的指导下，我们与苏联及其他人民民主的国家的贸易已经获得了很大成就。我们很希望，通过这次国际经济会议，在平等互利的基础上，打破封锁禁运，打破对于推广国际贸易新造成的人为的限制，在各个不同的政治制度与社会经济制度的国家间和抱有各种不同的观点与信仰的人们间，实行和平合作，为世界人类寻求出一个在世界和平条件下推广各国间贸易及其他经济关系以改善人民生活条件的可能途径。从这几天国际经济会议进展的情况看来，这种可能是极大的，如果把这种可能性变为现实，则这次国际经济会议对于巩固世界持久和平将有极大的供献。（新华社莫斯科讯）
