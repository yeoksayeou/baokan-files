    The Educational Work of the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Shi Ying
    The Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative of Wangjiazhuang, Fifth District, Licheng County, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, was established in April last year. The cooperative has a total of twenty-three households, forty-two male and female members, one hundred and eighty-seven mu of land, and eighteen livestock. Last year, due to the implementation of land and labor as shares, collective labor was carried out under unified leadership and unified planning. In particular, due to the strengthening of political, technical, and cultural education, the labor enthusiasm and creativity of all members were highly developed. Under the slogan of patriotic increase in production, the annual agricultural and sideline production reached two hundred and eighty-six shi, exceeding the output of any previous year.
    In order to study the farmers' spare-time education work in agricultural production cooperatives, we conducted a survey of the cooperative in January this year. Because agricultural production cooperatives are an advanced collective production mutual aid organization, with the strong leadership of the Party and the leadership of backbone activists, they have a strong organization and are convenient for unified leadership. The consistency of time is used to organize members to carry out collective learning. In particular, due to frequent collective labor and the implementation of land shares, the interests of the cooperative and the interests of individuals are consistent, which is more conducive to transforming farmers' ideology. At the same time, due to the development of production within the cooperative and the improvement of members' political awareness, members have a very high enthusiasm for political, technical, and cultural learning.
    Political Education
    In order to strengthen members' education in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and patriotism, correcting members' labor attitude, thereby improving members' political awareness, establishing collectivist thinking, and ensuring the completion of production increase tasks, the cooperative has paid close attention to the political education of its members. Political learning is personally led by the cooperative director Dong Taoqi (secretary of the Party branch). (Dong Taoqi also serves as the political teacher of the people's school and participates in the political instruction work in the district.) In the past year, the cooperative has carried out political and ideological education for its members in various ways according to the members' thinking.
    The deputy leaders of each production team are responsible for leading the learning. The cooperative has a total of five newspaper reading groups and forty-two members. Each production team has a newspaper reader. There are four newspapers, four current affairs handbooks and propaganda handbooks each, and two Shanxi Pictorials. There are also six propagandists in the cooperative, accounting for one-third of the propagandists in the village. Learning current affairs has become an indispensable part of the political life of the members. Every day when they go to the fields to work, they always bring newspapers and use their rest time to explain current affairs to everyone. In summer, because the weather was continuously cloudy, everyone felt very bored when the newspapers did not come for a few days. Learning from newspapers not only enhanced the patriotic thinking of the members, but also enabled them to learn advanced agricultural production experience. For example, after learning the deeds of labor model and patriotic model Li Shunda, everyone overcame the tendency of burying themselves in production and not asking about politics; at the same time, they also learned Li Shunda's advanced production technology and revised the cooperative's patriotic production increase plan. In this way, personal interests and national interests are closely combined.
    In order to overcome the selfishness of small-scale peasant producers, the cooperative has continuously carried out education on the subordination of personal interests to the interests of the entire cooperative and even the interests of the country. And in order to enhance the confidence of the members and strengthen their determination to participate in agricultural production cooperatives for a long time, education on the socialist future was also carried out. For example, at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, it was discovered that some members had selfish thoughts such as "keeping the good land for themselves and joining the cooperative with the bad land" and "applying good manure to their own land and sending bad manure to the cooperative land." Later, after continuous education, the members' thinking gradually changed. Member Yue Zhicun said well: "The cooperative is our home. If the cooperative land is not well cultivated, everyone will suffer." In the past, many members had doubts about the development prospects of the cooperative. The director and labor model Dong Taoqi conducted extensive publicity among the masses, enabling everyone to understand the vision of our great motherland, greatly enhancing the production and construction confidence of the members. At the same time, education on the socialist future was carried out to the members, making them more clearly aware that: "This is the road we are going to take." It strengthened the confidence in participating in agricultural production cooperatives and moving towards socialist agricultural collectivization.
    In order to correct the labor attitude of the members and cultivate the habit of consciously abiding by labor discipline, the cooperative held life review meetings in groups on time. At first, everyone was embarrassed to talk about anyone at the meeting, and criticism and self-criticism could not be carried out. In order to overcome this phenomenon, in addition to conducting education on criticism and self-criticism, an opinion box and a merit record table were established to promote advantages and criticize shortcomings. Later, the members' awareness improved, and the opinion box was canceled according to everyone's opinions (the merit record table was still retained). Now, everyone actively participates in production and consciously abides by labor discipline.
    The director and team leaders also paid attention to regularly conducting individual talks with members, collecting everyone's opinions, absorbing rationalization proposals, and focusing on understanding the members' ideological situation and conducting individual education. For example, member Fan Enquan was not energetic in farming for the military dependents and said some idle words: "He joined the army because he wanted to go, I didn't let him go; why should I cultivate the land for him for free!" Director Dong Taoqi used the story of the heroic battles of the People's Volunteer Army to defend the security of the motherland to educate him, explaining that farming for the military dependents is the obligation that the people should fulfill. Finally, he changed his attitude and expressed his willingness to cultivate the land for the military dependents well.
    Technical Education
    In order to improve the agricultural production technology of the members and achieve the goal of increasing the yield per unit area, so as to complete the cooperative's patriotic production increase plan, the cooperative carried out technical education for the members through various practical production activities according to the production season. And invited Guo Huze, a technician from the Changzhi Prefecture Farm, to be stationed in the cooperative for a long time, and jointly with Dong Taoqi to be responsible for leading the members' technical learning; three technicians went to the production teams to conduct specific guidance. A technical research committee was also organized to hold regular meetings to specifically study agricultural production technology and solve difficulties in production.
    When sending manure before spring plowing, different base fertilizers were sent according to different lands. For example, pig manure and smoked manure were applied to slope land. Sheep manure and pen manure were applied to shady land. And these scientific principles were combined with the experience of the old farmers to carry out education. The members said: "We used to apply manure like this in previous years, but we didn't know what was going on; now we understand it."
    In order to select excellent varieties, a small farm was also established to illustrate the importance of selecting excellent varieties with facts. In addition, a small nursery was also established, with more than 1,000 walnut, peach, apricot, prickly ash and other trees planted to develop forestry production, and the members were told why to cultivate forests and the methods of planting trees.
    In the past, warm soup soaking was used to plant seeds, but last year, under the guidance of farm technician Guo Huze, the method of seed dressing with medicine was adopted. The conservative thinking of the members was overcome, and the thinking of constantly learning, researching, and improving technology was established.
    Cultural Education
    The cooperative also attaches great importance to the cultural learning of the members, and is now preparing to eliminate illiteracy in the entire cooperative within two years. This work is led by Deputy Director Fan Enming, who specifically helps everyone learn.
    Last year, the cooperative members' cultural learning achieved significant results: the original thirty-four illiterate people have been reduced to twenty-seven; the members with a primary school education have increased from one to three; the original two members with a higher primary school education have been raised to the level of higher primary school graduation.
    The entire cooperative conducts cultural learning in units of the original three male production teams and two female production teams (led by the deputy team leaders). Every ten days, Deputy Director Fan Enming convenes the team leaders to hold meetings for teaching and inspection. A cultural learning campaign was launched last year to promote the mutual learning method of members teaching members. At the end of the year, a member learning achievement exhibition was also held, which greatly promoted the members' learning. Parents said: "Joining the cooperative not only allows us to cultivate the land well, but also allows us to learn culture well."
    For usual homework, first graders are required to write a large character every day, second graders are required to write a small character every day, third graders are required to write a diary every day, and fourth graders are required to write a composition every week. A test is also conducted every month.
    After the people's school had its winter vacation, the cooperative specifically arranged the members' vacation learning, and determined the learning progress and requirements according to different objects.
    In order to carry out this work, 10% of the cooperative's public accumulation fund is allocated as education expenses. All textbooks and stationery for all members and members' children are completely supplied by the cooperative; newspapers, pictorials, etc. are also paid from the education expenses.

    董桃气农业生产合作社的教育工作
    石瑛
    山西省长治专区黎城县第五区王家庄的董桃气农业生产合作社，是在去年四月成立的。全社共有二十三户，男女社员四十二人，社地一百八十七亩、牲畜十八头。去年由于实行了土地和劳力入股，在统一领导和统一计划下，进行集体劳动，特别是由于加强了政治、技术和文化教育，因而高度地发挥了全体社员的劳动积极性和创造性，在爱国增产的口号下，全年农业、副业的生产量达二百八十六石，超过了已往任何一年的产量。
    我们为了研究农业生产合作社的农民业余教育工作，曾于今年一月间对该社进行了调查。由于农业生产合作社是一种先进的集体生产的互助组织，有党的坚强领导，有骨干积极分子的带头，所以组织性较强，便于统一领导、利用时间的一致组织社员进行集体学习。特别是由于经常进行集体劳动，实行了土地入股，社的利益和个人利益的一致，更便于改造农民的思想意识。同时由于社内生产的发展和社员政治觉悟的提高，社员的政治、技术和文化学习的情绪都非常高。
    政治教育
    为了加强社员的抗美援朝、增产节约和爱国主义的教育，端正社员的劳动态度，从而提高社员的政治觉悟，树立集体主义的思想，保证增产任务的完成，该社对于社员的政治教育抓得很紧。政治学习由社长董桃气（党组织的支部书记）亲自负责领导。（董桃气并兼任民校的政治教员，参加区里的政治传授工作。）过去一年来，该社根据社员的思想，采取各种各样的方式对社员进行了政治、思想教育。
    每个生产小组的副组长都负责领导学习。全社共有五个读报组、四十二个组员，每个生产组都有一个读报员。共订有报纸四份、时事手册和宣传手册各四份，山西画报两份。社内还有宣传员六人，占全村宣传员的三分之一。学习时事已成为社员不可缺少的政治生活，每天上地劳动时，他们总要带上报纸，利用休息时间由读报组给大家讲解时事。夏季，因为天气连阴，报纸几天没有来，大家就觉得很闷。学习报纸，不仅使社员们增强了爱国主义的思想，而且还使他们学到了先进的农业生产经验。如学习了劳动模范、爱国模范李顺达的事迹以后，大家就克服了埋头生产、不问政治的偏向；同时又学习了李顺达的先进生产技术，修订了全社的爱国增产计划。这样，个人利益和国家利益密切地结合起来了。
    为了克服农民小生产者的自私性，社内曾不断地进行了个人利益服从全社利益以至国家利益的教育。并且为了提高社员的信心，坚定其长期参加农业生产合作社的决心，还进行了社会主义前途的教育。如初建社时，发现部分社员“好地自留，坏地入社”、“好粪上自留地、坏粪送社地”的自私思想，后来经过不断的教育，社员的思想才渐有改变。社员岳之存说得好：“社就是咱的家，社地种不好，大家都要吃亏。”过去有不少社员对社的发展前途一直存在着怀疑，社长、劳动模范董桃气就在群众中进行了广泛的宣传，使大家认识到我们伟大祖国的远景，大大地提高了社员的生产建设信心。同时，又向社员进行了社会主义前途的教育，使他们更明确地认识到：“这就是咱们要走的道路。”坚定了参加农业生产合作社和走向社会主义农业集体化的信心。
    为了端正社员的劳动态度，养成自觉遵守劳动纪律的习惯，社内按时分小组召开了生活检讨会。起初，大家在会上谁也不好意思说谁，批评和自我批评开展不起来。为了克服这种现象，除向大家进行了关于批评和自我批评的教育外，并建立了意见箱和记功表，以发扬优点，批评缺点。后来，社员的觉悟提高，根据大家的意见取消了意见箱（记功表还是保留着）。现在，大家都积极参加生产，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。
    社长和组长还注意了经常和社员进行个别谈话，搜集大家的意见，吸取合理化建议，并着重了解社员的思想情况，个别进行教育。如社员范恩铨给军属代耕不起劲，并且说些闲话：“他参军是他自己要去的，我又没让他去；为啥让我给他白种地！”社长董桃气就用人民志愿军英勇战斗保卫祖国安全的故事教育他，说明代耕是人民应尽的义务。最后他改变了态度，表示愿意把军属的土地代耕好。
    技术教育
    为了提高社员的农业生产技术，达到提高单位面积产量的目的，以完成全社爱国增产计划，社内根据生产季节，通过各种实际的生产活动，向社员进行了技术教育。并请长治专区农场技师郭虎则长期驻社，和董桃气共同负责领导社员的技术学习；三个技术员分别到生产小组进行具体辅导。并组织技术研究委员会，定期召开会议，专门研究农业生产技术和解决生产中的困难。
    春耕前送粪时，根据不同的地送了不同的底肥。如坡地上了猪肥和熏肥。背阴地上了羊粪和圈肥。并把这些科学道理和老农的经验结合起来，进行了教育。社员说：“往年也是这样上粪，就是不知道是怎么回事；现在可摸底了。”
    为了选择优良品种，还建立了一个小型的农场，用事实来说明选择优良品种的重要性。另外还设立了一个小小的苗圃，种有一千多株核桃、桃、杏、花椒等树，准备发展林业生产，并告诉社员为什么要育林和植树的方法。
    往年都是用温汤浸种，去年经农场技师郭虎则的指导，采用了药剂拌种的方法。克服了社员的保守思想，树立了不断虚心学习、钻研和改进技术的思想。
    文化教育
    社内对于社员的文化学习也很重视，现正准备在二年内扫除全社的文盲。这一工作由副社长范恩铭负责领导，具体帮助大家学习。
    去年该社社员的文化学习有显著的成绩：原有文盲三十四人，现减少为二十七人；初小程度的社员原来只有一人，现增加到三人；高小程度的原来有二人，现均提高到高小毕业程度。
    全社按原有的三个男生产小组和两个女生产小组为单位进行文化学习（由副组长负责领导）。每十天由副社长范恩铭召集各小组长开会进行传授和检查。去年曾开展过一次文化学习运动，提倡社员教社员的互助学习方法。年底还举行了社员学习成绩展览会，大大地推动了社员的学习。家长们说：“入了社不但地种得好，还能学好文化。”
    平时的课外作业，要求一年级每天写大字一篇，二年级每天写小字一篇，三年级每天写日记一篇，四年级每周作文一篇。每月还进行一次测验。
    民校放寒假后，社内又具体布置了社员的假期学习，并根据不同的对象，确定了学习进度和要求。
    为了开展这一工作，由社内公积金中拨出百分之十作为教育费。所有社员和社员子弟的课本、文具完全由社方供给；报纸、画刊等也由教育费内开支。
