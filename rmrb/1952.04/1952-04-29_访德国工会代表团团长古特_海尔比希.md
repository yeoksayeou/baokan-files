Interview with Gute Heirbich, Head of the German Trade Union Delegation

The working class of the German Democratic Republic regards sending a delegation to our country to participate in the "May Day" celebrations as a major event. Gute Heirbich, head of the German Trade Union Delegation invited to our country to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, said: "When we departed from our country, many workers saw us off along the way. They told us: Be sure to bring the warm feelings of the German people to China."

Gute Heirbich's conversation with the reporter covered many aspects. Obviously, he wanted to take this opportunity to talk about many things that the Chinese people are concerned about. He first introduced the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in production and construction, and the situation of the German people's movement to defend world peace. He said: Although the aggressive war launched by Hitler left the German people with serious disasters, and American imperialism tore Germany in half, creating many new difficulties for Germany's economic construction; however, the German working class, uniting the people of the whole country, relying on the sincere and selfless assistance of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, completed the two-year production plan three months ahead of schedule in September 1950, restoring the industrial production level of 1936. The German people then began a greater task – the new five-year production plan. He said: After the completion of the five-year plan, the national production volume will be doubled compared to the production volume in 1950. The output of steel and iron will be quadrupled; 240,000 residential buildings and 10 million square meters of workers' housing will be built; and cities destroyed in the war will be rebuilt.

He said: The booming production and construction have brought unprecedented happiness to German workers. State-run department stores have continuously reduced prices fourteen times, while workers' wages have increased year by year; most factories have nurseries and kindergartens; there are more than 400 cultural palaces across the country; in scenic areas, trade unions have set up many sanatoriums for employees. This summer, 500,000 workers across the country will go to sanatoriums for recuperation (the total number of workers in the German Democratic Republic is about 6 million). In the German Democratic Republic, a pound of bread costs 18 pfennigs (100 pfennigs are one mark), 100 grams of sausage costs more than 30 pfennigs, a high-quality suit costs 110 marks, and a radio costs 200 to 300 marks. However, an ordinary steelworker can earn 360 to 380 marks per month, and a skilled worker can earn 500 to 700 marks, or even more. Therefore, every German worker can live a prosperous life.

Gute Heirbich emphasized that the speed of production and construction in the German Democratic Republic has never been seen before, because the German people fully understand that actively engaging in production and construction is a great contribution to world peace.

Gute Heirbich briefly introduced the heroic struggle of the West German working class against the American oppressors: The American government attempted to conclude a treaty with Adenauer to divide Germany and serve the aggressive war. The right-wing trade union leaders of West Germany, Peet and Fimhof, expressed their acceptance of this war pact. As soon as this news came out, workers in various cities in West Germany immediately launched a storm of protests, and workers in many factories held warning strikes. Once, Munich held a representative conference of the Bavarian Provincial Trade Union, with representatives representing 900,000 trade union members. As soon as Peet and Fimhof put forward their absurd opinions at the meeting, they were immediately severely reprimanded by the representatives. Under the pressure of the angry masses, Peet and Fimhof had to leave the venue quietly. From this example, we can see the new upsurge of the West German people's movement against division, striving for national reunification, and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty in accordance with the conditions proposed by the Soviet government, as well as their powerful strength in defending peace.

Gute Heirbich talked about his impressions after arriving in Beijing. He said: "Although I have only visited Tsinghua University and the Girls' Middle School affiliated to Beijing Normal University, I have already seen the happiness and joy of Chinese youth from the students of these two schools. They can not only learn scientific knowledge, but also actively participate in various political activities. We saw many new buildings in Beijing, and a new Beijing is growing up." He talked about the scene before they left Germany: "Every comrade in the delegation regards participating in the first German trade union delegation to China as their greatest honor. Many comrades are envious of us. When the news that Labor Hero Paul Lutsman was coming to China reached the steel factory where he worked, more than 3,000 workers in the entire factory congratulated him on having such great happiness."

Finally, Gute Heirbich said: "We hope that through our work, the friendship between the Chinese and German people can become closer and deeper. We also have a deep hope: that is, to see the leader of the Chinese people, the most loyal friend of the German people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, who is respected by every member of the German working class."

    访德国工会代表团团长古特·海尔比希
    民主德国的工人阶级，都把派遣代表团到我国参加“五一”节观礼，看作一件大事。应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的民主德国工会代表团团长古特·海尔比希说：“我们从国内出发的时候，沿途有许多工人送我们。他们嘱咐我们说：一定要把德国人民的热烈心意带到中国来。”
    古特·海尔比希对记者的谈话，涉及许多方面。显然，他想把中国人民关心的许多事情，都乘此机会谈谈。他首先介绍了民主德国生产建设的成就，和德国人民保卫世界和平运动的情形。他说：虽然希特勒发动的侵略战争给德国人民留下严重的灾难，美帝国主义又把德国撕成两半，给德国的经济建设制造了许多新的困难；但是，德国工人阶级，团结全国人民，依靠着伟大友邦苏联的真诚无私的援助，早在一九五○年九月，便提前三个月完成了两年生产计划，恢复了一九三六年的工业生产水平。德国人民接着开始了一个更伟大的工作——新的五年生产计划。他说：五年计划完成后，将使全国生产量提高到一九五○年生产量的两倍。钢和铁的产量将提高到四倍；将建造二十四万栋住宅楼房，一千万平方公尺的工人住宅；重建起战争中破毁的城市。
    他说：蒸蒸日上的生产建设给德国工人带来了空前未有的幸福。各国营商场已连续十四次减低物价，工人的工资却逐年提高了；大部分工厂都设有托儿所和幼稚园；全国有四百多个文化宫；在风景秀丽的地带，工会为职工设置了许多疗养所，今年夏天，全国将有五十万工人到休养所去（民主德国工人总数约六百万人）。在民主德国，买一斤面包要用十八芬尼（一百芬尼为一马克），买一百克香肠用三十多个芬尼，一套高等质料的西装用一百一十个马克，一架收音机用二百到三百个马克。而一个普通炼钢工人每月便可得工资三百六十到三百八十马克，一个有专门技术的工人可得到五百到七百马克，或者更多。因此，每个德国工人都能过着富裕的生活。
    古特·海尔比希着重说明：民主德国生产建设的速度是过去从来没有过的，这是因为德国人民完全懂得积极从事生产建设，就是对于世界和平的伟大贡献。
    古特·海尔比希简要地介绍了西德工人阶级对于美国压迫者的英勇斗争：美国政府企图和阿登纳订立一个分裂德国、服务于侵略战争的条约，西德右翼工会领袖裴特、非姆河夫表示接受这一战争公约。这个消息传出后，西德各城市的工人立即掀起了暴风雨般的抗议，许多工厂的工人举行了警告性的罢工。有一次，慕尼黑召开了巴伐利亚省工会代表会议，到会代表代表着九十万工会会员。裴特、非姆河夫刚刚在会上提出他们的荒谬意见，立即遭到代表们的严厉斥责，在愤激的群众压迫之下，裴特、非姆河夫只得悄悄地离开会场。从这一个事例中，便可看出西德人民反对分裂、争取祖国统一、要求依照苏联政府所建议的条件缔结和约运动的新高涨，以及他们保卫和平的强大的力量。
    古特·海尔比希谈到他来到北京后的观感。他说：“虽然我还只参观了北京的清华大学和师范大学附属女子中学，但是，我从这两个学校的学生中，已经看到了中国青年的幸福和欢乐。他们不仅可以学到科学知识，而且积极地参加了各种政治活动。我们在北京看到许多新建筑，新的北京正在成长着。”他谈到他们从德国出发前的情景：“代表团的每个同志都把参加第一个德国工会代表团到中国来，引为自己最大的荣幸。许多同志都在羡慕我们。当劳动英雄保尔·鲁兹曼同志要来中国的消息传到他所在的那个钢铁厂的时候，全厂三千多工人都祝贺他有这样大的幸福。”
    最后，古特·海尔比希说：“希望通过我们的工作，能使中德两国人民的友谊更加亲密和深厚。我们还有一个深切的希望：就是能看到中国人民的领袖、德国人民最忠实的友人、德国工人阶级人人敬爱的毛泽东同志。”    （力文）（附图片）
