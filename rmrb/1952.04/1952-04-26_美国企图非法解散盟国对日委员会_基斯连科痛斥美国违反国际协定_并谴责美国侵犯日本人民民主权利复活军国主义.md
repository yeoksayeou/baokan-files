Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 25th: TASS Tokyo, April 24th: At a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on April 23rd, Soviet member Major General Kislenko questioned the accuracy of newspaper reports stating that the Allied Council for Japan would automatically dissolve upon the entry into force of the so-called peace treaty, and that this meeting was the last meeting of the Council.

Acting Chairman Bender confirmed that these reports were correct.

Major General Kislenko then issued the following statement:

“The Allied Council for Japan was established based on the decision of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain, and later with the participation of China. The dissolution of this council is another illegal act by the U.S. government. It is illegal because it is based on the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, the conclusion of which violated the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, regarding Japan.

During the occupation of Japan, even before the conclusion of the separate treaty, the U.S. government seriously violated the above-mentioned nationally agreed decisions concerning Japan. In this regard, it should first be pointed out that the policy of restricting and eliminating the democratic rights and freedoms of the Japanese people and systematically modifying labor legislation to their detriment was carried out by the U.S. occupation authorities in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, and the Far Eastern Commission's decision on the democratization of Japan. For example, on July 31, 1948, at the direct request of the Supreme Commander, workers and employees of Japanese state-owned enterprises and institutions were prohibited from participating in strikes and from negotiating collective agreements with the government. In September 1949, more than one million of these working people were virtually deprived of all political rights. With the consent of the U.S. occupation authorities, the police took many arbitrary actions, such as the dissolution on August 30, 1950, of the National Liaison Council of Trade Unions (Zenroren) – one of Japan's largest trade union organizations, with more than one million workers and other employees. At the same time, twelve leaders of Zenroren were banned from engaging in political and social activities. The Supreme Commander issued orders on June 26 and July 18, 1950, closing down the 'Akahata' newspaper, followed by a comprehensive offensive against progressive newspapers. The democratic United Press Agency and its branches were searched and closed down. By the end of 1951, 2,000 publications of democratic groups and trade unions had been closed down, including the trade union newspapers 'Labor News,' 'Labor Front,' and 'Tabi.'

Under the direct instructions of the U.S. occupation authorities, workers and other employees of Japanese state-owned and private enterprises and institutions were dismissed en masse because of their political beliefs.

Progressive intellectuals were persecuted, and students were expelled from schools, that is to say, a policy of discrimination based on political views was implemented; the police persecuted workers, employees, and students participating in strikes, peace conferences, and demonstrations, and the persecution of active peace fighters has intensified.

Therefore, in its work of occupying Japan, the U.S. occupation authorities not only failed to fulfill the decision to democratize Japan, but also encouraged the establishment of a police regime to deal with democrats and democratic groups.

The unanimous decisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission stipulated the elimination of Japanese militarism and the prevention of its revival. The facts of the past few years, especially the recent situation, show that the U.S. occupation authorities have greatly violated the unanimous decisions of many countries on eliminating Japanese militarism, have been working to revive Japanese militarism, and have been pursuing a policy of encouraging Japanese militarists and revanchist elements. Therefore, war criminals approved for release by the U.S. occupation authorities and active members of former Japanese militarist and extreme nationalist groups and associations are establishing many militarist and extreme nationalist associations. In order to confuse public opinion and to divert the attention of the Japanese people from the true purpose of the U.S. policy toward Japan, the U.S. occupation authorities are inciting war psychology and war propaganda, encouraging the activities of Japanese militarists and revanchist elements, and violating the national interests of the Japanese people, using Japan to implement their aggressive plans in the Far East.

The conclusion of the separate peace treaty with Japan means that the United States continues to pursue a policy that runs counter to the obligations assumed by the U.S. government towards Japan. The conclusion of this treaty shows the extent to which the U.S. government is pursuing a policy of turning Japan into a U.S. military bridgehead in the Far East. Therefore, those separate peace treaties with Japan and so-called security treaties that turn Japan into a country dependent on the United States, into a country that must subordinate its national interests to the aggressive purposes of the U.S. ruling clique, can only be called treaties aimed at preparing for another war in the Far East.

The dissolution of the Allied Council for Japan is the culmination of the U.S. government's policy of blatantly violating its obligations on the Japanese issue, although this Allied Council has never fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it by the 1945 Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain (later joined by China).

As a result of the separate treaty imposed on Japan and the aforementioned 'security treaty,' U.S. troops continue to be stationed in Japan, deepening Japan's dependent status. Therefore, Japan's status has not actually changed. It remains an occupied country, and all the adverse consequences suffered by its national independence and national sovereignty remain. Needless to say, the responsibility for this lies primarily with the U.S. government.

The Soviet government, which firmly advocates the withdrawal of all occupation troops in Japan and advocates the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty with Japan by all relevant countries and Japan, cannot bear any responsibility for the situation that has arisen."

Acting Chairman Bender repeatedly attempted to interrupt Major General Kislenko's speech in a rude manner.

    美国企图非法解散盟国对日委员会
    基斯连科痛斥美国违反国际协定
    并谴责美国侵犯日本人民民主权利复活军国主义
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社东京二十四日讯：盟国对日委员会在四月二十三日举行会议，苏联委员基斯连科少将在会上质问报纸消息所说盟国对日委员会在所谓和约生效时即自行解散及此次会议是委员会最后一次会议一点是否属实。
    代理主席彭德证实这些消息是正确的。
    基斯连科少将接着即发表声明如下：
    “盟国对日委员会是根据苏联、美国和英国及以后并有中国参加的莫斯科外长会议的决定而设立的，解散这个委员会是美国政府的又一次非法行为。它之所以非法，是因为它是以非法的单独对日和约为根据的，这个和约的缔结违反了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、雅尔塔协定、远东委员会的决定及一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言等关于日本的国际协定。
    在占领日本期间，甚至在缔结单独和约以前，美国政府严重地违反了上述国家一致同意的有关日本的决定。关于这一方面，首先应当指出的是限制与取消日本人民民主权利及自由和有系统地对劳工立法作不利的修改的政策，这个政策是美国占领当局违反一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦公告和远东委员会关于日本民主化的决定而进行的。例如，在一九四八年七月三十一日，在总司令的直接要求下，日本国营企业和机关的工人与职员被禁止参加罢工，被禁止与政府进行缔结集体协定的谈判。在一九四九年九月，为数一百多万的这类劳动人民实际差不多被剥夺了全部的政治权利。在美国占领当局的同意下，警察采取了许多专横的行动，例如在一九五零年八月三十日解散了全国工会联络协议会
    （全劳联）——日本最大工会组织之一，拥有工人及其他职员一百多万人。同时，全劳联的十二名领袖被禁止从事政治活动及社会活动。总司令一九五零年六月二十六日和七月十八日发布命令，封闭了‘赤旗报’，接着并对进步报纸进行了全面的进攻。民主的联合通讯社及其各地分社遭受搜查并被封闭。到一九五一年年底为止，民主团体和工会的刊物被封闭者达两千种，包括工会报纸‘劳动新闻’‘劳动战线’及‘地下足袋’等。
    在美国占领当局的直接指使下，日本国营和私营企业与机关的工人和其他职员由于他们的政治信仰而被大批解雇。
    进步知识分子受到迫害，学生被开除出校，这就是说，实行一种因政治见解的不同而加以歧视的政策；警察迫害参加罢工、和平大会和示威的工人、职员和学生，对积极的和平战士的迫害也已变本加厉。
    所以，美国占领当局在占领日本的工作上，不仅没有履行使日本民主化的决定，反而鼓励建立对付民主分子和民主团体的警察政权。
    波茨坦公告和远东委员会的一致决定都规定肃清日本的军国主义并防止其复活。过去几年中的事实，尤其是最近的局势，都说明了美国占领当局大大违反许多国家关于肃清日本军国主义的一致决定，一直在做复活日本军国主义的工作，并奉行鼓励日本军阀和复仇主义分子的政策。所以，美国占领当局批准释放的战犯和前日本军国主义和极端国家主义团体和协会的积极分子，又在成立许多军国主义和极端国家主义的协会。为了要迷惑舆论，为了要使日本人民不注意美国对日政策的真正目的，美国占领当局正在煽动战争心理和战争宣传，鼓动日本军阀和复仇主义分子的活动，并违反日本人民的民族利益，利用要日本来实施他们在远东的侵略计划。
    单独对日和约的缔结，意味着美国仍然继续奉行着与美国政府对日本所承担的义务背道而驰的政策。这种条约的缔结表示，美国政府奉行变日本为美国在远东的军事桥头堡的政策已到了什么程度。因此，那些把日本变为一个依赖美国的国家，变为一个必须把自己的国家利益附属于美国统治集团的侵略目的的国家的单独对日和约和所谓安全条约，只能称之为目的在于准备远东另一次战争的条约。
    盟国对日委员会的解散是美国政府公然违反它在日本问题上所承担的义务的政策发展到了极点，虽然这个盟国委员会绝没有履行一九四五年苏、美、英三国（后来又有中国参加）莫斯科外长会议的决定所委托给它的任务。
    由于强加于日本的单独和约和上述‘安全条约’的结果，美国部队继续驻留在日本，加深了日本的依赖的地位。因此，日本的地位实际上并无改变。它仍然是一个被占领的国家，它的民族独立和国家主权所遭受到的一切不利后果仍然存在。不用说，这种事情的责任主要应由美国政府负担。
    坚决主张撤退在日本的所有占领军并主张所有有关国家和日本缔结真正和约的苏联政府，对于已经产生的形势是不能负任何责任的。”
    代理主席彭德一再粗暴地企图打断基斯连科少将的演说。
