I watched the music and dance performance of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe. Healthy, beautiful, joyful, lively, simple, and forthright artistic images were presented before me. From this, I recognized the excellent temperament of the Magyar nation, and also understood the spirit of cultural construction of the Hungarian people after liberation. I wanted to watch and listen more, I sincerely love their performance! Why? Because it represents the qualities of the Hungarian working people, inherits the fine traditions of Hungarian national art, and also brings together the wealth of folk art. Their music and dance come from the folk, and the performers are revolutionary youths selected from the ranks of workers and peasants. Their performances do not carry a trace of gentility, let alone the atmosphere of the court. Therefore, they appear full of vitality and filled with the joy of victory. Here we see the Hungarian people of today – it is they who completed the Three-Year Plan in two years and five months; it is they who healed the wounds of war at an accelerated pace, and are carrying out the peaceful construction of the Five-Year Plan. Today their representatives, the comrades of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe, came to meet us, to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, what an exciting thing it is!

Every one of their songs and every one of their dances is full of enthusiasm, and their performing skills are excellent: the band has only twenty or so people, but the power is not small. The volume is grand and the emotion is rich. Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody is really not easy to play so well! The best thing is that they did not put on airs at all when they played. If this kind of piece is given to an academic band to play, it will become a different flavor.

Their choir is very well trained. If they hadn't put in hard work in vocal training, it would be impossible to sing so harmoniously. Many songs are sung well, I like "Rakosi Song", "Donbass Song", "Song of Dusk" the most... Singing, whether high or low, is always satisfactory, the high notes do not seem strained, and the low notes are harmonious and beautiful, able to bring people into the music.

I like "Bottle Dance", "Spur Kick Dance", and "Weaving Room Dance" the most. I also like the tribute dance and the wedding dance. I think these dances are very well organized. You can see that it is art from the folk, and you can also see that there is appropriate processing. What attracts us is not exoticism, but a youthful joy. Especially valuable is the deep earthy atmosphere. Every action, every breath, is closely linked to the lives of the people.

Hungarian artists have learned a lot from Soviet folk art. But it is not plagiarism, not imitation, but the acceptance of an inspiration, obtaining a mirror; identifying the correct direction, and engaging in creation. On the one hand, they inherit the traditions of classical art, and on the other hand, they delve into the folk, drawing on an inexhaustible source. This is the same path we are taking. Therefore, we feel close when we watch their performances. We are willing to learn more from the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe. Their visit left a deep and beautiful impression on the spiritual life of the Chinese people.

    我喜爱匈牙利人民的艺术
    中央戏剧学院院长  欧阳予倩
    我看了匈牙利国家人民文工团的音乐舞蹈表演。健康、美丽、愉快、活泼、朴素而爽朗的艺术形象呈现在我面前。从这里，我认识了马加尔民族优秀的气质，也认识了解放后匈牙利人民文化建设的精神。我看了还想看，听了还想听，我由衷地爱他们的表演！为什么？因为它代表着匈牙利的劳动人民的品质，承继了匈牙利民族艺术的优良传统，也荟集了民间艺术的财富。他们的音乐和舞蹈来自民间，表演者都是从工农队伍中选拔出来的革命青年，他们的表演不带丝毫绅士气，更没有宫廷的气息。所以显得生气勃勃，充满着胜利的喜悦。在这里我们看见了今日的匈牙利人民——正是他们，两年零五个月完成了三年计划；正是他们，超速度医愈了战争的创伤，在进行五年计划的和平建设。今天他们的代表，匈牙利国家人民文工团的同志们来和我们见了面，来向毛主席献礼，这是多么令人兴奋的事呵！
    他们每一个曲子，每一个舞蹈都充满着热情，他们的表演技术都很好：乐队不过二十来个人，可是威力不小。音量宏达而声情并茂。李斯特的第二狂想曲，真不容易奏得那样好！最好的是他们演奏的时候丝毫没有装腔作势，这种曲子拿给学院派的乐队一奏，就会变成另外一种味道了。
    他们的合唱队训练得很好。在练声方面如果没下过苦工，决不可能唱得那样谐和。许多曲子都唱得好，我最欢喜“拉科西颂”，“顿巴曲”，“黄昏之歌”……唱起来，高唱低吟无不如意，高处不显得吃力，低吟处又和美异常，能把人唱到音乐里头去。
    舞蹈我最喜欢“瓶舞”，“踢马刺舞”，和“纺织房舞”。我也喜欢献礼舞，和结婚舞。我觉得这些舞都组织得很好。看得出是民间来的艺术，也看得出有适当的加工。吸引我们的并不是异国情调，而是一种青春喜悦之气。尤其可贵的是深厚的泥土气息。每一动作，每一呼吸，都和人民的生活紧密地结合着。
    匈牙利的艺术工作者们，向苏联民间艺术学习很多。但不是抄袭，不是摹仿，而是接受了一种启示，得到借镜；认清了正确的方向，从事创作。一方面承受古典艺术的传统，一方面深入民间，汲取无尽的源泉。这和我们所走的路是一样的。因此我们看他们的表演感到亲切。我们愿多多向匈牙利国家人民文工团学习，他们此次来访，在中国人民的精神生活中留下了深刻美满的印象。
