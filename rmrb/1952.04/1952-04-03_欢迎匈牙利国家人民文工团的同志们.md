    Welcome, Comrades of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe
    Zǐ Gāng
    As members of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe, your arrival from the banks of the Danube in Eastern Europe to China allows us to feel the warmth of your 9.3 million people. You are a passionate nation; anyone who has visited your country and come into contact with your people will feel your enthusiasm is like boiling water, that warmth rushes towards your beloved friends like a warm breeze.
    Geographically, we are far apart, but only a bond of peace and democracy ties us closely together. Your factories, collective farms, and schools often use "Mao Zedong" as a unit name, and many of our primary school students recognize the picture of your leader, Comrade Rákosi.
    We have something in common, and that is the ideology of moving towards a socialist and communist society. This ideology is like a chemical, eliminating all the differences between our races, skin colors, languages, and customs.
    Your people have greeted and welcomed the representatives of the new China who stepped into your country with surging enthusiasm. Your people, old and young, clapped their hands and shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Salute to the heroic Chinese people!" The history of the Hungarian people is a history of resistance against German oppression and German attempts to destroy Hungary. During the Second World War, you suffered unparalleled and devastating destruction. Only those who have risen from such deep disasters can so deeply love the Chinese people, who did not easily achieve today's victory.
    You often want us to understand the devastation that the Nazis brought to you before pointing out the achievements of construction since liberation: 45% of the national wealth was destroyed in the war, 21.4% of agricultural equipment, 38% of industry and mining, 18% of houses, 44% of cattle and sheep, 39% of horses, 78% of pigs, 69% of locomotives, and 86% of freight cars were all destroyed.
    However, after liberation, you eliminated the domestic reactionary forces and confiscated the banks, industry, and commerce controlled by the capitalists, allowing more than 640,000 poor peasants and farm laborers to receive land. Old Hungary, known as the home of three million poor peasants and tenant farmers, that title was forever buried. The three-year plan was completed ahead of schedule at the end of 1949. Now it is the middle of your five-year plan, in which you want to have 35,000 university students in your people's universities and install electrical equipment in more than one million households... Your workers and farmers are looking up to the workers and farmers of the Soviet Union. Your Young Pioneers wearing gray shirts and red scarves, and the Young Pioneers wearing white shirts and blue scarves, are so strong and lively. They care about their happy lives and even more about world peace, and they hate the enemies of peace headed by US imperialism.
    Before the war, you had never produced heavy-duty machine tools, but now your machinery industry is developing rapidly, and the production of locomotives and ships has greatly expanded. The five-year plan calls for the production of complex agricultural machinery such as combine harvesters, as well as transportation machinery. When we read in the newspaper that last year—the second year of your five-year plan—you completed 103.4% of the industry; and that last year's agricultural harvest was the best year since your liberation, we were as happy as if we were celebrating our own achievements. "The Hungarian people under the leadership of Comrade Rákosi are really outstanding," we say. He teaches you: Labor is honor. Your women perform no less well on the labor front, and nearly half of the female workers have become skilled workers in factories. You have construction teams composed entirely of women. In the agricultural cooperative movement, 30% of the members are women... These messages are admired by your Eastern friends—the people of New China.
    Last February, Comrade Rákosi said: "We, the Hungarian working people, can guarantee that we will continue to fight unremittingly, faithfully, and without sparing any effort on the front of defending peace. Whenever there is a need to sacrifice for the great cause of peace, we will forge ahead bravely!"
    The actions of your people have faithfully put Comrade Rákosi's speech into practice. When the Chinese People's Volunteers were resisting the US and aiding Korea based on a combination of patriotism and internationalism, your people's medical team also traveled thousands of miles to get there, along with gifts and letters of condolences. Therefore, the name "Hungary" is a well-known and friendly name among our volunteer soldiers.
    When our dramas, songs, dances, or art exhibitions appear in your country, you give them a warm welcome and sincere criticism. The national forms of art between our two countries can be said to be very different, but the national forms represent different and valuable artistic traditions, and that same political ideal connects us. Thus, we can appreciate and accept different works of art.
    You have come as glorious cultural envoys of Hungary. Our people will gladly appreciate and learn from your songs and dances. You are a nation with excellent cultural traditions. We have known how much you cherish your cultural heritage. Your museums make foreign visitors linger, and the sculptures on the streets of Budapest are so beautiful. And how much do you respect your national poet Petőfi, who participated in leading the 1848 revolution? His statues and photos can be seen everywhere in wall newspapers, art galleries, and workers' clubs. His poems inspired the people to fight against the reactionary rulers. And on the banks of the Danube, the Liberty Statue holding a palm leaf on Gellért Hill is your beautiful ideal for generations. Now, under this Liberty Statue, the Soviet Red Army Memorial Tower has been built to never forget the 15,000 Soviet troops who shed blood and sacrificed themselves for the liberation of Hungary.
    Today, we are all fighting in the peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union. You have not come as distant guests, but as close comrades with common ideals. Therefore, we not only want to say "Szervusz" [Note 1], but also raise our arms and say "Szabadság" [Note 2] to you! We wish your performances will contribute to the increase of friendship between the people of our two countries!
    [Note 1]: "Szervusz," Hungarian for "Hello."
    [Note 2]: "Szabadság," Hungarian for the meaning of the struggle for freedom, is commonly used among comrades.

    欢迎匈牙利国家人民文工团的同志们
    子冈
    作为匈牙利国家人民文工团的团员的你们，从东欧的多瑙河畔来到了中国，这使我们感觉到你们九百三十万人民的热情。你们是热情的民族，凡是到过你们的国土、接触过你们的人民的人，都会感觉到你们的热情如沸，那热情好像暖风一样地向着你们喜欢的朋友扑面而来。
    在地理上我们相距很远，但是只因为一条和平民主的纽带，把我们联系得很紧，你们的工厂农庄学校常以“毛泽东”作为一个单位的名称，而我们的许多小学生都认识了你们的领袖拉科西同志的像片。
    我们之间有共同的东西，那就是走向社会主义和共产主义社会的思想。这个思想像是一种化学药品，泯除了我们种族、肤色、语言、风俗间的种种不同。
    你们的人民曾以澎湃的热情招待了、欢迎了踏进你们国土的新中国人民的代表们。你们老老少少拍着掌喊：“毛泽东万岁！”“向英雄的中国人民致敬！”匈牙利人民的历史是一部反抗德国压迫、反抗德国企图毁灭匈牙利的斗争史，在第二次世界大战中你们遭受到无比惨烈的毁坏，只有从那么深的祸害中站立起来的人们，才能对也不是轻易获得今天的胜利的中国人民那么热爱。
    你们往往在指给我们看解放以后的建设成绩之前，先要我们认识纳粹给你们带来的浩劫：国家财富的百分之四十五在战争中被毁坏，百分之二十一·四的农业设备，百分之三十八的工矿，百分之十八的房屋，百分之四十四的牛羊，百分之三十九的马匹，百分之七十八的猪，百分之六十九的火车头，百分之八十六的货车，统通被毁坏了。
    可是你们在解放以后，清除了国内的反动势力，没收了资本家掌握的银行、工商业；使得六十四万多贫农雇农分得了土地，旧匈牙利号称三百万贫农佃农之家，那个称号永远地被埋葬了。三年计划提前在一九四九年年底完成。如今是你们的五年计划走在中途的时候了，在这个计划里要使得你们的人民大学里有三万五千名大学生，要在一百万以上人口的家庭中装置电气设备……你们的工人农民是向着苏联的工人农民看齐的。你们的穿灰布衬衫系红领巾的青年团团员，穿白衬衣系蓝领巾的少年先锋队队员，他们是多么刚健活泼，他们关心自己的幸福生活，更关心世界和平，痛恨以美帝国主义为首的和平死敌。
    在战前，你们从没有生产过重型母机，但是如今你们的机械工业在飞速地发展着，机车和船舶的生产大大扩充。五年计划号召生产联合收割机之类的复杂农业机器，以及运输机器。当我们从报纸上读到去年——你们的五年计划的第二年完成了工业的百分之一百零三点四；去年的农业收成是你们解放以后最好的一年的时候，我们就像是为庆贺自己的成就一样欢喜。“拉科西同志领导下的匈牙利人民真是出色呀”，我们说。他教导你们：劳动就是荣誉。你们的妇女在劳动战线上的表现一点也不差，接近半数的女工成为工厂里的熟练工人。你们有纯粹由妇女组成的建筑队。在农业合作运动中，百分之三十的社员是妇女……这些消息，都是让你们的东方朋友——新中国的人民欣羡的。
    去年二月，拉科西同志说过：“我们匈牙利劳动人民能够保证我们将继续不懈地、忠诚地并且不吝惜力量地在保卫和平战线上战斗，任何需要为伟大的和平事业献身的时候，我们都将勇往直前！”
    你们人民的行动是忠实地实践了拉科西同志的讲话的。当中国人民志愿军在爱国主义和国际主义精神相结合的基础上抗美援朝的时候，你们人民的医疗队也万里跋涉地赶到了，还有慰劳品和慰问信，所以“匈牙利”这个国家的名字，在我们志愿军战士中是一个颇为熟知而且友好的名字。
    当我们的戏剧歌舞或是艺术展览品在你们的国家中出现的时候，你们给予了热烈的欢迎和诚恳的批评。我们两国间艺术的民族形式可以说是迥然不同的，但是彼此的民族形式代表了不同的可贵的艺术传统，而那同一的政治理想沟通了我们，于是我们彼此可以欣赏而且接受不同的艺术作品。
    作为匈牙利的光辉的文化使节，你们来到了。我们的人民将要欣悦地鉴赏、学习你们的歌舞。你们是有着优秀的文化传统的民族，我们曾经知道你们是多么珍爱自己的文化遗产的民族，你们的博物馆使异国的参观人留恋忘返，你们布达佩斯街头的雕塑是那么美丽；而你们对于参加领导一八四八年革命的民族诗人彼多斐，是多么敬重啊，在壁报上、美术馆和工人俱乐部里，到处可以见到他的塑像和照片，他的诗篇曾鼓舞着人民战斗，向反动的统治者战斗。而多瑙河畔，格勒特山上手擎棕榈叶的自由神像是你们世世代代美好的理想。如今在这自由神像下，为了对解放匈牙利流血牺牲的一万五千苏军永世不忘，又建立了苏联红军纪念塔。
    今天，我们大家都在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中战斗着。你们不是作为远客来了，而是作为有着共同理想的亲密的同志来了，所以我们不只要说一句“赛尔布斯”〔注一〕，而且要举臂向你们道一声“萨勃卡”〔注二〕！祝你们的演出有助于我们两国人民友谊的增进！
    〔注一〕：“赛尔布斯”，匈语“你好”。
    〔注二〕：“萨勃卡”，匈语为自由斗争之意，惯用于同志间。
