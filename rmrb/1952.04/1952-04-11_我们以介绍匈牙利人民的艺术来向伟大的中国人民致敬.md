    We Salute the Great Chinese People by Introducing the Art of the Hungarian People
    By Xièlèixī Jiūlá, Head of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe

    We are very pleased to be able to pay tribute to the heroic Chinese people and to express our warmest respect to our Chinese friends through the newspaper on behalf of our people, Hungarian artists, and all members of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe. We would like to express our gratitude once again for the unforgettable and thoughtful hospitality we have received since our arrival here, as well as for all the love and friendship. We deeply know that this expression of friendship is given to the people in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, who are fighting side by side for the peace and freedom of mankind.

    The Hungarian people clearly understand the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and their current struggle against American aggression in Korea. Under the current circumstances, the Hungarian people are fighting for peace by continuously increasing production and intensifying the construction of socialism at home.

    I would like to say a few words to introduce the tasks and purposes of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe, as well as the role it plays in Hungarian artistic life.

    The birth of our art troupe is the result of the cultural revolution that accompanied the achievements of our country's political and economic life. The National Art Troupe was established to enable the broad masses to recognize the treasures of people's art, and to turn them into the common property of all the people by promoting people's traditions and collecting past Hungarian folk songs and folk dances, carrying forward people's traditions, and introducing them to the broad masses. The secondary task of the art troupe is to help composers, dancers, and artists to express the various problems of the new society, the new life, the feelings of new-type people, and the heroic figures in construction work.

    The three components of the art troupe—the choir, the orchestra, and the dance troupe—have fixed rehearsals every day. In this way, these three groups prepare each new program: they divide into small groups and visit various villages in the Hungarian countryside, where they maintain contact with literary and artistic groups and visit the elderly who are still familiar with the folk songs and folk dances of the past, talk to them several times, take notes, and film the folk dances. These collected materials are then selected and used as the basic content of the new program.

    This work of collecting materials is also helpful to literary and artistic groups in the countryside. Because when the musicians, singers, and dancers of the art troupe stay in the countryside, they also help them develop cultural work.

    The performance of new and old programs is, of course, the greatest help to literary and artistic groups in factories and rural areas. In this way, they can clearly see the methods they need to learn.

    In addition to the National People's Art Troupe, we also have four other art troupes that adopt the same working methods. They are: the People's Army Art Troupe, the Ministry of National Defense Art Troupe, the newly established Trade Union Art Troupe, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs Art Troupe.

    The literary and artistic groups in factories and rural areas adopt the dances, songs, and music of the above-mentioned professional art troupes, and apply them according to their own needs. They reflect the most pressing problems in factory or rural production in their programs. They commend the excellent performers in production and ridicule those who are backward. Therefore, professional art troupes directly help to increase production.

    But this is not the only way to help. The performance of the art troupe closely links the people's art with the broad masses, thus making the people's life better and more joyful. And a better and more joyful life can improve work and increase production.

    The Hungarian Art Troupe and the Soviet National People's Art Troupe, which visited Hungary in 1951, have repeatedly exchanged experiences. The visits to Czechoslovakia and Berlin, as well as the several meetings with the Chinese Youth Art Troupe in Budapest, have played an important role in improving the art of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe.

    The meeting with the Chinese Youth Art Troupe is unforgettable for all of us. This was the first time our art troupe had met Chinese comrades and Chinese youth, which made us directly aware of the art of the Chinese people. For the first time, we felt the warm and sincere friendship of the great Chinese people towards us. Therefore, when the members of our art troupe arrived in China, when they met those Chinese comrades and youths who had visited Budapest in the Northeast, Shenyang, and Beijing, they felt as if they were meeting their best and dearest friends. All of us felt at home.

    When we arrived in China, the feeling of the great distance between our two countries immediately disappeared, and we only felt that we were very close to each other. There is an unbreakable friendship and affection between the heroic Chinese people and the Hungarian people. We fully understand that this is because the common ideas of Marxism-Leninism guide the people of our two countries, who are important soldiers in the peace camp led by the great Stalin to defend the cause of peace.

    我们以介绍匈牙利人民的艺术来向伟大的中国人民致敬
    匈牙利国家人民文工团团长  歇勒西·纠腊
    我们十分高兴，能够向英勇的中国人民致敬，能够通过报纸向中国友人表示我国人民、匈牙利艺术家和匈牙利国家人民文工团全体团员的最热烈的敬意。对于我们自从抵达此间以后所受到的难以忘怀的周到招待，以及所有的热爱和友谊，我们要再一次地表示感谢。我们深切地知道，这种友谊的表现，是给予以苏联为首的和平阵营中的人民的，他们正在为人类的和平和自由而并肩战斗着。
    匈牙利人民清楚地了解中国人民争取自由以及他们目前在朝鲜反对美国侵略的斗争。在目前的情形之下，匈牙利人民以在国内不断增加生产和加紧建设社会主义的行动来为和平而斗争。
    我想用几句话来介绍一下匈牙利国家人民文工团的任务和目的，以及它在匈牙利艺术生活中所起的作用。
    我们文工团的诞生，是伴随着我国政治和经济生活所获得的成就而来的文化革命的结果。国家文工团的成立，是为了使广大群众得以认识人民艺术的宝藏，并用推广人民的传统和搜集过去的匈牙利民间歌曲和民间舞蹈的方式，来把它们变成为全民所有的共同财产，发扬人民的传统，并把它们介绍给广大的群众。文工团的次一任务是帮助作曲家、舞蹈家和艺术家去表现新社会的各种问题，新的生活，新型人物的感情，和建设工作中的英雄人物。
    文工团的三个组成部分——合唱团、管弦乐队和舞蹈团每天都有固定的排演。这三个团体用这种方式来准备每一个新的节目：他们分成小组后访问匈牙利乡间的各个农村，在那里和文艺团体保持接触，并拜访那些还熟悉过去的民歌和民间舞蹈的老人，和他们交谈几次，做笔记，并把民间舞蹈摄成影片。这些搜集来的材料经过精选以后就作为新节目的基本内容。
    这种搜集材料的工作，对于乡间的文艺团体也是有帮助的。因为文工团的音乐家、歌唱家和舞蹈家逗留乡间的时候，也帮助了他们发展文化工作。
    新的和旧有节目的演出，对于工厂和农村的文艺团体当然是最大的帮助。这样，他们就能够清楚地看到他们所需要学习的方法。
    除了国家人民文工团之外，我们还有采取着同样工作方式的四个别的艺术文工团。它们是：人民军文工团、国防部文工团、新近成立的职工会文工团和内务部文工团。
    工厂和农村的文艺团体采用上述各专业文工团的舞蹈、歌曲和音乐，并按照它们自己的需要加以应用。它们在节目中反映了工厂或农村生产中最迫切的问题。它们表扬生产中的优秀者而取笑那些落后分子。因此，专业文工团就对增加生产起了直接的帮助。
    但这并不是帮助的唯一方法。文工团的表演使人民的艺术和广大群众紧密地联系起来，因而使人民的生活变得更加美好，更加愉快。而美好和愉快的生活则能够改善工作，提高生产。
    匈牙利文工团和曾在一九五一年访问过匈牙利的苏联国家人民文工团一再交流经验，赴捷克斯洛伐克和柏林的访问，以及和中国青年文工团在布达佩斯的几次会见，对于匈牙利国家人民文工团艺术的改进，起着重要的作用。
    和中国青年文工团的会见，使我们所有的人都难以忘怀。这是我们文工团第一次会见中国的同志和中国的青年们，这使我们直接地认识了中国人民的艺术。我们第一次感觉到了伟大的中国人民对于我们的热烈和真诚的友谊。所以，当我们文工团的团员们抵达中国的时候，当他们在东北、沈阳和北京遇到了那些曾经访问过布达佩斯的中国同志和青年们的时候，他们感到似乎会见了他们最好的和最亲切的朋友。我们所有的人都有在家里一样的感觉。
    当我们抵达中国的时候，介于我们两国之间的遥远距离的感觉立刻消失了，我们只感到我们彼此是非常亲近的。在英勇的中国人民和匈牙利人民之间有着牢不可破的友谊和感情。我们十分了解，这是因为马克思列宁主义的共同思想领导着我们两国人民，他们是在伟大的斯大林所领导的和平阵营中保卫和平事业的重要战士。
