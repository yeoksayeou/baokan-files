    "No Time" to Read the Newspaper is Not a Fact
    Beijing First Hospital Inspects Current Affairs Study
    Editor: After reading the criticism in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 22 regarding the neglect of reading newspapers by some medical personnel, our Beijing First Hospital immediately conducted an inspection.
    Most doctors in our hospital read newspapers regularly, but the vast majority of nurses and assistant nurses rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all. Like some personnel in other hospitals, these people emphasize that they are "busy with work" and "have no time to read newspapers." After the "Three-Anti" campaign began, even fewer of these people read newspapers. A doctor in the obstetrics and gynecology department said, "The time for watching movies has decreased, so there is no need to look for movie advertisements in the newspaper." A nurse in the surgical ward said, "When I have some free time, I need to read professional books and brush up on my English in preparation for transferring to another hospital, so I don't have time to read newspapers." There are seven staff members in that ward, and the hospital has subscribed to a newspaper for them for three months, but there are still two people who have no idea that such a newspaper exists. Many people in our hospital are unaware of major international and domestic events, and they are also unaware of the criticism of medical personnel neglecting reading newspapers in the People's Daily on March 22.
    As a result of the inspection, we realize that the fundamental problem in our hospital is neglecting politics. Emphasizing "no time" and "busy with work" is an excuse for neglecting newspaper reading and study.
    We are reporting the above situation to you first, and we will propose measures to strengthen current affairs and political study within days. We will write to you again later to tell you the results of the implementation.

### “没有时间”读报不是事实  北京市第一医院检查时事学习

    “没有时间”读报不是事实
    北京市第一医院检查时事学习
    编辑同志：读过三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏对某些医务人员忽视读报的批评后，我们北京市第一医院立即进行了一次检查。
    我院大部分医生都能经常阅读报纸，但绝大多数的护士、助理护士却不常读报，或根本不读报。这些人也像其他医院的某些人员一样，强调“工作忙”，“没时间看报”。“三反”开始后，这些人更少看报了。妇产科的一位大夫说：“看电影的时间少了，也就用不着找报纸看电影广告了。”外科病房的一位护士说：“有点空还需要看看业务书，补习英文，准备跳院转业，所以没有时间看报。”该病房共有七个工作人员，院方为他们订了一份报纸，已经有三个月了，但至今还有两个人根本不知道有这么一份报纸。我院有许多人不知道国际国内所发生的重大事件，同样也不知道三月二十二日人民日报对医务人员忽视读报的批评。
    检查结果，我们认识到：我们医院当前的基本问题是忽视政治。强调“没有时间”、“工作忙”是忽视读报学习的藉口。
    我们先把上述情况报告给你们，日内我们将提出加强时事政治学习的办法。实施结果，以后再写信告诉你们。北京市第一医院
