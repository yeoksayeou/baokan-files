	The quack doctor Yi Jianqing in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, fabricated drugs and swindled people, repeatedly causing loss of life. In late February, a patient had a slight pain in his waist and took two packets of his medicine, immediately vomiting and sweating, his limbs became cold, his hands and feet turned blue, and he became unconscious. People carried the patient to the People's Hospital, and he was rescued after emergency treatment. In early March, resident Li Huanqing also experienced the same situation after taking two packets of Yi Jianqing's medicine. A woman had a tumor on her breast, and Yi Jianqing cut it open for her with a "corn knife," causing continuous bleeding. Later, the wound festered, and she died. Another patient, Li Xiaolao, had swelling all over his body and died in the afternoon after taking Yi Jianqing's medicine in the morning. Farmer Lai Kangchou suffered from tuberculous lymphadenitis, and Yi Jianqing said: Only by drinking "magic water" can he get better. The first time, he gave the patient a glass of cold water and cheated him of 80,000 yuan. The second time, he gave the patient two packets of medicine and cheated him of 140,000 yuan. The patient died of poisoning after taking the medicine. The People's Government found more than ten kinds of fake medicines in Yi Jianqing's home, including a bottle of "eye drops" made with liquor. Using it to treat eye diseases could very likely cause blindness. Yi Jianqing swindled and cheated, endangering people's health, and has been arrested by the People's Government.
	"Doctors" like Yi Jianqing, who make a living by swindling money and causing harm, are not isolated cases. In order to ensure the health of the people, local health authorities should strictly review doctors, and those quack doctors who have no medical knowledge, no clinical experience, and specialize in defrauding the people of their money should be prohibited from practicing medicine.

    各地卫生领导部门应该严格
    审查开业医生的医疗能力
    湖南平江县庸医易简清，伪造药品，招摇撞骗，屡次贻误人命。二月下旬，有一个病人腰部微痛，服了他的两包药，顿时呕吐发汗，四肢冰冷，手足发青，继而不省人事。人们把病人抬到人民医院，经急救后才转危为安。三月初，居民李浣清服了易简清的两包药，也发生同样的情况。有一位妇人乳部生一瘤子，易简清用“修脚刀”替她割开后，水流不止，后来伤口溃烂，随之身死。又一病人李校老，全身发肿，上午吃了易简清的药，下午就死了。农民赖抗仇患淋巴腺结核，易简清说：非吃“画符水”不能好。第一次他给病人吃了一杯冷水，骗了人民币八万元；第二次给病人两包药，又骗了人民币十四万元。病人服药后，中毒身死。人民政府从易简清家里查出了假药十多种，其中有一瓶“点眼水”，是用烧酒作的。用它治眼病，很有使人失明的可能。易简清招摇撞骗，危害人民健康，已由人民政府逮捕。
    像易简清这种以骗财害命为业的“医生”，并非是个别的。为了确保人民的健康，各地卫生机关应严格地审查医生，对无医学知识、又无临床经验、专门欺诈人民钱财的庸医，应禁止其开业。
