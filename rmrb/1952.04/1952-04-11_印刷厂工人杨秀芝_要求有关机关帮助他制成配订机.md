Printing Factory Worker Yang Xiuzhi
Requests Assistance from Relevant Authorities to Manufacture a Collating and Binding Machine

To the Editor: Last September, the Central Bureau of Technology Administration and the General Administration of Publications, in order to help me gain experience, sent people to accompany me to Shanghai to visit the long-carriage collating and binding machine. After returning to Beijing, Director Zhong of the Central Bureau of Technology Administration went to the Northeast, and it was agreed to hold a forum with the printing industry upon his return to Beijing to discuss the problem of making a model of the collating and binding machine. After Director Zhong returned, the “Three-Anti” movement began, and the forum with the printing industry was therefore put on hold.

Starting last November, I used simple materials and ironware to make two machine models, one is a collating machine, and the other is a covering machine. If I can make a model of a bookbinding machine, the three machines together will be a complete collating and binding machine. However, the precision of these two models is far from satisfactory. I am a worker and do not understand mechanics at all. The models I made are based solely on practical considerations, and there must be many parts that need to be modified. I urgently need the help of mechanical experts.

I request the Central Bureau of Technology Administration and the General Administration of Publications to quickly convene a forum to offer more suggestions on the models I have made and to provide some manpower and materials so that the collating and binding machine can be manufactured as soon as possible and contributed to the country.

Binding Worker, Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, Yang Xiuzhi

    印刷厂工人杨秀芝
    要求有关机关帮助他制成配订机
    编辑同志：去年九月，中央技术管理局和出版总署为了帮助我吸取经验，曾派人陪同我到上海参观长车配订机。回京以后，因中央技术管理局钟局长去东北，说好等他返京再召开印刷界座谈会，研究做配订机的模型问题。钟局长回来后，“三反”运动就开始了，印刷界座谈会因此搁置。
    从去年十一月开始，我用简单的工料和铁器做成了两部机器的模型，一部是配合机，一部是裹皮机。如果再把订书机模型做好，三部机器联合起来，就是一部完整的配订机了。但这两个模型的精确程度还差得远。我是工人出身，根本不懂机械，所制模型只从实际出发，其中一定有不少机件必须修改。我是迫切需要机械专家们的帮助的。
    我要求中央技术管理局和出版总署，很快地召开一个座谈会，对我做的模型多提些意见，并帮助些人力、物力，以期配订机早日制成，贡献给国家。
    华北军区政治部印刷厂装订工人  杨秀芝
