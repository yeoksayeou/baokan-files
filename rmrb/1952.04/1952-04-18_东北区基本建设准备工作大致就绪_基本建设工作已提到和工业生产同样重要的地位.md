    Basic Construction Preparations in Northeast China Basically Completed
    Basic Construction Work Raised to the Same Important Position as Industrial Production
    Preparations for basic construction in Northeast China this year have been largely completed, and many projects have already started.
    Due to the rapid recovery and development of the national economy in Northeast China, basic construction work has been raised to the same important position as industrial production, and in certain specific basic industrial sectors, the position of basic construction has even surpassed production.
    In order to strengthen the design work of civil engineering, all units are conducting designs according to the "Provisional Standard for Structural Design of Buildings" formulated by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government. Units such as the Northeast Light Industry Bureau have even held civil engineering design research classes to unify the design methods of all designers. After the design technology was unified according to the new standards, the design efficiency of all units has generally improved.
    This year, the work of recruiting construction workers and preparing building materials in various units has generally been more planned than in previous years. For example, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government began to organize more than 20,000 construction workers scattered throughout the region in October last year, and then systematically allocated them to various basic construction departments, overcoming the shortcomings of previous years where blind recruitment by construction units resulted in inconsistent wages and failure to guarantee project quality. The Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau also pre-signed brick purchase contracts with kiln factories near the construction site, avoiding the danger of brick shortages occurring in April and May that affected construction in previous years.

    东北区基本建设准备工作大致就绪
    基本建设工作已提到和工业生产同样重要的地位
    东北区今年基本建设准备工作已大致就绪，许多工程已经动工。
    东北区由于国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，基本建设工作已提到和工业生产同样重要的地位，在某些特定的基础工业部门中，基本建设的地位甚至已超过了生产。
    为了加强土木工程的设计工作，各单位都根据东北人民政府工业部制订的“建筑物结构设计暂行标准”进行设计。东北轻工业管理局等单位更举办了土木建筑设计研究班，使所有设计人员的设计方法统一起来。各单位根据新标准统一了设计技术以后，设计效能都普遍提高。
    今年各单位关于招收建筑工人和准备建筑材料的工作，一般都比往年更有计划，如松江省人民政府从去年十月开始就把流散在各地的两万多建筑工人统统组织起来，然后有计划地调配给各基本建设部门，克服了往年因各施工单位盲目招工，造成工资不一，又不能保证工程质量的缺点。东北电器工业管理局还预先和工地附近的窑业工厂订立了购砖合同，避免了往年因四、五月间发生砖荒而影响施工的危险。　（新华社）
