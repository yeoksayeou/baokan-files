    We must make the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea shine even more brilliantly
    (I)
    Comrade Editor: We are volunteer soldiers who have returned from Korea to the motherland to study. When we saw the news about the awarding of the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, we all jumped for joy. Some comrades were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes. Soon, we will be wearing a glorious and beautiful medal on our chests. This is our glory, and also the glory of the heroic people of the motherland. Today, we must work hard in our positions and improve our skills; when we go to the Korean front again, we will more bravely annihilate the enemy, so that the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea that we will soon be wearing on our chests will shine even more brilliantly. This will be our way of repaying the love and respect of the people of the motherland for us.
                         All soldiers of a certain class of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    (II)
    Comrade Editor: I don't know how to express what's in my heart. Maybe I'm too excited. When I saw the resolution on the awarding of the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea published in the People's Daily on March 24, I jumped for joy. The comrades around me also scrambled to read the newspaper. We recalled the hard fighting life in Korea, and everyone laughed. The spirit of internationalism and patriotism encouraged us. We went to Korea to fight the American aggressors, and we have received the honor we deserve. Of course, we know that this honor was given to us by the wise Chairman Mao and all the people of the motherland. The glorious Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea will soon be hanging on our chests, how happy we will be then! I have just returned from Korea to study in the motherland. Although I cannot directly participate in the battle now, I guarantee that I will study hard. When I return to the Korean battlefield, I will be even stronger and braver in annihilating the enemy, so that I will be worthy of wearing the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea.
                            Volunteer soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Wu Ying

    我们要使挂在胸前的抗美援朝纪念章更加光辉灿烂
    （一）
    编辑同志：我们是从朝鲜回祖国来学习的志愿军战士，我们看到颁发抗美援朝纪念章的消息，大家都高兴得跳起来。有些同志兴奋得淌出热泪。不久之后，我们胸前就要挂上一枚光荣美丽的纪念章了，这是我们的光荣，也是祖国英雄的人民的光荣。我们今天要在自己的岗位上努力学习，提高自己的本领；等到再往朝鲜前线，我们将更加英勇地消灭敌人，使我们即将挂在胸前的抗美援朝纪念章，越发光辉灿烂，这样才算回答了祖国人民对我们的爱戴与尊敬。
                         中国人民志愿军某部某班全体战士
    （二）
    编辑同志：我不知道怎样才能说出我内心里的话。也许我是太兴奋了。当我看到三月二十四日人民日报上登载的关于颁发抗美援朝纪念章的决议时，我喜欢得跳起来了。围在我四周的同志们也都抢着来看报。我们回忆起在朝鲜的艰苦的战斗生活，大家都笑了。国际主义与爱国主义的精神鼓舞着我们，我们到朝鲜打击美国侵略者，我们得到了应有的荣誉。当然，我们知道这荣誉是英明的毛主席和祖国全体人民给予我们的。光荣的抗美援朝纪念章，不久就要悬挂在我们的胸前了，那时我们要如何的快乐啊！我是刚从朝鲜回到祖国学习，现在虽然不能直接参加战斗，我保证要学习好。等到重返朝鲜战场时，我要更加坚强勇敢地消灭敌人，这样才不愧为挂抗美援朝纪念章的人。
