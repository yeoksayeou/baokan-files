In the wake of successive victories in the "Five-Anti" campaign, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government continues to expand its processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending activities to private industrial and commercial enterprises, helping private industries beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to develop production healthily after eliminating the "Five Evils." In the first half of April, more than 3,000 private factories and businesses in Shanghai, covering 34 industries, received assistance from the People's Government, resulting in a significant increase in the production index compared to the previous month. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau, the commodity tax collected from April 1st to April 11th increased by 24.55% compared to the same period last month.

Many of these assisted private factories and businesses were serious lawbreakers, but after the owners of these factories thoroughly confessed and expressed remorse, they immediately received consideration from the People's Government in the form of commissioned processing, ordering, or loans. The assistance from the People's Government deeply moved these capitalists. On the same day that the "Five-Anti" inspection team concluded its work at the Huafu Dyeing Factory, the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company called to inform them that they could be given more than 10,000 bolts of cloth for processing, and the joint state-private Jianye Bank also agreed to provide loans. The factory's capitalists stated that they are determined to improve production under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class in the future, and actively mobilize other colleagues to thoroughly confess. Some capitalists who have received government assistance have also worked with their employees to develop production plans to improve production and complete state processing and ordering tasks.

The signing of new processing and ordering contracts demonstrates that new and normal public-private and labor-capital relations are growing. When new processing and ordering contracts are signed, relevant economic departments mostly convene meetings of capitalists and employees to announce the policies and content of processing and ordering, and then the capitalists quote prices, with employees participating in the review. Some departments and private factories have established "earmarked funds for special purposes" and "special materials for special purposes" systems when signing contracts: factories accepting processing and ordering must deposit the deposit or processing fees into the People's Bank and open a special account. The capitalist must obtain the consent of the trade union when using the funds; the use of materials allocated for processing must also be approved by the trade union. Some private factory employees have automatically established organizations to inspect finished products and review costs to prevent capitalists from cutting corners and deceiving the government. For example, the Shanghai Pencil Factory employees have established a production cost research group, specifically responsible for researching production costs, technological improvements, and finished product inspection. In the past, due to capitalists cutting corners, pencil leads were easily broken, but this has now been improved. Employees of the Zhonghua Iron Factory have established a cost estimation committee to supervise capitalists to honestly calculate costs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海市人民政府帮助消除“五毒”的资本家发展生产
    在“五反”斗争连续取得胜利的形势下，上海市人民政府继续扩大对私营工商业的加工、定货、收购和放款工作，帮助有利于国计民生的私营工业在除掉“五毒”后健康地发展生产。四月上半月内，上海市已有包括三十四个行业的三千多家私营厂商受到人民政府的扶助，生产指数因此比上月有显著的提高。据上海市税务局统计：四月一日到四月十一日所收货物税比上月同期增加百分之二十四点五五。
    这些被扶助的私营厂商中，有许多是严重违法户，但这些工厂的老板在彻底坦白表示悔过后，立刻得到人民政府委托加工、定货或贷款的照顾。人民政府的扶助，使这些资本家深深感动。华福染厂在“五反”检查队结束工作的当天，国营花纱布公司便来电话通知可以给予一万多疋布加工，公私合营建业银行也答应给予贷款。该厂资方表示今后决心在国营经济和工人阶级领导下搞好生产，并积极动员其他同业彻底坦白。有些得到政府扶助的资本家，并已同职工在一起订出改进生产和完成国家加工定货任务的生产计划。
    新的加工定货合同的订立，显示出新的正常的公私关系和劳资关系正在成长起来。新的加工定货合同订立时，有关经济部门大多召开了资方会议和职工会议，宣布加工定货的政策和内容，然后由资方报价，职工参加审查。有些部门和私营工厂订立合同时确立了“专款专用”和“专料专用”制度：接受加工定货的工厂必须将定金或工缴费存入人民银行，开立专户，资方动用时，必须经过工会的证明同意；加工所拨物料的使用，也同样要经工会证明同意。有些私营工厂职工自动成立了检验成品的组织和审查成本的组织，以防止资方再偷工减料、欺骗政府。如上海铅笔厂职工已成立了生产成本研究组，专门负责研究生产成本、技术改进和成品检验工作。过去因资方偷工减料，铅芯容易折断，现在已加以改进。中华铁工厂职工已成立了估工委员会，以监督资方老老实实地计算成本。（新华社）
