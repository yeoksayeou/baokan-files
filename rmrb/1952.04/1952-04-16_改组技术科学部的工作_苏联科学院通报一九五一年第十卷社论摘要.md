    Reorganizing the Work of the Department of Technical Sciences
    -- Summary of the Editorial from the Bulletin of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Vol. 10, 1951
    Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, our country has created the world's most advanced science. Stalin said that the science that is called advanced, "does not isolate itself from the people, does not stand far from the people, but is determined to serve the people, is determined to give all its achievements to the people, and it serves the people not out of necessity, but voluntarily and willingly."
    Soviet science faithfully serves the people. Scientific workers actively participate in the struggle to achieve the continuous upsurge of industry and agriculture in socialist countries. In his report commemorating the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Beria pointed out that "All our achievements are largely due to Soviet science. In recent years, our scientists have solved many problems of great value to our national economy and national defense. In many fields of learning, our scientists have taken the lead in promoting the development of world science."
    Subordinating its work to the tasks of communist construction, and enriching the practice of this unprecedented great construction in history with the latest scientific achievements and discoveries, Soviet scientists are also enriching themselves with the experience of construction, engaging in bold scientific summarization, thereby promoting the great development of Soviet science.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that theory and practice must be one goal, that theory must develop in close connection with practice, serve practice, answer questions raised by practice, be corrected by the materials of practice, and illuminate the path of practice. In this unity of theory and practice – which is one of the most obvious manifestations of cooperation between science and production – lies the invincible strength of Soviet science.
    The cooperation between science and production, which began in the early years of the Great October Socialist Revolution and has been continuously strengthened due to the constant care and assistance of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and Stalin himself, has created unlimited possibilities for the progress of science in the Soviet Union. At the same time, applying the achievements of science to practice ensures the continuous technical progress of our national economy, which is developing on a scientific basis.
    The connection between science and production has been particularly strengthened in recent years, during the years of implementing the great Stalin plan to transform our nature, which is an important link in a series of measures to create the material and technical foundation of communist society. The power of this connection is very evident in the assistance of scientists to the great communist construction. In the construction areas, many scientific expeditions assist practical workers in studying plans, investigating the possibility of rationally utilizing local raw materials for construction, and discovering more effective ways to develop the productive forces of these areas. Many scientific groups are working in their research institutes and laboratories to study issues related to solving the practical tasks of construction. Many research projects are being carried out jointly by scientific institutions and industrial enterprises. Almost all academies of sciences have organized great construction promotion committees. In these committees, many important scientists and practical workers jointly discuss and solve problems related to assisting the construction of hydropower stations and canals.
    Life requires that the main attention of all Soviet scientists and scientific research institutions be focused on solving those problems that are important for practice and for our national economy.
    However, as the People's Daily editorial of September 17, 1951, pointed out, "Not all scientific institutions actively participate in the study of practical scientific problems that are of great significance to the development of industry and agriculture. Some academies are divorced from practice, lag behind life, and waste manpower and material resources on the study of minor, secondary topics." Here, the editorial points out the serious shortcomings in the work of the scientific institutions of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    The leading center of the Department of Technical Sciences is its administration bureau. It is this bureau that should ensure that the work of all the department's institutions is close to the needs of the national economy. It is this bureau that should direct its work and its main research towards solving the most important problems. The administration bureau has failed to fulfill its main responsibility.
    The Department of Technical Sciences has not actually engaged in the planning of scientific work. Its institutions only formally compile the plans sent by the academies, without analyzing them, without collecting suggestions on adding new practical topics or removing secondary topics. At the meetings of the administration bureau to review the plans, representatives of industry are usually not invited. The administration bureau has not given due attention to the direction of the work, which is one of the main reasons why the forces of the department's academies have not been concentrated on solving the most important problems.
    The administration bureau has failed to ensure the correct development of many institutions in the department, such as the Institute of Machine Principles, the Institute of Automation and Remote Mechanics, and the Institute of Power. These academies have failed to thoroughly understand their tasks, have been divorced from life, have been divorced from practice, have not thought of or have forgotten that their responsibility is to help practice, and the necessity of organizing these academies is determined by the requirements of practice.
    The reason for the backwardness of most of the academies of the Department of Technical Sciences is that scientific forces are dispersed on many topics, research work is not concentrated on the most important directions, practical topics are studied for too long, and the results of this research are not applied to the national economy.
    In order to eliminate these shortcomings, it is necessary to fundamentally reorganize the work of the entire Department of Technical Sciences and its affiliated institutions.
    ×　　　×　　　×
    First, the reorganization work must involve the selection of scientific research topics. The practice of socialist construction places many tasks before science, which are being solved by our various scientific institutions. Naturally, those more important and fundamental issues fall within the responsibility of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In order to determine which issues should be studied by the Academy of Sciences, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the situation of modern science and technology, and to have a deep knowledge of practice and its requirements. Only through extensive discussion of issues among scientists and practical workers, and through discussion and debate of opinions, can science and practice be combined. Only under these conditions can we hope to correctly determine the important issues that should be studied by the Academy of Sciences.
    But in fact, these conditions are far from being observed at all times. Sometimes a scientific worker proposes a research topic, not considering its importance to the national economy, but hoping to continue his previous research, even though this research is not practical. The leaders of the academies and their scientific committees are not always determined to make such scientists "sad," and if criticism and self-criticism in the academies do not reach the required level, then the topic is included in the plan, which allows secondary topics to seep into the plan, which leads to the phenomenon of a large number of topics. These phenomena should no longer be allowed to exist. The People's Daily's instruction that attention must be concentrated on those issues that are of great significance to the national economy applies first and foremost to scientific planning.
    Scientific planning must begin with a deep study of the national economic plan, and on this basis reveal the most important directions of scientific research. At this point, it is of particular significance to initially determine the directions and basic research outlines from above, by the guidance and scientific committees of the academies, the administration bureaus of the departments, the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, with the active participation of leaders of industry and agriculture and production innovators.
    Representatives of industry and agriculture must be involved in the planning work and the subsequent steps. Until now, cooperation with industry in formulating plans has mostly been formal: the academies send the plans to the ministries, receive some written conclusions, some suggestions are adopted, while those suggestions that require overcoming serious difficulties—such as changing the structure of the academy, preparing new cadres—are rejected. Now we must begin to solicit opinions from industry when formulating plans. Of course, we cannot just rely on the existing institutions and existing cadres of the academies to select topics. New laboratories and new academies need to be established, and past institutions need to be changed if necessary for studying practical problems. Qualified new scientific workers should be absorbed and trained if the existing ones are not enough.
    Only by correctly establishing research work according to the plan will the entire academy know what is required of it and how it should organize its work. The reason why the Institute of Automation and Remote Mechanics has not been able to find its own responsibility in solving the task of automating the hydropower stations being built on the Volga River and the Dnieper River is that its plan was formulated in the office, without consulting other institutions that are already working in this area, and without studying their experience. And now the institute is mistakenly delaying the convening of a meeting of relevant institutions, which will definitely bring clarity to the plan for its future work.
    The task of studying important scientific problems in industry and agriculture raises the issue of coordination in all aspects. For example, it is clear that the strength of one academy alone cannot grasp all the main problems of Soviet machine manufacturing. Therefore, the Institute of Machine Principles must absorb other academies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Union Republics, and industry to comprehensively and deeply study these problems. Without the participation of the Institute of Automation and Remote Mechanics, which studies the principles of automatic machines, it is impossible to form the scientific basis for the automation of the machine manufacturing industry. Without the participation of metallurgists, the Institute of Machine Principles cannot conduct research on the use of new materials on machines.
    The same applies to other academies of the Department of Technical Sciences. In order to study scientific problems of great national economic significance—problems that the institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have a responsibility to study—the work of the relevant academies must be widely coordinated, and practical workers and experts from the relevant industrial departments must be absorbed into their work.
    It is necessary to completely readjust the connection between the academies and industry. The work of the academies of the Department of Technical Sciences cannot be reorganized without fundamentally changing the form of this connection. The People's Daily said in its editorial: "The regular connection between scientific institutions and production is a reliable guarantee for the smooth development of science and technology." Therefore, this connection must not be formal or accidental, but organic and regular. Unfortunately, not everyone understands this. For example, there are some plans that attempt to re-examine research outlines solely on their own, without carefully studying the experience and requirements of industry. These are worthless attempts. The leaders of scientific institutions and all scientific workers should be familiar with the situation in industry, participate in the work of the technical committees of government ministries, and often go to enterprises to study their needs in order to select problems to study, the solutions to which are truly related to the interests of the relevant industrial departments.
    In order to have closer ties with production, technical committees composed of representatives from industry can be more effectively established in some academies. This will greatly help to improve the planning work and the application of research results to practical work, and will ensure regular contact with industry.
    One of the important tasks of the reorganization work is to implement the instruction of the People's Daily that the Department of Technical Sciences and its affiliated scientific research institutions must become advocates in the facts of further technological progress. This task cannot be solved without extensively summarizing the experience of industry. Every scientific staff member in every laboratory and academy should be systematically and regularly familiarized with the work of each enterprise on the spot, and meetings should be jointly organized with industrial representatives in a planned manner in accordance with the various aspects of technical science. The most important responsibility of the institutions of the Academy of Sciences is to summarize the experience of industry, and the result of this summarization must be profound scientific conclusions about the tasks and prospects of industrial development. Without this, it is impossible to correctly draw up scientific research outlines, it is impossible to give real assistance to practice, and without this, one will inevitably be divorced from practice.
    ×　　　　×　　　　×
    In its resolution of September 28, 1951, the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences ordered the administration bureau of the Department of Technical Sciences to ensure the fundamental reorganization of the work of the department's institutions in order to achieve the goal of using forces to study the main problems of our national economy. The resolution emphasized that the administration bureau should pay special attention to providing scientific assistance to the great communist construction.
    At the same time, the Presidium pointed out to the deans and leaders of many academies the necessity of improving the leadership work of each academy. There is no doubt that the administration bureau of the Department of Technical Sciences and the guidance and scientific committees of these institutions should be primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the work of the institutions under the Department of Technical Sciences. The Presidium has taken a series of measures aimed at strengthening the leadership of the academies of the department, and has given the administration bureau of the department and the deans of the academies specific instructions on reorganization methods. It is possible that in the middle of the reorganization, it is necessary to violate the wishes of some scientific workers, especially those who have long been engaged in unimportant issues and do not serve the national economy with their work. It is possible to disregard the wishes of some people; individual laboratories must be closed, or the direction of their work must be substantially changed. Naturally, some new cadres need to be absorbed. The task is to adapt the organizational outline and personnel allocation of the department's academies to the requirements raised by our national economy to the scientific institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    The most important condition for successful reorganization is to widely carry out criticism and self-criticism in the institutions of the Department of Technical Sciences. Unfortunately, criticism and self-criticism have not become the basis of their work. The Department of Technical Sciences and its academies have not drawn due conclusions from Stalin's instruction on the role of criticism and debate of opinions for the development of science, which is one of the important reasons for their poor work.
    It should be understood that without widely carrying out criticism and self-criticism, no reorganization, no smooth work is possible. Criticism and debate of opinions should become the regular working method of the discussion meetings, scientific committees, and various meetings of the academies. It is particularly important to involve representatives of industry and scientific research institutions of various ministries in the discussion of principled issues. We must relentlessly fight against all attempts to suppress criticism, no matter what form these attempts take.
    The Presidium of the Academy of Sciences wants the administration bureau of the Department of Technical Sciences to pay attention to the necessity of fully strengthening criticism and self-criticism in the work of the administration bureau and the institutions of the department.
    At the same time, the resolution of the Presidium ordered the administration bureau to give constant concern to the Marxist-Leninist education of scientific cadres and to improve the ideological and theoretical level of cadres. In the past, little attention was paid to ideological work in the institutions of the department. The Presidium's instruction on organizing philosophical and methodological discussion meetings in the academies has not been implemented. Such discussion meetings have only been organized in the Institute of Mechanics.
    The weakness of the development of criticism and self-criticism, and the low level of ideological work, have determined the academies' lagging behind life and the lack of purpose in their research work.
    Only by resolutely removing the roots of these shortcomings in our own work—shortcomings about which the People's Daily has issued a warning—only by fundamentally reorganizing our own work in the spirit of the People's Daily's instructions, can the technical academies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences become true advocates in the cause of further technological progress in our country, and become powerful participants in the great communist construction.
    The scientists of the Soviet Academy of Sciences widely discussed the editorial of the People's Daily of September 17, 1951, and the subsequent resolution of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the scientific work of the institutions under the Department of Technical Sciences.
    The People's Daily's editorial and the resolution of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the work of the institutions under the Department of Technical Sciences will inevitably become the beginning of mobilization in the reorganization of the work of the academies, in further improving their scientific research work, and in strengthening their connection with production.
    Stalin instructed: "...Our country, with its revolutionary habits and traditions, and its struggle against ideological conservatism and stagnation, provides very favorable conditions for the prosperity of science."
    The responsibility of the scientists of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who have all the conditions for scientific creation, is to work more effectively for the motherland, for the further strengthening of the motherland's strength. (Translated by Li Ya)

    改组技术科学部的工作
    ——苏联科学院通报一九五一年第十卷社论摘要
    我国在列宁—斯大林党的领导下，创造了世界上最先进的科学。斯大林说，被称为先进的那个科学，“它不与人民隔绝，不远远离开人民，而决意服务于人民，决意把自己的一切成果交给人民，它并非由于迫不得已，而是自愿和乐意服务于人民。”
    苏联科学忠实地服务于人民。科学工作者积极参加为争取社会主义国家工业和农业不断高涨的斗争。贝利亚在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年的报告中指出，“我们所有的成就，在很大程度上应归功于苏联的科学。近几年来，我国科学家已解决了许多对我国国民经济和国防有极重大价值的问题。在许多学问方面，我国科学家在促进世界科学的发展上都占了首席地位。”
    把自己的工作服从于共产主义建设的任务，以最新的科学成就和发现丰富着这个历史上空前的伟大建设的实践，苏联科学家也正以建设的经验丰富着自己，从事于勇敢的科学的总结，从而促进苏联科学的巨大的发展。
    马列主义教导说，理论和实践必须是一个目的，理论必须在和实践的密切联系中发展，服务于实践，回答由实践所引起的问题，为实践的材料所校正，照耀实践的道路。在这个理论和实践的统一里——这种统一是科学和生产合作的最明显的表现之一——存在着苏联科学不可战胜的力量。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命的最初年代中所开始的，并由于布尔什维克党、苏联政府及斯大林本人的经常关怀和协助而不断加强起来的科学与生产的合作，给科学在苏联的进步造成了无限的可能性。同时把科学的成就应用到实践中去，保证了在科学基础上发展着的我们国民经济的不断的技术进步。
    科学和生产的联系在最近几年中，在执行改造我国自然的伟大斯大林计划的年代中特别加强了，这个计划是创造共产主义社会物质技术基础的一系列办法中重要环节之一。这个联系的力量非常明显地表现在科学家对于伟大共产主义建设的协助上。在建筑区的许多科学考察队协助实际工作者研究计划，考察合理利用当地原料供建筑之用的可能性，发现这些地区发展生产力的更有效的途径。许多科学家团体正在他们的研究院和实验室里从事研究有关解决建设的实际任务的问题。许多研究工作是由科学机关和工业企业共同进行的。差不多在所有科学院的下面都组织了伟大建设促进委员会。在这些委员会里，许多重要的科学家和实际工作者在共同讨论并解决协助建设水电站和运河的问题。
    生活要求所有苏联科学家和科学研究机关的主要注意力都集中在解决那些对于实践、对于我国国民经济都是重要的问题。
    但是，正如真理报一九五一年九月十七日的社论中所指出的，“并非所有科学机关都积极参加研究那些和工业及农业的发展有重大意义的实际科学问题。有些学院脱离了实践，落在生活的后面，把人力、物力耗费在研究细小的、次要的题目上。”这里，社论指出苏联科学院技术科学部各科学机关工作中的严重缺点。
    技术科学部的领导中心就是它的管理局。正是这个局应当保证该部所有各机关的工作接近于国民经济的要求。正是这个局应当将其工作、其主要的研究引向解决最重要的问题。管理局未能完成它这个主要的职责。
    技术科学部实质上并未从事科学工作的计划。它的机构只形式地把各学院送来的计划汇合在一起，不去分析它们，不搜集关于增加新的实际题目或去掉次要题目的建议。在管理局审查计划的会议上，工业的代表照例没有被吸收进来。管理局对于工作的方针未加以应有的注意，这就是使该部各学院的力量未集中在解决最重要问题上的主要原因之一。
    管理局未能保证该部许多机关如机器原理学院、自动和远距离机械学院、动力学院的正确发展。这些学院未能彻底了解它们的任务，脱离了生活，脱离了实践，没有想到或是忘记了它们的责任就是帮助实践，而组织这些学院的必要是由实践的要求来决定的。
    技术科学部大多数学院落后的原因都是由于：科学力量分散在许多题目上，研究工作没有集中在最重要的方向上，实际的题目研究得太久，而且这种研究的结果没有应用到国民经济中去。
    为了去掉这些缺点，必须根本改组整个技术科学部及其所属机关的工作。
    ×　　　×　　　×
    首先，改组工作必须涉及到科学研究题目的选择。社会主义建设的实践摆在科学面前许多任务，正由我国各种科学机关在解决着。落在苏联科学院责任之内的自然是那些较重要的、具有原则性的问题。为了确定那些问题应由科学院研究，必需全面地分析现代科学及技术的情况，需要关于实践及其要求的深刻知识。只有在科学家及实际工作者中间广泛讨论问题，通过讨论及意见的争论，才能把科学和实践结合起来。只有在这种条件下，才能希望正确地确定那些应由科学院研究的重要问题。
    但是事实上，这些条件远非任何时候都被遵守着。有时科学工作者提出一个研究的题目，并非考虑到它对国民经济的重要性，而是希望继续他以前所开始的研究，虽然这些研究并不实际。各学院的领导者和他们下面的科学委员会并不是常常决定使这种科学家“难过”，而且假使在学院中批评和自我批评未达到应有的水平，于是这个题目就列入计划，这样就使次要的题目渗入计划中来，这样就出现了题目繁多的现象。对于这些现象再也不应该允许其存在了。真理报关于必须集中注意力于那些对国民经济有重要意义的问题的指示，首先就涉及到科学的计划。
    科学计划必须以深刻研究国民经济计划，并在此基础上揭示出科学研究的最重要的方向为起点。在这一点上，具有特殊意义的是从上面，由各学院的指导及科学委员会，各部的管理局，苏联科学院的主席团，在工业和农业的领导人员及生产革新者的积极参加之下，初步确定方针及基本研究提纲。
    必须把工业及农业的代表吸收到计划工作以及其后的各步工作中来。到现在为止，和工业方面协同定计划在大多数情况下尚只是形式的：学院把计划送到各部，收到一些书面结论，有些建议被采纳了，而对于那些需要克服严重困难的建议——如改变学院机构，准备新干部——则加以拒绝。现在必须开始在制订计划时和工业方面发出通知书征求意见。当然，不能就依赖各学院现存的机构及现有干部来选择题目。需要成立新的实验室，新的学院，假如为了研究实际问题有必要时，则改变过去的机构。应该吸收并培养具备条件的新的科学工作者，假如现有的不够的话。
    只有按照计划正确建立起研究工作，整个学院才会知道向它要求的是什么，它应当如何组织其工作。自动和远距离机械学院之所以未能在解决正在伏尔加河及德聂伯河建设着的水电站自动化的任务上找到其自己的责任，就是因为它的计划是在办公室中制订的，没有和已经在这方面工作的其他机关协商，没有研究它们的经验。而现在该院错误地迟迟不召开有关机关的会议，这个会议一定会给它今后工作的计划带来明确性。
    研究工业和农业重要科学问题的任务，特别尖锐地提出了各方面配合的问题。例如很明显仅仅一个学院的力量不可能掌握苏联机器制造业的所有主要问题。因此机器原理学院必须吸收苏联科学院、加盟共和国及工业方面的其他学院来全面深刻地研究这些问题。没有研究自动机器原理的自动和远距离机械学院的参加，就不可能形成机器制造工业自动化的科学基础。没有冶金学家的参加，机器原理学院就不能进行在机器上采用新材料方面的研究。
    上面所说的同样关系着技术科学部的其他学院。为了研究具有重大国民经济意义的科学问题——苏联科学院各机关有责任来研究这些问题——必须将有关各学院的工作加以广泛的配合，将有关工业部门的实际工作者和专家吸收到其工作中来。
    必须完全重新调整各学院和工业的联系，不根本改变这个联系的形式，就不能改组技术科学部各学院的工作。真理报在社论中说：“科学机关和生产的经常联系是科学和技术顺利发展的可靠保证。”因此这个联系一定不能是形式的、偶然的，而是有机的经常的。可惜的是并非所有的人都明白这一点。例如，有这样一些打算，企图只以自己的力量来重新审查研究提纲，而不去仔细研究工业的经验和要求。这是些没有价值的企图，科学机关的领导人以及所有科学工作者都应该熟悉工业中的情况，参加政府各部技术委员会的工作，时常到企业中去，研究它们的需要，以便选择出问题来研究，这些问题的解决真正关系着各该工业部门的利益。
    为了和生产更紧密的联系，在若干学院中可以更有效地由工业中的代表组成技术委员会。这将会大大有利于改善计划工作以及将研究成果应用于实际的工作，并将保证和工业方面的经常联系。
    改组工作重要任务之一就是实现真理报的那个指示，即技术科学部及其所属科学研究机关必须在进一步技术进步的事实中成为倡导者。不广泛进行总结工业经验的工作，这项任务是不能解决的。应当有系统地使每个实验室及学院的每一科学工作人员经常就地熟悉各企业的工作，应当按照技术科学的各方面和工业代表有计划地共同组织会议。科学院各机关最重要的责任就是总结工业的经验，这种总结的结果必然是关于工业发展的任务和前途的深刻的科学结论。没有这一点就不能正确地拟出科学研究的提纲，就不能对实践给予真正的协助，没有这一点就必然会脱离实践。
    ×　　　　×　　　　×
    科学院主席团在其一九五一年九月二十八日的决议中命令技术科学部的管理局保证根本改组该部各机关的工作，以达到将力量用于研究我国国民经济主要问题的目的。决议中强调指出管理局应该特别注意对伟大共产主义建设给与科学帮助。
    同时主席团对许多学院的院长和领导人员指出改善各该学院领导工作的必要性。毫无疑问，对技术科学院所属各机关工作中的缺点，首先应该负责的是该部的管理局和这些机关的指导及科学委员会。主席团采取了一系列旨在加强该部各学院领导的办法，并给与该部管理局、各学院院长以有关改组方法的具体指示。可能在改组中间必须违反若干科学工作者，特别是那些长期从事于不重要问题并且不将自己的工作服务于国民经济的人的愿望。可能同样不顾有些人的愿望；个别实验室必须关闭，或者在实质上改变其工作的方针。自然需要吸收一些新的干部。任务在于把该部各学院的机构轮廓及人员的配置适合于我国国民经济提向苏联科学院各科学机关的要求。
    成功改组的最重要的条件就是在技术科学部各机关中广泛开展批评和自我批评。可惜的是，批评和自我批评还没有成为它们工作的基础。技术科学部及其各学院尚未从斯大林关于批评和意见的争论对于科学发展的作用这一指示中得出应有的结论，这一点是它们工作不好的重要原因之一。
    应该了解，不广泛开展批评和自我批评，任何改组，任何顺利的工作都是不可能的。批评和意见的争论应该成为各学院讨论会、科学委员会及各种会议的经常的工作方法。特别重要的是在讨论原则性问题的时候吸收工业及各部科学研究机关的代表参加。要无情地和各种压制批评的企图作斗争，不管这些企图是用什么形式表现出来。
    科学院主席团要技术科学部管理局注意在管理局及该部各机构的工作中全力加强批评和自我批评之必要性。
    同时主席团的决议命令管理局对于科学干部的马克思列宁主义教育，对于提高干部思想理论水平，给与经常的关心。在该部各机关中，过去很少注意思想工作。主席团关于在各学院中组织哲学方法论的讨论会的指示也没有实行。这种讨论会只在机械学院曾经组织过。
    批评和自我批评发展的薄弱，思想工作水平的低下，决定了各学院落后于生活，以及其研究工作的缺乏目的性。
    只有坚决去掉在自己工作中的这些缺点的根源—关于这些缺点真理报已发出警号——只有根据真理报指示的精神根本改组自己的工作，苏联科学院的各技术学院才能成为我国进一步技术进步事业中的真正倡导者，才能成为伟大共产主义建设的有力的参加者。
    苏联科学院的科学家们广泛讨论了一九五一年九月十七日真理报的社论，以及其后苏联科学院关于技术科学部各机关科学工作的决议。
    真理报的社论和苏联科学院关于技术科学部所属各机关的工作的决议，必然在各学院工作的改组中，在进一步提高其科学研究工作及加强其与生产的联系上，成为动员的开始。
    斯大林指示说：“……我们的国家，连同其所具有的革命的习惯和传统，及其反对思想的保守与停滞的斗争：给科学的繁荣提供了非常有利的条件。”
    具有科学创造全部条件的苏联科学院的科学家们的责任就是为了祖国力量进一步的加强，更有效地为祖国工作。　　　　　　　　（李亚译）
