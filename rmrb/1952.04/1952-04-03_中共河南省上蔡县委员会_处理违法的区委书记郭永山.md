    CCP Henan Province, Shangcai County Committee
    Handles Illegal District Committee Secretary Guo Yongshan

    Editor: The reader's letter published in the People's Daily on February 8th exposed the crimes of Guo Yongshan, the Secretary of the Seventh District Committee of our county, in violating laws and discipline. We have investigated and dealt with this matter. The materials reported by the reader are basically correct. After we had mastered all the materials of Guo Yongshan's crimes, we transferred Guo Yongshan to the county committee office for introspection. However, Guo Yongshan consistently refused to thoroughly confess and passively resisted, and finally absconded in fear of punishment on March 14th. The next day, Guo Yongshan was captured and brought to justice. We believe that Guo Yongshan's mistakes are serious. We have decided to report to the higher party organization for approval to expel Guo Yongshan from the Party and suggest that the relevant administrative departments remove Guo Yongshan from his post and send him to the court for legal action.

    中共河南省上蔡县委员会
    处理违法的区委书记郭永山
    编辑同志： 二月八日人民日报登载的读者来信，揭发了我县第七区区委书记郭永山违法乱纪的罪行。我们已对此事进行调查处理。读者所检举的材料，基本上是正确的。我们掌握了郭永山罪行的全部材料后，即调郭永山到县委机关反省。可是，郭永山始终不肯彻底坦白并消极对抗，最后竟于三月十四日畏罪潜逃。第二天，郭永山被缉拿归案。我们认为郭永山的错误是严重的。我们已决定报请上级党组织批准开除郭永山的党籍，并建议有关行政部门撤消郭永山的职务，送法院法办。
