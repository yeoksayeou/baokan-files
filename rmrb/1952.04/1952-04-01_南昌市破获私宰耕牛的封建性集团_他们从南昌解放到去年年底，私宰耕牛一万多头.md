    Nanchang City Smashes Feudal Clique Illegally Slaughtering Oxen
    They Illegally Slaughtered More Than 10,000 Head of Oxen from the Liberation of Nanchang to the End of Last Year
    Nanchang City recently uncovered a major case involving the illegal slaughter of oxen by the "Nine Marks Slaughterhouse" group. The Nine Marks Slaughterhouse was formed by the collective investment of nine slaughterhouse owners in Nanchang City, and was a feudalistic illegal ox-slaughtering group. This group was secretly formed as early as June 1949, and in the spring of 1951, they obtained a legal name under the guise of a joint venture. According to the materials currently uncovered, from the liberation of Nanchang City to the end of last year, the Nine Marks Slaughterhouse奸商 [treacherous merchants] had illegally slaughtered more than 10,000 head of oxen.
    In order to achieve their goal of illegally slaughtering oxen, the Nine Marks Slaughterhouse, in addition to setting up the slaughterhouse in a relatively remote area in the suburbs, also used various methods to conceal their illegal activities. Their internal organization was very tight, and personnel inside the slaughterhouse were prohibited from asking each other about the slaughtering situation, and they threatened employees not to leak any information. Hu Dongjie, who used to work as a slaughterer in the slaughterhouse and is now a school guard at Nanchang University, said: "When I left the slaughterhouse, Jia Shoushan said to me: 'If you let the government know about our illegal slaughter after you leave, I will kill you.'" They also won over inspection personnel. From the spring of 1950, they bribed Hu Houmao, the cadre in charge of inspection from the Nanchang Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, with 30 silver dollars every day. In the winter of 1950, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government uncovered a case of illegal ox slaughter by this group, but because of its tight internal organization, the entire case could not be solved. At that time, Jia Shoushan instructed his henchmen, Deng Jingen and Huang Jingen, to turn themselves in to mislead the government and prevent the government from continuing to investigate the entire case.
    The Nine Marks Slaughterhouse illegally slaughtered oxen in the dead of night. During the illegal slaughter, they set up "sentry posts" around the slaughterhouse and stipulated a communication code for when inspection personnel were discovered. Cheng Jianzhong, a worker who had guarded a "sentry post" at the slaughterhouse for two years, said: "Every night I guarded for more than two hours. When guarding the sentry post, if I found inspection personnel coming, I would use a flashlight as a signal, and the people inside would hide the illegally slaughtered oxen." After they slaughtered the oxen in the dead of night, the hides, bones, and beef were all sold in an organized manner. They had exclusive contracts with many leather workshops and bone shops to sell the hides and bones to these workshops. They also organized more than 150 beef vendors to sell the beef they illegally slaughtered.
    The losses to the country caused by the Nine Marks Slaughterhouse illegally slaughtering oxen are staggering, with tax evasion alone amounting to 1.7 billion yuan. They illegally sold a large number of hides, undermining the People's Government's regulations on the unified purchase of hides. In particular, they purchased a large number of oxen in rural areas, undermining rural productivity, and the losses caused by this are incalculable.
    After the anti-theft struggle began in Nanchang City, Jia Shoushan, the leader of this group, burned his account books in an attempt to resist. The bosses of the nine slaughterhouses collectively formed an "offensive and defensive alliance," threatening workers who reported them and preparing to resist to the end. But all their struggles were in vain, and all their crimes were reported by the workers of the slaughterhouse. Based on the materials reported by the workers, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government has arrested Jia Shoushan, the principal offender of this illegal ox-slaughtering group.

    南昌市破获私宰耕牛的封建性集团
    他们从南昌解放到去年年底，私宰耕牛一万多头
    南昌市最近破获了九记屠牛场非法屠宰耕牛的巨案。九记屠牛场是南昌市九家屠牛商集资组成的，它是一个封建性的私宰耕牛集团。这个集团早在一九四九年六月就已秘密组成，一九五一年春，他们借联营为名取得了合法的名称。据目前已查获的材料，从南昌市解放到去年年底止，九记屠牛场奸商私宰的耕牛已达一万多头。
    九记屠牛场为了达到他们私宰耕牛的目的，除了把屠牛场设在市郊较冷僻的地方外，还用各种办法来隐蔽他们的非法活动。他们的内部组织非常严密，场内人员禁止互相过问宰杀情况，并威胁职工不准走漏消息。现在在南昌大学做校警、曾经在该场做过宰牛工人的胡冬孑说：“我在离开屠牛场时，贾寿山对我说：你出去后如果让政府知道了我们的私宰，就把你杀掉。”他们还拉拢查验人员。从一九五零年春天起，他们每天以银元三十元贿赂南昌市人民政府建设局负责查验的干部胡厚茂。一九五零年冬，南昌市人民政府曾破获这个集团的私宰耕牛案一起，但由于其内部组织严密，未能全部破案。当时贾寿山指示其党羽邓金根、黄金根投案自首，以蒙骗政府，使政府不再继续追查全案。
    九记屠牛场私宰耕牛都是在深夜进行的。私宰时，他们在牛场周围设有“哨口”，并规定了发现查验人员时的通讯暗号。一个曾经在该场守过二年“哨口”的工人乘建中说：“每日晚间我都守二小时以上。守哨时如果发现检查人员来时，即以放射手电筒为暗号，里面就把私宰的耕牛藏起来。”他们在深夜把耕牛宰杀后，牛皮、牛骨、牛肉都是有组织地出售的，他们和许多家牛皮坊及料骨店订有专利合同，将牛皮和牛骨卖给这些坊店。他们又将一百五十多个牛肉商贩组织起来，专门销售他们私宰的牛肉。
    九记屠牛场私宰耕牛所给予国家的损失是惊人的，单是偷税一项就达十七亿元。他们大量地私销牛皮，破坏了人民政府对牛皮实行统购的规定。特别是他们在农村中大量收购耕牛，破坏了农村生产力，由此造成的损失是无法计算的。
    南昌市反盗窃斗争开始后，这个集团的首领贾寿山烧毁账簿，企图顽抗。九家屠牛场的老板集体订立了“攻守同盟”，威胁检举他们的工人，准备抵抗到底。但是他们的一切挣扎都归徒然，全部罪行还是被屠牛场的工人检举出来。南昌市人民政府根据工人的检举材料，已将这个私宰耕牛集团的首犯贾寿山逮捕。　（新华社）
