    Rely on the Working Class to Reasonably Calculate Processing Costs

    The Shenyang Regional Wholesale Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company recently entrusted a large quantity of processing work to private textile and dyeing factories. Before entrusting the processing, they held meetings with the chairmen of trade associations, managers of various factories, and representatives of trade unions of various factories, by industry, to jointly study and calculate reasonable costs, changing the phenomenon of some capitalists falsely reporting costs in processing. For example, in the textile industry, there are more than 40 specifications for the amount of yarn used in processing cloth, which was generally reduced by 1.5 per thousand. As for the quota of dyes in the dyeing and finishing industry, calculated in cash, it was generally reduced by about 4,000 yuan per piece, and in some cases, it decreased by 8,453 yuan per piece.

    This method of jointly studying and calculating costs with worker representatives from private enterprises is a concrete manifestation of state-owned trading enterprises relying on the working class in entrusted processing. The workers have the clearest understanding of the amount of raw materials used and the specific production process. By extensively soliciting workers' opinions, costs can be calculated reasonably. At the same time, workers sending their own representatives to participate in the formulation of contracts enables them to play a more active role in production and supervise the implementation of contracts, strengthening their sense of responsibility, thus ensuring and improving the quality and specifications of products.

    The East China Regional State-Owned Trading Company has also adopted this method of formulating cost and expense rates and has achieved good results. State-owned trading enterprises in various regions should adopt this method when entrusting processing to private enterprises.

    依靠工人阶级合理计算加工成本
    中国花纱布公司沈阳地区批发站最近曾大量委托私营纺织、染整工厂加工。他们在委托加工之前，曾分别行业，和同业公会理事长、各工厂的经理、各工厂的工会代表开会，共同研究，计算出合理的成本，改变了某些资本家在加工中谎报成本的现象。如纺织业有四十多种规格的加工布匹的用纱量，一般地降低了千分之一点五。染整业染料的定额，如以现款计算：一般地每匹降低了四千元左右，有的每匹下降了八千四百五十三元。
    这种和私营企业工人代表共同研究计算成本的方法，是国营贸易企业在委托加工中依靠工人阶级的具体表现。工人们对原材料的用量和具体生产过程，是了解得最清楚的。广泛征求工人的意见，就可以合理地计算出成本。同时，工人们派自己的代表参加了制订合同，在生产过程中就更能发挥生产的积极性和对合同执行的监督作用，加强责任心，因而能保证和提高产品的质量和规格。
    这种制定成本费用率的方法，华东区国营贸易公司也已采用，并得到良好的效果。各地国营贸易企业在委托私营企业加工时都应该采用这个方法。
