    Shi Anfu Mutual Aid Team Initiates Wheat Production Increase Competition
    The nationally renowned wheat production model, Shi Anfu, a farmer from Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, and the mutual aid team he leads, today issued a challenge to mutual aid and cooperative organizations and farmers across the country who grow wheat, to hold a competition to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year. He calls on wheat farmers across the country to step up weeding and topdressing to increase the yield per unit area of wheat fields; this year, the competition will be based on this. When planting wheat this autumn, a comprehensive competition will be held to improve wheat planting technology and strive for a bumper wheat harvest. The Shi Anfu Mutual Aid Team consists of four households, who planted a total of 24 mu and 8 fen 7 of wheat last autumn, of which 7 mu and 9 fen 9 are irrigable wheat fields. The following is the challenge they issued.
    "To labor models and mutual aid cooperative organizations and farmers who grow wheat in wheat-producing areas across the country:
    In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year, we are determined to improve and gradually improve our newly organized mutual aid team, and strive to increase the yield of wheat fields through efforts such as processing and fertilization. We hope that everyone will participate in this competition to strive for a bumper wheat harvest. Our conditions are:
    1. This year, we guarantee that the yield per mu of irrigable wheat fields will reach 600 jin, of which Shi Anfu's 1 mu and 3 fen will reach 900 jin per mu; the yield per mu of dry land wheat fields will reach 300 jin.
    2. Wheat fields should be harrowed once in the spring, weeded three times, and the weeds pulled three times to ensure that the ground is free of weeds. Apply 20 carts of top dressing per mu, and apply 20 jin of ammonium sulfate (fertilizer powder) to irrigable wheat fields when heading. The whole team will work hard to ensure that water and dry land wheat fields are free from drought and pests; irrigable wheat fields should be irrigated in a timely manner.
    3. When harvesting wheat, carefully select wheat seeds, and select spikes in the field, threshing and harvesting them separately.
    4. The whole team will set aside more than two fen of wheat fields for experimentation, carefully study wheat planting technology, and promote our wheat planting experience to the whole village at any time to promote wheat production increase in the whole village.
    5. After the summer harvest, enthusiastically hand in patriotic public grain.

    史安福互助组发起小麦增产竞赛
    全国著名的小麦丰产模范陕西省韩城县农民史安福和他领导的互助组，今日发出挑战书，向全国种小麦的互助合作组织和农民挑战，为争取今年小麦丰收举行竞赛。他要求全国种小麦的农民，加紧进行锄草追肥，来提高麦田的单位面积产量；今年便在这个基础上进行竞赛。今年秋天种麦时，再作提高种麦技术、争取小麦丰收的全面竞赛。史安福互助组共四户，去秋共种小麦二十四亩八分七，其中七亩九分九是能够浇灌的麦田。以下就是他们发出的挑战书。
    “全国产麦区劳动模范、种麦的互助合作组织和农民弟兄们：
    为了争取今年小麦丰收，我们决心健全并逐步提高我们新组织起来的互助组，并以加工施肥等努力来提高麦田的产量，希望大家参加这个争取麦田丰收的竞赛。我们的条件是：
    一、今年，我们保证能浇灌的麦田每亩产量达到六百斤，其中史安福的一亩三分每亩产量达到九百斤；旱地麦田每亩产量达到三百斤。
    二、麦田要春耱一遍，锄草三遍，拔草三遍，做到地无杂草。每亩施追肥二十车，能浇灌的麦田在抽穗时增施硫酸錏（肥田粉）二十斤。全组努力保证水旱麦田不受旱，不受病虫害；能灌溉的麦田要适时浇灌。
    三、收麦时精选麦种，作到田间穗选，另打另收。
    四、全组辟出两分多麦田作试验，悉心研究种麦技术，并随时向全村推广我们的种麦经验，推动全村小麦增产。
    五、夏收后踊跃缴纳爱国公粮。
