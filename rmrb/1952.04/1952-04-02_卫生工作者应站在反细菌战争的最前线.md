    Health Workers Should Stand at the Forefront of the Anti-Bacterial Warfare
    Chen Wengui, Vice Chairman of the All-China Medical Association

    We, the health workers of China, with our loyalty to the motherland and the people, our love for peace, our spirit of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism, and our respect for science and justice, unanimously express our righteous indignation at the extremely brutal and savage crimes of U.S. imperialism in employing bacterial warfare in Korea and our Northeast. To such inhuman beasts, we can only give a head-on blow, defeat them utterly, and force them to bow their heads under the iron fists of the people. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of March 8th, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Fu Lianzhang's call, and actively take action to move to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. I am a plague expert, and my duty is to eliminate all the harms of the plague. I cannot sit idly by while American aggressors artificially create plague and other infectious diseases. I am about to rush to the front lines and do my best to fight for the complete smashing of U.S. imperialist bacterial warfare!

    In the Middle Ages, Europe experienced a terrifying "Black Death" epidemic, which killed many people. At that time, in the Dark Ages of Rome, people did not master scientific methods to eliminate bacteria. Therefore, this epidemic left a deep impression on the minds of the people of the world. But precisely because of this, it prompted countless scientific experts to devote their wisdom to the research and prevention of bacteria. Human health has gradually been guaranteed with the help of science, and the great epidemic of the "Black Death" has become a thing of the past in human history. This proves that the vast people who have the ability to overcome any natural resistance are the masters who create human happiness, and many righteous and kind scientists have also been praised by history. However, in the age of imperialism, financial oligarchs have attempted to usurp civilization and science as a means of killing for plunder and aggression. During the First World War, many signs proved that German fascists wanted to use bacterial warfare to save their failing fate, but their rapid defeat prevented their evil attempts from being realized. This educated many righteous and kind people that such arrogant plans of aggression must be effectively stopped. In June 1925, representatives from forty countries met in Geneva and jointly signed a protocol, clearly stipulating the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons in war. This is in line with the wishes of good people all over the world. However, the United States and Japan did not ratify this protocol. This symbolizes that unfortunate events will eventually occur. This unfortunate disaster was already inflicted on the heads of the Chinese people by Japanese bandits during World War II. Today, U.S. imperialism spreading bacteria in the front and rear of Korea and in our motherland's Northeast is not accidental, but has its historical origins. But the enemy's crime can only illustrate its weakness and does not represent its strength. Whether it is Japan or the United States, when they use poison gas and bacteria to fight, they have reached the stage of their death throes. Because using planes to fight planes, using artillery to bombard artillery, using bayonets to fight bayonets, the American aggressors are no match for the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces.

    But what is the use of bacterial warfare? Bacterial warfare is not as terrible as it is said to be. The enemy's attempt to use bacteria and insects to disrupt and sabotage our rear is simply a dream. Bacteria are, after all, bacteria, and they are the objects that our health workers want to eliminate. Many nurses and doctors eliminate bacteria every day; many experts and professors study ways to completely eliminate bacteria and insects every day. It only adds a layer of trouble to us, which is to fight bacteria more intensely. We want to warn the American bandits that the Chinese people of today are not growing up in the Dark Ages of ancient Rome, but are growing up in the era of Mao Zedong, which shines with dazzling light. Our motherland's people were able to defeat the Japanese bandits, build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, undertake the Huai River management project, and prevent and control the plague epidemic in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia. Don't we have enough strength to eliminate the enemy who uses bacteria and these tiny organisms?

    The patriotic enthusiasm and internationalist spirit of tens of thousands of medical and health science workers across the country who are enthusiastically signing up to join volunteer teams for epidemic prevention and inspection in Korea or actively participating in various effective epidemic prevention work in their posts is the excellent quality of righteous and kind medical and health science workers. We must act more actively. At present, we must first do a good job in preparing for epidemic prevention, enrich everyone's various epidemic prevention techniques and specialized knowledge, turn anger into strength, immediately launch propaganda to the broad masses of people, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of the fight against American bacterial warfare!

    卫生工作者应站在反细菌战争的最前线
    中华医学会总会副理事长　陈文贵
    我们中国卫生工作者，以对祖国和人民的忠诚，以对和平的热爱，以国际主义和革命人道主义的精神，以对科学和正义的尊重，对美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北等地采用极端残暴野蛮的细菌战的罪行，一致表示义愤填膺。对这种毫无人性的野兽，只有给以迎头痛击，打得它落花流水，迫使它在人民的铁拳下低头。我们坚决拥护周外长三月八日的声明，热烈响应傅连暲理事长的号召，积极行动起来，走上反细菌战的最前线。我是一个鼠疫专家，我的职责是要消灭一切鼠疫的危害，对美国侵略者人工制造鼠疫和其他传染病的阴谋绝不能坐视。我即将奔赴前线，竭尽我的知识能力，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义细菌战而斗争！
    远在中世纪时，欧洲曾发生过恐怖的“黑死病”传染，死亡的人民很多。当时在罗马黑暗时代，人民没有掌握科学的消灭细菌的方法，因此这次传染病在世界人民的心目中留下了一个深刻的印象。但正由于这样，却推动了无数科学专家竭尽他们的智慧，从事研究防治细菌的工作。人类的健康慢慢地在科学的帮助下得到保障，“黑死病”的大流行在人类的历史上已成过去。从这里可以证明，具有战胜任何自然阻力的广大人民是创造人类幸福的主宰，这里有许多正义的善良的科学家也得到了历史的赞扬。但是到了帝国主义时代，金融寡头们却为了掠夺和侵略，企图把文明、把科学篡窃作为杀人的手段。第一次世界大战时，从很多迹象中证明德国法西斯想利用细菌战争来挽回它的失败命运，但它的迅速失败，使得它的罪恶企图未能实现。这教育了很多正义和善良的人民，必须有效地制止这种侵略的狂妄计划。一九二五年六月，四十个国家的代表在日内瓦开会，共同签订了议定书，明确规定了禁止在战争中使用细菌武器的禁例。这是符合全世界善良人民的意愿的。但美国和日本对这一议定书却未予批准。这象征着不幸的事件，终究会要发生。这个不幸的灾难，在第二次世界大战时，已经由日本强盗加诸于中国人民的头上了。和平的中国人民遭受了人类历史上第一次大规模的人工细菌的毒害。今天美帝国主义在朝鲜前后方，在我们祖国的东北撒布细菌，并不是偶然的，而是有它的历史渊源的。但敌人的这种罪行只能说明它的软弱，并不能表示它的强大。不管日本也好，美国也好，当他们使用毒气和细菌来作战时，它们已经到了垂死的挣扎阶段了。因为用飞机打飞机，用大炮轰大炮，用刺刀拚刺刀，美国侵略者早已不是英勇的中朝人民部队的对手了。
    但细菌战又有什么用呢？细菌战并不像传说的那样可怕，敌人想用细菌昆虫来捣乱和破坏我们的后方，那简直是梦想。细菌毕竟是细菌，它是我们卫生人员所要扑灭的对象。很多护士、医生天天在消灭细菌；很多专家、教授天天在研究彻底消灭细菌昆虫的办法。它不过给我们添了一层麻烦，就是要更紧张地和细菌作斗争。我们要警告美国强盗，今天的中国人民不是生长在古罗马黑暗时代，而是生长在光芒万丈的毛泽东时代。我们祖国的人民能够战胜日本强盗，能够修建成渝铁路，能够兴办治淮工程，能够在东北内蒙防治鼠疫的流行，难道还没有足够的力量来消灭使用细菌的敌人和这些微小的生物吗？
    全国成千成万的医药卫生科学工作者踊跃报名参加志愿赴朝防疫检验队或在本岗位上积极参加各种有效的防疫工作的爱国热情和国际主义精神，这就是正义和善良的医药卫生科学工作人员的优良品质。我们要更积极地行动起来，目前首先要做好防疫的预备工作，充实每个人的各方面的防疫技术和专门知识，把愤怒化为力量，向广大人民即刻展开宣传，随时准备着响应祖国的呼唤，走上反对美国细菌战争的最前线！
