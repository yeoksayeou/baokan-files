Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Minister of Public Health of the Central People's Government, Li Dequan, and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Lisan, jointly issued the following written statement regarding the cessation of commemorating the so-called "May 12th" International Nurses' Day and the merging of Nurses' Day into the May Day International Labor Day celebration:

    Since the Chinese people have achieved a great revolutionary victory, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, our nation's nurses and all medical workers have joined trade union organizations and become part of the working class of the new China. Therefore, after joint discussions between the Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, it is believed that China's Nurses' Day should be merged into the May Day International Labor Day celebration starting this year, and the original "May 12th" International Nurses' Day should no longer be commemorated. Our nation's nurses and other medical workers should all, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, promote the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, learn from the heroic deeds generated by this revolutionary humanitarianism, such as the examples of model nurses and other medical workers who have emerged and are emerging during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the People's Liberation War, and especially the current War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, strive to improve their political consciousness and medical knowledge, arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, study advanced medical knowledge, develop medical and health undertakings, and carry out patriotic anti-epidemic health movements, and strive to defend the motherland, defend world peace, and enhance the health of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The Chinese Nursing Association issued a statement supporting the instructions of the Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to merge China's Nurses' Day into the May Day International Labor Day celebration. The text is as follows:

    The "May 12th" Nurses' Day is in commemoration of the British nursing worker Florence Nightingale. Nightingale made some contributions to nursing techniques, but she served the bourgeoisie's war of aggression and is meaningless to the working people. Since the national liberation, the political consciousness of our nursing workers has gradually increased, and they have already joined the trade union. Especially after the "Three-Anti" study, there has been significant progress in their thinking, and they have realized that their struggle goals are completely consistent with those of the working people. The joint announcement by the Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, determining that Nurses' Day will be merged with the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration, fully represents the will of our nursing workers. This is the glory of our nursing workers. Therefore, in addition to wholeheartedly supporting this decision by the Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we also call on nurses nationwide to unite with all health personnel and participate in the ranks of the working people with practical actions. Especially today, when U.S. imperialism is leading a dehumanizing bacteriological war, we must stand on the front lines of defending against bacteriological warfare with the selfless spirit of the working class, promote the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and fight to the end to smash all the conspiracies and crimes of U.S. imperialism.

    中央卫生部和全国总工会共同商定宣布
    今年起将我国护士节合并在“五一”节举行
    中华护士学会发表声明表示完全拥护
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长和中华全国总工会李立三副主席，为停止纪念所谓“五、一二”国际护士节、而把护士节合并在五一国际劳动节举行一事，联合发表书面谈话如下：
    自从我国人民取得了伟大的革命胜利，中华人民共和国成立以后，我们全国的护士和全体医务工作者一起参加了工会组织，成为新中国工人阶级的一部分。因此，中央人民政府卫生部和中华全国总工会共同商讨后，认为我国护士节应自今年起合并在五一国际劳动节举行，而停止纪念原来的“五·一二”国际护士节。我们全国的护士，及其他医务工作者都应根据毛主席的指示，发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，学习由这种革命人道主义所产生的英雄事例，如在抗日战争、人民解放战争尤其是现在的抗美援朝战争中所曾经涌现并正在涌现的模范的护士和其他医务工作者的榜样，努力提高自己的政治觉悟和医学知识，用马克思列宁主义武装自己，学习先进医学知识，发展医药卫生事业，开展爱国防疫卫生运动，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平和增进人民的健康而奋斗。
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华护士学会发表声明，拥护中央人民政府卫生部和中华全国总工会将我国护士节合并在五一国际劳动节举行的指示。文如下：
    “五·一二”护士节是纪念英国护理工作者南丁格尔的。南丁格尔在护理技术上曾有所贡献，但她是为资产阶级的侵略战争服务，对于劳动人民是没有意义的。全国解放以来，我们护理工作者的政治觉悟已逐渐提高，已经参加了工会，尤其经过“三反”学习以后，思想上更有显著进步，已认识到自己与劳动人民的奋斗目标是完全一致的。中央人民政府卫生部和全国总工会共同宣布，确定将护士节合并于“五一”国际劳动节举行，正充分代表了我们护理工作者的意志。这是我们护理工作者的光荣。因此我们除竭诚拥护中央人民政府卫生部和中华全国总工会这一决定外，同时号召全国护理工作者们与全体卫生人员团结一致，以实际行动参加到劳动人民的队伍中去。尤其在以美帝国主义为首，发动绝灭人性的细菌战的今日，我们一定要以工人阶级忘我的精神，站到防御细菌战的最前线，发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，为粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋和罪行斗争到底。
