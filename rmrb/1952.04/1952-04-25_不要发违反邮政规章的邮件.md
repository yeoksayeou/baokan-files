    Do Not Send Mail Violating Postal Regulations
    To the Editor: I am a staff member of the Undeliverable Mail Section of the Beijing Post Office. In my daily work, I often find that some senders put banknotes in ordinary letters, put letters in printed matter, and send letters with unclear sender and recipient information on the envelope, or simply without any information at all. These methods of postage not only violate postal regulations, but also cause incalculable losses to the post office in terms of business revenue and management. Just looking at the statistics from my section for December of last year and January and February of this year, there were 1,416 letters with unclear sender and recipient information, 96 blank envelopes, 39 pieces of printed matter containing letters, and 16 ordinary letters containing banknotes. In the spirit of serving the people, we have tried our best to overcome difficulties and found clues to the vast majority of the mail, separately indicating the new address, sealing, and adding seals, and returning them to the sender or recipient. Perhaps some people say that this loss is nothing, at most a few thousand yuan in remittance fees and tens of thousands of yuan in postage. I don't think so. The above-mentioned undeliverable or unreturnable mail is only a very small part of the mail collected and sent in one postal area in Beijing in three months; the loss figure is certainly not large. If we add up this kind of mail from all postal areas across the country throughout the year, the loss of national revenue will be great. This is a big loophole no matter what. In order to avoid the waste of manpower and material resources of the People's Post Office, I suggest that everyone pay attention to this issue, which is also a manifestation of loving the motherland and public property.

    不要发违反邮政规章的邮件
    编辑同志：我是北京邮局无着邮件股的工作人员。在日常工作中，我经常发现有些寄信人把钞票装在平信内寄走，把信件夹在印刷品内寄走，把信封的上下款不写清楚，或者干脆不写就发出等情况。这些付邮方法，不但抵触邮章，也使邮局在营业收入和经营管理上，受到难以估计的损失。只拿我股去年十二月和今年一月、二月的统计来看，信封上下款写得不清楚的信就有一千四百十六件，空白信封有九十六件，印刷品中夹信的有三十九件，平信中装钞票的有十六件。我们本着为人民服务的精神，想尽了方法，克服了困难，找到了绝大多数邮件的线索，分别批明新址、签封、加封，退给寄主或收件人。也许有人说这个损失算不了什么，充其量不过几千元汇费、几万元邮资而已。我认为不然。上述这些无法投递或无法退回的无着邮件，还只是北京一个邮区三个月内收寄邮件中极小的一部分，损失数字当然不大；如果把全国各邮区全年的这种邮件加起来，国家收入的损失就大了，这无论如何是一个大漏洞。为了避免人民邮政的人力物力的浪费，我建议大家都注意这个问题，这也是爱祖国、爱公共财产的一种表现。    关西村
