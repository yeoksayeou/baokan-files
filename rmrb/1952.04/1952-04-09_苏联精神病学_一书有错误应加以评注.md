    “Soviet Psychiatry” Contains Errors That Should Be Annotated

    Editor: I have read the book "Soviet Psychiatry" published by the East China Medical Life Publishing House (written by American JOSEPH WORTIS, M.D., translated jointly by the Department of Neuropsychiatry of Shanghai Medical College and the East China Psychiatric Prevention and Treatment Institute, published in January 1952). I found that in the first chapter, "Dialectical Materialism and Psychiatry," the author's understanding of Marxism-Leninism is incorrect.

    The author, when comparing the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards science, says: "In the eyes of Soviet scientists, the truth agreed upon by the majority is absolutely correct, and they feel that acknowledging the dissent of the minority is fundamentally useless." (Original book, page 1) This is a slander against the scientific attitude of Marxists-Leninists. In a socialist country with full freedom of thought, generally speaking, the conclusions agreed upon by the majority are in line with objective reality; however, the dissent of the minority, before being proven completely untenable through practical testing, will never be considered "fundamentally useless." When introducing historical materialism, the author says: "Marx said that human society is basically an economic system in which people seek mutual satisfaction of material needs" (Original book, page 6). Obviously, this is presenting the bourgeoisie's theory of class reconciliation as Marx's economic theory, which is wrong. In Section 6, the author quotes Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to illustrate that "Marxists do not ignore the importance of psychological factors when dealing with human problems," but then quotes Zhdanov saying, "The backwardness of Soviet philosophy lies in the subjective factors" (meaning neglecting subjective factors). If Zhdanov is referring to the current Soviet philosophy, then his criticism is completely unfounded. In the last paragraph of this section, the author says: "Soviet psychotherapy, like psychotherapy in other countries, is solely aimed at transforming people's thoughts." This is an indiscriminate statement that does not differentiate between the medical undertakings of socialist and capitalist countries, and is obviously wrong.

    The chief translator of the book introduces the author vaguely in the "Preface" saying that he "uses the scientific viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism to criticize the incorrect idealist viewpoints of bourgeois scholars on psychiatry." This is not responsible to the readers. I hope that the translators will annotate the erroneous views in the reprinting of the book. Lin Naishen

### “苏联精神病学”一书有错误应加以评注

    “苏联精神病学”一书有错误应加以评注
    编辑同志：我读了华东医务生活社出版的“苏联精神病学”一书（美国JOSEPH WORTIS,M.D. 著，上海医学院神经精神科、华东精神病防治院合译，一九五二年一月出版），发现在第一章“辩证唯物论与精神病学”里，作者对马列主义的理解，是不正确的。
    作者在比较美国和苏联对科学的态度时说：“在苏联的科学家看来：对于多数人一致同意的真理是绝对没有错误的，他们觉得承认少数人的异议是根本没有裨益的。”（原书第一页）这是对马列主义者的科学态度的诬蔑。在一个社会主义的有着充分的思想自由的国家里，一般来说，大多数同意的结论，都是符合于客观真实的；但少数人的异议，在没有经过实践的考验证明其完全不可成立前，也决不会被认为是“根本没有裨益的”。在介绍历史唯物论时，作者说：“马克思说人类社会在基本上是一种人民求得相互满足物质需要的经济制度”（原书第六页）。显然，这是把资产阶级的阶级调和论说成马克思的经济学说，这是错误的。在第六节里，作者引证恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的话，说明“马克思主义者对于处理人类问题时并不忽视心理因素的重要性”后，接着却引柴达诺夫的话说：“苏联哲学的落伍便在主观因素方面”（意即忽视主观因素）。如果柴达诺夫所指的是目前的苏联哲学，则他的批评是完全落空了。在这一节的最末一段，作者说：“苏联的心理治疗与其他各国的心理治疗一样，专以改造人们的思想为鹄的。”这是一种对社会主义和资本主义国家的医疗事业不加区别的说法，显然是错误的。
    该书主译者在该书的“前言”中笼统地介绍作者说：他是“以辩证唯物论的科学观点和方法来批判资产阶级学者对精神病学的不正确的唯心论点”。这是对读者不够负责的。希望译者在该书再版时对其中的错误见解加以评注。  林乃燊
