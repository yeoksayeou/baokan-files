State-run Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill
Workers and Technicians Collaborate to Increase Production
After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the relationship between workers and technicians at the state-run Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill became closer than before, and everyone worked together to improve production. The Wang Fusui steel wire maintenance team used to only level one machine per day for four people due to unreasonable labor organization and poor work planning. After repeated studies by employees and technicians, they changed to two people working simultaneously on both sides of the machine, doubling the machine leveling efficiency. The roving frame maintenance team, applying the spirit of Wu Nalian team's assembly line operation method, shortened the time to level one machine from two days to one day. In the third spinning workshop, after changing the warp yarn spinning to weft yarn tubes, the yarn content of the tubes increased, and the doffing frequency was reduced from five times per shift to 4.3 times per shift. At the same time, due to the increased yarn content of the tubes, the winding department could change fewer yarn ends, increasing output by 2.6%. The roving frame workshop's doffing workers changed their labor organization, reducing the original seven groups to six groups. The number of people in each group increased, and the doffing time was reduced from 55 seconds to 35 seconds, increasing output. In addition, after adjusting the grid spacing of the porcupine-type cotton opener in the opening and cleaning room, the effective fibers lost in the cotton waste were reduced by about 30%.

    国营天津第二棉纺织厂
    工人和技术人员协力增产
    经过了“三反”运动，国营天津第二棉纺织厂的工人和技术人员关系较前密切了，大家共同努力改进生产。王福绥钢丝保全小组，过去因劳动力组织不合理，工作计划性差，四个人每天只平一台车；经过职工和技术人员反复研究，改由两人在车两旁同时进行平车工作，平车效率提高了一倍。细纱保全小组，运用了吴乃连小组流水作业法的精神，由两天平一台车缩短为一天平一台。第三纺场细纱车间，纺经纱改用纬纱管后，纱管含纱量加大，落纱次数由每班五落减为每班四点三落。同时因纱管含纱量加大，打轴科可以少换纱穗，产量提高百分之二点六。细纱车间落纱工改变了劳动组织，把原来的七个组改成六个组。每组人数增多了，落纱时间由五十五秒减至三十五秒，提高了产量。此外，清花间豪猪式开棉机的尘格隔矩经过调整后，落棉中的有效纤维减少了百分之三十左右。（缪祥焘）
