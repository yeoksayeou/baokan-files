    An Interview with Yang Bailian, Head of the Vietnamese Trade Union Delegation
    We interviewed Yang Bailian, the head of the Vietnamese Trade Union Delegation, who was invited to China to attend the May Day celebrations. He said, "We are able to come to China at the invitation of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao to participate in this International Labor Day, a festival for the world's working class to unite, fight, and review their strength, because the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh have achieved victory in the war of resistance." His kind and pleasant conversation made us deeply feel the resonance of comrades-in-arms defending peace.
    Comrade Yang Bailian mentioned that during his journey, he saw the great construction undertakings of New China, the selfless work of the Chinese working class and the people, their spirit of cherishing national property, and the happy lives of the Chinese people. He said with emotion: All this fully proves that as long as the people themselves control the power, happy days will come. There is no doubt that the victory of the Chinese revolution has made a great contribution to defending world peace.
    The people of China and Vietnam have a long-standing friendship in history. In the struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and world peace, the people of China and Vietnam have shown even more brotherly unity and love. Comrade Yang Bailian said that after they entered our country's border, all the way to Beijing, many people gathered around them as soon as they saw them, warmly inquiring about the situation of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance and asking about President Ho Chi Minh's health. When they reported the news of the Vietnamese people's victory, everyone was very happy and excited.
    Comrade Yang Bailian spoke of the Vietnamese people's respect and love for the Chinese people. He said: The Vietnamese people care about Chinese affairs as if they were their own. They are concerned about China's resistance to America and aid to Korea and the land reform movement, as well as the situation of the great Huai River harnessing project. Last year, the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, headed by Huang Guoyue, made many reports to Vietnamese workers and the people after returning home. Each time a report was made, the audience shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" several times. Each report ended with lasting applause. Comrade Yang Bailian said excitedly: "From the deep friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, it can be seen that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the victory of the Vietnamese people; the victory of the Vietnamese people is also the victory of the Chinese people. The people of our two countries firmly believe that we can defeat the imperialist aggression."
    The Vietnamese people love peace. Comrade Yang Bailian said that the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have established a united front on the principle of equality and mutual respect for the sovereignty of all countries, and are carrying out a resolute struggle against the French imperialists, becoming an important part of defending world peace.
    He said that in the struggle against the French imperialist aggression, the Vietnamese people actively responded to the call of the World Peace Council, and more than seven million people have signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. This signature campaign is still ongoing. Workers in factories have also launched production competitions to defend peace. Labor model worker Gao Yuebao said: "Every hammer blow we strike is a serious blow to the imperialists."
    In the enemy-occupied areas, the people actively participated in the signature campaign regardless of how the imperialists oppressed and monitored them. They put the signed paper in a very small envelope and secretly sent it to the National Peace Committee. Because there was no literacy campaign in the enemy-occupied areas, many people could not write. But this did not hinder their determination and actions to defend world peace, and they all put their fingerprints on the signature paper.
    Finally, Comrade Yang Bailian talked about the bacteriological warfare launched by U.S. imperialism. He said angrily: "After the failure of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Korea, it shamelessly carried out bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. When the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese working class heard this news, they were very angry. They have united more closely and actively participated in the competition movement to crush the imperialists' aggressive schemes with practical actions, and to strive for the independence and democracy of Vietnam and for lasting peace in the world!"

    访越南工会代表团团长杨白莲
    我们访问了应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的越南工会代表团杨白莲团长。他说：“我们能够应邀来中国参加这个全世界工人阶级团结、战斗、检阅力量的五一国际劳动节，是因为毛主席领导下的中国人民取得了胜利，是因为胡志明主席领导下的越南人民抗战取得了胜利。”他的亲切、愉快的谈话，使我们深刻地感觉到保卫和平的战友心弦的共鸣。
    杨白莲团长谈到他在旅途中看到了新中国的伟大建设事业，中国工人阶级和全国人民忘我工作的情况和爱护国家财产的精神，以及中国人民幸福的生活。他感动地说：这一切充分证明了只要人民自己掌握了政权，幸福的日子就会到来。毫无疑问，中国革命的胜利，对保卫世界和平有很大贡献。
    中越两国人民在历史上有着悠久的友谊关系。在为争取民族独立、人民民主和世界和平的斗争中，中越两国人民更表现了兄弟一样的团结友爱。杨白莲团长说，他们进入我国边境后，直到来北京途中，很多人一看见他们，就围拢过来，亲热地询问越南人民抗战的情况，问候胡志明主席的健康。当他们报告了越南人民的胜利消息后，大家都非常喜欢和兴奋。
    杨白莲团长谈到越南人民对中国人民的敬爱。他说：越南人民对中国的事情就像对自己的事情一样地关心。他们关心中国的抗美援朝和土地改革运动，也关心伟大的治淮工程的情况。去年，以黄国越为首的越南人民访华代表团回国后，曾经向越南工人和全国人民作过很多次报告。每次报告时，听众都几次地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”每次报告都是在经久不息的掌声中结束。杨白莲团长兴奋地说：“从中越人民深厚的友谊上可以看到，中国人民革命的胜利，就是越南人民的胜利；越南人民的胜利，也就是中国人民的胜利。我们两国人民坚信能够击退帝国主义的侵略。”
    越南人民是爱好和平的。杨白莲团长说，越南人民、寮国和高棉的人民在平等、互相尊重各国主权的原则下，建立了统一战线，向法帝国主义者进行坚决的斗争，成为保卫世界和平的一个重要部分。
    他说，越南人民在反对法帝国主义侵略的斗争中，积极地响应了世界和平理事会的号召，已有七百多万人在要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言上签了名。这个签名运动现在还在继续进行中。工厂里的工人们，同时展开了生产竞赛，来保卫和平。工人劳动模范高曰宝说：“我们每一下铁锤，都是对帝国主义者的一个严重的打击。”
    在敌占区，人民不管帝国主义者如何压迫和监视，也积极地参加了签名运动。他们把签了名的纸，装在一个很小的信封中，偷偷地送给全国和平委员会。敌占区因为没有进行扫除文盲运动，很多人不会写字。但这并不能阻碍他们保卫世界和平的决心和行动，他们也都在签名纸上按上了自己的手印。
    最后，杨白莲团长谈到了美帝国主义发动的细菌战，他愤怒地说：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜失败后，居然无耻地在朝鲜和中国东北地区进行了细菌战。我们越南人民和越南工人阶级听说这个消息，都非常的愤怒。他们更紧密地团结起来，更积极地参加了竞赛运动，用实际行动来粉碎帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，为争取越南独立和民主，为全世界的持久和平而奋斗！”    （李冀）（附图片）
