Xinhua News Agency, April 28th – The American occupiers and their running dog, the Yoshida reactionary government, have openly refused to issue passports to Japanese trade union representatives, prohibiting them from coming to China to attend the May Day celebrations.

Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited Japanese trade union representatives to come to our country to participate in the May Day celebrations, the Japanese Wage Joint Struggle Liaison Council, the All-Japan Industrial Trade Union Conference, and many other industrial and local trade unions, including those affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, have decided to send representatives to China. The Japanese working masses enthusiastically launched a movement to elect representatives. Japanese workers fervently hoped to send more representatives to China, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' original quota of 24 Japanese trade union representatives could not meet the needs of the Japanese trade unions. Therefore, the Japanese trade unions requested the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to increase the quota of Japanese trade union representatives, and this was agreed to by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

However, the Japanese Yoshida government, according to the wishes of its American masters, has been disrupting and obstructing the selection and dispatch of representatives to China by Japanese trade unions from the beginning. As early as April 16, the Yoshida reactionary government publicly announced that it would not issue passports to Japanese trade union representatives. On the 26th, the Yoshida government rejected all eighty-one applications from Japanese trade union representatives who intended to come to our country to participate in the May Day celebrations for the issuance of passports.

This unreasonable measure by the American and Japanese reactionaries has aroused great anger among the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th – The Indonesian trade union delegation, invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend the May Day celebration ceremonies in our country, has been unable to depart for Beijing because the British government has delayed issuing transit visas.

Since receiving the invitation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Indonesian trade union circles have actively selected representatives and organized a delegation. The Indonesian General Trade Union selected thirteen representatives headed by Suyadi. The full list of representatives is as follows: Suyadi, Gagin, Sumantri, Ibdu, Junaidi, Khalifa (female), Anwar, Waroga, Yunni, Alni, Suroso, Suradi, Subiyanto. The Indonesian Islamic Trade Union selected three representatives: Gazali, Sunardo, and Harun. However, when the representatives applied to the British government for transit visas in Jakarta, the British government has been slow to issue them. Therefore, the sixteen representatives of the Indonesian trade unions, who are ready, have not been able to leave for China in time to participate in the May Day celebrations.

People here believe that the British government's delay in issuing transit visas to the Indonesian trade union representatives is unreasonable. This is a deliberate obstruction of the free exchange between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. The British government should immediately change this unreasonable attitude and quickly issue the transit visas to the Indonesian trade union representatives so that they can come to China to participate in the May Day celebrations as they wish.

    日本工人热烈选举代表来我国参加“五一”节
    美日反动派竟公然拒发出国护照
    英国政府无理拖延发给印尼工会代表过境签证
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国占领者及其走狗吉田反动政府竟公然拒绝签发日本工会代表的出国护照，禁止他们到中国来参加五一节观礼。
    自中华全国总工会邀请日本工会代表来我国参加五一节后，日本工资共同斗争联络会、全日本产业别工会会议以及其他许多产业工会和地方工会，包括日本工会总评议会所属的工会，纷纷决定派遣代表前来中国。日本工人群众热烈地展开了选举代表运动。日本工人们热烈地希望能够多派代表到中国来，中华全国总工会原定邀请日本工会代表二十四人的名额已无法满足日本工会的需要。因此，日本工会方面曾要求中华全国总工会增加日本工会代表的名额，并获得了中华全国总工会的同意。
    但是，日本吉田政府根据其美国主子的意旨，自始就在破坏和阻挠日本工会选派代表前往中国。吉田反动政府早在四月十六日即公开宣布，它将不发护照给日本工会代表。二十六日，吉田政府对于准备到我国来参加五一节的八十一名日本工会代表要求签发出国护照的申请，一律都不批准。
    美、日反动派这种无理的措施，激起了日本人民的极大愤怒。
    【新华社二十八日讯】应中华全国总工会的邀请，准备前来我国参加五一节庆祝典礼的印尼工会代表团，由于英国政府拖延不发过境签证，迄今尚无法启程前来北京。
    印尼工会界自从接到中华全国总工会的邀请之后，就积极选派代表，组织代表团。印尼总工会选出了以苏雅第为首的十三名代表，全体代表名单如下：苏雅第、加沁、苏曼特利、伊布都、朱乃第、卡里发（女）、安哇尔、哇罗加、云尼、阿尔尼、苏罗梭、苏拉第、苏比延多。印尼回教工会选出了三位代表：加渣利、苏拿尔多、哈伦。但是，当代表们在雅加达向英国政府申请过境签证时，英国政府迟迟不签发过境签证。因此，业已准备就绪的十六位印尼工会的代表们，迄今不能及时动身前来中国参加五一节庆祝典礼。
    此间人士认为，英国政府拖延不给印尼工会代表们签发过境签证是毫无理由的。这是对中国人民和印尼人民自由交往的蓄意阻挠。英国政府应立即改变这种无理态度，迅速签发印尼工会代表们的过境签证，使他们能够如愿地赶来中国参加五一节庆祝典礼。
