    The Propaganda Department of the CPC Beijing Fifteenth District Committee
    Conducted a Spot Check on the Newspaper Reading Situation of Cadres Working in Rural Areas
    Editor: Recently, we conducted a spot check on the newspaper reading situation of four comrades who frequently work in rural areas. The comrade with the lowest level of education among them can read popular newspapers, but their newspaper reading situation during their time in the countryside is very poor. Comrade Xie Guixiang, the propaganda cadre of the District Youth League Committee, has been working in rural areas for nearly three months, with the task of participating in the "Three Antis" campaign. During such a long period, he only occasionally glanced at newspaper headlines. Therefore, he is not only unaware of many major events in the country and the world, but also cannot even name a single example of a奸商 (a cunning merchant) poisoning volunteer soldiers. Zhang Ping, the director of the District Democratic Women's Federation, and cadre Feng Cong, are both unaware of the basic contents of the All-China Women's Federation's notice regarding the commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day. One comrade who specializes in leading production in rural areas is completely unaware of the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952" and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government's "Opinions on Launching a Patriotic Production Increase Competition in 1952." Because they do not pay attention to reading newspapers and are unaware of important decisions and documents related to their work, they naturally cannot fully transform the calls of the Party and the People's Government into mass actions.
    This serious situation, although caused by these comrades' own neglect of political study, is mainly due to the long-term abandonment of inspection and leadership by our leading organs. Therefore, in addition to asking these comrades to conduct self-criticism, we have also stipulated the following improvement measures: 1. Regularly give current affairs reports to all cadres, especially cadres working in rural areas, based on materials from newspapers; 2. Establish a system for cadres working in rural areas to return to the office periodically and collectively, in order to organize them to study and hold current affairs seminars; 3. Subscribe to a "Current Affairs Handbook" for each cadre working in rural areas.
    The above-mentioned improvement measures are not perfect, and we will continue to work hard to improve them in the future. We hope that other organizations can introduce some advanced experiences in strengthening cadres' current affairs studies.

### 中共北京市十五区委员会宣传部  抽查了下乡干部的读报情况

    中共北京市十五区委员会宣传部
    抽查了下乡干部的读报情况
    编辑同志：最近我们抽查了四位经常下乡工作的同志读报的情况。他们当中文化程度最低的人也能阅读通俗报纸，但他们在下乡期间阅读报纸的情况却很坏。青年团区工委的宣传干事谢桂祥同志，连续下乡近三个月，任务是参加“三反”工作。在这样长的时间中，他只是偶尔看看报纸标题。因此，他不但对国家和世界上许多大事不清楚，甚至说不出一个奸商毒害志愿军的例子来。区民主妇联的主任张萍和干事冯聪，都不知道全国妇联关于纪念“三八”国际妇女节的通知的基本内容。一位专门下乡领导生产的同志，竟不知道中央人民政府政务院“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”和中央人民政府农业部“关于开展一九五二年爱国增产竞赛的意见”。他们不注意阅读报纸，不知道有关业务的重要决定和文件，当然也就不能把党和人民政府的号召完全变成群众性的行动。
    这种严重情况，虽然是由于这些同志自己忽视政治学习所引起的，但我们领导机关长期地放弃了检查和领导，却是主要的原因。因此，我们除了让这些同志自行检讨外，还规定了如下的改进办法：一、经常根据报纸上的材料向全体干部，特别是下乡干部作时事报告；二、建立下乡干部定期、集体回机关的制度，以借此时机组织他们学习，并举行时事座谈；三、为每个下乡干部订一份“时事手册”。
    上述改进办法并不完善，今后我们还要继续努力改进。我们希望其他机关能够介绍些加强干部时事学习的先进经验。
