    The Experience of the Tsinghua University Aviation Academy Proves That the Department Adjustment Plan is Completely Correct

    Editor: When we saw the "National Institute of Technology Adjustment Plan," we were very excited. Our Tsinghua University Aviation Academy was established last summer by merging the aviation departments of Tsinghua University, Peiyang University, Xiamen University, and Northwest Institute of Technology. In the nearly one year since the merger of these four departments, we have deeply felt that this adjustment has many benefits for the country, the people, and us students. Before the adjustment, some schools offered courses but had no one to teach them, while some schools had too many teachers for the same course. Now, this phenomenon no longer exists; and because of the centralized use of books and instruments, teaching efficiency will be greatly improved. These are all benefits that we have personally experienced.

    After the adjustment of the national institutes of technology, a large number of talents for national construction can be cultivated, enabling the country to embark on the road to industrialization. In order to realize the industrialization of our motherland as soon as possible, we must complete the learning tasks assigned to us by the motherland.

    All students of the First Group, Second Grade, Tsinghua University Aviation Academy

    清华大学航空学院的经验证明
    院系调整方案是完全正确的
    编辑同志：当我们看到“全国工学院调整方案”的时候，我们感到非常兴奋。我们清华大学航空学院是去年暑期由清华大学、北洋大学、厦门大学和西北工学院四校的航空系合并成立的。在这四系合并后将近一年的时光里，我们深切地感觉到，这种调整对国家人民和我们学生都是有很多好处的。在没有调整以前，有的学校设了课程而无人教授，某些学校担任同样的课程的教师又太多。现在，这种现象不再存在了；而且由于图书仪器的集中使用，也会大大地提高教学效率。这些都是我们切身体验到的好处。
    全国工学院调整以后，能够大量地培养国家建设人才，使国家走上工业化的道路。为了祖国的工业化早日实现，我们一定要完成祖国交给我们的学习任务。
    清华大学航空学院二年级第一大组全体同学
