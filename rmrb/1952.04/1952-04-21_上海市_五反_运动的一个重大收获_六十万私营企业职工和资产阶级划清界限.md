    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A major achievement of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign is that the 600,000 employees of private enterprises in Shanghai have received profound class education and practical struggle training in the great "Five-Anti" struggle, and have ideologically drawn a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie.
    Since the liberation of Shanghai, the consciousness of Shanghai's private enterprise employees has continuously improved through movements such as Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries. However, because they have been deceived and exploited by the bourgeoisie for a long time, and especially because the bourgeoisie has used various despicable means to obstruct workers from participating in social and trade union activities for the past three years, and has used petty favors to divide the workers, some employees still have various muddled ideas. Before the "Five-Anti" campaign, muddled ideas such as "production is for the boss," "the boss is the source of good fortune, the workers are doomed to suffer," and "the boss earns money to support the workers" existed among veteran workers and female workers. They usually only cared about their own work and wages, and did not ask about politics. However, in the "Five-Anti" campaign, these many workers were also universally mobilized. 400,000 employees in the city participated in the bitterness-telling movement, thereby recognizing the truth of "who supports whom." In particular, when they saw the various illegal crimes of the capitalists who were exposed, they were all extremely angry. Yuan Baiqi, a veteran worker at the 93 Shuttle Factory, said: "Before the 'Five-Anti' campaign, I always thought that capitalists could make money and were superior to us workers. This time, the workers exposed his 'five poisons', which awakened me. I have worked for more than ten years, bending over and crooked, and I am still empty-handed. The boss sways around all day, developing from one factory to several factories, and still racking his brains to cut corners and steal national property. Why shouldn't I draw a line between myself and him?"
    Before the "Five-Anti" campaign, there was a serious gap between senior staff and workers in private enterprises. Illegal capitalists often used methods such as secretly giving more "bonuses," more "dividends," subsidizing salaries, subsidizing medical expenses, or lending houses to win over senior staff and use them for illegal activities. Therefore, the class consciousness of many senior staff was blurred. At the same time, workers generally believed that senior staff had high salaries and good lives and were "boss's lackeys." For example, Shen Jichao, a staff member of Zhonghua Iron Factory, was used by the boss to bribe cadres in the past, asking him to accompany others to dance and drink, and he thought the boss looked up to him. His thinking changed in the "Five-Anti" struggle. He said painfully: "In the past, the boss won me over to harm cadres, and I thought this kind of life was very pleasant. I was completely greedy for enjoyment and forgot about my worker brothers. From now on, I must stand firm." The workers also realized that the past disunity within the workers was caused by the illegal bourgeoisie. When many senior staff were welcomed and encouraged by the majority of employees after "returning to the ranks," they were moved to tears. They realized that taking the "boss's path" was shameful. Some said: "Returning to the ranks of the working class is like returning to the embrace of my mother again!" After ideologically drawing a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie, they bravely broke with the bourgeoisie and exposed the illegal crimes of the capitalists. The materials exposed by more than 3,000 senior staff alone amounted to more than 10,000 cases.
    Among the employees, there was also a muddled idea of "relying on connections" in the past. These people were all the boss's "relatives and friends." In the "Five-Anti" struggle, they also drew a clear class line and broke the muddled concept of "relying on connections." For example, Fan Zongwen, the nephew of the big boss of Huaxin Stationery and Instrument Factory, and Ni Menghou, the boss's brother-in-law, usually had a very good relationship with the boss. This time, they broke their friendship and exposed more than 30 illegal acts of the boss. They said: "What relatives are relatives? Only the trade union is our backer."
    The workers have drawn a line between themselves and the bourgeoisie, recognized the great and bright future of the working class, and have therefore achieved unprecedented great unity, becoming a stronger team with greater awareness, organization, and combat effectiveness. This is a major achievement of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign and a major development of the Shanghai workers' movement. In the "Five-Anti" struggle, the workers, with the attitude of masters of the country, classified the capitalists and seriously reviewed and approved the capitalists' confessions, and expressed that they would supervise the capitalists to do a good job in production in the future. Now, new atmospheres have begun to appear in the factories and stores that have been inspected. For example, the production volume of Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory has increased by 0.43% compared to before the inspection, and female worker Shen Xiaomei has increased her daily weaving of fine cloth from 48 yards to 52 yards. The factory's trade union is now consulting with the capitalists to formulate a production plan. The workers of Hailong Woolen Mill no longer allow the boss to hand over bad goods to the state. The workers do not let go of even a single "broken warp" or a little "loss of hair" to ensure that good goods are handed over to the state. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the output of 20-count yarn at Qixin Yarn Factory has reached the highest record since liberation.

### 上海市“五反”运动的一个重大收获  六十万私营企业职工和资产阶级划清界限

    上海市“五反”运动的一个重大收获
    六十万私营企业职工和资产阶级划清界限
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市私营企业的六十万职工在伟大的“五反”斗争中，受到了深刻的阶级教育和实际斗争的锻炼，已从思想上和资产阶级划清了界限。
    上海市私营企业的职工，在上海解放后，经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动，觉悟程度不断提高，但由于他们长期地受着资产阶级的欺骗和剥削，特别是三年来资产阶级用各种卑鄙的手段阻碍工人参加社会活动和工会活动，并以小恩小惠来分化工人，有一部分职工仍然存在着各种糊涂思想。“五反”运动前，在老工人和女工中间存在着“生产是为了老板”，“老板是福根，工人是苦命”，“老板赚铜钿养活工人”之类的糊涂思想。他们平时只管自己做工拿工钱，不问政治。但是在“五反”运动中，这许多工人也普遍地发动起来了。全市有四十万职工投入了诉苦运动，从而认识了“谁养活谁”的真理。特别是当他们看到了被检举出来的资本家的各种非法罪行时，无不愤怒万分。九三梭子厂老工人袁百起说：“我在‘五反’运动前总以为资本家会赚钱，比我们做工的高一等。这次工人揭露了他的‘五毒’，使我醒了过来。我做了十几年工，做得弯腰曲背，仍是两手空空，老板成天摇摇摆摆，从一爿厂发展到几爿厂，还挖空心思偷工减料，盗窃国家财产，我为什么再不和他划清界限呢？”
    在“五反”运动前，私营企业中的高级职员和工人之间存在着严重的隔阂。违法资本家常常用暗中多给“奖金”、多“分红”、补贴薪水、补贴医药费或借给房子住等等方法来拉拢高级职员，并利用他们进行非法活动，因而不少高级职员阶级意识模糊。同时，工人们也普遍地认为高级职员待遇高生活好，是“老板的走狗”。如中华铁工厂职员沈季超，过去老板利用他去行贿干部，叫他陪别人跳舞、吃酒，他还以为这是老板看得起他。在“五反”斗争中他的思想转变了，他痛切地说：“过去老板拉拢我去陷害干部，我还以为这种生活很写意，完全是贪图享受忘了工人兄弟，今后一定要站稳立场。”工人们也认识了过去工人内部不团结是违法资产阶级造成的。许多高级职员在“归队”后受到广大职工的欢迎鼓励时，感动得掉下眼泪，他们认识了走“老板的道路”是可耻的，有的说：“回到工人阶级队伍里，好像重新回到母亲怀抱里一样的温暖！”他们在思想上划清了阶级界限后，就勇敢地和资产阶级撕破脸皮，检举违法资本家的罪行，其中三千多个高级职员所检举的材料就达一万余件。
    在职工中，过去还有一种“靠牌头吃饭”的糊涂思想。这些人都是老板的“亲友”。在“五反”斗争中，他们也划清了阶级界限，打破了“靠牌头吃饭”的糊涂观念。如华新文具仪器厂大老板的外甥婿范宗文，舅子倪孟侯平时和老板感情很好，这次撕破了情面，检举了老板三十多件违法行为。他们说：“什么亲戚不亲戚，只有工会才是我们的靠山。”
    工人们和资产阶级划清了界限，认清了工人阶级远大的光明前途，因而达到了空前大团结，成为一支更有觉悟、更有组织、更有战斗力的坚强的队伍，这是上海“五反”运动的一个重大的收获，也是上海工人运动的一个重大的发展。工人们在“五反”斗争中，以国家主人翁的姿态给资本家排队分类，认真地审查通过资本家的坦白书，并表示今后要督促资本家搞好生产。现在，已经过检查的厂店都开始出现了新的气象。如永大染织厂生产量已比检查前增加了百分之零点四三，女工沈小妹每天织细布从四十八码增至五十二码。该厂工会现正和资方协商订立生产计划。海龙毛纺厂工人再不让老板拿坏货交给国家，工人们连一丝“断经”、一点“失毛”都不放过，保证把好货交给国家。启新纱厂在“五反”运动后，二十支纱的产量已达到解放后的最高纪录。
