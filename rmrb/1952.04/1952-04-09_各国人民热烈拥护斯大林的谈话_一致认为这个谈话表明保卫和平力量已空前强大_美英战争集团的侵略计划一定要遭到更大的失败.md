Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Public opinion circles and social figures in countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Korea, and Britain warmly support Stalin's answers to questions raised by a group of American newspaper and magazine editors. The German Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement saying: "Stalin's speech has strengthened our confidence and made us more convinced that the unification of the motherland and the safeguarding of peace in Germany and the world are achievable. Stalin's speech shows that the forces of peace have grown stronger, and the people of all countries will certainly be able to prevent the outbreak of a new world war." All members of the Saxony-Anhalt State Assembly also issued a statement, unanimously supporting Stalin's view that now is the appropriate time to unify Germany.

The Hungarian Working People's Party newspaper "Szabad Nép" published an editorial on the 3rd, saying: "Stalin's reply is extremely important for the current international situation. Just as the US imperialists continue to prepare adventures and attempt to undermine the people's desire for peace, Stalin's speech alleviates the worries caused to people by the alarmists." The Romanian Workers' Party newspaper "Scânteia" pointed out: Stalin's reply "is a lightning bolt piercing through the dense fog of war hysteria." Currently, American cannibals are spreading germ-carrying insects in Korea and Northeast China, and children in Tunisia are being slaughtered... Under such circumstances, Stalin's reply is of even greater significance.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 4th, saying: Marshal Stalin's reply provides the people of the world with a program for eliminating the danger of a new war and consolidating world peace, and once again shows that the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace fully conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world who oppose war. Marshal Stalin's reply to the first question does not mean that the US-British imperialist warmongers have abandoned their ambitions of aggression, but rather that the strength of the peace camp has grown unprecedentedly strong. The aggressive plans of the war bloc will inevitably suffer even greater failure in the face of the increasingly powerful forces of the peace camp.

The British Daily Worker published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "Begin Negotiations Immediately," urging the British people to resolutely demand that the British government participate in a summit conference of the major powers.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: According to TASS, Delhi, 4th Dispatch: The General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, Ajoy Ghosh, issued a statement supporting Stalin's reply to the questions raised by a group of American newspaper editors.

Ghosh pointed out: Comrade Stalin, the leader of peace-loving humanity, gave a short reply to the question of "Is a third world war closer now than it was two or three years ago?" This should not be understood as saying that the situation has remained the same as before for the past three years, without any changes. On the contrary, this reply emphasizes that the balance of power between the war camp and the peace camp has undergone a major change. This reply summarizes the great achievements of the most powerful movement in history - the movement to defend peace. Due to the great efforts of the democratic peace camp (which has supporters in all countries of the world), due to the growing strength of the people of the Soviet Union and China and other democratic countries, and due to the bankruptcy of the imperialist war plans in Korea, Vietnam, and other countries, the efforts of the US-British imperialists, who attempt to launch a world war, have so far been unsuccessful. Humanity has stopped those savages who, out of their ambition to dominate the world, want to destroy everything sacred and everything that humanity cherishes. This achievement will surely increase the courage of all peace supporters and enable them to face the tasks ahead with confidence.

Ghosh went on to say: Comrade Stalin's replies to the other questions are equally important. The American, British, and French imperialists pretend to support peace, but at the same time stubbornly refuse to sign a peace pact with the Soviet Union and China. They even refuse to meet with the leaders of the Soviet and Chinese governments, because they understand that in such meetings, they would either have to agree to measures for establishing peace, or expose their true colors in front of the whole world. They pretend to support peace and national unification, but at the same time they are turning West Germany back into a war base and maintaining the division of Germany, because they understand that a unified, democratic Germany will become a fortress of peace rather than a fortress of war. They pretend to be advocates of peace, but at the same time they say that the communist system and the capitalist system cannot coexist peacefully, cannot cooperate with each other, and cannot establish mutually beneficial and normal political and economic relations. They understand that establishing such relations would be tantamount to abandoning the "cold war" policy, which brings super-profits to the monopoly capitalists, enables them to divert the people's attention from the pressing problems of the moment, and paves the way for the world war they are eager for.

Ghosh concluded by saying: Comrade Stalin's reply is a call to the people of the world to further strengthen the struggle for peace, for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and to expand and consolidate the movement for the freedom and unification of all nations.

    各国人民热烈拥护斯大林的谈话
    一致认为这个谈话表明保卫和平力量已空前强大
    美英战争集团的侵略计划一定要遭到更大的失败
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜和英国等国舆论界与社会人士，热烈拥护斯大林对一批美国报纸杂志编辑所提问题的答复。德国民主妇女联合会发表声明说：“斯大林的谈话加强了我们的信心，使我们更加确信：建立祖国的统一和维护德国及世界的和平，都是可以实现的。斯大林的谈话表明和平力量已经壮大，各国人民一定可以阻止新世界大战的爆发。”萨克森—安哈特州议会的全体议员们也发表声明，一致拥护斯大林关于现在是统一德国的适当时机这一见解。
    匈牙利劳动人民党机关报“自由人民”报在三日发表社论说：“斯大林的答复对于当前的国际形势是极为重要的。正当美帝国主义者继续准备冒险并企图破坏人民的和平愿望的时候，斯大林的谈话减轻了恐慌制造者对人们所造成的忧虑。”罗马尼亚工人党机关报“火花报”指出：斯大林的答复“是一道冲破战争歇斯底里浓雾的闪电”。目前美国吃人生番正在朝鲜和中国东北散布带菌毒虫，突尼斯的儿童在遭受屠杀……在这种情况之下，斯大林的答复更具有重大意义。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”在四日发表社论说：斯大林大元帅的这个答复，给全世界人民提出了消除新战争危险和巩固世界和平的纲领，并再次表明：苏联一贯的和平政策完全符合反对战争的全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。斯大林大元帅对第一个问题的答复，并不意味着美英帝国主义战争贩子们放弃了侵略的野心，而是意味着和平阵营的力量已空前强大。战争集团的侵略计划在日益强大的和平阵营力量面前，一定要遭到更大的失败。
    英国工人日报在三日发表题为“立即开始谈判”的社论，敦促英国人民坚决要求英国政府参加各大国首脑会议。
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社德里四日讯：印度共产党总书记高士顷发表声明，拥护斯大林对一批美国报纸编辑所提的问题的答复。
    高士指出：爱好和平人类的领袖斯大林同志对于“第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？”这一问题的简短答复，不应该认为是说近三年来形势仍然和以前一样，没有发生任何变化。恰恰相反，这个答复着重指出了战争阵营与和平阵营的力量对比，已发生了重大改变。这个答复总结了历史上最强大的运动——保卫和平运动所获得的巨大成就。由于民主和平阵营（它在世界各国中都有拥护者）的巨大努力，由于苏联和中国及其他民主国家的人民力量的日益壮大，由于帝国主义战争计划在朝鲜、越南及其他各国的破产，企图发动世界大战的美英帝国主义者的种种努力至今都不能得逞。人类制止了那些由于妄图称霸世界而要毁灭神圣的一切和人类所珍贵的一切的生番们。这个成就必将增加一切和平拥护者的勇气，使他们满怀信心地迎接他们面前的任务。
    高士接着说：斯大林同志对另外几个问题的答复也是同等重要的。美、英、法帝国主义者伪装拥护和平，同时却顽固地拒绝和苏联及中国签订和平公约。他们甚至拒绝和苏联及中国政府的领袖会谈，因为他们懂得：在这样的会谈中，他们不得不或者同意关于建立和平的措施，或者就在全世界的面前暴露原形。他们假装拥护和平与民族统一，同时却把西德重新变成战争基地并保持德国的分裂状态，因为他们懂得：统一、民主的德国必将成为一个和平堡垒而不是战争堡垒。他们假装为和平拥护者，同时却说什么共产主义制度和资本主义制度不能和平共存、不能互相合作、不能建立互利的正常的政治经济关系。他们懂得：建立这样的关系就等于放弃“冷战”政策，而这种“冷战”政策却是给垄断资本家带来超额利润，并使他们能够转移人民对目前迫切的问题的注意，能够为他们所热望的世界大战铺平道路的。
    高士最后说：斯大林同志的答复，是一个对全世界人民的号召，号召他们进一步加强争取和平、争取缔结五大国和平公约的斗争，扩大和巩固争取各民族自由和统一的运动。
