    Tianjin United Machinery Factory Workers
    Actively Improve Operating Techniques During the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    To the Editor: The employees of the Tianjin Public United Machinery Factory are actively engaged in production and improving operating techniques during the intense "Three-Anti" campaign. Old technician Yu Donglai (now promoted to deputy director of the workshop) took the time to research and improve washing operations. He wondered: why can't the work be done faster when using oil steel washing knives from the Northeast? If it's faster, either the knife deteriorates or the work is ruined. He decided to make his own washing knives to overcome this difficulty. He replaced the washing knife with a white steel knife, drilled two square holes in the middle of the knife bar, sharpened the white steel knife head, and installed it on the knife bar; then he strung three workpieces together, aligned the front dividing plate, the rear top center, and the middle gear, and used a high-speed cutting method for fast turning (326 revolutions per minute). As a result, production increased 5.2 times, saving more than 58 million yuan annually. Planing technicians Zhuang Zhentian and Yuan Zongtian experimented with multi-tool planing last year but failed. The "Three-Anti" campaign raised their class consciousness and strengthened their determination to persevere. They re-experimented with multi-tool planing and finally succeeded on March 10th. Work efficiency has more than doubled, saving the country more than 50 million yuan annually. Machinist Liu Heyi, now promoted to deputy section chief, recently succeeded in researching the multi-tool, multi-blade method, which has sparked a wave of learning multi-tool, multi-blade techniques among workers in various workshops, significantly improving production efficiency.

    天津联合机器厂工人
    在“三反”运动中积极改进操作技术
    编辑同志：天津市公营联合机器厂职工，在紧张的“三反”运动中，积极进行生产，并改进了操作技术。老技工于东来（现已被提升为车间副主任）抽出时间，研究改进洗车工作。他想：为什么用东北出的油钢洗刀干活，不能再赶的快些呢？快了，不是刀变了质，就是把活洗坏。他决定自己作洗刀，克服这个困难。他以白钢刀代替洗刀，在刀杆当中钻了两个四方眼，把白钢刀头磨好，安在刀杆上；然后把三个工作物穿成一串，再把前面分盘、后面顶尖和当中牙轮对正，用高速切削法开快车（每分钟三百二十六转）。结果，提高生产五点二倍，每年可节省五千八百多万元。刨车技工庄振田、袁宗橝，去年试验刨车多刀法，失败了。“三反”运动提高了他们的阶级觉悟，坚定了他们的钻研决心，他们重新试验刨车多刀法，终于在三月十日胜利成功。工作效率提高了一倍多，每年可以给国家节省五千多万元。机工刘和义，现已被提升为副科长，最近他研究多刀多刃工作法成功，在各车间工人中掀起了学习多刀多刃的热潮，生产效率显著提高。
