    Most areas of the country have experienced even rainfall this spring, and spring planting has started successively in various regions. In the spring wheat areas of Northwest, North, and Northeast China, sowing is proceeding intensely. Most of the tobacco fields in Henan have already been sown. In the Yangtze River basin, rice is being sown, while in the Pearl River basin, rice seedlings are being transplanted. Early rice on Hainan Island is heading and flowering. In the wheat-producing areas north of the Yangtze River, such as Shandong, northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, there has been more rainfall since the beginning of spring. In addition, farmers in various regions have carried out harrowing and hoeing to conserve soil moisture and applied additional fertilizer, resulting in generally good growth of winter wheat. In the coarse grain producing areas north of the Great Wall, rainfall this spring has generally exceeded the average rainfall in previous years. Except for some areas that are slightly dry, spring sowing should not encounter difficulties. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, excessive spring rain and cold weather in Jiangxi, Hubei, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu have damaged spring crops such as rapeseed, peas, and wheat. Since mid-to-late March, the weather has gradually cleared up, and local farmers are using methods such as ditching for drainage, weeding, and applying additional fertilizer to promote crop growth. In some areas of Guangxi and Fujian provinces, excessive spring rain caused rotten seedlings. Since mid-March, there have been more sunny days and less rain, and the situation has improved. Continuous spring rain has fallen in various parts of the Southwest region. The severely drought-stricken northern Sichuan region received its first spring rain in four months from the 9th to the 10th. Except for the northern mountainous areas where rainfall was relatively small, rainwater permeated the soil by five inches in other counties in the region, and paddy fields increased water storage by about one inch. Most areas of southern Sichuan also experienced continuous rainfall, with the water depth in general paddy fields increasing by one inch. Ya'an and Kangding prefectures in Xikang, as well as Dali prefecture in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, have successively received rain. This spring rain has alleviated the drought in the Southwest region, and the broad masses of farmers in various regions are intensely engaged in spring plowing.
    The country is about to enter a tense stage of comprehensive spring sowing. Although spring sowing in the northern provinces is not encountering significant difficulties, anti-drought work should still be carried out to ensure the smooth growth of seedlings after they emerge from the soil. According to past meteorological patterns, rainfall is generally low and evaporation is high in April, May, and June, and the threat of drought still exists. Last April, the southern provinces suffered significant losses due to continuous rain. Although rainfall is currently normal in most areas, anti-flood and anti-drought work cannot be relaxed in the slightest. All localities must seize the opportunity to quickly complete spring water conservancy projects, continue to massively and universally develop small-scale farmland water conservancy, and prevent all possible flood and drought disasters.

    今年春季大部分地区雨水调匀
    全国陆续开始春耕播种
    旱涝威胁仍然存在不能放松防旱防涝工作
    【本报讯】目前全国大部地区雨水调匀，各地春季播种工作已陆续开始。西北、华北、东北等地的春麦区，正在紧张播种。河南烟田大部分已经下种。长江流域正播种水稻，珠江流域已在插秧，海南岛早稻正抽穗开花。长江以北小麦产区，如山东、苏北、皖北、河南、平原、河北、山西、陕西等地，入春以来雨水较多；加以各地农民进行了耙锄保墒和增施追肥的工作，冬小麦一般生长良好。长城以北杂粮产区，今年春季雨量一般也都超过历年平均雨量，除个别地区稍显干旱外，春播不致发生困难。长江中下游，江西、湖北、皖南、苏南等地曾因春雨过多，天冷地寒，油菜、豌豆、小麦等春季作物遭受损害。三月中下旬陆续转晴以后，当地农民正在用开沟排水、锄草、施追肥等办法促进作物成长。广西、福建等省的部分地区曾因春雨过多，发生烂秧现象，三月中旬以来晴多雨少，情况已见好转。西南区各地连日普降春雨。旱象较严重的川北区在九日到十日获得四个月来第一次春雨，该区除北部山地下雨较小外，其他各县雨水渗地达五寸，水田增蓄春水一寸左右。川南大部地区也连续降雨，一般水田水深增加一寸。西康雅安、康定等专区，贵州省和云南省大理等专区都已先后获雨。这场春雨已使西南区的旱象减轻，各地广大农民正紧张地进行春耕中。
    全国即将进入全面春播的紧张阶段，北方各省虽然春播已无多大困难，但仍应开展防旱工作，以保证禾苗出土后顺利成长。根据以往的气象规律，四、五、六三个月内一般是雨量少，蒸发量大，干旱的威胁仍然是存在的。南方各省去年四月间曾因连续霪雨，造成很大损失，目前虽然大部地区雨量正常，但防涝防旱工作仍是不可丝毫放松。各地必须抓紧时机，迅速完成水利春修工程，继续大量普遍发展小型农田水利，防止一切可能发生的涝灾和干旱。
