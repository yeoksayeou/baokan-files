Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: According to TASS, Tokyo: The American military tribunal in Tokyo sentenced seven Japanese Communist Party members to penal servitude on April 3rd, falsely accusing them of "espionage" against the US military. The military tribunal sentenced defendant Maruyama Ichiro to seven years of penal servitude and a fine of $1,500, and Iida Nanao to six years of penal servitude and a fine of $1,000. The remaining defendants were sentenced to three to five years of penal servitude, with three of them also fined between $500 and $750.

According to the "Tokyo Shimbun": In his final statement in court, defense lawyer Aoyagi emphasized that the arrest and prosecution of these defendants were political in nature, aimed at suppressing Japanese democratic forces who oppose the Japanese government's and the United States' policies of rearming Japan and stationing US troops in Japan. Aoyagi said: The seven defendants are true patriots who hope for the liberation of Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: TASS, Tokyo, April 10th: The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party recently issued a statement protesting the US military tribunal's sentencing of Iida Nanao and seven other communists on charges of "anti-occupation activities."

The statement from the Provisional Central Guidance Department pointed out: The Japanese people have the right to oppose turning Japan into a military base, and also have the right to know the harm caused to the people by the establishment of military bases. The purpose of the verdict is to intimidate the Japanese people who are expressing great dissatisfaction with the Japan-US military agreements – the so-called "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement."

    日共发表声明指出日本人民有权反对国家军事基地化
    抗议美军事法庭非法判处饭田七三等苦役
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社东京讯：东京美国军事法庭在四月三日对七位日本共产党党员判处了苦役，他们被诬告对美军进行“间谍活动”。军事法庭判处被告丸山一郎七年苦役和一千五百美元的罚款，判处饭田七三六年苦役和一千美元的罚款。其余的被告被判处三年到五年的苦役，其中三人还被罚款五百到七百五十美元不等。
    据“东京新闻”说：辩护律师青柳在法庭上最后一次发言中强调说：对于这些被告的逮捕和起诉是具有政治性质的，其目的在于镇压那些反对日本政府和美国的重新武装日本以及使美国军队驻留日本的政策的日本民主力量。青柳说：七位被告是希望日本解放的真正爱国者。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社东京十日讯：日本共产党临时中央指导部顷发表声明，抗议美国军事法庭以“反占领活动”罪名判处饭田七三等七名共产党人。
    临时中央指导部的声明指出：日本人民有权反对把日本变为一个军事基地，也有权知道建立军事基地对人民所造成的损害。判决的目的是恫吓对于日美军事协定——所谓“安全条约”和“行政协定”——表示极大不满的日本人民。
