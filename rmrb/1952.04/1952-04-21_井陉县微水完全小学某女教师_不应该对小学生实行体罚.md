    Jingxing County Weishui Complete Primary School Female Teacher
    Should Not Inflict Corporal Punishment on Primary School Students
    To the Editor: Children are the flowers of our time, and all kind-hearted people care for and cherish them. However, a female teacher at Weishui Complete Primary School in Jingxing County, Hebei Province, on April 9th, actually beat four primary school students with a wooden stick. One of them, named Qi Junying, was beaten so badly that he cried and wet his pants. This is heartbreaking! Children's hearts are innocent and pure. As long as they are patiently taught, no matter how naughty they are, they can be educated well. But this female teacher at Weishui Complete Primary School is so rude, which is unacceptable. I think she should make a profound self-criticism in order to correct this barbaric method of educating children.
                                                                                                            Wang Jie

    井陉县微水完全小学某女教师
    不应该对小学生实行体罚
    编辑同志：儿童是时代的花朵，凡是心地善良的人们，无不关怀和爱护儿童。但是河北省井陉县微水完全小学有一位女教师，在四月九日，竟用木棍痛打四位小学生，其中有一个叫齐俊英的，竟被打得痛哭流涕，尿流满裤，这是多么令人欲痛心的事啊！儿童的心灵是天真纯洁的，只要耐心去教导，不管多调皮，也会教育好的，但微水完全小学这位女教师却如此粗暴，这是令人不能容忍的。我认为她应该深刻检讨，以期纠正这种野蛮的教育儿童的方法。    王杰
