In several areas of Shandong Province, grain storage departments have relaxed their grain storage work, resulting in serious problems such as insect infestation, heating, and mold in stored grain. The grain stored in six public grain warehouses in Huimin, Yangxin, and Wudi counties has reached a temperature as high as 36 degrees Celsius (currently, the normal temperature for grain should be around 13 degrees Celsius); pests such as grain weevils, sawtoothed grain beetles, and rice weevils have been found, with the most serious cases having more than 170 insects per jin of grain. In some public grain warehouses in Zhanhua County, wheat developed grain mites due to rising temperatures. In the Liujiagou and Beigou public grain warehouses in Penglai County, more than 360 jin of millet rotted; more than 300 jin of grain also rotted in the Bijiazhuang branch of the Zhaizi public grain warehouse in Zhangqiu County. In other areas such as Ju County, Xuzhou, Tongshan County, and Pi County, the phenomenon of insect infestation in stored grain in some public grain warehouses is also quite serious. The problem of dampness and deterioration of stored grain is also very serious in the Provincial Grain Company and its affiliated branches and sub-branches. Seventy-three bags of flour stored by the Jinan Grain Company were bitten by mice; 4,388 jin of corn from Northeast China stored by the company in the Chengji warehouse deteriorated due to high moisture content and lack of inspection for a long time. Of the Northeast grain received by the Qingdao Grain Branch Company, 3,866 jin were moldy and 11,674 jin deteriorated. The Mingshui Office of the Zhoucun Grain Branch Company received 1.26 million jin of corn from Northeast China with a moisture content as high as 22.9 percent. In addition, the quality of the grain was poor, with about 40 percent of it deteriorating and 5 percent becoming moldy. Similar phenomena have also occurred in the grain companies of other counties such as Huang County, Boshan, Laiyang, Tai'an, Huimin, Teng County, and Pingyuan.

The main reason for the insect infestation, heating, and mold in grain is that some grain storage cadres are ideologically negligent and have not implemented the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" in grain storage. In addition, during the "Three-Anti" campaign, some special districts and county grain bureaus relaxed their leadership over routine operations, and the passive work attitude of some dishonest cadres also contributed to grain losses.

After discovering the above situation, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Finance and Grain Bureau sent inspection teams to various places on March 9th. Currently, some areas are organizing forces to inspect grain depots or are starting to turn the grain to ventilate it and eliminate pests. For example, Gaomi County has conducted a comprehensive warehouse inspection, ventilated the public grain with high moisture content, and reduced the moisture content of beans stored in the county by 5 to 10 percent. Xuzhou City has adopted the method of open-air storage and night cooling for insect-infested sorghum, reducing the grain temperature from 21 degrees Celsius to 3 degrees Celsius, which stopped the development of insect pests. However, the phenomenon of insect infestation and mold in public grain is still occurring in many areas. This should attract the close attention of local leading organs and grain storage departments. In particular, grain companies in various regions should immediately extract a certain amount of manpower, conduct in-depth inspections, and quickly strengthen grain storage work.

    山东若干地区大批粮食遭受虫蚀霉烂
    财政厅粮食局已派出检查组到各地检查纠正这种现象
    山东省若干地区的粮食保管部门，放松了存粮保管工作，发生存粮虫蚀、发热、霉烂等严重现象。惠民、阳信、无棣三县六个公粮仓库的存粮，温度都高达摄氏三十六度（按目前粮食正常温度应在摄氏十三度左右）；并发现谷蠹、锯谷盗、米象等害虫，最严重的一斤粮食中就有虫子一百七十多个。沾化县有的公粮仓库麦粮因气温上升而发生粉螨。蓬莱县刘家沟和北沟公粮仓库霉烂了谷子三百六十多斤；章邱县寨子公粮仓库毕家庄分仓也霉烂粮食三百多斤。其他如莒县、徐州、铜山县、邳县等地部分公粮仓库，存粮遭受虫蚀的现象都相当严重。省粮食公司及所属各分、支公司存粮的受潮、变质现象也很严重。济南粮食公司所存面粉被老鼠咬破七十三袋；这个公司存入成记仓库的东北玉米，因水分较大，而且很长时期没有检查，也有四千三百八十八斤变坏了。青岛粮食分公司接收的东北粮中，霉烂了三千八百六十六斤，变质了一万一千六百七十四斤。周村粮食分公司所属明水办事处接收东北的玉米一百二十六万斤，水分高达百分之二十二点九，再加粮食质量较坏，其中约有百分之四十变质，百分之五霉烂。其他如黄县、博山、莱阳、泰安、惠民、滕县、平原等县粮食公司，也有同样现象发生。
    粮食遭虫蚀、发热、霉烂的主要原因，是某些粮食保管干部思想上麻痹大意，没有贯彻保管粮食的“防重于治”的方针。此外，在“三反”运动中，有些专署和县粮食局放松了经常业务的领导，以及某些手面不干净的干部工作态度消极，也是造成粮食损失的原因。
    山东省人民政府财政厅粮食局发现以上情况后，已在三月九日派出检查组，分赴各地进行检查。目前，部分地区正在组织力量检查粮仓或着手倒仓出风、消灭害虫。如高密县已进行了全面的查仓，对水分多的公粮通了风，使全县仓存豆子水分降低了百分之五至百分之十。徐州市对虫蚀的高粱，采取露天储存和夜间凉冻的办法，使粮温由摄氏二十一度降至三度，停止了虫害的发展。但还有很多地区公粮遭受虫蚀和霉烂的现象仍不断发生。这应引起各地领导机关及粮食保管部门密切注意。特别是各地粮食公司，应立即抽出一定力量，深入检查，迅速加强粮食保管工作。
