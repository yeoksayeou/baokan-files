Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative Writes to the Central Ministry of Agriculture
    Determined to Complete and Strive to Exceed This Year's Patriotic Production Increase Plan

Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture:

    We have seen the list of the first group of 1951 agricultural bumper harvest models awarded by the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture on March 16th. The Central Ministry of Agriculture awarded our mutual aid team (now reorganized into an agricultural production cooperative) a certificate of merit, bonus, and medal, which made us feel infinitely honored. All members of our agricultural production cooperative extend our highest respect and infinite gratitude to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government. This kind of honor was unimaginable in the old society. In the old society, we worked hard all year round, but we lived a miserable life of hunger and cold every year. Now the Communist Party and the People's Government are leading us to organize, and they are giving us great assistance in all aspects, which enables us to produce more grain and live a better life. We are truly unable to express our gratitude; we never thought that the government would give us such a great reward and such a high honor. We believe that our glory belongs to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and all the working people. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government can we be determined to do a good job in our agricultural production cooperative, make a hundred times more effort, work diligently, and study technology, in order to complete and strive to exceed the 1952 production increase plan, and create higher new records of bumper harvests, to repay the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government for their concern and hope for us. We have decided to use all of the 5 million yuan bonus awarded to us by the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture for production, as the common property of our agricultural production cooperative. Our specific plan is: to buy 50 sheep with 3 million yuan, 2 cows with 1.2 million yuan, 13 piglets, 2 sows, and 1 boar with 800,000 yuan. This will not only breed livestock, but also increase fertilizer, so as to better complete and strive to exceed this year's patriotic production increase plan. In addition, we must strengthen political study, raise our awareness, do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, oppose the brutal crimes of US imperialism in spreading bacteria to poison the people of China and Korea, and fight to the end to defeat US imperialist aggression.

                     Li Shunda and all members of the Agricultural Production Cooperative

    李顺达农业生产合作社写信给中央农业部
    决心完成并争取超过今年的爱国增产计划中央人民政府农业部：
    我们看到了中央人民政府农业部三月十六日颁发的一九五一年农业丰产模范第一批受奖名单。中央农业部奖给了我们互助组（现已改组为农业生产合作社）的奖状、奖金和奖章，使我们感到无限光荣。我们全体农业生产合作社社员向共产党、毛主席、人民政府致以崇高的敬礼和无限的感谢。这种光荣，在旧社会是想也想不到的。我们在旧社会终年劳动，但年年过着忍饥挨冻的凄惨生活。现在共产党和人民政府领导我们组织起来，并在各方面给我们很大的援助，使我们多打了粮食，过好了光景，我们真是无法感谢；想不到政府又给予我们这么大的奖励和这么高的光荣。我们认为我们的光荣是属于共产党、毛主席的，是属于全体劳动人民的。我们只有在共产党、毛主席和人民政府领导下，决心搞好我们的农业生产合作社，百倍努力，辛勤劳动，钻研技术，以完成并争取超过一九五二年的增产计划，创造更高的丰产新纪录，来报答共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府对我们的关怀和希望。我们决定把中央人民政府农业部奖给我们的五百万元奖金全部用在生产上，作为我们农业生产合作社的公有财产。我们的具体计划是：以三百万元买羊五十只，以一百二十万元买母牛两头，以八十万元买小猪十三口、大母猪两口、大公猪一口，这样既能繁殖牲畜，又能增加肥料，以便更好地完成并争取超过今年的爱国增产计划。此外，我们更要加强政治学习，提高觉悟，做好抗美援朝工作，反对美帝国主义撒播细菌毒害中朝人民的残暴罪行，为打败美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗到底。
                    李顺达和农业生产合作社全体社员
