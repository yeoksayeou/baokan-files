Welcome the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble to Perform in China
Vice Chairman of the All-China Dance Workers Association Wu Xiaobang

A month ago, when we heard that the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble would be performing in Beijing, we Chinese dance workers were very excited. Because the members of this ensemble are mostly selected from the working people of Hungary, they are the most outstanding actors in Hungary, including singers, instrumentalists, and dancers. Now, on behalf of the comrades of the All-China Dance Workers Association, and in order to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, I extend a warm welcome to the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble.

Due to the implementation of Hungary's Five-Year Plan, mass cultural activities have been widely and enthusiastically launched, and singing and dancing activities in Hungary's rural areas and factories have flourished. There are now three thousand amateur worker-peasant singing and dancing groups in Hungary, including more than 50,000 singing and dancing workers.

Under the wise leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government, a high tide of cultural construction has been set off throughout Hungary. Every year, many talented and young singing and dancing experts are selected during the national cultural competition.

The programs they perform in China, whether singing, dancing, or instrumental performance, will leave us with a deep impression. They use their own national forms to convey the Hungarian people's love of peace and freedom. They love their lives and fully express the Hungarian people's joyful emotions through their performances. Their own excellent national customs and the new ideas and feelings of the people in the construction of the great Five-Year Plan are completely integrated. For example, in the dance "Ekser Wedding," it fully illustrates how Hungarian artists love their lives (faithfully use dance to reflect their happy lives in the process of nation-building) and love their nation. Just through a scene of "wedding," it is enough for us to see how happy the new life of the Hungarian people is today. In the "Tribute Dance," their dancers use ancient rituals to express their lives today: during major festivals, they enthusiastically contribute their wealth as a tribute to their beloved leader and their most beloved people. In this dance, we see the Hungarian people's healthy, loyal, simple, and proud qualities, which are admirable. Now they have arranged this dance to be performed at the welcoming ceremony as a tribute from the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. In the program "Bottle Dance," the female dancers of the Hungarian people have choreographed some of the customs of certain places in Hungary into a dance. From this program, we seem to see how the new Hungarian people are celebrating their harvest, and the innocent and lovely girls are working happily on the free Hungarian land with bottles full of wine on their heads. This is the most beautiful dance, it symbolizes a picture of a happy life in the new society. The program "Rhythm Dance," I guess, is probably a dance preserved from the nomadic customs of Hungary, belonging to the type of Tatar dance. This dance was a dance that every man had to learn at that time in order to prevent the lower body from being whipped during a duel (in the old customs, the whip was not allowed to hit the upper body). The technique of this dance is quite high and it is exciting to watch. In short, in their dance programs, we can always see the new life atmosphere among the people and the people's strong feelings of love for the new life and love for labor.

In the orchestra's performance, the music of many programs is very clear and moving. The singers' singing also makes people feel the national characteristics unique to the Hungarian nation.

The performance of the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble in China is helpful to the construction and development of Chinese art dance.

Finally, I wish all members of the Hungarian National People's Folk Ensemble victory and health!

    欢迎匈牙利国家人民文工团来中国演出
    中华全国舞蹈工作者协会副主席  吴晓邦
    一个月前，当听到匈牙利国家人民文工团将要到北京演出的消息时，我们中国的舞蹈工作者非常兴奋。因为，这一个文工团的成员，大部分是在匈牙利劳动人民中选出来的，是全匈最优秀的演员，其中有歌唱家、演奏家和舞蹈家。现在，我代表中华全国舞蹈工作者协会的同志们，为了加强中匈两国人民的友谊，向匈牙利国家人民文工团表示热烈欢迎。
    由于匈牙利五年计划的实施，群众性的文化活动已普遍、热烈展开，匈牙利的农村和工厂内的歌舞活动已蓬勃发展起来。现在匈牙利有三千个业余的工农群众的歌舞团体，包括了五万以上的歌舞工作者。
    在劳动人民党和政府的英明领导下，整个匈牙利掀起了文化建设的高潮。每年全国举行文化竞赛运动时，都选出很多天才的和年青的歌舞专家来。
    他们在中国所演出的节目，无论是歌唱、舞蹈和演奏都会留给我们深刻的印象。他们用自己民族的形式，来传达匈牙利人民爱好和平和自由的情绪。他们热爱自己的生活，通过演出，把匈牙利人民的欢快情绪，充分地表现出来。他们自己民族优良的风俗习惯，和他们在伟大五年计划建设中人民的新思想新感情是完全融洽的。比如在“艾克塞婚礼”的一个舞蹈内，那是充分说明了，匈牙利的艺术家是如何热爱他们的生活（忠实地用舞蹈去反映他们在建国过程中愉快的生活）和热爱自己的民族。仅仅通过了一段“婚礼”的场面，就足够使我们看到今天匈牙利人民的新生活是多么幸福。在“献礼舞”内，他们的舞蹈家利用了古代的仪式，表现了他们今天的生活：在重大节日内，热情地去贡献出自己的财物来，作为献给他们敬爱的领袖和自己最敬爱的人物。在这一个舞蹈内，我们看到了匈牙利人民的健康、忠诚、朴素和自豪的品质来，令人会对它肃然起敬。现在他们把这一个舞蹈，安排在欢迎会上演出，作为匈牙利国家人民文工团向中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席献礼的舞蹈。在“瓶舞”这一个节目内，匈牙利人民的女舞蹈家们，把匈牙利某些地方的风俗习惯编成舞蹈。我们从这一个节目内，仿佛看到了新的匈牙利人民如何在庆祝他们的丰收，而天真可爱的姑娘们头顶着满贮酒浆的瓶子，无限愉快地在自由的匈牙利土地上劳动着。这是一个最美丽的舞蹈，它象征了新社会幸福生活的图景。“节奏舞”这一个节目，据我猜想，大概是匈牙利还远在游牧生活风俗中所保存下来的舞蹈，属于鞸鞑舞的一类。这种舞是当时每一个男子所必须学习的，他们为了防止在决斗时下身不致被长鞭所抽打的一种舞蹈（旧风俗中不准鞭子抽到上身去）。这一个舞蹈的技术是相当高的，看时令人兴奋。总之，在他们的舞蹈节目内，随时看到了人民中间新的生活气息和人民强烈的热爱新生活、热爱劳动的感情。
    在乐队的演奏中，许多节目的音乐是十分明朗动人的。歌唱家的歌唱，也使人感到匈牙利民族所独具有的民族特色。
    匈牙利国家人民文工团在中国的演出，对于中国艺术舞蹈的建设、发展，是有帮助的。
    最后敬祝匈牙利国家人民文工团全体团员们胜利，健康！
