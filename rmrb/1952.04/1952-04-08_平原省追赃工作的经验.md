This newspaper's comprehensive draft

The large-scale movement of verification and confiscation of赃物 in Pingyuan Province, North China, has achieved great results. Since mid-March, the "Three-Anti" movement in Pingyuan Province's county-level and above organs and organizations has largely shifted to the struggle of verifying materials and returning赃款 and赃物. Some continued to catch "tigers" while simultaneously pursuing the return of赃物, completing the process in one go. According to statistics from Xinxiang and Anyang prefectures, the recovered赃款 and赃物 have reached over 8.4 billion yuan. In Wuzhi and Qinyang counties, after a退赃 conference, a group of embezzlers returned more than 1.5 billion yuan of赃款.

The development of this struggle in various regions was based on existing experience in catching "tigers." It involved purifying the command, rectifying the ranks, overcoming right-leaning sentiments within the ranks, fully recognizing the importance, arduousness, and complexity of the struggle, and clarifying policies before proceeding.

The situation of verified materials in various parts of Pingyuan Province shows that the destinations of embezzled goods of corrupt elements are very complex and involve a wide range of aspects. In Anyang County, several major embezzlers embezzled a total of more than 900 million yuan, with over 800 million yuan invested in industry and commerce, and only over 99.2 million yuan in rural areas. In Yuanyang County, several embezzlers embezzled a total of 280 million yuan, some of which was invested in industry and commerce, and some in buying land, houses, and lending money in rural areas. Those who invest in commerce are generally people in or close to that industry. Embezzlers who purchase cotton often invest the embezzled funds in private cotton firms. Those who invest in stores in other cities have stocks and hold赃据 (receipts for ill-gotten gains). In the local towns, some have no formal stocks, but the accounts have code names or trade names. Some use surnames as code names, some use names as trade names, and some use other code names or pseudonyms, and they themselves keep secret accounts. The investigation and verification in various places also shows that the situation is complicated and merchants are cunning when embezzlers invest赃款 in industry and commerce. Embezzlers from local peasant backgrounds are generally "short-legged" and have few connections. Some hoard materials after embezzling; some engage in usury, making debtors jointly guarantee, and write contracts using land as collateral; some invest in sideline production; some buy land, livestock, and build houses; some entrust relatives to buy land in order not to expose their targets. Careful investigation and verification work has corrected the right-leaning thoughts of many cadres. For example, at the beginning, some people said: "We have caught all the tigers. It's right for the leadership to deal with them according to policy. Why should we continue to do anything?" The investigation and verification work made them clearly realize that investigation, verification, and returning赃物 and赃款 are the most acute, most complex, and most arduous struggles, and at the same time, they are struggles that have a decisive impact on the success or failure of the entire "Three-Anti" movement.

On the basis of full and accurate investigation and verification work, after careful preparation, holding a追赃交证 (confiscation and verification) struggle rally, explaining policies, and clearly distinguishing between leniency and severity is an important step in leading the "Three-Anti" movement to victory. Before the追赃 struggle rally, the counties in Xinxiang Prefecture did preparatory work for the追赃 struggle among the masses, calling on embezzlers to formulate退赃 plans. It was announced at the conference that only returning赃物 is a concrete manifestation of thorough confession and determination to repent, and can be treated with leniency; those who resist and deny will be severely punished, which greatly promoted the缴赃 (handing over赃物) movement. At the追赃交证 struggle rally in Wuzhi and Qinyang counties in the prefecture, a group of embezzlers returned 780 million yuan of赃款, and another group returned more than 740 million yuan after the meeting. Anyang Prefecture's counties combined "tiger" catching with退赃交证 work, taking thoroughness and completion in one go as the guiding principle, and recovered 5,297,700,000 yuan of赃款. At the追赃交证 struggle rally in Anyang County, Li Fenglin, an embezzler who handed over all the赃款 and赃物 on the spot, and Li Yujun, an embezzler who handed over part of the赃款 on the spot and expressed his guarantee to return all the赃款 within a limited time and strive to atone for his crimes, were exempted from criminal punishment and treated with leniency. At the same time, Duan Guangfu and Ma Xiaotian, major embezzlers who repeatedly overturned their cases, used false pretenses, and remained cunning and denied in the face of witnesses and material evidence, and refused to hand over赃物, were arrested and dealt with according to law on the spot. Within three days after the meeting, the county recovered more than 700 million yuan of赃物.

Doing a good job in the work of family members is an important part of the追赃退赃交证 struggle movement. Many embezzlers believe that their crimes are serious, fearing that they will lose both money and life, and firmly refuse to hand over赃物. Thinking, "If I die, not handing over赃物 can still support the whole family." Some embezzlers also confessed to the赃款 and赃物 hidden at home, but their family members refused to hand them over, either because they were afraid of implicating themselves or because they were afraid that their husband's, father's, or brother's crimes would be aggravated. Therefore, the organs and organizations in Pingyuan Province universally paid attention to the work of family members, patiently educating them according to different situations, repeatedly explaining policies, mobilizing them to help recover赃物, and persuading embezzlers. After Bo'ai County held a forum for family members to explain policies, Wang Zhaolin, an embezzler from the stone printing bureau, still firmly refused to confess the whereabouts of赃款, but his wife revealed the贓物 under the influence of the policy. Wang Jing'an, an embezzler from the Pingyuan Provincial Livestock Company, placed the赃款 and赃物 with his wife, Li Shuying. When the working cadres went to her home to verify, she initially firmly denied it and said that Wang Jing'an was slandering her. At that time, her only concern was fear of implicating her. When the working cadres told her that if she did not hand over the hidden赃款 and赃物, her husband could not be treated with leniency by the people's government, she confessed all the赃款 she had deposited in the bank and the materials she had bought with the赃款.

    平原省追赃工作的经验
    本报综合稿
    华北区平原省大规模的对证、追赃运动，已取得很大成绩。自三月中旬起，平原省县级以上机关团体的“三反”运动，即大部转入对证材料、追退赃款的斗争。有的继续捉“虎”，同时追退赃物，一气呵成。根据新乡、安阳两个专区的统计，追回的赃款、赃物已达八十四亿元以上。武陟、沁阳两县在一个退赃大会前后，一批贪污分子就退出了赃款十五亿元多。
    各地开展这一斗争，是在已有捉“虎”经验的基础上，纯洁指挥部，整顿队伍，克服队伍中的右倾情绪，充分认识斗争的重要意义和艰苦性、复杂性，明确政策后进行的。
    平原省各地对证材料的情况说明：贪污分子们的赃物去路很复杂，波及的方面也很广。安阳县有几个大贪污分子共贪污了九亿多元，投入工商业的占八亿多元，在农村的仅占九千二百多万元。原阳县有几个贪污分子共贪污两亿八千万元，其中有的投资工商业；有的在农村买土地、房屋和放债。投资于商业的，一般是那行人或接近那行的人投入那行。采购棉花的贪污分子，多将贪污款项投入私人花行。投资于其他城市商店中的都有股票，持有赃据。在本城镇的有的无正式股票，但账上有代号或堂号，有的用姓氏做代号，有的用名字做堂号，也有另起代号或假名的，本人藏有暗账。各地调查对证的情况同时说明：凡是贪污分子将赃款投入工商业的，情况复杂，商人狡赖。本地农民出身的贪污分子，一般的是“腿短”，关系少。有的贪污后囤积物资；有的放高利贷，让债户做连环保，写契约用土地做抵押；有的投入副业生产；有的买土地、牲畜、修盖房屋；有的为着不暴露目标，托亲戚买地。细密的调查对证工作，纠正了不少干部中的右倾思想。如开始时有的人说：“老虎都被我们捉住了，领导上按政策处理就对了，还要我们继续搞啥呢？”调查对证工作，使他们清楚地认识到：调查对证、追交赃物赃款，乃是最尖锐、最复杂、最艰苦的斗争，同时也是对整个“三反”运动的成败具有决定意义的斗争。
    在充分的、确切的调查对证工作的基础上，经过周密准备，然后举行追赃交证斗争大会，讲明政策，宽严分明，是将“三反”运动引向胜利的重要步骤。新乡专区各县在追赃斗争大会以前，在群众中做了追赃斗争的准备工作，号召贪污分子制订退赃计划。在大会上宣布：只有退出赃物才是彻底坦白和决心悔过的具体表现，才能宽大处理；对顽抗、抵赖者决从严惩处，这就大大推动了缴赃运动。该专区武陟、沁阳两县的追赃交证斗争大会上，有一批贪污分子退赃七亿八千万元，会后又有一批退出七亿四千余万元。安阳专区各县打“虎”和退赃交证工作相结合，以打透打净、一气呵成为方针，追退赃款五十二亿九千七百余万元。安阳县追赃交证斗争大会上，对当场交出全部赃款赃物的贪污分子李凤林，和当场交出一部分赃款并表示在限期内保证退出全部赃款，争取立功赎罪的贪污分子李玉俊，均免于刑事处分，从宽处理。同时将屡次翻案，以假掩真，在人证物证面前仍然狡猾抵赖，拒不交赃的大贪污分子段广福、马晓田当场逮捕法办。会后三天内，全县追退赃物共达七亿元多。
    做好家属工作，是追赃退赃交证斗争运动的重要一环。不少贪污分子认为自己罪恶重大，怕落个人财两空，坚不交赃。想着“我死了，不交赃还可以养全家”。也有的贪污分子自己说出了藏在家中的赃款赃物，而家属或因怕牵连自己，或怕自己的丈夫父兄罪过加重，因而不肯交出。因此，平原省各机关团体普遍地注意了家属工作，根据不同情况，耐心地进行教育，反复地讲明政策，动员她们帮助追赃，并对贪污分子进行规劝。博爱县召开家属座谈会讲明政策后，石印局贪污分子王朝林本人虽仍坚决不交代赃款下落，但其妻子在政策的感召下说出了赃物。平原省畜产公司贪污分子王静安将赃款赃物放在他妻子李淑英处，当工作干部到她家对证时，她开始坚决不承认，并说王静安血口喷人，诬赖她。当时她唯一的顾虑是怕连累她。当工作干部告诉她如不交出隐藏的赃款赃物，就不能使自己的丈夫获得人民政府的宽大处理时，她就把存放在银行里的赃款和用赃款买的物资全部做了交代。
