Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 31st: At the staff meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side, while continuing to unreasonably oppose our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation, also attempted to tamper with history and distort facts in the discussion of the wording of the draft armistice agreement. They unreasonably demanded that the term "Korea" in the Korean and Chinese versions of the draft armistice agreement should be replaced with the so-called "South Korea." Furthermore, they insisted on replacing the correct translation of "United Nations Forces" with the name "International United Army" in the Korean version of the draft agreement. This absurd attitude of the US side, creating extraneous obstacles, once again exposed the US's premeditated conspiracy to obstruct and delay the armistice negotiations, and to attempt to expand the war of aggression.

The US side's request to replace "Korea" with "South Korea" is an absurd and enormous insult to the Korean people. The name Korea has a long history. At the beginning of the Korean nation's founding, the Korean people called their own country "Korea," and this name was used for a very long period. Ancient Chinese books, such as the "Historical Records" written by Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty, also referred to it as Korea. Only during the ten years or so from 1897 to 1910, when Japanese imperialism began to control Korea in place of the Manchu Qing government, at the instigation of Japanese imperialists, the country's name was changed to "Daehan," which is the so-called "South Korea." After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established, and the name Korea continued to be used by the Korean people and understood and recognized by the Chinese people and the people of the world. Only the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man puppet gang under their wing call themselves the "Republic of Korea" or "South Korea." Even the United Press International Tokyo dispatch of the 30th had to admit that "South Korea" is a "term" used by the "South Korean government." Today, all Korean people with national self-esteem despise the name "South Korea" because it is inseparable from the history of Japanese imperialism's aggression against Korea in the 19th century, and it has now become synonymous with the Lee Seung-man puppet gang. The US side's unreasonable request to replace "Korea" with "South Korea" in the Korean and Chinese versions of the armistice agreement is clearly a vain attempt to use this broken signboard of the ugly "Republic of Korea," which is despised by the Korean people, to elevate its status.

After the US side made this unreasonable request, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, our side fairly and reasonably suggested that the issues of the terms "Korea" and "United Nations Forces" be resolved simultaneously. Our side agreed with the US side's opinion on the Korean translation of its own name, but the US side must respect our side's correct use of the name "Korea." Despite this, the US side disregarded our side's concession and continued to insist on using the term "South Korea," thereby unreasonably hindering the progress of the negotiations.

As everyone knows, the negotiations on the third item have been going on for a full four months since they began on November 27th last year. Because the US side has consistently adopted the bad tactics of sabotage, obstruction, and delay, the third item has not yet been fully agreed upon. On the issues of military personnel rotation, specific rear area ports, nomination of neutral nations, and construction of airports, the US side has consistently adhered to its unreasonable demands. Although, with our side's continuous efforts, the first two issues were agreed upon after a long period of debate, the latter two issues have remained unresolved to this day due to the US side's unreasonable opposition to the Soviet Union as a neutral nation and its insistence on interfering in our internal affairs. Now, the US side has created new obstacles, making a mountain out of a molehill, and creating a so-called "name" issue. What other explanation can there be besides proving that the US side is deliberately obstructing, delaying, and even sabotaging the armistice negotiations?

The US aggressors' evil conspiracy to continue to obstruct, delay, and even sabotage the armistice negotiations, and to artificially stimulate their own and their vassal states to prepare for war, has been confirmed by more and more opinions within the US ruling group. The "Christian Science Monitor" of the United States revealed on March 13 that the purpose of the US ruling group's continued delay of the Korean armistice negotiations is to create a tense atmosphere in order to urge its Western European vassal states to step up the establishment of the North Atlantic aggressive army and step up interference in the Vietnamese people's liberation war. The newspaper said: The US aggression group is worried that "if the United States were to forcibly achieve peace in Korea, it might overturn the current plan to complete the new North Atlantic organization and the European Defense Command"; at the same time, they believe that "the current stalemate in the Panmunjom negotiations provides time to try to seek the correct solution to the Vietnam problem." Therefore, "Washington policymakers" have come to the "conclusion" that "at the very least, a slight delay (in the Korean armistice negotiations) can create an opportunity to try to resolve the Vietnam problem and consolidate the European alliance mechanism." The American Catholic weekly "America" also frankly admitted that the Korean War "is a stimulus to accelerate our own military buildup and make the North Atlantic Treaty Organization more energetic." The US conspiracy to obstruct and delay the armistice negotiations has once again been nakedly exposed to the world.

We absolutely do not allow the decadent term "South Korea" to replace the universally recognized name "Korea"; we also resolutely oppose the US side's bad tactics of creating extraneous obstacles and making a mountain out of a molehill to obstruct and delay the negotiations. Only in this way is it possible to reach an agreement on the third item of the agenda. It can be said with certainty that any conspiracy or trick of the US aggressors to delay and obstruct the armistice negotiations will be futile. The Korean and Chinese people, together with the people of the world, have the confidence and strength to smash all the tricks of the warmongers.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 1st: At the staff meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations on April 1st, our side pointed out: Our side originally hoped to resolve all the outstanding issues of the third item of the agenda at the staff meeting. However, because the other side has consistently insisted on unreasonably opposing our nomination, which fully meets the definition of a neutral nation, at the staff meeting; and further created extraneous obstacles by raising technical wording issues that had already been agreed upon, contradicting the other side's own previous statements and submitted documents, and unreasonably opposing the correct use of the term "Korea," while insisting on using the term "South Korea" in the armistice agreement. This has forced our side to believe that continuing the staff meeting has lost its effectiveness, and to suggest that all resolved and unresolved issues be submitted to the subcommittee on the third item of the agenda. The other side agreed to convene a subcommittee meeting on April 3rd. The staff meeting will continue on April 2nd. At the staff meeting on the fourth item, the two sides continued to exchange views on the issue of repatriation principles.

### 美方坚持使用“韩国”这一荒谬腐朽字样  再度暴露美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋  我方建议召开停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会

    美方坚持使用“韩国”这一荒谬腐朽字样
    再度暴露美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋
    我方建议召开停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会
    【新华社开城三十一日电】在朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，美方在继续无理反对我方提名苏联为中立国的同时，在关于停战协定草案的文字的讨论中，竟又妄图篡改历史，歪曲事实，无理要求在朝文和中文的停战协定草案中应作“朝鲜”的地方，使用所谓“韩国”的字样；并坚持在朝文的协定草案中，以“国际联合军”的名称来代替“联合国军”这一正确的译名。美方这一节外生枝的荒唐态度，再次暴露了美方处心积虑地阻挠和拖延停战谈判，妄图扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    美方以“韩国”字样来代替“朝鲜”的要求，是荒谬绝伦的对于朝鲜人民的莫大侮辱。朝鲜这一名称，具有悠久的历史。在朝鲜民族建国之初，朝鲜人民就称他们自己的国家为“朝鲜”，这个名称并且沿用了很长的时期。中国的古籍，例如汉朝司马迁写的史记，也都称之为朝鲜。即使美联社汶山二十九日电也承认：“‘朝鲜’是古时的名称”。朝鲜的历代王朝中，仅在公元一八九七年到一九一○年的十余年间，也就是日本帝国主义开始代替满清政府来控制朝鲜的期间，在日本帝国主义者的授意之下，国号被改为“大韩”，也就是所谓“韩国”。日本帝国主义投降后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立，朝鲜这个名称继续为朝鲜人民所使用，并且为中国人民和世界人民所了解和公认。唯有美国侵略者和他卵翼下的李承晚傀儡匪帮才自称为“大韩民国”或“韩国”，甚至合众社东京三十日电也不得不承认：“韩国”是“南朝鲜政府”使用的“名词”。今天，有民族自尊心的朝鲜人民，无不鄙视“韩国”这一名称，因为它和十九世纪日本帝国主义侵略朝鲜的历史是分不开的，而且现在已经成为李承晚傀儡匪帮的代名词了。美方无理要求在朝文和中文的停战协定草案中以“韩国”代替“朝鲜”，显然妄想借此抬出为朝鲜人民所不齿的丑恶的“大韩民国”这块破招牌来。
    在美方提出这一无理要求之后，我方为了使谈判能够顺利进行，公平合理地建议把“朝鲜”和“联合国军”这两个名词的问题同时解决。我方同意美方对于它本身的名称的朝文译文的意见，但美方必须尊重我方对于“朝鲜”这一名称的正确使用。尽管如此，美方竟不顾我方的让步，继续坚持要求使用“韩国”的字样，从而无理地阻挠了谈判的进展。
    大家知道，第三项议程的谈判自从去年十一月二十七日开始以来，已经整整四个月了，由于美方始终采取破坏、阻挠和拖延的恶劣手法，使第三项议程至今仍未能取得全部协议。在军事人员轮换、特定后方口岸、中立国提名和修建机场诸问题上，美方一贯坚持其无理的要求。虽在我方不断的努力下，前两个问题经过长时期的争论后获得了协议，但后两个问题，由于美方无理反对苏联为中立国，并坚持干涉我国内政，迄今还是悬而未决。现在，美方竟又横生枝节，小题大做，硬制造出一个所谓“名称”问题。这除了证明美方蓄意阻挠、拖延停战谈判以外，难道还能有任何别的解释吗？
    美国侵略者企图继续阻挠、拖延甚至破坏停战谈判，人为地刺激它自己和它的仆从国家进行战争准备的罪恶阴谋，已由愈来愈多的美国统治集团的舆论所证实。三月十三日美国“基督教科学箴言报”透露，美国统治集团继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判的目的，是为了制造紧张的空气，借图催促其西欧仆从国家加紧建立北大西洋侵略军和加紧干涉越南人民的解放战争。该报说：美国侵略集团担心：“假若美国要勉强在朝鲜实现和平，就可能推翻完成新的北大西洋组织和欧洲防御司令部机构的目前计划”；同时，它们又认为：“目前板门店谈判的拖延不决，提供了企图寻求越南问题的正确解决办法的时间。”因此，“华盛顿的决策者们”得出“结论”，认为“至少至少，略微拖延一下（朝鲜停战谈判），可以造成一个机会，以试图解决越南问题及巩固欧洲的联盟机构”。美国天主教的周刊“美国”也率直地承认：朝鲜战争“就是加速我们自己军备和促使北大西洋公约组织有更多生气的刺激物”。美国阻挠和拖延停战谈判的阴谋再次在全世界面前赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    我们绝对不允许用“韩国”这样腐朽的字眼来代替“朝鲜”这一公认的名称；我们也坚决反对美方节外生枝、小题大做的阻挠和拖延谈判的恶劣手法。唯有这样，第三项议程才有达成协议的可能。可以肯定地说，美国侵略者拖延和阻挠停战谈判的任何阴谋诡计都是徒劳无益的，朝中人民和全世界人民一道，有信心和力量粉碎战争贩子的一切鬼蜮伎俩。
    【新华社开城一日电】四月一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方指出：我方原希望在参谋会议上解决所有第三项议程的未决问题，但由于对方在参谋会议上始终坚持无理反对我方所提出的完全合乎中立国定义的提名；更节外生枝地提出了早经同意的技术性文字问题，与对方本身以往的发言，和交来的文件自相矛盾，毫无理由地反对“朝鲜”这一名词的正确使用，而坚持在停战协定中使用“韩国”的字样。这就使我方不得不认为继续进行参谋会议已经失去了效用，而不得不建议将一切已决及未决问题，提交第三项议程小组委员会。对方同意在四月三日召开小组委员会会议。参谋会议将在四月二日继续举行。第四项议程参谋会议上，双方继续就遣俘原则问题交换意见。
