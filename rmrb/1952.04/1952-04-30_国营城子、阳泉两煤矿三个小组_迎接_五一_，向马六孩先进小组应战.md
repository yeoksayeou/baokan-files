    State-owned Chengzi and Yangquan Coal Mines, Three Teams
    Respond to "May Day" by Challenging the Ma Liuhai Advanced Team
    Editor: As the great festival of the working class – "May Day" International Labor Day – approaches, we specifically propose a friendly challenge to the Ma Liuhai Rapid Excavation Team.
    In January of this year, we went to Datong to learn the advanced production methods of the Ma Liuhai team – the multi-hole cycle operation method. After we returned and experimented with it, we have already achieved preliminary results. Team Three has increased from a past daily advance of 3.5 to 4 meters to 14.6 meters; Team Twelve has also made significant improvements. The conditions where we work are not very good. Team Three is operating in a single groove, and the roof and floor of each hole have 30 to 40 centimeters of rock, and the roof often collapses, so there is a risk of accidents if the supports cannot keep up. The place where we work is 610 meters away from the transportation roadway. Team Twelve is operating in three grooves, and the coal seam thickness is 0.4 meters to 2 meters, but it often changes. The air roadway is full of stones, the bottom plate of the main roadway has 80 centimeters of rock, and there is a lot of dripping water. Even so, we are determined to overcome these difficulties and achieve the conditions of our challenge. We also propose that Team Three create a new record of a daily advance of 20 meters, and Team Twelve create a new record of a daily advance of 15 meters, as a gift to Chairman Mao to welcome "May Day" Labor Day.
    Our challenge conditions: (1) Eliminate deaths and serious injuries, and reduce minor injuries; (2) Team Three guarantees a daily advance of 18 meters, and Team Twelve guarantees a daily advance of 12 meters; (3) Guarantee enough of 25 shifts per month, and abide by various systems; (4) Guarantee quality, engineering specifications and the use of standard operating methods; (5) Take care of tools, save explosives, avoid using large materials for small purposes, and Team Three guarantees that one new drill bit can mine 800 tons of coal; (6) Persist in weekly technical learning, and hold group meetings every week to exchange experiences.

    Editor: The great "May Day" Labor Day is coming. We have decided to challenge the Ma Liuhai advanced team. In January of this year, we learned from the Ma Liuhai team about their safe production experience and rapid excavation work methods. We brought back the conditions of their challenge to the entire North China coal mines and conveyed them to every worker. All the workers in our team actively responded to the call for increased production and frugality, and combined with the specific situation of our team, we propose the following conditions for a friendly challenge to them:
    We guarantee to complete the production tasks given by the state under safe conditions, and strive to exceed the task by 10%; guarantee to create wealth worth more than 184,600 jin of millet for the country. Our specific plan is: (1) Guarantee that all workers in the team actively report corruption and waste, and do a good job in preventing spies, fire, theft, and special agents. (2) Guarantee that each shift has the full complement of twelve people. Each shift excavates 3.3 meters, and the whole year excavates 3,600 meters. Install a support every meter of advance. (3) The coal face is 3.1 meters high, 2.8 meters wide at the top, and 3.5 meters wide at the bottom. Excavating one meter produces 21 carts of coal, with each cart weighing 0.7 tons; the average coal production efficiency is 5.8 carts. (4) Guarantee to increase each cart by 10%, increasing production by 5,292 tons of coal throughout the year, worth 140,570 jin of millet. (5) Guarantee to eliminate deaths and serious injury accidents throughout the year, and strive to reduce minor injury accidents. (6) Use old materials every month, saving explosives, detonators, and tools such as picks and shovels, which can save 44,116 jin of millet throughout the year. (7) Guarantee to strictly implement the collective shift handover system, not to be absent from work without reason; guarantee to abide by the leave system and strengthen team unity. (8) Actively respond to all national calls, guarantee to take the lead, and guarantee that more than 90% of the team's workers participate in spare-time schools. (9) Hold regular team meetings twice a month to check and summarize the implementation of the plan.

    国营城子、阳泉两煤矿三个小组
    迎接“五一”，向马六孩先进小组应战
    编辑同志：在工人阶级的伟大节日——“五一”劳动节到来时，我们特向马六孩快速掘进小组提出友谊应战。
    今年一月，我们去大同学习了马六孩小组的先进生产方法——多孔道循环作业法。我们回来试验后，已有了初步成绩。三组从过去日进三公尺五到四公尺提高到十四公尺六；十二组也有显著提高。我们做工的地方的情况是不太好的。三组是在一槽作业，每个洞子的顶板和底板都有三十到四十公分的岩石，顶板常塌落，棚子跟不上就有发生事故的危险。我们做工的地方到运输大巷有六百一十公尺远。十二组是在三槽作业，煤层厚度为零点四公尺到二公尺，但时常变化。风巷满是石头，大巷底板有八十公分厚的岩石，淋头水也很大。虽然这样，我们决心战胜这些困难，来实现我们应战的条件。我们并且提出：三组创造日进二十公尺，十二组创造日进十五公尺的新纪录，作为迎接“五一”劳动节向毛主席的献礼。
    我们的应战条件：（一）消灭死亡和重伤，减少轻伤；（二）三组保证日进十八公尺，十二组保证日进十二公尺；（三）每月保证上够二十五个班，遵守各种制度；（四）保证质量，工程规格及运用正规操作方法；（五）爱护工具，节省炮药，不大材小用，三组一个新钻头保证打八百吨煤；（六）坚持每周的技术学习，每周开组务会议，交流经验。
