Qu Yaoli's and Other Mutual Aid Teams Initiate Cotton Production Increase Competition

Xinhua News Agency:
Qu Yaoli, Wu Xuanwen, and Zhang Defang, nationally renowned cotton production models from Shanxi, Jiangxi, and Hebei respectively, along with the mutual aid teams they lead, have issued a joint challenge to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and cotton farmers across the country to compete in increasing cotton yields per unit area. The following is the full text of their challenge:

"Responding to the call of the nation, we will increase cotton production more than last year by increasing cotton yields per unit area to guarantee the needs of the nation's industrial construction. We will make every effort to improve the various systems of the mutual aid team, exert higher labor efficiency, and further increase cotton yields on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. We hope that agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and fellow cotton farmers in cotton-growing areas across the country will compete with us. We welcome everyone to actively respond to the challenge and strive to increase cotton yields. We ask the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the local people's governments to serve as supervisors and judges of this competition. In addition, we also hope to exchange good cotton planting experiences with cotton farmers across the country. Below are our conditions.

    I. The total cotton yield of the group should reach an average of 600 jin (seed cotton) per mu or more, of which at least three mu should have a yield of over 1,000 jin.
    II. To achieve the above goals, we must further improve cotton field cultivation techniques: 1. Select improved varieties and implement close planting; 2. Deep plowing and careful cultivation, hoeing about nine times, timely topping and pruning; 3. Apply large amounts of fertilizer, applying several thousand jin to ten thousand jin of base fertilizer per mu, and apply more top dressing in stages; 4. Strictly prevent and control various insect pests. We also guarantee to disseminate the various cotton techniques we have successfully tested in a timely manner.
    III. After the harvest, we will sell the cotton to the state.
    IV. In addition to cotton fields, we guarantee that other crops will also be planted well, and the yield will not be lower than the local general yield this year.

    曲耀离等互助组发起棉花增产竞赛
    全国著名的棉花丰产模范山西曲耀离、江西吴宣文、河北张德芳和他们各人所领导的互助组，发出联合挑战书，要求全国各地植棉的农业生产合作社、互助组和棉农，和他们作提高棉田单位面积产量的竞赛。下面是他们的挑战书全文：
    “我们响应国家的号召，用提高棉田单位面积产量的办法，增产比去年更多的棉花，来保证国家工业建设的需要。我们要尽一切努力，健全互助组的各种制度，发挥更高的劳动效率，把棉田的产量在去年丰产的基础上再提高一步。我们希望全国各地种棉花的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民弟兄和我们竞赛，欢迎大家踊跃应战，大家为提高棉田的产量奋斗。我们请中央人民政府农业部和当地人民政府作这一竞赛的监督人和评判人。另外，我们还希望和全国棉农交流种棉的好经验。下面是我们的条件。
    一、全组棉田产量达到平均每亩六百斤（籽棉）以上，其中至少应有三亩产量在千斤以上。
    二、为达上述目标，我们要进一步提高棉田耕作技术：1、选用良种，实行密植；2、深耕细作，锄九遍左右，及时摘心打杈；3、大量增施肥料，每亩施基肥几千斤到一万斤，并多施追肥，分期施用；4、严密防治各种虫害。我们并保证把我们试验成功的各种棉技术及时传播出去。
    三、收获后我们就把棉花卖给国家。
    四、除棉田外，我们保证把其他的庄稼也种好，产量不能低于当地今年的一般产量。
