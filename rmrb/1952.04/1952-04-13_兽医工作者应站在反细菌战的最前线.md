Veterinary Workers Should Stand at the Forefront of the Anti-Bacterial Warfare
　　Cheng Shaojiong

　　We have obtained a large amount of conclusive evidence in Northeast China, fully confirming the heinous crime of American military aircraft dropping various insects and objects containing germs and viruses in vast areas of Northeast China. Our scientists have detected Bacillus anthracis from the feathers and houseflies dropped by American aircraft, Pasteurella bacteria from the spiders dropped by American aircraft, Salmonella typhi from the large flies dropped by American aircraft, Salmonella typhi and paratyphi from the dung flies and chironomids dropped by American aircraft, Rickettsia from the black springtails dropped by American aircraft, encephalitis virus from the mosquitoes dropped by American aircraft, and so on.

　　From the insects, feathers, leaves and other poisonous substances dropped by American aircraft, and the fact that these poisonous substances contain germs and viruses, I personally believe that American imperialism has used various methods to spread Bacillus anthracis in an attempt to massively kill the Chinese people. But this heinous attempt by American imperialism is bound to fail.

　　The bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism has not caused an epidemic in China and Korea. On the contrary, it has deepened the hatred of the Chinese and Korean people towards it and strengthened the Chinese people's will to fight back against the American aggressors. I personally witnessed in the Northeast that the people have established a strong epidemic prevention front. This strong people's epidemic prevention front will surely smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism.

　　Scientists in the Northeast have already gained valuable achievements in the struggle against bacteriological warfare. I vow to stand at the forefront of the fight against bacteriological warfare and wage a staunch struggle. At the same time, I hope that our veterinary workers will actively stand at the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare and fight to the end with the people of the whole country to smash the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors!

    兽医工作者应站在反细菌战的最前线
    程绍迥
    我们在东北已获得了大量的确实的证据，充分地证实了美国军用飞机在我国东北广大地区投下大量含有病菌病毒的各种虫子和物体的万恶罪行。我们的科学家已由美国飞机撒下的羽毛和家蝇上查出炭疽杆菌，已由美国飞机撒下的蜘蛛上查出巴氏杆菌，由美国飞机投下的大家蝇查出伤寒杆菌，由美国飞机投下的粪蝇和摇蚊查出伤寒和副伤寒杆菌，由美国飞机投下的黑跳虫查出立克次氏体，由美国飞机投下的蚊虫查出脑炎病毒等等。
    从美国飞机投下的虫子、羽毛、树叶及其他毒物，以及这些毒物含有病菌病毒的事实来看，我个人认为美帝国主义已经利用多种方法撒布炭疽杆菌，企图大规模地杀害中国人民。但是美帝国主义这个万恶企图是一定要失败的。
    美帝国主义发动细菌战，并未在中朝两国引起疫疠流行，相反地却加深了中朝人民对它的仇恨，加强了中国人民反击美国侵略者的斗争意志。我在东北亲眼看见人民群众已经建立了坚强的防疫阵线。这个坚强的人民群众防疫阵线必能粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战。
    东北的科学家们已经在反对细菌战的斗争中，获得了宝贵的成就。我誓愿站在反对细菌战的最前线作坚强的斗争，同时我希望我们兽医工作者都踊跃地站到反细菌战的最前线上去，和全国人民一道为粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争到底！
