Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 14th: Shandong Province's coastal areas have begun constructing large-scale coastal windbreak forest belts. This coastal windbreak forest belt will connect with the coastal windbreak area being built in northern Jiangsu, extending all the way to Chengzikou in Wudi County on the Bohai coast in northern Shandong Province, stretching approximately three thousand *li*.

This coastal windbreak forest belt includes three parallel forest belts that are perpendicular to the wind direction. This year is the first year of constructing this coastal windbreak forest belt. This year's afforestation plan is 100,000 *mu*. The entire forest belt requires afforestation of three million *mu*, and it is expected to be completed by 1956.

After the successful construction of the Shandong Province coastal windbreak forest belt, it can protect the vast farmland along the Shandong coast from the invasion of sea tides and windblown sand. It can also regulate the climate, enabling crops to grow well and ensuring abundant harvests. In the past, the people along the Shandong coast frequently suffered from the disasters of sea tides and windblown sand. In the coastal areas from the Jiahekou to Chengshanjiao in Rongcheng County, over the years, more than 383,000 *mu* of fertile land has gradually turned into mobile sand dunes or deteriorated in soil quality. Since 1949, the local people's governments along the coast have mobilized farmers to plant trees and protect the beaches, and by last year, 160,000 *mu* had been afforested.

Currently, coastal afforestation has begun. In addition to the large-scale supply of seedlings from local state-owned nurseries, the local people's governments along the coast are vigorously mobilizing farmers to implement the principle of "self-collection and self-use" to cultivate seedlings.

    山东省开始营造海滩防风林带
    全部林带长达三千里预计一九五六年可完成
    【新华社济南十四日电】山东省沿海地区已开始大规模地营造海滩防风林带。这道海滩防风林带将和苏北区正在营造的沿海防风林区相接，一直延伸到山东省北部渤海海滨无棣县的埕子口，长达三千华里左右。
    这道海滩防风林带包括和风向成直角的平行的三条林带。今年是营造这道海滩防风林带的第一年。今年的造林计划为十万亩。全部林带需造林三百万亩，预计一九五六年即可完成。
    山东省海滩防风林带建设成功后，可使山东沿海广大农田免除海潮和风沙的侵袭，并可调剂气候，使农作物生长良好，保证丰产。过去山东沿海人民经常遭受海潮和风沙的灾害，从胶河口到荣成县的成山角一带滨海地带，多年来已有三十八万三千多亩良田逐渐变成活动的沙丘或者土质变劣。一九四九年起，沿海各地人民政府就已发动农民造林护滩，到去年为止已造林十六万亩。
    现在，沿海造林已经开始；所需树苗除由各地国营苗圃大量供应外，沿海各地人民政府正大力发动农民贯彻“自采自用”的方针培育树苗。
