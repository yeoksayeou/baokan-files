Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese workers, disregarding the intimidation and divisive tactics of the Yoshida reactionary government, held a nationwide strike and protest movement on the 12th to resolutely oppose the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Act."

According to Kyodo News, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, and the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation first held a 24-hour strike on the morning of the 12th. At the same time, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations and the All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union and other four major unions also held several hours of strike. These striking unions have a total membership of more than 400,000 people. In addition, workers in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places held rallies and demonstrations to support the striking workers and protest against the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." Reuters reported that more than two million workers are expected to participate in the protest movement.

Prior to this, the leaders of the Yoshida government had repeatedly met with union leaders, attempting to use despicable means of coercion and inducement to force the unions to abandon their strike plans. At the same time, they vigorously publicized that the Yoshida government was "considering" revising the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" to ensure that it would "not suppress normal labor movements." However, under the firm opposition of the working masses, the leading body of the movement against the fascist bill—the "Struggle Committee Against Deteriorating Labor Regulations"—issued successive statements on the 9th and 10th. The 9th statement, in addition to announcing that the strike on the 12th would proceed as scheduled, also announced that the second strike would be held on the 18th. The statement said that holding a strike to oppose the fascist bill was to defend the freedom and lives of the people, and that the unions participating in the strike would fight until the Yoshida government withdrew the bill. The 10th statement pointed out that the Yoshida government's attempt to make literal changes to the fascist bill did not change the repressive nature of the bill, and that the bill would still not be accepted.

Some upper-level union members who had hesitated about the strike struggle under the inducement of the Yoshida government also encountered firm opposition from the working masses. For example, coal miners in Hokkaido and Ibaraki Prefecture, disregarding the order of the upper-level members of the Japan Coal Miners' Union to postpone the strike, participated in the strike struggle on the 12th as scheduled.

    坚决反对吉田反动政府的法西斯法案
    日本工人举行全国规模的罢工
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：日本工人群众不顾吉田反动政府的恫吓和分化，在十二日举行了全国规模的罢工和抗议运动，坚决反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”。
    据共同社讯，在十二日晨首先举行二十四小时罢工的有全国金属工会、全日本汽车产业工会和合成化学产业工会联合会；同时，全国产业别工会联合会、全日本电气产业工会等四大工会，也举行了数小时的罢工。这些罢工工会共拥有会员四十万人以上。除此以外，东京、大阪等地的工人，并纷纷举行集会和示威游行，声援罢工工人，抗议所谓“防止破坏活动法案”。据路透社透露，参加抗议运动的工人，预料有二百多万人。
    在此以前，吉田政府的首脑曾多次会见工会领袖，企图利用威逼利诱的卑鄙手段，迫使工会放弃罢工的计划；同时并大事宣传吉田政府“考虑”修改“防止破坏活动法案”，使它“不压制正常的工人运动”。但是，在工人群众的坚决反对下，反对法西斯法案运动的工会领导机构——“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”在九日和十日接连发表声明，九日的声明除了宣布十二日的罢工将如期举行以外，并宣布第二次罢工订于十八日举行。声明说：举行罢工以反对法西斯法案是为了保卫人民的自由和生活；参加罢工的工会将斗争到吉田政府撤回这个法案时为止。十日的声明指出：吉田政府企图将法西斯法案作字面上的更改，这并没有改变该法案的镇压性质，这个法案仍然是不会被接受的。
    在吉田政府的诱迫之下对罢工斗争表示犹豫不前的若干工会上层分子，也遭到工人群众的坚决反对。例如，北海道和茨城县的煤矿工人，不顾日本煤矿工会上层分子的延期罢工的命令，如期在十二日参加了罢工斗争。
