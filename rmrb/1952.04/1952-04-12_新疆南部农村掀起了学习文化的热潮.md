    A surge of enthusiasm for learning culture sweeps through rural southern Xinjiang
    Luo Liyun
    After rent reduction and anti-hegemony, a completely new atmosphere emerged in the rural areas of southern Xinjiang. This is the establishment of winter schools in various villages, and the broad masses of farmers have set off a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture.
    The winter school in Hazilike Village, Shufu County, is divided into male and female classes, with 70 people in the male class and 60 people in the female class. Both classes study the worker-peasant literacy textbook compiled by the Education Department of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government. In addition, there is arithmetic and a weekly class on political common sense.
    Every night, the two rooms across from the village government are crowded with people, and bright kerosene lamps hang on the walls. On the evening of February 1, the teacher of Group A of the male class, shoemaker Atuhan, said to poor peasant Sawt Maimait, who was standing in front of the blackboard:
    "A farmer went to the bazaar with 11,500 yuan, bought 9,900 yuan worth of salt and kindling, how much is left?"
    Sawt Maimait picked up a piece of chalk and started calculating on the blackboard. He wrote and erased, erased and wrote, and finally came up with the number: 1,600 yuan.
    "Is the number Sawt Maimait came up with correct?" After Atuhan asked everyone this, he called up an old farmer and a young farmer. They were calculating very carefully on the blackboard. Other farmers were in their seats, pointing to the blackboard and discussing in a low voice: "This time it's wrong, five times six should be thirty, how could it be thirty-five?..." The farmers of Hazilike Village spent every night of the whole winter in the winter school like this after rent reduction and anti-hegemony. Every night when school was over, although it was very late, many farmers were still reluctant to go home and were still hunched over their desks writing or doing arithmetic exercises. Women, after drinking tea and eating nang every morning, would take their literacy textbooks and exercise books and walk to the village office in groups, chatting and laughing.
    The farmers' enthusiasm for learning is beyond our imagination. During the day, as long as we went to the village, we could see farmers everywhere in the courtyard, on the earthen platform at the door, or in the sun, reviewing their literacy textbooks. Old farmers were reciting: "Manshamu and Hanshamu planted fruits, Simayi Yunuosi and You'erlaixi helped each other, Kadier and Kasimu repaired the canal, and planted a lot of millet and sorghum..." Young peasant women were writing on small notebooks made of white newspaper: "Pot, father, mother, plate, grain, wheat straw on the roof..." Not only did the students learn enthusiastically, but the teachers also taught with the same enthusiasm. Awali is the teacher of Group B of the women's class. Her husband is the township head and is working in another township as part of the rent reduction work team. She takes care of two children alone and is now more than eight months pregnant. Whether it snows or the wind blows, she goes to the winter school to lecture every day, never missing a day.
    After two months of study, they have generally learned the alphabet and some single words. For example, Yusufu Ahemaiti, who is forty years old, had studied scriptures in a scripture school for two years and could not even write his own name. He did not even know how many letters there were in the Uyghur language. He attended winter school for three months in 1950, and then for another two months after rent reduction and anti-hegemony. Now he can understand the entire worker-peasant literacy textbook. He can slowly read simple news in the newspaper. He feels that the winter school has helped him a lot, so after rent reduction and anti-hegemony last autumn, he sent his son Abudukadier, who was studying scriptures in a scripture school, to the winter school. Abudukadier is studying in Group C of the men's class and is one of the best students in the group. He can fluently read and write the lessons he has learned, and understand their meaning. Another example is Patanmu Simayi Khan, the wife of the deputy director of the township farmers' association, who was illiterate in the past. She attended winter school for three months in 1950, and then for another two months after rent reduction and anti-hegemony. She can now read up to Lesson 15 of the literacy textbook. She is very attentive and practices writing characters on kindling boards when she has nothing to do. If she doesn't understand something, she asks her husband. In terms of political common sense, such as when the People's Republic of China was founded, who is the chairman, where does he live, how many people are there in China, how many autonomous regions are there in China, who is the commander-in-chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who is the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, what is the difference between the People's Government and the Kuomintang reactionary government, why should we love the country, and what is the anti-US and aid Korea campaign, more than half of the students in the winter school can answer these questions correctly.
    Although winter schools were also held in rural areas in southern Xinjiang in 1950, the number of people participating in winter schools was not large, and most of them could not persevere to the end. Many people studied for two days and stopped for one day, so the results were not great. After rent reduction and anti-hegemony, it was completely different. Not only did the number of people participating in winter school greatly increase, but they could all persevere to the end. The number of people attending winter school in Hazilike Village accounts for about 40% of the number of people who can attend winter school. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters are all classmates. Some even share a bench, while others study in the same group. The current winter school was originally scheduled for three months, but now the students unanimously requested to extend it until before ploughing. After ploughing, the winter school will end, and each production mutual aid group will place a small blackboard, take it to the field, hang it on the treetop, so that they can learn while producing. The farmers said: "After rent reduction and anti-hegemony, our lives have been improved. After land reform, we all have land, and we will no longer worry about food and clothing. Life is getting better day by day. In the future, we will use machines to cultivate the land. How can we use machines if we don't learn culture?"
    Farmers are so enthusiastic about learning culture, not only in Hazilike Village. Other areas after rent reduction and anti-hegemony are also like this. The sales of stationery and paper in the Aksu Xinhua Bookstore fully illustrate this point. Before rent reduction and anti-hegemony, the Aksu Xinhua Bookstore only sold more than 300,000 yuan of stationery and paper a day; after rent reduction and anti-hegemony, it could sell more than 3 million yuan a day. Sales increased tenfold. In December 1951 alone, stationery and paper sold for more than 70 million yuan. As soon as the literacy textbooks arrived, the bookstore entrance was crowded with people, and they were sold out in a short time. When farmers come to the city, they always go to the bookstore to see if there are any books to buy, or ask if the literacy textbooks have arrived. Many vendors have changed their professions and are selling stationery and paper in small baskets. As long as they go around the market a few times, their baskets are empty. At every market in the rural areas, when farmers go home, they always buy half a sheet of white newspaper and a pencil to take back. This kind of atmosphere has never existed before.
    The current problem is a serious lack of reading materials for farmers. The Uyghur version of "Xinjiang Propagandist" was originally intended for farmers to read, but farmers still feel it is too difficult and cannot understand it at all, so sales are not good. Some popular readings we publish, such as picture books, are all in Chinese. Except for literacy textbooks, there are no other books for farmers to read. At the same time, the only type of reading material for farmers - literacy textbooks - is issued in too few copies. On average, two or three people attending winter school can buy one copy.
    Eliminating illiteracy in the Uyghur area is much easier than eliminating illiteracy in the Han area, because the structure and grammar of the Uyghur language are simpler and easier to learn than Chinese. As long as we can persevere to the end and hold winter schools continuously for three or four times, farmers can generally read popular books and newspapers, which is entirely possible. Based on the current enthusiasm for learning among farmers, it is estimated that a higher wave of enthusiasm for learning will be set off after land reform. Therefore, from now on, the cultural education and translation departments must start preparing, and compile and translate a large number of popular readings to supply the farmers with spiritual food. Comrades engaged in cultural, educational and translation work, let us greet this work with the greatest enthusiasm!

    新疆南部农村掀起了学习文化的热潮
    罗立韵
    经过减租反霸后的新疆南部农村，出现了一种完全崭新的气象，这就是各村都成立了冬学，广大的农民群众已掀起了学习文化的热潮。
    疏附县哈孜力克村的冬学分男女两班，男子班七十人，女子班六十人，男女两班都学习新疆省人民政府教育厅编的工农识字课本，此外还有算术，每星期还上一次政治常识课。
    每天晚上，村政府对面的两间里外屋，都挤满了人，墙上挂着明亮的石油灯。二月一日这天晚上，男子班甲组的教员阿脱汗靴子匠，对站在黑板跟前的贫农沙吾提买买提说：
    “一个农民带着一万一千五百元人民币上巴札，买了九千九百元的盐和引火板，还剩多少？”
    沙吾提买买提拿起粉笔，在黑板上计算起来，他写了又擦掉，擦掉了又写，最后得出的数字是：还剩一千六百元。
    “沙吾提买买提得出的数字对不对？”阿脱汗这样问了大家之后，又叫起了一个年老的农民和一个年青的农民，他们很用心地在黑板上计算着，其他的农民在自己的座位上，指着黑板低低地议论：“这次可算错了，五乘六应该是三十，怎么会是三十五呢？……”哈孜力克村的农民们，减租反霸后整个冬天的每一个晚上，都是这样地在冬学里度过的。每晚散学时，虽天色已很晚了，但不少农民还不愿意回家，仍伏在桌子上写字或做算术习题。妇女们则每早在喝茶吃馕之后，带着识字课本和练习簿，三五成群说说笑笑地走向村公所。
    农民们的学习情绪之高，是我们想像不到的。白天，只要我们到村子里去走一趟，到处都可以看见农民们在院子里，在门口的土台上，或在太阳地里温习识字课本。年老的农民在念着“曼沙木和汗沙木种了果子，司马益玉奴思和尤而来喜互助劳动，卡地尔和卡司木修了渠，种了许多的糜子和高粱……”年青的农妇在白报纸的小本上写着：“大锅、父亲、母亲、盘子、粮食、麦草在房上……”不仅学生热情地学，教员也同样热情地教。阿瓦艾利是女子班乙组的教员，她的丈夫是乡长，已参加减租工作队在外乡工作，她一人带着两个孩子，现又怀孕八个多月，不论下雪或刮风，她天天都去冬学讲课，从未间断过一天。
    经过两个来月的学习，一般地都学会了字母，还学会了一些单字。例如四十岁的玉苏甫阿合买提，过去在经文学校念过两年经，连自己的名字都不会写，维文一共有多少字母也不知道，一九五零年上了三个月冬学，减租反霸后又上了两个月冬学，现在工农识字课本已能全部看懂了，报纸上简单的消息慢慢地也能读下去了，他感到冬学对他的帮助很大，所以在去秋减租反霸后，他把正在经文学校念经的儿子阿不都卡地尔也送到冬学去了。阿不都卡地尔在男子班丙组学习，是组上学得最好的一个，学过的功课都能流利地读出和写出，并了解其中的意思。又如乡农会副主任的妻帕坦木司马益汗，过去一字不识，一九五零年上了三个月冬学，减租反霸后又上了两个月冬学，识字课本已能念到十五课。她很用心，没事的时候就在引火板上练习字，不懂得的地方就问丈夫。在政治常识方面，如中华人民共和国是那一年成立的，主席是谁，住在那里，中国有多少人口，中国有几个自治区，中国人民解放军的总司令是谁，新疆省人民政府的主席是谁，人民政府和国民党反动政府有什么不同，为什么要爱护国家，抗美援朝是怎么回事等问题，冬学一半以上的学生都能正确地回答出来。
    一九五零年南疆各地农村虽也办过冬学，但参加冬学的人数不多，且大部分不能坚持到底，不少人学两天停一天，所以收效不大。减租反霸后就完全不同了，不仅参加冬学的人数大大增加，同时都能坚持到底。哈孜力克村上冬学的人数占可以上冬学的人数的百分之四十左右，父亲和儿子，母亲和女儿，婆婆和媳妇，丈夫和妻子，兄弟和姊妹都是同学，有的还共坐一条板凳，有的则同在一组学习。这一期冬学原定三个月，现在学生们一致要求延长到开犁之前，开犁后冬学结束，每个生产互助小组置一块小黑板，带到地里，挂在树梢上，一面生产，一面还可以学习。农民们说：“经过减租反霸，我们的生活得到了改善，土地改革后，我们都有了地，再不会为吃穿发愁了，日子一天比一天好，往后还要用机器种地，不学习文化怎么能使用机器呢？”
    农民如此热心地学习文化，不只是哈孜力克一村，经过减租反霸后的其他地区也都是这样的，阿克苏新华书店文具纸张的销路，就充分地说明了这点。减租反霸前，阿克苏新华书店的文具纸张一天只卖三十多万元；减租反霸后一天能卖三百多万元，销售量增加了十倍，一九五一年十二月份一个月，文具纸张就卖了七千余万元人民币。只要识字课本一到，书店门口就站满了人，一会儿就卖完了。农民进城来，总要到书店去看看有没有可买的书，或者问问识字课本到了没有。不少小贩转了业，提个小篮子贩卖文具纸张，只要在集市上转上几圈，篮子就空了。各地农村中的每一次集市，赶集市的农民们回家时，总要买半张白报纸和一支铅笔带回去。这种气象过去是不曾有过的。
    目前的问题是严重地缺乏农民读物。维文版的
    “新疆宣传员”，原来是准备给农民阅读的，但农民仍感到太深，根本看不懂，所以销路不好。我们所出版的一些通俗读物，如小人书等，又都是汉文的，除识字课本外，再无其他书籍可使农民阅读了。同时，仅有的一种农民读物——识字课本，发行的份数又太少，上冬学的平均二、三个人才能买到一本。
    在维吾尔族地区消灭文盲比在汉族地区消灭文盲要容易得多，因为维语的构造和文法都比汉语简单易学，只要能坚持到底，连续办三、四次冬学，农民就可普遍地阅读通俗的书籍和报纸，这是完全可以办到的。根据农民现在的学习情绪，估计在土地改革后一定会掀起一个更高的学习热潮。所以从现在起，文化教育和编译部门要开始做准备工作，大量编写和翻译通俗读物，以供给农民精神上的食粮。从事文教编译工作的同志们，我们用最大的热情来迎接这个工作吧！
