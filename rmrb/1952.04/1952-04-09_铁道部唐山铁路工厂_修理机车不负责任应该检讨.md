    Tangshan Railway Factory of the Ministry of Railways
    Should Review its Irresponsible Repair of Locomotives

    To the Editor: The Tangshan Railway Factory, directly under the Ministry of Railways, has always been careless and irresponsible in repairing locomotives. In the first quarter of this year, the factory repaired and delivered a total of 21 locomotives, of which 7 were deemed unusable by various railway bureau locomotive sections; and 2 locomotives experienced accidents and were stranded during the return trip after leaving the factory. However, the factory and the Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have not paid attention to these problems and have not taken timely responsibility for resolving them.

    Recently, a locomotive repaired by the factory left the factory on March 8. When it was being returned to Tianjin, the crew found that the lower part of the right crescent plate was worn, and the rat-tail pin of the left and right radius rods had come out, making it impossible to continue driving. After the factory learned of this, it sent two foremen to inspect, and the investigation report stated: "The damage was caused by a lack of oil." The factory listened only to this one-sided statement and concluded that the lack of oil was not the factory's responsibility, and ignored it. The Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways also held the same attitude and refused to investigate. Only after the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to conduct an inspection together with relevant personnel, did they learn that the pin and sleeve showed no signs of burning, the arc of the crescent plate and the slider did not match, and the pin and sleeve were not surface hardened according to regulations. At this point, the factory sent people to Tianjin for repairs. During the repair, it was also found that the rod hole had cracks and had to be returned to the factory for repair. This locomotive was stranded for seven days, resulting in a total loss of more than 20 million yuan, as well as wasted man-hours and rework costs for the receiving personnel.

    The Tangshan Railway Factory and the Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways shirked their responsibilities, demonstrating serious bureaucracy. I think they should thoroughly examine their mistakes and make a public self-criticism.　A Reader

### 铁道部唐山铁路工厂  修理机车不负责任应该检讨

    铁道部唐山铁路工厂
    修理机车不负责任应该检讨
    编辑同志：中央铁道部直属唐山铁路工厂修理机车，一向马虎不负责任。今年第一季度，该厂修理出厂的机车共二十一台，其中有七台车各路局机务段认为不能使用；有两台车在出厂回送途中，因事故搁车。但该厂及铁道部厂务局对这些问题并没有加以重视，没有及时负责解决。
    最近该厂修理的一台机车，在三月八日出厂。当回送至天津时，乘务员发现右侧月牙钣下部被磨伤，左右半径杆鼠尾销窜出，不能继续行驶。该厂知悉后，即派领工员二人去检查，查明报告：“系缺油造成烧损。”该厂偏听此一面之词，就认为缺油事故不是工厂的责任，置之不理。铁道部厂务局也抱同样态度，拒绝检查。经铁道部机务总局派员会同有关人员检查，才知销及套毫无烧坏迹象，月牙钣与滑块弧度不符合，销、套未按规章施行表面硬化。至此，该厂才派人去天津修理。修理时又发现杆孔有裂缝，必须返厂修理。这台机车被搁滞了七天，共损失二千多万元，还浪费了接车人员的工时费及返工工料费等。
    唐山铁路工厂和铁道部厂务局推卸责任，表现了严重的官僚主义。我认为他们应彻底检查错误，并作公开检讨。　一读者
