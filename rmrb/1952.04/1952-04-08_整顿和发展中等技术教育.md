    Rectifying and Developing Secondary Technical Education

    The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's directive on rectifying and developing secondary technical education has been published today. This is an important measure in the construction of new China's cultural and educational undertakings, a concrete step in implementing the Common Program's "emphasis on technical education," and also a major event related to China's economic construction. This directive is not only completely suited to China's current reality and needs, but also has significant implications for China's planned national-scale construction in the future.

    China has already moved ahead of capitalist countries politically, and China's political system has incomparable advantages over that of capitalist countries. The leadership of the working class and the system of people's democratic dictatorship ensure that China will move towards industrialization step by step, the national economy will become more prosperous day by day, the material and cultural lives of the people will gradually improve, productivity will continue to increase, and technology and science will develop rapidly. In the economic sphere we will certainly catch up with and surpass capitalist countries. Our country now stands like a giant in the world, and we can no longer tolerate being in a backward position economically. But to get rid of this economic backwardness, the central key lies in developing industry. "Only when China's industry is developed and China is no longer economically dependent on foreign countries will it have complete and genuine independence." (Chairman Mao: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship")

    To develop industry, we need technology and technical personnel. Chairman Mao instructed us: Cultivating technical personnel is a fundamental plan for our country. Therefore, cultivating technical personnel is one of the major political tasks of our country today. At the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Premier Guo Moruo pointed out in his report on cultural and educational work that 500,000 intermediate and junior technical cadres should be trained in five to six years, and we must strive to achieve this goal.

    At present, there are more than 700 secondary technical schools (including specialized schools) with approximately 150,000 students nationwide. These schools can be roughly divided into two types: one is the original schools before liberation (a considerable number of which are private); the other is the newly established schools after liberation or the original schools that have been completely transformed. The former type of school has made some improvements since liberation, but the goals and tasks are still not clear enough, and there is serious blindness; technical courses are very complicated, covering everything, resulting in learning nothing well; or there are too few subjects, almost the same as ordinary middle schools; the teaching content is generally divorced from reality; and the experimental equipment is very poor. Therefore, this type of school must be further transformed to meet the actual needs of national construction. The latter type of school is mostly run by relevant business departments, and is generally said to meet actual needs, but the subjects are often complicated, and the proportions and teaching content of each subject lack unified and correct standards. Therefore, the policy of rectifying and developing secondary technical education stipulated in the directive of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council is completely in line with the current situation and needs.

    Rectifying and developing secondary technical education should start with rectifying existing secondary technical schools. Because rectifying existing schools and putting them on the right track will lay a solid foundation for the broad development of secondary technical education in the future. To this end, the education departments of governments at all levels, the responsible cadres of relevant business departments at all levels, and all types and levels of secondary technical schools must have a comprehensive understanding and analysis of the goals, tasks, departments, and courses (political courses, general courses, technical courses, and experimental internships), teaching content, time proportions, teaching methods, teaching equipment, school organizations and systems, personnel allocation, and the situation of teachers and students; and, in accordance with construction needs, decide which should be retained, consolidated, and improved, and which should be transformed or abolished.

    We should make necessary and appropriate adjustments based on the needs of national construction and the current situation of secondary technical schools. This adjustment work must be carried out after thorough and careful consideration, full consultation and preparation, and approval from higher authorities. We must avoid acting rashly from a one-sided perspective. We should recognize that the purpose of the adjustment is to make secondary technical schools more closely adapt to the needs of construction, to make the goal of schools to train talents clearer, to make the use of human and financial resources more rational, and to make the development of secondary technical education more planned.

    China's secondary technical education must be vigorously developed. The country needs various intermediate technical talents urgently, and the current number of technical schools and students is far from meeting objective requirements; in order to meet the needs of national construction, it is necessary to increase the number of schools and train a large number of people; and attention should be paid to accelerated training. In addition to regular technical schools, short-term and part-time technical training classes and cram schools must also be established in order to quickly supply the country's needs for technical cadres. However, judging from China's current financial situation, teachers, student sources, school buildings, equipment, and teaching materials, we will still encounter many difficulties in developing secondary technical education. We should overcome these difficulties according to the policy pointed out by Vice Premier Guo Moruo in his report on cultural and educational work at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year; we should develop in a pragmatic and planned way, rather than blindly.

    Cultivating technical talents from industrial workers and revolutionary cadres is the key to the entire training of technical cadres, and all localities must pay special attention to it. The great "Three-Anti" movement taught us how serious the transformation work must be for old technical personnel, and also taught us how serious and urgent the task of cultivating the most reliable technical talents from the working class is. Only when the working class has its own technical talents as the strong backbone of the construction team can our country's industrialization be reliably guaranteed. Therefore, all departments should make the greatest determination, starting from a comprehensive and long-term perspective, and select a group of outstanding Communist Party members and industrial workers to send to appropriate secondary technical schools for study on the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks.

    To correctly rectify and develop secondary technical education, we must first strengthen and unify the leadership of secondary technical schools. Education departments and business departments at all levels must have a correct understanding and appropriate handling of the following relationship issues.

    (1) The relationship between education departments and business departments. Secondary technical education is part of the country's entire education cause, so the education departments must manage it. It is also directly related to the issue of various relevant business departments cultivating technical cadres, so the relevant business departments must also manage it. In order to ensure that everyone manages it and that the management is correct organizationally, the Government Administration Council clearly stipulates in its instructions that education departments and business departments should divide responsibilities and lead under unified policies and plans, and organize secondary technical education committees at all levels. It is wrong and should be prevented or corrected to do things like "if you manage it, I won't manage it, and if I manage it, you don't manage it," or to adopt a passive attitude towards leadership.

    (2) The relationship between the central government and the greater administrative areas, provinces (cities). When adjusting the leadership relationship of existing secondary technical schools, the central business departments must consider the needs of various regions to train local construction cadres; the greater administrative areas and provinces (cities) must also consider the needs of the central business departments to train technical talents. It is necessary to oppose and correct all tendencies towards localism that only take care of the local and ignore the overall situation, lacking a comprehensive perspective.

    (3) The relationship between public and private schools. Education departments and relevant business departments at all levels should actively rectify and develop public schools, and should also strengthen leadership, transform, and rectify private technical schools. They should not adopt an attitude of indifference or fail to actively lead and help transform.

    (4) The relationship between schools and industrial, mining, agricultural, and enterprise units. In order to combine theory with practice and meet the needs of construction, relevant business departments and education departments must help affiliated schools establish connections with nearby relevant industrial, mining, agricultural, and enterprise units. In the future, newly established schools should also be attached to or near relevant enterprise units as much as possible, and the school's experimental practice and technical course teaching should obtain the assistance of the responsible persons and engineers and technicians of nearby relevant enterprise units.

    At present, there are still many difficulties in developing secondary technical education, but our difficulties are all difficulties in development, and therefore they can all be overcome. Now, the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has promulgated instructions on rectifying and developing secondary technical education, which gives us powerful weapons to overcome these difficulties and successfully complete the major task of training a large number of intermediate and junior technical cadres.

    整顿和发展中等技术教育
    中央人民政府政务院关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示今天公布了。这是新中国文化教育建设事业上的一个重要措施，是实施共同纲领“注重技术教育”的一个具体步骤，也是有关我国经济建设的一项大事件。这个指示不仅完全适合目前我国的现实情况和需要，并且对我国今后有计划地进行全国规模的建设有着重大的意义。
    我国在政治上已经走在资本主义国家的前头，我国的政治制度比起资本主义国家的政治制度来有不可比拟的优越性。我国工人阶级的领导和人民民主专政的制度，保证我国一步一步地向工业化迈进，国民经济一天比一天繁荣，人民大众的物质和文化的生活逐渐上升，生产力不断提高，技术和科学日益发展，在经济上也必然会赶上和超过资本主义国家。现在我们的国家像一个巨人一样屹立于世界，再不能容忍在经济上继续处于落后的地位。但要摆脱出这种经济上的落后地位，中心关键就在于发展工业。“只有中国的工业发展了，中国在经济上不倚赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。”（毛主席：“论人民民主专政”）
    要发展工业就需要技术，需要掌握技术的人才。毛主席指示我们：培养技术人才，是我们国家根本之图。因此培养技术人才，乃是我们的国家当前的重大政治任务之一。在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上，郭沫若副总理在文化教育工作的报告中，指出在五六年内要培养五十万中级和初级技术干部，我们必须为实现这一目标而努力。
    现在全国共有中等技术学校（包括专业学校）七百余所，学生约十五万人。这些学校大体上可分为两种类型：一类是解放前原有的学校（其中有相当数量是私立的）；一类是解放后新建立的学校或原有学校已加以彻底改造的。前一类学校，解放以来虽已作了一些改进，但目标任务仍不够明确，有严重的盲目性；技术课非常繁杂，样样都有，结果是样样都学不好；或科目太少，几与普通中学无异；教学内容一般地脱离实际；实习实验的设备很差。因此这类学校必须进一步改造，才能切合国家建设的实际需要。后一类学校，多半是由有关业务部门举办的，一般说是适合实际需要的，但也往往科目庞杂，各科时数比重和教学内容缺乏统一和正确的标准。因此中央人民政府政务院的指示中所规定的整顿与发展中等技术教育的方针，是完全符合当前的情况和需要的。
    整顿与发展中等技术教育，首先要从整顿现有中等技术学校开始。因为把现有学校整顿好，纳入正轨，就能为今后中等技术教育的广阔发展奠定下巩固的基础。为此，各级人民政府教育部门、各级有关业务部门及各类各级中等技术学校的负责干部，必须对现有学校的目标、任务、科别以及课程（政治课、普通课、技术课与实验实习）、教学内容、时数比重、教学方法、教学设备、学校组织和制度、人事配备、师资和学生情况等方面作一番全面的了解和分析研究；并按照建设需要，决定那些应该保留巩固与提高，那些应该改造或废弃。
    我们应该根据国家建设的需要和现有中等技术学校的现状，作必要和适当的调整。这种调整工作必须经过通盘周密的考虑，充分的协商和准备，以及上级的批准，切忌从片面出发，草率从事。我们应该认识调整的目的是为了使中等技术学校更加密切地适应建设的需要，使学校培养人才的目标更加明确，使人力财力的使用更合理化，使中等技术教育的发展更具计划性。
    我国中等技术教育必须大力发展。国家需要各种中等技术人才十分迫切，而现有的技术学校和学生数目和客观要求相距很远；为了适应国家建设需要，必须增办学校，大量培养；而且注重速成，除正规技术学校以外，并须创办短期的以及业余的技术训练班和补习班，以求能迅速供应国家对技术干部的需要。但从目前我国财政情况、师资、学生来源、校舍、设备及教材等条件来看，我们在发展中等技术教育中，还将遇到许多困难，对于这些困难，我们应该根据郭沫若副总理在去年政治协商会议全国委员会第三次会议上的文化教育工作报告中所指示的方针去克服；我们应该实事求是地有计划地去发展，而不是盲目的发展。
    从产业工人与革命干部中培养技术人才，是整个培养技术干部的关键，各地必须特别重视。伟大的“三反”运动教训了我们，对于旧的技术人员必须进行何等严重的改造工作，也教训了我们，从工人阶级中培养最可靠的技术人才，是何等严重和迫切的任务。只有工人阶级有了自己的技术人才作为建设队伍的坚强骨干，我们国家的工业化才有可靠的保证。因此各个部门应该下最大的决心，在保证完成生产任务的条件下，从全面的长远的观点出发，有计划地从优秀的共产党员和产业工人中选调出一批人来送入适当的中等技术学校学习。
    要正确地整顿和发展中等技术教育，首先必须加强和统一对中等技术学校的领导。各级人民政府教育部门及业务部门对于下列几个方面的关系问题必须有正确了解和适当处理。
    （一）教育部门与业务部门的关系问题。中等技术教育是国家整个教育事业的一部分，因此教育部门必须管。它又是直接关涉各有关业务部门培养技术干部的问题，所以各有关业务部门也必须管。为了大家都管，而且从组织上保证管得正确，所以政务院指示中明确规定教育部门与业务部门在统一方针政策计划下分工负责领导，并组织各级中等技术教育委员会。一切“你管我就不管，我管你就不要管”，或对领导抱消极被动的态度都是不对的，都应该防止或纠正。
    （二）中央和大行政区、省（市）的关系问题。在调整现有中等技术学校领导关系时，中央各业务部门必须考虑各地区培养地方建设干部的需要；大行政区、省（市）也必须考虑中央各业务部门培养技术人才的需要。一切只顾局部、不管全局、缺乏全面观点的本位主义作风都是应该反对与纠正的。
    （三）公立与私立学校的关系问题。各级教育部门及有关业务部门对公立学校固应积极整顿和发展，对私立技术学校亦应该加强领导、改造和整顿，不应该采取漠不关心，或不去积极领导与帮助改造的态度。
    （四）学校与工矿农场企业单位的关系问题。为结合实际，切合建设需要，各有关业务部门与教育部门必须帮助所属学校与附近有关的工矿农场企业单位建立联系。今后新设学校亦应尽量附设于或靠近有关的企业单位，学校的实验实习和技术课的教学、应取得附近有关企业单位的负责人与工程师、技师等的帮助。
    目前发展中等技术教育工作，还存在着许多困难，但我们的困难都是发展中的困难，因而也都是可以克服的。现在中央人民政府政务院公布的关于整顿与发展中等技术教育的指示就给我们以有力的武器，去克服这些困难，胜利地完成大量培养中初级技术干部的重大任务。
