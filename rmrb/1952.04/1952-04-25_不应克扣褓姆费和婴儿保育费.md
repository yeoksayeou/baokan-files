    Nanny Fees and Infant Care Fees Should Not Be Deducted

    Editor: The infant care fees stipulated by the state are for nurturing the descendants of the revolution. However, some female cadres in government organs arbitrarily deduct and misuse their children's nanny fees or other childcare fees. In Anyang City, Pingyuan Province, many female cadres in government organs (even those working in women's affairs) do not pay nannies the fees they deserve. A nanny who should receive 140 catties of millet per month only receives 100 catties. Some female cadres deduct nanny fees and childcare fees for their children to equip themselves or for extravagant eating and drinking. More seriously, some female cadres even use the deducted money for exploitation. For example, So Yaoqin, vice chairman of the Anyang City Democratic Women's Federation, uses this deducted money to lend at high interest rates in several places and invests in production in the government organ. Therefore, a saying circulates in the government organs (supply system departments): "Women get rich as soon as they have children." This not only creates a bad influence among the masses and harms the health of infants, but also encourages these female comrades' frivolous ideas and behaviors.

    I suggest that relevant departments pay attention to correcting this phenomenon.

### 不应克扣褓姆费和婴儿保育费

    不应克扣褓姆费和婴儿保育费
    编辑同志：国家规定的婴儿保育费，是为保育革命后代用的。有些机关妇女干部却随便克扣乱用自己小孩的褓姆费或其他保育费。在平原省安阳市，有好多机关的女干部（甚至做妇女工作的人也在内），不按褓姆应得的费用发给褓姆。每月该发一百四十斤小米的，只给一百斤。有的女干部克扣褓姆费和小孩的保育费，来装备自己，或者大吃大喝。更严重的是，有的女干部竟把所克扣的钱拿去进行剥削。如安阳市民主妇女联合会副主席索耀琴，就用这种克扣的钱在好几处放高利贷，又在机关生产中入股金。因此，在机关中（供给制部门）流传着一句说：“妇女一生小孩就发财了。”这样不只在群众中造成不良影响，使婴儿的健康受到损失，而且助长了这些女同志们的浮华思想和行为。
    我建议有关部门注意纠正这种现象。
