Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai press circles issued a statement on March 28, protesting the British government in Hong Kong's unreasonable "summons" of staff members of the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Wen Hui Pao, and New Evening Post, conspiring to destroy the Chinese people's news media in Hong Kong. The statement said: We absolutely cannot tolerate this serious crime of British imperialism plotting to destroy the Chinese people's news media in Hong Kong. The British government in Hong Kong has consistently oppressed Chinese residents and has consistently been hostile to the Chinese people's news media; today, this new conspiracy and atrocity fully demonstrates its intention to be an enemy of the Chinese people, brazenly and shamelessly provoking the great Chinese people. We, the newspapers of Shanghai and the news workers of Shanghai, express great indignation at this conspiracy and atrocity by the British government in Hong Kong, and lodge a solemn protest. We warn the British government in Hong Kong: Your continuous provocations against the Chinese people will inevitably lead to your own destruction. The statement was signed by organizations including Liberation Daily, Xinwen Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Hui Pao, Xinmin Evening News, Labor Daily, Youth Daily, and Shanghai News (English).

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: News workers in Central-South and Wuhan sent letters of condolence to the ten news workers who were unreasonably persecuted by the British government in Hong Kong. The letters said: When the news came that you were subjected to illegal "summons" and "trials" by the British government in Hong Kong, it aroused great indignation among all news workers in Central-South and Wuhan. It is completely reasonable for you to publish reports in Hong Kong that truthfully reflect the protests of the people of the motherland against the reactionary crimes of the British government in Hong Kong in slaughtering the Chinese people. The fact that the British government in Hong Kong dares not announce the solemn protests of the Chinese people to the people shows the ugly face of the imperialists and fully demonstrates the unreasonableness and tyranny of the British government in Hong Kong. In addition to expressing our cordial condolences to your just struggle, we are determined to support you with practical actions such as doing a good job in news dissemination and further exposing all the sinister conspiracies of the imperialists. The letters were signed by all colleagues of the Yangtze River Daily, Central-South Worker's Daily, New Wuhan Daily, Hubei Daily, New Youth Daily, and Hubei Peasant Daily.

    抗议香港英政府暴行
    中南、武汉新闻界函慰香港被迫害的我国新闻工作者
   【新华社讯】上海新闻界在三月二十八日发表声明，抗议香港英国政府无理“传讯”香港大公报、文汇报和新晚报的工作人员，阴谋摧残中国人民在香港的新闻事业。声明中说：我们对英帝国主义阴谋摧残中国人民在香港的新闻事业的这种严重罪行，是绝对不能容忍的。香港英国政府一贯地压迫中国居民，一贯地敌视中国人民的新闻事业；今天这一新的阴谋暴行，更充分表现其居心与中国人民为敌，蛮横无耻地向伟大的中国人民挑衅。我们上海各报和上海的新闻工作人员，对于香港英国政府这一阴谋暴行，表示极大的愤怒，并提出严正抗议。我们警告香港英国政府：你们接连向中国人民挑衅，必将自食其果。在声明上署名的有解放日报、新闻日报、大公报、文汇报、新民报、劳动报、青年报和上海新闻（英文）等单位。
    【新华社汉口三日电】中南、武汉新闻工作者向遭受香港英国政府无理迫害的十位新闻工作者发出慰问信，信上说：当你们遭受香港英国政府非法“传讯”及“审判”的消息传来后，引起我们中南、武汉全体新闻工作者莫大愤慨。你们在香港据实发表祖国人民对香港英国政府屠杀中国人民的反动罪行提出抗议的报道，是完全合理的。香港英国政府不敢将中国人民严正的抗议公告给人民知道，这正暴露了帝国主义者的丑恶面孔，充分表明香港英国政府的无理横暴。我们除向你们的正义斗争致以亲切地慰问外，决以做好新闻发布工作，进一步揭露帝国主义者一切罪恶阴谋等实际行动来支援你们。信末署名：长江日报、中南工人日报、新武汉报、湖北日报、新青年报、湖北农民报全体同人。
