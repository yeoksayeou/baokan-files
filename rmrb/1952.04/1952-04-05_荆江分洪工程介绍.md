The Yangtze River is the great artery of our great motherland. It flows from the mountains of southwestern China through the Three Gorges into the Jianghan Plain. Large ships can navigate below Yichang, and shallow-draft ships can reach Chongqing directly. Its middle and lower reaches are the land of fish and rice in our country, and its upper reaches, the Sichuan Basin, are the rich "Land of Abundance." Along its banks are China's famous industrial and commercial centers such as Chongqing, Wanxian, Yichang, Shashi, Wuhan, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and Shanghai. It is the main transportation line for the three major administrative regions of Southwest, Central South, and East China.

The section of the Yangtze River from Zhijiang County in Hubei Province to Chenglingji at the mouth of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province is called the Jingjiang River. On the north bank, from Zaolin岗 in Jiangling County to Mabugui in Jianli County, there is a large embankment called the Jingjiang Embankment, which is 133 kilometers long. This section of the Yangtze River is narrow, with rapid and turbulent currents. The maximum flow near Shashi can reach more than 50,000 cubic meters per second, but the maximum capacity of the river channel is only 41,000 cubic meters per second. The Jingjiang Embankment, which protects the north bank, is on average 12 meters high, with a difference of seven or eight meters between the inner and outer toes of the embankment, making it extremely dangerous when floods rise sharply. If it were to breach, more than ten counties in Hubei Province, including Jiangling, Jianli, and Mianyang, with a population of three million people and eight million mu of farmland, would be in danger of being flooded; moreover, the Yangtze River would be in danger of changing its course, and the Yangtze River route would be completely paralyzed, which would greatly affect the external transportation of the entire southwestern region. Therefore, the people along the river in Hubei call the Jingjiang Embankment the "lifeline embankment." However, this Jingjiang Embankment, which is related to the safety of the lives and property of millions of people, was not seriously reinforced during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits. They only used river management as a pretext to extort the people.

After the Yangtze River exits the Three Gorges, it can divert floodwaters through the Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian outlets, and use Dongting Lake and the large and small rivers and lakes on both sides to store floodwaters and regulate the water volume. However, these outlets have been silted up for many years due to disrepair, and the riverbed has also been silted up year by year due to sediment deposition, so the water level in Shashi often reaches more than 44 meters. In the flood of 1931, more than five million mu of fertile land was flooded on the north bank of the Jingjiang River, and the number of victims reached three million. The people in Mianyang area said: "Shahu Mianyangzhou, nine out of ten years are barren." This fully reflects the deep suffering of the people.

The great new democratic social system has brought happiness to the people. Soon after the liberation of the Yangtze River basin, the People's Government actively mobilized the vast people along the river to reinforce the Jingjiang Embankment for years. While repairing the embankment, it also sent a large number of hydraulic engineering experts and technicians to survey the Jingjiang River and seek solutions to reduce the threat of Jingjiang floods. After a long period of careful research, the State Council of the Central People's Government solemnly decided to reinforce the Jingjiang Embankment and build the great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project to buy time for the fundamental treatment of the Yangtze River.

The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is the second largest water conservancy project built since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, following the Huai River management project. The project design is to open up a large flood diversion area east of the Hudu River at Taipingkou on the south bank of the Jingjiang River, west of the Jingjiang South Embankment, and northwest of the Anxiang River at Ouchikou, so as to divert and store floodwaters when the Jingjiang water level is too high, reduce the Jingjiang water level, and slow down the flow rate, so as to reduce the burden on the Jingjiang Embankment. The designed flood diversion area has an area of 921.34 square kilometers and can store more than 5.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater.

The entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is planned to be divided into the following parts: 1. Reinforcement of the Jingjiang Embankment, which is the focus of this year's project. Since no flood diversion is planned this year, the goal of reinforcement is to ensure that the embankment does not breach. 2. Construction of the enclosure dike in the flood diversion area on the south bank. The enclosure dike starts near Taipingkou, runs along the south bank of the Yangtze River to Ouchikou, turns southwest to the Hudu River, and then runs along the Hudu River to Taipingkou, forming a bag shape; the dike work totals 12 million cubic meters of earthwork. 3. Construction of flood diversion area inlet gates, control gates, flood discharge gates, etc. The inlet gate will be built near Taipingkou, with a gate length of 1,026 meters. When the gate is opened, it can release a maximum of 12,800 cubic meters per second of Jingjiang floodwater into the flood diversion area. This gate is more than twice as large as the Runheji diversion gate built on the Huai River last year and will be the largest gate in our country. The control gate is near Huangshantou on the Hudu River to control the amount of water flowing from the Hudu River into Dongting Lake to not exceed the flow rate before flood diversion. The flood discharge gate is north of Ouchikou. When the flood diversion area stores floodwater to a certain water level, part of the water is diverted into the lower reaches of the Jingjiang River. 4. Excavation and dredging of ditches and construction of other culverts and gates in the flood diversion area. These projects can accelerate the drying of the land in the flood diversion area to facilitate the planting of winter crops. 5. Planting windbreak and sand fixation forests to protect the banks. 6. Relocation of residents in the flood diversion area, some to safe areas and some to other areas. All of the above projects, except for the flood discharge gate, are scheduled to be completed before the flood season this year.

After the completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, in addition to ensuring the safety of three million people and eight million mu of fertile land in the Jianghan Plain, it can also eliminate the threat of floods in the Dongting Lake area. Now, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Committee and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters, which are leading the construction, have been established under orders. The military workers and civilians from Hubei and Hunan provinces who are participating in the construction have all gone to the embankment. This great flood diversion project, which emphasizes both Hunan and Hubei and benefits both the rivers and lakes, is about to begin. Under the great Chairman Mao's determination and wise leadership, people will strive to complete this huge project before the flood season this year with unparalleled excitement and high labor enthusiasm. The broad masses of the people in Central South warmly support the People's Government's measures to care for the people's livelihood and manage the Jingjiang River, and they will actively support the construction.

    荆江分洪工程介绍
    新华社记者  海波
    长江是我们伟大祖国的大动脉，它从我国西南山地经三峡流入江汉平原。宜昌以下可行大轮船，浅水轮船可直达重庆。它的中游下游地区都是我国的鱼米之乡，它的上游地区四川盆地是富庶的“天府之国”。它的沿岸有我国著名的工商业中心重庆、万县、宜昌、沙市、武汉、九江、芜湖、南京、上海等重要都市。它是我国西南、中南、华东三大行政区的主要交通线。
    从湖北省的枝江县到湖南省洞庭湖口的城陵矶一段长江被人们称为荆江，北岸从江陵县枣林岗到监利县麻布拐有一条长达一百三十三公里的大堤名荆江大堤。这一段长江，江身弯狭，急流汹涌。沙市附近的最高流量可达到五万多秒立方公尺，但是河槽的最高容量只有四万一千秒立方公尺。保护北岸的荆江大堤平均有十二公尺高，内外堤脚相差七、八公尺，洪水猛涨时极为危险。如一旦溃决，湖北省江陵、监利、沔阳等十多县三百万人民、八百万亩农田都有被淹的危险；而且长江还有改道的危险，长江航线将完全陷入瘫痪状态，整个西南地区的对外交通将受极大影响。因此，湖北沿江人民都称荆江大堤为“命堤”。但这个有关千万人民生命财产安危的荆江大堤，在国民党匪帮统治时期没有认真培修过，他们只以治江为名向人民进行敲榨。
    长江出三峡以后，可经松滋、太平、藕池、调弦等口分泄洪水，借洞庭湖和两岸的大小河湖蓄洪来调节水量。但这些口子由于年久失修，多已淤塞，江床也因泥沙沉淀逐年淤高，因而沙市水位常高达四十四公尺以上。一九三一年一次水灾，荆江北岸被淹良田达五百多万亩，灾民达三百万人。沔阳一带人民说：“沙湖沔阳洲，十年九不收。”这充分反映了人民的深重灾难。
    伟大的新民主主义社会制度，给人民带来了幸福。长江流域解放不久，人民政府就积极发动沿江广大人民连年培修荆江大堤，一面修堤，一面就派出了大批水利工程专家和技术人员勘察荆江，寻求减除荆江水患威胁的方案。经过长期的周密研究之后，中央人民政府政务院特郑重决定，加固荆江大堤和兴建伟大的荆江分洪工程，以争取时间从事长江的治本工程。
    荆江分洪工程是伟大的中华人民共和国成立以来紧接治淮工程所兴建的第二巨大水利工程。工程设计是在荆江南岸太平口虎渡河以东，荆江南堤以西，藕池口安乡河西北，开辟一个大量分洪的地区，以便在荆江水位过高时分蓄洪水，减低荆江水位，减缓水势流速，以减轻荆江大堤的负担。设计中的分洪区，面积为九百二十一点三四平方公里，可蓄洪水五十五亿立方公尺以上。
    荆江分洪工程全部计划分以下几大部分：一、荆江大堤加固工程，这是今年工程的重点。由于今年不拟分洪，加固的目标在确保大堤不致溃决。二、修建南岸分洪区围堤，围堤由太平口附近开始，沿长江南岸到藕池口，折向西南到虎渡河，又沿虎渡河到太平口，成一袋形；堤工共计一千二百万土方。三、修建分洪区的进洪闸、节制闸、泄洪闸等。进洪闸将建在太平口附近，闸长一千零二十六公尺，开放闸门最大可放荆江洪水一万二千八百秒立方公尺入分洪区。这个闸比淮河去年修成的润河集分水闸还大两倍以上，将是我国最大的水闸。节制闸在虎渡河上黄山头附近，是控制虎渡河流入洞庭湖的水量不超过分洪前的流量。泄洪闸在藕池口北，分洪区蓄洪到一定水位时，分泄部分水量归入荆江下游。四、开挖和疏通分洪区内的沟渠和修建其他涵闸等工程多处。这些工程可加速涸出分洪区土地以便播种冬季作物。五、造保护堤岸的防浪林。六、分洪区内的移民，一部分移入安全区，一部分移到其他地区。以上全部工程除泄洪闸外，都决定在今年汛前完成。
    荆江分洪工程修成后，除了能保障江汉平原三百万人民、八百万亩良田的安全外，并可免除洞庭湖滨湖地区的水患威胁。现在，领导施工的荆江分洪工程委员会和荆江分洪工程总指挥部已经奉命成立，参加修筑的军工和湖北、湖南两省的民工都已上堤，这一湘鄂并重、江湖两利的伟大的分洪工程即将动工了。在伟大的毛主席的决心和英明领导下，人们将以无比的兴奋，和高度的劳动热情，争取在今年汛期以前完成这一巨大的工程。中南广大人民热烈拥护人民政府这一关心民瘼，治理荆江的措施，他们将积极地支援施工。
