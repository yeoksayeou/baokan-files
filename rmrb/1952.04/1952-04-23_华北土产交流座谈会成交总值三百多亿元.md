The native products exchange symposium convened by the North China Branch of the China Native Produce Company concluded on the 18th. Since the commencement of trading on the 10th, a total of 364 contracts and four agreements were signed over eight days, with a total transaction value reaching 33.8 billion yuan. This enabled some regions to find outlets for their slow-moving native products and specialties, while also supplying some regions with needed industrial raw materials. Large transactions were made for North China's black dates, red dates, dried black dates, Chinese prickly ash, daylily, medicinal materials, and dried persimmons, as well as Northeast China's sunflower seeds. Representatives from the Suiyuan Province Native Produce Company and the Shanxi Province Native Produce Company signed an agreement to purchase 600,000 jin of ironware (various farm tools) from Shanxi Province. Pingyuan Province sold 500,000 chi of homespun cloth to Chahar Province to supply the needs of farmers in that province. Approximately one million jin of medicinal materials such as anemarrhena, bupleurum, and rehmannia glutinosa produced in disaster areas like Chahar and Pingyuan were sold. Fifty thousand jin of vitex twigs, which were previously unsalable in disaster areas such as Miyun and Huairou in Hebei Province, were also transacted. This symposium also opened up new markets for certain industrial raw materials. For example, Zhejiang's alum and Guangdong's rosin used to be transported and sold directly in Tianjin, and Suiyuan's natural alkali also used Tianjin as its sales location. This symposium decided to sell 180,000 jin of alum and over 100,000 jin of rosin to the Northeast region, and 180,000 jin of natural alkali to Henan Province, opening up trade routes for industrial raw materials such as alum and natural alkali to the distant Northeast and Henan.

The diverse transaction methods and simplified transaction procedures were the most significant features of this exchange, and all participating units expressed their appreciation. For example, the barter system truly achieved "turning slow-moving goods into popular items at both ends." Hebei Province exchanged red dates for Zhejiang's slow-moving brown sugar, and both parties exchanged them for items needed by farmers. Shanxi Province exchanged 220,000 jin of tobacco leaves for 50,000 cartons of cigarettes from the Huayang Cigarette Factory in Tianjin, enabling both the cigarettes and tobacco leaves to find a market. Methods such as spot transactions with deferred payments, sales on credit, and consignment sales also solved the problem of capital shortage for various units. In addition, a triangular exchange method was created. For example, a private merchant sold his accumulated Chinese prickly ash to the Tianjin office of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department. The office paid only half in cash, and the remaining half was exchanged for sunflower seeds. However, the private merchant did not want sunflower seeds but wanted brown sugar. The office then sold the sunflower seeds to the Tianjin Native Produce Company, which paid the private merchant brown sugar of equal value. This transaction method broke through the limitations of past bilateral transactions.

The success of the native products exchange symposium proves that gathering public and private trade units from various regions to exchange information and conduct transactions is an effective way to expand material exchange. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北土产交流座谈会成交总值三百多亿元
    中国土产公司华北区公司召开的土产交流座谈会，已在十八日结束。座谈会自十日开始交易以来，在八天中共签订了三百六十四份合同，四份协议，成交总值达三百三十八亿元，使部分地区滞销的土产特产找到了销路，同时供应了某些地区所需的工业原料。华北区的乌枣、红枣、黑枣、花椒、黄花菜、药材、柿饼，东北区的葵花子都有大量成交；绥远省土产公司代表和山西省土产公司代表订立了购买山西省六十万斤铁器（各种农具）的协议；平原省以五十万尺土布售给察哈尔省，供应该省农民需要。察哈尔、平原等灾区所产的知母、柴胡、生地等药材共销出约一百万斤。过去河北省密云、怀柔等灾区销不出去的荆条，也成交了五十万斤。这次座谈会还替某些工业原料打开了新的市场。如浙江的明矾、广东的松香过去直接运销天津，绥远的天然碱也以天津为销售地，这次座谈会决定将明矾十八万斤、松香十万多斤售与东北区，天然碱十八万斤售给河南省，开辟了明矾和天然碱等工业原料远销东北、河南的贸易路线。
    多种多样的成交方式及简便的成交手续，是这次交易中的最大特点，参加交易的各单位都表示欢迎。如以货换货的方式，真正做到了“冷货换冷货，两头变热货”。河北省的红枣和浙江滞销的红糖交换，双方都换成了农民所需要的东西。山西省以烟叶二十二万斤换了天津市华阳烟厂的纸烟五万条，使这部分纸烟和烟叶都得到了销路，又如现货期款、赊销、代销等方式，都解决了各单位缺乏资金的困难。此外还创造了三角交换的方式。如私商将积存的花椒售给东北人民政府贸易部驻津办事处，该处只给一半现款，其余一半以葵花子交换；但私商不要葵花子而要青糖，该处就将葵花子售给天津市土产公司，由该公司付给私商同等价值的青糖。这种交易方式，突破了过去双边交易的限制。
    土产交流座谈会的成绩，证明了各地区公私贸易单位聚集一起，交换情况，进行交易，是扩展物资交流的有效方式。    （新华社）
