We have no difficulties we cannot overcome
——Reminiscences of the teaching life at "Kangda"
Niu Kelun

Editor's note: The report of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on the national engineering college adjustment plan pointed out: "In the situation where the state finances are still difficult and the country urgently needs a large number of technical cadres, we must use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to solve the problem." In this regard, many schools and educators in the past and present have provided many valuable experiences. The three articles published here today introduce some examples of running schools with revolutionary spirit and methods, which can be used as a reference for educators in various places.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, I was filled with enthusiasm to go to the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an (hereinafter referred to as Kangda) to study; but before I went to Yan'an, someone told me: "Life in northern Shaanxi is too hard, you can't bear it, it's best not to go." Indeed, some students ran to Yan'an to take a look, couldn't bear the hardship, and left. At that time, I discussed with several classmates (all progressive youths), and everyone said in unison: "Don't be afraid of hardship, we must go." Because at that time, in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, we painfully felt the suffering of not having democratic freedom, and we didn't even have the right to speak of anti-Japanese democracy and freedom. So we were determined to rush to Yan'an. After being approved by the Eighth Route Army office in Xi'an, we took a long-distance bus and arrived victoriously in Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese people's revolution and the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in only one and a half days.

My goal was finally achieved. I was assigned to study in the third detachment of Kangda. At that time, the president was Comrade Lin Biao, and the education director was Comrade Liu Yalou. This was already the third phase, and all the students in the school were divided into three detachments. The students in the first and second detachments were all veteran cadres who had gone through the Long March, and the students in the third detachment were newly enlisted intellectuals.

At that time, the material life of the army and people in Yan'an was indeed very difficult, especially in terms of food, clothing, and housing. However, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the students finally overcame these difficulties with their own hands and completed the teaching tasks.

I remember very clearly that in order to overcome the shortage of school buildings, under the call and leadership of the school leaders, the students and faculty members launched a competition to dig cave dwellings. Many students who were used to school life outside participated in this arduous cave dwelling construction project with iron will and fiery enthusiasm for labor. Every morning, everyone carried hoes and shovels, pushed small carts, and walked to the construction site, singing "Building New School Buildings" while walking:

"Dig cave dwellings, build school buildings, it is our great cause.
Dig caves for learning, learn for the War of Resistance.
We are not afraid of any difficulties,
We are always brave and forward.
…………………………”

Everyone happily walked to the designated area—the loess slopes near Yan'an—to carry out tense and happy construction work. In just half a month, more than three hundred brand-new cave dwellings were neatly arranged in front of us.

After the housing problem was solved, the students immediately responded to the Party's call and actively participated in production to solve the difficulties of food and vegetables. The students persisted in studying on the one hand, and reclaimed wasteland on the mountains to plant crops such as sorghum, millet, and corn on the other hand, and also planted turnips, cabbage, pumpkins, and yams. We turned the wasteland into fertile fields with our own hands. We couldn't eat all the grain and vegetables we harvested, so we handed over the surplus as public grain to the government, helping the government to relieve many disaster victims. After the autumn, the students organized again, and used the dividends from production to buy spinning wheels, cotton, wool, etc., to carry out winter handicraft production. Everyone united, cooperated closely and happily, spinning yarn and weaving cloth. In just one winter's work, everyone got a sweater, a pair of gloves, and a pair of woolen socks. Because this was the fruit of their own labor, everyone felt especially warm wearing it. Some comrades' sweaters and gloves have been more than ten years old now, but they are still kept and reluctant to use, preparing to treat them as permanent souvenirs.

At that time, learning tools were also very difficult to obtain. There were no textbooks with costs, only some mimeographed teaching materials and simple stationery. These situations illustrate how difficult the material conditions in Yan'an were at that time; but we, like the people of Yan'an, shared the hardships, shared weal and woe, and united to overcome the difficulties. We felt infinite joy in our spirits. The detachment leaders often told us: Revolutionary work always has difficulties, but difficulties can be overcome. And they told us that a revolutionary must never bow to difficulties, but must carry forward the glorious tradition of the Red Army's hard work and struggle, and overcome difficulties. Especially when we knew and saw that Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee also lived in cave dwellings and lived a hard and simple life, everyone not only did not feel bitter about the current life, but also regarded being able to endure hardship and fight against difficulties as supreme revolutionary glory.

In Yan'an, one of the biggest difficulties for the school was the lack of teachers. The solution to this difficulty was to hire responsible comrades from various units as teachers, and to invite the central leaders to give reports (large lectures). At that time, Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, Kang Sheng, Wang Jiaxiang, and Zhang Wentian all gave us many reports. When the students heard that Chairman Mao was coming to give us a report, everyone was so happy that they didn't even want to eat, and only felt that time was passing too slowly. They discussed one after another: Why hasn't Chairman Mao come yet? When Chairman Mao came and walked onto the podium, many students jumped up, wanting to see their leader. In one of his speeches, Chairman Mao instructed everyone to strive to learn and master "a firm and unwavering political direction, flexible strategy and tactics, and a hard-working and simple work style." I will never forget these valuable instructions.

In 1938, when revolutionary youths from the Kuomintang-ruled areas poured into Yan'an like a tide, Kangda expanded the scope of the school in order to adapt to the new tasks. Due to the large number of people and the lack of housing, the first and fourth detachments moved from Yan'an to Panlong and Wayaobao. Both of these places had been ravaged by war. However, Wayaobao still had a considerable number of houses. Originally, we could have spent less labor to carry out teaching work, but because Wayaobao was a united front area at that time, the Kuomintang county government was extremely hostile to Kangda and did not allow the common people to give us better houses, but only allowed us to vacate some dilapidated houses or cave dwellings without doors or windows, with piles of garbage and weeds everywhere inside and outside. After we publicized and explained to the masses, the masses voluntarily gave us some houses, but it was still not enough to live in. On the one hand, in order to complete the teaching tasks, and on the other hand, in order to fight against the Kuomintang county government, all the faculty, staff, students, and administrative personnel once again carried forward the glorious tradition of hard work and overcoming difficulties. Everyone worked together, first removing the weeds, clearing the garbage, repairing the houses, installing doors and windows, and then using lime, white soil, and yellow soil to wash the interior and exterior, making the dilapidated houses into clean book houses. Without classrooms, the students used their own hands to transform dilapidated temples and sheep pens into very clean halls, with portraits of leaders hanging inside, and slogans and wall newspapers posted. When the weather was warm, the classrooms were set up in the square or on the hillside, and bricks and stones were stacked into tables and seats. A piece of black was painted on the wall with soot as a blackboard for class. When there was no chalk, the lime blocks removed from the wall were used as chalk. Some students, because they did not have dip pen nibs, used reeds and crow feathers to sharpen a sharp tip to replace steel pens; without notebooks, they found some old books, used the blank spaces between the lines and the blank spaces above and below to write, or turned them over to write. In short, all possible waste paper was used. In order to enliven cultural and entertainment life, the students often ran more than ten miles to carry sand to make sand pits for high jump and long jump; they used old wood to make horizontal bars, parallel bars, high jump racks, and basketball racks themselves. In a word, we overcame difficulties, transformed the learning environment, and shattered the obstruction given to us by the Kuomintang reactionaries with our own hands. In order to protect the interests of the people and our study life, and to prevent the Kuomintang reactionaries from invading and disrupting, we often took weapons and strictly guarded against enemy attacks.

Today, the Chinese people have won victory, and the schools have expanded even more. We have carried forward the fine traditions of Kangda and established various modern military schools: Advanced Infantry School, Aviation School, Artillery School, Naval School, etc. They are many times larger than Kangda in those years; and they are many times superior in teaching conditions. I think all the comrades who have lived in Kangda will feel infinitely excited and glorious for the development of the school. The development of the school is not accidental, but is the glorious result of the joint victory over difficulties and the defeat of domestic and foreign reactionary enemies under the leadership of the Party, especially under the personal training of Chairman Mao, together with the masses of the people. With the development and victory of the revolution, the school has gradually developed and grown, and it has cultivated tens of thousands of cadres for the people's army. (Attached picture)

    我们没有克服不了的困难
    ——回忆“抗大”的教学生活
    牛克伦
    编者按：中央人民政府教育部关于全国工学院调整方案的报告中指出：“在国家财政尚有困难，国家建设又迫切地需要大量技术干部的情况下，必须用革命的精神和革命的办法来解决问题。”在这一方面，过去和现在我们都有不少的学校和教育工作者提供了许多可贵的经验。今天我们在这里发表的三篇文章，就介绍了用革命的精神和办法办学的一些实例，可供各地教育工作者参考。
    一九三七年抗日战争爆发以后，我怀着满腔的热情，要到延安抗日军政大学（以下简称抗大）去学习；但在我还没有去延安的时候，就有人告诉我：“陕北生活太苦，受不了，最好是不要去。”的确，有的同学跑到延安看了看，受不了苦，便离开了。当时我和几个同学（都是进步的青年）商量了一下，大家异口同声地说：“不怕苦，一定要去。”因为那时在国民党统治区我们痛感没有民主自由的苦，我们连讲抗日民主自由的权利都没有。所以我们决心奔向延安。在西安经过八路军办事处的许可以后，我们便坐着长途汽车，只有一天半时间，便胜利地到达了当时中国人民革命的圣地、中国共产党中央所在地——延安。
    我的目的终于达到了。我被分配到抗大第三大队学习。那时的校长是林彪同志，教育长是刘亚楼同志。这时已是第三期了，全校学员分编为三个大队，第一、二大队的学员都是经过长征的老干部，第三大队的学员是新参军的知识分子。
    当时延安军民的物质生活确实是很困难的，特别是吃饭、穿衣、住房更困难。但同学们在党和毛主席的正确领导下，用自己的双手，终于战胜和克服了这些困难，完成了教学任务。
    我记得非常清楚，同学们为了克服校舍不足的困难，在校首长号召和领导下，和教职员一起，展开了挖窑洞的竞赛运动。许多在外面过惯学校生活的同学，都以钢铁般的意志、烈火般的劳动热情，参加了这个艰巨的窑洞建设工程。每天清早，大家荷着锄头、铁锨，推着小车子，走向工地，一边走，一边唱着“建设新校舍”歌：
    “挖窑洞，建校舍，是我们伟大的事业。
    挖窑为学习，学习为抗战。
    我们不怕任何困难，
    我们永远勇敢向前。
    …………………………”
    大家愉快地走向那指定的地区——延安附近的黄土山坡上，进行紧张而愉快的建设工作。只有半个月的时间，三百多个崭新的窑洞便整齐地排列在我们的面前了。
    房子问题解决以后，同学们紧接着又响应了党的号召，积极参加生产，解决食粮和菜蔬困难。同学们一面坚持学习，一面上山开荒，播种高粱、谷子、棒子等作物，又种了萝?、白菜、南瓜、山药蛋。用我们的双手把荒地变成了良田。收的粮食、菜蔬，我们自己吃不了，就把多余的当公粮交给了政府，帮助政府救济了不少灾民。秋后，同学们又组织起来，用生产分得的红利，买了纺线车、棉花、羊毛等，进行冬季手工业生产。大家亲密地愉快地团结合作，纺纱的纺纱，织布的织布，仅仅一个冬天的劳动，每人便得到了一件毛衣、一双手套和一双毛袜。因为这是自己亲手劳动的果实，穿在自己的身上，个个感到格外的温暖。有些同志的毛衣和手套到现在虽已十几年了，但还保存着舍不得用，准备把它们当作永久的纪念品。
    那时在学习用具方面也是非常困难的，没有什么成本的书，只有些油印的教材和简单的文具。这些情况，说明了当时延安的物质条件是多么的困难；但我们和延安人民一样，同艰苦，共患难，团结一致，克服了困难。我们在精神上感到无限的愉快。队首长经常给我们讲：革命工作总是有困难的，但困难是可以克服的。并告诉我们，一个革命者决不能向困难低头，要发扬红军的坚苦奋斗的光荣传统，战胜困难。尤其当我们知道和看见了毛主席、朱总司令和中共中央其他的领导同志，同样也住着窑洞，过着艰苦、朴素的生活的时候，大家对当前的生活不但没有感到苦，而且以能吃苦向困难作斗争为无尚的革命光荣。
    在延安时，学校的最大困难之一是没有教员，解决这个困难的办法，一个是聘请各单位的负责同志兼教员，一个是请中央的首长作报告（上大课）。当时毛主席、周恩来、任弼时、康生、王稼祥、张闻天等同志都曾给我们作过不少的报告。当同学们听说毛主席要来给我们作报告时，大家高兴得连饭都不想吃了，只感到时间过得太慢了。纷纷议论着：毛主席怎么还不来呢？当毛主席来了，走上讲台时，有许多同学都跳起来，想看看自己的领袖。毛主席在有一次讲话中，指示大家要努力学习和掌握“坚定不移的政治方向，机动灵活的战略战术，艰苦朴素的工作作风”。这些宝贵的指示，我是永远不会忘记的。
    一九三八年国民党统治区的革命青年像潮水一样地涌向延安时，抗大为了适应新的任务，扩大了学校的范围，在人多屋少的情况下，一、四大队从延安搬到蟠龙和瓦窑堡。这两个地方都是受过战争摧残的。但瓦窑堡的房子还是相当多的，本来我们可以少化费一些劳动，就能进行教学工作的，只因当时瓦窑堡是一个统一战线的地区，国民党的县政府极端仇视抗大，不允许老百姓把较好的房子让给我们，只许把一些破烂不堪、没有门没有窗子的破房子或破窑洞腾出来，室内外到处都是成堆的垃圾和荒草。经过我们向群众宣传解释后，群众才自动地给我们让出了一些房子，但仍不够住。我们一方面为了完成教学任务，同时也是为了和国民党的县政府进行斗争，全体教职学员和事务人员又一次发扬了坚苦奋斗克服困难的光荣传统，大家一齐动手，首先铲除了荒草，清除了垃圾，修理了房子，安好了门窗，然后又用石灰、白土、黄土把室内外刷洗得焕然一新，使破烂不堪的房子变成了一座座整洁的书舍。没有教室，同学们又用双手把破庙、羊圈改造成十分整洁的厅堂，里边挂着领袖像，贴着标语和墙报。在天气暖和时，就把教室安设在广场上或山坡上，用砖和石头叠成桌子和坐位。在墙上用烟灰涂上一片黑，作为上课用的黑板。没有粉笔的时候，就用从墙上拆下来的石灰块当粉笔。有的同学因为没有蘸水笔尖，就用苇子秆和乌鸦的羽毛，削上一个尖尖来代替钢笔使用；没有笔记本，就找一些破旧的书，利用行和行间的空白处和上下空白的地方写字，或翻过来写字。总之，一切可能利用的废纸都被利用了。为了活跃文化娱乐生活，同学们往往跑到十几里以外的地方去背沙子来做跳高跳远用的沙坑；利用旧木料自己制造单双杠、跳高架、篮球架。一句话，我们用自己的双手克服了困难，改造了学习环境，粉碎了国民党反动派所给予我们的阻挠。为了保卫人民的利益和我们的学习生活，不让国民党反动派来侵犯、捣乱，我们经常地拿着武器，严防着敌人的袭击。
    今天，中国人民胜利了，学校也更加扩大了。我们发扬了抗大的优良传统，建立了各种近代的军事学校：高级步兵学校、航空学校、炮兵学校、海军学校等。它们比起当年的抗大，不知要大多少倍；在教学条件上也不知优越多少倍。我想凡是住过抗大的同志们，一定会为学校的发展而感到无限的兴奋和光荣。学校的发展不是偶然的，是在党的领导下，特别是在毛主席的亲手培养下，同人民群众一起，共同战胜了困难，击败了国内外的反动敌人，才获得的光荣成果。随着革命的发展和胜利，学校也逐渐发展和壮大起来了，它为人民的军队培植了成千成万的干部。（附图片）
