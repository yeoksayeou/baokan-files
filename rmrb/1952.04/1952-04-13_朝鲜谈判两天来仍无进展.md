Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 11th: At the Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 11th, our representative pointed out that our two proposals for neutral nation nominees were the most reasonable solutions to this problem. We firmly oppose the unreasonable demand of so-called restrictions on airfield equipment within Korea, which is interference in our internal affairs. The other side remained silent for the second consecutive day, and the meeting made no progress.
