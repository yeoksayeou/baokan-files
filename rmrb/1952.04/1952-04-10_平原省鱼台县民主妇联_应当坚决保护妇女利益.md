    The Democratic Women's Federation of Yutai County, Pingyuan Province,
    Should Resolutely Protect Women's Interests
    Comrade Editor: A recent unfortunate incident occurred in Yutai County, Pingyuan Province. The situation is as follows:
    Jiang Yulan, from Liutianpu Village, Yutai County, is sixteen years old this year. In April of last year, she was forced to marry Ma Yuxiang of Wenxiangji Village in the same county (the Marriage Law stipulates that women can only marry at eighteen). After the marriage, the two had incompatible feelings. On March 11th of this year, Jiang Yulan filed for divorce, and the county's judicial section ruled to grant the divorce, and ordered the man to provide one dan of grain to the woman as a living allowance. Ma Yuxiang has held a grudge ever since. After the divorce, Jiang Yulan did not dare to return to her parents' home and sought help from the County Democratic Women's Federation to resolve her work and marriage issues. Director Xun of the County Women's Federation, fearing that it would "have a bad impact on the masses," was unwilling to intervene much in the matter, only letting Jiang Yulan stay for two or three days,
    and "with the consent of the Prefectural Women's Federation," allowed Jiang Yulan to return to her parents' home. On the night of March 23rd, Ma Yuxiang secretly brought a red-tasseled spearhead to Liutianpu Village. He found out that Jiang Yulan was sleeping in the Li family's house, so he dug open the back wall, crawled in, and dragged Yulan out. Ma Yuxiang threatened, "Will you come with me?" Yulan replied, "No!" Ma Yuxiang then forcibly dragged Yulan, beating her as he went, turning her into a bloody mess, beating her half to death. Seeing someone chasing after them, Ma Yuxiang finally let go and fled.
    Now, the criminal Ma Yuxiang has been arrested and brought to justice by the government, and Jiang Yulan has been sent to the hospital for treatment. I believe that the Yutai County Democratic Women's Federation is also responsible for Jiang Yulan's severe beating and injury, in addition to Ma Yuxiang's primary responsibility. If the Women's Federation had actively supported Jiang Yulan and helped her solve her problems, the above consequences would never have occurred. I suggest that the relevant leading departments investigate. And I hope that women's organizations in various places will learn a lesson from this.

### 平原省鱼台县民主妇联  应当坚决保护妇女利益

    平原省鱼台县民主妇联
    应当坚决保护妇女利益
    编辑同志：平原省鱼台县最近发生了一件不幸事件。情况如下：
    姜玉兰，鱼台县刘田铺村人，今年十六岁。去年四月间她被迫和本县文香集村马玉祥结婚（婚姻法规定妇女十八岁才可结婚）。婚后，两人情感不合。今年三月十一日，姜玉兰提出离婚，经县司法科判决准予离婚，并判决由男方出粮食一石给女方作为生活补助费。马玉祥自此怀恨在心。离婚后，姜玉兰不敢回娘家，求县民主妇女联合会帮助解决工作问题和婚姻问题。县妇联寻主任竟“怕对群众影响不好”，不愿多管此事，只留姜玉兰住了两三天，
    “经专区妇联同意”，便让姜玉兰回了娘家。三月二十三日夜间，马玉祥暗带红缨枪头子到刘田铺村。他探知姜玉兰睡在李家，便掘开后墙，钻进去把玉兰拉出。马玉祥威吓道：“跟我走不？”玉兰回答：“不！”马玉祥便强拉着玉兰，随走随打，把玉兰打成了血人，打得死去活来。后见有人追赶，马玉祥才撒手逃跑。
    现在，马犯玉祥已被政府逮捕法办，姜玉兰已送医院治疗。我认为，姜玉兰之所以被毒打重伤，除了马玉祥应负主要责任外，鱼台县民主妇联也是有责任的。如果该妇联积极地支持姜玉兰，帮助她解决问题，决不会发生上述恶果。我建议有关领导部门予以检查。并望各地妇女组织由此获得教训。
