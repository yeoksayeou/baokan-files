Xinhua News Agency, April 12th:

    The Vietnam Women's Union sent a telegram to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, expressing strong protest against the US aggressors' germ warfare. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Chairman Cai Chang of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation:
    We, all the women of Vietnam, warmly respond to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's call on "March 8th" to strongly protest the US imperialists' germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China.
    This is the most barbaric and shameless means of exterminating humanity and harming mankind. The monstrous crimes committed by the US imperialists have aroused our infinite anger and hatred. The Vietnamese women resolutely support the Chinese women's just denunciation and are determined to unite with the women and people of the world, actively fight tirelessly to eliminate the imperialist aggressors, strive for national independence, and defend world peace.
    President of the Vietnam Women's Union, Le Thi Xuyen

    【新华社十二日讯】越南妇女联合会致电中华全国民主妇女联合会，对美国侵略者进行细菌战表示强烈抗议。电文如下：中华全国民主妇女联合会蔡畅主席：
    我们越南全体妇女热烈响应中华全国民主妇女联合会在“三八”节所发出的强烈抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜、中国东北进行细菌战的号召。
    这是一个灭绝人性、戕害人类最野蛮而无耻的手段，美帝国主义者所犯下的这种滔天罪行，激起我们无比的愤怒与仇恨。越南妇女坚决拥护中国妇女正义的声讨，决心和全世界妇女和人民团结在一起，积极为消灭帝国主义侵略者，争取国家的独立，保卫世界的持久和平而进行不息的战斗。
