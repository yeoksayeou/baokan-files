    Xinhua News Agency, 21st — Residents of Bratislava, Southern Czechoslovakia, held a mass rally of 20,000 people on March 31st. At the meeting, Alexander Horak, member of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Slovak Peace Congress, delivered a speech sternly condemning the U.S. for conducting germ warfare. In his speech, Horak denounced the unprecedented crime of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people and listed specific facts to prove that U.S. imperialism had been preparing for germ warfare long ago. Horak pointed out that mankind had fought against all kinds of methods and terrible infectious diseases in the past, so it seems especially barbaric that now there are "people" who use artificial means to spread these infectious diseases in reverse. Horak said that since the statement issued by Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, the working people of all countries have raised angry protests, demanding an immediate end to this despicable war. In his speech, Horak also quoted the words of Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council: "The heinous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea are not only the massacre of peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's Armed Forces, but also a grave threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind." Horak called on all the people of Czechoslovakia to respond to the protests of the Chinese democratic parties against the bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. imperialism, and to take practical actions to stop the provocations of the American aggressors. He said: "It is not enough to protest only on paper. We must actively participate in this just struggle by strengthening our work and accelerating the completion of the Five-Year Plan."

    捷南部布拉的斯拉瓦城人民集会
    严斥美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二十一日讯】捷克斯洛伐克南部布拉的斯拉瓦城的居民，在三月三十一日举行二万人的群众大会。会上，世界和平理事会理事、斯洛伐克和平大会主席亚力山大·何拉克发表演说，严斥美国进行细菌战。在讲话中，何拉克斥责了美国侵略者向朝鲜人民和中国人民使用细菌武器的空前罪行，并列举具体事实，证明美帝国主义很久以前就在准备细菌战。何拉克指出：人类在过去曾用种种方法和可怕的传染病斗争，因此现在竟有“人”相反地用人工来撒布这些传染病，就显得格外野蛮。何拉克说：自世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里发表声明后，世界各国的劳动人民就纷纷提出愤怒的抗议，要求立即制止这种卑鄙的战争。在演讲中，何拉克并引用了世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若的话：“美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行不仅是对朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民武装力量的虐杀，它并且是对全世界和平和全人类安全的重大威胁。”何拉克号召所有捷克斯洛伐克人民响应中国各民主党派对于美帝国主义进行细菌战的抗议，并用实际行动来制止美国侵略者的挑衅。他说：“仅用纸上抗议是不够的，我们要用加强工作，加速五年计划的完成，来积极参加这一正义的斗争。”
