Former Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles Secretary Director Wang Cai Committed Serious Errors in Organizational Principles and Literary and Artistic Thought

Wang Cai (Communist Party member), the former Secretary Director of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, violated laws and regulations, disregarded organization, became degenerate and corrupt, and displayed deplorable character. During his tenure at the Federation, he openly opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, propagating erroneous bourgeois and petty-bourgeois viewpoints. Organizationally, he resisted superior leadership, developing into factionalism, forming a sectarian group, and implementing patriarchal rule. His series of errors have recently been exposed by many cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

During his time at the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Wang Cai openly took in a deserter—his nephew Wang Lilun—to work at the Federation. When other comrades criticized him, he ridiculed them, saying, "Everyone can talk about principles, but no one can follow them in practice." He also said, "I'm over thirty, with a wife and a large family. If I fall ill and die, or make a mistake at work, I need a place to settle down. My hometown has thirty or forty mu of land. If I don't take in Wang Lilun, I'll be letting down the elders in my hometown, and I won't be able to keep the land." After this matter was discovered by his superiors, he repeatedly resisted their orders and spread dissatisfied remarks among the masses, saying that the superior's decision to send his nephew back to his original unit was "how cruel the Party is to young people." Finally, seeing that he could no longer hide the truth, he colluded with backward elements, stole the Federation's official seal, secretly wrote a recommendation for his nephew, and transferred him to work at the Xinhua Bookstore. On the surface, he claimed not to know where his nephew had gone.

Wang Cai's attitude of outwardly agreeing but inwardly opposing and resolutely resisting the Party in this incident is unacceptable for a Communist Party member. His violation of laws and regulations and disregard for organization have reached an intolerable level.

Wang Cai's audacity in adopting such erroneous practices was not accidental. During his tenure at the Federation, he consistently attempted to cultivate a personal following to achieve his goal of implementing patriarchal rule. If a cadre criticized his egregious behavior, he would regard them as a "thorn in his side," believing that they were "competing for power" with him. He would either label them as "having political problems" or, acting arbitrarily and dictatorially, "dismiss" them. To implement patriarchal rule, he employed various base and shameless rogue tactics to suppress democracy and criticism. He once told cadres who offered him advice, "If you want to riot, I will suppress you." He also said that he would use a policy of "combining leniency with suppression" to treat them. On the other hand, he courted backward elements, formed a sectarian group, and opposed the superior leadership and the masses in the organization. To cultivate a personal following, he placed unlimited trust in people with unclear histories and touted and protected each other. The Federation's seal management, confidential archives, official document processing, expenditure, personnel matters, etc., were all handled by these people. Relying on Wang Cai's trust, these people usually acted like tyrants within the organization, disregarding laws and regulations. This resulted in a pervading atmosphere of evil within the organization, making it impossible for righteousness to prevail and causing significant damage to the work.

Wang Cai's lifestyle was also characterized by embezzlement, waste, corruption, and degeneration, single-mindedly pursuing bourgeois enjoyment and lifestyle. He personally controlled all the Federation's cash, as well as accounting and cashier work, approving expenditures with one hand and taking money with the other, spending lavishly and arbitrarily, as he pleased. He even had the public funds reimburse his private dinners at restaurants. Despite not needing it for work, he insisted on spending a lot of money to buy a camera, which he often carried around to show off and flaunt his wealth. He usually indulged in eating, drinking, and merrymaking, neglecting his duties. He often drank alcohol and slept during the day, while the lights burned all night, and danced with a chair in his arms when drunk. Not only did he engage in improper relationships with women, but he also frequently beat his lover. On one occasion, he even bruised the face of his lover, Zhu Yizhen. When he was happy, he would lie on the sofa in his office, holding a book of "Tang Poems," and shouting with wild abandon, "Wang Cai is me, I am Wang Cai, Wang Cai is so happy!" In the autumn of 1950, Wang Cai, feeling bored, called a female singer upstairs to his room to play music for his "appreciation." To show his "generosity," he immediately "awarded" her 10,000 yuan, shamelessly justifying it as "learning folk art and caring for the livelihood of female artists." This 10,000 yuan was also charged to the public account. When others criticized his decadent bourgeois lifestyle, he retorted, "Cultural people are somewhat free and undisciplined."

As a Party literary and art worker, especially one of the leaders of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Wang Cai's most serious error was that he openly opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line and propagated erroneous bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and artistic ideas in his work, spreading a very bad influence among some literature and art enthusiasts.

In this regard, Wang Cai's errors were mainly manifested in his creative thinking, creative attitude, attitude towards criticism, views on popularization and improvement, and views on Chinese and foreign literary heritage.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had long made it clear, and the facts of many years have proven, that without long-term and in-depth revolutionary struggle practice, one cannot create works with life. However, Wang Cai openly declared, "Creation can do without life." At a business study discussion meeting of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles cadres, he said: "Creation can do without life. Even if it is needed, there is life everywhere, and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles is life..." He believes that: "Literature and art are the high sublimation of human emotions." "Poetry is the high sublimation of the poet's emotions, and is the product of the poet's emotions developing to a selfless, almost insane state." However, this theory of "emotion" is a thoroughgoing idealist preaching, and the absurdity and reactionary nature of this erroneous bourgeois ideological viewpoint is well known. Wang Cai is precisely using this absurd argument to cover up his extreme poverty of life, the essential issue of separation from the people, clinging to the old and refusing to let go, and sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of being detached from politics, detached from the people, and detached from real life.

Wang Cai has consistently looked down on Chinese folk literature and art, looked down on popular literary and artistic works, and even the excellent people's literary and artistic works that have been practiced in the liberated areas for many years in the direction of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and are popular with the masses have also been despised by him. He said: "Chinese percussion instruments are the most primitive and barbaric things, and have no artistic value at all." He believes that learning folk songs will lead to vulgarity; learning traditional forms is "restoring the old." He said that sentences like "The East is red, the sun rises" are not good, and shouted "Save poetry!" And rejoices in his own works. He is not concerned about the works of the working class.

Wang Cai's creative attitude is extremely unserious, vulgar, and bourgeois. In Wang Cai's eyes, literary and artistic creation is precisely a "tool for making money." He calls the publication and publication of works "sold out," he said: "Creation must occupy a few sites (places to publish works)", he regards literary and artistic creation as a kind of "business" that can "gain both fame and fortune."

Wang Cai adopted a very rude and barbaric attitude towards others' criticisms of him. For example, the "Guangming Daily" "Literary Review" column made criticisms of one of his poems. Not only did he not humbly consider other people's opinions, but he also lost his temper and hid the newspaper, fearing that others would see it.

Wang Cai's evaluation of today's people's writers and works is not based on the standpoint of the Party and the people, using proletarian thought, and using Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line to measure it, but based on his own likes and dislikes, using his own vulgar sectarian prejudice to praise or slander a person or a work.

He believes that a certain writer's fame "is completely touted."

Is it said that today the success and welcome of the works of a revolutionary writer and artist are all "touted" by someone? Is there any common ground between our recommendation or criticism of a work today and the sectarian disputes of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie who attack and tout and tout each other for fame and fortune?

Wang Cai's mistakes are extremely serious. He has lost the qualifications of a revolutionary literary and art worker. Wang Cai should face up to his mistakes and deeply criticize his erroneous thinking. The relevant departments should also seriously deal with Wang Cai's problems.

    前武汉市文联秘书主任王采在组织原则和文艺思想上都有严重错误
    武汉市文联前秘书主任王采（共产党员），违法乱纪，目无组织，堕落腐化，品质恶劣。他在文联工作期间，更公开敌视毛主席的文艺方针，宣扬资产阶级和小资产阶级的错误观点；在组织上则对抗上级领导，发展成为山头主义，组成宗派集团，施行家长统治。他的这一连串错误，最近已为武汉市文联许多干部揭发出来。
    王采在武汉市文联任职期间，曾公然收容了一个逃兵——他的侄子王利伦到文联来工作。别的同志批评他，还遭到他的讥讽，他说：“原则问题谁都会说一套，碰到实际问题谁都行不通。”又说：“自己年过三十，老婆、孩子一大群，万一病倒不幸死亡，或工作中犯了错误，应该有个安身之处；我家乡还有三、四十亩地，不收容王利伦，对不起家乡父老，田地也将保不住了。”待此事被上级发觉后，他又三番两次地抗拒上级命令，并在群众中间散布不满言论，说上级决定要将他的侄子送回原部队处理是“党对年青人何其残忍”。最后，他见实在隐瞒不住，又串通落后分子，盗用文联公章，暗地里为他侄子作鉴定，转介绍到新华书店工作。表面上则诿称不知道他的侄子上那里去了。
    王采在这一事件中对党所采取的阳奉阴违、坚决抵抗的态度，对于共产党员来说，这是不能允许的。其违法乱纪、目无组织，已达到令人不可容忍的地步。
    王采之所以敢于采取这样错误的作法并不是偶然的。他在文联工作期间，一贯地企图培植私人势力，以求达到其施行家长统治的目的。那一个干部若对他的恶劣作风提出批评，他就视之为“眼中钉”，认为别人在和他“争权”，轻则扣帽子，说是“有政治问题”，重则独断独行，“开除”了事。为了施行家长统治，他采用各种卑鄙无耻的流氓手段，压制民主，压制批评。他曾对那些向他提意见的干部说过：“你们要暴动，我就要镇压。”还说要用“宽大与镇压相结合”的政策来对待他们。另一方面，又拉拢落后分子，组成宗派集团，和上级领导人员以及机关群众相对抗。为了培植私人势力，他对历史不清的人无限信任，并互相标榜，互相包庇。文联的图章保管，机密档案及公文处理，经费开支、人事问题等等，都交这些人包办。这些人倚仗王采的信任，平常在机关内部便作威作福，无法无天。弄得机关内部邪气冲天，正气不能伸张，给工作造成很大损失。
    王采在生活作风上也是贪污浪费、腐化堕落，一心一意追求资产阶级的享受和生活方式。他一个人掌握了文联的全部现金以及会计、出纳工作，一只手批条子，一只手拿钱，滥发滥用，随心所欲。他私人请客上馆子也都要由公家报销。明明工作上并不需要，偏要花很多钱买个照相机，经常背在身上摆样子，装阔气。平素更吃喝逍遥，不务正业。常常白天酗酒睡觉，夜晚灯火通宵，酒醉后抱着椅子跳舞。他不但闹不正当的男女关系，还经常打骂自己的爱人，有一次竟把他的爱人朱益珍的脸打得青肿。他高兴的时候，就仰睡在办公室的沙发上，捧着一本“唐诗”，得意忘形地大喊大叫：“王采是我，我是王采，王采好快活！”一九五零年秋，王采闲极无聊，叫一个卖唱女子上楼到房里来弹曲子给自己“欣赏”，为了表示“大方”，当即“赏赐”一万元人民币，还恬不知耻地美其名曰：“学习民间艺术，照顾女艺人生活。”这一万元也要上到公家账上。别人批评他这种腐朽的资产阶级生活作风时，他还振振有辞：“文化人是有些自由散漫的。”
    作为一个党的文艺工作者，尤其是武汉市文联的负责人之一的王采，特别严重的是，他还公开敌视毛主席的文艺方针，在自己的工作中宣扬了资产阶级、小资产阶级的错误的文艺思想，在一部分爱好文艺的群众中间散播了极坏的影响。
    在这方面，王采的错误主要地表现在创作思想、创作态度、接受批评的态度、对普及和提高的看法、对中外文学遗产的看法等等问题上。
    毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中早已明确指示，并已为多年的事实所证明：没有长期的深入的革命斗争实践，是不能创作出有生命的作品的。但是，王采却公开宣称：“创作可以不要生活。”他在一次市文联干部业务学习讨论会上说：“创作可以不要生活。即使要，那么什么地方都有生活，文联即生活……”他认为：“文艺，是人底感情的高度升华。”“诗，是诗人底感情的高度升华，是诗人底感情发展到忘我的、类乎疯人的境地时的产物。”但是，这种“感情”论是彻头彻尾的唯心论的说教，这种错误的资产阶级思想观点的荒谬性、反动性是尽人皆知的。而王采正是借着这种荒谬的论点来掩饰他生活的极度贫乏，脱离人民的本质问题，抱残守缺，死不放松，并日甚一日地陷入脱离政治、脱离人民、脱离现实生活的泥沼中。
    王采一贯地看不起中国的民间文艺，看不起通俗文艺作品，甚至在解放区多年来实践了毛主席文艺方向的受群众欢迎的优秀的人民文艺作品，也受到他的轻视。他说：“中国的打击乐器是最原始的、野蛮的东西，根本没有艺术价值。”他认为学习民间的诗歌会流于庸俗；学习传统形式就是“复古”。他说“东方红，太阳升”等句子不好，大呼“救救诗吧！”而沾沾自喜于他自己的作品。对于工人群众的作品，他是不关心的。
    王采的创作态度是极不严肃的，庸俗的，资产阶级式的。在王采的眼中，文艺创作正是“赚钱的工具”。他称作品的发表和出版是“卖出去了”，他说：“创作必须要站几个地盘（发表作品的地方）”，他把文艺创作当成一种可以“名利双收”的“营业”。
    王采对待别人对他的批评采取了非常粗暴、野蛮的态度。如“光明日报”“文学评论”栏对他的一首诗提出了批评，他不但不虚心考虑别人的意见，还大发脾气，并把该报藏起来，唯恐别人看到。
    王采对于今天人民的作家和作品的评价，不是站在党和人民的立场，用无产阶级思想、用毛泽东文艺方针去衡量的，而是根据他自己的好恶，用他自己那种庸俗的宗派偏见，去颂扬或诽谤一个人或一篇作品的。
    他认为某作家的成名“完全是被捧起来的”。
    难道说今天一个革命的文学家、艺术家底作品的成功和被人民欢迎，都是什么人“捧”起来的吗？难道我们今天对一部作品的推荐或批评与资产阶级、小资产阶级为名为利因而互相攻讦、互相标榜、吹嘘的宗派纠纷有任何共同之点吗？
    王采的错误，是极严重的。他已经丧失了一个革命的文艺工作者的资格。王采应正视自己的错误，深刻批判自己的错误思想。有关部门对于王采的问题也应作严肃处理。
