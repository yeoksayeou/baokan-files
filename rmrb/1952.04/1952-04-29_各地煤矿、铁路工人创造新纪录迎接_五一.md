Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: Coal miners and railway workers across the country have been setting new national records one after another to welcome International Labor Day on "May Day." The Second Team of the Guoqing Brigade of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine under the State-owned Huainan Mining Bureau implemented the "Cyclical Chart System," and on April 21st, they created a new national record of an average of 20.049 tons of coal mined per person per eight-hour shift on the working face. The construction workers of the new shaft of the State-owned Huainan Mining Bureau, who applied the "drilling and masonry method," further improved their work methods and, on April 12th, increased the single-shift shaft lining footage from 3.5 meters, the new record set during the "Three-Anti" movement, to 6.1 meters, setting a new national shaft lining record. The pickaxe coal miners of the Wangjiayuan Mine in the Pingxiang Coal Mine, who have repeatedly set new national records, were further encouraged by the enthusiasm to welcome "May Day" and have continued to set new national records in mining medium-hard coal seams. On the morning shift of April 10th, worker Xiao Tingyu of No. 1 shaft adopted Ma Yuquan's double-slot mining method and, on a working face with one-quarter hard coal and three-quarters hard coal, mined 144.69 tons of coal in eight hours, exceeding the original production quota by six and a half times. On April 11th, worker Liu Chongchun of No. 1 shaft used the same method on the same coal seam working face and mined 166.95 tons of coal in the same amount of time, exceeding the original production quota by seven and a half times.

In the railway system, the Yu Guoxiang crew of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau created a new national record for axle overload traction of 厶?(7) type locomotives in the labor competition to welcome "May Day." On April 13th, they hauled 117 freight cars with a net weight of 5,070 tons, an overload of 2,970 tons. On April 22nd, the Zheng Xikun crew of the No. 105 locomotive of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot in the Northeast created a new national record of 1,216 locomotive-day kilometers. They used the advanced experience of Soviet locomotive drivers, making nearly two round trips between Sujiatun and Changchun in 24 hours. On April 23rd, the No. 252 crew of the 冂丂(一) type locomotive of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, following April 10th, once again set a new national record for axle overload traction of the 冂丂(一) type locomotive. The crew, including driver Wang Kequan, co-driver Wei Sicai, and fireman Zhao Rushan, safely hauled 10,111 tons between Daguantun and Sujiatun, with an axle overload of 7,711 tons, more than three times the quota.
