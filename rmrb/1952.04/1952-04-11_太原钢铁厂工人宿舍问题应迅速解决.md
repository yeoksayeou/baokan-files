    The Worker Dormitory Problem at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Must Be Resolved Quickly
    To the Editor: The dormitory problem for employees of our Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is very serious. Cadres at the section chief level in our plant live in Class B dormitories, with one family occupying a large house. Workers, on the other hand, live in unused toilets or bathhouses. In one collective bathhouse, three or four couples reside. Employees have repeatedly raised concerns, and the leading cadres have made a self-criticism regarding this matter. However, the problem has not been resolved. For example, several workers were transferred from a certain factory to our plant in June of the year before last, and they have been living in the original factory dormitory ever since. Due to repeated urging from the factory, Section Chief Niu Tianming and Section Chief Zheng of our plant's property section allocated three rooms to six families totaling eighteen people. On average, two families live in one room. When these workers pointed out that a certain dormitory had more than seventy empty rooms, Section Chief Zheng and others became furious, saying, "We have rooms, but we just won't give them to you. What can you do to me?" When the workers tried to reason with him, Section Chief Zheng actually pushed them out the door. During the Three-Anti Campaign, Section Chief Zheng still adopts a bureaucratic attitude toward his work, which is intolerable. We hope that higher authorities will send people to the factory to investigate and help the workers solve the dormitory problem.

    太原钢铁厂工人宿舍问题应迅速解决
    编辑同志：我们太原钢铁厂职工的宿舍问题是很严重的。我厂科长一级的干部住的是乙种宿舍，一家占用一所大房子。工人们则有的住在不用的厕所里，有的住在澡堂里，有一个集体澡堂内就住了三、四对夫妻。职工再三提出意见，领导干部才对这件事作了一次检讨。但问题并没有解决。比如，我厂在前年六月从某厂调来几个工人，他们一直住在原来的工厂宿舍里。由于某厂数次催促，我厂房产科牛天明科长、郑科长才按六家十八口人分配给三间房子。平均一间房子住两家人。这些工人当时提出某个宿舍有七十多间空房，郑科长等听了就大发雷霆，说：“房子有，就是不给，你们能把我怎么样？”工人们向他说理，郑科长竟把工人推出门外。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，郑科长还是用官僚主义的态度对待工作，这是不能容忍的。我们希望上级派人来厂检查，帮助工人解决宿舍问题。
