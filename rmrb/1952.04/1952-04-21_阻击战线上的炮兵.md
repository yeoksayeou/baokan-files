    Artillery on the Blocking Front
    Zhang Tao, Zhang Lixin
    On the Imjin River front, there is a volunteer army artillery unit that has repeatedly made meritorious contributions. Here, the artillerymen carefully use a small number of shells to continuously inflict casualties on large numbers of enemy troops.
    In winter, on the snow-covered mountain positions, the artillery observers' eyes are constantly on the gun sights, vigilantly monitoring the enemy's movements and searching for the enemy. In the midst of the snowstorm, the observers' hands and feet are frozen numb, and their clothes are covered with a thin layer of ice, but their eyes are still fixed on the front. The heroic gunners guard the cannons day and night, rubbing the shells until they are crystal clear with their numb hands; as soon as the firing order arrives, groups of shells will roar out, giving the enemy a devastating blow.
    One day, the observer discovered two enemy howitzer companies and seven trucks full of infantry advancing along the road in the ditch in the gun sight, and stopped for a while. After receiving the report, the artillery commander carefully observed again, and then issued an order to the troops to prepare to destroy the enemy artillery group. Nine trial shells flew towards the enemy's position with a sharp whistle, and the observer reported a hit. Then, the formal bombardment began, and suddenly, a cloud of smoke rose in the gully, and it was impossible to see whether it was the body of the car, the body of the gun, or the enemy's corpse that was blown up by the shells. The enemy issued three green distress signals, and soon two enemy helicopters flew to the gully and landed. The artillery warriors bombarded the enemy planes again, and the helicopters burst into two flames and could no longer fly. The fire burned until dark. This time, the warriors used one hundred and seventeen shells to wipe out most of the enemy's two artillery companies and seven cars and two helicopters.
    On another occasion, six enemy heavy tanks, covered by seven trucks full of infantry, crossed the Imjin River and headed north, pressing towards our forward position. The gunners accepted the task of eliminating the enemy. The "position club's" broadcasting tube immediately shouted: "Comrades, aim and fire! Use the least amount of shells to eliminate the enemy!" The gunners aimed and test-fired more carefully, and the second shot hit a tank. Then, many shells seemed to have eyes, and every shot landed in the tank group. Five tanks immediately caught fire and stopped moving. The enemies in the car wanted to break out and escape, and a burst of fierce shells pressed down again, hitting the enemies like mice in a fire, running around and jumping. Before long, no living person could be found in the gun sight. This time, the gunners created a brilliant example of using seventy-four shells to destroy five tanks, seven cars, and completely wipe out more than one hundred and fifty enemies, and were commended by their superiors.
    The day after the Spring Festival, the soldiers were happily celebrating the festival. Suddenly, the observer at the forward position called to report that the enemy's five tanks were firing on our infantry positions from the east of the Imjin River. The gunners said:
    "If you want to fight, then fight! Destroy this group of tanks and congratulate Chairman Mao on the festival!" Within five minutes, the cannon was pushed into the position, and the third test shot destroyed a tank. The other tanks fled into the ditch in a panic. The shells followed closely into the gully, destroying two more tanks. The other two were also seriously injured. At this time, the enemies who did not know whether to live or die drove two more cars and six or seven motorcycles to reinforce them, and they were immediately smashed to pieces by our roaring shells.
    In order to strike at the enemy's harassment, the artillery often cooperated with the infantry to conduct small-scale counterattacks against the enemy. On one occasion, the artillery received an order to cooperate with the infantry to eliminate the enemy guarding an unnamed highland west of Gaoyangdai, southwest of Shuoning. Early in the morning, the observer lay in the snowdrift and observed the enemy's position with a gun sight. In the position, the gunners took off their cotton clothes and, braving the severe cold, made all preparations for firing. The destruction firing began, the fortifications on the enemy's position were all collapsed, and the enemy's artillery was also silenced. The infantry warriors rushed into the enemy's position in the smoke, and seven minutes later, three red signals to occupy the position rose in the sky, and all fifty-odd guards were wiped out.
    From winter to spring, the artillery warriors fought day and night on this mountain position, not giving up every opportunity to kill the enemy. According to the statistics of a certain artillery company alone: from December last year to mid-March this year, they killed or wounded 580 enemies and destroyed or damaged 24 enemy tanks. The gunners proudly said: "We will give the enemy a heavier and heavier blow!" (Xinhua News Agency)

### 阻击战线上的炮兵

    阻击战线上的炮兵
    张涛  张立信
    在临津江前线，有一支屡立战功的志愿军炮兵部队。在这里，炮兵们精打细算地用少数炮弹不断杀伤大批敌军。
    冬天，在冰雪覆盖着的山岭阵地上，炮兵观测员的眼睛时刻不离炮队镜，警惕地监视着敌方的动静，搜索着敌人。在漫天风雪中，观测员的手脚冻麻木了，衣服上结着一层薄冰，但他们的双眼仍紧紧盯着前方。英勇的炮手们不分昼夜地守在大炮边，用冻麻木的双手把炮弹擦得晶亮；只等射击命令一到，马上就有成群的炮弹飞啸而出，给敌人以歼灭性的打击。
    有一天，观测员在炮队镜里发现了敌人两个榴弹炮连，和七辆满载步兵的大卡车沿着沟里的公路前进，并一忽停下来了。炮兵指挥员接到报告后又仔细地观察了一番，然后向部队发出准备将敌人炮群摧毁的命令。九颗试射的炮弹带着尖啸飞向敌阵，观测员报告命中目标。接着，正式轰击开始了，顿时，那边山沟里腾起一片烟雾，看不清被炮弹炸飞起来的是车身、炮身还是敌人的尸体。敌人发出了三颗绿色的求援信号，一会儿敌人的两架直升飞机飞到沟里降落。炮兵勇士们对准敌机又是一阵猛烈的轰击，直升飞机冒起两股火焰，再也飞不起来了。大火一直烧到天黑。这一次勇士们用一百十七发炮弹，就歼灭了敌人两个炮兵连的大部和七辆汽车、两架直升飞机。
    又有一次，敌人的六辆重型战车，掩护着七辆满载步兵的大卡车渡过临津江北来，逼向我前沿阵地。炮手们接受了消灭敌人的任务。“阵地俱乐部”的广播筒马上叫唤起来：“同志们，瞄准打呀！用最少的炮弹去消灭敌人！”炮手们更加细心地瞄准试射，第二发就打中了一辆战车，接着，许多炮弹都像长了眼睛似地，发发都落在战车群里。五辆战车立时冒起大火不动了。汽车上的敌人想夺路逃跑，一阵猛烈的炮弹又压下去，打得敌人像火团里的老鼠，乱跑乱跳。不一会，炮队镜里就再也找不到一个活的了。这次，炮手们创造了用七十四发炮弹击毁战车五辆、汽车七辆，全歼敌人一百五十余名的光辉战例，受到了上级的表扬。
    春节后的第二天，战士们正在愉快地过节。忽然前沿阵地的观测员打电话来报告，敌人五辆战车上的炮火从临津江东向我步兵阵地射击。炮手们说：
    “要打就打，摧毁这群战车，给毛主席贺节！”五分钟内，炮就被推进了阵地，试射的第三发就击毁了一辆战车。其他的战车慌忙向沟里逃跑。炮弹紧跟着逼进了山沟，又击毁了两辆战车。另外有两辆也负了重伤。这时，不知死活的敌人又开来两辆汽车和六、七辆摩托车增援，立刻又被我们怒啸的炮弹打得落花流水。
    为了打击敌人的窜扰，炮兵们也常常配合步兵向敌人进行小规模的反击。有一次，炮兵接到命令，配合步兵消灭朔宁西南高阳岱以西一个无名高地的守敌。一早，观测员就伏在雪堆里用炮队镜观测着敌人阵地的动静。在阵地里，炮手们脱掉棉衣，冒着严寒，做好一切射击准备。摧毁射击开始了，敌人阵地上的工事都被打塌了，敌炮也被打成了哑叭。步兵勇士们在硝烟中冲进了敌阵，七分钟后，天空升起三颗占领阵地的红色信号，五十多名守敌全部被歼。
    从寒冬到春季，炮兵勇士们日日夜夜地战斗在这山岭阵地上，不放弃每一个杀敌的时机。仅据某炮兵连的统计：自去年十二月到今年三月中旬，即杀伤敌人五百八十名，击毁、击伤了敌战车二十四辆。炮手们自豪地说：“我们还要给敌人以沉重更沉重的打击！”    （新华社）
