    Revolutionary Cadres Should Not Be Superstitious and Wasteful
    Shen Ce, a section chief of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, returned to his hometown (Shenjiaya Village, Chaoxian County, northern Anhui) in January this year with two orderlies to sweep his ancestors' graves. For the purpose of sweeping the graves, he bought a ton of straw paper (72 stacks, at 2,000 yuan per stack), prepared twelve dishes (large basins), and also fired a native-made gun (using half a jin of gunpowder). Afterwards, he threw a large banquet, using more than two shi of rice. The total cost was 500,000 yuan. The masses and village cadres have opinions on this matter. We believe that Comrade Shen Ce should make a self-criticism.

    革命干部不应迷信和浪费
    上海市人民政府某股长沈策，在今年一月间，带着两个通讯员，回到他的家乡（皖北巢县沈家衙村）扫墓。他为了扫墓，买了一吨草纸（七十二刀，每刀人民币二千元），办了十二品（大盆子）菜，还放了土枪（用去火药半斤）。随后，他又大请客，用去大米二石多。以上合计用去人民币五十万元。群众和村干部对这件事都有意见。我们认为，沈策同志应作检讨。
