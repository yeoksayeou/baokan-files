Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 15th: The Northeast People's Government recently held its 24th administrative meeting, at which Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, gave extremely important instructions on this year's agricultural production guidelines and related policies. He called on all farmers and all rural work cadres to act quickly and intensively to complete spring plowing without missing the agricultural season, and to launch a vigorous patriotic production increase campaign throughout the region.

Gao Gang instructed: The most important thing at present is to immediately strengthen the leadership of spring plowing production. He pointed out: Spring plowing is the most central task that overrides everything else in the countryside at present, and spring plowing is decisive for this year's agricultural production. Party committees and people's governments at all levels, as well as mass organizations, must devote all their efforts to leading spring plowing, quickly organize forces, led by responsible cadres, to go deep into the countryside to check the preparation of fertilizers, seeds, carts, horses, farm tools, etc., and promptly solve problems as they are discovered and disseminate good experiences in a timely manner. Each provincial people's government should report to the Northeast People's Government on the situation of spring plowing production every five days. Counties, districts, and villages should all convene people's representative meetings to focus on discussing the importance of spring plowing production and agricultural production policies, mobilize all forces, and launch a spring plowing production campaign. In order to devote all forces to leading spring plowing, all counties that have carried out the "Three-Anti" campaign, regardless of whether the campaign should be ended or not, whether the problems have been dealt with or not, should all be temporarily suspended. County-level机关 cadres who have been found to have committed corruption but have not yet been dealt with may be allowed to atone for their crimes by making contributions in organizing spring plowing, as long as they are not serious embezzlers. County, district, and village cadres who have committed errors of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, as long as they actively work hard in leading production and achieve results, will be treated leniently or exempted from punishment; those who are passively lazy will be punished more severely. Village cadres who took small advantages and took more fruits of struggle in the past land reform will not be held accountable as long as they review their mistakes and correct them well.

Regarding the trial operation of agricultural production cooperatives, Gao Gang pointed out: There were about 100 agricultural production cooperatives in the region during last year's autumn harvest, but according to incomplete statistics, they have now suddenly increased to more than 1,200. Some of them are organized according to the farmers' production needs, ideological awareness, especially with relatively rich experience in cooperation and mutual assistance, and with strong backbone leadership. The production achievements of such production cooperatives not only greatly exceed those of individual farmers but also exceed those of general mutual aid groups, and thus have won the support of the masses. However, many other agricultural production cooperatives are not organized according to the above conditions, but are "boomed" up solely by the enthusiasm of cadres and a few activists, or even forcibly compiled by a few cadres using compulsory orders. The result of such production cooperatives is very bad, creating a bad impression among the masses and increasing the difficulty for the development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future. Therefore, the leading aspects of various regions should pay attention: when organizing agricultural production cooperatives, they must be based on the aforementioned conditions and directly controlled by the county's leadership; generally, each county should only try to run one or two this year. In the northern Manchuria regions with a better foundation of cooperation and mutual assistance, when the aforementioned conditions are met and there is full certainty, each district can also try to run one under the direct control of the district (those who do not have the conditions and are not sure should not be organized at all). All those organized in this way are only allowed to be run well, not badly, so as to serve as a typical demonstration, gain experience, and then promote it next year. In all regions where conditions are not mature, or agricultural production cooperatives are organized by cadres using compulsory orders, cadres and activists among the masses should be persuaded to reorganize into various forms of mutual aid groups.

Regarding the issues of hiring labor, lending, land buying and selling and renting, and the exchange of labor and horses in mutual aid and cooperation, Gao Gang pointed out: The Communist Party and the People's Government generally allow the hiring of labor in terms of policy. A distinction should be made between the fact that Communist Party members are not allowed to hire labor and the fact that the policy generally allows the hiring of labor. Labor wages should be determined according to the conditions in each region, but they should not be too low. In principle, the hiring of labor is not allowed within mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, but during the busy farming season, short-term workers and technical workers may be allowed for production needs. In order to invigorate the rural economy, legitimate lending between private individuals should be allowed and encouraged. The highest interest rate on grain loans should not exceed one斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) borrowed in spring and 1.5 斗 repaid in autumn. The highest interest rate on money loans should not exceed 3% per month. Those exceeding the above provisions will be treated as usury. In order to crack down on usury, in addition to state banks and cooperatives actively carrying out rural credit business, it is also necessary to persuade Party members, labor models, village cadres, and people's representatives to implement the above interest rate provisions. The buying and selling and renting of land must be appropriately restricted. Landlords, old rich peasants, and unproductive people who try to evade labor are generally not allowed to sell and rent land, and they must be forced to engage in labor, transform them in labor, and make them self-reliant. Those who are properly changing careers, such as becoming doctors, teachers, or working in factories, should not be restricted; widows, widowers, orphans, and the disabled who have lost their labor power are also allowed to rent out their land. Mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives are allowed to rent in or exchange land under the voluntary conditions of farmers for the convenience of production. The amount of rent should generally not exceed 20% of the annual output of the land after deducting agricultural investment and the payment of public grain, and widows, widowers, the disabled, and the handicapped may be allowed to increase it appropriately. The exchange of human labor for horse labor must be equivalent and mutually beneficial. Within a few years, the use of horse-drawn farm tools will be promoted throughout the Northeast region, so it is necessary to breed horses and make horse-owning households profitable, while also avoiding causing losses to households without horses.

In order to implement Chairman Gao Gang's instructions, the Northeast People's Government has formed inspection teams to inspect spring plowing in various places. The inspection teams are respectively led by Du Zheheng, Minister of Agriculture, Yan Guhang, Director of the Northeast Cooperative Business Management Committee, Wang Yifu, Minister of Civil Affairs, and Wang Guangwei, Director of the General Office of the Northeast People's Government, and set off on April 8 to Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang provinces. Before the inspection teams set off, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, also made specific arrangements for their work. Lin Feng instructed them to go to the provinces to convey Chairman Gao Gang's instructions well, implement them in actual work, and also to go deep into the countryside, understand the situation of spring plowing production, discover problems, and solve problems.

    东北人民政府召开第二十四次行政会议
    高岗同志指示加强春耕生产领导
    组成检查组分赴吉林、辽东、辽西、黑龙江等省检查春耕
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北人民政府最近召开的第二十四次行政会议上，东北人民政府主席高岗对今年的农业生产方针和有关政策，作了极重要的指示。他号召所有农民和一切农村工作干部，迅速地紧张地行动起来，不误农时地完成春耕，要在全区展开一个轰轰烈烈的爱国增产竞赛运动。
    高岗指示说：当前最重要的是必须立即加强春耕生产的领导。他指出：春耕是目前农村压倒一切的最中心的任务，春耕对于今年农业生产有决定的意义。各级党委和人民政府以及群众团体，都要全力领导春耕，迅速组织力量，由负责干部带头，深入农村，检查肥料、种籽、车马、农具等各种准备工作，发现问题，随时予以切实解决，及时传播好的经验。各省人民政府每五天应向东北人民政府汇报一次春耕生产情况。县、区、村应一律召开人民代表会议，着重讨论春耕生产的重要性和农业生产政策，动员各方面力量，开展春耕生产运动。为了将全部力量投入领导春耕，所有进行了“三反”运动的县，不论运动该不该结束，问题处理了或者还没有处理，都应一律暂时停止。县级机关干部已发现有贪污行为尚未处理者，只要不是情节严重的大贪污犯，都可令其在组织春耕中立功赎罪。县、区、村干部中，犯有贪污、浪费、官僚主义错误的，只要在领导生产中积极努力，做出成绩，一律从宽处理或免予处分；对消极怠工的，就要加重处分。村干部过去在土地改革中占小便宜，多拿斗争果实的，只要检讨错误，好好改正，一概不予追究。
    关于试办农业生产合作社问题，高岗指出：全区在去年秋收时约有一百个农业生产合作社，现在据不完全统计：已突增至一千二百多个。其中有些是根据农民的生产需要、思想觉悟程度、特别是有了比较丰富的合作互助经验，并有坚强的骨干领导组织起来的。这样的生产合作社，生产成绩不仅大大超过个体农民，也超过了一般互助组，因而获得了群众的拥护。但另外有很多农业生产合作社，不是根据上述条件组织起来的，而是单凭干部和少数积极分子的热情“轰”起来的，甚至是少数干部用强迫命令的办法强编起来的。这样的生产合作社，其结果很坏，在群众中造成了不良印象，为以后农业生产合作社的发展增加了困难。因此，应当引起各地领导方面注意：在组织农业生产合作社时，必须根据前述条件，并由县的领导方面直接掌握；一般每县今年只试办一两个。在北满合作互助基础较好的地区，具备了前述条件并有充分把握时，在区的直接掌握之下，每个区也可以试办一个（条件不具备而没有把握者，一概不要组织）。凡是这样组织起来的，都只准办好，不准办坏，以便作为典型示范，取得经验，到明年再加推广。各地凡是条件不成熟，或由干部以强迫命令办法组织起来的农业生产合作社，要说服干部和群众中的积极分子改组为各类形式的互助组。
    关于雇工、借贷、土地买卖和出租，以及互助合作中人马换工等问题，高岗指出：共产党和人民政府在政策上一般是允许雇工的。应当把共产党员不允许雇工和政策上一般允许雇工区别开来。雇工工资应按照各地区的情况决定，但不能太低。互助组和生产合作社内，原则上不允许雇工，但在农忙时节，为了生产需要，可允许雇短工和技术工人。为了活跃农村经济，应允许和提倡私人之间的正当借贷。借粮利息最高不得超过春借一斗、秋还斗半。借钱利息最高不得超过月息百分之三。超过上述规定者按高利贷论。为了打击高利贷，除国家银行和合作社应积极开展农村信贷业务外，同时必须说服党员、劳动模范、村干部和人民代表等贯彻上述利率的规定。土地买卖和出租必须适当加以限制。地主、旧富农以及不务正业企图逃避劳动生产者，一般不允许出卖和出租土地，必须强迫他们从事劳动，在劳动中加以改造，使他们自食其力。对正当的转业的如当医生、教员或入工厂做工者，不应限制；鳏寡孤独失去劳动力者也允许其土地出租。互助组和农业生产合作社，为了生产上的便利，准予租入或在农民自愿条件下调换土地。地租租额一般不得超过除去农业投资和交纳公粮后土地常年产量的百分之二十，鳏寡残废者可酌许提高。人工换马工必须等价两利。几年以内，东北全区就要推广使用马拉农具，因此必须繁殖马匹，必须使有马户有利可图，同时也不能使无马户吃亏。
    为了贯彻高岗主席的指示，东北人民政府已组成检查组，分赴各地检查春耕。各检查组分别由农业部部长杜者蘅、东北合作事业管理委员会主任委员阎顾行、民政部部长王一夫、东北人民政府办公厅主任王光伟等率领，在四月八日出发到吉林、辽东、辽西、黑龙江等省。检查组出发前，东北人民政府副主席林枫又给他们具体布置了工作。林枫指示他们到各省去要很好地把高岗主席的指示传达下去，贯彻到实际工作中去，并且要深入农村，切实了解春耕生产的情况，发现问题，解决问题。
