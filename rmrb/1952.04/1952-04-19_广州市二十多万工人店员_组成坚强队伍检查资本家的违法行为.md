Xinhua News Agency Report:

    In Guangzhou, more than 200,000 workers and shop assistants have formed a strong contingent, throwing themselves into the "Five-Anti" struggle. Workers and shop assistants in all trades and industries throughout the city have universally held conferences or representative meetings, where they wrote letters of determination, took oaths, and challenged each other, expressing their resolute will to carry out the struggle's tasks. At the same time, more than 6,000 people, including trade union cadres at all levels throughout the city and activists among workers and shop assistants in various trades and industries, formed worker work teams. They went to the designated 90 trades and industries to convey the significance, principles, and policies of the "Five-Anti" struggle to the workers and shop assistants of each factory and store, and to encourage them to participate in the struggle. Now, with the help of the work teams, the workers and shop assistants of most factories and stores have been organized.

    To help workers and shop assistants quickly raise their class consciousness and master policies, districts throughout the city have held study classes lasting about a week. More than 20,000 workers, shop assistants, and staff members have been trained. After studying "Who Feeds Whom," "The Future of the Working Class," and the principles and policies of the "Five-Anti" Movement, their fighting spirit became more vigorous, and a large number of new activists emerged. Many senior staff members also became active after training. In Yuexiu District, more than 270 senior staff members reported the fact that illegal capitalists had stolen 5.1 billion yuan of state property in the study class. In Taiping District, 300 senior staff members were approved to join the ranks.

    In recent days, thousands of large and small labor-capital meeting have been held in 90 industries. The worker masses brought their fighting power into full play, forcing many illegal capitalists to confess their illegal activities and bow their heads to the workers to admit their mistakes. In the construction industry, 187 households have made complete confessions. Shop assistants in the chemical raw materials industry uncovered the illegal facts of the capitalists in 44 households within four days. In the watch and clock industry, 84 capitalists also made complete confessions in the face of the workers' power. These industrial and commercial households that had made clear confessions at the labor-capital meeting were, with the consent of the workers and shop assistants, given lenient treatment by the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee and exempted from inspection.

    The ranks of workers and shop assistants are becoming more courageous and stronger as they fight. The number of core members of the construction industry workers has increased from 400 to 2,000 in the struggle, and they have successively reported more than 20,000 cases of illegal facts by illegal capitalists. Lin Guangren, a worker at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, led a group from his factory to other factories. They mastered the "five poisons" materials of illegal capitalists in five factories, including Tongfu and Weiye, and helped the workers in these factories force the capitalists to confess their crimes. The team led by Chen Xinshang forced 13 import and export merchants to confess their crimes and expanded the team from 16 to 50 people.

    Under the power of the mighty worker masses, some bosses who had only confessed to some "trivial matters" are now asking to supplement their confessions. Some, who had used methods such as pretending to be poor and refusing to pay wages to threaten the workers, also took out money to clear the arrears. Some capitalists, after making complete confessions and expressing their obedience to the leadership of the working class, expressed their determination to strive for meritorious service in exposing others to atone for their crimes.

    广州市二十多万工人店员
    组成坚强队伍检查资本家的违法行为
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：广州市二十多万工人、店员已组成了坚强的队伍，投入“五反”大斗争中。全市各行业的工人、店员们普遍地举行了大会或代表会议，他们在会上写下决心书，宣誓，互相挑战，表达了自己坚决执行斗争任务的意志。同时，全市各级工会干部和各行业工人店员中的积极分子共六千多人组成了工人工作队，他们分赴预定的九十个行业中，向各厂店工人店员传达“五反”斗争的意义和方针政策，推动他们参加斗争。现在大部分厂店的工人店员已在工作队的帮助下组织起来了。
    为帮助工人店员迅速提高阶级觉悟和掌握政策，全市各区纷纷举办为时一个星期左右的学习班。经过训练的工人、店员和职员已达两万多人。他们在学习了“谁养活谁”、“工人阶级的前途”和“五反”运动的方针政策后，斗争情绪更加旺盛，涌现出大批新的积极分子。许多高级职员经训练后也表现积极起来，越秀区有二百七十多个高级职员在学习班上检举了违法资本家盗窃国家财产共五十一亿元的事实。太平区有三百个高级职员被批准参加了队伍。
    连日来，九十个行业中举行了数以千计的大型或小型劳资见面会议。工人群众发挥斗争火力，迫使许多违法资本家坦白了违法行为，并向工人低头认错。营造业有一百八十七户已彻底坦白。化工原料业的店员在四天内就在四十四户中查明了资方的违法事实。钟表业也有八十四户资方在工人的威力面前彻底交代。这些在劳资见面会上交代清楚的工商户，经工人店员同意后，即获得市“五反”运动委员会的宽大处理，免予检查。
    工人店员的队伍愈战愈勇，愈战愈强。建筑业工人骨干分子在斗争中由四百人增至二千人，先后检举了违法资本家违法事实达二万多件。正泰胶厂工人林广仁率领的小组，由本厂战到别厂，他们掌握了同福、伟业等五家工厂的违法资本家的“五毒”材料，帮助这些工厂的工人迫使资本家坦白自己的罪行。陈欣尚领导的队伍，迫使十三家进出口商人坦白认罪，并把队伍从十六人扩大到五十人。
    在强大的工人群众的威力下，一部分只坦白了些“鸡毛蒜皮”的老板，现在纷纷要求补充坦白。有些曾用装穷抵赖不发工资等手段来威胁工人的，也拿钱出来清发欠薪了。有些资本家在彻底坦白和表示服从工人阶级领导后，表示决心争取检举立功折罪。
