    Introduction to da Vinci's Works
    ——On the two paintings "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa"
    Wu Zuoren
    Five hundred years ago, Leonardo da Vinci was born near the city of Florence in Italy. He was a poet, musician, biologist, physicist, military engineer, hydraulic engineer, architect, sculptor, and especially an outstanding painter. He was a genius of the Renaissance; he put a lot of effort into science and art, and made important contributions in both.
    Da Vinci's era was the era when the medieval feudal society in Italy was collapsing, and the newly acquired bourgeois class was initially forming; it was the era when science - despite the frenzied and tyrannical destruction of religion - was becoming increasingly prosperous; Da Vinci, in the anti-religious humanist torrent, treated fine arts like the study of scientific problems, thus obtaining unprecedentedly rich creativity.
    Because da Vinci's works had to go through long periods of management and exploration, most of his scarce works were unfinished. The works he completed were all extremely high artistic achievements. For example, in the two works "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa", he more completely embodied the spirit of his artistic research oriented to objective reality.
    "The Last Supper" is a painting depicting the legend of Jesus created by the people under the brutal rule of the Roman Empire. It depicts Jesus telling everyone during dinner with his twelve disciples that one of them would betray him.
    Before da Vinci, many painters, such as Giotto (1266-1336), Andrea del Castagno (1390-1457), and Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449-1498), had expressed the same theme. However, facing reality and with extraordinary observation, da Vinci was unwilling to bow down and follow established rules, using fictional scenes and deified characters to paint a religious painting without authenticity and even vulgarity. He did not adopt the emotionless line drawing method of early writers, nor did he imitate the decorative style popular in the Florentine school; what he wanted to achieve was to use what language to express the humanity of this story most realistically and reasonably.
    Da Vinci saw that these characters were not gods but humans, people with flesh and blood who had suffered oppression. They were simple, miserable and helpless, clinging to Jesus in despair. However, one of them had been bribed by the enemy to betray Jesus to the executioner. When they (the twelve disciples) heard Jesus' announcement, how panicked, angry, and uneasy they were. This is the scene that da Vinci wanted to deal with.
    There used to be a monk in Florence who specialized in painting paradise characters, so people called him Angelico
    (meaning "angel expert", 1387-1455). Before he started painting, he would kneel down and pray "to seek divine help". However, da Vinci, with his sketchbook in hand, walked to the place where people gathered - the big square or market in the city, seeking help from the poor people of the society at that time, and thus he obtained real images. He first wanted to write out the unique characteristics of the thirteen people. To write each different face and physique, showing their respective lives, and each person's different reaction to this shocking event; the main thing is to organize these chaotic emotions, connect them with each other, and respond to each other from near and far, so that this tragic scene can be unified in the complex.
    We see in this painting the young John on the right side of the main character Jesus, with his arms drooping and his body leaning, expressing unbearable grief and indignation. Jacob on the left side, with his arms open, leans forward in a lost shape. Philip (the third person on the left) puts his hands on his chest to show his innocence. …Everyone is reacting with anxiety, whispering to each other and asking questions in surprise, even Judas, who betrayed Jesus, is already afraid under the pressure of everyone's suspicion and investigation, although he has not been exposed, as if people know his crime. He turns to look back, trying to distance himself. But even hiding in the darkness cannot hide his treacherousness and inferiority. See him holding the shameful money bag, wanting to escape with the bribe. In this extremely sad and chaotic emotion, only Jesus is calm. Da Vinci strongly wrote out this contrast. Matching this are the excitement of the characters and the simple stability of the background buildings. Developing from the main characters in the central part to both sides, with three people as a group, the actions and emotions of each group of characters are closely linked, and the groups echo each other, and the entire movement is concentrated from both sides to the central part. In addition, the two walls and the ceiling and the long table are all simple straight lines, making the entire picture full of harmony in contradiction.
    "The Last Supper" is a rare masterpiece in the world, but it has suffered rare damage. This work was painted on the wall of the refectory of a monastery in Milan. Da Vinci boldly did new material experiments in the production of this mural. Unfortunately, this material was very fragile, and it began to peel off soon after it was completed. In 1652, ignorant monks cut a piece of the mural in order to expand the doorway, and the feet of the central figures in the picture were cut off. In 1726, another monk came, claiming to have mastered the secret of renovating old paintings, so he added a layer to the mural. In 1796, Napoleon's invading army occupied this ancient city and actually stationed in the monastery, using the refectory as a stable. The soldiers liked to throw small stones at the heads of the characters in this mural to compete for accuracy. After repeated tribulations, not much of "The Last Supper" can be passed down to this day. We can only vaguely ponder a little shadow of da Vinci's careful production in those years from the blurred picture.
    "Mona Lisa" was a native of Naples, born in 1479, and became the wife of the Florentine fur merchant Giocondo at the age of sixteen (so this painting is also called Gioconda, and some people call it "Smile"). This portrait is almost the most striking of European paintings. The moving legends about this portrait have attracted various audiences from all over the world for hundreds of years, especially after 1913 (the painting was stolen in 1911 and recovered in 1913). Da Vinci spent four years (1503-1506) to complete this portrait (of course not painting every day). He analyzed the structure of the face, studied the changes in light and shade; how to express the moistness of the skin and the trembling of life; the image and expression of the person are painted so completely and realistically, but da Vinci still felt unsatisfied.
    When da Vinci painted "Mona Lisa", although he was already a fifty-year-old writer with decades of work experience; but every time he faced a new object, he never flaunted his experience, but humbly exerted his scientific and sincere attitude. His realistic style made him not satisfied with superficial resemblance, but demanded constant new discoveries.
    Da Vinci did not think of a vague symbol, but gradually grasped the laws of movement, balance and contrast of things from in-depth observation, and he used this law to plan and deal with things. The reason why he became an outstanding writer of the Renaissance is because he was not limited to being as immersed in the imitation of classical cultural relics as the humanists of the time, but further invested in reality, enriched himself, and further armed his creativity.
    Some people like to render the process of da Vinci making this portrait magical and incredible. In fact, da Vinci was never a magician. He observed, analyzed, and synthesized the reflections of thoughts and the excitement of emotions without any negligence or implication; everything was clear and thorough, and everything had a scientific basis. If there is any secret, this is da Vinci's secret.
    In addition, da Vinci has several other works and thousands of drafts and sketches, which are collected in museums around the world (Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, Soviet Union, Louvre Museum in Paris, France, National Gallery in London, England, and Windsor Castle, as well as collection places in various cities in Italy). These works influenced the writers of da Vinci's time and his later generations. Such as Credi, del Sarto, Giorgione, even da Vinci's teacher Verrocchio, and the young writer Raphael, who was as famous as him, also absorbed his methods. He had cultivated some students, such as Beltraffio, Salai, etc., among whom Luini was the most famous, but he also vulgarized da Vinci's style the most. This influence spread in Europe until centuries later. However, this is only to appreciate and imitate the forms created by da Vinci, and did not explore how da Vinci created, so "vulgarization" is inevitable.
    Da Vinci despised religion because religion and scientific truth are incompatible. During his time in the Vatican in Rome, the church regarded his scientific experiments as witchcraft, and he soon left. He stood at the forefront of the Renaissance. Although he felt lonely, he opened up new paths for countless people behind him and gave great inspiration to modern culture. His achievements are not only Italian but already a valuable asset of mankind.
    Da Vinci's work - whether scientific research or artistic creation - is for building the happy future of mankind, which can be proved from his ideals and practice. At a time when American imperialism is attempting to destroy the excellent culture and peaceful life of mankind with barbaric aggressive wars, it is of great significance for us to commemorate the 500th anniversary of da Vinci's birth for our ongoing work of defending culture and defending peace.

    芬奇的作品介绍
    ——关于“最后的晚餐”和“蒙娜丽莎”两幅画　吴作人
    五百年前在意大利佛罗仑斯城附近，诞生了辽奥纳多·达·芬奇。他是诗人，音乐家，生物学家，物理学家，军事工程师，水利工程师，建筑家，雕刻家，尤其是杰出的画家。他是文艺复兴时期的奇才；在科学和艺术各方面，都下了很大的功夫，并且都有重要的贡献。
    芬奇的年代，正是意大利在中世纪封建社会已趋崩溃的，新攫得政权的资产阶级初步形成的年代；是科学——尽管受宗教的疯狂暴虐的摧残——日益昌明起来的年代；芬奇就是在反宗教的人文主义的激流里，如同对科学问题的钻研一样对待美术，因而获得了空前的丰富的创造。
    由于芬奇的作品都要经过长时期的经营和探求，以致在他的稀少的作品中间，还有大半是未完成的。他所完成的作品都是极高的艺术成果。如在“最后的晚餐”和“蒙娜丽莎”两幅作品里，都是比较完整地体现了他在艺术上所进行的面向客观实际的钻研的精神。
    “最后的晚餐”是描写罗马帝国残暴统治下，民间所创造的耶稣的传说故事的一幅画。它描写着耶稣在和十二个门徒一起晚餐的时候，告诉大家说，在他们中间有一个人出卖了他。
    在芬奇之前已经有过好多画家，如乔陀（1266—1336），安得列亚·迨尔·加斯大尼阿（1390—1457），狄·吉尔郎达育（1449—1498）等，都表现过这同样的题材了。但是面对现实，观察力过人的芬奇绝不肯低首下心地，遵循既成的规矩，采用虚构的情景，神化的人物来画成一幅没有真实性以至庸俗的宗教画。他不采取早期作家的缺少感情的边线勾勒法，也不仿效佛罗棱画派所流行的装饰风格；他所想要做到的，就是用什么语言来把这个故事的人间性说得最真实，最入情入理。
    芬奇看到了这些角色不是神而是人，是有骨有肉的，受尽压迫的人。他们是单纯的，悲惨无告的，在绝望中攀着了耶稣。可是，他们自己中间的一个，竟受了敌人的贿赂，把耶稣出卖给刽子手了。当他们（十二门徒）听到了耶稣的宣告，他们是如何地惊慌失措，忿怒和不安。这些，就是芬奇所要处理的场景了。
    从前佛罗仑斯城有一个修士，专画一些天堂人物因此人家就叫他安藉理珂
    （意即“天使专家”，1387—1455）。他的作画，在未动笔之前，先就跪下来做祷告，“以求神助”。可是芬奇，他挟起画本，走上人民聚集的地方——市区里的大广场或市集，求助于当时社会的贫苦人民，他于是获得了真实的形象。他首先要写出十三个人的独具的特性。写每个不同的面貌和体魄，显示着他们各别的生命，和每个人对于这个惊人的事件的不同的反应；更主要的就是要把这些纷乱的情绪组织起来，彼此有联系，远近有呼应，使得这一幕悲剧的场面在综错中得到统一。
    我们看这画上主题人物耶稣右侧的年青的约翰，两臂垂着，身子倾斜着，不胜悲忿的神情。左侧的雅各，两臂张着，欠身作失措的形状。腓利（左侧第三人）两手扪胸，以明心迹。……每个人都反应着惶惶不安，在交头接耳惊相问探的时候，就是那出卖耶稣的犹大，在大家怀疑和追究的压力下，虽然还没有被揭发，而他自己已经畏惧起来，像是人家知道了他的罪行了。他回身向后看，想把自己置身事外。但是尽管躲避在阴暗里也隐藏不住他的险诈卑劣。看他手握着那可耻的钱包，想带着贿赂逃走。在这极度怆惶散乱的情绪中，只有耶稣是神色沉静。芬奇强烈地写出这个对照。和这个相配合着的还有人物的激动，和背景建筑物的简单稳定。由中央部分的主题人物向两边发展，以三个人为一组，每组人物的动作和情感是紧密连系着，组和组之间彼此呼应，而整个的运动又是从两边向中央部分集中。加上两壁和顶板以及长台，都是单纯的直线，使全部画面充满了矛盾中的和谐。
    “最后的晚餐”是一幅世界稀有的杰作，但它遭到了稀有的损害。这幅作品是画在米兰的一个修道院的餐堂的墙壁上。芬奇在这幅壁画的制作上，大胆地做了新的材料试验，不幸这种材料是很不坚固，画成了不久就开始剥落了。加上在一六五二年，无知的僧徒，为了要扩大门洞，就把壁画挖了一块，画面中央人物的足部就给割去了。一七二六年，又来了一个和尚，自称掌握了旧画翻新的秘诀，于是把壁画上面加涂了一层。到了一七九六年，拿破仑的侵略军进占了这个古城，竟驻入修道院，把餐堂做了马厩。士卒们最喜欢对着这壁画上的人物的头部抛掷小石块来竞赛命中力。经过了屡次磨难，“最后的晚餐”能留传到今天的也没有多少了。我们只能从模糊不清的画面上，依稀琢磨一点芬奇当年的精心制作的影子。
    “蒙娜丽莎”是那波里人，生于一四七九年，十六岁就做了佛罗仑斯的皮货商觉贡多的妻子（因此这幅画也称做觉贡达，也有人称它做“微笑”）。这幅画像，几乎是欧洲绘画中间最令人注意的一幅。关于这幅画像的一些动人的传说，吸引着几百年来尤其是在一九一三年以后（该画曾在一九一一年被窃走，后于一九一三年找回）世界各处的各种各样的观众。芬奇以四年的光阴（一五零三—一五零六）完成了这幅画像（当然不是每天画）。他分析面部的结构，研究明暗的变幻；如何表现肌肤的泽润，生命的动颤；把人的形象和神态，这样完整地、现实地画出来了，可是芬奇还认为不满足。
    当芬奇画“蒙娜丽莎”的时候，虽然已经是具有几十年的工作经验的五十岁的老作家了；可是当他每次在新的对象面前，他决不卖弄他的经验，而虚心地发挥他科学的诚恳的态度。他的现实的作风使他不会以外表的形似为满足，而要求不断地有新的发现。
    芬奇不去想一个缥缈的象征，他从深入的观察中渐渐掌握着事物的运动、平衡和对照的规律，他又根据这个规律来策动和处理事物。他之所以成为文艺复兴期的杰出的作家，乃是因为他不限于像当时的人文主义者那样仅沉醉于对古典文物的模仿，而更进一步投入现实，丰富了自己，更进一步地武装了自己的创造力。
    有些人喜欢把芬奇制作这幅画像的过程渲染得神奇不可思议。其实芬奇从来不是什么魔术家。他观察、分析、综合思想的反映和情感的激动，没有一点疏忽，也不用一点暗示；一切都是明朗彻底的，一切都有科学的依据。假如说有什么秘诀，这便是芬奇的秘诀了。
    此外芬奇还有几件作品和数以千计的画稿和素描，分藏在世界各国的博物馆里（苏联列宁格勒隐修院博物馆，法国巴黎鲁弗尔博物院，英国伦敦国家美术馆和温莎宫，以及意大利各城的收藏处所）这些作品影响了和芬奇同时代的作家和他的后辈。如克莱第，迨尔·萨尔多，觉尔觉纳，甚至芬奇的老师维洛齐阿，还有和他齐名的年青作家拉斐尔也在吸收他的方法。他曾培养了一些学生，如贝尔特拉斐阿、梭拉李阿等，其中以鲁依尼最享盛名，可是把芬奇的风格最庸俗化了的也是他。这种影响在欧洲流传，一直到几个世纪以后。但是，这仅是欣赏和模仿芬奇所创造的形式，并没有探讨芬奇如何在创造，于是“庸俗化”是不可避免的。
    芬奇鄙视宗教，因为宗教和科学真理是不两立的。他在罗马梵蒂冈的时期，教会把他的科学实验看做妖术，他很快就离开了。他站在文艺复兴的最前哨，他虽然感到孤寂，但他给无数在他后面的人开拓了新的道路，给近代文化以极大的启发。他的成就，不仅是意大利的而已经是人类的宝贵财富。
    芬奇的工作——无论科学研究或艺术创作，都是为了建设人类幸福的将来，这从他的理想和实践中可以得到证明的。正当美帝国主义以野蛮的侵略战争，企图毁灭人类的优秀文化、和平生活的今天，我们来纪念芬奇的诞生五百周年，这对于我们在进行着的保卫文化、保卫和平的工作，是有着重大意义的。（附图片）
