Under the Direction of US-British Imperialism
The Egyptian Government Intensifies its Reign of Terror

[This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: Hilar, who became the Prime Minister of Egypt on March 2nd, has, with the authorization and support of the US-British imperialists, taken a series of terror measures in the past month and a half to eliminate dissidents, persecute patriotic youths, and suppress the Egyptian national liberation movement, in order to clear the way for open compromise with the US-British imperialists.

On March 2, the Hilar government closed Egypt's largest university, Farouk University, to suppress the patriotic movement of students at the school who were staging a sit-down strike to protest the government's continued martial law and the signing of any agreement with Western countries. On March 17 and 18, the Hilar government, on the pretext of being responsible for the "Cairo Riot" on January 26, sentenced Socialist Party leader Ahmed Hussein to 18 months in prison, and arrested former Minister of the Interior and Finance and Wafd Party Secretary-General Siraj al-Din and former Minister of Social Affairs Hassan. Then, on March 20, 23, and 26, the Hilar government again used the "crime" of participating in the "arson incident" on January 26, which was actually done by British agents, to sentence thirteen patriots to prison terms ranging from three to seven years, and on March 29, dispatched 180 officers and soldiers to conduct house-to-house searches in Cairo, arresting 195 people. Hilar has authorized Interior Minister Malaji to arbitrarily arrest and detain anyone.

While implementing these terror measures, Hilar actively excluded the Wafd Party, which had a strong presence in parliament. On March 23, after Egyptian King Farouk ordered the dissolution of the lower house of parliament, where Wafd Party members held a majority of seats, the Hilar cabinet announced that a general election would be held on May 18, and the new parliament would convene on May 31. However, on April 12, the Hilar government again used the pretext of amending the election law to postpone the election date indefinitely.

The Hilar government's reactionary measures have been actively supported and praised by US imperialism. An Associated Press dispatch from Cairo on March 19 revealed: It is said that the United States has expressed to Hilar that his "reform program" has received the "moral support" of the United States.

At the same time, the United States' conspiracies in Egypt have also been increasing. The aforementioned Associated Press dispatch said: "Political observers here say that the United States' activities in the entire region, which were once almost entirely within the British sphere of influence, are now strengthening to the point of making close contact with the Islamic government every day, which was previously unexpected." According to the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram," US Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, has used all his strength to reconcile the opinions of Egypt and Britain in order to pull Egypt into the Middle East "defense system." Under the active instigation of US imperialism, according to a dispatch from International News Service in Washington on the 9th, Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Rahim, recently stated publicly in a speech at Duke University in North Carolina that if Britain first withdraws its troops stationed in the Suez Canal area and agrees to concessions on the Sudan issue, then the Egyptian government would be willing to join the "Middle East Command."

The further intrusion of US imperialist forces into Egypt has made the contradictions between the US and Britain in their struggle for hegemony in the Middle East increasingly apparent. According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo on the 7th, US Ambassador Caffery himself could not help but admit: "News from London says my efforts are 'excessive.'" According to the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Misri," "According to reliable sources, Britain has planned to have Hilar and Eden hold direct negotiations, so that the United States has no chance to plan or interfere. It is said that the US Ambassador's planning has 'angered Britain.'"

    在美英帝国主义的指使下
    埃及政府加紧实行恐怖统治
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在三月二日出任埃及首相的希拉里，在美英帝国主义者的授意与支持下，一个半月来采取了一连串的排除异己分子、迫害爱国青年、镇压埃及民族解放运动的恐怖措施，以便为与美英帝国主义者公开妥协扫清道路。
    三月二日，希拉里政府封闭了埃及最大的大学法德大学，以镇压该校学生为抗议政府继续戒严以及和西方国家签订任何协定而实行静坐罢课的爱国运动。在三月十七日、十八日，希拉里政府以所谓应对一月二十六日“开罗暴动”负责的“罪名”，把社会党领袖艾哈迈德·侯赛尼判处十八个月徒刑，并逮捕了前内政大臣兼财政大臣、华夫脱党总书记锡拉吉丁和前社会事务大臣哈森。接着，在三月二十日、二十三日、二十六日，希拉里政府又用参加一月二十六日的实际上是英国特务干的“纵火事件”的“罪名”，把十三个爱国人士分别判处了三年至七年的徒刑，并在三月二十九日出动一百八十名官兵在开罗实行逐屋搜查，逮捕了一百九十五人。希拉里已授权内政大臣马拉吉可任意逮捕和拘禁任何人。
    与实行这些恐怖措施同时，希拉里积极排斥在议会中的拥有强大势力的华夫脱党。三月二十三日，在埃及国王法鲁克下令解散华夫脱党议员占多数席位的下议院以后，希拉里内阁宣布将在五月十八日举行大选，新议会在五月三十一日召开。但在四月十二日，希拉里政府又利用修改选举法为藉口，把选举日期予以无限期地延长。
    希拉里政府的反动措施受到美帝国主义积极的支持和赞扬。合众社开罗三月十九日的消息透露：据说美国已向希拉里表示，他的“改革纲领”受到美国“道义上的支持”。
    与此同时，美国在埃及的阴谋活动也已日益加强。上述合众社的消息说：“此间的政治观察家说，美国在整个区域内的活动，一度几乎完全在英国的势力范围之内，目前的活动则加强到每日和回教政府进行密切接触的地步，这是以前预料不到的。”据埃及报纸“金字塔报”称，美国驻埃及大使加佛利用尽了一切力量来使埃及和英国的意见趋于协调，以便把埃及拉进中东的“防御体系”。在美帝国主义的积极策动下，据国际新闻社华盛顿九日电透露，埃及驻美大使拉希姆最近在美国北卡罗来纳州杜克大学演说时，已经公开表示：如果英国首先撤退驻在苏彝士运河区的军队并同意在苏丹问题上让步，那么埃及政府就愿意参加“中东司令部”。
    美帝国主义势力进一步侵入埃及，使英美之间在争夺中东霸权上的矛盾日益表面化。据路透社开罗七日电，美国大使加佛利自己都不能不承认：“伦敦的消息说我的努力‘过火’。”另据埃及报纸“埃及人报”称：“据可靠方面消息，英国已计划由希拉里与艾登直接举行谈判，使美国没有机会进行策划或干涉。据说美国大使的策划已经‘触怒了英国’。”
