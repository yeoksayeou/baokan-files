    Saluting Our Worker Brothers and Sisters Who Fully Support Us
    By Xia Guang, Returning Delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    "Take our hearts that love the Volunteer Army to the Korean front!" Since returning to the motherland, we have heard countless exhortations like this from our worker brothers and sisters. Everywhere we go, we receive their love for the Volunteer Army. In Shanghai, when Commander Li Xuesan gave a broadcast report, continuous calls came from various factories and workshops, with thousands upon thousands of workers expressing their respect for the Volunteer Army. The crew of the Xin Kang steamer heard our broadcast while sailing at sea and immediately sent a telegram to pay tribute to the Volunteer Army, and donated 2.5 million yuan on the spot to慰劳 the frontline Volunteer Army troops. In Hangzhou, a letter from the employees of the Pinghu Shuang Automobile Company read: "Because you are the most beloved people protecting us, whatever you need, just tell us, we can do it. If you need drivers, we have them! If you need people to repair vehicles, we have them! If you need transportation personnel, we have them! We are fully prepared, waiting for your needs and the call of the motherland."

    We visited several factories and deeply realized that the struggle to Resist America, Aid Korea is being carried out in every workshop and construction site. On the walls and machines of the factories, there are posted covenants for launching patriotic production increase competitions and slogans supporting the Volunteer Army. The workers are working as nervously as if they were fighting on the front lines. New records appear frequently, and new model deeds are frequently posted on the bulletin boards.

    At a railway factory in Qingdao, Ding Juqi, the chairman of the factory's trade union, happily told us that thanks to the promotion of advanced experience and the launch of a patriotic production increase competition, all the employees of the factory had completed the production tasks for the first quarter of this year ahead of schedule. The workers have created many miracles in production. For example, when repairing a batch of flatcars supporting the Korean front, the higher authorities stipulated that one car should be repaired every three days, but they repaired and delivered one car in one day. Zheng Shihun's team in the mechanical workshop increased the production of new cylinders from four to nine per month. By the end of March, all the employees of the factory had put forward 384 rationalization proposals. All machine workshops have overfulfilled their production tasks, saving the country 3.956 billion yuan.

    In the fine yarn workshop of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, we met Hao Jianxiu, a nationally renowned textile labor model. With an excited smile on her face, she said to us: "The workers of Qingdao City donated six fighter planes last year to support you. Now, everyone is racking their brains to find ways to improve technology and produce more finished products to support you." Then she told us that the workers in the fine yarn workshop had increased their ability to look after machines from 400 spindles to 800 spindles; the rate of roller laps had been repeatedly reduced. Zhang Shugong, who set a national record, has maintained a record of only about 0.072 percent of roller laps for several months. Before leaving, Hao Jianxiu said with certainty: "Now all the workers are looking for窍门 to increase production and practice economy. We have decided to increase the country's wealth by 9.3 billion yuan this year."

    In Guangzhou, Wang Shengbao, a national industrial labor model, repaired a turbine on a generator worth 8.8 billion yuan. We also met Kong Xianzong, a steelmaking expert from a machinery factory. He used his intelligence to successfully smelt high-manganese steel. This steel is an important raw material for the machinery industry, and in the past, it was mostly imported from abroad. He said straightforwardly to us: "We are workers of Chairman Mao, and we have ways to create everything."

    During our return to the country, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were being carried out vigorously. Workers across the country heroically stood at the forefront of this movement. In Tianjin City alone, store employees and workers reported 84,000 cases of illegal activities by capitalists, and uncovered 1,028 illegal capitalists who had stolen more than 100 million yuan of national wealth, including 48 with more than 5 billion yuan. After this great struggle, we have now seen a new atmosphere in the motherland.

    The spirit of the worker brothers and sisters loving the motherland, loving Chairman Mao, and loving the Volunteer Army, educates us everywhere and motivates us to fight the American aggressors more heroically. I remember when we visited a mechanical factory in Shanghai with representatives of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Comrade Jiang Xiangji, a representative of the Korean People's Delegation to China—the chairman of a factory trade union in Korea—suddenly embraced the machine and kissed it, and then tightly embraced our worker comrades, with glistening tears in his eyes, and said excitedly: "You have such good factories, you create a lot of wealth for the country, it's so wonderful! Our factories in Korea have been destroyed by the American bandits. We will fight it!" Yes, the Korean people are fighting it, and we, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, will never allow it to continue to invade Korea and attack our country. To defend the great motherland, to defend the worker brothers and sisters who love us, and to defend our beautiful factories, we must fight more heroically and more resolutely!

    The great May Day is coming. We would like to pay tribute to the worker brothers and sisters who are working hard for the motherland!

    向全力支援我们的工人兄弟姊妹们致敬
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  夏光
    “把我们这一颗热爱志愿军的心，带到朝鲜前线去吧！”回到祖国以后，我们听到了祖国的工人兄弟姊妹们无数次地这样嘱咐我们。我们到处接受着他们对志愿军的热爱。在上海，当李雪三团长作广播报告时，连续不断的电话来自各个工厂、车间，上千上万工人同志向志愿军表示敬意。新康轮船的职工在海上航行中收听了我们的广播，马上打电报来向志愿军致敬，并当场捐款二百五十万元来慰劳前线志愿军部队。在杭州，萍湖双汽车公司职工寄来的一封信里写着：“因为你们是保卫我们的最可爱的人，你们需要什么，尽管对我们说，我们都能办到。要驾驶汽车的人，我们有！要修理车子的人，我们有！要运输人员，我们有！我们全力准备着，等待你们的需要和祖国的召唤。”
    我们访问了几处工厂，我们深深地体会到抗美援朝的斗争是在每一个车间、工地里进行着。工厂的墙上，机器上，贴着开展爱国增产竞赛的公约和支援志愿军的标语，工人们如同在火线上作战一样紧张地工作着。时常有新纪录出现，时常有新的模范事迹登上黑板报。
    在青岛某铁路工厂，厂里的工会主席丁菊畦欣喜地告诉我们，全厂职工由于推广先进经验和开展爱国增产竞赛，已经提前完成了今年第一季度的生产任务。工人们在生产中创造了许多的奇迹。例如在检修支援朝鲜前线的一批平板车时，上级规定三天修一辆，他们一天工夫就修好出厂。机械场郑世勋小组做新汽缸，从每月做四个提高到九个。到三月底止，全厂职工提出了合理化建议三百八十四件。各机器工场都超额完成了生产任务，给国家节省了三十九亿五千六百多万元。
    在青岛国棉六厂的细纱间里，我们会见了全国闻名的纺织劳动模范郝建秀。她脸上挂着兴奋的笑容，对我们说：“青岛市工人为了支援你们，去年下半年捐了六架战斗机。现在，大家又在开动脑筋，想办法提高技术，多出成品来支援你们。”接着她告诉我们，细纱间工人的看车能力已由四百锭提高到八百锭；皮辊花率一再降低。创全国纪录的张淑宫，好几个月来一直保持着只出皮辊花百分之零点零七二左右的纪录。临走的时候，郝建秀有把握地说：“现在全体工友都在找窍门来增产节约，我们决定在今年给国家增加九十三亿元的财富。”
    在广州，全国工业劳动模范王生保修好了一部发电机上的价值八十八亿元的透平机。我们也会见了某机械厂的炼钢能手孔宪忠。他发挥自己的智慧，成功地炼成了高锰钢。这种钢是机械工业上的重要原料，过去大都是从国外输入的。他豪爽地对我们说：“我们是毛主席的工人，有办法创造一切。”
    在我们回国期间，正是“三反”和“五反”运动轰轰烈烈地开展的时候。全国工人英勇地站在这一运动的前线。仅天津市的店员工人就检举了资本家的违法行为八万四千件，查出了盗窃国家财富一亿元以上的不法资本家一千零二十八人，其中五十亿元以上的有四十八个。经过这次伟大的斗争，我们现在已经看到了祖国的一片新气象。
    工人兄弟姊妹们热爱祖国、热爱毛主席、热爱志愿军的精神，处处教育着我们，激励我们更英勇地去和美国侵略者作战。我记得我们在上海和朝鲜人民访华代表团代表一道去访问某机械工厂时，朝鲜人民访华团代表姜相基同志——朝鲜某工厂的工会主席——突然抱着机器亲吻，然后又紧紧地抱住我们的工人同志，两眼含着晶莹的热泪，激动地说：“你们有这样好的工厂，你们为国家大量地创造财富，真是太幸福了！我们朝鲜的工厂，被美国强盗破坏了。我们要和它拼！”是的，朝鲜人民在和它拼，我们中国人民志愿军也绝不允许它继续侵犯朝鲜，进攻我国。为了保卫伟大的祖国，保卫热爱我们的工人兄弟姊妹，保卫我们美好的工厂，我们要更英勇、更坚强地战斗！
    伟大的五一劳动节来了，我们谨向为祖国努力生产的工人兄弟姐妹们致敬！
