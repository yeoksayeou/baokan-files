Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: The Greek royalist fascist regime, under the orders of its American masters, brazenly murdered the heroic and unyielding fighter for peace and democracy, Beloyannis, a member of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, and his three comrades on March 31st. This heinous crime by the Greek royalist fascists has aroused the boundless anger of the Greek people and the people of the world.

For a long time, with the personal involvement of the American ambassador to Athens in the planning, the Greek royalist fascists have been painstakingly plotting this murder. As early as December 1950, the Greek secret police arrested Beloyannis. On November 16th of last year, in the so-called "Trial of Ninety-Three," which specifically persecuted Greek patriots, the Athens authorities fabricated the charge of "engaging in subversive activities" and sentenced Beloyannis and others to death, but dared not carry it out due to the pressure of world opinion. On March 1st of this year, the Athens military court, in the so-called "Trial of Twenty-Nine," again sentenced them to death on the shamelessly fabricated charge of "espionage," and announced that it would be carried out within three days of the verdict. However, the massive protest movement launched by the Greek people and the progressive forces of the world, led by the Soviet Union, once again forced the Greek authorities to postpone the execution. However, the Americans and their Greek lackeys were not willing to give up their sinister plot. They did not hesitate to antagonize the people of the world and finally ordered the so-called "Pardon Committee" in Athens to reject the appeals of Beloyannis and his comrades, thus realizing their bloody murder.

After the news of the murder of the Greek people's hero, Beloyannis, spread, the movement to protest the murder of Beloyannis by the Americans and Greek royalist fascists spread like wildfire in Greece and around the world. In Greek cities and villages, prisons and concentration camps, the people expressed their protests through action. The members of the Left Democratic Alliance in the Greek Parliament have lodged a protest with the Speaker. Greek patriots exiled in the people's democratic countries pledged to fight for the complete victory of the Greek people under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party. The Central Committees of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania sent telegrams to the Greek Communist Party to express their condolences for the death of Beloyannis. The people of Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic held rallies, pledging to strengthen the forces of the peace camp in response to the provocation of the Greek and world peace and democratic forces by the Americans and Greek royalist fascists. The British and French Communist Parties have issued declarations condemning this new atrocity and calling on the people to strengthen the struggle against American imperialism. The Israeli Communist Party's organ, "People's Voice," denounced this heinous murder. Mrs. Felton, Picasso, and other British and French celebrities have issued protests. The working people of Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Trieste, and Cyprus have gone on strike, held rallies, staged demonstrations, or issued statements to protest the atrocities of the Greek authorities.

    希腊反动派竟不顾世界人民的反对
    悍然杀害贝劳扬尼斯
    全世界展开抗议运动
    【新华社五日讯】三月三十一日，希腊保皇法西斯政权在美国主子的命令下，悍然杀害了英勇不屈的和平民主战士、希腊共产党中央委员会委员贝劳扬尼斯和他的三个同志。希腊保皇法西斯分子这种凶恶的暴行，激起了希腊人民和全世界人民的无比愤怒。
    长久以来，在美国驻雅典大使亲身参与策划下，希腊保皇法西斯分子一直在处心积虑地布置这次谋杀。早在一九五○年十二月，希腊秘密警察就逮捕了贝劳扬尼斯。去年十一月十六日，雅典当局就在专门迫害希腊爱国者的所谓“九十三人审讯案”中，伪造所谓“从事颠覆活动”的罪名，判处贝劳扬尼斯等以死刑，但是由于全世界舆论的压力而未敢执行。今年三月一日，雅典军事法庭又在所谓“二十九人审讯案”中，以无耻捏造的“间谍”罪名，再次把他们判处死刑，并宣布要在判决后三天内执行。但是，希腊人民和以苏联为首的全世界进步力量所发动的声势浩大的抗议运动，又一次迫使希腊当局不得不暂缓执刑。然而，美国人及其希腊走狗们并不甘心放弃他们的罪恶阴谋，他们不惜与全世界人民为敌，终于命令雅典的所谓“特赦委员会”驳回了贝劳扬尼斯和他的同志们的上诉，实现了对他们血腥的谋杀。
    希腊人民英雄贝劳扬尼斯遇害的消息传出后，抗议美国人和希腊保皇法西斯分子杀害贝劳扬尼斯的运动，像燎原烈火一般在希腊以及全世界各地扩展。在希腊各城市和乡村、牢狱和集中营，人民都以行动来表示抗议。希腊议会中的左翼民主联盟的议员已向议长提出抗议。流亡在人民民主国家的希腊爱国者保证在希腊共产党领导下为争取希腊人民的彻底胜利而奋斗。捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和罗马尼亚的共产党和工人党中央委员会都打电报给希腊共产党，吊唁贝劳扬尼斯的遇害。保加利亚、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的人民都举行集会，保证努力加强和平阵营的力量，来回答美国人和希腊保皇法西斯分子对希腊和全世界和平民主力量的挑衅。英国和法国共产党都发表宣言，谴责这种新的暴行，并且号召人民加强反对美帝国主义的斗争。以色列共产党机关报“人民呼声报”痛斥这种罪恶的谋杀。费尔顿夫人、毕加索及其他英国、法国的社会名流都发出抗议。英国、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、奥地利、的里雅斯特和塞浦路斯岛的劳动人民纷纷停工集会，或举行示威游行，或发表声明，抗议希腊当局的暴行。
