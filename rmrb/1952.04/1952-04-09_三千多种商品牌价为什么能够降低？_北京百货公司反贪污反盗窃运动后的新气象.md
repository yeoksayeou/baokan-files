    Why Can Over Three Thousand Commodity Prices Be Reduced?
    -- New Atmosphere in Beijing Department Store After the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Theft Movement
    He Bingran

    Following the reduction of prices for over five hundred commodities on March 30th, the Beijing Branch of the China Department Store Corporation further lowered the prices of over three thousand three hundred Shanghai commodities on April 1st. The first reduction saw a maximum decrease of 20% and an average decrease of 5%. The second reduction saw a maximum decrease of 34.95% and an average decrease of 7.5%. The broad masses of citizens deeply welcomed this event. This is an achievement resulting from the anti-corruption, anti-theft movement, which allows everyone to further recognize the greatness and correctness of the anti-corruption, anti-theft movement.

    In the past two or three years, the Beijing Department Store Company has also suffered from the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. Many cadres were dragged into the water and degenerated into agents of the bourgeoisie, directly causing serious damage to state assets and the people's livelihood. Now, that handful of "agents" have all been purged; the vast majority of staff members, after being tempered by this movement, have continuously improved their political awareness and professional skills. They have deeply realized the importance of their responsibilities in directly affecting the people's livelihood, thereby demonstrating a high degree of responsibility to the people. The systems for business and work have also been initially improved. Especially in dealings with private manufacturers for processing orders and purchasing goods, they have begun to closely rely on the working class and strive to conduct in-depth investigations and research, and accurately calculate the production costs of goods. This approach not only exposed the cunning tricks of unscrupulous merchants who consistently inflated costs, but also improved the quality of finished products due to careful inventory checks. This is the fundamental reason why commodity prices have been reduced recently.

    In the past two years, the Beijing Department Store Company has fulfilled its responsibility in stabilizing prices and supplying the daily necessities of the broad masses of people. This can be seen from the fact that the company's stores are often crowded with customers and its business is thriving. At the same time, it has also done a lot of work to support the production of more than 180 towel factories, more than 70 sock factories, more than 60 garment factories, and more than 30 shoe factories in Beijing. However, in the process of such support, many profit-seeking and self-serving illegal manufacturers repaid kindness with ingratitude and launched a rampant attack on the department store. The department store's sales mainly consist of socks, towels, clothing, and shoes. These goods were subjected to the rampant theft of unscrupulous merchants in the process of processing, purchasing, and exchange. The main method used by unscrupulous merchants to commit theft was to collude with internal staff members of the company, turning them into their agents and mouthpieces, and then inflate costs and cut corners. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the company's work on calculating the cost of processing orders was only understood by a few business group leaders, and most of the staff members were laymen. As a result, they were deceived by a major corrupt element who manipulated everything single-handedly. Therefore, when signing contracts with private merchants, the corrupt element would always be obedient and follow orders, no matter what the private merchants said or how much they wanted. When delivering goods, they were even more careless, regardless of the details and blindly accepting the goods. For example, in the winter of 1951, when the company processed woolen sweaters for the first joint group of the knitting industry, each bundle of cotton yarn could yield 106 taels of finished products the first time. However, the second time the cotton yarn they were given was much better than the first time, but the finished products delivered were reduced to 103 taels. On the contrary, the processing fee was greatly increased. Under such circumstances, the receiver did not mention a word. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the bad elements in the company were purged, and the sense of responsibility of the general staff members was improved. They began to change the past phenomenon of "having no idea" and the work style of working blindly. Especially in calculating production costs, they strived to conduct in-depth investigations and research, and carefully calculate. Before each time the company negotiated with private merchants to determine the cost, it always sent people to the factory to understand the labor and expenditure items involved in the production process by relying on the trade union and active members of the workers, and conduct detailed research to obtain a cost price that was closer to the actual situation. This made it possible to have a clear idea beforehand. With this favorable condition, when negotiating with private merchants and appropriately taking care of their legitimate profits, private merchants had to admit that it was reasonable and were willing to modify their own excessively calculated costs. Some capitalists even asked in surprise: "How can you understand it so clearly! We should really learn from you." In this way, not only was the effect of cost reduction achieved, but the quality of finished products was also guaranteed. For example, the contract that the company had previously signed with the private Yizhong Sock Factory regarding 20-count knitted floral ribbed socks stipulated that each bundle of 20-count cotton yarn would be exchanged for 7 dozen and 6 pairs of finished products, and 128 catties of processed rice; while now, when re-signing the contract, the exchange for finished products has increased to 7 dozen and 9 pairs, and the processed rice has been reduced to 101 catties. In this way, the factory can still obtain a net profit of 5% to 10%. The processing fee for clothing has also been reduced by an average of 5% to 10% compared with the past, and it is stipulated that the number of stitches per unit length should be consistent. The processing fee for each pair of leather shoes is now about 20,000 yuan cheaper than in the past, and the workmanship is required to be more solid than in the past. In addition, there has also been a great change in the distribution of materials. In the past, the company would send whole bolts of cloth and bundles of leather to private merchants, allowing them to cut materials and even replace materials themselves. Now the company has hired its own workers to cut materials. This can not only plug loopholes, but also leave a large number of scraps of cloth and leather, which can be sold as by-products (scraps of clothing can be sold for 1,500 yuan per catty), and the income is not small. In the past, these were all batches of materials left in the hands of private merchants.

    In the past, in order to support the production of some small and medium-sized industries in Beijing, the department store company had launched a sales business (i.e., selling goods on behalf of private merchants and only taking handling fees). However, unscrupulous merchants were ungrateful and took advantage of the sales loophole. Their method was to cut corners on the goods that the company entrusted them to process, and not deliver the goods according to the original specifications. The uniforms were either made too short in the upper body, or the trouser legs were made too small in the lower body, or the collar was too tight, or the cuffs were missing a section. However, the merchants made their own consignment goods in accordance with the specifications and the style was good. In this way, the consignment goods were sold at a higher price than the company's goods, and the company's goods could not be sold. The department store almost became a store for private merchants to sell goods. For this reason, the price of goods was raised invisibly, which damaged the people's purchasing power. At present, the company has clearly stipulated that, except for special technical goods that are needed by the broad masses of people, all other sales businesses will, in principle, be stopped. This makes it possible for the company's goods to be supplied to the citizens at low prices according to the business plan.

    Before the "Three-Anti" movement, some staff members of the Beijing Department Store Company accepted bribes from unscrupulous merchants and leaked price information, commodity inventory, and purchase and sales plans. For example, once, in order to sell more than 5,000 catties of sea cucumber, the company had sent people out to inquire about market prices in advance. However, the person sent was an agent of the bourgeoisie. He not only leaked the news to unscrupulous merchants, but also forged a false market report on the orders of unscrupulous merchants and reported it to the company's leadership. The unscrupulous merchants also agreed that the staff members sent by the company to investigate the market should all say that this kind of sea cucumber was worth at most 62,500 yuan per catty. When the company put up the price to sell sea cucumber, more than 5,000 catties of sea cucumber were snapped up by unscrupulous merchants in one day. In fact, the price of sea cucumber on the market at that time was 90,000 to 100,000 yuan per catty. In 1950, when the company sold a large number of paper, the same situation was found many times. In this way, unscrupulous merchants robbed the department store of its low-priced supply of goods to the citizens. In the past, the situation of disguised theft in some parts of the company's stores was also quite serious. When the cashier counter was abolished in 1950, it was discovered that the cashiers did not issue invoices or sell goods at prices, thereby stealing the extra payment after closing the account and entering their own pockets. When reporting to the superiors, they would lie and say, "The goods are short!" There were also the same bad situations in the sales of cloth and candy. Some candy merchants often only made up the weight when delivering goods to the department store, and cut corners on the quality, secretly sending extra "subsidies" to the sales staff. As a result of this practice, both unscrupulous merchants and thieves benefited, and the broad masses of customers were directly harmed!

    After the vigorous "Three-Anti" movement, the face of the Beijing Department Store Company has been renewed. The agents of the bourgeoisie and thieves who had been lurking in the company have either repented or been purged. The methods of processing, purchasing, and exchange have been improved, and the phenomenon of internal corruption and theft has been eliminated. At present, the company is in the process of establishing some new systems and relying on a large number of activists who have emerged after the movement as the backbone to mobilize all employees to do a good job in business and reduce operating management and transportation costs. At the same time, it has clarified the future work direction, vigorously implemented sales work, reduced inventory, and completed the task of sales and cash recovery. It is particularly emphasized to strengthen external contacts, consolidate and develop sales targets. Under such innovation, the department store company was able to reduce the prices of more than three thousand commodities.

    三千多种商品牌价为什么能够降低？
    ——北京百货公司反贪污反盗窃运动后的新气象
    何炳然
    中国百货公司北京市公司继三月三十日五百多种商品牌价降低之后，又于四月一日再度调低了三千三百多种上海商品的牌价。第一次最多的降低了百分之二十，平均降低百分之五。第二次最多的降低了百分之三十四点九五，平均降低了百分之七点五。广大的市民对这件事深表欢迎。这是反贪污反盗窃运动得来的成绩，它叫大家更进一步认识到反贪污反盗窃运动的伟大和正确。
    两三年来，北京市百货公司也同样遭受了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，很多干部被拉下水，堕落成为资产阶级的代理人，使国家资财、人民生活直接蒙受严重的损害。现在，那一撮“代理人”都已被清洗出去；绝大部分工作人员，经过这一运动的洗炼，已不断提高政治觉悟和业务水平，深刻认识了自己所负职责直接攸关人民生活的重要性，从而发挥了高度对人民负责的精神，业务和工作的制度，也得到了初步的改进。尤其与私营厂商加工定货、收购商品的来往中，已开始紧密依靠工人阶级，争取做到深入调查研究，精密而正确地核算商品的生产成本。这一着，不但揭穿了奸商们一贯哄抬成本的鬼技，同时由于认真点货检货，成品的质量也随之提高。这就是最近两次商品牌价之所以降低的根本原因。
    两年来，北京市百货公司对稳定物价、供应广大群众生活必需品的任务，是尽了它的职责的。这可从公司门市部经常挤满了顾客、业务发达的情况中找到说明。同时，另一面，它对北京市一百八十余家毛巾厂、七十余家织袜厂、六十余家服装厂、三十余家皮鞋厂也仁至义尽地做了不少扶植生产的工作。但，就在这种扶植的过程中，竟有不少唯利是图、损公济私的违法厂商，以怨报德，向百货公司进行了猖狂的进攻。百货公司的销售品，以袜子、毛巾、服装、皮鞋为大宗，这些货品在加工、采购、交换过程中，遭到奸商们的疯狂的盗窃。奸商们进行窃盗的主要方法，是勾引公司内部的工作人员，使他们变为自己的代理人、代言人，然后哄抬成本、偷工减料。在“三反”运动以前，公司对于加工定货核算成本的工作，除了几个业务小组长懂得一点之外，大部分工作人员是外行，于是被一个大贪污分子欺上瞒下，独手操纵。因此，与私商签订合同的时候，只要私商说什么、要多少，贪污分子就无不俯首帖耳，唯命是从的。交货时更是马马虎虎，不管三七二十一，闭着眼睛瞎收货。如一九五一年冬该公司给针织业第一联营小组加工做绒衣，第一次给它棉纱时，每捆能交成品一○六两，而第二次给它们的棉纱远比上一次好了，但交来的成品倒减至一○三两。相反地，加工费还大大地提高。在这样的情况下，收货人竟一句未提。经过“三反”运动，公司里的坏分子清洗出去了，一般工作人员责任心都提高了，开始扭改过去“心中无数”的现象和盲目工作的作风。尤其在核算生产成本一点上，更争取做到深入调查研究、精打细算的地步。每次公司与私商协商核订成本之前，总先派人深入工厂，通过依靠工会和工人中的积极分子了解生产过程中所化的人工及开支项目的情况，进行详细的研究，求得比较接近实际的成本价格。做到了事先心中有数。有了这个有利条件，再与私商协商，适当地照顾他们的合法利润，私商也不得不认为合理，愿意修改他们自己过高计算的成本。有的资本家还惊问：“你们怎么会了解得这么详细啊！我们真该向你们学习了。”这样，不但收到了成本降低的效果，同时也保证了成品质量的提高。如该公司过去与私营一中袜厂关于二十支织花罗口袜所订的合同，规定每捆二十支的棉纱，交换成品七打六双，加工米一二八斤；而现在重订合同时，交换成品则已增至七打九双，加工米降至一○一斤了。这样，厂方也还可获纯利百分之五到百分之十。服装的加工费，也平均较以前减低百分之五到百分之十，而且规定他每一个长度单位的缝针的针数。皮鞋每双加工费现在比过去约便宜两万元，而且做工规定要比过去还坚实些。此外，在发料方面，也有一个很大的改变。过去公司将整匹布、盘套皮发给私商，让他们自己裁剪偷料，甚至换料。现在公司已自雇工人裁剪。这样不但可以堵塞漏洞，而且余下大量的碎布碎皮，作为副产品出售（碎衣每斤可卖一千五百元），收入也不少。过去，这些全是一批批遗落在私商的手里的。
    过去，百货公司为了扶植北京市某些中小工业的生产，曾经开展经销业务（即代私商销售货品，只拿手续费）。但是奸商们竟忘恩负义，大钻经销的空子，他们的手段是对公司委托他们加工的货品，大事偷工减料，不照原来规格交货。制服不是上身做得顶短，就是下身裤脚做得很小，不是领口顶紧，就是袖口缺一节。而商人对他自己代销的东西，做得合乎规格，式样也好，这样，经销货品较公司货品价虽较高而卖得出去，公司货品便卖不出去。百货公司几乎变成了为私商销售商品的商店。为此，无形中抬高货价，损害了人民的购买力。目前该公司已明确规定，除有特殊技术性商品又为广大群众所需要者，其他所有经销业务，原则上一律停止进行。这样做，使公司货品能按业务计划廉价地供应市民。
    在“三反”运动前，北京市百货公司某些工作人员，因为接受奸商贿赂，泄露物价情报、商品库存、采购销售计划。如有一次，公司为想销售五千多斤海参，预先曾派人出外打听市价，而这被派的人，却是资产阶级的代理人，他不但走漏消息给奸商，还奉奸商之命伪造一个假行情，报告公司领导上。奸商们还约好对公司再派来调查行情的工作人员，一律回说这种海参最多只值六万二千五百元一斤。当公司挂出牌价出售海参的时候，一天之内五千多斤海参即被奸商们抢购一空。实际上当时市面每斤海参的价格是九万到十万元。一九五○年，该公司销售大批纸张时，也曾发现有同样的情况多次。奸商们就是这样地劫夺百货公司对市民的商品的廉价供应。过去，该公司门市部某些部分，变相偷窃的情况也相当严重。一九五○年取消收款台时，即曾发现收款员不开发票或不按价格销货，从而在结账后窃取多余的货款，进入私囊。而向上级报销时，则瞎说：“货短啦！”又在销售布匹和糖果部分，也有同样恶劣的情况，一面少给顾客尺寸、斤两，一面虚报消耗率，双重贪污。有些糖果业奸商向百货公司交货时，常只凑足斤两，而在质量上则大事偷工减料，暗底里向售货员送额外“补贴”。这种做法的结果，奸商与盗窃分子都得利了，而直接受害的就只是广大的顾客！
    经过雷厉风行的“三反”运动，北京市百货公司的面貌一新了。过去潜伏在该公司的资产阶级代理人和盗窃分子，悔悟的悔悟，清除的清除出去了。加工、采购、交换的办法改善了，内部贪污盗窃现象消灭了。目前该公司正着手进行某些新制度的建立和依靠运动后涌现出来的大批积极分子做骨干发动全体职工来搞好业务，减低经营管理和运输费用。同时，明确了今后工作方针，大力贯彻推销工作，减缩库存，完成销货回笼的任务。特别强调加强对外联系，巩固与发展销货对象，在这样的革新下，百货公司才得能降低三千多种商品牌价。
