    Nurseries and Nursing Homes Bring Happiness to Nanning Dockworkers

    Editor: The welfare work for dock porters in Nanning City, Guangxi Province, has gradually improved. To take care of the porters, the Municipal People's Government has established nurseries and nursing homes. Workers can entrust their children to the nurseries to be raised, so they can work with peace of mind. Before liberation, the female worker Li Xiangfu had seven children, but because of poverty, all seven children died. Now, seeing the happy lives of the children in the nursery, she couldn't help but shed tears. Over time, the children's mothers and the caregivers have established a deep affection. The caregivers have even greater confidence in their work, saying: "Doing a good job in childcare is truly serving the people." The workers' nursing home accommodates elderly workers who have lost their ability to work. There are now twenty-seven elderly people living in the home. All expenses such as food and clothing are paid by the government. Initially, many elderly workers were unwilling to go in, disliking the crowdedness of the nursing home, not wanting to live collectively, and fearing that food and accommodation would not be satisfactory. However, after they entered the home, they saw that the nursing home was well-equipped and the care was very attentive, and they realized that their ideas were wrong. The elderly people in the home now feel very happy, and one old worker said: "Chairman Mao is so good to us, we are so happy."

    托儿所和养老院给南宁码头工人带来了幸福
    编辑同志：广西省南宁市码头搬运工人的福利工作已经逐步改善了。市人民政府为了照顾搬运工人，成立了托儿所和养老院。工人们把小孩委托给托儿所抚养，就可以安心工作了。女工李香甫在解放前生过七个孩子，因为生活穷困，把七个孩子都活生生地弄死了。现在，她看到孩子们在托儿所的幸福生活，不禁感动得流下泪来。日子久了，孩子们的妈妈和保育员建立了深厚的情感。保育员的工作信心更高了，她们说：“搞好保育工作，就是真正为人民服务。”工人养老院收容没有劳动力的年老工人。现在院里已住了二十七位老人。一切衣食等费用都由政府负担。开始，很多老年工人不愿意进去，嫌养老院人多，不想过集体生活，害怕吃、住不能如意。但是，他们进了院以后，看到养老院设备很好，照顾又很周到，他们才知道自己的想法是错了。院里的老人现在都感到很愉快幸福，一个老工人说：“毛主席对我们这样好，我们真是太幸福了。”                周德仁
