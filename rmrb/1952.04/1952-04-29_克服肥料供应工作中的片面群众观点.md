    Overcoming the One-Sided Mass Perspective in Fertilizer Supply Work

    Currently, in fertilizer supply work, many cadres of Party organizations, people's governments, mass organizations, and cooperatives in various regions have an erroneous argument, saying that farmers are unable to purchase fertilizer, and advocating that cooperatives massively sell fertilizer to the masses on credit. This argument and proposition violate the spirit of accelerating capital turnover and supplying farmers with a large amount of fertilizer; moreover, it does not conform to the actual situation of farmers' current ability to purchase fertilizer. The typical investigations of farmers' ability to purchase fertilizer in Yanshi, Henan, and Xiangyang, Hubei, and the experience of cooperatives in Wenden Prefecture, Shandong, in ordering and purchasing fertilizer on behalf of farmers, published in today's newspaper, are a powerful criticism of this erroneous argument and proposition.

    The investigation materials from three villages in Yanshi County, Henan, and Xiangyang County, Hubei, show that ordinary farmers are capable of purchasing fertilizer with cash. Some people have already purchased enough fertilizer to meet their current needs, and can even save some for autumn use.

    The experience of cooperatives in Wenden Prefecture in ordering and purchasing fertilizer on behalf of farmers further proves that not only can farmers purchase fertilizer from cooperatives with cash, but after in-depth mobilization, farmers can also pre-pay cooperatives to order or entrust them to purchase the fertilizer they need (similar to the method of farmers in the Southern Jiangsu region depositing money with cooperatives to pre-purchase fertilizer). This expands the capital of cooperatives for supplying fertilizer, so as to supply more fertilizer needed by the vast number of farmers.

    Are there any difficulties for farmers in purchasing fertilizer? Yes. For example, among the one hundred and eleven households in Zhaihou Village, Yanshi County, there are indeed a few families who are unable to purchase fertilizer. Such households generally account for only a very small number in most areas; for them, it is also appropriate for cooperatives to provide assistance by selling fertilizer on credit and ordering their products. In addition, farmers in many areas have accumulated some local products and are therefore unable to immediately purchase fertilizer with cash. For such situations, the problem can be solved as long as the cooperatives combine the work of supplying fertilizer with promoting the sale of farmers' local products. In short, large-scale sales on credit are unnecessary and impossible.

    Some cadres who say that farmers are unable to purchase fertilizer and advocate large-scale sales on credit often claim to have a "very mass perspective"; this one-sided mass perspective is essentially contrary to the mass perspective. If we follow the opinions of these people and massively sell fertilizer to the masses on credit, the result will inevitably be that the capital of cooperatives for supplying fertilizer will stagnate, preventing the vast number of farmers from obtaining the fertilizer they need. This is obviously detrimental to the production and life of the masses. These cadres do not seriously study the instructions from higher authorities, nor do they conduct in-depth investigations and extensive publicity and education among the masses, do not understand the production situation and needs of the masses, but only shout empty slogans of "mass perspective," pitting a part of the masses against the whole, and pitting the immediate interests of some farmers against their long-term interests. This subjective and one-sided ideological style should be resolutely overcome.

### 克服肥料供应工作中的片面群众观点

    克服肥料供应工作中的片面群众观点
    目前在肥料供应工作中，各地党的组织、人民政府、群众团体以及合作社的不少干部有一种错误的论调，说农民无力购买肥料，主张由合作社大量向群众赊销肥料。这种论调和主张，是违背加速资金周转、大量供应农民用肥的精神的；而且也不符合当前农民购肥能力的实际情况。今天本报所发表的河南偃师和湖北襄阳农民购买肥料能力的典型调查、山东文登专区合作社定购和代购肥料的经验两文，对这种错误的论调和主张是个有力的批判。
    河南偃师县及湖北襄阳县三个村的调查材料，说明一般农民是有能力以现款购买肥料的。有的人已购的肥料除满足当前需要外，并可余下一部到秋天用。
    文登专区合作社定购和代购肥料的经验并进一步证明：不但农民可以用现款向合作社购肥，在进行深入的动员以后，农民还可以预先向合作社交款定购或委托代购所需肥料（类似苏南区农民向合作社存实预购肥料的办法）。这样就扩大了合作社供应肥料的资金，以便更多地供应广大农民所需要的肥料。
    农民在购买肥料中有没有困难呢？有的。例如偃师县砦后村一百一十一户农民中，真正无力购肥的也有几家。这样的农户在一般地区都只占极少数；对于他们，合作社采取赊销肥料并定购他们的产品的办法给以照顾，也是应该的。此外，很多地区的农民，手里积压了一些土产，因此不能立即拿现款买肥料。对于这样的情形，只要合作社把供应肥料和推销农民的土产的工作结合起来，问题就可以解决。总之，大量赊销是不必要也不可能的。
    说农民无力购买肥料而主张大量赊销的一些干部，往往自命“很有群众观点”；这种片面的群众观点，实质上是违背群众观点的。如果按着这些人的意见，大量向群众赊销肥料，结果必然使合作社供应肥料的资金呆滞，使广大农民不能获得所需的肥料。这对群众的生产和生活显然是不利的。这些干部对上级的指示不认真研究、也不向群众作深入的调查和广泛的宣传教育，不了解群众的生产情况和需要，而只是空喊“群众观点”，把部分群众和群众的整体对立起来，把某些农民眼前的利益和长远的利益对立起来。这种主观片面的思想作风，应当坚决予以克服。
