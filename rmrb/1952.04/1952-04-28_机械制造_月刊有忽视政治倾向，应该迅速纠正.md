    "Mechanical Manufacturing" Monthly Neglects Political Tendencies, Should Be Corrected Swiftly
    Editor: The "Mechanical Manufacturing" monthly has consistently neglected politics. For the past two years, the publication has not expressed a clear stance on major political movements. Under the guidance of this editorial ideology that ignores politics, many political errors have occurred. For example, the journal published an article in Volume 2, Issue 1, titled "A Review of Shanghai's Machine Manufacturing Industry in the Past Year." In this article, the author excessively exaggerated the positivity of the bourgeoisie. The author stated: "The industry... has abandoned its past speculative and comprador nature, and generally... no longer hoards materials for speculation or solely pursues commercial profits." This is clearly inconsistent with the facts. The journal published an article in Volume 2, Issue 9, titled "Casting Design and Economic Molding Method." The author openly advocated for so-called "production competition" in the article. The author said that if the molding method is not improved, it "cannot compete with other better manufacturing methods." However, the purpose of improving our operating methods is to create more wealth for the motherland. This article promotes "competition" with other methods. What a harmful statement! Since the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were launched nationwide, "Mechanical Manufacturing" did not publish an editorial titled "Understanding the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements" until March 25th. This article only listed some of the criminal acts of illegal bourgeois elements and did not analyze or critique some of the incorrect thoughts existing among engineering and technical personnel.
    I believe that the comrades of the "Mechanical Manufacturing" editorial department must quickly examine their work and establish a correct future direction. Only in this way can they better serve the country's industrial construction.

### “机械制造”月刊有忽视政治倾向，应该迅速纠正

    “机械制造”月刊有忽视政治倾向，应该迅速纠正
    编辑同志：“机械制造”月刊一向忽视政治。两年来，该刊对各项重大的政治运动，都没有表示显明的态度。在这种忽视政治的编辑思想指导下，于是发生了不少政治性的错误。例如，该刊二卷一期发表了一篇“上海市机器制造业一年来的回顾”的文章，作者在这篇文章中，过分地夸大了资产阶级的积极性。作者说：“本业……舍弃了过去的投机性和买办性，一般的都……不再囤料投机，不单纯追求商业利润”。这显然是和事实不符的。该刊二卷九期发表了一篇题为“铸品设计及经济制型法”的文章，作者竟在文中公开鼓吹所谓“生产竞争”。作者说，如果制型法不加改进，那就“不能同别种更好的制造方法去竞争”。但是，我们改进操作方法的目的，乃是为了更多地替祖国创造财富，而这篇文章却提倡同别的方法作“竞争”。这是多么有害的说法！伟大的“三反”“五反”运动在全国开展以来，“机械制造”直到三月二十五日才发表了一篇“对三反、五反运动的认识”的社论。该文仅仅列举了一些不法资产阶级分子的罪恶行为，没有对工程技术人员所存在的一些不正确思想，加以分析和批判。
    我认为“机械制造”编辑部的同志必须迅速检查自己的工作，定出今后的正确方针。只有这样，才能更好地为祖国的工业建设服务。
