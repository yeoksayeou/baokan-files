    The Yishui Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Should Not Neglect Leadership of Party Newspaper Work

    To the Editor: The Yishui Rural News of Shandong is the organ of the Yishui Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but the Yishui Local Committee never attaches importance to using the newspaper to guide work. The instructions and plans of the local committee and the special commissioner's office for current tasks are distributed to the county-level organs and below, but not to the newspaper office. For example, the local committee's instructions on drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing were issued to the county on February 22, but the newspaper office did not know about it. It was not until March 7 that the newspaper office found a copy in the local committee's archives and published it. The special district's 1952 production plan and mutual aid and cooperation plan were both delayed for more than half a month before being sent to the newspaper office. The special commissioner's office held meetings of cotton high-yield representatives, mutual aid representatives, and production evaluation meetings, but the comrades working at the newspaper office only found out after the meetings were over. Although the Yishui Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also made a decision on establishing the Yishui Rural News, the lower-level party committees neglected it because the local committee itself did not attach importance to it. For example, the propaganda committee member of the first district committee of Junan County still does not know that the local committee has made this decision.

    When the newspaper was launched, Comrade Di Sheng, the Minister of Propaganda of the Local Committee, stated that he would "devote one-third of his time to leading the newspaper." But this is not the case in reality. Comrade Di Sheng has not been responsible for providing systematic instructions on the work of the newspaper office, and fundamentally neglects the political leadership of the Party newspaper. Once, the newspaper office's radio broke down. In order not to delay work, the newspaper office borrowed his radio from Comrade Di Sheng to receive broadcasts, but was refused by him.

    Another serious problem is that the cadres of the leading organs do not read their own newspapers. The organs of the local committee and the special commissioner's office have not formally subscribed. The construction section, which guides agricultural construction in the entire district, did not know about the newspaper even one month after its publication. The secretary of the agricultural committee of the local committee also does not read the newspaper. The newspaper continuously reported on the high-yield households in the Yishui Special District who increased their unit area yield in January, but he did not know about it. The secretary of the local committee and the special commissioner also do not know about the major activities of the farmers in the district reported in the newspaper.

    In order to improve our newspaper and give play to its role, we suggest that the Yishui Local Committee seriously examine its leadership of the newspaper and specifically formulate effective measures to improve the work of the newspaper.

    中共沂水地方委员会
    不该忽视对党报工作的领导
    编辑同志：山东沂水农村报是中共沂水地方委员会的机关报，但沂水地方委员会从不重视运用报纸来指导工作。地委、专署对当前各项工作的指示、计划等文件，发到县级机关以下，但不发给报社。如地委对防旱抗旱春耕工作指示是二月二十二日发到县的，但报社不知道。直到三月七日，报社才从地委的档案里找到一份发表了。专区一九五二年生产计划、互助合作计划等都是拖到半个多月才发到报社来。专署开种棉丰产代表会议、互助代表会议、评产会议，报社的工作同志都是在会议结束了才知道。虽然中共沂水地委也曾做出关于创办沂水农村报的决定，但由于地委本身不重视，下面各级党委也就忽视它。如莒南县一区区委宣传委员到现在还不知道地委有这个决定。
    在报纸创刊时，地委宣传部长狄生同志曾表示要“拿出三分之一的时间来领导报纸”。但实际不是如此。狄生同志没有负责对报社工作提出系统的指示，根本忽视了对党报的政治领导。有一次，报社的收音机坏了，为了不误工作，报社向狄生同志借用他的收音机收音，却遭到他的拒绝。
    另外一个严重的问题，就是领导机关的干部不看自己的报纸。地委、专署机关就没有正式订阅；指导全区农业建设的建设科，在报纸出刊一个月后，还不知道有这个报纸。地委农委会书记也不看报，报纸在一月份连续报道沂水专区提高单位面积产量的丰产户情况，他就不知道。地委书记、专员对报纸刊载的本区农民的重大活动也不知道。
    为了改进我们的报纸，发挥报纸的作用，我们建议沂水地委应认真检查对报纸的领导，具体订出改进报纸工作的有效办法。
