Shanxi Province recently convened a provincial conference of directors of state-owned farms last month. Based on the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural production in 1952, this conference discussed and stipulated the tasks of state-owned farms at all levels in Shanxi Province this year, and also discussed how state-owned farms can actively participate in the production increase competition.

Wu Guangtang, Director of the Agriculture Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, summarized the work of the farms last year, saying: All farms have made achievements in the past, but because the demonstration role of state-owned farms in guiding farmers to gradually embark on collectivized and modernized agricultural management is not yet clearly understood, some of the existing 100 farms are not yet equipped with technical personnel, and the equipment of draught animals, farm tools, and houses is also insufficient; some farms have a tendency to focus solely on internal experiments, while others have a tendency to only pay attention to promoting technology outside the farm.

The conference stipulated that this year, state-owned farms at all levels in Shanxi Province should become banners of high-yield demonstration and the core for guiding farmers to improve technology. First, all land of farms at all levels should achieve high yields, and new high-yield records should be created for several major crops. Farms with a good foundation should have a total average yield of various crops exceeding the yield of local farmers by more than 20%; and create the highest high-yield record for the unit area yield of several major crops in the local area. Farms with a slightly weaker foundation should achieve an average yield of the entire farm exceeding the yield of local farmers by 10%, and create high-yield records for one or more crops. Farms with poor conditions and imperfect equipment must also have yields of various crops that catch up with the production level of ordinary farmers.

Second, under the leadership of the local people's government, farms at all levels should widely establish agricultural technology promotion networks in rural areas and carry out mass technology improvement movements. In old liberated areas, technical committees should be universally established in rural areas, and professional training should be conducted for farmers separately; in new liberated areas with many mutual aid teams, efforts should be made to establish technical committees in one-third of the villages. The province should strive to have technical instructors in every mutual aid team and establish small farms and seed plots within two or three years. Local farms should use agricultural technology promotion networks to conduct training courses, exhibitions, and hold small seminars, establish transmission stations, and other forms to guide farmers to improve technology at any time. Each farm should cultivate three farmer model laborers for high yield, guide them in science and technology, and help them summarize high-yield experience and promote it.

At the end of the conference, the farms of Yangqu, Wuxiang, Jiexian, Yicheng, Yushe, and Lishi counties were selected as model farms. The six model farms immediately set out conditions at the meeting and jointly challenged all farms in the province to a competition. Many farms immediately set out specific production increase conditions to accept the challenge. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省召开全省国营农场场长会议
    规定各级国营农场应成为丰产示范的旗帜和指导农民改良技术的核心
    山西省上月召开了全省国营农场场长会议。这次会议根据中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定，讨论并规定了今年山西省各级国营农场的任务，同时讨论了国营农场如何积极参加增产竞赛问题。
    山西省人民政府农业厅厅长武光汤，总结去年农场的工作说：过去各农场都有成绩，但因为对于国营农场引导农民逐步走上农业经营集体化、近代化的示范作用认识还不明确，以致现有的一百个农场中，有些还没有配备技术干部，耕畜和农具、房屋等设备也不够；有些农场有关门试验的偏向，有些又有只注意场外推广技术的偏向。
    会议规定：今年山西省各级国营农场，应该成为丰产示范的旗帜和指导农民改良技术的核心。第一、要求各级农场的土地全部丰产，在几种主要作物上，创造丰产新纪录。基础好的农场各种农作物的总平均产量要超过当地农民产量百分之二十以上；并在几种主要作物上，创造当地单位面积产量的最高丰产纪录。基础稍差的农场，要作到全场土地平均产量超过当地农民产量百分之十，并创造一种以上作物的丰产纪录。条件不好，设备不完善的农场，各种农作物的产量也须赶上一般农民的生产水平。
    第二、各级农场应在当地人民政府领导下，在农村中广泛的建立农业技术推进网，开展群众性的技术改良运动。老区的农村要普遍建立技术委员会，并对农民分别进行专业训练；新区互助组多的地方，应争取有三分之一的村庄建立技术委员会。全省争取在两、三年内，每个互助组都有技术指导员，都建立有小农场和留种地。各地农场应通过农业技术推进网，举办训练班、展览会、和举行小型座谈会、建立传授站等形式，随时指导农民改进技术。每个农场要培养三个农民丰产模范，在科学技术上指导他们，并帮助他们总结丰产经验，加以推广。
    会议最后评选阳曲、武乡、解县、翼城、榆社与离石六个县农场为模范农场。六个模范农场在会上立即订出条件，联名向全省农场挑战竞赛。当场就有许多农场订出具体增产条件应战。（新华社）
