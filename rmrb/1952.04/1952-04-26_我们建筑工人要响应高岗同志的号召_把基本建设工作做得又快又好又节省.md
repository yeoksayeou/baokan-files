    Our Construction Workers Must Respond to Comrade Gao Gang's Call to Do Basic Construction Work Quickly, Well, and Economically
    Construction Industry Labor Model Su Changyou
    Comrade Gao Gang, at the graduation ceremony of the construction class of the Northeast Workers' Political University, issued a call to us construction workers, asking us to carry out this year's basic construction "quickly, well, and economically." In welcoming the "May 1st" International Labor Day, we construction workers should respond to Comrade Gao Gang's call with full confidence and be sure to carry out this year's basic construction "quickly, well, and economically."
    How can we carry out basic construction "quickly, well, and economically"? I think we construction workers should do these things well:
    The first important thing in our construction this year is to strive to promote advanced experience. This year, our country has a large basic construction task. We have few skilled workers, and our skills are not high. Seeing that the country's large-scale construction is about to begin, the task of basic construction will be even greater at that time. If we still use the old methods of the past, how can we quickly complete the glorious task that the country has given us? Last year, I learned the Soviet Sherkov advanced bricklaying method and created the segmented continuous bricklaying method, which made my work much faster, exceeding the quota by more than double. Workers across the country have learned this new method, and some workers, like Yang Dezong, Fu Hongbin, and Zhang Ruiji, have come up with even better methods to improve efficiency even more. This year, we must learn from the existing advanced work methods and use our brains to tap potential, find shortcuts, and create more and better advanced work methods. In this way, we can overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the country and move the tasks forward phase by phase. For a task that takes two months, we must find a way to complete it in a month and a half. In this way, we can save the country half a month's management fees and allow our constructed factories to start production earlier; wouldn't this allow us to increase production and save a lot of wealth for the country?
    Comrade Gao Gang wants us to "economize," and we must do this. Peasant brothers pick up every grain of rice that falls on the ground. We should learn from them. We must not casually take away or throw away a nail, half a brick, a piece of broken tile, or a piece of wood. If a piece of ash falls to the ground, we should feel more distressed than seeing our own steamed bun fall on the ground. When using materials for work, use small ones if possible, and don't use large ones. At every moment, we must remember to save for the country. We must not only save ourselves, but also fight against all waste phenomena. I remember once, when a worker was making windows, he suggested to the material clerk to use smaller wood and leave the larger wood for more important places. The material clerk did not accept this good suggestion, but impatiently said: "There is plenty of money!" If we encounter this situation again in the future, we must resolutely fight and never let bureaucrats waste state property again. We must also strengthen labor discipline ourselves, arrive at the site early every day, and do a safety inspection first. If an accident occurs and people are injured, that is the greatest loss to the country.
    Comrade Gao Gang wants us to do the project "well," and we must also do it; we must find every way to ensure that the project quality meets the standards. In the past, embezzlers colluded with unscrupulous merchants and recklessly cut corners in basic construction, making projects full of problems and short-lived, causing unimaginable disasters to the country. In the future, whether we are building houses for the country or for private individuals, we must take a responsible attitude as masters of the country. Because these are all the property of the country and the people. If we find bad elements cutting corners, directing us to do something wrong, or using the wrong materials, no matter how much money they give us, we will resolutely not do it, and we will also report them to higher authorities. We must make this determination. As long as the house is built with our own hands, we want it to be beautiful and solid! We can also compete with each other to see who builds the best house!
    It is not easy to do these things well. We must first improve our class consciousness and unite with technical personnel to learn technology from them wholeheartedly.
    The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have paved the way for our basic construction. Embezzlers and unscrupulous merchants no longer dare to act recklessly. Cadres and technical personnel are also closer to us workers and are willing to listen to us workers. Our workers' class consciousness has also been greatly improved in this movement. As long as we unite in the future and add a little effort, we will definitely be able to do a good job in this year's basic construction.

### 我们建筑工人要响应高岗同志的号召  把基本建设工作做得又快又好又节省

    我们建筑工人要响应高岗同志的号召
    把基本建设工作做得又快又好又节省
    建筑工业劳动模范  苏长有
    高岗同志在东北工人政治大学建筑班结业会上，向我们建筑工人发出了号召，要我们把今年的基本建设搞得“又快、又好、又省”。在迎接“五一”国际劳动节时，我们建筑工人应该信心百倍地响应高岗同志的号召，一定要把今年的基本建设搞得“又快、又好、又省”。
    怎样才能把基本建设搞得“又快、又好、又省”呢？我想我们建筑工人应该做好这几样事情：
    我们今年施工中的第一件重要事情是努力推广先进经验。今年咱们国家的基本建设任务很大。咱们的技术工人少，技术也不高。眼看着国家的大建设就要开始了，那时候基本建设的任务就更大了。假使咱们还用过去那种老办法干活，怎么能很快地完成国家给我们的光荣任务呢？去年我学了苏联舍尔科夫先进砌砖法，创造了分段连续砌砖法，干活就快了很多，超过了定额一倍多。全国各地的工友们学习了这个新办法，有些工友，像杨德重、傅鸿宾、张瑞吉他们又想出了更好的方法，把效率提得更高。今年，我们要一面学习已有的先进工作法，一面开动脑筋，挖潜力，找窍门，创造出更多的更好的先进工作方法。这样，我们就能够超额完成国家给我们的任务，把任务一期一期地往前赶。两个月的任务，我们要想法在一个半月完成。这样，就可以给国家节省半个月的管理费，还可以让我们建筑的工厂早日开始生产；这不就可以给国家增产节约很多财富吗？
    高岗同志要我们“省”，这一点我们一定得做到。农民弟兄们掉地下一粒米都要赶忙拣起来。我们应该向他们学习。一个钉子，半截砖头，一块碎瓦，一截木料，我们都不能随便拿走或扔掉。掉地下
    一块灰，我们要比看见自己家的馒头掉在地上还心疼。干活用材料时，能用小的就不要用大的。一时一刻，我们都得记住为国家节省。我们不但要自己节省，还要向一切浪费现象作斗争。我记得有一次，一个工友做窗户时，向材料员建议用小一点的木料，把大的留着用到更重要的地方。材料员不接受这个好意见，反而不耐烦地说：“有的是钱！”以后要是再遇见这种情况，我们就要坚决地进行斗争，决不让官僚主义者再浪费国家财产。我们自己还得加强劳动纪律，每天早到现场，先做好安全检查。要是出了事故，伤了人，那就是国家最大的损失。
    高岗同志要我们把工程做得“好”，我们也一定要做到；要想一切办法保证工程质量合乎标准。过去，贪污分子们和奸商勾结起来，在基本建设中无法无天地偷工减料，做出来的工程毛病百出，寿命不长，给国家造下的祸害真是想都没法想。以后，不管是给国家或是给私人盖房子，我们都得拿出国家主人翁的负责态度。因为，这都是国家和人民的财产。要是我们发现坏分子们偷工减料，指挥我们做的不对，或者让我们用的材料不对，不管他们给多少钱，我们就是坚决不给干，并且还要向上级控告他们。我们一定要下这个决心。只要是用我们自己的手盖起的房子，我们就要它漂漂亮亮结结实实的！我们还可以互相比赛一下，看谁盖的房子好！
    要做好这些事情，也不是容易的。我们首先得提高自己的阶级觉悟，同时还得团结技术人员，用心地向他们学技术。
    伟大的“三反”“五反”运动已经给我们的基本建设铺平了道路。贪污分子们和奸商们再也不敢那样为非作歹了。干部和技术人员也更接近我们工人了，肯听我们工人的话了。我们工人的阶级觉悟在这次运动中也大大提高了。只要今后我们团结起来，加上一把劲，一定能把今年的基本建设搞好。
