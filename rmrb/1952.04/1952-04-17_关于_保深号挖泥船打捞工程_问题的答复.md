    Reply Regarding the "Salvage Project of Dredger 'Baoshen'"

    Editor: People's Daily published a reader's letter on February 18 criticizing the salvage project of the dredger "Baoshen." This criticism is fundamentally correct. The enthusiasm of Comrade Wu Baonong in caring about the motherland's construction is worthy of praise. We have instructed the Shanghai Port Authority to send technical personnel to the site for inspection. Now, inspection reports from both the Shanghai Port Authority and the China National Salvage Company have been received, and we are studying them. We plan to provide a detailed response in the newspaper regarding how this issue will be handled after the entire case is concluded.

    关于“保深号挖泥船打捞工程”问题的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报二月十八日发表了批评保深号挖泥船打捞工程的读者来信。这个批评基本上是正确的。吴葆农同志这种关心祖国建设事业的热忱，是值得表扬的。我们已责成上海区港务局派技术人员赴现场进行检查。现在上海区港务局及中国人民打捞公司双方的检查报告已经送到，我们正研究检查中。这个问题如何处理，我们准备在全案结束后，再在报上作一详细的答复。
