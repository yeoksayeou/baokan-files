    Two Locomotives of Zhangjiakou Railway Section Exceed the Goal of 250,000 Kilometers of Safe Driving
    To the Editor: By April 17th, the No. ㄇ丂1-511 and No. 1949 locomotives of the Zhangjiakou Railway Section had safely traveled more than 265,000 kilometers and 251,000 kilometers respectively in the past three years. The reason they were able to exceed the 250,000-kilometer goal was that the teams thoroughly implemented various regulations and observed labor discipline. The No. 1511 locomotive crew implemented a three-check acceptance system during scheduled maintenance and never missed an inspection. The No. 1949 locomotive crew carefully implemented the call-and-response procedure during operation, thereby preventing two accidents that could have interfered with train operation. They frequently contacted the factory to study the locomotive's condition and had a sound lubrication system, which kept the two locomotives well-maintained and highly efficient. The No. 1511 locomotive crew also had the advantage of humbly studying working methods. Last year, when the section was learning the advanced experience of softening the hard water of locomotives, the team, based on actual conditions, researched a method of discharging water on uphill and downhill slopes, found the cause of the co-boiling of steam and water after softening, and improved it. Therefore, the team pioneered a new record of more than 7,600 kilometers of washing and inspection in the section, increasing work efficiency by nearly one time. Now, the crews of these two locomotives are proposing a struggle plan of 300,000 kilometers of safe driving as a gift to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

    张家口机务段两台机车超过安全行驶二十五万公里的目标
    编辑同志：张家口机务段冖丂1一五一一号和一九四九号两台机车，到四月十七日止，三年来安全行驶了二十六万五千多公里和二十五万一千多公里。他们所以能超过二十五万公里的奋斗目标，是因为组内彻底执行了各种制度和遵守劳动纪律的缘故。一五一一号机车包乘组在定检内实行三检验收制度，始终没有发生过漏检。一九四九号机车包乘组在乘务中认真执行了呼喊应答，因而曾防止了两件妨碍行车的事故。他们经常和工厂联系研究机车情况，又有健全的给油制度，使两台机车保养得很好，效率很高。一五一一号机车包乘组的组员还有个优点，就是虚心钻研工作方法。去年段内学习把机车的硬水软化的先进经验时，小组内根据实际条件，研究出上下坡放水法，找出了施行软水后汽水共腾的原因，并加以改进。因此，该组在段内首创洗检公里七千六百多公里的新纪录，提高工作效率将近一倍。现在，这两台机车包乘组正提出安全行驶三十万公里的奋斗计划，作为迎接“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。    王建堂  康满良
