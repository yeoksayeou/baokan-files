    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Spring Grain Storage
    Currently, public grain reserves in many places are experiencing insect damage, heating, mildew, and rot. The main reasons for this situation are: some leading cadres have a paralyzing thought that "there are no problems with grain in the spring," and have relaxed the supervision and inspection of grain storage work; some grain work cadres in counties and districts have an unclear understanding of the significance of the "Three-Anti" movement, and some are unclean themselves, ideologically confused, and not dedicated to their work, which affects the storage of grain.
    Financial leading cadres in various regions should conduct political and professional education for grain work cadres, so that everyone recognizes the great political significance of granary work, and also recognizes that spring is the season when grain is most susceptible to insects and mildew, and eliminate paralyzing thoughts. For some grain work cadres who have ideological concerns and are not dedicated to their work due to their own uncleanliness, they should be told that only by actively doing their work can they atone for their crimes, and passive怠工 [malicious slow-down] will only aggravate their mistakes. In addition, grain storage departments at all levels should strengthen grain protection organizations, organize grain inspection teams to conduct thorough inspections of granaries; actively carry out granary pest control, and conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention is more important than cure"; strengthen ventilation equipment to reduce grain moisture, and immediately carry out ventilation and sunning for grain with excessive moisture and temperature. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen contact with local public security and armed departments, strengthen education and leadership of mass grain protection organizations, and rely on the power of the masses to conscientiously do a good job in spring grain storage.

    切实做好春季粮食保管工作
    目前许多地方库存公粮发生虫蚀、发热、霉烂等现象。发生这种情况的主要原因是：部分领导干部有“春季粮食无问题”的麻痹思想，放松了对粮食保管工作的督促检查；县区有部分粮食工作干部，对“三反”运动的意义认识不清，有的自己手脚不干净，思想混乱，不安心工作，影响了粮食的保管。
    各地财政领导干部，应该对粮食工作干部进行政治教育和业务教育，使大家认识粮库工作的重大政治意义，并认识春季正是粮食最易生虫、霉烂的季节，肃清麻痹思想。对一部分粮食工作干部因手脚不干净，而存在着思想顾虑、不安心工作的，应向他们讲明：只有积极地做好工作才能立功赎罪，消极怠工就是加重自己的错误。此外，各级粮食保管部门还要加强护粮组织，组织查仓队，普遍深入地检查粮仓；要积极开展仓虫防治工作，认真贯彻“防重于治”的方针；要加强通风设备，降低粮食水分，部分水分和温度过高的，应立即进行出风翻晒。同时要加强和地方公安武装部门的联系，并对群众护粮组织加强教育和领导，依靠群众的力量切实作好春季粮食保管工作。
