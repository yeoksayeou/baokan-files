The Economic Life of the People in Minority Areas is on the Rise

Trade between Yunnan and Tibet Returns to Normal
Scale Approaches Pre-War Levels

Trade between Yunnan Province and Tibet has now fully returned to normal. Tibetan and Han merchants stranded in Lhasa have successively gone to Yunnan to purchase goods. Many of their mule and horse teams arrived in Lijiang County, the commercial center of northwestern Yunnan, in November last year, transporting a large number of Tibetan products such as fritillary bulbs, cordyceps, musk, sheepskin, and woolen fabrics (氆氇) and other goods, totaling more than 800 pack loads. The scale of trade has approached the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Thanks to the assistance of the Lijiang State-Owned Trading Company, these Tibetan and Han merchants have greatly benefited in selling and purchasing goods. Currently, it is the season of warm spring and growing grass. These merchants are preparing goods in Lijiang, Xiaguan, and other places, and following the usual practice of grazing mules and horses in Yunnan's Heqing, Eryuan, Dengchuan, and other counties. Once the goods are ready and the horses are fattened, they will set off for Lhasa to participate in the Lhasa Trade Fair in the middle of the eighth lunar month.

The People's Liberation Army stationed between Lijiang and Lhasa pays close attention to protecting the merchants coming and going. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Tibetan people in the area bordering Yunnan and Xikang have also eliminated the disputes of "fighting enemies" that have existed for many years. Merchants traveling between Yunnan and Tibet enjoy unprecedented safety and convenience, and they unanimously expressed their gratitude to the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. The commerce of Lijiang City, where the Mosuo people live, is also prospering due to the trade between Yunnan and Tibet.

Changdu's Economy Has Flourished Since Liberation
Purchasing Power of the Tibetan People Greatly Increased

The economy of Changdu City in Xikang is gradually recovering. The thirty-eight leather workshops that were squeezed out by the dumping of goods by imperialists before liberation have all resumed and expanded production after receiving loans from the Changdu Office of the People's Bank of China. The leather boots produced by these workshops have now begun to be sold far away to Lhasa. The number of stores opened in Changdu City has increased more than three times compared to before liberation.

Since the liberation of Changdu, sideline production has increased, and the burden of corvée labor on the people has been reduced, thus greatly increasing the purchasing power of the Tibetan people. Li Zhifang, a Han merchant in the city who sells copper pots, only sold five pots in the years before liberation, but now the demand exceeds supply. The garment industry, which was previously considered a slow-moving business with a small turnover, sold more than 3,000 sets of clothes in the city last year alone, most of which were bought by Tibetan farmers and herdsmen.

Minority Nationalities in the Mountains of Western Yunnan
Gradually Migrate to Plains to Settle Down and Produce

The western border of Yunnan has vast intermountain plains, such as the Mangshi Dam, Yingjiang Dam, and Longchuan Dam, which are fertile places. The grain produced each year not only supplies the various ethnic groups in the mountainous areas but also has a large surplus for export. However, due to the ethnic disputes created by the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties and the prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria in the plains, the Lahu, Lisu, and other ethnic groups were forced to live in deep mountains and forests, leading a primitive and poor life. Because of the lack of land, they can only eat three to six months' worth of grain on average each year. The Dai and Yi people, who live in the plains, mostly choose fertile fields to cultivate because of the wide area and sparse population, and only plant one season (two seasons of rice can be planted locally each year), leaving many good fields uncultivated.

Since liberation, the People's Governments at all levels have correctly implemented the policy of national unity, eliminating the estrangement and disputes between the various fraternal ethnic groups in the mountains and on the plains. Since the spring of last year, a small number of Lahu and Lisu people have successively moved down to the plains to reclaim wasteland and cultivate the land. At the Bao Shan Special District People's Representative Conference in October last year, representatives of the Lahu and Lisu ethnic groups formally put forward the request to move down to the plains for production. After consultation among representatives of various ethnic groups, the People's Governments of Longchuan, Yingjiang, Ruili, and other counties have decided to make vigorously organizing and assisting the Lahu and Lisu people to move down to the plains for production one of their important tasks. Now, many new Lahu villages have been established on both sides of the Longchuan River.

Yi People in the Greater Liang Mountains Improve Farming Techniques
A State-Owned Farm Has Been Established in Zhaojue County

The Yi people living in the vast Greater Liang Mountains, because they were instigated by reactionary rulers before liberation, often had enemy disputes, which affected production, and their farming techniques had not been improved for a long time. After the liberation of this area, the People's Government first helped the Yi people establish the Autonomous Region People's Government in Zhaojue County, the center of the Greater Liang Mountains. With the help of the People's Government, many disputes within the Yi people were resolved, and the farmers were able to concentrate on production, and farming techniques were rapidly improved. This year, Yi farmers have begun to use new farm tools.

In order to help the Yi people improve agricultural production, the People's Government has successively issued a large number of loans for water conservancy, farm tools, fertilizers, and draft animals, and has also trained a group of Yi water conservancy cadres. At present, the People's Government is lending new farm tools to Yi farmers. Zhaojue County has also established a state-owned farm, which will lead the Yi people to further improve their farming techniques.

Qinghai Dulan Trading Company Trade Team
Deeply Engaged in Business in Tibetan Areas and Received Love

The Guoluo Tibetans originally lived in the Xingxiu Sea area, the source of the Yellow River at the northern foot of the Bayan Har Mountains. In 1919, in order to resist Ma Bufang's bloody rule, they were driven by Ma Bufang into the remote mountains and wilderness. From then until the liberation of Qinghai thirty years before, they were constantly subjected to the cruel massacre and long-term economic blockade by Ma Bufang, living a subhuman life of eating fern and drinking cow blood. In May last year, the state-owned trading branch of Dulan County, Qinghai Province, organized a joint state-private trading team and went to the remote Qumalai Guoluo Tibetan area for trade for the first time. In order to transport a large number of cloth, grass, grain, and other items to the tents of the Qumalai Tibetans, the trading team crossed the ice and snow-covered Kunlun Mountains and trekked more than 1,500 miles. The trading team was warmly welcomed by the Tibetans when they arrived in Qumalai. The Tibetans sent the wool accumulated for many years to the trading team to exchange for their daily necessities. Many Tibetans posted pictures of Chairman Mao and praised Chairman Mao's kindness.

Yunnan Buyi People Organize Mule and Horse Transportation Teams
Promote Material Exchange and Improve Their Lives

The three counties of Cheli, Fohai, and Nanqiao in Pu'er Prefecture, Yunnan Province, are located west of the Lancang River on the border of the motherland. The soil is fertile, the climate is good, and it is rich in cotton and rice. It has always been known as the granary of southern Yunnan. However, before liberation, due to traffic congestion and the presence of bandits everywhere, the people of all ethnic groups in the area did not dare to cross the Lancang River to the interior, so that the grain could not be transported out, and it had to be used to feed pigs or left to rot, wasting a lot of grain every year. The salt and other daily necessities needed by the local people could not be transported in either, so the local people of all ethnic groups lived a bland life for a long time.

After liberation, the bandits in this area have been wiped out. The Buyi people, who account for the largest population of the three counties, automatically organized mules, horses, and yaks in the winter of last year, and took advantage of the production gap to transport cotton and rice produced locally to Pu'er and Jinggu counties, five or six hundred miles away, and transport salt from the salt fields of Pu'er and Jinggu. The People's Government vigorously supports the mule and horse teams of the Buyi people and provides loans to those who lack capital. The People's Government also gives preferential treatment to mule and horse teams in the form of tax reductions and exemptions when purchasing salt. In the past, the price of salt in the area was very expensive. In Nanqiao County, five catties of rice were needed to buy one catty of salt. But by transporting rice to the Pu'er salt field, one catty of rice could be exchanged for three catties of salt. Therefore, the price difference between rice and salt in the area has now been greatly reduced, and people of all ethnic groups can eat enough salt. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：少数民族地区人民经济生活在上升中

    少数民族地区人民经济生活在上升中
    云南和西藏间贸易恢复正常
    规模接近抗日战争前的状况
    云南省和西藏间的贸易现已完全恢复正常。滞留拉萨的藏族、汉族商人，都先后到云南采购货物。他们的许多骡马队在去年十一月间就抵达云南西北部的商业中心丽江县，运到大批西藏土产如贝母、虫草、麝香、羊皮和氆氇等毛呢及其他货物共八百多驮，贸易规模已接近抗日战争前的状况。由于丽江国营贸易公司的协助，这些藏族汉族商人在销售和采购货物时都得到很大便利。目前正是春暖草长季节，这些商人正一面在丽江、下关等地赶备货物，一面按照往年惯例到云南鹤庆、洱源、邓川等县放牧骡马；一俟货齐马肥，即将向拉萨出发，赶往参加旧历八月半的拉萨贸易大集会。
    驻防在丽江、拉萨间的人民解放军，对来往客商十分注意保护。云南、西康接壤地带的藏族人民，在人民政府领导下也消除了多年来“打冤家”的纠纷。来往云南和西藏间的商人得到了历史上从未有过的安全和便利，他们对人民政府和人民解放军一致表示感谢。摩些族聚居的丽江城的商业，也因为云南、西藏贸易而繁荣。
    昌都解放以来经济日趋繁荣
    藏族人民购买力已大为提高
    西康昌都市经济正在逐步恢复中。解放前被帝国主义倾销商品挤倒的三十八家皮革作坊，得到了中国人民银行昌都办事处的贷款后，已经全部恢复并扩大了生产。这些作坊出产的皮靴现已开始远销拉萨。昌都市开业商店已较解放前增加了三倍以上。
    昌都解放后，副业生产增加，人民差役负担减轻，藏民购买力因而大为提高。该市汉族商人李之方经售的铜锅，解放前几年内只卖出五口，现在已供不应求。过去被认为冷货的成衣业，营业额很小，但是去年一年内，全市成衣业就卖出三千多套衣服，其中大部为藏族农、牧民买去。
    云南西部丛山中的少数民族
    陆续迁移到平坝上安家生产
    云南西部边境有广阔的山间平坝，像芒市坝、盈江坝和陇川坝都是富饶的地方，每年出产的粮食除供给山区各族人民吃用外，还有大量余粮出口。但由于历代反动统治者制造民族纠纷，平坝上又流行着疟疾等传染病，山头、傈僳等族人民被迫到深山丛林中去聚居，过着原始的贫苦生活。因为无地少地，他们每年平均只能吃三个月到半年的粮食。而聚居在平坝的傣族和彝族，因为地广人稀，多半选择肥田耕耘，并且只种一季（当地每年可种两季稻子），荒芜了很多良田。
    解放以后，各地人民政府正确执行了民族团结政策，消除了山区和平坝上各个兄弟民族之间的隔阂和纠纷。从去年春天起，便有少数山头、傈僳族人民陆续下坝开荒耕种。在去年十月保山专区各族人民代表会议上，山头、傈僳族代表又正式提出下坝生产的要求。经过各族人民代表协商后，陇川、盈江、瑞丽等县人民政府都决定把大力组织和帮助山头、傈僳族人民下坝生产列为重要工作之一。现在，陇川江两岸已建立起许多新的山头族村寨。
    大凉山区彝族改进耕作技术
    昭觉县已建立了国营农牧场
    居住在辽阔的大凉山区的彝族人民，在解放前因为受了反动统治者的挑拨，常闹冤家纠纷，影响了生产，在耕作技术上也长期得不到改进。该地区解放后，由于人民政府首先帮助彝族人民在大凉山区的中心——昭觉县建立了自治区人民政府，彝民内部的许多纠纷在人民政府的帮助下得到和解，农民都能安心生产，耕作技术也迅速改进，今年彝族农民已开始使用新农具。
    为了帮助彝族人民提高农业生产，人民政府先后发放了大量的水利、农具、肥料、耕畜等项贷款，并曾培养了一批彝族水利干部。目前，人民政府正在给彝族农民贷放新农具。昭觉县并已建立了一个国营农牧场，将领导彝族人民进一步改进耕作技术。
    青海都兰贸易公司贸易小组
    深入藏区开展业务受到热爱
    果洛藏民原居巴颜喀喇山北麓的黄河源头星宿海一带，一九一九年为了反抗马匪步芳的血腥统治，被马匪驱赶到深山荒野里去，从那时起一直到青海解放前的三十年中，他们不断遭受马匪的残酷屠杀和长期的经济封锁，过着吃厥麻喝牛血的非人生活。青海省都兰县国营贸易支公司，在去年五月组织了一个公私联合的贸易小组，首次深入到边远的曲麻莱果洛藏区进行贸易。贸易小组为了把大批的布、草、粮食等运送到曲麻莱藏民的帐篷里去，翻越了冰雪封冻的昆仑山，跋涉了一千五百多里。贸易小组抵达曲麻莱时，受到藏民热烈的欢迎。藏民们都把积存多年的羊毛送到贸易小组来，换取自己所需要的日用品。很多藏民把毛主席的像片贴起来，歌颂毛主席的恩德。
    云南僰族人民组织骡马运输队
    促进物资交流改善自己的生活
    云南省普洱专区车里、佛海、南峤三县位于澜沧江以西的祖国边境，土质肥沃，气候良好，盛产棉花和稻谷，素有滇南谷仓之称。但在解放前，因交通阻塞，到处土匪出没，该地的各族人民轻易不敢渡过澜沧江到内地来，以致谷米不能外运，只好用来喂猪或任其霉烂，每年都要浪费大量的粮食。而当地人民所需要的食盐和其他日用品，也不能运进去，因而当地的各族人民长期过着淡食生活。
    解放后，这个地区土匪已被肃清。占三县人口最多的僰族人民，在去年冬天，就自动把骡马和驮牛组织起来，趁生产间隙，把本地出产的棉花和米运到五六百里外的普洱、景谷两县，并从普洱和景谷的盐场运回食盐。人民政府大力支持僰族人民的骡马队，对缺少资本的发给贷款。骡马队在购盐时，人民政府还给予减免盐税的优待。过去该区盐价非常昂贵，在南峤县要五斤米才能买到一斤盐。但把米运到普洱盐场，一斤米就可换回三斤盐。因此，现在该区米盐差价已大为降低，各族人民已都可吃到足够的食盐了。（据新华社消息）
