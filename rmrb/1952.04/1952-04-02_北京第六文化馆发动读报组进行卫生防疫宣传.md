    Beijing Sixth Cultural Center Mobilizes Reading Groups for Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Propaganda
    Editor: Since the news of the American aggressors spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China was published, the masses in Guanxiang Street, Tenth District of Beijing, have expressed extreme indignation! However, some of the masses still lack sufficient understanding of the enemy's germ warfare. Some are indifferent, while others are panic-stricken. To address this, our cultural center held a symposium on March 18th with the leaders of all 52 reading groups in the street, mobilizing the reading groups to conduct widespread propaganda among the masses. At the meeting, Comrade Zhang, the head of the Propaganda Department of the Tenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, first gave a mobilization report on epidemic prevention. At the same time, he arranged for the reading groups to focus on studying materials related to anti-bacterial warfare during this period, and everyone decided to do the following three things: (1) Widely expose the heinous crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria; (2) Mobilize and assist the masses in doing a good job in hygiene and epidemic prevention; (3) Raise vigilance to prevent bad elements from spreading rumors.
    According to our recent inspection, the activities of the reading groups in the hygiene and epidemic prevention campaign have been successful. In order to educate the elderly women to pay attention to hygiene and epidemic prevention, the reading groups invited these elderly women to listen to the news everywhere, exposing the crimes of American imperialism and explaining the importance of hygiene and epidemic prevention. After listening to this propaganda, Aunt Wu, from No. 21 Shegutang, said to everyone she met: "The American devils are so hateful, they want to kill people alive, and they can't justify this anywhere!" Aunt Wu's home was originally very unclean, but these days she has been busy plugging rat holes, washing and scrubbing everywhere, and sprinkling lime inside and outside the yard. Aunt Wang from Xia San Tiao Hutong, who is the head of the reading group, has been very busy these days. She goes out to do propaganda every day after breakfast, checking the hygiene work of the reading group members. She said, "Our reading group members must take the lead in epidemic prevention, and first clean up our own homes as an example." Zhao, an old lady from the reading group at No. 71, Section 3 of the Barracks, cleaned her house spotlessly, added a wooden lid to the toilet, and even washed her big black cat with disinfectant. From the active participation of these elderly women in the hygiene and epidemic prevention campaign, it can be seen that the masses in Guanxiang Street, under the propaganda and mobilization of the reading groups, have been universally mobilized.

    北京第六文化馆发动读报组进行卫生防疫宣传
    编辑同志：自从美国侵略者在朝鲜及我国东北撒布细菌的消息发表后，北京市十区关厢街群众表示了极度的愤恨！但是，也还有一部分群众对敌人的细菌战认识不足，他们有的是漠不关心，有的是惶恐不安。为此，我们文化馆特在三月十八日召开了全街五十二个读报组长座谈会，发动读报组向群众进行广泛的宣传。会上首先由中共北京市第十区委会宣传部张部长作了防疫动员报告，同时布置了各读报组在这个时期内要着重学习有关反细菌战的材料，并由大家议决做好下面三件事：（一）广泛地向群众揭发美帝国主义撒布细菌的滔天罪行；（二）动员和协助群众做好卫生防疫工作；（三）提高警惕防止坏分子造谣。
    据我们最近检查，读报组在卫生防疫运动中的活动是有成绩的。为了教育那些老大娘们重视卫生防疫工作，读报组到处邀请这些老大娘来听报，揭露美帝国主义的罪行，说明要讲卫生和防疫的道理。赦孤堂二十一号吴大娘听了这些宣传，逢人便说：“美国鬼子真可恶，想把人活活的害死，这个道理到那里它也讲不清呵！”吴大娘家里原来是很不清洁的，这几天她却忙着堵老鼠洞，到处洗洗刷刷，院里院外也撒上石灰了。下三条胡同的王大妈，是读报组的负责人，这几天她可忙坏了，每天一吃完早饭就出去宣传，检查读报组员的卫生工作，她说：“我们读报组员要带头搞防疫，首先就要把自己家弄干净，做个样子。”营房三甲七十一号读报组的赵老太太，把自己的房子打扫得干干净净，厕所加了木盖，她养的一只大黑猫也用药水给洗了澡。从这些老大妈积极参加卫生防疫运动的情形，可以看出关厢街的群众在读报组的宣传鼓动下，已经普遍动起来了。
