    Hunan Machinery Factory Workers Improve Operating Methods to Increase Productivity

    Editor: In the Hunan Machinery Factory's foundry, the iron melting rate used to be at most 1:10 (one pound of coal melting ten pounds of iron), and usually only 1:7 or 8. The furnace worker, Du Pinghai, based on his more than ten years of experience, thought of ways to improve the iron melting rate. In the past, workers would break iron hammers into two pieces and throw them into the three-section furnace to melt, and they would also put coking coal into the furnace randomly. He knew this was not good enough. He broke the iron hammers into three pieces and sent them into the furnace. Because of the small volume, the iron melted faster. He then arranged the coking coal in an orderly manner around the furnace. Because the coal's firepower was concentrated, the iron naturally melted faster. Using these methods, he finally raised the iron melting rate to 1:15.1. The carpentry workshop's production task for March was to make four fitter's benches and wooden boxes for a nine-foot electric gantry planer. The two production teams in the workshop challenged each other to be the first to complete the task. They modified the sawing machine and simplified the sawing procedures. The entire workshop saved more than 1,400 work hours in one month. Fitter workshop workers Wang Shuliang and Chen Zhiqing used the "centrifugal lead casting method" to complete the assembly of twenty-five gantry planers ahead of schedule. This method increased production efficiency by three and a half times and also improved quality. Labor model Ye Cailin and other workers in the forging workshop created tools for manufacturing air compressor accumulators, replacing most of the physical labor. In the manufacture of eleven accumulators, they have already saved more than 900 work hours.

    湖南机械厂工人改进操作方法提高生产率
    编辑同志：湖南机械厂铸工间的化铁率过去最高是一比十（一斤煤化十斤铁），平常只有一比七或八。炉工杜平海根据他十多年的经验，想法提高化铁率。过去工人把铁锤断成两截，就扔到三节炉里去化了，往炉里放焦煤也是乱放一起。他知道这样做不够好。他把铁锤断成三截，送入炉内。因体积小，铁熔化得也快了。他再把焦煤有秩序地堆在炉的四周，因煤的火力集中，铁当然熔得就更快了。他用了这些方法，终于使化铁率上升到一比十五点一。木工间三月份的生产任务是做四张钳桌和装九呎电动龙门刨床的木箱子。车间两个生产班互相挑战，争先要完成任务。他们改装了锯木机，简化了锯木的手续。全车间一个月里节省了一千四百多个工时。钳工间工人王树良、陈志清利用“离心浇铅法”，提前完成装配二十五部龙门刨床的任务。这个方法提高生产效率三倍半，也提高了质量。锻工间劳动模范叶财林和其他工人，制成了制造空气压缩机的蓄气筒的工具，代替了大部分的体力劳动。在制造十一个蓄气筒中，他们已节省了九百多个工时。
