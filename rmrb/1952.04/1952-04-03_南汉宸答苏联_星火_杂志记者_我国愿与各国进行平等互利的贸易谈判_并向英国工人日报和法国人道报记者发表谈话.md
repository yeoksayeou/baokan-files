Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference, met with a reporter from the Soviet "Spark" magazine on March 29th and answered the reporter's questions regarding the International Economic Conference as follows:

Question: What are your expectations for the Moscow International Economic Conference?

Answer: We are willing to broadly exchange opinions with industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, trade union workers, cooperative workers, economists, and others from various countries at the International Economic Conference. We are prepared to conduct various trade negotiations with industrialists and businessmen from various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, with a view to signing various transaction contracts, agreements, and protocols. At the same time, we are willing to establish friendly contacts with attendees from various countries and adopt various means to establish and develop friendly economic cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of all countries. Doing so is not only in the interests of the Chinese people but also in the interests of the people of the world.

Question: What do you think is the significance of this conference for economic cooperation?

Answer: The Soviet Union, China, and the various People's Democratic countries are engaged in peaceful economic construction and have achieved brilliant successes. Some countries, however, are sinking into increasingly deep economic crises due to the implementation of arms expansion, embargoes, and blockades. The convening of the International Economic Conference will help develop international economic relations under conditions of world peace, abolish blockades and embargoes, and fully develop international trade, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in various countries. At the same time, it can also help those countries with economic crises extricate themselves from the crises, restore the production of peaceful industries, and gradually improve the living conditions of the people there. Therefore, the convening of the International Economic Conference has been warmly supported by the people of the world and will be a success.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. On March 27th, Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference, gave talks to Pike, the Moscow correspondent of the British "Daily Worker," and Coin, the Moscow correspondent of the French "L'Humanité," on the issues of Sino-British trade and Sino-French trade, respectively.

Head of Delegation Nan Hanchen said to Pike: China and Britain have a long history of trade relations. The Chinese people believe that Sino-British trade has a promising future. In the process of economic construction, China needs to buy many British industrial products, and at the same time, we can sell Britain products such as eggs, soybeans, bristles, and tung oil. We are willing to work with economists, industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, trade union workers, cooperative workers, etc. from Britain who are attending the International Economic Conference to jointly promote the development of Sino-British trade.

Head of Delegation Nan Hanchen said to Coin: China's trade with France and other Western European countries has broad prospects for development. In the process of economic construction, China needs to buy machinery, industrial raw materials, and other industrial products from France and other Western European countries, and at the same time, we can sell various products to France and other Western European countries. We are willing to work with economists, industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, trade union workers, cooperative workers, etc. from France and other Western European countries who are attending the International Economic Conference to jointly promote the development of Sino-French trade.

    【新华社莫斯科二日电】我国参加国际经济会议代表团团长南汉宸，在三月二十九日接见苏联“星火”杂志记者，对该记者所提出的关于国际经济会议的问题答复如下：
    问：您对莫斯科国际经济会议的期望如何？
    答：我们愿意在国际经济会议中与各国的工业家、商业家、农业家、工会工作者、合作社工作者、经济学者等，广泛交换意见。我们准备与各国的工商业家在平等互利的基础上进行各种贸易谈判，以期签订各种交易合同、协定、协议。同时我们愿意与各国出席人建立友好的联系，并采取各种方式，以建立和发展中国人民与各国人民之间的经济友好合作关系。这样做不仅是符合中国人民的利益，而且是符合世界人民利益的。

    答：苏联、中国及各人民民主国家正在进行和平的经济建设，并且都获得辉煌的成就。而有些国家却因实施扩张军备、封锁禁运，而陷入越来越深重的经济危机之中。国际经济会议的召开，将有助于在世界和平条件下发展国际经济关系，取消封锁与禁运，并充分开展国际间的贸易，发展各国工农业生产；同时还能帮助那些有经济危机的国家从危机中解脱出来，恢复和平工业的生产，并使那里的人民生活条件逐渐改善。因此国际经济会议的召开，已经获得全世界人民的热烈拥护，而且将获得成功。
