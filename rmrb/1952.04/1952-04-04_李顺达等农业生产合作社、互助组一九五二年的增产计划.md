    Li Shunda from Shanxi Province, Geng Changsuo from Hebei Province, Han En and Jin Shilong from Jilin Province, Lü Hongbin and Li Tianying (female) from Shandong Province, Su Dianxuan from Henan Province, and Pu Zhongzhi from Shaanxi Province are all nationally renowned model agricultural laborers. Their respective agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams, responding to the call of the Central People's Government, jointly issued a challenge to the entire nation to launch a patriotic production increase campaign. The main content of the increased production plans of these production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are briefly introduced below:

    Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative

    The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, was expanded and reorganized from a mutual aid team last winter. Xigou Village is located in a mountainous area with very little arable land. Therefore, in addition to agriculture, this cooperative also engages in forestry and animal husbandry. The cooperative has twenty households and 159.5 mu of arable land. Agriculture mainly involves planting corn, millet, and other miscellaneous grains.

    The main contents of Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative's increased production plan for this year include: 1. The average yield per mu of farmland for the entire cooperative will reach 423 jin, an increase of 53 jin compared to last year (an increase of 14.3%), which is 48 jin more than the average yield per mu stipulated in the village's increased production plan for this year. 2. On the cooperative's ten mu of high-yield land, five mu will be planted with "Golden Queen" corn, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; five mu will be planted with improved millet varieties, with a yield of 600 jin per mu. 3. Develop forestry and animal husbandry: afforest 100 mu in spring and autumn, planting 1,500 fruit trees and timber trees; plant pasture, purchase breeding livestock, and breed draft animals and sheep.

    Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative

    The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, was established during the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. The cooperative has a total of 25 households and 318 mu of arable land (converted to city mu). This production cooperative has a relatively long history. After its establishment, the production level has increased year by year. In 1951, the output increased by 100% compared to when the cooperative was first established in 1944. The cooperative is divided into three production teams: agriculture, oil pressing, and rope making, engaging in specialized division of labor and continuous production throughout the year. They use the income from sideline production to expand investment in agricultural production, enabling agricultural production to continuously develop.

    The main contents of Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative's increased production plan for this year include: 1. The average yield per mu of farmland for the entire cooperative will reach 571 jin, an increase of more than 140 jin compared to last year, and more than 380 jin more than the village's average annual yield per mu. 2. On the cooperative's 18 mu of high-yield land, five mu will be planted with cotton, with a yield of 650 jin per mu; six mu will be planted with millet, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; six mu will be planted with corn, with a yield of 800 jin per mu; one mu will be planted with sweet potatoes, with a yield of 8,000 jin. 3. Improve the soil and add livestock. The cooperative currently has 40 mu of sandy land, and this year will improve 20 mu by adding black soil; purchase one head of draft animal and nine pigs, increase manure accumulation, so that the average fertilizer application per mu of arable land reaches 3,900 jin.

    Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative

The cooperative has 22 households and 450 mu of arable land (each mu is equal to 1.5 city mu, the same for all Northeast mu below). The cooperative is divided into five production teams: new farm tools, old farm tools, paddy fields, sideline occupations, and animal husbandry, engaging in specialized division of labor and production. They are famous for their sideline production operations. Last year, their sideline income was greater than their agricultural income.

    The main contents of Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative's increased production plan for this year include: 1. The cooperative will sow: 120 mu of soybeans, with a yield of 500 jin per mu, an increase of 8.1% compared to last year; 120 mu of corn, with a yield of 600 jin per mu, an increase of 3.4% compared to last year; 50 mu of sunflower seeds, with a yield of 450 jin per mu, an increase of 12.5% compared to last year; 50 mu of rice, with a yield of 800 jin per mu, an increase of 2.5% compared to last year; 50 mu of millet, with a yield of 400 jin per mu, an increase of 14% compared to the average annual yield; 60 mu of vegetables, with a production value equivalent to 500 jin of soybeans per mu, an increase of 25% compared to last year. 2. On the cooperative's 45 mu of high-yield land, 20 mu will be planted with soybeans, with a yield of 600 jin per mu; 20 mu will be planted with corn, with a yield of 800 jin per mu; 5 mu of rice, with a yield of 1,100 jin per mu. 3. Develop animal husbandry and sideline occupations: the cooperative raised six dairy cows last year, and will raise 25 this year; raise 60 fattening pigs; produce 7,200 jin of vermicelli throughout the year; and strive to increase transportation income to 48 million yuan this year. 4. Establish a water conservancy committee within the cooperative to strengthen drought and flood prevention work.

    Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative

    The Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingcheng Village, Yanji County, Jilin Province, was formed by the union of five mutual aid teams in the spring of last year. The cooperative has 19 households and 492.7 mu of paddy and dry land. Last year, Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative was newly established. The rice yield per mu reached more than 770 jin, which was more than 10 jin more than the rice yield per mu of general mutual aid teams, and more than double that of individual households.
