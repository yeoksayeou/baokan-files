Launch a Patriotic Production Increase Campaign to Strive for a Greater Harvest This Year

    Many state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams led by nationally renowned labor models have jointly issued a challenge to farmers and state-owned farms across the country to engage in a patriotic production increase campaign. This large-scale challenge is the bugle call for the victorious advance of farmers nationwide on the agricultural production front. It is of great significance for increasing the per unit area yield of farmland, striving for a greater national harvest this year, completing this year's agricultural production plan, and promoting the development of agricultural production in the future.

    The main content of this patriotic production increase campaign is to comprehensively increase the yield of various crops, especially to create high per unit area yields of rice, wheat, and cotton. On our country's agricultural production front, if all farmers can meet the challenge conditions proposed by agricultural production cooperatives such as Li Shunda's to increase production by 10 percent, then this year's national agricultural production plan can be greatly overfulfilled; if 20 percent of the farmers nationwide planting rice meet the competition conditions proposed by mutual aid teams such as Chen Yongkang's to produce 1,600 jin of rice per mu; if 9 percent of the farmers nationwide planting wheat meet the competition conditions proposed by the Shi Anfu mutual aid team to produce 900 jin of wheat per mu; if 10 percent of the farmers nationwide planting cotton meet the challenge conditions proposed by mutual aid teams such as Qu Yaoli's to produce 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, then the total output of rice, wheat, and cotton nationwide will be doubled compared to last year's total output. This campaign can not only greatly increase the per unit area yield of farmland, but also further demonstrate the superiority of the collective production method of cooperation and mutual assistance. Through this campaign, the broad masses of farmers, especially those in new areas, will more personally experience the truth of Chairman Mao's instruction that "getting organized is the inevitable path from poverty to prosperity," which will more powerfully guide farmers who have not yet joined mutual aid teams onto this bright road from poverty to prosperity, and make the already organized mutual aid teams more developed, consolidated, and improved.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and governments at all levels, the productive forces in the liberated countryside are developing rapidly. The patriotic production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers is unprecedentedly high, and they are urgently demanding expanded reproduction. Therefore, to launch a vigorous and large-scale patriotic production increase campaign nationwide on the agricultural production front, under leadership, is completely in line with the patriotic production demands of the broad masses of farmers. Launching a patriotic production competition is one of the most important leadership methods for attracting the broad masses of farmers to participate in national construction, and it is also the most meaningful way of life for our country's working people. Last year, after the Li Shunda mutual aid team launched a production competition, more than one million mutual aid teams across the country participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition. During the competition, a large number of bumper harvest mutual aid teams, bumper harvest agricultural production cooperatives, and bumper harvest models emerged, creating amazing new records of bumper harvests for various crops. In areas where the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement was carried out well, agricultural production was significantly increased, mutual aid teams were widely developed, and a new outlook appeared in all aspects of rural work. For example, in Shanxi Province last year, more than 100,000 mutual aid teams participated in the production competition. Many mutual aid teams, in addition to taking increasing output as the main content of the competition, also put forward conditions such as comparing patriotism, comparing mutual assistance, comparing grain delivery and tax payment, comparing cultural learning, and comparing leadership style. The production competition not only promoted the production movement, but also promoted all aspects of rural work. The situation was the same in other areas where the competition movement was carried out better.

    This year, the conditions for carrying out a large-scale patriotic production increase campaign nationwide are even more mature. Areas with more than 300 million agricultural population nationwide have completed land reform, and the agricultural productive forces here have been liberated from the shackles of the feudal land system; agricultural areas that have not yet carried out land reform have also carried out democratic struggles such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and opposition to local tyrants; about one-quarter of the farmers nationwide have participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, providing a solid foundation for the competition; a large number of labor models and bumper harvest models have emerged in various places, providing a reliable backbone for the competition movement; in last year's competition movement, leading cadres and the masses at all levels have accumulated a lot of competition experience; since last winter, various places have planned to summarize the experience of patriotic bumper harvest models and promoted these experiences, rectified mutual aid teams, and conducted short-term training for labor models; some areas have also launched a patriotic bumper harvest competition movement of ten thousand teams and one thousand villages; recently, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government also rewarded a group of bumper harvest models that emerged last year, setting up flags in all aspects for farmers nationwide. Under these good conditions, as long as party organizations, people's governments, and agricultural affairs organs at all levels strengthen specific leadership and earnestly help farmers, this year's patriotic bumper harvest movement can undoubtedly be done well.

    Strengthening leadership over the patriotic production increase competition is the key to carrying out this competition movement extensively and deeply.

    1. Party organizations and people's governments at all levels must regard leading the competition as an important part of leading agricultural production. Each county must convene meetings of mutual aid team representatives, labor models, and bumper harvest models to specifically discuss and deploy the competition movement, and formulate specific goals and methods of inspection and evaluation in accordance with the specific conditions of each region. The organizations and individuals participating in the competition must be strengthened, guided, and helped to solve difficulties to ensure the completion of the competition plan. During the competition, inspections must be carried out frequently, and evaluations with different content must be carried out according to the needs of the season, which must be implemented until the autumn harvest summary. In last year's agricultural patriotic bumper harvest movement, some areas experienced the phenomenon of abandoning leadership, resulting in an unfinished end; this shortcoming must be prevented and corrected this year.

    2. Launching a patriotic production increase competition must be based on mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms, with labor models and bumper harvest models as the backbone, to attract the participation of the broad masses of farmers. In addition to organizing local state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and labor models to challenge equivalent organizations and individuals across the country, various places should also take these challenging organizations and individuals as the core to carry out local patriotic production increase competitions. This is the foundation of a large-scale patriotic production increase competition movement. During the competition, in addition to actively taking the lead in participating in the competition and completing their own competition plans, state-owned farms in various places should also technically help local mutual aid teams and farmers so that they can smoothly complete the competition conditions; it is necessary to mobilize mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places to actively respond to the challenge, so that the process of carrying out the competition will also become a process of developing, consolidating, and improving mutual aid teams.

    3. In the competition movement, it is necessary to strengthen the patriotic education of farmers, fully explain to farmers the significance and purpose of the patriotic production increase competition movement, and closely combine the competition movement with the current political movement. At the same time, it is necessary to specifically and deeply lead farmers to learn from the experience of bumper harvest models, cultivate and establish bumper harvest banners, and launch a mass movement to improve farming techniques. Only in this way can we give play to the creative spirit of the broad masses of farmers, and consolidate and enhance the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in carrying out the patriotic production increase competition.

    In order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and for the construction of the motherland, in this season of spring plowing, let all our farmers and all agricultural workers actively participate in the great patriotic production increase competition movement, and strive to generally increase the per unit area yield and create higher bumper harvest records!

### 开展爱国增产竞赛，争取今年更大的丰收

    开展爱国增产竞赛，争取今年更大的丰收
    许多国营农场和全国著名的劳动模范所领导的农业生产合作社和互助组，联名向全国农民和国营农场提出了爱国增产竞赛的挑战。这个大规模的挑战是全国农民在农业生产战线上胜利进军的号角。它对于提高农田的单位面积产量，争取全国今年更大的丰收，完成今年的农业生产计划和推动今后农业生产的发展，都有十分重大的意义。
    这次爱国增产竞赛的主要内容，是全面地提高各种农作物的产量，特别是创造水稻、小麦、棉花三种作物的高额的单位面积产量。在我国的农业生产战线上，如果全体农民都能达到李顺达等农业生产合作社所提出的增产一成的挑战条件，那末，今年全国的农业生产计划，就可以大大地超额实现；如果全国种植水稻的农民，有百分之二十达到陈永康等互助组所提出的每亩生产一千六百斤水稻的竞赛条件，如果全国种植小麦的农民有百分之九达到史安福互助组所提出的每亩生产九百斤小麦的竞赛条件，如果全国植棉的农民有百分之十达到曲耀离等互助组所提出的每亩生产一千斤籽棉的挑战条件，那末，全国水稻、小麦、棉花的总产量，都将比去年的总产量提高一倍。这次竞赛，不仅可以大大提高农田单位面积产量，而且可以进一步显示出合作互助的集体生产方式的优越性。经过这次竞赛，广大的农民，特别是新区的农民，更将亲身体验到毛主席指示的“组织起来是由穷变富必由之路”的真理，将更有力地引导还没有参加互助组的农民走上这条由穷变富的光明大道，并使已经组织起来的互助组，更加发展、巩固和提高。
    在共产党和各级人民政府的领导下，获得了解放的农村生产力，正在突飞猛进地向前发展。广大农民的爱国增产热情空前高涨，他们迫切地要求扩大再生产。因此，在全国范围内，在农业生产战线上，有领导地、大规模地开展一个轰轰烈烈的爱国增产竞赛运动，是完全适合于广大农民的这种爱国增产要求的。发动爱国生产竞赛，这是吸引广大农民参加国家建设的最重要的领导方法之一，也是我国劳动人民最有意义的生活方式。去年李顺达互助组发动生产竞赛后，全国有一百多万个互助组参加了爱国丰产竞赛。在竞赛过程中，出现了大批的丰产互助组、丰产农业生产合作社和丰产模范，创造了各种农作物的惊人的丰产新纪录。凡是爱国丰产竞赛运动开展得好的地区，那里的农业生产量就显著地提高了，互助组就广泛地发展了，农村各方面的工作，也出现了一种新面貌。例如山西全省去年有十万个以上的互助组参加了生产竞赛，许多互助组除了把提高产量作为竞赛的主要内容以外，还提出了比爱国、比互助、比交粮纳税、比文化学习、比领导作风等条件。生产竞赛不仅推动了生产运动，而且推动了农村各方面的工作。在竞赛运动开展得较好的其他地区，情形也是这样的。
    今年在全国范围内开展大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动，条件是更加成熟了。全国已有三亿以上农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，这里的农业生产力已经从封建的土地制度的桎梏下解放出来了；还没有进行土地改革的农业地区，也都进行了减租减息、反对恶霸等民主斗争；全国已有四分之一左右的农民参加了互助组和农业生产合作社，使竞赛有了巩固的基础；各地涌现出来了大批劳动模范、丰产模范，使竞赛运动有了可靠的骨干；在去年的竞赛运动中，各级领导干部和群众已经积蓄了不少竞赛经验；从去年冬天以来，各地有计划地总结了爱国丰产模范的经验，并且推广了这些经验，整顿了互助组，对劳动模范进行了短期训练；有一部分地区还开展了万组千村爱国丰产竞赛运动；最近中央人民政府农业部并奖励了去年出现的一批丰产模范，给全国农民树立了各方面的旗帜。在这些良好的条件下，各级党的组织、人民政府和农业事业机关，只要加强具体领导，认真帮助农民，今年的爱国丰产运动无疑地是可以作好的。
    加强对爱国增产竞赛的领导，是广泛地深入地开展这个竞赛运动的关键。
    一、各级党的组织和人民政府，必须把领导竞赛作为领导农业生产的重要环节。各县必须召开互助组代表、劳动模范和丰产模范的会议，具体讨论和布置竞赛运动，按照各个地区的具体情况，拟订竞赛的具体目标和检查、评比的办法。对参加竞赛的组织和个人，必须加强指导，帮助他们解决困难，保证完成竞赛计划。在竞赛过程中，必须经常进行检查，按照季节的需要，进行不同内容的评比，一直贯彻到秋收总结。去年农业爱国丰产运动中，有些地区曾经发生了放弃领导以致有头无尾的现象；这种缺点，今年必须加以防止和纠正。
    二、发动爱国增产竞赛，必须以互助组、农业生产合作社、国营农场为基础，以劳动模范和丰产模范为骨干，吸引广大农民群众参加。各地除应组织当地的国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和劳动模范向全国相当的组织和个人应战外，并应以这些应战组织和个人为核心，开展当地的爱国增产竞赛。这是大规模爱国增产竞赛运动的基础。在竞赛过程中，各地国营农场除了应积极带头参加竞赛，完成自己的竞赛计划外，还应从技术上帮助当地的互助组和农民，使他们顺利完成竞赛条件；应该发动各地互助合作组织积极应战，以便使开展竞赛的过程，同时成为发展、巩固和提高互助组的过程。
    三、在竞赛运动中，必须加强对农民的爱国主义的教育，充分向农民说明爱国增产竞赛运动的意义和目的，使竞赛运动与当前的政治运动密切结合。同时必须具体深入地领导农民学习丰产模范的经验，培养和树立丰产旗帜，开展群众性的改进耕作技术的运动。只有这样，才能发挥广大农民的创造精神，巩固和提高广大农民开展爱国增产竞赛的信心。
    为了响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，为了祖国的建设，在这春耕开始的季节，让我们全体农民，全体农业工作者，都积极地参加到伟大的爱国增产竞赛运动中来，为普遍提高单位面积产量，为创造更高的丰产纪录而奋斗！
