Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The three working groups of the International Economic Conference (Working Group on Developing International Trade, Working Group on Promoting International Economic Cooperation to Solve Social Problems, and Working Group on Problems of Underdeveloped Regions) continued their meetings on the 8th. Delegates from various countries continued to put forward many new proposals at these meetings.

    At the meeting of the Working Group on Developing International Trade, Albanian economist Spahu advocated the establishment of an institution to take over the work of the Initiating Committee of the International Economic Conference and to prepare for the convening of the second conference.

    Pakistani representative Haroon suggested taking all measures to facilitate mutual exchanges between business people from various countries.

    Czechoslovak representative Adamik suggested that the conference issue an appeal to industrialists, farmers, merchants, scientists, trade union leaders, all working people, and governments of all countries around the world, asking them to support and implement the recommendations of the International Economic Conference.

    Soviet representative Orlov pointed out in his speech that the trade and payments of many capitalist countries are often in deficit, gold and foreign exchange reserves are gradually depleted, and currency crises are becoming increasingly serious. Dollar aid cannot eliminate the serious economic difficulties that these countries have experienced after the war. The foreign trade of Western countries is being conducted under increasingly difficult conditions. On the other hand, the economic relations between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies are constantly strengthening. Close economic cooperation has enabled their trade with each other to increase rapidly in recent years, doubling between 1948 and 1950. According to the statements of representatives of these countries at the meeting, it is estimated that the average annual trade volume of these countries with Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia can be doubled or even two and a half times within two or three years. Undoubtedly, there is also great potential for the development of trade between all other countries in the world.

    At the meeting of the Working Group on Promoting International Economic Cooperation to Solve Social Problems, the speeches of delegates from various countries showed that the people of all countries hope to develop mutually beneficial international trade to solve the problems of unemployment, malnutrition, and other social ills in some countries.

    Paraguayan representative Acosta described the situation in Paraguay, which is economically enslaved by American monopoly capitalists. He said that Truman's Point Four program of so-called aid to underdeveloped countries is a plan to turn Paraguay into a colony. Acosta asked the delegates attending the meeting to condemn this plan, and said that the International Economic Conference has pointed out peaceful methods for consolidating and maintaining national independence and sovereignty for all countries in the world.

    Kuznetsov of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union then spoke. He said that when discussing how international trade affects living standards, the problem of unemployment should be given special attention. Restoring and expanding international economic relations can be very beneficial to reducing unemployment. The Soviet orders mentioned by Nesterov, Chairman of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce, alone can provide jobs for at least 1.5 million to 2 million people for three years. If their family members are included, this is an opportunity to guarantee the lives of approximately 6 million people. Kuznetsov also supported the opinions expressed by many people at the meeting in favor of stopping the expansion of armaments and reducing military expenditures. He said that the money freed up by reducing military expenditures could be used to meet the immediate needs of working people, thereby further reducing unemployment.

    Italian representative Amaduzzi and American trade union leader Daisy both spoke about the unemployment problem in their countries. Daisy pointed out that as long as the United States trades with the world, the American people can be fully employed. He believed that the United States should lift trade restrictions on Eastern European countries and China, and suggested that another economic conference be held next year.

    Trade union leaders from Albania, Romania, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries listed many facts at the meeting to illustrate the recovery and development of their national economies and cultures, as well as the government's concern for the welfare of the people. They also pointed out that restoring trade between the East and the West would help eliminate unemployment in capitalist countries and improve people's living standards.

    Representatives from Argentina, Uruguay, Iran, Burma, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and other countries also spoke at the meeting. They advocated developing international economic cooperation and expanding world trade as a way to increase the happiness of people in all countries.

    The Working Group on Problems of Underdeveloped Regions continued to discuss the possibility of developing international trade on an equal and mutually beneficial basis in order to accelerate the economic development of underdeveloped countries.

    Korean Democratic People's Republic representative Yoon Hang-joong advocated developing trade relations on the principle of cooperation and mutual respect for interests, and suggested the establishment of an international organization responsible for providing technical assistance to underdeveloped countries.

    Iranian merchant Dariush suggested finding ways to eliminate all restrictions in international trade and establishing an international bank "to end the control of industrialized countries over underdeveloped countries in monetary terms." He suggested aiding underdeveloped countries by supplying them with basic construction equipment and other goods through long-term credit without any political conditions attached.

    Representatives from Hungary, Albania, Italy, Chile, India, Canada, and other countries also discussed the possibility of developing trade with underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Near East.

    Using the great achievements of the Soviet Union's Uzbek Republic after the October Revolution as an example, Polisenko, Vice Chairman of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce, explained the great significance of industrialization for the economies of underdeveloped countries. He also pointed out that Soviet industry is capable of supplying the machinery and equipment needed by the industrial, transportation, and agricultural sectors of underdeveloped countries. Soviet trade organizations are also willing to supply these countries with other goods they need, and are willing to accept the currencies of these countries when selling goods to them and use these currencies to purchase materials in these countries. Polisenko concluded by saying that the Soviet Union's expansion of trade with economically underdeveloped countries on a reciprocal basis will undoubtedly promote international economic cooperation and promote the cause of defending world peace.

    The working group finally elected a drafting committee to study the various suggestions put forward by everyone and to draft a report to be submitted to the plenary session of the International Economic Conference.

    国际经济会议继续举行工作小组会议
    各国代表提出许多发展贸易建议
    并主张建立机构保持联系继续大会工作
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际经济会议的三个工作小组（发展国际贸易工作小组、促进国际经济合作解决社会问题工作小组和落后地区问题工作小组）在八日继续举行会议。各国代表们继续在这些会议上提出了许多新的建议。
    在发展国际贸易工作小组会议上，阿尔巴尼亚经济学家斯巴胡主张成立一个机构，接替国际经济会议发起人委员会的工作，并筹备召开第二次会议事宜。
    巴基斯坦代表哈隆建议采取一切措施以便利各国企业界人士相互往来。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表阿达迈克建议大会向世界各国工业家、农业家、商人、科学家、工会领袖、全体劳动人民和各国政府发出呼吁，要求他们支持并实现国际经济会议的建议。
    苏联代表奥尔洛夫在发言中指出：许多资本主义国家的贸易和支付经常处于逆差的状态，黄金和外币存底逐渐耗竭，货币危机愈来愈严重。美元援助也不能消除这些国家战后发生的严重的经济困难。西方各国的对外贸易正在愈来愈困难的情况下进行。另一方面，苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家彼此之间的经济关系，正在不断地加强。密切的经济合作，使它们近年来彼此的贸易迅速增加，在一九四八到一九五○年间就增加了一倍。根据这些国家代表们在会议上的发言，估计这些国家对西欧、美洲、东南亚、中东、非洲和澳洲的每年平均贸易额，在两三年内可以增加到现在的两倍乃至两倍半，无疑地，全世界其他国家之间的贸易，也是有很大发展前途的。
    在促进国际经济合作解决社会问题工作小组会议上，各国代表们的发言表明，各国人民都希望发展互利的国际贸易，以解决某些国家中失业、营养不良以及其他社会病态的问题。
    巴拉圭代表阿科斯塔叙述了巴拉圭在经济上受美国垄断资本家奴役的情况。他说：杜鲁门的所谓援助落后国家的第四点计划，对于巴拉圭来说，就是变巴拉圭为殖民地的计划。阿科斯塔要求参加会议的代表们斥责这个计划，并说：国际经济会议给全世界一切国家指出了巩固并保持民族独立和主权的和平方法。
    全苏工会中央理事会库兹涅佐夫接着发言。他说：在讨论国际贸易如何影响生活水准的问题时，失业问题应该予以特别的注意。恢复和扩大国际经济关系可以非常有利于减少失业。仅仅制造全苏商会主席奈斯特洛夫所谈到的苏联订货一项，就至少可以使一百五十万到二百万人在三年中有工作做。如果把他们的家庭成员计算在内，这就是一个可以保证大约六百万人的生活的机会。库兹涅佐夫并支持许多人在会上发表的赞成制止扩张军备和削减军事开支的意见，他说：由于削减军费而腾出来的钱，可以用于满足劳动人民的切身需要，因此又可进一步减少失业。
    意大利代表阿马杜齐和美国工会领袖戴溪都谈到本国失业问题。戴溪指出：只要美国和全世界进行贸易，美国人民就可以充分就业。他认为美国应当取消对于东欧各国和中国的贸易限制，并建议明年再召开这样的经济会议。
    阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国等国工会领袖们，在会上列举了许多事实，说明本国经济文化的恢复和发展的情况，以及政府对人民福利的关怀。他们并指出：恢复东西双方的贸易有助于消灭资本主义国家失业现象和改善人民的生活状况。
    在会上发言的还有阿根廷、乌拉圭、伊朗、缅甸、英国、巴基斯坦及其他国家的代表。他们主张以发展国际经济合作和扩大世界贸易，作为增进各国人民幸福的方法之一。
    落后地区问题工作小组会议继续讨论了在平等、互利的基础上发展国际贸易，以便加速发展落后国家的经济的可能性。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表尹行重在发言中主张在合作和互相尊重利益的原则下发展贸易关系，并建议成立一个国际机构，负责对落后国家进行技术援助。
    伊朗商人达里奥契建议设法消除国际贸易中的一切限制，成立国际银行“以结束工业发达国家在货币方面对落后国家的控制”。他建议援助落后国家，以不附带任何政治条件的长期赊账的办法，向它们供应基本建设设备和其他货物。
    匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、意大利、智利、印度、加拿大和其他国家的代表，也谈论了发展对东南亚、中东和近东的落后国家的贸易的可能性。
    全苏商会副主席波里森科以苏联的乌兹别克共和国在十月革命后的伟大成就为例，说明工业化对于落后国家的经济的重大意义。他并指出：苏联工业能够供应落后国家的工业、运输和农业部门所需要的机器和装备。苏联贸易机构也愿意供应这些国家所需要的其他货物，而且愿意在卖东西给这些国家时收受这些国家的货币，并用这些货币在这些国家里购买物资。波里森科最后说：苏联和经济落后的国家在互惠的基础上扩大贸易，无疑地将能促进国际的经济合作，促进保卫世界和平的事业。
    小组会议最后选出了起草委员会，以研究大家提出的各种建议，并草拟向国际经济会议全体会议提出的报告。
