    Suggest Checking and Banning Fake Medicines that Harm Children

    Editor: After reading Comrade Gu Xiaolan's article "Let All the Mothers Under Heaven Accuse!" on the third page of your newspaper on March 28th, I further recognized the vicious faces of capitalists who only seek profit.

    As far as I know, although *zhegu cai* (Cantonese Lettuce) is no longer allowed to be produced, there are still a lot of stocks in pharmacies everywhere, and the masses do not know enough about its toxicity. Therefore, I suggest that the health authorities in all cities and towns should immediately conduct inspections and ban the sale of various fake medicines that harm children. Every comrade should conduct extensive publicity among the people, exposing the bourgeoisie's vicious methods of poisoning children. Shao Haoming

    建议各地检查和禁售暗害儿童的假药
    编辑同志：当我在你报三月二十八日第三版上读了顾小岚同志“让普天下的母亲们都来控诉吧”一文后，我进一步认识了唯利是图的资本家的恶毒面目。
    据我所知，鹧鸪菜虽然已不准再生产，但现在各地药店里的存货还很多，同时群众对它的毒害性也还不够了解。因此，我建议各城镇的卫生机关应即进行检查，禁止售卖各种残害儿童的假药。每一个同志都应在人民群众中进行广泛的宣传，揭露资产阶级毒害儿童的恶毒手段。　邵浩明
