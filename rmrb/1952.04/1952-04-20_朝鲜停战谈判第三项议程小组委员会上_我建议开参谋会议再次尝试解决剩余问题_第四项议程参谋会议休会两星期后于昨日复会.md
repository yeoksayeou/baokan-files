Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 19th: At the Korean Armistice Talks Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting, our side suggested reconvening staff meetings to attempt to resolve all remaining issues on the third agenda. Our representative pointed out: "(1) Because your side continues to insist on your unreasonable demand to restrict airfield facilities at the staff meetings and refuses to discuss and resolve this issue, our side suggests convening a subcommittee meeting to resolve all remaining issues on the third agenda together.

(2) It has been more than two weeks since the Third Agenda Subcommittee reconvened, and our side's position on the remaining issues on the third agenda is very clear. On the issue of neutral nation nominations, our side has already proposed three countries that fully meet the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Our side has also clearly suggested that both sides simultaneously and in one go agree to all neutral nation nominations proposed by the other side, or that both sides each nominate three neutral countries without any approval procedures. As for your side's so-called restriction of airfield facilities within Korea, our side has long and unequivocally pointed out that this unreasonable demand, which attempts to interfere in our internal affairs, is absolutely unacceptable to our side.

(3) However, your side continues to insist on this unreasonable demand at the subcommittee, so that the subcommittee has not made any progress since its reconvening. Given that your side has indicated that you do not object to referring the neutral nation nomination issue and the so-called restriction of airfield facilities and other issues to staff for discussion, our side suggests reconvening staff meetings from April 20th to allow the staff of both sides to once again attempt to find a solution to all remaining issues on the third agenda." Both sides agreed to convene staff meetings starting on April 20th.

The Fourth Agenda Staff Meeting temporarily adjourned from April 5th to allow both sides to explore additional avenues for discussing existing issues on the fourth agenda during the recess, for a total of two weeks, and reconvened today. The staff of both sides continued to exchange views at today's meeting on the basis of past discussions between the two sides.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    我建议开参谋会议再次尝试解决剩余问题
    第四项议程参谋会议休会两星期后于昨日复会
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方建议重行召开参谋会议尝试解决第三项议程的一切剩余问题。我方代表指出：“（一）由于你方在参谋会议上继续坚持你方的限制机场设备的无理要求，并拒绝讨论与解决这一问题，因此我方建议召开小组委员会议，将第三项议程的剩余问题一并予以解决。
    （二）第三项议程小组委员会复会以来已超过两星期，我方在第三项议程所剩余的问题上的立场，是非常清楚的。在中立国提名问题上，我方已经提出了三个完全合乎双方协议的中立国定义的国家参加中立国监察委员会。我方并明确建议双方同时并一次同意对方所提出的全部中立国提名，或是双方各自提名三个中立国家，而不进行任何同意手续。至于你方所提出的所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备问题，我方早已明确地不可动摇地指出，这种企图干涉我方内政的无理要求，是我方绝对不能考虑的。
    （三）但你方却在小组委员会上继续坚持这一无理要求，以致小组委员会复会以来，至今未能获得任何进展。鉴于你方表示，你方并不反对将中立国提名问题与所谓限制机场设备等问题交由参谋人员讨论。我方建议自四月二十日起重新召开参谋人员会议，让双方参谋人员对于第三项议程所剩余的一切问题再次尝试寻求解决。”双方同意在四月二十日起召开参谋会议。
    第四项议程参谋会议自四月五日起暂时休会，以便双方在休会期间增辟讨论第四项议程现存问题的途径，共休会两周，今天复会。双方参谋人员在本日会议中在双方过去讨论的基础上继续交换意见。
