Introducing the Soviet Educational System and Methods for Training Technical Workers
Li Shusen, Director of the Department of Secondary Technical Education, Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government

    To train technical workers and continuously supply a sufficient number of technical workers to the needs of various economic construction departments is an important condition for increasing production and developing industry.

    In order to increase production, it is necessary to increase labor productivity. The increase in labor productivity not only requires workers to fully exert their consciousness and enthusiasm in labor, but also requires workers to master advanced technology. Because only when workers master advanced technology can they fully apply advanced technology in production, and use the wisdom of the working class and the creativity and inventions of the broad masses to improve working methods, improve production processes, and improve production technology. To develop industry, it is not only necessary to expand existing industrial and mining enterprises, but also to establish new and larger industrial and mining enterprises, which requires a large number of technical workers, which cannot be completely solved by transferring a small number of workers from existing or other industrial and mining enterprises.

    How to improve the technical level of existing workers and train a large number of technical workers in their work? This is a very important issue at present. It is hoped that relevant parties will refer to the Soviet experience, comprehensively study the creations made in this work in various places over the past few years, affirm the good experiences, and gradually systematize and institutionalize them.

    Regarding ensuring a continuous supply of a sufficient number of technical workers to the needs of various economic construction departments, the Soviet Union has a complete education system and methods, which are worth our attention as a reference for our work. The introduction is as follows:

    The Soviet Union began to train technical workers after the victory of the October Revolution. In 1920, the Soviet government passed a resolution on establishing "factory apprentice schools," affirming that factory apprentice schools are the most important form of training technical workers. It can train technical workers who master advanced production technology, have the necessary scientific and theoretical knowledge, and have cultural accomplishments. In 1928, the first Stalin Five-Year Plan began, requiring the reconstruction of industry on a new technical basis. Factory apprentice schools were further developed. By 1930, more than 300,000 technical workers were being trained in factory apprentice schools. Later, with the progress of industrial construction, many huge construction projects began, and the need for skilled technical workers became more and more urgent. At this time, it was necessary to have a special organization to lead the work of training technical workers, so a Labor Reserve Bureau was established under the Soviet Council of Ministers. During the third Five-Year Plan, industry developed further, and the mechanization of the labor process was further strengthened. Therefore, the requirements for supplementing the working class with young people who are proficient in technology, have a higher level of education, and are more disciplined are even more urgent. Therefore, in 1940, according to Stalin's instructions to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet government established the Ministry of Labor Reserves on the basis of the original Labor Reserve Bureau.

    The task of the Ministry of Labor Reserves is to ensure that all sectors of the national economy, especially major economic sectors such as metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, coal, construction, railways, transportation, and transportation, have sufficient labor, that is, sufficient skilled young technical workers. It unifies enrollment and allocation according to the national construction plan, trains young technical workers according to the actual needs of various economic sectors in terms of business, and allocates them to various economic sectors according to different technical characteristics. At present, there are more than 3,000 schools under the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of Labor Reserves, with 500,000 students, training 90 different types of young workers. In the ten years since its establishment, the Ministry of Labor Reserves has supplied the country with 5.5 million skilled technical workers. The schools of the Ministry of Labor Reserves have become a source for supplementing the various sectors of the national economy with skilled young technical workers.

    The most important of the schools under the leadership of the Ministry of Labor Reserves that train technical workers are the following four types:

    (1) Apprentice Schools: The study period is six to ten months. Enrollment is once per period. The target of enrollment is young men and women aged 16 to 18 with two to three years of education, mainly to train general technical workers for industrial and mining enterprises.

    (2) Technical Schools: The study period is two years. Enrollment is once per academic year. The target of enrollment is young men and women aged 14 and above with four or five years of education (at present, many students in this type of school are young people who have completed seven years of education), mainly to train workers with more complex skills, such as fitters, turners, grinders, quenchers, train drivers, dredger drivers, telephone operators, telegraph operators, laboratory workers, and drillers in steel, machinery manufacturing, postal and telecommunications, railway and other enterprises.

    (3) Craft Technical Schools: The study period is three years. Enrollment is once per academic year. The target of enrollment is young men and women aged 16 and above with four or five years of education, mainly to train technical workers who manufacture tables, chairs, furniture, and architectural patterns, decorations, carving, and wall engraving.

    (4) Orphan Technical Schools: The study period is four years, specializing in enrolling orphans aged 12 and above with four years of education. This is a type of technical school established in 1943 according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. When orphans graduate, in addition to obtaining specialized skills to work as technical workers, they also complete seven years of schooling.

    In addition, there are schools with a study period of seven years, such as railway schools and mining schools. When students graduate, they have completed secondary technical education. They are no longer general technical workers, but intermediate technical cadres.

    In the four types of schools under the leadership of the Ministry of Labor Reserves mentioned above, except for orphan technical schools, the main course is technical education. Technical courses and internships account for about three-quarters of the total teaching time. Generally, there are only three subjects in the technical course: (1) Specialized Technology, the content is specialized technology, such as fitter or quencher; (2) Materials Science, the content is to identify the properties of various materials used in labor; (3) Drawing. General courses include physics, mathematics, Russian, literature, Soviet history, and physical education. General courses account for only one-quarter of the total teaching time, mainly to improve students' knowledge level so that they can master technology.

    For example, the teaching plan of a technical school is: (1) Technical course: 292 hours of specialized technology, 138 hours of drawing, 60 hours of materials science. (2) Production internship, 2,219 hours. (3) General courses: 207 hours of mathematics, 138 hours of physics, 190 hours of Russian, 160 hours of history, and 160 hours of physical education. The above three total 3,564 hours.

    These schools have their own internship factories. Classes and internships are mostly conducted on alternate days. Classes are generally six hours per day. Internships are generally six hours per day in the first year, seven hours per day in the first half of the second year, and eight hours per day in the second half of the second year, interning on the lathes in the factory's workshop. Gradually increasing the internship time is to cultivate students' labor habits.

    The characteristic of these schools' learning is that students learn on the one hand and produce various finished products necessary for the national economy on the other hand. Their education plan is directly related to the production of these finished products, that is, completed in the production of these finished products. Therefore, these schools can not only train a large number of skilled technical workers, but also repair and manufacture a large number of tools, parts, and machines. In the ten years since the establishment of the Soviet Ministry of Labor Reserves, the schools under the Ministry of Labor Reserves have manufactured 3,000 various lathes; repaired 11,000 locomotives and 100,000 carriages; 10,000 tractors and combine harvesters; During the Patriotic War, they also manufactured 6 million landmines and 26 million military parts; manufactured printing presses for guerrillas, field radio stations, periscopes for the navy, lifeboats for maritime flights, and a very large number of various appliances necessary for the national economy. Therefore, during the war, five schools won national medals, and twenty-five students were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. After the war, these schools also played a significant role in the recovery of the national economy.

    The students of these schools, like the workers of industrial and mining enterprises, also carry out socialist competition campaigns. The content of the competition is how to organize learning better, take good care of the tools and machines used in the internship, strive to produce excellent finished products in the internship, and complete the order tasks ahead of schedule. The competition is summarized once per season, and outstanding students are rewarded.

    These schools are all connected with certain industrial and mining enterprises, or are attached to industrial and mining enterprises. Industrial and mining enterprises help the schools in various aspects: such as helping to equip the schools with highly skilled workers as foremen, helping to find teachers for technical courses, helping to solve the school building problem, helping to enrich the equipment of the internship factory, and even helping to order production for the internship. For all this help, the schools give a certain price, for example, the factory supplies lathes for the internship, and the school pays at a discounted price; the wages of the foremen and technical course teachers are paid by the school. Engineers, technicians, and Stakhanov workers from industrial and mining enterprises often come to the school to give lectures, reports, or technical performances. The principals, vice-principals, and teachers of the school and the engineers, technicians, and advanced workers of the industrial and mining enterprises jointly organize a technical education committee to study the teaching content and teaching methods of technical education. Eighty percent of the workers in a factory in Moscow are graduates of a technical school attached to the factory. The relationship between the two parties is very close, simply an inseparable unity. Students are accustomed to being workers of the factory during their studies, and the factory also regards the school as an integral part of itself.

    The principals of these schools are usually selected from the Party's organization and administrative leading cadres. There are two or three vice-principals: one is responsible for academic affairs (mostly with higher technical education); one is responsible for political and ideological education (mostly graduates of Party schools or Marxism-Leninism colleges); and the other is responsible for general affairs (the chief foreman is also mostly with higher education). Students are divided into classes of twenty to twenty-five people. The class has a foreman (the foreman must be proficient in technology, he is often a highly skilled seventh-grade technical worker, or a graduate of a secondary technical school). In technical schools with more complex skills, a class is formed with twelve or thirteen people. The foreman is fixed to a certain class until the students in that class graduate.

    These schools also pay special attention to students' political and ideological education, so that they become excellent Soviet citizens and conscious builders of the cause of communism. Therefore, one counselor is assigned to every hundred students. The foreman is also responsible for conducting political and ideological education for the students.

    These schools are also very concerned about the health of students and attach importance to physical education. Each school has various mass sports organizations. Last year, a technical school won the wrestling championship; in 1951, students from some technical schools went to Prague to participate in sports performances.

    These schools have Party and Communist Youth League organizations; there are clubs, libraries, and young technicians' research rooms, etc. Students mostly engage in various activities after class, such as dancing, singing, playing chess, skating, acting, and participating in various technical representative conferences and their evening parties in the local area. Among the students, there are not only young technicians, but also young writers and young drawing artists.

    The teachers of these schools are mostly full-time. Only a few teachers are concurrently employed by engineers and technicians from industrial and mining enterprises. The school organizes the foremen and teachers to study business, or invites educators and experts to the school to give reports. All the one hundred and ten staff members of a technical school in Moscow are studying in the correspondence departments or night schools of colleges, secondary technical schools, or Marxism-Leninism colleges.

    The technical course textbooks of these schools have unified national regulations, and the general course textbooks are also different from those of general schools.

    These schools adopt extensive publicity and mobilization methods when recruiting new students, such as printing and distributing propaganda posters and letters to young people, organizing various report meetings and exhibitions, and holding parent meetings, so that students can voluntarily register after understanding the learning situation and learning conditions of each school. Students' tuition fees are entirely borne by the state. Food and clothing are provided free of charge. Students receive uniforms, work clothes, shoes, socks, shirts, daily necessities, stationery, and textbooks issued by the state; students from other places are also provided with clean and comfortable dormitories. Students can get about one-third of the value of the finished product as wages for their internship production.

    These schools require students to complete the quota of the production work they will be responsible for three months before graduation. Students have year-end examinations during normal times; they have national examinations at graduation. Students are generally rated as fourth-grade or fifth-grade workers after the national examination (if they are third-grade, they fail), and receive a certificate.

    Graduates are uniformly assigned by the Ministry of Labor Reserves. Although the school is attached to a certain industrial and mining enterprise, and the students also intern in that certain industrial and mining enterprise, the students are not necessarily sent to work in that industrial and mining enterprise immediately after graduation. However, the Ministry of Labor Reserves generally takes care of the needs of the industrial and mining enterprise first when assigning students, and then makes unified adjustments. The fact that 80 percent of the workers in a factory in Moscow mentioned above are graduates of the technical school attached to the factory is a clear example.

    The Ministry of Labor Reserves has all the conditions to carry out the work of training technical workers: it has sufficient funds; it has internship factories that meet actual needs and various modern equipment; it has a specialized organization for compiling various textbooks; it has its own publishing agency, publishing more than a hundred types of textbooks; it has its own several secondary technical schools (only accepting graduates from schools under the Ministry of Labor Reserves as students), training foreman talents for its schools; it has its own several specialized colleges (under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education), training teachers for technical courses; it has a specialized sports college, training sports teachers; it has its own scientific research institute, responsible for studying the ever-developing science and technology; it has a teaching method research office, studying teaching work, formulating plans for classes and internships every month for schools in various places to use, and the plan specifically points out what new technologies each school should learn and what new working methods should be adopted.

    The Ministry of Labor Reserves is very concerned about the correct use and proper development of graduates. It has a national inspection office, specifically responsible for maintaining close contact with graduates and inspecting whether the use of graduates assigned to various industrial and mining enterprises and units is appropriate.

    To help students learn technology and improve the technical level of school staff, the Ministry of Labor Reserves publishes two magazines: one is called "Production Education" and the other is called "Knowledge is Power."

    The Ministry of Labor Reserves maintains close contact with relevant economic departments and trade unions, and obtains their necessary assistance.

    介绍苏联培养技术工人的教育制度和办法
    中央人民政府教育部中等技术教育司司长  李曙森
    培养技术工人，源源不断地以足够数量的技术工人供应各经济建设部门的需要，是增加生产发展工业的重要条件。
    为了增加生产，必须提高劳动生产率。而劳动生产率的提高，不仅需要工人充分发挥劳动的自觉性和积极性，还需要工人掌握先进技术。因为只有工人掌握了先进技术，才能在生产中充分运用先进技术，并以工人阶级的智慧，广大群众的创造和发明，改善工作方法，改进生产过程，提高生产技术。为了发展工业，不但需要扩大原有工矿企业，还需要建立新的规模更大的工矿企业，这就需要大量的数目众多的技术工人，而不是从原有的或其他的工矿企业抽调少数工人可以完全解决问题的。
    怎样提高现有工人技术水平，在工作中培养大量技术工人呢？这在目前是个很重要的问题，希望有关方面参照苏联的经验，把各地几年来在这一工作上的创造，全面地加以研究，把好的经验肯定下来，并使之逐渐系统化制度化。
    关于保证源源不断地以足够数量的技术工人供给各经济建设部门的需要，苏联有一套完整的教育制度和办法，很值得我们注意，作为我们工作上的参考。现介绍如下：
    苏联在十月革命胜利后，就着手进行培养技术工人的工作。一九二○年，苏维埃政府通过了一个关于创办“工厂艺徒学校”的决定，肯定了工厂艺徒学校是培养技术工人的最重要形式。它可以培养出掌握先进生产技术，具有必要的科学理论知识，有修养的技术工人。一九二八年开始了斯大林第一个五年计划，要求在新的技术基础上改建工业，工厂艺徒学校就有了进一步的发展，到一九三○年，在工厂艺徒学校里培养着的技术工人已达三十多万。以后随着工业建设的进展，许多巨大的建设工程开始，对熟练技术工人的需要愈益迫切，此时需要有专门机构领导培养技术工人的工作，所以在苏联部长会议下设立了一个劳动后备局。第三个五年计划时期，工业更发展了，劳动过程的机械化也更加强了，因而以精通技术、文化程度较高、纪律性较强的青年，补充工人阶级队伍的要求也更迫切了，所以一九四○年根据斯大林在最高苏维埃主席团的指示，苏联政府在原有劳动后备局的基础上成立了劳动后备部。
    劳动后备部的任务，是保证国民经济的各部门，特别是各主要经济部门如冶金、机器制造、煤炭、建筑、铁路、交通、运输等，有足够的劳动力，即有足够的熟练的青年技术工人。它按照国家建设计划统一计划招生和分配，按照各经济部门业务上的实际需要培养青年技术工人，并按照不同技术性质分配给各经济部门。目前苏联劳动后备部所领导的学校有三千所以上，在校学生五十万人，培养着九十种不同技术的青年工人。劳动后备部在成立以来的十年中，已供给国家以五百五十万的熟练技术工人。劳动后备部的学校已成为补充国民经济各部门所需要的熟练青年技术工人的源泉。
    劳动后备部所领导的培养技术工人的学校，最主要的有下列四种：
    （一）艺徒学校：学习期限是六个月到十个月。每期招生一次。招生对象是十六岁到十八岁，具有二年到三年文化程度的男女青年，主要是培养工矿企业的一般技术工人。
    （二）技工学校：学习期限是二年，每学年招生一次，招生对象是年龄在十四岁以上，具有四年或五年文化程度的男女青年（目前这类学校的学生有不少是已完成七年教育的青年），主要是培养技术较复杂的工人，如钢铁、机器制造、邮电、铁路等企业的钳工、旋工、洗工、淬火工、火车司机、挖泥机司机、电话员、电报员、化验工人、钻井工人等。
    （三）工艺技工学校：学习期限为三年，每学年招生一次。招收十六岁以上具有四年或五年文化程度的男女青年，主要是培养制造桌椅、家具及建筑上的图案、装饰、挖花、刻墙等技术工人。
    （四）孤儿技工学校：学习期限是四年，专门招收十二岁以上具有四年文化程度的孤儿。这是一九四三年根据联共中央指示成立的一种技工学校。孤儿毕业时，除获得专门技术可作技术工人外，还同时完成七年制学校的教育。
    此外还有一种学习期限是七年的学校，如铁路学校和矿务学校，学生毕业时已完成中等技术教育，已经不是一般的技术工人，而是中级技术干部了。
    上述劳动后备部所领导的四种学校，除孤儿技工学校外，主要课程是技术教育。技术课和实习约占全部教学时间的四分之三。技术课一般地只有三个科目，即：（一）专门工艺学，内容是专门技术，如钳工或淬火工；（二）材料学，内容是识别劳动所使用的各种材料的性能；（三）绘图。普通课有物理、数学、俄文、文学、苏联历史及体育等。普通课只占全部教学时间的四分之一，主要是为了提高学生的知识水平，使能掌握技术。
    例如某技工学校的教学计划是：（一）技术课：专门工艺二百九十二小时，绘图一百三十八小时，材料学六十小时。（二）生产实习，二千二百一十九小时。（三）普通课：数学二百○七小时，物理一百三十八小时，俄文一百九十小时，历史一百六十小时，体育一百六十小时。以上三者共三千五百六十四小时。
    这些学校都有自己的实习工厂。上课和实习大多隔日轮流进行。上课一般是每日六小时。实习则第一年每日六小时，第二年前半年每日七小时，第二年后半年每日在工厂的车间车床上实习八小时。逐渐增加实习时间，是为了培养学生的劳动习惯。
    这些学校的学习特点是：学生一方面学习，一方面生产国民经济所必需的各种成品，其教育计划是和生产这些成品直接联系即在生产这些成品中完成。所以这些学校不仅可以培养出大批熟练的技术工人，同时还可以修理和制造出大量的工具、零件和机器等。苏联劳动后备部所属学校，在劳动后备部成立以来的十年中，曾制造各种车床三千架；修理火车头一万一千辆，车厢十万辆，拖拉机和联合收割机一万架；卫国战争期间，并制造地雷六百万枚，军火零件二千六百万件；制造游击队用的印刷机，野战用的无线电台，海军用的潜望镜，海上飞行用的救生船及数量极多的国民经济所必需的各种用具。因此在战时曾有五个学校获得国家的勋章，有二十五个学生荣膺苏联英雄的称号。在战后这些学校对国民经济的恢复也起了相当重大的作用。
    这些学校的学生，像工矿企业的工人们一样，也开展社会主义竞赛运动，竞赛的内容是如何把学习组织得更好，爱护实习所用的工具和机器，争取在实习中生产优良成品，提前完成定货任务等。每季总结竞赛一次，优秀者有奖励。
    这些学校都和一定的工矿企业取得联系，或附设在工矿企业内。工矿企业在各方面帮助学校：如帮助配备有高度熟练技术的工人为领班，帮助物色技术课教师，帮助解决校舍问题，帮助充实实习工厂的设备，乃至帮助实习生产的定货。对于这一切帮助，学校都给予一定的代价，例如工厂供给实习用的车床，学校折价付款；领班及技术课教师的工资由学校支付。工矿企业的工程师、技师、斯达哈诺夫工作者经常到学校讲演、作报告或作技术表演。学校的校长、副校长、教师及工矿企业的工程师、技师和先进工作者，共同组织技术教育委员会，研究技术教育的教学内容和教学方法。莫斯科某工厂百分之八十的工人是该厂所附设某技工学校的毕业生，双方关系非常密切，简直是一个不可分离的统一体。学生在学习期间已习惯为工厂的工人，而工厂也把学校当作自己的一个组成部分。
    这些学校的校长通常是由党的组织和行政领导干部中选拔。副校长有二个或三个：一个负责教务（多半受过高等技术教育）；一个负责政治思想教育（多半是党校或马列学院的毕业生）；另外一个负责总务（总领班也多半受过高等教育）。学生每二十至二十五人编为一班。班有领班（领班必须精通技术，他往往是高度熟练的七级技术工人，或是中等技术学校的毕业生）。在技术较复杂的技工学校，每十二、三人即编为一班。领班固定于一定的班次，直到该班学生毕业为止。
    这些学校也特别注意学生的政治思想教育，使他们成为优秀的苏维埃公民，共产主义事业的自觉的建设者。所以每一百个学生中配备有一个辅导员。领班也负有对学生进行政治思想教育的责任。
    这些学校也很关心学生的健康，重视体育工作。各校都有各种群众性的体育组织，去年某技工学校曾得摔跤冠军；一九五一年某些技工学校的学生曾赴布拉格参加体育表演。
    这些学校都有党和共产主义青年团的组织；有俱乐部、图书馆、青年技术家研究室等等。学生多在课外从事各种活动，如舞蹈、唱歌、下棋、滑冰、演剧、参加当地各种技术代表会议及其晚会。学生中不只有青年技术家，还有青年文学家、青年绘图家。
        这些学校的教员绝大部分是专职。由工矿企业的工程师和技师兼任的教员只是少数。学校把领班和教员组织起来，学习业务，或请教育家、专家来校作报告。莫斯科某技工学校的百十个工作人员全部在高等学校、中等技术学校或马列学院的函授部或夜校学习。
    这些学校的技术课教材全国有统一的规定，普通课教材也和一般学校不同。
    这些学校在招收新生时采用广泛宣传动员的方法，如印发宣传画和告青年书，组织各种报告会、展览会及召开家长会议等，使学生在了解各学校的学习情况和学习条件后能自愿报名。学生的学习用费完全由国家负担。伙食和服装免费供给，学生领有国家发给的制服、工作服、鞋、袜、衬衣、日常生活用品和文具、教科书等；对外地来的学生还供给整洁舒适的宿舍。学生实习生产可得到约为成品价值三分之一的工资。
    这些学校要求学生在毕业前三个月就能完成所将担负的生产工作的定额。学生平时有年终考试；毕业时有国家考试。学生经国家考试后，一般定为四级或五级工人（如为三级则不及格），并领得证明书。
    毕业生由劳动后备部统一分配。学校虽附设在一定工矿企业内，学生也在该一定工矿企业实习，但学生毕业后不一定即派到该工矿企业去工作。不过劳动后备部在分配学生时一般都是首先照顾该工矿企业的需要，而后再作统一调整。上述莫斯科某工厂百分之八十的工人都是该厂所附设的技工学校的毕业生，就是一个显明的例子。
    劳动后备部具有一切条件进行培养技术工人的工作：有充足的经费；有适合实际需要的实习工厂及各种现代化的设备；有专门编辑各种教科书的组织；有自己的出版机关，出版百种以上的教科书；有自己的若干所中等技术学校（只接受劳动后备部所属学校的毕业生为学生），培养所属学校的领班人才；有自己的若干所专门学院（由高等教育部统一领导），培养技术课程的教师；有专门的体育学院，培养体育教师；有自己的科学研究所，负责研究日益发展的科学技术；有教学方法研究室，研究教学工作，每月制定上课和实习的计划供各地学校使用，计划中特别指出各校应该学习何种新的技术及采用何种新的工作方法。
    劳动后备部很关心毕业生的正确使用和正当发展，它设有国家视导室，专门负责和毕业生取得密切联系，视察各地工矿企业单位对分配给的毕业生的使用是否适当。
    为帮助学生学习技术和提高学校工作人员的技术水平，劳动后备部出版了两种杂志：一名“生产教育”，一名“知识即力量”。
    劳动后备部和各有关经济部门、工会保持密切的联系，并取得他们必要的帮助。
