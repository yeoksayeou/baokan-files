    Tianjin Railway Bureau Business Statistics Section
    Saves Over Sixty Million Yuan Monthly in Long-Distance Telephone Fees After the "Three-Anti" Campaign

    Comrade Editor: After the "Three-Anti" movement, the Business Statistics Section of the Statistics Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau has overcome the wasteful use of long-distance telephones, saving the country over sixty million yuan monthly. Last year, the section wasted long-distance calls 1,177 times, resulting in a loss of over 100.8 million yuan. The main reason for the waste was a lack of awareness of economy and a lack of concern for public property. For example, some trivial matters and matters that could be handled later were all made "Class A calls." The scheduled calling times and frequencies were also inappropriately set. The waste was particularly serious last September when the lines between Tianjin and Taiyuan were congested.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the class consciousness of the employees has greatly improved. They examined the root causes of past waste and formulated specific conservation measures: establishing a call record book and stipulating that long-distance calls cannot be made casually; resetting the scheduled calling times and frequencies with various branch bureaus. Now, the number of "scheduled calls" has been reduced from 25 times per day in the past to 9 times per day; the call time has been reduced from 645 minutes to 250 minutes, which can save over 63.6 million yuan in long-distance telephone charges every month.

    天津铁路管理局业务统计科
    “三反”运动后每月可节省长途电话费六千多万元
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局统计处业务统计科，经过“三反”运动，在使用长途电话上的浪费现象已经克服，每月可为国家节省开支六千余万元。该科去年一年共浪费长途电话一一七七次，损失了一亿零八百多万元。造成浪费的主要原因是大家缺乏节约观念，不重视公家财产。比如有一些小事和可以缓办的事，都挂了“甲种通话”。定时通话的时间和次数也规定的不适当。特别是去年九月间，天津和太原间线路拥挤，业务统计科的浪费更严重了。
    经过“三反”运动，职工们的阶级觉悟大大提高了。他们检查了过去浪费的根源，制订了具体的节约办法：建立通话纪录簿，规定不能随便叫长途电话；重新制订了和各分局定时通话的时间和次数。现在，“定时通话”次数已由过去的每日二十五次减到每日九次；通话时间由六百四十五分钟减到二百五十分钟，每月因此可以节省长途电话费用六千三百六十多万元。　郭中霞
