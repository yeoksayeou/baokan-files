Following the instructions on drought prevention and resistance issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government, women in Kong Village, Xingtai Third District, Hebei Province, actively participated in the village's well-digging efforts to combat drought. Women Wang Haiyu and Li Xiuqin personally started digging wells. In one day, she and her uncle dug a well more than ten feet deep. Li Xiuqin went down into the well four times in one day while digging. Military dependents Zhao Guizhen and Chu Baoshan helped farmer Zhao Fengshan dig a well. Woman Wu Guangrong mobilized others to dig three wells, and she also specifically helped families with insufficient manpower to dig wells.

The well-digging and drought-fighting actions of the women in Kong Village promoted the well-digging work of the entire village. The village originally planned to dig fifty wells, but now plans to dig eighty, of which forty-five have been completed.

    河北邢台孔村妇女积极打井防旱
    中央人民政府政务院发布了防旱抗旱的指示后，河北邢台三区孔村妇女就积极参加了村里的打井防旱工作。妇女王海玉、李秀琴亲自下手打井。在一天内和她的叔父打了一个一丈多深的井；李秀琴在打井时，一天曾下井四次。军属赵桂贞和楚宝善帮助农民赵凤山打了一眼井。妇女吴光荣动员别人打井三眼，自己还具体帮助人力不足的人家打井。
    孔村妇女的打井防旱行动，推动了全村打井工作。这个村原定打井五十眼，现在计划打八十眼，已完成四十五眼。　张永江
