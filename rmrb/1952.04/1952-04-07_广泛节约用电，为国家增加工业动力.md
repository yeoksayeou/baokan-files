    Widespread Electricity Conservation to Increase National Industrial Power
    Zhang Gaichu
    During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in factories and mines in the Northeast region, serious waste of electricity was discovered. Electricity prices in the Northeast region were relatively low, so electricity users did not pay attention to conservation. Generally, management cadres in state-owned enterprises believed that "the electrical workshop is an auxiliary workshop, and electricity costs account for only a small proportion of the total product cost, so it doesn't matter whether we use more or less," thus neglecting the management of the electrical workshop. No one cared about how much electricity was used or whether it was reasonable. In some enterprises, it was rare to see light bulbs under 30 watts; some even installed 100-watt bulbs in toilets and corridors. The phenomenon of not turning off lights when sleeping or going out, and public places or guard lights being left on all night, was even more common. Some machines that could have been fitted with a 5-horsepower motor were equipped with 7- or 8-horsepower motors, or even larger ones. In workshops, there was a lack of attention to machine management, often allowing machines to idle, which was an even greater waste. Among residents, the use of electric stoves and light bulbs over 100 watts was also very common.
    The losses caused by these wastes are significant. In addition to directly wasting electricity, the economic value generated by the same kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity differs because of improper usage. One kWh used in production can produce one kilogram of copper or eight kilograms of cement; when used for general consumption (heating, lighting, cooking, etc.), its value is much smaller. Saving electricity not only allows users to save on electricity bills and increase industrial power but also reduces the nation's investment in building new power plants, accelerating our country's industrialization process. Today, when our industrial construction is developing rapidly and power generation capacity has not increased correspondingly, saving and using electricity reasonably is of particular importance.
    How should we save electricity? In addition to comprehensively adjusting the power load, general electricity users should pay attention to the following aspects:
    1. Save on lighting electricity. Electricity for lighting, except for production lighting, is concentrated in the evening, overlapping with industrial electricity usage, which easily creates peak loads. Therefore, saving on lighting electricity has a much greater economic value for power generation equipment than saving on general electricity. Therefore, vigorous propaganda and mobilization should be carried out among residents to form a mass movement for saving lighting electricity. Many street residents' groups in large cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenyang have included saving electricity and opposing electricity theft in their patriotic pledges, with good results. This method should be promoted. In enterprises and organizations, education on saving electricity should be conducted for all personnel, and the management of lighting electricity should be strengthened. In seasons with longer daylight hours, working hours can be moved forward to make full use of sunlight.
    2. Reduce waste in power usage for machinery. This work can be combined with load adjustment, systematically inspecting all power equipment and making reasonable adjustments to electrical equipment for full utilization. In addition, electricity should also be saved by strengthening the planning of equipment utilization. For example, use cranes in a planned way, avoiding empty trips and one-way trips; encourage workers not to let machines idle, etc.
    3. Save on electricity for heating. Except for medical institutions and certain enterprises that must have electric heating equipment, families and kitchens should be persuaded not to use electric stoves.

    广泛节约用电，为国家增加工业动力
    张盖楚
    东北地区各厂矿在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，检查出在电力使用方面有着严重的浪费现象。东北地区电价比较低廉，因此用电单位在使用电力时都不注意节约。一般国营企业的管理干部认为“电气车间是辅助车间，电费在产品总成本中只占极小的比重，用多用少无足轻重”，因而放松了对电气车间的管理。用电多少，是否合理，都无人过问。在有些企业里，很少看见三十度以下的灯泡；有的甚至连厕所、走廊也装上一百度的灯泡。至于睡觉、出外不关灯，公共场所或警卫照明灯通夜不关的现象更是普遍。有些机器本来安装一台五匹马力的电动机就够了的，可是竟装置了七匹八匹马力甚至更大的电动机。在车间中不注意对机器的管理，常让机器空转，这种浪费更大。在居民中，使用电炉和一百度以上的灯泡的现象，也很普遍。
    这些浪费所造成的损失是很大的。除直接浪费电力外，因为使电力使用不当，同是一度电，所产生的经济价值也不同。一度电，用在生产上，可以生产一公斤铜或八公斤水泥；用在一般消费上（取暖、照明、作饭等），它的价值就小得多了。节省了电力，除用户可以节省电费、增加工业动力外，还可以减少国家建设新发电厂的投资，加速我们国家工业化的过程。在今天，我们的工业建设发展很快，发电能力还没有相应提高的时候，尽量地节省和合理地使用电力，更有特殊重要的意义。
    应该怎样节省用电呢？除了全面地调整电力负荷之外，一般电力用户应注意以下几个方面：
    一、节省照明用电。电灯用电，除生产照明外，都集中在晚间，和工业用电时间相重叠，容易造成高峰负荷。因此，节约电灯用电，对于发电设备来说，要比节约一般用电的经济价值大得多。所以在居民中应大力进行宣传鼓动，形成群众性的节约电灯用电运动。上海、北京、沈阳等大城市的许多街道居民小组，把节约电力反对窃电订到爱国公约中去，效果很好。这种办法应该推广。在企业和机关团体中，应该对全体人员进行节约用电的教育，并加强对照明用电的管理。在白昼较长的季节，可以把工作时间提前，尽量利用日光。
    二、减少动力用电的浪费。这项工作可以和调整负荷结合进行，有计划地把全部动力设备进行一次检查，把电器设备作合理的调整，充分地予以利用。此外，还应该从加强设备利用的计划性方面节约用电。例如有计划地使用吊车，避免跑空车和跑单程；动员工人不使机器空转等。
    三、节约电热的用电。除医疗机关和某些企业必须有电热设备外，应说服家庭、厨房不要使用电炉。
