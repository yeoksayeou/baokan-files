    Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Industry
    Formulates Interim Standards for Structural Design of Buildings
    Will Trigger Major Reforms in Capital Construction Projects
    After studying advanced Soviet technology and the actual situation in the Northeast, the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Industry has formulated interim standards for structural design of buildings. The implementation of these standards can save 25% of the investment in the civil and structural parts of the Northeast Ministry of Industry's 1952 projects, or more than 10% of the total investment in civil construction, without affecting the effectiveness of the buildings' use.
    Before the formulation of the interim standards for structural design of buildings, there was no advanced, unified standard for civil construction design in the Northeast. The waste caused by conservative and unreasonable designs in civil construction projects was very serious. This situation is evident when comparing some incomplete technical standards previously used in the Northeast with the technical standards stipulated by the Soviet Union. The "load" standard (load refers to the weight borne by floors, roofs, foundations, stairs, etc.) generally adopted in civil construction design in the Northeast was on average about 50% higher than the Soviet standard; the "allowable stress" standard for materials of the same specifications (stress is the resistance of the material, and allowable stress is the stress that can be adopted under the condition of ensuring safety) was on average about 20% lower than the Soviet standard. Higher load standards and lower stress standards both require more materials. The new standards correct this long-standing waste. For example, the new standard stipulates that the live load on floors (the weight of people and furniture on the floor) is reduced by an average of about 30% compared to the past, the allowable stress of wood and steel is increased by an average of about 20% compared to the past, and the allowable bearing capacity of the foundation is increased by nearly doubled compared to the past. In the past, there was no reasonable calculation method for brick and stone structures, and decisions were made based only on experience. For example, the brick walls of ordinary buildings with two or fewer stories were made with a 1:3 cement mortar for no reason, but according to the new standard, a 1:3 mineral mortar can be used instead. If the cement saved from previous wall construction is used to replace the entire floor slab of the built house with concrete, there would still be some left over.
    The new standards not only propose practical and feasible methods for saving wood and cement, saving a lot of funds for China's civil construction projects, but also improve China's technical theoretical level. The significance of these interim standards for structural design of buildings to capital construction projects is the same as that of new coal mining methods to the coal mining industry, and high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-blade cutting to the machinery industry. It will trigger major reforms in capital construction projects. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 东北人民政府工业部  制定建筑物结构设计暂行标准  将引起基本建设工程中的重大改革

    东北人民政府工业部
    制定建筑物结构设计暂行标准
    将引起基本建设工程中的重大改革
    东北人民政府工业部研究了苏联先进技术和东北实际情况后，制定了建筑物结构设计暂行标准。这一标准的贯彻执行，可以在不影响建筑物使用效能的条件下，使东北工业部一九五二年的土木建筑结构部分投资节省百分之二十五，或使全部土木建筑投资节省百分之十多。
    在建筑物结构设计暂行标准制定以前，东北的土木建筑设计并没有一个先进的、统一的标准。土木建筑工程因设计上的保守和不合理而造成的浪费现象是十分严重的。如以东北过去采用的一些不完全的技术标准和苏联国家规定的技术标准相比较，这种情况就十分明显。东北一般土木建筑设计所采用的“荷重”标准（荷重即载重，就是指楼板、屋顶、地基、楼梯等所承载的重量）平均高于苏联标准百分之五十左右；相同规格材料的“许可应力”标准（应力就是材料的抵抗力，许可应力是保证安全的条件下所可采用的应力）平均低于苏联标准百分之二十左右。荷重标准规定得高和应力标准规定得低，都要多用材料。新标准就纠正了多少年来一贯存在着的这种浪费现象。如新标准规定的楼面活荷重（楼面上人和家具的重量），比过去平均降低了百分之三十左右，木材、钢材的许可应力比过去平均提高百分之二十左右，地基许可耐压力比过去平均提高将近一倍。过去对于砖石结构，没有合理的计算方法，只凭经验决定，如普通二层以下房屋的砖墙，过去毫无理由地采用一比三水泥浆来做，但根据新标准，却可以用一比三矿砂浆来做。如果把以往砌墙的水泥节省下来，可以把所筑房屋的全部楼地板换成混凝土还用不完。
    新的标准不仅提出了节约木材、水泥的切实可行办法，为我国土木建筑工程节省大量资金，而且提高了我国的技术理论水平。这一建筑物结构设计暂行标准对于基本建设工程的意义，正如新采煤方法之对于煤矿工业，高速切削和多刀多刃切削之对于机械工业一样，它将引起基本建设工程中的重大改革。（新华社）
