Xinhua News Agency, Andong, April 24th: A reporter from this agency reports on the circumstances of our air defense forces shooting down a U.S. military aircraft in Changdianhekou, saying: At 9:16 AM on April 13th, a batch of four U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Changdianhekou in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, China. Two of the U.S. aircraft strafed our peaceful residents over Yongdian Village and Beifamozicun Village in Yongdian District of the county, killing a cow belonging to farmer Cheng Yike of Yongdian Village, and injuring three fingers on the right hand and one finger on the left hand of resident Hao Zhangshi of Beifamozicun Village. These two U.S. aircraft were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire from our air defense forces over Changdianhekou at around 9:18 AM; one of them was immediately hit, crashed, and burned, and the pilot was killed on impact.

In Xiaoxigou, ten kilometers northwest of Changdianhekou, the reporter personally saw the corpse of this U.S. Air Force pilot. In a leather bag next to him, three silk military aviation maps, totaling six sides, were found. These maps were centered on six locations in China: Shenyang, Jehol, Beijing, Lushun, and the Soviet Union's Vladivostok, and the east coast of Korea. The ring worn on the American pilot's hand was engraved with the words "George V. Windlin." His epaulets indicated his rank was Major in the U.S. Air Force.

On the southern slope of Huanghuagou (nine kilometers northwest of Changdianhekou), where the U.S. aircraft crashed, the reporter saw the shattered wreckage of the aircraft. It was an F-86 jet fighter, with white five-pointed star markings on both sides of the fuselage, along with the characters "FU63," and the words "USAIRFORCE0636" on the tail. On a wing found elsewhere, there were also the characters "JSAF." Six heavy machine guns were also found in the wreckage of the aircraft, along with 1,050 rounds of ammunition nearby.

    新华社记者在长甸河口地区
    调查我击落美机情形
    【新华社安东二十四日电】本社记者报道我防空部队在长甸河口击落美国军用飞机的情形说：四月十三日上午九时十六分，美国飞机一批四架侵入我国辽东省宽甸县长甸河口上空，其中两架美机曾在该县永甸区永甸村、北发磨子村上空向我和平居民扫射，当将永甸村农民程义科的一头牛打死，并将北发磨子村居民郝张氏的右手三个指头和左手一个指头打伤。这两架美国飞机在九时十八分左右在长甸河口上空遭到我防空部队的高射炮火的猛烈射击；其中一架当即被我击中坠地焚毁，机上驾驶员一名坠地身死。
    在长甸河口西北十公里的小西沟，记者亲眼看到这个美国空军驾驶员的尸体，在他身旁的一个皮囊里，发现有绢质军用航空地图三张，共六面。这些地图是以我国的沈阳、热河、北京、旅顺以及苏联的海参崴，朝鲜东海岸六处地方为中心绘成的。这个美国驾驶员手上所佩戴的戒指上刻着乔治·维·温德林字样。他的肩章说明他的官阶是美国空军少校。
    在美机坠落地点的黄花沟（长甸河口西北九公里）的南山坡上，记者看到了破碎的飞机残骸。这是一架F——86型喷气式战斗机，机身两侧都有白色五星标志，旁边并有FU63字样，机尾有USAIRFORCE0636的字样；在另一处找到的机翼上面还有JSAF的字样。在飞机的残骸上还发现了六挺重机枪，附近并有一千零五十发子弹。
