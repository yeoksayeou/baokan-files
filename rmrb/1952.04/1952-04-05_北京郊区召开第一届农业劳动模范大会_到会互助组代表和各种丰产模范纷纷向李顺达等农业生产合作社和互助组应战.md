The Beijing Municipal People's Government Suburban Work Committee convened the first Beijing Suburban Agricultural Labor Model Congress from April 1st to 4th. The congress was attended by 119 model mutual aid team representatives, high-yield models, and model village cadres selected from various districts and villages in the suburbs. The central content of the congress was to summarize the achievements and experiences of agricultural and sideline production in the Beijing suburbs in 1951, to establish banners for various productions in the suburbs, to convey and arrange the agricultural production tasks for 1952, and to initiate a patriotic production increase competition movement, striving to increase unit area yield and complete the agricultural and sideline production tasks for 1952.

The congress first summarized the achievements of agricultural and sideline production in 1951: income from agricultural production in 1951 increased by 15.3% (one and a half tenths) compared to 1950, exceeding Mayor Peng Zhen's call to strive for an increase of half to one tenth compared to 1950. Income from sideline production also more than doubled compared to 1950. According to statistics from the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th districts and 11 villages in the 10th district: from February to November 1951, income from various sideline productions totaled 73 billion yuan, equivalent to 72% of agricultural income.

At the meeting, representatives of various high-yield models discussed and studied various high-yield experiences. In particular, the experiences of Shen Duo, who produced 20,967 jin of Chinese cabbage per mu, Li Xiyuan, who harvested 19,416 jin of winter melon per mu, Ni Dianli, who produced more than 13,300 jin of tomatoes per mu, Wang Shunming, who harvested more than 27,300 cucumbers per mu, Wang Guimin, who harvested 562 jin of peanuts per mu, and Gao Shunqi, who harvested 425 jin of dryland cotton per mu, were praised by all the labor models. Everyone proposed to learn the production techniques of the high-yield models and increase the unit area yield of various crops. During the exchange of experiences, everyone realized that the main reasons for obtaining high yields were: rational and large-scale fertilization; selection of excellent varieties; the use of new-style plows for deep plowing; doing a good job in drought prevention and moisture preservation, and timely sowing; and paying constant attention to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. At the same time, everyone experienced from the production process that only by organizing can technology be better improved and yields increased. For example, in Huangtugang Village in the 12th District, thanks to the leadership of Yin Weichen in organizing everyone, concentrating capital and manpower, not only saving labor but also improving technology, the village harvested 249 shi of grain more than in 1950. In addition, during the exchange of production experiences, the technological conservatism of some peasants and certain labor models in "keeping secrets to themselves" and the "production has reached its peak" mentality were criticized. Everyone was determined to lead the peasant masses in carrying out a mutual learning movement to "improve technology and increase yields."

After the labor models exchanged experiences, they carefully selected model mutual aid teams and various high-yield models in the suburbs. The selected model mutual aid teams included the Yin Weichen, Huo Fengqi, and Liu Yukun mutual aid teams; the selected high-yield models included Shen Duo, the high-yield model for Chinese cabbage, Wang Shunming, the high-yield model for melon cultivation, Gao Shunqi, the high-yield model for cotton, Wang Guimin, the high-yield model for peanuts, and Li Molin, the high-yield model for greenhouse vegetable cultivation; the selected model village cadres included Kou Shunyi and Chuan Zongkun. Then, all the labor models and model mutual aid team representatives, based on the conditions of their own villages and teams, formulated specific production increase plans and responded to the challenge from national famous labor models Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, and other agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. For example, the Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Huo Fengqi and Liu Yukun mutual aid teams jointly guaranteed that the average yield per mu of both paddy and dry land would increase by 20% compared to last year and responded to the challenge from Li Shunda and other agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams; and launched a production increase competition to all farmers and mutual aid teams in the suburbs. Gao Shunqi and Di Guilin, high-yield models for cotton in the suburbs, challenged Qu Yaoli with an average yield of 480 jin of seed cotton per mu on 25 mu of cotton (of which 5 mu averaged 600 jin). Shen Duo, Wang Shunming, and other five high-yield models for vegetable cultivation jointly launched a high-yield vegetable production increase competition. The conditions for their competition were: 22,000 jin of large Qingkou Chinese cabbage per mu; 20,000 jin of large trellis tomatoes per mu; 18,000 jin of small trellis tomatoes per mu; 29,000 cucumbers per mu; and also to ensure that the yield and quality of other vegetables planted were higher than the local general yield and quality.

On the last day of the meeting, Zhou Fengming, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Suburban Work Committee, based on the characteristics of the increasingly prosperous economy and growing population of large cities, the inevitable increase in the planting of industrial raw materials and non-staple food crops in the suburbs, as well as the production experience of 1951 and the production tasks of 1952, put forward three major tasks to all cadres, all farmers, all labor models, and mutual aid team representatives in the suburbs: First, to lead farmers to organize for mutual aid and cooperation and do a good job in mutual aid teams combining agriculture and sideline occupations. Second, in order to ensure a general increase in unit area yield of half to one tenth this year, it is necessary to do a good job in water conservancy, drought prevention, and pest control. Third, to deeply develop a mass patriotic production increase movement. Each district and village must carry out a patriotic production increase competition movement at the village, team, and household levels through labor model meetings, cadre meetings, and district and village representative meetings, striving to generally increase the unit area yield.

    北京郊区召开第一届农业劳动模范大会
    到会互助组代表和各种丰产模范纷纷向李顺达等农业生产合作社和互助组应战
    北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会从四月一日到四日召开了北京市郊区第一届农业劳动模范大会。出席大会的有郊区各区村选出的一百一十九位模范互助组代表、丰产模范和模范村干部。大会的中心内容是总结一九五一年北京市郊区农业副业生产成绩和经验，树立郊区各种生产的旗帜，传达和布置一九五二年的农业生产任务，并发起爱国增产竞赛运动，为提高单位面积产量、完成一九五二年农业副业生产任务而奋斗。
    大会首先总结了一九五一年的农业副业生产成绩：在农业生产方面的收入，一九五一年较一九五零年增加了百分之十五点三（一成五），超过了彭真市长号召争取比一九五零年增产半成到一成的要求。在副业生产方面的收入，也比一九五零年增加了一倍多。根据第十三、十四、十五、十六四个区及第十区十一个村统计：从一九五一年二月到十一月，各种副业收入共合七百三十亿元，相当于农业收入的百分之七十二。
    会上各种丰产模范代表讨论和研究了各种丰产经验。特别是每亩产白菜两万零九百六十七斤的申多，每亩摘一万九千四百一十六斤冬瓜的李喜元，每亩产西红柿一万三千三百多斤的倪殿利，每亩摘黄瓜两万七千三百多条的王顺明，每亩收花生五百六十二斤的王桂敏，每亩旱地棉花收四百二十五斤的高顺起等人的经验，更为全体劳动模范所称赞。大家提出：要学习各位丰产模范的生产技术，提高各种作物的单位面积产量。在交流经验时，大家又认识到，获得高额产量的主要原因是：合理而大量地施肥；选用优良品种；使用新式犁深耕；作好防旱保墒，及时播种；经常注意防治病虫害工作。同时，大家又从生产过程中体验到，只有组织起来，才能更好地改进技术，提高产量。如十二区黄土岗村，由于殷维臣领导大家组织起来，资本集中，人力集中，不仅节省了劳动力，还改进了技术，使全村比一九五零年多收了二百四十九石粮食。另外，在交流生产经验中，又批判了一些农民和某些劳动模范的“秘不传人”的技术保守思想和“生产到顶”思想，大家决心要带领农民群众开展“改进技术、提高产量”的互相学习运动。
    全体劳动模范交流经验后，又慎重地选出了郊区的模范互助组和各种丰产模范。选出的模范互助组有殷维臣、霍凤岐、刘玉昆等互助组；选出的各种丰产模范有白菜丰产模范申多，种瓜丰产模范王顺明，棉花丰产模范高顺起，花生丰产模范王桂敏，暖室种菜丰产模范李墨林等；选出的模范村干部有寇顺义、传宗昆等。接着，全体劳动模范和模范互助组代表就根据自己村和组的情况、条件，订出具体增产计划，向全国著名劳动模范李顺达、曲耀离等农业生产合作社和互助组应战。如殷维臣农业生产合作社和霍凤岐、刘玉昆互助组保证全组水、旱地每亩平均比去年增产二成联名向李顺达等农业生产合作社和互助组应战；并向全郊区的农民和互助组展开增产竞赛。郊区棉花丰产模范高顺起、狄桂林以种二十五亩棉平均每亩产四百八十斤籽棉（其中有五亩平均产六百斤）向曲耀离应战。种菜丰产模范申多、王顺明等五人联名发起蔬菜高额产量增产竞赛。他们竞赛的条件是：种大青口白菜每亩产二万二千斤；大架西红柿每亩产二万斤；小架西红柿每亩产一万八千斤；黄瓜每亩摘二万九千条；还要保证所种其他菜蔬的产量和质量都高于当地一般的产量和品质。
    会议最后一天，北京市郊区工作委员会副主任周凤鸣根据大城市经济日趋繁荣、人口日渐增多、郊区工业原料和副食作物的种植也必然要增多的特点，及一九五一年的生产经验和一九五二年的生产任务，向郊区的全体干部、全体农民、全体劳动模范和互助组代表提出三大任务：第一，要领导农民组织起来变工互助，搞好农、副业结合的互助组。第二，为保证今年普遍提高单位面积产量半成到一成，必须作好兴修水利、防旱、防虫等工作。第三，深入开展群众性的爱国增产运动。各区、村要通过劳动模范会、干部会、区村代表会，展开村、组、户的爱国增产竞赛运动，为普遍地提高单位面积产量而奋斗。
