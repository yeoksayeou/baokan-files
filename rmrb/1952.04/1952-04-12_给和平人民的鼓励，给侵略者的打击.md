    Encouragement to Peace-Loving People, Blows to Aggressors
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Marshal Stalin's answers to the four questions posed by the American newspaper editors on March 31st gave tremendous inspiration and encouragement to peace-loving people around the world, provided a compass for those who have lost their way in the current international situation, gave a sedative to those who are frightened by the warmongers, and dealt a heavy blow to the warmongers and imperialist aggressors.

    When World War II had just ended, the warmongers, the imperialist aggressors, especially the American imperialists, clamored for a third world war and prepared for a third world war. However, the unparalleled strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the firm will of peace-loving people around the world shattered the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, making it impossible for them to dare to provoke a third world war. But the imperialist aggressors are not reconciled; they are attacking at every opportunity, attempting to attack everywhere, or making threatening attacks. But they have all been beaten back by the giant hands of the people! The agents of the arms dealers, the warmongers, often take advantage of any opportunity to clamor about the arrival of a third world war. But the conspiracies of the war instigators have been shattered! Wherever the war instigators and imperialist aggressors make bigger adventures, they suffer the biggest blows. Korea is an example. This proves that any war adventure and aggression attempt by the imperialist aggressors can be crushed.

    When the imperialist aggressors' preparations for war became more frantic, and the American troops invading Korea became more brutal, to the point of launching bacteriological warfare, people who had been frightened by the warmongers' clamor worried: "Is the Third World War closer now than it was two or three years ago?" Stalin told the world in a "deafening" voice: "No, that is not the case!" If all the people of the world, especially the people in imperialist and capitalist countries, are awakened and not frightened, deceived, or exploited by the aggressors and war instigators, a third world war, as Marshal Stalin previously indicated, can be avoided. Therefore, Stalin's answer is an encouragement to peace-loving people, a pointer for those who lack clear understanding, and the most powerful blow to the aggressors.

    For the Chinese people standing on the front line against imperialist aggression, Stalin's answers to the four questions on the current international situation are a great encouragement! Our heroic People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army will continue to deal heavy blows to the American imperialist aggressors until they truly agree to peace.

    The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union will surely win. We have the determination and confidence to repel the aggression of American imperialism; we also have the determination and confidence to defend lasting world peace.

    给和平人民的鼓励，给侵略者的打击
    中国科学院副院长  李四光
    三月三十一日斯大林大元帅对于美国报纸编辑提出的四个问题的答复，给了全世界和平人民莫大的振奋和鼓舞，给了在目前国际形势下迷失方向的人们一个指针，给了被战争贩子吓住的人们一片镇静剂，给了战争贩子和帝国主义侵略者一个沉重的打击。
    第二次世界大战刚结束的时候，战争贩子们，帝国主义侵略者，特别是美帝国主义者，就叫嚣第三次大战，准备第三次大战了。但是，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的无比强大与全世界和平人民的坚强意志，粉碎了帝国主义侵略者的战争阴谋，使它不敢，也不能挑起第三次大战。但帝国主义侵略者是不甘心的，它处处乘隙进攻，处处企图进攻，或者作进攻的恫吓。但都被人民的巨掌打退了！军火商的代理人，战争贩子们，经常借任何一个机会，叫嚣第三次大战的来临。但战争挑拨者的阴谋都被粉碎了！战争挑拨者和帝国主义侵略者在哪里做更大的冒险，也就在哪里受的打击最大。朝鲜就是一个榜样。这就证明帝国主义侵略者的任何战争冒险和侵略企图都是可以被粉碎的。
    当帝国主义侵略者的备战更形疯狂、侵朝美军更形凶残，以致发动了细菌战的时候，被战争贩子的叫嚣吓住的人们担心：“第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？”斯大林以“震聋发聩”的声音告诉全世界：“不，不是这样”！全世界的人民，特别是帝国主义、资本主义国家内的人民，如果都觉悟过来，不为侵略者、战争挑拨者所吓倒，所欺骗，所利用，第三次大战，正如斯大林大元帅以前所指示的，是可以避免的。所以斯大林的这一句答复，对和平人民是鼓励，对认识不清的人们是指针，对侵略者是最有力的打击。
    对于站在反帝国主义侵略前线的中国人民，斯大林对目前国际形势四个问题的答复，是一个极大的鼓励！我们英勇的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，将继续给美帝国主义侵略者以沉重打击，一直到他们真正同意和平的时候。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营一定要胜利的。我们对打退美帝国主义的侵略有决心，有信心；对于保卫世界的持久和平也有决心，有信心。
