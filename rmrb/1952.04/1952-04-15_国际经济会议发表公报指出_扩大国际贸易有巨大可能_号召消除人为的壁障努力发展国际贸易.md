(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th) According to TASS, Moscow: The International Economic Conference, at its closing session on the 12th, adopted a communique on the general achievements of the economic conference, stating: The International Economic Conference was held in Moscow from April 3rd to 12th, 1952, attended by 471 delegates from 49 countries.

The conference studied the current state of all aspects of world trade and determined that the deterioration of international relations, particularly the increasing deterioration in recent years, has increased the artificial barriers hindering international trade. Traditional trade relations between countries have been severed, the geographical scope of trade has been restricted, and trade between East and West has been greatly reduced.

The disintegration of world trade is seriously undermining the economic development of many countries, unbalancing trade and payments, and adversely affecting living standards due to increasing food shortages, rising prices, increased unemployment, hindered social progress, and especially reduced housing construction.

After a broad and free exchange of views, the conference unanimously agreed that the volume of world trade can be greatly increased, and that expanding trade relations between countries can greatly benefit enterprises, industrialists, and agricultural operators, make fuller use of the economic resources of all countries, increase employment, and raise the living standards of the people.

The statements made by the representatives of various countries at the conference showed that differences in economic and social systems are not sufficient to prevent countries from expanding economic relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The conference showed that there is great potential for expanding trade between Western European countries, Britain, Canada, Latin American countries, Asian and African countries, the Soviet Union, China, Eastern and Central European countries.

The work of the conference showed that promoting the economic development of backward countries, supplying these countries with machinery and factory equipment, and establishing mutually beneficial relations in the prices of their exported raw materials and imported products are extremely important for developing international trade and peaceful economic cooperation.

The conference believes that the rapid industrialization of backward countries, and international cooperation for this purpose, are urgently needed and should be actively promoted.

The participants from various countries pointed out ways to increase the volume of foreign trade and listed the goods they could sell or buy on mutually beneficial terms. The participants also put forward many specific suggestions to promote international trade, especially to facilitate transactions between countries in their own currencies.

The conference provided an opportunity for business people from various countries to personally contact each other, discuss in detail all issues they were interested in, and conduct business negotiations. As a result of these negotiations, many transaction contracts have been concluded by commercial firms and enterprises from countries that sent representatives to the conference. The business negotiations that began during the conference are still ongoing. Business people from all countries are eager to take advantage of all opportunities to expand foreign trade.

In this situation, governments and the United Nations should take appropriate measures. Therefore, the conference decided to recommend that the United Nations General Assembly convene a world trade conference of governments in the near future, and invite representatives of business, trade unions, and other social organizations from various countries to participate.

It can be seen from this conference that the representatives of various countries who attended the meeting unanimously hope to continue and expand their efforts that have already begun in the field of international trade.

The conference specifically believes that it is appropriate to hold another international economic conference based on the principles followed by this Moscow International Economic Conference, that is, the principle of economic cooperation between all countries in the world regardless of their economic and social systems. At the same time, the conference decided to continue to exchange information on the import and export possibilities of many countries.

To complete these recommendations, the conference elected a committee to promote international trade.

The conference calls on entrepreneurs, economists, technical experts, trade unions, and cooperatives from all over the world, regardless of their political views, to support the conference's efforts to develop international commerce and eliminate obstacles to such commerce.

The conference believes that developing world trade on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and giving due attention to the needs of industrializing backward countries, will help strengthen international economic cooperation and help improve the living conditions of the people of all countries.

    国际经济会议发表公报指出
    扩大国际贸易有巨大可能
    号召消除人为的壁障努力发展国际贸易
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际经济会议在十二日举行的闭幕会议上通过一项经济会议一般成就的公报说：国际经济会议于一九五二年四月三日至十二日在莫斯科开会，到会的有四十九个国家的四百七十一位代表。
    会议研究了世界贸易各个方面的现状，并且确定：国际关系恶化的情况，特别是过去数年内日益加剧的恶化情况，使阻碍国际贸易的人为壁障增加了。国与国之间的传统贸易关系已被割断，进行通商的地理范围受到限制，东西两方之间的贸易大为减少。
    世界贸易之解体正在严重地破坏许多国家的经济发展，使贸易和支付失去平衡，而且因为粮食供应日益不足、物价上涨、失业人数增加、社会进步受阻，特别是因为房屋建筑减少，生活水准受到了恶劣的影响。
    会议在广泛而自由地交换意见之后，一致认为：世界贸易量可以大大增加；而各国之间扩大贸易关系，可以使企业界、工商业者和农业经营者得到很多利益，可以使一切国家的经济资源得到更充分的利用，可以增加就业，提高人民的生活水准。
    各国代表在会上的发言表明：经济制度和社会制度的不同，并不足以妨碍各国在平等互利的基础上扩大经济关系。
    会议表明：西欧各国、英国、加拿大、拉丁美洲各国、亚洲和非洲各国、苏联、中国、东欧和中欧各国彼此之间，有着扩大贸易的巨大可能。
    会议的工作表明：促进落后国家的经济发展，供给这些国家以机器和工厂设备，在它们输出的原料和输入的产品的价格上建立互利的关系，这几点对于发展国际贸易及和平经济合作是极其重要的。
    会议认为：迅速使落后国家工业化，并为此目的而进行国际合作，都是目前所迫切需要的，并应该努力促其实现。
    到会的各国人士指出了增加对外贸易量的方法，并列举了他们能够在互利条件上卖出或买进的货物。到会者并提出了许多具体的建议，来促进国际贸易，特别是便于各国以本国货币进行交易。
    会议使来自各国的企业界人士有机会亲自互相接触，详尽讨论他们所感到兴趣的一切问题，并进行商务谈判。由于这些谈判，派有代表出席会议的各国商行和企业，已订立了许多交易合同。在会议过程中开始的商务谈判，现在仍在继续进行中。各国的企业界人士都热切希望利用一切机会扩大对外贸易。
    在这种情况下，各国政府和联合国是应该采取适当措施的。因此，会议决定建议联合国大会在最近期间内召集各国政府举行世界贸易会议，并邀请各国工商界、工会及其他社会团体的代表参加。
    从这次会议可以看出：到会的各国代表都一致希望继续并扩大他们在国际贸易方面已经开始的努力。
    会议特别认为：根据这次莫斯科国际经济会议所遵循的原则，即世界各国不论其经济与社会制度如何来进行经济合作的原则，再举行一次国际经济会议，是适当的。同时，会议决定继续交换关于许多国家进出口可能的资料。
    为了完成这些建议，会议选出了一个委员会来促进国际贸易。
    会议号召世界各国的企业家、经济学家、技术专家、工会及合作社，不论他们的政治见解如何，都来支持会议为发展国际通商及消除这种通商方面的障碍所作的努力。
    会议相信：以平等互惠原则来发展世界贸易，并对落后国家工业化方面的需要给予应有的注意，将有助于加强国际间的经济合作，有助于改善各国人民的生活情况。
