    Suggest Promoting "Reading Newspapers in the Fields"
    The Shanxi Peasant Daily put forward the slogan "Reading Newspapers in the Fields" on the first page of its March 30th edition. This is very timely in the current busy spring plowing season. The newspaper listed many examples of how reading newspapers during breaks encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. For example, the reading group in Chixiang Village, Sixth District, Gaoping County, brought newspapers to the fields and places where wells were being repaired and canals were being dug during the drought prevention and resistance movement, reading them to everyone during breaks; or they used nighttime rest time to read newspapers at home, and then went to the fields during the day to discuss them. Because the newspaper explained the important significance of drought prevention and resistance, they were particularly enthusiastic in their work. Another example is the reading group in Wangjiazhuang, Fifth District, Licheng County, which, under the leadership of Fan Gouqun, Kong Dongyan, and other reading members, established field reading groups in seven mutual aid teams, becoming a good example of combining reading newspapers with production. In the drought prevention and resistance movement in the Fourth District of Pingshun County, the entire district of twenty villages originally subscribed to 86 copies of the Peasant Daily, which has now increased to 186 copies. All sixteen mutual aid teams in Beidanche Village in the district have subscribed to the Peasant Daily and elected reading group leaders and reading members to be responsible for leading field reading. The Nanan Lane mutual aid team in Tonghua Village, Fourth District of Hejin County, voluntarily requested reading members to come and read newspapers to them during their breaks. These methods are all worth emulating by reading groups in various places.
    In order to exchange information and experiences about the national patriotic production increase competition that is about to be launched, peasants' demands for reading newspapers are even more urgent. We hope that local Party committees will promptly lead rural reading groups to carry out the "Reading Newspapers in the Fields" movement that combines production and reading.　Hong Chun

    建议推广“地头读报”
    山西农民报在三月三十日的一版上提出了“地头读报”的口号。这在目前春耕农忙的季节里，是十分切合时宜的。该报列举了许多利用休息时间读报而鼓舞了群众的生产情绪的事例。如高平县六区赤祥村读报组，在防旱抗旱运动中，把报纸带到田间和修井打渠的地方，趁休息时间给大家读；或者是利用夜晚休息时间，在家里读报，白天则到地里去讨论。由于报纸上说明了防旱抗旱的重要意义，所以他们在工作时特别起劲。又如黎城五区王家庄的读报组，在范苟群、孔冬彦等七个读报员的带头下，分别在七个互助组里建立了田间读报组，成为读报结合生产的好榜样。平顺四区在防旱抗旱运动中，全区二十个村，原订农民报八十六份，现在增加到一百八十六份。该区北耽车村的十六个互助组，都订有农民报，选出了读报组长和读报员，负责领导田间读报。河津四区通化村南巷互助组，自动地要求读报员在他们休息时来读报。这些办法都值得各地读报组仿效。
    为了交流全国即将开展的爱国增产竞赛的情况和经验，农民的读报要求更迫切了。我们希望各地党委及时地领导农村读报组，开展生产和读报相结合的地头读报运动。　鸿春
