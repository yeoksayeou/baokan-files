    "Outline of Forestry" Author Accepts Readers' Criticism
    Editor: I have read Mr. Qi Changshun's letter published in the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" section on March 5th, as well as the letters forwarded to me from Mr. Xing Zhonglun, Zhang Tiancheng, Chen Li, and ten other gentlemen. I completely accept their criticisms of "Outline of Forestry." Currently, I have requested the Commercial Press to stop distributing the remaining copies, and I have begun a thorough revision of the book. The first edition of "Outline of Forestry" was published in 1946. The main reason why the book contains serious bourgeois ideology and serves as pro bono propaganda for imperialism is that I received higher education in German and Japanese imperialist countries and was deeply poisoned ideologically. In 1950, the Commercial Press planned to republish the book and asked me to write a preface for the second edition. At that time, although I immediately agreed, I did not carefully review the original book. All I thought about was "gaining both fame and fortune," and I did not consider at all that the erroneous ideas in the book would have an extremely negative impact on the vast number of readers. I am very grateful to the critics for their suggestions to me. This needle pricked my sore spot precisely. Like a thunderclap, I woke up from my dream. From now on, I am determined to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought conscientiously and serve the people wholeheartedly.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    “林学概论”作者接受读者批评
    编辑同志：我对三月五日人民日报“读者来信专页”所载戚长顺先生的来信以及你们转来的邢仲伦、张天成、陈黎等十位先生的来信，都已读过了。他们对“林学概论”的批评，我完全接受。现在，我除已请商务印书馆将存书停止发行外，并已着手对该书作彻底的修改。 “林学概论”初版于一九四六年。该书之所以含有严重的资产阶级思想，为帝国主义作了义务宣传，主要的原因是我受过德日帝国主义国家的高等教育，在思想上中毒过深。一九五零年商务印书馆拟将该书再版，要我写一再版序言。当时，我虽即表示同意，但对原书并未好好过目。我所想到的只是“名利双收”，而丝毫没有考虑到书中的错误思想，会给广大读者以极其恶劣的影响。我很感激批评者对我提出的意见。这一针正好扎到我的病根。霹雳一声，如梦初醒。今后我决心认真学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，全心全意为人民服务。郝景盛
