    Protesting the Austrian Reactionary Government's Persecution of Professor Brandweiner
    -- Summary of Readers' Letters
    Our newspaper continues to receive many letters from readers expressing immense anger at the Austrian government's unreasonable act of illegally dismissing Professor Brandweiner, a peace fighter, from his university position, in accordance with the will of American imperialism.
    They unanimously point out that it was precisely because Brandweiner truthfully exposed to the people of the world the crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and our country, which aroused the panic and fear of American imperialism, that he was subjected to shameless persecution. The correspondence group of the Engineering College of Peking University wrote in their letter: "This proves that the American aggressors are afraid of exposing their monstrous crimes, and it also proves that the reactionary Austrian government is an accomplice of American imperialism." Reader Li Dexing said: "The persecution of the peace fighter Brandweiner by American imperialism and its lackeys shows how keen they are on germ warfare, and at the same time, it shows how terrified they are in their hearts."
    However, this barbaric act by American imperialism and the Austrian government can only further expose their monstrous crimes. Reader Duan Mingchun wrote in his letter: "The shameless persecution of peace fighters can only once again make people clearly recognize the evil face of American imperialism. I believe that after being dismissed from his post, Brandweiner, like all the excellent peace fighters who have been persecuted, will fight more tenaciously and resolutely."
    The readers unanimously support the Austrian people's protest struggle and express their cordial greetings to the outstanding peace fighter Brandweiner.

    抗议奥地利反动政府迫害布兰德魏纳教授
    ——读者来信综述
    本报继续接到许多读者来信，对于奥地利政府按照美帝国主义的意旨，非法解除和平战士布兰德魏纳大学教授职位的无理行为，表示无比的愤怒。
    他们一致指出，正是由于布兰德魏纳把美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国撒布细菌的罪行，据实向全世界人民揭发出来，引起了美国帝国主义的恐慌和畏惧，才对布兰德魏纳进行无耻的迫害。北大工学院通讯组来信说：“这证明了美国侵略者害怕暴露他们的滔天罪行，同时也证明了反动的奥地利政府是美帝国主义的帮凶。”读者李德星说：“美帝国主义及其走狗，迫害和平战士布兰德魏纳，说明了他们是如何地热衷于细菌战，同时也说明他们内心是多么恐惧。”
    但是，美帝国主义和奥地利政府这一野蛮行为，只能更加暴露他们的滔天罪行。读者段铭春来信说：“对和平战士的无耻迫害只能再一次使人们清楚地认识美帝国主义的罪恶面目。我相信，布兰德魏纳被免职以后，将像一切被迫害过的优秀的和平战士们一样，更顽强、更坚决地战斗下去。”
    读者一致声援奥地利人民的抗议斗争，向杰出的和平战士布兰德魏纳表示亲切的慰问。
