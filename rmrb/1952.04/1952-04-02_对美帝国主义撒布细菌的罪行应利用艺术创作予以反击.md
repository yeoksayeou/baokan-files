    The Crime of Spreading Bacteria by US Imperialism Should Be Counterattacked Through Artistic Creation
    The comrades of the Central Academy of Fine Arts have done a lot of work in the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. During the Spring Festival, they used forms easily accepted by the masses, such as "carrying-pole plays" and "crank-operated peep shows," to conduct propaganda to citizens in groups at the Labor People's Cultural Palace, exposing various facts about the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. In order to cooperate with the "Five-Anti" struggle of shop employees and workers, they performed several times at the general meeting of shop employees and workers in the Second District, which played a considerable educational role. They have also created a lot of comic strips and propaganda posters, which have been published in newspapers and periodicals such as the "People's Daily," "China Youth Daily," and "Guangming Daily." In addition, they also supply window display materials for Xinhua Bookstore and other organizations.
    In order to fully expose the heinous crime of spreading bacteria by US imperialism, I hope that art workers will use artistic creation in many ways for propaganda, and publicize common sense of epidemic prevention to the masses. This is very necessary.

    对美帝国主义撒布细菌的罪行应利用艺术创作予以反击
    中央美术学院的同志们在伟大的“三反”和“五反”斗争中，作了不少工作。春节中，他们在劳动人民文化宫，利用“扁担戏”、“拉洋片”等易为群众接受的形式，分组向市民宣传，揭发了资产阶级猖狂进攻的各种事实。为了配合店员工人的“五反”斗争，他们又在二区店员工人大会上，演出几次，起了相当的教育作用。他们还创作了不少的连环画及宣传画，分别刊载在“人民日报”“中国青年报”“光明日报”等报刊上。另外像新华书店等的橱窗宣传材料，也由他们供给。
    为了充分地揭露美帝国主义撒布细菌的滔天罪行，我希望艺术工作者多方利用艺术创作进行宣传，并向群众宣传防疫常识，这是很需要的。     魏方艾
