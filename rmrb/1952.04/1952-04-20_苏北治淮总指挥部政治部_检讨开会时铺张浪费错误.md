    Political Department of the Subei Huai River Harnessing Headquarters
    Self-criticism for Extravagance and Waste During Meetings

    Editor: The People's Daily published Comrade Xing Kui's letter on March 24th, criticizing the extravagance and waste of the Yancheng Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters during meetings. This issue is related to us, and we hereby make the following self-criticism:

    When the winter Huai River Harnessing project concluded last winter, the Yancheng Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters convened a meeting in Funing with over 700 cadres to summarize the winter project and arrange the work for this spring. At that time, some cadres requested to see a Beijing opera performance. The Subei Experimental Beijing Opera Troupe was planning to come to the Huai River construction site for a performance. Our department then telegraphed the troupe to come and perform at the Funing cadre meeting. We did not anticipate that it would cost a lot of money beforehand. Because the troupe had a large number of people, they chartered a special boat from Yangzhou. After arriving in Funing, we learned that the boat fare had cost 13 million yuan, and we were shocked, but there was no way to recover the money. Therefore, the main reason for this waste was our insufficient understanding of the central government's spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and our lack of a strong view of cherishing national wealth, which resulted in the waste of national wealth. We will be more vigilant in the future and thoroughly eliminate this wasteful phenomenon.

    Regarding the issue of inviting people to drink and stay in hotels, because there were very few public houses in Funing, we arranged for the troupe members to stay in hotels; during the final dinner of the conference, we invited six leading cadres of the troupe to participate in the dinner, and did not provide any separate reception.

### 苏北治淮总指挥部政治部  检讨开会时铺张浪费错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    苏北治淮总指挥部政治部
    检讨开会时铺张浪费错误
    编辑同志：人民日报三月二十四日登载了星魁同志的来信，批评盐城专区治淮指挥部开会时铺张浪费的情形。这一问题和我们有关，特作检查如下：
    去冬治淮工程结束时，盐城专区治淮指挥部在阜宁召开了七百多人参加的干部会议，总结冬季工程，并布置今春工作。当时部分干部向我们提出看一次京戏的要求。这时苏北实验京剧团拟来淮河工地作慰问性演出，我部即电请该团来阜宁干部会出演。事先我们并没有想到要花很多的钱。该团由于人数较多，从扬州雇了专轮前来。到达阜宁后，我们才知道已经用去船费一千三百万元，当时大吃一惊，但已无法挽回。所以造成这一浪费主要的原因是我们对中央增产节约的精神认识不足，珍惜国家财富的观点不强，因而浪费了国家的财富。我们今后当严加警惕，彻底肃清这种浪费现象。
    关于请喝酒、住旅馆问题，因阜宁公共房屋很少，所以请该团团员住了旅馆；大会最后会餐时，曾请该剧团负责干部六人参加会餐，并未别作招待。
