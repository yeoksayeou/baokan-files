Rice Production Model Chen Yongkang

\tThe Young Pioneers of Changlu Township, Songjiang County, heard that Chen Yongkang had received the Patriotic Bumper Harvest Certificate of Merit, Medal, and Bonus issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and they all came to congratulate Chen Yongkang.

\tWith the help of the People's Government, Chen Yongkang and six other farmers have formed a mutual aid team this year. The whole team has a total of 56.08 mu of cultivated land, and this year they plan to harvest an average of 1,000 jin of rice per mu, and strive to create a new record of 1,600 jin of rice per mu on three mu of land. This is a scene of Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team meeting to discuss the completion of this year's bumper harvest plan. (Photo by Zhu Ge)

\tChen Yongkang pays great attention to selecting excellent varieties. He not only looks for good seeds from various varieties, but also selects good ears from the good seeds, and continuously breeds and selects them using the "uniform ear" method. His "Laolaiqing" late japonica seeds were selected and bred using the "uniform ear" method after more than ten years of breeding. This is a scene of Chen Yongkang preparing to preserve the "Laolaiqing" improved varieties in bags. (Photo by Zhu Ge)

\tChen Yongkang's rice transplanting method is also creative. He adopted a small-plant square close planting method, with only one to three seedlings planted per plant. At the same time, the spacing between plants and rows is close to a square. The number of rice plants is more than others, and they grow particularly well. After farmer Gu Yougen learned Chen Yongkang's transplanting method, his rice production increased by 10%. This is a scene of Chen Yongkang and Gu Yougen studying farming methods in the field.

\t"Sparse sowing" is Chen Yongkang's outstanding creation in rice farming technology. Sparse sowing can make the seedlings fully develop and become strong and healthy seedlings. When transplanting to the paddy fields, there is no need to plant too many, only one to three seedlings are enough for each plant, so each mu of field only needs five jin of rice seeds, which can save half of the seeds, and the effect is better. This is a scene of Chen Yongkang scattering rice seeds in the nursery field. (Photo by Dong Weikun)

\tChen Yongkang's whole family, young and old, are threshing and sifting rice on the ground in front of the house. Looking at this pile of grain, they are truly unspeakably happy. (Photo by Dong Weikun)

\tIn order to prevent and control diseases and insect pests and strive for a bumper rice harvest, Chen Yongkang actively mobilized the women of the entire mutual aid team to dig up rice roots after completing the rice harvesting work, making use of the winter slack season. (Photo by Zhu Ge)

\tRice production model Chen Yongkang is from Changan Village, Changlu Township, Songjiang County, Sunan Administrative Region. He is 45 years old this year. After liberation, under the correct leadership and vigorous help of the People's Government, he has continuously researched and improved rice farming technology, creating a new record of 1,433 jin of rice per mu. This is a scene of Chen Yongkang receiving the 1951 Patriotic Bumper Harvest Certificate of Merit, Medal, and Bonus issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

    水稻丰产模范陈永康
    松江县长漊乡的少年儿童队队员们听说陈永康获得了中央人民政府农业部颁发的爱国丰产奖状、奖章和奖金后，都来向陈永康贺喜。陈永康和儿童们在一起拍照。　　　　　　　　　　（朱哥摄）
    在人民政府的帮助下，今年起陈永康和另外六户农民已经成立了互助组。全组共有耕地五十六亩零八厘，今年计划平均每亩要收获稻谷一千斤，其中有三亩要争取创造每亩丰产一千六百斤稻谷的新纪录。这是陈永康互助组开会讨论完成今年丰产计划的情形。

    陈永康非常注意选取优良品种。他不但从各种品种中去找寻好种，并且还从好种内再选取好穗，用“一穗齐”的办法来不断地进行繁殖选育。他的“老来青”晚稉种籽就是用“一穗齐”的办法，经过十多年的繁殖而选育起来的。这是陈永康把“老来青”良种袋袋准备保藏的情形。　　　　　　　（朱哥摄）
    陈永康的插秧方法也是有创造性的。他采取了小株方形密植法，每棵只插一根到三根秧苗。同时株、行距接近正方形。稻棵数目比人家多，生长得也特别好。农民顾友根学习了陈永康的插秧办法后，稻谷产量就增加了一成。这是陈永康和顾友根在田里研究耕作方法的情形。

    “落谷稀”是陈永康在水稻耕作技术上突出的创造。稀播可使秧苗充分发育，成为壮健的肥秧。移植本田时也不需要多插，每棵只要一根到三根秧苗就够了，这样每亩田只要五斤谷种，可以节省一半种籽，而效果却更好。这是陈永康在秧田里撒谷种的情形。　（董为焜摄）
    陈永康全家老少在屋前场地上牵砻筛谷。他们看着这一大堆的粮食，心里真有说不出的高兴。

    为了防治病虫害，争取水稻丰收，陈永康在完成水稻收割工作后，并利用冬闲时间，积极发动全互助助的妇女们拔掘稻根。

    水稻丰产模范陈永康是苏南行署区松江县长漊乡长岸村人，今年四十五岁。解放后他在人民政府正确的领导和大力的帮助下，不断地研究改进了水稻的耕作技术，创造了一亩田一千四百三十三斤的水稻丰产新纪录。这是陈永康领受中央人民政府农业部颁发的一九五一年爱国丰产奖状、奖章和奖金时的情形。　　　　　　（费适摄）

    华东农林部为了研究和总结陈永康的水稻丰产经验，曾派调查组到他家里去进行调查。这是陈永康向调查组的工作人员介绍水稻耕作技术时的情形。　　　（董为焜摄）
