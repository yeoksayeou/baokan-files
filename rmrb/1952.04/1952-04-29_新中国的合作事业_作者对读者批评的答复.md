A response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the People's Daily

    Authors of "The Cooperative Cause of New China" Respond to Readers' Criticism
    Editor: Xie Guangpin's letter criticizing the book "The Cooperative Cause of New China," published in the People's Daily's "Reader's Letters" section on April 16th, is completely correct, and we are willing to accept it with an open mind. We believe it is necessary to notify the Tangdi Publishing House to suspend the printing of this book, and we have already begun to thoroughly revise it. In the future, we will strengthen our political study to avoid making mistakes in writing again.
Zhang Yixian Zhang Puan

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    “新中国的合作事业”作者对读者批评的答复
    编辑同志：四月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载了谢光品同志批评“新中国的合作事业”一书的来信。这一批评是完全正确的，我们愿意虚心地接受。我们认为有必要通知棠棣出版社把这本书暂停刊印，并已开始对这本书作彻底的修正。今后我们当加强政治学习，以求在写作中不再发生错误。张亦先  章普安
