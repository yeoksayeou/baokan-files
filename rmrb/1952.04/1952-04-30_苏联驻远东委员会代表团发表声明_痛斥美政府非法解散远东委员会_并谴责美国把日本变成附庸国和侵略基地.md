Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 29th: TASS, New York, April 29th: The US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Hamilton (also the chairman of the Far Eastern Commission), sent a letter to Johnsson, the secretary-general of the Far Eastern Commission, on April 23rd regarding the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission due to the so-called Treaty of Peace with Japan taking effect on April 28th. In response, Pan Youxin, the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, delivered the following statement from the Soviet delegation to Hamilton, the chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, on April 28th:

"Regarding the letter from the US representative to the Far Eastern Commission concerning the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet delegation to the Far Eastern Commission deems it necessary to state the following:

The US representative's statement regarding the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission is yet another illegal action on the part of the US government. This action is illegal because it is being taken following the illegal separate Treaty of Peace with Japan, the signing of which violated all relevant international agreements regarding Japan – the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, the various decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and the United Nations Declaration issued on January 1, 1942.

The US government is flagrantly violating the aforementioned international agreements regarding Japan, and this is not the first time. Even before the separate Treaty of Peace with Japan was signed, it was already clear that the US's objectives in Japan had nothing in common with its responsibilities to prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor nation again.

During its occupation of Japan, the US occupying authorities not only failed to implement the resolution on the democratization of Japan, but also helped Japan establish a police-state regime to suppress democratic organizations and democratic leaders.

As early as 1948, the Soviet delegation opposed the order issued by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers to the Japanese government regarding the revision of the 'National Public Service Law.' At that time, the Soviet delegation pointed out that this measure by the occupying authorities infringed upon the rights of the Japanese working people and violated the Potsdam Proclamation and the political decisions of the Far Eastern Commission regarding the democratization of Japan.

Later, in successive statements on this issue, the Soviet delegation repeatedly demonstrated with concrete facts that the policy of the US occupying authorities aimed to encourage the Japanese government to intensify its suppression of the democratic rights of the Japanese people, to suppress the legitimate activities of trade unions and other labor organizations, and to establish a police-dominated regime in Japan.

Today, the consequences of this US policy are well known. Even American newspapers have to admit that, at present, basic human rights are being violated in Japan. Japanese workers, farmers, intellectuals, and students are subjected to the brutal persecution of the police. One only needs to recall the large-scale suppression carried out by the Japanese police against democratic organizations on February 21st and 22nd of this year, when they used weapons, tear gas, etc. against the Japanese people.

As everyone knows, the various international agreements regarding Japan paid particular attention to the task of eliminating Japanese militarism and preventing its revival, and this task was inseparably linked to the task of promoting the democratization of Japanese political life.

But the fact is that the US occupying authorities, in violation of these international agreements, adopted a policy of encouraging and supporting Japanese militarists and revanchist elements, rather than a policy of preventing the revival of Japanese militarism. The US authorities had long ago begun to illegally release Japanese war criminals sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, including major war criminals.

The occupying authorities encouraged the persecution of Japanese democratic organizations, and it did everything possible to assist in the restoration of militaristic organizations and extreme nationalist organizations. It openly supported Japanese political leaders who promoted revanchist ideas.

It is enough to recall just one thing. Ashida Hitoshi, the then Japanese Foreign Minister who openly made revanchist remarks in 1947, became the Prime Minister of Japan in 1948 with the support of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. This is not surprising, because today everyone knows that the US government, in order to realize its war plans in Japan, is relying on those military figures who have more than once forced Japan onto the path of aggression, rather than relying on the democratic forces of Japan.

The Soviet representatives to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan have repeatedly stated that this policy violates the international obligations undertaken by the US government and violates the agreement of the major powers on the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan.

The continued implementation of this policy by the US in its relations with Japan is manifested in the conclusion of the separate Treaty of Peace with Japan. The conclusion of this treaty demonstrates the extent to which the US government's policy of turning Japan into a military bridgehead of the US in the Far East has reached. This is why the separate Treaty of Peace with Japan and the so-called 'Security Treaty' can only be called treaties for preparing another war in the Far East. With the assistance of the 'Security Treaty,' Japan is being turned into a vassal state of the US, a country that must subordinate the interests of its citizens to the aggressive aims of the US ruling clique.

The statement regarding the termination of the Far Eastern Commission is the final step in the US government's policy of seriously violating its obligations to Japan. As everyone knows, the Far Eastern Commission has not yet completed the tasks assigned to it by the decisions made at the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 1945, which were signed by China. Nevertheless, the statement on the termination of the Far Eastern Commission was still issued. The fact that US troops remain stationed in Japan as a result of forcing Japan to conclude the separate treaty and the aforementioned 'Security Treaty' underscores Japan's vassal status. Therefore, Japan's position has not actually changed. Japan remains an occupied country, and all the adverse consequences for its national independence and national sovereignty remain. As everyone knows, the responsibility for creating this situation lies primarily with the US government. The Soviet government, which insists on the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Japan and insists on the conclusion of a genuine Treaty of Peace with Japan with the participation of all relevant countries, cannot bear any responsibility for the creation of this situation."

Pan Youxin requested that the Soviet delegation's statement be published as a document of the Far Eastern Commission.

### 苏联驻远东委员会代表团发表声明  痛斥美政府非法解散远东委员会  并谴责美国把日本变成附庸国和侵略基地

    苏联驻远东委员会代表团发表声明
    痛斥美政府非法解散远东委员会
    并谴责美国把日本变成附庸国和侵略基地
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：美国驻远东委员会代表哈米尔顿（也是远东委员会的主席），就所谓对日和约自四月二十八日起生效因而解散远东委员会一事，于四月二十三日致函远东委员会秘书长约翰逊。为此，苏联驻远东委员会代表潘友新特于四月二十八日将苏联代表团的下列声明送交远东委员会主席哈米尔顿：
    “对美国驻远东委员会代表关于解散远东委员会的信件，苏联驻远东委员会代表团认为有必要声明如下：
    美国代表关于解散远东委员会的声明，是美国政府方面的再一次的非法行动。这个行动之所以非法，是由于那是随着非法的单独对日和约而采取的，而这个非法的单独和约的签订，违反了一切有关的对日国际协定——开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、雅尔塔协定、远东委员会的各项决定以及一九四二年一月一日发表的联合国宣言。
    美国政府不惜悍然违反上述对日国际协定，这已不是第一次。远在单独对日和约签订以前，已经明显看出：美国在日本的目的，与它所承担的责任——防止日本再度成为侵略国——是毫无共同之处的。
    美国占领当局在占领日本期间，不但没有实现日本民主化的决议，而且还帮助日本建立一个警察统治的政权，来镇压民主团体和民主领袖。
    早在一九四八年，苏联代表团就曾经反对盟国驻日总司令向日本政府所发出的关于修改‘国家公务员法’的命令，当时苏联代表团指出：占领当局这种措施侵犯了日本劳动人民的权利，并违背波茨坦公告以及远东委员会关于日本民主化问题的政治决定。
    后来，苏联代表团在历次关于这个问题的声明中，曾一再以具体事实证明：美国占领当局的政策旨在鼓励日本政府加紧压制日本人民的民主权利，抑制工会和其他劳动人民团体的合法活动，并在日本建立一个警察专权的政权。
    今天，美国这种政策的后果已是尽人皆知的事了。即使美国报纸也不得不承认：目前，在日本，基本人权已遭到侵犯。日本工人、农民、知识分子和学生都受到警察的蛮横的迫害。这里只需回想一下今年二月二十一日到二十二日日本警察对民主团体所采取的大规模的镇压手段就够了，这一次，他们使用武器、催泪弹等来对付日本人民。
    大家知道，有关日本的各项国际协定特别注意肃清日本军国主义及防止日本军国主义复活的任务，这个任务是与促使日本政治生活民主化的任务不可分割地联系着的。
    但事实证明，美国占领当局违反这些国际协定而采取了鼓励和支持日本军国主义分子及复仇主义分子的政策，不是采取防止日本军国主义复活的政策。美国当局老早就开始非法地提前释放远东国际军事法庭所判刑的日本战争罪犯，包括主要战争罪犯在内。
    占领当局鼓励对日本民主团体进行迫害，它千方百计地协助恢复军国主义组织和极端国家主义组织。它公开支持宣传复仇思想的日本政治领袖。
    我们只追述一件事就够了。在一九四七年公开发表复仇言论的当时日本外相芦田均，于一九四八年在盟国总司令的支持下变成日本的首相。这是不足为奇的，因为今天人人都知道，美国政府为了在日本实现它的战争计划，正依赖那些曾不止一次地迫使日本走上侵略道路的军事人物，而不是依赖日本的民主力量。
    远东委员会和盟国对日委员会的苏联代表曾不止
    一次地声明，这种政策违背了美国政府所承担的国际义务，违反了各大国关于建立和平民主的日本的协议。
    美国在对日关系上继续实施这种政策的表现就是缔结单独对日和约。这个条约的缔结，说明了美国政府把日本变成美国在远东的军事桥头堡的政策已经是到了什么地步。这就是单独对日和约与所谓
    ‘安全条约’之所以只能称为在远东准备另一次战争的条约的原因。在‘安全条约’的协助下，日本正被变成美国的一个附庸国家、变成必须使其国民利益服从于美国统治集团的侵略目的的一个国家。
    关于结束远东委员会的声明，是美国政府严重违反其对日本的义务的政策的最后步骤。大家知道，远东委员会还远没有完成一九四五年苏、美、英三国外长的莫斯科会议作出的，有中国签字的那些决定所交给它的任务，尽管如此，结束远东委员会的声明还是发表了。强迫日本缔结单独和约与上述的‘安全条约’的结果，美国军队仍然留驻日本，这就着重说明了日本的附庸地位。所以，日本的地位实际上并未改变。日本仍然是一个被占领国家，随之而来的对于它的民族独立和国家主权的一切不良后果依然存在。大家知道，造成这种局势的责任主要在于美国政府。坚持一切占领军队撤离日本、坚持由一切有关国家参加缔结一个真正的对日和约的苏联政府，对于这种局势的造成是不能负任何责任的。”
    潘友新要求把苏联代表团的声明作为远东委员会的文件予以发表。
