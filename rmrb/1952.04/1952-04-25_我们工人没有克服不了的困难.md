We Workers Have No Difficulties We Cannot Overcome
Liu Jinliang, Model Worker of Fushun Power Plant

    This is the first time I have left my motherland to go to our fraternal country, the German Democratic Republic, to participate in the May Day International Labor Day celebrations. As the May Day International Labor Day is approaching, it is also the time when the great "Three-Anti" Movement has achieved great victories. When I recall the situation of our Fushun Power Plant workers trying to burn low-quality coal last year, I feel particularly excited. Because the "Three-Anti" struggle has created better conditions for us to increase production and practice economy, we can better start construction.
    When Chairman Gao Gang called on us last year to increase production and save 5 million tons of grain, the workers of our Fushun Power Plant discussed with each other: "How can we respond to this call?" At that time, I thought: If we can use low-quality coal instead of good coal, it can not only reduce the cost of power generation, but also use the saved good coal for other important industrial production. However, I didn't dare to put forward this idea immediately, because I knew that we had tried to burn low-quality coal twice before, and both failed. If we want to try to burn low-quality coal again, we must not fail again.
    To avoid failure, we must study the reasons for past failures.
    I talked to workers and technicians, soliciting their opinions on the previous trial burning of low-quality coal. I found that the main reason for our failure was ideological problems. The biggest problem was that the technicians and workers were not well integrated. Technicians didn't consult with workers, only relying on their books; workers didn't actively seek out technicians either, always feeling that technicians had no practical experience. In order to solve this ideological problem, we held several meetings with technicians, and mutually reviewed our ideological shortcomings. Everyone realized that technicians and workers must be closely integrated to improve production. At the meeting, the workers and technicians jointly studied how to solve the technical difficulties of trying to burn low-quality coal.
    Under such conditions, my confidence increased. I put forward a plan to try burning low-quality coal, which was supported by everyone. We specifically set up a low-quality coal test group, and the members of the group made a reasonable division of labor. Three technicians were responsible for recording steam temperature, wind pressure, etc., and I was responsible for the actual operation.
    When we started the experiment, we encountered many operational difficulties. However, our only magic weapon for dealing with difficulties is to consult with our fellow workers more. We also encountered many technical difficulties, which the technicians helped us solve. After five days of testing, we mixed in one-third of low-quality coal, and it did burn successfully. When we succeeded in mixing in half of low-quality coal, the technicians asked the workers, "Can we burn all low-quality coal?" The workers confidently replied, "Yes!" On September 25th last year, we tried burning all low-quality coal, and finally succeeded.
    Today, we are all happy to burn low-quality coal. Last year, just because we used low-quality coal instead of good coal, we saved the country more than 22,900 tons of good coal, reducing fuel costs by two-thirds.
    In the process of trying to burn low-quality coal, I deeply realized that we workers have no difficulties we cannot overcome.
    I believe that after I go abroad, I will continue to hear good news about the new production achievements created by workers across the country in the Red May.

### 我们工人没有克服不了的困难

    我们工人没有克服不了的困难
    抚顺发电厂劳动模范  刘金良
    我第一次离开祖国，到我们的兄弟国家——德意志民主共和国去，参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼。在“五一”国际劳动节快要到来的时候，正是伟大的“三反”运动获得巨大胜利的时候；我回忆去年我们抚顺发电厂工人试烧劣煤的情形，感到特别兴奋。因为“三反”斗争给我们创造了更好的增产节约的条件，我们能够更好地开始建设了。
    当去年高岗主席号召我们增产节约五百万吨粮食以后，我们抚顺发电厂工人们就相互议论：“怎样响应这个号召呢？”我当时就想：如果能用劣煤代替好煤，不仅能降低发电成本，而且把省下来的好煤用到其他重要工业生产上去。但是，我这个想法，不敢马上就提出来，因为我知道我们曾试烧过两次劣煤，都失败了。如果再要试烧劣煤的话，就不能再失败了。
    要想不失败，就要研究研究过去失败的原因。
    我找工人和技术人员谈，征求他们对于过去试烧劣煤的意见。我发现我们失败的原因，主要地是思想有毛病。最大的毛病是技术人员和工人结合得不好。技术人员不跟工人商量，只靠他们的书本办事；工人也不主动找技术人员，总觉得技术人员没有实际经验。为要解决这个思想问题，我们就和技术人员开了几次会，互相检讨了思想上的缺点。大家认识到：技术人员和工人必须紧紧地结合，才能搞好生产。会上，工人们就和技术人员共同研究怎样解决试烧劣煤的技术困难。
    在这样的条件下，我的信心增高了；我提出了试烧劣煤的计划，得到了大家的拥护。我们特别成立了试验劣煤的小组，组内人员又做了合理的分工，三个技术人员负责记录蒸气温度、风压等，我负责实际操作。
    开始试验时，我们碰到了不少操作上的困难。但是，我们对付困难的唯一法宝，就是多和工友们商量。我们也碰到不少技术上的困难，技术人员都帮助我们解决了。经过五天的试验，我们掺了三分之一的劣煤，果然烧成了。当我们掺用一半劣煤成功的时候，技术人员问工友们：“能不能全部烧劣煤？”工友们有信心地回答：“可以！”去年九月二十五日，我们试烧全部劣煤，终于成功了。
    今天，我们都乐意烧劣煤了。在去年仅仅因为我们用劣煤代替好煤，就给国家节省了好煤两万两千九百多吨，把燃料费减少了三分之二。
    在试烧劣煤的过程中，我深深地体会到：我们工人没有克服不了的困难。
    我相信，我出国之后，一定会不断地听到全国工人兄弟在红五月中创造新的生产成绩的喜讯。
