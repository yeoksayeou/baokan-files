Vermin in the Cultural and Academic Circles
Baisheng

In our cultural and academic circles, there are some people who, under the guise of being "experts" and "connoisseurs," and while claiming to be "studying academics" and "protecting the cultural heritage of the motherland," are actually engaged in stealing and selling precious ancient cultural relics. Some "rare book experts" specialize in stealing and selling rare books, some "oracle bone experts" specialize in stealing and selling oracle bones, and some "bronze and stone inscription experts" specialize in stealing and selling bronze and stone inscriptions. Their behavior of destroying academic research and the cultural heritage of the motherland has exposed them as vermin in the cultural and academic circles.

One researcher has successively stolen and hidden more than 200 ancient cultural relics, such as Tang Dynasty handwritten copies of Chinese classics, Tang Dynasty silk paintings, Tang Dynasty economic historical materials, and ancient Western Regions language manuscripts. These ancient cultural relics have been secretly hidden by him for a long time, some for as long as twenty years. Even today, three years after liberation, he still keeps them secret. An oracle bone "expert" not only stole more than a hundred pieces of oracle bone rubbings from the public, replacing them with fakes; but also gave them away as gifts to relatives and friends. He regarded the state's ancient cultural relics as his personal property, stealing and selling them at will. Some "connoisseurs" are no less than the "experts," and they steal and sell and hoard large quantities of the state's precious ancient cultural relics. For example, some "connoisseurs" in a certain museum stole and sold a large number of ancient cultural relics, such as gold Buddhas, silver bricks, jade articles, ancient calligraphy, Buddha banners, and vermilion ink, amounting to hundreds of pieces.

Some of the people mentioned above often collude with booksellers or antique dealers to engage in such theft and sale, making a fortune from it. Some privately hide rare ancient books, artifacts, and research materials, monopolizing them and preventing others from knowing about them, treating academic research work as a means of pursuing fame and profit. After their theft was exposed, some shamelessly said that it was merely a matter of "not distinguishing between public and private." May I ask: Can the act of stealing and hoarding a large number of the motherland's precious ancient cultural relics and destroying academic research work be described as "not distinguishing between public and private"? Everyone knows that even if it is not for the purpose of making money, but to use theft to monopolize academic research materials, monopolizing them and preventing others from studying them, it is a blatant manifestation of the bourgeois idea of harming others to benefit oneself. This is absolutely not allowed in a new democratic society.

Today, in our cultural and academic research institutions, such examples are not isolated. This bad phenomenon must be completely eliminated. Shouldn't the vermin who steal ancient cultural relics and destroy academic research work deeply reflect on themselves? Today, every person who steals ancient cultural relics should think about the cause of cultural and academic research in the motherland and return all the ancient cultural relics they have stolen to the people, otherwise the people will force them to do so.

    文化学术界的蠹虫
    柏生
    在我们的文化学术界，有一些打着“专家”、“行家”的招牌，嘴里说着“研究学术”、“保护祖国文化遗产”的人，却在那里做着盗藏或盗卖名贵古文物的勾当。有的善本“专家”就专门盗藏或盗卖善本，有的甲骨“专家”就专门盗藏或盗卖甲骨，有的金石“专家”就专门盗藏或盗卖金石。他们这种破坏学术研究和祖国文化遗产的行为，已经暴露了他们是文化学术界的蠹虫。
    有一位研究员，先后盗藏古文物如唐代汉籍写本、唐绢画、唐代经济史料、古代各种西域文字写本等达二百余件。这些古文物长期地被他私自隐匿着，有的已达二十年之久。在解放三年后的今天，他仍然秘而不宣。有一个甲骨“专家”，不但偷盗公家的甲骨拓片百余件，用赝物来掉换；而且把它们当作礼物，随便赠送给亲戚和朋友。他把国家的古文物看成了私人的家当，随便偷窃和变卖。有些“行家”呢，也并不后于“专家”，他们大量地盗卖和盗藏国家的珍贵古文物。如某博物院的一些“行家”盗卖了大批古文物如金佛、银砖、玉器、古帖、佛幡、朱墨等数百件。
    上面这种人，有的往往和书商或古玩商勾结起来，专作这类盗窃买卖，从中捞一笔钱。有的是把某种难得的古本和古物和研究资料，私自隐藏起来，独占起来，不让别人知道，把学术研究工作当作猎取名利的手段。他们的盗窃行为被人揭发以后，有人还恬不知耻地说：这只不过是“公私不分”。试问：大量地盗藏祖国的珍贵古文物、破坏学术研究工作的行为，能说是“公私不分”么？尽人皆知，即使不是为了捞钱，而用盗窃的方法，独霸学术研究材料，一人专利，不让别人研究的行为，也是资产阶级损人利己思想的露骨表现。这在新民主主义社会是决不能容许的。
    今天，在我们的文化学术研究机关中，像这样的例子并不是个别的。这种恶劣现象必须彻底消除。盗匿古文物、破坏学术研究工作的蠹虫难道还不应该深刻反省一下么？今天，每一个盗匿古文物的人，都应该为祖国的文化学术研究事业想一想，把自己盗匿的古文物，全部交还给人民，否则人民将强迫他们这样做。
