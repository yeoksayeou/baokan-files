Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th (TASS): The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union has released the following bulletin on the results of the implementation of the National Economic Development Plan for the first quarter of 1952:

The development of industry, agriculture, and trade in the first quarter of 1952 can be seen from the following materials:

I. Industry

　　The plan for total industrial output for this quarter was fulfilled by 100.4 percent overall. The percentages of fulfillment of the total industrial output plan for this quarter by various industrial ministries are as follows: Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy 102, Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy 102, Ministry of Coal Industry 100.3, Ministry of Oil Industry 99.3, Ministry of Power Stations 102, Ministry of Chemical Industry 102, Ministry of Electrical Industry 101, Ministry of Communications Equipment Industry 101, Ministry of Heavy Machine Building 98, Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry 101, Ministry of Machine Tool Building 101, Ministry of Machine and Instrument Manufacturing 104, Ministry of Construction and Road-Building Machinery Manufacturing 103, Ministry of Transport Machine Building 100, Ministry of Agricultural Machine Building 99, Ministry of Building Materials Industry of the USSR 102, Ministry of Timber Industry of the USSR 86, Ministry of Paper and Woodworking Industry 101, Ministry of Light Industry of the USSR 100.7, Ministry of Fisheries of the USSR 97, Ministry of Meat and Dairy Industry of the USSR 102, Ministry of Food Industry of the USSR 101, Industrial Enterprises of the Ministry of Cotton Growing of the USSR 105, Industrial Enterprises of the Ministry of Railways 97, Industrial Enterprises of the Ministry of Health of the USSR 102, Industrial Enterprises of the Ministry of Cinema of the USSR 106, Local Industrial Ministries and Local Fuel Industrial Ministries of the various Union Republics 101, Production Cooperatives 102.

　　The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the first quarter of 1952 exceeded that of the first quarter of 1951 by 16 percent.

　　In the first quarter of 1952, the labor productivity of industrial workers in the Soviet Union increased by 10 percent compared to the first quarter of 1951.

II. Agriculture

　　Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms are better prepared for spring plowing in 1952, and the equipment is more adequate, than in previous years.

　　Last winter, more than 500,000 tractor drivers and tractor team leaders, as well as many other personnel in agricultural mechanization and electrification, were transferred to mechanized schools for training or advanced studies, or studied in machine tractor stations and state farms. In 1951, approximately three million collective farmers and state farm workers studied in three-year agronomy and animal husbandry technology training courses.

　　Spring plowing work—spring sowing, fertilization of winter grains and perennial grasses, and spring harrowing—has been progressing smoothly in the southern regions of our country. Cotton planting in Central Asia is faster than last year.

　　The number of publicly owned livestock on collective farms and state farms continues to increase. At the end of the first quarter of 1952, the percentages by which the number of livestock on collective farms increased compared to the end of the first quarter of 1951 are as follows: cattle for consumption and dairy cows 11 percent (cows 14 percent), pigs 23 percent, sheep and goats 14 percent, horses 8 percent. The number of poultry on collective farms increased by 35 percent. During the same period, the increase in the number of livestock on state farms under the Ministry of State Farms of the Soviet Union was as follows: cattle for consumption and dairy cows 14 percent (cows 14 percent), pigs 20 percent, sheep and goats 16 percent, horses 15 percent. The number of poultry on state farms increased by 38 percent.

III. Trade

　　In the first quarter of 1952, trade in the Soviet Union continued to expand, and the retail trade plan was overfulfilled. The sales volume of state and cooperative trade organizations increased by 11 percent compared to the first quarter of 1951 (at comparable prices). The increase in sales of various goods is as follows: fish products 24 percent, eggs 28 percent, butter and other oils 10 percent, milk and dairy products 43 percent, cheese 32 percent, sugar 20 percent, confectionery 13 percent, silk fabrics 28 percent, knitwear 17 percent, leather shoes 9 percent, bicycles more than doubled, sewing machines 36 percent, radio receivers 32 percent, cameras 29 percent, watches and clocks 18 percent, gramophones 25 percent.

　　In the first quarter of 1952, the sales of agricultural products in collective farm markets, especially flour, poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and honey, increased compared to the first quarter of 1951.

　　The new achievements in industrial and agricultural production, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs in 1951 created the conditions for the fifth post-war reduction in state retail prices of food, which was implemented on April 1, 1952.

    苏联公布今年第一季生产公报
    工业总产量超过去年同期百分之十六
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：苏联部长会议中央统计局发表一九五二年第一季发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报如下：
    一九五二年第一季工、农业和贸易的发展情况，可由下列材料看出来：
    一、工业方面
    本季工业总产量计划整个说来完成了百分之一○○·四。各工业部完成本季工业总产量计划的百分比如下：钢铁工业部一○二，有色金属工业部一○二，煤矿工业部一○○·三，石油工业部九九·三，电站部一○二，化学工业部一○二，电气工业部一○一、通讯器材工业部一○一，重型机器制造部九八，汽车和拖拉机工业部一○一，母机制造部一○一，机器和器械制造部一○四，建造和筑路机器制造部一○三，运输机器制造部一○○，农业机器制造部九九，苏联建筑材料工业部一○二，苏联木材工业部八六，造纸和木工工业部一○一，苏联轻工业部一○○·七，苏联渔业部九七，苏联肉乳工业部一○二，苏联食品工业部一○一，苏联植棉部工业企业一○五，铁道部工业企业九七，苏联卫生部工业企业一○二，苏联电影事业部工业企业一○六，各加盟共和国的地方工业部和地方燃料工业部一○一，生产合作社一○二。
    苏联一九五二年第一季工业总产量超过一九五一年第一季百分之十六。
    一九五二年第一季苏联产业工人的劳动生产率比一九五一年第一季提高了百分之十。
    二、农业方面
    集体农场、机器拖拉机站和国家农场一九五二年春耕的准备工作及机器配备方面，都比以往各年为充分。
    去年冬天，拖拉机司机和拖拉机队长五十多万人，以及农业机械化与电气化方面许多其他工作人员被调到机械化学校训练或深造，或是在机器拖拉机站和国家农场中学习。在一九五一年，约有三百万集体农民和国家农场工人在三年制的农艺和养畜技术训练班中学习。
    春耕工作——春播、冬季谷物与多年生草类的施肥和春季耙田——在我国南部各区进行得很顺利。中亚细亚的植棉工作比去年加快。
    集体农场和国家农场的公有牲畜头数继续增加。在一九五二年第一季终了时，集体农场的牲畜头数比一九五一年第一季终了时增加的百分比如下：食用牛和乳牛百分之十一（牝牛百分之十四），猪百分之二十三，绵羊和山羊百分之十四，马百分之八。集体农场的家禽头数增加百分之三十五。在同一时期中，苏联国家农场部所辖的国家农场的牲畜头数增加情况如下：食用牛和乳牛百分之十四（牝牛百分之十四），猪百分之二十，绵羊和山羊百分之十六，马百分之十五。国家农场的家禽增加百分之三十八。
    三、贸易方面
    在一九五二年第一季，苏联的贸易继续扩大，零售贸易计划已超额完成。国家和合作社贸易机构的销货额，比一九五一年第一季增加百分之十一（以比较价格计算）。各项货物销售量增加的情况如下：鱼品百分之二十四，鸡蛋百分之二十八，牛油和其他油类百分之十，牛乳和乳制品百分之四十三，乳酪百分之三十二，糖百分之二十，糖果百分之十三，丝织品百分之二十八，针织品百分之十七，皮鞋百分之九，脚踏车一倍以上，缝纫机百分之三十六，无线电收音机百分之三十二，照相机百分之二十九，钟表百分之十八，留声机百分之二十五。
    一九五二年第一季中，集体农场市场的农产品销售额，特别是面粉、家禽、鸡蛋、水果、蔬菜和蜂蜜的销售额都比一九五一年第一季增加。
    一九五一年工农业生产方面获得的新成就、劳动生产率的提高及生产成本的降低，为一九五二年四月一日起实施的战后第五次减低食品的国家零售价格创造了条件。
