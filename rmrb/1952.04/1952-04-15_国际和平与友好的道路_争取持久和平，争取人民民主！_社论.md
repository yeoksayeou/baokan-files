The reply of Comrade Stalin to the questions posed by a group of American newspaper editors has provided millions of people fighting for peace with a powerful weapon. All honest people around the world see in Comrade Stalin's conversation detailed answers to the most crucial and pressing questions of our time. Comrade Stalin's reply is like a beacon, illuminating the path for the people to struggle for maintaining and consolidating peace. The historical significance of Comrade Stalin's reply lies in the fact that it is based on the most profound knowledge of the laws of social development, a comprehensive and creative analysis of the current international situation, and the most accurate assessment of the relationship between the forces of socialism and capitalism. Comrade Stalin's reply quickly reached every corner of the world and truly resonated globally. There is not a single country in the world that has not published and commented on this great document, which once again powerfully points out that the basic principle of Soviet foreign policy—a policy of international peace and friendship—is unwavering. Therefore, it is not surprising that newspapers in many countries, especially in the People's Republic of China and the People's Democracies of Europe, when publishing this document, once again pointed out the tremendous efforts made by the Soviet Union in defending peace, easing international tensions, and establishing international friendly cooperation. These newspapers recalled that the Soviet Union had repeatedly proposed peaceful solutions to the problems of Germany, Japan, and Korea, the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments and troops, and recently, the cessation of the bacteriological warfare launched by the US imperialists.

The bourgeois newspapers also had to pay attention to Comrade Stalin's historically significant reply. The "New York Times," the "New York Herald Tribune," the London "Times," the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," the Italian "Corriere della Sera," and many other newspapers could not but prominently publish Comrade Stalin's reply. American reactionary newspapers attempted to weaken the impact of Comrade Stalin's reply, but this was a futile effort, and the result was to powerfully illustrate the great significance of this reply. Despite the myriad schemes of the bought lackeys, despite the large-scale propaganda and slander carried out on the orders of the war instigators, more and more people in capitalist countries are beginning to realize that the Soviet policy is a consistently peaceful policy; that it is entirely possible to resolve all differences through negotiation rather than war; and that, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, a meeting of the heads of the major powers could be beneficial, and now is the appropriate time to unify Germany. For all good people, Comrade Stalin's reply further confirms the great achievements of the international democratic anti-imperialist camp, whose strength and influence on the course of history are growing ever greater. This precisely demonstrates that a third world war is no more imminent now than it was two or three years ago; and that despite the myriad schemes of the imperialists, their vile plots are no closer to realization than before.

Comrade Stalin's reply makes a very high assessment of the growth of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, and a very high assessment of the results of the struggles waged in recent years by the organized ranks of international peace fighters, which is entirely consistent with the actual situation. Even the warmongers cannot but take this situation into account; they cannot but take into account the influence of the great movement to defend peace on the international situation. The growing strength of the peace camp increasingly surpasses the destructive forces of imperialism that seek to plunge the whole world into the abyss of war. Socialism is not afraid of peaceful competition with capitalism. Socialism is an advanced social system that guarantees the unlimited development of productive forces; the future belongs to socialism. Those who clamor for war, who clamor for the "inevitability" of war, are the kind of people who fear the peaceful competition between the two systems, who believe that they can rely on war to enslave the people and carry out endless plunder of the people.

When American editors asked about the possibility of peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism, Comrade Stalin replied: "The peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is quite possible, provided that there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill obligations undertaken, and that the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed." In the writings of Lenin and Stalin, and in the speeches made by Soviet leaders, the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two systems has been raised more than once and theoretically substantiated. Comrade Stalin said in his speech at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "We stand for peace and the strengthening of business ties between our country and all countries, provided that these countries maintain such relations with the Soviet Union, and do not attempt to infringe on our interests." Today, Comrade Stalin's reply once again emphasizes this unchanging principle of Soviet foreign policy, and succinctly presents the conditions for fulfilling this principle. The forces of peace throughout the world are growing and becoming stronger and stronger. This gives greater courage and confidence to the common people (whom the imperialists are trying to deceive in order to bind them to the chariot of aggressive wars that will exterminate humanity); this is a great encouragement and excitement to all those who sincerely fight for peace.

History has placed before the peace movement a task of worldwide significance—the task of preventing a third world war and maintaining and consolidating peace. This great goal has generated a great force, which has transformed powerful strength into vigorous action. More and more people are participating in this movement, because they have realized that the racial, national, and religious hatred that the ruling groups of capitalist countries are trying to instill in the hearts of ordinary people only helps to divide the people who long for peace and happiness. The resolutions of the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council summarize the concrete results of the struggle for peace at the present stage. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council pointed out that the number of people who have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact has reached 603,570,000. This figure is 122 million more than the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal. In addition to this figure, it should also be stated that public opinion is increasingly firmly supporting the peaceful resolution of international problems that cause international tension. The movement to demand the conclusion of a peace pact must be strengthened. The bacteriological war launched by the US imperialists in Korea and Northeast China—the most despicable crime against humanity—must be stopped! The US and British imperialist aggressors are conspiring to destroy the peoples of various countries; defeating their conspiracy depends on the powerful actions and selfless struggles of peace advocates, and on the increasingly resolute struggles of the people. The great historical task of the Communist and Workers' Parties and all progressive forces in the world is to save mankind from the terror and destruction of a new world war.

    国际和平与友好的道路
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论
    斯大林同志对一批美国报纸编辑所提的问题的答复，使千百万为争取和平而战斗的人民得到了一件强有力的武器。全世界一切正直的人们在斯大林同志的谈话里看到了对我们这个时代的最关紧要、最为迫切的问题的详尽答复。斯大林同志的答复像一座灯塔，给人民照亮了为维护和巩固和平而斗争的道路。斯大林同志的答复的历史意义在于：这个答复是根据对社会发展规律的最深刻的知识、对目前国际局势的全面的创造性的分析、和对社会主义与资本主义力量的相互关系所作的最确切的估计而作出的。斯大林同志的答复很快就到达了全世界的每一个角落，真正得到了全世界的响应。世界上没有一个国家不发表和评论这个伟大的文件，这个文件又一次特别有力地指出：苏联的外交政策——国际和平与友好的政策——的基本原则是坚定不移的。因此毫不奇怪，许多国家的报纸，特别是中华人民共和国和欧洲各人民民主国家的报纸，在刊登这个文件的时候，又一次指出苏联在保卫和平、缓和国际紧张状态和建立国际友好合作方面所作的巨大努力。这些报纸追述，苏联曾一再建议和平解决德国、日本和朝鲜问题，缔结五大国和平公约，禁止原子武器，裁减军备和军队，最近还建议制止美帝国主义者发动的细菌战。
    资产阶级的报纸也不得不重视斯大林同志的具有历史意义的答复。“纽约时报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”、伦敦“泰晤士报”、“每日电讯与晨邮报合刊”、意大利“报信者”报，以及其他许多报纸，不能不显著刊载斯大林同志的答复。美国反动报纸企图削弱斯大林同志的答复的影响，但是这是白费心机的，结果反而有力地说明了这个答复的重大意义。尽管被收买的走卒想尽千方百计，尽管有人奉战争挑拨者的命令进行大规模造谣诬蔑的活动，资本主义国家却有愈来愈多的人开始认识：苏联的政策是始终不渝的和平政策；不用战争方式而用谈判方式解决一切分歧是完全可以做到的；正如斯大林同志所指出的，各大国首脑会谈可能会有益处，现在是统一德国的适当时机。对所有善良的人来说，斯大林同志的答复进一步证实国际民主反帝国主义阵营已得到了巨大成就，这个阵营的力量及其对历史进程的影响都愈来愈大了。这正好说明：第三次世界大战现在并不比两三年前更临近；尽管帝国主义者用尽千方百计，他们的卑劣的阴谋并没有比以前更接近于实现。
    斯大林同志的答复对和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量的成长作了很高的估价，对国际和平战士有组织的阵线在最近几年中所进行的斗争的结果作了很高的估价，这是完全符合实际情况的。甚至战争贩子也不能不考虑这种情况，他们不能不考虑伟大的保卫和平运动对国际局势所起的影响。和平阵营的日益壮大的力量越来越超过企图把全世界推入战争深渊的帝国主义破坏力量。社会主义是不怕和资本主义进行和平竞赛的。社会主义是保证生产力无限制发展的先进社会制度；未来是属于社会主义的。叫嚣战争、叫嚣战争“不可避免”的是这样一种人，他们害怕两个制度的和平竞赛，他们认为他们可以靠战争来奴役人民，对人民进行无止境的掠夺。
    美国编辑们问到资本主义和共产主义和平共存的可能性，斯大林同志回答说：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”在列宁和斯大林的著作中，在苏联领袖们发表的演说中，曾不止一次地提出并在理论上证实过两种制度和平共存的可能性的问题。斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十八次党代表大会上发表演说时说道：“我们维护和平，并巩固我国与世界各国间的业务联系，只要它们也对苏联维持着这样的关系，而不来试图侵犯我国利益的时候，我们是始终都保持这个立场的。”今天，斯大林同志的答复中又重新强调指出苏联对外政策的这个不变原则，并简明提出了履行这个原则的条件。全世界的和平力量正在增长，并且越来越强大。这使普通人民（帝国主义者正在设法欺骗这些人民，以便把他们缚在灭绝人类的侵略战争的战车上）得到更大的勇气和信心；这对于所有诚心诚意为和平而斗争的人们是一个很大的鼓舞和兴奋。
    历史已在和平运动面前提出了一个有世界性意义的任务——防止第三次世界大战、保持和巩固和平的任务。这个伟大的目标产生了伟大的力量，它把强大的力量变成了有力的行动。参加这个运动的人越来越多，因为他们已经意识到，资本主义国家的统治集团设法灌输到普通人民心中去的种族、民族和宗教仇恨，只有助于分化渴望和平与幸福的人民。世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议的决议，总结了目前阶段争取和平的斗争的具体结果。世界和平理事会执行局指出，在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的人数，已达六亿零三百五十七万。这个数字比在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数还多一亿二千二百万。除开这个数字外，还应该说明一个事实，这就是舆论越来越坚决地支持和平解决引起国际紧张局势的国际问题。要求缔结和平公约的运动必须加强。美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北发动的细菌战——对人类的最卑鄙的罪行——必须受到制止！美、英帝国主义侵略者正在阴谋毁灭各国人民，要挫败他们这种阴谋，有赖于和平拥护者的有力行动和忘我的斗争，有赖于人民越来越坚决的斗争。共产党和工人党以及全世界一切进步力量的伟大历史任务，就是把人类由新世界大战的恐怖和毁灭中拯救出来。（新华社据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十一日电）
