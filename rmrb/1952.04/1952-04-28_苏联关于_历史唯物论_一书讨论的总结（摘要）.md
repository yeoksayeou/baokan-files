Editor's Note: The publication of "Historical Materialism," a collective work by the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, edited by Professor Konstantinov, has attracted the attention of Soviet academic circles. "Pravda," "Literaturnaya Gazeta," and "Bolshevik" magazine have all published reviews. The reviews in "Pravda" and "Literaturnaya Gazeta" have been translated into Chinese (the former appeared in the September 1951 issue of "Xinhua Monthly," and the latter in the third issue of the fourth volume of "New Construction"). The fourth issue of "Philosophical Questions" in 1951 also published a report by Plekhanov and Mikhailov on the enlarged academic meeting of the Department of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences and the House of Scientists. The meeting was attended by 600 people, who discussed the book for three days and raised many opinions. The editor of the book largely accepted the opinions of the comrades attending the meeting and made some replies at the meeting. This meeting and this report have summary significance. The Chinese translation of this book has been published in separate chapters as single volumes by the People's Publishing House (the following five volumes have been published: "Historical Materialism as a Science," "Conditions of Material Life of Society," "Three Characteristics of Production," "Development of Productive Forces and Production Relations from Primitive Communes to Capitalist Society," "Marxist-Leninist Theory of Class and Class Struggle"). We are now excerpting the main points of this report here. Items that have already been translated will be simplified.

    The comrades who attended the meeting pointed out that the advantages of the book "Historical Materialism" are that it explores many issues reflecting the new laws of Soviet socialist society, and the author based the explanation of theoretical issues on the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, especially on Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism." When explaining specific issues, the author narrated the characteristics of the Lenin and Stalin stages in the development of historical materialism; the author summarized rich theoretical materials, devoted a large amount of space to the theory of socialist society, and pointed out how the role of general laws has changed under the conditions of socialist society, what new laws and new dynamics of development have emerged in socialist society, and proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist social system over the capitalist social system in the book.

    Readers can find in the book extremely detailed critiques of modern bourgeois sociology, the lackeys of the imperialist reactionaries who defend capitalism, the aggressive policies of the imperialist bourgeoisie, the frantic arms race of capitalist countries, and the attempts of the Anglo-American imperialist bloc to launch a new world war.

    On the one hand, the authors of "Historical Materialism" exposed the reactionary essence of the social development theories hostile to Marxism-Leninism, and at the same time created works that embodied the spirit of the Bolshevik Party and Soviet patriotism. Based on the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the authors made creative discussions on certain theoretical issues.

    However, this book was basically written before the publication of Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," a creative Marxist classic example. The publication of Stalin's work presented the authors with extremely important and extremely complex tasks: to explain various issues of historical materialism, especially the issue of the base and superstructure, from the perspective of Stalin's new work, and to explain the characteristics of language as a social phenomenon.

    The discussion pointed out that the authors did not fully fulfill this task. The collective writers of the book were not good at fundamentally re-editing the prepared works in a short period of time, and did not utilize the latest achievements of Marxist-Leninist science provided by Stalin in "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics." The comrades attending the meeting correctly criticized the authors of "Historical Materialism" for not using an entire chapter to elaborate on the base and superstructure - the most important issue in historical materialism. The authors neither revealed nor explained the laws of the replacement of the old bourgeois base and the old bourgeois superstructure and the creation of the new socialist base and the new socialist superstructure. The authors only stayed at the most general terms of the base and superstructure.

    In Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," many new and very important issues were raised, which elevated Marxist-Leninist theory to a new and highest stage. Stalin instructed that in analyzing social life, it is not only necessary to reveal the general things, but more importantly to reveal what is unique and exclusive to each social phenomenon, what is characteristic of each social phenomenon. The specialized characteristics that distinguish social phenomena are the most important for science. The authors should use Stalin's instruction as the basis for analyzing all aspects of social phenomena; however, the authors only applied this instruction when analyzing the laws of productive forces and production relations, class struggle and revolution. The authors should start from the ideas contained in Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" to solve the problem of the status and role of science and art in social life. The new definition of language as a science provided by Stalin has great significance for the development of historical materialism. However, all these most important issues have not been properly explained in this book. Therefore, most of the comrades attending the meeting insisted on adding important supplements to the historical materialism books, especially a special chapter on the base and superstructure, in which the inexhaustible rich ideas about this most important issue of Marxist philosophy contained in Stalin's works should be revealed and pointed out as widely as possible.

    The comrades who spoke believed that the second major shortcoming of this book is that it did not elaborate enough on many current affairs issues. When dealing with the development of people's democratic countries, the authors of this book only limited themselves to explaining the most general principles. The authors also did not make a full and detailed explanation of the characteristics of the current stage of the Chinese People's Revolution. At the end of the second section of Chapter 9, "On the Soviet Socialist State," the authors asserted that the People's Republic of China had established a revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. This definition does not fully and correctly indicate the characteristics and unique features of the state power (truly people's and democratic power) of the People's Republic of China. Comrade Stalin once said that the People's Republic of China would establish something similar to a revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.

    The authors did not pay attention to the union of the working class and the national bourgeoisie implemented in New China, although this aspect should not be missed when describing the characteristics of the development of the People's Republic of China.

    The comrades attending the meeting also pointed out that the book "Historical Materialism" should explain in more detail Lenin and Stalin's propositions and solutions regarding the relationship between reform and revolution after the proletariat seized power. Regardless of the fact that this is a very important issue, which is directly related to the issue of leaps, mutations, and gradual development raised by Stalin in "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," it is obviously not fully explained in this book. The role of the reforms implemented by the revolutionary regime is particularly great. Based on the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the authors should not only analyze the experience of socialist construction in our country in this regard, but also analyze the experience of people's democratic countries and the People's Republic of China. This is a particularly noble task in political and theoretical aspects.

    Another shortcoming of this book is that it does not fully reveal the essence of the struggle between the two camps—the democratic camp and the imperialist camp—in the post-war period. The book only explains the most general characteristics of the struggle between the two camps; but everyone understands that the issue of modern social development cannot be considered in isolation from the struggle of all nations for peace, democracy, and national independence.

    The authors did not fully point out the increase in communist power, nor did they fully reveal the historical development laws of the growth of the Communist Party's influence.

    The comrades attending the meeting also correctly pointed out that the critique of bourgeois sociology provided in this book mainly provides materials from previous eras, and the critique of modern bourgeois theories popular in Britain, France, and the United States is very weak; and exposing modern bourgeois thinkers, including the agents of Anglo-American imperialism in the workers' movement—right-wing socialists—is one of the most important tasks of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Many comrades criticized Chapter 9, "On the Soviet Socialist State," for not explaining the issue of the Soviet state in more detail. For example, when the authors explain Lenin and Stalin's views on the Soviet socialist state and its role, why did they completely fail to mention the issue of how the Soviet state strives for peace. In fact, under the current conditions, when the power and prestige of the Soviet Union have grown infinitely in solving international problems, the Soviet state has become the most important factor for peace, and the Soviet state's struggle for peace has gained worldwide historical significance. Scientifically explaining the theoretical principles of the foreign policy of socialist countries is of particular practical significance, so this issue must be discussed in a special section, rather than being limited to a few lines of perfunctory answers as the authors of this book did (see Section 5 and the last section of Chapter 9).

    The comrades pointed out that the definition of Soviet law provided in Chapter 9 equates law with morality. Because the definition of morality is "the sum of the norms of behavior of Soviet people," and the definition of law in this book is "the sum of norms (rules of behavior)." The authors obviously made a mistake on this issue because they did not critically treat the definitions in ordinary legal textbooks, such as the similar definition in the textbook "Principles of the Soviet State and Law." In the definition of law, the first thing to be mentioned is not the norms of behavior, but the sum of the laws and regulations of the Soviet socialist state, because the laws and regulations of the Soviet socialist state stipulate the rights and obligations of all members of Soviet socialist society.

    There are also serious shortcomings in Chapter 11, "Marxism-Leninism and the National Colonial Question."

    The solution of the Soviet national question and the prosperity of the Soviet socialist nation are basically correctly pointed out in this book. But the accurate theoretical summary must be supported by an analysis of the formation process of socialist nations. Moreover, the explanation of certain theoretical issues in this chapter is a bit abstract and academic, and it is divorced from those sharp issues that agitate world opinion. The national liberation struggle of the Eastern nations against the imperialist reactionaries and imperialist oppression, the solution of the national question in people's democratic countries and the People's Republic of China, the struggle of all nations in all parts of the world against the nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and racism that Anglo-American imperialism is clamoring to promote--all these important issues have not received due attention in this chapter.

    We naturally cannot ask the authors to exhaustively analyze our current national colonial movement, but the book must point out certain laws of the development of the national colonial movement in the current stage of social development.

    At the end of this chapter, the author puts China into the colonial countries, which is a serious mistake. Everyone knows that China has never been a colony, and it was no longer a semi-colonial country long before this book was published.

    In this chapter, the issue of the non-capitalist path of development in certain countries is not fully resolved; and everyone knows that this issue has particular practical significance at present.

    The explanation of the laws of development of Soviet socialist society in this book has important shortcomings: the extremely rich materials describing the characteristics of the development of the socialist mode of production are explained too briefly in many places.

    For example, in Chapter 17, "The Driving Forces of Socialist Society," the authors talk about the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of all nations, Soviet patriotism, criticism and self-criticism. The author's merit is that he pointed out that the basis of these new driving forces lies in the fact that the production relations in socialist society are completely in line with the nature of the productive forces. But the issue of how these driving forces work and where they are expressed has not been fully revealed. The author placed most of his attention on proving that these driving forces exist and that they can only appear under the conditions of the Soviet socialist system; the author proved that these driving forces are impossible in bourgeois society, which is divided into hostile and opposing classes, and is limited to proving these indisputable principles. Because the author is limited to formulaic statements, he does not specifically analyze the role of the new driving forces of Soviet socialist society.

    In the chapters on Soviet socialist society, there is no description of the characteristics of integrated mechanization; and integrated mechanization is one of the most important characteristics of socialist productive forces development that is different from capitalism, because capitalism cannot have integrated mechanization.

    In the chapter "Socialism and Communism," the material and technical foundation of communism is not fully developed. The authors of this book repeatedly quoted Stalin's famous formula of the complete conformity of productive forces and production relations in socialist society, but did not fully and exhaustively reveal this most important principle, although this principle has great significance for solving many theoretical problems of dialectical and historical materialism, especially problems such as contradictions in socialist society, the absence of explosive leaps, etc.

    Many comrades raised very important questions about transitional production relations during the discussion. These comrades emphasized when criticizing the views of this book that our country's transitional production relations should not be sought in the embryonic elements, but should be sought in the interrelationship of all components of the socio-economy. The authors were criticized because they regarded the initial forms of cooperation, such as community farming, as transitional production relations, and the reason they were based on was that these economic forms were socialist economic forms. However, the comrades who raised the criticism did not notice that although cooperatives are undeniably a socialist economic form, in their initial form (supply and marketing cooperatives) they have not fundamentally changed rural production relations. Only production cooperatives based on collective farms indicate the most fundamental change in the production relations of small commodity economies.

    Other comrades pointed out an important shortcoming, that is, the theory of the historical process is explained in the book almost only based on Western European materials. For example, when talking about slave and feudal production relations (Section 2 and Section 3 of Chapter 4), the authors of this book only explain the issue of the transition from slavery to feudalism in Western European countries. Russia is only mentioned once in these sections, and Byzantium, China, India, and Arab countries are not mentioned at all, and the authors regard slave ownership relations and feudal relations as something that has long passed. When talking about the slave system, the author mentioned ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, Urartu states [Note], etc., but not a single word was said about, for example, the slave ownership relations in the United States existed until the 1860s. The book also does not mention that in many colonial countries, the current imperialist bourgeoisie is intensifying its support and promotion of slavery.

    The authors also did not point out the many feudal remnants in modern capitalist countries, such as in the United States, these remnants are still very strong. The book does not mention that feudal remnants still dominate the agriculture of India, Japan, and certain other countries, and eliminating these feudal remnants will be one of the central tasks of the revolution in these countries. The book also does not point out how the People's Republic of China is eliminating feudal relations at present.

    In the process of discussing these issues, some comrades pointed out that the book must summarize the historical materials of Eastern countries and thereby show that historical materialism is a theory that summarizes the historical experience of all nations.

    Finally, the comrades attending the meeting pointed out the structural shortcomings of the book, that is, there is no logical connection between the chapters. The writing style of the book must also be processed. Many comrades cited many examples of unsuccessful descriptions or inaccurate definitions, and many places have examples of repetition.

    The extensive discussion and comprehensive, principled Bolshevik criticism of this book will help the author create a textbook that meets the requirements of modern science. Needless to say, the need for such a textbook is very, very urgent. (Translated by Feng Weijing)
    [Note] Urartu (ypapty) was a country that lived in the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the first millennium BC. This country is not recorded in bourgeois history books; but it occupies a very important position in the study of ancient history. See Volume 1, Chapter 2 of the "Soviet General History" edited by Pankratova for details. Avukiyev's "History of the Ancient Orient," which won the Stalin Prize, also has a special chapter on the study. --Translator.

    苏联关于“历史唯物论”一书讨论的总结（摘要）
    编者按：苏联科学院哲学研究所集体著作、康斯坦丁诺夫教授主编的“历史唯物论”一书的出版，引起了苏联学术界的重视。“真理报”、“文学报”和“布尔什维克”杂志都有过评论，“真理报”和“文学报”的评论并已先后译成了中文（前者见一九五一年九月号“新华月报”，后者见“新建设”第四卷第三期）。一九五一年第四期的“哲学问题”上又刊载了普列霍夫和米哈伊洛夫关于科学院哲学研究所和科学家之宫哲学部扩大学术会议的报告。这次会议到了六百人，讨论了三天，对这本书提出了很多意见；这本书的主编者大部分接受了出席会议各同志的意见，在会上也作过若干答辩。这次会议和这篇报告又都有总结性的意义。这本书的中译本已由人民出版社分章出单行本（现已出版以下五册：“当作科学看的历史唯物论”，“社会物质生活的条件”，“生产的三个特点”，“从原始公社到资本主义社会生产力与生产关系的发展”，“马克思列宁主义的阶级和阶级斗争理论”）。现在我们把这篇报告的要点摘译在这里。凡已有译文的从简。
    出席会议的同志指出，“历史唯物论”一书的优点是在书中探讨了许多反映苏维埃社会主义社会新的规律性的问题，作者在说明理论问题时依据了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的经典著作，尤其是依据了斯大林的“辩证唯物论和历史唯物论”这一著作。作者在说明具体问题时，叙述了历史唯物论发展中的列宁、斯大林阶段的特征；作者总结了丰富的理论材料，为社会主义社会的理论分出很大的篇幅，并指出在社会主义社会的条件下一般规律的作用怎样改变了、在社会主义社会中产生了那些发展的新的规律和新的动力，在书中证明了社会主义社会制度较资本主义社会制度的无比的优越性。
    读者在书中可以找到对现代资产阶级社会学、为资本主义辩护的帝国主义反动派的走狗、帝国主义资产阶级的侵略政策、资本主义各国的疯狂的军备竞争和英美帝国主义集团发动新的世界大战的企图，极其详尽的批判。
    “历史唯物论”的作者，一方面揭露了和马克思列宁主义敌对的社会发展理论的反动实质，同时创作了贯彻着布尔什维克党性精神和苏维埃爱国主义精神的著作。作者根据马克思列宁主义的经典著作，对某些理论问题作了创造性的论述。
    但是这一本书基本上是在斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一创造性的马克思主义经典范例发表之前写的，因斯大林这一著作的出版，在作者面前就提出了极其重要和极其复杂的任务：在书中要根据斯大林的新的著作的观点，来说明历史唯物论的各个问题，尤其是基础和上层建筑的问题，并要说明作为一种社会现象的语言的特征。
    讨论会上指出作者没有完全执行这个任务。本书集体写作者不善于在短期内基本上重新改作已准备好了的作品，利用斯大林在“马克思主义与语言学问题”中所提供的马克思列宁主义科学的最新成就。出席会议的同志们完全正确地批判了“历史唯物论”的作者，因为作者没有用整章来阐明基础和上层建筑——历史唯物论的这个最重要的问题。作者没有揭示也没有说明旧的资产阶级的基础和旧的资产阶级的上层建筑的更替及新的社会主义的基础和适合于这个基础的新的社会主义的上层建筑的创造的规律性，作者仅停留在基础和上层建筑的最一般的辞句上面。
    在斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一著作中，提出了许多新的、非常重要的问题，这些问题把马克思列宁主义理论提高到新的、最高的阶段。斯大林指示说，在分析社会生活时，不只是要揭示一般的东西，而且更要揭示那种对于每个社会现象特有的、专有的、为每一个社会现象之特征的东西。使社会现象区别开来的专门特征，对于科学是最最重要的。作者应该把斯大林的这个指示作为分析社会现象各个方面的基础；但是，对于这个指示，作者只是在分析生产力和生产关系、阶级斗争和革命的规律性时才应用。作者应该从斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一著作中所包含的思想出发，来解决科学和艺术在社会生活中的地位和作用的问题。斯大林所提供的作为一种科学的、马克思主义的新的定义，对于历史唯物论的发展具有巨大的意义。然而所有这些最重要的问题，在本书中没有得到应有的阐释。所以大部分出席的同志坚持要求在历史唯物论的书籍中要加入重要的补充，尤其是要加入关于基础和上层建筑的专章，在这一章中要尽可能广泛地把包含在斯大林各著作中关于马克思主义哲学的这个最重要问题的取之不竭的丰富思想，揭示和指出。
    发言的同志认为本书的第二个大缺点，是对于许多时事问题发挥得不够。在涉及人民民主国家的发展问题时，本书作者只限于说明最一般的原则。作者对于中国人民革命现阶段的特征也没有作充分详尽的说明。作者在第九章“论苏维埃社会主义国家”第二节末断言说中华人民共和国已经建立了无产阶级和农民阶级的革命的民主专制。这种定义没有完全正确地表明中华人民共和国国家政权（真正人民的和民主的政权）的特色和专有特点。斯大林同志曾经说过，中华人民共和国将建立某种类似于无产阶级和农民阶级的革命的民主专政。
    作者不注意新中国所实行的工人阶级和民族资产阶级的联合，虽然这个方面在叙述中华人民共和国发展的特点时是不应该放过的。
    出席会议的同志也指出了在历史唯物论中应该较详细地说明列宁和斯大林关于无产阶级夺取政权后改良和革命的相互关系问题的提法和解决。不管这是非常重要的问题，是和斯大林在“马克思主义与语言学问题”这一著作中所提出的飞跃问题，突变问题和逐渐发展问题直接联系着的，在本书中显然是说得不够充分的。革命政权所执行的改良，其作用是特别大的。作者既根据列宁和斯大林的指示，在这方面就不只是要分析一下我国社会主义建设的经验，而且也要分析一下人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的经验。这在政治方面和理论方面是一个特别崇高的任务。
    这本书的另一个缺点是没有充分揭示两个阵营——民主阵营和帝国主义阵营——在战后时期斗争的实质。在本书中只说明两个阵营斗争的最一般的特征；但是每一个人都了解，现代社会发展的问题，是不能脱离各民族为和平、民主及各民族独立的斗争来考察的。
    作者没有充分指出共产主义力量的增加，没有充分揭示出共产党影响增长的历史发展的规律性。
    出席会议的同志也正确地指出，本书对于资产阶级社会学的批判所提供的，主要是先前各个时代的材料，而对于英、法、美各国所流行的现代资产阶级的理论，批判得非常薄弱无力；而揭穿现代资产阶级的思想家、包括英美帝国主义在工人运动中的代理人——右翼社会党人——是马克思列宁主义理论的最重要的任务之一。
    有许多同志批评第九章“论苏维埃社会主义国家”中，没有较为详细地说明苏维埃国家的问题。例如作者在说明列宁和斯大林对于苏维埃社会主义国家及其作用的看法时，为什么完全放过不谈苏维埃国家如何为和平而斗争的问题。而实则在现时的条件下，当苏联的威力及其威信在解决国际问题中无限增长，苏维埃国家已成了和平的最重要的因素，而苏维埃国家为争取和平的斗争，获得了全世界历史性的意义了。科学地阐明社会主义国家外交政策的理论原则，具有特别的现实性，因此这个问题必须分出专节来讨论，而不是像本书作者所作的那样（见第九章第五节及最末一节）限于几行敷衍式的答复。
    同志们指出第九章所提供的苏维埃法律的定义，使法律和道德等同起来。因为道德的定义是“苏维埃人行为规范的总和”，而本书中法律的定义是“规范（行为的规则）的总和”。作者在这个问题上所犯的错误显然是因为没有批判地对待通常法律教科书中的定义，例如“苏维埃国家与法律原理”教本中就有类似的定义。在法律的定义中，首先要提出的，不是行为的规范，而是苏维埃社会主义国家法规的总和，因为苏维埃社会主义国家法规规定着苏维埃社会主义社会各个成员的权利和义务。
    在第十一章“马克思列宁主义与民族殖民地问题”中也有严重的缺点。
    苏联民族问题的解决，苏联社会主义民族的繁荣，在本书中指出的，基本上是正确的。但是确实的理论上的总结，必须以社会主义民族形成过程的分析来支持。而且在这章中某些理论问题的说明有点抽象和学院式的，是脱离激动着世界舆论的那些尖锐的问题的。东方各民族反对帝国主义反动势力和帝国主义压迫的民族解放斗争、人民民主国家和中华人民共和国民族问题的解决、全世界各民族反对英美帝国主义嚣张地宣传着的民族主义、世界主义、种族主义的斗争，——所有这些重要的问题，在本章中都没有得到应有的说明。
    我们自然不能要求作者详尽地分析我们现时的民族殖民地运动，但是在书中必须指出社会发展现阶段民族殖民地运动发展的一定的规律性。
    作者在本章之末，把中国放到殖民地国家中去了，这是一个严重的错误。大家知道，中国从来不是殖民地，而且在本书出版之前早已不再是一个半殖民地国家了。
    在这一章中，关于某些国家发展的非资本主义的道路问题，没有完全解决；而大家知道，这个问题现时有特别的现实性。
    本书对于苏维埃社会主义社会发展规律性的说明有重要的缺点：说明社会主义生产方式发展特征的极为丰富的资料，在许多地方解说得太简略。
    例如在第十七章“社会主义社会发展的动力”中，作者说到苏维埃社会道德政治的统一、各民族的友谊、苏维埃爱国主义、批评和自我批评。作者的功绩是指出了这些新的动力的基础在于社会主义社会中生产关系之完全适合于生产力的性质。但是关于这些动力如何起作用和它们表现在那里的问题，仍旧没有完全揭示。作者把大部分的注意放在证明这种动力是存在着的和它们只有在苏维埃社会主义制度的条件下才能出现的这种论证上；作者证明，在分裂为敌对的、互相对立的阶级的资产阶级社会中是不可能有这种动力的，而仅限于这些无可争辩的原则的证明中。作者因为仅限于公式化的陈述，因此没有具体地分析苏维埃社会主义社会新的动力的作用。
    在论苏维埃社会主义社会的几章中，没有关于综合机械化的特征的说明；而综合机械化是和资本主义不同的社会主义生产力发展的最重要特点之一，因为资本主义是不可能有综合的机械化的。
    在“社会主义与共产主义”一章中，关于共产主义的物质技术的基础问题没有充分的发挥。本书作者一再引证斯大林的社会主义社会中生产力和生产关系完全适合的有名的公式，但是没有充分详尽地揭示出这个最重要的原则，虽然这个原则对于解决辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的许多理论问题，尤其是像社会主义社会中的矛盾问题，没有爆炸的飞跃问题等等，具有巨大的意义。
    许多同志在讨论时提出了非常重要的，关于过渡的生产关系的问题。这几位同志在批评本书的观点时着重指出，我国过渡的生产关系不应在萌芽的诸成分中去找，而应在社会经济所有成分的相互关系中去找。作者之所以受到批评，也因为把合作的最初形态，例如共耕社，当做过渡的生产关系，而所根据的理由是说这些经济形态是社会主义的经济形态。但是提出批评的同志没有注意到，合作社，虽然无可争辩地是社会主义的经济形态，但是在其最初的形态中（供销合作化）还没有从根本上改变农村的生产关系，只有建立在集体农场的基础上的生产合作化，才表示最根本地改变了小商品经济的生产关系。
    另一些同志又指出了一个重要缺点，即历史过程的理论，在书中说明的差不多只是根据西欧的材料。例如在说到奴隶制的和封建制的生产关系时（第四章第二节和第三节），本书作者只说明西欧各国从奴隶制度过渡到封建制度的问题，俄罗斯在这几节中只提了一提，而拜占庭、中国、印度、阿剌伯国家则一点都没有说起，而且作者把奴隶所有制关系和封建关系当作某种早已过去了的东西来看待。当说到奴隶制度时，作者提到古代埃及、巴比伦、希腊、罗马、乌拉尔图国家〔注〕等等，但是一句都没有说到例如美国的奴隶所有制关系一直存在到十九世纪的六十年代。在书中也没有说到，在许多殖民地国家中，现时的帝国主义资产阶级在加紧支持和扶植奴隶制度。
    作者也没有指出现代资本主义国家中的许多封建主义的残余，例如在美国这些残余现在还是非常浓厚。在本书中没有说起封建残余还支配着印度、日本及某些其他国家的农业，而消灭这些封建残余将是这些国家革命的中心任务之一。本书中也没有指出中华人民共和国现时是怎样消灭封建关系的。
    在讨论这些问题的进程中，有些同志指出在书中必须总结东方各国历史的材料、并从而表明历史唯物论乃是一种总结各民族历史经验的理论。
    最后出席会议的同志指出了本书结构上的缺点，即各章之间没有逻辑的联系。本书的文体也必须加工，许多同志举出许多叙述不成功或定义不确切的例子，许多地方重复的例子。
    本书的广泛的讨论和全面的具有原则性的布尔什维克的批判，将帮助作者创作能满足现代科学要求的教本。不用说，这样的教本的需要，是非常非常迫切的。（冯维静摘译）
