Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Areas with high concentrations of overseas Chinese in Thailand have experienced continuous major fires last year, and the frequency has increased in the past two months. For example, a major fire occurred in Chantakhan, under Prachinburi Province, on February 2nd, leaving more than 2,000 Chinese and Thai victims homeless. Suphan Buri, on the northeastern line, also experienced a major fire on February 14th, affecting more than 1,000 victims. The Huangqiao District of Bangkok experienced another major fire on March 9th, with the disaster being more severe than the fire that occurred in the district in January last year, affecting 5,000 to 6,000 households and about 20,000 victims. The Bangkok Overseas Chinese Poh Teck Tung Foundation, various overseas Chinese newspapers, and various community organizations have successively established disaster relief agencies to raise funds and materials to provide relief to Chinese and Thai victims. In the process of disaster relief work in various places, overseas Chinese compatriots have been able to demonstrate their enthusiasm for helping those in distress and actively donating, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and mutual rescue. He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, has sent a telegram to express condolences to the local overseas Chinese affected by the disaster and commended the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among the overseas Chinese. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the responsible gentlemen of the Bangkok Poh Teck Tung Foundation and the Temporary Relief Agency for Fire Victims:

It has come to our attention that major fires have occurred in Chantakhan, Suphan Buri, and Huangqiao, causing serious losses to overseas Chinese compatriots. We are deeply concerned and extend our condolences to the affected overseas Chinese compatriots. Overseas Chinese compatriots are public-spirited and righteous, forming disaster relief agencies, actively donating, and providing relief to Chinese and Thai victims. It is hoped that this spirit of mutual assistance and unity will be promoted and sustained.

He Xiangning, April 2nd, 1952
