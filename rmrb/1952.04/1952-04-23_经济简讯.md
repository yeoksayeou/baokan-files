    ▲东北各地农民在爱国增产竞赛运动的鼓舞下，已提前开犁播种大田作物。辽东、辽西、热河三省，已普遍播种谷子和玉蜀黍。辽西省义县和热河省承德县等地的农民已展开了播种的竞赛。北部黑龙江、松江、吉林三省，也已陆续开始播种高粱和大豆等主要作物。各地农民接受了去年早种抗旱的经验，播种时间都比往年提前十天到半月。由于爱国增产竞赛运动的开展，各地农民播种都很细致，种后普遍踩过格子和压过磙子，增强了土地的抗旱能力。
    ▲最近东北各地连获春雨，辽东、辽西两省大部地区降雨量约一寸到二寸。久旱的黑龙江省开通等县，也在最近连降大雨。这些地区的农民正进行抢种。
    ▲陕西省关中棉区农民正在加紧播种棉田。今年关中植棉地区计划种棉三百六十多万亩。今春各地棉田的施肥量，已比去年增加了百分之十到百分之二十五。各地合作社还给农民供应了大量的化学肥料、豆饼和油渣。各地棉农在劳动模范推动下多粒选棉种，人民政府还贷放了二百多万斤良种。陕西省人民政府农林厅已把一万六千六百多架喷雾器、四百九十多架喷粉器，以及石灰硫磺制剂、棉油皂等大批药械分发到各地贷放。
    ▲贵州省贵筑县乌当区的汉族农民和苗族农民，土地改革后加强了团结互助。苗族等少数民族的农民，多住在高山上，农业生产不发达，非常穷困。这次土地改革后，住在大堡、洛湾、云锦三个村的汉族农民，自动把他们在土地改革中获得的果实四千二百万元和许多衣服、农具、耕牛等，送给了住在茅草村的苗族等少数民族的农民。为帮助苗族等民族农民解决生产中的困难，最近大堡等村农民又自动把许多秧田借给茅草村，同时，还帮助茅草村农民赶打秧田和放水。
