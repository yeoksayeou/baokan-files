    The Soviet laborers, advancing from one victory to another, have long since begun the socialist emulation aimed at completing the 1952 production plan ahead of schedule. This competition has unfolded even more broadly in welcoming May Day. In factories and mines, on collective farms and state farms, on railways and construction sites, a wave of labor enthusiasm has been swept up everywhere.

    Soviet laborers are conducting this year's socialist emulation on the basis of the achievements of patriotic labor last year. The initiators of the movement to reduce product costs in every operation, the initiators of the movement to excellently complete every production operation, and others who have made outstanding contributions in various aspects of production indicators, have all received the Stalin Prize for 1951. Their advanced experiences are being continuously applied. For example, among those who received the Stalin Prize was Busuyev, a lathe operator at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, who used high-speed cutting methods to complete 27 years of production quotas in the post-war period. Initially, his machine tool only cut 120 meters per minute, but now it has reached an astonishing speed of 2,650 meters per minute, and he is still striving to reach 3,000 meters per minute. He organized a Stakhanov school in the automobile factory, educating many high-speed lathe operators.

    The socialist emulation of Soviet laborers has become even more intense due to the fifth price reduction, because the laborers have once again seen the strengthening of the Soviet motherland's power and felt the improvement of the people's welfare in this price reduction. Workers in the mechanical processing workshop of the Moscow "Dynamo" Factory, in response to the new price reduction, decided to complete the April plan before April 25. Lukashin, the foreman of this workshop, said: "Let our workshop produce hundreds more engines for peaceful purposes and serve the further strengthening of the Soviet motherland's power!" Rossiisky, the founder of collective Stakhanovite labor and a member of the Soviet Peace Committee, said: "This is the thought and feeling of millions of Soviet workers."

    Laborers from enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, the Urals, Donbas, and other regions of the Soviet Union are striving to realize the main tasks of socialist emulation. According to the product categories stipulated by the state, they are striving to improve product quality and reduce product costs, save raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, tap potential strength, apply advanced technology, and increase labor productivity.

    Workers at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory have already produced hundreds of tons of steel beyond the plan. Workers in the third foundry of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory work for one day every five days using saved electricity. In the first mechanical processing workshop of the Leningrad Kirov Factory, 411 out of 604 operations use high-speed methods. Steelworkers in the twenty-third open-hearth furnace of the Magnitogorsk factory are engaged in a competition to reduce production costs. Ninety percent of the steel produced by the factory is smelted using high-speed methods, with the time per furnace shortened by an average of 35 minutes, and 4,000 tons of steel have been produced beyond the plan. Miners in Donbas, Kuzbas, and Karaganda are producing coal beyond the plan. Workers on the Vinnitsa Railway have also completed the April freight transport plan ahead of schedule.

    In terms of improving product quality, the experience of the Moscow "Red Seamstress" factory has received attention. Following the initiative of Sukhoverkhova, a female worker and Stalin Prize winner, this factory organized public inspection of product quality in each operation. According to her suggestion, all female workers not only carefully inspect their own operations but also check the correctness of the previous person's operation. Each group also selects several public inspectors who can not only discover small errors in the operation but also find the cause and overcome the problem. The "Red Seamstress" factory has one hundred public inspectors. As a result of implementing this initiative, 96.5 percent of the factory's products last year were of first-class quality. Most of the production groups in the factory have obtained the title of "Excellent Quality Production Group."

    In terms of conservation, a new initiative to save electricity and fuel in every operation has recently emerged. This was proposed by a group of innovators at the Moscow Ilyich Factory. Two coal transporters break up the coal sent to the boiler, allowing the coal crane to load more coal and reduce the number of crane trips, thereby reducing the electricity consumed. A lathe operator improved the cutting process and saved 33.4 kilowatt-hours of electricity in his own operation every day. Another lathe operator increased the machine's operating speed, increasing the number of parts processed from 14 to 20, saving 28 percent of electricity. An oiler rationally oiled the machine, reducing the friction of the lathe and saving 116 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day and night. As a result of such joint efforts, this factory has been working with saved fuel and electricity on the last day of each month for the past three months. In the first quarter of this year, 24 carloads of fuel and 145,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved.

    In welcoming May Day, the laborers of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations have launched a competition to "do a good job of spring plowing and strive to increase yields." As of early April, the regions of the North Caucasus, Southern Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Crimea, Moldavia, and others in the Soviet Union have begun sowing grains, fodder, and cotton. The central regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, the Urals, Siberia, and Northern Kazakhstan will soon begin field work as well. This year, Soviet agricultural laborers are better prepared than last year, possess more agricultural machinery than last year, and are entering spring plowing under such good conditions.

    In the Ukrainian Republic, the Krasnodar Territory, and the Uzbek Republic, these advanced agricultural regions, socialist emulation is being carried out enthusiastically. Laborers of collective farms and state farms in the Ukrainian Republic achieved great success last year. They completed the plan for selling grain to the state ahead of schedule, handing over nearly 933.66 million kilograms of grain more than the previous year, and greatly increased the number of publicly owned livestock. This is mainly due to the widespread efforts to increase yields. Based on last year's achievements, Ukrainian agricultural laborers guarantee that they will further increase the yields of grain and industrial crops this year. They assured Comrade Stalin that "in 1952, there will not be a single backward collective farm, a single backward machine tractor station, or a single backward district in the entire republic."

    Collective farms and state farms in the Krasnodar Territory had a good harvest last year. They completed the plan for selling grain to the state before July 25, handing over 370.19 million kilograms of grain more than the previous year, and greatly developed publicly owned livestock breeding. This is mainly due to the many benefits brought about by the merger of collective farms. Last year, it was no longer individual advanced farmers, but hundreds of collective farms and numerous districts that achieved high yields on large tracts of land. Agricultural laborers in the Krasnodar Territory recently decided to increase the yields of all crops, guaranteeing that in two or three years, the yield of winter wheat will be no less than 2,600 kilograms per hectare, corn—2,700 kilograms, rice—4,000 kilograms, and sunflowers—2,000 kilograms.

    Collective farms and state farms in the Uzbek Republic, which accounts for 70 percent of the Soviet Union's cotton production, will produce 400,000 tons more cotton this year than last year. Many collective farms and machine tractor stations completed the sowing work earlier and better than last year in eight or nine days. Many advanced production team leaders and production group leaders in the Tashkent Oblast have launched a competition: striving to ensure that the yield per hectare on the land cultivated by the production team is no less than 5,000 to 6,000 kilograms of cotton, and the yield per hectare on the land cultivated by the production group is no less than 9,000 to 10,000 kilograms of cotton.

    At the beginning of field work, tractor teams in various places are promoting the initiative to "reduce the cost of field work in every production operation." This was proposed by Ivan Shatsky, the captain of the Mikhailov Machine Tractor Station in the Krasnodar Territory and a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (whose tractor team initiated a competition several years ago to excellently complete field work to increase yields). This tractor team decided to reduce the cost of plowing work by at least 15 percent compared to the original plan this year through harmonious work, extending the life of parts, saving fuel and lubricating oil, etc., harrowing work by 10 percent, sowing work by 20 percent, pre-sowing weeding work by 10 percent, cultivating row crops by 15 percent, and harvesting work by 18 percent; they decided that each tractor (calculated at 15 horsepower) should plow 1,250 hectares of cultivated land this year (all field work is converted into plowing work calculations), and save 25 percent of machine maintenance and repair costs and 5 percent of fuel. This tractor team and the field work team of the Lenin Collective Farm it serves jointly formulated a plan to increase yields, guaranteeing that this year they will harvest 2,816 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare, 2,654 kilograms of spring wheat, 2,816 kilograms of barley, and 4,914 kilograms of threshed corn from each hectare of land.

    This is how Soviet laborers are welcoming May Day with peaceful, patriotic, and constructive labor.

    苏联迎接“五一”节的社会主义竞赛
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    从一个胜利走向一个胜利的苏联劳动者，早就开始了以提前完成一九五二年生产计划为目标的社会主义竞赛。这个竞赛在迎接五一节中更加广泛地展开着。在工厂和矿山，在集体农场和国家农场，在铁道和建筑场所，到处卷起了劳动热潮。
    苏联劳动者是在去年爱国劳动成绩基础上进行今年社会主义竞赛的。去年在每一个操作上减低产品成本的运动的发起人，优等地完成每一个生产操作的运动的发起人，以及其他在生产标志各方面作过出色贡献的人们，都得到了一九五一年度斯大林奖金。他们创造的先进经验被继续运用着。例如，在得到斯大林奖金的人们中，有一位莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的镟工布苏也夫，他用高速切削法，在战后时期完成了二十七年的生产定额。最初他的机床每分钟只切削一百二十公尺，现在则已做到每分钟切削二千六百五十公尺，并且还在争取达到每分钟切削三千公尺的惊人速度。他在汽车工厂组织了斯塔哈诺夫学校，教育出许多高速镟工。
    苏联劳动者的社会主义竞赛，由于第五次减低物价而更加紧张起来，因为劳动者们在这次减低物价中又一次看到苏维埃祖国力量的加强，又一次感受到人民福利的提高。莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂机械加工车间工人们为回答新的减低物价，决定在四月二十五日以前完成四月份计划。这个车间的领班卢卡兴说：“让我们车间为和平目的再出产几百台发动机，为苏维埃祖国威力进一步的加强而服务吧！”集体斯塔哈诺夫式劳动创始人、苏联拥护和平委员会委员罗西斯基说：“这就是千百万苏联工作人员的思想和感情。”
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克、乌拉尔、顿巴斯和苏联其他地区各个企业的劳动者，正在努力实现社会主义竞赛的主要任务。他们根据国家规定的产品门类，努力提高产品质量和减低产品成本，节约原料、材料、燃料和电力，发挥潜在力量，运用先进技术，提高劳动生产率。
    莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”工厂工人已经超过计划生产了几百吨钢铁。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂第三铸造间的工人每五天便有一天用节约下的电力工作。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂的第一机械加工车间，六百零四个操作中有四百十一个采用高速法。马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂第二十三号平炉炼钢工人进行了缩减生产费的竞赛。该厂所出的百分之九十的钢都是用高速法炼的，每炉时间平均缩短了三十五分钟，已经超计划生产四千吨钢。顿巴斯、库兹巴斯和卡拉干达的矿工都在超过计划地出产着煤。文尼茨克铁路工人也提前完成了四月份运货计划……。
    在提高产品质量方面，莫斯科“红色女裁缝”工厂的经验受到重视。这个工厂按照斯大林奖金得奖人、女工苏霍维尔霍娃的倡议，组织了在每个操作上对产品质量的公共检查。根据她的建议，所有女工不但仔细地检查自己的操作而且检查前一个人的操作的正确性。每组还选出这样几个公共检查员，她们不但能够发现操作上的细小的错误，而且能够找出原因和克服的办法。“红色女裁缝”工厂有一百名公共检查员。实行这种倡议的结果，这个工厂去年百分之九十六·五的产品都是头等质量的。全厂大半生产组取得“优等质量生产组”的称号。
    在节约方面，最近出现了在每一个操作上节约电力和燃料的新倡议。这是莫斯科伊里奇工厂一批革新者提出的。两位运煤工人把送到锅炉去的煤块打碎，使运煤吊车多装煤，减少吊车运送次数，因而减少所费电力。一个镟工改进了切削过程，每天在自己操作上节约三十三·四瓩时电力。另一位镟工提高了机器运转速度，使加工的零件从十四个增加到二十个，节约电力百分之二十八。一位上油工人合理地上油，减少车床的摩擦，每昼夜节约电力一百十六瓩时。诸如此类共同努力的结果，这个工厂三个月来每月最后一天都是用节约下的燃料和电力工作的。今年第一季节约了二十四车皮燃料、十四万五千瓩时电力。
    在迎接五一节中，集体农场、国家农场和机器拖拉机站的劳动者，展开了“很好地春耕，争取提高收获量”的竞赛。截至四月上旬，苏联的北高加索、南乌克兰、乌兹别克、塔吉克、克里米亚、摩尔达维亚等等地区，已开始播种谷物、饲料和棉花。苏联欧洲部分的中部地区、乌拉尔、西伯利亚、北哈萨克，很快地也要开始田间工作。今年，苏联农业劳动者比去年准备得更好，拥有比去年更多的农业机器，在这样良好的条件下进入春耕。
    在乌克兰共和国、克拉斯诺达边疆区和乌兹别克共和国这些先进的农业地区，社会主义竞赛热烈地进行着。乌克兰共和国的集体农场和国家农场的劳动者，去年曾取得巨大成就。他们提前完成了向国家交售粮食的计划，比前年多交给国家近九亿三千三百六十六万公斤谷物，大大增加了公有牲畜头数。这主要是由于在提高收获量方面的广泛努力。基于去年的成绩，乌克兰农业劳动者保证今年要进一步提高谷物和工业作物的收获量。他们向斯大林同志保证：“要在一九五二年使全共和国没有一个落后的集体农场，没有一个落后的机器拖拉机站，没有一个落后的区。”
    克拉斯诺达边疆区的集体农场和国家农场去年收成很好，在七月二十五日之前就完成了向国家交售粮食的计划，比前年多交给国家三亿七千零十九万公斤谷物，大大发展了公有牲畜饲养业。这主要是由于集体农场合并带来了许多好处。去年已不是单个先进农民，而是几百个集体农场，许许多多区，在大片土地上取得了高额收获量。克拉斯诺达边疆区农业劳动者最近决定提高一切农作物的收获量，保证在两三年内使冬小麦的收获量每公顷不低于二千六百公斤，玉米—二千七百公斤，稻—四千公斤，向日葵—二千公斤。
    棉花产量占全苏百分之七十的乌兹别克共和国的集体农场和国家农场，今年要比去年多出产四十万吨棉花。许多集体农场和机器拖拉机站比去年提早地、优等地在八、九天内完成了播种工作。塔什干州许多先进生产队队长和生产组组长提出了竞赛：争取使生产队所种土地上每公顷的收获量不低于五千到六千公斤棉花，生产组所种土地上每公顷的收获量不低于九千到一万公斤棉花。
    在田间工作开始时，各地拖拉机队推行着“在每一个生产操作上减低田间工作成本”的倡议。这是克拉斯诺达边疆区米海洛夫机器拖拉机站队长、苏联最高苏维埃代表伊凡·沙茨基（他的拖拉机队在几年前曾发起优等地完成田间工作以提高收获量的竞赛）提出的。这个拖拉机队决定用合拍地工作、延长零件寿命、节约燃料和润滑油等等方法，今年在耕地工作上比原定计划至少减低成本百分之十五，在耙地工作上——百分之十，在播种工作上——百分之二十，在播种前的耘地工作上——百分之十，在耕耘畦耕作物工作上——百分之十五，在收割工作上——百分之十八；决定今年每部拖拉机（以十五匹马力计算）要耕一千二百五十公顷熟地（各种田间工作都折成耕地工作计算），要节约百分之二十五机器保养修理费和百分之五燃料。这个拖拉机队和它所服务的列宁集体农场的田间工作队，共同拟定了提高收获量的计划，保证今年从每公顷土地上收冬小麦二千八百十六公斤，春小麦——二千六百五十四公斤，大麦——二千八百十六公斤，去棒玉米——四千九百十四公斤。
    苏联劳动者就是这样以和平的、爱国的、建设性的劳动迎接五一节。
