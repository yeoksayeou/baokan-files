    Zhou Yuhua, Production Minister of the YuTian County Women's Federation, Actually Shields Her Husband, the Embezzler Lou Weixin

    To the Editor: Zhou Yuhua, the Production Minister of the Democratic Women's Federation of Yutian County, Hebei Province, shields her husband, the major embezzler Lou Weixin, and refuses to hand over the ill-gotten gains.

    Zhou Yuhua is a Communist Party member, but she has been severely corrupted by bourgeois ideology. After Zhou Yuhua's husband, the major embezzler Lou Weixin, stole a large amount of state property (over 160 million yuan), he allowed Zhou Yuhua to spend it arbitrarily; Zhou Yuhua never inquired about the source of the wealth she squandered.

    After the "Three-Anti" Movement began, Zhou Yuhua not only did not stand on the position of a Communist Party member, helping her husband to confess or report his crimes, but she also did not even mention her own behavior of arbitrarily squandering money. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, without the approval of higher authorities, she privately found the criminal Lou and came up with ideas for Lou to evade the movement. Zhou Yuhua has consistently refused to return the property Lou committed to her. This shows that Zhou Yuhua has no remorse and is still attempting to live a corrupt and decadent bourgeois lifestyle. Currently, Zhou Yuhua's biggest concern is not helping her husband confess, but fearing that Lou's needs will not be met. Zhou Yuhua especially went to the market to buy a good pack of cigarettes for Lou, and also bought a summer hat for Lou to wear when it got hot. Zhou Yuhua even wanted to "retire" with the embezzled money and "live together forever" with Lou.

    From the above situation, it can be seen that Zhou Yuhua has been thoroughly corrupted by bourgeois ideology and has lost the qualities and stance that a Communist Party member should have. We have reported Zhou Yuhua's situation to the leaders of the Yutian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, but we have not received the due response. Now, we once again suggest that the relevant leaders promptly investigate and deal with this matter.

### 玉田县妇联生产部长周玉华竟袒护她的丈夫贪污犯娄维新

    玉田县妇联生产部长周玉华竟袒护她的丈夫贪污犯娄维新
    编辑同志：河北省玉田县民主妇女联合会生产部部长周玉华，袒护她的丈夫、大贪污犯娄维新，并把持赃物不交。
    周玉华是共产党员，她严重地受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀。周玉华的丈夫、大贪污犯娄维新大肆盗窃国家资财（一亿六千万元以上）之后，就给周玉华任意挥霍；周玉华从不过问她所挥霍的财物的来源。
    “三反”运动开始后，周玉华不但不站在共产党员的立场，帮助丈夫坦白或检举丈夫的罪行，连自己平日任意挥霍金钱的行为也没有谈。在“三反”运动中，她没有经过上级批准，就私自找到娄犯，为娄犯想逃避运动的主意。周玉华对娄犯给她的财物，始终把持不退。这可以说明，周玉华毫无悔过之心，仍企图过资产阶级的腐化堕落的生活。目前，周玉华最关心的，不是帮助丈夫坦白，而是怕娄犯的生活得不到满足。周玉华特别到集上买了一条好香烟送给娄犯，又特别为娄犯买了天热时带的单帽。周玉华还想带着赃款“退休”，和娄犯去“过一辈子”。
    从上述情况，可以看出周玉华已被资产阶级思想腐蚀透顶，失去了一个共产党员应有的品质和立场。对周玉华这样的情况，我们曾经向中共玉田县委领导方面反映过，但并没有得到应有的处理。现在，我们再一次建议有关领导方面迅速检查处理这件事。
