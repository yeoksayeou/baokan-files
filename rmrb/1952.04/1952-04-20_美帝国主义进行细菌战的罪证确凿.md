Editor's Note: The "Investigation Team on U.S. Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" has returned from Korea. They have collected a large amount of evidence of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare crimes. Here are articles written by members of the investigation team: Li Zong'en, Dean of the Chinese Union Medical College and expert in tropical diseases; Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and professor in the Department of Chemistry at Peking University; Gong Naiquan, Dean of Shanghai Medical College and surgical expert; Yan Jingqing, Director of the Department of Public Health at Peking University and expert in epidemiology; Yang Xiandong, agricultural expert; and Yan Renying (female), expert in maternal and child health, on their findings.

    The Crimes of U.S. Imperialism Cannot Be Denied
    Li Zong'en

    I represented the Chinese Medical Association in the investigation team on U.S. imperialist bacteriological warfare crimes, and conducted on-the-spot investigations in Korea. I saw the various containers used by the enemy to spread insects, I saw the various germ-carrying insects dropped by the enemy, I heard the confessions of U.S. military prisoners and spies, I listened to the reports of experts from the epidemic prevention and inspection teams, and I re-examined the results of their inspections with the experts of the investigation team. From this vast amount of material, we have obtained irrefutable evidence confirming that the heinous U.S. aggressors are carrying out brutal bacteriological warfare against the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, in violation of international law.

    The crime of U.S. aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare can be confirmed from the situation of their spreading insects. The temperature in northern Korea in mid-February is generally below 0 degrees Celsius, and can reach minus 19 degrees Celsius at night. In such cold weather, it is impossible for large numbers of insects to appear naturally. In fact, in areas where the enemy has not spread insects, insects are rarely seen, but in areas where the enemy has spread them, insects appear in large numbers, forming a dense zone with a certain length and width. This proves that such a situation, which does not conform to the laws of nature, can only be caused by the enemy's planned spreading. Judging from the locations where the insects appeared, most of them were in areas close to the front lines and transportation hubs, which also proves that these insects were spread by the enemy in a planned manner. Secondly, among the insects dropped by the enemy, large numbers of flies, flying ants, spiders, and other insects are often mixed together, but in nature, these insects with different living habits would not appear in large numbers together. These various phenomena that violate the laws of nature can only be explained by the enemy's spreading.

    The bacteriological evidence is even more conclusive. The experts and comrades of the epidemic prevention and inspection teams conducted thorough scientific inspection work on the specimens sent from various places, including staining smears, bacterial cultures, serum reactions, animal inoculations, and pathological sections. I and the experts of the investigation team re-examined these inspection works and affirmed that the work of the epidemic prevention and inspection team was scientific, thorough, and correct. What did these thorough and scientific inspection works prove? It proved that U.S. imperialism spread various germs in northern Korea, creating various dangerous diseases. For example, it is generally recognized that Korea is not a plague area, and the report on the epidemic situation in Korea published by the U.S. Navy Medical Department also affirmed that Korea has not had plague for many years. However, we found highly virulent plague bacilli on dead rats dropped by the enemy, and found plague cases in the same area. Isn't this ironclad evidence that the enemy spread plague bacilli?

    We also detected pure dysentery bacteria in the small fish dropped by the enemy on the hillside, and found typhoid and paratyphoid bacteria in the flies dropped by the enemy. All these were verified by thorough, precise, and scientific methods. In the face of scientific evidence, any sophistry and denial by the enemy are useless. We must use this scientific evidence to accuse the U.S. government of the brutal and barbaric crime of conducting bacteriological warfare before all mankind.

    We doctors aim to eliminate diseases; however, U.S. imperialism, in addition to burning, killing, raping, and plundering, uses disease to kill the Korean people. This proves that it is inhumane and does all kinds of evil. It is the enemy of all doctors. I call on all conscientious medical workers to wage a resolute struggle against this crime of U.S. imperialism. We must not give up until we completely defeat U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare, just as we eradicate plagues.

    Indisputable Evidence
    Zeng Zhaolun

    After suffering heavy blows on land and in the air in the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors, in an attempt to salvage their military defeat, disregarded international law and brazenly launched a bacteriological war of extermination. Since January of this year, bacteriological weapons have been used in Korea and northeastern China hundreds of times. We have obtained a large amount of documentary and physical evidence of the enemy's crime, which the enemy cannot deny at all.

    In order to cover up its crimes, the U.S. aggressors mostly used night or foggy weather to carry out sneak attacks when using bacteriological weapons. The bacterial containers used were often disguised as "empty tubes," or falsely named as flares, leaflet bombs, etc. The U.S. Air Force and artillery in Korea have been widely taught common sense about bacteriological warfare. However, the U.S. aggressors are also guilty and even keep the use of bacteriological weapons secret from the soldiers. But these tricks and various denial propagandas cannot cover up the iron facts; the fact is that the U.S. aggressors have indeed dropped and fired insects, animals, various foods and other items carrying germs and viruses many times by plane and cannon.

    Judging from the evidence currently available, the enemy’s method of spreading bacteria is mainly to spray bacteria-carrying insects directly from airplanes, or to drop them in containers. Many people have personally seen the direct spraying of airplanes many times. Several types of containers dropped have been picked up. The most common one is the four-compartment insect bomb. The enemy falsely calls this bomb a "propaganda bomb" in an attempt to deny it. But in fact, it does not contain leaflets, but bacteria-carrying insects. At the same time, the U.S. air force personnel we captured also confirmed this. Of course, what the enemy spread is not limited to bacteria-carrying insects. They also dropped rats, fish, birds, and other animals and items for use as carriers of bacteria. Some of the bombs dropped by the enemy and the shells fired made slight explosions when they landed. The shell of this bomb or shell is made of plastic or light metal (this material is not used for ordinary ammunition). Insects were found near the bomb after it exploded, which was obviously used to hold insects.

    Although the U.S. aggressors have many tricks, and although they continue to carry out heinous bacteriological warfare despite the anger of the people of the world, the Chinese and Korean people have already won the first round of victory in the anti-bacteriological war. We have full confidence and assurance in crushing the enemy's bacteriological warfare.

    The Powerful Force Against Bacteriological Warfare
    Gong Naiquan

    Our investigation team personally saw many evidences of U.S. aggressors spreading bacteria-carrying insects and poisonous substances in Korea. At the same time, we also saw the powerful forces of the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean troops to deal with bacteriological warfare.

    The Ministry of Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has formulated meticulous epidemic prevention plans and adopted effective epidemic prevention measures. Governments at all levels have established epidemic prevention institutions. Epidemic prevention and health committees have been universally organized among the people and the people's army. At present, various health campaigns, such as rat catching, disinfection, elimination of pests, and general cleaning, have been actively carried out. All residents have been vaccinated. Epidemic prevention and inspection stations have been established in various residential areas, so that people can get timely diagnosis and treatment when they get sick.

    The health work organization of the Chinese People's Volunteers is perfect, and the health work of the Volunteers has an excellent tradition. Even on the tense front lines, the soldiers often pay attention to personal hygiene, such as taking regular baths, getting haircuts, and changing shirts.

    Since the U.S. aggressors spread bacteria, all commanders and fighters of the Volunteers have greatly strengthened their epidemic prevention and hygiene work. After learning about the development of the troop hygiene campaign, I deeply realized that the Volunteer soldiers are not only heroes who kill the enemy on the battlefield, but also outstanding public health implementers. Each of their companies and catering units has formulated an epidemic prevention and hygiene covenant. In order to do a good job in environmental hygiene, they have made many amazing achievements. Take catching rats, for example. A soldier named Gong Mingzhen made eighteen rat traps by himself. They created dozens of insect catching methods, disinfection methods, and methods to quickly and thoroughly disinfect bedding. They arranged the inside and outside of their cave dwellings very neatly, making people feel like they are in a comfortable and warm house when sitting inside. There are special personnel on duty to monitor U.S. planes spreading insects and bacteria. After finding dropped insects, they are immediately put out and disinfected. They also compiled the epidemic prevention campaign into clappers, ditties, and other entertainment programs to sing, so that the hygiene and epidemic prevention campaign is popularized in every corner.

    It should also be mentioned that there are well-equipped inspection rooms in both the base and the front, and experts are responsible. In the inspection room at the front, bacterial culture, insect classification, poison analysis, pathological sectioning, and other fine research and inspection work can be done. Any tricks of the U.S. aggressors in using bacteriological warfare will be exposed in our scientists' microscopes and test tubes.

    We saw this epidemic prevention army composed of the heroic Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's Army. We believe that in the face of this powerful epidemic prevention force, the U.S. imperialists' attempt to use bacteriological warfare to cause large-scale destruction of the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean troops will never be realized. As Commander Peng Dehuai said not long ago: "We can say with certainty that the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological war is bound to suffer a shameful and disastrous defeat. Any malicious tricks of the U.S. aggressor troops cannot change their final defeat."

    Ironclad Evidence
    Yan Jingqing

    The responsibility of us health workers is to fight against diseases, especially to fight against infectious diseases that are prone to large-scale epidemics, to control them, and to eliminate them in order to protect human health. Now the mad imperialists, for the sake of the private interests of a few people, steal scientific fruits and use dangerous pathogenic bacteria as tools of war in an attempt to cause large-scale infectious diseases to achieve their aggressive goals. Such madness really wants to make mankind in the 20th century regress to the barbaric era of eating raw people!

    Some naive scientific workers once had some doubts about the fact that the U.S. imperialists used bacteriological weapons in Korea and northeastern China. They thought that although the imperialist elements were very fierce, they still did not believe that they would be so vicious as to use bacteriological warfare. But facts are the most eloquent. We conducted more than half a month of field investigation, applied scientific inspection methods, and collected a lot of documentary and physical evidence. Every fact confirmed the crime of the U.S. aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

    U.S. planes have repeatedly dropped insects, animals, and other poisonous substances in various parts of Korea and northeastern China. Many people have seen it with their own eyes. We have examined the time, place, and documentary and physical evidence in detail. We seized many containers and bacterial shells for dropping insects and other animals. These containers and bacterial shells are gelatinous, and there are copper wire mesh cages that are obviously used to hold rats. Some shells make a slight explosion when dropped, and do not break into pieces after landing, but separate into two complete parts. Around these dropped containers, a large number of various insects and other poisonous substances suddenly appeared. Including flies, black springtails, spiders, rats, fish, birds, etc. We isolated pathogenic bacteria from these dropped items. For example, typhoid bacilli and Salmonella group B bacilli were isolated from blowflies. Shigella dysenteriae bacilli were isolated from fish. Plague bacilli were isolated from rats. Can't these facts determine the crime of U.S. aggressors in bacteriological warfare?

    Korea has never had plague. Even the documents printed and distributed by the U.S. Navy itself confirm this. But after U.S. planes dropped rats, we found rats and plague patients infected with plague bacilli. Isn't this caused by U.S. bacteriological war criminals?

    In early March, the city of Pyongyang discovered true cholera patients after U.S. planes airdropped flies. Korea is not the source of cholera, and there is no infection center. Now cholera is suddenly found in the cold season. There is no other explanation except that the United States is carrying out bacteriological warfare.

    The evidence of the U.S. aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare is complete and sufficient. The evidence is ironclad, and any sophistry is futile.

    I Confirm that U.S. Imperialism is Conducting Bacteriological Warfare in Korea
    Yang Xiandong

    During my stay in Korea, I listened to the reports of the experts from the Health Department of the Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team. I and the other experts of the investigation team re-examined the work of the Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team, precisely inspected the insects, animals, and items spread by the U.S. aircraft, and inspected various containers for carrying insects. Here I want to especially state that the comrades of the Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team are all well-known experts in bacteriology, pathology, virology, parasitology, epidemiology, entomology, and chemistry in our country. They all have a high level of technical expertise and rich experience, as well as complete scientific instruments and equipment, and various reference materials. All inspection work is carried out through meticulous chemical examination steps. These include a series of scientific methods such as bacterial culture, serum reaction, animal inoculation, pathological sectioning, and clinical examination. The results of their inspection were repeatedly checked and studied by the relevant experts of this group before making the final conclusion. Therefore, this conclusion is scientific and correct. We have examined pathogenic bacteria of plague, typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery, cholera, etc. from the insects and items spread by U.S. aircraft. In addition, there are anthrax bacteria that endanger livestock and germs that damage plants.

    We interviewed many witnesses who personally saw U.S. planes spreading various poisonous insects and poisonous substances, including soldiers from the Chinese and Korean troops and kind Korean people. I personally interviewed twenty-six people. They all confirmed the crime of U.S. aircraft spreading bacteria with an unquestionable honest attitude. But they are only a small part of the tens of thousands of eyewitnesses. The eyewitnesses also included some comrades of this group. At 11:20 am on April 2, Dr. Wei Xi, a bacteriology expert of this group, and comrades Fang Xiaowen, Wu Guoying, Chen Bo, Su Zhongyi, and Lu Wenjun personally saw U.S. aircraft spreading a large number of psocoptera and leaves. Some insects and leaves fell on them.

    In Pyongyang, we conducted a detailed investigation of the incident in which Han Sang-guk, a 68-year-old resident of Pyongyang, and his two young grandsons were killed by the American-made cholera bacteria. The physicians, nurses, and several experts who performed pathological anatomy and bacterial examination of the three deceased gave us detailed reports. We heard the accusations of Han Zhu-yeon, a relative of the deceased, and Choi Doo-seop, a neighbor. They confirmed that the flies dropped by the U.S. plane fell in the courtyard of Han Sang-guk's house. When Han Sang-guk cleaned the courtyard, he opened the paper package and came into contact with the flies, thus contracting cholera and dying.

    The above documentary and physical evidence have been filmed into movies. The statements of the witnesses have been recorded. In the face of iron facts, no matter how shamelessly the U.S. imperialists quibble, they will never be able to deny it.

    U.S. Aggressors are Child-Killing Murderers
    Yan Renying

    The International Conference for the Defense of Children has closed in Vienna. The conference represents the people of sixty countries and is committed to maintaining world peace and protecting children. Hundreds of millions of fathers, mothers, and people who care about children around the world are congratulating this conference. I am a maternal and child health worker. This time I participated in the "Investigation Team on U.S. Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" to conduct an investigation in Korea. I would like to provide some evidence of the U.S. aggressors killing Korean children to mothers all over the world.

    Since the day the U.S. imperialists invaded Korea, Korean children have suffered all kinds of unimaginable disasters. Many children have become homeless orphans, their homes have become rubble, and their school sites have become bomb craters. Some children were brutally killed by American beasts for no reason; some babies cried and lay next to their mother's corpses.

    The various germs spread by the U.S. imperialists in Korea and northeastern China first harmed the elderly and children. I will only cite the accusation of Han Zhu-yeon, a resident of Pyongyang, Korea, as an example. On the night of March 4th of this year, American planes circled several times over the sky near Han Zhu-yeon's home. The next morning, when his father, Han Sang-guk, swept the street yard, he found flies wrapped in white paper in the yard, and groups of flies also fell on the thin frost on the ground on the street. The old man and his neighbors immediately caught these flies and burned them. His grandsons, Han Kyung-seop and Han Kyung-soon, both touched these flies. On March 7, all three began to vomit and diarrhea. All three died one after another on March 8. Examination results revealed cholera vibrio in the stool and small intestine of the deceased. Korea has not had cholera since July 1946; and after the American plane flew over, flies were found on the ground, and touching the flies led to cholera infection, which caused the death of an old man and two children. This fact fully proves that the crime of U.S. aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare can never be denied.

    美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证确凿
    编者按：“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”已从朝鲜回国。他们收集了美帝国主义进行细菌战的大量罪证。这里是调查团团员：中国协和医学院院长、热带病学专家李宗恩，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席、北京大学化学系教授曾昭抡，上海医学院院长、外科专家宫乃泉，北京大学公共卫生学系主任、流行病学专家严镜清，农学专家杨显东，妇幼卫生学专家严仁英（女）等就调查所得写的文章。
    美帝国主义的罪行不容抵赖李宗恩
    我代表中华医学会参加美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团，到朝鲜作了实地调查。我看到了敌人撒布昆虫的各种容器，我看见敌人投下的多种带菌昆虫，我听到了美军俘虏和特务的供词，我听取了防疫检验队的专家们的报告，并和调查团的各位专家复查了他们的检验的结果。从这大量的材料中，我们已经获得无可辩驳的证据，证实穷凶极恶的美国侵略者是在对朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军进行残暴的违背国际公法的细菌战。
    美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，从它撒布昆虫的情况便可以证实。朝鲜北部的气温在二月中，一般在摄氏零度以下，夜间可达零下十九度，在这样寒冷的天气中，自然界是不可能出现大批昆虫的。事实上在敌人没有撒布过昆虫的地方，昆虫也很少见，但是在敌人撒布过的地区，昆虫就大批地出现，而且造成一个有一定长度和宽度的密集地带。这些都证明，只有敌人有计划地撒布，才可能有这种不合乎自然界规律的情况。从昆虫出现的地点来看，多为接近前线的地区和交通要地，这亦证明这些昆虫是敌人有计划地撒布的。其次，在敌人投下的昆虫中，常是大批的苍蝇、飞蚂蚁、蜘蛛等混合在一起，但在自然界中，这些生活习惯不同的昆虫是不会大批地混合在一起出现的。这种种违反自然规律的现象，除了敌人撒布以外，不可能再有其他解释。
    细菌学方面的证据，就更确凿了。防疫检验队的专家和工作同志们对于各地送来的标本，做了周密的科学的检验工作，其中包括涂片染色、细菌培养、血清反应、动物接种、病理切片等步骤。我和调查团的专家们复查了这些检验工作，肯定防疫检验队的工作是科学的，周密的，正确的。这些周密的，科学的检验工作证明了什么呢？证明了美帝国主义在朝鲜北部撒布各种病菌，制造各种危险的疾病。譬如，世界公认朝鲜不是鼠疫区，美国海军部医务局出版的朝鲜流行病调查报告，也肯定地说朝鲜多年来没有发生过鼠疫。但是我们在敌人投下的死老鼠身上发现了毒性很强的鼠疫杆菌，并在同一地区发现了鼠疫病例。这不是敌人撒布鼠疫杆菌的铁证吗？
    我们还在敌人投在山坡上的小鱼中检出了纯痢疾菌，在敌人投下的苍蝇中发现了伤寒菌、副伤寒菌，这些都是用周密的、精确的、科学的方法所检验出来的。在科学的证据面前敌人的任何狡辩和抵赖，都是毫无用处的。我们要在全世界人类面前，以这些科学的证据，控诉美国政府进行细菌战的凶残野蛮的罪行。
    我们作医生的，是以消灭疾病为目的的；但是美帝国主义在烧杀奸淫之外，又以制造疾病来杀害朝鲜人民，这证明它是灭绝人性无恶不作的。它是一切医生的敌人。我呼吁一切有良心的医务工作者，与美帝国主义这种罪行作坚决的斗争。我们要像扑灭瘟疫一样，不彻底击败美帝国主义的细菌战，决不罢休。
    掩饰不了的罪证
                            曾昭抡
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场陆上与空中受了沉重的打击以后，妄图挽救其军事上的失败，不顾国际公法，悍然发动灭绝人性的细菌战。自今年一月起，在朝鲜及我国东北境内使用细菌武器先后计达数百次之多。对于敌人这种罪行，我们已获得大量人证物证，敌人绝对无法抵赖。
    美国侵略者为着掩盖自己的罪行，使用细菌武器时多利用夜间或阴雾的天气，进行偷袭。所用的细菌容器，往往伪称为“空筒”，或冒用照明弹、传单弹等的名称。在朝鲜的美国空军和炮兵，曾普遍被授以有关细菌战的常识。但美国侵略者却又作贼心虚，连对使用细菌武器的士兵，也要保持秘密。但这些诡计和种种抵赖的宣传，都掩不住铁的事实；这事实就是美国侵略者确实已经多次地用飞机和炮投掷与发射带有病菌、病毒的昆虫、动物、各种食品与其他物品。
    敌人撒布细菌的方法，就现在业已获得的证据来看，主要是将带菌的昆虫由飞机直接喷散，或装入容器投掷下来。飞机直接喷散，已有不少人亲眼看见很多次。投下的容器，拾到的已有好几种类型。最常见的一种就是四格式昆虫弹。这种炸弹敌人诡称为“宣传品炸弹”，以图抵赖。但事实上里面装的不是传单，而是带菌昆虫。同时我们俘获的美国空军人员也证实了这一点。当然敌人所撒布的，并不限于带菌昆虫。他们还撒下老鼠、鱼、鸟及其他动物与物品，用作带菌的媒介。敌人投下的炸弹和射出的炮弹，一部分落地炸声轻微。这种炸弹或炮弹弹壳，是用塑胶或轻金属（这种质料，是普通弹药所不用的）制成，炸开后附近发现有昆虫，显然是用来装昆虫的。
    美国侵略者虽然诡计多端，虽然不顾全世界人民的愤怒，继续进行万恶的细菌战，但中朝人民在反细菌战中业已赢得第一回合的胜利。我们对于粉碎敌人的细菌战，是完全有信心、有把握的。
    反细菌战的强大力量
                            宫乃泉
    我们调查团在朝鲜亲眼看到了美国侵略者撒布带菌昆虫和毒物的许多罪证。我们同时也看到了朝鲜人民和中朝部队对付细菌战的强大力量。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省制定了周密的防疫计划和采取了有效的防疫措施。各级政府都建立了防疫机构。在人民和人民军队中间，普遍地组织了防疫卫生委员会。目前各种卫生运动，像捕鼠，消毒，消灭害虫，大扫除等运动，都已积极地开展起来。全体居民都打了防疫针。在各居民区都设立了防疫检验站，人民发生疾病时可及时得到诊断和治疗。
    中国人民志愿军的保健工作组织是完善的，志愿军的卫生工作有着优良的传统。即使在紧张的火线上，战士们也经常注意按时洗澡，理发，换洗衬衣等个人卫生。
    自从美国侵略者撒布细菌以来，志愿军全体指战员，对防疫卫生工作大大加强了。当我了解到部队卫生运动开展的情形以后，我深切认识到志愿军战士不仅是战场上的杀敌英雄，而且是卓越的公共卫生执行者。他们每一个连队和伙食单位都订了防疫卫生公约。为了搞好环境卫生，他们做出了许多惊人的成就。就拿捕鼠来说吧，有个名叫龚明珍的战士，一个人便做了十八个捉老鼠的夹子。他们创造了数十种捕虫方法，消毒方法，创造了既迅速而又彻底的使被服消毒的方法。他们把自己住的地洞内外布置得十分整洁，令人坐在里面像置身在一间舒适而温暖的房屋里一样。对美国飞机撒布昆虫细菌，有专人值班监视。发现投下昆虫后，立即给以扑灭和消毒。他们还把防疫运动编成快板，小调和其它各种文娱节目，进行演唱，使卫生防疫运动普及到每个角落。
    还应提到的是无论在基地或前方，都有设备完善的检验室，并有专家负责。在前方的检验室里，能作细菌培养，昆虫分类，毒物分析，病理切片及其他各种精细的研究和检验工作。美国侵略者使用细菌战的任何诡计，都要在我们科学工作者的显微镜下和试验管里暴露无遗。
    我们看到英勇的朝鲜人民和中朝人民军队所组成的这支反对细菌战的防疫大军。我们相信在这个强大的防疫力量面前，美帝国主义想用细菌战造成大规模毁灭朝鲜人民和中朝部队的企图，永远不能实现。正如彭德怀司令员不久前讲的：“我们可以肯定地说，美国侵略者的细菌战一定要遭到可耻的惨败。美国侵略军任何恶毒伎俩，丝毫不能改变其最后失败的既定结局”。
    铁证如山
                        严镜清
    我们卫生工作者的责任，是向疾病作斗争，尤其是向容易大规模流行的传染病作斗争，控制它们，消灭它们，来保护人类健康。现在疯狂的帝国主义者，为了少数人的私利，竟盗窃科学果实，利用危险的致病细菌，作为战争的工具，企图引起大规模的传染病，以达到其侵略的目的。这样的丧心病狂，真是想使二十世纪的人类倒退到吃人生番的野蛮时代！
    某些天真的科学工作者，对于美帝国主义者在朝鲜和我国东北使用细菌武器的事实，曾经有过某些怀疑。他们以为帝国主义分子虽然十分凶恶，但还不相信它会穷凶极恶到使用细菌战的程度。但是事实是最雄辩的，我们作了半个多月的实地调查，应用科学的检验方法，收集了许多人证物证，每一事实都肯定了美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    美国飞机在朝鲜各地及在我国东北多次撒放昆虫、动物和其他毒物，有许多人曾亲眼看到，其时间、地点及人证物证，我们都曾详细考查。我们查获了许多撒放昆虫和其他动物的容器与细菌炮弹，这些容器与细菌炮弹壳是胶质的，有显然是装老鼠用的铜丝网笼。有的炮弹投下时爆炸声轻微，落地后并不炸碎，只是分开成为完整的两部分。在这些投下的容器的周围，突然有大量的各种昆虫和其他毒物出现。包括苍蝇、黑跳虫、蜘蛛、老鼠、鱼类、鸟类等。我们在这些投下物中分离出了致病的细菌。如从花蝇中分离出伤寒杆菌，沙门氏菌属乙群杆菌。从鱼类中分离出志贺氏赤痢杆菌。从老鼠中分离出鼠疫杆菌。这些事实，难道还不能确定美国侵略者细菌战的罪行么？
    朝鲜是一向没有鼠疫的，就连美国海军部自己印发的文件也肯定这一点。但是在美国飞机投下老鼠以后，我们就发现了受鼠疫杆菌感染的老鼠和鼠疫病人。这难道不是美国细菌战犯造成的么？
    平壤市在三月初旬，在美国飞机空投蝇类以后，发现了真性霍乱病人。朝鲜不是霍乱发源地，没有传染中心，现在突然在寒冷的季节发现霍乱，除了美国施行细菌战以外，没有其他任何解释。
    美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证已完全充分，铁证如山，任何狡辩都是徒然的。
    我证实美帝国主义在朝鲜进行细菌战
                            杨显东
    在朝鲜期间，我听取了志愿军卫生部及中国人民志愿防疫检验队各位专家的报告，我和调查团的其他专家并复查了志愿防疫检验队的工作，精密检验了美机撒布的昆虫、动物、物品，考察了各种装带昆虫的容器。这里我要特别说明：志愿防疫检验队的同志都是我国有名的细菌学、病理学、病毒学、寄生虫学、流行病学、昆虫学及化学等各方面的专家。他们都有高度的技术水平和丰富的经验，并有完备的科学仪器设备，和各项参考文献。所有检验工作，都是通过周密的化验检查步骤进行。其中包括细菌培养、血清反应、动物接种、病理切片及临床检验等一系列的科学方法。他们检验的结果，又经过本团各有关专家作了反复的检查和研究，才作出最后的结论。因而，这结论是科学的，正确的。我们从美机所撒下的昆虫和物品中，已经检验出鼠疫、伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾、霍乱等病的致病菌。此外还有危害牲畜的炭疽菌和损害植物的病菌。
    我们访问了许多亲眼看见美国飞机撒布各种毒虫和毒物的证人，其中包括中朝部队的战士和善良的朝鲜人民。我亲自接谈的有二十六人。他们都以无可怀疑的诚实态度，确切地证实了美机撒布细菌的罪行。但他们不过是成千成万个目击者中的一小部分。目击者中还包括本团若干同志。四月二日上午十一时二十分，本团团员细菌学专家魏曦博士和房晓文、吴国英、陈勃、苏中义、陆文俊等各位同志，曾亲眼看见美国飞机撒布大量襀翅虫及树叶。
    一部分虫和树叶落在他们身上。
    在平壤，我们曾详细调查了平壤居民六十八岁老人韩相国和他两个小孙子被美制霍乱菌害死的事件。诊断这三名死者的医师、护士及做病理解剖、细菌检验的几位专家，对我们作了详细的报告。我们听到死者家属韩洙演和邻居崔斗燮的控诉，他们证实美国飞机撒下的苍蝇落在韩相国家院子里，韩相国打扫院子时，打开纸包，接触苍蝇，因而感染霍乱而死亡。
    以上这些人证物证，都已拍成电影。证人的谈话，已作了录音。在铁的事实面前，美帝国主义者无论怎样无耻地狡辩，也是绝对无法抵赖的。
    美国侵略者是残害儿童的刽子手
                        严仁英
    国际保卫儿童大会在维也纳闭幕了。大会代表着六十个国家的人民，致力于维护世界和平和保卫儿童的工作。世界上亿万个父亲、母亲和关心儿童的人们，都在祝贺这个大会。我是一个妇幼卫生工作者，这次参加了“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，到朝鲜进行调查。我愿向全世界的母亲们提供一些美国侵略者杀害朝鲜儿童的罪证。
    自从美帝国主义者侵入朝鲜的那一天起，朝鲜的儿童们就遭到各种不可想像的灾难。很多孩子成了无家可归的孤儿，他们的住屋变成瓦砾，校址变成弹坑。有的儿童无故被美国野兽残杀了；有的婴儿嚎哭着躺在母亲的尸体旁边。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北所撒布的各种病菌，首先受害的就是老人和儿童。我在这里只举出朝鲜平壤市居民韩洙演的控诉作例子。本年三月四日夜间，曾有美国飞机数次在韩洙演家附近上空盘旋。第二天清晨，他父亲韩相国扫街院时，发现院中有白纸包着的蝇子，街上的地面薄霜上也落着一群群的蝇子。老人同邻居立即把这些蝇子捉起烧掉了。他的孙子韩庆爕和韩庆顺都摸了这些蝇子。三月七日，他们三人都开始上吐下泻，三人都在三月八日相继死亡。检验结果，在死者粪便及小肠中发现了霍乱弧菌。朝鲜从一九四六年七月之后，就再没有发生过霍乱；而在美机飞过之后，地面发现蝇子，摸了蝇子之后就传染到霍乱，以致使一个老人和两个儿童死亡。这一事实，充分证明美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行是决不能抵赖的。
