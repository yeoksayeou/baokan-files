    All Employees of Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station
    Demand a Swift Solution to the Toilet Construction Problem
    Comrade Editor: The environmental hygiene of our Xizhimen Railway Station freight yard is very poor. Our station's freight yard originally had no toilet. At the beginning of last year, the employees used discarded railway ties to build a very simple temporary toilet behind the gatehouse. Approximately two hundred people use this toilet every day, including freight yard employees, stevedores, and dozens of cargo owners. Because so many people use the toilet, it is difficult to maintain cleanliness. In winter, urine flows all over the ground and freezes into a sheet of ice; in summer, flies and maggots swarm, and the smell is overwhelming. We requested the relevant departments of the Beijing Railway Bureau to build a proper toilet in the year before last. They replied: "Due to budget constraints, construction cannot be carried out in 1950 and can only be included in the 1951 construction plan." We followed the instructions and made a plan, but the Beijing Railway Bureau did not reply. We sent a letter urging them on November 5th of last year, but the problem still hasn't been resolved. We then raised this issue again in this year's construction plan request. When the health authorities came to inspect, they found the toilet too dirty and wanted to close the freight yard. We went to urge them to repair it again on January 7th. This time we received the reply: "The basic construction funds for this year's construction plan have already been exhausted, and we will have to wait until next year to build this toilet." We believe that cleanliness and hygiene are very important to the health of the masses. We ask the relevant departments of the Beijing Railway Bureau to consider the urgent needs of the masses and quickly find a way to solve this problem in order to protect our health.

    北京西直门车站全体职工
    要求迅速解决修建厕所问题
    编辑同志：我们西直门车站货场的环境卫生是很不好的。我站货场原来没有厕所，前年初，职工们用废枕木才在门卫室的后面修了一个构造得很简单的临时厕所。每天使用这个厕所的约有二百人，其中包括货场职工、装卸工人以及数十名货主。因为用厕所的人多，就不容易维持清洁。这个厕所到了冬天，尿流满地，冻成一片冰；到了夏天，苍蝇粪蛆成群，气味薰人。我们在前年就要求北京铁路分局有关部门修建，他们答复说：“因预算关系，一九五○年不能修建，只可编入一九五一年度的修建计划内。”我们按照指示做了计划，但北京铁路分局没有答复，去年十一月五日我们曾函催过一次，依然没有解决了这个问题。我们随即在今年度请求修建计划中再度提出这个问题。卫生机关来检查时，见厕所太脏，要封闭货场；我们在一月七日又去催修。这次我们得到的回答却是：“今年的建设计划的基本费已没有富余了，要等下一年才能修建这个厕所。”我们想，清洁卫生对群众的健康关系是很大的。我们要求北京铁路分局有关部门考虑群众的迫切需要，迅速设法解决这个问题，以保护我们的健康。
