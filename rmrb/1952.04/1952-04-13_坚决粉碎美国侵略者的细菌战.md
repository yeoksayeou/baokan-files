    Resolutely Crush the American Aggressors' Bacteriological Warfare
    Chen Qiyuan
    Our Northeast delegation of over thirty people conducted a seventeen-day on-the-spot investigation in the Northeast region. During this period, we received assistance from the people of Northeast China and guidance from the Northeast's people's governments at all levels. Each member personally collected evidence, interviewed witnesses, and conducted on-site investigations collectively, obtaining a large amount of conclusive evidence of the U.S. imperialists spreading bacterial insects and germs in our Northeast region. We have successfully completed the task assigned to us by the Chinese people.
    In AnDong, Kuandian, Shenyang, Fushun, and other areas, we personally inspected twenty-one sites where American aircraft had dropped bacterial insects, and listened to reports from local governments and people about irrefutable evidence of American imperialism conducting bacteriological warfare against our people. We also carefully examined the bacterial and viral testing work of the hygiene and epidemic prevention institutions in Shenyang, Fushun, AnDong, and Kuandian. After repeated testing by experts, it has been verified that the insects, feathers, leaves, and other objects dropped by American aircraft contain acute encephalitis viruses, typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli, rickettsiae, anthrax bacilli, and Pasteurella. Outside the East Gate of Kuandian County, local people found fragments and spindles of bacteriological bombs dropped by American aircraft. After repeated testing and multiple corroborating evidences, we confirmed that these fragments and spindles are remnants of bacteriological bombs specially made by U.S. imperialism for containing poisonous insects.
    The various facts obtained from our on-site investigation prove that the inhumane U.S. imperialists have not only systematically and on a large scale used military aircraft to take aggressive war actions against our great motherland, the People's Republic of China; but also in their aggressive war actions against our country, systematically and on a large scale used the inhumane bacteriological warfare weapons. The purpose of the American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare against our country is not only to kill a large number of peaceful people in our country, but also to destroy a large number of our livestock, poultry, and crops. This barbaric, vicious, and despicable atrocity of U.S. imperialism is not only a blatant aggression against our country; but also violates human justice and international law. This is an unprecedentedly serious war crime.
    I and all members of the Northeast delegation call on the people of the whole country and peace-loving and just people all over the world to act together to stop the atrocities of U.S. imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare and to give the most severe just punishment to the American bacteriological war criminals.
    During our investigation work in various parts of Northeast China, we also saw the great achievements of natural science experts and the broad masses of people in Northeast China on the anti-bacteriological warfare front. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the Northeast region have formed a strong front against bacteriological warfare. Their high wisdom, their great strength, their creativity, vigilance, determination, and heroic spirit of loving the motherland and fighting bravely have deeply moved us. Workers are improving the quality of production and completing production tasks ahead of schedule; farmers are actively preparing for spring plowing and striving for timely sowing; students and teachers are enthusiastically signing up to participate in epidemic prevention and hygiene work, and some are even requesting to go to the front line to fight the American devils with blood oaths. People from all walks of life have boundless confidence in crushing the conspiracy of the American aggressors to conduct bacteriological warfare. U.S. imperialism, like in the past, has greatly underestimated the strength of the Chinese people, and the bacteriological warfare it is conducting is bound to fail.
    Let us, the people of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, unite with the peace-loving people of the world and work together to bravely advance for the complete crushing of the evil conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to attack all mankind!

    坚决粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战
    陈其瑗
    我们东北分团三十余人在东北地区进行了历时十
    七天的实地调查。在这时期，我们得到东北人民的协助和东北各级人民政府的指导，每一个团员亲自搜集证物，访问证人，集体调查现场，获得了美帝国主义在我国东北地区撒布细菌毒虫的大量罪证。我们已经胜利地完成了中国人民所交给我们的任务。
    我们在安东、宽甸、沈阳、抚顺等地区，亲自勘察了美国飞机撒下细菌毒虫的二十一个现场，听取了当地政府和人民关于美国帝国主义向我国人民进行细菌战的不可辩驳的各种证据的报告。我们又仔细地察看了沈阳、抚顺、安东、宽甸四个地方的卫生防疫检验机构的细菌、病毒检验工作。经过专家们的反复检验，已经查明美国飞机投下的昆虫及羽毛、树叶等物体中，含有急性的脑炎病毒、伤寒及副伤寒杆菌、立克次氏体、炭疽杆菌以及巴士德属杆菌。在宽甸县东门外，当地人民发现了美机投下来细菌弹的弹片和弹轴，经过了反复检验和多方面参考佐证，我们证实了这些弹片和弹轴是美帝国主义特制的装载毒虫的细菌弹残骸。
    我们实地调查所得的各种事实，证明丧失人性的美帝国主义者不但已经有计划地大规模地使用军用飞机，对我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国，采取侵略战争的行动；而且在他们对我国的侵略战争行动中，有计划地、大规模地采用了灭绝人性的细菌战武器。美国侵略者对我国进行细菌战的目的，不但企图大量地杀害我国和平人民，而且要大量地毁灭我国的家畜、家禽和农作物。美帝国主义这种野蛮的、毒辣的、卑鄙的暴行，不仅是对我国的公然侵略；而且违反了人类正义和国际公法。这是一种空前严重的战争犯罪行为。
    我和东北分团全体团员呼吁全国人民和全世界爱好和平正义的人民，一致行动起来，制止美帝国主义进行细菌战的暴行，给予美国细菌战犯以最严厉的正义制裁。
    我们在东北各地进行调查工作的期间，又看到东北的自然科学专家和广大人民群众在反细菌战线上的伟大成就。东北地区的人民在人民政府和中国共产党领导下，已经组成了强大的反对细菌战的战线。他们的高度智慧，他们的伟大力量，他们的创造性、警惕性、坚决性以及热爱祖国、英勇斗争的英雄气概，都深深地感动了我们。工人们提高生产质量，提前完成了生产任务；农民们积极准备春耕，争取及时播种；学生教员们踊跃报名参加防疫卫生工作，有些还用血书请求到前线去打美国鬼子。不论那一界的人民都有无限的信心来粉碎美国侵略者进行细菌战的阴谋。美帝国主义和过去历次一样，大大地低估了中国人民的力量，它所进行的细菌战是必定要失败的。
    让我们全中国人民在毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，与全世界爱好和平人民团结在一起，共同努力，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义进攻全人类的罪恶阴谋而奋勇前进！
