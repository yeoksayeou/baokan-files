    Fengfeng Railway Station Master's Self-Criticism for Disregarding State Property
    Editor: The letter from readers Wang Ping and four others, published in the People's Daily on March 30th, criticizing our station for treating state property with a bureaucratic attitude, is very correct, and we sincerely accept it.
    Last winter, when repairing the highway, the laborers dug up four railway tracks and were very happy to contribute them to the state. Comrade Wang Wenqing of the mining area People's Government immediately notified our station by telephone to quickly receive them. This enthusiasm for cherishing state property is worth our learning. As national railway workers, we should have welcomed such actions by the masses. However, the personnel at our station who answered the phone handled this matter with a cold attitude. This attitude fully demonstrated a disregard for state property. Our leading cadres have a serious bureaucratic work style and are usually aloof, and our education of employees is insufficient. All of this warrants deep self-criticism. Now, we have received these four railway tracks; and in the great "Three-Anti" movement, we have continued to examine our bureaucratic work style.

    峰峰车站站长对不重视国家财产的检讨
    编辑同志：三月三十日人民日报刊登了读者王平等五人的信，批评我站不该以官僚主义态度对待国家财产。这个意见是非常正确的，我们诚恳地接受。
    去年冬天修理公路时，民工们刨出了四根铁轨，很高兴地把它贡献给国家。矿区人民政府王文清同志立即用电话通知我站赶快去接收。这种爱护国家财产的热情是值得我们学习的。我们身为国家的铁路工作人员，本来对群众这种行动应该表示欢迎才对。但是，我站接电话的人员却以冷淡的态度处理这件事。这种态度十足地表现了对国家财产的不重视。我们领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，平日高高在上，对职工们教育不够。这些都值得我们作深刻的检讨。现在，我们已接收了这四根铁轨；并在伟大的“三反”运动中，继续检查了我们的官僚主义作风。    峰峰车站站长  王仲印
