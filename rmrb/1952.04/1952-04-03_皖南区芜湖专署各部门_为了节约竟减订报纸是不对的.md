Reader's Letter

    To the Editor: We have now universally established the concept of cherishing public property and are determined to overcome waste. However, some deviations have also occurred here in the anti-waste campaign. Some units have "economized" on things that should not be economized on. The widespread reduction of newspaper subscriptions by the Wuhu Administrative Office of the Southern Anhui Region is a clear example. The Wuhu Administrative Office's Industry and Commerce Section originally subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily, one copy of the Liberation Daily, and two copies of the joint Anhui North Daily and Anhui South Daily. In February, they reduced it to only one copy of the joint Anhui North Daily and Anhui South Daily. All units of the entire Administrative Office have reduced many newspaper subscriptions. I think this kind of "economy" is wrong. The most important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy in government offices is to improve work efficiency, streamline organizations, and completely eliminate extravagance and waste. To achieve these, we must first raise the political consciousness of cadres. Now, reducing newspapers, which are important tools for raising the political consciousness of cadres, is obviously wrong. Reducing newspaper subscriptions is not an isolated phenomenon; it has also been found in other areas. I suggest that relevant leaders check and correct this phenomenon.

### 皖南区芜湖专署各部门  为了节约竟减订报纸是不对的

    皖南区芜湖专署各部门
    为了节约竟减订报纸是不对的
    编辑同志：现在我们普遍地树立了爱护公共财产的观念，一致下决心克服浪费现象。但是，在反浪费运动中我们这里也发生了一些偏向，有些单位把不应节约的东西也“节约”掉了。皖南芜湖专署普遍减订报纸就是明显的例子。芜湖专署工商科原订有人民日报一份、解放日报一份、皖北日报皖南日报联合版二份，二月份减订到只剩一份皖北日报皖南日报联合版了。整个专署各单位都减订了很多份报纸。这样的“节约”，我认为是错误的。机关中的增产节约，最主要的是提高工作效率，整编机构，彻底根除铺张浪费现象。要做到这些，首先就必须提高干部的政治觉悟。现在，把提高干部政治觉悟的重要工具——报纸减掉了，这显然是不对的。减订报纸不是个别的现象，其它地区也已发现。我建议有关领导方面检查纠正这种现象。  胡春波
