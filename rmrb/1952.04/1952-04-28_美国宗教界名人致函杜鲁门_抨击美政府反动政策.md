    Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 24th (TASS dispatch): One hundred and thirty-six American religious figures recently sent an open letter to Truman, in which they severely criticized the domestic and foreign policies of the U.S. ruling clique. The letter stated: "We spend a paltry amount on peace, while we spend billions of dollars on war. The incessant war rhetoric and the production of lethal weapons increase international friction and threaten humanity. The current domestic racial and political hysteria, as well as the intolerable corruption in social life, are deepening foreigners' distrust of us." The open letter continued: "Now, we are fostering the revival of Japanese militarism and deliberately causing Germany to become a barracks again, seriously threatening world peace. ... We refuse to grant colonial peoples the right to independence and self-determination. We stubbornly refuse to recognize facts like the new China, vainly attempting to turn back the wheels of history." The open letter called for resolving differences between major powers through negotiation, and said: "Bombs and blockades cannot replace friendship and trade."

    These religious figures wrote in the letter: The "erroneous policies" pursued by the U.S. ruling clique "can only mean continued bloodshed and the loss of precious resources." They called for the United States to stop playing "the role of the head and protector of reactionaries." The open letter was signed by representatives of various denominations in the United States, including: Professor Kermit Eby of the University of Chicago, President Gisler of Andover Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, and Reverend Hedd, Executive Secretary of the Philadelphia Evangelical Church's Christian Education Council, among others.

    美国宗教界名人致函杜鲁门
    抨击美政府反动政策
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：一百三十六名美国宗教界名人不久前曾给杜鲁门公开信一封，他们在信中严厉抨击了美国统治集团的内政和外交政策。信中说：“我们把少得可怜的一点钱用于和平，而把成十亿的美元用于战争。不绝于耳的战争论调和杀人武器的生产，增加着国际摩擦，威胁着人类。目前国内种族和政治的歇斯底里以及社会生活中令人难以容忍的腐化情形使外国人对我们的不信任日益加深。”公开信继续说：“现在，我们正在助长日本军国主义的复活，并特意促使德国重新变成兵营，使它严重威胁世界和平。……我们拒绝给予殖民地人民以独立和自决的权利。我们顽固地拒绝承认像新中国这样的事实，白费心机地试图倒转历史车轮。”公开信呼吁以谈判的方式解决大国间的分歧，并说：“炸弹和封锁不能够代替友谊和贸易。”
    这些宗教界人士在信中写道：美国统治集团所执行的“错误政策只能意味着要继续流血和使宝贵的资源遭到损失”。他们呼吁使美国不再扮演“反动派的头子与保护人的角色”。在公开信上签字的有美国各教派的代表，其中有：芝加哥大学喀尔米特·爱比教授，马萨诸塞州安道维尔神学院院长吉塞尔克，费城福音教会基督教教育问题理事会执行秘书希德牧师等人。
