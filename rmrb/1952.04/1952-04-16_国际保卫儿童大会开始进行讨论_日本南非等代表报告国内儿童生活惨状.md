Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 15th dispatch: The International Conference for the Defence of Children began its discussion of reports at the afternoon session on the 13th, chaired by Professor Gilpin (England).

    Mrs. Johnson, the representative of the Union of South Africa, described the plight of her country's people in her speech, saying: In the Union of South Africa, 87 percent of the land belongs to Europeans. Indigenous people live in a state of starvation and are deprived of their civil rights. The country has laws to register livestock, but no laws to register births and deaths of people, because the mortality rate is very high, and registering deaths would be detrimental to the rulers. Indigenous children are malnourished and receive no medical care. Sixty percent of children die before the age of one, and most children cannot attend school.
    Ms. Keoagi, the representative of Cyprus, then spoke, describing the cruel exploitation of the local people and the tragic fate of children. She emphasized that the Cypriot authorities do not care about the welfare of children, only about building airports and barracks. However, the movement to defend peace and demand improved living conditions for working people is rising across the country.
    Ms. Matsumoto Takako, the representative of Japan, described in her speech the terrible consequences of the Second World War for the Japanese people. She said: The terrible ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are calling on us to fight with all our strength to defend peace and oppose a separate peace treaty with Japan. As a result of preparations for war, the living conditions of Japanese children are deteriorating. Last year, 300,000 children were sold in Japan, and the phenomenon of employing child labor is very common. Many children cannot go to school, and the people receive almost no medical assistance. War preparations and the cost of maintaining the American occupation forces account for more than 60 percent of the national budget; while appropriations for education and other cultural needs are less than 1 percent of the budget. Japanese children are eating very badly, lacking clothes and shoes, and are even forced to give blood transfusions to American soldiers injured in Korea. However, Matsumoto emphasized that the movement to defend peace and oppose militaristic education is expanding in Japan. Let us join the ranks of the struggle for the happiness of children. Aggressors, you are not allowed to act in Korea! American troops get out of Japan! We welcome the demand for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers.
    At this point in the meeting, Kang Keqing (China) took over as chair.
    Dimitriu, the Vice Minister of Health of Romania, spoke at the meeting, describing the Romanian government's concern for children. For example, the number of nurseries in Romania this year is six times that of 1934, the number of kindergartens is three times that of 1939, and the number of primary schools is six times that of 1939. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that 74 billion lei (Romanian currency) will be used to improve the cultural level of the working people, of which 40 billion lei will be used for education.
    Fuad, a member of the Syrian Committee for the Defence of Children, pointed out in his speech: Syria has abundant resources, yet millions of working people live in incredible poverty. The child mortality rate is as high as 40 percent. Diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhus, smallpox, rickets and other diseases are rampant, and there is only one doctor for every fifteen villages in the country. Trafficking in children is very common. Eighty percent of the national population is illiterate. Poverty and hunger are mainly due to the huge expenditure for war preparations, which accounts for 60 percent of the Syrian government's budget. Fuad said: The Syrian people are resolutely fighting against the threat of a new war, and they denounce the American imperialists for using bacteriological weapons in Korea.
    Representatives from the United Kingdom, Venezuela, Finland, Canada, Cameroon, Albania, Australia, Italy and other countries also spoke in the discussion.

    国际保卫儿童大会开始进行讨论
    日本南非等代表报告国内儿童生活惨状
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际保卫儿童大会十三日下午会议，开始讨论报告，由吉尔朋教授（英国）担任主席。
    南非联邦代表约翰逊夫人在发言中叙述本国人民的惨状说：在南非联邦，百分之八十七的土地属于欧洲人。土著民族生活在饥饿状态中，而且被剥夺了公民的权利。国家有登记牲畜的法律，但是没有登记人口出生和死亡的法律，这是因为死亡率非常高，登记死亡对统治者不利。土著民族的儿童都缺乏营养，得不到医药照顾，百分之六十的儿童在一岁以前就夭折了；大多数儿童不能进学校读书。
    塞浦路斯岛代表凯奥雅吉接着发言，叙述了当地人民遭受残酷剥削和儿童的悲惨命运。她强调说：塞浦路斯当局毫不关心儿童的福利，只关心建筑飞机场和兵营。但是，保卫和平和要求改善劳动人民生活条件的运动，正在全国高涨起来。
    日本代表松本鹰子在发言中叙述了第二次世界大战给日本人民带来的可怕后果。她说：广岛和长崎的可怕废墟正在向我们大声疾呼，要我们全力为保卫和平和反对单独对日和约而斗争。由于进行战争准备的结果，日本儿童的生活状况越来越恶劣了。日本去年有三十万儿童被贩卖，雇用童工的现象非常普遍。许多儿童进不了学校，人民差不多没有得到医疗帮助。战争准备和维持美国占领军的费用占了国家预算百分之六十以上；而用在教育和其他文化需要方面的拨款却不到预算的百分之一。日本儿童吃得很坏，缺乏衣服和鞋袜，而且还被迫给在朝鲜受伤的美国士兵输血。但是，松本强调说：保卫和平和反对军国主义教育的运动，正在日本扩大中。让我们加入为儿童的幸福而斗争的阵营吧。侵略者们，不准你们在朝鲜动手！美国军队从日本滚出去！我们欢迎关于缔结五大国和平公约的要求。
    会议至此，由康克清（中国）担任主席。
    罗马尼亚卫生部副部长狄米丘在会上发言，叙述罗马尼亚政府关怀儿童的情形。例如，罗马尼亚今年托儿所的数目相当于一九三四年的六倍，幼儿园的数目相当于一九三九年的三倍，初等学校的数目为一九三九年的六倍。五年计划规定以七百四十亿列伊（罗币）作为提高劳动人民文化水平的经费，其中就有四百亿列伊用在教育方面。
    叙利亚保卫儿童委员会委员佛阿德在发言中指出：叙利亚拥有丰富的资源，然而数百万劳动人民却生活在令人难以置信的贫苦状态中。儿童的死亡率高达百分之四十。白喉、肺结核、斑疹伤寒、天花、佝偻症和其他疾病流行，国内每十五个村庄才有一个医生。贩卖儿童的事件非常普遍。全国人口有百分之八十是文盲。贫困和饥饿主要是由于准备战争的庞大开支，这笔经费占叙利亚政府预算的百分之六十。佛阿德说：叙利亚人民正在坚决地为反对新战争的威胁而斗争，他们痛斥在朝鲜使用细菌武器的美国帝国主义者。
    在讨论中发言的，还有英国、委内瑞拉、芬兰、加拿大、喀麦隆、阿尔巴尼亚、澳大利亚、意大利和其他国家的代表。
