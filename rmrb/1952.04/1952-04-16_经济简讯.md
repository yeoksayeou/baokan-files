Economic Briefs

	▲ The industrial enterprises under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry have basically completed their production plans for the first quarter. According to preliminary statistics from the Planning Department of the Department of Industry, the actual total value of production completed in the first quarter was equivalent to 101% of the planned total value for the first quarter. Among the 50 major products, 38 completed or exceeded their planned targets.
	▲ During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have seen a large number of new records and inventions in production. For example, the wire drawing section of the second workshop of the Northeast No. 8 Machine Factory created three new output records in a row in early March, with the daily output of iron wire, the section's main product, exceeding last year's highest record by 24.51%. Zhang Jinling, a model worker at the foundry branch of the Qiqihar Railway Factory, created four tools, each of which significantly improved work efficiency. Among them, the "sand mixer" can produce a mold in 20 seconds, increasing work efficiency by 75 times.
	▲ Guangdong Province has seen a general increase in the yield per unit area of sugarcane and jute, two economic crops, and many outstanding records of high yields have emerged. In the Pearl River Delta, a major sugarcane-producing area, the average yield per mu last year reached 7,000 to 8,000 jin, more than ten times the pre-war average of 400 to 600 jin per mu. He Guisheng, a farmer in Shunde County, set a provincial record with an average yield of 23,000 jin per mu. In terms of jute, Guangdong Province's output last year reached 156% of the 1950 output. Yuan Zhiming, a farmer in Dongguan County, set a record of 689 jin of dry jute fiber per mu per crop (two crops per year).

    ▲东北人民政府工业部所属工矿企业第一季度的生产计划已基本完成。据工业部计划处初步统计，第一季度实际完成的生产总值，相当于第一季度计划总值百分之一百零一。五十种主要产品中，完成和超额完成计划的共达三十八种。
    ▲在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，东北国营厂矿在生产方面出现了大批的新纪录和发明创造。如东北第八机器厂第二车间伸线工段在三月上旬连续创造三次产量新纪录，该工段主要产品铁线的日产量超过去年最高纪录百分之二十四点五一。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂铸工分厂劳动模范张金灵创造出四种工具，每种工具都使工作效率有显著提高。其中“翻砂机”，用二十秒钟就能做一个活，使工作效率提高了七十五倍。
    ▲广东省甘蔗、黄麻两种经济作物单位面积产量普遍提高，并出现许多优异的丰产纪录。盛产甘蔗的珠江区去年每亩平均产量已达七千到八千市斤，超过抗战前每亩平均四百斤到六百斤的产量十多倍。顺德县农民何桂胜创造了每市亩平均产量二万三千斤的全省最高纪录。在黄麻方面，广东省去年产量已达一九五零年产量的百分之一百五十六。东莞县农民袁志明创造每亩一造（每年两造）产干麻皮六百八十九市斤的最高纪录。
