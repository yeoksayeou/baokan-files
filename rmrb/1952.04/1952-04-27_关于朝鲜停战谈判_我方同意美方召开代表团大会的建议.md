Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 26th: Because the other side, during the Fourth Item Agenda Staff Meeting, insisted on its unreasonable demand to detain over 100,000 of our captured personnel, fundamentally overturning the basis of the administrative meetings, and further exploited the form of the administrative meetings to conduct its habitual tricks of deceiving and hoodwinking the people of the world, our side formally announced the cancellation of administrative meetings and the commencement of open negotiations at the Fourth Item Agenda Staff Meeting on the 25th. However, after our side announced the resumption of open meetings, the other side requested an indefinite adjournment, openly delaying the progress of the meeting. Our side sternly denounced the other side's attempt to openly delay the meeting at the meeting on the 25th. At 7 PM on the 25th, the other side, in the name of the chief representative, suggested holding a delegation conference at 11 AM on the 27th. Our side notified the other side on the morning of the 26th that it agreed to the other side's suggestion to hold a delegation conference.

At the Third Item Agenda Staff Meeting on the 26th, the other side continued to insist on its unreasonable demand to restrict airport facilities within Korea, which interfered with our internal affairs, and refused to accept our side's reasonable solution to the issue of neutral country nominations. The meeting made no progress.

    关于朝鲜停战谈判
    我方同意美方召开代表团大会的建议
    【新华社开城二十六日电】由于对方在第四项议程参谋会议上，坚持其扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的无理要求，根本推翻了行政性会议的基础，而又利用行政性会议的形式，进行其欺骗蒙蔽世界人民的惯技，我方在二十五日第四项议程参谋会议上，正式宣布取消行政会议，进入公开谈判。但在我方宣布恢复公开会议后，对方又要求无限期休会，公然拖延会议的进行。我方在二十五日的会议上，严词指斥对方这种公然拖延会议的企图。二十五日下午七时，对方以首席代表的名义，建议在二十七日上午十一时召开代表团大会。我方在二十六日上午通知对方，同意了对方召开代表团大会的建议。
    二十六日第三项议程参谋会议上，对方继续坚持其所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的干涉我方内政的无理要求，并拒绝接受我方对于中立国提名问题的合理解决方案，会议无进展。
