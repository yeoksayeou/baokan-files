    Beijing Machine Factory Worker Ding Zhengui Makes Two Tools to Improve Work Efficiency

    Comrade Editor: Ding Zhengui, a worker in the forging department of the Beijing Machine Factory, recently accepted the task of making bullhead planer helical gears. In the past, when workers did this kind of work, they used the old method of making a model on the anvil and then taking it to the machine shop for machining, which was both time-consuming and wasteful of materials. He thought he had to create a tool to improve work efficiency. He found a piece of iron weighing more than ten kilograms and made a concave helical gear die in the middle, with a through hole below the concave part. After machining in the machine shop, he heated the helical gear material red and put it into the die to hammer. Using this tool not only saved time and materials, but also made the gear slope. The seventy-five helical gears he made were originally planned to require three hundred work hours, but only took sixty work hours, increasing work efficiency by more than four times and saving more than one hundred kilograms of material.

    In the second batch of tasks he accepted to make mine car handle rings, he spent several nights of effort and successfully developed a tool to improve work efficiency. He made a convex shape on the iron block, inserted the convex part into the anvil eye, and then made a straight through eye on the outside, and installed a rocker, with a handle ring-shaped pliers tool made at one end of the rocker. Using this tool, three people can twist more than eight hundred handle rings a day, an increase of more than six hundred compared to before, increasing work efficiency by more than three times.

    北京机器厂工人丁振贵制成两种提高工作效率的工具
    编辑同志：北京机器厂锻工部工人丁振贵，最近接受了打牛头刨斜齿轮的任务。以往工人做这种活时，沿用旧的方法，在砧子上打好模型，再拿到机工部去车铣，这既费工又费料。他想着非要创制一种提高工作效率的工具不可。他找了十几斤重的一块铁，中间作了一个凹型的斜齿轮的闷子，在凹处下边再打一个通眼；经过机工加工车铣以后，再把斜齿轮的料烧红，下到闷子里捶打。用这个工具，不但省时省料，连齿轮坡度也闷出来了。他所作的七十五个斜齿轮，原计划需要三百个工时，结果只用了六十个工时，提高工作效率四倍多，还节省了一百多斤材料。
    在他接受的第二批作鑛车手把环的任务中，他费了好几晚的心血，又研究成功了一种提高工作效率的工具。他在铁块上作了一个凸型，把凸出的部分插到砧子眼里去，外面再打个直通眼，按上一个摇杠，在摇杠的一头打成一个手把环型的钳型工具。用这个工具工作，三个人每天可绞八百多个手把环，较前增加六百多个，提高工作效率三倍多。
