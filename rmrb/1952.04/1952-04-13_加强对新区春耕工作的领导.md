    Strengthen Leadership in Spring Ploughing in New Areas
    Judging from the investigation materials from Sanpu Township, Liling County, Hunan Province, there are still many problems in the production work of this township. The most urgent problem is the lack of means of production such as draught cattle, farm implements, and fertilizers for the newly liberated poor and hired peasants; water conservancy and pest control work have not yet been completed; and some farmers still lack confidence in increasing production, and their conservative thinking is still very serious. Sanpu Township is a township in Hunan's new district that has done a relatively good job in production work in the high-yield demonstration county; the problems it faces are also general problems in the vast rural areas of the new district. If these problems are not resolved, it will be difficult to ensure that the vast number of peasants in the new district can achieve "sowing in time and planting in a timely manner," which will hinder this year's agricultural bumper harvest.
    How can these problems be solved? The peasant masses in Sanpu Township have provided very good experience: after seven poor peasant households, including Liu Qikui, and three middle peasant tenant households organized themselves, the problems of draught cattle, farm implements, and fertilizers were solved; the three mutual aid groups in this township did a better job in pest control, fertilizer accumulation, and other work than ordinary farmers. As long as they are organized, water conservancy work can also be done well. Therefore, during the spring plowing season, leading cadres in the new areas must lead the peasants to develop various temporary and seasonal mutual aid groups on a large scale based on the original mutual assistance habits such as helping with work, exchanging work, and sharing plows, under the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This can not only solve the current difficulties, but also lay the foundation for further development of production in the future. Of course, in the new areas where land reform has just been completed, peasants do not yet have relatively established mutual aid habits, and it is currently impossible to organize them universally. Therefore, other methods should also be used to supplement, such as advocating free lending, helping peasants concentrate idle funds to buy farm implements, and organizing equal value exchange of labor between people and cattle, all of which are feasible methods for regulating and increasing the means of production. In addition, local governments should quickly provide economic assistance to some areas and farmers with particularly difficult circumstances.
    In order to ensure this year's agricultural bumper harvest, it is necessary to educate the peasants about patriotic production and production policies, promote high-yield experiences, and enable peasants to change some of their misconceptions about patriotic production. The desire of the liberated peasants to increase production is very urgent. As long as ideological education is strengthened, their certain erroneous ideas are overcome, and confidence in high yields is established, their production enthusiasm will be improved, and many difficulties in production will be easily resolved.

### 加强对新区春耕工作的领导

    加强对新区春耕工作的领导
    从湖南醴陵县三铺乡的调查材料看来，这个乡的生产工作中还有不少问题。其中最迫切的问题是新翻身的贫雇农民缺乏耕牛、农具、肥料等生产资料；水利、治虫等工作还没有完成；有些农民增产的信心还不高，保守思想还很严重。三铺乡是湖南新区丰产示范县生产工作做得较好的一个乡；它所存在的问题，也是广大新区农村一般性的问题。这些问题如不加以解决，便很难保证广大新区农民都能做到“不违农时，及时播种”，就会妨碍今年的农业丰产。
    这些问题要怎样来解决呢？三铺乡的农民群众已提供了很好的经验：刘启逵等七户贫农、三户佃中农组织起来以后，耕牛、农具、肥料等问题都解决了；这个乡的三个互助组，治虫、积肥等工作都做得比一般农民好。只要组织起来，水利工作也是可以做好的。因此，在春耕季节，新区的领导干部必须领导农民，在原有的帮工、换工、插犋等互助习惯的基础上，在自愿和互利的原则下，大量发展各种临时性、季节性的互助组。这样既可解决目前的困难，同时也可以为今后进一步发展生产打下基础。当然，在土地改革才完成不久的新区，农民还没有比较定型的互助习惯，普遍组织起来目前还不可能。因此，还要辅以其他办法，如提倡自由借贷、帮助农民集中游资伙买农具、组织人和牛的等价换工等，都是调剂和增加生产资料的可行的办法。此外，对一些困难特别多的地区和农民，当地政府应迅速在经济上给以帮助。
    为了保证今年农业丰产，必须对农民进行爱国丰产和生产政策的教育，宣传丰产经验，使农民改变他们对爱国丰产的一些错误认识。翻了身的农民增产的要求是很迫切的，只要加强思想教育，克服他们的某些错误思想，树立了丰产信心，他们的生产积极性提高，生产上的许多困难也就容易解决了。
