    Excellent Rural Female Teacher - Tian Guizhi
    Lu Shu
    In March 1948, Tian Guizhi, just graduated from senior primary school, participated in education work in Yongsheng Village, Shengli Township, Second District of Dunhua County, Jilin Province - her hometown. She was only seventeen years old at this time.
    When the masses in Yongsheng Village heard that Tian Guizhi was assigned to be a teacher, they started making a fuss. Some said, "People are really 'promising' fast, a kid with a runny nose is also a teacher!" Others said, "Who doesn't know her little bit of 'culture'! A little girl dares to teach!" Still others said, "Don't let the children go to school! What can she teach!"
    At that time, the school building was three thatched houses, one end of which was also inhabited by villagers; five sets of broken tables and chairs were scattered in the corner of the wall; the wall was like the bottom of a pot, and one's hand would be black upon touching it - this was the blackboard in the past. When she arrived at the school, five or six students were rolling around in a ball in the classroom. Seeing her come in, they all ran away giggling. Seeing this situation, she felt a little discouraged. The school was dilapidated, the students were naughty, her own cultural foundation was shallow, she was young, and she was native-born... How could this teacher be "a teacher"! After thinking about it all night, she thought, what would happen in the future if she were stopped by difficulties without doing a day's work? Finally, she made up her mind: no matter what, she must run the school well! The next day, she cleaned the classroom, repaired the broken tables and chairs, arranged them neatly, and found a piece of wood from her own home, brushed it with a layer of soot, and hung it on the wall (as a blackboard). It looked like a school. Then she went to each house to encourage students to go to school, but after a lot of talking, she only persuaded eighteen students to come. But she was still very happy, so she decided to start class.
    This news spread throughout the village like the wind. Before Tian Guizhi started class, the windows were full of people. By the time she stood in front of the students, people outside the window were already pointing and gesturing, talking and laughing! This one said, "That doesn't look like a teacher, she's not even as tall as the students!" That one said, "She can't 'hold the scene' at all, those students don't look like they're in class!" Tian Guizhi was really ashamed and wanted to cry. But she endured it, pretending not to hear, and continued to teach. The class went on, but sometimes when she walked on the street, some villagers and students would call her by her "childhood name" behind her back. Almost every day, students would tell her that someone wanted to test her, or someone wanted to try her. One day, a loafer named Yu Zemin came with two weird characters used for "drawing talismans and chanting spells" to ask her, but before Tian Guizhi could answer, he shook his head and left. In less than two days, the small village was buzzing with "The female teacher was stumped!" In addition, Liu, a blind man who had taught in a private school, also wanted to squeeze Tian Guizhi out of the way so that he could be the teacher in this village, so he secretly encouraged the students to say, "Don't go to school, what can a little girl know? I bet she can't even do a math problem I give her. When she's gone, I'll teach you, only two classes a day, I guarantee I'll teach you better than her!" From then on, fewer and fewer children went to school, and the school was on the verge of collapse.
    Some village cadres also looked down on her, and the school had nothing it needed. Every time she went to the village cadres to discuss school expenses, the village cadres always said, "What expenses, what for, what can you teach two and a half students, just disband it!" Or they would just hum and ha and ignore it. But she didn't lose heart and kept persisting. And she said, "I will teach even if there is only one student left."
    The salaries of village primary school teachers were borne by the masses at that time, and they were given one hundred catties of rice per month. But only half was given each month. It was really difficult for a family of four to maintain. But she still had to take money from her meager salary to buy office paper and chalk, etc.
    During the busy season of summer weeding, the school house leaked rain. Knowing that the masses were busy with summer weeding, she led the students, mud in one hand and sweat in the other, to repair the school inside and out to make it look brand new. From then on, some of the masses secretly praised her, "It's really not easy, she also has some skill in farm work!" Their opinion of her changed somewhat. In 1949, the masses held a meeting and decided to give the school one "qing" of farmland, and the grain harvested would be used as school expenses. During the spring plowing, the masses were very busy, so she held the plow herself and led the students to plant. When hoeing and cutting, she took the lead in doing it herself. The one "qing" of school farmland, from planting to harvesting, did not require the masses to worry or exert themselves. The whole village looked at her with new eyes! They admired Tian Guizhi's attitude towards labor. Some villagers said to the loafers in the village, "Look, the female teacher is going to the fields, what are you still wandering around for!"
    In winter, the school had no firewood, so she led the students to chop it themselves, braving the wind and snow to haul it back. Seeing her doing this, the villagers couldn't stand it anymore and took the initiative to haul firewood for the school and apologized to Tian Guizhi, saying, "We don't care about the school enough!"
    Slowly, the school began to take shape. According to the requirements of the province's new type of standardization, classroom teaching was strengthened. Because she knew her own cultural level was low, she first strengthened her pre-class preparation work and learned the new words in "National Language" from beginning to end. If she encountered something she couldn't understand, she would cross the river to the Linjiang Village Primary School five miles away to find Teacher Zhao to study, regardless of wind or rain. Sometimes, when District Cadre Comrade Tan came to the village to work, she would always find him to study and ask about the courses she didn't understand. She said, "Only if you study well can you teach the students well." Now she has completed all the senior primary school textbooks and is studying junior high school textbooks, and is determined to complete the senior high school courses within three to five years. In class, she tries her best to make the children learn well and achieve complete understanding. Outside of class, she participates in activities with the children and conducts collectivism and discipline education anytime, anywhere. Therefore, at the end of 1949, the children's academic performance and discipline were generally improved: children who didn't like to study started studying hard; most children could also keep accounts for their families; and children who used to fight and curse also helped their parents with work. Many children were admitted to senior primary schools in the county seat. This had never happened in Yongsheng Village before. In this way, the small village was once again a sensation. Everyone said, "It's right to entrust the children to Teacher Tian!" In this way, the school changed from one class to two classes, and the number of students increased from a dozen to eighty, with all school-age children in the village attending school.
    In teaching, Tian Guizhi attaches great importance to studying and researching educational policies and instructions from higher authorities. Based on the actual situation of the school, she formulated a specific teaching plan. She is able to correctly and effectively implement patriotic education. At the same time, she does not limit patriotic education to the classroom or to words; she is also good at grasping typical examples in various movements to educate students and influence the masses. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched, she found examples of those who suffered the most under the puppet Manchukuo regime among the masses in her village to explain the principle of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect the country. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, she told students and the masses that exposing special agents and bad guys was an act of patriotism. Therefore, children's thoughts and feelings are clear about what to love and hate. Student Li Desheng wrote in a sentence in "National Language": "I will catch the counter-revolutionary and hand him over to the government!" In addition, she can also educate children according to their will and personality. Student Li Shende said that he wanted to be a soldier who defends the motherland in the future. In response to his will, Tian Guizhi often encouraged him to exercise. Li Shende intensifies his exercise after class, and now his little face is rosy and he has become a very strong child.
    In the winter of 1949, the winter school began. After this task was assigned, the village cadres found it troublesome and said, "Learning culture is a matter for the school, don't look for us." The central group leader said, "If the winter school is set up, it will cost more lamp oil!" The masses were afraid of delaying work and were unwilling to participate in learning. But she accepted the task of running the winter school without hesitation. At this time, in addition to using acting and holding parent meetings to publicize the importance of cultural learning, she also spent her spare time with young people, teaching them to sing and telling them stories. Sometimes, after teaching a song for a few days, everyone still couldn't learn it, so she took this opportunity to inspire everyone: "It's so inconvenient not to be able to read, if you could read, you would have learned it a long time ago!" Due to constant inspiration, many young people were the first to sign up to participate in the winter school. When the winter school was set up, the masses would quickly take action if there was a major event in the village after it was publicized through the winter school. When the village cadres saw that the winter school was really working, they took the initiative to find Teacher Tian to help solve the two major difficulties of the winter school - lamp oil and firewood.
    Some places collapsed after the winter school was transformed into a regular people's school. But the people's school in Yongsheng Village not only did not collapse, but the number of students increased from more than twenty to more than forty. This is partly because of Tian Guizhi's constant encouragement, but more importantly, it has gained the active support of the village cadres. They said, "If the people's school collapses, things will be difficult to handle!" She has always been serious and proactive in her work in the people's school. No matter whether it is windy or rainy, she always goes to the people's school first to wait for the students. If the people's school has no lamp oil, she would rather not light the lamp in her own home and take the lamp oil to school to use. Because she regards the cultural life of the peasants as a part of her entire work, the people's school has been developing all the time. Now there are fifty-nine students, and all the young people in the village have participated in the study. More than half of the elderly have also participated in the study. Some students have already recognized more than 1,800 characters, and the least has recognized more than 300 characters. Twenty illiterate people can now read newspapers and write notes. Therefore, it has become a typical people's school in the county.
    Village cadre Wang Fengjiang was the worst cadre in the village. He wandered around all day long, his work was not energetic, and the masses called him "spirit tablet," "false activist," and "double-dealer." Tian Guizhi often contacted him, mobilized him to go to the people's school, improve his culture, and improve his class consciousness. After her continuous help and education, Wang Fengjiang has now become a "good cadre" in Yongsheng Village.
    Now, if the school has something to do, the masses will take the initiative to help without Tian Guizhi having to say anything. When the school added classes, there was a shortage of tables and chairs, and they were all filled within a few days. One day, the school was drying wheat, and it suddenly started raining heavily in the evening. Tian Guizhi hurriedly gathered the students. At this time, three or four people were already helping to stack the wheat in the rain, one of whom was Yu Zemin, who had tested her characters in the past. Tian Guizhi repeatedly told them to go back, but they all said, "The school's things are the same as ours!" They didn't go back until all the wheat was stacked.
    In the spring of 1950, Tian Guizhi was selected as a model worker in winter school in the district, and in June of the same year, she joined the New Democratic Youth League (now serving as the organization member of the Yongsheng Village Youth League Branch). Since then, she has become the leading cultural backbone of the entire village.
    Because Tian Guizhi works diligently for the masses, she cannot take care of the family's production, so the masses proposed to help Tian Guizhi economically, but Tian Guizhi declined. The masses came up with other ways to help her. The masses knew that her family lacked labor, so they automatically organized themselves and took turns fetching water for her family. Although she repeatedly tried to stop them, the masses have persisted in doing so until now.
    In the past three years, Tian Guizhi has contributed all her energy and wisdom to the cause of education and has led a backward village to progress, which has been warmly supported by the masses of the entire village. Therefore, in November 1951, she was again selected as an excellent teacher of the first class in Jilin Province. People have already seen that Tian Guizhi is an excellent representative of rural primary school teachers. She provides valuable school-running experience for rural primary schools, and she is a model of running schools with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods. Her experience shows that rural teachers should not only run school education well, but also actively help farmers improve their culture. She affirmed, "There are no backward masses. If you see the masses are backward, it just shows that your work has not been done well, you have not understood, organized, educated, and helped them." Therefore, all rural primary school teachers should learn from Tian Guizhi and complete the glorious and arduous task given to us by the motherland.

    优秀的乡村女教师—田桂芝
    卢抒
    一九四八年三月，田桂芝刚从高小毕业，就在吉林省敦化县第二区胜利村永胜屯——她的家乡，参加了教育工作。这时她才十七岁。
    永胜屯的群众听说派田桂芝来当教员，就哄嚷开了。有的说：“人要‘出息’真快，拖鼻涕的孩子也当教员了！”还有的说：“谁不知道她那点‘文化水’！几天的小丫头也敢教学！”更有的说：“快别叫孩子上学啦！要她能教出个什么来！”
    当时校舍是三间草房，一头还住着老乡；五套破桌椅，零零散散地堆在墙根角；墙像锅底一样，一摸一手黑，这就是过去的代用黑板。她到学校时，五六个学生正在教室里滚成一团，看她进来，都嘻嘻哈哈地跑开了。她看到这个情况，真有些泄气。校舍破旧，学生淘气，自己文化底子浅，年岁又小，又是土生土长……这个教师可怎么“当”啊！寻思了一宿，她一想，一天工作没干就叫困难难住，今后可怎么办？终于她下定了决心：无论如何，一定要把学校办起来！第二天她把教室清扫了一下，把破桌椅修理整齐摆好，又从自己家里找了一块木板来，刷上一层锅底灰，挂在墙上（当黑板），看来像个学校了。然后她到各家动员学生上学，但费了不少唇舌，只动员来十八个学生。可是她仍然是很高兴的，于是决定开始上课。
    这个消息，像风一样刮遍了全屯。没等田桂芝上课，窗外就站满了人。等她站到学生面前的时候，窗外已经指手划脚、连说带笑地吵开了！这个说：“那像个老师样，都没学生高！”那个说：“一点儿‘压不住场’，看那些学生那里像个上课样啊！”田桂芝真羞愧得想哭。但她忍耐着，装着没听见似地继续讲课。课是讲下去了；但有时她在街上走，有的群众和学生却在后面叫她的“乳名”。差不多每天都有学生告诉她，不是这个要来考考她，就是那个要来试试她。有一天有个叫于泽民的二流子找来两个“画符念咒”用的古怪字问她，但还没等田桂芝响声，就一幌脑袋走了。不两天，小屯子各处哄嚷着：“女老师叫人考住了！”另外有个教过私塾的刘瞎子，趁这个机会也想挤走田桂芝，好来当这屯的教员，所以就背地鼓动学生说：“你们别上学啦，小毛丫头能会个啥，不信我出道算术她都算不了。等她走了，我教你们，一天只上两堂，保管比她教得好！”从这时起，上学的儿童一天比一天少，眼看学校就垮了。
    有的屯干部也瞧不起她，学校是要啥也没有。她每次去找屯干部研究学校办公费用，屯干部总是说：“什么办公不办公的，两个半学生有什么教头，解散就得了！”再不就是一哼二哈地不理这回事。可是她并不灰心，一直坚持着。并表示：“剩一个学生我也教。”
    村小学教员的薪资，当时都由群众负担，每月给一百斤米。可是每月都是只给一半。全家四口人真是难能维持。但她还要从微薄的薪金里，拿出钱来买办公纸和粉笔等等。
    在夏锄农忙的时候，学校房子漏雨，她知道群众都忙着夏锄，就领着学生泥一把、汗一把地把校舍修理得里外一新。从此有的群众暗暗称赞：“真不简单，庄稼活还有两手！”对她的看法才算有些转变。一九四九年，群众开会决定给学校一垧学田地，打了粮食就作为学校经费。春耕时群众都很忙，她自己扶犁，领着学生种。铲地和割地时，自己带着头干。一垧多学田从种到收，没用群众操心费力。全屯都对她另眼相看了！佩服田桂芝这种劳动态度。有些老乡对本屯二流子说：“看，女先生都下地啦，你还游逛啥！”
    冬天了，学校没炉柴，她领着学生自己砍，冒着风雪往回拉。她这样做，老乡们看不过去了，都纷纷自动地给学校拉柴火，并向田桂芝检讨说：“我们太不关心学校了！”
    慢慢的，学校有些眉目了。根据全省新型正规化的要求，加强了课堂教学。她因为自己文化低，首先加强了课前准备工作，把“国语”上的生字，从头到尾都学会了。如遇到弄不通的地方，不管刮风下雨也要过江到五里外的临江村小学去找赵老师研究。有时区干部谭同志来屯工作，她总是找来研究询问些不懂的课程。她说：“只有自己学好，才能把学生教好。”现在她已把高小课本全部学完，正在学习初中课本，并下定决心，要在三、五年内，学完高中课程。课内，她想尽办法，使孩子们学习得好，达到全部领会的程度。课外，和孩子们一起活动，随时随地进行集体主义和纪律教育。因此，在一九四九年末，儿童的成绩和纪律性普遍有了提高：不爱学习的孩子用心学习了；多数孩子也能给家里记账了；打架骂人的孩子也帮助爹妈干活了。不少儿童考上了县城高小。这在永胜屯来说，是从来没有过的事。这样一来，小屯子又轰动开了。都说：“把孩子交给田老师没错！”这样，学校由一个班变成两个班，学生由十几名增加到八十名，全屯学龄儿童全部入学了。
    在教学上，田桂芝是极重视学习和研究教育方针以及上级指示的。她根据学校实际情况，订出了具体的教学计划。她能够正确而有效地贯彻爱国主义教育。同时她不把爱国主义教育局限在课堂或口头上，她还善于在各种运动中抓住典型事例去教育学生，影响群众。当抗美援朝运动掀起之后，她在本屯群众中找出在伪满受苦最深的实例，来说明抗美援朝保家卫国的道理。在镇压反革命运动中，她告诉学生和群众检举特务坏蛋就是爱国行动。因此，在儿童的思想感情上，是爱憎分明的。李德胜同学在“国语”造句中写道：“我抓住反革命分子，就送交政府！”此外，她还能根据孩子们的意志和性格，进行培养教育。李申德同学表示：将来要当一名保卫祖国的战士，针对他的这种意志，田桂芝经常鼓励他锻炼身体。李申德下课后就加紧运动，到现在小脸红润润的，已经成为一个很结实的孩子了。
    一九四九年冬，开始搞冬学。这个工作布置下来以后，屯干部嫌麻烦，说：“学文化是学校的事，别找我们。”中心组长说：“冬学搞起来，又该费灯油了！”群众怕耽误活，也都不愿参加学习。但她毫不犹疑地接受了搞冬学的任务。这时她除去利用演剧和开家长会来宣传文化学习的重要性以外，她还在课余时间和青年在一起，教他们唱歌，给他们讲故事。有时教歌教了几天大家还学不会，她就借此机会来启发大家：“不认字多不方便，你们要认识字，早就学会了！”由于不断启发，就有不少青年首先报名参加了冬学。冬学搞起来了，屯里有个大事小情，通过冬学一宣传，群众很快就会动起来。屯干部一看冬学真起作用，就都自动来找田老师，帮助解决冬学的两大困难——灯油和柴草。
    冬学转为常年民校，有些地方转垮了。可是永胜屯的民校不但没垮，学员还由二十几名发展到四十多名。这一方面是因为田桂芝不断地鼓动，但更主要的是取得了村干部的积极支持。他们说：“民校垮了，事情就不好办啦！”她对民校工作一贯认真主动，不论刮风下雨，她都先到民校等着学员。民校没有灯油，宁可自己家不点灯，把灯油拿到学校来用。由于她把农民的文化生活，作为她整个工作的一部分，因而民校一直在发展，现在已有五十九名学员，全屯青年全部参加了学习。老年人也有半数以上参加了学习。有的学员已经认识了一千八百多字，最少的也认到三百多字。有二十个文盲到现在能看报纸和写便条了。因此，成为全县的典型民校。
    屯干部王凤江，在屯里是最差的干部，一天游游逛逛，工作不起劲，群众称呼他是：“牌位”、“假积极”、“两面光”。田桂芝就经常和他接触，动员他上民校，提高他的文化，提高他的阶级觉悟，经过她不断地帮助和教育，现在王凤江已经成为永胜屯“呱呱叫”的好干部了。
    现在，学校有事不用田桂芝响声，群众就主动地帮助办。学校增班后缺桌少椅，没过几天就全部添齐。有一天学校晒麦子，傍晚忽然下起大雨，田桂芝赶忙召集学生，这时早有三、四个群众顶着雨在帮助给垛麦子了，其中有一个就是过去考她字的那个于泽民。田桂芝百般叫他们回去，他们都说：“学校的东西，还不是和我们的一样！”一直把麦子垛完了才回去。
    一九五零年春，田桂芝被选为全区的冬学模范工作者，同年六月便参加了新民主主义青年团（现担任永胜屯团支部组织委员）。从此，她成为全屯文化的领导骨干。
    由于田桂芝辛勤地为群众工作，不能兼顾家庭的生产，于是群众提议：要在经济上帮助田桂芝，但被田桂芝谢绝了。群众就另想办法来帮助她。群众都知道她家缺少劳动力，就自动组织起来，轮流给他家挑水。她虽然一再阻止，但群众一直坚持到现在还这样做。
    三年来，田桂芝把自己的全部精力和智慧贡献给教育事业，并把一个落后的村庄引向了进步，受到了全村群众的热烈拥护。因此，在一九五一年十一月，又被选为吉林省的一等优秀教师。人们都已经看到：田桂芝是乡村小学教师中的一个优秀的代表。她给乡村小学提供了宝贵的办学经验，她是用革命精神和革命办法办学的典型。她的经验说明：农村教师不仅要办好学校教育，更应该积极地帮助农民提高文化。她肯定地说：“没有落后的群众。如果你看到群众落后，那正说明你的工作没有作好，没去了解、组织、教育和帮助他们。”所以，所有乡村小学教师，都应该向田桂芝学习，完成祖国给予的光荣而艰巨的任务。
