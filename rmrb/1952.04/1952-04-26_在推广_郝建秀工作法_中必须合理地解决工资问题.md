In the process of promoting the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," it is essential to simultaneously and reasonably resolve the wage issues of fine yarn workers. This is one of the keys to whether the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" can be deeply promoted and consolidated.

Currently, the unreasonable wages of fine yarn workers in many textile factories are a significant obstacle to promoting the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." Many fine yarn workers have learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, improving their output and quality, but their wages have not increased accordingly. This is because the wages of fine yarn workers in most textile factories are not calculated based on each worker's actual production volume but based on "Hanks." A "Hank" is an indicator that displays the length of yarn produced based on the machine's running speed; as long as the machine is running, it continuously indicates the length of yarn produced according to the machine's speed. However, because fine yarn machines constantly experience yarn breakage and empty spindles, the actual production volume does not equal the production volume calculated by the "Hank." The length of yarn indicated by the "Hank" is merely the length of yarn produced when there are no breaks and no empty spindles. After many workers learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, roller laps decreased, roving waste decreased, empty spindles were eliminated, and production efficiency improved, but this change is not reflected in the "Hank," so the workers' wages did not increase accordingly. In many factories, the wages of fine yarn workers are simply calculated based on their spindle tending ability, with no correlation between wage level and actual production volume, which is even more unreasonable. As a result, many fine yarn workers have lost interest in learning the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" or do not resolutely implement it even after learning it. Some people say, "It's the same whether you learn it or not; you don't earn any more money." The fine yarn workers at Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory said, "We are very happy to learn on normal days, but when it comes to getting paid, we get discouraged and don't want to continue learning."

The working class is the most advanced class; after in-depth political education, the production enthusiasm of many workers immediately increases. However, to constantly maintain and continuously improve the production enthusiasm of workers, it is necessary to combine political education with improving the material lives of workers. Relying solely on political mobilization, the production enthusiasm of workers cannot be sustained. It is perfectly reasonable to demand that those who work well and produce more should receive more compensation. We must resolutely implement the wage policy of "to each according to his work" and address the wage issues of fine yarn workers in a practical and reasonable way.

Based on the experience of some textile factories in Northeast China, to make the wages of fine yarn workers more reasonable, it is first necessary to establish a finished yarn weighing system, accurately calculate the cotton yarn produced by each machine and each worker, and directly calculate wages based on the weight of yarn produced. In this way, the wages of fine yarn workers can be reasonably increased along with the increase in production. Textile factories in various regions can study and adopt this method.

### 在推广“郝建秀工作法”中必须合理地解决工资问题

    在推广“郝建秀工作法”中必须合理地解决工资问题
    在推广“郝建秀工作法”的过程中，必须同时合理地解决细纱工人的工资问题。这是“郝建秀工作法”能不能深入推广和巩固的关键之一。
    目前，许多纺织厂的细纱工人的工资不合理，是推广“郝建秀工作法”的一个很大的阻碍。许多细纱工人学会了郝建秀工作法，提高了产量和质量，但是，她们的工资并没有随着提高。这是因为现在大部分纺织厂中细纱工人的工资，不是按照每个工人的实际生产量计算，而是根据“亨司”计算的。“亨司”是一个指示表，它是依据机械运转速度而显示出来的产纱长度的数字；只要机器不停，它总是随着机械运转的速度而不断地指出产纱长度。但是，因为细纱机不断发生断头及空锭，所以它的实际生产量，并不等于“亨司”上的计算生产量。“亨司”所表示出来的纱的长度，只是一个头也不断、一个锭也不空时的产纱长度。许多职工学会了郝建秀工作法后，皮辊花减少了，空粗纱减少了，空锭子消灭了，生产效率提高了，但在“亨司”上看不出这种变化，所以，工人的工资并没有随着提高。很多工厂细纱工人的工资，单纯依照看锭能力计算，工资多少和实际产量高低没有关系，这更是不合理的。许多细纱工人因此降低了学习“郝建秀工作法”的兴趣，或学会了也不坚决执行。有的人说：“学不学还不是一样，又不多挣钱。”青岛华新纱厂的细纱工人说：“平常日子学得挺高兴；一到开工资时，就灰心不想学下去了。”
    工人阶级是最先进的阶级；许多职工经过深入的政治教育，生产积极性立刻就提高了。但是，要经常保持和不断提高职工的生产积极性，必须把对职工进行政治教育和改善工人的物质生活结合起来。单凭政治鼓动工作，职工的生产热情是不能持久的。劳动得好，生产得多，就应该得到较多的报酬，这是十分合理的要求。我们必须坚决贯彻“按劳取酬”的工资政策，对细纱工的工资问题，加以切实合理的解决。
    依据东北某些纺织厂的经验看来，要使细纱工的工资趋向合理，首先必须建立成纱过磅制，准确地计算每台机器每个工人所生产的棉纱，按产纱重量直接计算工资。这样，细纱工的工资，便可随产量的提高而合理地增加。各地纺织厂可研究采用这个方法。
