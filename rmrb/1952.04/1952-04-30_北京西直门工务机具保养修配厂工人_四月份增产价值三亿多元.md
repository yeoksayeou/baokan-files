    Workers at the Beijing Xizhimen Engineering Tool Maintenance and Repair Factory
    Increase Production Value by Over 300 Million Yuan in April

    Comrade Editor: Workers at the Beijing Xizhimen Engineering Tool Maintenance and Repair Factory, in order to welcome the "May Day" holiday, under the leadership of railway labor model Peng Xingde, each team formulated a production competition plan at the beginning of April. As of now, most of this plan has been overfulfilled. The forging team completed its task seven days ahead of schedule, producing 390 various parts such as flatcar sets, saving a total of 1,752 work hours. In addition to completing the entire month's task three days ahead of schedule according to the original plan, the switch team also increased production of dozens of new replacement point rails, welded and repaired ten point rails, and welded and repaired three sets of frog, saving a total of 1,288 work hours. The fitter and machine assembly teams combined to make a dead machine come back to life as an air compressor, and the internal combustion engine team repaired an additional truck, saving a total of 272 work hours. Now, all teams in the factory have saved a total of 5,060 work hours, which is much more than originally planned. The value of the finished products made with these work hours is equivalent to more than 330 million yuan, which is the factory's gift to the "May Day" Labor Day. Zhao Rang, Wang Shaomin, et al.
