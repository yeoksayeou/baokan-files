Representatives of 120 mutual aid teams in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, report to Chairman Mao on the achievements of spring plowing production and increased production plans

Respected Chairman Mao: On March 9th, our county's People's Government and the Drought Prevention and Disaster Relief Committee convened a meeting of representatives of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives (including 120 people in total, including model laborers, technical experts, and experienced old farmers with drought resistance experience) to summarize the achievements of the previous stage of drought resistance and spring plowing preparation, and discussed the plan to achieve a 10% increase in production per mu (15 jin of unprocessed grain) for the entire county. We are now reporting to you the achievements that have already been made and the plans for preparatory work.

Our achievements so far are: (1) In order to preserve moisture and moisten the soil, we have mobilized male and female farmers to plow 3,250 mu of land, remove 62,000 jin of weeds and stubble, and harrow 6,590 mu of land. (2) One hundred and twenty mutual aid teams and ten agricultural production cooperatives have accumulated snow on 2,100 mu and ice on 500 mu, completing the plan for each household to moisten two mu of land. (3) One hundred and twenty mutual aid teams and ten agricultural production cooperatives have sent all manure to the fields. In order to make up for the lack of fertilizer, we are continuing to accumulate fertilizer. (4) Five mutual aid teams in Shuangfeng Village have repaired small irrigation canals for 350 mu of land, and the Guo Ermao mutual aid team has irrigated 50 mu of dryland wheat fields once. One hundred and twenty mutual aid teams and ten agricultural production cooperatives have a total of 89 reservoirs and 50 hillside water pools, which, together with the water from old wells and through-river wells, can ensure that 85% of the land can be sown without rain. In addition, seeds of drought-resistant crops and early-maturing and late-maturing crops have been prepared, so that in the event of a drought, each person can plant 1.5 mu of insurance land. (5) In order to ensure that the 130 revolutionary martyrs' and revolutionary servicemen's families in the county are not hindered in production, we have also stipulated that mutual aid teams adopt a contract system to accumulate ice and snow on three mu of land for each household, harrow the land once, build 26 reservoirs for 20 households, and build small-scale water conservancy projects to ensure that 90% of their land can be sown even in the event of drought.

Our丰产(豐産) plan for this year is: (1) One hundred and twenty mutual aid teams and ten production cooperatives will establish nurseries of 5% to 1 mu each, depending on the amount of land, to prepare for cooperative afforestation. (2) Before the Grain Rain in the lunar calendar, all the land for sowing will be plowed twice and harrowed three times, and three thousand mu of wheat fields will be weeded once, and efforts will be made to apply top dressing to more than half of them. (3) Build 580 mu of terraced fields and improve 3,500 mu of soil. We plan to plant all improved varieties. Currently, the selected seeds will be turned over and dried once. We have also ordered 400 jin of pesticides, 30 sprayers and 50 walking plows. We also plan to continue to purchase chemical fertilizers and insecticidal agents such as rosin oil and red alum.

We know that in order to complete this year's increase production task, we must lead the masses to improve farming techniques. To this end, in addition to strengthening the technical committee's guidance on mass techniques, we are also preparing to launch a competition for the promotion network of model labor's豐产(豐産) technology.

In order to concentrate manpower and material resources for agricultural production, we must also overcome the extravagance and waste in weddings, funerals and children's full moon celebrations. Wishing you good health!

The entire farmers of Yuanjia Township, Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, report on the achievements of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and丰产(豐産) plans

Respected Chairman Mao: We, the entire farmers of Yuanjia Township, District 1, Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, in response to the call for drought prevention and preparation for farming and patriotic丰产(豐産) movement, would like to submit to you our guarantee of丰产(豐産) this year.

Last winter and this spring, we voluntarily participated in the construction of water conservancy projects and have already achieved great results. We have built two reservoirs, five stone weirs, four earth weirs, six ponds, and opened 23 ditches, creating favorable conditions for flood and drought prevention. In addition to building small-scale water conservancy projects, we have also turned over all the late rice fields and planted 80% of the early rice fields. In order to implement this year's agricultural production policy of increasing yield per unit area, our fertilizer accumulation this year has increased by more than 25% compared to last year, so that each mu of field can be fertilized with 15 dan. These preparations have given us confidence in this year's harvest.

On March 1st, we held a meeting of township cadres, farmer representatives, Youth League members and production activists. We formulated a production plan, requiring the township to increase production by 26% this year compared to last year. In order to achieve this plan, we have also set out the following guarantees: 1. The township has 397 laborers, organized 35 seasonal mutual aid groups and 19 long-term mutual aid groups; 2. The township's early rice fields will be plowed four times, harrowed four times, and cultivated four times, and the late rice fields will be plowed twice, harrowed three times, and cultivated four times. The early rice fields for planting cotton and other cash crops will also be hoeed five to seven times; 3. Ensure timely sowing and timely harvesting. During the rice transplanting period, solve the problem of manpower shortage through mutual aid groups to ensure that all early rice fields are transplanted within five days; 4. Do a good job in代耕(代耕) for revolutionary martyrs' and revolutionary servicemen's families to ensure that they also achieve丰产(豐産); 5. Use the method of adjusting mutual aid to solve the difficulties of households lacking food, seeds, and tools, so that everyone can help solve problems if one family has difficulties; 6. No extravagance or waste during the New Year or holidays, and no purchase of superstitious items.
  　The entire farmers of Yuanjia Township, District 1, Chongren County, Jiangxi Province

    向毛主席保证作好防旱抗旱和春耕生产工作
    山西榆社县一百二十个互助组的代表向毛主席报告春耕生产的成绩和增产计划
    敬爱的毛主席：俺县人民政府和防旱、抗旱救灾委员会在三月九日召开了全县互助组代表和农业生产合作社代表会议（包括劳动模范、技术能手、有抗旱经验的老农共一百二十人），总结了前一段抗旱和准备春耕的成绩，讨论了实现全县每亩增产一成（十五斤原粮）的计划。我们现在把已经作出的成绩和准备工作的计划向你报告一下。
    我们已作出的成绩是：（一）为了保墒润土，已发动男女农民打圪垃三千二百五十亩，清除杂草、禾茬六万二千斤，耙耢地六千五百九十亩。（二）一百二十个互助组、十个农业生产合作社共积雪两千一百亩，积冰五百亩，完成每户湿润二亩地的计划。（三）一百二十个互助组、十个农业生产合作社已把粪肥全部送到地里。为了弥补肥料的不足，正在继续积肥。（四）双峰村五个互助组已修好浇地三百五十亩的小型水渠，郭二毛互助组已把五十亩旱地麦田浇了一遍。一百二十个互助组、十个农业生产合作社共有蓄水池八十九个、靠山掘水池五十个，连同旧井、透河井的水，可保证百分之八十五的土地在无雨的情况下播种。此外，还准备了抗旱作物和早熟、晚熟作物的种子，万一旱灾发生，每人可种一亩半保险地。（五）我们为了保证全县一百三十户革命烈士、革命军人家属在生产中不受困难，还规定互助组采用包干制的办法，给他们每户积冰雪三亩，普遍耙耢地一遍，给二十户打蓄水池二十六个，并增修小型水利，保证他们的土地在干旱的情况下，也有百分之九十能下种。
    我们今年的丰产计划是：（一）一百二十个互助组、十个生产合作社，各根据土地的多少，建立五分到一亩的苗圃，准备合作造林。（二）在农历谷雨前，把所有的种地耕两遍、耙耱三遍，把三千亩麦田普锄一遍，并争取半数以上施用追肥。（三）修梯田五百八十亩，改良土壤三千五百亩。我们计划全部种植优良品种。目前就把选下的种子翻晒一遍。我们还定购了防治虫害药剂四百斤，喷雾器三十架和步犁五十张。还准备继续购买化学肥料和柏树油、红矾等除虫药剂。
    我们知道要想完成今年的增产任务，必须带动群众，改良耕作技术。为此，我们除了加强技术委员会对群众技术的指导外，还准备开展劳动模范丰产技术推广网的竞赛。
    我们为了集中人力、物力，进行农业生产，还要克服在婚、丧和小孩满月等事情上的铺张浪费现象。敬祝健康！

    三月一日，我们举行了全乡干部、农民代表、青年团员和生产积极分子会议。制定了生产计划，要求全乡今年比去年增产百分之二十六。我们为了实现这个计划，还订出以下几项保证：一、全乡劳动力三百九十七人，组织季节性的互助小组三十五个，长期性的互助组十九个；二、全乡早田做到四犁、四耙、四耘，晚田做到二犁、三耙、四耘，种棉花等经济作物的早田并且要锄五次到七次；三、做到及时播种，及时收割。在插秧期间，通过互助组解决人力困难，保证五天内把全部早田栽完；四、做好革命烈士、革命军人家属的代耕工作，保证他们同样得到丰产；五、用调剂互助的方法解决缺粮、缺种籽和缺工具户的困难，做到一家有困难，大家来解决；六、不论过年过节，都不铺张浪费，不买迷信物品。
