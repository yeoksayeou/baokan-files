Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 4th: Twenty-one Chinese writers and artists engaged in literary creation on the Korean front, including Ba Jin, Gu Yuan, Song Zhi'di, Ge Luo, Bai Lang, Li Rui, Huang Guliu, Wang Xijian, Han Zi, Wang Xin, Luo Gongliu, Xin Mang, Xi Hong, Lu Fei, Yi Ming, Xi Ye, Gao Hong, Han Feng, Li Zhihua, Du Zhen, and Yang Shuo, jointly issued a letter of accusation to the people of the world on April 1st, protesting the barbaric crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in northern Korea and northeastern China.

The letter of accusation states: We, the Chinese writers on the Korean front, have personally witnessed the heinous crimes committed by the American imperialists on this land, crimes that violate human morality. We saw large numbers of flies, fleas, and mosquitoes carrying bacteria densely packed on the snow at minus seventeen degrees Celsius; we saw piles of dead fish and plague-infected dead rats dropped from American planes; we also saw various shapes of containers for spreading bacteria, which were dropped by American planes; we also saw many leaves carrying germs, chicken feathers wrapped in gauze, crows, sparrows, and pork carrying germs, as well as other strange things that are hard to name. These irrefutable facts prove one thing: the American imperialists not only want to eliminate the people living on this land, but they also want to kill the plants and livestock growing on this land.

The letter of accusation points out: Since January 28th of this year, when the American aggressors began dropping large numbers of insects and poisons carrying germs on Korean soil, the spokesmen of American imperialism have been trying to obliterate the facts with rhetoric, while intensifying their efforts to spread germs throughout Korea, and even dropping flies, mosquitoes, and fleas carrying germs on Chinese territory. These criminal facts cannot be denied by any sophistry.

The letter of accusation states: All peace-loving and kind people, if you do not want to return to the era when the Black Death was prevalent, you should put aside differences in thought, speech, religion, and skin color, unite closely, sanction the common enemy of all mankind, the war criminal who launched bacteriological warfare - the American aggressors, and cut off the evil bloody hands of the American aggressors. Everyone must clearly remember that American planes have always disregarded national borders on the map. The bacteriological weapons that the American aggressors are using to kill the people of Korea and China today will be used to kill the people of Europe and the world tomorrow. It is the common responsibility of the people of the world to shatter the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors.

The letter of accusation finally issued a call to writers and artists all over the world: You are the spokespersons of the people of the world. We ask you to immediately rise up and participate in this great struggle. We ask you to use all the weapons of literature and art to expose the crimes of American imperialism in launching bacteriological warfare. Let us unite together and fight to defend the civilization of the world and the happiness of mothers and children all over the world!

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, April 4th: Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning delegation and the Korean People's visiting delegation to China, who are currently visiting Andong City, visited the "Exhibition Hall of Crimes of American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare" on March 27th. The representatives expressed great anger at the shameless atrocities of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese people.

Jian Qun, a representative of the returning delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, recorded all the materials in the exhibition hall in detail during the visit. He said angrily: "When we visited various places in Liaodong, we had already personally seen the various crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare against the people of the motherland; now, everything we see in the exhibition hall is ironclad evidence of the American bacteriological war criminals. We have collected a lot of materials. After we return to the Korean front, we will tell the volunteer soldiers in detail, inspiring everyone to fight bravely and severely strike the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, and avenge the people of the motherland." Wang Fengchi, a tank driver and representative of the returning delegation of the Volunteer Army, pointed to the various poisonous insects and poisons in the exhibition hall and said: "There are so many kinds of poisonous insects and poisons. Obviously, the American devils are trying everything they can to kill the people of our motherland. After seeing these things, my heart is burning with anger. I can't wait to return to the front immediately, drive the tanks donated by the people of the motherland, and rush towards the enemy, beating them to a pulp."

Kim Jong-bong, a representative of the Korean People's visiting delegation to China, said after visiting the exhibition hall: "The American aggressors want to use bacteriological warfare to frighten the Korean and Chinese people. This is their dream. The Korean people who are fighting heroically and the great Chinese people are closely united, which is an invincible force. The final victory must belong to us." Kang Chung-seok, a model miner and representative of the Korean People's visiting delegation to China, said: "When the American aggressor army retreated from northern Korea in December 1950, they spread smallpox germs. That time, two of our miners were poisoned by them. Now, they are carrying out bacteriological warfare on a large scale, attempting to massacre more Korean and Chinese people. I call on the people of the world to take action and resolutely sanction the crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare!"

    在朝鲜前线的我国作家和艺术家
    联名控诉美国使用细菌武器
    志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民代表在安东参观“美帝国主义细菌战罪行陈列室”
     【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】在朝鲜前线进行文艺创作活动的二十一位中国文艺作家巴金、古元、宋之的、葛洛、白朗、李蕤、黄谷柳、王希坚、菡子、王莘、罗工柳、辛莽、西虹、逯斐、伊明、西野、高虹、寒风、李之华、杜震和杨朔，为反对美国侵略者在朝鲜北部及我国东北等地使用细菌武器的野蛮罪行，在四月一日联名发表给全世界人民的控诉书。
    控诉书中说：我们在朝鲜前线的中国作家，亲眼看见了美帝国主义者在这个国土上所进行的违反人类道德的滔天罪行。我们看见在零下十七度的雪地上密集着大批带细菌的苍蝇、跳蚤、蚊子；我们看见从美国飞机上投掷下来的成堆的死鱼和带鼠疫菌的死鼠；我们也看见了各种形状的散布细菌的容器，这些容器是被美机投掷下来的；我们还看见许多带病菌的树叶、包在纱布里的鸡毛、带病菌的乌鸦、麻雀、猪肉，以及其他不容易说出名字的奇怪的东西。这些真凭实据说明一个事实：美帝国主义者不仅想消灭生活在这个国土上的人民，他们还想要使生长在这个国土上的植物和牲畜一起死亡。
    控诉书指出：自从今年一月二十八日美国侵略者开始在朝鲜土地上投下大量的带有病菌的昆虫、毒物以来，美帝国主义的发言人一面用花言巧语企图抹煞事实；一面变本加厉地继续在朝鲜各处散布病菌，甚至把带病菌的苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤投到中国的领土上。这些罪恶事实是不容许任何狡赖的。
    控诉书说：一切爱好和平的善良的人们，倘若你们不愿意退回到远年黑死病流行的时代，你们就应该撇开思想、言语、宗教、肤色的差异，紧密地团结起来，制裁全人类的公敌、发动细菌战的战犯——美国侵略者，斩断美国侵略者的罪恶血手。每个人都要清楚地记住，美国飞机一向就轻视地图上的国境线的，今天美国侵略者用来杀害朝鲜和中国人民的细菌武器，明天就同样会被使用来杀害欧洲和全世界的人民，粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战是全世界人民的共同责任。
    控诉书最后向全世界的作家和艺术家发出号召说：你们是世界人民的代言人，我们要求你们立即起来参加这个伟大的斗争，要求你们用文学艺术的一切武器，揭露美帝国主义发动细菌战的罪行。让我们团结在一起，为保卫世界的文明，保卫全世界的母亲和孩子的幸福而奋斗！
    【新华社安东四日电】正在安东市访问的中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表们，三月二十七日参观了“美帝国主义细菌战罪行陈列室”。代表们对美国侵略者使用细菌武器屠杀中国人民的无耻暴行，表示了极大的愤怒。
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表简群在参观时，详细记录了陈列室中的所有材料。他愤怒地说：“我们在辽东各地进行访问时，已亲眼看到美帝国主义对祖国人民进行细菌战的种种罪行；现在在陈列室中所见到的一切，就是美国细菌战犯们的铁的罪证。我们已搜集了很多材料，我们回到朝鲜前线后，将详尽地告诉志愿军战士们，激励大家英勇作战，狠狠地打击朝鲜战场上的美国侵略者，为祖国人民报仇。”志愿军归国代表战车手王凤池指着陈列室中的各种毒虫、毒物说：“毒虫、毒物的种类这样多，显然是美国鬼子想尽一切方法来杀害咱们祖国的人民。我看了这些东西后，心中像火烧似的，恨不得立即回到前线，驾驶祖国人民捐献的战车，向敌人猛冲，打它个落花流水。”
    朝鲜人民访华代表团代表金祯凤在参观了陈列室以后说：“美国侵略者想用细菌战来吓倒朝、中人民，这是它的梦想。正在英勇战斗着的朝鲜人民和伟大的中国人民紧密地团结在一起，就是一支不可战胜的力量。最后胜利一定是属于我们的。”朝鲜人民访华代表团代表、模范矿工康仲锡说：“美国侵略军在一九五○年十二月自朝鲜北部溃退时就曾散布天花病菌，那一次，我们有两位矿工遭了它的毒害。现在，它们又大规模地进行细菌战，企图屠杀更多的朝、中人民，我呼吁全世界人民行动起来，坚决制裁美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行！”
