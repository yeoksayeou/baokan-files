Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st: The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, the largest republic in the Soviet Union, held a meeting from March 26th to 29th in the Moscow Kremlin. In addition to all the Supreme Soviet deputies, the meeting was attended by ministers of the Russian Federation government, members of foreign diplomatic missions, and Soviet and foreign journalists. Comrade Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and his close comrades-in-arms, other leaders of the Soviet government and the Party, attended the final meeting, receiving a storm of applause and cheers from all deputies and guests.

    The meeting first heard and approved the report of the Credentials Committee of the Supreme Soviet on the qualifications of the newly elected deputies from four electoral districts. Then, the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Ivan Fadeyev, delivered a report on the 1952 budget. He pointed out that the 1952 state budget prepared by the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation amounts to 54.748 billion rubles in revenue and 54.716 billion rubles in expenditure. As in previous years, income from the socialist economy is the main source of budget revenue. The main expenditures in the 1952 state budget are: 9.76 billion rubles allocated to the development of the national economy and 39.353 billion rubles for social and cultural facilities. This means that nearly 90 percent of the total budget funds are used to strengthen the republic's economy and meet the social and cultural needs of the people.

    The meeting then held a two-day discussion on Ivan Fadeyev's budget report. The more than thirty deputies who participated in the discussion unanimously supported the budget proposal put forward by the government and believed that this budget reflects the Soviet state's peaceful policy and demonstrates the further development of the national economy and the welfare of the working people of the Russian Federation. The budget amendment, unanimously approved by the meeting, totals 54.836 billion rubles in revenue and 54.716 billion rubles in expenditure.

    The meeting also approved the decrees issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation between the previous and current sessions of the Supreme Soviet, and elected the Supreme Court of the Republic. At this point, the meeting was declared closed.
