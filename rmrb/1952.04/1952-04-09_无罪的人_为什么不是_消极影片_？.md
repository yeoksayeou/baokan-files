    “Innocent People” Why is it Not a “Negative Film”?
    Zhong Dianfei

    The film "Innocent People," adapted from the original work of the famous 19th-century Russian playwright A.N. Ostrovsky, was originally scheduled to be released in Beijing in March. However, at that time, the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation mistakenly regarded it as a "negative film" and placed it in second-run theaters. When this plan was discovered by relevant authorities, it was immediately stopped, thus postponing the film's release date in Beijing.

    But the mistake was not thereby eliminated. When the film was screened in Shanghai, it was still treated as a "negative film" by the East China Branch of the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation and the Taxation Bureau of the East China Military and Political Committee. They refused the proposal of the Cultural Department of the East China Military and Political Committee to reduce the special consumption tax on the film, citing that the film had "no direct connection with current political tasks." It was not until after the screening that the mistake was discovered by the Party and government organizations in East China, and Zhao Qingxin, the deputy director of the District Taxation Bureau, was given a warning (within the Party) and a censure (outside the Party). [Note 1]

    Why did such similar mistakes occur in both Beijing and Shanghai in dealing with the film "Innocent People"? This is because today we still have a section of people whose understanding of politics is very narrow. In particular, they do not understand how to look at the events that happened yesterday or the day before yesterday in human society with a historical perspective. They even demand that the great Russian literary works of the 19th century have a "direct connection" with the Chinese society that is enthusiastically carrying out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements! Undoubtedly, this viewpoint itself directly violates Marxism-Leninism.

    We only need to recall Marx and Engels' admiration for Shakespeare and Balzac, Lenin's respect for Chernyshevsky and his contemporaries, Stalin's passionate love for Heine and Pushkin, and Comrade Mao Zedong's frequent mention of our great writers Shi Nai'an and Cao Xueqin to know how much these great proletarian teachers cherished the cultural heritage of all nations and how they regarded the works of these great writers as the jewels of human wisdom. Marxists have always believed that only the proletariat is the legitimate heir to these great legacies, and only the proletariat understands the true value of these cultural heritages. Because the ultimate mission of the proletariat is to build a society with a highly prosperous development in both economy and culture – a communist society.

    To understand the social value of Ostrovsky and his works, we only need to recall Lenin's famous essay in 1902 answering the question of "What Is To Be Done?" for Russian Social Democrats at that time. Lenin pointed out that the Russian workers' movement should absolutely not be limited to the daily tasks of economic struggle, but should strive to broaden its political vision and connect with the political struggles of all classes and strata of Russian society against the Tsar at that time, and lead them forward. He said: "When the workers have not learned to observe all the manifestations of other classes in present-day society in their intellectual, moral and political life, based on all the concrete and definitely urgent (current) political facts and events, when the workers have not learned to analyze and evaluate all aspects of the activities and lives of all classes, strata and groups from a materialistic viewpoint, the consciousness of the working masses cannot become true class consciousness." He also said: "If the worker wants to become a Social Democrat (author's note: referring to the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party of the 19th century), he must have a clear understanding of the economic nature and socio-political features of the landlords and priests, dignitaries and peasants, students and hooligans, he must know their strengths and weaknesses, he must understand the popular phrases and sophistry used by each class and each stratum to cover up their selfish intentions and true 'inner organs,' he must understand which systems and laws reflect and how they reflect the interests of which people. This 'clear understanding' cannot be learned from any book, but only from specific situations, only by exposing on the spot everything that is happening around us now, that everyone is talking about or talking about privately, that is expressed in certain events, certain figures, certain court rulings, etc. This all-round political exposure is a necessary and fundamental condition for cultivating the revolutionary activism of the masses." [Note 2] Lenin said that the pre-revolutionary Russian Social Democratic Party shouldered the great responsibility of "liberating the entire people from the oppression of the autocratic system," and also said: "Only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of advanced fighter. If the reader wants to know the meaning of this sentence a little more concretely, please recall the predecessors of the Russian Social Democrats, such as Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and that group of glorious revolutionaries in the 1870s; please think of the world significance that Russian works have now obtained." [Note 3]

    Ostrovsky was a writer of the same era as Chernyshevsky. His representative work, "The Storm," received high praise from Dobrolyubov, a close friend of Chernyshevsky and a great Russian critic. The Soviet people still deeply love Ostrovsky's works. Because his works sharply exposed the faces of Russian merchants, landlords, and nobles, and became a challenge to Tsarist Russia at that time, and became a powerful weapon to strike the Russian reactionary class spiritually and morally at that time. From the film "Innocent People," adapted from his later works, it can be seen that the heroine, Kruchinina, deeply hates this class spiritually because she personally understands the cold-blooded selfishness of the Russian aristocratic landlord class. When she returned to her hometown after wandering for seventeen years, she consciously realized that she was no longer the Liuba who was easily deceived by false emotions, but Kruchinina who understood life, was good at thinking, and dared to resist. When she came back from acting and saw the business card of the Morohoff she deeply hated for the first time, she told the servant: "At any time, I will never want to meet this Morohoff." But Morohoff shamelessly found her when she finished acting another time -

    Mor: It is an honor to meet you. I am – Morohoff. I went to the hotel where you live several times, but I never got to see you. I don't want to talk about the audience's admiration for your excellent acting on stage. You must have thought of this without me saying it, I want to clear up a special question of mine, you look very much like a woman - my former girlfriend. When I saw you, I simply couldn't believe my eyes, please forgive me, I can't help but ask you.
    Kru: Ask me.
    Mor: Are you Liuba Ivanovna Otradina?
    Kru: Yes. I am Liubov Otradina.
    Mor: Where did you come from, where have you been, and what is your life like...
    Kru: I don't think you need to know these things at all. Because this has nothing to do with you.
    Mor: What is your stage name? Why did you change your name when you came here?
    Kru: I changed my name to become an actress, this is very common, have you finished asking?
    Mor: Do you want to stop me from speaking and kick me out?
    Kru: No. I can wait for you to finish what you want to say.
    Mor: I am finished.
    Kru: Now I want to ask you. Where is my son?

    It turned out that they already had a son, because he was illegitimate, he was fostered in someone else's home. Morohoff abandoned them because he wanted to marry another wealthy woman. When Kruchinina left the area due to illness, he wrote to tell her that her son had died. For many years, Kruchinina also thought that her son was dead. But when she met the person who fostered her son, she knew that her son was still alive. And he was acting in the same theater as her. Of course, they didn't know this at the time.

    In order not to stain his reputation and status, Morohoff completely disregarded the life and death of his own son. This orphan without parents, like his mother, wandered around from childhood. People called him Neznamov (a person of unknown origin). In the theater, people felt ashamed to act with such a person. People made fun of him, and the governor wanted to expel him! Because this young man had been abused by society since childhood, his temperament became very solitary. When he knew that this new "big star" had pleaded for him in front of the governor, he dragged the clown actor Schmaga to seek revenge. He said to Kruchinina, who did not know that she was his mother: "My spirit has been so painful... When someone pities me or shows me mercy, it's like stabbing me with a knife! ... Don't waste your kindness so generously, be careful in the future! I understand that so-called 'being kind to people' is very moving, especially for a big star like you who is admired, but sometimes you will run into a wall and suffer unpleasantness."

    So far, we can already see: In a class society, some people, for selfish purposes, have created such deformed personalities in others! Some people, in order to seek their own happiness, have plunged others into the abyss of pain! We communists hate private ownership, hate all the evils caused by private ownership, and Kruchinina is indeed very close to us on this point. When this evil Morohoff stood in front of her for the second time, asking her to give a little "spark of emotion," asking her to "set conditions," and saying that he would "sacrifice everything to take back that happiness" and asking to repeat the old good times, Kruchinina said with absolute disgust: "I have already memorized these sentences!" And when she finally found her son, and her son asked her: "Mom, where is my father?" She looked at Morohoff standing nearby and then told her son: "Your father, your father is no longer worth looking for."

    May I ask: How can this be considered a "negative film"? From Morohoff's dialogue, aren't we hearing the "popular phrases and sophistry used by the Russian landlord and aristocratic class to cover up their selfish intentions and true 'inner organs'" that Lenin spoke of? From the governor sitting in the box and determined to expel the vagrant, don't we understand "which systems and laws reflect and how they reflect the interests of which people" that Lenin spoke of? From Kruchinina, Neznamov, and even Schmaga, don't we see the "drops and trickles" squeezed out of the social life of Tsarist Russia? Lenin wanted the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party members to "collect them... and gather them into a huge torrent," and then prepare to break through the dike of Tsarist Russia! Wasn't the October Revolution led by Lenin and Stalin such a huge torrent!

    Among these "drops and trickles," I want to especially mention the clown actor Schmaga. This is a person who wants to buy wine to drink after he has money, a person whom everyone disdains to associate with, but he is not a base and dirty person. Look at what he said to Kruchinina for the first time? He said: "You can be very kind to anyone, but never to us actors. Actors are - proud!" Regarding the description of such characters in Ostrovsky's works, the critic Dobrolyubov said very pertinently. He said: "Wherever you look, wherever you can see the awakening of personality, personality puts forward its own legitimate rights, protests against violence and tyranny. This protest is mostly timid, uncertain, and ready to hide, but in any case, it has made people aware of its existence." [Note 4] The clown Schmaga is a typical depiction of such a typical character. Indignation and dissatisfaction with Tsarist Russia have been fully demonstrated from such an "unimportant" character.

    At this point, we cannot but mention the outstanding directing and acting art that embodies Ostrovsky's brilliant democratic ideas on the screen. Because thanks to their genius and deep understanding of Ostrovsky, we can now appreciate this masterpiece from the screen in this way.

    It is obvious that the director Petrov showed a high degree of clarity and principled spirit in handling this work. The group belonging to the people and the group persecuting the people are clearly expressed in this play. If we start by hating the actress called Kulingina, but in the end, when she understands that the people she envies and despises all belong to the innocent, she also sheds tears of sympathy! And in the end, Morohoff withdrew from this historical stage as the only loser.

    The actress Tanasova, who plays Kruchinina, has won the Stalin Prize five times. For her outstanding acting skills, we can borrow a few words that Ostrovsky himself once said to express. He said: "In order to satisfy the audience, it must be done so that what appears in front of them is not the script, but life. It must be filled with fantasy, so that the audience forgets that they are in the theater. Therefore, the actors must understand how to perform life when they perform the script, that is, they must understand how to live on the stage. Just like in life, everyone can act on their own without thinking about how to pose, so it should be on the stage." [Note 5] In addition to fully achieving this point, Tanasova is also higher than ordinary "life," more refined, and more appropriately expresses Kruchinina's psychological description of Morohoff's thoroughly corrupt character - the representative of the aristocratic landlords of Tsarist Russia, filled with hatred and indignation. After hearing Morohoff's flowery talk, Kruchinina said: "This is really heartbreaking! You didn't value the enthusiasm of an ordinary innocent girl before, but now you are pursuing her like this just because she has become famous! But you should know that her heart is already cold." This kind of thought of the characters permeates her entire performance of Morohoff, we can feel it when she says such words and when she doesn't say such words.

    When Kruchinina saw the business card left by Morohoff for the first time, she had several close-up shots of memories, each shot only lasted a few seconds, but each shot was not static, like a relay point in a relay race, not a finish line. When she talked to Neznamov and Schmaga who broke in suddenly, she had many words that were originally meant for Neznamov, but she constantly took care of Schmaga sitting next to her with her eyes. Because she could fully understand that in such a world of gangsters, she herself had been injured spiritually, Neznamov was obviously injured, and Schmaga, who wanted to buy wine to drink after he had money, was naturally injured. The only difference was that she had calmed down and had firm thoughts, while the other two were still furious, and they only chose their current profession in order to make a living. Therefore, out of a kind of class sympathy, she tried her best to warm the souls of these people, as she said: "I have lived a few years longer in the world than you, I know that there are many kind people, many loving and sacrificing people, especially women. There are such people who do not care whether it is someone else's fault or their own, who are suffering. They are even prepared to help those who are degenerate and hopeless." And said that people like Neznamov who think they are "degenerate" and "hopeless" are "also lovely."

    In the stubborn, kind, and loving character embodied by Tanasova, there is a rebellion against all the old morals of Tsarist Russia!

### “无罪的人”为什么不是“消极影片”？

    “无罪的人”为什么不是“消极影片”？
    钟惦棐
    根据十九世纪俄罗斯著名剧作家阿·尼·奥斯特罗夫斯基的原作改编的电影“无罪的人”，在北京原定在三月间上映。可是当时中国影片经理公司却错误地把它当作“消极影片”，而列入二轮影院。当这计划被有关方面发觉后，立刻被制止了，这样便推延了这个影片在北京上映的日期。
    但错误并没有因此便消除。当这个影片在上海放映时，还是被中国影片经理公司的华东区公司和华东军政委员会的税务管理局当作“消极影片”处理了。他们以这个影片“与当前政治任务没有直接关联”为词，拒绝华东军政委员会文化部提出应对该片减征特种消费行为税的建议。及到上映之后，错误才被华东的党政组织所发现，给了该区税务管理局副局长赵清心以劝告（党内）和警告（党外）的处分。〔注一〕
    在对于处理“无罪的人”这个影片上，为什么北京和上海都发生这样同类性质的错误呢？这是因为今天我们还有着这样一部分人，他们对于政治的理解是十分狭隘的。特别是不懂得用历史的眼光去看人类社会中昨天或前天所发生的事情。他们竟要求十九世纪的俄罗斯伟大文艺作品，和正在热烈展开“三反”“五反”运动的中国社会发生“直接关联”！毫无疑问，这种观点的本身，便是直接违背马克思列宁主义的。
    我们只消回想一下马克思和恩格斯对于莎士比亚、巴尔札克等人的推崇，列宁对于契尔内舍夫斯基及其同辈作家的敬重，斯大林对于海涅、普式庚的热烈爱好，以及毛泽东同志经常提到我国伟大作家施耐庵、曹雪芹等人的情形便可知道，这些无产阶级的伟大导师们是如何珍视各民族的文化遗产，如何把这些伟大作家的作品看做是人类智慧的珠宝。马克思主义者从来就认定只有无产阶级才是这些伟大遗产的合法继承者，只有无产阶级才懂得这些文化遗产的真正价值。因为无产阶级的最终使命，便是要建设一个无论在经济上和文化上都有着高度繁荣发展的社会——共产主义社会。
    要理解奥斯特罗夫斯基及其作品的社会价值，我们只需要回忆一下列宁在一九○二年回答俄国社会民主党人在当时应该“做什么？”的著名论文便够了。列宁指出：俄国工人运动绝对不应该只限于日常的经济斗争任务，而应该努力扩大自己的政治眼光，和当时整个俄国社会各个阶级、阶层反对沙皇的政治斗争联系起来，并领导他们前进。他说：“当工人还没有根据各种具体而且确实迫切的（当前的）政治事实和事变来学会观察现社会中其他各个阶级在其思想道德和政治生活上的一切表现时，当工人还没有学会用唯物主义观点来分析估计所有各个阶级，各个阶层集团底活动和生活中所有各方面的表现时，工人群众底意识是不能成为真正阶级意识的。”又说：“工人要想成为社会民主党人（作者按：指十九世纪的俄国社会民主工党），就应当明确认识地主和牧师、显宦和农民、学生和流氓底经济本性及其社会政治面貌，就应当知道他们的强处和弱点，就应当理解每个阶级和每个阶层所用以掩饰其私利意向和真正‘内脏’的流行辞句与各种诡辩，就应当懂得哪些制度和法律是反映着并怎样反映着哪些人底利益。这种‘明确的认识’，无论从那一本书里也学不到，而只有具体情景，只有把现在我们周围发生，大家都谈到或私下谈到，表现于某些事变，某些数目字，某些法庭判辞等等的一切情形都就地立刻揭露出来，才能使人获得这种认识。这种各方面的政治揭露工作，便是培养群众革命积极性底必要条件和基本条件。”〔注二〕列宁说，革命前的俄国社会民主党担负着“把全体人民从专制制度压迫下解放出来”的重大责任，而且说：“只有受先进理论指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用。读者若想要稍微具体知道这句话底意思，就请读者回想回想俄国社会民主党底前辈，如盖尔村，柏林斯基，契尔内舍夫斯基以及七十年代的那一群光荣革命家；就请读者想一想俄国作品现在所获得的全世界的意义吧。”〔注三〕
    奥斯特罗夫斯基是和契尔内舍夫斯基同时代的作家。他的代表作“大雷雨”，曾经得到契尔内舍夫斯基的密友、俄国大批评家杜勃罗留波夫极高的评价。苏维埃人民对于奥斯特罗夫斯基的作品，至今极为爱好。因为他的作品尖刻地揭露了俄国的商人、地主、贵族的面貌，而成为当时对沙皇俄罗斯的挑战书，成为当时从精神上道德上打击俄国反动阶级的有力武器。从这个根据他晚年作品改编的电影“无罪的人”中可以看到，女主角克鲁契宁娜由于亲身领会了俄国贵族地主阶级的冷酷自私，使她从精神上深深地痛恶这个阶级。当她在外流浪了十七年重回故乡的时候，她自觉自己已经不是当年那个容易被虚假的感情所迷惑的柳芭，而是懂得生活、善于思想并勇于反抗的克鲁契宁娜了。当她演戏回来，第一次看见那个她所深恶痛绝的摩罗夫的名片时，她便告诉茶房说：“任何时候，这个摩罗夫我是永远不愿意接见的。”但是摩罗夫却厚颜无耻地在她另一次演戏完毕的时候找到她——
    摩：见到你很荣幸。我是——摩罗夫。我到你住的旅馆去了好几次，但总没能见到你。关于观众对你在舞台上的优秀演技的钦佩，我不想说。这不说你也想得到，我想打破我一个特别疑问，你和一个女人非常相像——我从前的女朋友。当我见到你的时候，我简直不相信我的眼睛，要请你原谅，我不能不来问你。
    克：你问吧。
    摩：你是柳芭·伊娃诺夫娜·奥特腊箕娜吗？
    克：对。我是柳芭夫·奥特腊箕娜。
    摩：你从那里来的，一向在什么地方，生活又……克：我认为你是一点儿不需要知道这些事。因为这对你是毫无关系。
    摩：你的名字是怎么取的？为什么你到这儿来要改名换姓呢？
    克：我改名换姓是为了做演员，这是很平常的事，你的话都问完了没有？
    摩：你想要禁止我说下去，把我撵出去吗？
    克：不。我可以等你把要说的说完。
    摩：我完了。
    克：现在我要问你了。我的儿子在那儿？
    原来他们已经有了一个儿子，因为是私生子，便寄养在别人家里。摩罗夫为了要和另一个有钱的女人结婚，便抛弃了他们母子。当克鲁契宁娜因病离开当地后，他写信告诉她说，儿子已经死了。许多年来，克鲁契宁娜也以为她的儿子是死了。但当她遇到寄养儿子的那个人时，却知道儿子还活在人间。而且正和她在同一个剧院里演戏。这一点，他们当时自然都不知道。
    摩罗夫为了不致沾辱自己的名誉和地位，完全不顾自己儿子的死活。这位没有父母的孤儿从小就和他的母亲一样，在外流浪着。人们叫他聂兹那莫夫（不明来历的人）。在剧院里，人们感到以和这样的人在一起演戏为耻。人们拿他开心，省长要驱逐他出境！这位年轻人由于从小就遭受到社会的虐待，性情变得十分孤僻。当他知道这位新来的“大明星”在省长面前为他求过情，他便拖着丑角演员施玛迦去寻求报复。他对这位不知道是他母亲的克鲁契宁娜说：“我的精神曾痛苦到这样……当有人可怜我，或是对我发慈悲的时候，那就像用刀扎我一样！……你不要这样慷慨地浪费你的仁慈吧，以后小心点！我明白所谓‘与人为善’很动人，尤其像你这样受人崇拜的大明星，可有时候也会碰壁遭受不愉快的。”
    就到这里，我们已经可以看出：在阶级社会中，一些人为了自私的目的，把另一些人造成了如何畸形的性格！一些人为了寻求自己的幸福，把另一些人如何抛进了痛苦的深渊！我们共产党人痛恨私有，痛恨由于私有所造成的种种罪恶，而克鲁契宁娜在这一点上，确是很接近我们的。当这位作恶多端的摩罗夫第二次站在她面前，要求她施舍一点“感情的火花”，要她“提条件”，并说什么“不惜牺牲一切，要把那幸福给夺回来”要求重复旧好的时候，克鲁契宁娜含着绝对厌恶的心情说：“这些句子我早就背得出来了！”而且当最后她已经找到了自己的儿子，儿子问她：“妈妈，我父亲呢？”她望了一下站在近旁的摩罗夫然后告诉儿子说：“你父亲，你的父亲早已不值得去找他了。”
    请问：这怎么能算是“消极影片”呢？从摩罗夫的对话中，我们不正是听见了像列宁所说的俄国地主、贵族阶级“所用以掩饰其私利意向和真正‘内脏’的流行辞句与各种诡辩”么？从坐在包厢里立意要驱逐流浪儿的省长，我们不是懂得了像列宁所说的“哪些制度和法律是反映着并怎样反映着哪些人底利益”么？从克鲁契宁娜、聂兹那莫夫甚至施玛迦等人身上，我们不是看见了从沙皇俄罗斯社会生活所压榨出来的“水滴和细流”么？列宁要俄国社会民主工党人把它们“搜集起来……汇成一条巨流”，然后准备去冲决沙皇俄罗斯的堤栏！列宁、斯大林领导的十月革命，难道不就是这样一条巨流么！
    在这些“水滴和细流”之中，我想要特别提一下丑角演员施玛迦这个人物。这是一个有了钱便要买酒喝掉的人，是一个众人都不屑与他为伍的人，但他却并不是一个卑污龌龊的人。你看他第一次对克鲁契宁娜说些什么呢？他说：“你对什么人都可以大慈大悲，就是千万不要对我们演员这样。演员是——骄傲的！”关于在奥斯特罗夫斯基作品中这样人物的描写，批评家杜勃罗留波夫说得很中肯。他说：“无论你往那里看，无论在那里你都可以看到人格的觉醒，人格提出自己的合法权利，抗议强暴与横暴。这抗议大部分还是胆怯的，不确定的，准备躲藏的，但无论如何已经使人发觉它的存在了。”〔注四〕丑角施玛迦，正是这样典型人物的典型描写。对沙皇俄罗斯的愤懑和不满，已经从这样一个“不关重要”的人物中充分显示出来了。
    至此，我们还不能不提到把奥斯特罗夫斯基的这一光辉的民主主义思想在银幕上体现出来的卓越导演和演员艺术。因为靠着他们的天才和对于奥斯特罗夫斯基的深刻理解，我们今天才有可能从银幕上这样来欣赏这个名著。
    可以显见，导演彼特罗夫在处理这个作品的时候，表现了高度的明确性和原则精神。属于人民的集团和迫害人民的集团，在这个戏里表现得清清楚楚。如果我们开始讨厌那个叫做柯陵基娜的女演员，但最后当她明白她所嫉妒和鄙视的人原来都属于无罪时，她也落下了同情的眼泪！而最后，是摩罗夫作为唯一的失败者而退出了这个历史舞台。
    饰克鲁契宁娜的演员塔娜索娃，曾经五次获得斯大林奖金。对于她卓越的演技，我们可以借用奥斯特罗夫斯基本人曾说过的几句话来表达。他说：“为了使观众满意，必须做到在他们面前出现的不是剧本，而是生活。必须做到充满幻想，使观众忘记他们是置身于剧场中。因此必须使演员表演剧本时懂得表演生活，就是说，必须使他们懂得在舞台上生活。正像在生活中，人人都能自己行动而一点点也不会想到怎样摆姿势，舞台上也应该如此。”〔注五〕塔娜索娃除了充分地作到了这点，再就是他比普通的“生活”更高，更洗炼，更恰当地表达了克鲁契宁娜对于摩罗夫这种腐朽透顶的人物——沙皇俄国贵族地主的代表，充满了憎恶和愤恨的心理描写。当听到摩罗夫天花乱坠地讲了一通之后，克鲁契宁娜说：“这真叫人痛心！从前你不重视一个平凡的天真少女的热情，现在你又这样追求她，只是因为她已成名了！但是你要知道，她的心早冷了。”剧中人物的这种思想，渗透到她对摩罗夫的全部的表演中，在她讲这样话和不讲这样话的时候，我们都可以感觉出来。
    当克鲁契宁娜第一次见到摩罗夫留下的名片的时候，她有几个回忆的特写镜头，每一个镜头都只有几秒钟的时间，但每一个镜头都不是静止的，好像接力赛跑中的接力点，而不是终点。当她对突然闯进来的聂兹那莫夫和施玛迦谈话时，她有许多话本来是专对聂兹那莫夫说的，但她不时用眼睛去照顾坐在旁边的施玛迦。因为她完全可以理解，在这样的江湖生活中，她自己在精神上受过伤，聂兹那莫夫也显然受了伤，而拿了钱便想买酒喝掉的施玛迦，自然也受了伤。不同的只是她已镇定下来，而且有了坚定的思想，另两个人则还是暴跳如雷，而且他们只是为了可以混饭吃才选择了现在的职业的。故她出于一种阶级的同情心理，尽量地去温暖这些人的灵魂，像她所说的：“我在人世间比你多活几年，我知道，在人们中间有许多善良的，许多慈爱、肯牺牲的，尤其是女人。有这样的人，他们不计较是别人的错或是自己的错，在受着苦。他们甚至准备帮那些堕落、没有希望的人。”并且说，像聂兹那莫夫这样自以为“堕落”“没有希望”的人“也是可爱的”。
    在塔娜索娃所体现的这种倔强、善良、慈爱的性格中，蕴藏着对沙皇俄罗斯一切旧道德的反叛！
