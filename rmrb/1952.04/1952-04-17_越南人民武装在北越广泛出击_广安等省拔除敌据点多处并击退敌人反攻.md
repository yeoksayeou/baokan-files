Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 16th: According to Vietnam News Agency, since the end of the Hoa Binh Campaign, the Vietnamese people's guerrilla warfare has been continuously developing in the enemy-occupied areas. For more than a month until April 7th, the Vietnamese local People's Army, militia, and guerrillas in the enemy-occupied areas of North Vietnam continued to extensively attack enemy strongholds, smash enemy "mopping-up operations," and achieved many new victories.

    In Guang'an Province, from March 1st to 15th, the People's Army removed 22 enemy watchtowers and 3 strongholds; destroyed one enemy gunboat and two flat-bottomed boats, totaling 300 tons; seized 71 tons of ammunition and 82 tons of grain; and killed, wounded, and captured a total of 186 enemy soldiers.

    In Haiyang Province, from March 15th to 20th, the People's Army removed 12 enemy strongholds, killed 100 enemy soldiers, captured 26 enemy soldiers, and another 118 enemy soldiers were forced to surrender.

    In Xing'an Province, on March 18th, the People's Army removed 4 enemy strongholds in Fuju County, killed 7 enemy soldiers, and captured 84 enemy soldiers. From March 24th to April 1st, the People's Army repelled several enemy "mopping-up operations," destroying a total of 4 enemy armored vehicles and annihilating about one enemy battalion. In early April, the People's Army ambushed an enemy force carrying out "mopping-up operations" in Kuaizhou, killing 212 enemy officers and soldiers and forcing the enemy to withdraw from Kuaizhou on the night of the 4th. On April 7th, the People's Army attacked the enemy-occupied Xing'an provincial capital and completely annihilated the puppet army's security team.

    In Henan Province, the local People's Army, militia, and guerrillas ambushed several large-scale enemy "mopping-up operations" in Meiren County and Pinglu County. From March 10th to 15th, the People's Army annihilated 500 enemy soldiers; from the 16th to the 23rd, the People's Army and militia annihilated 4 enemy platoons, captured 50 enemy soldiers in Pinglu County, annihilated 2 enemy platoons on Highway 21 (Henan-Shanxi), destroyed 7 enemy vehicles in Meiren County, and drove the enemy out of 2 strongholds.

    In Taiping Province, the enemy forces that had fled in panic from Meiren and Pinglu launched "mopping-up operations" in eastern Taiping Province, with more than 20 infantry battalions participating in the battle, supported by tanks, armored units, artillery, air force, and navy. However, on March 26th and 27th, as soon as the enemy's "mopping-up operation" began, the local People's Army units, militia, and guerrillas ambushed the enemy on several transportation lines and in villages. After three battles, 260 enemy soldiers were annihilated, most of whom were European and African mercenaries. On March 29th and 30th, a small portion of the local People's Army units encountered 3 enemy battalions and, after a day of fighting, annihilated more than 300 enemy soldiers. On April 1st, the People's Army operating on the banks of the Chali River annihilated another 35 enemy soldiers and captured 20. On the 2nd, the People's Army units defeated an enemy assault company, capturing 80 and killing many. The main force of the People's Army also circled around to the enemy's rear and launched a powerful attack, annihilating more than 300 enemy soldiers in one battle and liberating more than 1,000 young people and 30,000 civilians, all of whom had been captured by the enemy during previous mopping-up operations. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy began to withdraw on April 4th.

    In Beining Province, the local People's Army units removed the enemy's important stronghold of Leshou in southern Beining Province on the night of April 5th, shaking the entire enemy stronghold network in this area and forcing the enemy stationed in Anlu, 3 kilometers away from Leshou, to flee in panic, leaving behind a large number of documents, weapons, and equipment. On the 7th, enemy reinforcements supported by motorized vehicles and artillery attempted to reoccupy the Anlu stronghold, but were ambushed by the People's Army, resulting in the destruction of 4 enemy tanks and the killing of many enemy soldiers.

    In Nand 定 Province, on April 7th, the local People's Army annihilated more than half of an enemy inland river transport team including 12 gunboats and 82 small steamers, and seized many weapons and military supplies.
