How to Be a Good Leader

The Soviet Literature Gazette published an article by Comrade Zhukov, Secretary of the Voronezh Oblast Party Committee of the Soviet Union, on March 27, discussing how to be a good leader. Excerpts are as follows:

The consolidated unity of the Soviet people has established a brand-new relationship between leaders and ordinary workers in our country. For the first time in human history, leaders and ordinary workers in a socialist country are no longer opposing forces with conflicting interests, as in bourgeois society, but members and comrades of the same production team who consciously move towards the same goal. Communist ethics place high demands on all leaders, their working methods, and their connection with the masses. A high degree of ideological awareness and adherence to principles, sincerity and humility in demeanor, simplicity and sensitivity in dealing with people, intolerance for noise and empty talk, and the ability to promote criticism and self-criticism – these are the main qualities of a Soviet leader.

The interests of the communist cause are fully consistent with our morality. The interests of this cause require leaders not to be "aloof" and disregard all personnel, but to jointly decide all the most important production, economic, and other work issues with the entire team. This does not mean that the leader should convene a general meeting every time he issues an order (such a leader would be unprincipled, lacking in will, and completely useless), but that the leader should not confine himself to the office and not regard the affairs of the factory or institution as his own business alone. He should be good at explaining to his subordinates the complexity of the tasks that need to be completed together, pointing out the broad prospects of tomorrow to all personnel, and leading them to engage in selfless work. Otherwise, the leader will fall into isolation, and as everyone knows, this kind of isolated, small-scale handicraft leadership can accomplish nothing.

When explaining the basis of the relationship between the Bolshevik Party and the working masses, Lenin used the term "mutual trust" to express it. A leader should be good at trusting his subordinates.

However, not all leaders can grasp this truth. For example, Comrade Proskurin, the leader of the Lenin Factory in Voronezh Oblast, underestimated the capabilities of all the personnel in his factory. This factory director felt that only he himself had the required level, so he thought it unnecessary to consult the opinions of the team. This view is naturally groundless. In fact, this factory has had and still has some talented and highly capable workers, engineers, and technicians. The factory director's distrust made them feel insulted. The experience of some of the better Stakhanovite workers in the factory was frozen, and many workers lost interest in innovation and rationalization. The emotions of dissatisfaction between the factory director and his subordinates increased day by day.

The indignation of all the personnel in the factory is reasonable; it is more justified than the complaints of that clumsy leader. This leader did not realize that it was precisely because of his distrust of others that he blocked all initiative and the path to all new technical ideas.

But being good at trusting others is not enough for a leader. The leader's exemplary behavior in observing order, strictly adhering to discipline, and demonstrating selflessness in work is equally important. In order to avoid supplementing the lack of moral prestige with "positional" prestige, leaders must understand that strict demands should start with themselves.

Our leaders have great power to reward excellent workers in the team and punish those who fail in their duties. Every leader should realize that when he makes rewards and punishments, he is carrying out not an individual act but an act of social will, and that every reward and punishment will only have educational power with the support of public opinion.

In addition, the great significance of leaders' concern for the living needs and cultural requirements of the working people should not be forgotten.

Comrade Stalin has in the past and continues to require leaders to give the greatest care to the working people. Comrade Stalin taught leaders not to regard their subordinates as tools that obey the orders of their superiors, but to regard them as comrades in struggle who have the right to demand that their superiors care about everything (including their living requirements).

When a leader ignores Comrade Stalin's instructions, he will inevitably encounter difficulties. The reason is that at this time, ordinary workers are fully justified in regarding him as a cold person who treats them with a masterly arrogance and will not respect or trust him.

When considering the moral face of a leader, individual Party committees often narrow the scope of understanding of communist ethics, believing that immoral behavior is mainly in the area of personal life, such as alcoholism and dishonesty to the family. At the same time, they regard a leader's violation of state discipline, bureaucracy, suppression of criticism, negligence in work, and other behaviors as merely violations of our legal standards. This one-sided understanding sometimes makes the actions of the Party committees one-sided.

### 怎样做一个好的领导者

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    怎样做一个好的领导者
    苏联文学报三月二十七日刊载了苏联沃龙涅什州的党委书记朱可夫论如何做一个好的领导者的文章，摘要如下：
    苏联人民的巩固团结，使我国的各个领导者和一般工作人员间建立了崭新的相互关系。在人类历史上，社会主义国家中的领导者和一般工作人员第一次不再像在资产阶级社会中那样，是彼此利益相反的对立的力量，而是自觉的走向同一目标的同一生产团体的成员和同志。
    苏联人首先把自己的领导同志看做是在工作方面的上级同志，是为党所信托并能领导团体前进获取最大成就的上级同志。共产主义的道德标准向一切领导者、他们的工作方法以及他们与群众的联系提出了高度的要求。高度的思想性和原则性，举止的真诚和谦逊，在待人接物方面的质朴和敏锐，对喧嚣和空谈的不容忍，善于发扬批评和自我批评——这些就是苏联领导工作者的主要品质。
    共产主义的事业的利益完全与我们的道德相一致，这个事业的利益要求领导者不要“高高在上”地不管全体人员，而是要与整个团体来共同决定一切最重要的生产、经济和其他工作问题。这自然不是说领导者在每颁布一次命令时便应当召集一次全体会议（这样的领导人将是无原则的、缺乏意志的、完全无用的领导者），而是说，领导人不应把自己封闭在办公室中，不应把工厂、机关的事看做仅是自己的事。他应当善于向部属解释那需要他们共同完成的任务的复杂性，为全体人员指出明天的广阔远景，并带动他们从事忘我的工作。否则，领导者便会陷入孤立状态，而大家都知道、这种孤独的小手工业式的领导者，是什么也完不成的。
    在说明布尔什维克党和劳动群众的相互关系的基础时，列宁曾用“互相信任”一辞来表达。一个领导者应当善于信任他自己的部属。
    然而并不是所有的领导者都能掌握这一真理。例如沃龙涅什州列宁工厂的领导人普罗斯库林同志对本厂全体人员的能力估计不足。这位厂长觉得只有他自己一个人具有合乎要求的水平，因此他认为没有必要去征询团体的意见。这种看法自然是一点根据没有。事实上这个工厂过去和现在都有一些天才的和具有高度工作能力的工人、工程师和技师。厂长的不信任使他们觉得受了污辱。厂内一些较好的斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验被冻结，很多工人对革新和合理化都兴趣索然。厂长及其部属间彼此不满的情绪则一天天在增加。
    工厂全体人员的愤慨是合理的，它比那位笨拙的领导者的抱怨更为正当。这位领导者没有了解到，正是由于他不信任别人，才杜绝了一切的发起，堵塞了一切新鲜的技术思想的道路。
    但是仅是善于信任别人，对于一个领导人来说，还是不够的。领导者在工作中的遵守秩序、严守纪律和忘我精神的模范行为，也有着同等的重要性。为了避免用“职位”威信来补充道德威信的不足，领导者就必须了解，严格的要求，首先应从自己开始。
    我们的领导者有很大权利来奖励团体中的优良工作人员和惩罚失职的人员。每一个领导者应当意识到：当他进行奖励和惩罚时，他所完成的不是个人的、而是社会的意志的行为，他的每一个赏和罚，只有在公共意见的支持下，才能具有教育的力量。
    此外，领导人的关怀劳动人民生活需要和文化要求所具有的重大意义，也是不应当被忘怀的。
    斯大林同志过去和现在都要求领导者应给予劳动人民以最大的关切。斯大林同志教导领导者不要把自己的部属看做是服从首长命令的工具，而是要把他们看做是斗争中的同志，这些同志有权利要求上级对他们的一切（其中自然也包括他们的生活要求）予以关怀。
    当一个领导者忽视斯大林同志的这些指示时，他就必然会遭遇到困难。原因是，这时一般的工作人员完全有根据把他看做是一个以老爷式的傲慢态度来对待他们的冷酷人物，因而也不会尊重和信任他了。
    个别的党委会在考虑到一个领导者的道德面目时，时常缩小了共产主义道德的理解范围。认为无道德的行为主要是生活方面的，例如酗酒、对家庭不诚实等。同时把一个领导人破坏国家纪律、官僚主义、压制批评、工作中的疏忽和其他行为，却看做只是违反我国法律标准的行为。这种片面的理解，有时使党委会的行动带有片面性。
