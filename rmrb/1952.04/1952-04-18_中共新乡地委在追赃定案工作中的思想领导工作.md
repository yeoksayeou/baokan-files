    The ideological leadership work of the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee in the pursuit of赃 and case settlement work
    Zhang Junqing, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee

    The struggle for the pursuit of赃 and case settlement led by the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee has achieved a major victory. As of April 5th, nearly 40% of the贓款 (including origin and whereabouts) have been verified against the total amount of embezzlement. The struggle is now developing rapidly, and the level of awareness and fighting spirit of the masses have been greatly improved. The work of pursuing赃 and settling cases in a small number of units (Wuzhi, Yuanyang, and Yanjin counties) has been basically completed and is about to enter the stage of democratic construction.

    Based on the experience of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee, the following tasks must be done well in order to achieve victory in the struggle for pursuing赃 and settling cases.

    1.  It is necessary to resolutely oppose right-leaning thoughts, which is the main key to achieving victory in the struggle for pursuing贓 and settling cases. As the anti-corruption struggle entered the stage of pursuing贓 and settling cases, the right-leaning thoughts of some leading cadres and some of the masses have reared their heads again, seriously hindering the progress of the struggle. This right-leaning thinking is mainly manifested in: (1) Lack of the concept of striving for a thorough victory in the anti-corruption struggle. They mistakenly believe that since the corrupt elements have been arrested and the corrupt elements have confessed to the amount of corruption, this is considered to have completed the task, and they attempt to end the movement. (2) They express fear of the arduousness and complexity of the struggle, while others are negligent and paralyzed, and thus adopt a passive attitude towards the struggle for pursuing贓 and settling cases. (3) Lack of deep hatred for the crime of corruption, and insufficient care for the property of the motherland. As a result, some even sympathize with and pity the corrupt elements, and are confused by the doubts set up by the corrupt elements and the pitiful appearances they put on; more seriously, they mistakenly believe that engaging in the pursuit of贓 struggle will lead to "deviations," and thus hesitate and waver, slacken off, and lack positive and tenacious fighting spirit. The rise of this right-leaning thought fully reflects that some comrades lack the thoroughness and tenacity of the proletarian revolution, and shows the wavering and weakness of the petty bourgeoisie. If we do not resolutely overcome this weakness, it will be impossible to achieve a thorough victory in the anti-corruption struggle.

    In order to eliminate these obstacles on the road to progress, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee spent a relatively long time (generally five to seven days) conducting systematic ideological education and ideological struggle, rectifying the ranks, mobilizing the masses, opposing right-leaning thoughts, and promoting the thoroughness and tenacity of the proletarian revolution. The specific methods are: (1) Mobilizing the masses to specifically analyze the current situation of the struggle, affirm the victories that have been gained, point out the arduousness and complexity of the struggle, and at the same time analyze the favorable conditions for the struggle. (2) Leading personnel take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom, correcting erroneous ideas, and analyzing and criticizing them from the height of proletarian thought, in order to promote the revolutionary demands of the masses and oppose the idea and practice of abandoning the movement halfway. (3) Using concrete examples to conduct repeated and in-depth education in order to raise the consciousness of cadres, unify their thinking, and persevere in the struggle. At the same time, it also put forward the prevention of impetuous emotions and the occurrence of erroneous phenomena such as forced confessions and hard pursuit.

    2.  Strengthen the party's policy education, improve the policy thinking and tactical thinking level of party members and cadres, correctly grasp and apply the relevant documents promulgated by the Central Commission for Economy and Thrift Inspection, in order to facilitate the development of the movement. The new upsurge in the struggle for pursuing贓 and settling cases in the Xinxiang region was formed because of the correct implementation of the spirit of these two documents, but in the process of implementing the central policy, some obstacles were also encountered: some of the masses emphasized punishment and neglected transformation in the handling of corrupt elements. This part of the people has hatred and indignation towards the crime of corruption and the corrupt elements, and this emotion is valuable, which is the mass basis for strictly enforcing state laws and disciplines, eliminating the filth of the old society, and establishing a clean and simple atmosphere in the new society; but we still need to further guide them to understand the spirit of combining strictness and leniency, and combining transformation and punishment, as stipulated by the Central Committee, from the greater and longer-term interests of the people and the social conditions in which corruption occurs, and correct the one-sided views that the policy is "too lenient," etc. Another small number of people understand the central policy from the right side, unconditionally accommodate corrupt elements, are deceived by the cunning schemes of corrupt elements, do not pay attention to whether corrupt elements are truly determined to repent, and often hastily and easily give corrupt elements unprincipled lenient treatment, thus becoming detached from the masses. Some people, when implementing the central policy, do not specifically distinguish the different nature of the criminal behavior of corrupt elements and the specific ideological situation of corrupt elements to determine different treatment, but preach to corrupt elements in the same way, and thus cannot effectively smash the schemes of corrupt elements and correctly implement the policy.

    In order to strengthen the policy education of cadres and improve the policy thinking level and policy level of cadres, we have taken the following specific measures: (1) From leading cadres to every cadre, take enough time to study the relevant documents promulgated by the State Council, and combine the situation of the movement and the ideological situation of cadres to conduct analysis and research, in order to criticize erroneous ideas and deeply understand the spirit of the central policy. (2) Educate cadres to specifically understand and analyze the ideological situation of corrupt elements and their ideological changes, and deal with them separately according to different situations. (3) Organize well-prepared confession, accusation, and refund of赃处理conferences, and conduct policy education on a large scale using living people and living events, and use the effect of implementing the policy to educate cadres.

    3.  Emphasize conducting investigation and research, establish the viewpoint of valuing materials and evidence, advocate a realistic and pragmatic style, and implement checking accounts and verifying evidence. This is the central link in pursuing赃 and settling cases. On the basis of these tasks, organically combine the "firepower," "policy," and "materials" to achieve fairness and reasonableness, and have reasons and evidence. Pay attention to using examples of two typical contrasts to educate cadres to attach importance to investigation and research work, and overcome the tendency of some leading cadres and the masses to neglect investigation and research. In investigation and research, it is necessary to implement the mass line, overcome the purely technical viewpoint of some leading cadres who are detached from the masses and detached from politics, and prevent and correct the erroneous practices of simplicity, impetuosity, forced confessions, and hard pursuit in investigation and research work. In addition, advocate a detailed and concrete analysis method, check and verify in many ways, and overcome blindness, one-sidedness, and the tendency to make decisions rashly. Furthermore, use all available social forces to do a good job in the work of the families of corrupt elements and private businessmen. Facts have proved that a lot of materials and clues can be obtained from these tasks. Finally, pay attention to educating cadres to learn investigation and research methods, and constantly conduct inspection and summary.

    The struggle for pursuing赃 and settling cases must mobilize the masses in order to carry out the struggle thoroughly. The leadership should be good at guiding and raising the masses' own personal experience to the level of the party's policy to educate the masses, in order to raise the masses' awareness, unify the masses' understanding, and fully mobilize the masses. Only by adopting this mass line method can the party's ideological and political leadership play its due role.

### 中共新乡地委在追赃定案工作中的思想领导工作

    中共新乡地委在追赃定案工作中的思想领导工作
    中共新乡地委副书记　张俊卿
    中共新乡地委会领导的追赃定案的斗争，已经取得重大胜利。截至四月五日止，已对证的赃款（包括来路和下落）已近贪污总数的百分之四十。现在斗争正在迅速发展，群众的觉悟程度和斗争情绪大大提高。少数单位（武陟、原阳、延津三县）的追赃定案工作则已基本结束，即将转入民主建设阶段。
    根据新乡地委的经验，要取得追赃定案斗争的胜利，必须作好以下几项工作。
    一、必须坚决反对右倾思想，这是取得追赃定案斗争胜利的主要关键。在反贪污斗争进入追赃定案的阶段时，一部分领导干部和部分群众的右倾思想又有抬头，严重地障碍了斗争的前进。这种右倾思想主要表现在：（一）缺乏争取反贪污斗争彻底胜利的观念，他们错误地认为：既然已经把贪污分子搜捕出来，而且贪污分子又已供认了贪污数字，这就算是完成任务了，企图结束运动。（二）对于斗争的艰苦性、复杂性表示畏惧，有的则轻敌麻痹，因而对追赃定案斗争采取了消极的态度。（三）缺乏对贪污罪行的深刻仇恨，对祖国财产不够十分爱护，因而有的竟然同情和怜悯贪污分子，为贪污分子所设的疑局和所装的可怜相所迷惑；更严重的是错误地认为搞追赃斗争会出“偏向”，因而犹疑动摇，松劲厌倦，缺乏积极的顽强的斗争精神。这种右倾思想的抬头，充分反映了有些同志缺乏无产阶级革命的彻底性和顽强性，表现了小资产阶级的动摇性和软弱性。如不坚决克服这种弱点，要取得反贪污斗争的彻底胜利是不可能的。
    为了扫除这些前进道路上的障碍，新乡地委曾用较长时间（一般五天到七天）进行了系统的思想教育和思想斗争，整顿队伍，发动群众，反对右倾思想，发扬无产阶级革命的彻底性和顽强性。具体作法是：（一）发动群众具体分析当前斗争情况，肯定已得的胜利，指出斗争的艰苦性和复杂性，同时分析斗争的有利条件。（二）领导人员带头，自上而下地开展批评和自我批评，纠正错误思想，并提到无产阶级思想的高度来分析批判，以发扬群众的革命要求，反对使运动半途而废的思想和作法。（三）用具体的实例进行反复的深入的教育，借以提高干部觉悟，统一思想，把斗争坚持下去。与此同时，也提出防止急躁情绪以及硬逼硬追等等的错误现象的产生。
    二、加强党的政策教育，提高党员干部的政策思想和策略思想水平，正确地掌握和运用中央节约检查委员会所颁布的有关文件，以利运动的开展。新乡全区追赃定案斗争的新高潮就是因为正确地贯彻了这两个文件的精神而形成的，但是在执行中央政策的过程中，也曾遇到了一些障碍：有一部分群众对贪污分子的处理，强调惩治，忽视改造。这部分人对贪污罪行和贪污分子有仇恨和义愤，这种情绪是可贵的，这是严肃国家法纪，清除旧社会的污毒，树立新社会的廉洁朴素的风气的群众基础；但我们还须要进一步引导他们从人民的更大的更长远的利益上和发生贪污的社会条件上来理解中央所规定的严肃与宽大相结合，改造与惩治相结合的精神，纠正那些认为政策“太宽大”等等的片面性看法。另有少数人则从右的方面了解中央的政策，无原则地迁就贪污分子，为贪污分子的狡赖阴谋所蒙蔽，不注意贪污分子是否真正决心悔过，常常草率地轻易地给予贪污分子以无原则的宽大处理，因而脱离了群众。有部分人在执行中央政策时，不是具体地分别贪污分子犯罪行为的不同性质和贪污分子的具体思想状况，决定分别对待，而是千篇一律地向贪污分子说教，因而不能有效地粉碎贪污分子的阴谋，正确地贯彻执行政策。
    对加强干部的政策教育，提高干部的政策思想水平和政策水平，我们曾采取了如下的具体办法：（一）从领导干部起直到每一个干部，抽出足够的时间学习政务院颁布的有关文件，结合运动情况和干部的思想情况进行分析研究，以批判错误思想，深刻领会中央政策的精神。（二）教育干部具体地了解和分析贪污分子的思想状况及其思想变化，按照不同的情况，分别处理。（三）组织有准备的坦白检举退赃处理大会，大规模地用活人活事进行政策教育并以贯彻政策的效果来教育干部。
    三、强调进行调查研究，树立重材料重证据的观点，提倡实事求是的作风，实行查账对证。这是追赃定案的中心环节。在这些工作的基础上，把“火力”“政策”“材料”三者有机地结合起来，作到不纵不枉，有理有据。注意用两种典型对比的事例，教育干部重视调查研究工作，克服部分领导干部和群众中的忽视调查研究的倾向。在调查研究中，要贯彻群众路线，克服部分领导干部脱离群众、脱离政治的单纯技术观点，并防止和纠正调查研究工作中的简单急躁、硬逼硬追的错误作法。另外，提倡细致的具体的分析方法，多方查对，克服盲目性和片面性及轻率作出决定的偏向。再就是利用一切可以利用的社会力量，做好贪污分子的家属工作和私商工作，事实证明，从这些工作中是可以获得不少的材料和线索的。最后要注意教育干部学会调查研究的方法，不断地进行检查总结。
    追赃定案斗争必须发动群众才能把斗争进行彻底。领导方面要善于把群众自己的亲身经验引导和提高到党的政策水平上来教育群众，以便提高群众的觉悟，统一群众的认识，充分把群众发动起来。党的思想政治领导，也只有采用这种群众路线的方法才能发挥应有的作用。
