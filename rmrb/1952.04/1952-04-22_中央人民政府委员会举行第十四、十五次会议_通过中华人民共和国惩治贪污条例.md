The 14th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee listened to and approved the explanation of the draft "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Corruption" given by Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council (full text to be issued separately), and passed the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Corruption." After listening to the explanation given by Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, regarding the negotiation and signing of the Sino-Romanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the meeting approved the Sino-Romanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement. After listening to the report given by Liu Lantao, Minister of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, regarding the preparations for establishing the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, the meeting passed a resolution: approving the establishment of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, and abolishing the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government after the establishment of the committee.

The 15th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee listened to and approved the report on financial and economic issues given by Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council and Director of the Financial and Economic Committee. In his report, Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out that the large-scale "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements carried out nationwide have created favorable conditions for the country's economic construction and have achieved great results in financial savings. This year's financial situation not only continues to remain stable, but is also better than last year, and shortcomings in financial work are being actively improved. At present, the drought in agricultural production has been alleviated, and the central task is how to strive for spring plowing and prevent pests. With the development of national construction, China's industry and commerce are bound to prosper and will prosper in a relatively sound manner.

At the meeting, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Member Ma Yinchu, Member Xu Teli, Member Huang Yanpei, Member Zhang Bojun, Member He Xiangning, Member Zhang Nanxian and others successively spoke, unanimously praising the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the significant progress in the financial and economic situation. Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: In the past year or so, we have shouldered the huge task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and our financial and economic situation has still achieved such great achievements, which is the most exciting thing. Member Ma Yinchu said that the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and their huge educational significance can be clearly demonstrated by the smooth resolution of the adjustment of university departments. The promulgation of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption is a fatal blow to corruption, tax evasion and illegal speculation by unscrupulous industrialists and merchants. Member Xu Teli said that the government's policy of further improving the welfare of workers will definitely help increase the enthusiasm of workers in production. Member Huang Yanpei said that within two and a half years of the founding of the country, and while the war has not yet ended, prices in our country have not only been stable, but have also begun to decline. This good situation reflects the correctness of the policies of the People's Government, the efforts of government workers, the high level of patriotism among the people, and the people's support for the new country. The huge impact of this "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement on our country will be long-lasting. Member Zhang Bojun said that the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the significant achievements in the financial and economic situation prove the correctness of the People's Government's policies and Chairman Mao's leadership, and people from all walks of life should strive to implement the policies of the People's Government. Member He Xiangning said that the new atmosphere that has emerged after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has added infinite confidence to the country's prosperity and strength. We should also thank the revolutionary soldiers for their great achievements in defending the country and care about their lives. Member Zhang Nanxian said that the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements should be consolidated and implemented in daily work.

Finally, the meeting passed several appointment and removal cases.
