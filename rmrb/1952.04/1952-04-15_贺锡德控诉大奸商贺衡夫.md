    He Xide Accuses the Big Capitalist He Hengfu
    Comrade Editor: He Hengfu is my seventh-generation ancestor. He is a first-class criminal who steals national wealth, a traitor to the motherland, and an enemy of the people. I don't know too much about the specific crimes of his stealing state property. Now I want to expose his deception of the country and the people.
    In December 1950, when the government called on young students and workers to join military cadre schools, he pretended to be progressive, published speeches in newspapers, and broadcast on the radio. He said: "Now I have a grand-nephew, He Xide, who has joined the army. We must work hard in the rear, support the front, and increase production." But what did he do in the rear? He stole a large amount of national wealth, causing incalculable losses to the people. Coincidentally, his own grandson, He Xijian, also signed up to join the military cadre school at that time. When he came back from the radio station and heard the news, he did not encourage his grandson, but tried to stop him in every possible way, because it violated his personal interests. He Xijian's reply to him was very interesting: "Grandpa, if you publish a correction statement in the newspaper, stating that your speeches and articles are invalid, then I will not join the army." This was a crisp slap in the face to him. In 1951, another grandson of his, He Xigong, also joined the military cadre school, and he also tried to stop him. He Hengfu is so despicable and shameless, deceiving people with one face in public and another in private. In October 1951, when he came to Beijing to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, when I met him, he said to me: "I think it's a pity that you joined the army. You only have one year left to graduate from the economics department of the university. What can you do after graduation that is better than this! Try to leave the team, I can introduce you to a job, it must be better than this."
    However, I was not tempted by him. I said to him: "You have an old perspective. Joining the People's Army is the most glorious thing. I joined the army to serve the people, not to enjoy myself." I also gave him a crisp slap in the face.
    Now, I have regarded him as my enemy. I request the People's Government to severely punish him.

    贺锡德控诉大奸商贺衡夫
    编辑同志：贺衡夫是我的族七祖父。他是盗窃国家财富的一等罪犯、祖国的叛徒和人民的敌人。他盗窃国家财产的具体罪恶，我知道得不太多。现在我想揭发他对国家对人民的欺骗行为。
    一九五零年十二月，政府号召青年学生和工人参加军事干部学校时，他曾伪装进步，在报上发表言论，在广播电台广播。他说：“现在我已有一个侄孙子贺锡德参军了。我们一定在后方好好工作，支援前线，增加生产。”可是他在后方干了些什么呢？他大量盗窃国家财富，给人民造成了不可估计的损失。事情很巧，他自己的亲孙子—贺锡俭—在那时也报名参加了军事干部学校。当他从广播电台回来，听到这个消息时，他对他亲孙子并不是鼓励，却是百般制止，因为这触犯了他个人的利益。贺锡俭对他的回答很有意思：“爷爷，假若你在报上登上一个更正声明，说明你的演讲和文章作废的话，那我就不参军。”这是对他的一记清脆的耳光。一九五一年他的另一孙子贺锡恭又参加了军事干部学校，他也制止过。贺衡夫就是这样地卑鄙无耻，明一面、暗一面地骗人。一九五一年十月，他来北京参加人民政治协商会议，我和他见面时，他对我说：“我觉得你参军太可惜了。大学经济系还差一年毕业，毕业后干什么不比干这强！想法脱队罢，我可以给你介绍工作，一定比这好。”
    可是，我没有受他的诱惑。我对他说：“你这是旧眼光。参加人民军队是最光荣的，我参军是为人民服务来的，不是来享受的。”我也给了他一记清脆的耳光。
    现在，我已把他看作我的敌人。我要求人民政府严厉制裁他。　
    贺锡德
