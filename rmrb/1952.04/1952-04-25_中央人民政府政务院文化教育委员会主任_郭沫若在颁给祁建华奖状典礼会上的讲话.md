Comrades:

Comrade Qi Jianhua is a cultural instructor in a certain unit of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He created the "Rapid Literacy Method" in the process of teaching literacy to cadres and soldiers. This creation has made a great contribution to eliminating illiteracy and developing cultural education for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is an extremely valuable and important creation in cultural education! The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided to award Comrade Qi Jianhua a certificate of merit to commend Comrade Qi Jianhua for his contributions to the people's cultural and educational cause.

In the past, our country was subjected to the cruel oppression of imperialism and feudal forces for a long time, and the working people had very few opportunities to receive education, resulting in a culturally backward country with a large number of illiterate people. After liberation, the people became the masters of the new China, and their economic lives improved day by day. The masses' demand for learning culture has become more urgent, and many workers, peasants, and soldiers have reached a level of eagerness for learning culture. At the same time, our country's construction, after the restoration and preparation stage, a comprehensive construction undertaking is about to begin. If we do not pay attention to improving the cultural level of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the process of modernizing national defense and economic construction, the construction work cannot proceed smoothly. Seven years ago, Chairman Mao presciently taught us in "On Coalition Government": "Eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for building a new China." Therefore, at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic, Article 47 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated "implementing universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner" and "strengthening spare-time education for workers." In the past two years, we have done a lot of work in developing cultural education for workers and peasants and have achieved certain results. In 1951, the number of students enrolled in spare-time schools for workers was about 2 million, the number of students enrolled in spare-time schools for peasants was about 11 million, and the number of students enrolled in winter schools was about 35 million. The number of students enrolled in winter schools this year will increase further. As for the People's Liberation Army, since its establishment, it has established a fine tradition of attaching importance to cultural education and has continuously strived to improve the cultural level of cadres and soldiers. However, we are not satisfied with the achievements we have already made and must continue to work hard to make the Chinese nation one of the most culturally advanced nations in the world in the near future. We are planning to do this and believe that we will be able to do so.

For workers, peasants, and soldiers to learn culture, they must first learn to read, so that they can obtain the key to the cultural treasure house and further study scientific knowledge in production and combat. Because Chinese characters are relatively difficult to learn, it has hindered the work of eliminating illiteracy among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to a certain extent. This is a problem that has not been solved for a long time. The People's Government is already organizing forces to study the issue of writing reform. However, this arduous task cannot be completed in a short period of time, and the development of cultural education for workers, peasants, and soldiers is an urgent matter. The "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua has opened up a new path for literacy education for workers, peasants, and soldiers. The teaching process of the "Rapid Literacy Method" can be roughly divided into three steps: First, learn phonetic symbols and Pinyin, and master this auxiliary tool for literacy; second, focus on new characters, first seeking to be able to read and have a preliminary understanding; third, study language textbooks, expand reading, writing characters, and writing activities, consolidate the characters that have already been learned and seek further improvement. In the past year, remarkable results have been achieved in the trial implementation. In 1951, the Southwest Military Region successively established 87 experimental classes, which were tried out among 12,657 cadres and soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds, and good results were achieved. Generally, in only 15 days, all cadres and soldiers could recognize an average of more than 1,500 characters, be able to read the first, second, and third volumes of the primary school textbook, and each person wrote three short articles. Now the People's Liberation Army has widely promoted this method. Recently, trials have been conducted among workers and peasants in Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places, and the results have been very good. Tianjin held an experimental class on the rapid literacy method for textile workers. Twenty-nine workers who originally recognized an average of 520 characters improved to an average of 2,108 characters after 23 days and 195 hours of study, and were able to read ordinary books and newspapers and write simple articles. The results of the rapid literacy experimental class for peasants in Gaobeidian, Beijing, showed that 26 students, after 164 hours of study, generally recognized 1,638 new characters, about half of them recognized more than 2,000 characters, were able to read four volumes of peasant literacy textbooks and simple books and newspapers, and were able to write letters and speak in a preliminary manner. These facts prove that the "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua has not only achieved great results in educating cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, but also can be effectively promoted among workers and peasants. This method greatly reduces the difficulty for workers, peasants, and soldiers to learn to read, so that they can quickly and effectively obtain literacy tools in a short period of time, so as to improve their cultural level and better play their role in national defense construction and economic construction. Comrade Qi Jianhua's creation is a valuable contribution to the people's cultural education and to the entire national construction cause.

The reason why Comrade Qi Jianhua was able to make such an important creation is certainly not accidental. The cadres and soldiers of our People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have always possessed the spirit of not fearing any difficulties and a high degree of creativity. The military and political work of the People's Liberation Army implements the mass line. The reason why Comrade Qi Jianhua was able to create the "Rapid Literacy Method" is inseparable from the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army and the leadership of the Communist Party.

First, Comrade Qi Jianhua is able to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly and help the soldiers learn culture loyally and actively. Therefore, he was able to concentrate his energy, study his profession, and find this good teaching method.

Second, Comrade Qi Jianhua is able to go deep into the masses, closely integrate with the masses, deeply understand the lives of the masses, and therefore be able to find the laws of the masses learning to read, trust the fighting spirit of the masses to overcome difficulties, and be good at enlightening the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses.

Third, Comrade Qi Jianhua is able to get rid of the constraints of the old principles and principles of literacy education, abandon the outdated views on literacy education, proceed from reality, study the work situation, and seek his own path in a realistic manner. For example, Comrade Qi Jianhua has relentlessly criticized the old viewpoints with great authority, such as the "three-five concept" of learning only three or five characters a day, and the "four-meeting principle" of being able to read, speak, write, and use each character taught, and boldly created his own "Rapid Literacy Method." Therefore, Comrade Qi Jianhua is not a mediocre person who sticks to the rules, but a lively and creative revolutionary.

Comrade Qi Jianhua is a cultural instructor in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but Comrade Qi Jianhua is able to have extraordinary creations in very ordinary work. The success of Comrade Qi Jianhua's "Rapid Literacy Method" is a brilliant example of cultural educators constantly creating in their work in accordance with Chairman Mao's spirit of seeking truth from facts. Cultural educators should learn from Comrade Qi Jianhua's spirit and work selflessly for the development of the people's cultural and educational cause. Under the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the inventions and creations in the cultural and educational cause of the new China will be endless.

### 中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会主任  郭沫若在颁给祁建华奖状典礼会上的讲话

    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会主任
    郭沫若在颁给祁建华奖状典礼会上的讲话各位同志：
    祁建华同志是中国人民解放军西南军区某部的文化教员，他在教部队干部和战士学习文化的过程中创造了“速成识字法”。这种创造，对于扫除文盲、发展工农兵群众文化教育的贡献很大，是文化教育工作上极有价值的极应重视的创造之一！中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会决定给祁建华同志奖状，以奖励祁建华同志为人民文化教育事业所立下的功绩。
    我国过去长期处在帝国主义、封建势力的残酷压迫下，工农群众很少受教育的机会，以致成为一个文化落后、文盲众多的国家。解放以后，人民做了新中国的主人，经济生活一天比一天改善，群众学习文化的要求跟着迫切起来，许多工人、农民、战士对于学习文化，确已达到如饥如渴的程度。同时，我们国家的建设，经过恢复准备阶段以后，全面的建设事业即将开始，在进行现代化的国防建设、经济建设当中，如果不注意提高工、农、兵的文化水平，建设工作就不能顺利前进。七年以前，毛主席在“论联合政府”中就预见地教导我们说：“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建立新中国的必要条件。”所以开国之初，在人民政治协商会议共同纲领的第四十七条里就规定了“有计划有步骤地实行普及教育”，“加强劳动者的业余教育”。过去两年当中，我们在发展工农文化教育方面做了不少工作，取得了一定的成绩。一九五一年职工业余学校的入学人数约二百万人，农民业余学校的入学人数约一千一百万人，冬学的入学人数约三千五百万，今年冬学的入学人数还要增加。至于在人民解放军中，则自建军以来，便奠立了重视文化教育的优良传统，不断努力提高干部、战士的文化水平。但我们并不满足于已有的成就，必须继续努力，争取在不久将来使中华民族成为世界上有高度文化水平的民族之一。我们正计划做到这样，并相信一定能够做到这样。
    工农兵群众学习文化，首先要学会文字，才能取得文化宝库的钥匙，进一步学习生产和战斗方面的科学知识。由于我国文字学习起来较为困难，就在一定程度上阻碍了在广大工农兵中扫除文盲的工作，这是一个长期没能得到解决的问题。人民政府已经在组织力量研究文字改革问题。但这一艰巨任务，不是短时间内所能完成的，而发展工农兵群众的文化教育却是迫不及待的事情。祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”，为当前工农兵群众的识字教育开辟了一条新的道路。“速成识字法”的教学过程大致可以分为三个步骤：第一步，学会注音符号和拼音，掌握这种识字的辅助工具；第二步，突击生字，先求会读与初步会讲；第三步，学习语文课本，展开阅读、写字、写话活动，巩固已经认识的文字并求进一步的提高。一年以来，在试行当中收到显著的成效。一九五一年，西南军区先后开办了八十七个实验班，在一万二千六百五十七个工农出身的干部和战士中试行，收到良好的效果。一般只十五天时间，全体干部、战士平均识字一千五百以上，能读部队小学课本第一、二、三册，每人写短稿三篇。现在人民解放军已在广泛推行这种方法。最近在北京、天津、重庆等地的工人、农民当中试行，成绩也都很好。天津举办了纺织工人速成识字法实验班，二十九名原来平均识五百二十字的工人，经过二十三天，一百九十五小时的学习，提高到平均认识二千一百零八个字，能看普通书报和写简单的文章。北京高碑店农民速成识字实验班的结果表明，二十六名学员，经过一百六十四小时的学习，一般能认识一千六百三十八个生字，约半数人认识了二千多字，能读农民识字课本四册和浅近的书报，能初步写信写话。这些事实证明，祁建华同志所创造的“速成识字法”，不仅在教育人民解放军中的干部、战士上已有了巨大的成绩，而且在工人、农民中普遍推行也是可以有效的。这种方法大大减少了工农兵群众学习文字的困难，使他们能在短时间内迅速而有效地取得文字工具，以便提高文化水平，在国防建设、经济建设中更好地发挥自己的作用。祁建华同志的这一创造，对于人民文化教育、对于整个国家建设事业的贡献是可贵的。
    祁建华同志所以能够有这样重要的创造，当然不是偶然的事情。我们人民解放军的干部和战士，在中国共产党的领导之下，一向具有不怕任何困难和高度的创造精神。人民解放军的军事和政治工作，贯彻着群众路线。祁建华同志所以能够创造“速成识字法”，是与人民解放军的特点及共产党的领导不可分离的。
    第一、祁建华同志能够全心全意为工、农、兵服务，忠诚积极地帮助战士们学习文化。因而才能够集中心力，钻研业务，找寻到这种良好的教学法。
    第二、祁建华同志能够深入群众，和群众密切地结合在一起，深刻了解群众生活，因而能够找到群众学习文字的规律，信赖群众克服困难的战斗精神，善于启发群众的自觉性和积极性。
    第三、祁建华同志能够摆脱识字教育旧的原理原则的束缚，抛弃识字教育上的陈腐的见解，从实际出发，研究工作情况，实事求是地找寻自己的道路。例如：每天只学三五个字的“三五观念”，每教一个字就要会读、会讲、会写、会用的“四会原则”等很有权威的旧观点，祁建华同志都曾加以无情的批判，大胆地创造自己的“速成识字法”。因而祁建华同志就不是墨守成规的庸人，而是生动活泼富于创造性的革命者。
    祁建华同志是中国人民解放军的文化教员，但是祁建华同志在很平常的工作中却能有很不平常的创造。祁建华同志的“速成识字法”的成功，是文化教育工作者遵照毛主席实事求是的精神，在工作中不断创造的光辉典型。文化教育工作者应该学习祁建华同志这种精神，为发展人民文化教育事业而忘我地工作，在马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，新中国文化教育事业中的发明创造将是无穷的。
