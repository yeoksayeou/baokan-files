In Shenyang, Tianjin, Yangzhou, and other places, employees of some private enterprises, as the "Five-Anti" campaign was drawing to a close, drafted or revised patriotic pledges in order to consolidate the achievements of the "Five-Anti" struggle and unite with capitalists to conduct legitimate business. In the "Five-Anti" campaign, these private enterprise employees actively fought against the illegal activities of the capitalists, prompting them to confess their wrongdoings more thoroughly, thus gaining lenient treatment from the People's Government. Through this struggle, the workers' class consciousness was raised a step further, and they deeply realized that they were the masters of the country. Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they took the initiative to unite with the capitalists to develop legitimate business. Some factories and stores even held labor-capital consultation meetings or forums. The employees helped the capitalists recognize the great significance of the "Five-Anti" campaign and pointed out that industrialists and businessmen should follow the correct path stipulated by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which promoted the capitalists' enthusiasm for managing legitimate businesses. For example, the manager of Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji Silk and Cloth Shop in the first district of Tianjin said: "I am grateful to the government for its lenient treatment of me. From now on, I will turn over a new leaf and obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy." He also expressed his willingness to implement democratic management, improve business practices, and transfer more than 200 million yuan of off-the-books assets existing in Shanghai into the regular accounts to expand business.

On this basis, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade unions, the employees of these enterprises revised or formulated patriotic pledges as an action program to consolidate the achievements of the "Five-Anti" struggle and unite with the capitalists to conduct legitimate business. When revising or formulating the patriotic pledges, the employees conducted serious discussions and put forward improvement measures to address shortcomings in their work. For example, employees of Yangzhou Guohua Pharmacy proposed in the discussion that the bad, fake, and moldy medicines in the store should first be checked out and handed over to the Health Bureau for inspection and incineration, and they also proposed to quickly clear the accounts. Employees of Yangzhou Wuzhou Pharmacy suggested that invoices should be checked frequently during procurement and sales to prevent capitalists from evading taxes. After the patriotic pledges were established, the employees actively took action to strengthen their business. For example, employees of Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji Silk and Cloth Shop in Tianjin launched a business competition. In a short period of time after the employees of various New Pharmaceutical Industry stores in Yangzhou formulated patriotic pledges, the turnover of each store generally increased by two or three times compared with the past.

The patriotic pledges made by the employees of Shenyang Private Chengfa Iron Factory and Tianjin Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji Silk and Cloth Shop are now introduced as examples below:

Resolutely implement the spirit of the "Five-Anti" campaign, heighten vigilance, supervise the capitalists, and let them operate the factory legally; oppose the capitalists' illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, using substandard materials, stealing state property, and stealing national economic intelligence.

    沈阳等地某些私营企业职工在“五反”运动结束时订立的爱国公约
    沈阳、天津、扬州等地某些私营企业的职工，在“五反”运动行将结束的时候，为了巩固“五反”斗争的成果，团结资方经营正当的业务，都订立或修订了爱国公约。这些私营企业的职工，在“五反”运动中都积极和资方的违法行为进行了斗争，推动资方比较彻底地坦白了违法行为，因而获得了人民政府的宽大处理。经过这次斗争，职工们的阶级觉悟提高了一步，深切体会到自己是国家的主人。因此，在运动结束时，他们就主动地团结资方来发展正当的经营。有的厂店并举行了劳资协商会议或座谈会，职工们帮助资方认识“五反”运动的伟大意义，指出工商业者今后应遵循人民政协共同纲领所规定的正确轨道，推动了资方经营正当业务的积极性。如天津市一区谦祥益辰记绸布店经理说：“我感谢政府对我的宽大处理，今后要重新作人，服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导。”他并表示要实行民主管理，改善经营作风，同时把存在上海的账外资财二亿余元，全部纳入正账，以扩大经营。
    在这样的基础上，这些企业的职工都在共产党和工会的领导下，修订或订立了爱国公约，作为巩固“五反”斗争的成果、团结资方经营正当业务的行动纲领。在修订或订立爱国公约时，都经过了职工的认真讨论，针对工作中的缺点提出了改进办法。如扬州国华药房职工在讨论中提出，首先要把店中不好的、假的、霉的药品检查出来，交卫生局检验焚毁，并提出要赶快清理账目。扬州五洲药房的职工提出，今后进货、销货时要经常检查发票，防止资方偷税漏税。订立爱国公约之后，职工们就积极行动起来，加强业务。如天津市谦祥益辰记绸布店职工展开了业务竞赛。扬州市新药业各店职工，在订立爱国公约后一段很短的时间内，各店的营业流水额就普遍比以前增加了两三倍。
    现将沈阳市私营成发铁工厂职工和天津谦祥益辰记绸布庄职工所订爱国公约，举例介绍于下：

    二、响应增产节约号召，巩固分工负责制。每周召开技术研究会和生活会各一次，保证产品质量提高到百分之九十四，按期完成任务。
    三、响应抗美援朝总会的号召，作好拥军优属工作，帮助烈属军属解决困难，并且经常给志愿军写慰问信。
    四、团结友爱，遵守劳动纪律。工作时不离开岗位，保证出勤率达到百分之九十八以上。
    五、积极参加业余文化学习和政治学习，提高文化政治水平。
