    Pay Attention to Guiding Farmers to Plant Cotton at the Right Time
    To the Editor: According to a report from the Shahe County People's Government to the Xingtai Special Commissioner's Office on March 31st, a cotton planting craze has formed in the county since late March. According to incomplete statistics, the Third District alone has sown 20,000 mu. In Xizhao Village of this district, more than 1,000 mu were planted in the village alone. Many people said that the soil moisture is good this year, and they want to plant more cotton. Dayou Village in this district originally planned to plant 700 mu, but 900 mu were planted on the 29th alone, exceeding the original plan by 200 mu. I think this situation of blindly expanding cotton fields should be corrected.
    It is also inappropriate for the county to plant cotton too early this year. The cotton planting experience of the Xingtai Special District Farm and the farmers in our region has proved that it is not advisable to plant cotton too early. The experimental results of the Special District Farm show that it is best to sow around the Grain Rain solar term. At this time, cotton seedlings emerge quickly, grow normally, and are not prone to diseases. According to the survey results of the Special District Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Area in Nangong County last year, it was also proved that sowing is most suitable within ten days from two or three days before the Grain Rain to seven days before the Beginning of Summer. If sowing is too early, the seedlings will not emerge completely; if it is too late, there will be more flowers after the frost.
    We believe that there are two reasons for sowing too early:
    1. The leading cadres of Shahe County do not understand the role of timely sowing in ensuring high yields. They arranged for the entire county to complete cotton sowing from the Qingming Festival to April 14th. Therefore, farmers in Shahe started sowing on March 21st. The county leading organs did not seriously study what adverse effects early sowing would have on cotton production, and then led the farmers to sow, which will cause the bad consequences of cotton seedling deficiency and disease, affecting the cotton harvest.
    2. Lack of experience in preserving soil moisture. According to the current soil moisture situation in our area, as long as the land can be harrowed and rolled well, it can be guaranteed that cotton can be planted. However, the leading cadres did not educate the farmers in this way, thus causing the phenomenon of early cotton planting.
    We suggest: 1. The people's governments at all levels in Xingtai Special District and southern Hebei Province should earnestly lead the farmers to do a good job in preserving soil moisture and ensure that the sowing task is completed in a timely manner around the Grain Rain. 2. Judging from the situation in Dayou Village, Shahe, the farmers believe that the soil moisture is good this year and they want to plant more cotton. One village has exceeded the original plan by 200 mu. If the cotton planting plan is not controlled in various places, it will inevitably form a phenomenon of blindly expanding cotton fields, affecting grain production. Therefore, the people's governments in various places must educate the farmers and require them to plant strictly in accordance with the national allocation plan.

### 注意领导农民适时种棉

    注意领导农民适时种棉
    编辑同志：据沙河县人民政府三月三十一日向邢台专署报告，该县自三月下旬起，植棉已形成热潮。据不完全统计，只三区即已下种二万亩。这个区的西赵村，一村即种一千余亩，有许多群众说，今年墒好，要多种棉花。这个区的大油村原计划种七百亩，但二十九日一天即种了九百亩，超过原计划二百亩。我觉得这种盲目扩大棉田的情况应该纠正。
    该县今年种棉过早，也是不适当的。邢台专区农场及我区农民种棉经验，都证明种棉不宜太早。专区农场试验结果，认为在谷雨节前后播种最好。这时播种，棉花出苗快，生长正常，不易发生病害。又据去年专区棉产改进指导区在南宫县调查结果，也证明在谷雨前两三天到立夏前七天的十几天内，播种最为适宜。播种过早出苗不全，过晚则霜后花多。
    我们认为过早播种的原因有以下两点：
    一、沙河县领导干部不了解适时播种对于保证丰产的作用。他们曾布置全县从清明节开始到四月十四日，全部完成棉花播种工作，因此三月二十一日，沙河农民即已开始播种。县领导机关没有认真研究提早播种对棉花增产会有什么坏影响，就领导农民播种，这将造成棉花缺苗和发生病害的恶果，影响棉花丰收。
    二、缺乏保墒经验。根据我区目前墒情，只要能把地耙好耢好，是可以保证把棉花种上的。但领导干部没有这样教育农民，因此造成提早种棉的现象。
    我们建议：一、邢台专区及河北省南部地区的各级人民政府，应切实领导农民作好保墒工作，保证在谷雨前后适时完成播种任务。二、从沙河大油村情况来看，农民认为今年墒好，要多种棉花，一村即超过原计划二百亩。各地如对种棉计划不加控制，势将形成盲目扩大棉田的现象，影响粮食增产。因此，各地人民政府一定要教育农民，要求他们切实按照国家分配的计划进行种植。
