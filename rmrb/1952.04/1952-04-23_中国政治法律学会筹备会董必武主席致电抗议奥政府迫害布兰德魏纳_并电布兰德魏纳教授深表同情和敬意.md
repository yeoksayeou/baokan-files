Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd. In order to protest the Austrian government's persecution of Brandweiner, a member of the World Peace Council, by dismissing him from his professorship at the University of Graz, Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society, sent a telegram to the Minister of Education of the Austrian government on the 22nd, lodging a serious protest; and sent a telegram to Professor Brandweiner, expressing his respect. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

I. Telegram to the Minister of Education of the Austrian Government:

To the Minister of Education of the Austrian Government:

Your ministry has dismissed Professor Brandweiner from his professorship at the University of Graz because he investigated and exposed the inhumane crimes of the American aggressors, which seriously violate international law, in carrying out various atrocities in Korea and conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. Your government's actions, following the instructions of the American imperialists, persecuting peace fighters, and disregarding human safety, have aroused the immense anger of the Chinese and peace-loving people of all countries. I now, on behalf of the China Political Science and Law Society, lodge a serious protest. Your ministry must immediately correct this illegal act of persecution.

Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society

April 22, 1952, in Beijing

II. Telegram to Professor Brandweiner:

To Professor Brandweiner:

The Austrian government's Ministry of Education, following the instructions of the American imperialists, has dismissed you from your professorship at the University of Graz. This act of the Austrian government, persecuting peace fighters and disregarding human safety, has aroused the immense anger of the Chinese and peace-loving people of all countries. Your leadership of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team to investigate and expose the crimes of the American aggressors in systematically waging war of destruction in Korea and conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China has enabled the people of all countries to more clearly recognize the hideous face of the American imperialists and to redouble their efforts to denounce and stop them. This is a major contribution to safeguarding world peace and human safety. Any persecution carried out or directed by the American imperialists only serves to show their fear of having their crimes exposed and will not affect our active efforts to defend peace in the slightest. On the contrary, it has deepened our hatred for the American aggressors. We are convinced that the Chinese and peace-loving people all over the world stand with you and vow to fight to the end to safeguard human safety. On behalf of the China Political Science and Law Society, in addition to sending a serious protest to the Austrian government's Ministry of Education, I would like to express my deep sympathy and warm respect to you.

Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society

April 22, 1952, in Beijing

    中国政治法律学会筹备会董必武主席致电抗议奥政府迫害布兰德魏纳
    并电布兰德魏纳教授深表同情和敬意
    【新华社二十二日讯】为了抗议奥地利政府解除世界和平理事会理事布兰德魏纳在格拉茨大学的教授职务的迫害行为，中国政治法律学会筹备会董必武主席二十二日致电奥地利政府教育部部长，提出严重抗议；并致电布兰德魏纳教授，表示敬意。两电电文如下：
    一、致奥地利政府教育部部长电奥地利政府教育部部长：
    你部竟因布兰德魏纳教授调查并揭破了美国侵略者灭绝人性，严重违反国际公法，在朝鲜进行各种暴行及在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的罪恶行为，而解除了他在格拉茨大学的教授职务。你政府这种顺从美帝国主义者的指使，迫害和平战士，无视人类安全的行为，已经引起了中国和各国爱好和平人民的无比愤怒。我现代表中国政治法律学会提出严重抗议。你部必须把这种非法迫害的行为，立即纠正。
    中国政治法律学会筹备会主席董必武

    二、致布兰德魏纳教授电布兰德魏纳教授：
    奥地利政府教育部顺从美帝国主义者的指使，解除你在格拉茨大学的教授职务。奥地利政府这种迫害和平战士，无视人类安全的行为，已经引起中国和各国爱好和平人民的无比愤怒。你这次领导国际民主法律工作者协会调查团，调查并揭破了美国侵略者在朝鲜有计划地进行破坏战争法和在朝鲜及中国东北进行细菌战的罪行，已使各国人民更认清美帝国主义者的狰狞面目，再接再厉地予以声讨和制止，这是对于保卫世界和平与人类安全的一个重大贡献。美帝国主义者所进行或指使的任何迫害行为，只足以表示它对于罪行被人揭破的恐惧，决不能丝毫影响我们为保卫和平的积极努力，相反地，更加深了我们对于美国侵略者的愤恨。我们深信：中国和全世界爱好和平的人民都和你站在一起，誓为保障人类安全而斗争到底。我代表中国政治法律学会，除已电奥地利政府教育部提出严重抗议外，谨向你表示深切的同情和热烈的敬意。
    中国政治法律学会筹备会主席董必武
    一九五二年四月二十二日于北京
