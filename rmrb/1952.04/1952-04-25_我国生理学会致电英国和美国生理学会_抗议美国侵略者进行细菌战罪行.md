The Chinese Physiological Society Sends Telegram to British and American Physiological Societies
Protesting the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare Crimes

The Chinese Physiological Society has sent a telegram to the British and American Physiological Societies protesting the crimes of germ warfare committed by the American aggressors. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the British and American Physiological Societies:

We, the members of the Chinese Physiological Society, hereby express our scientific evidence and righteous condemnation regarding the American military aircraft's massive spreading of various poisonous insects and substances carrying bacteria in order to slaughter peaceful residents and the Korean and Chinese People's Army in Korea. This violates human justice and international law. We hope that you will stand on the position of physiological scientists and on the position of humanity, and join us in quickly stopping this crime of launching germ warfare.

Starting from January 28, 1952, American military aircraft continuously spread various poisonous insects carrying bacteria over the skies of Korea. From February 29 to March 5, American military aircraft invading Korea intruded into our Northeast airspace a total of 68 times, with 448 sorties, spreading large quantities of poisonous insects carrying bacteria in various locations in the Northeast. On March 6 and 7, the evil germ warfare spread to the vicinity of Qingdao in Shandong Province, China.

Our members and other experts in entomology, bacteriology, and other fields have personally obtained the remains of bacteriological bombs dropped by American aircraft in a certain area of the Northeast. Insects that could not possibly exist at the time and place were found near the recovered container fragments. After examination, these insects were proven to carry cholera, plague, typhoid, and other germs.

This crime of slaughtering humanity committed by the American aggressor troops is intolerable to peace-loving and just people all over the world! It is especially intolerable to physiological scientists who are engaged in research to eliminate human diseases and reduce human suffering! Therefore, we sincerely hope that you will call on all members to join us in condemning and stopping this insane crime.

There is no doubt that physiological scientists have a particularly important responsibility to stop the crime of germ warfare. This is because the work of physiological scientists is to eliminate the harm to humans caused by all toxic bacteria, viruses, and bacterial secretions. This is a sacred cause aimed at "benefiting mankind." However, in the imperialist countries of the United States and Britain, a few physiological scientists do not hesitate to sell out this sacred cause and willingly be used by warmongers to engage in research and manufacture bacteriological weapons for their aggressive wars. This is a great insult to the dignity of science and a great insult to human justice. We hope that physiological scientists all over the world will unite to safeguard the dignity of science, defend humanity, and defend peace!

    我国生理学会致电英国和美国生理学会
    抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国生理学会致电英、美生理学会，抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，电文如下：英美国生理学会：
    我们中国生理学会全体会员对于美国侵略朝鲜的军用飞机大量撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫毒物，违反人类正义和国际公法，进行以大规模屠杀朝中和平居民和朝中人民部队为目的的细菌战这一事，特向我们的同道提出科学的证据和正义的声讨；希望你们站在生理科学工作者的立场上，站在人道的立场上，和我们一起赶快制止这种发动细菌战的罪行。
    自一九五二年一月二十八日起始，美国的军用飞机连续在朝鲜上空撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫，自二月二十九日至三月五日，美国侵朝军用飞机更先后侵入我东北领空共六十八批，四百四十八架次，在东北各地撒布大量传播细菌的毒虫。三月六日及七日，罪恶的细菌战扩展到我国山东的青岛附近地区。
    我们的会员和其他昆虫学、细菌学等专家们已经亲身在东北某地获得了美国飞机投掷的细菌弹骸体。并在检获容器碎片附近发现当时当地绝不可能有的昆虫，这些昆虫经检验后，证明有霍乱、鼠疫、伤寒等病菌。
    美国侵略军这种屠杀人类的罪行，是全世界爱好和平与正义的人民所不能容忍的！尤其是为了消灭人类疾病和减少人类痛苦而从事研究的生理科学工作者所不能容忍的！因此，我们诚恳地希望你会号召全体会员和我们在一起共同谴责和制止这种疯狂罪行。
    毫无疑问，生理科学工作者对于制止细菌战罪行负有特别重大的责任。这是因为生理科学工作者所从事的事业，就是消灭一切有毒的细菌、病毒、细菌的分泌物对于人类的危害。这是一种以“造福人类”为目的的神圣的事业。可是，在美英帝国主义国家，却有少数生理科学工作者，不惜出卖这一神圣的事业，而甘受战争贩子的利用，为他们进行侵略战争而从事研究和制造细菌武器。这是对于科学的尊严的绝大污辱，也是对于人类正义的绝大侮辱。我们希望全世界生理科学工作者团结起来，维护科学的尊严，保卫人类，保卫和平！
    中国生理学会理事长赵以炳
    一九五二年四月二十二日
