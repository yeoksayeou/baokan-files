    The Man Who Lives Forever
    Xiao Qi
    In a certain village in northern Korea, one can often hear the villagers singing the praises of the immortal internationalist fighter—the First-Class People-Loving Model and Special-Class Meritorious Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Martyr Luo Shengjiao. The Korean people sing:
    "Green river, high mountain, Chinese hero lives for ten thousand years; We love Luo Shengjiao, endless songs of praise."
    During the Qingming Festival, over 300 people, including leaders of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, representatives of the local organizations of the Korean Workers' Party, the local Korean government, and the People's Army, as well as local Korean residents, went to Luo Shengjiao's cemetery to sweep the tomb. The tomb was piled with wreaths and hung with elegiac scrolls. Cui? and his parents presented the most solemn Korean sacrificial dishes and wine at the martyr's tomb. Before the Qingming Festival, local residents had already added new soil to the martyr's tomb, repaired the road leading to the cemetery, planted two rows of pine trees along the road, and planted many small pine trees around the tomb. In front of the tomb, they also built an arc-shaped tomb edge more than two meters high and five meters long, and built a small square of more than twenty square meters.
    Choi Tae-won, the secretary of the Labor Party village branch, often said to everyone: "In the past, the American robbers shot our relatives in front of the village, and the blood stained the river red; however, the Volunteer Army soldiers sacrificed themselves in this river to save our children. This disaster, this friendship, is most unforgettable. We must never forget who our enemies are and who our relatives are." One day, Cui?'s mother said to her neighbors with tears in her eyes: "Last night I dreamed that Comrade Luo was alive, wearing a hero's medal on his chest, emitting a shining golden light. He smiled and called me 'Amani', and I cried with joy! This lovely child, I will never forget him!"
    This spring, Cui? wrote a letter to Luo Shengjiao's parents in China, saying: "Comrade Luo sacrificed his life to save me. I will inherit Comrade Luo's will, join the People's Army, and fight the American aggressors together with the Volunteer Army comrades!" He then resolutely left his family and walked dozens of miles to find the People's Army, begging to join the army. The commanders and fighters of the People's Army had long been spreading the heroic deeds of Luo Shengjiao. They admired him and surrounded Cui? to ask about the martyr's voice and appearance. The officer of the People's Army considered Cui?'s request to join the army for a long time, but later, because he was not old enough to join the army, he encouraged him to go back and work hard in production, strive to support the front, and sign up again next year.
    Soon, the news of the Hunan Xinhua County people's memorial service for Martyr Luo Shengjiao spread to this village; Cui? also received a letter from Luo Shengjiao's father. All the people in the village automatically gathered, and the secretary of the Labor Party village branch reported at the meeting the situation of the memorial service for the martyr in Luo Shengjiao's hometown. Cui? excitedly read to everyone at the meeting the letter from Martyr Luo Shengjiao's father, which had been translated into Korean. The letter said: "Shengjiao has sacrificed, but you are still alive, and I will treat you like Shengjiao. ..." People were deeply moved by the great love of the martyr's father, Luo Diekai. Cui? continued to read with tears: "I am truly grateful to the Korean mother who took the place she had prepared for her own burial to bury Shengjiao, and to the Korean people who treated Shengjiao like a relative. I hope you will convey my gratitude to them."
    When Martyr Luo Shengjiao was buried, all the people in the village swore in front of the martyr's tomb: to guarantee to pay the public grain early, cultivate carefully, produce more grain, support the front, and resolutely fight the American aggressors. Now, the villagers are putting their vows into practice with concrete actions. At the meeting to discuss increasing production to support the front, they proposed that the village should increase public grain production by 10,000 jin, an increase of one-half over last year's public grain. When people raised their hands to pass this resolution, they shouted: "For Luo Shengjiao!" "For victory!" Cui? jumped onto the stage and said: "I was not able to join the army this year, I must become a labor hero on the production front!" On the spot, more than a dozen young people joined the "Luo Shengjiao Production Assault Team" he organized.
    In spring, the river thawed, and the mountains showed green. The sowing people were scattered on the mountains behind the village and the riverside in front of the village, working hard. This mountain is the remaining vein of Changbai Mountain, and this river is a tributary of the Daedong River. For many years, this mountain and river have had no names; now, people gloriously named it "Luo Shengjiao Mountain" and "Luo Shengjiao River" to forever commemorate this great internationalist fighter.

    永远活着的人
    萧琦
    在朝鲜北部的某村里，常常可以听见老乡们歌颂着不朽的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军的一级爱民模范，特等功臣罗盛教烈士。朝鲜人民唱着：
    “青青河，高高山，中国英雄万万年；我们心爱罗盛教，赞美的歌唱不完。”
    清明节，志愿军某部领导机关、朝鲜劳动党本地地方组织、朝鲜地方政府和人民军的代表和当地朝鲜居民等三百多人，前往罗盛教茔地扫墓。墓前堆满了花圈和挂着挽帐。崔?和他的父母在烈士墓前献上朝鲜人民最隆重的祭菜和祭酒。在清明节前，当地居民早在烈士墓上修添新土，加修了通往茔地的道路，路旁栽了两行松树，墓的周围也栽了许多小松树。在墓的前面，他们还修砌了一座二公尺多高五公尺长的弧形墓沿，和修筑了一块二十多平方公尺的小坪。
    劳动党村支部书记崔台元经常对大家说：“过去美国强盗在村前枪杀我们亲人，血把河水都染红了；可是，志愿军战士却在这河里牺牲自己来救活我们的子弟。这灾难，这友情，使人最难忘。我们永远不能忘记谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的亲人。”有一天，崔?的母亲泪光满脸地向邻人们说：“昨夜我梦见罗同志活着，胸前佩着英雄奖章，发着闪闪的金光。他满脸笑容，叫我阿妈妮，我乐哭了！这个可爱的孩子，我永远也忘不了啊！”
    崔?在今年春天曾写信给罗盛教在中国的父母，信上说：“罗同志为了救我而牺牲了自己的生命，我要继承罗同志的遗志，参加人民军，和志愿军同志一起去打败美国侵略者！”他随后毅然离开家庭，一个人走到数十里外找到了人民军，苦苦要求参加部队。人民军的指挥员和战斗员们早就传颂着罗盛教的英雄事迹，他们敬佩地围着崔?询问烈士的声音和容貌。人民军的军官对崔?的参军要求考虑了很久，后来还是因为他不到参军的规定年龄，勉励他回去好好生产，努力支援前线，到明年再来报名。
    不久，湖南新化县人民集会追悼罗盛教烈士的消息传到了这个村庄；崔?也接到了罗盛教父亲的来信。全村的人民都自动集会，劳动党村支部书记在会上报告了罗盛教故乡追悼烈士的情形。崔?在会上激动地把已经翻译成朝鲜文的罗盛教烈士的父亲的来信读给大家听。这封信上说：“盛教已经牺牲了，但是你还活着，我要把你当作盛教一样来看待。……”人们被烈士的父亲罗迭开的伟大的爱深深地感动，崔?流着泪接着念下去：“我真感谢那位把准备作自己的葬地拿来安葬盛教的朝鲜母亲和那些对待盛教如亲人一样的朝鲜人民，希望你把我的感激告诉他们。”
    在罗盛教烈士安葬的时候，全村的人民曾在烈士的墓前宣誓：保证要提早缴纳公粮，深耕细作，多打粮食，支援前线，坚决和美国侵略者斗争。现在，村民们用具体的行动来实践自己的誓言。他们在讨论增产支前的会议上，提出全村要增产公粮一万斤，比去年交的公粮增加二分之一。当人们举手通过这个决议时，他们高喊着：“为了罗盛教！”“为了胜利！”崔?跳上台去说：“我今年没有能够参加军队，我一定要在生产战线上当劳动英雄！”当场就有十几个青年参加了他组织的“罗盛教生产突击队”。
    春天，河水解冻了，山岭上呈现出绿色，播种的人们散布在村后的山上和村前的河边紧张地劳动着。这山是长白山的余脉，这河是大同江的支流，多少年来，这山和河一直没有名字；现在，人们把它光荣地命名为“罗盛教山”和“罗盛教河”，来永远纪念这个伟大的国际主义战士。（新华社）
