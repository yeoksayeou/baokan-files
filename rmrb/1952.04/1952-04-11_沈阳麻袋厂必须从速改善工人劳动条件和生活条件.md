    Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory Must Urgently Improve Workers' Labor and Living Conditions
    Labor Protection Department of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China
    The leading cadres of the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory are indifferent to the labor and living conditions of the workers, which seriously affects production and the workers' health. In November 1951, the attendance rate of workers in this factory was 95%, which dropped to 93.8% in December, and further dropped to 89.6% and 89.5% in January and February 1952. The lowest point was even 84%. The total number of workdays lost due to employee sick leave in January and February reached 3,732. Currently, an average of 160 to 170 people are taking sick leave every day. Among the workers directly involved in production in the factory, about 60% or more are working while ill. More than 90% of the doffers in the spinning workshop and the weft yarn group in the preparation workshop are sick. Among the patients, 40% suffer from bronchitis, 31% suffer from gastritis, and many others suffer from lung diseases. Of the more than 200 female workers, more than one-third are unable to work due to menstrual problems.
    Why is the attendance rate of the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory so low? Why is the health of the workers so poor? The main reason is that the workers' labor and living conditions are too harsh.
    The workshops of the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory lack proper ventilation equipment, and even small windows for ventilation are missing. The roof glass is covered with a thick layer of dust, preventing sunlight from entering. The room is filled with hemp dust, heat, machine oil smell, and the stench of retting hemp, making it difficult to breathe. In such air, some workers squat next to the machines to eat; when they open their lunch boxes, hemp dust falls into the food. This is the main reason why 80% of the employees have coughs.
    The dormitories where employees live are crowded and dirty. In some of the family dormitories, five or six families live in one room. The rooms have bunk beds, with two levels of occupants. Some families cannot get any sunlight at all. Those living upstairs have to carry rice and firewood up; the stairs are very steep and accidents often occur. In 1951, Wang Taifa's wife, who was eight and a half months pregnant, fell while climbing the stairs and had a miscarriage; Gu Jinghui's wife also had a miscarriage in the same way. The cooking pot is placed on the kang (heated brick bed); after eating, the pot is covered, the mat is laid down, and it becomes a "bed." Once, a worker's child climbed into the pot and was scalded. With so many families crowded together, one child crying affects everyone's sleep. The second dormitory, with more than 200 households, has only one women's toilet, and women have to queue to use it. The dirty water well in the courtyard is also broken. The single dormitories have large wooden plank kangs, with more than a dozen people living in each room, and three people have to sleep on two straw mats. The fourth dormitory, with more than 200 people, has no toilets, only latrine pits, and feces and urine are everywhere. There are no spittoons in the dormitories. More than a dozen workers suffering from lung diseases live together, and it was only recently decided to separate them. Even now, more than 280 old workers with families do not have dormitories. When new workers see that old workers don't have housing, they don't even dare to mention it. In August, September, and October of last year, some workers had nowhere to sleep and had to sleep in the railway station ticket office, and some even went to sleep in the bridge caves, and were sent back to the factory by the picket team three times.
    The entire factory has only one cafeteria. The lunch and rest time is set at fifty minutes; but it takes more than twenty minutes to travel back and forth from the factory to the cafeteria, and more than twenty minutes to eat and stand in line. Workers are afraid of not getting food, so they run as soon as they leave the factory; when they get to the cafeteria, they eat while panting; after eating, they hurry back to the factory. Workers living in the third and fourth dormitories have to walk more than forty minutes to eat in the cafeteria, and many workers sometimes simply do not go to the cafeteria. The food is also not good. According to doctors, the factory now has five or six hundred people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases.
    In addition, the factory originally worked nine hours a day, implementing large shifts; due to national production task needs, it has now been changed to small shifts, with one shift not being able to rest on Sundays. This has a certain impact on the workers' health.
    In order to complete the state's arduous gunny sack production tasks, the employees, despite being in such an environment, still work selflessly, even without resting on Sundays.
    The leading cadres of this factory have adopted an indifferent, bureaucratic attitude toward this serious situation that hinders production. The trade union work of the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory was once considered to be relatively "exemplary"; but from the current materials, the trade union work of this factory is quite superficial. Factory director Ma Yingjian, himself a corrupt official, is only concerned with embezzling state assets; he does not care about the workers' health and living problems. Last October, the Northeast Textile Administration allocated 10 million yuan to the factory to repair dormitories and the cafeteria, but the factory director has been slow to deal with it. Last winter, some dormitory windows had no glass, and they simply watched the workers use blackboards to block the wind, but did not install glass. This situation in the factory has not only been reflected today. In the past, whenever trade union cadres entered the workshop, workers would surround them and say: "There is no housing, the food is not good, and there is no way to treat illnesses." As early as last October, the factory trade union had repeatedly raised these issues to all parties, and the Shenyang Daily also criticized this situation, and the relevant departments also wrote reports. However, for five months, the problem has not been resolved. Some comrades walked around the factory, said "it's really difficult," and left; some didn't even ask a question.
    The reason for this phenomenon is not economic difficulty. In fact, as long as a little careful calculation is done, the problem can be gradually solved. Even if it is not possible to install proper ventilation equipment immediately, a small window can be opened first. Doing a good job of cleaning the workshop does not require a lot of money. Repairing the women's toilet and repairing the dirty water well are also easy to do. The workers are very angry about this. They said: "The higher authorities have said thousands of times that 'every worker is a valuable asset of the country,' but in reality, not a single problem has been solved."
    The chairman of the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory's trade union has been constantly reporting the serious situation of this factory to all relevant parties. After discovering this problem, the Northeast Regional Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China sent a special person to investigate and put forward suggestions for improvement. In order to ensure the completion of the state's production tasks and promptly resolve this serious problem, we agree with the opinions of the Northeast Regional Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and suggest that the following measures be taken immediately on the basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement: First, the administrative leadership should allocate a certain amount of funds under the principle of developing production to solve the workers' labor and living conditions problems, and improve the above serious situation within a limited time. Second, according to the factory's economic conditions, ventilation equipment should be installed before the summer of this year; currently, a few small windows can be opened temporarily to circulate air, and the workshop should be cleaned regularly. Third, the dormitories should be adjusted as much as possible, dormitory management should be strengthened, employees and their families should be educated, dormitory cleaning should be done well, water wells should be repaired, women's toilets should be added, the existing sanatorium beds should be expanded, and patients with infectious diseases should be isolated. Fourth, the existing houses (such as clubs) should be used to solve the cafeteria problem as soon as possible, and food management should be strengthened to ensure cleanliness; for workers who bring their own meals, equipment for heating food should be provided, and designated eating places should be provided outside the workshop. Fifth, if the small shift cannot be changed to a large shift temporarily due to production task needs, the administrative leadership should immediately start building dormitories, training new workers, and preparing to open three shifts.
    The trade union of this factory must organize all employees to fully demonstrate the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, wage an irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena that violate national policies and harm the interests of the working class, and effectively supervise the administrative side to ensure the necessary labor and living conditions for the workers.

    沈阳麻袋厂必须从速改善工人劳动条件和生活条件
    中国纺织工会全国委员会劳动保护部  
    沈阳麻袋厂的领导干部，对职工的劳动条件和生活漠不关心，严重地影响了生产和工人的身体健康。一九五一年十一月份，这个厂的工人出勤率是百分之九十五，十二月份就降为百分之九十三点八，一九五二年一、二月份降为百分之八十九点六和百分之八十九点五，最低时竟降到百分之八十四。一、二月份职工因病缺勤的工作日共达三千七百三十二个。现在平均每天都有一百六、七十人请病假。在厂直接生产的工人中，约有百分之六十以上的工人都是带病工作。精纺车间落纱工及准备车间纬线组的工人中，有百分之九十以上有病。病人中百分之四十患气管炎，百分之三十一患胃炎，此外，还有许多人患肺病。女工二百多人，就有三分之一以上因月经病不能工作。
    沈阳麻袋厂的出勤率为什么这么低？工人的健康状况为什么这么坏？最主要的原因是工人劳动条件和生活条件太恶劣。
    沈阳麻袋厂车间，没有正规的通风设备，连换气的小窗户都没有。屋顶玻璃上，有厚厚的一层灰，太阳光都射不进来。屋内充满麻灰、热气、机器油味、沤麻的臭味，使人呼吸困难。在这样的空气里，有的工人就蹲在机器旁边吃饭；打开饭盒，麻尘就落在饭里。这是百分之八十的职工有咳嗽病的主要原因。
    职工住的宿舍，又挤又脏。家属宿舍有的一间房子住五、六家。屋内有吊铺，分两层住。有的家根本照不到阳光。在上面住的，吃米、烧柴都得往上拿；楼梯很陡，常出危险。一九五一年，王太发的妻子怀孕八个半月，在上楼梯时跌下来，流产了；顾景辉的妻子也是这样流产的。饭锅是安在炕上的；吃完饭，把饭锅盖上，把席子放下，就成了“床”。有一次，有一个工人的小孩子爬到锅里被烫坏了。这样多的人家挤在一起，一家小孩哭了，就影响大家睡觉。第二宿舍二百多户，只有一个女厕所，妇女上厕所还得排队。院子里的脏水井也坏了。独身宿舍是大木板炕，每间房住十几个人，两个草垫子上要睡三个人。第四宿舍二百多人，没有厕所，只有便坑，大小便到处都有。宿舍里也没有痰盂。十几个患肺病的工人住在一起，最近才准备分开。直到现在，二百八十多个有家属的老工人还没有宿舍。新工人看到老工人都没房子住，就连提都不敢提了。去年八、九、十月间，有一部分工人没处睡，只好睡在火车站票房里，有的甚至到两孔桥洞子里去睡，曾有三次被纠察队送回厂来。
    全厂只有一个食堂。中午吃饭和休息时间规定为五十分钟；但从工厂到食堂，来回就要二十多分钟，连吃饭带站队又要二十多分钟。工人怕吃不上饭，拿不上饭碗，一出厂就跑；到了食堂，一面喘气，一面吃饭；吃完就赶快跑回厂去。在第三、四宿舍住的工人，到食堂吃饭就要走四十多分钟，许多工人有时就干脆不到食堂去吃。伙食也不好。据医生说：厂里现在有五、六百人患肠胃病。
    此外，厂里本来每天工作九小时，实行大倒班；由于国家生产任务需要，现已改为小倒班，两班中有一班在星期日不能休息。这对工人身体健康的恢复有一定的影响。
    职工们为了完成国家繁重的麻袋生产任务，虽处在这样的环境中，但仍忘我地进行工作，甚至连星期日都不休息。
    对于这样妨碍生产的严重情况，这个厂的领导干部却采取了漠不关心的官僚主义态度。沈阳麻袋厂的工会工作过去曾经被认为是比较“模范”的；但是从目前的材料看来，这个厂的工会工作是相当肤浅和表面的。厂长马应健，本身是个贪污犯，他所考虑的是如何贪污国家资财；对工人的身体健康和生活问题，却不放在心上。去年十月，东北纺织管理局批给这个厂一千万元，修理宿舍食堂，但厂长却迟迟不予办理。去冬，有些宿舍窗上没有玻璃，他们竟看着工人用黑板去挡风，但不给装玻璃。厂内这种情况，并不是今天才反映出来的。过去每当工会干部一进车间，工人就围上来说：“没有房子，吃不好饭，有病没法治。”早在去年十月，厂工会就曾几次向各方面提出过这些问题，沈阳日报也批评过这种情况，各有关部门也曾写过报告。但是，五个月来，问题始终没得到解决。有的同志到厂里走了一遍，说一声“真困难”，就走了；有的甚至连问都不问一声。
    发生这种现象的原因，并不是经济困难。实际上，只要稍加精打细算，问题就能逐步解决。即使马上不能安装正规的通风设备，也可以先开个小窗子。做好车间的清洁卫生工作，这并不要很多钱。修建一下女厕所，修补一下脏水井，也是容易办到的。工人因此很气愤，他们说：“上级说了千万遍‘每一个劳动者都是国家的宝贵资本’，但实际一个问题也没有解决。”
    沈阳麻袋厂的工会主席曾经不断地向各有关方面反映这个厂的严重情况。中国纺织工会东北区委员会发现了这一问题后，曾经派专人去作了调查，并提出了改进的意见。为了保证完成国家的生产任务，及时解决这一严重问题，我们同意中国纺织工会东北区委员会的意见，建议在“三反”运动的基础上，立即采取以下办法：一、行政领导方面应在发展生产的原则下，拨付一定的款项解决工人的劳动条件和生活条件问题，对以上的严重情况限期加以改善。二、根据厂里的经济条件，应在今年夏季以前装好通风设备；目前可暂时开几个小窗户，流通空气，并做好车间的经常的清洁卫生工作。三、尽可能调整一下宿舍，加强宿舍管理，教育职工和家属，做好宿舍清洁卫生工作；修建水井，增加女厕所，扩大现有疗养所床位，隔离传染病患者。四、应利用现有房屋（如俱乐部）尽速解决食堂问题，并加强伙食管理，做到清洁卫生；对于自己带饭的工人，应给以热饭的设备，并给他们在车间外指定吃饭地点。五、如果因为生产任务需要，小倒班暂时无法改为大倒班，行政领导方面应立即着手修建宿舍，训练新工人，准备开三班。
    这个厂的工会必须组织全体职工，高度发挥主人翁的精神，向一切违反国家政策、危害工人阶级利益的现象，进行不调和的斗争，切实监督行政方面保证工人必要的劳动条件和生活条件。
