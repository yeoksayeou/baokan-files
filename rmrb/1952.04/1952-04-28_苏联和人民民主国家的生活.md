    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Vietnamese Farmers Launch Summer Rice Planting Competition
    Farmers across Vietnam are enthusiastically responding to the Vietnamese government's call for increased production and frugality, and are fully engaged in summer rice planting. Farmers in liberated areas are launching competition movements for summer rice planting, diligently weeding and fertilizing. To ensure sufficient water in the rice paddies, farmers are building water conservancy projects on a large scale. Farmers in Nam Đàn District, Nghệ An Province, in Central Vietnam, built 37 small dams and repaired over 800 canals in just four days. People in Hương Khê District, Hà Tĩnh Province, also constructed dikes capable of irrigating approximately 800 hectares of rice paddies. Farmers in Lạng Sơn Province, North Vietnam, initiated a canal-digging irrigation movement, providing irrigation convenience to many previously uncultivable fields. People in Mỹ Sơn and Đồng Kinh areas near Lạng Sơn City worked day and night, completing the excavation of a 1,200-meter-long canal capable of irrigating 500 hectares of rice paddies ten days ahead of schedule.
    To increase grain production, Vietnamese farmers are cultivating land that has not been summer-cropped for many years. Farmers in Hà Giang Province cultivated 1,300 hectares of rice paddies, planting 45% more summer rice than in previous years. In Lập Thạch District, Vĩnh Phúc Province, North Vietnam, even the elderly participated in farming, resulting in 45% more summer rice planted than before.
    Farmers in various regions are promoting labor exchange teams and mutual aid groups in their cultivation. Many places are implementing collective sowing, widely promoting new working methods, and protecting rice paddies from damage by livestock.
    The competition movement to complete summer planting is unfolding enthusiastically across Vietnam. Many farmers are saying, "To thank President Ho Chi Minh and the Labor Party for their correct leadership, we must redouble our efforts and strive to achieve a bumper summer harvest this year."
    Labor Achievements of the People of the Mongolian People's Republic
    The people of the Mongolian People's Republic successfully completed the 1951 national economic and cultural development plan.
    The number of livestock in the state's animal husbandry sector increased by 18%. The livestock of the herders' cooperatives also increased by one-fifth.
    In agriculture, the Mongolian people also achieved great success. The grain sowing area expanded by 12.7%. The total grain harvest increased by 11%.
    Thanks to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Stakhanov working methods, many modern factories and enterprises in the Mongolian People's Republic, such as the "Stalin Meat Products United Factory" and the "Ulaanbaatar Wood Factory," exceeded their annual production plans. The production of blankets, wool fabrics, leather goods, clothing, and footwear increased by about 20% compared to last year.
    Large-scale construction projects have also been successfully completed. The Government Building of the Mongolian People's Republic, six power stations, many schools, clubs, hospitals, and public dormitories have all been built last year.
    Poland Prepares to Publish Literary Works Awarded Stalin Prizes
    The Polish National Publishing Bureau is actively preparing to publish a series of literary works awarded Stalin Prizes, including works by Soviet writers and writers from other countries.
    In addition, the Polish National Publishing Bureau also plans to publish a series of works by writers awarded the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin Peace Prize, so that the broad masses of the Polish people can further understand those outstanding fighters who are fighting to defend world peace.
    Both series will have special bindings and will be distributed in large quantities.
    Cultural Development in Albanian Villages
    The Albanian People's Government has created broad possibilities and necessary conditions for the cultural development of Albanian villages. Before national liberation, Albania had only 529 primary schools, mainly attended by the children of wealthy peasants, and secondary schools were very scarce. Today, there are 1,938 village primary schools and 138 secondary schools.
    The cultural centers, libraries, theaters, and other educational and cultural institutions in the cities provide great assistance to the development of the countryside. For example, in 1951, cultural centers organized 1,220 lectures and reports, 80 exhibitions, and so on in the villages. Before national liberation, the majority of Albanian farmers were illiterate; today, more than 192,000 men and women have learned to read and write.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    越南农民展开夏稻耕种竞赛
    越南全国农民现在正热烈响应越南政府增产节约的号召，全力进行夏稻耕种。解放区各地农民已经展开了夏稻耕种的竞赛运动，努力除草、施肥。为了保证稻田水量充足，农民们正大规模兴修水利。中越义安省南坛地区的农民只用了四天时间，就筑成了三十七个小水坝，修理了八百多条水渠。河静省香溪地区的人民也修筑了能够灌溉约八百公顷稻田的河堤。北越谅山省的农民发动了一个挖渠灌溉运动，使得许多原来不能耕种的田地得到了灌溉的便利。谅山城附近的美山和东京地区的人民日以继夜地工作，提前十天完成了挖掘一个长达一千二百公尺，能够灌溉五百公顷稻田的水渠。
    为了增加粮食的产量，越南农民在许多年来从不夏耕的田地上进行了耕耘。河江省的农民耕耘了一千三百公顷的稻田，比往年多种了百分之四十五的夏稻。北越永福省的立石区，老年人也参加耕作，结果比从前多种了百分之四十五的夏稻。
    各地农民在耕作中推行变工队和互助组。许多地方实行集体播种，广泛推行新的工作方法，保护稻田免遭家畜的损坏。
    争取完成夏耕的竞赛运动正在越南各地热烈展开。许多农民都说：“为了感谢胡志明主席和劳动党的正确领导，我们一定要加倍努力，争取今年夏季丰产的实现。”
    蒙古人民共和国人民的劳动成就
    蒙古人民共和国人民胜利地完成了一九五一年国民经济和文化发展计划。
    国家牧畜事业的牲畜数量增加了百分之十八。牧民合作社的牲畜也增加了五分之一。
    在农业方面，蒙古人民也获得了巨大的成就。谷物播种面积扩大了百分之十二点七。谷物总收获量增加了百分之十一。
    由于学习了苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作方法的先进经验，蒙古人民共和国的“斯大林肉食制品联合厂”、“乌兰巴托木器工厂”等许多现代化的工厂企业，都超额完成了全年的生产计划。毛毯、呢绒、皮货和衣着、鞋物等制品的生产量，比去年增加了约百分之二十。
    大规模的建设计划也顺利地完成了。蒙古人民共和国的政府大厦、六个发电站、许多学校、俱乐部、医院和公共宿舍都已在去年建立起来了。
    波兰筹备出版荣获斯大林奖金的文学作品
    波兰国家出版局正在积极筹备出版荣获斯大林奖金的文学作品的丛书，其中包括苏联作家的作品，也包括其他国家作家的作品。
    此外，波兰国家出版局还计划出版荣获“加强国际和平”斯大林和平奖金的作家的作品丛书，以使广大波兰人民进一步了解那些为保卫世界和平而斗争的卓越战士。
    这两种丛书都将作特别的装帧并将大量发行。
    阿尔巴尼亚乡村文化发展
    阿尔巴尼亚人民政府为阿尔巴尼亚乡村的文化发展创造了广泛的可能性和必要的条件。在全国解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚只有五百二十九所初等学校，就学的主要是富农的子女，中等学校是很缺乏的。现今已有一千九百三十八所村立初等学校和一百三十八所中等学校。
    各城市的文化之家、图书馆、剧院和其他教育及文化机关对乡村的发展予以极大的帮助。例如，在一九五一年，文化之家在乡村布置了一千二百二十次讲演和报告，八十次展览会等等。在国家解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚的多数农民都是文盲，在今天已有十九万二千多名男女学会读和写了。
