    Correcting Coercive Commandism in Drought Prevention and Resistance

    In the drought prevention campaign, some district and village cadres fail to conduct thorough publicity and enlighten the masses. Instead of carrying out drought prevention work according to the specific local conditions and in a manner appropriate to local circumstances, they pursue figures and formalities from the sole perspective of completing tasks. For example, in Xihe River Village, Chahar Province, 400 mu of land could be irrigated by digging earth wells, which is more labor-saving and effective than carrying ice. However, the village cadres did not lead the masses to dig wells, but blindly mobilized them to carry ice. Some people even neglected soil moisture preservation and land compaction because of carrying ice. In Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, some cadres dared not assign the task of drilling wells at the same time when arranging the task of digging wells. Huanglong Village, a cadre in the third district of the county, said: "If we ask the masses to drill wells, there will be enough water, and they will not dig wells." Under the leadership of cadres, the masses in Zhujia Village, Changzhi Mining Area, Shanxi Province, blindly dug wells. Each well could only irrigate four or five mu of land, resulting in waste.

    Because of this single-minded pursuit of tasks, the work style of coercive commandism has also emerged. The village chief and Party branch secretary of Dongbali Village, Hejian County, Hebei Province, forcibly assigned the task of digging wells and promoting waterwheels to each household. Many counties in Tangshan Prefecture have also experienced this phenomenon. Militiamen in Dongdapo, Luan County, told the masses: "Anyone who can breathe must go to haul ice." Some villages even implemented blockades, prohibiting people from going to market, so that the masses would all go to haul ice. Some cadres in Anci County even took back the brick houses distributed to the masses during the land reform and tore them down to use the bricks for digging wells.

    This coercive commandism not only fails to stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for drought prevention and resistance and complete the tasks of drought prevention and resistance, but also dampens the masses' enthusiasm for drought prevention, resistance, and spring plowing. At present, some areas have begun to pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of coercive commandism, but some areas still have this bias. Leading organs in various localities must prevent and correct this in a timely manner.

### 纠正防旱抗旱工作中的强迫命令现象

    纠正防旱抗旱工作中的强迫命令现象
    在防旱运动中，有一部分区村干部，不深入宣传，启发群众，按照当地的具体情况，因地制宜地开展防旱工作；而是从单纯完成任务的观点出发，追求数字和形式。例如察哈尔省西河河村，有四百亩地可以打土井浇水，这比背冰省工，收效也大；但是，该村干部却不领导群众打井，只是盲目地发动群众背冰。有的人竟因背冰影响了保墒压地。河北省成安县有的干部在布置打井任务时，不敢同时布置锥井任务。该县三区干部黄龙村说：“若叫群众锥井，水多了够用了，他们就不打井了。”山西省长治工矿区朱家庄群众在干部领导下，盲目打井，一眼井只能浇四、五亩地，成为一种浪费。
    因为有了这种单纯任务观点，强迫命令的作风也就随之产生了。河北省河间县东八里村村长和党支部书记，把打井和推广水车的任务强行分配到各户。唐山专区许多县也发生过这种现象。滦南县东大坡民兵对群众说：“凡会出气的人都得去拉冰。”有的村甚至实行封锁，不许赶集，以便让群众都去拉冰。安次县有些干部把土地改革时分给群众的砖房，也收回拆掉，用砖打井。
    这种强迫命令作风，不仅不能发挥群众防旱抗旱的积极性，完成防旱抗旱任务，反而打击了群众的防旱、抗旱、春耕生产情绪。目前有的地区已开始注意纠正强迫命令现象，但有些地区，还有这种偏向。各地领导机关必须及时加以防止和纠正。
