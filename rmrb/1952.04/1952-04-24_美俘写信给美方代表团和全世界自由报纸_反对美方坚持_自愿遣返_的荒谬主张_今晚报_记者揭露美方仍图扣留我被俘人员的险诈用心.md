Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from Kaesong on the 17th: American POWs in POW Camp No. 1 in North Korea have written to the United Nations Command delegation at Panmunjom and to free newspapers worldwide. The original letter is as follows: To the United Nations Command Delegation at Panmunjom (March 26th), Gentlemen:

	We are American POWs in POW Camp No. 1 in North Korea, and we sincerely hope for the repatriation of all POWs. Since last July, we have been anxiously following the development of the armistice negotiations. Many times in the past, we had high hopes, but these hopes were dashed due to new obstacles in the negotiations. The major obstacle now seems to be the issue of voluntary repatriation proposed by the United Nations Command. Most of us have been POWs for a year or more, and we hope to be unconditionally and fully repatriated. We believe that Chinese and Korean POWs also have this reasonable desire.

	We hope that you will consider our common wishes in the negotiations and strive to complete the negotiations as soon as possible. Open Letter to Free Newspapers Worldwide (March 27th)

	We, the undersigned, wish to express to the world our sincere desires and opinions regarding the long-debated issue of POW repatriation currently being discussed at Panmunjom.

	First, we would like to raise the question: Since the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that "all POWs shall be repatriated unconditionally and completely" after the cessation of hostilities, and the United States is one of the major signatories to this Convention, why is this issue causing so much controversy? We really don't know what the United Nations is up to. Some of our POWs have received letters from their families saying that they cannot understand what is hindering the peace talks and why the United Nations Command wants to detain captured personnel of the Communist forces.

	It is obvious that voluntary repatriation is indeed very unfair and directly violates and undermines the provisions of the Geneva Convention. We seriously doubt whether voluntary repatriation is genuine under the current conditions in the United Nations Command's POW camps.

	We sincerely hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible so that POWs on both sides can soon return to their deeply missed families. Therefore, we call on all peace-loving people around the world to work together to fight for an early resolution to this issue and not allow the United Nations Command to create further obstacles and make unfair proposals.

	Respectfully, twenty-two POWs (signatures)

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Béchet, a reporter for the Paris "Tonight's News," reported from Kaesong on the 22nd: The U.S. attempts to detain large numbers of Korean POWs under a veil of secrecy, a situation that has been confirmed in a teleconference between Ridgway and Truman's special assistant, Stillman. Two weeks ago, Ridgway claimed that the ceasefire negotiations were making progress, thus stirring up a wave of optimism. Now he doubts whether an agreement can be reached at all. Ridgway spoke directly about the POW issue, saying that the main obstacle hindering progress is the POW issue, which is actually the U.S. attitude towards the "value of human life" and their refusal to repatriate "Communist prisoners who would be in danger of their lives as a result." While the U.S. is trying to destroy the entire population of North Korea, they nauseatingly say that they respect the lives and safety of Chinese and Korean POWs; the treachery of their intentions can truly be said to have reached an extreme. Soldiers on both sides are losing their lives every day on the front lines, and the U.S. is still hindering negotiations on this issue. The U.S. has admitted to killing 252 Korean POWs on Geoje Island in less than a month. It is well known that tens of thousands of Chinese and Korean POWs and captured civilians have been brutally murdered under the orders of MacArthur and Ridgway. If Ridgway insists on detaining large numbers of Chinese and Korean POWs under the pretext of the U.S. concern for the fate of Chinese and Korean POWs, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations, then world opinion knows who should be held responsible. The 1949 Geneva Convention on POWs, which the U.S. participated in drafting, clearly stipulates that all POWs should be released and repatriated; if the U.S. abided by this Convention, the POW "problem" would not exist.

    美俘写信给美方代表团和全世界自由报纸
    反对美方坚持“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张
    “今晚报”记者揭露美方仍图扣留我被俘人员的险诈用心
    【新华社二十三日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿十七日自开城报道：朝鲜北部第一号战俘营的美国战俘已写信给在板门店的联合国军代表团，并写信给全世界的自由报纸。原信如下：致板门店联合国军代表团（三月二十六日）先生们：
    我们是朝鲜北部第一战俘营的美国战俘，我们衷心希望遣返全部战俘。从去年七月以来，我们一直焦急地注意停战谈判的发展。过去有许多次我们曾抱过很大的希望，但是由于谈判遇到新的障碍，这些希望都落了空。现在的大障碍似乎是联合国军方面提出的自愿遣返问题。我们当中的大多数人都当了一年或一年以上的战俘，我们希望能被无条件全部遣返，我们相信中国和朝鲜的战俘也抱有这种合理的愿望。
    我们希望你们在谈判中考虑我们的共同愿望，争取早日完成谈判。致全世界自由报纸的公开信（三月二十七日）
    我们在下面签名的人愿意向全世界表示我们对现在正在板门店讨论的争论已久的遣返战俘问题的真诚愿望和意见。
    我们首先要提出这样一个问题：既然日内瓦公约明文规定，在敌对行动停止以后，“所有战俘应无条件全部遣返”，而且美国又是这个公约的主要签字国之一，为什么这个问题会引起这样多的争论呢？我们真不知道联合国的葫芦里卖的是什么药。我们有些战俘接到他们家属的来信说，他们不能理解什么东西在阻挠和平谈判，为什么联合国军要扣留共产党军队的被俘人员。
    显而易见，自愿遣返的确是很不公平的，而且直接违反和破坏日内瓦公约的规定。我们非常怀疑，在目前联合国军战俘营里的那种情况下，自愿遣返是不是真实的。
    我们衷心希望这个问题能够早日得到解决，以便双方战俘能够很快回到他们深深怀念的家庭。因此我们要求全世界一切爱好和平的人民合力为早日解决这个问题而斗争，不让联合国军方面再制造障碍和提出不公平的建议。
    二十二个战俘敬启（签名）
    【新华社二十三日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌二十二日自开城报道：美方企图在秘密帘幕下扣留大批朝鲜战俘，这种情况在李奇微和杜鲁门的特别助理斯蒂尔曼进行的电视电话谈话中已得到证实。两个星期以前，李奇微扬言停火谈判正在取得进展，从而掀起了一阵乐观的浪潮。现在他又怀疑到底能不能达成协议。李奇微直接谈到战俘问题，他说妨碍进展的主要障碍是战俘问题，其实是美方在“人命的价值”方面所持的态度以及他们拒绝遣返“会因此受到生命危险的共产党俘虏”的态度。美方一面竭力想毁灭朝鲜北部的全体人民，一面令人作呕地说美方尊重朝中战俘的生命和安全，他们用心的险诈真可以说已达到了极点。前线上每天都有双方的战士丧失性命，而美方仍然在这个问题上阻挠谈判。美方已承认在不到一个月的时间中在巨济岛杀害了二百五十二名朝鲜战俘。大家知道，成万的朝中战俘和被俘平民已被麦克阿瑟和李奇微下令惨杀。如果李奇微一味以美方担心朝中战俘的命运做藉口扣留大批朝中战俘，结果使谈判陷于破裂的话，那么，全世界的舆论是知道谁应当负责的。美方参加起草的一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约就明白规定应当释放和遣返全部战俘；如果美方遵守这个公约的话，战俘“问题”是不会发生的。
