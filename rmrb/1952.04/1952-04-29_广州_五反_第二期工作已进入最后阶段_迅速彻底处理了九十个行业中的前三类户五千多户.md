    Guangzhou's Second Phase of "Five-Anti" Campaign Enters Final Stage
    Over 5,000 Households in the Top Three Categories of Ninety Industries Swiftly and Thoroughly Processed
    The second phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou has entered its final stage. The powerful inspection teams dispatched by the Guangzhou Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee simultaneously entered eighty illegal industrial and commercial households who refused to confess on the 22nd to conduct strict inspections.
    The second phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou began on April 7th. This phase was conducted simultaneously in seventeen key industries such as automotive equipment, construction, and chemical raw materials, and seventy-three general industries such as batteries and mills. The characteristic of the second phase was the resolute implementation of the working principle of fully mobilizing and relying on the worker masses. From the beginning, great efforts were made to mobilize the worker masses. Under the leadership of the Worker Department of the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee, more than 6,000 cadres from trade unions at all levels and activists from workers and shop assistants in various industries formed a strong worker team. At the beginning of this phase, they went to ninety industries to mobilize the broad masses of workers and shop assistants to participate in the battle. With the efforts of the worker teams and worker-shop assistants, senior staff also washed their hands and returned to the team. Workers and shop assistants in ninety industries quickly formed an organized and powerful force. They launched back-to-back or face-to-face struggles with illegal industrialists and businessmen, forcing many of them to confess their illegal activities and apologize to the workers and shop assistants. On this basis, the Guangzhou Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee swiftly and thoroughly handled more than 5,000 households in ninety industries who were law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and half law-abiding and half illegal. In order to strive for meritorious service and redeem their crimes, these leniently treated illegal capitalists organized "Industrial and Commercial Circles Persuasion Teams," using "insiders" to persuade "insiders." At the same time, under the promotion of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, many family members of workers and shop assistants and family members of leniently treated illegal capitalists also formed a large number of "Family Persuasion Teams." By this time, a united front of the "Five-Anti" movement, based on workers and shop assistants, had been formed, and the few illegal capitalists in ninety industries who refused to confess had been isolated.
    In order to completely break the resistance of illegal capitalists, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee ordered inspection teams to go to the factories and shops of eighty illegal capitalists who refused to confess on the 22nd for inspection. Worker teams, industrial and commercial circles persuasion teams, and family persuasion teams also moved out at the same time to closely coordinate work. Faced with such powerful force, most of the inspected illegal capitalists wavered, and they requested a final opportunity to confess. In order to encourage them to genuinely and sincerely repent, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee approved their request and ordered the inspection teams that had entered these factories and shops to postpone the inspection. For a portion of illegal capitalists who continued to resist, strict inspections were immediately carried out, and the excavation of these capitalists' "five poisons" would not stop until they were thoroughly exposed.

    广州“五反”第二期工作已进入最后阶段
    迅速彻底处理了九十个行业中的前三类户五千多户
    广州市“五反”运动第二期工作已进入最后阶段，市“五反”运动委员会派遣的强有力的检查队在二十二日同时开进了八十家拒不坦白的违法工商户进行严格的检查。
    广州市“五反”运动第二期工作在四月七日开始。这一期工作在汽车器材、营造、化工原料等十七个重点行业和电池、磨坊等七十三个一般行业中同时进行。第二期工作的特点是：坚决贯彻充分发动和依靠工人群众的工作方针，一开始就以极大的力量发动工人群众。在市“五反”运动委员会工人工作部的领导下，全市各级工会干部和各行业工人店员中的积极分子共六千多人组成了强大的工人工作队，在这一期工作开始时就分赴九十个行业中发动广大工人店员参加战斗。在工人工作队和工人店员的争取下，高级职员也纷纷洗手归队。九十个行业中的工人店员迅速形成了一支有组织的强大队伍。他们和不法工商业者展开了背靠背的或面对面的斗争，迫使许多不法工商业者坦白了自己的违法行为，并向工人店员低头认错。在这种基础上，广州市“五反”运动委员会迅速彻底地处理了九十个行业中的守法户、基本守法户和半守法半违法户共五千多户。这些受到宽大处理的违法资本家为了争取立功赎罪，纷纷组织“工商界规劝队”，以“内行人”来规劝“内行人”。同时在广州市民主妇女联合会的推动下，许多工人店员的家属和受到宽大处理的违法资本家的家属，也组成大批“家属规劝队”。至此，以工人店员为巩固基础的“五反”运动的统一战线形成，九十个行业中少数拒不坦白的违法资本家已陷于孤立。
    为了彻底打破违法资本家的顽抗，市“五反”运动委员会在二十二日命令检查队到八十户不肯坦白的违法资本家的工厂和商店进行检查，工人工作队、工商界规劝队、家属规劝队也同时出动，密切配合工作。在这样强大的威力前面，被检查的不法资本家大部分动摇了，他们请求给予最后坦白的机会。为了争取他们自动真诚悔过，市“五反”运动委员会批准了他们的请求，命令已进入这些厂店的检查队暂缓检查。对于一部分继续抗拒的违法资本家就立即着手进行严格检查，不彻底挖出这些资本家的“五毒”决不休止。    （新华社）
