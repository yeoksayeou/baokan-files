    People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Study Committee
    Holds Report Meeting on Crimes of U.S. Imperialism's Germ Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd] The Study Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a report meeting on the crimes of U.S. imperialism's germ warfare on the afternoon of the 3rd. Ke Bainian, a member of the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and Chen Qiyuan, head of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on Crimes of U.S. Imperialism's Germ Warfare," and members Liu Chongle, Peng Zemin, and Zhou Jianren were invited to report on the results of their investigations in Korea and Northeast China. More than 120 people attended the report meeting, including members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations, such as Li Jishen, Chen Shutong, Lin Boqu, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Hou Debang, Li Shucheng, and Fu Zuoyi.
    Ke Bainian reported on the significant gains made by the investigation team in Korea and Northeast China after conducting on-the-spot investigations. He said: The results of the investigation by the investigation team fully confirmed the ironclad facts of U.S. imperialism's germ warfare and other crimes, and all members of the investigation team reached a unanimous opinion on this. This conclusion has been announced to Chinese and foreign reporters by Brandweiner, the head of the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, at a reception on April 1st.
    Chen Qiyuan reported to everyone on the investigation process of the Northeast Branch of the investigation team in Northeast China, saying: From March 15th to 31st, during the seventeen days, the investigation team went to Shenyang, Fushun, Andong, Kuandian, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations, and came into contact with many reliable witnesses and material evidence, and collected a large amount of reliable evidence through investigation meetings and expert forums. The investigation results of the investigation team confirmed that: 1. U.S. imperialism dispatched aircraft to frequently and regularly intrude into China's airspace, constituting an act of aggression; 2. The American aggressors systematically and on a large scale spread a large number of germ-carrying insects and poisons on our Northeast territory, constituting a monstrous crime of killing humanity in violation of international law.
    Chen Qiyuan also praised the strong epidemic prevention force of the people of Northeast China, saying: The determination and wisdom of the great people are an invincible force. The workers, peasants, students, and scientists of Northeast China are closely united, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the sinister plot of U.S. imperialism has been shamefully defeated.
    In addition, entomologist Liu Chongle reported on his investigation of the germ bombs dropped by American aircraft outside the east gate of Kuandian County. Peng Zemin and Zhou Jianren successively pointed out from their own observations and experiences that U.S. imperialism used such vicious means and used bacteriological weapons to deal with us; this will never save its doomed fate. The people's awakening and strength will give the American aggressors an even greater blow.

    人民政协全国委员会学习委员会
    举行反对美帝国主义细菌战罪行报告会
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会在三日下午举行反对美帝国主义细菌战罪行的报告会。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团员柯柏年、“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团团长陈其瑗、团员刘崇乐、彭泽民、周建人应邀在会上报告了他们在朝鲜和东北进行调查的结果。参加报告会的有人民政协全国委员会委员、各民主党派和人民团体代表李济深、陈叔通、林伯渠、章伯钧、张奚若、许德珩、侯德榜、李书城、傅作义等一百二十多人。
    柯柏年在会上报告了调查团在朝鲜和我国东北地区进行实地调查后的重大收获，他说：调查团进行调查的结果，完全证实了美帝国主义进行细菌战以及其它罪行的铁的事实，并使调查团全体团员对此获得了一致的意见。这个结论已由国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长布兰德魏纳在四月一日的招待会上向中外记者公布。
    陈其瑗向大家报告调查团东北分团在东北的调查经过说：从三月十五日到三十一日的十七天中，调查团曾到沈阳、抚顺、安东、宽甸等地进行实地调查，接触到许多确实的人证和物证，用开调查会和专家座谈等方式搜集了大量可靠的证据。调查团调查的结果证实了：一、美帝国主义派遣飞机大批地经常地侵入我国领空，构成侵略行为；二、美国侵略者有计划地大规模地在我东北领土撒布大量带菌毒虫和毒物，构成违反国际公法的残杀人类的滔天罪行。
    陈其瑗并盛赞东北人民强大的防疫力量说：伟大的人民群众的决心和智慧是不可战胜的力量。东北的工人、农民、学生和科学家紧密地结合在一起，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，已使美帝国主义的毒辣的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    此外，昆虫学家刘崇乐报告了他在宽甸县城东门外勘查美国飞机投下的细菌弹的经过。彭泽民、周建人相继以亲身的观察体验指出美帝国主义下了这样的毒手，用细菌武器来对付我们；这决不能挽救其必败的命运。人民的觉悟和力量将给予美国侵略者以更大的打击。
