Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The crimes of the American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China continue to be strongly opposed by the people of various countries around the world.

　　In Weimar, the German Democratic Republic, former prisoners of the Buchenwald fascist death camp held an international conference on April 12th and 13th. Representatives from nineteen countries attended. All the delegates present resolutely protested the crime of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

　　Trade unions, sports federations and other organizations in Poland are donating funds to aid the Korean people who are suffering from the American imperialists' germ warfare. As of April 7th, the Polish people have donated 500,000 zlotys to purchase medicines and clothing for the Korean people. People throughout Poland continue to hold protest rallies. Professors, lecturers and staff of the Krakow Medical Academy unanimously passed a resolution at a conference saying: "We strongly protest the heinous crime of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. We believe that every kind person in the world should unite to protest this crime."

　　Romanian newspapers continue to publish articles denouncing the American imperialists for using bacteriological weapons. The "Spark" newspaper published an article by writer Alexandra Jar, entitled "Truman's 'New Allies'." He wrote: "Previously, American monopoly capitalists often boasted of their new cars, washing machines and ingenious razor blades. After a while, they boasted of other industrial products: rapid-fire cannons, electric machine guns, and aerial fortresses. Now, they are busy manufacturing the most shameful products: epidemics and plagues, etc." The author pointed out that it is most noteworthy that the imperialists of the United States and other countries cannot find better "allies" than an army of germ-carrying insects on their bloody path. For them, these soldiers are more reliable than human soldiers, because soldiers were originally people who demanded peace, work, and bread.

　　The Romanian People's Republic Church Federation, representing Baptist, Seventh-day Adventist, Evangelical, and Pentecostal Christians, protested against the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialists in Korea and Northeast China. The protest letter said: "We believe that germ warfare is an extremely inhumane act, which is not only inconsistent with international law, but also intolerable to the sacred precepts of Christian morality. The Romanian People's Republic Church Federation, together with millions of honest people around the world, and countless religious, cultural, educational, scientific organizations and trade unions across the country, demands an immediate end to germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and a ban on hateful bacteriological weapons."

　　In the United Kingdom, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, which has more than 350,000 members, held an annual meeting in Margate on April 15th and passed a resolution condemning the crime of the United States in conducting germ warfare in Korea, and called for a conference of great powers to consider the abolition of "weapons of terror" as a step towards disarmament and world peace. At the same time, the Edinburgh and East Scotland District Committee of the National Union of Railwaymen, representing 11,000 railway workers, also passed a resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War and calling on the five major powers to discuss peace and disarmament issues.

　　Professor Ossel, President of the French University Federation, said at the Federation's Congress that the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors against the Korean and Chinese people "is the most serious crime in history and arouses the anger of all honest people." Professor Ossel called on French scientists to protest this crime. At the same time, the Congress of Labor Inspectors and Social Insurance Workers of France also passed a resolution protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors.

　　The joint congress of the Finnish Democratic Youth League and the Finnish Democratic Pioneer League called on the United Nations to stop the germ warfare being carried out by the American intervention army in Korea and Northeast China.

　　The Iranian Peace Supporters Association's newspaper "Loyal Word" said: The newspaper's editorial board receives many letters every day, and the writers protest the barbaric war crimes of the American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China. These letters come from the Iranian National Association of Democratic Journalists, the editorial boards of some local newspapers, the tobacco factory workers' union, the workers of the "World News" printing plant, Iranian political prisoners, the Iranian Democratic Women's Federation, and many Iranian public figures and social celebrities.

　　Brazilian famous progressive writer and Chairman of the Brazilian Writers Association, Ramos, telegraphed Rafid, Secretary-General of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, saying: On behalf of the Brazilian Writers Association and in my own name, I resolutely protest the heinous crime of the international army under the banner of the United Nations in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. Brazilian peace supporters wrote to the Security Council, angrily protesting the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea. The letter said: This inhumane and heinous crime can only be compared with the evil deeds of the Nazis and Japanese militarists. The Brazilian people, like the people of all countries in the world, demand the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons, as well as any other weapons of aggression and weapons of mass destruction.

    世界各国人民继续举行集会通过决议
    愤怒斥责美国侵略者进行细菌战
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪行，继续遭受世界各国人民的强烈反对。
    在德意志民主共和国的魏玛地方，前布亨瓦尔德法西斯死亡营囚人在四月十二日和十三日举行了一个国际会议。出席的有十九个国家的代表。到会的全体代表坚决抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    波兰的工会、体育联合会和其他机关团体正在纷纷捐款援助受美帝国主义细菌战侵略的朝鲜人民。截至四月七日止，波兰人民已捐款五十万兹罗提作为给朝鲜人民购买医药品和衣物之用。波兰全国各地人民继续举行抗议大会。克拉科医学院的教授、讲师和职员在大会上一致通过决议说：“我们强烈抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。我们相信全世界每一个善良的人都应该联合起来抗议这一罪行。”
    罗马尼亚各报继续发表文章斥责美帝国主义者使用细菌武器。“火花报”发表了作家亚历山德拉·雅尔的文章，题为“杜鲁门的‘新盟友’”。他写道：“以前，美国垄断资本家们常常吹嘘他们的新型汽车、洗衣机和灵巧的剃刀片。待一会儿以后，他们又夸耀另外一些工业制品：连发大炮、电动机关枪、空中堡垒。现在，他们正在忙于制造最可耻的产品：疫病和瘟疫等等。”作者指出：最值得注意的是，美国和其他国家的帝国主义者在他们所走的血腥道路上，竟无法找到比带菌昆虫大军更好的“盟友”。对于他们来说，这些士兵比人的士兵更为可靠，因为士兵原先本是要求和平、工作和面包的人民。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国教会联合会代表浸礼派、基督复临安息日派、福音派和五旬节派的基督徒，抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器。抗议书说：“我们认为，细菌战是极端不人道的行为，不仅不合于国际公法，而且也不容于基督道德的神圣训诫。罗马尼亚人民共和国教会联合会和全世界千千万万正直的人民一道，和全国无数宗教、文化、教育、科学团体和工会组织一道，要求马上停止在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战，并禁止可恨的细菌武器。”
    在英国，拥有三十五万多名会员的店员、批销业及其他职工工会，四月十五日在马尔加特举行年会，通过一项决议，斥责美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行，并要求大国举行会议，以考虑废止“恐怖的武器”，作为走向裁减军备和世界和平的一步。同时，属于英国全国铁路工人工会、代表一万一千铁路工人的爱丁堡和东苏格兰区委员会，也通过一项决议，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，并要求五大国讨论和平及裁减军备问题。
    法国大学联合会主席奥塞尔教授在该联合会的代表大会上说：美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国人民进行的细菌战，“是历史上最严重的罪行，激起了一切正直人民的愤怒”。奥塞尔教授号召法国科学家抗议这种罪行。同时法国劳工视察与社会保险工作者代表大会也通过决议，抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器。
    芬兰民主青年联盟与芬兰民主少年先锋联盟联合代表大会向联合国呼吁，要求制止美国干涉军在朝鲜和中国东北所进行的细菌战。
    伊朗和平拥护者协会的报纸“忠言报”说：该报的社论委员会每天接到许多信件，写信的人都抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的野蛮的战争罪行。这些信件来自伊朗民主新闻工作者全国协会、一些地方报纸的社论委员会、烟草工厂工人工会、“世界报”印刷厂的工人、伊朗政治犯、伊朗民主妇女联合会以及许多伊朗公众和社会名流。
    巴西著名进步作家、巴西作家协会主席拉摩斯致电世界和平理事会执行局秘书长拉斐德说：我代表巴西作家协会，并以我本人的名义，坚决抗议打着联合国旗号的国际军队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的滔天罪行。巴西和平拥护者写信给安全理事会，愤怒地抗议美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器。信上说：这种不人道的滔天罪行，只有纳粹与日本军国主义者的罪恶行为可以相比。巴西人民与世界各国人民一样，要求无条件禁止原子武器和细菌武器，以及任何其它侵略的武器和大规模消灭人类的武器。
