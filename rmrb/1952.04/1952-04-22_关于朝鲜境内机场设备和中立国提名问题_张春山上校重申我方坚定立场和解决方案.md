Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 21st: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on the 21st, our chief staff officer Colonel Zhang Chunshan once again explained our position and solutions regarding the remaining issues of the third agenda item, pointing out that the other side's insistence on unreasonable demands on various agenda items in the negotiations made it impossible for the armistice talks to make any progress. Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out:

    "(1) Regarding the so-called issue of restricting airport equipment in North Korea. In your statement yesterday, you once again raised the so-called excuse that military strength should not be increased during the armistice period. Our side has long pointed out that if your side, like our side, is willing to truly abide by the agreement and not bring in reinforcing military forces, including combat aircraft, from outside North Korea during the armistice period, it will be impossible for either side's military strength to increase. As for whether or not to build airport equipment within North Korea during the armistice period, this is entirely a matter of our internal affairs, and your side has no right to interfere. Our side will never allow the slightest interference in our internal affairs. This is our final and unchangeable position.
    (2) Your side believes that the issue of neutral nation nominations is no longer a problem. You know that whether this is a problem or not is not unilaterally decided by your side. The issue of neutral nation nominations is a very big problem. The reason it has become a problem is because your side has unreasonably refused to accept a country proposed by our side that fully meets the definition of a neutral nation. The reason it has become a problem is because your side has unreasonably changed the already reached agreement and insisted on using four neutral nations to replace six neutral nations to organize the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This cannot solve the problem. Our reasonable solution is very clear: either both sides simultaneously and in one go agree to all of each other's neutral nation nominations, or both sides respectively propose three countries that meet the definition of a neutral nation, without any approval procedures. This is the most reasonable way to solve the problem. Your side has no reason to continue to oppose our reasonable solution.
    (3) Your side claimed at yesterday's meeting that the progress of the meeting depends on the efforts of both sides, but in fact, your side is insisting on your unreasonable demands on various agenda items in the negotiations. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for the armistice talks to make any progress. In order for the meeting to progress, your side must abandon your unreasonable demands."

At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the staff members of both sides continued to exchange opinions on the issue of prisoner repatriation, and the meeting made no progress.

    关于朝鲜境内机场设备和中立国提名问题
    张春山上校重申我方坚定立场和解决方案
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方首席参谋张春山上校再次说明了我方对于第三项议程剩余问题的立场和解决方案，指出对方在谈判中的各项议程上坚持无理要求的态度，使停战谈判不可能有任何进展。张春山上校指出：
    “（一）关于所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的问题。你方在昨天的发言中，再次提出了所谓停战期间，军事力量不得有所增加的藉口。我方早已指出：如果你方和我方一样，愿意确实遵守双方协议，在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内，双方的军事力量就不可能有所增加。至于停战期间朝鲜境内机场设备的修建与否，完全属于我方内政问题，你方没有任何权利过问。我方也决不容许对于我方内政的丝毫的干涉，这是我方最后的、不可更改的立场。
    （二）你方认为中立国提名问题已经不成为一个问题，你知道这成不成为一个问题，不是由你方片面决定的。中立国提名问题这是一个很大的问题，其所以成为问题，就是由于你方毫无理由地拒绝接受我方提出的完全合乎中立国定义的一个国家，其所以成为问题，就是由于你方毫无理由地更改已经达成的协议，主张以四个中立国来代替六个中立国组织中立国监察委员会，这是不能解决问题的。我方的合理解决方案是很清楚的，要就是双方同时并一次同意对方的全部中立国提名，要就是双方各自提出三个合乎中立国定义的国家，而不进行任何同意手续，这是解决问题最合理的办法。你方没有任何理由继续反对我方的合理解决方案。
    （三）你方在昨日的会议上声称，会议的进展有赖于双方的努力，但事实上你方却在谈判中的各项议程上坚持你方的无理要求，在这种情况下，停战谈判是不可能有任何进展的。为了会议的进展，你方必须放弃你方的无理要求。”
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方参谋人员继续就遣俘问题交换意见，会议无进展。
