    Commemorating the Great Scientist Leonardo da Vinci
    Chen Yiting
    Leonardo da Vinci, a brilliant genius in history, an Italian painter, sculptor, musician, scientist, architect, and engineer, was born on April 15, 1452, exactly five hundred years ago. He was born in the European Renaissance. In Europe, the emerging bourgeoisie began to overthrow the power of the feudal aristocracy at that time, and modern European countries and modern capitalist societies began to develop from that time. At the same time, forerunners of the proletariat appeared in the German Peasants' War, foreshadowing future class struggles. At that time, in the face of the radiant image of the revived classical ancient Greek civilization, Italy experienced an unexpected period of artistic prosperity; new literature was also produced in Western European countries—this was the embryo of modern literature. Flourishing free thought was taking root day by day, preparing the ground for the materialism of the eighteenth century. Natural science also achieved its systematic and comprehensive new development in the vortex of the bourgeois democratic revolution at that time. Leonardo da Vinci can be said to be one of the most outstanding great figures produced in that great era, extremely proficient in both art and science. History tells us that never before has there been a person like da Vinci who possesses both artistic and scientific talents; his intelligent mind has a wealth of keen aesthetic sense, and also contains just as many scientific ideals; he is truly a rare genius, truly regarded as the greatest typical example of a polymath in the Renaissance.
    In art, da Vinci's achievements are mainly in painting. He surpassed not only his predecessors but also his contemporaries in painting. The fundamental difference between him and the artists of his time lies in his unwillingness to limit his artistic development to imitating ancient models. He learned from nature, he sought the model for his works from the living natural world and living people, with his own unique and original style. In this sense, it can be said that he revolutionized the art of painting. He was the first painter to recognize the importance of light and shade in the most moving and beautiful appearances of the world. He had a very keen sense and understanding of the contrast between colors and light and shade, and the harmony between the two. He not only paid attention to various external appearances, but also tirelessly explored their underlying causes and laws. Undoubtedly, his research in various natural sciences, especially physiology, anatomy, and optics, helped him solve many problems in artistic creation; he was the first to perfectly combine scientific knowledge and artistic creation. He once said: The problem of art is the problem of science. For example, in order to build an equestrian monument to Ludovico Sforza, he devoted himself to studying the movements of horses and the anatomy of horses, as well as the large-scale bronze casting technique; in order to make his paintings beautiful and lifelike, he studied the laws of light and shadow and the theory of perspective. These were things that his predecessors and contemporaries could not do. He was good at portraying various psychological expressions on people's faces, and he was also good at depicting landscapes of the earth. He liked to use landscapes as the background in his paintings. His genius is manifested in the perfect harmony, form, and artistic meaning of the figures and scenery in his paintings. From an early age, he found in the depiction of life the combination of the most delicate precision and vividness of expression with the rhythm of lines. His beautiful paintings always amaze people with the real life they reflect; this is the greatest of the many great qualities of his artistic expression. His most famous works include masterpieces such as "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa."
    In science, da Vinci was an anatomist, physiologist, botanist, physicist, mathematician, geologist, astronomer.... He enthusiastically studied every theoretical and applied science of his time with observation and experimental methods, some of which he was the first to begin studying. In many respects, his research achievements far exceeded those of his contemporaries. He was the first to advocate that moonlight is the reflection of sunlight; that the earth's surface is changing. The discovery of the laws of light and shade led this tireless researcher to the study of perspective theory, and from perspective theory to the study of optics, the physiology of the eye, the anatomy of the human body and other animals, the movement of muscles, and the growth and structure of plants. He also conducted in-depth research and experiments in hydraulics, statics and dynamics, material strength, and mechanical principles. He once devoted himself to the study of mathematics and physics problems for months without interruption, forgetting to eat and sleep. Some of the earliest experiments on frictional resistance were done by da Vinci. From these experiments, he derived the law of friction; from a sketch in his notebook of an object resting on an inclined plane, it can be inferred that he was the first person to have a clear concept of the "angle of repose," and he may have derived the coefficient of friction based on this. In short, in terms of natural science, he was the first modern person to study many problems that countless researchers have worked hard to solve in later generations. His greatness lies in the combination of his theory and practice. He was full of novel ideas about the laws of mechanics and their applications. He was the greatest and most successful architect and engineer of the time. His architectural and engineering plans were bold, progressive, and had an astonishing scale. He was the architect of various public buildings; he participated in the construction of the famous and beautiful Milan Cathedral; he confidently proposed an amazing plan to move the Baptistery of Saint John in the city of Florence to another part of the city and raise it on a solemn and magnificent marble base. In terms of field work, he designed canals, built seaports, and so on. He was always absorbed in thinking about and researching various related problems in physical geography and engineering. In order to improve the irrigation canal system in the Romellina and Longba plains, he designed many new projects; he enthusiastically studied the effects of rivers, the structure of mountains, and the phenomena of thunderstorms. He was also a very imaginative inventor. He invented the anemometer, hygrometer, dredger, canal lock, and so on. He dreamed of building flying machines. According to expert speculation, if he could have obtained some kind of power, he might have completed his flying machine. He also knew a method that could stay submerged in water for a long time.
    Da Vinci was not only a great artist and scientist of that era, but he was also a great humanist of that era; he loved peace and hated unjust wars. When he was in Florence, he was ordered to create a painting for the city that could rival the one he created for Milan; he chose a scene of war for this painting. This was not because he liked war; in his notes, he used the term "bestial frenzy" to express his hatred for unjust wars; he painted this war scene full of horror, which was his exposure of this bestial madness and brutality. The great da Vinci typically embodies the noble spirit of mankind's endless pursuit of conquering nature for its own happiness. His name and his achievements are immortal.

    纪念伟大的科学家辽·达·芬奇
    陈一霆
    历史上杰出的伟大天才，意大利画家、雕刻家、音乐家、科学家、建筑家、工程师，辽·达·芬奇生于一四五二年四月十五日，距今整五百周年。他正是生在欧洲的文艺复兴时代。在欧洲，那时候新兴的资产阶级开始打垮了封建贵族的权力，而近代的欧洲国家和近代的资本主义社会从那时起就开始发展起来了。同时，在德国农民战争中出现了无产阶级的先驱者，预示了日后的阶级斗争。那时候，在复现的古典的古代希腊文明的光辉形象的面前，意大利出现了一段预想不到的艺术繁荣时期；西欧各国也都产生了新文学——这就是近代文学的胚胎。而欣欣向荣的自由思想，又一天天在生着根，准备下了十八世纪的唯物论。自然科学也在当时资产阶级民主革命的漩涡中取得了它的系统的、全面的新发展。辽·达·芬奇可以说是在那个伟大时代所产生的伟大人物之中的最为出色的一个，他在艺术上和科学上各方面都极为擅长。历史告诉我们，过去从来未曾有过一个人像芬奇那样一身兼具艺术上和科学上的天赋；在他的智慧的头脑中有着丰富的敏锐的美感，也蕴藏着同样多的科学的理想；他实在是一旷古的奇才，真正算得是文艺复兴时代博学多艺人物的最伟大的典型范例。
    在艺术上，芬奇的成就主要的是绘画。他在绘画艺术上不仅超过了前代的人，并且也超过了同时代的人。他和同时代的艺术家们的基本区别乃是在于他不愿将他在艺术上的发展局限于古代范本的临摹上。他向自然学习，他从活的自然界中和活的人物上寻找自己的作品的典范，以他自己特有的天才独创风格。在这一意义上，可以说，他革新了绘画的艺术。他是第一位认识到光的明暗在世界的那些最动人的优美外观上所占的重要性的画家，他对于色调及光的明暗的对衬以及二者的调和有极敏锐的感觉和领会。他不仅止于注意各种各样的外观表象，而且还不倦地探求其潜在的原因和规律。无疑的，他对各门自然科学，尤其是生理学、解剖学及光学的研究，帮助他在艺术创作上解决了许多问题；他是第一位把科学知识和艺术创作完美地结合起来的人。他曾说：艺术的问题就是科学的问题。例如，为了建造一个骑马的卢多维珂·斯佛尔查纪念碑，他潜心研究马的动作和马的解剖学以及青铜的大量铸造术；为了使他的画幅优美逼真，他研究了明暗律和透视理论。这些都是他的前辈和同时代人所做不到的。他精于刻画人的面部的各种心理上的表情，也善于描绘大地山川景物。他很喜欢以山川景物作他的画中的背景。他的奇才就表现在他的画中人物和景物的那种完美的调和、形式及艺术的意味。从早期起，他就在对于生活的描绘中找到了把表达刻画的最细致的精确性和生动性与线条的韵律结合起来。他的优美的画幅总是令人惊叹于它所反映的真实的生活；这是他的艺术表现的许多伟大品质中的最伟大的一点。他的最著名的作品有“最后的晚餐”和“蒙娜丽莎”等等杰作。
    在科学方面，芬奇是解剖学家、生理学家、植物学家、物理学家、数学家、地质学家、天文学家……。他热心地以观察和实验方法研究着在他那时代所有的每一门理论的和应用的科学，其中有些并且是他所首先开始研究的。在许多方面他的研究成就都远超过了他的同时代人。他首先倡说：月光就是太阳光的反射；地球表面是在变化的。明暗律的发现将这位不倦的研究者引向透视理论的研究，又从透视理论研究到光学、眼的生理学、人体和其他动物的解剖学、肌肉的动作、植物的生长和构造等的研究。在水力学、静力学和动力学、材料强度和机械原理等方面，他也都做过深入的研究和实验。他曾经有数月之久毫不间断地废寝忘食地埋头于数学和物理学各项问题的研究。最早的关于摩擦阻力的一些实验就是芬奇所做的。从这些实验中他得出了摩擦定律；由他的笔记本中所画的一个物体停在一个斜面上的素描看来，可推想而知他是第一位对于“休止角”有了清楚的概念的人，他或许就是根据这而求出了摩擦系数。总之，在自然科学方面他是近代人中首先从事研究许多为后世无数的研究者们所努力钻研解决的问题的人。他的伟大之处就在于他的理论与实践的结合。他满怀着关于力学定律及其应用的新奇理想。他是当时的最伟大、最成功的建筑家、工程师。他的建筑和工程计划大胆、进步，具有惊人的气魄。他曾是各种公共建筑物的建筑师；他曾经参与建筑著名的极美观的米兰教堂；他曾以充足的信心提出了一个惊人的计划，要把佛罗仑斯城内的圣约翰洗礼堂迁移到该城的另一部分去，并把它升高在
    一庄严堂皇的大理石台基上。在野外工作方面，他曾设计开凿运河、修筑海港等等。他总是全神贯注地思考研究着自然地理和工程学的各种有关的问题。为了改善罗梅利纳和隆巴平原一带的灌溉水道系统，他设计了许许多多新的工程；他热心地研究着河流的作用、山脉的结构和雷雨的现象。他并且是
    一位极富于想像力的发明家。他发明了风力计、湿度计、挖泥机、运河水闸等等。他曾幻想制造飞翔的机械。据专家的推断，假若他能得到某种动力，他或许可以完成他的飞翔机械。他还知道一种可以长时间在水中潜留的方法。
    芬奇不仅是那时代的博学多艺的伟大艺术家、科学家，他并且还是那时代的伟大人道主义者；他喜爱和平，憎恶非正义的战争。他在佛罗仑斯时曾奉命为该城创作一幅可以和他为米兰创作的相媲美的画；他为这幅画选取了一个战争的场面。这并不是因为他喜欢战争；在他的笔记中，他曾以“兽性的狂暴”一语来表示他对非正义的战争的憎恶；他把这个战争场面画得充满了恐怖，就是他对这种兽性的疯狂残暴的揭露。伟大的芬奇典型地表现了人类为了自己的幸福对征服自然的永无止境的探求的崇高精神。他的名字和他的成就是永垂不朽的。
