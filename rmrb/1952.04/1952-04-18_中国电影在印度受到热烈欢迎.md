    The Indian International Film Festival opened in Bombay on January 24, 1952, and closed in Calcutta on March 6. Films from 23 countries participated in the exhibition. Among them, China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom were the 12 countries that sent delegations to participate in the film festival. A total of 62 feature films and major documentaries (over 8,000 feet) and 63 newsreels from various countries participated in the exhibition. In the film exhibition of the Indian International Film Festival, the films of China and the Soviet Union were the most popular with the audience. Films from Czechoslovakia and Hungary also received good responses.
    The Chinese film delegation was composed of six people including Wu Yinxian, and brought four films. During the film festival, a total of 54 screenings were held in four cities, namely Bombay, Madras, Delhi, and Calcutta, in the form of public screenings and receptions ("The White Haired Girl" 28 screenings, "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" 11 screenings, "Steel Fighter" 9 screenings, "Radiance" 6 screenings), with more than 55,600 viewers.
    "The White Haired Girl" received universal praise from all walks of life in India. "Steel Fighter" received high evaluation. When the scenes of heroes enduring hardships and being brave and unyielding appeared on the screen, the audience gave the heroes great admiration and sympathy, and were moved to tears by the heroes. When the scene of the People's Liberation Army launching a large-scale counter-offensive appeared in front of the audience, they were sincerely excited and encouraged, and responded with warm and long-lasting applause. In "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," whenever Chairman Mao appeared, the audience expressed their high respect with warm applause. Even in "Radiance," when Chairman Mao's portrait appeared on the screen, the audience applauded enthusiastically.
    Friends in the Indian film industry showed sincere love for our films. Shaburamania, a famous film director from Madras, said: "New China's films have given me wisdom, and I have been deeply moved in my heart. We must learn from New China." The Indian government also highly praised Chinese films. Among the ten films from various countries selected for the disaster relief screening hosted by the Indian government in Calcutta, three of our films, "Steel Fighter," "The White Haired Girl," and "Radiance," were selected. The workers in Calcutta showed great interest in Chinese films, saying: "New China's films are our own films." Indian young intellectuals developed deep feelings for the heroic figures depicted in our films. A college student in Madras said to us: "Steel Fighter is absolutely good, and everyone has a better impression of the actor who played Xiao Liu. I admire him very much. Please tell him when you go back that the people of Madras admire him very much." Citizens in several major cities were not only interested in the story of "The White Haired Girl," but were also moved by "Steel Fighter." A gentleman from the Delhi Citizens Association said after watching the film: "From this film, I saw how the Chinese people struggled and how they were liberated. I was really moved." Overseas Chinese in India were extremely concerned about the films of their motherland. They brought the old and the young from far away to the cinema. After watching the films, they all said in unison: "Our motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, is truly very different from before. It is truly an honor to be a Chinese now."
    Why do Indian audiences like Chinese films so much?
    Historical cultural exchanges have created a deep friendship between the two great nations of China and India. Bani Banerjee, a member of the India-China Friendship Association, said: "China and India are both in Asia and have lived in peace for thousands of years, so Indians have a special affection for China." More importantly, both China and India have suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time and have a common destiny. Today, every Indian looks at the great achievements of New China since its founding with amazement. Therefore, they are eager to increase their understanding of China through films, and our films happen to reflect the lives and struggles of our people, so they can satisfy their desires. At the mass rally of hundreds of thousands of people held in Madras by various mass organizations to welcome the delegations from China, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, the chairman said in his welcome speech: "In your country, you have made art serve the people, explain their lives, and express their happiness; but you are not limited to explanation, you have made art a life force, and the relationship between art and everyone is as inseparable as bread and air." This is precisely the opinion of millions of Indian audiences on our films.
    In short, our participation in the Indian International Film Festival this time is not only a good start for the exchange of film art between China and India, but more importantly, it has played a good role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between China and India. The chairman's speech at the mass rally in Madras reflected this fact. He said: "We urgently need to establish closer and deeper ties with you and learn more about you. In this way, we can establish a more familiar friendship, which we have never had the opportunity to get."
    We are very grateful to the Indian government for its hospitality during the film festival, and even more grateful to the Indian film industry, cultural circles, and the general audience for their help and care.

### 中国电影在印度受到热烈欢迎

    中国电影在印度受到热烈欢迎
    中央人民政府文化部电影局电影代表团
    印度国际电影节于一九五二年一月二十四日在孟买揭幕，于三月六日在加尔各答闭幕，共有二十三个国家的影片参加展览。其中派代表团参加电影节的则有中国、苏联、捷克、匈牙利、印度、巴基斯坦、埃及、意大利、法国、英国等十二国家。各国参加展览的影片，共计故事片及大纪录片（八千呎以上）六十二部，新闻纪录片六十三部。在印度国际电影节的影片展览中，最受观众欢迎的是中国和苏联的影片。捷克和匈牙利的影片也都得到了良好的反应。
    我国电影代表团是由吴印咸等六人组成的，带去影片四部。在电影节期间，以公映和招待形式，依次在孟买、马德拉斯、德里、加尔各答等四城市共映出五十四场（“白毛女”二十八场，“中国民族大团结”十一场，“钢铁战士”九场，“光芒万丈”六场），观众五万五千六百多人。
    “白毛女”受到了印度各界的普遍赞扬。“钢铁战士”得到了很高评价。当银幕上出现英雄们历受磨难而英勇不屈的场面时，观众都赋与英雄们以莫大的钦佩和同情，并且被英雄们感动得落了泪。当人民解放军大举反攻的镜头出现在观众面前时，他们则由衷地兴奋鼓舞，报以热烈的长时间不息的鼓掌。在“中国民族大团结”中每当毛主席出现时，观众都以热烈的掌声表示崇高的敬意。甚至在“光芒万丈”中银幕上出现毛主席的挂像时，观众也热烈地鼓掌。
    印度电影界的朋友们对我国的影片表现了真挚的热爱。马德拉斯的著名电影导演沙布拉马尼亚说：“新中国影片给了我以智慧，我的内心深处受到了感动，我们一定要向新中国学习。”印度政府对中国影片也十分赞许。在加尔各答由印度政府所主办的救灾映出选映之十部各国影片中，单是我国影片便被选映“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“光芒万丈”等三部。加尔各答的工人们对中国影片发生了浓厚的兴趣，他们说：“新中国影片是我们自己的影片。”印度的青年知识分子对于我国影片中所描述的英雄人物发生了深厚的感情。马德拉斯的一个大学生向我们说：“钢铁战士绝对的好，大家对扮演小刘的演员更有好感，我对他非常钦佩。请你们回去时告诉他，全马德拉斯的人对他都是非常钦佩的。”几个大城市中的市民，不仅对“白毛女”的故事感到兴趣，而且也受了“钢铁战士”的感动。德里公民协会的一位先生看了该片之后说：“从这部影片里，我看到中国人是怎样斗争过来的，怎样解放的，我真正地受了感动。”在印度的华侨，对祖国影片极度关怀，他们扶老携幼地从很远的地方到电影院来。看了影片之后，他们都异口同声地说：“我们的祖国，在毛主席领导下，真正比以前大不相同了，现在作一个中国人真是光荣。”
    为什么印度观众这样地喜欢中国影片呢？
    历史上的文化交流，缔造了中印两大民族的深厚的友谊。印中友好协会会员巴尼班那姬说：“中国和印度都在亚洲，和平相处数千年，所以印度人对中国特别有好感。”此外更重要的，是中国和印度都曾经长期受帝国主义压迫而有共同的命运。如今，每一个印度人都以惊奇的眼光望着新中国成立以来的伟大成就。因此，他们都渴望着从影片上来增加他们对于中国的了解，我们的影片恰好又正是反映了我国人民的生活和斗争，所以能够满足他们的渴望。在马德拉斯由各群众团体召开的十数万人的欢迎中、苏、匈、捷等国代表团的群众大会上，主席在欢迎词中说：“在你们的国家，你们已经使艺术服务于人民，解说他们的生活，表现他们的愉快；但你们不仅限于解说，你们已经使艺术成为一种生命的力量，艺术和每个人的关系已经是像面包和空气似的不可分离。”这正是代表千百万印度观众对我国影片的意见。
    总之，这次我们参加印度国际电影节，不仅在中印两国电影艺术交流上是一个良好的开端，而且更重要的是在增进中印两国的互相了解和友谊上起了良好的作用。在马德拉斯的群众大会上，主席的讲话便反映了这一事实。他说：“我们迫切地需要和你们建立更紧密更深厚的联系，要更多地了解你们。借此，我们可以建立起更熟识的友谊，这种时机我们是一向得不到的。”
    我们非常感谢在电影节期间印度政府对我们的招待，更感谢印度电影界、文化界以及广大观众对我们的帮助和关怀。
