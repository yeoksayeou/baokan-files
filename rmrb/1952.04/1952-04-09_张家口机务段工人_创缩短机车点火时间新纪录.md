    Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Workers
    Create New Record for Shortening Locomotive Ignition Time
    To the Editor: Workers at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot have created a new record for shortening ignition time. In order to promptly take over locomotives and reduce depot dwell time, ignition workers have continued to improve upon the advanced ignition methods of the Harbin and Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depots. As a result, they have reduced the ignition time from the bureau-stipulated six hours to three hours. However, this ignition method is very complicated and requires thorough preparation beforehand, but the ignition workers only have three people per shift, making it too much to handle. Last December, they explored a more convenient ignition method. They conducted experiments on one locomotive and further shortened the ignition time to one hour and thirty minutes, with the steam pressure reaching ten characters, three times higher than the bureau-stipulated standard. Recently, thanks to the victory of the "anti-corruption campaign," their production enthusiasm is even higher. On March 10th, they continued to use this method and created a record of one hour and five minutes for ignition time, with the steam pressure reaching the highest record of ten characters.

    张家口机务段工人
    创缩短机车点火时间新纪录
    编辑同志：张家口机务段工人创造了缩短点火时间的新纪录。为了及时接替机车，缩短在库停留时间，点火工人根据哈尔滨、石家庄机务段的先进点火法，继续加以改进，结果，把点火时间从局定六小时缩为三小时。但这种点火方法很繁杂，事先必须进行充分的准备，而点火工人每班只有三人，实在顾不过来。去年十二月，他们摸索出了更便利的点火法，他们在一台机车上进行试验，又把点火时间缩短到一点三十分，汽压达到十个字，比局定标准提高了三倍。最近，由于打“虎”的胜利，他们的生产热情更高了。三月十日，他们继续使用这个方法，创造了点火时间一点零五分，汽压达到十个字的最高纪录。                  朱亮　兰英
