Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st, TASS dispatch: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued the following statement regarding the US use of bacteriological weapons:

"The Executive Committee of the Communist Party, in view of the recent use of bacteriological weapons by the US military authorities in North Korea and within Chinese territory, spreading plague, typhus, cholera, and other diseases, issues the following statement expressing the anger and hatred felt by all good people towards this criminal atrocity.

These irrefutable facts have not only been confirmed by Korean and Chinese medical and military experts and the authoritative delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, but also by photographs published in the 'Daily Worker' on March 29th. The clumsy attempts by the US authorities to deny their crimes and to prevent the United Nations Disarmament Commission from discussing these crimes are reminiscent of Mussolini's attempts to deny accusations that he used poison gas during the war against Abyssinia; but Mussolini was eventually forced to admit his crimes.

The fact is that among the major powers, only the United States has consistently refused to ratify the treaty banning bacteriological warfare; Truman openly prevented the ratification of this treaty; the highest US military authorities openly boast about the development of their bacteriological weapons; and Truman recently said that he was considering using all kinds of weapons against Korea and China.

This barbaric act of conducting bacteriological warfare, in its cruelty, even surpasses the previous atrocities of napalm bombing, large-scale destruction, and the slaughter of civilians, women, and children. It is an act that endangers world civilization. The use of such weapons demonstrates the military bankruptcy of the US aggression against the Korean people and also demonstrates the US intention to undermine the armistice negotiations.

The Communist Party calls on all men and women, the entire working class, and all democratic groups to condemn this crime against humanity and violation of international law, and to redouble efforts to demand an immediate end to the Korean War and the immediate withdrawal of all British troops from Korea."

Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, April 1st, TASS dispatch: The General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, Ghosh, issued an appeal to the Indian people, calling on them to hold rallies and demonstrations across the country on April 6th to demand an immediate halt to the use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean people by the US imperialists.

Ghosh also called on the Indian people at the rallies to condemn the aggression by the French imperialists in Tunisia and to demand that the Indian government insist on the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia.

    英共发表声明抗议美国使用细菌武器
    号召英国人民要求撤退侵朝英军
    印共总书记号召印度人民举行抗议示威
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦一日讯：英国共产党执行委员会就美国使用细菌武器一事，发表声明如下：
    “共产党执行委员会鉴于朝鲜美军当局最近在朝鲜北部和中国境内使用细菌武器，散布鼠疫、伤寒、霍乱及其他疾病，特发表声明，对于这种罪恶暴行，表示一切善良的人民所感到的愤怒和憎恨。
    这些无可辩驳的事实不仅已由朝中医务专家与军事专家和国际民主法律工作者协会的权威代表团予以证实，而且‘工人日报’已于三月二十九日刊登照片，予以证实了。美国当局想否认他们的罪行并禁止联合国裁减军备委员会讨论这种罪行的笨拙企图，正和墨索里尼企图否认人家控诉他在对阿比西尼亚进行战争时使用毒气一事，如出一辙；但墨索里尼后来终于不得不承认了他的罪行。
    事实是：在大国中间，只有美国一贯拒绝批准禁止细菌战的条约；杜鲁门曾公然阻止批准这个条约；美国最高军事当局公开吹嘘他们的细菌武器的发展；杜鲁门最近曾说：他正在考虑对朝鲜和中国使用各种式样的武器。
    进行细菌战这种野蛮行为，在残酷程度上，甚至超过以前的凝固汽油弹轰炸、大规模破坏、屠杀平民、妇女和儿童等暴行。这是危害全世界文明的行为。使用这种武器说明了美国侵略朝鲜人民在军事上已告破产，也说明了美国蓄意要破坏停战谈判。
    共产党号召一切男女、全体工人阶级和各民主团体谴责这种危害人类、违反国际法的罪行，并加倍努力要求立即停止朝鲜战争、立即把所有的英国军队撤出朝鲜。”
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社德里一日讯：印度共产党总书记高士发表了一篇告印度人民书，号召他们在四月六日在全国各地举行大会和示威，以要求立刻制止美帝国主义者对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器。
    高士同时还号召印度人民在大会上斥责法帝国主义者在突尼斯进行的侵略，并要求印度政府坚持要法国军队从突尼斯撤退。
