To provide a solid guarantee for this year's grain production increase plan:
    Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative Establishes Pig Raising Plan
    Northeast Regions Organize City Manure to Go to the Countryside to Solve the Fertilizer Shortage in Rural Areas

    The Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative has formulated a pig-raising plan. Every family in the cooperative will raise pigs, build pens to accumulate fertilizer, and provide a solid guarantee for this year's bumper harvest plan to increase grain production by 53 jin per mu.
    Li Shunda, having seen the Central People's Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural production for 1952, understood that raising pigs was the most effective way to accumulate fertilizer, so he launched a discussion among the cooperative members. At the beginning of the discussion, everyone was afraid that too many pigs would damage crops, that swine fever would occur, and that women would be too busy, but after everyone calculated that the fertilizer accumulated by one pig in a year was equivalent to 500 jin of bean cake, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for raising pigs increased. Later, after discussions in each family, the entire cooperative passed the 1952 plan to increase pigs, repair pens, and accumulate fertilizer. The plan stipulates: 1. The cooperative will establish a pig-raising team, increase the purchase of two sows, one boar, and two fattening pigs to breed 14 piglets. In addition, each household will raise 15 pigs, for a total of 34 pigs, and build 10 pig pens. 2. Based on the calculation of 20 large pigs, it is required to accumulate 8,000 dan of pig manure throughout the year, so that the cooperative's 159 mu of land will be fertilized with an average of 50 dan of fertilizer per mu. 3. The cooperative will assign two and a half laborers to specialize in raising pigs, repairing pens, turning fertilizer, and herding pigs. In addition to household chores, women are responsible for feeding the pigs well. 4. Utilize hillside land to plant 10 mu of alfalfa as supplementary feed for raising pigs. Now the Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative has begun to buy pigs and actively repair pens. They will also drive the farmers in the entire Xigou village to formulate pig-raising plans and carry out a pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation competition. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Many areas in Northeast China are vigorously organizing city manure to go to the countryside to solve the fertilizer shortage in rural areas.

    This year, farmers in various regions, in order to increase the yield per unit area of farmland, generally feel that there is a shortage of fertilizer. To this end, all regions are paying attention to organizing city manure to go to the countryside. Lishu, Xinmin, Zhangwu and other counties in Liaoxi Province conducted a survey of town manure in February. Currently, Lishu County's sixth district and Zhangwu County's first district alone have transported enough manure from the towns to fertilize more than 6,800 mu of cultivated land. Farmers near the urban area of ​​Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, dispatch a large number of vehicles to the city every day to transport manure, and have now transported back more than 3.5 million jin. In order to provide the town's accumulated manure to the countryside in a timely manner for application, Shulan County, Jilin Province, specially convened a meeting of the owners of the large cart shops with the most accumulated manure in the urban area, mobilizing them to sell the accumulated manure fairly to the farmers, and correcting their speculative thinking of "raising the price of manure when the countryside is short of manure." Now the accumulated manure of these large cart shops has all been sold to the farmers.

    The organization of city manure to go to the countryside in various places is mostly combined with urban sanitation work. For example, when the People's Government of Acheng County, Songjiang Province, led the people in the urban area to carry out spring epidemic prevention work, it specially convened a meeting with the participation of cadres from agencies and representatives of residents to mobilize them to clean up toilets and garbage dumps and help farmers transport manure. After the meeting, various agencies and streets launched a cleanup campaign to help farmers transport more than 8,000 carts of manure to the countryside. Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, also established a sanitation company to specialize in organizing city manure to go to the countryside. (Xinhua News Agency)

    为今年的粮食增产计划提供切实保证
    李顺达农业生产合作社订出养猪计划
    东北各地组织城粪下乡解决农村肥料不足的困难
    李顺达农业生产合作社订出了一个养猪的计划。全社家家都要养猪，修圈积肥，给今年每亩增产五十三斤粮食的丰产计划提供切实保证。
    李顺达看到中央人民政府政务院颁布的关于一九五二年农业生产的决定，明白了养猪是积肥最有效的办法，就发动社员讨论。开始讨论时大家怕猪多了糟踏庄稼，怕发生猪瘟，怕妇女们忙不过来等，可是当大家算出一口猪在一年内所能积存的肥料等于五百斤豆饼后，社员们的养猪热情就高了。后来又经各家庭开会讨论，最后全社便通过了一九五二年增猪修圈积肥的计划。计划规定：一、社内成立养猪小组，增购母猪二只、公猪一只、菜猪二只，繁殖小猪十四只，另外，各户养十五只，以上共养猪三十四只，垒猪圈十个。二、按二十个大猪计算，要求全年积猪肥八千担，使全社一百五十九亩地，平均每亩增施肥料五十担。三、社内确定两个半劳力专门养猪、修圈、翻肥、放猪。妇女除做家庭生活外，负责把猪喂好。四、利用坡地种十亩苜蓿，作为养猪补助饲料。现在李顺达农业生产合作社已开始买猪和积极修圈。他们还要带动西沟全村农民订出养猪计划，开展养猪积肥的竞赛。    （新华社）
    东北许多地区正大力组织城粪下乡，解决农村肥料不足的困难。
    今年各地农民为了提高农田单位面积产量，普遍感到肥料不足。为此，各地都很注意组织城粪下乡。辽西省梨树、新民、彰武等县，曾在二月间调查了城镇积粪，现仅梨树县六区和彰武县一区，从城镇运回的粪肥已够六千八百多亩耕地施用。辽东省海城县城区附近的农民，每天都出动大批车辆进城运粪，现已运回三百五十多万斤。吉林省舒兰县为把城镇积粪及时供给农村施用，曾专门召集城区积粪最多的大车店主开会，动员他们把积粪公平地卖给农民，纠正了这些人“趁农村缺粪抬高粪价”的投机思想。现在这些大车店的积粪已全部卖给了农民。
    各地组织城粪下乡大都和城市卫生工作结合进行。如松江省阿城县人民政府在领导城区人民进行春季防疫工作时，就专门召开了有机关干部和居民代表参加的会议，动员他们清除厕所和垃圾堆，帮助农民运粪。会后，各机关，各街道都展开了清除运动，帮助农民把八千多车粪运下了乡。辽西省新民县还成立了一个卫生公司，专门组织城粪下乡。        （新华社）
