Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 24th: Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agent elements, dispatched by the U.S. aggressors to prisoner-of-war camps to engage in conspiracies, are using all kinds of barbaric and shameless methods to insult and persecute our captured personnel. They are attempting to use these brutal methods, which violate international conventions and are intolerable to humanity, to create conditions for the malicious plan of forcibly detaining our captured personnel in order to hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

To persecute our captured personnel, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang long ago transferred a large number of secret agent elements from Taiwan to serve as so-called "instructors" in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. They forcibly subjected our captured personnel to fascist education, and those who refused to "receive training" suffered barbaric beatings and persecution. A United Press dispatch from Geoje Island on January 20th admitted: Our captured soldiers are often forced "to listen to 'propaganda and education' reports from American officers or Chinese Nationalist instructors."

The crimes committed by Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements under the direct command of the U.S. aggressors are too numerous to recount. Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements presided over the organization of reactionary organizations such as the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," the "Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Alliance," and the "Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," coercing our captured personnel to participate. Particularly outrageous is that Chiang Kai-shek secret agents inhumanely and brutally tattooed our captured personnel. According to a United Press dispatch from Geoje Island on January 20th: "Throughout the prisoner-of-war camp, one can see prisoners with tattoos on their bodies. Most of the tattoos are anti-communist slogans." "The most common are the Chinese characters for 'Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian', and sometimes there are also the English characters for 'Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian'." At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements shamelessly drafted petitions demanding "voluntary repatriation," forcing our captured personnel to sign these letters, which violated their personal will, in blood. According to the confessions of U.S. paratrooper secret agent Li Xingshun and others, our captured personnel who expressed unwillingness to accept such insults and injuries were beaten, hung upside down, shot, or secretly executed by the U.S. side. After the prisoners were forcibly tattooed, officers in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp spread absurd rumors, threatening our captured personnel saying: "If they fall into the hands of the Communist army again, they will surely only meet their death," (United Press dispatch January 20th) thereby threatening our victims, preventing them from requesting to return to our side. The U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang vainly attempts to use these cruel and utterly shameless means to violate the desire of our captured personnel to return to their motherland, to realize their malicious conspiracy of forcibly detaining our captured personnel under the guise of "voluntary repatriation," so as to transfer our captured personnel to the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang in Taiwan for persecution and slaughter. This is the inside story of the "voluntary repatriation" trick played by the U.S. side at the negotiating table.

However, despite this series of criminal activities by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they still cannot force our captured personnel to submit and accept their so-called "voluntary repatriation" absurd principle. Even the U.S. aggressors themselves have no confidence in the effects of their criminal activities. A United Press reporter, in a dispatch from the U.S. side's first prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island on January 21st, said, referring to the fact that several thousand Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel were forced to tattoo anti-communist slogans on their bodies: "But officials say there is no way to estimate whether these people are sincere or not." Moran, the person in charge of the prisoner-of-war camp, was even more distressed and said: "You can only split their heads open to know what they are thinking. How can you tell what they really want?" A reporter for the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" also admitted, when commenting on the U.S. side's plan to forcibly educate our captured personnel on December 1st of last year: "It seems that most people have not been moved." From this, people can fully see that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" of "respecting the individual free will of prisoners" is a complete and utter shameful fraud.

Our side is fully aware of the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to use despicable methods such as tattooing and writing blood letters to force our captured personnel to dare not express their desire to return to their motherland. The recent statements issued by the spokesman of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have clearly pointed out: Our reasonable proposition that both sides should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by each side after the cessation of active hostilities "will never be changed because some of our captured personnel had tattoos on their arms, or wrote certain documents, or performed other similar acts during their detention. We know very well that these actions were never voluntary on their part, and they should not be held responsible. We fully welcome all our captured personnel to return to the embrace of the motherland." The Korean people and the Chinese people unanimously and sincerely support this statement. The shameful atrocities imposed on our captured personnel by the U.S. aggressors and their pawns, the Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements, can only arouse the angry protests and severe condemnation of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world.

    美国指使蒋匪特务残暴迫害我被俘人员
    中朝人民对美国无耻暴行表示愤怒抗议
    【新华社开城二十四日电】被美国侵略者派在战俘营中从事阴谋活动的蒋匪特务分子，使用种种野蛮而无耻的方法侮辱和迫害我方被俘人员。他们妄图利用这些违反国际公约和为人类所不能容忍的残暴方法，为强迫扣留我方被俘人员以便送交蒋介石匪帮的恶毒计划，制造条件。
    美蒋匪帮为了迫害我方被俘人员，早就从台湾调来了大批特务分子，在美方战俘营充当所谓“教官”，对我方被俘人员强制实行法西斯教育，我方被俘人员不愿“受训”就要遭受野蛮的殴打和迫害。合众社巨济岛一月二十日电承认：我方战俘常被强迫“去听美国军官或中国国民党教官的‘宣传和教育’的报告”。
    蒋匪特务分子在美国侵略者的直接指挥下所干的罪行，是罄竹难书的。蒋匪特务主持组织了“反共救国团”、“反共抗俄同盟”、“青年反共救国团”之类的反动组织，胁迫我方被俘人员参加。尤其令人发指的，蒋匪特务还残暴不仁和毫无人性地在我方被俘人员身上刺字。据合众社巨济岛一月二十日电透露：“俘虏营内到处可以看见身上刺字的俘虏，大多数的刺字都是反共的口号。”“最常见的是中文的‘反共抗俄’的字句，有时也有英文的
    ‘反共抗俄’的字句。”同时，蒋匪特务并无耻地起草要求“自愿遣返”的请愿书，强迫我方被俘人员用血在这些违反他们个人意志的书信上签名。根据美方空降特务李兴顺等的供词，我方被俘人员如表示不愿接受这种侮辱和伤害，即被美方毒打，倒吊，枪杀或秘密处死。而在俘虏被强迫刺字之后，美方战俘营的军官又大肆散布无稽谰言，恫吓我方被俘人员说：“如果他们再落入共军手中，他们一定只有死路一条了，”（合众社一月二十日电）以此来威胁我方受害人员，不敢再要求回到我方。美蒋匪帮妄想利用这些残忍和无耻透顶的手段，强奸我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的意愿，实现其在“自愿遣返”名义下强迫扣留我方被俘人员的恶毒阴谋，以便把我方被俘人员转送给台湾国民党残余匪帮，供其进行迫害和屠杀。这就是美方在谈判桌上所玩弄的“自愿遣返”把戏的内幕。
    但是，尽管美蒋匪帮进行了这一系列的罪恶活动，他们依然不能强使我方被俘人员屈服，接受其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，甚至美国侵略者自己对他们的罪恶活动的效果，也没有信心。合众社记者一月二十一日从巨济岛美方第一俘虏营发出的消息在谈到有好几千中国人民志愿军被俘人员被强迫在身上刺了反共口号时说：“但是官员们说，没有办法估计这些人是不是诚心诚意的。”该俘虏营的负责人摩兰更是苦恼不堪地说：“你只有把他们的头劈开，才能知道他们是怎样想的。你怎能说出他们真正希望什么呢？”美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者在去年十二月一日评论美方对我方被俘人员进行强迫教育的计划时也承认：“看来，大多数人都没有受到感动。”人们从这里完全可以看出：所谓“尊重俘虏个人自由意志”的“自愿遣返”是一个彻头彻尾的可耻的骗局。
    我方对于美国侵略者企图利用刺字和写血书之类的卑鄙方法迫使我方被俘人员不敢再表示他们要求回归祖国的愿望的阴谋，是洞悉其奸的。朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人最近奉命发表的声明，已经明确地指出：我方对于在积极的敌对行为停止后交战双方应迅速释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘的合理主张，“绝不因我方被俘人员在拘留期间，曾有一部分人在臂上刺字，或写下某种文件，或作其他类似的行为而有所改变。我们深知这些行为绝非出于他们的自愿，不应由他们负责。我们完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国的怀抱”。朝鲜人民和中国人民一致衷心拥护这一声明。美国侵略者及其爪牙蒋匪特务分子强加于我方被俘人员身上的可耻暴行，只能激起朝中人民和世界人民的愤怒抗议和严厉斥责。
