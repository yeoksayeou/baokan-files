Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Moscow legal workers held a city-wide rally on April 22nd to protest against the American imperialists' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    Stepanov, Chairman of the Moscow Legal Workers Association, presided over the meeting. He began by saying that the unprecedented crime in the history of war committed by the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people has aroused unparalleled indignation among the Soviet people. He pointed out that the recent meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers had determined that "the countries fighting in Korea under American command and the countries colluding with the United States through military agreements" should be responsible for these crimes. We Soviet legal workers cannot remain silent on the question of the responsibility of these countries' governments for these inhumane crimes or for their complicity in these crimes. We are deeply convinced that the people of the world will surely be able to demand punishment for these despicable crimes, which are mainly directed against peaceful residents.

    Speaking next, Borovik said: Today, the whole world knows very well that the heinous plan to use bacteriological weapons was prepared long ago by the war criminals in Washington. In their plans for aggression and plunder, these weapons were prepared to play a major role. The American cannibals have long cultivated cholera, plague and other deadly bacteria in their laboratories so that when the time comes, they can use these demonic means against peace-loving people who are unwilling to submit to Washington's will.

    Chernykh said at the meeting: We legal workers demand that anyone who uses heinous weapons prohibited by law and the customs of war must be tried as the most serious war criminal.

    Braude, a well-known Moscow legal worker, delivered an impassioned speech, condemning the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors in Korea and China as the most serious war crime. He said: Soviet legal workers, with knowledge and experience in distinguishing evidence, have carefully studied and analyzed the report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team. From this, we are deeply convinced that the evidence cited in this report is irrefutable, the facts have been established, and the shocking crimes of the American cannibals have been fully proven. Therefore, our conclusion is that we must contribute all our experience and all our knowledge to fight against the terrible threat posed to mankind by American imperialism. We know that the majority of mankind is united in fighting for peace and against war. We firmly believe that the wishes of the people will surely be realized. The guarantee of this is that the struggle for peace is led by the great Stalin.

    The conference passed a resolution, most strongly protesting the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors. The resolution pointed out that the meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers had very correctly determined that the crimes of the American imperialists were the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity.

    The resolution said: We Moscow legal workers support the letter to legal workers worldwide adopted by the meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and guarantee to contribute all our energy and knowledge to expose the wicked American aggressors to the end. We are deeply convinced that the people of the world will be able to take the necessary measures to subdue the American imperialists and their accomplices.

    莫斯科法律工作者抗议美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科法律工作者在四月二十二日举行全市性的集会，抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。
    莫斯科法律工作者协会主席斯捷潘诺夫主持会议。他首先发言说：美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国人民使用细菌武器这种战争史上空前的罪行，激起了苏联人民无比的愤怒。他指出，国际民主法律工作者协会理事会不久以前举行的会议已经确定，“在美国指挥下在朝鲜作战的各国以及用军事协定与美国勾结在一起的各国”，应该对这些罪行负责。关于这些国家的政府对这些违反人道的罪行或共谋参与这些罪行的责任问题，我们苏联法律工作者不能默不作声。我们深信，全世界人民一定能够要求惩办这些主要是对付和平居民的卑劣罪行。
    接着发言的波罗维克说：今天，全世界都已经清清楚楚地知道，使用细菌武器的万恶计划，是华盛顿的战犯们老早就准备的。在他们的侵略和掠夺计划中，这些武器准备要起重大的作用。美国吃人生番老早就在他们的实验室中培养霍乱、鼠疫和其他致命的病菌，以便时机一到，就对不愿向华盛顿的意旨屈服的爱好和平的人民使用这种恶魔般的手段。
    彻尔尼赫在会上说：我们法律工作者要求：任何使用为法律和战争惯例所禁止的万恶武器的人，都必须当作最严重的战争罪犯加以审判。
    莫斯科著名法律工作者布劳德发表了激动的演说，指责美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战是最严重的战争罪行。他说：具有判别证据的知识和经验的苏联法律工作者，仔细地研究并分析了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告。由此，我们深深相信，这个报告里所引述的证据是无可置辩的，事实已经确定，美国吃人生番的惊人罪行已经充分获得证明。因此，我们的结论是，我们必须贡献出我们的全部经验和全部知识，和美帝国主义者对人类的可怕威胁进行斗争。我们知道，人类的大多数都同心一致地要为争取和平、反对战争而奋斗。我们坚决相信人民的愿望一定能够实现。这一点的保证就是：争取和平的斗争是伟大的斯大林领导的。
    大会通过了一个决议，最坚决地抗议美国侵略者的滔天罪行。决议指出：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会的会议非常正确地确定了：美帝国主义者的罪行是最严重的战争罪行和违反人道的罪行。
    决议说：我们莫斯科法律工作者支持国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议通过的告全世界法律工作者书，保证贡献我们的全部精力和知识，坚持到底地揭露罪恶的美国侵略者。我们深信，全世界人民将能采取必要的措施来制服美帝国主义者及其同谋犯。
