	Letter Summary

	Hope for More News Documentaries
	Recently, our school showed the news documentary "The Army Marching to Liberate Tibet". We were deeply moved after watching it. The heroic People's Liberation Army, for the liberation of the Tibetan people, crossed mountains and rivers, built bridges in rapid currents, and built wide roads on steep cliffs. This indomitable spirit greatly inspires us.
	This kind of documentary is of great educational significance to us. Now, countless heroic deeds are constantly emerging across the country. The construction of the Huai River, the construction of windbreaks, and the emergence of collective farms are all the best subjects. We hope that more documentaries can be filmed.

	I think everyone should pay attention to news documentaries, because they are one of the best weapons for conducting current political education for the broad masses. With irrefutable facts, it enables the audience to have a comprehensive and profound understanding of the development of the real struggle and the people's lives, and encourages and educates the audience to actively participate in the struggle, love the motherland, love peace, and hate the enemy. The "Resist America, Aid Korea" documentary played such a role. Some people underestimate news documentaries, which is wrong and should be corrected.

    希望多摄制新闻记录片
    最近，我们学校放映了新闻记录片“解放西藏大军行”。我们看了，深受感动。英雄的人民解放军，为了西藏人民的解放，翻山涉水，在急流中架起了桥梁，在峻峭的危崖上修成了宽坦的大道，这种坚强不挠的精神，大大地鼓舞着我们。
    这种记录片给我们的教育意义很大。现在全国各地，无数轰轰烈烈的事迹，不断涌现出来，淮河的兴修，防风林的建造，集体农庄的出现等等，都是最好的题材，希望能够多多拍摄成记录片。

    我认为大家应该重视新闻记录影片，因为它是对广大群众进行时事政治教育的最好的武器之一。它以无可争辩的事实，使观众对现实斗争、人民生活的发展，有概括而深刻的了解，并鼓动和教育观众去积极参加斗争，热爱祖国，热爱和平，痛恨敌人。像“抗美援朝”记录片，就曾起了这样的作用。有些人轻视新闻记录片，这是错误的，应该加以纠正。                         顾华
