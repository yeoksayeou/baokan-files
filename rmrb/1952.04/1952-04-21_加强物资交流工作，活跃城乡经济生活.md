Strengthening Material Exchange to Revitalize Urban and Rural Economies
Li Zheren, Director of the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council

The North China Material Exchange Conference is about to be held in Tianjin. This is an important step in further strengthening North China's economic construction on the basis of the victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. It will greatly promote the organization of current urban and rural material exchange. Relevant economic departments in various regions should pay sufficient attention to it and actively participate.

The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles has brought many encouraging new developments to the North China economic front. The work enthusiasm of cadres in state organs and the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and staff in public and private enterprises have been greatly improved. Many mines and factories have overfulfilled their first-quarter production tasks while simultaneously "fighting tigers." State-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various regions have successively lowered the listed prices of many commodities, which has relatively increased the people's purchasing power and improved their living standards. After the transformation in the "Five-Anti" struggle, the vast majority of private industrialists and businessmen have realized that as long as they operate within the scope of the Common Program and the policies and decrees of the People's Government, they still have reasonable profits and prospects for development, thereby enhancing their business confidence. In short, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, North China's economic construction has begun to show a healthy and prosperous development trend.

However, in order to better leverage the positive effects of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and to meet the high tide of large-scale economic construction across the country, one problem must be quickly and thoroughly resolved in the North China economy: although economic departments in various regions of North China have strengthened their business operations since March and have achieved considerable results, there is still a large backlog of urban industrial products, and rural agricultural products urgently need to be sold. If this problem is not resolved quickly and thoroughly, it will be impossible to further revitalize the urban and rural economies. This problem is entirely solvable. Because, the current backlog of industrial products or agricultural products is not fundamentally a problem of no sales channels; the sales channels exist, the problem lies only in further strengthening the organization of promotion work. According to the rich experience of organizing material exchanges in various parts of the country in the past, the best way is to convene material exchange conferences and carry out urban and rural material exchanges. Therefore, the convening of this North China Material Exchange Conference is of great significance. The central task of the conference is clearly defined as vigorously organizing and promoting the exchange of agricultural products, promoting the sale of urban industrial products (mainly daily necessities) to the countryside, and at the same time, checking old contracts and signing new contracts. The proposal of these tasks is realistic, and we must seriously implement them.

In order to make this conference a success, the following matters should be noted in various parts of North China:

    First, trade delegations should be widely organized to participate in the conference transactions. To this end, it is recommended that the financial and economic committees, commercial departments, bureaus, and cooperatives of each province and city immediately organize small trade delegations from provinces, cities, province-administered cities, special districts, counties, and towns to quickly come to Tianjin to participate in the transaction. The members of these trade delegations should not only understand the local production and sales situation, be familiar with the current supply and marketing needs of farmers, but also understand the business and be able to take responsibility. Private merchants should also be selectively absorbed. Forming such trade delegations is the key to whether this conference can be successful. Because only when the trade delegation is widely representative will it be conducive to expanding the scope of material exchange.

    Second, we must overcome the one-sided view of only selling but not buying. According to the situation of the agricultural product exchange symposium recently convened by the North China District Company of the China Native Produce Company, the main ideological obstacle to carrying out material exchange at present is that all regions generally only want to sell goods and do not want to buy goods. The emergence of this idea is because everyone only looks at the problem from the perspective of their own commodity backlog and temporary lack of sufficient working capital. They do not understand that if everyone one-sidedly only sells but does not buy, it will inevitably make it impossible for everyone to do business well, so that materials in various regions cannot be exchanged, and the economy cannot become active. Therefore, the idea of only selling but not buying is a wrong idea that disregards the overall situation and violates the laws of transaction. We hope that all public and private units participating in the conference transactions can actively organize transactions in the spirit of buying and selling, buying and selling more, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit. In order to strive for a large number of transactions, various transaction methods can be adopted, such as spot goods and cash, spot goods and deferred payment, chain contracts, ordering futures, exchanging goods for goods, and consignment sales. Our past experience in carrying out material exchange fully proves that as long as we do this, even under the condition of temporary insufficient working capital, there are still many ways to organize transactions and do business well.

    Third, we must overcome high-price thinking. High-price thinking is wrong; because it hinders the timely sale of agricultural products, it will cause some agricultural products to miss the season or even rot, and the final result is passively selling them at reduced prices. High-price thinking does not truly represent the mass viewpoint of protecting the interests of farmers; on the contrary, it will make farmers suffer losses and dampen their production enthusiasm. The main problem at present is how to quickly sell the agricultural products that farmers urgently need to sell, and exchange them for the things they urgently need. High-price thinking does not meet the requirements of farmers. Because whether from the perspective of local interests or overall interests, it is better to sell than to rot, and it is better to circulate materials than to pile them up there. Of course, it is also wrong to unreasonably lower prices in order to take care of the interests of farmers.

In addition, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various provinces and cities in North China should also hold small-scale material exchange meetings with special districts or counties as units, in an organized and planned manner to promote mass short-distance material exchanges, so that the diverse and small-scale agricultural products in the hands of farmers can be sold to increase farmers' income and increase their purchasing power.

We believe that under the leadership of the Government Administration Council's North China Administrative Committee and the joint efforts of the people's governments of various provinces and cities in North China, the conference will surely be able to successfully complete its tasks.

    加强物资交流工作，活跃城乡经济生活
    政务院华北行政委员会贸易局局长  李哲人
    华北区物资交流大会即将在天津举行，这是在“三反”“五反”胜利的基础上进一步加强华北经济建设的一个重要步骤；它对组织当前城乡物资交流，将会起很大的推动作用。各地有关的经济部门应予以足够重视，并踊跃参加。
    “三反”“五反”斗争的胜利，使得华北经济战线上出现了许多令人鼓舞的新气象。国家机关干部的工作积极性和各公私营企业广大职工的生产积极性，大大地提高了。不少矿山、工厂，在一面“打虎”、一面生产的情况下，超额完成了第一季度的生产任务。各地国营贸易部门和合作社，很多种商品的牌价已先后降低，这就相对地提高了人民的购买力和改善了人民的生活。私营工商业者经过了“五反”斗争中的改造，绝大部分认识到只要在共同纲领和人民政府的政策、法令范围内去经营，仍有合理的利润和发展的前途，从而也就提高了经营信心。总之，经过了“三反”“五反”运动，华北经济建设事业已开始显露着健康的欣欣向荣的发展趋势。
    但是，为了更好地进一步发挥“三反”“五反”运动的积极作用，迎接全国大规模经济建设的高潮，目前华北经济上必须迅速彻底地解决一个问题，即虽然三月以来华北各地经济部门已加强了业务工作，并已取得了相当成绩，但城市工业品仍有很多积压，农村土产也亟待销售。这一问题如不迅速彻底解决，就不可能进一步活跃城乡经济。这一问题是完全能够解决的。因为，当前无论工业品或土产的积压，都不是根本没有销路的问题；销路是有的，问题只在于进一步加强组织推销的工作。根据全国各地以往组织物资交流的丰富的经验，最好的办法就是召开物资交流大会，开展城乡物资交流。因此，这次华北区物资交流大会的召开，就有着很大的意义。大会的中心任务明确地规定为大力组织和推动土产交流、推销城市工业品（主要是日用百货）下乡，同时检查旧合同，订立新合同。这些任务的提出是切合实际的，我们必须认真地把它实现。
    为了开好这次大会，目前华北各地应注意以下几件事情：
    一、要广泛地组织贸易代表团参加大会交易。为此，建议各省市财经委员会、商业厅、局、合作社立即组织省、市、省属市、专区、县、镇的小型贸易团，迅速来天津参加交易。这些贸易团的成员应是既了解当地产销情况、熟悉农民当前供销需要，又懂得业务和能负责作主的，并应有选择地吸收私商参加。组成这样的贸易团是这次大会能不能开好的关键所在。因为只有贸易团的代表性是广泛的，才有利于扩大物资交流的范围。
    二、必须克服只卖不买的片面观点。根据最近中国土产公司华北区公司召开的土产交流座谈会的情况，目前开展物资交流的主要思想障碍是各地普遍只想卖货，不想买货。这种思想的产生是因为大家都只从自己商品积压流动资金暂时不大充裕，这一点来看问题。他们不了解，如果大家都片面地只卖不买，势必使得大家都做不好买卖，从而各地物资便不能交流起来，经济就不可能转向活跃。因此，只卖不买的思想是一种不顾全局的违反交易规律的错误思想。我们希望所有参加大会交易的公私单位，都能本着有买有卖、多买多卖、互助互利的精神，积极组织成交。为了争取大量成交，可采取多种多样的交易方式，如现货现款、现货期款、连环合同、定购期货、以货换货、委托代销等。过去我们开展物资交流的经验充分地证明：只要这样做，即便在流动资金暂时不大充裕的条件下，组织成交、作好买卖的办法仍然是很多的。
    三、必须克服高价思想。高价思想是错误的；因为它妨害土产及时销售，会使得某些土产错过季节甚至霉烂，而最后结果却是被动地降价出卖。高价思想并不是真正代表农民利益的群众观点；相反地，会使农民吃亏，并打击农民生产情绪。当前主要的问题是如何迅速地把农民亟需销出的土产销出，并换回他们迫切需要的东西。高价思想是不符合农民要求的。因为不论从局部利益或整体利益来看，卖掉总比烂掉好，物资周转起来总比死堆在那里好。当然，为了照顾农民利益，不合理地把价格压低，也是不对的。
    此外，华北各省市国营贸易部门、合作社还应以专区或县为单位，举行小型的物资交流会议，有组织地有计划地推动群众性的短距离的物资交流，把农民手中的种类繁多的零星的小宗土产都能卖出去，以增加农民收入，提高他们的购买力。
    我们相信，在政务院华北行政委员会的领导和华北各省市人民政府共同努力下，大会一定能够圆满地完成它的任务。
