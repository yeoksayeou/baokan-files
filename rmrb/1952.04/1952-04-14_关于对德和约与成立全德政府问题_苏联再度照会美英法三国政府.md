Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th: TASS reports: On March 25th of this year, Mr. Corning, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the United States, Mr. Grey, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the United Kingdom, and Mr. Brionval, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of France, each delivered to Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky an identical note from their respective governments, responding to the Soviet government's note of March 10th of this year regarding a German peace treaty.

On April 9th of this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky received French Ambassador Chataigneau, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Corning, and British Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Grey, and delivered to them the Soviet government's reply.

The following is the full text of the U.S. government's note of March 25, 1952, and the Soviet government's reply of April 9, 1952.

U.S. Government Note of March 25, 1952

The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim presents his compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and, upon instructions from his government, transmits the following note:

The U.S. government, in consultation with the governments of the United Kingdom and France, has given the most careful consideration to the Soviet government's note of March 10, 1952, concerning the proposal to conclude a German peace treaty. The U.S. government has also consulted with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and representatives in Berlin.

The conclusion of a just and lasting peace treaty ending the division of Germany has been and remains a fundamental objective of the U.S. government. As the Soviet government itself recognizes, the conclusion of such a treaty requires the establishment of an all-German government representing the will of the German people. Such a government can only be established on the basis of free elections held in the Federal Republic, the Soviet Zone of Occupation, and Berlin. Such elections can only be held under conditions which ensure the national and individual freedom of the German people. In order to determine whether this primary and fundamental condition exists, the United Nations General Assembly has appointed a commission to conduct simultaneous investigations in the Federal Republic, the Soviet Zone of Occupation, and Berlin. This Commission has received assurances of the necessary facilities for its activities in the Federal Republic and West Berlin. The U.S. government would be pleased if such facilities were also provided in the Soviet Zone of Occupation and East Berlin, enabling the Commission to fulfill its task.

The Soviet government's note does not indicate the international status of the all-German government pending the conclusion of a peace treaty. The U.S. government considers that, both before and after the conclusion of a peace treaty, the all-German government should be free to join alliances consistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations.

In presenting its proposal for a German peace treaty, the Soviet government has also expressed its willingness to discuss other proposals. The U.S. government has taken due note of this statement. The U.S. government considers that detailed discussions of a peace treaty are impossible until the conditions for free elections have been created and a free all-German government capable of participating in discussions of a peace treaty has been formed. Furthermore, there are a number of fundamental issues that need to be resolved.

For example, the U.S. government notes that the Soviet government states that the territory of Germany should be limited to the borders stipulated in the Potsdam Conference resolutions. The U.S. government wishes to point out that, in fact, the Potsdam resolutions did not define specific German borders, and that the Potsdam resolutions explicitly stipulated that territorial issues should be finally decided at the time of the peace treaty.

The U.S. government also observes that the Soviet government now believes that the peace treaty should stipulate that Germany should establish national land, sea, and air forces, while at the same time restricting Germany's freedom to form alliances with other countries. The U.S. government considers these provisions to be a step backward and likely to impede the emergence in Europe of a new era of international relations based on cooperation rather than hostility and mutual distrust. The U.S. government is deeply convinced of the need for a policy of European unification, and it is therefore giving its full support to plans that would enable Germany to participate in a purely defensive European community; this European community would uphold freedom, prevent aggression, and preclude the possibility of a revival of militarism. The U.S. government believes that the Soviet government's proposal that Germany can establish national armed forces is inconsistent with the attainment of this goal. The U.S. government remains convinced that this policy of European unification threatens the interests of no country and is the true path to peace.

Soviet Government Note of April 9, 1952

“Regarding the U.S. government's note of March 25th of this year, the Soviet government deems it necessary to make the following statement.

In its note of March 10th, the Soviet government proposed to the U.S. government, the British government, and the French government that discussions on a German peace treaty should commence without delay, so that a mutually agreed draft treaty could be prepared in the near future. In order to facilitate the drafting of the treaty, the Soviet government submitted a draft of the principles for a German peace treaty, and also expressed its willingness to discuss any other proposals.

The Soviet government proposed that the treaty be drafted with the direct participation of an all-German government representing all of Germany.

The March 10th note also stipulated that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, exercising occupying powers in Germany, should study the conditions conducive to the early establishment of an all-German government expressing the will of the German people.

The Soviet government put forward these proposals regarding a German peace treaty and the establishment of an all-German government based on the fact that resolving these fundamental issues is extremely important for strengthening peace in Europe, and that it meets the necessary condition of adopting a fair attitude towards the legitimate national interests of the German people.

The urgent conclusion of a German peace treaty makes it necessary for the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to take urgent measures to unify Germany and establish an all-German government. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France must, as the Soviet government has previously suggested, discuss the issue of holding free all-German elections without delay. The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France all recognize the need to hold free all-German elections, thereby creating all the possibilities for holding such elections in the near future.

As for the suggestion that a United Nations commission investigate whether conditions exist for holding such elections for the upcoming free all-German elections, that is in conflict with the United Nations Charter, Article 107 of which stipulates that the United Nations shall not interfere in German affairs. Such an investigation can be carried out by an investigation team composed of the four powers exercising occupying powers in Germany.

The U.S. government has had the opportunity to study the draft principles for a German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government. However, the U.S. government has neither expressed its agreement to begin discussing this draft nor submitted its own draft treaty.

At the same time, the U.S. government has raised a number of objections to individual items in the Soviet-proposed draft principles for a German peace treaty, forcing the two governments to exchange notes again and delaying the resolution of contentious issues that could have been avoided through direct international discussions. However, since the United States raised a number of such issues in its note of March 25th, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to provide a detailed explanation of them.

The Soviet draft principles for a German peace treaty state: ‘Germany must guarantee that it will not participate in any group or military alliance aimed at opposing any country that participated in the war against Germany with its own troops.’

The Soviet government believes that such a suggestion is in line with the interests of the countries performing occupation duties in Germany, as well as the interests of Germany's neighbors, while also being in line with the interests of Germany itself as a peace-loving and democratic country. There is nothing intolerably restrictive of Germany's sovereignty in this suggestion. However, this suggestion makes it impossible for Germany to participate in any group of countries aimed at confronting any peace-loving country.

The Soviet draft principles for a German peace treaty state: ‘Germany may retain its own armed forces (army, navy, and air force) for self-defense.’

Everyone knows that the Soviet government also put forward the same suggestion in the draft peace treaty with Japan. Such a suggestion is in line with the principles of national sovereignty and equality of nations. It is simply inconceivable that Japan has the right to establish its own armed forces for self-defense purposes, while Germany is deprived of this right and placed in an inferior position. There is no doubt that such defensive military forces should be established for the cause of peace, for the German nation, and that instead of building revanchist mercenary armies in West Germany led by fascist Hitler generals, who want to plunge Europe into the abyss of a third world war.

As for the issue of Germany's borders, the Soviet government believes that the decisions made in this regard by the U.S., Soviet, and British governments at the Potsdam Conference, which France later joined, are sufficient and can serve as the final decision.

The Soviet government once again suggests to the U.S. government that it immediately work together with the British and French governments to study the issues of a German peace treaty, the unification of Germany, and the establishment of an all-German government. The Soviet government believes that these issues must be resolved and that there is no reason to delay them any further.

Will Germany be restored as a unified, independent, and peace-loving country, becoming a member of the peace-loving peoples of Europe; or will it continue to remain divided, thereby continuing to threaten all of Europe with war? This is the question we must decide at present.

The Soviet government has simultaneously sent two identical notes to the British and French governments respectively.”

Messrs. Chataigneau, Corning, and Grey said that they would forward the above notes to their respective governments.

    关于对德和约与成立全德政府问题
    苏联再度照会美英法三国政府
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：本年三月二十五日，美国临时代办柯明先生、英国临时代办格雷先生和法国临时代办布列翁瓦先生各将他们本国政府彼此相同的照会一件交给苏联外交部长维辛斯基，答复苏联政府本年三月十日关于对德和约的照会。
    本年四月九日，苏联外交部长维辛斯基接见法国大使夏戴纽先生、美国临时代办柯明先生及英国临时代办格雷先生，将苏联政府的复文交给他们。
    以下为美国政府一九五二年三月二十五日的照会以及苏联政府一九五二年四月九日的复文全文。
    美国政府一九五二年三月二十五日的照会
    美利坚合众国临时代办谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长致意，并奉本国政府的指示，转达下列照会：
    美国政府与联合王国及法国政府相商，最慎重地考虑了苏联政府一九五二年三月十日关于建议缔结对德和约的照会。美国政府并曾与德意志联邦共和国政府及柏林的代表商量。
    缔结结束德国分裂局面的公正而持久的和约，一向是而且仍然是美国政府的基本目标。正如苏联政府自己所承认的，如果要缔结这样的条约，就必须成立代表德国人民意志的全德政府。只有以在联邦共和国、苏联占领区和柏林举行自由选举为基础，这样的政府才能够成立。只有在德国人民的民族自由和个人自由获得保障的情况下，这样的选举才能举行。为了确定这个首要的基本条件是否存在，联合国大会已经任命了一个委员会，负责在联邦共和国、苏联占领区和柏林同时进行调查。这个调查委员会已经获得了在联邦共和国和柏林西区得到必要的活动便利的保证。如果在苏联占领区和柏林东区，也提供这样的便利，使这个委员会得以履行它的任务，美国政府会感到十分欣慰。
    苏联政府的照会并没有表明全德政府在和约缔结以前的国际地位如何。美国政府认为：无论在和约缔结以前或以后，全德政府都应该有自由加入符合联合国的原则和宗旨的联盟。
    在提出关于对德和约的建议的同时，苏联政府又表示愿意讨论其他的建议。美国政府对于这个声明，给予了适当的注意。美国政府认为，在自由选举的条件创造出来以前，在能够参加讨论和约的自由全德政府组成以前，是不可能详细讨论和约的。并且还有若干基本问题须待解决。
    例如，美国政府注意到，苏联政府声明说，德国的领土应以波茨坦会议的决议所规定的疆界为限。美国政府愿意提醒一下，事实上，波茨坦的决议并未规定具体的德国疆界，波茨坦的决议明白规定，领土问题须待缔和时来加以最后决定。
    美国政府并见到，苏联政府现在认为和约应当规定德国建立国家的陆海空部队，而同时对德国与其他国家结盟的自由则加以限制。美国政府认为这些条款等于倒退了一步，并可能阻碍一个国际关系基于合作而不是基于敌对和互不信任的新纪元在欧洲出现。美国政府深信需要一个使欧洲统一的政策，所以它正在全力支持能使德国参加纯粹防御性质的欧洲社会的计划；这个欧洲社会将维护自由、防止侵略和杜绝军国主义复活的可能性。美国政府认为，苏联政府提出的德国可以建立国家军队的建议，是与达到这项目标相矛盾的。美国政府仍然相信，这个使欧洲统一的政策威胁不了任何国家的利益，并且是和平的真正道路。
    苏联政府于一九五二年四月九日提出的照会
    “关于美国政府于今年三月二十五日提出的照会，苏联政府认为有必要作以下的声明。
    苏联政府在三月十日提出的照会中，曾向美国政府、英国政府和法国政府建议，毫不迟延地讨论对德和约问题，俾能在眼前将来拟就一致协议的和约草案。为了便于拟定和约，苏联政府曾提出一个对德和约原则草案，并表示也愿意讨论任何其它建议。
    苏联政府曾建议在一个代表德国的全德政府直接参与下拟定和约。
    三月十日的照会并规定在德国行使占领权力的苏联、美国、英国、法国应该研究有利于早日成立表达德国人民意志的全德政府的条件。
    苏联政府所以提出它的这些关于对德和约与成立全德政府的建议，是根据这个事实：解决这些基本问题对加强欧洲和平是极为重要的，而且是符合对德国人民的合法民族利益采取公正态度这个必要条件的。
    缔结对德和约刻不容缓，使得苏联、美国、英国、法国政府有必要采取紧急措施来统一德国并成立全德政府。因此，苏联政府认为苏联、美国、英国、法国政府必须像苏联政府前已建议的那样，毫不迟延地讨论举行全德自由选举问题。苏联、美国、英国、法国政府都承认举行全德自由选举的需要，因此就创造了在眼前将来举行这种选举的全部可能性。
    至于为了即将到来的全德自由选举，由联合国委员会来调查是否存在举行这种选举的条件的建议，那是与联合国宪章冲突的，宪章第一百零七条规定联合国不得干涉德国事务。这种调查能由在德国行使占领权力的四国组成的调查团来进行。
    美国政府曾有机会研究苏联政府提出的对德和约原则草案。但美国政府没有表示同意开始讨论这个草案，也没有提出它自己的和约草案。
    同时，美国政府对于苏联提出的对德和约原则草案中的个别项目却提出了若干异议，使两国政府间不得不再交换照会，而延误了通过国际间的直接讨论就能避免的争执问题的解决。但是由于美国在三月二十五日的照会中提出了若干这种问题，苏联政府认为有必要对它们作详细的说明。
    苏联的对德和约原则草案说：‘德国必须保证不参加任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的集团或军事联盟。’
    苏联政府认为，这样一个建议符合执行对德占领职务的国家以及德国邻国的利益，同时并符合德国本身作为爱好和平与民主的国家的利益。这个建议并没有什么地方不可容忍地限制了德国的主权。然而，这建议使德国不可能参加任何旨在对付任何爱好和平国家的国家集团。
    苏联的对德和约原则草案说：‘德国可以为了自卫而保有自己本国的武装部队（陆军、海军和空军）。’
    大家都知道，苏联政府在对日和约草案中也提出了同样的建议。这样一个建议符合民族主权及各国平等的原则。我们简直不可能想像，日本有权利为了自卫目的而建立本国的武装部队，而德国则被剥夺了这种权利，处于恶劣的境况。毫无疑问，为了和平事业，为了德国民族，应该建立这样的国防军事力量，而不应该在西德建立以法西斯希特勒将领为首的复仇主义雇佣军队，这些人是要把欧洲投入第三次世界大战的深渊中的。
    至于德国的疆界问题，苏联政府认为，美国、苏联和英国政府在波茨坦会议上通过的、后来法国也参加的关于这方面的决议已经足够了，可以作为最后的决定。
    苏联政府再次向美国政府建议，马上和英、法两国政府一道共同来着手研究对德和约、统一德国及建立全德政府的问题。苏联政府认为，这些问题必须加以解决，没有什么理由再拖延下去。
    德国到底是要恢复为统一、独立和爱好和平的国家，成为欧洲爱好和平人民中的一员呢；还是继续处于分裂状态，使全欧洲因此而继续受到战争的威胁呢？这便是我们目前要决定的问题。
    苏联政府已同时将同样的照会两件分别送交英国和法国政府。”
    夏戴纽、柯明和格雷三位先生说，他们将把上述照会转达他们本国政府。
