Studying the Soviet Union's Advanced Bricklaying Method
Xinjiang Military Region Bricklayer Chen Dingguo's Team Improves Bricklaying Efficiency

Xinjiang Military Region bricklayer Chen Dingguo, during the winter construction last year, studied the Soviet Union's advanced bricklaying method together with the engineers, and improved the labor organization and operation methods, enabling his bricklaying team to create a record of averaging 850 bricks laid per hour. This increased their original labor efficiency by about eight times, and greatly exceeded the record of Su Changyou's team last winter.

Chen Dingguo's team, like Su Changyou's team, also used sectioned bricklaying and implemented specialized division of labor. However, their division of labor method and operation method were somewhat different from Su Changyou's team. Their team had one main worker responsible for bricklaying, and two auxiliary workers responsible for brick delivery and mortar spreading (if laying a two-brick thick wall, an additional bricklayer would be added to lay the inner layer of the wall). During work, the mortar spreading worker would pour the mortar onto the wall in front, and spread it evenly with a trowel to a thickness of about one centimeter. The main worker was positioned about sixty centimeters behind the mortar spreading worker, and did not use a trowel. He would take the brick by hand and place the brick at a slant on the mortar ten centimeters away from the previously laid brick, pushing it in diagonally so that the evenly spread mortar was squeezed into the brick joints. Skilled bricklayers could take a brick with one hand and simultaneously perform the work of placing the brick, pushing, and pressing it flat with the other hand. The brick delivery worker stood half a meter behind the bricklayer to deliver and select bricks for the bricklayer. The reason for the increased labor efficiency of Chen Dingguo's team, in addition to the fact that the bricklayers saved non-technical operation time after the specialized division of labor, was also due to the fact that the bricklayers reduced some redundant habitual movements during bricklaying after the operation method was changed. In the past, after picking up a brick, the bricklayer had to smear mortar on the brick four or five times with a trowel. After laying the brick, they still had to tap it, adjust it, and straighten it, scrape the edges, etc. After the operation method was changed, most of these habitual movements were eliminated.

### 学习苏联先进砌砖法  新疆军区瓦工陈定国小组提高砌砖效率

    学习苏联先进砌砖法
    新疆军区瓦工陈定国小组提高砌砖效率
    新疆军区瓦工陈定国，在去年冬季施工中和工程师一道学习苏联先进砌砖法，改进了劳动组织和操作方法，使他所在的瓦工小组创造了每小时平均砌砖八百五十块的纪录。这比他们原来的劳动效率提高了八倍左右，并且超过去冬苏长有小组的纪录很多。
    陈定国小组和苏长有小组一样，也是分段砌砖，实行专业分工。不过他们分工的方法和操作方法和苏长有小组的有些不同。他们小组由一个大工负责砌砖，两个辅助工人分作递砖和铺灰工作（如砌两砖厚的墙，就增加一个砌工，砌墙的内皮）。工作时，铺灰工人在前面把灰浆倒在墙上，用甩子摊平，厚度约一公分。大工位置在铺灰工人后面约六十公分处，不拿甩子，他用手接过砖，在距离已砌上的前一块砖十公分处把砖倾斜放在灰浆上，斜向推进，使平摊的灰浆挤到砖缝中。熟练的砌砖工人可以一只手接砖，同时另一只手进行放砖和推挤压平的工作。递砖工人站在砌砖工人身后半公尺处为砌砖工人递砖和选砖。陈定国小组劳动效率提高的原因除专业分工后砌砖工人节省了非技术操作时间外，还由于操作方法改变后，砌砖工人减少了过去在砌砖时的一些多余的习惯动作。过去砌砖工人拿起砖后，要用瓦刀把灰浆在砖上抹四次或五次，砌好以后还要敲敲拨拨，摆弄端正，括括边沿等。操作方法改变后，这些习惯动作就绝大部分被取消了。
