    Tianjin Municipal News and Publishing Bureau
    Lack of Specific Work Content, Waste of Manpower

    To the Editor: Since its establishment in the spring of 1950, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government News and Publishing Bureau has consistently lacked specific work content. In addition to the secretariat, the bureau has four sections, the most important of which is the News Release Section. This section had as many as eleven people at its peak (accounting for one-third of the total number of bureau staff). The task of this section is to release announcements of municipal news, but such news is not always available, so they have to interview general municipal news. Every day, seven or eight people go out to work, but only write one or two short news items when they return. Sometimes these people even compete with newspaper reporters for news. If they win, the news is sent to the newspaper but may not be published; if they lose, they are even more discouraged. The Publication Management Section has done some practical work, but often has disputes with the Bureau of Culture, the Artists Association, etc. Regarding some matters, you say it should be under your jurisdiction, I say it should be under my jurisdiction. It is worth noting that the work of the bureau has been stagnant for nearly a year, but this has not had any impact on any aspect. I suggest that these agencies, in the spirit of being responsible to the people, examine the phenomenon of manpower waste, launch discussions in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" movement, and put forward opinions as a reference for streamlining the organization.

    天津市新闻出版处
    工作缺乏具体内容浪费人力
    编辑同志：天津市人民政府新闻出版处自一九五零年春成立以来，一直缺少具体的工作内容。该处除秘书室外，还有四个科，其中最重要的是新闻发布科，该科人数最多时有十一人（占全处总人数的三分之一）。该科任务是发布公告性的市政新闻，但这类新闻并不是常常有，于是只好采访一般性的市政新闻。每天七、八个人外出工作，回来后不过写一两条短短的消息。有时这些人还和报社记者们抢消息，如抢赢了，消息送到报社不见得能登，抢输了就更泄气。出版管理科是做了一些实际工作的，但工作上往往和文化局、美协等发生争执。有些事情，你说应该归你管，我说应该归我管。值得注意的是，该处工作已停顿将近一年，但对各方面来说，并没有什么影响。我建议这些机关都要本着对人民负责的精神，检查人力浪费的现象，结合“三反”运动，展开讨论，提出意见，作为精简机构时的参考。王严春
