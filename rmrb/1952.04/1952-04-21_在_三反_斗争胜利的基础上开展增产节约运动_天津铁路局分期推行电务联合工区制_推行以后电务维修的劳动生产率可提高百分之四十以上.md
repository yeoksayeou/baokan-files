    On the Basis of Victory in the "Three-Anti" Campaign, Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Implements Electric Affairs Joint Work Zone System in Stages
    After Implementation, Labor Productivity of Electric Affairs Maintenance Can Be Increased by More Than 40 Percent
    In order to further promote the increase production and practice economy movement on the basis of the victory in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the Tianjin Railway Bureau is currently carrying out a large-scale and universal technical improvement work in the main business departments in a step-by-step manner, promoting advanced working methods to improve labor productivity. Following the implementation of the high-speed cutting method, they have summarized the typical experimental experience of the electric affairs, communications, and signal work zones in Fengzhen and Changli in implementing the joint work zone system, and ordered the electric affairs departments of the entire railway to promote it in stages. In addition to the fourteen joint work zones that have already been implemented, twenty-six will be implemented in the second quarter, and sixty-five will be implemented in the third and fourth quarters. It is planned to complete the implementation by the end of the year, and one hundred and five joint work zones can be established. Calculated only on the basis of saving labor, the entire railway can reduce the staffing of electric affairs workers by 315 people. After implementation, the annual savings in wages are estimated to be about 1.9 billion yuan, and the labor productivity of electric affairs maintenance can be increased by more than 40 percent.
    The joint work zone is an advanced experience of the Soviet railways, which is to merge the communications and signal work zones to work together, and communications or signal workers can do the work of both communications and signals. Such a work zone is called a "joint work zone." The China Changchun Railway Administration has effectively implemented it. According to the experience of the Tianjin Railway Bureau in learning from the China Changchun Railway Administration this time, it has been proved that this is currently the most effective advanced working method in railway electric affairs maintenance work to improve labor productivity and reduce costs.
    Most of the railway electric affairs communications work zones and signal work zones (note: some work zones have complex equipment, and the management scope is limited to one station, and there is no phenomenon of waiting for trains, so it is not suitable to implement the joint work zone system; because the implementation will not only have little effect, but also hinder the technical specialization of workers) have simple equipment, fixed workload, few train services, inconvenient round trips, and the work is from this station to that station, with great mobility. The operating time at the station is completely limited by the train timetable, so the waste of labor is very alarming. According to Fengzhen's experience, before the implementation of the joint work zone system, the average working time per person per day in the communications work zone was only four hours and fourteen minutes, and the signal work zone was only four hours and fifteen minutes, with a labor waste of 47 percent. Taking the signal inspection work from Fengzhen to Baoziwan Station as an example: the signal worker must take the 222nd or 152nd passenger train from Fengzhen to Baoziwan on the first night, and can only take the 151st passenger train back to Fengzhen at 10:55 pm on the second night, staying at Baoziwan Station for a whole day. But how much work is there in Baoziwan? The time required to inspect, clean, and oil all the signal equipment in the station is only six hours and ten minutes. This work is only done three times a month according to regulations, and the regular work is the switch inspection every three days, and the total inspection time only takes 50 minutes. That is to say, after traveling back and forth for two nights and one day, the work done is less than one hour, and most of the time is spent waiting for the train. The situation of the communications worker is also the same. The workers also cannot eat well, sleep well, and feel tired. After the implementation of the joint work zone system, the problem was solved. Because the communications workers have learned the signal technology, after the signal equipment is maintained, they can do the maintenance of the communications equipment, or inspect the communications lines, and can fully use the time spent at the station to do more work. As a result, production efficiency has been significantly improved, and the average working time per person per day can reach six hours and five minutes.
    According to the experience of Fengzhen and Changli, the main gains of implementing the joint work zone system are five: First, improve labor productivity, and one person can do the work of two people. The staffing has been reduced from seven to four, saving 43 percent of the labor force, and the two work zones can save about 36.69 million yuan in wages per year. Second, workers learn a second technology and improve their technical level. Third, simplify the organization. The two work zones are merged into one, and the work zones are greatly reduced, which is convenient for leadership. Fourth, reduce the reserve of materials and tools, and save working capital. The Fengzhen and Changli work zones saved a total of 3.01 million yuan. Fifth, save housing and office supplies. The two work zones occupy two office buildings; after the merger, one is enough.
    The joint work zone seems to be a change in labor organization, but the basis of this change is to improve the technical level of electric affairs workers. In addition to the first technology they already know, communications workers and signal workers must also learn the second technology from each other and improve their previous working methods. Therefore, the key to implementing the joint work zone is to learn the second technology. The fundamental method of learning is object education. According to the learning plan (generally three stages: first, the master teaches, the apprentice learns; second, the apprentice does, the master watches; third, the apprentice works alone), a mutual teaching and mutual learning contract should be established, and the technical operation process plan table of the two work zones should be merged to ensure that the master and apprentice are often together for teaching and learning, and learn by comparing with real objects. Establishing a learning system and a strict examination system is also necessary.
    In promoting the joint work zone system, it is very important to do a good job in ideological mobilization. Employees have many concerns about the implementation of the joint work zone, such as fear of relocation, fear of taking on more responsibilities, older workers fear that they are too old to learn, and the leaders of the two work zones look down on each other, and so on. The leaders should be good at enlightening education, dispelling everyone's concerns, criticizing incorrect ideas, so as to ensure good learning and ensure the smooth implementation of the joint work zone.
    After the implementation of the joint work zone, the following three problems need to be solved: First, the problem of calculating unit costs. One person does the work of communications and signals, and it is difficult to distinguish the consumption of labor and materials; but the cost must be calculated separately. Therefore, a system of separate recording of work and materials should be adopted. Second, the original communications and signal sections of the electric affairs section do not need to be set up separately, and should be merged to form a technical room to unify technical guidance. Third, after the communications workers and signal workers learn the second technology, they should uniformly change their job titles to electric affairs workers. Moreover, because the levels of communications and signal work zones in the same area are inconsistent, and the wages of technicians of the same level are different, the wages should be adjusted after the merger.

    在“三反”斗争胜利的基础上开展增产节约运动
    天津铁路局分期推行电务联合工区制
    推行以后电务维修的劳动生产率可提高百分之四十以上
    天津铁路管理局为了在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争胜利的基础上，深入开展增产节约运动，目前正在各主要业务部门有步骤地进行一个大规模的、普遍的技术改进工作，推行先进工作方法，以提高劳动生产率。继推行高速切削法之后，他们又总结了丰镇、昌黎两地电务通信、信号工区推行联合工区制的典型试验经验，命令全路电务部门分期推广。除现已推行的十四个联合工区外，第二季要推行二十六个，第三、四季要推行六十五个，计划到年底推行完毕，可成立一百零五个联合工区。仅就节省劳动力一项计算，全路可减少电务工定员三百十五人。推行以后，每年节约工薪费约计十九亿元，电务维修的劳动生产率可提高百分之四十以上。
    联合工区是苏联铁路先进经验，就是把通信、信号两个工区合并起来一起工作，通信或信号工都能作通信、信号的工作。这样的工区就叫“联合工区”。中长铁路管理局已行之有效。根据天津铁路管理局这次学习中长铁路管理局的经验，证明这是目前铁路电务维修工作中，提高劳动生产率和减低成本的最有效的先进工作方法。
    铁路电务通信工区和信号工区，绝大部分（按：有一部分工区设备复杂，管理范围只限于一个车站，没有等车的现象，则不宜推行联合工区制；因为推行之后不独收效不大，而且妨害工人技术专业化）都是设备简单、工作量固定、车次少、往返不便，而工作都是从这个车站到那个车站，流动性很大，在车站作业时间完全为列车运行时刻表所限制，因此劳动力的浪费是非常惊人的。据丰镇经验，推行联合工区制以前，通信工区平均每人每天工作时间不过四小时十四分，信号工区每人每天不过四小时十五分，劳动力浪费百分之四十七。以丰镇到堡子湾站的信号巡检工作为例：信号工必须在第一天晚上由丰镇乘坐二二二次或一五二次客车到达堡子湾，第二天晚上十点五十五分才能坐一五一次客车返丰镇，在堡子湾站停留整一天。但堡子湾有多少工作呢？对全站信号设备进行检查、清扫、注油等所需的时间不过六小时十分钟。这一项工作按规定每月仅三次，经常工作是每三天一次的道岔检查，全部检查时间只需五十分钟。也就是说，往返两夜一天，做的工作还到不了一点钟，经常是大部分时间消磨在等车中。通信工的情形也是如此。工人们还吃不好，睡不好，觉得劳累。在推行联合工区制以后，问题解决了。由于通信工人学会了信号技术，信号设备维修完了，就做通信设备的维修，或巡视通信电线路，就可充分利用在车站停留时间多做工作。这样一来生产效能显著提高了，平均每人每天工作时间可达到六小时零五分。
    据丰镇、昌黎两地经验，推行联合工区制的主要收获有五：第一、提高劳动生产率，一个人可做两个人的工作。定员都由七人减为四人，节约劳动力百分之四十三，两地工区每年约可节省工资三千六百六十九万元。第二、工人学会了第二种技术，提高了技术水平。第三、精简了机构。两个工区合并为一个，工区大大减少，便于领导。第四、减少了材料、工具的储备量，节约流动资金。丰镇、昌黎两工区共计节约了三百零一万元。第五、节约了房屋及事务用品。两个工区占两所办公房屋；合并后，一所就够了。
    联合工区看来是一种劳动组织的改变，但这种改变的基础，是提高电务工人的技术水平。通信工和信号工除了自己已会的第一种技术外，还要互相学会第二种技术，并改进以往的工作方法。因此，推行联合工区的关键在于学习第二种技术。学习的根本方法是实物教育。要根据学习计划（一般是三个阶段：一是师傅教，徒弟学；二是徒弟做，师傅看；三是徒弟单独工作），订立互教互学合同，并合并两个工区的技术作业过程计划表，保证师徒经常在一起教学，比照实物学习。建立学习制度和严格的考试制度也是必要的。
    在推行联合工区制中，做好思想动员工作是很重要的一环。职工对推行联合工区有许多顾虑，如怕调动，怕多担责任，老年工人怕岁数大学不了，两个工区的工长互相瞧不起等等。领导方面要善于启发教育，解除大家的顾虑，批判不正确的思想，才能保证学习得好，保证联合工区的顺利推行。
    推行联合工区以后，需要解决以下三个问题：第一、计算单位成本问题。一人做通信和信号两种工作，工料消费难以分清；但成本要分开计算。因此，应采取分别记工记料的制度。第二、电务段原有的通信股、信号股没有分设的必要，应合并成立技术室，统一技术指导。第三、通信工、信号工在学会第二技术后，应统一改变职名为电务工。又因同一地区的通信信号工区等级不一致，同一等级技术工人工资不同，合并后应调整工资。（梁况白）
