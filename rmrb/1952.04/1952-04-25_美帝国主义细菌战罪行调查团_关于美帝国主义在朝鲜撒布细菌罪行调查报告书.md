"Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism"
Report on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialism in Spreading Bacteria in Korea

Foreword

On January 28, 1952, the U.S. aggressors began a large-scale bacteriological war in Korea. On February 22, Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement protesting the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare. On February 24, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement supporting the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs' protest against the U.S. government's bacteriological warfare. However, the U.S. aggressors not only did not stop the bacteriological war, but intensified it, extending it into the northeastern territory of the People's Republic of China. On March 8, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, issued a serious protest against the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese people and violate Chinese airspace. But until the drafting of this report, the U.S. aggressors not only did not stop the bacteriological war, but intensified it on an even larger scale. As of March 31, according to incomplete statistics, the U.S. aggressors had dropped insects and various poisons 804 times throughout North Korea, spreading them not only on the military front lines, but also throughout the vast areas of cities, factories, and rural unarmed residents. As for our country, the insects with germs and viruses spread by the U.S. aggressors have expanded from the Northeast to Qingdao and other places.

While expanding the bacteriological war, the U.S. government vehemently denied its atrocities of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The U.S. government and American news agencies simultaneously carried out various denials and propaganda, spreading rumors and attempting to describe their crimes of bacteriological warfare as "natural plagues in Korea and China."

The U.S. government, disregarding the constraints of international law, disregarding humanity, and disregarding the fair public opinion of the world's people, brazenly carried out the atrocities of bacteriological warfare, arousing the righteous indignation of all the people of China and the people of the world.

Under the initiation of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Red Cross Society of China, the Joint Association of Chinese Natural Science Academic Societies, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, the Chinese Medical Association, various democratic parties, religious circles, as well as literary and art workers and journalists, formed the Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism to conduct a thorough investigation into the crimes of American aggressors' bacteriological warfare in Northeast China and Korea, and to publish the investigation results to all peace-loving people in the world.

The investigation team included representatives from the Red Cross Society of China, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, Christian circles, as well as experts in entomology, bacteriology, parasitology, rickettsiology, virology, pathology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, public health, chemistry, biology, agriculture, and veterinary medicine. Among the experts, Wei Xi and Liu Weitong had received "medals of honor" from the U.S. military during the War of Resistance Against Japan on the Yunnan-Burma battlefield. After personally verifying the crimes of the U.S. aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare, these two experts considered it a disgrace to wear "medals" awarded by the U.S. government, the culprit of bacteriological warfare, and have turned in their "medals" to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression for disposal.

The investigation team departed from Beijing on March 15th. After arriving in Shenyang, a portion of the personnel formed a sub-team to conduct investigations in various parts of Northeast China. The Northeast sub-team completed its investigation on April 1st and issued the "Report on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialism in Spreading Bacteria in Northeast China by the Northeast Sub-Team of the Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" on April 3rd.

After arriving at the Korean base on March 20, the investigation team contacted the Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Health Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-Epidemic and Inspection Team. They studied the materials on the insects and other animals and items spread by the U.S. government in Korea and gained an in-depth understanding and review of the various experiments and results obtained by the Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-Epidemic and Inspection Team. The inspection team established a series of inspection stations in the front and base, equipped with complete equipment and literature, and conducted inspections in bacteriology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and other medical aspects. After detailed investigation and repeated discussions by the investigation team, we believe that the test results and conclusions made by the experts of the test team with skilled skills and high enthusiasm are completely reliable. In addition to leaving a part to participate in the review work of the inspection team, the investigation team was divided into two squads to conduct key investigations in the Wonsan area and near the central part of the 38th parallel, interviewing witnesses and collecting various physical evidences. On April 3, representatives of the Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representatives of the Korean People's Army, representatives of various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and witnesses who witnessed the US aircraft spreading insects and artillery firing insect bombs or gas bombs came to the base and held a forum with all members of the investigation team. Each witness answered the inquiry of the investigation team. During this period, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured American prisoners of war and special agents who were parachuted by the American aggressors to detect the effect of bacteriological warfare, and confessed the undeniable facts of the American government's bacteriological warfare. On April 5, all members of the investigation team visited Pyongyang. Thanks to the full cooperation of the Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the investigation team deeply understood the various materials held by the Korean government. The investigation team fully exchanged the obtained materials with representatives of the Korean Ministry of Health, medical experts, and epidemic prevention personnel, and listened to the reports of witnesses in Pyongyang who personally witnessed US aircraft spreading insects. During its stay in Korea, the investigation team visited more than 150 witnesses and witnessed 1,165 pieces of physical evidence. The testimony of important witnesses, the voluntary testimony of American prisoners of war, and the confession of captured agents were recorded; photos were taken of the witnesses and the various insect containers, shells, insect bombs, and various insect poisons used by the American government; the inspection work carried out by the Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-Epidemic and Inspection Team has been filmed into a documentary film.

Based on these materials and inspection results, the investigation team determined that the U.S. government used aircraft, shells, and other methods to spread a large number of insects and other poisonous substances containing germs, and the evidence is very conclusive. The test results of the insects and poisons spread by the United States have confirmed the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as plague, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery. We also have materials proving that the American aggressors are using anthrax bacillus and other pathogens. Facts have proved that the U.S. government is attempting to use the above methods to create artificial plagues in Korea, to kill a large number of Korean people and Chinese and Korean troops, and to poison Korean livestock and damage crops on a large scale.

No shameless denial by the U.S. government can overturn the facts listed below.

The investigation materials and expert inspection results of the investigation team are reported as follows:

Chapter 1: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Insects and Other Animals and Items

I. Methods of Spreading
The U.S. aggressors mainly used aircraft to spread insects, animals, and other items, and also used artillery fire on the front lines. The most important method of spreading by aircraft was spraying, directly spraying insects. When conducting such spreading, U.S. aircraft mostly flew at low altitudes or dived to spray. Larger animals and birds, as well as scattered items, were often dropped directly from the aircraft. Regarding this method of spreading, we can cite the following examples:

A. At 12:40 noon on February 11, Li Qingxiang, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and others personally saw three U.S. P51 fighter planes spraying insects such as flower flies, black springtails, and stoneflies at a low altitude of about 300 meters near Naiwenli, Machangmian, Cheorwon County, spreading them on the snow-covered ground with a width of 10 kilometers from east to west and 5 kilometers from north to south, and appearing in large quantities in shady places. The temperature at that time was minus 4 degrees Celsius, and many of the flower flies that were spread soon froze to death. Some of those that were spread in the shady places that did not die, later slowly flew towards the sunny side.

B. At about 2 p.m. on March 9, Zhang Anchang and other soldiers of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army discovered two U.S. aircraft flying in from the northwest in Chuanneimian, Munchon County, circling once. The aircraft behind dived down and dropped two black masses, one falling on the western hillside and the other on the eastern hillside. After the U.S. aircraft flew away, health worker Kang Kemin led Zhang Anchang and 10 others to search, but did not find the black masses, but found a large number of flower flies and other insects at the places where the black masses fell.

C. At 11:40 a.m. on April 2, six comrades from this group and Alan Winnington, a reporter from the British Worker's Daily, personally saw U.S. aircraft flying over a certain place, dropping a large number of leaves and stoneflies, which fell all over them.

In addition to the spraying method, the U.S. aggressors also dropped several types of bombs or containers containing insects from aircraft. One of the most common types is the four-compartment insect bomb. This bomb is 137 cm long (including the tail), 36.4 cm in diameter, and consists of two halves, divided into four compartments inside. The shell is made of steel skin, only 0.15 cm thick, and after exploding, it splits into two complete halves. The U.S. military has used such shells to spread leaflets. However, the bombs found recently did not have leaflets nearby after falling, but many insects were found around them. The outer skin of this bomb is marked with the word "EMPTY". Regarding the U.S. military's dropping of this type of insect bomb, the following example can be cited:

At 8 a.m. on March 26, a U.S. aircraft circled over Mashangli, Ningyuanmian, Ningyuan County. Han Lutao, assistant military doctor of a unit of the Volunteer Army, personally saw the aircraft dive and drop two bombs. One bomb landed in Mashangli, leaving a 5-inch deep bomb crater; the other bomb landed in Wenguli, Ningyuanmian, about 2,200 meters away from the previous bomb. Both bombs exploded into two halves, each creating a dense insect (mainly stoneflies) area of about 200 meters long and 100 meters wide. The average density was more than 100 insects per square meter, with the highest density inside the bomb crater. Insects were still crawling out of the exploded shell.

Regarding the use of four-compartment insect bombs, the U.S. aggressors once sophistically said that they were just propaganda bombs. However, according to an Associated Press report on April 5 this year, Congressman Sykes, Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, said publicly to the press after listening to the secret testimony of General Bruns, Commander of the U.S. Chemical Corps: "He (referring to Bruns) said that the tools for spreading bacteria in enemy territory are simple, and the troops now have ample storage of this equipment... such as the containers currently used to drop propaganda leaflets."

The second type of insect bomb repeatedly dropped by U.S. aircraft is in the shape of a paper tube, with a small parachute attached to the top and a timed fuse installed at the bottom. Three types of insect bombs belonging to this category, with minor differences, have been discovered. One type of paper tube is particularly thick (36 cm long, 13 cm in diameter, 1 cm thick). In order to deceive, the U.S. aggressors also marked it as a "parachute flare." In fact, the paper tube of this bomb is heavier, and the parachute is particularly small (about 55 cm square when opened, about 30 times smaller than the parachutes attached to ordinary U.S. flares), making it impossible to keep it floating in the air for a long time. At the same time, after the bottom of this bomb exploded, there was no trace of burning on the paper inside, so it could not be a flare. On March 26, Wen Jiachen, a soldier of a unit of the Volunteer Army, picked up this type of paper tube dropped by U.S. aircraft in Mingwenli, Jiangdong County, and there were many midges nearby.

The third type of container dropped from the air in which insects were found is a small cylindrical copper wire mesh cage, made of metal, 10 cm long and 6 cm in diameter, with six rows of small holes on the surface, covered with a layer of fine copper wire mesh on the outside and both ends, and a hole at one end. This is clearly a container for holding rats, fleas, and other insects. On March 27, U.S. aircraft circled over the Xinglishan mountain area in Longximian, Bochuan County, and dropped this type of container. Soldier Li Zhengcai found a large number of fleas and other insects inside.

The fourth type is aircraft bombs made of special materials. U.S. aircraft have dropped bombs with light metal shells (for example, those dropped on March 14 in Xingingli, Tushanian, Jinchuan County) and bombs with light green plastic shells (for example, those dropped on February 28 and March 26 in Guangdaidai, Cheorwon County) more than once. After the explosion, many flies and other insects were found around the shell. In addition, there is a green plastic bullet, with the top section made of light metal, about the size of a grenade, which explodes like a pomegranate.

The fifth type of insect container is an insect bomb that looks slightly like a grenade with a handle. At 8 p.m. on March 5, Qi Dengshen, a cultural instructor of a unit of the Volunteer Army, personally saw a U.S. aircraft flying from the southwest to the northeast in Jinchuanli, Rennanmian, Jinhua County, dropping a bomb that did not explode at the time. At 10 a.m. the next morning, he and the cooks suddenly saw a plume of blue-black smoke rising from the place where the bomb landed, making a hissing sound. After the smoke cleared, they saw many nail-sized spiders crawling out of the shell in all directions. The bomb was about 3 cm in diameter and about 9 cm long, made of light metal; the head of the bomb was about the size of two fists, with a thin skin, and inside there was a thin iron shell the size of an apple. There was an iron plate between the two layers of metal shells, and after the explosion, the head of the bomb cracked like petals.

The U.S. aggressors also used various methods to drop insects, animals, and various items.

At 7:30 a.m. on March 10, Liang Ruhai of a unit of the Volunteer Army personally saw a U.S. aircraft dropping kraft paper bags, each more than a foot wide and long, over the mountain southeast of Zhichengli, east of Changdaoli. After the paper bags landed and broke, many black and red spiders crawled out, covering an area of more than 40 meters wide and 50 meters long. In the most concentrated areas, there were thousands of spiders within 5 square meters. The bags were marked with "71400".

In order to spread plague, the U.S. aggressors used aircraft to drop rats. At 4 a.m. on February 20, Huang Shengchang, a sentinel of a unit of the Volunteer Army, personally saw a U.S. aircraft circling over Lantian Station near the ball field in Ningbian County and dropping an object that did not explode upon landing. He went to check and found a rectangular green wooden box, about half a meter long, with many small holes on all four sides. The box was broken upon landing, and there was a dead rat near the box board. At 10 a.m. on March 16, Yan Dezhi, a cultural instructor of a unit of the Volunteer Army, personally saw U.S. aircraft dropping many white objects near Guihuadong, Pingyuanli, Su'an County, and then found 21 cotton packages weighing about ten taels on the ground, containing rat droppings.

Finally, the U.S. aggressors repeatedly dropped protein objects containing bacteria that had been dried by vacuum freeze-drying. For example, at 2:30 p.m. on March 9, two U.S. Mustang fighter planes dived once over Lidong, Gunnaeimyeon, Munchon County, Gangwon Province, but there was no strafing or bombing sound. At that time, Li Fatang, deputy squad leader of the breeding squad of a unit of the Volunteer Army, felt strange and ran out to see a lot of insects on the snow. After checking by Li Qinghua, deputy director of the health center, white viscous objects were found on the snow, with depressions in the middle, of different sizes, and shaped somewhat like half a degelled egg. The larger ones were 3 cm in diameter and weighed about 10 grams, and contained more than 100 black springtails. When this white viscous substance was dropped, it hit the snow to form a depression of about 3 cm, and one of them landed on a tree branch. This viscous substance quickly turned into liquid when exposed to water or snow.

In addition to using aircraft to spread poisonous insects and poisons, the U.S. aggressors also used artillery to fire insect shells. For example, on February 27, the U.S. military used volley fire on our positions near the front line of Jinhua, and a few shells made a slight explosion sound. After the firing stopped, flies and spiders were found at five impact points. At 9:45 p.m. on March 6, the U.S. military fired several shells at a high ground in a certain place in Jinhua. More than a dozen insects were found attached to the exploded steel shell fragments. According to the shell fragments inspected by the forward troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the shells fired by the U.S. military, in addition to ordinary high-explosive shells and gas shells (both of which use steel as the shell), also had shells made of light metal, shells made of dark green plastic, and shells with light metal at one end and dark green plastic at the other. From these unusual shell materials, the presence of insects near the shell fragments, and the slight explosion sound, it can be proved that these shells were all used to launch insects and other animals.

II. Insects, Animals, and Other Items Spread

Among the things spread by the U.S. aggressors, insects accounted for the main share in terms of quantity. Among the insects, flower flies (black flies) were the most common. This is natural, because flies can easily carry germs, and it is also easiest to cultivate them artificially in large quantities in a short period of time. In addition, the main insects spread include black springtails (snow fleas), stoneflies (also known as stone flies, commonly known as flying ants), and midges. In addition to insects, the U.S. aggressors also dropped spiders and ticks. The main larger animals dropped were rats, and their attempt to use rat fleas to spread plague bacteria is very obvious. In addition, there are fish, birds, rabbits, snakes, dead pigs, etc. On the plant side, leaves, branches, bean stalks, and bean pods were dropped. The U.S. aggressors also dropped cotton, chicken feathers, medicines, food, and other items containing poison.

III. Areas of Spreading

The U.S. aggressors' spreading of insects and other poisons in Korea was not discovered until January 28 of this year. On that day, the area where the insects were spread had an outdoor temperature of minus 19 degrees Celsius, and it was impossible for a large number of various insects to suddenly appear in nature. From that time until March 31, the U.S. aggressors spread insects and dropped other animals and items as many as 804 times, according to incomplete statistics. The insect density created on the ground sometimes reached more than 1,000 insects per square meter. The spreading areas cover 70 counties and cities in Korea, mainly concentrated in areas close to the front lines, important cities and transportation lines in the rear. This shows that the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare is well planned.

Chapter 2: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Plague Bacilli

Korea has not had plague for many years. A report on epidemics in Korea published by the U.S. Department of the Navy also affirmed that Korea has not had plague for many years.

In Korea, where no plague has been found, the U.S. aggressors actually used such a dangerous infectious disease as plague as a tool of war, dropping rats and fleas carrying plague germs from aircraft in an attempt to cause a plague epidemic to kill a large number of people in order to achieve their aggressive goals.

In the areas where the U.S. aggressors dropped rats from the air, we have found many rats infected with plague bacilli. After detailed bacteriological and immunological tests, using smear staining, bacterial culture, serum reaction, animal inoculation, and pathological section methods, it was proven that these rats carried plague bacilli.

In the same areas mentioned above, we also found plague patients. Specimens of sputum and blood were taken from these patients, and pathological autopsies were performed on the patients' bodies. After detailed bacteriological, immunological, and pathological examinations, using smear staining, bacterial culture, serum reaction, animal inoculation, and pathological section methods, it was proven that these patients were also infected with plague bacilli.

The symptoms of the above-mentioned plague patients developed very rapidly, with sudden onset and a short course, and most died within 24 hours. Although the lymph nodes on the surface of the patient's body were slightly swollen, they were not significant, but plague bacilli were found in the blood, internal organs, and sputum. The results of these cases proved that it was septicemic plague.

Plague generally begins to occur and spread in the warm summer season. This time, the Korean plague occurred in the cold season below 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, it further illustrates that the occurrence of these plague patients is man-made and directly caused by the U.S. aggressors.

The plague patients and diseased rats mentioned above were found in places far away from the Chinese border. From that area northward to our border, there is no plague. In the northeastern provinces of our country adjacent to Korea, there has been no plague for several years. Plague can only spread along transportation lines, and it cannot spread long distances in a leap.

This once again proves that the plague currently discovered in Korea is caused by the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare.

Chapter 3: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Cholera Vibrio

On March 6, 1952, the first case of true cholera occurred in Pyongyang City. The patient's name was Han Sang-guk, male, 68 years old, and he lived in Nanmun-ri, Jung-gu, Pyongyang City. Emergency epidemic prevention measures were taken to prevent the continued spread of cholera.

U.S. aircraft raided Pyongyang on the night of March 4, flying over the residential area of Han Sang-guk. On the morning of March 5, after Han Sang-guk got up, he found many flies and some white paper packets on the ground with white frost in the yard of his residence and on the street outside the door. He opened the paper packets and found flies inside, and then swept away the flies and paper packets. Han Sang-guk suddenly fell ill on the night of March 6, vomiting and diarrhea, and then the diarrhea worsened, and the stool was like rice water. He died on March 8 after ineffective treatment.

The patient's stool was subjected to detailed bacteriological and immunological examinations, and an autopsy was performed on the body. A large number of motile vibrios were found in the stool, and Gram staining showed negative. The stool was inoculated into peptone water, and after culturing, a film formed, and the same vibrios were found in the peptone water.

The bacteria showed a positive agglutination reaction to cholera immune serum, with an agglutination titer of 3,200 times. The Pfeiffer reaction was positive. The bacteria can liquefy gelatin, and in sugar decomposition experiments, it can ferment maltose, glucose, sucrose, and mannitol, and does not produce gas. The autopsy revealed severe dehydration and acute poisoning, with no other significant pathological changes. The same cholera vibrios, confirmed by bacteriological and immunological methods as described above, were also isolated from the small intestine of the corpse, and no Salmonella bacteria were found. Therefore, the cause of death of this patient can be completely and certainly determined to be true cholera.

Korea is not a cholera origin and has no infection center. The cholera that has prevailed in Korea in the past has all been spread from outside. The last time was in July 1946, when it was transmitted from American ships to Busan, and then spread from Busan to various parts of Korea. From 1947 and in the following years, no cholera has occurred in the area under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

From the perspective of the cholera season, the cholera that prevailed in Korea in the past mostly occurred in August, September, and October, while this cholera in Pyongyang City occurred in early March when the weather was still quite cold.

Based on the above facts, the occurrence of true cholera in Pyongyang City this time can be completely affirmed as man-made, caused by U.S. aircraft spreading flies carrying cholera bacteria, and caused by the U.S. aggressors using bacteriological weapons.

Chapter 4: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Germs of Other Digestive Tract Infectious Diseases

The U.S. aggressors used various methods of bacteriological warfare. In addition to spreading plague and cholera germs, they also used insects, small fish, cotton, and many other things to drop various infectious disease germs, attempting to cause a digestive tract infectious disease epidemic. The Chinese People's Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team conducted thorough inspections of the above-mentioned items, including: (1) observation of the vitality of the bacteria, (2) Gram staining, (3) biochemical reactions (including fermentation of glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, and indole production), (4) quantitative immune serum agglutination reaction, (5) bacteriophage phagocytic effect, confirming this attempt by the U.S. aggressors. Just citing a few examples is enough to illustrate the fact that the U.S. aggressors spread digestive system bacteria:

On March 5, 1952, U.S. aircraft dropped a batch of flower flies in Lingdili, Munchon County. The results of the inspection determined that this batch of flower flies carried typhoid bacilli.

On February 28, 1952, U.S. aircraft dropped a batch of flower flies in Yucheonli. The results of the inspection determined that this batch of flower flies carried Salmonella group B bacilli.

On March 7, 1952, the cotton dropped by U.S. aircraft on a high ground southwest of Shuning was inspected, and the results determined that the cotton carried Salmonella group B bacilli.

On March 10, 1952, U.S. aircraft dropped many one-and-a-half-inch-long fresh small fish on a hillside and dry paddy field in Nipingdong, Datong County. The internal organs were dissected and inspected, and the results determined that these small fish carried Shigella dysenteriae bacilli.

On February 25, 1952, U.S. aircraft dropped a batch of black springtails (snow fleas) in Shangbali and Shangshiliping Village. The results of the inspection determined that this batch of black springtails carried Shigella paradysenteriae bacilli.

Various large quantities of insects, fish, and other items, from all aspects of their appearance, have fully proven that they were dropped by the U.S. aggressors in a planned manner. The discovery of various digestive system bacteria in these insects, fish, and cotton further illustrates that the U.S. aggressors wanted to use water sources and food as media to create a digestive system infectious disease epidemic.

Chapter 5: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Anthrax Bacilli

According to the livestock infectious disease materials provided by veterinary experts in Korea and China, on February 28, U.S. aircraft dropped flies, rats, and bacteria-carrying insects and items in the ball park area. In March, an acute infectious disease of horses, cattle, and pigs suddenly occurred in the area. According to the report of the inspection agency, the main symptoms of these sick livestock during their lifetime were rapid breathing, colic, and swelling of the front chest and back throat. The post-mortem lesions were bleeding from natural orifices, poor blood coagulation, and particularly enlarged spleen. Anthrax bacilli were found in the blood examination.

Chapter 6: Evidence of U.S. Aggressors Spreading Bacteria-Carrying Leaves and Bean Pods that Poison Crops

Sun Zhijian, deputy political instructor of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, saw four U.S. Sabre jet planes circling over Yanfengli, Gaoanmyeon, Dingzhou County, North Pyongan Province, at 1 p.m. on March 20, dropping a black mass that scattered into a large area of leaves about 300 meters above the ground, slowly falling and covering the local rice fields and around the houses. In addition to leaves, there were also bean stalks and bean pods. The spreading area was as wide as 200 meters and 400 to 500 meters long, with about 15 or 16 leaves per square meter, and two or three bean pods and bean stalks.

The test results determined that the bean pods had soybean purple spot bacteria (Cercos-pora SoJina or Cerosparina Kikuchii). This bacterium is highly contagious, can remain on the bean pods for several years without dying, and can produce a large amount of spores at any time during the growth of soybeans for widespread dissemination. Severely diseased soybean seeds are destroyed, and lightly diseased seeds also grow severe purplish-brown spots, which will greatly reduce the yield.

Chapter 7: Confessions of American Prisoners of War and Parachuted Special Agents

The voluntary testimony provided by American prisoners of war captured on the Korean front also confirms the fact that the U.S. government is conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea.

The U.S. government is keeping its bacteriological warfare a closely guarded secret. However, the soldiers of the U.S. military have long heard about this and it has spread widely. At the same time, the U.S. government has inoculated some "vaccines that cannot be disclosed due to military secrets" to its troops in Korea to prevent its own troops from being infected by the germs and viruses that they spread themselves.

Darling P. Shipes (military number 14384491), a private first class of G Company, 179th Regiment, 45th Division of the U.S. military, captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, stated:

"On the evening of Saturday, November 17, 1951, I was waiting for a car on Tangjie Street, Sapporo, Japan, when I heard several soldiers of the 179th Regiment talking. One of them said, "I heard we are about to go to Korea." Another said, "Yes, but if the government's experiment is successful, maybe we won't go." The first one asked, "What kind of experiment? Where did you hear that?" The second one said, "I heard another guy say that the government is experimenting with some kind of bacteria that will be used in the Korean War."

On Sunday, November 2, 1951, at about 2:30 p.m., at Crawford Barracks, we lined up to go to the health center for vaccinations. We received a total of six types of vaccinations. But only four types were recorded on our vaccination certificates. Corporal Duncan and I asked the medical officer at the same time why only four types were recorded? The medical officer of our battalion replied: 'Those two types are not recorded due to special reasons of military secrecy.' This made me recall the conversation I heard at the Sapporo bus station. I think these two facts are clearly related to the bacteriological warfare we are currently conducting."

The U.S. government had long planned to implement bacteriological warfare education for its troops in Korea and preparing to go to Korea, and especially strengthened the bacteriological warfare training for artillery.

Marvin Lester Brown (military number 18397178), a private first class of 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 3rd Division of the U.S. military, captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, stated: "I (the undersigned) hereby certify that the U.S. military has used infectious disease bacterial shells to deal with the Communist troops in Korea. In mid-February 1952, I heard Corporal Barron of 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 3rd Division of the U.S. Infantry say on Highland 155: "The 65

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”
    关于美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布细菌罪行调查报告书
    前言
    一九五二年一月二十八日美国侵略者在朝鲜开始了大规模的细菌战。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于二月二十二日发表了抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的声明。我中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来于二月二十四日发表了支持朝鲜外务相抗议美国政府进行细菌战的声明。但美国侵略者不但没有停止细菌战，反而变本加厉地将细菌战一直延伸到我中华人民共和国的东北境内。我中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来又于三月八日发表了严重抗议美国政府使用细菌武器屠杀中国人民和侵犯中国领空的声明。但直到本报告书起草时止，美国侵略者不但没有停止细菌战，反而更扩大范围地加紧进行细菌战。迄三月三十一日止的不完全统计，美国侵略者在朝鲜全境撒下昆虫和各种毒物共达八百零四次，撒布的地域不但在军事前线，而且遍及城市、工厂、农村的非武装居民的广大地域。而对我国境内，美国侵略者所撒布的带有病菌病毒的昆虫，竟由东北扩大到青岛及其他地方。
    美国政府一面扩大进行细菌战，一面对其在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的暴行矢口否认。美国政府和美国新闻机关同时进行各种抵赖的宣传，散布谣言，企图将其进行细菌战的罪行称为“朝鲜和中国境内的天然瘟疫”。
    美国政府无视国际公法约束，无视人道，无视世界人民公正舆论，悍然进行细菌战的暴行，引起了全中国人民和全世界人民的义愤。
    中国红十字会总会、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国科学技术普及协会、中华医学会、各民主党派、宗教界、以及文艺工作者、新闻工作者，在中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的发起之下，组成了美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团，赴东北和朝鲜各地进行美国侵略者细菌战罪行的彻底调查，并将调查结果在全世界爱好和平人士面前公布出来。
    调查团包括中国红十字会总会、各人民团体、各民主党派、基督教界的代表，以及昆虫学、细菌学、寄生虫学、立克次体学、病毒学、病理学、临床医学、流行病学、公共卫生学、化学、生物学、农学及兽医学的各方面专家。在专家当中，魏曦与刘纬通二人曾在抗日战争时在滇缅战场上得到过美国军队的“荣誉勋章”，这两位专家在亲自证实美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行之后，认为佩带细菌战罪魁美国政府所颁发的“勋章”是自己的耻辱，已将“勋章”缴给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会听凭处理。
    调查团的专家包括：临床医学：李宗恩　中国协和医学院院长、热带病学专家方石珊　中华医学会总干事、内科专家宫乃泉　上海医学院院长、外科专家严仁英　北京大学医学院妇产科副教授、妇幼卫生专家细菌学：魏　曦　大连医学院细菌学系主任教授谢少文　中国协和医学院细菌学系主任教授杨叔雅　医学科学院研究员、细菌学专家谢知母　医学科学院研究员、细菌学专家刘纬通　医学科学院研究员、立克次体学专家郭成周　医学科学院研究员、细菌学专家沈鼎鸿　医学科学院研究员、细菌学专家方　亮　北京大学医学院细菌学科副教授程知义　医学科学院副研究员、细菌学专家昆虫学：刘崇乐　北京农业大学昆虫学系主任教授何　琦　大连医学院生物学系主任教授、昆虫学专家柳支英　浙江大学农学院教授、昆虫学专家流行病学：严镜清　北京大学医学院公共卫生学系主任、流行病学专家俞焕文　医学科学院流行病学系主任何观清　中国协和医学院公共卫生学系副教授、流行病学专家朱　聃　北京大学医学院公共卫生学系讲师、流行病学专家病理学：严家贵　上海医学院病理学系副教授寄生虫学：吴　光　医学科学院寄生虫学系主任赵振声　北京大学医学院寄生虫学系副教授包鼎丞　上海医学院寄生虫学系副教授兽医学：程绍迥　兽医学专家房晓文　兽医细菌学专家毒物化学：杨恩孚　中央卫生科学研究院研究员、生物化学专家俞永祥　医学科学院药学研究系助理研究员、毒物学专家其他科学：曾昭抡　北京大学化学系教授、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席张景钺　北京大学植物学系主任周建人　生物学专家杨显东　农学专家沈其益　北京农业大学植物病理学教授
    调查团于三月十五日由北京出发，抵达沈阳后将一部分人员组成了一个分团，在东北各地进行调查。东北分团于四月一日完成调查工作，并于四月三日发表了“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团东北分团关于美帝国主义在中国东北地区撒布细菌罪行调查报告书”。
    调查团于三月二十日到达朝鲜基地之后，与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省、中国人民志愿军卫生部及中国人民志愿防疫检验队取得联系，研究了美国政府在朝鲜散布昆虫及其他动物与物品的材料，并对中国人民志愿防疫检验队所做种种实验及所得结果，作了深入的了解与复查。检验队在前方及基地建立了一连串的检验站，配备有完备的设备和文献，进行了对于细菌、病理、昆虫、化学、及其他医学等各方面的检验。经过调查团的详细考察及反复讨论，我们认为检验队的专家以熟练的技能和高度的积极性所得出的检验结果及其所作出的结论，是完全可靠的。调查团除留下一部分参加检验队的复查工作之外，又分成两个小队，出发到元山一带和三八线中部的附近作了重点调查，访问了人证和搜集了各种物证。四月三日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省代表，朝鲜人民军代表，中国人民志愿军各部队的代表，及目睹美国飞机撒布昆虫，目睹美国炮兵发射昆虫弹或毒气弹的人证都来到基地和调查团全体团员举行座谈，各人证并回答了调查团的询问。在这期间，朝鲜人民军，和中国人民志愿军捕获了美军俘虏及美国侵略者空降下来的刺探细菌战效果的特务，供出了美国政府进行细菌战的无可抵赖的事实。四月五日，调查团全体团员访问了平壤。感谢朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省的全力协助，调查团深入地了解了朝鲜政府方面所掌握的各种材料。调查团与朝鲜保健省代表，医学专家，及防疫人员充分交换了所得材料，并听取了平壤市亲自目睹美国飞机撒布昆虫的人证的报告。调查团在朝鲜期间，访问了一百五十多名人证，目睹了一千一百六十五件物证。重要人证的证明，美国俘虏的自愿证明，及捕获的特务的口供，进行了录音；人证及美国政府所使用的各种昆虫容器、炮弹、昆虫弹、和所投下的各种昆虫毒物，进行了拍照；中国人民志愿防疫检验队所进行的检验工作已拍摄成为记录电影。
    根据这几方面的材料与检验结果，调查团认定美国政府利用飞机、炮弹及其他方法散布大量带有病菌的昆虫及其他毒物，证据已经十分确凿。对美国所撒布的昆虫及毒物的检验结果，到现在为止已经肯定的有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾等致病细菌。我们也有材料证明美国侵略者在使用着炭疽杆菌及其他病原体。事实证明，美国政府是企图利用上述手段，在朝鲜造成人工性的瘟疫，来大量杀害朝鲜人民及中朝部队，并企图大量毒害朝鲜的牲畜和损害农作物。
    美国政府任何无耻抵赖，绝不能推翻下文列举的各个事实。
    兹将调查团调查材料及专家检验结果报告如下：
    第一章  美国侵略者散布昆虫及其他动物与物品的证据
    一、散布的方法
    美国侵略者散布昆虫、动物及其他物品，主要是利用飞机，在前线亦兼用炮发射。飞机散布的最主要方法，是用喷雾法，将昆虫直接喷射下来。作这样散布时，美国飞机多作低空飞行，或俯冲喷射。较大动物及鸟类，以及零星物品，也往往是从飞机直接投下。关于这种散布方法，我们可以举出下列几个例子：
    甲、二月十一日中午十二时四十分，中国人民志愿军战士李清祥等亲眼看到美国P51型战斗机三架，在铁原郡马场面乃文里附近，于三百公尺左右的低空喷下花蝇、黑跳虫、襀翅虫等昆虫，撒布在东西十公里、南北五公里的雪地上，而且大量出现在背阴的地方。当时温度在摄氏表零下四度，撒下的许多花蝇，不久就冻死。还有原来撒在背阴的地方没有死的，后来才慢慢向阳飞去。
    乙、三月九日下午二时许，中国人民志愿军某部战士张安常等在文川郡川内面发现美国飞机两架从西北飞来，盘旋一周。后边一架俯冲下来投下两个黑团，一团落到西面山坡，一团落到东面山坡。美国飞机飞走以后，卫生员康克明领着张安常等十一人去找，并未找到黑团，却在黑团落处发现大量的花蝇及其他昆虫。
    丙、四月二日中午十一时四十分，本团有六位同志及英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿在某地亲见美国飞机飞过，投下大批树叶及襀翅虫，落满他们的身上。
    除喷雾法以外，美国侵略者还从飞机投下过几类装有昆虫的炸弹或容器。其中一类最常见的，是四格的昆虫弹。这种炸弹长一百三十七公分（连弹尾），直径三十六·四公分，由两半构成，里面分成四格，弹壳用钢皮制成，厚只○·一五公分，炸开后分成完整的两半。这样的弹壳，美军曾用以散传单。但是近来拣到的这种炸弹，落下后附近并没有传单，周围却发现有许多昆虫。这种炸弹弹皮外面却写有“空的”（EMPTY）字样。关于美军投下此种昆虫弹，可举下列一个例子：
    三月二十六日上午八时，有美国飞机一架，在宁远郡宁远面马上里上空盘旋，志愿军某部助理军医韩鲁涛亲眼看见该机俯冲，投下两弹。一弹落在马上里，有五寸深的弹坑；另一弹落在宁远面文谷里，距前一弹约二千二百公尺。两弹均炸成两半，每弹各造成约长二百公尺、宽一百公尺的昆虫（主要为襀翅虫）密集地带。平均密度为每平方公尺一百多只，以弹坑内为最密，炸开的弹壳里还有昆虫正向外爬。
    对于四格昆虫弹的使用，美国侵略者曾经狡辩着说，那不过是一种宣传品炸弹。但据本年四月五日美联社报道，美国众议院拨款小组委员会主席赛克斯，在听取了美国化学兵团司令布伦的秘密作证以后，公开对报界说：“他（指布伦）说，在敌人领土上散播细菌的工具是简单的，这种装备现在部队已有充分储存……如目前用以投掷宣传传单的容器”。
    第二类美国飞机多次投下的昆虫弹，是作纸筒形状，顶上连有一个小的降落伞，下端装置有定时引信。属于这类的昆虫弹，大同小异的，已发现有三种。其中一种纸筒特别厚的（筒长三十六公分，直径十三公分，厚一公分），美国侵略者为着进行欺骗，还将其标明为“带伞照明弹”。实际上此弹的纸筒较重，伞又特别小（张开约成五十五公分见方，比普通美军所投照明弹上带有之降落伞要小三十倍左右），绝不可能维持它长时间飘在空中。同时这种弹的底端炸掉后，里面的纸一点也没有燃烧过的痕迹，因此绝不可能是照明弹。三月二十六日，志愿军某部战士文家臣在江东郡明文里，拾得美国飞机空投的此类纸筒，附近有许多摇蚊。
    第三类空投的容器，里面发现有昆虫的，是一种小圆筒形状的铜丝网笼，金属制成，长十公分，直径六公分，表面有六行小孔，外面及两端均蒙有一层细铜丝网，一端有一洞。这显然是一种装老鼠、跳蚤及其他昆虫的器容。三月二十七日，美国飞机在博川郡龙西面星里山地上空盘旋后，投下此类容器，战士李正财发现里面有大量跳蚤等昆虫。
    第四类是特种材料制成的飞机炸弹。美国飞机，曾不止一次投下轻金属弹壳的炸弹（例如三月十四日在金川郡兔山面杏亭里瓦岱洞投下的）及淡绿色塑胶弹壳的炸弹（例如二月二十八日及三月二十六日在铁原郡光大岱投下的），炸后在弹皮四周都发现有很多苍蝇及其他昆虫。另外还有一种绿色塑胶弹，顶上一节为轻金属制成，大小约如手榴弹，炸开如石榴状。
    第五类昆虫容器是一种外形略似有柄的手榴弹的昆虫弹。三月五日晚八时，志愿军某部文化教员祁登绅，在金化郡任南面锦川里，亲眼看见美国飞机一架，由西南飞向东北，投下一弹，当时未炸。第二天上午十时，他和炊事班人员忽见落弹处冒起一股青黑色烟并发出嗤嗤的响声。烟过后，他们看到很多指甲盖大的蜘蛛正从弹壳里向四面爬出。该弹直径约三公分，长约九公分，是轻金属制成；弹头约两个拳头大，皮薄，里面又有苹果大的薄铁弹皮，两层金属弹皮中间有个铁盘，炸后弹头像花瓣似地裂开。
    美国侵略者还用各式各样的方法，投下昆虫、动物及各种物品。
    三月十日早晨七时半，志愿军某部梁如海亲见美国飞机一架在昌道里以东直城里东南山上空投下牛皮纸包，宽长各一尺多。纸包落地摔破后，里面爬出很多黑红色蜘蛛，面积宽达四十多公尺，长五十多公尺。最多的地方，在五平方公尺以内有几千个蜘蛛。包上有“71400”字样。
    美国侵略者为着散布鼠疫，曾用飞机投下老鼠。二月二十日上午四时志愿军某部哨兵黄胜昌，在宁边郡球场附近蓝田车站，亲见美国飞机一架，在车站上空盘旋投下一物，着地未炸，前去察看，发现一只长方形的绿色木箱，长约半公尺，四边有许多小孔。箱落地已摔破，靠近箱板有一死老鼠。三月十六日上午十时，志愿军某部文化教员鄢德智，在遂安郡平院里桂花洞附近，亲见美国飞机投下许多白色物体，随即发现地上落有二十一个约十两重的棉花包，里面有老鼠屎。
    最后美国侵略者还屡次投下经过真空冷冻干燥方法抽干的含菌蛋白质物体。例如，三月九日下午二时三十分，美国野马式战斗机两架，在江原道文川郡郡内面梨洞上空，向下俯冲一次，但未扫射也无炸弹声。当时志愿军某部饲养班副班长李发堂觉得奇怪，就跑出去看，见到雪地上有很多昆虫。后经卫生所副所长李庆华检查，发现雪地上有白色粘性物体，中间凹陷，大小不等，形状略似去黄的半个鸡蛋。大者直径三公分，重约十克左右，里面并有一百多个黑跳虫。当此白色粘性物体撒下时，将雪打成约三公分左右的凹窝，有一个还落在树枝上。此种粘性物体，见水或雪很快就化成液体。
    美国侵略者除用飞机散布毒虫、毒物以外，也用炮发射昆虫炮弹。例如二月二十七日，美军在金化附近前线，用排炮轰击我方阵地，其中少数炮弹炸声微小。射击停止后，即发现五处弹着点集有苍蝇、蜘蛛等。三月六日晚九时三刻，美军在金化某处高地，发射炮弹数发。在炸开的钢质弹片里发现附有昆虫十余只。美军炮兵所发炮弹，根据中国人民志愿军前方部队检得的弹片，除普通高炸药炮弹及毒气弹（这两类都是以钢作弹壳）外，并有用轻金属制成的弹壳，用深绿色塑胶制成的弹壳，以及一端用轻金属下接深绿色塑胶的弹壳。从这些不习见的弹壳质料，弹片附近发现有昆虫，炸声之轻微，可以证明这些炮弹都是用来发射昆虫及其他动物。
    二、散布的昆虫、动物及其他物品
    美国侵略者散布的东西，从数量上说，以昆虫占主要地位。昆虫当中，又以花蝇（黑蝇）最为常见。这是很自然的，因为蝇子很容易带病菌，同时又最容易大量地用人为方法于短期内培养出来。此外散布的昆虫，主要有黑跳虫（雪蚤）、襀翅虫（即石蝇、俗称飞蚂蚁）、摇蚊等。昆虫以外，美国侵略者还投下有蜘蛛及扁虱。投下的较大动物主要为老鼠，其利用鼠蚤来散布鼠疫菌的企图，是很显然的。此外有鱼、鸟类、兔子、蛇、死猪等。植物方面，投下有树叶、树枝、豆杆、豆荚等。美国侵略者还投下有带毒的棉花、鸡毛、药品、食品及其他物品。
    三、散布的地区
    美国侵略者在朝鲜散布昆虫及其他毒物，从今年一月二十八日起才被发觉。当日散布昆虫的地区，户外温度在摄氏零下十九度，自然界不可能有大量的各种昆虫突然出现。从那时起，到三月三十一日止，美国侵略者散布昆虫及投下其他动物与物品，据不完全的统计，已有八百零四次之多。其在地面上造成的昆虫密度，有时高达每平方公尺一千多只。散布地区，遍及朝鲜七十个郡市，主要集中在接近前线的地带，后方重要城市及交通线。由此可见美国侵略者进行细菌战，是有周密计划的。
    第二章    美国侵略者散布鼠疫杆菌的证据
    朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫。美国海军部印发的朝鲜流行病的报告也肯定的说，朝鲜多年没有鼠疫。
    在没有鼠疫发现的朝鲜，美国侵略者竟用鼠疫这样的危险传染病来做为战争的工具，用飞机投下带有鼠疫病菌的老鼠及跳蚤，企图引起鼠疫的流行来大量的杀害人类，以达到其侵略的目的。
    在美国侵略者从空中投放老鼠地区，我们已发现受鼠疫杆菌传染的老鼠多只。经过了细菌学及免疫学的详细化验检查，用涂片染色、细菌培养、血清反应、动物接种及病理切片方法，证明这些老鼠带有鼠疫杆菌。
    在上述同一地区，我们也发现鼠疫病人，从这些病人采取了痰及血液的标本，对患者尸体做了病理解剖，经过细菌学、免疫学及病理学的详尽检查，用涂片染色、细菌培养、血清反应、动物接种及病理切片方法，证明这些病人也同样是感染了鼠疫杆菌的患者。
    上述鼠疫病人，其症状发展是非常急剧的，骤然发作，病情经过短促，多数在二十四小时以内即死亡。患者身体表面的淋巴腺，虽稍有肿大，但并不显著，而在血液、内脏及痰内发现鼠疫杆菌。这些病例的检查结果，证明是败血型鼠疫。
    鼠疫一般地是在夏季温暖季节开始发生与流行的。这次朝鲜鼠疫却发生在摄氏零度以下的寒冷季节。因此，就更进一步的说明，这些鼠疫病人的发生是人为的，是美国侵略者直接造成的。
    上面所说鼠疫病人与病鼠是在远离中国边境的地方发现的。由该地区向北，一直到我国边境没有鼠疫。在我国东北与朝鲜相毗邻的各省已经数年来没有鼠疫。鼠疫是只能沿着交通线传播，它不能做长距离的飞跃式传播。
    这再一次证明，朝鲜当前发现的鼠疫，是美国侵略者细菌战所造成的。
    第三章    美国侵略者散布霍乱弧菌的证据
    平壤市于一九五二年三月六日发生第一个真性霍乱病人，患者名韩相国，男，六十八岁，住平壤市中区南门里。经采取紧急防疫措施，制止了霍乱的继续传播。
    美国飞机曾于三月四日夜间空袭平壤，在韩相国的住宅区上空飞过。三月五日早晨，韩相国起床后发现住宅院内及门口街上，还有白霜的地面上有许多蝇类及若干白色纸包。他将纸包打开发现里面有蝇类，随即将蝇类及纸包扫除。韩相国于三月六日夜间突然发病，上吐下泻，以后腹泻加剧，大便呈米汤状，经治疗无效，于三月八日死亡。
    这个病人的大便，经过了细菌学及免疫学的详细检查，并将尸体做了病理解剖。大便内发现有大量的活动的弧菌，革兰氏染色法呈阴性。将大便接种于蛋白胨水，经过培养后，有薄膜形成，蛋白胨水内有同样弧菌。
    菌种对于霍乱免疫血清呈阳性凝集反应，凝集价为三千二百倍。柏氏溶菌试验（Pfeipferreaction）为阳性。菌种能将明胶液化，在糖类分解试验中，能发酵麦芽糖、葡萄糖、蔗糖及甘露醇，不产气。尸体解剖发现了严重的脱水及急性中毒现象，没有其他重要病变。在尸体的小肠内也分离出来与上述完全相同的经细菌学免疫学方法证实的霍乱弧菌，而没有发现沙门氏属细菌。因之，这个病人的死亡原因，可以完全肯定是真性霍乱。
    朝鲜不是霍乱发源地，没有传染中心。过去在朝鲜流行过的霍乱，都是从外边传播进去的，最后一次是在一九四六年七月由美国船舶传到釜山，再由釜山传播到朝鲜各地。从一九四七年起及以后几年中，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府辖区内，没有发生过霍乱。
    从霍乱发生的季节来看，过去在朝鲜流行的霍乱，多在八、九、十月，而这次平壤市霍乱却发生在天气还相当寒冷的三月初旬。
    根据以上事实，这次平壤市真性霍乱的发生，可以完全肯定，是人为的，是美国飞机撒放带有霍乱病菌的蝇类所引起的，是美国侵略者施用细菌武器所造成的。
    第四章    美国侵略者散布其他消化系传染病病菌的证据
    美国侵略者施用细菌战的方法是多种多样的，除了撒布鼠疫和霍乱病菌外，它并利用昆虫，小鱼、棉花及其它许多东西，投下各种传染病菌，企图造成消化系传染病的流行。中国人民志愿防疫检验队对上述各物进行了周密的检验，包括：（一）菌的活动力的观察，（二）革兰氏染色，（三）生化反应（包括葡萄糖、乳糖、麦芽糖、甘露醇的发酵和靛基质产生力），（四）定量免疫血清凝集反应，（五）噬菌体噬菌作用，证实了美国侵略者这种企图。仅举下列几个例子，就可以说明美国侵略者撒布消化系病菌的事实：
    一九五二年三月五日，美国飞机在汶川郡岭底里投下一批花蝇。经检验得出结果，断定这批花蝇带有伤寒杆菌。
    一九五二年二月二十八日美国飞机在渔川里投下一批花蝇。经检验得出结果，断定这批花蝇带有沙门氏菌属乙群杆菌。
    一九五二年三月七日美国飞机在朔宁西南某高地投下的棉花，经检验得出结果，断定这些棉花带有沙门氏菌属乙群杆菌。
    一九五二年三月十日，美国飞机在大同郡泥坪洞投在一山坡及干稻田上许多一寸半长的新鲜小鱼，经解剖将内脏取出作了检验，得出结果，断定这些小鱼带有志贺氏赤痢杆菌。
    一九五二年二月二十五日美国飞机在上八里、上十里坪村投下一批黑跳虫（雪蚤），经检验得出结果，断定这批黑跳虫带有志贺氏副赤痢杆菌。
    各种大量的昆虫，鱼类及其他物件，从其出现的各方面情况看来，已充分的证明是美国侵略者有计划投下的。在这些昆虫、鱼类及棉花中发现各种消化系病菌，更加说明了美国侵略者，是想利用水源、食物为媒介制造消化系传染病的流行。
    第五章    美国侵略者散布炭疽杆菌的证据
    根据朝鲜和中国的兽医专家提供的牲畜传染病的材料，二月二十八日美国飞机在球场地区投下蝇子、老鼠及带菌的昆虫和物品，三月，在该地区突然发生了马牛猪的急性传染病，这些得病的牲畜，根据该检验机关的报告，其生前主要症血状为呼吸促迫、疝痛、胸前及后喉部肿胀，其死后病变为天然孔出血，血液凝固不良，脾脏特别肿大。检查血液，均发现炭疽杆菌。
    第六章    美国侵略者散布毒害农作物的带菌树叶及豆荚的证据
    中国人民志愿军某部副政治指导员孙志坚，于三月二十日下午一时，看见美国佩刀式喷气飞机四架，在平安北道定州郡高安面延丰里上空盘旋，丢下一个黑团，在离地面约三百公尺上空即散开为一大片树叶，慢慢落下，布满当地稻田及房屋四周。除树叶之外，还有豆杆豆荚。其散布面积宽达二百公尺，长四、五百公尺，每平方公尺约有树叶十五六片，豆荚，豆杆两三个不等。
    检验结果断定：豆荚上有大豆紫斑病菌（Cercos-pora    SoJina或Cerosparina    Kikuchii）。这种病菌有高度传染性，能留在豆荚上数年不死，在大豆生长期间，随时可以产生多量疱子，广为传布。受病大豆的种籽重则毁坏，轻的也长出严重的紫褐色斑，产量会因而大大减低。
    第七章    美军俘虏及空降特务的供词
    由朝鲜前线捕获的美军俘虏所自愿提供的证明，也证实了美国政府在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实。
    美国政府进行细菌战，是严守秘密的。可是，美国军队的士兵对这件事，早有所闻，并且传播得很广了。同时，美国政府对其在朝鲜的部队，接种了一些“因军事秘密而不能公开”的疫苗，来给自己的部队预防被自己亲手撒布的病菌、病毒的感染。
    为中国人民志愿军俘获的美军四十五师一七九团G连上等兵达林·夏普斯（Darling    P．Shipes）（军号一四三八四四九一）供称：
    “一九五一年十一月十七日星期六傍晚，我在日本扎幌汤街等候汽车、听到若干个一七九团的兵士在谈话。其中一个说：“听说我们即将开赴朝鲜了”。另一个说：“是的，但是，如果政府的实验成功，也许我们就不去了”。第一个问：“什么样的试验？你在那儿听到的？”第二个就说：“我听另一个家伙说，政府正在试验某种细菌，将用之于朝鲜战争”。
    一九五一年十一月二日星期日下午二时三十分许，在克劳福兵营，我们列队前往卫生所注射防疫针。我们先后共打了六种防疫针。但在我们的注射证上，仅登记了四种。邓肯下士和我同时问军医官，为什么只登记了四种？我们营的军医官回答说：‘那两种是由于军事秘密的特殊原因，而不登记的’。这件事使我回想到在扎幌汽车站所听到的谈话。我想这两件事实，显然是和我们目前所进行的细菌战有关的”。
    美国政府对其在朝鲜及准备开往朝鲜的部队，老早以前就有计划地实行细菌战的教育，特别加强对炮兵的细菌战训练。
    为中国人民志愿军捕获的美军步三师七团三营八连一等兵马汶·勃浪（Marvin    Lester    Brown）（军号一八三九七一七八）供称：“我（签名人）特此证明美国军队曾使用传染病细菌炮弹，对付在朝鲜的共军。我于一九五二年二月中，在一五五高地上听见步三师七团三营八连巴伦下士说：“美步三师六十五团曾使用传染病细菌炮弹对付在朝鲜的共军”。他于是给我一张报纸，报纸上有下面的标题：“美国炮兵装备有五百发传染病细菌炮弹对付在朝鲜的共军。第六十五团曾使用传染病细菌炮弹对付在朝鲜的共军，效果良好”。
    “我又曾二次看过关于美国使用传染病细菌炮弹的美国军中新闻电影。第一次系于一九五一年四月在夏威夷史哥飞而得军营看的。第二次系于一九五一年七月，在日本横滨莱克兵营看的。这部细菌炮弹中的电影印有“秘密，不得外传”的字眼。这部电影中，说明细菌炮弹装有苍蝇，苍蝇都带有传染细菌。这电影又说明传染病细菌炮弹是有效的，并且是危险的东西，应当巧妙地利用它”。
    美国政府为着检查他们进行的细菌战的效果，还组织一大批情报人员，空投在朝鲜各地进行侦察。
    美国侵略者所空投的特务谭泽民供称：“我叫谭泽民，湖南省茶陵县人，今年二十六岁，我是替美国人干特务工作的。今年一月二十七日起在日本东京受特务训练。特务学校的校长是一个叫伊藤的美国籍日本人。代理副校长兼教官的叫水野，也是美国籍日本人。他本来是美国远东司令部特务机关，心理作战部的特务。跟我一起受训的有十六个人。我们受了三个星期的特务训练。内容是情报学、武器识别、飞机识别、跳伞、地图识别、学习朝鲜话。训练完了后，我们被送到汉城，住在旧总督府右边大约五百米的一座日本式房子里，受一个朝鲜特务王允国的领导。
    三月九日特务机关给我一个任务。派我在志愿军后方伊川北面兄弟峰上空降落，调查细菌战的效果。调查的内容是：军队和居民的患病人数、时间、地点、疾病的种类和征候，生病的是年青的多还是年老的多，路上有没有死老鼠，有没有苍蝇、跳蚤、蜘蛛和别的虫类，朝鲜政府和军队用什么方法预防细菌传染病，一般人都注射过预防针没有，等等。
    我穿的是在东京伪造的志愿军军装，特务机关还发给我伪造的志愿军机关证件，北朝鲜币和人民币。他们并且发给我一支日本造的钢笔。叫我从老百姓那里打听消息，并且冒充志愿军人员混到部队里去收集情报。他们叫我在调查完毕后走内石桥越过防线回去。我在三月十三日降落，十六日晚上被捕。”
    结    论
    一、美国侵略者散布病菌和病毒的各种事实，俱有在场目睹的人证，及当场收集的物证。
    二、迄三月三十一日止，据不完全统计，美国侵略者散布昆虫、动物及其他物品的次数达八百零四次，面积达朝鲜七十个郡市。可见美国侵略者是有准备的有计划的，企图在朝鲜造成大规模的瘟疫。
    三、二月间美国飞机所散布的昆虫，俱在零下八、九度到十几度之气温下被发现的。在雪地上昆虫的散布面积，俱有一定长度宽度与密度；或积集在背向太阳之阴面，或竟有一部冻僵，有的只略能飞动。而且在敌机投下的昆虫中，竟发现大量种类完全不相同的昆虫如花蝇、黑跳虫、跳蚤、摇蚊、蜘蛛等混杂在一起，这正是证明这些昆虫与蜘蛛绝不是自然发生，而是由飞机散下来的。
    四、美国飞机散下来的昆虫、动物及带毒物品，经检验后发现鼠疫杆菌、伤寒杆菌、痢疾杆菌、霍乱弧菌、炭疽杆菌，及某种病毒等。
    五、朝鲜在很多年来并没有发生过鼠疫。从一九四七年以来，也没有发生过霍乱。现在鼠疫和霍乱又突然在冷天发生。这可以肯定，都是美国政府进行细菌战的直接结果。
    六、美国侵略者开始了细菌战之后，即派出特务空降到朝鲜各地，探听“死了病人多少？路上有没有发现死鼠？”正是美国侵略者侦察其细菌战效果的行动的证据，因而也就是美国侵略者进行细菌战的铁证。
    七、美国侵略军队的士兵到朝鲜战场来之前，除注射鼠疫、斑疹伤寒、破伤风、霍乱、伤寒、黄热病等防疫苗之外，更被强迫注射两种“因军事秘密而不能透露”的疫苗，这可以证明：美国还在使用其他的细菌或病毒，来进行细菌战，由俘虏的口供中，证实了美国侵略者曾在侵朝士兵中以电影及其他方式普遍进行细菌战教育，这是美帝国主义很早以来就准备在朝鲜进行细菌战的铁证。
    情况十分明白，美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战，是完全没有疑问的，完全肯定的，因此美国政府对其进行细菌战的一切罪行，是无可抵赖的。
    自一九五二年一月二十八日朝鲜人民和中朝部队所发现的美国侵略者所进行的细菌战，就是美国侵略者在朝鲜陆地战场上及空中战场上遭受了严重的挫败以后，企图用细菌战来达到其地面及空中武器所不能达到的侵略目的。
    一九五二年美国所开始的细菌战是大规模的。美国政府在朝鲜运用细菌战是有其一贯性的指导思想，是经过长期准备和有计划布置的。
    更重要的事实，就是一九五一年十一月，日本细菌战犯石井四郎到达汉城，大规模的细菌战就在一九五二年一月间爆发。
    美国政府企图抵赖，狡称朝鲜的严寒季节不可能发生鼠疫和霍乱伤寒。但恰恰在这严寒季节中，即在三月初有时还在降雪的平壤发生了霍乱，在二月中地面还铺着冰雪的时候发生了鼠疫。铁的事实恰恰是雄辩地证实这些严重的病症正是美国侵略者用人工散布的，不是在朝鲜土地上自然发生的。不管美国政府如何抵赖，事实证明，撒弥天大谎的正是美国政府自己。
    美国政府进行细菌战的野蛮行为，绝不能挽救其失败命运。
    朝鲜人民及英雄的中朝部队已高度警惕起来，在各种医药专家的努力之下，采取了坚决的措施，实施了全面而有效的预防步骤。朝鲜人民中国人民和中朝武装部队有信心像在陆地和空中击败美帝国主义一样，一定能在反细菌战的战线上，彻底击败美国侵略者的进攻。
    中朝人民知道必须取得这一胜利，否则现在中国和朝鲜人民所面对的细菌战的威胁，明天就会落在世界其他角落的人民的头上。
    中朝人民已取得了反对细菌战的第一回合的胜利。中朝人民一定会取得完全而最后的胜利。
    中朝人民现在进行着的反细菌战的战斗，是站在保卫世界人民，保卫世界和平的第一线上。
    世界人民应该大力支援中朝人民的反细菌战的战斗。
    中朝人民的胜利就是世界人民的胜利。
