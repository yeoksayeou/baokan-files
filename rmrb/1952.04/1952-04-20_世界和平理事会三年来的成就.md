Column: Propaganda Officer's Speech

    The first World Peace Congress was held simultaneously in Paris and Prague on April 20, 1949. Attending the meeting were 2,005 representatives from 72 countries. Representing more than 1,000 people's organizations and over 650 million organized people, they issued a solemn declaration to the world, calling on all people to mobilize to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression; demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and all war weapons that collectively destroy mankind, and declaring war propaganda a crime. The Congress also adopted a resolution to establish a Standing Committee (the predecessor of the current World Peace Council) and elected more than 130 representatives from 49 countries as members of the Standing Committee.

    Since this congress, the movement to defend world peace has been widely carried out in an organized and guided manner throughout the world. In November 1950, 1,756 representatives and more than 300 guests from 81 countries held the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. The Congress adopted a declaration to the people of the world and an appeal to the United Nations, suggesting that major powers reduce their armed forces, and raised important issues such as peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, opposition to the re-militarization of Germany and Japan, opposition to war propaganda, and prohibition of atomic weapons. The Congress established a new leading body for the peace movement—the World Peace Council, electing 222 council members from 60 countries; later, 72 new council members were added. The World Peace Council is the highest leading body of the world peace movement after the closing of the Congress. Under it is a standing executive bureau.

    In the past three years, thanks to the efforts of peace fighters in various countries and the leadership of the World Peace Council, the movement to defend world peace has achieved significant results. According to incomplete statistics, peace organizations in 95 countries around the world have established contact with the World Peace Council. People in more than 40 countries (including major countries such as China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India) have held one or more national peace congresses. The people of the Americas and Northern Europe have held regional international peace congresses respectively. Local peace organizations and peace conferences have spread all over the world. In many countries, organizations to defend peace have been established in all cities, large and small. Defending world peace has become a unanimous call of the people of the world, which has seriously hit the war policy of U.S. imperialism.

    Since the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism has been frantically preparing for a third world war, shamelessly engaging in war propaganda, and carrying out threats and provocations in many places. In 1949, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress suggested that October 2 of that year be designated as International Peace Day, calling on the people of the world to unite against war and organize large-scale demonstrations worldwide. Hundreds of millions of men and women in 60 countries enthusiastically responded to this call, holding rallies and demonstrations.
    The cry of "No War" shook the world. On October 2, the Chinese people established the China Peace Congress. On October 26, 1950, the China Peace Congress Committee and the Chinese People's Committee Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea merged to form the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against U.S. Aggression. The Chinese people's vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea disrupted U.S. imperialism's aggression plan and made a huge contribution to defending world peace.

    U.S. imperialism, which is frantically preparing for war, often uses atomic bombs to intimidate peace-loving people in various countries, and actively prepares to use bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, vainly attempting to dominate the world with this. In order to safeguard the safety of mankind, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress passed the famous Stockholm Appeal for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons at a meeting held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in March 1950, calling on all kind-hearted people in the world to sign this appeal. This call caused a huge response in countries all over the world. The number of signatures reached more than 500 million. Although the ruling groups of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states tried their best to obstruct this movement, the people of various countries, disregarding the persecution of reactionary governments, held rallies, parades, and signature campaigns one after another. In Italy, 17 million people signed; in France, 14 million people signed, exceeding one-third of the total population of the country. In order to carry out the will of the people of the world, the Second World Peace Congress passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other tools of mass destruction, and declaring that the government that first uses these weapons is a war criminal. Recently, U.S. imperialism has shamelessly engaged in germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Oslo, the capital of Norway, and passed a letter to men and women all over the world entitled "Against Germ Warfare," calling on the people of the world to rise up and stop the heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressors. The U.S. germ warfare criminals, intimidated by the power of the peace-loving people of the world, have so far dared not admit to conducting germ warfare, and are stubbornly playing dead, attempting to deny it. But this cannot be denied.

    After the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign, in February 1950, the World Peace Council's Berlin meeting passed a declaration demanding that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China, conclude a peace pact, and once again launched a signature campaign around the world. At the same time, it launched votes in relevant countries on the issue of opposing the re-militarization of Japan and West Germany. The scale of this movement was even greater than the last one, and the number of signatures in various countries has now reached 600,375,000.

    During this period, the World Peace Council expressed its views and took just actions on other major issues related to world peace. For example, the World Peace Council passed a resolution demanding that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to resolve their internal affairs themselves; demanding that the United Nations revoke illegal resolutions that slander our country, etc. In addition, a peace prize was established; the "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" magazine was published, with versions in eleven different languages ​​distributed worldwide.

    In order to expand the peace movement, enhance friendship between people of all countries, and improve the economic and cultural living standards of people all over the world, the World Peace Council decided to launch a series of international movements in the economic and cultural fields. For example, the World Peace Council has suggested that countries commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of French writer Hugo, the 500th anniversary of the birth of Italian artist Vinci, the 100th anniversary of the death of Russian writer Gogol, and the 1,000th anniversary of the birth of the famous Arab doctor Avicenna this year, in order to promote the concern of the cultural circles and the broad strata of people in various countries for the development of human culture. In order to improve international economic relations, the World Peace Council launched the International Economic Conference. This conference was held in Moscow in early April this year. Attending the meeting were 471 delegates from 49 countries. They fully exchanged views on improving international economic relations, reached a consensus, and established the International Trade Promotion Committee. Many countries signed trade agreements during the conference and concluded a large number of transactions. This conference once again dealt a heavy blow to the war policy of U.S. imperialism to split the world economy.

    世界和平理事会三年来的成就
    一九四九年四月二十日，第一届世界和平大会在巴黎和布拉格同时开幕。出席这次会议的，有来自七十二个国家的代表二千零五人。他们代表一千多个人民团体和六亿五千多万有组织人民，向全世界发出了庄严的声明，号召全世界人民动员起来保卫和平，反对侵略战争；要求禁止原子武器以及所有集体毁灭人类的战争武器，并宣布战争宣传是犯罪行为。大会并通过设立常设委员会（现在世界和平理事会的前身），选出了四十九个国家的一百三十多名代表为常设委员会委员。
    从这次大会以后，保卫世界和平的运动便有组织、有领导地在全世界范围内广泛开展起来。一九五○年十一月，来自八十一个国家的一千七百五十六名代表和三百多名来宾，在波兰首都华沙举行了第二届保卫世界和平大会。这次大会通过了告全世界人民的宣言与致联合国的呼吁书，建议各大国裁减军队，并提出和平解决朝鲜问题、反对德国和日本的重新军事化、反对战争宣传、禁用原子武器等重要问题。大会成立了一个新的和平运动的领导机构——世界和平理事会，选出六十个国家的理事二百二十二人；后来又补选了新理事七十二人。世界和平理事会是和大闭幕以后世界和平运动的最高领导机构。在它的下面有常设的执行局。
    三年来，在各国和平战士的努力与世界和平理事会的领导下，保卫世界和平运动获得了重大的成就。据不完全的统计，全世界已有九十五个国家的和平组织与世界和平理事会建立了联系。四十多个国家（包括中、苏、美、英、法、印度等大国）的人民都举行了一次或一次以上的全国性的保卫和平大会。美洲各国和北欧各国的人民，分别举行了区域性的国际和平大会。地方性的和平组织与和平会议，则已遍及全球。在许多国家，所有大小城市，都成立了保卫和平的组织。保卫世界和平已成为全世界人民一致的呼声，这就严重地打击了美帝国主义的战争政策。
    自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义就疯狂地准备进行第三次世界大战，无耻地进行战争宣传，并在许多地方进行威胁和挑衅。一九四九年，世界和平大会常设委员会建议以当年十月二日为国际和平日，号召全世界人民团结起来反对战争，组织全世界规模的大示威。六十个国家的数亿男女热烈响应了这一号召，纷纷举行集会和示威游行，
    “不要战争”的呼声震撼全世界。就在十月二日这一天，中国人民成立了保卫世界和平大会。一九五○年十月二十六日，中国保卫世界和平大会委员会与中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会合并，成立了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会。中国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，打乱了美帝国主义的侵略计划，对保卫世界和平作了巨大的贡献。
    疯狂地准备战争的美帝国主义，常常拿原子弹来恫吓各国的和平人民，并且积极准备使用细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭人类的武器，妄想以此称霸全世界。为了维护人类的安全，世界和平大会常设委员会一九五○年三月在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行的会议中，通过了有名的禁止原子武器的和平呼吁书，号召全世界心地善良的一切人民在这个呼吁书上签名。这一号召在全世界各国引起了巨雷似的反响。签名的人数达五亿以上。美帝国主义及其附庸国的统治集团，虽然极力阻挠这次运动，但各国人民不顾反动政府的迫害，纷纷举行集会、游行和签名。在意大利，签名的有一千七百万人；在法国，签名的有一千四百万人。都超过了全国人口的三分之一。为了执行全世界人民的意志，第二届世界和平大会通过决议，要求禁止原子武器、细菌武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具，并宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。最近，美帝国主义无耻地在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战。世界和平理事会执行局特在挪威首都奥斯陆举行会议，通过了以“反细菌战”为题的告全世界男女书，号召全世界人民起来制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行。美国细菌战犯们慑于全世界和平人民的威力，至今不敢承认进行细菌战，一味在那里耍死狗，企图抵赖。但这是赖不了的。
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动之后，一九五○年二月，世界和平理事会柏林会议又通过了要求美、英、法、苏、中五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，再次在全世界发动了签名运动。同时发动有关各国人民分别举行反对日本和西德重新军事化问题的投票。这次运动的规模比上次更加广大，各国签名人数现在已达六亿零三百七十五万人。
    在此期间，世界和平理事会对于有关世界和平的其他各项重大的问题，都表示了自己的意见和采取了正义的行动。例如，世界和平理事会曾通过决议，要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜内政；要联合国取消诬蔑我国的非法决议等。此外，还设立了和平奖金；出版了“保卫和平”杂志，有十一国不同文字的版本在全世界发行。
    为了扩大和平运动，增进各国人民之间的友谊，提高全世界人民的经济、文化生活水平，世界和平理事会决定发起一系列的经济、文化方面的国际性运动。例如，世界和平理事会曾建议各国在今年纪念法国作家雨果诞生一百五十周年，意大利艺术家芬奇诞生五百周年、俄罗斯作家果戈理逝世一百周年和阿拉伯著名医生阿维森纳诞生一千周年，以促进各国文化界和广大阶层的人民关心人类的文化的发展。为了改善国际间的经济关系，世界和平理事会发起了国际经济会议。这次会议已于今年四月初在莫斯科举行。到会的有四十九个国家的四百七十一名代表。他们充分交换了改善国际经济关系的意见，取得了一致的见解，并成立了国际贸易促进委员会。很多国家之间并在会议期间签订了贸易协定，成交了大批交易。这次会议，又一次地给了美帝国主义分裂世界经济的战争政策以沉重的打击。
