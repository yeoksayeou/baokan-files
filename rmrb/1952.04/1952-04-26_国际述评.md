The World's Working People Greet May Day

May Day is a festival of unity and struggle for the working people of the world. Under the banner of defending world peace, the working people of the world are greeting this great day with a new fighting posture.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has issued slogans for the celebration of May Day, calling on the working people of all countries to: "Consolidate the unity of the people in the struggle for peace, expand and tighten the ranks of peace supporters!" and calling on peace supporters around the world to: "Expose and smash the sinister plans of the imperialist aggressors, and prevent the warmongers from deceiving the masses and dragging the people into a new world war with lies!" The World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a "May Day Appeal to the Working People of the World," calling on the working people of the world to turn the May Day demonstrations into a powerful demonstration of the will of the working masses: demanding the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people; demanding peace based on justice and stability; demanding the immediate cessation of the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea and China, and the punishment of the war criminals responsible for these horrific crimes. The calls issued by the CPSU Central Committee and the World Federation of Trade Unions for the celebration of May Day clearly point out the direction of efforts in the movement to defend peace for the working people of all countries and peace-loving people around the world. The working people of all countries and all peace-loving people will surely respond to this resounding call, strengthen their ranks, and widely launch a struggle to defend peace and combat imperialist aggression plans to celebrate this great festival.

In our country, the Soviet Union, and the people's democracies, the working people are engaged in selfless labor and production competitions, greeting their festival with new production achievements. In our country, many state-owned factories have completed or overfulfilled their first-quarter production plans for 1952 on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. The Soviet working people have already begun a socialist competition aimed at completing the 1952 production plan ahead of schedule. They have overfulfilled the first-quarter production plan for 1952, increasing total industrial output by 16 percent compared with the same period last year. The brilliant achievements of the working people in the peaceful democratic countries on the production front give tremendous encouragement to the working people of the world and make an important contribution to the defense of world peace.

The working people in capitalist countries, colonial countries, and dependent countries are fighting against imperialist war plans and for their own economic interests and social rights. The recent large-scale strikes by one million workers in Japan against the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," and the large-scale strike by 100,000 telecommunications workers in the United States demanding wage increases, are vivid manifestations of the working people's will to struggle. In the struggle for democratic peace and national independence, the working people in capitalist countries, colonial countries, and dependent countries have expanded and strengthened the unity of the people, becoming a great force for defending world peace.

Unite All Men and Women Worldwide Against Germ Warfare

The World Peace Council Executive Bureau's call in Oslo to all men and women worldwide against germ warfare has become the action program for the current peace movement. Various international conferences and people's organizations representing the will for peace of millions of people in various countries have issued calls, appealing to the people of all countries to unite closely against germ warfare, demanding the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, and denouncing the American bacteriological war criminals who are massacring humanity on a large scale.

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers, which sent an investigation team to Korea to investigate the atrocities committed by the U.S. military, held a council meeting in Vienna from April 16 to 20. After discussing the investigation team's "Investigation Report on War Crimes Committed by U.S. Troops in Korea and the Use of Bacteriological Weapons in Korea and China," the meeting unanimously passed a resolution on the report, as well as important documents such as an open letter to legal professionals around the world, a letter to the United Nations Security Council, and a letter to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. The resolution of the Council meeting called on the people of the world to unanimously use the power of public opinion to demand – especially to the parliaments and governments of all countries and to various agencies of the United Nations – 1. an immediate end to germ warfare and preparations for germ warfare; 2. the punishment of criminals who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity; 3. effective prohibition of weapons of mass destruction such as biological weapons, chemical weapons, and atomic weapons.

The International Conference for the Protection of Children, held in Vienna from April 12 to 16, passed a "Message to the Men and Women of the World" at its final meeting, especially appealing to the United Nations Disarmament Commission: demanding the reduction of the unlimitedly inflated military budget and the use of such funds to meet the needs of children; denouncing the towering crime of massacring children on a large scale; demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Demanding that all countries in the world sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning germ warfare.

In addition, Madame Eugenie Cotton, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which has 135 million members, wrote to democratic women's organizations in all countries on March 26, calling on women around the world to take immediate action against the crime of U.S. imperialism in conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. The Chemical Workers International, which has two million members, also issued a "Message to Chemical Workers Around the World," calling on workers around the world to participate in the protest movement against germ warfare. The 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain adopted an emergency resolution at its April 14 meeting, calling for the launch of the broadest protest movement to stop the crime of germ warfare being carried out by American aggressors in Korea and China.

The worldwide protest movement against germ warfare has caused extreme panic among American germ warfare criminals. They are shamelessly denying their crimes of conducting germ warfare, and persecuting peace fighters who resolutely oppose germ warfare. The shameful act of the United States instructing the Austrian government to persecute Brandweiner, head of the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, has aroused the anger of just people in all countries. This arrogant and shameless tactic of the American aggressors not only cannot cover up their towering crime of exterminating humanity, but on the contrary, makes this crime more manifest in the eyes of the people of the world, and makes the people of all countries more determined to carry out unremitting struggle to stop germ warfare.

The United States Continues to Suffer Defeats in Korea

Recently, the shameless conspiracies of the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield and in the Korean armistice negotiations have continued to suffer a disgraceful defeat.

In February and March, the heroic Korean-Chinese People's Army fought bravely on the Korean front, repelling more than 150 enemy advances, eliminating a total of more than 12,500 enemy troops, and destroying or damaging 642 enemy aircraft. The Korean people and the Korean-Chinese People's Army have also formed an anti-epidemic army against U.S. germ warfare, extinguishing the poisonous insects dropped by U.S. air bandits, and effectively controlling the epidemic, and have achieved great victories on the anti-germ warfare front. The new victories of the Korean-Chinese People's Army and the Korean people have once again dealt a serious blow to the American aggressors who are trying to make a final struggle on the Korean battlefield, and have further strengthened the confidence of peace-loving people around the world in defending peace and stopping aggressive wars.

The American aggressors, disregarding their heavy defeats on the Korean front, continue to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations. On April 19, we suggested reconvening the staff meeting of the third agenda item to try to resolve all the remaining issues of the third agenda item. The meeting was reconvened on the 20th, but it did not make any progress because the U.S. side continued to insist on unreasonable demands for restrictions on airport equipment in Korea; because the U.S. side attempted to change the six neutral countries that make up the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to four, in order to exclude the Soviet Union from the nominations proposed by us, which fully meet the definition of neutral countries.

The staff meeting of the fourth agenda item, after a two-week recess, resumed on April 19. However, on the first day of the resumption of the administrative meeting, the U.S. side illegally disclosed the content of the administrative meeting through the Associated Press, attempting to carry out deceptive propaganda for its absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation." In a dispatch from Panmunjom on April 19, the Associated Press openly promoted that the U.S. side would "delete the names of prisoners of war who do not wish to be repatriated" from the list of December 18 last year, in order to transform and detain our captured personnel through a disguised means. Even from the one-sided propaganda carried out by the U.S. side, it is not difficult to see that the U.S. side is still insisting on its unreasonable demand for "voluntary repatriation."

The U.S. aggressors have been insisting on their absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation" on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, the purpose of which is to forcibly detain our captured personnel, send them to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and the Li Chengwan bandit gang for persecution and massacre, or drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. to expand the war of aggression. Some U.S. news agencies, newspapers and U.S. airborne special agents have confessed that the U.S. aggressors used Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to carry out sinister activities in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, brutally tattooing our captured personnel, and forcing them to sign blood letters. As the reporter of "Tonight's News" said: "This can only be regarded as the most serious provocation by the U.S. side at a delicate stage of the negotiations." This will surely arouse greater anger among the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.

The current situation in the Korean War shows that the U.S. aggressors will never be able to change their plight of becoming more and more trapped in the Korean battlefield. Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has asserted in a recent speech: "Any vicious trick of the U.S. aggressors cannot change the established ending of their final defeat."

    国际述评
    全世界劳动人民迎接“五一”节
    五一节是全世界劳动人民团结的战斗的节日。全世界劳动人民在保卫世界和平的旗帜下，正以新的战斗姿态迎接这个伟大的日子。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会发布了庆祝五一节的口号，号召一切国家的劳动人民：“巩固人民为和平而斗争的团结，扩大并紧密和平拥护者的队伍！”号召全世界的和平拥护者：“揭露并粉碎帝国主义侵略者的罪恶计划，防止战争贩子用谎言欺骗人民大众而把人民拖入新的世界大战！”世界工会联合会发表了“五一节告世界劳动人民书”，号召全世界劳动人民把五一节示威游行变成劳动群众意志的强大示威：要求不断提高劳动人民的生活水准；要求在公正和稳固的基础上建立的和平，要求马上制止美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，惩办对这些可怖罪行负责的战争罪犯。联共中央和世界工联为庆祝五一节发出的号召，给一切国家的劳动人民和全世界的和平拥护者明确地指出了在保卫和平运动中努力的方向。全世界劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民，必将响应这响亮的号召，加强团结自己的队伍，广泛展开保卫和平、打击帝国主义侵略计划的斗争，来庆祝这个伟大的节日。
    在我国，苏联和各人民民主国家的劳动人民，正以忘我的劳动从事生产竞赛，以新的生产成就来迎接自己的节日。我国许多国营工厂在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，已完成或超额完成了一九五二年第一季的生产计划。苏联劳动人民早已开始了以提前完成一九五二年生产计划为目标的社会主义竞赛。他们已超额完成了一九五二年第一季生产计划，使工业总产量较去年同期增加了百分之十六。和平民主国家劳动人民在生产战线上所获得的辉煌成就，给予全世界劳动人民以巨大的鼓舞，对保卫世界和平作了重要的贡献。
    资本主义国家、殖民地国家和附属国的劳动人民，正为反对帝国主义战争计划，争取他们切身的经济利益和社会权利而进行着斗争。最近日本一百万工人反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”的大罢工，美国十万电讯工人要求增加工资的大罢工，就是劳动人民斗争意志的生动表现。资本主义国家、殖民地国家和附庸国的劳动人民在争取民主和平，争取民族独立的战斗中，已使人民的团结更加扩大与加强，成为保卫世界和平的巨大力量。
    团结全世界男女反对细菌战
    世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议向全世界男女发出的反对细菌战的号召，已成为当前保卫和平运动的行动纲领。代表世界各国千百万人民和平意志的各种国际会议和人民团体，纷纷发出号召，呼吁各国人民紧密团结起来反对细菌战，要求禁止细菌武器，并声讨大批屠杀人类的美国细菌战罪犯。
    曾派遣调查团到朝鲜调查美军暴行的国际民主法律工作者协会，于四月十六日至二十日在维也纳举行了理事会会议。会议在讨论了调查团“关于美国军队在朝鲜所犯战争罪行以及在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的调查报告”以后，一致通过了关于这个报告的决议，以及告世界法律工作者书、致联合国安全理事会书和致联合国裁减军备委员会书等重要文件。理事会会议的决议号召全世界人民一致运用舆论的力量，要求——特别向各国议会和政府以及联合国各种机构要求——一、立即停止细菌战和细菌战的准备工作；二、惩办犯有战争罪行和违反人道的罪行的罪犯们；三、有效地禁止生物武器、化学武器、原子武器等大批屠杀的武器。
    于四月十二日至十六日在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会，在末次会议上通过了“告世界男女书”，特别向联合国裁减军备委员会呼吁：要求削减无限制膨胀的军事预算，把这种款项用来满足儿童的需要；声讨大批屠杀儿童的滔天罪行；要求禁止大批屠杀人类的武器。要求世界各国签署禁止细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
    此外，拥有一亿三千五百万会员的国际民主妇女联合会的总书记古久里夫人，于三月二十六日写信给各国民主妇女组织，号召全世界妇女对美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行立即采取行动。拥有二百万会员的化学工人国际也发表了“告全世界化学工人书”，号召全世界工人一致参加反对细菌战的抗议运动。英国共产党第二十二届代表大会于四月十四日会议上通过了紧急决议，号召发起最广泛的抗议运动，制止美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战罪行。
    全世界人民反对细菌战的抗议运动，已使美国细菌战罪犯们感到极端恐慌。他们一面无耻抵赖他们进行细菌战的罪行，一面对坚决反对细菌战的和平战士进行迫害。最近美国授意奥地利政府迫害国际民主法律工作者调查团团长布兰德魏纳的可耻行为，已引起各国正义人民的愤怒。美国侵略者这种蛮横无耻的手段非但不能掩盖它的灭绝人性的滔天罪行，相反的，却使它的这种罪行在全世界人民面前更加昭彰，而使各国人民更加坚决地为制止细菌战而进行不懈的斗争。
    美国在朝鲜继续遭到失败
    最近一个时期，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜停战谈判中所耍弄的无耻阴谋继续遭到了可耻的失败。
    在二、三两个月里，英勇的朝中人民军队在朝鲜前线奋勇地打退了敌人一百五十多次的进犯，共计歼灭敌人一万二千五百多名，击毁击伤敌军飞机六百四十二架。朝鲜人民和朝中人民军队并组成一支反对美国细菌战的防疫大军，扑灭了美国空中强盗撒下的毒虫，有效地控制了疫病，已在反细菌战线上取得了伟大的胜利。朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民的新的胜利，又一次给予妄图在朝鲜战场上作最后挣扎的美国侵略者以严重的打击，更加坚定了全世界爱好和平人民保卫和平制止侵略战争的信心。
    美国侵略者不顾在朝鲜前线的惨重失败，仍继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判。四月十九日，我方建议重行召开第三项议程参谋会议，来尝试解决第三项议程的一切剩余问题。会议在二十日重行召开后，由于美方继续坚持限制朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求；由于美方企图将组成中立国监察委员会的六个中立国家改作四个，来排除我方所提出的完全合乎中立国定义的提名中的苏联；而使会议没有任何进展。
    第四项议程参谋会议在休会两周后，已于四月十九日复会。然而在行政性会议复会的第一天，美方竟又通过合众社，非法泄露行政会议的内容，妄图为其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张进行欺骗宣传。合众社在板门店四月十九日的电讯中，公开宣传美方将从去年十二月十八日的名单中“把不愿遣返的战俘名字删去”，来变相地扣留我方被俘人员的可耻阴谋。即使从美方进行的片面宣传中，人们也不难看出，美方依旧在坚持其“自愿遣返”的无理要求。
    美国侵略者在交换俘虏问题上一直坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，其目的就是企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员，送交台湾国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮，供其迫害和屠杀，或驱使他们充当美国扩大侵略战争的炮灰。美国的一些通讯社、报刊和美军空降特务，都招供了美国侵略者利用蒋匪特务在美方俘虏营中进行罪恶的活动，残暴地在我方被俘人员身上刺字，并强迫他们签写血书。正如“今晚报”记者所说的：“这只能认为是美方在谈判进入微妙阶段时的一个最严重的挑衅。”这必将激起中朝人民和全世界人民的更大的愤怒。
    目前朝鲜战争的形势表明，美国侵略者决无法改变其在朝鲜战场上越陷越深的困境。中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀在最近的一次讲话中已经断言：“美国侵略军任何恶毒伎俩，丝毫不能改变其最后失败的既定结局。”
