Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: While the "Five-Anti" struggle victoriously unfolds, the Shanghai Municipality People's Government has also achieved remarkable successes in financial and economic work. Since March, the People's Government has expanded purchasing, ordering, processing, and lending activities to help private industry and commerce overcome the difficulties of the off-season and began preparing for the large quantities of industrial products needed for the upcoming peak season. Because the spirit of eliminating the "five evils" was implemented when signing contracts with private industry and commerce, the listed prices of over ten thousand industrial products in Shanghai have been reasonably reduced. At the same time, Shanghai's tax revenue work in March also victoriously exceeded the original plan. These facts vividly demonstrate that Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle is successfully integrated with production and clearly shows that the "Five-Anti" struggle is paving the way for developing production and prospering the economy.

Traditionally, Shanghai's industry and commerce enters a slow season from February each year. Based on last year's experience, when the lack of timely processing, ordering, and purchasing during the off-season led to insufficient supply of certain industrial products during the peak sales season after autumn, the People's Government, at the end of February, even though various state-owned economic departments were still conducting the "Three-Anti" movement internally, extracted key business personnel to strengthen purchasing, ordering, processing, and lending activities. In March alone, the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth, department store, industrial equipment, and other fourteen companies invested more than two and a half times the amount of the same month last year and more than 22 percent of the amount invested in February this year in purchasing, ordering, and processing from Shanghai's private industry. The balance of loans from the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China to private industrial and commercial enterprises at the end of March exceeded 5 percent of that at the end of February, more than two and a half times the same month last year. More than 5,000 private factories received purchasing, ordering, processing, and loans from state-owned trading departments and the People's Bank, including the Mei Lin Canned Food Factory, Hua Xin Stationery and Instrument Factory, etc., which were inspected in the first battle of the "Five-Anti" movement. Various state-owned economic departments have decided to further expand processing, ordering, and purchasing operations in April. At the same time, the "Three-Anti" movement in economic departments across the country is coming to an end, and procurement agencies in Shanghai will resume business. Therefore, purchasing, ordering, and processing in April will greatly exceed March. The People's Government's clear policy of taking care of production during the "Five-Anti" struggle has been warmly supported by the vast number of workers and industrialists. The awareness and production enthusiasm of the working class have been greatly improved. The production of the cotton textile industry, which accounts for the largest proportion of Shanghai's industry, has been maintained normally. Qixin Yarn Factory, an illegal household inspected in the first battle of the "Five-Anti", increased the average daily yarn production per spindle from 1.06 pounds to 2.061 pounds during the inspection process. The work efficiency of Dahua Paper Cutting Factory increased by 5 percent. The expansion of purchasing, ordering, and processing business by state-owned trade departments, the maintenance of production by private industrial and commercial enterprises with the help of the government, and the improvement of the working class's enthusiasm for production have laid a favorable foundation for the supply of materials when the peak sales season arrives.

The purchasing, ordering, and processing work of various state-owned economic departments with private enterprises that began in March was carried out in the spirit of eliminating the five poisons. Some private manufacturers have confessed in the "Five-Anti" struggle that they were unreasonable in calculating costs and prices in the past, and initially reduced their processing rates, cost standards, and finished product prices. For example, private yarn factories in Shanghai used to value the returning flower spun portion at the price of raw cotton and requested the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company to use it as the basis for calculating the unified purchase price. Now they have admitted that this request is unreasonable and agreed to calculate it at the returning flower price. For the processing of 21s and 23s fine cloth and the conversion rate of one piece of yarn, the factory used to recognize only 35.92 pieces, but now it recognizes 36.17 pieces. The processing fee for dyeing cloth has also been initially reduced by 10.5 percent. At present, the listed price of cotton yarn has not changed, while the price of cotton knitwear has dropped by 5 to 7 percent. The prices of other daily necessities have also generally dropped by 5 to 20 percent. The prices of rubber, enamel, and steel products have dropped by 5 to 10 percent. Paper prices have dropped by 6 to 12 percent. The contract price this time has generally been calculated reasonably after the state-owned company cooperated with the trade union to investigate and study and initially compared the costs. For example, the Tongming Electric Appliance Factory, which used to have huge profits, declared a cost that was 12 percent lower than in the past after the "Five-Anti" struggle was launched. The state-owned department store carefully reviewed it in cooperation with the factory's workers and found that the raw materials, labor, and sales management expenses were still falsely reported by an average of 19 percent. However, the factory's loss of raw materials was not included in the cost. After the department store included this expense rate in the cost, the review result was that the cost of each dozen flashlights was 163,000 yuan. Now the factory's investors have voluntarily reduced the cost of each dozen from the 183,000 yuan initially declared to 165,400 yuan. There are also a few capitalists who compete with each other in the state-owned company's acquisition. For example, some sell men's double-sided satin striped handkerchiefs from the original price of 5,000 yuan to 4,100 yuan. After research, the department store plans to slightly increase it. According to statistics from the East China District Company of the State-owned Department Store, the prices of more than 10,000 commodities (accounting for 90 percent of all purchased varieties) that the company recently acquired in Shanghai have dropped by an average of about 10 percent. The difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products has begun to shrink reasonably. This is good news for the vast number of farmers who are now enthusiastically launching a large-scale bumper harvest competition. At the same time, the strong purchasing power of farmers after the bumper harvest will also greatly benefit the development of legitimate industry and commerce.

Shanghai's tax revenue work in March also achieved a great victory. According to statistics at the end of the month, it has completed 105 percent of the original planned amount for March. The main part of the tax revenue in March was the 1951 business income tax. Due to the general improvement of Shanghai's industry and commerce last year with the support of the People's Government, the total amount of the 1951 income tax actually collected in March plus other actual tax revenues in March exceeded the highest monthly record of tax revenues since the liberation of Shanghai by more than 80 percent. The victory of tax revenue work in March is mainly due to the government's expansion of purchasing, ordering, processing, and loan business to private industry and commerce, and the total amount invested exceeded the amount of tax revenue, which greatly helped the turnover of funds for private industrial and commercial enterprises. At the same time, since the start of the "Five-Anti" struggle, Shanghai's private industrial and commercial enterprises have also improved their understanding of national tax revenue under the education and supervision of the government and the vast number of people.

    反盗窃斗争同生产密切结合
    上海三月份财经工作获显著成就
    万多种工业品价格合理降低税收超过计划
    【新华社上海七日电】上海市在“五反”斗争胜利展开的同时，人民政府在财经工作方面也获得了显著的成就。自三月份起，人民政府扩大了收购、定货、加工和贷款工作，帮助私营工商业克服淡季生产的困难，开始准备了今后旺季所需的大量工业品。由于在和私营工商业签订合同时贯彻去除五毒的精神，上海市已有一万多种工业品的牌价合理地降低了；同时，上海市三月份的税收工作也胜利地超过了原订的计划。这些，都生动地证明了上海市的“五反”斗争成功地结合着生产，鲜明地显示了“五反”斗争正是为发展生产，繁荣经济铺平道路。
    历来每年二月份起，上海工商业开始进入产销淡季。人民政府根据去年由于淡季时没有及时地大量加工、定货、收购，以致秋后旺销时某些工业品供不应求的经验，今年二月底，虽然各国营经济部门尚在内部进行“三反”运动，就抽出了主要业务工作人员，加强了收购、定货、加工和贷款工作。仅国营花纱布、百货、工业器材等十四个公司，三月份对上海市私营工业收购、定货、加工投放的金额，就有去年同月的两倍半以上，超过今年二月份投放金额的百分之二十二。中国人民银行上海分行对私营工商业户三月底的贷款余额，超过二月底时的百分之五，就有去年同月的两倍半以上。得到国营贸易部门和人民银行收购、定货、加工和贷款的私营工厂达五千多户，其中如“五反”运动第一战役中受检查的梅林罐头食品厂、华新文具仪器厂等也得到了照顾。四月份各国营经济部门的加工、定货、收购业务已决定进一步地加以扩大，同时全国各地经济部门的“三反”运动告一段落，各地在上海的采购机构也就要恢复业务。因此，四月份的收购、定货和加工等将大大超过三月份。人民政府在“五反”斗争中鲜明地照顾生产的政策，受到广大职工和工商业者的热烈拥护，工人阶级的觉悟和生产积极性大大提高。上海市比重最大的棉纺工业的生产一直维持正常，“五反”第一个战役中受检查的违法户启新纱厂在检查过程中，每个纱锭每天平均产纱量由一点零六磅提高到二点零六一磅，大华切纸厂工作效率提高了百分之五。国营贸易部门的扩大收购、定货、加工业务，以及私营工商业在政府帮助下维持生产，工人阶级生产积极性的提高，对今后销售旺季到来时的物资供应工作，已打下了有利的基础。
    三月份开始的各国营经济部门对私营企业的收购、定货、加工工作，是在去除五毒的精神下进行的。一部分私营厂商已在“五反”斗争中坦白了自己过去在计算成本和价格上的不合理，初步降低了他们的加工费率、成本标准和成品价格。如上海私营纱厂过去把回花搭纺部分仍照原棉作价，要国营花纱布公司作为统购价的计算根据，现在他们已承认这种要求不合理，同意按回花价格计算。二十一支、二十三支细布加工和一件纱的折合率，厂方过去只承认三五点九二匹，现在承认三六点一七匹。染布的工缴费也初步降低了百分之十点五。目前棉纱牌价未变，而棉针织品价格下降百分之五至百分之七。其他日用品价格一般也下降了百分之五至百分之二十。橡胶、搪瓷、钢精制品价格下降百分之五至百分之十。纸类价格下降百分之六至百分之十二。这次签订合同核定价格，一般都经过国营公司配合工会调查研究，初步比较合理地计算了成本。如过去暴利很大的通明电器厂，在“五反”斗争开展以后申报的成本，比过去下降百分之十二。国营百货公司配合该厂工人慎重审核，发现原物料、人工及推销管理费用上仍平均虚报百分之十九，但该厂原物料之损耗未计入成本之内，百货公司将该项费率计入成本后，审核结果，每打手电筒成本为十六万三千元。现该厂资方已将第一次申报的成本每打十八万三千元自动降到十六万五千四百元。也有少数资本家在国营公司收购时，同业互相倾轧，如有的将男用双面缎条手帕，由原价五千元降至四千一百元出售。百货公司研究后，拟略予调升。根据国营百货公司华东区公司的统计，该公司最近在上海收购的各项百货中，已有一万多种商品（占全部收购品种的百分之九十）的价格平均下降百分之十左右。工农业产品价格的差额，已开始合理地缩小。这对目前正在热烈开展大规模丰产竞赛运动的广大农民，是可喜的消息。同时，农民在丰产后的旺盛购买力，也将大大有利于正当工商业的发展。
    三月份上海市的税收工作，也取得了巨大胜利，截至月底的统计，已完成了三月份原订入库计划的百分之一百零五。三月份入库税款的主要部分是一九五一年营利事业所得税。由于上海工商业去年在人民政府扶助下普遍好转，三月份实收的一九五一年所得税加三月份其他各项实收税款，总额超过了上海解放以来每月最高入库纪录的百分之八十以上。三月份税收工作的胜利，主要由于政府对私营工商业扩大了收购、定货、加工和贷款业务，投放的总金额超过税收的收入金额，大大帮助了私营工商业户的资金周转。同时，自“五反”斗争开始以来，上海私营工商业户在政府和广大人民的教育和督促下，对国家税收的认识也提高了一步。
