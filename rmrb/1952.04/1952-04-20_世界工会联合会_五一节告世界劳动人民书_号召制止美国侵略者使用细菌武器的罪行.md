Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 19th: TASS, Vienna, 18th: The World Federation of Trade Unions issued the following May Day message to the working people of the world:

    "On the occasion of May Day, the World Federation of Trade Unions extends brotherly greetings to you.
    May Day is the international day of solidarity for working people and the unity of people all over the world.
    Working people in all countries of the world, turn the May Day demonstrations into powerful demonstrations of the will of the working masses.
    Unite your ranks to express this will more forcefully.
    The working people of the world have a common goal to strive for.
    They demand a continuous improvement in their living standards; they demand peace, and peace established on a just and solid foundation; they demand an immediate halt to the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. armed forces in Korea and China, and the immediate punishment of the war criminals responsible for these terrible crimes.
    The working people of the world resolutely oppose the colonial system and all oppression—the foundation of the colonial system.
    They demand mutual assistance and love among all working people around the world, and solidarity among all trade unions around the world.
    They advocate the peaceful coexistence of countries with different political, economic, and social systems.
    The working people of capitalist countries, semi-colonial and colonial countries, are strengthening their struggle to achieve this common goal.
    They are fighting for their vital economic demands, for the satisfaction of their vital demands, against the consequences of the war preparations forced upon their countries by U.S. imperialists and monopoly capitalists, and to defend their democratic and trade union rights.
    They are fighting for national independence and for the elimination of the colonial system.
    In all these countries, the working people, in their struggle against poverty and the complete absence of social rights, hope to receive constant assistance from trade unions.
    In the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic, the working people are promoting the economic and social progress of their countries with their selfless labor.
    The people of these countries are masters of their own destiny, and their brilliant achievements are a great contribution to strengthening world peace. Their continuous achievements in social and cultural progress inspire the working people of the whole world.
    Working people of the world! In the struggle to achieve your economic and social demands, in the struggle to defend your trade union rights, strengthen and expand your solidarity!
    Where there are splitters, expose them and isolate them! Act bravely and defend peace, which is in danger!
    Demand the punishment of war criminals!
    Strengthen the international solidarity of workers, and strengthen the national and international solidarity of the working class!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Long live May Day!"

    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社维也纳十八日讯：世界工会联合会发表五一节告全世界劳动人民书如下：
    “值此五一节之际，世界工会联合会特向你们致兄弟的祝贺。
    五一节是劳动人民团结和全世界人民同心一德的国际节日。
    全世界各国的劳动人民，把五一节示威游行变成劳动群众意志的强大示威。
    团结你们的队伍，以更有力地表现这种意志。
    全世界的劳动人民有一个共同奋斗的目标。
    他们要求不断提高他们的生活水准；要求和平，而且是在公正和稳固的基础上建立的和平；要求马上制止美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用的细菌武器，马上惩办应对这些可怖罪行负责的战争罪犯。
    全世界劳动人民坚决反对殖民制度和一切压迫——殖民制度的基础。
    他们要求全世界一切劳动人民互助友爱，全世界一切工会团结一致。
    他们主张具有不同的政治、经济和社会制度的国家和平共存。
    资本主义国家、半殖民地和殖民地国家的劳动人民，正在为争取达到这个共同的目标而加强他们的斗争。
    他们正在战斗，争取他们切身的经济要求，争取他们切身的要求得到满足，反对美国帝国主义者和垄断资本家强迫他们本国进行的战争准备所造成的后果，保卫他们的民主权利和工会权利。
    他们正在为民族独立，为消灭殖民制度而战斗。
    在这一切国家里，劳动人民在反抗贫困和完全没有社会权利境况的斗争中，希望得到工会经常的援助。
    在苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国，劳动人民正以他们忘我的劳动，来促进他们国家的经济和社会进步。
    这些国家的人民都是自己命运的主宰者，他们所取得的辉煌成就，是对加强世界和平的巨大贡献。他们在社会和文化进步方面不断取得的成就，鼓舞了全世界的劳动人民。
    全世界的劳动人民！在争取实现你们的经济要求和社会要求的斗争中，在保卫你们的工会权利的斗争中，加强和扩大你们的团结！
    那里有分裂者，就在那里揭发他们，孤立他们！勇敢地行动，保卫处在危险中的和平！
    要求惩办战争罪犯！
    加强工人的国际团结，加强工人阶级的全国团结和国际团结！
    世界工会联合会万岁！
    五一节万岁！”
