Xinhua News Agency, 20th: As a result of pursuing a policy of foreign expansion and plunder, the United States is encountering increasing opposition everywhere in the world. Even in Latin America, which is under its direct and forceful control, anti-American sentiment is developing further. "U.S. News & World Report," one of the magazines of major US corporations, recently expressed deep concern about this fact.

The magazine, in an article on the situation in Latin America published on March 7th, sounded the alarm, saying, "While Washington concentrates its forces on fighting communism in Europe and Asia (note: actually, "carrying out aggression"), trouble is increasing in America's backyard."

The magazine described one by one the current "greatest pain points" for the United States in Latin America. In Mexico, the Communist Party's call to defend Mexican sovereignty and oppose the conclusion of enslaving military agreements with the United States "has won the sympathy of millions of Mexicans who distrust the United States because of the 1846-47 war (referring to the Mexican-American War, as a result of this war of expansion, the United States seized large tracts of land that previously belonged to Mexico and now constitute the southwestern states of the United States) and Mexico's loss of territory. The pressure became so great that negotiations finally broke down." In Guatemala, "organized labor" under the leadership of the Communist Party is "making trouble for foreign companies (mainly the 'United Fruit Company', one of the major US trusts)." In Cuba, popular opposition "recently caused the government to change its original intention to send troops to Korea." In Panama, "anti-American sentiment is on the rise. ... Many Panamanians do not like the United States controlling the (Panama) Canal Zone." In Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia, things are becoming increasingly unfavorable for US monopoly capital. The general awakening of the people of these countries makes this mouthpiece of major US corporations extremely uneasy about the political trends in these countries. It summarized the increasingly strong opposition to the United States in Latin America with a sorrowful tone, saying, "The United States is far less popular than it was five years ago."

The publication anxiously pointed out: "These pain points appear in a region that provides the United States with one-third of its imports, including certain important strategic materials. In this region, US direct investment is more than $5 billion, exceeding US investment in the entire Eastern Hemisphere."

The publication summarized its unease about this situation in its editorial:

"This is a situation that threatens US investment and trade. If things continue to deteriorate, the United States will no longer have any 'Good Neighbors'."

    拉丁美洲人民不满美国掠夺政策
    反美情绪进一步发展
    【新华社二十日讯】由于推行对外扩张和掠夺政策的结果，美国在世界各处遭到愈来愈多的反对，甚至在它直接和强力控制下的拉丁美洲，反美情绪也在进一步地发展中。美国大企业的杂志之一“美国新闻与世界报道”最近对这个事实表示深为忧虑。
    三月七日出版的这份杂志在一篇关于拉丁美洲形势的文章中发出警号说：“当华盛顿集中力量在欧洲和亚洲对共产主义斗争（按：实际是“进行侵略”）时，就在美国的后院，麻烦正在增加。”
    该杂志逐一叙述了美国在拉丁美洲目前的“最大的痛处”。在墨西哥，共产党提出的保卫墨西哥主权、反对与美国成立奴役性军事协定的号召，“博得成百万由于一八四六—四七年战争（按指美墨战争，由于这次扩张战争的结果，美国攫取了从前属于墨西哥、现在构成美国西南各州的大片土地。）和墨西哥丧失领土而不信任美国的墨西哥人的同情。压力变得这样大，以至谈判终于中断。”在危地马拉，共产党领导下的“有组织的劳工正在为外国公司（按主要是美国大托辣斯之一“美国水果公司”）制造麻烦”。在古巴，人民的反对“最近使政府改变了派军队去朝鲜的原意”。在巴拿马，“反美情绪在高涨。……许多巴拿马人不喜欢美国控制着（巴拿马）运河区。”在智利，阿根廷，巴西，哥伦比亚，玻利维亚，事情对美国的垄断资本也愈来愈不顺利。这些国家人民普遍觉醒的情形，使这个美国大企业的喉舌对于这些国家政治的趋势表示极大的不安。它用悲哀的口气归纳美国在拉丁美洲遭到日益加强的反对的情形说：“美国已远不如五年前受欢迎。”
    该刊焦急地指出：“这些痛处出现在这样一个地区，这个地区提供美国入口的三分之一，包括某些重要战略物资。在这个地区，美国的直接投资在五十亿美元以上，超过美国对整个东半球的投资。”
    该刊在它的导语中对这种形势概括了它的不安：
    “这是一个威胁着美国投资和贸易的形势。如果事情继续恶化，美国会再没有什么‘好邻居’了。”
