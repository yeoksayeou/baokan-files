    Beijing Municipal Units Establish People's Tribunals to Hear Embezzlement Cases
    Municipal Court Establishes Fifteen Temporary Divisions by System to Lead the Work of the People's Tribunals

    [This newspaper reports] In accordance with the State Council's regulations, and with the approval of the Municipal People's Government, units such as Beijing's agencies, organizations, schools, and state-owned enterprises have established 116 People's Tribunals. These tribunals have begun to review and handle embezzlement cases uncovered in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. To facilitate the leadership of the work of the People's Tribunals and to swiftly handle all cases, the Beijing Municipal People's Court has also established fifteen temporary divisions based on party and group, directly subordinate units of the Municipal People's Government, finance and economy, politics and law, culture and education, municipal construction, Public Security Bureau, banks, Industry and Commerce Bureau, large factories, Railway Branch Bureau, universities, inner city districts, outer city districts, and suburban districts. A joint office of the divisions has also been established to refer to and research the cases they accept, striving to avoid the phenomenon of being too lenient, too severe, or hastily concluding cases.
    The Municipal People's Court, the Procuratorate, the People's Supervisory Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and the joint office of the temporary divisions have jointly organized inspection teams to inspect the work of the People's Tribunals in a planned manner. The temporary divisions have also organized inspection teams to separately inspect the work of the People's Tribunals in their respective systems.
