A Brief Commentary on Economic Life

Some leading cadres in factories and mines believe that the "Three-Anti" movement is over after the anti-corruption struggle has been carried out. They think, "The big storm of anti-corruption has passed; waste is only a small problem and does not require much effort." The reason for this idea is mainly the lack of sufficient understanding of the seriousness of waste. This thinking must be corrected.

Although the large-scale anti-corruption struggle in factories and mines is nearing its end, it cannot be considered that the "Three-Anti" movement is about to end. In addition to organizing a special team to pursue unfinished cases to the end, we must continue to carry out the struggle against waste and bureaucracy to fully implement the "Three-Anti" movement to the end. We cannot stop after carrying out only "One-Anti." Most factories and mines have cadres with bureaucracy and waste problems who did not conduct self-criticism in the early stage of the "Three-Anti" movement or only made preliminary self-criticisms, and they must conduct supplementary self-criticism. Many factories and mines have not seriously inspected the waste phenomena existing in enterprise management, capital construction, and production processes. Some factories and mines, although they have conducted inspections, the scope of the inspections is limited to personal extravagance and waste. Although the nature of waste in production and management is different from corruption, the losses it causes to the country and the people are also very serious. To take a small example, according to preliminary statistics, the waste in nine small and medium-sized factories in Zhangjiakou in the past three years was 102.2 billion yuan (including stockpiled funds). Can these wasteful phenomena be ignored?

Units where the anti-corruption struggle has been basically thorough, if the inspection of anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy is not thorough, should conduct make-up lessons in the short term. Leading cadres and employees of various departments, workshops, and groups should participate in checking what wastes exist in production and management, the causes of waste, and the responsibilities. In addition to educating cadres and the masses with specific examples, the leadership should also, based on the problems discovered in the "Three-Anti" movement, establish and improve the planning and statistics system, the responsibility system, the inspection system, the warehouse management and material requisitioning and returning system, as well as the personnel system and democratic management system, through mass democratic discussion, to further consolidate the victorious achievements of the movement.

### 反浪费不彻底的工矿企业应补行反浪费的检查

    反浪费不彻底的工矿企业应补行反浪费的检查
    有些厂矿的领导干部，在进行了反贪污斗争以后，就认为“三反”运动已经完了。他们认为：“反贪污大风大浪已经过去；浪费只是小问题，不用费多大劲了。”产生这种想法的原因，主要是对浪费的严重性缺乏足够的认识。这种思想必须纠正。
    厂矿中的大规模的反贪污斗争虽然已将接近结束，但不能认为“三反”运动就要结束了。除了组织专门的队伍对未了案件一直追到底之外，还必须继续进行反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，把“三反”运动全面贯彻到底，不能只进行“一反”就停止了。大部分厂矿有官僚主义和浪费的毛病的干部在“三反”运动初期没有进行检讨或只初步作了检讨的，还必须补作检讨。许多厂矿对企业管理、基本建设和生产过程中存在的浪费现象，还没有认真进行检查。有些厂矿，虽曾进行了检查，但检查的范围还仅仅只限于个人的铺张浪费。生产上管理上的浪费的性质虽和贪污不同，但它给国家人民造成的损失也是很严重的。只拿一个小小的例子来说，据初步统计，张家口九个中小工厂三年来的浪费就有一千零二十二亿元（包括积压资金在内）。对于这些浪费现象难道可以忽视吗？
    反贪污斗争进行得基本彻底的单位，如果反浪费、反官僚主义的检查不彻底，都要在短期内进行补课。领导干部和各部门、车间、小组的职工，都要参加检查生产上管理上有那些浪费，浪费的原因和责任。除了以具体事例教育干部和群众之外，领导上还应根据“三反”中发现的问题，经群众民主讨论，建立和健全计划统计制、专责制、检查制、仓库管理和领料退料制，以及人事制度、民主管理制度等，把运动的胜利成果进一步巩固起来。
