    Chinese Children Protest Against American Aggressors' Germ Warfare

    The heinous crime of American aggressors waging germ warfare has aroused immense anger among children throughout China. Children have written to this newspaper one after another, declaring their determination to oppose the American aggressors.

    All the children of the Beijing Children's Reformatory wrote: "We innocent children have personally suffered from the oppression and persecution of American imperialists. Chairman Mao rescued us from the abyss of fire. Today, American imperialism is attempting to destroy our free and happy lives. Our deep hatred for American imperialism is unforgettable. Today, with doubled anger, we protest against the heinous crime of American imperialism in waging germ warfare." The students of Huang'ao Elementary School in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, wrote: "We are children from the Jinggang Mountains. Most of us are the children of revolutionary martyrs and military families. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory!' We will use practical actions to protest against the crime of American aggressors in waging germ warfare." All the students of Anfeng Elementary School in Dongtai County, Northern Jiangsu Province, entrusted this newspaper to convey to children across the country the following message: "We are happily studying and living, but American imperialists are frantically waging germ warfare, attempting to destroy our happiness. How can we tolerate this! We ask children across the country to take action and dedicate our strength to the fight against germ warfare. At the same time, we jointly ask our fathers and mothers to work hard to increase production and practice thrift, and support the volunteer army uncles, to completely crush all the conspiracies of the American bandits." All the members of the Beijing Fourth Middle School Team of Young Pioneers wrote: "American imperialists are attempting to use bacteriological weapons to kill Korean children and the most beloved volunteer army uncles, which is truly hateful. We will write letters to the volunteer army uncles to comfort them and ask them to severely beat the American bandits." All the members of the Nankou Complete Elementary School of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Team of Young Pioneers wrote: "We are determined to use practical actions such as comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and participating in the epidemic prevention movement, to protest against the atrocities of American aggressors in spreading germs." All the members of the Third Squadron of the Meihekou Railway Elementary School Team of Young Pioneers wrote: "Although we cannot directly fight the American aggressors with guns, we are determined to use practical actions to do a good job in preferential treatment work, support the volunteer army uncles, to crush the conspiracy of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons." All the members of the Songjiaying Central Elementary School Team of Young Pioneers in Fengnan County, Hebei Province, wrote: "We will use practical actions to publicize the crimes of American imperialism in waging germ warfare to our fathers, mothers, and neighbors, support the volunteer army uncles, and fight to crush all the conspiracies of the American bandits."
