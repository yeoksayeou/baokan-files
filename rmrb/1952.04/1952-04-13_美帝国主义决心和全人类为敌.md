    American Imperialism is Determined to be the Enemy of All Humanity
    Zhou Jianren
    We investigated the facts in the Northeast about how American imperialist planes dropped insects and other objects carrying germs and viruses onto our land, and we obtained "germ bombs" and other containers for carrying insects. We also ascertained that the insects and other objects did indeed carry bacteria and viruses, and confirmed that viruses from the insects had already caused acute encephalitis in humans. These pieces of evidence of American imperialism's crimes prove that American imperialism is the enemy of all humanity.
    I believe that anyone who hears about American imperialism's germ warfare will inevitably feel an unspeakable hatred, disdain, and contempt for the American aggressors. When we met members of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team in the Northeast, they immediately showed hatred on their faces when they saw the evidence of American aggressors spreading germs on Chinese soil, and affirmed that American imperialism had committed a heinous crime against humanity. Because good scientists are working hard to eradicate bacteria and viruses, but the American aggressors are creating new diseases for mankind. If the Chinese people do not immediately eradicate these bacteria, they may spread to other countries and poison the people of any country. Even the American people are no exception. Therefore, the people of any country should hate the inhuman and evil actions of the American aggressors. This monstrous crime of American imperialism shows that it has moved far away from humanity and is determined to be the enemy of all mankind.

    美帝国主义决心和全人类为敌
    周建人
    我们在东北查明了美帝国主义的飞机怎样把带有病菌和病毒的昆虫等物投到我国土地上的事实，并且获得了“细菌弹”和装带昆虫的其他容器。我们又查明了昆虫等物确实带有细菌和病毒，并且证实了从昆虫体上来的病毒已经使人患了急性脑炎。美帝国主义的这些罪证，证明了美帝国主义是与全人类为敌的。
    我相信：无论何人听到美帝国主义进行细菌战，都不可避免地要对美国侵略者产生一种无可言喻的仇视、鄙视、蔑视的心情。我们在东北遇见国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的团员们，他们看到美国侵略者在中国土地上撒布细菌的罪证时，脸上立刻显出憎恨的样子，而且肯定美帝国主义犯了与人类为敌的大罪。因为善良的科学家们正在努力扑灭细菌病毒，而美国侵略者却给人类制造新的疾病。如果中国人民不立刻扑灭这些细菌，它有传染到别的国家的可能，有毒害任何一国人民的可能。即使美国人民也不能例外。所以任何国家的人民都要痛恨美国侵略者这种违反人道的罪恶行动。美帝国主义这个滔天罪行，表明它已远远地离开人类，决心和全世界人类为敌。
