Shenyang Municipal Private Xindong Iron Factory Workers

Hold Labor-Capital Consultation Meeting, Unite with Capitalists to Actively Manage Business

Consolidate the Victory of the "Five-Anti" Struggle, and Improve Production

The workers of the Shenyang private Xindong Iron Factory, which has already concluded its case, proactively held a labor-capital consultation meeting recently to consolidate the victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle, unite with the capitalists to actively manage the business, and improve the production situation day by day.

Under the exposure and supervision of the factory's employees, the capitalist of Xindong Iron Factory relatively thoroughly confessed the illegal facts of cutting corners and using inferior materials and falsely reporting costs when processing for the state during the "Five-Anti" movement. At the employee review meeting, the capitalist comparatively honestly bowed their head to admit their guilt and expressed remorse, thereby receiving lenient treatment from the People's Government. After the case was closed, the factory workers, under the leadership of the trade union, promptly convened a labor-capital consultation meeting. In order to ensure that the capitalist would no longer engage in illegal business practices, both parties signed an agreement to make the accounts public, as well as to make public the cost of processing orders and the processing order contracts. The workers also actively proposed that the manager and the factory director should have specific divisions of labor to avoid the past phenomenon of everyone grabbing at things randomly or everyone ignoring things altogether; that in the purchase of tools, they should not only focus on saving money, which would affect production; and that machine depreciation fees and tool loss fees should be accumulated to purchase machines and tools. There were more than twenty such reasonable suggestions, which had a significant impact on improving production management. The workers also requested the capitalist to repair the kitchen roof, exchange the small dining hall and the small warehouse, and set up clothes boxes to appropriately improve the welfare facilities for the employees. This selfless spirit of the workers deeply moved the capitalist, and factory director Xu Rijun immediately stated that they would accept the leadership of the working class in the future, work hard to manage the business, and become a truly law-abiding industrialist and businessman. They also decided to add an 18-foot boiler, install a 15-horsepower motor to test the specifications of the steam pumps and air compressors they produce; manufacture a drilling bed, take turns repairing the existing twelve old machines, and add four workers to expand production. In addition, the capitalist also expressed their intention to disclose their technical secrets, which they had kept for more than 20 years, and teach several workers how to calculate costs. All employees also firmly guaranteed to abide by labor discipline and improve production. At this meeting, even fitter Song Junfu, who usually did not like to talk, said that he would repair a broken lathe in his spare time. He said, "As long as the boss manages the business earnestly, our output and quality will surely improve step by step." The meeting also decided that the employees would organize a review team and an inspection team, under the leadership of the trade union. The former would be responsible for reviewing processing contracts, order costs, and incoming and outgoing accounts, while the latter would specifically inspect the raw materials entering the factory and the finished products leaving the factory to prevent the capitalist from cutting corners and ensure product quality. Guo Songmao, the trade union group leader, said, "In the past, processing contracts were not made public, and the workers had no way of knowing whether the capitalist was cutting corners. In the future, we must carefully review processing contracts and costs and never allow the capitalist to repeat their old mistakes."

Currently, the production outlook of the Xindong Iron Factory has gradually changed: the two managers and one factory director have clarified their responsibilities, and their enthusiasm for management has also increased; the workers' enthusiasm for production is even higher. At the end of March, the factory and a certain state-owned factory formulated a contract to process parts for two marble cutting machines within a month. After calculating the raw materials and man-hours, it was handed over to the review team for review. This would save the country at least 300 jin of iron materials and one-eighth of the processing fee compared to before the "Five-Anti", while the capitalist's legitimate profit was not reduced. Through the continuous efforts of the workers, the entire task can be completed one week ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    沈阳市私营新东铁工厂职工
    召开劳资协商会议团结资方积极经营
    巩固“五反”斗争的胜利成果，使生产情况日益改善
    沈阳市已经作出结论的私营新东铁工厂职工，为巩固“五反”斗争的胜利成果，在日前主动召开劳资协商会议，团结资方积极经营，使生产情况日益改善。
    新东铁工厂资方在全厂职工的检举和督促下，在“五反”运动中比较彻底地坦白了给国家加工时偷工减料、虚报成本的违法事实，并在职工审查会上，比较老实地低头认罪和悔过，因此得到了人民政府的宽大处理。结案后，该厂职工在工会领导下及时召开了劳资协商会议。为了保证资方不再从事非法经营，双方订立了公开账目，公开加工定货成本和加工定货合同的协议。职工们并积极提出：经理、厂长应有具体分工，避免过去有时各人乱抓，有时大家不管的现象；在购买工具上，不要光图省钱，以致影响生产；应该积累机器折旧费和工具损失费，以购买机器工具。类似这样的合理意见一共有二十多条，对改进生产管理有很大的作用。工人们同时也要求资方修理厨房屋顶，把狭小的饭堂和小仓库对调，设置衣服箱等以适当改善职工的福利设施。职工们的这种大公无私的精神，使资方很受感动，厂长徐日俊当即表示：以后决定接受工人阶级的领导，努力经营，做一个真正守法的工商业者。并决定添制一台十八呎锅炉，安设一个十五匹马力的电动机，以试验所制蒸汽泵和空气压缩机等成品的规格；制造一台钻眼床，轮番修理现有的十二台旧机器，增加四名工人，以扩大生产。此外，资方还表示要公开他保守了二十多年的技术秘密，教几个工人学会成本计算。全体职工也坚决保证遵守劳动纪律，搞好生产。在这次会上，连素常不爱说话的钳工宋君福，也表示要在业余时间修好一台坏车床，他说：“只要掌柜的认真经营，咱们的产量、质量保管步步提高。”会议并决定由职工组织审查组和检查组，在工会领导下，前者负责审查加工合同、定货成本和进出账项；后者专门检查进厂的原料和出厂的成品，以防止资方偷工减料和保证产品质量。工会小组长郭松茂说：“过去加工合同不公开，资方有没有偷工减料的行为职工无从知道，今后我们一定要认真审查加工合同和成本，决不让资方再犯老毛病。”
    目前，新东铁工厂的生产面貌已逐渐改观：两个经理和一个厂长已分清了职责，经营的积极性也提高了；工人们的生产热情更高。三月底，该厂和某公营工厂制订了在一个月内加工两台大理石切断机部分的合同。在算出原材料和工时后，即交给审查组审查，比在“五反”前至少可使国家节省三百斤铁料和八分之一的加工费，而资本家的合法利润则并未减低。经工人们不断努力，全部任务并可提前一星期完成。    （新华社）
