Letter Summary:

    Jinzhou Railway Cultural Troupe Should Help Workers' Amateur Performances
    The Northeast Jinzhou Railway Cultural Troupe, with thirty to forty members, did not stage any programs to educate workers during the anti-corruption, anti-theft movement; nor did the troupe stage any programs to expose the conspiracy of American imperialism's germ warfare. In late March, workers from the Jinzhou Railway Locomotive Depot used their spare time to create several short programs that combined current political tasks and performed them at the club. Not only did the comrades of the cultural troupe not enthusiastically help, but they also caused disputes over issues such as borrowing scenery and watching the show, which delayed the opening time on the 25th by one and a half hours, causing dissatisfaction among the audience. We believe that professional art troupes have an obligation to help workers' amateur performances. The attitude of the Jinzhou Railway Cultural Troupe is incorrect.

    锦州铁路文工团应帮助职工的业余演出
    拥有三、四十名团员的东北锦州铁路文工团，在反贪污、反盗窃运动中，没有演出任何节目向职工进行教育；对美帝国主义进行细菌战的阴谋，该团也未演出任何节目进行揭露。三月下旬，锦州铁路机务段的职工利用业余时间，创作了几个结合目前政治任务的短小节目，在俱乐部演出。文工团同志不但不热情予以帮助，反而因借布景、看戏等问题，造成纠纷，使二十五日的开幕时间推迟一小时半，引起观众不满。我们认为，专业文艺团体有帮助职工业余演出的义务。像锦州铁路文工团的这种态度是不正确的。
