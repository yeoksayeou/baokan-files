The chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, He Hengfu, is an arch-embezzler and profiteer guilty of every imaginable crime. For more than two years, he has used his positions as a member of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, a member of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, a member of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, a representative to the Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference, and the chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee as cover to organize and lead a large-scale embezzlement group, stealing state property, a portion of which already amounts to hundreds of billions of yuan. He has also transferred some of it abroad.

He Hengfu is a "tycoon" in Wuhan's business community, the owner of Qianchang Trading Company, chairman of Huanian Industrial Company, general manager of Qinghua Pigment Company, and a director of Hankou Commercial Bank, Yuhua Textile Factory, Dahua Textile Factory, and Daxing Textile Factory. He is also a giant in Wuhan's private foreign trade sector. Before liberation, most of these firms and factories were on the verge of collapse or in dire straits, and He Hengfu himself had fled to Hong Kong. After the liberation of Wuhan, the People's Government vigorously supported these enterprises, enabling them to develop rapidly. After He Hengfu returned to Hankou from Hong Kong, he feigned progressiveness, thus gaining political positions such as a member of the People's Government and a People's Representative. At that time, the People's Government hoped that he would lead Wuhan's business community to improve management and develop industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, the arch-profiteer He Hengfu did not intend to do so. Instead, he used various tricks to organize and lead an embezzlement group to conceal large quantities of enemy property and steal large amounts of state property. This embezzlement group was originally called the "Dinner Party," including seven oil firms: Yongsheng, Qichang, Jinchang, Chunyuan, Yuanchang, Tongyi, and Qianchang. In October 1950, it expanded into the "International Trade Rotating Dinner Party," and in 1951, it publicly appeared as the International Trade Joint Operation Group. After the establishment of the International Trade Commercial Association, this embezzlement group carried out large-scale theft activities in the name of the association's Oil and Fats Group.

This embezzlement group was large in scale and had a strict division of labor. He himself was responsible for the so-called "upper-level" connections and did not publicly appear in the group. The targets of attack for this embezzlement group included: China Oils and Fats Company, the Municipal Tax Bureau, the Bank of China, the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration, the Hubei Provincial Trading Company, and the Customs, Railway, and Shipping Bureaus, etc. They used the method of "pulling in" and "sending in" spies in these state economic organs. For example, Xu Zhongyi, deputy director of the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration, Ni Tongjia, head of the administrative section, Yan Ge, head of the import and export section, Chen Anxing, deputy manager of the Wuhan branch of the Bank of China, Ke Yuncheng, head of the loan section, and other responsible staff members were all economic spies placed by this embezzlement group. These profiteers controlled the key departments of these organs related to foreign trade, export exchange settlement, material adjustment, tax ticket handling, and promotion of imported goods, turning these organs into institutions for profiteers to carry out embezzlement and monopoly.

The arch-profiteer He Hengfu, wearing the cloak of a People's Representative during the day, attended meetings of the People's Government, and at night, he summoned profiteers to leak state economic intelligence and discuss plans for embezzling state property. Here are just two examples: In April 1950, he took advantage of his attendance at the meeting of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee to bring back four confidential documents issued at the meeting for return within a limited time: "An Outline of the Five Major Production Enterprises of Textiles, Cigarettes, Coal, Matches, and Oil Extraction in the Central South Region and the Production and Sales Plan for the Second Half of 1950," "The Grain Production and Sales Situation and Adjustment Measures in the Central South Region," etc., and handed them over to Xie Yifan, then secretary-general of the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee (a secret agent, already executed), for copying all night. In early February 1951, he again attended the meeting of the Central South Financial and Economic Committee. After the meeting, he sent the information about the national demand for timber and the implementation of unified timber allocation to timber merchants Quan Yidao, Chen Li, and others. These profiteers then rushed to purchase timber in Wuhan and Hunan producing areas, creating a price surge in the timber market, which, according to rough estimates, caused the state a loss of about 4 billion yuan.

In addition to directly stealing economic intelligence from the economic meetings of the People's Government, the arch-profiteer He Hengfu also stole various economic intelligence through the spies he had placed in various organs to arrange and manipulate the market. Here are just a few examples: In December 1949, the profiteer Sun Guangyu, who was sent by He Hengfu into the Central South Region Company of the China Oils and Fats Company, stole the information that our country was going to conduct tung oil trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. The profiteer group headed by He Hengfu collectively raised prices in the market. At that time, the price of tung oil was more than 230,000 yuan per dan, but in a few days, the profiteers raised it to 290,000 yuan. In June 1950, the profiteer Yang Xiaoyan, who had burrowed into the Hubei Provincial Trading Company, stole the information that the state-owned company was going to sell tung oil. The profiteer group headed by He Hengfu collectively lowered prices in the market. On June 10 of the same day, the tung oil price fell from 620,000 yuan to 550,000 yuan. In November of the same year, Ni Tongjia, a profiteer sent by this profiteer group to the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration, stole the information that the People's Government decided to levy an additional 10% export tax on tung oil exported from Shanghai and Hankou starting from December 15. The profiteers rushed to transport tung oil for export overnight. He Hengfu's Qianchang Trading Company and Huanian Industrial Company rushed to transport 4,788 dan of tung oil for export. The loss of state tax revenue this time, according to extremely incomplete statistics, amounted to 6 billion yuan.

The arch-profiteer He Hengfu and his partners, through the theft network, stole countless state property and squeezed countless people's sweat. The amount that has been found so far is shocking. From February to December 1951 alone, they stole hundreds of thousands of dan of materials stored by the China Oils and Fats Company Central South Region Company and the Hubei Provincial Trading Company in these profiteers' trading firms by using the trick of stealing the sky and changing the day, including: 147,670 dan of Wu Bei Zi, 28,866 dan of black fungus, 76,230 dan of white sesame, 36,500 dan of raw lacquer, 4,000 dan of black moss, etc., with a total value of about 420 billion yuan. The export visas, exchange settlements, and tax assessments necessary for them to steal and transport such a large batch of goods for export were completely handled by the spies they placed in government financial and economic organs by secretly stamping official seals. At that time, the arch-profiteer He Hengfu was obsessed with his "supernatural powers" and arrogantly said to others: "Apart from me, no one else can do it, nor dares to do it."

The arch-profiteer He Hengfu and his partners also frantically trafficked large quantities of morphine, heroin, and other drugs, and smuggled huge amounts of gold for export.

The tax evasion and evasion behavior of this group of profiteers is also very serious. Qianchang Trading Company, owned by He Hengfu alone, evaded more than 6.83 billion yuan in taxes. On the one hand, the firm withdrew funds to evade taxation, and on the other hand, it defrauded the People's Bank of loans. In 1951 alone, loans amounted to 24 billion yuan. The loans were of different lengths, but on average, 1 billion yuan of loans were defrauded by He Hengfu every day. After He Hengfu obtained the state's large loans, he used them to engage in speculation, manipulation of the market, and other destructive activities.

Not only that, the greed of this group of profiteers became increasingly fierce, and their courage became increasingly great. Their destructive activities against the national economy gradually developed from covert to overt. They even openly put forward their own policies to replace the policies of the People's Government. In December 1950, the nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was vigorously launched. In order to counter the "economic blockade" of U.S. imperialism, the People's Government prohibited the export of tung oil. He Hengfu repeatedly went to the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, criticizing the policy of the People's Government as "dead-end, dead measures." He also organized the "tycoons" of the trading firms and coerced the People's Government, saying: "If tung oil is not allowed to be exported, we will not be able to clear our debts and will inevitably collapse." In 1951, in order to control market transactions, stabilize prices, and strengthen market management, the state-owned Oils and Fats Company strengthened market management. The He Hengfu embezzlement group believed that this would disrupt their speculative activities of buying and selling short, so they went on a disguised market strike for seven days under the instruction of He Hengfu, openly opposing the leadership of the state-owned economy. After the "Five-Anti" movement began, He Hengfu not only did not repent and bow his head to the people to admit his guilt, but instead used his position as a "government member" and "People's Representative" to sabotage the movement. On the evening of January 25 this year, He Hengfu summoned the key members of the embezzlement group to a meeting at his home. He said: "The Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements are short-term. We cannot talk about what we have done in the past to the outside world. If anyone talks about it, I am a member of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee and the chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, hehe, I'm afraid everyone will look bad." After the Five-Anti movement deepened, the embezzlers were panicked. He Hengfu said to his grandson He Xijing: "Put the confidential letters and telegrams from Hong Kong in my room. I am a member of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee and I am not afraid of others coming to investigate." Soon after, he burned all these confidential letters and telegrams. But no matter how the arch-profiteer He Hengfu and others conspired to resist, this large embezzlement group was finally uncovered by the People's Government. The People's Government has arrested Ye Jiao'an, the manager of Jinchang Oil Firm, and the arch-profiteer Zhang Lisheng, who were important members of the embezzlement group. Li Jingwen, the general manager of the arch-profiteer Yirui Trading Company, had to confess the crimes of the embezzlement group in the face of evidence and the pressure of the masses. This embezzlement group has been disintegrated, but He Hengfu is still trying to resist to the end, refusing to confess and repent, thus arousing the indignation of Wuhan's business community, democratic parties, workers, and the broad masses of the people, who have demanded that the People's Government arrest and bring the arch-profiteer He Hengfu to justice. Some have even accused the People's Government of being too lenient with the arch-profiteer He Hengfu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    五毒俱全的大奸商贺衡夫
    武汉市工商联筹委会主任委员贺衡夫是一个五毒俱全的大盗窃分子。两年多来，他以中南军政委员会委员、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会委员、武汉市人民政府委员、市各界人民代表会议代表、市工商联筹委会主任委员的身份为掩护，组织并领导大规模的盗窃集团，盗窃国家财产据部分已统计出来的数目即达数千亿元，并将其中一部分转移到国外去。
    贺衡夫是武汉市工商界中的一个“大亨”，乾昌贸易行老板，华年实业公司董事长，庆华颜料公司总经理，汉口商业银行、裕华纱厂、大华纱厂、大兴纱厂等企业的董事，同时是武汉市私营对外贸易行业的巨头。解放前，这些行、厂绝大部分奄奄待毙或焦头烂额，贺衡夫本人也出走香港。武汉解放后，人民政府对这些企业大力予以扶植，使它们迅速获得发展。贺衡夫从香港回到汉口后，伪装进步，因而取得了人民政府委员、人民代表等政治地位。当时人民政府希望他领导武汉工商界改善经营，发展有利于国计民生的工商业，但大奸商贺衡夫意不在此，却大耍手段，组织并领导盗窃集团，隐匿大宗敌产，盗窃大量国家财产。这个盗窃集团的名称原来叫做“聚餐会”，包括永生、其昌、晋昌、春源、源昌、同义、乾昌等七家油行。一九五零年十月扩大为“国际贸易轮餐会”，一九五一年公开以国际贸易联营组的面目出现。国际贸易商业会成立后，这个盗窃集团又以该会油脂小组的名义，大规模地进行盗窃活动。
    这个盗窃集团组织庞大，分工严密。贺本人负责所谓“上层”联系，不公开在小组出面。这个盗窃集团进攻的目标有：中国油脂公司、市税务局、中国银行、武汉对外贸易管理局、湖北省贸易公司和海关、铁路、航运局等等。他们用“拉过去”、“派进来”的办法在这些国家经济机关中布置了坐探，例如武汉对外贸易管理局副局长许钟毅、行政科长倪同甲、进出口科长严格、中国银行武汉市分行副经理陈安性、放款科长柯云程等等相当负责的工作人员，都是这个盗窃集团所安置的经济奸细。奸商们掌握了这些机关的有关对外贸易，出口结汇，调剂物资，办理税票和推销入口货物等工作的要害部门，使这些机关变质成为奸商们进行盗窃垄断的机构。
    大奸商贺衡夫白天披着人民代表的外衣，参加人民政府的会议，晚上就召集奸商泄露国家经济情报，商量盗窃国家财产的计划。这里只举两个例子：一九五零年四月，他利用出席中南军政委员会财政经济委员会会议的机会，把会上所发的限期交回的四项机密文件：“中南区纺织、卷烟、煤炭、火柴、榨油五大生产事业概要及一九五零年下半年产销计划”、“中南区粮食产销情况及调剂办法”等带回来，交给当时的工商联筹委会秘书长谢一凡（特务分子，已枪决）通夜抄写。一九五一年二月初，他又参加中南财政经济委员会会议，会后他把全国需要木材的情况和实行木材统一调配的情报，送给竹木业奸商全裕道、陈醴等。这些奸商就在武汉和湖南产区抢购木材，造成木材市场上的涨风，据粗略估计，约使国家损失四十亿元。
    大奸商贺衡夫除了直接从人民政府的经济会议上盗取经济情报外，还通过他在各机关中所安设的坐探窃取各种经济情报，布置操纵市场。这里也只举出几个例子：一九四九年十二月，由贺衡夫派入中国油脂公司中南区公司的奸商孙光裕偷窃了我国要和苏联及新民主主义国家进行桐油贸易的情报，以贺衡夫为首的奸商集团就在市场上集体抬价，当时每担桐油的价格是二十三万多元，但不几天就被奸商哄抬到二十九万元。一九五零年六月，钻入湖北省贸易公司的奸商杨孝炎偷窃了国营公司要抛售桐油的情报后，以贺衡夫为首的奸商集团又在市场上集体压价，六月十日一天内，桐油行市就从六十二万元落到五十五万元。同年十一月，这个奸商集团派在武汉对外贸易管理局的奸商倪同甲，窃得了人民政府决定从十二月十五日起对上海、汉口两地出口桐油另征百分之十的出口税的情报，奸商们就漏夜抢运桐油出口，贺衡夫的乾昌贸易行和华年实业公司就抢运了四千七百八十八担桐油出口。这次使国家税收所受的损失，据极不完整的统计就达六十亿元。
    大奸商贺衡夫和他的伙伴们通过盗窃网，不知盗窃了多少国家财产，榨取了多少人民血汗，据目前已查明的就十分惊人了。仅一九五一年二月至十二月间，他们用偷天换日的手段就盗卖了中国油脂公司中南区公司、湖北省贸易公司存在这些奸商的贸易行里的几十万担物资，计：五棓子十四万七千六百七十多担，黑木耳二万八千八百六十六担，白芝麻七万六千二百三十多担，生漆三万六千五百多担，发菜四千多担等等，总值约四千二百亿元。他们盗运这样大批物资出口所必需的出口签证、结汇、定税等手续完全由其安置在政府财经机关中的奸细偷盖公章予以办理。当时大奸商贺衡夫醉心于他的 “神通广大”，曾狂妄地对人说：“除了我，别人不能为，也不敢为。”
    大奸商贺衡夫和他的伙伴们，还丧心病狂地贩卖大宗吗啡、海洛英等毒品，盗运巨额黄金出口。
    这批大奸商的偷税漏税行为也是很严重的。单是贺衡夫的乾昌贸易行，偷漏税款就达六十八亿三千多万元。该行一方面抽走资金，逃避纳税，另一方面又向人民银行骗取贷款，一九五一年全年贷款达二百四十亿元，这些贷款的日期长短不同，平均每天有十亿元贷款被骗在贺衡夫手中。贺衡夫将国家的大笔贷款拿到手后，即用来从事投机倒把、操纵市场等破坏活动。
    不仅如此，这批大奸商的贼心愈来愈狠，胆量愈来愈大，他们对国家经济的破坏活动从隐蔽的逐步发展到公开的，他们甚至公然提出自己的政策来代替人民政府的政策。一九五零年十二月，全国人民的抗美援朝运动蓬勃展开，人民政府为了反击美帝国主义的“经济封锁”，禁止桐油出口，贺衡夫竟几次到中南军政委员会贸易部，批评人民政府的政策是“死办法，办法死”。他并把贸易商行的“大亨”们组织起来，要挟人民政府说：“不放桐油出口，我们就无法清理债务，势必垮台。”一九五一年，国营油脂公司为了掌握市场交易，稳定物价，加强了市场管理，贺衡夫盗窃集团认为这样就破坏了他们买空卖空的投机活动，竟在贺衡夫的指使下变相罢市七天，公开反对国营经济的领导。 “五反”运动开始以后，贺衡夫不但不幡然悔悟，向人民低头认罪，反而利用“政府委员”、“人民代表”的地位来破坏运动。今年一月二十五日晚，贺衡夫在家中召集盗窃集团的重要分子开会，他说：“三反，五反是短期的，我们过去所做的事，不能对外面讲，谁要讲了，我是中南军政委员会委员，又是工商联主委，嘿嘿，怕大家都不好看。”五反运动深入后，盗窃分子惊惶失措，贺衡夫对他的孙子贺锡敬说：“你把香港来的机密函电放在我房里，我是中南军政委员会委员，不怕别人来查。”不久他又把这批机密函电全部烧毁了。但是不管大奸商贺衡夫等如何阴谋抵抗，这个大盗窃集团终归被人民政府破获了。人民政府已将该盗窃集团中的重要分子、晋昌油行经理叶教庵和大奸商张利生逮捕，大奸商义瑞贸易行总经理李景文在罪证面前和群众的压力下也不得不坦白承认该盗窃集团的罪行。这个盗窃集团已被瓦解了，但是贺衡夫还企图顽抗到底，拒不坦白悔过，因而激起了武汉市工商界、民主党派、职工群众和广大人民的义愤，纷纷要求人民政府将大奸商贺衡夫逮捕法办，甚至有人责备人民政府对大奸商贺衡夫太姑息了。（新华社）
