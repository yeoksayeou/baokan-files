Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia," published in 1899, is an outstanding scientific work of Marxist political economy. This work played a huge role in the Russian Revolution: it pointed out the specific characteristics of the socio-economic development of Russia to the Russian Bolshevik Party, enabling the Party's guidance of the revolution to be based on a scientific theoretical foundation. At the same time, it provided new arguments and developments for the theory of "Capital," marking a new development of Marxist political economy in the Leninist stage.

The purpose of this work by Lenin was to thoroughly crush the Populist ideology in thought. This was because the Populist thought at that time hindered the central task put forward in the most important stage of the Russian workers' movement—combining the socialist movement with the workers' movement to create an independent political party of the working class.

The Populists examined the economic phenomena of Russia at that time with an idealistic eye, completely mistakenly viewing the developing capitalism as declining and degenerating, and believing that capitalism in Russia was entirely an accidental phenomenon. Therefore, they妄想(wangxiang: presumptuously hoped) to enter socialism without the proletariat; pinning their hopes on the "rural commune" and the peasants, which they described as the embryo and foundation of socialism. In this way, they "prevented the working class from understanding its leading role in the revolution and hindered the cause of creating an independent political party of the working class," ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)"). "Therefore, the Russian Marxist movement at that time could only grow and strengthen by fighting against Populism."

However, to completely crush the Populist ideology, it was necessary to take the historical materialism and political economy created by Marx and Engels as a guide, "to examine and describe the entire process of capitalist development in Russia in its entirety" (preface). Only in this way can we arm ourselves and crush the enemy ideologically. In this situation, political economy was elevated to a primary position. Lenin shouldered this arduous historical task, overcame various difficulties during his imprisonment and exile, and successfully completed it.

The Populists believed that capitalism could not develop in Russia. Their reason was that the increasing poverty and bankruptcy of Russian peasants reduced the domestic market, and the foreign market was not something that Russia, which was lagging behind in capitalist development, could obtain. Therefore, the focus of the struggle with the Populists in economic theory was the issue of the formation of the domestic market, that is, the issue of whether capitalism was developing in Russia.

Lenin started from Marx's theory of reproduction and developed the essence and significance of Marx's theory. He pointed out that the issue of the capitalist market cannot be separated from the issue of capitalist development. The development of capitalism itself creates a domestic market. The development of commodity economy based on the division of labor in society will inevitably deepen the social division of labor and divide small producers into capitalists and workers. When the means of production of small producers are deprived and concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie to become capital, both the means of production and the means of subsistence become commodities, and the producers are also engaged in commodity production. The domestic market is expanding with the progress of this differentiation process.

Lenin analyzed the Russian rural economy from all aspects with a huge amount of statistics, irrefutably pointing out that the countryside was already in the environment of a commodity economy, and that a huge differentiation had developed among the peasants, dividing them into rich peasants and poor peasants. The rich peasants, who accounted for only 20 percent, owned more than half of the land and draught animals, used new-style improved tools, and hired a large number of long-term and day laborers. All this showed that the "commune" was nothing more than "an ordinary petty-bourgeois system." Therefore, "the commune is by no means an antagonistic force to capitalism, but on the contrary, it is its deepest and most solid foundation" (page 146). In this way, Lenin thoroughly crushed the reactionary arguments of the Populists who praised the "rural commune" and small-scale peasant production, and exposed the rich peasant stance of the Populists.

While analyzing that capitalism was already developing rapidly, Lenin particularly emphasized the regularity and progressiveness of the transition from feudal economy to capitalist economy. This progress is mainly due to the increase and socialization of social labor productivity. At the same time, Lenin pointed out that recognizing this progressiveness is completely consistent with recognizing the dark aspects of capitalism and recognizing the transitional nature of capitalism and its internal profound contradictions. The Populists' reactionary fantasy of attempting to hinder the development of capitalism, which completely violated the requirements of socio-economic development, was also defeated by Lenin.

When Lenin explained the transition from feudal economy to capitalist economy, he analyzed the landlord economic system, which had great significance both theoretically and practically. Lenin's discussion of the essence of the feudal economy, the developing trend of the Russian landlord economy, and the obstruction of feudal remnants to capitalist development pointed out the economic foundation of the Russian democratic revolution, the economic foundation for the alliance between workers and peasants against the landlord and Tsarist autocratic system, and at the same time made us realize that the central issue of the Russian historical process was to overthrow the land ownership of the landlord class and solve the peasants' land problem. And the struggle between the two paths for solving the land problem—that is, the revolutionary path of thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants under the leadership of the proletariat and the bourgeois reformist path—was the key to determining whether the Russian democratic revolution could be victorious. The tactics of the Russian Bolsheviks in the revolution from 1905 to 1907 were correctly stipulated based on this analysis.

Lenin's examination of the history of Russian industrial capitalism powerfully shattered the Populists' false claims about so-called "national production" and about the reduction or slow development of the Russian working class.

The fact of industrial development is that small-scale commodity production handicrafts, just as seen in the "rural commune," are not a "national production" system, but the initial sprouts of capitalism. This kind of small-scale commodity production is the petty bourgeoisie on the one hand and wage laborers on the other. In the workshops, the workers are carrying out capitalist cooperation under the command of the small bosses. It is completely wrong for the Populists to artificially cut off the connection between small-scale commodity production and other forms of industry, and to only regard capitalist industry as factory industry.

In the chapter on the development of large-scale machine industry, after defining the scientific concept of "factory," Lenin used statistics from various industrial sectors to point out the industrial growth, especially the industrial concentration. Lenin pointed out that the number of workers in large enterprises more than doubled from 1865 to 1890. "Not only is it increasing much faster than the entire population, but it is even faster than the urban population." The Populists' nonsense that the number of factories in Russia was decreasing, using incorrect statistical methods, went completely bankrupt.

The final part of this book is an overview of the formation of the Russian domestic market, and it is also a complete summary of the development of capitalism in Russia. At the same time, it is the final announcement of the complete annihilation of Populist thought. From the perspective of the unity of commodity production and commodity circulation, Lenin revealed the situation of transportation, commerce, industrial population, the number of wage laborers, and the large-scale development of cities. This clearly shows that Russia is advancing along the path of capitalism, both in agriculture and industry, and that capitalism and the domestic market are constantly increasing. But at the same time, Lenin emphasized the obstructive effect of feudal remnants on capitalist production. Russia is still a backward country dominated by agriculture.

All the arguments developed by Lenin in this book are based on the principles of "Capital." The most prominent feature of this book is that it observes the entire facts of Russia's economic development as a whole, studies its various aspects and extremely complex internal connections, and gives a complete description of the development of capitalism in Russia. In this way, Lenin showed himself to be a creative Marxist, truly upholding Marxism and developing Marxism.

Lenin developed Marx's political and economic thought in this book, which is reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, Lenin, based on the development of capitalism in Russia, argued, developed, and concretized the viewpoints that Marx had already determined in "Capital"; on the other hand, precisely because of the specific analysis of the Russian economy, Marx's viewpoints were developed in a universal sense. These two aspects are unified and embody the interrelationship between theory and practice, general and particular.

The problem discussed by Marx in "Capital" "is the capitalist method of production and its corresponding relations of production and exchange" (preface to the first edition of Capital), mainly dissecting the production and realization of surplus value and its distribution among the exploiting classes. When analyzing capitalist relations of production, he discarded the various factors of pre-capitalism and took England, where capitalism had already highly developed, as the main example. Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia," on the other hand, starts from the actual situation in Russia and mainly studies the emergence and development of capitalist relations of production. It is in this aspect that Lenin added new wealth to the treasure house of Marxism.

    列宁的伟大著作“俄国资本主义底发展”
    龚士其
    列宁于一八九九年出版的“俄国资本主义底发展”，是马克思主义政治经济学的杰出的科学著作。这一著作，在俄国革命中起过巨大的作用：它给俄国布尔什维克党指出俄国社会经济发展的具体特点，使党对于革命的指导，建立在科学的理论基础之上。同时，它又给“资本论”的理论以新的论证和发挥，标志着马克思主义政治经济学在列宁主义阶段的新发展。
    列宁的这一著作，其目的是为了在思想上彻底粉碎民粹主义。这是因为当时的民粹主义思想，对于俄国工人运动最重要阶段所提出的中心任务——把社会主义运动和工人运动结合起来，创立工人阶级独立政党——起着妨碍作用。
    民粹派以唯心主义眼光考察当时的俄国的经济现象，完全错误地把正在发展着的资本主义看成正在衰落、退化，并认为资本主义在俄国完全是一种偶然的现象。因而，他们妄想不要无产阶级就进入社会主义；把自己的希望寄托在被他们描述成社会主义胚胎和基础的“农村公社”和农民身上。这样，他们就“妨碍工人阶级了解自己在革命中的领导作用，阻碍创立工人阶级独立政党的事业”，“因此，当时俄国马克思主义运动只有同民粹主义作斗争，才能成长和强固起来。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”）。
    但是，要彻底粉碎民粹主义思想，就必须以马克思、恩格斯所创立的历史唯物主义和政治经济学为指南，“把俄国资本主义发展的全部过程，整个地加以考察并描述出来”（序言）。如此，才能达到武装自己，从思想上粉碎敌人的目的。在这一情况下，政治经济学被提到首要地位。列宁就肩负起这一艰巨的历史任务，克服了在监狱和流放期中的种种困难，胜利地完成了它。
    民粹派认为资本主义在俄国不能发展起来。其所持的理由是：俄国农民日益贫困和破产，这就缩减着国内市场，而国外市场又不是资本主义发展较迟的俄国所能取得。因而，和民粹派在经济理论上斗争的集中点，就是关于国内市场形成的问题，也就是关于资本主义在俄国是否发展的问题。
    列宁从马克思底再生产理论出发，并发挥了马克思这一理论的实质和意义。他指出：不能把资本主义市场问题和资本主义的发展问题分开来。资本主义发展的本身，就创造着国内市场。立于社会分工基础之上的商品经济底发展，必然又加深社会分工，并把小生产者分化，分成资本家和工人。当小生产者的生产资料被剥夺，并集中在资产阶级手中成为资本时，无论生产资料和生活资料，就都成为商品，生产者也都从事于商品生产。国内市场正是随着这一分化过程的进展而日益扩展开来。
    列宁从各个方面以巨量的统计数字分析了俄国的农村经济，无可辩驳地指出：农村已处于商品经济的环境，农民间已经发展了巨大的分化，分成富农和贫农。仅占百分之二十的富农占有了一半以上的土地和耕畜，使用着新式的改良工具，大量雇用长工和日工。这一切，都表明了“公社”不是别的，正是“普通的小资产阶级制度”。因而，“公社决不是资本主义的对抗力量，但相反的，是它的最深刻最巩固的基础”（一四六页）。这样，列宁就把民粹派歌颂“农村公社”、农民小生产的反动论调彻底粉碎，并且揭露了民粹派的富农立场。
    在分析资本主义已经在迅速发展时，列宁特别强调着从封建经济过渡到资本主义经济的规律性和它的进步性。这一进步，主要的在于社会劳动生产力底提高及社会化。列宁同时又指出：承认这种进步性，和承认资本主义的黑暗方面，承认资本主义的过渡性质和其内部深刻的矛盾，是完全一致的。民粹派完全违背着社会经济发展的要求，企图阻碍资本主义发展的反动的空想，也被列宁击破了。
    列宁说明从封建经济过渡到资本主义经济时，分析了地主经济制度，这种分析，不论在理论上和实践上都有重大的意义。列宁对于封建经济的实质，俄国地主经济正在发展的趋势，以及封建残余对资本主义发展的阻碍等等的论述，就指出了俄国民主革命的经济基础，工农结成联盟以反对地主和沙皇专制制度的经济基础，同时又使我们认识到俄国历史过程的中心问题，是推翻地主阶级的土地所有制，解决农民的土地问题。而解决土地问题的两条道路的斗争——即以无产阶级为领导的彻底扫清封建残余的革命道路和资产阶级的改良主义道路——又是决定俄国民主革命能否胜利的关键。俄国布尔什维克在一九○五到一九○七年的革命策略，正是根据这一分析而正确规定的。
    列宁对于俄国工业资本主义历史的考察，有力地击破了民粹派关于所谓“国民生产”，关于俄国工人阶级数量减少或者发展很慢等等虚伪的谰言。
    工业发展的事实是：小商品生产的手工业，正如在“农村公社”那里见到过的一样，不是什么“国民生产”制度，而是资本主义的最初幼芽。这样的小商品生产，一方面是小资产阶级，另一方面是雇佣工人。在作坊内，工人们是在小老板指挥下实行资本主义的协作。民粹派人为地把小商品生产和其他工业形式的联系割断，把资本主义工业只看成工厂工业，是完全错误的。
    在研究大机器工业底发展一章中，列宁在规定“工厂”这一科学概念之后，就以各个工业部门的统计数字，指明了工业增长尤其是工业集中的情况。列宁指出：大企业的工人数目，从一八六五年到一八九○年增加了两倍以上。“不仅比全体人民增加快得多，而且甚至比城市人口都要快。”民粹派应用错误的统计方法，以为俄国工厂数目在减少的胡说，完全破产了。
    本书最后一部分，是关于俄国国内市场形成的概论，也是对俄国资本主义发展的全部总结，同时，也就是最后宣布了民粹主义思想的全部歼灭。列宁从商品生产和商品流通统一的观点，揭示出运输、商业、工业人口，雇佣工人数目以及城市大量发展的情况。这就清楚地看出：俄国不论在农业和工业，都正在按照资本主义的道路前进，资本主义和国内市场正在不断增涨着。但同时，列宁又着重指出了封建残余对于资本主义生产的阻碍作用。俄国还是一个以农业为主的落后的国家。
    列宁在本书中所展开的全部论点，都是以“资本论”的原理为基础的。本书最突出的特点，在于整个地观察俄国经济发展的全部事实，研究它的各方面极其复杂的内在联系，给俄国资本主义的发展以完整的描述。就是这样，列宁表现为创造性的马克思主义者，真正拥护了马克思主义，发展了马克思主义。
    列宁在这本著作里面发展了马克思的政治经济思想，这表现在两个方面：一方面，列宁根据俄国资本主义的发展情况，把马克思在“资本论”中所已确定的观点加以论证，发挥，并且具体化；另一方面，正是由于对俄国经济的具体分析，又在普遍性的意义上发展了马克思的观点。这两个方面是统一在一起的，体现了理论和实际，一般和个别之间的相互联系。
    马克思在“资本论”中所讨论的问题，“是资本主义生产方法及其相应的生产关系和交换关系”（资本论初版序），主要的就是解剖剩余价值的生产、实现及其在剥削阶级间的分配。他在分析资本主义生产关系时，把前资本主义的种种因素舍掉，并以资本主义已经高度发展的英国为主要例解。列宁的“俄国资本主义底发展”，则从俄国的实际情况出发，主要的是研究资本主义生产关系的发生、发展。正是在这一方面，列宁就为马克思主义的宝库增加了新的财富。（附图片）
