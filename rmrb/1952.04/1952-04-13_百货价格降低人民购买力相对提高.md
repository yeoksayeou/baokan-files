Lower Commodity Prices Relatively Increase People's Purchasing Power
Wen Ying

The reasonable reduction in prices of nearly four thousand commodities by the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China National Department Store Company (and over ten thousand commodities in Shanghai) specifically demonstrates the tremendous gains of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the people's economic life. In state-owned enterprise departments, not only were embezzlers and bourgeois spies purged, purifying the internal workings of enterprises, but also the awareness of the vast majority of employees and workers was raised, and business operations were improved. The elimination of the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists has provided reliable guarantees for processed, ordered, and purchased goods, both in terms of quantity and quality. In this way, state-owned department stores can reasonably lower the prices of thousands of daily necessities needed by the people; the purchasing power of the people is relatively increased, and their lives are further improved.

Since April, with the reduction in prices of large quantities of goods, the sales volume of state-owned department stores in Beijing, as well as the many cooperatives they supply, has greatly increased. One can see crowded scenes of citizens buying goods in any of the state-owned department stores' outlets, retail stores, and cooperatives. Statistics on the sales volume of the First Department Store Branch of the Beijing Municipal Department Store Company in the past six days show that clothing sales exceeded the original plan by 145%, sock sales exceeded it by 44.27%, cloth sales exceeded it by 89.24%, towel sales exceeded it by 33%, and leather shoe sales exceeded it by 71.7%. One cooperative now sells more than twice as many goods each day as it did before April. The same is true of grassroots cooperatives in the rural suburbs. Looking at the goods being sold, cultural supplies, toothbrushes and toothpaste, cloth, shoes and socks, clothing, cigarettes, and other daily necessities are all selling well. Due to the expansion of business, department stores, retail companies, and cooperatives have either added outlets, reassigned staff, or even had to temporarily extend working hours. However, no matter how busy they are, the staff show no signs of fatigue; on the contrary, the busier they are, the more excited they become.

The reduction in prices relatively increased the people's purchasing power. The average daily sales amount of the Beijing Municipal Department Store outlets in early April was 528.12 million yuan, which, compared with before the price reduction, allows citizens to spend more than 39.6 million yuan less. This is not a small number and is a major event in the people's economic life. After the price reduction, it is first reflected in the lives of the vast majority of workers and farmers. The wife of Yuan Zhixing, a worker in a certain factory, bought each of her two school-age children a pair of Flower Basket brand socks, and a large Wufu cloth shirt for her husband, and also bought a four-foot-long piece of printed cloth. The changes in life have made a deep impression on her. Before liberation, her husband's salary was only equivalent to 360 jin of millet per month, which was not even enough to eat. After liberation, it gradually increased to 490 jin of millet by 1950. Now it has increased to 360 fen, equivalent to 720 jin of millet per month. His monthly expenditure on department store goods is about 100,000 yuan on average. After the price reduction, the same expenditure can buy 7,000 to 8,000 yuan more in department store goods, which invisibly increases his salary and further improves his life. This is a great encouragement to the workers' enthusiasm for production. The workers of the New China Confectionery Factory actively produced and launched the "Five-Anti" movement, which led to a 28% reduction in the price of the factory's confectionery sold by department stores. The workers said after seeing this situation: "Let's work even harder!" Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are also enthusiastically purchasing goods from cooperatives and department stores. They are sincerely happy about the reduction in department store prices. Sun Shifu, a model farmer from Xiaozhuang Village in the suburbs, said: "Department store goods are cheaper, which is thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership in the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, and also to the efforts of our worker brothers; we must also work harder to produce so that everyone can buy cheap grain."

At about the same time as the reduction in department store prices, supply-system cadres received increased subsidies. This means that when the lives of the masses are improved, the lives of the cadres will also be gradually improved. As Comrade Liu Tianyou of the First District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China said: "After the subsidies were issued, many comrades bought cloth to make clothes, some bought books, and some even bought beautiful leather shoes; their lives have indeed improved a step, because now there is this condition."

The reduction in commodity prices did not harm the reasonable profits of capitalists in the slightest; it was the result of eliminating the "five poisons" of the bourgeoisie. Taking the New China Confectionery Factory as an example, in the past, when the factory's capitalists were processing and ordering goods for the Beijing Municipal Department Store Company, they often used flour instead of milk powder, raw oil instead of butter, and alkali instead of eggs, reaping an average profit of 50%, and the profits of some products were as high as 120%. After the Beijing Municipal Department Store Company sent people to work with the workers to find the capitalists for detailed research, calculation, and repeated discussion, they obtained the factory's near-actual cost, which was 28% lower than the original, but the capitalists still had a profit of 21%.

The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have made the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-capital relations more normal, improved people's lives, and provided good conditions for future development of production.

    百货价格降低人民购买力相对提高
    文英
    中国百货公司北京市公司近四千种商品价格的合理降低（上海则已有一万多种商品价格降低了），具体表现了反贪污反盗窃运动在人民经济生活方面的巨大收获。在国营企业部门，不仅清洗了贪污分子和资产阶级的坐探，纯洁了企业的内部，而且提高了广大职员和工人的觉悟，改进了业务工作。违法资本家“五毒”的被清除，使加工、定货、收购的货品无论在量或质的方面，都得到了可靠的保证。这样，国营百货公司就能把人民所需求的成千种日用品的价格合理降低；人民的购买力相对地提高，生活得到进一步的改善。
    自四月以来，随着大批商品价格的降低，北京市的国营百货公司，以及它所供应的许多合作社的百货销售量大增，随便走进国营百货公司的那一个门市部、零售商店和合作社，都可以看到市民购买货物的拥挤情形。北京市百货公司第一门市部近六天来销货量的统计，服装销量超过原计划的百分之一四五，袜子销量超过百分之四四·二七，布匹销量超过百分之八九·二四，毛巾销量超过百分之三三，皮鞋销量超过百分之七一·七。一个合作社现在每天销售的百货比四月以前每天的销量增加了二倍多。市郊农村基层合作社，也是这样。从销售的商品来看，文化用具、牙刷牙膏、布匹、鞋袜、衣服、纸烟等日用品，都是畅销。由于业务的开展，百货公司、零售公司和合作社，有的增设了门市部，有的调配工作人员，有的甚至不得不暂时延长工作时间。但是，无论怎样忙，工作人员毫无疲劳的表现，相反地越忙越兴奋。
    物价的降低，相对地提高了人民购买力。北京市百货公司门市部四月上旬平均每日销货额为五亿二千八百一十二万元，这和价格降低以前相比较，可使市民少花三千九百六十多万元。这是个不小的数字，在人民经济生活中是一件大事。物价降低以后，首先反映在广大工人、农民的生活中。某厂工人袁志兴的妻子，给两个上学的孩子各添了一双花篮牌的袜子，给丈夫添了一件大五福布的衬衫，另外还买了一块四尺长的花布衣料。生活的变化给她的印象是深刻的。解放前，她的丈夫的工资每月只合三百六十斤小米，连吃都顾不上；解放后到一九五零年就逐渐提高到四百九十斤小米；现在每月增到三百六十分，折合小米七百二十斤；他每月购买百货的开支是平均十万元左右，物价降低后，同样开支可多买到七千元到八千元的百货，无形中又使工资增加了些，使生活改善再改善。这对工人生产的积极性是个很大的鼓励。新中国糖果厂的工人积极生产和开展“五反”运动，使百货公司所销售的该厂糖果价格降低了百分之二十八。工人们看到这种情形后说：“更加油干呵！”北京市郊农民们到合作社和百货公司购货也很踊跃。他们对百货价格的降低，是衷心欢喜的。市郊小庄村丰产模范孙士富说：“百货便宜了，这是毛主席对‘三反’‘五反’领导的好，也是工人兄弟们的功劳；我们也要更加努力生产，要大家买到便宜粮食。”
    和百货价格降低差不多同时，供给制干部增加了补贴。这就是说，当群众生活改善了的时候，干部们的生活也会逐步地得到改善。正如中共北京市第一区委员会刘天祜同志所说的：“发了补贴以后，很多同志买布做衣服以外，有的买书，有的还买了漂亮的皮鞋，生活确实提高了一步，这是因为现在有了这个条件。”
    商品价格的降低并没有丝毫损害资本家的合理利润；而是肃清资产阶级“五毒”的结果。就新中国糖果厂的例子来说，过去该厂资方在给北京市百货公司进行加工、定货时，常常用面粉代奶粉、生油代黄油、碱面代鸡蛋，平均牟取暴利百分之五十，某些产品利润最高的达百分之一百二十。经过北京市百货公司派人和工人一起找到资方详细研究、计算，反复讨论之后，得出该厂接近于实际的成本，较原来降低了百分之二十八，但资本家仍有百分之二十一的利润。
    “三反”“五反”运动使公私关系、劳资关系更趋正常，改善了人民生活，给今后发展生产提供了良好条件。
