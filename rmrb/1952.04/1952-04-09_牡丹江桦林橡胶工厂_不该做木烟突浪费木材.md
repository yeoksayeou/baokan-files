    Mudanjiang Hualin Rubber Factory
    Should Not Have Wasted Timber on Wooden Chimneys
    Editor: Last autumn, the Mudanjiang Hualin Rubber Factory in Northeast China built dormitories for its employees. Due to improper planning before construction, the dormitory chimneys experienced backdraft. However, the factory's leadership did not carefully study methods of rectification, but instead, seeking convenience, used pine wood allocated by the state to make wooden chimneys. The factory has 360 dormitory buildings, each with four wooden chimneys, making a total of 1,440 wooden chimneys. Each chimney used four pieces of timber, each four meters long, 20 centimeters wide, and 2 centimeters thick. Each piece is calculated as 0.016 cubic meters of wood, and all the chimneys used a total of 92.16 cubic meters of wood. This is a very serious waste!
    Regarding the conservation of timber, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions as early as last August. Moreover, wooden chimneys are extremely prone to fire, and recently, rural people have successively replaced wooden chimneys with adobe ones. However, the factory disregarded the state's timber conservation regulations and neglected fire prevention work, which is wrong. I suggest that the factory's higher-level leading department send someone to investigate and handle this matter.

### 牡丹江桦林橡胶工厂  不该做木烟突浪费木材

    牡丹江桦林橡胶工厂
    不该做木烟突浪费木材
    编辑同志：东北牡丹江桦林橡胶工厂在去年秋天修建员工宿舍，因修建前计划不当，使宿舍的烟突发生了反烟现象。但该厂负责人不细心研究修改方法，只图便当，便把国家调拨给他们的松木板材，拿来做木烟突。该厂有三百六十栋宿舍，每栋做四个木烟突，共做了一千四百四十个木烟突。每个烟突用四公尺长、二○公分宽、二公分厚的板材四块，每块以零点零一六立方公尺木材计算，全部烟突共用了九十二点一六立方公尺木材。这是多么严重的浪费！
    关于节约木材，中央人民政府政务院在去年八月早有指示。而且木烟突极易发生火灾，近来农村群众也都先后把木烟突改成土坯的了。可是该厂竟不顾国家节约木材的法令，忽视防火工作，这是错误的。我建议该厂上级领导部门，应派人调查处理。            孙洪涛
