Heilongjiang Hailun County No. 1 Department Store

Zhang Minru Actively Improves Sales Work

Zhang Minru is the group leader of the shop assistants in the No. 1 Department Store of Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province. She came from a poor family and only received three years of education. She learns humbly and works actively. Therefore, since she started working in 1950, she has been selected as a model worker six times. In her work, she treats customers very diligently, often patiently explaining the quality and specifications of various goods. When the villagers buy one item, she introduces three items, allowing them to compare and choose, so she is very popular among the masses.

Responding to the superior's call to "expand sales and accelerate capital turnover," Zhang Minru actively conducts business promotion and goes deep into various places to promote products. She actively contacts various government agencies, factories, and schools by telephone, thus achieving great sales results.

Zhang Minru often puts forward rationalization proposals. For example, she suggested that the leadership make the hard-to-sell fancy serge into quilt covers and mattress covers, thus turning cold goods into bestsellers. She used her spare time to lead other shop assistants to make cotton quilts and mattresses, which not only sold more than 2,000 feet of serge, but also sold more than 1,400 feet of white cloth and 600 catties of cotton. Therefore, everyone calls her a "sales expert." Wang Fengshu

    黑龙江海伦县第一百货商店
    张敏如积极改进推销工作
    张敏如是黑龙江省海伦县第一百货商店的店员组长。她出身于贫苦家庭，仅受过三年的文化教育。她虚心学习，积极工作，因此，自一九五零年参加工作后，曾六次被选为模范。她在工作中，对待顾主很殷勤，常耐心地向顾主们解释各种货物的质量、规格。老乡们买一样货，她就介绍三样货，让他们去比较、选择，因此很受群众的欢迎。
    张敏如响应上级“扩大卖钱额、加速资金周转”的号召，积极进行业务宣传，并深入各处去推销产品。她主动地打电话和各机关、工厂、学校联系，因而获得了很大的推销成绩。
    张敏如经常提出合理化建议。例如，她建议领导方面把不好销的花哔叽制成被面、褥面，这样就把冷货变成了畅销品。她利用业余时间，带动其他店员做棉被和褥子，不但卖掉了二千多尺哔叽，同时也卖掉一千四百多尺白布和六百斤棉花。因此，人人都称她是“推销能手”。　王凤舒
