Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th – At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 20th, our side pointed out that if the other side continues to adopt an attitude unwilling to resolve the issues on all agenda items and insists on unreasonable demands, the armistice negotiations will not be able to make any progress.

    Our chief staff officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, pointed out: "Our side has fully explained our firm position and reasonable solutions on all remaining issues of the third agenda item at the staff meeting and the subcommittee of the third agenda item. On the issue of neutral nation nominations, our side has put forward nominations that fully comply with the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both parties. Our side has even explicitly suggested that both parties simultaneously and in one go agree to all neutral nation nominations proposed by the other party, or that each party propose three neutral nations without any approval procedures. Your side has no reason to continue to oppose the nominations proposed by our side that fully comply with the definition of neutral nations. As for the so-called issue of restricting airport equipment within Korea, our side has long pointed out that this unreasonable demand attempting to interfere in our internal affairs is something that our side absolutely cannot consider. As our subcommittee representative pointed out, for the progress of the meeting, your side must withdraw this unreasonable demand. If your side continues to adopt an attitude of unwillingness to resolve the issues and insists on your unreasonable demands at the meetings of various agenda items, the armistice negotiations will not be able to make any progress."
    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, both sides continued to exchange opinions on the issue of prisoner repatriation.

    在朝鲜谈判第三项议程参谋会上
    我指斥美方拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方指出：如果对方继续在各项议程上采取不愿解决问题的态度，坚持无理要求，则停战谈判将不可能有任何进展。
    我方首席参谋张春山上校指出：“我方在第三项议程的参谋会议上和小组委员会上，都已经充分地说明了我方在第三项议程的一切剩余问题上的坚决立场和合理解决方案。在中立国提名问题上，我方提出了完全合乎双方协议的中立国定义的提名，我方更明确建议双方同时并一次同意对方所提出的全部中立国提名，或是双方各自提出三个中立国家而不进行任何同意手续。你方没有任何理由继续坚持反对我方所提出的完全合乎中立国定义的提名。至于所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的问题，我方早已指出这种企图干涉我方内政的无理要求，是我方所绝对不能考虑的。正如我方小组委员会代表所指出的，为了会议的进展，你方必须撤消这种无理要求。如果你方在各项议程的会议上，继续采取不愿解决问题的态度，坚持你方的无理要求，停战谈判是不可能有任何进展的。”
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方就遣俘问题继续交换意见。
