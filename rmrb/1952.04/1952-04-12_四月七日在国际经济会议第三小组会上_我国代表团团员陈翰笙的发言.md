    Currently, a considerable portion of the world consists of regions that are economically undeveloped or only slightly developed. They possess abundant natural resources and occupy a very important position in the world economy. These countries also have diligent and brave people who produce and supply raw materials and food needed by many countries. Both in the past and present, they have made huge contributions to the development of the world economy and international trade. If their industrial and agricultural production can receive due development in the future, and if they can establish normal and rational economic and trade relations with other countries, it will not only improve the living standards of the people in these countries but also make a greater contribution to the world economy and trade. Their potential production capacity and the possible expansion of their markets are unlimited.

    However, the economic development of these countries is currently disproportionate to the resources and manpower they possess. They either have no national industry at all or have only extremely weak national industries. Their agricultural production was originally backward, and now it is declining. Their production and trade are now in a very abnormal state. Many of the things they produce cannot be sold, which forces many production sectors to contract further. The jute industry in India, rubber in Ceylon, Indonesia, and Malaya, and tin production in the latter two are obvious examples. The result of this situation in many underdeveloped countries is what we all see now: shrinking international trade, fluctuating prices, declining production, inflation, declining living standards, and increasing unemployment and disasters. For example, according to the 1951 statistics of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, if the minimum average daily nutritional requirement is 2,800 to 3,000 calories, then India only has 1,600 and Indonesia only has 1,950. Currently, India is still experiencing severe famine, with tens of millions of people facing the threat of starvation. In some other underdeveloped countries, there is also a threat of famine. This serious situation not only causes losses and suffering to the people of these countries but also greatly affects the development of international economy and trade. Therefore, the problems of underdeveloped countries cannot but attract our attention.

    Undoubtedly, blockade and embargo are important reasons for the current economic difficulties of underdeveloped countries. For example, take Malaya. The production and export of rubber accounts for a very large proportion of its national economy, but as a result of blockade and embargo, Malayan rubber products have lost many important markets. The price of rubber has been artificially manipulated and has fallen sharply. As a result, Malayan rubber exports have decreased, and production has been reduced. As everyone knows, in the short period from February to August last year alone, the price of rubber in London fell from seven shillings per pound to three shillings and eight pence per pound. According to official announcements, Malayan rubber exports in January this year were more than 21,000 tons less than in December last year, and rubber production last year was more than 90,000 tons less than the previous year.

    This example is well known to everyone, and the situation of the rubber industry in Ceylon and Indonesia is roughly the same. Not to mention the production and trade situation of other commodities such as tin and jute.

    Obviously, the economic and trade recovery and development of underdeveloped countries and the improvement of people's living standards are incompatible with this policy. Therefore, the people of underdeveloped countries, including the industrialists and businessmen in these countries, have risen up to demand the development of their national industries, to develop normal trade with all countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and to lift trade monopolies and embargoes. We believe that this demand is reasonable, is the wish of the people of these countries, is beneficial to their own countries, is beneficial to the development of international economy and trade, and is beneficial to the cause of world peace. Therefore, the Chinese people express great sympathy and support for this demand.

    We Chinese people have always been willing to develop trade relations with all these countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Our trade relations with Asian countries have a long history. In the past, we used to supply minerals, salt, silk, agricultural products, and various daily necessities and handicrafts to Asian countries. We also purchased rubber, cotton, cotton cloth, petroleum, timber, jute bags, quinine, and other means of production and means of livelihood from them. China used to be an important market for many products of Asian countries. This trade relationship between us has been of great benefit to the economic development of all countries. Now we have established peaceful and friendly diplomatic relations and equal and mutually beneficial commercial relations with India, Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We also have regular trade relations with Ceylon and Malaya. Ceylon's non-participation in the embargo is welcomed by the Chinese people. Although some countries are creating artificial obstacles between us and Asian countries, we hope that we can break through these obstacles and further develop our trade with each other. Undoubtedly, commodities such as rubber, cotton, jute, quinine, and many other products can find good sales and obtain reasonable prices in our country. Due to the rapid development of our country's production and construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the scope and quantity of our trade with the above-mentioned countries may gradually increase. We have had some trade relations with countries in the Near East, Middle East, and Latin America in the past and present, and we hope that this relationship can be developed. We believe that there is a broad prospect for the development of our commodity exchange and trade relations with all countries.

    We believe that developing normal international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit has a great role to play in improving the economic situation of underdeveloped countries and raising the living standards of the people. The primary issue now is for everyone to work together to remove obstacles to international trade and the exchange of people's necessities; to allow the exports of all countries to be sold to customers who offer reasonable prices, rather than being forced to sell at low prices; and at the same time, to allow all countries to import goods that are reasonably priced and needed by their own countries, rather than being forced to import monopolized and even unnecessary goods; in short, to allow all countries to develop equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with other countries based on their national interests, without being subject to any external restrictions. We believe that only in this way can international trade develop normally and the economic situation of underdeveloped countries be improved. The Chinese people are willing to develop trade relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. As long as other countries have the same desire as us, our normal trade relations with all countries will surely develop.

### 四月七日在国际经济会议第三小组会上  我国代表团团员陈翰笙的发言

    四月七日在国际经济会议第三小组会上
    我国代表团团员陈翰笙的发言
    目前世界上有相当大的一部分地区是属于经济不发展或很少发展地区。他们拥有丰富的自然资源，在世界经济上占着非常重要的地位。这些国家也有着勤劳勇敢的人民，生产了并供给了许多国家所需要的原料和食物。不论在过去和现在，他们对世界经济和国际贸易的发展，都有巨大的贡献。如果他们的工农业生产，今后能得到应有的发展，与其他各国能建立正常与合理的经济和贸易关系，那就不仅使这些国家的人民生活水平可以得到提高，而且对世界经济与贸易，还可作出更大的贡献。他们潜在的生产能力与可能扩展的市场，是无限的。
    然而现在这些国家的经济发展与他们所拥有的资源和人力却是不相称的。他们或者完全没有或者仅有发展极其微弱的民族工业。他们的农业生产本来就很落后，而且现在还在日趋萎缩。他们的生产和贸易现在正处在极不正常的状态中，他们生产出来的许多东西卖不出去，因而使许多生产部门不得不再紧缩，印度的制麻工业，锡兰、印尼与马来亚的树胶，以及后二者的锡产就是明显的例子。这种情况在许多发展迟缓国家里所造成的结果，就是我们大家现在所看到的：国际贸易萎缩，物价波动，生产低落，通货膨胀，生活水平下降，失业增长，天灾人祸。例如以联合国粮农组织一九五一年的统计资料来看，如果平均每人每日的最低营养额为二千八百到三千卡罗里，那么印度只有一千六百，印尼只有一千九百五十。目前印度还存在着严重的灾荒，处于饥饿威胁下的人数达数千万之多。在其他有些发展迟缓国家里，同样也存在着灾荒的威胁。这种严重情况不仅使各该国的人民蒙受到损失和痛苦，而且反过来又大大地影响了国际经济与贸易的发展。所以发展迟缓国家的问题，就不能不引起我们的注意。
    无疑的，封锁禁运是造成当前发展迟缓国家经济困难的重要原因。譬如拿马来亚说，树胶的生产与输出在它的国民经济中占有极大的比重，但由于受到封锁与禁运的结果，遂使马来亚橡胶产品失掉了许多重要市场。树胶的价格受到了人为的操纵而惨跌。于是马来亚树胶的输出下降了，生产缩减了。如大家所知道的，仅去年二月到八月这一短期间内，伦敦的胶价就从每磅七先令跌到每磅三先令八便士。今年一月马来亚的树胶输出，据官方公布，已比去年十二月少二万一千多吨，而去年树胶的产量则较前年减少九万多吨。
    这一例子是大家所熟知的，而且锡兰、印尼的胶树业情况也大致如此。其他诸如锡、黄麻的生产与贸易情况，就不用说了。
    很显然，发展迟缓国家经济、贸易的恢复与发展以及人民生活的改善，是与这种政策不相容的。因此，发展迟缓国家的人民，包括这些国家里的工商业家们，已起来要求发展自己的民族工业，要求在平等互利的原则下与一切国家发展正常的贸易，解除贸易上的垄断与禁运，我们认为这种要求是合理的，是这些国家人民的愿望，是有利于他们本国，有利于国际经济与贸易的发展，有利于全世界的和平事业的。所以中国人民对这种要求表示极大的同情和赞助。
    我们中国人民历来就愿意与所有这些国家，在平等互利的基础上，发展贸易关系。我们与亚洲各国的贸易关系有着悠久的历史。我们过去曾以矿产食盐丝绸农产品以及各种日用品与工艺品供应亚洲各国。我们也曾购进他们所出产的树胶、棉花、棉布、石油、木材、麻袋、奎宁及其他生产资料与生活资料。中国过去曾是亚洲国家许多生产品的重要市场。我们相互之间的这种贸易关系，对各国经济的发展，都有过很大益处。现在我们与印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印尼、越南民主共和国都已建立了和平友好的外交关系及平等互利的商务关系。我们与锡兰、马来亚也有着经常的贸易关系，锡兰之未参加禁运，更为中国人民所欢迎，虽然某些国家正在我们与亚洲各国之间制造着人为的障碍，但我们希望，我们能够打破这种障碍，而进一步发展我们相互间的贸易。无疑的，如像橡胶、棉花、黄麻、奎宁及其他许多产品，既可在我国找到很好的销路，又可得到合理的价格。由于我国生产建设的飞跃发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，我们与上述各国的贸易范围与数量都可能逐渐增加。我们与近东、中东及拉丁美洲各国，在过去和现在都有若干贸易关系，我们也希望这种关系，能够发展起来。我们相信，我们与各国间的货物交换与贸易关系，是存在着广阔发展的前途。
    我们认为在平等互利的基础上发展正常的国际贸易，对于改善发展迟缓国家的经济情势及提高人民的生活水平有着极大的作用。现在首要的问题就是要大家共同努力，以解除国际贸易与人民生活必需品的交换上的障碍；让各国的输出品能够卖给出合理价格的主顾，而不是被迫以低价出售；同时让各国输入合理价格的并为本国所需要的货物，而不是被迫输入垄断价格的以至不需要的货物；总之让各国能根据其民族的利益与其他国家发展平等互惠的贸易关系，而不受到外来的任何限制。我们相信，只有这样，国际贸易才会得到正常发展，发展迟缓国家的经济情况才能得到改善。我们中国人民是愿意在平等互利的基础上与一切国家发展贸易关系的。只要其他国家也与我们有同样的愿望，我们与各国的正常贸易关系是一定会发展起来的。
