The leadership of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University has, for more than two years, used a revolutionary spirit and methods to build the school, saving the country more than 500 million yuan in wealth and enabling the school to continuously develop. At the same time, by participating in labor, students have gained better opportunities for training and transformation, becoming talents for national construction.

After the liberation of Xi'an in 1949, the Northwest People's Revolutionary University moved from Yan'an to Xi'an, borrowing part of the Yutai Yarn Factory and Northeast New Village as temporary school buildings. These houses already lacked doors and windows and were in disrepair; but the school had to start classes on time, so what to do? The leadership mobilized all cadres and students to help transport wood and bricks, repair school buildings, pave roads, and open up sports fields, which ensured that the school could open quickly.

Soon, the school moved to Yongledian and Tongyuanfang. During the relocation process, cadres and students walked ten or even thirty miles to help the school load and unload six hundred zhang of wooden boards and twelve train cars of school equipment. The school buildings in Yongledian were originally factory buildings of a packaging plant. The five warehouses were filled with water, and wood and broken machinery were piled everywhere, with weeds growing one or two feet high outside. In order to start classes on time, the leadership called on everyone to take action and build the school themselves. The students enthusiastically responded to this call, demonstrating a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Everyone proposed: "Complete the four-day school construction task in three days." The students carried wood, moved bricks, and paved the ground, quickly repairing dormitories that could accommodate more than 1,000 people. There was no playground here, so the students found open space, removed weeds, leveled the ground, and opened up a ball field; the well water was not enough, so the students automatically dug wells. After three days of construction work, the surrounding areas of the school had changed from their past desolate appearance, presenting a new atmosphere.

In order to build the campus, the students found open space, did it themselves, dug ponds, built thatched pavilions, and planted flowers and trees around them, turning wasteland into a paradise - "New Life Garden."

Around the Northwest People's Revolutionary University's First and Third Divisions, many places originally had no walls, so the students built earthen walls themselves. They had no experience in building earthen walls, so they learned from the worker comrades and quickly mastered the technology. In order to take care of the health of some female students, the school did not allow them to participate in heavy labor; but they still participated in labor like the male students. They built more than one hundred zhang of earthen walls. The students of the First Division also used their spare time to grow vegetables to supply the next group of students.

Last spring, the Finance Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee approved more than 700 million yuan for school construction for the Northwest People's Revolutionary University. In order to make this limited money have a greater effect, the school leadership established a construction committee responsible for planning the school construction work. During the construction process, the school leadership mobilized students and staff to participate in the transportation work. Everyone transported a total of 70,000 adobe bricks, 200,000 bricks, and 480,000 tiles. In addition, the construction committee sent people to the production area to purchase building materials (where the price of certain materials was two-fifths cheaper than in Xi'an) in order to save expenses for the country. After the start of construction, the leadership sent special personnel to supervise and inspect the work. As a result, 184 new rooms were built, averaging only more than 4 million yuan per room. If it were contracted to private construction companies at the market price at the time, each room would cost at least 6 million yuan, then more than 700 million yuan could only build more than 120 rooms, 50 fewer rooms. Calculating this item alone, it saved the country more than 340 million yuan. In early autumn last year, the school sent people to Hanzhong to enroll students, recruiting more than 100 new students. When coming to school, these new students were led by cadres from Hanzhong to Baoji on foot, which saved the country more than 20 million yuan in travel expenses.

Until now, the equipment of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University is still simple. The three large classrooms are still made of reed mats. There are no desks in class, so the students use two-foot square wooden boards - "learning boards" to record the contents of the lectures. The buildings of the First and Third Divisions were originally warehouses, which were later repaired. There were no ceilings on them, and the partitions were also made of reeds. Group meetings could not be held in the dormitories, so for most of the year, students held meetings and studied outdoors. In severe winter, one group studied outdoors and one group studied indoors, taking turns using the rooms. Especially on rainy days, the reed sheds leaked, affecting classes (now tarpaulins have been added, and classes can be held even when it rains). In order not to delay learning, the loudspeakers were installed under the corridor, and the students sat under the corridor to listen to the lectures. But all this did not affect the completion of the teaching plan.

This spirit of hard work and simplicity of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University is permeated in all aspects and in the lives of all personnel. For example, when the school moved from Xi'an to Tongyuanfang, the water used by cadres and students was all in one place, and boiling water was often not available. Seven stoves burned about 1,100 kilograms of coal every day, consuming a lot. Later, in order to save water, the stoves were divided into two parts: cadre stoves and student stoves; but the problem was not completely solved. Cook Li Zeng, who was in charge of the cadre stove at the time, developed the spirit of overcoming difficulties and actively thought of ways to change the stove to a long shape, so that one fire could boil the water in three pots. This made supplying boiling water much faster than before, and only more than 100 kilograms of coal were burned every day. Then the student stove was also changed, and the two stoves could save more than 20,000 kilograms of coal per month. In the past, cooks had to fetch water from a distance, and Li Zeng and two other comrades dug a well next to the stove, which saved a lot of time fetching water. Later, the cook Xing Hei installed the windlass frame at the well on a wooden frame higher than the stove, and a wooden box was set on the frame. One end of the box was connected with a bamboo pole (the bamboo pole was completely hollowed out). Water was drawn from the frame and poured into the wooden box, and the water flowed into the pot along the bamboo pole. These technical improvements not only saved coal, but also reduced the number of cooks managing the water stoves by three.

This spirit of hard struggle of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University is a direct inheritance and development of the fine traditions of its predecessor, Yan'an University. The main cadres of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University came from Yan'an University. They adhered to the educational policy of Yan'an University that combines teaching with practice, and their bodies directly embodied the spirit of hard work of Yan'an University. (Attached picture)

### 西北人民革命大学是怎样用革命精神建设学校的

    西北人民革命大学是怎样用革命精神建设学校的
    西北人民革命大学的领导方面，二年多来用革命的精神和办法建设学校，为国家节省了五亿元以上的财富，并使学校不断发展；同时通过参加劳动，使学员们获得了更好的锻炼和改造的机会，成为国家建设的人材。
    一九四九年西安解放后，西北人民革命大学由延安搬到西安，借用裕泰纱厂和东北新村的一部分房屋作为临时校舍。这些房屋已经缺门少窗，破烂不堪；但是学校要按时开课，怎么办呢？领导方面就发动了全体干部和学员帮助搬运木料和砖瓦，修补校舍，铺平道路，开辟了运动场，这就保证了学校能够很快的开学。
    不久，学校迁设永乐店和通远坊两地。在迁校过程中，干部和同学步行十里甚至三十里路，帮助学校装卸了六百丈木板和十二个车皮的校具。永乐店的校舍，原是一家打包厂的厂房，五幢库房里面积满了水，木材和破烂机器堆集一地，屋外长着一、二尺高的杂草。为了按时开课，领导方面号召大家动手，自己建校。同学们热烈地响应了这一号召，表现了很高的劳动热情，大家提出：“四天建校任务，争取三天完成。”同学们抬木料，搬砖铺地，很快修好了可以住一千多人的宿舍。这里没有操场，同学们自己找空地，动手除草平地，开辟了球场；井水不够用，同学们自动挖井。建校工作进行了三天，校院四周已改变了过去的荒芜面貌，呈现出一片新的气象。
    为了建设校园，同学们找到空地，自己动手，挖掘水池，盖起茅亭，周围种植花木，把荒地变成了乐园——“新生园”。
    西北人民革命大学一、三两部的周围，原先很多地方没有墙，同学们就自己动手打土墙。他们没有打土墙的经验，就向工人同志学习，很快地掌握了技术。校方为了照顾部分女同学的身体，不让她们参加笨重的劳动；可是她们仍然和男同学一样地参加了劳动。她们共打了一百多丈的土墙。第一部同学还利用课余时间种菜，供给下一期的同学们吃用。
    去年春天，西北军政委员会财政部批准了西北人民革命大学的七亿多元的学校修建费。学校领导方面为了使这有限的钱，发挥更大的效果，便成立了修建委员会，负责计划建校工作。在建校过程中，学校领导方面动员学员和工作人员参加了搬运工作。大家共搬运了七万块土坯，二十万块砖，四十八万片瓦。另外，修建委员会派人到产地去购买建筑材料（那里，某些材料的价格比西安要便宜五分之二），以便为国家节省经费。开工之后，领导方面派专人进行监工和检查，结果新建了房屋一百八十四间，平均每间只花了四百多万元。若以当时的市价包给私营的营造厂，每间至少需要六百万元，则七亿多万元只能盖一百二十多间房，少盖五十多间。单以这一项计算，就为国家节省了三亿四千多万元。去年初秋，学校派人到汉中招生，共招收了一百多名新同学。在来学校时，这些新同学都是由干部带领从汉中步行到宝鸡的，这样就为国家节省了车费两千多万元。
    直到现在，西北人民革命大学的设备仍然是简陋的。三个大教室还是用芦席盖成的。上课没有桌子，同学们就用二尺见方的木板——“学习板”纪录着讲课的内容。一、三两部的房屋，原是仓库，后来加以修补，上面没有顶棚，隔壁也是用芦苇作成的。宿舍内不能开小组会，因此，一年中的大部分时间，同学们都在室外开会学习。严冬，一组在屋外，一组在屋内轮流利用屋子学习。尤其在雨天，芦苇棚漏水，影响上课（现在已加盖油毛毡，下雨也可上课了），为了不耽误学习，就将扩音器装在走廊下面，同学们坐在廊下听课。但这一切都没有影响教学计划的完成。
    西北人民革命大学的这种坚苦朴素的作风，是贯串在各个方面和全体人员生活中的。如学校从西安迁到通远坊时，干部和学员的用水都在一块，开水经常供应不上。七个炉灶每天烧煤炭一千一百斤左右，消耗很大。后来为了节约用水，将灶分成两部：干部灶和学员灶；但问题并没有得到彻底解决。炊事员李璔当时管理干部灶，他发扬了克服困难的精神，积极想办法，把炉灶改成长型，生一个火就能将三个锅的水烧开。这样供应开水要比过去快得多，而且每天只烧一百多斤煤炭。接着又把学员灶也改变了，两个灶每个月就能节省煤二万多斤。过去炊事员要到远处去挑水，李璔和其他两位同志在炉灶旁开掘了一口井，这样又节省了许多挑水的时间。后来，炊事员邢黑，又把井边的辘轳架装在一个高于炉灶的木架上面，架上设了一个木箱，箱的一端用竹竿衔接（竹竿完全挖空），从架上汲水倒入木箱，水就顺竹竿流向锅内。上面这一些的技术改进，不但节省了用煤，同时也减去了三个管理水灶的炊事员。
    西北人民革命大学这种坚苦奋斗的精神，是直接继承和发扬了它的前身延安大学的优良传统的。西北人民革命大学的主要干部是从延安大学来的，他们坚持了延安大学的教学联系实际的教育方针，并由他们身上直接体现了延安大学的艰苦作风。（附图片）
