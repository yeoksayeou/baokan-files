This issue includes the Chinese Medical Association's "Common Knowledge of Epidemic Prevention," as well as two pieces of information, a propaganda poster, and a song. This issue also includes Li Pu's "Are the Regulations on Dealing with Embezzlement and Theft 'Too Lenient'?" This Q&A explains some of the questions the masses have about the regulations on dealing with embezzlement and theft. In addition, there are two pieces of information and a set of comic strips.
    This issue also includes two "Current Affairs Q&A," one on the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle and the other on the Japanese people's opposition to American aggression.
    ▲ According to investigations, there are many ancient relics buried underground in the Jingjiang area of ​​Central South China. This time, the Jingjiang flood diversion project is building sluice gates and repairing embankments, and the area for soil extraction is vast. Therefore, it is necessary to organize, lead, and plan the protection of cultural relics and monuments during the construction of the project. The Cultural Relics Management Office of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters has now been established. At the same time, instructions on the protection of cultural relics and monuments were issued. The instructions pointed out: Cultural relics and monuments are the achievements created by the working people of our motherland with infinite wisdom and sweat. From cultural relics and monuments, we can see the long history and splendid culture of our nation, and thereby recognize the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. Therefore, it is required that cadres, migrant workers, and military workers participating in this project, when encountering stone tablets, steles, stone carvings, stone figures, stone beasts, and ancient buildings (such as pavilions, terraces, temples, etc.) in their work, should protect them well and report to superiors and relevant units for handling.
