    Paris "Tonight's Paper" Reporter Reports
    The U.S. Conspires to Detain Our Captured Personnel
    Using Torture to Force Them to Write Blood Letters
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd] Paris "Tonight's Paper" reporter Bei Que Di reported from Kaesong: On the morning of the 20th, the staff officers for agenda item three resumed discussions, while the staff officers for agenda item four held their second meeting after the "Administrative Conference" reconvened. Simultaneously, U.S. shells exploded only two hundred yards away from the Panmunjom safety zone. Colonel Zhang Chunshan reiterated the Korean and Chinese side's attitude towards nominating the Soviet Union as a neutral nation and the airfield issue, and warned the U.S. side that if they continue to adopt an unwilling attitude to resolve problems "in the meetings on various agenda items" and persist in unreasonable demands, no progress would be possible.

    Although there is no news about the situation of the fourth agenda item meeting, the U.S. side's activities outside the meeting tent indicate that they still intend to detain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the pretext of "voluntary repatriation." The U.S. side chose to force prisoners of war to sign blood letters demanding to be allowed to "fight the communist aggressors to the end" at the time of resuming negotiations on this agenda item. The latest batch of 8,000 signatures is said to have been transferred to the United Nations delegation yesterday. This can only be regarded as the most serious provocation by the U.S. side at a delicate stage of the negotiations. Captured secret agents reported the details of the U.S. side's use of torture and terror methods to force prisoners of war to sign blood letters and force them to tattoo their bodies. Other ominous signs are: America's allies have been protesting that America's "voluntary repatriation" demands violate the Geneva Convention, but the United States dismisses its allies' protests with contempt. All of these indicate that they intend to detain a large number of prisoners of war. Obviously, the optimistic news released by Washington and Tokyo is to deceive the eyes of the United States' anxious allies, who demand that the United States remove the obstacles it deliberately sets to hinder the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement.

    For nine months, I have been reporting on these negotiations every day. I have found that the only reason for creating this optimistic atmosphere is to make public opinion and its allies feel that there is no need to be alarmed by the U.S. side's negotiation style. In fact, there is every reason to be alarmed, because they are once again being led into a dangerous situation. The U.S. side allows the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang's executioners to take the most brutal terrorist actions against prisoners of war who demand release and repatriation. The U.S. side is afraid of public opinion expressing opinions on this issue. They have a guilty conscience about the events that happened on Koje Island. Their demand for "voluntary repatriation" cannot stand the test of public opinion. Only by continuing to exert pressure can the U.S. side be forced to abandon any idea they still hold of detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Only when they abandon this idea and are prepared to negotiate other issues can a ceasefire in Korea be achieved.

    巴黎“今晚报”记者报道
    美方阴谋扣留我被俘人员
    竟用酷刑强迫他们写血书
    【新华社二十二日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌自开城报道：二十日上午，第三项议程参谋人员恢复讨论，而第四项议程的参谋人员则在“行政会议”复会后举行第二次会议。同时，美方炮弹落在离板门店安全区只有二百码远的地方爆炸。张春山上校重申朝中方面对提名苏联为中立国和机场问题的态度，并警告美方说，假如他们“在各项议程的会议上”继续采取不愿解决问题的态度而坚持无理的要求，那是不可能有任何进展的。
    第四项议程的会议情况虽没有任何消息，但美方在会议帐篷外的活动，表明他们仍打算在“自愿遣返”的藉口下扣留大量朝中战俘。美方选定在恢复这项议程的谈判的时候，强迫战俘签写要求准许“与共产党侵略者作战到底”的血书。最近一批八千人的签名书据说昨天已转给联合国代表团了。这只能认为是美方在谈判进入微妙阶段时的一个最严重的挑衅。被俘的特务报告了美方使用酷刑和恐怖方法强使战俘签写血书及强迫在战俘身上刺字的详细情况。其他不祥的迹象是：美国的盟友已在抗议美国的“自愿遣返”要求违反日内瓦公约，而美国却把它的盟友的抗议轻蔑地置之脑后。所有这些，表明了他们打算扣留大量战俘。很显然，华盛顿和东京所发表的乐观消息，是为了蒙蔽美国的心急的盟友的眼睛，这些盟友要求美方撤除它故意设置的阻挠获致停战协议的障碍。
    九个月来我天天采访这些谈判的消息，我发现制造这种乐观气氛的唯一原因是要使舆论和它的盟友感觉用不着对美方谈判的作风感到惊恐。事实上是完全有理由惊恐的，因为它们正再一次地被引到危险的境地。美方放任国民党和李承晚匪帮的刽子手对要求释放和遣返的战俘采取最残酷的恐怖行动。美方害怕舆论对这个问题表示意见。他们对巨济岛发生的事件作贼心虚。他们提出的“自愿遣返”的要求是经不起舆论的检查的。唯有再继续施用压力才能迫使美方放弃他们仍然抱有的扣留朝中战俘的任何想法。唯有当他们放弃这种想法并准备谈判其他问题时，朝鲜的停战才能实现。
