(News from our newspaper) Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: The Soviet people welcomed the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) to lower food prices once again (for the fifth time) with extreme satisfaction and gratitude. This decision vividly demonstrates the various achievements of the socialist national economy and is yet another manifestation of the Soviet state's concern for continuously improving the people's living standards.

The working people of factories, institutions, and universities in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Riga, and many other cities spontaneously held grand rallies on March 31, all firmly expressing their determination to repay the care of the Party and the government with new labor achievements and further improvements in labor productivity.

Moscow "Dynamo" factory assembler Vasilyev said at a workshop meeting: My family bought things worth about 10,000 rubles last year alone. Now, we will live even better. In order to repay the country's fatherly care for us, I guarantee to overfulfill the daily production task. Donbas Kalinin mine coal miner Kilikov said at the miners' congress of the mine: Reducing prices gives Soviet workers and staff great benefits. "Such achievements are only possible in a country where all forces are directed towards peaceful construction. We will continue to expand our wealth with our Stakhanovite labor." At the workers' congress of the Kishinev inspection plant in Moldova, train driver Antonov said: "When American imperialists spend hundreds of billions of dollars squeezed from the working people to prepare for a new world war, the Soviet government expresses constant concern for the people and reduces food prices. Our real wages have increased again!"

This time, the Soviet Union's reduction in prices, along with the reduction in food prices in collective farm markets and cooperatives, means a total savings of 28 billion rubles for the people.

Furthermore: The Soviet Union once again lowered prices starting from April 1, and the prices of books, including textbooks, were also reduced accordingly. Retail prices of books were reduced by an average of 18 percent. Prices of university textbooks, medical books, and research books were reduced by 20 percent. The prices of books published by local book publishing bureaus were reduced by 30 to 40 percent.

    【本报讯】综合新华社消息：苏联人民以极度满意和感激的心情欢迎苏联部长会议和苏联共产党
    （布）中央委员会关于再一次（第五次）减低食物价格的决定。这个决定生动地证明了社会主义国民经济的种种成就，并且是苏维埃国家关心不断改善人民生活水准的又一表现。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、第比利斯、里加及其他许多城市的工厂、机关、高等学校的劳动人民，都在三月三十一日自动地举行盛大的集会，他们都坚决表示要以新的劳动成就和进一步提高劳动生产率来报答党和政府的关怀。
    莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂装配工人瓦西里也夫在车间会议上说：我的家庭仅在去年一年就买了约值一万卢布的东西。现在，我们要生活得更美好了。为了报答国家对我们像父亲般的关怀，我保证超额完成每天的生产任务。顿巴斯加里宁矿场煤矿工人基利科夫在该矿场的工人大会上说：减低物价使苏联工人和职员获得了很大的利益，“只有在一切力量都被引导到和平建设方面去的一个国家，这种成就才是可能的。我们将用我们的斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动继续扩大我们的财富。”在摩尔达维亚基希涅夫检车厂的工人大会上，火车司机安托诺夫说：“当美国帝国主义者花在从劳动人民身上榨取的几百亿美元准备一次新的世界大战的时候，苏联政府对人民表示不断的关切，减低食品价格。我们的实际工资又增加啦！”
    苏联这次减低物价，集体农场市场和合作社的食品价格也跟着降低，意味着为人民节省了总共二百八十亿卢布。
    又讯：苏联从四月一日起再次减低物价，包括教科书在内的书籍价格也相应减低。书籍零售价格平均减低百分之十八。高等学校教科书、医学图书和研究用书价格减低百分之二十。各地方书籍出版局所出图书的价格减低百分之三十到四十。
