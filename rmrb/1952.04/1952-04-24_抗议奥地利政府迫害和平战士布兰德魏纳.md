    Protest the Austrian Government's Persecution of Peace Fighter Brandweiner
    Recently, at the behest of U.S. imperialism, the Austrian government has unscrupulously persecuted Brandweiner, an outstanding peace fighter and head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team on U.S. war crimes, and has dismissed him from his position as a professor at the University of Graz. This crime by the Austrian reactionaries has aroused protests from the broad masses of the Austrian people and will inevitably arouse the anger of peace-loving people all over the world.
    Not long ago, Brandweiner led an investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to Korea and China to conduct on-the-spot investigations into the U.S. aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons and other war crimes. The investigation team obtained a large amount of conclusive evidence of the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. As legal workers and peace-loving people, the members of the investigation team denounced the U.S. aggressors' heinous crimes to the world. Brandweiner and his colleagues' efforts in investigating U.S. war crimes effectively exposed the U.S. aggressors' crimes of large-scale slaughter of humanity and made an important contribution to the world peace movement.
    The numerous pieces of evidence revealed by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers exposed the ugly deeds of the U.S. germ warfare criminals. This could not but cause their panic and fear. Therefore, they instructed their Austrian servants to persecute this outstanding peace fighter and witness to the U.S. crimes of aggression.
    The persecution of Brandweiner once again proves that the U.S. aggressors have a guilty conscience and fear that the people of the world will know the truth about the heinous crimes they committed in Korea and China. However, this barbaric and brutal behavior of the U.S. aggressors will not only fail to cover up their heinous crimes but will instead make their crimes even more evident. Last summer, the British government also persecuted Mrs. Felton, a member of the International Women's Investigation Team on the atrocities of the U.S. and Rhee Syngman troops in Korea, for the same reason, but this did not in the slightest way frustrate Mrs. Felton's will to continue to convey the truth about Korea to the British people. Mrs. Felton's courageous actions have won the love and support of millions of peace-loving people around the world. Similarly, the Austrian reactionaries' persecution of Brandweiner can only cause Brandweiner's just actions in exposing the crimes of the U.S. aggressors to receive more support and endorsement from peace-loving humanity; it can only increase the anger and hatred of peace-loving people all over the world towards the U.S. aggressors, and make them more determined to wage unremitting struggles to stop germ warfare.
    The Chinese people firmly protest the Austrian reactionaries' persecution of Brandweiner. We extend our infinite sympathy to the heroic peace fighter Brandweiner. The Chinese people are determined to stand together with peace-loving people all over the world to support the Austrian people's protest struggle.

    抗议奥地利政府迫害和平战士布兰德魏纳
    最近，奥地利政府按照美帝国主义的意旨，对杰出的和平战士、国际民主法律工作者协会调查美国战争罪行调查团团长布兰德魏纳实行无耻迫害，解除了他的格拉茨大学教授的职位。奥地利反动派的这一罪行，已引起奥地利广大人民的抗议，也必将引起全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒。
    不久以前，布兰德魏纳曾率领国际民主法律工作者调查团到朝鲜和我国，对美国侵略者使用细菌武器以及其他战争罪行进行了实地调查。调查团获得了美国侵略者对朝鲜和我国人民进行细菌战的大量而确凿的罪证，调查团团员们曾以法律工作者和爱好和平人民的身份，向全世界控诉了美国侵略者的滔天罪行。布兰德魏纳和他的同伴们在调查美国战争罪行这一工作上所做的努力，有力地揭露了美国侵略者大规模屠杀人类的罪行，对世界保卫和平运动作了重要的贡献。
    国际民主法律工作者调查团所揭发的累累罪证，使美国细菌战罪犯们的丑行毕露。这就不能不引起他们的恐慌和畏惧。因此，他们指使其奥地利仆从对这个杰出的和平战士、美国侵略罪行的见证人进行迫害。
    布兰德魏纳被迫害一事，又一次证明美国侵略者做贼心虚，害怕全世界人民知道他们在朝鲜和我国犯下的滔天罪行的真相。可是，美国侵略者这种野蛮残暴的行为，不仅不能掩盖住他们的滔天罪行，反而使其罪行更加昭彰。去年夏天，英国政府也曾以同样的原因，对参加国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团的费尔顿夫人进行过迫害，却丝毫不能挫折费尔顿夫人继续向英国人民传达朝鲜真相的意志。费尔顿夫人的勇敢行为，获得了全世界千百万爱好和平人民的热爱和支持。同样，奥地利反动派对布兰德魏纳的迫害，只能使布兰德魏纳揭发美国侵略者罪行的正义行动得到更多的和平人类的支持和拥护；只能增加全世界爱好和平人民对美国侵略者的愤怒和仇恨，而更加坚决地为制止细菌战而进行不懈的斗争。
    中国人民坚决抗议奥地利反动派对布兰德魏纳的迫害。我们以无限的同情寄予英勇的和平战士布兰德魏纳。中国人民决与全世界爱好和平人民在一起，声援奥地利人民的抗议斗争。
