Following the reduction of prices for general merchandise and flour, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government instructed state-owned trading departments in various regions on the 8th of this month to universally reduce paper prices starting from the 18th. The reduction margin for domestically produced newspaper paper is 6 percent, 10 percent for imported newspaper paper, and 10 to 20 percent for other domestically produced and imported miscellaneous paper. This is another important achievement of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and it will play a significant role in promoting the development of the nation's cultural undertakings and improving the people's cultural life.

    全国纸张牌价降低
    中央人民政府贸易部继降低百货、面粉牌价之后，又在本月八日指示各地国营贸易部门，自十八日起普遍降低纸张牌价。国产报纸类降低幅度为百分之六，进口报纸类降低百分之十，其他国产和进口杂纸类降低幅度为百分之十至二十。这是反贪污反盗窃运动又一重要成果，它在推动国家文化事业的发展、人民文化生活的改善上，有很大作用。
