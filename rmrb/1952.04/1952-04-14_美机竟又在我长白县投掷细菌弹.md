Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 13th: The incorrigible American bacteriological warfare criminals, brazenly disregarding the protests and condemnations of the people of the world, have once again dropped bacteriological bombs in Jiazaishui Village, Dawaizi Village, and Gushancun Village in the Fourth District of Changbai County, Liaodong Province, China.

On March 26th, at 9:35 PM, an American aggressor military aircraft sneaked into the airspace of Changbai County, Liaodong Province. At that time, Li Mingcheng, a farmer living in Dawaizi Village, Jiazaishui Village, Fourth District of the county, suddenly heard an explosion while the American plane was circling overhead. After the explosion, he heard a rustling sound. He immediately sent his son, Li Zhengxiang, to report to the village people's government and vigilantly went out to search, but found nothing due to the darkness.

The next morning, all the villagers went out to search. At about 8:00 AM, they discovered half of a broken bacteriological bomb about 180 meters west of Li Mingcheng's house. Subsequently, they found the other half nearby and discovered many leaflets attached with bacteria-carrying insects such as flies, fleas, and beetles near the bomb. On the 28th, the villagers continued their search. At 3:30 PM on the 31st, Jiang Shude and other farmers from Dawaizi Village discovered another bacteriological bomb body on a hillside on the south bank of the Baidao River, about half a li from the village. On April 1st, Jin Xishan, a farmer from Gushancun Village, which is separated from Dawaizi Village by a mountain, discovered the body of a third bacteriological bomb that had been broken into eight pieces while going up the mountain to collect firewood.

This type of bacteriological bomb is identical in shape to those dropped by American planes in Korea. The bomb, except for the silver-white fuse, has a grey-yellow shell and tail. It is 149 centimeters long, with the fuse being 8 centimeters long, the tail being 27.8 centimeters long, the shell being 113.2 centimeters long, and the shell's diameter being 36 centimeters. The inside of the bomb is divided into four compartments. On the silver-white fuze, in addition to many Arabic numerals, there is the distinct American marking "U.S. TIME". The vile, despicable, cunning, and shameless American aggressors, in order to conceal their crimes of conducting heinous bacteriological warfare, inscribed the words "BOMBLEAFLET" ("leaflet bomb") and "500 PBM 105" on the outside of the shell, and the word "EMPTY" on the other side. American bacteriological war criminals vainly attempt to use the so-called "leaflet bomb" and "empty" markings as a cover to try to deny their monstrous crime of using bacteriological bombs. But such rogue tactics of the Wall Street gangsters are useless; the bacteria-carrying insects on the leaflets are the best evidence. The heroic and vigilant Chinese people have once again grasped ironclad evidence of the bloody American aggressors using bacteriological bombs. The bacteriological war criminals will absolutely not escape the righteous punishment of the people of the world!

### 美机竟又在我长白县投掷细菌弹

    美机竟又在我长白县投掷细菌弹
    英勇而机警的我国人民再一次掌握了美国侵略者罪恶的证据
    【新华社安东十三日电】怙恶不悛的美国细菌战犯，竟悍然不顾全世界人民的抗议和斥责，又在我国辽东省长白县四区佳在水村大崴子屯和孤山存屯，投掷细菌炸弹。
    三月二十六日晚九时三十五分，美国侵略者的军用飞机一架，乘黑夜窜入我辽东省长白县上空。当时住在该县四区佳在水村大崴子屯的农民李明成，在美机盘旋该地上空时，突然听到爆炸声，爆炸声之后又听到一阵沙沙的响声，他当即派遣其子李政祥到村人民政府报告，并机警地出外搜查，因天黑未有所获。
    第二天清晨，全村人民出动搜查，八时许，即在李明成的住宅以西约一百八十公尺处，发现了一个已经破裂的细菌炸弹的一半。随后又在附近将另外的一半找到，并在该弹附近发现了许多上面附有苍蝇、跳蚤、甲虫等带菌昆虫的传单。二十八日，该村人民继续出动搜查，至三十一日下午三时半，大崴子屯农民姜树德等，又在距该屯约半里的八道江南岸的一个山坡上，发现了另一个细菌炸弹的弹体。四月一日，与大崴子屯相隔一山的孤山存屯，农民金锡善上山打柴时，又发现了第三个已经破碎成为八块的细菌弹的弹体。
    这种细菌炸弹和美机在朝鲜所投放的形状完全相同。该弹除引信部分为银白色外，弹壳和弹尾翼均为灰黄色。全长一百四十九公分，其中引信长八公分，弹尾翼长二十七点八公分，弹壳长一百一十三点二公分，弹壳直径为三十六公分。炸弹内部分为四格，在银白色的信管上，除许多阿拉伯字外，有着明显的美国标志“U．S．TIME”的字样。卑鄙下流、狡猾无耻的美国侵略者，为掩饰其进行万恶的细菌战的罪行，在弹壳的外面注以“BOMBLEAFLET”（“传单炸弹”）和“五零零PBM    一零五”等字样，另一面则有“EMPTY”
    （“空的”）的字样。美国细菌战犯们妄想用所谓“传单炸弹”和“空的”等字样作为掩护，企图狡赖其使用细菌炸弹的滔天罪行。但华尔街的流氓们这种耍无赖的卑劣手段是无用的，传单上的带菌昆虫就是最好的见证。英勇而机警的中国人民，再一次地掌握了血腥的美国侵略者使用细菌炸弹的铁的证据，细菌战犯们绝对逃脱不了全世界人民的正义的惩罚！
