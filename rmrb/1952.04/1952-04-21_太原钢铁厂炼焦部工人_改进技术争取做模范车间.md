    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Coking Department Workers
    Improve Technology and Strive to Become a Model Workshop
    Editor: The workers of the Coking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have greatly enhanced their class consciousness during this "Three-Anti" campaign, and have made many improvements in production technology. The washing coal section chief and veteran foreman Li Tiankui added a rake to the coal crusher, which solved the problem of the electric roller heating up and the coal crusher getting stuck when it rained. The sedimentation coal group improved the sedimentation tank door, reducing the moisture content of the washed coal. The coke oven workshop improved the blowing device and the kindling operation. These are the main reasons for the continuous increase in production. Now, various groups are enthusiastically launching competitions, and even the previously backward veteran workers Wang Hailiang and Li Tiankui have become activists. Staff and technical personnel are stepping up research, strengthening various systems, and improving equipment to meet the requirements of the workers. This is the new atmosphere of the Coking Department after the "Three-Anti" campaign. All employees are full of confidence to welcome the Red May and strive to become a model workshop.

    太原钢铁厂炼焦部工人
    改进技术争取做模范车间
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂炼焦部工人，在这次“三反”斗争中，大大提高了阶级觉悟，在生产技术上有很多改进。洗煤股股长和老工长李天魁在破煤机上加了扒子，解决了下雨电滚子发热，破煤机被煤黏住的问题。沉淀煤小组改进了沉淀池门，减低了洗煤水分。焦炉工场改进了吹风装置及捎火操作。这是生产量不断提高的主要原因。现在，各小组正热烈展开竞赛，连过去落后的老工人王海亮、李天魁也都成了积极分子。职员和技术人员正加紧研究，加强各种制度，改善设备，以适合工人的要求。这是炼焦部“三反”后的新气象，全体职工正充满信心迎接红五月，争取成为模范车间。
