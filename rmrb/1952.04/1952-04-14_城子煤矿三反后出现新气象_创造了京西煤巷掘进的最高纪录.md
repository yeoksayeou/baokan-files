To the Editor:

After the "Three-Anti" campaign, workers at the Chengzi Coal Mine in the Beijing Western Mining Area created the highest record for coal seam tunneling in Western Beijing. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, due to bureaucracy on the part of the leadership, embezzlers controlled the economic and workers' welfare departments, sucking the blood and sweat of workers for a long time. For example, the "tiger" in the cooperative embezzled figures several times greater than the original capital, and goods were even more expensive than the market price; medical personnel in the clinic discriminated against workers, affecting worker attendance. After the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, the administrative leadership one-sidedly emphasized "tiger" hunting, neglecting safety in production, resulting in continuous work-related injuries, and workers' morale declined. The Party and trade union leaders of the mine saw these deviations and immediately tried to correct them, transferring personnel to lead production, promptly solving safety problems, and systematically promoting Ma Liuhai's rapid tunneling experience. At the same time, they vigorously mobilized workers to encircle and suppress more than a dozen large "tigers." During this period, workers' welfare was also improved. For example, the meals for patients in the sanatorium have been improved, and the newly established labor model sanatorium can also have more than thirty advanced producers go for recuperation every month.

Combining "tiger" hunting and "production," the workers' enthusiasm for production soared, and they automatically put forward the slogan "Go down the well to engage in production, and go up the well to catch tigers," and production competitions were launched between groups. A new atmosphere has thus emerged on the production front. As a result of the workers' efforts, the first quarter production target has been exceeded by 16 percent; Production Team Twelve, which experimented with Ma Liuhai's rapid tunneling method, created the highest record of 21.8 meters of coal seam tunneling in Western Beijing on March 23, while also ensuring safe production.

    城子煤矿三反后出现新气象
    创造了京西煤巷掘进的最高纪录
    编辑同志：北京京西矿区城子煤矿工人，在反贪污斗争中，创京西煤巷掘进最高纪录。“三反”运动以前，由于领导方面的官僚主义，使贪污分子掌握了经济和工人福利部门，长期吸吮着工人血汗。如合作社的“老虎”，贪污的数字大于原资金数倍，物品比市价还贵；卫生所人员歧视工人，影响工人生产出勤率。“三反”运动开始后，行政领导方面片面强调打“虎”，忽视安全生产，致连续发生工伤事故，工人生产情绪低落。该矿党、工会领导干部看到这些偏向，立即想法纠正，抽调专人领导生产，及时解决安全问题，并有计划地推广马六孩快速掘进经验。他们同时大力发动职工，围剿出十多只大“老虎”。在这期间，工人福利也改善了。如疗养所病人的饭菜已得到改进，成立不久的劳动模范休养所，每月也可有三十多位先进生产者去休养了。
    “打虎”和“生产”结合，工人们生产热情高涨，自动提出了“下井搞生产，上井捉老虎”的口号，组与组之间展开生产竞赛。生产战线上因而产生一片新气象。工人们努力的结果，已把第一季生产任务超过百分之十六；试验马六孩快速掘进的生产十二组，在三月二十三日创造煤巷掘进二十一公尺八的京西煤巷最高纪录，还保证了安全生产。
