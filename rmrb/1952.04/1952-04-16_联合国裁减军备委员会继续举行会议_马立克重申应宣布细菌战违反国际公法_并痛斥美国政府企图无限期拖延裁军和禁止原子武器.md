(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th) According to TASS, the UN Disarmament Commission continues to hold meetings.

At the Disarmament Commission meeting on April 2nd, the US and British majority passed the establishment of two working committees. The first working committee would study the vaguely worded issue of "limiting all types of armaments and armed forces," and the second working committee would study the issue of "reporting and reviewing" armament information.

The second working committee held meetings on April 5th and 10th. The US delegation put forward a so-called "proposal for progressively and regularly reporting and reviewing information on armed forces and armaments." Like previous US proposals, this proposal did not mention the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament.

Soviet representative Malik spoke against the US proposal, exposing the US delegation's attempt to engage the Disarmament Commission in unproductive discussions on the collection of armament information, while preventing the adoption of a decision on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Malik pointed out that the US representatives could not even answer how many years it would take, according to the US plan, to pass a resolution on the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament.

Malik said that the basic task of the Disarmament Commission is to draft recommendations for the immediate adoption of important decisions on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments and armed forces. However, the US plan is actually one of the measures to prepare for a new war, because it pursues the goal of collecting all intelligence on other countries' armed forces, armaments, and war industries, while allowing the US atomic weapons and other types of secret weapons of mass destruction to continue to be kept secret, and allowing the US to continue to expand its armaments and manufacture atomic weapons without restrictions.

Malik pointed out that if the US delegation and other delegations that support it truly hope that the UN Disarmament Commission will succeed, they should first agree to adopt an international resolution on a unanimous agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and a substantial reduction of armaments and armed forces. Without such a major resolution, talking about reporting and reviewing armament information is absurd and useless.

The first working committee held meetings on April 5th and 9th. The April 9th meeting discussed the Soviet delegation's proposal to prohibit atomic weapons and reduce armaments and armed forces. Representatives from the US, Britain, France, Canada, and other countries tried to obstruct serious discussion of the Soviet proposal at the meeting. Soviet representative Malik spoke out to expose the attitude of these countries' representatives and firmly demanded the adoption of the Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons and reduce armaments, because only this proposal can realize the noble ideal cherished by the most kind people and all peace-loving countries to completely disarm and eliminate the threat of another world war.

Malik particularly emphasized that the Soviet delegation once again raised the issue of bacteriological weapons and firmly demanded that the UN Disarmament Commission declare bacteriological warfare to be a violation of the basic principles of international law and contrary to the conscience and honor of all peoples.

Malik contrasted the two diametrically opposed attitudes at the meeting: on the one hand, the Soviet Union strives to immediately resolve the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarming, and on the other hand, the United States is trying to delay this issue indefinitely, while obtaining new espionage information about the Soviet army and defense industrial locations by collecting intelligence.

Malik exposed the Western countries' representatives' attempts to delay making decisions on major issues by arguing about details, pointing out that the US representative admitted that the US plan on atomic weapons is not a supervision plan but a possession plan, a plan for the US to possess the atomic enterprises of various countries and establish an international atomic super-trust on a commercial basis. What the Soviet Union insists on is to establish a real international control agency, with the power to conduct regular inspections but without interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Whether to establish a commercial atomic trust dominated by US monopoly capitalists, or to establish an international control agency based on international agreements, based on the principle of equal participation of all sovereign countries, and with appropriate powers to strictly supervise the implementation of the ban on atomic weapons, is a matter of principle, which must be resolved first, and then there is a basis for discussing the details.

Malik said that although the US government talks about prohibiting atomic weapons and reducing armaments, it comes up with various excuses to evade passing this resolution. Initially, it claimed that it was impossible to disarm before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Later, it said that the peace treaty with Germany had not yet been concluded, and then it said that armaments could not be reduced before the UN forces were formed. Now, the United States has forgotten all of this and has come up with a new excuse: armaments cannot be reduced and atomic weapons cannot be prohibited before armament intelligence is presented. Thus, it can be clearly seen that while the US government superficially agrees to discuss disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and discusses this issue indefinitely, on the other hand, it tries its best to prevent disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons with all kinds of excuses. As long as the US government adheres to this approach, no achievements can be made.

    联合国裁减军备委员会继续举行会议
    马立克重申应宣布细菌战违反国际公法
    并痛斥美国政府企图无限期拖延裁军和禁止原子武器
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会继续举行会议。
    在四月二日裁减军备委员会会议上，美英多数通过成立两个工作委员会，第一工作委员会研究含糊其辞的所谓“限制各类军备和武装部队”问题，第二工作委员会研究关于“报告与审查”军备情报问题。
    第二工作委员会在四月五日及十日举行会议。美国代表团提出所谓“逐步和经常地报告并审查武装部队和军备情报的建议”。和美国以前的建议一样，这个建议一个字也没有提到禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题。
    苏联代表马立克发言反对美国这个建议，揭露美国代表团企图使裁减军备委员会在收集军备情报问题上进行毫无裨益的讨论，而阻止通过裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决定。马立克指出：美国代表甚至不能回答，按照美国的计划，要多少年以后才能就禁止原子武器及裁减军备问题通过决议。
    马立克说：裁减军备委员会的基本任务是草拟建议，以便就禁止原子武器以及裁减军备与武装部队问题立即通过重大的决定。但是美国的计划实际上是准备新战争的措施之一，因为它所追随的目标是收集其他国家的武装部队、军备及战争工业的全部情报，而同时却使美国的原子武器及其他类型的大规模毁灭人民的秘密武器能继续保持秘密，并且使美国能够继续无限制扩充军备及制造原子武器。
    马立克指出：美国代表团以及其他支持它的代表团如果真正希望联合国裁减军备委员会得到成功，它们就应该首先同意通过一个关于禁止原子武器与大量裁减军备和武装部队的一致协议的国际决议。没有这样一个主要决议，谈论报告与审查军备情报是荒谬的、无用的。
    第一工作委员会在四月五日及九日举行会议。九日会议讨论苏联代表团所提出的禁止原子武器和裁减军备与武装部队的建议。美、英、法、加拿大等国代表在会上力图阻挠认真讨论苏联的建议。苏联代表马立克发言揭发了这些国家代表的态度，并坚决要求通过苏联所提的禁止原子武器和裁减军备的建议，因为只有这个建议才能实现最善良的人们和一切爱好和平的国家所怀抱的彻底裁减军备和消除另一次世界大战的威胁的高尚理想。
    马立克特别强调说：苏联代表团再度提出细菌武器问题，并坚决要求：联合国裁减军备委员会宣布细菌战是违反国际法的基本原则的，而且是与各国人民的良心和荣誉相违背的。
    马立克对比了会上两种截然相反的态度，一方面是苏联力求立即解决禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题，另一方面是美国竭力要把这个问题无限期地拖延，同时通过收集情报取得关于苏联军队和国防工业地点的新谍报。
    马立克揭露西方国家代表力图以关于细节问题的争辩拖延就主要问题作出决定指出：美国代表承认，美国关于原子武器的计划不是一个监督计划而是一个占有计划，是由美国占有各国原子企业，在商业性的基础上建立一个国际原子超级托辣斯的计划。而苏联所坚持主张的是建立一个真正的国际管制机构，赋有进行经常的视察的权力但不得干涉各国的内政。究竟是成立一个由美国垄断资本家主宰的商业性的原子托辣斯，还是成立一个以国际协定为基础、以一切自主国家平等参加的原则为基础、并有适当的权力能够严格监督原子武器禁令的执行的国际管制机构，这是一个原则问题，必须首先解决，然后才有讨论细节的基础。
    马立克说：美国政府虽然谈论禁止原子武器及裁减军备，但却想出各种藉口来规避通过这一决议。最初，它声称：在缔结对日和约以前不可能裁减军备。后来，它说：还没有缔结对德和约，以后又说：在联合国军队组成以前不能裁减军备。现在，美国忘记了所有这一切，又提出了新的藉口：在关于军备情报提出以前，军备不能裁减，原子武器不能禁止。这样，可以十分明显地看出：美国政府一方面表面上同意讨论裁减军备和禁止原子武器，并且无限期地就此问题进行讨论，另一方面却想尽各种藉口阻止裁减军备和禁止原子武器。只要美国政府坚持这种方针，就不能获致任何成就。
