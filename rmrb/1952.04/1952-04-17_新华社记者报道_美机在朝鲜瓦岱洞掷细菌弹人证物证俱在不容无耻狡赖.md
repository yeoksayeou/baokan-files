American Planes Dropped Bacteriological Bombs in Wataedong, Korea - Material and Human Evidence Exists, No Shameless Denial Allowed
[Xinhua News Agency, 16th] This reporter, accompanying the "Investigation Group on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Bacteriological Warfare," reports on the detailed investigation of the bombing of Wataedong, Xingting Village, Tushan Township, Jincheon County by American imperialist aircraft:

On the morning of March 14th, at 11:10 AM, five American fighter planes flew towards Wataedong from the southeast. Without circling, they dropped a total of thirty-two bombs, one of which made a small explosion sound. According to the testimony of Zhao Zhao, deputy leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers who witnessed the event: When the enemy planes dived to drop bombs the first and second times, I was still hiding in a local villager's house. When the enemy planes dived the third time, I was leaving the villager's house and heading towards an air-raid shelter. At that moment, I saw a bomb land in a rice paddy about 100 meters south of Wataedong. The explosion of this bomb was not loud and produced black smoke. About fifteen minutes later, the enemy planes left. I found several pieces of light metal (the skin of a general bomb is steel) fragments near the bomb crater. The edges of these fragments were blue and yellow. In the bomb crater and around it, I found various insects such as flies, mosquitoes, and spiders. These insects were not active when I first saw them, but gradually became active after about thirty minutes. Their density was about twenty or more per square meter, and insects were found within fifty meters around the crater. In other places, it was difficult to find insects at that time.

On March 28th, while interviewing Zhao Zhao, this reporter, accompanied by him, Min Yuanshi, the secretary of the Wataedong branch of the Korean Workers' Party (equivalent to the village branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party), Li Fushun, the chairman of the Women's League, Cai Xiangyu, a 64-year-old farmer, and Xu Yanxie, a 65-year-old female farmer, inspected the bomb crater. The crater was located at the corner of a rice paddy next to the village, two meters in diameter and eighty centimeters deep. Many of the germ-carrying insects dropped by the enemy planes fourteen days ago have been preserved as specimens by the Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers and Korean farmers. The reporter personally saw the light metal fragments of the bacteriological bomb still in the crater, as well as various insects that were still lively and crawling, which had been captured in the crater and its surroundings and placed in bottles.

Holding a bottle containing insects in one hand and pointing to the crater with the other, Min Yuanshi testified: Not only did these insects appear earlier than the season, but they also differ in many ways from the local insects in Korea. This alone is ironclad proof that the American devils are conducting bacteriological warfare.

They said: The flies dropped by the enemy planes came in two sizes. The large flies were about the size of a soybean, with hair on their bodies and black in color, and their wings were longer than their bodies. The small flies had small heads, slender bodies, and wings longer than their bodies, and were black. Although there are also two common types of flies in Korea: one is grass green and the other is gray with red spots, their bodies are not so slender, and their wings are the same length as their bodies.

The spiders dropped by the enemy planes also came in two sizes: the large ones were about the size of a soybean, with round bellies and white spots on their backs, and were blackish-yellow; the small ones were about half the size of a grain of rice, with slightly longer bellies and slightly shiny backs, and were blackish-yellow. However, the spiders that can be seen in Korea do not have white spots on their backs and are black.

The mosquitoes dropped by the enemy planes had slender bodies, short legs, and large wings. The local mosquitoes in Korea are yellow with long mouths and small wings.

During their testimony, they denounced the despicable and shameless behavior of the American aggressors, who were both thieves and liars, with uncontrollable anger. Cai Xiangyu, a 64-year-old Korean farmer, said: It is absolutely true that the American devils are conducting bacteriological warfare. No matter how they deny it, we, together with the people of the world, will definitely bring the heinous bacteriological war criminals to justice.

The photographers and filmmakers who went to investigate with the reporter photographed the crater and the scenes of the Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers and Korean farmers giving testimony.

    美机在朝鲜瓦岱洞掷细菌弹人证物证俱在不容无耻狡赖
    【新华社十六日讯】本社随“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”记者报道实地调查美帝国主义飞机在金川郡兔山面杏亭里瓦岱洞投掷细菌弹的详细经过称：
    三月十四日上午十一时十分，美国战斗机五架自东南向瓦岱洞上空飞来，未经盘旋就先后投弹达三十二枚，其中有一枚爆炸声微小。据目击者志愿军某部副组长赵照作证说：敌机第一、第二次俯冲投弹时，我还在老乡家里隐蔽，敌机第三次俯冲时，我正离开老乡的房子向防空洞走去，就在这时，我看见一枚炸弹落在瓦岱洞南一百多公尺的稻田里。这个炸弹爆炸时声音不大，冒黑烟。约十五分钟后，敌机离去。我在弹坑附近发现几块轻金属（一般炸弹皮是钢质的）的炸弹碎片，这些碎片的锋刃上呈蓝、黄色，在弹坑里和它的四周我发现蝇、蚊、蜘蛛等多种昆虫。这些虫子在我看到时还不活跃，过了三十分钟以后，才渐渐活跃。它的密度约为一平方公尺二十多个，在弹坑周围的五十公尺内都有昆虫发现，在其他的地方，当时就很难找到昆虫。
    三月二十八日，记者在访问赵照的同时，还由他及朝鲜劳动党瓦岱洞的分细胞委员长（相当于我国共产党的村支部书记）闵元植、女性同盟委员长李福顺、六十四岁的农民蔡相玉、六十五岁的女农民许岩协等带同察看了弹坑。弹坑位于村旁一块稻田的拐角上，直径二公尺，深八十公分。十四天前敌机投下的带菌昆虫，很多被志愿军战士及朝鲜农民当做标本保存着。记者亲眼看见仍在弹坑里的轻金属细菌弹的碎片，以及在这个弹坑和它的周围捉住装在瓶子里的仍然活泼爬动的多种昆虫。
    闵元植一手拿着装昆虫的瓶子，一手指着弹坑作证说：这些昆虫不仅出现的季节过早，而且和我们朝鲜当地的昆虫也有许多不同之处，仅此一点，也就是美国鬼子进行细菌战的铁证。
    他们说：敌机投下的苍蝇有大小两种，大苍蝇相当于一粒黄豆大，身上长毛，发黑，翅膀比身子长；小苍蝇头小，身细长，翅膀比身子长，黑色。朝鲜当地常见的苍蝇虽也有两种：一种是草绿色，一种灰色有红斑点，可是身体不是那样细，翅膀与身体一样长。
    敌机投下的蜘蛛也有大小两种：大的约一粒黄豆大，肚子圆，背上有白斑点，黑黄色；小的约半粒稻子大，肚子稍为长，背部有点发亮，黑黄色。但在朝鲜能够看到的蜘蛛，背上均没有白斑点，并且是黑色。
    敌机投下的蚊子身细长，腿短，翅膀大；朝鲜当地的蚊子身黄色，嘴长，翅膀小。
    他们在作证时，都以不能抑止的愤怒心情，斥责美国侵略者又作贼又狡赖的卑鄙无耻行为。六十四岁的朝鲜农民蔡相玉说：美国鬼子进行细菌战是千真万确的，不管它怎样抵赖，我们和全世界人民一道，一定要把万恶的细菌战犯们归案法办。
    和记者一道去调查的摄影记者和电影工作者们，当时拍下了这一弹坑，也拍下了志愿军战士和朝鲜农民作证时的情景。
