He said: The brilliant victory of the Romanian working class and the people of the whole country on the road to socialist construction is not only a victory for the Romanian people, but is also related to the victory of the Korean people's war against aggression. He said: The broad masses of workers in Korea are now launching a production increase campaign to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

In Romania, permanent institutions for assisting Korea have been established, and work to support Korea is being carried out extensively. Now, while the Romanian people are strongly denouncing the American imperialists' crimes of aggression, we are sending 188 train cars of gifts including grain, clothing, and medicine to the Korean people.
