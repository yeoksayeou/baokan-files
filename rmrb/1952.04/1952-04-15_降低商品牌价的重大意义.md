Recently, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives across the country have successively lowered the listed retail prices of a large number of commodities. These commodities are mainly daily necessities. Shanghai has lowered the prices of more than 10,000 commodities, and Beijing has lowered the prices of nearly 4,000 commodities. The prices of some commodities in other cities have either been lowered or will be lowered soon. The extent of these commodity price reductions ranges from about 2% to about 40%, with an average of about 8%. This is one of the important and direct gains of the nationwide anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. The broad masses of the people have begun to enjoy the fruits of victory of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. This has further made people realize the great significance of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement; and realize that strengthening and consolidating the leadership of the working class is a guarantee for improving the people's living welfare.

This reduction in commodity prices has obviously enabled the broad masses of people, especially wage-earning laborers and farmers, to directly enjoy a considerable degree of real material welfare. For example, with the price index of last December as 100, the price index in early April this year dropped to about 95%, a decrease of 5%. Among them, grain prices remained stable, and the prices of daily necessities fell by about 8%. That is to say, although the monetary wages of wage-earning laborers and the monetary income of farmers have not changed, their real wages and real income have increased by about 5%. The purchasing power of the people has generally increased, and the entire national economic life will inevitably become more active. This will have a great effect on developing production and promoting economic prosperity.

Thanks to the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, state-owned trading agencies and cooperative agencies have undergone strict rectification, which has reduced the production costs of state-owned factories and also reduced the ex-factory prices of commodities in private enterprises, thus creating conditions for lowering the prices of many commodities.

The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has purified the ranks of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives, and greatly improved the political awareness and professional level of the staff in these departments. This is an important reason why commodity prices can be reduced. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, many "insiders" and agents of illegal bourgeoisie sneaked into state-owned trading departments and cooperatives, and some of the most heinous elements even usurped the leadership of certain state-owned economic departments. They stole and sold price information, commodity inventory information, and procurement and sales plans of state-owned economy. When accepting goods, they colluded with illegal bourgeoisie, using old as new, bad as good, fake as genuine, and counting less as more, causing serious damage to state property and the interests of the people. These "insiders" and agents of the illegal bourgeoisie have been eliminated in large numbers in the "Three-Anti" movement, and many blood-sucking vessels of the illegal bourgeoisie inserted into the national economy have been cut off by the people. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, some staff members of certain state-owned trading institutions and cooperatives had serious bureaucratic styles. They were not familiar with the business, nor did they study hard; they did not understand the cost and specifications of the products of private factories, nor did they conduct investigations and research; they lacked a sense of political responsibility and worked in a rough and careless manner. Therefore, when they placed processing orders with capitalists, they were often deceived by illegal capitalists and bought inferior goods at high prices. Most of this loss was borne by consumers. In the "Three-Anti" movement, these staff members improved their political awareness and professional level. They began to rely on workers and staff in private factories and shops to calculate the production costs of various commodities more accurately, signed more reasonable processing order contracts with capitalists, and implemented more serious counting and inspection of goods, which greatly reduced the possibility of illegal capitalists falsely reporting costs and cutting corners, and directly promoted the reduction of commodity prices.

In the great anti-theft movement, illegal capitalists truly saw the strength of the working class, realized that it was impossible to continue implementing the "five poisons," and many of them expressed their willingness to obey the leadership of the working class and the national economy, and seek legitimate profits through legitimate channels, thus greatly reducing the five poisons of the bourgeoisie. This is another important reason why commodity prices can be reduced. The reason why state-owned trading departments can reduce commodity prices is obviously because their purchase prices have been reduced. The reason why purchase prices can be reduced is because the ex-factory prices of many commodities have been reduced. Before the anti-theft movement, many private industrialists and businessmen devoted their main energy to bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic information, instead of paying attention to improving the operation and management of factories. In this way, they not only harmed the interests of the state and the people, but also harmed the production business they operated. After the anti-theft movement, their "five poisons" of attacking the state and the people have suffered a fatal blow; they saw that their correct way out was only to improve the operation and management of factories under the leadership of the state-owned economy, so as to seek reasonable profits from legitimate operations. The workers in private factories, in the anti-theft movement, have unprecedentedly improved their political enthusiasm and the consciousness of being masters of their own affairs. They have played the active role of the leading class, accurately planned the quantity of raw material consumption, the ratio of machine depreciation, the quota of man-hour consumption, and various expenses in the production and sales process, assisted the staff of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives, and signed reasonable processing order contracts with capitalists, and in the production process, supervised the capitalists to earnestly fulfill these contracts. This greatly promoted the reduction of commodity prices.

After the commodity prices are lowered, the staff of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives should work harder to improve their operation and management. In order to consolidate the results of lowering commodity prices, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives must change the past phenomenon of "not knowing what's in their minds" and letting things go in entrusted processing, ordering, and purchasing and sales business, and replace it with a meticulous and responsible style, so that the level of business can be gradually improved. Similarly, after the commodity prices are lowered, law-abiding industrialists and businessmen and those who have made mistakes but have confessed and repented must also put their energy into improving business operations.

Reasonably lowering commodity prices is not only harmless but also beneficial to the production of private industry, which is obvious. The People's Government has resolutely implemented the correct policy of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity in the past and now, while illegal capitalists have肆无忌惮地破坏了 人民政府 的 政策. They pursued high illegal profits and did not operate their production business through legitimate channels. Now state-owned trading departments have appropriately reduced the commodity prices and ex-factory prices based on accurate calculations, while still allowing capitalists to obtain reasonable profits. As long as they operate well, the production of private industry can be fully developed. Under the current conditions, state-owned trading departments have also taken care of various different situations when lowering commodity prices. For example, the extent of commodity price reductions in inland cities is lower than that in coastal cities. This is because the technical equipment of inland factories is relatively old, and it is perfectly reasonable for state-owned trading departments to make their ex-factory prices slightly higher than those in coastal cities. For example, some private knitting factories often falsely reported the amount of material consumption when processing for state-owned enterprises in the past; now, after checking and calculating, state-owned trading departments have decided to reduce the amount of material consumption falsely reported by private manufacturers, but at the same time appropriately increase the labor processing fees. The profit of Tianjin canvas processing used to be 15% of the processing fee, but now it has been increased to 20%. These facts most powerfully illustrate that on the one hand, the People's Government must resolutely eliminate the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists, and on the other hand, it must resolutely take care of the reasonable profits of private industrialists and businessmen.

The current achievements in lowering commodity prices are only preliminary. In order to consolidate the existing achievements, we still have to make great efforts. The reason why the ex-factory prices of private industrial products can be reduced now is only the result of eliminating the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists and appropriately reducing the illegal profits of the remaining capitalists. In the future, as long as private industrial capitalists continue to improve their operation and management, and the vast number of workers in private factories continue to promote the supervisory role and labor enthusiasm of being masters of their own affairs, then the production costs of private industry will be reduced, and private industry will have greater development. The "Three-Anti" movement of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives has not yet been fully completed, and various construction works have just begun. State-owned trading departments and cooperatives should seriously adjust their institutions, establish and improve various systems, reduce operating and management expenses and commodity circulation expenses, and vigorously carry out sales work and accelerate the capital turnover rate in the later stage of the "Three-Anti" movement. If these tasks are done well, it will definitely be possible to continue to reduce the prices of more commodities, make the living welfare of the broad masses of people more guaranteed, and make the social economy of our country more prosperous.

### 降低商品牌价的重大意义

    降低商品牌价的重大意义
    最近全国各地国营贸易部门和合作社陆续降低了大批商品零售的牌价。这些商品主要的是日用百货。上海有一万多种商品降低了牌价，北京有近四千种商品降低了牌价；其他城市若干商品的牌价，有的已经降低，有的即将降低。这些商品牌价降低的幅度，由百分之二到百分之四十左右，平均约在百分之八左右。这是全国人民反贪污、反盗窃运动的重要的直接的收获之一。广大人民开始享受了反贪污、反盗窃运动的胜利果实。这就使人们进一步认识了反贪污、反盗窃运动的伟大意义；认识了工人阶级的领导权的加强和巩固，就是增进人民的生活福利的保证。
    这次降低商品牌价，显然使广大人民，特别是工薪劳动者和农民，直接享受了相当程度的现实的物质福利。如以去年十二月的物价指数为一百，今年四月上旬的物价指数则降至百分之九十五左右，即下降了百分之五。其中粮食价格平稳，日用百货价格下降约百分之八。这就是说，工薪劳动者的货币工资和农民的货币收入虽然没有改变，但他们的实际工资和实际收入，却增加了百分之五左右。人民的购买力普遍地提高了，今后整个国民经济生活必然随之更加活跃。这对于发展生产、繁荣经济是有很大作用的。
    由于伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，使国营贸易机关和合作社机关进行了严格的整理，使国营工厂生产的成本降低，同时也使私营企业中商品的出厂价格降低，这就造成了许多商品牌价降低的条件。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，纯洁了国营贸易部门和合作社的队伍，大大地提高了这些部门的工作人员的政治觉悟和业务水平。这是商品牌价得以降低的一个重要原因。在“三反”运动以前，许多不法资产阶级的“坐探”和代理人钻入国营贸易部门和合作社中，其中一部分罪大恶极的分子，甚至篡夺了某些国营经济部门的领导权。他们盗窃和出卖国营经济的物价情报、商品库存情报和采购销售计划，他们在验收货物时，和不法资产阶级相勾结，以旧为新，以坏顶好，以假充真，以少算多，使国家财产和人民利益遭受了严重的损失。这些不法资产阶级的“坐探”和代理人，已经在“三反”运动中被大批地清除了，不法资产阶级插入国家经济中的许多吸血管，已经被人民斩断了。“三反”运动以前，某些国营贸易机构和合作社的工作人员，有严重的官僚主义作风。他们不熟悉业务，又不认真学习；他们不了解私营工厂的产品的成本和规格，又不进行调查研究；他们缺乏政治责任心，以一种粗枝大叶、马马虎虎的态度进行工作。因此，他们向资本家进行加工定货等业务时，常常被违法资本家所欺骗，而用高价买进劣货。这种损失，大部分是由消费者负担起来的。在“三反”运动中，这些工作人员提高了政治觉悟和业务水平，他们开始依靠私营工厂、商店中的工人和职员，比较确实地核算了各种商品的生产成本，和资本家签订了比较合理的加工定货合同，并且实行了比较认真的点货和验货，这就把违法资本家虚报成本、偷工减料的可能性大大地减少了，直接推动了商品牌价的降低。
    在伟大的反盗窃运动中，违法资本家真正看见了工人阶级的力量，认识了继续施行“五毒”已不可能，其中许多人表示愿意服从工人阶级和国家经济的领导，按照正当的途径，求得合法的利润，因而使资产阶级的五毒大大减少。这是商品牌价得以降低的另一个重要原因。国营贸易部门所以能够降低商品的牌价，显然是因为它的进货价格降低了。进货价格所以能够降低，是因为许多商品出厂的价格降低了。在反盗窃运动以前，许多私营工商业者把主要的精力用于行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报，而不注意改进工厂的经营和管理。这样，他们不仅损害了国家和人民的利益，而且损害了自己经营的生产事业。经过反盗窃运动，他们向国家和人民进攻的“五毒”已经遭受了致命的打击；他们看到了自己正当的出路只有在国营经济的领导下，改善工厂的经营和管理，以便从正当的经营中求得合理的利润。私营工厂中的工人，在反盗窃运动中，更空前地提高了自己的政治积极性和主人翁的自觉，他们发挥了领导阶级的积极作用，精确地计划原材料消耗的数量、机器折旧的比数、工时消耗的定额和生产及推销过程中的各种费用，协助国营贸易部门和合作社的工作人员，和资本家签订合理的加工定货合同，并且在生产过程中，监督资本家切实履行着这些合同。这就大大地推动了商品牌价的降低。
    在商品牌价降低之后，国营贸易部门和合作社的工作人员，更要努力改进自己的经营和管理工作。为了巩固降低商品牌价的成果，国营贸易部门和合作社在委托加工、定货和收购、经销业务中，必须改变过去那种“心中无数”和放任自流的现象，而代之以精打细算、认真负责的作风，这就使得业务水平得以逐步提高。同样，在商品牌价降低之后，守法的和虽有错误但已坦白悔过的工商业者，也必须把自己的精力，用到改善业务经营方面来。
    合理地降低商品牌价，对于私营工业的生产不但无害，而且有利，这是显而易见的。人民政府过去和现在都是坚决地执行着公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济的正确政策，而违法资本家却肆无忌惮地破坏了人民政府的政策。他们追逐高额的非法利润，不按照正当的途径去经营自己的生产事业。现在国营贸易部门根据确实的计算，适当地降低了商品的牌价和出厂的价格，而又使资本家仍然可以获得合理的利润。只要善自经营，私营工业生产完全是可以发展的。在目前条件下，国营贸易部门在降低商品牌价的时候，还照顾了各种不同的情况。例如，内地城市的商品牌价降低的幅度，低于沿海城市的商品牌价降低的幅度。这是因为内地工厂的技术设备较为陈旧，国营贸易部门使其出厂价格略高于沿海城市，这是完全合理的。又如，有些私营针织厂过去给国营企业加工时，常常虚报材料消耗数额；现在国营贸易部门经过核对、计算以后，决定减发私    营厂商虚报的材料消耗额，但同时适当地提高工缴费。天津帆布加工利润，过去为加工费的百分之十五，现在已经提高到百分之二十。这些事实，最有力地说明了人民政府一方面对于违法资本家的“五毒”要坚决予以肃清，另一方面对于私营工商业的合理利润，也要坚决予以照顾。
    目前降低商品牌价的成绩还只是初步的。为了巩固现有的成果，我们仍然必须进行巨大的努力。现在私营工业产品的出厂价格所以能够降低，还只是由于肃清了违法资本家的“五毒”和适当地减低了其余资本家的非法利润的结果。今后，私营工业资本家只要继续改善他们的经营和管理，私营工厂中的广大工人只要继续发扬主人翁的监督作用和劳动热忱，那末，私营工业的生产成本还会降低，私营工业还会有更大的发展。现在国营贸易部门和合作社的“三反”运动也还没有全部结束，各种建设工作刚刚开始。国营贸易部门和合作社应该在“三反”运动的后期，认真地调整机构，建立和健全各种制度，减低经营管理费用和商品流转费用，大力进行推销工作，加速资金周转率。作好了这些工作就一定能够使更多的商品价格继续降低，使广大人民的生活福利更有保证，使我国的社会经济更加繁荣。
