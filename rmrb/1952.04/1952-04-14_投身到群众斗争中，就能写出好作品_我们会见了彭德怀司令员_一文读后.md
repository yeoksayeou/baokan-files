    Throwing Oneself into the Mass Struggle is the Key to Writing Good Works
    – After Reading “We Met Commander Peng Dehuai”
    
    Comrade Editor: After reading Mr. Ba Jin's "We Met Commander Peng Dehuai," published in the People's Daily on April 9th, I was deeply moved. This is the first time I have seen a work that positively portrays the image of the leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Many of the concise and detailed descriptions are worth learning from for literary and journalistic workers. Mr. Ba Jin wrote such a powerful work after participating in the actual struggle on the front lines of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. This fact proves that literary and art workers can only write good works if they practice Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, resolutely throw themselves into the mass struggle, transform themselves, and improve themselves.

    投身到群众斗争中，就能写出好作品
    ——“我们会见了彭德怀司令员”一文读后
    编辑同志：我读了四月九日人民日报登载的巴金先生的“我们会见了彭德怀司令员”一文以后，受到很大的感动。像这样正面表现人民志愿军领袖形象的作品，我还是第一次看到。其中很多简练、细致的描写，是很值得文学、新闻工作者学习的。巴金先生参加了抗美援朝前线实际斗争之后，就写出这样有力的作品。这一事实证明了：文学艺术工作者只有实践毛主席的文艺方针，坚决地投身到群众斗争中去，改造自己，提高自己，才可能写出好的作品。　魏铭
