    Constantly Improving Oneself to Better Help Others
    Petroleum Industry Labor Model Guo Menghe
    Developing China's petroleum industry is a major undertaking. The more China's industry develops, the more it needs to produce more high-quality petroleum. The plans for oil extraction are getting bigger year by year, and our tasks are becoming heavier day by day. To say nothing else, our oil mine drilling team's tasks for the second and third quarters are double that of the first half of the year!
    To complete such a large task at hand, and to take into account the future development needs of the petroleum industry, we must cultivate a large number of skilled workers. Recently, the drilling team of our mine is carrying out a campaign to sign master-apprentice contracts. When I left our oil mine to come to Beijing, more than ten groups out of the team's twenty-odd groups had already signed contracts. Both masters and apprentices expressed that they will teach and learn well in the future, achieving "respect for the teacher and love for the apprentice," and improving skills and culture.
    I have been engaged in drilling work for more than ten years, and I have the responsibility to teach my apprentices well. I will carefully and patiently teach my skills to these young people. In the past, when I taught apprentices, whenever I saw that they did not know a certain technique, I would personally demonstrate it to them and explain why it should be done this way. As a result, many apprentices were very willing to learn from me, and they would actively come to me with any difficulties and problems.
    As a master, one must also set an example for the apprentices in everything. I remember very clearly: the winter before last, I led a group of workers to install machine parts. At that time, the snow was several feet thick, and the wind was as sharp as a knife. Although we were wearing old sheepskin coats, boots more than a foot high, and leather hats, the wind still blew in, and our ears and feet were frozen stiff. Many workers in the team could barely hold on. At that time, in addition to encouraging them, I also tried to find ways to keep them warm. The workers in the team were very moved, and they said, "Seeing Master Guo working like this, we naturally have to work harder." "Master Guo is truly our role model." Later, not only did we complete the task, but we also improved everyone's skills.
    We must constantly study technology and continue to improve ourselves; becoming complacent is very dangerous. We must learn from technicians, engineers, and experts, and also learn from the young workers under our leadership. Only by constantly improving ourselves can we better help others.
    This time, we are going to Romania to participate in the celebration of the "May Day" International Labor Day. We must learn from the advanced experience of Romanian workers so that we can make more contributions to China's petroleum industry in the future.

    不断提高自己，才能更好地帮助别人
    石油工业劳动模范  郭孟和
    发展中国的石油工业，是一件大事。中国工业越发展，越需要生产更多品质优良的石油。开采石油的计划一年比一年大，我们的任务也一天比一天重。不说别的，光我们油矿钻探队来说，第二、三季的任务就比上半年大一倍哩！
    要完成眼前这么大的任务，并照顾到石油工业将来发展的需要，就要培养大量的技术工人。最近，我们矿的钻探队职工，正在开展订立师徒合同运动。当我离开我们的油矿到北京来的时候，全队二十多小组，已有十多个小组订了合同。师傅和徒弟都表示今后要好好教学，做到“尊师爱徒”，提高技术和文化。
    我干了十几年钻探工作，有把徒弟教好的责任。我要细心、耐心地把自己的技术教给这伙年轻人。我过去教徒弟，每见他们不会某种技术，就亲自做给他们看，并说明为什么要这样做。许多徒弟因此很愿意跟我学，遇到什么困难和问题，也主动来找我了。
    做师傅的，还要处处做徒弟的榜样。我记得很清楚：前年冬天，我带了一班职工负责安装机件。那时，雪有几尺厚，风像刀子一样尖，虽然穿着老羊皮大衣，一尺多高的长筒靴，戴着皮帽子，风还往里钻，耳朵和脚都冻僵了。班里很多职工几乎支持不下去了。当时，我除了鼓励他们，还想办法给他们取暖。班里的职工都很感动，他们说：“看郭师傅这样干，我们自然也要加油干。”“郭师傅真是我们的榜样。”后来，不但完成了任务，也提高了大家的技术。
    我们要经常钻研技术，继续提高自己；对自己满足起来是很危险的。我们要向技术人员、工程师和专家们学，也要向在我们领导下的青年工人学。只有不断提高自己，才能更好地帮助别人。
    这次，我们到罗马尼亚参加庆祝“五一”国际劳动节典礼，一定要很好地学习罗马尼亚职工的先进经验，以便今后对我国的石油工业能有更多的贡献。
