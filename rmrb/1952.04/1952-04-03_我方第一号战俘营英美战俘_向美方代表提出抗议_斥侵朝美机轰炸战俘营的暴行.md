Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: "Tonight's News" reporter, Beique Di, reported from Kaesong on March 31st: British and American prisoners of war in the No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp, which was attacked by American aircraft on the morning of March 16th, have protested to the United Nations Command delegation. The British POW Committee, composed of nine POWs representing 219 British POWs, and the American POW Committee, composed of twenty POWs representing 186 American POWs, signed the protest letters separately. The protest letter was forwarded by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Workers' Daily," and was titled "To the United Nations Command Representatives via Free Press Reporters." Along with the protest letter was a .50 caliber bullet, which wounded British Marine Brown (W.E. Brown, service number CHX2867). The full text of the British POWs' protest letter is as follows: "Sir, we would like to return the bullet that you so generously gave to the people in this POW camp. The Chinese People's Volunteers let us sleep soundly, and we would be very grateful if you would cooperate with them in this regard. We think the superb skills of the aircraft pilot and his shooter who took this action are admirable, because the only loss we suffered was a minor back injury to one person. We would be very grateful if you would not let this incident happen again. Signed on behalf of 219 British POWs in Prisoner of War Camp No. 1, North Korea. Note: All of the signatures above are of British prisoners."

The names of the POWs who signed this statement are as follows: Sergeant Manley (L.A. Manley), Smith (W.H. Smith), Green (J.T. Green), Bilboe (W. Bilboe), Corporal Donald Lucas, Soldier Davies (T.H. Davies), Correy (E.A. Correy), Ronald B. Allnm, Eagles (A.P. Eagles).

These individuals, who signed above, stated to reporters through Winnington: "The United Nations Command knows the exact location of this POW camp, as proven by the letters we have received from home. The POW camp is clearly marked. The moon was bright on the night of March 16th, and the visibility was excellent." The statement said that three houses where British POWs lived were hit, and many POWs were spared death. The statement concluded: "We believe this incident is completely unjust and completely disregards our safety."

    我方第一号战俘营英美战俘
    向美方代表提出抗议
    斥侵朝美机轰炸战俘营的暴行
    【新华社二日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌三月三十一日自开城报道：在三月十六日清晨遭受美国飞机袭击的第一号战俘营里的英美战俘，已向联合国军代表团提出抗议。代表二百一十九名英国战俘的由九名战俘组成的英国战俘委员会，和代表一百八十六名美国战俘的由二十名战俘组成的美国战俘委员会，分别在抗议书上签字。抗议书是由英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿转交的，题目是“通过自由报纸记者致联合国军代表”。和抗议书一道送去的是一颗五○口径的枪弹，这颗枪弹曾打伤英国海军陆战队人员布朗（W．E．Brown军人号码CHX2867）。英国战俘的抗议书全文如下： “先生，我们希望把你们非常慷慨地送给本俘虏营的人的子弹送还你们。中国志愿军让我们安安稳稳地睡觉，如果你们愿意在这方面和他们合作的话，我们真是感激不尽。我们认为采取这种行动的飞机驾驶员和他的射击手的高明技术是值得称赞的，因为我们所遭受的唯一损失是有一个人背上受了一点轻伤。如果你们不让这种事件重复发生，我们非常感激。代表朝鲜北部第一号战俘营的二百一十九名英国战俘签名。注意：在上面签名的都是英国俘虏。”
    在这个声明上签名的战俘的姓名如下：中士曼莱（L．A．Manley）、斯密斯（W．H．Smith） 、葛林（J．T．Green ）、比尔波（W．Bilboe）、下士唐纳德·卢加斯（Donald Lucas）、士兵戴维斯（T．H．Davies）、考莱（E．A．Correy）、伦纳德·B·阿伦（RonaldB．Allnm）、易格尔（A．P．Eagles）。
    在上面签名的这些人并通过魏宁顿向记者发表声明说：“本战俘营的确切位置联合国军是知道的，我们接到的家信已证明这一点。战俘营有清晰的标志。三月十六日夜晚月色很好，能见度极好。”声明说，英国战俘住的三所房子曾被击中，许多战俘幸免一死。声明末了说：“我们认为这个事件是完全非正义的，是完全不顾我们的安全的行为。”
