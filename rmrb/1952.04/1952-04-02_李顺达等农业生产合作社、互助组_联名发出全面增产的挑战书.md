The agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams led by nationally renowned agricultural production labor models, including Li Shunda and Geng Changsuo in North China, Han En and Jin Shilong in Northeast China, Lü Hongbin and Li Tianying (female) in East China, Su Dianxuan in Central and Southern China, and Pu Zhongzhi in Northwest China, have jointly issued a letter of challenge to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers nationwide, aiming to universally increase the unit area yield of farmland and complete this year's production increase task. The following is the full text of their letter of challenge:

"In response to the call of the Central People's Government, in order to launch a national agricultural patriotic production increase campaign on an even larger scale than last year, we hereby jointly challenge agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmer brothers across the country. We guarantee to: We will become models of organized cooperative production, improve various systems within the cooperative (team), strengthen democratic life, implement reasonable division of labor, exert higher labor efficiency, and rationally use land, in order to achieve a comprehensive increase in the unit area yield and overall production increase of the land we cultivate this year; we welcome farmers from all over the country to accept the challenge and compete. We request the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and local people's governments at all levels to act as supervisors and judges of the competition. The following are our conditions:

	One, the average yield per mu of all the cooperative's (team's) irrigated and dry farmland must increase by at least 10% compared to last year. The cooperative's (team's) production level this year should be higher than the average level of the village (or township) where it is located.

	Two, the entire cooperative (team) will use a portion of farmland (three mu or more) as high-yield land to create high-yield records for one or more major crops, becoming the highest unit area yield of that crop in the village (or township) where it is located.

	Three, we will appropriately develop forestry, animal husbandry, and rural sideline occupations based on local conditions, comprehensively develop the agricultural economy, and improve rural productivity.

	Four, we will become models for responding to the call of the People's Government, constantly studying and improving farming techniques: taking the lead in using new farm tools and practicing deep plowing and careful cultivation; building farmland water conservancy projects to achieve rational irrigation and timely drainage; rationally and effectively increasing the application of fertilizers to improve soil quality; the crops sown by the entire cooperative (team) this year should be selected from high-yielding, disaster-resistant, high-quality varieties suitable for the local area, and seed soaking and seed mixing should be implemented to prevent and control diseases and insect pests; and preparations should be made for drought and flood prevention to ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan in the event of drought, flood, and other disasters.

	Five, we will accumulate collective property and enhance the investment power for expanded reproduction. To this end, we will establish contact with local supply and marketing cooperatives and sign supply and marketing contracts.

	Six, we will become patriotic models: strengthening the study of current affairs, politics, and culture; and ensuring the active payment of patriotic grain and the timely sale of cotton and other industrial raw materials to the state to meet the needs of national economic construction.
