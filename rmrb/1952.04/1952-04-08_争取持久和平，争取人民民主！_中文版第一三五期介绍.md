The Chinese edition of the Cominform organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 135, has been published.

This issue, in celebration of the March 8th International Women's Day, features an editorial entitled "Women are a Great Force in the Struggle for Peace" and an article by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, entitled "Women in the People's Republic of China." The editorial points out: This year, working women in all countries are commemorating March 8th under the slogan of strengthening the struggle for peace and opposing the new world war crisis being prepared by the American and British imperialists. The international solidarity of working women is growing stronger every day. The Women's International Democratic Federation, uniting 135 million women in sixty-four countries, has waged an unyielding struggle for peace, for the economic and political rights of working women, and for the lives and future of their children. The ranks of the great Soviet women are at the forefront of the international women's democratic movement. Along with Soviet women are the women of China and the people's democratic countries. The new systems established in these countries give women the same rights as men, guiding them to actively participate in political, economic, and cultural life. On the other hand, the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries talk glibly about "democracy," "freedom," and "equality," but at the same time do not treat women as human beings and deprive them of their basic rights. The situation of women in colonies and dependent countries is even more tragic. The expansion of armaments and the militarization of the economy by the governments of capitalist countries have increasingly deteriorated the situation of working women and children. The editorial emphasizes that in the struggle for peace and against the instigators of a new world war, the political consciousness and organization of working women are maturing. The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries highly value the militant activities of women and their selfless struggle for peace; they will continue to do everything in their power to promote this struggle, to thwart the conspiracies of the warmongers, and to absorb all women into the peace movement.

Révai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, published an article entitled "The Sixtieth Birthday of Rákosi," stating: March 9th is Comrade Rákosi's sixtieth birthday. Révai then introduced Rákosi's life and activities in detail, pointing out: Rákosi has been engaged in revolutionary activities for forty years, which is a long and historically significant period—from the crisis of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the consolidation of the Hungarian People's Democratic regime. In these forty years, he experienced two Russian revolutions and three Hungarian revolutions; he fought during the high tide of the European working class revolutionary movement from 1918 to 1923, and then fought during the low tide of the revolutionary movement and the period of relative stability of capitalism; he spent fifteen years in Horthy's prison; he worked during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, preparing the Party and the people to meet the liberation of their homeland, and after the Soviet army liberated Hungary, he led the Hungarian Communist Party in the struggle for the power of the working class; and now he is leading the work of socialist construction. In these forty years, under various conditions of class struggle, in periods of advance and retreat, in underground environments and in the open struggle of the working class party in power, he has accumulated rich experience, mastered various forms of class struggle, learned to estimate the conditions of various political struggles in his activities, and has always remained true to the starting point of his political path—he has always been a communist revolutionary, a fearless fighter, uncompromising on the principled issues of the revolutionary movement, and infinitely loyal to the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin. This is the significance of the Hungarian people celebrating Comrade Rákosi's sixtieth birthday.

This issue publishes an article by Kindelski-Czowski, a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "On the Draft Constitution of the Polish Republic." The author says: The Polish people are currently in great days. The draft constitution of the Polish Republic is being discussed all over the country. The new constitution will summarize the achievements won by the Polish working people under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Polish United Workers' Party, and on the basis of the friendship, assistance, and example provided by the great Soviet Union. The author points out: Throughout the history of Poland, there have been various constitutions, but none of them have been constitutions of the people and for the benefit of the people. Only the new draft constitution declares for the first time that power belongs to the working people of town and country. The author then elaborates on the political institutions, the rights and obligations of citizens, and the national and foreign policies mentioned in the draft constitution, and concludes by saying: The draft constitution has been warmly welcomed by the Polish people. The working people have held meetings to thoroughly discuss the draft constitution and have put forward some amendments to the draft. The people believe that the draft constitution fulfills their long-cherished aspirations, reflects their achievements and victories, and reflects the prospects for further free development of the Polish people.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三五期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三五期已经出版。
    本期为庆祝三八国际妇女节，发表了题为“妇女是争取和平斗争中的伟大力量”的社论，并刊载了中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超的题为“妇女在中华人民共和国”的文章。社论指出：今年，各国劳动妇女都在加强争取和平的斗争和反对美英帝国主义者正在准备的另一次世界战争危机的口号下，纪念三八节。劳动妇女们的国际团结是一天天地加强了。团结着六十四个国家中一亿三千五百万妇女的国际民主妇女联合会，为争取和平、争取劳动妇女的经济政治权利、争取她们的孩子们的生活和前途，进行了坚忍不拔的斗争。伟大的苏联妇女的队伍走在国际妇女民主运动的最前列。和苏联妇女一道的有中国和各人民民主国家的妇女们。这些国家里创立的新制度给妇女们以和男子同样的权利，引导她们积极参加政治、经济和文化的生活。另一方面，美、英、法及其他资本主义国家的头目们奢谈“民主”、“自由”和“平等”，但同时却不把妇女当作人看待，并剥夺她们的基本权利。殖民地和附属国的妇女的境况则更加悲惨。资本主义各国政府进行的扩张军备运动和经济的军事化，已使劳动妇女和儿童的境况日益恶化。社论强调说：在争取和平、反对新世界战争煽动者的斗争中，劳动妇女的政治觉悟和组织性正在成熟起来。一切国家的共产党和工人党对于妇女的战斗性活动以及她们为争取和平的忘我斗争，都有极高的评价；它们在将来仍将竭尽一切力量促进这个斗争，以挫败战争贩子的阴谋，并吸收全体妇女参加到和平运动中来。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员里瓦伊发表题为“拉科西的六十寿辰”的文章说：三月九日是拉科西同志的六十寿辰。里瓦伊接着详尽地介绍了拉科西的生平和活动，他指出：拉科西从事了四十年的革命活动，这四十年是很长的一段富有历史意义的时期——从奥匈帝国的危机到匈牙利人民民主政权的巩固。在这四十年中，他经过了两次俄国的革命和三次匈牙利的革命；他在一九一八年到一九二三年欧洲工人阶级革命运动的高潮时期战斗过，以后又在革命运动的低潮时期、资本主义相对稳定的时期战斗过；他在霍尔梯监狱中度过了十五年；他在苏联伟大卫国战争期间进行了工作，使党和人民有所准备，以便迎接他们祖国的解放，并且在苏军解放了匈牙利以后，领导匈牙利共产党进行争取工人阶级的政权的斗争；现在又领导着社会主义建设的工作。在这四十年中，在阶级斗争的各种不同的条件下，在前进时期和退却时期，在地下环境中和工人阶级的政党执政的公开斗争时期，他积累了丰富的经验，精通了各种不同的阶级斗争形式，在活动中学会了估量各种政治斗争的条件，同时又始终忠于他的政治道路的出发点——他始终是一位共产主义的革命家，一位无畏的战士，在革命运动的原则问题上毫不妥协，对列宁—斯大林的伟大的思想抱有无限的忠心。匈牙利人民庆贺拉科西同志六十寿辰，其意义就在这里。
    本期刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员金德利朝夫斯基的“论波兰共和国宪法草案”一文。作者说：波兰人民目前正处在伟大的日子里。全国各地正在纷纷讨论波兰共和国的宪法草案。新宪法将总结波兰劳动人民在工人阶级及其先锋队波兰统一工人党的领导下，并在伟大苏联的友好、援助与提供榜样的基础上所已赢得的成就。作者指出：在波兰的整个历史上，曾有过各种各样的宪法，但没有一个是人民的和替人民造福的宪法。只有新的宪法草案才第一次宣布政权属于城乡劳动人民。作者接着对宪法草案中所提到的政治机构、公民的权利与义务，以及民族政策和外交政策等问题加以阐释，并在结语中说：宪法草案受到了波兰人民的热烈欢迎。劳动人民纷纷举行会议对宪法草案进行彻底的讨论，并对草案提出了若干修正。人民认为宪法草案实现了他们的夙愿，反映了他们的成就和胜利，反映了波兰人民进一步自由发展的前途。（新华社）
