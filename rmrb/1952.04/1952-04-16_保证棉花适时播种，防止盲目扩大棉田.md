    Ensure Timely Cotton Planting, Prevent Blind Expansion of Cotton Fields
    Timely sowing and ensuring full stands are the main keys to a bumper cotton harvest. Although the sowing period for cotton varies depending on the local climate, farming system, and cotton varieties, it generally should not be earlier than mid-April or later than late May, with the period from Grain Rain to Start of Summer being the most suitable. Planting too late shortens the growing season of the cotton plants, causing them to flower and form bolls but not open, suffering frost damage and reducing yields. Planting too early, even if there is enough moisture in the soil, often results in slow and uneven emergence due to insufficient soil temperature for cotton seed germination. Seedlings are also at risk of spring frost and wind damage, and are susceptible to diseases such as seedling blight and anthracnose, leading to missing stands. In 1950, some cotton farmers in Shanxi and Hebei suffered losses because they took advantage of rainfall to plant cotton early.
    According to letters from Comrades Wang Fengxiu and Zhang Guogang of the Xingtai Special District, Hebei Province, some cotton farmers in Shahe and other counties have already started sowing in late March. The phenomenon of blindly expanding cotton fields has also been observed in some areas. Therefore, we put forward the following suggestions:
    1. In areas where there has been no rainfall, the idea of waiting for rain to sow should be corrected to avoid delaying the appropriate sowing time. In cotton-growing areas where there has been spring rainfall, attention should be paid to preventing cotton farmers from taking advantage of the moisture to rush planting too early, so as to avoid poor germination and losses. The current main task in rainy areas is to vigorously lead the masses to harrow and rake more to maintain and conserve soil moisture.
    2. Resolutely implement the "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, correct the attitude of some people who believe that "the moisture is good this year, so we should plant more cotton," and prevent the blind expansion of cotton fields. Strengthen patriotic education for farmers to increase production, so as to concentrate efforts on improving the yield of cotton per unit area.
    3. In areas where sowing has already been advanced, immediate efforts should be made to check the seedlings, replant, and protect the seedlings; and prepare an appropriate amount of cotton seeds for replanting. Strengthen technical guidance on early weeding, multiple weeding, thinning, and transplanting to prevent the occurrence of diseases during the seedling stage and vigorously ensure full stands in cotton fields.

### 保证棉花适时播种，防止盲目扩大棉田

    保证棉花适时播种，防止盲目扩大棉田
    适时播种，保证全苗，是棉花丰产的主要关键。棉花的播种期虽因各地的气候、耕作制度，及棉花品种的不同而有差别，但大致上总不能早于四月中旬，迟于五月下旬，而以谷雨到立夏期间为最适宜。过晚播种，减短了棉花的生长期，棉株开花结桃而不能开絮，遭受霜害，减低收成。过于提早播种，即使土壤中水分够用，但因地温不够棉籽发芽需要，出苗常常迟缓不齐，幼苗也有遭遇春霜冻害和风害的危险，且易感染立枯病、炭疽病等，发生缺苗现象。一九五零年山西、河北部分棉农曾因趁雨提早种棉，遭受了损失。
    根据河北省邢台专区王凤秀、张国刚两同志来信，沙河等县有些棉农在三月下旬已开始播种。盲目扩大棉田的现象也已在若干地区发现。为此，我们提出以下几点意见：
    一、未降雨的地区，应纠正农民等雨播种的思想，以免耽误播种的适当时期。已降春雨的棉区，则应注意防止棉农趁墒抢早种棉，以免发芽不良，遭受损失。落雨地区当前主要的任务是大力领导群众多耙多耢，做好养墒、保墒工作。
    二、坚决贯彻中央人民政府政务院“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”，纠正某些群众认为“今年墒好要多种棉花”的情绪，防止盲目扩大棉田。加强对农民的爱国增产的教育，以便集中力量提高棉花单位面积的产量。
    三、已经提早播种的地区，应立即进行查苗、补苗、保苗工作；并准备适量棉籽以备补播。要加强早锄、多锄、间苗、移苗的技术指导，防止幼苗期间病害的发生，大力保证棉田全苗。
