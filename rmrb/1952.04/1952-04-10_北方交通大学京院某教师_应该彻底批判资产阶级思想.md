To the Editor: A certain associate professor in the Architecture Department of the Beijing Institute of Northern Jiaotong University harbors serious bourgeois ideology.

He constantly flaunts his "Master's" title. He says, "There are only four of us in the whole country who have a 'Urban Planning' Master's degree." When he was still a lecturer, he said, "If I don't get the position of associate professor within a year, I will commit suicide in front of my lover!"

What does he teach his students in class? He says, "Slums are breeding grounds for criminals," "It's dirty along the railway tracks, so slums should be set up there," "Excessive urban population can be moved to the colonies." He even brought out a set of fallacies such as "how to divide races into black and white," "alcoholism causes trouble," and "the formation of slums." When teaching students to design buildings, he tells them to design them to be "weird" so they can "become famous."

This teacher's thinking is so decadent and filthy, but he is unwilling to conduct a self-criticism in front of the masses in order to reform himself. In his self-criticism, he also said that overseas Chinese in the United States are only engaged in "laundry," "cooking," and other "lowly" work, and that they are "not ambitious," so they are discriminated against by American imperialism. He also described American imperialism's cultural aggression against our country as American imperialism's "good intentions." When students raise opinions about the "urban planning" he teaches, he says, "What bad luck, I shouldn't have studied architecture, I should have studied water conservancy." This shows that his attitude towards ideological remolding is very wrong. We earnestly hope that this professor will correct his attitude towards learning, deeply criticize his erroneous ideas, and thoroughly reform himself. Only in this way can he be welcomed by the students.

### 北方交通大学京院某教师  应该彻底批判资产阶级思想

    北方交通大学京院某教师
    应该彻底批判资产阶级思想
    编辑同志：北方交通大学京院建筑系的一位副教授，有严重的资产阶级思想。
    他时常卖弄他的“硕士”衔头，他说：“全国得到‘都市计划’硕士学位的，只有我们四个人。”当他还是讲师的时候，他说：“一年之内要是得不到副教授的职位，就自杀于爱人的跟前！”
    他在课堂上向学生讲授些什么呢？他说：“贫民窟是罪犯的渊薮”，“铁路两旁肮脏，宜设贫民窟”，“都市过多的人口，可移到殖民地去”。他甚至还把“人种如何分黑白”、“酗酒肇祸”、“贫民窟的形成”等一套谬论也搬了出来。他教学生设计建筑物时要设计得“怪些”，说这样才能“成名”。
    这位教师的思想这么腐朽肮脏，但是他却不愿在群众面前进行检讨，以便改造自己。在检讨中他还说，华侨在美国干的尽是“洗衣”、“烧饭”等
    “下贱”工作，他们“不争气”，所以被美帝国主义歧视。他又把美帝国主义对我国的文化侵略说成是美帝国主义的“好意”。当同学对他所教的“都市计划”提出意见时，他便说：“真倒霉，我不该学建筑，要是学水利就好了。”这说明了他对思想改造的态度是非常错误的。我们恳切地希望这位教授端正自己的学习态度，深刻地批判自己的错误思想，彻底改造自己，只有这样，才能受到同学的欢迎。
