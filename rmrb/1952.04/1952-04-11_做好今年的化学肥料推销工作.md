Do a Good Job in Promoting Chemical Fertilizers This Year
    Jiang Xia

Of the 2.28 million tons of commercial fertilizer supplied to various regions across the country (excluding the Northeast) by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives this year, 280,000 tons are chemical fertilizers. Although this supply number is not very large, it should attract everyone's attention. Because, with the development of China's industry, the production of chemical fertilizers will inevitably increase day by day. Therefore, we should now pay attention to guiding farmers to gradually become familiar with the use of chemical fertilizers, and prepare ideologically and technically for the large-scale promotion of chemical fertilizers in the future. In terms of quantity, the effectiveness of 280,000 tons of chemical fertilizer is roughly equivalent to 840,000 tons of cake fertilizer, and the value is equivalent to more than one-third of the fertilizer supplied by cooperatives this year. Because most farmers in our country do not have the habit of using chemical fertilizers, the promotion of this batch of chemical fertilizers cannot be ignored.

This year, in addition to continuing to supply areas that have traditionally used chemical fertilizers, cooperatives have also paid attention to focusing on supplying areas that have rarely used chemical fertilizers in the past, such as the Southwest region and Shanxi, Chahar in North China, and Hubei and Hunan provinces in Central and South China. The supply of chemical fertilizers to Shaanxi Province in Northwest China is four times more than last year.

The Effectiveness of Chemical Fertilizers

There are several kinds of chemical fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and superphosphate. The chemical fertilizer supplied by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives this year is mostly ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate, also known as sulfur ammonium, is a fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer. The experience of farmers in the eastern and southern coastal areas of China in using this chemical fertilizer, as well as the results of agricultural science experiments conducted by the Central Ministry of Agriculture in various parts of the country, have proved that it has a very good effect. For example, applying 40 kilograms of sulfur ammonium per mu can increase rice production by 142 kilograms, with an average increase of 3.6 kilograms per kilogram; applying the same amount to wheat fields can increase wheat production by 101 kilograms, with an average increase of 2.5 kilograms per kilogram; applying it to cotton fields can increase seed cotton production by 37.5 kilograms, with an average increase of 0.93 kilograms per kilogram. The above figures are the average results of experiments in hundreds of regions and are not fixed. Under various suitable conditions (such as suitable soil, climate, and water conservancy irrigation), it can also exert greater effectiveness.

Break Down Farmers' Concerns

The experience of using chemical fertilizers in many areas has proved that when farmers do not yet have the habit of using chemical fertilizers, they have great concerns about using this fertilizer. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to carry out in-depth publicity work to break down farmers' concerns. Some farmers base their concerns on erroneous experiences, believing that "chemical fertilizers will deplete the land," "long-term use will make the land harden and nothing will grow," and "using chemical fertilizers will burn crops." Some rural work cadres also follow the masses and take an unwarranted cold or even resistant attitude towards the application of chemical fertilizers. Their only reason is: "Farmers are not used to using chemical fertilizers." Last year, a considerable amount of the chemical fertilizer supplied by cooperatives to various regions was therefore stockpiled, resulting in waste.

Chemical fertilizers will not deplete the land. Chemical fertilizer is a fertilizer that does not contain organic matter, is rich in soluble substances, and is easily absorbed by plants. It is only sometimes because chemical fertilizers are used alone and less organic fertilizer (i.e., farm fertilizer, such as compost, manure, and green manure) is used that the organic matter left in the ground in the past will gradually decompose and decrease; if the application of chemical fertilizer is stopped the following year, and the amount of organic fertilizer applied is still as much as before the application of chemical fertilizer, the nutrients contained in the soil will be relatively reduced. Also, because of the decomposition and reduction of organic matter in the ground, it may also cause soil hardening, which will hinder crop growth. The above two situations are caused by the sole application of chemical fertilizer and less use of organic fertilizer. As long as they are used in combination (such as using organic fertilizer as base fertilizer and chemical fertilizer as top dressing), the above-mentioned problems will not occur. Some people think that "crops grow well in the first year of applying chemical fertilizer, and more must be used in the second year, and it will not work even if more is used later." This statement has no scientific basis at all. Chemical fertilizers will not burn crops either; it is only when too much is applied at one time, or too close to the roots of the crops, or when applied to seeds that are germinating, that the crops will be damaged due to the chemical decomposition of the fertilizer. The above phenomena are all caused by improper use of chemical fertilizers. As long as it is used properly, chemical fertilizer will exert a great effect.

Strengthen Technical Guidance and Oppose Blind Promotion

In the work of publicizing and organizing farmers to use chemical fertilizers, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments of governments at all levels must cooperate closely and strengthen technical guidance. We must oppose the blind promotion of chemical fertilizers; in areas where technical conditions are not yet available, it is better not to promote them for the time being. We must ensure that wherever chemical fertilizers are promoted, technical guidance will follow. The cooperative in the North Sichuan District once decided to cooperate with the North Sichuan Administrative Office's Agricultural and Forestry Department's chemical fertilizer training class to focus on demonstrations in counties, districts, and townships where chemical fertilizers are used, and to provide roving guidance on application techniques. In March of this year, Hunan Province instructed its subordinates to cooperate with relevant departments to compile instructions for applying chemical fertilizers and to run small technical training classes or hold technical seminars in areas where chemical fertilizers are used. These methods are also very necessary.

Correctly Grasp Fertilizer Prices

The price of chemical fertilizers should be correctly grasped. The effectiveness of one kilogram of chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) is roughly equivalent to three kilograms of cake fertilizer; therefore, its price should also be based on the principle of not exceeding the price of three kilograms of cake fertilizer. When promoting chemical fertilizers, cooperatives should encourage farmers to purchase voluntarily and resolutely oppose the phenomenon of forced apportionment. Last year, some cooperatives apportioned several kilograms to each household on average, regardless of the situation; this coercive order style must be prevented this year.

Chemical fertilizers have great development prospects. We must do a good job in promoting them this year to lay a good foundation for widespread use in the future.

### 做好今年的化学肥料推销工作

    做好今年的化学肥料推销工作
    江夏
    今年由全国合作总社供应各地（不包括东北在内）的二百二十八万吨商品肥料中，有二十八万吨是化学肥料，这个供应数字虽然还不很大，但却应引起大家的重视。因为，随着我国工业的发展，化学肥料的产量必将日趋增加。因此，当前就应当注意引导农民逐渐熟悉使用化学肥料，为将来大量地推广使用化学肥料做好思想上和技术上的准备工作。就数量来说，二十八万吨化学肥料的效力约可抵八十四万吨饼肥，价值等于今年合作社供应的肥料的三分之一以上。因为我国大部农民还没有使用化学肥料的习惯，这一批化学肥料的推销工作是不可忽视的。
    今年合作社除了继续供应过去习惯使用化学肥料的地区以外，还注意了重点供应过去很少使用过化学肥料的地区，如西南地区和华北的山西、察哈尔、中南的湖北、湖南等省，供应西北陕西省的化学肥料则较去年多出四倍。
    化学肥料的效能
    化学肥料有好几种，如硫酸铵、硝酸铵、过鏻酸钙等。今年由全国合作总社供应的化学肥料绝大部分是硫酸铵。硫酸铵也叫硫铵，是一种速效的氮素肥料。我国东部、南部沿海一带的农民使用这种化学肥料的经验，以及中央农业部农业科学试验所在全国各地试验的结果，都证明它的效果很好。例如每亩地施用四十斤硫铵，可以增产水稻一百四十二斤，平均每斤可增产三点六斤；以同等的数量施用于麦田，可增产小麦一百零一斤，平均每斤可增产二斤半；施用于棉田可增产籽棉三十七斤半，平均每斤可增产零点九三斤。上述的数字是几百个地区试验结果的平均数字，并不是肯定不变的。在各种适宜的条件下（如适宜的土壤、气候、水利灌溉等），还可以发挥它更大的效能。
    打破农民的顾虑
    很多地区使用化学肥料的经验证明，当农民还没有使用化学肥料习惯的时候，他们对使用这种肥料是有很大顾虑的。因此，首先要向农民进行深入的宣传工作，打破农民的顾虑。有些农民以错误的经验作根据，认为“化学肥料会拔地力”，“用久了会使土地板结，寸草不生”，“用化学肥料会烧死庄稼”等。还有些农村工作干部，也跟在群众后面，对施用化学肥料采取了不应有的冷淡甚至是抵抗的态度，他们唯一理由是：“农民不习惯使用化学肥料”。去年合作社供应各地的化学肥料，就曾因此有不少被积压而形成费浪。
    化学肥料是不会拔地力的。化学肥料是一种不含有机质、富有可溶性而易于被植物吸收的肥料。只是有时因为单纯施用化学肥料而少用有机肥料（即农家肥料，如堆肥、圈肥、绿肥等），地里过去遗留下来的有机质就会逐渐分解而减少；第二年若停止施用化学肥料，而有机肥料的施用量仍和施用化学肥料以前一般多时，土壤中所含存的养分就会相对减少。又因为地里的有机质分解减少的关系，也就可能引起土壤板结，使作物生长受到妨碍。以上两种情况都是因为单纯施用化学肥料而少用有机肥料的缘故。只要把它们配合施用（如以有机肥料做基肥，化学肥料做追肥），就不会发生上面所说的毛病。有些人认为“第一年施用化学肥料作物生长得好，第二年就得多用，以后再多用也不行了”，这种说法是完全没有科学根据的。化学肥料也不会把庄稼烧死；只是一次施用量过多，或太接近庄稼的根部，或施于正在萌芽的种子时，才会因肥料的化学分解作用而使庄稼受到损害。上述现象都是由于使用化学肥料的方法不当而引起的。只要使用恰当，化学肥料会发挥它很大的作用。
    加强技术指导，反对盲目推销
    在宣传和组织农民使用化学肥料的工作中，供销合作社、各级政府的农业部门必须互相密切配合，加强技术指导。要反对盲目地推销化学肥料；在技术条件还不具备的地区，宁可暂不推销。要做到化学肥料推销到那里，技术指导也就跟到那里。川北区合作社曾决定配合川北行署农林厅化学肥料训练班到使用化学肥料的县、区、乡重点示范，巡回指导施用技术。湖南省在今年三月，曾指示所属配合有关部门编制了施用化学肥料的说明书，在使用化学肥料的地区开办小型技术训练班或召开技术座谈会。这些办法也都是很必要的。
    正确地掌握肥料价格
    应当正确地掌握化学肥料的价格。一斤化学肥料
    （硫铵）的效能大体相当于三斤饼肥；因此，其价格也应以不超过三斤饼肥的价格为原则。合作社在推销化学肥料时，要启发农民自愿购买，坚决反对强迫摊派的现象。去年有的合作社不问情况，每户平均摊派几斤；这种强迫命令的作风，今年必须注意防止。
    化学肥料有很大的发展前途，我们必须做好今年的推销工作，为将来普遍大量使用打下良好的基础。
