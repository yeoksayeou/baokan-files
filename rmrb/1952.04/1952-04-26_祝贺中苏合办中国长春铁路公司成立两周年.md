Congratulations on the Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company
Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, Teng Daiyuan

The Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company has been established for two years! Over the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Board of Directors of the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company, and through the close cooperation and active labor of all Chinese and Soviet employees, the Changchun Railway has achieved remarkable accomplishments. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company, I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, extend my highest respect to all the comrades working on the Changchun Railway, and congratulate you on your glorious achievements over the past two years.

The substantial progress of the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company in the past two years specifically demonstrates the consolidation and development of the friendly and mutually beneficial relationship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet comrades serving on the Changchun Railway possess the excellent qualities of people educated under the socialist system. They have demonstrated a high degree of principle and responsibility in their work, and have earnestly and gradually promoted various advanced technologies, working methods, and scientific working systems of the Soviet Union in railway management to the Changchun Railway, making the Changchun Railway look new every day and setting a model for the Chinese People's Railways to learn from. The contributions of the Soviet comrades are enormous. Let me express my heartfelt thanks to you, and thank you for embodying the great friendship and assistance of the Soviet people and Marshal Stalin.

The Chinese comrades serving on the Changchun Railway, abiding by Chairman Mao Zedong's glorious instructions, have sincerely learned from the Soviet comrades and have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their work. I extend my cordial regards for your hard work over the past two years.

Thanks to the cooperative efforts of Chinese and Soviet employees, the Changchun Railway Company completed the state-assigned transportation tasks twenty-three days ahead of schedule last year, and also overfulfilled its business plan. The attention and improvement given to the working conditions, cultural, and material lives of the employees by the Changchun Railway is also worthy of close study by all units of the Chinese People's Railways.

The experience of the Changchun Railway over the past two years proves that only by combining the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in railway management can the cause of Chinese railway construction move forward by leaps and bounds. The Chinese comrades working on the Changchun Railway have consistently and unremittingly, systematically, and organizationally learned from the Soviet comrades in the past, and have provided great assistance to the comrades from other Chinese railways who came to the Changchun Railway to learn. This work is extremely beneficial. Various advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, such as the Kovalev working method, five hundred car kilometers, over-axle, new shunting method, loading method, Nefedov track maintenance method, etc., have not only created typical examples on the Changchun Railway, and labor models such as Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, Yang Maolin, and Qiao Yuyan have been effective in their work, but also, after being promoted to other Chinese railways, they have all been accurate in their application and have greatly promoted the progress of work. The Chinese comrades of the Changchun Railway must learn from the Soviet comrades more closely and practically, learn earnestly, learn more, and learn thoroughly. This task is arduous and glorious.

Over the past two years, the development and progress of the Changchun Railway has played a significant role in the consolidation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and in the advancement of the Chinese People's Railway construction cause. Let us wish the Changchun Railway Company a more rapid advancement on the basis of its past work, and after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has cleared the obstacles to increasing production and practicing economy, to model completion of this year's national tasks, and to vigorously welcome the country's economic construction with greater work achievements.

Long live the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet people!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
Long live Marshal Stalin, the teacher of the working people of the world!

    祝贺中苏合办中国长春铁路公司成立两周年
    中央人民政府铁道部部长  滕代远
    中苏合办中国长春铁路公司成立已经两周年了！两年来，中长铁路在中苏合办中长铁路公司理事会的正确领导下，经过全体中苏员工的密切合作和积极劳动，已经获得了卓越的成就。今当中苏合办中国长春铁路公司成立两周年之际，我谨代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，向中长铁路全体工作同志们致以崇高的敬意，对你们两年来的光辉成绩表示祝贺。
    中苏合办中国长春铁路公司成立两年来的长足进步，具体表现了中苏两大民族友好互助关系的巩固和发展。
    服务于中长铁路的苏联同志们，具有社会主义制度教育下的人民的优秀品质，在工作中表现了高度的原则性和负责精神，把苏联经营管理铁路的各种先进技术、工作方法和科学的工作制度认真地逐步推行在中长铁路上，使得中长铁路面貌日新，给中国人民铁路树立了学习的榜样。苏联同志们的贡献是巨大的，让我向你们表示衷心的谢意，感谢你们所体现着的苏联人民和斯大林大元帅的伟大友谊和帮助。
    服务于中长铁路的中国同志们，恪遵着毛泽东主席的光荣嘱托，诚恳地向苏联同志们学习，在工作中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，对于两年来的辛勤劳动，谨致以亲切的慰问。
    由于中苏员工的合作努力，中长铁路公司去年又提前二十三天完成了国家所给予的运输任务，而且也超额完成了经营计划。中长铁路在职工劳动条件和文化、物质生活方面所给予的注意和改善，也是值得中国人民铁路各个单位加紧学习的。
    中长铁路两年来的经验证明，只有把广大职工的积极性创造性和苏联经营管理铁路的先进经验结合起来，才能使中国铁路建设事业大踏步地向前迈进。在中长铁路工作的中国同志们过去曾继续不懈地、有计划地、有组织地向苏联同志们学习，并且对中国其他铁路来中长铁路学习的同志们给以极大的帮助，这一工作是极为有益的。苏联的各种先进经验，如郭瓦廖夫工作方法、五百日车公里、超轴、新调车法、装车法、聂菲铎夫养路法等等，不仅在中长铁路上创造了典型，郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林、乔玉岩等劳动模范已经行之有效，而且推广到中国其他铁路以后，也都用之皆准，大大地推动了工作前进。中长铁路的中国同志们必须更加紧地实实在在地向苏联同志们学习，要认真地学，要学得多，要学得透彻。这个任务是艰巨而光荣的。
    两年来，中长铁路的发展和前进对中苏两国人民友好的巩固与发展，对中国人民铁路建设事业的前进，是有着重大作用的。让我们预祝中长铁路公司在过去的工作基础上，在经过反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动扫清了增产节约的障碍以后，更加迅速地向前迈进，模范地完成今年的国家任务，用更大的工作成就来有力地迎接国家的经济建设。
    中苏两国人民的友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    世界劳动人民的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
