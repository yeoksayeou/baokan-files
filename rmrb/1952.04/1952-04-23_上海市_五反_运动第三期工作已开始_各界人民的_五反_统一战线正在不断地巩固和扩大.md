Shanghai’s “Five-Anti” movement staff, after achieving significant victories in the first and second phases, took a seven-day break from April 13th to 19th for rest, experience summarization, and detailed preparation for the third phase. Now, the planned rest and the preparatory work for the third phase have been successfully completed. The Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee officially notified all districts on the 20th to begin the third phase of the "Five-Anti" movement.

During the break, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committees of all districts held meetings for "Five-Anti" staff to earnestly and deeply summarize experiences and study working methods for the third phase. The experience exchange conferences or small-scale summary meetings held in various districts particularly focused on studying how to mobilize the masses and how to promote the voluntary confession of illegal capitalists.

During the break, various districts also adjusted their teams based on the experience of the previous two phases and the needs of the third phase, thereby greatly enhancing work efficiency. A large number of activists who emerged during the movement have been absorbed into the "Five-Anti" work and selected to serve as leading cadres. The "Five-Anti" staff in Xincheng District increased by one-third, and Songshan District promoted more than one hundred "Five-Anti" work cadres from workers and shop assistants.

During the break, leaders at all levels particularly emphasized the importance of strictly abiding by policies, observing discipline, and conducting work in a led and orderly manner according to unified deployment. Penglai District conducted an inspection of the execution of policies and observance of discipline by each squadron. Jing'an District also educated all staff by conducting a general inspection and correcting certain incidents that violated policies and discipline. The Yimiao District conducted a special inspection of propaganda discipline and conducted in-depth education for all propaganda cadres.

During the break, various districts also carried out some more in-depth publicity activities to further ensure the thorough completion of the third phase. In the North Station District, more than 10,000 Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, propagandists, activists, workers, and shop assistants conducted in-depth propaganda in a planned manner, enabling the majority of industrial and commercial households in the district to better understand the policies.

In addition, thousands of capitalists in Shanghai who had confessed their problems in the second phase of the "Five-Anti" campaign have requested to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes to the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committees of various districts, and hundreds of "meritorious service groups" have been established. Many family members of capitalists participating in the meritorious service groups have also participated in the family work groups of the "Five-Anti" work organizations in various districts. Now, they have begun to persuade the illegal capitalists who have not yet confessed to quickly choose the path of self-renewal as "people who have come over." After receiving the notification of review and decision, many small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households thanked the people's government and the working class for their leniency, and voluntarily publicized and advised other industrial and commercial households, pointing out that the only correct path for all illegal capitalists is to quickly confess and perform meritorious service.

Shanghai’s “Five-Anti” movement is developing forward with a magnificent momentum; the “Five-Anti” united front of people from all walks of life is constantly being consolidated and expanded; after rest and training, all the "Five-Anti" staff have become more brave and resourceful, and have devoted themselves to the third phase of work, striving for the great goal of the basic victory of the entire "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai.

    上海市“五反”运动第三期工作已开始
    各界人民的“五反”统一战线正在不断地巩固和扩大
    上海市“五反”运动的全体工作人员，在连续取得第一第二两期的重大胜利后，从四月十三日起到十九日止，以七天时间进行休整，总结经验，并对第三期工作作了详密的准备。现在，预定的休整任务和对于第三期的准备工作，业已胜利完成，市增产节约委员会已在二十日通知各区正式开始“五反”运动第三期的工作。
    在休整期间，各区增产节约委员会普遍召开“五反”工作人员会议，认真深入地总结经验，和研究第三期的工作方法。各区召开的经验交流大会或小型总结会，特别着重研究了发动群众和如何促使违法资本家自动坦白交代问题。
    各区在休整期中，并根据前两期的经验和第三期工作的需要，进行了调整队伍的工作，因而使工作效率大为加强。运动中涌现出来的大批积极分子，已被吸收参加“五反”工作和被选拔担任领导干部。新成区“五反”工作人员增加了三分之一，嵩山区从工人店员中提拔了一百多个“五反”工作干部。
    在休整中，各级领导方面又特别强调了严守政策、遵守纪律和按照统一部署有领导有秩序地进行工作的重要性。蓬莱区曾对各中队执行政策和遵守纪律的情况作了一次检查。静安区也通过普遍检查、纠正某些违反政策和纪律的事件，教育了全体工作人员。邑庙区对宣传纪律作了专门的检查，并对所有宣传干部进行了深入的教育。
    在休整期间，各区还进行了一些较为深入的宣传活动，使第三期工作的彻底完成更有了保证。北站区曾有一万多共产党员、青年团员、宣传员、积极分子、工人店员，有计划地进行了深入宣传，使全区的大多数工商户更了解了政策。
    此外，上海市“五反”第二期中已坦白交代了自己问题的成千资本家，纷纷向各区增产节约委员会请求立功赎罪，上百个“立功小组”已经建立；许多参加立功小组的资本家的家属，也参加了各区“五反”工作机构的家属工作组。现在，他们已开始以“过来人”的身份，劝说尚未坦白的违法资本家迅速选择自新的道路。许多中小工商户在审查定案收到通知书后，更是感谢人民政府和工人阶级的宽大，自动地向其他工商户宣传规劝，指出一切违法资本家只有迅速坦白立功，才是正确的道路。
    上海市的“五反”运动，正以波涛壮阔的形势向前发展；各界人民的“五反”统一战线，正在不断巩固与扩大；经过休整训练以后的全体“五反”工作人员，已经更加勇敢、机智地投入第三期工作，为第三期的伟大目的——争取上海市整个“五反”运动的基本胜利而斗争。    （新华社）
