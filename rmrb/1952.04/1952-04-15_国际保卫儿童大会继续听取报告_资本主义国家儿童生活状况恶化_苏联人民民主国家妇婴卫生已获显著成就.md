Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 14th. The International Conference for the Defence of Children continued its session on the afternoon of the 12th, chaired by Indian representative Chowdhury.

Professor Perotti, a member of the Italian Parliament, delivered a report on "Children's Health Issues" at the meeting.

Perotti said that there is reason to be alarmed by the health conditions of most children in the capitalist world. Malnutrition, poor living environments, poverty, and unsatisfactory medical services are the causes of widespread illness and death among children in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies. In the Americas and Western European countries, funding for public health, social facilities, cultural undertakings, and civilian production is being continuously reduced to increase military expenditure. For example, in France, military expenditure accounts for 50 percent of the budget, while public health allocations only account for 1 percent. The situation is roughly the same in other Western countries. The result of these countries' war preparations is the deterioration of domestic living conditions and the continuous decline in population reproduction.

Perotti went on to describe the remarkable achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, China, and the German Democratic Republic in public health and the care of women and infants, and emphasized: We must take the work of protecting children's health and material welfare into our own hands. Therefore, we have an obligation to resolutely fight to defend peace, improve living conditions, and oppose soaring prices and taxes. We must demand that governments expand children's medical institutions, protect young workers, prohibit the employment of child labor and the sale of children, and establish orphanages.

Gilpin, Chairman of the British Committee for the Defence of Children, then delivered a report on "Children's Education Issues." Gilpin pointed out that illiteracy accounts for a large percentage of the world's population. The education situation in many capitalist countries is very bad. For example, in the United States, only a quarter of all children receive very little education, and four million school-age children receive no education at all. A major factor currently hindering the development of education is the ever-increasing and huge military expenditure and the use of manpower and materials for war preparations. For example, in the United Kingdom, military expenditure has almost doubled in two years, while education expenditure has only increased by 14 percent. While describing the unsatisfactory school buildings in many capitalist countries, Gilpin pointed out that the Soviet Union is an example of solving the school building problem. Despite the damage suffered by the Soviet Union in the Second World War, its school buildings have been fully developed after the war.

Gilpin then put forward several suggestions, including increasing education funding in various countries, implementing subsidies in educational institutions, improving the material conditions of teachers, prohibiting corporal punishment, and educating children with the spirit of collectivism and respect for other nations. Gilpin finally pointed out that all of this is only possible in times of peace. For the sake of children, we need world peace.

Dr. Grosskurt, a doctor from West Berlin, delivered a report on "The Impact of Literature, Newspapers, Radio, Movies, and Art on the Spiritual and Cultural Development of Children." She called on everyone to pay attention to the harmful effects of cheap reading materials and gangster movies shipped by the United States to various countries. She said that under the influence of American "art," juvenile crime is increasing every year. American courts interrogate the cases of 275,000 children every year. The number of juvenile offenders in Japan was 28,000 in 1945, but it increased to 75,000 in 1948. Grosskurt concluded by saying that governments must be required to enact laws to protect children from the influence of cheap reading materials, bad radio broadcasts, and movies. The conference should call on parents, teachers, and doctors to organize parents' committees, children's reading protection committees, committees against immoral movies, and committees against militaristic education in schools, especially committees against all kinds of chauvinism and racial hatred.

    国际保卫儿童大会继续听取报告
    资本主义国家儿童生活状况恶化
    苏联人民民主国家妇婴卫生已获显著成就
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际保卫儿童大会在十二日下午继续举行会议，由印度代表周杜利担任主席。
    意大利议员裴罗蒂教授在会上作了“关于儿童健康问题”的报告。
    裴罗蒂说：人们对资本主义世界中大多数儿童的健康状况感到惊恐是有理由的。营养不良、恶劣的居住环境、穷困和令人不满的医务工作——这些都是资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国大批儿童患病和死亡的原因。在美洲和西欧各国，公共卫生、社会设施、文化事业和民用生产的经费不断削减，用以增加军费。例如，法国的军费占预算的百分之五十，而公共卫生的拨款只占百分之一。西方其他国家也差不多是同样的情形。这些国家实行战争准备的结果，造成了国内生活条件的恶化，并使人口繁殖不断降低。
    裴罗蒂进而叙述了苏联、各人民民主国家、中国、德意志民主共和国在公共卫生及对妇婴的照顾方面的显著成就，并强调说：我们必须把保护儿童健康及物质福利的工作，掌握在自己手里。因此，我们有义务为保卫和平、改善生活条件和反对扶摇直上的物价及捐税而坚决斗争。我们必须要求政府扩充儿童医药机关，保护青工，禁止雇用童工和贩卖儿童，设立孤儿院。
    英国保卫儿童委员会主席吉尔朋接着作了“关于儿童教育问题”的报告。吉尔朋指出：在世界人口中文盲占很大的百分比。许多资本主义国家的教育状况很坏，例如，美国全部儿童中只有四分之一受到极少的教育，有四百万学龄儿童根本没有受到教育。目前阻碍教育发展的一个主要因素，便是日益增加的庞大的军事开支和人力及物资被用到准备战争上面。例如，英国在两年内，军费差不多增加了一倍，而教育经费只增加了百分之十四。吉尔朋在叙述许多资本主义国家的学校建筑令人不满的情形时指出：苏联是解决学校建筑问题的一个榜样。尽管苏联在第二次世界大战中受到破坏，但在战后它的学校建筑已有了充分的发展。
    吉尔朋接着提出了若干建议，其中包括增加各国教育经费，在教育机关中实行补助金办法，改善教员物质条件，禁止体罚，用集体主义和尊敬其他民族的精神教育儿童等。吉尔朋最后指出：所有这一切只有在和平时期才是可能的。为了儿童的缘故，我们需要世界和平。
    柏林西部医生格罗斯克尔特在会上作了“关于文学、报纸、无线电、电影和艺术对于儿童的精神和文化发展的影响”的报告。她号召大家注意美国输送到世界各国的廉价读物和盗贼影片所造成的有害影响。她说：在美国“艺术品”的影响之下，少年犯罪的行为每年都在增加。美国法院每年审问二十七万五千名儿童的案件。日本少年罪犯在一九四五年为二万八千名，但到一九四八年就增加为七万五千名。格罗斯克尔特最后说：必须要求政府制订法律，保护儿童不受廉价读物、恶劣的无线电广播及电影的影响。大会应该号召父母、教师和医生们组织父母委员会，保护儿童读物委员会、反对不道德的电影的委员会、反对学校中的军国主义教育特别反对各种沙文主义和种族仇恨的委员会。
