Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Reverend Wang Zizhong, a preacher of the North China Congregational Church, addressed an open letter to the World Council of Churches, accusing American imperialists of germ warfare crimes. To my fellow colleagues of the World Council of Churches:

    It has been several years since we parted in the capital of the Netherlands in September 1948. I hope you are all well and that everything is going smoothly. You have probably recently heard the news of the American aggressors frantically conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. To investigate the details of the germ warfare conducted by the American aggressors, I joined the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialist Germ Warfare," composed of various people's organizations, medical circles, and scientific circles in our country, and conducted a detailed investigation in various parts of Northeast China and the front and rear of Korea in mid-March. Witnessing the various evidences of the American aggressors' germ warfare, just as the prophet Jeremiah said: "His word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot." I cannot but accuse the American government of its completely inhumane and un-Christian behavior in conducting germ warfare to Christians and all good people around the world.

    Since January 28, 1952, the American aggressors have been conducting germ warfare on a large scale in the front and rear of Korea. Regionally, insects were dropped by the US in 70 counties and cities in Korea, and in China, it included more than 70 counties and cities in the provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang in the Northeast, as well as the Qingdao area. In terms of quantity, from January 28 to the end of March, germs were dropped in Korea as many as 804 times.

    On the Korean battlefield, I personally saw the shells of germ bombs dropped by American military aircraft, and saw the germ-carrying insects spread by the aircraft, such as mosquitoes, snow fleas, flies, spiders, as well as poisonous substances such as dead fish, dead rats, and chicken feathers. These insects are often a mixture of several obviously different types of insects. This is by no means a natural phenomenon, but only a man-made result. On April 2nd, in a small ditch in central Korea, I and several friends from the investigation team personally saw stone flies and leaves, etc., dropped by American planes that had not yet landed. These leaves and insects also fell on my friend Professor Wei Xi. After precise testing, it has been found that the insects and animals spread by the US aircraft carry pathogens such as cholera, plague, dysentery, and typhoid fever. On April 7, I heard the painful accusations of the families of the victims in Pyongyang. The person's name is Han Zhushou, 36 years old, living in Nanmenli, Zhong District, Pyongyang. His father, Han Xianggou, was 68 years old. On March 5, he contracted cholera when he caught flies scattered in the yard by American aircraft and died on the morning of March 8. At the same time, his two grandsons were infected, and the two grandsons also died of cholera on the night of March 8. There have been no cases of cholera in the area under the jurisdiction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea since 1947. The Korean elder Han Xianggou suddenly contracted cholera in a rather cold season, and he contracted it after catching flies scattered by American aircraft. There is no doubt that germ warfare harmed Han Xianggou and his grandsons. Not only that, Korea has never had the plague. In the past 30 years, there have never been reports of the plague in Korea in medical literature. The US Navy's report on epidemics in Korea affirmed that there was no plague in Korea. However, the American aggressors actually sent their air force to spread rats and fleas carrying plague germs in Korea many times, attempting to artificially cause the plague to poison the Korean people. Is this something that every conscientious and upright Christian cannot tolerate?

    Perhaps you may say that the American government would not resort to such a low tactic. If you face the facts, you will immediately break your original prejudice. I believe that you will also, like me, based on the conscience of a Christian, have to admit the conclusion that the American government is conducting germ warfare.

    The US has been preparing and planning for germ warfare for a long time. They began studying germ warfare as early as 1941. Merck, chairman of the US Biological Warfare Committee, published a very detailed report on January 4, 1946. In 1946, MacArthur selected 18 Japanese germ warfare criminals to serve in US germ factories in Maryland, Mississippi, and Utah. On April 13, 1951, the New York Times reported that a germ research station was established in Japan, and MacArthur and his successor Ridgway actively encouraged Japanese germ warfare criminals to continue researching and producing germs. On December 5 of the same year, a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Rangoon: Two unnamed American officials revealed that Ridgway had sent Japanese germ warfare criminals, former Japanese Army Medical Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, whom he had raised, to Korea to carry out germ warfare.

    I am willing, based on the conscience of a Christian, to dare to testify before Christ that the American government has conducted and is conducting germ warfare.

    I would like to draw your serious attention to the fact that germ warfare not only threatens the Chinese and Korean people, but also threatens the people of the world. If the United States' evil deeds in Korea succeed, perhaps one day germ warfare may spread to Europe or other parts of the world. The American aggressors' germ warfare is not only an attack on the Chinese and Korean people, but also an attack on human justice, and an attack on human security and peace. Let all good Christians in the world take active action to safeguard human security and justice, condemn the American aggressors for their crimes of germ warfare, and impose effective sanctions on this criminal behavior. Otherwise, we as Christians will violate the true teachings of Christ, as Jesus Christ said: "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot." We will fail the good people of the world. We must fight against evil, we must fulfill our due responsibilities to the good people, so that justice is upheld and human security is guaranteed. I hereby extend my best regards.

    Respectfully, Wang Zizhong

    王梓仲牧师写信给世界基督教联合会
    控诉美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十三日讯】华北基督教公理会布道牧师王梓仲致世界基督教联合会控诉美帝国主义细菌战罪行的一封公开信。世界基督教联合会诸位同道大鉴：
    自从一九四八年九月在荷兰首都分别之后，已数年于兹，想诸君起居康宁，诸事顺遂也。诸君近来想已听到美国侵略者在朝鲜与中国东北等地疯狂进行细菌战的消息。为了察看美国侵略者进行细菌战的详细情况，我参加了我国各人民团体、医学界和科学界所组成的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，于三月中旬到我国东北各地并朝鲜前线和后方作了详尽的调查。目睹美国侵略者进行细菌战的种种罪证，正如先知耶利米所说：“我心里觉得有烧着的火，闭塞在我骨中，我就含忍不住。”我不能不向全世界的基督徒和一切善良的人们，控诉美国政府进行细菌战的完全违反人道，违反基督教义的行为。
    自一九五二年一月二十八日起，美国侵略者便在朝鲜的前线和后方大规模地进行细菌战，以地区而论，在朝鲜撒下昆虫的地区有七十郡、市之阔，在中国则包括东北辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江等省的七十余县市及青岛附近地区；以数量而论，自一月二十八日起截至三月底止，只在朝鲜投掷细菌就有八百零四次之多。
    在朝鲜战地，我亲眼看见美国军用飞机投下的细菌弹的弹壳，并看见飞机撒布的带有病菌的昆虫，如蚊子、雪蚤、苍蝇、蜘蛛等，还有死鱼、死鼠、鸡毛等毒物。这些昆虫，常是几种显然不同类的昆虫混集在一起，这决不是自然界自然出生的现象，只能是人为的结果。在四月二日那天，在朝鲜中部某个小沟里，我和调查团的几个朋友们，便亲眼看见美国飞机撒下的、仍未着地的石蝇和树叶等。这些树叶与昆虫还落在我的朋友魏曦教授身上。经过精密的检验，已查出美机撒布下来的昆虫、动物中带有霍乱、鼠疫、痢疾、伤寒等病原菌。四月七日，我在平壤市听到被害者家属的沉痛控诉。此人姓韩名洙演，年三十六岁，住平壤市中区南门里。他父亲名韩相国，年六十八岁，三月五日那天，捕捉美机散落在院中的苍蝇时，得了霍乱病，于三月八日早晨死去；同时又传染了他的两个孙子，两个孙子亦于三月八日夜间因霍乱病死去。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国辖区内，一九四七年以后就无霍乱病的发生，朝鲜老人韩相国突然在相当寒冷的季节里得了霍乱病，而又是在捕捉美机所撒之苍蝇后而得，毫无疑问是细菌战残害了韩相国和他的孙子。还不止此，朝鲜一向是没有鼠疫的，近三十年来在医学界的文献中亦从来没有关于朝鲜发生鼠疫的报告，美国海军部关于朝鲜流行病的报告中曾肯定地说朝鲜没有鼠疫。而美国侵略者竟派遣它的空军在朝鲜多次撒布带有鼠疫病菌的老鼠与跳蚤，企图用人工手段引起鼠疫的流行来毒害朝鲜的老百姓。这是每个有良心的正直基督徒所不能忍受的罢？
    诸君也许说美国政府不致出此下策。诸君若面对事实就会马上打破原来的成见。我相信诸君也会和我一样，凭着一个基督徒的良心，不得不承认美国政府进行细菌战的结论。
    美国进行细菌战是早有准备、有计划的。他们早在一九四一年就开始研究细菌战，美国生物作战委员会主席墨尔克在一九四六年一月四日发表了很详细的报告。一九四六年麦克阿瑟曾经选派了十八个日本细菌战犯到美国马利兰州、密士失必州、犹他州等细菌工厂去服务。一九五一年四月十三日纽约时报报道在日本设立了细菌研究站，麦克阿瑟和他的继任者李奇微，都积极地鼓励着日本细菌战犯继续研究和生产细菌。同年十二月五日，电通社仰光消息：有两位不愿意透露姓名的美国官员透露，李奇微已经把他所豢养的日本细菌战犯前日本陆军军医中将石井四郎、兽医少将若松次郎和北野政藏，派遣到了朝鲜进行细菌战的工作。
    我愿本着基督徒的良心，敢在基督面前见证美国政府已经进行和正在进行着细菌战争。
    我愿提起诸君的严重注意，细菌战不但威胁了中朝人民，也威胁着全世界的人民。如果，美国在朝鲜的罪恶行为得逞，说不定那一天细菌战也许会扩展到欧洲或世界的其他地方。美国侵略者进行细菌战不但是向中朝人民进攻，同时也向人类正义进攻，向人类的安全与和平进攻。全世界善良的基督徒们积极地行动起来吧，为维护人类的安全与正义，谴责美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，并对这一犯罪行为作有效的制裁。否则，我们作基督徒的便违背了基督的真道，如耶稣基督说：“你们是世上的盐，盐若失了味，怎能叫它再咸呢！以后无用，不过丢在外面被人践踏了。”辜负了全世界良善的人民。我们要与罪恶作斗争，我们要对良善人民尽到应尽的责任，使正义伸张，使人类安全得到保障。特此即候道安    教末王梓仲启
    一九五二年四月二十一日
