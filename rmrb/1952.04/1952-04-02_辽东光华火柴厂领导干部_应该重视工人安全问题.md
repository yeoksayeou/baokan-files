	Leading Cadres of Liaodong Guanghua Match Factory
	Should Pay Attention to Worker Safety

	To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Liaodong Provincial Guanghua Match Factory disregard worker safety. During the "Three-Anti" movement, two personal injury accidents occurred in succession. On February 8th, Liu Qingnian, a worker in the phosphorus dipping workshop, had his right arm severed by the belt of the screen-feeding machine. The main reason for this accident was the poor safety equipment of the machine; the belt was not covered with wood. Leading cadres did not conduct safety education for employees, resulting in workers violating technical operating procedures. This accident did not attract the attention of leading cadres. They did not investigate the cause, nor did they improve safety equipment or strengthen safety education. As a result, the second accident followed. On March 21st, Qu Huanzhang, an old worker in the phosphorus dipping workshop, had four fingers of his right hand severed by the gears of the continuous machine. The reasons for this accident, in addition to poor safety equipment and insufficient education, were mainly that leading cadres (especially the leading cadres of the technical inspection section) neglected rationalization proposals. In January and February, workers had made more than ten suggestions to the leadership, requesting improvements to the safety equipment of the continuous machine. According to the factory's conditions, these improvements could have been made; however, the leading cadres did not solve these problems in a timely manner. It was not until March that some improvements were made. This accident occurred on those gears that were not equipped with safety devices. The serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres has prevented workers' safety from being properly protected. They should conduct a profound self-criticism and take effective measures to ensure that no more accidents occur.

    辽东光华火柴厂领导干部
    应该重视工人安全问题
    编辑同志：辽东省营光华火柴厂领导干部漠视工人安全，在“三反”运动中连续发生两次人身事故。二月八日，沾磷车间工人刘庆年被筛梗机皮带绞断右臂。发生这个事故的主要原因，是机器安全设备不好，皮带没有用木板包上；领导干部没有向职工进行保安教育，以致工人违反技术操作规程。这一事故仍没有引起领导干部的注意。他们没有追查原因，也不改善安全设备，加强安全教育。于是，第二次事故接着又来了。三月二十一日，沾磷车间老工友曲焕章右手的四个手指被连续机的牙轮绞断了。这次事故的原因，除安全设备不好和教育不够外，更主要的是领导干部（特别是技术检查科的领导干部）轻视合理化建议。在一、二月间，工人就曾向领导方面提了十多次建议，要求改善连续机的安全设备。按该厂的条件，是可以改善的；但是领导干部却没有及时解决这些问题。直到三月间，才改进了一部分。这次事故就出在那些没有安全装备的牙轮上。领导干部的严重的官僚主义作风，使工人的安全得不到应有的保障。他们应作深刻的检讨，并采取有效的办法保证不再发生事故。
