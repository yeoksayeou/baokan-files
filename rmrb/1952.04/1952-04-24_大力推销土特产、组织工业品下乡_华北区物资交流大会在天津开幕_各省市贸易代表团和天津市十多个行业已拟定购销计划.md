Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 23rd: The North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference, convened to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in North China, opened in Tianjin on the 23rd. Nearly two thousand people attended, including trade delegations from Hebei, Chahar, Beijing, and other provinces and cities, and representatives from industrial and commercial trade associations in Tianjin.

Li Zheren, Director of the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, delivered the opening speech. In explaining the significance and tasks of the conference, he pointed out the favorable situation of trade at present: First, the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has removed the "three evils" and "five poisons," clearing the obstacles on the road of economic construction; Second, industrial and agricultural production in North China is booming, and industrial and agricultural productivity is continuously improving, with relatively abundant industrial and agricultural products to meet the needs of the people; Third, the purchasing power of the people in North China has increased, and this year the purchasing power per capita will increase by about 27 percent compared with 1951; especially after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, prices have generally fallen across the country, which has provided favorable conditions for the sales of industrial and agricultural products. Li Zheren affirmed that the entire economic future is one of development and prosperity.

Li Zheren then emphasized that the central tasks of the conference are: to vigorously promote local specialties; to organize industrial products (mainly daily necessities) to the countryside; to review old contracts and sign new contracts. In order to successfully complete this task, he criticized the erroneous thinking of some trade units that only sell but do not buy, and only buy popular goods but not unpopular goods. He called on all trade units to adopt an honest and trustworthy transaction attitude and the transaction principles of having both buying and selling, buying more and selling more, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit, to sign contracts and agreements, and to vigorously organize transactions.

Subsequently, Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economic Committee, Liu Gongran, Deputy Director of the Conference Committee, Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and heads of trade delegations from various regions spoke. In his speech, Zhu Jisheng called on Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen to eliminate the "five poisons" and actively participate in the conference with a genuine and fairly priced trading attitude.

The exchange conference is divided into: 1. A Contract Review Committee, which reviews the execution of contracts signed by various trade units in 1951, urges units that have not yet executed contracts to do so as soon as possible, and assists trade units whose circumstances have changed and cannot execute contracts to re-establish contracts. 2. A Native Products Department, which has four groups: native industrial raw materials, medicinal materials, mountain dried goods, and sundry goods; 3. A General Merchandise Department, which has three groups: daily necessities, electrical equipment, and gauze; 4. A Livestock and Oil Department, which has two groups: livestock products, oils and oilseeds; 5. A Service Department, composed of nine units including the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Tianjin Trust Company, the Railway Bureau, and the North China Joint Transport Company.

The trade delegations that have arrived in Tianjin and more than ten industries in Tianjin, such as department stores, mountain dried and fresh goods, and oil businesses, have all drafted purchase and sales plans. The conference will start trading on the 24th and is tentatively scheduled for one month. If necessary, it may be extended as appropriate.

    大力推销土特产、组织工业品下乡
    华北区物资交流大会在天津开幕
    各省市贸易代表团和天津市十多个行业已拟定购销计划
    【新华社天津二十三日电】为了活跃华北城乡物资交流而召开的华北区物资交流大会已在二十三日在天津开幕。到会的有河北、察哈尔、北京等省、市贸易代表团和天津市工商业同业公会代表近两千人。
    大会由华北行政委员会贸易局局长李哲人致开幕词。他在说明这次大会的意义和任务时，指出了目前贸易的有利情况：一、“三反”、“五反”运动的伟大胜利，去掉了“三害”、“五毒”，扫清了经济建设道路上的障碍；二、华北工农业生产蓬勃发展，工农业生产力不断提高，有比较丰富的工农业产品供应人民需要；三、华北区人民购买力提高，今年每人的购买力将比一九五一年提高约百分之二十七；特别是经过“三反”、“五反”运动，全国各地物价普遍下降，这就给工农业产品的销路提供了有利的条件。李哲人肯定地指出整个经济前途是发展的和繁荣的。
    李哲人继而着重指出这次大会的中心任务是：大力推销土特产；组织工业品（主要是日用百货）下乡；检查旧合同，签订新合同。为了胜利完成这个任务，他批判了目前部分贸易单位所存在的只卖不买，只买热货不买冷货的错误思想，号召各贸易单位应本老老实实，言而有信的交易态度和有买有卖、多买多卖、互助两利的交易原则，签订合同协议，大力组织成交。
    继由天津市财政经济委员会副主任李耕涛、大会副主任委员刘公然、天津市工商业联合会副主委朱继圣及各地代表团团长讲话。朱继圣在讲话中号召天津市工商业者，不要再有“五毒”，要以货真价实的交易态度，积极参加大会交易。
    交流大会分设：一、合同检查委员会，检查各贸易单位一九五一年所签订的合同的执行情况，督促未曾执行合同的单位早日执行，同时协助情况改变不能执行的贸易单位重新订立合同。二、土产部，下设土产工业原料、药材、山干货、杂货四组；三、百货部，下设日用百货、电工器材、纱布三组；四、畜产油料部，下设畜产、油脂油料两组；五、服务部，由中国人民银行天津分行、天津市信托公司、铁路局、华北区联运公司等九个单位组成。
    已到天津的各贸易代表团和天津市百货、山干鲜货、油商业等十多个行业都已拟定购销计划。大会自二十四日起进行交易，会期暂定一月，如有必要，可酌情延长。
