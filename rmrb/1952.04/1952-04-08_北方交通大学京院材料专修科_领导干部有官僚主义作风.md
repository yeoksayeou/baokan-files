    Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Institute Materials Specialization Course:
    Leading Cadres Exhibit Bureaucratic Work Style
    The leading cadres of the Beijing Institute of Northern Jiaotong University have a serious bureaucratic work style. The Materials Specialization Course was established by Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Institute on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, but this course has never had a concrete plan. Although the admissions brochure stated that the purpose of opening the Materials Specialization Course was to train talents in material identification, testing, and management, the course has changed its work direction and tasks three times in the past year. At the beginning of the course, students raised opinions to Han Zhongxiu, Director of the Education Department of the Ministry of Railways, and Wang Renjie, Head of the Education Section, regarding reforming the curriculum because it was too cumbersome and impractical, but they consistently failed to address these concerns. For example, the first semester required studying Highway Transportation, but because a professor could not be found, it was changed to Railway Transportation. Half a year later, Han Zhongxiu had to admit that this course was useless. What is even more intolerable is that, in order to "stabilize" the so-called "emotions of the students," Zhu Fuyan, a technician from the Ministry of Railways, actually said in a report: "Your future work is something you couldn't even ask for in the past, it is a golden rice bowl." Similarly, in order to "stabilize the emotions of the students," students were asked to go to Dalian for fun during last year's summer internship; in reality, nothing was learned in Dalian for a month, wasting 20 million yuan for nothing. During this "Three-Anti" movement, the students unanimously demanded that the leadership make a profound self-criticism; but not only did they not recognize their past mistakes, they also refused to meet with the students. Recently, again in order to "stabilize the emotions of the students," groups (management group and identification group) were hurriedly decided upon before the start of the semester. However, this grouping still does not proceed from actual needs. At the same time, whether the current curriculum is practical is also questionable. We request that relevant parties resolve these issues, and we hope that Han Zhongxiu and Wang Renjie make a profound self-criticism.　Zhang Hongkui

### 北方交通大学京院材料专修科  领导干部有官僚主义作风

    北方交通大学京院材料专修科
    领导干部有官僚主义作风
    北方交通大学京院的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。材料专修科是交通部委托北方交通大学京院开办的，但该科从来没有具体计划。虽然招生简章中说明开材料专修科的目的是培养材料鉴别、化验及管理人才，但过去一年中，该科却三次更改工作的方向和任务。最初开课时同学们就因课程过于繁琐、不切实用，向交通部教育处长韩钟秀及教育科长王人杰提过改革课程的意见，但他们始终不予解决。如第一学期规定读公路运输学，因为请不到教授而改读铁路运输学，半年后韩钟秀才不得不承认这门功课是没用的。更不能容忍的是，为了“安定”所谓“同学们的情绪”，交通部技师朱复炎在一次报告中竟说：“你们将来的工作是过去求也求不到的，是金饭碗。”同样是为了“安定同学们的情绪”，去年暑期实习时，要同学们到大连去玩玩；其实在大连一个月，根本没学到什么，白白浪费了二千万元。这次“三反”运动中，同学们一致要求领导方面作深刻的检讨；但他们不但不认识过去的错误，并拒绝接见同学们。最近，又是为了“安定同学们的情绪”，在开学前临时匆匆决定分组（管理组与鉴别组）。但这次分组仍不是从实际需要出发。同时，目前的课程是否切合实际也成问题。我们要求有关方面解决这些问题，并希望韩钟秀、王人杰二人作深刻检讨。　张宏奎
