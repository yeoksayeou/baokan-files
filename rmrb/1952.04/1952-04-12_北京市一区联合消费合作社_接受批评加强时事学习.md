To the People's Daily Editorial Department:

The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on March 29th criticized the phenomenon that most of the staff of our cooperative neglect reading newspapers and studying. We believe that this criticism is correct, and we thank the readers for their help.

As the newspaper pointed out, the phenomenon that our staff neglects reading newspapers is very serious. We have not tried to improve this situation for a long time, which shows that our leadership has not deeply realized the importance of strengthening staff reading and study.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, we have made a review at the meetings of the heads of various distribution outlets, and decided that we must strengthen the leadership of reading newspapers in the future. Now, the main and non-staple food supply stations and department store outlets of our cooperative have begun to establish reading groups, and take out one hour a day to read newspapers. Other distribution outlets will also generally establish reading groups.

    接受批评加强时事学习
    编辑同志：三月二十九日，人民日报“读者来信”栏批评我社大部分工作人员忽视读报学习的现象。我们认为这一批评是正确的，我们感谢读者的帮助。
    正如报纸所指出的，我社工作人员忽视读报的现象是很严重的。对于这种情况，我们长期没有设法改进，这说明我们领导方面还没有深刻地认识到加强工作人员读报学习的重要意义。
    为了克服这个缺点，我们已在各分销处负责人会议上作了检查，并且决定今后一定加强对阅读报纸的领导。现在，本社主副食供应站及百货门市部已开始建立读报组，每日抽出一小时的时间来阅读报纸。其他各分销处亦将普遍地建立读报组。
