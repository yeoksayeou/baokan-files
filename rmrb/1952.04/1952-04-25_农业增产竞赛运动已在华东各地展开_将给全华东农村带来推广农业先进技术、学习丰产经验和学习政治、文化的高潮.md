Agricultural Patriotic Increase Production Competition Launched in East China

Will bring a surge of advanced agricultural technology promotion, rich harvest experience learning, and political and cultural study in East China's rural areas

The agricultural patriotic increase production competition has been widely launched in East China. Many state-owned farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers in various regions are participating in the national competition. They have also launched competitions locally, thus rapidly unfolding a mass increase production competition movement in various places. As of now, hundreds of state-owned farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in the region have directly participated in the national competition.

The first state-owned farms to respond and participate in the national competition include the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute Farm, Shandong Boxing County Farm, Subei Gaoyou County Rice Experiment Farm, Sunan Lianhu Farm, Wanbei Anqing Special District Farm, Zhejiang Seed Company Xianghu Farm, and Fujian Minhou County Farm, totaling over a dozen farms. More than ninety agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams from Shandong, Subei, Sunan, Wanbei, Wannan, Zhejiang, and the suburbs of Shanghai and Nanjing are participating in the national increase production competition. These include the famous Shandong's Song Zongguo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and Zhang Fugui's mutual aid team, Subei's Zhao Fuya Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and Yang Qinggui's mutual aid team, Sunan's Liu Tianyou mutual aid team, Wanbei's Lü Dongyang mutual aid team, and Wannan's Li Youan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. Some of these cooperative mutual aid organizations are participating in a comprehensive increase production competition, while others are participating in increase production competitions for rice, cotton, and wheat. Shandong Province, where the movement is progressing faster, has seen eight more state-owned farms and thirty-two agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams follow suit after two state-owned farms and twenty agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, including Zhang Fugui's, responded and challenged the province. In addition, some labor models in Shandong have launched increase production competitions for crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. The initiators of the corn increase production competition are the province's famous corn high-yield models, Yang Fengcheng mutual aid team and Xu Detang mutual aid team, while the initiator of the sweet potato increase production competition is the sweet potato high-yield expert Wang Benshui's mutual aid team. They have respectively proposed competition conditions of producing 1,500 jin of corn or 15,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu of high-yield land. The Subei area is launching a "Ten Thousand Teams, Thousand Villages Patriotic High-Yield Competition Movement." The increase production plans set by various competition units generally require an increase of 20% to 30% compared to last year.

The development of the patriotic increase production competition will bring a surge of advanced agricultural technology promotion, rich harvest experience learning, and political and cultural study in East China's rural areas. Almost all state-owned farms participating in the patriotic increase production competition have listed the promotion of agricultural technology and specific guidance for farmers' production as competition conditions. Shandong Wendeng County Farm, Penglai County Farm, Ningyang County Farm, and Deping County Farm, among others, are preparing to open farmer training classes and train 10,000 to 20,000 farmers each this year. The increase production competition plans of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have also generally proposed conditions for strengthening technical learning and studying rich harvest experiences. The increase production plan of Shandong Lü Hongbin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative stipulates that the cooperative will establish one technician who will liaise with the county farm at the upper level and combine with the village technical team at the lower level to provide timely technical guidance for the entire cooperative's production. Local publications suitable for farmers, such as "Rural Mass" newspaper, "Agricultural Knowledge," and "Yishui Rural Newspaper," have been universally listed as required reading materials for everyone in the competition movement.

In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of this patriotic increase production competition, the East China Military and Political Committee, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and the party and government leadership organs of other provinces and regions have issued instructions respectively, instructing cadres at all levels to ensure layer-by-layer mobilization, level-by-level responsibility, meticulous organization, and specific guidance; and it is necessary to achieve planned, inspected, summarized, and completed execution throughout the year.

    农业增产竞赛运动已在华东各地展开
    将给全华东农村带来推广农业先进技术、学习丰产经验和学习政治、文化的高潮
    农业爱国增产竞赛运动已在华东各地普遍展开。各地国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民参加全国竞赛的很多。他们并在当地发起竞赛，因此，各地迅速展开群众性的增产竞赛运动。截至目前为止，全区各地直接参加全国竞赛的国营农场，农业生产合作社和互助组，已达数百个单位。
    首起应战参加全国竞赛的国营农场，有华东农业科学研究所农场、山东博兴县农场、苏北高邮县稻作试验场、苏南练湖农场、皖北安庆专区农场、浙江种子公司湘湖农场和福建闽侯县农场等十几个农场。参加全国增产竞赛的合作互助组织有山东、苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江及上海和南京郊区等地的九十多个农业生产合作社和互助组。其中包括著名的山东的宋宗国农业生产合作社和张富贵等互助组，苏北的赵甫亚农业生产合作社和杨庆桂互助组，苏南的刘天有互助组，皖北的吕东扬互助组和皖南的李有安农业生产合作社。这些合作互助组织有的参加全面增产竞赛，有的参加水稻、棉花、小麦的增产竞赛。运动开展较快的山东省，在两个国营农场和张富贵等二十个农业生产合作社、互助组应战并向本省挑战后，现在又有八个国营农场和三十二个农业生产合作社和互助组继起应战。此外，山东并有
    一些劳动模范，在本省发起了玉米、地瓜（甘薯）等作物的增产竞赛。发动玉米增产竞赛的是该省著名的玉米丰产模范杨逢成互助组和许德堂互助组，发动地瓜增产竞赛的是该省的地瓜丰产能手王本水所领导的互助组。他们分别提出了每亩丰产地产玉米一千五百斤或地瓜一万五千斤的竞赛条件。苏北区正在开展一个“万组千村爱国丰产竞赛运动”。各竞赛单位所订增产计划普遍要求比去年增产二成到三成。
    爱国增产竞赛运动的发展，将给全华东农村带来推广农业先进技术、学习丰产经验和学习政治、文化的高潮。几乎所有参加爱国增产竞赛运动的国营农场，都已将推广农业技术和具体指导农民生产列为竞赛条件。山东文登县农场、蓬莱县农场、宁阳县农场和德平县农场等，都准备开办农民训练班，在今年各训练农民一万到两万人。各地农业生产合作社和互助组的增产竞赛计划中，也普遍提出加强技术学习，研究丰产经验的条件。山东吕鸿宾农业生产合作社的增产计划中规定，社内设技术员一人，上与县农场联系，下与村技术小组结合，及时在技术上指导全社的生产。各地适合于农民的读物如“农村大众”报、“农业知识”、“沂水农村报”等，已普遍被列为竞赛运动中每人必须经常阅读的刊物。
    为了加强对于这次爱国增产竞赛运动的组织和领导，华东军政委员会、山东省人民政府以及其他省、区的党政领导机关，已分别发出指示，责成各级干部必须做到层层发动，按级负责，细致组织，具体指导；并且必须做到有计划，有检查，有总结，有始有终，贯彻全年。    （新华社）
