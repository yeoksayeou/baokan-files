Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Soviet people are grandly commemorating the 500th anniversary of the birth of the great Italian artist and scientist da Vinci. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: Commemorative meetings were held in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and other cities on the 15th. The Moscow commemorative meeting was held in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.

The meeting was presided over by Johanson, Chairman of the Soviet da Vinci Birth Centennial Commemoration Committee and Soviet People's Artist.

Through these activities, he strived to liberate mankind from the superstitions, rigidity, and ignorance of the Roman Church, to serve reality, and to explain the laws of nature through scientific methods. Da Vinci was a comrade-in-arms of progressive humanity in the struggle for peace and a beautiful and noble life. At the meeting, Dr. of Art History Albatov, President of the Soviet Academy of Architecture Moldvinov, and People's Artist Gerasimov respectively reported on da Vinci's contributions to various aspects of human culture.
