    Northeast Bureau Holds "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Study Session
    Comrade Gao Gang Presided Over the Discussion and Decided to Establish a Regular Study System
    The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" study session on the 18th, to discuss Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding philosophical work, "On Contradiction." The study session was presided over by Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and attended by members of the Northeast Bureau and leading cadres of various departments. Those present unanimously agreed that in this militant philosophical document, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the rich experience of the Chinese revolution, developed Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's theories on materialist dialectics, especially deeply and thoroughly explaining the universality and particularity of contradiction and their interrelationship, and severely criticizing the errors of dogmatism and empiricism's subjective, one-sided, and superficial methods of thinking. This has extremely significant guiding significance for the current great revolutionary struggle and ideological remolding movement. Therefore, earnestly studying "On Contradiction" and Comrade Mao Zedong's other works is a decisive issue for the entire Party, especially senior leading cadres, in improving their work level and leadership level.
    The discussion lasted four hours, with most of the time spent discussing the contradictions in the current stage of the Chinese revolutionary movement, the relationship between internal and external causes of revolutionary success or failure, the issue of ideological struggle within the Party, the contradictions within state-owned enterprises and in the rural areas of Northeast China, and the specific manifestations of class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in various aspects. Most members of the Northeast Bureau and leading cadres of various departments expressed their opinions, and the discussion was extremely enthusiastic. Gao Gang used many practical materials and theoretical bases to conduct vivid and specific analyses of some of the issues raised at the meeting.
    In order to make the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works a regular system, Gao Gang was appointed as the leader of the Northeast Bureau's "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" study group, and it was decided to hold a study and discussion meeting once every two weeks. Before each discussion, all comrades participating in the meeting must be fully prepared and relate it to the problems in the current revolutionary struggle and work. The next discussion will further delve into "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Finally, Lin Feng and other members of the Northeast Bureau proposed that each member of the Northeast Bureau should organize study groups for "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the departments they lead, which was immediately unanimously approved by the comrades present.

    东北局召开“毛泽东选集”学习会
    高岗同志主持讨论并决定建立经常学习制度
    中共中央东北局在十八日召开了“毛泽东选集”学习会，讨论毛泽东同志杰出的哲学著作“矛盾论”。学习会由中共中央东北局书记高岗主持，参加讨论的有东北局各委员与各部负责干部。到会者一致认为毛泽东同志在这一战斗的哲学文献中，根据中国革命的丰富的经验，发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于唯物辩证法的学说，尤其是深入而周密地说明了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性及其相互联系问题，严厉地批判了教条主义和经验主义的主观、片面与表面的思想方法的错误，这对于当前的伟大革命斗争与思想改造运动，有着极其巨大的指导意义。因此认真学习“矛盾论”和毛泽东同志的其他著作，对于全党特别是高级领导干部来说，是提高工作水平和领导水平的决定性的问题。
    讨论会历时四小时，大部分的时间讨论了现阶段中国革命运动中的矛盾问题，革命成败的内部原因与外部原因的关系问题、党内思想斗争的问题、目前国营企业内部以及东北农村中的矛盾问题、阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在各个方面的具体表现问题。多数东北局委员和各部负责干部都发表了意见，讨论极为热烈。高岗曾用许多实际材料和理论上的根据，就会上提出的某些问题，进行了生动具体的分析。
    为使学习毛泽东同志的著作成为经常制度，由高岗任东北局“毛泽东选集”学习组长，并决定每两星期召开学习讨论会一次，讨论前每个参加会议的同志都须充分准备，并联系当前革命斗争和工作中的问题。下一次讨论会，拟进一步就“实践论”与“矛盾论”进行深入讨论。最后，东北局委员林枫等并提议每个东北局委员对自己领导的部门都要组织“毛泽东选集”的学习小组，当即得到到会同志的一致赞成。（新华社）
