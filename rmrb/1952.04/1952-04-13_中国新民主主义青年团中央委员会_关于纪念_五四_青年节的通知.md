Rural youth should actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement, participate in and promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and learn and promote advanced agricultural production methods and cultural and scientific knowledge. In areas with insufficient rainfall and poor water conservancy, they should actively participate in drought prevention and resistance.

    3. Students should participate in the ideological remolding movement; they should study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hard, draw a clear ideological line with the bourgeoisie, and establish a world outlook of serving the working people; they should study culture and technology hard, exercise their physique, and prepare to dedicate themselves to the various constructions of new China. Graduating students from various middle schools should also actively prepare for further education, so as to ensure admission to universities and specialized schools, learn specialized knowledge and skills, and better serve the great construction of the motherland.

    Young people throughout the country should inherit and carry forward the glorious patriotic tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, be infinitely loyal to the great motherland, understand that their production, learning, and work are all for defending and building the motherland, and completely combine their own interests with the interests of the motherland and the people. Young people throughout the country should also strengthen their internationalist cultivation and learn from the heroic models of selfless fighting and working of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front.

    Youth League committees and other youth organizations in various localities should commemorate this year's "May Fourth" in accordance with the above spirit. Generally, mass rallies to commemorate "May Fourth" should not be held separately.

    【新华社十二日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在四月十一日发出“关于纪念‘五四’青年节的通知”，全文如下：
    “五四”青年节同时又是青年团成立三周年纪念日即将到来。今年，在“三反”和“五反”运动胜利的条件下来纪念“五四”，是有重大的意义的。广大青年在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动中提高了革命觉悟，增强了热爱祖国、爱护国家财物、为保卫与建设祖国而斗争的意志。今年纪念“五四”，我们应当在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，满怀信心，向着新中国的光明前途迈进。为了更好地参加我们祖国的伟大建设事业，青年们应当做好下列几件事情：
    一、青年们要积极参加抗美援朝的斗争：支援中国人民志愿军，反对美帝国主义的细菌战，学习和广泛地宣传防疫卫生知识；并且积极锻炼自己，随时响应祖国的号召，参加国防建设；并以此作为中国青年最光荣的任务。
    二、青年们要积极参加增产节约运动：国营工厂青年工人要以自觉的劳动态度，参加爱国生产竞赛，学习生产技术，节省原料，爱护机器和工厂设备。私营工厂和商店中的青年工人、店员，在“五反”运动未结束的地区，应当继续积极参加斗争；在“五反”运动已告胜利的地区，应当和成年工人、店员在一起推动资本家遵守共同纲领，进行合法生产和经营，防止资本家进行“五毒”等非法行为。农村青年要积极参加爱国增产运动，参加和推广互助合作运动，学习和推广先进的农业生产方法和文化科学知识，在雨水不足和水利不好的地区要积极参加防旱抗旱运动。
    三、学生们要参加思想改造运动；要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，和资产阶级划清思想界限，树立为劳动人民服务的人生观；要努力学习文化和技术，锻炼体格，准备献身于新中国的各项建设。各个中学毕业学生并要积极作升学的准备，以便保证升入大学和专科学校，学习专门学识和技能，更好地为祖国的伟大建设事业服务。
    全国青年都应继承和发扬“五四”的光荣的爱国主义传统，要无限忠诚于伟大的祖国，要了解自己所进行的生产、学习和工作，都是为了保卫祖国和建设祖国，要把自己的利益与祖国和人民的利益完全结合起来。全国青年并应加强国际主义的修养，学习中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线忘我战斗和工作的英雄模范。
    各地团委和其他青年团体应根据上述精神纪念今年的“五四”，一般不单独举行纪念“五四”的群众大会，应发动青年积极参加各地举行的“五一”纪念大会，在“五四”可分别举行青年群众的座谈会、晚会、讲演、游园会等。
    青年团中央为了以生动的范例教育广大青年和青年团员，决定在今年“五四”青年节颁发第一批奖励全国优秀团员的奖状。
