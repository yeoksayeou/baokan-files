    Letting Tens of Millions of Mu of Fertile Land Escape Waterlogging Disaster
    ——Introduction to the Huai River Midstream Tributary Diversion Project
    In the middle reaches of the Huai River, from Wuhe County to the shores of Hongze Lake, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are digging a new river channel. This is equivalent to declaring war on the perennial waterlogging disasters in the Su County area, and it is determined to forever eliminate the waterlogging that farmers in the Su County area fear most.
    During the flood season every year, the low-lying areas on both banks of the Huai River tributaries in the Su County area almost all become lakes. When the flood is at its highest, from Mohekou, west of Linhuai Pass, to Fengshan in the east, a 50-kilometer stretch of land has about two million mu of farmland submerged underwater. The Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers also constantly overflow, inundating crops.
    Why does this happen? This is because the floodwaters of the Huai River tributaries have no outlet.
    The people of northern Anhui have a saying: "Standing on Fushan looking at Wuhe, Huai, Hui, Chong, Tong, Tuo." This means that if you stand on Fushan and look towards Wuhe, you will see the Hui River, Chong River, Tong River, and Tuo River all converging in the same county and joining the main stream of the Huai River. The main stream of the Huai River below Wuhe has been affected by the stagnation of Hongze Lake for hundreds of years, resulting in excessively high water levels. Therefore, every summer and autumn, the floodwaters rushing down from the mountains in the upper reaches of the Huai River, along with the floodwaters of the tributaries in the middle reaches, not only cannot be smoothly discharged by the main stream of the Huai River after converging but also frequently cause backflow. In this way, the floodwaters of the Huai River tributaries have no way out and overflow everywhere, and the nearly ripe crops in the vast fields of the Su County area are all swallowed up by the flood.
    In the Huai River harnessing project, although it is planned to widely construct reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River, use natural lakes and low-lying areas to intercept and store floodwaters, and comprehensively regulate the main and tributary river channels, the flood level of the Huai River in the Wuhe area is still higher than the water levels of the tributaries. In this way, the floodwaters of the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers cannot be discharged from the main stream of the Huai River and will still cause serious waterlogging disasters in the Su County area. In order to solve this problem, the Huai River Harnessing Committee has decided to open a new river channel between Wuhe County and Hongze Lake, so that the floodwaters of the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers can flow directly into Hongze Lake through the new river channel. After this diversion project is completed, it can reduce the flood level of each tributary from 18.5 meters to 16.5 meters, which can rescue two million mu of farmland in the Su County area that is frequently affected by waterlogging from the bottom of the water. At the same time, with an outlet for the internal water on both banks of the Huai River main stream and tributaries, the cultivated area can be expanded. Therefore, after the Huai River main stream and tributaries are separated, it is estimated that about ten million mu of farmland will directly and indirectly benefit.
    After the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers, the Huai River tributaries, are separated from the Huai River main stream, the Hui River and Tuo River will first converge with the Chong River and Tong River, and then enter the Yao River through Fengshan, and then enter the Li River through Xiacaowan, and flow straight into Hongze Lake. The Fengshan and Xiacaowan diversion canal sections both need to pass through mountains and hills, and the project is extremely difficult. Among them, the Fengshan cutting ridge project, the height of the mountains and hills is generally 15 meters, with the highest being 35 meters. The excavation depth is deepest at 26 meters, with an average of 17 meters. In addition, the river channels of the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers need to be reorganized or new river channels need to be opened, and the mouths of each river entering the Huai River must be blocked. The total earthwork of the entire project is 17.62 million cubic meters. This project started construction last winter and was temporarily suspended in the middle, and now it has started again. An army of 200,000 laborers is successively coming from Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Sixian, Xuyi, Jiashan, Lingbi and other counties. They are full of confidence in overcoming the struggle against nature. Their battle slogan is: "Let tens of millions of mu of fertile land escape waterlogging disaster!" (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Minsheng)

    让千万亩良田免除内涝灾害
    ——淮河中游干支流分流工程介绍
    淮河中游，从五河县到洪泽湖畔，数十万民工正在开挖一条新河道。这就等于向宿县专区连年的内涝灾害宣了战，一定要永远消灭宿县专区农民最怕的内涝。
    每年洪水期间，宿县专区境内淮河干支流两岸洼地几乎全成了湖泊。洪水最大时，西起临淮关以西的沫河口，东到峰山，全长五十公里的地段内，约有二百万亩田禾沉没在水底。浍、漴、潼、沱各河也不断泛滥，淹没农作物。
    为什么会发生这种情况呢？这是因为淮河支流的洪水没有出路的缘故。
    皖北老百姓有这样一句话：“站在浮山望五河，淮、浍、漴、潼、沱。”这就是说，你站在浮山上，向五河望去，你会看见浍河、漴河、潼河和沱河都汇聚在同一县境内和淮河干流汇合。五河以下的淮河干流，几百年来受洪泽湖停潴的影响，水位过高，因此每年夏秋两季，从淮河上游崇山峻岭间奔腾而来的洪水，和中游各支流的洪水汇集后，不但不能由淮河干流顺畅地泄出，且经常发生倒灌。这样，淮河各支流的洪水更找不到出路，就到处漫溢成灾，宿县专区广阔田野里即将成熟的庄稼，就全被洪水吞噬了。
    根治淮河工程中，虽然计划在淮河上中游广泛地建筑水库，利用天然的湖泊洼地拦蓄洪水，和普遍整理干支流河道，但五河一带淮河的洪水位仍比各支流的水位高。这样，浍、漴、潼、沱等支流的洪水仍无法从淮河干流排泄，仍旧会使宿县专区发生严重的内涝灾害。为了解决这个问题，治淮委员会决定在五河县到洪泽湖之间，另辟新河道，使浍、漴、潼、沱等支流的洪水，直接由新河道流入洪泽湖。这个分流工程完成以后，能把各支流的洪水位由十八点五公尺降低到十六点五公尺，就可以将宿县专区经常发生内涝的二百万亩农田从水底救出来。同时，淮河干支流两岸内水有了出路，可以扩大耕地面积。因此，淮河干支流分开后，直接和间接受益的农田，估计将有一千万亩左右。
    浍、漴、潼、沱等淮河支流与淮河干流分开后，浍河、沱河先跟漴河、潼河汇流，然后经过峰山入窑河，再经下草湾入溧河，直泻洪泽湖。峰山和下草湾两段引河，都需经过山岭和岗地，工程异常艰巨。其中峰山切岭工程，山岭和岗地的高度，一般为十五公尺，最高的有三十五公尺。开挖深度，最深的有二十六公尺，平均为十七公尺。此外，浍、漴、潼、沱各河的河道需要重加整理或是辟新河道，各河汇入淮河的口门又须堵断。全部工程的土工共达一千七百六十二万公方。这个工程去年冬季就已开始施工，中间曾暂停，现在又已开工了。二十万人组成的劳动大军，正陆续从怀远、五河、泗县、盱眙、嘉山、灵璧等县开来，他们充满着战胜大自然斗争的信心，他们的战斗口号是：“让千万亩良田免除内涝灾害！”（新华社记者于民生）
