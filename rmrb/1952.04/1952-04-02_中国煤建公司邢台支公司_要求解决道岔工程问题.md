China Coal Construction Company, Xingtai Branch
Requests Resolution of Railroad Switch Engineering Problems

To the Editor:
	On March 14th, the People's Daily published a letter from the Shijiazhuang Branch of the China Grain Company, requesting relevant departments to inspect and repair railroad switch engineering. Our company has the same concerns. In the first half of last year, our company, with the approval of higher authorities, began constructing a dedicated railroad switch line. In October, the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau telegraphed its approval for the construction. Our company then allocated 1.002 billion yuan in engineering fees to the Railway Bureau, accounting for approximately 64% of the total engineering costs. The Xingtai Engineering Section, under the jurisdiction of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau, commenced work in late October, initially constructing the roadbed and culverts along the route. Our company simultaneously proceeded with capital construction, renting factory premises and building new offices, investing a total of over 600 million yuan. However, in December of last year, the project abruptly halted, and the Railway Bureau did not provide any explanation. Upon inquiry, they stated, "The suspension of work is based on instructions from higher authorities, and construction can only be decided upon after review and approval by higher authorities." Subsequent negotiations yielded no results. We also sent letters to local financial and economic departments, requesting inquiries to the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Railways, but received no response. Due to the lack of a dedicated railroad switch, all the construction we have completed cannot be utilized effectively. We are now forced to continue transporting goods by manual carts. This method of transportation results in annual losses of over 3 billion yuan compared to train transport. Our company's allocation tasks for this year are substantial, and the construction of a dedicated railroad switch line is an urgent problem that needs to be resolved. We request the relevant departments to promptly inspect and resolve this issue.

### 中国煤建公司邢台支公司  要求解决道岔工程问题

    中国煤建公司邢台支公司
    要求解决道岔工程问题
    编辑同志：三月十四日，人民日报刊载了中国粮食公司石家庄分公司的一封来信，要求有关部门检查修理道岔工程，我公司也有同样的意见。我公司在去年上半年经上级批准修建铁路道岔专用线，十月，石家庄铁路分局来电报准予修建。我公司即拨给路局工程费十亿零二千万元，约占全部工程费的百分之六十四。石家庄铁路分局所属邢台工务段在十月下旬开工，先建筑路基及途中涵洞。我公司随着也就进行基本建设，租赁厂地，新建办公室等共投资六亿多元。但到了去年十二月份，工程突然停顿，路局也不说明理由。经我们询问，他们说：“停工系奉上级指示，待上级审查合格才能决定施工与否。”以后再交涉仍无结果。我们又函请当地财经部门向贸易部、铁道部询问，仍无回讯。因没有专用道岔，我们已建妥的一切建设就不能发挥应有作用。现在我们不得不仍用人力车搬运货物。用这种搬运方式，每年比用火车运要损失三十多亿元。我公司今年的调拨任务庞大，修建道岔专用线是目前急待解决的一个大问题。我们要求有关部门迅速检查、解决这一问题。
