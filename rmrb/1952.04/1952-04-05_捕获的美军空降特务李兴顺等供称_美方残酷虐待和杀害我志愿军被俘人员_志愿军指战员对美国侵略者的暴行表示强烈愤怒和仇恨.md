Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 4th: The U.S. aggressors cruelly abused and murdered captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel on Geoje Island. According to confessions from U.S. airborne special agent Li Xingshun and others recently captured by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island were stained with blood under the brutal rule of the U.S. military, and the 72nd prisoner-of-war camp, where captured Volunteer Army personnel were imprisoned, was called "hell on earth." Before being sent to the prisoner-of-war camps, our captured personnel were subjected to severe interrogation by the enemy, and all personal belongings such as pens and watches were confiscated, and their clothes were replaced with tattered clothes from the U.S. aggressors. Due to prolonged starvation and freezing and constant beatings, many became ill, and the sick received no medical treatment. The U.S. aggressors not only physically tortured our captured personnel, but also sent a group of Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to the prisoner-of-war camps to act as so-called "instructors," forcing them to carry out reactionary political education that slandered our Volunteer Army. Those who refused were beaten, and the words "Oppose Communism and Resist Russia" were forcibly tattooed on the backs of our captured personnel. The U.S. aggressors used special agent activities in the prisoner-of-war camps, and used the pretexts of "resistance" and "riots" to arrest, beat, and massacre people at every turn. For example, Zhao Zuorui, a captured member of our side imprisoned in the 72nd prisoner-of-war camp, and Guo Zhaolin, imprisoned in the 86th prisoner-of-war camp, were both kidnapped by the enemy to Busan and other places, and their whereabouts are unknown, and their lives are uncertain. Before the two massacres of our captured personnel by the U.S. aggressors on February 18th and March 13th this year, they had repeatedly carried out massacres in the prisoner-of-war camps.

U.S. airborne special agent Li Xingshun confessed that on October 10th of last year, Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents sent to the 86th prisoner-of-war camp to act as so-called "instructors" colluded with the U.S. bandits to forcibly raise the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flag." When this shameless act was opposed by our captured personnel, the enemy troops opened fire on our captured personnel, killing and wounding more than 80 people on the spot.

One U.S. airborne special agent confessed: After our captured personnel arrived at the prisoner-of-war camp, they were only given half a bowl of rice per meal. Anyone who was dissatisfied due to hunger was branded as a "Communist element" or "riot element" by the enemy, and those who were lightly punished were beaten one by one with wooden sticks, and those who were severely punished were executed. On one occasion, more than 20 of our captured personnel in the 72nd prisoner-of-war camp were shot and killed or wounded by enemy troops because of the meal problem.

Another U.S. airborne special agent captured by us confessed that he had personally murdered and buried two of our captured personnel in the 72nd prisoner-of-war camp. He said that in a certain place in the western part of Geoje Island, there were more than 400 of our captured personnel who had been brutally murdered buried, and the graves all had the words "China's pow" (Chinese prisoners of war) on them.

This inhuman and brutal behavior of the U.S. aggressors has aroused strong anger and hatred among the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】美国侵略者在巨济岛残酷地虐待和杀害我志愿军被俘人员。据最近被中国人民志愿军某部捕获的美军空降特务李兴顺等供述：巨济岛各俘虏营在美军残暴统治下血迹斑斑，囚禁志愿军被俘人员的第七十二号俘虏营等都被呼作“人间地狱”。我方被俘人员在被送入俘虏营前，均经敌军严刑审讯，个人私有物资和钢笔、表等全被没收，衣服也都被换上美国侵略者破烂不堪的衣服。由于长期受饿受冻并常遭受毒打，病倒者甚多，病人都得不到医疗。美国侵略者不但从肉体上摧残我被俘人员，而且派了一批蒋匪特务分子到俘虏营中充当所谓“教官”，强迫进行诬蔑我志愿军的反动政治教育，不愿前往者即遭殴打，并强迫在我被俘人员背上针刺“反共抗俄”字样。美国侵略者在俘虏营中利用特务活动，动辄以“反抗”、“暴动”等罪名，进行逮捕、毒打与屠杀。如囚禁在七十二号俘虏营中的我被俘人员赵佐瑞和在八十六号俘虏营中的郭照霖等，先后都被敌方绑送到釜山等地，迄无下落，生死不明。美国侵略者在今年二月十八日、三月十三日两次屠杀我被俘人员之前，曾经屡次在俘虏营中进行屠杀。
    美军空降特务李兴顺供称：去年十月十日，派到第八十六号俘虏营中充当所谓“教官”的蒋匪特务分子，勾结美国强盗，强升蒋匪“国旗”，当此无耻行为遭我被俘人员反对时，敌军即向我被俘人员开枪，当场伤亡八十余人。
    一个美军空降特务供称：我被俘人员到俘虏营后，每顿只给吃半碗饭，凡因饥饿而不满者，敌军便以“共产党分子”或“暴动分子”论罪，轻者以木棒逐一毒打，重者处死。七十二号俘虏营中的我被俘人员，有一次即因吃饭问题遭敌军开枪打死、打伤二十余名。
    另一个被我捕获的美军空降特务供认：他曾亲自在七十二号俘虏营中杀害、掩埋过两个我方被俘人员。他说，在巨济岛西部某地即埋有惨遭杀害的我方被俘人员四百余名，坟上均有China’s　pow（中国的俘虏）字样。
    美国侵略者此种丧失人性的残暴行为，引起了中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员的强烈愤怒和仇恨。朝鲜谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
