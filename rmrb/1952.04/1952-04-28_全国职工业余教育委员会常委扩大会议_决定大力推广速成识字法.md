This matter will be specifically discussed and handled by the Central People's Government Ministry of Education and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. (2) Currently, focus on Beijing and Tianjin to select several factories and schools for vigorous promotion and experimentation (starting in mid-May). At the same time, formulate a city-wide plan for promoting the rapid literacy method and eliminating illiteracy, and summarize existing experience to report to the whole country. (3) The issue of supplying teaching materials and popular reading materials will be resolved step by step by the Central People's Government Ministry of Education and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in consultation with relevant parties. (4) It is recommended that news agencies, newspapers, and magazines vigorously publicize and report on the experimental situation of the rapid literacy method. It is recommended that the General Political Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Film Bureau and the Social and Cultural Affairs Administration of the Central People's Government Ministry of Culture shoot films and slides of the rapid literacy method teaching process for promotion throughout the country. (5) Another meeting of the National Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee will be held in mid-May.
