Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd—The All-China Democratic Women's Federation telegraphed Japanese workers and women on April 23rd, expressing support for their heroic struggle to win national independence and democratic rights. The telegram is as follows:

Dear Japanese workers, both men and women:

The reactionary Yoshida government, under the direction of the American occupation authorities, is attempting to formulate a fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" in order to suppress the Japanese people's movement to win national independence and democratic rights. This bill seeks to completely deprive the Japanese people of their fundamental democratic rights, turn Japan into a base for American imperialist aggression, and make the Japanese people docile cannon fodder for the American imperialists, forever becoming slaves of American imperialism.

The heroic Japanese workers, both men and women, have launched a large-scale nationwide strike movement. This heroic struggle is a powerful response to the conspiracies of the imperialists and their running dogs, and therefore makes a significant contribution to safeguarding world peace, especially peace in Asia. Your struggle has won the deep sympathy of all Chinese women and people, as well as hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. We sincerely congratulate you on your victory in the great struggle for national independence and democratic rights.

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd—The All-China Democratic Women's Federation telegraphed Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on April 23rd, protesting the Japanese government's attempt to deprive the Japanese people of their democratic rights through the reactionary "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The telegram is as follows:

To Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida:

Disregarding the resolute protests of the Japanese people, the Japanese government is attempting to enact the reactionary "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," completely depriving the Japanese people of their democratic rights and turning Japan completely into a base for American imperialist aggression. This proves that the Japanese government is openly violating the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. Therefore, Chinese women hereby lodge a serious protest.

    我全国妇联声援日本工人和妇女的斗争
    抗议吉田政府制定剥夺日本人民民主权利的反动法案
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于四月二十三日致电日本的工人和妇女，声援他们为争取民族独立和民主权利而进行的英勇斗争。电文如下：亲爱的日本男女工人和妇女们：
    吉田反动政府在美国占领当局指使下，为了镇压日本人民争取民族独立和民主权利的运动，企图制定法西斯化的“防止破坏活动法案”。这一法案是要完全剥夺日本人民的基本的民主权利，是要使日本变成美帝国主义进行侵略战争的基地，是要使日本人民温驯地去充当美帝国主义者的炮灰，永远成为美帝国主义的奴隶。
    英勇的日本男女工人已经发起了全国规模的声势浩大的罢工运动，这种英勇斗争有力地回答了帝国主义者及其走狗的阴谋，因而对于保卫世界和平、特别是亚洲的和平，是有重大贡献的。你们的斗争受到全中国妇女和人民、以及全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的深切同情，我们衷心祝贺你们在争取民族独立和民主权利的伟大斗争中获得胜利。

    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于四月二十三日致电日本首相吉田茂，抗议日本政府企图用反动的“防止破坏活动法案”剥夺日本人民的民主权利。电文如下：日本吉田茂首相：
    日本政府不顾日本人民的坚决抗议，竟企图制定反动的“防止破坏活动法案”，完全剥夺日本人民的民主权利，使日本完全变为美帝国主义进行侵略战争的基地，这证明日本政府公然违背了波茨坦宣言的规定。为此，中国妇女特提出严重的抗议。
