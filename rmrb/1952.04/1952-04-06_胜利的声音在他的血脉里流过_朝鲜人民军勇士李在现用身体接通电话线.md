    The Sound of Victory Flowed Through His Veins
    ——Korean People's Army Warrior Li Zaixian Uses His Body to Connect Telephone Line
    In fierce battles, ensuring command communication for the troops is one of the most important and difficult tasks. Sometimes, a single kilometer of wire can be broken dozens, even hundreds, of times a day by artillery fire. To reconnect these broken wires, signalmen have to climb into the most concentrated enemy fire to work. Telephone lines are shattered into pieces and set ablaze. At most, a kilometer and a half of spare wire was used in a single kilometer of terrain in one day.
    In mid-September 1951, a certain unit of the Korean People's Army fought a beautiful defensive battle in a certain place. When the battle for Height 854.1 unfolded fiercely, Li Zaixian, the deputy squad leader and a labor party member of Zhao Jin-yu's company, along with soldiers Zha Fengkun, Jin Guangjing, and Park Zhiyu, carried switchboards and spare wire, undertaking the task of communication with the Jin Fengsong detachment. The enemy fired more than 10,000 artillery shells at Height 854.1 every day. Li Zaixian's squad had to connect broken lines at least fifty or sixty times a day under artillery fire. When soldier Jin Guangjing was wounded while connecting a line, Li Zaixian quickly took over his work.
    At 2:00 PM on the 17th, when Li Zaixian was connecting a line, artillery shells landed on both sides of him. He was thrown off the ground and onto the hillside by the blast. He desperately grabbed a small tree to avoid rolling down the hillside. His uniform was on fire, and his face was covered in mud, revealing only his eyes. A shrapnel hit his hand. Li Zaixian bravely pulled out the shrapnel from his hand, and blood was flowing, but he seemed unaware of the pain. He only remembered that the telephone line had not yet been connected. He took out the spare wire and quickly went to work. When the spare wire ran out, he picked up all the broken wires on the ground and connected them, but it was still short by about the length of two arms. What to do? The command communication of the troops could not be delayed for even a minute! At this moment, he remembered the deeds of a signalman from a certain unit published in the unit's publication, who had used his own body to connect the wires: "That's right, I'll use my body to connect the telephone line too." He bit one end of the wire in his mouth and, enduring the pain, inserted the other end into the wound on his hand.
    Just then, the telephone rang. The electric current shook his whole body, like thousands of red-hot steel needles piercing him. Li Zaixian endured the pain and barely picked up the receiver, hearing the voices of the unit commander and the detachment leader talking. The unit commander issued an order to resolutely annihilate the enemy. The sound of victory flowed through his veins, but Comrade Li Zaixian passed out. At this time, the soldiers of the Jin Fengsong detachment were launching an assault under the wise command of the unit commander.
    An hour later, soldier Park Fengkun, who was checking the telephone lines, found Li Zaixian and, after two hours, managed to wake him up. His noble spirit of sacrifice and patriotism completed the communication task of the troops, enabling the troops to annihilate almost an entire division of the Li pseudo-army's 8th Division in the defensive battle of Height 854.1, eliminating 7,949 enemy soldiers.
    Heroic Comrade Li Zaixian had participated in the Volunteer Army in South Korea and also participated in the Decheon and Fuping-ri battles. His heroic actions earned him the Military Service Medal and the National Flag Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    胜利的声音在他的血脉里流过
    ——朝鲜人民军勇士李在现用身体接通电话线
    在激烈的战斗中，保障部队的指挥通讯是最重要、最艰难的任务之一。有时候，一根一公里长的电线，一天之内会被炮火打断几十次甚至几百次。为了重新连接起这些折断了的电线，电讯员们要爬到敌人炮火最集中的地方去工作。电话线被打得一段一段着了火，在一公里地段上，一天所消耗的预备线，最多的曾达到一公里半长。
    一九五一年九月中旬，朝鲜人民军某部在某地打了一场漂亮的防御战。当八五四点一高地的战斗猛烈展开的时候，赵进禹中队的副小队长、劳动党员李在现和战士札峰昆、金光景、朴致玉，携带着交换机和预备线，担任和金峰松区分队通讯联系的任务。敌人每天向八五四点一高地发射一万多发炮弹，李在现小队每天至少要在炮火下连接断线五六十次。战士金光景在接线中负伤了，李在现就很快地接替了他的工作。
    十七日下午二时，李在现在接线的时候，他的两旁各落了一颗炮弹，他被震得离开地掀到山坡上，他使劲抱住一颗小树，才没有滚到山坡下去。他的军服着了火，泥土扑满了他的脸，只露出两只眼睛。一块弹片打伤了他的手。李在现勇敢地拔出手上的弹片，鲜血在流着，可是他似乎不知道痛，他只记着电话线还没有接通。他取出预备线迅速地工作着。预备线用完了，他拣起地上的所有断线接上，结果还差两臂长的一段。怎么办呢？部队的通讯指挥是一分钟也不能耽误的啊！这时候，他想起了部队刊物上发表过的某部电讯员以自己的身体接通电线的事迹：“对了，我也用身体接电话线。”他把电线的一头咬在口里，把另一头，忍着痛，插进手上的伤口。
    正在这时候，电话机转动了，电流震动了他的全身，像千万根烧红的钢针在身上扎。李在现忍受着痛苦，勉强拿起听筒，听到了部队长和区分队长通话的声音。部队长下达了坚决消灭敌人的命令。胜利的声音在他的血脉里流过，可是李在现同志昏过去了。这时金峰松区分队的战士们正在部队长的英明指挥下进行突击。
    一小时后，检查电话线的战士朴峰昆发现了李在现，经过两个钟头才把他救醒过来。他这种高贵的牺牲精神和爱国热情，完成了部队的通讯任务，使部队在八五四点一高地的防御战中，歼灭了李伪军第八师差不多一个整师，消灭敌人七千九百四十九名。
    英雄的李在现同志，曾在南朝鲜参加义勇军，也参加了德川战斗和富平里战斗，他的英勇行为获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军功勋章和国旗勋章。
