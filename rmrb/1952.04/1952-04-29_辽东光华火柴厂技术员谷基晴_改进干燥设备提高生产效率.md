    Liaodong Guanghua Match Factory Technician Gu Jiqing
    Improves Drying Equipment, Increasing Production Efficiency
    Editor: Gu Jiqing, a technician at the Liaodong Provincial Guanghua Match Factory, has improved the drying equipment, creating a new record of drying 15,000 jin of matchstick blanks per day. Since July of last year, the matchstick blank workshop's drying room has been drying 6,500 jin of matchstick blanks per day, which could not keep up with production needs. Increasing the efficiency of the dryer was a very urgent task. Gu Jiqing, a technician from the ironworking department, and other workers received a great education in the "Three-Anti" campaign, and their class consciousness was raised. They began to study the problem of improving the drying equipment. They added a blower next to the drying furnace and enlarged the one-foot exhaust fan tube to increase the number of revolutions and the wind force. But this experiment failed; the matchstick blanks coming out of the dryer were not dry. They did not lose heart and continued to study. They replaced the blower with a larger one to increase the heat. The second experiment still did not work well, and the matchstick blanks were scorched. That day was February 12th, and the situation was very urgent. If the drying equipment could not be improved, the entire factory would have to stop work on the third day. Gu Jiqing thought to himself, "Can I watch the country suffer losses because of this? I must improve it." That night, he was constantly thinking of ways. On February 13th, he conducted the third modification, installing openable and closable latches on both the blower and the exhaust fan. This research was successful. This method improved the blowing capacity, increased the heat, solved the difficulty of controlling the speed of feeding the matchstick blanks, and mastered the appropriate temperature, finally enabling the daily drying amount of matchstick blanks to reach 15,000 jin.

    辽东光华火柴厂技术员谷基晴
    改进干燥设备提高生产效率
    编辑同志：辽东省营光华火柴厂技术员谷基晴改进干燥设备，创造了每日干燥一万五千斤梗子的新纪录。去年七月以来，梗片车间干燥机室每日干燥梗子六千五百斤，供应不上生产的需要。提高干燥机的效率是一个很迫切的任务。铁工部技术员谷基晴和其他工人，在“三反”斗争中受到了很大的教育，阶级觉悟提高了，他们开始研究改进干燥设备的问题。他们在干燥炉旁边增加了一台吹风机，把一尺的抽风机筒子改大一些，以增加回转数和风力。但这次试验失败了，从干燥机里出来的梗子并不干。他们没有泄气，继续研究。他们把吹风机换了一个大的，以增加热量。第二次试验结果仍不好，梗子都被烤着了。那天是二月十二日，情况很紧急，如果干燥设备再不能改进，第三天全厂就得停工。谷基晴心想：“我能眼看国家因此遭受损失吗？我一定要改好它。”当天晚上，他一直在想办法。二月十三日，他进行第三次改修，把吹风机和抽风机各安了一个能开闭的插销。这次研究成功了。这个方法提高了吹风能力，增加了热量，解决了送梗快慢的困难，掌握了适当的温度，终于使每天干燥梗子量达到一万五千斤。    王天祥
