    "The Birth of a New City" Shines with the Vision of New China's Construction

    To the Editor: After reading the article "The Birth of a New City" published in the People's Daily, I felt boundless excitement and elation. I believe that this is indeed a good piece of communication; every sentence and every word of it shines with the happiness of the people of New China today and the glorious and brilliant future of the motherland.

    In this article, we see that four years ago, Yichun was still a desolate and uninhabited area. However, in these short four years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the working people have created miracles. Yichun has become a city with a population of over 12,000, equipped with modern facilities. What is most exciting is that Yichun is still under continuous construction. The Forestry Specialized School is about to be established, and a large number of construction cadres for the motherland will be trained from this higher education institution. Is this leap-forward progress something that local residents could have imagined four years ago? Is it also something that those enemies who vainly attempt to hinder our construction in various ways could have imagined?

    We are confident that soon, from the Northeast to the Southwest, from Xinjiang to Hainan Island, newly born cities like Yichun will emerge everywhere in New China. We hope that journalists will report more on this aspect for us in the future.

### “一座新城市的诞生”一文闪耀着新中国建设的远景

    “一座新城市的诞生”一文闪耀着新中国建设的远景
    编辑同志：我读了人民日报登载的“一座新城市的诞生”一文后，感到无限的激动和兴奋。我认为，这确是一篇好通讯；它的每一句话，每一个字都闪耀出今日新中国人民的幸福和祖国辉煌灿烂的远景。
    在这篇通讯中，我们看到四年前的伊春，还是一片渺无人烟的荒凉地区。然而，就在这短短的四年中，在毛主席、共产党的领导下，在苏联的友谊帮助下，劳动人民创造了奇迹，伊春竟成了一座拥有现代化设备的一万二千多人口的城市了。而最令人兴奋的，是伊春还正在不断建设中。森林专门学校即将创办了，大批祖国的建设干部将从这座高等学校中培养出来。这种飞跃的进展，岂是四年前当地居民所能想到的吗？也岂是那些妄想用种种方法阻滞我们建设的敌人们所曾想到的吗？
    我们确信，不久以后，从东北到西南，从新疆到海南岛，新中国到处都会涌现像伊春这样新生的城市。盼望新闻工作者，今后在这方面更多地为我们报道。    哲行
