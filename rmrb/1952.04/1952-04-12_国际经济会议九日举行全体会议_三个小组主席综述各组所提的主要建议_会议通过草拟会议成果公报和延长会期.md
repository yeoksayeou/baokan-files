Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: The International Economic Conference held a plenary session on the 9th, chaired by French representative M. Basti. The session was attended by business representatives, economists, engineers, trade union and cooperative leaders from 49 countries.

The chairmen of the conference's three working groups presented reports in turn, summarizing the exchanges of views within the groups, the conclusions of the discussions, and the main recommendations made by the representatives.

Lanqi (Poland), Chairman of the International Trade Working Group, said: "All speakers at the group meetings agreed that the current world trade is sluggish, and the trade volume is barely above the level of 1928. Considering the increase in population, the average per capita is even less than the level of 1928 in many countries. Most speakers believe that the difficulty in developing world trade is entirely due to the fact that some countries create artificial obstacles and implement discrimination everywhere out of non-economic considerations."

Lanqi continued: "After analyzing the current situation of international trade, the group meetings reached a most important conclusion, which is that the opportunities to increase the volume of international trade are still very broad. It is estimated that the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic, taken together, can increase their trade with capitalist countries by two and a half to three times in the next two or three years. Representatives from Western Europe, Asia, the Americas and other countries have also expressed their willingness to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union, China and Eastern European countries. In order to facilitate concrete discussions on the possibilities of trade, the meeting set up six groups according to the types of goods. After exchanging views, many parties have separately signed important transaction agreements, and many more agreements will be signed in the future." Lanqi said: "These achievements show that developing international trade, establishing new trade links, and restoring old trade links are not only theoretically possible, but also a concrete reality."

Lanqi then summarized the most important recommendations made by everyone at the group meetings. He said: "Some people proposed that the conference submit its conclusions and recommendations to the United Nations, and request the United Nations to take steps to promote and expand international trade links. Some people also hope that international economic conferences will continue to be held in the future; it would be best to establish an international committee to prepare for them, and if possible, engage in other activities to promote the development of international trade. Others suggested that international economic conferences should be held in the future to specifically discuss specific issues of a trade and economic nature."

French representative Lebrun reported on the work of the working group on promoting international economic cooperation to solve social problems. He also read out the following recommendations unanimously adopted by the working group:

　　In the current political and economic situation, business people should do their best to accelerate the exchange of materials, so as to eliminate social problems such as food shortages, unemployment, low purchasing power, housing shortages and diseases;
　　Governments of all countries should assist business and trade circles to strive to develop international commerce;
　　Governments of all countries should take joint actions through the specialized agencies of the United Nations to gradually eliminate all obstacles hindering international trade;
　　First of all, the United Nations General Assembly should be requested to convene a meeting as soon as possible with the participation of representatives from governments, business circles and social celebrities of all countries;
　　The working group's recommendations also pointed out that the current international tension is a major obstacle to the development of world trade, but on the other hand, the development of trade relations will help ease the tense international situation.

Jeanjean Chand (India), Chairman of the Working Group on Underdeveloped Areas, also reported on the work of the group. He pointed out that the current situation of underdeveloped countries is very bad, and the most important factors in their economies—natural resources, industry, banking, foreign trade, and shipping—are controlled by foreigners. This hinders the natural development of these countries' economies. The working group has formally announced its advocacy of eliminating trade discrimination and economic control of underdeveloped countries by powerful countries. The trade of these countries should first be organized in accordance with the interests of the people, and their trade should be linked to their economic and social needs. It is extremely important to ensure the economic independence of these countries.

Japanese Senator Tomi Kora and West German industrialist Krumm also spoke at the meeting. After describing the difficult situation of the Japanese people, Tomi Kora emphasized that if Japan were to establish trade relations with its neighbors—the Soviet Union, China, etc.—it would be very helpful to eliminate Japan's current economic difficulties. She hopes that Japan will have the opportunity to trade with its neighbors in the near future, and no longer have to purchase raw materials from distant countries and transport them from across the Pacific Ocean.

Krumm, on behalf of all the West German participants, stated that facts will prove that this meeting is valuable. The trade links established at this meeting should be expanded in the future.

After a short break, the meeting continued, chaired by Daftari of Iran.

Lanqi suggested at the meeting that the Presidium draft a draft proposal on the establishment of an International Trade Promotion Committee based on everyone's proposals, and draft a letter to the United Nations and a communiqué on the main results of the meeting. Lanqi said that in addition to general issues, the communiqué should state how many people participated in the meeting, representing how many countries, and more importantly, it should point out the friendly atmosphere during the discussions and summarize the reports of the various working groups of the meeting. At the same time, many delegations at this meeting have established trade links, and the final results in this regard should also be included in the communiqué. Lanqi's proposal was unanimously adopted by the whole audience.

The last speaker was Chamberland, the Secretary-General of the meeting. On behalf of the Presidium, he proposed extending the session to the 12th. This is because many business people participating in the meeting hope to have more time to contact representatives of Soviet economic organizations and delegations from other countries to continue the trade negotiations that began at the opening of the meeting. Another reason is that it takes time to prepare draft recommendations and to allow attendees to carefully study the reports of the working groups. Chamberland suggested expanding and strengthening the Liaison Committee, and suggested that all delegations establish contact with this committee as soon as possible. He said: Establishing trade links is a factor that contributes to the success of the meeting.

After adopting the proposal to extend the session, the meeting adjourned.

    国际经济会议九日举行全体会议
    三个小组主席综述各组所提的主要建议
    会议通过草拟会议成果公报和延长会期
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际经济会议在九日举行全体会议，由法国代表巴斯迪任主席。出席会议的有四十九个国家的工商界代表、经济学家、工程师、工会和合作社领袖。
    会议的三个工作小组的主席相继提出报告，综述小组内交换意见的情况，讨论的结论以及各代表所提出的主要建议。
    国际贸易工作小组主席兰基（波兰）说：小组会议上的所有的发言人都认为，目前世界贸易不振，贸易量勉强超过一九二八年的水平，如果考虑到人口的增加，用人口平均计算，那么许多国家甚至还不到一九二八年的水平。大多数发言人都认为，世界贸易之所以难于发展，完全是因为某些国家出于非经济性的考虑，而处处制造人为的障碍，处处实行歧视。
    兰基接着说：小组会议在分析了目前国际贸易的情况之后，得出了一个最重要的结论，就是：增加国际贸易量的机会仍然是很广泛的。大家估计，苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和德意志民主共和国合计在一起，可以在今后两三年内增加它们与资本主义国家的贸易到二倍半乃至三倍。西欧、亚洲、美洲和其他各国的代表也都表示他们愿意与苏联、中国和东欧各国发展贸易关系。为了便于就贸易的可能性进行具体的讨论，会议按照货物的种类设立了六个小组。各小组经过交换意见之后，已经有许多方面分头签订了重要的交易协定，今后将陆续会有许多协定签订。兰基说：这些成就表明，发展国际贸易、建立新的贸易联系、恢复旧的贸易联系，不仅在理论上是可能的，而且是具体的现实。
    兰基接着综述小组会议上大家提出的最重要的建议。他说：有人提议大会把它的结论和建议提交联合国，并请求联合国采取步骤，促进和扩展国际贸易联系，也有人希望今后还继续举行国际经济会议；最好还成立一个国际委员会来加以筹备，可能的话，更从事其他促进国际贸易发展的活动。还有人建议，今后应该举行专门讨论贸易性质和经济性质的具体问题的国际经济会议。
    法国代表勒布朗报告了促进国际经济合作解决社会问题工作小组的工作。他并宣读了工作小组所一致通过的下列建议：
    在现有的政治与经济情况下，工商界人士应竭尽所能加速物资交流，俾消灭粮荒、失业、购买力低下、房荒和疾病等社会问题；
    各国政府应协助工商界与贸易界努力发展国际商业；
    各国政府应通过联合国的专门机构采取联合行动，逐渐消除妨害国际贸易的一切障碍；
    首先，应该要求联合国大会尽早召开一个有各国政府、企业界和社会名流的代表参加的会议；
    工作小组的建议并指出：目前国际紧张局势对于世界贸易的发展是一个重大的障碍，但另一方面，贸易关系的发展将有助于缓和紧张的国际局势。
    落后地区问题工作小组主席杰安·昌德（印度）也报告了小组的工作。他指出：目前落后国家处境很不好，它们经济中最重要的因素——天然财富、工业、银行、对外贸易和航运，都操在外国人的手上。这就妨碍了这些国家的经济的自然发展。工作小组已经正式宣布，主张消除贸易歧视和强国对落后国家的经济控制。应该首先依照人民的利益组织这些国家的贸易，并把它们的贸易和它们的经济与社会需要联系起来。保障这些国家的经济独立是极其重要的。
    日本参议员高良富女士和西德实业家克鲁姆也在会上发言。高良富在叙述了日本人民的困难处境之后，强调指出：日本要是和它的邻国——苏联、中国等建立贸易关系，那将会非常有助于消除目前日本的经济困难。她希望日本在不久的将来能够有机会和它的邻国贸易，而不必再从遥远的国家购买原料，老远地从太平洋彼岸运过来。
    克鲁姆代表列会的全体西德人士表示，事实将会证明这次会议是有价值的。在这次会议上建立的贸易联系今后应当加以扩大。
    会议经片刻休息后接着举行，由伊朗代表达夫塔里任主席。
    兰基在会上建议由主席团根据大家的提议，就设立国际贸易促进委员会的问题草拟建议草案，和草拟致联合国书以及关于会议主要成果的公报。兰基说，这个公报里除了一般的问题之外，应该说明参加这次会议的有多少人，代表多少国家，更应指出大家在进行讨论时的友好气氛，并综述会议各工作小组的报告。同时，这次会议中已有许多代表团建立了贸易联系，这方面的最后结果也应该列入公报里面。兰基的建议获得了全场一致的通过。
    最后发言的是会议秘书长香贝朗。他代表主席团提议延长会期至十二日。因为许多参加会议的工商界人士希望能够有更多的时间，和苏联经济组织的代表及其他国家的代表团接触，以继续在会议开幕时就开始了的贸易谈判。另一个原因就是：需要时间来准备建议草案，并使到会者能够审慎研究工作小组的报告。香贝朗建议扩大和加强联络委员会，并建议一切代表团尽快和这个委员会建立联系。他说：建立贸易联系是促成会议成功的因素。
    会议在通过了延长会期的建议之后，即宣告休会。
