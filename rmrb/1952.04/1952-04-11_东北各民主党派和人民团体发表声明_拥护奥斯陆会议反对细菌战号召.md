Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th - Local organizations of various democratic parties in Northeast China and people's organizations in the Northeast region have issued statements endorsing the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" adopted by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at the Oslo meeting, and the "Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by the United States Army in Chinese Territory" issued by the Investigation Group of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

The joint statement of the Northeast Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, stated: We, the democratic party organizations in the Northeast, unanimously believe that the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" issued by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and the convincing, impartial investigation report issued by the Investigation Group of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers are in line with the humanitarian spirit of upright people. Based on scientific rigor and humanitarian responsibility, and based on definite scientific, factual, and legal grounds, they presented the testimonies and material evidence of the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors; these grounds, stained with crime and ironclad, can never be denied by American imperialism. We express our warm support for the above statement and investigation report. At the same time, with great anger, we wholeheartedly respond to the call in the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" issued by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council: "Bring those criminals who use the most despicable, filthy, and appalling weapons to justice as war criminals." We firmly believe that as long as the people of the whole country unite under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, work together, and unite with all peace-loving and just people in the world, the heinous bacteriological warfare manufactured single-handedly by American imperialism will surely be defeated by us.

The people's organizations in Northeast China that issued statements include the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Northeast Student Federation, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Northeast Association of Health Workers, and the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The statement of the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression stated: "The great call of the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council 'Against Bacteriological Warfare' fully represents the solemn fighting will of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. The crime of the insane American aggressors in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China has been confirmed by conclusive evidence. No sophistry or denial by the American aggressors can allow them to escape the just punishment of the people of the world. We must strengthen and deepen the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and strive to bring those war criminals to justice as soon as possible!" The statement of the Northeast Association of Health Workers stated: "We, the health workers of Northeast China, fully support the immediate establishment of an international commission to collect all the facts about American imperialism's bacteriological warfare, and we will do our best to provide all assistance and support to the work of this international commission."

    拥护奥斯陆会议反对细菌战号召
    【新华社沈阳十日电】各民主党派在东北的地方组织和东北区各人民团体发表声明，拥护世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书，和国际民主法律工作者协会调查团发表的“关于美国军队在中国领土上使用细菌武器的报告”。
    中国国民党革命委员会东北临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟东北总支部、中国民主建国会沈阳市分会筹备委员会的联合声明中说：我们在东北的各民主党派组织一致认为世界和平理事会执行局发表的
   “反对细菌战”告全世界男女书，和国际民主法律工作者协会调查团发表的使人信服的公正无私的调查报告，是符合正直人民的人道主义精神的。他们本着科学的严肃性和人道主义的责任心，并依据确切无疑的科学根据、事实根据和法律根据，提出了美国侵略者所造成的滔天罪行的人证、物证；这些罪迹斑斑、铁案如山的根据，美帝国主义是永远也抵赖不了的。我们对上述声明和调查报告表示热烈拥护。同时，我们怀着极大的愤怒心情，衷心响应世界和平理事会执行局告全世界男女书中所号召的：“把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。”我们完全相信：只要全国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的坚强领导下团结起来，一致努力，并和全世界爱好和平与正义的人们团结起来，美帝国主义所一手制造的万恶的细菌战必然能够被我们所战胜的。
    东北各人民团体发表声明的有中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会东北总分会、东北总工会、中国新民主主义青年团东北委员会、东北民主妇女联合会、东北学生联合会、东北文学艺术界联合会、东北卫生工作者协会、中苏友好协会东北总分会等。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会东北总分会的声明中说：“世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议所发出的‘反对细菌战’的伟大号召，完全代表了全世界爱好和平的亿万人民的庄严的战斗意志。丧心病狂的美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北撒布细菌的罪行，已经有了确凿的证据，美国侵略者任何诡辩和狡赖都不能使它们逃脱全世界人民的正义惩罚。我们一定要加强和深入抗美援朝斗争，争取早日使那些战争罪犯们归案法办！”东北卫生工作者协会的声明中说：“我们东北卫生工作者完全拥护迅速成立一个国际委员会，收集美帝国主义进行细菌战的一切事实，我们将尽力给予这个国际委员会的工作以一切帮助和支持。”
