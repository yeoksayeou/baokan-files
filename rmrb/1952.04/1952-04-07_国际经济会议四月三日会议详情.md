Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 4th: The International Economic Conference opened on April 3rd in the Column Hall of the Moscow Trade Union Building, attended by entrepreneurs, economists, engineers, trade union and cooperative leaders, and editors of economic magazines and newspapers. They came from forty-two countries including Austria, Argentina, the United Kingdom, China, Czechoslovakia, Brazil, France, the German Democratic Republic, India, Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Poland, the Soviet Union, West Germany, Sweden, and Finland. Some attendees are still en route to Moscow. Representatives of Soviet and foreign newspapers and many guests also attended the opening meeting.

    Secretary-General of the International Economic Conference Preparatory Committee,
    Chamberlain, Delivers Opening Speech
    Secretary-General Chamberlain of the Preparatory Committee of the International Economic Conference Initiating Committee delivered the opening speech on behalf of the Preparatory Committee at the first meeting. His speech was as follows: Ladies and gentlemen:
    The International Economic Conference Initiating Committee has asked me to welcome you here.
    On behalf of the Initiating Committee, I would like to express my gratitude to you for accepting the invitation, for taking time out of your important affairs to attend this conference, and for the long and arduous journey that many have undertaken.
    At the same time, I would like to express our deep gratitude to the Soviet Preparatory Committee and its chairman, Mr. Nesterov, Chairman of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce, for the perfect arrangements that enable us to work in the best conditions, for the warm hospitality of the Soviet hosts, and for the renowned Soviet tradition of hospitality. I am sure that I am expressing the wishes of all the attendees of the conference.
    Three hundred and thirty-nine attendees have already arrived in Moscow, along with seventy-nine experts from various delegations. Twenty-nine attendees have just arrived, and another fifty are still en route.
    The fact that so many people have gathered in this hall, and that more people will arrive soon, gives this conference great importance. This is the first time that so many entrepreneurs, economists, trade unionists, and cooperative representatives from countries with different economic systems have gathered together to study common problems.
    This is one of the goals of the Initiating Committee, and it is proud to have achieved this goal.
    Today, the world's attention is focused on the Moscow International Economic Conference, which is perfectly understandable. At a time when so many countries are suffering from serious economic difficulties, the Moscow Economic Conference has become a pressing need and a hope filled with possibilities.
    Only those who believe that dangerous competition between countries is the way to get rich will take a hostile and indifferent attitude towards proposals aimed at restoring economic relations between countries and improving the living conditions of all people.
    The Initiating Committee decided that the number of representatives attending this conference should be four hundred and fifty in order to ensure the greatest importance and effectiveness of the conference. If this number has been slightly exceeded, it is only to accommodate the increasing number of requests that the Initiating Committee has received, especially in the past few weeks. However, in any case, the Initiating Committee has always been fully aware of the need to maintain a fair balance between countries; the diversity and variety of the delegations that have come to Moscow prove that there has been no discrimination in the selection of representatives; the only principle followed in the selection of representatives is to make the conference as representative as possible of the economic interests of the various countries concerned.
    There have been many absurd comments about the nature of this conference, so it is not superfluous to trace the various stages of the conference's preparation.
    The idea of convening such a conference took concrete form more than a year ago. Under what circumstances did this idea take shape? At that time, entrepreneurs, economists, and trade union workers from several Western European countries held their first gathering in Paris. They were distressed by the economic difficulties suffered by their own countries; these difficulties were largely due to the shrinking geographical scope of their countries' trade and the one-sidedness of their countries' trade. This one-sidedness made it completely impossible for them to adjust their balance of payments. They were rightly distressed by this situation, which contained serious economic difficulties and the danger of crises in important economic sectors, so they asked themselves: Is the time ripe to try to restore normal economic relations with Eastern European countries? It is appropriate to restore normal economic relations with these Eastern European countries because of their rapid economic development and their stable markets.
    This is the origin of the motivation for convening an economic conference. The convening of an economic conference was prompted by economic necessity. The initial plan was indeed limited, but as a result of successive meetings and personal contacts, the scope expanded.
    This initiative was responded to by groups and movements aimed at promoting international understanding, and there is no point in hiding this fact. But in order to be true to history, it should be pointed out that in consultations with representatives of many economic sectors, it was recognized that the scope of the economic conference should be expanded and the number of participants should be increased, because it was initiated by an absolutely independent body that was not related to any movement or any organization or any government.
    The past and present purpose is to convene a conference attended by private individuals rather than government representatives. The main consideration is to promote economic cooperation between countries and to win over all those who wish to participate in this effort, without requiring them to agree to the goals or policies of any group or government.
    This is how the Initiating Committee was established.
    The Initiating Committee consists of economic figures from twenty-one countries who are not related to any movement or any government. Although the selfless efforts of the committee members have sometimes been subjected to unfair criticism, the committee has finally laid the foundation for this conference, which should be credited to it. As to whether this conference can be of historical importance, it now depends on our efforts.
    The Initiating Committee held its first meeting in Copenhagen last October, at which time it initially saw everyone's interest in the economic conference, and now the economic conference has aroused worldwide interest.
    I do not intend to report in detail on the work achievements of the Initiating Committee at its first meeting or thereafter. All I need to say is that thanks to the efforts of all the committee members, this conference has become a serious undertaking that can deal with the seriousness of the international economic situation. The communiqué issued by the Initiating Committee at that time, as well as the conclusions reached by the committee, were full of unwavering desire to do everything possible to restore international economic relations and promote the lofty cause of international cooperation. We all hope that there will be no more hostility between countries, but instead international cooperation.
    Why hold the meeting in Moscow? People often ask this. This is also an issue that needs to be explained. The initiators of the conference had no particular preference for any city. However, it is only possible to discuss economic relations between countries if representatives of all countries can come together. The committee had approached the governments of several neutral countries that the initiators believed might be suitable as meeting places, but difficulties immediately arose because the conditions proposed by these countries, if accepted, would have made it impossible to hold a real world conference. If we had agreed to hold the meeting in a neutral country without receiving guarantees that visas would be issued to representatives from China and the Soviet Union—to mention just these two countries—then our meeting would have become a meeting with a limited geographical scope and would have lost all practical value. The Soviet delegation proposed Moscow as the meeting place and provided the guarantees that are indispensable for holding such a meeting. The only hope of the Initiating Committee was to serve the cause of international economic cooperation and was willing to hold the meeting in any country that could guarantee to provide the same facilities as the Soviet Union, so who can blame the Initiating Committee for accepting this proposal?
    Today, many people think that choosing Moscow as the meeting place is a good thing. This place allows many of us to personally see economic realities that we did not fully understand before, and to estimate the huge possibilities that such a country offers to international trade. This country is a vast market, and at the same time its export potential is undeniable. We have said that the purpose of the Initiating Committee is to convene a solemn economic conference at which economists, entrepreneurs, trade unionists, and cooperative workers, regardless of their political views, will jointly seek solutions to the economic problems that are the focus of the world's attention. The Initiating Committee has solemnly announced that this conference will not discuss the political issues that are dividing the world today.
    The Initiating Committee has invited representatives here not to waste their energy and time in debating the merits and demerits of the various economic and social systems in the world. It is undeniable that the economic and social systems of certain countries are fundamentally different. No one will be happy about the rifts in commercial relations between these different systems, especially when so many countries are suffering from economic difficulties. The Initiating Committee invites everyone to come and explore the possibilities of restoring and developing economic relations between countries, regardless of the economic and social systems of these countries. Like many people, the Initiating Committee believes that the restoration of normal economic relations between countries can gradually lead to international cooperation, thereby making it possible to improve the living conditions of the people and utilize the economic resources of all countries while respecting the independence of each country.
    The Initiating Committee invites the representatives attending the conference to study how the development of normal international commercial relations and the increase of foreign trade can be conducive to expanding production, increasing the number of jobs, and reducing the cost of living in various countries.
    The Initiating Committee especially requests everyone to study the possibility of expanding trade between the East and the West, and between economically backward countries and industrialized countries.
    We live in an era of progress, but many countries still live in economic conditions that are not commensurate with our era. It is unfortunate that we still have to talk about backward countries in the 20th century. Is it not possible to work together to eliminate poverty in the world? This poverty creates chaos and hinders economic development, while the development of the economy is something that mankind, who has already dominated nature, has the right to demand.
    Of course, in order to expand the volume of international trade and to improve the welfare of the people, people have already made commendable efforts. Some official agencies have tried to solve many problems. We are not here to discuss why they have not succeeded. Our goal is to study whether it is possible, through joint efforts and with the help of such a conference, to help overcome the difficulties that the representatives of the governments of various countries have failed to solve. In other words, the purpose of the Initiating Committee is not to hold a conference that will replace the activities of existing international organizations. Its purpose is to use other methods—and recognizing that this conference is currently the only place where representatives from all over the world can gather—to help restore economic relations between countries. We are pleased that people belonging to different economic categories have the opportunity to gather together, have the opportunity to deepen mutual understanding, and discuss their common problems together. The Initiating Committee believes that it is beneficial to alternate plenary sessions with group meetings. In the group meetings, the issues raised at this conference can be studied more thoroughly. The Initiating Committee will propose a concise work plan, which will be finalized by the conference. I believe that the agency that you will now elect to preside over your discussions will certainly do its best to promote meetings between representatives engaged in the same professional sector or paying attention to the same issues. The conference will take practical organizational measures to facilitate contact between representatives of various countries.
    The Soviet Preparatory Committee has assured us that it will do its best to facilitate your private contact with representatives of Soviet economic institutions.
    The Initiating Committee has now completed its task. It entrusts the responsibility of continuing the work it began six months ago to the conference.
    Finally, let me express my wish that our work will lead to universal agreement; that we will have the opportunity to establish personal contacts, thereby paving the way for other conferences; and that through the free and sincere discussions of good people, we will strive to find solutions that can provide a solid foundation for relations between countries; and that the prosperity and friendship of all countries can be built on this foundation. (Prolonged applause).
    Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet,
    Yasnov, Delivers Welcome Speech
    Next to speak was Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, who was greeted with enthusiastic applause by those attending the meeting. Yasnov delivered a welcome speech as follows: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:
    On behalf of the Moscow City Soviet of Working People's Deputies, I would like to welcome the International Economic Conference. We are very honored to hear that you have chosen the Soviet capital, our city of Moscow, as the venue for such an important conference.
    Gathered here are representatives of the business community from East and West, from the People's Republic of China and Indonesia, from Poland andCzechoslovakia, from the German Democratic Republic and France, from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, from India and Pakistan, from Italy and the United Kingdom, from Finland and Sweden, from Argentina, Brazil and other countries, prominent economists, leaders of trade unions, cooperatives and people's organizations.
    The purpose of the International Economic Conference is to study the current situation of international trade and to discuss the issue of developing international economic cooperation in order to improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of people in the world.
    The broad masses of people of all strata and representatives of the economic community are eagerly awaiting the results of your discussions.
    I believe that this explains why the International Economic Conference held in Moscow has attracted the wide attention not only of the business community, but also of the general public in various countries of the world.
    Mr. Chamberlain said that this is the first time that so many entrepreneurs, manufacturers, merchants, economists, prominent trade union leaders, leaders of cooperative undertakings and social celebrities from countries with various social systems have gathered together to discuss extremely important economic issues. He is quite justified in saying this.
    The representatives attending the meeting, regardless of their political views and beliefs, are united by the noble purpose of seeking ways and means to improve the plight of the people.
    As stipulated by the Initiating Committee, a free and frank exchange of views will undoubtedly help to make your meeting a success.
    Expanding international trade and promoting international economic cooperation are of paramount importance for mutual understanding between peoples of all countries and for maintaining and consolidating peace. I would like to state that Moscow is always ready to help.
    The people of Moscow will pay close attention to your work, and it goes without saying that this concern will extend to a wide area outside Moscow.
    Ladies and gentlemen:
    We are very pleased to be able to welcome you, not only as representatives of the International Economic Conference, but also as guests of Moscow.
    I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to visit our city, visit our theaters, exhibitions, museums, construction sites and factories, see our subways and other interesting places in the Soviet capital.
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Moscow City Soviet of Working People's Deputies, to wish you all success in your important work.
    (Prolonged applause)
    Pakistani representative Iftikharuddin, on behalf of the Initiating Committee, proposed that representatives of the business community from the following countries be selected to form the presidium: Argentina: Rivera, Director of the Central Statistical Office of Argentina; Austria: Professor Taublaetzberger; Brazil: Engineer and economist Oliveira; China: Nan Hanchen, President of the People's Bank of China; Czechoslovakia: Paul, President of the Czechoslovak State Bank; France: Bastié, former Minister of Commerce; German Democratic Republic: Kuchkov, President of the German Emission Bank; United Kingdom: Lord Boyd-Orr; Iran: Dr. Daftari, Member of Parliament; Italy: Franco, Member of the Sicilian Parliament; Pakistan: Iftikharuddin, Publisher and Member of the Constituent Assembly; Poland: Professor Lange; United States: Industrialist Weakly; Soviet Union: Nesterov, President of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce; Netherlands: Professor de Vries of Higher Education Economics; as well as representatives from India and West Germany. Chamberlain was unanimously elected Secretary-General of the International Economic Conference.
    Polish Representative Lange
    Reports on Discussions of the Preparatory Committee
    Next to speak was Polish representative Lange. His speech was as follows: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:
    Mr. Chamberlain has already spoken in detail about the genesis of the International Economic Conference in his opening speech. Now, I would like to talk in more detail about the discussions of our Initiating Committee, how we decided on the main issues to be discussed at our International Economic Conference and the agenda of the conference.
    The purpose of this conference is to study whether it is possible to normalize and develop economic relations between countries with different economic and social systems. The initiators of the conference firmly believe that differences in economic and social systems are not sufficient to prevent countries from engaging in peaceful, mutually beneficial exchanges of goods and services, nor are they sufficient to prevent mutually beneficial economic cooperation. They believe that in the current world economic situation, such cooperation is particularly needed. The fact that this conference has aroused such widespread concern among the business community, economists, trade unionists and cooperative workers around the world is sufficient proof that this belief is well-founded.
    All the attendees gathered in this hall today come from different countries, have different views on economic, social and political matters, and represent different social and economic systems. However, they all sincerely hope to seek ways and means to develop international economic cooperation and expand international trade.
    In the countries of Western Europe, the United States of America, Canada and the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, the need and benefits of such economic cooperation are becoming increasingly apparent. For many of these countries, the normalization of world trade and the expansion of their foreign trade markets have become a pressing need. All these countries have responded well to the proposal to convene an International Economic Conference, the results of which have been demonstrated by the attendance in this hall.
    The proposal to convene an International Economic Conference has also been endorsed in the Soviet Union, China and the European People's Democracies.
    Their tremendous development of industrial production, the modernization and development of agricultural production, and the steady rise in the living standards and cultural levels of the people have increased their ability to import products from other countries and export their own products. They do want to share in the benefits of promoting world trade, and they are now able to do so on a much larger scale than before the war.
    In this way, the proposal to convene an International Economic Conference has been well received in countries with different economic and social systems. The Initiating Committee found that the people of all these countries were willing to cooperate because they clearly understood that the normalization and development of international economic relations and the expansion of international trade are mutually beneficial. Based on the discussions that generated the above responses, the Initiating Committee specifically formulated the following agenda at its first meeting held in Copenhagen last October:
    "To seek the possibility of improving the living conditions of the people through peaceful cooperation between various countries and various systems, and through the development of economic relations between countries." The convening of this conference is to discuss this issue. In order to facilitate the discussion and ensure that a wider range of participants have the opportunity to express their views and discuss the issues that they are particularly concerned about, the Initiating Committee suggested at the meeting held in Copenhagen that this conference should begin with a plenary session, followed by group meetings, and then end with a plenary session. In this way, the initial plenary session would enable the participants to conduct a basic exchange of views, the intermediate group meetings would ensure the opportunity to discuss specific issues in more detail, and the final plenary session would enable the representatives to study the results and conclusions obtained in the discussions of the group meetings.
    Following this general direction, the Initiating Committee decided at its meeting held on April 2, 1952, to submit the proposed work plan to this conference, which has been distributed to you today. Regarding this plan, I would like to make the following explanations:
    The general purpose of this plan is to avoid placing too heavy a burden on the attendees of the conference, so that they have the fullest time to establish personal contacts, especially business contacts, as this is the main purpose of our conference. Therefore, except for April 5th and 7th, we will in principle only hold meetings in the morning. The reason for holding additional group meetings on April 5th and 7th is because the groups need enough time to conduct discussions.
    The other details of this plan are self-explanatory. I now propose that we adopt this plan.
    After discussion, the conference adopted the work plan and the rules of procedure proposed by Mr. Lange.
    The first day of the meeting ended here.
    The next meeting will be held on April 4th.

    国际经济会议四月三日会议详情
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：国际经济会议于四月三日在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅开幕，出席者有企业家、经济学家、工程师、工会和合作社领袖、经济杂志和报纸的编辑等。他们来自奥地利、阿根廷、英国、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、巴西、法国、德意志民主共和国、印度、伊朗、意大利、巴基斯坦、波兰、苏联、西德、瑞典、芬兰等四十二个国家。一部分出席者仍在赴莫斯科途中。参加开幕会议的还有苏联和外国报纸代表及许多来宾。
    国际经济会议筹委会秘书长
    香贝朗致开幕辞
    国际经济会议发起人委员会筹备委员会秘书长香贝朗代表筹备委员会在第一次会议上致开幕辞。他的讲词如下：诸位女士，诸位先生：
    国际经济会议发起人委员会让我在这里向你们表示欢迎。
    我谨以发起人委员会的名义，对于你们的接受邀请，对于你们搁下了自己重要的事务抽出时间来参加这个会议，对于许多人因此而经过长途辛苦的跋涉，表示感谢。
    我同时对于苏联筹备委员会及其主席、全苏商会主席奈斯特洛夫先生，对于使我们能在最好的条件中工作的完满的布置，对于苏联主人给我们的热情招待，以及苏联这种闻名遐迩的好客传统，表示我们深切的感谢。我确信，我这样是表达了会议全体出席者的愿望。
    会议出席者已经到了莫斯科的有三百三十九人，各代表团的专家七十九人。二十九名出席者刚刚到达，另外五十名还在途中。
    在这大厅内聚集了这样多的人，不久在途中的人还要到达参加，这一点就使我们这一个会议具有极大的重要性。各个经济制度不同的国家有这样多负重要职责的企业家、经济学家、工会和合作社人士同时聚集在一起，共同研究大家的问题，这还是第一次。
    这是发起人委员会的目标之一，它能够达成这个目标，实堪引以自豪。
    今天，全世界的注意力都集中在莫斯科国际经济会议上，这一点是十分可以理解的。当这样多的国家都在遭受着严重的经济困难的时候，莫斯科经济会议就成了一个迫切的需要而且成了一个充满实现可能的希望了。
    只有那些认为各国间危险的竞争是他们发财之道的人，才会对旨在恢复各国经济关系并改善全体人民生活条件的建议采取敌意的漠不关心的态度。
    发起人委员会决定参加这次会议的代表人数为四百五十人。以保证这个会议的最大重要性和最大效能。如果说这个数字稍有超过的话，这只是为了适应发起人委员会所收到的，特别是在过去几个星期之内所收到的越来越多的请求。然而，无论怎么样，发起人委员会始终是充分认识到有必要保持各国间的公平的均衡的；现在来到莫斯科的代表团的多方面性和多样性，就证明了在推选代表时并没有什么歧视；推选代表时所遵循的唯一原则是使会议尽可能代表各个不同的有关国家的经济利益。
    关于这个会议的性质曾有过许多荒谬的评论，因此，现在追述一下会议筹备工作的各个阶段的情况并不是多余的。
    要召开这样一个会议的主张的具体形成是在一年多以前。这个主张是在什么情况下形成的呢？当时在巴黎，西欧若干国家的企业家、经济学家和工会工作者举行了第一次集会。他们对他们自己国家所遭受的经济困难感到苦恼；这种困难在很大程度上是由于他们国家进行贸易的地理范围越来越缩小以及他们各个国家的贸易的片面性造成的。这种贸易的片面性使它们完全不可能调整他们的支付平衡。这种情况包藏着严重的经济困难并使重要经济部门有发生危机的危险，他们被这种情况所苦恼是理所当然的，因此他们就自己提出问题：设法与东欧各国恢复正常经济关系的时机是否已经成熟呢？由于这些东欧国家迅速的经济发展以及它们的稳定市场，与它们恢复正常的经济关系是适宜的。
    这便是召开经济会议的动机的由来。召开经济会议是经济上的必要所促成的。当初的计划的确是有限的，但是经过了历次会议和个人接触的结果，范围随着扩大了。
    这个倡议在那些旨在促进国际谅解的团体和运动中得到了响应，要隐瞒这个事实是没有用的。但是为了忠于历史，应该指出，在与许多经济部门的代表的商谈中，大家认识到，经济会议的范围应该扩大，参加的人数应该增加，因为这是由一个与任何运动和任何组织以及任何政府都没有关系的绝对独立的机构发起的。
    过去的目的和现在的目的都是召开一个由私人参加的而不是由政府代表参加的会议。主要的考虑是促进各国的经济合作以及争取一切希望参加这个努力的人们，而不需要他们同意任何团体或政府的目标或政策。
    发起人委员会便是这样成立的。
    发起人委员会组成分子是二十一个国家的经济界人士，他们与任何运动或任何政府都没有关系。尽管委员会委员们大公无私的努力工作有时遭到了不公正的批评，但是委员会终于为这次会议奠定了基础，这应当归功于它。至于这次会议是否能具有历史重要性，现在要看我们的努力了。
    发起人委员会于去年十月在哥本哈根举行第一次会议，当时初步看出了大家对经济会议的兴趣，而现在经济会议已经引起全世界的兴趣了。
    我不打算详细报告发起人委员会在其第一次会议上或以后的工作成绩。我需要说的只是：由于委员会全体委员的努力，使这次会议成了一个严肃的事业，能够对付国际经济情况的严重性。当时发起人委员会所发表的公报以及委员会所得出的结论，都充满了坚定不移的愿望，要尽一切可能恢复国际经济关系，促进国际合作的崇高事业。我们大家都希望国际间不再有敌对状态，而代之以国际合作。
    为什么要在莫斯科开会呢？常常有人这样问。这也是一个需要加以说明的问题。会议的发起者对于任何城市都没有特别的偏爱。但是，只有在各国代表能够会聚一堂的条件下，才有可能讨论各国间的经济关系。委员会曾经向发起者认为可能作为开会地点的若干中立国家的政府作过试探，但是困难立刻来了，因为这些国家所提出的条件如经接受，真正的世界会议便不可能举行。如果同意在一个中立国家举行会议，而没有得到发给中国和苏联代表——只提一下这两个国家就够了——入境签证的保证，那末我们的会议便将成为一个有限地理范围的会议，并且丧失了一切实际价值。苏联代表团建议莫斯科为会议地点，并且提供了举行这样一个会议所不可或缺的保证。发起人委员会的唯一希望就是为国际经济合作的事业服务，并且愿意在任何能保证提供像苏联所提供的便利的国家举行会议，因此，谁能够责备发起人委员会接受了这个建议呢？
    今天，许多人认为选择莫斯科做会址是很好的。这个地方可使我们许多人能够亲自看到在未来之前了解得不完全的经济现实，并且估计一下这样一个国家给国际贸易提供的巨大可能性。这个国家是一个广大的市场，同时它的出口潜力是不容否认的。我们已经说过：发起人委员会的目的是召开一个郑重的经济性质的会议，在这个会议上，经济学家、企业家、工会与合作社工作者，不管政治见解如何，将共同寻求全世界注意力焦点所在的经济问题的解决办法。发起人委员会曾十分郑重地宣布：这个会议将不讨论今天使世界陷于分裂的政治问题。
    发起人委员会邀请代表们到这里来，不是为了要他们来耗精费神地进行关于世界上各种经济与社会制度的优劣的争辩。不可否认的，某些国家的经济与社会制度根本上是不同的。任何人都不会对这些不同的制度之间的商业关系上的裂痕感到高兴，特别是在这么多的国家正在遭到经济困难的时候。发起人委员会请大家到会探讨恢复与发展各国间的经济关系的可能性，不管这些国家的经济与社会制度是怎么样。和许多人一样，发起人委员会认为：各国间恢复正常经济关系可以逐步导向国际合作，从而使改善人民的生活状况和在尊重各国独立的情况下利用一切国家的经济资源成为可能。
    发起人委员会请出席会议的代表研究：如何发展正常的国际商业关系和增加对外贸易，才能有利于扩大各国生产、增加就业人数和减低生活费用。
    发起人委员会特别请求各位研究扩展东方与西方之间、经济落后国家与工业国之间的贸易的可能性。
    我们生活在一个进步的时代，可是很多国家仍然生活在与我们这个时代不相称的经济状况之下。我们在二十世纪还必须谈论落后国家，这是很不幸的事。共同努力消灭世界上的贫困，难道不是可能的吗？这种贫困产生混乱并阻碍经济发展，而发展经济却是已经主宰了自然的人类有权利要求的。
    当然，为了扩大国际贸易量、为了增进人民的福利，人们已经作了值得赞扬的努力。有些官方机关曾经力图解决许多问题。我们不是要讨论它们为甚么没有成功。我们的目标是研究是否可能借共同的努力，并借着这样一个会议的帮助，来协助克服各国政府的代表所未能解决的困难。换句话说，发起人委员会的目的并不是举行一个代替现有国际机构进行活动的会议。它的目的是用其他的方法——并领悟到这个会议是目前唯一可能汇集世界各国代表的地方——协助恢复各国间的经济关系。属于不同经济范畴的人们有机会聚集在一起、有机会加深相互间的了解并在一起讨论他们共同的问题，对这件事，我们感到高兴。发起人委员会认为：如果使全体会议和小组会议交互进行，是有好处的。在小组会议上，那些提到这个会议上来的问题，可以获得更为彻底的研究。发起人委员会将提出一个简明的工作计划，由会议作最后的决定。我相信，诸位现在就要选举出来主持大家的讨论的机构，一定会尽力促进那些从事同样职业部门或注意同样问题的代表们之间的会议。会议将采取实际的组织措施，以期各国代表能方便地彼此接触。
    苏联筹备委员会向我们保证：它将尽最大的努力来便利大家与苏联经济机构的代表作私人的接触。
    发起人委员会现在已完成了它的任务。它把继续进行它在六个月前开始的工作的职责，交托给会议。
    最后，让我表达一下我的愿望：希望我们的工作将导致普遍的协议；希望我们有机会建立个人的联系，从而为其他的会议开辟道路；并且希望通过善良人们的自由与真挚的讨论，我们将努力寻找足以为各国的关系提供巩固基础的解决办法；而各国的繁荣和友好就可以建立在这个基础上面。（经久不息的掌声）。
    莫斯科市苏维埃主席
    雅斯诺夫致欢迎辞
    接着讲话的是莫斯科市苏维埃主席雅斯诺夫，出席会议的人以热烈的掌声欢迎他。雅斯诺夫致欢迎辞如下：主席先生，各位女士，各位先生：
    我代表莫斯科市劳动人民代表苏维埃向国际经济会议表示欢迎。我们听说你们选择苏联首都、我们的莫斯科市作为这样一个重要会议的开会地点，感到非常荣幸。
    聚集在此地的是来自东方与西方，来自中华人民共和国与印度尼西亚，来自波兰与捷克斯洛伐克，来自德意志民主共和国与法国，来自罗马尼亚、保加利亚和匈牙利，来自印度与巴基斯坦，来自意大利和英国，来自芬兰和瑞典，来自阿根廷、巴西与其他国家的企业界代表，著名的经济学家，工会、合作社和人民团体的领袖。
    国际经济会议的目的是要研究目前国际贸易的情况并讨论发展国际经济合作问题，以提高世界上千百万人的生活水准。
    广大的各阶层人民及经济界代表都在渴切地等待着各位讨论的结果。
    我相信，这就说明了为什么在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议不仅引起了企业界人士的广泛注意，同时也引起了世界各国一般人的广泛注意。
    香贝朗先生说，有这么多来自各种社会制度的国家的企业家、制造商、商人、经济学家、杰出的工会领袖、合作事业领袖及社会名流共聚一堂，来讨论极端重要的经济问题，这还是第一次。他这种说法是十分有理由的。
    与会的代表们，不分政治见解和信仰，在寻求改善人民处境的方式和方法这一崇高目的下团结起来了。
    如发起人委员会所规定的，自由坦率地交换意见无疑地会有助于使你们的会议成功。
    扩大国际贸易和促进国际经济合作，对于各国人民相互了解和维持与巩固和平，是头等重要的条件。我愿意说明，莫斯科随时准备给以帮助。
    莫斯科人民将密切注意各位的工作，不消说，这种关心将扩大到莫斯科以外的广大地区。
    各位女士，各位先生：
    我们能够欢迎你们，感觉到很愉快，你们不仅是国际经济会议的代表，同时又是莫斯科的客人。
    我想借此机会邀请各位参观我们的城市，访问我们的剧院、展览会、博物馆、建筑现场和工厂，看看我们的地下铁道以及苏联首都其它有趣的地方。

    报告筹委会讨论经过
    接着是波兰代表兰基发言。他的讲辞如下：主席先生，各位女士，各位先生：
    香贝朗先生在他的开幕辞中已经详细地谈到国际经济会议产生的经过。现在，我愿意更详细地谈一下我们发起人委员会的讨论经过，我们怎样决定了我们国际经济会议要讨论的主要问题以及会议的议程。
    这个会议的目的，是要研究是否有可能使经济制度和社会制度不同的国家的经济关系正常化，并使它发展。会议发起人深信，经济制度和社会制度的不同，并不足以妨碍各国间进行和平，互利的货物和服务的交换，也不足以妨碍对大家都有利的经济合作。他们认为，在目前世界经济情况下，这样的合作是特别需要的。我们这个会议在全世界的工商界、经济学家、工会和合作社人士当中引起那样普遍的关切，就足以证明这种信念是很有根据的。
    今天聚集在这个大厅里的全体出席者，来自不同的国家，他们在经济、社会和政治方面具有不同的见解，他们代表了不同的社会制度和经济制度。可是，他们都一致诚恳地希望求得一些方式和方法以发展国际经济合作和扩大国际贸易。
    在西欧各国，美利坚合众国、加拿大和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的国家，这种经济合作的需要和利益日益明显。对于这些国家中的许多国家来说，世界贸易的正常化和扩大它们对外贸易的市场已经成为迫切需要。所有这些国家都对召开国际经济会议的主张产生了很好的反应，其结果已由这个大厅内的出席情况表现出来。
    召开国际经济会议的主张在苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家内，也得到了赞同。
    它们的工业生产的巨大发展、农业生产的现代化与发展、人民生活水准与文化水平的稳步上升，提高了它们输入其他国家产品和输出本国产品的能力。它们确实想分享促进世界贸易的利益，现在它们能够在比战前大得多的规模上做这件事。
    这样，召开国际经济会议的主张已经在有着不同的经济与社会制度的国家内得到良好反应。发起人委员会发现所有这些国家的人民因为明确地了解到国际经济关系的正常化与发展和国际贸易的扩大是对大家都有利的，所以都愿意合作。根据产生上述反应的讨论，发起人委员会特于去年十月在哥本哈根举行的第一次会议上制订议程如下：
    “经由各个国家和各种制度间的和平合作、经由发展各国间的经济关系来寻求改善人民生活状况的可能性。”召开这个会议便是为了讨论这个问题。为了便于讨论，并保证更广大的参加者有机会畅述他们的见解和讨论他们特别关心的问题，发起人委员会在哥本哈根举行会议的时候曾建议这次会议以全体大会开始，继之以小组会议，然后以全体大会结束。这样，最初的全体大会就使得与会者能就他们的意见进行基本交换，中间的小组会就能保证有机会更具体地讨论专门问题，最后的全体大会就可使代表们能研讨小组会议在讨论中所得到的结果与结论。
    遵循着这个总的方针，发起人委员会在一九五二年四月二日举行的会议上决定把建议中的工作计划提交这次会议，这个计划今天已经分发给各位了。关于这个计划，我愿作以下说明：
    这个计划的总目的是要避免使会议给予与会者过重的负担，以便他们有最充分的时间来建立个人联系，特别是业务上的联系，因为这是我们会议的主要目的。因此，除了四月五日和七日外，原则上我们只在上午开会，五日和七日是因为要使小组有足够的时间来进行讨论，所以不得不召开额外的小组会议。
    这个计划的其它细节是不言自明的。我现在提议通过这个计划。
    大会经过讨论后，通过了工作计划及兰基先生提出的程序规则。
    第一天的会议至此结束。
    下次会议将于四月四日举行。
