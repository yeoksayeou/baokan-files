Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: In order to prepare cadres for larger-scale industrial construction in the future, the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department has decided to adopt various methods to cultivate more construction talents.

In the past, the Northeast Industrial Department had already cultivated a large number of cadres using various methods. In the past three years, it has restored and opened three universities, four specialized colleges, and sixteen secondary technical schools, cultivating a large number of technical and management cadres. The secondary technical schools alone have produced more than 2,500 graduates in the past two years. The 1,200 graduates who left school in February timely solved the difficulties of cadre shortages in various units during the "Three-Anti" campaign. The three universities will have more than 500 graduates taking up work positions this year. It is estimated that from this year to 1957, these three universities can cultivate more than 13,000 students to participate in industrial construction. In order to improve the ideological and professional level of in-service cadres, the various departments under the Northeast Industrial Department ran a total of eight training classes last year, training more than 4,000 in-service technical and management cadres. Another method of cultivating in-service cadres is to implement a cadre candidate list system. This method involves selecting targets in advance, and then cultivating them purposefully and systematically. This method has also been very effective.

Although the Northeast Industrial Department has cultivated a large number of cadres in the past three years, it still cannot meet the needs of industrial development. Therefore, this year the department has decided to open three more secondary technical schools, restore one secondary technical school, and universally expand the existing universities and secondary technical schools. The sixteen secondary technical schools plan to enroll 10,000 students throughout the year; the seven institutions of higher learning (including three universities and four specialized colleges) plan to enroll 4,000 students. The Northeast Industrial Department requires each administrative bureau to run at least one training class, training 5,000 to 7,000 in-service technical and management cadres throughout the year. In order to meet the needs of large-scale capital construction, it has been decided to expand the civil engineering and construction departments of various universities and secondary technical schools. Of the four secondary technical schools newly opened and restored this year, at least one school must make civil engineering and construction its main subject. In addition, the Northeast Industrial Department has also decided to vigorously expand technical worker schools. Five technical worker schools were opened last year, training 8,000 technical workers. This year, the number will be increased to eight or nine, training at least 40,000 technical workers.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: A large number of newly promoted workers in the Kunming Electrical Equipment Factory have become familiar with production and management techniques in a short period of time. In the past, some old foremen and old technicians consistently prevented workers from having the opportunity to learn technology, and did not want workers to approach key technical departments. Now the workers have swept away this obstacle. For example, the wire threading of the precision rolling machine in the rolling workshop was always considered to require highly skilled technology. Cao Chunshan, the former director of the workshop, never allowed workers to have the opportunity to learn this technology. In the anti-corruption movement, Cao Chunshan was transferred away from the workshop due to corruption. The leadership promptly promoted three new workers, Shao Ju and others, to learn this technology. With the help of veteran workers Yang Shaojin and Dong Xiang, one of them has completely mastered the operating techniques and can work independently. In March, the entire workshop created a new record that exceeded the quota by 23 percent. As another example, six new female workers were transferred to the insulation workshop to learn varnish cooking techniques. Because of their hard work, they quickly became familiar with the operating procedures for varnish cooking.

In order to enable these newly promoted worker cadres to exchange work experience, the factory leadership convened a forum for them to introduce good working methods and encourage them to study hard. This kind of forum is of great help in improving the working ability of new cadres. For example, Li Zhixian, the newly promoted head of the purchasing team, learned new working methods at the forum, changed the shortcomings of being busy and disorganized, and greatly improved the material procurement work. Some new cadres who lacked confidence also received help from leaders and other comrades at the forum, which improved their work confidence and improved their business.

    东北工业部决定培养大批工业建设人材
    昆明电工器材厂提拔的工人干部迅速学会生产管理技术
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】为了给今后更大规模的工业建设准备干部，东北人民政府工业部已决定采取各种办法培养更多的建设人材。
    过去东北工业部已经用各种办法培养了大批干部。三年来共恢复和开办了三个大学、四个专科学校、十六个中等技术学校，培养了大批技术干部和管理干部。仅中等技术学校两年来出校的学员就有两千五百多名。今年二月出校的一千二百名学员及时地解决了“三反”中各单位干部缺乏的困难。三个大学今年将有五百多名学员走上工作岗位。据估计，从今年开始到一九五七年止，这三个大学可以培养出一万三千多名学员参加工业建设。为了提高在职干部的思想和业务水平，去年东北工业部所属各部门共开办了八个训练班，先后训练了四千多名在职的技术干部和管理干部。培养在职干部的另一种办法是实行干部候补名单制。这种办法是事先选择对象，然后有目的、有计划地加以培养。这种方法收效也很大。
    东北工业部三年来虽然培养了大批干部，但仍然不能满足工业发展的需要。因此，该部今年决定再开办三个中等技术学校，恢复一个中等技术学校，原有的大学和中等技术学校普遍加以扩充。十六个中等技术学校，今年全年预定招生一万名；七个高等学校（包括三个大学、四个专科学校）准备招生四千名。东北工业部要求每个管理局至少要开办一个训练班，全年要训练在职的技术干部和管理干部五千到七千人。为了适应大规模的基本建设的需要，决定扩充各大学和中等技术学校的土木建筑部分，今年新开办和恢复的四个中等技术学校中，至少要有一个学校把土木建筑做为主要学科。另外，东北工业部还决定大力扩充技术工人学校。技术工人学校去年已开办了五所，培养出八千名技术工人，今年要增加到八所或九所，至少要培养出四万名技术工人。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：昆明电工器材厂大批新提拔的工人短期内都熟悉了生产和管理技术。过去一些旧领班旧技术人员，一贯不让工人有学习技术的机会，不要工人接近技术要害部门。现在工人们已把这层障碍扫除了。如辗压车间精辗机的抢线头，一向认为需要有高度熟练的技术，该车间前主任曹春山从不让工人有学习这种技术的机会。在反贪污运动中，曹春山因为贪污被调离了车间。领导方面及时提拔邵举等三个新工人学习这种技术。他们在老工人杨绍金、董祥的帮助下，已有一个完全掌握了操作技术，能独立工作。三月份全车间创造了比定额超过百分之二十三的新纪录。另如绝缘车间新调了六个女工学习熬漆技术，由于她们努力钻研，很快就熟悉了熬漆的操作规程。
    为了使这些新提拔的工人干部交流工作经验，该厂领导方面曾召集他们开座谈会，介绍好的工作方法，鼓励他们努力学习。这种座谈会对提高新干部的工作能力有很大帮助。如新提拔的采购组长李志贤，在座谈会上学到了新的工作方法，改变了工作忙乱无计划的缺点，使材料采购工作大为改进。有些信心不高的新干部，在座谈会上得到了领导和其他同志的帮助，也提高了工作信心，改进了自己的业务。
