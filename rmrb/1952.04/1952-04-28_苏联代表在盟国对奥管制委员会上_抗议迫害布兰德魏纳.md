Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 26th: TASS, Vienna, April 26th—The Allied Council for Austria held a meeting on April 25th, chaired by Soviet High Commissioner Lieutenant General Sviridov. The meeting discussed the issue of the Austrian authorities' persecution of the democratic legal scholar Professor Brandweiner.

It is known that Austrian Minister of Education Korb issued an order on April 17th to dismiss Brandweiner from his position as Professor of International Law at the University of Graz. The reason this scientist suffered such persecution was because of his participation in the peace movement, and especially because he participated in the investigation of the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military against the Korean people and on Chinese territory.

In his statement, Lieutenant General Sviridov emphasized that the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner was without any legal justification. The persecution of this democratic scientist, and the groundless motives for his dismissal, clearly demonstrate that this retaliatory action was taken entirely for political purposes; it is illegal and a provocative act.

Lieutenant General Sviridov proposed a motion requesting the Allied Council to recommend that the Austrian government reinstate Professor Brandweiner and take measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The Western powers' representatives refused to accept the Soviet proposal without offering any strong reasons, claiming that such an incident was within the purview of the Austrian government. They thus supported this arbitrary action by the Austrian ruling clique and endorsed this serious violation of the Control Agreement. The attitude adopted by the Western powers also proves that they are not unconnected with the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner.

    苏联代表在盟国对奥管制委员会上
    抗议迫害布兰德魏纳
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十六日讯：盟国对奥管制委员会于四月二十五日举行会议，苏联高级专员斯维里多夫中将担任主席。会议讨论了奥地利当局迫害民主法律工作者布兰德魏纳教授的问题。
    大家知道，奥地利教育部长科布在四月十七日发布命令，解除布兰德魏纳在格拉茨大学的国际法教授职务。这位科学家之所以遭受这种迫害，是因为他参加了和平运动，特别是因为他参加了调查美军对朝鲜人民以及在中国领土上使用细菌武器的工作。
    斯维里多夫中将在他的声明中着重指出，解除布兰德魏纳教授的职务是毫无任何合法理由的。对这位民主科学家的迫害，以及解除他的职务的毫无理由的动机，清楚地说明了这种报复行动完全是从政治目的出发而采取的；它是非法的，是一种挑拨行动。
    斯维里多夫中将提出动议，要求盟国委员会建议奥地利政府恢复布兰德魏纳教授的职务，并采取措施以防将来发生同样事件。
    西方国家代表并未提出任何有力理由就拒不接受苏联的建议，他们声称这种事件是在奥地利政府权力范围以内的事。他们因而支持奥地利统治集团的这种专横行动，认可这种严重违反管制协议的事件。西方国家采取的这种态度，也证明了它们与解除布兰德魏纳教授职务一举不无关联。
