    Fengfeng Mining Bureau No. 2 Mine
    Increased Production After Strengthening Leadership

    Editor: During the anti-corruption struggle, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau lacked leadership in production, resulting in a 20% decrease in daily output and a 30% decrease in overall efficiency. After realizing this situation, the leading comrades of the Mining Bureau convened a mass meeting on March 9th, clearly pointing out that it was necessary to thoroughly carry out the "Three Antis" campaign and also to improve production. Subsequently, "tiger-fighting" (anti-corruption) and production core teams were organized, and production offices were established in various mines to strengthen leadership over production. At this time, representatives of the returning volunteer army and the delegation of the Korean people visiting China happened to arrive in Fengfeng. Their reports greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. The daily output of Fengfeng No. 2 Mine increased from a regular 1,500 tons to over 1,900 tons, and on March 16th, it jumped to 2,060 tons; the overall efficiency also increased from about one ton to 1.296 tons, exceeding the new record of all mines in Fengfeng. The workers of No. 2 Mine said: "In order to support the most beloved people and strengthen economic construction, we are determined to work harder and create higher new records!"

    峰峰矿务局二矿
    加强生产领导后产量提高
    编辑同志：在反贪污斗争中，峰峰矿务局生产缺乏领导，以致日产量曾降低百分之二十，全员效率降低百分之三十。矿务局领导同志发觉这种情况后，就在三月九日召开群众大会，明确指出要彻底进行“三反”，也要搞好生产。接着，组织了“打虎”基干大队和生产基干大队，各矿也先后成立了生产办公室，以加强对生产的领导。这时，志愿军归国代表、朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表也恰恰来到峰峰，他们的报告，大大鼓舞了工人们的生产情绪。峰峰第二矿的日产量，就从经常的一千五百吨提高到一千九百多吨，三月十六日，并一跃达到两千零六十吨；全员效率也由一吨左右提高到一点二九六吨，超过了峰峰各矿的新纪录。二矿工人们说：“为了支援最可爱的人，为了加强经济建设，我们决定再努力，创造更高的新纪录！”      李鼎
