    Introduction to the Book "The Regenerative Action of Bone and Muscle," Recipient of the Stalin Prize
    The book "The Regenerative Action of Bone and Muscle," written under the guidance of Professor Studitsky at the Institute of Animal Morphology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and awarded the Stalin Prize, is a major achievement in Soviet biology.
    These scientists have been researching methods to restore or repair tissues lost or injured due to disease or trauma in adult animals (later extended to humans) for many years. Years of research have enabled these scientists to understand the laws of tissue formation and development, and on this basis, they have made a practically significant and important invention. Professor Studitsky's experiments overturned the absurd claims made by bourgeois scientists, who believed that the regenerative power of higher animals and humans was relatively weak. However, experiments have shown that the tissues of both higher and lower animals can regenerate. In the laboratories of the Institute of Animal Morphology, scientists conducted hundreds of experiments on birds, rabbits, and dogs, resulting in the partial or complete regeneration of the humerus, femur, and tibia. Therefore, they proved that the more advanced the tissue, the stronger and faster its ability to resist trauma, and the stronger the bone's regenerative power.
    Professor Studitsky's experiments also overturned the unscientific claim that muscle tissue has no regenerative power. This scientist confirmed that muscles are constantly regenerating, and when necessary, they can compensate for the "consumed" parts. He removed muscles from various parts of the tested birds and mammals, but often, under certain conditions, new muscle grew in the place where the muscle had been removed.
    Professor Studitsky's work has opened up vast prospects for the development of medicine, especially for the development of surgery.

    荣膺斯大林奖金的“骨骼肌肉的再生作用”一书内容介绍
    苏联科学院动物形态学研究所在斯图迪茨基教授指导之下写成的荣获斯大林奖金的“骨骼肌肉的再生作用”一书，是苏联生物学上的一大重要成就。
    这批科学家，研究恢复成年动物（后来也及于人类）因疾病或创伤而丧失或受伤的组织的方法，已有许多年。多年的研究使得这些科学家懂得了组织的形成和发展的规律，并且在这个基础上作了一项具有实际意义的重要发明。斯图迪茨基教授的实验推翻了资产阶级科学家所制造的荒唐奇谈，那些科学家认为高等动物和人的再生力是比较弱的。但实验证明：高等动物与低等动物的组织都能再生。在动物形态学研究所的实验室中，科学家们用鸟、兔和犬做了数百次实验，结果是上膊骨、大腿骨和胫骨都部分或全部再生了。因此，他们证明：组织越是高级，对抗创伤的能力就越强而且越快，骨骼再生力也越强。
    斯图迪茨基教授的实验同时推翻了认为肌肉组织没有再生力的非科学的奇谈。这位科学家证实：肌肉是在不断新生的，必要的时候它们可以弥补“耗去”的部分。他在受试验的鸟和各种哺乳动物的身上割去各种不同部位的肌肉，可是，往往在一定条件之下，被割去肌肉的地方又生出了新肉。
    斯图迪茨基教授的著作为医学的发展、尤其是为外科学的发展，开拓了广大的前途。
