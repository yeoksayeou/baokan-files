    A Company Library on the Korean Front
    By Zhang Shiyi of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battlefield Cultural Service Team
    The people of the motherland must be thinking: the books we donated to the "most beloved people," they must be very happy to read them, right? Are they already reading the few books I sent?
    Yes, tens of thousands of books, like ammunition and grain, have been transported to the Korean front despite the enemy's aerial blockade. Countless small libraries and reading rooms have been established in the soldiers' camps and positions. Let's take a look at the library of one company.
    The Fourth Company had just come down from battle and was stationed in the mountains. Where could they find a place to build a library? "Yes, it can definitely be solved." The company leaders and soldiers worked together, selected a location on the hillside near the company headquarters, and immediately began building a house. Digging earth, felling trees, carrying wood, building walls, constructing the roof frame, clang clang clang, like a factory. In three days, a "Soldiers' Cultural Palace" was built, capable of accommodating the entire company for classes, entertainment, and protection from both air raids and the cold. One soldier happily said: "We are engineers, and also bricklayers and carpenters."
    The library opened, with the three characters "Library" pasted on the door, decorated with pine and cypress, and the interior was brightly lit. In the center of the room was a roaring brazier. On the brand-new yellow mud walls, a colored portrait of the leader hung high. There were also pictures of the motherland's construction and slogans written on old newspapers. On the stepped bookshelves were various books sent by the people of the motherland. On the platform made of wooden canned food boxes were playing cards and chess. Everything here was new.
    The soldiers enthusiastically held a discussion meeting, unanimously agreeing that they must use the books sent by the people of the motherland during the break to study hard and improve their political understanding and combat skills. Hero Chang Fengting, who had been awarded a Second-Class Merit, guaranteed that in addition to working hard to study, he would also teach the other three comrades in his squad to recognize three characters every day. The comrades of the Third Platoon proposed that they would not only guarantee to study hard and cherish the books, but also be willing to regularly clean the inside and outside of the library to maintain cleanliness, in order to express their respect for the enthusiasm of the people of the motherland in sending books. The soldiers cherished the books as much as they cherished their weapons. They said, "Every book has the heart of the people of the motherland on it."
    After the establishment of the company library, reading and studying became an indispensable part of the soldiers' daily lives. They established study covenants, and many soldiers implemented "guaranteed teaching and learning" or "mutual teaching and mutual learning" cooperative study. Those who could read would read, and those with low literacy would listen. They learned to recognize characters while looking at pictures. One soldier had learned more than two hundred characters since he had books. He said, "I didn't know a single character before, I never went to school, and even writing my own name was just making it up; but I never thought that now, in this environment, I would see the books sent by the people of the motherland and be able to recognize these characters. I am truly grateful for the help of the people of our motherland!"
    One soldier said after reading a comic book about a combat hero: "I want to read this book often and learn from this combat hero's combat experience and brave spirit."
    The soldiers also composed快板 (clapperd rhyme) and 鼓词 (drum ballad) based on the content of the books. Whenever there was a break, the soldiers would beat the stones and sing cheerfully. They sang about the deeds of combat heroes and the stories of the people of the motherland loving the motherland. Here, you can feel that the enthusiasm of the people of the motherland in donating every book is burning in the hearts of the soldiers.

    朝鲜前线的连队图书馆
    中国人民志愿军战地文化服务队　张士一
    祖国人民一定在想着：我们捐送给“最可爱的人”的书籍，他们看了一定很高兴吧？我送的那几本，他们已经在阅读了吗？
    是的，千万册图书，同弹药、粮食一样，尽管敌人在空中封锁，也都运到了朝鲜前线。无数的小型图书馆和阅览室，在战士们的营地和阵地上建立起来了。让我们看下面一个连队的图书馆吧。
    四连刚从战斗中下来，住在山上。那儿去找建立图书馆的房子呢？“有，一定可以解决。”连首长和战士们一齐动手，在连部附近的半山腰选定了地点，马上开始造房。挖土，伐树，扛木头，筑墙壁，造房架，叮叮当当，好像一所工场。三天功夫，一所能容全连人上课、娱乐、能防空又防寒的“战士文化宫”筑成了。一位战士欢喜地说：“咱们是工程师，又是泥水匠和木匠。”
    开馆了，门上贴着“图书馆”三个大字，扎着松柏，室内有充分的亮光。房子中央放着熊熊的火盆。崭新的黄泥墙上，高悬着彩色的领袖像。还有祖国建设情况的画片和长条的用旧报纸写的标语。台阶形的书台上，摆着祖国人民送来的各种书籍。用装罐头的木箱拼成的台子上，放着扑克和象棋。这里的一切都是新鲜的。
    战士们很热情地开了漫谈会，一致认为：必须在休整中利用祖国人民送来的书籍，努力学习，提高政治水平和战斗技术。立过二等功的英雄长丰亭保证：除自己努力学习外，还要教班里其他三位同志每天认三个字。三排的同志们提出：不但保证努力学习，爱护图书，并且愿意经常打扫图书馆内外，保持清洁，以表示尊敬祖国人民送书的热情。战士们爱惜图书像爱护武器一样。他们说：“每一本书上都有祖国人民的一颗心在上面。”
    连队图书馆成立之后，看书、学习，成了战士们日常生活中不可缺少的一部分。他们订立了学习公约，许多战士实行了“包教保学”或“互教互学”的互助学习。能识字的读，文化低的听。一面看画，一面认字。有位战士从有书以来，已经学会两百多字了。他说：“我本来是一字不识的，没进过学堂，连写自己的名字也是凑合；可想不到现在在这样的环境里，竟看到了祖国人民送的书，能认这一些字了。真感谢咱们祖国人民的帮助！”
    有位战士看了一本战斗英雄的连环画后说：“我要时常看这本书，学习这个战斗英雄的战斗经验和勇敢精神。”
    战士们还根据书籍的内容，自己编了快板和鼓词。每当休息时间，战士们就敲着石头，兴高采烈地唱起来了。他们唱着战斗英雄的事迹，唱着祖国人民的热爱祖国的故事。在这里，你可以体会到祖国人民捐献每一本书的热情，都在战士们的心底燃烧起来了。
