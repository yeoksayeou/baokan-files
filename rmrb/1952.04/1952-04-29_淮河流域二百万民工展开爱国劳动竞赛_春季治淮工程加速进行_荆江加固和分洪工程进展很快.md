Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 28th. In the Huai River basin, the weather is now warm and sunny, and the second year of the spring Huai River harnessing project is being accelerated. At present, the number of civilian workers participating in the construction of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River has reached two million. The Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the lower reaches of the Huai River, which started construction earlier, has now completed more than 90% of the earthwork. The reinforced concrete gate foundation projects of the Gaoliangjian water inlet gate and the Yun (River) East water diversion gate on the irrigation main canal have been completed. At the Baisha Reservoir and Banqiao Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River, civilian workers are working in shifts day and night to complete the construction before the flood season arrives this year. The Foziling Reservoir in the Dabie Mountains in the middle reaches of the Huai River has completed the work of cleaning the dam foundation, excavating the reservoir, and drilling and mining sand and gravel. The flood storage projects in the Wabuhu and Chonghe depressions in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the diversion projects of the main and tributaries of the Huai River below Wuhe County, and the improvement projects of more than a dozen rivers such as the Xifei River, Tuo River, Chong River, and Tong River, although the construction was delayed by one month due to too much rain and snow, more than 8.9 million cubic meters of earthwork have now been completed with the efforts of more than one million civilian workers.

Technical workers, civilian workers, engineers, and all administrative cadres participating in this year's spring Huai River harnessing project have all demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. They have continuously overcome difficulties in the construction process, ensuring the smooth progress of various projects. After the start of the spring project, the Huai River basin suffered several heavy snowfalls, followed by continuous spring rains, and the construction sites were generally flooded. In many construction sites in the Fuyang area of northern Anhui, the water depth reached about one meter. However, under the slogan of "No work stoppage in light rain, less stoppage in heavy rain," the civilian workers worked hard to drain the water and stepped up the excavation of earth; draining one piece and excavating one piece. When the Mengcheng County civilian workers' team lacked drainage tools, they organized 18,000 civilian workers and concentrated 3,000 bamboo buckets to drain the water in three days, and continued construction. When the Huaiyuan County civilian workers dredged the Chong River and Tong River, they encountered a large amount of groundwater and stinging reed roots, and the work efficiency was very low. The technical research team in Wang Tingxiu's civilian workers' team devised a method of using water suction buckets and digging reed roots, which quickly improved the work efficiency of all civilian workers. The water pump on the Foziling Reservoir construction site was not suitable. The technician team leader Qi Dianlai and the technician Shang Xiuli and others studied a modification method, which not only solved the difficulties, but also saved money for the country.

In order to accelerate the progress of the project, civilian workers in various places launched a patriotic labor competition on the construction site. More than 80% of the 800,000 civilian workers on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal construction site have been involved in competitions comparing efficiency, standards, operating methods, and labor combinations. In the competition, the earth excavation efficiency of civilian workers in the Yancheng area generally increased from one cubic meter to two cubic meters, and the highest reached more than four cubic meters. The 300,000 Huai River harnessing civilian workers in the entire area originally planned to complete the work in 40 sunny days, but completed it in 32 sunny days.

Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, 28th. The progress of the Jingjiang levee reinforcement and Jingjiang flood diversion projects is very rapid. The Jingjiang reinforcement project completed the riprap bank protection and other projects along the river from Shashi to Haoxue in early April, and the entire project is expected to be completed in mid-May. The Jingjiang flood diversion project is now mainly repairing the north and south gates. The North Gate is the flood inlet gate of the flood diversion area near Taipingkou on the south bank of the Jingjiang River. The South Gate is the control gate on the Hudu River. The Taipingkou flood inlet gate project has completed 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the gate foundation and has begun to pour the base plate with concrete; the South Gate has also begun to pour the concrete base plate.

The Taipingkou flood inlet gate is the largest construction project in the Jingjiang flood diversion project. The entire project requires a total of 3.4 million cubic meters of earthwork, 81,800 cubic meters of concrete, and 81,000 cubic meters of rubble. The gate construction project encountered many difficulties from the beginning. The military workers and civilian workers led by the flood inlet gate project headquarters are overcoming these difficulties with a hundredfold labor enthusiasm. For example, because the wharf near Taipingkou is small and the tonnage of transport ships is large, the unloading of equipment is very slow; the military workers and civilian workers participating in the supply work divided the handling force into two shifts, day and night, to work in shifts, which increased the handling speed from more than 2,000 tons per day to more than 6,000 tons. After the start of construction, there were many days of heavy rain, and the construction site was full of mud. However, the military workers and civilian workers dug ditches to drain the water and insisted on working day and night.

The Jingjiang levee reinforcement project includes: 1. Eight bank protection stone works in Shashi and Qijiayuan, Guanyinsi, etc. below Shashi, with a total length of 5,849 meters, requiring 41,193 cubic meters of cobblestones. 2. Forty-two levee raising earthworks in Shashi, Haoxue and other areas, totaling 332,282 cubic meters. Now there are more than 20,000 civilian workers on the levee every day, and their work enthusiasm is very high. In the past, it took 20 people three days to load 200 tons of stones onto the ship. Now the workers use pulleys to load the stones, and 30 people can fill a 250-ton barge overnight. The efficiency of riprap work has also doubled compared to the past.

Tang Tianji, the general commander of the Jingjiang flood diversion project, and Dong Yucai, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers who returned to China, and Park Young-ho, the representative of the Korean people who visited China, recently visited the construction site. They all praised the labor enthusiasm and effectiveness of the military workers and civilian workers participating in the construction project. Encouraged by the visit, the military workers and civilian workers are now putting their enthusiasm into various rush repair projects. They all unanimously guaranteed to complete the task on schedule and do it quickly and save money.

    淮河流域二百万民工展开爱国劳动竞赛
    春季治淮工程加速进行
    荆江加固和分洪工程进展很快
    【新华社蚌埠二十八日电】淮河流域现在日暖天晴，第二年度治淮春季工程正在加紧施工。目前淮河上、中、下游参加施工的民工已达二百万人。开工较早的淮河下游苏北灌溉总渠，现在已完成土工百分之九十以上。灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸和运（河）东分水闸的钢筋混凝土闸基工程已经完工。淮河上游的白沙水库和板桥水库，民工们正夜以继日地轮班施工，以争取在今年洪水汛期到来以前修成。淮河中游大别山区的佛子岭水库，已完成清理坝基、开挖蓄水池，和钻探、开采砂石等工作。淮河中游的瓦埠湖、漴河洼地等蓄洪工程和五河县以下的淮河干、支流分流工程，以及西淝河、沱河、漴河、潼河等十几条河道的整理工程，虽然都因雨雪太多，动工延迟了一个月，但在一百多万民工努力下，现在已完成了土工八百九十多万公方。
    参加今年春季治淮工程的技术工人、民工、工程师和全体行政干部，都发挥了高度的积极性。他们在施工中不断克服困难，保证了各项工程顺利进行。春季工程开工后，淮河流域连遭几场大雪，后来又逢绵绵春雨，工地普遍积水。皖北阜阳专区境内的许多工地，积水深达一公尺左右。但是民工们在“小雨不停工，大雨少停工”的口号下，一面努力排水，一面加紧挖土；排干一块，挖清一块。蒙城县民工总队排水时缺乏排水工具，他们就组织起一万八千个民工，集中了三千只笆斗戽水，三天内就把积水排清，继续施工。怀远县民工疏浚漴河、潼河时，遇到大量的地下水和刺脚的芦根，工作效率很低。王廷秀民工小队中的技术研究小组就设法用吸水桶和挖芦根的办法，使全体民工的工作效率很快提高。佛子岭水库工地上的抽水机不合用，技工大队长戚殿莱和技工尚修礼等就研究出改装办法，不但解决了困难，还为国家节省了资财。
    为了使工程加速进行，各地民工在工地上展开了爱国劳动竞赛。苏北灌溉总渠工地上的八十万民工，百分之八十以上都卷入了比效率，比标准，比操作方法，比劳动组合的竞赛。竞赛中，盐城专区民工的挖土效率普遍由一公方提高到两公方，最高的达四公方以上。全专区三十万治淮民工，原计划在四十个晴天内完成的工作，结果在三十二个晴天内便完成了。
    【新华社沙市二十八日电】荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程的进展都很快。荆江加固工程在四月上旬已完成了沙市以下郝穴沿江一带的抛石护岸等工程，全部工程预计五月中旬可完成。荆江分洪工程现在主要在修南北两闸。北闸即荆江南岸太平口附近分洪区的进洪闸。南闸为虎渡河上的节制闸。太平口进洪闸工程已完成闸基土工三十万公方，开始以混凝土浇灌底板；南闸也已开始浇灌混凝土底板。
    太平口进洪闸是荆江分洪工程中最大的一项建筑工程。全部工程共需作土方三百四十万公方，混凝土八万一千八百公方，块石八万一千公方。建闸工程一开始就遇到许多困难，进洪闸工程指挥部领导军工和民工正以百倍的劳动热情克服这些困难。如由于太平口附近的码头小，运输船只吨位大，器材卸船很慢；参加供应工作的军工和民工，就将搬运力量分成日夜两班，轮班工作，这样就把搬运速度由每天两千多吨提高到了六千多吨。开工后一连遇到好多天大雨，工地上到处是泥浆。但军工和民工们挖沟排水，仍日夜坚持工作。
    荆江大堤加固工程包括：一、沙市和沙市以下的祁家渊、观音寺等八处护岸石工，共长五千八百四十九公尺，需蛮石四万一千一百九十三万公方。二、沙市、郝穴一带四十二处培堤土工，共计三十三万二千二百八十二公方。现在每日上堤民工有两万多人，他们的工作情绪很高。过去装二百吨石头上船，二十个人需要三天才能搬运好，现在工人们改用滑车装，三十个人一夜时间即装满了一只二百五十吨的驳船。抛石工作的效率也比过去提高了一倍。
    荆江分洪总指挥唐天际和中国人民志愿军归国代表董玉才，朝鲜人民访华代表朴英镐等最近曾赴工地视察，他们都赞勉参加兴修工程的广大军工、民工的劳动热情和成效。受到鼓励的军工、民工，现在都热情百倍地投入各项赶修工程中去。他们一致保证按期完成任务，并做到又快又省钱。
