Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th. The ceremony for Guo Moruo to accept the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize was held at 2:00 PM on the 9th in the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin. Hundreds of representatives from Soviet mass organizations, writers, artists, and advanced workers from Moscow attended the ceremony. Chinese writer Mao Dun and Korean writer Li Jiyong also participated in the ceremony.

    Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, after reading the committee's decision to award the prize, presented Guo Moruo with a gold medal engraved with Stalin's image and a certificate, and delivered a congratulatory speech. Subsequently, Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, Grekov, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, and Simonov, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Association, also delivered speeches of congratulations.

    Guo Moruo delivered the following acceptance speech amidst warm applause: Mr. Chairman, dear friends:

    Today, I accept the International Peace Prize commemorating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin.

    This is not only my personal supreme honor, but also the supreme honor of all the Chinese people.

    This not only gives me personal supreme encouragement, but also gives all of us Chinese people supreme encouragement.

    Stalin is the sun of all mankind, and the working people of the world celebrate his longevity from the bottom of their hearts.

    Wherever Stalin's brilliance shines, there is light, there is life, there is prosperity, and there is peace.

    We Chinese people, inspired by the spirit of Marshal Stalin and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have won independence, freedom, and democracy, and thus have made contributions to peace in Asia and the world.

    But in the future, we still have much hard work to do. Promoting domestic economic construction and cultural construction, and developing international economic and cultural exchanges all require us to redouble our efforts so that peace can be guaranteed.

    Especially at present, when American interventionists are conducting germ warfare in China and Korea, we Chinese people must wage a strong struggle, unite with peace-loving people all over the world, and jointly stop this heinous crime to defend peace, defend humanity, and defend ourselves.

    I have written a poem entitled "Glory and Mission" to express what I want to say from the bottom of my heart today. Please allow me to read it out.

    Stalin's golden image,
    Shines brilliantly on my chest.
    I represent the Chinese people who defend peace,
    As an image,
    Accepting the glory of all the Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong,
    But also accepting a solemn mission, which is of profound significance today.

    Friends all over the world who love peace have cordially congratulated me, and young men and women all over China have sung the song of defenders of peace for me. A twelve-year-old Korean boy sent me a letter from Pyongyang, asking me to send him a photo of myself wearing the Stalin Prize medal. He said: Thank you, Grandpa Stalin and Soviet uncles, for liberating us, and thank you, Chinese People's Volunteers, for using your flesh and blood to help us defend our homeland. Stalin is a symbol of peace, and the Soviet Union and China are guarantees of peace. When I grow up, I will also become a defender of peace and accept Stalin's glory. The boy's name is Quan Dongsheng, and his sincere words are so touching. Can he receive the photo he needs? I cannot guarantee it. Because he is under the serious threat of American interventionists dropping germ bombs, his fate is the same as that of tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese children. Yes, Stalin is a symbol of peace, and all mankind needs peace. But there are a few bloodthirsty people who want to monopolize, blockade, interfere in the internal affairs of others, rack their brains, and exterminate humanity, just thinking about how to kill a large number of people, and they want to exhaust all methods, just to take the lives of innocent children! We must appeal, we must loudly appeal, appeal to the conscience of mankind: For the right of children to survive, for the dignity and civilization of mankind, we must wage a relentless and resolute struggle against the two-legged Bacillus, and we must wipe out the bacteria-carrying insects, toys, candy, rubber snakes, etc.! Today, I have accepted the supreme glory, and I have also accepted a solemn mission; I want to convey to the world the firm determination of our Chinese people: We will work harder to consolidate world peace and will never hesitate. Under the wise brilliance of Stalin, humanity will surely defeat bacteria! My poem is finished.

    I want to express my own and the Chinese people's deep gratitude.

    We Chinese people have accepted Marxism-Leninism, received the spiritual encouragement of Marshal Stalin, and the selfless help of the great Soviet people, and have been freed from all the shackles of the old era! Under the same conditions, we firmly believe that we will be able to gloriously complete our solemn mission and move from one victory to another.

    The brotherly friendship of 700 million people is the source of invincible peace power.

    We must always learn from the great Soviet people, learn revolutionary technology, and also learn the technology of building the country! We must make science and art serve the people, and make China quickly become a fortress of peace like the Soviet Union.

    I have decided to donate all 100,000 rubles of the prize money to the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression. I think it is the best use to use the peace prize money for the cause of peace.

    Finally, please allow me to express my greatest sincerity in wishing the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people eternal development!

    May the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union be increasingly consolidated!

    May the savior of all mankind, the greatest defender of world peace, Marshal Stalin, live forever!

    莫斯科克里姆林宫举行隆重典礼
    郭沫若接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    热情诵诗“光荣与使命”传达中国人民保卫和平的坚毅决心
    【新华社莫斯科十日电】郭沫若接受“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金典礼，于九日下午二时在克里姆林宫斯维德洛夫大厅举行。参加典礼的有苏联各群众团体的代表、作家、艺术工作者和莫斯科先进工人数百人。我国作家茅盾和朝鲜作家李箕永也参加了典礼。
    斯大林国际和平奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴在宣读了委员会授奖的决定之后，以刻有斯大林像的金质奖章和奖状一份授予郭沫若，并致贺词。接着，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃、苏联拥护和平委员会副主席格列科夫和苏联作家协会副总书记西蒙诺夫也相继致辞祝贺。
    郭沫若在热烈掌声中致答词如下：主席先生，亲爱的朋友们：
    我今天接受了为纪念斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的国际和平奖金。
    这不仅是我个人的无上的光荣，也是我们全中国人民的无上的光荣。
    这不仅给予我个人以无上的鼓励，也给予我们全中国人民以无上的鼓励。
    斯大林是全人类的太阳，全世界的劳动人民都从心坎里庆祝他万寿无疆。
    斯大林的光辉所照耀着的地方，便有了光明，有了生命，有了繁荣，有了和平。
  我们中国人民，受着斯大林大元帅的精神感召，在毛泽东同志的领导之下，争取到了独立、自由、民主，因而对于亚洲的和世界的和平有了贡献。
    但在今后，我们应该努力的工作还很多，促进国内的经济建设、文化建设，发展国际的经济交流、文化交流，都需要我们加倍努力，和平才能够有保障。
    尤其在目前，美国干涉者，在中国和朝鲜境内，正在进行着细菌战，我们中国人民更必须作坚强的斗争，和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致，共同制止这一滔天罪行，以保卫和平、保卫人类、保卫自己。
    我做了一首诗，题名“光荣与使命”，来表达我今天心坎里所要说的话。请允许我把它念出吧。
    斯大林的金质的英容，辉煌地，照耀在我的胸上。
    我代表着保卫和平的中国人民，作为一个形像，
    接受了毛泽东同志领导下的全中国人民的光荣，
    但也接受了一个庄严的使命，在今天是意义深长。
    全世界爱好和平的友人都曾经殷勤地向我道贺，全中国的青年男女都为我高唱着保卫和平者之歌。有一位十二岁的朝鲜少年，给我一封信，寄自平壤，要我送他一张照片，是我自己佩带着斯大林奖章。他说：多谢斯大林爷爷和苏联大伯伯们，把我们解放，多谢中国人民志愿军，把自己的血肉帮我们保卫家乡。斯大林就是和平的象征，苏联和中国就是和平的保障，我长大了也要成为和平的保卫者，接受斯大林的荣光。这少年的名字叫全东圣，他的真挚的话是这样动人，他能不能接受到他所需要的照片呵，我可不能保证。因为他是在美国干涉者投掷细菌弹的严重威胁下，他的命运同于成千成万的朝鲜和中国儿童的命运。是的，斯大林是和平的象征，全人类都需要和平。但偏有少数渴血者，要垄断、封锁、干涉别人内政，挖空心思，灭绝人性，只是想怎样地才能大量杀人，而且要想尽方法来，专为夺取无辜的儿童们的生命！我们要呼吁，要大声地呼吁，呼吁，向着人类的良心：为了儿童的生存权，为了人类的尊严性与人类的文明，必须和两条腿的巴奇鲁斯们作毫不容情的坚决斗争，必须把带菌的昆虫、玩具、糖果、橡皮蛇等，消灭干净！我今天接受了无上的光荣，也接受了庄严的使命；我要向全世界传达出我们中国人民的坚毅的决心：我们要更进一步为巩固世界和平而努力，决不逡巡，在斯大林睿智的光辉之下，人类一定要战胜细菌！我的诗念完了。
    我要表示我自己的和我们中国人民的深沉的感谢。
    我们中国人民接受了马克思列宁主义，得到斯大林大元帅的精神上的鼓舞和伟大的苏联人民的无私的帮助，已经解脱了一切旧时代的枷锁！在同样的条件之下，我们坚决地相信，一定能够光荣地完成我们的庄严的使命，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    七万万人的兄弟友谊，是不可战胜的和平力量的源泉。
    我们永远要向伟大的苏联人民学习，学习了革命的技术，还要学习建国的技术！要使科学和艺术为人民服务，使中国赶快地成为像苏联一样的和平堡垒。
    奖金十万卢布，我已决定全部捐献给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会。和平的奖金为和平的事业而使用，我觉得是最好的用途。
    最后，请让我以最大的诚意祝中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊永恒发展！
    祝以苏联为首的和平民主阵营日益巩固！
    祝全人类的救星、最伟大的世界和平保卫者斯大林大元帅万寿无疆！
