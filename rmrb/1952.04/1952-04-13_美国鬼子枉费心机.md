    "American Devils' Efforts Are in Vain"
     Wu Maosun
    "Production must be active, and epidemic eradication must not be delayed. American devils' efforts are in vain."
    On March 25th, we inspected a factory in Fushun that had been sprayed with poisonous insects by American aircraft. The workers' reading room had been converted into an office for epidemic prevention work. The above quote is a striking and powerful slogan we saw in this office. According to the report from the responsible comrade: The arrival of American planes to spread poisonous insects aroused the workers' unparalleled anger. They unanimously mobilized to actively carry out insect extermination and epidemic prevention work. When we went to the site for inspection, the workers described to us in detail the situation of discovering and eliminating the poisonous insects spread by the American aggressors.
    Near a workers' dormitory in a mine in Fushun, we saw hundreds of women swatting poisonous insects. They were all workers' family members, and they had all put aside their housework to engage in insect extermination work. They will surely wipe out the insects completely. Worker's family member Zhao Peihua said: "We suffered under the oppression of the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for fourteen years, eating tree bark and grass roots, with nowhere to call home. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came, and we all turned over. Look how good the Western-style houses we live in are! They even have heating. Now the American devils are here again to spread poisonous insects to harm us, we must fight them to the death. We will work together to exterminate insects and improve sanitation. The US imperialism's bacteriological warfare will also be in vain!"
    On March 19th, we went to Langtou in the suburbs of Andong City and saw groups of farmers swatting poisonous insects. According to reports from local responsible parties: From March 5th to 18th, the masses caught more than 150,000 flies, more than 180,000 spiders, more than 10,000 mosquitoes, and many other kinds of insects.
    Workers, women, farmers, youth, and general urban residents have all been mobilized. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, a strong and massive people's anti-bacterial warfare front has been formed, exerting great and unparalleled power. The American imperialism cannot estimate the great power of the Chinese people. The wisdom of the Chinese people has created various methods of insect extermination and epidemic prevention, which are also difficult for the American imperialism to imagine. We firmly believe that the crime of bacteriological warfare committed by the American imperialism will be shattered by the great strength of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.
    The Fushun workers are right: "American devils' efforts are in vain!"

    “美国鬼子枉费心机”
     吴茂荪
    “生产要积极，灭疫莫迟疑，美国鬼子枉费心机。”
    三月二十五日，我们在抚顺勘察一个被美国飞机撒了毒虫的工厂，工人的图书阅览室已改作了防疫工作的办公室，上面就是我们在这办公室内所看到的一条醒目有力的标语。据负责同志的报告：美国飞机来撒毒虫，引起了全厂工人无比的愤怒，他们都一致动员起来，积极地做灭虫防疫工作。我们到现场上勘察时，工人们详细地向我们讲述了发现和消灭美国侵略者所撒布的毒虫的情形。
    在抚顺一个矿场工人宿舍的附近，我们看见几百个妇女在扑灭毒虫，她们都是工人的眷属，她们都是丢开了家事，来搞灭虫工作。她们一定会把虫子消灭干净。工属赵佩华说：“我们受日本鬼子和蒋介石匪帮的压迫十四年，吃树皮草根，无家可归。毛主席、共产党来了，我们全翻了身，你瞧我们住的这洋房子有多好！里面还有暖气。现在美国鬼子又来撒毒虫害我们，我们非和他拚命不可。我们齐心合力灭虫子，搞好清洁卫生，美帝国主义进行细菌战也是白费！”
    三月十九日，我们去安东市郊区的浪头，看见成群的农民都在扑灭毒虫。据当地负责方面报告：从三月五日至十八日，群众捉到苍蝇十五万多个，蜘蛛十八万多个，蚊子一万多个，还有很多其他种类的虫子。
    工人、妇女、农民、青年和一般城市居民都动员起来了，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，形成了坚强的、巨大的人民反细菌战的战线，发挥了伟大无比的力量。中国人民这样伟大的力量是美帝国主义所不能估计到的。中国人民群众的智慧，创造了各种各样的灭虫防疫办法，也是美帝国主义所难于想像的。我们坚信，美帝国主义进行的细菌战罪行，必为中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的伟大力量所粉碎。
    抚顺工人说得对：“美国鬼子枉费心机！”
