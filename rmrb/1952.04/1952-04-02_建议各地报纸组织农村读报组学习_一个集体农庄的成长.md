    To the Editor:
    I was deeply impressed by the article "The Growth of a Collective Farm" published in the People's Daily on March 24th and 25th. It depicted a happy and beautiful picture before my eyes. It pointed out a bright path for farmers, educating and guiding them towards collective labor and the beautiful future of socialism. I suggest that newspapers in various regions vigorously organize rural reading groups to study and discuss this article.
    For thousands of years, farmers have been laboring in a scattered manner. To quote Jiang Dongxun from the article, "Even brothers quarrel, how can farmers who don't know each other farm together?" Indeed, this is the thinking of most farmers. How to remove these generations-old ideas from the farmers? The most effective method is to educate them with facts - the superiority of collective labor. The story of Hong Rinan mentioned in this article (Hong Rinan did not believe that collective farms were the place to thoroughly liberate farmers, so he drove his ox cart to the north of the Songhua River to "create a life of independent happiness". He labored alone, like an ox, but ended up not having cotton clothes to wear in winter and had to rely on breaking ice in the Songhua River to catch fish every day) is a stark contrast between collective labor and individual labor, and it is very persuasive. Then there's Jiang Dongxun, who initially did not want to participate in collective labor, but under the education of facts, he became a new type of farmer who loves collective labor and cherishes public property. The article describes Jiang Dongxun like this: "In the busy threshing ground, an old villager with scars on his face is working nervously next to the electric thresher. ... Not long ago, when he was threshing with the thresher, he accidentally got the rope tied to the rice stalks on his hand caught in the thresher. ... He suffered serious injuries: his face and eyes were broken, and his arm was injured to the point where he could not turn it. The farm management committee, according to the regulations of the farm, allowed him to rest for five days and still calculated his workdays. However, on the third day, Jiang Dongxun came to the threshing ground again. The villagers all advised him to go back to rest, and the farm chairman also criticized him for neglecting his body. He thanked everyone for their concern, but insisted on his own opinion: 'Worrying is more uncomfortable than pain. I can't stand being at home, let me do some light work!'" This short passage profoundly illustrates the new thinking of the new type of farmer and the close relationship between them. I believe that every farmer who reads this passage will cherish the collective farm and will be grateful from the bottom of their hearts for everyone's concern for Jiang Dongxun; they will therefore recall their past lives, recall the relationships between people in the past, and love this new life. This is good material for educating farmers.
    In order to plan and lead the vast number of rural reading groups to study and discuss this article, I hope that newspapers in various regions will use a certain amount of space to publish the learning situation and discussion results of the reading groups.

### 建议各地报纸组织农村读报组学习“一个集体农庄的成长”

    建议各地报纸组织农村读报组学习“一个集体农庄的成长”
    编辑同志：人民日报在三月二十四、二十五两日刊载的“一个集体农庄的成长”一文，给予我以深刻的印象。它在我的眼前描绘出一幅幸福而美丽的图画。它给农民指出一条光明之路，它教育农民、引导农民，走向集体劳动、走向社会主义的美好的前途。我建议各地报纸大力组织农村读报组学习、讨论这篇文章。
    几千年来，农民都是在分散的劳动着。引用这篇文章中姜东勋所说的话吧，“亲兄弟还有个争吵，素不相识的农民怎么能在一起共耕呢？”确实，这是大部分农民的思想。怎样把农民这些世代相传的观念去掉呢？最有效的方法是用事实——集体劳动的优越性来教育他们。这篇文章中提到洪日南的故事（洪日南不相信集体农场是彻底解放农民的地方，因而赶着他的牛车到松花江北去“创造独自幸福生活”，他单独地、像牛一般地劳动，结果却是冬天穿不上棉衣，只好每天靠着在松花江破冰捉鱼来生活），就是集体劳动与单独劳动的鲜明对照，它具有很大的说服力。再说姜东勋吧，这个在起先不愿参加集体劳动的农民，在事实的教育下，他却成为热爱集体劳动、爱护公共财产的新型农民了。文章中是这样描写姜东勋的：“在忙碌的打谷场上，一位脸上带着伤痕的老年庄员，正在电力脱谷机旁紧张的劳动着。……不久前，他正在用脱谷机脱谷的时候，一不小心，挽在手上束稻禾的绳子，让脱谷机给搅住了。……他受了很重的伤：脸、眼摔破了，胳臂摔得不能转动。农场管理委员会根据农庄的规定，让他休养五天，照样给他计算劳动日。可是，第三天姜东勋就又到打谷场上来了。庄员们都劝他回去休养，农庄主席也批评他不该忽视自己的身体。他感谢大家对他的关心，但却坚持自己的意见：‘心烦比伤疼还难受。我在家闷不住，让我干点轻活吧！’”这简短的文字，深刻地说明了新型农民的新的思想和他们之间亲密的关系。我相信，每一个农民，读了这段述说都会珍贵集体农庄，都会从内心来感激大家对姜东勋的关心；他们会因此回忆自己过去的生活，回忆过去人与人间的关系，而热爱这种新的生活。这是教育农民的好题材。
    为了有计划地领导和组织广大的农村读报组学习和讨论这篇文章，我希望各地报纸用一定的篇幅发表读报组的学习情况和讨论的结果。
