    Protesting the Austrian Government's Persecution of Peace Fighter Brandweiner
    By Zhou Gengsheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and Legal Scholar

    Professor Brandweiner, a member of the World Peace Council, is a just international law expert. He came to Korea and China as the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team. After completing the task of investigating the atrocities of the U.S. military, he returned to his home country, Austria. Fearing that Brandweiner would report the crimes of the U.S. military in Korea and China in Austria, the U.S. occupation forces instructed the Austrian government to limit Professor Brandweiner's activities in every possible way and unreasonably dismissed him from his position as a professor at the University of Graz. This matter has not only aroused the anger of the Austrian people but also the anger of peace-loving people around the world who respect truth and uphold justice. Everyone is deeply concerned about this matter and unanimously opposes the reactionary measures of the U.S. imperialists and their accomplice, the Austrian government.

    The investigation team led by Professor Brandweiner, standing on the position of peace and justice, undertook the sacred task of upholding justice. The investigation team's report contains a lot of testimonial and material evidence. The U.S. imperialists, unable to deny this exposed evidence, resorted to persecuting Professor Brandweiner, who announced the facts, in an attempt to silence him. This is a futile attempt to cover up the truth, which only reveals their guilty conscience, meanness, and viciousness.

    The Americans often say they advocate guaranteeing "freedom of speech," but now they do not allow a representative of an international organization to speak freely based on facts. The Austrian Peace Council was scheduled to hold a conference on the 19th of this month to invite Professor Brandweiner to report on the facts of the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare in Korea, but the conference was temporarily banned by the police. So, the so-called freedom of speech of the United States is that the U.S. imperialists have the freedom to slander others, but they do not allow others to report on the crimes of the U.S. military.

    The U.S. occupiers are also talking a lot about their so-called academic freedom and the dignity of academic institutions in Austria. Now, an Austrian university professor, for the sake of peace and justice, performs an international investigation task in his capacity as an expert, reports the facts, but the U.S. occupation authorities instruct the Austrian government to dismiss him from his university professorship and persecute him. What kind of academic freedom and dignity of academic institutions is this?

    We must call on peace-loving people all over the world, including university professors and lawyers from all countries, to rise up and support Professor Brandweiner, who is directly subjected to persecution, and wage a resolute struggle against the U.S. imperialist occupation authorities and their lackeys. We further welcome the resolution of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at the Oslo meeting: to organize an international committee to collect scientific materials on the spot with the help of well-known experts. The results of the on-the-spot investigation will thoroughly expose the criminal facts of the U.S. military and publicize them more thoroughly and extensively to the world. Even if the U.S. imperialists dare to persecute individual peace fighters, they cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world. Justice cannot be concealed by the bloody hands of evil. The jurists who are being persecuted by the U.S. warmongers today may be the judges who will try war criminals tomorrow.

    抗议奥地利政府迫害和平战士布兰德魏纳
    中国人民外交学会副会长、法律学家  周鲠生
    布兰德魏纳教授是世界和平理事会的理事，是一位有正义感的国际法学家。他以国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长的身份来到朝鲜和中国，完成了美军暴行的调查报告任务以后，回到他的祖国奥地利。美国占领军害怕布兰德魏纳在奥地利报告美军在朝鲜和中国的罪行，便指使奥地利政府千方百计地限制布兰德魏纳教授的活动，并无理地解除其格拉茨大学教授的职位。这件事情，不但激起了奥地利人民群众的愤怒，并且激起了全世界尊重真理，主张正义，爱好和平的人民的愤怒。大家对此事深切关心，一致反对美帝国主义者和其帮凶奥地利政府的反动措施。
    布兰德魏纳教授领导的调查团，站在和平正义的立场，担负了主持正义的神圣任务。调查团的报告有很多人证物证的材料。美帝国主义者既无法否认这些已被揭发的证据，乃以迫害宣布事实的布兰德魏纳教授来塞人之口，那是欲盖弥彰，适足见其作贼心虚，卑鄙和恶毒。
    美国人常常说他们主张保障“言论自由”，现在却不许一个国际性团体的代表根据事实自由说话。奥地利和平理事会预定本月十九日召开大会，请布兰德魏纳教授报告美军在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实，大会却临时被警察禁止了。那么，美国的所谓言论自由，就是美帝国主义者有诬蔑人家的自由，而不许人家有报道美军罪行的自由。
    美国占领者也在奥地利大谈其所谓学术自由，学府尊严。现在一位奥国的大学教授为了和平正义，以专家资格执行国际调查任务，报告事实，而美国占领军当局却指使奥地利政府解除他的大学教授职位，加以迫害。这算什么学术自由、学府尊严？
    我们要号召世界上爱好和平的人们，包括各国大学教授们和法律家们，起来支援直接遭受迫害的布兰德魏纳教授，对美帝国主义的占领军当局及其走狗作坚决的斗争。我们更欢迎世界和平理事会执行局在奥斯陆会议的决议：组织国际委员会，在著名的专家帮助下实地搜集科学的材料。实地的调查结果，将使美军犯罪事实彻底暴露，更彻底、更广泛地公布于世界。美帝国主义者纵然敢于迫害和平斗士个人，究竟不能一手掩盖世人耳目。正义是罪恶的血手所遮掩不住的。今日受着美国战争贩子迫害的法律家，明日可能就是审讯战争罪犯的审判官。
