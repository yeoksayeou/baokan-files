    Madam Pandit, Head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Speaks at the Airport
    We bring to this great nation of China the greetings and goodwill of the government and people of another great nation. Geographical environment and historical relations have tied China and India together. In the past few thousand years, countless pilgrims have crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia, as well as the perilous seas of Southeast Asia, traveling from India to China, and from China to India. These pilgrims, many of whom are well-known in your history books, as well as in our history books, are true envoys of friendship and goodwill between the two countries. These pioneers have contributed to enhancing the friendship between our two great nations and enriching the cultures of our two great nations. It is hard to find another example in history where two nations, bordering each other, have been able to live in peace for thousands of years.
    In recent months, our government and people have had the honor of welcoming a government cultural delegation sent by your country. From them, we have learned many things, and we hope that they have also brought back many friendly memories from their visit.
    My colleagues and I, forming the first government delegation from free India to visit New China, feel happy and proud because we have been sent here to follow in the footsteps of earlier pilgrims and pioneers. We are also a kind of pilgrim, seeking understanding and friendship that is so needed in the world today.
    We hope and pray that this visit of ours, like that of our ancestors who visited your country at the dawn of history, will produce beneficial and lasting results for our two countries and for humanity.

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, held a reception on the evening of the 29th to entertain the Indian Cultural Delegation.
    Among those present were: Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Trade of the Central People's Government; Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of Culture; Wei Que, Vice Minister of Education; Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Publishing Administration; Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wu Yuzhang, President of the People's University of China; Xing Xiping, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Fan Changjiang, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chen Jiakang, Acting Director of the Asian Department; Hong Shen, Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council; Sha Kefu, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, as well as Yuan Zhongxian, Chinese Ambassador to India, Li Yimang, Deputy Head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to India and Burma, and more than one hundred others.
    Panikkar, the Indian Ambassador to China, and diplomatic personnel from the embassy were also invited to the reception.
    During the reception, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu first delivered a welcoming speech (published separately). Madam Pandit, the head of the delegation, said in her speech: "The cultural relations between China and India have a history of thousands of years. We earnestly hope that this connection will grow in the future." She said: "China recently sent a cultural delegation to India, from whom we learned about the great progress you have achieved here and the great engineering projects you are undertaking. We hope you will complete them successfully." She expressed her gratitude for the hospitality and welcome the delegation had received.
    The reception took place in a friendly atmosphere.

    Welcoming Speech by Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government
    Ladies and Gentlemen:
    I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Indian Cultural Delegation visiting our country, and I am honored to introduce Madam Head of Delegation and all the members to the government leaders and well-known figures in the cultural circles of our capital, Beijing.
    China and India have a long-standing relationship in both cultural and economic aspects. This visit of the Indian Cultural Delegation to our country will make a significant contribution to enhancing cultural exchange and friendly relations between China and India. Last winter's visit to India by our Chinese cultural delegation has already taken Sino-Indian friendship a step forward; the Indian Cultural Delegation will inevitably build on this good foundation and accomplish better and newer achievements. The improvement of friendly relations between China and India is of great help to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    In the past two years or more, our country has done a lot of work in the cultural and economic fields, and in the future, our government and our people will continue to make greater efforts. The Indian Cultural Delegation is preparing to visit some universities and research institutes, rural areas, factories and projects, historical sites and scenic spots; and to visit some scholars and writers, and model figures in agriculture and industry. I firmly believe that the cultural and economic construction work that we have completed and are completing will arouse the interest of our Indian friends.
    I once again express my warm welcome and wish Madam Head of Delegation and all members good health.

    印度文化代表团团长潘迪特夫人在机场的谈话
    我们给中国这一伟大国家，带来了另一伟大国家的政府和人民的敬礼与善意。地理环境与历史关系，使中印两国联系在一起。在过去几千年中，无数的巡礼者，越过中央亚细亚的丛山与荒漠，以及东南亚风险的海洋，由印度旅行到中国，由中国旅行到印度。这些巡礼者，其中有许多在贵国史籍中，同样在我国史籍中都是很著名的，他们是两国友谊与善意的真正使节。这些先驱者对于增进我们两大国家的友谊，并丰富我们两大国家的文化，都有所贡献。历史上再难找出另外一个例子，像我们两大国家，互相接壤，而能和平相处至数千年之久。
    前几个月我国政府与人民曾很荣幸地欢迎贵国惠然派遣的政府文化代表团。从他们那里，我们学习了许多东西，同时我们希望他们也带回来了访问过程中的许多友好的记忆。
    我的同事和我，这次组成自由印度派赴新中国的第一个政府代表团，都感觉到高兴与自豪，因为我们竟能被派前来，追随早期巡礼者与先驱者的步武。我们也是一种巡礼者，寻求今天世界上如此需要的谅解与友谊。
    我们希望并祈求：我们这一次访问，能像曾在历史的黎明时期访问过贵国的我们祖先那样，给我们两国和人类产生有益和耐久的结果。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫在二十九日晚举行酒会，招待印度文化代表团。

    印度驻华大使潘尼迦及大使馆外交人员也应邀赴会。
    席间，章汉夫副部长首先致欢迎辞（另发）。代表团团长潘迪特夫人致辞说：“中印两国之间的文化关系已有几千年的历史。我们恳切希望未来这种联系将会增长。”她说：“中国不久前派到印度一个文化代表团，从他们那里我们知道了你们这里所达成的伟大进步以及你们所正在进行的伟大工程计划。我们希望你们胜利完成。”她对代表团所受到的招待和欢迎，表示感谢。
    酒会在友好空气中进行。
    中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长欢迎词各位女士、各位先生：
    我谨向访问我国的印度文化代表团表示热忱的欢迎，并荣幸地介绍团长阁下及各位团员与我国首都——北京的各位政府首长与文化界著名人士见面。
    中国和印度两国间，在文化方面和经济方面，都有着悠久的关系。印度文化代表团这次访问我国，对于增强中印两国的文化交流与友好关系，会有它重大的贡献。去年冬季我国文化代表团的访问印度，已经使中印友谊向前进了一步；印度文化代表团必然会在这个良好基础上，完成更好的与更新的成就。中印间友好关系的增进对亚洲的与世界的和平事业，有很大的帮助。
    两年多以来，我国在文化领域与经济领域上，曾经作了许多工作，今后我国政府与我国人民还要继续作更大的努力。印度文化代表团的莅临，将准备参观一些大学与研究所，农村、工厂与工程，古迹与风景区；访问一些学者与作家，农业与工业的模范人物。我深信我们已完成的和正在完成的文化和经济建设工作，将会引起我们印度朋友的兴趣。
