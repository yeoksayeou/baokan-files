    The North China Native Products Company's Native Products Exchange Symposium has been open for a week. Public sector economic departments and private industrial and commercial sectors in various regions and Tianjin have actively participated in transactions, playing a certain role in promoting the exchange of native products. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of the meeting, the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council decided to expand the scope of transactions on the basis of the Native Products Exchange Symposium and hold the North China Materials Exchange Conference. This will vigorously promote the sale of rural native products, organize the supply of industrial products to rural areas, and further prosper the urban and rural economy of North China on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements.
    The exchange conference is scheduled to run from April 21st to May 10th. In order to expand the scope of material exchange and better meet the trade requirements of various regions and industries, in addition to the participation of relevant public sector economic departments and private industrial and commercial operators in Tianjin, the exchange conference will also invite public sector economic departments, cooperative organizations, and private industrial and commercial operators from various parts of North China to form trade delegations or trade groups by special district and county to participate in transactions in Tianjin. They will promote the local rural native products and purchase various industrial products to meet the needs of the vast rural areas and cities. During the exchange conference, the implementation of contracts and agreements signed last year between various regions and various public and private enterprises will also be reviewed to strengthen and establish new trade relations.
    The exchange conference will have the following departments: 1. Native Products Department, with four groups: industrial raw materials, medicinal materials, mountain dried goods, and sugar and groceries; 2. General Merchandise Department, with three groups: daily necessities, hardware, and textiles; 3. Animal Products and Oils Department, with four groups: bristles, hides and furs, eggs, and oilseeds and oils; 4. Service Department, with trust group, People's Bank service group, railway service group, and telecommunications service group.
    The exchange conference has a committee as the leading body of the conference, composed of representatives of relevant public sector units and private industrial and commercial sectors. It has been approved by the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council and has begun working in the North China Native Products Company on Harbin Road, Tianjin.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 16th: In order to invigorate the urban and rural national economy, relevant departments in the Central South region are actively carrying out urban-rural material exchange. At present, the key to promoting urban-rural material exchange in the Central South region lies in fully opening up the sales channels for native products. The Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee has instructed all localities to convene a material exchange conference before mid-April to carry out transaction activities and solve the problem of sluggish sales of local and special products. In March, Hunan Province dispatched a group of cadres to North China, Northwest, East China, Northeast and other places to promote more than 30 kinds of local products worth 40 billion yuan. Trade companies in Yongming, Nanxian and other places in the province also organized peddlers and purchasing and marketing teams to go deep into rural areas to carry out purchasing and marketing work. The Jiangxi Provincial State-owned Trading Company has also sent people to East China and other places with samples of local products to promote sales. In order to coordinate transportation work with the region's urban-rural material exchange, the Central South Financial and Economic Committee convened a transportation conference in late March. The Zhengzhou and Hengyang Railway Bureaus, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, and various consignment departments studied and formulated the transportation plan for April. The railway and waterway transportation capacity needed for the region's material exchange has thus been guaranteed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 17th: State-owned specialized companies in Southwest China are vigorously carrying out the procurement of local and special products and the supply and transport of materials to cooperate with rural spring plowing production. The Southwest China Company of the China Oils and Fats Company and its affiliated branches have generally purchased tung oil in Southwest China and entrusted other state-owned companies and legitimate private merchants to collect it on their behalf. Many units also worked as usual on Sundays, thus overfulfilling the original purchase plan. The Sichuan West Branch of the China Native Products Company is purchasing newly listed medicinal materials and native cloth and other products in more than ten counties in western Sichuan and has transported a large number of medicinal materials such as fritillaria, chuanxiong, and cordyceps to Hankou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and the Northwest region for sale. In order to take care of the interests of farmers, local native products companies have set reasonable purchase prices. For example, the market price of Yujing, a newly listed medicinal material in Chongqing and Shuangliu counties in western Sichuan, was as low as 200,000 yuan per dan, and the local native products company purchasing station immediately raised the purchase price to 240,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, farmers flocked to sell Yujing to the native products company purchasing station. Yunnan's famous black tea has recently begun to be listed. In addition to reasonably increasing the purchase price, the local tea company also sent technical cadres to teach tea farmers the complete set of technologies for making and selecting congou black tea, and lent wooden kneading machines and drying, fermentation and other equipment to tea farmers to help them refine tea.
    At the same time as purchasing, state-owned specialized companies in various places have fully launched the supply, sales and transport of materials. Grain companies and native product companies in various places have transferred a large amount of grain, native iron, and fertilizer to meet the needs of farmers for spring plowing and drought prevention. The western Sichuan region has completed the grain transfer plan for the economic crop areas in southern and northern Sichuan before March, stabilizing grain prices in these areas. In areas with more severe droughts, local grain companies promptly supplied grain. The northern Sichuan grain company also organized rural labor to participate in grain transfer and processing work to solve the food problem of some farmers. Native products companies in western and eastern Sichuan have successively transferred large quantities of fertilizers to supply farmers.
    State-owned transportation agencies in various places have also actively improved their operations and reduced freight rates, playing a significant role in the development of urban-rural material exchange. For example, the state-owned transportation departments in western Sichuan improved their operations during the "Three-Anti" movement, basically eliminating the phenomenon of empty trucks returning, which reduced freight rates by a quarter. Therefore, local and special products that could not be transported by trucks before are now also transferred by trucks.
    Due to the active strengthening of purchasing and sales business by state-owned specialized companies in various places, markets in various places are showing active signs. The transaction volume of various goods in Chongqing has increased significantly. Compared with late March and early March, the transaction volume of mountain goods, medicinal materials, oils and fats and other local products increased by 36% to 78%; the transaction volume of silk fabrics and cotton yarn increased by one to one and a half times. The transaction volume of local product markets in general large and medium-sized counties such as Wanxian and Dazhu in eastern Sichuan exceeded the total amount of February by 20% to 80% in the first and middle ten days of March alone.

    华北物资交流大会将在天津举行
    中南区和西南区正积极促进城乡物资交流
    【本报讯】华北区土产公司召开的土产交流座谈会开幕一星期来，各地公营经济部门和天津市私营工商行业纷纷参加交易，在开展土产交流上起了一定的推动作用。为了进一步加强会议的效果，政务院华北行政委员会决定在土产交流座谈会的基础上，扩大交易范围，举行华北物资交流大会，大力推销农村土产，组织工业品下乡，在“三反”和“五反”运动胜利的基础上，进一步繁荣华北的城乡经济。
    交流大会的会期预定自四月二十一日起至五月十日止。为了扩大物资交流范围，更好地满足各地区、各行业的贸易要求，交流大会除由天津市有关公营经济部门、私营工商行业者参加外，并将邀请华北各地公营经济部门、合作社机构、私营工商业者，以专区、县为单位组成贸易代表团或贸易组来天津参加交易，推销各地农村所存土产，采购各种工业品，以满足广大农村和城市的需要。在交流大会中，并将检查各地区间、各公私企业间在去年所签订的合同和协议的执行情况，加强与建立新的贸易关系。
    交流大会分设：一、土产部，下属工业原料、药材、山干货、糖杂货四组；二、百货部，下属日用百货、五金、布匹三组；三、畜产油脂部，下属猪鬃、皮毛、蛋品、油料、油品四组；四、服务部，下设信托组、人民银行服务组、铁路服务组、电信服务组。
    交流大会设有委员会，作为大会的领导机构，由各有关公营单位和私营工商行业的代表组成，已经政务院华北行政委员会批准成立，并开始在天津市哈尔滨道华北区土产公司内办公。（天津日报消息）
    【新华社汉口十六日电】为活跃城乡国民经济、中南地区有关部门正积极开展城乡物资交流。目前中南区开展城乡物资交流的关键在于全力打开土产销路。中南军政委员会贸易部已指示各地在四月中旬以前召开一次物资交流会议，开展交易活动，解决土产特产滞销问题。湖南省在三月份已抽调一批干部到华北、西北、华东、东北等地，推销了三十多种土产价值四百亿元。该省永明、南县等地贸易公司并组织小贩和购销小组深入农村进行购销工作。江西省国营贸易公司也已派人携带土产样品到华东等地推销。为使交通运输工作配合全区城乡物资交流，中南财政经济委员会曾在三月下旬召开交通运输会议，由郑州、衡阳铁路局、长江航务局和各托运部门研究制订了四月份的运输计划。全区物资交流所需要的铁路、航道运输力量已因此得到保证。
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南各地国营专业公司为配合农村春耕生产，正大力开展土产特产品的收购和物资的供销调运工作。中国油脂公司西南区公司及所属各分支公司，已在西南各地普遍收购桐油，并委托其他国营公司和正当经营的私商代收，许多单位在星期日也照常办公，因而超额完成了原订的收购计划。中国土产公司川西分公司正在川西十多个县收购新上市的药材和土布等产品，并已将大批贝母、川芎、虫草等药材运往汉口、上海、广州及西北地区出售。为了照顾农民的利益，各地土产公司都定出了合理的收购价格。如川西崇庆、双流等县新上市的药材玉京，市价每担曾低到二十万元，当地土产公司收购站即将收购牌价提高到每担二十四万元，因此农民纷纷把玉京卖给土产公司收购站。云南著名的红茶最近开始上市，当地茶业公司除合理提高收购价格外，还派技术干部去教会茶农制选红毛茶的全套技术，并将木制的揉捻机和干燥、发酵等设备贷给茶农，帮助他们精制茶叶。
    与收购同时，各地国营专业公司全面展开物资的供销调运工作。各地粮食公司、土产公司都大量调运粮食、土铁、肥料，适应农民春耕防旱需要。川西区已在三月份以前按时完成了川南、川北等经济作物地区的粮食调运计划，使这些地区的粮价得到稳定。在旱灾较严重的地区，当地粮食公司及时地供应粮食。川北粮食公司并组织农村劳动力参加粮食的调运和加工工作，以解决部分农民的口粮问题。川西、川东等地土产公司，都先后调运了大批肥料供应农民。
    各地国营运输机构也积极改进业务，降低运价，对于城乡物资交流开展起了很大作用。如川西国营运输交通部门在“三反”运动中改进业务，基本上消灭了汽车回空的现象，使运价降低了四分之一。因此，以前不能利用汽车运输的土产特产，现在也用汽车转运了。
    由于各地国营专业公司积极加强收购和推销业务，各地市场呈现活跃气象。重庆市各货的交易量显著上升。以三月下旬和三月上旬比较，山货、药材、油脂等土产交易量增加了百分之三十六到百分之七十八；绸布、花纱等的交易量增加了一倍到一倍半。一般大中县城如川东万县、大竹等地的土产市场交易额，仅三月上、中旬即较二月份全月超过百分之二十到百分之八十。
