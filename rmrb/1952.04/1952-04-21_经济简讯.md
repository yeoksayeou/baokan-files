Economic Briefs

    ▲ In Chongqing, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households in more than ten industries, including silk and cloth, ironwork, and grain, who have been leniently treated, have increased their capital and are actively operating, and production and business have returned to normal development. Among a group of basically law-abiding households in the silk and cloth industry, 24 have voluntarily increased their capital. Rice mills and grain stores that have been leniently treated in the grain milling industry are also actively developing their businesses and purchasing grain to supply the market. Many industrial and commercial households have accepted government commissions to process orders, and the amount of processing orders has gradually increased, reaching 70% of the amount in March in the first ten days of April. In the past, processing orders were mostly monopolized by large households. After the "Five-Anti" struggle, manufacturers and small and medium-sized households with relatively honest business styles have received a large number of orders. The calculation of prices is now more reasonable than before, and the cost of processing orders has generally been reduced by 30%, while the capitalists are still making profits.
    ▲ The Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team, a model of high yield in Sunan Songjiang County that initiated the rice yield increase competition, has started spring plowing early. Songjiang County is a late rice area, and generally does not start cultivating until early May (the Beginning of Summer). Encouraged by patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team completed various preparations for spring plowing before the Qingming Festival and started plowing after the Qingming Festival. In order to fulfill the various guarantees in the letter of challenge, the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team decided to universally promote Chen Yongkang's advanced farming methods within the team. They have agreed with the nearby Songjiang Prefectural Farm to "exchange labor for livestock," renting large water buffalo and new-style walking plows from the farm. This year, the entire team will use the "Laolaiqing" rice seeds cultivated by Chen Yongkang, and will select seeds with salt water before sowing. The mutual aid team has held several brainstorming sessions to study production techniques, researched Chen Yongkang's method of small-plant square close planting and shallow planting of seedlings, and his fertilization experience, and decided to increase the amount of fertilizer applied to each mu of paddy field by 120% this year compared to last year.
    ▲ The spring fishing season on the coast of East China has arrived, and fishermen have recently set sail to sea for fishing. Since last December, the Aquatic Products Bureaus and the People's Banks of East China provinces and regions have successively issued large amounts of fishery production loans to help fishermen repair boats and nets. After the beginning of spring, governments at all levels in coastal areas have held spring fishing work conferences and fishermen representative conferences to specifically solve the problems of supplying food, materials, and marketing fish products to fishermen during the spring fishing season. Aquatic product management institutions at all levels in coastal areas have also been strengthened. Therefore, fishermen in the coastal areas of East China are highly enthusiastic about increasing production. The number of fishing boats going to sea this year in various provinces and regions is higher than last year.
    ▲ In Xilong Township, Qingshen County, Western Sichuan, as many as 33 cattle died from January to March last year, causing great difficulties for spring plowing. After the land reform, the township established a livestock health committee in December last year, and each village established a health team to mobilize the masses to participate in cattle health work, and organized veterinarians to implement the "contracted cattle treatment" method. The method of contracted cattle treatment is for cattle farmers to sign a contract with the village collective and veterinarian (traditional Chinese medicine) for contracted treatment. The contract stipulates that cattle farmers pay the veterinarian three jin of rice per cow per year as remuneration, accept the veterinarian's guidance, and regularly pay attention to cattle hygiene and improve feeding methods. The veterinarian inspects the cattle at least once a month, visiting each household, and provides timely treatment when the cattle are sick. When treating cattle, farmers only pay for medicine (which is cheaper than usual). If either party fails to earnestly fulfill the contract provisions, resulting in the death of cattle, the township people's government will mediate and handle the matter as appropriate. Cattle farmers have also automatically launched a healthy cattle competition between groups and villages. Since the establishment of the Livestock Health Committee, only four of the 782 cattle in the township have died, three of which were old cattle over 20 years old, a decrease of 82.5% compared to the number of cattle that died during the same period last year.
    ▲ In the Western Sichuan area, 32 counties and more than 430 townships, including more than 5 million people, have completed land reform. In order to invest the fruits of the land distributed to the peasants into production, local people's governments and peasant associations used various meetings to educate the peasants to cherish the fruits of the land and use them for production, correcting the idea of a few peasants that "land reform has been carried out, it doesn't matter if we eat and drink a little." After the distribution of the fruits of land reform, governments at all levels paid close attention to preventing waste among farmers. It is estimated that in the more than 430 townships in the Western Sichuan area that have completed land reform, 80% of the fruits of land reform have been used for production.
    ▲ In Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces, the main wheat-producing areas in Northeast China, sowing began in late March, and as of the beginning of this month, most of the wheat fields have been sown. Acheng, Shuangcheng, and Wuchang counties in Songjiang Province, which started plowing earlier, completed wheat sowing before the "Qingming" Festival (April 5); the three counties sowed a total of 32,400 hectares of wheat (each hectare is equal to 15 mu). The wheat fields in Keshan and Zhaodong counties in Heilongjiang Province have now also been completely sown. In the Liaodong Peninsula, which has a warmer climate, the wheat fields are already a lush green. Weeding has begun in the wheat fields in the suburbs of Dalian. This year, the sowing period for spring wheat in various places is generally one week to ten days earlier than in previous years. Farmers in various places have learned from the advanced experience of high-yield models of "early planting and more harvesting," and under the influence of labor models, have broken the traditional rule of "wheat after Qingming (lunar calendar) in March."

    经济简讯
    ▲重庆市绸布、铁作、粮食等十多个行业中已获得宽大处理的中小工商业户，纷纷增加资金，积极经营，生产业务已转入正常发展。绸布业一批基本守法户中，已有二十四户自动增加资金。粮食碾米业中已得到宽大处理的米厂和米行，也积极开展业务，采购粮食供应市场。许多工商业户接受政府委托加工定货的数额已逐渐增加，四月上旬加工定货额已达三月份的百分之七十。过去加工定货多为大户所把持垄断，经过“五反”斗争后，经营作风比较老实的厂商和中小户都得到大批定货。价格的核算已较前合理，加工定货的成本一般降低了百分之三十，而资方仍然有利可图。
    ▲发起水稻增产竞赛的苏南松江县丰产模范陈永康互助组已提早开始春耕。松江县是晚稻地区，一般要到五月初（立夏时）才动手耕地。陈永康互助组在爱国丰产热情鼓舞下，清明节前就做好了各项春耕的准备工作，清明节后就已开始耕地。陈永康互助组为了实现挑战书中的各项保证，决定在组内普遍推行陈永康的先进耕作方法。他们已和附近松江专署农场约定“劳畜换工”，向农场租用大水牛和新式步犁。今年全组都用陈永康培育出来的“老来青”稻种，并在播种前用盐水选种。互助组已开过几次研究生产技术的漫谈会，研究了陈永康的小株方形密植和浅栽的插秧办法和施肥经验，决定今年每亩稻田的施肥量要比去年增加百分之一百二十。
    ▲华东沿海春季大渔汛期已到，渔民近日已扬帆下海捕鱼。华东各省、区的水产局和人民银行，去年十二月以来，就先后发放了大额的渔业生产贷款，帮助渔民修船、修网。入春后，沿海地区各级人民政府都召开过春汛工作会议和渔民代表会议，具体地解决了春汛期间给渔民供应口粮、物资和推销鱼货等问题。沿海各级水产管理机构也加强了。因此，华东沿海渔民增产热情很高。各省区出海的渔船今年都比去年多。
    ▲川西青神县西龙乡去年一月到三月，死牛竟达三十三头，使春耕遭受很大困难。土地改革后，该乡在去年十二月成立了家畜保健委员会，各村成立保健小组，动员群众参加耕牛保健工作，并把兽医组织起来，实行了“包医耕牛”的办法。包医耕牛的办法是由养牛户按村集体和兽医（中医）订立包医合同。合同规定：养牛户每年每头牛给兽医三斤大米做报酬，接受兽医的指导，经常注意耕牛卫生和改善饲养方法。兽医每月至少逐户检查耕牛一次，有病时随请随到，及时医治。医牛时，养牛户只付药费（比一般药低廉）。双方如有一方未认真履行合同规定致使耕牛死亡，由乡人民政府酌情调解处理。养牛的农户还自动展开组与组、村与村的耕牛健康比赛。从家畜保健委员会成立到现在，全乡七百八十二头耕牛只死了四头，其中三头是二十多岁的老牛，较去年同时期死亡牛数减少百分之八十二点五。
    ▲川西区现已有三十二县四百三十多个乡包括五百多万人口的地区完成了土地改革。为将农民分得的果实投入生产，各地人民政府和农民协会，在分配果实的时候，就运用各种会议，教育农民爱惜果实，将果实用于生产，纠正少数农民认为“土地改革了，吃喝点没关系”的思想。分配果实后，各级人民政府又密切注意防止农民发生浪费。据估计川西全区已完成土地改革的四百三十多个乡，百分之八十的果实都用到了生产上。
    ▲东北主要产麦区黑龙江和松江两省，三月下旬就已开始播种，截至本月上旬，大部麦田已经播种完毕。开犁较早的松江省阿城、双城、五常三县，在“清明”节（四月五日）前就已完成种麦；三县共种麦三万二千四百多垧（每垧等于十五市亩）。黑龙江省克山、肇东两县的麦田，现在也已全部种完。气候较暖的辽东半岛地区，麦田已呈一片油绿。旅大市郊的麦田已开始锄草。各地今年春麦播种期，普遍比往年提前了一星期到十天。各地农民在学习了丰产模范“早种多收”的先进经验，并在劳动模范带头的影响下，打破了历来所谓“三月（旧历）清明麦在后”的陈规。
