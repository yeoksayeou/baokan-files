Xinhua News Agency, Oslo: The World Peace Council Executive Bureau held its final meeting on the 1st.

The meeting unanimously adopted an appeal to all men and women of the world entitled "Against Bacteriological Warfare," and adopted a resolution on the current tasks of the peace movement, and suggestions to the Secretariat of the World Peace Council on developing cultural relations between the peoples of the world. With this, the meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council was declared closed.

Xinhua News Agency, Oslo: The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council adopted a general resolution, the contents of which are as follows:

The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council notes that the number of signatures on the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact between the five great powers has reached 600,357,000 to date. This number is 122 million more than the number of signatures on the Stockholm Appeal, and public opinion is increasingly determined to advocate peaceful solutions to problems through negotiation.

This victory underscores the increasingly powerful momentum of the worldwide movement to defend peace and reflects the deepest aspirations of the people. The movement calling for the conclusion of a peace pact must be intensified. The development of this movement can shatter the arms race that is draining the people's strength, damaging their economies, and endangering their independence.

In recent months, the situation has deteriorated. In Asia, bacteriological weapons have been used. Contrary to the wishes of the majority of the German and Japanese people, the rearmament of Japan has become a fait accompli, and the rearmament of West Germany has begun. The struggles of colonial peoples for independence are met with savage repression.

Under these circumstances, the proposals put forward by the Vienna session of the World Peace Council are even more necessary than before as a basis for building peace. These proposals stipulate ending the wars currently underway, eliminating German militarism and unifying Germany, eliminating Japanese militarism, ensuring the restoration of independence to these two countries through peace treaties, and withdrawing foreign troops stationed in Asia, the Near East, and the Middle East.

The persistent activities of the forces of peace have prompted the United Nations to discuss the issue of universal disarmament. This discussion is currently continuing. The Disarmament Commission is currently meeting in New York. The activities of the people of all countries will certainly lead to the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the implementation of gradual, simultaneous, and strictly supervised disarmament. The people of all countries are increasingly feeling the consequences of the policy of war and poverty, and they have also recognized their strength. If they act resolutely, they can change the course of events and conclude a peace pact that ensures the peaceful coexistence of different political and social systems.

In order to more broadly unite all the peace-loving forces of the people, the Executive Bureau decided to convene a meeting of the World Peace Council on June 21, at which a proposal to convene a peace congress this year will be put forward.

    世界和平理事会执行局会议闭幕
    号召世界人民反对细菌战
    决议加紧进行缔结和平公约运动
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社奥斯陆讯：世界和平理事会执行局会议在一日举行最后一次会议。
    会议一致通过了题为“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，并通过了关于和平运动的当前任务的决议，和向世界和平理事会秘书处提出的关于发展世界人民文化关系的建议。至此，世界和平理事会执行局会议宣告闭幕。
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社奥斯陆讯：世界和平理事会执行局会议通过一项总的决议，内容如下：
    世界和平理事会执行局注意到在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的人数，到现在为止已达六亿零三百五十七万。这个数字比在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数还多一亿二千二百万，而且舆论愈来愈坚决主张用谈判方式来和平解决问题。
    这种胜利着重说明了全世界保卫和平运动的日益浩大的声势，并反映了人民的最深切的愿望。要求缔结和平公约的运动必须加紧进行。这个运动的发展可以粉碎消耗人民的力量、破坏他们的经济、危害他们的独立的扩张军备运动。
    在最近数月中，局势已经恶化。在亚洲，细菌武器已被使用。与大多数德国人民和日本人民的愿望相反，武装日本的行动已成为既成事实，武装西德的行动已经开始。殖民地人民争取独立的斗争遇到野蛮的镇压。
    在这种情况下，世界和平理事会维也纳会议所提出的建议，比以前更加是建立和平的必要基础了。这些建议规定结束目前在进行的战争，肃清德国军国主义和统一德国，肃清日本军国主义，以和约来保证恢复这两个国家的独立，撤退驻在亚洲、近东和中东各国的外国军队。
    和平力量的坚持活动，已经促使联合国讨论普遍裁减军备问题。这个讨论目前正在继续进行中。裁减军备委员会现在正在纽约开会。各国人民的活动一定会使具有大规模毁灭性的武器得以禁止，并使逐步、同时和有严格监督的裁减军备得以实行。各国人民愈来愈感觉到战争和贫穷政策的后果，他们也已认识到他们的力量。如果他们坚决行动起来，他们就能够改变事物发展的方向，能够缔结一个确保不同的政治与社会制度和平共存的和平公约。
    为了更广泛地团结一切人民的、爱好和平的力量，执行局决定在六月二十一日召开一次世界和平理事会会议，在会上提出在今年召开和平大会的建议。
