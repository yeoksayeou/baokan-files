Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 26th: The German people are very concerned about the developments in New China. All democratic newspapers in Berlin have published news about China's price reductions. "Neues Deutschland" published this news on the 18th, along with news of the recent signing of the 1952 trade agreement between China and the Soviet Union in Moscow. "Berliner Zeitung" published the news of the price reductions on its front page. The Free Democratic Party's newspaper, "Der Morgen," also published the news, with the headline: "Prices Greatly Reduced in People's China."

The German people are also very interested in news about water conservancy projects in New China. Democratic newspapers in Berlin and progressive newspapers in West Germany have published news about the spring repairs of dykes on the Yellow River. These newspapers vividly contrasted China's water control projects with the recent floods on the Missouri River in the United States. An article in the "Hamburger Volkszeitung" on the 22nd stated: "China has many rivers that have frequently flooded for thousands of years. No government has ever been able to control these rivers before. But only one year after the Chinese people were liberated, the Huai River was being harnessed. This huge construction project was made possible by the new government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and by the increased political awareness of the Chinese people... Now, millions of people in the United States are suffering from the floods on the Missouri River. Although American imperialism spends billions of dollars on producing atomic bombs in Texas, it does not spend money on flood control. The American government sends a few soldiers with sandbags to block the breached dykes, while large numbers of new recruits are being sent to Korea and West Germany, where cities and villages have been completely destroyed." The "Freie Volkszeitung," published in Düsseldorf, commented on the situation of the Missouri River floods on the 21st, saying: "The situation is completely different in the People's Republic of China. In China, the people are repairing river dykes with mechanical tools that are not yet highly developed, not to mention the huge construction projects in the Soviet Union."

    对我国减低物价和水利工程建设
    德国人民都表示关切
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】德国人民非常关心新中国的动态。柏林各民主报纸全都刊登了中国减低物价的消息。“新德意志报”在十八日刊载了这个消息，同时并刊载了中苏两国最近在莫斯科签订一九五二年贸易议定书的消息。“柏林日报”在头版刊登了减低物价的消息。自由民主党机关报“晨报”也刊载了这个消息，标题是：“人民中国各地物价大为降低”。
    德国人民对新中国水利工程的消息也很感兴趣。柏林民主报纸和西德的进步报纸都刊载了黄河春季整修堤坝的消息。这些报纸把中国的治水工程和美国密苏里河最近的水灾作了生动的对比。“汉堡人民日报”二十二日刊载一篇论文说：“中国有许多在数千年来就时常泛滥成灾的河流。以前从未有任何政府能够治理这些河流。但在中国人民获得解放后只有一年的功夫，淮河就进行修治了。由于在中国共产党领导下的新政府，由于中国人民政治觉悟的提高，这种巨大建设工程的进行才成为可能……现在，美国有上百万人民受密苏里河泛滥之苦。美国帝国主义虽花费数十亿美元在得克萨斯州生产原子弹，但它却不花钱防治水灾。美国政府派少数兵士用沙袋来堵塞决口的堤坝，而大批新兵却正被派往城市和乡村全被破坏了的朝鲜和西德。”在杜塞尔多夫出版的“自由人民”报于二十一日在评论密苏里河水灾情况后说：“在中华人民共和国，情况就完全不同。在中国，人民正以还不是很高度发展的机械工具来整修河堤，更不用说苏联的巨大建设工程了。”
