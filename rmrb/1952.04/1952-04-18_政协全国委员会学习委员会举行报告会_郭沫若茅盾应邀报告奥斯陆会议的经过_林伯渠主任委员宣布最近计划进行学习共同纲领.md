Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The Study Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a report meeting in Beijing at 2:30 p.m. on the 17th, inviting Guo Moruo and Mao Dun, representatives of China who recently participated in the World Peace Council Executive Bureau meeting held in Oslo, to give reports. Those present included: Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, members of the National Committee in Beijing, central committee members of various democratic parties in Beijing, non-party democratic人士, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, religious circles, and people's organizations, totaling more than 200 people.

Guo Moruo reported on the proceedings of the World Peace Council Executive Bureau meeting, pointing out that the Executive Bureau meeting was held against the background of the American aggressors conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and therefore was of great significance. The Chinese delegation exposed the monstrous crimes of the American imperialists at the meeting and suggested that the World Peace Council organize a commission of inquiry into American crimes. This proposal was adopted by the Executive Bureau meeting as a whole, and a letter to men and women all over the world entitled "Oppose Bacteriological Warfare" was also adopted, calling on people all over the world to rise up to stop bacteriological warfare in order to save the fate of mankind. Guo Moruo emphasized that if all peace-loving people in the world unite and fight together, they will surely defeat the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors.

Mao Dun then reported on the process and significance of the Executive Bureau meeting's discussion of the issues of German and Japanese militarization and national sovereignty.

At the meeting, Lin Boqu, director of the Study Committee, announced the recent study plan. He pointed out that since the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC called for a broad ideological remolding movement, people from all walks of life across the country have responded enthusiastically. The study movement in the past period has achieved considerable results, but it is still necessary to expand it more widely in the future. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, people from all walks of life, especially those in the industrial and commercial sectors, deeply felt the need to further and correctly understand the policies. Therefore, the Study Committee decided to conduct a study of the Common Program in the study seminars. In addition to understanding the basic content of the policies, participants in the study must also appropriately connect the theoretical basis and actual situation of various policies, and link them with the study of Mao Zedong Thought, in order to improve the level of understanding of theoretical policies.

    政协全国委员会学习委员会举行报告会
    郭沫若茅盾应邀报告奥斯陆会议的经过
    林伯渠主任委员宣布最近计划进行学习共同纲领
    【新华社十七日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会，十七日下午二时半在北京举行报告会，邀请最近参加在奥斯陆召开的世界和平理事会执行局会议的我国代表郭沫若、茅盾作报告。到会的有：中国人民政协全国委员会副主席李济深、陈叔通，在京的全国委员会委员，以及各民主党派在京中央委员、无党派民主人士、工商界人士、宗教界人士，和人民团体代表二百余人。
    郭沫若在会上报告了世界和平理事会执行局会议的经过，他指出：执行局会议是在美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的情况下召开的，因此意义很重大。中国代表团在会上揭发了美帝国主义者的滔天罪行，并建议世界和平理事会组织一个美国罪行的调查委员会。这个建议已由执行局会议全体通过，并通过了题为“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，号召全世界人民起来制止细菌战，以挽救人类的命运。郭沫若强调说：全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来共同斗争，必能战胜美国侵略者所进行的细菌战。
    茅盾接着报告了执行局会议讨论德国和日本军国主义化、民族主权问题的经过及意义。
    会上学习委员会主任委员林伯渠宣布了最近的学习计划。他指出：自从政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议号召广泛展开思想改造运动以来，全国各界人士纷纷响应。过去一个时期的学习运动已取得了不少成绩，但今后仍须更广泛地展开。在“三反”和“五反”运动中，各界人士尤其是工商界人士深感有进一步正确了解政策的必要。因此，学习委员会决定在学习座谈会中进行共同纲领的学习。参加学习者除须理解政策的基本内容外，还须适当地联系各项政策的理论根据和实际情况，联系学习毛泽东思想，以提高理论政策的认识水平。
