Following the Central Committee for Thrift Examination's "Several Regulations on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors," which were approved and issued by the Government Administration Council, the "Three-Anti" struggle in various regions and units has generally entered the stage of handling problems. This stage of the struggle is the decisive stage in determining whether the "Three-Anti" struggle can achieve complete victory. One of the most arduous tasks at this stage is the work of追赃定案 (pursuing赃 and finalizing cases) for corrupt elements. The Central Committee for Thrift Examination's "Several Regulations on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" has powerfully promoted the confession, meritorious service, and active return of赃 by corrupt elements. In general regions and units, due to the correct grasp and application of this weapon, the anti-corruption struggle has deepened, and the work of 追赃定案 has also achieved significant victories. However, this struggle is not yet over. Many corrupt elements, especially major corrupt officials, are still stubbornly resisting, attempting to muddle through. Many corrupt elements who have already confessed or admitted their crimes are unwilling to reveal the whereabouts of their赃款 and赃物, and are unwilling to honestly return the赃. They stubbornly insist, "There is no赃 left, it's all spent." Some put on a pitiful act, trying to gain sympathy and concessions from others; others shamelessly act like rascals, refusing to return赃, or secretly dispersing, concealing, or even squandering and destroying 赃款 and 赃物. All of this shows that the work of 追赃定案 is still an arduous and complex struggle, and we cannot allow ourselves to relax in the slightest.

Now, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has also promulgated the Central Committee for Thrift Examination's "Regulations on Confiscating赃款 and赃物 from Corrupt Elements" (see the first page of yesterday's newspaper), which gives all regions a new and powerful weapon in the work of 追赃定案. According to this document, we will, on the basis of strictly enforcing national laws and regulations, handle the赃款 and 赃物 of corrupt elements differently according to different circumstances. The so-called different circumstances are: the attitude of confession, the severity of the corruption, whether there are actual difficulties in returning赃, and so on. But the most important thing is to see whether the corrupt element's attitude towards returning赃 is honest and active. This document stipulates: "Corrupt elements who admit their crimes of corruption and voluntarily hand over赃款 and赃物 and sincerely express remorse may be given a lighter punishment at the discretion of the court; corrupt elements who have admitted their crimes of corruption but deliberately conceal, refuse to hand over, or disperse and destroy赃款 and赃物 shall be given a heavier punishment at the discretion of the court." This spirit is also reflected in several other clauses. Why is this stipulated in this way? This is because: whether or not one honestly and actively returns贓款 and 赃物 is an important manifestation of whether a corrupt element is truly confessing and has sincere remorse. If there is赃 but it is not returned, it proves that they have not yet awakened ideologically, have no remorse, still want to continue to encroach on state property, and continue to live a corrupt and decadent bourgeois life. If these hateful elements are not given a heavier punishment, it will not be possible to ensure that national laws and regulations will not be further undermined by them, that state property will not be further encroached upon by them, and that the anger of the masses will not be appeased.

In the current struggle, there is a very harmful tendency, which is that some of the commanders of the anti-corruption struggle are unconditionally accommodating and pitying corrupt elements, showing weakness and incompetence, and unable to lead the masses in a tenacious battle. As soon as they see the huge amount of corruption, they worry about the corrupt elements, fearing that they will not be able to return so much, fearing that their lives will be difficult after returning贓, fearing that the pursuit of赃 will cause chaos, and fearing that the pursuit will cause the corrupt elements to retract their confessions. Without detailed investigation and research, they arbitrarily reduce or exempt the贓款 and赃物 that corrupt elements should return. They emphasize that these corrupt elements "behaved well" and should be "taken care of." This unserious and irresponsible attitude makes many corrupt elements feel that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, and they become more arrogant and shameless in denying and resisting; the masses are indignant, complaining about the leadership, and slackening their fighting spirit. If this situation is not changed, the victorious achievements already obtained in the anti-corruption struggle will be in danger of being ruined.

Among these people, some originally had a strong right-leaning ideology, underestimated the "enemy situation," and underestimated the serious significance of the "Three-Anti" struggle; later, under the urging of superiors and the masses, they were forced to rise up and command the battle, but their attitude has always been irresolute and unenthusiastic. They lack the due hatred for corruption and even hold unprincipled sympathy, and they are indifferent to state property and the interests of the people. Therefore, at every opportunity, they consciously or unconsciously reduce or exonerate corrupt elements, seeking convenient loopholes. In addition, some people have not seriously studied the regulations of the Central Committee for Thrift Examination and grasped their essence, and one-sidedly and wrongly believe that "as long as lenient treatment is given, it is correct," and thus adopt an extremely wrong attitude of "rather be right than left." They intentionally or unintentionally interpret and implement the regulations on "酌退贪污款物 (discretionary return of embezzled funds and materials)" and "尽可能追缴贪污款物 (recover embezzled funds and materials as much as possible)" to the right, actually becoming "尽可能不追不退 (try not to pursue and not to return as much as possible)." They do not understand that so-called confession and meritorious service should include honestly handing over赃款 and 赃物. If a corrupt element has remorse, he should honestly hand over the property he has shamefully stolen. If they don't even have this honest attitude, how can they be considered confessing and performing meritorious service? How can they receive lenient treatment? The spirit of the Central People's Government in handling corruption cases has long been made very clear, that is, "combining strictness and leniency, combining transformation and punishment," the purpose of which is to strive for "the complete completion of the tasks of the anti-corruption and anti-embezzlement struggle," "eliminate the filth of the old society, and establish a clean and simple atmosphere in the new society," and "strictly enforce national laws and regulations." However, can such a goal be achieved according to the above-mentioned commanders' approach? Obviously not. That approach can only condone corruption, promote corruption, and destroy national laws and regulations!

In order to correctly implement the spirit of the central documents, strive for the complete victory of the anti-corruption struggle, in order to recover the losses of the country and strictly enforce the national laws and regulations, we must fight against this right-leaning ideological sentiment and resolutely correct it, so as to clear the way for the work of 追赃定案. Anyone who insists on their mistakes and refuses to correct them should be considered to be hindering the movement and should be criticized or appropriately punished immediately to purify the fighting headquarters; their mistakes should not be condoned, allowing them to damage the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement.

The process of carrying out the work of 追赃定案 must be a process of continuing to mobilize the masses and persist in the struggle. Only by mobilizing the masses to seriously investigate, calculate accounts, and carefully verify the sources and destinations of赃款 and 赃物, and grasp the true evidence, can corrupt elements have no opportunity to take advantage of. Those masses who have a lax and disorganized mood should be given in-depth education to make them realize the serious significance of this struggle, reorganize their ranks, and improve their fighting spirit. Corrupt elements should be solemnly told that not returning赃 proves that they have no sincerity to repent and have not broken ties with the bourgeois ideas of enjoyment and corruption. Not returning赃 is continuing to engage in corruption and continuing to commit crimes. If they are obsessed and do not wake up, they will not only not be given lenient treatment, but will also be given a heavier punishment. Their only way out now is to thoroughly confess, honestly return赃, and perform meritorious service to redeem themselves. Those who change their attitude and honestly return赃 after mobilization should be given lenient treatment as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations; those who still insist on refusing to return赃 after mobilization should be resolutely punished with the punishment they deserve, and there should be no hesitation or wavering. This treatment should be carried out in the form of a conference to expand the impact, promote other corrupt elements to quickly return赃, and save all those who can be saved.

In carrying out this struggle, all possible forces should be organized and used. The vast majority of corrupt elements who have confessed and returned赃 and the family members and relatives of corrupt elements who refuse to confess and return赃 are all forces that can be used. Many facts have proven that as long as these people are told clearly about the policies and pointed out the way out, they can play a great role in pursuing贓. After the贓款 and贓物 have been verified to be accurate, they should be concluded quickly after procedures such as personal signing, mass review, and leadership approval, as a basis for finalization, and handled separately. In the process of handling, we should resolutely oppose the bad style of not allowing the masses to discuss, being subjectively arbitrary, not following policies, not analyzing the situation, and making conclusions and handling them arbitrarily. We must emphasize the style of close integration between leaders and the masses in the handling process, so that the handling work can be completed smoothly.

### 分别不同情况做好追赃定案工作

    分别不同情况做好追赃定案工作
    中央节约检查委员会“关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”经政务院批准发布以后，各地区和各单位的“三反”斗争一般地进入了处理问题的阶段。这一阶段的斗争，是“三反”斗争能否获得全胜的决定性的阶段。这一阶段的最艰巨任务之一，是对贪污分子的追赃定案工作。中央节约检查委员会“关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”，有力地推动了贪污分子的坦白、立功和积极退赃。一般地区和单位，由于正确地掌握和运用了这一武器，反贪污斗争更加深入，追赃定案工作也取得了重大的胜利。但是，这一斗争现在并未完结。不少的贪污分子，尤其是大贪污犯，还在负隅顽抗，企图蒙混过去。有许多已经坦白或供认了自己罪行的贪污分子，还不肯说出赃款赃物的去路，不愿意老老实实地退赃。他们一口咬定说：“没赃了，花光了。”有的装可怜相，想骗取别人的同情和让步；有的恬不知耻地耍无赖，不肯退赃，或暗地里分散、隐匿、甚至挥霍、销毁赃款赃物。这些都说明追赃定案仍然是一个艰苦复杂的斗争，不容许我们稍有松懈。
    现在中央人民政府政务院又公布了中央节约检查委员会“关于追缴贪污分子赃款赃物的规定”（见昨日本报第一版），这就给了各地在追赃定案工作中以一个新的强有力的武器。根据这个文件，我们将在严肃国家法纪的原则基础上，分别不同情况，对于贪污分子的赃款赃物做不同的处理。所谓不同的情况就是：坦白态度好坏、贪污情节是否严重恶劣、退赃有无实际困难等等。但是最重要的是要看贪污分子对退赃所抱的态度是否老实，是否积极。这个文件规定：“贪污分子承认贪污罪行，而又自动交出贪污款物、真诚表示悔过者，得酌量减轻处罚；贪污分子虽已承认贪污罪行，但故意隐瞒、拒不交出或分散破坏贪污款物者，应酌情加重处罚。”这种精神，还体现在其他若干条款中。为什么要这样规定呢？这是因为：能否老实地、积极地退出赃款赃物，乃是贪污分子是否真正坦白和有无悔过诚意的重要表现。如果有赃不退，就证明他们在思想上至今毫无觉悟，毫无悔祸之心，仍然想继续侵夺国家财产，继续过资产阶级腐化堕落的生活。对于这些可恶的分子如果不予以加重的处罚，就不能保证国家法纪不再被他们所破坏，就不能保证国家财产不再被他们所侵吞，而且也不能平息群众的愤怒。
    在当前的斗争中，有一种非常有害的倾向，这就是有一部分反贪污斗争的指挥人员，无原则地迁就和怜悯贪污分子，表现了软弱无能，不能领导群众进行顽强的战斗。他们一看见贪污数目巨大，就替贪污分子发愁，怕他们退不出这么多，怕他们退赃后生活发生困难，怕追赃会追出乱子，怕追得贪污分子翻了供。他们不经详细调查研究，就任意地减免贪污分子应退的赃物赃款。他们强调这些贪污分子“表现好”，应该“照顾”。这种不严肃、不认真的态度，使许多贪污分子觉得有机可乘，更加嚣张、无耻地抵赖和顽抗；群众则愤愤不平，埋怨领导，松懈了斗志。这种情形如不改变，反贪污斗争中已经获得的胜利成果，就将有被断送的危险。
    这些人中间，有些原来就有浓厚的右倾思想，对“敌情”估计不足，对“三反”斗争的严重意义估计不足；后来在上级和群众的督促之下，他们被迫地起而指挥战斗，但态度一直是不坚决、不积极的。他们对贪污行为缺乏应有的仇恨心，甚至抱着无原则的同情，对国家财产和人民的利益则漠不关心。因此，一有机会，他们就自觉地或不自觉地为贪污分子减轻或开脱罪责，找寻方便之门。另外有一些人，是对中央节约检查委员会的规定没有认真研究和掌握它的精神实质，而片面地错误地认为“只要宽大处理就对”，因而采取了“宁右勿左”的极端错误的态度。他们对于“酌退贪污款物”和“尽可能追缴贪污款物”的规定，有意无意地向右的方面加以解释和执行，实际成了“尽可能不追不退”。他们不懂得所谓坦白、立功，应该包括老老实实交出赃款赃物在内。贪污分子如果有悔祸之心，就应该把自己可耻地偷窃所得的财物老老实实交出来。如果连这点老实态度都没有，还算什么坦白和立功呢？又怎能受到宽大处理呢？中央人民政府处理贪污案件的精神，早已说得很清楚，这就是“严肃与宽大相结合，改造与惩治相结合”，其目的是争取“反贪污、反盗窃斗争任务的彻底完成”，“肃清旧社会的污毒，树立新社会廉洁朴素的风气”，“严肃国家法纪”。然而依照上述指挥人员的那种做法，能不能达到这样的目的呢？显然是不能的。那种做法只能放纵贪污，助长贪污，毁坏国家法纪！
    为了正确地贯彻中央文件的精神，争取反贪污斗争的彻底胜利，为了挽回国家的损失，严肃国家的法纪，我们必须向这种右倾的思想情绪作斗争，坚决予以纠正，为追赃定案工作扫清道路。谁如果坚持错误，不肯改正，就应该被认为是阻碍运动的，应即予以批评或适当的处分，以纯洁战斗的指挥部；不应该宽纵他们的错误，任凭他们来损害“三反”运动所已得的胜利。
    进行追赃定案工作的过程，必须是继续发动群众坚持斗争的过程。只有发动群众认真调查、算账、细密对证赃款赃物的来源和去路，掌握真凭实据，才能使贪污分子无隙可乘。部分群众中有松懈涣散情绪的，应该对他们进行深入的教育，使他们认识这个斗争的严重意义，重整队伍，提高斗志。对贪污分子应该郑重说明：有赃不退，就证明他们没有悔改的诚意，没有和资产阶级的享乐腐化思想割断关系。有赃不退，就是在继续贪污，继续犯罪。如果执迷不悟，他们不仅不能得到宽大的处理，还要加重治罪。他们现在的唯一出路，就是彻底坦白，老实退赃，立功自赎。经动员后改变态度、老实退赃的，应尽快根据规定，给予从宽处理；动员后仍然坚持不肯退赃的，应该果断地处以应得之罪，不应犹豫动摇。这种处理应该以大会方式进行，以扩大影响，推动其他贪污分子迅速退赃，挽救一切可能被挽救的分子。
    在进行这个斗争中，应该组织和使用一切可能的力量。大部分已经坦白退赃的贪污分子和拒不坦白退赃的贪污分子的家属、亲友，都是可供使用的力量。许多事实已经证明，只要向这些人讲清政策，指明出路，他们是能够在追赃中起很大作用的。赃款赃物对证确凿之后，应该经过本人具结，群众审查，领导批准等手续，迅速做出结论，作为定案，分别处理。处理中应该坚决反对那种不让群众讨论、主观独断、不依据政策、不分析情况而随意做结论、随意处理的恶劣作风。我们必须强调在处理过程中领导和群众密切结合的作风，使处理工作顺利完成。
