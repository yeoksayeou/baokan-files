Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Paris "Tonight" reporter Béquet reported from Kaesong on the 16th: Up to the 16th, the U.S. side had neither discussed nor answered General Xie Fang's speech for solving the third agenda item for fourteen consecutive days. Only under increasing pressure from public opinion will the U.S. side be forced to take the final steps necessary for a ceasefire. Their deliberate obstruction of negotiations and perverse actions show that they are indifferent to the progress of the negotiations. They believe that in this way, the public will not know their absurd claims that have brought the negotiations to a standstill.

The U.S. side has hypocritically said that their insistence on "voluntary repatriation" is due to concern for the well-being of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; however, this hypocritical attitude was once again exposed on the 16th. According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 16th, according to an agreement between two U.S. puppets—Yoshida and Syngman Rhee—all Korean residents in Japan who are considered "elements that endanger the peace and security of Japan" will be forcibly repatriated to the hands of the Syngman Rhee government. The words "forced repatriation" are used here. An article published in the "New York Times" on April 7th even more horrifyingly confirms the hypocritical attitude of the U.S. side. According to an article written by Barrett, the newspaper's reporter on the front line: The U.S. side now wants to slander the Korean and Chinese troops on the front line as "traitors" who betrayed the Korean and Chinese authorities, hoping that they will be arrested and executed. This kind of activity is carried out under the guise of "psychological" warfare. According to Barrett, the actual situation is this: The U.S. side forces captured Korean and Chinese soldiers to tell the names of other personnel in their units, and then writes letters to these personnel separately, with photos of the prisoners attached. These letters are dropped from the air or launched with propaganda shells. The letter says: "Your comrade has told us your name, and he told us that you want to surrender." Then it describes the method of surrender. According to Barrett, who stayed in the war zone facing the Chinese army's positions: "This is done to give the Chinese army two choices: surrender or be tried by the Communist authorities—and perhaps sentenced to death; if the recipient does not come to the United Nations forces' front line within ten days, their name will be reported to the Communist authorities." When the ten-day deadline expires, the U.S. side broadcasts to the recipient again, giving him two more hours to consider, and if he does not surrender, he will be exposed.

For many months, the fourth agenda item meeting has been in a stalemate because the U.S. side refuses to release all prisoners of war. The U.S. side tells the world: They cannot hand over Korean prisoners of war casually—they may be handed over to the "execution squad"; in fact, they have used all kinds of threats to make the prisoners of war become traitors. Now the U.S. side has dropped its mask, showing that the deliberate policy they have adopted on the front line is to use tricks to hand over thousands of Korean and Chinese troops to the U.S. "execution squad," the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs. In fact, the Korean and Chinese authorities have made it very clear that they are aware of this U.S. trick. This incident once again proves that the U.S. methods of conducting war and negotiations have exhausted their shamelessness and barbarism. Only the just voice of the world can force the U.S. side to take the necessary steps to end the negotiations and end the war.

    美方处心积虑阻挠谈判是想玩弄卑鄙无耻诡计
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十六日自开城报道：到十六日为止，美方一连十四天既不肯讨论、也不肯答复解方将军为了解决第三项议程而作的发言。只有在舆论增加压力的情况下，美方才会被迫采取停战所必需的最后步骤。他们处心积虑地阻挠谈判，倒行逆施，这说明他们对谈判的进展是漠不关心的。他们认为这样一来公众就不会知道他们所持的那种使谈判陷入僵局的荒谬主张。
    美方曾假惺惺地说，他们之所以坚持“自愿遣返”是由于关心中朝战俘的幸福；可是这种伪善的态度在十六日又一次被揭露了。据十六日的东京消息说，根据两个美国傀儡——吉田和李承晚——的协议，被视为“危害日本和平与治安的分子”的全体旅日朝鲜侨民，将被强迫遣返到李承晚政府的手里。这里用了“强迫遣返”这样的字样。四月七日的“纽约时报”上刊载的一篇文章，更加骇人听闻地证实美方的伪善态度。据在前线的该报记者巴瑞特所写的一篇文章说：美方现在想诬蔑在前线上的朝中军队是背叛朝中当局的“叛徒”，希望他们被逮捕处决。这种勾当是在“心理”战的幌子下干的。据巴瑞特说，实际情况是这样的：美方强迫被俘的朝中士兵说出他们的部队的其他人员的姓名，然后分别写信给这些人员，并附上俘虏的照片。这种信件是从空中投下的，或者是用宣传弹发射出去的。信里说：“你的同志已把你的名字告诉了我们，他告诉我们说你想投降。”接着就述说投降的办法。据呆在和中国军队的阵地相对峙的战区中的巴瑞特说：“这样做是为了给中国军队两种选择：投降或者受共产党当局的审判——也许还会被判处死刑；如果收信人不在十天以内到联合国军战线来，就把他们的姓名告知共产党当局。”在十天的期限完毕的时候，美方又向收信人广播，再给他两小时考虑，如不投降，即予揭发。
    许多月以来，第四项议程会议一直陷入僵局，原因是美方不肯释放全部战俘。美方对全世界说：他们不能随便交出朝鲜俘虏——也许会交到“执刑队”手里；其实他们已用尽一切威胁手段，想使战俘成为叛徒。现在美方已放下假面具，表明他们在前线采取的处心积虑的政策是想用诡计把成千上万的朝中军队交到美方的“执刑队”蒋介石李承晚匪帮手里。其实朝中当局已说得十分清楚，他们是洞悉这种美国诡计的。这件事又一次证明美方进行战争和谈判的方法都已极尽无耻和野蛮之能事。只有全世界的正义呼声，才能迫使美方采取必要的步骤来结束谈判和终止战争。
