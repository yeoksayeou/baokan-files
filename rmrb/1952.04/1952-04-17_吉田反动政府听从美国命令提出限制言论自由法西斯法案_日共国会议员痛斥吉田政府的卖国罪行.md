Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Tokyo News: While formulating the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," the Yoshida reactionary government passed another fascist bill, the "Special Criminal Law Bill," in the cabinet meeting on March 28th, and immediately submitted it to the Diet for deliberation.

The so-called "Special Criminal Law Bill" is a repressive bill to ensure the implementation of the aggressive US-Japan "Administrative Agreement." According to Kyodo News, it was formulated based on the "Administrative Agreement" to "protect the secrets and security of the American garrison," and anyone deemed to have violated this bill will be subject to severe penalties. Particularly insidious in the bill are the clauses concerning the so-called protection of "military secrets." Kyodo News admits that such clauses "may restrict freedom of speech and the press."

The evil consequences of the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" are gradually emerging. The "Special Criminal Law Bill," which deprives the Japanese people of their freedom, is only one of them.
Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Group issued a statement on March 28th, firmly opposing the "Special Criminal Law Bill." The statement listed the reasons for opposition as follows:

First, this bill, under the guise of Far East peace and security, is an attempt by the US government to use Japan's territory and people as tools to implement its war policy of "blocking China and the Soviet Union" and to enforce the "Administrative Agreement" it coerced Japan into signing. In implementing this bill, all words and deeds that violate American interests will be punished with heavy penalties. Second, we know that under the Tojo military clique, many anti-war peace fighters and upright citizens were deprived of their freedom and suppressed under the "National Defense Security Law" and the "Military Secrets Protection Law." Third, we also know that under the occupation, there have been thousands of patriotic people struggling for peace, independence, and freedom who have been arrested and imprisoned for the crimes of obstructing the security of the US military and violating the occupation policy. Recently, seven workers, including Iida Shichizo, were accused of espionage for possessing maps issued by the Ministry of Construction; also, workers working at the US military's Yokohama 229th unit were considered to have leaked US military secrets when they requested wage increases, citing increased production as a reason. Both of these incidents were tried by military tribunals. Fourth, based on the above, it is clear that this bill is a treasonous bill that suppresses all national liberation patriotic movements opposing the American occupation system and the Yoshida government, which oppress the Japanese people. This is a malicious bill that is several times more tyrannical than the previous "Public Order Maintenance Law."

The statement concluded by emphasizing: We demand peace, independence, and freedom. We will fight together with the Japanese people to smash this bill.

    吉田反动政府听从美国命令提出限制言论自由法西斯法案
    日共国会议员痛斥吉田政府的卖国罪行
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：在制订“防止破坏活动法案”的同时，吉田反动政府在三月二十八日的内阁会议中又通过了另一个法西斯法案——“刑事特别法案”，并立即提交国会审议。
    所谓“刑事特别法案”，是为了保证侵略性的美日“行政协定”得以实行的镇压性的法案。据共同社透露，它是根据“行政协定”为了“保护美国驻军的机密和安全”而制订的，凡被认为违反这个法案者，都将受到重刑的处罚。法案中特别恶毒的是关于所谓保护“军事机密”的条款，共同社承认：这类条款“可能限制言论、新闻的自由”。
    美日“行政协定”的恶果，正在陆续地产生出来，剥夺日本人民的自由的“刑事特别法案”，不过是其中之一而已。
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团在三月二十八日发表声明，坚决反对“刑事特别法案”。声明列举反对的理由如下：
    一、这个法案是美国政府假借远东和平与安全的名义，企图把日本的领土和国民全都作为实行“封锁中国与苏联”的战争政策的工具，实施强制日本签订的“行政协定”；而在实行这个法案的时候，将以重刑处罚违反美国利益的一切言行。二、我们知道，在东条军阀手里，许多反战的和平斗士和正派的市民因为“国防保安法”、“保护军机法”而被剥夺了自由，受到了镇压。三、我们也知道，在占领之下，有数千为争取和平、独立、自由而斗争的爱国人士，以妨碍美军的安全、违反占领政策的罪名而被逮捕和投入监狱的现实事例。最近，以饭田七三等七名工人持有建设省发行的地图等为理由，对他们加上了间谍的污名；还有，在美军横滨第二二九部队工作的工人在要求增加工资时，提出生产量已经增加作为理由，因此就被认为是泄漏美军的机密。这两个事件都由军事法庭审判了。四、根据上述，可以明白：这个法案是压制一切反对欺压日本国民的美国占领制度和吉田政府的民族解放爱国运动的卖国法案。这是比从前的“维持治安法”还要暴虐几倍的恶毒法案。
    声明最后强调说：我们要求和平、独立和自由。我们将和日本人民共同奋斗，一定要粉碎这个法案。
