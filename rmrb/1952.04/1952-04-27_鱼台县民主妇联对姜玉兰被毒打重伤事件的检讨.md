    Yutai County Democratic Women's Federation's Self-Criticism Regarding the Jiang Yulan Assault and Serious Injury Incident
    Editor: The letter "The Yutai County Democratic Women's Federation of Pingyuan Province Should Resolutely Protect Women's Interests," published in the People's Daily on April 10th, is of great help to our future work.
    Jiang Yulan, a woman from Liutianpu Village in our county, came to our county Women's Federation after being granted a divorce from Ma Yuxiang by the County People's Government's Judicial Section, requesting assistance in resolving post-divorce issues. In order to "take care" of the "reactions" of a small number of backward masses, we actually introduced Jiang Yulan to the Second District Women's Federation of our county, and finally let her return to Liutianpu Village, resulting in her being severely injured by the criminal Ma Yuxiang. The occurrence of this incident is fundamentally due to our insufficient concern for women's vital issues and insufficient consideration for Jiang Yulan's suffering, which led to our failure to properly handle this matter. It is even more inexcusable that this incident occurred nearly two years after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. We have learned a great lesson from this incident. In addition to suggesting that the government severely punish the criminal Ma Yuxiang, we will make our utmost efforts to protect women's legitimate interests in the future.
    The above is our initial self-examination. We hope readers will continue to help us.
    Yutai County Democratic Women's Federation, Pingyuan Province

### 鱼台县民主妇联对姜玉兰被毒打重伤事件的检讨

    鱼台县民主妇联对姜玉兰被毒打重伤事件的检讨
    编辑同志：四月十日人民日报发表的“平原省鱼台县民主妇联应当坚决保护妇女利益”一信，对我们今后的工作有很大帮助。
    我县刘田铺村妇女姜玉兰，经县人民政府司法科判准和马玉祥离婚后，曾到我们县妇联来，请求帮助解决离婚后的问题。我们为了“照顾”少数落后群众的“反应”，竟介绍姜玉兰到本县二区妇联，最后又让她回刘田铺村，致被马犯玉祥毒打重伤。这一事件的发生，基本上是由于我们对妇女的切身问题关心不够，对姜玉兰的痛苦体贴不够，而没有适当处理这件事所造成的。这一事件发生在婚姻法颁布将近二年之后，是更不应该的。我们从这一事件中，得到很大的教训。我们除了建议政府严惩马犯玉祥之外，今后决为保护妇女正当利益尽最大的努力。
    以上是我们的初步检查。希望读者继续帮助我们。
    平原省鱼台县民主妇女联合会
