Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 21st: A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Korean People's Army shot down ninety-six enemy planes in the seven months leading up to the end of February. Eight hundred and thirty-nine warriors emerged, who were awarded various medals and decorations for their outstanding combat achievements. Furthermore, Li Xuexiang, Li Zhongzhu, and Park Chunji were honored with the glorious title of "Hero of the Republic."

This anti-aircraft artillery unit, like other units of the Korean People's Army, has grown stronger and stronger in the great war against the American aggressors, and has been forged into a heroic unit. Led by members of the Korean Workers' Party and the Democratic Youth League, the soldiers regularly summarize combat experience and conduct political studies. Driven by revolutionary heroism and patriotism, they study diligently in combat, constantly improving their combat skills, and achieving greater and greater results. On February 5th of this year, the unit was awarded the glorious title of "Guards Unit." In the subsequent month, the warriors created an unprecedented record of shooting down thirty-nine enemy planes.

On the morning of July 30th of last year, over a hundred enemy planes raided the position of the Kim Young-soo squadron. The crazed enemy planes dropped large quantities of bombs and incendiary bombs on the villages near the position. Explosions sounded continuously, and smoke and fire enveloped the area. However, the warriors of the Kim Young-soo squadron calmly used fierce artillery fire to shoot at the enemy planes. Squad leader Zhao Quanyuan fought tirelessly in the air amidst the dust and flying shrapnel, shouting loudly: "The cannon is our life, don't let the robbers run wild! Comrades! Hit them hard!" Under his encouragement, the warriors' morale rose even higher, and as a result, they shot down two enemy twin-engine fighters, five Mustang aircraft, and one F-80 fighter, without suffering any casualties themselves.

The warriors of each detachment of the unit, upon hearing this glorious news of victory, further strengthened their technical studies, expressing that they would emulate the Kim Young-soo squadron. Subsequently, they continued to create new victories. The warriors of the Liang Zaijie detachment, who defended a vital section of the transportation line, engaged in heroic combat with enemy aircraft for four consecutive days in November of last year. After running out of artillery shells, they picked up rifles and continued shooting. In this way, they shot down six enemy planes and ensured the smooth flow of the transportation line. During the battle, company commander Cui Shangquan was buried up to his neck in the soil thrown up by a bomb, but after being rescued by his comrades, he continued to direct the battle. Kim Jae-hyuk, the sight setter of the Bae Jong-yoon squadron, was seriously wounded, but resolutely refused to leave the line of fire. On January 10th of this year, the detachment fought fiercely with more than thirty enemy planes and shot down ten of them.

The warriors also shot down enemy planes at night. Noted sharpshooter and "Hero of the Republic" Li Xuexiang shot down six enemy planes in one month, creating a brilliant record of shooting down a total of eleven enemy planes, one of which was an enemy night bomber. Hero Li Zhongzhu shot down four enemy planes in ten days, and later shot down two more enemy planes.

When the unit was stationed in a certain coastal area, the warriors shot down twelve enemy planes in the first week alone. On February 28th, the Choi In-mo squadron shot down four enemy planes on that one day and then engaged in a fierce battle with twelve attacking P-51 and F-80 enemy fighters, shooting down another four enemy planes in one hour.

The unit also officially established a women's anti-aircraft machine gun squad in the coastal area. The female soldiers also demonstrated great courage and composure in combat. On February 20th, the Park Gui-soon women's anti-aircraft machine gun squad intercepted eight enemy planes attempting to bomb a certain railway, shooting down one of them.

During the battles, the warriors also launched a conservation movement, unanimously putting forward the slogan "Save artillery shells for the motherland, increase the hit rate!" Kim Chang-bo, a gunner in the Kim Chang-shan squadron, shot down two enemy planes with eight shells in February. While further improving their technology, the warriors expressed with full confidence that they would use even greater victories to thank the peace-loving people of the world for their concern and support for the Korean people's anti-aggression struggle.

    朝鲜人民军某高射炮部队战果辉煌
    七个月内击落侵朝美机九十六架
    勇士们决进一步提高技术争取更大胜利
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜人民军某高射炮部队，在到二月底为止的七个月中击落敌机九十六架，涌现了八百三十九名因战功卓著而荣获各种勋章和奖章的勇士，并且有李学相、李钟洙、朴春基三人获得了“共和国英雄”的光荣称号。
    这支高射炮部队也和朝鲜人民军的其他部队一样，在抵抗美国侵略者的伟大战争中日益壮大，并且锻炼成为一支英雄的部队。在朝鲜劳动党党员和民主青年同盟盟员带头下，战士们经常总结战斗经验和进行政治学习。他们在革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神的推动下，在战斗中刻苦学习，作战技术一天一天提高，战果也愈来愈大。今年二月五日，该部荣获了“近卫部队”的光荣称号。在这以后的将近一个月中，勇士们就创造了击落敌机三十九架的空前纪录。
    去年七月三十日上午，该部金永洙中队阵地的上空连续有一百多架敌机来袭。疯狂的敌机向阵地附近的村庄里投下了大批炸弹和烧夷弹，爆炸声接连不绝，烟火笼罩了这一地带。但金永洙中队的勇士们仍然沉着地用猛烈的炮火射击敌机。小组长赵权源在尘烟弥漫、弹片乱飞的阵地上，不懈地进行着对空战斗，并且大声喊道：“炮就是我们的生命，别让强盗们逞凶。同志们！猛打啊！”在他的鼓动下，勇士们的斗志更加高涨，结果击落了敌双引擎战斗机两架、野马式机五架和F—八○型战斗机一架，自己无一伤亡。
    该部各区分队的勇士们听到了这个辉煌的胜利消息，都进一步加强了技术学习，表示要向金永洙中队看齐，接着，他们不断地创造了新的胜利。防卫运输线上某要地的梁再杰区分队的勇士们，在去年十一月间连续四天与敌机进行英勇的搏斗。炮弹打完以后，他们拿起步枪继续射击，就这样，他们击落了六架敌机，保障了运输线的畅通。在战斗中，中队长崔尚权全身被埋在炸弹掀起的土里，经战友们抢救出来以后，继续指挥作战。斐钟润中队的标尺手金在赫负了重伤，还是坚决不下火线。今年一月十日，该区分队和三十多架敌机激战，击落了敌机十架。
    勇士们在夜间也击落了敌机。某区分队名射手“共和国英雄”李学相，在一个月中就击落敌机六架，创造了前后共击落敌机十一架的光辉纪录，其中有一架是敌人的夜航轰炸机。英雄李钟洙在十天中就击落了敌机四架，以后又击落敌机两架。
    在该部驻防某海岸地区时，勇士们在头一个星期中就击落了敌机十二架。崔麟模中队在二月二十八日那一天就击落了敌机四架，以后又和来袭的P—五一型与F—八○型敌机战斗机十二架展开激战，在一小时中又击落敌机四架。
    该部并在海岸地区正式成立了女子高射机枪分队。女战士们在战斗中也表现得非常英勇沉着。二月二十日，朴贵顺女高射机枪分队截击企图轰炸某地铁道的敌机八架，击落了其中的一架。
    勇士们在战斗中并展开了节约运动，一致提出了“为祖国节省炮弹，提高命中率！”的口号。金昌
    善中队炮手金昌甫，在二月间以八发炮弹击落了两架敌机。勇士们在进一步提高技术的同时，都信心百倍地表示要以更大的胜利，来答谢全世界爱好和平的人民对于朝鲜人民反侵略斗争的关心和支持。
