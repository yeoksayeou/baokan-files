    Why are new regulations being made for this year's cotton field public grain burden?
    To the Editor: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions Regarding the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio and the Public Grain Burden of Cotton Fields in 1952" on March 12th. Among them, new regulations were made for the public grain burden of cotton fields in 1952. That is: "In areas where the average proportion of the public grain burden of cotton fields in the past accounted for more than 11 percent of the yield of cotton fields (for example, if each mu of cotton field should produce 30 jin of ginned cotton, the burden is 3.3 jin), the burden method will remain unchanged; in areas where the average proportion of the public grain burden of cotton fields in the past was less than 11 percent of the yield of cotton fields, the average proportion of the local cotton field's public grain burden should be increased to 11 percent." Why should the areas where the past cotton field's public grain burden was less than 11 percent of the yield be increased to 11 percent? I hope you can answer this.

    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has made new regulations on the public grain burden of cotton fields this year in order to adjust the public grain burden between cotton fields and grain fields, and between cotton fields, to make it more fair and reasonable.
    Before 1951, the Central People's Government stipulated that all land planted with cotton throughout the country should be taxed according to the income from grain cultivation, in order to reduce the burden on cotton farmers; at that time, this was of positive significance for encouraging farmers to plant more cotton, ensuring the realization of the state's cotton production increase plan, and the supply of raw cotton for the textile industry's production. However, on the other hand, with the rapid expansion of cotton field area, it has resulted in an unreasonable phenomenon in many areas where the public grain burden between cotton fields and grain fields is vastly different. According to surveys in several cotton-producing areas in Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi: For the same mu of land, planting grain can yield 100 jin of rice, while planting cotton can yield 20 to 30 jin of ginned cotton, which is equivalent to nearly 200 to 300 jin of rice, equivalent to two to three times the income from planting grain. Taxing according to the per-mu yield of grain land, the actual tax rate of cotton fields is much lower than that of grain fields. For example, last year the public grain burden ratio for grain fields in North China averaged about 16 percent of the yield; calculated according to this ratio, the burden on cotton fields only accounted for 5 to 8 percent of the income from cotton fields. According to surveys in some areas of Jiangnan, the cotton yield and cotton quality per mu are not as good as those produced in North China and other regions such as Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Hubei, because the soil in these areas is not very suitable for planting cotton. Therefore, the income from planting cotton and the income from planting grain are almost the same, and the cotton field tax rate is similar to the grain field tax rate. This has created an imbalance and unreasonable phenomenon in the burden between cotton fields and grain fields, and between cotton fields; if this phenomenon is not changed in time and allowed to continue to develop, it will objectively promote the blind expansion of cotton fields in some areas, which is unfavorable to the realization of the national agricultural production plan.
        The basic requirement of our country's agricultural production in 1952 is to concentrate efforts on increasing the yield per unit area; especially for grain, the production must be greatly increased, and the planting area must not be reduced. Therefore, the planting area of industrial raw materials and export crops must be stabilized at the 1951 level and cannot be increased any further. Adjusting the public grain burden of cotton fields can play a role in maintaining the cotton field area from expanding further and promoting the increase of the cotton field yield per unit area.
    Although the cotton field burden in some areas will be slightly increased compared to the past according to the new regulations on the public grain burden of cotton fields this year, it is actually still lower when compared with the burden of grain fields. That is to say, planting cotton is still profitable. Cadres of people's governments at all levels and agricultural and tax authorities should explain the truth and the policy to the broad masses of cotton farmers to ensure the smooth implementation of this year's cotton field burden policy.　Editor

### 为什么要对今年棉田的公粮负担作出新的规定？

    为什么要对今年棉田的公粮负担作出新的规定？
    编辑同志：中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会在三月十二日发布了“关于一九五二年棉粮比价及棉田的公粮负担的指示”。其中对一九五二年棉田的公粮负担，作出了新的规定。即：“凡过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例在百分之十一（例如每亩棉田应产皮棉三十斤，负担三点三斤）以上的地区，其负担办法照旧不变；过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例不及百分之十一的地区，应把当地棉田的公粮负担的平均比例提高到百分之十一。”为什么要把过去棉田的公粮负担不足应产量百分之十一的地区提高到百分之十一呢？希望予以解答。

    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会对今年棉田的公粮负担作出了新的规定，这是为了要调整棉田和粮田之间、棉田和棉田之间的公粮负担，使它趋于公平合理。
    一九五一年以前，中央人民政府规定全国种植棉花的土地都按种粮收入征收农业税，以减轻棉农的负担；这在当时对奖励农民多种棉花，保证国家增产棉花计划的实现和纺织工业生产的原棉供应，是有积极的意义的。但另一方面，随着棉田面积的迅速扩大，就使得很多地区产生棉田和粮田公粮负担悬殊的不合理现象。据河北、河南、陕西若干产棉区的调查：同样一亩土地，种粮收入一百斤米，种棉可以收皮棉二十到三十斤，折米将近二百到三百斤，相当于种粮收入的两倍到三倍。按照种粮地亩产量收税，棉田的实际税率要比粮田低得很多。例如去年华北粮田的公粮负担比例，平均占应产量的百分之十六左右，按照这样的比例计算，棉田负担却只占棉田收入的百分之五到百分之八。另据江南若干地区的调查，由于这些地区的土壤不太适宜于种植棉花，每亩地的棉花产量及棉花品质都不如华北各地和陕西、河南、山东、湖北等地区所产的棉花，因此种棉收入和种粮收入相差无几，棉田税率与粮田税率相近。这就形成棉田与粮田、棉田与棉田之间负担的不平衡和不合理的现象；如果不及时加以改变而让这种现象继续发展，客观上将会促使某些地区棉田盲目扩大，对实现国家农业生产计划是不利的。
        一九五二年我们国家农业生产的基本要求，是集中力量增加单位面积的产量；特别是粮食，必须大量增产，播种面积决不能减少。因此，工业原料和外销作物的播种面积必须稳定在一九五一年的水平，不能再增加。对棉田公粮负担的调整，是能起保持棉田面积不再扩大，并促进提高棉田单位面积产量的作用的。
    今年按照棉田公粮负担的新规定，虽然部分地区的棉田负担比过去有些增加，但它和粮田的负担比较起来，实际上还是要低一些的。也就是说，种植棉花还是有利的。各级人民政府和农业、税务机关的干部，应向广大棉农说明道理，讲明政策，保证今年的棉田负担政策顺利贯彻执行。　编者
