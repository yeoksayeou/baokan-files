China has historically had long-standing trade relations with European countries. China has close commercial ties with Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and West Germany, especially with Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and West Germany. China used to purchase large quantities of machinery, hardware, industrial equipment, transportation equipment, and daily necessities from them; and supplied them with large quantities of agricultural products, animal products, and industrial raw materials. China was, is, and will likely continue to be an important market for their industrial equipment and industrial products, but due to artificial obstacles, this traditional trade relationship has been greatly reduced.

China's trade relations with Britain have a history of more than 270 years. The highest period of Sino-British import and export volume reached over 200 million US dollars annually. But now, Sino-British trade has decreased by more than 90 percent in quantity.

China began trade with France in 1660, and the highest historical import and export volume was nearly 100 million customs taels per year; but it has now decreased by 95 percent.

China's trade with Belgium began as early as 1830. Sino-Belgian trade also had a significant recovery after the war. But since 1951, it has decreased significantly again.

China and Germany began to develop trade relations in the 16th century. Before the war, the trade volume reached 64 million US dollars annually. After the war, China's trade with West Germany also had some recovery, but now trade between the two sides has been completely cut off.

China and Asian countries have always had long-standing and close economic relations due to their geographical proximity. In particular, the trade between China and Japan, before the war, had a total import and export value of more than 340 million yuan per year. There was a certain degree of recovery in 1950, but now it is in a state of almost complete stagnation. Japan, which has always relied on China for cheap and high-quality ore, coking coal, industrial salt, and soybeans, can no longer obtain them.

China has always had very close trade relations with Southeast Asian countries. China used to export soybeans, silk, and various daily necessities to them; and import rubber, coconut oil, cotton, burlap bags, and other supplies. Although the recovery of trade after the war was rapid, it has now encountered many difficulties.

China also had nearly 100 years of trade relations with countries in the Americas, especially the United States. But this relationship was severed by the US government on December 17, 1950.

Obviously, the artificial obstacles that cause the shrinkage of international trade relations are detrimental to the people of all countries, the industrialists and businessmen of all countries, and the economic development of all countries. Therefore, we advocate expanding international trade as much as possible on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and we do not approve of using blockade embargoes or discriminatory policies to cause international trade to shrink.

As everyone knows, China is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. In the past two years, New China has made great achievements in restoring and developing the national economy. China's industrial and agricultural production is now close to pre-war levels, and some have exceeded pre-war levels, and there will be greater development in 1952. The possibility of China developing trade with other countries is unlimited.

I would like to talk here about the possibilities of China's exports.

China's soybeans occupy a very important position in the world market. Its quality is excellent, and the production quantity can be increased in a planned way. The export quantity is very large. I believe that Chinese soybeans can meet the needs of Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, and Northern European countries.

China is the world's largest and earliest producer and exporter of tung oil. I believe that the quantity of tung oil we can export can fully meet the needs of the countries present here.

Various vegetable oils and their seeds produced in China, such as peanuts, sesame seeds, soybean oil, soybean cake, and peanut oil, occupy an important position in the world market. As far as I know, many European countries need vegetable oils and their seeds. I believe that China can fully supply you.

China has a large amount of pork available for export. The high-quality eggs produced in China, both in the past and now, can be supplied to the people of Europe in large quantities. As far as I know, the people of some countries do not have sufficient supplies of meat and eggs, and some governments have reduced the ration of meat and eggs to an unbelievable level. If these countries make requests to China for meat and eggs, we believe that China can satisfy them in terms of quantity and quality.

In the past two years, the quality of Chinese tea and silk has been greatly improved, and it is developing towards the highest production level in history. Now the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries are China's largest customers for tea and silk. Chinese tea, especially green tea, has gained a very good reputation among the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the past two years. If the people of other countries also need Chinese tea and silk, we are willing to supply you in the same way as we do to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries.

The output of Chinese tobacco leaves in 1951 exceeded one-third of the highest output in history. Now China has begun to have a large amount of tobacco leaves available for export.

China can meet the requirements of all countries in the world for pig bristles, I think there is no need to elaborate.

China has a large amount of coking coal and fuel coal that can be supplied to Japan and other countries. The price of Chinese coal shipped to Japan is about 20 US dollars per ton cheaper than the price of coal imported by Japan from another hemisphere. If there are no artificial obstacles, I believe that using Chinese coal will help reduce Japan's industrial costs and improve the living conditions of the Japanese people.

I believe that China's antimony, salt, alum, manganese ore, magnesite, and other mineral products are export materials well-known to all countries, especially Japan.

I believe that the handicrafts created by the Chinese people due to their long history of culture, such as embroidery, brocade, carvings, cloisonn√©, drawnwork lace, lacquerware, and carpets, have enjoyed a very high reputation among the people of the world, and the Chinese people are willing to continue to supply these works of art to the world.

This is the possibility of China's exports. Because China's economic construction is being carried out on a large scale, this possibility is constantly growing. This provides a strong guarantee for all countries in the world to purchase these materials from China for a long time and to continuously expand international trade with China.

China's imports, like its exports, also have extremely great potential. Due to land reform and economic construction, the living standards of the people have improved. Therefore, there has emerged a huge purchasing power of nearly 500 million people. In 1951, China's people's purchasing power increased by 22 percent compared with 1950, and it increased greatly in 1952 compared with 1951. This huge purchasing power, unprecedented in Chinese history, has expanded the domestic market, stimulated production development, and at the same time provided a strong guarantee for the expansion of export trade to China from all countries in the world. The Chinese people need to develop their own industry, so we need various industrial equipment, various machines and accessories, various tools, various metal materials and chemical raw materials. In addition to these goods, China is also very interested in daily industrial products and certain industrial raw materials. We believe that industrial manufacturers and exporters who are willing to sell us gum, rubber products, sugar, cotton, chemical fertilizers, petroleum, paper, pulp, and many other daily necessities for the people will find a vast market in China. It is not difficult for you to imagine that if nearly 500 million Chinese people eat one kilogram of sugar more per year, it will increase the demand for 500,000 tons of sugar. If three people wear one more pair of rubber shoes, and one thousand farmers buy one more rubber-wheeled carriage, it will require more than 40,000 tons of rubber per year. China's cultural life is improving. New factories, schools, hospitals, and residences are being built everywhere. It is not difficult for you to imagine the sales of medicines, medical equipment, building materials, and paper in China.

This is the possibility of China's imports. This possibility will be infinitely expanded with the continued development of China's economic construction and the continued improvement of the people's living standards in the future. I can now tell you that if the conditions are suitable and we can exchange for the materials we need for production and life, in addition to trading with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, after overcoming artificial obstacles, based on the current incomplete materials, it is estimated that we can develop import and export trade with private enterprise economies to 1.5 to 1.9 billion rubles in two or three years, that is, 600 to 900 million rubles per year, which is two to three times the highest year during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek after the war, namely 1946.

From this, it can be seen that it is beneficial to all countries and peoples in the world, regardless of their beliefs, political systems, and socio-economic systems, as long as they develop international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have benefited from developing and developing such international trade. I firmly believe that through the joint efforts of the people of all countries in the world, the various artificial obstacles in international trade can be overcome, and normal international trade can be developed. Based on this belief, I am willing to conduct trade negotiations with any representative attending the conference, and I am willing to discuss and sign various agreements and conduct specific transactions according to mutual needs and possibilities, or establish mutual entrustment agency relationships. For those who are not able to conduct transactions immediately but are willing to do so in the future, we can also establish certain mutual contacts for continued negotiations after the meeting.
