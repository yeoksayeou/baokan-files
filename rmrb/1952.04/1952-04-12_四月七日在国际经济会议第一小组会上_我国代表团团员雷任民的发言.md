China has historically had long-standing trade relations with European countries. China has close commercial ties with Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and West Germany, especially with Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and West Germany. China used to purchase large quantities of machinery, hardware, industrial equipment, transportation equipment, and daily necessities from them; and supplied them with large quantities of agricultural products, animal products, and industrial raw materials. China was, is, and will likely continue to be an important market for their industrial equipment and industrial products, but due to artificial obstacles, this traditional trade relationship has been greatly reduced.

China's trade relations with Britain have a history of more than 270 years. The highest period of Sino-British import and export volume reached over 200 million US dollars annually. But now, Sino-British trade has decreased by more than 90 percent in quantity.

China began trade with France in 1660, and the highest historical import and export volume was nearly 100 million customs taels per year; but it has now decreased by 95 percent.

China's trade with Belgium began as early as 1830. Sino-Belgian trade also had a significant recovery after the war. But since 1951, it has decreased significantly again.

China and Germany began to develop trade relations in the 16th century. Before the war, the trade volume reached 64 million US dollars annually. After the war, China's trade with West Germany also had some recovery, but now trade between the two sides has been completely cut off.

China and Asian countries have always had long-standing and close economic relations due to their geographical proximity. In particular, the trade between China and Japan, before the war, had a total import and export value of more than 340 million yuan per year. There was a certain degree of recovery in 1950, but now it is in a state of almost complete stagnation. Japan, which has always relied on China for cheap and high-quality ore, coking coal, industrial salt, and soybeans, can no longer obtain them.

China has always had very close trade relations with Southeast Asian countries. China used to export soybeans, silk, and various daily necessities to them; and import rubber, coconut oil, cotton, burlap bags, and other supplies. Although the recovery of trade after the war was rapid, it has now encountered many difficulties.

China also had nearly 100 years of trade relations with countries in the Americas, especially the United States. But this relationship was severed by the US government on December 17, 1950.

Obviously, the artificial obstacles that cause the shrinkage of international trade relations are detrimental to the people of all countries, the industrialists and businessmen of all countries, and the economic development of all countries. Therefore, we advocate expanding international trade as much as possible on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and we do not approve of using blockade embargoes or discriminatory policies to cause international trade to shrink.

As everyone knows, China is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. In the past two years, New China has made great achievements in restoring and developing the national economy. China's industrial and agricultural production is now close to pre-war levels, and some have exceeded pre-war levels, and there will be greater development in 1952. The possibility of China developing trade with other countries is unlimited.

I would like to talk here about the possibilities of China's exports.

China's soybeans occupy a very important position in the world market. Its quality is excellent, and the production quantity can be increased in a planned way. The export quantity is very large. I believe that Chinese soybeans can meet the needs of Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, and Northern European countries.

China is the world's largest and earliest producer and exporter of tung oil. I believe that the quantity of tung oil we can export can fully meet the needs of the countries present here.

Various vegetable oils and their seeds produced in China, such as peanuts, sesame seeds, soybean oil, soybean cake, and peanut oil, occupy an important position in the world market. As far as I know, many European countries need vegetable oils and their seeds. I believe that China can fully supply you.

China has a large amount of pork available for export. The high-quality eggs produced in China, both in the past and now, can be supplied to the people of Europe in large quantities. As far as I know, the people of some countries do not have sufficient supplies of meat and eggs, and some governments have reduced the ration of meat and eggs to an unbelievable level. If these countries make requests to China for meat and eggs, we believe that China can satisfy them in terms of quantity and quality.

In the past two years, the quality of Chinese tea and silk has been greatly improved, and it is developing towards the highest production level in history. Now the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries are China's largest customers for tea and silk. Chinese tea, especially green tea, has gained a very good reputation among the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the past two years. If the people of other countries also need Chinese tea and silk, we are willing to supply you in the same way as we do to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries.

The output of Chinese tobacco leaves in 1951 exceeded one-third of the highest output in history. Now China has begun to have a large amount of tobacco leaves available for export.

China can meet the requirements of all countries in the world for pig bristles, I think there is no need to elaborate.

China has a large amount of coking coal and fuel coal that can be supplied to Japan and other countries. The price of Chinese coal shipped to Japan is about 20 US dollars per ton cheaper than the price of coal imported by Japan from another hemisphere. If there are no artificial obstacles, I believe that using Chinese coal will help reduce Japan's industrial costs and improve the living conditions of the Japanese people.

I believe that China's antimony, salt, alum, manganese ore, magnesite, and other mineral products are export materials well-known to all countries, especially Japan.

I believe that the handicrafts created by the Chinese people due to their long history of culture, such as embroidery, brocade, carvings, cloisonné, drawnwork lace, lacquerware, and carpets, have enjoyed a very high reputation among the people of the world, and the Chinese people are willing to continue to supply these works of art to the world.

This is the possibility of China's exports. Because China's economic construction is being carried out on a large scale, this possibility is constantly growing. This provides a strong guarantee for all countries in the world to purchase these materials from China for a long time and to continuously expand international trade with China.

China's imports, like its exports, also have extremely great potential. Due to land reform and economic construction, the living standards of the people have improved. Therefore, there has emerged a huge purchasing power of nearly 500 million people. In 1951, China's people's purchasing power increased by 22 percent compared with 1950, and it increased greatly in 1952 compared with 1951. This huge purchasing power, unprecedented in Chinese history, has expanded the domestic market, stimulated production development, and at the same time provided a strong guarantee for the expansion of export trade to China from all countries in the world. The Chinese people need to develop their own industry, so we need various industrial equipment, various machines and accessories, various tools, various metal materials and chemical raw materials. In addition to these goods, China is also very interested in daily industrial products and certain industrial raw materials. We believe that industrial manufacturers and exporters who are willing to sell us gum, rubber products, sugar, cotton, chemical fertilizers, petroleum, paper, pulp, and many other daily necessities for the people will find a vast market in China. It is not difficult for you to imagine that if nearly 500 million Chinese people eat one kilogram of sugar more per year, it will increase the demand for 500,000 tons of sugar. If three people wear one more pair of rubber shoes, and one thousand farmers buy one more rubber-wheeled carriage, it will require more than 40,000 tons of rubber per year. China's cultural life is improving. New factories, schools, hospitals, and residences are being built everywhere. It is not difficult for you to imagine the sales of medicines, medical equipment, building materials, and paper in China.

This is the possibility of China's imports. This possibility will be infinitely expanded with the continued development of China's economic construction and the continued improvement of the people's living standards in the future. I can now tell you that if the conditions are suitable and we can exchange for the materials we need for production and life, in addition to trading with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, after overcoming artificial obstacles, based on the current incomplete materials, it is estimated that we can develop import and export trade with private enterprise economies to 1.5 to 1.9 billion rubles in two or three years, that is, 600 to 900 million rubles per year, which is two to three times the highest year during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek after the war, namely 1946.

From this, it can be seen that it is beneficial to all countries and peoples in the world, regardless of their beliefs, political systems, and socio-economic systems, as long as they develop international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have benefited from developing and developing such international trade. I firmly believe that through the joint efforts of the people of all countries in the world, the various artificial obstacles in international trade can be overcome, and normal international trade can be developed. Based on this belief, I am willing to conduct trade negotiations with any representative attending the conference, and I am willing to discuss and sign various agreements and conduct specific transactions according to mutual needs and possibilities, or establish mutual entrustment agency relationships. For those who are not able to conduct transactions immediately but are willing to do so in the future, we can also establish certain mutual contacts for continued negotiations after the meeting.

    四月七日在国际经济会议第一小组会上
    我国代表团团员雷任民的发言
    中国与欧洲各国在历史上有着长久的贸易关系。中国与英国、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、瑞士和西德，其中特别是与英、法、比、意和西德更有着密切的商业关系。中国曾经向他们购买过大批的机器五金工业器材交通设备和人民生活日用品；曾经供给过他们大批的农产品畜产品和工业原料。中国曾经是，现在和将来也可能是他们的工业设备和工业品的重要市场，但现在由于人为的障碍，这种传统的贸易关系大大被缩小了。
    中国与英国的贸易关系已有二百七十余年的历史。中英输出入额最高时期曾年达两亿余美元。但到现在，中英贸易在数量上已减少了百分之九十以上。
    中国与法国在一六六零年即已开始通商，历史上输出入额最高时期曾年近一亿海关两；但到现在已减少了百分之九十五。
    中国与比利时的贸易早在一八三零年即已开始了。战后中比贸易也曾经有过很大的恢复。但自一九五一年起又大大减少了。
    中国与德国十六世纪以来即已开始发生贸易关系。战前贸易额曾年达六四零零万美元。战后中国与西德的贸易也有着若干的恢复，但现在双方贸易往来已完全断绝了。
    中国与亚洲各国，由于地理上接壤，历史上一向存在着悠久的密切的经济关系。特别是中日两国的贸易，战前输出入总值曾年达三四零零零余万元。一九五零年曾有一定程度的恢复，但现在已处于几乎完全停顿的状态。日本历来依靠中国供给的价格便宜品质优良的矿砂焦煤工业用盐和大豆，现在也得不到了。
    中国与东南亚各国在贸易关系上一直是非常密切的。中国曾经向他们输出大豆、丝及各种人民生活用品；输入橡胶椰油棉花麻袋及其他用品。战后贸易的恢复虽然很快，但到现在也遭到了许多困难。
    中国与美洲各国特别是与美国也有近一百年的贸易关系。但这种关系已为美国政府于一九五零年十二月十七日割断了。
    显然，使国际间贸易关系陷于萎缩的人为的障碍，对各国人民，各国的工商业家，各国的经济发展都是不利的。所以我们主张在平等互利的基础上尽量扩大国际贸易，而不赞成用封锁禁运或歧视政策，使国际贸易陷于萎缩。
    大家知道，中国是一个地大物博人口众多的国家。两年来，新中国在恢复和发展国民经济方面，已获得很大的成就。中国的工业农业生产，现在已接近于战前水平，有的已超过战前水平，一九五二年将有更大的发展。中国同其他国家发展贸易的可能性是无限的。
    我愿意在这里谈谈中国输出的可能性。
    中国的大豆，在世界市场上占有很重要的地位。他的品质是优良的，生产数量还可有计划的增加。在输出数量上是很大的。我相信中国大豆可以满足英国、法国、西德、日本及北欧等国家的需要。
    中国是世界上最大的与最早的桐油生产国家与输出国家。我认为我们可能输出的桐油数量，完全可以满足在座的各国的需要。
    中国各种植物油脂及其子实，如花生、芝麻、豆油、豆饼、花生油等，在世界市场上均占有重要地位。据我所知，欧洲许多国家都需要植物油脂及其子实。我相信中国能够充分地供给你们。
    中国有大量的猪肉可供出口。中国所产的品质优良的鸡蛋，不论过去和现在，都可以大量供给欧洲人民的需要。据我所知，有一些国家的人民对肉类和鸡蛋得不到充分的供应，有的政府已将肉类和鸡蛋的配给额减少到不能令人置信的程度。如果这些国家向中国提出肉类和鸡蛋的要求，我们相信中国在数量上质量上，都可以使他们满意。
    两年来中国的茶叶和丝绸在质量上已有很大的改进，并正在向历史上最高产量水平发展。现在苏联和其他人民民主国家，是中国的茶叶和丝绸的最大主顾。中国的茶，特别是绿茶，近两年来在苏联和东欧人民中获得了很好的声誉。如果其他国家的人民也需要中国茶叶和丝绸，我们愿意和对苏联及其他人民民主国家一样地供给你们。
    中国烟叶在一九五一年的产量，超过历史上的最高产量的三分之一。现在中国已开始有大量的烟叶可供出口。
    中国可以满足全世界各国对猪鬃的要求，我想用不着多加说明。
    中国有大量的炼焦煤和燃料煤，可以供给日本和其他国家。中国煤运往日本的价格，比日本从另一个半球输入的煤的价格每吨要便宜二十美元上下。如果没有人为的障碍，我相信使用中国煤将有助于降低日本的工业成本及改善日本人民的生活条件。
    我相信中国的锑、盐、铁矾土、锰砂镁砂及其他矿产品，都是世界各国特别是日本所熟悉的出口物资。
    我相信中国人民由于悠久的文化而创造的手工艺品，如刺绣、织锦、雕刻、景泰蓝、抽丝花边、漆器、地毯，在全世界人民中已享有很高的声誉，中国人民愿意把这些艺术作品继续供给全世界。
    这就是中国输出的可能性。由于中国的经济建设正在大规模地进行，因此这种可能性正在不断地增长。这就给全世界一切国家提供了长期向中国购买这些物资，与中国不断扩大国际贸易的有力的保证。
    中国的进口和出口一样，也有极大的潜在力量。由于土地改革和经济建设，人民生活水平提高了。因此出现了一个近五万万人口的庞大的购买力。一九五一年中国的人民购买力比一九五零年增加了百分之二十二，一九五二年又比一九五一年大为增加。这种中国历史上从未有过的庞大购买力，扩大了国内市场，刺激了生产发展，同时又为世界各国对中国的出口贸易的扩大提供了有力的保证。中国人民需要发展自己的工业，因此我们需要各种工业设备、各种机器和配件、各种工具、各种金属材料与化学原料，除了这些货物以外，中国对于日用工业品和某些工业原料也有很大的兴趣。我们相信，愿意卖给我们树胶胶制品、糖、棉花、化学肥料、石油、纸张、纸浆和许多其他人民生活日用品的工业制造商和出口商，将会在中国找到广大的市场。你们不难想像，近五万万中国人民，如果每人每年多吃一公斤糖就会增加五十万吨糖的需要量。如果三个人多穿一双胶鞋，一千个农民多买一辆胶皮轮马车，就每年需要多用橡胶四万余吨。中国的文化生活正在提高。到处正在建筑新的工厂学校医院住宅，你们不难想像到药品医疗器械建筑材料和纸张在中国的销路。
    这就是中国输入的可能性。这种可能性随着今后中国经济建设的继续发展与人民生活水平的继续提高，还将无限地扩大。我现在可以告诉你们，如果条件适合，能换回我们生产和生活上需要的物资，中国除与苏联及各人民民主国家进行贸易外，在人为障碍克服以后，拿现在不完整的材料，估计可以在两三年内与私人企业经济国家发展进出口贸易到一百五十至一百九十万万卢布，也就是每年六十至九十万万卢布，为战后蒋介石反动统治时期最高的一年即一九四六年的二倍至三倍。
    由此可见，世界各国和人民，不管其信仰，政治制度及社会经济制度如何不同，只要在平等互利的基础上发展国际贸易，对大家都是有好处的。中国同苏联及各人民民主国家间，正是由于发展了与发展着这样的国际贸易，而大家得到了好处。我深信，经过世界各国人民共同努力，国际贸易方面的各种人为的障碍是可以克服的，正常的国际贸易是可以发展的。基于这种信念，我愿意与出席大会任何一个代表进行有关贸易的商谈，并愿意根据彼此的需要与可能，商讨和签订各种协议，进行具体交易，或建立相互委托代理关系，对于目前还不能够立即进行交易而愿意将来再进行的，也可以建立一定的相互联系，以便会后的继续商谈。
