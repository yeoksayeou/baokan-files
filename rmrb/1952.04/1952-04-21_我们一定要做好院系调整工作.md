    We Must Do a Good Job in Adjusting University Departments and Faculties
    Chu Sheng-lin, Vice Provost of Yenching University
    Our country is advancing towards industrialization, and all sectors need a large number of construction cadres. Therefore, the training of industrial talents is urgently needed. However, during the past reactionary rule, Chinese universities lacked a unified development plan, resulting in duplication of departments and faculties, dispersion of human and material resources, and the adverse effects of old ideologies and work styles, creating chaos and waste. If these phenomena are not thoroughly reformed, the existing universities will not be sufficient to meet the needs of New China's construction. Therefore, the adjustment of university departments and faculties nationwide is undoubtedly necessary. Now that the training of industrial talents is very urgent, it is essential for the People's Government to focus on engineering colleges in this year's adjustment of university departments and faculties.
    This adjustment of departments and faculties includes a comprehensive adjustment of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University in Beijing: the departments of the engineering colleges of Peking University and the engineering-related departments of Yenching University will be merged into Tsinghua University. Tsinghua University will be transformed into a multi-disciplinary industrial university, with its name unchanged. The faculties of arts, sciences, and law of Tsinghua University and the departments of arts, sciences, and law of Yenching University will be merged into Peking University. Peking University will become a comprehensive university. The name of Yenching University will be abolished. I know that all colleagues at Yenching University are willing to contribute their share of strength under the leadership of the People's Government to do more for the motherland. They enthusiastically support this adjustment plan.
    When the adjustment plan was first discussed, everyone at Yenching University expressed their support, but were there absolutely no concerns in their minds? Some might have had them. At that time, some may have thought: the work we are currently doing has achieved considerable results. After the adjustment, will we still be able to continue this work in the new organization? The current development plan is what we want to carry out and is suitable for our capabilities. Will it still be possible to realize it after the adjustment? Perhaps some people may also think: what will the personnel relationships be like in the new environment, and will there be opportunities to fully utilize their abilities? However, these ideas based on personal interests have been criticized in the "Three-Anti" movement. Everyone has realized that the interests of the part should be subordinate to the interests of the whole, and the interests of the country are the greatest and long-term interests of the individual. Everyone has established the idea of serving the people and the motherland. Some ideological concerns that may have existed in the past will gradually be eliminated.
    Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University are all in the capital, so close to each other, and most of the departments are duplicated. Some departments have not been able to achieve the high efficiency required by the state due to limited human and material resources. For example, Yenching University's three engineering departments—Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering—are all available in the engineering colleges of Peking University and Tsinghua University. Although the work of these three departments at Yenching University has achieved certain results, such as the achievements of the Chemical Engineering Department in the actual manufacturing research of pigskin leather making, insulating magnetic materials, refractory materials, and chemical experimental porcelain; the Mechanical Engineering Department also has considerable achievements in machine tool manufacturing; and the Civil Engineering Department is planning to develop towards highway engineering. However, due to the insufficient number of teachers and limited housing in the school, these three departments have not been able to recruit more students in recent years, and some work is duplicated with other schools. After the adjustment, the personnel and equipment of the engineering departments of the three universities are concentrated in Tsinghua University. Under unified management, the organization and personnel are redeployed. Not only can the number of students be greatly increased to meet the urgent needs of the country, but the teaching efficiency will also be improved. This multi-disciplinary industrial university will train a large number of construction talents for the motherland. Furthermore, the departments of arts, sciences, and law of the three universities are all merged into Peking University. With more concentrated teachers and richer books and instruments, it will become a large-scale comprehensive university in the capital. Its contribution to our country's academic field is foreseeable. Now that the teachers have undergone a certain degree of ideological remolding, in the newly formed two universities, they will definitely make a revolutionary reform of the curriculum, eliminate the bourgeois teaching ideology, theories, and teaching systems, and establish new courses and research plans based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to serve the cultural construction and industrial construction of our motherland.
    The adjustment work of the three universities is now underway. Many specific issues are being gradually resolved. After the general improvement of everyone's thinking, they will definitely give full play to their patriotic enthusiasm and work together to do this important work well. I think that the relevant schools in various places included in the adjustment plan are also actively carrying out their reorganization work. Let all of us in the education sector look forward to the bright future of the motherland's construction and work together with joy and enthusiasm for the people's education!

    我们一定要做好院系调整工作
    燕京大学副教务长  褚圣麟
    我国正在向着工业化的方向迈进，各方面都需要大量的建设干部，因此工业人材的培养是急不可待了。但是我国高等学校在已往反动统治时期是没有统一发展计划的，因此院系重复，人力物力分散，加以旧思想和旧作风的恶劣影响，造成凌乱和浪费的现象；这些现象若不加以彻底的改革，原有的高等学校决不足以适应新中国建设的需要。所以全国大学的院系需要调整，是无可置疑的。现在工业人材的培养很迫切，人民政府今年调整各大学院系以工学院为重点，这是十分必要的。
    这次院系的调整，包括在北京的北京、清华、燕京三大学的全面调整：就是将北京大学工学院、燕京大学工科方面各系并入清华大学。清华大学改为多科性的工业高等学校，校名不变。将清华大学的文、理、法三学院及燕京大学的文、理、法方面的各系并入北京大学。北京大学成为综合性的大学。燕京大学校名撤销。我知道我们燕京大学的同人都愿在人民政府的领导下，贡献自己的一分力量，为祖国多做一点事；对于这个调整方案，是以兴奋热烈的心情来拥护的。
    在开始谈到调整计划的时候，燕京大学同人都已表示拥护，但思想上是否完全没有顾虑呢？可能有人会有的。那时也许有人会想，现在正在进行的工作已获得相当成绩，调整后在新机构中是否还能继续做这些工作；现在的发展计划是自己愿意进行的、是适合自己的能力的，调整后是否仍能实现。也许还有人会想到：在新环境中人事关系又怎样，有否充分发挥自己能力的机会。但这些从个人利益出发的想法在“三反”运动中都已受到批判。大家都认识到，部分的利益应当服从全体的利益，国家的利益才是个人的最大利益和长远的利益；大家都树立了为人民为祖国服务的思想。从前可能存在的一些思想顾虑都是会逐渐消除的。
    北京、清华、燕京三大学同在首都，相处那么近，而大多数的学系是重复的。有些学系因为人力物力有限又未能发挥国家需要的高度效率。例如燕京大学的工程三系——化工、机械、土木——在北京大学和清华大学的工学院中都有的。虽然燕京这三系的工作是有一定的成绩的，如化工系在猪皮制革、绝缘磁、耐火材料和化学实验磁器等实际制造研究方面已有成就；机械系在工具机制造方面亦有相当成绩；土木系计划着向公路工程发展。但三系因教员人数不足，校中房舍有限，近年来仍不能多招学生，而且有些工作是和别校重复的。调整后，三校工程各系的人员、设备都集中在清华大学里，在统一的管理下，把机构和人事重新部署，不但学生名额可以大量增加，以应国家的急需，而且教学效率也一定可以提高。这个多科性的工业高等学校将为祖国培养出大量的建设人材。再，三校文、理、法方面各系都归并在北京大学里，教员更集中了，图书、仪器更丰富了，它将成为首都规模宏大的综合性大学；它对我国学术上的贡献是可以预期的。现在教师都已经过一定的思想改造，在新组成的两大学里，一定能把课程作一番革命性的改革，把资产阶级的教学思想、理论和教学制度剔除出去，建立起以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想为基础的新课程和新研究计划，为我们祖国的文化建设和工业建设服务。
    现在三校调整工作已在进行了。许多具体问题正在逐步解决。在大家思想普遍提高后，一定会发挥高度爱国主义的积极性，同心协力来做好这个重要的工作。我想，包括在调整方案中的各地有关学校也都在积极进行他们的改组工作。让我们教育界同人大家都瞻望着祖国建设的光明前途，欢欣鼓舞地一致为人民的教育事业而努力吧。
