The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 137, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Stop the Germ Warfare Criminals!" and devotes considerable space to reporting on the worldwide people's angry protests against the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The editorial points out that the barbarity and cruelty of the American imperialists far exceeds that of the Hitler beasts. Having no hope of stopping the heroic resistance of the glorious Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they resorted to the most despicable means of slaughtering civilians. However, the people of all countries unanimously oppose this long-planned and shameful crime. The united front of the people of all countries can and must end the crimes of the American bandits and make the names of the American instigators and organizers of germ warfare infamous for all time.

Important articles in this issue include: Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Longo's "Struggle for Peace, Work, and the Unity of the Working Class in Italy," Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee Political Bureau member Constantinescu's "Currency Reform and Price Reductions in the Romanian People's Republic," and Mitin's "The Flourishing of Science and Culture in the Soviet Union."

In his article, Longo points out that in the past year, the Italian government has continued to take dangerous steps towards war. Not only does it not stop the US policy of expanding its arms buildup, but it is even more willing than others to act as a running dog for war merchants. Every Italian can see that the policy of preparing for war and expanding armaments makes the country even poorer and more reactionary. The masses' desire to establish a peace government is increasing day by day. In the face of the growing opposition of the broad masses, the ruling clique responsible for implementing this policy attempts to cover up its actions that endanger the country and intensify its efforts to win people over. However, these methods cannot stop the nationwide peace movement, nor can they stop the realization of concrete measures taken by peace fighters to unite more people to defend peace. In the last few months of 1951, factory workers waged a tenacious and arduous struggle to protect industry. The struggle of the working peasants for land defeated the government's conspiracy to divide the peasants. The struggle launched by the General Confederation of Labor against excessive exploitation has entered a higher stage. To expand this movement and achieve victory, it is necessary to unite all working people who are concerned about this movement. Longo emphasized that the situation in Italy is becoming increasingly serious and complex. In this situation, the activities of the Communist Party, democratic groups, and the broad masses are of decisive significance in defending peace and the labor and freedom of the Italian people.

Constantinescu's article states that the Romanian People's Republic and the Central Committee of the Workers' Party issued an order to implement currency reform and reduce the prices of major consumer goods in the country from January 28 to 31. The purpose of the currency reform is to increase the purchasing power of the leu (Romanian currency), increase the exchange rate of the leu against foreign currencies, increase the real wages of workers and staff, and improve the supply of materials needed by the working people. At the same time, the reduction of prices is a great material benefit for the people, which increases the real wages of workers and staff. Constantinescu then pointed out that the currency reform of 1952 economically strengthened Romania's national power, improved the living standards of the working people, and consolidated the people's democratic system and national sovereignty. Therefore, it was warmly welcomed and approved by all working people. The working class and working peasants once again saw that the Workers' Party and the People's Government are concerned about the continuous improvement of the living standards of all working people; and the working masses are even more enthusiastically implementing the 1952 economic plan.

In his article, Mitin discussed the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to award Stalin Prizes for scientific inventions and literature and art in 1951. Mitin emphasized that the awarding of the Stalin Prizes is another manifestation of the vigorous development and flourishing of Soviet socialist culture. The appearance of a group of brilliant new stars in the Soviet Union—the winners of the Stalin Prizes—once again shows the vast difference between the development of science in the Soviet Union and the situation of science in capitalist society. Soviet science transforms nature, creates sophisticated machines and machinery, reduces human labor as much as possible, and invents effective methods to overcome diseases; while "science" in capitalist society is studying the issue of mass murder of mankind, following the orders of imperialist monopoly capitalists to carefully manufacture the most poisonous weapons of mass destruction of the people, such as chemical weapons and bacteriological weapons. Soviet socialist culture strives to provide the people with knowledge, cultivate their integrity, labor heroism, moral purity, and noble qualities. As for the decadent "culture" of imperialism, it destroys people, poisons their minds, cultivates ideas of hatred of humanity among the people, promotes moral degradation, caters to the lowest instincts, and encourages crime. It is precisely for this reason that the progressive people of all countries reject this life-corroding capitalist "culture" with disgust and hatred, and welcome the news of the greater prosperity of the Soviet Union in science and culture with admiration.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三七期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三七期已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“制止细菌战犯！”的社论，并以大量篇幅报道了全世界人民愤怒抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的滔天罪行。社论指出：美帝国主义者的野蛮和残酷远超过希特勒野兽，他们已经没有任何希望能够阻止光荣的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗，因此就使用了最卑鄙的屠杀平民的手段。但是，各国人民一致反对这种蓄谋已久的可耻罪行。各国人民的统一战线能够而且必须终止美国强盗们的罪行，使进行细菌战的美国煽动者和组织者的名字遗臭万年。
    本期的重要文章有：意大利共产党副总书记朗哥的“为意大利的和平、工作与工人阶级的团结而奋斗”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员康斯坦丁尼斯库的“罗马尼亚人民共和国的币制改革和减低物价”，米丁的“百花争放的苏联的科学和文化”等。
    朗哥在文章中指出：在过去一年中，意大利政府继续采取走向战争的危险步骤。它不但根本不制止美国的扩军备战的政策，而且比别人更加甘心充当战争贩子的走狗。每一个意大利人都可以看到准备战争和扩张军备的政策，使得国家格外贫困和反动。群众要求成立一个和平政府的愿望日益增加了。在广大群众的反对日益加剧的情况下，负责执行这种政策的统治集团企图掩饰他们危害国家的行为，加紧笼络人心。但是，这些办法是阻挡不了全国规模的和平运动，阻止不了和平战士为了团结更多的人来保卫和平而采取的具体措施的实现的。在一九五一年最后几个月中，工厂工人进行了顽强艰苦的保护工业的斗争。劳动农民争取土地的斗争击败了政府企图分化农民的阴谋。总工会所发动的反对超额剥削的斗争已进入一个更高的阶段。要使这个运动扩大规模以取得胜利，就必须团结对于这个运动表示关切的全体劳动人民。朗哥强调说：意大利的形势越来越严重，越来越复杂，在这种情况下，共产党、民主团体和广大群众的活动，在保卫和平与意大利劳工和自由方面，具有决定性的意义。
    康斯坦丁尼斯库的文章说：罗马尼亚人民共和国和工人党中央委员会颁布命令，从一月二十八日至三十一日，在国内实行币制改革并减低大宗重要消费品的价格。改革币制的目的在于提高列伊（罗币）的购买力、提高列伊对外币的比值、提高工人和职员的实际工资并改进劳动人民所需要的物资供应。同时，物价的减低对于人民是很大的物质利益，它提高了工人和职员的实际工资。康斯坦丁尼斯库接着指出：一九五二年的币制改革在经济上增强了罗马尼亚的国力，提高了劳动人民的生活水准，并巩固了人民民主制度和国家主权。因此，它受到一切劳动人民的热烈欢迎与赞同。工人阶级和劳动农民再一次看到工人党和人民政府是关心全体劳动人民的生活水准的不断改进的；而劳动群众则越发兴奋地执行一九五二年的经济计划。
    米丁在文章中论述了苏联部长会议颁发一九五一年科学发明和文学艺术方面斯大林奖金的决定。米丁强调说：斯大林奖金的颁发，是苏联社会主义文化蓬勃高涨和百花争放的又一次表现。出现于苏联的一群光辉灿烂的新慧星——斯大林奖金得奖人，再一次显示了苏联的科学发展和资本主义社会中科学情况的天渊之别。苏联的科学改造大自然，创造精良的机器和机械，尽量减轻人的劳动，发明战胜疾病的有效方法；而资本主义社会中的“科学”却在研究大规模屠杀人类的问题，遵奉帝国主义垄断资本家的命令来精心制造最恶毒的大规模毁灭人民的凶器，如化学武器和细菌武器。苏联社会主义文化努力使人民获得知识，培养他们的正直、劳动英雄主义、道德上的纯洁和高尚品质。至于帝国主义的腐朽的“文化”却摧残人们，毒害他们的思想，在人民中间培植仇恨人类的思想，宣扬道德的堕落，迎合最低级的本能，鼓励犯罪。正是因为这个原故，各国进步的人民以厌恶和仇恨的心情唾弃这种腐蚀生命的资本主义“文化”，而以钦敬之心情欢迎苏联在科学和文化方面更加昌盛的消息。
