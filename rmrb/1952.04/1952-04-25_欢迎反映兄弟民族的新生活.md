    Welcome Reports on the New Life of Brotherly Nationalities
    Comrade Editor: After reading the three communications recently published in the People's Daily, "A Tibetan Village Marching Towards Happiness," "The Uyghur People Sing the Praises of Chairman Mao," and "A Surge of Cultural Learning in Rural Southern Xinjiang," I deeply felt the joy and happiness of the brotherly nationalities in their lives after liberation. The Party and the People's Government have brought them a better life than they have ever had, enabling them to "turn the Gobi Desert into fertile farmland." They have unparalleled love and respect for the great people's leader, Chairman Mao. These concise and short communications are welcomed.
    At present, news reports and literary works reflecting the lives of brotherly nationalities are not numerous. Therefore, I earnestly hope that our journalists and literary workers will delve into the areas inhabited by brotherly nationalities and use more communications, literary works, movies, and other forms to reflect their new lives and new things.

    欢迎反映兄弟民族的新生活
    编辑同志：读了人民日报最近刊载的“走向幸福的藏民村”，“维吾尔族人民歌唱毛主席”及“新疆南部农村掀起了学习文化的热潮”等三篇通讯，使我深深感到兄弟民族在解放后生活的欢乐与幸福。党和人民政府带给了他们从来没有过的美好生活，使他们可以把“戈壁沙漠变良田”。他们对于伟大的人民领袖毛主席有着无比的敬爱。这些简洁短小的通讯是受人欢迎的。
    在目前，反映兄弟民族生活方面的新闻通讯和文艺作品是不多的，因此，我热忱地希望我们的新闻工作者和文艺工作者深入兄弟民族区域，多用通讯、文艺作品、电影等形式，反映他们的新生活，新事物。    李牧子
