The Central People's Government has vigorously called for cotton planting and implemented various incentive policies, which have enabled the total national cotton production to exceed the highest year before the Anti-Japanese War, and greatly improved the lives of cotton farmers. Especially after the launch of the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement, a large number of cotton planting models and experts emerged, creating various yield-increasing techniques. These cotton planting models and experts have all achieved excellent results. For example, in 1951, in irrigated cotton fields, Qu Yaoli of Jie County, Shanxi, actually harvested 912 jin per mu, Zhang Qirong of Yuxiang harvested 743 jin per mu, Liang Jiarui of Shijiazhuang, Hebei, harvested 745 jin per mu, and Zhang Defang of Feixiang harvested 763 jin per mu. In 1951, in dryland cotton fields, Shen Huairen of Zhaocheng, Shanxi, also created a record of 578 jin per mu. These achievements show how the people's democratic system has brought into play the creativity and initiative of the working people, enabling us to increase the yield of cotton in both irrigated and dry land by four or five times compared with the past, relying on the ingenious farming methods derived from farmers' practice, without major improvements in production tools. This has increased our confidence in increasing the yield of cotton per unit area, and we also have the courage to catch up with the highest record of 1,800 jin of cotton per mu created by the Soviet Union.

The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government pointed out in the "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952": The basic policy of this year's agricultural production is to concentrate efforts on increasing the yield per unit area, requiring the country to increase cotton production by 20 percent on the basis of 1951. The cotton planting area should be stabilized at the level of 1951, without increasing it. Therefore, improving cotton cultivation techniques is an important method to increase yield per unit area. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government issued a "Directive on Improving Cultivation Techniques to Increase Cotton Yield per Unit Area" on March 31, proposing six improved techniques: preserving soil moisture and preventing drought, timely sowing, rational fertilization, thorough aphid control, maintaining and promoting improved varieties, appropriate close planting, and meticulous pruning. In order to strengthen the technical guidance for cotton planting in the North China cotton area, we have summarized and organized the high-yield cultivation techniques of North China cotton planting models in accordance with the order suggested by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, and raised them to the level of scientific theory as much as possible, for the reference and promotion of cadres, labor models and farmers in the North China cotton area who are leading production. (According to the order of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the sixth item should be "meticulous pruning", but for the convenience of summarizing, we have incorporated it into the second item. We also consider "paying attention to early maturity" as a special problem in North China and changed it to the sixth item.)

(1) Preserving Soil Moisture and Preventing Drought, Timely Sowing

North China lacks rain every spring. In dry years, the cotton planting area will be greatly reduced; even in normal years, many cotton fields lack seedlings. Therefore, drought-resistant sowing and striving for full emergence have become serious issues in local production leadership.

In 1951, under the correct leadership of the People's Government, methods to overcome spring drought and lack of seedlings were discovered from the masses: 1. The "seizing moisture and connecting moisture" method was discovered from the experience of cotton planting models in Handan. In 1951, 17 million mu of cotton were planted in Hebei Province, of which 10 million mu were sown using this method (the remaining 3.5 million mu were irrigated land, and another 3.5 million mu were planted by carrying water). 2. The experience of "precise land preparation, collecting and preserving moisture" was discovered from the cultivation of labor models such as Qu Yaoli. Qu Yaoli was not only able to sow in a timely manner, but also ensured full emergence every year; Liang Jiarui's cotton fields had very few missing seedlings. Their experience corrected the outdated concept that "missing seedlings cannot be prevented, only remedied."

How to seize and connect moisture? First, check the moisture content of the soil. If the color of the subsoil is black, it can be easily kneaded into a ball by hand without dispersing, and the soil brought out by the plow feet is wet and takes a long time to dry, it is called true moisture; if the color of the subsoil is yellow, it cannot be formed into a ball in the hand, and the wet soil brought out by the plow feet dries as soon as it is exposed to the sun, it is called false moisture. Only true moisture can be used for sowing. According to the depth of the moisture, there are also three methods: "one finger sowing, two fingers seizing, and connecting moisture below three fingers." Mastering the moisture situation depends on the experience of eyesight and hand strength, and requires practice. Second, seize the opportunity to sow. Seize the moisture to sow after light rain, or use methods such as plowing dry and sowing wet to plant the seeds in the wet soil; there are also methods such as digging dry holes, using the wet soil at the bottom of the hole to cover the seeds in the previous hole, and then using the wet soil from the next hole to cover the seeds in the hole.

However, in the case of severe spring drought, the moisture contained in the soil is basically not enough. In order to increase the emergence rate when seizing and connecting moisture in dry years, and to further strive for full emergence in normal years, it is also necessary to master precise land preparation, collecting and preserving moisture and sowing techniques. Qu Yaoli's land preparation method is the dryland farming method in North China. There is not a single missing seedling in their fields. Their method is: Autumn plowing is mainly to preserve moisture and loosen the soil. Therefore, after pulling out the stalks after the frost, quickly harrow the land to loosen the soil, and after harrowing, carry out the first autumn plowing. Before freezing, carry out the second autumn plowing, using the original looseness of the land, carry out deep plowing of six or seven inches, so that the subsoil is turned up twice. After each plowing, harrow and rake to make the soil loose and fine, preventing moisture evaporation. Spring plowing after thawing the following year. Spring plowing is mainly to turn the base fertilizer into the soil. Seize the time to start as early as possible when only a few inches have thawed, and only plow three or four inches deep in order to absorb the melted snow water; then harrow and rake to prevent the turned-out wet soil from evaporating. After that, when it rains or at regular intervals, carry out plowing or harrowing, and then rake, to preserve moisture and eliminate weeds. The experience of cotton planting models is that the more times of plowing and harrowing, the better. For example, Qu Yaoli plowed once in autumn and spring, plowed twice, harrowed twice, and raked four times; Liang Jiarui plowed once in autumn and spring, plowed twice, harrowed eight times, and raked four times. They made the ground loose underneath and without small soil clods on the surface, creating a protective soil crust to prevent moisture evaporation. However, in dry years, spring plowing (turning two plows) should not be carried out, but replaced by more harrowing and raking to prevent moisture evaporation from the soil; base fertilizer can be applied later when sowing, or applied in ditches between the sowing rows.

(2) Rational Fertilization, Combined with Irrigation and Pruning

Fertilization and irrigation are the main factors in maintaining soil fertility. Topping and pruning are important measures to avoid excessive growth, prevent shedding of buds and bolls, and promote early maturity. Only when the three are properly coordinated can the yield be significantly increased. Otherwise, if there is too much fertilizer and too little water, the fertilizer cannot be supplied for crop absorption, and the fertilizer effect cannot be fully exerted; if there is too much water and too little fertilizer, it will simply strip the land of its fertility and accelerate the soil's transformation into barrenness. However, if topping and pruning are not carried out after fertilization and irrigation, excessive buds will grow, cotton plants will grow excessively, very few bolls will be formed; or although bolls are formed, many will fall off, mature late, and the yield will be low. Dry land lacks irrigation. In addition to fertilization, topping and pruning, it is also necessary to cultivate carefully and preserve moisture. At present, farmers have very different understandings of these three measures; some farmers have conservative ideas that need to be corrected. For example, farmers in southern Jin believe that fertilization will cause cotton to grow excessively and prolong the spitting time; some farmers in Hebei believe that irrigation only plays a role in saving drought, and the newly dug wells are only irrigated once during sowing; 80% of cotton farmers in Yuxiang, Shanxi, do not know how to top and prune. Some cotton farmers blindly fertilize and irrigate without paying attention to technology, which also needs to be strengthened. For example, Song Chenquan in Handan applied too much cake fertilizer, applying 300 jin of soybean cake and 300 jin of cottonseed cake as base fertilizer, and 250 jin of vegetable cake as top dressing, resulting in good seedlings only after sowing three times; later, the growth was too vigorous, and he did not dare to prune and remove branches, resulting in the shedding of cotton bolls in the lower part of the cotton plants, and the yield was only 460 jin. Li Shunchang in Jie County irrigated without considering the weather, and after watering, it rained for more than a day, and the cotton plants all grew excessively.

In terms of fertilization, labor models have been increasing the amount of base fertilizer year by year. Qu Yaoli applied 9,000 jin of pen manure and sheep manure last year (or an estimated 12,000 jin), and Liang Jiarui applied 9,000 jin of manure last year, plus more than 200 jin of cake fertilizer. The large amount of pen manure they apply is organic fertilizer, which can increase the soil's water storage capacity and granular structure, and the fertilizer is not easily lost and decomposes slowly, and can be continuously supplied for a long time before the cotton spitting. Qu Yaoli's cotton field is slightly alkaline, and Liang Jiarui's is clay loam, which further improves the soil quality due to the effect of organic matter in expanding soil and increasing ground temperature. Applying 9,000 jin of fertilizer to irrigated land is unprecedented; because they are coordinated with irrigation and topping and pruning techniques, they overcome the problem of late maturity due to excessive fertilization and exert a high-yield effect. Liang Jiarui and Zhang Qirong did not apply top dressing before, but both applied it once the year before last, and only changed it to two or three "small and frequent applications" last year. Liang Jiarui applied it three times when the cotton was budding, at the beginning of flowering, and during full bloom. The period of maximum fertilizer absorption is from budding to full bloom; after this, further application will delay maturity. For example, farmers in Cixian only applied top dressing in early August, resulting in only 30% of the cotton bolls cracking.

Regarding fertilization, the following issues also need to be paid attention to:

1. The quality of Qu Yaoli and Liang Jiarui's pen manure needs to be analyzed urgently so that various places can consider increasing or decreasing the amount of pen manure applied based on the quality.

2. How much base fertilizer should be applied to achieve the maximum amount? Still in the exploratory stage; it is necessary to measure soil fertility in various cotton-producing areas and conduct separate experiments.

3. Generally, base fertilizer is applied in spring; in fact, spring plowing is shallow, the fertilizer is not turned into the ground deeply, and the effectiveness is often insufficient due to spring drought. If it is changed to autumn application, the organic fertilizer will ferment and decompose after a winter, which will not only store water, but also be more easily absorbed by crops. The reason why farmers cannot apply it in autumn is that there is not much fertilizer accumulated before winter, and most of the fertilizer is used when planting wheat. If the Soviet method of autumn and spring double application is adopted, with two-thirds applied in autumn and one-third applied in spring, it can be tried because it combines early and late, deep and shallow, and solves the difficulty of accumulating fertilizer.

4. At present, although a large amount of pen manure and soybean cake are used as base fertilizer, they also contain phosphorus and potassium, mainly to supply nitrogen. In order to prevent excessive growth, avoid late maturity, reduce shedding, and form more cotton bolls, it is necessary to prepare a large amount of phosphate fertilizer. However, in the dry, cold, and alkaline soil environment of North China, how much efficacy can bone meal exert? Is it expensive to import superphosphate from abroad? Is it difficult to manufacture it yourself? All of these have reached the stage where they should be considered.

5. Top dressing should be quick-acting fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, cake fertilizer, human manure, and rice bran, and should be combined with superphosphate. Soybean cake must be fermented and decomposed before the fertilizer effect can be quickly exerted. Last year, most areas applied base fertilizer that was not fermented, which attracted seed flies to lay eggs and maggots to eat the young roots and cotyledons. This must be prevented this year, or it should be applied deeply buried before sowing. At present, cotton farmers have a tendency to increase the amount of top dressing significantly, which should be cautiously controlled.

In terms of irrigation, Qu Yaoli's experience is the most prominent. First, irrigation period: He selected to water from mid-June to late August, that is, from the time of seeing buds to the time of spitting, in accordance with the agricultural proverb "to harvest flowers, drought in May and August" (referring to the lunar calendar May and August) and the phenomenon of "Fu Sheng Fu Chang". Second, irrigation frequency and amount of water: He implemented "light watering, frequent watering", and the number of irrigations was coordinated with the rain. Nine times in dry years and six times in wet years. To avoid rain after watering and prevent shedding, watering before boll formation is only two fingers deep, about once every five days; watering after boll formation is four fingers deep, about once every nine days. The next watering should be carried out when the soil surface is mottled and half-dry. His watering experience represents the experience of a large area. We have discovered that labor models in Jie County, Yuxiang, Quwo, and Xia County all use the same watering method. Liang Jiarui's continuous watering during the peak growing season is also similar to Qu Yaoli's experience. They are good at adapting to the North China climate. Cotton in North China cannot be watered early. If it is watered early, the ground will be cool, the seedlings can only grow taller, the roots cannot extend downward, the internodes of cotton plants and fruit branches will be long, and boll formation will be late. Because the frost season comes quickly after the rainy season, if there is more watering in the early stage of growth, branches and leaves will grow, but the buds and flowers have not developed, and there will be no time for boll formation and spitting in the later stage. The last watering should not be too late, as it will delay maturity. The most suitable time is around flowering and boll formation, when the climate is hot, evaporation is high, and cotton plants need the most water. The reason for light watering and frequent watering is: light watering leaves gaps in the soil, which facilitates root respiration and the activity of aerobic microorganisms in the soil; at the same time, the solution concentration does not change much, and nutrients and water are slowly supplied, so that cotton plants do not feel stimulated and avoid a large number of cotton bolls from falling off. Even if it rains after watering, it will not cause excessive growth due to repeated watering. Frequent watering can keep the soil moist at all times, allowing fertilizers to exert their maximum effectiveness, reducing the loss of fertilizer seepage, and preventing the groundwater level from rising and bringing up salt and alkali. Liang Jiarui added two small irrigations during the peak spitting period (during the White Dew and Autumn Equinox) to promote boll growth and rapid opening. These experiences break the outdated theories of even watering during the growing season, no watering during the rainy season, no watering after the Beginning of Autumn, and fewer times but more water.

Whether or not to top and prune is a long-debated issue. The research of Soviet Academician Lysenko has clarified the benefits of topping and pruning. He said: "Topping transfers a large amount of nutrients that are about to enter the terminal buds to the fruit branches, so that the early flower buds do not feel a lack of nutrients, thereby reducing shedding and promoting early maturity. Pruning can accelerate the emergence and development of flower buds, and make more cotton bolls and increase yield. Topping and pruning can be carried out together to remove the fruit branches and excessive buds that grow after topping, which helps the effect of topping." Farmers in North China have been applying a series of techniques such as "removing pants", "removing the apex", "topping", "removing excessive buds", and "timely leaf removal" from the beginning. Especially in the case of increasing fertilizer application and irrigation, topping and pruning are necessary to prevent late maturity and excessive growth.

In addition, a large number of bud and boll shedding is another aspect of the excessive growth phenomenon. At present, labor models have many methods to prevent boll shedding. The boll shedding rate of Liang Jiarui's cotton is only 22.6%, which is 27.4% less than that of ordinary cotton fields in Shijiazhuang. Combining their methods are: 1. Rational irrigation, no watering at noon, to avoid stimulating cotton plants. 2. Replenish watering after continuous rain and sudden sunshine to avoid steaming. 3. Topping and pruning, widening row spacing, so that fruit branches have sufficient nutrients, good ventilation and light. 4. More hoeing in dry land, drainage in waterlogging. 5. Thoroughly control the pink bollworm to prevent damage to buds and bolls. 6. Rational fertilization to avoid excessive or infertile soil. 7. Mid-tillage should avoid being too deep or too late to avoid root damage and peach drop. Mid-tillage should be done after rain.

(3) Thoroughly Control Aphids

Aphids are the biggest enemy of cotton. Cotton plants that are affected by aphids are very short, fruit branches are reduced, fewer bolls are formed in the middle and lower fruit branches, the flowering and spitting period is delayed, and the yield is reduced by 20-30%. Even if it recovers in the later stage, the bolls formed in the upper part will also be late-maturing. Judging from the examples of aphid control by labor models in 1951, some farmers are seriously controlling aphids, and another part has not yet made the determination to "treat early, treat universally, treat continuously, and treat thoroughly." For example, Liang Jiarui and Zhang Qirong controlled aphids very thoroughly, which helped to achieve high yields. Qu Yaoli's cotton fields suffered some aphid damage, otherwise it might have produced more. At the same time, local leading agencies still have many problems in preparing medicines and equipment, and farmers still have many problems in prevention and control methods, which must be solved.

In terms of production leadership: medicine and equipment preparation is the most important key, and aphid control agents should be mainly domestic pesticides with low cost. When cotton aphid soap was promoted in Shanxi last year, farmers initially used it reluctantly with a tentative mentality; then they felt that the drug effect was good, the transportation was convenient, and the price was especially low, so they purchased it in large quantities, making the government rush to handle it. However, it is said that in some areas of Hebei Province last year, drug damage occurred due to improper matching ratio. In order to fully prepare medicines and equipment and prevent drug damage, first, estimate the amount of cotton aphid soap to be prepared according to the number of mu of cotton planting. Those self-made by local oil mills should be inspected at any time during the manufacturing period, unified specifications, and only qualified ones are allowed to be used. Second, before use in each county and district, a drug efficacy test should be conducted on cotton leaves with cotton aphids to determine the local effective concentration from the insecticidal rate. Because the water quality is different, it is not possible to mechanically mix water according to the prescription; if too much water is added, the drug effect will be reduced, and if too little, drug damage will occur. Third, a considerable amount of local tobacco leaves, accounting for 1% of the cotton fields, should be planted in the field, and effective and harmless local medicines, such as the root bark of 洋桃 (Yangtao), should be used as much as possible to supplement the shortage of medicines and equipment. Wheat bran water, wild garlic water, pepper water, etc. have no effect and should be advised not to use them. Fourth, sprayers should be widely promoted in cotton-producing areas, and spare parts for repair should be prepared, and repair stations should be established.

In terms of prevention: weeding is a good measure for pest control. At present, except in villages led by labor models, most areas have not seriously weeded. Farmers in Nangong area of Hebei Province have the habit of digging out weeds and using them as fuel and feed. Local cotton aphids occur late and cause little harm.

In terms of elimination: (1) The period when aphids are harmful is most serious from late May to the first half of July. Before the summer harvest in mid-May, when more than half of the cotton seedlings in the cotton field have aphids, they must be eliminated and controlled; aphids have a high reproduction rate. Killing one at this time can resist hundreds in the future. Generally, two more treatments in mid-June and late June can prevent aphids from running rampant. If it continues to intensify after July, it should be treated once or twice more. (2) Various agents cannot have 100% efficacy. For example, the insecticidal rate of tobacco lime water and cotton aphid soap is about 80-90%. After prevention and control, do not be impatient. The insecticidal efficiency should be checked after 24 hours. After a few days, the remaining aphids will reproduce again, or fly in from other places, and another treatment must be done every ten to fifteen days, the purpose is to make the seedling heart not wither, the leaves not curl, so that the cotton plant can grow normally without being disturbed, not whether there is not a single aphid left. Each treatment must be universal, the operation must be correct, and the drug effect must be reliable. For example, if you only treat the serious places each time, and add up the number of times, claiming to be more than ten times, its effectiveness is not as good as four or five times. (3) When aphids reproduce, ladybugs also develop at the same time. In the cotton field, it is necessary to be able to distinguish ladybugs. All seven-star, thirteen-star, turtle-patterned, and variegated ladybugs can prey on aphids, and they eat a lot, so don't twist them to death at will. Only fourteen-star and twenty-eight-star ladybugs are harmful to other crops and can be twisted to death.

(4) Implement Field Selection

Field selection is a method to prevent varieties from mixing, selecting good varieties from good varieties every year, and continuing to improve the desired excellent traits. Thanks to the advocacy of the People's Government, labor models are gradually enriching this kind of knowledge.

In order to implement the effectiveness of seed selection, it is not enough to be satisfied with only selecting high-yield traits, but also pay attention to early maturity and good quality. Therefore, in terms of high yield, the following should be selected: 1. The plant shape is tower-shaped; 2. The boll is large (five petals and nine seeds) and there are many bolls; 3. There are no disease and insect pest spots and traces. In terms of early maturity, the following should be selected: 1. The plant shape is compact; 2. There are many branches with bolls; 3. The internodes on the main stem and boll-bearing branches are short; 4. The first flower or the first cotton boll blooms early. In terms of quality, the following should be selected: 1. Medium spray flowers, seeds are fat and mature; 2. When the lint petals are pulled apart, the lint heads are long and neat; 3. When the lint petals are kneaded by hand, the lint heads are thick; 4. When the long lint is pulled off, the short hairs on the seeds are dense and do not turn green.

At present, the seed selection methods of labor models still need to be improved. They only select seeds when collecting medium spray flowers, selecting as they watch, selecting many plants, and do not mark them before collecting flowers. We suggest that they should be selected before the medium spray flowers, and marks should be made on the selected cotton plants. In this way, the growth and boll formation of the whole plant can be noted when selecting plants, and one or two more harvests can be made on the same plant. In addition, many areas have mixed other varieties in the process of large-scale reproduction of S cotton, which has reduced its purity. Therefore, seed selection should recognize the original appearance of the variety, so as not to select cotton plants of more than one variety and mix them for replanting; at the same time, when variations in the appearance or quality of the cotton plant are found, it will be possible to distinguish which variety the variation occurred from.

(5) Appropriate Close Planting

Close planting is one of the factors for high yield. We have obtained the following examples from the cotton planting labor models in Shanxi Province in 1951:
High-Yielding  Number of Plants per Mu  Number of Bolls per Plant  Weight per Boll (Qian)  High Yield per Mu (Jin)
Niu Guanxing	1,588	29.2	2.0	529
Pei Yuxi	1,767	29.6	1.8	525
Gan Wenkui	1,785	28.0	1.8	562
Yan Tianhe	2,340	21.9	2.0	642
Zhang Qirong	2,500	24.0	2.0	743
Qu Yaoli	3,160	19.9	2.3	912
Liu Hongyu	4,240	11.8	1.9	597
Linfen Farm	5,100	13.0	1.5	645

The above high-yielding people are all in southern Jin, all irrigated land, and all planted with S cotton, which is convenient for comparison. It shows that: 1. Those with less than 2,000 plants per mu have more bolls per plant, but they are relatively late-maturing and have low total yield. 2. Those with more than 3,000 plants have the highest yield. Those with about 2,500 plants have slightly more bolls per plant than those with more than 3,000 plants, but the total yield is reduced due to the difference of 500-600 plants. 3. Those with more than 4,000 plants also have less yield, because excessive density reduces the number of bolls per plant and the boll weight becomes lighter.

In addition, Zhang Qirong only planted 1,400 plants per mu in 1949, producing 300 jin; in 1950, he changed to planting 1,800 plants, producing 420 jin; last year, he increased it to 2,500 plants, and the yield reached 743 jin. The experimental farm of the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization School planted a large amount of cotton, with 1,500 plants per mu in 1949, with an average yield of 48 jin; 2,500 plants per mu in 1950, producing 163 jin, and last year it was densely planted to 3,600 plants, producing 296 jin; of which the high-yielding ones reached 537 jin.

Based on these experiences, we can point out that in 1952, for irrigated land, those who had less than 2,000 plants before can safely increase the density to 3,000 plants, and those who had 2,500 plants before can increase the density to 3,500 plants. Dry land can have up to 4,000 plants. S cotton is a long fruit branch variety. If the plants are too dense, growth will be excessively suppressed. Generally, 4,000 plants per mu should be the limit for the time being. However, local farms should coordinate with other cultivation methods and conduct further density increase experiments. For the Soviet short fruit branch varieties that have been introduced by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, they should also be compared with S cotton on the basis of close planting to further increase the yield.

The practice of close planting is to "widen row spacing and increase plant spacing." Widening the row spacing can ventilate and light up, facilitate irrigation, apply top dressing, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests, especially in the later stage of mid-tillage, it is convenient to enter and exit, and the depth of hoeing can be freely adjusted. The row spacing should be about two feet. Increasing the plant spacing can inhibit the growth of water branches and promote the development of fruit branches, thus advancing the maturity period. As long as the plant spacing is increased by one inch per mu, the number of plants will increase by 300-400 plants. For example, if the row spacing is two feet and the plant spacing is one foot, there are 3,000 plants per mu; if the plant spacing is changed to nine inches, there are 3,333 plants; eight inches is 3,750 plants; seven and a half inches is 4,000 plants.

Many difficulties may be encountered after close planting. During this period, if the land is not fertile enough due to the increased number of plants, fertilizer should be applied. If the cotton leaves are large and dense, shading the cotton bolls (especially the lower ones), which will make them smaller and lighter, phosphate fertilizer should be applied when top dressing. When the number of bud and boll shedding increases (according to the records of the Linfen Farm, the number of shedding increased to 29%), shedding should be prevented. If irrigation is not appropriate and there are few bolls, the experience of rational irrigation should be adopted. If insect pests increase, they should be thoroughly controlled. If the fruit branches cannot grow fully horizontally, the middle and upper fruit branches should be left shorter and the number of branches should be increased appropriately.

(6) Pay Attention to Early Maturity

The varieties currently planted in large quantities are S cotton No. 4 and S cotton No. 2. They have higher yields and better quality; however, most areas find that they mature late, and the frost flower is generally above 30%. (The fibers of frost flowers are immature and have little value.) If cultivation techniques can be improved, they can also mature earlier. In the same village, we often see that one piece of land is almost harvested, and the neighboring land is still full of green peaches. Qu Yaoli's cotton not only has a high yield, but is also particularly early-maturing; Liang Jiarui's frost flower is only 2.2%, and Zhang Qirong's is only 13.76%. Some labor models can achieve high yields, but have many frost flowers and cannot mature early, which is a big shortcoming.

The reasons why Qu Yaoli and Liang Jiarui's cotton mature early can be analyzed as follows: 1. When they guarantee full emergence, they also guarantee early maturity. They apply a series of methods such as thorough land preparation, strict grain selection, seed scalding and germination, and timely sowing, so that seedlings emerge evenly six or seven days after sowing, which is one week to half a month earlier than ordinary emergence, and the natural maturity period is also advanced. 2. They implemented close planting, which restricted the horizontal growth of cotton plant fruit branches and promoted maturity. 3. Their irrigation is suitable, which makes flowering and boll formation rapid and shortens the flowering and spitting period. 4. Liang Jiarui applied phosphate fertilizer when fertilizing, which directly promotes early maturity. 5. Implement "early thinning, sparse seedling retention, and late seedling fixing" to avoid early growth congestion and less disaster in the seedling stage. 6. Diligent mid-tillage not only removes weeds, but also preserves moisture in drought and regulates moisture in waterlogging, achieving "vigorous seedlings in drought and strong peaches in waterlogging." 7. Topping and pruning controls the growth of cotton plants and tries to reduce boll shedding, so that flowers and bolls bloom and mature early, increasing the number of first-picked flowers and reducing frost flowers. 8. Aphid damage can make the early development of cotton plants abnormal; Liang Jiarui's thorough aphid control is an important factor in preventing late maturity. 9. Continuously select early-maturing cotton peaches in the field for seed.

A good method that has been widely used in Soviet collective farms but has not yet been promoted by us is vernalization. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute tested in 1950 and proved that the spitting can be advanced by five days after vernalization treatment. Labor model Zhang Qirong is ready to try this method.

In addition, it is the urgent task of local farms to improve the S cotton variety or select other varieties to obtain cotton varieties with high yield and early maturity.

    中央人民政府大力号召植棉，实行各种奖励政策，使全国棉花总产量超过了抗日战争以前最高的年份，并且大大地改善了棉农的生活。特别是开展爱国主义丰产竞赛运动以后，涌现出大批植棉模范和能手，创造出各种增产技术。这些植棉模范和能手，都创造了优异的成绩。如一九五一年水地植棉，山西解县曲耀离每亩实收九百一十二斤，虞乡张齐荣每亩实收七百四十三斤，河北石家庄梁家瑞每亩实收七百四十五斤，肥乡张德芳每亩实收七百六十三斤。一九五一年旱地植棉，山西赵城申怀仁也创造了每亩五百七十八斤的纪录。这些成绩，显示出人民民主制度怎样发挥了劳动人民的创造性和积极性，使我们在生产工具没有大的改进的现状下，凭着农民实践中得出的巧妙耕作方法，就使水旱地棉花产量较前提高四、五倍。这使我们提高棉花单位面积产量增加了信心，对于赶上苏联创造的每亩棉花产一千八百斤的最高纪录，也有了勇气。
    中央人民政府政务院在“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”中指出：今年农业生产的基本方针是集中力量提高单位面积产量，要求全国在一九五一年的基础上，增产棉花百分之二十。棉花播种面积要稳定于一九五一年的水平，不予增加。因此，改进棉花的栽培技术是提高单位面积产量的重要方法。中央农业部在三月三十一日发出“关于改进栽培技术提高棉花单位面积产量的指示”，提出保墒防旱、及时播种，合理施肥，彻底治蚜，保持并推广良种，适当密植，精细整枝等六项改进技术的意见。为了加强对华北棉区的植棉技术指导，我们依照中央农业部提示的顺序，把华北植棉模范的丰产栽培技术总结整理，尽可能地提高到科学理论水平，以供华北棉区领导生产的干部、劳动模范和农民群众参考和推广。（依照中央农业部指示的顺序，第六项应为“精细整枝”，为了总结方便，我们把它并入第二项。我们另考虑“注重早熟”是华北的特殊问题，改列为第六项。）
    （一）保墒防旱，及时播种
    华北每年春季缺雨，每遇旱年，棉田播种面积就要大减；即使平常年成，也有很多棉田缺苗。因此，抗旱播种和争取全苗，就成为各地生产领导方面的严重的课题。
    一九五一年，在人民政府正确领导下，从群众中发现了克服春旱和缺苗的方法：一、从邯郸植棉模范的经验中发现了“抢墒接墒”的办法。一九五一年河北省植棉一千七百万亩，其中即有一千万亩是用这个方法播种的（其余三百五十万亩是水地，另三百五十万亩是担水点种的）。二、从曲耀离等劳动模范的耕作中发现了“精密整地、收墒保墒”的经验。曲耀离不仅能作到及时播种，而且历年保证了全苗；梁家瑞的棉田缺苗极少。他们的经验纠正了“缺苗无法预防，只能补救”的陈旧观念。
    怎样抢墒、接墒呢？第一、要验墒。凡底土土色发黑，用手轻握成团不散开，而耧脚带出湿土半天才干的，叫做真墒；底土土色发黄，在手内不能团起，耧脚带出湿土一晒就干的，叫做假墒。真墒才能播种。按墒的深度，还分出“一指耩、二指抢、三指以下用接墒”三种办法。掌握墒情要凭眼力手力的经验，要经过练习。第二、要抓紧播种时机。下小雨后趁墒抢种，或用耠干耩湿等办法把种子耩在湿土里；也有掘开干穴，借用本穴底的湿土盖在前一穴的种子上，再借后一穴湿土盖在本穴种子上等方法。
    但在春旱严重的情况下，土中所含水分基本上是不够用的。为了在旱年抢墒接墒时出苗率多，为了在平常年进一步争取全苗，还必须掌握精密整地、收墒保墒和播种技术。曲耀离等的整地方法是华北地区的旱地耕作法。在他们田内看不见一棵缺苗。他们的方法是：秋耕主要为了保存水分，松软土壤。因此，在霜降拔秸以后就赶紧耙地松土，耙后进行第一次秋耕。上冻以前第二次秋耕，利用原地的松软，进行六、七寸的深耕，使底土分两次翻上来。每次耕后耙平、加耢，使土壤疏松细碎，防止水分蒸发。第二年解冻后春耕。春耕主要是为了把基肥翻入土内。抓紧刚开冻数寸时及早动手，并且只耕深三、四寸，以便吸收溶化的雪水；随即耙耢，以免翻出的湿土蒸发。以后遇雨或隔一定时期，进行耩地或耙地，耩耙后并耢地，一面保蓄水分，一面铲除杂草。植棉模范的经验是耕耙次数愈多愈好。如曲耀离秋春耕各一次、耩两次、耙两次、耢四次；梁家瑞秋春耕各一次、耩两次、耙八次、耢四次。他们使地面下松软地面上无小土块，造成一层保护土皮，防止水分蒸发。但在旱年，春耕（翻二犁）就不要进行，而以多耙多耢来代替，以免土壤中的水分蒸发；基肥可移后在播种时施下，或开沟施于播种行之间。
    （二）合理施肥，配合灌溉、整枝
    施肥和灌溉是保持土壤肥沃的主要因素，摘心整枝是避免疯长、防止蕾铃脱落、促成早熟的重要措施。三者合理配合，才能使产量显著增加。否则，肥多水少，肥料不能供给作物吸收，肥效不能完全发挥；水多肥少，就单纯剥夺地力，使土壤加速变为瘠薄。而施肥灌溉后，不行摘心整枝，就会赘芽丛生，棉株疯长，结铃甚少；或虽结铃而脱落很多，成熟晚，产量低。旱地缺少灌溉，除施肥、摘心整枝外，也要精耕细作，保持水分。目前农民对这三项措施的认识有很大差别；有些农民有保守观念，需要纠正。如晋南部平分农民，认为施肥会使棉花疯长，吐絮时间延长；原、河北部分农民，认为灌溉只是起救旱作用，新打的水井只在播种时灌一次水；山西虞乡有百分之八十棉农不会摘心整枝。有些棉农盲目施肥、灌水，不讲技术，也须加强领导。如邯郸宋成全，施饼肥过多，基肥施豆饼三百斤，棉饼三百斤，追肥施菜饼二百五十斤，致播种三遍才出好苗；以后生长过旺，不敢整枝打杈，致棉株下部棉铃脱落，产量只四百六十斤。解县李顺昌，灌溉不看天时，浇水以后连下一天多雨，棉株都长疯了。
    在施肥方面，劳动模范们把基肥用量逐年增多。曲耀离去年施了九千斤圈粪及羊粪（或估计一万二千斤），梁家瑞去年上了九千斤粪，另外配合饼肥二百多斤。他们大量施用的圈粪是有机质肥料，可以增加土壤蓄水能力及团粒组织，肥分不易流失，分解缓慢，在棉花吐絮前能长期陆续供应。曲耀离的棉田是轻硷地，梁家瑞是粘质壤土，更因有机质有膨软土壤、增加地温的功效，改良了土质。水地施肥九千斤是空前的；由于他们和灌溉、摘心整枝技术相配合，克服了因施肥多而晚熟的毛病，发挥了丰产作用。梁家瑞、张齐荣以前不施追肥，前年都施了一次，去年才改成两三次的“少量分施”。梁家瑞在棉花孕蕾时、初花时、盛花时三次施下。吸肥最多时期，正是孕蕾到盛花；过此再施，就会延迟成熟。如磁县农民到八月初才上追肥，以致棉铃只开裂百分之三十。
    关于施肥，还有以下几个问题亟须注意：
    1、曲耀离、梁家瑞的圈粪质量如何，亟需分析，以便各地施圈粪时依质量好坏斟酌加减。
    2、基肥究竟施用多少才达到最高量？还在摸索阶段；须要在各产棉区测定土壤肥力，分别试验。
    3、一般基肥多在春季施；实际上春耕浅，肥料翻入地下不深，并常因春旱地干，效力发挥不足。若改在秋天施，使有机肥料经过一冬醱酵腐熟，不但能蓄水，更易被作物吸收。农民不能秋施的原因是冬前积肥不多，大部肥料在种麦时用去。如采用苏联的秋春双施的方法，秋施三分之二，春施三分之一，既配合了早晚深浅，又解除了积肥困难，可以试行。
    4、目前大量施圈粪、豆饼做基肥，虽也含磷钾，主要是供给氮素。为了防止疯长、避免晚熟、减少脱落和多结棉铃，必须准备大量磷肥。但在华北干旱、寒冷、多硷性土的环境下，骨粉究能发挥多少效能？从国外输入过磷酸石灰是否昂贵？自己制造有无困难？都已到了应该考虑的阶段。
    5、追肥以硫酸錏、饼肥、人粪、谷糠等速效肥料为宜，并须配合过磷酸石灰。豆饼必须经过发酵腐熟，肥效才能迅速发挥。去年多数地区所施基肥没有发酵、招致种蝇产卵生蛆、食害幼根和子叶。今年必须预防，或在播种前施下深埋。目前棉农有大量增施追肥的倾向，应该慎重地加以控制。
    在灌溉方面，曲耀离的经验最为突出。第一、灌溉时期：他依照“要收花，旱五八”（指夏历五月八月）的农谚和“伏生伏长”的现象，选定在六月中旬到八月下旬浇水，即从见蕾时起到吐絮时止。第二、灌溉次数及灌水量：他实行“轻浇、勤浇”，灌溉次数是与天雨配合的。旱年九次，湿年六次。避免浇后遇雨及防止脱落，未结铃前浇水只二指深，约五天一次；结铃以后浇水四指深，约九天一次。下
    一次浇水的火候，看地皮呈花斑半干状时浇下。他的浇水经验是代表着很大地区的经验的。我们已发现在解县、虞乡、曲沃、夏县一带的劳动模范都是同样浇法。梁家瑞在生育旺期连续浇水，也和曲耀离的经验相近似。他们善于适应华北气候。华北棉花不能早浇，早浇了地凉，苗只能窜高，根不能下伸，棉株和果枝的节间都长，结铃也晚。因为雨期过后很快就到霜降，如果生长前期浇水多，生长了枝叶，并未发育结蕾开花，后期就来不及结铃吐絮。最后一水不能过晚，晚了会延迟成熟。最适宜的时间是在开花前后及结铃时，这时气候炎热，蒸发量大，棉株需水最多。轻浇勤浇的理由是：轻浇使土中留有空隙，便利棉根呼吸及土中好气性微生物的活动；同时，溶液浓度变化不大，养分水分徐徐供应，不使棉株感受刺激，避免棉铃大量脱落。即使浇后遇雨，也不因水分重复而致疯长。勤浇可使土壤经常湿润，肥料可以发挥最大效能，减少肥分下渗的损失，地下水面不致上升，带上盐硷。梁家瑞在吐絮盛期（白露、秋分期间）加浇两小水，可以催铃速开。这些经验，打破了生长期间均匀浇水、雨季不浇、立秋后不浇、以及次数可少、水量要多的陈旧理论。
    应否摘心整枝，是久经争论的问题。苏联李森科院士的研究已经阐明了摘心整枝的利益。他说：“摘心把将进入顶芽的大量养料移送到果枝上去，使早期的花芽不感养料缺乏，因而减少脱落，提早成熟。整枝可使花芽的生出及发育加速，并使多结棉铃，增加产量。摘心整枝合并举行，可把摘心后生出的果枝及赘芽摘去，帮助了摘心的效果。”华北农民自始就应用着“脱裤”“打群尖”“摘心”“除赘芽”“适时摘叶”等一系列技术。特别是在增施肥料、增加灌溉的情况下，为了防止晚熟及疯长，摘心整枝是必须推行的。
    此外，大量落蕾落铃是疯长现象的另一面。目前劳动模范们防止落铃已有很多方法。梁家瑞的棉花蕾铃脱落率只有百分之二十二点六，比石家庄一般棉田少百分之二十七点四。综合他们的方法是：1、合理灌溉，正午不浇，避免棉株受刺激。2、连雨猛晴，追浇一水，避免郁蒸。3、摘心整枝，放宽行距，使果枝养料充分，通风通光良好。4、旱地多锄，涝时排水。5、根治红铃虫，不使侵害蕾铃。6、合理施肥，避免土壤过肥过瘠。7、中耕要避免过深过晚，以免伤根落桃。要在雨后中耕。
    （三）彻底治蚜
    蚜虫是棉花最大的敌人。凡受到蚜害的棉株都很矮小，果枝减少，中下部果枝结铃少，开花吐絮期延迟，产量减少二、三成。后期即使恢复，上部结铃，也形成晚熟。从一九五一年劳动模范们治蚜的例子上看，一部分农民已在认真治蚜，另一部分还未打定“早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的决心。如梁家瑞、张齐荣治蚜很彻底，使丰产得到帮助。曲耀离等的棉田就受了一些蚜害，否则还可能多产。同时，各地领导机关在准备药械上，农民在防治方法上，都还有许多问题，必须解决。
    在生产领导方面：药械准备是最重要的关键，治蚜药剂应以成本低的国产农药为主。去年在山西推行棉蚜皂时，农民最初抱着尝试的心理，勉强使用；随即感觉药效好，运输方便，尤其价格低廉，因而大量购买，使政府赶办不及。但据说去年河北省有的地区因配合比例不适当，发生了药害。为了充分准备药械和防止药害，第一、要依植棉亩数估计，准备足量的棉蚜皂。各地组织油坊自制的，制造期间应随时检查，统一规格，合格的才准使用。第二、各县区使用以前，要用生有棉蚜的棉叶举行药效试验，从杀虫率上决定当地有效浓度。因水质不同，不可机械地照方配水；如果配水过多就要减低药效，过少就会发生药害。第三、要在田内种相当棉田百分之一的土烟叶，并尽量利用有效无害的土药，如洋桃根皮，以补药械之不足。麦糠水、野蒜水、辣椒水等并无效果，应劝导不用。第四、在产棉区应大量推广喷雾器，并准备修理用的零件，设立修配站。
    在预防方面：铲除杂草是防虫的良好措施。目前除在有劳动模范带头的村庄外，多数地区还没有认真除草。河北省南宫地区农民有挖除杂草，用做燃料、饲料的习惯，当地棉蚜发生晚而为害轻。
    在除治方面：（1）蚜虫为害时期，自五月下旬至七月上半月最严重。在五月中下旬夏收以前，棉田内一半以上的棉苗生有蚜虫时，即须动手除治；蚜虫繁殖率大，这时杀死一头可抵将来百头。一般六月中及六月底再治两次，即可使蚜虫不猖獗。七月以后若继续加烈，应加治一二次。（2）各种药剂不可能有百分之百的效力，如烟草石灰水、棉蚜皂杀虫率都在百分之八九十。防治以后，不可性急，检查杀虫效率要在二十四小时以后。再过数日，残余的蚜虫又繁殖了，或从他处又飞来，相隔十天到十五天就须再治一次，目的在使苗心不萎，叶不倒卷，使棉株正常生育不受妨碍，不在蚜虫是否一个不剩。每次治必须普遍，手术必须正确，药效必须确实。如每次只选严重的地方治，而把次数累加起来，号称十多次，其效力并不及四、五次。（3）在蚜虫繁殖时，瓢虫也同时发展。在棉田内要能区别瓢虫，凡七星的、十三星的、龟纹的、异色的都能捕食蚜虫，而且食量很大，不要随意捻死。只有十四星及二十八星的，对其他作物有害，可以捻死。
    （四）贯彻田间选种
    田间选种是使品种不混杂，每年在良种内选良种，继续提高需要的优良性状的方法。由于人民政府的提倡，劳动模范们正在逐步丰富这类知识。
    为了贯彻选种的效能，不能满足于只选丰产的性状，还应注意早熟和品质优良两方面。因此，在丰产方面应选：1、株形是塔形的；2、铃大（五瓣九籽）、铃多的；3、没有病虫害斑点和痕迹的。在早熟方面应选：1、株形紧凑的；2、结铃的枝子多的；3、主干和结铃枝上的节间短的；4、第一朵花或第一棉铃开得早的。在品质方面应选：1、中喷花，种籽肥大成熟的；2、拉开绒瓣，绒头长而整齐的；3、用手揣捏绒瓣，绒头厚的；4、扯去长绒，种子上短毛密不变绿色的。
    目前劳动模范们的选种方法还须改进。他们只在中喷收花时选种，随看随选，选的株数多，收花前不加标志。我们建议要在中喷花以前选定，并在选定的棉株上做好标志。这样选株时可以注意到全株生长及结铃情形，也可在同一株上多收一两次。此外，很多地区在斯字棉大量繁殖过程中，混入了其他品种，把纯度降低了。因此，选种要认识原来品种的外形，以免把一个品种以上的棉株都选出来，混合再种；同时，在发现棉株外形或品质上有变异时，也就能区别这个变异是从那个品种上发生的。
    （五）适当密植
    密植是丰产的因素之一。我们从一九五一年山西省植棉劳动模范中得到以下例证：丰产者  每亩株数  每株吐絮铃数  每铃重量（钱）  每亩丰产斤数牛观星　一五八八　二九·二　二·○　五二九裴玉玺　一七六七　二九·六　一·八　五二五甘文魁　一七八五　二八·○　一·八　五六二阎天合　二三四○　二一·九　二·○　六四二张齐荣　二五○○　二四·○　二·○　七四三曲耀离　三一六○　一九·九　二·三　九一二刘洪玉　四二四○　一一·八　一·九　五九七临汾农场　五一○○　一三·○　一·五　六四五
    上表丰产者都在晋南，都是水地，种的都是斯字棉，便于比较。它说明了：一、每亩二千株以下的，每株铃数虽多，但比较晚熟，总产量低。二、三千多株的，产量最高。二千五百株左右的，每株铃数虽较三千多株的每株铃数略多，但因株数差了五、六百株，就使总产量减低。三、四千株以上的，产量也较少，因为过密使每株结铃数变少，铃重变轻。
    此外，张齐荣一九四九年每亩只种一千四百株，产三百斤；一九五零年改种一千八百株，产量四百二十斤；去年增加到二千五百株，产量就达到七百四十三斤。北京机耕学校实习农场大量植棉，一九四九年每亩一千五百株，平均产四十八斤；一九五零年每亩二千五百株，产一百六十三斤，去年加密到三千六百株，产二百九十六斤；其中丰产的达到五百三十七斤。
    根据这些经验，我们可以指出：一九五二年的水地，凡以前不及二千株的，可以放心加密到三千株，而以前在二千五百株的可以加密到三千五百株。旱地最多可到四千株。斯字棉是长果枝种，植株过密，生长就会过分受到抑制，一般每亩应暂以四千株为止。不过各地农场应配合其它栽培方法，再做加密试验。对于中央农业部已引进的苏联短果枝种，也应在密植的基础上同斯字棉做比较，把产量再提高。
    密植的作法是“放宽行距、加密株距”。放宽行距可以通风通光，便于灌溉、施追肥，防治病虫害，尤其在后期中耕时，出入方便，可自由调节锄地深浅。行距以二尺上下为宜。加密株距可以抑制水杈生长，促进结果枝发育，因此也就提早了成熟期。一亩地内只要株距加密一寸，就使株数增加三、四百株。如行距二尺，株距一尺，每亩是三千株；株距改为九寸，是三三三三株；八寸是三七五○株；七寸五分是四千株。
    密植以后可能发现许多困难。在这期间，如因株数多了地力不足，就应加施肥料。棉叶肥大丛密，荫蔽棉铃（尤其是下层的），会使之变小变轻，就应在追肥时施用磷肥。蕾铃脱落数增加（临汾农场的记载，脱落数增加到百分之二十九）时，就应防止脱落。灌溉不适当，结铃少，就应采用合理灌溉的经验。虫害加多，就应彻底治虫。结果枝不能充分横长，中上部果枝就应留得短些，并酌量多留枝数。
    （六）注重早熟
    目前大量种植的品种是斯字棉四号及斯字棉二号。它们的产量较高，品质较优；但大部地区都嫌它成熟晚，霜后花一般在百分之三十以上。（霜后花的纤维不成熟，使用价值小。）如能提高栽培技术，也可以提早成熟。我们在同一个村子的地里，往往看到一块地已快收净，相邻的地还有青桃累累。曲耀离的棉花不但产量多，还特别早熟；梁家瑞的霜后花只有百分之二点二，张齐荣的只有百分之十三点七六。有的劳动模范虽能丰产，但霜后花多，不能早熟，是很大的缺点。
    曲耀离和梁家瑞的棉花早熟的原因，可以这样分析：一、在他们保证全苗时，也就保证了早熟。他们应用彻底整地，严格粒选，烫种催芽，适时播种等一系列办法，使播种后六、七天就齐苗，比一般出苗要早一星期到半个月，自然成熟期也就提早了。二、他们实行了密植，使棉株果枝横长受到限制，促进成熟。三、他们灌溉适宜，使开花结铃迅速，缩短了开花期和吐絮期。四、梁家瑞施肥时配合磷肥，直接促进早熟。五、实行“早间苗、稀留苗、晚定苗”，避免早期生长的拥挤及幼苗期少受灾害。六、勤中耕，不但除了杂草，并在旱时保存水分，涝时调节水分，做到“旱时苗旺，涝时桃壮”。七、摘心整枝，控制了棉株的生长，并尽力减少落铃，使花铃早开早熟，使第一次收花的数量增多，霜后花减少。八、蚜害会使棉株早期发育不正常；梁家瑞彻底治蚜，是防止了晚熟的一个重要因素。九、连续在田间选早熟的棉桃做种籽。
    有一项在苏联集体农场业已普遍使用，但我们还没有推广的好方法是春化法。华北农业科学研究所在一九五零年试验，证明经过春化处理可提前五天吐絮。劳动模范张齐荣已准备试行这种方法。
    此外，从改良斯字棉种或选择其他品种，得出有丰产兼能早熟的性状的棉花品种，是各地农场的迫切工作。
