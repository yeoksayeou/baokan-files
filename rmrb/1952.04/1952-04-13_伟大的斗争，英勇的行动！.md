Great Struggle, Heroic Action!
    Méi Ruǎotāo
    Since February 29th of this year, American imperialists have continuously invaded our country's airspace with large numbers of military aircraft, repeatedly scattering various insects and other objects carrying germs and viruses in various parts of Northeast China, attempting to slaughter our peaceful residents on a large scale. This despicable and shameless act is the most blatant violation of international law and international conventions, constituting the most serious war crime under international law. This crime of American imperialists is not only shocking but also unprecedented. In terms of international law, the seriousness and vileness of this crime are beyond description!
    However, as legal workers, we value evidence the most. In order to collect concrete evidence of the American aggressors' crime, I participated in the Investigation Group on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism and conducted extensive and in-depth on-the-spot investigations in various parts of Northeast China for half a month. We inspected twenty-one crime scenes, listened to the reports of numerous witnesses, and obtained a large amount of physical evidence, fully confirming the bloody crime of bacteriological massacre committed by the American aggressors against the peaceful residents of Northeast China. In terms of legal conditions, this crime is now supported by very conclusive evidence, leaving no room for doubt! This is the gain of our entire investigation group, and it is also my personal gain.
    For me personally, I have another significant gain, which is: I have further realized the greatness of the Chinese people's struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea! I have further recognized the heroism of our Volunteer Army's actions in going abroad to fight!
    On the morning of March 18th, we went to the north bank of the Yalu River for inspection. Because this area is the most frequently invaded by American aircraft (in Andong, we hear air raid alarms more than three times a day on average), and it is also the place where they scatter the most poisonous insects. There, on the ice and snow, we saw and captured many dead and alive poisonous insects, including flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and black springtails. In such a climate, in such a place, such a large quantity and variety of poisonous insects were found. Apart from being scattered by American aircraft, can any other explanation be found? At this time, the indignation in my heart was beyond words!
    I have been to many places in my life, but this is the first time I have seen the Yalu River. Ah! This world-famous Yalu River is not a turbulent river at all, but only a stream of water with a width of no more than several hundred meters. Across this stream, my sight reached Sinuiju in North Korean territory on the opposite bank, a city that had been bombed and burned by the U.S. military for four days and four nights, and now only a few broken walls and ruins remain. With anger and nostalgia, I stared at it for a long time.
    In that instant, the following question immediately appeared in my mind: Suppose the Korean territory on the opposite bank were occupied by the despicable, filthy, and extremely barbaric American aggressors, could we live and work in peace and enjoy security and freedom just by relying on this narrow strip of water as a barrier? Now that the American aggressors have been driven back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel by the Korean and Chinese forces, thousands of miles away, their air force still continues to use pirate-like sneak attacks to spread bacteria on our territory, attempting to kill large numbers of our peaceful residents and destroy our poultry, livestock, and crops. If those rapacious robbers were stationed on the opposite bank, across the river, within earshot, wouldn't they follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, seeking more after gaining some, and invade us directly? At that time, would it be of any use to talk to them about the principles of international law or respect for territorial sovereignty? Is there any reason, justice, or law to talk about with the robber-like American aggressors?
    Thinking like this, I further realized the greatness of the Chinese people's struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea in the winter of the year before last! I further recognized the heroism of our Volunteer Army's actions in going abroad to meet the enemy! This determination, this action, embodies a high degree of combination of patriotism and internationalism, and also displays the fine tradition of our Chinese people's public spirit, upholding justice and eliminating violence. Giving the aggressors a fierce blow is such a powerful contribution to defending world peace!
    Before leaving the banks of the Yalu River, I gazed at the ruins of Sinuiju across the river, and then looked at the poisonous insects all over the shore. The enemy planes in the clouds high above were buzzing again. At this time, I was extremely excited! In my ears, I seemed to hear the lyrics that my two-year-old daughter was learning to sing:
    "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River.
    Protect peace, defend the motherland, and protect our home!"

    伟大的斗争，英勇的行动！
    梅汝璈
    美帝国主义者自今年二月二十九日起，连续不断地以大批军用飞机侵入我国领空、在我东北各地多次撒布带有传播病菌和病毒的各种昆虫及其他物体、企图大规模地屠杀我国和平居民，这种卑鄙无耻的行为是对国际公法和国际公约最粗暴的破坏，构成国际法上最严重的战争犯罪。美帝国主义者这个犯罪不但骇人听闻，而且是史无前例的。就国际法上说，这个犯罪的严重性和恶劣性是无以复加的！
    但是作为法律工作者，我们最重视的是证据。为了要搜集美国侵略者这个罪行的真凭实据，我参加了美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团，在东北各地进行了半个月的广泛深入的实地调查。我们视察了二十一个罪行现场，听取了无数证人的报告，获得了大量的证物，完全证实了美国侵略者对我东北和平居民所犯的细菌屠杀的血腥罪行。就法律条件上说，这个罪行现在是十分证据确凿、再也没有丝毫怀疑的余地了！这是我们调查团全团的收获，也是我个人的收获。
    对我个人来说，我还有另外一个重大的收获，那便是：我更进一步地体会到中国人民抗美援朝斗争的伟大！更进一步地认识了我志愿军出国作战行动的英勇！
    三月十八日的早晨，我们到鸭绿江北岸去视察。因为这一带是美国飞机最常侵犯的地区（在安东平均每天要听到三次以上的空袭警报），也是他们撒布毒菌昆虫最多的场所。在那里，我们在冰雪上看到了也捕到了许多死的和活的毒虫，其中有苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛和黑跳虫。在这样的气候，在这样的地方，居然发现了这样大量和多种的毒虫，除了美机撒布，还能找得到任何别的解释吗？这时候，我内心的愤慨是不可以言语形容的！
    我生平到过的地方虽不少，但是看到鸭绿江这还是第一次。啊！这举世闻名的鸭绿江原来并不是滔滔大江，而只是一条宽度不过数百米的流水。穿过这条流水，我的视线望到了对岸的朝鲜领土新义州，那是一个曾遭美军四昼四夜的轰炸和燃烧、现在只剩下些断片残垣的城市。我怀着愤怒和怀念的心情，对它注视了很久。
    在这一刹那间，我脑筋里立刻出现了这样的一个问题：假使对岸的朝鲜领土是被那卑鄙龌龊、横蛮透顶的美国侵略军所占领了，仅凭这一衣带水的隔离，我们便可以安居乐业、高枕无忧吗？现在美国侵略军被朝中部队打退到了三八线附近，相隔千里，他们的空军还是继续不断地用海盗式的偷袭来到我国领土上撒布细菌，企图大量杀害我国和平居民和毁灭我们的家禽、家畜和农作物。倘使那些狼心狗肺的强盗们驻扎在隔江相望、鸡犬之声相闻的对岸，他们还不会沿着日本帝国主义的老路，得陇望蜀、长驱直入地来侵犯我们吗？那时候我们再和他们讲什么国际法原理原则，谈什么尊重领土主权，会有丝毫用处吗？对强盗般的美国侵略军还有什么公理、正义或法律可讲吗？
    这样一想，我更加深一层地体会到前年冬天我国人民抗美援朝斗争的伟大！我更进一步地认识了我志愿部队出国迎击敌人行动的英勇！这一决心、这一行动，体现了爱国主义和国际主义精神的高度结合，也发挥了我中国人民急公好义、除暴安良的优良传统。给侵略者以猛烈的打击，这对保卫世界和平是何等有力的贡献！
    在离开鸭绿江畔之前，我凝望着隔江新义州的废墟，再看看沿岸满布的毒虫，高空云层中的敌机又在嗡嗡作响，这时我激动极了！在我耳朵里，我仿佛听见我那两岁的女儿正在学唱的几句歌词：
    “雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江。
    保和平，卫祖国，就是保家乡！”
