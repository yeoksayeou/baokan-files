    ▲ The Shaanxi Province's Shayuan area is a triangular sandy area located where the Luo River flows into the Wei River, spanning Weinan, Dali, and Chaoyi counties, covering an area of 1,600 square li. This sandy area was formed by the Luo River's channel changes and silt accumulation over the years, resembling a desert. Only 80,000 mu of land can be cultivated under the protection of forests. Before liberation, the few forests on these "oases" were severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, resulting in a gradual reduction of arable land area. Some villages were almost submerged by the desert. After liberation, the People's Government established the Shayuan Afforestation Bureau, mobilizing the masses to cooperate with the Bureau in afforestation, with natural villages as units. The plan is to plant 170,000 mu of sand-preventing forests, about 75 million trees, within five years, which can increase the arable land area by 160,000 mu.
    ▲ In order to encourage the large-scale transportation and sale of aquatic products during the fishing season, the Ministry of Railways has obtained approval from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to reduce freight rates for fresh fish and shellfish, as well as salted and dried fish. When fresh fish and shellfish are transported by passenger train as parcels, the freight rate will be reduced by 50% according to the fresh and live parcel freight rate. After the price reduction, the base price per 100 kilograms per kilometer is 82.5 yuan. When salted and dried fish are transported as cargo, whether in full carloads or less-than-carloads, the ordinary cargo freight rate will be reduced by 30%. After the price reduction, the full carload price per ton per kilometer is 313.6 yuan in the North and South, and 208.6 yuan in the Northeast; the less-than-carload price per kilogram per kilometer is 53.2 yuan in the North and South, and 42 yuan in the Northeast. The implementation period is from May 1, 1952, to October 31, 1952.

    ▲陕西省沙苑地区是洛河流入渭河的地方两河之间的一块三角形沙地，地跨渭南、大荔、朝邑三县，面积达一千六百平方里。这块沙地是由洛河多年来河床变迁，流沙淤积而成，像沙漠一样。其中只有八万亩土地在林木保护下可以耕种。解放以前，这些“绿洲”上的不多的林木遭蒋胡匪军破坏很重，耕地面积因而逐渐缩小，有的村庄几乎快被沙漠淹没了。解放后，人民政府在这里设立了沙苑造林局，发动群众以自然村为单位，与造林局合作造林。计划在五年内造防沙林十七万亩，约七千五百万株，可增加耕地面积十六万亩。
    ▲铁道部为了在鱼汛期间鼓励水产鱼介类的大量运销，已请准政务院财政经济委员会，减低鲜鱼介及咸干鱼运价。鲜鱼介类由客车按包裹运送时，按照鲜活包裹运价率减收百分之五十。减价后每百公斤每公里基价为八十二点五元。咸干鱼按货物运送时，不论整车或零担，按普通货物运价率减低百分之三十。减价后整车每吨每公里北方、南方为三百一十三点六元，东北为二百零八点六元；零担每公斤每公里北方、南方为五十三点二元，东北为四十二元。实行期间自一九五二年五月一日至十月三十一日。
