    "American Slaps Are Good"
    Zhang Zhixiang

    There are people who are so servile that they still worship the United States today, believing that the United States is ultimately powerful and can use bacteria to fight wars!

    I once heard a story about an American student who, after returning to China, saw the moon and exclaimed, "The Chinese moon is not as good as the American moon!" His father, hearing this, became angry and slapped him. The student touched his face and said, "Even the slaps are better from America!" According to such a person, even his father would be better if he were American; not being born in America is a lifelong regret for him.

    I used to treat this story as a joke, but today it seems that there are indeed people who praise American slaps as good.

    Are such people ideologically confused and without a standpoint? No. Because they have been gilded in America and are peddling American goods. If they don't say that American gold is bright and American goods are good, they can't raise their own value and can't make a profit from drug dealing. From this perspective, he does indeed have a class standpoint, isn't it obvious?

    But such people deny this, saying that they are "above class" and "above politics," and that they are engaged in pure scholarship and natural science, which has nothing to do with politics. Little do they know that this statement itself is a thoroughly American product.

    Natural science has no class nature, but the people who study natural science have a class nature; just as guns have no class nature, but the people who use guns have a class nature. Guns in the hands of the people can be used for revolution and to suppress counter-revolution, while in the hands of reactionaries they can be used for counter-revolution and to massacre the people. The facts are very clear: Soviet scientists have researched and invented medical techniques that can prolong the lives of people who are clinically dead, while American and Japanese fascist-employed "scientists" are researching and inventing ways to exterminate humanity with bacteria. Can it be said that they are above class?

    Here, there must be a clear class boundary, a boundary between right and wrong, between civilization and barbarism, and between dignity and shamelessness. If these people deny this boundary, have no hatred for the towering crimes of the United States in waging bacteriological warfare, have no sympathy for the people who have been harmed by American bacteria, and insist on praising American bacteriological warfare, then slapping them is in vain. It is best to ask them to sign up with the American warmongers: "I am completely devoted to American bacteriological warfare and am willing to be a test subject, dying without regret." I think the United States will definitely take in such a loyal slave.

    “美国巴掌好”
    张致祥
    有这样的奴才成性的人，到今天还在崇拜美国，认为到底是美国厉害，能够利用细菌打仗！
    我曾听说过一个故事，一个美国留学生，回国之后，看到月亮，慨叹：“中国月亮不如美国月亮好”！他父亲在旁听到生了气，打了他一个耳光，他摸摸脸说：“巴掌也还是美国巴掌好”！在这样的人说来，爸爸也竟是美国的好了，不生在美国，成了他终身的恨事。
    我过去只把这个故事当作笑话，今天看来，确实有称赞美国巴掌好的人。
    这样的人是不是思想糊涂，没有立场呢？不是的。因为他在美国镀过金，贩的是美国货，假如不说美国的金亮，美国的货好，就抬不高自己的身价，就做不成贩毒的买卖。由此看来，他毕竟是有阶级立场的，难道还不明显吗？
    但是这样的人，否认这种说法，说什么他是
    “超阶级”的、“超政治”的，他搞的是纯粹学问、自然科学，与政治无关。岂不知这种说法本身，就是地地道道的美国货。
    自然科学没有阶级性，但是研究自然科学的人是有阶级性的；犹如枪没有阶级性，但是使用枪的人却是有阶级性的一样，枪杆子掌握在人民手里可以革命，可以镇压反革命，掌握在反动派手里可以反革命，屠杀人民。事实很明显，苏联的科学家研究发明了可以给症象死亡的人延续生命的医术，而美国和日本法西斯御用的“科学家”，却在研究发明如何用细菌灭绝人类。难道能说他们是超阶级的吗？
    这里必须有一个明确的阶级界限，是非界限，文明和野蛮、庄严和无耻的界限。假如这些人否认这种界限，对于美国进行的细菌战的滔天罪行没有仇恨，对于遭到美国细菌残害的人民毫无同情，一定要称赞美国的细菌战，那么你打他一个耳光也是枉然的，最好请他向美国战争贩子去报名：“本人对美国细菌战五体投地，愿供试验，死而无怨。”我想，美国对于这样忠实的奴才，是定会收留的。
