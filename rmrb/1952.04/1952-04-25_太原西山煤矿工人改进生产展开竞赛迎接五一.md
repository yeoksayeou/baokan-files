    Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine Workers Improve Production and Launch Competition to Greet May Day
    Editor: Since the "Three-Anti" campaign, our Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine has seen a new atmosphere. In March, all the workers of the mine created five new records and overfulfilled the production task for the first quarter. On April 12th, the daily output of Songshukeng reached 1,720 tons, and the daily output of the second mine reached 1,130 tons, breaking the highest record in decades. The leadership hung two red flags at the entrances of the two mines. The workers happily said: This campaign has not only promoted production, but also improved our lives. The steamed buns in the canteen are bigger, the vinegar in the cooperative is more sour, and the medicines in the clinic are better.

    With the improvement of the working class's awareness, six or seven backward groups in each mine have become advanced production groups. Technicians and workers have put forward reasonable suggestions. For example, in terms of roadways in the mines, changing the single track to double track and changing the turntables to switches have increased the daily coal output of the two mines by more than 400 tons. The workers of Songshukeng improved the operating method of coal recovery, changing the 15-meter broken cave to 10 meters, and recovering from the rear every two meters. This not only ensures safety but also recovers more than 100 tons of coal per day, increasing the recovery rate by 20 percent. Now, all the workers of the mine are launching a large-scale production competition to greet their own holiday – "May Day" Labor Day – with even better results.

### 太原西山煤矿工人改进生产展开竞赛迎接五一

    太原西山煤矿工人改进生产展开竞赛迎接五一
    编辑同志：我们太原西山煤矿经过“三反”运动，出现了新气象。全矿职工在三月份创造了五次新纪录，超额完成第一季度的生产任务。四月十二日，松树坑日产量达到一千七百二十吨，二坑日产量达到一千一百三十吨，打破数十年来的最高纪录。领导方面在两个坑口处挂了两面红旗。工人们高兴地说：这次运动不只推动了生产，把我们的生活也改善了，食堂的馒头也大了，合作社的醋也酸了，医疗所的药品也好了。
    随着工人阶级觉悟的提高，各坑内六、七个落后小组，变成了生产先进小组。技术员、工人纷纷提出合理化建议。比如在坑内巷道方面，把单轨改为双轨，把转盘改为岔子，就使两个坑每天多产煤炭四百多吨。松树坑工人改进了回采煤的操作方法，把十五公尺的破方洞改为十公尺，每隔两公尺从后回采。这既保证了安全，每天又能多回收煤一百多吨，回收率提高百分之二十。现在，全矿职工正在展开大生产竞赛，以更好的成绩迎接自己的节日——“五一”劳动节。
