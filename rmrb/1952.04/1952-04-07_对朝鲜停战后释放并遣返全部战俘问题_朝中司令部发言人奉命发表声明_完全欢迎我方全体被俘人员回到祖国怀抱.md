Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: The spokesperson of the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, upon order, issued a statement on the question of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the Korean armistice. The full text is as follows:

    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have always advocated that after the cessation of active hostilities, both sides of the belligerents should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by each side. This reasonable proposition will not be altered in any way because some of our captured personnel, during their detention, tattooed their arms, wrote certain documents, or engaged in other similar acts. We deeply understand that these acts were by no means voluntary on their part and that they should not be held responsible for them. We fully welcome all our captured personnel back to the embrace of the motherland. We have also guaranteed in the agreement with the other side that all captured personnel will be reunited with their families after repatriation, participate in peaceful construction, and live peaceful lives.

    对朝鲜停战后释放并遣返全部战俘问题
    朝中司令部发言人奉命发表声明
    完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国怀抱
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人，奉命对朝鲜停战后释放并遣返全部战俘问题发表声明，全文如下：
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一向主张在积极的敌对行为停止后，交战双方应迅速释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘。这种合理主张，绝不因我方被俘人员在拘留期间，曾有一部分人在臂上刺字，或写下某种文件，或作其他类似的行为而有所改变。我们深知这些行为绝非出于他们的自愿，不应由他们负责。我们完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国的怀抱。我们并已在与对方的协议中，保证全部被俘人员在遣返后与其家人团聚，参加和平建设事业，并过和平生活。
