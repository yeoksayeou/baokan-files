    I Want to Start Anew
    Wu Feng Self-Account
    Fu Dong Record

    My name is Wu Feng. Although I am only twenty years old, I have already committed a serious crime of corruption. I am a corrupt official who embezzled 120 million yuan. I am grateful to the leadership and comrades for rescuing me from the abyss of sin; when the leadership announced that I would be exempt from criminal punishment because I voluntarily confessed and also exposed others, I was overwhelmed with emotion and cried. I want to continue to atone for my sins and start anew.

    Now, every time I think about how I embarked on the road of corruption, I break out in a cold sweat. In 1950, the leadership sent me to the Xizhimen construction site in Beijing to inspect materials. Liu Yi, the deputy manager of Yongtai Construction Company, which contracted the project, asked me in secret a few days after we met: Who is a member of the Youth League? Who is a party member? What is your family situation? In short, he was trying to "figure out" our psychology and hobbies all day long. He called us "great engineer" and "chief engineer" all the time. He knew I liked to dance, so he asked his wife to wear new clothes and dance with us. He really knew how to find cracks to breed maggots. One day, when inspecting materials, he tried to pass off bad wood as good wood. When I disagreed and refused to stamp it, he pulled me aside and said to me, "Little brother, this material can still be used." As he spoke, he stuffed a roll of money into my hand. He said with a smile: "This is just a small token of appreciation, I hope you can help me more in the future, little brother!" My heart suddenly felt cold and then hot, like a pot of boiling porridge. I knew it was illegal to do so, but I didn't want to return the money. While I was hesitating, the private merchant seized my hand, stamped the wood with a "qualified" mark, and said, "Forget it, forget it, little brother, we'll talk about it later." Near the completion of the project, a supervisor from the construction company sent me two million yuan, saying, "This is money that our manager borrowed from you. He asked me to return it to you." In fact, it was a bribe to me. This was the beginning of my series of corrupt acts. In June, I was transferred to work in the import and export building construction area. The contractor, Chen Chengde, exploited the hedonistic thoughts of me and other corrupt individuals in the case, and would give us whatever we wanted. His construction site director brought a camera from Shanghai. Knowing that I liked this gadget, he said to me, "You can borrow it." After some time, he said to me again, "If you like it, consider it yours." I was captured by him. Later, whenever construction should not have been stopped, I would report that it should be stopped, in order to reduce their penalties for delays. I allowed them to use state-owned cement when they should have used private merchants' lime. I didn't care if the stones were not washed clean. Later, it developed into a situation where the director of the engineering office, the director of the North China Engineering Department, and I, a total of fourteen people, colluded to steal steel bars and cement worth six or seven hundred million yuan from the state. I received forty million yuan that time. All in all, the unscrupulous merchants stuffed 126.05 million yuan into my pocket.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement began, I panicked. I secretly went to the construction site director (the head of the corruption ring) to ask him what to do. He said nonchalantly, "Don't worry, we'll find the contractor tonight to talk about it and ask them to write a letter to the organization, stating that they have never bribed the construction site cadres. Wouldn't that solve the problem?" In this way, we and the contractor formed what we thought was an unbreakable "offensive and defensive alliance." In meetings large and small, I insisted, "I have no problems." When comrades patiently mobilized me to confess, I even said, "If it is found that I am corrupt, I would rather be shot." And I proposed to accuse those who mobilized me to confess to the organization. Although my mouth was so hard, my heart was trembling. I was constantly muttering to myself, "The movement is about to pass, maybe it doesn't matter if I don't confess. How can such a big problem be dealt with if I confess! At the very least, I would be sentenced to life imprisonment." So I gritted my teeth and refused to confess.

    I saw corrupt officials who resolutely refused to confess being arrested and dealt with according to the law. I was forced to confess a little bit of my personal small problems in the group meeting. The head of the corruption ring secretly told me to say less. Later, some of my accomplices were arrested, and some were placed under surveillance. Thinking of the paths of Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu, I plucked up my courage and wanted to confess. But the words of the head of the corruption ring weighed heavily on my heart: "If you confess, I will pin my problems on you." So I thought again, "No, I still can't confess. If all the problems are pinned on me alone, then I will surely die." While I was hesitating, the overall head of our corruption ring (he was then the deputy director of the Savings and Inspection Committee of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade) again "instructed" me: "You are only allowed to talk about your own problems, not everyone else's." I returned to the group and confessed some more of my personal problems. The masses still didn't approve, and opinions came like waves, one after another. Should I confess or not? The internal conflict made me unable to lift my head.

    Just then, I suddenly got appendicitis. I thought to myself: Someone like me, a criminal who has committed serious corruption and doesn't want to confess, his life or death is not worth anyone's concern. However, the leadership sent me to the hospital. Lying in the hospital bed, I thought a lot: I thought of the honorary plaque my family received when my sister joined the army last year, I thought of the newly built factories, I thought of the "mighty and high-spirited, crossing the Yalu River" Volunteer Army, I thought of the Huai River construction workers... I also thought, what if the houses I was responsible for building collapsed and crushed people to death? Wouldn't I be as hateful as the unscrupulous merchants who harmed the Volunteer Army? I hated myself for doing so many unconscionable things! I also remembered that since the beginning of the movement, six or seven leading comrades had held more than twenty sincere and serious talks with me, repeatedly explaining the policies to me, pointing out the future; and I remembered the cartoon of "Little Wu Feng walking on the bright road" that they drew to encourage me. What were they doing all this for! Wasn't it all to make me start anew!

    Slowly, I figured it out. Before the deadline for confession, I laid all my ugly and dirty things before the masses, and I returned the embezzled money. I exposed the remaining dozen or so corrupt officials. This was the beginning of my starting anew.

    Since I was a child, I lived a life of having my meals served and my clothes put on for me. What I cared about was: how to wear clothes more beautifully, how to eat more exquisitely. After participating in revolutionary work, I only looked at movie and theater advertisements when I picked up the newspaper, and regarded learning as a painful thing! So I was quickly dragged down by unscrupulous merchants. In the future, I must work hard to transform myself, start anew, and continue to atone for my sins!

    我要重新作人
    吴枫  自述
    傅冬  记
    我叫吴枫。虽然我才二十岁，却已经犯了严重的贪污罪。我是一个贪污了一亿二千万元的贪污犯。感谢上级和同志们，把我从罪恶的深渊里拯救出来；当上级宣布我因自动坦白，而且还检举了别人，决定免予刑事处分时，万感交集，我哭了。我要继续立功赎罪，重新作人。
    现在，我每次想起自己是怎样走上贪污道路的时候，浑身就要出汗。一九五零年上级派我到北京西直门建仓工地做验收材料工作。承包工程的永泰营造厂副经理刘艺，见面没几天就在背地里问我：谁是团员？谁是党员？家庭状况怎样？总之整天在“捉摸”我们的心理和爱好。一口一个“大工程师”、“总工程师”。他知道我爱跳舞，就叫他的老婆穿着新衣服来陪我们跳。他真会找缝下蛆。有一天在验收材料时，他拿坏木料顶好木料，我不同意，不给打印，他就把我拉到一边，对我说：“小弟弟，这料子也能使。”说着就往我手里塞了一卷票子。他笑着说：“这是点小意思，以后还请小弟弟多多帮忙！”我心里一下子冷，一下子热，七上八下像一锅滚开了的粥。明知这样作是违法的，可是又不愿把钱退回去。我心里正在打转，私商就趁机把着我的手，在木料上盖了“合格”的印记，并且说：“算了，算了，小弟弟以后再说。”快完工的时候，营造厂的一个监工员给我送来两百万元，还说：“这是我们经理借的你的钱。他叫我还你。”其实是向我行贿。这是我一连串贪污行为的开端。六月我被调到进出口大楼工区工作。包商陈成德抓住了我以及和我同案的贪污分子的享乐思想，你想要什么他就给送来什么。他的工地主任从上海带来的一个照像机，他知道我喜欢这玩意儿，就对我说：“借给你用。”过了一些时候，又对我说：“如果你喜欢，就算是你的。”我被他俘掳了。以后，凡施工中不该停工的事，我就报该停工，来减少他们的误工罚款。该用私商的石灰，我却让他们用公家的洋灰。石子洗不干净，我也不管。以后发展到工程室的主任、华北工程处处长和我共十四人串成一条线，盗卖了国家价值六、七亿元的钢筋和洋灰。那次我分得四千万元。前前后后奸商往我的口袋里塞了一亿二千六百零五万元。
    “三反”运动开始后，我心里发慌，偷偷遛去找工地主任（贪污集团的头子）问他怎么办，他满不在乎地说：“你放心好了，今晚我们找包商来谈谈，让他们给组织上写封信，表明没向工地干部行过贿，那不就解决问题了吗？”就这样我们和包商订了自以为牢不可破的“攻守同盟”。我在大小会上就一口咬定“我没问题”。同志们耐心地动员我坦白时，我甚至说：“如果查出来我贪污，我情愿被枪毙。”并且提出要向组织上控告动员我坦白的人。我的嘴这样硬，心里却直发抖，我一天到晚心里在念叨：“运动就快过去了，不谈也许不要紧。这么大的问题谈出来怎么得了呀！起码也得判个无期徒刑。”于是我就咬紧牙关不坦白。
    我看到坚决不坦白的贪污犯被逮捕法办了。我迫不得已在小组会交代了一小点我个人的小问题。贪污集团的头子暗地里叫我少说话。后来我的同谋者有的被捕了，有的被管制了。我想起夏茂如、杭效祖的路，我鼓起勇气，想坦白。但贪污集团的头子对我说的话，又沉重地压在我的心头：“如果你谈了，我就把我的问题扣在你身上。”于是我又想：“不，还是不能谈。如果把问题都扣在我一个人头上，那就准死无疑了。”我正在拿不定主意的时候，我们的贪污集团总头子（他那时是贸易部工程处节约检查委员会的副主任委员）又“指示”我：“只许说你自己的，不许说大家的。”我回到小组又坦白了一些我个人的问题。群众还是通不过，意见像浪潮一样一个接一个地打来。说呢，不说呢？内心的矛盾使我抬不起头来。
    就在这时候，我突然得了盲肠炎。我心里想：像我这样一个犯有严重贪污罪行而又不想坦白的罪犯，他的死活，是不值得谁来关心的。可是，上级把我送到医院里。我躺在病床上想了很多：想起妹妹去年参军时家里获得的光荣匾，想起新起的一个个工厂，想起“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江”的志愿军，想起治淮民工……我又想到我负责修建的那些房子如果塌了压死人怎么办？我不是和陷害志愿军的奸商一样的可恨吗？我恨我自己干了这么多伤天害理的事！我又想起，自从运动开始以来，六、七位领导同志和我作了二十多次诚恳严肃的谈话，他们反复地向我说明政策，指出前途；又想起他们为鼓励我而画的“小吴枫走在光明大道上”的漫画，他们为的是什么呀！还不是为的叫我重新作人！
    慢慢地，我想通了。就在坦白期限前，我把我所有的丑脏东西，都摆在群众面前，我退了赃款。我检举了其余的十几个贪污犯。这是我重新作人的开始。
    我从小过着饭来张嘴，衣来伸手的生活，我关心的是：如何把衣服穿得漂亮些，吃得讲究些。参加革命工作后，拿起报纸也只是看看电影和戏剧广告，把学习看成痛苦的事！所以很快地被奸商拖下水。今后我一定要努力改造自己，重新作人，继续立功赎罪！
