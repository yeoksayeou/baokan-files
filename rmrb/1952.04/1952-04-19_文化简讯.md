Cultural Briefs

	▲ In Shanghai, the "Five-Anti" ideological education in secondary schools has been comprehensively and systematically carried out since the spring break. The first phase of the task focuses on explaining the egregious crimes of rampant attacks by illegal bourgeois elements, pointing out the great significance of the "Five-Anti" movement, and requiring the majority of students to actively study and face the development of the "Five-Anti" movement squarely. After listening to Mayor Chen Yi's broadcast and receiving education from various sources, the teachers and students of each school have generally completed this phase of the task. Most schools have students persuading illegal parents to make thorough confessions or publicizing moving stories of the "Five-Anti" movement to their families. Most students have come to understand the significance of the "Five-Anti" movement, support the "Five-Anti" movement, and actively study. The bourgeois fallacies and rumors brought by students from outside the school have been greatly reduced. The "Five-Anti" Propaganda Corps Education Work Brigade has determined that the purpose and requirements of the second phase of "Five-Anti" education is to conduct policy education and standpoint education, so that students, after correctly understanding the "Five-Anti" principles and policies, can actively publicize them to their families and friends. The second phase of the "Five-Anti" education in Shanghai secondary schools began on the 16th of this month.

	▲ The Research Department of Harbin Medical University compiled and published the first collection of "The Development of Pavlovian Theory" in November of last year, and the second collection was compiled in April of this year. These two books include a total of more than fifty papers on Pavlovian theory. They not only introduce the role of Pavlovian theory in basic sciences such as physiology, pathology, immunology, and pharmacology, but also provide fairly detailed introductions to the role of Pavlovian theory in clinical disciplines such as internal medicine (especially neurology), surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, otolaryngology, and even health care.

	▲ The small publication "Songs," jointly compiled by the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Musicians Association, was published in Beijing on April 16th with its inaugural issue. To meet the needs of the "May Day" Labor Day, the journal selected and published eleven mass songs suitable for singing during "May Day." These songs include themes covering the elimination of germ warfare, repelling the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, worker production increase, rural drought prevention and resistance, and the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. Among them, there are two children's songs that can also be used for singing during "June 1st" Children's Day. The journal is published by the People's Literature Publishing House and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore.
