Tianhe Coal Mine Workers' Awareness Increased After "Three-Anti" Campaign, New Atmosphere Appears on the Production Front

Editor: After the victory of the "tiger-beating" campaign by the workers of Tianhe Coal Mine in Jiangxi, a new atmosphere immediately emerged on the production front. On March 1st and 6th, the coal miners created two new coal mining records: the first time they mined 83 tons, and the second time they mined 86 tons. The land transport section exceeded the planned transportation figure by more than 93% in early March. Wang Shuqin, the leader of the foundry team in the mechanical and electrical section, accepted the task of "overhauling eight boiler foot frames" in February. The comrades in the team felt that it would be difficult to complete the task due to the lack of materials, tools, and experience. Wang Shuqin said: "We must overcome the difficulties." They began to experiment. The first time failed because the blast force for melting iron was insufficient, and the second time failed because the furnace opening for melting iron was too large. They persevered and added an inverted "V" shaped iron plate to the furnace opening to block the iron's impact force, and the third experiment was successful. With the progress of the movement, the workers' welfare has also improved. In the past, the workers' dormitories leaked rain, the bathhouse was drafty, and the clinic required workers to pay before seeing a doctor. These problems have been resolved. The workers are now putting forward the slogans of "thoroughly beat the tigers" and "work hard in production" to strive to create even higher production records.

    天河煤矿工人经过“三反”觉悟提高
    生产战线上出现了新气象
    编辑同志：江西天河煤矿职工打“虎”获胜后，在生产战线上立即出现了一片新气象。三月一日、六日，采煤工人创造了两次采煤的新纪录：第一次采煤八十三吨，第二次采煤八十六吨。陆运股在三月上旬运输数字超过应运数字的百分之九十三多。机电股铸工间组长王书琴在二月份接受了“翻锅炉脚架子八只”的任务，组里同志都觉得缺乏材料、工具，又缺乏经验，不容易完成任务。王书琴说：“我们一定要克服困难。”他们开始了试验。第一次因化铁水风力不够，第二次因化铁水炉口太大，都失败了。他们再接再厉，想法在炉口上加了一个人字铁板，塞住了铁水的冲力，第三次就试验成功了。随着运动的进展，工人的福利也改善了。过去工人宿舍漏雨，洗澡塘四面通风，医务所要工人先交钱后看病，这些问题都得到了解决。工人们现在提出了“打尽老虎”“努力生产”的口号，争取创造更高的生产纪录。　                旷坚
