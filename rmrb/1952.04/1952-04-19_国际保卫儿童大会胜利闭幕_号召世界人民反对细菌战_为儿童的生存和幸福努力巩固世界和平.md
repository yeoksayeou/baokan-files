Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 18th: The International Children's Defense Conference concluded on the 16th, according to TASS. The conference unanimously adopted resolutions on children's education, healthcare, and the impact of literature, newspapers, radio, film, and art on children's spiritual and cultural development, and issued an appeal to all men and women worldwide. At the closing meeting, the Egyptian delegation, on behalf of all attendees, expressed warm gratitude to the International Initiating Committee for preparing and organizing this conference, and wished the committee great achievements in its work of defending children's rights to survival, health, and education.

Finally, Mrs. Gordon, a member of the International Initiating Committee, delivered a closing speech, expressing gratitude to the Austrian Association for the Protection of Children for its hospitality and assistance, and emphasized the great significance of this conference. She said: This conference demonstrated the will of millions of men and women, with different political views and religious beliefs, to fight for protecting children from the threat of war and hunger, and for striving for a happy future for the younger generation.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 18th: The International Children's Defense Conference at its final meeting unanimously adopted an appeal to all men and women worldwide, stating: Today, millions of children—humanity's most valuable asset—have become victims of hunger, ignorance, terror, and death.

In Japan and Syria, thousands of parents are forced to sell their children due to poverty. In many countries, children have to fend for themselves from childhood. The magnificent Iranian carpets owned by the world's wealthy are woven by the small hands of tens of thousands of hungry children.

Throughout Africa, Latin America, and most of Asia, millions of children have no bread, no home, and receive no care; more than half of them die at the age of two or three, before they even begin to realize they are alive. Other children live in ignorance: in 1952, 50 percent of all children are unable to read or write.

The appeal to all men and women worldwide discussed the plight of children in the United States and Western Europe, saying: According to official statistics, in the United States, one in four families lives in unsanitary housing. In France, Britain, and Norway, living standards are constantly declining. In Italy, four million children live in caves or shacks. The preparation for war and the ever-increasing military budgets are the cause of the growing poverty in these countries.

In Greece and Spain, thousands of innocent children are tortured in prisons and concentration camps; the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are brutally destroying children.

We are deeply shocked after hearing the accusations of the representatives of Korea and China against the American troops for the terrible crimes of using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people under the cover of the United Nations flag.

We know that the US government has not yet ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare; and we know that the US authorities have openly admitted that they are using huge sums of money to manufacture bacteriological weapons.

If all of humanity does not unite to stop our history from being written with the blood of our children, then the terrible fate that the children of Korea and China are experiencing today may befall our children, your children, and the men and women to whom we are now appealing tomorrow.

The earth is fertile enough to feed all the children in the world. Science and technology can seek a happy life for all children. Some countries, although they suffered terrible destruction in the last world war, their children live happily, they grow up day by day, full of confidence in their future.

The appeal to all men and women worldwide concludes: Let us put all our strength, let us unite together, and work together to fight for the rights of all children in the world to survival, happiness, and the development of wisdom and morality.

Strive to make the governments of all countries guarantee these rights, let us fight to enact laws protecting children all over the world, and to strengthen the existing laws concerning children.

Demand that countries use large amounts of budget funds for social and cultural needs, for maternal and child welfare, rather than for expanding armaments.

Expose and publicly condemn the promotion of racial discrimination, violent actions, and war in schools, children's books, movies, and radio broadcasts.

In order to save our children, let us use all our strength to restore and consolidate international peace!

Demand that the governments of all countries stop the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya that are causing the deaths of children.

Demand that the United Nations Disarmament Committee reduce the unlimited expansion of military budgets, and use such funds to meet the needs of children. Denounce the monstrous crimes of mass slaughter of children, and demand the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons.

Demand that all countries in the world sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare.

Uphold the right of the people of the colonies to fight for freedom from the shackles that bind them and force them to sacrifice their children.

People of the world, let us strengthen our fraternal cooperation to save the children!

Establish national committees for the defense of children in all countries around the world, and add more local committees for the defense of children.

Every city, factory, and village must hold powerful demonstrations on June 1st—International Children's Day—in support of peace, and in support of mutual trust and confidence among the people of the world.

    国际保卫儿童大会胜利闭幕
    号召世界人民反对细菌战
    为儿童的生存和幸福努力巩固世界和平
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际保卫儿童大会已在十六日闭幕。大会一致通过了关于儿童的教育、保健以及文学、报纸、无线电、电影和艺术对于儿童精神和文化发展的影响的决议，并发表了告全世界男女书。在闭幕会议上，埃及代表团代表全体到会者，对国际发起人委员会筹备和组织这次大会，表示热烈的感谢；并祝这个委员会在保卫儿童的生存权利、健康和教育的工作中获得巨大的成就。
    最后国际发起人委员会委员戈登夫人致闭幕词，她对奥地利保卫儿童协会的招待和协助表示感谢，并强调指出这次大会的重大意义。她说：这次大会表明了千百万政治见解与宗教信仰不同的男女为保卫儿童不受战争和饥饿的威胁，为争取年青一代的幸福前途而斗争的意志。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社维也纳十八日讯：国际保卫儿童大会末次会议一致通过告全世界男女书说：今天，有千百万儿童——人类最宝贵的财产——变成了饥饿、愚昧、恐怖和死亡的牺牲品。
    在日本和叙利亚，成千上万的父母因为贫困而不得不出卖他们的孩子。在许多国家中，儿童们不得不从童年起就自行谋生。那些为全世界富人所有的华贵的伊朗地毯，就是由成千成万饥饿的儿童的小手组成的。
    在整个非洲，在拉丁美洲，在亚洲的大部地区，千百万个儿童没有面包，没有家，得不到照顾；其中一半以上在两三岁的时候，在他们开始认识到自己是活着以前就死去了。其他的儿童则无知地生活着：在一九五二年，全部儿童中有百分之五十不能念书写字。
    告全世界男女书谈到美国和西欧儿童的处境说：根据官方统计数字，在美国，每四个家庭中就有一个家庭住在不卫生的住所里。在法国、英国和挪威，生活水准不断下降。在意大利，四百万儿童住在洞穴或茅屋中。备战和不断增加的军事预算，是造成这些国家日益贫困的原因。
    在希腊和西班牙，成千的无辜儿童在监狱和集中营中遭受折磨；朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争残暴地毁灭着儿童。
    我们听取了朝鲜和中国代表控诉美国军队在联合国旗帜掩盖下对朝鲜和中国人民使用细菌武器的可怕罪行之后，深为震惊。
    我们知道，美国政府迄未批准一九二五年禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书；并且知道美国当局曾公开承认他们以巨额经费用于制造细菌武器。
    如果整个人类不团结一致来制止用我们孩子的鲜血写下我们的历史，那么朝鲜和中国儿童所遭遇的可怖命运明天就可能降临到我们的孩子、你们的孩子的头上，也可能降临到我们现在所呼吁的男女的头上。
    大地是富饶的，足以供养全世界所有的儿童。科学和技术可以为所有儿童谋求幸福的生活。有些国家，虽然在上次世界大战中遭受了可怕的破坏，但是它们的儿童却快乐地生活着，他们一天天成长起来，对于自己的将来，满怀着信心。
    告全世界男女书最后说：让我们拿出我们的一切力量，让我们团结在一起，共同努力，为全世界所有的儿童争取他们的生存、幸福和发展智慧与道德的权利。
    努力使全世界各国政府保障这些权利，让我们为使全世界各地都颁布保护儿童的法律，为加强原有的关于儿童的法律而奋斗。
    要求各国把大笔的预算款项用于社会和文化需要，用于妇婴福利，而不用于扩张军备。
    揭发并公开地斥责在学校、儿童读物、电影和无线电广播中所进行的种族歧视、暴力行动和战争的宣传。
    为了拯救我们的孩子，让我们用一切力量来恢复并巩固国际和平！
    要求各国政府制止在朝鲜、越南和马来亚所进行的招致儿童死亡的战争。
    要求联合国裁减军备委员会削减无限制膨胀的军事预算，而把这种款项用来满足儿童的需要。声讨大批屠杀儿童的滔天罪行，要求禁止原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器等大批屠杀人类的武器。
    要求全世界各国签署禁止细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
    维护殖民地人民为挣脱束缚他们、迫使他们牺牲自己孩子的枷锁而斗争的权利。
    全世界的人民，让我们加强我们兄弟般的合作来拯救儿童吧！
    在全世界各国成立全国保卫儿童委员会，增设各地方的保卫儿童委员会。
    每一个城市、工厂和村庄，必须在六月一日——国际保卫儿童节——举行强大的示威，拥护和平、拥护世界各国人民的互相信赖和信任。
