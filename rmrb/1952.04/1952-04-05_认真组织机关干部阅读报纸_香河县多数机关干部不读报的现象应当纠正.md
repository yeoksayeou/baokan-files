    Seriously Organize 机关干部 Reading Newspapers
    The Phenomenon of Most 机关干部 in Xianghe County Not Reading Newspapers Should Be Corrected

    To the Editor: The situation of cadres in various agencies in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, especially those engaged in economic work, neglecting to read newspapers is very serious. They do not have a regular habit or system of reading newspapers, and reading newspapers is done on a voluntary basis. Whoever wants to read reads, and whoever doesn't want to read doesn't read. Therefore, only a few people read newspapers regularly. The Xianghe County branch of the People's Bank of China has a total of twenty-four cadres, most of whom are young students who have just graduated from school. In terms of education level, there is no difficulty in reading newspapers; however, except for the director, the secretary, and one salesperson who regularly read newspapers, the others basically do not read newspapers. Among the more than sixty cadres of the county cooperative, except for a few cadres in the office and organizational guidance section who pay more attention to reading newspapers, other cadres rarely read newspapers or do not read them at all. Some people read newspapers to find "interest" and to "adjust their minds when work is boring." Only one-tenth of the cadres in the Finance Section regularly read newspapers. In agencies such as the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, the Taxation Bureau, and the Grain Company, only a few people regularly read newspapers. Because cadres do not pay attention to reading newspapers, their understanding of some major political issues is very vague, or they do not know them at all. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have been carried out vigorously throughout the country for several months, but even now some cadres cannot fully understand their significance. Many people in the county post office only know that they should oppose corruption and bribery, but they have not realized the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's organized and planned frenzied attack on us. Many people in the Taxation Bureau and the People's Bank of China do not know what the "Star Four Dinner Party" is all about; some people do not know about the US imperialism spreading bacteria in Northeast China, Qingdao, and the "Kee Kev Incident" in Wuhan.

    Why don't these cadres pay attention to reading newspapers? Some comrades in the Finance Section of the county cooperative said: "We write numbers in the books from morning till night, as long as the accounts are correct, it won't cause any big trouble if we don't read the newspapers." Some people in the Taxation Bureau and the Post Office also believe that "work is busy enough, where can we find time to study newspapers." There are quite a few people with this point of view. This is mainly because they do not care about politics, and they do not understand that if economic workers are divorced from politics, they will fall into the quagmire of routineism. Of course, this phenomenon is also inseparable from the fact that the leading comrades neglect the political and current affairs education of the cadres. Because these agencies do not have enough cultural and educational expenses, they subscribe to very few newspapers. The leading comrades of these agencies have not promptly tried to solve this problem. I hope that the leading comrades of these agencies will pay attention to organizing the cadres in the agencies to study newspapers. Ren Gengming

    认真组织机关干部阅读报纸
    香河县多数机关干部不读报的现象应当纠正
    编辑同志：河北省香河县各机关的干部，特别是做经济工作的干部，忽视读报的情况很严重。他们没有经常读报的习惯和制度，看报是自流的。谁爱看就看，不想看就不看。因此，只有少数人经常看报。人民银行香河县支行共有二十四个干部，大都是刚从学校出来的青年学生，就文化程度来说，看报纸是没有什么困难的；但是该行除了行长、秘书和一个业务员经常看报以外，其他的人基本上都不看报。县合作社六十多个干部中，除了办公室和组导科的少数干部还比较注意看报外，其他干部就很少看报或根本不看。有些人看报是为了找“兴趣”，为了“在工作烦闷时，调剂一下脑筋”。财政科只有十分之一的人经常看报。花纱布公司、税务局、粮食公司等机关中，经常看报的人也都是少数。因为干部不注意阅读报纸，所以他们对于一些重大的政治问题就了解得十分模糊，或者根本不知道。“三反”“五反”运动在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展几个月，但至今还有些干部不能全面地领会它的意义。县邮局不少人只知道应该反对贪污、反对行贿，但是却没有认识到资产阶级有组织有计划地向我们猖狂进攻的严重性。税务局、人民银行不少人不知道“星四聚餐会”是怎么回事；有些人对美帝国主义在我国东北、青岛撒布细菌和武汉市发生的“纪凯夫事件”都不知道。
    为什么这些干部不注意阅读报纸呢？县合作社财务科有的同志说：“我们从早到晚是在账簿上写数字，只要把账算对就可以了，不看报出不了大乱子。”税务局和邮局也有人认为“工作够闹的了，那里还顾上学习报纸。”有这种观点的人为数不少。这主要是因为他们不关心政治，他们不了解经济工作者如果脱离了政治，就会使自己陷于事务主义的泥坑。当然，这种现象和领导同志忽视干部的政治时事教育也是分不开的。这些机关因为文教费用不够，订的报纸份数很少。这个问题，各机关领导方面并没有及时设法解决。我希望这些机关的领导同志注意组织机关中的干部学习报纸。  任更明
