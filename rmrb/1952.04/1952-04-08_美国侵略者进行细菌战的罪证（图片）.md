Evidence of Bacteriological Warfare by American Aggressors
Photo Caption:
    Top right: On March 12th, at a little past 12 o'clock, American aggressor aircraft intruded into the airspace above Dongmen area of Kuandian County, China, and scattered bacteria-carrying insects. These are the fragments and spindle of an American bacteria bomb found in the area.
    Top left: Grinding the bacteria-carrying fleas scattered by the American aggressors into an emulsion, 0.5 cc was injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig. After the injection, the guinea pig's body temperature rose, its weight decreased sharply, and it died on the eighth day. This is a smear of the dead guinea pig's spleen, showing many Rickettsia under a microscope.
    Bottom right: The bacteria-carrying chicken feathers scattered by the American aggressors were placed in a mortar and washed with sterile saline. The washing solution was injected into the abdominal cavity of a white mouse. The white mouse died after twenty-four hours. This is a smear of the dead mouse's liver examined under a microscope, revealing anthrax bacilli with capsules and square ends. The black rectangular bodies in the picture are anthrax bacilli.

    图片说明
    上右：美国侵略军飞机于三月十二日十二点多钟，侵入我国宽甸县东门一带上空撒布带菌毒虫。这是在该地发现的美国细菌炸弹的弹片及弹轴。
    上左：将美国侵略者撒下的带菌跳虫，磨碎作成乳剂，取零点五西西注射入豚鼠皮下，注射后豚鼠体温升高，体重锐减，于第八日死亡。这是死亡豚鼠脾脏作成的涂片，在显微镜下看出含有许多立克次氏体。
    下右：把美国侵略者撒布的带菌鸡毛置于乳钵内，用无菌的生理盐水捣洗，将捣洗液注射于小白鼠的腹腔内，二十四小时后，小白鼠死亡。这是死鼠肝脏作涂抹标本镜检，发现带有荚膜两端方形的炭疽杆菌，图中黑色长方形体为炭疽杆菌。
