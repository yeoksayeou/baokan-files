    Anyang Special District People's Hospital, Pingyuan Province
    Should Examine and Correct Irresponsible and Unhygienic Mistakes
    Editor: Some staff members of the Anyang Special District People's Hospital in Pingyuan Province have serious shortcomings in their work. They often allow patients with infectious diseases to live with general patients. They ignore patients' opinions when they raise them. Once, Yang Tiecheng, a patient suffering from arthritis, did not want to live with a patient suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and he asked the director to adjust the ward. The director not only did not accept his opinion, but said:
    "If you raise any more opinions, I will have to make an example of you." The head nurse, Du Jinshan, also said: "If you are afraid of being infected, then leave the hospital."
    The bedding used by patients in the hospital is never disinfected, not even sunned once; when a new patient arrives, it is taken out and used as is. Patients' food buckets are often used to fetch water and wash chamber pots and sputum cups, and they are often placed in the same place as the toilets. Anyone with a little knowledge of hygiene will know that this is extremely unhygienic, but the staff of this hospital are so muddle-headed, is this excusable? I think the Anyang Special District People's Hospital must carefully examine its work in order to correct these many mistakes in a timely manner.

### 平原省安阳专区人民医院  应检查纠正不负责任不讲卫生的错误

    平原省安阳专区人民医院
    应检查纠正不负责任不讲卫生的错误
    编辑同志：平原省安阳专区人民医院的某些工作人员在工作中有严重缺点。他们常常让害传染病的病人和一般的病人住在一起。病人向他们提意见，他们也不管。有一次，害关节炎的病人杨铁城，不愿和一个患肺结核病的病人住在一起，他向院长要求调整病室。院长不但不接受他的意见，反而说：
    “你再提意见，就非整你一下不可。”护士长杜金山也说：“怕传染你出院。”
    病人在医院用过的被褥从来是不消毒的，连晒也不晒一次；新病人来了，就原封拿出来用。病人的饭桶常常用来打水，洗便桶痰盂，并且常常和便器放在一个地方。稍懂卫生常识的人都会知道这是极不卫生的，但该医院工作人员却这般糊涂，这是能够宽恕的吗？我觉得安阳专区人民医院必须详细检查自己的工作，以期及时纠正这许多错误。
