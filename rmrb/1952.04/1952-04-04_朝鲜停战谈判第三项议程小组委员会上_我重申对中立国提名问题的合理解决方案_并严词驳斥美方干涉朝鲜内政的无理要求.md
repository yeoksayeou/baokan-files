Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. At the meeting of the Third Item Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 3rd, our side's representative reiterated our reasonable solution to the neutral nations nomination issue: both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all neutral nations nominated by the other side to form a neutral nations supervisory committee, or both sides each nominate three neutral nations without any consent procedures. Regarding the so-called issue of restricting airport equipment within Korea, which the other side raised again at the subcommittee meeting, our side's representative sternly pointed out: Any demand that interferes with our internal affairs is absolutely unacceptable to our side. Both sides have already agreed that no reinforcements of military forces, including combat aircraft, may enter Korea from outside Korea during the armistice. If the other side, like our side, strictly adheres to this agreement, it is impossible to imagine that there will be any increase in military forces, including air force strength, during the armistice. As for whether or not any equipment is built within Korea, it falls entirely within the scope of internal affairs, and neither side has the right to interfere. Our side's representative suggested that the other side withdraw this demand that interferes with our internal affairs and accept our reasonable plan to resolve the entire third item agenda, so that the meeting can make progress.
    At the Fourth Item Agenda staff meeting, at the suggestion of the other side, the meeting was adjourned for one day on April 3rd.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    我重申对中立国提名问题的合理解决方案
    并严词驳斥美方干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求
    【新华社开城三日电】三日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方代表再次声明我方在中立国提名问题上的合理解决方案，双方同时并一次同意另一方所提出的全部中立国提名，组成中立国监察委员会，或是双方各自提名三个中立国家，而不进行任何同意手续。对于对方在小组委员会上再次提出的所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的问题，我方代表严词指出：任何干涉我方内政的要求是我方所绝对不能接受的。双方既已同意停战期间不得自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内。如果对方和我方一样将严格遵守这一协议，就不可能设想停战期间会有任何军事力量的增加，包括空军力量的增加在内。至于朝鲜境内任何设备的修建与否，则完全属于内政范围，任何一方都无权过问。我方代表建议对方撤回这一干涉我方内政的要求，接受我方解决全部第三项议程的合理方案，以使会议能有所进展。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，在对方建议下，四月三日休会一天。
