    Nuns Learn Farming Skills
    In Nantshi, Qinghe Town, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu Province, there is a nunnery with four nuns. Before liberation, they never participated in labor production. After liberation, because fewer people "performed Buddhist rituals," their lives gradually became difficult. The four nuns discussed ways to make a living. Finally, they decided to farm. They cultivated four mu of land in Xiudan Township, about five or six li away from the nunnery. They worked hard to learn the skills of plowing, harrowing, weeding, and planting vegetables. Now they have mastered these skills. Sometimes, they also do odd jobs for others. The income from their labor is enough to support their own lives. The head nun no longer allows a twenty-year-old nun to shave her head and even sent her to Nanqinghe Elementary School to study. This year, on "March 8th" Women's Day, the nuns participated in the commemoration meeting. This is a new phenomenon in the new society! Wang Shiyuan

    尼姑学会了耕田种地的本领
    苏北启东县清河镇南市有个尼姑庵，里面住着四个尼姑。解放前，她们一向不参加劳动生产。解放后，由于“做佛事”的人少了，她们的生活渐渐发生了困难。四个尼姑便商量求生的办法。最后决定种田。她们在庵外五、六里路的秀旦乡种了四亩田。她们辛勤地学习耕田、耙地、锄草、种菜的本领。现在，这些技能她们都学会了。有时，她们还去替人家做做短工。她们劳动所得的收入，完全能够维持自己的生活了。当家的老尼姑，不再让一个二十岁的尼姑剃发了，并且还送她到南清河小学校去读书。今年“三八”妇女节，尼姑们都参加了纪念会。这是新社会里的新现象！  王士元
