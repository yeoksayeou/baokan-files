    Wanping Fujiatai Farmers Actively Scrape Trees to Prevent Insects
    In order to prevent and control insect pests in fruit trees, the farmers of Fujiatai, Wanping County, Hebei Province, launched a tree scraping (removing the outer layer of old bark) insect prevention campaign. In three days, they scraped the old bark off 7,629 jujube and apricot trees, which will be very helpful for preventing insect pests this year. Their actions of responding to the government's call for patriotic production increase and actively scraping trees to remove eggs and prevent insects are worthy of emulation by farmers in various regions.

    宛平傅家台农民积极刮树防虫
    河北省宛平县傅家台农民，为了防治果树的虫害，展开了刮树皮（刮去树的外层老皮）防虫运动。他们在三天内就刮去了七千六百二十九棵枣、杏树的老皮，这对今年防治虫害很有作用。他们这种响应政府爱国丰产号召，积极刮树除卵防虫的行动，是值得各地农民学习的。
