The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee held its 76th administrative meeting on April 5. The main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the handling of the serious violations of law and discipline, and the crimes of harming the country and the people, committed by the major thief He Hengfu, who was exposed and reported during the "Five-Anti" movement. The meeting invited representatives from democratic parties in Wuhan and Hubei Province, as well as representatives from Wuhan's industrial and commercial sectors, to attend.

The meeting began with a report by Wei Jinfei, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee, on the criminal facts of He Hengfu's major theft group, which was exposed by shop assistants and employees during the "Five-Anti" movement; and conveyed the demand of all employees in the international trade industry that the People's Government severely punish this major thief.

The report on the criminal facts of He Hengfu's major theft group caused shock and anger among all attendees. Minister of Water Resources Liu Fei, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Chen Mingshu, Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office Nie Guoqing, Deputy Director Peng Yihu, Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs Li Minghao, Vice-Chairman Zhang Nanxian, Secretary-General Zhang Zhiyi, Minister of Justice Huang Qixiang, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee Li Yiqing, Minister of Transportation He Guiyan, and others spoke successively, unanimously stating that the major thief He Hengfu should be immediately removed from all positions in the People's Government, arrested, and severely punished according to the law. Vice-Chairman Zhang Nanxian said: "He Hengfu trafficked drugs, endangering the people, and the quantity was extremely alarming. This crime alone is more than enough for him to deserve death." Minister Liu Fei said: "He Hengfu wore the cloak of a democratic person, but engaged in such shocking activities. His crimes have far exceeded the 'five poisons.' The losses he caused to the Chinese people cannot be estimated by figures of several hundred billion or several trillion yuan." Minister Chen Mingshu said: "He Hengfu is not only full of the five poisons, but also an evil demon who betrays the people, endangers the country, and poisons the nation. Such a heinous major thief who attacks the Chinese people deserves to die ten thousand times." Minister Huang Qixiang and Deputy Director Nie Guoqing both said: "He Hengfu's case shows that he is no longer an ordinary profiteer, a common thief, or a smuggler, but a major criminal who seriously endangers the country and the people." Deputy Director Li Yiqing said: "For more than two years, he participated in our meetings on major financial and economic issues. The political and economic losses suffered by the country as a result cannot be estimated in numbers. I demand that this vermin of the people be severely punished." Minister He Guiyan said: "The exposure of He Hengfu's theft group is a great victory in our Five-Anti movement. This victory, in addition to the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, should first be attributed to the broad masses of workers and staff." Secretary-General Zhang Zhiyi said: "The People's Government has been extremely benevolent and righteous to He Hengfu. It is unreasonable to be lenient to such a person, and it cannot convince the people and cadres, nor can it educate the industrial and commercial sectors themselves. Therefore, I also advocate severe punishment. I also hope that those in the industrial and commercial sectors who have not thoroughly confessed can learn from this and quickly explain their problems, and not follow He Hengfu's path."

Chen Jingyu, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, reported at the meeting that he had talked with He Hengfu six or seven times on behalf of the mayor, urging him to confess and repent. The People's Government has been benevolent and righteous to him to the utmost extent, but he insisted on his mistakes and refused to admit his guilt. Deputy Mayor Chen said: "He Hengfu's criminal behavior is not only unconscionable, but also inhuman. The large amount of drugs he trafficked has killed countless compatriots in our country! He is not only the enemy of the industrial and commercial sectors, but also the enemy of the people of the whole country. I believe that in addition to arresting him and punishing him severely according to the law, all the property he stole from the country must be recovered."

The speeches of representatives from various democratic parties reflected the demands and opinions of all parties. Geng Bozhao, one of the heads of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "It is not enough to appease the people's anger if people like He Hengfu are not severely punished." Shi Fangbai, head of the Hubei Province of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said: "The masses are extremely resentful of He Hengfu's crimes and unanimously demand that the People's Government punish him severely." Ma Zhemin, Director of the Wuhan Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "We must not only severely punish He Hengfu, but also make the people fully aware of the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's attack on the state and the people through this case. We must resolutely repel this attack and fundamentally eliminate the poison of this crime."

The speeches of Hua Yuqing, Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, Secretary-General Wu Chuanqi, and member Yu Jintang, listed facts to show that He Hengfu has consistently undermined and resisted the policies and decrees of the People's Government, disrupted mass movements, and spread a large number of reactionary remarks for more than two years. Hua Yuqing said: "The poison that He Hengfu spread in the industrial and commercial sectors is extremely deep and huge. We must gradually and thoroughly eliminate his reactionary influence. We also suggest that the People's Government severely punish this major thief to educate the people of the whole country, especially the industrial and commercial sectors in Wuhan."

At this point, Vice-Chairman Deng Zihui made a concluding instruction. He said: "He Hengfu, as a member of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, has committed such a great crime. He blatantly and massively stole national economic intelligence, and used the methods of 'sending in' and 'pulling over' to usurp the leadership of many national economic organs, massively stole state property, and even more unconscionably smuggled and trafficked gold and drugs, poisoning the people. These crimes are intolerable. At the beginning of the case, the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Wuhan Workers' Representatives had proposed to remove He Hengfu from all positions in the People's Government and arrest him and bring him to justice. In order to handle the matter carefully and to hope that He Hengfu could thoroughly confess and repent, we actively investigated the case and patiently persuaded him. We hoped that he could turn over a new leaf and strive for lenient treatment. In addition to Deputy Mayor Chen Jingyu's several dissuasions on behalf of the mayor, Secretary-General Zhang Zhiyi also personally explained the great righteousness and the advantages and disadvantages on my behalf. However, He Hengfu was extremely cunning, refused to confess, and insisted on resisting our rescue of him, and has reached an incurable point. Although this major theft case has not been completely closed today, the case has been clarified, and its nature is extremely serious. If it is not handled seriously, it is not enough to enforce the law of the country and appease the anger of the people. The speeches in everyone's discussion are good. We must immediately remove him from all positions in the People's Government and immediately arrest him and bring him to justice. We have submitted this decision to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval in advance. After the case is finally clarified, we will punish him according to law."

The meeting endorsed the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, removed He Hengfu from all positions in the People's Government, and immediately arrested him and brought him to justice.

Vice-Chairman Deng Zihui continued to point out in his conclusion the lessons that should be learned from this case. He said: "The exposure and reporting of He Hengfu and the illegal merchant group he led and commanded once again proves the seriousness of the rampant attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie on the Communist Party, the working class, and the People's Government. This is an ironclad and indisputable fact, not an exaggeration or alarmist talk; it also proves once again that the attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie are organized and planned, and are carried out from all aspects of economy, politics, organization, and ideology. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, carry forward the victories we have already won, and completely smash the rampant attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie to achieve complete and thorough victory in the 'Five-Anti' struggle."

Vice-Chairman Deng Zihui pointed out: "The end of He Hengfu should be a warning to the industrial and commercial sectors in particular. Don't follow He Hengfu's path. Whoever takes this path will surely end up like He Hengfu, disgraced and ruined. The People's Government's policy towards the national bourgeoisie has not changed in any way, and the Common Program has not been revised by a single word. Today, it is still New Democracy, and the national bourgeoisie is still one of the four major friends; however, we must never want friends like He Hengfu. The People's Government will still resolutely protect industrialists and businessmen who abide by the law, act in accordance with the Common Program, engage in legitimate business, and obey the leadership of the state and state-owned economy, and guarantee their normal profits. Because the Chinese people need such private enterprises today, and its existence and development are in line with the current interests of the Chinese people. In the future, the industrial and commercial sectors must improve management, establish new business ethics, and truly achieve high quality, low price, and genuine goods at fair prices, and obtain legitimate profits from accelerating capital turnover and small profits but quick turnover. Don't ever think about making a fortune from one or two transactions. At the same time, industrialists and businessmen must also rely on workers and shop assistants, accept the leadership and supervision of the working class, and implement genuine labor-management benefits, so as to actively improve operations and develop production. Now, nearly 30,000 industrial and commercial households in Wuhan have made conclusions separately, and they should be encouraged to actively resume business and develop production, especially to support spring plowing production and the Jingjiang flood diversion project, and strive to restore material exchanges between urban and rural areas and prosperity of economic life. National banks and trade departments should also adhere to and quickly resume business, and provide necessary and possible support to legitimate industrialists and businessmen.

"From the exposure and reporting of He Hengfu's major theft group, we should also see again the great truth of relying on the working class. He Hengfu's major theft group was huge in scale, and its organization was undoubtedly strict; in his own words, he was a member of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee in the open, and he spanned both the 'Qing' and 'Hong' gangs in the dark. For several years, he directed this group of profiteers to steal state property unscrupulously and engage in smuggling and drug trafficking. However, thanks to the full mobilization of employees, it was finally exposed. This once again specifically and vividly tells us: all our work must follow the mass line. Today, the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements must mobilize the masses; tomorrow, when we carry out production and construction, we must mobilize the masses even more. In the 'Three-Anti' movement, many cadres have fallen, but this is only one aspect. We must see the more important aspect, which is the growth of new forces. The 'Three-Anti' movement is a good purgative, washing away some bad residues, while at the same time growing and developing healthy muscles. The experience of revolutionary work in the past proves that cadres do not come from training classes, but are tested, cultivated, and tempered in revolutionary movements. Let those degenerate and corrupt elements fall, and let those new forces grow rapidly! On the one hand, we must streamline institutions, and on the other hand, we must boldly, across levels, and exceptionally promote activists who have been tested in the movement to new leadership positions. In the past, we did not fully mobilize shop assistants and workers. This 'Five-Anti' movement has greatly improved their class consciousness and organizational level. This is an extremely great gain for us and an inexhaustible source of cadres. In short, all our work must rely on the masses, especially the working class, and all work is also for mobilizing the masses and mobilizing the workers. Mobilizing the masses is the basic means of revolution from the perspective of current tasks, and it is our basic purpose in all movements from the perspective of the long-term tasks of revolution. In order to achieve the complete victory of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, we must fully recognize the purpose of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, continue to deeply mobilize the masses, and continue to discover and cultivate a large number of new forces from the movement, and continuously replenish our cadre ranks, and prepare for and participate in our great construction undertakings that will be launched on a large scale."

The Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, in accordance with the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the resolution of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, arrested He Hengfu at 3:00 p.m. on April 6.

    大盗窃犯贺衡夫已被逮捕归案
    中南军政委员会行政会议上大家一致拥护政务院命令
    邓子恢副主席号召接受教训争取五反斗争的彻底胜利
    中南军政委员会在四月五日举行了第七十六次行政会议。这次会议，主要是讨论处理在“五反”运动中被揭发检举出来的大盗窃犯贺衡夫的严重违法乱纪和祸国殃民的罪行的问题。这次会议，邀请了武汉市、湖北省的民主党派人士以及武汉市工商界人士列席参加。
    会议首先由武汉反贪污联合检查委员会副主任魏今非报告在“五反”运动中被店员、职工检举揭发出来的贺衡夫的大盗窃集团的罪恶事实；并转达了国际贸易业全体职工希望人民政府予这个大盗窃犯以严厉惩处的要求。
    关于贺衡夫的大盗窃集团罪恶事实的报告，引起全体与会人员的震惊和愤怒。水利部刘斐部长、农林部陈铭枢部长、参事室聂国青副主任、彭一湖副主任、民政部李明灏副部长、张难先副主席、张执一秘书长、司法部黄琪翔部长、财政经济委员会李一清副主任、交通部贺贵严部长等相继发言，一致表示应当立即撤销大盗窃犯贺衡夫在人民政府的所有职务，逮捕法办，并予以严厉的惩处。张难先副主席说：“贺衡夫贩卖毒品，危害人民，数量之大，极为惊人。仅仅这个罪恶，已是死有余辜了。”刘斐部长说：“贺衡夫披着民主人士的外衣，却进行着这样骇人听闻的勾当。他的罪行，已经大大地超出了‘五毒’之外。他所给予中国人民的损失，也不是几千亿或几万亿元的数字所能估计的。”陈铭枢部长说：“贺衡夫不仅是五毒俱全，而且是个叛卖人民、危害国家、毒害民族的万恶的魔鬼。这样一个穷凶极恶向中国人民进攻的大盗窃犯，万死也不足辞其咎。”黄琪翔部长和聂国青副主任都说：“贺衡夫的案件说明，他已经不是一个普通的奸商，一个通常的盗窃犯和走私犯，而是一个严重危害国家人民的重大罪犯。”李一清副主任说：“二年多来，我们有关财经问题重大措施的会议，他都参加了，国家因此在政治上经济上所受的损失，是不能用数字估计的，我要求将这个人民的蟊贼予以严厉惩办。”贺贵严部长说：“贺衡夫盗窃集团的被揭露，是我们在五反运动中的一个伟大胜利。这个胜利的取得，除了共产党和人民政府的领导以外，应首先归功于广大职工。”张执一秘书长说：“人民政府对贺衡夫已是做到仁至义尽了。对这样的人再宽大，就毫无道理，就不能说服人民与干部，也不能教育工商界本身。因此，我也主张予以严厉的惩办。并且希望还没有彻底坦白的工商界人士能以此为鉴，迅速交代自己的问题，不要再走贺衡夫的道路。”
    武汉市人民政府陈经畬副市长在会上报告，他曾代表市长和贺衡夫恳谈过六七次，劝导他坦白悔过，人民政府之对他仁至义尽，已到了无以复加的地步，但是他却坚持错误不肯认罪。陈副市长说：“贺衡夫的犯罪行为，不仅伤天害理，而且毫无人性，他所贩运的大量毒品，不知杀害了我国多少同胞！他不仅是工商界的敌人，而且是全国人民的敌人。我认为，除了逮捕法办、予以严惩外，必须将他盗窃国家的财产，全部追回。”
    各民主党派人士发言，反映了各方面的要求和意见。中国国民党革命委员会湖北省分部负责人之一耿伯钊说：“像贺衡夫这样的人，不严加惩办实不足以平民愤。”农工民主党湖北省负责人施方白说：“群众对于贺衡夫的罪恶，是极度愤恨的，一致要求人民政府从严惩办。”民主同盟武汉市支部主任委员马哲民说：“我们不仅要严厉惩办贺衡夫，而且必须从这个案件使人民充分认识到资产阶级向国家人民进攻的严重性。我们必须坚决打退这种进攻，并从根本上肃清这种罪行的流毒。”
    武汉市工商业联合会筹委会代主任委员华煜卿、秘书长吴传启和委员余金堂的发言，列举事实，说明贺衡夫两年多来一贯破坏和抵抗人民政府的政策、法令，破坏群众运动，并散布大量的反动言论。华煜卿说：“贺衡夫在工商界中散布的毒素，是至深且巨的，我们一定要逐步和彻底地肃清他的反动影响。我们也建议人民政府严厉惩办这个大盗窃犯，以教育全国人民，特别是教育武汉市工商界。”
    至此，邓子恢副主席作结论指示。他说：“贺衡夫身为中南军政委员会委员，却犯下了这样大的罪恶。他明目张胆地、大量地盗窃国家经济情报，用‘派进来’‘拉过去’的办法篡夺许多国家经济机关的领导权，大量的盗窃国家财产，而且更伤天害理地大量地走私贩卖黄金毒品，毒害人民。这些罪行都是不能容忍的。在案情暴露之初，武汉市工商联和武汉市职工代表即曾提出撤销贺衡夫在人民政府中一切职务并将其逮捕法办的要求，我们为了慎重处理，并希望贺衡夫能够彻底坦白悔过，一方面积极考察案情，一方面耐心进行劝导。希望他能够翻然改悔，争取从宽处理。除了陈经畬副市长代表市长的几次规劝，张执一秘书长还代表我亲自晓以大义晓以利害。但是贺衡夫狡猾绝顶，拒不坦白，坚持抵抗我们对他的挽救，已经到了不可救药的地步。今天这个大盗窃案虽未完全结案，但案情已经大白，性质极端严重，如不严肃处理，不足以申国法而平民愤。大家在讨论中的发言都是好的，我们必须立即撤销他在人民政府中的一切职务，并立即予以逮捕法办，这种处理我们已事先呈请中央人民政府政务院批准，待案情最后查清后，再依法治以应得之罪。”
    会议拥护中央人民政府政务院的命令，撤销贺衡夫在人民政府的一切职务，并立即予以逮捕法办。
    邓子恢副主席在结论中继续指出从这个案件中应该汲取的教训。他说：“贺衡夫及其所领导、指挥的奸商集团的被揭发检举，再一次证明了不法的资产阶级向共产党、工人阶级和人民政府猖狂进攻的严重性，这是铁证如山、无可置辩的事实，并不是夸大其词或危言耸听；也再一次证明了不法的资产阶级的进攻是有组织有计划的，是从经济、政治、组织和思想等各方面来进行的。我们必须百倍地提高警惕，在已有的胜利基础上，再接再厉，彻底打垮不法的资产阶级的猖狂进攻，取得‘五反’斗争的全部的、彻底的胜利。”
    邓子恢副主席指出：“贺衡夫的下场，工商界特别要引为殷鉴。大家不要再走贺衡夫的道路。谁要走这条道路，谁就一定要像贺衡夫一样的身败名裂。人民政府对于民族资产阶级的政策并没有任何改变，共同纲领也没有修改一字，今天还是新民主主义，民族资产阶级还是四大朋友之一；但是，我们决不能要贺衡夫那样的朋友。守法的、依照共同纲领办事的、进行正当经营、服从国家和国营经济领导的工商业者，人民政府仍然坚决予以保护，并保证其正常利润。因为中国人民今天需要这样的私营企业，它的存在和发展符合于中国人民当前的利益。今后工商界要改善经营管理，树立新的商业道德，真正做到物美价廉、货真价实，从加速资金周转和薄利多销中去取得正当的利润，决不要再想做一两笔生意就可以发横财。同时，工商业者还必须依靠工人、店员，接受工人阶级的领导和监督，实行真正的劳资两利，借以积极改善经营、发展生产。现在武汉市有将近三万工商户已经分别作出了结论，应当鼓励他们积极恢复业务和发展生产，特别是支持春耕生产和荆江分洪工程，努力恢复城乡内外物资交流，繁荣经济生活。国家银行、贸易部门也应坚持和迅速恢复业务，并予正当工商业者以必要和可能的支持。
    “从贺衡夫大盗窃集团的被揭发检举，我们也应当再次看出依靠工人阶级这个伟大的真理。贺衡夫大盗窃集团，规模庞大，组织不可谓不严密；用他自己的话来说，明的他是中南军政委员会委员，暗的他跨着‘青’‘洪’两帮。几年来他指挥这个奸商集团肆无忌惮地盗窃国家财产，进行走私贩毒。但是由于充分发动了职工，终于被揭发出来。这又一次具体生动地告诉我们：我们的一切工作，必须走群众路线。今天‘三反’和‘五反’运动，要发动群众；明天进行生产建设，更是要发动群众。在‘三反’运动中，许多干部垮下来了，但这只是一方面。我们必须看到更为重要的另一方面，这就是新生力量的成长。‘三反’运动，正是一付良好的清泻剂，把一些坏的残渣清洗出去了，同时即生长和发展着健康的肌体。历来革命工作的经验证明：干部不是从训练班里出来的，而是从革命运动中考验培养锻炼出来的。让那些堕落腐化的分子倒下去吧，让那些新生的力量迅速成长起来吧！我们一方面要精简机构，一方面要大胆地、越级地、破格地提拔在运动中经过考验的积极分子到新的、领导者的岗位上去。过去，我们没有把店员和工人充分地发动起来，这次‘五反’运动中极大的提高了他们的阶级觉悟和组织程度，这是我们一个极其伟大的收获，也是我们取之不尽用之不竭的干部源泉。总之，我们的一切工作都要依靠群众，特别是依靠工人阶级，而且，一切工作也都是为了发动群众发动工人。发动群众，从当前的任务看是革命的基本手段，而从革命的长远任务看，则是我们在一切运动中的基本目的。为了取得‘三反’和‘五反’运动的彻底胜利，我们必须完全认清‘三反’、‘五反’的目的性，必须继续深入地发动群众，并从运动中继续发现和培养大批新生力量，源源地充实我们的干部队伍，准备和参加我们即将大规模展开的伟大建设事业。”
    最高人民法院中南分院遵照中央人民政府政务院命令和中南军政委员会决议，已于四月六日下午三时把贺衡夫逮捕归案。
