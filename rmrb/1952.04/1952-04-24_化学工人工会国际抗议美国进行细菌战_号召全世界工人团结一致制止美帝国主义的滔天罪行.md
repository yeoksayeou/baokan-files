Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Chemical Workers' Union has received a "Letter to Chemical Workers of the World" from the Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International. In this document, the Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International strongly protests against the US imperialists' germ warfare, calls on workers worldwide to unite in protest, and demands that germ warfare be stopped. The full text of the "Letter to Chemical Workers of the World" is as follows:

The American aggressors have once again committed heinous crimes.

The US military command in Korea has used bacteriological weapons against the Korean people. American planes have dropped large numbers of insects carrying plague and cholera germs over the front lines and behind the lines of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

After using Korean and Chinese prisoners of war for bacteriological weapons experiments, the US military command has now used bacteriological weapons to massacre the army and peaceful residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on a large scale.

The 1925 Geneva Protocol stipulates the prohibition of the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons in combat. The American representative also signed this protocol, but the American aggressors are now violating this protocol.

Because the US military command has failed to achieve any victory in the war of aggression against the Korean people, it has committed a crime even more heinous than that of the notorious Hitler gang.

The new crimes of the American aggressors are unprecedented. These crimes are intended to murder the entire freedom-loving humanity and threaten the lives and safety of all ordinary people.

Therefore, no one should be indifferent to the strong calls to protest the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons.

The Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International, representing more than two million members, lodges a strong protest:

Against the US military command's conduct of germ warfare in Korea.

Against the US military command's blatant and outrageous violation of the Geneva Protocol and international law in wartime.

The Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International makes the following demands to the United Nations:

Demand immediate and effective measures to stop the crimes of the American aggressors.

Demand immediate and severe punishment for those who organize the use of bacteriological weapons.

Demand intervention to stop the Korean War and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

The Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International calls on all workers and all trade unions and workers' organizations around the world, regardless of political views or religious beliefs, trade union membership, nationality, ethnicity, and other boundaries, to unite in the protest of the Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International and to unite together to fight against the danger posed by the American imperialist war instigators to all mankind.

Strongly protest against the US military command's use of bacteriological weapons!

Demand that your government and the United Nations immediately take effective measures to stop the crimes of the American aggressors!

Demand immediate and severe punishment for those who organize the use of bacteriological weapons!

Unite as one to defend peace and defend progress!

Chairman of the Chemical Workers' Trade Unions International: Gidi (signed)

    号召全世界工人团结一致制止美帝国主义的滔天罪行

    美国侵略者再一次犯下了滔天罪行。
    在朝鲜的美军司令部已对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器。美国飞机已在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的前线和后方投下大量带有鼠疫菌、霍乱菌的昆虫。
    美军司令部继用朝鲜和中国战俘作细菌武器的试验之后，已经使用细菌武器来大规模地屠杀朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军队与和平居民。
    一九二五年的日内瓦议定书规定禁止使用毒气和细菌武器作战，美国代表也曾在这项议定书上签字，可是美国侵略者现在却破坏了这个议定书。
    美军司令部由于在侵略朝鲜人民的战争中未能获得任何胜利，竟犯下了比尽人皆知的希特勒匪帮的罪行还要灭绝人性的罪行。
    美国侵略者新的罪行是史无前例的，这种罪行是要谋害整个爱好自由的人类，并且威胁着所有普通人的生命和安全。
    因此任何人对于抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的强有力的呼声都不应采取漠不关心的态度。
    化学工人工会国际代表二百万以上的会员，提出强烈的抗议：
    反对美军司令部在朝鲜进行细菌战。
    反对美军司令部在战争中明目张胆地、令人愤慨地破坏日内瓦议定书和国际公法。
    化学工人工会国际向联合国提出要求如下：
    要求立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵略者的罪行。
    要求立即严惩组织使用细菌武器者。
    要求出面干涉，制止朝鲜战争，并要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。
    化学工人工会国际号召全世界所有的工人及一切工会和工人组织，不分政治见解或宗教信仰，工会会籍、国籍、种族等界限，一致参加化学工人工会国际的抗议，并团结在一起，为反对美帝国主义战争煽动者威胁全人类的危险而进行斗争。
    强烈地抗议美军司令部使用细菌武器！
    要求你们本国政府和联合国立即采取有效措施制止美国侵略者的罪行！
    要求立即严惩组织使用细菌武器者！
    团结成一个人，保卫和平，保卫进步！
