    Welcome the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe

    Welcome the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe to Beijing! More than one hundred Hungarian artists have come to Beijing, and this is the first time in history! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
    How far apart are China and Hungary, and how different are the Chinese and Hungarian languages, but what does it matter? We are all liberated people, and we speak the same language in our thoughts! In art, we each have our own national style, but in the theory of art, we speak the same language. Your art and our art both express the life of the people and serve the people.
    I don't understand Hungarian, but I understand the songs, dances, and music performed by the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe. Not only do I understand them, but I was deeply moved! From those beautiful songs, dances, and music, I saw a part of the Hungarian people's life and culture, a lovely life and culture! Those songs, dances, and music were so simple and joyful that I saw the smiling faces of the Hungarian people and heard their laughter. I love those male and female actors, and I also love the people they represent. After the performance, I already knew that the Hungarian people are healthy, happy, and have a high level of cultural accomplishment. Even if I never have the opportunity to go to Hungary, I will always respect and love the Hungarian people.
    The programs performed by the People's Art Troupe all have a strong national style. Precisely because of this, they are very lovely. Precisely because of this, we feel close and interested. Precisely because of this, we can better understand that only liberated people have the right to create art and can make their own art flourish. The art of the people's democratic countries is the beautiful flower of the people's wisdom. The art of capitalist countries is manufactured according to order forms, because art is also a commodity. Our art is created by the people themselves, and it expresses the life and ideals of the people, thus enabling the people to enjoy artistic life. Welcome the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe! Let us always move forward hand in hand, and in the inseparable relationship between politics and art, enthusiastically promote the superiority of our political system, enthusiastically develop our people's art, teach art to cooperate with political tasks, and create our ever-changing happiness!

    欢迎匈牙利国家人民文工团
    老舍
    欢迎匈牙利国家人民文工团光临北京！一百多位匈牙利的文艺工作者来到北京，在历史上这还是头一次！欢迎！欢迎！欢迎！
    中国和匈牙利相隔有多么远啊，中国话和匈牙利话多么不同啊，可是那有什么关系呢？我们都是解放了的人民，我们在思想上说着同一样的言语！在艺术上，我们虽各有各的民族风格，可是在艺术的理论上我们又说着同一的语言。你们的和我们的艺术都是表现人民生活的，都是为人民服务的。
    我不懂匈牙利话，我可是懂了匈牙利国家人民文工团表演的歌舞和音乐。岂止是懂了呢，我受了很大的感动！从那些优美的歌舞和音乐中，我看到了匈牙利人民一部分的生活和文化，可爱的生活和文化！那些歌舞和音乐是那么纯朴欢快，教我看到匈牙利人民的笑脸，听到他们的笑声。我爱那些男女演员们，也爱他们所表现和代表的人民。表演完毕，我已经认识了匈牙利人民是健康的快活的，有很高的文化修养的。即使我永远没机会到匈牙利去，我也会永远敬爱匈牙利的人民。
    人民文工团表演的节目，都带着浓厚的民族风格。正因为这样，它们才非常可爱。正因为这样，我们才感到亲切有味。正因为这样，我们才更能了解：只有解放了的人民才有艺术创作权，才能使自己的艺术发扬光大。人民民主国家的艺术是人民智慧的美丽花朵。资本主义国家的艺术是照着定货单子制造的，因为艺术品也是商品。我们的艺术是由人民自己创造的，它表现了人民的生活和理想，从而使人民享受艺术生活。欢迎匈牙利国家人民文工团！让我们永远携着手前进，在政治和艺术分不开的关系中，热情地发扬我们的政治制度的优越性，热情地发展我们的人民艺术，教艺术配合着政治任务，创造我们日新月异的幸福！
