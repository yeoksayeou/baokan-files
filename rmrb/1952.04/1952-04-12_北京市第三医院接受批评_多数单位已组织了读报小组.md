Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Beijing No. 3 Hospital Accepts Criticism
    Most Units Have Organized Newspaper Reading Groups

    To the Editor: The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on March 22 pointed out the shortcoming of our hospital staff neglecting reading the newspaper. We believe this criticism is very correct. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the administrative leadership has not recognized that newspapers are an important weapon for guiding practical work and improving the political and ideological level of cadres. Although the hospital subscribed to many newspapers in the past, we did not pay attention to urging everyone to read and study the newspapers, let alone establishing a regular newspaper reading system. Therefore, as criticized in the newspaper, many people lack a proper understanding of major political issues at home and abroad.

    In order to thoroughly correct the phenomenon of medical workers neglecting political and current affairs study, we have decided to increase newspaper subscriptions in departments with fewer copies; and we plan to hold current affairs quizzes regularly in the future to further strengthen political and current affairs education for medical workers. After the newspaper's criticism, most units in the hospital have now organized newspaper reading groups and have established a certain system for reading and studying newspapers. The tendency of nurses not paying attention to politics is changing. For example, the head nurse of the surgical ward now personally leads the nurses in her unit in reading the newspaper every day. However, a small number of departments still do not pay enough attention to the criticism in the newspaper and have not changed the situation of not reading the newspaper. We are trying to organize them as well, so that all staff in the hospital can engage in regular newspaper reading and study.

    In addition, the People's Daily reader mentioned in the criticism that almost everyone in our hospital was unaware of the "Girkevich Incident." After further investigation, we found that this situation is prevalent among nurses; general doctors pay more attention to newspaper study and are aware of these major political events.

### 北京市第三医院接受批评  多数单位已组织了读报小组

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市第三医院接受批评
    多数单位已组织了读报小组
    编辑同志：三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏指出我院工作人员忽视读报的缺点，我们认为这个批评是很正确的。造成这种现象的原因，主要是行政领导方面没有认识到报纸是指导实际工作、提高干部政治思想水平的重要武器。以前医院里虽然也订了不少报纸，但是我们却没有注意督促大家进行读报学习，更没有建立经常的读报制度。因此，正如报上所批评的，很多人对于国内外重大的政治问题缺乏应有的认识。
    为了彻底纠正医务工作者忽视政治时事学习的现象，我们已决定在报纸份数较少的部门，增订报纸；并且计划在今后经常举行时事测验，以便进一步加强对医务工作者的政治时事教育。经过报纸的批评，现在全院已有多数单位组织了读报小组，并且订出了一定的读报学习制度。护士中的不问政治的倾向正在改变，如外科病房护士长现在亲自领导本单位的护士，每天读报纸。但是，仍有少数部门对报纸上的批评重视不够，还没有把不看报的情况改变过来。我们正在设法把他们也组织起来，使全院工作人员都进行经常的读报学习。
    此外，人民日报读者在批评中，提到我院几乎所有人都不知道“纪凯夫事件”。经我们进一步了解，这种情况在护士中是普遍存在的；一般的医生还比较重视报纸学习，并且知道这些重大的政治事件。北京市第三医院院部
