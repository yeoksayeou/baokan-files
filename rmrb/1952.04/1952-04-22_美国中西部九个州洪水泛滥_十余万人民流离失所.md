Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: According to TASS, another flood has occurred in nine Midwestern states in the United States. In the past week, the flood has submerged 1.25 million acres of land, displacing over 100,000 people.

    The flood initially occurred in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and has now spread to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri, especially along the Missouri River and the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. In the flooded city of Blenco, Iowa, more than 500,000 bushels of corn have rotted in stores, a fact that sufficiently indicates the extent of property damage.

    General Pick, captain of the Army Corps of Engineers, reported that in the Missouri region, 50 cities have been flooded, 87,000 people are homeless, 27 sections of railways in the Missouri Basin are blocked, and parts of 83 highways are submerged (according to later estimates by the Red Cross, approximately 114,000 people have been displaced).

    The "National Guardian Weekly" pointed out that the current flood in the Missouri Basin is "the tenth flood in ten consecutive years." Behind this recurring tragedy lies the worst and longest-standing scandal of malfeasance in the country.

    The "Daily Worker" wrote: "The floods encountered by the Midwestern provinces are man-made. The money the government spends on a heinous and useless atomic bomb or on two massive battleships could build flood control projects for the Missouri River basin, supply cheap electricity, and save human lives. Last week, Truman allocated another billion dollars for the construction of atomic factories. But he refused all requests to control the floods in the Mississippi River and Missouri Basin... The Congress, which only knows how to carry out political persecution, endlessly approves billions of dollars for those merchants of death, for arming fascists around the world, and for building more than 500 air bases on continents around the world. Truman is asking for $7 billion to 'aid' the Nazis in West Germany, the fascist Franco, and the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, but he only offers $500,000 for flood relief—about five dollars for each victim! The American people, made homeless by the floods, are paying a tragic price for the government's 'state of emergency' hoax, which concentrates and spends America's wealth on useless and destructive armaments instead of on useful peaceful construction."

    美国中西部九个州洪水泛滥
    十余万人民流离失所
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国中西部九个州又闹水灾，在过去一星期内洪水已淹没了一百二十五万英亩的土地，使十万多人流离失所。
    这次水灾首先发生在蒙大拿、北达科他和南达科他三州，现在已蔓延到明尼苏达、威斯康星、内布拉斯加、衣阿华、堪萨斯和密苏里各州，特别是沿密苏里河和密士失必河上游一带。在衣阿华州被淹没的布兰科市，有五十多万蒲式耳的玉蜀黍烂在商店里，这一件事实已足以表明财产损失的程度了。
    陆军工程队队长匹克将军报告说：在密苏里区域，被淹没的城市有五十座；八万七千人无家可归；在密苏里盆地有二十七处的铁道被阻断，八十三条大路的各部分被水淹（据后来红十字会估计，约有十一万四千人流离失所）。
    “国民前卫周刊”指出：目前密苏里盆地的洪水是“连续十年泛滥的第十次”。在这个重复不已的悲剧的后面便是全国最坏的和最悠久的舞弊丑闻。
    “工人日报”写道：“中西部各省所遭遇的水灾是人为的。政府在一颗可恶而无用的原子弹上面或是在两只庞大的战舰上面所耗费的金钱，就可以建立对密苏里河流域的洪水的管制工程，供给廉价的电力并拯救人类的生命。上一星期杜鲁门又拨款十亿美元作为建造原子工厂的用途。但是他却拒绝了关于抑制密士失必河和密苏里盆地的洪水的一切要求……。只知道进行政治迫害的国会，为那些制造死亡的商人，为武装全世界的法西斯分子，并为在世界各洲建筑五百多处空军基地，却毫无止境地通过亿兆美元的拨款。杜鲁门要求七十亿美元去‘援助’西德的纳粹分子、法西斯的佛朗哥和匪首蒋介石，但是他只拿出五十万美元来作水灾救济金——每一个受难者大约可得五块钱！被水灾弄得无家可归的美国人民正为政府的‘紧急状态’的骗术付出悲惨的代价，这种骗术把美国的财富都集中耗费在毫无裨益的毁灭性的军备上面，而不用在有用的和平建设上面。”
