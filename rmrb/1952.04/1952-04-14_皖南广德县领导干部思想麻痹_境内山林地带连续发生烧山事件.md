Leading Cadres in Guangde County, Southern Anhui, Are Ideologically Paralyzed; Mountain Fires Occur Continuously in Mountainous Areas

To the Editor: In the mountainous areas of Guangde County, Southern Anhui, starting from March 31st, arson incidents have occurred continuously in twenty villages across five districts (two, three, five, six, and eight), causing extremely severe damage to the mountain forests. Taking Maolin Village in the sixth district as an example, over 12,000 mu of mountain forest and over 2.4 million saplings have been destroyed. The events unfolded as follows: On April 1st, Zhang Xueliang, a farmer from Yanghe Village, started a forest fire while burning paper during tomb sweeping, resulting in the burning of over 7,000 mu of mountain forest and over 1.4 million saplings in Maolin Village. Fu Guangdi (a member of the Communist Youth League), a farmer from the same village, had previously set fire to the mountains to clear land for tobacco planting. After everyone extinguished the fire he set and advised him against it, he ignored the villagers' advice and set fire to the mountains again. This time, the fire was very large, destroying over 5,000 mu of mountain forest and over 1 million saplings. In addition, Wang Chengcai, the director of the village farmers' association, burned over 100 mu of mountain forest and over 20,000 saplings by lighting a fire to smoke. We believe that the main reason for this incident is the ideological paralysis of the county and district leading cadres. They have neither conducted in-depth publicity and education among farmers regarding forest protection work, nor have they given attention to the leadership of forest protection organizations, thus causing huge losses to the country. We suggest that the relevant departments not only give the perpetrators of forest destruction (who have been arrested) the punishment and education they deserve, but also give appropriate punishment to the derelict cadres.

    皖南广德县领导干部思想麻痹
    境内山林地带连续发生烧山事件
    编辑同志：皖南广德县山林地带，自三月三十一日起，二、三、五、六、八等五个区二十个村，连续发生纵火烧山事件，山林损失极为严重。以六区茆林村为例，就烧毁山林一万二千多亩，树苗二百四十余万株。事件发生的经过是这样：四月一日，洋河村的农民张学良，因上坟烧纸，引起林火，共烧了茆林村的山林七千多亩，树苗一百四十余万株。同村农民傅光弟（青年团员），为了开荒种烟，曾经放火烧山。大家扑灭了他放的山火，并且规劝了他。他不听村民的劝告，再度放火烧山，这次火势很大，共烧毁山林五千多亩，树苗一百多万株。此外，该村农会主任王成材，因点火吸烟，烧毁山林一百多亩，树苗二万多株。我们认为，造成这一事件的原因，主要是这个县的县区领导干部思想麻痹。他们既没有向农民进行深入的关于护林工作的宣传教育，又忽视对护林组织的领导，因而给国家造成巨大的损失。我们建议有关部门除给破坏山林者（已拘捕）以应得的惩处和教育外，并予失职的干部以适当的处分。
