    **Demanding the People's Government to Severely Punish Big Traitorous Merchants Like He Hengfu and Zhou Wuyi**
    —**Reader Letters Summary**

The crimes of big traitorous merchants like He Hengfu and Zhou Wuyi in Wuhan, who endangered the country and the people, have aroused boundless anger among the people of the whole country. Many readers of this newspaper have written continuously, demanding severe punishment for these heinous merchants.

    Yue Yun, a reader from the suburbs of Beijing, wrote: "The peasants calculate the stolen money of embezzlers and thieves in terms of corn. One million yuan can buy 1,500 jin of corn, which is the annual harvest of ten mu of medium-yield land, enough for a family of three to eat for a year. He Hengfu stole hundreds of billions of yuan of state property. This money could feed hundreds of thousands of households (families of three) for a year, equivalent to the annual harvest of millions of mu of medium-yield land. If the big thief He Hengfu is not severely punished according to the law, how can the anger of the peasant brothers be appeased?" Jiao Yingtang from the Construction Department of Renmin University wrote: "Under the rampant attack of the big traitorous merchant He Hengfu, it is unknown how much state property was stolen. How many healthy people have been harmed by the narcotics sold by He! He Hengfu not only engaged in counter-revolutionary work economically but also instigated a political 'strike,' which is absolutely intolerable." Wang Jiuduo and Sun Erxi from the Zhengzhou Department Store Committee of the China Shop Employees' Union wrote: "He Hengfu smuggled a large amount of gold abroad, sending the blood and sweat of the Chinese people to the enemy. This is simply recognizing a thief as a father and being an accomplice of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits." Sun Binghua from the Tangshan Kailuan Public Security Department wrote: "From He Hengfu's crimes, we can see how insidious and rampant this big traitorous merchant, who pretended to be progressive and infiltrated the government, was!" Jiang Xingtu, Zhu Feng, Yuan Peiqing, and Xie Chunjie from the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Company wrote: "The fact that the big traitorous merchant He Hengfu stole state property proves once again, indisputably, that the attack of illegal capitalists on the working class is organized and planned."

    Cai Binglin from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "In October and November last year, our unit entrusted the private Wuhan Sawmill in Hankou to process a batch of wood. Under the direction of Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan, the factory skimped on materials in large quantities. This year, when our unit sent people to Hankou to investigate the processing of this wood, Zhou Wuyi prevaricated in every possible way, refused to admit his mistakes, and slandered the government, saying: 'The position of the public is different from our position, there is no way to reason.' The exposure of this arson case further demonstrates the reactionary essence of Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan." Wei Lan from the Xijiao Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau wrote: "What a shameful face: 'He made money in the fire!' Zhou Wuyi fraudulently obtained more than 260 million yuan in compensation from the insurance company; burned Li Guiying's child to death; framed Wang Fenglian, causing him to be imprisoned for four months; tortured worker Liao Jinzhang to death—this is a blood debt that should be repaid!" Chen Shaoshang from the People's Court of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wrote: "We absolutely cannot tolerate the heinous crimes of the big traitorous merchant Zhou Wuyi and others." Shi Ren and others, teachers from the Jilin Provincial Workers and Peasants Quick Literacy Middle School, wrote: "On the day of the arson, the big traitorous merchant Zhou Wuyi even took his mistress out for a leisurely stroll, which is extremely infuriating."

    In their letters, readers unanimously demanded that the government swiftly and severely punish He Hengfu, Zhou Wuyi, and other utterly wicked and shameless big traitorous merchants who "made money in the fire" according to the law!

    **Cadres Leading the Changyuan River Channel Project in Qixian County, Shanxi Province**
    **Abandoned Leadership, Resulting in the Death of Migrant Workers**
    
    Editor: When cadres of the Water Conservancy Section of the Qixian County People's Government in Shanxi Province led the Changyuan River channel repair project, they neglected the specific leadership of the migrant workers opening the channel. On April 8, a tragic incident occurred in which earth collapsed, killing three migrant workers. The course of events was as follows: The migrant workers from Dahan Village at the Changyuan River channel repair site used the method of digging holes in the canal wall to transport earth in order to save labor. The possibility of the hole collapsing was very high, so this method was very dangerous. When the migrant workers from Dahan Village used this method, they had already smashed a handcart. However, such a serious problem did not attract the attention of the leading cadres responsible for this work. On April 8, when the migrant workers from Qiaojiabao used this method to transport earth, approximately two rooms of earth collapsed, killing three migrant workers.

    There are often three to four thousand workers working at the Changyuan River channel repair site, but sometimes there is not even a county or district cadre in command. This is one of the main reasons for the above incident. I believe that in addition to the cadres of the Qixian County Water Conservancy Section responsible for this work thoroughly examining their work, the cadres leading the channel opening work in various places should all learn from this lesson.

    **All Localities Should Pay Attention to Preventing and Controlling Wheat Aphids**

    Editor: Since late March, wheat aphids and red spiders have successively occurred in Henan, Shaanxi, Pingyuan, Shanxi, northern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu, harming wheat seedlings. In Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, there were eighty aphids on every inch of wheat leaves; in Chengguan District, Mengjin County, Henan Province, there were few aphids on April 4, but by April 6, they were flying all over the sky; in Xichuan County, red spiders occurred in 171 townships, and some wheat had already withered. In order to help various localities prevent and control aphids, I would like to introduce the methods I know for preventing and controlling aphids.

    There are two types of wheat aphids: (1) Short-horned aphids: winter-born aphids are dark green, summer-born aphids are light green, their feet and abdominal horns are black, their bodies are slender, their heads are darker than their bodies, their eyes are red, and their antennae are shorter than their bodies. Winged aphids are dark green and shiny, their heads are olive black, their eyes are dark red, and their antennae are black. Their hosts are wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, and gramineous weeds. (2) Long-horned aphids: their bodies are green, with dark reddish-brown markings, their bodies are long and elliptical, and near the tail of their backs there is a pair of blackish-brown cylindrical horn-like protrusions. There is a protruding tail piece at the end of their abdomen, and their antennae are slender. Winged aphids have transparent wings. Their hosts are wheat, rice, sugarcane, and gramineous weeds. Both of these wheat aphids are smaller than cotton aphids and do not harm cotton.

    Prevention and control methods: (1) Wheat aphids and red spiders reproduce very quickly, so they must be universally controlled, continuously controlled, and thoroughly controlled. (2) Because wheat aphids occur over a wide area, a lot of medicine is needed, which may be too late to handle or uneconomical. Therefore, manual capture must be the main method. (3) In 1950, Pingyuan Province used the mulberry fork method to control red spiders. This year, Henan Province used this method to control wheat aphids, and both have achieved results and can be adopted (use a winnowing basket tied to a three-pronged fork used for threshing, move it along the wheat seedlings, the faster the better. Pingyuan Province mobilized 692 people in two days, beating 1,825 mu of land and catching 451 jin of insects). This method cannot be applied when the height of the wheat seedlings is close to one foot. (4) When the wheat seedlings have not yet jointed, you can use a mat dipped in water, with the back side up; one person pulls the rope and runs forward, causing the insects to fall on the mat, gather them, and burn them.

    (5) The tobacco water, tobacco lime water, cotton oil soap, and flour paste water commonly used in various places can all be used; flour paste water can be used on wheat seedlings where both wheat aphids and red spiders occur. (6) When necessary, spray 0.5% "666" powder in key areas. (7) In areas that produce soap pods, you can use one liang of finely ground soap pod powder and two liang of water, mix them into a thin paste, wait for ten minutes, slowly add five liang of vegetable oil (cotton oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, etc.), mix thoroughly, and then slowly add 60 jin of water, stir thoroughly, prepare and use immediately, and spray on wheat aphids (this kind of liquid medicine should not be left for too long). (8) Break two to three eggs, mix them evenly, slowly add three liang of vegetable oil, stir thoroughly until no oil spots are visible, then slowly add 37 jin of water, stir thoroughly, and spray on wheat aphids, also prepare and use immediately. This method has recently been used in Shanxi and has been effective. (9) Use a broom to sweep the wheat aphids and red spiders into a winnowing basket or basin. This method must be carried out continuously for several days. (10) Red spiders climb onto wheat seedlings to harm them from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and this pattern must be grasped when preventing and controlling them.

    **Problems That Need to Be Solved Urgently in the Afforestation Movement**

    Editor: Based on the afforestation situation in various parts of Shanxi Province and the experience and lessons of the past two years, I feel that in order to promote the afforestation movement, the following problems must be solved: (1) Some people say: "Trees are planted every year, but no trees are seen." In the past two years, many trees have been planted along the highways, and some villages have also mobilized the entire village to plant trees collectively, but some trees have disappeared, and some have died. The reasons for this situation are roughly threefold: 1. They only call for afforestation, but do not pay attention to protection; most of the trees are eaten to death by sheep or pulled away by pedestrians. People reflect: "Planting trees without protecting them is equivalent to not planting trees." Therefore, paying attention to the protection of trees is a very important thing. 2. The masses know very little about the great significance of "afforestation can transform nature"; many people do not yet understand the policy of "whoever plants it owns it"; some villages have collectively planted trees, but no stock certificates have been issued for the trees planted. Some people think that this is planting trees for the government, so they do things perfunctorily, so that many trees are planted, but few survive. I think educating the peasants about the great significance of afforestation for farmland water conservancy is the key to mobilizing the masses to actively plant trees. 3. When mobilizing the masses to plant trees, they did not pay attention to the specific conditions at that time and place, and pay attention to scientific technologies such as deep planting, solid tamping, less exposure, and dense planting. Some people could not even distinguish the shady and sunny sides, and some people did not pay attention to whether the soil in the place where the trees were planted was suitable for the growth of trees, and whether the terrain was suitable for the survival of trees, which all affected the survival rate of seedlings. (2) There is a lack of seedlings. The solution is, in addition to cultivating a large number of seedlings, to organize compensated transfer, or exchange through relatives and friends; use more cuttings and layering methods, and less cutting planting methods; and appropriately transplant some wild seedlings. (3) In the past two years, trees have been planted on barren mountains, some have not sprouted, and some have sprouted, but they have died due to natural disasters, which has affected the confidence of the masses in greening the whole territory. The way to overcome this is to pay attention to the technology and conditions of sowing, and at the same time, use broad-leaved tree species that are suitable for the local conditions. In highlands, wild coniferous seedlings should be transplanted. (4) Greenification tasks must be completed in an organized manner and on time. We must rely on the organized peasants, based on production mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, and with labor models as the backbone, to carry out large-scale afforestation. Schools, government agencies, organizations, and troops at all levels should work hard to publicize and play a leading and exemplary role. In addition, we must mobilize the vast number of individual farmers to actively plant trees.
    Wang Quanmao, Director of the Forestry Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government

    要求人民政府严惩危害国家的大奸商贺衡夫周武彝等
    ——读者来信综述
    武汉市大奸商贺衡夫、周武彝等危害国家人民的罪行，激起了全国人民无比的愤怒。本报许多读者连续来信，要求严惩这些罪大恶极的奸商。
    北京市郊读者岳云来信说：“农民们对贪污分子、盗窃分子的赃款，是按玉米来计算的。一百万元可买一千五百斤玉米，这是十亩中等地的全年收获量，可够三口之家吃一年。贺衡夫盗窃国家财产数千亿元，这笔钱可供数十万户（三口之家）吃一年，等于数百万亩中等地的全年收获量。如不依法严惩大盗窃犯贺衡夫，农民弟兄们的愤怒，何能平息？”中国人民大学修建处焦英棠来信说：“在大奸商贺衡夫猖狂进攻之下，国家财产不知被盗窃了多少。多少健康的人民，受到了贺犯贩卖的毒品的损害。贺衡夫不但在经济上进行反革命工作，而且策动了政治性的‘罢市’，这是绝对不能容许的。”中国店员工会郑州市百货业委员会王九多、孙尔席来信说：“贺衡夫偷运大批黄金出口，把中国人民的血汗送给敌人，这简直是认贼作父，是美蒋匪帮的帮凶。”唐山开滦公安处孙炳华来信说：“从贺衡夫的罪行中，我们可以看出这个假装进步、混入政府的大奸商，是如何的阴险，如何的猖狂！”平原省粮食公司蒋兴图、朱枫、袁培庆、谢春绩来信说：“大奸商贺衡夫盗窃国家财产的事实，再一次无可置辩地证明了违法资本家对工人阶级的进攻，是有组织的、有计划的。”
    人民解放军某部蔡秉霖来信说：“我部去年十月、十一月间，委托汉口私营武汉锯木厂加工一批木料，该厂在周武彝、郭嵩山主持下，大量偷工减料。今年，我部派人前往汉口调查此项木料加工情况时，周武彝百般狡辩，拒不承认错误，并诬蔑政府说：‘公家的立场和我们的立场不同，没法讲道理。’这一次纵火案的被揭露，更充分说明周武彝、郭嵩山的反动本质。”北京市西郊公安分局蔚蓝来信说：“这是多么可耻的嘴脸：‘他在火灾中赚了钱！’周武彝诈取了保险公司两亿六千多万元的赔款；烧死了李桂英的小孩；诬陷王凤莲，使他坐牢四个月；折磨死工人廖金章；——这是血债，应该讨还！”内蒙古自治区人民法院陈绍商来信说：“大奸商周武彝等令人发指的滔天罪行，我们绝对不能容忍。”吉林省工农速成中学校教员石人等来信说：“大奸商周武彝在纵火的当天，还带着姘妇悠闲地逛街，实在令人愤恨已极。”
    读者们在来信中，一致要求政府迅速依法严惩贺衡夫和周武彝等“在火灾中赚了钱”的万恶无耻的大奸商！
    山西祁县领导昌源河渠工的干部
    放弃领导酿成砸死民工事件
    编辑同志：山西祁县人民政府水利科干部领导昌源河修渠工程时，忽视对开渠民工的具体领导，在四月八日，发生土方下陷、砸死三名民工的惨痛事件。事情发生的经过是这样的：昌源河修渠工地的大韩村民工，为了运土省工，采用了在渠壁挖洞运土的方法。洞土下陷的可能性很大，因此，这种作法是十分危险的。大韩村民工使用这一方法时，就曾砸坏一辆手推车。但是这样一个严重的问题，并没有引起负责这一工作的领导干部的重视。四月八日，乔家堡民工使用这一办法运土时，就有约两间房大小的土方下陷，砸死三名民工。
    昌源河修渠工地经常有三、四千工人工作，但是，有时竟没有一个县、区干部指挥。这是发生上述事件的主要原因之一。我认为除了祁县水利科负责这一工作的干部应深刻检查自己的工作外，各地领导开渠工作的干部，都应该记取这一教训。

    各地应注意防治麦蚜虫
    编辑同志：三月下旬以来，河南、陕西、平原、山西、皖北、苏南等地先后发生麦蚜、红蜘蛛，为害麦苗。平原省辉县每寸麦叶上有蚜虫八十个；河南省孟津县城关区四月四日蚜虫尚少，六日就满天飞了；淅川县一百七十一个乡发生红蜘蛛，有些麦子已经枯死。为了帮助各地防治蚜虫，我愿把所知道的防治蚜虫的方法介绍出来。
    麦蚜有两种：（一）短须蚜：冬生的暗绿色，夏生的淡绿色，足和腹角都是黑色，体形细长，头较体黑，眼红色，触须较体短。有翅的，体色暗绿光亮，头为橄榄黑色，眼深红色，触须黑色。它的寄主是小麦、大麦、玉米、高粱、黍粟、甘蔗和禾本科杂草。（二）长须蚜，体绿色，带暗红褐色，体为长椭圆形腹背近尾部有一对黑褐色圆柱形的角状突出物，腹部末端有一突起的尾片，触须细长。有翅的，翅透明。它的寄主是麦、稻、甘蔗和禾本科杂草。这两种麦蚜都较棉蚜为小，而且都不为害棉花。
    防治方法：（一）麦蚜、红蜘蛛繁殖很快，必须普遍治、连续治、彻底治。（二）因为麦蚜发生面积广大，用药很多，一时赶办不及，可能也不经济，必须以人工捕捉为主。（三）一九五零年平原省用桑杈法防治红蜘蛛，今年河南省用此法防治麦蚜，都收到效果，可以采用（用簸箕绑在打场用的三股杈上，顺着麦苗动，愈快愈好。平原省曾在两天内动员六百九十二人，打了一千八百二十五亩地，捕虫四百五十一斤）。这种方法，在麦苗高度接近一尺时就不能应用了。（四）麦苗没有拔节时，可用席沾水，背面向上；一人拉绳前跑，使虫落在席上，聚集焚毁。
    （五）各地惯用的烟草水、烟草石灰水、棉油皂、面糊水等，都可采用；在麦蚜和红蜘蛛都发生的麦苗上，可用烟草面糊水。（六）必要时有重点的喷撒千分之五的“六六六”药粉。（七）在出产皂荚地区，可用研细的皂荚粉一两和水二两，调成稀糊，等候十分钟，慢慢地加植物油（棉油、豆油、花生油、菜油等都可）五两，充分调匀，再慢慢地加水六十斤，充分搅拌，随制随用，喷射麦蚜（这种药水不可久搁）。（八）用鸡蛋二到三个打碎调匀，慢慢地加植物油三两，充分搅拌，以不见油点为止，再慢慢地加水三十七斤，充分搅拌，即可喷射麦蚜，也须随制随用。此法最近在山西使用，已见成效。（九）用扫帚把麦蚜、红蜘蛛扫落在簸箕或盆里。此法必须连日不断地进行。（十）红蜘蛛在下午四时到七时爬到麦苗上为害，防治时，必须掌握这一规律。
                            张而耕植树造林运动中急需解决
    的问题
    编辑同志：根据山西省各地植树造林的情况和二年来的经验教训，我觉得为了推进造林运动，必须解决下列问题：（一）有些群众说：“常年植树不见树”，两年来，公路两旁曾植了不少树，有些村庄也曾发动全村群众集体植树，但有一部分树已不见了，一部分已经死了。造成这种情况的原因，大致有三方面：1、只号召植树造林，却不注意保护；大部分树被羊啃死或被行路人拔走了。群众反映：“植树不保护，等于不植树。”所以，注意保护林木是很重要的事情。2、群众很少知道“造林能改造大自然”的重大意义；不少群众还不明白“谁栽归谁”的政策；有些村庄曾经集体植树，但种了树却没有发股票。有些群众认为这是给政府栽树，因此，便应付差事，以致植的树很多，活的却很少。我觉得对于农民进行关于植树造林对农田水利的重大意义的教育，是发动群众积极造林的关键。3、发动群众植树时，没有根据当时当地的具体条件，讲究深栽、实捣、少露、密植等科学技术，有的人连阴阳面都分不清，有的人没有注意植树的地方的土壤是否适合树木成长，以及地形是否适宜树木生存等情况，都影响了树苗的成活率。（二）树苗缺乏。解决的办法，除了大量培育树苗外，应组织有代价的调剂，或通过亲朋互换；多用插条、压条法，少用插杆栽植法；并可适当移植一部分野生树苗。（三）两年来，在荒山种树，有些未出苗，有些出了苗，但因遭受自然灾害死了，以致影响了群众绿化全境的信心。克服的办法是注意播种的技术和条件，同时，采用适合当地乡土的阔叶树种。在高地则应移植野生针叶树苗。（四）必须有组织地按时完成绿化任务。要以生产互助组和生产合作社为基础，以劳动模范为骨干依靠组织起来的农民，进行大规模的植树造林，各级学校、机关、团体、军队应该努力宣传，并发挥带头和示范的作用。另外，对广大的单干农民，也要发动他们积极造林。
