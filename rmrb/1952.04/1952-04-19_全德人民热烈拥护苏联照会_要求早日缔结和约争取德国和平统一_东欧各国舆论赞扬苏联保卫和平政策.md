Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet Union's note of April 9 to the United States, Britain, and France on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany has greatly encouraged the entire German people who are struggling for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic have published commentaries for days in support of the Soviet note. The "Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party, commented on April 13: "In its new note, the Soviet Union once again pointed out to the German people the path towards a unified, democratic Germany. This note gives the fullest support and assistance to the German people's struggle for a peace treaty with Germany. The question now is: We must immediately take advantage of the opportunities given to us; we must now do everything possible to reach an agreement between Germans and an agreement between the four powers."

The "Morgenpost," the organ of the Free Democratic Party, commented on April 16: "The German people demand that the Western countries give a clear and unequivocal answer to the Soviet Union's recent clear proposals. They demand that the representatives of the four countries meet to reach an agreement on the issue of all-German elections and the conclusion of a peace treaty with the whole of Germany."

In West Germany, the "Freies Volk," the central organ of the German Communist Party, published an editorial in support of the Soviet note. The newspaper called on communists, social democrats, and trade union members to unanimously demand all-German elections and the establishment of a unified, democratic Germany. Most West German bourgeois newspapers carried detailed reports on the Soviet note on their front pages. Many newspapers have published continuous commentaries. The "Deutsche Union-Dienst" commented on the Soviet note: "Whoever does not want a third world war should agree to four-power negotiations."

The Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation issued a statement supporting the Soviet note and called on the entire German working class to fight for the unification of Germany. Participants in the All-German Folk Art and Amateur Art Conference held in Berlin also passed a declaration demanding that the major powers immediately begin negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany based on Soviet proposals.

Mass rallies are now being held in various parts of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. Regardless of their social status and party affiliation, participants in the rallies unanimously and warmly support the Soviet proposal for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in their speeches. Prominent West German miners' leader Agetz said at a meeting near Hamm: "The Soviet proposal meets the most ardent hopes of all the German people." Communist, social democratic, and non-party workers participating in a meeting held in Oestrode called on the German working class to unite and strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity. Former Bonn government Interior Minister Heinemann demanded the restoration of German unity at a discussion evening in Dortmund to avoid a third world war. He mentioned that many politicians in West Germany had unanimously believed that the Soviet Union never wanted war.

Public opinion in the Eastern European People's Democracies warmly supports the Soviet Union's second note of April 9 to the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

Polish newspapers have pointed out the great significance of the Soviet note for consolidating European peace. "Głos Pracy" said: "The Soviet note is a major event in the struggle to establish a unified, peace-loving Germany and consolidate European peace." "Życie Warszawy" pointed out: "In the struggle for German unification, two distinct policies have been clearly manifested: on the one hand, the Soviet Union's peaceful policy of defending European peace and easing international tensions, which reflects the Soviet Union's desire to solve the German question; on the other hand, the policy of the capitalist countries led by the United States, which seeks to obstruct German unification and make it easier for them to turn West Germany into a springboard for future aggression."

Czechoslovakia's "Lidová Fronta" said: "In order to maintain and strengthen peace, the Soviet Union has once again extended its hand to the Western countries. The Soviet proposal is supported by hundreds of millions of people around the world. The Soviet proposal is an expression of the consistent Soviet policy towards Germany and an expression of the Soviet Union's international peace and friendship policy." "Mladá Fronta" said: "The US imperialists often pay lip service to peace, but whenever there is a need to specifically discuss peace issues, they always evade these issues. The US note of March 25 shows that the US imperialists do not want German peace at all. However, the people of all countries are intensifying their struggle to defend peace and are solving problems themselves. In West Germany, more than nine million Germans have voted in favor of peace and unity. The entire peace-loving humanity is supporting the German people's struggle for a unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty."

The Romanian working people are enthusiastically discussing the Soviet note. The Bulgarian public believes that the Soviet note is another major contribution of the Soviet government to the cause of strengthening peace and building a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Academician Nadezhkov, Chairman of the Bulgarian National Peace Committee, said that the Soviet note once again proves the Soviet Union's peace policy.

    全德人民热烈拥护苏联照会
    要求早日缔结和约争取德国和平统一
    东欧各国舆论赞扬苏联保卫和平政策
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏联四月九日就缔结对德和约致美、英、法三国的照会，大大地鼓舞了正在为德国和平统一而斗争的全德国人民。
    德意志民主共和国报刊连日纷纷发表评论，拥护苏联照会。统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”四月十三日的评论说：苏联在它的新照会中再一次向德国人民指出走向统一、民主的德国的道路。这个照会对于德国人民争取对德和约的斗争给予了最充分的支持与援助。现在的问题是：必须立即利用给予我们的机会；现在必须尽一切努力在德国人之间取得协议，在四大国之间取得协议。
    自由民主党的机关报“晨报”在四月十六日的评论中说：“德国人民要求西方国家对苏联最近的明白的建议作出清楚与明确的答复。他们要求四国代表聚首一堂，就全德选举及与整个德国缔结和约问题取得协议。”
    在西德，德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民报”发表社论，拥护苏联照会。该报号召共产党人、社会民主党人和工会会员一致要求举行全德选举和成立统一的、民主的德国。大多数西德资产阶级报纸都在第一版上刊载了关于苏联照会的详尽报道。许多报纸都连续发表评论。“德意志联盟服务报”评论苏联照会说：“谁不希望第三次世界大战，谁就应该赞成四强谈判。”
    自由德国工会联合会中央理事会发表拥护苏联照会的声明，并号召德国全体工人阶级为德国的统一而斗争。在柏林举行的全德民间艺术与业余艺术会议的参加者也通过宣言，要求各大国根据苏联建议立刻开始关于对德和约的谈判。
    德意志民主共和国和西德各地现在都纷纷举行群众大会，参加大会的人不论他们的社会地位与党派关系如何，在发言中都一致热烈拥护苏联要求早日缔结对德和约的建议。西德著名矿工领袖阿盖茨在哈姆附近的一次大会上说：苏联建议是符合德国全体人民最殷切的希望的。参加在俄斯特罗得举行的会议的共产党、社会民主党和无党无派工人，吁请德国工人阶级团结一致，为争取缔结对德和约和恢复德国的统一而斗争。前波恩政府内政部长海纳曼在多特蒙德的一个讨论晚会上要求恢复德国的统
    一，以避免第三次世界大战。他提到西德的许多政治家都曾一致认为苏联永远不想战争。
    东欧人民民主国家舆论热烈拥护苏联在四月九日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国的第二个照会。
    波兰各报纷纷指出苏联照会对巩固欧洲和平的重大意义。“劳动之声报”说：苏联照会是争取建立
    一个统一的、爱好和平的德国以及巩固欧洲和平的斗争中的一件大事。“华沙生活报”指出：在争取德国统一的斗争中，两种截然不同的政策明确地表现出来了：一方面是苏联为了保卫欧洲和平与缓和国际紧张关系的和平政策，这个政策反映了苏联解决德国问题的愿望；另一方面是以美国为首的资本主义国家的政策，这个政策力图阻挠德国的统一，使它们更容易地把西德变成未来侵略的跳板。
    捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”说：苏联为了维护并加强和平，再度向西方国家伸出手来了。苏联的建议获得世界各地千百万人民的拥护。苏联的建议是始终一贯的苏联对德政策的一种表现，是苏联的国际和平与友好政策的一种表现。“青年阵线报”说：美帝国主义者常常空谈和平，但是每当需要具体讨论和平问题的时候，总是逃避这些问题。美国三月二十五日的照会表明，美帝国主义者们根本不要德国和平。然而，各国人民正在加紧为保卫和平而斗争，正在自己解决问题了。在西德，已有九百多万德国人投票赞成和平与统一。整个爱好和平的人类都在支持德国人民为统一德国、缔结和约而进行的斗争。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民热烈讨论苏联照会。保加利亚公众认为，苏联照会是苏联政府对加强和平以及建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的事业的另一重大贡献。保加利亚全国和平委员会主席、科学院院士那德热科夫说，苏联的照会再一次证明了苏联的和平政策。
