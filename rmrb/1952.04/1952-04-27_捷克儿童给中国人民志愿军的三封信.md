Editor's Note: Here are the translated versions of three letters written by Czech children to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The letters are filled with the Czech children's love for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the people of China and Korea. Each letter is written meticulously, and the letter paper is carefully decorated with drawings on the theme of defending peace in colored pencils. The photo shows the original letter written by the fourth-grade students of the Tenth National Elementary School in Prague.

(I)
Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
We, the children of Czechoslovakia, are now writing to you. We are watching daily your heroic assistance to the Korean people. You are helping them to resist the common enemy of all mankind—the American monopoly capitalist imperialists and their accomplices. We have complete confidence in your victory, because you are fighting for justice and the happy life of people all over the world.
We wish you all strength. All peace-loving people are looking up to you with confidence.
With best regards,
The entire student body of the Eleventh National School in Prague
(Prague 20th District, Czechoslovak Republic)

(II)
Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
We are watching with great concern the heroic struggle of the Korean people against the American aggressors. Our teachers have told us how the Americans attacked Korea without regard for good faith and how brutally they massacred the Korean people. We read the newspapers and listen to the radio and learned that the invading bandit troops are using inhumane bacteriological weapons.
They are also trying to endanger your country and provoke a new world war. We know that you are helping the Korean soldiers with great enthusiasm. In this way, you are defending peace and fighting for all mankind, including us children of Czechoslovakia. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and wish you complete victory. At that time, the Korean people will also live and build freely like the people of China and Czechoslovakia.
With best regards,
The entire student body of the Fourth Grade of the Tenth National School in Prague
(Strasnice District, Prague)

(III)
Unrecognized Dear Friends:
Every day we eagerly read the news from the Korean front. We are very happy to see your victories. We know that fighting against cunning enemies who use every means to harm you is not an easy task.
We wish you final victory in this war. From the beginning of this year, we have all volunteered to donate money to send to you, hoping that this will give you some help.
With best regards,
The entire student body of the Fifth Grade of the Tenth National School in Prague

    捷克儿童给中国人民志愿军的三封信
    编者按：这里是捷克儿童写给中国人民志愿军的三封信的译文。信内充满了捷克儿童对中国人民志愿军和中朝两国人民的热爱。每封信都写得十分工整，并且用彩色铅笔在信纸上细心地画了以保卫和平为主题的图画。照片就是布拉格第十国民小学四年级学生所写的信的原样。
    （一）
    中国人民志愿军同志们：
    我们捷克斯洛伐克儿童们现在写信给你们。我们每日注视着你们对朝鲜人民的英雄的帮助。你们帮助了他们反抗全人类共同的敌人——美国垄断资本帝国主义者及其帮凶们。我们对你们的胜利完全有信心，因为你们是为了正义和全世界人民的幸福生活而斗争着。
    我们祝你们有一切的力量。所有爱好和平的人们，都在充满着信心仰望着你们。
    此致    敬礼
    布拉格第十一国民学校全体学生
    （于捷克斯洛伐克共和国布拉格市第二十区）
    （二）
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：
    我们以非常的关心，注视着朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的英勇斗争。教师同志告诉我们：美国佬怎样不顾信义地袭击了朝鲜，怎样残暴地屠杀朝鲜人民。我们读报和听广播，知道了侵略匪军使用惨无人道的细菌武器。
    他们也企图危害你们的国家，并挑起一次新的世界大战。我们知道你们以高度的热诚在帮助朝鲜的战士们。这样，你们在保卫着和平，是为所有的人类，也包括着我们捷克斯洛伐克的儿童而作战。我们衷心地感谢你们，并祝你们全面的胜利。那时，朝鲜人民也将像中国和捷克斯洛伐克人民一样，自由地生活着和建设着。
    此致    敬礼
    布拉格第十国民学校第四年级全体学生
    （于布拉格市斯特拉斯尼采区）
    （三）
    不认识的亲爱的朋友们：
    每天我们以急切的心读朝鲜前线的消息。我们看到你们的胜利就非常高兴。我们知道对那些用尽了一切手段想要伤害你们的狡猾的敌人作战，不是一件容易的事。
    我们祝你们在这次战争中取得最后的胜利。从本年初开始，我们都已立下志愿，捐款捎给你们，希望这样能给你们一些帮助。
    此致    敬礼
    布拉格第十国民学校第五年级全体学生
