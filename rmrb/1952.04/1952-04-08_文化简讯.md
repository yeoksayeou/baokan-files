     ▲ The "Study" translation series has been changed to a monthly publication starting in 1952. The content will still focus on introducing important theoretical papers on Marxism-Leninism published in Soviet newspapers and periodicals. The second issue of 1952 has now been published. This issue contains translations of: "Summary of the Discussion on Logic Problems," "The Origin of the Earth and Planets," "Ethical Problems of the Marxist-Leninist Worldview," "Outline of a Textbook on Marxist-Leninist Ethics," and "On the Basic Characteristics of Socialist Realism" (all translated from the Soviet journals "Problems of Philosophy" and "Bolshevik").
