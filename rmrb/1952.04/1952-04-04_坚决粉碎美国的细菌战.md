    Resolutely Crush the American Bacteriological Warfare
    Liu Baiyu
    I have been to Korea, and I have personally witnessed the heinous crimes that the American fascist bandits have committed in Korea.
    I have seen every inch of Korean soil permeated with blood and hatred. I know that every Korean family can provide evidence in a court of justice. Yet, the American fascist bandits are now inhumanly spreading bacteria in Korea. Bacteria are the most brutal weapons of murder. An American professor named Winter once wildly proclaimed: "One gram of Bacillus botulinus can eliminate seven million people." The entire world has long condemned this most inhumane and barbaric act with justice. In 1925, forty-six countries signed the Geneva Protocol, "Prohibiting the Use of Asphyxiating, poisonous or Other Gases and of bacteriological Methods Of Warefare." In 1948, the United Nations also passed the "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide." We all know that Hitler's crimes in Europe were worse than a plague, but he still did not dare to use the plague bombs from the "Posin Institute." Now, Truman, Acheson, and Ridgway, these vampires, have completely lost their minds. They have stretched their blood-soaked hands toward Korea, and now, wave after wave of bacteria are being spread on our homeland.
    We love our motherland, which we have won with our blood. For the sake of our motherland, we fought from the south to the north, and from the north to the south. So many rivers, so many mountains, so many nights, and so many days, we fought on. Our heroic Chinese people finally shattered the darkness of the East created by imperialism, and we established a glorious, happy, peaceful, and free nation. On our homeland, many gratifying and lovely new things are happening every day.
    We cultivate the land deeply to increase grain production. We build our cities and villages to allow people to live a good life. In factories and mines, labor heroes are creating new records. Huge construction projects are appearing on the land one after another. The spring of 1952 will bring even more good news than in previous years. Look: more than a million laborers have already gone to the dikes to begin the second year of the Huai River harnessing project; Look: a thousand-mile-long windbreak forest has been started along the coast of northern Jiangsu, which will protect millions of farmers from the suffering of marine storms, floods, and droughts, and can also reduce the salinity in the air, improve the soil, and ensure good growth and harvest of crops. Our country is advancing every moment, and we are creating new miracles with our labor. The first collective farm has appeared on the grasslands of northern Manchuria. In the old days, sunshine never reached the roofs of farmers' houses, but now this place is illuminated by bright electric lights at night; rural women sit under the lights, reading and learning to write. The songs of victorious battles resound from the countryside to the cities. In the cities, we have defeated the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and we are cleansing corruption and theft from our society. New people and new virtues are growing among us. You only need to think about our past, present, and future, how can we not love our motherland. The motherland is our life, our everything. Now, America is spreading bacteria in our Northeast, destroying our happiness. Our heroic Chinese people have the strength and confidence to eliminate it!
    The crimes of the American murderers have aroused the anger of the people of the world.
    The bloody hands of the murderers have been seized, but they are still playing a game of tantrums and賴皮(Lài pí - Shameless/brazen). This is the ugly face of Truman, Acheson, and Ridgway, this group of cannibals, in front of the people of the world today. When they strangle the people, their hearts are the most sinister, and their hands are the most ruthless. When they are震懾(zhèn hè - overawed/daunted) by the just voice of the world, they try their best to lie and deny it. This is precisely the essence of American fascism, the despicable, shameless, greedy, and insidious essence of a combination of big capitalists, petty bourgeoisie, parvenus, and human traffickers.
    The murderers say: "I didn't kill anyone!" The thief shouts: "There is no silver buried here!" This tune is not new at all. The bacteria of American fascism are inherited from the breeding grounds of German and Japanese fascism. Cohen's shameless "denial" and Acheson's狂吠(kuáng fèi - frenzied barking) "investigation" are just a reprint of Goebbels' lies. In fact, this crime has long been proven in Acheson's camp. A journalist named Dillman reported: "Those who know the inside story are unwilling to say how far the United States has progressed in studying weapons that can eliminate the residents of entire cities without destroying a single house. Since 1947, news about bacteriological warfare has been strictly sealed off. But bits and pieces of news have been published. These bits and pieces add up to a terrible possibility: military researchers may have been able to create weapons that are relatively simple and less expensive to大规模(dà guī mó - large scale) destroy people, crops, and livestock." The New York Times "Science Overview" column stated even more specifically: "During the last war, approximately four thousand American scientists explored the possibility of bacteriological warfare, conducting research in laboratories established in Maryland, Mississippi, Utah, and Indiana." On January 28, when American bacteriological war criminals dropped the first batch of bacteria in the air over Korea, General Cleese, Research Director of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said: "I believe that the weapons we are researching can enable us to weaken the enemy's resistance at the lowest cost. thereby achieving victory without destroying its economy. … Unlike atomic bombs or other explosive weapons, biological weapons are mainly aimed at people, because these weapons do not damage buildings and machines, but are used to attack people themselves or people's food—livestock and grain." While毒菌(dú jūn - poisonous bacteria) are killing the lives of peaceful people, these demons are calculating "the least costly" way to achieve "economy without destruction." Look, isn't this the kind of laughter at a blood feast that only savages and beasts can make? But Acheson's denial is useless, because the evidence cannot be eliminated, the bloody hands have been seized, and the people's blood is dripping from these hands.
    The struggle of the people of the world for justice once again proves that peace will surely defeat war. In the face of the tide of justice, the warmongers can only tremble. Malik's stern and righteous rebuke made Cohen unable to answer a single word. The British government wanted to defend the murderers, but could not find a basis, so it had to find the murderers themselves as witnesses, who said that he "had inquired with the United States government and the United Nations Command in Korea on this matter." The peace-loving people of the world have protested against the crimes of American imperialism. Because every mother in the world knows how to love her children. Imperialism and plague are the mortal enemies of mankind. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes cannot save the fate of the failing American imperialism. Washington has already uneasily called the American operations in Korea a "twilight war" and a "terrible dilemma." These days, Van Fleet's headquarters bulletin is also叹气(tàn qì - sighing), saying: "The Korean front is blowing fiercely all day long, and the wind is mixed with snow and霰(xiàn - sleet)", but we know that spring has arrived. The spring of 1952 will bring the people new victories in the righteous struggle against bacteriological warfare. The road ahead for the American warmongers is not broad. When Truman was young, his mother praised Truman, saying: "No one in the country can dig as straight a ditch as Harry digs." Then this straight ditch is not towards other places but towards the Nuremberg Tribunal, towards the place where the German fascist bandits once stood with their heads bowed.

    坚决粉碎美国的细菌战
    刘白羽
    我到过朝鲜，我亲眼看见美国法西斯强盗在朝鲜已经制造了多么严重的罪行。
    我看见朝鲜每寸土地都渗透了鲜血，也渗透了仇恨，我知道朝鲜每个家庭都可以到正义的法庭上作证明，可是美国法西斯强盗现在又灭绝人性地向朝鲜散布了细菌。细菌是最残酷的杀人武器，美国一个名叫温特的教授早就狂叫：“一克腊肠杆菌可以消灭七百万人。”全世界早就用正义来制裁这种最不人道的野蛮兽行。一九二五年，四十六个国家签订日内瓦议定书：“禁用窒息瓦斯、毒气及细菌等武器”，一九四八年联合国又通过了“防止并惩办集体屠杀罪公约”。我们都知道，希特勒在欧洲的罪行比瘟疫还厉害，可是它还没有敢于把“波森研究所”里的疫菌炸弹使用起来。现在杜鲁门、艾奇逊、李奇微这批吸血鬼是完全丧心病狂了，他们把他们溅满了鲜血的手伸向朝鲜，现在，一批继一批的细菌又在向我们祖国土地上散布。
    我们爱我们的祖国，祖国是我们用鲜血换来的。为了祖国，我们从南方战斗到北方、又从北方战斗到南方，多少条河流，多少条山岗，多少个黑夜，又多少个白天，我们战斗着，我们英勇的中国人民终于打破了帝国主义所制造的东方黑暗，我们建立了光荣幸福、和平自由的国家。在我们祖国的土地上，每天都正在发生着许多可喜可爱的新鲜事情。
    我们深深耕种土地是为了提高谷物的产量，我们建设我们的城市和乡村，是为了让人们过美好的生活，在工厂和矿山里，劳动英雄创造着新纪录，巨大的建设工程，一个接一个在土地上出现。一九五二年的春天，会带来比往年更多的好消息，你看：一百多万民工已经上堤开始了第二年度的治淮工程；你看：苏北沿海已经动手建设一千多里长的防风林，这将使千百万农民免受海洋风暴、水旱灾害的痛苦，而且还可以减少空气中的盐分，改造土壤，使农作物得到良好的生长，保证丰收。我们的国家每一个时间都在前进，我们用劳动创造着新的奇迹。在北满草原上已经出现了第一个集体农庄，旧时代农民屋顶下那里照得到阳光，现在这个地方夜晚都照着雪亮的电灯；灯光下坐着读书识字的农村妇女。战斗胜利的歌声由乡村响到城市。在城市里我们战胜了资产阶级的进攻，我们从社会上清除着贪污和盗窃，在我们中间生长着新的人物和新的品德。你只要想一想我们的过去，今天和将来，我们怎能不爱我们的祖国。祖国就是我们的生命，就是我们的一切，现在美国竟在我国的东北撒布细菌，毁坏我们的幸福了。我们英勇的中国人民是有力量有信心消灭它的！
    美国杀人犯的罪行引起全世界人民的愤怒。
    杀人犯的血手已经被人捉牢，他还在玩一套撒泼耍赖的把戏，这就是今日杜鲁门、艾奇逊、李奇微这群吃人生番在世界人民面前的丑态。当他们绞杀人民的时候，他们的心最阴险，他们的手最毒辣，当他们被全世界正义的呼声所震慑的时候，他们就尽量撒谎抵赖，这一点正是由大资本家、市侩、暴发户和人贩子结合起来的，美国法西斯的本质，卑鄙无耻、贪婪险恶的本质。
    杀人的凶手说：“我没有杀人！”盗贼高喊：“此地无银三百两！”这种调子一点也不新鲜。美国法西斯的细菌是从德日法西斯温床上承继来的，柯亨无耻“否认”、艾奇逊狂吠“调查”，也只是戈培尔谎言的再版。实际上这种罪恶，在艾奇逊的阵营中早就得到了证明。一个叫作狄尔曼的记者报道：“知悉内幕的人都不愿说美国在研究这种可以不毁一房一屋而消灭整个整个城市的居民的武器方面已达到什么程度。自一九四七年以来，关于细菌战的消息是被严格封锁的。但点滴的消息曾经发表过。这些点滴的消息合起来，造成这样一个可怕的可能性：军事研究家可能已可以制造出能够大规模毁灭人、庄稼和牲畜的比较简单和比较花费少的武器。”纽约时报“科学一览”栏说得就更具体：“上次大战时，大约有四千名美国科学家探索细菌战的可能性，在马利兰州、密西西比州、犹他州及印地安纳州所建立的实验室中进行研究。”一月二十八日美国细菌战犯在朝鲜空中投下第一批细菌，就在这个时候，美国陆军化学兵团研究部长克利西将军说：“我相信我们正在研究的这种武器，可以使我们能够花最少的代价削弱敌人的抵抗力量。从而取得胜利，而不致毁灭它的经济。……和原子弹或者其他爆炸性的武器不一样，生物武器主要是对付人的，因为这种武器并不毁坏建筑物和机器，而是用来对付人本身或者人的食物——牲畜和谷物的。”当毒菌正在杀害着和平人民生命的时候，这些恶魔却在那里计算着“花费最少的代价”来取得“不致毁灭的经济”，你看，这不是只有生番和野兽，才能作这样血筵上的喧笑吗？可是艾奇逊的抵赖是无用的，因为罪证无法消除，血手已经被人捉牢，人民的鲜血正从这手上往下滴落。
    世界人民为了正义而进行的斗争，又一次证明和平必定战胜战争。在正义的怒涛面前，战争贩子只有发抖。马立克词严义正的斥责使柯亨一个字也答不出来，英国政府想替杀人犯辩护，可又找不到根据，结果只好把杀人犯自己找来当见证人，他说他“就这事询问过美国政府和朝鲜联合国军司令部”。全世界爱好和平的人民都对美帝国主义的罪恶行为发出抗议的呼声。因为全世界的母亲那一个不知道爱孩子。帝国主义、瘟疫，是人类的死敌。苍蝇、跳蚤和蚊虫是无法挽救美帝国主义失败的命运的。在华盛顿已经不安地把美国人在朝鲜的作战叫作“薄暮的战争”、“可怖的进退维谷”。这几天范佛里特的司令部公报也在叹气，他说：“朝鲜战线上整日猛烈的刮着大风，风里又夹着雪和霰”，可是我们知道，春天已经到来。一九五二年春天带给人民的将是反细菌战正义斗争的新胜利，美国战争贩子面前的路并不广阔，杜鲁门小的时候，他的母亲曾夸奖杜鲁门说：“国内没有一个人能够挖像哈里所挖的那样直的沟”，那么他这条直的沟不是向着旁处而是向着纽伦堡法庭，向着德国法西斯匪徒曾经垂头站立过的那个地方前进的。
