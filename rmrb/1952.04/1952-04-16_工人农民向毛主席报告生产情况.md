Workers and Peasants Report Production Situation to Chairman Mao

The iron riveting team of the repair shop of the Fugiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province completed the first quarter's production task ahead of schedule, saving the state more than 30,000 jin of millet.

Dear Chairman Mao: We are the workers of the iron riveting team of the repair shop of the Fugiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province. When we saw the news that American aggressors were spreading bacteria and poisonous insects in the Northeast and Qingdao of our motherland, everyone was extremely angry. We are determined to take practical actions and achieve victory on both the production and "Three-Anti" fronts at the same time to fight back against the inhuman atrocities of the American aggressors.

Under your and the Party's wise leadership, we launched a vigorous "Three-Anti" movement. This movement directly inspired everyone's production enthusiasm. In the past, the screws on coal cars were prone to falling off, the quality was poor, and accidents occurred frequently. Now we have corrected the phenomenon of falling off and guaranteed that the quality reaches 100%. We improved the operating method of the coal car platform, thereby ensuring the quantity and quality of products, and the work efficiency has more than doubled compared to last year. We completed the first quarter's production task ahead of schedule, saving the country 38,760 jin of millet.

Workers of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Create Three New Records

Dear Chairman Mao: All Party members and staff of our steelmaking department have carefully formulated the 1952 production plan and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. In order to do a good job in both production and the "Three-Anti" movement, we have all been mobilized. Labor model Wang Guiying used to get off work at 12 o'clock, but during the most intense period, he didn't get off work for five days and five nights, and he organized the "Three Shifts" production competition. Now 24 teams have participated in the competition, and even the repair department, which never participated in the competition in the past, has been swept into the competition upsurge. Wang Guiying also improved the "Three Shifts" system, strengthened the workers' overall concept, and achieved close cooperation between the departments. Therefore, a new atmosphere has emerged on our production front. We have created three new records: the smelting time has been shortened from 8 minutes and 12 seconds to 7 minutes and 19 seconds; the operating rate has increased from 71% to 81.2%; and the monthly output has exceeded last June's new record by 5.46%. We volunteered to process 729 work pieces, completing the February task of rushing to repair the open hearth furnace 24 hours ahead of schedule, adding 450,000 jin of millet to the country's wealth. Open hearth technician Wang Dianying made a rationalization proposal, saving 80,000 jin of millet. Due to the improvement of technology, we completed the March production task four days ahead of schedule, and improved product quality and reduced costs. Old worker Zhang An said: "Without the 'Three-Anti' movement and without defeating the bad elements, how could the workers be so energetic in production!"

We will never be complacent because of this. We will definitely continue to learn from advanced experience with an open mind. We guarantee to overfulfill the April production task. To welcome the great "May Day" Labor Day, we propose a friendly production competition to the city's workers in order to learn from each other and exchange experience. We will support the Chinese People's Volunteers with such practical actions and smash the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. All Party members and staff of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant

Employees of the Datong Engineering Team of the General Administration of Electric Power Guarantee that Electricity Generation on April 1st Has Now Been Completed Ahead of Schedule

Respected Chairman Mao: In our letter to Minister Chen Yu of the Central Fuel Industry Department last December 10, we promised you that we would complete our project plan by the end of March this year to ensure power generation on April 1st. Now we have generated electricity three days ahead of schedule.

For more than three months, we have never forgotten the guarantee we made to you. We firmly remember the slogan "Guarantee power generation on April 1st and report good news to Chairman Mao." This slogan constantly encourages our enthusiasm and creativity. Regarding the issue of engineering material supply, we have reversed the passive state of the past, actively collected inventory materials from all aspects, and promptly purchased the main materials that were lacking. Through contact contracts, we ensured the timely supply of materials. In terms of construction progress, we changed the organizational form of construction, so that the various parts of the work in the construction were closely coordinated; the administrative leaders had planned control of the progress of the project and promptly solved the problems in the project; all workers and the administrative side signed collective contracts; the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League unified their steps and solved the problems we encountered in the construction, encouraging us to adhere to the "Three-Anti" and production work with a fighting attitude. This "Three-Anti" struggle has made us further realize that the Party and the state power you lead are the working class's own power. In order to consolidate our regime, we have completed the tasks given by the Party and the government on the "Three-Anti" front; and under the conditions that manpower and time were less sufficient than planned, we completed the project task ahead of schedule. In addition to reporting good news to you, all of our employees are preparing to summarize our achievements and shortcomings in order to further improve future basic construction.

Railway Labor Model Yang Guoliang's Shunting Team Guarantees to Improve Work Efficiency to Fight Back Against the Bacteriological Warfare Launched by the American Aggressors

Dear Chairman Mao: After our team members saw in the newspaper that the heinous American aggressors violated international law and ignored the warnings of the people of the world, spreading poisonous bacteria in the Northeast and Qingdao of our motherland, they were extremely angry. We must respond to the government's call, turn anger into strength, improve work efficiency, and fight back against the bacteriological warfare launched by the American robbers who are laden with blood debts. We make the following guarantees to you:

(1) Strengthen the study of advanced experience, thoroughly promote the Li Xikui shunting method and the Mamidov pick-up and delivery method to shorten vehicle dwell time.

(2) Abide by labor discipline, formulate rules and regulations, eliminate all accidents, and strive to achieve four years without accidents (now we have achieved three years and eleven months without accidents).

(3) In shunting operations, avoid reverse hooks and unapproved compilations, shorten train formation time by 68.5% according to standards, shorten train dismantling time by 56% according to standards, shorten transit time by 42%, shorten dwell time by 22%, and shorten pick-up and delivery time by 60%.

(4) Carry the anti-corruption struggle to the end, combine fighting "tigers" with production, and strive for victory on both fronts.

(5) Actively participate in environmental sanitation and epidemic prevention work, continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible.

All Party Members of Jiebankiao Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, Report on the Situation of Organizing and Developing Production

Respected Chairman Mao: Under the leadership of the Party branch, on March 8, we studied Comrade Gao Gang's report on "The Direction of Rural Economic Development" and reviewed the development of agricultural production in our village over the past three years. Now we report the review situation to you as follows:

The Communist Party member Yang Fengshan mutual aid team was originally a seasonal mutual aid team. Because everyone personally experienced the benefits of being organized, they gradually improved the seasonal mutual aid team to a long-term, fixed-type mutual aid team, and progressed from labor cooperation to economic cooperation, collectively purchased mountain land, collectively reclaimed wasteland, planted trees, and bought farm tools. Last December, this mutual aid team developed into an agricultural land cooperative, with 22 households participating, land and labor were all invested in shares, and unified planning and rational management were implemented, which further exerted the potential of agricultural production and improved the living standards of all members.

Last year, although the number of mutual aid teams in our village was nine less than the previous year, the quality of the mutual aid teams improved. Everyone expressed that they would organize 97.7% of the peasants this year.

After the Spring Festival this year, the Party branch promptly grasped the consolidation of mutual aid teams. Branch leaders and propagandists extensively publicized the mutual aid policy and promoted 15 reading groups to study Comrade Gao Gang's report on "The Direction of Rural Economic Development." Labor model Yang Fengshan personally went to various natural villages to conduct patient persuasion and education to the mutual aid team members, organizing them to visit good mutual aid teams, so that they could realize the superiority of mutual aid and cooperative production. Now there are a total of 12 mutual aid teams and one land cooperative in the village. Now the peasants are holding mutual aid meetings to discuss the issue of gathering public accumulation funds, purchasing farm tools, and expanding production.

We have the following four experiences in organizing mutual aid teams:

1. Hold combined meetings regularly to summarize and exchange experience, achieving a three-way combination of technology, propaganda education, and leadership.

2. The Party branch attaches importance to the education of real people and real deeds, and mobilizes the masses to organize and fight against disasters by recalling history.

3. The mutual aid team leader must promote a democratic style and earnestly implement the mutual aid policy of equality and voluntariness.

4. Pay attention to political education to improve the peasants' awareness, so as to consolidate and develop the mutual aid team. All Party members of the Jiebankiao Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province

    工人农民向毛主席报告生产情况
    山西富家滩煤矿修理场铁铆组工人提前完成第一季
    生产任务为国家节约三万多斤小米
    亲爱的毛主席：我们是山西省富家滩煤矿修理场铁铆组的工人。我们看到美国侵略者在祖国东北、青岛撒布细菌毒虫的消息，每个人都愤怒万分。我们决心以实际行动，在生产和“三反”两大战线上同时获得胜利，回击美国侵略者惨无人道的暴行。
    在您和党的英明领导下，我们展开了轰轰烈烈的“三反”运动。这一运动，直接鼓舞了大家的生产积极性。过去，煤车上的螺丝门子容易脱落，质量不好，不断发生事故。现在我们纠正了脱落的现象，保证质量达到百分之百。我们改进了煤车台的操作方法，进而保证了产品的数量和质量，工作效率比去年提高了一倍以上。我们提前完成了第一季的生产任务。给国家节约了三万八千七百六十斤小米。

    太原钢铁厂炼钢部工人创造三项新纪录
    亲爱的毛主席：我们炼钢部全体党员和职工，认真地制定了一九五二年的生产计划，展开了增产节约运动。为了把生产和“三反”都搞好，我们全部动员起来了。劳动模范王贵英每天十二点钟下班，在最紧张的时候，他有五天五夜没有下班，并且组织了“三大班”生产竞赛。现在有二十四个小组参加了竞赛，连过去从不参加竞赛的修理系，也卷入了竞赛热潮。王贵英还改进了“三大班”制度，加强了工人的整体观念，作到各系之间的密切配合。因此，我们在生产战线上出现了新气象。我们创造了三个新纪录：冶炼时间从八点十二分缩短到七点十九分；作业率从百分之七十一提高到百分之八十一点二；月产量已超过去年六月份新纪录的百分之五点四六。我们义务加工七二九个工，使二月份抢修平炉的任务提前二十四小时完成，给国家增加了四十五万斤小米的财富。平炉技师王殿英提了一个合理化建议，节省了八万斤小米。由于改进了技术，我们提前四天完成了三月份的生产任务，并且提高了产品质量和降低了成本。老工人张安说：“没有‘三反’，不打垮坏分子，工人生产那能够这样有劲啊！”
    我们决不因此而骄傲自满，我们一定继续虚心学习先进经验。我们保证超额完成四月份的生产任务。为迎接伟大的“五一”劳动节，我们向全市工人提出友谊的生产竞赛，以便相互学习，交流经验。我们以这样的实际行动来支持中国人民志愿军，粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战。太原钢铁厂炼钢部全体党员及全体职工
    电业管理总局大同工程队职工向毛主席保证四月一日发电现在已经提前完成了
    敬爱的毛主席：去年十二月十日，我们请中央燃料工业部陈郁部长转给您的信中，曾经向您保证：我们要在今年三月底完成我们的工程计划，保证在四月一日发电。现在我们已经提前三天发电了。
    三个多月以来，我们每时每刻都没有忘记过向您所作的保证。我们牢牢地记着“保证四月一日发电，向毛主席报喜”的口号。这个口号，经常鼓舞着我们的积极性和创造性。关于工程材料供应问题，我们已扭转了过去被动的状态，主动向各方面搜集库存材料，及时采购缺乏的主要材料，通过联系合同，保证材料的及时供应。在施工的进度上，我们改变了施工的组织形式，使施工中的各部分工作密切配合起来；行政领导干部有计划地掌握了工程进度，及时解决了工程中的问题；全体工人和行政方面订立了集体合同；党、行政、工会、青年团统一了步调，解决了我们在施工中遇到的问题，鼓励我们以战斗姿态坚持“三反”和生产工作。这次“三反”斗争，使我们更进一步地认识到党和您所领导的国家政权是工人阶级自己的政权。为了巩固我们的政权，我们在“三反”战线上完成了党和政府所给予的任务；并在人力和时间都较预定计划更不充足的条件下，提前完成了工程任务。我们全体职工除向您报喜外，正准备总结成绩和缺点，为进一步搞好今后基本建设而努力。

    铁路劳动模范杨国良调车组保证提高工作效率回击美国侵略者发动的细菌战
    亲爱的毛主席：我们小组的同志在报上看到了万恶的美国侵略者违反国际公法，不顾全世界人民的警告，在我们祖国东北、青岛撒布毒菌的消息后，愤恨已极。我们要响应政府的号召，把愤怒化成力量，提高工作效率，回击血债累累的美国强盗发动的细菌战。我们向您提出保证：
    （一）加强学习先进经验，彻底推行李锡奎调车法、马米多夫取送车法，以缩短车辆停留时间。
    （二）遵守劳动纪律，制订规章制度，消灭一切事故，争取达到四年无事故（现在已经达到三年十一个月无事故）。
    （三）调车作业中不反钩、不违编，列车编组时间按标准缩短百分之六十八点五，列车解体时间按标准缩短百分之五十六，中转时间缩短百分之四十二，停留时间缩短百分之二十二，取送车时间缩短百分之六十。
    （四）把反贪污斗争进行到底，做到打“虎”和生产结合，争取两条战线的胜利。
    （五）积极参加环境卫生和防疫工作，继续开展增产节约运动，努力支援中国人民志愿军，早日打垮美国侵略军。　　　　白城子车站全国铁路劳动模范杨国良调车组
    山西省平顺县界畔峧村全体党员报告组织起来发展生产的情形
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在党支部领导下，三月八日学习了高岗同志关于“农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告，并且检查了本村三年来农业生产发展的情况。现在把检查情况向您报告如下：
    共产党员杨峰山互助组，原来是个季节性的互助组。由于大家亲身体验到组织起来的好处，就把季节性的互助组逐步提高到长期定型的互助组，并从劳力合作进步到经济合作，集体购买了山地，集体开荒、植树、买农具。去年十二月，这个互助组又发展成为农业土地合作社，有二十二户参加，土地、劳力都入了股，实行统一计划，合理经营，进一步发挥了农业生产的潜在力，提高了全体社员的生活水平。
    去年我们村里的互助组虽然比前年少了九个组，但互助组的质量提高了。大家表示要在今年把百分之九十七·七的农民组织起来。
    今年春节后，党支部就抓紧整顿互助组。支部领导宣传员深入宣传互助政策，推动十五个读报组学习高岗同志关于“农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告。劳动模范杨峰山亲自到各自然村，向互助组员进行耐心的说服教育，组织他们参观好的互助组，使他们认识到互助合作生产的优越性。现在全村共有十二个互助组，一个土地合作社。现在农民们纷纷召开互助会，商量聚集公积金，购买农具，扩大生产的问题。
    我们在组织互助组工作中，有下面的四点体会：
    一、定期召开结合会，总结和交流经验，作到技术、宣传教育、领导三结合。
    二、党支部重视真人真事的教育，通过回忆历史，发动群众组织起来，和灾荒作斗争。
    三、互助组长要发扬民主作风，认真执行平等自愿的互助政策。
    四、注意政治教育，提高农民觉悟，以巩固和发展互助组。中共山西省平顺县界畔峧村支部全体党员
