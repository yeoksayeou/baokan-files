Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS

    The International Economic Conference, held in Moscow from April 3rd to 12th, 1952, was convened at the initiative of people in business, economists, trade union workers, and cooperative workers, with the aim of discussing "the possibilities of improving the living conditions of the people through peaceful cooperation among countries and various systems, and through the development of economic relations among countries." The conference brought together 471 attendees, mainly representatives from the business community of the following 49 countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, German Democratic Republic, West Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Netherlands, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mexico, Mongolian People's Republic, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam.

    The International Economic Conference believes that it is necessary to call the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the disruption and alienation of international economic relations caused by various artificial restrictions and obstacles, which have been particularly numerous in the past few years. As a result, the national economies of many countries are encountering serious difficulties, such as imbalances in payments, restrictions on the import of necessities, rising prices, increasing unemployment, slow industrial development, severe food shortages, and deteriorating living conditions for the people of various countries.

    At the same time, as has been demonstrated at the conference, enormous possibilities exist for increasing the volume of international trade and expanding international trade areas. The conference itself illustrates the extreme desire of business people from various countries to take advantage of these possibilities for further expansion of international trade.

    The conference believes that, in accordance with Article 55 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has a responsibility to promote "higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development."

    Under the present circumstances, the development of international trade is particularly important.

    Therefore, the International Economic Conference calls upon the United Nations General Assembly to convene as early as possible a conference of government representatives with the participation of business people, trade unions, and other social organizations from various countries, in order to promote the expansion of international trade on the basis of equality and appropriate consideration of the special needs of industrialization in underdeveloped countries.

    国际经济会议致联合国大会书
    一九五二年四月三日至十二日在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，是在工商界人士、经济学家、工会工作者和合作事业工作者倡议之下召开的，其目的在于讨论“经由各国和各种制度间的和平合作，经由发展各国间的经济关系，来寻求改善人民生活状况的可能性”。会议使四百七十一位到会者齐集一堂，他们主要是来自下列四十九个国家的企业界代表：阿尔巴尼亚、阿根廷、澳大利亚、奥地利、比利时、巴西、保加利亚、缅甸、加拿大、锡兰、智利、中华人民共和国、古巴、捷克斯洛伐克、塞浦路斯、丹麦、埃及、芬兰、法国、德意志民主共和国、西德、大不列颠、希腊、荷兰、匈牙利、冰岛、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、以色列、意大利、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、黎巴嫩、卢森堡、墨西哥、蒙古人民共和国、挪威、巴基斯坦、巴拉圭、波兰、罗马尼亚、瑞典、瑞士、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、美利坚合众国、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉、越南。
    国际经济会议认为：必须唤起联合国大会注意各种人为限制和障碍（这种人为限制和障碍在过去几年特别多）所造成的国际经济关系的断绝与疏远。结果，许多国家的国民经济正在遭遇到严重的困难，这就是收支不平衡、必需品入口受到限制、物价上涨、失业人数增加、工业发展缓慢、粮荒严重和各国人民生活状况恶化。
    同时，像会议上已经证明的一样，增加国际贸易量和扩大国际贸易地区的巨大可能性是存在着的。会议本身说明了各国企业界人士都极其希望利用这些进一步扩大国际贸易的可能性。
    会议认为：根据联合国宪章第五十五条，联合国有责任促进“较高之生活程度、全民就业及经济与社会进展”。
    在目前情况下，发展国际贸易特别重要。
    因此，国际经济会议吁请联合国大会尽早召开一次有各国企业界人士、工会及其他社会团体参加的政府代表会议，以便促进在平等与适当照顾落后国家工业化的特殊需要的基础上扩大国际贸易。
