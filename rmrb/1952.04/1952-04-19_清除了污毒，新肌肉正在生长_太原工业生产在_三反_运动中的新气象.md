    Cleansing the filth, new muscles are growing
    — New atmosphere in Taiyuan's industrial production during the "Three-Anti" campaign
    By our special correspondent Wu Xiang
    The steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created three new records in January this year: increased operating rate, shortened smelting time, and increased monthly output; in February, it completed 105.46 percent of its task; and in March, it completed its monthly task ahead of schedule by four days, reducing the scrap rate from the quota of 2 percent to 1.47 percent, improving quality, and reducing costs. The production achievements of the steelmaking department are encouraging, but this is just one of the many encouraging news from Taiyuan. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, a large number of vigorous new atmospheres are emerging in state-owned and provincial-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan.
    During the "Three-Anti" campaign, workers saw the fruits of their hard work and savings being shamelessly swallowed by embezzlers and thieves. They were filled with anger and hatred for the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. They were full of energy in "beating tigers" and did not relax their efforts in production. Many responsible cadres in factories and mines were also deeply educated in the "Three-Anti" campaign. They criticized their own bureaucracy, improved their leadership style, and further strengthened their ties with the masses. The leading cadres of the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot used to have a very serious procrastination style. Some small problems were often delayed for a long time without being resolved. Now, the leading cadres go deep into the site, strengthen inspections, and establish daily business meetings to solve problems in a timely manner. The phenomenon of procrastination in document processing no longer exists. For example, recently, after the locomotive was converted to burning Datong coal, the firebox steel bricks often collapsed, hindering driving. The section chief and director immediately went to the site and worked with the workers to study the problem. They eliminated the mud between the bricks and squeezed the bricks together, and the problem was solved. The workers said: "The 'Three-Anti' campaign has eliminated bureaucracy. The director is often with us. We discuss things immediately when something happens. We are particularly energetic in our work." In this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers can be given fuller play.
    In the midst of the intense "tiger beating" battle, most of the state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan have overfulfilled their production tasks. Inventions, technological transformations, and various new records are constantly emerging among the workers. Here, only a few of the more prominent examples can be cited. Workers Su Maodan and Huo Yulin of the Taiyuan Second Factory of Shanxi Flour Company improved the flour milling equipment, changing the original 17.5-inch pulley to 24.5-inch, which increased the speed by 30 revolutions, adjusted the powder rate, and improved product quality, which can increase production by 7.46 billion yuan per year. Liu Qijie and other three groups of Taiyuan Machine Factory improved the smelting technology, shortening the steelmaking time by 46.6 percent. The cost of electricity alone can save 210 million yuan per year, and the output can be increased by more than double. Dongshan Coal Mine changed the single-bucket lifting of the Heishaping pithead to double-bucket lifting, which increased the lifting rate by more than double, and can save 800,000 jin of millet this year. The staff and workers of Shanxi Machine Company improved the core box for making leather wire bottom support in January, which can save two man-days per day; in February, after changing the figure-eight wheel to no longer using sand belts and lower core tires, three people can increase production by 20 pieces per day; improving the loading method of the iron braising furnace can save more than 13,500 jin of coal. After the staff and workers of Jinsheng Textile Factory successfully tested the "1951 Weaving Work Method" and "Front Roller Speed ​​Up", they created more than 612 million yuan of wealth for the country in February. The staff and workers of the Waterworks Company have successfully tested five types of water meters. Hu Zhongyi, a worker in the electric saw room of Xishan Coal Mine, worked while "beating tigers," and modified a small circular saw and a drill cap, which increased work efficiency by more than four times. Yang Junfeng, a worker at Taiyuan Railway Factory, created a new record of cutting 108 meters per minute when making the middle drawbar cylinder of the Мука 5-type locomotive on March 8, which increased work efficiency by two times. The Guo Guangdou crew of Taiyuan Railway South Station Locomotive Depot safely completed a new record of 10,257.8 kilometers of trial operation from February 24 to March 21, which improved the locomotive turnover rate and can save 104 million yuan in labor and material costs per year. The inventions, creations, and new records mentioned here were all created under the circumstances of "beating tigers" while producing. There is no doubt that when the "Three-Anti" campaign is successfully concluded and the focus is fully shifted to the increase production and practice economy movement, there will be more new and more encouraging records.
    The great "Three-Anti" campaign is eradicating the filth left over from the old society with irresistible force. The managers and marketing departments of many factories and mines have become corrupt and deteriorated under the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. After the major embezzlers were cleared out, the personnel of these institutions have not been replenished and equipped in a timely manner, which has once affected production. The leading cadres of each factory and mine are relying on the masses to solve these problems. Now, many Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and worker activists who have always been honest, selfless, and hardworking are being promoted to leadership positions at all levels. Among the 57 cadres above the level of section chief and division chief newly promoted by the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau after the "Three-Anti" campaign, 36 were directly selected from the workers. Although these activists are temporarily unfamiliar with the business, they are loyal to the people's cause, have a good style of linking with the masses, have the courage to overcome difficulties, and are willing to study hard. Therefore, it will not be long before they can be competent in their new jobs. The changes in the business department of Taiyuan Woolen Mill before and after the "Three-Anti" campaign well illustrate this problem. Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, this department had essentially become a "fortress" installed by the bourgeoisie in the woolen mill. Guo Shuren, the deputy section chief, was a mole sent in by illegal capitalists. All six people in the section, except for two newcomers, were pulled into his embezzlement group by him. They colluded with unscrupulous merchants and stole more than 600 million yuan of national wealth by various despicable means. Guo Shuren not only privately signed "purchase and sales contracts" with unscrupulous merchants, allowing unscrupulous merchants to control the sales of woolen mill's wool fabrics, but even notified Liang Jiuquan, the manager of the Hengxingkui Wool Shop, a private merchant who colluded with him, to "prepare well" (add water and sand) every time the woolen mill purchased wool. Liang Jiuquan repeatedly mixed waste wool bought back from the woolen mill at a low price with good wool and sold it to the woolen mill at a high price. This is the main reason why the production of woolen mill could not be improved in the past. This major theft case was solved in this campaign, and the old business department collapsed. The leading cadres of the woolen mill boldly promoted workers Cao Changfu and Chen Youji, etc., and organized a new business organization with two people from the original business department (one had no problem, and one had thoroughly confessed). They indeed had little experience in business work and encountered many setbacks at first. But they said: "As long as you are diligent in talking, diligent in walking, and willing to use your brains, any difficulties can be overcome." The determination to serve the people wholeheartedly made them conquer difficulties, successfully solve the supply and sales problems of the entire factory, and open up new sales networks. Another example is Li Dazhi, an outstanding combatant who bravely fought against the major thief Zhang Yue. Since he was promoted to the deputy director of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau Construction Section, the work of the entire section has made rapid progress. He criticized the bourgeois viewpoint of only emphasizing formal aesthetics and not seeking practicality in construction work; and he reassigned groups according to each person's strengths and promoted the Kovalev work method, which significantly improved work efficiency. In the past, it took four days to prepare a design budget or final account statement, but now it only takes one day. In the past, it took fifty people a month to complete the final accounts of 348 projects, but under the leadership of Li Dazhi, it took only more than thirty people eighteen days to complete them. The great "Three-Anti" struggle "on the one hand, resolutely removed all rotten things by revolutionary means, and on the other hand, grew and is widely growing many positive and infinitely dynamic new things." This point is now very clear.

    清除了污毒，新肌肉正在生长
    ——太原工业生产在“三反”运动中的新气象
    本报特约记者　吴象
    太原钢铁厂炼钢部，今年一月份创造了作业率增加、冶炼时间缩短、月产量提高的三个新纪录；二月份完成任务百分之一百零五点四六；三月份又提前四天超额完成全月任务，废品率由定额百分之二减到百分之一点四七，质量提高，成本降低。炼钢部的生产成绩是令人振奋的，但这只不过是太原市许多令人振奋的消息中的一个。在“三反”运动中，太原市的国营省营厂矿中，大量地出现着蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    在“三反”运动中，职工们看到自己辛辛苦苦劳动节约的成果，被贪污犯盗窃犯无耻地侵吞了，他们对资产阶级的猖狂进攻充满了愤怒和仇恨，“打虎”的劲头十足，对生产也不放松。许多厂矿的负责干部，在“三反”运动中也都受到深刻的教育，批判了自己的官僚主义，改进了领导作风，进一步密切了和群众的联系。太原北站机务段的领导干部，过去拖拉作风很严重，一些小问题往往也拖延很久不能解决。现在领导干部深入现场，加强检查，并建立了每日业务碰头会，及时解决问题，来回行文拖拉的现象不再存在了。比如，最近机车改烧大同煤以后，火室钢砖常常倒塌，妨碍行车。段长、主任立即深入现场和工人共同研究，取消了砖和砖的缝隙间的夹泥，把砖互相挤紧，问题就解决了。工人们说：“‘三反’把官僚主义反掉了，主任常和我们在一块儿，有事马上商量，工作干着特别有劲。”这样，广大职工的积极性和创造性就有条件得以更为充分地发挥。
    就在紧张的“打虎”战斗中，太原市大部分的国营厂矿都超额完成了生产任务。工人中的创造发明、技术改造和各种新纪录正不断地出现。这里只能举些比较突出的例子。山西面粉公司太原第二厂的工人苏毛旦、霍玉林等改进了磨粉设备，把原来十七点五吋的皮带轮改为二十四点五吋，使速度加快了三十转，调剂了粉率，提高了产品质量，全年可增产七十四亿六千万元。太原机器厂刘启杰等三个小组，改进了熔炼技术，使炼钢时间缩短了百分之四十六点六，单只电费一项，全年就可以节省两亿一千万元；增产在一倍以上。东山煤矿把黑沙坪坑井口的单罐提升改成双罐提升，提升率增加了一倍多，今年可节省小米八十万斤。山西机器公司的职工，一月份改进了做皮线底托的心合，每天能节省两个人工；二月份做八字轮改为不用沙带及下心子胎后，每天三个人就可增产二十个；改进了焖铁炉的装料法，节省煤炭一万三千五百多斤。晋生纺织厂职工，试验“一九五一织布工作法”及“前罗拉速度加快”成功后，二月份就给国家多创造了六亿一千二百多万元的财富。自来水公司职工试装了五种水表，都已成功。西山煤矿电锯房工人胡忠义，一面“打虎”一面工作，改装了一个小圆锯和一个钻帽，提高了工作效率四倍多。太原铁路工厂工人杨俊凤在三月八日作ムカ五型机车的中间拉杆筒时，创造了每分钟切削一百零八公尺的新纪录，使工作效率提高了两倍。太原铁路南站机务段郭光斗包乘组，从二月二十四日到三月二十一日，安全完成了试行一万零二百五十七点八公里的新纪录，提高了机车周转率，一年可节省人工材料等费用一亿零四百万元。这里所谈的发明创造和新纪录，都是在一面“打虎”一面生产的情况下创造出来的。毫无疑问，等到“三反”运动胜利结束，全力转向增产节约运动的时候，将会有更多更令人振奋的新纪录出现。
    伟大的“三反”运动，正在以不可抗拒的力量肃清旧社会遗留下来的污毒。不少厂矿的经理、供销部门，在资产阶级猖狂进攻之下，已经腐烂变质。在清除了大贪污分子之后，这些机构的人员还没有及时补充配备起来，因此，曾经一度影响了生产。各厂矿的领导干部都在依靠群众解决这些问题。现在，许多一贯廉洁奉公坚苦朴素的共产党员、青年团员、工人积极分子正被提拔到各级领导岗位上去。仅太原铁路分局在“三反”后新提拔的股长、科长级以上的干部五十七人中，直接从工人中选拔的就有三十六人。尽管这些积极分子暂时还不熟悉业务，但是他们对人民事业忠心耿耿，有联系群众的优良作风，有克服困难的勇气，肯埋头学习，因此，不要很久，他们对于新的工作就可以胜任愉快。太原毛织厂经营科在“三反”前后的变化就很好地说明了这个问题。“三反”前，这个科实质上已经变成资产阶级安在毛织厂的“堡垒”。副科长郭书仁是违法资本家派进来的坐探。全科六个人，除了两个新来的以外，都被他拉进了他的贪污集团。他们和奸商里应外合，用各种卑鄙的手段，盗窃了国家六亿多元的财富。郭书仁不但私自和奸商订“购销合同”，使奸商操纵了毛织厂毛呢的推销，甚至在毛织厂每次购毛时，通知和他勾结的奸商私营恒兴魁毛店经理梁九权“好好准备”（掺水、掺沙）。梁九权多次把贱价从毛织厂买回的废毛混在好毛里，又高价卖给了毛织厂。这就是过去毛织厂生产老搞不好的主要原因。这个大盗窃案在这次运动中破获了，旧的经营科垮了台。毛织厂的领导干部大胆地提拔了工人曹昌福、陈有技等，和原经营科的两个人（一个没有问题，一个有问题已彻底交代）组织了新的经营机构。他们对经营工作确实是很少经验的，起初碰了不少钉子。但他们却说：“只要嘴勤、腿勤、肯用脑筋，什么困难也能克服。”忠心耿耿为人民服务的决心，使他们征服了困难，顺利地解决了全厂的供销问题，并开辟了新的推销网。又如和大盗窃犯张悦英勇斗争的出色战斗员李大志，自从被提升担任太原铁路分局建筑段副段长以后，全段工作都有飞跃的进步。他批判了在建筑工作中只讲形式美观不求实用的资产阶级观点；并且根据各人特长重新分了组，推广了郭瓦廖夫工作法，使工作效率得以显著提高。过去做一份设计预算或决算表需要四天的时间，现在只需要一天就可以完成。过去用五十个人一个月时间没有完成的三百四十八件工程决算，在李大志领导下，只用了三十多个人十八天时间就完成了。伟大的“三反”斗争，“一方面是以革命手段坚决地去掉了一切腐烂的东西，另一方面生长了和正在广泛地生长着许多积极的有无限活力的新事物。”这一点，现在已经可以看得非常明显了。
