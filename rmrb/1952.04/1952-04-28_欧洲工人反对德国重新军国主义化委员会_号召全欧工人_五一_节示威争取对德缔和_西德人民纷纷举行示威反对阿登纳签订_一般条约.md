Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 25th: The European Workers' Committee Against German Remilitarization issued a call to all European men and women workers for the upcoming May Day, pointing out that Germany and the whole of Europe are in a dangerous situation. West German Federal Chancellor Adenauer, succumbing to the orders of the United States, and disregarding the will of the German people and the German working class, wants to conclude a militaristic "General Treaty" at any cost.

The call to all European men and women workers states: The Soviet Union's proposals to the United States, Britain, and France provide a foundation for maintaining peace in Europe and the world, enabling Germany to be in a state of peace and unity, and to establish friendly relations with all countries. At the same time, this will fully guarantee the safety of the peoples of Europe. For this reason, every man and woman worker facing a choice must now make the right decision: either the General Treaty that serves war—a treaty of death—or a peace treaty with Germany—a treaty that enables all peoples to live a happy life.

The call to all European men and women workers strongly urges: "Working men and women of Europe! Regardless of your party or union affiliation, regardless of your beliefs, international peace and friendship are the most sacred things that each of us must defend.

"Therefore, all of Europe must unite to demonstrate on May Day against drawing West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty through the 'General Treaty,' and strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

"Long live the united action of the European working class in the struggle against German remilitarization!"

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: As the danger of Western countries concluding the so-called "General Treaty" serving aggression with Adenauer approaches, the West German people are stepping up their opposition to Adenauer's traitorous policy, demanding the reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.

According to TASS: The central organ of the German Communist Party, "Freies Volk," called on West German workers to prevent the conclusion of the "General Treaty" serving war purposes through mass strikes. The paper wrote that Adenauer and American politicians, in violation of the will of the German people, arbitrarily intend to conclude the "General Treaty." The people should bravely defend their rights. Bonn and Washington intend to implement a policy of creating a fait accompli, eliminating the great opportunity provided to our people by the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty. Now our people should implement another policy of creating a fait accompli, which is to eliminate the threat looming over our people.

The paper pointed out that there are now all the preconditions for launching a broad mass movement against Adenauer's political line, and called on West German workers to act in unity. The paper called for immediate discussion and formulation of ways to combat the "General Treaty" in various enterprises and trade unions. The paper said:

"The workers' parties, connected with six and a half million trade union members, are strong enough to prevent the conclusion of the 'General Treaty.' If the united action of the workers attracts the entire German people into the movement, then Adenauer's and Washington's plans will be shattered. Mass marches and general strikes will prevent the conclusion of the 'General Treaty' and will direct the strength of the entire nation towards the struggle for German unity and for a peace treaty."

Currently, the movement of the West German people demanding the establishment of a unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty is growing in scale. Demonstrations are being held everywhere against Adenauer's attempt to conclude a "General Treaty" with Western countries aimed at accelerating preparations for another war.

On the evening of April 24th, mass demonstrations were held in many districts of West Germany.

In the working-class district of Wedding (French occupation zone), thousands of demonstrators formed a strong contingent, carrying flags and slogans with slogans against the "General Treaty," entered Brunnestrasse, and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty in accordance with the proposals of the Soviet government.

Many social celebrities in West Germany have also protested against Adenauer's traitorous policy, demanding a unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty.

Dr. Heinemann, former Minister of the Interior in Bonn, warned against signing the "General Treaty" full of war danger when he delivered a speech at a gathering in Darmstadt. He emphasized that all those who do not want a third world war must participate in the joint effort to establish an all-German government. He said: "We can only achieve German unity through the path of agreement among the four major powers."

Bonn parliamentarian Wessel wrote an article in the monthly magazine "Straight Talk" saying: "Maintaining peace must be the task of German policy." Wessel opposed West Germany's participation in the military blocs of Western countries, and he emphasized: "In fact, only by concluding a peace treaty between all the victorious countries and a unified Germany that is equal in law and politics can our country's equal status with other countries be restored. Otherwise, the division of Germany will deepen and the threat of war will increase… Reunifying Germany is not only the ardent desire of the German people, but also a way to eliminate the serious threats looming over the world." Wessel called on all German patriots to resolutely oppose West German remilitarization.

    欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会
    号召全欧工人“五一”节示威争取对德缔和
    西德人民纷纷举行示威反对阿登纳签订“一般条约”
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会为即将来到的五一节，发表告全欧男女工人书指出：德国与整个欧洲都处在危险情况下。西德联邦共和国总理阿登纳屈从美国的命令，不顾德国人民和德国工人阶级的意志，要不计任何代价地缔结军国主义的“一般条约”。
    告全欧男女工人书说：苏联致美国、英国、法国的建议，提供了维持欧洲和全世界和平的基础，使德国能处于和平与统一的状态中，并能与各国建立友好关系。同时，这将充分保证欧洲各国人民自己的安全。为了这个缘故，面临抉择的每个男女工人，现在必须作出正确的决定：还是为战争服务的一般条约——一个死亡的条约，还是对德和约——一个使各国人民都能过幸福生活的条约。
    告全欧男女工人书强有力地号召说：“欧洲的劳动男女们！不论你们所属的党派和工会，不论你们的信仰，国际和平与友好是我们每个人必须保卫的最神圣的东西。
    “因此，整个欧洲联合起来在五一节示威游行，反对借‘一般条约’而将西德拉入侵略性的北大西洋公约，争取缔结对德和约。
    “欧洲工人阶级在反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争中一致行动万岁！”
    【新华社二十六日讯】随着西方国家与阿登纳缔结为侵略服务的所谓“一般条约”的危险的逼近，西德人民正加紧反对阿登纳的卖国政策，要求重新统一德国和缔结全面和约。
    据塔斯社消息：德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民”号召西德劳动者以群众罢工阻止为战争目的服务的“一般条约”的缔结。该报写道，阿登纳和美国政界人物违反德国人民的意志，擅自打算缔结“一般条约”。人民应该奋勇保卫自己的权利。波恩与华盛顿打算执行造成既成事实的政策，消除苏联关于缔结和约的建议给我们人民提供的巨大机会。现在我们人民应该执行另一种造成既成事实的政策，这就是消除笼罩在我们人民头上的威胁。
    该报指出现在有一切先决条件展开广泛的群众运动来反对阿登纳的政治方针，并号召西德的劳动者一致行动。该报号召在各企业和工会立即着手讨论和拟定与“一般条约”进行斗争的办法。该报说：
    “与六百五十万工会会员联系着的各工人政党足够强大，足以阻止‘一般条约’的缔结。如果工人的统一行动把全德国人民吸引到运动中来，那么阿登纳和华盛顿的计划就会被粉碎。群众游行和普遍罢工将阻止‘一般条约’的缔结，并将使全民族的力量投向争取德国统一和争取和约的斗争。”
    目前西德人民要求建立统一的德国和缔结和约的运动，规模正愈来愈大。各地纷纷举行示威，反对阿登纳企图与西方国家缔结旨在加速准备另一次大战的“一般条约”。
    四月二十四日晚，西德许多区内举行群众示威。
    在工人聚居区韦定（法占区），数千名示威者组成一支坚强的队伍，携带写着反对“一般条约”的口号的旗帜与标语，进入勃勒耐斯特拉西，要求根据苏联政府的建议，缔结和约。
    西德的许多社会名流也都抗议阿登纳的卖国政策，要求统一德国并缔结和约。
    前波恩内政部长海纳曼博士在达姆斯塔德的一个集会上发表演说时，警告不要签订充满战争危险的“一般条约”。他强调说，凡是不希望发生第三次世界大战的人们，都必须参加争取成立全德政府的共同努力。他说：“我们只有通过四大国协议的途径才能获得德国统一。”
    波恩议会议员威塞尔在“直言”月刊写了一篇文章说：“保持和平必须是德国政策的任务。”威塞尔反对西德参加西方国家的军事集团，他强调说：“事实上，只有由一切战胜国家与一个在法律上和政治上平等的统一的德国缔结一个和约，才能恢复我国与其他国家的平等地位。否则，德国的分裂将趋加深，战争威胁也将增加……重新统一德国不仅是德国人民的热烈愿望，而且是消除笼罩在世界上的严重威胁的方法。”威塞尔要求全德的爱国人士坚决反对西德重新军国主义化。
