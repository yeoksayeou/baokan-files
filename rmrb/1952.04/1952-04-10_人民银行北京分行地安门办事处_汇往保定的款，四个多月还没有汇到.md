    The People's Bank of China Beijing Branch, Di'anmen Office:
    Remittance to Baoding Still Not Received After More Than Four Months
    Editor: On November 17th of last year, the North China General Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association remitted over 10 million yuan to the Hebei Province Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association through the Di'anmen Office of the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch. More than two months after the remittance, our association went to the office to exchange the original temporary receipt for a formal receipt. At that time, we discovered that the formal receipt did not have the payee's seal and questioned it. According to the person in charge of the remittance and exchange section of the office, "The money is guaranteed to have been received by the other party (Hebei Province Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association), but the procedure is not in accordance with regulations," the reason being that "the Hebei Province Branch of the People's Bank of China is careless in its work." In order to complete the procedure, our association agreed that the office would return the receipt to the Hebei Province Branch to add the seal. Four days later, our association suddenly received a letter from the Hebei Province Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, stating that the money had not yet been received. Our association immediately sent personnel to the office to speak with Li Yunfu, the section chief of the business section, asking them to pay attention to this matter, conduct a thorough investigation as soon as possible, and strive to completely solve the problem, and asked them to quickly inform us of the results. However, this matter has been delayed for more than two months, and the office has still not replied. On March 8th, our association sent personnel to find Li Yunfu, the business section chief of the office, but he avoided meeting them.
    Beijing and Baoding are not far apart, but this remittance has not been received after more than four months. This shows that the problems existing in the Di'anmen Office of the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch are very serious. Is it simply a backlog of remittances, or is there embezzlement? I suggest that the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch quickly send people to conduct a thorough investigation and make a public reply in the newspaper.                 Xiao Feng

### 人民银行北京分行地安门办事处  汇往保定的款，四个多月还没有汇到

    人民银行北京分行地安门办事处
    汇往保定的款，四个多月还没有汇到
    编辑同志：华北抗美援朝总分会在去年十一月十七日由中国人民银行北京分行地安门办事处汇往河北省抗美援朝分会款一千多万元。汇款后两个多月，我会到该办事处以原临时收据换取正式收据。当时我们发现正式收据无收款人盖章，就加以追问。据该办事处汇兑股负责人说：“此款保证对方
    （河北省抗美援朝分会）已经收到，只是手续不合”，原因是“人民银行河北省分行办事马虎”。我会为了把手续办妥，同意该办事处将收据退河北省分行补盖图章。过了四天，我会忽接河北省抗美援朝分会来信，说明此款尚未收到。我会即派员到该办事处找业务股股长李韵甫面谈，请他们重视这件事情，迅速深入检查，务求问题得到彻底解决，并请他们迅速把结果告诉我们。但此事拖延两个多月，到现在该办事处还没有答复。三月八日，我会又派员去找该办事处业务股长李韵甫，他竟避而不见。
    北京和保定距离并不远，这笔汇款汇了四个多月还没有汇到。这说明人民银行北京分行地安门办事处所存在的问题是很严重的。究竟是积压汇款，还是有贪污行为？我建议人民银行北京分行迅速派人深入检查，并在报上作公开答复。                 小冯
