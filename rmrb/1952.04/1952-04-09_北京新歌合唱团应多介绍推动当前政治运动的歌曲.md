    The Beijing New Song Chorus Should Introduce More Songs Promoting Current Political Movements

    The "Beijing New Song Chorus" has been established for almost a year now. In the past, their target audience was mostly students, and the new songs introduced were mostly three-part or four-part choruses and Soviet songs. This is certainly good, but the chorus has not done enough to introduce songs closely related to current political movements. Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement, and anti-bureaucratism struggle, the New Song Chorus has selected a few new songs for practice, but has not promoted them among the masses.

    I am a member of the "New Song Chorus," and I believe that it should use its full political enthusiasm to introduce songs that are closely related to current political movements. In the future, the "New Song Chorus" should also expand its scope of activities, follow the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, and frequently go to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to promote songs loved by the masses.

    北京新歌合唱团应多介绍推动当前政治运动的歌曲
    “北京新歌合唱团”成立已将近一年了，过去他们的对象大部分是学生，所介绍的新歌曲多是三部、四部的大合唱和苏联歌曲。这当然是好的，但该团对于紧密结合当前政治运动的歌曲，却介绍得很不够。从反贪污、反盗窃斗争展开以来，新歌合唱团虽然也选了几支新歌练习，但并未推广到群众中去。
    我是“新歌合唱团”的一个团员，我认为它应以饱满的政治热情来介绍与当前政治运动紧密结合的歌曲。“新歌合唱团”今后并应扩大活动范围，按照文艺为工农兵服务的方向，经常到广大工农兵群众中去，推广群众所喜爱的歌曲。张守铭
