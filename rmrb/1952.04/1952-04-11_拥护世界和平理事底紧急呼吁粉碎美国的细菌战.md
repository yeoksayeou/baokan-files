Uphold the World Peace Council's Urgent Appeal to Crush America's Bacteriological Warfare
He Sijing

The World Peace Council's "Appeal to Men and Women Worldwide Against Bacteriological Warfare" is an urgent call to safeguard human security and human justice.

Now is the time for humanity to rise up in self-defense.

Can the American aggressors still deny their heinous crime of waging bacteriological warfare? Of course, they dare not admit their guilt, but can any sophistry negate the ironclad facts?

What are the ironclad facts?

On the Korean battlefield and within Chinese territory, the ugly facts of dropping bacteriological bombs, releasing germ-carrying insects and germ-carrying animals, and even germ-ridden carrion and dead fish by airplanes have been confirmed by the on-the-spot investigation of the fair International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team.

Captured American and British soldiers have also provided evidence of American bacteriological warfare. It is no longer just the confessions of one or two prisoners that the aggressors injected their soldiers with "secret vaccinations." We also know that the US military uses American-made bacteriological shells in American newsreels.

Furthermore, a material published by the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee proves the U.S. Army Department's plan to further expand the preparations for biological warfare (bacteriological warfare). This is the testimony made by Brigadier General Bullene, commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, on March 3rd, and this testimony has been rigorously checked.

This last piece of evidence shows that the American aggressors are planning to expand their heinous crimes to the whole world.

The American aggressors have their outrageous and conscienceless robber reasons for committing such heinous crimes. At the end of January this year, Chrissey, the research minister of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, openly stated: Bacteriological weapons can enable them to "weaken the enemy's resistance at the least cost and thus achieve victory." He also said: If people get sick and die, the factories and houses will remain intact in the hands of the victors. On March 5 this year, Brigadier General Bullene, head of the Chemical Corps of the U.S. Department of Defense, advocated unlimited use of bacteriological weapons in the "Congressional Digest."

It couldn't be clearer, the American aggressors are planning and have already been carrying out this plan: to artificially create a world plague, and from the mass deaths caused by the world plague, to plunder the property of the people of all countries for the Wall Street tycoons.

Extremely appalling. This world-exterminating plague is being planned and implemented by a small group of Wall Street tycoons and the American government in the 20th century. If the people of all countries do not immediately take action to stop bacteriological warfare, then the rampant destructive forces will have no end, and the dark Middle Ages will be realized by the American imperialists. Can this be tolerated by civilized human beings in the twentieth century?

Before the advent of scientific civilization, mankind had encountered large-scale natural plagues. The Black Death, which spread throughout Europe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, took the lives of many people in Europe and created a Black Death terror that enveloped the entire Europe. The name of the Black Death made Europeans tremble. But since the development of scientific civilization—although its development is unsatisfactory and not universal under the private system—the Black Death and all natural plagues have been driven away. In our China, epidemics have disappeared since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The same is true in North Korea.

Unexpectedly, today the U.S. government, flattering the will of a small group of Wall Street tycoons, has become the artificial manufacturer of plagues throughout the world. In order to plunder the property and means of production of the people of all countries, they do not hesitate to artificially create plagues on a global scale, putting mankind in a desperate situation of death and causing mankind to suffer the terror of the Black Death again. This is something that no tyrant in the Middle Ages could do or even dream of, but today the American imperialists have become such a despicable culprit of the plague!

This is a great insult and provocation to scientific civilization! All scientists in the world who know how to safeguard scientific civilization should rise up in self-defense.

The masterminds behind American bacteriological warfare or biological warfare are inherently beastly fellows. Now, in order to be enemies of all mankind, they have expelled themselves from the ranks of humanity. They are now organizing, mobilizing, and directing the most disgusting plague insects and plague beasts to fight against mankind. They are already organizers, mobilizers, and commanders of groups of plague bacteria, plague insects, and plague animals. Groups of plague bacteria, plague insects, and plague animals are their armies and soldiers. Can anyone with even a little human feeling tolerate this insult? The American people should see that the U.S. government has become the organizer, protector, and spreader of plague bacteria, plague insects, and plague animals that endanger mankind, and do not feel a moral responsibility, and should not exert the necessary pressure on such an evil government? This is the right that the American people should have!

The U.S. government's conspiracy to deliberately spread plague bacteria is by no means accidental. Only the United States and Japan have not ratified the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, prohibiting the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons. As early as twenty-five years ago, the U.S. government had deliberately made itself an enemy of mankind and an enemy of scientific civilization, and had resolved to be the world's demon king. Today, the advocates of American bacteriological warfare deliberately pretend not to know that there are international conventions prohibiting bacteriological weapons, but only to deceive their own people, and to deliberately conceal the criminal determination of large-scale manufacturers of bacterial plagues who are enemies of mankind and scientific civilization.

For the safety of mankind, for the right of children to survive, for the normal development of scientific civilization, for the existence of sound human common sense, for the existence of the minimum moral standards of mankind, and for the sake of upholding the minimum justice of mankind, all mankind must stand up and fight to the end to eliminate American bacterial crimes, and must bring those criminals who use the most horrific and despicable bacteriological weapons to justice as war criminals.

Now is the time for humanity to rise up in self-defense. If humanity wants to avoid the bacterial plague spread by the American imperialists, if humanity wants to avoid the world-scale plague plan arranged by the American imperialists, it must rise up and fight to the end, and it must severely punish the American bacterial war criminals.

    拥护世界和平理事底紧急呼吁粉碎美国的细菌战
    何思敬
    世界和平理事会为“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书是一个维护人类安全和人类正义的紧急呼吁。
    现在是人类起来自卫的时候了。
    现在美国侵略者还能抵赖他们进行细菌战的滔天罪恶吗？他们当然不敢承认自己的罪恶，但任何诡辩能否定铁的事实吗？
    铁的事实是什么呢？
    在朝鲜战场上，在中国的境内，用飞机投下细菌炸弹，投下带菌昆虫和带菌动物以至带菌腐肉死鱼等等丑恶事实，已被公正的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的实地调查所证实了。
    被俘的美国和英国底士兵，也提供了美国进行细菌战的证据。侵略者对其士兵注射了“秘密防疫针”已不是一两个俘虏底口供了。我们还知道了美军中还有使用美制细菌炮弹的美国新闻电影。
    还有，美国众议院拨款小组委员会公布的一个材料，证明了美国陆军部计划进一步扩展生物战（细菌战）的准备工作，这就是美国陆军化学兵团司令布伦少将在三月三日所作的证言，这证言是经过了严格检查的。
    这最后一个证据说明了美国侵略者正计划着扩大他们的滔天罪恶到全世界。
    美国侵略者之所以犯这种滔天罪恶有他们丧尽天良的强盗理由。今年一月底，美国陆军化学兵团研究部长克利西竟公开地说：细菌武器可以使他们“能够花最少的代价削弱敌人的抵抗力，从而取得胜利”。他还说：如果人害病死了，工厂和房子就会原封不动地落在战胜者的手中。今年三月五日，美国国防部化学兵团长伯伦少将在“国会文摘”中主张无限制地使用细菌武器。
    再明显不过了，美国侵略者是计划着、并已经进行着这个计划：用人工来制造世界瘟疫，并从世界瘟疫所引起的大量死亡中，替华尔街富豪们掠夺全世界各国人民底财产。
    骇人听闻之极了。这种灭绝人类的世界瘟疫竟被二十世纪一小撮华尔街豪富们和美国政府所计划和实行着，如果各国人民不立即行动起来制止细菌战，那么破坏力量底猖獗将没有止境，黑暗的中世纪将被美帝国主义者所实现。这能令二十世纪底文明人类容忍吗？
    在科学文明未出现以前，人类曾遭遇过大规模的天然瘟疫。十四五世纪蔓延于全欧洲的黑死病曾夺去了欧洲许多人的生命，造成了笼罩全欧洲的黑死病恐怖，黑死病底名字使欧洲人战栗。但科学文明发展以来——尽管它在私有制度之下发展得不能令人满意、不普及——但黑死病和一切天然瘟疫被驱逐了。在我们中国，自中华人民共和国成立以来，瘟疫已经绝迹。在北朝鲜，也是如此。
    不料今天美国政府奉承了一小撮华尔街富豪们底意志竟成了全世界瘟疫底人工制造者，他们为了掠夺各国人民底财产和生产条件，竟不惜在全世界范围内人工制造瘟疫，置人类于死亡底绝境，使人类重遭黑死病底恐怖，使黑死病底恐怖笼罩全世界，而这是中世纪底任何暴君所不能做到、也不可能梦想的，但今天美帝国主义者竟做了这样令人唾弃的瘟疫底罪魁祸首！
    这是对科学文明莫大的侮辱和挑衅啊！全世界一切懂得维护科学文明的科学家们应当起来自卫了。
    美国细菌战或生物战底罪魁祸首们本是人面兽心的家伙，现在为了和全人类为敌之故，把自己从人籍中开除了。他们现在组织着、动员着并指挥着最令人厌恶的瘟疫虫类、瘟疫兽类来和人类作战，他们已是一群又一群瘟疫细菌、瘟疫虫类、瘟疫动物底组织者、动员者、指挥者了。一群又一群的瘟疫细菌、瘟疫虫豸、瘟疫动物是他们底军队和士兵了。只要稍微有一点人的感觉，能容忍这个侮辱吗？美国人民应当看看美国政府做了危害人类的瘟疫细菌、瘟疫昆虫、瘟疫动物底组织者、保护者和散布者而不感到道义的责任、而不应当对这样一个万恶政府施以必要的压力吗？这是美国人民应有的权利啊！
    美国政府有计划地散布瘟疫细菌的阴谋决不是偶然的。只有美国和日本没有批准一九二五年六月十七日禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。早在二十五年前，美国政府已蓄意与人类为敌，与科学文明为敌，已决心做世界底混世魔王了。今天，美国细菌战底拥护者们故意装作不知道世界上有禁止细菌武器的国际公约，只不过是图谋欺骗其本国人民，而替细菌瘟疫底大规模制造者蓄意与人类为敌与科学文明为敌的犯罪决心进行掩饰而已。
    为了人类底安全，为了儿童生存底权利，为了科学文明底正常发展，为了人类健全常识之存在，为了人类起码的道德水准之存在，为了伸张人类起码的正义，全人类必须站起来为消灭美国细菌犯罪而奋斗到底，必须把那些使用最骇人听闻、最令人唾弃的细菌武器的罪犯们作为战犯归案法办。
    现在是人类起来自卫的时候了。人类若要免于美帝国主义者所进行散布的细菌瘟疫，人类若要免于美帝国主义者所布置的世界规模底瘟疫计划，必须起来奋斗到底，必须严惩美国细菌战犯。
