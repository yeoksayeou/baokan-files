    Hebei Changping County Should Inspect Drought Prevention Work
    Editor: Recently, I was passing through Langgezhuang in the Fifth District of Changping County, Hebei Province, and saw several newly dug earthen wells along the roadside and ditch edges of this village. The earthen wells were five or six feet deep, containing only two or three dan of muddy water. At that moment, some farmers were working in the fields, so I asked them what those newly dug earthen wells were for. They said, "The government called for drought prevention, and the cadres told us to dig them." I saw that they didn't understand the benefits of digging wells for themselves, so I talked to them about the significance of the People's Government's call for drought prevention and resistance. Unexpectedly, they said, "Can human power overcome the heavens! This is just a waste of effort." Some even said, "Rain from the sky is vertical water, while water poured by human effort is horizontal water, and irrigating with horizontal water won't grow good crops." Some farmers were digging wells merely as a formality to deal with the task assigned by the authorities. Therefore, I believe that the Changping County People's Government and the cadres in charge of this work should inspect the drought prevention work and should more widely and deeply conduct ideological education among the farmers, criticize the "relying on heaven for food" mentality of some farmers, and mobilize them to earnestly prevent and resist drought.　Ju Changxi

    河北昌平县应检查防旱工作
    编辑同志：最近我有事路经河北省昌平县五区兰各庄时，见到这村道边、沟沿的几眼新挖的土井；土井有五、六尺深，里面只有二、三担混水。这时恰好有几个农民在地里作活，我就问他们那些新挖的土井是干什么用的。他们说：“政府号召防旱，干部让挖的。”我看他们还不了解挖井对自己的好处，就向他们谈了些人民政府号召防旱抗旱的意义，不料他们竟说：“凭人力还能抗过天！这就叫白费劲。”有的还说什么“天上下雨是立水，人力浇水却是横水，浇横水不会长好庄稼。”部分农民打井只是形式主义地应付公事。因此，我认为昌平县人民政府和主管这一工作的干部应检查一下防旱工作，并应该更普遍地更深入地对农民进行思想教育，批判部分农民的“靠天吃饭”思想，动员他们认真防旱抗旱。　居长喜
