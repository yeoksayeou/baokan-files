    Untimely Loan Disbursement of Spring Wheat Seeds in Nanpi County

    Editor: On March 9th, Nanpi County, Shandong Province, transported 20,000 jin of spring wheat seeds from the Dezhou Prefecture. This batch of wheat seeds was allocated by the Central People's Government from relief grain, intended for loaning to the masses in disaster areas for spring planting. However, apart from Yang Baozhong, a farmer from Chaizhuang Village, Sunzhuang Township, Fifth District, who borrowed 105 jin of wheat seeds on March 20th, the remaining 19,800+ jin of wheat seeds are still stored in the Nanpi County Farm, not yet distributed. The reason for the untimely distribution of wheat seeds is that the responsible cadres of the county abandoned leadership in this work. Zhang Yong, the head of the Construction Section of Nanpi County, assigned the work of loaning wheat seeds to a staff member surnamed Sun, and went to work in the Sixth District himself. Staff member Sun did not pay attention to this work. Although the staff member sent by the Prefecture made several suggestions to him, he still did not distribute the wheat seeds. The work of loaning wheat seeds was thus delayed. I believe that although this batch of wheat seeds arrived in the county relatively late, if time had been seized, it could still have been distributed in a timely manner. I suggest that the county conduct a serious inspection of this work in order to make practical improvements in future work.

    南皮县春麦种籽没有及时贷放
    编辑同志：三月九日，山东省南皮县从德州专署运来春麦种两万斤。这批麦种是中央人民政府从救济粮内拨出，准备贷给灾区群众作春播用的。但除五区孙庄乡柴庄村农民杨宝忠在三月二十日贷到一百零五斤麦种外，其余一万九千八百多斤麦种，还搁在南皮县农场里，没有贷放下去。麦种没有及时贷放下去的原因，是县的负责干部对这一工作放弃了领导。南皮县建设科长张勇同志把贷放麦种的工作布置给一位姓孙的科员，自己就到六区工作去了。孙科员没有重视这一工作。虽然专署派来的工作人员向他提了几次意见，他仍然没有把麦种发下。贷麦种工作就这样耽误了。我认为这批麦种虽然到县较晚，但如抓紧时间，还是可以及时发下去的。我建议该县对这一工作认真进行检查，以便在今后的工作中切实加以改进。宋意
