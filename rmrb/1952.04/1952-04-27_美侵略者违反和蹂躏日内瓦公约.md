The U.S. aggressors, in order to cover up their absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation" and their crimes of persecuting and massacring our captured personnel in every possible way, shamelessly pose as "strict observers" of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, to confuse the world's people. On March 16th of this year, Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, said to a reporter from the Stars and Stripes, "We strictly abide by the rules of the Geneva Convention." However, the paradoxical attitude taken by the U.S. aggressors on the issue of prisoner repatriation during the armistice negotiations, and the bloody facts of their brutal and inhumane persecution and massacre of our captured personnel, completely expose the lies of the American swindlers, demonstrating that the U.S. aggressors have violated and trampled upon the Geneva Convention that the U.S. government itself signed.

The Geneva Convention, which the U.S. aggressors claim to "strictly abide by," explicitly prohibits the detention of prisoners after the cessation of hostilities. Article 118 of the Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 7 also stipulates: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce the rights secured to them by the present Convention." The absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" insisted upon by the U.S. side from the beginning is clearly in complete contradiction with these provisions. Regarding this point, even the U.S. aggressors' puppet states are timidly reminding the U.S. to pay attention. According to a British "Foreign Report" dispatch on April 3rd, Britain has raised "objections" to the United States' opposition to the complete repatriation of captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides, one of the reasons being: "The United Nations has declared that in the Korean War, they support the Geneva Convention. Refusing to repatriate all prisoners could be interpreted as a violation of the Convention. The relevant provisions in the Geneva Convention in effect state that prisoners of war may not be deprived of the rights they enjoy under the Convention. One of these rights is repatriation." In addition to Britain, "Canada and possibly other countries" have also expressed similar opinions.

Secondly, Article 13 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated," and the same article and Article 3 explicitly stipulate that prisoners of war must be protected from ill-treatment, intimidation, insults, or damage to their bodies. However, the inhumane treatment of our captured personnel by the U.S. aggressors is also a complete violation of the Geneva Convention that they themselves signed. The prisoner-of-war camps set up by the U.S. invading army in southern Korea are dark and dismal hells on earth. A United Press reporter's dispatch on January 21st from the U.S. First Prisoner-of-War Camp on Koje Island revealed that the "concentration camp center on Koje Island has become an island of terror," "riots, torture, and assassinations are interwoven into a horrific picture in the daily lives of the prisoners here." The heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressors in mistreating and slaughtering our captured personnel are countless. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in 1951 alone, nearly 17,000 of our captured personnel were mistreated and murdered. This year, in the two tragic incidents on Koje Island alone, the U.S. aggressors barbarously killed 252 of our captured personnel.

Thirdly, Article 13 of the Geneva Convention also specifically stipulates: "No kind of bodily injury or medical or scientific experiments which are not indicated by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest shall be performed on him." Despite this, the U.S. aggressors inhumanely used our captured personnel for bacteriological experiments on U.S. Landing Craft No. 1091. According to the Associated Press, as a result of the experiments, "of the more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners held," "1,400 are very sick, and about 80 percent of the rest have some kind of disease."

Finally, the U.S. aggressors, disregarding the provisions of the aforementioned Geneva Convention clauses and also disregarding the following provisions of Article 14, namely: "Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour," actually instructed Chiang Kai-shek and Li Seung-man gang secret agents to forcibly tattoo characters on our captured personnel, force them to write blood letters, and participate in organizations such as the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps." The U.S. aggressors attempt to use these brutal means, which violate the Geneva Convention, to achieve their despicable goal of detaining our captured personnel. To achieve this goal, the U.S. aggressors are also intensifying their "screening" of our captured personnel, forcibly "reclassifying" them. Even the U.S. chief representative, Joy, cannot conceal the fact that this measure violates the Geneva Convention. On April 9th, a Reuters reporter asked Joy at the U.S. military base camp in Munsan, Korea: "What clauses in international law stipulate that we must identify those among the prisoners we are detaining who were forcibly conscripted into the army by North Korea? Are these personnel eligible for reclassification?" Joy replied: "There are no clauses in the Geneva Convention that stipulate that people who were forcibly conscripted into the army must be identified." It is perfectly clear that the U.S. aggressors' forced "screening" of our captured personnel has no legal basis whatsoever.

From this, it can be seen that the truth about the U.S. aggressors' claim of "strictly abiding by the Geneva Convention" is: mistreating, insulting, and collectively massacring our captured personnel, and plotting to forcibly detain them under the pretext of "voluntary repatriation" and hand them over to the clutches of the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Seung-man gangs. All of this is a violation of the Geneva Convention, which the U.S. side constantly cites.

On the other hand, our side adopts a humane and lenient policy towards all prisoners of war. We do not beat, scold, kill, or insult the dignity of prisoners of war. Even under the most difficult supply conditions, we give prisoners of war the same food as the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, and we provide treatment to wounded and sick prisoners of war. Our policy of lenient treatment of prisoners has been unanimously praised by world opinion and by the captured personnel of the U.S. military and its puppet armies held by our side. At the armistice negotiation table, our side has consistently worked to implement the reasonable principle of repatriating all prisoners of war on both sides. Our side reasonably and fairly maintains that after the cessation of active hostilities, both sides should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by them, ensure that all captured personnel are reunited with their families after repatriation, including prisoners of war from northern Korea held by our side and prisoners of war from southern Korea held by the U.S. side who are repatriated to their respective hometowns to resume peaceful lives. At the same time, in order to take care of the desire of prisoners of war on both sides to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families and resume peaceful lives, our side reasonably proposes that prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army who are originally from South Korea and prisoners of war from the Li Seung-man puppet army who are originally from North Korea may not be repatriated if they wish to remain in their respective hometowns and live peaceful lives. These fair and reasonable proposals and the policy of lenient treatment of prisoners by our side not only fully comply with the spirit of humanitarianism and the wishes of the people of the world and the families of prisoners of war, but also fully comply with the principles of the Geneva Convention.

The facts are very clear that the U.S. aggressors, who claim to be "strict observers of the Geneva Convention," are precisely the thorough destroyers and violators of the Geneva Convention. The unreasonable demand of "voluntary repatriation" stubbornly insisted upon by the U.S. aggressors is full of loopholes and can no longer be justified. At present, the only feasible way to resolve the fourth item on the agenda is that the U.S. side should immediately abandon its absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation," which violates the Geneva Convention, and reach an agreement based on our side's fair and reasonable proposals. Otherwise, the U.S. side must bear the serious responsibility for all delays and even the destruction of the armistice negotiations.

### 美侵略者违反和蹂躏日内瓦公约

    美侵略者违反和蹂躏日内瓦公约
    美国侵略者为了掩盖它“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张及百般迫害与虐杀我方被俘人员的罪行，经常无耻地以一九四九年八月十二日关于对战俘的待遇的日内瓦公约的“严格遵守者”自居，以混淆世界人民的视听。今年三月十六日，侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特曾向星条报记者说：“我们严格遵守日内瓦公约的规则”。但是，美国侵略者在停战谈判中对遣俘问题上所采取的悖谬态度，及其残暴不仁地迫害和虐杀我方被俘人员的血腥事实，完全戳穿了美国骗子们的谎言，说明美国侵略者违反了和蹂躏了美国政府自己签过字的日内瓦公约。
    美国侵略者所口口声声说“严格遵守”的日内瓦公约，首先就明白规定禁止在停战后扣留俘虏。该公约第一百十八条规定：“积极敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”第七条又规定：“不论在任何情况下，战俘不能声明放弃本公约所赋与的权利。”而美方自始坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，显然是与这些规定完全相抵触的。关于这一点，甚至美国侵略者的仆从国家也心虚地在提醒美国注意了。据四月三日英国“外事报道”消息，英国对于美国反对全部遣返朝中方面被俘人员已提出“诘难”，理由之一是：“联合国已经宣布，在朝鲜战争中，他们拥护日内瓦公约。而拒绝遣返一切俘虏之举可能被解释成为破坏公约。日内瓦公约中有关的条文实际上认为：战俘依该公约规定所享受的权利不得予以剥夺。这些权利之一便是遣返。”除了英国以外，“加拿大还可能有别的国家”也都表示过类似的意见。
    其次，日内瓦公约第十三条规定：“战俘不论何时必须受人道的待遇”，同条和第三条并明确规定要保护战俘不受虐待、威胁、侮辱或毁伤他们的身体。但是，美国侵略者对待我方被俘人员的非人道待遇，同样完全违反了它们自己签过字的日内瓦公约。美国侵略军队设在朝鲜南部的俘虏营乃是暗无天日的人间地狱。合众社记者一月二十一日发自巨济岛美方第一俘虏营的电讯透露，巨济岛的“集中营中心变成了一个恐怖之岛”，“暴乱、酷刑、暗杀在这里的俘虏日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。美国侵略者虐待和屠杀我方被俘人员的滔天罪行是数说不尽的。据极不完全的统计，仅在一九五一年，被虐杀的我方被俘人员就将近一万七千人。在今年，仅巨济岛两次惨案，美国侵略者就野蛮地杀害了我方被俘人员二百五十二人。
    再次，日内瓦公约第十三条并特别规定：“任何种类的身体毁伤或医疗的或科学的试验，如非有关战俘在医疗、牙科或住院方面的治疗所应需，并为其本人的利益者，均不得施用于该战俘”。尽管如此，美国侵略者竟然在美军第一○九一号登陆艇上绝灭人性地用我方被俘人员作细菌试验。据美联社透露，试验的结果，“关着十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏”中，“有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病”。
    最后，美国侵略者不顾上述日内瓦公约条款的规定，也不顾第十四条的下列规定，即：“战俘在任何情况下享有尊重其人格和荣誉之权利”，竟指使蒋李匪帮特务分子，强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺字，强制他们写血书和参加所谓“反共救国团”之类的组织。美国侵略者妄图利用这些违反日内瓦公约的残暴手段，达到它扣留我方被俘人员的卑鄙目的。为了达到这个目的，美国侵略者并在加紧对我方被俘人员进行“甄别”，硬把他们“重新分类”。这一措施是违反日内瓦公约的这一事实，甚至美方首席代表乔埃都无法掩饰。路透社记者于四月九日在汶山侵朝美军基地行营问乔埃说：“国际法中有什么条款规定要查明在我们拘留的俘虏中有那些人被北朝鲜强迫征入军队中？这些人员有资格被重新分类吗？”乔埃答道：“日内瓦公约中没有什么条款规定要查明被强迫征入军队的人们。”美国侵略者强行“甄别”我方被俘人员之没有任何法理根据，是再明显也没有的事情了。
    由此可见，美国侵略者口中的“严格遵守日内瓦公约”的真相就是：虐待、侮辱和集体屠杀我方被俘人员，并阴谋以“自愿遣返”为藉口，强迫扣留他们，送交蒋李匪帮的魔掌中。而这一切都是破坏美方自己不断引用的日内瓦公约的。
    另一方面，我方则对一切战俘采取人道的宽大政策。对战俘不打、不骂、不杀、不侮辱人格。即使在供给最困难的情形下，也给战俘以与朝中人民军队同样的食物，并给伤、病战俘以治疗。我方这种宽待俘虏政策，已为世界舆论和被我方收容的美军及其仆从军队的被俘人员所一致赞扬。在停战谈判会议桌上，我方始终不渝地为贯彻遣返双方全部战俘的合理原则而努力。我方合情合理地主张：在积极的敌对行为停止后，交战双方应迅速地释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘，保证全部被俘人员在遣返后与其家人团聚，包括被我方收容的籍贯朝鲜北部的战俘和美方收容的籍贯朝鲜南部的战俘各自被遣回故乡，重度和平生活。同时，为了照顾双方战俘迫切返回故乡与家人团聚和重度和平生活的意愿，我方并合理地主张原籍南朝鲜的朝鲜人民军和原籍北朝鲜的李伪军的俘虏，如果愿意留在他们各自的家乡过和平生活，可以不予遣返。我方在遣返问题上的这些公平合理的主张和宽待俘虏的政策，不仅完全符合人道主义的精神及世界人民与战俘的家人的愿望，而且也完全符合于日内瓦公约的原则。
    事实已经十分明白，以所谓“严格遵守日内瓦公约”自居的美国侵略者，正是日内瓦公约的彻底破坏者和违反者。美国侵略者顽固坚持的“自愿遣返”的无理主张，已是千孔百疮，再也无法自圆其说了。目前，解决第四项议程的唯一可行的道路就是：美方应该立即放弃其破坏日内瓦公约的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，并以我方的公平合理的建议为基础，达成协议，否则，美方必须担负一切拖延以至破坏停战谈判的严重责任。
