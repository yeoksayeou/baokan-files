Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 20th: The dismissal of Brandweiner, a member of the World Peace Council, from his position as a professor at the University of Graz has aroused widespread anger among the Austrian people.

    The Austrian reactionaries launched an attack on Professor Brandweiner several months ago. After Professor Brandweiner delivered a report on the militarization of western Austria at the Salzburg Conference of the Austrian Peace Council, Austrian Interior Minister Graf openly threatened him in the newspaper.
    This Austrian scientist, as the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, had been to Korea and China and confirmed that the American aggressors were conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare against the peace-loving people of Korea and China. Since then, the persecution of Brandweiner has intensified. The American-run "Vienna Courier" first issued the tune of political persecution, and the Austrian reactionary newspaper "Die Presse" and others blatantly stated that now is the time to persecute Professor Brandweiner using the methods of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation against peace fighters.
    Obviously, the Austrian reactionaries are using the methods of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Austrian People's Party organ "Neues Wiener Tagblatt" even said that Professor Brandweiner's investigation into American atrocities in Korea damaged Austria's reputation overseas, and first suggested that he be dismissed from his position. Newspapers of other parties in the Austrian government also published the same argument to curry favor with Washington.
    However, democratic newspapers, expressing the voice of all honest Austrians, strongly protested against the reactionaries' persecution of Brandweiner. "Arbeiter-Zeitung" pointed out that the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner without the consent of the University of Graz Senate once again proves that the Americans are more afraid of exposing the truth about their inhuman war in Korea than they are of the plague they are spreading there on a large scale. The newspaper said that the Austrian government's Ministry of Education's dismissal of Professor Brandweiner is tantamount to publicly declaring that it is an accomplice of those who are massacring humanity on a large scale. "Volksstimme" pointed out that the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner is entirely an act of American retaliation. This incident also exposes the true colors of the Austrian government in front of the people of the world: they are accomplices of those who are waging bacteriological warfare.

    奥地利人民抗议奥反动派迫害布兰德魏纳
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社维也纳十九日讯：世界和平理事会理事布兰德魏纳被解除格拉茨大学教授的职位一事，激起了广大的奥地利人民群众的愤怒。
    几个月前，奥地利反动派就对布兰德魏纳教授发动了进攻。当布兰德魏纳教授在奥地利和平理事会萨尔斯堡会议上作了关于奥地利西部军国主义化的报告以后，奥地利内政部长葛拉夫就曾在报纸上公开恐吓他。
    这位奥地利科学家曾以国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长的身份到过朝鲜和中国，证实了美国侵略者正在对爱好和平的朝鲜和中国人民进行大规模的细菌战。从此，对布兰德魏纳的迫害就变本加厉起来。美国人主办的“维也纳快报”首先发出了政治迫害的论调，奥地利的反动报纸“新闻报”等更明目张胆地表示：现在正是采取美国联邦调查局对付和平战士的手段来迫害布兰德魏纳教授的时候。
    显然，奥地利反动派是在采用美国联邦调查局的办法。奥地利人民党机关报“新维也纳日报”竟说布兰德魏纳教授调查美国在朝鲜的暴行，损害了奥地利在海外的声誉；首先建议解除他的职位。奥地利政府其他党派的报纸也登出同样的论调，来博取华盛顿的欢心。
    但是，表达一切正直的奥地利人的心声的民主报纸，都猛烈抗议反动派对布兰德魏纳的迫害。“晚报”指出：不征得格拉茨大学校务会议的同意，就解除布兰德魏纳教授的职位一事，又一次证明了美国人害怕暴露他们在朝鲜进行的非人道战争的真相，甚于害怕他们正在那里大规模传播的瘟疫。该报说：奥地利政府教育部解除布兰德魏纳教授的职务，等于公开宣布它是那些正在大规模屠杀人类的家伙的同谋者。“奥地利人民之声报”指出：解除布兰德魏纳教授的职位一事完全是美国的报复行为。这事也使奥地利政府在全世界人民的面前原形毕露：它们是那些进行细菌战的人们的帮凶。
