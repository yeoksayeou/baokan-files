    Textbook Compilers Should Emphasize Textbook Content
    Comrade Editor: To imbue political thought into language teaching materials is one of the important tasks of every language textbook compiler. However, after recently reading Ling Weimin's compiled "Elementary Russian Reader" Volume 1 (first published by Zhonghua Book Company in April 1951), we found many serious shortcomings and errors in it.
    For example, the content of the third lesson is about a father who, in order to encourage his son to get up early, tells him a story about a person who found money on the street because he got up early. Is getting up early not for the benefit of one's health so as to better serve the people, but rather to obtain unearned money? The content of the thirteenth lesson is about a poor man who is very happy in his poor life, but after receiving a large sum of money from a rich man, he feels extremely distressed. This is a deceptive statement by the ruling class in the old society to make the poor content with poverty. The fourth lesson also features Shanghai's "Avenue Joffre" and "Avenue Foch," named after imperialist aggressors. These road names have long been abolished by the people, but this book still uses them, which is obviously also extremely wrong.
    In short, we believe that the material selection for the first volume of "Elementary Russian Reader" is flawed. We hope that the compiler and publisher of this book will pay attention to correcting it. Wang Zhitai, Wen Daixiang

### 语文读本的编译者应重视读本内容

    语文读本的编译者应重视读本内容
    编辑同志：把政治思想贯注到语文教材中去，这是每个语文读本编撰者的重要任务之一。但最近我们读了凌渭民编译的“初级俄文选读”第一集（中华书局一九五一年四月初版）时，却发现其中有不少严重的缺点和错误。
    例如，该书第三课的内容，是一个做父亲的，为了鼓励他的儿子早起，就给他讲述一个人因早起而在街上拾到钱的故事。难道早起不是为了有益身体，以更好地为人民服务，而是为了获取不劳而获的金钱吗？第十三课的内容，是说一个穷人处在贫苦的生活中非常快乐，但在得到一个富人赠予的大笔金钱后，却感到不胜苦恼了。这是旧社会里的统治阶级要穷人安于贫困的一种欺骗人的说法。在第四课中还出现有以帝国主义侵略者的名字为名的上海的“霞飞路”和“福煦路”。这些路名早已为人民废除，而这本书却依然采用，显然也是极其错误的。
    总之，我们认为“初级俄文选读”第一集的取材是有错误的。希望这本书的编译者和出版者注意纠正。王之泰  温代祥
