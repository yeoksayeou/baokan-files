    To the Editor: After reading the article "Waste Products File a Complaint," written by Hong Guanglie and published on page three of the People's Daily on March 7th, the employees of our Fengfeng Mining Bureau unanimously agreed that it was a powerful and rational suggestion to urge leading cadres to quickly correct bureaucratic errors and properly handle waste products. However, more than a month has passed since the publication of this article, and the leading cadres of our mine still treat this correct suggestion with "indifference" and "disregard," and the waste products have still not been processed. Now, locomotives, rails, and various machines are still exposed to wind and rain, unattended, and unable to play their due role in production. I suggest that the leading cadres stop engaging in bureaucratism and expedite the handling of the waste product issue.

    峰峰矿务局领导干部应尽速处理废品纠正官僚主义
    编辑同志：人民日报三月七日第三版发表了洪光烈写的“废品告状”一文，我们峰峰矿务局职工看了以后，一致认为这是促使领导干部迅速纠正官僚主义错误、很好地处理废品的一个强有力的合理化建议。但是，这篇文章发表以来已经一月多了，我矿领导干部仍以“熟视无睹”“置若罔闻”的态度对待这个正确的建议，对废品仍然没有处理。现在，火车头、铁轨等各种机器，依然遭受着雨淋日晒，无人照管，不能在生产中起应有的作用。我建议领导干部不要再耍官僚主义，尽速处理废品问题。
