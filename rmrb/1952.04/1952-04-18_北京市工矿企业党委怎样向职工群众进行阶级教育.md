    How the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party for Industrial and Mining Enterprises Conducts Class Education for Workers and Staff
    Baolun, Peng Jing
    As the "Anti-Tiger" struggle in Beijing's industrial and mining enterprises came to a close, most units seized the time to conduct relatively systematic class education for the broad masses of workers and staff. This was to enable workers and staff to understand the great significance of opposing the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements from the perspective of class struggle. Units that carried out this education generally discussed the following issues: (1) the nature and dual character of the Chinese national bourgeoisie; (2) the rampant attacks launched by illegal bourgeois elements against the working class in the past three years and their harmfulness; (3) the essence of the "Three-Anti" movement. As of April 5th, eleven industrial and mining enterprise units had given large lectures to workers and staff, five factory and enterprise units had given lectures to Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and activists in propaganda work, and the remaining seven factory and enterprise units, although they did not specifically give large lectures to workers and staff, generally carried out class education. Some units are preparing to give large lectures.

    In order to make various theoretical issues easier for workers and staff to understand, each unit used examples from its own factory as teaching materials when conducting education. For example, the Party Committee of the Mentougou Coal Mine seized upon the case of the unscrupulous merchant Li Chengzhi, who used various methods to corrupt twelve cadres of the mine and embezzle state funds for speculation and profiteering, as teaching material. The General Branch Committee of the Party of the Beijing Machine Factory used the example of the illegal capitalist of the Daxing Iron Factory corrupting Deng Yuxiang, a foreman of the Beijing Machine Factory, to make everyone aware of the vicious means of illegal capitalists. Originally, the Daxing Iron Factory only had one iron factory, but in recent years, due to a large amount of theft of state assets, the factory now has a capital of 3.4 billion. These real people and real events are the most powerful materials for conducting this class education. Through these materials, workers and staff realized that illegal bourgeois elements have been eroding the working class at all times in the past three years; and they have a clearer understanding of the nature and dual character of the bourgeoisie in the new democratic society.

    Many units have also used other methods to educate workers and staff after the lectures, which has made the workers and staff's understanding of the lecture content more specific. The General Branch of the Electric Power Bureau organized small-scale forums, where some workers who had worked in private enterprises and shops accused illegal capitalists of cruelly exploiting workers by using vicious illegal means. The 546 Factory used three or four hundred words in the "Tiger Fighting Bulletin" issued daily to explain the issue of class struggle, from which the workers obtained regular learning and propaganda materials. After the Party General Branch of the Automobile Company gave lectures, it led all the employees of the company to conduct personal ideological summaries. During the summary, everyone used the method of criticism and self-criticism to carefully examine and criticize the influence of bourgeois ideology on themselves. Individual workers who fantasized about getting rich and trying to become capitalists resolutely expressed their determination to break ties with bourgeois ideology and stand firmly on the working class's position after the ideological summary. After giving lectures to workers and staff, the Party Committee of the People's Printing Factory also gave supplementary lectures to propagandists and activists in propaganda work, and printed propaganda outlines, key points and other reference materials for them to help them learn and carry out propaganda. The Electric Power Bureau stipulates that propagandists should be given a "small class" once a week. Every two weeks, the "Tiger Fighting" captain gives a "small class" to the "Tiger Fighting" team members. The propaganda work of many factories has paid attention to mastering rich materials and adopting novel methods, and all have clear class characteristics.

    After this class education, the class consciousness of the workers and staff has been greatly improved. They have recognized the nature of the bourgeoisie and drawn a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie. Many workers in the 546 Factory said: "The purpose of the rampant attack by illegal capitalists is to seize our leadership and destroy our revolutionary construction. We must draw a clear line, be vigilant against them, and make sure they have no loopholes to exploit." An old worker from the Electric Power Bureau said: "Our cooperation with the bourgeoisie will still last for a long time, so we must be vigilant at all times!"

    The entire "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggle is an extremely vivid and powerful class education for the working class; it is completely necessary and appropriate to extract certain cadres to conduct a relatively systematic education for the workers and staff at a certain stage of the actual struggle. This can not only improve the workers and staff's understanding, but also has great significance for in-depth mobilization of the masses and further promotion of the movement. Facts have proved that conducting systematic class education for workers and staff in combination with actual struggles is easier to achieve greater results. Because the masses have a lot of practical experience in the struggle, and at the same time, there are rich teaching materials in the struggle, which are very favorable conditions for conducting education.

    Finally, it should be pointed out that the class education carried out by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party for Industrial and Mining Enterprises among workers and staff this time is not without flaws. Some units did not make serious preparations before the lectures, and made inappropriate or incorrect explanations on some issues, such as completely obliterating the certain positive aspects of the bourgeoisie in the new democratic stage. This is worthy of special attention in future propaganda and education work.

    北京市工矿企业党委怎样向职工群众进行阶级教育
    宝伦　彭静
    北京市工矿企业各单位在“打虎”斗争告一段落时，一般地都抓紧时间对广大职工群众进行了比较系统的阶级教育。使职工群众从阶级斗争的观点上来认识反对不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻的重大意义。凡是进行了这种教育的单位，一般地都讲述了以下的几个问题：（一）中国民族资产阶级的本质和它的两面性。（二）三年来不法资产阶级分子对工人阶级举行的猖狂进攻及其危害性。（三）“三反”运动的实质。至四月五日为止，已有十一个工矿企业单位对职工群众上过大课，有五个工厂企业单位对党员、团员、宣传员、宣传工作中的积极分子上过课，其余七个工厂企业单位虽然没有专门给职工群众上大课，但一般地也都进行了阶级教育。有的单位，正准备上大课。
    为使各种理论问题可以比较容易地被职工群众所领会，在具体进行教育时，各单位都采用本厂的实例做教材。如门头沟煤矿党委抓住了奸商李承志曾用各种办法拉本矿十二个干部下水，盗取国家资金进行投机倒把的事例，做为教材。北京机器厂党的总支委员会，用大兴铁工厂的不法资本家腐蚀北京机器厂工长邓玉祥的例子，使大家认识了违法资本家的毒辣手段。本来大兴铁厂只有一个铁厂子，几年来由于大量盗窃国家资财，该厂已拥有三十四亿的资本。这些真人真事是进行这次阶级教育时最有力量的材料。通过这些材料，使职工群众认识到三年来不法资产阶级分子无时不在侵蚀着工人阶级；对于在新民主主义社会中的资产阶级的本质及其两面性有了较清楚的认识。
    很多单位在讲课之后，又都用其他办法向职工群众进行了教育，这就使职工群众对讲课内容的了解更加具体。电业局总支曾组织了小型座谈会，会上有些曾在私营企业，商店中做过活的工人，控诉了不法资本家怎样用恶毒的违法手段残酷地压榨工人。五四六工厂在每日印发的“打虎战报”上，都用三四百字的篇幅解释关于阶级斗争的问题，工人们由此获得经常的学习材料和宣传资料。汽车公司党总支讲课之后，领导全公司职工进行了个人思想总结。总结时，每个人都用批评和自我批评的方法，详细地检查和批判了资产阶级思想对自己的影响。个别幻想发财，企图当资本家的职工，在思想总结之后，坚决表示要和资产阶级思想斩断联系，站稳工人阶级立场。人民印刷厂党委会在给职工讲课之后，还给宣传员、宣传工作积极分子讲了补助课，并印了宣传提纲、要点等参考资料发给他们，以帮助他们学习和进行宣传。电业局规定每周给宣传员上一次“小课”。每两周“打虎”队长给“打虎”队员上一次“小课”。很多工厂的宣传工作都注意了掌握丰富的材料，采取新颖的方法，都有着明确的阶级性。
    经过这次阶级教育，职工群众的阶级觉悟大大提高了一步。他们认清了资产阶级的本质，划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的界限。五四六工厂的很多工人说：“不法资本家猖狂进攻的目的就是要夺取我们的领导权，就是要破坏我们的革命建设，我们要划清界限，对它提高警惕，使它没有空子可钻。”电业局有一个老工友说：“咱们和资产阶级的合作，还有一个很长的时间，可得随时警惕啊！”
    整个的“三反”“五反”斗争是对工人阶级极其生动有力的阶级教育；在实际斗争进展到一定阶段，抽出一定的干部，向职工群众进行一次比较系统的教育是完全必要的，应该的，这不仅能够提高职工群众的认识，而且对深入发动群众，进一步推动运动都有很大的意义。事实证明，结合实际斗争对职工群众进行系统的阶级教育是容易取得更大的成果的。因为群众在斗争中有了很多实际的体验，同时，斗争中又有丰富的教材，这都是进行教育的非常有利的条件。
    最后，应当提出：这次北京市工矿企业党委在职工中所进行的阶级教育并不是毫无缺陷的。有的单位因讲课之前未做认真的准备，对有些问题做了不适当的或者是错误的解释，例如完全抹煞了资产阶级在新民主主义阶段中所具有的一定的积极性。这是值得今后在宣传教育工作中特别注意的。
