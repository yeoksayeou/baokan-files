Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 6th. The Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee recently held an expanded meeting for confession and accusation, exposing the crimes of He Hengfu, the director of the committee and a major unscrupulous merchant, in endangering the country. The meeting was attended by all members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee and representatives of industrial and commercial households who had already reached conclusions in various industries. Representatives of employees of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, representatives of employees in the import and export industry, representatives of democratic parties, members of the study committee of the Municipal Consultative Committee, and representatives of people from all walks of life, totaling more than 300 people, were invited to participate.

Hua Yuqing, Executive Chairman of the meeting and Deputy Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, announced the opening of the meeting and briefly reported on the crimes of the major unscrupulous merchant He Hengfu. Then, Wei Jinfei, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Joint Anti-Corruption Inspection Committee, conveyed on the spot the committee's principles for handling a group of standing committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and announced that He Hengfu, the owner of Qianchang Trading Company, was a completely illegal household. Wei Jinfei pointed out that only through thorough confession can one obtain lenient treatment from the People's Government.

Next, the meeting ordered He Hengfu to confess in public. However, the major unscrupulous merchant He Hengfu still used his cunning tricks in his speech and refused to honestly confess his crimes. The masses present were extremely angry about this and submitted notes requesting to expose him. Those who took the stage to expose him included: Wang Zhaoming, representative of the Federation of Industry and Commerce Trade Union; Yu Yanxi, accountant of Qianchang Trading Company; Li Hanqing, handler; Zhang Weixian, accountant of Yongchang Oil Company; Tang Tianchi, secretary of Chunyuan Oil Company; Yu Yajun, staff member of Yongsheng Trading Company; Li Jingwen, general manager of Yirui Trading Company; Cheng Huabiao, deputy manager of Huanian Industrial Company; Lin Houzhou, Wang Yiming, and Wang Jiqing, deputy directors of the Federation of Industry and Commerce; Zhao Houfu, Li Wujiu, Yu Zhichen, and Yu Dejun, members; and Quan Yudao, representative of the Hanyang Bamboo and Timber Industry. The materials exposed at the meeting fully proved that He Hengfu was a major unscrupulous merchant with heinous crimes. He, under the guise of a member of the People's Government and a people's representative, secretly organized and led a large-scale theft group, sent spies to infiltrate government financial and economic organs, bribed cadres, evaded taxes, stole national economic intelligence, and undermined the economic policies of the People's Government. According to the partial figures that have now been tallied, the state property stolen by the group has reached hundreds of billions of yuan. During the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, He Hengfu refused to confess and prevented other corrupt and thieving elements in the group from confessing, plotting to undermine the movement.

The meeting finally unanimously passed a resolution to dismiss He Hengfu from the position of Director of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, and requested the Central-South Military and Political Committee and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government to revoke all of He Hengfu's positions in government organs and arrest him for prosecution according to the law.

    接着，大会责令贺衡夫当众坦白。但是大奸商贺衡夫在发言时依然施展其狡猾伎俩，不肯老老实实地坦白自己的罪行。到会群众对此莫不愤怒万分，纷纷递条子要求检举。先后上台检举的有：工商联工会代表王照明，乾昌贸易行会计余延熙，经手李汉卿，永昌油行会计张维贤，春源油行秘书唐天池，永生贸易行职员余亚俊，义瑞贸易行总经理李景文，华年实业公司副经理程华彪，工商联副主任委员林厚周、王一鸣、王际清，委员赵厚甫、厉无咎、余智琛、喻德浚，汉阳竹木业代表全裕道等。会上检举的材料充分证明：贺衡夫是罪大恶极的大奸商。他披着人民政府委员、人民代表的外衣，暗中组织并领导大规模的盗窃集团，派遣坐探钻入政府财经机关，贿赂干部，偷税漏税，盗窃国家经济情报，破坏人民政府的经济政策，据部分现已统计出来的数目，该集团所盗窃的国家财产已达数千亿元。在反贪污、反盗窃运动中，贺衡夫又拒不坦白，并阻止该集团中其他贪污盗窃分子坦白，阴谋破坏运动。
