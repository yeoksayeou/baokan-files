    Subei People's Administrative Office
    Decides to Investigate Serious Phenomena of Corruption and Waste of Disaster Relief Grain Funds

    Editor Comrades: We believe that the opinion of Comrade Hu Chengwen, published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 23rd, which exposes the serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and embezzlement of disaster relief grain funds in our region and demands a thorough investigation, is very good; it has powerfully promoted our work of investigating disaster relief grain funds.
    In the past three years, the Central Government and East China region have allocated over 96.0 million jin of rice and 17.56 billion yuan in cash (not including other disaster relief materials and grain funds donated by the masses) to our region for disaster relief. These grain funds, except for over 470,000 jin of rice directly used by the Subei Repatriation Station, were distributed through the various prefectures, counties, and municipal governments. Over the years, in the process of managing and distributing these grain funds, many serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and embezzlement have indeed occurred. Although these instances of corruption, waste, and embezzlement of disaster relief grain funds should primarily be the responsibility of the illegal elements themselves, they are also inseparable from our serious bureaucracy. Over the years, although we have paid attention to these situations during each disaster assessment and have specifically organized forces to conduct inspections, and each time we have notified these situations to various places, ordering them to check and correct them, we have not paid enough attention to the situations we have discovered at that time and have not grasped them tightly, so that we have not been able to stop and correct them in a timely and effective manner. The Central Government and East China region have also given several instructions in this regard, emphasizing that disaster relief grain funds should be strictly managed and reported on schedule, and the Administrative Office has also formulated several specific measures based on local experience and issued them to various places for implementation (such as democratic management, public announcement by village, etc.); but after these instructions were issued, we did not check them in time and did not supervise them enough, so they were not well implemented in some areas. All these have given a few illegal elements loopholes for corruption and waste.
    At present, we are vigorously checking and overcoming these shortcomings, and taking the work of investigating disaster relief grain funds as an important part of the current "Three-Anti" movement, in order to thoroughly eliminate the corrupt elements who have embezzled disaster relief grain funds. We will definitely clarify all the accounts of disaster relief grain funds, together with the process, and announce them publicly. Now, in addition to cleaning up the situation of the direct teams handling disaster relief grain funds and publishing it in the local newspapers, we have ordered each prefecture to carry out cleaning and publish it in the newspapers and among the local masses.
                                            Subei People's Administrative Office

### 苏北人民行政公署  决清查贪污浪费救灾粮款的严重现象

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    苏北人民行政公署
    决清查贪污浪费救灾粮款的严重现象
    编辑同志：我们认为二月二十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”所载胡成文同志对本区贪污、浪费和挪用救灾粮款的严重现象的揭发和要求彻底进行检查的意见很好；这对我们进行清查救灾粮款的工作，起了有力的推动作用。
    三年来，中央和华东核拨我区救灾粮款计有大米九千六百多万斤，现款一百七十五亿六千多万元（其他救灾实物及群众捐献粮款尚不在内）。这些粮款，除苏北遣送站直接支用折合大米四十七万多斤外，其余的都是通过各专署、县、市政府分发的。历年来，各地在管理与发放这些粮款过程中，确实发生不少贪污、浪费和挪用的严重现象。这些贪污、浪费和挪用救灾粮款现象的发生，虽然主要应由违法分子本人负责，但也是和我们的严重的官僚主义分不开的。历年来，虽然在每次检查灾情时，也曾注意了这些情况，也曾专门组织力量进行检查，并且每一次都把这些情况通报各地，责令检查纠正，但由于当时我们对已发现的这些情况还重视不够，抓得不紧，以致没有做到及时有效地制止和纠正。中央和华东在这方面也曾作过若干次的指示，强调对于救灾粮款要严格管理和按期结报，行署也曾根据各地经验，规定了若干具体办法，通令各地执行（比如民主管理、按村公布等）；但这些指示下达以后，同样因为我们没有及时检查，督促不够，在某些地区还没有很好贯彻。这些都给少数违法分子以贪污、浪费的空隙。
    目前我们正在大力检查与克服以上这些缺点，把清查救灾粮款工作，作为当前“三反”运动的重要内容之一，以求彻底肃清贪污救灾粮款的贪污分子。我们定将弄清全部救灾粮款的账目，连同经过情形一并公布。现在我们除正在清理直属队处理救灾粮款的情况并在当地报纸上公布外，已责成各专署进行清理，并在报纸上及当地群众中公布。
