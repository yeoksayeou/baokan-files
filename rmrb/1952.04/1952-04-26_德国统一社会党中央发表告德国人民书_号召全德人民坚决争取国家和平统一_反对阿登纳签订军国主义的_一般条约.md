Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th (TASS dispatch): The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has issued a letter to the German people, excerpts of which are as follows:

    Workers, peasants, and intellectuals, German bourgeoisie! Patriots of all parties and religions! The moment that determines the fate of the nation has arrived. The Adenauer government of West Germany is painstakingly trying to force West Germany to accept the "General Treaty" serving military purposes as soon as possible, because it fears the rising movement of the people to strive for the restoration of German unity and the signing of a peace treaty. Adenauer wants to sign the militaristic "General Treaty" in the next few weeks, violating the clear will of the people. If this "General Treaty" is signed, it will mean maintaining indefinitely the arbitrary rule of the Western imperialist occupiers over West Germany, it will mean West Germany joining the military treaty system of US imperialism in preparation for launching a third world war, it will mean fixing by treaty that West Germany will serve as the main base of aggression for the United States in Europe, and at the same time open the door to the establishment of a West German military dictatorship. The purpose of Western countries in signing the militaristic "General Treaty" is to obstruct the signing of a German peace treaty and to deprive the German people of the prospect of peaceful reunification.

    But, they are really planning without consulting the host! German citizens across Germany! At present, it is necessary to prevent the fatal consequences for Germany caused by the signing of the militaristic "General Treaty". Today, the two parts of Germany can still be reunited peacefully. And tomorrow, every German will understand: once the militaristic "General Treaty" is signed, once the most severe period of division arrives, the unification of our motherland will be more difficult and more distant. Therefore, all Germans are currently faced with a significant choice: either sign a four-power treaty with Germany—this is peace; or Adenauer's militaristic "General Treaty"—this is the establishment of a military dictatorship in West Germany and an increase in the threat of war. The Soviet government's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and establishing an all-German government proves that a fair and lasting solution to the German question exists! The way is that the four countries responsible for governing Germany immediately begin negotiations on concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and the Germans themselves must immediately reach an agreement on holding free all-German elections. But the Western countries and the Adenauer government are doing their best to prevent an agreement between the major powers and the German people.

    Men, women, and young people of West Germany and West Berlin! Expose the sinister conspiracy of foreign and West German arms dealers! Recognize the enemies and those who are driving Germany to destruction as soon as possible! Oppose the remilitarization of West Germany and the organization of mercenary armies by all means! Every patriotic German opposes this mercenary army and demands the establishment of a national army composed in a democratic and peaceful spirit and aimed at defending democratic Germany. Only such an army will serve the cause of European peace. Do not give the West German aggressor mercenary army a single person or a single penny! This struggle must be carried out more actively and resolutely than ever before! All peace-loving people strive to overthrow the Adenauer government, which is implementing a war policy!

    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany calls on all peace-loving democratic forces to unite firmly and carry out a resolute struggle. The situation in West Germany is becoming urgent. It is necessary to use the decisive weapon in the hands of the workers, namely the weapons of trade union organization and strikes. Workers from the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and the Christian Democratic Union, along with non-party workers! From short warning strikes, move on to further steps, namely mass strikes, to oppose remilitarization and the "General Treaty", to fight for unification in peace and freedom, and to strive to meet personal social demands! Workers, peasants, and intellectuals! Unite, act decisively together, hold mass rallies, organize demonstrations, turn May Day into a day of struggle to strive for a quick and peaceful solution to the German people's vital issues, and into a mass struggle against militarization, the "General Treaty," and the Adenauer government.

    Compatriots and young people of the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Sector of Berlin! Answer the policy of Bonn by further consolidating our progressive democratic system! Be vigilant and do everything possible to defend the democratic system and the magnificent construction plan. Enhance labor enthusiasm and march on the road to new production victories! The motherland will rely on the German Democratic Republic, the most important foundation, in the struggle for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    German compatriots in the eastern and western regions of our motherland! Unite around the National Front of Democratic Germany and fight for peace and unity, for a better and happier new life!

    德国统一社会党中央发表告德国人民书
    号召全德人民坚决争取国家和平统一
    反对阿登纳签订军国主义的“一般条约”
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会发表告德国人民书，摘要如下：
    工人、农民和知识分子们、德国资产阶级！各党派各宗教的爱国者们！决定民族命运的时刻来到了。西德阿登纳政府处心积虑地试图尽快强迫西德接受服务于军事目的的“一般条约”，因为它害怕人民争取恢复德国统一、争取签订和约的运动的高涨。阿登纳想就在最近几周内违反人民的明白意志，签订军国主义的“一般条约”。如果这个“一般条约”一旦签订，就意味着无限期地保持西方帝国主义占领者对西德的专横统治，就意味着使西德加入美帝国主义准备发动第三次世界大战的军事公约体系，就意味着把使西德充当美国在欧洲的主要侵略基地用条约固定下来，同时打开建立西德军事独裁的大门。西方国家签订军国主义“一般条约”的目的，是要阻挠签订对德和约，是要剥夺德国人民和平统一的前途。
    但是，它们这真是目无主人的打算！德国全国各地的德国公民们！目前必须阻止由于签订军国主义“一般条约”而将造成的那种将使德国遭受致命后果的形势。今天德国两个部分还可以用和平的方式重新统一起来。而明天每个德国人将明白：一旦军国主义的“一般条约”签订了，一旦最严重的分裂的苦难时期到来，我们祖国的统一就要更加困难，更加遥遥无期了。因此，目前所有的德国人都面临着具有重大意义的选择：或者是签订四国对德和约——这就是和平；或者是阿登纳的军国主义的“一般条约”——这就是在西德建立军事独裁和增加战争威胁。苏联政府关于缔结对德和约及建立全德政府的建议证明，公正而持久地解决德国问题的途径是存在着的！这途径就是，执行管制德国职务的四国立即开始关于缔结对德和约的谈判，德国人之间则必须就举行全德自由选举一事立即达成协议。但是西方各国和阿登纳政府却竭力阻止在各大国之间和德国人民之间取得协议。
    西德和西柏林的男人、妇女和青年们！揭穿外国和西德军火大王的罪恶阴谋！及早认清敌人和把德国驱向毁灭的人！用各种办法反对西德重新军国主义化，反对组织雇佣军！每个爱国的德国人都反对这种雇佣军，要求建立以民主、和平的精神组成的、以保卫民主德国为目的的全国军队，只有这种军队才会为欧洲和平事业服务。不给西德侵略雇佣军一个人，一文钱！必须比任何时候都更积极更坚决地进行这个斗争！所有拥护和平者努力设法推翻执行战争政策的阿登纳政府！
    德国统一社会党中央委员会号召一切爱好和平的民主力量牢牢地团结在一起，进行坚决的斗争。西德情势已趋紧急，必须使用工人手中的决定性武器，即工会组织和罢工的武器。西德参加社会民主党、共产党、基督教民主党的工人们与无党无派的工人们！从短暂的警告罢工，转而采取进一步的步骤，即采取群众性的罢工，来反对重新军国主义化与“一般条约”，争取在和平自由情况下的统一，争取满足切身社会要求！工人、农民和知识分子们！团结起来，坚决共同行动，举行群众大会，组织游行示威，把五一节变为争取尽速和平解决德国人民切身重大问题的斗争日，变为反对军国主义化、“一般条约”和阿登纳政府的群众斗争。
    德意志民主共和国与柏林民主区的男女同胞们、青年们！用进一步巩固我们进步的民主制度，来回答波恩的政策！要提高警惕，全力捍卫民主的制度和宏伟的建设计划。要提高劳动热情，在新的生产胜利的大道上迈进！祖国将在争取统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争中依靠德意志民主共和国这个最重要的基础。
    在我们祖国东西两区的德国同胞们！团结在民主德国全国阵线的周围，为和平与统一，为美好幸福的新生活而奋斗！
