    New Atmosphere at Tianjin Private Zhenhua Wire Factory After the "Five-Anti" Campaign
    The private Zhenhua Wire Factory in the 11th District of Tianjin City has shown a thriving atmosphere after the "Five-Anti" movement. The factory has been increasing workers and adding machines in recent days, and the quality of its products has greatly improved. This is the valuable result of the workers in the factory mobilizing and urging the capitalists to confess their past illegal activities, enabling them to receive lenient treatment from the government, and then further urging the capitalists to improve their management while actively engaging in production.
    After the "Five-Anti" movement, the class consciousness of the workers in Zhenhua Factory has been unprecedentedly enhanced. In particular, after reviewing the "’Five-Anti’ Conclusion Report Form" of the capitalists, the sense of being masters of the country has been greatly strengthened. After the capitalists were announced by the government to receive lenient treatment at the end of February, the workers took the initiative to hold a temporary labor-management consultation meeting with the capitalists on March 1st, and agreed to formulate eleven specific measures for developing and improving business management. Xu Zhizhou, the manager of the factory, also proposed several guarantees on the spot, including opening up accounts, opening up contracts, and relying on employees to improve production. The seventh of the eleven measures is: "Strengthen machinery and equipment, and strive to install and refit machines as soon as possible." The factory originally had more than 50 machines of various types, such as stranding, wrapping, and weaving, which were installed far apart and some were not in accordance with the production process. After the workers proposed and reached an agreement this time, the capitalists immediately re-equipped them. Various machines are arranged in the order of production, and similar machines are installed together as much as possible. This not only facilitates production, but also greatly reduces the waste of production time. After the changes, space was freed up to add new machines, and machines purchased last year, such as rubber rollers, double-headed rubber machines, and wire drawing machines, are being installed. In addition, at the suggestion of the workers, the factory has set up equipment for inspecting electric wires such as water pools, sun lamps, and megohmmeters.
    The labor-management consultation meeting also divided the factory’s 47 workers into seven production groups according to production needs: stranding, wrapping, cloth wrapping, weaving, chemical engineering, finished product inspection, and finished product packaging. Then, the factory's trade union organization launched each group of workers to put forward production plans and guarantees. The guarantee of the finished product inspection team is: "Not to allow a single unqualified wire to leave the factory." In the past, the wires produced by the factory were almost completely substandard, and the capitalists arbitrarily cut corners and manufactured crudely. There was no equipment for inspecting the wires at all. Most of the rubber skin on the wires had pinholes, and they would leak electricity when they were damp. But now the quality of the products has greatly changed. The workers of the inspection team use various methods to check the quality of the wires: put the wires into hot water to see if the water surface is bubbling and whether the rubber skin has pinholes; use a megohmmeter to test whether the wires are truly insulated. If problems are found, they are immediately returned to the relevant production team for repair or cutting, and the wires must meet all the specifications before they are allowed to leave the factory. The workers in the stranding team carefully distinguish the gauge and quality of the copper wires using "micrometers" and "metering machines." The workers in the rubber coating group use sun lamps to check whether the rubber cloth has pinholes. Each group of workers uses raw materials according to the contract and produces according to the specifications on the contract. Worker Li Jialan said: "Now it's better, the contract is public, and the contract has been reviewed by the trade union. When production tasks come, we will definitely act in accordance with the contract, and supervise production in the capacity of masters of the country, and we will never allow the capitalists to engage in illegal activities again."
    In the past, the factory's crudely manufactured products were often returned by buyers after they were sold. Now that the quality has improved, the products are selling well. The factory recently delivered 40 coils of four types of wires and 20 coils of two types of wires to the state-owned Tianjin Industrial Equipment Company, and 30 coils of two types of wires to the Trust Company. At the same time, the factory has accepted orders for 20 coils of two types of wires, 50 meters of four types of wires, and 2,500 meters of telephone wires introduced by the Trust Company.
    In order to make production planned, the Zhenhua Factory's trade union organization recently consulted with the capitalists to formulate a factory-wide production and conservation plan based on the plans of each production group. In the nine months from April to the end of the year, the plan is to produce a total value of more than 6.9 billion yuan, and to increase production and conservation by more than 1.4 billion yuan. The capitalist's idea of ignoring employee welfare has also changed. According to the business situation and work needs, the labor and management of the factory agreed to add a workers' dormitory.

### 天津私营振华电线工厂“五反”后的新气象

    天津私营振华电线工厂“五反”后的新气象
    天津市第十一区私营振华电线工厂，经过“五反”运动，呈现了欣欣向荣的气象。该厂连日来增工人，添机器，产品质量大大提高。这是全厂工人在动员督促资方坦白了过去的违法行为，使他获得政府宽大处理以后，又进一步一面督促资方改进经营，一面积极生产的宝贵成果。
    振华工厂的工人经过“五反”运动，阶级觉悟空前提高，特别是审查资方“‘五反’结论报告表”以后，国家主人翁的思想大大加强。当资方在二月底被政府宣布宽大处理以后，工人们在三月一日就主动找资方举行了一个临时劳资协商会议，协议制订出十一条发展和改善经营管理的具体办法。该厂经理徐志周也当场提出公开账目、公开合同、依靠职工搞好生产的几项保证。十一条办法中的第七条是：“加强机器设备，争取时间装设和改装机器。”该厂原有合股、包胶、编织等各种机器五十多台，装置得相距很远，并且有些不合生产程序。这次经工人提出并达成协议以后，资方马上重新改装。各种机器按生产顺序排列，同类机器尽可能装设在一起。这样既便利了生产，也大大减少了生产时间的浪费。改变装置以后，又腾出添设新机器的地盘正在安装去年购进的轧胶滚子、双龙头胶皮机、拔丝机等机器。另外，在工人建议下，厂内已设置了水池、太阳灯、摇表等检验电线的设备。
    这次劳资协商会还根据生产需要把全厂四十七个工人划分为绞丝、包胶、包布、编织、化工、成品检验、成品包装等七个生产小组。接着该厂的工会组织又发动各组工人提出了生产计划和保证条件。成品检验组的保证条件是：“不使一根不合规格的电线出厂”。过去该厂所出的电线几乎完全不合规格，资方任意偷工减料，粗制滥造，厂里根本没有检验电线的设备。电线的胶皮上大多带有砂眼，一潮湿就会走电。但是现在产品的质量就大大改观了。检验组的工人们用各种方法查验电线的质量：把电线放进热水里，看水面是否起泡，胶皮有没有砂眼；用摇表试验电线是否真正绝缘。发现了毛病，就马上退回有关生产小组去修补或剪掉，必须一切都合规格才让电线出厂。绞丝组的工人用“千分尺”、“量米机”等认真区分铜丝的号别和质量。包胶组的工人用太阳灯察看胶布有没有砂眼。每组的工人都是按照合同规定的原料用料，按合同上的规格生产。工人李嘉兰说：“现在好了，合同公开了，并且合同是经工会审查过的。生产任务一来，我们就绝对按照合同办事，就以国家主人的资格监督生产，决不允许资本家再干非法勾当。”
    该厂过去粗制滥造的产品，售出后买主常常上门来退换。现在质量提高，产品也好销了。该厂最近给国营天津工业器材公司制作的四十盘四种电线和二十盘二种电线，给信托公司制作的三十盘二种电线，都已顺利地交了货。同时该厂又接受了信托公司介绍的二十盘二种电线、五十公尺四种电线、二千五百公尺电话线的定货。
    振华工厂的工会组织为使生产走向计划化，最近根据各个生产小组的计划和资方协商制订了全厂的生产节约计划。从四月份到年底的九个月中，计划生产总值六十九亿多元，此外还要增产节约共十四亿多元。资方忽视职工福利的思想也有了转变。根据营业情况和工作需要，该厂劳资双方协议通过，决定增添工人宿舍一所。（新华社）
