Xi'an Elementary School Teacher He Jianyi Improves Teaching Methods, Creating Successful Experiences in Half-Day Teaching

He Jianyi, a teacher at Shangdelu Elementary School in Xi'an, has created successful experiences in half-day teaching.

After the summer vacation last year, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, in order to solve the problem of school dropouts, converted most of the classes below the second grade in the city's elementary schools into a "half-day, two-shift system." He Jianyi is the homeroom teacher of Class C of the first grade at Shangdelu Elementary School. The sixty-four students in that class only come to school in the afternoon every day, attending classes for only half a day.

He Jianyi had never taught half-day students before and had no experience, so she was very afraid that she would not be able to teach well. Sure enough, difficulties arose soon after the start of the semester. During class, students always arrived sporadically, and fights and quarrels occurred constantly. Originally, the half-day teaching time was already insufficient, and a lot of time had to be spent organizing the classroom order every lesson, so the students' studies were naturally affected. Some students still couldn't write out the ten numbers after attending school for more than a month. Some homework that had to be assigned to students to do at home was frequently not turned in by a third of the class. Although He Jianyi had visited the students' parents and asked them to assist in managing and educating the children, most of the parents of this class were peddlers and porters who worked outside all day, and the students' mothers were also busy with housework, so it was impossible for them to effectively supervise their children's homework at home. Therefore, many students spent their time playing outside after finishing their half-day classes, and some even went to "Minle Yuan" every day to watch the clown perform. None of them had developed a habit of liking to study.

After studying this situation, He Jianyi realized that the way to improve was to "organize students in a guided manner and carry out extracurricular learning." She then proposed to the school leaders to organize "self-study groups" among the students. After this plan was approved, she divided the whole class into eleven "self-study groups" according to the students' home addresses and designated group leaders. Every afternoon, she assigned homework to the groups, and the next morning, she went to each group for guidance.

After the "self-study groups" were organized, some groups studied better, some groups had incomplete attendance, and some groups played together after gathering, not studying properly. He Jianyi then told the students a story about Chairman Mao's childhood study life during the language class, "Wanting to See Chairman Mao." She also praised the Jin Fengxian group, which was doing well in extracurricular studies, saying that they were good students of Chairman Mao. At the same time, she also criticized those groups that did not abide by the learning discipline. She also guided the students to formulate a "Self-Study Group Learning Covenant." The covenant also stipulated that the group should listen to the adults of the family where the study took place. He Jianyi then gave everyone a schedule for extracurricular activities, stipulating that they should do one hour of homework every day, with a half-hour group play in between. In addition, He Jianyi also led the group leaders to organize regular group leader meetings to solve problems that occurred in each group at any time.

While urging the children to implement the learning covenant and schedule, He Jianyi also paid more attention to combining classroom teaching with the learning life of the "self-study group." She set aside a certain amount of time every day to give life guidance speeches to the children. In this way, the "self-study groups" gradually got on the right track, students were able to attend fully, and homework was no longer lacking. When attending classes in school, the classroom order was also better. The Jin Fengxian group, which had good results in the "self-study group," now sang songs in a queue after finishing their homework, just like in school, before dismissing.

He Jianyi also paid attention to guiding the group leaders to especially help students with shortcomings. For example, Han Peizheng of Zhang Qiuxiang's group liked to skip school and fight. The classmates didn't like him and called him "good-for-nothing." After Zhang Qiuxiang heard He Jianyi's words, she went to play and study with Han Peizheng every day, establishing a friendship. Other students also helped Han Peizheng. Han Peizheng felt that someone loved him, so he began to love school and classmates, and gradually changed his bad habits of skipping school and fighting. This incident made the students know that they should enthusiastically help backward students to progress.

At the end of the semester, Class C of the first grade at Shangdelu Elementary School showed excellent performance in discipline, winning the "First in Discipline" red flag among the fourteen classes. The average academic score of the whole class reached 79.4 points. He Jianyi's teaching method has received help and direct guidance from the Northwest Military and Political Committee Education Department and the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education. According to the inspection of the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, the results of implementing this "half-day teaching method" in Class C of the first grade at Shangdelu Elementary School have completely caught up with the results of full-day teaching. When summarizing her experience in obtaining this achievement, He Jianyi said that the main reason was the use of various methods to cultivate children's conscious learning and life discipline.

    西安小学教员贺剑仪改进教学方法
    在半日制教学中创造了成功的经验
    西安市尚德路小学教员贺剑仪在半日制教学中创造了成功的经验。
    西安市人民政府文教局在去年暑假后，为了解决失学儿童入学的问题，把全市大部分小学二年级以下的学级改成了“半日二部制”。贺剑仪是尚德路小学一年级丙班的班主任。那一班的六十四个学生，都是每天下午到学校来，只上半天课。
    贺剑仪以前没有教过半日制的学生，没有经验，很怕教不好。果然，开学不久，困难便发生了。上课时，学生们总是零零落落地来到，打架、吵闹的事不断发生。本来，半天的教学时间已经不够，每节课还要花很大时间来整理课堂秩序，学生们的学业自然受了影响。有的学生上学一个多月还不会把十个数目字写出来。有些必须指定学生回家去做的作业，全班有三分之一的学生经常交不上。贺剑仪虽然曾经去访问过学生家长，要求家长们协助管理和教育儿童。可是这一班学生的家长极大部分是摊贩和搬运工人，整日在外面劳动，学生的母亲们又多忙着家务，都没有可能很好地督促孩子们在家作功课。因此，许多学生在上完半天课以外的时间，都是在外边玩耍，有的还天天上“民乐园”去看三花脸演戏，谁也没有养成爱好念书的习惯。
    贺剑仪研究了这种情况之后，认识到改进的办法是“必须有指导地把学生组织起来，进行课外学习”。她就向学校领导方面提出在学生中间组织“自学小组”，这个计划得到批准后，她便按着学生的家庭住址，把全班编成了十一个“自学小组”，指定了小组长。每天下午她给小组布置好作业，第二天上午便一个个小组去巡回指导。
    “自学小组”组织起来后，有的小组学习得比较好，有的小组学生到不齐，有的小组学生们到一起后又玩起来，不好好学习。贺剑仪就在上国语课
    “要见毛主席”的时候，向学生们讲了一个毛主席幼时学习生活的故事。她又在课堂上表扬了课外学习得好的金凤仙小组，说他们是毛主席的好学生。同时，她也对那些不遵守学习纪律的小组提出了批评。她又指导学生们订立了“自学小组学习公约”。公约上还订出小组在那一家学习，就要听那一家大人的话。贺剑仪接着又给大家规定了课外作息时间表，规定每天做一个小时功课，中间作半小时集体游玩。此外，贺剑仪还领导各小组长组织了定期的小组长会议，随时解决各小组发生的问题。
    贺剑仪一方面督促儿童执行学习公约和作息时间，同时更注意把课堂教学和“自学组”的学习生活结合起来，她每天都抽出一定时间向儿童作生活指导讲话。这样，“自学小组”一个个都逐渐上了正轨，学生都能到齐，作业也都不缺。在学校中上课时，课堂秩序也好了。“自学小组”成绩好的金凤仙小组，现在每天做完功课，还和学校中一样，排着队唱了歌才散学。
    贺剑仪还注意指导各小组长要特别帮助有缺点的同学。如张秋香小组的韩佩正爱逃学，爱打架。同学都不喜欢他，叫他“二流子”。张秋香听了贺剑仪的话以后，便天天找韩佩正一块玩，一块学习，建立了感情。别的同学也都帮助韩佩正。韩佩正感到有人爱他，也就开始爱学校，爱同学，一天天把逃学和打架的坏习惯改掉了。这件事，使学生们都知道应该热心地去帮助落后的同学进步。
    上学期结束的时候，尚德路小学一年级丙班在纪律上表现了优异的成绩，在十四个班中，得到“纪律第一”的红旗。全班学业成绩平均达到了七十九·四分。贺剑仪这种教学方法，曾得到了西北军政委员会教育部和西安市人民政府文教局的帮助和直接指导。据西安市人民政府文教局的检查，尚德路小学一年级丙班实行这种“半日制教学法”的结果，已完全赶上了全日教学的成绩。对于这种成绩的获得，贺剑仪在总结她的经验时说，主要是运用各种方法培养了儿童们自觉的学习和生活纪律的缘故。　（新华社）
