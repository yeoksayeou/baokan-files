    To the Editor: After the Central People's Government Ministry of Education published the "Report on the Adjustment Plan for National Institutes of Technology," it was warmly endorsed by teachers and students of Peking University.

    Cao Jinghua, Chairman of the Department of Russian Language, said: The adjustment plan for national institutes of technology is a major event in the history of Chinese people's education. This rational measure can only be realized under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. For nearly a century, in semi-colonial China, schools became strongholds for bureaucratic warlords to cultivate their personal power, or breeding grounds for imperialists to cultivate tools to enslave China. In the past, schools were designed with departments based on individuals, with overlapping structures, separate divisions, and each doing its own thing, which was very unreasonable. After the adjustment of departments, this phenomenon will no longer exist. Tang Aoqing, a teacher in the Department of Chemistry, said: After the adjustment of departments, we can concentrate our strength and train a larger number of cadres. Teacher Sun Yiliang said: The adjustment of national institutes of technology is only the first step in the adjustment of national universities and colleges. We hope that national universities and colleges will successfully complete this glorious task. Teacher Huang Shicheng said: This adjustment of national institutes of technology officially announces that the old-style universities are gradually embarking on the path of new-style universities. What is particularly exciting is the establishment of several specialized industrial colleges, from which we can see the beautiful prospects of national construction. All the students of Peking University warmly support the adjustment plan for institutes of technology. Students from the Department of Botany said: We have a part-time teacher in the Department of Botany who teaches here for three hours and at Tsinghua University for three hours, coming and going every other day. After the adjustment of departments, this phenomenon will no longer exist. This will not only reduce unnecessary national expenditures, but also free up a large amount of manpower and material resources to do more work. A student from the Department of Economics said excitedly: From this adjustment plan, we can see the bright future of the large-scale construction that the motherland is about to undertake. For the sake of the motherland, and in order to contribute more to the construction of the motherland, from today onwards, I must redouble my efforts to train and improve myself. After reading this report, students from the Department of Mathematics immediately wrote to all the students in the Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University, expressing their heartfelt welcome to them to study together at Peking University.

    北京大学的教师和学生
    热烈拥护调整全国工学院
    编辑同志：中央人民政府教育部“关于全国工学院调整方案的报告”发表以后，获得北京大学的教师和学生热烈的拥护。
    俄语系系主任曹靖华说：全国工学院调整方案是中国人民教育史上的一个重大事件。这一合理的措置，只有在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，才能实现。近百年来，在半殖民地的中国，学校成为官僚军阀培养私人势力的地盘，或帝国主义在中国培养奴役中国的工具的苗床。过去的学校因人设系，叠床架屋，分门别户，各自为政，诸多不合理；院系调整以后，这种现象就不再存在了。化学系唐敖庆教师说：院系调整后，可集中力量，更大量地培养干部。孙亦梁教师说：全国工学院的调整，只是全国高等学校调整的第一步。我们希望全国高等学校顺利地完成这个光荣的任务。黄仕承教师说：这次全国工学院的调整，正式宣布了旧型大学逐步走上新型大学的方向。尤其令人兴奋的是成立了好几个专门工业学院，从这点可以看出祖国建设的美丽远景。北京大学全体同学热烈拥护工学院调整方案。植物系的同学说：我们植物系有一位兼任教师，他在我们这儿教三小时，又在清华大学教三小时，三天两头到。院系调整以后，这样的现象就不存在了，如此不只可以减少国家不必要的开支，而且可以抽出大批人力物力作更多的工作。经济系有一位同学兴奋地说：从这个调整方案中，可以看出祖国即将进行大规模建设的光明前途。为了祖国，为了使自己在祖国建设中能贡献出更大的力量，从今天起，我必须加倍努力锻炼和提高自己。数学系同学读了这个报告以后，立即去信给清华大学数学系全体同学，表示衷心地欢迎他们来北京大学一道学习。
