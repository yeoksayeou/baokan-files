Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 20th: Following the victorious conclusion of the large-scale strike by over one million Japanese workers against the reactionary Yoshida government's fascist bill, the Committee Against Revising the Labor Standards Law held a meeting on the 19th. This meeting summarized the experiences of the general strike on April 18th, resolved to wage a determined struggle against the so-called "Prevention of Destructive Activities" fascist bill, and decided that if the Japanese government attempts to revise labor laws or propose a bill banning general strikes, it will take effective action again, including strikes.

On April 19th, more than 6,000 coal miners in Fukushima Prefecture went on strike to protest the "Prevention of Destructive Activities Bill."

Newspaper reports indicate that criticism of this bill is becoming increasingly sharp even among the rank and file of the ruling party, the Liberal Party. Influenced by the general strike, the Liberal Party's Diet Policy Committee has decided to make certain revisions to the government's "Prevention of Destructive Activities Bill" if necessary.

    日本工人坚持斗争
    反对吉田政府法西斯法案
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社东京二十日讯：在日本工人阶级为了反对吉田反动政府的法西斯法案而举行的一百多万人的大罢工胜利结束以后，反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会十九日举行了一次会议。这次会议总结了四月十八日总罢工的经验，决定进行坚决斗争，反对所谓“防止破坏活动”的法西斯法案，并且决定：如果日本政府企图修改劳工法或者提出禁止总罢工的法案，就再采取包括罢工在内的有效行动。
    四月十九日福岛县六千多名煤矿工人举行罢工，抗议“防止破坏活动法案”。
    报纸消息说：甚至在政府党——自由党的下层群众中，对这个法案的批评也愈来愈尖锐。在总罢工的影响下，自由党的国会政策委员会已决定：必要时对政府的“防止破坏活动法案”予以某些修改。
