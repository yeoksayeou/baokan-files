    University Teachers Continue to Write to This Newspaper
    Condemning the American Bandits Who Wage Germ Warfare
    --Excerpts from Readers' Letters
    University teachers continue to write to this newspaper, denouncing the American aggressors who launched germ warfare. Now, excerpts of some of these letters are published.
    The entire faculty of professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants of the Transportation Engineering Department of the Northern Jiaotong University's Beijing Institute write: "We have further recognized the ferocious face of the American bandits. We are determined to answer the American bandits, whose crimes are heinous, with new victories on the ideological remolding front. We are determined to do everything in our power to publicize epidemic prevention and expose the crimes of the American bandits." The entire faculty of the Chemistry Department of Fu Jen Catholic University writes: "We must not tolerate the monstrous crime of American imperialism in waging germ warfare. We must now turn our anger into strength, contribute all the scientific and technological knowledge we have mastered, and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland, go to the forefront of the anti-germ warfare, and repel the vicious attacks of American imperialism." Fu Zhongsun, Dean of Academic Affairs of Beijing Normal University, wrote: "American imperialists previously wanted to use atomic weapons to intimidate peace-loving people all over the world, but they did not succeed. Now, they are using germ weapons in a despicable way. But this shameless atrocity will also be defeated by us!" Lin Changshan, Chairman of the Biology Department of Yenching University, wrote: "We demand the trial of American germ warfare criminals. As one of the insect researchers, I am determined to unite with relevant scientific workers, study together, prepare to respond to the solemn call of the motherland at any time, accept the glorious task of anti-germ warfare, and fight to the end to defend the motherland!"
