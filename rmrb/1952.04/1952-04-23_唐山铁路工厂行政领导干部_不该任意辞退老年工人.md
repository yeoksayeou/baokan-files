    Tangshan Railway Factory Administrative Leaders
    Should Not Arbitrarily Dismiss Elderly Workers
    Comrade Editor: The administrative side of the Tangshan Railway Factory treats elderly workers in an extremely irresponsible manner. Feng Gang, a worker in the repair shop, is sixty-six years old and has more than thirty years of service. The administration thought he was too old and ordered him to retire last year, but the union and he himself disagreed, so he could not be dismissed. Last May, he attempted suicide due to family problems. The administration used this as an excuse, saying, "Feng Gang has agreed to resign," thereby obtaining the union's consent. After Feng Gang left the hospital, the administration paid him more than three months of severance pay and dismissed him. Old worker Zheng Wei Yue of the freight car yard also had the same experience. The administration wanted him to retire but did not explain the retirement procedures to him. On January 2, he went to the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for help and was unfortunately run over and killed by a train. In March, the administration paid his family three months' retirement pension. Zhao Guoxing, an old worker at the tool factory, also has more than thirty years of service. The administration wanted him to retire long ago, but he never agreed. Recently, he was sick and did not recover, and the workshop committee applied for an extension of his leave on his behalf; however, the administrative director did not allow it and insisted that he go to work, otherwise he would be dismissed. A few days later, Zhao Guoxing was really unable to go to work, so the administrative director ordered the clerk to write a "voluntary resignation letter," and he was considered to have "voluntarily waived his retirement pension" and retired.
    These elderly workers have long years of service, and they are willing to continue production and contribute more to the country. However, the administrative side of this factory did not consider the elderly workers' work enthusiasm and living conditions, and arbitrarily forced them to retire. This is an undesirable phenomenon in a New Democratic state-owned enterprise. This practice has caused great dissatisfaction among the workers. Regarding this issue, the Tangshan Municipal Labor Bureau had made suggestions to the administrative side of this factory, but they did not accept the Labor Bureau's opinion, so the mistakes continued to occur. We believe that the administrative leaders of the Tangshan Railway Factory should conduct a thorough self-criticism and truly establish the idea of relying on the working class.

### 唐山铁路工厂行政领导干部  不该任意辞退老年工人

    唐山铁路工厂行政领导干部
    不该任意辞退老年工人
    编辑同志：唐山铁路工厂行政方面以极不负责任的办法对待老年工人。修配厂工人冯刚，现年六十六岁，已有三十多年的工龄。行政方面嫌他年纪太大，在去年曾令他退职，但工会和他本人都不同意，所以没有辞退得了。去年五月，因家庭问题，他曾自杀过一次。行政方面就拿这件事作藉口，说
    “冯刚已同意辞职”，因而取得了工会的同意。冯刚出医院后，行政方面发给他三个多月的解雇费，就把他辞退了。货车场老工人郑维岳也有同样的遭遇。行政方面要他退职，而没有对他说明退职的办法。一月二日，他到唐山市总工会请求予以帮助，不幸被火车轧死。到了三月份，行政方面才发了三个月的退职金给他的家属。工具厂老工人赵国庆，也有三十多年的工龄了。行政方面早就要他退职，他始终没有同意。最近，他因病没有好，车间委员会曾代他续假；但行政主任不允许，硬要他上班，否则就要辞退他。过了几天，赵国庆实在不能上班，行政主任就令事务员代写了“自愿退职书”，把他算作“自愿不要退职金”而退职了。
    这些老年工人都有很长的工龄，他们都愿意继续生产，对国家多尽一份力量。但这个工厂的行政方面并没有考虑到老年工人的工作热诚和生活情况，就随意强迫他们退职，这是在新民主主义国营企业中不应有的现象。这种作法在工人当中已引起很大的不满。对于这个问题，唐山市劳动局曾对这个工厂的行政方面提过建议，而他们并未接受劳动局的意见，以致错误继续发生。我们认为，唐山铁路工厂行政领导干部应该进行深刻检讨，真正树立依靠工人阶级的思想。
