    The People of the Kangzang Plateau are Supporting Us
    Pei Guang, Southwest Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation

    With boundless excitement, we entered the vast and rich Kangzang Plateau of our motherland from Chengdu. Here, we more deeply realized the greatness and beauty of our motherland.

    We saw the fertile highland barley fields on both banks of the Yalong River. We saw the grasslands near Yulong where millions of yaks could be grazed, and the primeval forests. We saw the precious local products of the Kangzang Plateau: musk, deer antlers, cordyceps, safflower, antelope horns, and all kinds of animal skins. We also heard about the rich mineral resources hidden on the plateau—gold in the Jinsha River basin, copper and salt in Tongpu and Dege, and oil in the Ningjing Mountains.

    We met the tall, brave, and hardworking Tibetan compatriots, and we met the heroic troops entering Tibet who were fighting on the plateau at an altitude of four to five thousand meters, “opening roads through mountains, building bridges over rivers, and reclaiming wasteland for production when there was no grain.”

    In seven days, in addition to reporting on the combat situation on the Korean front to the troops entering Tibet and Tibetan compatriots, we also visited the homes of Tibetan compatriots and offered our condolences to the People's Liberation Army comrades who had become ill from overwork on the Kangzang Plateau and who had been bravely injured during construction.

    There are a total of twenty counties here. Except for Luding, where there are many Han people, and Jiulong, which is inhabited by the Yi people, the rest are inhabited by Tibetan people. The Central People's Government has designated this area as the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province. People's Representative Conferences of all ethnic groups have been held in all counties under the region's jurisdiction, and Tibetan Autonomous Governments or National Democratic United Governments have been established. The ethnic minorities became masters of their own affairs for the first time. They said with joy: "Our ethnic minorities have been emancipated. In the past, we were only qualified to pay grain, pay taxes, and provide 'Ula' (corvée labor); now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we can work in the People's Government and truly be masters."

    An unprecedented atmosphere of unity has emerged among all ethnic groups. Disputes between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups that could not be resolved for many years have been resolved very smoothly. From November 1950 to September 1951, the local People's Government resolved more than 1,500 internal Tibetan disputes. Before liberation, the Khonsar chieftain of Ganzi and the Masu chieftain killed each other, and they had to bring dozens of bodyguards when they went out; now, after mediation by the People's Government, they have signed a patriotic unity pact and are very harmonious. The 12-year-long feud case of "enemies" between Eight Wan Tseden and Tserang Losong in Batang County was resolved by the People's Government, and the two sides ate at the same table and worked in the same room, becoming models of unity. Many such things have been resolved, and the fraternal ethnic groups call it "resolving feuds." Now everyone demands unity, takes pride in unity, and strives to be a model of unity.

    The People's Liberation Army and working cadres who entered Tibet have established close, friendly unity with the local people. The Tibetan people call them "Basai Jia" (new Han people). Many Tibetans and lamas have asked to join the People's Liberation Army and to participate in government work. The Kangding Military Subdistrict has established a Tibetan militia. A female lama in Ganzi sold her clothes to pay for travel expenses and went to the Kangding Nationalities School to participate in study. When the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held in Kangding, a Tibetan compatriot from Sanyan, a deep mountain area south of Dege, traveled for more than thirty days with dry food on his back to Kangding to meet Li Chunfang, Vice Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, and asked the government to send two cadres to work there. Herdsmen from many remote areas of Ganzi County automatically drove yaks and traveled for several days to the government to pay public grain. They said: "Chairman Mao's policies are always for the benefit of our ethnic minorities." Some lama temples read the "Common Program" and "Nationalities Policy" as classics. Many temples have portraits of Chairman Mao hanging in their scripture halls, and they call Chairman Mao "Living Buddha" and often pray: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live!"

    After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched, it quickly penetrated into the Tibetan areas on the border. More than half of the population in the region received patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea. They said: "Korea is our gateway. We cannot let the American robbers and the Kuomintang oppress us again. We must Resist America, Aid Korea." They took out their most precious local products: musk, deer antlers, Tibetan saffron, cordyceps, and animal skins to donate. Poor herdsmen and farmers twisted yak and sheep wool into woolen yarn to donate, and donated highland barley. Last year, the region donated a high-altitude anti-aircraft gun. The people of Kangding County also wrote 7,000 letters of condolence and offered more than 2,000 items of condolence to comfort the troops entering Tibet and the Volunteer Army. Recently, after the increase production and practice economy movement was launched, Tibetan compatriots also joined the movement. Lamas from the Rikou Temple and Gesang Temple in Kangding also organized themselves to collect rhubarb and fritillary bulbs, chop firewood, cut grass, and reclaim wasteland for production. This phenomenon has never happened before.

    When we arrived in Ganzi and Yulong, Li Chunfang, Vice Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, and the heads of the Ganzi County Government and the garrison, the living Buddhas of the temples, etc., ran several miles to welcome us. Young Tibetan men and women all wore the latest ethnic costumes and squeezed forward to offer us hadas. They kept shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" in their mouths. Lamas and primary school students from Ganzi Temple danced yak dances, green lion dances, and Yangko dances to welcome us. Bagga, the daughter of Vice Chairman Xia Ke Daodeng, and her niece Qianjia, as well as their relatives and friends, were waiting for us on the road long before we arrived. They danced the Halo Laiyin dance (Ba'an string dance) and followed us for more than a mile. At the report meeting, we received more than sixty hadas from Tibetan compatriots, as well as precious musk, cordyceps, ginseng, and various animal skins. After our report, a Tibetan compatriot immediately pulled the translator and told me: "Do you need yaks? I can support you." The enthusiasm of the masses made us feel like we were meeting relatives we hadn't seen for a long time.

    康藏高原的人民在支持我们
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西南分团　裴光
    我们以无限兴奋的心情，从成都进入了祖国辽阔而富饶的康藏高原。在这里，我们更深刻地体会到我们祖国的伟大和美好。
    我们看到了雅砻江两岸肥沃的青稞田。看到了玉隆附近可以牧千万头牦牛的草地和原始森林。看见了康藏高原名贵的土产麝香、鹿茸、虫草、红花、羚羊角和各种各样的兽皮。还听人介绍了蕴藏在高原上的丰富的矿产——金沙江流域的金，同普、德格的铜和盐，宁静山脉的石油等。
    我们会见了身材高大、勇敢而勤劳的藏族同胞，会晤了战斗在拔海四、五千公尺的高原上，“逢山开山，逢水架桥，没有粮食就开荒生产”的进藏英雄部队。
    七天中，我们除了向进藏部队和藏族同胞报告朝鲜前线的作战情况外，还访问了藏族同胞的家庭，并慰问了在康藏高原上积劳成疾和在修建中英勇负伤的解放军同志们。
    这里共有二十个县。除泸定多汉人，九龙为彝族人民聚居地区外，其他都是藏族人民聚居地区。中央人民政府把这里划为西康省的藏族自治区。全区所属各县，都召开过各族各界人民代表会议，成立了藏族自治政府或民族民主联合政府。少数民族第一次当家作了主人。他们欢欣地说：“我们少数民族翻身了。过去，我们只有完粮、纳税、支‘乌拉’（即支差）的资格；现在在毛主席领导下，能到人民政府办事，真正当主人了。”
    各民族之间出现了空前团结的气象。多年来不能解决的民族之间和各族内部的纠纷，很顺利地解决了。从一九五○年十一月到一九五一年九月，当地人民政府解决了藏族内部纠纷一千五百多件。甘孜孔萨土司和马苏土司，解放前彼此仇杀，出入要带几十个人保镳；现在，经过人民政府调解，彼此订立了团结爱国公约，非常和睦。巴塘县八万茨登和茨郎洛松械斗十二年的“冤家”案件，经人民政府调处后，两方同桌吃饭，同室工作，成为团结模范。这类事情解决得很多，兄弟民族称为“解冤家”。现在大家都要求团结，以团结为荣，争取当团结模范。
    入藏的人民解放军和工作干部，与当地人民建立了亲密的友好团结。藏族人民称他们为“巴色嘉”（新汉人）。许多藏胞和喇嘛，都要求参加人民解放军，要求参加政府工作。康定军分区已经成立了藏民团。甘孜有一个女喇嘛，把衣服卖了做路费，到康定民族学校去参加学习。在康定召开第二次各界人民代表会议时，从德格以南深山里的三岩地方赶来一位藏胞，他背上干粮赶了三十多天路程到康定来见藏族自治区人民政府李春芳副主席，要求政府派两个干部到他们那里去工作。甘孜县许多偏僻地区的牛场牧民，自动赶着牦牛，走几天路程到政府来缴公粮。他们说：“毛主席的政策，处处为了我们少数民族。”有些喇嘛寺把“共同纲领”、“民族政策”当做经典来读。许多寺院的经堂里都挂着毛主席的像，他们把毛主席称做“活菩萨”，经常祈祷：“毛主席万岁万万岁！”
    抗美援朝运动展开后，很快地深入到了边疆的藏胞地区。全区有一半以上的人口受到了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育。他们说：“朝鲜是我们的大门，不能让美国强盗和国民党再来压迫我们，一定要抗美援朝。”他们把最珍贵的土产麝香、鹿茸、藏红花、虫草和兽皮拿出来捐献。贫苦的牧民、农民，把牛羊毛捻成毛线捐献，把青稞麦捐献。去年全区捐献了一门高射炮。康定县人民并写了七千封慰问信，献出二千多件慰问品，慰劳进藏部队和志愿军。最近增产节约运动展开后，藏族同胞也卷入了这一运动。康定日库寺和格桑寺的喇嘛，也组织起来采挖大黄、贝母，砍柴，割草，开荒生产。这种现象在过去是从来没有的。
    我们到达甘孜和玉隆两地时，西康省藏族自治区李春芳副主席和甘孜县政府、驻军的首长，寺院活佛等都跑出几里路来欢迎我们。藏族青年男女都穿上了最新的民族服；挤着向我们献哈达。嘴里不住地喊着“毛主席万岁”。甘孜寺的喇嘛和甘孜小学生跳着牦牛舞、青狮舞和秧歌舞来欢迎我们。夏克刀登副主席的女儿八嘎和侄女茜嘉以及她们的亲友，早在我们来到之前，就在大路上等着我们。他们跳着哈洛来茵舞（巴安弦子），跟着我们走了一里多路。在报告会上，我们收到了藏族同胞送给的哈达有六十多条，还有珍贵的麝香、虫草、人参和各种兽皮。有一位藏胞在我们报告后，马上拉着翻译告诉我：“你们需不需要牦牛？我可以支援你们。”群众的热情，使我们像会见了许久不见的亲人一样。
