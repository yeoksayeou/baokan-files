Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th—On April 3rd, the "Investigation Group on U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" held a symposium at a certain location on the front lines to investigate the crimes of U.S. imperialist germ warfare. In addition to the members of the investigation group, participants included representatives from the leadership organs and various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, members of the Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team, and witnesses from the Volunteer Army who had witnessed the crimes of U.S. imperialist germ warfare, totaling more than 200 people. Lu Zhenhan, Vice Minister of Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Alan Winnington, reporter for the British Daily Worker, were also invited to participate.

In her speech, Head of the Delegation Li Dequan stated that the investigation group had achieved great results in a very short period of time and expressed her gratitude to all the members of the Volunteer Army for their deep concern and strong assistance to the investigation group. Head of the Delegation Li Dequan particularly praised the outstanding fighting spirit shown by the Volunteer Army soldiers in the anti-germ warfare struggle. She said: The germ-laden insects and poisons massively spread by U.S. imperialism in Korea since January 28 this year have been wiped out through the concerted efforts of the heroic Korean and Chinese people. This is the victory of the first round of our struggle against U.S. imperialist germ warfare. She finally hoped that the Chinese and Korean people would achieve one brilliant victory after another in the long-term and arduous struggle against U.S. imperialism's germ warfare, and completely defeat U.S. imperialism's germ warfare.

Vice Head of the Delegation Liao Chengzhi gave a detailed report on the investigation of U.S. imperialist germ warfare crimes at the meeting. He said: "We have now mastered a large amount of materials and evidence, and we will use this to accuse U.S. imperialism of its heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare to the people of the world, and appeal to the people of the world to vigorously support the Chinese and Korean military and civilians standing at the forefront of opposing the evil germ warfare and defending world peace, because the victory of the Chinese and Korean people is also the victory of the people of the world."

Wei Xi, deputy captain of the Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team and a bacteriology expert, Zeng Zhaolun, a member of the investigation group and a chemical expert, Li Zongen, a tropical disease expert, Yu Huanwen, an epidemiology expert, and Shen Dinghong, a bacteriology expert, all pointed out in their speeches, based on the results of investigations and tests, that the appearance of large numbers of insects on the snow in temperatures of eight or nine degrees below zero to ten degrees, with a certain length, width, and density of spread, and the discovery of many different kinds of insects mixed together, proved that these insects were by no means naturally occurring. The discovery of piles of dead fish on the mountains was even more sufficient to prove that they were dropped by aircraft. After testing, the insects, small animals, and poisonous materials spread by these aircraft were found to contain deadly germs such as plague, typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera, most of which were artificially cultivated. Coupled with other material and human evidence, everything proves that U.S. imperialism's conduct of germ warfare is undeniable. They unanimously protested the crazy crimes of U.S. imperialism and called on all conscientious medical and health workers and scientists in the world to rise up and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. Wang Zizhong, a member of the investigation group and a representative of the Christian community, called on all kind-hearted Christians in the world to unite and stop the inhumane germ warfare being waged by U.S. imperialism in Korea and China.

After representatives of various units of the Volunteer Army reported on the situation of U.S. aircraft spreading poisonous insects and substances in the areas where their units were stationed, witnesses from the Volunteer Army who had personally seen enemy aircraft spreading bacteria angrily denounced the shameless crimes of the American aggressors at the meeting. A total of twenty-seven witnesses attended the meeting, including assistant doctor Han Lutao, cultural instructor Qi Dengshen, staff officer Wang Peikun, logistics staff member Chen Guanghan, who witnessed enemy aircraft dropping bacterial bombs, platoon leader Zheng Yinrong, who witnessed enemy aircraft spreading germ-carrying flies, communicator Shang Zhongyi, who had germ-carrying insects land on his body, and deputy director of the health station Li Qinghua, who witnessed enemy aircraft dropping a white gelatinous substance containing snow fleas. After reporting on the scene of seeing enemy aircraft dropping bacterial bombs, assistant doctor Han Lutao said: "We have brought this shell and handed it over to the investigation group so that the people of the motherland and the world can see the evidence of U.S. imperialism's crimes. I want to ask the investigation group to tell the people of the motherland and the world that our Chinese and Korean people's army will not be intimidated by U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. We must give the enemy an even heavier blow, and we have the confidence to defeat the enemy's germ warfare!"

General Hong Xuezhi, representative of the leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, expressed his condolences and gratitude to the investigation group for their hard work on behalf of all commanders and combatants of the Volunteer Army. He said: The germ warfare waged by American aggressors in Korea and China can only arouse the Chinese and Korean armies to hate the American aggressors even more strongly. All their heinous and vicious tricks can only end in a more disastrous defeat. Wu Wenli, Minister of Health of the Volunteer Army, expressed his heartfelt respect and gratitude to all members of the investigation group and all members of the epidemic prevention and inspection team working in Korea on behalf of all medical workers of the Volunteer Army.

Lu Zhenhan, Vice Minister of Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also spoke at the meeting. After listing the crimes of U.S. imperialist germ warfare, he said: "U.S. imperialism's attempt to conquer the Korean nation with barbaric germ warfare is completely wishful thinking. The Korean people are extremely strong, especially the Korean people who have been tempered by nearly two years of arduous war. Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung and with the support of the Chinese people and the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, they will definitely defeat U.S. imperialism's germ warfare!"

Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British Daily Worker, said that he had collected a lot of evidence about U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. He said he would definitely tell the people of the world about this evidence. He said: "I am convinced that the germ warfare waged by U.S. imperialism is bound to fail. On behalf of the progressive people of Britain, I thank the heroic Chinese and Korean people, because your heroic struggle against germ warfare and in defense of world peace is also for the sake of the British people."

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”在朝鲜前线
    与志愿军各部代表及见证人举行座谈会
    发言者一致控诉美国侵略者撒布带菌毒物的罪行
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】四月三日“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”在前线某地举行调查美帝国主义细菌战罪行的座谈会。参加会议的除调查团人员外，尚有中国人民志愿军领导机关和各部的代表、抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队队员及志愿军中目击美帝国主义细菌战罪行的见证人等共二百多人。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省副相卢振汉和英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿也被邀参加。
    李德全团长在讲话中说明调查团在很短时间内获得了很大收获，并对志愿军全体人员给予调查团的深切关怀和大力协助表示感谢。李德全团长特别赞扬了志愿军战士们在反细菌战斗争中所表现的卓越的战斗精神。她说：美帝国主义自今年一月二十八日以来在朝鲜大量撒布的带细菌的毒虫和毒物，在英勇的朝中人民的一致努力下已被扑灭，这是我们反对美帝国主义细菌战的第一个回合的胜利。她最后希望中朝人民在反对美帝国主义进行细菌战的长期的、艰苦的斗争中取得一个又一个的辉煌胜利，彻底打败美帝国主义的细菌战。
    廖承志副团长在会上作了美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查的详细报告。他说：“我们现在已经掌握了大量的材料和证据，我们将以此向全世界人民控告美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行，向世界人民呼吁大力支援站在反对罪恶的细菌战、保卫世界和平最前列的中朝军民，因为中朝人民的胜利也就是全世界人民的胜利。”
    抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队副队长、细菌学专家魏曦，调查团团员、化学专家曾昭抡，热带病学专家李宗恩，流行病学专家俞焕文和细菌学专家沈鼎鸿等五人在讲话中都根据调查和化验的结果一致指出：在零下八、九度到十几度的气温下，在雪地上出现大批昆虫，其撒布面积具有一定长度、宽度和密度，且发现很多种类完全不相同的昆虫混杂在一起，证明这些昆虫绝非自然发生。至于山上发现成堆的死鱼，就更足以证明是飞机所投。这些飞机撒布的昆虫、小动物及带毒物品，经检验后发现有鼠疫、伤寒、痢疾、霍乱等致命性的毒菌，其中大部又经人工培养而成。加上其他的物证、人证，一切都证明美帝国主义进行细菌战是无法抵赖的。他们一致抗议美帝国主义的疯狂罪行，并号召全世界有良心的医药卫生工作者、科学家起来为反对美帝国主义的细菌战作坚决斗争。调查团团员、基督教界代表王梓仲在讲话中呼吁全世界一切善良的基督教徒，一致起来制止美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行的违反人道的细菌战。
    在志愿军各部代表报告美国飞机在各该部驻区撒布毒虫、毒物的情况后，志愿军中曾亲眼看见敌机撒布细菌的见证人在会上愤怒控诉美国侵略者的无耻罪行。到会的见证人共有二十七名，发言的有目击敌机投下细菌炸弹的助理医生韩鲁涛、文化教员祁登绅、参谋王培坤、后勤工作人员陈光寒，曾目击敌机撒布带菌苍蝇的排长郑银荣，在身上落有带菌昆虫的通信员尚忠益，曾目击敌机投下内含雪蚤的白色胶状物的卫生所副所长李庆华等十一人。助理医生韩鲁涛在报告了亲眼看见的敌机投掷细菌弹的情形以后说：“我们已把这个弹壳带来交给调查团了，让祖国和全世界人民都能看到美帝国主义的罪证。我要请调查团转告给祖国和全世界人民，我们中朝人民军队是不会被美帝国主义的细菌战吓倒的，我们一定要给敌人更沉重的打击，我们有信心打败敌人的细菌战！”
    中国人民志愿军领导机关代表洪学智将军代表志愿军全体指挥员战斗员对调查团的辛苦工作表示慰问和感谢。他说：美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战，只能激起朝中军队更加强烈地仇恨美国侵略者。它们一切穷凶极恶的毒辣伎俩，只能以更惨重的失败而告终。志愿军卫生部长吴文理在讲话中代表志愿军全体医务工作者对调查团全体人员及在朝工作的防疫检验队全体人员表示了衷心的敬意和感谢。
    在会上讲话的还有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保健省副相卢振汉。他在列述美帝国主义细菌战的罪行以后说：“美帝国主义企图以野蛮的细菌战来征服朝鲜民族，完全是妄想。朝鲜人民是坚强无比的，特别是经过了近两年艰苦战争锻炼的朝鲜人民，在金日成将军的领导下，在中国人民及以苏联为首的全世界和平阵营的支援之下，一定能打败美帝国主义的细菌战！”
    英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿说，他已搜集了很多关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的证据。他表示一定把这些证据告诉全世界人民。他说：“我深信美帝国主义所进行的细菌战是一定要失败的。我代表英国进步人民感谢英勇的中朝人民，因为你们为反对细菌战和保卫世界和平所作的英勇斗争也是为了英国人民。”
