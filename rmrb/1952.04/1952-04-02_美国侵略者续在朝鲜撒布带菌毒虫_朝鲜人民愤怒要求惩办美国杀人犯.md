Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st: The American imperialists, completely disregarding the standards of international law and moral principles, continue to spread germ-carrying insects in northern Korea. For example, they dropped germ-carrying insects near Linan Village (transliteration) in Dalao Township, Anju County, South Pyongan Province. Li Enren (transliteration), the head of the Anju County Health Bureau, told a reporter from the Korean Central News Agency that the insects were dropped about 200 meters away from the village, and the county has immediately taken measures to exterminate the dropped insects.

Because the epidemic prevention team, with the support of the local people, immediately exterminated the germ-carrying fleas, lice, and bedbugs spread by American aircraft in Korea, the interventionists are now beginning to spread germ-carrying earthworms, snails, and butterfly larvae.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, Wonsan: American aircraft dropped germ-carrying insects in residential areas and surrounding areas of Wonsan City on the evening of March 18th. Many insects were found on the snow in the areas of Wuncheng Village (transliteration), Xinning Village (transliteration), Xinxing Village (transliteration), and Sancheol Village (transliteration). Residents of Wonsan said that these kinds of insects had never been found in this season in Korea in previous years. The local epidemic prevention team immediately began to exterminate these insects.

The Korean people are angrily protesting the terrifying atrocities of the American beasts who are attempting to destroy the freedom-loving Korean people. Protest rallies are being held all over the country, demanding punishment for the American murderers.

The "National Salvation Front" newspaper published an article entitled "A Disgraceful End Awaits the American Devils Who Attempt to Destroy Humanity with Bacteriological Weapons." The article wrote: Neither bombs, nor air fortresses, nor poison gas, can do anything but increase our people's hatred of American imperialism. The American imperialists vainly attempt to use bacteriological warfare to intimidate us. The more rampant the enemy becomes, the more determined we become. Those who vainly attempt to destroy our people will themselves be destroyed. The article concluded with a call: Use all our strength to crush Truman's bacteriological warfare! Eliminate the American murderers!

    美国侵略者续在朝鲜撒布带菌毒虫
    朝鲜人民愤怒要求惩办美国杀人犯
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十八日讯：美帝国主义者完全不顾国际法的标准和道德原则，继续在朝鲜北部撒布带菌毒虫。例如他们曾在平安南道安州郡大老面利南里（译音）附近投下带菌毒虫。安州郡卫生局长李恩仁（译音）告诉朝鲜中央通讯社记者：毒虫是在离该村约二百公尺远的地方投下的，该郡已立即采取措施，扑灭投下的毒虫。
    由于防疫队在当地人民的支持下，立即扑灭了美国飞机在朝鲜境内撒布的带菌跳蚤、虱子和臭虫，干涉者现在开始撒布带菌的蚯蚓、蜗牛和蝴蝶幼虫。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社元山讯：美国飞机于三月十八日晚间在元山城内住宅区和附近地区投下带菌毒虫。云城里（译音）、新宁里（译音）、新兴里（译音）和三哲里（译音）地区雪上发现许多毒虫。元山居民说：朝鲜往年的这个季节从来没有发现过这种毒虫。当地防疫队立即开始扑灭这些毒虫。
    朝鲜人民愤怒抗议企图毁灭爱好自由的朝鲜人民的美国野兽的恐怖暴行。全国各地都在举行抗议大会，要求惩办美国杀人犯。
    “救国前线”报刊载了一篇题为“可耻的下场正在等待着企图用细菌武器毁灭人类的美国魔鬼”的文章。这篇文章写道：不管炸弹也罢，空中堡垒也罢，毒气也罢，都只能使我国人民增加对美帝国主义的仇恨。美帝国主义者妄想用细菌战吓倒我们。敌人愈加猖狂，我们就愈加坚定。妄想毁灭我国人民的人自己一定会被消灭的。这篇文章最后号召：用一切力量粉碎杜鲁门的细菌战！消灭美国杀人犯！
