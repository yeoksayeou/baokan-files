    The Soviet Union's Fifth Post-War Price Reduction
    The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) recently issued a decision to once again reduce state retail prices for food, effective April 1st. This is the fifth post-war price reduction in the Soviet Union. This decision reflects the further prosperity of the Soviet socialist national economy and demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system.
    The further reduction of state retail prices for food in the Soviet Union is a direct result of the Soviet working people engaging in peaceful labor with boundless enthusiasm and exceeding the national economic development plan in many respects. In completing the production of the 1951 national economic plan, the Soviet working people further increased labor productivity and reduced the cost of industrial production. In 1951, Soviet industrial production increased by 16 percent compared to 1950, and nearly two-thirds of this was the result of increased labor productivity. At the same time, the Soviet working people also achieved brilliant achievements in reducing production costs in 1951. The funds saved in industrial production alone exceeded 26 billion rubles, but the money saved by reducing wholesale prices of raw materials and materials was not included. Increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs are the principles of economy in socialist production. Precisely because the Soviet working people resolutely implement this principle, the Soviet national economy can develop by leaps and bounds, creating conditions for repeated price reductions.
    The real income of Soviet workers and peasants in 1951 increased by 10 percent compared to 1950, and this further reduction in food retail prices will inevitably further increase the real income of workers and peasants and make their material lives richer and better. This is in stark contrast to the increasingly miserable living conditions of the working people in capitalist countries under the influence of arms expansion and war preparation. In the recent 1952-1953 fiscal budget proposed by the British Conservative government, while increasing military spending, it cut food subsidies to stabilize food prices by 160 million pounds, accounting for one-third of the original total, causing prices to rise and further lowering the living standards of the working people. The situation is the same in the United States and other capitalist countries in Western Europe. This cannot but make the working people of the world increasingly envious of the Soviet socialist system and its peaceful policies, and more hateful of capitalism and its evil consequences of arms expansion and war preparation.

### 苏联战后第五次减低物价

    苏联战后第五次减低物价
    苏联部长会议和联共（布）中央委员会最近颁布决定，自四月一日起再次减低食品的国家零售价格。这是苏联战后第五次减低物价。这一决定反映了苏联社会主义国家经济的进一步繁荣，并显示出社会主义经济制度的无比优越。
    苏联食品国家零售价格的再次减低，是苏联劳动人民以无限的热情从事和平劳动，在许多方面超额完成发展国民经济计划的直接结果。苏联劳动人民在完成一九五一年国民经济计划的生产中，进一步提高了劳动生产率，并减低了工业生产的成本。一九五一年苏联的工业生产比一九五○年增加了百分之十六，而其中将近三分之二是提高劳动生产率的结果。同时，一九五一年苏联劳动人民在减低生产成本方面也取得了辉煌的成就，仅工业生产方面节省下来的资金就在二百六十亿卢布以上，但是由于减低原料和材料批发价格而节省下来的钱还没有计算在内。提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本是社会主义生产的节约原则，正因为苏联劳动人民坚决地实现了这个原则，因而苏联的国民经济就能够飞跃地向前发展，并为一再减低物价创造了条件。
    苏联工人和农民的实际收入在一九五一年已较一九五○年增加了百分之十，而这次食物零售价格的再次减低，就必然使工人和农民的实际收入进一步增加，并使他们的物质生活更加富裕美好。这和资本主义国家劳动人民在扩军备战影响下日益悲惨的生活状况，恰成一个鲜明的对照。英国保守党政府最近提出的一九五二——一九五三年度的财政预算中，在增加军费的同时却削减了稳定食物价格的食物津贴一亿六千万镑，占原来总数的三分之一，而使物价上涨，劳动人民的生活水平更为降低。在美国和西欧其他资本主义国家，情形也是一样的。这就使全世界的劳动人民不能不日益羡慕苏联的社会主义制度与和平政策，而更加仇恨资本主义及其扩军备战的恶果。
