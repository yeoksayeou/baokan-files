    Yanggao County, Chahar Province, Holds Expanded Production Meeting
    Concentrated on Solving the Leadership Problem of Carrying out the Patriotic Production Increase Competition
    From April 7th to 10th, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, held an expanded production meeting. The meeting was very successful and focused on resolving the leadership issues in launching the patriotic production increase competition. More than 2,000 people attended the meeting, including county, district, and village cadres, as well as labor models and mutual aid team leaders. Yang Gengtian, Chairman of the People's Government of Chahar Province, personally guided the meeting in Yanggao.
    The main success of this meeting was the concretization of the task of increasing yield per unit area. Farmers in Yanggao County mainly grow millet, sorghum, and potatoes. After discussion, everyone clearly recognized that Yanggao should focus on increasing the yield of these three crops, requiring an increase of 20 percent per mu for dry land compared to normal years, and an increase of 30 percent for irrigated land. The village cadres, labor models, and mutual aid team leaders who attended the meeting also held group meetings based on this requirement and the specific circumstances to formulate practical and feasible production increase plans for their respective villages. When formulating the plans, the cadres leading the meeting paid attention to correcting the purely task-oriented view of some village cadres who blindly compiled plans in order to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities, and also corrected the deviation of some village cadres who did not sufficiently understand the significance of patriotic production increase and set the planned output very low. After careful research, the meeting decided that the county should cultivate twelve high-yield villages, fifty-nine high-yield groups, and four hundred and fifty high-yield households this year. The yield per unit area of these high-yield villages, groups, and households should be increased by another 20 to 50 percent on top of the above requirements. In this way, this year's production increase task for the whole county was specifically implemented down to the group and household, thereby laying a solid mass foundation for the realization of this task.
    The meeting also discussed and resolved many key issues for increasing production. Everyone believed that the first key issue was the development and improvement of mutual aid teams. Yanggao County already has 2,300 mutual aid teams. The meeting required that another 2,613 be developed this year, and that 910 of them be able to persist in year-round mutual aid. The county also decided to select 355 groups with a better foundation to strengthen leadership and education, and develop them into mutual aid teams that combine agriculture and sideline occupations, so as to steadily develop into agricultural production cooperatives in the future. To this end, the meeting called on Party members, Youth League members, and activists in rural areas to take the lead in raising the level of mutual aid teams, in order to promote the patriotic production increase movement. The amount of fertilizer applied to farmland throughout Yanggao County this year has increased compared to last year. The meeting called on everyone not to be complacent, to mobilize farmers to open up sources of fertilizer as soon as possible, and to prepare for topdressing to ensure that topdressing is generally applied once when crops are flowering and bearing fruit. The meeting also called on everyone to promote the farming experience of Chi Wanku, a high-yield model in Yanggao County.
    The meeting decided to establish a cadre responsibility system for leading production: special personnel will be dispatched to lead each high-yield village and high-yield household; the county head and the secretary of the Yanggao County Committee of the Communist Party of China will each lead the production of one village, in order to gain experience in leading the production increase movement and guide the whole county; all 400 cadres participating in leading production in the county will be assigned responsibility areas to strengthen leadership. In addition, the meeting, based on everyone's reflection that farmers still have some difficulties during spring plowing and sowing, specifically decided that the county people's government will lend another 150,000 jin of fine fertilizer, 150,000 jin of seeds, and 2,000 iron shovels to support farmers' spring plowing and sowing. The meeting also rewarded the tenth district, Zhang Guantun, Nan Shui Di and other six villages, Ma Jiang, Liang Yingcheng, Cui Er Hai and other seven mutual aid teams, and eighteen model cadres leading production who won the spring plowing and drought prevention campaign. At the meeting, an award ceremony was held for the provincial government's forwarding of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government's award to Chi Wanku, an agricultural high-yield model in Taishizhuang. The cadres attending the meeting all believed that after this meeting, everyone's thinking was clear, the policies were affirmed, and the confidence in increasing production was enhanced.

    察哈尔省阳高县召开扩大生产会议
    集中解决开展爱国增产竞赛的领导问题
    察哈尔省阳高县从四月七日到十日召开了一次扩大生产会议，这次会议开得很成功，集中解决了开展爱国增产竞赛运动的领导问题。参加会议的有县、区、村干部和劳动模范、互助组组长共两千多人，察哈尔省人民政府主席杨耕田在阳高亲自指导了这次会议。
    这次会议成功的主要一点，是把提高单位面积产量的任务具体化了。阳高县农民以种谷子、高粱和马铃薯为主，经讨论后，大家明确地认识了，阳高应以提高上述三种作物的产量为重点，要求每亩旱地比常年增产百分之二十，水浇地增产百分之三十。参加会议的各村村干部、劳动模范和互助组长，并根据这个要求和具体情况，分别开小组会，订出了各村的切实可行的增产计划。在订计划的时候，领导会议的干部注意纠正了某些村干部为了完成上级任务而盲目编计划的单纯任务观点，也纠正了某些村干部对爱国增产的意义认识不足而把计划产量订得很低的偏向。会议又经过缜密研究之后，决定全县今年要培养十二个丰产村，五十九个丰产组，四百五十个丰产户。这些丰产村、组、户的单位面积产量，又应比上述要求再提高百分之二十到五十。这样，全县今年的增产任务便具体地贯彻到了组和户，从而为实现这个任务打下了结实的群众基础。
    会议还讨论和解决了许多增产的关键问题。大家认为：第一个关键问题是发展和提高互助组。阳高全县已有二千三百个互助组，会议要求今年再发展二千六百一十三个，并要求其中九百一十个能够坚持长年互助。全县还决定选择三百五十五个基础较好的组，加强领导教育，发展为农业副业相结合的互助组，以便将来稳步地发展为农业生产合作社。为此，会议号召农村中的党员、团员和积极分子带头，把互助组提高一步，以便推动爱国增产运动。今年阳高全县农田的施肥量都比去年提高，会议号召大家不要自满，及早发动农民开辟肥源，准备追肥，保证在庄稼扬花结实时，普遍施追肥一次。会议并号召大家推广阳高县丰产模范池万库的耕作经验。
    会议决定建立干部领导生产的责任制：各丰产村和丰产户派专人领导；县长和中共阳高县委会书记各领导一个村的生产，以便取得领导增产运动的经验，指导全县；全县参加领导生产的四百名干部都划定责任区，加强领导。另外，会议根据大家反映农民在春耕下种时还有若干困难，特决定由县人民政府再贷放细肥十五万斤、种籽十五万斤和铁锨两千张，支援农民春耕播种。会议并奖励了在春耕防旱运动中获得优胜的第十区、张官屯、南水地等六个村，马江、梁应成、崔二孩等七个互助组和十八个领导生产的模范干部。会上并曾举行省府转发中央人民政府农业部对太师庄农业丰产模范池万库奖励的授奖仪式。与会干部都认为：开过这次会，大家思想明确，政策肯定，提高了增产的信心。
