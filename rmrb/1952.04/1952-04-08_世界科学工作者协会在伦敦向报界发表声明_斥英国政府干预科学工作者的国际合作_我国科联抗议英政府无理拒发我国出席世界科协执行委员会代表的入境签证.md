Xinhua News Agency, 6th: London dispatch: The World Federation of Scientific Workers issued the following statement to the press in London on March 14th:

    The World Federation of Scientific Workers proposed to hold a meeting of the Executive Committee at Madingley Hall, Cambridge, on March 22nd and 23rd. The British Home Office has now informed the Federation that it will not issue entry visas to foreign members of the Executive Committee, nor will they be allowed to enter the United Kingdom to attend the meeting.

    The World Federation of Scientific Workers is composed of sixteen scientific worker organizations from fourteen countries – including the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, France, and India. It was founded six years ago at the initiative of the British Association of Scientific Workers and is one of the non-governmental international organizations recognized by the United Nations. Its representatives have participated in several committees and meetings of the United Nations. The Federation is the only international scientific worker organization concerned with the economic and social conditions of scientific workers.

    The President of the Federation and Chairman of the Executive Committee is Professor Joliot-Curie. The Vice-Presidents of the Federation are Nobel Prize winner Professor Powell of the University of Bristol and Professor Pauling of the University of California.

    In addition to Professor Joliot-Curie, those scheduled to attend this meeting included Dr. Piégay of France, Academician Nikitin, a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Madame Nikitina, Professor Lebedev, Chairman of the Soviet Higher Education and Scientific Workers Union, Olaevsky, Professor Qian Sanqiang and Dr. Ji Jinren of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, Professor Infeld and Professor Kuligowski of the Polish Scientific Society Federation, Professor Marek of the Czechoslovak Scientific Workers Association, as well as representatives from India, the United Kingdom, and British Dominions.

    The Executive Committee has approximately twenty members, and its work is entirely internal and related to the administrative work of the Federation. The British government's refusal to allow foreign members of the Executive Committee to attend the Executive Committee is an interference in the international cooperation of scientific workers, and therefore a serious blow to the promotion of mutual understanding among the people of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies has lodged a serious protest against the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to our representatives to attend the World Federation of Scientific Workers Executive Committee meeting. The protest letter is as follows:

    The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Scientific Workers is scheduled to hold its eleventh meeting in Cambridge on March 22nd and 23rd of this year. The British government used the despicable means of refusing to issue entry visas to obstruct our representatives Qian Sanqiang and Ji Jinren, as well as representatives from other countries, from attending, preventing the meeting from being held. Our association expresses serious protest against this unreasonable behavior. We believe that this action by the British government is an act of interference in the freedom of assembly and the strengthening of close cooperation within the world's scientific community, and at the same time, it is an act of sabotage against the normal exchanges between people of all countries to increase mutual understanding. Especially today, when American aggressors are conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare, this unreasonable behavior by the British government only further proves that it is afraid that Chinese scientists will reveal the truth about the recent brutal crimes of American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China to the world's righteous scientists and the British people. We are deeply convinced that such despicable means by the British government are completely futile and cannot stop the efforts of scientists around the world to strengthen unity and cooperation, nor can they cover up the heinous crimes of American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare. All righteous scientists around the world will unite more closely and resolutely struggle to safeguard scientific cooperation and to stop the heinous crimes of imperialists using science to conduct bacteriological warfare.

                                         April 4, 1952

### 世界科学工作者协会在伦敦向报界发表声明  斥英国政府干预科学工作者的国际合作  我国科联抗议英政府无理拒发我国出席世界科协执行委员会代表的入境签证

    世界科学工作者协会在伦敦向报界发表声明
    斥英国政府干预科学工作者的国际合作
    我国科联抗议英政府无理拒发我国出席世界科协执行委员会代表的入境签证
    【新华社六日讯】伦敦消息：世界科学工作者协会于三月十四日在伦敦向报界发表声明如下：
    世界科学工作者协会曾提议于三月二十二、二十三日在剑桥麦丁莱大厦举行执行委员会会议。英国内政部现已通知协会说，它不发入境签证给执行委员会的外籍执行委员，也不允许他们进入英国参加会议。
    世界科学工作者协会是由十四国——包括英国、美国、苏联、中国、法国、印度——的十六个科学工作者团体组成的。它于六年前在英国科学工作者协会的倡议下成立，是联合国所承认的非政府的国际组织之一。它的代表曾参加联合国的若干委员会和会议。协会是唯一关心科学工作者的经济和社会条件的国际科学工作者组织。
    协会主席和执行委员会主席是约里奥—居里教授。协会副主席有：诺贝尔奖金得奖人、布利斯托尔大学教授鲍威尔和加利福尼亚大学教授包林。
    原定要参加这次会议的除了约里奥—居里教授外，有法国的皮加博士，苏联科学院主席团委员尼基丁院士，尼基丁娜夫人，苏联高等学校和科学工作者工会主席列别捷夫教授，奥拉伊夫斯基，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会的钱三强教授和计晋仁博士，波兰科学学会联合会的英费尔德教授和库利戈夫斯基教授，捷克斯洛伐克科学工作者协会马列克教授，以及印度、英国和英属各自治领的代表。
    执行委员会约有二十位委员，它处理的工作都是内部的工作，而且关系于协会的行政工作。英国政府拒绝外籍执行委员参加执行委员会，就是干预科学工作者的国际合作，因此也就是对增进各国人民相互谅解的一个严重打击。
    【新华社六日讯】中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会，对英国政府拒发入境签证给我代表前往英国出席世界科学工作者协会执行委员会会议事提出严重抗议，抗议书如下：
    世界科学工作者协会执行委员会定于本年三月二十二、二十三日在剑桥召开第十一次会议。英国政府用不发入境签证的卑劣手段，阻挠我国代表钱三强、计晋仁及其他各国代表前往出席，使会议未能举行。本会对于这一无理行为，表示严重的抗议。我们认为英国政府的这一举动，是对于世界科学界自由集会，加强密切合作的干涉行为，同时是对各国人民间正常来往增加互相了解的破坏行为。特别在美国侵略者大规模进行细菌战的今天，英国政府这一无理行为只更证明了它害怕中国科学家把美国侵略者最近在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的残暴罪行的真相公布于世界正义科学家代表和英国人民的面前。我们深信：英国政府这种卑劣手段完全是徒然的，并阻止不住全世界科学家加强团结与合作的努力，也掩盖不住美国侵略者进行细菌战的万恶罪行。全世界一切正义的科学家将更加团结，为维护科学合作，为制止帝国主义者利用科学进行细菌战的滔天罪行而坚决奋斗。
                                         一九五二年四月四日
