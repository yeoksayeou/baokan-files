Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 23rd: The United Nations Human Rights Commission held its eighth session in New York, discussing the drafting of an international covenant on human rights. The attempt by the United States, Britain, and other colonial powers to obstruct the Human Rights Commission from formulating clauses on the right to self-determination for all peoples and nations met with a shameful defeat.

The discussion on the right to self-determination of all peoples and nations, which has been going on for a week, has revealed a sharp conflict between two lines. The representatives of the Soviet Union and Ukraine, supported by the representatives of Poland, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, India, Chile, and other countries, firmly maintained that the draft international covenant on human rights should include clear provisions for the unconditional recognition and realization of the right to national self-determination for all peoples and nations. The Soviet representative suggested including a clause in the draft international covenant stipulating that all peoples and nations have the right to national self-determination, and that countries responsible for administering non-self-governing territories must promote the realization of this right.

The representatives of countries with colonies and trust territories, headed by the US representative, repeatedly attempted to prevent the inclusion of clauses on the right to self-determination of all peoples and nations in the international covenant. The US representative, Mrs. Roosevelt, had to acknowledge the further development of the national liberation movements in colonial and dependent countries, and therefore did not dare to directly oppose the Soviet proposal, but proposed an "amendment" to the Soviet proposal, stipulating that the exercise of the right to self-determination must comply with so-called constitutional procedures and should fully take into account the rights of other countries and peoples, attempting to use this means to virtually deny the right to self-determination of all peoples and nations.

The Soviet representative, Morozov, exposed this conspiracy of the United States at the meeting and emphasized that the realization of the right to national self-determination conforms to the struggle goals and aspirations of hundreds of millions of people who are still politically and economically enslaved by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and other colonialists. Morozov demanded that the representatives of the Human Rights Commission reject the US "amendment" that violates the interests of colonial and dependent countries. The representatives of Ukraine, Egypt, Lebanon, Pakistan, Chile, and other countries all supported the Soviet proposal. In their speeches, they cited many examples illustrating how countries with colonies and trust territories are doing their best to obstruct oppressed peoples from exercising their right to national self-determination. The Egyptian representative, Azmi, said that the Soviet proposal "reflects the hopes and aspirations of the people of colonial and dependent countries." In the vote, the representatives of the majority of countries voted to reject the US "amendment," and only the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium voted in favor of the US "amendment." Then, the committee passed a resolution based on the Soviet proposal with a large majority of thirteen votes in favor, four votes against, and one abstention.

In addition, the Human Rights Commission also discussed the Chilean proposal. The Chilean proposal required the inclusion of a clause in the international covenant stipulating that the right to self-determination of all peoples must include absolute sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the Chilean proposal at the meeting, and the US representative openly threatened the countries that supported the Chilean proposal, saying that it might cancel the so-called "economic assistance" to them. The Soviet representative spoke in support of the Chilean proposal, pointing out that the US representative's remarks proved that the US's so-called "economic assistance" is a means of politically and economically enslaving other countries. The Chilean proposal was also supported by the representatives of Egypt, Lebanon, Uruguay, Ukraine, Poland, Pakistan, and other countries, and was passed by a majority vote in the vote.

    联合国人权委员会讨论民族自决权问题
    苏联提案获得多数票赞成通过
    美国企图阻挠被压迫民族运用自决权的阴谋遭受惨败
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：联合国人权委员会在纽约举行第八次会议，讨论草拟国际人权公约问题。美、英等殖民国家企图阻挠人权委员会拟定关于各国人民和各民族自决权的条款的企图，遭到了可耻的失败。
    已进行达一周之久的关于各国人民与各民族自决权问题的讨论，表现出二条路线的尖锐冲突。受到波兰、埃及、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩、印度、智利及其他国家代表支持的苏联与乌克兰代表，坚决主张国际人权公约草案应包括关于无条件承认和实现各国人民与各民族的民族自决权的明确条款。苏联代表建议在国际公约草案中列入一条，规定各国人民与各民族都有他们的民族自决权，负责管理非自治领的国家必须促进这种权利的实现。
    以美国代表为首的拥有殖民地和托管领土的国家的代表，一再企图不让国际公约中包括关于各国人民与各民族自决权的条款。美国代表罗斯福夫人不得不承认殖民地国家与附属国民族的解放运动的进一步发展，因而不敢正面反对苏联提案，而对苏联提案提出“修正案”，规定在运用自决权时须遵照所谓宪法程序，并应充分考虑到其他国家和人民的权利，企图用这种手段来实际上否认各国人民和各民族的自决权。
    苏联代表莫罗佐夫在会上揭露了美国这种阴谋，并强调指出，民族自决权的实现，符合于在政治和经济上仍然受美、英、法、比利时和其他殖民主义者奴役的数亿人民的斗争目标和愿望。莫罗佐夫要求人权委员会各代表否决违反殖民地和附属国家利益的美国“修正案”。乌克兰、埃及、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、智利和其他国家代表们都拥护苏联提案，他们在发言中列举许多例子，说明拥有殖民地和托管领土的国家在尽力阻挠被压迫人民运用民族自决权。埃及代表阿兹米说，苏联的建议“反映了殖民地和附属国人民的希望与意愿”。在表决中，大多数国家代表投票拒绝了美国“修正案”，投票赞成美国“修正案”的只有美、英、法、比四国代表。然后，委员会以十三票赞成对四票反对、一票弃权的极大多数通过了以苏联提案为基础的决议。
    此外，人权委员会又讨论了智利的提案。智利提案要求国际公约中列入规定各国人民自决权必须包括对他们的自然财富与资源的绝对主权在内的条款。美、英、法三国代表在会上反对智利提案，美国代表并公然威胁支持智利提案的国家说，可能取消给予它们的所谓“经济援助”。苏联代表发言支持智利提案，指出美国代表的言论证明美国的所谓“经济援助”是在政治上和经济上奴役别国人民的一种手段。智利提案还受到埃及、黎巴嫩、乌拉圭、乌克兰、波兰、巴基斯坦及其他国家代表的支持，在表决中为大多数票所通过。
