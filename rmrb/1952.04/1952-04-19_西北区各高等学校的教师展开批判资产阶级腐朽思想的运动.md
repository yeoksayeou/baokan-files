Following the anti-corruption movement, Northwest University, Northwest Institute of Technology, Northwest Agricultural College, and Northwest Medical College, among other four universities and colleges in the Northwest region, have successively entered the stage of criticizing bourgeois ideology in mid-to-late March. Under the direct leadership of the Northwest Region Higher Education Institutions Teachers' Study Committee, the movement has made preliminary achievements.

During the movement, the schools exposed many facts about bourgeois ideology corrupting students and harming the cause of people's education.

This movement to criticize bourgeois ideology is being carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner under the leadership of the Northwest Region Higher Education Institutions Teachers' Study Committee. In mid-to-late March, the Study Committee sent cadres to various colleges and universities to assist the school's Study Committee branches in their work. First, all schools spent about a week preparing fully, using various meetings to deliberate and discuss, so that the majority of teachers and students recognized the important significance of this ideological struggle. Northwest University first paid attention to promoting democracy. At a forum held by faculty, staff, and student representatives, the school leaders made a preliminary self-criticism, and many teachers raised opinions to them, launching a heated criticism and self-criticism. Then, with a focus on certain teachers in certain departments, they began to criticize bourgeois ideology to play a demonstrative role, and then the entire school展开ed out across all departments. Northwest Agricultural College first had the Communist Party members among the responsible cadres take the lead in making a more profound self-criticism, which enlightened and promoted the general teachers, and first made a demonstrative review in one department to gain experience, and then extended it to the entire school. Northwest Medical College first conducted a review of teaching effectiveness, widely collecting opinions on teachers, and then conducted reviews in batches in a step-by-step manner.

In the ideological struggle of various colleges and universities, the movement proceeded smoothly because the guiding ideology was clear and the masses were fully mobilized, and the democratic atmosphere was unprecedentedly high. With the help of the students, the teachers' bourgeois decadent thoughts were exposed in large quantities, making the majority of teachers realize the serious harm of bourgeois decadent thoughts. They felt that if they did not reform, they would not only fail to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the people and the country and let down the vast number of young students, but also carry the heavy burden of wrong thoughts, unable to make progress. As the students' awareness and demands increased day by day, they would not be able to continue working as before. Therefore, most teachers were willing to participate in the movement and carry out ideological transformation. Among the one hundred and eighteen professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants at Northwest Medical College, more than one hundred voluntarily signed up to be the first to conduct self-criticism. Many teachers at Northwest Agricultural College, including the president, actively sought out comrades from the work group and Party members and Youth League members in the school to solicit their opinions and ask for help in analyzing problems. Many teachers at Northwest University took the initiative to humbly seek opinions from students, revising their self-criticism outlines repeatedly before making public self-criticisms. The students adopted a warm welcome and active assistance attitude towards these teachers who were willing to transform their thinking. In addition to providing materials and opinions from all aspects, they also helped teachers analyze problems. The students of Northwest University organized mutual aid groups, each group helping one teacher. The students of Northwest Medical College held class discussions to help teachers review their teaching effectiveness. The students of Northwest Agricultural College proposed: "We must help teachers carry out ideological transformation with an attitude of being responsible to the people, responsible to the teachers, and responsible to ourselves." When the teachers were conducting self-criticism, the students seriously criticized the teachers' wrong thoughts, and at the same time gave sufficient estimation and affirmation to the teachers' advantages and strengths. Therefore, the teachers deeply felt that the students' attitude was serious and well-intentioned, and the students' requirements were completely reasonable and correct. They felt that they had to reform, and they had no choice but to reform. However, a few teachers did not fully understand the significance of this movement and had not yet considered their own problems well; individual teachers even adopted a resistant attitude. The students raised sharp and solemn criticisms against such teachers.

    西北区各高等学校的教师
    展开批判资产阶级腐朽思想的运动
    在反贪污运动的基础上，西北大学、西北工学院、西北农学院、西北医学院等四校院，已于三月中、下旬先后转入批判资产阶级思想的阶段。在西北区高等学校教师学习委员会的直接领导下，目前运动已获得初步成绩。
    在运动中各校揭露了资产阶级思想腐蚀同学、危害人民教育事业的许多事实。
    这次批判资产阶级思想运动，是在西北区高等学校教师学习委员会的领导下有计划、有步骤地展开的。三月中、下旬，学委会派了干部到各院校去，帮助各校的学委分会进行工作。首先，各校都以一周左右的时间，进行了充分的准备工作，通过各种会议，酝酿讨论，使广大师生认识到这次思想斗争的重要意义。西北大学首先注意了发扬民主，在教职员和学生代表举行的座谈会上，学校的领导人先作了初步的检讨，好多教师向他提出了意见，展开了热烈的批评和自我批评。接着有重点地在某些系的某些教师中开始批判资产阶级思想，起示范作用，然后全校以系为单位，全面展开。西北农学院先由负责干部中的共产党员带头作了比较深刻的检讨，对一般教师起了启发和推动作用，并首先在一个系里作示范性的检讨，取得经验，然后推及全校。西北医学院先进行了教学效果的检查，广泛地搜集了对教师们的意见，然后有步骤地分批进行检讨。
    各院校在思想斗争中，由于领导思想明确，充分地发动了群众，民主空气空前高涨，因此运动的进行是顺利的。在学生们的帮助下，教师们的资产阶级腐朽思想，被大量地揭发出来，使大多数教师认识到资产阶级腐朽思想的严重危害性，感到不改造不但不能完成人民、国家交给的光荣任务，对不起广大的青年学生，而且自己背了错误思想的沉重包袱，不能进步，在学生们的觉悟和要求日益提高的情况下，也将不能照旧工作下去，因此，大多数教师都愿意参加运动，进行思想改造。西北医学院的一百一十八位教授、讲师、助教中，自动报名要求首先进行自我检讨的就有一百人以上；西北农学院的好多教师，包括院长在内，积极地找工作组的同志和学校中的党员和青年团员，征求对自己的意见，要求帮助自己分析问题；西北大学很多教师主动地、虚心地向学生征求意见，在公开检讨前三番两次地修改自己的检讨提纲。对这些愿意改造思想的教师们，学生们采取了热烈欢迎、积极帮助的态度。他们除了从各方面提供材料、意见外，并帮助教师们进行分析。西北大学的同学们，组织了互助组，每组帮助一位教师；西北医学院的同学们分班座谈，帮助教师们检查教学效果。西北农学院学生提出：“我们要抱着对人民负责，对老师负责，对自己负责的态度，帮助老师进行思想改造。”在教师们进行检讨时，同学们一方面严肃地对教师的错误思想提出批判，同时对教师们的优点、长处也给以足够的估计和肯定。因此，教师们深深感觉到同学们的态度是认真严肃的，与人为善的，同学们的要求是完全合理的、正确的。他们感到不能不改造，不得不改造。但有少数教师，对这次运动的意义认识不足，还没有很好地考虑自己的问题；个别教师甚至采取抗拒的态度。对这样的教师，同学们提出了尖锐、严正的批评。
