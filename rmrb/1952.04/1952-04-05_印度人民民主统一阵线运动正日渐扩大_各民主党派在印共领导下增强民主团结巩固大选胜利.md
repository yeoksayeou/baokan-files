Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 1st – The strength and influence of the Indian People's Democratic United Front movement is expanding daily throughout India.

	In Madras Province, the United Democratic Front led by the Communist Party of India has united various parties and groups on the basis of a minimum program that has been readily accepted by workers, peasants, and the general population. A delegation from the United Democratic Front recently traveled to Tamil Nadu (the Tamil-speaking region of Madras Province). This delegation was composed of Ramamurti, a member of the Politburo of the Indian Communist Party, Adityan, leader of the Peasants and Workers Party, and Govindasamy, leader of the Tamil Nadu Labor Party. The local masses warmly welcomed the delegation with rallies or grand receptions. After this trip, Ramamurti told reporters: "Today's democratic forces are developing faster than they did during the general election."

	The situation is the same in Travancore-Cochin, where the left-wing parties' united front led by the Indian Communist Party has become a strong mass organization loved by the people, who see it as a heroic defender of their rights. Due to popular pressure, the orders previously declaring the Communist Party of India and thirty-two people's organizations illegal were revoked on March 24th.

	In West Bengal Province, the democratic alliance formed in the general election later developed into a Joint Citizens' Committee and participated in the elections of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. This Joint Citizens' Committee is composed of the Communist Party of India, the Peasants and Workers Party, the Forward Bloc (Marxist faction), and several democratic parties, groups, and democratic figures.

	In Hyderabad State, the People's Democratic Front has become the most important opposition force in the State Legislative Assembly. Leaders of the Hyderabad People's Democratic Front are now conducting propaganda in the countryside to consolidate the victories already won in the general election.

	In the Mysore State Legislative Assembly, a People's United Front has been formed, including the Communist Party of India, the Peasants and Workers Party, the Indian Socialist Party, the Scheduled Castes Federation, and non-party figures.

	In the United Provinces, democratic forces, responding to the call for unity issued by the Indian Communist Party, laid the foundation for a democratic front at a joint meeting held at the end of February. The meeting established a committee with representatives from the Communist Party of India, the Peasants and Workers Party, the Socialist Party (Left), the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and prominent figures to formulate a minimum program for the democratic front and to consult with other democratic parties and groups intending to join the democratic front. According to a report in the Delhi edition of "The Statesman" on March 21st, the recent meeting of the United Provinces Committee of the Communist Party of India has instructed the county and local party committees to organize democratic front organizations throughout the province. Counties such as Kanpur, Benares, Lucknow, Allahabad, and Azamgarh have already established such fronts. The meeting also passed a resolution stating that the period after the general election is a turning point in the political life of the province—a turning point from competing individually to establishing a unified democratic front movement including workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and patriotic elements among the national bourgeoisie. An increasing number of members of the Socialist Party have seen through the divisive policies of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, and some have already joined the unified democratic front.

	This growing movement of democratic unity among various democratic parties in India is influencing many mass organizations, prompting them to unite as well. The Bengal Committee of the Indian Trade Union Congress and the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress of the All-India Trade Union Congress have made a historically significant decision to merge the former into the latter, and unanimously called on the national organizations of the two organizations to take the same action in other provinces. This measure is a milestone in the struggle for trade union unity in India and an important impetus for the further development of the Indian democratic movement.

	Indian peasant organizations are also taking similar actions to establish a unified front. In Ballia County, United Provinces, the executive bodies of two peasant associations led by the Communist Party of India and the Revolutionary Socialist Party held a joint meeting and decided to dissolve the two organizations and organize a single county peasant association.

    印度人民民主统一阵线运动正日渐扩大
    各民主党派在印共领导下增强民主团结巩固大选胜利
    【新华社新德里一日电】印度人民民主统一阵线运动的力量和影响，正在印度全国各地日渐扩大。
    在马德拉斯省，印度共产党领导的统一民主阵线，已使各党派团体在立即被工人、农民和一般人民欣然接受的最低纲领的基础上团结起来。统一民主阵线的代表团最近曾前往泰米尔纳德（马德拉斯省讲泰米尔话的地区）旅行。这个代表团是由印共政治局委员兰马穆提、农工人民党领袖阿第提安和泰米尔纳德劳动党领袖戈文达撒米组成的。当地群众热诚地举行了集会或盛大的招待会来欢迎代表团。兰马穆提在这次旅行以后告记者说：“今天的民主力量比举行大选时发展得更快。”
    特拉凡哥尔—柯钦邦的情形也是一样，那里印共领导的左翼党派统一阵线已成为强有力的受人民爱戴的群众组织，人民把这个组织看成他们的权利的英勇保卫者。由于人民的压力，过去宣布印度共产党以及三十二个人民组织为非法的命令已在三月二十四日撤销。
    在西孟加拉省，在大选中组成的民主联盟，后来进而组成为联合公民委员会，并参加加尔各答市行政机关的选举。这个联合公民委员会是由印度共产党、农工人民党、前进同盟（马克思主义派）和几个民主党派、团体和民主人士组成的。
    在海得拉巴邦，人民民主阵线已成为邦立法会议中最重要的反对力量。海得拉巴人民民主阵线领袖现在正在乡间进行宣传，巩固在大选中已取得的胜利。
    在买索尔邦立法会议中，包括印度共产党、农工人民党、印度社会党、表列种姓联盟和无党派人士在内的人民统一阵线已经组成。
    在联合省，民主力量响应印共所发出的团结号召，已在二月底举行的一次联席会议上奠定了民主阵线的基础。会议成立了有印度共产党、农工人民党、社会党左派、革命社会党和著名人物代表参加的委员会，以拟订民主阵线的最低纲领，并与打算参加民主阵线的其他民主党派和团体进行磋商。据三月二十一日的德里版“政治家报”报道，印度共产党联合省委员会的最近一次会议已指示各县党委和地方党委，在该省各地组织民主阵线组织。已成立这种阵线的有康波尔、贝拿勒斯、勒克瑙、阿拉哈巴德、阿查姆加尔等县。会议并通过决议说：大选以后的时期是本省政治生活的转折点——从各自竞选进入成立包括工人、农民、中产阶级和民族资产阶级中的爱国分子在内的统一民主阵线运动的转折点。社会党中有愈来愈多的党员已看透社会党右派领袖的分裂政策，有些人并已经参加了统一民主阵线。
    印度各民主党派的这种日益增长的民主团结运动，正在影响着许多群众组织，促使它们也团结起来。印度统一工会大会孟加拉委员会和全印总工会孟加拉省总工会已作出把前者并入后者的具有历史意义的决定，并一致要求这两个组织的全国性机构在其他各省采取同样的行动。这一措施是争取印度工会统一的斗争中的一个里程碑，是印度民主运动的进一步发展的一个重要推动力。
    印度的各农民组织也在采取类似的成立统一阵线的行动。在联合省巴里亚县，印度共产党和革命社会党领导的两个农会的执行机构举行了联席会议，决定解散这两个机构，组织单一的县农会。
