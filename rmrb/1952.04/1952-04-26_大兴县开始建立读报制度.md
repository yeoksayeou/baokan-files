Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions Regarding the People's Daily

    To the Editorial Department: The criticism made by People's Daily reader Yang Lin regarding our county's neglect of political education for cadres is very correct. After reviewing our work, we believe the reason for this phenomenon is primarily because the leading cadres' political awareness is not high, they do not recognize the importance of the Party newspaper, and they pit the central work against newspaper reading work.
    In order to thoroughly correct the above deviation, we have decided to establish a newspaper reading and learning system. Currently, we plan to start improving in the following aspects:
    (1) In each period, formulate outlines for current affairs study based on different situations, specify the key points of study, and organize discussions. (2) Establish an irregular current affairs quiz system. (3) Conduct a rectification of the newspaper reading groups in the offices, and strengthen leadership over the newspaper reading groups.
    In addition, regarding the newspaper reading and learning issues for district cadres, in addition to using the above methods, we have also decided to improve the study day system for district cadres, and check and help resolve the difficulties district cadres encounter in newspaper reading.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    大兴县开始建立读报制度
    编辑同志：人民日报读者杨林对我县忽视干部时事教育的批评是很正确的。我们经过检讨，认为造成这种现象的原因，主要是因为领导干部政治觉悟不高，不认识党报的重要性，把中心工作和读报工作对立起来的缘故。
    为了彻底纠正以上偏向，我们决定建立读报学习的制度。目前，我们拟从以下几个方面着手改进：
    （一）在每一个时期，根据不同情况制订时事学习提纲，指明学习重点，组织讨论。（二）建立不定期的时事测验制度。（三）把机关读报组进行一次整顿，加强对读报组的领导。
    此外，关于区干部的读报学习问题，我们除运用以上办法外，并决定把区干部的学习日健全起来，检查和帮助解决区干部读报中的困难问题。
