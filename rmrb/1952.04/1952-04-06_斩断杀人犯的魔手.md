    Sever the Murderer's Devilish Hands
    By Tikov, Soviet High-Speed Cutting Lathe Operator, Stalin Prize Winner
    The people of the world are extremely shocked by the new heinous crimes of the savages across the ocean. They violate the most basic principles of human morality and openly wage germ warfare, spreading flies, fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes carrying plague, cholera, and other germs. The frenzied imperialists attempt to use these sinister means to destroy the will of the indomitable people.

    The bloody war in Korea has been going on for twenty months. For twenty months, the imperialists have been bombing, ravaging, and burning this small country. The plunderers across the ocean have brought death and disaster, rubble and ruins to the freedom-loving Korean people.

    At the outbreak of the Korean War, honest people in all countries of the world condemned the aggressors. A powerful protest movement unfolded worldwide. The Chinese People's Volunteers went to assist their Korean brothers.

    We, the Soviet people, watch the courageous struggle of the Korean people with ardent sympathy. We admire the heroism of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They are repelling the reckless aggressors, defending the noble cause of peace with weapons in their hands.

    People of all nationalities need peace as much as they need air. I have met some foreign workers' delegations. I have also been abroad, to the German Democratic Republic and Finland. Everywhere I saw that the most ardent desire of the broad masses of people is for peace. I am convinced that ordinary people do not want another bloody war. When the Korean armistice negotiations began due to the Soviet Union's proposal, a hope arose in their hearts.

    But the American imperialists do not want a peaceful resolution to the Korean conflict. They have repeatedly attempted to sabotage the negotiations with various provocations. But they failed! So they changed their tactics. The American representatives attempted to delay the negotiations with absurd and unreasonable demands, causing the negotiations to fail. And all this is being done under the mask of "peace-loving," while those American politicians who seem concerned about maintaining peace are uttering hypocritical remarks.

    The warmongers are disguised as peacemakers. The executioners who kill women, the elderly, and children try to prove that they are virtuous gentlemen; rapists portray themselves as representatives of modern civilization. What a despicable and ugly scene!

    I am an ordinary Soviet worker, just like hundreds and thousands of other laborers in our peaceful Soviet country. I live in Moscow. I work in a factory. I study, go to the theater, and read books. I feel boundless joy for every new victory in our peaceful labor, because every victory brings us closer to the communist era we long for.

    Not long ago, I went to the Urals. The Soviet Political Science Knowledge Popularization Association commissioned me to give lectures to workers in the Urals on high-speed metal cutting methods. This trip was very satisfying. I can proudly say that the experience of Moscow's high-speed cutting workers has helped many workers in the Urals increase their labor productivity and produce more peaceful products for the motherland.

    In the Urals, I met some outstanding individuals – creators. Everywhere I saw the skeletons of new buildings. Everywhere there was a peaceful and prosperous life. As I sat on the train crossing the vast fields of the motherland, beautiful pictures unfolded outside the window before my eyes. The Soviet people are confidently building a communist society, which is also fighting for peace. I feel very happy to be able to contribute my small amount of strength to this struggle. However, when I hear about what is happening in Korea, I cannot remain indifferent.

    Pyongyang is far from Moscow. The sound of American bombs exploding, the whistling of bullets, and the groans of tortured Korean patriots do not reach us here. We cannot see the raging fire burning over the Korean land, but in the heart of every Soviet person, these sounds are ringing, these flames are burning.

    We all know the preciousness of peace. We have suffered the aggression of the Hitlerite savages. The war took away the loved ones of many of us. Today, the Americans in Korea are continuing to do what that frenzied "Führer" did in the past. They are fanning the flames of war, trying to spread it to the whole world. In order to realize their wild ambitions, the warmongers are determined to commit the most barbaric crimes.

    The people of all countries will never allow this to happen. A new wave of anger at the shocking atrocities of the American madmen has been aroused all over the world. The Soviet people demand an end to the unnecessary bloodshed. Peace must be restored to Korea. The murderer's devilish hands must be severed!

    斩断杀人犯的魔手
    苏联高速切削镟工  斯大林奖金获奖人  季科夫
    全世界人民听到了大洋彼岸生番们新的滔天罪行，都感到极度的震惊。他们违反了人类道德最起码的原则，公然进行细菌战争，撒布带有鼠疫、霍乱和其他病菌的苍蝇、跳蚤、扁虱和蚊子。狂暴的帝国主义者企图用这种罪恶的手段来摧毁不屈的人民的意志。
    朝鲜的流血战争已经进行了二十个月。帝国主义者轰炸、蹂躏和焚烧这个小小的国家，也有二十个月了。大洋彼岸的掠夺者给爱好自由的朝鲜人民带来了死亡和灾难，瓦砾和废墟。
    在朝鲜战争爆发时，全世界各国正直的人们都痛斥侵略者。全世界展开了强大的抗议运动。中国人民志愿军前往援助他们的朝鲜兄弟。
    我们苏联人民以热烈的同情心，注视着朝鲜人民奋不顾身的斗争。我们赞美朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英雄气概。他们反击着胡作非为的侵略者，手执武器捍卫着崇高的和平事业。
    各族人民需要和平，正如需要空气一样。我曾遇到过一些外国的工人代表团。我也到过外国，到过德意志民主共和国和芬兰。我到处都看到，广大人民群众最热烈的愿望，就是需要和平。我确信，普通的人民都不愿意再有一次新的流血。当朝鲜停战谈判由于苏联的建议而开始的时候，他们的心里都油然产生了一个希望。
    可是美国帝国主义者并不想和平解决朝鲜的冲突。他们屡次企图以各种挑衅行为来破坏谈判。但是他们办不到！于是他们改变了策略。美国代表们企图以荒谬绝伦的无理要求来拖延谈判，使谈判陷于失败。而这一切，是在“爱好和平”的假面具下进行的，同时，那些仿佛关心维护和平的美国政客们又大发其伪善的言论。
    战争贩子们装扮成和事佬的姿态。杀害妇女、老人和儿童的刽子手们企图证明他们是善人君子；强奸犯把自己描写为现代文明的代表。这是多么卑鄙、多么丑恶的景象！
    我是一个普通的苏联工人，正和我们和平的苏维埃国家里千百个其他的劳动者一样。我住在莫斯科。我在工厂里工作。我学习，上戏院，看书籍。我对我们在和平劳动中每一个新的胜利都感到无限快慰，因为每一个胜利都使我们所盼望的共产主义时代早日来临。
    不久以前我到过乌拉尔。苏联政治科学知识普及协会委托我对乌拉尔的工人作关于高速切削金属方法的讲演。这一次旅行使我十分满意。我可以自豪地说，莫斯科高速切削工人的经验，帮助乌拉尔许多工人提高了劳动生产率，为祖国生产了更多的和平产品。
    我在乌拉尔认识了一些杰出的人物——创造者。我到处都见到新建筑物的骨架。到处都是和平的、富裕的生活。当我坐火车越过祖国广阔的原野时，在我眼前的窗外展开了一幅一幅美丽的图画。苏维埃人们在满怀信心地建设着共产主义社会，也就是在为和平而斗争。我感到很幸福，能够在这个斗争中贡献我小小的一点力量。可是，当我听到在朝鲜发生的事情时，我却不能无动于中。
    平壤离莫斯科很远。美国炸弹的爆炸声、枪弹的飞啸声和被折磨的朝鲜爱国志士的呻吟声，传不到我们这里。我们看不见朝鲜土地上空燃起的熊熊火光，可是，在每一个苏维埃人的心里，这些声音在响着，这些火焰在燃烧着。
    我们都知道和平的可贵。我们遭受过希特勒生番的侵略。战争夺去了我们中间许多人的亲人。今天美国人在朝鲜又继续干着那个狂暴的“元首”过去所干过的勾当。他们煽起战争的火焰，企图使它蔓延到全世界。为了实现他们的狂妄野心，战争贩子们决心不惜犯下最野蛮的罪行。
    各国人民决不容许这样。全世界都激起了抗议美国疯子的新的惊人暴行的怒潮。苏联人民要求停止无谓的流血。朝鲜必须恢复和平。必须斩断杀人犯的魔手！
