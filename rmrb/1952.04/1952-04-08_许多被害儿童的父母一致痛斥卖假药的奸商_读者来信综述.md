    Many Parents of Harmed Children Unanimously Condemn Profiteering Merchants Selling Fake Medicine – A Summary of Readers' Letters

    After our newspaper published the article "Let All Mothers Under Heaven Accuse!" we received eleven letters from readers in the two days of March 29th and 30th. A total of thirty readers signed these letters. The letter writers are mostly fathers and mothers whose children have been poisoned by the bad medicine of profiteering merchants. They unanimously demand that the People's Government punish these unscrupulous and lawless merchants who are harming the lives of the next generation of New China.

    In reader Ding Chuan's letter, he said painfully: This group of profiteering merchants is simply inhuman. They are actually using such vicious methods to harm infants who cannot speak. Their crimes are no different from the crimes of American imperialism in killing Korean children.

    A collective letter from the fathers and mothers of twenty children denounces these profiteering merchants as beasts in human skin. They said: "We work hard to raise children, hoping that they will be able to serve the motherland when they grow up, but the profiteering merchants only care about making more money and inhumanly harm the lives of a large number of children."

    Mothers are very saddened when narrating how their children became increasingly thin after taking medicines such as "Zhegu Cai" and eventually died from it. At that time, they did not understand that this was the work of profiteering merchants secretly plotting against their children. The great "Five-Anti" movement exposed the hypocritical masks that the profiteering merchants had been hiding for more than ten years. Therefore, they feel that only the People's Government is selfless, realistic, and serves the people.

    Readers suggest that the People's Government immediately strictly prohibit the sale of these drugs in various places, and strictly inspect all kinds of prepared medicines sold on the market.

    许多被害儿童的父母一致痛斥卖假药的奸商
    ——读者来信综述
    本报发表了“让普天下的母亲们都来控诉吧！”一文后，在三月二十九、三十日两天内，就收到了十一封读者来信。在这些信上签名的读者共有三十人。写信人大部分是被奸商的坏药毒害过的孩子的父亲和母亲。他们一致要求人民政府惩办这些丧尽天良、谋害新中国下一代生命的违法商人。
    读者丁川的来信中，沉痛地说：这群奸商简直毫无人性，他们竟用这种毒辣手段来暗害不会说话的婴儿；他们的罪行和美帝国主义杀害朝鲜儿童的罪恶是并无两样的。
    有二十个儿童的父亲和母亲集体来信控诉，称这些奸商为披着人皮的野兽。他们说：“我们辛辛苦苦地抚育儿童，希望他们长大后能为祖国服务，而奸商们却只为多赚钱，便毫无人性地大批伤害儿童的性命。”
    母亲们在叙述自己的孩子吃了“鹧鸪菜”等药物后，日渐消瘦下去，以至于不治而亡时，是非常沉痛的。当时她们不了解这是奸商在暗算她们的孩子。伟大的“五反”运动揭穿了奸商们隐藏已达十余年之久的伪善面具，因此，她们感到只有人民政府才是大公无私、实是求是，为人民服务的。
    读者建议人民政府立即严禁这些药品在各地销售，对市上经售的各种成药，一律应加严格检查。
