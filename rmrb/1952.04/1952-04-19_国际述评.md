International Commentary

Strengthening International Peace and Friendship

The Moscow International Economic Conference successfully concluded on April 12th. Simultaneously, the International Conference for the Defense of Children opened in Vienna, the capital of Austria. Both conferences are major events in international political and economic life, demonstrating the new efforts made by people of all countries to strengthen international peace and friendship.

The International Economic Conference has achieved great successes. During the conference, representatives of various countries freely exchanged opinions, conducted extensive trade negotiations, and concluded many trade contracts. As the conference communique pointed out, the representatives "unanimously agreed that the volume of world trade can be greatly increased, and that expanding trade relations between countries can bring many benefits to businesses, industries, and agricultural operators, can make fuller use of the economic resources of all countries, can increase employment, and improve people's living standards."

During the conference and after its closing, the many trade agreements signed between Eastern and Western countries are of great significance for strengthening international economic cooperation and improving the living conditions of people in capitalist countries. Our country has signed import and export agreements with business people from Britain, France, Switzerland, and other countries, totaling more than 160 million US dollars. The Soviet Union's orders for the increasingly depressed British textile industry will reach millions of pounds. French companies have agreed to exchange goods worth 3 billion francs (approximately 85.5 million US dollars) with Romania. These concrete facts have made the representatives of capitalist countries, who originally had many doubts about the conference, realize that it is entirely possible to restore and develop economic relations between countries, even with different economic and social systems.

The International Economic Conference is a good start for developing international economic cooperation. In extensive contacts, representatives of various countries have discovered the potential strength of each country in trade. The conference's achievements have strengthened the confidence of people of all countries in international economic cooperation. Representatives of various countries unanimously hope to continue and expand their efforts in international trade. The conference adopted a letter to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the UN General Assembly to convene a government representative conference as soon as possible, with the participation of business people, trade unions, and other social organizations from various countries, to promote the expansion of trade between countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and appropriate consideration of the special needs of industrialization in backward countries. The conference also believes that it is appropriate to hold another international economic conference based on the principles followed in this International Economic Conference. To realize these recommendations, the conference elected a committee to promote international trade. The conference called for the elimination of artificial barriers and efforts to develop international trade.

The great achievements of the International Economic Conference have bankrupted the lies of the US and British governments that attempted to smear the conference. It has not only proved that the abnormal state of international economic relations is entirely changeable, but also proved that the development of international trade is entirely in line with the wishes of the people of all countries.

The International Conference for the Defense of Children, with more than 500 representatives from 61 countries, is discussing the issue of protecting children's lives, health, and education by maintaining peace.

In their speeches, representatives of various countries pointed out that as a result of the imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation, the living conditions of children in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies have deteriorated. War and famine seriously threaten the people and children of these countries. Only a quarter of all children in the United States receive minimal education, and four million school-age children have no access to education at all. Two-thirds of Greece's national budget is used for war preparations, while very little is spent on education; currently, there are 15,000 innocent children in children's prisons in Greece. Due to a lack of medical care, the mortality rate of children in Sudan is as high as 50 percent. The US aggression against Korea has caused the deaths of large numbers of Korean children. Japanese children are forced to give blood transfusions to American soldiers injured in the war of aggression against Korea.

In contrast, in the speeches of representatives from our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries, it was unanimously pointed out that the policy of peace has brought a happy life to children. Our country has established more than 10,000 delivery stations nationwide, and the number of nurseries during the busy farming season last year increased by 106 times compared to the previous year; currently, the number of children enrolled in schools in our country has exceeded the highest level of 1946 during the Kuomintang rule by 56 percent. Contrary to the continuous decline in the population reproduction rate in capitalist countries, the Soviet Union now increases its population by three million every year, and the birth of a baby is a great joy for every mother and family in the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic, according to the five-year plan, has allocated 280 million marks for the construction of schools alone.

The different lives of children in the two worlds show two futures: one is death and destruction, and the other is peace and happiness. The representatives of various countries attending the International Conference for the Defense of Children are striving to win a common peaceful and happy future for children all over the world. At a time when American aggressors are waging germ warfare against Korea and our country, seriously threatening the lives of millions of children, the convening of this conference is of greater significance, and it will play a major role in strengthening international peace and friendship and protecting children from the threat of war and famine.

The International Economic Conference and the International Conference for the Defense of Children not only demonstrate the possibility of peaceful coexistence between different social systems, but also express the sincere hope of peace-loving people of all countries for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation, as can be seen from the widespread welcome of the International Economic Conference and the concern of people of all countries for the living conditions of children. Undoubtedly, the holding and achievements of these two important international conferences will further strengthen the forces of defending peace in the world and fight to the end for international peace and friendship.

Striving for Democracy and Peace in Japan and Germany

At a time when people of all countries are strengthening their efforts to strive for international peace and friendship, US imperialism continues to disregard the peaceful aspirations of the people of Japan and Germany, and is intensifying its conspiracy to rearm Japan and Germany. This sinful behavior of the United States has aroused increasingly strong opposition from the people of Japan, Germany, and other countries around the world.

Under the direction of US imperialism, the reactionary Japanese government is formulating a series of reactionary bills to intensify the suppression of democratic forces in Japan, first and foremost targeting the Japanese Communist Party. The US-Japanese reactionaries are attempting to pave the way for the rearmament of Japan through this tyrannical suppression. However, the tyrannical suppression of the US-Japanese reactionaries will not only fail to stop the Japanese people's struggle against rearmament, but will instead make the Japanese people's struggle even stronger. As Mr. Ikuo Oyama, a famous Japanese cultural figure and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, said: "The struggle against rearmament has gradually become one of the most serious issues for all classes and social strata."

Japanese workers held a nationwide strike and protest movement on April 12th to oppose the fascist "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." Major trade unions across the country participated in this strike movement. These striking unions have a total of more than 400,000 members. According to Reuters, it is expected that two million workers will participate in the protest movement. This Japanese strike movement fully demonstrates that the Japanese working class has become more united and that its political awareness has rapidly increased.

Japanese workers have overcome the threats and divisions of the reactionary Yoshida government in this strike movement, and the reactionary faces of the upper echelons of some trade unions have been exposed. These upper echelons of trade unions, who showed wavering in the strike movement, have been resolutely opposed by Japanese workers. The "Committee for the Struggle Against the Revision of Inferior Labor Regulations," the leading organization of the anti-fascist bill in Japan, has issued a statement announcing that it will hold another strike on April 18th. This shows the Japanese working class's unyielding determination to resolutely crush the fascist bill of the Japanese Yoshida government.

While formulating the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill," the reactionary Yoshida government also passed another fascist "Special Criminal Law" on March 28th, which aims to suppress democratic forces in Japan and ensure the implementation of the aggressive US-Japan "Administrative Agreement." The JCP Congressional delegation has issued a statement expressing its firm opposition to this bill. Recently, American occupiers have instructed the reactionary Yoshida government to fabricate a series of conspiracy events, persecute communists and progressives who demand democracy, close down democratic newspapers, and conduct searches across the country. The American military court in Tokyo brazenly sentenced seven JCP activists, including Shichizo Iida, to long terms of hard labor and heavy fines. The US-Japanese reactionaries are intensifying the creation of reactionary bills to legalize their persecution of the Japanese people and further strengthen their fascist rule over the Japanese people.

The mass movement of the Japanese people against the fascist bill is expanding. This movement is an important part of the struggle against rearmament. The united struggle of the Japanese people and the Japanese workers will enable this mass movement to achieve further expansion.

At the same time, in order to realize Germany's peace, unity, and democracy as soon as possible, and to defeat the US conspiracy to split Germany and rearm West Germany, the Soviet government recently made another new effort on the German issue. In its reply to the US government on April 9, the Soviet government reiterated its proposal for holding all-German elections, establishing an all-German government, and concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. The Soviet government's reply once again demonstrated the Soviet Union's deep concern for establishing and consolidating peace in Europe.

From the recent exchanges of notes between the Soviet government and the US government, people all over the world can see more clearly that on the one hand, the Soviet government, in order to meet the demands of the German people and the aspirations of the European people, advocates concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, and believes that the German issue can be peacefully resolved on the basis of the common sincere wishes of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France. On the other hand, the US policy attempts to delay and obstruct Germany's unification. In its note to the Soviet government on March 25, the US government avoided expressing any opinion on the draft principles of the peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government, but raised extraneous issues on the conditions for conducting all-German elections and territorial issues, in order to persist in its reactionary policy of rearming Germany and incorporating it into the West European aggressive bloc. This sinful policy of the US government is also clearly manifested in the illegal actions it is currently taking in West Germany. The US government is attempting to sign a so-called "general treaty" with the Bonn puppet in order to prolong its occupation of West Germany and intensify its efforts to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic group.

In its reply on April 9, the Soviet government once again suggested that the US, British, and French governments jointly begin to study the peace treaty with Germany and the issues of unifying Germany and establishing an all-German government. The Soviet government's reply will surely give the German people and the European people more confidence and strength in their struggle against US imperialism. The Soviet government's efforts to strive for German unification and the peace aspirations of millions of European people will cause the US imperialist conspiracy to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and intensify the rearmament of West Germany to suffer a shameful defeat.

The Soviet government's efforts on the German issue and the staunch struggle of the Japanese working class are both powerful actions to safeguard world peace, and are therefore welcomed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. We believe that the struggle carried out by the peace-loving people of the world and the people of Japan and Germany together will defeat the war plans of US imperialism and achieve final victory.

专栏：国际述评

    国际述评
    加强国际和平与友好
    莫斯科国际经济会议于四月十二日胜利闭幕。与此同时，国际保卫儿童大会在奥地利首都维也纳开幕。这两个会议，都是国际政治和经济生活中的重大事件，它们表现了各国人民为加强国际和平与友好所作的新的努力。
    国际经济会议已获得了巨大的成就。在会议期间，各国代表自由无拘束地交换了意见，广泛地进行了贸易谈判，订立了许多交易合同。正如会议公报所指出的，各国代表“一致认为：世界贸易量可以大大增加，而各国之间扩大贸易关系，可以使企业界，工商界和农业经营者得到很多利益，可以使一切国家的经济资源得到更充分的利用，可以增加就业，提高人民的生活水准。”
    在会议期间和会议闭幕以后，东方和西方各国间签订的许多贸易协定，对于加强国际经济合作，改善资本主义国家人民生活状况，具有重大意义。我国与英、法、瑞士等国家的商业家已签订了进出口总额达一亿六千万美元以上的协定。苏联对于日趋萧条的英国纺织工业的订货将达数百万英镑。法国各公司已同意与罗马尼亚交换价值三十亿法郎（约合八千五百五十万美元）的货物。这些具体的事实，已使原来对会议还有许多怀疑的资本主义国家的代表认识到，经济制度与社会制度虽然不同，但恢复与发展各国间经济关系是完全可能的。
    国际经济会议是发展国际经济合作的一个良好的开端。各国代表在广泛的接触中，已发现了各国在贸易方面的潜在力量。会议的成就加强了各国人民对通过国际经济合作的共同信心。各国代表一致希望继续并扩大他们在国际贸易方面已经开始的努力。会议通过了致联合国大会书，要求联合国大会尽早召开一次有各国企业界人士、工会及其他社会团体参加的政府代表会议，以促进在平等互利与适当照顾落后国家工业化的特殊需要的基础上扩大各国间的贸易。会议并认为根据这次国际经济会议所遵循的原则，再举行一次国际经济会议是适当的。为了实现这些建议，会议选出了一个委员会来促进国际贸易。会议号召消除人为的壁障，努力发展国际贸易。
    国际经济会议的巨大成就，已使美英政府妄图污蔑这次会议的谎言破产了。它不仅证明了国际经济关系不正常的状况是完全可以改变的，而且证明发展国际贸易是完全符合各国人民的愿望的。
    有六十一个国家的五百余名代表参加的国际保卫儿童大会，正在讨论通过维护和平来保卫儿童的生命、健康和教育的问题。
    各国代表在发言中指出，由于帝国主义进行扩军备战政策的结果，已使资本主义国家，殖民地和附属国的儿童生活状况日趋恶化。战争和饥饿严重地威胁着这些国家的人民和儿童。美国全部儿童中只有四分之一受到极少的教育，有四百万学龄儿童根本没有受教育的机会。希腊的国家预算的三分之二用于战争准备，而用在教育方面的却微不足道；目前在希腊的儿童监狱里关着一万五千名无辜的儿童。由于缺乏医药照顾，苏丹儿童的死亡率高达百分之五十。美国对朝鲜进行的侵略，已使朝鲜儿童大批死亡。日本儿童则被迫去给在侵略朝鲜战争中受伤的美国士兵输血。
    与此相反，在我国、苏联和各人民民主国家代表的发言中，一致指出和平政策给儿童们带来了幸福的生活。我国全国已设立了一万多处接生站，去年农忙托儿所的数目比前年增加了一百零六倍；目前我国入学儿童的数目，已超过国民党统治时期最高水平的一九四六年的百分之五十六。与资本主义国家人口繁殖率不断降低的情形恰恰相反，苏联现在每年都增加三百万人口，婴儿的诞生对于苏联的每个母亲和家庭都是极大的快乐。德意志民主共和国按照五年计划规定，单是建筑学校就拨款二亿八千万马克。
    两个世界不同的儿童生活显示出两个前途：一个是死亡与毁灭，一个是和平与幸福。出席国际保卫儿童大会的各国代表们正为争取全世界儿童们有一个共同的和平与幸福的前途而努力。在美国侵略者正对朝鲜和我国进行细菌战，使千百万儿童的生命受到严重威胁的时候，这次大会的召开具有更重大的意义，它将在加强国际和平与友好、保护儿童使之免受战争和饥饿的威胁的斗争中起重大的作用。
    国际经济会议和国际保卫儿童大会不但显示了国际间不同的社会制度和平共处的可能性，而且也表现了各国爱好和平人民对国际间和平共处和友好合作的真诚希望，这只要看一看国际经济会议所受到的普遍欢迎和各国人民对儿童生活状况的关怀就可以知道了。无疑的，这两个重要的国际会议的举行及其成就，将使世界保卫和平的力量进一步加强起来，并为争取国际间的和平友好而斗争到底。
    争取日本和德国的民主与和平
    在各国人民为争取国际间和平友好而加强努力的时候，美帝国主义却继续不顾日本和德国人民的和平愿望，加紧进行重新武装日本和德国的阴谋。美国的这种罪恶行为，已引起日本、德国以及世界各国人民越来越强烈的反对。
    日本反动政府在美帝国主义的指使下，正制订一系列的反动法案，变本加厉地镇压日本的民主力量，首先是打击日本共产党。美日反动派妄图以这种蛮横的镇压，来为重新武装日本铺平道路。然而，美日反动派的蛮横镇压不仅不能阻止日本人民反对重新武装的斗争，反而使日本人民的斗争更为坚强。正如日本著名文化界人士、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人大山郁夫所说的：“反对重新武装的斗争已逐渐成为各个阶级和各个社会阶层的最严重的问题之一。”
    日本工人为了反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”，已于四月十二日举行了全国规模的罢工和抗议运动。全国各大工会都参加了这一罢工运动。这些罢工工会共拥有四十万人以上。据路透社透露：参加抗议运动的工人，预料将有二百万人。这次日本的罢工运动充分显示了日本工人阶级已团结得更为坚强，政治觉悟已迅速提高。
    日本工人在这次罢工运动中已战胜了吉田反动政府的恫吓和分化，并使若干工会的上层分子的反动面貌被揭露出来，这些在罢工运动中表示动摇的工会上层分子，已遭到日本工人的坚决反对。日本反法西斯法案的工会领导机构——“反对改劣劳动法规斗争委员会”已发表声明，宣布订于四月十八日再度举行罢工。这显示了日本工人阶级坚决粉碎日本吉田政府法西斯法案的不屈不挠的决心。
    在制订“防止破坏活动法案”同时，吉田反动政府又于三月二十八日通过了另一个法西斯的“刑事特别法案”，这个法案的目的就是为了镇压日本民主力量，保证侵略性的美日“行政协定”得以实行。日共国会议员团对此已发表声明，表示坚决反对。最近一个时期，美国占领者指使吉田反动政府制造一连串的阴谋事件，迫害共产党员和要求民主的进步人士，封闭民主报纸，并在全国进行搜查。东京美国军事法庭竟悍然对饭田七三等七名日共积极分子判处长期的苦役和大量罚款。美日反动派加紧制造反动法案，正是要使它们对日本人民的迫害合法化，更加强它们对日本人民的法西斯统治。
    日本人民反对法西斯法案的群众运动正在扩展。这一运动是反对重新武装斗争的一个重要部分。日本人民和日本工人的团结斗争，将使这一群众运动获得更进一步的扩展。
    与此同时，苏联政府为了早日实现德国的和平、统一和民主，并击败美国分裂德国和重新武装西德的阴谋，最近在德国问题上又作了一次新的努力。在四月九日致美国政府的复文里，苏联政府重申迅速举行全德选举、成立全德政府、以缔结对德和约的建议。苏联政府的复文，再度表明了苏联对建立与巩固欧洲和平的深切关心。
    从最近苏联政府和美国政府之间往返的照会中，全世界人民都可以更加清楚地看到这样的事实：一方面，苏联政府为满足德国人民的要求与欧洲人民的愿望，主张早日缔结对德和约，并认为德国问题在苏、英、美、法四国具有共同的真诚愿望的基础上，是可以获得和平解决的。另一方面，美国的政策则力图拖延和阻挠德国的统一。美国政府在三月二十五日致苏联政府的照会中，对于苏联政府所提出的关于缔结对德和约的原则草案，避不表示任何意见，却在调查进行全德选举条件，与疆土等问题上横生枝节，以坚持其重新武装德国并使之加入西欧侵略集团的反动政策。美国政府的这种罪恶政策，同时也明显地表现在目前它在西德所采取的非法行动上。美国政府正企图与波恩傀儡签订所谓“一般性条约”，以便延长它对西德的占领，来加紧把西德拉入北大西洋集团。
    苏联政府在四月九日的复文中再次建议美、英、法三国政府共同着手研究对德和约以及统一德国和成立全德政府的问题。苏联政府的这个复文，必将使德国人民与欧洲人民在与美帝国主义进行斗争中，获得更多的信心与力量。苏联政府这种为争取德国统一而作的努力，和千百万欧洲人民的和平愿望，将使美帝国主义拖延缔结对德和约与加紧重新武装西德的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。
    苏联政府在德国问题上所作的努力和日本工人阶级的坚强斗争，都是保卫世界和平的有力行动，因而都获得全世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和支持。我们相信，世界爱好和平人民和日本、德国人民在一起所进行的斗争，必能打败美帝国主义的战争计划，而取得最后的胜利。
