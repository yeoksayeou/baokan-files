	Newspapers Guide Our Quyi Creation

	To the Editor: The Beijing Quyi Work Group has been established for several months. We have created and performed many new programs, many of which are related to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In the process of creating and performing these new programs, we deeply realized that newspapers—especially the People's Daily—are important weapons to guide our creation.

	The work group was established during the vigorous "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements across the country. We wanted to perform some programs to cooperate with the movements, publicize policies, and expose the ugly faces of unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements, but we suffered from a lack of works. We wanted to create new works, but we suffered from a lack of materials as a basis. At this time, the People's Daily published Comrade Bo Yibo's report "Striving for Deep and Universal Development of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement," and also published many cases of bribery, theft, and corruption. After reading these articles, combined with our own past life experiences, the ugly images of many unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements emerged in our minds. We were determined to create our own works. On January 4th, we read the repentance letter of the corrupt element Xu Huiliang published on page three of the People's Daily: "I Chose the Path of Repentance and Self-Renewal," and based on this article, we created the image of a corrupt element who confessed after ideological struggle under the policy education and mass pressure. In this way, a group singing Paizi melody—"A Way Out"—which publicized the "Three-Anti" policy and pointed out the way out for corrupt elements, was collectively created by Hou Baolin, Sun Yukui, and Tan Boru.

	"A Way Out" was trial-performed on stage and on the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. The Beijing Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Quyi Improvement Association published this piece in "New Quyi." The Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Nanjing People's Broadcasting Stations have all recorded and broadcast it in various places.

	The success of the creation of "A Way Out" improved our understanding of newspapers. We paid more attention to reading newspapers. Before creating, we must carefully read the editorials and articles published in the newspaper that explain a certain policy, and draw materials from news, communications, and articles to correct the theme of creation and collect the content of creation.

	In the past few months, our group has created a total of seventeen new works. For example, the cross-talk "The Ugly Faces of Unscrupulous Merchants," which exposes the crimes of unscrupulous merchants, was written by processing the crimes of Zhang Mazi, an unscrupulous merchant in Beijing. The creation of the cross-talk "Bacteriology" and "Five-Anti Drum Songs," "Three-Anti Quick Rhymes," etc., were all based on opinions and materials from newspapers. Of these seventeen new works, nine have been performed more than thirty times. Because most actors usually pay attention to current affairs and political study, they can correctly express the theme and image of the characters during the performance. Therefore, the effect of our performances has been very good, and we have received a lot of encouragement from the audience.

	When literary and artistic groups in Guangxi and other places wrote to us asking us to introduce our creative experience, we replied: The most important thing is that authors and actors should always pay attention to reading newspapers and care about current affairs and politics. Only in this way can we determine the theme and combine it with our own life experiences to create vivid characters.

	Based on this experience, we will continue to strengthen reading newspapers and learning in the future to consolidate and develop our existing achievements.

	The Mentougou Cultural Center Helps Me Study Current Affairs
	I Created Many New Drum Lyrics

	To the Editor: Now I will talk to you about how the Cultural Center helped me create new drum lyrics.

	I am a Xihe drum lyrics performer who has only read for three months and can barely understand popular newspapers through self-study. When I came to Mentougou to perform this time, the "Three-Anti" movement was underway here. In order to strengthen the publicity about the "Three-Anti" movement, the comrades of the Mentougou Cultural Center repeatedly encouraged me to create some new drum lyrics to cooperate with the movement. They explained the policies to me and often introduced the materials published in the newspapers to me. I collected the collected materials, repeatedly studied them, and wrote the first draft based on my performance experience, and then discussed and revised it with the comrades of the Cultural Center. In this way, I successively created new drum lyrics such as "Never Share the Same Sky with Unscrupulous Merchants," "Young League Member Dong Yuan Exposes Wang Kangnian," "Liu Shiming Confessed," and "Defeat Bacteriological Warfare." In February and March, I sang more than 30 performances to the working people of Mentougou, and the performance effect was very good.

	I often think like this: As an artist with very low cultural and political level like me, it would be difficult to engage in new creation and reform of old Quyi without the help and education of newspapers and cultural institutions. Therefore, I hope that the literary and art institutions in Beijing will pay attention to leading the comrades in the Quyi circle to study current affairs.

	Beijing Tianqiao Artists Urgently Request to Conduct
	Current Affairs Study

	To the Editor: The artists in the Quyi and acrobatics circles of Tianqiao in Beijing urgently request to strengthen current affairs and political study in order to improve their ideological and political level and accelerate the reform of old Quyi. More than 80% of the artists in Tianqiao are illiterate; some people who know characters also have a very low cultural level. They are very concerned about the important domestic and foreign political issues published in the newspapers, but their reading ability is very low, their business activities are scattered, and the relevant departments have not organized them to help them solve these difficulties. Therefore, their demands for progress have not been met for a long time. At present, most of the artists in Tianqiao do not understand national affairs, and they cannot well undertake the task of propaganda in many political movements. For example, Luo Peilin, who pulls foreign films, is still singing old things that praise feudal emperors. The segments sung by other artists also lack new content. I hope that the Literary and Art Department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and relevant leading organs will pay attention to strengthening the current affairs and political education of the artists in Tianqiao, because only by improving the political and ideological level of the old artists can the reform of old Quyi be well promoted.
		Zhang Yingjie

	Editor's Note: The situation reflected by reader Zhang Yingjie should attract the attention of relevant leading organs. Quyi and acrobatics are art forms that are readily accepted by the broad masses. They have a fairly broad mass base. If we strengthen the current affairs and political education of artists and form them into a team that publicizes policies, educates the people, and promotes various tasks, it will play a great role. The Quyi and acrobatics circles in Tianqiao, Beijing have not been fully organized so far, and some people are still singing and praising the old things of feudal emperors, which is a very serious situation. It is hoped that the relevant organs will check and improve this situation.

专栏：读者来信

    报纸指导我们进行曲艺创作
    编辑同志：北京曲艺工作团已经成立几个月了。我们已经创作和演出了不少新的节目，很多节目的内容是有关“三反”和“五反”的。在这些新节目的创作和演出的过程中，我们深深地体会到：报纸——特别是人民日报，是指导我们进行创作的重要武器。
    工作团是在全国人民开展轰轰烈烈的“三反”和“五反”运动的时候建立的。我们想演出一些配合运动、宣传政策、揭发奸商和贪污分子的丑恶面目的节目，但是苦于没有作品。我们想创作新作品，又苦于没有材料作根据。这时，人民日报发表了薄一波同志“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告，又发表了许多行贿、盗窃和贪污案件。读了这些文章，结合上自己过去的生活体验，许多奸商和贪污分子的丑恶形象，就在我们的脑子中浮现出来了。我们下定了决心，自己创作。一月四日，我们又读了人民日报三版所载贪污分子徐惠梁的悔过书：“我选择了悔过自新的道路”，就根据这篇文章，创造了一个在政策教育和群众压力下经过思想斗争而坦白了的贪污分子的形象。这样，一出宣传“三反”政策并给贪污分子指出出路的群唱牌子曲——“活路”，就由侯宝林、孙玉奎、谭伯如集体创作出来了。
    “活路”在舞台上和北京市人民广播电台试演，受到各界人民的热烈欢迎。北京市大众文艺创作研究会和曲艺改进协会筹委会在“新曲艺”上刊载了这个曲子。北京、上海、沈阳、西安、重庆和南京市人民广播电台，都曾分别录音，在各地播送。
    “活路”创作的成功，提高了我们对报纸的认识。我们更加注意阅读报纸了。在创作之先，我们一定精读报纸上登载的说明某项政策的社论和文章，并从消息、通讯和文章中汲取素材，借以端正创作的主题思想和收集创作的内容。
    几个月来，我们全团共创作了十七篇新作品。比如揭露奸商罪行的相声“奸商的丑恶嘴脸”，就是以北京奸商张麻子的罪行为素材，而加工写成的。相声“细菌学”以及“五反鼓词”、“三反快板”等的创作，都是根据报纸上的意见和材料创作的。这十七篇新作品中，有九篇已经演出了三十多场。由于大多数演员平时注意时事和政治学习，所以在演出时，都能正确地表现主题思想和人物的形象。因此，我们历次演出的效果都很好，得到观众不少的鼓励。
    当广西等地的文艺团体写信要我们介绍创作经验的时候，我们答复：最重要的一条，就是作者和演员都要随时注意阅读报纸，关心时事和政治。这样才能确定主题，并和自己的生活体验结合起来，创造生动的人物的形象。
    根据这项经验，我们今后将继续加强读报学习，以巩固和发展既有的成绩。
            北京市曲艺工作团　孙玉奎门头沟文化馆帮助我学时事
    我创造了许多新鼓词
    编辑同志：我现在向你们谈谈文化馆帮助我创作新鼓词的情形。
    我是一个只读过三个月书、靠着自学勉强能看懂通俗报纸的西河大鼓词的演员。我这次到门头沟来演出时，这里正进行“三反”运动。门头沟文化馆的同志们为了加强关于“三反”的宣传，便一再鼓励我，要我创作一些配合运动的新鼓词来演唱。他们向我讲解政策，并且经常把报纸上发表的材料介绍给我。我把搜集到的材料集中起来，经过反复研究，根据自己演唱的经验，写出初稿，再和文化馆的同志们一起商量修改。就这样，我先后创作了“与奸商不共戴天”、“青年团员董渊检举王康年”、“刘世铭坦白了”以及“打垮细菌战”等新鼓词。二、三月间，我向门头沟的劳动人民演唱过三十多场，演出的效果都很好。
    我常常这样想：像我这样一个文化、政治水平很低的艺人，假若不能获得报纸和文化机关的帮助与教育，就很难从事新的创作和旧曲艺的改革工作。因此，我希望北京市的文艺机关注意领导曲艺界的同志们进行时事学习。　西河大鼓演员　蔡连贵
    北京天桥艺人迫切要求进行
    时事学习
    编辑同志：北京天桥曲艺杂技界的艺人们，迫切地要求加强时事、政治学习，以便提高思想政治水平，加速旧曲艺的改革工作。天桥百分之八十以上的艺人是不认识字的；有些认识字的人，文化水平也很低。他们很关心报纸上登载的国内外的重要政治问题，但是，他们的阅读能力很低，他们的业务活动是分散的，有关部门又没有把他们组织起来，帮助他们解决这些困难，所以，他们的进步要求，长期不能得到满足。目前天桥的大部分艺人对于国家大事是不了解的，他们在许多政治运动中，还不能很好地担负起宣传的任务。如拉洋片的罗沛霖，至今还在唱些歌颂封建帝王的旧东西，其他艺人所唱的段子，也都是缺乏新的内容的。我希望北京市文教局文艺处及有关领导机关，注意加强对天桥艺人的时事政治教育，因为只有提高旧艺人的政治思想水平，才能很好地推动旧曲艺的改革工作。
                          张英杰
    编者按：读者张英杰所反映的情况，应该引起有关领导机关的注意。曲艺和杂技是广大群众所乐于接受的艺术形式，它有相当广泛的群众基础。如果对艺人加强时事政治教育，把他们组成一支宣传政策、教育人民、推进各项工作的队伍，就会发挥很大的作用。北京天桥曲艺和杂技界至今还没有充分组织起来，有些人还在歌唱颂扬封建帝王的旧东西，这是十分严重的情况。希望有关机关加以检查，并改善这种情况。
