    To the Editor: The members of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical Prevention Service Seventh Detachment, serving on the Korean battlefield, have displayed a high degree of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism in the past six months, working hard to serve the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. No matter how difficult the environment, they have been tenaciously persisting in their work. In hospitals where supplies are extremely scarce, they have pooled the wisdom of all medical personnel to make mobile operating tables, hanging benches, washstands, medicine delivery boxes, instrument tables, and examination beds. They have saved many wounded and sick soldiers with these less-than-exquisite handmade items. In winter, they personally went up the mountains to chop firewood, allowing the wounded and sick to spend the entire cold winter warmly. At temperatures of minus fifteen degrees Celsius, the female comrades in the detachment still washed dressings in the river. Their spirit of hard struggle greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the soldiers.

    They have also made many contributions to the solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people. Not only do they work with Korean medical personnel in the hospital like brothers and sisters, helping Korean nurses improve their technical skills, but they also help the Korean people with spring plowing and fertilizer transportation in their spare time from medical work. They also practiced their vow to transfuse blood for the wounded and sick of the Chinese and Korean people. In six months, they transfused a total of 3,064 cc of blood. Comrade Gao Jingxia, a nurse in the detachment, transfused 450 cc of blood at one time. They used all the remuneration from blood transfusions to buy nutritious items such as eggs for the wounded and sick. They practiced Chairman Mao's instruction to "heal the wounded and rescue the dying, and promote revolutionary humanitarianism." Their self-sacrificing performance also embodies the spirit of the new Chinese Red Cross.

    Now, the comrades of this detachment are fighting against the bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism. They say: Under the banner of Mao Zedong, we are forever strong, and we have the strength to completely defeat the American bandits' aggression. The Chinese Red Cross Communications Group

    中国红十字会国际医防第七大队在朝鲜战地克服困难努力服务
    编辑同志：在朝鲜战地服务的中国红十字会国际医防服务第七大队的队员们，半年以来发挥了高度的国际主义和革命人道主义精神，努力为中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民服务。无论环境多么困难，他们都一直在顽强地坚持着工作。在物资非常缺乏的医院中，他们集中了全体医务人员的智慧，做了活动手术台、吊凳、洗手架、送药提盒、器械台、诊病床等。他们用了这些不太精致的手制品，救活了许多的伤病员。他们冬天亲自上山砍柴，使伤病员温暖地度过整个寒冬。在零下十五度的温度下，该队的女同志还在河里洗敷料。他们这种艰苦斗争的精神，大大地鼓舞了战士们的斗志。
    在中朝人民的团结上，他们也作了很多的贡献。他们不但在医院中和朝鲜医务人员如兄弟姊妹一样地一道工作，帮助朝鲜护士提高技术水平，并且在医务工作的空闲，也帮助了朝鲜人民春耕、运肥。他们也实践了为中朝人民的伤病员输血的誓言，六个月中他们共输了三千零六十四西西的血，该队护士郜静霞同志一次输血达四百五十西西。他们把输血所得的报酬，全部都用来买了鸡蛋等营养品送给伤病员。他们实践了毛主席的“救死扶伤，发扬革命的人道主义精神”的指示。他们自我牺牲的表现，也体现了新中国红十字会的精神。
    现在这一大队的同志们正在和美帝国主义所发动的细菌战进行战斗，他们说：在毛泽东的旗帜下，我们是永远坚强的，我们是有力量彻底击溃美国强盗的侵略的。    中国红十字会通讯组
