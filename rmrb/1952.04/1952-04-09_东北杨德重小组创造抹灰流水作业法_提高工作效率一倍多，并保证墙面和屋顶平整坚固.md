The Northeast People's Government Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company Harbin Engineering Office Yang Dezhong Plastering Team created an assembly line method for plastering, increasing work efficiency and improving project quality. Previously, a skilled worker could only plaster eight square meters of surface in nine hours. Now, in six hours, they can plaster twelve square meters, while guaranteeing the smoothness and solidity of walls and ceilings.

The Yang Dezhong team's previous plastering methods, like those of other plastering teams, were decentralized and unplanned. Each skilled worker was responsible for a section of plastering work, handling all the plastering steps for that section; apprentices only mixed and delivered the plaster. The new method divides the plastering process into four parts: applying hemp-reinforced plaster (for ceilings), applying sand plaster (for walls), creating plaster lines (decorative linear strips at the junction of ceilings and walls), and applying white plaster (the finishing layer on ceilings and walls). Each part is staffed with workers according to the required skills, and apprentices are assigned to each part alongside skilled workers, taking on simpler technical tasks. For example, the hemp-reinforced plaster and sand plaster application do not require highly skilled workers, so each is assigned a less skilled worker and an apprentice. In contrast, the white plaster application and the creation of plaster lines are more complex and require higher skills, so they are assigned highly skilled workers. The plastering work proceeds in the order of the plastering steps, with the workers responsible for each step operating sequentially. For example, when plastering dozens of rooms, at the start, all four groups of workers concentrate on the first room to apply the hemp-reinforced plaster and sand plaster. Then, the workers applying the hemp-reinforced plaster and sand plaster move to the second room to apply the hemp-reinforced plaster and sand plaster there, while the workers creating plaster lines and applying white plaster stay behind to focus on plaster lines and white plaster in the first room. By the time the work on plaster lines and white plaster in the first room is completed, the hemp-reinforced plaster and sand plaster in the second room are also finished. At this point, the first two groups of workers move on to the third room, and the latter two groups of workers follow into the second room. This process continues, step by step, transforming the previously disorganized and unplanned plastering work into a scientific assembly line operation.

After implementing the assembly line method, due to the fixed division of labor, each skilled worker does not need to engage in a variety of technical operations, but can focus on studying their specialty, so their skills improve rapidly. The most significant improvement is that they have improved many tools. For example, in the past, it took a long time to apply sand plaster straight on wall corners, but now they have developed a wooden triangular tool that can be run up and down the corners to make them straight and save time; in the past, window sills were plastered using "strips," and a skilled worker could plaster a maximum of five window sills a day, but now they have developed a mold board, allowing a skilled worker to plaster twelve window sills a day. Secondly, due to the rational change in labor organization, apprentices also took on some technical operations and received more help and guidance from skilled workers. Therefore, within just three months of implementing the assembly line method, two of the six apprentices in the team became third-grade technicians, and the remaining four apprentices also became fourth-grade technicians.

    东北杨德重小组创造抹灰流水作业法
    提高工作效率一倍多，并保证墙面和屋顶平整坚固
    东北人民政府工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处杨德重抹灰小组，创造抹灰的流水作业法，提高了工作效率和工程质量。过去一个技工工作九小时，只能抹八平方公尺灰，现在工作六小时，就能抹十二平方公尺灰，还保证了墙面和屋顶的平整和坚固。
    杨德重小组过去的抹灰工作方法，和其他抹灰小组一样，是分散的、无计划的。每个技工各自把持着一段抹灰工程，这段工程的几道抹灰工序都由他一个人干；而徒工只做配灰和送灰工作。新的操作法把抹灰工序分成了抹麻刀灰（即抹屋顶灰）、抹砂子灰（即抹墙壁灰）、勒灰线（即用灰作屋顶和墙角连接处的线形条纹）和抹白灰（即抹屋顶和墙壁的表面灰）等四部分。各部分都按照需要的技术配备工人，徒工也跟技工一样的被分配到各部分去，担任一些较简易的技术工作。例如：抹麻刀灰和抹砂子灰的工作都不需要技术很好的技工来抹，就各自配备一名技术较差的技工和一名徒工。又如抹白灰和勒灰线的工作比较复杂，需要有较高的技术才能抹好，就配备技术较高的技工来担任。抹灰工作的进行是按抹灰工序的先后，由各工序的专责工人先后来操作。例如：要在几十间屋子里进行抹灰工作时，工作一开始，四部分的工人都集中在第一间屋子里把麻刀灰和砂子灰抹好，然后抹麻刀灰和抹砂子灰的两部分工人就转到第二间屋子里去再抹麻刀灰和砂子灰，而勒灰线和抹白灰的两部分工人留下专勒灰线和抹白灰，等到第一间屋子里的勒灰线和抹白灰的工作完成时，第二间屋子的麻刀灰和砂子灰也就抹好了。这时，前两部分工人又转入第三间屋子去工作，而后两部分工人也就随着进到第二间屋子来工作了。这样继续下去，步步推进，就把过去无组织、无计划的抹灰工作，变成了科学的流水作业。
    实行流水作业法之后，由于有了固定的分工，每个技工不必从事多种多样技术的操作，可以专心研究各人的专业，所以技术迅速提高。最显著的是他们已经改进了许多工具。如过去在墙角上抹砂子灰，需要很长时间才能抹直，现在他们研究出一种木制的三棱形工具，顺着墙角上下来回一抹，墙角又正又直，还节省时间；过去抹窗台用“板条”操作，一个技工一天最多能抹五个窗台，现在他们研究出用模型板，一个技工一天就能抹十二个窗台。其次，由于合理地改变了劳动组织，徒工也担任了一部分技术操作，受到了技工更多地帮助和指导。因此，组内六个徒工仅仅在实行流水作业法以后的三个月中，就有两个徒工成了三等技工，其余四个工徒也成了四等技工。（新华社）
