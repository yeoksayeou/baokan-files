(Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 22nd) According to TASS, Vienna, April 21st: Austrian working people are protesting the persecution of Professor Brandweiner, who was ordered by the Ministry of Education to be dismissed from his professorship at the University of Graz for participating in the investigation of American atrocities in Korea and China.

    The Austrian Peace Council stated in a special statement that it considers the dismissal of Brandweiner to be an attempt to intimidate all those who fight for truth and humanity. The statement said: "The Austrian people sincerely thank Professor Brandweiner for assisting in exposing the heinous bacteriological warfare. Therefore, the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner means supporting bacteriological warfare, which is an act against peace."

    The leading body of the Free Austrian Youth League, representing tens of thousands of Austrian youth, also protested the dismissal of Brandweiner from the University of Graz.

    Many factories in Vienna and other cities have also held protest meetings. Workers from factories such as "Oesel-Hiranz" and "Ostro-Fiat" have written letters to the Minister of Education expressing their protest. The workers unanimously stated that the persecution of Professor Brandweiner is reminiscent of the methods used by the Hitler bandits to persecute democrats.

    Professor Brandweiner has received many letters and telegrams from all over Austria, in which workers and progressive intellectuals express their solidarity and pledge their support. They are grateful for his heroic struggle for peace and thank him for exposing the crimes of the American military in Korea.

    奥进步组织和各地劳动人民抗议迫害布兰德魏纳
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十一日讯：奥地利劳动人民抗议迫害布兰德魏纳教授，他因参加调查美国在朝鲜和中国的暴行而被教育部下令解除格拉茨大学教授职务。
    奥地利和平理事会在发表的特别声明中指出：它认为把布兰德魏纳免职是企图恫吓一切为真理和人道进行斗争的人们。声明说：“奥地利人民热诚感谢布兰德魏纳教授，因为他协助揭发了罪恶的细菌战。因此，免除布兰德魏纳教授的职务，意味着对细菌战表示拥护，这是反对和平的行动。”
    自由奥地利青年联盟的领导机构，代表成千成万的奥地利青年，也对解除布兰德魏纳在格拉茨大学的职务一事表示抗议。
    维也纳和其他城市的许多工厂也纷纷举行抗议集会。“奥塞尔·希兰茨”、“奥斯特洛——费亚特”等工厂的工人，写信给教育部长表示抗议。工人们一致声明，对布兰德魏纳教授的迫害，使人想起希特勒匪徒使用的迫害民主人士的方法。
    布兰德魏纳教授接到来自奥地利各地的许多信件和电报，工人和进步知识分子在这些电报和信件中向他表示声援，并保证予以支持。他们感激他为争取和平而进行的英勇斗争，并感谢他揭露了美军在朝鲜的罪恶活动。
