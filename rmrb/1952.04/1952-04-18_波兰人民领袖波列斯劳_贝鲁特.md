\tSixty years ago, Poland was divided by the then imperialist powers Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and suffered the cruel oppression of foreign rulers. The emerging Polish bourgeoisie ruthlessly exploited the working people. The still powerful landlord class wantonly plundered the peasants. The Polish people, under the leadership of the young proletariat, began to organize themselves to fight against this triple oppression.

\tIn 1892, Engels wrote a preface to the Polish edition of "The Communist Manifesto." He pointed out that Poland's "independence can only be won by the young Polish proletariat, and once the Polish proletariat has won it, then it will be completely secure."

\tOn April 18, 1892, Bolesław Bierut, the future President of People's Poland and Chairman of the Polish United Workers' Party, was born. His father was a small farmer who went bankrupt after a major flood. When Bierut was one year old, the family moved to the city, and the father changed from a starving farmer to a barely subsisting worker. His parents tried everything to send him to school. However, he soon dropped out.

\tThe year 1905 arrived. The storm of the first Russian revolution inspired the struggle of the Polish people. Young students rose up to demand the use of the Polish language and the establishment of Polish schools, because at that time the Polish language was forbidden in schools. The thirteen-year-old Bierut was the most enthusiastic fighter in this struggle. He was one of the organizers of the strike movement in his hometown of Lublin. Thus, the doors of the school were permanently closed to him.

\tA hard life of labor began. Construction worker, newsboy, bookstore servant, printing apprentice, and later printing worker. These jobs were beyond the capacity of a young man, and during periods of unemployment, he suffered from hunger and cold.

\tThe doors of the school were closed to him, but the doors of knowledge were opened to him. He did not have the opportunity to go to school, but he still learned a lot. The more he learned, the more his thoughts developed, and the more he used it to organize and teach his comrades. Bierut's first major political activity was organizing youth groups. He became the leader and inspirer of several progressive youth groups in Lublin. He was the founder of a secret youth newspaper. He actively propagated socialist ideas and opposed all oppressors and their right-wing agents in the workers' movement. In 1914, he actively participated in the movement against the imperialist war. During the Great War, he continued to carry out revolutionary work in Lublin. Later, due to a search by the constabulary, he hid in a village. He worked with the peasants and studied the living conditions of the peasant class. He realized the position of the peasants in the future revolution and the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, recognizing that the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class was the guarantee of the victory of the working people. This was something that many Polish revolutionaries at the time did not adequately recognize.

\tThe October Revolution marked a new era in world and Polish history. Thanks to the victory of the Bolsheviks, Poland was liberated from foreign enslavement. The Polish working people demanded the establishment of their own regime. Comrade Bierut, a member of the Communist Party of Poland, was one of the active organizers of this movement. The Communist Party of Poland was formed in 1918 by the merger of two old Polish Marxist parties—the "Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania" and the left wing of the Polish Socialist Party.

\tThe bourgeoisie still established its cruel rule in Poland. Bierut began a difficult revolutionary life. He participated in the open cooperative movement, using it as a base for carrying out revolutionary activities. The Party often entrusted him with important work. He traveled between Warsaw and the Polish coal mining area. He was arrested six times. He was one of the members of the Party's Secretariat, and he was one of the most determined fighters against the revisionists of bourgeois social democracy.

\tHowever, the fascist police searched him repeatedly. He faced a long prison sentence, so the Party decided that he should leave Poland immediately. He used his exile to complete his studies in Moscow. In 1931, he returned to Poland, ready to continue serving the people and the Party of his motherland. He restarted his indomitable struggle against the fascist regime and its right-wing Socialist Party lackeys.

\tIn those years, it was impossible to do revolutionary work without being persecuted by the fascist police. In 1933, Comrade Bierut was sentenced to a long prison term. He was imprisoned with the best Polish communists in the most terrible fascist prison in the city of Rowicz.

\tAfter Poland was occupied in 1939, Bierut worked with Polish patriots in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1943, he returned to occupied Poland and soon became the most outstanding activist of the secret Marxist Polish Workers' Party. He was the organizer and chairman of the underground parliament under fascist oppression—the Polish "National Council." The "National Council" was founded on December 31, 1943, and included representatives of all democratic parties and groups. After liberation, it became Poland's first parliament—the first representative body of the Polish people's regime.

\tSince liberation, Comrade Bierut has led the Polish people along the glorious road to a bright future. He was the Chairman of the National Council and later the President of the Republic. Thanks to Comrade Bierut's leadership and serious struggle, the Polish workers' movement was able to purge right-wing elements—those most insidious agents of imperialism—from its ranks. Due to his efforts, the Polish workers' movement achieved unity—in December 1948, the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party merged into the Polish United Workers' Party, and he was unanimously elected chairman.

\tComrade Bierut, a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, is one of the main designers of Poland's Three-Year Reconstruction Plan (1947-1949) and the Polish Six-Year Plan for building the foundations of socialism. Now, under his leadership, the first democratic constitution of Poland is being drafted.

\tComrade Bierut leads the Polish people forward along the bright path of patriotism and proletarian internationalism. He teaches the Polish people that the friendship, assistance, and experience of the Soviet Union are the guarantee of the final victory of the Polish people in building socialism. He enthusiastically promotes the friendship between the Polish people and the great China, other people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people. He was the first Pole to sign the Stockholm Appeal and the declaration for the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact. His visits to the German Democratic Republic and the President of Czechoslovakia are important actions to strengthen peace in Europe.

\tComrade Bierut is the great teacher of all the working people of Poland. Workers and artists, working peasants and teachers, construction workers and administrative workers in New Warsaw, all have the opportunity to contact him and receive detailed teachings and instructions from him. He is very concerned about any issues in the construction of the new Poland.

\tOn the occasion of Comrade Bierut's sixtieth birthday, the Polish people and peace-loving people all over the world warmly celebrate his great achievements in his work for the Polish people and the world's peace and democratic camp. (Attached picture)

    波兰人民领袖波列斯劳·贝鲁特
    本报特稿
    六十年以前，波兰被当时的帝国主义列强俄、普、奥三国所瓜分，遭受着外国统治者的残酷压迫。新兴的波兰资产阶级无情地剥削着劳动人民。势力仍旧强大的地主阶级蛮横地掠夺着农民。波兰人民，在年轻的无产阶级领导下，开始把自己组织起来，为反对这三重压迫而斗争。
    一八九二年，恩格斯为“共产党宣言”的波兰文版写过一篇序言。他指出，波兰的“独立只有年轻的波兰无产阶级才能争得，而一当波兰无产阶级把它争到手的时候，那它就会完全有保障了”。
    一八九二年四月十八日，未来的人民波兰总统和波兰统一工人党主席波列斯劳·贝鲁特诞生了。他的父亲是一个小农，在一次大水灾后破了产，当贝鲁特一岁的时候家庭搬到城里去，父亲从一个饥饿的农民变为一个仅能糊口的工人。他的父母想尽了办法才把他送进学校去。然而不久就又失学了。
    一九○五年来了。俄国第一次革命的风暴鼓舞了波兰人民的斗争。青年学生们起来要求使用波兰文和建立波兰学校，因为当时波兰文在学校中是被禁用的。年甫十三的贝鲁特是这一斗争的最热烈的战士。他是他所住的卢布林城罢课运动的组织者之一。于是学校的大门对他永久关闭了。
    艰苦的劳动生活开始了。建筑工人，报童，书店仆人，印刷学徒，后来是印刷工人。这些工作都不是年轻人所能胜任的，而且在失业期间，他又遭受了饥饿和寒冷。
    学校的大门对他关闭了，但是知识的大门却对他洞开着。他没有机会上学，可是他仍然学到许多知识。他学到的东西越多，思想越发展，他就越以此来组织和教导他的同志们。贝鲁特第一次重大的政治活动是组织青年团体。他成为卢布林城好几个进步青年团体的领导者和鼓舞者。他是一个秘密的青年报纸的创办者。他积极地宣传社会主义思想，而反对一切压迫者及其在工人运动中的右派代理人。一九一四年，他积极参加反对帝国主义战争的运动。在大战期间，他继续在卢布林进行革命工作。后来因为宪兵的搜查，他藏到一个村庄里。他和农民在一起劳动，研究农民阶级的生活状况。他认识到农民在未来的革命中所处的地位和工农联盟的重要性，认识到在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟是劳动人民胜利的保证。这一点，是当时许多波兰革命者认识不足的。
    十月革命标志着世界历史和波兰历史的新纪元。感谢布尔什维克的胜利，波兰得以从外国奴役下解放出来。波兰劳动人民要求建立自己的政权。波兰共产党党员贝鲁特同志就是这个运动的积极组织者之一。波兰共产党是在一九一八年由两个老的波兰马克思主义政党——“波兰与立陶宛社会民主党”和波兰社会党左派合并而成的。
    资产阶级仍然在波兰建立了它的残酷统治。贝鲁特开始艰苦的革命生活。他参加公开的合作社运动，把它作为进行革命活动的地盘。党经常委托给他重要的工作。他奔走于华沙和波兰煤矿区之间。他被捕六次。他是党的书记局委员之一，他是反对资产阶级社会民主的修正主义者的最坚决的战士之一。
    但是，法西斯警察一再搜查他。他面临长期的徒刑，于是党决定他立刻离开波兰。他利用他的流亡期间在莫斯科完成了他的学业。一九三一年他回到波兰，准备继续为祖国人民和党服务。他重新开始他的不屈不挠的斗争，反对法西斯制度及其右翼社会党走狗。
    在那些年月里，做革命工作而不遭法西斯警察迫害是不可能的。一九三三年，贝鲁特同志被判长期徒刑。他和波兰最优秀的共产主义者一同被监于罗维支城的最恐怖的法西斯牢狱中。
    在一九三九年波兰被占领以后，贝鲁特在白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国，与波兰爱国分子在一起工作。一九四三年，他回到被占领的波兰，不久就成立秘密的马克思主义的波兰工人党的最卓越的活动家。他是在法西斯压迫下的地下议会——波兰“国民议会”的组织者和主席。“国民议会”成立于一九四三年十二月三十一日，包括一切民主政党和团体的代表。解放以后它成为波兰的第一个议会——波兰人民政权的第一个代表机关。
    解放以来，贝鲁特同志领导波兰人民沿着光荣的道路走向美好的未来。他是国民议会的主席，后来是共和国的总统。感谢贝鲁特同志的领导和严肃的斗争，波兰工人运动得以从自己的队伍中肃清右倾分子——那些最阴险的帝国主义代理人。由于他的努力，波兰工人运动获得统一——一九四八年十二月，波兰工人党和波兰社会党合并为波兰统一工人党，他被一致推举为主席。
    列宁、斯大林的忠实学生贝鲁特同志，是波兰三年复兴计划（一九四七——一九四九）和建设社会主义基础的波兰六年计划的主要设计者之一。现在，在他的领导下，第一个波兰民主宪法正在草拟中。
    贝鲁特同志领导波兰人民沿着爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的光明道路前进。他教导波兰人民：苏联的友谊、援助和经验是波兰人民在建设社会主义中取得最后胜利的保证。他热心地促进波兰人民和伟大的中国、其他人民民主国家及一切爱好和平的人民之间的友谊。他是在斯德哥尔摩宣言和缔结五大国公约宣言上签名的第一个波兰人。他的访问德意志民主共和国和捷克总统，是加强欧洲和平的重要行动。
    贝鲁特同志是波兰全体劳动人民的伟大导师。工人和艺术家，劳动农民和教员，新华沙的建筑工人和行政工作者，所有的人都有机会和他接触，并从他那里得到详尽的教导和指示。对于建设新波兰中的任何问题他都是非常关心的。
    在贝鲁特同志六十岁诞辰的今天，波兰人民和全世界爱好和平人民都热烈庆祝他在为波兰人民和世界和平民主阵营的工作中所获得的伟大成就。（附图片）
