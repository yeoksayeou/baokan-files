Letter to the Editor Summary

    Suggestions to film and create slideshows about the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by American imperialism

    Letters from readers of this newspaper suggest filming and creating slideshows about the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by American imperialism, and widely showing them throughout the country to educate the masses. The following are summaries of these letters:

    Chen Renzhi of the Wuwei County Health Center in Northern Anhui said: "I hope that the heinous crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and our northeastern, Qingdao and other regions can be filmed and shown in large and small cities and villages." Wang Yuqing of the Beijing Twelfth District People's Government said in his letter: "The monstrous crimes of American imperialism must be recorded so that people all over the world can further recognize the crimes of the American murderers." Zhu Feng of the Jinxi Provincial Middle School in Western Liaoning wrote: "Recently, I listened to the "Health Lecture" broadcast by the Liaoning People's Broadcasting Station, which explained how to prevent and eliminate bacteria; I think this kind of publicity is very good. Because the anti-bacterial warfare is the combat mission of the people of the whole country, everyone should take active action." He suggested making movies or slideshows on preventing and eliminating bacteria. The "Three-Anti" Propaganda and Education Group of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau and Rui Lirong and others of the Beijing Municipal Eleventh Middle School also have the same suggestions.

    Suggestion to film the performance of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe

    Dear Editor: The Hungarian National People's Art Troupe has come to our country to perform, which is a major event in our cultural life.

    I believe that everyone hopes to have the opportunity to see the performance of the art troupe from our brother country. This can not only enable us to learn the outstanding art of the Hungarian people, but also enable the Chinese people to better understand and love the Hungarian people. Such cultural exchanges will inevitably promote the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people to be closer and more consolidated.

    Although the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe has performed in our country, there are still very few people who have the opportunity to see it. In order to meet everyone's requirements, I suggest filming the performance of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe so that people all over the country can have the opportunity to appreciate and learn the art of the Hungarian people.

    The Nankou Railway Factory Cinema should correct the problem of not showing movies on time

    Dear Editor: Some cadres of the Nankou Railway Factory Cinema have a purely profit-seeking point of view. They often do not show movies at the prescribed time, which seriously affects the workers' rest time and creates a very bad impression. For example, when showing the film "Eternal Secret," the last show was delayed by one hour and did not end until after twelve o'clock in the middle of the night. When showing the film "Happy Life" on the fourth of this month, it was also delayed. The workers who bought tickets for the last show asked for a refund because they waited too late, but the ticket seller said, "You don't have to worry about what time it will be shown," and refused to refund the tickets. Later, the tickets were refunded after negotiation. Some workers said: "This cinema doesn't care whether the workers rest or produce, it only cares about making money." Someone has made suggestions to the cinema, but they still have not corrected this problem. I think the Nankou Railway Factory Cinema should clarify its policy of serving the workers, humbly consider the workers' opinions, and arrange suitable times to show movies so that the movies can not only achieve the purpose of educating the workers, but also not delay the workers' rest or hinder production.

    The propaganda effect of slideshows has increased due to the change in explanation method

    Dear Editor: During this winter vacation, we organized a propaganda team to conduct propaganda to the masses. There was a slideshow team in the propaganda team. We changed the slideshow narrator's dull explanation method, and the propaganda effect increased. When showing slideshows such as "Seven Little Heroes" and "Increase Vigilance", the narrator did not simply narrate the story of the slideshow, but acted as an actor in the play, speaking when necessary and laughing when appropriate. This kind of screening is very popular among farmers. When we show films in the countryside, the farmers enthusiastically find tables and poles for us...like treating relatives. The farmers said: "This is much better than the slideshows in the past. This is like a movie," "It's a small movie, with speaking and singing, and it's quite lively." In addition, we also tried to match the lighting. When showing tragic scenes, we used gray cellophane to cover the lens, and when showing happy scenes, we used light red cellophane, which further increased the propaganda effect.

    Suggestions to strengthen political education for storytellers

    Dear Editor: Recently, I heard someone telling stories at the Liuyuan Fair in Dongguan, Liaocheng. The storyteller was clear in his speech and vivid in his expressions, and three or four hundred people surrounded him to listen. However, the stories he told were all without educational significance and were of no benefit to the audience. I think there are many storytellers like this in various places, and I hope that the relevant departments will strengthen their political education so that they can tell and sing new content books and become good propagandists for educating the people.

    Should use temple fairs for literary and artistic propaganda

    Dear Editor: Spring is here, and temple fairs are being held in rural areas everywhere. This is a good place for mass literary and artistic propaganda. Some temple fairs perform new plays such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Wang Xiuluan," "The Transformation of the Loafer," "The White-Haired Girl," and "Liu Hulan," which are very popular with the audience. Some temple fairs are still performing some feudal and backward plays, which is very bad. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant literary and artistic departments perform more plays that are popular with farmers at temple fairs to conduct patriotic education for the farmers.

    When compiling scientific and technological books from capitalist countries, toxic parts should be deleted

    Dear Editor: Since the liberation of the whole country, production has been booming. In order to meet the needs of production development, the national writing, translation, and publishing circles have written, translated, and published a large number of technical books, which is a good phenomenon. However, many of these books have not been selected and revised, resulting in many errors and even spreading pro-American ideas. For example, the first chapter of "Principles of Power Transmission" translated by Zhang Zhongjun and Ruan Shanguang, published by Longmen Bookstore, almost entirely objectively boasts about the "industrialization" and "electrification" of the United States, saying that "each worker in the United States uses about five horsepower" of electricity, and so on. This is obviously doing free publicity for the American ruling class.

    It is absolutely necessary to critically absorb the technology of capitalist countries today. However, compilers must be selective in the compilation process and must not copy the deceptive propaganda of imperialism.

    Fertilizer problems should be solved for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers

    Dear Editor: The cadres of the Preferential Treatment Committee of Baishen Village, Changping County, Hebei Province, in order to do a good job in substitute farming, visited all the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the village during the spring plowing preparation work, and found that the main problem in the current production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers was the lack of fertilizer (29 households of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were short of fertilizer for a total of 42 mu of land). The village cadres called on everyone to accumulate fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers at various meetings, combining it with drought prevention and resistance work, and repeatedly explained to the masses that helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers do a good job in production is to strengthen the practical action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The peasants of the whole village responded to the call of the cadres and actively accumulated fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. As of April 9, a total of 562 loads of fertilizer, or 37 carts, had been accumulated, solving the fertilizer shortage problem for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. At the same time, the village cadres also convened a meeting of substitute farming team leaders to decide to sow seeds for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers on time. I think all localities should pay attention to the fertilizer problem of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, because this is the key to ensuring increased production on the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.

    来信摘要
    建议把美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行拍成电影和制成幻灯片
    本报读者来信，建议把美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行拍成电影和制成幻灯片，到全国各地广泛放映，以教育群众。现把这些来信摘要如下：
    皖北无为县卫生院陈任之说：“希望把美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北、青岛等地区撒布细菌的滔天罪行拍成影片，深入到大小城市、乡村放映。”北京十二区人民政府王玉清的来信中说：“必须把美帝国主义的滔天罪行记载下来，使全世界人民进一步认识美国杀人犯的罪行。”辽西省立锦西中学朱枫来信说：“最近收听辽西人民广播电台广播‘卫生讲座’，内容是讲解如何预防和扑灭细菌；我觉得这样的宣传很好。因为反细菌战是全国人民的战斗任务，每个人都应积极行动起来。”他建议拍制预防和扑灭细菌的电影或幻灯片。上海市人民政府卫生局“三反”宣传教育组和北京市立第十一中学芮丽容等也有同样的建议。
    建议把匈牙利国家人民文工团的表演摄成电影
    编辑同志：匈牙利国家人民文工团到我国来表演了，这是我国文化生活上的一件大事。
    我相信每个人都希望有机会看看我们兄弟国家文工团的演出。这不只可以使我们学习匈牙利人民的卓越艺术，而且可以使中国人民更加了解，更加热爱匈牙利人民。这样的文化交流必然促使中匈两国人民的友谊更加亲密，更加巩固。
    匈牙利国家人民文工团虽然已在我国演出，而有机会看到的人还很少。为了满足大家的要求，我建议把匈牙利国家人民文工团的表演摄成电影，使全国人民都能有机会欣赏、学习匈牙利人民的艺术。

    南口铁路工厂电影院应改正不按时放映影片的毛病
    编辑同志：南口铁路工厂电影院某些干部，有单纯营利观点，他们常常不按规定时间放映电影，严重地影响了工人们的休息时间，造成很坏的印象。如演“永远的秘密”影片时，末场迟映一点钟，深夜十二点以后才散。本月四日演“幸福的生活”影片时，也放映迟了。买了末场票的工人，因为等得太晚，要求退票，售票员竟说：“几点演你不用管”，拒绝退票。后来经过交涉才把票退了。有些工人说：“这个电影院不管工人休息不休息，生产不生产，只顾赚钱”。曾有人给院方提意见，他们仍不纠正这种毛病。我觉得南口铁路工厂电影院应该明确自己为工人服务的方针，虚心考虑工人的意见，安排合适的时间放映电影，使电影既能达到教育工人的目的，又不致耽误工人的休息，不致妨碍生产。天津铁路管理局南口机务段工人    赵金钟
    改变了讲解方式，幻灯的宣传效果增加了
    编辑同志：在今年寒假，我们组织了一个宣传队，向群众进行宣传。宣传队里面有个幻灯组。我们把幻灯讲解员呆板的讲解方式改变了一下，宣传效果增加了。在演“七个小英雄”、“提高警惕”等幻灯片时，讲解员不是单纯地叙述幻灯的故事，而是作为剧中的演员，该说的时候说，该笑的时候笑。这样放映，很受农民的欢迎。我们在农村放映时，农民们热情地给我们找桌子、裁杆子……像招待亲人一样。农民说：“这比从前的幻灯强多了。这跟电影一样”，“是小电影，有说有唱，还怪热闹的”。除此之外，我们还想法配光，放映悲惨的场面时，用灰色玻璃纸套在镜头上，放时愉快的场面时，用淡红色的玻璃纸套上，这就更增加了宣传的效果。

    建议加强对说书人的政治教育
    编辑同志：最近我在聊城东关柳园集会上，听到有人在会上说书。说书人口才清晰，表情生动，有三、四百人围着他听。但是他说的全是些没有教育意义的故事，对于听众没有什么好处。我想，像这类说书人在各地是非常多的，希望有关部门加强对他们的政治教育，使他们说唱一些新内容的书，成为教育人民的好宣传员。    锺守吉
    应该利用庙会作文艺宣传
    编辑同志：春天来了，各地农村中纷纷举办庙会，这是进行群众性文艺宣传的好场所，有些庙会演出“小二黑结婚”“王秀鸾”“二流子转变”
    “白毛女”“刘胡兰”等新戏，观众十分欢迎。有些庙会还在演唱一些封建落后的戏，这是很不好的，因此，我建议有关文艺部门多多在庙会演出农民欢迎的戏，向农民进行爱国主义教育。

    编译资本主义国家科学技术书籍时，应该删除有毒的部分
    编辑同志：全国解放以来，生产事业蓬勃发展，为了适应生产发展的需要，全国著译界和出版界著译和出版了大量技术性的书籍，这是一种好现象。可是，其中有不少书籍是没有加以选择和修正的，以致错误百出，甚至散播着崇美思想。例如，龙门书局出版的张钟俊、阮善光合译的“电力传输原理”第一章，几乎完全是客观主义地吹嘘美国的“工业化”、“电气化”，说什么“美国每一工人约用五马力”的电力，等等。这显然是替美国统治阶级作了义务宣传。
    批判地吸收资本主义国家的技术在今天是完全必要的。但是，编译者在编译过程中，必须有所选择，不要把帝国主义的欺骗宣传依样搬过来。

    应该为烈属军属解决肥料问题
    编辑同志：河北省昌平县百善村优抚委员会的干部，为了作好代耕工作，在春耕准备工作中，访问了村中全体烈属军属，发现了烈属军属当前生产中的问题，主要是缺少肥料（二十九户烈属军属，一共缺少四十二亩地的肥料）。该村村干部在各种会议上，结合防旱抗旱工作，号召大家为烈属军属积肥，向群众反复说明，帮助烈属军属搞好生产，就是加强抗美援朝的实际行动。全村农民响应干部号召，踊跃地给烈属军属积肥。到四月九日止，共积肥五百六十二挑，合三十七车，解决了烈属军属的缺肥问题。同时，该村干部又召开了代耕组长会，决定给烈属军属按时播种。我想各地都应该注意烈属军属的肥料问题，因为这是保证烈属军属的土地增产的关键。    杨燕东
