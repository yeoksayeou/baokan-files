Concerning Several Questions on Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation
Central Agricultural Department, Agricultural Policy Division, Land Utilization Section

The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952" points out to us: "Increasing the application of fertilizer is the most feasible and effective way to increase yield per unit area at present." It also requires us to attach importance to pig raising and manure accumulation, and specifically proposes: "At present, the most effective way to accumulate fertilizer is to raise pigs. Governments at all levels should formulate practical plans for increasing the number of pigs and lead farmers to quickly achieve 'every household raises pigs and builds pens to accumulate manure'."

Why is raising pigs the most effective way to accumulate fertilizer at present?

First, because pig manure is an organic fertilizer rich in plant nutrients. One hundred catties of pig manure contains about ten catties of organic matter, 0.5 catties of nitrogen, 0.35 catties of phosphorus, and 0.4 catties of potassium (varying depending on the quality of the feed). The grass used as bedding also contains many organic substances and plant nutrients. It not only provides crops with abundant nutrients, but also increases the organic matter in the soil, promotes the formation of aggregate structures, and improves soil fertility. The experience of the patriotic production increase movement over the past year has proved that the large-scale use of organic fertilizers is one of the main factors in increasing yield per unit area, and pig manure is precisely one of the good organic fertilizers. Last year, many labor models used pig manure and achieved high yields. For example, Chen Yongkang, a rice production model in Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu, achieved a high yield of 1,433 catties per mu because he applied 1,600 catties of pig manure per mu, coupled with other aspects of intensive farming. Therefore, he said: "Whether farming is done with care depends on whether you raise pigs or not." Han Luomu, a wheat production model in Anguo County, Hebei, also attached great importance to raising pigs and accumulating manure. He believes: "Pigs, soil, and grass are the three treasures."

Second, practicing thrift and economy is the fundamental method for developing production in our country. We must tap the potential forces in rural areas and use all available but not fully utilized manpower and material resources to increase production. Raising pigs precisely conforms to this principle. In rural China, there are still many agricultural by-products such as sweet potato vines and melon tendrils from the fields, bran, lees, and starch residue from workshops, and leftover food from kitchens that have not been fully utilized; these are all good feed for pigs. There are also many small amounts of floating capital in rural areas that are not fully utilized, not enough to buy large livestock, but just right for raising pigs. The feeding management and equipment for pigs are also relatively simple, and most farmers can do it. Therefore, farmers have great potential in raising pigs, and it is entirely possible to develop it on a large scale under the current rural economic conditions.

One pig (average weight 70 catties) excretes about 2,500 catties of manure per year. If we increase the number of pigs by 20 million in rural areas across the country this year, and use the best methods to accumulate manure, minimizing nutrient loss, the manure produced by the 20 million pigs, in terms of the plant nutrients it provides alone, is equivalent to 500,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, 460,000 tons of superphosphate, and 200,000 tons of potassium sulfate. This figure is equivalent to five times the total amount of chemical fertilizers used nationwide last year. In addition, the yield increase effect caused by the increase of organic matter promoting the soil aggregate structure is even more inestimable. This will provide a strong material guarantee for increasing the application of fertilizer and will be of great help to agricultural production this year. At the same time, raising pigs can also increase the supply of meat, and pig bristles and casings are important export goods, which are of great benefit to the prosperity of farmers and the national economy. Therefore, promoting pig raising and manure accumulation is a measure that is fully in line with the current requirements for developing production.

How can we achieve "every household raises pigs and builds pens to accumulate manure"?

To achieve "every household raises pigs and builds pens to accumulate manure," the following specific issues must be resolved:

1. Feed Issues: To raise pigs well, reduce pig diseases, and obtain pig manure with greater fertilizer effect, clean and nutritious feed is needed. Generally, people believe that "pigs are the most lowly livestock and do not need to be fed good things." This concept is wrong. Although it is difficult for farmers to use soybean cakes, corn, bran, lees, and other feeds, under the current economically permissible conditions, we should try our best to encourage the use of clean feeds. Rotten or spoiled leftover food with insects cannot be used to feed pigs; if it must be used, it should be boiled and cooled before use. In many areas of North China, human feces are often used to feed pigs. This habit should be changed, because it can spread tapeworm disease and is harmful to human health. After raising pigs on a large scale, a shortage of feed may occur. This requires trade departments in various regions to vigorously organize rice mills, flour mills, oil presses, etc. to do a good job in supplying feed. Recently, in Songjiang, Southern Jiangsu, and other places, due to the supply of feed falling short of demand, feed prices have risen, and pig prices have fallen, resulting in the slaughter of piglets. This lesson is worth vigilance in all regions.

2. Manure Accumulation Issues: The main purpose of raising pigs is to accumulate manure. The experience accumulated by Chinese farmers in the process of thousands of years of production is extremely rich. However, at present, many farmers still do not build pens for raising pigs, and manure is everywhere, not only failing to accumulate manure, but also endangering human and animal health. Many farmers have pig pens, but because the pig pens are not well built or the manure accumulation methods are improper, a large amount of fertilizer is lost from the manure. If farmers across the country use the best methods to accumulate pig manure, we can obtain fertilizer equivalent to more than three to four million tons of chemical fertilizer. If we do not pay attention to manure accumulation, these fertilizers will be lost invisibly, causing a waste in agricultural production. Therefore, agricultural institutions at all levels must earnestly guide farmers to improve manure accumulation methods. Various regions must formulate specific improvement methods based on local conditions and improve one step on the original basis. Those who raise pigs without pens must build pens. Those who have pens should seek improvements in preserving the fertilizer in the manure, repairing old pens. The bottom of the pen should be compacted with clay or secured with bricks and stones to prevent leakage of manure. Usually, the pen should be padded frequently to keep the livestock shed clean, reduce epidemics, and preserve fertilizer. Manure piles should be piled tightly and covered to prevent wind and sun exposure; and attention should be paid to turning and watering to maintain appropriate humidity and temperature (the statement that water accumulation in the pen can accumulate more manure is wrong, because excessive water not only makes the manure difficult to decompose, but also makes pigs prone to disease). There is a wealth of practical experience in manure accumulation in rural areas. Therefore, it is essential to earnestly summarize farmers' good manure accumulation experience and promote it.

3. Swine Fever Issues: Another obstacle to developing pig raising is swine fever. Today's medicine has made it possible to prevent swine fever; the problem is whether to pay attention to prevention and control. It is generally believed that pigs do not like cleanliness and are called "mud pigs," which reduces vigilance against epidemic prevention. This is the root cause of the occurrence of epidemics. We must implement the principle of "prevention is more important than treatment," and pay attention to the hygiene and maintenance of pigs on weekdays, match the feed according to the growth period and use of the pigs, adjust the cold and heat appropriately, use appropriate amounts, and feed on time. In addition, attention should also be paid to environmental hygiene. Pig pens should be sunny, ventilated, dry and warm, and cool and warm, and the pens should be padded frequently, the troughs should be rinsed frequently, and kept clean. Building pens can reduce the spread of epidemics. Newly purchased pigs should first be fed in separate pens for three weeks, and if there are no signs of illness, they should be fed with the large group to prevent the introduction of diseases. Once an epidemic occurs, the sick pigs should be isolated immediately, and the district and village government or the veterinary epidemic prevention agency should be reported, and the guidance of the government's veterinary staff should be followed to seal off the epidemic area and inject serum or vaccines as appropriate; the pig pens of the sick pigs should be thoroughly disinfected, and the dead pigs should be burned or deeply buried and not used for any purpose. To do a good job in prevention and control, it is also necessary to carry out in-depth publicity in an organized and led manner, organize farmers to form village livestock protection groups, study prevention and control methods together, formulate livestock protection covenants, and implement them together.

4. Transportation and Sales Issues: The biggest concern of farmers raising pigs is "fear that large pigs are worthless"; some farmers believe that "raising too many pigs may lead to price drops in the future" and dare not raise pigs. Therefore, the sales of pigs is also the most important issue in developing pig raising. At present, in some local areas such as Rugao and Jiangdu in Northern Jiangsu, due to sluggish sales of pigs, pig prices have fallen, and some sales of pigs are not enough to offset the cost of feed, and large pigs are even cheaper than small pigs, and the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs is low, and even sows are slaughtered and piglets are abandoned. This is the biggest obstacle to promoting pig raising and manure accumulation. Therefore, trade departments such as native product companies and livestock companies and cooperatives must find ways to open up the sales of pigs. In some places with inconvenient transportation, the transportation department should also be combined to effectively solve the problem of pig sales; or advocate making cured meat for transportation and sales to distant places. On the basis of active promotion, good education of the masses can break the ideological concerns about fear of price drops caused by raising too many pigs.

    关于养猪积肥的几个问题
    中央农业部农政司土地利用处
    中央人民政府政务院“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”，给我们指出：“增施肥料是当前提高单位面积产量可能而且最有效的办法。”并要我们重视着养猪积肥，特别提出：“在目前积肥最有效的办法就是养猪，各级政府应制定增殖猪的切实计划，领导农民迅速地做到‘家家养猪，修圈积肥’。”
    为什么在目前积肥最有效的办法是养猪？
    首先，因为猪厩肥是一种含有丰富植物养料的有机肥料。一百斤猪粪尿中约含有机物十斤，氮○·五斤，磷○·三五斤，钾○·四斤（随饲料质量不同而有差异），垫圈的草中也含有许多有机物和植物养料。它不但能供给作物丰富的养料，而且能增加土壤里的有机质，促进团粒结构的形成，提高土壤的肥沃性。一年来爱国丰产运动中的经验证明，大量使用有机肥料是增加单位面积产量的主要因素之一，而猪厩肥正是良好的有机肥料之一。去年有不少劳动模范使用了猪厩肥而获得丰产，如苏南松江县水稻丰产模范陈永康，就因每亩施用了一千六百斤猪厩肥，再加上其他方面的精耕细作，而得到一千四百三十三斤的高额产量。所以他说：“种田存心不存心，看侬（你）养猪不养猪。”河北安国县小麦丰产模范韩洛木也很重视养猪积肥。他认为：“猪、土、草是三桩宝。”
    第二，厉行节约是我国发展生产的根本方法；我们要发掘农村中的潜在力量，利用一切能利用而尚未完全利用的人力物力来增加生产。养猪正符合于这个原则。我国农村中还有许多农家屑物如田场里的薯藤瓜蔓，作坊里的糠麸、糟粕、粉渣等副产品，厨房里的残汤剩羹，没有充分利用；而这些却是喂猪的好饲料。农村中还有许多小额游资没有充分利用，买大牲畜不够，正好用来养猪。猪的饲养管理和设备也较简单，一般农民都能做到。因此，农民在养猪方面具有很大的潜在能力，在目前农村经济条件下大量发展是完全可能的。
    一口猪（平均体重七十斤）一年内排泄粪尿约二千五百斤。假如今年在全国农村中增殖二千万口猪，而且用最好的方法来积肥，使养分损失达到最低限度，则二千万口猪所产厩肥，仅就其所供给的植物养料来说，就等于五十万吨硫酸铵、四十六万吨过磷酸钙和二十万吨硫酸钾。这个数字相当于去年全国所用化学肥料总量的五倍。此外，由于增加有机质促进土壤团粒结构所产生的增产作用，更无法估计。这将给增施肥料提供有力的物质保证，对今年农业生产将有极大的帮助。同时，养猪又能增加肉食供应，而猪鬃、肠衣又是出口的重要物资，对于农民和国家经济的繁荣也有很大的好处。因此，提倡养猪积肥是完全适合目前发展生产的要求的措施。
    怎样才能做到“家家养猪，修圈积肥”？
    要做到“家家养猪，修圈积肥”，必须解决下面几个具体问题：
    一、饲料问题：要养好猪，减少猪的疾病，并且得到肥效较大的猪厩肥，就需要清洁而滋养的饲料。一般人认为“猪是最下贱的家畜，不必喂好东西”。这个观念是错误的。要农民都采用豆饼、玉米、糠麸、糟粕等饲料虽然有困难，但在目前经济许可的条件下，应尽量提倡多用清洁的饲料，腐败或变味生虫的残汤剩羹不能喂猪；如果一定要用，也应该煮沸冷却后再用。华北许多地区常以人粪喂猪，这个习惯应该改变。因为这样会传布绦虫病，对人的健康有妨害。在大量养猪以后，可能发生饲料不足的现象。这就需要各地贸易部门大力组织机米厂、粉坊、油坊等做好饲料供应工作。最近苏南松江等地由于饲料供不应求，饲料价格上涨，猪价下跌，发生宰杀小猪的现象，这个教训是值得各地警惕的。
    二、积肥问题：养猪的主要目的在于积肥。我国农民在几千年生产过程中所积累的积肥经验是异常丰富的。但目前还有不少农民养猪不打圈，粪溺遍地，不但攒不到粪，而且有碍人畜卫生。不少农民有猪圈；但因猪圈建筑不好或积肥不得法，使粪尿的肥分损失很大。全国农民假如都用最好的方法攒积猪厩肥，我们就可得到相当于三、四百万吨以上的化学肥料的肥料。假如我们不注意积肥，这些肥料就会在无形中损失掉，造成农业生产中的一种浪费。因此，各级农业机构必须切实指导农民改进积肥方法。各地必须根据当地条件，订出具体的改进办法，在原有基础上提高一步。养猪无圈的必须修圈。有圈的要在保存粪尿肥分上求改进，修补旧圈。圈底要用黏土打实或用砖石箝固，勿使粪液漏失。平常要勤垫圈，以保持畜舍清洁，减少瘟病，并保存肥分。粪堆要堆积紧密，并加覆盖，勿使风吹日晒；并注意翻倒和灌水，以保持适当的湿润和温度（圈里积水能多攒粪的说法是错误的。因为水分过多不但厩肥不易沤烂，猪也容易得病）。在各地农村中都有一些丰富而实际的积肥经验。因此，认真总结农民良好的积肥经验，加以推广是十分必要的。
    三、猪瘟问题：发展养猪的另一个阻碍，便是猪瘟。今天的医学已使防止猪瘟成为可能；问题在于注意不注意防治。一般认为猪不爱清洁，称之为“泥猪”而减少了防疫的警惕。这就是瘟疫发生的根源。我们必须贯彻“防重于治”的方针，平日应注意猪的卫生保养工作，根据猪的生长时期和用途来配合饲料，要冷热适调、用量适当，并按时给食。此外，尚须注意环境卫生。猪圈要向阳、通风、高燥而凉暖适宜，要勤垫圈，常涮槽，保持清洁。打圈可以减少瘟病的传染。新购猪只先要隔圈喂养三周，如无病象，再和大群合饲，以免疫病的传入。一旦发生瘟病时，要立刻隔离病猪，并报告区村政府或兽疫防治机关，听从政府兽医人员的指导，封锁疫区，酌情注射血清或疫苗；对病猪圈要彻底消毒，要烧毁或深埋死亡的病猪，不作任何利用。要做好防治工作，还须有组织有领导地深入宣传，组织农民成立村护畜小组，大家研究防治方法，订立护畜公约，共同执行。
    四、运销问题：农民养猪最大的顾虑是“怕大猪不值钱”；有的农民认为“养猪多了，将来可能跌价”，不敢养猪。因此，猪的销路也是发展养猪的最重要的一个问题。目前局部地区如苏北如皋、江都因猪只销路不畅，猪价下落，有的卖猪抵不上饲料钱，有的大猪反比小猪贱，群众养猪情绪低落，甚至宰杀母猪、抛弃小猪。这是提倡养猪积肥的最大的障碍。因此，土产公司、畜产公司等贸易部门和合作社必须想出办法，打开猪的销路。在某些交通不便的地方，更应结合运输部门切实解决猪的销路问题；或提倡制腌肉，以便运销远方。在积极推销的基础上，再很好地教育群众，就可以打破害怕养猪过多招致跌价的思想顾虑。
