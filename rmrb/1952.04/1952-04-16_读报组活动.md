Reading Group Activities

    Shaanxi Daily Guides Reading Groups to Solve the Problem of Integrating Reading with Production
    People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: After the Central People's Government's State Council issued instructions on the drought prevention and resistance movement, we immediately published a letter to reading groups in the newspaper, mobilizing them to organize mutual aid groups on the basis of reading groups to participate in this movement; and requested reading groups to use various forms to publicize the principles of drought prevention and resistance to the masses. Recently, we have received many letters from reading groups, all expressing their intention to actively participate in this movement and to strike at the crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria with practical actions to do a good job in drought prevention and resistance. They studied articles on drought prevention and resistance in the newspaper, conducted discussions, and formulated specific plans. Fourteen reading groups in Yanqiumen Village, Chang'an, held a forum for veteran farmers, using examples of disasters suffered by farmers in the past to overcome the paralyzing thoughts of some farmers who "rely on the heavens for food," and also introduced experiences and methods of drought prevention and resistance to each other. Currently, the masses in the whole village are actively participating in this movement. The women's reading group in Southeast Fang Village, Guotang Township, Xianyang Sixth District, mobilized 196 women in the whole village to form 18 women's mutual aid groups, hoed the wheat fields in the whole village twice, and rolled over 17 hectares and 86 acres of cotton fields once, freeing up male labor to repair two waterlogged ponds. The reading group in Dongyangshan Village, Weibin District, Chang'an County, showed "native films" in seven or eight villages, which greatly promoted drought prevention and resistance work in rural areas.
    The reading groups that write to us are generally mutual aid groups. The farmers who participate in the reading groups work together in production, read the newspaper together, and discuss it in light of actual conditions. For example, the Han Nongyuan reading group (which is also a mutual aid group) in Garden Village, Ziwu District, Chang'an, carries newspapers with them when hoeing wheat in the fields, and uses rest time to read the newspaper. Once, the group leader raised the question of "Why does hoeing the ground conserve moisture," and launched a discussion. When there were differences of opinion, the newspaper reader would take out the newspaper and read it aloud. After everyone understood the principle, they happily said, "We still have to hoe the second time!" These reading groups have indeed played a great role because they closely integrate reading the newspaper with production. However, for the province as a whole, most reading groups have not yet achieved this. Therefore, we recently sent another letter to the propaganda departments of various county committees, hoping that they would pay attention to the integration of reading the newspaper with production. The editorial department is also preparing to write a commentary on this issue. In order to lead and improve the reading groups in a timely manner, we have decided to open an irregular "Reading Life" column on the newspaper page. Shaanxi Daily Correspondent Reading Group

    Shanxi Tunliu Zhangbamiao Village Reading Group Implements Field Reading to Improve Production Enthusiasm
    Comrade Editor: The reading group in Zhangbamiao Village, Fifth District, Tunliu, Shanxi, was not doing well in the past. The main reason was that the village cadres, dominated by the task viewpoint, organized the masses to read the newspaper by means of coercion and command, so the masses were very dissatisfied. For example, during the busy farming season, the masses worked in the fields all day, and they needed to rest early at night, but the cadres called people from door to door to listen to the newspaper in order to complete the reading task, and as a result, not many people came, and those who listened were not energetic.
    Based on the above situation, the district cadres proposed the method of "field reading." This not only provided time for reading the newspaper, but also boosted everyone's enthusiasm for production. When the Guo Jizi mutual aid group was digging a well, they read the news about American imperialism spreading bacteria in Korea and our Northeast region, and everyone hated it extremely. Some wanted to go to Korea to directly fight the American devils; others said, "We must do a good job in drought prevention and resistance and strive for this year's bumper harvest to support the volunteer army!" The people of the Fan Shoufu and Fan Xiangui mutual aid group initially wanted to open a canal to irrigate 300 acres of land, but they did not have confidence. After reading the newspaper at the construction site, they were encouraged and learned about the benefits of turning dry land into paddy fields, so they were determined to make the canal a success. Currently, all thirteen mutual aid groups in Zhangbamiao Village have adopted this method of "field reading," which has played a great role in promoting drought prevention and resistance and spring plowing production.

    Propaganda Department of the Tong County Party Committee
    Leadership of Reading Groups Should Be Restored
    Comrade Editor: From May 1950 to March 1951, the Propaganda Department of the Tong County Party Committee, CPC, vigorously carried out the work of reading groups among district and village cadres and the broad masses of farmers, which played a certain role in promoting various central tasks at that time. The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee also informed and promoted the experience and achievements of Tong County Prefecture in carrying out reading group work throughout the province. However, since the abolition of local communications organizations last April (changed to Hebei Daily reporters' stations), the Propaganda Department of the Tong County Party Committee and its subordinate county party committees have rarely paid attention to this work, so that most of the reading groups have become self-flowing due to lack of leadership, or have collapsed altogether.
    According to our recent investigation in rural areas: newspapers are subscribed to in general villages, but the learning situation is very bad. In most villages, only a few cadres or a few literate people still read the newspaper every day, and the broad masses of people have no access to the newspaper at all; newspapers in some villages are discarded as soon as they arrive, or even used to wrap things and paste windows; very few villages can regularly read the newspaper to the masses. We believe that establishing reading groups in rural areas is a very important task. The Propaganda Department of the Tong County Party Committee should quickly restore leadership of the reading groups. Wen Chu

    读报组活动
    陕西日报领导读报组解决读报和生产结合的问题
    人民日报读者来信组：中央人民政府政务院发出防旱抗旱运动的指示后，我们随即在报纸上发表了给读报组的信，动员他们在读报组的基础上组织互助组，参加这一运动；并要求读报组利用各种形式，向群众宣传防旱抗旱的道理。最近我们收到不少读报组的来信，他们都表示要积极参加这一运动，以做好防旱抗旱工作的实际行动，打击美帝国主义撒布细菌的罪行。他们学习了报纸上有关防旱抗旱的文章，进行了讨论，订出了具体计划。长安延秋门村十四个读报组召开了老农座谈会，用以前农民遭受灾害的事例，克服了某些农民“靠天吃饭”的麻痹思想，并且互相介绍了防旱抗旱的经验和办法。目前全村群众都积极投入了这一运动。咸阳六区过唐乡东南坊村妇女读报组发动全村一百九十六个妇女，组成了十八个妇女互助组，把全村麦田锄了二遍，又把十七顷八十六亩棉田碾了一遍，腾出男劳动力修好了两个涝池。长安县渭滨区东扬善村读报组到七、八个村子里去放映“土电影”，这对农村防旱抗旱工作起了很大的推动作用。
    给我们来信的读报组一般都是互助组，参加读报组的农民，在一起生产，在一起读报，并联系实际情况进行讨论。如长安子午区花园村韩农元读报组（也是互助组）上地锄麦时，就带着报纸，利用休息时间读报。有一次，组长提出“锄地为啥能保墒”的问题，发动大家讨论。当大家的意见有分歧时，读报员就拿出报纸来念，大家听懂了道理，都高兴的说：“咱们还要锄第二遍啦！”这些读报组由于把读报和生产紧密地结合起来，确实起了很大的作用。但就全省来说，大部分读报组还没有作到这一步。所以我们最近又给各县委宣传部发了一封信，希望他们注意读报和生产相结合的问题。编辑部还准备就此问题写一篇评论。为了及时地领导和提高读报组，我们已决定在报面上辟一不定期的“读报生活”栏。陕西日报通讯读报组
    山西屯留丈八庙村读报组实行地头读报提高生产热情
    编辑同志：山西屯留五区丈八庙村的读报组，在过去搞得很不好。主要原因是村干部在任务观点支配下，用强迫命令的方式组织群众读报，因此群众很不满意。比如：农忙时群众在地里干了一天活，黑夜就需要早点休息，但干部为了完成读报任务，挨门挨户叫人来听报，结果是来的人不多，听的人没劲。
    区干部根据上述情况，提出了“地头读报”的办法。这样，既有了读报的时间，又鼓舞了大家的生产热情。郭计子互助组在打井的时候，读了美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北地区撒布细菌的消息，大家都痛恨极了。有人要到朝鲜去直接打美国鬼子；有的说：“咱们要做好防旱抗旱工作，争取今年的丰收，支持志愿军！”范守富、范先贵互助组的人们，最先想开一条浇三百亩地的水渠，但没有信心，经过工地读报，鼓起了劲头，知道了旱田变水田的利益，就决心要把水渠开成功。目前，丈八庙村的十三个互助组都采取了这种“地头读报”的办法，在推动防旱抗旱和春耕生产上起了很大的作用。
            屯留丈八庙村长　范高升
    中共通县地委宣传部
    应当恢复对读报组的领导
    编辑同志：中共通县地委宣传部从一九五○年五月至一九五一年三月将近一年中，曾在区村干部及广大农民中大力开展读报组工作，这对当时所进行的各项中心工作，起了一定的推动作用。河北省委宣传部也曾把通县专区开展读报组工作的经验和成绩，向全省通报推广。但自去年四月各地通讯组织取消后（改为河北日报记者站），通县地委宣传部及所属县委宣传部对这项工作就很少过问了，以致大部分读报组由于缺乏领导而形成自流状态，或者根本垮台了。
    根据我们最近下乡了解：一般村庄都订有报纸，但是学习情况是很不好的。大部村庄只有少数干部或几个识字的人，每天还看看报，广大的群众根本接触不到报纸；有些村庄的报纸随来随丢，甚至用来包东西、糊窗户；能经常给群众念念报纸的村子为数很少。我们认为在农村建立读报组是一件很重要的工作。通县地委宣传部应该迅速恢复对读报组的领导。　　　　文　矗
