To the Editor:

In the winter of last year, the Huangsang District of Xiao County, Anhui Province, completed land reform. After implementing land reform, confirming land ownership, and issuing land certificates in this area, it should have mobilized the masses to shift to spring plowing and production. However, the leading departments in this area relaxed their leadership over production, leading to the phenomenon of continuous opera performances in some villages, disregarding production. For example, villages such as Zhaolou, Guanqiao, and Baitu in the district delayed production due to taking turns performing operas. Some township and village cadres in these areas also spent their days watching operas, neglecting their work. It is hoped that the relevant leading institutions will quickly correct this behavior, which seriously affects spring plowing and production.

    建议皖北萧县领导机关
    纠正忽视领导生产的偏向
    编辑同志：皖北萧县黄桑区在去年冬季完成土地改革。这个地区在实行了土地改革、确定了地权并颁发了土地证以后，本应发动群众，转入春耕生产；但是这个地区的领导部门却放松了对生产的领导，以致在若干村中发生连续唱戏，不顾生产的现象。如该区赵楼、官桥、白土等村，曾因轮番唱戏耽误了生产。这些地区的若干乡、村干部也有整日看戏，不管工作的现象。这种严重影响春耕生产的行为，希望有关领导机构迅速纠正。    白令
