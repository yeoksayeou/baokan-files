    Graduation of the Construction Class of the Northeast Workers' Political University
    Comrade Gao Gang Gives Important Instructions on Basic Construction
    More than 800 students of the construction class of the Northeast Workers' Political University graduated on April 11. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, attended the graduation meeting and gave important instructions on the current basic construction work.
    The Great Significance of Basic Construction
    Gao Gang first expounded on the great significance of basic construction.
    He said: Basic construction is related to the consolidation of our national defense and the safety of the people. The importance of national defense construction, and that national defense construction can only be done well and not badly, are all very clear principles and need no further explanation.
    Secondly, basic construction is also related to the future of our national construction. Only when we build power stations can many factories start operating; only when more steel is produced can we manufacture cars and tractors; only when flax mills and textile mills are built will there be more cloth; and only when shafts and open-pit mines are built will there be more coal. If the country is to be industrialized, it must build many factories and install many machines. Only in this way can we move towards socialism day by day and enable the people to live the happiest life. Without modern large-scale industry, socialism cannot be achieved.
    Basic construction is also related to the progress and growth of our science and culture. We must build engineering colleges, agricultural colleges, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, middle schools, normal schools, etc., well, and cultivate many agricultural experts, engineers, and artistic talents, so that the level of science, culture, and art in our country will be improved. Doing these things well is doing great things for the country.
    Basic construction is also related to the improvement of people's living and living conditions, such as the construction of workers' dormitories, urban construction, sanatoriums, nurseries, clubs, and cultural palaces. Chairman Gao Gang criticized that some places are currently designing second-class brick houses (more expensive than first-class ones), some have toilets built next to the dining hall, and some have gates facing northeast, which affects the health of workers. The trolleybus road newly built in Shenyang last year was not up to standard, and it is being renovated everywhere this year, forming a great waste. Chairman Gao Gang said: Dormitories and municipal construction are very important and must be done well. Sanatoriums must also be built well, and cultural palaces, clubs, nurseries, and rest rooms must all be built well. Our working class is doing things for ourselves, and we must do them well.
    At this point, Gao Gang said to all the students: You see, how important is basic construction! It is related to the consolidation of our national defense, the future of industrial construction, the development of science and culture, and the improvement of people's lives. Therefore, everyone should no longer look at basic construction with the old eyes, thinking that it is just building houses, being a bricklayer or stonemason, and there is nothing to it. In fact, the quality and speed of basic construction are related to the speed of national industrialization and the future of socialism. Therefore, we must do it quickly and well, without waste, and without allowing others to cut corners. He encouraged all the students: If you do these things well, you will be doing glorious things for socialism. Your work is glorious because you directly increase wealth for society and constantly expand the country's production power. When you build a shaft, you can produce coal; when you build a power plant, you can produce electricity; when you build a car factory, you can produce cars; when you build a textile factory, you can produce cloth. When factories are built well, they can constantly produce things, and the material life of mankind will continue to improve. Human production and life must always develop and improve. In socialist and communist societies, we still have to build new factories and produce more things. Therefore, basic construction is the most promising and far-reaching work.
    Because basic construction is so important, the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast People's Government have decided that the people's governments of all provinces and cities and all departments engaged in basic construction must this year raise the work of leading basic construction to the same important position as leading production, and use half of their strength to do this. This year's basic construction tasks are heavy, the scale is large, and the state's investment is large, but our manpower and materials are not sufficient. Therefore, after the students of the construction class go back, they must play a good organizational role, educational role, and exemplary role.
    The Guidelines and Tasks of Basic Construction
    Next, the guidelines and tasks of basic construction were elaborated.
    Gao Gang said: In basic construction, national defense construction and heavy industry construction are in the first place, light industry and the construction of increasing production capacity are in the second place, and others are in the third place. The government's allocation of manpower, materials, and funds is in accordance with this order.
    Gao Gang said: There are many "tigers" in the basic construction department, and everyone must pay attention. Once corruption is discovered, it must be exposed. They are absolutely not allowed to sell steel bars, steal wires, so that factories cannot produce after they are built. We must call on all workers and staff to not take a brick, a wire, a bit of cement, or a switch from the public, not to waste, not to be corrupt, not to steal anything from the country, and not to cut corners. In basic construction, we must promote advanced experience, improve labor efficiency, save raw materials, and ensure good quality, and strive to reduce project costs by 10% to 15%. Everyone must work hard in the direction of "faster, better, and more economical"!
    In order to achieve the above requirements, the following three tasks must be done well:
    First of all, we must strengthen the design work, conduct thorough geological surveys, and all designs must go through the procedures of review and approval to avoid waste. Projects that have not been approved by the government are not allowed to allocate materials and land. Phenomena such as demolishing and repairing, repairing and demolishing, like the Agricultural College last year, must never be allowed to happen again.
    The second is to strengthen the planning of the project and the management and leadership of the construction site. Materials must be prepared to ensure that there is no stoppage of work waiting for materials. It is necessary to check whether bricks, tiles, water pipes, wires, wood, etc. meet the specifications. It is necessary to rectify engineering companies and construction teams. Last year, many unscrupulous merchants, foremen, and scammers who did not understand the industry mixed into the construction team, cheating and harming people everywhere, cutting corners, and deducting wages. We must clean up these bad guys, abolish the foreman system, and select activists from the workers to be group leaders. The group leader system must be implemented, and the foreman system must be abolished. It is necessary to train technical personnel and encourage everyone to actively study technology. Workers must be educated to abide by labor discipline, not to take anything from the public, and to improve their construction capabilities. It is necessary to unify the allocation of labor. The wage standards promulgated by the government must be resolutely implemented to eliminate the phenomenon of worker mobility. It is necessary to strengthen the management and leadership of the construction site, and to check every day and at all times, and correct problems immediately. Don't check after it is repaired. By then, if it is found that the roof is leaking and the pillars are crooked, it will be too late. Demolishing and rebuilding is a serious waste. It is necessary to establish some necessary systems, implement the responsibility system, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. At this point, Chairman Gao Gang emphasized again: Within the scope of possibility, the living conditions of workers should be improved, even simple wooden houses should be built to avoid workers running far and getting tired; workers should also be taken care of when they are sick; in short, health, medicine, accommodation and other matters should be taken care of as much as possible.
    The third is to strengthen political work in basic construction, strengthen trade union work, and the work of the Party and the Youth League. The trade union should vigorously organize and carry out labor competitions, vigorously promote the advanced experience of Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, and Yang Dezhong, promote workers to learn from the advanced, improve technology, and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class. Not only should the "foreman" system be abolished in terms of organization, but also the "foreman" system should be opposed in terms of ideology and style, democratic style should be promoted, and attention should be paid to the welfare of construction workers. In terms of the work of the Party, wherever conditions permit, branches and propaganda networks should be established. It is necessary to educate workers in socialism and communism. It is necessary to unify the steps of the Party committee, administration, trade union and Youth League. A construction site management committee should be established to absorb activists from the workers to participate and implement management democratization. We will use this working method and organizational form to complete this year's basic construction tasks.
    The Task Will Surely Be Successfully Completed
    Finally, Gao Gang said: This year, the Northeast has started large-scale construction with emphasis. Soon, larger-scale construction will be launched across the country, with railways being built everywhere, factories being built, and mines being opened. In the future, steel mills, oil factories, machine factories, tractor factories, automobile factories, locomotive factories, and national defense industries will be built a lot, the economy will be more developed, the national defense will be more consolidated, and the people's lives will be improved. Basic construction is so important, we must do it well. In the past, we did not have more than 800 people gathered together specifically to be trained in basic construction as we do today. Since you have been trained first, you must first gain some experience. Chairman Gao Gang encouraged the students present: You are all project captains, group leaders, trade union cadres, and labor models. After you go back, you must be as lively as dragons and tigers, complete your tasks, and set an example. If one person among you plays a role in a construction site, more than 800 construction sites can be done well this year. If you do more than 800 well in one year, and then do more than 800 well in another year, and do it better each time, our basic construction tasks will surely be successfully completed!
    Note: The construction class of the Northeast Workers' Political University started in early February this year, with more than 800 students, all of whom were drawn from the construction industry in various provinces and cities in the Northeast. Among them, in addition to a few people who are grassroots trade union chairmen, project captains, group leaders, and technical personnel, most are trade union members and activists among the workers who do not leave production. Famous labor models such as Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, Yang Dezhong, and Yu Donghai also participated in this study. Now this group of backbones among construction workers has been assigned to various basic construction departments, more than half of whom will serve as trade union chairmen or project captains and group leaders.

    东北工人政治大学建筑班结业
    高岗同志对基本建设作重要指示
    东北工人政治大学建筑班八百多名学员于四月十一日结业；东北人民政府主席高岗参加了结业会，对目前基本建设工作作了重要指示。
    基本建设的重大意义
    高岗首先阐述了基本建设的重大意义。
    他说：基本建设关系到我们国防的巩固和人民的安全。国防建设的重要，国防建设只许搞好不许搞坏，这些道理都是很明白的，不需要再加说明。
    其次，基本建设还关系到我们国家的建设前途。我们修起了发电站，许多工厂方能开工；钢出得多了，才能够制造汽车、拖拉机；建设了亚麻厂、纺织厂，布就多了；修起了竖井和露天矿，煤就多了。国家要工业化，就要建设很多的工厂，安装很多的机器。只有这样，我们才能一天天地走上社会主义，使人民过最幸福的生活。没有近代的大工业，就不能达到社会主义。
    基本建设还关系到我们科学、文化的进步和增长。我们要把工学院、农学院、鲁迅文艺学院、中学校、师范学校等等修好，培养出很多农业专家、工程师、艺术人才，我们国家的科学、文化、艺术水平就提高了。把这些做好，就是给国家做了大事情。
    基本建设还关系到人民居住和生活条件的改善，如职工宿舍，都市建设，疗养院，托儿所，俱乐部，文化宫的建设。高岗主席批评目前有些地方设计的二等砖房（比一等的还贵）有的把厕所盖在食堂旁边，有的大门朝着东北方，影响职工的卫生和健康。沈阳去年新修的无轨电车路，不合规格，今年到处翻修，形成很大的浪费。高岗主席说：宿舍、市政建设都是很重要的，一定要搞好。疗养院也要盖好，文化宫、俱乐部、托儿所、休养室都要修好。我们工人阶级给我们自己办事，一定要办好。
    至此，高岗向全体学员说：你们看，基本建设是如何要紧吧！它关系着我们国防的巩固，工业建设的前途，科学文化的发展，人民生活的改善。因此，大家不应再以旧的眼光来看基本建设，认为只是盖盖房子，当一个瓦工石匠，没有什么。其实，基本建设的好坏、快慢，关系着国家工业化的速度，关系着社会主义前途。因此我们一定要做得又快又好，不要浪费，不要让别人偷工减料。他勉励全体学员说：你们把这些事情做好，就是为社会主义做了光荣的事情。你们的工作所以光荣，是因为你们直接给社会增加了财富，并不断为国家扩大了生产的力量。你们修好了竖井，就可以出煤；修好了发电厂，就可以出电；修好汽车厂就出汽车；修好纺织厂就出布。工厂建设好了，就可以不断地生产东西，人类的物质生活就会不断地提高。人类的生产和生活是总要发展和提高的，到了社会主义和共产主义社会，还是要建设新工厂，生产更多的东西。所以说，基本建设这件工作是最有前途的，是前途最远大的工作。
    因为基本建设这样重要，所以东北局和东北人民政府作了决定，要各省市的人民政府和进行基本建设的一切部门，今年要把领导基本建设的工作提到与领导生产同样重要的地位，要用一半的力量来做这件事。今年基本建设的任务很重，规模很大，国家的投资很多，但是我们的人手和材料都不充分。因此，建筑班的学员们回去以后，就要很好地起组织作用、教育作用与模范作用。
    基本建设的方针和任务
    接着，阐述了基本建设的方针和任务。
    高岗说：在基本建设中，国防建设与重工业建设是第一位，轻工业与增长生产能力的建设是第二位，其他是第三位。政府对人力、材料、资金的分配，都是按照这样的次序。
    高岗说：基本建设部门的“老虎”是不少的，大家千万要注意。一发现贪污，就要把它搞出来。绝不允许他们卖钢筋、偷电线，以致修起工厂来不能生产。我们要号召所有的工人、职员，不拿公家的一块砖、一节电线、一点水泥、一个开关，不浪费、不贪污、不偷窃一点国家的东西、不偷工减料。在基本建设中要推广先进经验，提高劳动效率，节省原材料，保证质量好，要争取降低工程成本百分之十到十五。大家都要向“又快、又好、又省”的方向努力！
    为了要达到上述要求，必须做好下面三件工作：
    首先就要加强设计工作，要周密勘察地质，一切设计都要经过审查和批准的手续，以避免浪费。没有经过政府批准的工程，一律不许拨给材料和地皮。像去年农学院那样拆了又修，修了又拆的现象决不允许再发生。
    第二就要加强工程的计划性与施工现场的管理领导。要准备好材料，保证不发生停工待料现象。要检查砖瓦、水管、电线、木材等是不是合乎规格。要整顿工程公司与工程队。去年有许多的奸商、把头、不懂得行道的骗子混到工程队里来，到处骗人害人，偷工减料、克扣工资。我们要把这些坏家伙洗刷干净，废除把头制度，从工人中选拔积极分子当组长。要实行组长制，取消把头制。要训练技术人才，鼓励大家积极钻研技术。要对工人进行教育，教育他们遵守劳动纪律，不拿公家一点东西，提高施工的能力。要统一劳动力的调配。要坚决执行政府颁布的工薪标准，消灭工人的流动现象。要加强施工现场的管理领导，要天天检查、时时检查，发现毛病立即纠正，不要修好了再检查，到那时发现房盖漏了，柱子歪了，已经迟了，拆了重修，就是一种严重的浪费。要建立一些必要的制度，贯彻责任制，消灭那种无人负责现象。至此，高岗主席又着重指出：要在可能的范围内改善工人的生活条件，那怕是简单的木头房子也要盖，免得工人跑得很远，弄得很累；工人生病也要管；总之，卫生、医药、住宿等事情都要尽可能管好。
    第三要加强基本建设中的政治工作，加强工会工作和党与青年团的工作。工会要大力组织开展劳动竞赛，大力推广苏长有、谢万福、杨德重的先进经验，推动工人向先进的看齐，提高技术，把工人阶级的积极性、创造性组织起来。不仅要在组织上废止“把头”制，而且要从思想作风上反对“把头”制，发扬民主作风，注意建筑工人的福利。党的工作方面，凡是条件具备，能建立支部与宣传网的，都要建立。要向工人进行社会主义、共产主义的教育。要统一党委、行政、工会与青年团的步调。要成立工地管理委员会，吸收工人中的积极分子参加，实行管理民主化。我们就要以这种工作方法与组织形式，来完成今年的基本建设任务。
    任务一定能够胜利完成
    最后，高岗说：今年东北已开始了有重点的大规模建设，不久全国就要展开更大规模的建设，到处修铁路、盖工厂、开矿山。将来炼钢工厂、石油工厂、机器工厂、拖拉机工厂、汽车工厂、火车头工厂，还有国防工业等等，都修起很多很多，经济更发展了，国防更巩固了，人民生活也就更提高了。基本建设的关系这样重大，我们一定要好好干。过去我们还没有像今天这样，八百多个人集中在一起，专门受训练搞基本建设。你们既然先受了训练，就要先摸出些经验来。高岗主席勉励到会的学员说：你们都是工程队长、组长、工会干部、劳动模范，回去以后，要像生龙活虎一样，完成任务，做出模范。一个工地有你们一个人发挥作用，今年就能搞好八百多个工地。一年搞好八百多个，再一年再搞好八百多个，一次比一次搞得更好，我们的基本建设任务一定是能够胜利完成的！
    按：东北工人政治大学建筑班系于今年二月初开学，学员共八百多名，都是由东北各省市建筑业中抽调的。其中除少数人是基层工会主席、工程队长、组长及技术人员外，大部都是不脱离生产的工会委员和工人中的积极分子。著名的劳动模范苏长有、谢万福、杨德重、于东海等也都参加了这次的学习。现在这批建筑工人中的骨干已被分配到各个基本建设部门中去，其中半数以上将担任工会主席或工程队长、组长的职务。
