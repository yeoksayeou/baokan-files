    We Protest the Austrian Reactionaries' Persecution of Peace Warrior Professor Brandweiner
    To the Editor: Peace warrior, head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, Professor Brandweiner, has recently been persecuted by the Austrian reactionary government. Under the direction of its American master, the Austrian reactionary government has dismissed Brandweiner from his professorship at the University of Graz. With boundless anger, we lodge a serious protest against this shameless act of open persecution of Brandweiner by the Austrian reactionaries, and express our warm concern and condolences to Professor Brandweiner!
    Professor Brandweiner made a brilliant contribution to the cause of peace for all mankind in this investigation. He told the people of the world about the facts he witnessed in Korea and Northeast China: American imperialists are seriously violating international law and are waging a heinous germ warfare. Professor Brandweiner once came to our school and spoke to all our teachers and students. He told us that reactionary newspapers had slandered his sacred work as "anti-Austrian behavior" in an attempt to persecute him, "but," he said, "when I saw the full fighting will and perseverance of the Chinese and Korean people, I felt that this slander was insignificant. As long as my work makes even a small contribution to the cause of defending world peace, I will insist on my work and fight to the end!"
    This act of open persecution of a peace warrior by the Austrian reactionaries fully demonstrates how ferocious American imperialism and its running dogs are in their declining days; at the same time, it shows how fearful they are of the strength of the forces of peace for mankind.
    We firmly believe that peace-loving people all over the world are supporting Professor Brandweiner, and victory will surely be ours!

    我们抗议奥地利反动派迫害和平战士布兰德魏纳教授
    编辑同志：和平战士、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长布兰德魏纳教授最近遭到了奥地利反动政府的迫害。奥地利反动政府在它的美国主子的指使下，免去了布兰德魏纳在格拉茨大学的教授职位。我们以无比愤怒的心情，对奥地利反动派这种公开迫害布兰德魏纳的无耻行为提出严重抗议，并对布兰德魏纳教授表示亲切的关怀和慰问！
    布兰德魏纳教授在这次调查工作中，对于全人类的和平事业作了辉煌的贡献。他把在朝鲜和中国东北目击的事实告诉了全世界人民：美帝国主义者严重地违反了国际公法，正在进行着罪恶的细菌战。布兰德魏纳教授曾经来我校向我校全体师生讲过话。他告诉我们，反动报纸曾诬蔑他的神圣工作为“反奥地利行为”，企图迫害他，“但是”，他说，“当我看到中朝两国人民饱满的战斗意志和毅力时，我感到这种诽谤的微不足道。我的工作对于保卫世界和平事业只要有一点贡献，我就要坚持我的工作，斗争到底！”
    奥地利反动派这种公开迫害和平战士的行为，充分说明了美帝国主义及其走狗，在他们日趋没落的时候是如何的凶残；同时，对于人类和平力量的强大又是怎样的恐惧。
    我们坚信：全世界爱好和平的人民在支持着布兰德魏纳教授，胜利一定是我们的！
