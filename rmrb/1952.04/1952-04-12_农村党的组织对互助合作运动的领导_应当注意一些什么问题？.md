What Issues Should Rural Party Organizations Pay Attention to When Leading the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement?
中共黑龙江省委办公室主任  张士英
    The Party's basic policy in rural areas, and the basic direction of rural economic development in New China, is to organize farmers, develop cooperation and mutual assistance, and guide the agricultural economy towards collectivization and mechanization in a planned and step-by-step manner. Chairman Mao said long ago: "As far as the peasant masses are concerned, they have been engaged in individual economy for thousands of years. Each household is a production unit. This kind of scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, which makes the peasants suffer from poverty forever. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives."

    How should our rural Party organizations organize Party members and the peasant masses to realize Chairman Mao's instructions?

    First, we must strengthen the Party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement and oppose right-leaning ideas and laissez-faireism. Due to the rapid recovery and development of the rural economy after the land reform, the middle peasants have become the majority in the countryside, especially the vast majority of rural Party members have become middle peasants, and labor mutual aid and production cooperation have not been rapidly improved along with economic development to make labor mutual aid adapt to the needs of agricultural production and solve the requirements of peasants to expand reproduction; therefore, some rural Party members believe that: "Production has developed, the difficulties of peasant production have been overcome, peasants can work on their own, and mutual aid is no longer necessary to be led." This is a right-leaning view. Comrades with this view do not understand that organizing can not only overcome production difficulties, but also only organizing can meet the requirements of peasants to expand reproduction and enable the vast majority of peasants to get rid of poverty and become rich. Moreover, after peasants become prosperous, they do not no longer need mutual aid and cooperation, but are no longer satisfied with the existing lower-level "inter-plowing and exchange of labor" and other simple forms of mutual aid, and demand further improvement and development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Facts have proved that since many local leading organs put forward the policy of combining the development of labor mutual aid with the improvement of production technology and the solution of supply and marketing problems, and implementing year-round mutual aid groups that combine agriculture and sideline occupations, and experimentally running agricultural production cooperatives with leadership and focus, the enthusiasm of peasants to participate in mutual aid and cooperation has been generally improved. This shows that the view of disregarding the policy of mutual aid and cooperation is completely wrong. Secondly, some district and village Party cadres, because they do not understand that the development of mutual aid and cooperation is the basic direction of agricultural economic development, and do not understand the important significance of mutual aid and cooperation for the development of production, have made the mistake of relaxing leadership - laissez-faireism. Some rural district committees and branches in Northeast China publicized to the peasants: "Organizing is okay, working on your own is also okay, as long as you plant the land." A rural cadre in Kaitong County, Heilongjiang, said at a mass meeting: "This year is not like last year. Find your own partner. If you want to join a group, join a group. If you want to work on your own, work on your own. If you want to hire someone, hire someone." A district committee in Zhaodong publicized: "Voluntary joint groups, three horses are okay, two horses are okay, working on your own is okay, hiring someone is okay." Under the domination of this right-leaning view, some Party members and middle peasants have developed the sentiment of pursuing free development and free competition. Some rural cadres even only take care of the interests of the rapidly rising wealthy peasants and rarely care about the poor households; they wrongly say that the poor households are "useless," and say: "Everyone turned over, everyone divided the land, why is he poor?" Under the domination of right-leaning ideas, the phenomenon of usury and commercial speculation in rural areas has also seen new development. A small number of peasants and Party members do not use surplus grain and capital to expand reproduction, but want to "raise the price of lending money." They live the life of an exploiting class. Some Party members describe lending money at high interest rates as "supporting poor households." Rural Party organizations must resolutely oppose this kind of capitalist exploitation thinking existing within the Party. We must strengthen the communist and collectivist education of rural Party members and peasants, establish the idea of "organizing, working hard, and everyone becoming rich," and link the education on the direction of rural economic development with the Party rectification education carried out in the Party branches. Rural Party branches must repeatedly publicize to the peasants the benefits of organizing, actively promote organizing mutual aid production, and oppose the right-leaning idea of laissez-faireism. Every Party member has the responsibility to persuade peasants who work on their own to actively participate in cooperation and mutual aid under voluntary conditions, so that the peasants understand that only by organizing can agricultural productivity be improved and a prosperous life be lived. Party branches must systematically support poor households and must never allow the exclusion of poor peasants and households in difficulty. They must be absorbed into mutual aid and cooperation, and the state banks should also give them the necessary loan assistance to enable them to rise rapidly economically, and not allow the class differentiation in the countryside. Communist Party members with surplus grain and capital should invest in mutual aid groups, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit departments to expand production and supply and marketing, and should not engage in usury and speculative activities. In short, strengthening the Party's leadership is the basic key to the development of rural mutual aid and cooperation.

    Second, the rural Party district committees and branches should educate Party members to take the lead in actively participating in mutual aid groups. It should be pointed out that some Party members still have incorrect understandings of mutual aid organizations: some Party members believe that "mutual aid groups are to pull up the poor," and say that "Party members participating in mutual aid groups must suffer losses," while others eat and drink extravagantly and passively "wait for society (socialism)." According to statistics from eleven districts in Keshan County last year, Party members who hired long-term workers accounted for 4.3 percent, and those who worked on their own accounted for 11 percent. They mistakenly believe that this is "taking the lead in development," "the one who does the work is stronger than the boss." This is the result of the bourgeoisie eroding the rural Party. We must criticize this erroneous thinking. We must make Party members and peasants understand that mutual aid groups are organized under the principle of equal value and mutual benefit. Communist Party members are to fight for the cause of communism to the end. Agriculture must be collectivized in order to improve productivity and steadily move towards a socialist society. Therefore, Communist Party members should not hire workers to work on their own and take the capitalist road, but should take the lead in doing a good job in various mutual aid and cooperation organizations with their own exemplary actions, so that agricultural production is gradually collectivized.

    Third, rural Party district committees and branches should pay attention to cultivating models of labor, establishing banners, and educating the masses. We must guide the peasants to organize and move towards collectivization. We cannot adopt the method of coercion and command. We must adopt the method of typical demonstration and gradual promotion, and use facts to educate the peasants, so that the peasants realize that organizing can produce more grain than working on their own, and that the collective economy is superior to the individual economy. But it must be noted that, except in special circumstances, the work of mutual aid groups can generally only develop gradually from small to large, from less to more, and from low to high; therefore, every rural cadre must focus on cultivating one or two good year-round mutual aid groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations as examples. Only with good examples can we educate the masses and gradually expand the mutual aid movement. Some rural Party member cadres, regardless of the mutual aid foundation and the awareness of the masses and other conditions, believe that "sooner or later, we will be socialist," "going early is better than going late," so they arrange households one by one and force the masses to engage in large group production and agricultural production cooperatives. They wrongly publicized: "Organizing to exchange labor and mutual aid is not a new road. Only engaging in large groups and collectivization is a new road." "A plow group with six horses is not a mutual aid group." "Eliminate small groups and rush to socialism." Under the domination of this erroneous thinking, they oppose small mutual aid, purely pursue form, do not pay attention to improving and enriching the content of mutual aid groups, and attempt to quickly embark on large-scale collectivization. If this "left" thinking is not resolutely opposed and promptly corrected, it will inevitably affect the production enthusiasm of the peasants and hinder the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    In order to gradually improve the mutual aid and cooperation movement with emphasis, rural Party organizations must regard the work of leading mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives as one of the regular basic tasks; and oppose the practice of "relaxing in spring and summer and letting go in autumn." At the same time, the Party leading organs of counties and districts must convene meetings of mutual aid group leaders regularly every quarter to summarize and exchange experience in increasing production and carry out a bumper harvest competition movement. The district committees should systematically train mutual aid group backbones and cultivate mutual aid and cooperation cadres.

    Fourth, implement the policy of equal value and mutual benefit. Due to the development of the rural economy, wealthy peasants with more vehicles, horses, and agricultural implements are prone to occupy a leading position in mutual aid groups. They rent in more land and exchange a large amount of labor from poor households with unequal exchange (high wages for horse labor, low wages for manual labor, low wages within the group, high wages outside the group); some peasants cannot join the group because their horses are weak, or they sell their livestock at low prices because they cannot afford to feed them, and hire other people's cattle to plow the land, but they must pay rent for hiring cattle, which increases the burden on poor households, and even forces them to rent out their land, while wealthy households take this opportunity to expand their cultivated area; some new wealthy peasants and prosperous middle peasants hire long-term workers to participate in mutual aid groups, which develops capitalist exploitation relationships within the mutual aid groups and restricts the rise of poor peasants in mutual aid and cooperation. This will arouse the dissatisfaction of the poor peasants participating in the mutual aid group. However, some district and village leading comrades do not support the poor peasants and mobilize the masses to correct this unreasonable and unequal situation, but only take care of the interests of economically rising households. This is wrong. Party organizations must pay attention to leading the masses to correct the capitalist tendencies in mutual aid groups. On the one hand, they must oppose the tendency of only talking about unity and not talking about mutual benefit and infringing on the interests of middle peasants; on the other hand, they must oppose unequal exchange of labor, only taking care of the interests of middle peasants with horses, and making poor and households in difficulty suffer losses.

    农村党的组织对互助合作运动的领导应当注意一些什么问题？
    中共黑龙江省委办公室主任  张士英
    把农民组织起来，发展合作互助，有步骤地引导农业经济走向集体化和机械化，这是党在农村的基本政策，也是新中国农村经济发展的基本方向。毛主席早就说过：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一方法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”
    我们农村党的组织，如何组织党员和农民群众去实现毛主席的指示呢？
    首先是加强党对互助合作运动的领导，反对右倾思想和自流论。由于土地改革后农村经济的迅速恢复和发展，中农已成为农村的多数，特别是农村党员的绝大多数已成为中农，而劳动互助和生产合作又没有随着经济的发展迅速提高，使劳动互助适应农业生产的需要，解决农民扩大再生产的要求；因此一部分农村党员认为：“生产发展了，农民生产的困难已经克服，农民可以单干了，互助可以不要领导了。”这是一种右倾观点。有这种观点的同志不懂得组织起来不仅可以克服生产困难，而且只有组织起来才能满足农民扩大再生产的要求，使绝大多数农民摆脱贫困走向富裕。而农民在生活富裕以后，也不是不再需要互助合作，而是不再满足于已有的较低级的“插犋换工”和其他的简单互助形式，要求进一步地提高和发展互助合作运动。事实证明，自从很多地区领导机关提出发展劳动互助和提高生产技术、解决供销问题相结合，实行农业和副业相结合的长年互助组，有领导有重点地试办农业生产合作社的方针以后，农民参加互助合作的积极性已经普遍提高了。这就说明漠视互助合作政策的观点是完全错误的。其次，还有一部分区、村党员干部，由于不了解发展互助合作是农业经济发展的基本方向，不了解互助合作对发展生产的重要意义，因而发生了放松领导——放任自流的偏向。东北有些农村中共区委和支部向农民宣传说：“组织起来也行，单干也行，只要种上地就行。”黑龙江开通县有的农村干部在群众会上讲：“今年不像去年啦，自找对象，愿意插组就插组，愿意单干就单干，愿意雇人就雇人。”肇东一个区委宣传说：“自愿联组，三马也行，两马也行，单干也行，雇人也行。”由于这种右倾观点的支配，所以有的地方的党员和中农滋长了追求自由发展、自由竞争的情绪。有些农村干部甚至只照顾上升快的富裕农民的利益，对困难户很少关心；他们把困难户错误地说成是“熊蛋包”，并说：“一样翻身，一样分地，为什么他受穷？”由于右倾思想的支配，农村放高利贷和进行商业投机的现象也有了新的发展。少数农民和党员不把余粮余资用于扩大再生产，而想“抬高放账”。过剥削阶级的生活。有的党员把放高利贷说成“扶持困难户”。对于这种存在于党内的资本主义剥削思想，农村党的组织必须坚决地反对。必须加强对农村党员和农民的共产主义和集体主义的教育，树立“组织起来，勤劳生产，大家富裕”的思想，把对农村经济发展方向的教育和在党支部中进行的整党教育联系起来进行。农村党的支部必须反复向农民宣传组织起来的好处，积极提倡组织起来互助生产，反对放任自流的右倾思想。每个党员都有责任说服单干的农民在自愿条件下积极参加合作互助，使农民懂得只有组织起来才能提高农业生产力，才能过富裕生活。党的支部必须有计划地扶助困难户，决不允许排斥贫农困难户，要吸收他们参加互助合作，国家银行也应给他们以必要的贷款帮助，使他们在经济上迅速上升，不能听任农村阶级的分化。共产党员有余粮余资应投资到互助组、供销合作社和信贷部中来扩大生产和供销，而不应该放高利贷和进行商业投机倒把活动。总之，加强党的领导是发展农村互助合作的基本关键。
    第二、农村党的区委和支部应教育党员带头积极参加互助组。应该指出：部分党员对互助组织还有着不正确的认识：有的党员认为“互助组是拉拔穷人”，说“党员参加互助组一定要吃亏”，有的则大吃大喝消极地“等社会（主义）”。据去年克山县十一个区的统计，党员雇长工的占百分之四点三，单干的占百分之十一。他们错误地认为这是“带头发展”，“扛活的比东家都强”。这就是资产阶级思想对农村党的侵蚀的结果。我们必须批判这种错误的思想，必须使党员和农民了解，互助组是在等价互利原则下组织起来的。共产党员是要为共产主义事业奋斗到底的，农业必须实行集体化才能提高生产力，稳步地走向社会主义社会。因此，共产党员不应该雇工单干，走资本主义的道路，而应该以自己的模范行动，积极带头搞好各种互助合作组织，使农业生产逐步集体化。
    第三、农村党的区委和支部应注意培养劳动模范的典型，树立旗帜，教育群众。我们要引导农民组织起来走向集体化，不能采取强迫命令的方法，必须采取典型示范逐步推广的方法，用事实来教育农民，使农民认识到组织起来比单干能多打粮食，集体经济优于个体经济。但必须注意，除了特殊的情况以外，互助组工作一般只能是由小到大，由少到多，由低级到高级，逐步发展的；因此每个农村干部必须有重点地培养一两个好的农业副业结合的长年互助组做样子，有了好的样子才能教育群众，逐步扩展互助运动。有的农村党员干部不问互助基础和群众觉悟等条件，认为“早社会（主义），晚社会（主义），早晚都要到社会（主义）”“早走比晚走强”，因而挨户编排，强迫群众搞大组生产和农业生产合作社。他们错误地宣传：“组织起来换工互助不是新道路，只有搞大组，搞集体，才是新道路”，“六个马的扣犁组不算互助组”，“消灭小组奔社会（主义）”。在这种错误的思想支配下，他们反对小型互助，单纯追求形式，不注意去提高和充实互助组的内容，企图很快走上大规模的集体化，这种“左”的思想如不坚决加以反对，迅予纠正，势必影响农民的生产积极性和妨碍互助合作运动的发展。
    为了有重点地逐步提高互助合作运动，农村党的组织必须把领导互助组和农业生产合作社的工作，当做经常的基本的任务之一；反对“春夏松，秋撒手”的作法。同时，县区党的领导机关，必须按季定期召开互助组长会议，总结和交流增产经验，开展丰产竞赛运动，区委应有计划地训练互助组骨干，培养互助合作干部。
    第四、贯彻执行等价互利政策。由于农村经济的发展，车马农具多的富裕农民容易在互助组内占领导地位，他们租入较多的土地，用不等价交换（马工工资高，人工工资低，组内工资低，组外工资高）来换取困难户的大量劳动；有的农民因马弱插不上组，或因喂养不起，把牲口贱价卖掉，雇别人的牛犋种地，但是雇牛犋必须交租，这就使贫困户负担增加，甚至被迫出租土地，富裕户则乘此扩大耕种面积；有的新富农和富裕中农雇长工参加互助组，这就使互助组内发展了资本主义的剥削关系，限制了贫农在互助合作中的上升。这样就会引起参加互助组的贫农的不满，可是，某些区村领导同志不去支持贫农、发动群众纠正这种不合理不等价的情况，只是照顾经济上升户的利益，这是错误的。党的组织必须注意领导群众纠正互助组内资本主义的倾向，一方面必须反对只讲团结不讲两利、侵犯中农利益的偏向；另一方面必须反对不等价换工，只照顾中农有马户的利益，而使贫农困难户吃亏的偏向。
