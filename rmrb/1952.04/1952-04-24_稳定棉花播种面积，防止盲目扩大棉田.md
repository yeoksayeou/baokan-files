Economic Life Brief Commentary

    In the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural production in 1952, it was requested that this year's cotton production be increased by 20% compared to last year. The basic policy for increasing production is to concentrate efforts on improving yield per unit area. The planting area is not allowed to increase. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council also announced in mid-March a policy to adjust the cotton-grain price ratio and the burden of public grain on cotton fields to prevent the blind expansion of cotton fields. Judging from the current situation, many areas have conscientiously implemented the policy of stabilizing cotton field area. Many areas have reformulated cotton planting plans. After Hebei Province put forward the slogan "Planting more cotton last year was a manifestation of patriotism, and planting more grain this year is also a manifestation of patriotism," it persuaded many cotton farmers to plant according to the national plan. Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group, a model of cotton abundance in Shanxi, responded to the government's call and demanded that in addition to abundant cotton harvests, grain harvests should also be abundant. However, there are still many areas where the implementation of the policy of stabilizing cotton field area is not thorough enough, and has not been implemented down to the district and village level. For example, the policy of adjusting the cotton-grain price ratio and the burden on cotton and grain fields has not been earnestly and widely publicized to the masses in these areas. The leading organs in these districts have lost control of the cotton field planting area and tend to allow it to expand freely. According to a survey of four typical villages in Wanxian County, Hebei, the planned cotton planting area of cotton farmers exceeds the allocated acreage by more than double. Even more, some areas are increasing it at each level. For example, in the second district of Linfen, Shanxi, the county level assigned 35,000 mu of cotton planting, while the district level assigned 40,000 mu to the village level, and village-level cadres still promoted to the masses that "the more cotton planted, the better."

    Why is there still a trend of blindly expanding cotton fields in many areas? Some cadres in some areas believe that last year they told the masses to retain more cotton fields, and this year it is difficult to mobilize the masses to plant less because they are afraid of causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, they dare not publicize the central government's policy of adjusting the cotton-grain price ratio and the burden on cotton and grain fields. Some cadres in some areas still adopt the old experience of "only by increasing the task can the task be finally completed" and have not seen that the masses are now willing to plant more, not less.

    It is currently the cotton planting season, and various places are busily sowing. Therefore, all localities must quickly take effective measures to prevent the blind expansion of cotton fields.

    (1) It is necessary to correctly publicize the policy of adjusting the cotton-grain price ratio and the burden on cotton and grain fields so that this policy is known to every household. It is wrong not to publicize this policy to the masses. This is not in the interests of the state and the people, nor is it in the interests of the peasant masses. Failure to correctly publicize when planting cotton will also add many difficulties to the work of purchasing cotton and collecting agricultural taxes in the autumn. When publicizing and mobilizing, the slogan "Plant more patriotic cotton" should be changed to "Produce more patriotic cotton." It is necessary to strengthen technical guidance to cotton farmers, lead cotton farmers to improve cultivation techniques, and increase yield per unit area to ensure the completion of the cotton production increase plan. For the cotton fields that have been retained more, farmers should be called upon to switch to planting edible crops.

    (2) It is necessary to combine the pre-purchase work and implement the state's plan to stabilize the cotton field planting area to each cotton planting household, so that the state's plan and the farmers' plan are combined. Years of experience have proved that if the plan is not implemented to the household, the plan will fail; signing a pre-purchase contract is one of the important methods to promote the household's plan.

### 稳定棉花播种面积，防止盲目扩大棉田

    稳定棉花播种面积，防止盲目扩大棉田
    中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定中，要求今年的棉花产量比去年提高百分之二十。增产的基本方针是：集中力量提高单位面积产量。播种面积不许增加。政务院财政经济委员会并于三月中旬公布了调整棉粮比价及棉田公粮负担的政策，以防止盲目扩大棉田。根据目前情况来看，很多地区已认真贯彻稳定棉田面积的方针。许多地区重新制定了植棉计划。河北省提出了“去年多种棉是爱国的表现，今年多种粮食也是爱国的表现”的口号以后，说服了很多棉农按照国家计划进行播种。山西棉花丰产模范曲耀离互助组响应政府号召，要求除棉花丰产外，粮食也要做到丰产。但是，仍有不少地区对稳定棉田面积的方针的贯彻还不彻底，没有贯彻到区村。例如调整棉粮比价及棉田负担的政策，在这些地区就没有认真向群众广泛宣传。这些区的领导机关对棉田播种面积失去掌握，而有听任其自流扩大的趋势。根据河北完县四个典型村调查，棉农计划植棉面积超过布置亩数一倍以上。更有的地区在逐级加大。如山西临汾二区，县级布置植棉三万五千亩，而区级向村级布置四万亩，村级干部则仍向群众宣传“种棉越多越好”。
    为什么仍有不少地区有盲目扩大棉田的趋势呢？有的地区的干部认为去年叫群众多留了棉田，今年动员群众少种不好说，怕引起群众不满，因而对中央调整棉粮比价及棉田粮田负担的政策不敢宣传。也有的地区的干部仍采取过去的“只有加大任务，才能最后完成任务”的老一套的经验，而没有看到群众现在是愿意多种，而不是要少种。
    目前正是植棉季节，各地正在紧张地播种。因此，各地必须迅速采取有效办法，防止棉田盲目扩大。
    （一）必须正确宣传调整棉粮比价及棉田粮田负担的政策，使这个政策家喻户晓。不向群众宣传这个政策是不对的。这不符合国家人民的利益，也不符合农民群众的利益。种棉时不作正确宣传，也将会在秋后购棉和征收农业税时，给工作增加许多困难。在宣传动员时，应把“多种爱国棉”的口号改为“多产爱国棉”。要加强对棉农的技术指导，领导棉农改进耕作技术，提高单位面积产量，以保证完成棉花的增产计划。对于多留的棉田，要号召农民改种食用作物。
    （二）要结合预购工作，把国家稳定棉田播种面积的计划贯彻到各植棉户，使国家计划和农民的计划结合起来。几年来的经验证明，计划如不贯彻到户，这个计划就会落空；订立预购合同，是促使订立户计划的重要方法之一。
