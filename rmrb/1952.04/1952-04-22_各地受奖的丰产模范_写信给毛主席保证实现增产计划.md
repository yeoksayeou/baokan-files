The People of Yan's Village, Awarded the Glorious Title of "High-Yield Village," Guarantee a 15% Increase in Production Per Mu

    Respected Chairman Mao: After seeing the list of agricultural patriotic high-yield models for 1951 awarded by the Central Ministry of Agriculture, we jumped up with joy. We congratulate you, congratulate the labor models of high yield, and at the same time congratulate ourselves, because our entire village has won the glorious title of national "High-Yield Village."

    Dear Chairman Mao: We know that there are several reasons why we can get such a glorious title:

    First, we have your correct leadership. In 1949, our village implemented land reform and defeated feudal forces. Fifty-six poor farmers with little or no land were allocated land, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. Our village was the poorest before liberation. At that time, the village had only more than 600 mu of arable land and eleven livestock, two of which could not be used. Now the village's land has increased to 917 mu, and the livestock has increased to 52. The yield of cotton fields has increased from 240 jin before liberation to 433 jin, and the yield of dry cotton fields has increased from 45 jin to 156 jin. The lives of the villagers are improving day by day. Xu Zilai, Shi Tiancheng, Yan Laifa, and other five households who used to eat chaff and wild vegetables every year now eat white flour for two-thirds of the year; twelve farmers who used to work long hours for landlords are now working on their own land and have livestock and farm tools, and their lives are pretty good. More than 70 poor farmers in the village have risen to become middle peasants.

    Second, the party and the government's policy of rewarding labor mutual aid has powerfully encouraged us. Under the leadership of labor models Shi Caigui and Shao Shuanghe, the whole village has organized eight labor mutual aid groups, and more than 30% of the farmers have implemented collective labor. This makes it possible to carry out intensive farming. We have received various loan assistance from the government, and everyone has a foundation, which lays a favorable foundation for high yield.

    Third, the support of the working class. Last year, during the drought, the working class made a large number of new-style waterwheels, farm tools, and various medicines for us to use. The village bought back 34 new-style waterwheels, and the hand-operated windlasses that were used before were installed with new-style waterwheels, giving full play to the efficiency of water, and at the same time saving manpower for processing in the cotton fields. In the past, cotton fields were watered by manpower, and only one and a half mu could be watered every day. Last year, using new-style waterwheels to water, three mu could be watered every day; in the past, cotton fields were watered twice, and last year cotton fields were watered six times. Thus, the drought was overcome, and the high yield of cotton fields was guaranteed.

    Respected Chairman Mao: Although we have received the title of "High-Yield Village," we are not satisfied with this. Now our entire administrative village has organized 44 labor mutual aid groups and has begun to try to run agricultural production cooperatives. We respond to your call and the call of the People's Government, organize ourselves, prevent drought, and resist drought. Now we have dug 84 earth wells, which can guarantee timely sowing of 400 mu of land and can turn 200 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The village's production increase target for this year is to increase by 15% per mu compared to last year. This year, the village has more than 390 mu of paddy cotton fields, and it is planned to increase the average yield per mu from 433 jin last year to 498 jin; the village has 450 mu of dry cotton fields, and it is planned to increase the average yield per mu from 156 jin last year to 180 jin. In total, the village has more than 840 mu of paddy and dry cotton fields this year, and it is planned to produce more than 275,500 jin of seed cotton, an increase of more than 36,100 jin compared to last year. Chairman Mao: Please rest assured that we will never be complacent. The masses of our village are confident in achieving greater victories on the production front in 1952, responding to your call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and maintain the glorious title of our patriotic high-yield model village. Finally, all the cadres and masses of our village extend our highest revolutionary salute to you.

The Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Group, a High-Yield Model Group, Guarantees 1,300 Jin of Grain Per Mu of High-Yield Field

    Dear Chairman Mao: After seeing the news in the People's Daily about the Central Ministry of Agriculture issuing bonuses to patriotic high-yield models, and knowing that we—the Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Group—have gloriously won the award, we are extremely happy. We thank you and the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party.

    We must always maintain this honor. We guarantee to you that we must achieve the plan of producing 1,000 jin of grain per mu this year, and select three mu of land as a high-yield demonstration, producing 1,300 jin of grain per mu.
    All members of the Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Group

The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Guarantees a Harvest of 1,100 Jin of High-Yield Corn Per Mu

    Respected Chairman Mao: We feel infinitely honored after hearing the news that the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture announced the first batch of national agricultural high-yield model award winners and that our cooperative received a bonus of 2 million yuan. This is the result of our organization and improved technology under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government. We will use the bonus of 2 million yuan to buy another corn threshing machine, a hand-cranked flour milling machine, and forty sheep to expand reproduction. Our agricultural production cooperative has expanded from 18 households to 41 households; as a result of our water conservancy construction, we can now guarantee that all 300 mu of autumn land in the whole cooperative are sown with moisture conservation. We plan to produce an average of 600 jin of corn per mu and 450 jin of millet per mu. We will plant ten mu of high-yield corn, guaranteeing a production of 1,100 jin per mu. And build three public shed rooms, five houses, and two enclosure kilns. We put forward these conditions to challenge agricultural production cooperatives in the whole county and region and carry out the 1952 patriotic high-yield competition movement. We are determined to take practical actions to run the agricultural production cooperative well, complete the 1952 high-yield task, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and combat the heinous crimes of American imperialists using bacteriological weapons.

Wheat High-Yield Model Jin Kedian Guarantees an Increase of 58 Jin Per Mu on Three Mu of High-Yield Wheat Field

    Dear Chairman Mao: After I received the glorious title of wheat high-yield model and the national award, everyone in the village expressed their willingness to learn from me, and I felt supremely honored. I am determined to strive for a greater harvest and repay the People's Government for the award and you and the Communist Party for your cultivation with new production increase achievements.

    My wheat production increase plan for this year is: to guarantee that the average yield of wheat fields (dry land) in the whole group is 240 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared with last year; my three mu of high-yield wheat fields (also dry land) will produce 560 jin per mu, an increase of 58 jin compared with last year. Chairman Mao! This production increase target is very high, but we have the determination and confidence to achieve this goal. In order to prevent crops from suffering from drought, our whole group responded to the government's call to prevent drought and resist drought, dug a Western well, and also drove the whole village to dig 25 earth wells. We are no longer afraid of drought.

    Some time ago, we found a lot of aphids and red spiders in our wheat fields, and we immediately carried out extermination. We mobilized the masses of the whole village and used brooms, harrows, mats, and other things to eliminate aphids. In addition to using these local methods, the government also introduced several scientific aphid control methods to us. With the efforts of everyone and the help and leadership of the People's Government, these pests were quickly eliminated by us.

    Chairman Mao! Under your leadership, what disasters can we not overcome? No matter whether it is drought or insect pests, we, the liberated farmers, will subdue them one by one.

    In order to guarantee the realization of this year's production increase target, in addition to doing a good job in drought prevention and insect prevention, we must further improve farming technology, use new-style walking plows to plow the fields four times, harrow six times, drag six times, and hoe three times; apply five carts of base fertilizer per mu of wheat land, and topdress with bean cake and fertilizer powder. And pay attention to carefully selecting wheat seeds, to achieve ear selection, wind selection, and separate threshing and harvesting.

    We guarantee to promote our successfully tested wheat planting experience to the masses of the whole village and drive the farmers of the whole village to achieve high yields in every household.
    I wish you good health
    Jin Kedian, Wheat High-Yield Model in Yuxiang, Shanxi

    各地受奖的丰产模范
    写信给毛主席保证实现增产计划
    荣获“丰产村”光荣称号的阎家村人民保证每亩田增产一成半
    敬爱的毛主席：我们看到中央农业部颁布的奖励一九五一年农业爱国丰产模范的名单后，高兴的都跳起来了。我们向你祝贺，向丰产的各位劳动模范祝贺，同时向我们自己祝贺，因为我们全村获得了全国“丰产村”的光荣称号。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们知道，我们所以能得到这样光荣的称号，有几个原因：
    第一、我们有了你的正确的领导。一九四九年，我村实行了土地改革，打垮了封建势力。五十六户没有土地的和土地很少的贫苦农民，都分到了土地，生产积极性大大提高了。我们的村子在解放前是最穷苦的。那时，全村耕地只有六百多亩，十一头牲口，有两头还不能用。现在全村土地增加到九百一十七亩，牲口增加到五十二头，水地棉田产量从解放前的二百四十斤提高到四百三十三斤，旱地棉田的产量从四十五斤提高到一百五十六斤。全村农民生活一天比一天改善。以前每年吃糠咽菜的徐自来、史天成、阎来法等五户，现在每年有三分之二的日子吃的是白面；以前给地主扛长活的十二个农民，现在都在自己的土地上劳动，并有了牲口和农具，光景过得挺美。全村七十多户贫农已上升成中农。
    第二、党和政府奖励劳动互助的政策，有力地鼓舞了我们。全村在劳动模范史采桂、邵双合的领导下，组织了八个劳动互助组，百分之三十以上的农民，实行了集体劳动。这样就能够实行精耕细作了。我们得到了政府的各种贷款扶助，大家都有了底垫，给丰产打下了有利的基础。
    第三、工人老大哥的支援。去年天旱时，工人老大哥给我们造出了大量的新式水车、农具和各种药剂，供给我们使用。全村共买回新式水车三十四辆，以前用的手搬辘轳井，都安上新式水车，充分发挥了水的效能，同时又省下人力，在棉田中加工。往年棉田用人力浇，每天只能浇一亩半，去年用新式水车浇水，每天能浇三亩；往年棉田浇两遍，去年棉田浇了六遍。于是战胜了旱灾，保证了棉田的丰产。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们虽然得到“丰产村”的称号，但是，我们并不因此而满足。现在我们全行政村已组织起四十四个劳动互助组，并开始试办农业生产合作社。我们响应你和人民政府的号召，组织起来，防旱抗旱。现在我们已打成土井八十四眼，可保证四百亩田及时播种，可把二百亩旱地变为水地。全村今年的增产目标是每亩比去年增加一成半。全村今年水地棉田共有三百九十多亩，计划每亩平均从去年的四百三十三斤增产到四百九十八斤；旱地棉田共有四百五十亩，计划每亩平均从去年的一百五十六斤多增产到一百八十斤。总计今年全村水旱棉田共八百四十多亩，计划产籽棉二十七万五千五百多斤，比去年增产三万六千一百多斤。毛主席：请你放心，我们决不自满，我们全村群众有信心在一九五二年的生产战线上取得更大的胜利，响应你的号召：“增加生产、厉行节约、以支持中国人民志愿军”，并保持我们的爱国丰产模范村的光荣称号。最后，我们全村全体干部和群众向你致以崇高的革命敬礼
    山西省解县第一区阎家村全体干部和群众
    丰产模范小组廖仁福互助组保证每亩丰产田产谷一千三百斤
    亲爱的毛主席：看到人民日报登载的中央农业部颁发爱国丰产模范奖金的消息，知道我们——廖仁福互助小组光荣地得了奖。我们万分高兴。我们感谢您和伟大的中国共产党的英明领导。
    我们要永远保持这个光荣。我们向您提出保证：今年一定要实现每亩田产谷千斤的计划，并且选出三亩田作丰收示范，每亩产谷一千三百斤。廖仁福互助小组全体组员
    平顺县川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社保证每亩丰产玉茭收获一千一百斤
    敬爱的毛主席：我们听到中央人民政府农业部公布第一批全国农业丰产模范受奖名单和我社得奖金二百万元的消息后，感到无限光荣。这是我们在党和人民政府正确的领导下，组织起来，提高技术以后获得的成绩。我们要把奖金二百万元，再买玉米脱粒机一个，手摇磨面机一个，羊四十只，以扩大再生产。我们的农业生产合作社已由十八户扩大到四十一户；我们兴修水利的结果，已能保证全社三百亩秋地全部保墒下种，我们计划使玉茭每亩平均生产六百斤，谷子每亩生产四百五十斤。我们要种十亩丰产玉茭，保证每亩生产一千一百斤。并修公共场棚三间，盖房五间，圈窑两孔。我们提出这些条件向全县、专区农业生产合作社挑战，开展一九五二年的爱国丰产竞赛运动。我们决心以实际行动，把农业生产合作社搞好，完成一九五二年丰产任务，支援中国人民志愿军，打击美帝国主义者使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。川底村丰产模范郭玉恩农业生产合作社全体社员
    小麦丰产模范晋克典保证三亩丰产麦田每亩增产五十八斤
    亲爱的毛主席：我得到了小麦丰产模范的光荣称号和国家的奖励以后，全村的人都表示要向我学习，我感到无上光荣。我下决心争取更大丰收，用新的增产成绩，报答人民政府对我的奖励，报答您和共产党对我的培养。
    今年我的小麦增产计划是：保证全组麦田（旱地）每亩产二百四十斤，比去年增产两成；我的三亩丰产麦田（也是旱地），每亩生产五百六十斤，比去年增产五十八斤。毛主席！这个增产目标是很高的，但是我们有决心、有信心达到这个目标。为了不使庄稼受旱，我们全组响应了政府防旱抗旱的号召，打了一眼洋井，并且还带动全村打了二十五眼土井，我们再不怕天旱了。
    前些日子，我们的麦田里发现了很多蚜虫和红蜘蛛，我们立即进行扑灭。我们动员了全村群众，用扫帚、耱、席子等东西消灭蚜虫。除了用这些土办法外，政府还给我们介绍了几种科学治蚜办法，在大家的努力和人民政府的帮助领导下，这些害虫很快的就被我们消灭掉了。
    毛主席！在您的领导下，有什么灾害我们不能战胜呢？不管它旱灾也好、虫灾也好，我们翻了身的农民，都一个一个的把它制服了。
    为了保证今年增产目标的实现，我们除了作好防旱、防虫工作外，还要进一步提高耕作技术，使用新式步犁，把田犁四遍，耙六遍，耱六遍，锄三遍；每亩麦地上底肥五大车，用豆饼、肥田粉上追肥。并且注意精选麦种，作到穗选、风选、另打另收。
    我们保证向全村群众推广我们试验成功的种麦经验，带动全村农民，作到家家丰产。祝您身体健康  山西虞乡小麦丰产模范  晋克典
