Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: U.S. President Truman announced in Washington on April 28th that the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan officially came into effect on April 28th. This illegal measure by the U.S. government means that, starting from April 28th, Japan has become a "legitimate" colony and military base of the United States. Under the guise of Japan declaring "independence," the United States continues its military occupation of Japan and intensifies its enslavement of the Japanese people.

The U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan is entirely a product of the U.S. government's unilateral actions, and it is completely illegal. This treaty wantonly violates international agreements on the Japanese issue, such as the January 1, 1942, United Nations Declaration, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan. The San Francisco conference, where this treaty was signed, was an illegal conference manipulated by the United States that betrayed international obligations. The U.S.-made peace treaty absurdly stipulates that only countries that sign and ratify this so-called peace treaty can enjoy the rights of an Allied power against Japan, thus illegally excluding the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and major Far Eastern countries such as India and Burma, which had arduously resisted Japanese imperialist aggression, from the ranks of Allied powers against Japan, and brazenly infringing upon the sacred rights of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. For example, on the territorial issue, the U.S.-made treaty attempts to obliterate the People's Republic of China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Nansha Islands, and Xisha Islands, and the Soviet Union's territorial sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its surrounding islands. On the issue of reparations, the U.S.-made treaty completely disregards the legitimate rights of countries that suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression and stipulates terms that are detrimental to the Japanese working people. The People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other major countries that fought against Japan were completely excluded from the preparation and drafting of this "treaty" by the United States and refused to sign and ratify this "treaty." The U.S.-made treaty has no binding force on these countries.

The U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan is not a "peace treaty" at all, but an aggressive treaty in preparation for war. Along with the entry into force of the "peace treaty," the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" will also come into effect on April 28th. The latter two are developments of the former, and the three of them together constitute the U.S. military occupation of Japan. The "peace treaty" has no provisions restricting Japan's armed forces or prohibiting the revival of militarism, but stipulates that Japan "should do its utmost to assist" the United States in its aggressive actions carried out under the guise of the United Nations, and recognizes Japan's right to participate in the aggressive bloc advocated by the United States - the so-called "collective security agreement." The "Security Treaty" affirms the United States' right to continue its military occupation of Japan after the "peace treaty" comes into effect; and the "Administrative Agreement" further stipulates in detail the specific conditions and privileges of the military occupation, and insidiously stipulates that "when hostile acts occur within the territory of Japan or there is an imminent threat of hostile acts, the Government of Japan and the United States Government must take necessary joint measures" (Article 24 of the "Administrative Agreement"). In this way, the United States has tightly bound Japan to the U.S. chariot. General Ridgway, commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, bluntly stated on April 18th: "According to the treaty, Japan will be an indispensable part of the anti-communist (should be read as: aggressive) circle in the Western Pacific."

The U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan is not an equal treaty restoring Japan's independence and sovereignty, but a enslaving treaty that completely turns Japan into a U.S. colony. First of all, the reality that U.S. occupation forces are stationed on Japanese territory ruthlessly punctures the pretense of Japan's "independence." A country with foreign occupation forces stationed on its territory cannot be independent and autonomous. The "Administrative Agreement" also stipulates that U.S. troops stationed in Japan enjoy unequal privileges such as extraterritoriality, tax exemption, free entry and exit from Japan, issuance of military scrip, and driver's licenses. Japan must also provide a huge sum of 155 million U.S. dollars annually to maintain the U.S. troops stationed there. The "treaty" not only allows the United States to continue to occupy the entire Japanese mainland, but even refuses to allow Japan to retain nominal sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands and other islands south of 29 degrees north latitude, which originally belonged to Japan, and proclaims itself the "trustee authority." Regarding political clauses, the "treaty" opens the door for the revival of militarist forces on the one hand, and does not mention guaranteeing the freedom and democratic rights of the Japanese people on the other. Recently, under the direction of the U.S. occupiers, the Yoshida reactionary government is formulating a series of fascist bills centered on the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," the purpose of which is to completely deprive the Japanese people of their democratic rights and ensure the smooth implementation of the aggressive and enslaving "treaty." The enslaving nature of the "treaty" is also reflected in the economic clauses, which do not guarantee the unrestricted development of Japan's peaceful industry and Japan's right to free trade with other countries; on the contrary, it stipulates that Japan give the United States "national treatment" and "most-favored-nation treatment" for a period of four years, so that U.S. monopoly capital can devour the Japanese economy unimpeded. The U.S. occupiers pretend that the U.S.-made peace treaty recognizes that the Japanese people enjoy "full sovereignty," but in reality, the "treaty" grants the United States unlimited hegemony to enslave the Japanese people.

When the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan was signed on September 8th last year, Shigeru Nanbara, the then president of the University of Tokyo, said with deep sorrow: "This day is a day when all Japanese people should wear mourning clothes." Now, the Japanese people will regard April 28th, the "date the treaty comes into effect," as a day of national humiliation, and they will fight with greater force to abolish the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan and strive for genuine independence.

The Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan. My Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai declared on September 18th last year that my Central People's Government considers the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan to be illegal, invalid, and therefore absolutely unacceptable.

### 悍然侵犯中苏印缅等国的神圣权利  美国宣布非法的对日“和约”生效  日本变为美国“合法的”殖民地和军事基地

    悍然侵犯中苏印缅等国的神圣权利
    美国宣布非法的对日“和约”生效
    日本变为美国“合法的”殖民地和军事基地
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国总统杜鲁门四月二十八日在华盛顿宣布：美制单独对日和约自四月二十八日起正式生效。美国政府这一非法的措施意味着：从四月二十八日开始，日本成为美国的“合法的”殖民地和军事基地。在日本宣告“独立”的掩盖下，美国继续对日本实行军事占领，并变本加厉地奴役日本人民。
    美制对日和约完全是美国政府一手包办下的产物，它完全是非法的。这个条约横暴地破坏了一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告和协定、以及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的决议等有关日本问题的国际协议。签订这一条约的旧金山会议，是一个在美国操纵下的背弃国际义务的非法会议。美制对日和约荒谬地规定惟有签署和批准这个所谓和约的国家才能享有作为对日作战盟国的权利，这样，就把中华人民共和国、苏联以及印度、缅甸等曾经艰苦抵抗日本帝国主义侵略的远东主要国家，非法地从对日作战的盟国之列排除出去，并悍然侵犯中苏等国的神圣权利。例如，在领土问题上，美制和约妄图抹煞中华人民共和国对于台湾、澎湖列岛、南威岛和西沙群岛的领土主权，和苏联对于千岛群岛与库页岛南部及其附近岛屿的领土主权。又如在赔偿问题上，美制和约完全无视曾遭日本帝国主义侵略荼毒的各国的正当权利，并规定了不利于日本劳动人民的条款。中华人民共和国、苏联等对日作战的主要国家，在美国的排斥下，完全没有参加这一“和约”的准备和拟制，并且拒绝签署与批准这个“和约”。美制和约对这些国家是丝毫没有约束力的。
    美制对日和约完全不是什么“和平条约”，而是准备战争的侵略性条约。随同“和约”的生效，美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”也将在四月二十八日同时生效。后两者是前者的发展，它们三位一体地构成了美国军事占领日本的罗网。“和约”丝毫没有关于限制日本武装力量和禁止军国主义复活的条款，却规定日本对美国假借联合国名义所进行的侵略行动“应尽力予以协助”，并承认日本有权参加美国所倡导的侵略集团——所谓“集体安全协定”。“安全条约”肯定了美国在“和约”生效后继续军事占领日本的权利；而“行政协定”又进一步详细地规定了军事占领的具体条件和特权，并且阴险地规定“在日本区域内发生敌对行为或受到敌对行为的急迫威胁时，日本国政府及合众国政府，必须采取必要的共同措施”（“行政协定”第二十四条）。这样，美国就把日本紧紧地缚上了美国的战车。驻日美国占领军司令李奇微在四月十八日露骨地说：“根据条约，日本将是西太平洋防共圈（应读作侵略圈）上不可少的一部分。”
    美制对日和约也不是恢复日本独立和主权的平等条约，而是彻底变日本为美国殖民地的奴役条约。首先，日本领土上驻有美国占领军这一现实情况就无情地戳破了日本“独立”的幌子。一个在本国领土上驻有外国占领军的国家，不可能是独立自主的。“行政协定”并且规定，驻日美军享有治外法权、免税、自由出入日本国境、发行军票和驾驶许可证等等不平等的特权，日本并且每年要提供一亿五千五百万美元的巨款，维持美国驻军。“和约”不但使美国继续占领整个日本本土，并且对于北纬二十九度以南的原属日本的琉球群岛等岛屿的领土主权，甚至不愿让日本在名义上加以保留，而自封美国为“托管当局”。关于政治条款，“和约”一方面为军国主义势力的复活开放了大门，另一方面根本没有提到保障日本人民的自由和民主权利。最近，在美国占领者的指使下，吉田反动政府正在制订以“防止破坏活动法案”为中心的一系列的法西斯法案，其目的就在于彻底剥夺日本人民的民主权利，保证侵略和奴役性质的“和约”能够顺利实施。“和约”的奴役性也表现在经济条款上，它没有保障日本和平工业的无限制发展和日本与其他国家自由贸易的权利；相反地，它却规定日本给美国以为期长达四年的“国民待遇”和“最惠国待遇”，使美国垄断资本能够通行无阻地吞噬日本经济。美国占领者佯言美制对日和约承认日本人民享有“充分主权”，实际上是“和约”赋予美国奴役日本人民的无限霸权。
    当美制对日和约在去年九月八日签字的时候，当时的东京大学校长南原繁曾经沉痛地说：“这一天是日本全体国民应该穿孝的日子。”现在，日本人民将以国耻日来看待四月二十八日的“和约生效日”，他们将激愤地以更大的力量为废除美制对日和约而斗争，为争取真正的独立而斗争。
    中国人民坚决反对美制对日和约。我周恩来外交部长已在去年九月十八日声明：我中央人民政府认为美制对日和约是非法的，无效的，因而是绝对不能承认的。
