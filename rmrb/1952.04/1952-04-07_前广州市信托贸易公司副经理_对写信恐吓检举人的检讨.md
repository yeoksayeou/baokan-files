    Former Deputy Manager of Guangzhou Trust and Trade Company
    Self-Criticism for Writing Letters to Intimidate Whistleblowers
    Comrade Editor: In mid-November of last year, Guangzhou citizen He Shan wrote a letter举报 [jiǔbào:to report wrongdoing] alleging that the Guangzhou Trust and Trade Company was suspected of colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal state assets. The truth of this case is now clear. At the time, I did not treat the whistleblower's report with the correct attitude. Instead, I wrote a letter to intimidate the whistleblower, thus committing a serious error. After the incident occurred, I downplayed my mistakes, shirked responsibility, refused to admit my errors, and did not seriously examine myself ideologically, which was even more wrong. After receiving the letter举报 [jiǔbào:to report wrongdoing], I believed that the individual facts举报 [jiǔbào:to report wrongdoing]ed by the whistleblower were inconsistent with the actual situation, and therefore I denied the basic facts举报 [jiǔbào:to report wrongdoing]ed by him, treated the whistleblower with an extremely bad attitude, and even wrote him a threatening letter.
    The ideological root cause of this error is that I have the privileged thinking of the exploiting class. Instead of treating the举报 [jiǔbào:to report wrongdoing] seriously and humbly as a servant of the people, I retaliated against the people from the position of a ruler. Such erroneous thinking is very dangerous if it is allowed to develop.
    Through the education and help of leading cadres and comrades, I have been able to face up to my mistakes and realize that this is a serious violation of policy and discipline and an act that damages the prestige of the People's Government. I should bear full responsibility for this case. Therefore, I fully accept the Supervisory Committee's decision to discipline me and guarantee that I will strengthen my study, work hard, and conscientiously transform and train myself in the future in order to thoroughly correct my mistakes.

    前广州市信托贸易公司副经理
    对写信恐吓检举人的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十一月中旬，广州市民何善写信检举广州市信托贸易公司有和奸商互相串通盗窃国家资财的嫌疑。此案真相现在已经大白。我当时没有用正确的态度对待检举人的检举，反而写信恐吓检举者，因此犯了严重的错误。在事件发生后，我又避重就轻，推卸责任，不承认错误，没有认真从思想上去深刻检查自己，这更是错误的。我接到检举信以后，认为检举者所检举的个别事实与实际情况有出入，因而就否定了他检举的基本事实，用极端恶劣的态度来对待检举者，甚至向他写了恐吓信。
    产生这种错误的思想根源，是由于我有着剥削阶级的特权思想。我不是以一个人民的勤务员来认真和虚心地对待检举，反而以统治者的姿态骑在人民头上进行报复。这种错误思想如任其发展下去，是非常危险的。
    经过领导干部和同志们的教育、帮助，使我能够正视自己的错误，使我认识到这是严重的违反政策，违反纪律和损害人民政府威信的行为。我应对这一案件负完全责任。因此，我完全接受监察委员会对我的处分决定，并保证今后加强学习，努力工作，认真改造和锻炼自己，以彻底纠正我的错误。
