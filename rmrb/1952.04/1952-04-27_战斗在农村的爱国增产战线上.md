    Fighting on the Patriotic Production Increase Front in Rural Areas
    Since the beginning of spring, there has been little rain in eastern Sichuan, which has greatly affected the harvest of the minor spring crops and spring plowing production. In order to mobilize the people of the entire region to overcome the drought and complete this year's patriotic production increase tasks in agriculture, the leading organs of the Party, government, and military in eastern Sichuan jointly issued instructions in early April, calling on cadres of Party, government, and military organs and mass organizations at all levels throughout the region to immediately organize a 500,000-strong drought prevention army to help farmers overcome the drought in their spare time. At this time, the comrades of the Southwest Sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers Returning Delegation and the Southwest Sub-delegation of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China came to Beibei, the seat of the eastern Sichuan Administrative Office. They participated in this movement with unparalleled enthusiasm and personally helped the farmers carry water to irrigate the fields.
    The scene on April 6 is one that the people of eastern Sichuan will never forget.
    Early in the morning, the anti-drought army of more than 5,000 people composed of various organs, schools, and factories in Beibei, led by Yan Hongyan, director of the eastern Sichuan Administrative Office, Wei Siwen, deputy secretary of the CPC eastern Sichuan District Committee, and Zhong Hanhua, director of the Political Department of the eastern Sichuan Military Region, set off in different directions to 18 villages in five townships including Jin’gang Township in the suburbs (top picture). When the six representatives headed by Pei Guang, leader of the Southwest Sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers Returning Delegation, and the three representatives headed by Zhu Zhenjing, leader of the Southwest Sub-delegation of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China, arrived (middle picture), cheers and applause resounded throughout the mountains and fields. The song "The Chinese and Korean people are as close as brothers, fighting side by side to strike the enemy..." resounded through the clouds.
    The teams dispersed. Many long lines stretched from the river ditches all the way to the hillsides, with buckets full of water being transported one after another. The thirsty broad beans and the corn waiting to be rescued all stretched their necks and drank their fill.
    The volunteer representatives and Korean friends worked like they were participating in a battle. Zhang Boying, the female representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, took off her shoes and socks and jumped into the weir to fetch water. Hyun Ho-beom, the representative of the Korean People's Army, carried a large bucket of manure on his shoulders and went back and forth to the small river ditch to fetch water (bottom picture). Throughout the morning, the representatives watered slope after slope, sweating profusely, without resting.
    The owners of the crops—the liberated farmers of the 18 villages, old and young, men and women—were all filled with joy. Carrying water and buckets, they worked even harder. They said: "It is something that has never happened in thousands of years to have so many people working for us. We must organize ourselves to overcome the drought." Old women and young children also came. They brought boiled water and insisted on dragging the representatives to rest. Zhang Lirong, an 18-year-old Youth League member and the well-known female model mutual aid team leader in eastern Sichuan, warmly shook the hand of Comrade Zhao Chunxiao, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, where they exchanged greetings and encouragement: "Thank you, hardworking model!"
    "Thank you, brave heroes!"
    "We will definitely kill more American devils on the Korean front."
    "We will definitely increase grain production in the motherland in large quantities."
    The story of the volunteer representatives and Korean friends carrying water quickly spread throughout eastern Sichuan. It encouraged the strong will of the people of the entire region to overcome the drought. Now, the anti-drought army of 500,000 cadres in eastern Sichuan is continuing to fight heroically against the drought together with 5 million farmers. It is estimated that the labor achievements of the organ cadres alone can increase grain production by one million catties.

    战斗在农村的爱国增产战线上
    入春以来，川东各地很少下雨，小春收成和春耕生产受到很大影响。川东区党、政、军领导机关为了发动全区人民战胜旱灾，完成今年农业方面的爱国增产任务，在四月初联合发出指示，号召全区各级党、政、军机关和群众团体的干部，马上组织五十万人的防旱大军，利用空余时间，帮助农民战胜旱灾。正在这时，志愿军归国代表团西南分团和朝鲜人民访华代表团西南分团的同志们，来到川东行署所在地——北碚。他们以无比的热情参加了这一运动，亲自动手帮助农民担水灌田。
    四月六日这一天的情景，是川东人民永远不会忘记的。
    一大早，北碚各机关、学校、工厂所组成的五千多人的抗旱大军，人人挑着水桶、拿着面盆，在川东行署主任阎红彦、中共川东区党委副书记魏思文、川东军区政治部主任钟汉华等率领下，分途向郊区金刚乡等五乡十八个村进发（上图）。当志愿军归国代表团西南分团裴光团长为首的六位代表和朝鲜人民访华代表团西南分团朱镇璟团长为首的三位代表来到时（中图），欢呼声、鼓掌声响彻了整个山野。“中朝人民亲如兄弟，并肩作战打击敌人……”的歌声响彻云霄。
    队伍散开了。许多长长的行列从河沟一直排到山坡上，盛满水的木桶一个接一个地输送着。饥渴的蚕豆，待救的苞谷，都伸着他们的脖子，喝饱了水。
    志愿军代表和朝鲜友人，像参加战斗一样地工作着。志愿军女代表张伯英把鞋子、袜子都脱了，跳下堰塘去取水。朝鲜人民军代表玄虎范挑着一担很大的粪桶，来回不停地到小河沟去取水（下图）。整个上午，代表们浇了一坡又一坡，个个满身大汗，还不休息。
    庄稼的主人——十八个村翻了身的农民们，老的少的，男的女的，人人洋溢着喜悦。他们担着水、提着桶，劳动的劲头更大了。他们说：“这样多的人为我们做事，是几千年来没有的事。我们一定要组织起来，战胜旱灾。”老大娘们和小娃娃们也来了。她们提着烧好的开水，硬拖着代表们休息。十八岁的青年团团员、闻名川东的女模范互助组组长张莉蓉，热情地紧握着志愿军代表赵春晓同志的手，在那里互相慰问和鼓励：“谢谢你们，勤劳的模范！”
    “谢谢你们，勇敢的英雄！”
    “我们一定在朝鲜前线多杀美国鬼子。”
    “我们一定在祖国大量增产粮食。”
    志愿军代表和朝鲜友人挑水的故事，很快地就传遍了川东各地。它鼓舞了全区人民战胜旱灾的坚强意志。现在，川东各地五十万干部组成的抗旱大军，正和五百万农民一道，继续和旱灾进行英勇的斗争。估计光机关干部的劳动成果，就可增产一百万斤粮食。
