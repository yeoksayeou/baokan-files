    A Brother's Help Needs No Thanks
    —With Đoàn trưởng Hong Sun-cheol: "Please Accept the Glory Bestowed Upon You"
    Wang Yiyu, Teacher at Wenxi Middle School, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province After reading the new poem, I wanted to write a poem, but not because I wanted to be a poet—only because the words in the poem stirred my heart, only because the writer of the new poem is a dear Korean friend. You said—
    "Everything I have seen and heard,
    Besides gratitude, I can't say a second word." I say—a brother's help needs no thanks! Our five-star red flag also bears your blood, and the head of Changbai Mountain is buried with the white bones of Korean heroes. In our difficult years in China, you fought alongside us! Korea and China are only separated by a river. People in Jiangnan can see people in Jiangbei doing laundry. Countries with the same destiny, people with the same destiny, how can we not think of each other for a moment? Brothers fighting against the last devil of mankind, you are waging the most just war! You are writing the most magnificent poem in world history! Many factories were destroyed by the invaders, but you built more machine guns and cannons in the caves. Many villages were razed to the ground by the invaders, but you planted more crops under the enemy's bombing. Countless mothers and children were killed, but your youth flooded the front lines like a tide. Final victory lies in the brilliant tomorrow! Chairman Mao calls on us to increase production and practice thrift, all for the sake of supporting the Korean people's just war. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns reverberate like thunder across China, and China will move forward faster because of these struggles! Countless young people dream of enlisting in the army, countless teenagers are planning day and night how to help Korean brothers rebuild their homes in the future, and countless women are rushing to make military shoes in the middle of the night, preparing summer comfort fans in winter! Let us shake hands hard, let us embrace and embrace again, let the people of Mao Zedong and Kim Il-sung unite into a giant, let our hearts jump forever in your hearts!

    兄弟的帮助用不着感谢
    ——和洪淳哲团长：“请接受献给你们的光荣”
    浙江江山县文溪中学教员  汪逸羽读罢新诗想写诗，但决不是想做诗人——只因诗里的言语激动了我的心，只因写新诗的是一个亲爱的朝鲜友人。你说——
    “我所见到的和听到的一切，
    除了感激我再也说不出第二句话。”我说——兄弟的帮助用不着感谢！我们的五星红旗上也有着你们的鲜血，长白山头埋有朝鲜英雄的白骨。在我们中国多难的年月，你们曾和我们一道作战！朝鲜和中国只隔一条江，江南的人看得见江北的人洗衣裳，同一命运的国家，同一命运的人民，那能一刻不想念？和人类的最后一个魔鬼厮杀的兄弟，你们在进行着最正义的战争！你们在写着世界历史上最壮烈的诗篇！许多工厂被强盗们毁坏了，你们在山洞里造出了更多的机枪大炮，许多村庄被强盗们夷平了，你们在敌机狂炸下种了更多的庄稼，无数母亲和孩子被杀死了，你们的青年却潮水一样涌上了前线。最后的胜利就在灿烂的明天！毛主席号召我们增加生产，厉行节约，为的就是支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。“三反”“五反”像轰雷响遍中国，中国将因这些斗争而更快地向前！无数的青年梦里也在报名参军，无数的少年在昼夜计划着将来怎样帮助朝鲜兄弟重建家园，无数的妇女在半夜三更赶做军鞋，冬天已在预备着夏天的慰劳扇！让我们用力用力地握手，让我们拥抱再拥抱，让毛泽东和金日成的人民团结成一个巨人，让我们的心能在你们的心里永远跳跃！
