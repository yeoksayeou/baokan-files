Unite with the powerful worldwide movement in defense of peace to strive for the immediate prohibition of atomic weapons, the prohibition of germ warfare, the implementation of disarmament, and the conclusion of a five-power peace pact!

The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party emphasized the fraternal friendship of the German people with the people of the Soviet Union, China, Poland, and other people's democratic countries that are victoriously advancing along the socialist road. The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party said: The Central Committee calls on German patriots to do their utmost to fight for the signing of a German peace treaty, for the restoration of a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany!

Workers and employees in West Germany and West Berlin, organize mass strikes against the militarist "General Treaty" and the revival of West German militarism! Consolidate the united action of Social Democrats and Communists in the struggle for the signing of a peace treaty, against West German remilitarization, and against poverty and fascist terror! Workers, peasants, and intellectuals of West Germany, unite and act decisively! Conduct demonstrations against the militarist "General Treaty" and in support of the peace treaty! Strive for an immediate agreement on conducting free all-German elections to establish an all-German government!
