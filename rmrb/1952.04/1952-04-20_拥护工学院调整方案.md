As Dean of the Engineering College of Peking University, I would like to express my support for the proposed adjustment plan for engineering colleges.

The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a national conference of engineering college presidents in November 1951, during which the national plan for adjusting departments and colleges within engineering institutes was drafted. This plan has been approved by the Government Administration Council and was announced on April 16th of this year. This is the best news for higher industrial education nationwide, the beginning of a thorough reform of higher education in the country, and an important step for national higher education to unreservedly serve the needs of the motherland and cultivate senior construction talents for the motherland. This is worth the enthusiastic support of all comrades engaged in higher education and the cheers of the people nationwide.

The higher education left to us by old China was a product of semi-feudal and semi-colonial society and is not suitable for the needs of the people of new China. However, because the teachers' thinking has not been well reformed, the thorough reform of national higher education has been subjected to various obstacles. In the "Three-Anti" movement, after ideological examination, we realized that although it has been three years since liberation, decadent bourgeois ideology, serious corruption, waste, and bureaucracy still exist in universities. We have not only failed to train cadres in accordance with the needs of national construction, but on the contrary, we are still educating young people with the old ways, changing the soup but not the medicine, and constantly spreading various ideological poisons to them, poisoning the youth and causing irreparable losses to the cause of national construction. The fact that this adjustment plan for engineering colleges has been unanimously supported by the national conference of engineering college presidents shows that teachers' understanding in universities has been greatly improved, and it also shows that everyone can consider issues from the needs of national construction and based on the actual economic situation of the country. This is a major gain in ideological reform and study, and a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

My attitude towards the issue of adjusting departments and colleges in the past three years should be examined. In the early days of liberation, I was very unwilling to hear about the adjustment of departments and colleges, mainly because I was afraid that the Engineering College of Peking University would move. At that time, I heard that the Northeast and other places were heavy industrial areas and needed engineering colleges very much, so I was afraid that the government would decide to move the Engineering College of Peking University there. I myself was unwilling to be "exiled" to the Northeast and other places, and I thought the professors would also be unwilling to go, so I "explained" to some comrades: "The government will definitely not want us to move, because it knows it won't work." I also created "theories" saying, "There is no need for an engineering college to be located in an industrial area, because an engineering college cannot be run well if it is separated from other colleges and cannot be linked." At that time, I did not recognize that education should serve the people. I only regarded running education as a matter of satisfying my own interests and showing my own abilities.

After the higher education conference in the summer vacation of 1950, I agreed to the adjustment of departments and colleges. At that time, the issue of moving to the Northeast and other places no longer existed. However, the main reason I agreed to the adjustment of departments and colleges was that I was very envious of the development of new-type universities and felt that if the old-type universities could be transformed into new-type universities through adjustment, they would be greatly developed. In particular, seeing that the national aviation departments received a lot of funding after the adjustment, I was even more envious. Therefore, I once talked about the key development of various departments in the spring of 1951, and also talked about the overall merger of Peking University and Tsinghua University, and also talked about a large expansion of departments and specialties. These were all in order to take advantage of loopholes, make a big profit, and build up my own assets. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the Engineering College of Peking University discovered extremely serious stockpiling and waste. The tricks I had thought of to "adjust departments and colleges" were of course impossible to succeed. If they had succeeded, the figures for stockpiling and waste would have been even greater.

Although I expressed my support for adjusting departments and colleges for selfish reasons, I was the first to oppose the principle of independent industrial universities when it was proposed at the higher education conference in 1950. I myself came from the science department and had many connections with the science department, so I felt that the relationship between science and engineering colleges was close and should not be separated. Therefore, I opposed industrial universities and supported polytechnic universities. At that time, I said that good mathematics and physics teachers could not be found in independent industrial universities, and the basic training of students would suffer serious losses. I also cited some independent engineering colleges as examples to prove my point. At that time, I thought that good mathematics and physics teachers must have their own department and be able to train their own students in order to feel that they have a future. In independent industrial universities, they are teaching other people's students and are limited to shallow basic courses. How can they be interested? It was not until I carefully examined my own thinking in the "Three-Anti" movement that I discovered the error of my thinking. My thinking was a manifestation of selfish individualism. Industrial education is the focus of higher education and a powerful pillar of national construction. Why should outstanding teachers with a high level of awareness emphasize their own interests and be unwilling to work in the positions most needed by the motherland? They are all cultivating construction talents for the motherland. What is meant by one's own students? Now that I think about it, these are all very absurd statements. I regarded everyone else as extreme individualists like myself. At that time, because the ideological situation of ordinary teachers was very similar to mine, not only did no one point out my absurdity, but some people sympathized with me, which hindered the work of adjusting departments and colleges. My idea of a polytechnic university was also completely wrong. The relationship between science and engineering colleges is close, but there is no need for them to be together. Because of the needs of national construction, the industrial sector needs to recruit a large number of students, while the science sector needs relatively few. If schools with engineering departments and specialties also have science departments, the latter will be very large in number, but the number of students in each department will be very small, which is very uneconomical. What industrial universities need is a sound mathematics and physics teaching research and guidance group. There is no need to waste manpower excessively by setting up many departments. This is a very simple principle, but I could not understand it for a long time, mainly because I considered the adjustment of departments and colleges entirely from a personal and parochial perspective, without considering the needs of the people, thus hindering this important work. This is a reflection of bourgeois ideology. It is because of the bourgeois ideology of our university teachers that the higher education of the motherland has not been thoroughly reformed three years after liberation. According to the plan in the adjustment plan for engineering colleges, after the initial adjustment in 1952, the number of students enrolled in engineering colleges nationwide can be 97 percent (14,500 people) more than before the adjustment. This shows how much loss the country has suffered because the adjustment was three years late! Is it tolerable that we treat our sacred task of cultivating senior construction cadres in this way? My performance at the national higher education conference and my proposals in the school seriously hindered the work of adjusting departments and colleges. In the reform of higher education, I have let the people down.

The adjustment plan for engineering colleges has been widely supported, but this is only the first step in the reform of higher education. How to implement this plan, complete this adjustment work, complete the enrollment plan, run the specialist courses well, and further streamline the curriculum, reform the teaching content and teaching methods, and ensure in quality and quantity that we cultivate outstanding cadres with both ability and integrity, a healthy physique, and a high level of communist consciousness for large-scale construction in the motherland - these serious tasks are still waiting for us to complete. After the "Three-Anti" movement, university teachers, whose thinking has made great progress, have the confidence to complete this task. Of course, the work is arduous. Only by constantly improving our awareness, continuing to carry forward the spirit of the "Three-Anti" movement, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and fully exerting the collective strength, can we overcome all difficulties and successfully complete our tasks. I am determined to continue to earnestly step up my study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform my thinking, and strive to contribute all my strength to the great and glorious task and strive for our bright and beautiful future.

    拥护工学院调整方案
    北京大学工学院院长  马大猷
    中央人民政府教育部在一九五一年十一月召开了全国工学院院长会议，在会议上拟定了全国工学院院系调整方案，这个方案已经由政务院批准，并已在本年四月十六日公布了。这对于全国的高等工业教育是一个最大的喜讯，是全国高等教育彻底改革的开始，也是全国高等教育无保留地服从祖国需要、为祖国培养高级建设人材的重要步骤。这是值得所有从事高等教育工作的同志们热烈拥护的，也是值得全国人民欢呼的。
    旧中国遗留给我们的高等教育是半封建半殖民地社会的产物，是不适合于新中国人民的需要的。但是因为教师们的思想没有很好的改造，就使全国高等教育的彻底改革受到了种种阻碍。在“三反”运动中，经过思想检查，我们认识到：解放虽然已有三年，但高等学校里仍然严重地存在着资产阶级的腐朽思想，存在着严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，我们不但没有按照祖国建设的需要培养干部，相反地我们还是用老一套办法换汤不换药地教育青年并且不断地向他们散布着各式各样的思想毒素，毒害着青年，使祖国建设事业遭受了不可补偿的损失。这次工学院调整方案能得到全国工学院院长会议一致拥护，说明高等学校教师的认识已有极大的提高，也说明大家已能从祖国建设需要考虑问题，能根据祖国实际经济情况考虑问题，这是思想改造学习的一个重大收获，也是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我在过去三年中对院系调整问题的态度是应该检讨的。在解放初期，我很不愿意听院系调整的说法，这主要是怕北京大学工学院搬家。那时听说东北等地是重工业区，很需要工学院，我就怕政府决定把北京大学工学院搬去。我自己不愿意“充军”到东北等地去，我想教授们也是不愿意去的，所以我就向有些同志们“解释”说：“政府一定不会要我们搬家的，因为它知道办不通。”我并且制造“理论”说：“工学院没有必要设在工业区，因为工学院和其他学院分开不能联系就办不好了。”我在那时是不认识教育应该为人民服务的，我只是把办教育当做满足自己兴趣、施展自己本领的事情。
    一九五零年暑假开过高等教育会议后，我就赞成院系调整了。那时搬到东北等地的问题是已经不存在了。但是我赞成院系调整的主要原因是看着新型大学的发展很眼热，觉得如果经过调整，旧型大学可以摇身一变就成为新型大学，它将大大地得到发展。尤其是看到全国航空系调整后得到很多经费，我更是羡慕了。因此，曾在一九五一年春天谈过各系重点发展，也谈过北京大学和清华大学全面合并，又谈过大量扩充科系。这些都是为了钻空子，大捞一笔，搞起自己的家当。在“三反”运动中，北京大学工学院发现极严重的积压浪费现象。我所想到的那些“调整院系”的花样当然是不可能成功的，如果成功，积压浪费的数字还要更大得多。
    我虽然由于自私原因表示赞成调整院系，但是在一九五零年高等教育会议中提出独立的工业大学的原则时，我是第一个反对的。我自己出身于理学院，和理学院有很多联系，我就觉得理、工学院关系密切，不应分开，所以我反对工业大学而赞成理工大学。我那时说在独立的工业大学内请不到好的数学物理教员，同学的基本训练要受到严重损失。我并且拿一些独立工学院为例，证明我的说法。我当时想，好的数学物理教员必须有个自己的系，能培养自己的学生，他们才觉得有前途。在独立的工业大学里教的都是别人的学生，又限于浅近的基本课程，他们如何能有兴趣？一直到“三反”运动中仔细检查自己的思想，我才发现我这种想法的错误。我这种想法是自私自利的个人主义的表现。工业教育是高等教育的重点，是祖国建设的有力支柱，具有高度觉悟水平的优秀教师为什么强调自己兴趣而不愿意到祖国最需要的岗位上来工作呢？都是为祖国培养建设人才，又什么叫做自己的学生呢？现在想来这都是非常荒谬的说法，我把别人都看成和我一样的极端个人主义者。当时因一般教师的思想情况和我很相近，不但没有人指出我的荒谬，反倒有人对我同情，使院系调整工作受到阻碍。我的理工大学的说法也是完全错误的。理、工学院关系是密切的，但是没有必要在一起。因为祖国建设的需要，工业方面是要招收大量学生的，而理科需要就比较少。如果有工学院系科的学校都有理学院的系，后者数量就要非常大，而每一个系的学生人数却很少，办起来是非常不经济的。工业大学所需要的就是健全的数学和物理教学研究指导组，不应该过分浪费人力多设很多系。这是非常简单的道理，可是我却在很长时间里搞不通，主要是因为我考虑院系调整完全是从个人出发，从本位出发，没有考虑到人民的需要，因此阻挠了这个重要的工作。这是资产阶级思想的反映。就是因为我们高等学校教师们的资产阶级思想在作祟，使祖国的高等教育在解放后三年还没有彻底改革。按照工学院调整方案中的计划，一九五二年经初步调整后，全国工学院招生名额可以比调整以前多百分之九十七（一万四千五百人），这就可以看出调整晚了三年，使祖国遭受了多么重大的损失！我们这样对待我们培养高级建设干部的神圣任务，这难道是可以容忍的吗？我在全国高等教育会议上的表现，在学校中的主张都严重地妨碍了院系调整工作，在高等教育的改革中，我是对不起人民的。
    工学院调整方案受到普遍的拥护，但这只是高等教育改革工作的第一步。如何贯彻这个方案的实施，完成这个调整工作，完成招生计划，办好专修科，并进一步精简课程，改革教学内容和教学方法，在质和量上保证为祖国培养大规模建设所需的才德兼备、体魄健全、具有高度共产主义觉悟水平的优秀干部——这些严肃的任务都还在等待着我们去完成。经过“三反”运动，思想已有极大进步的高等学校教师们是有信心完成这个任务的。固然，工作是艰巨的，只有不断地提高我们的觉悟，继续发扬“三反”运动中的精神，开展批评和自我批评，充分地发挥集体力量，才有可能克服一切困难，胜利地完成我们的任务。我决心继续切实地加紧学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，彻底改造我的思想，并争取在伟大光荣的任务中贡献我的一切力量，为我们的光明美好的未来而奋斗。
