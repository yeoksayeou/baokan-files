    Leading Cadres in Certain Counties and Districts of Shandong
    Seriously Suppress Public Criticism and Must Conduct Self-Criticism
    Comrade Editor: Since the CCP Central Committee issued the decision on carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications and the Government Administration Council announced the decision on handling people's letters and reception work, some leading cadres in counties and districts of Shandong Province continue to adopt an attitude of ignoring or attacking the people's letters and criticisms, which is very wrong.
    Last September, Wang Gedi, a peasant correspondent from Dongluzhuang Village, Second District, Wenshang County, wrote a letter reflecting the fact that cadres of the Zhangwu Township Cooperative in Wenshang County were using public funds for private merchants' speculation and profiteering, and using large scales to buy and small scales to sell. After receiving the letter, this group forwarded it to the Wenshang County United Cooperative, asking them to investigate and deal with it. After Zhang Xianying, the head of the district, learned about this matter, he not only did not check the problems of the cooperative, but instead summoned Wang Gedi, the letter writer, to the district and asked him to reflect on and examine the starting point of his writing, saying that Wang Gedi was "arrogant," "overstepping the organization," and "unstable in his position," etc., forcing him to admit his mistakes, leaving Wang Gedi hungry in the district government for a day. After we investigated and verified this matter, we launched a criticism in this newspaper. More than 160 people successively wrote letters expressing their opinions, demanding that the leading organs of Wenshang County seriously handle this issue. As a result, only the county government, the head of the propaganda department of the county committee, and Zhang Xianying himself made extremely superficial self-criticisms, and the matter ended without resolution.
    For example, in July last year, some people in Dongshahe Village, Fifth District, Huantai County, jointly wrote a letter accusing their township head and party branch secretary of corruption and illegal activities. This newspaper forwarded the letter to the Huantai County Government for investigation and handling. Eight months have passed, and we have urged them five times, but the Huantai County Government has neither handled it nor written back. On March 1st this year, we received a letter from Li Baoji of Zhouwangzhuang Village, Fourth District, Changqing County, Shandong Province, reporting that village cadre Li Baolin had embezzled more than 6,000 jin of grain. After Fang Ziheng, the head of the Fourth District of Changqing, received our investigation letter, he illegally summoned Li Baorong, the militia instructor who reported the situation (Li Baoji wrote the letter based on his report), to the district government and detained him for five days, ordering him to "reflect on his mistakes." Finally, Li Baorong's position as instructor was revoked. District cadres also said that Li Baolin's embezzlement was nothing. The letter writer, Li Baoji, was extremely dissatisfied with this.
    The serious suppression of criticism by leading cadres, as well as the bureaucratic attitude towards people's letters, is not a problem of individual local cadres in Shandong Province. I suggest that the relevant organs conduct a thorough inspection of the implementation of the CCP Central Committee's decision on carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications and the Government Administration Council's decision on handling people's letters and reception work in various places, and make necessary regulations to make the relationship between the people and the Party and the People's Government closer.

### 山东某些县区领导干部  严重压制群众批评必须检讨

    山东某些县区领导干部
    严重压制群众批评必须检讨
    编辑同志：自中共中央发布了关于在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的决定和政务院公布了关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定后，山东省某些县区领导干部对人民来信工作以及人民的批评，继续采取置之不理或打击的态度，这是非常错误的。
    去年九月，汶上县二区东芦庄农民通讯员王革底来信，反映汶上县张吾乡合作社干部借公款给私商投机倒把，和大秤买小秤卖等违法乱纪的事实，本组即将来信转至汶上县联社，请他们调查处理。该区区长张仙瀛知道此事后，不但不检查合作社的问题，反把来信人王革底叫到区里，要他反省、检讨写稿的出发点，并说王革底“自高自大”“超越组织”“立场不稳”等，强迫他承认错误，使王革底在区政府饿了一天。这事经我们调查证实后，就在本报上开展了批评。先后有一百六十多人来信发表了意见，要求汶上县领导机关认真处理这个问题。结果，仅县政府、县委员会宣传部长和张仙瀛自己作了极不深刻的检讨，此事便不了了之。
    再如去年七月间，桓台县五区东沙河村部分群众曾联名来信控告他们的乡长、党总支书记有贪污违法行为。本报把信转给桓台县府调查处理。至今已八个月，我们先后催过五次，桓台县府既不处理，也不来信。今年三月一日，我们接到山东省长清县四区周王庄村李宝玑检举村干部李宝林贪污六千多斤粮食的来信。长清四区房子恒区长接到我们的调查信后，竟把反映意见的民兵指导员李宝瑢（李宝玑是根据他反映写的信）非法传至区政府扣押五天，令其“反省错误”。最后撤销了李宝瑢的指导员职务。区干部还说李宝林贪污这点算不了什么。写信人李宝玑对此极为不满。
    领导干部严重地压制批评，以及对人民来信采取官僚主义的态度，在山东省来说，并非是个别地方干部的问题。我建议有关机关对于各地执行中共中央关于在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的决定以及政务院关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作决定的情形，来一次彻底的检查，作出必要的规定，使人民群众和党和人民政府的关系更加密切起来。
