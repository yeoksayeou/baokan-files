Summary of Letters

    Eliminating Idealistic Views in Genetics
    Editor: Eliminating the influence of the reactionary idealistic Mendel-Morgan theory in the field of genetics is one of the urgent tasks of the genetics community. However, I recently read a book compiled by Mou Hongyi called "Marriage Medicine" (Shanghai Beixin Bookstore, third edition in July 1951). The editor devoted fifty pages to blindly promoting the Mendel-Morgan theory, wrongly believing that Mendel "invented the true laws of heredity," and that "crime is...still more due to congenital heredity than to environmental factors." Such unscientific statements are intolerable. I hope the editor of this book will pay attention to correcting this.

    Errors in the book "The Cooperative Cause of New China"
    Editor: Some errors in the book "The Cooperative Cause of New China" (written by Zhang Yiguang and Zhang Puan, second edition by Tangdi Publishing House, October 1951) should be corrected. For example, in the third chapter, "Content of Special Cooperatives," the author says: "Currently, only one type of cooperative depot belongs to this category." In fact, cooperative depots are only trust business institutions of various levels of federations and should not be called special cooperatives. Also, in the eighth chapter, "Development of Soviet Cooperatives," the author says: "In 1928, the government began to value cooperatives and support the development of the cooperative economy." This is completely inconsistent with the facts. As early as 1919, Lenin said: "We have been working hard to manage the affairs of cooperatives since April 1918" ("Selected Works of Lenin," Moscow Chinese Edition, Volume II, page 535). The authors wrote a book without clarifying many facts, which shows that the authors are not serious about their writing. There are many other errors in this book, and the authors should quickly correct them.

    The Xi'an Masses Daily Should Strengthen its Work in Contacting the Masses
    Editor: The Xi'an Masses Daily has serious shortcomings in its mass work. These shortcomings have had a very bad impact on our troops. To give an example: in one year and two months (from the whole of last year to February of this year), I sent more than sixty manuscripts to the newspaper. Among them were not only news reports and novels, but also some very important political materials. Since the "Three-Anti" campaign, I have also sent some very important letters of accusation. Doing so is naturally the responsibility we should fulfill to the Party newspaper. The Xi'an Masses Daily should also provide certain education and communication to correspondents like me. However, strangely, in more than a year, I have never received a letter or a returned manuscript. Some of the manuscripts I sent were published, but I have never received a single payment. To improve this situation, I have written about ten letters to the editorial department of the Xi'an Masses Daily, putting forward our hopes and requirements, but our requirements have been like a stone thrown into the sea, with no response. I hope that the editorial department of the Xi'an Masses Daily will thoroughly correct this bureaucratic style in the "Three-Anti" movement and strengthen the connection between the Party newspaper and the masses.

    The Small Railroad Tracks Near the Mixed Warehouse of a Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district Should be Dismantled and Properly Preserved
    Editor: Near the mixed warehouse of a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district, there are thousands of meters of small railroad tracks. These railroad tracks are no longer in use, but they have not been completely dismantled and stored, and are left to be exposed to wind and rain. In February and March 1951, someone raised this issue in the Shijiazhuang Daily and suggested that they be dismantled and preserved quickly, but to this day, these railroad tracks are still unattended. It is intolerable that the relevant responsible persons treat the people's property with a bureaucratic attitude.
    I suggest again that the relevant departments check and deal with this matter quickly.

    Certain Newspapers and Magazines Should Pay Attention to Correcting Errors in the Years, Months, and Dates in Articles
    Editor: I often find errors in the years, months, and dates in certain newspapers and magazines. For example, in an article in the Chahar Daily on March 2 about the suspension of Jiao Yubo for reflection, it says: "...announced his suspension on the 24th of this month," and then again, "...announced his suspension on February 24th..." The "this month" in the first sentence is clearly "February," but it is obviously wrong to publish it in a March newspaper. This is caused by the negligence of the editors. I hope that newspapers and magazines in various places will pay attention to this issue and eliminate similar errors.

    来信摘要
    肃清遗传学中的唯心观点
    编辑同志：在遗传学领域中清除反动的唯心主义的孟德尔——莫尔根学说影响，是遗传学界的迫切任务之一。但是，最近我读了一本牟鸿彝编的“结婚医学”（上海北新书局一九五一年七月三版），该书编者竟以五十页的篇幅，对孟德尔——莫尔根学说加以盲目的宣扬，错误地认为孟德尔“发明了真确的遗传定律”，认为“犯罪这件事，……也还是先天遗传的原因，比环境的原因大得很多。”这种违反科学的说法是令人不能容忍的。希望该书编者注意纠正。　　　　袁瑞芳　李俊民
    “新中国的合作事业”一书内容有错误
    编辑同志：“新中国的合作事业”（张亦光、章普安著，棠棣出版社一九五一年十月再版）一书中，有些错误应该修正。例如作者在第三章“特种合作社的内容”一节中说：“就目前来说，只有一种合作货栈是属于此种性质的。”其实，合作货栈只是各级联社的信托业务机构，而决不能称为特种合作社。又如作者在第八章“苏联合作社发展情形”一节中说：“一九二八年时，政府开始对合作社重视，并扶助合作社经济的发展。”这是完全不合事实的。早在一九一九年列宁就已说过：“关于合作社的事情，从一九一八年四月起我们就已费尽心力来料理”（“列宁文选”莫斯科中文版，下册、五三五页）。作者对许多事实还没有搞清楚，就著书立说了，这说明作者对著书的工作是不严肃的。该书还有不少错误，作者应该迅速加以修正。

    西安群众日报应该加强和群众联系的工作
    编辑同志：西安群众日报的群众工作，是有严重的缺点的。这种缺点，已在我们部队中造成了极不好的影响。举一个例子来说：在一年零两个月（去年全年至今年二月）当中，我先后转给该报的稿件达六十多次。其中除通讯、小说外，还有一些很重要的政治材料。“三反”以来，我还转去一些很重要的检举信件。这样做，自然是我们对党报应尽的责任。西安群众日报对于像我这样的通讯员，也应进行一定的教育和联系。可是，很奇怪，一年多来，我从来没有接到过一次来信或退稿，我转去的稿件，有些是发表了，但没有收到过一次稿费。为了改善这种状况，我曾向西安群众日报编辑部写过十来封信，提出我们的希望和要求，但我们的要求却如石沉大海，没有一点回响。我希望西安群众日报编辑部在“三反”运动中彻底纠正这种官僚主义作风，密切党报和群众的联系。

    石家庄军分区某部混合仓库附近小铁轨应拆下妥为保存
    编辑同志：石家庄军分区某部混合仓库附近，铺着数千公尺长的小铁轨。这些铁轨现在没有用处了，但并没有完全拆下来加以保管，任其遭受风吹雨淋。一九五一年二、三月间，曾有人在石家庄日报上提出这件事，并建议赶快拆下保存，但到现在，这些铁轨依然无人过问。有关负责人用官僚主义态度对待人民财产，是令人不能容忍的。
    我再次建议，请有关方面赶快检查处理。

    某些报纸杂志应注意改正文章中年、月、日的错误
    编辑同志：我在某些报纸杂志上，经常发现年、月、日发生错误的现象。如三月二日察哈尔日报所载关于焦玉波停职反省一文中：“……在本月二十四日宣布停止他的工作”句后，又写“……二月二十四日宣布停止……”。前句中的“本月”显然是“二月”，但在三月的报上登出，就显然错了。这是编辑人员的疏忽造成的。希望各地报纸和杂志注意这个问题，消灭类似的错误。
