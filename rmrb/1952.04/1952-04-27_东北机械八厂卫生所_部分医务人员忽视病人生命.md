    Northeast Machinery Factory No. 8 Clinic
    Some Medical Staff Neglect Patients' Lives

    To the Editor: The medical staff at the Northeast Machinery Industry Bureau's No. 8 Factory Clinic have a terrible attitude and are completely irresponsible towards patients. The clinic staff appear to be on time for work, but they take three breaks in between. When it's break time, they ignore patients, even if a patient has an emergency, they say, "It's break time! Wait a while!" Jing Maoshan, an employee of Factory No. 8, criticized this phenomenon. Dr. Yu Yawen of the clinic not only did not correct the behavior but instead wrote to the administrative leaders and the labor union saying, "Jing has consistently been making trouble in the clinic and should be given more education." Liu Mingjiu, a worker in the Fifth Workshop, suffered from mental illness and personally went to the clinic for treatment. The clinic's director, Yi Kejiu, told him, "We can't treat you. If you want treatment, the factory director will have to hire several doctors for you." On April 16th, Wang Diren, a worker from the Second Workshop, came in for treatment of an injury. It was very cold that day, and Wang Diren was shivering. The nurses in the clinic had quilts but refused to give him one. In February, Dr. Yu Yawen treated Zhang Shoukun's child, but he did not prescribe the medication according to the dosage, causing the child to become poisoned after taking the medicine, and died despite emergency treatment. They even allow people who do not understand basic medical knowledge to give patients injections. In the clinic, one can often hear the phrase, "Pay for treats and gifts, and I'll give you some good medicine." This is a chronic problem in the clinic. Once, Dr. Yu Yawen insisted on demanding two packs of cigarettes from a patient, otherwise, he would not give treatment. The employees of Factory No. 8 are very dissatisfied with their attitude of neglecting the safety of workers' lives. In order to protect the health of the workers, I suggest that the leaders of Factory No. 8 educate and criticize them, urging them to change their attitude and serve the people well.

    东北机械八厂卫生所
    部分医务人员忽视病人生命
    编辑同志：东北机械工业管理局第八厂卫生所部分医务人员作风恶劣，对病人毫不负责。卫生所人员表面按时上班，但中间要休息三次。一到休息时间，他们就不管病人了，即使病人有急事，他们也说：“休息啦！等一会吧！”八厂职员荆茂珊对这种现象提出批评，该所于亚文大夫不但不改正，反而写信给行政领导方面和工会说：“荆一贯在卫生所捣蛋，应对他加强教育。”五车间工人刘明久患精神病，曾亲自到卫生所去诊治。该所所长易克就对他说：“我们不能治。要治就得由厂长给你另雇几个大夫。”四月十六日，二车间工人王迪仁来治伤，那天很冷，冻得王迪仁直抖，所里护士有被子却不给盖。二月，于亚文大夫给工人张守训的孩子看病，他不按剂量开药，致小孩服药后中毒，急救无效死亡。他们甚至叫不懂医药常识的人给病人注射。在卫生所里，经常可以听到“拿钱请客，就给你配点好药”这句话，这是卫生所的老毛病。有一次于亚文大夫向病人硬要两包烟，否则就不给治病。八厂职工是非常不满意他们这种忽视工人生命安全的作风的。为了保护工人的健康，我建议八厂领导方面对他们进行教育和批评，要他们转变作风，好好为人民服务。    王明武
