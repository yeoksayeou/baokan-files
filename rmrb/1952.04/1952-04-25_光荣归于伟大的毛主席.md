Glory to the Great Chairman Mao
Creator of the "Rapid Literacy Method," Qi Jianhua

I am deeply honored to have received the award for the "Rapid Literacy Method" personally presented by Director Guo Moruo of the Central Committee of Culture and Education. This is not only a great encouragement to me personally, but also a glory to all cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army.

The success of the "Rapid Literacy Method" should first be attributed to the leadership of the Party and higher authorities. As early as August 1, 1950, Chairman Mao explicitly instructed us that the cultural education of the troops must adopt the policy of being "rapid, practical, and yet regular." Under the guidance of this correct educational policy, our troop's cultural education has made tremendous progress and rapid advancements over the past year, especially in improving teaching quality and methods. In the initial exploratory stage, the "Rapid Literacy Method" was still very rough and incomplete. It was only after repeated experiments in the Southwest Military Region, the General Political Department of the Military Commission, and various troops over the past year, with continuous improvements and enhancements, that this method gradually became richer and more complete. Therefore, without the wise instructions of the Party, without the attention and support of the leadership, without the common practice of the masses, and without the joint and active research of the comrades in the propaganda and education work of the troops, it would be difficult to imagine such a "Rapid Literacy Method." Obviously, this creation should first be attributed to the Party, to the masses, and to the great Chairman Mao!

The success of the "Rapid Literacy Method" in the troops is not solely due to the method itself, but primarily based on the high political consciousness, the spirit of conscious learning, and the perseverance of hard study and research of our troops. The entire teaching process of the "Rapid Literacy Method" is permeated with an intense and concentrated teaching process. This requires a high degree of initiative, proactivity, and conscientiousness from the students. Just like in combat, it requires strong fighting spirit and firm determination and perseverance. This courage is built on a strong foundation of learning consciousness. The political and cultural education work of the troops has consistently emphasized the teaching experience of the mass line and the teaching methods that are linked to reality. The strong guarantee of political work, the diverse teaching activities, and the promotion of revolutionary heroism have all enriched the content of the "Rapid Literacy Method" and constitute the main part of the "Rapid Literacy Method." Without these fine traditions and experiences as a foundation, it would be difficult to imagine any "Rapid Literacy Method" created out of thin air.

The popularity of the "Rapid Literacy Method" among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is also due to the fact that the method itself is in line with the characteristics of adults and meets their thirst for learning. In numerous experiments, I have deeply realized that work can only be done well if we start from the object, go deep into reality, and go deep into the masses. I have not done enough in this regard and must continue to strengthen my mass viewpoint and my spirit of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At present, the People's Liberation Army is working hard to eliminate illiteracy, improve culture, and build a modernized national defense force. The responsible leaders of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government have also personally presided over many forums on the "Rapid Literacy Method" and organized experiments in many factories and rural areas. These fully demonstrate that our People's Government and People's Army attach great importance to the work of eliminating illiteracy and improving the cultural level of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the future, I must study more humbly, strive for progress, and live up to the encouragement and expectations of all the leaders. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably emerge." I will unite closely with comrades engaged in cultural and educational work, work together, give play to creativity, and fulfill my responsibility to the people and the soldiers in this high tide of cultural construction!

    光荣归于伟大的毛主席
    “速成识字法”创造者  祁建华
    我十分荣幸地接受了中央文化教育委员会郭沫若主任亲自颁给我的关于“速成识字法”的奖状。这不仅给予我本人莫大的鼓励，同时，这也是人民解放军全体文化工作者的光荣。
    “速成识字法”之所以能得到成功，首先应归功于党和上级的领导。远在一九五○年八月一日，毛主席即明确地指示我们，部队的文化教育，必须采取“速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的”方针。在这一正确的教育方针指导之下，一年多来，使我们的部队文化教育，有了巨大的发展和飞快的进步，特别是在提高教学质量和改进教学方法方面。“速成识字法”在我开始摸索的阶段，还是十分粗糙，极不完备的。经过了一年多来在西南军区、军委总政治部和各个部队反复的实验，不断地改进和提高，才使这一方法逐步地丰富和充实起来。所以说，没有党的英明指示，没有领导方面的重视、支持，没有群众的共同实践，没有部队宣教工作同志的共同积极钻研，也就很难设想有这样一个“速成识字法”。很明显，这个创造应当首先归功于党，归功于群众，归功于伟大的毛主席！
    “速成识字法”之所以能在部队中首先获得成功，还不单纯由于方法的本身，最主要是基于我们部队具有高度的政治觉悟，自觉学习的精神，和苦学钻研的毅力。“速成识字法”的全部教学过程，是贯串着一个紧张突击的教学过程。这就需要高度发挥学员的积极性、主动性和自觉性。正像作战一样，需要有旺盛的斗志和坚强的决心和毅力。这个勇气，是建筑在强烈的学习自觉的基础之上的。部队的政治、文化教育工作，都一贯重视群众路线的教学经验，和联系实际的教学方法，坚强的政治工作保证，多种多样的教学活动，和革命英雄主义的发扬，这些都丰富了“速成识字法”的内容，构成了“速成识字法”的主要部分。没有这些优良传统和经验作为基础，也很难设想有什么凭空创造的“速成识字法”的。
    “速成识字法”之所以受到广大工农兵群众的欢迎，还由于这个方法的本身是符合了成人的特点，满足了他们如饥如渴的学习要求。在屡次的实验中，使我更深切地体会到必须从对象出发，深入实际，深入群众，才能把工作做好。在这一方面我做得还很不够，还必须继续加强我的群众观念，和为工农兵服务的精神。目前，人民解放军正在努力消除文盲，提高文化，建设现代化国防军，中央人民政府教育部的负责首长也亲自主持了多次的关于“速成识字法”的座谈，并且在很多工厂和农村中组织了实验。这些都充分说明了我们的人民政府和人民军队都十分重视扫除文盲和提高工农兵的文化水平的工作。今后我一定要更虚心地学习，力求前进，不辜负各位首长对我的鼓励和希望。毛主席早经指出：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”我将和从事文教工作的同志紧紧团结在一起，共同努力，发挥创造性，在这一个文化建设的高潮中为人民、为士兵尽到我的责任！
