The first phase of the "Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei" in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has been basically completed. On April 10th, the project office held a water release ceremony at the head of the canal, officially naming the canal the "People's Victory Canal." The ceremony was attended by Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, and 39 representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources, Shandong Province, Henan Province water resources departments, and the Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and River Affairs Bureau, as well as 181 farmer representatives from the irrigation areas of Xinxiang, Huojia, Jixian, Yuanyang, and Yanjin.

The design of this project began in the autumn of 1950, with partial construction starting in March 1951. Full-scale construction began in September, and the first phase was basically completed by the end of the year. It can now irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland in Xinxiang and Huojia. The second phase is being rushed, and when fully completed by the end of June next year, it can irrigate at least 860,000 mu of farmland in Xinxiang, Huojia, Jixian, Yuanyang, Yanjin, Bo'ai, and Wuzhi counties. After the water is diverted to Jiwei, it will also ensure year-round navigation for 200-ton ships on the Wei River (excluding the freezing period). The four drop structures (where the terrain suddenly drops significantly as the river flows downstream, requiring the use of sturdy materials for construction to reduce the scouring force and velocity of the water and protect the riverbed) can all be used for power generation.

At the water release ceremony, Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, Han Peicheng, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei, farmer representatives from the irrigation area, and guests from various agencies all spoke. Vice Chairman Luo Yuchuan pointed out in his speech that the "People's Victory Canal" is of great significance, which can be summarized in three points: First, such a huge water conservancy project can only be built after the victory of the people's revolution. In the past, the Japanese invaders also started digging the "Little Yellow River" in order to plunder the people's property and transport weapons from Tianjin, but they were fiercely opposed by the people and failed to complete it. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the corrupt Kuomintang never thought of doing anything beneficial to the people. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can such a great project beneficial to the people be completed. Second, the success of this project is the beginning of transforming the Yellow River into a beneficial river for the people. In the future, water conservancy will be further developed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, so that the lives of our people in the Yellow River area will become better and better day by day. Third, after the Yellow River water is used for irrigation, many changes will take place in agricultural production. Yellow River water can be used to slowly turn saline-alkali land into good land; in the past, production depended on rainfall, and planting and harvesting could not be done in a timely manner. In the future, it will be possible to sow seeds in a planned and timely manner. He called on all farmers in the irrigation area to overcome selfish and conservative ideas, protect the canal together, quickly establish the organizational structure of the irrigation area, strengthen the management of the canal, convene a representative meeting of the irrigation area, and implement democratic management.

Next, farmer representatives from the irrigation area reported on the farmers' cheers and joy upon seeing the Yellow River water being used for irrigation, and their determination to protect and manage the canal. Yang Guiren, the representative of Kang Village in the Fourth District of Huojia County, said: "When we started digging the canal, the masses said: The Yellow River is a heartless water. If it is not managed well after it is opened, everything will be flooded. After seeing the Yellow River water flowing steadily, the masses said again: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Yellow River has also become honest. We must take care of the canal like we take care of our parents."

At 12:00 noon, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the headgate of the canal. After Vice Chairman Luo Yuchuan personally cut the ribbon, the gate was lifted. The surging Yellow River water poured into the main canal through the gate. At this time, all the representatives who came to observe the ceremony, especially the farmer representatives, witnessed the successful completion of the people's great project. The Yellow River water, which had always been likened to a "flood beast," began to be tamed for the first time under the control of the people, and they cheered incessantly.

    引黄灌溉济卫第一期工程胜利完成
    “人民胜利渠”已经正式放水
    黄河下游“引黄灌溉济卫”的第一期工程已经基本完成。四月十日，工程处在渠首举行了放水典礼，把这条渠道正式命名为“人民胜利渠”。参加典礼的有平原省人民政府副主席罗玉川和中央水利部、山东省、河南省水利部门及平原省水利局河务局等机关的代表三十九人，有来自新乡、获嘉、汲县、原阳、延津的灌溉区农民代表一百八十一人。
    这个工程是在一九五零年秋开始设计的，一九五一年三月开始局部动工，九月工程全面展开，到年底第一期工程基本完成。现在已可灌溉新乡、获嘉的二十三万亩农田。第二期工程正在赶修，到明年六月底全部完成后，至少可灌溉新乡、获嘉、汲县、原阳、延津、博爱、武陟等县的八十六万亩农田。引水济卫之后，并可保证卫河常年（冰冻期除外）通航二百吨的轮船。四处跌水工程（在河水往下流时，忽然下面地形低的很多，在这里就必须用坚固的材料，建筑工程，这就叫跌水；它的作用是为了减少水的冲力和速度，保护河床），均可供发电之用。
    在放水典礼大会上，平原省人民政府副主席罗玉川、引黄灌溉济卫工程处副处长韩培诚及灌溉区农民代表、各机关来宾都讲了话。罗玉川副主席在讲话中指出：“人民胜利渠”的重要意义，概括起来有三点：一是巨大的水利工程只有在人民革命胜利之后才有修建的可能。过去日寇为了掠夺人民财产和从天津运送武器，也曾经动手挖过“小黄河”，遭到了人民的激烈反对，未能完成。日寇投降后，腐败的国民党，根本就没想到办对人民有利的事。只有在共产党毛主席领导下，才能够完成这样于人民有利的伟大工程。二是这一工程的成功，是人民变黄河为利河的开端。今后在黄河下游，将更多地发展水利，使我们沿黄区人民的生活一天一天地好起来。三是引黄灌溉后，农业生产会发生许多变化。可以用黄水把沙碱地慢慢地变成好地；过去生产靠天下雨，不能适时收种，今后就可以有计划地适时播种了。他号召所有灌溉区农民克服自私保守思想，大家的渠大家来保护，把灌溉区的组织机构迅速建立起来，加强渠道管理工作，召开灌溉区代表会议，实行民主管理。
    接着，灌溉区农民代表报告了农民看到引黄灌溉的欢呼、愉快情形，和保证爱护、管理渠道的决心。获嘉县四区亢村代表杨贵仁说：“开始挖渠时群众说：黄河是没有良心的水，要是扒开口管不好，啥就淹没了。当看到黄水平稳地流过来后，群众又说：在共产党毛主席领导下黄河也老实了。我们一定要像照顾父母一样地来照顾渠道。”
    中午十二时，在渠首闸上举行了剪彩礼。罗玉川副主席亲自剪彩后，闸门提起了。滚滚的黄水通过闸门涌入总干渠。这时，所有到场观礼的代表，特别是农民代表们，亲眼看到人民的巨大工程，胜利成功，一向被喻为“洪水猛兽”一般的黄水，第一次在人民控制下，开始驯服起来，都欢呼不止。
