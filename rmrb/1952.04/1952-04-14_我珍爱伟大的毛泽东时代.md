I am able to live in such a happy and free new society, living a truly human life. I feel boundless glory and joy.

I spent more than sixty years of hardship in the old society; it was truly unbearable! At that time, we often lacked one thing or another when eating. My fourth child died when he was only thirteen years old because we couldn't afford medical treatment. As he was dying, he begged me: "Dad... Dad, please... find... a... doctor! I... can't... hold... on..." My heart was cut like a knife. I hated myself for not being able to fulfill my responsibility as a father. Due to the many difficulties in life, my second child went down the mine to dig coal before he was even sixteen years old. He risked his life and suffered all kinds of hardships, but he never complained to me in order to support the family. My fifth child was of school age, but he was forced to drop out of school because we couldn't afford it. He was young, only eleven years old, and didn't understand who caused him to lose his education. He only thought he was unlucky to have a father like me. He opposed the father who wouldn't let him study, so he ran away. He ran away for more than three years, working as a laborer and a beggar, suffering all kinds of hardships. Fortunately, he didn't freeze or starve to death. And... ten thousand words cannot express the suffering of the old society. I thought I would never be able to turn over! I hated that my lifespan was too long. Why wasn't I dead at sixty years old? At that time, I always hoped to leave that rotten society sooner.

Dawn has broken! Beijing is liberated! Chairman Mao's radiance shines on Beijing! I never thought I could make it, that I could live to see this day. I simply cannot express how happy I am.

I encouraged my children to join the revolution, and soon they were successively admitted to revolutionary universities. I never expected that my children could go to college; none of the Gu family's ancestors had ever gone to college! Do I have such good "virtue"? No, it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who are cultivating and educating my children. When they graduated, my fifth child, Gu Yi, happily ran back to tell me: "Dad, the organization has approved it. They approved me to go south, and you now have a son in the People's Liberation Army! How glorious! Congratulations to you!" In July 1949, he joyfully joined the southward army. After that, I was called a "glorious military family member." During festivals, countless people came to offer condolences. Children wearing red scarves called me "Grandpa" looking at my white beard. Enthusiastic young students came to my home to offer condolences and said to me: "Your son has joined the army. If there's anything you need at home, you're old and your legs aren't nimble, just ask us to do it. Don't be polite, we're like your sons." Comrades from the district people's government and the police station often came to my home on behalf of the government to ask about my well-being. During festivals, I didn't have to worry about anything at all. They sent me flour, meat, everything! When I was sick, I took a letter of introduction to the designated hospital for treatment, and I didn't have to pay for medical expenses. For the cultural life of military families, the government often sent movie tickets and play tickets... These things are endless, just like a song says: "The kindness of the Communist Party can never be repaid!" I have never been able to sing, but now I always hum this song. When my daughter hears me sing, she says: "My dad is really getting younger!" Yes, I do feel that I have become much younger. I think everything in the new society is lovely, and everything is worth rejoicing about. Look! How many poor people have turned over and become masters. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could my son, who was once a beggar, go to college and become a soldier in the People's Liberation Army? If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could this old man, who was despised and oppressed in the old society, be respected? If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could the people be masters of their own affairs, and how could workers lead the state power? ... All this makes me happier the more I think about it, and the more I feel alive. I no longer hate my long lifespan. On the contrary, I hope to live a few more years to see the development of the new society. I hope I can have such good fortune.

Now my life is several times better than before liberation. My children have all joined the revolutionary work, so I don't have to worry too much about them. They wrote to me and told me: "Dad, you don't have to worry about your sons. The revolutionary family is much warmer than a personal family. Mom and Dad can only care about whether we're cold, warm, full, or hungry, but the revolutionary organization is always concerned about our progress and growth." In fact, I know that my children are much better in the revolutionary ranks than at home. The organization cares for them just as the government cares for military families. My son, Gu Yi, who is a soldier in the People's Liberation Army, once told me in a letter with satisfaction: "Dad, your son no longer complains about not being able to go to school. He can now write and calculate! He is already a correspondent for the military newspaper." My second son, Gu Zhong, also happily told me in a letter: "It was the Communist Party that cultivated me and educated me. I am now a correspondent for the Shenyang Daily (he is a worker in the Shenyang No. 12 Machine Factory). At the last evaluation meeting for labor models, I was also rated as a third-class model correspondent." Two people who didn't even graduate from elementary school can now become newspaper correspondents. This is really the good education of the Communist Party! On March 2nd, the People's Daily published a short article by my second son, Gu Zhong: "The Volunteers Are the Most Beloved People, and the Unscrupulous Merchants Are the Most Hateful People." When my daughter read it to me, I was extremely happy. He wrote it very vividly, as if he was scolding the unscrupulous merchants for me. These are all things that I could never have dreamed of before. Today, in the great era of Mao Zedong, everything has become a reality. Even an old man like me can have such a high social status, be loved and respected by the people, and live a free and happy life. I cannot forget, and I will never forget, that this glory and happiness was given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

Right at this moment, when we are living a happy life in the Mao Zedong era, the American imperialists dare to disrupt our happy life. They are jumping over the wall like dogs, desperately spreading bacteria in Korea and in Northeast China. This makes me feel indescribable anger. The American bandits want to poison the most beloved people who are protecting our peaceful life – the Chinese People's Volunteers; and they want to poison the broad masses of our motherland's people. They are using such a vicious trick, vainly trying to salvage their doomed fate. We must not tolerate it, we must not forgive this American bandit who is as insidious as a mosquito and as vile as a flea. We must not let them destroy our peaceful and happy life, never!

I am old, and my own strength is limited. I want to dedicate all four of my children (three sons and one daughter) to the motherland. If they can be assigned to the front line of eliminating bacteria, I will feel supreme glory and joy! Because: I cherish this great Mao Zedong era.

    我珍爱伟大的毛泽东时代
    军属  顾仲如  述
    岳君记
    我能够生活在这样幸福、自由的新社会里，过着真正的人的生活。感到无限的光荣和愉快。
    我在旧社会里过了六十多年的困苦日子，可真难熬呵！那时候经常吃了这顿缺那顿。我的第四个孩子刚刚十三岁的时候就因为得了病没钱医治而死去了。临死的时候他还哀求我：“爸……爸，给……我…找…个大……夫吧！我……挺不……住啊……”我的心像刀割一样，我恨我为什么不能尽到做父亲的责任。由于生活的多难，我的第二个孩子还不满十六岁就下窑挖煤去了。他冒着生命的危险，受尽了苦头儿，但是为了养活家里的人，他从来不抱怨我。我的第五个孩子正在求学的年龄，由于无力攻读被迫辍学。他年纪小，刚刚十一岁，还不懂得是谁使他失学，只以为有我这样的父亲太不幸运了。他光知道反对不让他读书的父亲，于是偷着跑了。跑出去了三年多，在外面做过苦工，也当过乞丐，同样受尽了千难万苦，侥幸没被冻死饿死。还有……千言万语也说不尽旧社会的苦难。我以为永远也不能翻身了！我恨自己的寿限太长，干吗六十多岁还不死，那时候我总希望早些离开那个腐烂的社会。
    天亮了！北京解放了！毛主席的光辉照耀到北京了！我没有想到我能熬过来，能熬到这一天。我简直不能说出我是怎样的高兴。
    我鼓励我的孩子参加革命，不久他们陆续考上了革命大学。我真没料到我的孩子也能上大学，顾家的祖祖辈辈也没有上过大学的呀！难道我有这么好的“德行”吗？不是的，这是毛主席、共产党要培养教育我的孩子。在他们毕业的时候，我的第五个孩子顾义乐颠颠地跑回来告诉我：“爸爸，组织上批准啦。批准我南下，您可有了一个人民解放军的儿子喽！多光荣呀，我给您恭喜啦！”一九四九年七月他兴高采烈地参加了南下大军。这以后我就被人称为“光荣军属”了。逢年过节，不知有多少人来慰问。扎着红领巾的孩子们，看着我满脸白胡子管我叫“爷爷”；热诚的青年学生们，到家慰问时对我说：“您的儿子参军了，家里有什么零事儿，您上年纪腿脚不伶俐，叫我们办，不用客气，我们像您的儿子一样。”区人民政府和派出所的工作同志代表政府经常到我家问寒问暖。过节过年一点儿也不用自己操心，什么面啦、肉啦送得全全的；有病时拿着介绍信到指定的医院去治，也不用花医药费；政府为了军属的文化生活，还经常给家里送来电影票、话剧票……这些事儿说也说不完，真像有个歌子说的：“共产党的恩情说不完哪！”我从来都不会唱歌，但是现在我总哼着这句歌儿。我的女儿一听见我唱，就说：“我爸爸真是反老还童啦！”是的，我的确觉得我年轻了不少，我觉得新社会什么都可爱，那一点儿都值得高兴。看吧！多少穷人都翻了身做了主人。要不是共产党、毛主席，我的做过乞丐的儿子怎么能上大学做解放军呢；要不是共产党、毛主席，我这个在旧社会被贱视被压迫的老头子，怎么能受到尊敬呢；要不是共产党、毛主席，人民哪里会当家做主，工人怎能会领导国家政权呢？……这一切都使我越想越高兴，越觉着活得起劲儿。我再也不恨我的寿限长了，相反地，我希望多多活几年，好好看看新社会的发展。我愿自己能有这样的福气。
    现在我的生活比解放前改善了几倍。孩子们都参加了革命工作，也不用我多操心了。他们来信这样告诉我：“爸爸，您不用惦念着您的儿子，革命的大家庭可比个人的家庭要温暖得多，爸爸妈妈只能关心我们的寒暖饱饿；而革命组织却时刻关怀着我们的进步成长。”其实我知道我的孩子在革命的队伍里要比在家里好得多，组织上关怀他们正像政府关怀军属一样。我那个当解放军的儿子顾义曾在一封信里满意地告诉我：“爸爸，您的儿子现在再不为失学叫苦了，他已经能写会算啦！他已经是军报的通讯员了。”我的二儿子顾众也在一封信里高兴地告诉我：“是共产党培养了我，教育了我，我已经是沈阳日报（他在沈阳市机器十二厂当工人）的通讯员了，上次开评选劳动模范会还把我评成三等模范通讯员呢。”小学都没毕业的两个人，今天居然能成为报社通讯员，这真是共产党教育的好啊！三月二日人民日报上登载了我的二儿子顾众的一篇短文：“志愿军是最可爱的人，奸商是最可恨的人”，当我的女儿念给我听的时候，我真高兴极了，他写得挺生动的，好像代我骂了奸商一样。这些都是在从前梦也梦不到的事情。今天在伟大的毛泽东的时代里，一切都成为事实了。竟连我这个老头子也能有这么高的社会地位，受到人民的爱戴和尊敬，过着自由幸福的生活。我不能忘记，我永远也不能忘记这光荣幸福是毛主席、共产党给我的。
    就在这个时候：当我们在毛泽东时代正过着幸福生活的时候，美帝国主义胆敢要破坏我们这幸福的生活。它狗急跳墙、穷凶极恶地在朝鲜、在我国东北撒布细菌，这使我感到无法形容的愤怒。美国强盗想毒害保卫我们的和平生活的最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军；更想毒害我们祖国广大的人民。它拿出这么毒辣的一着儿，妄想挽回已注定的失败的命运。我们决不能容忍，我们决不能饶恕这个跟蚊子一样阴险的、跟跳蚤一样卑污的美国强盗，决不能让它破坏了我们和平幸福的生活，决不能！
    我年纪老了，自己的力量有限，我要把我的四个孩子（三个儿子，一个女儿）全部贡献给祖国，如果他们能被分配到消灭细菌的最前线，我将会感到无上的光荣和快慰！因为：我珍爱这伟大的毛泽东时代。
