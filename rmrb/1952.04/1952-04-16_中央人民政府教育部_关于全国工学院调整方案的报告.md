Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government
Report on the Adjustment Plan for National Institutes of Technology
(Report by Minister Ma Xulun at the 113th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on November 30, 1951, approved by the same meeting)

The National Conference of Presidents of Institutes of Technology opened on November 3, 1951, and closed on November 9 after six days of reports and discussions. Attendees included presidents of engineering colleges and independent institutes of technology from across the country, some university provosts, representatives from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and its affiliated ministries and commissions and other relevant departments, and representatives from the education departments (cultural and educational departments) of major administrative regions, along with personnel from the Ministry of Education, totaling 77 people.

Currently, there are 42 institutes of technology, six universities with engineering departments, and 17 industrial vocational schools nationwide. These schools have a total of 42 departments and 44 specialties and specialized courses. The total number of students is more than 42,000. These institutions have many serious shortcomings: their geographical distribution is very unreasonable; faculty and equipment are scattered, making their use extremely uneconomical; departments are numerous and complex, teaching is impractical, and the training of talent is not specialized enough; the number of students is far from meeting the urgent needs of the country's current industrial construction. Therefore, the establishment and division of labor of higher industrial schools must be adjusted appropriately in a planned manner.

In order to combine with the needs of national construction, we consulted with the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and other relevant departments many times before the meeting to first determine the adjustment principles. After obtaining the consent of Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, we drafted a plan for adjusting the major national institutes of technology. Because there was relatively sufficient preparation before the meeting and the leading opinions were consistent, several policy reports were made during the meeting. Responsible comrades from the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Ministry of Transportation also gave reports on specific cases of cadres needed by each ministry. After repeated discussions, the attending representatives from various schools improved their thinking, gradually clarifying the importance of national industrial construction and the necessity of adjusting departments. They also recognized that under the circumstances that the national finance is still difficult and the national construction urgently needs a large number of technical cadres, it is necessary to use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to solve the problems. They all expressed their support for the adjustment principles we proposed. After detailed research, the following plan was finally formulated:

I. In 1952, a total of 29,500 undergraduate students and students of specialized and vocational schools will be enrolled in national institutes of technology. (If no adjustments are made, only 15,000 can be enrolled.) Among them, 55 percent are students of specialized and vocational schools, and 45 percent are undergraduate students.

II. The institutes of technology in North China, East China, and Central South China will be the focus of appropriate adjustments. The adjustment plan is as follows:

	1.  The departments of the School of Engineering of Peking University and the departments of engineering of Yenching University will be merged into Tsinghua University. Tsinghua University will be transformed into a multi-disciplinary industrial university, and the school name will remain unchanged. The colleges of Arts, Science, and Law of Tsinghua University and the departments of Arts, Science, and Law of Yenching University will be merged into Peking University. Peking University will become a comprehensive university. The name of Yenching University will be abolished.

	2. The School of Engineering of Nankai University and the School of Engineering of Tientsin University will be merged into Tianjin University.

	3.  Zhejiang University will be transformed into a multi-disciplinary industrial university, and the school name will remain unchanged. The Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering departments of Zhijiang University will be merged into Zhejiang University; the School of Arts of Zhejiang University will be merged into Zhijiang University.

	4.  The School of Engineering of Nanjing University will be separated and merged with the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering of Ginling University and the Department of Architecture of Zhijiang University to become an independent institute of technology.

	5.  The two aeronautical engineering departments of Nanjing University and Zhejiang University will be merged into Jiaotong University to form the School of Aeronautical Engineering.

	6.  The Department of Mining and Metallurgy Engineering of Wuhan University, the Department of Mining and Metallurgy of Hunan University, the Department of Mining and Metallurgy of Guangxi University, and the Department of Mining of Nanchang University will be adjusted and an independent institute of mining and metallurgy will be established in Changsha, Hunan Province, focusing on the training of personnel in the mining and smelting of non-ferrous metals, and the departments of coal mining and iron and steel smelting will be added.

	7.  The Department of Water Conservancy of Wuhan University, the Department of Water Conservancy of Nanchang University, and the Water Conservancy Group of the Department of Civil Engineering of Guangxi University will be merged to form the Institute of Water Conservancy, which will remain at Wuhan University.

	8.  The School of Engineering of Zhongshan University, the School of Engineering of South China United University, the engineering departments of Lingnan University, and the Guangdong Industrial Vocational School will be merged to become an independent institute of technology.

III. In addition, the three institutes of technology in Northeast China will not be changed for the time being, but they must implement a focused division of labor. The specific plan will be further studied by the persons in charge of the three schools. The aeronautical engineering specialty of the Southwest Industrial Vocational School will be merged into the Beijing Institute of Technology (i.e., the former North China University School of Engineering).

IV. It has been decided to implement a division of labor among the departments of the institutes of technology in the same region. For example, Jiaotong University and Tongji University have already made specific division of labor plans for their respective departments. A professional conference of departments of the same type across the country will be convened to discuss the division of labor.

V. In order to strengthen the leadership of political and ideological education in the national institutes of technology, each institute of technology will prepare to pilot the political counselor system, with dedicated personnel serving as political counselors at all levels to preside over political study and ideological remolding work.

Regarding the funds for implementing the above adjustment plan and increasing student enrollment plan, a budget has been drafted after several consultations, and special funds will be allocated in addition to the original budget for education expenses. It is estimated that the problem can be solved by using revolutionary spirit and simple methods.

In order to implement the above resolutions, the following issues need to be resolved:

First, in 1952, national institutions of higher learning plan to enroll 50,000 new students, of which 29,500 will be enrolled in institutes of technology and 20,500 in other departments. However, in 1952, there are only 36,000 senior high school graduates nationwide, which is still about 14,000 short even if all of them apply to institutions of higher learning. It is proposed to consult with relevant parties to transfer younger, suitably educated cadres or other personnel to make up the difference.

Second, the number of faculty members in institutes of technology will gradually be insufficient. There are currently 1,300 teaching assistants in national institutes of technology. In 1952, they should be promoted to lecturers as much as possible to teach basic courses in engineering. Moreover, due to the sudden increase in the number of new students, it is necessary to supplement 1,500 teaching assistants (917 of whom are teaching assistants in institutes of technology, and the rest are teaching assistants in colleges of science and political courses). It is hoped that this number can be supplemented by retaining graduates in 1952 in consultation with the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government.

Third, new students will be enrolling in August and September 1952, so houses must be built in advance and instruments must be ordered or materials must be purchased for self-manufacture as soon as possible. Therefore, the allocation of funds must be timely. Please notify relevant departments of the Government Administration Council to assist the construction work of various schools, especially the purchase of materials and contracting.

Fourth, the phenomenon of various business departments soliciting teachers from various universities still exists. It is hoped that this can be effectively stopped. In addition to our initiative in closely contacting the relevant departments, we also hope that the various business departments will further assist the schools in solving the difficulties of faculty and internships. In particular, the inland schools need the assistance of nearby factories and mines.

Fifth, according to statistics from all parties, if national institutes of technology enroll 29,500 students in 1952, they will have reached saturation. Please notify the industrial departments and local people's governments of the Government Administration Council not to entrust the schools with short-term training classes in a piecemeal manner. If it is necessary to entrust them, it should be adjusted within the original enrollment quota of the relevant departments and no additional enrollment quotas should be added.

    中央人民政府教育部
    关于全国工学院调整方案的报告
    （一九五一年十一月三十日马叙伦部长在政务院第一百一十三次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    全国工学院院长会议于一九五一年十一月三日开幕，经过六天的报告和讨论，于十一月九日闭幕。出席这次会议的有全国各大学工学院及独立工学院院长，部分大学教务长，政务院财政经济委员会及其所属各部会和其他有关部门代表，各大行政区教育部（文教部）代表，连同本部出列席人员共计七十七人。
    目前全国共有工学院四十二所，大学设有工程系科的六所，工业专科学校十七所。这些学校共有四十二种系和四十四种专科与专修科。学生总共四万二千多人。这些院校存在着很多严重的缺点：在地区分布上很不合理；师资设备分散，使用极不经济；系科庞杂，教学不切实际，培养人材不够专精；学生数量更远不能适应国家当前工业建设的迫切需要。因此，高等工业学校的院系设置与分工，必须作有计划的适当的调整。
    为了结合国家建设需要，我们在会前曾和中央人民政府重工业部、燃料工业部及其他有关部门进行多次协商，先确定调整原则，并经商得政务院财政经济委员会李富春副主任的同意，乃作出了一个全国主要工学院调整方案的草案。由于在会前有比较充分的酝酿和准备，领导意见一致，在会议中又作了几次政策报告，重工业部、燃料工业部、交通部的负责同志也来作了关于各部需要干部具体事例的报告，并经过反复讨论后，各校出席代表们在思想上都有所提高，逐渐明确了国家工业建设的重要性和调整院系的必要。也认识到在国家财政尚有困难，国家建设又迫切地需要大量技术干部的情况下，必须用革命的精神和革命的办法来解决问题。对我们所提调整原则都表示拥护，经过详尽研究，最后拟定了下列的方案：
    一、一九五二年全国工学院本科生及专修科与专科学校学生共招二万九千五百名。（如不经调整，只能招一万五千名）其中百分之五十五为专修科与专科学校学生，百分之四十五为本科生。
    二、以华北、华东、中南三个地区的工学院为重点作适当的调整，其调整方案如下：
    1、将北京大学工学院、燕京大学工科方面各系并入清华大学。清华大学改为多科性的工业高等学校，校名不变。将清华大学的文、理、法三学院及燕京大学的文、理、法方面各系并入北京大学。北京大学成为综合性的大学。燕京大学校名撤销。
    2、将南开大学的工学院及津沽大学的工学院合并于天津大学。
    3、将浙江大学改为多科性的工业高等学校，校名不变。将之江大学的土木、机械两系并入浙江大学；浙江大学的文学院合并于之江大学。
    4、将南京大学的工学院划分出来和金陵大学的电机工程系、化学工程系及之江大学的建筑系合并成为独立的工学院。
    5、将南京大学、浙江大学两个航空工程系合并于交通大学，成立航空工程学院。
    6、将武汉大学的矿冶工程系、湖南大学的矿冶系、广西大学的矿冶系、南昌大学的采矿系调整出来，在湖南长沙成立独立的矿冶学院，以培养有色金属的采矿冶炼人材为主，并增设采煤系及钢铁冶炼系。
    7、将武汉大学的水利系、南昌大学的水利系、广西大学土木系的水利组合并，成立水利学院，仍设于武汉大学。
    8、将中山大学的工学院、华南联合大学的工学院、岭南大学工程方面的系科及广东工业专科学校合并成为独立的工学院。
    三、此外，东北三个工学院暂不予变动，但须实行重点分工，具体方案由三校负责人作进一步的研究。西南工业专科学校航空工程专科，则并入北京工业学院（即原华北大学工学院）。
    四、同一地区的工学院系，决定实行分工；如交通大学、同济大学的各系已作出具体分工的方案。关于全国同样系的分工，得召开分系专业会议讨论。
    五、为了加强全国工学院的政治思想教育的领导，各工学院有准备地试行政治辅导员制度，设立专人担任各级政治辅导员，主持政治学习思想改造工作。
    关于实现上述调整方案和增招学生计划的经费，几经磋商，拟定了预算，在原订教育经费概算以外另拨专款支用。估计用革命的精神，因陋就简的办法，能解决问题。
    为实现上述各项决议，还有下列几个问题需要解决：
    第一，一九五二年全国高等学校拟招收新生五万名，其中工学院招二万九千五百名，其他院系招二万零五百名。但一九五二年全国高级中学毕业生只有三万六千名，即使全部投考高等学校，也尚差一万四千名左右。拟请商同有关方面从在职干部或其他人员中抽调年龄较轻、具有相当文化水平的人补足此数。
    第二，工学院师资将逐年不够，全国工学院现有助教一千三百名，一九五二年尽量提升为讲师教工程一类的基础课程，又因新生骤增，必须补充一千五百名助教（内九百十七名为工学院助教，其余为理学院及政治课助教），此数希望商同中央人民政府人事部在一九五二年毕业生中留用补充。
    第三，一九五二年八、九月间，新生即将入学，房屋必须先期修建，仪器亦须尽先定购或买材料自制，因此经费的拨给必须及时。请政务院通知有关部门对各校修建工作特别是购料、承包等，予以协助。
    第四，各业务部门仍有向各大学拉聘教师现象，望能作有效地制止。除我们主动地密切与各有关部门的联系外，也希望各业务部门更进一步地协助各校解决师资及实习的困难。特别内地各校更需要附近厂矿的协助。
    第五，根据各方统计，全国各工学院在一九五二年如招足二万九千五百名学生，已达饱和程度，请政务院通知各工业部门及地方人民政府，勿再零星委托各校办理短期班。若必须委托办理，应在有关系科的原定招生名额内调剂，不另增加招生名额。
