The Tongjuxing Electric Mill in Baoding City, Hebei Province, was a rice and flour shop powered by animals before liberation. After liberation, it developed with the support of the People's Government and was transformed into an electric mill. However, the manager, Li Shaonan, was not satisfied with this. He was insatiable and ungratefully attacked the state. When milling rice for the state-owned grain company, he produced shoddy goods and underreported the rice yield. He used the money the state bank lent him to collude with four illegal merchants to engage in speculation and profiteering. He used tax evasion as a means to make a fortune. In this way, he stole state assets worth about 100 million yuan. When he heard about the "Five-Anti" campaign, he quickly paid the workers five months' worth of wages in an attempt to get through it.

Before the "Five-Anti" campaign, the workers of Tongjuxing did not clearly understand Li Shaonan's various crimes. They did not participate in the trade union, nor did they engage in study. At that time, they did not believe that the trade union could solve any problems for them. They thought, "Anyway, if you don't work hard, they won't let you eat." They also knew that their wages were low and their working hours were long, but because Li Shaonan was very good at pretending to care about the welfare of the workers. When the workers were so tired that they couldn't eat, he would quickly pretend to care about them; when the workers were sick, he would occasionally "generously" buy them something to eat. In this way, some workers had a feeling of "gratitude" to the manager. But when they worked for fifteen hours and were exhausted, they secretly hoped for a better day.

When the "Five-Anti" struggle began, some workers did not pay attention to this great struggle. Until the work team came to the factory to urge Li Shaonan to confess his illegal activities, some workers still said, "Could it be that the boss really has a problem?" Some workers were also worried that "if the manager is arrested, our jobs will be gone." After the work team discovered these ideological problems of the workers, they repeatedly explained to them the meaning of the "Five-Anti" campaign and the truth of "who supports whom," as well as the determination of the People's Government to protect the interests of the workers, and introduced them to join the trade union. They saw that their class brothers were all fighting bravely, and their courage to fight also increased. The old worker Pan Yongqing, who had worked in the factory for twenty-five years and knew the most about the capitalist's illegal crimes, understood the truth that "we don't rely on the capitalist to eat, but the capitalist relies on us to make money" and "digging the corner of the state-owned grain company is harming the working class," so he exposed Li Shaonan's secret accounts. When those workers who did not know Li Shaonan's crimes saw his ugly face in the secret accounts, they were extremely angry. The worker Xing Gengchen said, "It turns out that the boss is smiling with a dagger hidden in his heart, cutting our flesh!" The workers unanimously angrily told Li Shaonan, "If you tell all the bad things, the government can give you a lenient punishment; if you only tell half of it, and keep half of it, we will not let you go." Li Shaonan, nicknamed "Little Zhuge" because of his many tricks, saw that the workers in his factory had risen up and that his crimes could not be denied, so he completely confessed his problems and exposed his accomplices.

The victory of the struggle encouraged the workers. They all said, "Capitalists are like wild horses, if you don't tighten the reins, they will kick over the pot." The workers recognized the leading role of the working class and the importance of consolidating the leadership of the working class in the struggle.

The Baoding City Grain Branch saw that Li Shaonan, under the education and exposure of the work team and the workers, had completely confessed his crimes and expressed remorse, so they re-entered into a processing contract with him for more than 119,000 catties of grain. The workers felt that the grain sent by the grain company was much more cordial than in the past. They not only sifted the grain twice more, but also sifted out the impurities in the rice—red sorghum and beans. The trade union leader Zhang Yin said, "Now I have strength all over, I must grind the rice better." As a result, both efficiency and quality improved. When delivering rice to the grain company, in addition to the amount that should be delivered according to the contract, there were more than 1,600 catties of rice. The workers proposed to the manager: "This rice belongs to the state and should be handed over to the grain company." Li Shaonan did so.

Because the Tongjuxing Electric Mill completed the processing task ahead of schedule, the Baoding City Trust Company entrusted the factory to process 30,000 catties of grain. Before signing the contract, the managers of other electric mills said, "This grain can produce at most 76 catties of rice per hundred catties." In order to prevent illegal capitalists from stealing state assets again, the workers of Tongjuxing first ground 2,000 catties of grain for testing. As a result, every hundred catties of grain produced 78 catties and three taels of rice. The contract was signed accordingly. Now, the workers have established their own diaries.

Li Shaonan saw that the company still gave him processing tasks; he also saw that the workers were actively producing, the efficiency was improved, and the quality of the rice produced was better, which won the trust of the company. He was both ashamed and grateful and said, "In the past, I harmed the public and deceived the workers; today, the public still has dealings with us, and the workers are working harder. I know the benefits of honestly obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class." He is willing to make the accounts public to the workers, discuss matters with the workers, and is willing to actively operate under the leadership of the working class and be an honest capitalist.

Now, at the suggestion of the workers, the labor and management of the Tongjuxing Electric Mill are preparing to hold a labor-management consultation meeting to discuss issues such as expanding production, adjusting wages, improving welfare, and improving the system.

    同聚兴电磨厂的工人发挥了领导作用
    蔚蓝
    河北省保定市同聚兴电磨厂，在解放前，是一个畜力拉磨的米面店；解放后，在人民政府的扶植下获得发展，改成了电磨厂。但是，经理李绍楠并不以此为满足，他贪得无餍，忘恩负义地向国家进攻。他给国营粮食公司碾米时，粗制滥造、少报出米率；他用国家银行贷给他的钱，联合了四家违法商人，投机倒把，牟取暴利；他把偷漏国税作为发大财的手段。这样，他先后盗窃国家资财一亿元左右。“五反”的风声传来，他连忙多发给工人们五个月的工资，企图混过关去。
    同聚兴的工人们，在“五反”以前，对李绍楠的种种罪恶是认识不清的。他们没有参加工会，也没有进行过学习。那时他们不相信工会能给他们解决什么问题。他们想：“反正不卖力气做活，人家不让吃饭。”他们也知道自己的工资低、工时长，可是因为李绍楠在他们面前很会做出一付关心工人福利的样子。工人干活累得吃不下饭去了，他就赶紧装模做样地问长问短；工人们病了，他间或也“慷慨”地给买点吃的东西。这样，有些工人就有了一种“感谢”经理的想法。但当他们工作了十五个钟头累得精疲力竭的时候，又暗暗地盼望着有个抬头的日子。
    “五反”斗争开始，有些工人对这个伟大的斗争并没有注意。直到工作组到厂里来督促李绍楠坦白违法行为时，有的工人还说：“莫非掌柜的真的有问题？”还有的工人耽心“经理被扣了，咱的饭碗也就打碎了”。工作组发现了工人这些思想问题后，就向他们反复讲解“五反”的意义和“谁养活谁”的道理，以及人民政府保障工人利益的决心，并介绍他们参加了工会。他们看到自己的阶级弟兄个个勇敢斗争，他们的斗争勇气也提高了。在厂里干了二十五年、最知道资本家违法罪行的老工人潘永清，想透了“不是咱靠资本家吃饭，而是资本家靠咱赚钱”和“挖国营粮食公司的墙角，就是坑工人阶级”的道理，就检举出李绍楠的后账。那些不知道李绍楠罪行的工人，从后账中看见了他的丑恶嘴脸时，都气愤极了。工人邢庚辰说：“原来掌柜的笑里藏刀，割咱们的生肉！”工人们一致愤怒地告诉李绍楠说：“你要是把坏事都倒出来，政府可以从轻处理你；你要吐出半截，留着半截，我们就不能放过你去。”鬼计多端绰号“小诸葛”的李绍楠看见本厂工人起来了，自己的罪恶赖不过去了，这才彻底坦白了问题，并且检举了他的同谋犯。
    斗争的胜利，鼓舞了工人。他们都说：“资本家好像野马，不勒紧缰绳，把锅也要踢翻的。”工人们在斗争中认识了工人阶级的领导作用和巩固工人阶级的领导权的重要。
    保定市粮食分公司看见李绍楠在工作组和工人们的教育检举下，彻底坦白了自己的罪行，并表示悔改，就重新和他订立了十一万九千多斤谷子的加工合同。工人们对粮食公司送来的谷子，感到比过去亲切多了。他们不但把谷子多筛了两遍，还把米里的杂质——红高粱、豆类都筛出去。工会组长张印说：“现在浑身是力气了，一定要把米碾好点。”于是效率和质量都提高了。向粮食公司缴米时，除了按合同规定应缴的以外，还多出了一千六百多斤米。工人们向经理提出：“这米是国家的，应当交给粮食公司。”李绍楠照办了。
    因为同聚兴电磨厂提前完成了加工任务，保定市信托公司又委托这个厂加工三万斤谷子。在订立合同前，其它电磨厂经理说：“这谷子每百斤顶多能出七十六斤米。”同聚兴的工人为了防止违法资本家再盗窃国家的资财，先碾了两千斤谷子作试验。结果每百斤谷子出到七十八斤三两米。合同就照这样订下来。现在，工人已经建立了自己的日记账。
    李绍楠看见公司照样给自己加工的任务；又见工人们积极生产，效率提高，出的米质量好了，博得了公司的信赖，他又惭愧又感激地说：“过去我一面坑公家，一面骗工人；今天，公家还跟咱来往，工人又多卖力气，我知道老老实实服从国营经济和工人阶级领导的好处了。”他情愿向工人公开账目，有事和工人商量，愿在工人阶级领导下积极经营，做一个规规矩矩的资本家。
    现在，在工人们的提议下，同聚兴电磨厂劳资双方正酝酿开劳资协商会议，准备商讨扩大生产、调整工资、搞好福利、改进制度等问题。
