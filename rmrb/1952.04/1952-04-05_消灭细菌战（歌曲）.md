Eliminate Germ Warfare

March tempo, with boundless anger, strong and forceful

Lyrics by Guo Moruo
Music by Lü Ji

Singing Instructions

Sing this song with boundless anger, expressing the Chinese people's firm determination to eliminate germ warfare.

The rhythm of the entire song should be clear and forceful. There are several places that require special attention, such as the first beat of the twentieth measure and the second beat of the twenty-fifth measure (same for the fortieth measure), the "消 (xiāo)" character in "消灭…… (xiāo miè...)" [eliminate...] should be sung with particular force, and attention should be paid to accurately singing the dotted notes. The phrases "捉拿细菌战犯 (zhuō ná xì jūn zhàn fàn)" [Capture the germ warfare criminals] in the twenty-ninth and thirtieth measures (same for the forty-fourth and forty-fifth measures) and the phrases beginning with "臭虫、虱子…… (chòu chóng, shī zi...)" [Bedbugs, lice...] in the thirty-fourth measure should be sung clearly, with a strong and forceful start to each measure. The entire song has several repeated sections, such as "美帝国主义万恶滔天 (Měi Dìguó zhǔyì wàn'è tāo tiān)" [American imperialism is utterly wicked], pay attention to the development of emotions while singing, becoming more and more energetic. "全中国全世界人民一致动员 (Quán Zhōngguó quán shìjiè rénmín yīzhì dòngyuán)" [The entire Chinese and world's people are united in mobilization] is the climax of the entire song, and should be sung particularly loudly. (Xu Yiyao)

    消灭细菌战
    进行曲速度、无比愤怒、强烈有力
    郭沫若词
    吕骥曲
    唱法说明
    唱这首歌要充满无比愤怒的情绪，要表现出中国人民决心消灭细菌战的坚强意志。
    全曲节拍都要唱得鲜明有力。有几处需特别注意的地方，如第二十小节第一拍和第二十五小节第二拍（第四十小节同）“消灭………”的“消”字要唱得特别有力，注意把附点音符唱准确。第二十九、三十小节的“捉拿细菌战犯”（第四十四、四十五小节同）和第三十四小节开始的“臭虫、虱子………”等字句要唱清楚，每小节开始一个音唱得强有力些。全曲有几个重复的段落，如“美帝国主义万恶滔天”等，唱时要注意情绪的发展，要越唱越有劲。“全中国全世界人民一致动员”是全曲的最高潮，要唱得特别响亮。（许仪曜）
