    Construction of Diversion Projects on the Main and Tributary Streams of the Huai River Intensified
    The diversion projects on the main and tributary streams of the middle reaches of the Huai River, part of the second year's Huai River harnessing project, are currently under intensive construction. 200,000 migrant workers participating in this project are successively heading to the construction sites from counties such as Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Xuyi, Sixian, Lingbi, and Jiashan.
    The Huai River's main and tributary diversion project is an important project to alleviate waterlogging disasters in the Suxian Special District of northern Anhui, and is also one of the important projects in the second year of the Huai River harnessing project. This project began construction last winter and is expected to be completed in 1953. Upon completion of the entire project, 10 million mu of farmland will directly or indirectly benefit.
    The central content of this project is to separate the tributaries such as the Hui River, Chong River, Tong River, and Tuo River, which flow into the Huai River downstream of Wuhe County, from the main stream of the Huai River, and direct them to Hongze Lake through a newly opened river channel. In this way, it can avoid the failure of the Huai River's main stream to discharge floodwaters during the summer and autumn floods, causing floods, and can prevent the backflow of floodwaters from the Huai River's main stream, so as to reduce waterlogging disasters in the Suxian Special District. The new river channel needs to pass through the Fengshan and Xiacaowan mountain ranges and hills, and the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo Rivers must also be reorganized, making the project extremely difficult. The entire project requires more than 17.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, of which more than 4 million cubic meters have been completed last winter. When excavating the new river channel east of Wuhe County, with a bottom width of 128 meters, a depth of 4.5 meters, and a length of 35 li, some places encountered groundwater and a large amount of silt. The migrant workers had to first excavate dragon ditches, use pumps to drain water, and first pick up the silt from the river to the shore, dry it, and then transport it to the soil-stacking area. In some places, it is necessary to cut off mountain ridges 15 meters to 35 meters high and transport more than 6 million cubic meters of soil to places 500 meters or 1,000 meters away. The migrant workers who went to the dam are full of enthusiasm. Now they are overcoming all difficulties and striving for the victory of opening up the new river.

    淮河干支流分流工程加紧施工
    第二年度治淮工程中的淮河中游干支流分流工程，目前正在加紧施工。参加这一工程的二十万民工，正陆续从怀远、五河、盱眙、泗县、灵璧、嘉山等县开赴工地。
    淮河干支流分流工程是解除皖北宿县专区内涝灾害的重要工程，也是第二年度治淮工程中的重要工程之一。这项工程在去年冬季开始施工，预计在一九五三年全部完成。全部工程完成后，将有一千万亩农田直接或间接受到益处。
    这项工程的中心内容，是将五河县以下汇入淮河的浍河、漴河、潼河和沱河等支流跟淮河干流分开，另经一新开的河道，使直接流入洪泽湖。这样，可以免除在夏秋洪水期间，淮河干流宣泄不及，发生水灾，并可防止淮河干流洪水倒灌，以减除宿县专区的内涝灾害。新河道需要经过峰山和下草湾两处山岭和岗地，浍、漴、潼、沱各河也须重加整理，工程异常艰巨。全部工程共需做土方一千七百六十多万公方，去冬已经完成四百多万公方。开挖五河县以东，底宽一百二十八公尺，深四点五公尺，长三十五华里的新河道时，有的地方遇到地下水和大量淤泥，民工们须先开挖龙沟，用抽水机排水，先把淤泥从河里挑到岸上，晒干以后，再往堆土的地区运送。有的地方须切断十五公尺到三十五公尺高的山岭，把六百多万公方土运到五百公尺或一千公尺以外的地方去。上堤民工热情饱满，现在他们正在排除万难，争取开挖新河的胜利。
