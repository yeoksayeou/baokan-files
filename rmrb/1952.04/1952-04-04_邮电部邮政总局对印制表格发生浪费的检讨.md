    To the Editor: We are grateful for Comrade Changyou's criticism. Early last year, our bureau invited experienced personnel from various regions to form a research group to formulate a set of "Operational Rules for Distribution Business" and planned to implement it uniformly across the country. During the "Three-Anti" movement, we initially discovered during our review that the formulation of these rules neglected economic accounting and blindly pursued "formalization," excessively emphasizing future development while overlooking current conditions. In particular, we failed to adequately learn from advanced Soviet experience and systematically summarize the practical experience of various regions in the past, committing serious bureaucratic and doctrinaire errors. As a result, some provisions in the rules are indeed cumbersome and wasteful of manpower and resources. For example, this is the case with the subscriber cards, delivery cards, and newspaper subscription forms mentioned by Comrade Changyou. The first two are largely unnecessary for second and third-class post offices, but we only catered to the larger offices with busier operations. This is definitely wasteful. The newspaper subscription form is not only wasteful but also inconvenient for subscribers and should be abolished. Subscriber cards are more flexible and durable than the book format currently used by various bureaus, and can save manpower and resources if the subscriber does not change. The newspaper subscription receipt is basically the same as the subscription form, and it corrects the waste of issuing multiple subscription forms for subscribers who subscribe to several newspapers. To unify the receipt styles of post offices at all levels and save resources, we believe that using the newspaper subscription receipt is correct. These are our bureau's opinions on the five types of forms. Currently, our bureau is continuing to deeply study the entire "Operational Rules for Distribution Business," the "Draft Measures for Accounting Treatment of Distribution Business," and all forms, sheets, registers, ledgers, etc., striving for simplification and rationality.

    邮电部邮政总局对印制表格发生浪费的检讨
    编辑同志：我们感谢畅邮同志的批评。我局在去年初，邀集各地较有发行工作经验的人，组成研究小组，制订了一套“发行业务办事细则”，并准备在全国统一实行。在“三反”运动中，我们初步检查到拟订这套细则时忽视企业经济核算，盲目追求“正规”，过份强调今后的发展，忽略了现实的条件。特别是没有很好地学习苏联先进经验，没有系统地总结过去各区的实际经验，犯了严重的官僚主义和教条主义错误。因此，该细则中有些规定确实是手续繁杂，浪费了人力物力。比如畅邮同志所指出的订户分卡、投递卡、报刊订阅单就是如此。前二种在二、三等邮局是不大需要的，而我们只照顾了业务比较繁忙的大局。这肯定是浪费的。报刊订阅单则不仅是浪费，即对订户也不方便，应当废除。订户卡在使用上比现在各局使用的簿子形式要灵活耐用，如果订户不变动，可以节省人力物力。报刊费收据与订报单基本上是一样的，还纠正了订户订阅数种报刊就填给数张订报单的浪费。为了统一各级邮局的收据式样及节约起见，我们认为使用报刊费收据是对的。这是我局对五种表格的意见。现在，我局对整个“发行业务办事细则”“发行账务处理办法草案”及所有表格、单式、簿籍、账册等正在继续深入研究，力求简化合理。
