The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
Emergency Notice Regarding the Prevention and Control of Insect Pests

    In order to overcome various crop diseases and insect pests, and to ensure increased production per unit area, this Council issued the "Instructions on the Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests in 1952" on March 26. According to the current agricultural situation, various insect pests are not only occurring widely, but also earlier than usual and are reproducing rapidly. More than ten types, such as wheat aphids, red spiders, wheat sawflies, locusts, rice borers, oilseed rape flea beetles, and wireworms, have already appeared. Wheat aphids and red spiders, in particular, have spread across more than eighty counties in Henan and Pingyuan provinces, and have also occurred extensively in southern Shanxi and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, seriously threatening wheat growth. Due to the severe insect damage last year and the lack of winter snow, insect pests have become widespread this year. We must anticipate the possibility of even more serious outbreaks of locusts, cotton aphids, rice borers and other insect pests this year. Therefore, in order to raise high alert and promptly take effective measures to prevent insect pests from causing disasters, the following emergency notice is issued:

    (1) In areas where insect pests have occurred, the prevention and control of insect pests should be the central task at present. Responsible cadres should be assigned to take concrete control. Local drought prevention and production offices must also include pest control as an important task. In areas where insect pests have not yet occurred, inspections should be carried out immediately. If a small number of insect pests have already occurred, they should be eliminated immediately to prevent them from spreading. All agricultural cadres who participated in the "Three-Anti" campaign should immediately return to their original posts and quickly organize pest control forces.

    (2) In areas where wheat aphids and red spiders have already occurred, the masses should be fully mobilized to eliminate them rapidly using various methods to ensure that they do not cause disasters. In areas where wheat midges have occurred in the past, pest control efforts should be strengthened. Other areas should also pay attention to inspection.

    (3) In the main locust areas of North China, East China, and Central South China, and in areas where locusts laid eggs last autumn, the hatching of locust eggs should be closely monitored based on the results of egg surveys. Strict surveillance should be maintained to ensure "early, minimal, and complete" elimination of locust nymphs before the third instar. In rice-growing areas, the policy of controlling rice borers in all seasons must be implemented. First, moth trapping and egg collection should be done well to curb the occurrence of the next generation of rice moths, laying the foundation for rice borer control throughout the year.

    (4) In cotton-growing areas, in addition to completing this year's sprayer supply plan and the repair of old sprayers, the Central Cooperative should guide the provincial cooperatives to be responsible for preparing a large amount of cotton oil soap to ensure sufficient pesticides for controlling aphids.

    (5) All localities should conduct regular inspections based on the historical occurrence of insect pests, pay close attention, and immediately implement prevention and control measures once insect pests occur. They should also report to higher authorities in a timely manner.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于防治害虫的紧急通知
    为了战胜各种农作物的病虫灾害，保证单位面积增产，本院曾于三月二十六日发布“关于一九五二年防治农作物病害虫害的指示”。根据目前农情，各种害虫不仅普遍发生，而且时间提早，繁殖很快，如麦蚜、红蜘蛛、麦叶蜂、蝗虫、螟虫、油菜金花虫、金针虫等已发生十余种之多，尤以麦蚜、红蜘蛛在河南、平原两省已蔓延八十余县，晋南和陕西关中地区，亦已普遍发生，小麦生长受到严重威胁。由于去年虫害大，冬雪少，今年虫害已普遍发生，必须估计到今年蝗虫、棉蚜、螟虫等害虫将有更加严重发生的可能。因此，为引起高度警惕，迅速采取有效措施，防止虫害成灾，特作紧急通知如下：
    （一）虫害发生地区，应以防治害虫为当前中心任务，抽调负责干部，实行具体掌握。各地生产防旱办公室必须同时把治虫列为重要工作。虫害未发生地区，应立即进行检查，如已有小量害虫发生，应立即消灭，以免蔓延。凡参加“三反”之农业干部，均应立即返回原工作岗位，迅速组织治虫力量。
    （二）麦蚜、红蜘蛛已经发生地区，应全面动员群众，用各种方法迅速消灭，保证不成灾害。曾经发生小麦吸浆虫地区，并应加强防治工作，其他地区，亦应注意检查。
    （三）华北、华东、中南主要蝗区及去秋飞蝗息落产卵地带，应根据查卵结果，侦察蝗卵孵化情况，严密监视，保证“打早、打少、打了”，把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前。水稻区必须贯彻四季治螟方针，首先做好捕蛾、采卵工作，遏止下代螟蛾的发生，打下全年治螟基础。
    （四）植棉地区，除完成今年的喷雾器供应计划，和旧喷雾器的修理工作外，中央合作总社应指导各省合作总社负责筹制大量棉油皂，以保证治蚜虫的足够的药剂。
    （五）各地根据历年虫害发生情况，随时检查，严密注意，一旦虫害发生，立即防治，并应及时上报。
    总理周恩来
    一九五二年四月二十二日
