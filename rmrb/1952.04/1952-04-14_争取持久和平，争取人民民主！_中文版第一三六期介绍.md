The Chinese edition of issue 136 of the Cominform newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Peace Budgets and War Budgets," stating that the law on the national budget for 1952 adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 8 once again vividly confirms that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is peace-loving. The Soviet budget is a budget for peace, demonstrating the ever-increasing power of the Soviet multinational state, the rapid development of its productive forces, and the growing strength of its planned, socialist economy. In the Soviet Union's 1952 budget, the budget revenue is 509.9 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 476.9 billion rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 32.9 billion rubles. Nearly two-thirds of the total budget expenditure is used for the development of the national economy and cultural undertakings. In the budget revenue, people's taxes account for only 9.3 percent of the total revenue. The vast majority of budget expenditures in people's democratic countries are also used for national economic development and social and cultural measures. However, the budgets of capitalist countries are completely opposite to those of peace, democracy, and socialist countries. They are budgets for war. For example, even according to official materials, direct and indirect military expenditures in the United States account for more than 80 percent of the total budget expenditure, France accounts for 50 percent, and Britain and Italy account for more than 50 percent. At the same time, appropriations for social and cultural needs are reduced to negligible amounts. The editorial concludes by emphasizing that from the comparison of the budgets of the countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism with the budgets of capitalist countries, the people of all countries can clearly know who are friends and who are enemies; who is safeguarding peace and who is madly preparing for war.

This issue publishes an article by French Communist Party Central Committee member Cogniot, "A Brilliant Work on the Ideological Foundation of a Revolutionary Marxist Party," commemorating the 50th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's famous work "What Is to Be Done?" Cogniot said: Fifty years have passed since the publication of Lenin's work "What Is to Be Done?" The international significance of this brilliant work by Lenin is truly immeasurable. Communists in all countries are tirelessly learning and will continue to learn how to build and consolidate Communist and Workers' Parties, relying on the vibrant Leninist ideas expounded in this book. Cogniot then analyzed the historical background in which Lenin's masterpiece was produced, pointing out that Lenin's "What Is to Be Done?" was published in 1902. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, capitalism had developed to its highest stage—the stage of imperialism, and the various contradictions within bourgeois society were unprecedentedly acute. The struggle of Russian workers was becoming increasingly revolutionary. Workers had progressed from economic strikes to political strikes, to political demonstrations. Under these circumstances, the establishment of a revolutionary Marxist party was clearly a top priority. But at this time, the main representative of Russian opportunism, the "Economists," believed that the most important thing for the working class was to organize economic struggles. They worshipped the spontaneity of the working-class movement and denied the leading role of the Party. After a fierce and principled struggle, Lenin defeated opportunism and, together with Stalin, laid the ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical foundation for a new type of party. Lenin's work "What Is to Be Done?" played a decisive role in the ideological training of the new type of working-class party. Cogniot emphasized that the arguments in Lenin's work are applicable today as they were in 1902.

French Communist Party Central Committee member Fajon published an article entitled "The Heroic Struggle of the Vietnamese, Khmer, and Lao Peoples Promotes the Cause of Peace." Fajon first described how the Indochinese people established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the war, established national governments in Cambodia and Laos, and carried out victorious struggles against the French aggressors. He then said: The Indochinese people have won great victories in recent years. By the beginning of 1952, 90 percent of Vietnamese territory was under democratic rule or controlled by the People's Army and guerrillas. Most of the territories of Cambodia and Laos have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism. The democratic governments enjoy great prestige. The people of the three countries are aware that they are part of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and are engaged in a heroic struggle, firmly believing that they will eventually defeat the foreign aggressors. Fajon emphasized that for many years, American imperialists have openly supported the French colonial aggressors in their intervention in Indochina. Millions of French people now realize that this "dirty war" is America's war; fighting to end this war has become a unanimous demand nationwide. There is no doubt that the united struggle waged by the people of France, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, as well as all peace fighters in all countries, will surely stop the aggression of American imperialism and its running dogs, end the war in Indochina, and force the troops of all imperialists to withdraw from this region.

This issue also published articles such as "The 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada (formerly the Workers' Party)" by Buck, General Secretary of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三六期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三六期已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“和平预算和战争预算”的社论说：三月八日苏联最高苏维埃所通过的关于一九五二年国家预算的法律，又一次极其鲜明地证实了苏联的外交政策是爱好和平的。苏联的预算是和平的预算，它显示了苏维埃多民族国家的威力不断增长，它的生产力迅速发展，它的有计划的、社会主义的经济日益加强。在苏联一九五二年预算中，预算收入是五千零九十九亿卢布，支出是四千七百六十九亿卢布，收入超过支出三百二十九亿卢布。预算的全部支出中有近三分之二用于发展国民经济和文化事业。在预算的收入中，人民的税收只占全部收入的百分之九点三。各人民民主国家的预算支出，绝大部分也是用在国民经济发展和社会文化措施上。但是，资本主义国家的预算与和平、民主和社会主义国家预算完全相反。它们是战争的预算。例如，即使按照官方的材料，美国的直接与间接的军事开支就占全部预算支出的百分之八十以上，法国占百分之五十，英国和意大利占百分之五十以上。但同时，诸如社会和文化需要的拨款，却被削减到微不足道的数目。社论最后强调说：从和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国的预算与资本主义国家的预算的比较中，各国人民可以清楚地知道谁是朋友、谁是敌人；谁在维护和平、谁在疯狂地准备战争。
    本期刊载了法国共产党中央委员谷尼欧的“革命的马克思主义政党思想基础的光辉著作”一文，纪念列宁名著“做什么？”刊行五十周年。谷尼欧说：自从列宁的著作“做什么？”问世以来，已经五十年了。列宁这部光辉著作的国际意义，实在是无法估量的。一切国家的共产党人，都倚靠着这部书里阐发的充满活力的列宁主义思想，在不倦地学习着，而且将来还要继续学习怎样建设和巩固共产党和工人党。谷尼欧接着分析了列宁这部名著所产生的时代背景，他指出：列宁的“做什么？”是一九○二年出版的。在十九世纪末期和二十世纪初期，资本主义已经发展到它的最高阶段——帝国主义阶段，资产阶级社会内部的各种矛盾空前尖锐化了。俄国工人的斗争愈来愈带有革命性质。工人们已经从经济罢工进到政治罢工，进到政治示威。在这种情况下，创立革命的马克思主义政党显然成了头等迫切的需要。但在这时，俄国机会主义主要代表“经济派”认为，工人阶级最重要的事情是组织经济斗争。他们崇拜工人阶级运动的自发性而否认党的领导作用。经过激烈的原则性的斗争之后，列宁打败了机会主义，并和斯大林共同奠定了一个新型政党的思想、组织、策略和理论基础。列宁的著作“做什么？”对于新型的工人阶级政党的思想锻炼，起了决定性的作用。谷尼欧强调说：列宁这部著作的论点，在一九○二年固然适用，但在今天也同样适用。
    法国共产党中央委员斐盖尔发表了题为“越南、高棉和寮国人民的英勇斗争促进了和平事业”的文章。斐盖尔首先叙述了印度支那人民在战后成立越南民主共和国，在高棉、寮国成立民族政府，并和法国侵略者进行胜利斗争的情形。他接着说：印度支那人民近年来已经赢得了伟大的胜利。到一九五二年初，越南领土已有百分之九十在民主政权之下，或被人民军与游击队所控制。高棉与寮国的大部分领土已经从帝国主义的枷锁下解放出来。民主政府享有巨大的威望。三国人民都意识到他们是以苏联为首的民主阵营的一部分，并且正在进行一场英勇的斗争，深信最后必能战胜外国侵略者。斐盖尔强调说：多年以来，美帝国主义者一直公然支持法国殖民主义侵略者对印度支那进行干涉。千百万法国人民现在都已认识到这场“肮脏的战争”是美国的战争；为结束这场战争而奋斗已成为全国一致的要求。毫无疑问，法国、越南、高棉和寮国人民，以及各国的一切和平战士所进行的联合一致的斗争，一定可以制止美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略，结束印度支那的战争，迫使一切帝国主义者的军队从这个地区撤退。
    本期还发表了加拿大劳工进步党（其前身为工人党）总书记布克的“加拿大工人党建党三十周年纪念”等文章。（新华社）
