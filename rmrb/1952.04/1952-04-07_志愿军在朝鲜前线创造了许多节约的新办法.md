    The Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean Front Create Many New Ways to Save

    Editor: While the people of the motherland are enthusiastically carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the conservation movement we launched on the Korean front is also in full swing. The soldiers have come up with many ways to overcome difficulties, and there are many new conservation innovations. Now, I will introduce them as follows: 1. "Reflector": When the soldiers are adding to the construction of fortifications, in order to save lamp oil, they use mirrors to reflect sunlight into the tunnels during the day to illuminate them; at night, they use pine branches and strips of torn rubber shoes to make lamps. 2. "Making Candles": The high machine gun company of a certain unit uses the wax paper that wraps bullets to boil the wax off the paper with hot water, then boils it down again, and pours it into a prepared mold to make good candles. Twenty-five sheets of wax paper can make two thirty-centimeter-long candles, each of which can burn for eight hours. 3. "Small Iron Forge and Foreign Bellows": As time goes on, with the construction of more fortifications, the small pickaxes become dull and difficult to use. Now, small iron forges have been installed on all positions. The soldiers save the charcoal they use for heating and use it for ironworking; they take out the gunpowder from the enemy's artillery shells that they have collected and use them as anvils for ironworking. In this way, the dull pickaxes can be sharpened and used again. Comrade Wang Yongzhang, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation returning to China and combat hero of our unit, also took one of these pickaxes to the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao as a gift to commemorate the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea. In order to save charcoal and improve work efficiency during ironworking, Chen Shankui, a squad leader of a certain unit, used artillery shell boxes to make bellows. In this way, the time to forge a pickaxe is reduced by three-quarters, and twenty-five can be forged in two hours. 4. "Small Charcoal Kiln": In order to save on heating costs and avoid freezing, all agencies and units of our department make their own charcoal.

    The people of the motherland call us the most beloved people. We love the motherland, love the people, and love the motherland's materials. These conservation methods are only the beginning of our efforts to practice thrift.

    志愿军在朝鲜前线创造了许多节约的新办法
    编辑同志：当祖国人民热烈地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动时，我们在朝鲜前线发动的节约运动也轰轰烈烈地展开了。战士们想出许多克服困难的办法，并且有很多节约的新创造。现在介绍如下：一、“反光镜”：战士们在加修工事时，为了节省灯油，白天利用镜子反光，把洞子里面照亮；晚间利用松树枝和割成条的破胶皮鞋点灯。二、“作洋蜡”：某部高机连，利用包子弹的蜡纸，用热水把纸上的蜡质煮下来，再经熬制，倒在制好的模型里，便成很好的蜡烛。用二十五张蜡纸，可以做三十公分长的蜡烛两支，每支可点八个钟头。三、“小铁匠炉和洋风箱”：日久天长，修工事多了，小镐便磨秃了，不好使用。现在各阵地上，普遍安了小铁匠炉。战士把自己烤火烧的炭节省下来，用来打铁；把拾回来的敌人的炮弹中的药掏出之后，做成打铁用的砧子。这样，把用秃了的镐，打出尖来再用。中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表、我部战斗英雄王永章同志，还给祖国人民和毛主席带了一个这样的镐去，作为抗美援朝纪念的献礼。打铁时为了节省木炭，提高工作效率，某部班长陈山奎同志，利用炮弹箱子改作风箱，这样一来，打镐时间快了四分之三，两个钟头可打二十五把。四、“小炭窑”：为了节约烤火费，又不受冻，我部各机关、部队都自己动手烧木炭。
    祖国人民称我们是最可爱的人，我们热爱祖国，热爱人民，热爱祖国的物资。这些节约的办法，只算是我们厉行节约的开始。
