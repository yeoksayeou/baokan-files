    It is Wrong to Take an Irresponsible Attitude Towards Handling Agency Production
    Editor: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government rented a private factory in Hangu Town last March for agency production. The factory director went to Tianjin last autumn and has not returned since. The entire factory is supported by several cadres who do not bear primary responsibility. On February 5th, the factory finally stopped producing sodium sulfide, and the production of caustic soda was also suspended for seven days. It was only with a loan from the Hangu Town People's Government that production could barely be maintained. The factory purchased more than 10,000 tons of saltpeter from private salt fields, but only 2,000 tons were transported due to lack of funds. This has affected salt production. The factory cannot pay back its loans to the bank, nor can it pay the workers' wages normally. In March, each worker only received 100,000 yuan. The workers feel unable to maintain their livelihoods. The workers call the leadership departments every day for instructions, but the only answer they get is: wait for processing.
    The Haixing Factory in Hangu Town is an agency production unit of the Tianjin Changlu Salt Bureau. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the factory had neither direction nor plan in production, and most of its funds remained in Tianjin. It is in danger of shutting down.
    We believe that the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Changlu Salt Bureau should be fully responsible for the agency production and the workers' lives. No agency can violate the "Decision on Unified Handling of Agency Production" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. They should quickly send personnel to inspect and deal with it.

### 对处理机关生产采取不负责任态度是不对的

    对处理机关生产采取不负责任态度是不对的
    编辑同志：天津市人民政府去年三月在汉沽镇租了某私营工厂作为机关生产。该厂厂长自去年秋天去天津后，至今没有回来，整个工厂全靠几个不负主要责任的干部支持。二月五日，该厂终于停止了硫化碱的生产，曹达部分的生产也曾停工七天。后经汉沽镇人民政府给予贷款，才能勉强维持生产。该厂曾向私营盐滩批购硝土一万多吨，因缺乏经费，只运进二千吨。这就影响了盐业生产。该厂对银行的借款无法支付，对职工的工资也不能正常支付，三月份每个职工只拿到十万元。职工都感到无法维持生活。工人们每天打电话向领导部门请示，所得的答复却只是：听候处理。
    汉沽镇海兴工厂是天津长芦盐务局的机关生产，
    “三反”运动后，该厂在生产上既无方向，又无计划，大部资金留在天津。即有停工的危险。
    我们认为天津市人民政府、长芦盐务局应对机关生产和工人生活负责到底。任何机关都不能违反政务院公布的“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”，他们应迅速派员检查处理。　邵振鹏　林兆祥
