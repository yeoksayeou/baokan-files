Farmers in Niuzhuang and Other Areas of Yanshi County, Henan Province Actively Repair Pools and Store Water to Fight Drought

Niuzhuang and Jijia Gou villages in the first district of Yanshi County, Henan Province, are cotton-producing areas in the Mangshan Mountains. Because these two villages lack water sources, the water used by farmers for drinking and other purposes is mostly stored rainwater in "tuns" (storage pits). This has caused many difficulties for farmers in this area in their lives and production. In order to solve this serious problem, these farmers, who have long suffered from water shortages, plan to build a large reservoir about 25 zhang in diameter and 1.5 zhang in water depth this year, under the leadership of the local township government. This small-scale water storage project started on February 7. The actions of farmers in this area to actively store water and fight drought are worthy of learning by other regions.

    河南偃师县牛庄等地农民
    积极修池蓄水抗旱
    河南省偃师县一区牛庄和吉家沟两个村，是邙山岭的棉产区。这两个村由于缺乏水源，农民吃和用的水绝大部分是靠储藏雨水的“屯子”。这样就给这一带农民在生活和生产上造成许多困难。这些常期经受缺水痛苦的农民，为了解决这一严重的问题，在当地乡政府领导下，计划在今年修一个直径二十五丈左右、容水高达一丈五尺的大蓄水池。这个小型蓄水工程已在二月七日开工。这一带农民积极蓄水抗旱的行动是值得各地学习的。　董虹
