    Writing to the Newspaper Should Be Serious and Earnest

    Editor: The People's Daily published my letter on February 27th regarding the Jin Xianghou Coal Mine manager concealing state property and evading taxes. This letter was written based on the report materials from Gao Jinxing, a corrupt element at the Jin Xianghou Coal Mine. Although I had conducted a preliminary investigation into this matter beforehand, knowing that Taxation Bureau cadre Shang Jiyuan was a corrupt element and that most of the tax evasion and cadre corruption at Jin Xianghou was true, I did not conduct a serious investigation into the "concealing property" aspect, and I lightly trusted the words of the corrupt element. Therefore, the entire report lost its authenticity. This is my responsibility. I will accept this lesson and be sure to conduct a comprehensive investigation before writing any manuscripts in the future, and write with a serious and earnest attitude.

    给报社写信要认真严肃
    编辑同志：人民日报二月二十七日刊载了我写的晋祥厚煤矿经理隐匿国家财产，逃避纳税一信。这封信，是我根据晋祥厚煤矿贪污分子高金星的检举材料写的。事先我虽对这件事作过初步调查，知道税务局干部商继远是个贪污分子，晋祥厚的偷漏税收、腐蚀干部的大部情况是真实的；但对于“隐匿财产”一项，我却没有认真调查，轻信了贪污分子的话，因此，使整个报道失掉了真实性。这是我应该负责的。我要接受这次教训，在今后写稿时一定先作全面的调查，以认真严肃的态度写稿。
