    The Creative Power of the Working Class
    The first coal cutter manufactured in our country has undergone two trials at the Datong Coal Mine. The test results were good. The coal cutter is an important machine in modern coal mining industry. The fact that the working class of our country can manufacture this relatively complex mining machinery that they could not manufacture in the past fully demonstrates the immeasurable wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working class. This is an important guarantee for the industrialization of our country. Due to the long-term aggression of imperialism in the past, the development of our industry is畸形的(distorted). Many machines or parts used in industrial production cannot be manufactured by ourselves and must rely on imports. Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the working class has given full play to its creativity, and many things that could not be manufactured by ourselves in the past can now be manufactured. However, many engineering and technical personnel, influenced by bourgeois ideology, do not believe in the great creative power of the Chinese working class. Some leading cadres cannot seriously criticize the incorrect views of these technical personnel and take effective measures to support and encourage various creations of the workers. When the Taiyuan Machine Factory manufactured coal cutters, some people believed that these self-made coal cutters might not be usable. When a coal mine heard that the Taiyuan Machine Factory had successfully manufactured coal cutters and requested to order them, the technical personnel of the relevant leading departments rejected the request, believing that it would be better to order from abroad. Some technical personnel even refuse to test our self-made products that have been successfully manufactured in their own factories and mines. They think that everything is good in the United States, doubt the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and do not believe in the power of the working class. They still look at the liberated working class with old eyes. The successful trial of the coal cutter is just one of the thousands of creative achievements of the Chinese working class. It is a good education for those who do not believe in the great creativity of the Chinese working class. Those who have this wrong view should thoroughly criticize their own wrong thinking, truly establish the mass viewpoint, believe in the power and wisdom of the masses, and learn from the masses with an open mind.

    工人阶级的创造力量
    我国制造的第一部截煤机已经在大同煤矿做了两次试验。试验结果良好。截煤机是现代采煤工业中的重要机械。我国工人阶级能够制造出这种比较复杂的过去所不能制造的矿山机械，这充分表现了中国工人阶级的不可限量的智慧和创造力。这就是我国工业化的一个重要保证。由于过去帝国主义的长期侵略，我们工业的发展是畸形的。许多工业生产中使用的机械或机件，我们自己都不能制造，而要依靠进口。解放以后，在中国共产党的正确领导和苏联先进经验的帮助下，工人阶级发挥了创造性，许多过去自己不能制造的东西，现在能够制造了。但是，许多工程技术人员因为受了资产阶级思想的影响，却不相信中国工人阶级的伟大的创造力量。有些领导干部也不能认真地批判技术人员的这种不正确的观点，并采取有效的措施支持和鼓励工人的各种创造。当太原机器厂制造出来截煤机时，就有一些人认为这些自制的截煤机不一定能够使用。有一个煤矿，在听到太原机器厂制造截煤机成功而要求定货时，有关的领导部门的技术人员竟给挡了回去，他们认为还是到国外定货为好。有些技术人员甚至拒绝在自己所在的厂、矿中试验我们自制成功的产品。他们认为一切都是美国的好，怀疑苏联的先进经验，更不相信工人阶级的力量。他们还是拿旧的眼光来看解放了的工人阶级。截煤机的试验成功，只不过是中国工人阶级千百项创造性的成就中的一件。它对于那些不相信中国工人阶级的伟大的创造力的人们，是一个很好的教育。有这种错误观点的人们，应该彻底地批判自己的错误思想，真正树立起群众观点，相信群众的力量和智慧，虚心地向群众学习。
