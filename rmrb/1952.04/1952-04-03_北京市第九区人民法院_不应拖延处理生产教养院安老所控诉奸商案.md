    To the Editor: After the launch of the "Three-Anti" campaign, we discovered that the private Tian Shun Qing Flour Mill in Beijing and Li Han Chao, a cadre in our institution (a grafter), colluded to sell over 10,800 catties of millet and 7,830 catties of corn flour that was intended to be food for the people in our institution. After repeated negotiations, Tian Shun Qing Flour Mill promised to return the grain owed by the end of February. Fearing that the private merchants would be cunning and break their promise, we inquired again on February 25th. Tian Shun Qing Flour Mill's reply was still: "We guarantee to return it by the end of February." However, by March 1st, we still had not seen Tian Shun Qing Flour Mill return the grain. When we went to urge them again, the unscrupulous merchants at Tian Shun Qing Flour Mill shamelessly prevaricated, saying: "We cannot give it to you now; we will return it on March 15th."
    The people in our institution urgently need this grain for consumption, so on March 1st, we filed a lawsuit with the Ninth District People's Court of Beijing and requested urgent handling. At that time, Comrade Xue, the person in charge of the Ninth District Court, said: "Because you are waiting for the grain, this case must be handled in advance." Since filing the lawsuit on March 1st, we have inquired three times. On March 8th, the Ninth District People's Court summoned both parties. After being questioned about some circumstances, we waited for a decision. Later, we inquired again by telephone. On March 13th, the court summoned us for the second time. This time, Comrade Xue of the court replied: "The Ninth District Court cannot be responsible for judging this case; it must be transferred to the Municipal People's Court." At that time, we asked how long it would take to transfer this case. Comrade Xue's reply was: "In the past, we delayed the time because we were investigating whether this case was related to the 'Three-Anti' campaign. This time, transferring it to the Municipal Court will quickly resolve it." But now it has been more than ten days. In the meantime, we have inquired six or seven times, but the case still has no results. Every time we inquire, Comrade Xue of the Ninth District Court says: "The draft has been submitted, but it has not yet been approved, so it cannot be transferred. It may be approved today." On March 24th, when we inquired again, Comrade Xue replied like this: "You can write an official letter and file a lawsuit with the Municipal People's Court yourself." On the same day, we wrote an official letter to the Municipal People's Court according to the instructions of the Ninth District People's Court. However, the Municipal People's Court returned the original letter, saying: "Since this case is already with the Ninth District People's Court, we cannot accept it. It should still be resolved by the Ninth District People's Court."
    Now, our problem has not yet been resolved. We believe that the Ninth District People's Court should quickly change its bureaucratic attitude of not caring about the interests of the masses and delaying action, and quickly transfer our case to resolve our problem.

### 北京市第九区人民法院  不应拖延处理生产教养院安老所控诉奸商案

    北京市第九区人民法院
    不应拖延处理生产教养院安老所控诉奸商案
    编辑同志：“三反”运动开展后，我们发觉北京市私营天顺庆磨房和我所干部李汉超（贪污分子）勾结，变卖了我所人员的口粮小米一万零八百多斤、玉米面七千八百三十多斤。经我们再三提出交涉后，天顺庆磨房答应二月底把欠粮还清。我们惟恐私商狡猾不守信用，在二月二十五日，又追问一次。天顺庆磨房的答复还是：“保证二月底还清。”但到三月一日，我们仍未见天顺庆磨房还粮，再去催要时，天顺庆磨房奸商竟耍无赖，推拖说：“现在不能给，三月十五日再还。”
    我所人员急待食用这些粮食，所以我们在三月一日到北京市第九区人民法院起诉，并请求急速处理。当时九区法院负责人薛同志说：“因为你们等用粮，这个案件要提前办理。”从三月一日起诉后，我所曾经三次催问，到三月八日，九区人民法院才传讯双方。被讯问了一些情况后，我们又等待处理。后来，我所又用电话催问。到三月十三日，法院第二次传讯。这次，法院薛同志答复说：“这个案件九区法院不能负责判决，须转经市人民法院。”当时我们曾问，这一案件需多久才能转递。薛同志的回答是：“过去因为了解这个案件是否有关‘三反’，所以拖延了时间。这次转市法院，很快就可获得解决。”但到现在已经十多天，中间我们又催问六、七次，此案仍然没有结果。我们每次催问时，九区法院薛同志就说：“稿底已交上去，但尚未批下来，所以不能转。今天可能批回来。”三月二十四日，我们再催问，薛同志却这样回答：“你们可以写公函，自己向市人民法院起诉。”当日，我们依照九区人民法院的指示，写公函到市人民法院。但市人民法院却把原信退回说：“此案既已经九区人民法院，我们不能受理。仍应由九区人民法院转递解决。”
    现在，我们的问题还没有解决。我们认为第九区人民法院应该迅速改变这种不关心群众利益、拖延应付的官僚主义态度，迅速转递我们的案件，解决我们的问题。
