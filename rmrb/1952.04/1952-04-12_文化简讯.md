Cultural Briefs

　　▲The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League's school for ethnic minorities officially opened on the fifth of this month. The purpose of establishing the class is to cultivate cadres for the Youth League from ethnic minorities. The study period is tentatively set for two years. The eighty-one students participating in the study come from all over the country, including outstanding Youth League members and cadres from seventeen ethnic minorities, including Uyghur, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Miao, Yi, Yao, Li, and Blang. The content of the study is: in the initial half-year, students who do not understand Chinese will learn Chinese and Chinese writing, while other students will study basic political knowledge, modern history, language, current events, and systematic League courses.

　　▲In order to meet the needs of a large number of developing secondary schools, Jilin Province promoted 123 outstanding primary school teachers to middle school teachers last semester (accounting for 11% of the province's middle school teachers), partially solving the problem of insufficient middle school teachers. In addition, the province currently has 269 primary school teachers studying at normal schools and junior colleges, who will soon graduate and take on the teaching work of junior high schools and the lower grades of junior normal schools.

　　The experience of Jilin Province proves that planned training and promotion of primary school teachers to serve as middle school teachers is one of the practical and feasible methods to solve the current shortage of middle school teachers. The province has used this method to solve the problem of middle school teachers last semester; furthermore, due to the establishment of normal schools and junior colleges, more than half of the newly added teachers for junior normal schools and junior middle schools this year have a reliable source. The main experiences of the province in carrying out this work are: 1. First of all, it is necessary to eliminate various ideological obstacles and overcome the conservative views and departmentalism of educational administrative departments at all levels. 2. It is necessary to firmly grasp the principle of considering both moral character and talent, and not simply emphasize political conditions while ignoring the cultural and professional level that middle school teachers must possess; nor can we overemphasize professional level while ignoring political conditions and moral character. 3. Primary school teachers are often unfamiliar with teaching ideas, teaching materials, teaching methods, and the characteristics of teaching objects when they are promoted or transferred to middle school teachers, so it is best to provide them with short-term training before promotion or transfer to lay a preliminary foundation for their future work. After taking up work in middle schools, the school leadership should still pay close attention to education and give specific help.

　　▲In order to provide learning materials for cadres, the People's Publishing House has begun to compile and print "Loose-Leaf Selections." All laws, instructions, reports, theses, and important domestic and international current affairs documents and reference materials that can be used as political current affairs learning materials for cadres are compiled and printed in loose-leaf form. Twelve kinds of "Loose-Leaf Selections" have been published, and more will be selected and printed successively.

    ▲中国新民主主义青年团中央团校少数民族班，已于本月五日正式开学。该班开办的目的是培养少数民族青年团的干部，学习时间暂定为两年。参加学习的八十一个学员来自全国各地，包括维吾尔、回、藏、蒙、苗、彝、瑶、黎、半里等十七个少数民族的优秀的青年团员和团的干部。学习的内容是：在最初半年内，不懂汉语的学员是学习汉语、汉文，其他学员则学习政治常识、近百年史、语文、时事和系统团课。
    ▲为了适应大量发展中等学校的需要，吉林省在去年下学期将一百二十三名优秀小学教师提升为中学教员（占该省中学教员的百分之十一），部分地解决了中学师资不足的问题。此外，该省现已有二百六十九名小学教员进师范专科学校学习，不久即将出校担任初中和初级师范低年级的教学工作。
    吉林省的经验证明：有计划地培养、提升小学教师担任中学教师，是解决目前中学师资不足的切实可行的办法之一。该省已用这种办法解决了去年下学期的中学师资问题；更由于成立了师范专科学校，今年新增加的初级师范和初级中学的教员，半数以上已有了可靠的来源。该省进行此项工作的主要经验是：一、首先必须清除各种思想障碍，克服各级教育行政部门的保守观点和本位主义。二、必须切实掌握德、才兼顾的原则，不能单纯强调政治条件、忽视中学教师必须具备一定的文化和业务水平；也不能过分强调业务水平而忽视政治条件和道德品质。三、小学教师提升或调任中学教师时，往往对教学思想、教材、教法以及教学对象的特点都比较生疏，因而最好在提升或调任之前加以短期训练，为他们今后工作打下初步基础。到中学担任工作后，学校领导方面仍应抓紧教育，给以具体的帮助。
    ▲人民出版社为了供应干部学习资料，开始编印“活叶文选”。凡是可以作为干部政治时事学习材料的法令、指示、报告、论文及国内国际的重要时事文献、参考资料，都以活叶形式编印成册。“活叶文选”现已出版十二种，以后将陆续选印。
