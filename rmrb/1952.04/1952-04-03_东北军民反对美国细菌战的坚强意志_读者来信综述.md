    The Strong Will of the Northeastern Military and Civilians Against American Bacteriological Warfare – Summary of Readers' Letters

    Readers from various parts of Northeast China have written to this newspaper, reporting on the determination of the people of Northeast China to resolutely extinguish the poisonous flames of American bacteriological warfare.

    Reader Wang Qiang wrote: "I am a reader living on the forefront of national defense. I saw with my own eyes the insects with bacteria that the American invaders scattered. On March 3rd, an old lady surnamed Li said to me angrily: 'These American wolves couldn't bomb us to death, and now they want to harm us with bacteria. They've got another thing coming. With Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of anything.' This is our common will." Zhang Ruxiao, Hao Bingfu, and others from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Northeast China wrote: "The criminal acts of American imperialism in spreading bacteria have already extended to us. This has further aroused our hatred for American imperialism. We, along with the local men, women, old, and young, are all mobilized. We are fighting on the front line of the anti-bacteriological warfare. We have the confidence to smash all the enemy's conspiracies."

    All the staff of the Heishan County Health Institute in Liaoxi Province wrote: "We wish we could capture those who spread the bacteria alive right now. We are already prepared to stand on the front line of the anti-bacteriological warfare at any time." All the doctors of the Second Institute of the Suihua County Health Institute in Heilongjiang Province wrote: "We are turning our anger into strength. Now we have already taken action. In addition to doing our original medical work well, we are also waiting for the call of the motherland, ready to go to the front line of the anti-bacteriological warfare at any time." The Harbin Medical University Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote: "We, the patriotic youth of Harbin Medical University, absolutely cannot tolerate the brutal crimes of the American invaders in using bacteriological weapons. We have unanimously solemnly sworn: 'Resolutely obey the needs of the motherland and go to the front line of the anti-bacteriological warfare!' We believe that we will definitely defeat the rampant attacks of the American invaders."

    All the staff of the Fourth Factory of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration wrote: "The bacteriological warfare carried out by American imperialism cannot shake our fighting will in the slightest. We are determined to oppose bacteriological warfare with practical actions of production competition." Representatives of the farmers of Xinghua Village, Eleventh District, Zhenlai County, Heilongjiang Province, wrote: "In addition to doing a good job in epidemic prevention, we are determined to consolidate and improve mutual aid teams, ensure the realization of production increase plans, and strengthen the power of combat."

    All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Jilin Military Region of the Northeast Military Region and its affiliated units, all the armed cadres and militiamen of the province wrote: "In the face of these American invaders who are making a desperate struggle, we only have a stomach full of anger! We have the determination and confidence to eliminate the bacterial pests scattered by the American invaders. We must use all our strength to further consolidate the security of the rear and support the front, and vow to give the American invaders a devastating blow and send them into the grave they dug themselves." Zhang Qinghua and Cao Guoxian of the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote: "In order to protest against the American invaders' bacteriological warfare, model young workers, soldiers, medical workers, public security officers, students, as well as 'tiger-beating' models in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle, representatives of ethnic minorities and religious groups in Shenyang held a forum. The youth present unanimously denounced the monstrous crimes of the American bacteriological warfare criminals, and expressed their determination to fight on various work posts to extinguish the poisonous flames of American bacteriological warfare."
