    Reply Regarding the Drinking Water Issue for Residents of Mentougou Town
    Editor: We believe that the suggestion "Relevant Departments Should Immediately Solve the Drinking Water Problem for Residents of Mentougou Town," published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 20, is correct. We and the Mentougou Office of the Beijing Waterworks Company have studied this issue many times, but due to water source difficulties, it has not been resolved. Recently, we have again requested the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Waterworks Company to find ways to solve this problem, and specific measures are currently under study.

    关于门头沟镇居民的饮水问题的答复
    编辑同志：四月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的“有关方面应即解决门头沟镇居民的饮水问题”的建议，我们认为是正确的。我们和北京市自来水公司驻门头沟办事处对这一问题曾经作过多次研究，但因为水源困难，终于没有解决。最近，我们又请求北京市人民政府及北京市自来水公司设法解决这个问题，现正在研究具体办法。
