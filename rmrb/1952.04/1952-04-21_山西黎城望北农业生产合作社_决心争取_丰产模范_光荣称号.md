    Wangbei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng, Shanxi
    Determined to Strive for the Glorious Title of "Model of Abundant Harvest"
    Editor: After reading the order from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government rewarding models of abundant harvests and the first list of awardees for the 1951 agricultural abundant harvest models in the newspaper, all of our male and female cooperative members were very excited. We farmers only suffered in the old society; how could we have had the opportunity to receive awards for abundant harvests! We are willing to learn from the abundant harvest models and run our agricultural production cooperative even better. We decided that the entire cooperative will jointly buy two oxen and one mule; this year, we will universally implement careful and meticulous farming on our more than 160 mu of autumn land and over 100 mu of wheat stubble land. In order to increase the yield per unit area, we plan to apply more than 40 dan of fertilizer per mu and adopt new techniques and sow superior varieties. The average yield of all the autumn land in our cooperative last year was 125 jin, and this year we plan to increase it to 185 jin based on this. We also plan to select five mu of grain land and five mu of corn land as high-yield land. In addition to careful and meticulous farming, these lands will be fertilized twice as much, striving for a yield of 600 jin of grain per mu of grain land and 700 jin of corn per mu of corn land. In addition to being determined to run our agricultural production cooperative well, we will also motivate and help the ten mutual aid teams in the entire village to move towards a more consolidated and sound road. We are prepared to encourage each other and strive for the title of abundant harvest model this year.
    All Members of the Wangbei Agricultural Production Cooperative, Second District, Licheng, Shanxi

    山西黎城望北农业生产合作社
    决心争取“丰产模范”光荣称号
    编辑同志：在报纸上看到中央人民政府农业部奖励丰产模范的命令和一九五一年度农业丰产模范第一批受奖名单后，我们全体男女社员都感到非常兴奋。我们农民在旧社会里只有受苦受难，那有丰产得奖的机会！我们愿意向丰产模范们学习，把我们的农业生产合作社办得更好。我们决定全社合伙买耕牛两头，骡子一头；把今年一百六十多亩秋地和百多亩麦茬地普遍做到精耕细作。为了提高单位面积产量，我们准备每亩地上肥四十多?，并且采用新的技术和播种优良品种。我们社的全部秋地去年的平均产量是一百二十五斤，今年我们准备在这一基础上，提高到一百八十五斤。我们还准备选出五亩谷地和五亩玉茭地作为丰产地。这些地除精耕细作外，要加倍施肥，争取谷地每亩产谷六百斤，玉茭地每亩产玉茭七百斤。我们除了有决心把我们的农业生产合作社办好以外，我们还要带动和帮助全村十个互助组，走向更巩固和更健全的道路。我们准备和他们互相勉励，争取今年丰产模范的称号。
