Explanation of the Draft Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Corruption
Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council

Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

The Draft Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Corruption, after soliciting opinions from various parties and making revisions, has been approved by the 130th meeting of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. Now, I will report on the basis for formulating these regulations and the regulations themselves, and submit them to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval.

These regulations are formulated based on Article 18 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates severe punishment for corruption, and the facts and accumulated experience revealed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements.

The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, relying on the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the working class, are a great mass movement to cleanse the poisons left over from the old society. Recently, during this period, the broad masses of people across the country, in order to stop the illegal and disciplinary violations of corrupt elements, to stop the rampant attacks from illegal bourgeois elements, and to defend and implement the Common Program's line, have waged fierce struggles and achieved great victories. Apart from a small number of completely illegal and undisciplined major corrupt officials among state personnel and a small number of completely illegal major thieves in the business community, this struggle is still within the people's democratic united front, using mass movements and criticism and self-criticism to transform the bad work styles in society and among state personnel using the principles of the Common Program; it is a struggle of the broad masses who support the Common Program against illegal acts that violate the Common Program; it is a struggle of the vast number of state personnel's clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style against the bad work styles of a section of degenerate and corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic elements; it is a struggle of legally operating private industrial and commercial enterprises according to the Common Program and national laws against the illegal operating paths of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. In short, apart from the struggle against major corrupt officials and major thieves, this is a struggle between two work styles and two lines within the people's democratic united front. This is another mass social reform movement with great historical significance for our country after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

In this movement, people refer to corruption, waste, and bureaucracy as the "three evils"; and illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence are referred to as the "five poisons." The five poisons are the main forms of rampant attacks currently launched by illegal bourgeois elements against the state and the people, while the three evils are mainly the result of the rampant attacks by illegal bourgeois elements.

Of course, the three evils also have other historical origins, that is, they are still the poisons left over by all exploiters and reactionary rulers of the old society, and illegal bourgeois elements are the main social class base that currently inherits and supports these poisons.

Because we have been busy for the past three years suppressing and eliminating the remnant forces of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, busy resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and land reform, and busy with the restoration of economic and cultural undertakings and the development of various construction undertakings, we have not yet had time to systematically eliminate these poisons, and the thieves in the bourgeoisie and the corrupt elements among state personnel have precisely taken advantage of this gap, colluding with each other, acting in collusion, and recklessly developing their illegal acts.

But this does not mean that everyone in the bourgeoisie has committed crimes without distinction. In the past period, judging from the situation in major cities, among the total number of petty bourgeoisie (referring here to independent handicraft households and family business households that generally do not hire workers or employees, excluding peddlers) and the bourgeoisie, those who abide by the law account for about 10%; those who basically abide by the law but have minor illegal acts account for about 60%; those who are half-legal and half-illegal account for about 25%; and those who are seriously illegal and completely illegal account for about 5%, they are capitalists with great or complete speculative nature; and those whose speculative nature is the most rampant and the most malicious, account for about 1% of the total number of industrial and commercial households, and the number is not very large. This last group of people are the so-called major thieves, who are no longer our friends, but criminals, so, except for those who confess their crimes and show repentance and have meritorious service, they must be punished by law. In the above percentages, law-abiding households and basically law-abiding households account for about 70% of the total number of industrial and commercial enterprises, most of whom are petty bourgeoisie, but there are also many bourgeoisie, and some large industrialists and businessmen.

Under the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements and the erosion of the poisons left over from the old society, many corrupt elements among state personnel have emerged. The most serious and most malicious major corrupt elements are also a minority. These major corrupt elements are also no longer our comrades, but criminals who steal the wealth of the state and the people, so, except for those who confess their crimes and show repentance and have meritorious service, they must be removed from our ranks and punished by law.

When the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements had not yet begun, the corruption phenomenon existing among state personnel and the theft phenomenon existing in the business community were very serious. However, because our country has the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, the strong leadership backbone trained by Chairman Mao, and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, after Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government gave an order, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements immediately unfolded across the country, and the broad masses of working people, revolutionary intellectuals, and the vast number of actively working cadres quickly united together, responded to the call of the state, and finally, the washed-hands personnel and industrialists and businessmen also united with us, forming a great united front of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti", thus completely isolating the major corrupt elements in state organs and the major thieves in society, and they were severely hit and punished; the tendency of illegal bourgeois elements to go against the state and the people was effectively stopped and corrected. At the same time, the bourgeoisie itself, because of the leadership and supervision of the working class, and the struggle launched by its own law-abiding, progressive, and active parts against the illegal, backward, and negative parts, has received a universal education. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we can fully see that our country's people's democratic united front and people's democratic dictatorship have been greatly consolidated, the situation in both finance and economy has been greatly improved, and the old ideas of intellectuals that are unfavorable to the people's cause have also been transformed, or are being transformed.

Now, in order to punish corrupt elements and thieves separately, to consolidate the victories already gained in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and to continue to wage persistent struggles against all corruption and theft behaviors, it is absolutely necessary to formulate a law, and that is the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Corruption that we are discussing today.

Below, I will make some explanations on the draft regulations.

First of all, the basic principles adopted by these regulations.

In order to combine punishment with education, and combine suppression with leniency to achieve the purpose of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and eradicating evil thoroughly, we must implement Chairman Mao's instructions in handling corruption and theft cases: leniency in the past, strictness in the future, leniency for the majority, strictness for the minority, leniency for confession, strictness for resistance, and strictness for state personnel, leniency for non-state personnel (except for a small number of extremely heinous criminals). These principles were summarized by Chairman Mao from the practice of our great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Only by following these principles can we properly resolve the many complex problems exposed in the movement. Therefore, many articles of these regulations cannot but have great flexibility.

The so-called great flexibility means that, on the one hand, those with a small number of serious crimes and bad circumstances, those who resist the movement and die without repentance, and those who still have or re-commit corruption and theft crimes after this "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement will be severely or more severely punished; on the other hand, for those corrupt and theft elements who voluntarily confess before being discovered or reported, those who thoroughly confess and repent after being discovered and voluntarily hand over as much stolen money and goods as possible, as well as those with minor circumstances who occasionally stumble, or those with more serious circumstances but who have repented and performed meritorious service, we will adopt a policy of leniency, treatment, education, and transformation. In fact, we are now using two methods to eliminate corrupt elements and thieves: one method is to arrest them, sentence them to imprisonment, and forcibly transform them, and sentence a very small number of extremely heinous criminals to death; the other method is not to arrest or imprison them, or sentence them to labor service or control, or impose fines, or only give administrative sanctions, and implement education and transformation. The number of people dealt with by the first method is a minority, and the number of people dealt with by the second method is the majority. Transforming a corrupt element or a thief, so that he no longer corrupts or steals, is equivalent to eliminating a corrupt element or a thief. The circumstances of the crime and the attitude after the crime of corrupt and theft elements are different, so the treatment should naturally have distinctions of leniency, strictness, lightness, and severity. Only in this way can it be both serious and cautious. As for why state personnel should generally be stricter, the reason is very simple. State personnel are entrusted by the people, and are the leaders and servants of the people. The requirements of the state and the people for them should be strict, and must be strict, otherwise it will be impossible to truly run our country's various undertakings well.

Secondly, I will explain some specific issues in the regulations.

I. These regulations mainly focus on punishing corruption. However, because the crimes of corrupt elements are mostly related to the bribery or theft of thieves in the business community, the latter must be handled jointly and uniformly, and should also be handled uniformly. As for the methods of corruption and theft, they are of course different. On the corrupt element side: some directly embezzle or steal state property in various ways when handling public funds and public property; some fraudulently obtain or extract state property in the form of using public office for private gain; or extort other people's property; or accept bribes from illegal capitalists; or use other means of using public office for private gain to illegally seek profits, such as using their position to engage in smuggling, tax evasion, trafficking in drugs, or trafficking in other prohibited goods. On the side of the thieves in the business community: some embezzle and conceal enemy and puppet property or public property; some bribe state personnel, introduce bribes, or steal state economic intelligence to seek private gain; some embezzle, steal, or defraud state property when engaging in economic exchanges with the state; some evade national taxes; some speculate and seek advantages, damage public interests for personal gain, and seek illegal profits, such as reselling gold and silver, evading foreign exchange, disrupting prices and finance, etc. However, whether it is corrupt elements among state personnel or thieves in the business community, what they embezzle and steal is all the property of the state and the people, which has caused serious harm to the state and the people, and they should be punished in accordance with these regulations. Only in specific handling, except for a small number of extremely heinous criminals, non-state personnel should generally be punished more lightly.

II. These regulations will be used to investigate those who have committed the crimes of these regulations in the past. The time limit for the investigation should be calculated from the date of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that is, October 1, 1949. However, for those whose corruption or theft is serious, bad, or causes great public outrage, the investigation can be traced back to the date of the liberation of major cities and provincial capitals. In places liberated after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the investigation should be calculated from the date of liberation. Concealment and embezzlement of enemy and puppet property should be calculated from the date of the Japanese surrender; those with a small amount and no serious harm to the state may not be investigated.

III. In terms of the types of punishments in these regulations, the criminal punishments include labor service and control. These two types of punishments are suitable for those criminals who can be exempted from imprisonment but must be deprived of some or all of their political rights for a certain period of time and transformed. This is also a long-standing and effective method that has been implemented in the old liberated areas, and now we have fixed it in the articles.

For death penalty, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment, probation may be granted at discretion. Probation is mainly applicable to criminals who confess their crimes and show repentance or have meritorious service. Death penalty probation and life imprisonment probation must be carried out in imprisonment, examined in imprisonment and forced labor, and the execution of the original judgment or commutation of sentence at the expiration of the probation period shall be decided based on their performance during the probation period. Probation of fixed-term imprisonment may be granted without imprisonment during the probation period at discretion, and examined under control.

We have also written administrative sanctions such as dismissal, demotion, downgrade, demerit, and warning into the regulations. Because some corrupt elements need to be given administrative sanctions at discretion when exempted from criminal sanctions; for those who offer bribes with minor circumstances and who thoroughly confess, they must also be exempted from criminal punishment and given a warning sanction in the "Five-Anti" movement. This is a large number of commonly used methods in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, so it should be written into the regulations.

IV. Although our standard for sentencing is based on the amount of personal embezzlement, it is relative. The circumstances and severity of the crime, as well as the attitude of the perpetrator after the crime, are given sufficient attention in these regulations. For example, although the amount of personal embezzlement is the same, the severity of the harm to the state, social undertakings, and the people's safety caused by their criminal acts is different, that is, the destructive effect is different, so the sentence will be different. For example, one commits a general crime of corruption or theft, while the other commits the crime of accepting bribes and bending the law while enforcing the law; one commits a general crime of bribery, while the other commits the crime of extortion; one criminal confesses and performs meritorious service, while the other criminal dies without confessing and resists the movement; these latter should of course be sentenced severely or more severely. Therefore, there must be provisions for leniency and severity and mitigation and aggravation in the articles.

How should these provisions be applied in actual trials?

First of all, it should be like this. For example, in Article 3, Paragraph 3, there are three different punishments: the lightest is control, the heavier is labor service, and the heaviest is imprisonment. In each type of punishment, there are different lengths of sentence: the lighter is one to two years of control, labor service, or imprisonment, and the heavier can be sentenced to three to four years of labor service or three to five years of imprisonment. Based on the principles of leniency in the past and leniency for the majority, in this "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement, we will sentence more people who have committed the crime in this paragraph to control or labor service, and in the future, we will sentence more to labor service or imprisonment; for those who committed crimes in the past, the sentence will be shorter, and in the future, the sentence should be longer.

Secondly, it should be like this. Still taking Article 3, Paragraph 3 of these regulations as an example. If the sentence is reduced by one level, it should be punished according to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 4; if the sentence is increased by one level, it should be punished according to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 2. The rest can be deduced by analogy. If there are more than two reasons for lenient punishment, the sentence can be lenient and lenient again, to the point of being reduced by one level or several levels. For example: if the circumstances are originally minor, and the person is young and occasionally stumbles, and voluntarily confesses and repents, and reports and performs meritorious service, the sentence can be lenient again and again, and be reduced by one level or several levels. Conversely, if there are several reasons for severe punishment in Article 4 of these regulations, the sentence will be repeatedly severe, and become aggravated by one level or several levels.

V. These regulations also make provisions for the handling of criminal acts by non-state personnel. Because giving bribes to state personnel or introducing bribes is a bad criminal act, the sentence should be determined according to the severity of the circumstances and with reference to the provisions of Article 3 of these regulations. If the circumstances are particularly serious, part or all of their property may be confiscated. However, according to the principle of leniency for confession and strictness for resistance, those who thoroughly confess and report the bribe takers may be sentenced to a fine and exempted from other criminal sanctions. Also, according to the principle of leniency in the past and strictness in the future, those who have given state personnel small rebates in fair transactions before the promulgation of these regulations may not be considered as bribery; those who have given bribes with minor circumstances may also be exempted from fines and sentences, and only given a warning sanction; if they commit the crime again in the future, they will be dealt with severely.

When dealing with illegal industrial and commercial households, not only should leniency be given in the past and strictness in the future, leniency for the majority and strictness for the minority, leniency for confession and strictness for resistance, but also leniency for industry and strictness for commerce, leniency for ordinary commerce and strictness for speculative commerce. Also, because a systematic "Five-Anti" struggle like the current one has not been carried out among them in the past, and our purpose is to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, we have adopted a particularly lenient principle for the past illegal acts of the vast majority of them in this "Five-Anti" movement, and only punish the two types of seriously illegal households and completely illegal households, which account for about 5% of all industrial and commercial households. Among them, the distinction is made again according to the circumstances, and in fact, only industrial and commercial households that are completely illegal and refuse to confess will be given criminal sanctions with reference to the provisions of Article 3 of these regulations. If, after the "Five-Anti" movement and such lenient treatment, they commit the crimes of these regulations again, they should be severely punished.

VI. All embezzled property or other illegal income should be confiscated or recovered. However, in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, according to the principles of leniency in the past and leniency for the majority, those who embezzle less than one million yuan and have minor circumstances and voluntarily confess, and those who are basically law-abiding households with illegal income of less than two million yuan, are exempted from recovery. In addition, they should be confiscated or recovered as much as possible. If it is impossible to confiscate or recover, the trial organ or the deliberative organ may consult with the competent organ to give other appropriate dispositions at discretion. Industrial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood should be given appropriate consideration according to the principle of leniency for industry. However, whether it is industry or commerce, those who are able to make up for the refund and refuse to make up for the refund should be severely punished.

As for the scope of confiscation of property, it should be limited to the property directly and indirectly operated or owned by the offender himself. If the enterprise operated is a joint-stock company, the property of other shareholders in the joint-stock company should be handled according to the circumstances and the degree to which other shareholders are involved in the crime. If the offender's family has no other source of income, the property that can maintain the life of the family should be left to the family when the confiscation is carried out.

VII. In order to ensure that the broad masses of people can fully exert their supervisory role, these regulations not only guarantee their full right to report corrupt and theft elements; but also stipulate that those who implement打击 (dǎ jī) and retaliate against the reporters, as well as state personnel who deliberately shield or fail to report the corruption of their staff, will be given criminal sanctions or administrative sanctions at discretion according to the severity of the circumstances.

VIII. Those who have committed the crimes of these regulations in the past should be punished according to the general provisions of each article of these regulations. Those who still commit or recommit the crimes of these regulations after the promulgation of these regulations should generally be severely or more severely punished according to the provisions of each article of these regulations (Article 17); those who have committed the crimes of these regulations in the past and concealed them in this "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement will be regarded as crimes committed after the promulgation of these regulations when they are discovered in the future.

That is my report. Please review whether it is appropriate.

    关于中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例草案的说明
    中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会副主任  彭真主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例草案，经过多次征求各方面的意见并作了修改，已由中央人民政府政务院第一三○次政务会议通过。现在我把制定这个条例的根据和这个条例本身作如下的报告，提请中央人民政府委员会审查批准。
    这个条例，是根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十八条严惩贪污的规定和“三反”、“五反”运动中所揭露的事实和所蓄积的经验而制定的。
    “三反”和“五反”运动，是依靠广大人民群众，在毛主席、中央人民政府和工人阶级领导下，为着清洗旧社会遗留下来的污毒的一次伟大的群众运动。最近这一时期，全国广大人民群众为了制止贪污分子的违法乱纪，制止来自不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻，捍卫和贯彻执行共同纲领的路线，进行了激烈的斗争，得到了伟大的胜利。除了对于国家工作人员中一部分完全违法乱纪的大贪污犯和工商界中一部分完全违法的大盗窃犯以外，这种斗争仍是人民民主统一战线内部，采取群众运动和批评自我批评的方式，用共同纲领的原则改造社会上和国家工作人员中的坏作风的斗争；是拥护共同纲领的广大群众对于违反共同纲领的不法行为的斗争；是广大国家工作人员的廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风对于一部分堕落腐化的贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子的恶劣作风的斗争；是按照共同纲领和国家法令进行合法的私人工商业经营道路对于行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报的违法经营道路的斗争。简单讲，除了对大贪污犯和大盗窃犯的斗争以外，这是人民民主统一战线内部两种作风和两条路线之间的斗争。这是我们的国家在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的三大运动之后，又一次具有伟大历史意义的群众性的社会改革运动。
    在这次运动中，人们把贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象简称为“三害”；把行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报等违法行为简称为“五毒”。五毒是不法资产阶级分子目前向国家和人民举行猖狂进攻的主要形式，而三害在目前则主要是由于不法资产阶级分子猖狂进攻所引起的结果。
    当然，三害也还有其他的历史来源，就是说它还是旧社会一切剥削者和反动统治者遗留下来的污毒，而不法资产阶级分子则是目前承袭并且支持这些污毒的主要的社会阶级基础。
    由于我们三年来忙于镇压和消灭美蒋匪帮的残余势力，忙于抗美援朝和土地改革，忙于经济、文化事业的恢复和各项建设事业的发展，对于这些污毒还没有来得及加以系统的扫除，而资产阶级中的盗窃分子和国家工作人员中的贪污分子则恰是利用了我们这一个空隙，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，放肆地发展了他们的犯法行为。
    但这并不是说，资产阶级中的一切人都在毫无差别地犯了法。在过去这一时期，就各大城市的情况来看，小资产阶级（这里指的是一般不雇工人店员的独立手工业户和家庭商业户，不包括摊贩）和资产阶级的总数中，守法的约占百分之十左右；基本守法但有轻微违法行为的约占百分之六十左右；半守法半违法的约占百分之二十五左右；严重违法的和完全违法的，约占百分之五左右，他们是带有很大投机性的或完全投机的资本家；而其投机性最猖狂最恶劣的，约占工商户总数百分之一左右，数目还不算很大。这最后一部分人就是所谓大盗窃分子，已经不是我们的朋友，而是罪犯，因此，除坦白悔改并有立功表现者外，必须予以法律制裁。上述比例数中，守法户和基本守法户占工商界总数的百分之七十左右，其中的大多数是小资产阶级分子，但也有不少资产阶级分子，并且有一些大工商业者。
    在不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻之下，在旧社会遗留下来的污毒的侵蚀之下，就产生了国家工作人员中的许多贪污分子。其中最严重最恶劣的大贪污分子也是少数。这些大贪污分子也已经不是我们的同志，而是盗窃国家和人民财富的罪犯，因此，除坦白悔改并有立功表现者外，必须从我们的队伍中清除出去，并予以法律制裁。
    当“三反”和“五反”运动尚未开始的时候，在国家工作人员中所存在的贪污现象和工商界中所存在的盗窃现象是很严重的。但是，由于我们的国家有共产党和工人阶级的领导，有毛主席所教导的久经锻炼的坚强的领导骨干，有广大人民群众的热烈支持，所以毛主席和中央人民政府一声号令之后，“三反”和“五反”运动就立即在全国展开，广大劳动人民，革命知识分子，和广大积极工作干部迅速团结在一起，响应国家的号召，最后还有洗了手的工作人员和工商业者也和我们团结起来，组成了“三反”和“五反”的伟大的统一战线，这样就使国家机关中的大贪污分子和社会上的大盗窃分子完全陷于孤立，受到严厉的打击和制裁；不法资产阶级分子与国家人民背道而驰的倾向，得到了有效的制止和纠正。同时，资产阶级自身，因为有工人阶级的领导和监督，有自己内部守法的、进步的、积极的部分，对于违法的、落后的、消极的部分所开展的斗争，因而得到了一次普遍的教育。经过“三反”和“五反”运动，我们已经完全可以看出，我国的人民民主统一战线和人民民主专政是极大地巩固了，财政和经济两方面的情况是极大地改善了，知识分子的不利于人民事业的旧思想也获得改造了，或者正在改造中。
    现在为了对贪污分子和盗窃分子分别予以惩治，为了巩固“三反”和“五反”运动已得的胜利，并继续和一切贪污与盗窃行为进行坚持不懈的斗争，制定一个法律就是完全必要的了，这就是今天要讨论的中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例。
    以下我就本条例草案来作若干说明。
    首先是这个条例所采取的一些基本原则。
    为了把惩办与教育相结合、把镇压与宽大相结合以达到惩前毖后和除恶务尽的目的，我们在处理贪污、盗窃案件时，必须贯彻执行毛主席所指示的过去从宽、今后从严，多数从宽、少数从严，坦白从宽、抗拒从严和对国家工作人员从严、对非国家工作人员（除一小部分罪大恶极者外）从宽的原则。这几条原则，是毛主席从我们伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动的实践中所集中起来的。只有按照这样的原则，才能妥善地解决在运动中所暴露出来的许多复杂问题，因此，本条例的许多条文就不能不带着很大的伸缩性。
    所谓很大的伸缩性，就是说，一方面，对于少数罪行严重情节恶劣的分子，抗拒运动死不悔改的分子和在这次“三反”“五反”运动后仍有或再犯贪污、盗窃罪行的分子从重或加重惩治；另一方面，对于贪污、盗窃分子中，那些在未被发觉或未被检举前即自动坦白的分子，被发觉后彻底坦白悔改并自动地尽可能缴出赃款赃物的分子，以及情节轻微偶尔失足的分子，或情节虽较严重但已悔改立功的分子，采取宽大处理和教育改造的方针。实际上，我们现在是用两种方法来消灭贪污分子和盗窃分子：一种方法是把他们捉起来，判处监禁，强迫改造，对于极少数罪大恶极分子则判处死刑；另一种方法是不捉不关，或判处劳役、管制，或判处罚金，或仅予行政处分，实行教育改造。用第一种方法处理的是少数，用第二种方法处理的是多数。改造了一个贪污分子或盗窃分子，使他不再贪污、不再盗窃，就等于消灭了一个贪污分子或盗窃分子。贪污、盗窃分子犯罪的情节和犯罪后的态度，既各有不同，处理自当有宽、严、轻、重的区别。只有这样处理，才既是严肃的，又是谨慎的。至于为什么对于国家工作人员一般地要严些，理由是很简单的。国家工作人员是受了人民的委托的，是人民的领导者和勤务员，国家和人民对于他们的要求应该从严，也必须从严，不然就不可能把我们国家的各项事业真正办好。
    其次，我再就条例中的若干具体问题加以解释。
    一、这个条例是以惩治贪污为主。但因为贪污分子的罪行多半与工商界盗窃分子的行贿或盗窃行为有关，因此，对于后者就不得不连带地统一地加以处理，同时也应该统一地加以处理。至于贪污、盗窃的方式，当然各有不同。在贪污分子方面：有的是在经手公款、公物时，以各种方式直接侵吞或盗窃国家的财物；有的是以假公济私的方式，骗取或套取国家的财物；或者强索他人财物；或者收受不法资本家的贿赂；或者用其他假公济私的手段违法取利，例如利用职务上的便利，走私，偷税，贩运毒品，或贩运其他违禁品。在工商界的盗窃分子方面：有的是侵吞隐匿敌伪财产或公产；有的是向国家工作人员行使贿赂，介绍贿赂，或盗窃国家经济情报，谋取私利；有的是在和国家从事经济往来时，从中侵吞、盗窃、骗取国家财物；有的是偷漏国税；有的是投机取巧，损公利己，牟取非法利得，例如倒卖金银，逃汇套汇，扰乱物价金融等。但不论国家工作人员中的贪污分子或工商界的盗窃分子，他们所贪污、资窃的通通是国家和人民的财物，同样都给了国家和人民以严重的危害，都应该依照本条例，予以惩治。只不过在具体处理时，除一小部分罪大恶极者外，对于非国家工作人员一般地应该惩治得轻一些。
    二、这个条例，对于过去犯本条例之罪的，是要加以追究的。追究的时限，应自中华人民共和国成立之日，即一九四九年十月一日算起。但对其中贪污或窃盗情节严重恶劣或民愤甚大者，可追查到各地大城市和省城解放之日。在中华人民共和国成立以后解放的地方，应自解放之日算起。隐匿侵吞敌伪财产，应自日本投降之日算起；其中数量不大，并对国家无严重危害作用者，可以不予追究。
    三、这个条例在处分的种类方面，在刑事处分中，规定了劳役和管制的处分。这两种处分对于那些可以不判徒刑，但须剥夺一定时期的一部或全部政治权利并加以改造的罪犯，是适合的。这也是过去在老解放区久已实行有效的办法，现在我们用条文把它固定了起来。
    对于死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑，均得酌情予以缓刑。缓刑主要是适用于坦白悔改或有立功表现的犯人。死刑缓刑和无期徒刑缓刑均须实行监禁，在监禁和强制劳动中加以考察，并根据其在缓刑期间的表现，决定执行原判或于缓刑期满时予以减刑改判。有期徒刑的缓刑，可以酌情在缓刑期内不予监禁，而在管制中加以考察。
    我们把开除、撤职、降职、降级、记过和警告等行政处分，也写在条例中。因为有些贪污分子在免予刑事处分时，需要酌情予以行政处分；对于情节轻微而又彻底坦白的行贿分子，在“五反”中也须免刑而予以警告处分。在“三反”和“五反”运动中这是大量普遍采用的办法，因此应该把它写在条例中。
    四、我们量刑的标准，虽然规定以个人贪污所得的数额为根据，但这是相对的。对于犯罪的情节和恶劣程度以及犯人在犯罪后的态度，在本条例中，是给予了足够重视的。例如，个人贪污所得的数额虽然相同，但因其犯罪行为对于国家和社会事业及人民安全的危害程度不同，即所起破坏作用不同，因之判刑也就有轻重之别。又例如，一个是犯了一般的贪污罪或盗窃罪，另一个则是在执法时犯了贪赃枉法罪；一个是犯了一般的受贿罪，另一个则是犯了敲诈勒索罪；一个犯罪者既坦白又立功，另一个犯罪者则死不坦白，抗拒运动；对于这些后者，当然应该从重或加重处刑。因此，在条文中，也就不能不有从轻从重和减轻加重的规定。
    这些规定，在实际进行审判时怎样运用呢？
    首先应该是这样。例如，在第三条第三款中，有三种不同的处罚：最轻的是管制，较重的是劳役，最重的是徒刑。而在每一刑种中，又各有刑期长短之不同，轻的是一年至二年的管制、劳役或徒刑，重的可以判三年至四年的劳役或三年至五年的徒刑。根据对过去从宽、对多数从宽的原则，在这次“三反”“五反”运动中，我们对于犯了本款罪的人，会较多地判以管制或劳役，在将来则会较多地判以劳役或徒刑；对于过去犯罪的人，会判刑较短，将来则应该判刑较长。
    其次应该是这样。仍以本条例第三条第三款为例。如减轻一级，即应按照第三条第四款的规定去处罚；如加重一级，即应按照第三条第二款的规定去处罚。其余准此类推。如果有两条以上从轻处分的理由，可以从轻又从轻，以至减轻一级或几级处理。例如：本来情节轻微，又系年岁较轻、偶尔失足，又系自动坦白悔改，又系检举立功者，就可以一再从轻，并被减轻一级或几级论处。反之，有本条例第四条几款以上从重处罚的理由者，就会由一再从重，变为加重一级或几级论处。
    五、本条例中对于非国家工作人员的犯罪行为的处理，也做了规定。因为向国家工作人员行使贿赂或介绍贿赂，是一种恶劣的犯罪行为，应按其情节轻重参酌本条例第三条的规定去处刑。情节特别严重者，并得没收其财产的一部或全部。但是根据坦白从宽、抗拒从严的原则，其彻底坦白并对受贿人实行检举者，得判处罚金，免予其他刑事处分。又根据过去从宽、今后从严的原则，对于在本条例公布前，曾在公平交易中给予国家工作人员以小额回扣者可不以行贿论；对于行贿情节轻微者，也可免处罚金和判刑，而只给以警告处分；以后再犯则从重处理。
    在处理违法工商户时，不仅要对过去从宽、今后从严，多数从宽、少数从严，坦白从宽、抗拒从严，而且要对工业从宽、商业从严，普通商业从宽、投机商业从严。又因为过去在他们中间还没有开展过像现在这样有系统的“五反”斗争，而我们的目的是要惩前毖后，所以在这次“五反”运动中，对于他们的绝大多数在过去的违法行为，采取了特别从宽处理的原则，仅仅处罚严重违法户和完全违法户两类，他们约占全体工商户百分之五左右。其中又依情节再加以区别，实际上只对于完全违法而又拒不坦白的工商户，才会参照本条例第三条的规定酌予刑事处分。如果经过了“五反”运动和这样的宽大处理之后，再有犯本条例之罪的，那就应该从重惩治了。
    六、所有贪污财物或其他违法所得，应予以没收或追缴。但在“三反”“五反”运动中根据过去从宽、多数从宽的原则，对于贪污在百万元以下而又情节轻微、自动坦白者，对于基本守法户违法所得在二百万元以下的部分，均免予追缴。此外，则均应尽可能予以没收或追缴。如无法没收或追缴时，得由审判机关或议处机关商同主管机关酌情予以其他的适当处置。对于有益国计民生的工业，应按工业从宽的原则，给以适当照顾。但是无论工业或商业，凡力能补退缴纳而拒不补退缴纳者，均应从重惩治。
    至于没收财产的范围，应限于犯罪者本身直接和间接经营的或所有的财产。其经营的企业，如系合股公司，应按其情节和其他股东对犯罪行为与闻的程度，处理其他股东在该合股公司的财产。如犯罪者家属无其他生活来源，应在执行没收时，留给其家属以能够维持生活的财产。
    七、为了保证广大人民群众能够充分发挥其监督的作用，在本条例中，不但保证了他们对贪污、盗窃分子有充分的检举权利；并且规定：凡对检举人施行打击、报复的人们，以及对于所属工作人员的贪污行为故意包庇或不予举发的国家工作人员，按其情节轻重，酌予刑事处分或行政处分。
    八、对于过去犯本条例之罪的人，应按本条例各条的一般规定论处。对于在本条例公布后仍犯或再犯本条例之罪的人，一般应按本条例各条规定，从重或加重惩治（第十七条）；过去犯本条例之罪，在此次“三反”、“五反”运动中隐瞒不交代者，以后被发觉时，以本条例公布后犯罪论。
    我的报告就是这样。是否有当，请予审查。
