    We Met the Heroes Fighting on the Kham-Tibet Plateau
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Representative Pei Guang
    In the cave dwellings built against the mountains and the barracks made of pine branches, we met the comrades of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, whom the volunteers on the Korean front were constantly thinking about. They were very healthy, each comrade having a dark red, round face, and wearing sheepskin clothing. They warmly welcomed our visit. Division Commander Zhang Zhong told me, "The troops have been waiting for you for three days." The welcome slogans they posted had been blown away by the wind four or five times. When welcoming us, many comrades took off their winter clothes and twisted the Yangko dance and performed 快板 [a type of rhythmic talking] in the cold wind, wearing only thin clothing. We were filled with fraternal enthusiasm for each other.

    This heroic unit received the task of "opening up Mount Que'er" last October, which was an arduous project. In the severe cold of minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius, on a mountain with two meters of snow and an altitude of 5,300 meters, they fought against stubborn rocks for 43 days and finally split the eighty-li Mount Que'er. The snow collapsed the tents, and the soldiers' hands, feet, and lips were chapped and bleeding, and the tools stuck to their hands, but they were not afraid. The soldiers said, "If we don't take Mount Que'er, the heroes won't come down the mountain." When excavating frozen soil, they baked it with fire and dug with iron picks. At the beginning, they could only complete three or four tenths of the original task per day, but they were not discouraged. The comrades said, "The stone can't be harder than my will!" They said, "Stubborn rock is like Truman; every hammer blow lands on Truman." Encouraged by such patriotic political slogans, soldier Zhou Zhenkai hit eight hundred hammer blows in one breath. When filling earthworks, the soldiers used flatbed carts to work on rugged paths. They proposed, "People rest, but the carts don't." Some comrades had swollen shoulders, but they still gritted their teeth and worked. The climate on Mount Que'er changes rapidly. Hail, heavy snow, and strong winds often attacked them, but not a single comrade put down their tools. They kept their raincoats, bowls, and study books by their side. Apart from rest, they ate, worked, and studied on the construction site. With unparalleled perseverance and wisdom, the heroes created the "pulling method," "collapsing method," and "triangular drilling method," once blasting down 736 cubic meters of solid rock, which even the engineers considered an unprecedented miracle. Later, their construction efficiency greatly exceeded the original plan. The Ninth Company of a certain regiment even created an over-fulfillment efficiency of 340 percent.

    Here is a song they sang when they opened up Mount Que'er. Let me read it:
    "Speaking of Mount Que'er, few people have lived there since ancient times, even birds find it difficult to reach the top, and snow never stops all year round.
    “………………………………”
    "The People's Liberation Army, every one is a hero, sets up camp at the foot of Mount Que'er, determined to open up the mountain.
    “……………………………………………
    "Tents are set up on the hillside, sleeping in the clouds and mist, branches are spread on the snowy ground, like steel wire beds.
    "Get up early and go to work late, hot blood blocks the cold wind, no water to drink, melt snow to eat, cooking is fragrant.
    "The mountain is high and the slope is steep, there is no place to stand for work, the rope is tied around the waist, and blasting holes are made in the air.
    "Explosives are exploding all over the mountain, and rubble is flying everywhere, even the iron mountain will be split in half! It must be opened even if it is not passable."
    What a difficult struggle, what heroic spirit! Only the people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party can have such a spirit of hard work and heroism. I was incomparably encouraged and educated by the heroic deeds of the comrades.

    They not only overcame difficulties and completed their work tasks, but also cherished materials everywhere. Last year, one division alone saved 150,000 jin of grain. Adding the surplus from production and reclamation, the entire division saved more than 1.4 billion yuan in RMB last year. One company, in order to save explosives, organized the entire company to use manpower to pull the rocks protruding on the mountain. They tied the rocks with ropes and pulled, and then used iron rods to pry them. Everyone shouted, "Come on! Drag Truman into the sea!" In this way, they pulled down 500 cubic meters of rock blocking the road, saving 50 jin of explosives. Another battalion organized the strength of two companies and used the same method to pull down 110,000 kilograms of stones at one time, saving four days of work. A squad leader named Yang Shuyuan hollowed out the foundation of the earthworks and used collapse to excavate the soil. One day of his work could replace two days of transportation for the entire squad.

    When we talked with the comrades of the troops stationed in Ganzi, Yulong, and Tibet, every comrade's answer to us showed unparalleled firm confidence. They said, "Please tell all the comrades of the Volunteer Army not to have any worries. We are determined to support you by consolidating the southwest defense of the motherland." They said, "Our current task is construction, and our enemy is nature. Every inch of land has been stained with our blood and sweat. We must cherish it and take good care of it. We must build the Kham-Tibet Plateau of the motherland into the second Siberia!"

### 我们会见了战斗在康藏高原上的英雄们

    我们会见了战斗在康藏高原上的英雄们
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　裴光
    在依山修筑的窑洞和用松枝扎成的营房里，我们会见了朝鲜前线的志愿军无时无刻不在怀念着的人民解放军进藏部队的同志们。他们的身体非常健壮，每个同志都是黑红圆胖的脸。穿着羊皮衣服。我们的访问受到了他们的热烈欢迎，师长张忠同志对我说：“部队在三天前就等着你们了。”他们贴的欢迎标语已经被大风刮掉了四五次。在欢迎我们时，许多同志脱掉冬衣，穿着单薄的衣服在冷风中扭秧歌、说快板。我们相互之间充满了友爱的热情。
    这支英雄部队，在去年十月接受了“打通雀儿山”的任务，这是一个艰巨的工程。他们在零下三、四十度的严寒中，在积雪两公尺、拔海五千三百公尺的大山上和顽石斗争了四十三天，终于把上下八十里的雀儿山劈开了。大雪把帐篷压塌了，战士们的手脚和嘴唇冻裂出血，工具黏住了手，但是，他们不怕。战士们说：“不拿下雀儿山，英雄不下山。”在开掘冻土时，他们一面用火烤，一面用铁镐挖。开始，一天只能完成原订任务的十分之三、四，但是他们并不灰心。同志们说：“石头再硬也硬不过我的意志！”他们说：“顽石好比杜鲁门；锤锤打在杜鲁门身上。”在这样的爱国主义的政治口号的鼓励下，战士周振凯一口气打了八百锤。在填土方时，战士们用平板车在崎岖的小路上工作。他们提出：“人休息车不休息。”有的同志肩膀压肿了，还是咬着牙干。雀儿山上的气候变化很快。冰雹、大雪、大风经常袭击他们，但是没有一个同志放下工具。他们把雨衣、饭碗、学习本放在身边，除了休息之外，吃饭、工作、学习都在工地上。英雄们以无比坚强的毅力和智慧，创造了“拉方法”、“塌方法”、“三角打眼法”，曾一次炸下坚石七百三十六立方，使工程师们都认为这是从未见过的奇迹。后来，他们的施工效率大大超过了原订计划。某团九连更创造了百分之三百四十的超工效率。
    这里有他们在打通雀儿山时的一首歌。让我念下去：
    “提起雀儿山，自古少人烟，飞鸟也难上山顶，终年雪不断。
    “………………………………”
    “人民解放军，个个是英雄，雀儿山下扎下营，要把山打通。
    “……………………………………………
    “山坡架帐篷，睡在云雾中，树枝铺在雪地上，好像钢丝床。
    “早起晚下工，热血挡冷风，没有水喝化雪吃，煮饭香喷喷。
    “山高坡又陡，作工没处站，绳子拴在腰中间，悬空打炮眼。
    “满山炸药响，碎石四下崩，铁山也要劈两半！不通也要通。”
    这是多么艰苦的斗争，多么英雄的气魄啊！只有共产党领导下的人民军队，才能有如此坚苦卓绝的精神和英雄气概。我从同志们的英雄事迹中，受到了无可比拟的鼓舞和教育。
    他们不但克服困难，完成了工作任务，而且处处爱惜物资。去年，仅一个师就节约了粮食十五万斤，加上生产开荒的节余，全师去年一年中节约了十四亿多元人民币。有一个连队，为了节省炸药，他们组织全连力量，用人力去拉凸出在山上的石块。他们用绳子拴着石头拉，再用铁棍撬。大家喊着“加油啊！把杜鲁门拖下海！”就这样，他们把挡在路上的五百方岩石拉掉了，节省了五十斤炸药。还有一个营组织了两个连的力量，用同样的办法，一次拉下十一万公斤的石头，节约了四天工作时间。有一个班长叫杨树源，把土方根基挖空，利用塌方来挖土，他一个人一天的工作，可以叫全班搬运两天。
    我们在甘孜、玉隆和进藏部队同志交谈的时候，每个同志回答我们的话，都表现了无比坚定的信心。他们说：“请告诉志愿军的全体同志们，不要有后顾之忧，我们坚决以巩固祖国西南国防来支援你们。”他们说：“我们目前的任务就是建设，我们的敌人就是自然界。每一寸土地上，都流了我们的鲜血和汗水，我们要珍惜它，爱护它。我们要把祖国的康藏高原建设成为第二西伯利亚！”
