The Key to Peace and War
——My Understanding of Stalin's Reply to American Press Inquiries
Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs

Recently, a group of editors from American local newspapers submitted four questions concerning the current international situation to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Stalin, requesting a reply. Stalin answered these questions on March 31st.

My overall understanding of Stalin's replies to these questions is this: as long as the American imperialists do not peddle war, and as long as the American imperialists sincerely want peace, then war can be eliminated, and peace can be maintained. Because in today's world, only the American imperialists want war and do not want peace; everyone else wants peace and does not want war. We, the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, have been continuously making various efforts for years to safeguard peace, oppose aggression, and oppose war. This is a fact that the whole world has witnessed and heard. If the American imperialists could abandon their policy of aggression, peace could have been maintained, and a third world war could have been avoided.

Now let me talk about my understanding of Stalin's replies to the American press inquiries.

First, the American newspaper editors asked: Is a third world war closer now than it was two or three years ago? Stalin's reply was: No, it is not.

Why "is it not"? This is not because the American imperialists have relaxed their war plans; on the contrary, they have intensified their war plans. This is entirely because the strength of peace-loving people all over the world is growing, making it increasingly difficult for American imperialists to launch a war. To give an example, the astonishing victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the Korean War has played a great role in teaching the American imperialists a lesson and has had a great deterrent or delaying force on their attempt to launch a third world war.

Second, the American newspaper editors asked: Would a meeting of the heads of major powers be beneficial? Stalin replied: It might be beneficial.

Why say "it might be beneficial"? I think this depends on whether the heads of the United States and its vassal states have the sincerity to solve the current important international problems, and the important manifestation of sincerity is whether the United States is willing to abandon its policy of aggression. If the United States is willing to abandon and can abandon its policy of aggression, then holding a meeting will be beneficial; otherwise, it will not be beneficial. It all depends on the intentions and plans of the American imperialists.

Third, the American newspaper editors asked: Do you think now is an appropriate time to unify Germany? Stalin's reply was: Yes, I think it is.

Originally, the German people had long demanded unification, and the government of the German Democratic Republic, representing the will of the German people, had repeatedly asked the Adenauer "government," the puppet organization of the United States, for unification and appealed for unification. The Soviet Union had also long approved of German unification and notified the American, British, and French ruling groups of this intention. The main country that does not approve of German unification is only the United States. Now the people of West Germany are further demanding unification. If the United States also approves, or at least does not hinder it, then German unification would be a very easy thing.

Fourth, the American newspaper editors asked: On what basis is the coexistence of capitalism and communism possible? Stalin replied: Peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism is entirely possible if there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed.

Stalin's reply is clear enough and needs no further explanation. However, one point should be pointed out here, and that is: "Peaceful coexistence" includes the meaning of "peaceful competition." We have no doubt about the outcome of peaceful competition; the result is that communism will win, and capitalism will lose. Human common sense, the interests of the broad masses of the people, the direction indicated by the entire history of social development, and the fighting spirit of the proletariat all point to this inevitable result. We have absolute confidence in the final victory, so we are not afraid of competition, and we are not afraid of coexistence. It is the capitalists and imperialists who are afraid of competition and afraid of coexistence, not us.

Although the American newspaper editors raised four questions, in essence, there is only one question, and that is: how can peace be maintained, and how can war be avoided? The answer of our peace-loving people has always been: if the American imperialists can abandon their policy of aggression, abandon their war conspiracies, abandon their ambition to dominate the world, and abandon their plans to enslave the people of the world, peace can be maintained, and war can be avoided.

    和平与战争的关键
    ——我对于斯大林答复美国报界询问的理解
    中国人民外交学会会长  张奚若
    最近有一批美国地方报纸的编辑向苏联部长会议主席斯大林提出了关于目前国际形势的四个问题，请求答复，斯大林在三月三十一日答复了这些问题。
    我对斯大林对于这些问题的答复有一个总括的理解，那就是：只要美帝国主义者不贩卖战争，只要美帝国主义者诚心要和平，那战争就可以消灭，和平就可以保持。因为今日全世界上只有美帝国主义者要战争，不要和平；别人都是要和平，不要战争的。我们以苏联为首的和平阵营，数年以来，早已在不断地作各种努力，要保卫和平，反对侵略，反对战争。这是全世界有目共睹、有耳共闻的事实。美帝国主义者如能放弃侵略政策，和平本来是可以保持的，第三次世界大战本来是无从发生的。
    现在让我说说我对于斯大林答复美国报界询问的理解。
    第一、美国报纸编辑们问：第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？斯大林的答复是：不，不是这样。
    为什么“不是这样”呢？这并不是因为美帝国主义者放松了他们的战争计划；相反地，他们加紧了他们的战争计划。这完全是因为全世界上爱好和平的人民的力量日益壮大起来，使美帝国主义者发动战争的困难越来越大了。举一个例子来说，中朝人民在朝鲜战争中的惊人的胜利，对于美帝国主义者是起了很大的教训作用的，对于他们发动第三次世界大战的企图，是有着很大的遏止或推迟力量的。
    第二、美国报纸编辑们问：各大国首脑举行一次会谈有益处吗？斯大林答复说：可能会有益处。
    为什么说“可能会有益处”呢？我以为这是要看美国和它的附庸国的首脑们有无诚意解决当前国际间的重要问题，而有无诚意的重要表现，就是美国是否肯放弃它的侵略政策。若是美国肯放弃、能放弃它的侵略政策，那举行一次会谈便会有益处；不然，便不会有益处。这全看美帝国主义者的意向如何，打算如何。
    第三、美国报纸编辑们问：你认为现在是统一德国的适当时机吗？斯大林的答复是：是的，我认为是这样。
    本来德国人民早已要求统一，代表德国人民意志的德意志民主共和国政府已经数次向美国的傀儡组织阿登纳“政府”要求统一，呼吁统一。苏联也早已赞成德国统一，并将这个意思通知了美、英、法统治集团。不赞成德国统一的，主要的只有美国。现在西德人民又进一步地要求统一了。若是美国也赞成，至少不阻碍，那德国统一本是很容易的事。
    第四、美国报纸编辑们问：在什么基础上资本主义与共产主义的共存才是可能的？斯大林答复说：如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。
    斯大林的答复已够明白，不需要再多说。不过这里有一点似应指出，那就是：“和平共存”包含着“和平竞赛”的意思。我们对于和平竞赛的结果是丝毫不怀疑的，这个结果是：共产主义必胜，资本主义必败。人类的常识，广大人民的利益，整个社会发展史所指示的方向和无产阶级的奋斗精神，都指向这个必然的结果。我们对于最后的胜利有绝对的信心，所以我们不怕竞赛，不怕共存。怕竞赛、怕共存的是资本主义者和帝国主义者，不是我们。
    美国报纸编辑们虽然提出了四个问题，实质上只是一个问题，那就是：和平如何可保，战争如何可免？我们向来爱好和平的人民的回答是：美帝国主义者如能放弃他们的侵略政策，放弃他们的战争阴谋，放弃他们称霸世界的野心，放弃他们奴役世界人民的计划，和平就可以保，战争就可以免。
