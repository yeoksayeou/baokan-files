Economic Briefs

    ▲ After liberation, the minority nationalities in Sanjiang County, Guangxi Province, have seen preliminary improvements in their lives and a gradual increase in their political awareness. Six or seven districts in the county have organized supply and marketing cooperatives, and farmers in various districts are actively joining. The Dong compatriots in the Eighth District are the most enthusiastic, with over 13,000 shares in the various cooperatives throughout the district. Everyone cherishes their cooperative. An old farmer from Huangtu Village said, "Chairman Mao is very concerned about the minority nationalities. He not only helps us set up schools but also helps us organize cooperatives. Chairman Mao loves us, and we should love Chairman Mao even more."
    ▲ Shaanxi Province has completed the advance procurement of improved wheat varieties ahead of schedule. The 2.4 billion yuan special fund for improved wheat varieties has now been allocated to the counties planting improved wheat varieties, and it is estimated that 24,000 dan can be pre-purchased by April 24. The purpose of purchasing improved varieties is to promote them, and the purpose of advance purchase is to help farmers solve the difficulties of lacking means of production or food rations during spring plowing.
    ▲ As the mold season approaches, state-owned specialized companies in Chongqing are beginning to inspect warehouses and take inventory to prevent spoilage of goods. Last year, state-owned specialized companies in Chongqing did not pay enough attention to mold prevention, which resulted in heavy losses of materials. During the "Three-Anti" movement this year, such waste and the bureaucratic work style of the leadership were exposed and severely criticized, so the companies have paid timely attention to mold prevention.
    ▲ Fujian is a famous fruit-producing area. This spring, the vast number of farmers in the province actively responded to the government's call to greatly increase the planting of fruit trees. According to statistics, more than 20 counties, including Minhou, Zhangpu, Longxi, and Putian, have increased the planting of more than 320,000 citrus and honey peach fruit trees. In addition, farmers in various places have also planted a large number of sandalwood olives and Xiamen pomelos.
    In order to support farmers in cultivating fruit trees and increasing production, the Fujian Branch of the People's Bank of China issued 850 million yuan in loans for fruit seedlings and fertilizers last year. Last year, the Fujian Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry also established fruit tree horticulture farms and guidance stations in major fruit-producing areas. On the one hand, it ran training classes for fruit farmers and organized technical research meetings to help farmers improve their fruit tree cultivation techniques. On the other hand, it cultivated a large number of fruit seedlings to supply to farmers for expanding planting.

    ▲广西省三江县少数民族，解放后生活已得到初步改善，政治觉悟也逐步提高，全县已有六、七个区组织了供销合作社，各区农民纷纷入社；其中以第八区侗族同胞最为踊跃，全区各合作社已有一万三千多股。大家都很爱护自己的合作社。黄土村一位老农民说：“毛主席对少数民族同胞很关怀，不但替我们办学校，还帮我们组织了合作社；毛主席爱我们，我们更要爱毛主席。”
    ▲陕西省已提前办理小麦良种预购工作。二十四亿元小麦良种专款现已拨到种植良种小麦的各县，预计四月二十四日前可预购二万四千石。收购良种是为了推广，预购是为了帮助农民解决在春耕生产中缺少生产资料或口粮的困难。
    ▲重庆市各国营专业公司因时令进入霉季，正开始检查仓库，清点存货，以防止物资霉烂。去年重庆市各国营专业公司未及时重视防霉工作，曾使物资遭受了很重的损失。今年在“三反”运动中，这种浪费现象和领导方面的官僚主义作风都受到揭露和严厉的批判，各公司因而及时注意了防霉工作。
    ▲福建是著名的水果产区，今春该省广大农民积极响应政府号召大量增植果树。据统计，闽侯、漳浦、龙溪、莆田等二十多个县增植的柑桔和水蜜桃等果树达三十二万多株，另外各地农民还栽种了大批的檀香橄榄和厦门文旦等果树。
    为扶助农民栽培果树增加生产，人民银行福建省分行在去年就发放了八亿五千万元的果苗贷款和果肥贷款。福建省人民政府农林厅去年并在主要水果产区设立了果树园艺场和指导站，一面开办果农训练班和组织技术研究会，帮助农民提高栽培果树的技术，一面大量培育果苗，供应农民扩大种植。
