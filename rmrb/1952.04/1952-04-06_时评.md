    (I) The Struggle Against Germ Warfare Will Surely Be Victorious
    ——Congratulations on the Closing of the Oslo Meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council
    The Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council successfully closed on April 1st. The meeting focused on the issue of the American aggressors' germ warfare in Korea and our country, and unanimously adopted a letter "Against Germ Warfare" addressed to men and women worldwide, calling on people around the world to rise up in unity to stop the heinous crime of germ warfare by US imperialism. It also requested the participation of the most prestigious representatives from the scientific, legal, and religious communities to form an authoritative and impartial international committee to collect all the facts and expose the crimes of the American aggressors to the world. The Chinese people, standing at the forefront of the opposition to germ warfare, warmly support the call of this meeting and are determined to fight to the end with peace-loving people around the world to stop the American aggressors' germ warfare.
    The large-scale germ warfare conducted by the American aggressors not only threatens the lives and safety of the Chinese people but also threatens the lives and safety of people all over the world; it not only violates all international laws but also violates the conscience of mankind. Therefore, every conscientious person in the world, regardless of their nationality, political views, or religious beliefs, will rise up enthusiastically in response to the call of the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, take resolute action to crush the American imperialists' plot to destroy humanity. In fact, from the first day the American aggressors launched germ warfare, angry voices against germ warfare have erupted from all over the world. It is conceivable that, under the call of the World Peace Council, people all over the world will launch a broader and more vigorous movement against germ warfare, further expanding the ranks of those defending world peace, and build a strong and unbreakable Great Wall of defense of world peace on a global scale. All the desperate conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors will be shattered in the face of this Great Wall!
    Today, the American aggressors are still frantically continuing to spread germs and are still shamelessly denying their heinous crimes. The likes of Acheson and Ridgway imagine that by playing such tricks, they can deceive the kind people of the world. But this is a foolish fantasy. Peace-loving and righteous people all over the world will unite more closely to break through the American murderers' shameless denials and repel the American robbers' attack on humanity! Peace-loving American people will also never listen to the deceptive lies of the warmongers. For the sake of their children and families, and for their own vital interests, they will act together to oppose this inhuman atrocity by the American ruling clique.
    People all over the world who love peace, stand under the banner of defending world peace and fight against the germ warfare of the American aggressors! This struggle will surely achieve final victory!
    (II) International Economic Conference and World Peace
    The International Economic Conference opened in Moscow on April 3rd. There are economists, entrepreneurs, engineers, trade union and cooperative leaders, economic magazine and newspaper editors, and other representatives and guests from forty-two countries. Although they hold various different political views, their desire to improve the international economic situation is the same. They will jointly seek ways to promote economic cooperation between countries, especially between countries with different economic systems. Businessmen and industrial organizations from various countries attending the meeting can also conduct commercial transactions during the meeting and establish future mutual contacts.
    Friendly economic cooperation among countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is a concrete step in defending world peace. Because, trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, exchanging what one has for what one needs, can not only promote the economic development of countries and improve people's living conditions, but also promote friendship among the people of various countries.
    Today, friendly and mutually beneficial international trade has developed unprecedentedly between the Soviet Union and the various people's democratic countries. However, in capitalist countries, especially in the international trade relations between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, an extremely abnormal state has been created due to the US imperialists' policy of arms expansion and war preparation and the implementation of monopolies and embargoes. American monopoly capitalists have forced capitalist countries to sever economic and trade relations with the Soviet Union, our country, and the people's democratic countries, and have manipulated the United Nations to pass illegal resolutions on "embargoing" our country.
    The American warmongers attempt to use embargoes to hinder the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union, our country, and the people's democratic countries, in order to achieve their aggressive goals; however, these conspiracies and tricks of theirs are all in vain. From the Elbe River to the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, the territories of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries occupy more than half of the two continents of Europe and Asia. Here there is the most fertile land on earth, the most powerful industry and agriculture, and eight hundred million hardworking, brave, and united people. They are planning to produce everything they need, and news of production development, price reductions, and rapid increases in people's economic lives is constantly coming from every country.
    US imperialism's obstruction of trade relations between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union, our country, and the people's democratic countries is a terrible attack on the people's lives in capitalist countries. Factories in Western Europe have needlessly lost their old customers in Eastern Europe; the food-deficient British cannot obtain abundant grain from the Soviet Union, and must cross the Atlantic to buy expensive flour in the United States, which will increase the burden on each family by many each year. Japanese people could originally buy coking coal and soybeans from China nearby, but the Americans do not allow them to buy them, and require them to transport them from the United States at two or three times the price. This situation makes the lives of the vast number of people in capitalist countries even more impoverished and miserable. This situation cannot but arouse strong opposition from the people of various countries. The reactionary policy of US imperialism is harming the people of capitalist countries.
    The improvement of international trade relations will undoubtedly help to improve the living conditions of the people of various countries, and will also enhance the friendship between the people of various countries, thereby benefiting the world's people in defending world peace and eliminating the threat of a new imperialist war.

    （一）反对细菌战的斗争必将获得胜利
    ——祝世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议闭幕
    世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议已于四月一日胜利闭幕了。会议着重地讨论了关于美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的问题，并一致通过了题为“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，号召全世界人民一致奋起，制止美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并请科学界、法律界和宗教界最有威望的代表参加，组成一个权威的和公正的国际委员会收集一切事实，使美国侵略者的罪行大白于天下。站在反对细菌战的最前线的中国人民，热烈拥护这次会议的号召，并决心和全世界爱好和平人民一道，为制止美国侵略者的细菌战而奋斗到底。
    美国侵略者大规模地进行细菌战，不仅威胁了中国人民的生命和安全，而且威胁了全世界人民的生命和安全；不仅违反了一切国际公法，而且违反了人类的良心。因此，全世界每一个有良心的人，不论他是那一国人，抱着怎样的政治见解和宗教信仰，都将激昂地起来响应世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议的号召，采取坚决的行动，粉碎美帝国主义这个毁灭人类的阴谋。事实上，从美国侵略者发动细菌战的第一天起，反对细菌战的愤怒的声音就从全世界爆发出来了。可以想到：在世界和平理事会的号召下，全世界人民必将更广泛、更猛烈地展开反对细菌战的运动，更加扩大保卫世界和平的战斗队伍，在全世界范围内筑成一座强大的牢不可破的保卫世界和平的长城。美国侵略者的一切穷凶极恶的阴谋诡计，必将在这座长城面前碰得粉碎！
    今天，美国侵略者还在疯狂地继续撒布细菌，还在无耻地抵赖他们的滔天罪行。艾奇逊、李奇微之流自以为这样玩玩魔术，便可以把全世界善良的人民蒙蔽住了。但这是愚蠢的妄想。全世界爱好和平正义的人民，必将更紧密地团结起来，击破美国杀人犯的无耻抵赖，并击退美国强盗向人类的进攻！爱好和平的美国人民，也决不会听信战争贩子们的欺骗谎言。他们将为了自己的孩子和家庭，为了自己切身的利益，一致行动起来，反对美国统治集团这种灭绝人性的暴行。
    全世界爱好和平的人民，站到保卫世界和平的旗帜下来，为反对美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争！这个斗争必将获得最后的胜利！
    （二）国际经济会议与世界和平
    四月三日，国际经济会议已在莫斯科开会了。这儿有来自四十二个国家的经济学家、企业家、工程师、工会和合作社领袖、经济杂志和报纸编辑及其他代表和来宾。他们虽然抱有各种不同的政治见解，但是希望改善国际间的经济情况的愿望是相同的。他们将共同寻求促进各国之间，特别是实行着不同经济制度的国家之间经济合作的方法。与会的工商业家和各国的工商业组织，还可以在会议期间进行商业交易，并建立今后的相互联系。
    各国人民在平等互利的基础上进行友好的经济合作，是保卫世界和平的具体步骤。因为，在平等互利的基础上进行贸易，互通有无，不独能促进各国经济的发展，改善人民的生活条件，而且能促进各国人民之间的友谊。
    今天，在苏联和各人民民主国家之间，友好互助的国际贸易已经有了空前的发展。可是在资本主义各国，特别是资本主义各国与苏联和各人民民主国家之间的国际贸易关系，却因美帝国主义的扩军备战政策和实行垄断、禁运而造成了极不正常的状态。美国垄断资本家强迫资本主义各国和苏联、各人民民主国家之间断绝经济贸易关系，并操纵联合国通过了对我国“禁运”的非法决议。
    美国战争贩子们企图用禁运来阻碍苏联、我国和人民民主国家的和平建设，达到它的侵略目的；可是，它的这些阴谋诡计，都是枉费心机。从易北河到太平洋的西岸，苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的国土，占欧亚两个大陆的一大半。这儿有地球上最富饶的土地，有最强大的工业和农业，有八亿勤劳勇敢而又团结一致的人民，他们有计划地生产着他们所需要的一切，每一个国家都不断地传来生产发展、物价降低和人民经济生活迅速上升的消息。
    美帝国主义阻碍资本主义世界各国对苏联、我国和人民民主国家间的贸易关系，对于资本主义各国的人民生活来说，却是一种可怕的进攻。西欧的工厂，白白失掉了东欧的老主顾；缺粮食的英国人，不能得到苏联丰富的粮食，而要横跨大西洋到美国去买高价的面粉，这会使每个家庭每年增加许多负担。日本人本来可以就近购买中国的焦煤和大豆，可是美国人不许他们来买，而要他们拿两三倍的价钱到美国去运。这种情形，使资本主义各国广大人民的生活更加穷困，更加悲惨。这种情况不能不引起各国人民的强烈反对。美帝国主义的反动政策，正害了资本主义国家的人民。
    国际贸易关系的改进，无疑地会有助于改善各国人民的生活条件，而且也将增进各国人民之间的友谊，从而有利于世界人民保卫世界和平，消除帝国主义新战争的威胁。
