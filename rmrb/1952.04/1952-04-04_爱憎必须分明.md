Love and Hate Must Be Clear
    Qiu Sheng
    In a certain organization, there was a particularly stubborn embezzler. His wife, a Communist Party member, reported him under pressure from the masses. It is said that before she reported her embezzling husband, she had proposed to the Party leader the "condition" of leniently treating her husband after the report. At a general meeting held in the organization, she went on stage and first said to her embezzling husband: "I am reporting you in order to save you, to save our children..." The implication was: You were originally going to be severely punished, but in order to prevent "our" children from losing their father, I am reporting you.
    Regarding this, some comrades said: She and he are husband and wife, of course, they cannot completely sever their love, and we cannot demand too much of her. This statement is obviously wrong.
    What does a Communist Party member love? He loves the Party, and loves the people. What does he hate? He hates acts that harm the Party and harm the interests of the people – all enemies of the Party and the people. What is his standpoint? It is the standpoint of the working class, which is also the standpoint of the Party. For the benefit of the working class, personal interests, even precious life, can be sacrificed at any time. Reporting the crimes of others (no matter who) is a Communist Party member's most basic duty to struggle for the interests of the Party.
    A Communist Party member's love should and must be based on a common will to strive for a better future for the working class, on practical actions of mutual encouragement and mutual assistance to work hard for the interests of the Party, and on mutual supervision and safeguarding the interests of the Party. Our Party's policy towards embezzlers is now: those who voluntarily and thoroughly confess will be treated leniently, and those who refuse to confess and are reported by others will be severely punished. Therefore, when an embezzler has become stubborn to the point of becoming a traitor to the Party and the people, he must be reported without hesitation, and severe punishment must be demanded. A Communist Party member should never be like this embezzler's "lover," expressing love for the Party while also loving the Party's traitor. How is this possible! We must not allow any "personal feelings" to infiltrate the noble thoughts and feelings of a Communist Party member, thereby mitigating and diluting the struggle against all bad elements!

    爱憎必须分明
    秋生
    某机关有一个贪污分子，顽固之极。他的爱人是个共产党员，在群众的压力下，检举了他。据说，她检举贪污犯丈夫之前，曾经对党的领导者提出检举后宽大处理她丈夫的“条件”。在机关举行的一个大会上，她到台上首先对贪污犯丈夫说：“我检举你，是为了挽救你，挽救我们的孩子……”意思是说：本来你是要受严厉制裁的，为了使“我们的”孩子不致失去父亲，我来检举你。
    对此，有些同志说：她和他是夫妇关系，当然不能完全割断爱情，对她不能要求过高。这种说法，显然是错误的。
    一个共产党员，他爱什么呢？爱党，爱人民。他恨什么呢？恨危害党、危害人民利益的行为——一切党和人民的敌人。他的立场是什么呢？是工人阶级立场，也就是党的立场。为了工人阶级的利益，可以随时牺牲个人的利益甚至宝贵的生命。检举别人（不管什么人）的罪行，这是一个共产党员为党的利益而斗争的最起码的义务。
    一个共产党员的爱情，是应该而且必须建立在为工人阶级的美好将来而奋斗的共同意志上，建立在互相鼓励、互相帮助为党的利益而去努力的实际行动中，建立在互相督促、维护党的利益的基础之上。现在我们党对贪污犯的政策是：自动彻底坦白者从宽处理，拒不坦白被人检举者从严惩办。因此，当一个贪污分子已经横心顽固到成为党和人民的叛徒的时候，就必须毫不犹豫地检举他，而且要求严惩他。共产党员决不应该像这个贪污犯的“爱人”那样，既然表示爱党而又同时爱党的叛徒。这怎么可能呢！我们决不能容许任何“私情”渗入到崇高的共产党员的思想感情里面，从而缓和和冲淡了对一切坏分子的斗争！
