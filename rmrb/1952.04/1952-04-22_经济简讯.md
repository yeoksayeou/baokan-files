	▲ The fish fry catching season has arrived in the Central South region. Along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (from Songzi to Wuxue) and the banks of the Xiangjiang and Xijiang rivers, tens of thousands of fishermen are rushing to make nets and build sheds in preparation for casting their nets. Merchants and purchasing personnel from state-owned economic departments have flocked to production areas in Hubei and Hunan to purchase and transport freshwater fish fry such as black carp, silver carp, and grass carp.
	The Central South region is the main producing area of freshwater fish fry in the country. The region is expected to produce approximately 4.5 billion fish fry this year, an increase of one-third compared to last year.

	▲ In order to plan the development of new cotton-growing areas and meet the needs of national industrial construction, the East China Cotton Cultivation Preparatory Committee was established on the 15th. The committee will be responsible for guiding the gradual reclamation of millions of mu of arable wasteland suitable for cotton planting in the three provinces of northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and northern Anhui.
