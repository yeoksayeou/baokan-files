    Beijing Fourth Hospital
    Formulates Measures to Strengthen Newspaper Reading and Study
    We recently conducted a survey of the newspaper reading and study habits of medical staff at Beijing Fourth Hospital. We found that among the ninety-plus staff members with reading ability, as many as five-sixths were not interested in reading and studying newspapers.

    Many people, due to their neglect of newspaper reading, have gradually become estranged from, or even completely isolated from, political issues. For example, the heinous crime of Chen Huaijiu, a lecturer in the Chemistry Department of Wuhan University, who helped the profiteer Li Yinting manufacture "emergency kits" to harm the Chinese People's Volunteers, has aroused the anger of the people of the whole country, but these medical staff members were completely unaware of it. Similarly, many people are unaware of the "Ji Kaifu incident," which is more closely related to our medical work.

    When asked why they didn't read the newspapers, most people emphasized that they were too busy. They said, "We are doing the Three-Anti, fighting epidemics, and still have to stick to our work. How can we have time to read the newspapers?" Some also said, "We have to read technical books when we have time, otherwise, we will fall behind." Some even said, "I simply don't have the habit of reading newspapers." In fact, these are all concrete manifestations of neglecting politics and purely technical viewpoints.

    In order to quickly and effectively correct the serious phenomenon of neglecting newspaper reading, we organized everyone to discuss the issue of newspaper reading. Everyone believes that the main problem is to overcome the erroneous idea of neglecting politics and cultivate a conscious and regular political interest in reading newspapers. We have also initially stipulated measures to strengthen newspaper reading and study: First, the hospital trade union will organize newspaper reading groups, establish regular study systems, and continuously conduct inspections and supervision; Second, designate appropriate people to provide popular explanations and guidance to those who have no reading ability or poor reading ability; Third, a dedicated person will be responsible for distributing and storing newspapers, and fix reading locations to give full play to the effectiveness of newspapers and not waste a single newspaper; Fourth, appropriately coordinate current affairs reports or symposiums with central movements, and conduct tests on newspaper reading and study when necessary.

### 北京市第四医院  制订了加强读报学习的办法

    北京市第四医院
    制订了加强读报学习的办法
    编辑同志：最近，我们在北京市第四医院的医务工作人员中，进行了一次读报学习情况的调查，发现在九十多名有阅读能力的工作人员中，不关心读报学习的竟占六分之五。
    许多人由于忽视读报，所以对政治问题就逐渐疏远甚至完全隔阂起来了。如武汉大学化学系讲师陈怀九帮助奸商李寅廷制造暗害中国人民志愿军的“救急包”的滔天罪行，已引起全国人民的愤怒，但是这些医务工作者们却一无所闻。又如和我们医务工作者关系比较密切的“纪凯夫事件”也有许多人不知道。
    当问到他们为什么不看报时，大多数人是强调工作太忙，他们说：“又三反，又防疫，又要坚持工作，那有工夫看报。”也有人说：“有时间还要看看技术书呢，不然，就落伍了。”甚至还有人表示：“我根本没有看报的习惯。”其实，这些都是忽视政治、单纯技术观点的具体表现。
    为了迅速而有效地纠正忽视读报的严重现象，我们组织大家针对读报问题进行了讨论，大家认为，主要的问题，是克服忽视政治的错误思想，培养自觉的经常读报的政治兴趣。我们并且初步规定了加强读报学习的办法：第一、由医院工会组织读报小组，订出经常的学习制度，并不断地进行检查，督促；第二、指定适当的人对没有阅读能力或阅读能力较差的人，作通俗解说，给予辅导；第三、由专人负责发报和保管，并固定阅读地点，充分发挥报纸效用，不浪费一张报纸；第四、适当地配合中心运动举行时事报告或座谈会，必要时进行关于读报学习的测验。
