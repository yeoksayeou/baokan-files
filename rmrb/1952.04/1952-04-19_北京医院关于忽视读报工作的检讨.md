Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Beijing Hospital's Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting Newspaper Reading
    To the Editors: The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on March 22nd criticized the phenomenon of some staff members in our hospital not paying attention to reading newspapers. This criticism is entirely correct. According to our investigation, 25% of the staff in the entire hospital do not read newspapers at all, and 45% only read the headlines. In order to change this serious situation, we have successively held political work meetings, all-staff meetings, and propaganda worker meetings, where leading comrades made self-criticisms and discussed ways to improve.
    There are two reasons why our hospital staff neglects reading newspapers: First, leading cadres have a purely task-oriented viewpoint, focusing only on immediate tasks and failing to read newspapers regularly themselves. Second, leading cadres mistakenly believe that general staff members have sufficient reading ability and therefore abandoned leadership over newspaper reading. During the "Three-Anti" movement, due to the busy workload, leadership over newspaper reading was even more mistakenly relaxed.
    Based on the above situation, we have stipulated the following improvement measures: 1. Comrades in the office will be assigned to lead various newspaper reading groups. 2. Each cadre study group will select one to two propaganda workers to lead everyone in reading the People's Daily; each worker study group will select one newspaper reader to lead everyone in collectively reading the Worker's Daily; taking the Communist Youth League branch as the core, absorbing young people, each group will select one person to lead everyone in reading the China Youth Daily; soldiers will select one person per squad to lead everyone in reading the People's Liberation Army Daily. 3. In the past, the public has subscribed to 38 newspapers. It has been decided to subscribe to an additional 5 copies of the People's Daily and 13 copies of the Worker's Daily. 4. Regarding the newspaper reading system and methods: The administrative side stipulates that each person has half an hour to one hour of newspaper reading time each day; cadre reading groups will focus on individual reading, with weekly collective discussions, bi-weekly comprehensive reports, and monthly or bi-monthly tests; worker reading groups will focus on collective reading, with leading comrades giving at least one report per week and monthly or bi-monthly tests; establish newspaper posting boards and current affairs Q&A columns, and use loudspeakers to broadcast important news.
    Through discussion, everyone has recognized the importance of reading newspapers, and many comrades have already subscribed to newspapers themselves.

    China Union Medical College's Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting Newspaper Reading
    To the Editors: The criticism of our college's neglect of newspaper reading in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 22nd is entirely correct. For a considerable period, we have been satisfied with vigorous shock campaigns, and have not paid attention to regular newspaper reading and learning. On March 23rd, we organized an investigation team to focus on understanding the political life of nurses, and instructed each unit to check the status of newspaper reading and learning in their unit based on the criticism in the newspaper. The results proved that the situation of our college staff neglecting newspaper reading is even more serious than what was revealed by readers Yuan Zheng and others. We subscribe to a lot of newspapers, but very few people read them. According to preliminary statistics, out of 848 people in 43 units, more than 460 people, or 60%, do not read newspapers. They do not read newspapers not because they are busy and "have no time," but mainly because they neglect politics. Some people, in their spare time, besides reading professional books, read literary works by bourgeois authors, decadent or even reactionary works such as American novels, magazines, pictorials, and biblical novels, or engage in raising fish, raising pigeons, listening to records, chatting, etc.; some people spend a lot of time paying attention to dressing up and makeup. In short, purely technical viewpoints and bourgeois lifestyles are corroding these people's minds, and their tendency to not care about politics is very serious. The problem of neglecting newspaper reading exists not only among the above-mentioned people, but also among the trainees or interns transferred from the military.
    The hospital leadership is responsible for the fact that the above-mentioned phenomenon has not been corrected for a long time. We did not realize that newspapers are important weapons for guiding actual struggle, and we did not realize that organizing the masses to read newspapers is one of the most important propaganda and education tasks. We committed serious bureaucracy in leading newspaper reading in the past. In order to correct our mistakes immediately, in addition to publicizing the significance of reading newspapers to staff members, we have begun to establish the following work systems: (1) Establish newspaper reading groups, using the original study groups as reading groups, and hold irregular current affairs quizzes. (2) Set up five newspaper reading boards, marking key points on major issues in the newspapers; set up three broadcast loudspeakers, and organize staff to listen to broadcasts on time. (3) Uniformly adjust the newspapers in each unit of the hospital to ensure that there is at least one newspaper for every ten people on average. (4) Prepare to establish a political book and newspaper library. (5) Make a systematic current affairs report once a month.

### 北京医院关于忽视读报工作的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京医院关于忽视读报工作的检讨
    编辑同志：三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏对我院某些工作人员不重视读报的现象提出批评，这种批评是完全正确的。据我们调查：全院有百分之二十五的工作人员根本不看报，有百分之四十五的工作人员只看大标题。为了改变这种严重情况，我们连续召开了政治工作会议、全院工作人员大会、宣传员会议，由领导同志作了检讨，并且讨论了改进的办法。
    我院工作人员忽视读报，有两个原因：第一，领导干部有单纯任务观点，什么忙就搞什么，自己也不能经常读报；第二、领导干部错误地认为一般工作人员都有一定的阅读能力，因而放弃了关于读报的领导。在“三反”运动期间，由于工作较忙，更错误地放松了对读报工作的领导。
    根据上述情况，我们规定了如下改进办法：一、办公室的同志分工领导各种读报组织。二、每一干部学习组选出一至二名宣传员，领导大家阅读人民日报；工人学习组每组选出一名读报员，领导大家集体阅读工人日报；以青年团小组为核心，吸收青年群众，每组选出一人，领导大家阅读中国青年报；军人以班为单位，选出一人领导大家阅读人民解放军报。三、过去公家已订报纸三十八份，决定再增订人民日报五份，工人日报十三份。四、关于读报制度和读报方法：行政方面规定每人每日有半小时至一小时的读报时间；干部读报组以个人阅读为主，每周集体讨论一次，每两周作一次综合性报告，每月或两月测验一次；工人读报组以集体读报为主，领导同志每周至少作一次报告，每月或两月测验一次；设立贴报牌和时事问答栏，并利用播音器广播重要新闻。
    经过讨论，大家都认识了读报的重要性，已有不少同志自己订了报纸。　　　　　北京医院办公室
    协和医学院关于忽视读报工作的检讨
    编辑同志：三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏对于我院忽视读报工作提出的批评，是完全正确的。在相当长的时期内，我们只满足于轰轰烈烈的突击运动，对于经常的读报学习，一直没有予以重视。三月二十三日，我们组织了调查组，有重点地了解护士们的政治生活的情形，并责成各单位根据报纸上的批评，检查本单位读报学习的情况。结果证明，我院工作人员忽视读报的情况，比读者袁政等所揭发的情况还要严重。我们订的报纸是不少的，但是看报的人却很少。据初步统计：在四十三个单位八百四十八人中，不读报的就有四百六十余人，占百分之六十。他们不读报纸，并不是由于工作忙，“没有时间”，主要原因是忽视政治。有些人在空暇时间，除了看看业务书籍以外，或者看些资产阶级作者的文艺作品，美国小说、杂志、画报及圣经小说等腐朽的甚至反动的作品，或者是养鱼、养鸽、听唱片、聊天等等；有些人则用许多时间，讲究修饰和化装。总之，单纯技术观点和资产阶级的生活方式腐蚀着这些人的思想，他们的不问政治的倾向是十分严重的。忽视读报的问题，不仅在上述这些人中存在着，而且在那些从部队中调来进修的学员或实习医生中也存在着。
    上述现象长期没有得以纠正，医院领导方面是有责任的。我们没有认识到报纸是指导实际斗争的重要武器，没有认识到组织群众读报是最重要的宣传教育工作任务之一。我们过去在领导读报工作上，犯了严重的官僚主义。为了立即改正错误，我们除了向工作人员宣传读报的意义外，并已开始建立了下列工作制度：（一）建立读报小组，以原学习小组为读报组，并举行不定期的时事测验。（二）设立读报牌五处，对于报纸上的重大问题标圈重点；设立播音喇叭三处，按时组织工作人员收听广播。（三）统一调整全院各单位报纸，做到最少平均十人有一份报纸。（四）准备设立政治书报图书馆。（五）每月作一次有系统的时事报告。
