    North China Administrative Committee Convenes North China Economic Conference
    Decides to Strengthen Economic Construction Work in North China Region
    The North China Administrative Committee convened the North China Economic Conference from March 24th to 27th, deciding to strengthen various economic construction tasks in the North China region following the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns.

    The conference first affirmed the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the North China region, which not only repelled the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks and purged corrupt and thieving elements within and outside the national economic departments, but also mobilized the masses, raised the consciousness of the working class, and laid the foundation for future production increase and thrift. The conference particularly emphasized that the leadership's focus must now shift to business operations, swiftly resolving the problem of material supplies necessary for the people's production and life.

    Therefore, the conference decided that it is currently necessary to utilize the favorable situation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to strengthen the following economic construction tasks:

    First, it is crucial to quickly rectify organizations, adjust cadres, and shift the focus of leadership in financial and economic departments to production and business operations. Therefore, except for allocating some manpower to handle corrupt elements and continue the "tiger" hunt, starting from early April, two-thirds of the efforts should be dedicated to production and business work. Secondly, immediately restore disrupted links and clear the channels between upper and lower levels. For incomplete institutions, first supplement key cadres, and boldly promote a group of activists from within the system and unit who have been tested in the "Three-Anti" campaign, are clean-handed, have a firm stance, and are politically reliable, to fill the cadre vacancies. Corrupt elements who are not severely corrupt and have thoroughly confessed and repented should be educated and reformed and assigned appropriate work. Thirdly, for some economic institutions that can be streamlined or merged, provinces and cities, after careful study and with the approval of higher authorities, can streamline, merge, and adjust them. The current mindset of some cadres in economic departments who only want to hunt tigers but are unwilling to engage in business operations, or are unwilling to do economic work, must be explained and criticized.

    Second, in terms of trade, cotton and agricultural and sideline products should be purchased and pre-purchased in large quantities in rural areas immediately; it is particularly emphasized that local native product sales should be vigorously organized using the original herbal medicine fairs, mule and horse fairs, and temple fairs in various places; the old relationships used for trading at the North China urban and rural material exchange exhibitions should be used to open up domestic sales channels for North China native products, and material exports and foreign sales should be actively organized. The conference pointed out that the North China Regional Company of China Native Produce Company convened all state-owned trade representatives in Tianjin and held two native product exchange symposiums, signing contracts and agreements worth 6 billion yuan (including 1.4 billion yuan in cash transactions), opening up sales channels for slow-moving agricultural and sideline products. This approach is worth emulating in various places. As for fertilizers, waterwheels, and farm tools that farmers urgently need during spring plowing and sowing, and coal that rural areas (especially cotton-producing areas) urgently need, cooperatives need to immediately organize transportation and sales to deliver them to farmers. In particular, for the supply of coal, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company currently has no sales organizations in rural areas, and cooperatives should take on this task well.

    In cities, processing orders should be quickly restored, and stockpiled products should be purchased. The financial and economic committees of each province and city should seriously study and resolve reasonable processing fees and cost accounting after the "Five-Anti" campaign. If new standards cannot be set immediately, the old standards can be temporarily followed, and adjustments will be made later according to the new standards, but the principle is to strengthen market supply. For material exchange contracts that have already been signed, they must be carefully checked and implemented according to the original contracts. If one party cannot implement the contract due to changes in circumstances, the other party needs to be notified quickly for consultation to avoid losses. In addition, a new batch of contracts should be actively signed according to the new situation to massively promote the sales of urban and rural products.

    Third, in terms of industry, the "Three-Anti" movement in North China's industrial and mining enterprises mainly focused on anti-corruption, and the serious waste in enterprise management, basic construction, and production processes, as well as the bureaucracy that caused this waste, have not been seriously eliminated. Therefore, after the anti-corruption effort, industrial and mining enterprises must systematically set aside a period of time to mobilize the masses to carry out a struggle against waste and bureaucracy. Examine design errors, shoddy workmanship, and various theft behaviors in basic construction, and correct the erroneous view of abandoning political leadership and relying solely on technicians; examine the waste caused by the large amount of stockpiled funds, the lack or imperfection of systems, and the unreasonable organization of labor; examine the waste in raw material supply, product sales, and administrative management. Seriously expose these wasteful phenomena, find out their causes and responsibilities, and formulate specific methods to overcome them in the future. At the end of the "Three-Anti" campaign, a construction phase should be entered, and various systems should be established and improved based on the problems exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement. In the process of anti-waste, work such as asset clearing, capital verification, completion of various plans, and implementation of democratic reforms should also be carried out simultaneously. Especially for planning work, industrial leadership departments at all levels must be determined to allocate sufficient cadres to establish planning organizations. In completing the production tasks for the second quarter, the unfinished tasks of the first quarter must also be made up.

    The conference decided that, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, a large-scale, continuous, and region-wide patriotic production competition movement should be launched under leadership starting in June this year to ensure the completion and exceeding of this year's production increase and thrift plan. Then, "quota inspection" work should be carried out and cost management should be implemented, striving to complete the main tasks of the economic accounting system before the end of this year.

    Other issues such as finance, banking, taxation, agricultural production cooperatives, and disaster relief were also studied at the conference, and decisions were made to effectively solve the problems. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北行政委员会召开华北经济会议
    决定加强华北地区经济建设工作
    华北行政委员会在三月二十四日到二十七日召开了华北经济会议，决定加强华北地区“三反”、“五反”以后的各种经济建设工作。
    会议首先肯定华北地区“三反”和“五反”运动的伟大成绩，不仅打退了资产阶级的疯狂进攻，清除了国家经济部门内外的贪污盗窃分子，同时发动了群众，提高了工人阶级的觉悟，给今后的增产节约打下了基础。会议特别强调目前必须把领导重点转到业务上去，迅速解决当前人民生产和生活所必需的物资供应问题。
    因此会议决定，目前必须利用“三反”和“五反”运动的有利形势，加强以下各种经济建设工作：
    第一、迅速整顿组织，调整干部，把财经部门的领导重点转到生产和业务上去，这是解决一切问题的决定关键。因此，目前除以一部分力量进行对贪污分子的处理和继续打“虎”工作外，从四月初旬起，要以三分之二的力量专门搞生产和业务工作。其次，立即恢复打断了的环节，打通上下的联系。对残缺不全的机构，首先补充主要干部，并应大胆地从本系统、本单位内提拔一批在“三反”中经过考验的、手面干净、立场坚定、政治上可靠的积极分子，补充干部缺额。对于贪污不严重并彻底坦白悔过的贪污分子，予以教育改造，分配适当的工作。再次，有些可以精简、合并的经济机构，各省市经过慎重研究，经上级批准后，可以精简、合并和调整。对于当前经济部门某些干部只愿打虎不愿搞业务，或不愿去做经济工作等思想，必须加以解释和批判。
    第二、贸易方面，在农村应即大量收购、预购棉花和农业副业产品；特别强调利用各地原有的药材大会、骡马大会、庙会大力组织土产推销；运用原在华北城乡物资交流展览会上作过买卖的旧关系，打开华北土产的国内销路，积极组织物资出口外销。会议指出：中国土产公司华北区公司召集了所有在天津的各地国营贸易代表，开了两次土产交流座谈会，签订值六十亿元的合同和协议（其中现款交易就有十四亿元），为滞销的农副产品打开销路，这种办法，值得各地仿效。至于春耕播种中农民最急需的肥料、水车、农具和目前农村里（特别是产棉区）急需的煤炭，需要合作社马上组织运销，送到农民手里。特别是煤炭的供给，中国煤业建筑器材公司目前在农村没有推销机构，合作社要很好地担负这个任务。
    在城市里，要很快地恢复加工订货，收购积压的产品。各省、市财经委员会要认真研究解决“五反”以后合理的工缴费和成本计算。如果不能马上订出新的标准来，可暂时按照旧的标准去做，将来再按新标准长退短补，但以加强市场供应为原则。对于已经签订的物资交流合同，必须很好地检查一下，按照原来合同执行。如其中一方面因为情况变化，的确不能执行合同时，也需要很快通知对方协商解决，以免造成损失。并应根据新的情况，努力再订一批新的合同，以便大量推销城乡的产品。
    第三、在工业方面，目前华北工矿的“三反”运动，主要是进行了反贪污，而对于在企业管理、基本建设和生产过程中的严重浪费，以及造成这种浪费的官僚主义，尚未认真地进行清除。因此，工矿企业在反贪污之后，必须有计划地拿出一段时间，认真发动群众，开展反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。检查基本建设的设计错误、偷工减料和各种偷窃行为，并纠正放弃政治领导，单纯依靠技术人员的错误观点；检查大量积压资金、制度缺乏或不健全、劳动组织不合理所造成的浪费现象；检查原材料供给、产品推销和行政管理上的浪费现象。认真地把这些浪费现象揭发出来，找出它的原因和责任所在，订出今后具体克服的办法。在“三反”末期，要进入一个建设阶段，根据“三反”运动中所暴露出来的问题，建立和健全各种制度。在反浪费的过程当中，还应同时进行清理资产核定资金，完成各种计划和贯彻民主改革等工作。特别是计划工作，各级工业领导部门必须下决心配备足够的干部，把计划机构建立起来。在完成第二季度生产任务当中，还必须补上第一季度未完成的任务。
    会议决定，要在“三反”运动的基础上，自今年六月开始，有领导地开展一个全区性大规模的连续的爱国生产竞赛运动，来保证完成并超过今年的增产节约计划。然后进行“定额检查”工作和实行成本管理，争取在今年年底以前，把经济核算制的各项主要工作作好。
    其他如财政、金融、税收、农业生产合作社和救灾等问题，会议上也经过研究作出了切实解决问题的决定。（新华社）
