Newspaper Reading Group Activities

    Ningxia, Zhongwei County, Second District, Four Townships

    Half of the Villagers Participate in Newspaper Reading Group Activities

    Editor: In the Second District and Four Townships of Zhongwei County, Ningxia, there are a total of fifty-six newspaper reading groups, with more than one thousand people participating in listening to the news, accounting for about half of the township's population. Each of the more than twenty natural villages in the township subscribes to the Ningxia Daily. It truly is "every village subscribes to the newspaper, every household listens to the news." In the past, the work in this township was not good, and the personnel of the district government considered it a backward township. Since the establishment of the newspaper reading groups, all aspects of work have become vibrant. Take the collection of public grain as an example. In the past, farmers were urged to pay repeatedly, but it could not be completed on time. After the establishment of the newspaper reading groups, public grain was collected in full within two days during the autumn harvest last year. Upon seeing the appeal from the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association regarding donating airplanes and cannons in the newspaper, the masses in the township voluntarily donated 14 million RMB, three camels, one cow, and more than fifty taels of silver jewelry without waiting for mobilization from higher authorities. These examples are enough to show the significant impact of newspaper reading among the masses.

    When the township's newspaper reading groups were first established, they fell into a state of drift due to a lack of leadership. Later, leading cadres from the district convened meetings of the Communist Youth League, farmers' associations, women's federations, and newspaper reading group leaders to establish a township newspaper reading guidance committee, responsible for leading the newspaper reading work throughout the township. Each administrative village established a central newspaper reading group, responsible for leading the newspaper reading work throughout the village. The meeting stipulated that the township should meet every half month and the village every five days to report and study various issues related to newspaper reading groups. The Liu Jia Jia Qu newspaper reading group in one village did not have anyone to read the newspaper. The central newspaper reading group discovered this situation and tried to allocate suitable personnel from other groups. The township unified the newspaper subscription procedures, overcoming the confusion of submitting newspaper fees and the phenomenon of newspapers not being delivered. Leaders at all levels frequently inspect and supervise the newspaper reading groups. In this way, the newspaper reading groups gradually became consolidated and improved.

    In order to ensure regular newspaper reading, the township's newspaper reading groups collectively formulated a newspaper reading covenant. The content is: (1) Actively respond to and publicize all calls from the Party and the People's Government; (2) Read the newspaper carefully, ensure that the newspaper reading work is maintained for a long time, and never stop halfway; (3) Each newspaper reading group guarantees to write an article or a letter to the newspaper every month; (4) Ensure that regular group leader meetings are held to study newspaper reading work and solve the problems raised by everyone. The township's newspaper reading groups also challenged newspaper reading groups throughout the province with these conditions.

    The experience of newspaper reading work in this township shows that mass newspaper reading work must be done well under the strong leadership of the Party, and the Party must carry out concrete work through propagandists. The township's newspaper reading committee and the central newspaper reading groups in each village are all composed with propagandists as the core.

    Secondly, the township's newspaper reading groups are well integrated with production and recreational activities, which is also an important experience. The newspaper reading methods of the newspaper reading groups in this county are very flexible. During the busy farming season, the newspaper reading groups are combined with mutual aid teams, and the newspapers are brought to the fields. During breaks, the newspaper reader reads the newspaper. The masses say that this method is "reading newspapers and production are not delayed"; during the slack winter season, large group reading is adopted, and newspaper reading is combined with recreational activities. Before and after reading the newspaper, everyone is taught to sing songs, Qinqiang opera, and storytelling with clapper, etc. Therefore, listening to the news has become one of everyone's favorite things. Newspaper readers often compile the news from the newspaper into storytelling with clapper or stories to tell to everyone; and promptly publicize important policies and decrees through blackboard newspapers and loudspeakers. In case of important matters, the newspaper reading committee also plans to organize everyone to discuss them. Ping

### 宁夏中卫县二区四乡  半数村民参加了读报组活动

专栏：读报组活动

    宁夏中卫县二区四乡
    半数村民参加了读报组活动
    编辑同志：宁夏中卫县二区四乡共有五十六个读报组，参加听报的群众有一千多人，约占全乡人口的半数。该乡二十多个自然村，每村都订了宁夏日报。真正是“村村订报，家家听报”。过去这个乡的工作并不好，区政府的人员认为它是落后乡。自从建立了读报组以后，各项工作都有了生气。就拿征收公粮来说吧。过去三番五次地向农民催缴，但是不能按期完成。建立读报组后，在去年秋天征收公粮时两天之内就征齐了。该乡群众在报上看到抗美援朝总会关于捐献飞机大炮的号召，没有等待上级动员，就自动捐献了人民币一千四百万元，骆驼三只、牛一条和银首饰五十多两。这些事例，足以说明读报在群众中发生了重大的影响。
    该乡读报组刚刚成立以后，由于无人领导，曾经陷入自流状态。后来，区的领导干部召开了青年团、农会、妇女会和读报组长会议，成立了乡的读报指导委员会，负责领导全乡的读报工作；各行政村成立了中心读报组，负责领导全村的读报工作。会上规定，乡每半月、村每五天开会一次，汇报和研究有关读报组的各种问题。一村刘家夹渠读报组没有念报的人，中心读报组发现了这种情况，就设法在其他组中调配了合适的人员。全乡统一了订报手续，克服了送缴报费的混乱现象和报纸投送不到的现象。各级领导人经常对各读报组进行检查、督促。这样，读报组慢慢获得了巩固和提高。
    为了保证经常读报，全乡读报组集体订立了读报公约。内容是：（一）积极响应、宣传党和人民政府的一切号召；（二）认真读报，保证把读报工作长期坚持下去，决不半途停止；（三）每个读报组保证每月给报社写一篇稿子，或者写一封信；（四）保证召开定期的组长会议，研究读报工作，解决大家提出的问题。该乡读报组并以这几个条件，向全省读报组提出挑战。
    这个乡的读报工作经验说明，群众性的读报工作，必须在党的坚强领导下才能作好，而党必须通过宣传员来进行具体工作。该乡的读报委员会和各村的中心读报组，都是以宣传员为核心组成的。
    其次，该乡的读报组很好地和生产及文娱活动结合起来，这也是一个重要的经验。该县读报组的读报方法非常灵活。农忙时，就把读报组和变工互助组结合起来，把报纸带到地里，在休息时间，由读报员读报。群众说这种方法是“读报生产两不误”；冬闲时则采取大组读报形式，并且把读报和文娱活动结合起来，在读报前后教大家唱歌、唱秦腔、说快板，等等。因此，听报成了大家最喜欢的事情之一。读报员经常把报上的消息编成快板或故事，说给大家听；并把重要的政策、法令，及时通过黑板报、广播筒宣传出去。遇有重要的事情，读报委员会还有计划地组织大家进行讨论。  平
