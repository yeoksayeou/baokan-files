Editor's Note: Developing a good production increase plan is an important step in increasing unit area yield and carrying out the patriotic production increase movement. Cui Zhusong, a model for rice production in Jilin Province, led all members of the agricultural production cooperative to develop a practical and feasible production increase plan through democratic discussion. They broke through the conservative thinking of the members who believed that "production had reached its limit," came up with concrete methods to increase production, and increased their confidence in increasing production. This experience is worth learning from by labor models in various regions. The process of formulating the production increase plan of the Cui Zhusong Agricultural Production Cooperative and their production increase plan are introduced below:

The Cui Zhusong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangnan Street, Yanji City, Jilin Province, Northeast China, has just been developed from a mutual aid team. Last year, the Cui Zhusong mutual aid team created a high-yield achievement of more than 1,200 jin of rice per mu (Northeast mu, each mu is equal to 1.5 city mu), and has been awarded as a high-yield rice mutual aid team by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. In March of this year, the Cui Zhusong Agricultural Production Cooperative formulated a production increase plan of 1,600 jin of rice per mu for this year. The process of formulating this plan is as follows:

After Cui Zhusong, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, returned from attending the Jilin Provincial Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, he immediately gathered the members for a meeting to discuss how to respond to Chairman Gao Gang's call for increasing grain production by five sheng per mu and how to formulate a production increase plan. At that time, the members all held the idea that "increasing production is impossible." For example, member Cui Daoyun said: "Last year's production increase was the best we could do; it's impossible to increase production any further." Seeing this situation, Cui Zhusong, on the one hand, discussed ways to increase production with the key members of the cooperative, and on the other hand, explained to the masses: "More fertilizer and better management of the seedling beds can increase production." But everyone still said: "It's possible to produce a few more jin of grain, but it's impossible to increase production by five sheng per mu." After several days of persuasion and education, the masses still had no confidence in increasing production. Cui Zhusong and Jin Dinghou, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch (also a member of the cooperative), re-discussed and studied this issue in detail. They first started by calculating the yield per ping of rice field last year (ping is a unit of measuring cultivated land area in Northeast China, each area of six chi square is one ping, and there are 302 ping per mu). They used the medium-sized rice ears left over from last year as a standard and found that each rice ear had 100 grains. One tuft of rice has 20 ears (last year each tuft had 22 ears), and each tuft of rice can produce 2,000 grains. If planted in a straight row, one tuft of rice can be planted every eight inches square, and 56 tufts can be planted per ping of paddy field. According to this calculation, each ping of paddy field can produce 112,000 grains of rice. They then weighed a portion of the rice grains and counted that each jin of rice contained 17,800 grains. This number of grains is roughly equal to the yield of nine tufts of rice. Using this number as a ratio, each mu of paddy field can produce more than 1,880 jin of rice. After deducting the 30 ping of area occupied by the ridges of each mu of field, it can still produce more than 1,680 jin of grain. Then, they held a meeting of cooperative members and introduced the calculated numbers and the calculation process to everyone. As a result, everyone no longer said "it's impossible." Some members even said: "You only calculated 20 ears per tuft of rice and 100 grains per ear; in fact, according to last year's situation, there were more than 20 ears per tuft and more than 100 grains per ear. There is definitely no problem in striving for a yield of more than 1,600 jin per mu this year!" So, everyone had confidence in increasing production by five sheng of grain.

After everyone had a number in their minds, Cui Zhusong led all the members to start studying methods to increase production. Member Cui Jingqi proposed that they should study "what aspects of last year's agricultural production still need to be improved" and "how to tap the potential of production." At first, some cooperative members did not know what the "potential of agricultural production" was; branch secretary Jin Dinghou explained to them: "For example, if we should apply more fertilizer this year, then we should find the source of fertilizer; if we want to prevent drought and fight drought, we should find the resources to develop water conservancy; thinking of ways to increase production from these aspects is called tapping the potential of production. Furthermore, selecting superior varieties, intensive cultivation, etc., can all tap the potential of production." After this explanation, everyone felt that they had a path to follow and proposed methods to increase production. Some people said: "The thatch on the roofs of five or six members' houses has been there for more than ten years; if we replace it with new thatch and take down the old thatch to make fertilizer, it will be good for the homeowners and for us." Some people said: "We should dig up the mud deposited at the water inlets and put it in the rice fields to fertilize the fields." Some said: "We should destroy the old field ridges and expand the area of the rice fields." Some said: "If we apply less fertilizer to the rice fields with good soil and more fertilizer to the rice fields with poor soil, we can increase production even if we use the same amount of fertilizer as last year." Some said: "The yield of Yuanzi No. 2 rice variety is greater than that of Xinjing rice and Improved Hokkaido rice, so we can plant Yuanzi No. 2 this year." These opinions aroused heated discussions among all the members. Some members opposed planting Yuanzi No. 2, saying: "We have a lot of wetlands in our cooperative, and Yuanzi No. 2 cannot mature early in wetlands." So everyone thought of ways to promote the early maturity of Yuanzi No. 2 from the perspective of seedling cultivation. As a result, all members unanimously agreed to switch to Yuanzi No. 2. Other various opinions were also agreed upon by everyone.

After formulating the production increase plan for paddy and dry land, some members still had many concerns in their minds. They were mainly concerned that there would be too much work this year and they were afraid they would not be able to handle it. In order to solve this problem, everyone felt that it was necessary to correctly calculate and appropriately adjust the labor force. At this time, Cui Zhusong and other leading cadres guided everyone to study the labor force used last year. As a result, many phenomena of wasted labor were discovered. For example, in flue-cured tobacco production, a lot of labor was wasted due to the lack of planning; each household's individual management of the water volume in the paddy fields also wasted a lot of labor. In addition, work was stopped during festivals such as Mid-Summer and Third-Summer, which should not have been rested, and the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, where resting for one day was enough, were rested for two or three days, which also wasted a lot of labor. In total, 645 workdays were wasted last year. Everyone also studied the number of workdays required to increase the amount of fertilizer accumulated and transported this year, the number of workdays required to expand the area of deep plowing, and the area of straight-row sowing, as well as the number of workdays required to improve farming methods. In total, only 239 more workdays are required than last year. If the labor force is adjusted and used in a planned way, and no more waste occurs, not only will the labor force be fully sufficient, but 406 workdays can be saved. Calculating based on the seven months of labor time from April to October, two full-time laborers can be drawn to engage in sideline production. The results of this calculation dispelled all the concerns of the masses. After seven days of discussion, a production increase plan was finally formulated that was unanimously agreed upon by all members.

The Cui Zhusong Agricultural Production Cooperative's Production Increase Plan

I. Production Increase Goals

(1) In terms of paddy fields: Increase from last year's yield of 1,281 jin per mu to 1,600 jin per mu. The total output of 170 mu of paddy fields is 272,000 jin, and the increase in output is more than 54,000 jin.

(2) In terms of dry land: 44.5 mu of dry land is divided into 18 mu for flue-cured tobacco, 7 mu for flax, 4 mu for soybeans, and 15.5 mu for vegetables. The total output is equivalent to 65,262 jin of sorghum, exceeding the output increase requirement of 43,140 jin set by the Municipal People's Government.

(3) In terms of sideline occupations: The two laborers wasted in flue-cured tobacco production and other aspects last year will be invested in sideline production. Use the cooperative's funds of 7 million yuan to buy five calves and four pigs. In addition to the original eight pigs, plans are being made to buy 25 more pigs.

II. Methods to Increase Production

(1) Expand the cultivated area: Eliminate 50 field ridges, increasing the paddy field area by two mu.

(2) Increase fertilizer: Last year, more than 190 mu of rice were planted. In addition to 522 carts of grass fertilizer and human manure, 1,500 jin of chemical fertilizer were also applied. This year, 170 mu of rice will be planted. In addition to 1,197 carts of grass fertilizer, stove ash, broken wall soil, rotten thatch, tobacco stalks, human manure, etc., 2,500 jin of chemical fertilizer will be applied. This is 675 more carts of manure and soil fertilizer and 1,000 jin more chemical fertilizer than last year.

(3) Plant superior varieties: Last year, varieties such as "Yuanzi No. 2," "Xinjing Rice," "Improved Hokkaido," and "Early Frost Substitute" were planted. This year, except for 22.2 mu of land planted with "Early Frost Substitute," all the rest will be planted with the high-yielding "Yuanzi No. 2."

(4) Improve seedling bed management methods: Last year, due to poor management of the seedling beds, among more than 240 ping of seedling beds, the seedlings in more than 100 ping grew too tall, affecting the yield. This year, 180 ping of warm beds and 140 ping of dry-seeded seedlings will be sown during the Qingming Festival, and cold beds will be sown during the Guyu Festival. In addition, transplant seedlings one solar term earlier, according to the order of warm beds, cold beds, and dry-seeded seedlings, to overcome the shortcoming of rice seedlings growing too tall. Windbreak equipment will also be installed in the seedling beds to ensure that the seedlings are not damaged by wind.

(5) Implement deep plowing and intensive cultivation: (1) Last year, deep plowing of three cun was carried out on 52.4% of the land area; this year, deep plowing of three to four cun will be carried out on 80% of the area. (2) Last year, straight-row transplanting was carried out on 75% of the area; this year, straight-row transplanting of eight cun square will be carried out on 87% of the area. (3) In terms of weeding, the weeding machine was used twice last year, and manual weeding was done twice; this year, the weeding machine will be used one more time. In addition, this year, the "triangular planting method" will be tested on 3.3 mu of paddy fields, and 10 mu of land will be used as a "seed collection nursery" to ensure that the seeds reach 100% purity next year.

III. Guarantee Conditions

(1) Maintain close contact with the Party and government leading organs to strengthen leadership. Promptly resolve all problems that occur within the cooperative. Hold a member's meeting once a month to summarize the work and propose the next phase of goals. Hold a cooperative affairs management committee meeting once every ten days to inspect and supervise the implementation of the plan.

(2) Strengthen political, current affairs, and cultural learning. Male and female members over 40 years old participate in the newspaper reading group, and adult members under 40 years old participate in the peasant school. Conduct regular prospects education for all members to further cultivate the collectivist spirit of the members.

(3) Maintain close contact with supply and marketing cooperatives in order to promptly supply members with the means of production and living.

(4) Carry out reasonable adjustment of the labor force, strengthen the division of labor and specialization, and improve labor efficiency.

(5) Pay attention to the female labor force, set up temporary nurseries according to the needs of seasonal production, to improve the labor efficiency of women.

(6) Do a good job in preparing for drought prevention and drought resistance. In order to prevent spring drought, dikes have been built on the sides of two ponds, and a water source of 15 mu has been developed (which has been completed). Two artesian wells have been repaired next to the seedling beds, which can prevent any drought disasters.

(7) Re-establish patriotic covenants, propose production increase competition conditions, and launch production increase competitions inside and outside the cooperative.

    吉林延吉市崔竹松农业生产合作社怎样打破保守思想订出增产计划
    吴泰镐
    编者按：订好增产计划，是提高单位面积产量、开展爱国增产运动的一个重要环节。吉林省水稻丰产模范崔竹松领导农业生产合作社全体社员，经过民主讨论，制订了切实可行的增产计划，打破了社员们“增产到顶”的保守思想，想出了增产的具体办法，提高了增产的信心。这个经验很值得各地劳动模范学习。现在把崔竹松农业生产合作社制订增产计划的经过和他们的增产计划介绍如下：
    东北吉林省延吉市江南街崔竹松农业生产合作社，是刚从互助组发展起来的。崔竹松互助组在去年曾创造了每亩（东北亩，每亩等于一点五市亩，下同）产水稻一千二百多斤的丰产成绩，已被中央人民政府农业部奖为水稻丰产互助组。今年三月，崔竹松农业生产合作社已制订了今年每亩水稻产一千六百斤的增产计划。这一计划的制订过程是这样的：
    农业生产合作社主任崔竹松参加吉林省工农兵代表大会回来以后，随即召集社员们在一起开会，讨论如何响应高岗主席关于每亩增产五升粮食的号召、如何制订增产计划等问题。当时社员们都抱着“增产办不到”的思想。如社员崔道允说：“去年增产算是增到家了；再要增产，那可办不到啦。”看到这种情况，崔竹松一方面跟社内的骨干分子讨论增产办法，一方面向群众解释说：“多上粪，再把苗床的管理工作搞好了，就可以增加产量。”但是大家还是说：“多打出几斤粮倒可以，要每亩增产五升粮，那可办不到。”经过好几天的说服教育，群众对增产仍然没有信心。崔竹松和中共支部书记金锭厚
    （也是社员之一）对这问题又重新做了详细的讨论和研究。他们首先从计算去年每坪稻田的产量入手（坪是东北地区的一种计算耕地面积单位，每六尺见方的面积为一坪，每亩共有三百零二坪）。他们把去年留下的中等稻穗作为标准，检查出每个稻穗都有一百个稻粒。一兜稻子，按二十个稻穗计算（去年每兜二十二个穗），每兜稻子可以出两千个粒。如按正条式的栽法种植，每八寸见方的地方可栽一兜稻，每坪水田则可以栽五十六兜。照这样推算起来，每坪水田就可以打出十一万二千个稻粒。他们再把一部分稻粒过秤，并数出每斤稻子共有一万七千八百个稻粒。这个粒数和九兜稻子的产量大体相等。拿这个数目作为比例推算起来，每亩水田可以出谷一千八百八十多斤。除去每亩田埂所占面积三十坪，还可出谷一千六百八十多斤。接着，他们两人就召开了社员会议，把计算出来的数字和计算经过向大家作了介绍。结果，大家再不说“办不到”了。有的社员还说：“你们把每兜稻子只按二十穗计算，每穗只按一百粒计算；其实按去年的情形看来，每兜不止二十穗，每穗也不止一百粒。今年争取每亩一千六百多斤的产量一定不成问题！”于是，大家对增产五升粮都有了信心。
    在大家的心里都有了个数儿以后，崔竹松又领导全体社员开始研究增产的方法。社员崔京七提出应该研究“在去年的农业生产上，那些方面还需要改进”，“要怎样才能发挥生产的潜在力量”等问题。最初，一些社员群众不知道“农业生产上的潜在力量”是什么东西；支部书记金锭厚就向他们解释说：“比如今年种地应当多上肥料，那么就要找出肥料的来源；要防旱抗旱，就要找出开拓水利的资源；从这些方面想出增产办法，就叫做发挥生产的潜在力量。再如选用优良品种，精耕细作等，都可以发挥生产的潜在力量。”经过这一解释，大家都觉得有了路子了，都提出了增产的办法。有的人说：“咱们有五、六所社员的住宅的房草已盖上十多年了；如果咱们给它换上新草，把那些陈草揭下来做成肥料，对于房主也好，对于咱们也好。”有的人说：“应该把淤在水口上的泥土挖起来，放到稻田里肥田。”有的说：“应该毁掉旧有的田埂，扩大稻田的面积。”有的说：“假如在土质好的稻田里少上肥料，土质不好的稻田里多上肥料，就是用和去年的一般多的肥料，也可以增加产量。”有的说：“元子二号稻种的产量较新京稻和改良北海道稻的产量大，今年可以都种元子二号。”这些意见引起了全体社员的热烈讨论。有的社员对种元子二号表示反对，他们说：“我们社内湿地多，元子二号在湿地里不能早熟。”于是大家又从育苗方面想出了办法，可以促进元子二号稻早熟。结果，全体社员一致同意改种元子二号。其他各种意见也得到了大家的同意。
    制订了水旱田的增产计划以后，有些社员在思想上仍有不少顾虑。他们主要是考虑到今年活儿太多，怕干不过来。为了解决这个问题，大家都觉得必须正确地计算和适当地调剂劳动力。这时崔竹松等领导骨干就引导大家研究去年使用劳动力的情况。结果，发现了许多浪费劳动力的现象。如在黄烟生产上，因缺乏计划，浪费了不少的劳动力；各户各自看水田的水量，也浪费了很多的劳动力。此外如中伏、三伏等不应该休息的节日也停止了工作，端午节、中秋节休息一天就够了，但却休息了两、三天，也浪费了不少劳动力。总计起来，去年共浪费了六百四十五个工。大家又研究了今年增加积肥送粪数量所需工数、扩大重翻地面积和正条式播种面积所需的工数，以及在改进耕作法等方面所需要增加的工数。总计起来，只须比去年增加二百三十九个工。如果对劳动力有计划地调剂使用，不再浪费，劳动力不仅全部够用，还能够剩出四百零六个工。以四月到十月共七个月的劳动时间计算，就可以抽出两个整劳动力来从事副业生产。这样计算的结果，打消了群众的一切顾虑。经过七天的讨论，最后制订出了一个全体社员一致同意的增产计划。
    崔竹松农业生产合作社的增产计划
    一、增产目标
    （一）在水田方面：在去年每亩产量一千二百八十一斤的基础上提高到每亩一千六百斤。一百七十亩的水田总产量为二十七万二千斤，增产量为五万四千多斤。
    （二）在旱田方面：四十四亩五分旱田分种黄烟十八亩、亚麻七亩、大豆四亩、青菜十五亩五分。总产量折合高粱六万五千二百六十二斤。超过市人民政府所要求的增产量四万三千一百四十斤。
    （三）在副业方面：把去年在黄烟生产上和其他方面所浪费的两个劳动力投入副业生产。用社的资金七百万元买进五头小牛和四口猪。此外，除原有的八口猪外，计划再买进二十五口猪。
    二、增产方法
    （一）扩大耕地面积：取消五十条田埂，增加水田二亩。
    （二）增加粪肥：去年种稻一百九十余亩，除上草粪人粪等共计五百二十二车外，还上了化学肥料一千五百斤。今年种稻一百七十亩，计划除上草粪、炕灰、破壁土、烂房草、烟草茎、人粪等共一千一百九十七车外，再加化学肥料两千五百斤。比去年多上粪肥土肥等六百七十五车，化学肥一千斤。
    （三）种优良品种：去年种的是“元子二号”
    “新京稻”“改良北海道”和“早霜代”等品种，今年除二十二亩二分地里种“早霜代”以外其余全部种高产量的“元子二号”。
    （四）改进苗床管理法：去年苗床因管理不善，二百四十多坪苗床中，有一百多坪苗床的苗长得过高，影响了产量。今年温床一百八十坪，干种苗一百四十坪，都在清明节下种，冷床在谷雨节下种。并按照温床、冷床、干种苗的次序提前一个节期插秧。克服稻苗长得过高的缺点。并安置苗床防风设备，保证秧苗不致因受风灾而损失。
    （五）实行深耕细作：（1）去年在百分之五十二点四的土地面积上实行三寸深的重翻地；今年要在百分之八十的面积上实行三寸到四寸深的重翻地。（2）去年在百分之七十五的面积上实行了正条式插秧；今年在百分之八十七的面积上实行八寸见方的正条式插秧。（3）在除草方面去年用除草机除两次，用手薅两次；今年要增加除草机除草一次。此外今年要在三亩三分的水田里试验实行“三角栽种法”并用十亩地作为“采种圃”，保证明年的种子达到百分之百的纯度。
    三、保证条件
    （一）和党、政领导机关取得密切联系，加强领导。及时解决社内所发生的一切问题。每月召开一次社员大会，总结工作，提出下期奋斗目标。每十天召开社务管理委员会一次，检查督促计划的实现。
    （二）加强政治、时事、文化学习，四十岁以上的男女社员都参加读报组，四十岁以下的成年社员则参加农民学校。对全体社员经常进行前途教育，使社员进一步养成集体主义精神。
    （三）和供销合作社保持密切联系，以便及时供给社员们的生产和生活资料。
    （四）进行劳动力的合理调剂，加强分工分业，提高劳动效率。
    （五）重视妇女劳动力，按季节生产的需要设置临时托儿所，以提高妇女们的劳动效率。
    （六）做好防旱抗旱的准备工作。为了防止春旱，在两个池边修堤防，开辟了十五亩地的水源（业已完成）。在苗床旁边修理两座自来水井，可以防止任何旱灾。
    （七）重新订立爱国公约，并提出增产竞赛条件，展开社内社外的增产竞赛。
