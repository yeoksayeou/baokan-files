Xinhua News Agency, March 31st:

    After the American side's scheme to undermine the agreement to enter administrative meetings on the fourth item of the Korean armistice talks agenda, and illegally reveal the meeting's content to British Reuters reporters for one-sided propaganda, was exposed, the American aggressors and their accomplice, British Reuters, hastily tried to deny and defend themselves, attempting to cover up their shameful behavior of undermining the agreement and obstructing the smooth progress of the meeting.
    In Tokyo, Nakos, the American press officer who is adept at lying and spreading rumors, facing the irrefutable fact that the American side violated the agreement by leaking the meeting's content, brazenly insisted in broad daylight and before everyone's eyes: "According to the news policy already stated by the United Nations Command, no substantive details about the administrative meetings have ever been leaked to the United Nations press." (Associated Press, Tokyo, March 28th) The American aggressors also instructed the Associated Press to come out on March 30th and lie, saying: "Tokyo generally believes that the British report is a commentary based on existing facts and logical assumptions, not based on any secret information obtained from secret meetings." The American aggressors attempted to shirk their responsibility for violating the agreement and revealing the meeting's content in this way.
    However, in their haste, the American aggressors apparently forgot to notify Reuters in London of this plan to make shameless denials, and did not expect that Reuters would hurriedly issue a news item about this matter on the evening of the 29th. This news item admitted that the report issued by the agency from Tokyo on the 25th was indeed a "news item," not a "commentary" written based on "existing facts and logical assumptions." In this way, the British lackey gave its American master the first resounding slap in the face. Then, in order to exonerate itself, Reuters quoted its Tokyo correspondent in this news item to argue in a self-contradictory manner that the "news" in the report of the 25th had "nothing to do with the United Nations Command in Korea." But it also said: This was "obtained from people in Tokyo." Reuters also reiterated a summary of the news that revealed the meeting's content. The truth was now fully exposed. Everyone knows that the so-called "people in Tokyo" who could reveal the meeting's content could not be anyone other than the American officials. This so-called "person in Tokyo" is the "authoritative person here (Tokyo)" referred to in the news written by the Reuters reporter based on American instructions, and is clearly the Ridgway headquarters and its responsible officials who, because of repeatedly delaying negotiations on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war, were in a "difficult situation" and therefore requested an administrative meeting. The American liars who insisted that they had not revealed the content of the meeting thus received a second crisp slap in the face from their British lackey. The extremely chaotic and self-contradictory lies made by the American aggressors and their accomplices in their panic not only failed to conceal their violation of the agreement, but on the contrary, further exposed to the people of the world the criminal face of the American side deliberately obstructing the smooth resolution of the issue of repatriating prisoners of war and delaying the Korean armistice talks.

### 美国侵略者及其英国帮凶制造矛盾百出的谎话  不能掩盖其破坏行政会议协议的可耻行为

    美国侵略者及其英国帮凶制造矛盾百出的谎话
    不能掩盖其破坏行政会议协议的可耻行为
    【新华社三十一日讯】在美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判会议第四项议程进入行政性会议的协议、非法地向英国路透社记者透露会议情况以进行片面宣传的阴谋被揭穿后，美国侵略者及其帮凶英国路透社慌忙进行抵赖和辩解，妄想掩盖其破坏协议，阻挠会议顺利进行的可耻行为。
    在东京，以撒谎造谣为能事的美方新闻发布官纳科斯面对美方违反协议泄漏会议内容的铁一般的事实，竟然在光天化日、众目睽睽之下，厚着脸皮一口咬定：“根据联合国军已经说明过的新闻政策，关于行政性会议，从来没有一点实质的详情向联合国新闻界泄露过。”（美联社东京二十八日电）美国侵略者同时授意美联社在三十日出来撒谎说：“东京一般以为，英国那项消息是一篇评论，根据的是已有的事实和逻辑的假定，并不是根据什么从秘密会议取得的秘密消息。”美国侵略者企图这样来把它们违反协议、透露会议内容的责任推脱干净。
    可是，美国侵略者在慌忙之中，显然忘记把这个进行无耻抵赖的计划通知在伦敦的路透社，也没有料到路透社在二十九日晚上就急急忙忙对这件事发出了一条新闻。这条新闻承认该社二十五日从东京发出的正是一条“消息”，而不是什么根据“已有的事实和逻辑的假定”所写的“评论”。这样，英国奴才就给了它的美国主人第一记响亮的耳光。接着，路透社为了替自己开脱责任，在这条新闻中引述了该社驻东京记者的话自相矛盾地辩解说，二十五日的报道中的“消息”，“与朝鲜联合国军毫无关系”。但又说：这是“从东京方面的人士得来的”。路透社并把这条透露会议内容的消息摘要重述了一遍。马脚至此全部暴露。谁都知道，能够透露会议内容的所谓“东京方面人士”，除了美国官方之外，不可能有其他人。这个所谓“东京方面人士”，就是路透社记者根据美方授意所写的消息中所指的“此间（东京）权威人士”，显然也就是由于一再在遣返战俘问题上拖延谈判而处于“困难境地”、因而要求举行行政性会议的谈判的李奇微总部及其负责官员。一口咬定说没有透露过会议内容的美国骗子的厚脸皮上，就这样吃了自己的帮凶英国奴才的第二记清脆的耳光。美国侵略者及其帮凶在心慌意乱中所作的这种极端混乱和矛盾百出的谎话，不但没有能掩盖他们的违反协议的行为，相反的，只是在全世界人民面前进一步暴露出美方蓄意阻挠遣返战俘问题的顺利解决、拖延朝鲜停战谈判的罪恶面目。
