Defend the children, and prevent them from suffering any harm! Give the children a happy life!

Every upright person has such a demand; because for everyone, nothing is dearer than his or her children.

But today, children are directly threatened, and war has ravaged many parts of the world; countless mothers, amidst fragmented farmlands and streets of rubble, weep for their little sons and daughters. This should deeply alarm humanity! This is a warning to us, that we should take immediate action to prevent these disasters and sufferings from falling on the heads of children. We know that defending children is first and foremost a matter of maintaining peace.

The most needed thing for ordinary men and women all over the world right now is: they want to live to old age, to raise their children, and to work in a peaceful environment. They firmly maintain that human terror and trauma must be eliminated, and the waste of life and property and the mutilation of children's bodies must not be allowed; but these unfortunate things have already happened twice in this century. People may have different religious beliefs, and may have different political views; they may be workers, writers, machinists, or farmers, but they have a common demand—to make the greatest effort to stop war and defend children!

Broad delegations from various countries, including people from all walks of life, are flocking to Vienna. Their actions are a concrete manifestation of this fervent emotion. They are responding to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation to attend a historic conference in Vienna from April 12th to 16th, with the aim of mobilizing all those who demand the protection of children. They represent hundreds of millions of people to attend the conference; these people believe that peace and the happiness of children are closely linked, and that war is by no means inevitable, but can be completely prevented.

The Vienna conference is of great importance. This is an unprecedented international movement to protect children in human history, and is the first time to take organized action to solve the problem that mothers have been painstakingly worrying about for thousands of years—the fear of war taking their children.

The solution lies first and foremost in mothers in every household rising up against war. When every mother realizes that there are mothers in her neighborhood, district, township, city, and country who have the same strong demand to oppose war, their momentum becomes even stronger. Once mothers all over the world take unified action, not only to stop war, but also to stop the conspiracy of war preparations, their power will gradually reach a climax. Such unified action is entirely possible, because we live in an era of scientific enlightenment, and war can affect everyone, everywhere; therefore, the desire to avoid this disaster is also universally present. The Vienna conference demonstrates this great desire to strive for peace, which is also a major step in solving the problem.

There will certainly be people who openly resist or even attempt to obstruct this strong desire to protect children. They will carry out all kinds of deception. But their every move will only be enough to expose their own ugliness. Because our demands are simple and reasonable. Everyone either supports peace or opposes peace. Therefore, it is easy to determine who is a friend, who is an enemy, who to unite with, and who to fight against.

It is important to draw this line. Even those who are preparing for war must consider the people's yearning for peace. This group of people is shifting their entire economy to war production, driving their people into a state of fear and chaotic madness, and using the terror of the atomic bomb to intimidate children; and all this is done in the name of peace. In international organizations, representatives of certain governments concoct programs that are supposedly aimed at finding peace, but before the ink is dry, they rush off to attend meetings that openly plot war, or transfer their troops and equipment to newly built war bases that are densely packed. For these people, their words and deeds are completely disconnected. However, if there is genuine sincerity for peace, words and deeds must be consistent.

Such people will eventually reveal their true colors. They will inevitably be isolated among the masses, because the masses are unwilling to participate in their despicable conspiracies, and will use all means to oppose their plans to slaughter men, women, and children.

There are also some people who insist that the organized action of mothers all over the world has no effect. They will say: since war is unavoidable, since war is due to human "nature", then we are powerless to do anything about war.

People who say this are pitiful creatures who are easily deceived; they are deceived by those who make a fortune from war, by those who create friction, and by those who are specially trained to undermine the people's peace movement. We must use facts to convince these people. We must point out to them that, relying on the unanimous voices of our hundreds of millions of people, mankind can forever abandon war. We must point out that: humans can only exert their creative power to the fullest and enjoy the happiest life when they live in peace with their neighbors and cooperate with each other.

There is another kind of opposition to the movement to protect children, which comes from a "learned" or "philosophical" point of view. The representatives of this kind of argument drag Malthus out of his grave, attempting to revive his doctrine. They insist that "war is beneficial to mankind, war can reduce 'surplus' population, give more breathing space, and solve the world's food shortage" and so on.

This theory was originally rotten and unbearable. But we must still refute it, because in Western countries, there are still people who believe in it. Many recently published books are still peddling this theory; some very "respected" scholars are still eloquently advocating it in university classrooms, in public forums, and on newspapers and radio broadcasts.

To this group of scholars and those who believe their fallacies, we want to say: Gentlemen, please look around, how can you not see how much mankind has created using their hands and brains! Look at the great progress that mankind has made in the history of the world because of their love for life and peace! Look at how mankind has overcome nature, conquered natural forces, and made it obey the will of mankind! Look at the huge steps that mankind is currently taking! If you cannot see that mankind is resolutely accepting all challenges, solving various problems, and striving forward because they love life; if you cannot see that mankind today possesses knowledge, and with knowledge we can create a happy and cultured life for every man, woman, and child, then you are undoubtedly blind.

We certainly know that: humans have only exploited a little bit of nature's reserves on the earth to maintain life. There is no need to reduce the population on Earth; on the contrary, we really need to increase the population. There is absolutely no "destiny" or "necessity" that governs us, so that our children must suffer from the slaughter of war! On the contrary, we want to protect and nurture our children, so that we can have more hands and brains to further develop our culture.

These are ironclad facts. In the past two years alone, we in China have undoubtedly proven these facts. In the past, there were many "China experts" who insisted that "overpopulation" was the root cause of China's disasters, thereby diverting people's attention and preventing them from seeing that the reason why the Chinese people were in a miserable situation was due to the heavy oppression of feudalism and imperialism; and these "China experts" became famous for this reason. What they talked about with relish was "China's long-term shortage of food." But since the founding of our People's Republic, we have shut their mouths. We have produced enough food to meet the needs of our people, and we have surpluses to export. However, we are still far from agricultural mechanization, and there are still large tracts of land that have not been cultivated! Therefore, facts prove that we can not only feed and clothe the existing population, but we can industrialize and support more people.

Isn't the above-mentioned fact the best explanation of the real reason and solution to the problems that these so-called "China experts" thought were "unsolvable"? Our experience is one that others have had and applies to all countries in the world, it shows that: if a system can only "maintain" itself by plunging the people into poverty and death, then the people's answer is to pronounce its death, while the people themselves are immortal.

We have said a lot about those philosophers who promote decadent ideas and war; they ask mothers not to cry for their children, they think children are "disposable". In fact, no child is disposable. No nation is disposable. Every race and nation has its own major achievements, which have promoted or are promoting the progress of mankind. And today, people of all countries are finally beginning to unite and act in unison for common rights. Do we have any reason to be pessimistic? We have more reason to be optimistic than in the past. There are no insurmountable difficulties for mankind.

So, where is the main threat to our children? Today, our main struggle is to oppose the destructive intentions of a small group of people; this small group of people owns factories, banks, large companies, mines, and workshops, and makes a fortune in war. This small group of people also owns the propaganda tools of their own countries, using these tools to serve their own interests. They control industrial resources and a group of mouthpieces who speak for them. But their power is only superficial. If the people unite for their own interests, this small group of people's enterprises will be paralyzed, their administrative agencies will not be able to continue to rule, and their troops will lose their combat power. They are only powerful when they can deceive the people, but this deception is gradually losing its effectiveness. They are not an unstoppable and irresistible torrent, on the contrary, the people are the mighty Yangtze River, and they are just an insignificant pile of obstacles.

The desires and demands of the vast majority of people cannot be ignored. These desires and demands will only be ineffective when people are isolated from each other, but things are very different once the people unite. This is why our movement to strive for peace and protect children has become the most powerful force in the world. This movement can take away the guns and bombs from those who are preparing for war; this movement can apply atomic energy to the tasks that scientists originally envisioned, helping mankind improve life instead of destroying it.

"Unity is strength". Everyone knows this old saying, and this saying is even more applicable today. People who are willing to strive for peace and security for their children must grasp, understand, and apply this point, and use it as a guide. We must take unified action.

Now, the Women's International Democratic Federation provides every peace-loving person and country with the best opportunity for unified action. The Vienna conference will make people all over the world realize the urgent need to protect our children and the ways to protect children. It is everyone's responsibility to participate in this movement and promote this movement; this should become everyone's most precious cause.

The Chinese people entrusted their delegation to warmly congratulate the Vienna Conference. We hope that the Women's International Democratic Federation will achieve lofty achievements in this great cause of serving mankind. We believe that children everywhere in the world should receive all the happiness that nature has endowed, and all the benefits that human power can create. We hope that all children can grow up to adulthood, that their bodies can be fully developed, and that their minds can receive the most valuable achievements of all mankind; we hope that they will be full of confidence and have no fear of any country, individual, or the future. We want to liberate them from economic crises and from all other natural and man-made disasters.

We hand over the banner of life to the children, and let them hold it high, and continue to move forward on the long journey of human progress. We sincerely believe that if we give the children a head start, they will build a progressive society and culture that makes everyone live happily and pleasantly without harming anyone else. We sincerely hope to give every child such an opportunity. We are fighting for this task, and we believe that the people of all countries will fight with us. This is why the Chinese people demand peace and defend peace.

    保卫儿童
    宋庆龄
    保卫儿童，不使儿童们受到任何伤害！给儿童们以幸福的生活！
    任何一个正直的人都有这样的要求；因为对于每一个人来说，最亲爱的莫过于他的孩子了。
    可是在今天，儿童们正直接受到威胁，世界上好些地方都已遭到战争的浩劫；无数的母亲们，在支离破碎的田园间，在一片瓦砾的街道上，为她们的小儿女伤心流泪。这应当使人类深深警惕了！这是对我们的警告，就是说，我们应当立即行动起来，不让这些灾难和痛苦落在儿童们的头上。我们知道，保卫儿童，首先就是维护和平的问题。
    全世界的普通男女，目前所最需要的一件事情就是：他们要活到老，要抚育他们的小孩子们，要在和平环境中工作。他们坚决主张，必须消除人类的恐怖和创伤，不容许生命和财产的浪费，不容许残害儿童的身体；但这些不幸的事，在这一世纪中却已经有过两次了。人们可能有不同的宗教信仰，可能有不同的政治主张；可能是工人、作家、机工技士，或者庄稼汉，但他们有一个共同的要求——必须尽最大的努力制止战争，保卫儿童！
    广泛的、包括各阶层人士的各国代表团，正纷纷前往维也纳。他们的行动正是这种热烈感情的具体表现。他们响应了国际民主妇女联合会的号召，前往参加在四月十二日至十六日举行的一个历史性的会议，目的是要把所有要求保卫儿童的人们动员起来。他们代表着好几万万的人们来参加会议；这些人们认为和平与儿童的幸福是紧相结合的，认为战争决不是不可避免，而是完全可以制止的。
    维也纳会议关系非常重大。这在人类历史上是保卫儿童的空前的国际性运动，是第一次以有组织的行动来解决数千年来母亲们苦心焦虑的问题——深怕战争夺去她们的孩子的问题。
    解决的办法首先就在于每家每户的母亲们都起来反对战争。当每一个母亲认识到街坊里、区里、乡里、城市里以及全国里，都有一些母亲们，都有同样强烈的反对战争的要求时，她们的声势更壮大起来。一旦全世界的母亲们都采取了一致的行动，不但要制止战争，而且还要制止备战阴谋的时候，她们的威力便逐渐达到高潮了。这样的一致行动是完全可能的，因为我们是生活在一个科学昌明的时代，战争可以影响到每一个人，每一个地方；因此，力求避免这种灾害的愿望，也是普遍存在着的。维也纳的会议，就表现了这个争取和平的伟大愿望，也就是解决问题的一个主要步骤。
    对于这种保卫儿童的强烈愿望，也一定会有人公然抗拒甚至企图阻挠的。他们将进行各种各样的欺骗。但是他们的一举一动都只足以暴露自己的丑态罢了。因为我们的要求是简单而合理的。每一个人，不拥护和平，就反对和平。因此，谁是朋友，谁是敌人，该跟谁团结，该向谁斗争，也就容易确定了。
    划清这种界线是重要的。甚至那些正在准备战争的人们也必须考虑人民对和平的渴望。这批人把他们的整个经济转入战争生产，驱使他们的人民陷于恐惧和混乱的疯狂状态，并用原子弹的恐怖来恐吓儿童们；而这一切都是在和平的名义下进行的。在国际机构里面，某些政府的代表们，胡诌一些据说是觅致和平的纲领，但是墨迹未干，他们却又匆匆忙忙跑去参加公开策划战争的会议，或者调运他们的军队和装备到层层密布的新建的战争基地去了。对于这些人来说，他们的言和行是完全脱节的。但是，如果对于和平真有诚意，就必须言行一致。
    这样的人是终于要原形毕露的。他们必然会在群众中孤立，因为群众不愿意参加他们的卑鄙阴谋，而且要用一切方法来反对他们屠杀男人、妇女和儿童的计划。
    也有这样一些人，他们硬说全世界母亲们有组织的行动没有什么作用。他们会说：既然战争是无法避免的，既然战争是由于人类的“天性”，那末我们对于战争便是无能为力的了。
    说这种话的人是容易受人欺骗的可怜虫；他们受了发战争财的人的骗，受了制造磨擦的人的骗，受了专门训练来破坏人民和平运动的人的骗。我们必须用事实来说服这些人。我们要向他们指出，凭借我们亿万人民万众一心的奔走呼号，人类是能够永远摒弃战争的。我们必须指出：人类只有当他们与邻居和平共处、彼此合作的时候，他们才最能发挥创造的力量，享受最幸福的生活。
    对于保护儿童的运动，还有另外一种反对的意见，那是从“博学的”或“哲学的”见地来发议论的。这类论调的代表人物，把马尔萨斯从坟墓里拉出来，企图复活他的学说。他们硬说“战争对人类有益处，战争可以减少‘过剩’的人口，让出更多的呼吸空间，解决世界的缺粮问题”等等之类。
    这种理论本来是腐臭不堪的了。但是我们还必须予以驳斥，因为在西方国家里面，仍旧有人相信它。最近出版的许多书籍还在贩卖这种理论；有些非常受人“推崇”的学者们，在大学课堂里，在公众讲坛上，在报纸上和无线电广播中，还滔滔不绝地鼓吹它。
    对于这批学者们和那些相信他们的谬论的人们，我们要说：先生们，请四下望望吧，你们怎么没有看见，人类使用他的双手和头脑，创造了多少东西啊！看看人类由于热爱生命与和平、在世界历史上获得的伟大进展吧！看看人类如何战胜自然、征服自然力，使它服从人类意志的情形吧！看看人类目前正在迈进的巨大步伐吧！如果你们看不见人类正因为热爱生命而毅然接受一切的挑战，解决了各种问题，奋力前进；如果你们看不见人类今天已拥有知识，凭借知识我们可以为每一个男人、妇女和儿童创造美满的有文化的生活，那末你们无疑是瞎子了。
    我们确实知道：人类在地球上只不过发掘了自然蕴藏的一点点，就维持了生活。地球上并不需要减少人口；相反，我们实在需要增加人口。绝没有什么“命运”或“必然性”支配我们，使我们的孩子们要遭受战争的杀戮！恰恰相反，我们要保护、抚育我们的孩子们，使我们能有更多的手和脑来进一步发展我们的文化。
    这些都是铁一般的事实。单是在过去的两年里，我们在中国就已经毫无疑义地证明了这些事实。过去有很多“中国通”，硬说“人口过剩”是中国灾祸的根源，从而转移人们的注意，使人看不清楚中国人民之所以陷于悲惨的境遇是由于封建主义和帝国主义的重重压迫；而这些“中国通”竟因此出了名。他们所津津乐道的是“中国长期的缺少粮食”。但是自从我们的人民共和国成立以来，我们就堵住了他们的嘴。我们已经生产了足够的粮食，以满足我国人民的需要，而且还有了剩余，可以输出。然而，我们离开农业机械化还很远，而且还有大块大块的土地没有开垦呢！所以，事实证明：我们不但能够使现有的人口有吃有穿，而且我们能够工业化，能够供养更多的人民。
    这些所谓“中国通”认为“无法解决”的问题，其真正原因和挽救的办法，上述的事实不就是最好的说明吗？我们的这个经验，是别人有过而又适用于世界各国的，它说明了：如果一种制度只有陷人民于贫穷和死亡才能够“维持”的话，那末人民的答复就是宣判它的死亡，而人民自己则是永生的。
    对于那些宣传腐朽思想和战争的哲学家们，我们已经说的很多了；他们要求母亲们不要为自己的孩子们流泪，他们认为孩子们是“可以糟蹋的”。其实，没有哪一个孩子是可以糟蹋的。没有哪一个民族是可以糟蹋的。任何一个种族和民族都有它自己的重大成就，这些成就推动了或正在推动人类的进步。而今天，各国人民为了共同的权利，终于开始团结起来，一致行动。难道我们还有任何理由悲观吗？我们是比过去更有理由乐观了。人类没有不可克服的困难。
    那末，对于我们的孩子们，主要威胁是在什么地方呢？今天，我们最主要的斗争是要反对一小撮人的破坏的意图；这一小撮人占有工厂、银行、大公司、矿山和作坊，而在战争中大发其财。这一小撮人也占有他们自己国家的宣传工具，利用这些工具来为自己的利益服务。他们掌握了工业资源和一批代他们说话的传声筒。但是他们的权力只是虚有其表。如果人民为了自己的利益而团结起来，这一小撮人的企业就要瘫痪了，他们的行政机构就不能继续进行统治，他们的军队也就失掉了战斗的力量。只有当他们还能够欺骗人民的时候，他们才是有力量的，可是这种欺骗也日渐失掉了效力。他们并不是堵塞不住的不可抗拒的巨流，相反，人民才是浩浩荡荡的长江大河，而他们只不过是微不足道的一堆障碍物罢了。
    极大多数人们的愿望和要求，是不能够撇开不管的。这些愿望和要求，只是在人们各自孤立的时候，才不会发生作用，一旦人民团结起来，情形就大不相同了。我们争取和平、保卫儿童的运动之所以成为世界上最强大的力量，其原因就在这里。这个运动能够从那些准备作战的人们手里缴下枪炮和炸弹；这个运动能够把原子能运用到科学家们原先所理想的任务上去，帮助人类提高生活，而不是毁灭人类。
    “团结就是力量”。人人都知道这句老话，这句话在目前更为适用。愿意为孩子们争取和平与安全的人们，必须掌握、了解和运用这一点，把它作为指针。我们必须采取一致行动。
    现在，国际民主妇女联合会，给每一个爱好和平的人士和国家，提供了一个一致行动的最好机会。维也纳的会议，会使全世界人民认识到保卫我们的儿童这一迫切需要和保卫儿童的办法。参加这个运动并推动这个运动，是大家的责任；这应该成为大家最可宝贵的事业。
    中国人民委托他们的代表团，向维也纳会议热烈致贺。我们希望国际民主妇女联合会，在这一个为人类服务的伟大事业中，获得崇高的成就。我们相信，世界各处的儿童们，都应该得到自然所赋予的一切幸福，得到人力所能创造的一切利益。我们希望所有的儿童都能长大成人，身体上能得到充分的发育，精神上能接受全人类最宝贵的成果；希望他们充满信心，对任何国家、个人和未来的一切都无所恐惧。我们要把他们从经济危机中、从其他一切自然的和人为的灾难中，解放出来。
    我们把生命的旗帜交给儿童们，由他们高高举起，在人类进步的长途上，继续迈进。我们衷心相信，如果给孩子们开一个头，他们就会建设一个进步的社会和文化，使每一个人都生活得幸福愉快，而不损害其他任何人。我们衷心希望能给予每个儿童这样一个机会。我们正在为这个任务奋斗，并且相信各国人民必将和我们共同奋斗。中国人民要求和平并保卫和平，其原因就在这里。
