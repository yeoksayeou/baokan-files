    Realizing the Importance of Afforestation for National Construction
    Farmers in Liangcheng, Suiyuan Guarantee to Afforest 40,000 Mu
    Editor: On March 23rd, Liangcheng County, Suiyuan Province, held a county-wide forestry conference. One hundred and six forestry labor models, activists, young women, and enthusiastic old farmers, after heated discussions at the meeting, formulated a work plan for afforestation and forest protection for the entire year and launched a challenge competition to various parts of the province. Because they realized the important significance of forests to national economic construction, they proposed to guarantee the completion of more than 42,000 mu of afforestation and forest protection, 200 mu of nursery cultivation, and 8,152,990 scattered seedlings for the entire year. And they guaranteed a survival rate of over 85 percent. The plan they proposed exceeds the task assigned by the higher authorities by more than five times, is equal to half of the province's annual afforestation task, and they do not request any funding from the government. Liangcheng is a county with a population of only 139,000. Under the conditions of unfavorable climate, barren soil, and a lack of labor and seedlings, they bravely put forward this afforestation plan and guaranteed its completion. We feel that this will be a great encouragement to other regions.

    认识了造林对国家建设的重要性
    绥远凉城农民保证造林四万亩
    编辑同志：三月二十三日，绥远省凉城县召开了全县林业会议。林业劳动模范、积极分子、青年妇女和热心林业工作的老农共一百零六人，在会上经过热烈讨论，订出了今年全年造林护林工作计划，并向全省各地提出挑战竞赛。由于他们认识到森林对国家经济建设的重要意义，所以提出今年全年保证完成造林护林四万二千余亩，育苗二百亩，零星造林八百一十五万二千九百九十苗的任务。并且保证成活率在百分之八十五以上。他们提出的这一计划，超过上级分配的任务的五倍以上，等于全省全年造林任务的半数，并且不向政府要求任何经费。凉城是一个只有十三万九千人口的县份，在气候不良，土质贫瘠和劳力、秧苗缺乏的条件下，勇敢地提出了这个造林计划，并保证完成，我们觉得这对其他地区是会发生很大鼓舞作用的。
