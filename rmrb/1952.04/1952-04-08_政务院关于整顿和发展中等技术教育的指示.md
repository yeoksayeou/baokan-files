    Directive of the Government Administration Council on Rectifying and Developing Secondary Technical Education
    Our country is actively preparing for large-scale economic construction. Training technical personnel is a necessary condition for national economic construction, and the large-scale training and cultivation of intermediate and primary technical personnel is particularly urgent. According to preliminary estimates from all sides, the national economic construction will require approximately 500,000 intermediate and primary technical cadres in about five or six years. The existing secondary technical schools in our country are far from meeting this need in terms of quantity and quality. To this end, people's governments at all levels should lead relevant departments to actively rectify and develop secondary technical education in order to solve the urgent need for intermediate and primary technical cadres for national construction.
    The "Decision on the Reform of the School System" promulgated by this Council on October 1, 1951, has clearly stipulated the position of secondary technical schools in the school system. Its task is to train intermediate and primary technical personnel in industry, agriculture, transportation, and other fields, divided into technical schools (equivalent to senior high school level) and junior technical schools (equivalent to junior high school level) according to degree, and has respectively stipulated their length of study and enrollment conditions. In addition to implementing this decision, people's governments at all levels should, based on the following principles, rectify and develop secondary technical education in a planned and step-by-step manner:
    (1) In order to meet the current urgent need of the state for technical cadres and to complete the task of training a large number of technical cadres for the state in a timely manner, the work of rectifying and developing secondary technical education at this stage must be carried out by relevant business departments of people's governments at all levels, as well as major industrial and mining enterprises and farms, under the guidance, assistance, and unified planning of the education departments of people's governments at all levels, with everyone participating and cooperating. In terms of school-running policy, we must grasp the characteristics of the initial stage of revolutionary construction and adopt revolutionary methods. In addition to rectifying and developing regular technical schools, we should also run various short-term technical training classes according to actual needs, or attach various amateur technical supplementary classes or training classes to industrial and mining enterprises, farms, and technical schools, so as to appropriately coordinate the development of regular, short-term, and amateur technical schools or training classes. The school buildings and equipment of technical schools should be practical and suitable, not afraid of being simple and crude, and the staffing and financial expenditures should be streamlined and economical, avoiding extravagance and waste. The curriculum and teaching materials should be streamlined and focused, and the teaching methods should be as practical as possible, so as to achieve the goal of not only completing the task of rapidly training a large number of technical cadres, but also appropriately maintaining the necessary level of secondary technical education.
    (2) All types and levels of secondary technical schools should, according to the specific needs of various business departments, clearly stipulate their policies and tasks, and gradually and appropriately implement specialization and simplification, so as to ensure consistency between learning and application, and that the personnel trained are truly suitable for the needs of various business departments. In addition to giving students specialized technical training, secondary technical schools must also implement political education and basic cultural and scientific knowledge education. Therefore, the curriculum of all types and levels of secondary technical schools should include general courses, technical courses, and experiments and internships, to correct and prevent the tendency of focusing solely on technology and neglecting political and cultural studies. The subjects of general courses and the proportion of general courses to technical courses should be stipulated separately according to the nature of the school, the level of students, and the length of study. Schools must establish close ties with relevant factories, mines, farms, etc., and attach importance to internal and external experiments and internships. The time for experiments and internships should be roughly equal to the teaching hours of technical courses. Existing secondary technical schools in various regions should, in accordance with the above principles, appropriately adjust their departments and improve their teaching content and methods to meet the needs of national construction.
    (3) All types and levels of secondary technical schools should be led by the education departments of people's governments at all levels and relevant business departments under a unified policy. Issues concerning the educational policy, system, general curriculum teaching plan, national overall establishment plan, and enrollment plan of secondary technical schools, as well as other educational principles, should be decided by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government (except for technical schools in the military system). The education departments of local people's governments should, in accordance with the decisions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, lead the secondary technical schools in their respective regions to implement them. The establishment, change, suspension, departmentalization, enrollment, business courses, experiments and internships, financial expenditures, personnel allocation, graduate distribution, and other daily administrative matters of secondary technical schools should, in principle, be directly decided by the relevant business departments. In the future, the establishment of new secondary technical schools in various regions should be handled in accordance with the above principles; the original secondary technical schools (including private ones) that are currently under the leadership of the education departments should adjust their leadership relations in a planned and prepared manner in accordance with the above principles; before the leadership relations are changed, transitional measures should also be taken to strengthen the connection between the business departments and the technical schools. In order to strengthen the leadership of secondary technical schools, the education departments of the central, greater administrative region, and provincial (municipal) people's governments and the relevant business departments at the same level should designate personnel to organize secondary technical education committees at all levels to be responsible for studying and solving major issues related to secondary technical education. The organizational regulations of secondary technical education committees at all levels will be formulated separately. The relevant business departments of the central, greater administrative region, and provincial (municipal) people's governments, which have more educational affairs, should strengthen or add institutions for managing technical education; those with fewer educational affairs should also set up full-time personnel to effectively manage this educational work.
    (4) All types and levels of secondary technical schools should systematically enroll industrial workers, cadres who have participated in the revolution for many years, and peasant labor models with considerable cultural levels, and train them to become technical cadres for national production and construction. Various conveniences and necessary preferential treatment should be given to their enrollment. All agencies, organizations, factories, mines, and farms should proceed from the long-term interests of national construction and conscientiously select the above-mentioned personnel to study in secondary technical schools.
    (5) The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and relevant business departments should immediately begin the work of compiling and reviewing textbooks for general courses and technical courses in secondary technical schools. The education department should be mainly responsible for the compilation and review of textbooks for general courses, and the relevant business departments should be mainly responsible for the compilation and review of textbooks for technical courses, but they should maintain contact with each other in their work. Various business departments should also mobilize a certain number of technical personnel from factories, mines, farms, etc., to teach at nearby secondary technical schools. These part-time teachers should be remunerated according to the school's regulations.
    (6) The funding of secondary technical schools should be resolved at different levels in accordance with the three-level financial system. The relevant business departments of the central, greater administrative region, and provincial (municipal) people's governments should include technical education funds as part of their construction funds in their budgets.
    (7) The distribution of graduates from secondary technical schools in various regions should first satisfy the needs of the local competent business departments, and the central government should make appropriate adjustments when necessary.
    (8) The existing private secondary technical schools and private technical supplementary schools in various regions can play a certain role in training technical personnel. People's governments at all levels and their subordinate relevant business departments should encourage the establishment of such schools and strengthen their leadership to effectively serve national construction. Those who have achieved good results in running schools but have real financial difficulties should be given appropriate subsidies.
    (9) This directive also applies to medical and other secondary specialized schools (trade, banking, cooperation, art, etc.) stipulated in Section 3, Item 3 of the "Decision on the Reform of the School System" of this Council.
    (10) The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government should, in accordance with this directive, jointly with the relevant business departments of the Central People's Government, formulate a national plan for the establishment and enrollment of secondary technical schools and submit it to this Council for approval and implementation.
                                         Premier  Zhou Enlai
                                    March 31, 1952

    政务院关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示
    我们的国家正在积极地准备进行大规模的经济建设。培养技术人材是国家经济建设的必要条件，而大量地训练与培养中级和初级技术人材尤为当务之急。根据各方面的初步估计，在五六年内，全国经济建设约需中级和初级技术干部五十万人左右。我国现有的中等技术学校，在数量与质量上，均远不能适应此种需要。为此，各级人民政府应领导各有关部门共同积极整顿与发展中等技术教育，以解决国家建设所迫切需要的中级和初级技术干部问题。
    一九五一年十月一日本院公布的“关于改革学制的决定”已明确规定了中等技术学校在学校系统中的地位，其任务为培养工业、农业、交通、运输等方面的中级和初级技术人材，按程度分为技术学校（相当高级中学程度）和初级技术学校（相当初级中学程度），并已分别规定其修业年限和招生条件。各级人民政府除遵照此项决定施行外，并应根据下述方针，对中等技术教育进行有计划有步骤的整顿与发展：
    （一）为满足目前国家对技术干部的迫切需要，及时完成为国家培养大量技术干部的任务，现阶段整顿和发展中等技术教育的工作，必须由各级人民政府有关业务部门以及各主要工矿企业和农场，在各级人民政府教育部门的指导协助和统一计划下，大家动手分工合作来共同进行。在办学方针上，必须掌握革命建设初期的特点，采取革命的办法。除整顿和发展正规的技术学校外，还应根据实际需要举办各种速成性质的技术训练班，或在各工矿企业农场中以及各技术学校中附设各种业余性质的技术补习班或训练班，务使正规的、速成的、业余的各种技术学校或训练班得到适当的配合发展。技术学校的校舍和设备，应力求朴实合用，不怕因陋就简，编制和经费开支应力求精简节约，切忌铺张浪费，课程教材应注意精简集中，教学方法应尽量切合实际，以期做到既能完成迅速培养大量技术干部的任务，又能适当保持中等技术教育必需的水平。
    （二）各类各级中等技术学校，均应根据各业务部门的具体需要，明确规定其方针与任务，并逐步地与适当地实行专业化与单一化，务求学用一致，使所培养的人材确能适合各业务部门的需要。中等技术学校除给学生以专门的技术训练外，并须实施政治教育和基本的文化与科学知识教育。因此，各类各级中等技术学校的课程应包括普通课、技术课及实验实习，纠正与防止单学技术忽视政治、文化学习的偏向。普通课的科目以及普通课与技术课所占的比重，应根据学校的性质、学生程度和修业年限分别规定。学校必须与有关的工厂、矿山、农场等建立密切联系，重视校内和校外的实验与实习，实验实习的时间应与技术课的讲授时数大体相等。各地现有的中等技术学校，均应按照上述原则，适当进行科别的调整和教学内容与方法的改进，使切合国家建设的需要。
    （三）各类各级中等技术学校应在统一的方针下，由各级人民政府教育部门与各有关业务部门分工领导。关于中等技术学校的教育方针、制度、普通课程教学计划、全国总的设置计划和招生计划以及其他有关教育原则方面的问题，应由中央人民政府教育部决定（军事系统的技术学校除外），各地方人民政府的教育部门，应根据中央人民政府教育部的决定，领导各该地区的中等技术学校予以贯彻实施。关于中等技术学校的设置、变更、停办、分科、招生、业务课程、实验实习、经费开支、人事配备、毕业生的分配以及其他日常行政事宜等，应以分别由各有关业务部门直接决定为原则。今后各地新设中等技术学校，均应遵照上述原则办理；原有中等技术学校（包括私立者在内）中现归教育部门领导者，则应遵照上述原则有步骤和有准备地调整其领导关系；在领导关系未变更前亦应采取过渡办法，以加强业务部门与技术学校的联系。为加强对中等技术学校的领导，应由中央、大行政区及省
    （市）人民政府教育部门与同级各有关业务部门指定人员分别组织各级中等技术教育委员会，负责研讨和解决各项有关中等技术教育的重大问题。各级中等技术教育委员会组织条例另订之。中央、大行政区及省（市）人民政府的有关业务部门，其教育事务较多者，均应加强或增设管理技术教育的机构；其教育事务较少者，亦应设置专职人员，切实掌管此项教育工作。
    （四）各类各级中等技术学校应有计划地吸收有相当文化程度的产业工人、参加革命多年的干部和农民劳动模范入学，培养他们成为国家生产建设的技术干部，对他们的入学应给以种种便利和必要的优待。各机关、团体、工厂、矿山、农场均应从国家建设的长远利益着眼，认真地选送上述人员入中等技术学校学习。
    （五）中等技术学校普通课和技术课的教材，中央人民政府教育部及有关业务部门应即着手进行编审工作。教育部门应主要负责普通课教材的编审工作，各有关业务部门应主要负责技术课教材的编审工作，但应在工作上互相取得联系。各业务部门并应动员一定数量的工厂、矿山、农场等方面的技术人员到附近的中等技术学校教课。对这类的兼职教员，均应按学校的规定给予报酬。
    （六）中等技术学校的经费，应按三级财政制度，分层负责解决。中央、大行政区及省（市）人民政府的有关业务部门应将技术教育经费作为建设资金的一部分列入自己的预算。
    （七）各地中等技术学校毕业生的分配，应尽先满足地方主管业务部门的需要，必要时由中央作适当的调剂。
    （八）各地现有的各类私立中等技术学校和私立技术补习学校，对培养技术人材能起一定的作用，各级人民政府及所属各有关业务部门应鼓励此类学校的设置，并加强领导，使其有效地为国家建设服务。其办理有成绩而经费确实困难者，应予以适当的补助。
    （九）本指示对于本院“关于改革学制的决定”第三项丁目第三节所规定的医药及其他中等专业学校（贸易、银行、合作、艺术等）同样适用。
    （十）中央人民政府教育部应根据本指示，会同中央人民政府各有关业务部门，拟订全国中等技术学校的设置和招生计划，报请本院批准施行。
                                         总理  周恩来
                                    一九五二年三月三十一日
