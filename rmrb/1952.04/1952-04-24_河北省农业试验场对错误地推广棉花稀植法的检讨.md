    Hebei Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station's Self-Criticism Regarding the Erroneous Promotion of Sparse Planting of Cotton

    To the Editor: The People's Daily criticism on February 11th pointed out that many agricultural leadership organs in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province last year failed to implement the resolution of the North China Agricultural Technology Conference regarding wide ridges and dense planting, blindly promoting sparse planting, which led to reduced cotton production. We believe this criticism is correct. Our station bears the responsibility of agricultural technical guidance, but due to conservative thinking and sticking to old methods in our work, we did not do enough in accepting advanced experience, we did not improve in experimental research, and even when summarizing the experiences of labor models, we failed to analyze and criticize their experiences. Now we will conduct the following self-criticism regarding our work:

    I. In terms of experimental research: The 1950 dense planting experiment was flawed in design, and fertilization and watering were insufficient, so the yield of dense planting was limited. Because the dense planting experiment did not yield a definitive conclusion, we could not provide clear direction in technical guidance.

    II. When summarizing the cotton bumper harvest survey in 1950, we were misled by the notion that "most high-yield households practice sparse planting." As a result, we failed to implement the resolution of the North China Agricultural Technology Conference regarding wide ridges and dense planting. Instead, we uncritically summarized the materials from the agricultural labor model symposium into the erroneous conclusion that "the trend from dense to sparse is very obvious."

    III. In terms of promotion: Our station advocated sparse planting in both 1949 and 1950. Although we did not continue to mobilize cotton farmers to practice sparse planting in 1951, our technical guidance ideology was biased, and in reality, we still promoted the development of the sparse planting trend. The trend of sparse planting indeed still existed in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City and the Shijiazhuang Special Zone in 1951; we should bear certain responsibility for the creation of these errors.

    Based on the report of the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Technology Cadre Visiting Group's visit to Qu Yaoli's cotton field and the Central Ministry of Agriculture's Directly Subordinate Mechanized Farming School's cotton dense planting experiment, and the results of our station's 1951 dense planting experiment, we have deeply recognized the benefits of dense planting—fast seedling growth, more bolls per mu, high yield, and early maturity. In the future, in order to implement the correct direction of dense planting, starting in 1952, we will cultivate varieties suitable for dense planting in breeding, seek cultivation and management methods suitable for dense planting in cultivation, and reverse public opinion and vigorously promote it in promotion. At present, in cotton-growing areas planting Si Zi Cotton No. 2 and No. 4, planting 3,000 to 4,000 plants per mu is appropriate. Hebei can flexibly adjust within this range based on specific circumstances.

### 河北省农业试验场对错误地推广棉花稀植法的检讨

    河北省农业试验场对错误地推广棉花稀植法的检讨
    编辑同志：二月十一日人民日报批评去年河北省产棉区很多农业领导机关，没有执行华北农业技术会议关于宽垅密植的决议，盲目地推广稀植，使棉花减产的错误。我们认为这个批评是正确的。我场负有农业技术指导的责任，但由于思想保守，工作上老一套，以致在接受先进经验方面作得很不够，在试验研究方面没有改进，甚至在总结劳动模范经验时，对他们的经验也未能加以分析批判。现在我们就本场工作作以下检讨：
    一、在试验研究方面：一九五零年的密植试验，因设计错误，施肥、浇水都嫌不够，所以密植的产量也受到限制。因为密植试验没有得到肯定的结论，所以在技术指导上就提不出明确的方向。
    二、在总结一九五零年棉花丰产调查时，受了
    “凡丰产户大都是稀植”的迷惑，因此也就没有贯彻华北农业技术会议关于宽垅密植的决议，反而把农业劳动模范座谈的材料不加批判地总结为“从密到稀的趋势是很明显的”的错误结论。
    三、在推广方面：本场一九四九年和一九五零年都曾提倡稀植，一九五一年虽然没有继续动员棉农稀植，但由于我们在技术指导思想上有偏差，实际上则仍然助长了稀植趋势的发展。一九五一年石家庄市郊及石家庄专区的稀植风气确实仍存在；这些错误的造成，我们应负一定的责任。
    根据去年河北省农业技术干部参观团参观曲耀离的棉花和中央农业部直属机耕学校实习农场棉花密植试验的报告，和本场一九五一年密植试验的结果，我们已经深刻认识到密植的好处——苗期生长快，每亩结铃数多、丰产、早熟。今后为了贯彻密植的正确方向，自一九五二年起，在育种上我们要培育适于密植的品种，在栽培上要寻求适于密植的栽培管理方法，在推广上也要扭转群众思想，大力推广。目前在种植斯字棉二号、四号的棉区，以每亩植三千至四千棵为恰当。河北各地可根据具体情况，在此范围内灵活地加以调节。
