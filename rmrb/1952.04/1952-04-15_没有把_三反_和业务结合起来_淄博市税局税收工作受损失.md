    Failing to Combine the "Three Antis" with Professional Work
    Zibo City Tax Bureau Suffers Losses in Tax Revenue Work

    To the Editors: During the "Three Antis" campaign, the leading cadres of the Zibo City People's Government Tax Bureau in Shandong Province concentrated all the cadres in the city bureau, leaving only one or two new comrades in the tax offices to support the work. As a result, in February, only 36% to 74% of the temporary commercial tax, stamp tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes were collected; in March, only slightly less than 53% of the total tax revenue was collected. The 1951 income tax final settlement is now underway, which is a rather heavy and complex task, requiring a large number of cadres to complete. We suggest that the Zibo City Tax Bureau, in the spirit of combining the "Three Antis" with professional work, quickly reallocate cadres and bring the professional work back on track.

    没有把“三反”和业务结合起来
    淄博市税局税收工作受损失
    编辑同志：山东淄博市人民政府税务局的领导干部，在“三反”期间，把全部干部都集中到市局，只留一、二个新同志在税务所支持工作，以致二月份的临商税、印花税、屠宰税等只完成百分之三十六至七十四；三月份全部税收只完成百分之五十三弱。现在正进行一九五一年所得税汇算清缴工作，这是一项相当繁重复杂的工作，必须集中大批干部，才能完成任务。我们建议淄博市税务局本着“三反”和业务相结合的精神，从速调配干部，把业务工作纳入正轨。　高玮　张武斌
