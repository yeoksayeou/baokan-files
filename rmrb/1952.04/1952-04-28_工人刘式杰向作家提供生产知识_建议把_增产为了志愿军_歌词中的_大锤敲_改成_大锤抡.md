    Worker Liu Shijie Provides Production Knowledge
    Suggests Changing "Hammer Blow" to "Hammer Swing" in the Lyrics of "Increase Production for the Volunteer Army"
    Editor: In order to celebrate our holiday—"May Day" International Labor Day, we are now using our spare time to learn some songs. During the learning process, we feel that there is a problem with the song "Increase Production for the Volunteer Army," with lyrics by Yuan Shuipai and music by Guo Naian. The problem is in the fifth line of the first verse: "Big hammer goes 'bang'! Small hammer goes 'tap'! Every hammer blow smashes the American wolf!" The word "bang" (敲 - qiāo) in "Big hammer goes 'bang'!" is inappropriate. It would be acceptable to say "Big hammer hits" and "Small hammer taps." But for a big hammer, using the word "bang" (敲 - qiāo) is weak. It's like watching someone else swing the big hammer. Workers are actively producing to build and defend our beloved motherland and to support "the most beloved people" [referring to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army]. In winter, we work in thin clothes; in summer, the flames and red-hot iron cause sweat to drip onto the red iron, making a "sizzling" sound. This shows that swinging the big hammer is a very strenuous task. In order to sing with strength and to encourage people to take action, I think it is better to change the word "bang" (敲 - qiāo) to "swing" (抡 - lūn). Whether or not swinging a big hammer is powerful depends on how well you swing the hammer. The higher and more circular you swing, the greater the force.
    Worker Liu Shijie

    Comrade Yuan Shuipai's Reply
    Editor: Comrade Liu Shijie's suggestion is correct. I am very grateful to him. When I wrote "Big hammer goes 'bang'! Small hammer goes 'tap'!" in the lyrics of this song, I did not carefully consider the differences in the actions of using a big hammer and a small hammer. This is because I did not delve deeply into life and understand life. Comrade Liu Shijie's change of the word "bang" (敲 - qiāo) to "swing" (抡 - lūn) not only makes the content of the lyrics conform to reality, but also makes the sentence more vivid and powerful. His explanation makes an author deeply feel the importance of going deep into life and experiencing life. I hope that comrades who sing this song will change the word "bang" (敲 - qiāo) to "swing" (抡 - lūn).

### 工人刘式杰向作家提供生产知识  建议把“增产为了志愿军”歌词中的“大锤敲”改成“大锤抡”

    工人刘式杰向作家提供生产知识
    建议把“增产为了志愿军”歌词中的“大锤敲”改成“大锤抡”
    编辑同志：为了庆祝我们的节日——“五一”国际劳动节，现在我们正利用休息时间学习几个歌子。在学习当中，我们觉得，袁水拍作词、郭乃安作曲的“增产为了志愿军”歌子中有一个毛病，就是第一段第五句“大锤那个敲嘿！小锤那个打嘿！锤锤打的美国狼！”中的“大锤那个敲”的“敲”字是不合适的。说“大锤打”“小锤敲”还可以。对大锤来说，用“敲”字是无力的，是以旁观者的立场看打大锤。工人们为了建设和保卫我们可爱的祖国，积极生产，支援“我们最可爱的人”。在冬天，我们穿着单衣工作；在夏天，火焰和红铁烤得汗珠掉到红铁上“吱吱”直响，可见打大锤是非常吃力的工作。为了唱起来有力，为了鼓舞人们行动，我认为把“敲”字改为“抡”字较好。因为打大锤有劲没劲，要看把锤抡得怎么样，抡得越高越圆，劲头就越大。
    工人  刘式杰
    袁水拍同志的答复
    编辑同志：刘式杰同志所提的意见是正确的。我十分感谢他。我在这首歌词里写“大锤敲”“小锤打”这一句的时候，并没有仔细推敲使用大锤和小锤在动作上有什么区别。这是由于我没有深入生活、了解生活之故。刘式杰同志把“敲”字改为“抡”字，不但使歌词内容符合了实际，并且使句子变得生动，有力了。他所作的解释，使一个作者深深感到深入生活、体验生活的重要性。我希望唱这首歌曲的同志们都把“敲”字改为“抡”字。
