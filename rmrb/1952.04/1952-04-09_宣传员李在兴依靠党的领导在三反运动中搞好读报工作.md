Propagandist Li Zaixing Relies on Party Leadership to Improve Newspaper Reading Work in the Three-Anti Movement

　　Comrade Li Zaixing is a propagandist and head of the newspaper reading group at the No. 2 Cloth Shoe Factory in Harbin. During the Three-Anti Movement, he was known throughout the factory as a "propaganda expert." How did he carry out propaganda? The most important method was to use the powerful weapon of newspapers. He believed that newspapers had the richest and most timely content. He used newspapers for propaganda, which improved the class consciousness of all workers in the group, made the workers realize the great significance of the Three-Anti Movement, thereby boosting everyone's enthusiasm for struggle, and enabling the group to win the glorious title of "Red Flag Group" in production.

　　Li Zaixing's newspaper reading group was established in the second half of last year. But it did not play its due role at that time. The reason was that newspaper reading was not combined with the central movement. For example, after Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, workers worked hard to tap potential and find tricks. They generally wanted to know about advanced experiences elsewhere to inspire their own wisdom. However, Li Zaixing only read other articles. Everyone felt bored and said that listening to him was not as good as doing something else! There was also no system for reading newspapers. Sometimes they read, sometimes they didn't, and fewer and fewer people listened.

　　After the start of the Three-Anti Movement, the factory's Party, Youth League, and Trade Union held a special meeting to improve the work of the newspaper reading group, put forward many improvement measures, and strengthened Li Zaixing and the masses' confidence in newspaper reading and learning. The meeting decided that the Party branch should strengthen its leadership over newspaper reading, and guide the newspaper reading group to select appropriate materials to read according to the ideological situation of the masses in the Three-Anti Movement. When the Three-Anti Movement entered the stage of denunciation, many people had ideological concerns. Some people said, "They dare not retaliate now, but what if they retaliate in the future?" The newspaper reading group used typical events in the newspaper to repeatedly explain to everyone, and organized everyone to chat at any time. Some people said, "What are we afraid of with Chairman Mao supporting us this time?" Others said, "Meng Qinggui denounced corrupt elements and was not only not retaliated against, but also received praise from higher authorities." Old worker Wang Yongshan knew that Zhao Guoli was a corrupt and thief, but he never dared to speak out before. After reading the newspaper, his understanding improved, and he said angrily, "Corrupt elements are like rat spirits. They steal from our production. If we don't dig them out, how can our movement to increase production and practice economy be carried out well?" He immediately denounced Zhao Guoli's illegal acts. When besieging the big "tigers," some confusing thoughts arose among the masses. Li Quan said, "Fighting big 'tigers' is a matter for cadres, it has nothing to do with us workers!" Some said, "We make shoes all day long, how do we know who the big 'tiger' is?" Some people saw the big corrupt elements "crying" and "acting crazy," and their hearts softened. They said, "It's almost enough!" Under the guidance of the Party branch, Li Zaixing selected and read the article "Must Fight a Decisive Battle" and organized discussions in a planned way, so that everyone realized the "tricks" of the corrupt elements, and unanimously concluded: "Fighting 'tigers' is a complex battle, and we must not waver or be paralyzed!" The next day, the workers automatically launched a wave of finding clues, directly helping the work of the "tiger" fighting team. Worker Jiang Qing heard a clue about a corrupt element in a certain factory, immediately investigated, and reported it to the organization in a timely manner. This corruption case was finally solved.

　　Through newspaper reading, Li Zaixing mobilized the worker comrades to participate in the anti-corruption struggle, making everyone realize the rampant nature of the bourgeoisie's attack on us, and greatly improving the workers' class consciousness. To express their heartfelt support for the "Three-Anti" Movement, the worker comrades also compiled various lyrics, such as "Anti is good, anti is wonderful, resolutely uproot the old roots of the bourgeois attack," and so on, to carry out propaganda everywhere. The workers' enthusiasm for production has also increased, and they have all expressed their desire to be heroes on the production front. Worker Zhang Yucheng used to make at most one and a half shoe soles a day, but now he has increased it to two and a half, and the quality has also been greatly improved. The production volume of the Li Zaixing group in February exceeded the target by 15 percent.

    宣传员李在兴依靠党的领导在三反运动中搞好读报工作
    李在兴同志是哈尔滨布鞋第二厂的宣传员兼读报组长。在三反运动中，他被全厂称为“宣传能手”。他怎样进行宣传呢？最主要的方法是运用报纸这一有力武器。他认为报纸的内容最丰富、最及时，他运用报纸进行宣传，使全组工人在运动中提高了阶级觉悟，使工人认识到三反运动的伟大意义，从而鼓舞了大家斗争的积极性，并使该组在生产上获得了“红旗小组”的光荣称号。
    李在兴的读报组是去年下半年建立起来的。但当时没有起了应有的作用。原因是读报没有和中心运动相结合。比如毛主席提出增产节约的号召后，工人们努力挖潜力、找窍门，他们普遍要求知道别处的先进经验，以启发自己的智慧。可是李在兴却尽读些别的文章。大家感到枯燥无味，都说听他的还不如自己干点别的事咧！读报也没有什么制度，有时念，有时不念，听报的人越来越少。
    三反运动开始后，该厂党、青年团和工会为搞好读报组工作，专门开过一次会，提出了许多改进办法，加强了李在兴和群众对读报学习的信心。会议决定由党支部加强对读报的领导，根据三反运动中的群众思想情况，指导读报组选读恰合时宜的材料。当三反运动进入检举阶段时，许多人思想上有顾虑。有人说：“现在他们不敢报复，将来报复怎么办？”读报组就用报纸上的典型事件，反复向大家解释，并随时组织大家漫谈。有人说：“这回有毛主席给撑腰怕什么？”也有的说：“孟庆贵检举了贪污分子，不但未受到报复，而且得到了上级的表扬。”老工人王永山知道赵国利是个贪污盗窃分子，在先总不敢讲。读报后，他的认识提高了，气愤地说：“贪污分子像个老鼠精，咱们生产他就往外盗，再不挖掉他，咱的增产节约运动还能搞好？”他当场检举了赵国利的违法事实。当围攻大“老虎”时，群众中又产生了一些混乱思想。李全会说：“打大‘老虎’是干部的事，与咱工人没关系！”有的说：“咱一天到晚管做鞋，知道谁是大‘老虎’？”有人看见大贪污分子“哭哭啼啼”、“装疯卖傻”，就心软了，他们说：“斗得差不多了！”李在兴在党支部的指导下，选读“必须打歼灭战”那篇文章，有计划地组织讨论，使大家认识到贪污分子的“花招”，并一致得出结论：“打‘老虎’是个复杂的仗，决不能动摇麻痹！”第二天，工人就自动地掀起了找线索的热潮，直接帮助了打“虎”队的工作。工人蒋庆听到某厂一个贪污分子的线索，立即进行调查，并及时反映给组织，这件贪污案终于破案了。
    李在兴通过读报，发动了工人同志参加反贪污斗争，使大家认识到资产阶级向我们进攻的猖狂性，大大地提高了工人的阶级觉悟。工人同志们为表示对“三反”运动的衷心拥护，还编成了各种的歌词，如“反得好，反得妙，坚决把资产阶级进攻的老根来拔掉”等等，到处进行宣传。工人们的生产劲头也更大了，都表示要当生产战线上的英雄。工人张玉成过去每天顶多做一只半鞋底，现在则提高到二只半，质量也大大改进了。李在兴小组二月份的生产量超额完成百分之十五。
