    A True Record
    ——Attending the Moscow International Economic Conference
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    The speeches of the representatives of various countries at the Moscow International Economic Conference left us with a strong impression: the people's lives in socialist and people's democratic countries are so prosperous and thriving, while the people's lives in other countries are so difficult and miserable.
    This conference explored the possibilities of improving people's living conditions related to the development of international trade.
    In the speeches of the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, we learned about the rapid progress of industry, agriculture, transportation, and trade, and heard the happy rhythm of people's lives. Unemployment disappeared in the Soviet Union twenty years ago, and it has basically been resolved in China today. Before the conference, the Soviet Union had just made its fifth post-war price reduction, and during the conference, news of China's price reduction also arrived.
    Representatives from other countries provided completely opposite phenomena in their speeches. These phenomena are inextricably linked to the capitalist system, and they are aggravated by the intensified arms expansion of the US imperialist bloc. The obstruction of normal international trade further worsens this situation.
    The first widespread phenomenon is unemployment. Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, said at the meeting: 18 million Japanese workers are either fully or partially unemployed; in Western European countries, namely West Germany, Italy, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Denmark, the number of fully unemployed workers has increased from 6.2 million last year to 7.6 million in February this year, and the number of partially unemployed workers is even greater. According to Italian representatives G. Rovida (Senator, Secretary-General of the Metalworkers' Union), B. Manzocchi (Economist, Director of the Economic Magazine), and L. Amaduzzi (Director of the Economic Department of the General Confederation of Labor), the unemployment problem in Italy is serious. Fifteen percent of the labor force is unemployed. Italy has 2 million fully unemployed workers, 2 million partially unemployed workers, and millions more unemployed agricultural workers. According to French representative Lebrun, from October 1951 to March 1952, the number of fully unemployed workers in France increased by more than 50 percent. The phenomenon of unemployment among civilian industrial workers is also serious in the United States. According to US representative Dacy (member of the AFL Printing Trades Union): "From November 1950 to November 1951, 103,000 workers in the automobile industry were unemployed, and 115,000 workers in the textile industry were laid off. The Department of Labor predicts that 400,000 workers in the construction industry will be laid off this year."
    The second widespread phenomenon is the decline in labor compensation and the rise in the cost of living. Saillant cited examples: the average annual income of a person in Indonesia is only $30, in the Philippines - $44, in Pakistan - $51, in Kenya, East Africa - £6, and in Northern Rhodesia, South Africa - £5. Saillant quoted official figures announced by various countries on the increase in the cost of living index from July 1950 to December 1951: Austria - 47 percent, Australia - 43 percent, France - 28 percent, Japan - 24 percent, Argentina - 22 percent, Britain - 13 percent, Brazil - 11 percent, the United States - 10 percent, Pakistan - 9 percent, etc. Japanese representative Takaoka Tomi said: In Japan, wages are only 81 to 85 percent of pre-war levels, while food prices have increased by 437 percent compared to pre-war levels, textile prices - 444 percent, and industrial product prices - 150 percent. Dutch representative B. Brandsen (Secretary-General of the Dutch Trade Union Federation) said: "In the Netherlands, the expansion of armaments is sacrificing the interests of workers and completely disintegrating the peaceful economy. For military purposes, every Dutchman, from children to the elderly, now has to pay an average of four guilders per week."
    The third widespread phenomenon is that ordinary people cannot get enough to eat. In Japan, according to Japanese representative Takaoka Tomi: "The average standard for eating is set at 2,500 calories per person per day, but in reality, in 1947 it was only 1,535 calories, in July 1951 - 1,089 calories, and in January 1952 - 806 calories." Indian representative Prem Sagar Gupta (Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress) said that in India, "not having enough to eat is a common phenomenon for all workers, with a food intake of only 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day, while the requirement is 3,700 calories." Indonesian representative Lenturamipi said: In Indonesia, "the staple food of the people - rice - is not enough. People eat rice once every two days, sometimes once every three days." French representative Lebrun said: "In France, the working class's inability to get enough to eat is an urgent problem. As for the residents of Black Africa and French North Africa, the hunger problem is very acute."
    The fourth widespread phenomenon is the lack of housing. Saillant said: "The housing problem is also a serious problem for the majority of the working population worldwide. France is short of 5 million houses, West Germany is short of 6 million, and 4 million Italians live in dilapidated houses." British representative Stanley mentioned in his speech that Britain lacks steel due to military expansion, and is unable to import enough timber from the East due to external pressure, so the housing shortage is serious. Dutch representative Brandsen said that there are currently more than 300,000 families in the Netherlands without housing. Indian representative Gupta said: "In Bombay, more than 300,000 people have no houses to live in and have to sleep on the streets. A small room sometimes houses ten to twenty workers, and sometimes several families live in one room." Pakistani representative Choudhury (Member of Parliament, Landlord) said: "Because of the housing shortage in the big cities of Pakistan, even now there are still millions of people living on the streets or in small broken houses without houses." Paraguayan representative Acosta said: "The people are suffering from an acute housing shortage, and often twenty people live in one room."
    The above-mentioned situation reflected at this conference is only a small part related to international trade, but its severity can already be seen. One of the root causes of this tragic situation is the policy of arms expansion and reduction of civilian production by the US and British ruling groups. According to Saillant's speech, 93 percent of the lathes in the capitalist countries are now used in the arms industry. And the policy of the US ruling group to hinder trade between Eastern and Western countries has aggravated this tragic situation. Saillant said that the restriction of Japan's trade with China is one of the reasons why its number of unemployed has reached as high as 18 million.
    At this conference, representatives of various countries unanimously agreed that the development of international trade is beneficial to all participating countries, and it is also good for improving the living conditions of that part of the world's people who are in economic distress. Soviet representative Kuznetsov said correctly: "Relying solely on the development of trade cannot solve all the socio-economic problems that workers are concerned about. However, restoring and expanding international trade and economic ties will be of considerable benefit in reducing unemployment and improving the plight of millions of people."

### 真情实录——莫斯科国际经济会议旁听记

    真情实录
    ——莫斯科国际经济会议旁听记
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    莫斯科国际经济会议上各国代表的发言，留给我们一个强烈的印象：社会主义和人民民主国家的人民生活是多么欣欣向荣，而其他国家的人民生活是多么困苦悲惨。
    这次会议曾探求了与发展国际贸易有关的改善人民生活条件的可能性。
    在苏联和人民民主国家代表的发言中，我们知道了工业、农业、运输业和贸易突飞猛进的情况，听到了人民生活快乐的节奏。失业现象二十年前在苏联已经绝迹，今天在中国也基本解决了。会议前正逢战后苏联第五次减低物价，会议时期又传来了中国减低物价的消息。
    其他国家代表在发言中，提供了完全相反的现象。这些现象是和资本主义制度结生死缘的，并且，由于美国帝国主义集团的加紧扩张军备而严重化，正常的国际贸易的受障碍，这情况更加恶化了。
    第一个普遍现象是失业。世界工联总书记赛扬在会上说：日本劳动者全失业或部分失业的有一千八百万人；西欧国家，即西德、意大利、英国、法国、荷兰、比利时、奥地利和丹麦的全失业工人已从去年的六百二十万人增加到今年二月的七百六十万人，部分失业工人更多。据意大利代表杰·罗维耶达（上院议员，金属工人工会总书记）和布·曼佐齐（经济学家，经济杂志社社长）和鲁·阿马杜齐（总工会经济部主任）都说到意大利失业问题的严重，百分之十五有劳动力的人没有工做，意大利有全失业工人二百万，部分失业工人二百万，还有几百万农业劳动者失业。据法国代表勒布朗说，从一九五一年十月到一九五二年三月，法国全失业工人增加了百分之五十以上。民用工业工人失业现象在美国也是严重的，据美国代表戴溪（劳联印刷工会会员）说：“一九五○年十一月到一九五一年十一月，汽车工业中有十万零三千工人失业，纺织工业中有十一万五千工人被解雇，劳工部预告今年建筑工业中将有四十万工人被解雇。”
    第二个普遍现象是劳动报酬下降、生活费上涨。赛扬举例说：一个人一年平均收入在印尼只有三十美元，在菲律宾——四十四美元，在巴基斯坦——五十一美元，在东非的怯尼亚——六英镑，在南非的北罗得西亚——五英镑。赛扬引证了各国官方宣布的从一九五零年七月到一九五一年十二月生活费指数提高的数字：奥地利——百分之四十七，澳大利亚——百分之四十三，法国——百分之二十八，日本——百分之二十四，阿根廷——百分之二十二，英国——百分之十三，巴西——百分之十一，美国百分之十，巴基斯坦——百分之九等等。日本代表高良富说：在日本，工资只有战前水平的百分之八十一到八十五，而粮食价格却比战前增加百分之四三七，纺织品价格——百分之四四四，工业品价格——百分之一五○。荷兰代表布·布兰德森（荷兰职工联合会总书记）说：“在荷兰，扩张军备牺牲着劳动者的利益，使和平经济完全解体。为了军事用途，现在每个荷兰人，从小孩子到高龄老人每星期平均要纳四个荷盾。”
    第三个普遍现象是老百姓吃不饱。在日本，据日本代表高良富说：“吃的平均标准规定一人一天二千五百卡路里（热量），实际上一九四七年只有一千五百三十五卡路里，一九五一年七月——一千○八十九卡路里，一九五二年一月——八百○六卡路里。”印度代表普列姆·沙加·古普塔（全印职工联合会大会书记）说，在印度，“吃不饱是所有工人的共同现象，食物量一天只一千二百到一千八百卡路里，而需要是三千七百卡路里。”印尼代表伦土拉姆比说：在印尼，“人民的主要粮食——大米是不够的，人们两天吃一次大米，有时三天吃一次。”法国代表勒布朗说：“在法国，劳动阶级的吃不饱，是迫切问题。至于黑人非洲和法属北非洲居民，饥饿问题是十分尖锐的。”
    第四个普遍现象是缺房子住。赛扬说：“住的问题也是全世界大部分劳动居民的严重问题。在法国差缺五百万所寓舍，西德差缺六百万所，四百万意大利人住在破房子里。”英国代表斯坦雷发言中提到英国因为扩军而缺乏钢铁，又因为受外来压力而不能从东方输入足够的木材，所以房荒严重。荷兰代表布兰德森说，目前荷兰有三十多万户家庭没有房住。印度代表古普塔说：“在孟买，有三十多万人没有房子住，不得不睡在街头。小小一个房间有时住十个到二十个工人，有时一个房间住几家人。”巴基斯坦代表周杜礼（议员、地主）说：“因为巴基斯坦大城市的居住荒，甚至现在还有几百万人没有房子而住在街上或小破房里。”巴拉圭代表阿科斯达说：“人民遭受尖锐的居住荒，往往一个房间住二十个人。”
    在这次会议上所反映的如上情况，只是和国际贸易有关的很小的一部分，然而已经可以看出它的严重程度了。造成这种悲惨情况的一个罪根，是美英统治集团的扩张军备、缩减民用生产的政策。据赛扬的发言，占资本主义各国生产的百分之九十三的美国和西欧国家的车床，现在都用在军火工业上。而美国统治集团阻碍东西方国家之间贸易的政策，更加重了这种悲惨情况。赛扬说，日本对中国贸易的受限制，是它的失业者达到一千八百万之多的一个原因。
    在这次会议上各国代表一致认为发展国际贸易对于一切参加的国家都有利益，而对于改善处在经济苦境的那一部分世界人民的生活条件也有好处。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫说得对：“只靠发展贸易，不能够解决劳动者所关心的一切社会经济问题。但是恢复和扩大国际贸易和经济联系，对于减少失业，对于改善千百万人的遭遇，都会有不少益处。”
