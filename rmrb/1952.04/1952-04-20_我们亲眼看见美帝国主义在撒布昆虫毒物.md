    We Personally Witnessed American Imperialism Spreading Insect Poisons
    Insects Dropped by Enemy Aircraft Landed on Me

    The weather in our area was very cold, with snow more than a foot deep on the mountains, and the snow on the ground hadn't completely melted. Before March 12th, we hadn't seen any insects. On March 12th, the weather was clear, and after getting up at dawn, the entire company ran, going more than four li (approximately 2 kilometers) away from the company headquarters. On the way back (around 6:30 AM), we saw a "Black Skin" airplane (an American AD-type naval aircraft) circling twice over our company's position. It then dove down from the north of Afu Flying Ridge (about 1,000 meters northwest of our company's position), without strafing or bombing, and hurriedly flew east. I thought the plane's actions were suspicious. After lunch, I was mending shoes at the entrance of the company headquarters when suddenly an insect, similar to an ant with wings (later I learned it was a psocid), landed on my shoe. I looked up and saw that Company Commander Wang Xianglin also had four of the same insects on him. The barber standing nearby pointed to my back and said, "Little Liu, you have insects on your back too." At that time, a northwest wind was blowing. The wind was light, and many small insects floated downwind. Only when they were about one meter above the ground could their shape be seen, falling like snowflakes. The ant-like insects had wings at the waist. Before long, an area of snow about ten meters long and ten meters wide near the company headquarters was covered with the psocids scattered from the air. The area within a radius of twenty meters around the barracks of the first platoon of this company was also densely covered with the same insects.
    I Saw Enemy Aircraft Dropping Cotton Balls

    Around 10:00 AM on March 16th, I went to a meeting at a higher-level organization. Just as I reached a small hill southwest of Guihua Cave, I suddenly spotted an American F-80 jet fighter flying in from the east, very low. It made a half-circle and flew back east, diving over the back mountain of Jing Shui Dong, dropping many white objects that fell slowly. I ran to report this situation to the higher-level organization and quickly informed the Guihua Cave garrison extermination team by telephone to conduct an inspection. I went along with them and found that where the white objects had fallen, there were indeed twenty-one cotton balls, each weighing about 500 grams. There were also many scattered pieces of cotton nearby, some hanging on branches, some lying on the cliffs. I also saw rat droppings in the cotton. We kept some of the cotton as a specimen, submitted it to the higher-level organization for testing, and burned the rest.
    I Personally Saw Enemy Aircraft Dropping Germ Bombs

    American military aircraft successively dropped three germ bombs in Shuizha Li, Wenchuan County, Jiangyuan Province, Korea. I personally saw the enemy aircraft drop the third germ bomb. On February 28th, as dawn was breaking, I came out of the battalion headquarters to check the sentry posts and heard an enemy night-flying aircraft flying over the air space above the first platoon’s position from southeast to northwest. I also heard the sound of the bomb falling, a "hissing" noise, and saw the light of the explosion, but the explosion sound was very small. I felt that the sound of this bomb exploding was somewhat different from that of ordinary bombs, so I immediately led two squads to search the area where the bomb had fallen. By this time, it was already daylight. On the hillside behind the first platoon's position, we found two large pieces of bomb casing that had split open. Inside one piece of the casing were two leaflets, with a dozen flies crawling on them. Near the casing were many Korean leaflets in red, white, green, and pink. Within a 50-meter radius of the bomb crater, there were large numbers of dense flies and small springtails. This germ bomb was 90 centimeters long, with a tail fin of 50 centimeters, making a total length of about 140 centimeters and a diameter of 34 centimeters. The casing was divided into four sections, with a silver-white igniter on each section, with the English letters "US" printed on the igniter.
    Small Spiders Were Crawling Out of the Germ Bomb Casing

    We lived near Mianchuan Li, Jinhua County, Jiangyuan Province. At about 8:00 PM on March 5th, an American aircraft flew from southwest to northeast, and dropped a bomb as it passed over our area. It did not explode at the time. The next day at about 10:00 AM, I was talking to some comrades in the cooking squad when we heard a "hissing" sound about 15 meters between the company headquarters and the kitchen. A puff of bluish-black smoke rose up. After the smoke cleared, I walked over and saw a bomb that looked like a grenade. One end of the bomb was blown open like a flower. The other end was still intact, and many spiders the size of fingernails were crawling out of the casing. Clearly, this was a germ bomb. The handle of the germ bomb was shaped like a flashlight, about 3 centimeters in diameter and 9 centimeters long; the bomb head was about the size of two fists, the skin was very thin, and the cracked bomb head was still connected to the handle.
    The crime of American imperialism dropping germ bombs this time was not only witnessed by me alone, but by more than a dozen comrades in our cooking squad. And they all personally participated in the work of catching and exterminating spiders. Most of the personnel in my company personally saw the casing of the germ bomb and the spiders near the casing, and can all serve as witnesses.
    The Black Clumps Dropped by Enemy Aircraft Were Actually Insects

    At 2:00 PM on March 9th, on a hillside near Neidong, Chuannei Township, Wenchuan County, my platoon and several dozen comrades from the third platoon were building houses when we saw two "Black Skin" planes (AD-type American naval aircraft) flying in from the northwest, diving down from the east. The plane in the rear dropped two black clumps about the size of washbasins. The terrain of our area is as follows: to the east is a large mountain with dense forests, and to the west is a smaller mountain. We clearly saw one black clump land on the middle of the east-facing slope of the west mountain, and one land on the east mountain. Medic Kang Keming immediately led more than a dozen comrades from my squad, wearing armbands and carrying insect-catching bats, straight to the east-facing slope of the west mountain to investigate the situation where the black clump had landed. When we reached the east-facing slope of the west mountain, we could not find the black clump, but we saw a ditch on the mountainside. In the ditch and on both sides of the ditch, within an area about 200 meters long and 50 meters wide, there were large numbers of dense flies and mosquitoes. We continued to search the entire east-facing slope of the west mountain and the surrounding area, but still did not see the black clump. There were no insects anywhere else, only mosquitoes and flies where the black clump had landed on the mountainside. These insects were obviously scattered after the black clump landed.

    我们亲眼看见美帝国主义在撒布昆虫毒物
    敌机撒布的昆虫落在我身上
    志愿军某部二营四连卫生员　刘常明
    我们驻地的天气很冷，山上还有尺多深的积雪，地面上的雪也没化完。在三月十二日以前，我们没有看见过昆虫。三月十二日，天气晴朗，拂晓起床后，全连跑步，跑出连部四里多路。往回走时（这时约六时半光景），看见一架“黑皮子”飞机（即美军AD式海军飞机），在我连驻地上空盘旋两匝，又从阿虎飞岭北面（我连驻地西北方向一千多公尺的地方）向下俯冲，没有扫射，也没有轰炸，匆匆向正东飞去。我当时觉得这架飞机的行迹可疑。吃过中午饭，我正在连部门口补鞋子，忽然落在我鞋子上一个类似蚂蚁的带翅膀的小虫（后来才知道叫襀翅虫）。我抬头看见连长王相林身上也落了四个同样的小虫。旁边站着的理发员指着我的背说：“小刘，你背上也有虫子。”这时正刮着西北风。风很小，许多小虫顺风飘下。离地面一人多高的时候，才看见小虫的形状，像雪花样纷纷飘下。状似蚂蚁的小虫腰部有翅。不大一会，在连部附近有十公尺长、十公尺宽的一片雪面上，落满了空中撒下的襀翅虫。本连一排驻室周围方圆二十公尺内，也落下密集的同样的小虫。我看见敌机撒棉花团
            志愿军某部　鄢德智
    三月十六日上午十点钟左右，我到上级机关去开会，刚走到桂花洞西南一个小山岭上，突然发现敌F八○型喷气式战斗机一架，由东面飞来，飞得很低，转了半个圈，又回头向东飞去，在经水洞后山俯冲，撒下许多白色物体，下落很慢。我跑步把这一情况报告上级，又很快用电话告诉桂花洞驻军捕灭组进行检查。这时我也跟着去了，发现白色物体的落处，果然有二十一个约十两重的棉花团子，附近有许多零散的棉花，有的挂在树枝上，有的落在石崖上。我还看到棉花里有老鼠屎。我们把这些棉花留一部分做标本，送交上级机关化验，其余都烧掉了。我亲眼看见敌机投细菌弹
    志愿军某部步兵营参谋　王培坤
    美国军用飞机在朝鲜江原道文川郡水砟里先后投下细菌弹三颗。敌机投第三颗细菌弹时，我亲眼看见了。二月二十八日，天曚曚亮，我从营部出来查哨，听见敌夜航机一架，在我一排驻地上空由东南向西北飞过。我还听见炸弹下落时嗤嗤的声音，看到爆炸的光亮，但爆炸声很小。我觉得这个炸弹爆炸的声音和一般炸弹有些两样，便立即带领两个班奔向落弹处进行搜索。这时天已大亮。在一排驻地背后的山坡上，发现有一炸两开的两片大型的弹壳，一片弹壳里有两张传单，十几个苍蝇爬在上面。弹壳附近有很多红、白、绿、粉红色朝鲜文字的传单。弹坑周围五十公尺内，有大批密集的苍蝇和小跳虫。这颗细菌弹身长有九十公分，弹尾为五十公分，全长约一百四十公分，直径为三十四公分。弹壳分四个格，有银白色喷火一个，喷火上印有英文字母“US”。小蜘蛛正从细菌弹壳向外爬
      志愿军某部连文化教员　祁登绅
    我们住在江原道金化郡绵川里附近。三月五日晚八时左右，有美国飞机一架，由西南方向飞往东北，经过我们驻区时投下一弹，当时未炸。第二天上午十时光景，我和炊事班同志正谈话，听见连部与伙房中间约十五米处发出嗤嗤的响声，还冒起一股青黑色的烟。烟散后，我走过去一看，见有像手榴弹似的一颗炸弹，弹的一头炸得像裂开的花瓣。另一头仍很完整，许多手指甲盖大小的蜘蛛正从弹壳里往外爬。很明显，这是一颗细菌弹。这颗细菌弹的弹柄状如手电筒，直径约三公分，长约九公分；弹头约两个拳头大，皮很薄，弹头裂开仍和弹柄连在一起。
    美帝国主义这次空投细菌弹的罪行，不仅我一个人亲眼看到，我们炊事班十几个同志都看到了。并且都亲身参加了捕灭蜘蛛的工作。我连大部人员都亲眼看到了这个细菌弹的弹壳和弹壳附近的蜘蛛，都能作证人。敌机投下的黑团原来是虫子
    志愿军某部二营五连战士　张安常
    三月九日下午二时，在文川郡川内面内洞附近的一个山坡上，我排和三排的几十个同志正在修造房子，看见西北方向飞来两架“黑皮子”飞机（AD式美海军飞机），从正东俯冲下来。后面一架飞机丢下两个脸盆大小的黑团。我们驻地的地形是：东面一座大山，山上有茂盛的森林，西面有一个较小的山。我们很清楚地看见一个黑团落在西山东坡的半坡上，一个落在东山。卫生员康克明立刻领着我班十几个人，扎上袖口，拿着捕虫的拍子，直奔西山东坡黑团落处去侦察情况。走到西山东坡，已找不到黑团，只见山半坡有一道沟。沟中和沟的两侧，约二百公尺长、五十公尺宽地区内，有大批密集的苍蝇和蚊子。我们又继续在整个西山东坡和附近地区搜寻，仍未看见黑团。其他地方都没有虫子，只有山半坡黑团落处有蚊子、苍蝇。这些虫子显然是黑团落地后散布开的。
