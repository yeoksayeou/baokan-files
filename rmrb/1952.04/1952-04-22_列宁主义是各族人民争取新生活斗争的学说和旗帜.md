    Leninism is the doctrine and banner for people of all nationalities to strive for a new life
    Soviet Union  Hā'ěrlānmòfū (哈尔拉莫夫)
    Lenin, the founder of the Bolshevik Party, the creator of the world's first socialist country, and the leader and teacher of the working people of all countries, has passed the eighty-second anniversary of his birth.
    For the laboring people and ordinary people, for all fighters against capitalist enslavement and striving for a new life, there are no names more beloved and precious than those of Lenin and his great successor Stalin.
    Humanity should thank Lenin and Stalin for creating Leninism. Leninism is the theory of proletarian revolution in all countries, the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and the highest achievement of Russian and world culture. The great world-historical significance of Leninism lies in the fact that it opened up the path for mankind to break away from imperialism and move towards the future. Leninism solves all the fundamental problems of the liberation struggle of the working people, points out the only correct path to social and national liberation, and points out the path to the development of social productive forces and cultural prosperity. For more than fifty years, the ideas of Leninism have illuminated the road for all nationalities in their struggle to eliminate war, hunger and unemployment, and the road for peace, democracy and socialism.
    The influence of Lenin and Stalin's doctrines on the historical destiny of all nationalities is gradually increasing. The invincible power of this doctrine lies in the fact that it correctly expresses the fundamental interests of the working masses of all countries. After the broad masses of the people rose up to actively engage in the cause of creating history, Leninism became a powerful creative force in the struggle for a new life without exploitation.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the world's first socialist country were victories for Leninism.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Lenin's greatness lies, first of all, in the fact that he founded the Soviet Republic, and in fact showed the oppressed masses of the world that the hope of salvation has not been lost; that the rule of landlords and capitalists will not last long; that the world of labor rule can be created by the efforts of the workers themselves; and that the world of labor rule is to be created on earth, not in the sky. In this way, he aroused the desire of workers and peasants all over the world to fight for liberation." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume VI, page 48)
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great Stalin, the Soviet people, following Lenin's instructions, have transformed their country into a powerful socialist industrial country.
    The invincible power of the new, socialist social system, its indisputable superiority over capitalism, is manifested first of all in the fact that the Soviet people gloriously defended their historic victory, protecting it from the encroachment of international imperialism; it is also manifested in the successful implementation of the great program of communist construction. The Soviet Union is now carrying out a great plan to transform nature, a plan to build huge hydroelectric power stations and irrigation systems. The first creation of communist construction—the Volga-Don Canal—will soon be open to navigation.
    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people's smooth advance toward communism, clearly point out to all nationalities that only Lenin's path is the path to freedom and happiness, and only socialism can save the people from capitalist oppression and enslavement. Following Lenin's path to socialism, the People's Democratic countries of Europe, under the banner of Leninism, and under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, are achieving great successes in the construction of a new life.
    What tremendous changes have taken place in these countries in a short period of time! Relying on the fraternal selfless assistance and support of the Soviet Union, the working people of the People's Democratic countries have resolutely eradicated the past economic backwardness and are implementing plans for socialist industrialization. In Poland, industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels by one and a half times, and heavy machine manufacturing, automatic tractors, chemicals, shipbuilding and other important industrial sectors have been established. Hungary has changed from a country dominated by agriculture to an industrial country. Its industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels by one and a half times. In the past year alone, the number of workers and employees in Hungary has increased by 109,000. In Romania, industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels by one time. A ten-year electrification plan is being successfully implemented. In Bulgaria, production has exceeded pre-war levels by three times. Huge reservoirs and irrigation systems are under construction. Every year some new factories are opened. The Bulgarian people are completing their five-year plan in industry ahead of schedule. Albania, which had no industry at all in the past, is leaping forward unprecedentedly. The Czechoslovak people have also achieved great successes in economic development. By 1953, the industrial production of Czechoslovakia, which was originally developed industrially, will exceed the level of 1948 by one time.
    Lenin's socialist road not only gives the people of Central and Southeastern Europe freedom and independence, but also gives them the possibility of rapidly developing productive forces, thus guaranteeing rising living standards and culture.
    Now, in the People's Democratic countries, no one is threatened by poverty and unemployment. The growth of the happiness of the working people is guaranteed not only by the step-by-step expansion of national income, but also by a completely different principle of national income distribution from capitalism—the vast majority of the national income is used for the welfare of the workers.
    The People's Republic of China has achieved great successes in building a new life, in the country's industrialization, and in the struggle to break away from economic dependence on capitalist countries.
    Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese people, pointed out that the sound of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. The broad masses of the Chinese people, awakened and engaged in the struggle for liberation by the glorious Chinese Communist Party, overthrew the oppression of foreign imperialists and feudal lords, won freedom and independence, and are successfully transforming the country for their own benefit. The great victory of the Chinese revolution is a new victory for Leninism. The brilliant light of Leninism illuminates the liberation struggle of all nationalities in the world.
    In the powerful camp of socialism and democracy, headed by the Soviet Union, one-third of humanity is already living and working in a new way—the Leninist way.
    The working people of China and the People's Democratic countries of Europe rely on the experience of the Soviet Union and its various forms of assistance in their struggle for a new life. The relationship between the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp is a new, fraternal relationship that does not exist and cannot exist under capitalism. This relationship is based on Lenin's principles of internationalism.
    At the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet state, Lenin instructed: "In terms of relations with all nationalities, our further political and economic goals ... are only one: that is, to establish a fraternal alliance with the workers and laboring people of all countries without exception" (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 29, page 478). The Soviet policy has always unswervingly implemented these instructions of Lenin.
    The great achievements of the socialist camp in building a new life, in developing the economy and culture, and in improving the happiness of the people are the most brilliant evidence of the power of Leninism, as confirmed by life.
    The strength of the democratic and socialist camp is infinite, surpassing the strength of the imperialist camp. An increasing number of millions of people who yearn for freedom and hate imperialist oppression are uniting under the banner of Leninism. The growth of the workers' movement in capitalist countries and the upsurge of the national liberation movement against imperialism in colonies and dependent countries are constantly expanding the ranks of fighters for a new life.
    In commemorating the eighty-second anniversary of the birth of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the working people, the free people of all nationalities within the socialist camp vigilantly watch the conspiracies of the capitalist encirclement. The misanthropic imperialism has brought war, enslavement, and the death of millions to all nationalities. Lenin's words that American imperialism is the most reactionary and shameless, the most insane and bloody, have been completely confirmed.
    Now the millionaires and billionaires of the United States, in pursuit of excessive profits, are preparing for a new world war. They are trying to find a way out of the internal and external contradictions of capitalism, which have become acute, in war.
    The Soviet Union's tireless struggle for peace and cooperation with all nationalities has won the support of more and more people. Lenin said: "The vast majority of residents on the earth support our peace policy." (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 30, page 365)
    The hatred of all nationalities for American imperialism is growing. All those who cherish the future of humanity, who cherish the peace and freedom of all nationalities, are increasingly actively embarking on the path of struggle against imperialism and for peace.
    Through personal experience, people of all nationalities are convinced of the profound correctness of Lenin's words: "There is no path to liberate mankind from war, hunger, and the death of millions, except for socialism." (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 24, page 18)
    Lenin's great doctrine lives and triumphs in the cause of the Soviet people and the people of all nationalities in the entire socialist camp, and lives and triumphs in the liberation struggle of the workers of the world.
    Under the banner of Lenin, and under the leadership of the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin, the people of all nationalities are resolutely moving towards victory in the great struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. (Translated by Jūn Qiáng 君强)

    列宁主义是各族人民争取新生活斗争的学说和旗帜
    苏联  哈尔拉莫夫
    布尔什维克党的奠基者、世界上第一个社会主义国家的缔造者、各国劳动人民的领袖和导师列宁，诞生已整整八十二周年了。
    对于劳动人民和普通的人民来说，对于反对资本主义奴役，争取新生活的全体战士来说，再也没有比列宁及其事业的伟大继承者斯大林的名字更亲爱、更珍贵的了。
    人类应该感谢列宁和斯大林创立了列宁主义。列宁主义是各国无产阶级革命的理论，是帝国主义时代和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，是俄国和世界文化的最高成就。列宁主义的巨大的世界历史性意义，在于它给人类打开了摆脱帝国主义和走向未来的道路。列宁主义解决了劳动人民解放斗争的一切根本问题，指出了社会和民族解放的唯一正确途径，指出了社会生产力发展与文化繁荣的途径。列宁主义的思想为各民族照耀着为消灭战争、饥饿和失业的斗争道路，照耀着争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争道路，已经五十余年了。
    列宁、斯大林的学说，对于各族人民的历史命运的影响，逐渐增加着。这个学说的攻无不克的力量，在于它正确地表达出了各国劳动群众的根本利益。在广大人民群众起来积极地从事创造历史的事业以后，列宁主义就成为争取没有剥削的新生活斗争的强有力的创造力量。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，世界上第一个社会主义国家的建立，就是列宁主义的胜利。
    斯大林同志指示说：“列宁底伟大，首先就是他创立了苏维埃共和国，而在事实上向全世界被压迫群众表明了：得救的希望并没有丧失；地主和资本家底统治是不会长久的；劳动统治的世界是可以由劳动者自身努力来创立的；劳动统治的世界是要在地上创立，而不是在天空里创立的。这样，他就激起了全世界工农争取解放的热望。”（斯大林全集俄文版第六卷第四十八页）
    苏联人民在共产党和伟大的斯大林领导之下，遵循着列宁的遗训，已把自己的国家变成为一个强大的社会主义的工业国家。
    新的、社会主义社会制度的不可征服的力量，它对资本主义的不可争辩的优越性，首先表现在苏联人民光荣地保卫了自己的历史性胜利，使它不受国际帝国主义的侵犯；同时也表现在目前成功地执行着伟大的共产主义建设纲领。苏联现在正进行着伟大的改造自然计划、建设巨大的水电站和灌溉系统的计划。共产主义建设的第一个创造物——伏尔加河—顿河运河，很快就要开航了。
    社会主义在苏联的胜利，苏联人民向共产主义的顺利前进，明显地向各族人民指出：只有列宁的道路是走向自由和幸福的道路，只有社会主义才能挽救人民不受资本主义的压迫和奴役。遵循着列宁的道路走向社会主义的欧洲各人民民主国家，在列宁主义的旗帜下，在共产党和工人党的领导下，在新生活的建设中正获得巨大的成就。
    在短短的时期中，这些国家中发生了如何巨大的变化啊！各人民民主国家的劳动人民，依靠着苏联兄弟般无私的帮助和支持，坚决地铲除了过去的经济落后状态，实现着社会主义工业化的计划。在波兰，工业生产已超过战前水平的一倍半，建立了重机器制造业、自动拖拉机、化学、造船和其他重要工业部门。匈牙利已从以农业为主的国家变成了工业国。它的工业生产已超过战前水平的一倍半。仅在去年一年，匈牙利的工人和职员的数量就增加了十万零九千人。在罗马尼亚，工业生产已超过战前水平的一倍。电气化的十年计划正成功地实现着。在保加利亚，生产已超过战前水平的三倍。巨大的水库和灌溉系统正在建设中。每年都有一些新的工厂开工。保加利亚人民提前完成着工业方面的五年计划。过去完全没有工业的阿尔巴尼亚，空前地向前跃进着。捷克斯洛伐克人民在经济发展方面也达到了巨大成就。到一九五三年时，工业本来发达的捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产，将超过一九四八年水平的一倍。
    列宁的社会主义道路，不仅给中欧和东南欧各国人民以自由和独立，并且还赋予它们迅速发展生产力的可能性，因而保证了生活水平和文化的上升。
    现在，在各人民民主国家中，任何人都不会受到贫穷和失业的威胁。劳动人民幸福的增长，不仅由国民收入的有步骤的扩大来保证，而且还由与资本主义完全不同的另外一种国民收入的分配原则得到保证——国民收入的绝大部分都用在劳动者的福利方面。
    中华人民共和国在建设新生活，在国家工业化和争取在经济上脱离各资本主义国家而独立的斗争中，都达到了巨大的成就。
    中国人民久经考验的领袖毛泽东指出，十月革命的炮响，把马克思列宁主义带到了中国。广大的中国人民，被光荣的中国共产党唤起并从事争取解放的斗争，推翻了外国帝国主义者和封建主的压迫，赢得了自由和独立，并成功地为自己的利益改造着国家。中国革命的伟大胜利，是列宁主义思想的新胜利。列宁主义思想的灿烂光辉，照耀着全世界各族人民的解放斗争。
    在以苏联为首的社会主义和民主的强大阵营中，已经有占全人类三分之一的人口按照新的方式——列宁的方式而生活着，劳动着。
    中国和欧洲各人民民主国家的劳动人民，在争取新生活的斗争中依靠着苏联的经验和她各方面的援助。苏联和社会主义阵营中其他各国之间的关系，是在资本主义条件下所没有，而且也不可能有的一种新的、兄弟般的友好关系。这种关系是基于列宁的国际主义原则的。
    在苏维埃国家成立之初，列宁就曾指示过：“在对各族人民的关系方面，我们进一步的政治和经济目的……只有一个：即无例外地与各国工人和劳动人民建立兄弟联盟”（列宁全集俄文版第二十九卷第四七八页）。苏联的政策始终不渝地实现着列宁的这些指示。
    社会主义阵营各国在建设新生活中、在发展经济和文化、在提高人民幸福中的伟大成就，是为生活所证实的列宁主义思想力量的最光辉的明证。
    民主和社会主义阵营的力量是无穷的，它超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。日益增多的、渴望自由和憎恨帝国主义压迫的数以百万计的人们，都团结在列宁主义的旗帜之下。资本主义各国工人运动的增长，殖民地和附属国反对帝国主义的民族解放运动的高涨，使争取新生活的战士行列不断扩大。
    在纪念劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师列宁诞生八十二周年的时候，社会主义阵营内各族自由人民警惕地注视着资本主义包围的阴谋。仇视人类的帝国主义给各族人民带来了战争、奴役和成百万人的死亡。列宁所说美帝国主义是最反动和无耻的、最疯狂和血腥的这句话，已被完全证实了。
    现在美国的百万和亿万富翁们，追逐着超额的利润，准备新的世界战争。他们企图在战争中寻求摆脱资本主义已经尖锐化了的内外矛盾的出路。
    苏联为争取和平以及与各族人民合作而进行的不倦斗争，得到了愈来愈多的人们的拥护。列宁说过：“地球上最大多数居民都赞成我们的和平政策”。（列宁全集俄文版第三十卷第三六五页）
    各族人民对美帝国主义的仇恨正在增长。一切珍贵人类前途、珍贵各族人民和平和自由的人们，都愈来愈积极地走上了反对帝国主义、争取和平的斗争道路。
    各族人民由于亲身的体验，确信列宁这句话的深刻正确性：“除了社会主义之外，使人类摆脱战争、饥饿和数以百万计的人们的死亡的解放之路，是没有的。”（列宁全集俄文版第二十四卷第十八页）
    列宁的伟大学说，在苏联人民和整个社会主义阵营的各族人民的事业中活着，战胜着，在全世界劳动者的解放斗争中活着，战胜着。
    各族人民在列宁的旗帜下，在伟大的和平旗手斯大林同志的领导下，在伟大的争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中，正坚决地走向胜利。（君强译）
