    The Changed Face of the South Site of Yangquan No. 3 Mine
    To the Editor: The "Three-Anti" movement has changed the face of the South Site of Yangquan No. 3 Mine. In the past, the South Site was a "den of tigers," where all the power of leadership was in the hands of corrupt elements. They bullied those above and suppressed those below, oppressing the workers and even delaying the payment of wages for more than half a year. Because of the lack of ladders, loading workers suffered several work-related injuries. However, the leadership turned a blind eye and refused to adopt the workers' rationalization proposals. The workers' production enthusiasm was low, and they thought the South Site was a "three-no-care zone." In the "Three-Anti" struggle, those corrupt and degenerate elements collapsed. The workers immediately elected Zhang Zhongshan, an activist who had always been responsible and loved the workers, to take up the leadership position in the trade union. The newly elected cadres solved many difficulties for the workers. Zhang Zhongshan took the initiative to request the People's Government to vacate the temples in the neighboring villages for the workers to live in because the loading workers' dormitories were crowded and could not accommodate them. He led the repair and manufacture of ladders and suggested that the administrative side reissue the wages that had been in arrears before the "Three-Anti." The workers loved and respected him and said with emotion: "Old Zhang handles everything properly, he is really a good example for our workers." The workers' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved. They increased the loading efficiency by 20% and completed the loading task for March ten days ahead of schedule.

    阳泉三矿南场的面貌改变了
    编辑同志：“三反”运动把阳泉三矿南场的面貌改变了。过去，南场是一个“老虎窝”，一切领导大权都操在贪污分子手里。他们欺上凌下，压制工人，甚至积压工人工资半年多不发。装车工人因缺乏梯板，曾出过几次工伤。但领导方面熟视无睹，不采纳工人的合理化建议。工人们生产情绪低落，认为南场是个“三不管”。“三反”斗争中，那些贪污蜕化分子垮下去了。工人们马上选出了一贯负责、热爱工人的积极分子张忠善担任工会领导职务。新选出来的干部为工人解决了很多困难。装车工人宿舍拥挤，住不下，张忠善就主动地请求人民政府，把邻近村庄里的庙宇空出来给工人住。他领导修制了梯板，又建议行政方面补发了“三反”前积压的工资。工人们都爱戴他，感动地说：“老张把什么事情都办妥了，真是我们工人的好榜样。”工人的生产热情大大提高。他们提高了装车效率百分之二十，并提前十天完成三月份的装车任务。
