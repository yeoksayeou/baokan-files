    We Grew Up With Our Farm
    Comrade Editor: I want to write about my life on the farm and tell it to the compatriots of the motherland.
    Our farm was established in 1947. At that time, we lived in tents and drank ditch water, and life was very hard. In the desolate and vast Great Northern Wilderness, violent winds and rain often uprooted our tents, and people were drenched like drowned chickens. But we did not flinch. We sang songs while dragging the tent back and setting it up again. When reclaiming wasteland in the summer, we worked in shifts day and night. In the morning, we walked along the mountain road covered with wildflowers, facing the rising sun, and headed to the site full of energy; in the evening, we dragged our tired bodies back, and we picked up washbasins and porcelain bowls and used them as gongs and drums, and sang loudly with our hoarse voices. In this way, we, like the growth of the farm, became stronger and more powerful day by day.
    In 1950, we used Soviet-style combine harvesters. Watching the blades automatically cut wheat, we felt indescribably happy. Piles of golden wheat filled the field, and we couldn't help but recall the scene of fighting against wind and rain and persisting in labor throughout the year. Our labor had paid off.
    Now our farm has grown up. In the beginning, we only had 12,000 mu of cultivated land, but now it has developed to 100,000 mu, and we own 70 large and small locomotives; originally there were only more than 100 staff members, but now it has increased to 1,200 people. We have also trained more than 300 technical and administrative cadres and sent them to farms all over the country. The days when we lived in tents have long become history. We now live in tall and beautiful buildings standing on the grasslands of the Great Northern Wilderness. When the holidays come, melodious or majestic songs spread throughout our houses, full of vitality.
    This year, at the beginning of the spring plowing, we held a rally to launch a bumper harvest competition. Look! People are all mobilized, our locomotives are galloping on the grasslands of the motherland, and everything has started again.

### 我们和我们的农场成长起来了

    我们和我们的农场成长起来了
    编辑同志：我要把我在农场的生活情况写出来告诉祖国的同胞。
    我们的农场是一九四七年建立的。那时，我们住帐棚、喝沟水，生活很苦。在荒凉辽阔的北大荒上，狂风暴雨常把我们的帐棚连根拔起，人就淋得像落汤鸡。但我们毫不退缩，一面唱着歌，一面就把棚帐拖回重新安好。夏季开荒时，我们分班日夜干活。我们在早晨沿着铺满野花的山路，迎着初升的太阳，带着满身劲头走向现场；在晚上，拖着疲乏的身子回来，还拿起脸盆、磁碗当锣鼓敲，放开嘶哑的嗓子唱起歌来。就这样，我们和农场的生长一样，日渐粗壮有力了。
    一九五○年，我们使用了苏联式康拜因机械，看着刀片自动割麦，心里有说不出的舒畅。一堆堆金黄的麦子堆满了场地，我们禁不住回味起一年来与风雨作斗争，坚持劳动的情景来。我们的劳动有了成果了。
    如今我们的农场已经成长起来。开始时我们只有一万二千亩耕地，现在发展到十万亩了，并且拥有大小型机车七十台；原来只有一百多个工作人员，现在增加到了一千二百人。我们曾经还培养出三百多个技术和行政干部，输送到了各地农场去。我们住帐棚的日子早已成为历史上的事了，我们现在住的是矗立在北大荒草原上的高大美丽的建筑物。当节日来临时，我们的房子里面就传播出悠扬或雄壮的歌声，生气蓬勃。
    今年春耕开始，我们誓师展开丰产竞赛。看！人们都出动了，我们的机车正在祖国的草原上驰骋着，一切又重新开始了。
