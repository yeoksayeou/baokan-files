    We are Determined to Reduce the Defect Rate to Below Two in Ten Thousand
    By Zhang Shaoru, Model Worker of a Factory in Chongqing

    This time, I went to our great ally, the Soviet Union, to attend the May Day International Labor Day celebrations in Moscow. Although I cannot participate in the production competition to welcome May Day, I can learn production experience from our Soviet elder brothers. After I return, I will definitely make good use of the advanced Soviet experience to welcome the upcoming new upsurge of economic construction in our country.

    Last January, when I heard the news of the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge to workers across the country, I was very interested in responding. However, at that time, the opinions of our group members were not consistent. Some backward comrades said, "What's the point of responding to the challenge! Just produce according to the rules." I consulted with activists, explaining the principle of the working class being the masters of the country. We all felt from the bottom of our hearts that the working class is the leading class, and we must take the lead in all work. Can we lag behind in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea? Relying on activists, I got through the thinking of backward people, and our group passed the resolution to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. At that time, in the entire Southwest region, we were the only group that responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group.

    "How can we do it well?" I kept pondering.

    Once, when I went to collect materials, I heard that the value of the materials was very high, so I thought: saving one point of material is equivalent to increasing one point of strength to resist US aggression and aid Korea. I asked the comrades in the group: "How can we waste less material?" An old worker immediately asked me back: "We often produce defective products, so what's the point of talking about wasting less material?" Everyone believed that defective products must be eliminated first. Therefore, eliminating defective products became an important part of our response to the challenge. In order to reduce defective products, we seriously studied the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, implemented a mutual assistance inspection system, inspected the first product, and strengthened technical learning. In this way, we reduced the defect rate from 2% to 0.038%, breaking the conservative view of the entire factory that defective products must be calculated as a percentage. However, we are still not satisfied, we have not completely eliminated defective products! This year, we decided to further reduce the defect rate to below 0.02%.

    While eliminating defective products, we also strived to improve work efficiency. Our working hours used to be very wasteful. I and the group comrades discussed how to avoid or reduce downtime during working hours. Everyone decided: reduce the time for changing tools and use free time to repair the faults of the machines. Implement labor mutual assistance, and whoever goes to urinate helps watch the car, etc. In this way, we can complete ten hours of work in nine hours. Recently, we have been constantly improving work efficiency.

    After we reduced defective products and improved work efficiency, we felt that our technical and cultural level was not high enough. We must also learn from advanced production groups across the country and train all the comrades in our group to become workers who can master technology and have cultural accomplishments.

    Last October, I represented the group to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, and I was also honored to attend the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and saw our most beloved Chairman Mao. At that time, I was very ashamed, because my contribution to the country was too small, but the honor I received was too great. When I returned to Chongqing, I told everyone: we must work hard and respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy." Our group participated in the "tiger hunting team" and captured a big embezzler who had embezzled more than 100 million yuan; but we did not delay production. Our production is better than before. After the "Three-Anti" struggle, our class consciousness has been raised, and the backward elements who were always unwilling to work actively in the past have also changed; the thinking of technicians who do not go deep into the field and do not approach the workers has also changed. When I left Chongqing, the comrades in our group all guaranteed to me: they will resolutely complete this year's plan to increase production and save 100 tons of grain.

### 我们决心把废品率降低到万分之二以下

    我们决心把废品率降低到万分之二以下
    重庆某工厂劳动模范  张少如
    我这次到我们伟大的盟国苏联，参加莫斯科的“五一”国际劳动节观礼。虽然我不能参加迎接“五一”的生产大竞赛，但是我可以向苏联老大哥学习生产经验。等我回来之后，我一定好好运用苏联的先进经验，迎接我国就要到来的经济建设的新高潮。
    去年一月，我听见马恒昌小组向全国工人挑战的消息，我很有意起来应战。但当时我们小组同志的意见不一致。有些落后的同志说：“应战干什么！照规矩生产就行了。”我找积极分子商量，说明工人阶级当家作主的道理。我们都从心里感到：工人阶级是领导阶级，什么工作都得要带头干，抗美援朝还能落在人后面吗？我依靠积极分子，打通了落后的人的思想，使我们小组通过了向马恒昌小组应战的决议。那时候，在全西南地区，只有我们是唯一的向马恒昌小组应战的小组。
    “怎样才能做好呢？”我一直捉摸着。
    有一次，我去领材料，我听说材料的价值很高，就想：少浪费一分材料，就等于多增加一分抗美援朝的力量。我问小组里的同志们：“怎样才能少浪费材料？”有一个老工友马上反问我：“我们常常出废品，还空谈什么少浪费材料？”大家都认为必须首先消灭废品。因此，消灭废品就成了我们应战的重要内容。为要减少废品，我们认真学习了马恒昌小组的经验，实行互助检查制，检查头一个产品，加强技术学习。这样，我们把废品率从百分之二降低到万分之三点八，打破了全厂过去必须以百分率计算废品的保守观点。但是，我们还是不满足，我们还没有完全消灭废品！今年我们决定再把废品率降低到万分之二以下。
    我们在消灭废品的同时，又努力提高工作效率。我们的工时过去是有很大浪费的。我和小组同志们商量怎样在工作时间不停车或少停车。大家决定：减少换工具的时间，利用空闲的时间修理车子的毛病。实行劳动互助，谁去小便，就帮助谁看车等。这样，我们就能以九小时完成十小时的工作。最近我们还在不断地提高工作效率。
    我们减少了废品，提高了工作效率以后，我们又感到自己的技术和文化程度还不够高。我们还要向全国先进的生产小组学习，把我们全组同志都培养成为能掌握技术的有文化修养的工人。
    去年十月，我代表小组到北京参加国庆观礼，又光荣地列席了人民政协全国委员会第三次会议，看见了我们最敬爱的毛主席。当时我很惭愧，因为我对于国家的贡献太小，所接受的荣誉却太大。我回到重庆，见人就说：我们要好好干，响应毛主席
    “增加生产，厉行节约”的号召。我们小组参加了
    “打虎队”，捉住了贪污一亿元以上的大贪污分子；但我们并没有耽误了生产。我们的生产比过去更好了。经过“三反”斗争，我们的阶级觉悟提高了，过去一向不愿积极工作的落后分子也转变了；不深入现场、不接近工人的技术人员的思想也改变了。在我离开重庆的时候，我们小组同志都向我保证：要坚决完成今年增产节约一百吨粮食的计划。
