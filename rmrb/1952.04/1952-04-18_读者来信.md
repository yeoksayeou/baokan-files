    The Anti-Corruption Struggle at Shandong Normal College Is Extremely Incomplete
    Editor: I am informing you of the extremely incomplete state of the anti-corruption struggle at Shandong Normal College.
    The anti-corruption movement at Shandong Normal College has been going on for over two months. Everyone suspects that there are problems with the new school buildings built last year with more than 7 billion yuan, but no problems have been found yet. The new school buildings have been built for less than half a year, but the tiles are falling off in the wind, the floors are sinking all over, and the doors and windows are not tight. What is worth studying is that the students in the original school supervision team were very strict in receiving and inspecting materials, but once they asked for instructions from the school leadership, they relaxed. The head of the General Affairs Section, Lü Weifeng, was corrupt and took bribes, resisted the "Three-Anti" campaign, and was once dismissed and placed under supervision for introspection. At first, he was "supervised" at the president's house (he is the president's cousin). He handled more than 6 billion yuan of public funds alone. He and the purchasing agent Zhang Zhongsan (his cousin, a major corrupt official) often went to purchase goods, eat, drink, and have fun with private merchants, but the leadership did not conduct a thorough investigation and study before affirming that he had no major problems. The engineer Han Shiqing (formerly a private merchant) hired to build the new school buildings was originally suspected of corruption and bribery of 5 million yuan, and there were materials from the agency reporting him. He was once officially announced at a conference to be placed under supervision for introspection, but after a few days, he was released and allowed to return to the mountains. Recently, he was again being pursued as a "tiger" target. The masses are extremely confused about this matter.
    Due to the extremely serious bureaucracy that has always existed in the leadership and the lack of principles in employing people (the president was originally also the director of general affairs, the head of the general affairs section is the president's cousin, the purchasing agent and major corrupt official Zhang Zhongsan is the president's cousin, the storekeeper Lü Zihe is also the president's cousin, and the mess hall manager Chen Xiliang is the president's former student, and he is also the manager of a soy sauce garden...), the state property has suffered extremely serious losses in the past year. At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" campaign, the leading cadres made extremely shallow self-criticisms. The president avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial, self-criticizing localism, bureaucracy, and extravagance. The dean of academic affairs has extremely serious bureaucracy in the leadership of academic administration, but does not conduct a deep self-criticism.
    The leading cadres also called on the masses to boldly express their opinions, but the theory and practice are inconsistent with them. When everyone unanimously requested to participate in practical work and stand at the forefront of the anti-corruption struggle—participating in the inspection team to carry out specific work—the leadership poured cold water on the masses. The dean of academic affairs said that the students' general request to participate in specific work was extreme democratic thought; said that the inspection team was not so easy to join, said that they must have no contact with capitalists; said what so many people would do in the general affairs section. He also openly defended the corrupt elements reported by the masses, saying that the mistakes they committed were issues of ideology and work style and did not fall within the scope of the "Three-Anti" campaign; and declared that the masses' opposition to bureaucracy in the leadership was "evil rising and righteousness declining." Some cadres reported the students' opinions to him, and he said: "What are you afraid of! No matter how much they complain, it's just about bureaucracy!"
    We request the relevant leadership of Shandong Normal College to pay attention to this issue and thoroughly resolve it.　Yang Yi, Chen Ling, etc.

    Over Twenty Thousand Workers in Private Coal Mines in Mentougou
    The Local Party Committee Should Strengthen Leadership
    Editor: There are more than one hundred private coal mines in Mentougou, western Beijing, with about 23,000 workers. Some of these workers are part-time workers and part-time farmers, with high mobility; the old workers who are permanently working in Mentougou account for more than one-third. The local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in Mentougou rarely consider the education of these workers, but completely hand this work over to the trade union. In reality, the trade union does a very poor job, and the Party committee never inspects it.
    Mentougou has a total population of 50,000, of which more than 20,000 are workers in private coal mines, so the work of the workers is very important. There are many Party and League members in Mentougou, and they are all led by the street branch. The education they receive is not enough. We request that the higher-level Party organizations pay attention to this situation and strengthen the education and leadership of the workers.

    All Employees of Taiyuan Flour Mill No. 2
    Completed Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule in March, Increasing Wealth by More Than 600 Million Yuan
    Editor: The employees of Taiyuan Flour Mill No. 2 have combined "tiger" beating with production, and their enthusiasm is very high. They automatically persisted in the "tiger" beating task for one hour before work and one hour after work. On the production front, the workers of the third shift of the flour milling group saved zero repair time and produced more than 1,100 bags of flour. Huo Yulin, a technician from the group, used water-based glue instead of foreign glue, which can save 2,200 kilograms of millet throughout the year. The old worker Qiao Jixiang's experiment of replacing wire drawing knives with all-steel blades has been successful. Each wire drawing knife is worth more than 2 million yuan, and the factory uses 12 per year. Now, it only costs the price of one wire drawing knife to buy an all-steel knife. Because the workers' political consciousness has been raised in the "Three-Anti" campaign, the factory completed the production task for March five days ahead of schedule, exceeding the monthly production plan by 18.6 percent, increasing the production of flour by more than 10,500 bags, and increasing the country's wealth by more than 624 million yuan. Now, all the employees are preparing to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day with greater enthusiasm and a victorious spirit with even better results.

    Workers of the Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Maintenance and Repair Factory
    Strive to Increase Production to Welcome "May Day"
    Editor: The workers of the turnout group of the Beijing Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Maintenance and Repair Factory, under the leadership of railway labor model Peng Xingde, are striving to overfulfill production tasks in the tense "Three-Anti" struggle. In production, working hours have been shortened, but quality has been improved. In the past, it took 15 work shifts to manufacture a set of frog hearts, now it only takes 12 shifts; in the past, it took four shifts to produce a piece of switch rail, now it has been reduced to three shifts. As the Labor Day holiday of the working people, "May Day," is approaching, the turnout group workers have expressed confidence in overfulfilling their tasks. They have put forward conditions such as no industrial injury accidents, no reworked jobs, improving quality, utilizing waste materials (target 20 million yuan), reducing costs, doing a good job in environmental sanitation, and doing a good job in recovering stolen goods, and have issued a friendly challenge to all workshops in the factory and the entire region. They will also increase the production of 20 pieces of switch rails and one set of frog hearts (equivalent to 70 million yuan), and jointly dedicate one day of work as a gift for "May Day."

    读者来信
    各地中小学校的教师
    决心进行广泛宣传，揭露美国强盗发动细菌战罪行
    ——读者来信综述
    各地中小学校教师连续给本报来信，抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。
    平原省中等学校教职员整风大会来信说：“我平原省中等学校教职员一千五百六十八人，希望全中国的教育工作者积极行动起来，制止美国侵略者惨绝人寰的罪行，向美国侵略者讨还血债。我们保证在今后很好地贯彻爱国主义教育，彻底揭露美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。”中国教育工会辽东省岫岩中学基层委员会来信说：“我们岫岩中学全体教职员，决心以百倍的信心和勇气，为扑灭美国细菌战的毒焰而斗争。我们已经行动起来了，已经投入反细菌战的斗争中。”福建省泉州市私立西隅中学教职员王志平等二十人来信说：“我们是新中国的教育工作者，我们要用努力改造思想、提高教学工作、厉行增产节约等实际行动，和撒布细菌的美国侵略者进行坚决的斗争。”河南省罗山县第七区各小学校全体教职员的信中说：“我们坚决拥护周恩来外交部长的声明。我们保证，除搞好我们的业务工作以外，并要加强宣传工作，揭发美国强盗的滔天罪行，为粉碎美国强盗的侵略阴谋而斗争。”苏北建湖县华林小学全体教师来信说：“我们决心发动全体学生，向群众揭露美国强盗的罪恶行为，使华林全村和附近村中的人民，都用实际行动为反细菌战而斗争。”
    山东师范学院反贪污斗争极不彻底
    编辑同志：我把山东师范学院反贪污斗争极不彻底的情况告诉你们。
    山东师范学院的反贪污运动已经进行了两个多月。大家怀疑去年用七十多亿元建筑的新校舍中有问题，但到现在还没有检查出问题来。新校舍建筑还不到半年，却已经是风吹瓦落，满屋地陷，门窗不严了。值得研究的是：原校方监工组同学收料验料都很严，但一请示到校部领导方面，就放宽了。总务科长吕巍峰贪污受贿，对抗“三反”，曾被撤职管制反省。起初他被“管制”在院长家里（他是院长表弟）。他一人经手公款达六十多亿，他和采购员张忠三（他的表侄，大贪污犯）经常一同去采购物品，和私商吃喝玩乐，但领导方面没有经过缜密的调查研究，就肯定他没有大问题。建筑新校舍雇请的工程师韩式庆（原系私商）原有贪污受贿五百万元嫌疑，并有机关检举材料，曾经大会正式宣布管制反省，但没有几天，就被放纵归山，最近却又把他当作“老虎”对象来追打。群众对这件事异常迷惑不解。
    由于领导方面一向存在着极为严重的官僚主义，用人又毫无原则（院长原兼总务长，总务科长是院长的表弟，采购员大贪污犯张忠三是院长的表侄，保管员吕子和也是院长的表侄，伙食管理员陈锡良是院长过去的学生，他同时是一个酱园的经理……），一年来使国家财产遭受了极为严重的损失。“三反”运动开始时，领导干部检讨得极不深刻，院长避重就轻地检讨了本位主义、官僚主义与铺张浪费现象。教务长在教务行政领导上存在着极为严重的官僚主义，但不进行深刻检讨。
    领导干部也号召群众大胆提意见，但理论与实际在他们是不一致的。等大家一致要求参加实际工作，要求站在反贪污斗争的最前哨——参加检查组进行具体工作时，领导方面却在群众头上大泼冷水。教务长说同学普遍要求参加具体工作是极端民主思想；说检查组不是那么容易参加的，说要与资本家没有联系的；说要那么多人到总务科干什么？他并且公开为被群众检举的贪污分子辩护，说他们犯的错误是思想作风问题，不属于“三反”范围；并声言群众反领导上的官僚主义是“邪气上升，正气下降”。有的干部向他反映同学意见，他说：“怕什么！提来提去不过是一条官僚主义！”
    我们要求山东师范学院的有关领导方面，重视这个问题，并彻底加以解决。　杨易　陈玲等
    门头沟私营煤窑两万多工人
    当地党委应当加强领导
    编辑同志：北京西门头沟有一百多座私营煤窑，约有两万三千工人。这些工人，有的半工半农，流动性较大；固定在门头沟工作的老工人占三分之一以上。中共门头沟地方组织很少考虑这些工人的教育问题，而把这个工作完全交给工会去做。实际上，工会做得极差，党委也从不检查。
    门头沟共有五万人口，其中私营煤窑的工人占两万多人，所以工人工作是很重要的。门头沟的党、团员很多，他们都受街道支部领导，他们所受的教育是不够的。我们要求党的上级组织重视这一情况，加强对工人的教育和领导。

    太原面粉二厂全体职工
    三月份提前完成生产任务增产财富六亿多元
    编辑同志：太原面粉二厂职工把打“虎”和生产结合起来，劲头挺大。他们自动坚持了上班前一小时，下班后一小时的打“虎”任务。在生产战线上，制粉组三班工人节省零修时间，多产一千一百多袋面粉。该组技术员霍玉林以水胶代替外货胶，全年可节省二千二百多斤小米。老工人乔基翔以全钢刀片代替拉丝刀的试验，已经成功。每把拉丝刀价值二百多万元，该厂每年要用十二把，现在只要花一把拉丝刀的代价买全钢刀，就够用了。由于工人们在“三反”运动中政治觉悟提高，该厂提前五日完成了三月份的生产任务，全月超额完成生产计划百分之十八点六，增产面粉一万零五百多袋，给国家增加财富六亿二千四百多万元。现在，全体职工正以高度的热情和胜利的心情，准备用更好的成绩来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。　牛俊英　赵汉卿西直门工务机具保养修配厂工人
    努力增产迎接“五一”节
    编辑同志：北京西直门工务机具保养修配厂道岔组工人，在铁路劳动模范彭兴德领导下，在紧张的
    “三反”斗争中，争取超额完成生产任务。在生产上，工时缩短了，质量却提高了。过去制造一付辙岔心要十五个工，现在只要十二个工；过去生产一条尖轨要四个工，现在降到三个工。在劳动人民的节日“五一”节快要到来的今天，道岔组工人都表示有信心超额完成任务。他们提出了不出公伤事故，不出返手活，提高质量，利用废料（目标二千万元），减低成本，作好环境卫生工作，搞好追赃工作等条件，向全厂全地区各车间提出友谊挑战。他们并以多增产二十条尖轨、一付辙岔心（折合七千万元），共同献工一日，作为“五一”劳动节的献礼。
