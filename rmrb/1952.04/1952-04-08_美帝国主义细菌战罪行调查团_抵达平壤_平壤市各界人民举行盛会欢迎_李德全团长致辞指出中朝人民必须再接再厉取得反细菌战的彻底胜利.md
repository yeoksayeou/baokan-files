Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. The "Investigation Group on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism," led by the head of the delegation Li Dequan and deputy head Liao Chengzhi, arrived in Pyongyang on the 5th and was warmly welcomed by representatives from all walks of life in the Korean Party, government, military, and civilians.

The people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand welcome meeting on the evening of the 6th. Among those present were Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet Hong Myong-hui, Minister of Health Li Byong-nam, Minister of Education Baek Nam-un, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jeong-ae, Deputy Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee Li Hak-soo, and other government and Korean Workers' Party leaders, as well as heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and representatives of the working people in the Pyongyang area, totaling more than 800 people. Also participating in the welcome were Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, representatives of foreign embassies in Korea, and representatives of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Korean Minister of Health Li Byong-nam first delivered a welcome speech, saying: On behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I extend a warm welcome and gratitude to all comrades of the investigation group sent by the fraternal Chinese people who are sincerely assisting us in our anti-aggression war. As you all know, the U.S. imperialists have committed unprecedented and brutal crimes in the Korean War. Since January of this year, they have blatantly used bacteriological weapons, which are absolutely intolerable under international conventions and human morality, and have spread large quantities of poisonous insects and substances carrying germs of infectious diseases such as plague and cholera not only in the front and rear of Korea but also in the northeastern region of the People's Republic of China. Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, successively issued statements exposing the heinous crimes of the enemy in carrying out bacteriological warfare in a planned manner. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation group also exposed the truth about the crimes of the American aggressors to the world. Recently, Soviet representative Malik firmly advocated the adoption of a decision prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which reflects the anger of all good people in the world. No atrocity of the American aggressors can weaken the unyielding will of the Korean people to fight, and the shameless and desperate struggles of the robbers will never save them from their fate of defeat. The entire Korean people, firmly united around the Workers' Party and the Republic government, and with the sincere assistance of the epidemic prevention teams sent by the people of various fraternal countries, have built an iron-like epidemic prevention fortress and are striving to crush the heinous bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism. I sincerely congratulate you comrades on achieving complete success in the important work of directly investigating the crimes of bacteriological warfare by U.S. imperialism.

Then, Jeong Seong-yeon, representative of the Korean Fatherland Front, delivered a welcome speech. He said: Your visit has attracted the attention of the people all over the world, because you will expose the heinous crimes of the American aggressors to the world based on the conclusive evidence of direct investigation. The American aggressors are openly using bacteriological weapons in an attempt to reverse their defeat and expand the war of aggression, but this will never intimidate the Korean people. The more brutal the enemy is, the more the Korean people hate them. With the enthusiastic support of the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in the world, the Korean people will surely achieve final victory, and the common enemy of mankind—the U.S. imperialists—must be subjected to a strict and just trial by a new Nuremberg court.

Head of the delegation Li Dequan delivered a reply speech. She said: Our investigation group has been in heroic fighting Korea for more than half a month. Some of our members have participated in the testing of poisonous insects and substances containing bacteria spread by the enemy, and some have gone in groups to the sites where the enemy spread poisonous insects and substances to conduct on-the-spot investigations and interview eyewitnesses and witnesses among the local military and civilians. The results of our inspection and the materials we obtained from our on-the-spot investigation have conclusively confirmed the fact that U.S. imperialism is conducting bacteriological warfare on a large scale in the front and rear of Korea. After we return to China, we will, together with the Northeast branch of our group, write an investigation report to accuse U.S. imperialism of its heinous crimes against humanity before all just people in the world.

Li Dequan said: U.S. imperialism's conduct of bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China is a disastrous political failure. Now, the people all over the world clearly see a fact: if the evil deeds of U.S. imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and our country are not severely punished and stopped by the people all over the world, then the disasters suffered by the Chinese and Korean people today will fall on the heads of the people all over the world tomorrow. Precisely because of this, the fire of anger against U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare has been burning fiercely all over the world. The broad masses of people in the towns and villages of the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe, the bastion of world peace and democracy, have gathered to lodge serious protests against the American aggressors. In Asian countries such as India, Burma, Iran, and Pakistan, and in capitalist countries such as France, Italy, Britain, Finland, and Denmark, and even in Latin American countries under the strict control of U.S. imperialism, people have also voiced righteous condemnation of this evil act of U.S. imperialism. Brave Korean friends, our anti-bacteriological warfare front is unprecedentedly strong, and all peace-loving people in the world are with us. Because they know that the complete victory of the Chinese and Korean people against bacteriological warfare is also the victory of the cause of defending peace for the people of the world.

Li Dequan also said: Since January 28, when the American aggressors began spreading poisonous insects and substances containing bacteria in the front and rear of Korea, the number of times has reached 322 by incomplete statistics as of March 25. The area where the enemy spread poisonous insects and substances is quite wide, and their intentions are very vicious. The poisonous insects and substances spread by the enemy contain highly toxic plague bacilli, typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, dysentery, and other germs and other viruses that are extremely contagious and harmful to the people. These facts should arouse our greatest vigilance. We must fully recognize that opposing U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare is a long-term and arduous struggle, and any slightest thought of paralysis is harmful. We must always pay attention to the enemy's conspiracies and tricks and be ready to defeat them at any time. Thanks to the careful and organized epidemic prevention measures of the Korean people and the Korean-Chinese People's Army, we have effectively controlled and prevented the epidemic the enemy dreamed of. We have won the first round of victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare. We must continue our efforts, be neither arrogant nor rash, and achieve a complete victory against bacteriological warfare on the basis of our existing victory.

Then Zeng Zhaolun, a member of the investigation group, spoke, saying: The American aggressors' military gamble on the Korean battlefield has failed. It is also futile for them to try to save their failed fate by using inhumane bacteriological warfare. The Korean people and the Korean-Chinese troops will surely be able to completely smash their bacteriological warfare and all their vicious conspiracies.

The conference proceeded in an atmosphere of warm friendship, unity, and full of confidence in victory from beginning to end.

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”抵达平壤
    平壤市各界人民举行盛会欢迎
    李德全团长致辞指出中朝人民必须再接再厉取得反细菌战的彻底胜利
    【新华社平壤七日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”在团长李德全、副团长廖承志的率领下，在五日到达平壤，受到朝鲜党政军民各界代表的热烈欢迎。
    平壤市各界在六日晚举行盛大的欢迎会。到会的有朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹、保健相李炳南、教育相白南云、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记朴正爱、平壤市人民委员会副委员长李鹤秀等政府和朝鲜劳动党首长，以及各民主政党、社会团体的负责人、朝鲜人民军官兵及平壤地区劳动人民代表等八百多人。参加欢迎的还有我国驻朝鲜大使馆代办甘野陶、各国驻朝使馆代表和中国人民志愿军某部代表。
    朝鲜保健相李炳南首先致欢迎辞，他说：我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府向诚挚地援助我们进行反侵略战争的兄弟般的中国人民所派遣的调查团全体同志致热烈的欢迎和感谢。远道而来的各位都知道美帝国主义在侵朝战争中制造了史无前例的残暴罪行，并从今年一月起明目张胆地使用国际公约和人类道德所绝对不能容许的细菌武器，不但在朝鲜前后方，甚至在中华人民共和国东北地区大量撒布了带有鼠疫、霍乱等传染病菌的毒虫毒物。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国朴宪永外务相和中华人民共和国周恩来外交部长先后发表声明，揭露了敌人有计划地进行细菌战的滔天罪行。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团也向全世界揭露了美国侵略者的罪行真相。最近苏联代表马立克在联合国裁军委员会上坚决主张通过禁止使用细菌武器的决定，这反映了全世界善良人民的愤怒。美国侵略者的任何暴行也不可能削弱朝鲜人民百折不挠的斗争意志，强盗们无耻的垂死挣扎绝不会挽回其失败的命运。全朝鲜人民巩固地团结在劳动党和共和国政府的周围，在各兄弟国家人民所派遣的防疫队诚挚的援助下，筑成了钢铁般的防疫堡垒，努力粉碎美帝国主义的万恶的细菌战。我衷心地祝贺同志们在直接调查美帝国主义细菌战罪行的重大的工作中，获得圆满的成就。
    接着朝鲜祖国战线代表郑圣彦致欢迎辞。他说：各位的来访已引起了全世界人民的注视，因为各位将根据直接调查的确凿证据，向全世界揭露美国侵略者的滔天罪行。美国侵略者为挽回败局和企图扩大侵略战争而公然使用细菌武器，这绝不可能吓倒朝鲜人民。敌人越残暴，朝鲜人民越憎恨敌人。朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联人民、中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈支援下必将取得最后胜利，人类的公敌——美帝国主义者一定要受到新的纽伦堡法庭的严厉的正义裁判。
    李德全团长致答词。她说：我们调查团来到英勇的战斗的朝鲜已经半个多月了。我们的团员们一部分参加了对于敌人撒布带有细菌的毒虫毒物的检验工作，一部分分组到敌人撒布毒虫毒物的现场进行了实地调查，访问了当地军民中的目击者和见证人。我们检验的结果和我们实地调查所得到的材料，已十分确凿地证实了美帝国主义在朝鲜前线和后方大规模进行细菌战的事实。我们回到中国后，将会同本团的东北分团一起写成调查报告，向全世界一切正义人士控诉美帝国主义违背人道灭绝人性的滔天罪行。
    李德全说：美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北等地进行细菌战是在政治上一个惨重的失败。现在全世界人民都清楚地看到了一个事实：如果美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的罪恶行为受不到全世界人民的严惩和制止，那么今天中朝人民受到的灾害，明天就会落到全世界人民的头上。正因为如此，全世界范围的抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的怒火，已炽烈地燃烧起来了。在世界和平民主的堡垒——苏联和东欧各新民主主义国家的城镇和乡村的广大人民，纷纷集会向美国侵略者提出严重的抗议。在印度、缅甸、伊朗、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家，在法国、意大利、英国、芬兰、丹麦等资本主义国家以至美帝国主义严密控制下的拉丁美洲国家中的人民，也都对美帝国主义这一罪恶行为发出了正义的声讨。英勇的朝鲜朋友们，我们的反细菌战的战线是空前强大的，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都和我们在一起。因为他们知道中朝人民反细菌战的彻底胜利，也就是全世界人民保卫和平事业的胜利。
    李德全并说：美国侵略者自一月二十八日开始在朝鲜前线和后方撒布带有细菌的毒虫毒物以来，到三月二十五日的不完全统计，已达三百二十二次之多，敌人撒布毒虫毒物的地区是相当广阔的，其居心是十分狠毒的。敌人所撒布的毒虫、毒物中含有毒性强烈的鼠疫杆菌，有极易传染和危害人民的伤寒、副伤寒、霍乱、痢疾等病菌及其他病毒等。这些事实应引起我们最大的警惕。我们必须充分认识：反对美帝国主义进行细菌战是一个长期的艰苦的斗争，如存有丝毫麻痹的思想，都是有害的。我们要随时注视着敌人的阴谋诡计，并随时准备予以击破。由于朝鲜人民和朝中人民军队有周密的有组织的防疫措施，我们已有效地控制并防止了敌人所梦想的疫病流行。我们在反对美帝国主义细菌战的斗争中，已取得了第一个回合的胜利。我们还必须再接再厉、不骄不躁地在现有胜利的基础上，取得反细菌战的彻底胜利。
    继由调查团团员曾昭抡讲话，他说：美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上的军事赌博是失败了，它现在想用灭绝人性的细菌战来挽救它的失败命运也是徒然的，朝鲜人民和中朝部队必然能够彻底粉碎它的细菌战及一切恶毒阴谋。
    大会始终在热烈友好团结和充满胜利信心的气氛中进行。
