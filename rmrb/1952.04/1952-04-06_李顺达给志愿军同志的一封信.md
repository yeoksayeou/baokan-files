    Li Shunda's Letter to the Volunteer Army Comrades

    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:

    I have received more than thirty letters from comrades like Wang Lianqi and Yao Yuxi. Each of your letters has increased our enthusiasm for production. All the peasant brothers in our village salute you.

    Dear comrades, you defeated the American devils in Korea, defended the motherland, and enabled us to engage in production with peace of mind. Inspired by your fighting spirit, the peasant brothers across the country achieved great victories in agricultural production last year. This year, in response to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," we have launched a nationwide patriotic production increase competition, striving for an even greater harvest this year. On March 31st, our Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, along with the agricultural production cooperatives of Geng Changsuo, Han En, Jin Shilong, Lü Hongbin, Li Tianying, Su Dianxuan, and the Puzhongzhi mutual aid team, jointly issued a challenge to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers across the country for a comprehensive increase in production. (The content of the challenge letter can be found in the People's Daily on April 2nd.)

    Our production cooperative was expanded and reorganized from mutual aid teams last winter. Our village is in a mountainous area with very little arable land, so in addition to farming, we also engage in forestry and animal husbandry. The entire cooperative has twenty households with 159.5 mu of cultivated land. Our production increase plan is as follows: 1. The average yield per mu of farmland in the cooperative will reach 423 jin, an increase of 53 jin compared to last year (i.e., an increase of 14.3%), which is 48 jin more than the average yield per mu stipulated in the village's production increase plan for this year; 2. On ten mu of high-yield land, five mu will be planted with "Golden Queen" corn, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and five mu will be planted with millet, with a yield of 600 jin per mu. To achieve these two goals, we plan to plow, rake, harrow, and hoe all autumn fields three times each. Sixty percent of all farmland will receive topdressing fertilizer and use new-style farm tools for deep plowing. Planting and fertilizing will be done according to local conditions. Each mu of land will be fertilized with 110 dan of manure (the ten mu of high-yield land will be fertilized with 130 dan). Extensive soil improvement work will be carried out. This year, at least twenty mu of land will be specially processed, and 200 side embankments will be repaired. All cultivated land will use improved varieties, and seeds will be treated with chemicals before sowing. To improve technology, 1.5 mu of land will be set aside as a "small farm" for breeding experiments. 3. Vigorously develop forestry and animal husbandry. Plant 1,000 fruit trees and 500 timber trees. Afforest 100 mu. Add half a mu of small nursery. Breed eight more head of livestock. Raise one head of breeding stock. Plant a portion of alfalfa to increase feed. Buy thirty sheep. Increase five pigs and one hundred chickens.

    In leading all members to achieve the above plans, we intend to do the following: 1. Strengthen current affairs, political, and cultural studies to raise everyone's political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm. Conscientiously implement and promptly check and revise patriotic covenants. 2. Subscribe to two copies of the Shanxi Peasant Daily, one copy of the Shanxi Daily, and one copy of the People's Daily. Each production team will have two propagandists. Combine the production team and the newspaper reading group to conduct regular propaganda and mobilization. 3. Regularly educate the members about the prospects of socialism. Introduce the life and advanced experience of Soviet collective farmers to give everyone a long-term vision. 4. Strengthen democratic life within the cooperative, regularly inspect work, and conduct seasonal summaries and "comparisons" for rewards and criticisms.

    Dear comrades, in addition to our production cooperative, the other four mutual aid teams in our village have also formulated plans to comprehensively increase yield per unit area this year. In order to do a good job in preferential treatment work, all village cadres and representatives of military families held a meeting in the first month of the lunar calendar to discuss the issue of substitute cultivation and formulated improved methods. Everyone will strive to "prioritize the families of martyrs and military personnel, then ourselves" in production. We must ensure that the production and living standards of the families of martyrs and military personnel are the same as the masses.

    Dear comrades, in the last letter from Comrade Yao Yuxi and Li Yunfeng, first-class merit recipients from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, they proposed to engage in a patriotic competition with us in different work positions. I am willing to accept the challenge from comrades Yao and Li. Let us work together in the front and the rear to build the motherland and defend world peace. I wish you good health!

    李顺达给志愿军同志的一封信亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    我先后收到了王连岐、姚玉玺等同志的三十多封来信。你们的每一封信，都增加了我们的生产劲头。我们全村的农民兄弟，都向你们致敬。
    亲爱的同志们，你们在朝鲜打败了美国鬼子，保卫了祖国，使我们能够安心生产。全国的农民兄弟，受了你们的战斗精神的鼓舞，在去年的农业生产上取得了很大的胜利。今年，我们响应毛主席“增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，已经发起全国性的爱国增产竞赛，争取今年更大的丰收。三月三十一日，我们的农林畜牧生产合作社、耿长锁、韩恩、金时龙、吕鸿宾、李田英、苏殿选等的农业生产合作社和蒲忠智互助组，联名向全国的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民发出了全面增产的挑战书。（挑战书的内容，见四月二日人民日报。）
    我们的生产合作社是去年冬天由互助组扩大改组成的。我们村是山地，耕地很少，因此我们除种地外，还经营林业和畜牧业。全社有二十户，耕地一百五十九亩五分。我们的增产计划是这样的：一、全社农田每亩平均产量达到四百二十三斤，比去年增产五十三斤（即增产百分之十四点三），比全村今年增产计划中规定的每亩平均产量多四十八斤；二、十亩丰产地，五亩种“金皇后”玉茭，每亩产量一千斤，五亩谷子，每亩产量六百斤。为了实现这两项计划，我们准备全部秋田要做到耕、耢、耙、锄各三遍。全部农田百分之六十上追肥和采用新式农具，进行深耕。因地种植，因地施肥。每亩地施肥一百一十担（十亩丰产地要施肥一百三十担）。大量进行土壤改良工作。今年最少要将二十亩地特殊加工，修边岸二百道。全部耕地采用优良品种，播种前进行药剂拌种。为了提高技术，辟一亩五分地做“小农场”，进行良种试验。三、大量发展林业牧业。植果树一千株，木材树五百株。造林一百亩。新增小苗圃半亩。繁殖牲口八头。养种畜一头。种苜蓿草一部，以增加饲料。买羊三十只。增加猪五口、鸡一百只。
    在领导全体社员实现上述计划中，我们准备这样做：一、加强时事、政治和文化学习，提高大家的政治觉悟和爱国热情。认真执行和及时检查、修订爱国公约。二、订山西农民报两份，山西日报一份，人民日报一份。每个生产组设两名宣传员。把生产小组和读报组结合起来，经常进行宣传鼓动。三、经常向社员进行关于社会主义前途的教育。介绍苏联集体农民的生活和先进经验，使大家有远大的眼光。四、加强社内民主生活，经常检查工作，按季节总结“评比”，进行奖励和批评。
    亲爱的同志们，我们村除了我们的生产合作社之外，其他四个互助组也都订出了今年的全面提高单位面积产量的计划。为了做好优抚工作，全村干部和军属代表在阴历正月开了会，讨论了代耕问题，订出了改进办法，大家要做到在生产中“先烈属、军属，后自己”。我们一定要使烈属、军属的生产水平和生活水平与群众一样。
    亲爱的同志们，上次志愿军某部一等功臣姚玉玺、李云峰两同志的来信中，提出愿意和我们在不同的工作岗位上展开爱国主义的竞赛。我愿意向姚、李两同志应战。咱们前方后方一齐努力，共同建设祖国，保卫世界和平。祝你们身体健康！
