Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th -- The Korean People's Army coastal defense unit, defending the east coast of Korea, valiantly and resourcefully sank three enemy destroyers and one torpedo boat, and damaged three enemy destroyers in the nineteen days from mid-February to early March.

　　One evening in mid-February, several enemy destroyers approached the coastal defense unit's position and carried out a frenzied bombardment. The unit's gunners retaliated angrily. They unleashed fierce fire, hitting an enemy destroyer, which immediately began to emit thick smoke. The remaining enemy ships, not daring to linger, hurriedly protected the damaged enemy ship and fled.

　　After this victory, Zheng Yingqiao, the chairman of the Democratic Youth League organization of the unit, shouted to the gunners: "Comrades! The battle is not over, it has only just begun! We have all sworn that we would rather sacrifice ourselves than let the American pirates run rampant. Make full preparations and send the invading enemies to the bottom of the sea!" His call further inspired the gunners' high morale. The gunners were busy replenishing ammunition, preparing for the enemy's return.

　　Sure enough, at daybreak, a large number of enemy ships and swarms of fighter planes came menacingly for revenge. The smoke of enemy bombs and shells filled the coast. The People's Army shooters calmly adjusted their firing range in their solid shelters, waiting for the enemy ships to approach. Soon, one enemy destroyer and one torpedo boat entered the firing range of a certain artillery team. In an instant, three earth-shattering cannon sounds rang out from the position. The enemy destroyer's hull was hit by shells, emitting smoke, and began to sink sideways.

　　"Keep up the good work!" The gunners cheered and continued to fire fierce fire at the enemy ships. The torpedo boat within the firing range was also sunk. The anti-aircraft gunners, who closely coordinated with the gunners, shot down one enemy plane and damaged two enemy planes while the gunners were sinking the enemy ships. The enemy ships and aircraft spent countless bombs and more than 3,500 shells, achieving nothing, but suffered serious losses, and had to flee in a panic.

　　On March 5, the enemy sent two more destroyers to harass. Cai Zaiyuan, the aimer of the second gun of a certain artillery team of the unit, immediately aimed and fired as soon as he spotted the enemy ships. He hit the enemy ship with just a few shells. The other guns also hit the same target, and the enemy ship began to sink after being hit. The enemy ship behind hurriedly came to rescue, but was also severely attacked by the People's Army coastal defense forces' artillery fire and was hit and wounded. The ship had to turn around and flee south.

　　A few days later, enemy ships came to harass again. In the fierce battle, the gunners of the unit, who were getting stronger and stronger, achieved another victory by sinking and damaging one enemy destroyer each.

　　The Korean People's Army gunners defend the motherland's coast with such valiant and resourceful battles, mocking the enemy's so-called "air and sea superiority." They are full of confidence and determined to inflict heavier blows on the US imperialists who persist in aggression!

    朝鲜海防部队击沉击伤敌舰七艘
    【新华社平壤十日电】保卫着朝鲜东海岸的朝鲜人民军海防部队某部，在二月中到三月初的十九天中，英勇机智地击沉敌驱逐舰三艘和鱼雷艇一艘，击伤敌驱逐舰三艘。
    二月中旬的一天晚上，敌驱逐舰数艘迫近该海防部队阵地，进行疯狂炮击。该部炮手们愤怒地予以还击。他们发出猛烈的炮火，击中敌驱逐舰一艘，该舰顿时冒出浓烟，其余的敌舰不敢恋战，慌忙护住那艘已受伤的敌舰逃窜。
    这一战斗胜利结束后，该部队的民主青年同盟组织的委员长郑英桥高声地对炮手们说：“同志们！战斗不是结束了，而是才开始！我们都已宣过誓，宁愿牺牲，不让美国海贼逞凶。作充分的准备，把来犯的敌人送到海底去！”他的呼声更加鼓舞起炮手们高昂的斗志。炮手们忙着补充炮弹，防备敌人的再犯。
    果然，天一亮，敌大批舰艇和成群的战斗机气势汹汹地来报复了。敌人的炸弹和炮弹的硝烟，弥漫在海岸上。人民军的射手们镇定地在坚固的掩蔽部里校正着射击距离，等待敌舰的迫近。不久，敌驱逐舰和鱼雷艇各一艘进入了某炮队的火力圈。一刹那间，阵地上响起三响震天动地的炮声。敌驱逐舰的腹部就被炮弹击中冒烟，侧着身子开始往下沉。
   “加油干啊！”炮手们一面欢呼，一面继续向敌舰艇发出炽烈的炮火。在火力圈内的鱼雷艇跟着也被击沉。和炮手们紧密配合作战的对空射击手们，在炮手们轰沉敌舰的同时，也击落敌机一架，击伤敌机两架。敌舰艇飞机花费了无数炸弹和三千五百多发炮弹，一无所获，反而遭受严重损失，只好狼狈地逃走了。
    三月五日，敌人又派遣驱逐舰两艘前来骚扰。该部某炮队第二炮的瞄准手蔡载元发现敌舰后，立刻敏捷地首先瞄准射击，没有用几发炮弹，就击中了敌舰。其余的炮也射中了同一目标，敌舰中弹后，即开始下沉。后面的那艘敌舰急忙驶来抢救，但也受到人民军海防部队炮火的痛击，中弹受伤。该舰不得不转身向南逃遁。
  几天之后，敌舰又来骚扰，愈战愈强的该部炮手们在激烈的战斗中，又取得了击沉、击伤敌驱逐舰各一艘的胜利。
    朝鲜人民军炮手们就以这样的英勇机智的战斗保卫着祖国的海岸，嘲笑着敌人所吹嘘的所谓“海空优势”。他们充满信心，决心给予坚持侵略的美帝国主义以更沉重的打击！
