(Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch) According to TASS, Moscow: The International Economic Conference held its final meeting on the evening of the 12th. Nan Hanchen (China) served as chairman.

Professor Taublaetzberg (Austria), on behalf of the presidium, submitted a draft of the International Economic Conference's letter to the UN General Assembly for review. The letter to the UN General Assembly suggested convening a conference of government representatives from all countries as soon as possible, inviting representatives from business, labor unions, and other social organizations to participate, in order to promote the expansion of international trade. Taublaetzberg drew everyone's attention to the fact that participants in the International Economic Conference had pointed out the great difficulties encountered in international trade. However, they believed that several measures could be taken to improve the current situation. According to Article 55 of the UN Charter, the United Nations can participate in the solution of such problems. In order to promote the expansion of international trade, convening a conference with representatives from both UN member states and non-UN member states is in line with the UN Charter and is achievable.

Professor Daftari (Iran), authorized by the presidium, read out a proposal on the establishment of an International Trade Promotion Committee. He explained the reasons for the proposal, saying: The International Economic Conference is undoubtedly a good idea, because this conference has enabled those who came here from countries with different economic systems to express their views. The exchange of views among the representatives of various countries at the meeting has clearly presented a most regrettable picture of the current economic situation. Daftari pointed out: At the same time, we have understood here the potential strength of various countries in trade, and have discussed ways to overcome the difficulties encountered by various countries. Therefore, this conference is a good start. So the presidium decided to propose that this beneficial undertaking be continued and to submit a draft proposal on the establishment of an International Trade Promotion Committee.

Chamberlain, Secretary-General of the International Economic Conference, then presented a communiqué draft summarizing the general results of the International Economic Conference, requesting its adoption by the plenary session. Chamberlain pointed out: It is a matter of congratulation that representatives from business, cooperatives, and trade unions from so many countries attended the International Economic Conference. We have exchanged views here on an extremely wide range of topics. We conducted frank discussions, and people representing various interest groups from different countries with different economic and social systems could freely exchange their views during the discussion. We can be proud that the International Economic Conference has shown that there are unlimited opportunities for the development of trade between countries, and has emphasized that differences in economic and social systems will not hinder the restoration and development of trade between countries. This trade must be strengthened. We emphasize in this communiqué that all participants in this International Economic Conference are willing to convene a second International Economic Conference.

After the above three documents were read out, representatives from India and Pakistan put forward amendments, pointing out that international trade should be based on equality between both parties and should attach importance to the special needs of the developing industries of backward countries. Their amendments were unanimously adopted by the audience.

The plenary session then adopted the letter to the UN General Assembly, the decision on the establishment of the International Trade Promotion Committee, and the communiqué of the Moscow International Economic Conference. When the chairman announced that these documents had been unanimously adopted by the audience, those present responded with loud and sustained applause.

After a break, the meeting continued, chaired by Professor Chand (India).

The attendees elected the members of the International Trade Promotion Committee.

Next, Lord Boyd-Orr (Great Britain) delivered a speech, thanking the initiating committee and the Soviet hosts—the Soviet Preparatory Committee—for their contribution to the success of the conference. He emphasized: We have accomplished great work at this meeting. From the British delegation's point of view, we have made very important contacts, which will expand international trade and will help raise our living standards, or at least help prevent the decline of our living standards. He said: The International Economic Conference is a historic event.

Nesterov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Chamber of Commerce, said: The number of attendees, their qualifications, and their activities during the meeting, their attentive concern for all the speeches—all this reflects everyone's willingness to seek various practical ways to expand international trade. The various opinions expressed in the conference hall allow us to say that in terms of economic cooperation, there are many opportunities to find contact between representatives of different countries and between various countries, regardless of their economic and political systems. Nesterov finally hoped that the attendees would work smoothly in accordance with the guidelines planned by the conference.

Lanki (Poland) then spoke, saying: We all thank the Soviet government for making it possible for this conference to be held in the Soviet capital. We also thank the Soviet Preparatory Committee, the leaders of Moscow, and the residents of Moscow who "warmly welcomed us everywhere." Lanki emphasized: The practical significance of our conference is that it has opened up prospects for the future. It shows the vast possibilities for developing international trade and international economic cooperation.

After emphasizing that the International Economic Conference had unanimously adopted its documents, Professor Chand immediately announced the successful conclusion of the conference.

    国际经济会议胜利闭幕
    通过致联合国大会书建议促进国际贸易
    决定成立国际贸易促进委员会
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际经济会议在十二日晚间举行末次会议。由南汉宸（中国）担任主席。
    陶布莱茨伯格教授（奥地利）代表主席团将国际经济会议致联合国大会书草稿提交会议审议。致联合国大会书建议尽早召开各国政府代表会议，邀请一切国家的实业界、工会和其他社会团体的代表参加，以促进国际贸易的扩大。陶布莱茨伯格唤起大家的注意说：参加国际经济会议的人已指出了在国际贸易方面所碰到的极大困难。但是他们认为可以采取若干措施来改善当前的局势。依照联合国宪章第五十五条，联合国可以参与这类问题的解决。为了促进国际贸易的扩大，召开由联合国会员国与非联合国会员国都派代表参加的会议，是与联合国宪章相符合的，而且是可以办得到的。
    达夫塔里教授（伊朗）由主席团授权，宣读关于成立国际贸易促进委员会的建议。他阐明提出这个建议的理由说：国际经济会议无疑地是一种好主意，因为这次会议已使那些从不同经济制度的国家来这里参加会议的人，能够表明各自的观点。各国代表们在会议上交换的意见，已使一幅最令人遗憾的当前经济情势的画面清楚地呈现出来。达夫塔里指出：同时，我们在这里已明白了各国在贸易方面的潜在力量，并且已研讨了克服各国所遇到的困难的方法。因此这次会议是一个良好的开端。所以主席团决定提议把这种有益的事业继续保持下去，并向大家提出关于成立国际贸易促进委员会的建议草案。
    国际经济会议秘书长香贝朗接着提出了总结国际经济会议一般成果的公报草案，请求全体会议通过。香贝朗指出：这么多国家的实业界、合作社和工会工作者的代表出席了国际经济会议，这是大家可以庆幸的事情。我们在这里已就极端广泛的范围交换了意见。我们进行了坦率的讨论，代表各种利益集团的来自不同经济制度与社会制度的不同国家的人们，在讨论的过程中，可以十分自由地交换了各自的观点。我们可以引为荣幸，因为国际经济会议已显示出各国间的贸易发展有无限机会，并且已强调指出：经济制度与社会制度的不同，决不会妨碍各国间通商的恢复和发展。这种通商必须予以加强。我们在这个公报中着重指出：这次国际经济会议的全体参加者都愿意召开第二次国际经济会议。
    上述三项文件宣读完毕后，印度和巴基斯坦代表提出了修正案，指出国际贸易应以双方平等、并重视落后国家正在发展着的工业的特别需要为基础。他们的修正案获得全场一致通过。
    全体会议继通过了致联合国大会书、关于成立国际贸易促进委员会的决定，以及莫斯科国际经济会议的公报。当主席宣布这些文件已得到全场一致通过时，到会者报以响亮的经久不息的掌声。
    会议经休息之后继续举行，由昌德教授（印度）担任主席。
    到会者选出了国际贸易促进委员会的委员。
    接着，波以德—奥尔勋爵（英国）发表演说，感谢发起人委员会和苏联的主人——苏联筹备委员会——对于大会获得成功所作的贡献。他强调指出：我们在这次会议上完成了伟大的工作。从英国代表团的观点看来，我们作了非常重要的接触，这种接触将扩大国际贸易，并将帮助提高我国的生活水准，或者至少是帮助防止我国生活水准的下降。他说：国际经济会议是一件具有历史意义的大事。
    全苏商会主席奈斯特洛夫发言说：到会人数，他们的资格以及在会议进行期间的活动，他们对所有演说的关心注意——这一切都反映出大家是愿意寻求各种实际的途径来扩大国际贸易的。在会议厅中所表示的各种意见使我们可以这样说：就经济合作而言，在不同国家的代表之间，在各个国家之间，不管它们的经济与政治制度如何，是可以找到许多接触的机会的。奈斯特洛夫最后希望到会者依照会议所规划的方针顺利地进行工作。
    兰基（波兰）接着发言说：我们大家感谢苏联政府使这个会议得以在苏联首都举行。我们也感谢苏联筹备委员会、莫斯科的领袖们，以及“到处热诚欢迎我们”的莫斯科居民。兰基强调说：我们这次会议的实际意义乃是它为未来开拓了前途。它显示了发展国际贸易与国际经济合作的广大可能性。
    昌德教授在强调指出国际经济会议是一致通过它的文件之后，随即宣布会议胜利闭幕。
