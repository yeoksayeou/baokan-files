    Yellow River Spring Repairs Fully Underway

    The Yellow River's spring dike repair project has fully commenced this year. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, along the banks of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, over ten thousand laborers are already working on the dikes. They are engaged in a patriotic labor competition along more than two thousand *li* of the Yellow River dikes. This year's spring dike repair project involves a total earthwork volume of over 6.5 million cubic meters, with the aim of reinforcing the dikes to ensure they do not collapse even when the flood flow at Shaanzhou reaches 23,000 cubic meters per second.

    Before the start of this year's spring project, the Yellow River Conservancy Commissions of the provinces along the river had made thorough preparations. As a result, the project is progressing rapidly since its commencement, and it is expected that the entire construction plan will be completed by the end of May. The cadres and laborers working on the dikes have shown very high levels of enthusiasm. Many model workers who have been involved in Yellow River management for years have initiated challenge competitions. This year, the efficiency of earthwork operations is to be universally improved, and the laborers have launched a "Ten Cubic Meter Movement," meaning that each person should transport an average of ten cubic meters of earth per day. Currently, many labor teams have already reached or exceeded this goal.

    In addition, near the Shitou Zhuang flood diversion weir in Changyuan County, Pingyuan Province (completed last year), there are now 2,400 laborers, under the leadership of the Yellow River Engineering Team, rushing to build stone revetments and water diversion control dikes.

    黄河春修全面开始
    今年的黄河春季修堤工程已经全面开工，河南、平原、山东三省黄河中、下游沿岸已有十多万民工上堤，他们在二千多华里长的黄河堤线上，展开了爱国劳动竞赛。今年河堤春修工程的土方共计为六百五十多万公方，要把河堤加固到陕州洪水流量达到二万三千秒公方时确保不致溃决。
    今年春季工程开始前，沿河各省黄河河务局，都曾进行了充分的准备工作。因此，动工后工程进展很快，预计五月底就可完成全部施工计划。上堤的干部和民工劳动热情都十分高涨，许多历年治黄的劳动模范已发起了挑战竞赛。今年土方工作效率要普遍提高，民工们已展开了一个“十方运动”，即每人每天要运土平均达到十公方。现在，不少民工队已经达到了或超过了这个目标。
    另外，平原省长垣县石头庄溢洪堰（去年修成的）附近，现在也有两千四百多民工在黄河工程队的领导下，赶修石护岸和导水控制堤。
