Northeast Literary and Art Workers Association Vice Chairman Cao Ming

    Julius Fučík wrote in "Report from the Gallows": "I love life, and I fight for it. ... I was born for joy, and I will die for joy..." Yes, his life proved that he fought against the forces of darkness for the joy of mankind, even sacrificing his life. His heroic poems, his great deeds, have touched the hearts of so many!—These people are not only Czechs, but also Russians, Chinese, Indians, as well as all conscientious people in Britain, the United States, France, and other countries around the world. People will sincerely thank, respect, and take as their example those heroes who sacrifice themselves for the happiness of mankind and the liberation of nations. We fully understand this feeling.

    However, there are people in the world who are incomprehensible: they are studying how to kill more people with the least amount of money. On October 18, 1950, behind the People's Committee building in Sinchon City, Korea, nine hundred men and women were burned to death by American devils, including three hundred children and pregnant women. But this kind of trick is no longer new and cannot satisfy those blood-drinking beasts. Now, they also want to use spreading plague bacteria to kill more Koreans and Chinese. They say that when people die, the factories and mines in Korea and China will belong to the United States. - Truman, Acheson, Lovett, Ridgway and their ilk, as well as their accomplices who hope to suck some blood, the scum of Japan, West Germany, and Britain, are dreaming this dream.

    The closer imperialism gets to its demise, the more vicious and despicable its methods become. They shamelessly and openly discuss the function of atomic bombs and germ bombs in mass murder. The New York Herald Tribune once made a shameless cry: "We will supply those aircraft not only with bombs—atomic bombs, incendiary bombs, germ bombs, but also with hydrogen bombs, so that they can kill babies in cradles, old people praying, and hard-working people at high altitudes." Although this carries an element of intimidation, it also exposes their barbaric essence and that the targets of their slaughter are peaceful people of all countries, especially children, women, and the elderly. Wall Street bosses and their accomplices are no longer human, they are beasts, the most ferocious beasts, using science to kill people. Yes, this war is a war between humans and beasts, I understand.

    Who will win? Let the people speak. The World Peace Council, representing the will of the people of the world, the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing 78 million trade union members, the International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 135 million women in 62 countries, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing 72 million young men and women in 84 countries, have all issued solemn statements strongly protesting the American aggressors' germ warfare. The people of all countries have roared in unison.

    When I went to Kuandian with the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism," I heard farmer Wang Fangqi accuse: "Sixteen years ago, Japanese devils experimented with the plague in Kuandian, and the common people generally suffered from typhoid fever, and nine out of ten people fell ill. Some families of seven or eight people died. At that time, my family of three fell ill one after another. I hate it so much when I think of it. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us to live a good life; who would have thought that the American devils would come to spread germs again, trying to make our families ruined, no grains grow, and no livestock reproduce. We can't let that happen, we want peace, we want to live a good life, we have the power to crush the American devils' germ warfare! We have Chairman Mao, we have ways to do everything. Don't be afraid." Wang Fangqi, like hundreds of millions of Chinese people, understood the essence of imperialism and fully estimated their own strength.

    Bao Lirong, the nine-year-old granddaughter of a power worker in Fushun, died of encephalitis virus spread by American imperialism. When the investigation team visited, their whole family cried. The deceased's twelve-year-old sister, Bao Lijun, told the investigation team: "That day, my three siblings were playing very well, but my younger sister fell ill in the evening and died the next day. My mother made three pairs of shoes for us, all the same. My younger sister died of a terrible disease, and my mother was afraid that the American germs would harm us, so she burned her shoes as well. But, look, my little brother's and my shoes are still here, and they are still quite new. The Americans killed my sister, and I want to ask the investigation team to accuse them to the people of the world to avenge my sister." Listen, her voice is the cry of millions of children. They have made demands on all fathers, mothers, and all adults. Not only China and Korea have hundreds of millions of children, but every country and every nation has countless lovely children. If we neglect our responsibility to protect them, we will receive an unforgivable condemnation.

    Enough, the above examples prove that the people of the world hate the murderers who use germ warfare for mass murder, and those fascists who have tainted the field of science.
    Julius Fučík and thousands of revolutionary martyrs sacrificed themselves to eradicate those murderers for the people. And thousands upon thousands of warriors defending world peace are engaged in a brutal battle to defeat these man-eating beasts. No matter how vicious and terrifying the enemy's methods are, the world's people still sing the praises of heroines like the Soviet heroine Zoya's unyielding spirit; and figures like Dong Cunrui, who sacrificed himself to blow up the pillbox. People are grateful to Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save a drowning Korean boy; and thousands of Chinese People's Volunteers who support the Korean people. People will always remember Dr. Bethune, who shed his last drop of blood for the liberation of China, whose name alone inspired the soldiers to fight more bravely. There is also the Soviet Red Army that liberated the countries of Eastern Europe and liberated Northeast China, and the Soviet anti-epidemic team that selflessly fought to eradicate the plague left behind by Japanese imperialism. ...

    Some people are willing to sacrifice themselves to save one person, or rescue many people. But there are also such "people" who kill large numbers of people in order to satisfy their unlimited greed for wealth. - This is the dividing line between humans and beasts, and also the dividing line between justice and barbarism. But there is no doubt that the people are always the majority, and the beasts are the very few; the power of the people is great, and the rampage of the beasts is only temporary; justice is always welcomed and supported by the people, while barbarism is infamous for ten thousand years.

    Humans will defeat beasts, and justice will defeat barbarism, there is no doubt about it.

    We believe in this, so we can understand many inspiring facts: Li Hongen, a worker at the Second Machinery Factory in Northeast China, immediately turned anger into strength after the United States spread insects carrying bacteria, and shortened the working hours of making a retaining ring by seventy minutes. The workers of the Second Branch of the Sixth Paper Mill, who have created a record of 6,000 hours of safe production, completed the production task for the first quarter five days ahead of schedule. The paper loss rate was also reduced by another 0.4 percent. Liu Jinliang, a worker at the Fushun Power Industry, known for reducing coal consumption, and his model team, absorbed advanced Soviet experience and implemented rapid boiler repairs, shortening the working hours by half to respond to the vicious provocations of American imperialism. Three hours after the mobilization meeting against germ warfare, the staff and workers of a certain mine created a flamethrower and quickly and effectively exterminated poisonous insects. This year, the peasants are also particularly active in spring ploughing. They not only propose to guarantee the extermination of poisonous insects, but also vow to smash the enemy's germ warfare with increased production and bumper harvests. Medical workers, scientific workers, and literary and art workers have all organized themselves to participate in the anti-germ warfare. Women in rural areas, factories, streets, and maternal and child health stations have all organized themselves. Women, whose natural duty is to protect children, have shown particularly heroic and active participation in the anti-germ warfare. Aunt Liu, a worker's family member in Andong, said: "We keep an account of how many poisonous insects we catch every day, and we will settle the general account with the American devils sooner or later."

    What has been said above is only a part of the strength of the people of Northeast China who are standing on the front line of the anti-germ warfare. There are countless people in China, Korea, and the world who support heroes such as Fučík, Zoya, Dong Cunrui, Luo Shengjiao, and Bethune; and people who continue to fight in their footsteps. If these forces are added together and closely united, then we can restrain the hands of the American barbarians stained with the blood of good people.

### 制止美国侵略者的暴行

    制止美国侵略者的暴行
    东北文艺工作者协会副主席  草明
    尤利斯·伏契克在“绞索套着脖子时的报告”里写道：“我爱生活，并且为它而战斗。……我为欢乐而生，为欢乐而死……”是的，他的一生，证明他为了人类的欢乐而和黑暗势力战斗，以至献出了他的生命。他的英雄的诗篇，他的伟大的行为曾经感动过多少人的心弦！——这些人不仅是捷克人，还有苏联人、中国人、印度人以及英国、美国、法国和世界各国一切有良心的人。对于那些为人类的幸福，为民族的解放而不惜自我牺牲的英雄们，人们会衷心感激他们，尊崇他们，并以他们做自己的榜样。这种心情我们十分理解。
    但是，世界上居然有一种人是叫人不可理解的：他们正在研究怎样花最少的钱，来杀死更多的人民。一九五○年十月十八日在朝鲜信川市人民委员会的大厦后面，九百名男女被美国鬼烧杀，其中包括三百名儿童，还有孕妇。但是，这种玩艺儿已经不新鲜了，不能满足那些喝血的野兽了。现在，他们还要拿散播瘟疫细菌来杀死更多的朝鲜人和中国人。他们说，人死了，将来朝鲜和中国的工厂和矿山都是美国的。——做这种梦的是杜鲁门、艾奇逊、罗维特、李奇微之流，还有他们那些希望吮点血水的帮凶，日本、西德、和英国里面的那些败类。
    帝国主义越是到了快灭亡的时候，手段就更恶毒和卑鄙。他们无耻地公开讨论原子弹和细菌弹大量杀人的功能。纽约先驱论坛报曾作无耻的叫嚣：“我们将不仅以炸弹——原子弹、烧夷弹、细菌弹，而且更以氢弹供给那些飞机以便它可以在高空去杀死摇篮中的婴孩，正在祈祷的老人和正在做工的劳苦人民。”这虽然带着恐吓的成分，但也暴露出他们野蛮的本质、他们杀戮的对象是世界各国的和平人民，特别是儿童、妇女和老人。华尔街老板和他的帮凶早已经不是人了，他们都是些野兽，最凶猛的，用科学来杀人的野兽。是的，这个战争是人和兽的战争，我理解了。
    谁战胜谁呢？让人民来说话吧。代表全世界人民意志的世界和平理事会，代表七千八百万工会会员的世界工会联合会、代表六十二国一亿三千五百万妇女的国际民主妇女联合会、代表八十四个国家七千二百万男女青年的世界民主青年联盟都发表了庄严的声明，严重抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战。各国人民，同声发出了怒吼。
    我随“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”到宽甸的时候，亲耳听见农民王芳起控诉说：“十六年前，日本鬼子在宽甸试验瘟疫，老百姓普遍闹伤寒病，十个有九个病倒的。也有全家七八口人都死光的。那时我一家大小三口人都相继病倒了。一提起来我就恨极了。解放以后，毛主席领导咱过好日子；谁想到美国鬼子又来撒播病菌，想把我们闹的家破人亡，五谷不长，六畜不生。咱们可不让，咱们要和平，要过好日子，咱们有力量粉碎美国鬼子的细菌战！咱们有毛主席，什么都有办法。不用怕。”王芳起和亿万个中国人一样，洞悉了帝国主义的本质，并充分估计了自己的力量。
    抚顺一个电力工人的九岁孙女儿鲍丽容，染了美帝国主义所撒播的脑炎病毒死亡了。当调查团进行访问时，他们全家哭诉着。死者十二岁的姐姐鲍丽君对调查团诉说道：“那一天我们三姐弟都玩得好好的，晚上妹妹就发了病，第二天就死了。妈妈给我们做的三双鞋子，都是一个样的，妹妹得恶病死了，妈妈怕美国毒菌还害我们，就把她的鞋也烧了。可是，你瞅，我和小弟弟的鞋子还在，还挺新的。美国人害死了我妹妹，我要请调查团向全世界人民控告它，为我妹妹报仇。”请听吧，她的声音，就是千万个儿童的呼吁。她们对所有的父亲、母亲和所有的成年人提出了要求了。不仅中国、朝鲜有亿万的孩子，而各个国家各个民族都有无数可爱的孩子的。如果我们忽视了保护他们的责任，我们将会得到不可饶恕的谴责的。
    够了，上面的例子证明世界人民都仇恨用细菌战大量杀人的凶手，和那些沾污了科学领域的法西斯
    “科学家”们。
    尤利斯·伏契克和千万个革命先烈是为了替人民铲除那些杀人犯们而牺牲的。而万万千千的保卫世界和平的战士们，正为战胜这些吃人野兽而进行着残酷的战斗。不管敌人的手段多么毒辣和恐怖，但是世界人民歌颂的仍是苏联女英雄卓娅式的英勇不屈的英雄；和舍身炸碉堡的董存瑞式的人物。人民感激的是为了拯救快淹死的朝鲜少年而牺牲了自己的罗盛教；和千万个支援朝鲜人民的中国人民志愿军。人民永远怀念的是，只要听见他的名字，战士们就更奋勇作战的，为中国的解放而流尽最后一滴血的白求恩大夫。还有解放东欧各国和解放我国东北的苏联红军，和为扑灭日本帝国主义遗留下来的鼠疫而奋不顾身的苏联防疫队。……
    有人为了救一个人，或抢救很多人而宁愿牺牲自己。但也有这么一种“人”，他们为了满足自己无限制的发财贪欲，而大量杀人。——这就是人和兽的分界线，也是正义和野蛮的分界线。可是毫无疑问的是人民总是多数，野兽是极少数的；人民的力量是伟大的，野兽的横行仅是短暂的；正义永远受人欢迎和拥护，而野蛮是遗臭万年的。
    人战胜野兽，正义战胜野蛮，这是没有疑义的了。
    我们相信了这个，才能理解许多令人振奋的事实：东北第二机械厂工人李洪恩自从美国撒布带有细菌的昆虫后，他立刻把愤怒变成力量，把做一个涨圈的工时缩短了七十分钟。已经创造了六千小时安全生产纪录的造纸六厂二分厂的工友们，提前五天完成了第一季度的生产任务。损纸率也再度降低百分之零点四。以降低燃煤率著称的抚顺电业工人刘金良及其模范班，吸收了苏联的先进经验，实行快速抢修锅炉，以缩短了一半工时来回答美帝国主义的恶毒的挑衅行为。某矿山职工在反细菌战动员大会后三小时，即创造了喷火器，迅速而有效地扑灭毒虫。今年农民们对于春耕也特别积极，他们不仅提出保证扑灭毒虫，并誓以增产丰收来粉碎敌人的细菌战。医药工作者，科学工作者，文艺工作者都已组织起来，参加反细菌战。农村、工厂、街道、妇婴保健站的妇女都已组织起来。以保护儿童为自己的天职的妇女们在反细菌战中表现得特别英勇和积极。安东一位工人家属刘大嫂说：“我们每天捉多少毒虫都记账，早晚要和美国鬼子算总账。”
    上面所讲的，仅是站在反细菌战最前线的东北人民力量的一部分罢了。中国、朝鲜以及全世界，还有难以数计的拥护伏契克，卓娅，董存瑞，罗盛教，白求恩等英雄的人们；和踏着他们的血迹继续战斗的人们。这些力量加起来，紧紧地团结起来，那样，我们就能把染满善良人民的鲜血的美国野蛮人的手扼制住。
