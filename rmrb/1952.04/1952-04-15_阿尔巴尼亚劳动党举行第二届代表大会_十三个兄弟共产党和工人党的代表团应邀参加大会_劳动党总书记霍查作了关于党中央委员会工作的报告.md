Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 12th: According to TASS, the Second Congress of the Albanian Labor Party was held in Tirana from March 31st to April 6th. Delegations from thirteen brother Communist and Workers' parties were invited to attend the congress.

The congress was opened by Kabo, member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee. Subsequently, the congress elected the entire members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party headed by Stalin, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the leaders of thirteen Communist and Workers' Parties from Korea, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Spain, Mongolia, Vietnam and Greece as the Presidium of the congress. A congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party was read out at the meeting, which was greeted with warm and prolonged applause.

The delegates attending the congress listened to and discussed the report on the work of the Party Central Committee delivered by Hoxha, General Secretary of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee; the report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of Albania (1951-1955) by Shehu, Secretary of the Party, and the report of the Party Central Auditing Commission.

The congress adopted a letter to the working people of the whole country, calling on the people to launch a socialist production competition, improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, practice strict economy, and strive to complete the five-year plan. The congress also elected a new Party Central Committee headed by Hoxha, and the Party Central Auditing Commission.

Finally, the congress unanimously adopted a telegram of salute to Stalin.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 12th: According to TASS, Hoxha, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a report on the work of the Party Central Committee at the Second Congress of the Labor Party on March 31st.

In his report, Hoxha first analyzed the characteristics of the current international situation and exposed the sinister conspiracy of American imperialism to use Tito, the Greek and Italian fascists against the Albanian people. He pointed out that major international events demonstrated the weakening of the capitalist system and the deepening of its internal contradictions. The forces of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, are constantly growing stronger. The American aggressors, in order to destroy the will of the Korean people to resist, have even used bacteriological weapons in Korea, but this shows the incompetence of imperialism. It wants to use this to make ordinary people fear, lose confidence and panic, but the people believe that war can be avoided and prevented. Comrade Stalin’s statement that if the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and persist to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated, has become the banner of the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace.

Hoxha then talked about the characteristics of the domestic situation since the last congress. He said that since the last congress, the various sectors of the Albanian national economy have been consolidated. By the end of 1950, the total output value of industry and industrial cooperatives reached 3.266 billion lek (Albanian currency), exceeding the pre-war level of 1938 by 6.3 times. As a result of the implementation of the two-year plan for 1949-1950, industrial production increased by 10.5 percent annually. Agricultural production in 1950 also increased by about 30 percent compared with 1938. National income has increased, and the economic conditions of the working people have improved. The five-year plan, which began in 1951, will be successfully completed on the basis of the achievements we have made in all aspects. The guarantee is not only the various conditions of the Albanian people's democratic system, but also the generous assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

In analyzing the political and economic tasks of the five-year plan, Hoxha emphasized the leading role of the Party in the work of building the socialist foundation of Albania, and elaborated on the issue of further consolidating the Party. He said that the Party correctly led the people and eliminated the threat of Titoism and Trotskyism represented by Hoxha. Since the last congress, the Party has been vigilant and has made relentless attacks on all dissidents and hostile manifestations within the Party. The Party's Marxist-Leninist principles of Party building have strengthened the unity within the Party and consolidated the ties between the grassroots organizations and the leading organs. Party discipline has been consolidated, criticism and self-criticism have been strengthened, and intra-Party democracy has been developed and consolidated. In the future, the Party's central and local leading bodies must take all measures to improve the methods of work and leadership, must pay more attention to holding plenary sessions, delegate meetings, and "seminars," strengthen criticism and self-criticism from below, and consolidate Party discipline without regard to sentiment. The Party's leading organs should pay special attention to improving the theoretical and political level of the staff of all levels of institutions, and must wage a relentless struggle against bureaucrats.

Hoxha's report paid great attention to the struggle against Titoism within the Party. He said: The Belgrade fascists, headed by the traitor Tito, are the most insidious enemies of our Party. We must not forget that Titoism is attacking the loyal members of the Party, the Bolshevik unity, the principles and organizational foundation of the Party, the political line and ideology. At the same time, the right-leaning danger existing within the Party has not disappeared with the elimination of Titoism. It should be considered that the bourgeoisie's pressure on the Party is serious. We should conduct a serious and unremitting struggle against this pressure. Therefore, the Party's revolutionary scale should continue to increase, revolutionary vigilance should be increased day by day, and the struggle against opportunism should be relentless and unconditional.

Hoxha then analyzed the tasks of the Party in the countryside and the consolidation of the people's power. Hoxha said in conclusion: Our heroic Party has been consolidated. Thanks to it, our country has achieved brilliant achievements in economic, social and cultural aspects. Our People's Republic has been consolidated, and the national defense strength has been strengthened. Albania has successfully resisted and will continue to successfully resist the threats of imperialists and their running dogs. Our Party will complete the tasks it shoulders as it has done in the past, because it enjoys the unlimited trust and love of the people. Comrades, raise the banner of proletarian internationalism! Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, move forward towards new victories!

    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社地拉那讯：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第二届代表大会，于三月三十一日到四月六日在地拉那举行。应邀参加大会的有十三个兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团。
    大会由党中央委员会政治局委员卡博主持开幕，接着选出了以斯大林为首的苏联共产党中央委员会政治局全体委员、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，以及朝、匈、捷、法、意、德、保、波、罗、西班牙、蒙古、越南和希腊等十三国共产党和工人党的领袖，为大会主席团。会上宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会的贺电，全场报以热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    出席大会的代表们听取并讨论了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记霍查关于党中央委员会工作的报告；党书记谢胡的关于阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国第
    一个发展国民经济五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的报告，以及党中央监察委员会的报告。
    大会通过了告全国劳动人民书，号召人民展开社会主义生产竞赛，提高劳动生产率、减低生产成本、厉行节约，为完成五年计划而奋斗。大会并选举了以霍查为首的新的党中央委员会，和党中央监察委员会。
    代表大会最后一致通过了向斯大林致敬的电报。
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社地拉那讯：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记霍查，于三月三十一日在劳动党第二届代表大会上，作了关于党中央委员会工作的报告。
    霍查在报告中首先分析了目前国际形势的特点，并且揭露了美帝国主义利用铁托、希腊、意大利法西斯分子反对阿尔巴尼亚人民的罪恶阴谋。他指出：国际上的重大事件说明了资本主义制度削弱了，它的内部矛盾加深了。以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量正在不断增强。美国侵略者为了要摧毁朝鲜人民反抗的意志，竟在朝鲜使用了细菌武器，但这却表明了帝国主义的无能。它想借此使普通人民恐惧、失去信心和惊惶失措，但是人民却相信：战争是可以避免，可以防止的。斯大林同志所说的如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来并且坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固的这句话，已经成为各国人民保卫和平斗争的旗帜。
    霍查接着谈到了自上届代表大会以来国内形势的特点。他说：自从上届大会以来，阿尔巴尼亚国民经济的各个部门已经巩固起来。到一九五○年年底，工业及工业合作社的生产总值达三十二亿六千六百万里克（阿币），超过战前一九三八年水平六点三倍。由于实现了一九四九—一九五○年两年计划的结果，工业生产每年增加百分之十点五。一九五○年农业生产也比一九三八年提高了百分之三十左右。国民收入已经增加，劳动人民的经济状况已经改善了。一九五一年开始实行的五年计划，将以我们在各方面所获得的成就为基础而胜利完成。其保证不仅是阿尔巴尼亚人民民主制度的各种条件，而且还有苏联和人民民主国家的慷慨援助。
    霍查在分析五年计划的政治和经济任务时，强调指出了党在建设阿尔巴尼亚社会主义基础的工作中的领导作用，并详细论述了进一步巩固党的问题。他说：党正确地领导了人民，而且清除了以霍克西为代表的铁托主义和托洛茨基主义的威胁。从上届大会以来，党是警惕着的，并且对党内的一切异己分子和敌对的表现作了无情的反击。党的马克思—列宁主义的建党原则，加强了党内的团结，巩固了基层组织和领导机关的联系。党的纪律巩固起来了，批评与自我批评加强了，党内民主已经展开而且巩固了。今后，党的中央和地方领导机构必须采取一切办法，来改进工作和领导的方法，必须更加注意举行全体会议、代表会议和“习明纳尔”，加强自下而上的批评与自我批评，不顾情面地巩固党的纪律。党的领导机关应该特别注意提高各级机构工作人员的理论和政治水平，必须对官僚主义分子作无情的斗争。
    霍查的报告对于和党内铁托主义作斗争一点予以巨大的注意。他说：以叛徒铁托为首的贝尔格莱德法西斯分子，是我党最阴险的敌人。我们不应忘记，铁托主义正在向党内的忠诚分子、向布尔什维克的团结、向党的原则和组织基础、政治路线和思想进攻。同时，党内所存在的右倾危险，并没有随着铁托主义的清除而消灭。应当认为资产阶级对党的压力是严重的。我们应该对这种压力进行严肃和坚持不渝的斗争。因此，党的革命规模应该不断增大，革命警惕性应该日益提高，对机会主义的斗争应该是无情的、无条件的。
    霍查接着分析了党在农村中的任务和巩固人民政权的问题。霍查在结语中说：我们的英雄的党已经巩固起来了。由于它的缘故，我国在经济、社会和文化各方面都获得了光辉的成就。我们的人民共和国巩固了，国防力量加强了。阿尔巴尼亚曾胜利地抵抗了、而且还将胜利地抵抗帝国主义者及其走狗的威胁。我们的党将和以往一样完成它所肩负的任务，因为它享有人民的无限信任和热爱。同志们，高举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜吧！打着列宁—斯大林的旗帜，迈步向前，走向新的胜利！
