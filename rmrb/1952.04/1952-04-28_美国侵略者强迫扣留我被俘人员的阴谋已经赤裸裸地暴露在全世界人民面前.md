Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 27th: The American aggressors, who in the past month used the confidentiality of the administrative meetings to conceal their conspiracy to detain a large number of our captured personnel, are now nakedly exposed before the people of the world. On the issue of prisoner repatriation, who is right and who is wrong, who is striving to resolve the issue and who is desperately obstructing its resolution, is clearer than ever.

According to the approximate figures presented by the U.S. side at the Fourth Agenda Staff Meeting on April 19th, the U.S. side is only prepared to repatriate 70,000 of our captured personnel. This figure is more than 60,000 less than the total of 132,474 listed in the prisoner of war list officially submitted by the U.S. side on December 18th last year. If we add the more than 44,000 of our captured personnel that the U.S. side has forcibly classified as civilians, the total difference reaches more than 100,000. These 100,000 are the people the U.S. side is attempting to forcibly detain.

On the 25th, the U.S. spokesman Hickman sophistically defended the crime of the U.S. side forcibly detaining tens of thousands of our captured personnel, saying that "the investigation results show that only 70,000 (Korean and Chinese) prisoners are willing to be repatriated." The so-called "investigation" in Hickman's mouth is the vicious "individual interrogation" and "screening" that the American aggressors are conducting on our captured personnel. According to a statement issued by the U.S. military command in Korea on the evening of the 25th, the U.S. side is conducting "individual inquiries" into our captured personnel regarding "whether they are willing to be repatriated" in order to "screen" those who are willing to return and those who are "unwilling to return." However, even this official statement cannot conceal that the "screening" is being conducted in an atmosphere of threats and intimidation. The statement said that in the 24 hours before the "screening," the U.S. military authorities in Korea threatened our captured personnel with "their own safety," demanding that they "not talk to others about this issue (referring to forced detention) before the individual talks are held, nor reveal their decisions." And during the talks, each of our captured personnel was "called in separately for secret talks"; the interrogators were the American aggressors' so-called "highly competent personnel." Under the intimidation of this situation, individual will obviously has no opportunity for free expression, let alone respect for their will. Despite this, due to the resolute and unyielding nature of our captured personnel and their will to be repatriated to their motherland, the American aggressors' shameless "screening" work has obviously failed to achieve the desired results. The April 21st issue of the American "Newsweek" revealed that "a thorough review of the Allied POW camps showed that the number of Communist prisoners who 'refused repatriation' was much smaller than originally estimated." In fact, the U.S. side's so-called "individual inquiry" and "screening" are merely a sham, creating an excuse for forcibly detaining our captured personnel. The American aggressors are deleting the names of our captured personnel that they are prepared to forcibly detain from the list according to their predetermined conspiracy. "Newsweek" confessed: The official list of Communist prisoners is also gradually being reduced, and Washington hopes it can be further reduced. The U.S. side's voluntary repatriation list of our captured personnel, which only includes 70,000 people this time, is obviously fabricated in this way.

After the so-called "screening" work, the American aggressors are changing the detention locations of our captured personnel, dispersing and isolating our captured personnel in order to forcibly detain them. At present, this sinister "dispersal measure" is being carried out on a large scale. According to a report by the Associated Press on April 24th, "In the past five days, at least 15,000 people have been transported away from Geoje Island, and perhaps more will be transported away later." "The six new prisoner camps announced by the United Nations Command can probably accommodate 60,000 prisoners." Prior to this, an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on April 16th had already admitted: "The Allied forces started this new action (referring to 'dispersal measures') probably with an eye on the Panmunjom armistice talks." Obviously, the purpose of this "dispersal measure" is to make it easier for the U.S. side to forcibly detain our captured personnel through intimidation, abuse, and massacre.

The American aggressors' insistence on the demand for "voluntary repatriation" is so stubborn, and their conspiracy is now completely exposed. This absurd demand of the American aggressors also shows that the American aggressors have put the interests of the captured personnel of the United States and its puppet countries and their relatives and friends behind them. Under the pressure of the people, Britain, Canada, France, and other countries have secretly pointed out to the United States that "refusing to repatriate 'all' prisoners of war may violate the Geneva Convention" ("Washington Daily News" on April 10th). Britain also worriedly asked the United States: In order to detain the captured personnel on the Korean and Chinese side, "are we (the US and Britain) going to sacrifice our own captured personnel?" ("Foreign Affairs Report" of Britain on April 3rd). In response, "The U.S. State Department is so far resisting this pressure" ("Washington Daily News" on April 10th). The American aggressors not only deliberately "sacrifice" the captured soldiers of the puppet countries who were once used as cannon fodder for them, but they have also conspired to deal with those American captured soldiers who are dissatisfied with the policy of aggression. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Munsan on the 25th, even if some people "feel anxious about the point of sacrificing some American soldiers in order to forcibly detain the captured personnel on the Korean and Chinese side," "the attitude of the Allied forces still shows no sign of softening." Prior to this, U.S. representative Libby had said on January 21st that according to the principle of "voluntary repatriation," "only completely loyal personnel will be repatriated." A Washington correspondent for the Dentsu news agency revealed on the same day that the U.S. government had prepared concentration camps for those American captured soldiers who failed the "loyalty test."

People also see from the Fourth Agenda Staff Meetings in the past month that our representatives are stepping up their efforts to realize the rational principle of releasing and repatriating all captured personnel of both sides. In order to enable the negotiations to reach an agreement quickly, we not only put forward reasonable and rational compromise adjustment principles regarding the repatriation of prisoners, but also included our newly added prisoners of war in the prisoner of war list, increasing the total number to 12,000, exceeding the number of 11,559 listed in the list submitted on December 18th last year. Our attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness originally provided favorable conditions for reaching an agreement on the fourth agenda. However, due to the U.S. side's sabotage, the negotiations have once again fallen into a stalemate. If the American aggressors continue to insist on their unreasonable demand for "voluntary repatriation," which in essence is a large-scale forced detention of our captured personnel, then they will absolutely not be able to escape the serious responsibility they should bear for delaying and undermining the armistice negotiations.

### 美国侵略者强迫扣留我被俘人员的阴谋已经赤裸裸地暴露在全世界人民面前

    美国侵略者强迫扣留我被俘人员的阴谋已经赤裸裸地暴露在全世界人民面前
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美国侵略者在过去一个月中利用行政性会议的机密性来掩盖它扣留我方大批被俘人员的阴谋，现在已赤裸裸地暴露在世界人民的面前了。在遣返俘虏问题上，谁是谁非，谁在努力求得问题的解决和谁在竭力阻挠问题的解决，是再清楚也没有的事情了。
    根据美方于四月十九日在第四项议程参谋会议上提出的概数，美方准备予以遣返的我方被俘人员仅只七万人。这个数字比美方去年十二月十八日正式提交的战俘名单所列的总数十三万二千四百七十四名，减少了六万人以上，如果加上被美方硬列为平民的我方被俘人员四万四千多人，差额总计达十万人以上，这十万人就是美方企图强行扣留的。
    美方发言人希克曼在二十五日口口声声诡辩美方强行扣留数以万计的我方被俘人员的罪行，说什么“调查结果，只有七万个（朝中方面）俘虏表示愿意被遣返”。希克曼口中的所谓“调查”，也就是美国侵略者在对我方被俘人员进行的恶毒的“个别询问”和“甄别”。据侵朝美军司令部二十五日晚发表的声明透露，美方对我方被俘人员进行“是否愿意被遣返”的“个别询问”，这样来“甄别”那些人愿意回去和那些人“不愿意回去”。但是，甚至是这个官样文章的声明都不能掩饰“甄别”是在威胁恫吓的气氛之下进行的。该声明说：在进行“甄别”以前的二十四小时中，侵朝美军当局即以我方被俘人员“自己的安全”为威胁，要挟我方被俘人员“在未举行个别谈话以前不要和别人谈这个问题（按指强迫扣留），也不要透露他们的决定”。而进行谈话时，每一个我方被俘人员都“被分别叫去进行秘密谈话”；进行询问的则是美国侵略者的所谓“极其胜任的人员”。在这种恫吓情况下进行的“调查”和“甄别”，个人的意志显然不可能有自由表示的机会，更谈不到尊重他们的意志了。尽管如此，由于我方被俘人员的坚决不屈和要求遣返祖国的意志，美国侵略者无耻的“甄别”工作显然没有能够收到预期的效果。四月二十一日的美国“新闻周刊”透露，“彻底审查联军战俘营后显示，‘拒绝遣返’的共方俘虏人数，比原先估计的少得多。”实际上，美方的所谓“个别询问”、“甄别”只不过是故弄玄虚，为其强行扣留我方被俘人员制造藉口。美国侵略者是按照其预定的阴谋，把它准备强迫扣留的我方被俘人员的名字从名单上删去的。“新闻周刊”供认：共军俘虏正式名单也在逐渐削减中，华盛顿希望它能够进一步减少。美方这次提出的仅包括七万人的我方被俘人员的自愿遣返名单，显然就是这样假造出来的。
    在所谓“甄别”工作之后，美国侵略者正在改变我方被俘人员的拘留地点，将我方被俘人员分散和隔离，以便强行扣留他们。目前，这一阴险的“分散措施”正在大规模地进行。据美联社四月二十四日电透露，“在过去五天中，至少有一万五千人被运离巨济岛，以后也许还会有人被运走。”“联合国军宣布的六个新俘虏营，大概可以容纳六万俘虏。”在此以前，美联社汉城四月十六日电已经承认：“联军开始这一新的行动（按指‘分散措施’）可能是着眼于板门店停战谈判。”显然地，这种“分散措施”的目的是为了更便于美方以恫吓、虐待和屠杀的方法来强迫扣留我方被俘人员的。
    美国侵略者如此顽固地坚持“自愿遣返”的要求，其阴谋现已完全暴露。美国侵略者这一荒唐要求，同时还表明美国侵略者也把美国及其仆从国家的被俘人员和他们的亲友的利益置于脑后。在人民的压力下，英国、加拿大、法国等曾向美国暗地指出，“拒绝遣返‘所有’战俘可能是破坏日内瓦公约”（四月十日“华盛顿每日新闻”）。英国并且担忧地向美国问道：为了扣留朝中方面的被俘人员，“我们（美英方面）是否要牺牲已被俘掳的我方人员”（四月三日英国“外事报道”）。对此，“美国国务院迄今在抵抗此种压力”（四月十日“华盛顿每日新闻”）。美国侵略者不仅蓄意“牺牲”曾供其当炮灰使用的仆从国家的被俘士兵，并且也已蓄谋对付那些不满侵略战争政策的美国被俘士兵。据美联社汶山二十五日电透露，即使有人对于为了强行扣留朝中方面被俘人员“而牺牲一些美军士兵这一点感到焦虑”，“联军的态度仍无软化的迹象”。在此以前，美方代表李比在一月二十一日就曾说过：根据“自愿遣返”的原则，“只有完全忠心的人员才会遣回”。电通社驻华盛顿记者在同日揭露，美国政府已为那些通不过“忠诚试验”的美国被俘士兵，准备好了集中营。
    人们同时也从这一个月来的第四项议程参谋会议中看到：我方代表是在加紧为实现释放并遣返双方全部被俘人员的合理原则而努力。我方为了使谈判迅速达成协议，不仅提出了合情合理的关于遣俘的折衷调整原则，并且把我方新增的战俘也列入战俘名单，将总数增加为一万二千人，超过了去年十二月十八日提交的名单所列的一万一千五百五十九人之数。我方这种仁至义尽的态度，原为第四项议程之达成协议，提供了有利的条件。但是，由于美方的破坏，谈判又陷入僵局。如果美国侵略者继续坚持其“自愿遣返”而实质上是大批强迫扣留我方被俘人员的无理要求，那么，它就绝对逃避不了它所应负的拖延和破坏停战谈判的严重罪责。
