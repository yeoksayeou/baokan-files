    On the Transportation Line to Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Shenying
    On the transportation line from the Lhasa River to the Jinsha River, which stretches for more than 2,500 li, there are thousands of transportation teams organized by Tibetan people, advancing to Lhasa in an endless stream every day.

    From Shuo Ban Duo to Luolongzong, in the flat and open river valley, Tibetan men and women drive hundreds of yaks, whistling and singing loud mountain songs, advancing happily. When I asked them what they were carrying, they all gave a thumbs-up and said: "JinZhu MaMi (People's Liberation Army)'s rice, Mengbu (very, very) much of it." On the Wahe Mountain, which spans 120 li and rises 5,300 meters above sea level, clouds and fog are thick, and snowflakes are flying, groups of yaks seem to be floating towards us in the white ocean. Snow fell on the Tibetans, turning everyone into a snowman, but they still greeted me with smiles: "Countryman! Yamu (very good)!" Along the foothills and on the grasslands, I saw many Tibetans resting on the ground after a journey, eating Zanba. Herds of yaks were grazing, and the loads were piled neatly beside the road, like a short wall.

    The personnel at the supply stations along the way told me that the Tibetan transportation teams never allowed materials to be stockpiled, and always transported them as soon as they arrived. The Tibetans have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in supporting the transport of materials for the People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet. The Tibetans of Jiali and Bianba traveled from afar with four or five hundred yaks to wait for the transportation of materials. The headmen and Tibetans of Luolongzong and Bianba often ran to the supply stations to see if there were any materials that needed to be transported. They assured the supply station personnel: "Please rest assured! There will be no stockpiling of materials. If there are not enough animals, we will carry them ourselves."

    During the transportation, the Tibetans had many vivid examples of cherishing the materials. A Tibetan named Lundui in the Reya area transported materials more than thirty times with more than sixty yaks, and never once damaged or lost any materials. Every time he accepted a transportation task, he always carefully checked the sacks, and if they were torn, he would mend them himself. From Reya to Changdu, it was necessary to cross the Damala Mountain, which is more than 4,900 meters above sea level. At night, when camping on the barren mountaintop, he and his companions slept around the materials to protect them. On rainy days, they would put a layer of stones under the materials and cover them with Pulu to prevent the materials from getting damp. His exemplary behavior of cherishing materials was rewarded by a supply station of the People's Liberation Army at the mass meeting on New Year's Day this year, and he was presented with a banner with the words "Model Transporter." In Jiangda Zong, a Tibetan named Dan Ci was transporting goods to Jiaoyong when one of his yaks fell off a cliff and drowned in the rapid river. At that time, he ignored his own cattle and immediately jumped into the water to retrieve the materials, carrying them on his back to the destination. His exemplary deeds were not only praised by the People's Liberation Army, but also widely circulated among the Tibetans.

    During the transportation, the Tibetans established a deep friendship with the supply station personnel of the People's Liberation Army. They always talked and laughed when they went to the supply stations. The courtyard of a certain supply station was often crowded with Tibetans, like a lively gathering. The Tibetan Lundui would always sit down at a certain supply station and talk to the soldiers in the supply station every time he passed by a certain supply station during transportation.

    The Tibetan people will always cherish and actively support the People's Liberation Army. They said, "The People's Liberation Army is here to work for us, and not only do they not ask us for anything, but they also give us foot money for transporting materials. How can we not be grateful to the People's Liberation Army!"

    到拉萨的运输线上
    新华社记者　赵慎应
    从拉萨河到金沙江边长达二千五百多里的运输线上，每天都有千百个藏族人民组织的运输队，络绎不绝地向拉萨前进。
    从硕般多到洛隆宗，在平坦开阔的河谷里，男女藏民赶着数以百计的牦牛群，吹着口哨，唱着嘹亮的山歌，愉快地前进着。当我问他们驮的什么时，他们都伸着大拇指说：“金珠马米（解放军）的大米，孟布（很多很多）的有了。”在横亘一百二十里拔海五千三百公尺的瓦合山上，云雾弥漫，雪花纷飞，一群群的牦牛像在白茫茫的海洋中迎面浮游过来。雪落在藏民们身上，使每个人都变成了雪人，但他们仍满面笑容和我招呼着：“老乡！牙姆（很好）！”沿途的山脚下，草地上，我看见许多藏民赶了一程路后坐在地上休息，吃着?粑。成群的牦牛在吃草，驮子堆在路旁，整整齐齐地像一堵短墙。
    沿途兵站的人员告诉我，藏民的运输队从来没有使物资积压下来，总是随到随运。藏民们在支援人民解放军进藏部队的运输中，发挥了高度的积极性。嘉黎和边坝的藏民，曾从很远的地方赶来四五百头牦牛，等待运输物资。洛隆宗和边坝的头人和藏民，经常跑到兵站去看有没有物资需要运输，他们向兵站人员保证说：“请放心吧！绝不积压物资，牲口不够，我们自己背。”
    在运输中，藏民们有很多爱护物资的生动事例，热雅地区一个名叫伦堆的藏民，他带了六十多头牦牛运输了三十多次，没有一次损坏或少过物资。当他每次接受运输任务后，他总是仔细地将麻袋检查一遍，破了的就自己缝补好。从热雅到昌都要翻越拔海四千九百多公尺的达马拉山，夜间宿营在荒凉的山顶上，他便和伙伴们睡在物资周围，保护着物资。雨天，他们便在物资下面铺上一层石块，上面盖上氆氇，防止物资受潮湿。他这种爱护物资的模范行为，在今年元旦的群众大会上受到解放军某兵站的奖赏，并赠给他写着“模范运输员”字样的锦旗。在江达宗，一个叫聃次的藏民在往角雍的运输途中，他的一头牦牛从悬崖上跌到湍急的河里淹死了。他当时不顾自己的牛，立即钻进水里将物资捞起，自己背着送到目的地。他的模范事迹不但受到人民解放军的表扬，而且在藏民中广泛传诵着。
    藏民们在运输中和解放军的兵站人员建立了深厚的感情，他们到兵站里总是有说有笑。某兵站的院子里，常常挤满了藏民，如同热闹的会场。藏民伦堆在每次运输中路过某兵站时，就要到兵站坐一坐，找兵站里的解放军谈谈心。
    藏族人民永远爱护和积极支援着人民解放军。他们说：“解放军来给我们办事，不但不向我们要东西，我们运输一点物资还要给脚价，怎能不感激解放军呢！”
