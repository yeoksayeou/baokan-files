Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 6th: The seventy-four inspection teams participating in the first campaign of the Shanghai "Five-Anti" movement have generally completed their summaries and concluded victoriously at the end of the campaign. The content of the summary meetings generally included a comprehensive self-criticism by the capitalists who had confessed their illegal activities, promising never again to engage in activities harmful to the country and the people; workers announced the victorious achievements of the "Five-Anti" struggle and expressed their determination to improve production in the future; the inspection team commended and encouraged the workers' heroic struggle and exemplary actions, ordering the capitalists who had bowed their heads and admitted their guilt to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, honestly submit to the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and engage in operations beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. As a result, the workers further raised their awareness and were in high spirits. The workers of the Mei Lin Canned Food Factory said after the summary meeting: "After this 'Five-Anti' inspection, we have truly stood up." The investigated illegal capitalists, seeing the government's benevolent and just handling of them and the workers' well-intentioned criticism, were also very grateful and expressed their determination to correct their past mistakes and perform meritorious service under the leadership of the working class. The bosses of Yongye Iron Factory, Xinhua Electric Machinery Factory, and Mingchang Wood Factory all reported other illegal industrial and commercial households after the summary meeting. Chen Runsu, the capitalist of Mei Lin Canned Food Factory, and the boss of Jinlong Brown Rope Manufacturing Factory even requested to participate in the inspection work and mobilize other illegal capitalists to confess.

    Before disbanding, each inspection team helped the workers of each factory and store to reorganize their trade union organizations and establish basic-level "Five-Anti" committees to continue assisting the government in implementing the "Five-Anti" movement and improving production. After the new trade union basic-level committee of Zhongnan Rubber Factory was elected, it immediately convened a meeting to discuss future production work. The Huafu Industrial Raw Material Company had originally ceased production due to unscrupulous capitalists engaging in speculation. After this inspection, under the urging of the workers, they are actively preparing to resume work.

    上海“五反”第一战役各检查队开总结会
    表扬职工斗争成绩、责令悔过的资本家立功赎罪
    【新华社上海六日电】参加上海市“五反”运动第一战役的七十四个检查队，在战役结束时普遍做到了作好总结，胜利收兵。总结会的内容，一般是由已经坦白违法行为的资本家在会上作一个总的检讨，并保证以后再不作危害国家人民的事情；职工宣布“五反”斗争胜利的成果，并表示今后搞好生产的决心；检查队表扬和鼓励职工的英勇斗争和模范行动，责令已低头认罪的资本家立功赎罪，老老实实服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，从事有利国计民生的经营。因此，职工们进一步提高了觉悟，情绪很高。梅林罐头食品厂的工人在总结大会以后说：“经过这次‘五反’检查，我们才真正站了起来。”被检查的违法资本家，看到人民政府对他们仁至义尽的处理和职工对他们善意的批评，也非常感激，纷纷表示今后要痛改前非，在工人阶级领导下戴罪立功。永业铁工厂、新华电机业机器厂、明昌木厂的老板在总结会后都检举了其他违法工商户。梅林罐头食品厂的资方陈润岁、金龙棕绳制造厂的老板并要求参加检查工作，动员其他违法资本家坦白。
    各个检查队都在收兵以前帮助各厂、店的职工整理了工会组织，建立了基层“五反”委员会，继续协助人民政府贯彻“五反”运动，搞好生产。中南橡胶厂新的工会基层委员会选出后，立即召开会议，讨论今后的生产工作。华福工业原料行原来因为不法资方专搞投机买卖，生产原来已告停顿，经过这次检查后，在职工们的促使下，已积极准备开工。
