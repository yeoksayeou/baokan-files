Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Japan Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions on the 15th, expressing support for the sacred and just struggle of Japanese worker brothers against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill". The telegram is as follows: Japan Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions:

    Please convey our most sincere respects to the Japanese worker brothers who are fighting heroically against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." Japanese worker brothers:

    Workers all over the world and all other peace-loving people deeply feel the great significance of your current struggle. It is not only for Japan's national independence, democracy, freedom and improvement of people's lives, but also a major contribution to the world peace movement. Therefore, workers all over the world are concerned about your struggle and express brotherly sympathy and heartfelt respect to you!

    These fascist bills of the Yoshida government, which attempt to completely deprive the Japanese people of basic human rights such as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, demonstration, and strike, are only for the purpose of more frantically attacking all Japanese democratic parties, democratic groups, and all patriotic Japanese people who are unwilling to be cannon fodder for American imperialists and Japanese reactionaries, who oppose the new disaster of war, and who oppose turning Japan into an American imperialist military base. The protest struggle launched by the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the Japanese people out of extreme anger at this conspiracy of the American imperialist agent Yoshida government has swept the country and won the sympathy of the entire society; the firm fighting spirit and unity shown by the Japanese working class in this struggle are worthy of admiration by workers all over the world and serve as a good example. Workers all over the world warmly support the sacred and just struggle of the Japanese worker brothers.

    The Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on workers in Asia and Australia to give you strong support. We have lodged a serious protest with the Yoshida government.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 15th, strongly protesting against the Japanese government's anti-people measures to formulate the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" and supporting the struggle waged by Japanese workers for this purpose. The telegram is as follows: Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida:

    The Japanese government is attempting to formulate the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" to deprive Japanese workers and all progressive people of their basic rights - freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, demonstration, and strike - to suppress their just activities for improving their lives and defending peace and democracy, and to attempt to push the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the Japanese people into a deeper abyss of pain and poverty. This bill fundamentally violates the principles of Japanese democracy stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration, and its purpose is to completely stifle the Japanese people's desire to oppose militarization. This has aroused extreme anger among the Japanese people and the people of the world.

    On behalf of the workers of Asia and Australia, we strongly protest against this anti-people measure. We fully sympathize with and support the various struggles waged by Japanese workers against the formulation of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill".

    抗议吉田反动政府企图制定法西斯法案
    【新华社十五日讯】世界工会联合会亚澳联络局十五日致电世界工联日本联络事务局，声援日本工人兄弟为反对“防止破坏活动法案”而作的神圣正义斗争。电文如下：世界工会联合会日本联络事务局：
    请你们把我们的最热诚的敬意转告给为反对“防止破坏活动法案”而英勇斗争的日本工人兄弟们。日本工人兄弟们：
    全世界工人以及其他一切爱好和平的人民，深深感觉到你们当前所进行的斗争的伟大意义。它不仅是为了日本的民族独立、民主、自由和改善人民的生活，而且是对于保卫世界和平运动的重大贡献。因此，全世界工人都关心你们所进行的斗争，并向你们表示兄弟般的同情和衷心的敬意！
    吉田政府这些企图完全剥夺日本人民言论、出版、集会、结社、示威游行、罢工等基本人权的法西斯化法案，只是为了更加疯狂地向一切不愿充当美帝国主义者和日本反动派的炮灰、反对战争的新灾难、反对变日本为美帝国主义军事基地的一切日本民主政党、民主团体以及所有爱国的日本人民实行更恶毒的进攻。日本工人阶级和日本广大人民由于对美帝国主义代理人吉田政府这一阴谋的极度愤怒而掀起的抗议斗争，已席卷全国而获得整个社会的同情；日本工人阶级在这一斗争中所表现的坚强斗志和团结一致，是值得全世界工人钦佩的，并作了一个很好的榜样。全世界工人热烈拥护和支持日本工人兄弟的神圣正义斗争。
    世界工联亚澳联络局号召亚、澳两洲的工人给予你们以有力的声援、我们已向吉田政府提出了严重抗议。

    【新华社十五日讯】世界工会联合会亚澳联络局十五日致电日本政府首相吉田茂，严重抗议日本政府企图制定所谓“防止破坏活动法案”的反人民措施，并支持日本工人为此所进行的斗争。电文如下：吉田茂首相：
    日本政府正企图制定所谓“防止破坏活动法案”，来剥夺日本工人和一切进步人民的基本权利——言论、出版、集会、结社、示威游行、罢工的自由，镇压他们为改善生活和保卫和平、民主所进行的正义活动，且企图把日本工人阶级和日本广大人民推向更加痛苦和贫困的深渊。这一法案根本违反了波茨坦宣言所规定的日本民主的原则，其目的是在于完全窒息日本人民反对军国主义化的热望。这就引起了日本人民和全世界人民的极度愤怒。
    我们代表亚洲、澳洲的工人，严重抗议这种反人民的措施。我们完全同情并支持日本工人反对制定“防止破坏活动法案”所进行的各种斗争。
