Wishing Success to the International Conference for the Defence of Children
Li Siguang
Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children

    The International Conference for the Defence of Children, initiated by the International Democratic Women's Federation, which has member groups from sixty-two countries and one hundred and thirty-five million members, and by many internationally renowned figures concerned with peace and children, has opened in Vienna. This is a historic and important conference for defending world peace.

    Currently, there exist two completely opposing principles and policies regarding children in the world. On the one hand, there are the imperialist countries, led by U.S. imperialism, which suppress and destroy the physical and mental development of children. On the other hand, there are the democratic countries, represented by the Soviet Union, including our People's Republic of China. These countries demand that all the children of the world have happy lives, normal development, and good education.

    U.S. imperialists provoke national hatred, advocate overpopulation theories, and promote so-called "eugenics" and pseudo-"child science" of aptitude measurement. Their aim is to destroy and deprive children of the right to education. They launch wars, and they kill peace-loving women and children. Recently, they have even resorted to the heinous use of bacteriological bombs to massacre tens of thousands of innocent lives.

    The policy of the peaceful and democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, is exactly the opposite. We love peace and cherish children. In the Soviet Union, children and their education are valued; great efforts are made to cultivate the younger generation, and great hopes are placed on them. In New China, children are also cared for by the People's Government. Before liberation, the number of infants under one year old who died each year accounted for about one-fifth of the number of births. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, maternity stations and other maternal and child health institutions have greatly developed, now numbering more than 10,000, and 110,000 old-style midwives have been transformed, which has reduced the infant mortality rate. In recent years, more than 100 million children have been vaccinated free of charge, and one million children have been vaccinated with BCG and other vaccinations against infectious diseases, which has reduced the incidence of childhood diseases. The number of nurseries has increased more than twelve times compared with before liberation, and the number of seasonal nurseries has increased 106 times compared with the year before last. This has not only improved the status of women and the efficiency of women's labor production, but also improved the educational level of pre-school children. As for the education of school-age children, it has also greatly developed. After the reform of the school system, a large number of children of working people have been enrolled in schools, and the number of students currently enrolled exceeds the highest level during the twenty years of Kuomintang rule (1946) by 56 percent. After the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law in 1950, the dignity and status of women, mothers, and children were further affirmed, and their rights were guaranteed.

    The reason why the children's welfare cause in New China has achieved such results is because China was liberated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. For more than two years, construction in various fields has progressed rapidly and achieved great achievements. This is why imperialism is afraid of us. In order to make a desperate struggle, the U.S. aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea. When it was disastrously defeated by the armed forces of the Chinese and Korean people, it heinously launched bacteriological warfare, attempting to massacre the Chinese and Korean people who are fighting for justice and peace, and the precious next generation of the Chinese and Korean people.

    World peace and human dignity are inviolable. For the sake of lasting world peace and the happiness of the next generation, we must use all our strength to crush the inhuman bacteriological warfare and repel the U.S. imperialist aggression against us. The people of the world who love peace and care about the future generations of mankind are on our side, so victory must belong to us.

    The International Conference for the Defence of Children, which is being held in Vienna, is an important part of defending world peace and eliminating the threat of imperialist war. We respectfully wish the conference success! The People's Volunteers in the front line in Korea and the working people of the whole country are working hard for the happiness of children throughout the country and the world. The world of tomorrow will be happier and brighter.

    祝国际保卫儿童大会成功
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会副主席
    李四光
    由拥有六十二个国家会员团体，一亿三千五百万会员的国际民主妇联和许多关心和平、关心儿童的国际知名人士所发起召开的国际保卫儿童大会，在维也纳开幕了。这是一个富有历史性的、保卫世界的持久和平的重要会议。
    目前世界上，存在着两种完全相反的对待儿童的原则和政策。一方面是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家，它们抑制并摧残儿童身心的发展；另一方面是以苏联为代表的民主国家、包括我们中华人民共和国在内，我们这些国家要求全世界的儿童有幸福的生活，儿童们有正常的发展和良好的教育。
    美帝国主义者挑拨民族仇恨，提倡人口过剩论，提倡所谓“优生学”以及天资测量的伪“儿童科学”。他们的目的是摧残和剥夺儿童的教育权。他们发动战争，他们杀戮爱好和平的妇女和儿童。最近他们且穷凶极恶地用细菌弹来残杀千千万万无辜的生命。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营对于儿童的政策恰恰和这相反。我们爱好和平、爱护儿童。在苏联，儿童和儿童教育受到了重视；对青年后代用大力培育，对他们寄托着重大的希望。在新中国，儿童也受到了人民政府的关怀，解放前每年一岁以下的婴儿的死亡数约占出生数的五分之一。中央人民政府成立以后，接生站等妇幼保健机构有了大的发展，现已达一万多个，被改造的旧式产婆已有十一万人，这就减低了新生儿的死亡率。年来有一亿多的儿童得到免费种痘，一百万儿童接种了卡介苗及其他传染病的预防接种，这样就减低了儿童的疾病率。托儿所比解放前增加了十二倍以上，农忙托儿所比前年增加了一百零六倍，这不但提高了妇女的地位和妇女的劳动生产的效率，而且也提高了学龄前儿童的教育水准。至于学龄儿童教育也有了很大的发展。学制改革后大量劳动人民的儿童入学了，现在他们入学的数目已超过国民党统治二十年中最高水平（一九四六年）的百分之五十六。一九五○年婚姻法颁布实行以后，更肯定了妇女、母亲和儿童的尊严地位，保障了她们的权利。
    新中国儿童福利事业所以取得这样的成果，是因为中国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下解放了，推翻了帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本主义的统治。两年多以来，各方面的建设突飞猛进，获得巨大的成就。这便是帝国主义害怕我们的原因。为了作垂死的挣扎，美国侵略者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。当它被中朝人民的武装力量打得惨败的时候，就穷凶极恶地发动细菌战，企图残杀为正义、为和平而斗争的中朝人民和中朝人民的宝贵的下一代。
    世界和平和人类的尊严是不可侮的，我们为了全世界的持久和平，为了下一代的幸福，我们要用一切力量来粉碎惨无人道的细菌战，来打退美帝国主义对我们的进攻。全世界爱好和平，关心人类后代的人民，都是站在我们这一边的，因此胜利一定是属于我们的。
    正在维也纳召开的国际保卫儿童大会，是保卫世界和平、清除帝国主义战争威胁的一个重要部分。我们敬祝大会成功！我们在朝鲜前线的人民志愿军，全国的劳动人民都在为全国和全世界儿童的幸福而努力。明天的世界是更幸福更光明的。
