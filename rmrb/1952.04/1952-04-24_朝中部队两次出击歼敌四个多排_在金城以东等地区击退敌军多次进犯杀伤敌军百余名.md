Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 23rd: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in the six days from April 15th to 20th, repelled nearly ten enemy invasions in areas east of Kimhwa and near Mundung-ri, inflicting over a hundred casualties on the enemy. Simultaneously, the Korean-Chinese People's forces, in two attacks, eliminated more than four platoons of enemy troops. On the night of the 15th, our troops, with the support of powerful artillery fire, launched a counterattack on two hills northwest of Jangdan, largely annihilating two platoons of the defending enemy, the 5th Regiment of the US Marine Corps 1st Division, killing and wounding over seventy enemy soldiers. Another group of our brave soldiers stormed the US military positions on Dongshan, north of Shasari, north of Jangdan, eliminating most of an enemy platoon, killing and wounding over thirty enemy soldiers. On the night of the 17th, a crack night raid team of our troops suddenly charged into an enemy position on an unnamed hill southeast of Kimhwa, and in just twenty minutes, completely annihilated a platoon of the defending Rhee's puppet army, killing and wounding thirty-nine enemy soldiers.
