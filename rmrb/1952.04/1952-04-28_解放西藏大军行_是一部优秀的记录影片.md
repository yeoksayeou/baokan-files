    “The March of the People's Liberation Army into Tibet” is an Excellent Documentary Film
    Comrade Editor: Recently, Zhangjiakou screened the Beijing Film Studio's documentary "The March of the People's Liberation Army into Tibet." After watching this film, the audience was extremely excited and grateful to the comrades who filmed with the army for making such an excellent film. Many people felt that watching this film was a rich lesson in patriotism. It faithfully and promptly introduced the great scene of the People's Liberation Army overcoming many difficulties to liberate the border areas of the motherland to the broad masses of the audience. When people saw our young air force flying over high mountains that no one had ever flown over before, transporting grain to support the troops entering Tibet, it aroused even greater love for the great motherland. This film teaches us to learn from the People's Liberation Army's high spirit of patriotism and selfless spirit of not fearing any hardships, and to implement this spirit into our practical work.
    I hope that literary and art workers will reflect more of the fresh things and economic construction of the great motherland to the broad masses of people as soon as possible, in order to encourage and guide the broad masses of people to advance victoriously!

    “解放西藏大军行”是一部优秀的记录影片
    编辑同志：最近张家口放映了北影出品的记录片“解放西藏大军行”。观众们看完这个影片后，无不兴奋万分，感谢那些随军摄影的同志们拍了一部优秀的影片。很多人看了这部影片，觉得是上了丰富的爱国主义的一课。因为它把解放军克服许多困难解放祖国边疆的伟大情景，忠实而又及时地介绍给了广大的观众。当人们看到我国年轻的空军飞过从未有人飞过的高山，输送粮食支援入藏的部队时，更激起了对伟大祖国的热爱。这部影片教育我们要向人民解放军那种高度的爱国主义精神和不怕一切艰苦的自我牺牲精神学习，把这种精神贯彻到实际工作中去。
    我希望文学艺术工作者们更多地把伟大祖国的新鲜事物和经济建设等方面的情况，尽快地反映给广大人民，以鼓舞和指导广大人民胜利前进！
    鸣真
