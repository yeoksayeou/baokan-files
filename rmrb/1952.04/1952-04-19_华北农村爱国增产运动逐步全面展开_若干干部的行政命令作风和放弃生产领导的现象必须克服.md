The vast number of peasants in North China are tensely engaged in spring plowing and sowing. Various provinces have begun sowing autumn crops and cotton; the colder Yanbei area of ​​Chahar is carrying out crash sowing of soybeans and spring wheat. Because various localities have carried out in-depth ideological mobilization in drought prevention and preparation work, the enthusiasm of farmers throughout the region for patriotic production increase is very high.

The soil moisture preservation and preparation movement launched in North China in early February has prepared extremely favorable conditions for the region to increase yield per unit area. The scale of the mass soil moisture preservation movement is unprecedented in previous years. In Chahar province, 467,000 mu of frozen and wet land was thawed in twenty-eight days. In the Changzhi area of ​​Shanxi, snow accumulation in sixteen counties can preserve moisture for 100,000 mu. After the snowfall in mid-February in the Shijiazhuang area of ​​Hebei, more than 800 cadres went to the countryside and organized more than 30,000 farmers and 10,000 carts to transport snow, with up to 300 carts of snow per mu. The scale of land rolling, harrowing, and raking in various provinces has also exceeded any previous year. In Guisui County, Suiyuan, the habit of raking land is not widespread, but this year 130,000 mu out of more than 190,000 mu of cultivated land has been raked. In Hebei province, all autumn fields except for mountainous and wet areas have been harrowed once, and some have been harrowed three to eight times. In addition, farmers throughout the region have made considerable achievements in building small-scale water conservancy projects themselves. In Shanxi province, due to digging canals and wells in March alone, the irrigated area was expanded by 440,000 mu; well digging in other provinces has far exceeded the plan. Although there has only been a small rain of one or two fingers recently, the soil has been moistened, which is most suitable for sowing.

Increasing fertilizer application is one of the important keys to increasing yield per unit area. People's governments at all levels, state-owned economic departments, and cooperatives have organized forces to actively support farmers in increasing fertilizer. Of the 580 million jin of fine fertilizer planned for supply in North China, 70% has been issued. The Jie County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi did a good job of ordering and pre-selling in advance; as soon as the fertilizer arrived at the railway station, it immediately notified the villages to collect it; therefore, four cadres distributed 320,000 jin of fine fertilizer such as soybean cake to farmers in fifteen hours on March 12. Fertilizer supply is mainly distributed in cotton-producing areas, mountainous areas, and disaster areas. The amount of fertilizer applied in these areas is generally 20% to 100% more than last year. The supply figures for waterwheels, farm tools, and pesticides are very large. Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan have loaned out more than 40,000 waterwheels. Chahar has shipped 10,000 seven-inch walking plows to various counties. Suiyuan recently sold a total of more than 57,000 pieces of farm tools such as shovels and seeders. Pingyuan issued 10,400 sprayers and 1,903,000 jin of pesticides. The seed supply problem has been largely resolved in all provinces except for the disaster areas of Suiyuan and Pingyuan. In Hebei alone, 2.17 million jin of improved cotton seeds have been promoted in eight areas including Shijiazhuang.

The promotion and adoption of advanced farming experience has been valued by various localities. Hebei Province has established a science and technology promotion network on the basis of training 200,000 labor models and technical experts last year. Before spring plowing, each county held training courses and universally trained the members of the technical groups in each village. Anping, Mancheng and other counties plan to achieve "every village has a group, the whole county builds a network." The mutual aid groups in the village where cotton production model Qu Yaoli is located have technical instructors who teach cotton planting experience by Qu Yaoli. He has given cotton planting reports to more than 5,000 farmers in the vicinity.

In the course of these works, all provinces have implemented the general policy of organizing to develop agricultural production; mutual aid groups have had new development, and some have been consolidated and improved. This year, when developing mutual aid groups, various localities have overcome the conservative practices of "typical experiments, key promotions" that were hampered in previous years, and adopted methods such as convening mutual aid group representative meetings and training rural activists. At the meeting, the mutual aid policy was explained, mutual aid experiences were exchanged, leadership difficulties were resolved, and a large number of mutual aid backbones were cultivated to meet the active demands of farmers, so that the mutual aid groups could be rapidly developed.

The People's Governments of all provinces have paid attention to the leadership of this year's spring plowing. Spring plowing and drought prevention agencies have been established at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, and special personnel have been designated to be responsible. From mid-February to March, various localities successively convened people's representative conferences at all levels, as well as conferences of labor models, mutual aid group representatives, and propagandist representatives. In Shanxi, more than 100,000 village cadres and labor models participated in the meeting. More than 300 counties in the region have held people's representative conferences centered on discussing spring plowing production. At these meetings, drought prevention and production increase plans were specifically formulated or revised. After discussion at the representative meeting in each county of Pingyuan Province, there has been a great change in water conservancy alone: the province originally planned to open six large canals, and four new ones have been added; the original plan to dig 30,000 water wells has been increased by 5,000.

In addition to various conference mobilizations, various localities have also organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to provide specific guidance. Governments at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in the region have successively dispatched more than 40,000 cadres to work in the countryside. Hebei Province implements a method of combining continuous inspection, level-by-level inspection, and on-site inspection, and solves problems at any time when they are discovered, which is very effective. At the beginning of spring plowing, Yang Xiufeng, chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, led an inspection team to go deep into the countryside to inspect spring plowing and sowing. Yang Gengtian, chairman of the Chahar Provincial People's Government, went to Yanggao County to preside over a production meeting and create leadership experience to specifically guide this year's large-scale production movement. Therefore, the farmers' production enthusiasm has been greatly encouraged, and the patriotic production increase movement will be carried out in a more organized and led manner throughout the region.

At present, in the patriotic production increase movement, there are still the following main problems that must be vigorously solved:

First, there is a strong potential capacity in agricultural production that remains to be developed. According to a survey of 40 villages in the Xinxian area of ​​Shanxi: in areas with good production conditions, production can be increased by more than 50% on the existing level; in areas with poor production conditions, it can also be increased by 30%. However, because leading cadres in various localities, especially leading cadres at the county level and below, cannot truly implement the policy of relying on the masses, do not investigate, and do not discuss with the masses, they cannot see these favorable conditions. Therefore, to achieve this year's production increase task, we must first correct the administrative commandism style of cadres. Secondly, the conservative thinking of farmers and the utopian agricultural socialist thinking are also very harmful. The conditions for developing water conservancy are quite good in many areas; however, farmers believe that "watering will not grow crops" and are unwilling to use water. The habit of spreading manure all over the ground is also very common, and a lot of fertilizer is wasted. Some farmers believe: "The future of socialism will come even if you don't fight for it." To correct these wrong ideas of farmers, we must also fight against the remaining spontaneous ideas in the cadres. Because they often separate the task of carrying out political struggle and strengthening ideological leadership from the task of economic construction, they do not understand the importance of leadership. Without solving these problems from the leadership aspect, the realization of the production increase task is not guaranteed.

Second, it is necessary to ensure that the sown area of ​​grain and cotton meets the national production plan, and no longer blindly expand the cotton fields. After publicizing to the farmers that "planting more cotton last year was a patriotic manifestation, and planting more grain this year is also a patriotic manifestation," Hebei Province persuaded the majority of farmers to plant cotton fields in accordance with the national plan. However, some counties are still blindly expanding cotton fields. For example, in four typical villages in Wan County, the area farmers plan to plant cotton exceeds the number of mu arranged by more than one time. If we do not carry out persuasive education, it will inevitably affect grain production.

Third, it is necessary to continue to overcome the paralyzing and slack emotions of farmers and some cadres in drought prevention work. Although sowing has begun, the threat of drought has not passed. We should use the experience that "drought is afraid of the end but not the beginning" to educate farmers to establish the idea of ​​long-term drought prevention and resistance, and strive for a bumper harvest of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods.

Fourth, the disaster relief and production work in the vast majority of disaster areas has achieved great results, but some county cadres still have serious bureaucratic styles, resulting in new developments in the disaster situation. It is necessary to change the living conditions of farmers there in a short period of time, first of all to ensure that the victims sow in time, and continue to do a good job in sideline production and handicraft production. As long as we overcome the purely relief viewpoint and take a long-term perspective, organize ourselves, the difficulties can be completely resolved.

    华北农村爱国增产运动逐步全面展开
    若干干部的行政命令作风和放弃生产领导的现象必须克服
    华北广大农民正紧张地进行春耕播种。各省已开始播种大秋作物和棉花；较冷的察哈尔雁北地区在突击播种大豆、春麦。由于各地在防旱备耕工作中做了深入的思想动员，所以全区农民爱国增产的劲头很大。
    华北在二月初开展的保墒备耕运动，为全区提高单位面积产量准备了极有利的条件。群众性的保墒运动，规模之大为历年所未有。察哈尔全省在二十八天内背冰湿地四十六万七千亩。山西长治专区十六个县积雪可养墒十万亩。河北石家庄专区在二月中旬落雪后，有八百多干部下乡，组织了三万多农民和一万辆大车运雪，每亩地积雪有多至三百车的。各省压地、耙地、耢地的规模也超过以往任何一年。绥远归绥县三区耢地习惯并不普遍，十九万多亩耕地今年也耢过十三万亩。河北全省除去山区及湿洼地区外，秋田都已普耙一遍，有的耙了三遍至八遍的。此外，全区农民自己兴修小型水利也有不小成绩。山西省三月份一个月，由于开渠凿井，即扩大浇地四十四万亩；其他各省打井都远远超过计划。虽然最近只有一二指小雨，也都已接墒，最宜下种。
    增施肥料是提高单位面积产量的重要关键之一。各级人民政府、国营经济部门和合作社，曾组织力量积极支援农民增加肥料。华北全区计划供应的五亿八千万斤细肥，已发出百分之七十。山西解县供销社事先做好了定购预售工作；肥料运到火车站，就立即通知各村领取；因此，四个干部在三月十二日的十五个小时内，发给农民三十二万斤豆饼等细肥。肥料供应主要发在棉产区、山区以及灾区。这些地区的施肥量，一般都比去年增加二成到一倍。水车、农具和药械的供应数字很大。山西、河北、平原已贷出水车四万多辆。察哈尔已有一万部七吋步犁分运各县。绥远最近售出锹、耧等农具共五万七千多件。平原发出喷雾器一万零四百个，农药一百九十万三千斤。种籽供应问题，除绥远、平原两省灾区尚感不足外，其它各省已大体解决。仅河北在石家庄等八个专区推广的优种棉籽就有二百一十七万斤。
    先进耕作经验的推广和采用，已为各地所重视。河北省在去年训练过二十万劳动模范和技术能手的基础上，建立了科学技术推广网。春耕前，各县都召开了训练班，普遍训练了各村技术组组员。安平、满城等县计划做到“村村有组，全县建网”。棉花丰产模范曲耀离所在的村子的各个互助组，设有技术传授员，由曲耀离传授植棉经验。他曾向附近五千多农民做过植棉报告。
    在这些工作的进行中，各省都贯彻了组织起来发展农业生产的总方针；互助组都有新的发展，一部分得到巩固和提高。今年各地发展互助组时，克服了往年束手束脚的“典型试验，重点推广”的保守做法，采用了召开互助组代表会议、训练农村积极分子等办法。在会议上讲解互助政策，交流互助经验，解决领导困难，培养大批互助骨干来满足农民的积极要求，这样就使互助组得以迅速发展。
    各省人民政府对今年的春耕领导都很注意。省、专区、县各级都成立了春耕防旱机构，确定了专人负责。二月中旬到三月间，各地先后召开了各界人民代表会议以及劳动模范、互助组代表、宣传员代表等会议。山西参加过会议的村干部和劳动模范在十万人以上。全区有三百多县举行过以讨论春耕生产为中心的各界人民代表会议。在这些会议上，都具体拟订或增订了防旱增产计划。平原省各县经过代表会议讨论，单水利一项就有很大改变：全省原计划开六道大渠，又新增了四道；原计划打三万眼水井，又增加了五千眼。
    除各种会议动员之外，各地并组织大批干部下乡具体领导。全区省、专区、县各级政府先后共抽调了四万多干部下乡工作。河北省实行连续检查、层层检查、坐镇检查相结合的方法，发现问题随时解决，很有效果。在春耕开始时，河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰率检查组，深入农村检查春耕播种工作。察哈尔省人民政府主席杨耕田到阳高县主持生产会议，创造领导经验，以具体指导今年的大生产运动。因此，农民生产情绪受到很大的鼓舞，爱国增产运动将更加有组织有领导地在全区范围内开展。
    当前在爱国增产运动中，还有以下几个主要问题，须大力加以解决：
    第一、在农业生产上有着雄厚的潜在能力尚待发挥。据山西忻县专区四十个村的调查：在生产条件好的地区，可以在现有的水平上增产百分之五十以上；生产条件差的地区也可以增产百分之三十。可是，由于各地领导干部，特别是县以下各级领导干部，不能真正贯彻依靠群众的方针，不调查，不和群众讨论，只是片面地布置任务，因而也就看不到这些有利条件。因此，要实现今年的增产任务，就必须首先纠正干部中的行政命令作风。其次，农民的保守思想和空想的农业社会主义思想也是十分有害的。好多地区发展水利的条件相当好；但农民认为“水浇了就不长庄稼”，有水而不肯利用。漫地撒粪的习惯也很普遍，肥料浪费不少。有的农民认为：“社会主义前途，不争也会来。”要纠正农民的这些错误思想，还必须和干部中的自发论思想残余作斗争。因为他们常常把进行政治斗争、加强思想领导的任务，和经济建设的任务分割开来，所以不懂得领导的重要。不从领导方面解决这些问题，增产任务的实现是没有保证的。
    第二、要保证粮棉播种面积符合国家生产计划，不再盲目扩大棉田。河北省经过向农民宣传“去年多种棉是爱国表现，今年多种粮食也是爱国表现”，说服了广大农民按照国家计划播种棉田。但也有的县仍在盲目扩大棉田。如完县四个典型村，农民计划种棉面积超过布置亩数的一倍以上。如不进行说服教育，势必影响粮食生产。
    第三、要继续克服农民和一部分干部在防旱工作上的麻痹松懈情绪。下种虽已开始，但干旱威胁并未过去。应以“天旱怕尾不怕头”的经验，教育农民树立长期防旱抗旱的思想，争取粮食、工业原料及外销物资的丰收。
    第四、绝大部分灾区的救灾生产工作有很大成绩，但一些县份的干部还有严重的官僚主义作风，致灾情有新的发展。必须在短期内改变那里的农民生活状况，首先要保证灾民适时下种，并继续做好副业生产和手工业生产。只要克服了单纯的救济观点，从长期着眼，组织起来，困难是完全可以解决的。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（华宣）
