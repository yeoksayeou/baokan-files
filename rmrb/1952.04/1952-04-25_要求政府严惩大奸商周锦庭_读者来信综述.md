    Demand the Government to Severely Punish the Big Traitorous Merchant Zhou Jinting
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    After this newspaper exposed the heinous crimes of "Asbestos King" Zhou Jinting on April 12th, many readers wrote to this newspaper expressing great anger and demanding that the People's Government severely punish this traitorous merchant.
    Reader Li Daokui wrote in his letter: "Zhou Jinting - this living specimen of an illegal capitalist, centrally reflects the despicable and decadent nature of the bourgeoisie. He 'negotiated with the mine' to restrict the mine's output. Isn't this a monopolistic act that undermines the national economy? He cuts corners and uses inferior materials, which can harm model workers; can cause aircraft accidents, and make it impossible for tank operators to fight the enemy. Hasn't this act of stealing state property already developed to the point of endangering the country and harming the people? He openly uses the banner of the Labor Bureau to oppress workers. Isn't this blatant usurpation of the leadership of the working class? In his mind, is there even a trace of the Common Program!" All the employees of the Second Warehouse of Tianjin Department Store wrote in their letter: "After liberation, the government took care of the lives and studies of workers in many ways; but the big traitorous merchant Zhou Jinting squeezed and bullied workers in many ways, still riding on the heads of workers, making workers live like beasts of burden. We cannot tolerate the extremely reactionary behavior of this traitorous merchant." Reader Zhong Youlin and thirteen others wrote in their letter: "Zhou Jinting, such a big traitorous merchant who is stinking from head to toe, should be severely punished." Xie Yuguang, a cadre of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, wrote in his letter: "After reading about the heinous crimes of the big traitorous merchant Zhou Jinting, we have a clearer understanding of how rampant illegal bourgeois elements are in attacking the working class." All the employees of the Institute of Arts of Peking University wrote in their letter: "The big traitorous merchant Zhou Jinting is not only 'infected with all five poisons,' he is simply an accomplice of American imperialism." In these letters, readers unanimously demanded that the government quickly and severely punish the big traitorous merchant Zhou Jinting and confiscate all his property.

    要求政府严惩大奸商周锦庭
    ——读者来信综述
    本报四月十二日揭发“石棉王座”周锦庭的万恶罪行后，许多读者给本报来信，表示极大愤怒，并要求人民政府严惩这个奸商。
    读者黎稻葵来信说：“周锦庭——这个违法资本家的活标本，集中地反映了资产阶级的卑劣腐朽的本性。他‘与矿山接洽’限制矿山的产量。这不是破坏国家经济的垄断行为吗？他偷工减料，可以暗害劳动模范；可以使飞机发生事故，使坦克手无法对敌作战。这种盗窃国家资财的行为，不是已经发展到祸国殃民的地步了吗？他公开打着劳动局的旗号来压迫工人。这不是明目张胆地在篡夺工人阶级的领导权吗？他的心目中，那里还有一丝一毫共同纲领的影子！”天津市百货公司第二仓库全体职工来信说：“解放后，政府多方面地照顾工人的生活和学习；而大奸商周锦庭却多方面地压榨、欺侮工人，仍骑在工人头上，使工人过着像牛马的生活。我们不能容忍奸商这种极其反动的行为。”读者钟友林等十三人来信说：“周锦庭这样从头顶到脚底都是恶臭的大奸商，应当受到最严厉的惩罚。”北京市公安局干部谢裕光来信说：“当我们看了大奸商周锦庭的滔天罪行后，我们更清楚地认识到了不法资产阶级分子是在如何猖狂地向工人阶级进攻。”北京大学文科研究所全体职工来信说：“大奸商周锦庭不只是‘五毒俱全’，简直是美帝国主义的帮凶。”读者们在这些来信中，都一致要求政府迅速严惩大奸商周锦庭，并没收他的全部财产。
