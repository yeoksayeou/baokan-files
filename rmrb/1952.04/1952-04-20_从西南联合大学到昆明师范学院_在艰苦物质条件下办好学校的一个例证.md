From Southwest Associated University to Kunming Normal College
-- An Example of Running a School Well Under Difficult Material Conditions
Wu Yucai, Bai Sheng
(I)
Anyone who studied at Southwest Associated University (hereinafter referred to as Southwest United University) in Kunming will never forget those years of life in Kunming.
Southwest United University was formed by the merger of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University during the Anti-Japanese War. Before the relocation from Beijing and Tianjin, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University each had more than a thousand students; when they moved to Changsha, some students bravely participated in the Anti-Japanese War. The teachers and students in Changsha then formed the Changsha Temporary University. Finally, they moved from Changsha to Kunming, Yunnan (April 1938), and began to be called Southwest Associated University. At that time, the College of Engineering was in Kunming, and the College of Liberal Arts and Law was in Mengzi. In the summer of 1938, the College of Liberal Arts and Law also moved from Mengzi to Kunming.
The eight years of teaching and learning life of the faculty and students of Southwest United University were difficult, and the mobility was also very large. The classrooms and dormitories for the students alone were moved several times. The "New Campus," completed in 1939, was the center of Southwest United University and the location of the university's Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, and Law. This campus was located next to a dirt road outside the Great Western Gate of Kunming. When it was first built, there were no electric lights, and eight students shared one oil lamp in the dormitory (the library used gas lamps). It was not until March 1940 that electric lights were installed in the new campus. Half of the new campus was used as dormitories for students, and the other half was used as classrooms, offices, and a library. All the buildings were extremely simple. The dormitories were all thatched houses: thatched roofs, earthen walls, and ventilated wooden lattice windows. Although some of the classrooms and offices had a layer of lead sheet added to the thatched roofs, the sound of the wind and rain hitting the lead sheet often drowned out the teachers' lectures. As for the thatched dormitories, roof leaks and wall collapses often occurred during the windy and rainy seasons. Every year, the school had to repair the thatched houses. If there was a heavy rain before the repairs, the students' beds would suffer from flooding in the middle of the night. Therefore, it was not uncommon to sleep with an umbrella. During the windy season, the desks and beds in the classrooms, dormitories, and libraries were covered with a layer of yellow soil. It was even more difficult for the students to attend classes. After finishing the first class in "North District No. 1" of the new campus, they had to rush to the "Kunbei Dining Hall" or the "Teachers College" outside the Great Western Gate, which were quite far away, for another class. It was even worse on rainy days, because the new campus was built in a cemetery, and the soil was very loose. When it rained, there was mud everywhere. From the dormitory to the classroom, dining hall, and library, it was a muddy road. If you wore cloth shoes, your shoes would get stuck in the mud as soon as you stepped on it.
In the years after 1941, Japanese imperialist planes came to bomb Kunming almost every day. In August and September 1941, the school's library, dining hall, classrooms, and dormitories were all bombed. After that, it leaked everywhere during the rainy season, and you had to hold an umbrella to read in the library. In order to prevent enemy air raids, valuable instruments and equipment such as microscopes were moved to the countryside, and students had to run fifteen or sixteen miles for experiments. As for the laboratory equipment and library books, they were even more lacking. All there was was some books and instruments brought from Beijing in those years. There was a time when the school's funding was extremely difficult, and even the tacks for hanging maps in class were unaffordable.
As everyone knows, Kunming was one of the cities with the highest prices in the country during the Anti-Japanese War, and the lives of the students of Southwest United University became extremely difficult. It was good enough to be able to eat red rice and vegetarian dishes.
There were also problems with the students' clothes, which were often patched and patched again, and worn-out shoes had to be worn continuously.
Due to the difficulties in life, the students of United University had to live a "part-time" life outside the school. The most common was of course to work part-time as middle school teachers and tutors.
The lives of the teachers of Southwest United University were no exception. They sold their clothes and even their books, but they still had difficulty making ends meet. Their families made soap, snacks, embroidery, etc. to sell. Professor Wen Yiduo had to carve seals for others late at night because of the heavy burden of his family; Professor Wu Han often carried a basket to the vegetable market to buy vegetables before going to class; Professor Zhu Ziqing once wore a felt cloak worn by coachmen to class in winter... These are all unforgettable to everyone. At that time, the professors had no choice but to reduce their living standards to the lowest level.
However, under such difficult circumstances, the vast majority of students and teachers did not stop fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Under the leadership of the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Kunming, the democratic movement flourished in United University. The students and teachers' enthusiasm for struggle and confidence in victory were growing day by day. Therefore, although everyone's life was so hard and unstable, their enthusiasm for learning was still very high.
Under such difficult circumstances, Southwest United University was managed by the school affairs committee jointly formed by the three schools, and these three schools each had different histories and styles, but they were able to get along and cooperate for eight years. This is a good example for today's college and department adjustments.
(II)
When Southwest United University moved back to Beijing and Tianjin, it left behind a normal college in Kunming, which continued to operate at the original site. This is now Kunming Normal College.
Before the liberation of Yunnan, the students of Kunming Normal College participated in the anti-civil war, anti-persecution, and the struggle for freedom and democracy, and many people joined the guerrillas and fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries. When Yunnan was liberated, the students said, "After so many years of struggle, we finally see the sun!" Therefore, on the basis of incomplete school buildings and other facilities, the students and teachers of Kunming Normal College overcame many difficulties under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government and ran the school, and it has developed. Now when we talk about it, everyone is full of confidence.
The "New Campus" was originally planned to be used for only three or four years, but it has now been almost fourteen years. In the past, during the rainy season, the classrooms and dormitories with thatched and lead roofs would leak; the roofs and under the beds in the dormitories were covered with grass. Once, the rainwater flooded the house to a depth of one or two feet, and the entire staff worked hard to dig ditches and rescue the houses. The People's Government timely allocated funds for emergency repairs and repaired the old thatched houses. The girls' dormitory was demolished, and the existing materials were used to convert the two-story building into a single-story building. Last summer vacation, the original library, dining hall, and a large classroom were repaired, which is estimated to last for three years. In addition, with the approval of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, two new two-story houses were built as offices, laboratories, and some classrooms for various departments.
The laboratory equipment in the normal college is very lacking. Professors and students have used their brains to come up with solutions to the difficulties. For example, some small parts for physics experiments are made by themselves; if Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers, or measuring cylinders are broken, everyone uses an alcohol lamp to heat or cut off a section and continues to use them; if the Department of Biology does not have a microscope, they run more than ten miles to Tiannan Middle School in Majiezi every Saturday afternoon to borrow it; some departments also contact Yunnan University to borrow their equipment; if there are no specimens, the professors go to the Heilongtan Botanical Research Institute to borrow them themselves. In this way, experiments can now generally be completed according to the schedule.
The students have also relied on their own strength to improve their lives. When Yunnan was first liberated, everyone still ate some coarse grains, and only seven taels of oil were used for the dishes eaten by more than 400 people at a meal. Later, they reclaimed wasteland, and last summer vacation they harvested about 7,000 catties each of pumpkins, vegetables, and potatoes; they also raised pigs. As a result, the food has been greatly improved.
The students are constantly improving in their studies. At the beginning of last year, when the movement to reduce rent and return deposits in rural areas was in full swing, some students from landlord families had some ideological fluctuations. Later, they were educated through political classes, which stabilized their emotions. In March last year, the students also studied the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" and held a conference to expose the special agents hidden in the school, which further enhanced the students' understanding of the significance of class struggle and raised their vigilance. The school established a security committee to carry out regular security work. For a time, some students believed that "the learning environment of the normal college is too bad, it is best to go to Beijing to study"; some students also made excessive demands on the school, but after learning, this wrong thinking was also corrected.
The patriotic pact has played a great role in promoting. For example, many students did not pay attention to political classes before. Since the patriotic pact was signed, the number of people attending classes has often been more than 90%. They are gradually learning to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. The teachers understand the students' ideological situation before and after class, collect the students' opinions, and can solve the students' problems more practically when lecturing. In terms of conservation, under the promotion of the patriotic pact, the school's electricity consumption decreased by 65% in five months.
Among the new students enrolled in 1951, more than 30 were worker-peasant cadres recommended by various special districts in Yunnan. The students said, "They are our new force." This new force has brought a new revolutionary style to the school, which has not only promoted the students but also the teachers.
The majority of teachers and students of Kunming Normal College clearly realize that after the completion of the land reform in rural areas, the country needs a large number of excellent people's teachers, and their responsibilities are heavy and their future is bright. (Attached picture)

    从西南联合大学到昆明师范学院
    ——在艰苦物质条件下办好学校的一个例证
    吴玉才、柏生
    （一）
    曾经在昆明西南联合大学（以下简称西南联大）学习过的人，谁也不会忘记在昆明时期的那几年生活。
    西南联大是在抗日战争期间，由北京大学、清华大学、南开大学三校合并成立的。北大、清华、南开由北京、天津南迁前各有千余同学；迁到长沙时，有一部分同学英勇地参加了抗日战争。在长沙的师生就成立了长沙临时大学。最后从长沙搬到云南昆明（一九三八年四月），开始称为西南联合大学。当时理工学院在昆明，文法学院在蒙自。一九三八年夏，文法学院也由蒙自搬到昆明。
    西南联大师生的八年教学生活是艰苦的，流动性也很大。光是同学的教室、寝室，就搬了好几次。其中的“新校舍”是在一九三九年落成的，它是西南联大的中心，是西南联大文、理、法三院所在地。这座校舍座落在昆明大西门外的一条黄土马路旁。初建时，连电灯也没有，宿舍里八人共用一盏油灯，（图书馆是用汽灯）。直到一九四○年三月，新校舍才装上了电灯。新校舍一半是同学们的宿舍，一半是教室、办公室，还有一座图书馆。所有的建筑都是极简陋的。宿舍全部是茅草房：草顶、土墙、通风的木格子窗。教室和办公室虽然有一部分是在草顶上加上了一层活的铅板，但若遇到刮风下雨，铅板被风吹雨打的声音，时常压过了教师讲课的声音。而茅草房的宿舍，在风季、雨季常发生屋漏墙倒的事。每年学校对这茅草房都要修补一次，如修补前遇到倾盆的大雨，半夜里同学的床铺就要遭到水患，因此，张着伞睡觉的事，已经不稀奇了。在风季，教室、寝室、图书馆的桌子上、床上，到处是一层黄土。谈到同学们上课的情形，更是困难，在新校舍“北区一号”上完第一课便得赶到离开很远的“昆北食堂”或大西门外“师院”上另一课。要是遇到下雨天，那就更糟了，因为新校舍是在坟场中开辟的，泥土很松，一下雨，到处都是烂泥。从寝室到教室、饭厅、图书馆，是一段泥泞的路，要是穿布鞋，一脚踏下去，鞋子陷在泥里拔不出来了。
    一九四一年以后的几年里，日本帝国主义的飞机几乎每天都要到昆明来轰炸。一九四一年八、九月间，学校的图书馆、饭厅、教室、寝室都被炸坏了。以后一到雨季，就到处漏水，在图书馆里看书必须张着雨伞才行。为了预防敌机的空袭，显微镜等贵重仪器设备都搬到乡间去了，实验时同学们必须跑上十五六里路。至于实验室的设备，以及图书馆的书籍，更是缺乏，所有的只是当年由北京带去的一些图书仪器。有一个时期，学校的经费困难极了，连上课时挂地图用的按钉也买不起。
    谁都知道在抗战期中昆明是全国物价最高的城市之一，西南联大同学的生活发生了极大的困难。能吃到红米、素菜就算不错了。
    同学们的衣服也发生了问题，往往是补了再补，破了又补；鞋底磨穿了，还得继续穿着。
    由于生活的困难，联大同学不得不在外面过着“兼差”的生活。最普遍的当然是兼任中学教员和家庭教师。
    西南联大教师们的生活也并不能例外，他们把自己的衣服，甚至书籍都出卖了，但生活还是难以维持。家属们就自己动手做肥皂、做点心、刺绣等来出卖。闻一多教授因家庭负担重，不得不在深夜代人刻图章；吴晗教授经常提着筐子，到菜市买完菜再去上课；朱自清教授曾经在冬天披着赶马车人穿的毡斗篷上课……这些都是大家所不能忘记的。当时，教授们在无可奈何的情况下都把生活水平降低到最低限度。
    但是，在这样艰苦的情况下，绝大部分的同学和教师，并没有停止对国民党反动派的斗争，在中国共产党昆明地下组织的领导下，民主运动蓬勃地在联大开展起来。同学们和教师们的斗争热情和胜利信心日益增长着，因此，大家的生活虽然那样苦，又不安定，但学习热情还是非常高的。
    西南联大在这样艰苦的情况下，通过三校共同组成的校务委员会办理着校务，而这三个学校各具有着不同的历史和作风，但能相处合作八年。这对于今天的高等学校院系调整是一个很好的榜样。
    （二）
    西南联大迁回北京、天津时，在昆明留下了一个师范学院，在原来的校址继续办下去。这就是现在的昆明师范学院。
    昆明师范学院的同学们在云南解放前曾参加了反内战、反迫害的争取自由、民主的运动，并且有不少人参加了游击队，和国民党反动派进行斗争。云南解放时，学生们都说：“经过多少年的斗争，现在见到太阳了！”于是，在校舍和其他设备都残缺不全的基础上，昆明师范学院的学生和教员们就在人民政府的领导和帮助下克服了许多困难，把学校办了下来，而且有了发展。现在谈起来，大家都是充满了信心的。
    “新校舍”建筑时，原来只准备用三、四年，但到现在却已经快十四年了。从前，一到雨季，那些茅草顶和铅皮顶的教室和宿舍里就漏雨；屋顶上和寝室里的床底下长满了青草。有一回，雨水漫进屋里竟有一、二尺深，全校员工就努力挖了水沟，抢救了房屋。人民政府及时地拨下了抢修费，把旧有的茅草房修理了一下。女生宿舍拆掉了，用原有的材料把二层楼改建成了平房。去年暑假，修理了原来的图书馆、饭厅和一个大教室，估计还可以用三年。另外，又经过西南军政委员会批准，新盖了两座二层的新房子，作为各系的办公室、实验室和一部分教室。
    师范学院实验室里的仪器是非常缺乏的。教授和学生们便都动脑筋想出了解决困难的办法。譬如说：有些物理实验用的小机件就是由他们自己配做的；烧瓶、烧杯或量筒坏了，大家就用酒精灯烧一下或截去一段，还是拿来继续用；博物系没有显微镜，就在每个星期六的下午跑十几里路到马街子天南中学去借用；有的系还和云南大学取得联系，借用他们的设备；没有标本，教授就自己到黑龙潭植物研究所去借。这样，现在一般已能按照进度做完实验了。
    学生们还依靠自己的力量改善了生活。云南刚解放时，大家还吃一部分杂粮，一顿四百多个人吃的菜只用七公两的油。后来他们开辟了荒地，去年暑假就收获了南瓜、青菜和洋芋各约七千斤；另外还养了猪。这样一来，伙食就大大改善了。
    学生们在学习中不断地进步着。去年年初，正当农村中减租退押运动热烈开展时，部分地主家庭出身的学生思想上曾经有些波动，后来通过政治课对他们进行了教育，安定了他们的情绪。去年三月间，学生们又学习了“惩治反革命条例”，召开了检举隐藏在校内的特务分子的大会，使学生们进一步认识了阶级斗争的意义，提高了警惕，学校成立了保卫委员会，进行经常的保卫工作。有一个时期，某些学生认为“师范学院的学习环境太坏了，最好是到北京去念书”；还有一些学生则向学校提出过高的要求，但经过学习，这种错误思想也纠正了。
    爱国公约起了很大的推动作用。例如以前不少学生是不重视政治课的，从订了爱国公约以后，听课的人数经常在百分之九十以上。他们正逐步地在学习运用批评和自我批评的武器。教员在上课前后了解了学生的思想情况，收集了学生的意见，讲课时就能比较实际地解决学生们的问题。节约方面，在爱国公约的推动下，全校的用电量在五个月内减少了百分之六十五。
    一九五一年新招收的学生中，有三十多个是云南各专区保送来的工农干部，同学们说：“他们是我们的生力军。”这批生力军给学校带来了新的革命的作风，不但对学生，而且对教师们也起了推动作用。
    昆明师范学院的大部分师生都清楚地认识到在农村土地改革完成后，国家需要大批优秀的人民教师，他们的责任是重大的，前途是光明的。（附图片）
