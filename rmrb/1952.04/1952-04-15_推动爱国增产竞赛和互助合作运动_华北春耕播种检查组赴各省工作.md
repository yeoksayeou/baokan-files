    Promote Patriotic Production Increase Competition and Mutual Aid Cooperation Movement
    North China Spring Ploughing and Sowing Inspection Team Goes to Various Provinces to Work
    The Spring Ploughing and Sowing Inspection Team, composed of the agricultural, forestry, and civil affairs departments of the North China Administrative Council, with cadres from the Youth Work Committee and the Women's Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee participating, departed on the 10th for Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces to inspect spring ploughing and sowing, the work of farming on behalf of families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and to promote the patriotic production increase competition movement in various places.
    The day before the inspection team departed, Zhang Su, Deputy Director of the North China Administrative Council, summoned all members of the inspection team for a speech. Zhang Su pointed out: "Spring ploughing and sowing is a complex and arduous task. Governments at all levels must lead the peasants with their main strength, and leaders at all levels must personally go to the countryside to supervise and inspect, in order to guarantee the successful completion of spring ploughing and sowing. Therefore, the inspection team must first check whether the leadership strength in each province, special district, and county is strong enough, and correct the tendency of some areas to only focus on the 'Three-Anti's' and neglect production. Getting organized is a crucial key to doing a good job in spring ploughing and sowing. Only by getting organized can we better utilize manpower, animal power, farm tools, and technology, and do a good job in many tasks such as sowing, farming on behalf of others, opening canals, digging wells, and disaster relief. This year, North China requires that the agricultural production labor force organized should reach 70% to 80% of the total labor force, which is an arduous task. To this end, all localities should, in this leadership of spring ploughing and sowing work, expand and consolidate various mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, in order to gradually achieve this year's requirements." Zhang Su instructed the inspection team to carefully check the preparatory work for spring ploughing and sowing in various places, and for areas that have not made good preparations, to urge them to quickly find ways to remedy the situation and ensure that no time is wasted in farming.

    推动爱国增产竞赛和互助合作运动
    华北春耕播种检查组赴各省工作
    华北行政委员会农林、民政部门组成的、并有中共中央华北局青年工作委员会和妇女工作委员会干部参加的春耕播种检查组，已在十日出发，分赴河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、绥远等省，检查春耕播种和各地为烈士家属、革命军人家属代耕的工作，并推动各地的爱国增产竞赛运动。
    检查组出发前一日，华北行政委员会副主任张苏曾召集检查组全体同志讲话。张苏指出：“春耕播种是复杂而又艰巨的任务，各级政府必须以主要力量领导农民，并由各级首长亲自下乡督促检查，才能保证春耕播种的胜利完成。因此，检查组首先要检查各省、各专区、各县的领导力量是否雄厚，纠正某些只顾‘三反’，忽视生产的偏向。组织起来是搞好春耕播种的重要关键。只有组织起来才能更好发挥人力、畜力、农具和技术的效力，才能作好播种、代耕、开渠、打井、救灾等许多工作。今年华北要求组织起来的农业生产劳动力达到劳动力总数的百分之七十到百分之八十，这个任务是繁重的。为此，各地应在这次领导春耕播种工作中，扩大和巩固各种互助组和农业生产合作社，以求逐步达到今年的要求。”张苏嘱咐检查组要仔细检查各地春耕播种的准备工作，对没有作好准备的地区，要督促他们迅速设法补救，保证不误农时。
