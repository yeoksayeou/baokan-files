Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 17th: The Xi'an People's Court's district tribunals have begun trying seriously illegal industrial and commercial households since the 11th. The first batch of 82 households has been sentenced, and the remaining seriously illegal households will be sentenced successively soon. Before the opening of the tribunals, each district tribunal made full preparations, carefully studied and verified the materials, consulted the opinions of workers and shop assistants, and conducted preliminary trials before finalizing the cases. The district tribunals all embodied the principle of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance" in their pronouncements.

	The Fifth Tribunal sentenced 19 seriously illegal households on the 13th. Among them, the Yan'an Automobile Materials Firm and the Jixiang Tire Repair Shop both had serious illegal acts of tax evasion and theft of state property. The Yan'an Automobile Materials Firm stole over 100 million yuan of state property and evaded over 30 million yuan in taxes in 1951. These two households should have been treated as seriously illegal households, but because their confessions were relatively good and they could persuade others to confess, they were treated leniently and reduced to semi-law-abiding, semi-illegal households. The Lizhong Automobile Materials Firm's bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property were not too serious, and it could have been classified as a semi-law-abiding, semi-illegal household, but the firm's manager, Huang Guangren, refused to confess and burned account books and receipts, and fabricated false accounts. Therefore, he was dealt with severely and reclassified as a seriously illegal household. The bribery part was doubled in punishment, and all evaded taxes were paid and all stolen property was returned. The convicted illegal households all believed that the People's Court's judgments were fair and reasonable, expressed their satisfaction, and submitted refund guarantees on the spot. The capitalist of the Lihua Automobile Materials Firm in the Fourth District handed over a portion of the stolen money the day after the court sentence was pronounced.

    西安市人民法庭判处一批严重违法工商户
    【新华社西安十七日电】西安市人民法庭各区分庭从十一日开始，先后开庭审讯严重违法工商户，第一批共已判处八十二户，其余各严重违法户将在最近陆续判处完毕，各区分庭开庭之前，都做了充分的准备工作，详细研究和对证材料，征询工人店员意见，并进行预审，然后才定案。各区分庭在宣判中都体现了“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的原则。第五分庭十三日判处十九户严重违法户。其中延安汽车材料行和吉祥补带行，都有严重偷漏税款、盗窃国家资财的违法行为。延安汽车材料行盗窃国家财产达一亿元以上，一九五一年偷漏税款三千多万元。这两户本应按严重违法户论处，因他们坦白尚好，还能劝导别人坦白，所以从轻处理，都减轻为半守法半违法户。利中汽车材料行，行贿、偷漏税款和盗窃国家资财情节不太严重，本可列为半守法半违法户，但该行经理黄光仁拒不坦白，并焚毁账目和单据，重新制造假账，因此受到从严处理，被改列为严重违法户，行贿部分加倍处罚，补交全部偷漏税款和退出全部盗窃财产。已定案的各违法户都认为人民法庭的判决公平合理，表示悦服，当场递交退款保证书。四区利华汽车材料行资方，在开庭宣判第二天便交出了一部分赃款。
