    Diligence Bookstore's Response to Criticism of "Latest Basketball Basic Training Illustrated"
    Editor: After reading the article "Eliminate Pro-American Ideology in Sports Books" published in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on February 13th, we believe that Comrade Hu Shuangbao's criticism of our bookstore's publication of "Latest Basketball Basic Training Illustrated" is entirely correct. In addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude to him, we have already stopped selling the book.

    In the future, we will seriously study, actively introduce the advanced experience of Soviet sports and our country's sports experience, and strive to do our publishing work well.　Diligence Bookstore

    勤奋书局对批评“最新篮球基本训练图解”的答复
    编辑同志：读了二月十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”所载“清除体育书籍中的崇美思想”一文，我们认为，胡双宝同志在该文中对我店出版的“最新篮球基本训练图解”一书的批评是完全正确的。我们除了对他表示衷心的感谢外，并已将该书停售。
    今后我们当认真进行学习，积极介绍苏联体育的先进经验和我国体育的经验，努力做好我们的出版工作。　勤奋书局
