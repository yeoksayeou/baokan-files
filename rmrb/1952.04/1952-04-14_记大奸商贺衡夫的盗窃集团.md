    Record of the Great Profiteer He Hengfu's Theft Group
    Gu Wenhua
    He Hengfu's large theft group not only stole a large amount of state assets, but also smuggled and sold gold and drugs on a large scale, and privately transported strategic materials abroad. Their business included: tung oil, opium, morphine, gold, tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, gasoline, and gauze, etc.; they stole as much as they could, and stole everything they could operate.
    In order to carry out these activities, He Hengfu's large theft group exhausted all kinds of treacherous schemes. They stole national economic intelligence; they seized the power to lead the national economic organs; they seduced the cadres of the national economic organs. As for general bribery and tax evasion, that was even more commonplace.
    He Hengfu was ostensibly a member of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, a member of the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee, a member of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, a representative of the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress, and the director of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce; in reality, he was a loyal disciple of the Kuomintang, an important figure in both the "Green" and "Red" gangs, and a "Shantang" preacher. People in the profiteer group respectfully called him "Seventh Master" (he was the seventh child in his family), and the vast number of industrialists and businessmen called him "Fire Sparrow" and "Crystal Monkey" behind his back, because he started his career by killing and arson, and was a person who "took advantage of all sides and speculated on all sides." As stated in the Han口 Great Grain Branch employee's letter of accusation: "The great profiteer He Hengfu, wearing the cloak of a 'democratic personage,' usurped the leading position in the industrial and commercial circles and infiltrated the People's Government. He shouted slogans of serving the people, but secretly engaged in activities that endangered the country. The crimes of the He Hengfu-led theft group are a typical example of the bourgeoisie's organized and planned, frantic attack on the people's democratic regime."
    I. He Hengfu's True Colors
    Wuhan is the largest tung oil distribution market in China, and also the most convenient port for exporting tung oil.
    He Hengfu worked as an apprentice in the Rongchang Oil Shop in Wuhan in 1908. His colleagues at the time gave him the nickname "Scourge." He Hengfu's father was also a shop assistant, serving in the Weixin Pawnshop opened by the warlord Lü Chaobo (who was also the director of the Hubei Salt Affairs Bureau at the time). He Hengfu therefore climbed up to the warlord Lü Chaobo. After working as an apprentice for three years, He Hengfu opened an oil and salt workshop in Huanglingji, Hanyang; the oil was borrowed from the Rongchang Oil Shop, and the salt was stolen from the Salt Affairs Bureau. But theft was not enough, he once committed murder and arson to obtain "ill-gotten wealth." In 1921, he sold 300 tons of tung oil (equivalent to 6,000 dans). At that time, each dan was 48 taels of silver, and he adulterated the oil to extract huge profits, adding mixed oil (soybean oil, sesame oil, and tung oil residue) worth 20 taels of silver per dan into the tung oil, with the adulteration reaching 60 percent. He made a huge profit of 11,000 taels of silver at one time, but the two buyers committed suicide by jumping into the sea because they were deceived too badly to return the goods. During this period, he ran to foreign firms every day and became acquainted with imperialist merchants. According to his own confession, he set three fires, and the one in Hanyang was the most "profitable." That was in 1923, when he piled oil in a wooden-framed warehouse in Hanyang. He insured both his customers' oil and his own oil for a total of 110,000 silver dollars, and then made a plan to set the fire. Two days before the fire, he moved all the oil in the factory out. That night, he instructed a "geomancer" who was in charge of guarding his ancestral graves to set a fire. This time, he relied on the power of the Chamber of Commerce to coerce the insurance company to compensate him, and he actually received 110,000 silver dollars in insurance money; the profit he secretly swallowed from his customers' tung oil was not included. This is how He Hengfu started his career by currying favor with warlords and foreign merchants, and harming his compatriots.
    Because of his smooth methods, He Hengfu held important positions in the industrial and commercial circles of Wuhan City from 1927. Around 1927, he was the chairman of the Oil Industry Association and a standing director of the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Around 1931, he was the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. After liberation, he was the director of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. In 1947, he also served as a member of the Kuomintang's "Suppression of Rebellion Committee" and a puppet Wuhan City Councilor. He was truly "both a businessman and an official," and "both an official and a businessman." After liberation, he used deceptive means to infiltrate the People's Government. People called him "the tumbler" and "the old fox."
    The reason why he was able to infiltrate the People's Government was because he arranged a clever plan. When the People's Liberation Army approached Wuhan in 1949, he stole a batch of materials and transferred them to Hong Kong. He wanted to dispose of this "property" and also see which way the wind was blowing, so he colluded with the Kuomintang army to "search" his house while he was "hiding" in a friend's house. He used "avoiding the chaos" as an excuse to go to Hong Kong, and also used this to pretend to be progressive and curry favor with the people who were about to be liberated. The People's Government was magnanimous and tried to win him over to return to the country to participate in work, hoping that he would lead the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan City and serve the people well. But when he saw that his trick had been realized, he boldly resumed his theft activities.
    He used various two-faced tactics to win the support of backward elements among the industrialists and businessmen in Wuhan City. He told people: "In public, we must speak according to policy, but behind our backs, we must tell the truth." In order to undermine the credibility of the people's tax policy, he clamored in March and April 1950: "Zhang Luo advances the goods, and Wu Nengguang will definitely be finished in May." (At that time, the director of the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau was Comrade Zhang Xianjin, and the director of the Finance Bureau was Comrade Wu Nengguang; he used the homophones of these two comrades' names to clamor that capitalists "will be finished in May.") He shouted that "taxes are heavy" and scolded the People's Government as "killing the chicken to get the eggs" in order to cover up their theft activities. His political offensive did not stop there. He even went so far as to openly sabotage at the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress. While shouting "Long live the Communist Party," he turned around and winked at the industrial and commercial representatives and said: "Comrades! We can only take tonics, not laxatives." These conspiracies of his political offensive were closely linked to his economic theft activities.
    Even during this "Five-Anti" movement, He Hengfu still pretended to be innocent and said: "Those who seek false fame instead of practical knowledge will surely suffer a strange disaster." In fact, his theft crimes have already shocked the whole country, and this can no longer be covered up by "false fame." While advocating that the industrial and commercial circles should "strive for initiative and confess early," he released the above-mentioned mysterious evasive statement. In addition to these "policy words," he secretly spread rumors saying: "The Five-Anti is just for money." "People go into the water, and money rises up the slope." He used this to instruct his theft group to transfer property abroad. His two-faced tactics did not stop there. While "taking the lead in self-criticism," he warned Liu Yi, an important member of his group, after hearing that Liu had confessed to illegally obtaining foreign exchange, saying: "You can't go on like this! You must know how powerful I, He Hengfu, am. I am a member of the Military and Political Committee and an important figure in both the 'Green' and 'Red' gangs."
    II. Organizing a Secret Group
    When He Hengfu returned to Wuhan from Hong Kong in January 1950, he convened a secret meeting of the backbone members of the profiteer theft group he led, and declared: "Now we should strengthen the original team from the past." The so-called "original team" referred to the seven oil shops and two international trading companies; the so-called "strengthening" referred to the huge theft network later formed by the profiteers through the methods of "sending in" and "pulling over." At the second secret meeting in February and March, He Hengfu solemnly instructed: "Our organization is already sound, but we must pay attention to future work and be particularly cautious and discreet." This group's organization was strict, and its plans were meticulous. He Hengfu's conspiracy offensive and theft arrangements were premeditated.
    The backbone of He Hengfu's large theft group before liberation was the famous "Seven Oil Shops," namely: Qianchang, Yongsheng, Jinchang, Qichang, Yuanchang, Chunyuan, and Tongyi. These seven oil shops could control the tung oil market in Wuhan. They organized the "Seven Oil Shops Dinner Party" and planned speculative trading. In early 1949, the two international trading companies, Yirui and Huanian, also joined; because Yirui and Huanian had a reputation in tung oil transactions with imperialism and could take on the task of directly exporting stolen goods. At that time, the Huaihai Campaign was victorious, and the Kuomintang reactionary group collapsed across the board. He Hengfu convened a meeting of the profiteer group at his private residence, "Yilu," to discuss stealing enemy and puppet materials that were about to belong to the people. This group was headed by He Hengfu, assisted by Zhang Lisheng and Li Jingwen, with Liu Yi as the accountant, Zhang Lisheng concurrently serving as the general affairs officer, He Hesun (He Hengfu's eldest son) as the financial officer, Zhang Dasheng as the business officer, and Liu Xinru (before March 1950, it was Liu Yi) as the secretary. The other members included Zhu Xianzhi, Yu Xiuting, and Ye Jiao'an, Tang Youyu, Zhou Dexi, and Wu Yuting, who assisted with general affairs and business. The members of this large theft group were the bosses and managers of the above-mentioned seven oil shops and two trading companies. He Hengfu was the owner of Qianchang Oil Shop, Zhang Lisheng was the owner of Yongsheng Oil Shop, He's nephew Li Jingwen was the manager of Yirui Trading Company, and Liu Yi was the assistant manager of Huanian Trading Company. This large theft group, together with Yang Shouyan, manager of the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory, Zhu Tingmo, deputy manager, and senior staff members Sun Guangyu and Sun Jiasong, as well as Wang Baiqing of Yuehan Chang Transportation Company and other related figures, stole a large amount of materials from the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory.
    After returning to Wuhan in January 1950, He Hengfu gradually expanded the theft organization. The people they continued to pull in included Yang Xiaoyan, head of the Business Section of the Hubei Provincial Trading Company (Ye Jiao'an's brother-in-law, sent in by Ye), Xu Zhongyi, deputy director of the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration Bureau, Yan Ge, head of the Import and Export Agency Section of the bureau, Ni Tongjia, head of the Administrative Section of the bureau (sent in by Li Jingwen under He Hengfu's instruction), Chen Anxing (whom He Hengfu wanted to "keep" in the Bank of China) and Ke Yuncheng, deputy managers of the Bank of China, Xue Jigang and Xiong Huiqun of the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau, and Tang Shungeng of the Central-South Oil and Fat Company, etc. Subsequently, in order to facilitate theft and smuggling, the seven oil shops successively switched to the international trade industry, and the group name was changed to "International Trade Luncheon Club." After the establishment of the International Trade Business Association, this group appeared as the "Oil and Fat Group" of the association in order to obtain public legal status, facilitate concealment of smuggling and theft activities, and facilitate attacks on state economic organs and state-owned trade.
    III. Exhausting Every Means of Theft
    With the large profiteer He Hengfu at the head, what did the theft group do? They stole a large amount of state assets and important national economic intelligence, they boldly smuggled gold for export and sold drugs for import, and they also privately transported a large amount of strategic materials such as tungsten, antimony, and tin for export.
    Let's first talk about their theft activities. This issue can be divided into two aspects: stealing national economic intelligence and stealing materials.
    He Hengfu's large theft group used their pawns and the convenience of He Hengfu's position to steal important national economic intelligence. When He Hengfu participated in the Second Committee Meeting of the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee on September 26, 1950, the economic intelligence he obtained included: the production and sales situation and adjustment methods of grain in Central-South China (with 12 copies of grain production and sales reference materials attached), instructions on the leadership issues of public and private enterprises, the outline of the cooperative work plan for Central-South China in 1950, the general situation of the five major production industries of textiles, cigarettes, coal, matches, and oil pressing in Central-South China and the production and sales plan for the second half of 1950, and reference materials for adjusting the relationship between public and private industries, etc., a total of 17 important documents and reference materials. These documents were issued to the committee members attending the meeting to prepare their opinions, and were stipulated to be returned the next day. The profiteer He Hengfu took these documents back to the Federation of Industry and Commerce and had more than 20 staff members copy them overnight. At 2:00 p.m. on February 9, 1951, the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee held its 35th committee meeting. The document on the summary of forestry in Central-South China in 1950 and the forestry production plan for 1951, reported by Zhu Jianghu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, was also stolen by He Hengfu. He sent it to bamboo and wood merchants in Hanyang for circulation, which facilitated their speculative activities and caused significant losses to the national forestry in Hunan and other places.
    In order to break the "economic blockade" of American imperialism, the People's Government planned to adopt a "barter trade" policy. Before it was announced, He Hengfu obtained this intelligence from Xu Zhongyi. On the one hand, he sent a special person to send this intelligence and detailed barter projects to Hong Kong so that American imperialism could immediately intensify its "blockade" against us; on the other hand, he肆意spread rumors and slandered it in the domestic market, calling this method a "dead method." At that time, the profiteers had a batch of tung oil that they wanted to export, so they clamored that restricting tung oil exports was a "tung oil pending case." Later, when exports were allowed, "the loss of state property reached 8 billion yuan" (Li Jingwen confessed).
    After Xu Zhongyi, deputy director of the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration Bureau, and others joined the theft group, the bureau was actually usurped. Some important economic intelligence that the Central Government and Central-South China were considering but had not yet announced was provided to the profiteers by Xu Zhongyi. Liu Xinru, an important member of this theft group, could go to Ni Tongjia at any time to see secret international economic intelligence and could copy it and take it back.
    In 1951, when He Hengfu attended a meeting of the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee, after obtaining economic intelligence on the 1951 loan plan of the Central-South Branch of the People's Bank of China, he organized his theft group to actively attack the national bank. Qianchang alone obtained more than 24 billion yuan in loans from the Bank of China in 1951. In addition to using economic intelligence to organize attacks, He Hengfu also combined the spy activities of his moles Chen Anxing and Ke Yuncheng to obtain particularly convenient opportunities for loans. For example, most of the tung oil he pledged was empty barrels, and he only used barrels filled with tung oil around the edges to cover up, and he could get the loan.
    Now let's talk about their theft of state assets—tung oil. According to preliminary statistics from the accusation materials, the tung oil stolen by He Hengfu's theft group before and after liberation reached more than 526,700 dans; at 540,000 yuan per dan, it was worth a total of 284.418 billion yuan. Among these 500,000-plus dans of tung oil, about 350,000 dans were enemy property from the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory. When the good news of the victory of the Huaihai Campaign was frequently reported in 1948, the tung oil of the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory scattered in the warehouses and barges of the Minsheng, Sanbei, and China Merchants Bureau companies in Wuhan, as well as the oil stored in various oil shops and on 30 private ships, was about to belong to the people. At a secret meeting of profiteers in January 1949, He Hengfu said: "These materials are ours. The Communist Party is our enemy, and we cannot leave a bit for them." Therefore, they emptied the stored oil by the following methods: 1. The tung oil stored by the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory in various oil shops was directly transported away by the various oil shops; 2. The various oil shops went directly to the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory to unload oil in the name of buying cheap oil, or directly changed the brand of the oil from the puppet China Vegetable Oil Factory from various producing areas and transshipped it away on the river; 3. Those that could not be rushed to transport were dispersed and stored in the name of various oil shops and gradually loaded and exported after liberation.
    After liberation, this theft group boldly stole tung oil from the Central-South Oil and Fat Company and the Hubei Provincial Trading Company (formerly the Native Products Company). There were several ways they stole it: 1. Privately transporting public stored oil for export as their working capital. 2.抢夺Seizing. For example, in October 1950, the Oil and Fat Company stored 5,300 dans of oil in Qichang Oil Shop. He Hengfu instructed Zhu Xianyuan, a profiteer in Qichang Oil Shop, to collude with the corrupt element Tang Shungeng and take advantage of the opportunity of a large amount of oil and fat pouring into the Oil and Fat Company to adopt the method of "driving horses and mixing mules" and simply cancel the warehouse receipt of Qichang. This batch of tung oil became the property of the profiteers, changed the brand, and was transported abroad. Another example is that in early June 1950, the Hubei Provincial Trading Company had more than 20 wooden boats from the producing area, carrying a total of more than 2,700 iron barrels of tung oil (100,260 dans), a total of 20 carts. At that time, He Hengfu's group sent a large number of people to brush 10 carts of this batch of oil into "Huanian" brand and 10 carts into "Yirui" brand in two days, with all kinds of procedures in place. A few days later, this batch of oil was handed over to Changcheng and Yuehan Yu Transportation Companies and transported to Tianjin for transshipment to Hong Kong. 3. Colluding with inside agents to steal processed oil by using inferior goods as good goods and using bad oil as samples of good oil so that the public would not want to purchase it.
    All the export cargo documents that this theft group should have handled were forged and handled by inside agents. Li Jingwen and Liu Xinru, important members of the theft group, colluded with Ni Tongjia, the mole sent into the Foreign Trade Administration Bureau, and Chen Zhongyi, who was pulled over, and stole 100 originals of blank import and export licenses with the bureau's seal, which were distributed to various oil shops. The seal of the Bank of China in Hankou was affixed by Chen Anxing, and they filled it in themselves when needed. Xue Jigang and Xiong Huiqun, corrupt elements pulled over from the Taxation Bureau, were responsible for providing fake invoices, movement documents, and blank tax票stamps, which they filled in when needed. They sent the stamp style of the People's Bank of China required on the tax票stamps to Hong Kong, had a copy engraved in Hong Kong, and brought it back for storage in the hands of Xue Jigang and Xiong Huiqun. Transportation was handled by Wang Baiqing, a profiteer in Yuehan Chang Transportation Company. The Guangzhou Yirui Trading Company was responsible for the Shenzhen customs on the Guangzhou export side, and colluded with inspection personnel in Hong Kong. The tight organization of this theft group made all stolen and smuggled goods pass in and out unimpeded.
    In addition to stealing tung oil, they also stole materials such as cotton yarn, cotton, and cotton cloth. The numbers were also astonishing, but I won't list them in detail here. As for the private export of other materials, there were also many, such as gallnuts, fungus, pig bristles, cattle and sheep skins, raw lacquer, soybean cake, ramie, white fungus, soybean oil, raw kernels, sack, sesame, tea oil, sesame oil, vegetable oil, and leather oil among native products, and precious medicinal materials such as angelica, musk, tuckahoe, and rhubarb, as well as military materials such as mercury, tungsten, antimony, camphor oil, machine oil, gasoline, and iron barrels.
    IV. Smuggling Gold and Selling Drugs
    The quantity of materials stolen by He Hengfu's large theft group was alarming, and the seriousness of their smuggling of gold for export and the sale of drugs, as well as the enormity of the quantity, was even more alarming.
    He Hengfu's large theft group smuggled a large amount of gold, silver dollars, US dollars, diamonds, and platinum for export, and贩in smuggled opium, heroin, morphine, white powder, and red pills. They put gold, etc., in tung oil barrels for export, and put drugs in milk powder, canned food, etc., for import. The ways they disguised import and export smuggling were endless. They exported these contraband items in tung oil, medicinal materials, bran, raw lacquer, sesame, green beans, gallnuts, and corn, and they also imported opium in typewriters, and some were placed in颜料pigments, lithopone, and even car tires. Once, they smuggled 60,000 taels of morphine into the country from India disguised as "high-grade insurance powder."
    It is also difficult to count the numbers of gold, drugs, etc., smuggled in and out. According to Li Jingwen's confession, he only knew that after liberation, he贩in smuggled 500,000 taels of white powder and 3.5 million taels of opium, and exported 3 million taels of gold; before liberation, he贩in smuggled 480,000 taels of opium and 65,000 taels of white powder. According to the accusation of Zhu Boyu, a senior staff member of Jinchang Trading Company, 860,000 taels of gold were smuggled for export after liberation.
    When gold was exported and drugs were imported, the members of this theft group used a set of secret codes to contact each other in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Hankou. The code name for gold was "Huang Cen," the code name for opium was "Ink," the code name for morphine was "Milk Powder," and so on.
    It is impossible to count how many good people were harmed by the profiteers贩in selling large quantities of drugs. How can their滔天heinous crimes not arouse the righteous indignation of all patriotic people in China!
    V. Must Be Thoroughly Sanctioned
    The evils of He Hengfu's large smuggling and drug贩in theft group mentioned above are only a small part of the entire case. The accusations against He Hengfu's theft case, as some workers and shop assistants said, "cannot be finished in three days and three nights." The joint struggle meeting held by the seven oil shops in Wuhan City lasted for four days, but the accusations have not yet ended, and more than 60 people have requested to make accusations. The cracking of He Hengfu's large theft case has increased our struggle experience, further deepened our understanding of the ugly faces of the bourgeoisie, and further deepened our understanding of the seriousness and complexity of their狂狂frenzied attacks. The staff and workers and shop assistants who participated in the "Five-Anti" movement in Wuhan City are determined and confident to clarify the entire case of this theft group, and they must also very well sanction this group of profiteers. The attack of this smuggling and drug贩in theft group headed by He Hengfu on the Communist Party, the working class, and the People's Government is extremely frantic and extremely serious. They stole a large amount of state and people's property to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. These people are no longer simple profiteers, but a gang of fierce robbers and a group of loyal lackeys of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries! In order to consolidate the leadership of the working class and safeguard the fruits of revolutionary victory, all our patriotic people should unite to besiege the large profiteers and thoroughly eliminate all theft groups of profiteers.

    记大奸商贺衡夫的盗窃集团
    顾文华
    贺衡夫的大盗窃集团，不仅大量盗窃国家资财，而且大规模地走私贩卖黄金、毒品，私运战略物资到国外。他们的业务是：桐油、鸦片、吗啡、黄金、钨、锑、锡、水银、汽油和纱布等等；几乎凡是能盗窃者尽量盗窃，凡是能够经营者都要盗窃。
    贺衡夫大盗窃集团为了进行这些勾当，用尽了一切奸计。国家的经济情报，他们是要偷的；国家经济机关的业务领导权，他们是要夺的；国家经济机关的干部，他们是要勾引的。至于一般的行贿、偷税漏税，那就更是家常便饭了。
    贺衡夫表面上是中南军政委员会的委员、中南财政经济委员会委员、武汉市人民政府委员、武汉市各界人民代表会议代表、武汉市工商联筹委会主任；其实是国民党的忠实门徒，“青”“洪”两帮的要人，“善堂”的点传师。奸商集团中人尊称之为“七爷”（他排行第七），广大工商业者背后叫他“火雀子”、“水晶猴子”，因为他是杀人放火起家，又是“四面取巧、八面投机”的人物。正如汉口大成分行职工检举书上所说：“大奸商贺衡夫，披着‘民主人士’的外衣，窃踞工商界领导地位，混入了人民政府，他口里喊着为人民服务，暗地里却干着危害国家的勾当。以贺衡夫为首的盗窃集团的罪恶，正是资产阶级有组织有计划地疯狂地向人民民主政权进攻的典型例子。”    一、贺衡夫的真面目
    武汉是我国最大的桐油集散市场，也是出口桐油最便利的口岸。
    贺衡夫于一九零八年就在武汉荣昌油行当学徒，当时的同事们给他起了个“祸害”的绰号。贺衡夫的父亲也是个店员，服务于军阀吕超伯（又是当时湖北盐务局长）开设的维新当铺。贺衡夫因之攀上了军阀吕超伯。贺衡夫做了三年学徒以后，就在汉阳黄陵矶开了一个油盐坊；油是向荣昌油行借的，盐是偷盐务局的。但偷窃还嫌不足，他曾经杀人放火取得“横财”。一九二一年，他卖出了三百吨桐油（合六千担），当时每担四十八两银子，他就掺假掺杂攫取暴利，将二十两银子一担的杂油（豆油麻油梓油的脚油）放在桐油里面，掺假成分达到百分之六十。他一次获得暴利一万一千两银子，但这两个买主因为上当太大，不好回去交货，因之跳海自杀。这个时期，他每天跑洋行，又结识了帝国主义商人。据他自己供认，他曾先后放了三次火，而以在汉阳放的一次“得利”最大。那是在一九二三年，他在汉阳木架栈房中堆油，他把客户的存油和自己的油一共保险十一万银元，保险之后订下放火计划。放火之前两天，他把厂中的存油全部下走。到那天晚上，他指使为他看管坟山地脉的一个“阴阳”先生放了一把火。这次他依仗商会势力，胁迫保险行赔偿，他实得保险费十一万银元；至于他暗吞客户桐油所得，还未算在内。贺衡夫就是这样巴结军阀、洋商，祸害祖国同胞起家的。
    贺衡夫由于手段圆滑，从一九二七年起，就在武汉市工商业界任要职。一九二七年左右是油业公会理事长、汉口市商会常务理事，一九三一年左右是商会理事长，解放后又是武汉市工商联筹委会主任。他在一九四七年还做过国民党“戡乱委员会”委员、伪武汉市参议员，真是“亦商亦官”，“亦官亦商”。解放后，他用欺骗手段混入了人民政府。人们称他为“不倒翁”，又名“老狐狸”。
    他之所以能够混入人民政府，是安排了巧计的。当一九四九年人民解放军逼近武汉时，他盗窃了一批物资，转运到香港。这批“财产”要处理，又要看风色，于是他就串通国民党军队，在他“藏”在朋友家里的时候，“抄”了他的家，他就用“避乱”为藉口到香港去，也以此假装进步，讨好于即将获得解放的人民。人民政府宽大为怀，争取他回国参加工作，企望他领导武汉市工商界，好好为人民服务。但他看见诡计已经实现，就大胆地重干起盗窃勾当来。
    他以多样的两面手段，取得了武汉市工商业者中的落后分子的拥护。他对人表示：“公开场合要讲政策话，背后要讲老实话。”他为了破坏人民税政的信誉，在一九五零年三、四月间叫嚣说：“张罗先进货，五月定能光。”（当时武汉市税务局长是张先进同志，财政局长是伍能光同志；他借这两个同志的名字的字音，叫嚣说资本家“五月就要完蛋了。”）他喊叫“税重”，骂人民政府是“杀鸡取蛋”，以掩护他们的盗窃勾当。他的政治进攻还不止此。他竟猖狂到在武汉市各界人民代表会议上公开破坏。他一边高呼“共产党万岁”，接着就回过头来对工商业代表挤眉弄眼说：“伙计们！我们只能吃补药，不能吃泻药了。”他这些政治进攻的阴谋，紧密地结合着他的经济盗窃活动。
    直到这次“五反”运动中，贺衡夫还猩猩作态地说：“不求实学而求虚名，必遭奇祸。”其实，他的盗窃罪行已经震惊全国，这已不是“虚名”所能掩盖的了。他一面主张工商界要“争取主动，早日坦白”，一面放出上边这种玄妙的遁词。他在这些
    “政策话”之外，暗地里造谣说：“五反就是要钱。”“人下水，钱起坡。”以此指示他的盗窃集团转移财产到国外。他的两面手腕还不止此。他一面“带头检讨”，一面在听到他的集团中的重要分子刘艺坦白套取外汇后，警告刘说：“你这样下去是不行的！你要知道我贺衡夫的厉害，我是军政委员会的委员，又是‘青’‘洪’两帮的要人。”
    二、组织秘密集团
    贺衡夫在一九五零年一月从香港回到武汉，就召集他领导的奸商盗窃集团的班底，开了一个秘密会议，宣称：“现在我们应该把过去的原班人马加强起来。”所谓“原班人马”，就是七家油行和两家国际贸易行；所谓“加强起来”，就是后来奸商们分别以“派进来”“拉过去”的手法组成的巨大的盗窃网。贺衡夫在二、三月间第二次秘密会上郑重交代：“我们这个组织已经健全了，不过要注意今后的工作，特别谨慎和检点。”这个集团的组织严密，计划周详，贺衡夫的阴谋进攻、布置盗窃是蓄谋已久的了。
    贺衡夫大盗窃集团在解放前的班底，原是有名的
    “七家油行”，即：乾昌、永生、晋昌、其昌、源昌、春源、同义。这七家油行是可以左右武汉的桐油市场的。它们组织了“七家油行聚餐会”，计划着投机买卖。一九四九年初，义瑞与华年两家国际贸易行又加入了；因为义瑞与华年在与帝国主义进行桐油交易中是有牌子的，可以担负把盗窃所得直接输往国外的任务。当时，淮海战役胜利了，国民党反动集团全线崩溃，贺衡夫在他的私宅“怡庐”召集奸商集团会议，商讨盗窃即将归于人民所有的敌伪物资。这个集团以贺衡夫为首脑，张利生、李景文副之，会计是刘艺，总务是张利生兼，财务是贺荷荪（贺衡夫之长子），业务是张达生，秘书是刘心如（一九五零年三月以前为刘艺），以上都是核心人物。其他还有事务朱显之，参议俞秀庭，帮助总务与业务者为叶教菴、唐友于、周德玺、吴雨庭。这个大盗窃集团的成员即为上述七家油行和两家贸易行的老板、经理等。贺衡夫是乾昌油行的老板，张利生是永生油行的老板，贺的外甥李景文是义瑞行的经理，刘艺是华年行的协理。这个大盗窃集团汇同伪中国植物油料厂经理杨守衍、副经理朱庭漠、高级职员孙光裕、孙家松等，以及粤汉长运输行的汪柏青及其他有关人物，盗窃了伪中国植物油料厂的大量物资。
    贺衡夫在一九五零年一月回武汉后，就逐步扩大了盗窃组织。他们继续拉进去的人有湖北省贸易公司业务科长杨孝炎（叶教菴的内弟，由叶派进去的），武汉对外贸易管理局副局长许锺毅，该局进出口代理科长严格，该局行政科代理科长倪同甲（由贺衡夫指使李景文派进去的），中国银行副理陈安性（贺衡夫要他“留”在中国银行里的）、柯云程，武汉市税务局的薛吉罡、熊惠群，中南油脂公司的汤舜耕等。此后七家油行为了便于盗窃和走私，先后转营国际贸易业，便把集团名义改为“国际贸易轮餐会”。国际贸易商业会成立后，这个集团就以该会的“油脂小组”的面目出现，以取得公开合法地位，便于隐蔽走私盗窃活动，也便于向国家经济机关及国营贸易进攻。
    三、极尽盗窃之能事
    以大奸商贺衡夫为首的盗窃集团组成了，他们干些什么事呢？他们盗窃了大量国家资财和国家重要经济情报，他们胆大包天地走私黄金出口和贩卖毒品进口，他们还把战略物资钨、锑、锡等大量私运出口。
    这里先说一说他们的盗窃勾当。这个问题分两方面来说：即盗窃国家经济情报和盗窃物资。
    贺衡夫大盗窃集团利用他们的爪牙及贺衡夫的职位的方便，曾经盗窃了国家的重要经济情报。贺衡夫于一九五零年九月二十六日参加中南财政经济委员会第二次委员会时，盗窃到手的经济情报有：中南粮食产销情况及调剂办法（并附有粮食产销参考材料十二份），关于公私企业领导问题的指示，中南区一九五零年合作工作计划纲要，中南区纺织、卷烟、煤炭、火柴、榨油五大生产事业概况及一九五零年下半年产销计划，调整工商业公私关系的参考资料等等重要文件和参考资料十七种。这些文件是发给出席会议的委员们准备讨论意见的，规定要第二天交回。奸商贺衡夫把这些文件带回工商联去，要二十多个职员一夜抄下来。一九五一年二月九日下午二时，中南财经委员会举行第三十五次委务会议，农林部朱江户副部长报告中南一九五零年林业总结一九五一年林业生产计划的文件，也被贺衡夫偷去了，他送给汉阳竹木商传阅，便于他们进行投机活动，使湖南等地国家林业受到重大损失。
    人民政府为了粉碎美帝国主义的“经济封锁”，曾计划采取“以货易货”政策。在公布之前，贺衡夫就从许锺毅那里获得了这项情报。他一面派专人把这个情报及易货详细项目送往香港，以便使美帝国主义立即对我加紧“封锁”；一面又在国内市场大肆造谣诋毁，称这一办法为“死办法”。当时奸商们正有一批桐油要想出口，他们就叫嚣限制桐油出口为“桐油悬案”。后来允准出口，“国家财产损失达八十亿元”（李景文自供）。
    武汉对外贸易管理局副局长许锺毅等加入盗窃集团后，这个局实际上就被篡夺了。中央及中南拟议中尚未公布的某些重要经济情报均由许锺毅供给奸商，这个盗窃集团中的刘心如可以随时到倪同甲那里看秘密的国际经济情报，并且可以抄写带回。
    一九五一年贺衡夫在中南财委参加会议时，得到中国人民银行中南区行一九五一年的贷款计划的经济情报以后，就组织他的盗窃集团向国家银行积极进攻。其中仅乾昌一家，一九五一年就从中国银行得到贷款二百四十多亿元。贺衡夫除了利用经济情报组织进攻外，并且结合他的坐探陈安性、柯云程的奸细活动，得到贷款特别方便的机会。例如他押款的桐油大都是空桶，只在周围用些装了桐油的桶打打掩护，贷款就可以骗到手里。
    现在再说他们盗窃国家资财——桐油的部分。贺衡夫盗窃集团在解放前后盗窃的桐油，根据检举材料初步统计，即达五十二万六千七百担以上；按每担五十四万元计，共值人民币二千八百四十四亿一千八百万元。这五十几万担桐油中，约有三十五万担是伪中国植物油料厂的敌产。当一九四八年淮海战役捷报频传的时候，伪中国植物油料厂分散在武汉市民生、三北、招商局各公司仓库趸船上的，以及存放在各家油行和三十只民船上的存油，眼看就要归人民所有。贺衡夫在一九四九年一月的奸商秘密会议上说：“这些物资是我们的。共产党是我们的敌人，我们不能留一点给他们。”于是，他们以如下的方法把存油盗运一空：一、伪中国植物油料厂向各油行所购存的桐油，直接由各家油行运走；二、各家油行以买廉价油的名义，直接到伪中国植物油料厂下油，或者把伪中国植物油料厂由各产地来的油，直接在河下改换唛头过驳运走；三、来不及抢运的，即以各家油行名义分散存放，解放后陆续装运出口。
    解放后，这一盗窃集团胆大包天地盗窃中南油脂公司和湖北省贸易公司（先是土产公司）的桐油。他们盗窃的方法有这样几种：一、把公家存油私运出口，作为他们的资金周转。二、抢夺。如一九五零年十月，油脂公司在其昌油行存油五千三百担，贺衡夫指示其昌行奸商朱显元，勾结贪污分子汤舜耕，趁油脂公司大批油脂涌到的机会，采用“赶马混骡子”的办法，干脆把其昌的这笔仓单圈销完事，这批桐油就成了奸商的财产，改换唛头，运出国外。又如，一九五零年六月初，湖北省贸易公司由产地到有木船二十多只，共装桐油二千七百余铁桶（十万零二千六百担），计二十车。当时贺衡夫集团派出大批人员，两天功夫，就把这批油中的十车刷成“华年”唛头，把十车刷成“义瑞”唛头，各样手续齐备，几天后就把这批油交给长城、粤汉渝两家运输行，运到天津转口运往香港。三、串通内奸，以坏货充好货，盗窃加工油，以坏油作好油的样品，使公家不要便于收购。
    这个盗窃集团所有一切出口货物应办的货物证件，全是由内奸伪造包办的。盗窃集团重要分子李景文、刘心如伙同派进对外贸易管理局的坐探倪同甲和被拉过去的陈锺毅，盗出了这个局盖了印的空白进出口许可证正本一百张，分给各家油行。汉口中国银行的图章由陈安性盖好，用时自行填写。税务局内被拉过去的贪污分子薛吉罡、熊惠群负责供给假发票、动向书和空白税票，要用就填。税票上所需要的人民银行收款图章，他们把图章样式寄到香港，在香港照刻一个带回存放在薛吉罡、熊惠群手里。运输由粤汉长运输行奸商汪柏青包办。广州出口深圳方面海关由广州义瑞行负责，在香港方面勾结了检验人员。这个盗窃集团的严密组织，使所有盗窃走私物资出进通行无阻。
    他们除了盗窃桐油之外，还曾盗窃棉纱、棉花、棉布等物资，数目也很惊人，这里不再详举。至于其他物资私运出口的也很多，如土产中的五棓子、木耳、猪鬃、牛羊皮、生漆、豆饼、苎麻、白木耳、豆油、生仁、麻袋、芝麻、茶油、香油、菜油、皮油等，贵重药材如当归、麝香、伏苓、大黄等，再如军用物资水银、钨、锑、樟脑油、机油、汽油、铁桶等。
    四、走私黄金贩卖毒品
    贺衡夫大盗窃集团所盗窃的物资数量是惊人的，而他们走私黄金出口，贩卖毒品，为害的严重性和数量的巨大，更要惊人。
    贺衡夫大盗窃集团在走私贩毒方面，曾经大量私运黄金、白洋、美钞、金钢钻、白金出口，贩入烟土、海洛因、吗啡、白面、红丸等毒品。他们在桐油桶里装入黄金等出口，用奶粉、罐头等装进毒品来。他们进出口走私伪装的方式是说不完的。他们把这些违禁品放在桐油、药材、麸皮、生漆、芝麻、青豆、五棓子、包谷等物资内出口，也曾在打字机里装烟土进口，也有的放在颜料内、立德粉内甚至汽车胎内。有一次，他们在印度产地即以“高级保险粉”为伪装运入国内六万两吗啡。
    要统计他们私运黄金、毒品等出进口的数字，也是一件困难的事。据李景文的坦白，仅他所知者，解放后就贩运进口白面五十万两、鸦片三百五十万两，出口黄金三百万两；解放前进口的有鸦片四十八万两，白面六万五千两。据晋昌贸易行高级职员朱伯誉的检举，解放后偷运出口黄金八十六万两。
    在黄金出口、毒品进口的时候，这个盗窃集团的成员在香港、广州、汉口等地用一套密号联系，黄金的代号是“黄岑”，鸦片的代号是“油墨”，吗啡的代号是“奶粉”等等。
    奸商们贩卖大量的毒品伤害了多少善良的人民，是无法统计的。他们的这种滔天罪行，怎能不引起全中国爱国人民的义愤！
    五、必须彻底制裁
    以上所说的贺衡夫走私贩毒大盗窃集团的罪恶，还仅仅是全部案情的一小部分。对于贺衡夫盗窃案的控诉，正如有些工人店员所说的：“三天三夜也说不完。”武汉市七家油行联合举行的斗争大会，一连开了四天，但是检举还没有结束，还有六十多人要求检举。贺衡夫大盗窃案的破获，使我们增加了斗争经验，更进一步地认识了资产阶级的丑恶嘴脸，更进一步地认识了他们猖狂进攻的严重性和复杂性。武汉市参加“五反”运动的工作人员和工人店员们，有决心有信心弄清这一盗窃集团的全部案情，并且一定要很好地制裁这批奸商们。以贺衡夫为首的这一个走私贩毒盗窃集团，对共产党、工人阶级和人民政府的进攻是极其猖狂的极其严重的。他们把国家的人民的财产大量偷盗到香港、台湾、美国去，这些人已经不是简单的奸商，而是一伙凶恶的强盗，一批美帝国主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗！为了巩固工人阶级的领导权，为了保障革命胜利果实，我们全体爱国人民应该一致起来围攻大奸商，彻底肃清一切奸商的盗窃集团。
