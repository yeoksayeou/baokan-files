    Female Worker Li Xiuyun Creates Scientific Method for Operating Cone Winding Machine

    After promotion in the Cone Winding and Preparation Workshops, annual output and savings are equivalent to 700 tons of grain

    Li Xiuyun, a female cone winding machine worker at the Northeast Liaoyang Textile Factory, has created a relatively scientific method for operating the cone winding machine (the doffing work method). After the promotion of Li Xiuyun's work method in the Preparation and Cone Winding Workshops of this textile factory, the annual increase in production and savings is equivalent to the wealth of 700 tons of grain.

    Li Xiuyun is a young female worker, just turned eighteen this year. Although she has only been working in the cone winding workshop for a few years, she has made rapid progress because she is willing to study diligently and learn humbly. After mastering the scientific operation method, her output and tending capacity are 20 to 30 percent higher than the average worker, and the quality has always been 100% qualified; the most outstanding achievement is that each splicing end has an average waste of only 3/8 of an inch (generally more than 3 inches), and the average waste rate for five months is only 3/100,000.

    The biggest feature of Li Xiuyun's work method is using a two-finger cover for splicing, reducing yarn end consumption. In the past, some cone winding machine workers used their fingers to wrap the yarn when splicing yarn ends, resulting in a lot of yarn waste with each splice; even those who didn’t wrap with their fingers had yarn ends of 2 inches or more. Li Xiuyun's splicing method is to pinch the end of the yarn tightly against the scissor edge with the thumb and forefinger of her right hand, and only use her left hand to pull the yarn strip upwards when knotting, without moving her right hand. The cut yarn end is both short (2 to 3 fen [approximately 6-9mm]) and the knot is small and not easily loosened.

    Recently, Li Xiuyun has further enriched the content of the splicing method. When her right thumb and forefinger clamp the yarn end of the bobbin, she uses her thumb to press the yarn end and twist it towards the tip of her forefinger to compensate for the insufficient twist at the upper and lower yarn ends. At the same time, she changed the method of feeling for the yarn end on the cone yarn with her hand to looking for the yarn end with her eyes. While using her hand to splice the yarn end, she looks at the cone yarn rotating on the adjacent roller to find the yarn end. In this way, she overcomes the shortcomings of the time-consuming and quality-damaging method of touching the yarn end with her hand.

    The quality of cone yarn is closely related to whether the steel balls, magnetic bowls, yarn clearers, and reciprocating yarn guide magnetic teeth on the machine are clean and whether they are playing their due role. Therefore, she pays special attention to this link. Before each work session, she must first check the cleanliness of these parts, always keep these parts clean, and thoroughly implement the operation method of "every yarn passing through the yarn clearer and every steel ball being able to move." She also pays attention to the cleanliness of her working environment, keeping everything from the machine board to the floor clean, so that the cone yarn does not get dirty.

    Rational allocation of time and working with both hands alternately are also characteristics of Li Xiuyun's work method. The Liaoyang Textile Factory's cone winding machine workers adopt a straight-line patrol route for splicing yarn ends (because the yarn pushing cart travels on a single track). To avoid unnecessary travel, Li Xiuyun interweaves tasks such as splicing, sweeping the machine, doffing, and piecing when doffing, so as to avoid running empty. Li Xiuyun is also good at distinguishing the importance and urgency of tasks and adopting different work methods. For example, when she is about to finish splicing a row of yarn and finds a break in the middle or front, she does not immediately go back to splice it, but waits until she finishes splicing the row and pushes the cart back to splice another row, and then splices it conveniently to save time. For any operation, Li Xiuyun uses both hands alternately, and one action has several functions. For example, when she splices and hangs the yarn, she only needs to pull the yarn gently, which both hangs the yarn and embeds the yarn under the yarn clearer and steel ball. For example, when cleaning the steel ball, her right hand uses a tool to push the steel ball out of the magnetic bowl, and her left hand uses a rag to wipe the steel ball clean, and the tool in her right hand incidentally sweeps the magnetic bowl clean. Other operations such as doffing, piecing, and splicing are also performed in this way.

    After the Liaoyang Textile Factory's Cone Winding and Preparation Workshops promoted Li Xiuyun's work method, waste consumption was reduced. The average yarn end length in the cone winding workshop was reduced from 3 inches to 1/2 inch. From October of last year to February of this year, yarn end consumption was reduced by as much as 4 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 47 tons of grain. The average yarn end length in the preparation workshop was reduced from 5 inches to 3/4 inch. In five months, the reduced yarn end consumption reached more than 3 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 35 tons of grain. The entire factory can save 13 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 152 tons of grain, in a year just from reducing waste.

    Because Li Xiuyun's work method was promoted, the output and quality of yarn have also improved. The number of protruding and poorly formed cone yarns in the cone winding workshop was reduced from 5/10,000 to 2/10,000; the waste products such as worn and oil-stained yarn that were frequently found in the past have been completely eliminated. The losses caused by repairing damaged cone yarn have been reduced to a minimum. According to preliminary statistics, eliminating waste products alone can increase production and save 40 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 468 tons of grain, annually.

    Currently, the average tending capacity of the Liaoyang Textile Factory's cone winding workshop has increased by 10% compared to October, and the output has increased by 12%, saving 7 man-hours per day. If all employees in the workshop reach the standard of Li Xiuyun's work method, 20 man-hours can be saved per day.

    After the Cone Winding and Preparation Workshops promote Li Xiuyun's work method, they can increase production and save 60 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 700 tons of grain, annually in terms of reducing consumption, eliminating waste products, and saving expenses. (Peng Jianhua)

    东北辽阳纺织厂筒摇车间
    女工李秀云创造科学的筒子车操作法
    筒摇、准备两车间推广后，全年可增产节约七百吨粮食
    东北辽阳纺织厂筒子车女工李秀云，创造了一套比较科学的筒子车操作法（落纱的工作法）。这个纺织厂的准备车间和筒摇车间推广了李秀云的工作法以后，全年可增产节约相当于七百吨粮食的财富。
    李秀云是一个青年女工，今年刚满十八岁。她到筒摇车间工作虽没几年，但由于她肯苦心钻研，虚心学习，进步很快。她掌握了科学的操作法后，产量和看台能力要比一般工人高百分之二十到三十，质量一贯是百分之百合格；最突出的成绩是每个接头回丝平均只有八分之三吋（一般在三吋以上），五个月的平均回丝率只十万分之三。
    李秀云工作法的最大的特点是用二指盖接头，减少纱头消耗。过去筒子车工人接纱头，有些是用手指绕纱条，接一个头要出很多纱头；有的虽不用手指绕，但纱头也在二吋以上。李秀云的接头法，是用右手姆指和食指的指头捏住纱的头端紧贴于剪刀口上，打结时仅用左手持纱条往上抽，右手不动。割下的纱头既短（二分至三分），结头的疙瘩又小，还不容易松解。
    最近，李秀云又进一步充实了接头方法的内容。当她右手姆指和食指夹住管纱纱头的时候，用姆指压住纱头向食指尖处搓撚，以弥补上下两纱头处的撚度不足。同时，她把原在筒子纱上用手摸纱头的方法，改为用眼找纱头。一面用手接纱头，一面用眼瞧着邻近滚筒上回转的筒子纱，以发现纱头。这样，就克服了既费事又损伤质量用手摸纱头的方法的缺点。
    筒子纱质量的好坏，和机台上的钢球、磁碗、清纱板、往复导纱磁牙是否清洁和是否发挥了应有的作用有很大的关系。因此，她特别重视这一环。每次工作前，必先检查这些机件的清洁情况，经常保持这些机件的清洁，并彻底实行“每根纱通过清纱板，每个钢球都能跳动”的操作法。她也很注意自己工作环境的清洁，从车板到地上，都收拾得干干净净，使筒子纱不会弄脏。
    合理分配时间，双手交叉进行工作，也是李秀云工作法中的特点。辽阳纺织厂筒子车工人接纱头是采取直线巡回的路线（因为推纱车是在单轨上行走的），为避免跑冤枉路，在落纱时李秀云把接头、扫车、落纱、生头等工作都交叉着进行，以免跑空路。李秀云还善于分别工作的轻重缓急，采用不同的工作方法。如当她快接完一排纱时发现中间或前面有断头，就不马上回去接，待接完这排纱推车回去接另一排纱时再顺手接上，以节省时间。任何一项操作，李秀云都是用双手交叉进行，而且一个动作还附带几个作用。如接了头挂纱的时候，只须把纱轻轻往下拉一下，既挂了纱，又使纱嵌入了清纱板和钢球底下。又如清洁钢球的时候，右手用工具把钢球从磁碗眼里顶出来，左手用破布把钢球揩净，右手的工具顺便就扫清了磁碗。其他如落纱、生头、接头等操作也都是这样的。
    辽阳纺织厂的筒摇、准备两车间，推广了李秀云工作法后，回丝消耗便减少了。筒子间平均纱头长度由三吋减少到半吋，从去年十月到今年二月，纱头消耗减少达四件纱之多，相当于四十七吨粮食。准备车间平均纱头长度由五吋减低到四分之三吋，五个月来减少的纱头消耗达三件纱之多，合粮食三十五吨。全厂一年仅因减少回丝便可节约十三件纱，合粮食一百五十二吨。
    因为推广了李秀云工作法，纱的产量质量也提高了。筒子车间两侧冒出、成形不良的筒子纱，由万分之五降低为万分之二；过去经常发现的磨坏、油污等废品已经全部消灭。修理坏筒子纱所造成的损耗，减少到了最低限度。据初步统计：仅消灭废品全年就可增产节约四十件纱，合粮食四百六十八吨。
    目前，辽阳纺织厂筒摇车间的平均看台能力，较十月份提高了百分之十，产量提高了百分之十二，每天可以节省七个人工。全车间职工如果都达到李秀云工作法的标准，每天可节省二十个人工。
    筒摇、准备两车间推广李秀云工作法后，全年在减少消耗、消灭废品、节约开支上，便可增产节约六十件纱，合粮食七百吨。　（彭建华）
