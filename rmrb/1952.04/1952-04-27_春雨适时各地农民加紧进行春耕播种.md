Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Recently, most parts of the country have experienced continuous spring rains, and farmers in various regions are stepping up spring plowing and sowing. Since the 15th of this month, the Northeast region has experienced continuous rain and snow (snowfall in some northern areas). So far, except for the southwestern part of Liaoxi Province and the southern part of Rehe Province, where rainfall is relatively small, most areas of Liaodong, Songjiang, Jilin, and Rehe Provinces have received more than 10 millimeters of precipitation, with the maximum reaching 25 millimeters. The central part of Inner Mongolia has also experienced about 10 millimeters of snowfall. Most areas of the Yellow River basin have experienced widespread rainfall since the 22nd. Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi Provinces, and the western part of Henan Province, as well as the northwestern part of Shandong Province, have received more than 5 millimeters of rainfall. Shaanxi, Pingyuan, most parts of Henan Province, and the southwestern part of Hebei Province, as well as southeastern Gansu, have received 10 to 25 millimeters of rainfall. Ningxia, Qinghai, and the eastern and central parts of Hebei Province have not received rain. The provinces of the Southwest region experienced spring rains again between the 20th and 24th. Sichuan Province generally received 15 to 30 millimeters of rainfall; northwestern Xikang and most parts of Guizhou received more than 30 millimeters of rainfall; Yunnan Province received less rainfall, mostly less than 5 millimeters. Between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, rainfall generally did not exceed 25 millimeters. South of the Yangtze River, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, received varying amounts of rainfall ranging from 30 to 50 millimeters.

Currently, most parts of the north are carrying out spring sowing. The recent rains are very timely, ensuring smooth progress in spring sowing and benefiting wheat growth. In addition, insect pests such as wheat aphids and red spiders will also be reduced in some areas of Henan and Pingyuan Provinces. The Southwest region experienced spring drought and water shortage in the previous period, with paddy fields lacking water. The recent rains are particularly beneficial for the growth of seedlings and for preparing paddy fields for transplanting.

    春雨适时各地农民加紧进行春耕播种
    【新华社二十六日讯】近来全国大部地区连降春雨，各地农民正加紧进行春耕播种。东北区自本月十五日起连续不断地降落雨雪（北部部分地区落雪），到现在止，除辽西省西南部及热河省的南部地区雨量较小外，辽东、松江、吉林和热河省的大部地区降水量都在十公厘以上，最多地区达二十五公厘。内蒙中部地区亦降雪十公厘左右。黄河流域大部地区自二十二日起普遍降雨，绥远、察哈尔、山西三省及河南省的西部，山东省西北部降雨五公厘以上；陕西、平原、河南省的大部和河北省西南部、甘肃东南部降雨十至二十五公厘；宁夏、青海和河北省的东部、中部无雨。西南区各省二十日到二十四日间又降春雨。四川地区普遍获雨十五到三十公厘；西康西北部和贵州大部降雨三十公厘以上；云南省雨量较小，多不足五公厘。江淮之间一般降雨二十五公厘以下。长江以南湖南、江西、广东、广西、苏南、浙江、福建等地降雨三十到五十公厘不等。
    目前北方大部地区正在进行春播，最近的雨都很适时，春播可保顺利进行，并有益于小麦成长。此外河南、平原两省部分地区麦蚜虫和红蜘蛛等虫害也将减轻。西南地区前些时期春旱缺雨，稻田缺水。最近的雨对秧苗生长和整理稻田、准备插秧尤其有利。
