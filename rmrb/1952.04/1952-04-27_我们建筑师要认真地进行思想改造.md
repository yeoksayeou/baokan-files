We Architects Must Conscientiously Carry Out Ideological Remoulding
Dai Nianci, Architect

In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the problems exposed in our architectural field are extremely serious. We have seen many old construction companies regard cutting corners and using inferior materials as a “matter of course” business practice; many architectural firms and construction companies collude with each other, working hand in glove. Some even deliberately increase the cost in design to collect more design fees according to the percentage. In publicly owned construction institutions, the phenomena of corruption and embezzlement, as well as the damage and waste caused by irresponsible employment attitudes and the pursuit of formalism and the desire to showcase one's own masterpieces, are also shockingly great.

The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have dealt a heavy blow to these decadent things, thus enabling our architectural undertaking to develop and grow on this new foundation and effectively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. How should we architects improve our work on this new foundation? Judging from the problems exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the fundamental problem is still our ideological remoulding.

Last year, we raised the issue of opposing the "masterpiece" mentality and mercenary viewpoints among engineering and technical personnel. Thinking about it today, our understanding at that time was very superficial, and we did not truly calmly look at ourselves in the mirror, which caused us to continue to make a series of mistakes in our subsequent work. For example, in a project we handled last year, the reinforced concrete eaves alone cost 800 million yuan. And such eaves are actually something that is optional. Why use the people's hard-earned money to make something optional? At that time, I didn't think about it properly. In the past, when we did architectural design, we were not in the habit of considering these issues much. It was through the "Three-Anti" movement that we further realized that architectural workers are precisely the people who directly handle affairs and use money for the people. We should spend every penny of the people in important places, and this is the correct work attitude. Many of our comrades put forward the slogans "Careful calculation and prudent penmanship" and "Save what can be saved, and do without what is dispensable" in this movement. I think such slogans are one of the concrete methods for our design workers to save for the country and the people.

In addition to saving, we must also actively increase production. The work of the past two years has made us deeply feel that the workload the people have placed on the shoulders of us architectural designers is far beyond our capacity. And in the upcoming high tide of economic construction, the problem of insufficient productivity will inevitably become more serious. If this problem is not solved, our economic construction cannot advance by leaps and bounds. There are ways to solve this problem. Our leading organs have long pointed out the direction of "standardized" design. In this way, a lot of design work can be saved. However, people like me who perform specific technical work cannot accept this new thing. Initially, I thought that "standardization" was a product of mechanized mass production; at present, on our backward industrial basis, there is no point in talking about "standardization," and the effectiveness of "standardization" cannot be brought into play. Later, although I realized that we should actively improve architectural work to solve the basic construction problems that industry urgently needs to solve, and should not wait for industry to develop before talking about the "standardization" of architecture; however, when we encounter actual work, we again emphasize that each building has its specific and special circumstances, and use this reason to oppose standardization. Therefore, although leading comrades have repeatedly pointed out this direction for two years, we have never solved this problem. In fact, is it impossible for handicraft production to be "standardized"? Can "standardization" not solve the particularity of each building? The answer should be "yes." Our old Chinese architecture in the past was "standardized." Both in terms of construction methods and layout, it had certain specifications and practices, and could adapt to various specific changes. The layout of the courtyard and the wooden frame structure of the columns can not only meet the needs of different families, but also adapt to various different sites and various different building scales. Due to the simplicity of the structure, the laws of this architectural technology are easily mastered by designers. I think the creativity of our working people in this area in the past is still the best reference for us today. (Of course, this is not to say that today's buildings should also be column frames and courtyard layouts.)

The main obstacle to the standardization of building design is not objective difficulties, but the ideological problems of our engineering design personnel. Technical workers in the old society often overly believed in themselves and always held a skeptical attitude towards the work results of others; they believed that it was best to do any design work from beginning to end by themselves. They only allow others to do according to their ideas, but are unwilling to design according to the specifications set by others. These are the main obstacles to "standardization."

The "Three-Anti" movement has improved our understanding. We recognize the importance of increasing production and practicing economy in the construction of a new democratic society. But more importantly, how to truly achieve increased production and practice economy in future work. The problem is recognized, but when we do it, our specific actions often run counter to our understanding. This is because we have not firmly established our stand on the working class, and old ideological consciousness often prevails. For example, although I myself recognized the harm of the "masterpiece" mentality and mercenary viewpoints last year, I still repeatedly made many mistakes in subsequent work. Although I recognized the importance of "standardization," I did not achieve "standardization" in my actual work. This is all the result of being too deeply poisoned by bourgeois individualism and not working hard enough in ideological remoulding.

Therefore, I feel that the problem of increasing production and practicing economy in front of architects is not only a question of how to use more brains to think of methods technically, but also a question of resolutely and continuously transforming ourselves ideologically and arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

    我们建筑师要认真地进行思想改造
    正建筑师  戴念慈
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们建筑事业中所暴露出的问题，是极其严重的。我们看到很多旧的营造厂把偷工减料当作“理所当然”的经营方法；很多建筑师事务所和营造厂勾勾搭搭，狼狈为奸，有些人甚至在设计上故意提高造价，以便按照“成”数多收设计费。在公营的建筑机构里，贪污盗卖的现象，以及由于不负责任的雇佣观点和追求形式、表现自己的杰作思想所造成的损害和浪费，也是大得惊人的。
    “三反”和“五反”运动给这些腐朽的东西以一个狠狠的打击，因而使我们的建筑事业可以在这个新的基础上发展壮大，有效地开展增产节约运动。我们建筑师应当怎样在这个新基础上改进我们的工作呢？从“三反”、“五反”运动中暴露出来的问题看，根本问题还是我们的思想改造问题。
    去年我们曾提出了反对工程技术人员中的杰作思想和雇佣观点的问题。今天想来，当时的认识是很肤浅的，并没有真正平心静气地拿镜子来照一照自己，因而使自己在以后的工作中，仍旧犯了一连串的错误。例如去年我们经手设计的一个工程，光是钢骨水泥挑檐一项就费了八亿元。而这样的挑檐，其实是可要可不要的东西。为什么把人民的血汗钱拿来做一个可要可不要的东西呢？当时自己竟没有好好地想过。过去我们做建筑设计时，习惯上从来是不大盘算这些问题的。通过了“三反”运动，才使我们进一步认识到，建筑工作者正是直接经手给人民办事用钱的人。应当把人民的每一个钱都化在要紧地方，这才是正确的工作态度。我们很多同志在这次运动中提出了“精打细算，谨慎下笔”、
    “可省可不省的要省，可要可不要的不要”的口号。这样的口号，我以为正是我们设计工作者为国家人民节约的具体方法之一。
    除了节约之外，我们还要积极地增产。两年来的工作，使我们深深地感到人民摆在我们建筑设计工作者肩膀上的工作分量，是远远超过了我们的承受能力的。而在今后经济建设的高潮中，这个生产力不够的问题，必然会更加严重。不解决这个问题，我们的经济建设就不可能大踏步地前进。解决这个问题的办法是有的。我们的领导机关早就指出了“规格化”的设计方向。这样，就能节省很多设计工作。但是，像我这样执行具体技术工作的人，却总不能接受这个新鲜的事物。最初，我认为“规格化”是机械化大生产的产物；在目前我们落后的工业基础上，谈不到“规格化”的问题，也发挥不出“规格化”的效能来。后来，我虽然认识到我们应当主动地改进建筑工作以解决工业迫切需要解决的基本建设问题，而不应当等待工业发达以后，再来谈建筑的“规格化”问题；但是，一碰到实际的工作，我们就又强调每幢房屋都有他的具体的特殊情况，用这个理由来反对规格化。因此，两年来虽然领导同志一再指出这个方向，而我们竟始终没有解决这个问题。其实，是不是手工业生产就不可能“规格化”呢？是不是“规格化”不能解决每幢房屋的特殊性呢？答案应当是“能够的”。我们中国过去的旧式建筑就是“规格化”的。它不论在构造方法和平面配置上，都是既有一定的规格做法，又能适应各种不同的具体变化。四合院的布置形式和立柱的木架结构不但能适应不同家庭的需要，也能适应各种不同基地和各种不同的建筑规模。由于构造的简单，这种建筑技术上的规律，便很容易被设计者所掌握。过去我国劳动人民在这方面的创造，我想还是我们今天最好的借鉴。（当然，这并不是说，今天的建筑也应该是立柱构架和四合院的布置形式。）
    建筑物设计规格化的主要障碍并不是客观困难，而是我们工程设计人员的思想毛病。旧社会的技术工作者们常常过分地相信自己，对别人的工作成果总是抱着怀疑的态度；认为任何设计工作最好是自己一手做到底。只允许别人照我的意思做，而不愿意遵照别人定出的规格来设计。这些就是“规格化”的主要障碍。
    “三反”运动提高了我们的认识。我们认识了增产节约在新民主主义社会建设中的重要性。但是，更重要的，是今后在工作中怎样真正做到增产节约。问题认识了，但是做的时候，我们的具体行动往往还是会和自己的认识背道而驰。这是因为我们还没有坚定地站稳工人阶级的立场，旧的思想意识还常常占上风的缘故。例如我自己去年虽然认识到杰作思想和雇佣观点的危害性，但在以后工作中仍旧重复地犯了很多错误。虽然认识了“规格化”的重要性，但在实际工作中却没有做到“规格化”。这都是由于我受资产阶级个人主义的毒害太深，在思想改造方面努力不够所造成的结果。
    因此，我觉得建筑师面前的增产节约问题，不仅是技术上如何多动脑筋想办法的问题，而且是坚决地、不断地从思想上改造自己，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装自己的问题。
