Xinhua News Agency, April 7th:

    Mei Ru'ao, Chinese international law expert and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, after participating in the Northeast branch of the "Investigation Team on U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes," wrote an open letter to the judges from the ten countries of the former International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He informed them of the shocking and unprecedented germ warfare crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the peaceful people of Northeast China, which he personally investigated and fully confirmed. He also urged them to uphold justice and unanimously condemn this crime. Mei Ru'ao's original letter is as follows: To Sir William Webb of the Australian Supreme Court; General Cramer, former Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army; General Chaiyanov of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union; Lord Patrick of the Scottish Court of Session of the United Kingdom; Mr. McDougall of the Quebec Court of King's Bench of Canada; Mr. Bernard of the University of Paris, France; Professor Röling of the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; Mr. Northcroft of the Supreme Court of New Zealand; Professor Basu of the University of Calcutta, India; Mr. Hananlinla, former Minister of Justice of the Philippines; dear friends:
    "Time flies like an arrow" is an ancient Chinese proverb describing how quickly time passes. It has been more than three years since the end of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and our hurried farewell in Tokyo. I am very sorry that I have not communicated with you in these three years, although I have always missed and cared about the health and careers of each of you.
    But now I must write this letter to you because I want to report to you a shocking and unprecedented crime against international conventions that has recently occurred in this part of the world. That is: The U.S. military not only used bacteriological weapons prohibited by international law on the Korean battlefield, but also continuously dispatched a large number of military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace, and spread a large number of insects carrying infectious viruses in many urban and rural areas of Northeast China, attempting to massacre the peaceful residents of our country on a large scale! From February 29th to March 21st alone, the U.S. military dispatched as many as 175 batches and 955 sorties of military aircraft for the purpose of carrying out this atrocity! This crime is still being intensified.
    What a serious crime it is to use a large number of military aircraft to invade the airspace of a peaceful country and use bacteriological weapons on a large scale against its peaceful residents! The severity of this crime is unparalleled by any atrocity heard by the Nuremberg and International Military Tribunals for the Far East!
    You must have seen some reports about the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons in the newspapers. You may have accepted these reports with skepticism. You may think that the so-called "civilized" U.S. military would not actually degenerate to this point!
    I live in Beijing, and I naturally have a more accurate understanding of what is happening in this part of the world than you do. However, in order to thoroughly clarify this issue, I personally participated in an investigation team composed of many well-known medical scientists, entomologists, bacteriologists, and representatives of several social organizations, religious organizations, and women's organizations. From March 15th, we conducted a half-month on-the-spot investigation in various parts of Northeast China, especially in areas near the Yalu River (where U.S. aircraft invaded the most). I returned to Beijing on April 2nd.
    In this half-month of on-the-spot investigation, we listened to countless witness reports, obtained a large number of exhibits, and fully confirmed that U.S. military aircraft spread various types of insects carrying disease-causing germs over a vast area of Northeast China, attempting to kill Chinese peaceful residents on a large scale and destroy their livestock and crops. The insects spread by the U.S. military included flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, spiders, and springtails. These insects contained anthrax bacilli, Pasteurella, typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli, and other toxic bacteria or viruses that can cause diseases such as typhus and acute encephalitis.
    In this letter, I cannot report to you in as much detail as possible the results of the on-the-spot investigation over the past half month. Our report has been submitted to the Xinhua News Agency for publication on April 4th. After the Western translation is published, I will send a copy to each of you. However, here, I can solemnly and responsibly tell you: It is a true fact that the United States is conducting bacteriological warfare against the peaceful people of China, and this bacteriological warfare is being carried out continuously, on a large scale, and in a planned manner.
    What I saw and heard during the on-the-spot investigation fully confirmed this fact. The empty denials and cunning cover-ups of Acheson, Ridgway, and others are in vain. If an international tribunal is organized in the future to try the war criminals who conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, I am willing to appear before the court as a witness.
    Admittedly, due to the high vigilance of the Chinese people and government and the active efforts of air defense and epidemic prevention personnel, the bacteriological warfare carried out by the U.S. aggressors has not achieved the results they expected. On the contrary, the Chinese people have full confidence that they can defeat the "bacterial offensive" of the U.S. bacteriological war criminals. But this does not exonerate or mitigate the extreme seriousness of the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors.
    You all know that the use of bacteriological weapons on the battlefield is illegal. This is explicitly stipulated in international conventions and is the most basic rule of combat in international law that is recognized and observed by all civilized people in the world. The United States' continuous use of this weapon in the Korean War constitutes a very blatant violation of this rule of combat. However, the bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. military aircraft invading Chinese airspace against Chinese peaceful residents not only constitutes a crime of violating the rules of combat; it also constitutes the most serious "crime of aggression" because it is an open and direct violation of China's airspace sovereignty. At the same time, because it is aimed at the massacre of peaceful residents in the rear urban and rural areas, it also constitutes the most heinous "crime against humanity." This action by the U.S. military violates each of the three types of war crimes recognized in current international law and stipulated in the Nuremberg and International Military Tribunal for the Far East statutes, namely, all war crimes.
    You are all legal experts with deep knowledge. I don't need to elaborate on the extreme seriousness of this criminal act of the United States in international law. I believe that all honest and kind people in the world will feel indignant and will rise up to condemn it after understanding the truth of this fact.
    Dear friends, during that long, two-and-a-half-year Tokyo trial, I was able to spend time with you day and night and work together. That is a page in my life that is worth remembering and cherishing. I remember that we spent more than half a year listening to the statements and accusations about the various atrocities of the Japanese war criminals. We all felt infinite indignation at the bloody crimes of the Japanese war criminals who exterminated humanity, such as the Nanjing Massacre and the "Bataan Death March." Both in the courtroom and in the lounge, there was a spirit of hating evil like an enemy. Although the overall handling of the Japanese war criminals was not satisfactory due to the shielding of the U.S. reactionaries, this was not our responsibility. As far as I can remember, we have never easily relaxed our efforts against the bloody atrocities of those Japanese Class A war criminals who were tried in our court.
    However, dear friends, based on the various facts that I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I can solemnly tell you: The magnitude of the evil of the bacteriological warfare now being waged by the U.S. aggressors against the peaceful people of China is even greater than the atrocities of the Japanese war criminals in those years.
    Bacteria are not only capable of being used against one country. If we cannot effectively stop the U.S. crime of spreading germs now, and cannot eradicate this inhuman and terrifying scourge; then, the disaster that has befallen the Chinese people today will also befall the people of other countries in the world in the future. This will mean the negation of all international law and the catastrophe of human civilization. This is absolutely intolerable to all people who love justice and peace in the world.
    Dear friends, although our duties at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East have long been relieved, as legal workers, we should not stand idly by and ignore this unbridled criminal act of the U.S. aggressors in violating humanity and destroying the most basic principles of international law. This is why I am so eager to write to you.
    I know that you are all people with prestige and significant influence in the legal and judicial circles of your country. In order to save the catastrophe of human civilization and to uphold international justice and the dignity of the law, I earnestly hope that you will do everything in your power to unite all legal workers and all peace-loving and justice-seeking people in your country to jointly oppose and stop this appalling and unprecedented heinous crime of bacteriological warfare and massacre committed by the U.S. aggressors.
    With best regards!
                            Mei Ru'ao April 5, 1952

    梅汝璈致函前远东国际军事法庭各国法官
    控告美军在我东北撒布细菌罪行
    【新华社七日讯】我国国际法学家、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈博士，参加“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团归来后，写了一封公开信给前远东国际军事法庭十个国家的法官，把他亲自参加调查而完全证实了的美帝国主义对我东北和平人民所犯的骇人听闻和史无前例的细菌战罪行告诉他们，并敦促他们主持正义，一致声讨这一罪行。梅汝璈的原函如下：澳大利亚最高法院威廉·韦勃爵士；美国陆军部前军法总监克莱墨将军；苏联最高法院军事庭柴阳诺夫将军；联合王国苏格兰皇家法院派特里克勋爵；加拿大魁柏克皇家刑事法庭麦克杜哥先生；法国巴黎大学柏尔纳先生；荷兰乌特来特大学罗林教授；纽西兰最高法院诺斯克罗夫特先生；印度加尔加塔大学巴鲁教授；菲律宾前司法部长哈那林拉先生；亲爱的朋友们：
    “光阴似箭”是中国人形容时间过得快的古谚。自从远东国际军事法庭结束、我们在东京匆匆分别以后，到现在已经是三年多了。我很抱歉，在这三年多里没有给你们通过音讯，虽然我对你们每一个人的健康和事业都无时不在怀念和关切。
    但是现在我却要给你们写这一封信，因为我要向你们报道在地球上我们这一部分最近发生的一件骇人听闻和史无前例的违反国际公约的罪行。这便是：美国军队不但在朝鲜战场上使用了国际法所禁止的细菌武器，而且连续不断地派遣了大批军用飞机侵入中国领空，在我国东北许多城乡地区大量撒布带有传染病毒菌的昆虫，企图大规模地屠杀我国和平居民；仅自二月二十九日起至三月二十一日止，美国出动的以执行这种暴行为目的的军用飞机便有一百七十五批、九百五十五架次之多！这种罪行现在仍在变本加厉地进行着。
    用大批军用飞机侵入一个和平国家的领空，对它的和平居民大规模地使用细菌武器，这是多么严重的犯罪行为！这种犯罪的严重性是纽伦堡和远东国际军事法庭所听取过的任何暴行所不能比拟的！
    你们必定在报纸上看见过一些关于美军使用细菌武器的报道。你们或许是以半信半疑的心情来接受这些报道。你们也许会认为自称为“文明”的美国军队或不至于居然堕落到这个地步！
    我住在北京，对这部分地球上所发生的事情，见闻当然要比你们真切一些。但是，为了要彻底搞清楚这个问题，我亲自参加了一个由许多著名的医学家、昆虫学家、细菌学家、以及若干社会团体、宗教团体和妇女团体的代表们所组成的调查团，自三月十五日起在东北各地，特别是邻近鸭绿江一带（美国飞机侵入最多的地方），作了半个月的实地调查。我是四月二日回到北京来的。
    在这半个月的实地调查中，我们听取了无数的证人的报告，获得了大量的证物，完全证实了美国军用飞机在我国东北广大地区上撒布了各类的带有传播病菌的昆虫，企图大规模地杀害中国和平居民，并毁灭他们的家畜和农作物。美军所撒布的昆虫中以苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、虱子、蜘蛛、黑跳虫为最多；这些昆虫所含带的病菌有炭疽杆菌、巴士德属杆菌、伤寒和副伤寒杆菌、以及其他可以产生斑疹伤寒、急性脑炎等类病症的毒菌或病毒。
    在这封信里，我不能把这半个月来实地调查所得尽量地详细地报告你们。我们的报告书已经于四月四日交由新华通讯社公布，西文译本出版后，我将给你们每个人寄送一份。但是，在这里，我可以郑重地负责地告诉你们：美国对中国和平人民进行了细菌战是千真万确的事实，而且这种细菌战是连续地、大规模地、有计划地进行着的。
    我在实地调查中所见所闻，完全证实了这个事实。艾奇逊、李奇微之流的空言抵赖和狡黠掩饰是徒然的。假使异日组织一个国际法庭来审讯此次在朝鲜和我国的东北进行细菌战的战犯，我愿意以一个证人的资格出现于法庭之前。
    诚然，由于中国人民及政府的高度警惕和防空防疫工作人员的积极努力，美国侵略者所进行的细菌战并没有获得他们所预期的效果。相反地，中国人民有充分信心可以击败美国细菌战犯们的“细菌攻势”。但这并不能解脱或减轻美国侵略者所犯罪行的极端严重性。
    你们都知道，在战场上使用细菌武器是违法的。这是国际公约所明文规定和全世界文明人类所公认和共守的国际法上的最基本的作战规则。美国在朝鲜战争中不断地使用这种武器，构成了十分粗暴地破坏这一作战规则的罪行。但是美国军用飞机侵入中国领空对中国和平居民所进行的细菌战，则不仅犯了破坏作战规则罪；同时还犯了最严重的“侵略罪”，因为它是公开直接地侵犯了中国的领空主权。同时，由于它是以对后方城乡和平居民的屠杀为目的的，它又构成了最深重的“违反人道罪”。美国军队的这一行动，违犯了现在国际法上所承认、纽伦堡和远东国际军事法庭法规所规定的三种战罪中的每一种，亦即战争犯罪的全部。
    你们都是素养极深的法学专家，对于美国这种犯罪行为在国际法上的极端严重性，不用我多作阐述。我相信全世界正直善良的人民，在明了这个事实的真相之后，都会感觉愤慨、都会起来声讨。
    亲爱的朋友们，在那漫长的、两年半的东京审判中，我能和你们朝夕相处、通力合作，那是我生命史上值得回忆和珍视的一页。记得我们曾经花过半年以上的时光，专事听取关于日本战犯们种种暴行的陈述和控诉。对于灭绝人性的日本战犯们的血腥罪行，如南京大屠杀、“巴丹死亡进军”之类，我们当时莫不感觉无限的愤慨。无论在法庭上或休息室里，都充满了疾恶如仇的精神。虽然由于美国反动派的包庇，日本战犯的全般处理并不令人满意，但这并不是我们的责任。据我的记忆所及，对于那些在我们法庭受审的日本甲级战犯们的血腥暴行，我们始终没有轻易放松过。
    但是，亲爱的朋友们，我可以根据我亲眼所见、亲耳所闻的种种事实，严肃地告诉你们：现在美国侵略者对中国和平人民进行的细菌战，其罪恶之大，较之当年日本战犯们的暴行是有过之无不及的。
    细菌不是只对那一国才能使用的。倘使我们不能有效地制止美国现在撒布细菌罪行，不能根绝这种灭绝人性的恐怖祸害；那末，今日落在中国人民身上的灾难，他日也会落到世界其他国家人民的身上。这将意味着全部国际法的否定和人类文明的浩劫。这是全世界爱好正义和平的人民所绝对不能容许的。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们的远东国际军事法庭的职务虽早已解除，但是作为法律工作者，我们对于美国侵略者这样肆无忌惮地违反人道和破坏国际法最基本原则的犯罪行为，则不应袖手旁观、置之不理。这便是我急于要写信给你们的原因。
    我知道你们都是在你们国内法学界和司法界负有声望和重大影响的人士。为了挽救人类文明的浩劫和维护国际正义及法律的尊严，我热烈地盼望你们尽一切的能事，联合你们国家内所有的法律工作者和一切爱好和平正义的人们，一致起来对美国侵略者进行细菌战争和屠杀的这个骇人听闻、史无前例的滔天罪行，予以反对和制止。此致敬礼！
                            梅汝璈  一九五二年四月五日
