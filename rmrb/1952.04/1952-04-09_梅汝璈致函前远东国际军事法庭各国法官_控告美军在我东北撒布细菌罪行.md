Xinhua News Agency, April 7th:

    Mei Ru'ao, Chinese international law expert and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, after participating in the Northeast branch of the "Investigation Team on U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes," wrote an open letter to the judges from the ten countries of the former International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He informed them of the shocking and unprecedented germ warfare crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the peaceful people of Northeast China, which he personally investigated and fully confirmed. He also urged them to uphold justice and unanimously condemn this crime. Mei Ru'ao's original letter is as follows: To Sir William Webb of the Australian Supreme Court; General Cramer, former Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army; General Chaiyanov of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union; Lord Patrick of the Scottish Court of Session of the United Kingdom; Mr. McDougall of the Quebec Court of King's Bench of Canada; Mr. Bernard of the University of Paris, France; Professor RÃ¶ling of the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; Mr. Northcroft of the Supreme Court of New Zealand; Professor Basu of the University of Calcutta, India; Mr. Hananlinla, former Minister of Justice of the Philippines; dear friends:
    "Time flies like an arrow" is an ancient Chinese proverb describing how quickly time passes. It has been more than three years since the end of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and our hurried farewell in Tokyo. I am very sorry that I have not communicated with you in these three years, although I have always missed and cared about the health and careers of each of you.
    But now I must write this letter to you because I want to report to you a shocking and unprecedented crime against international conventions that has recently occurred in this part of the world. That is: The U.S. military not only used bacteriological weapons prohibited by international law on the Korean battlefield, but also continuously dispatched a large number of military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace, and spread a large number of insects carrying infectious viruses in many urban and rural areas of Northeast China, attempting to massacre the peaceful residents of our country on a large scale! From February 29th to March 21st alone, the U.S. military dispatched as many as 175 batches and 955 sorties of military aircraft for the purpose of carrying out this atrocity! This crime is still being intensified.
    What a serious crime it is to use a large number of military aircraft to invade the airspace of a peaceful country and use bacteriological weapons on a large scale against its peaceful residents! The severity of this crime is unparalleled by any atrocity heard by the Nuremberg and International Military Tribunals for the Far East!
    You must have seen some reports about the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons in the newspapers. You may have accepted these reports with skepticism. You may think that the so-called "civilized" U.S. military would not actually degenerate to this point!
    I live in Beijing, and I naturally have a more accurate understanding of what is happening in this part of the world than you do. However, in order to thoroughly clarify this issue, I personally participated in an investigation team composed of many well-known medical scientists, entomologists, bacteriologists, and representatives of several social organizations, religious organizations, and women's organizations. From March 15th, we conducted a half-month on-the-spot investigation in various parts of Northeast China, especially in areas near the Yalu River (where U.S. aircraft invaded the most). I returned to Beijing on April 2nd.
    In this half-month of on-the-spot investigation, we listened to countless witness reports, obtained a large number of exhibits, and fully confirmed that U.S. military aircraft spread various types of insects carrying disease-causing germs over a vast area of Northeast China, attempting to kill Chinese peaceful residents on a large scale and destroy their livestock and crops. The insects spread by the U.S. military included flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, spiders, and springtails. These insects contained anthrax bacilli, Pasteurella, typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli, and other toxic bacteria or viruses that can cause diseases such as typhus and acute encephalitis.
    In this letter, I cannot report to you in as much detail as possible the results of the on-the-spot investigation over the past half month. Our report has been submitted to the Xinhua News Agency for publication on April 4th. After the Western translation is published, I will send a copy to each of you. However, here, I can solemnly and responsibly tell you: It is a true fact that the United States is conducting bacteriological warfare against the peaceful people of China, and this bacteriological warfare is being carried out continuously, on a large scale, and in a planned manner.
    What I saw and heard during the on-the-spot investigation fully confirmed this fact. The empty denials and cunning cover-ups of Acheson, Ridgway, and others are in vain. If an international tribunal is organized in the future to try the war criminals who conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, I am willing to appear before the court as a witness.
    Admittedly, due to the high vigilance of the Chinese people and government and the active efforts of air defense and epidemic prevention personnel, the bacteriological warfare carried out by the U.S. aggressors has not achieved the results they expected. On the contrary, the Chinese people have full confidence that they can defeat the "bacterial offensive" of the U.S. bacteriological war criminals. But this does not exonerate or mitigate the extreme seriousness of the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors.
    You all know that the use of bacteriological weapons on the battlefield is illegal. This is explicitly stipulated in international conventions and is the most basic rule of combat in international law that is recognized and observed by all civilized people in the world. The United States' continuous use of this weapon in the Korean War constitutes a very blatant violation of this rule of combat. However, the bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. military aircraft invading Chinese airspace against Chinese peaceful residents not only constitutes a crime of violating the rules of combat; it also constitutes the most serious "crime of aggression" because it is an open and direct violation of China's airspace sovereignty. At the same time, because it is aimed at the massacre of peaceful residents in the rear urban and rural areas, it also constitutes the most heinous "crime against humanity." This action by the U.S. military violates each of the three types of war crimes recognized in current international law and stipulated in the Nuremberg and International Military Tribunal for the Far East statutes, namely, all war crimes.
    You are all legal experts with deep knowledge. I don't need to elaborate on the extreme seriousness of this criminal act of the United States in international law. I believe that all honest and kind people in the world will feel indignant and will rise up to condemn it after understanding the truth of this fact.
    Dear friends, during that long, two-and-a-half-year Tokyo trial, I was able to spend time with you day and night and work together. That is a page in my life that is worth remembering and cherishing. I remember that we spent more than half a year listening to the statements and accusations about the various atrocities of the Japanese war criminals. We all felt infinite indignation at the bloody crimes of the Japanese war criminals who exterminated humanity, such as the Nanjing Massacre and the "Bataan Death March." Both in the courtroom and in the lounge, there was a spirit of hating evil like an enemy. Although the overall handling of the Japanese war criminals was not satisfactory due to the shielding of the U.S. reactionaries, this was not our responsibility. As far as I can remember, we have never easily relaxed our efforts against the bloody atrocities of those Japanese Class A war criminals who were tried in our court.
    However, dear friends, based on the various facts that I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I can solemnly tell you: The magnitude of the evil of the bacteriological warfare now being waged by the U.S. aggressors against the peaceful people of China is even greater than the atrocities of the Japanese war criminals in those years.
    Bacteria are not only capable of being used against one country. If we cannot effectively stop the U.S. crime of spreading germs now, and cannot eradicate this inhuman and terrifying scourge; then, the disaster that has befallen the Chinese people today will also befall the people of other countries in the world in the future. This will mean the negation of all international law and the catastrophe of human civilization. This is absolutely intolerable to all people who love justice and peace in the world.
    Dear friends, although our duties at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East have long been relieved, as legal workers, we should not stand idly by and ignore this unbridled criminal act of the U.S. aggressors in violating humanity and destroying the most basic principles of international law. This is why I am so eager to write to you.
    I know that you are all people with prestige and significant influence in the legal and judicial circles of your country. In order to save the catastrophe of human civilization and to uphold international justice and the dignity of the law, I earnestly hope that you will do everything in your power to unite all legal workers and all peace-loving and justice-seeking people in your country to jointly oppose and stop this appalling and unprecedented heinous crime of bacteriological warfare and massacre committed by the U.S. aggressors.
    With best regards!
                            Mei Ru'ao April 5, 1952
