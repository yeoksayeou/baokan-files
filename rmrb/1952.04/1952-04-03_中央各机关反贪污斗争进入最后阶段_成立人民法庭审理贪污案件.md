    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: The anti-corruption struggle in central government agencies has victoriously entered its final stage since April 1st. All agencies have established People's Courts according to regulations, and the mass anti-corruption struggle is about to gradually conclude. Personnel participating in the work of the People's Courts are now actively carrying out various preparations so as to quickly begin trials. The remaining majority of cadres will return to their work posts within days. In the next half-month, responsible cadres at all levels who did not conduct self-criticism at the beginning of the movement, or whose self-criticism was not deep enough, will continue to conduct self-criticism level by level.
    According to the instructions of the Central Commission for Economy and Thrift Examination, agencies must never relax their efforts against the very small number of corrupt elements who still refuse to confess, even if the mass anti-corruption movement ends. These corrupt elements will be gathered together by each agency and continue to be investigated. We will not stop until the case is thoroughly solved, no matter if it takes one or two years. All corrupt elements who have not yet confessed should face up to the resolute will of the People's Government to thoroughly eliminate corruption. If they do not quickly repent, they will inevitably be caught in the net of the people's law.
    Since the beginning of March, the central government agencies have conducted large-scale handling of corrupt elements based on the spirit of combining severity with leniency, which has resulted in even greater achievements in the anti-corruption struggle. Agencies have basically completed the handling of corrupt elements who embezzled less than 10 million yuan. Some agencies have also made typical examples of corrupt elements who embezzled more than 10 million yuan. In order to strive for lenient treatment, many corrupt elements who were previously obsessed with their errors confessed one after another, supplemented their statements, and reported the crimes of others. As a result, the vast majority of corruption problems have been solved one after another. The number of major corrupt elements with over 100 million yuan of embezzlement uncovered in March alone was almost equal to the total number of major corrupt elements uncovered in the past three months.
    In March, the agencies also carried out the work of recovering stolen goods while conducting the handling. According to the experience of various agencies at this stage, the most important link in the work of recovering stolen goods is to encourage corrupt elements to voluntarily return the stolen goods. This requires repeatedly explaining the policy of reducing punishment for returning stolen goods to corrupt elements, and they must understand that honestly returning stolen goods is a concrete proof of confession and repentance. In the central government agencies, the work of recovering stolen goods has been relatively smooth in all those where this work has been done relatively well.

    中央各机关反贪污斗争进入最后阶段
    成立人民法庭审理贪污案件
    【新华社二日讯】中央各机关的反贪污斗争自四月一日起，胜利地进入最后一个阶段。各机关都按照规定成立了人民法庭，群众性的反贪污斗争即将逐渐结束。参加人民法庭工作的人员，现正积极进行各项准备工作，以便迅速开始审理，其余大部分干部都将在日内回到业务岗位上去。在今后半个月内，各级负责干部在运动开始时没有来得及作检讨或检讨不够深刻的，将逐级继续进行检讨。
    根据中央节约检查委员会的指示，各机关对那些至今拒不坦白的极少数贪污分子，决不因群众性的反贪污运动结束而稍有放松。这些贪污分子将由各机关集中起来，继续予以追查，不论一年两年，不到彻底破案，决不休止。一切尚未坦白的贪污分子，应该正视人民政府彻底肃清贪污的坚决意志，如果他们还不迅速悔悟，必然逃不脱人民的法网。
    中央各机关自三月初开始根据严肃与宽大相结合的精神，对贪污分子进行大批处理，使反贪污斗争获得了更巨大成绩。各机关对贪污在一千万元以下的贪污分子，已基本上处理完毕。有些机关并对贪污一千万元以上的贪污分子作了典型处理。许多过去执迷不悟的贪污分子为了争取宽大处理，纷纷坦白、补充交代材料和检举别人的罪行。因此，绝大多数的贪污问题都已陆续破案。三月份一个月内清查出来的一亿元以上的大贪污分子人数，就几乎和过去三个月内清查出来的大贪污分子总数相等。
    三月间各机关在进行处理时，同时进行了追赃工作。根据这一阶段各机关的经验，追赃工作中最重要的一环是必须鼓励贪污分子自动退赃。这就必须向贪污分子反复说明退赃减罪的政策，必须使贪污分子了解：老实退赃是坦白悔过的具体证明。中央各机关中，凡是这一工作做得比较好的，追赃工作就比较顺利。
