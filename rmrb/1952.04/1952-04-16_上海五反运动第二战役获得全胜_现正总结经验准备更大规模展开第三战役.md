Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 15th: The second battle of Shanghai's campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence has achieved the expected great victory after twelve days of intense combat. As of April 12th, over 1,900 of the 2,000 key illegal industrial and commercial households scheduled for inspection had thoroughly confessed their problems. At the same time, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee quickly dealt with the problems of 10,000 small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households according to the classification standards and handling methods for illegal industrial and commercial households, initially forming a united front for the "Five-Anti" campaign.

Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign officially launched its second battle on April 1st. This battle, in addition to fully utilizing and continuing to enrich the experience of the first battle, more prominently created the brilliant example of "winning without fighting." According to the statistics of 1,900 illegal industrial and commercial households that have been completely solved, 1,000 were won without fighting, 500 collapsed at the first touch, and only about 400 went through fierce battles. In Huangpu District, out of 282 households, 209 were won without fighting. The main reasons for achieving this glorious victory are the deep understanding of the policies, the prestige of the "Five-Anti" victories in major cities across the country, the active participation of the broad masses in the struggle, and the complete victory achieved in the first battle. From the beginning, Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign emphasized policy propaganda and the mobilization of workers and shop assistants. After the start of the second battle, it continued to fully mobilize workers and shop assistants in private enterprises to participate in the "Five-Anti" struggle. During this period, workers and shop assistants in various districts widely organized "Five-Anti" committees and "Five-Anti" work teams by industry or region, actively mobilizing and leading the masses to participate in the movement. As of April 8th, according to incomplete statistics from 22 districts, the city had trained more than 25,000 grassroots trade union cadres and worker activists (including senior staff), established more than 1,000 "Five-Anti" committees, and 2,540 "Five-Anti" work teams, with more than 50,000 "Five-Anti" work team members. These cadres, activists, and "Five-Anti" work team members were the backbone of mobilizing the masses. They took the lead in complaining about their sufferings, exposing the illegal acts of unscrupulous capitalists, and ranking capitalists according to the classification standards for industrial and commercial households. Thousands of accusation and exposure meetings were held throughout the city, and 600,000 workers and shop assistants in private enterprises were drawn into the movement, forming the main force of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee organized 1,000 inspection teams that were well-versed in materials and good at accounting, and stood ready. They wouldn't enter factories and shops unless they were sure of breaking through. In the first battle, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee dispatched 74 inspection teams for key trials and achieved complete victory within ten days. As a result, the prestige of the inspection teams greatly increased. In the face of the 1,000 inspection teams in the second battle, the front lines of unscrupulous capitalists collapsed one after another, creating favorable conditions for "winning without fighting."

In the second battle of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign, illegal capitalists who had confessed and were willing to atone for their crimes participated in the battle. This was a new force in Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign, and it rapidly promoted the development of the movement. The Increase Production and Practice Economy Committees in various districts first allowed illegal capitalists who had thoroughly confessed in the first battle to "speak from experience" everywhere, telling about their own illegal acts, the process of confession, and the government's lenient treatment, in order to mobilize and persuade other unscrupulous capitalists to confess voluntarily and strive for the government's leniency. As a result of their "speaking from experience," many unscrupulous capitalists, awed by the power of the masses and moved by the government's policies, voluntarily confessed their problems. At the capitalists' confession and meritorious service conference held in Huangpu District, after reiterating the policies and letting the capitalists who confessed in the first battle speak from experience, more than 40 illegal industrial and commercial households expressed their willingness to confess voluntarily on the spot. After these illegal capitalists thoroughly confessed their problems, they were also absorbed into the "Five-Anti Meritorious Service Group" to mobilize other unscrupulous capitalists to confess. There are now more than 80 people participating in the meritorious service group in Huangpu District. The owner of Hengda Fire Engine Factory in Lao Zha District joined the "Meritorious Service Group" after confessing at the conference, and exposed the illegal acts of the owner of Taiping Fire Engine Factory. Gu Qingsheng, the owner of Huaxin Instrument & Stationery Factory, cooperated with the inspection team and workers and shop assistants to "persuade" the Science Instrument Hall, Zhili Instrument Company, and Keda Scientific Supplies Store to surrender in the second battle, enabling the inspection team to win in these three stores with one battle. Gu Qingsheng also mobilized the owners of these three stores to join the meritorious service group, and they planned to take on 30 scientific instrument stores in the third battle. The owner of Baosheng Rice Store, who was inspected, initially refused to confess, but after Wu Yuming, a peer, assisted the inspection team in checking the accounts and pointed out the key points, the owner of the factory supplemented the materials.

The second battle of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign also successfully uncovered the illegal acts of key illegal industrial and commercial households using the method of "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation." At the capitalists' meetings for inspection targets held in various districts, after the government reiterated the policies and explained the strength of the masses, many unscrupulous capitalists, awed by the prestige of the masses and moved by the government's policies, expressed their willingness to confess voluntarily and requested a postponement of the inspection. After the meeting, in addition to dispatching inspection teams to inspect a few illegal industrial and commercial households that refused to confess, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committees in various districts divided these capitalists who were willing to confess voluntarily into several groups, allowing them to report and evaluate each other. Among these capitalists, some, awed by the power of the masses and grateful for the government's leniency, confessed their problems relatively thoroughly from the beginning. Zhang Zhenyun, the owner of Xiangmao Factory in Yangshupu, said at the group meeting: Now that the government still calls for learning after committing a crime, it would be really ungrateful not to confess. Some people also tried to take advantage of the government's leniency to get away with it, but because the illegal capitalists who were willing to atone for their crimes were all experienced and insiders, those who wanted to deceive could not escape their eyes. At the mutual evaluation meeting of light industrial capitalists in Yulin District, the owner of Daye Printing Factory only confessed to some minor problems at the beginning. The owner of Dacheng Rubber Factory and the owner of 93 Shuttle Factory, who had thoroughly confessed, immediately pointed out that he was not honest, forcing the owner of Daye to supplement the materials. Zhou Hongquan, the captain of the real estate team in Huangpu District, pointed out that the owner of Xianghua Company was dishonest after confessing himself. He said: "I have been in the real estate business for decades, I know all about your business!" forcing the owner of Xianghua to confess all his problems. Therefore, through the mutual assistance and mutual evaluation of capitalists, the foundation for "winning without fighting" was expanded.

Another characteristic of the second battle of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign is that while solving the problems of key illegal industrial and commercial households, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee dispatched a large number of work groups to mobilize the masses and deal with the problems of 10,000 small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, quickly forming a united front for the "Five-Anti" campaign. The handling of small and medium-sized households was generally carried out in two aspects: on the one hand, convening meetings of bosses to explain the policies to them and calling on them to confess thoroughly in order to obtain the government's leniency; on the other hand, convening meetings of workers and shop assistants to call on them to rank the bosses according to the bosses' illegal acts and the classification standards for industrial and commercial households. Then, the work group and the workers and shop assistants verified the bosses' materials and reviewed them. If the materials were basically consistent, they were passed; if they were inconsistent, the bosses were asked to supplement them. After the materials were verified, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee convened a labor-capital conference to announce the decision. At the meeting, in addition to letting industrial and commercial households with more serious violations confess in public and being severely criticized by the masses, the rest were only given general criticism and encouraged to operate properly in the future and no longer oppress the workers. Then, a notice was issued. After this treatment, the workers and shop assistants were very satisfied. The workers and shop assistants of small and medium-sized households in Penglai District said: "The boss's affairs must be reviewed and approved by us, and now we have truly turned over." These small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households were also very grateful for the lenient treatment of the government and the workers, and many people shouted "Long live the working class!" on the spot, expressing that they would obey the leadership of the working class and do a good job in production in the future. Zheng Heping, the owner of a woodworking shop in Penglai District, brought back the apprentice he had fired the day after he received lenient treatment. These industrial and commercial households also actively participated in the "Five-Anti" campaign. After receiving the notices, the small and medium-sized households in Penglai District reported the illegal acts of their peers. According to the statistics of only three teams, more than 80 letters of report were received within two days.

In addition, the second battle of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign also took care of the follow-up work of the households inspected in the first battle. Among these inspected households, many have received processing orders entrusted by state enterprises and institutions. After the China Diesel Engine Company and Shanghai Pencil Factory were cleared of the "five poisons" by the inspection team, the government immediately provided assistance. The East China Industrial Department ordered 70 sets of pumps from the China Diesel Engine Company, and the East China Branch of the China General Merchandise Company and the Shanghai Pencil Factory signed a contract to exclusively sell all of the factory's products in April. The People's Bank also provided loans to the factory. In these factories, the workers' sense of being masters of the country has also been greatly strengthened. The workers' representatives of the above two factories took the initiative to discuss production with the capitalists and formulate production plans; the quality of the products has also been improved.

After the intense battles of the first and second battles, Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign has created relatively complete and mature experiences and methods, implemented the policy of combining unity and transformation, seriousness and leniency, and created good conditions for the entire movement in the future. At the same time, through the exercise of the two battles, a large number of worker cadres who are good at grasping policy and direction have also been trained, and cadres have been cultivated for the development of the third battle and even future production and construction. Now, the second battle of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" campaign has successfully concluded. Currently, the teams are being reorganized, experiences are being summarized, and preparations are being made to launch a larger-scale third battle.

    上海五反运动第二战役获得全胜
    现正总结经验准备更大规模展开第三战役
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的第二战役，经过十二天的紧张战斗，又获得了预期的巨大的胜利。截至本月十二日止，预定检查的二千户重点违法工商户，已有一千九百多户彻底交代了问题。同时，市增产节约委员会按照违法工商户分类标准和处理办法，迅速地分别处理了一万户中小工商户的问题，初步形成“五反”统一战线。
    上海市“五反”运动第二战役于四月一日宣布正式开始。这一战役除了充分运用和继续丰富了第一战役的经验之外，更突出地创造了“不战而胜”的光辉战例。根据完全破案的一千九百户违法工商户统计，不战而胜的达一千户，一触即溃的达五百户，仅四百户左右经过激烈的战斗。黄浦区二百八十二户中，即有二百零九户不战而胜。获得这一光辉胜利的主要原因，在于政策的深入人心，全国各大城市均取得了“五反”胜利的声威，以及广大群众积极参加斗争和第一战役取得完全胜利。上海市“五反”运动一开始就重视了政策宣传和发动工人、店员的工作。在第二战役开始以后，继续充分发动了私营企业中的工人、店员参加“五反”斗争。在这期间，各区的工人、店员都按行业或地区广泛地组织了“五反”委员会和“五反”工作队，积极发动和领导群众参加运动。到四月八日止，据二十二个区不完全的统计，全市已训练了二万五千多名基层工会干部和工人积极分子（包括高级职员），成立了一千多个“五反”委员会，二千五百四十个“五反”工作队，拥有五万多名“五反”工作队员。这些干部、积极分子和“五反”工作队员都是发动群众的骨干，他们带头诉苦，检举不法资本家的违法事实，按照工商户分类标准给资本家排队。全市举行了数以千计的控诉、检举大会，六十万私营企业中的工人、店员都卷入了运动，形成了上海“五反”运动的主力。同时，上海市增产节约委员会组织了一千个掌握材料并善于算账的检查队，严阵以待。他们不进入厂店则已，一进入必定突破。在第一战役中，增产节约委员会派遣了七十四个检查队进行重点试验，在十天之内就取得了完全的胜利，因此，检查队的声威大振。在第二战役的一千个检查队的前面，不法资本家的阵线纷纷解体，形成了“不战而胜”的有利条件。
    上海市“五反”运动的第二战役中，已经坦白而又愿意立功赎罪的违法资本家参加了战斗，这是上海“五反”运动中的一支新的力量，它迅速地推动了运动向前发展。各区增产节约委员会首先让第一战役中彻底坦白的违法资本家到处“现身说法”，讲述他们自己的违法事实、坦白经过和受到政府宽大处理的情形，动员劝导其他不法资本家自动坦白，争取政府的宽大处理。经过他们“现身说法”的结果，许多不法资本家慑于群众的威力和受到政府政策的感召，纷纷自动交代问题。在黄浦区召开的资本家坦白立功大会上，经过再次交代政策，又让第一战役中坦白的资本家现身说法，当场就有四十多户违法工商户表示愿意自动交代。这些违法资本家彻底交代自己的问题后，又被吸收参加“五反立功小组”，动员其他不法资本家坦白。黄浦区现在已有八十多人参加立功小组。老闸区亨大救火车制造厂老板在大会上坦白后，即参加了“立功小组”，检举了太平救火车制造厂资本家的违法事实。华新仪器文具厂老板顾庆生在第二战役中配合检查队和工人、店员对科学仪器馆、致力仪器公司、科达科学用品行进行“劝降”，使检查队在这三店中一战即胜。顾庆生并动员这三店的老板参加了立功小组，他们计划在第三战役中包打三十家科学仪器行。被检查的宝盛米号资本家起先不坦白，经同行吴虞明协助检查队查账，指出要害，该厂资本家即补充了材料。
    上海市“五反”运动第二战役还用“互助互评”的方法成功地查出了重点违法工商户的违法事实。在各区召开检查对象的资本家会议上，政府再次交代了政策和说明群众力量之后，许多不法资本家慑于群众的声威和受到政策的感召，纷纷表示愿意自动坦白，请求缓予检查。会后，各区增产节约委员会除了派遣检查队对少数拒不坦白的违法工商户进行检查外，即把这些愿意自动交代的资本家分成若干小组，让他们自报互评。在这批资本家中，有些慑于群众的威力和感激政府的宽大，一开始就比较彻底地交代了问题。杨树浦祥茂厂老板张震云在小组会上说：现在犯了罪政府还叫学习，再不坦白真对不起了。也有些人企图利用政府的宽大混过关去，但由于愿意立功赎罪的违法资本家都是过来人，都是内行，想蒙混的人也逃不过他们的眼睛。榆林区轻工业资本家小组互评会上，大业印刷厂老板开始只交代一些细小的问题，已经彻底坦白了的大成橡胶厂老板和九三梭子厂老板当时就指出他不老实，迫使大业老板不得不补充材料。黄浦区房地产中队资本家评议小组周洪泉自己交代后，指出祥华公司老板不老实。他说：“我吃地产饭几十年了，你的什么事情我不知道！”迫使祥华老板不得不全部交代问题。因此，通过资本家的互助互评，也就扩大了“不战而胜”的基础。
    上海市“五反”运动第二战役的另一个特点是：在解决重点违法工商户同时，市增产节约委员会派遣了大批工作组发动群众，处理了一万户中小工商户的问题，迅速形成了“五反”统一战线。对于中小户的处理，一般是从两方面进行的：一面召集老板开会，对他们说明政策，号召他们彻底坦白，以便获得政府的宽大处理；一面召集工人店员开会，号召他们根据老板的违法事实和工商户分类标准给老板排队，然后由工作组和工人店员核对老板的材料，进行审查，材料大体相符即予通过，不符的要老板作补充。等到材料核对确实后，即由增产节约委员会召开劳资大会，宣布定案。会上，除了对违法比较严重的工商户让其当众坦白，由群众予以严厉的批评外，其余都只作一般的批评，并勉励其今后正当经营，不再欺压工人。然后即发给通知书。经过这样处理后，工人店员都非常满意。蓬莱区中小户工人店员说：“老板的事要经我们审查通过，如今才真正翻身了。”这些中小工商户也非常感激政府和工人的宽大处理，许多人都当场高呼“工人阶级万岁！”表示要在今后服从工人阶级的领导，搞好生产。蓬莱区郑鹤平木作老板受到宽大处理后，回去第二天即把被他开除了的学徒找了回来。这些工商户并积极参加了“五反”运动。蓬莱区中小户在接到通知书后纷纷检举了他们同业的违法事实，仅三个中队的统计，两天内即收到检举信八十多件。
    此外，上海市“五反”运动第二战役还照顾了第一战役被检查户的善后工作。在这些被检查户中，许多已接到国家企业机关委托的加工定货。中国柴油机公司、上海铅笔厂经检查队消除“五毒”后，政府立即加以扶助，华东工业部向中柴公司订购了七十套帮浦，中国百货公司华东区公司和上海铅笔厂签订了合同，包销该厂四月份全部产品，人民银行并向该厂贷款。在这些工厂中，工人的国家主人翁感觉也大大加强。上述两厂的工人代表都主动地找资本家讨论生产，订立生产计划；产品质量也提高了。
    上海市的“五反”运动，经过第一、二两个战役的紧张战斗，已经创造了比较完整而成熟的经验和方法，贯彻了团结与改造、严肃与宽大相结合的方针，为今后整个运动创造了良好的条件。同时，经过两次战役的锻炼，也训练了大批善于掌握政策方针的工人干部，为开展第三战役以至今后的生产建设培养了干部。现在，上海市“五反”运动第二战役已胜利收兵，目前正在休整队伍，总结经验，准备更大规模地开展第三战役。
