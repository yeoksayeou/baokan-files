Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

    To the Editor: We have received the letters from readers forwarded to us by you, and have also seen the letters from readers published in the People's Daily on March 12, all suggesting that the Soviet translated film "Lenin in 1918" be re-screened. We accept this suggestion and have decided to re-screen the film from April 19th to 23rd in seven cinemas in Beijing: Red Star, Central, Tongle, Daguanlou, Pingan, Mingxing, and Daguangming.
