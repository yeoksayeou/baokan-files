Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 28th: The First Committee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission held a regular meeting on April 24. The American representative, Cohen, put forward a suggestion of "six principles" which he believed should serve as the basis for the committee's work, requesting the committee to consider it. Under the cover of these principles, the United States is actually putting forward its previous proposals again, the purpose of which is to lead the Disarmament Commission away from the main issue, to avoid discussing disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to talk about collecting information on armaments.

The Soviet representative, Malik, initially criticized the American proposal, especially pointing out the contradictions in the proposal. The "second principle" of the American proposal advocates "striving to achieve an open and above-board world, which is the only way to achieve effective disarmament," but if the American government continues to keep secret the situation regarding atomic weapons, radioactive weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, and if the American delegation postpones the work of providing such information by various countries to a distant and indefinite future, then it is impossible to imagine achieving an "open and above-board world."

Malik then spoke about the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by the American armed forces in Korea and China, saying: In the Disarmament Commission, many examples have been presented regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors against Korea and China. These crimes have been confirmed and verified by many representatives of world public opinion, including the International Democratic Women's Federation and the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and confirmed and verified by journalists from Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. The Soviet delegation has always firmly advocated, and still firmly advocates, that the Disarmament Commission pass a resolution on prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons and punishing those who violate this prohibition, in order to stop this shameful war crime. With the direct connivance of some member states of the Disarmament Commission, the American government has refused until now to issue a statement condemning the shameful bacteriological warfare, while at the same time the American army continues to use bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, massacring the people on a large scale. Acheson's recent remarks on this issue still avoided condemning the use of bacteriological weapons and bacteriological warfare.

Malik then exposed the shameful role played by Lie in this entire issue. He said: Lie initially supported Acheson's proposal to send representatives from the Swiss Red Cross to North Korea and China. After this proposal was exposed and rejected, Acheson, in order to cover up the crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea, spread the slanderous rumors that "epidemics occurred spontaneously" in Korea and China, and Lie immediately rushed to say that the World Health Organization was willing to "assist" Korea in "stamping out the diseases." This proposal, like the previous one, aimed to prevent the Disarmament Commission from discussing the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by American interventionists in Korea and China, and to actually collect information on the results and developments of the American use of bacteriological weapons against Korea and China under the banner of the World Health Organization. In his efforts to cover up the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons, Lie also openly insulted the Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. All this shows Lie's true role, showing how he defends the American interventionists' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, a behavior condemned by all honest people and prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

Malik asked the committee to note that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, had issued a statement, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Heon-young, had sent a telegram to the United Nations, protesting the American government's conduct of bacteriological warfare, but Lie did not allow these documents to be circulated as documents of the Disarmament Commission. In a letter dated March 31, the Soviet representative to the United Nations insisted that these documents be printed and distributed as documents of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, but this request has not been fulfilled to this day. At the same time, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the International Democratic Women's Federation had sent the statements of their special investigation teams to the United Nations Secretariat, but none of them had been printed as United Nations documents.

Malik said: The Soviet delegation once again firmly insists that the above-mentioned documents be printed as official documents of the Disarmament Commission, and that the Disarmament Commission must immediately pass a resolution on prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons and punishing those who violate the prohibition, in order to stop this shameful war crime.

    联合国裁军委员会第一委会举行例会
    马立克再度主张制止美国细菌战
    并揭发赖伊掩饰美国侵略者罪行的阴谋
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会第一委员会于四月二十四日举行例会。美国代表柯亨提出了他认为应作为委员会工作根据的“六条原则”的建议，要求委员会考虑。美国其实是在这些原则的掩护下，再次提出它以前的建议，其目的是要使裁减军备委员会离开正题，不讨论裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题，而谈论收集军备情报的问题。
    苏联代表马立克初步批评了美国的建议，特别指出这个建议中自相矛盾之处。美国建议的“第二条原则”主张“争取达到唯一能够实现有效裁减军备的开诚布公的世界”，可是如果美国政府仍然对原子武器、放射性武器、细菌武器以及其他种种大规模屠杀的武器的情况保持秘密，如果美国代表团把各国提供这种情报的工作推延到遥遥无期的最后阶段，那就不能设想达到“开诚布公的世界”。
    马立克接着谈到美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题说：在裁减军备委员会里，已经有人提出过关于美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的许多例子。这些罪行已经被世界舆论的许多代表，包括国际民主妇女联合会及国际民主法律工作者协会调查团所肯定和证实，并被英国、法国、中国、苏联及其他国家的记者所肯定和证实。苏联代表团一向坚决主张、而且现在仍然坚决主张裁减军备委员会通过一项关于禁止使用细菌武器并惩办破坏此项禁令者的决议，以制止这种可耻的战争罪行。在裁减军备委员会好些成员国的直接纵容下，美国政府一直到现在仍然拒绝发表声明谴责可耻的细菌战，而同时美国军队则继续在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，大规模屠杀人民。艾奇逊最近就这个问题所发表的言论仍然避免谴责使用细菌武器和细菌战。
    马立克接着揭发了赖伊在这整个问题上所起的可耻作用。他说：赖伊起初支持艾奇逊关于由瑞士红十字会派代表到北朝鲜和中国去的建议。在这个建议被揭穿并被拒绝后，艾奇逊为了掩盖美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的罪行，又散布所谓朝鲜和中国“自行发生流行病”的诽谤谰言，赖伊马上又赶快说，世界卫生组织愿意“协助”朝鲜“扑灭疾病”。这个建议和前一个建议一样，目的是要阻止裁减军备委员会讨论美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题，并打着世界卫生组织的招牌，实际上去收集美国对朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的结果和发展的情报。赖伊在他千方百计地替美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行掩饰时，还公然侮蔑朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。这些都表明了赖伊的真正角色，表明了他如何替美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的行为辩解，而美国干涉者这种行为是全体正直人民所谴责的，是一九二五年日内瓦议定书所禁止的。
    马立克要求委员会注意：中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来曾发表声明，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永曾致电联合国，抗议美国政府进行细菌战，可是赖伊却不允许把这些文件作为裁减军备委员会的文件传阅。苏联驻联合国代表在三月三十一日的信中，坚持把这些文件印发为联合国裁减军备委员会的文件，可是这个要求至今一直没有实现。同时，国际民主法律工作者协会和国际民主妇女联合会都曾把它们的专门调查团的声明送交联合国秘书处，但都没有被印发为联合国的文件。
    马立克说：苏联代表团再一次坚决主张把上述文件印发作为裁减军备委员会的正式文件，裁减军备委员会必须马上就禁止使用细菌武器及惩办破坏禁令者的问题通过决议，以制止这种可耻的战争罪行。
