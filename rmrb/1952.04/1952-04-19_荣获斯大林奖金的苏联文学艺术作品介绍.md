Introduction to Soviet Literary and Artistic Works Awarded the Stalin Prize

    Literary Works

    The most outstanding literary works in the Soviet Union last year were awarded the Stalin Prize. These works are characterized by a broad observation and epic presentation of things, as well as a deep psychological depiction of the protagonists.

    "To the New Shore," a novel by the Latvian writer Lācis, who won the first prize of the Stalin Prize, tells the story of the past twenty-five years of Latvia's life. This talented writer of working-class origin is very famous among Soviet readers. He is the son of a worker and has received a lot of life education; he worked as a dockworker, a stoker on a ship, and participated in the revolutionary movement. Currently, Lācis is the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Latvian Republic and an outstanding statesman of the Soviet state. The protagonists of his famous works, "Son of a Fisherman" and "Storm," are fishermen, sailors, and workers. Readers encountered these characters again in "To the New Shore." This novel tells the story of the revolutionary struggle of the laboring Latvians, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party, reached the new shore—socialism. It describes the establishment of Soviet Latvia. Lācis explained what a picture of construction unfolded before the people liberated from the shackles of capitalism.

    "Stories of Bukovina Villages" by the young Ukrainian writer Muratov and "Dawn of Saporozhye" by the Belarusian writer Bryl introduce readers to the lives of farmers in the western territories of Ukraine and Belarus that were reunited. "Stories of Bukovina Villages" is a story told by an old farmer, Karpuyuk, who found true happiness in the Soviet state and knew the joy of free labor. "Dawn of Saporozhye" tells the story of the development of collective farms in western Belarus. It illustrates how the lives of previously poor and disenfranchised farmers have changed and how the great creative power of the liberated people has awakened.

    Another work that won the Stalin Prize is Popovkin's novel "The Rubanyuk Family." This writer expresses his characters in several different situations—the pre-war period, the difficult period of fighting against the German fascist aggressors, and the period of peaceful labor after the victory. The story of the ordinary Ukrainian collective farmer Rubanyuk family shows the noble qualities of Soviet men and women, their spiritual purity, and their love and loyalty to the motherland.

    Painting and Sculpture

    More than three months ago, the Soviet Art Exhibition of 1951 was held at the State Tretyakov Gallery, exhibiting many oil paintings, sculptures, woodblock prints, and copperplate engravings, the most outstanding of which have won the Stalin Prize.

    Among the award-winning oil paintings is "Rest After Battle" by the young artist Neprintsev, based on the theme of Twardowski's famous poem "Vasily Terkin" (published in "Spark" magazine, Issue 8, 1952). This is Neprintsev's first major work. This oil painting depicts a combat hero loved by the Soviet people. This artist creates an image of an ordinary Soviet person—brave, enthusiastic, and with a beautiful sense of humor. He expresses the beauty and richness of the spiritual life of the Soviet people. This oil painting is painted in the best traditions of Russian realistic painting.

    The collective creation of artists Gritsay, Yefanov, Kotlyarov, etc., the monumental oil painting "Meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences" and a series of portraits of Soviet scientists, won a Stalin Prize. The oil painting depicts famous Soviet scientists discussing the construction project of the Volga-Don Canal. Its composition is very harmonious, and its lines are very precise. It has advanced the development of portrait painting art a big step forward. The famous Soviet poster artist Prokopov received the Stalin Prize for the second time. He has painted "Push Truman's Chariot into the Sea!" "American Military Police in Japan," and painted a series of illustrations for Mayakovsky's poems about the United States. These illustrations illustrate the poet's satirical poems very well, exposing the false democracy of the United States and revealing the true face of American imperialism, which brings destruction and death to millions of people. Prokopov's art is characterized by simplicity, and his works are meaningful and politically very strong.

    Among the sculptors who won the Stalin Prize are Mukhina, Tsilenaskaya, Ivanova, and Shadr, who sculpted the Gorky Monument erected in Moscow. They successfully shaped the moving statue of this giant of Russian literature, who is loved by millions of people.

    The bust of the great Russian writer Gogol, sculpted by the Soviet People's Artist Tomsky, is one of the most outstanding sculptures of last year. Tomsky has been sculpting Gogol's image for several years. The Gogol marble bust that won him the award is famous for being very realistic. This artist reproduced Gogol's moving portrait. Gogol believed in the genius of the people and believed in the glorious future of Russia.

    One of the oldest sculptors in the Soviet Union, Vatagin, also won the Stalin Prize. He sculpted some animal figures. He brilliantly expressed the characteristics and behaviors of various animals.

    Color Documentary Films

    Last year, Soviet documentary films about the Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Kazakh, Turkmen, and Tajik Soviet Republics gloriously won the Stalin Prize.

    Each of these films depicts the vivid deeds of the people of all ethnic groups liberated by the October Revolution, who have embarked on the victorious road of communism. In the film "Flourishing Ukraine," and in other films, the characteristics of the future communist society can be clearly seen everywhere: from the most modern mechanization of underground work in the Donbass mining area, from the fertile grain fields, and most importantly from the Soviet people, from workers, collective farmers, tractor drivers and many others, people can clearly see the characteristics of the future communist society. For the Soviet people, working for the country is a glorious and proud thing.

    A theme that runs through all the films about the Central Asian republics is: the people are fighting to conquer the desert, striving to transform nature and to open up new fields. The fruits of this selfless labor are very precious. The backward border areas of Tsarist Russia are now flourishing Soviet republics. The Turkmen Republic and the Kazakh Republic are famous for their achievements in large-scale livestock breeding on collective farms and state farms. Brilliant cotton grows in the Tajik Republic. All these republics have well-equipped industries; art, education, and science have reached new heights.

    荣获斯大林奖金的苏联文学艺术作品介绍
    文学作品
    苏联去年最优秀的文学作品都荣获了斯大林奖金。这些作品的特点是对事物作了广泛的观察和史诗式的表现，并且对主人公作了深刻的心理描写。
    荣膺斯大林奖金一等奖的拉脱维亚作家拉齐斯的长篇小说“到新海岸”叙述了拉脱维亚过去二十五年来的生活。这位劳动人民出身的有才能的作家在苏联读者中间颇负盛名。他是一个工人的儿子，受过了很多生活的教育；他当过码头工人、轮船上的火伕，并且参加过革命运动。目前，拉齐斯是拉脱维亚共和国部长会议主席，苏维埃国家一位出色的政治家。他的著名作品——“一个渔夫的儿子”和“暴风雨”——里的主人公都是渔夫、海员和工人。读者们在“到新海岸”这部作品中又遇到了这些人物。这部小说叙述了劳苦的拉脱维亚人革命斗争的故事，他们在共产党领导之下走到了新的海岸——社会主义。它描写了苏维埃拉脱维亚的建立。拉齐斯说明了从资本主义桎梏中解放出来的人民的眼前展开了怎样的一幅建设的图景。
    乌克兰青年作家穆拉托夫的“布柯维纳村的故事”和白俄罗斯作家布里尔的“萨波洛蒂耶的黎明”向读者介绍了重新归并乌克兰和白俄罗斯的西部疆土的农民的生活。“布柯维纳村的故事”是由一个老农民卡尔普尤克讲出来的故事，这个农民在苏维埃国家中才发现真正的幸福，才知道自由劳动的快乐。“萨波洛蒂耶的黎明”叙述了白俄罗斯西部集体农场的发展。它说明了以前穷苦无权的农民的生活是怎样改变的，被解放了的人民的伟大创造力量是怎样觉醒起来的。
    另一部荣获斯大林奖金的作品便是波波夫金的长篇小说“鲁班纽克的家庭”。这位作家把他的人物表现在几种不同的情况中——战前时期、对德国法西斯侵略者作战的艰苦考验时期，以及胜利以后的和平劳动时期。乌克兰普通集体农民鲁班纽克家庭的故事显示出苏联男女高尚的品质，他们精神的纯洁，以及他们对于祖国的热爱与忠诚。绘　画、雕　塑
    三个月多以前在国立特列甲科夫艺术陈列馆举行的一九五一年苏联艺术展览会上，展览了许多油画，雕塑，木版画和铜版画，其中最优秀的作品已荣获斯大林奖金。
    在得奖的油画中，有青年艺术家涅普宁柴夫根据特瓦尔多夫斯基的著名诗篇“华西里·台尔金”的主题而绘的“战罢歇息”（载“星火”杂志一九五二年第八期）。这是涅普宁柴夫的第一幅巨大的作品。这一幅油画绘出被苏联人民所热爱的一位战斗英雄。这一位艺术家创造出一个普通的苏联人的形象——勇敢、热诚、具有优美的幽默感。他表现了苏联人的精神生活的美好和丰富。这一幅油画是以俄国现实主义的绘画的最优秀的传统绘成的。
    艺术家格里查、叶伐诺夫、柯特里雅罗夫等的集体创作，纪念碑性的油画“苏联科学院主席团会议”及一系列苏联科学家们的画像，荣获了一个斯大林奖金。油画绘出著名的苏联科学家们在讨论伏尔加河—顿河运河的建设工程。它的配置非常调和，线条非常精确。它把肖像画艺术的发展向前推进了一大步。苏联著名招贴画家普罗洛科夫第二次得到斯大林奖金。他曾经绘就“把杜鲁门的战车推到海里去！”“美国宪兵在日本”，并替马耶可夫斯基关于美国的诗篇画了一系列的插画。这些插画把那位诗人的讽刺诗用图画予以很好的说明，那些诗篇暴露出美国虚伪的民主政治，并揭露带给千万人以毁灭和死亡的美国帝国主义的真正面孔。普罗洛科夫的艺术以简洁著称，他的作品意味深长，政治性非常强烈。
    在荣获斯大林奖金的雕塑家中，有雕塑在莫斯科竖立的高尔基纪念碑的穆希娜、齐伦斯卡娅、伊凡诺娃和沙得尔等。他们成功地塑造了这位为千万人民所热爱的俄国文坛巨人的动人的雕像。
    苏联人民艺术家托穆斯基所塑造的俄国伟大作家果戈理的胸像，是去年雕像中最优秀的作品之一。托穆斯基雕刻果戈理的像已有几年。使他获奖的果戈理大理石胸像，因非常逼真而著名。这位艺术家再现了果戈理的感人的肖像。果戈理相信人民的天才，相信俄国的辉煌的将来。
    苏联最老的雕刻家之一，瓦泰金也荣获斯大林奖金。他雕塑了一些动物像。他天才地表现了各种动物的特色和行为。
    五　彩　纪　录　影　片
    去年苏联关于乌克兰、立陶宛、哈萨克、土库曼与塔吉克等各苏维埃共和国的文献纪录影片，光荣地获得了斯大林奖金。
    每一部这样的影片都描绘了被十月革命解放出来的各族人民、已走上胜利的共产主义道路的各族人民的生动事迹。在“繁荣的乌克兰”这部影片中，和在其他影片中一样，处处可以很清楚地看出未来的共产主义社会的特征：从顿巴斯矿区地下工作最新式的机械化上面，从丰饶的谷田中，而最重要的是从苏联人民的身上，从工人、集体农民、拖拉机手和许多其他的人的身上，人们可以很清楚地看出未来的共产主义社会的特征。对苏联人民说，为国家工作便是一种光荣而值得自豪的事。
    贯穿着关于中亚细亚各共和国的一切影片的一个主题便是：人民为征服沙漠而斗争、为改造自然并为开辟新的田地而努力。这种忘我劳动所产生的果实是非常珍奇的。过去沙皇俄罗斯的落后的边陲之区，现在是繁荣的苏维埃共和国了。土库曼共和国和哈萨克共和国因为他们以集体农场和国家农场上的大规模牲畜饲养业的成就而闻名。塔吉克共和国中生长着光辉灿烂的棉花。所有这些共和国都有设备极好的工业；艺术、教育和科学都已达到新的高峰。
