Xinhua News Agency:
The atrocities of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria-laden insects and other poisonous substances in Korea and Northeast China have aroused boundless indignation among the people of our country. The people of our country unanimously demand that the American aggressors who are conducting bacteriological warfare be given the most severe and just punishment. The "Investigation Team of the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" was formed based on the above-mentioned demands of the people of the whole country, and according to the resolution of the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the China Peace Committee on March 12. Part of the investigation team is conducting on-the-spot investigations in Korea. Our Northeast Branch is another part of the investigation team. We - the entire members of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team of the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" whose names are signed below, including experts in various natural sciences, experts in international law, representatives of people's organizations, as well as literary, artistic, and journalistic workers. Our on-the-spot investigation work lasted for half a month and was completed by March 31. Based on the conclusive facts obtained from our on-the-spot investigation, we hereby submit the following report.

In the past half-month, we conducted on-the-spot inspections and visits at twenty-one sites in the Shenyang, Andong, Kuandian, and Fushun areas where American planes were found to have dropped insects and other poisonous substances carrying germs and viruses, collected various pieces of evidence, listened to statements from local governments and people about the dropping of bacterial insects by American planes, and inspected the test results of local health and epidemic prevention inspection agencies.

The large amount of testimonial and material evidence obtained from our on-the-spot visits and inspections fully proves the heinous crimes of American planes dropping various insects and other objects containing germs and viruses in large quantities in the Northeast China region.

First of all, we paid attention to the fact that American planes have continuously and massively invaded the airspace of the People's Republic of China since late February until now. According to statistics from the Northeast Air Defense Agency, from February 29 to March 21 alone, a total of 175 batches and 955 sorties of American planes invaded the Northeast China region. Most of these American planes intruded on cloudy days and at night. The nature of the activities after these American planes intruded is now clear. Except for seventeen aircraft on March 1, 5, and 16 that bombed and strafed Changdianhekou, Linjiang County, and Jian Station in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, injuring residents and destroying houses, the task of the vast majority of American planes that intruded into our country's airspace was to spread insects and other objects carrying germs and viruses.

Secondly, we focused on investigating the direct evidence of American planes dropping bacterial insects and other poisonous substances. Residents in many places confirmed to us that they personally saw American planes dropping things shaped like packages, which scattered when they fell to low altitudes. Afterwards, large numbers of flies, mosquitoes, spiders, black springtails, and other insects, as well as leaves, bird feathers, and cotton wads were found on the ground. We also discovered American military aircraft-dropped germ bombs. On March 22, a team from our investigation team conducted an on-the-spot inspection of the wreckage of an American germ bomb in a farmer's field near the river beach in Louhetao Village outside the east gate of Kuandian County (about two li from the county seat) in the urban-rural area. With the testimony of witness merchant Han Yongbin, epidemic prevention personnel Li Qiwen (female), student Li Sijian, Kuandian Town Mayor Gao Junshan, and Kuandian County People's Government County Chief Hu An, this germ bomb was dropped by an American plane on March 12. At 12:52 p.m. that day, eight American planes flew over from west to east. Han Yongbin, the owner of the Tongjuhe grocery store inside the south gate of Kuandian City, personally saw one of them drop a white object. This white object descended very slowly, and at low altitude, it was clearly seen to be gray, cylindrical, and descending diagonally to the northeast. He estimated at the time that it probably landed in the east gate. He immediately told Li Qiwen, an epidemic prevention team member who was walking by, about this situation. Then he hurried to the Kuandian Town Government and reported to Mayor Gao Junshan. The town government and epidemic prevention team sent many people to search the city inside the east gate that afternoon, but to no avail. This "white object" was finally discovered by Li Sijian, a first-year student at Kuandian Middle School, at 1:30 p.m. on March 21. Hu An, the county chief of Kuandian County, also went to the scene for inspection that afternoon after being reported. A team from this investigation team (composed of entomology experts Liu Chongle, Ma Shijun, entomology worker Guo Shutian, photojournalist Wang Chunde, and guard Wang Shanlin) rushed to the area at noon on March 22 to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. After their judgment, this silver-gray object was a specially made American germ bomb. This germ bomb created a crater about twelve centimeters deep when it landed. Three meters away from the crater, a bent iron germ bomb central axis was found, with a bent circular iron plate connected to one end of the central axis. The central axis was 25 centimeters long and 0.7 centimeters in diameter. The top of the axis had a hexagonal screw, with a diameter of 1.1 centimeters. The lower end of the central axis also had the same screw, with the upper diameter being one centimeter and the lower diameter being three centimeters. The circular iron plate connected to the lower end of the central axis had a diameter of 19 centimeters. About eight meters northwest of the crater, there were scattered and piled-up bird feathers, including yellow and white down feathers, and black flight feathers. The quill tubes were clean and intact, without any flesh or soil, and there were no bird corpses or bones around the feathers. In an area extending about 15 meters southwest of the crater, hundreds of fragments of silver-gray, plaster-like shell pieces of varying sizes were scattered on the ground. These fragments were extremely thin, brittle, and easily broken. When County Chief Hu An inspected the crater, there were still a large number of flies, mosquitoes, spiders, black springtails, and other poisonous insects around the crater and in nearby areas. Based on the above facts, it can be completely determined that this object dropped by the American plane was a specially made American germ bomb. It utilized the easily broken nature of the shell to shatter the bomb body and scatter bacterial insects and bird feathers over a wide area of the ground. This wreckage of the germ bomb and other evidence is the most powerful direct evidence of the heinous bacteriological warfare waged by U.S. imperialism against our people.

Secondly, we noted that a large number of flies (including blowflies, green bottle flies, large houseflies, dung flies, houseflies, horseflies, etc.), mosquitoes (including midges, Korean spotted leg mosquitoes, Culex mosquitoes, winter crane flies, etc.), spiders, black springtails, ants, fleas, locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects were successively found in various places after enemy aircraft intrusions. Judging from the relationship between the discovery area of these insects and the intrusion of American aircraft, the distribution of these insects, and the places and seasons where these insects appeared, there is no doubt that these insects were spread by American aircraft.

1.  The locations where these insects were found were all in the areas where American aircraft intruded and operated, and in nearby places. However, in most other places at the same latitude, temperature, and geographical conditions, the above-mentioned insects have not been found to this day. We checked the records of American aircraft intrusions in the Northeast and the reports of the locations where insects were found, and this was completely confirmed.

2.  The distribution of these insects shows a segmented, dense state. For example, according to the report of Zhang Shu, Mayor of Fushun City People's Government: After the city first discovered poisonous insects on March 3, it conducted multiple comprehensive and in-depth inspections. As of March 20, the area where insects were found was determined to be 3,687,380 square meters, or 3.68738 square kilometers. These insects were densely distributed in segments. However, during the same period, the above-mentioned insects were not found in the remaining 546 square kilometers of the city. According to the report of Zhang Tie, Director of the Health Department of Liaodong Province People's Government: The black springtails discovered in Dabiangou Village, Seventh District, Xinbin County on March 4 were distributed along the telephone line, 250 meters long from north to south and 200 meters wide. From Sanchakou to Beiyinsi in Gushan Town, Andong County on March 13, mosquitoes, flies, etc. were found over a distance of two li in length and half a li in width, with more than 60 insects per square meter. On the same day, mosquitoes were found in the front ditch of Sunjiaying Village, Dianqing Village, Daying District, Zhuanghe County, covering an area of about 1,500 square meters, with about 100 insects per square meter. The highest density of some poisonous insects reached about 70 per square meter. We conducted an on-the-spot inspection of the situation in Jiuzhan Village, Jiuzhan District, Shenyang City (about 40 li from Fushun) where black springtails, flies, and mosquitoes were found. According to the confirmation of the witness, the elderly farmer Zhao Wenxiu, when these insects were first discovered in the area on March 3, they were also densely concentrated on the ground two li wide and one li long. This segmented and dense distribution of insects is fundamentally different from the common and scattered distribution of naturally growing insects in the local area.

3.  The places where these insects appeared and their habitat and activity were abnormal. The facts are as follows: (1) Green bottle flies were discovered on the cement basketball court near the dormitory of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government on Yangwu Street in Shenyang City on March 15. It was abnormal, whether by season or location. (2) Large numbers of flies and mosquitoes were found in large quantities on beaches, high mountain slopes, or completely exposed farmland in Andong City and Kuandian County, and even on snow. This is also impossible under normal circumstances, because mosquitoes and flies live near water, in weeds, garbage heaps, and places where humans and animals live. (3) Black springtails were found on the six-meter-high steel and concrete stands of the Fushun Racecourse. (4) Locusts should be found in the wilderness or farmland by rivers and lakes, but they were found on the second-floor open-air cement platform of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government in Shenyang City in the cold weather in mid-March. Obviously, if they were not scattered by American aircraft, it would be impossible for these insects to appear in the above-mentioned places.

4.  Many insects were discovered much earlier than naturally occurring insects in the local area. For example: In the Northeast region, male adults of Culex mosquitoes should appear no earlier than mid-May, green bottle flies should appear in June, and locusts should appear in May and June. However, all three of the above insects were discovered near the dormitory of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government in Shenyang City on March 15. Houseflies should appear no earlier than late April, but a large number of male and female adults were discovered in Siping City, Liaoxi Province in mid-March. Dung flies should appear no earlier than late April, but they were found in large quantities in the fifth and sixth districts of Jinzhou City in mid-March. Ants should appear on dry land no earlier than mid-April, but a large number of ants were found in Kuandian Chengguan in early March, where the ground was covered with ice and snow and there was no dry soil around. Spiders should not be active until after mid-April, but a large number of spiders were found in Zhenjiangshan, Andong Town around March 3. Korean spotted leg mosquitoes should appear no earlier than late May, but male and female adults of this mosquito were discovered in Tieling, Liaoxi Province on March 4.

The above materials prove that the large number of flies, mosquitoes, spiders, black springtails and other insects found in the Northeast region could not have occurred naturally in the Northeast region, but were obviously specially cultivated by American bacteriological warfare factories using artificial methods, and were spread by American aircraft.

During our work in the Northeast, we inspected the results of bacterial and viral tests from the epidemic prevention and inspection agencies in Shenyang, Andong, Kuandian, and Fushun. The experts from the four places unanimously proved that the various insects and other objects dropped by American aircraft carried various germs and viruses. The following is part of this test result:

(1) Anthrax bacilli were found on bird feathers dropped by American aircraft. This type of bacteria is seriously harmful to farm animals (cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, etc.) and can also be transmitted to humans. The experimental sample was dropped by American aircraft in Beijingzi Village, Beijingzi District, Andong County on March 11. Xin Jun, Jing Guanhua, and Zhao Chenglin, bacteriology experts working in Shenyang, took 0.5 cc of the bird feather washing liquid and injected it into two white mice, both of which developed convulsions within 36 hours and died. Anthrax bacilli were found in the original feathers and dead mice. In addition, anthrax bacilli were also found in houseflies dropped by American aircraft in Siping City on March 17.

(2) Pathogenic bipolar staining bacilli, namely Pasteurella, were found on spiders dropped by American aircraft. Plague bacteria and chicken and duck hemorrhagic septicemia bacteria all belong to this type of bacteria. It was later found that the bacteria found on the spiders were the pathogens of chicken and duck hemorrhagic septicemia. This bacteria was found in Shenyang by bacteriology expert Jing Guanhua.

(3) Typhoid bacilli were found in large houseflies dropped by American aircraft. This type of bacteria is the pathogen of typhoid fever, which seriously endangers humans. The experimental sample was dropped by American aircraft near the dormitory of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government on Yangwu Street, Shenyang City on the night of March 15. The inspector was bacteriology expert Jing Guanhua.

(4) Typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli were found in dung flies and midges dropped by American aircraft. The experimental samples were dropped by American aircraft in the fifth and sixth districts of Jinzhou City. Bacteriology expert Jing Guanhua found paratyphoid bacilli on dung flies; typhoid bacilli were found on midges.

(5) Rickettsiae were found on black springtails dropped by American aircraft. This is the pathogen of a class of diseases that seriously endanger humans, such as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The experimental sample was dropped by American aircraft in Jiuzhan Village, Jiuzhan District, Shenyang City. The inspectors were bacteriology experts Zhu Jiming and Wei Wenbin.

(6) A virus of acute encephalitis was found in winter crane flies dropped by American aircraft. Since March 9, there have been many deaths due to acute encephalitis in Anshan and other cities. Experts have proven through testing that this encephalitis is unprecedented in our country. Experts' tests also proved that the pathological changes caused by the virus carried by the winter crane flies dropped by American aircraft in Anshan and other places where this encephalitis was found were exactly the same as this encephalitis. This encephalitis virus was identified by six experts: Li Peilin, Xu Yingkui, Zhu Jiming, Zhang Xuede, Wu Zhizhong, and Jing Guanhua.

Chinese natural scientists are continuing to carry out inspection and research work, and they will surely fully expose the various types of bacteriological warfare and biological warfare weapons used by American aggressors.

Based on the above facts, we have come to the following conclusions:

First, the U.S. government has systematically and massively used military aircraft to invade our great, free and independent motherland - the People's Republic of China. This large-scale act of aggression by the U.S. government is still ongoing.

Second, American military aircraft that invade the sacred airspace of the People's Republic of China not only carry out bombing and strafing, but also systematically and massively use bacteriological warfare weapons prohibited by human conscience, international law, and international conventions, such as bacteriological and biological warfare weapons. As mentioned above, American aircraft have invaded various parts of Northeast China, using bacterial bombs and other bacterial insect containers to spread large amounts of various insects and other media objects carrying encephalitis viruses and typhoid, paratyphoid, typhus, anthrax, hemorrhagic septicemia and other bacteria. The purpose of the American aggressors in using bacteriological and biological warfare weapons is to attempt to kill a large number of peaceful Chinese people and destroy Chinese livestock, poultry and crops. This barbaric act of aggression by the U.S. government is still ongoing.

Third, the above-mentioned inhuman acts of aggression committed by the U.S. government against the People's Republic of China are carried out secretly and are a particularly despicable, dirty, and shameless robber-style act of aggression.

Fourth, the above-mentioned barbaric and despicable acts of aggression committed by the U.S. government against the People's Republic of China not only constitute the crime of aggression, but also the crime of violating humanitarian principles and the crime of violating international law and the laws of war. This act of aggressive warfare by the U.S. government against the People's Republic of China using bacteriological warfare weapons completely violates the provisions of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on "prohibiting the use of poisonous weapons" and the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which has been signed and ratified by the vast majority of countries in the world and has therefore become a recognized principle of civilized humanity, on "prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons."

Fifth, based on the above points, the U.S. government's use of bacteriological warfare weapons to carry out robber-style aggression not only constitutes a serious threat to the Chinese and Korean people, but also constitutes a serious threat to human justice, civilization, and world peace, and a serious threat to all mankind.

We solemnly condemn the shameless attempts of the U.S. government and U.S. military leaders, such as Acheson and Ridgway, to deny their responsibility for the crime of conducting bacteriological warfare. The large amount of conclusive and undeniable evidence obtained from our on-the-spot investigation has thoroughly refuted their sophistry and denials. The above-mentioned irrefutable facts fully prove that the denial of their heinous crimes by the U.S. government and the heads of the U.S. invading army is an extremely contemptible act of robbery and hooliganism.

We solemnly appeal to the people of China and the people of the world who love peace and freedom: immediately unite and act to stop the American aggressors from carrying out the inhuman act of bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. We demand that the heads of the U.S. government and the U.S. military who are conducting bacteriological warfare, as well as those unconscionable scum in the U.S. scientific community, be listed as war criminals and handed over to the world's people for public trial so that they may be severely punished.

We firmly believe that the heinous bacteriological warfare carried out by the American aggressors can be defeated by us. In the past half-month, we have personally seen that the people of Northeast China, under the banner of Mao Zedong and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have formed a strong and massive people's anti-bacteriological warfare front. Experts in various natural sciences and the broad masses of the people in the Northeast region have closely united, displayed high wisdom, creativity, vigilance, and the patriotic spirit of heroic struggle, thereby effectively extinguishing and extinguishing the bacterial insects spread by the United States, so that the American bacteriological warfare weapons have not been able to achieve the effects they expected until now. This encouraging fact makes us very confident that as long as all our patriotic compatriots in China continue to unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, work together, and unite and work together with the people of the world who love peace and justice, the heinous bacteriological warfare carried out by U.S. imperialism will be completely crushed by us.

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团
    关于美帝国主义在中国东北地区撒布细菌罪行调查报告书
    美国侵略者在朝鲜及我国东北地区撒布细菌毒虫的暴行，已引起我全国人民的无比愤怒。我国人民一致要求给予进行细菌战的美国侵略者以最严厉的正义制裁。“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”就是基于全国人民的上述要求，并根据中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会三月十二日常务委员会扩大会议的决议而组成的。调查团的一部分，正在朝鲜地区进行实地调查。我们东北分团，是调查团的另一部分。我们——在下面签名的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团全体人员，包括自然科学各科专家，国际法学专家和人民团体的代表，以及文学、艺术、新闻工作者等。我们的实地调查工作，历时半月，到三月三十一日为止已宣告完成。根据我们实地调查所获得的确凿事实，特提出如下报告。
    在过去半个月之内，我们在沈阳、安东、宽甸和抚顺地区的二十一个曾经发现美国飞机撒下带有病菌和病毒的昆虫及其他毒物的现场，进行了实地勘察和访问，搜集了各种证物，听取了当地政府和人民关于美国飞机投掷细菌毒虫情况的陈述，并察看了当地卫生防疫检验机构的检验结果。
    我们实地访问和勘察所得的大量人证物证，充分地证实了美国飞机在我国东北地区大量投掷含有病菌和病毒的各种昆虫和其他物体的万恶罪行。
    我们首先注意了美国飞机自二月下旬以来，直到现在，连续大规模地侵入中华人民共和国领空的事实。根据东北防空机构的统计，仅自二月二十九日起到三月二十一日止的时间内，侵入我国东北地区的美国飞机，即共达一百七十五批，九百五十五架次。这些美国飞机大部分是在阴天及夜间侵入的。侵入活动的地区包括辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江等省的七十个县市。这些美国飞机侵入后活动的性质，现在已经查明，除三月一日、五日及十六日曾有十七架在辽东省的宽甸县长甸河口、临江县及辑安车站进行轰炸扫射，并炸伤居民、毁坏民房以外，其余绝大多数美国飞机侵入我国领空活动的任务，是撒布带有病菌、病毒的昆虫及其他物体。
    其次，我们着重地调查了美国飞机投下细菌毒虫及其他毒物的直接证据。许多地方的居民向我们证实：他们亲眼看见美国飞机丢下东西，形状像一个包，落到低空时即散开，以后即在地上找到大量的蝇子、蚊子、蜘蛛、黑跳虫等昆虫，和树叶、禽类羽毛及棉花团等。我们也发现了美国军用飞机所投掷的细菌弹。三月二十二日，我们调查团的一个小组实地勘察了宽甸县城厢区东门外村漏河套（距县城约二华里）靠近河滩的农田里的一个美国细菌弹的残骸。经过见证人商人韩永斌、防疫人员李启文（女）、学生李思俭、宽甸镇公所镇长高俊山、宽甸县人民政府县长胡安的证明，这个细菌弹是美国飞机在三月十二日投下的。那一天十二时五十二分，美国飞机八架自西向东飞过，宽甸城南门里同聚合杂货铺掌柜韩永斌亲眼看见其中一架投下一个白色物体。这白色物体降落得很慢，到低空时就清楚地看出这物体呈灰色，长筒形，向东北方向斜降，他当时估计大概是落在东门里。他当即把这一情况告诉正从该地走过的防疫队员李启文。随后他又赶到宽甸镇公所，向镇长高俊山报告。镇公所和防疫队当天下午就派了很多人到东门城里搜查未获。这一“白色物体”终于在三月二十一日午后一时三十分为宽甸中学一年级学生李思俭所发现。宽甸县胡安县长据报后，亦于当天下午到现场勘察。本调查团的一个小组（由昆虫学专家刘崇乐、马世骏、昆虫学工作者郭书田、摄影记者王纯德、警卫员王善林五人组成）在三月二十二日中午赶到该地作了实地调查。经他们判明，这个银灰色物体，是美国特制的一种细菌弹。这个细菌弹落地时，造成一个约十二公分深的弹坑。距弹坑三公尺的地方即发现一个业已折弯的铁制的细菌弹中轴，和在中轴的一端串连着的业已折弯的一块圆形铁盘。中轴长二十五公分，轴的周径零点七公分。轴的顶端有六角形螺丝，周径一点一公分。中轴的下端也有同样螺丝，上周径是一公分，下周径是三公分。中轴下端所串连的圆形铁盘，直径十九公分。在弹坑西北约八公尺处有分散的和成堆的禽类羽毛，其中有黄色和白色的短绒毛，有黑色的翎毛，翎管干净而完整，没有任何肉质或泥土，羽毛的周围又无任何禽类的尸骸或骨骼。在距弹坑向西南延长约十五公尺的一片地段，有数百块大小不等涂着银灰色的类似石膏质的破碎弹片散落地上。这些弹片是极薄、脆而易碎的。在胡安县长视察弹坑时，弹坑周围及附近地区仍有大量蝇、蚊、蜘蛛、黑跳虫等毒虫。根据上述事实可以完全判明：这个美国飞机投下的物体是美国特制的一种细菌弹。它是利用弹壳易碎的性质，使弹身破碎，并使细菌毒虫及禽类羽毛散布到广大的地面的。这一细菌弹残骸及其他证物，就是美帝国主义对我国人民进行灭绝人性的细菌战的最有力的直接证据。
    其次，我们注意了：各地在敌机侵入以后，都相继发现了大量蝇（包括花蝇、绿蝇、大家蝇、粪蝇、家蝇、牛蝇等种类）、蚊（包括摇蚊、高丽豹脚蚊、库雷蚊、冬大蚊等种类）、蜘蛛、黑跳虫、蚂蚁、跳蚤、飞蝗、棱蝗、蟋蟀等类虫子。就这些虫子的发现地区与美国飞机的侵入情况的关系、这些虫子的分布状况、这些虫子出现的场所和季节等各方面来看，这些虫子都无可怀疑地是美国飞机所撒布的。
    一、这些昆虫的发现地点，都是美国飞机侵入和活动的地区及其附近地方。而在同一纬度、同一气温和同样地理条件下的其他大部分地方，却到现在还没有发现上述虫子。我们对照地查看了美国飞机侵入东北活动的纪录和发现昆虫地点的报告，完全证实了这一点。
    二、这些昆虫的分布，表现为有段落的密集状态。例如据抚顺市人民政府张澍市长的报告：该市自三月三日首先发现毒虫后，多次进行普遍、深入的检查。到三月二十日为止，经查明发现昆虫的面积共为三百六十八万七千三百八十平方公尺，即三点六八七三八平方公里。这些昆虫是有段落地密集分布的。但在同一时期，在该市的其余五百四十六平方公里的面积上都没有发现上述昆虫。另据辽东省人民政府卫生厅张铁厅长报告：三月四日新宾县第七区大边沟村发现的黑跳虫，分布地区沿电话线路南北长二百五十公尺，宽二百公尺。三月十三日安东县孤山镇三岔口到背阴寺发现蚊、蝇等长二华里，宽半里，每平方公尺六十多个。同日庄河县大营区殿庆村孙家营屯前沟发现蚊子，面积约一千五百平方公尺，每平方公尺约一百余个。有些毒虫密度最高竟达每平方公尺七十个左右。我们实地勘察了沈阳市旧站区旧站村（离抚顺约四十华里）发现黑跳虫、蝇子、蚊子的情形。根据见证人老年农民赵文秀的证实，该地于三月三日首先发现黑跳虫等昆虫时，这些虫子也是在两华里宽、一华里长的地面密集着的。昆虫的这种有段落的密集分布，是与本地自然生长的昆虫的普遍地分散地分布的情形根本不同的。
    三、这些昆虫出现的场所和栖居活动情形，是反常的。事实如下：（一）绿蝇在沈阳市扬武街的东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近的洋灰篮球场上被发现，时间是在三月十五日，不论按季节来说，或按地点来说，都是反常的。（二）大量的蝇、蚊，在安东市及宽甸县的沙滩、高山坡上或完全暴露的农田里，甚至在雪地上大量发现。这按照正常情况也是不可能的，因为蚊、蝇是在水的附近，在杂草、垃圾堆和人畜居住的地方栖居的。（三）黑跳虫曾发现在抚顺市跑马场的六公尺高的钢骨水泥的看台上。（四）蝗虫应在河流湖边的荒草或农地里发现，但却在三月中旬寒冷的天气里在沈阳市东北人民政府贸易部的二层露天的水泥平台上发现。很显然，如果不是由美国飞机撒下来，上述各处是不可能出现这些昆虫的。
    四、许多昆虫发现的时间，较本地自然发生的昆虫早得多。例如：在东北地区，库雷蚊的雄性成虫最早应在五月中旬才能出现，绿蝇应在六月间出现，蝗虫应在五、六月出现。但是以上三种昆虫，三月十五日都在沈阳市东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近发现了。家蝇应在四月下旬才能出现，但是在三月中旬却在辽西省的四平市大量发现了雌雄成虫。粪蝇最早应在四月下旬才能出现，但是在三月中旬却在锦州市的第五区、第六区大量发现。蚂蚁应在四月中旬以后在干燥的土地上才能出现，但是宽甸城关却在三月初旬遍地冰雪、周围没有干土的地方发现了很多蚂蚁。蜘蛛应在四月中旬以后才能活动，但是在三月三日安东市镇江山一带就发现了大量蜘蛛。高丽豹脚蚊最早应在五月下旬才能出现，但是辽西省的铁岭在三月四日就发现了这种蚊子的雌雄成虫。
    上述各种材料证明，东北地区所大量发现的蝇子、蚊子、蜘蛛、黑跳虫等昆虫，都不可能是东北地区所自然发生的，而显然是美国细菌战工厂用人工的方法所特别培养出来，并由美国飞机撒布下来的。
    我们在东北工作的期间，曾察看了沈阳、安东、宽甸、抚顺四个地方防疫检验机关的细菌、病毒检验结果。四个地方的专家们一致证明，美国飞机所投下的各种昆虫及其他物体，是带有各种病菌和病毒的。以下就是这种检验结果的一部分：
    （一）在美国飞机投下的禽类羽毛上查出了炭疽杆菌。这类病菌是严重危害耕畜（牛、马、骡、驴等）的，也能传染人类。实验的样品是三月十一日美国飞机在安东县北井子区北井子村投下的。在沈阳从事检验工作的细菌学专家辛钧、景冠华、赵成林，把禽类羽毛洗液各取零点五西西注射于两只小白鼠，两只小白鼠在三十六小时内均发生痉挛，以致死亡。从原始羽毛及死鼠内，均发现炭疽杆菌。此外，在美国飞机于三月十七日在四平市投下的家蝇中，也发现有炭疽杆菌。
    （二）在美国飞机投下的蜘蛛身上查出了有致病力的两端浓染杆菌，即巴士德属杆菌，而鼠疫病菌及鸡、鸭出血性败血病的病菌，均属于这类杆菌。后经查明，在蜘蛛身上所查出的这种病菌就是鸡、鸭出血性败血症一类病症的病原体。这种病菌在沈阳是由细菌学专家景冠华所查出的。
    （三）在美国飞机投下的大家蝇中查出了伤寒杆菌。这类病菌是严重危害人类的伤寒病的病原体。实验的样品是三月十五日夜间美国飞机在沈阳市扬武街东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近投下的。检验人是细菌学专家景冠华。
    （四）在美国飞机投下的粪蝇和摇蚊中查出了伤寒及副伤寒杆菌。实验的样品是美国飞机在锦州市第五区和第六区投下的。细菌学专家景冠华在粪蝇身上查出了副伤寒杆菌；在摇蚊身上查出了伤寒杆菌。
    （五）在美国飞机投下的黑跳虫身上查出了立克次氏体。这是严重危害人类的斑疹伤寒、珞玑山斑点热等一类病症的病原体。实验的样品是美国飞机在沈阳市旧站区旧站村投下的。检验人是细菌学专家朱既明、魏文彬。
    （六）在美国飞机所投下的冬大蚊中查出了一种急性脑炎的病毒。自三月九日起，在鞍山及其他城市，因急性脑炎致死者，已有多起。经专家们的检验证明，这种脑炎症是我国从未发现过的。专家们的检验又证明，在发现这种脑炎的鞍山等地，美国飞机所投下的冬大蚊所带有的病毒对于小白鼠所造成的病理变化，与这种脑炎症完全相同。这种脑炎病毒，是由李佩琳、许英魁、朱既明、张学德、吴执中，景冠华等六位专家所判明的。
    中国的自然科学各科学家们正在继续进行检验和研究工作，他们必能全部地揭发美国侵略者所使用的各种类型的细菌战、生物战武器。
    根据以上的事实，我们得出了以下结论，即：
    第一、美国政府已经有计划地大规模地使用军用飞机侵略我们伟大的自由独立的祖国——中华人民共和国。美国政府的这种大规模的侵略行动，现在仍然继续进行着。
    第二、侵入中华人民共和国神圣领空的美国军用飞机，不仅进行轰炸扫射，而且有计划地大规模地使用了为人类良心和国际公法及国际公约所禁止的细菌战。生物战武器。如上所述，美国飞机已经侵入中国东北各地，利用细菌弹及其他细菌毒虫的容器，撒布了大量的带有脑炎病毒和伤寒、副伤寒、斑疹伤寒、炭疽病、出血性败血病等类病菌的各种昆虫及其他媒介物体。美国侵略者使用细菌战、生物战武器的目的，就是企图大量地杀害中国的和平人民，毁灭中国的家畜、家禽和农作物。美国政府的这种野蛮侵略行为，现在仍然继续进行着。
    第三、美国政府对中华人民共和国所进行的上述灭绝人性的侵略暴行，是偷偷摸摸地进行的，是一种特别卑鄙龌龊、特别下流无耻的强盗式的侵略行为。
    第四、美国政府对中华人民共和国所进行的上述野蛮卑鄙侵略行为，不但犯了侵略罪，而且犯了违反人道罪和破坏国际公法和战争法规罪。美国政府对中华人民共和国使用细菌战武器的这种侵略战争行动，彻底地破坏了一八九九年和一九○七年海牙公约关于“禁止使用有毒武器”的规定，和一九二五年签订而为世界绝大多数国家所批准的因而已成为文明人类所公认的日内瓦议定书中关于“禁止使用细菌武器”的规定。
    第五、基于以上各点，美国政府使用细菌战武器进行强盗式的侵略，不仅构成了对中国人民和朝鲜人民的严重威胁，而且构成了对人类正义、文明和世界和平的严重威胁，构成了对全人类的严重威胁。
    我们庄严地斥责美国政府和美国军界要人，如像艾奇逊、李奇微之流抵赖他们进行细菌战罪行责任的那种无耻企图。我们实地调查所获得的大量确凿而无可抵赖的证据，已经彻底地驳倒了他们的狡辩和抵赖。上述各项颠扑不破的事实，充分证明美国政府和美国侵略军队负责人对于他们自己万恶罪行的抵赖，是一种极端可鄙的强盗流氓行径。
    我们向全中国人民和全世界爱好和平和自由的人民郑重地呼吁：立即团结一致地行动起来，制止美国侵略者向中朝人民进行毁灭人道的细菌战的暴行。我们要求把进行细菌战的美国政府和美国军队的负责人以及美国科学界中那些丧尽天良的败类，列为战争罪犯，交由世界人民公审，使他们受到严厉惩办。
    我们坚决相信：美国侵略者所进行的万恶的细菌战，是能够被我们战胜的。我们在过去半个月之内亲眼看到了东北各地的人民在毛泽东的旗帜下，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，已经组成了坚强、巨大的人民反细菌战的战线。自然科学各科专家和东北地区广大的人民群众，已经紧密地团结起来，发扬了高度的智慧、创造性、警惕性、和英勇斗争的爱国主义精神，因而有效地扑灭了和扑灭着美国所撒布的细菌毒虫，使美国细菌战武器直到现在不能够发生他们所预期的效果。这种令人鼓舞的事实，使我们十分有把握地认定：只要我们全中国的爱国同胞在毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下继续团结起来，一致努力，并和全世界爱好和平与正义的人民团结起来一致努力，美帝国主义所进行的罪恶滔天的细菌战必将被我们彻底粉碎。
