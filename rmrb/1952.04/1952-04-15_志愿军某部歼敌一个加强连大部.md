Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 14th: On March 18th at 00:15, fighters of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Western Front, with boundless hatred for the American aggressors, launched a counterattack against enemy troops on two unnamed hills northwest of Gorangp'o-ri, and in a fifteen-minute battle, annihilated most of a reinforced company of the Rhee Syngman puppet army.

Since the American invading army began bacteriological warfare in Korea, the volunteer fighters on this front have personally witnessed the Americans using planes and artillery shells to spread flies, crickets, leaves, and chicken feathers containing bacteria on nine separate occasions. The enemy's heinous crimes have enraged the fighters. Fighters have submitted petitions to the command, requesting that the superiors order a counterattack against the enemy in front. The Eighth Company, which was awarded the honorary title of "Steel Company Defending Kaesong," wrote in its petition: "We are the defenders of human civilization and must not allow beasts to use inhuman bacteriological weapons at will. We request to severely punish the wicked enemy!"

Every fighter participating in the counterattack was motivated by such vengeful anger to eliminate the enemy. After the battle began, our army's fierce artillery fire quickly destroyed the enemy's fortifications. The enemy's artillery group only fired three shells in retaliation before being silenced. Platoon leader Zhang Xifa, without waiting to blow up the second barbed wire fence, led his warriors over it with boards. Five enemies in the traffic trench who attempted to resist stubbornly were killed by several hand grenades thrown by the warriors. An enemy soldier squatting in a half-collapsed fortification, frightened and dazed, was kicked down by ammunition handler Lu Guohe, who seized his gun. Fighter Huang Wende swiftly rushed to the enemy's air raid shelter and killed the enemies inside with hand grenades. Machine gunner Wang Wencai suppressed the enemy's heavy machine gun fire, and fighter Bai Feng took the opportunity to rush over, killing the enemy machine gunner and seizing the machine gun. The warriors charged back and forth on the enemy's position, killing, wounding, and capturing 156 enemies in just fifteen minutes, and seizing many spoils of war.

    志愿军某部歼敌一个加强连大部
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】三月十八日零时十五分，西线志愿军某部战士们怀着对美国侵略者的无比仇恨，向高浪浦里西北两个无名高地的敌军发起反击，在十五分钟的战斗中一举歼灭了李承晚伪军一个加强连的大部。
    自从美国侵略军在朝鲜进行细菌战以来，在这一线阵地上的志愿军战士们，已经先后九次亲眼看到美国用飞机和炮弹撒布带有细菌的苍蝇、蟋蟀、树叶和鸡毛等。敌人的万恶罪行激怒了战士们。战士们把一份份的请战书送到了指挥部，请求上级下令向当面的敌人进行反击。荣膺“保卫开城的钢铁连队”光荣称号的第八连在请战书上写道：“我们是人类文明的保卫者，决不能容许野兽们任意使用惨无人道的细菌武器。我们请求狠狠地惩罚万恶的敌人！”
    参加反击战的每一个战士都是怀着这样复仇的怒火去消灭敌人。战斗发起以后，我军猛烈的炮火迅速摧毁了敌人的防御工事，敌人的炮群仅仅还击了三发炮弹，就被打得寂然无声。突击班长张喜发没等炸开第二道铁丝网，就带领着勇士们撑着板跳了过去。交通沟里五个企图顽抗的敌人，被勇士们扔出的几颗手雷打死。一个蹲在半塌的工事里吓得发楞的敌人，被弹药手芦国和一脚踢倒，把枪夺了下来。战士黄文德敏捷地冲到敌人的防炮洞旁，用手雷炸死了洞内的敌人。机枪手王文才把敌人的重机枪火力压住了，战士白凤便乘机冲过去，把敌人的机枪手打死，夺得了机枪。勇士们在敌人阵地上冲过来，杀过去，仅仅十五分钟就打死打伤俘虏敌人一百五十六名，并缴获了许多战利品。
