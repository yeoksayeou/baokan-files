The rampant offensive of the bourgeoisie against the revolutionary camp has been proven by countless facts across the country. Here, I want to use the materials from Andong City to study why the bourgeoisie was able to launch such a successful and smooth offensive. This may be helpful for all regions to summarize experiences and lessons.

(I)

In the past three years, the bourgeoisie in Andong City has launched a comprehensive and rampant offensive against the revolutionary ranks. They have, in an organized and planned way, sabotaged the sacred cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and secretly harmed the Chinese People's Volunteers. The automobile repair factories and auto parts stores in Andong City have formed huge theft gangs, stealing large quantities of the Volunteers' automobiles, auto parts, and gasoline, directly undermining the transportation work at the front. Last year, the Andong City Public Security Bureau uncovered more than 80 cases of stealing military supplies. The Lu Da Automobile Repair Factory alone stole automobiles, gasoline, and other items from the Volunteers, totaling 1.4 billion yuan. All military supplies in the hands of private merchants in Andong City were stolen from the Volunteers. It was also common practice for profiteering pharmacists to sell fake medicines to the Volunteers, and for food merchants to adulterate food when processing it for the Volunteers.

The bourgeoisie in Andong City cut corners and used inferior materials in the construction of national defense projects, stealing a large amount of national wealth and seriously undermining the cause of national defense construction.

The bourgeoisie in Andong City systematically planted 89 "spies" in the state-owned commercial departments. Some capitalists even infiltrated themselves to steal. They usurped leadership in many departments, stole national economic intelligence, and monopolized the market. They tried every possible means to infiltrate state industrial institutions, or to drag state industrial cadres down, in order to usurp the leadership of state industries and achieve their goal of large-scale theft. Several seriously illegal electrical machinery factories in Andong City made their fortunes entirely by stealing state timber. Some factories had all their assets derived from stealing state property.

In order to escape the sanctions of the people's law, the law-breaking capitalists in Andong City also launched a rampant offensive against the state power organs. Some departments of the People's Government have deteriorated and become paralyzed. More than ten judicial workers in the Andong City People's Court have become lackeys of the bourgeoisie, lightly dismissing 78 cases of capitalists harming the state and the people. The detective team of the Public Security Bureau has become the "bodyguard team" for smugglers and drug traffickers. Profiteers have seized the leadership of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Andong People's Customs, turning the Anti-Smuggling Section into a "Smuggling Section" to cover up the profiteers. The Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau and other units also have "spies" sent in or pulled over by the bourgeoisie, covering up the illegal activities of law-breaking capitalists. In the grassroots organizations of the state power – the street administrative organizations – capitalists also tried every possible means to infiltrate, using their powers to act as overlords. Among the 556 administrative group leaders in the Central District, 256 were law-breaking bourgeois elements.

While launching an offensive against the state, the bourgeoisie in Andong City also subjected workers in private enterprises to barbaric insults, beatings, threats, and inducements. This was almost a universal phenomenon. They shouted slogans of obeying the leadership of the working class, but in reality, they treated workers as their slaves.

(II)

Why was the bourgeoisie able to launch such a rampant offensive? This requires checking the leading ideology of the Party and government organs.

For three years, we have been almost blind to the changes in class relations in Andong City. Even though it was clear that the bourgeoisie was launching a rampant offensive, we always regarded it as an "isolated incident" and turned a blind eye. Many comrades only emphasized the aspect of unity with the bourgeoisie, forgetting that in order to achieve true unity, appropriate struggles must be carried out. As a result, we made principled errors on several major policy issues.

First, this was reflected in the labor policy. We did not seriously mobilize the workers and shop assistants in private enterprises to strike at the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. The government labor departments also did not resolutely rely on workers and shop assistants to implement the Trade Union Law and labor protection policies, but relied more on the capitalists to "implement" government orders, often blaming "workers for being too left-leaning" and "workers for being backward." In handling labor-capital dispute cases caused by the bourgeoisie's offensive, they often sided with the capitalists and attacked the workers who were under attack.

Second, there were also errors in the industrial and commercial policy. Our comrades in the Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not see the dangerous tendency of illegal industrial and commercial households breaking away from the leadership of the state-owned economy and developing blindly. They even mistakenly regarded it as a "success" in implementing the industrial and commercial policy. They did not give due blows to the bourgeoisie's reactionary acts of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. Instead, they organized the capitalists under the pretext of "facilitating management," which facilitated their confrontation with the state-owned economy. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce even handed over the power to decide prices to the capitalists. Many trade associations have made reactionary decisions to manipulate prices, but the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce approved them indiscriminately. The conservative hoarding mentality of state-owned enterprise cadres in business operations has also expanded the position of illegal activities by private merchants.

Third, there were also errors in taxation. Although we verbally called for industrial tax rates to be lower than commercial tax rates, and tax rates for stationary merchants to be lower than those for itinerant merchants, the actual implementation resulted in industrial tax rates being higher than commercial tax rates, and tax rates for stationary merchants being higher than those for itinerant merchants. As a result, this objectively fueled the speculative activities of illegal capitalists.

Insufficient understanding and strict management of the nature of private industrialists and merchants and their illegal acts also gave law-breaking capitalists loopholes to evade taxes. Some people, blinded by the cunning and hypocritical face of the capitalists, mistakenly praised the "enlightenment" of a major thief in the newspaper and even presented a "glorious plaque" to a major thief.

Fourth, many cases judged by the People's Court were simply condoning the illegal acts of the bourgeoisie. For example, the bourgeois elements who were sent to state-owned factories to steal more than ten pieces of state secrets were not given due punishment, which objectively encouraged lawbreakers.

The emergence of these errors is not only due to the serious bureaucracy of our leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, but also to the serious right-leaning ideology. In order to defeat the rampant offensive of the bourgeoisie, it is necessary to liquidate the right-leaning ideology of certain leading cadres in order to draw a clear class line.

(III)

Some of our comrades dare not counterattack or struggle in the face of the bourgeoisie's large-scale offensive against the working class. They believe that if the workers rise up to fight against the law-breaking capitalists, it will affect the capitalists' enthusiasm. This idea encouraged the offensive of the law-breaking capitalists. Two issues should be clarified here: One is whether giving up the struggle can encourage the capitalists' enthusiasm? Generally speaking, giving up the struggle can only encourage capitalists to engage in illegal activities and cannot truly encourage their business enthusiasm. This has been proven by a large number of facts revealed in the "Five-Anti" movement. Another question is: If illegal profits do encourage some capitalists to expand reproduction, is it correct? We believe that this is also wrong. Because this is an unlimited development of private capitalism, the result of which will make New Democracy deteriorate. Therefore, if a capitalist has committed an illegal act, he must be resolutely sanctioned. Allowing him to break the law and allowing him to undermine the Common Program is a right-leaning error.

Some comrades' general slogan of "developing private industry and commerce" is wrong. The Common Program clearly stipulates:

"The People's Government shall encourage the positive aspects of all private economic enterprises beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and shall assist their development." (Article 30 of the Common Program)

"All legal public and private trade shall be protected. A system of control shall be enforced over foreign trade and a protective trade policy shall be adopted. Freedom of domestic trade shall be established within the unified national economic plan, but speculation and manipulation for profiteering which disrupt the market shall be strictly prohibited. ... Social capital floating about and commercial capital not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood shall be guided towards investment in industry and other productive enterprises." (Article 37 of the Common Program)

"Financial enterprises shall be subject to strict state control. ... Speculation and manipulation for profiteering which disrupt the state financial undertakings shall be strictly prohibited." (Article 39 of the Common Program)

The above articles all show that private economy has aspects that are allowed to develop and aspects that are prohibited from developing. All private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are allowed to exist and develop, and the People's Government will provide support. All private industrial and commercial enterprises that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are not allowed to develop. The policy of our Party and the People's Government towards private industry and commerce is not to allow them to develop freely without discrimination, but to "enable various social economic components to cooperate with each other and each to play its part under the leadership of the state-owned economy, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy." Therefore, even private economic enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood must obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and the state production plan, and must carry out activities within the scope stipulated by government laws and regulations. They must never be allowed to engage in illegal activities. As Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai said at the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on January 5:

"If someone violates the Common Program and state policies and laws, and resists the leadership of the state-owned economy and the state production plan, it runs counter to the New Democratic economy."

(IV)

Some of our comrades do not understand that state-owned enterprises are enterprises of a socialist nature, and that capitalists are absolutely not allowed to take over the leadership of state-owned enterprises. These comrades mistakenly confuse the socialist state-owned economy with the state capitalist economy of public-private joint ventures. Some people even invited a capitalist to a certain public factory and gave them the power to manage the factory. The workers protested and said: "Why let the capitalist be the director of the working class's own factory?" The workers wanted to drive this capitalist out of the factory, which is the correct attitude of the working class to be seriously responsible to the country. However, our leading comrades not only did not support the workers' reasonable demands, but instead asked the secretary of the Party branch of the factory to convene a meeting of workers to restore the "prestige" of this capitalist who was firmly opposed by the workers, and criticized the workers' just demands as "too left-leaning." Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm for production was severely hit.

Some of our comrades do not see the superiority of the socialist economic system. They do not operate enterprises and manage factories according to the socialist principle of leading production, but rely more on this capitalist to manage the factory with capitalist management methods, on the grounds that this capitalist "has experience in managing factories." Instead, they rely on the working class, strengthen the class education of workers, improve workers' sense of ownership, give play to workers' enthusiasm and creativity in production, and implement democratic management.

What is this capitalist's experience in managing factories?

The capitalist's only experience is to use all means to turn this public factory into his private property. He fantasized that once the conditions were ripe, he would seize the entire factory. When the Korean War was in full swing in the winter of 1950, this capitalist thought he could take the opportunity and actively prepared to seize the factory. Unfortunately, this capitalist completely miscalculated the situation of the Korean War. The victory news on the Korean battlefield shattered this capitalist's fantasy. The attempt to seize it openly failed, so he used various despicable means to undermine the development of the factory. In addition to stealing a large amount of factory property, he also cultivated personal forces in the factory, spread cronies, carried out provocation and discord, and undermined the prestige of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union among the workers. He said to the workers: "When I used to run the factory, there were no Party, Communist Youth League, or trade union organizations, and I still completed the production tasks. What is the use of these organizations?" He wanted to completely seize the workers into his hands, so that the working class would lose the leadership of the Party and would always be in a state of ignorance.

The capitalist's business activities are to make the public enterprise obey the requirements of the private enterprise, and to try to turn the socialist public enterprise into an appendage of private capitalism.

Isn't this directly handing over the leadership of the national economy to the capitalists? Although there are not many such intolerable right-leaning elements in Andong City, there is more than one. Such right-leaning thoughts and behaviors must be thoroughly liquidated.

(V)

We have not assumed the responsibility of leadership for private enterprises and the workers in private enterprises. There is an extremely serious state of laissez-faire. Many workers have not received basic education.

I once talked to a female cadre in a private enterprise trade union. The content of the conversation is as follows:

Question: How do capitalists treat workers?

Answer: Capitalists actively lead workers to study.

Question: What to study?

Answer: Study politics, study culture, study technology.

Question: Why are capitalists so "enthusiastic" about workers' studies?

Answer: In order to improve workers' class consciousness, cultural level, and technical level.

Question: What is the purpose?

Answer: Labor-capital mutual benefit, development of production.

Question: Do workers agree to let capitalists lead them to study?

Answer: Workers are too backward and unwilling to participate in learning.

Question: Why doesn't the trade union organize workers to study?

Answer: …………………………

Question: What is the workers' class consciousness?

Answer: ………………

This comrade depicted the capitalists as completely like communists; while the workers who were unwilling to accept the deceptive education of the capitalists were slandered as "too backward." Her class stance was blurred to an alarming degree!

Comrade Kalinin wrote in "On Communist Education":

"The capitalist's ideal is to treat workers and peasants as his own, as slaves who are willing to bear the burden of exploitation and obey orders. Therefore, capitalists are originally unwilling to educate workers and peasants to have a spirit of bravery, and are originally unwilling to let them gain any knowledge. You must know that dark and ignorant people are very easy to deal with." He also said: "Without basic knowledge, these people cannot work next to the machine. … This forces the bourgeoisie to allow laborers to obtain at least a smattering of knowledge." This is the real purpose of why the bourgeoisie organizes workers to study. The so-called education is to inject the poisons of the bourgeoisie's world view and moral habits into the ideological consciousness of the working masses, making the workers his slaves.

From the conversation of this female comrade, it is also clear that there are serious problems in the workers' movement in private enterprises in Andong City. For several years, we have rarely or even not carried out class education and socialist future education among private enterprise workers. Some of our comrades dare not say that "the trade union is a communist school." We have not organized and educated workers to carry out resolute struggles against the bourgeoisie's illegal activities of bribery, shoddy workmanship, theft of state assets, tax evasion, and theft of state economic intelligence in order to protect national interests, which objectively recognizes the legitimacy of the capitalists' theft.

This is tantamount to disarming the working class and encouraging the bourgeoisie to attack the working class.

We should and must take responsibility to carry out socialist and communist ideological education to the working class, and cultivate an unbreakable belief in fighting for socialism and communism in the ideological consciousness of the working masses.

We should and must take responsibility to carry out specific class education to the working class, so that workers can understand the nature of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of profit, harm to others and benefit to themselves, and speculation; let workers understand that the bourgeoisie's illegal activities of bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets are an attack on the working class, seriously harming the long-term interests of the working class and seriously endangering the country. Call on the working class to act bravely, and at present, concentrate its efforts to suppress the offensive of the bourgeoisie, and in the future, always pay attention to the dynamics of the bourgeoisie and prepare to strike at the illegal activities of the bourgeoisie at any time, in order to protect the current and long-term interests of the state and the working class.

We should and must take responsibility to educate workers to supervise and lead capitalists, earnestly and correctly implement the policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and prospering the economy," in order to give play to the certain positive aspects of private capitalism. Under the leadership of the national economy, we will strive to build our great motherland.

(VI)

Some of our comrades, in the long-term work of the united front, in the long-term contact with the representatives of the bourgeoisie (this is necessary and inevitable), could not withstand the bourgeoisie's praise, accepted the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and therefore did not see the bourgeoisie's nature of pursuing profit, harming others and benefiting themselves, and speculation, forgetting that they are representatives of the bourgeoisie, forgetting that they are figures who represent the interests of the bourgeoisie and are engaged in activities, naively hoping that the representatives of the bourgeoisie can still maintain their economic status and establish the ideology of the proletariat.

These comrades completely forgot the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, and forgot or abolished the theory of class struggle. They believe that in the new democratic country where the proletariat has already grasped the leadership, the bourgeoisie will naturally accept and obey the political leadership and ideological leadership of the proletariat, and even think that the bourgeoisie will also accept communist ideas, and join hands with the working class to enter the socialist society and communist society in love.

This anti-Marxist-Leninist idea that cancels class struggle and believes that the bourgeoisie can establish the ideology of the proletariat has been shattered by the current facts of sharp class struggle.

Of course, in the entire process of the New Democratic Revolution in our country, private capitalism must be allowed to exist and its certain positive aspects must be used; but in order not to be defeated by the bourgeoisie in cooperation with the bourgeoisie, and in order to consolidate the leadership of the working class, the rampant offensive of the bourgeoisie must be resolutely defeated at present; possible offensives of the bourgeoisie should also be strictly prevented in the future. In the current and future struggles, the resolute and thorough elimination of right-leaning ideas within the Party has its decisive significance.

    安东市资产阶级的猖狂进攻给了我们什么教训
    中共安东市委书记　张烈
    资产阶级向革命阵营的猖狂进攻，已为全国各地的无数事实所证明。这里，我要用安东市的材料来研究一下资产阶级为什么能够进攻得这样得手，这样顺利。这对于各地总结经验教训，或有帮助。
    （一）
    近三年来，安东市的资产阶级向革命队伍进行了全面的、猖狂的进攻。他们曾经有组织有计划地破坏抗美援朝的神圣事业，暗害中国人民志愿军。安东市的汽车修理厂和汽车零件商店，结成了巨大的盗窃集团，大量地盗窃志愿军的汽车、汽车零件、汽油，直接破坏前方的运输工作。去年安东市公安机关破获的偷盗军需物资案件，达八十余件。仅陆大汽车修理厂就盗窃志愿军的汽车、汽油等共值十四亿元。安东市私商手里的所有军用物资，都是从志愿军那里盗窃来的。药房的奸商卖给志愿军假药，食品商在给志愿军的食品加工时掺杂，也是平常的事。
    安东市的资产阶级，在承建国防工程中偷工减料，以坏报好，盗窃了国家大量财富，严重地破坏了国防建设事业。
    安东市的资产阶级，有计划地在国家商业部门安插了八十九个“坐探”。有的资本家更亲自钻进来进行盗窃。他们在很多部门篡夺了领导权，盗窃国家经济情报，垄断市场。他们千方百计地钻入国家工业机构，或把国家工业干部拉下水去，篡夺国家工业的领导权，以遂其大量盗窃的目的。安东市几家严重违法的电机制材厂，完全是靠盗窃国家木材发家的。有的工厂，全部财产都是从盗窃国家财产得来的。
    安东市的违法资本家为逃脱人民法律的制裁，向国家政权机关也举行了猖狂的进攻。人民政府某些部门已经变质，瘫痪了。安东市人民法院有十多个司法工作者变成了资产阶级的走卒，曾把七十八起资本家危害国家和人民的案件轻轻放过。公安部门的侦缉队，变成了奸商走私贩毒分子的“保镳队”。奸商们窃取了安东人民海关缉私科的领导权，缉私科变成了掩护奸商的“走私科”。市人民政府税务局及其他单位，都有资产阶级派进来或拉过去的“坐探”，掩护违法资本家进行罪恶的活动。在国家政权的基层组织——街道行政组织中，资本家也千方百计地钻进来，利用职权，作威作福。中央区五百五十六个行政组长中，就有二百五十六名是资产阶级违法分子。
    安东市的资产阶级在向国家发动进攻的同时，对私营企业中的工人也进行着野蛮的侮辱，打骂，威胁，利诱。这几乎是普遍的现象。他们口里喊着服从工人阶级领导，实际上是把工人当做他们的奴隶。
    （二）
    资产阶级为什么能够这样猖狂进攻呢？这须要从党、政机关的领导思想上来作检查。
    三年来，我们对安东市阶级关系的变化，几乎是熟视无睹的。明明是资产阶级在猖狂进攻，却总认为是“个别事件”，听之任之。许多同志只强调对资产阶级团结的一面，而忘记了为达到真正的团结，必须进行适当的斗争。因之，我们在若干重大政策问题上犯了带原则性的错误。
    首先表现在劳动政策上。我们没有认真地发动私营企业中的工人、店员起来打击资产阶级的气焰，政府劳动部门也没有坚决地依靠工人、店员来贯彻工会法和劳动保护的政策，而是更多的依靠资本家去“贯彻”政令，经常地责备“工人太左”，“工人落后”。在处理由于资产阶级的进攻所引起的劳资纠纷案件时，多偏袒资本家，打击被进攻的工人。
    其次，在工商政策上也有错误。我们工商局的同志看不到违法工商户脱离国营经济领导而盲目发展的危险倾向，甚至错误地认为是执行工商政策的“成功”。对资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等反动行为，没有给予应有的打击，反而藉口“便于管理”，把资本家们组织起来，便利了他们和国营经济对抗。市工商局甚至把物价的决定权交给了资本家。许多同业公会曾做出操纵物价的反动决定，市工商局竟不分青红皂白地予以批准。国家企业干部在业务经营上的保守惜售思想，也扩大了私商非法活动的阵地。
    第三，在税收方面也有错误。我们口头上虽然喊工业税率应低于商业税率，座商的税率应低于行商的税率；但实际执行的结果，却是工业的税率高于商业的税率，座商的税率高于行商的税率。因而在客观上助长了违法资本家的投机倒把活动。
    对私营工商业者的本质及其违法行为了解不够，管理不严，也给了违法资本家偷税漏税的空隙。有的人因被资本家狡猾伪善的面目所蒙蔽，曾错误地在报纸上渲染过大盗窃犯的“开明”，并曾向大盗窃犯赠送过“光荣匾”。
    第四，人民法院所判决的许多案件，简直是在纵容资产阶级的违法行为。如对资产阶级派到国营工厂中盗窃国家机密十余件的分子，没有给以应有的惩罚，客观上是鼓励了违法者。
    这些错误的产生，不仅是由于我们各级领导机关及领导干部有着严重的官僚主义，而且由于有着严重的右倾思想。为了把资产阶级的猖狂进攻打下去，清算一下某些领导干部的右倾思想，以划清阶级界限，实有必要。
    （三）
    我们有的同志在资产阶级向工人阶级大举进攻的面前，不敢反攻，不敢斗争。他们认为工人们起来向违法资本家进行斗争，会影响资本家的积极性。这种思想，鼓励了违法资本家的进攻。这儿应该弄清两个问题：一个是放弃斗争能不能鼓励资本家的积极性？一般地说，放弃斗争只能鼓励资本家进行违法活动，并不能真正鼓励其经营积极性，这已经被“五反”运动中所揭发的大量事实所证明。另一个问题是：如果非法利润确实鼓舞了某些资本家去扩大再生产的话，是不是正确的呢？我们认为，这也是错误的。因为这是无限制地发展私人资本主义，其结果会使新民主主义变质。所以，资本家如有犯法行为，就必须坚决予以制裁。任其犯法，任其破坏共同纲领，就是右倾错误。
    有的同志一般地提出“发展私营工商业”的口号，是错误的。共同纲领明确地规定：
    “凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”（共同纲领第三十条）
    “保护一切合法的公私贸易。实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策。在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。……引导社会游资及无益于国计民生的商业资本投入工业及其他生产事业。”（共同纲领第三十七条）
    “金融事业应受国家严格管理。……凡进行金融投机、破坏国家金融事业者，应受严厉制裁。”（共同纲领第三十九条）
    以上各条，都说明私营经济有被容许发展的方面，也有被禁止发展的方面。凡有利于国计民生的私营工商业，就允许其存在和发展，人民政府并加以扶植。凡不利于国计民生的私营工商业，就不允许其发展。我党及人民政府对于私营工商业的政策，不是不分青红皂白地无限制地任其自由发展，而是“使各种社会经济成分在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展”。因此，即便是有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，也必须服从国营经济和国家生产计划的领导，必须在政府的法令所规定的范围之内进行活动，决不能允许他们有违法活动。正如一月五日周恩来副主席在人民政协全国委员会常务委员会上所讲的：
    “如果有人违背共同纲领和国家政策法令，抵抗国营经济和国家生产计划的领导，那是与新民主主义的经济背道而驰。”
    （四）
    我们有的同志不明白国营企业是社会主义性质的企业，不明白国营企业中绝对不许可由资本家掌握领导权。这些同志错误地把社会主义性质的国营经济和公私合营的国家资本主义经济混同起来。有的人竟将一个资本家请到某公营工厂里来，并交给他们以管理工厂的大权。工人们抗议说：“工人阶级自己的工厂，为什么让资本家当厂长？”工人们要驱逐这个资本家出工厂去，这是工人阶级对国家认真负责的正确态度。而我们的领导同志不仅不支持工人的合理要求，反而要求工厂党的支部书记召集工人开会，来挽回这个为工人所坚决反对的资本家的“威信”。并且批评工人们的正义要求为“过左”。因此，工人们的生产积极性受到了严重的打击。
    我们有的同志看不到社会主义性质的经济制度的优越性。他们不是按着社会主义的领导生产的原则来经营企业和进行工厂管理，不是依靠工人阶级，加强对工人的阶级教育，提高工人主人翁的感觉，发挥工人的生产积极性和创造性，实行民主的经营管理；而是更多地去依靠这个资本家用资本主义的经营方法来管理工厂，理由是这个资本家“有管理工厂的经验”。
    这个资本家管理工厂的经验是什么呢？
    这个资本家的唯一的经验，是用尽一切方法把这个公营工厂变成他的私有财产。他幻想一旦条件成熟时，就把整个的工厂夺过去。当一九五零年冬天朝鲜战争正在紧张进行的时候，这个资本家以为有机可乘，便积极地做夺取工厂的准备工作。可惜，这个资本家把朝鲜战争形势完全估计错了。朝鲜战场上的胜利消息，打碎了这个资本家的幻想。公开夺取的企图失败了，他便用各种卑劣的手段来破坏这个工厂的发展。除大批地盗窃工厂的财产外，更在工厂中培植私人势力，广布亲信，进行挑拨离间，破坏党、团、工会在工人群众中的威信。他对工人们说：“我过去经营工厂的时候就没有党、团、工会的组织，一样地完成生产任务。这些组织有什么用处？”他想把工人完全夺取到他的手里，使工人阶级失掉党的领导，而永远处于愚昧无知的状态。
    这个资本家的业务活动，是极力使公营企业服从私营企业的要求，力图使社会主义性质的公营企业变为私人资本主义的附属物。
    这不是把国家经济的领导权直接交给资本家了吗？这类不能容忍的右倾分子，在安东市虽然为数不多，但也不止一个。似此右倾的思想和行为，是必须加以彻底清算的。
    （五）
    对于私营企业和私营企业中的工人，我们没有负起领导的责任来。那里存在着极端严重的自流状态。许多工人没有受到起码的教育。
    我曾和一位私营企业工会中的女干部谈过话，谈话内容如下：
    问：资本家怎样对待工人呢？
    答：资本家积极地领导工人学习。
    问：学习什么？
    答：学习政治，学习文化，学习技术。
    问：资本家为什么对工人的学习这样的“热心”呢？
    答：为了提高工人的阶级觉悟、文化水平和技术水平。
    问：到底是为了什么？
    答：劳资两利，发展生产。
    问：工人们同意让资本家来领导他们学习吗？
    答：工人太落后，不愿参加学习。
    问：工会为什么不组织工人学习呢？
    答：…………………………
    问：什么是工人的阶级觉悟？
    答：………………
    这个同志把资本家描画得完全像一个共产主义者；而对于不愿接受资本家欺骗教育的工人，则诬为“太落后”。她的阶级立场模糊到了惊人的程度！
    加里宁同志在“论共产主义教育”一文中写道：
    “资本家的理想就是要把工人和农民当作自己的，甘受剥削重担，唯命是听的奴仆。因此，资本家本来不愿教育工农具有勇敢精神，本来不愿让他们得到任何知识。要知道，黑暗无知的人，他们是很容易对付的。”又说：“若没有起码的知识，这些人就不能在机器旁边作工。……便迫使资产阶级不能不让劳动者至少获得微末的知识。”这就是资产阶级为什么组织工人学习的真正目的。所谓教育，也就是把资产阶级的世界观和道德习惯等等的毒素，注射到工人群众的思想意识中去，使工人变成他的奴仆。
    从这位女同志的谈话中，也明显地暴露了安东市私营企业中工人运动存在着严重的问题。数年来，我们很少甚至没有在私营企业工人中进行过阶级教育和社会主义前途教育。我们有的同志不敢讲“工会是共产主义的学校”。对于资产阶级的行贿、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、偷税漏税、盗窃国家经济情报的违法行为，我们没有组织和教育工人去进行坚决的斗争，以保护国家利益，这在客观上是承认了资本家的盗窃行为的合法。
    这就无异于解除了工人阶级的武装，鼓励资产阶级向工人阶级进攻。
    我们应该而且必须负起责任来，向工人阶级进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，在工人群众的思想意识中培植起为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的牢不可破的信念。
    我们应该而且必须负起责任来，向工人阶级进行具体的阶级教育，让工人们明白资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质；让工人们明白资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财等违法行为是向工人阶级进攻，是严重地损害工人阶级的长远利益和严重地危害国家的行为。号召工人阶级勇敢地行动起来，在目前，集中力量把资产阶级的进攻压下去，在今后，时时注视资产阶级的动态，准备随时打击资产阶级的违法行为，以保护国家及工人阶级的目前的及长远的利益。
    我们应该而且必须负起责任来，教育工人，去监督和领导资本家，认真地正确地执行“公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济”的政策，以发挥私人资本主义一定的积极性。在国家经济的领导下，为建设我们伟大的祖国而努力。

    我们有少数同志，在较长期的统一战线工作中，在和资产阶级的代表人物较长期的接触（这是必要的、不可避免的）中，经不起资产阶级的捧场，接受了资产阶级的思想影响，因而看不到资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，忘记了他们是资产阶级的代表，忘记了他们是代表着资产阶级的利益而活动的人物，天真地希望资产阶级的代表们仍然保持他们的经济地位而能树立无产阶级的思想。
    这些同志完全忘记了马克思列宁主义的根本原则，忘记或取消了阶级斗争的理论。他们认为在无产阶级已经掌握了领导权的新民主主义国家里，资产阶级会自然而然地接受和服从无产阶级的政治领导和思想领导，甚至于以为资产阶级也会接受共产主义的思想，和工人阶级相亲相爱地携手进入社会主义社会和共产主义社会。
    这种取消阶级斗争和认为资产阶级可以树立无产阶级思想的反马列主义的思想，已经被目前尖锐的阶级斗争的事实打碎了。
    当然，我国在新民主主义革命整个进程中，必须允许私人资本主义存在，并运用它一定的积极性；但为了不至于在同资产阶级合作中被资产阶级所击败，为了巩固工人阶级的领导权，目前必须坚决地击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻；今后也应严防资产阶级可能的进攻。在目前和今后的斗争中，坚决而彻底地肃清党内的右倾思想，都有其决定的意义。
