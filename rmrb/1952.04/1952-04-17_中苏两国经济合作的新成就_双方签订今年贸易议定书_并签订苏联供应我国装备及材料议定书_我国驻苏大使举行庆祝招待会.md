Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: As a result of negotiations between the Trade Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding, a trade protocol for 1952 was signed in Moscow on April 12th. The protocol stipulates that supplies from both sides will be greatly increased compared to 1951. Simultaneously, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Soviet Loans to China of February 14, 1950, a protocol was signed this year for the Soviet Union to supply the People's Republic of China with equipment and materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 16th: Zhang Wentian, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, held a reception on the evening of the 14th to celebrate the signing of the 1952 Sino-Soviet Trade Protocol.

Guests invited to the reception included Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko, Soviet Deputy Ministers of Foreign Trade Kuzmin, Pavlov, and Goval, and directors of various departments of the Ministry, Chairman of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce Nesterov, Secretary-General of the International Trade Promotion Committee Chamberland, Head of the Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the International Economic Conference Kuchkov, Head of the Polish Delegation Ranki, Head of the Czechoslovak Delegation Bauer, and envoys of various People's Democratic countries to the Soviet Union.

Chinese attendees included: the Head of the Trade Delegation attending the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations, Sha Qianli, Deputy Head Lin Haiyun and all members of the delegation, the Head of the Chinese Delegation attending the International Economic Conference, Nan Hanchen, and members Lei Renmin and Ji Chaoding.

In his toast at the reception, Ambassador Zhang said: Dear guests, friends!

The signing of the 1952 Sino-Soviet Trade Protocol has made the economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union closer and more consolidated. Please allow me to congratulate our two countries on the new achievements in economic cooperation, and express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin for their concern and generous and selfless assistance to China's economic construction!

Trade between China and the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries has developed rapidly in recent years. This is a kind of international trade within the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, a kind of international trade that is truly developed based on the principles of friendship, cooperation, equality, and mutual benefit between countries. Because the foundation of this international trade is established on the universal upsurge of industry and agriculture in various countries, and the continuous improvement of the cultural and living standards of the people of various countries, its development prospects are unlimited. The Chinese people are very satisfied with the achievements we have made in developing this international trade in the past, and we are full of confidence in its future development prospects. The discriminatory policies, blockades, and embargo policies adopted by American imperialists in international economic relations, just like its war preparations policies, are bound to go completely bankrupt. The principle of equal and mutually beneficial international trade, like our peace policy, is bound to win!

Please allow me to raise a glass in toast to:

The eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live lasting world peace and the friendship of all peoples!

Long live the leader and mentor of progressive humanity in the world, the standard-bearer of peace, and the best friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Stalin!

Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin raised his glass and said: "Please allow me to drink to the prosperity of our friend, the People's Republic of China, to the close economic cooperation between our two countries, to the unbreakable friendship, to the government of the People's Republic of China, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong."

Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko raised his glass and said: "Comrades, please drink to Sino-Soviet friendship, which has in fact proven to be a guarantee of peace in the whole world. Please drink to the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China."

Ambassador Zhang Wentian then raised his glass to congratulate the outstanding Soviet diplomat, the faithful implementer of Stalin's peaceful foreign policy, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, and Deputy Minister Gromyko, and to congratulate the Soviet experts, engineers, and economic workers in various fields of industry, agriculture, and trade who are helping China's economic construction.

Head of the delegation Sha Qianli and Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Pavlov toasted each other's health for the members of both sides participating in the trade negotiations.

The reception proceeded in a friendly atmosphere. Dancing was held after the meeting to add to the festivities, and it ended in joy late into the night.

    中苏两国经济合作的新成就
    双方签订今年贸易议定书
    并签订苏联供应我国装备及材料议定书
    我国驻苏大使举行庆祝招待会
    【新华社十六日讯】中华人民共和国商务代表团和苏联对外贸易部之间在友好和互相了解的气氛中进行谈判的结果，已于四月十二日在莫斯科签订了一九五二年贸易议定书。议定书规定双方的供应比一九五一年大大增加。双方同时根据一九五○年二月十四日中苏关于苏联贷款给中国的协定，签订了今年苏联供应中华人民共和国装备及材料的议定书。
    【新华社莫斯科十六日电】我国驻苏联大使张闻天，为庆祝一九五二年中苏贸易议定书的签订，特于十四日晚举行招待会。
    应邀到会的来宾有苏联对外贸易部部长库米金，苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯，苏联对外贸易部副部长库兹明、巴夫洛夫、戈瓦尔和该部各司司长，全苏商会主席奈斯特洛夫，国际贸易促进委员会秘书长香贝朗，出席国际经济会议的德意志民主共和国代表团团长库赫科夫、波兰代表团团长兰基、捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长鲍尔，和各人民民主国家驻苏使节。
    中国方面到会的有：前来苏联参加中苏贸易谈判的商务代表团团长沙千里、副团长林海云和全体团员，出席国际经济会议的中国代表团团长南汉宸，团员雷任民、冀朝鼎。
    张大使在招待会上举杯致辞说：亲爱的来宾们，朋友们！
    一九五二年中苏贸易议定书的签字，使中苏两国的经济合作更加密切和巩固起来了。请允许我庆贺我们两国在经济合作方面的新成就，并向苏联人民、苏联政府、斯大林同志对于中国经济建设的关怀和慷慨无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢！
    中苏两国及各人民民主国家之间的贸易近年来发展很快。这是和平、民主、社会主义阵营内部的一种国际贸易，是真正根据各国友好、合作、平等、互惠的原则而发展起来的一种国际贸易。由于这种国际贸易的基础建立在各国工、农业的普遍高涨，及各国人民文化、生活水平的不断提高之上，因此它的发展前途是不可限量的。中国人民非常满意于我们过去在发展这方面的国际贸易所得到的成绩，而且对于其将来的发展前途充满着信心。美帝国主义者在国际经济关系方面对于我们所采取的歧视政策、封锁、禁运政策，正像它的备战政策一样，是必然要彻底破产的。平等、互利的国际贸易原则，正像我们的和平政策一样，必然要胜利！
    请允许我举杯敬祝：
    中苏两国永久的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界的持久和平与各族人民的友好万岁！
    世界进步人类的领袖与导师、和平的旗手、中国人民的最好朋友斯大林同志万岁！
    苏联对外贸易部部长库米金举杯说：“请允许我为我们的朋友——中华人民共和国的繁荣、为我们两国之间的密切的经济合作，为牢不可破的友谊，为中华人民共和国政府，为毛泽东同志的健康干杯。”
    苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯举杯说：“同志们，请为苏中友谊干杯，这个友谊事实上已证明是支持全世界和平的保障。请为中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来同志的健康干杯。”
    张闻天大使接着举杯祝贺苏联杰出的外交家、斯大林和平外交政策的忠实执行者、苏联外交部长维辛斯基和副部长葛罗米柯的健康，祝贺帮助中国经济建设的苏联工业、农业、贸易各方面的专家、工程师、经济工作者的健康。
    沙千里团长和苏联对外贸易部副部长巴夫洛夫，互相举杯祝贺参加这次贸易谈判的双方人员的健康。
    招待会在友好的气氛中进行。会后举行跳舞助兴，直至深夜才尽欢而散。
