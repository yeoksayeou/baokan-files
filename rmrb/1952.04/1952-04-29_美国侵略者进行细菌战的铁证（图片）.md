Ironclad Proof of American Aggressors' Germ Warfare

    Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is identifying specimens of insects scattered by American aggressors in Northeast China. Xinhua News Agency reporter Niu Weiyu

    Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Head of the "Investigation Team into the Crimes of Germ Warfare by American Imperialism," is using a magnifying glass to examine small flies scattered by American imperialism, collected by the Volunteer Anti-epidemic Inspection Team, and carrying paratyphoid A bacteria.

    Ducks injected with the above emulsion showed accelerated breathing and listlessness after about seven or eight hours, and died after twelve hours. Xinhua News Agency draft Jiang Hancheng

    Hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella bacteria were obtained by culturing the blood, liver, or other organs of the dead ducks. The picture shows countless Pasteurella bacteria obtained through culture as seen under a microscope. Xinhua News Agency draft Jiang Hancheng

    After the death of the ducks, Hu Zhengxiang, professor of pathology at the Peking Union Medical College, dissected them and found inflammatory exudates on the surface of the liver (a layer of grayish-white membrane), with multiple abscesses inside the liver.

    Bacteriologists grind one type of germ-carrying insect scattered by American planes – spiders – into an emulsion for culturing and injecting into animals for experimentation. Xinhua News Agency draft Jiang Hancheng

    经注射上述乳剂的鸭子，约七八小时后呼吸加快、精神萎靡，十二小时后死亡。    新华社稿蒋汉澄摄
    将死亡鸭子的血、肝脏或其他脏器培养得到出血性败血症巴氏杆菌。图示显微镜下所见的经培养所得的无数巴氏杆菌。新华社稿蒋汉澄摄
    死亡后的鸭子，经中国协和医学院病理科教授胡正祥解剖后，发现肝脏表面有腹膜炎性渗出物（为一层灰白膜），肝内并有多处脓肿。
