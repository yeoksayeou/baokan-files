To the Editor:

    Peasant farmers in most areas of Northern Jiangsu rely on pig farming as their main side occupation. Pig manure is a major fertilizer for farmland. This spring, excessive rain and snow have made it difficult to find pig feed. Since the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movements, local trade companies and merchants have generally been caught up in the movements, and the transportation and sales of live pigs have largely come to a standstill, leading to a daily decline in pig prices in various places. So far, pig prices are generally only half of what they were last winter. For example, in Taixing County, the price of live pigs last winter was about 350,000 yuan per 100 catties, and pork was about 5,500 yuan per catty, while now the price of live pigs has fallen to 200,000 yuan per 100 catties, and pork has fallen to 2,300 yuan per catty. In Yangzhou City, live pigs were 350,000 yuan per 100 catties last winter, and pork was 5,500 to 5,800 yuan, while now there is no market price for live pigs, and pork has fallen to 3,000 to 3,400 yuan per catty. The situation of falling pig prices in other places such as Yancheng and Huaiyin is also very serious. If we compare pork and rice, the ratio of pork to rice in Northern Jiangsu was generally around five to one in the past, but now each catty of pork can only be exchanged for two or three catties of rice, and it is still difficult to sell. This situation has been going on for two months now, and the local government has turned a blind eye to it, thus affecting the enthusiasm of farmers for raising pigs and composting manure. Just when the government is calling on the whole country to accumulate fertilizer and increase the yield per unit area of agriculture, I have the following suggestions for the relevant authorities:

    1. The banking sector should immediately handle pig-raising loans, and the procedures must be simple and the loans must be delivered to households in a timely manner so that farmers can continue to raise pigs.
    2. The native produce companies and cooperative departments should immediately carry out large-scale transportation and sales.
    3. The Northern Jiangsu Financial and Economic Committee and the Agricultural and Forestry Department should organize research on this issue to seek a thorough solution.

    苏北地区各级贸易部门
    应迅速解决猪的销路问题
    编辑同志：苏北大部分地区的农民，以养猪为主要副业。猪粪是农田主要肥料。今年春天雨雪过多，猪食来源不易；反贪污和反盗窃运动开展以后，各地贸易公司和商人都卷入运动，毛猪的运销业务普遍陷于停顿，各地猪价日益下跌。到目前为止，猪价一般仅及去年冬天的一半。如泰兴县去年冬天毛猪价每百斤约三十五万元。猪肉每斤约五千五百元，而现在毛猪价跌到每百斤二十万元，猪肉跌到每斤二千三百元。扬州市去年冬天毛猪每百斤三十五万元，猪肉五千五百元到五千八百元，而现在毛猪则无市价，猪肉跌到每斤三千元至三千四百元。其他如盐城、淮阴等地猪价下跌的情况也很严重。如果把猪肉和大米来比较，苏北地区的猪肉与大米的比例，过去一般都在五比一左右，而现在则每斤
    猪肉只能换到大米二、三斤，而且还不易销售。这种情况，到现在已经有两个月，当地政府竟熟视无睹，因而影响了农民养猪沤肥的情绪。正当政府号召全国积肥、提高农业单位面积产量的时候，我对有关机关有以下几点建议：
    一、银行部门应立即办理养猪贷款，并须做到手续简便，及时贷放到户，使农民能继续养猪。
    二、土产公司和合作社部门，应立即进行大量运销。
    三、苏北财政经济委员会和农林处对这一问题应组织研究，以求得彻底解决。
