    After the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Party Committee of Organs Directly Under the CPC Central Committee North China Bureau summarized the Party's work in various organs and formulated a trial outline for the work of Party branches in the organs.

    Over the past year, the Party Committee of Organs Directly Under the North China Bureau has grasped the important link of continuously improving the Marxist-Leninist level of Party members and has conscientiously led the theoretical and cultural studies of cadres. Experience has proved that this is the most effective way to enhance the combat effectiveness of the Party in the organs and to do a good job in the work of the organs. In the past year, in addition to leading all cadres to complete the study of the General History of China, the current Party Committee invited responsible comrades of the North China Bureau to make timely reports on current affairs and policies, organized the study of Party history around the "July 1st" anniversary, and organized discussions on the film "The Life of Wu Xun" in a more planned way. In addition, it adhered to the system of Party classes and Party days, organized nearly 700 new Party members and non-Party cadres to study the Party Constitution, and organized more than 600 people to participate in amateur cultural studies, completing one to one and a half semesters of curriculum teaching in one year. The Party Committee has also achieved good results in education on current affairs and policies on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In addition to organizing donations and condolences, it also formulated patriotic pacts to improve work efficiency. The work of the organs' Communist Youth League and security work have made great progress compared with the past. Under the direct help of the organs' Party Committee, the organs' Communist Youth League has established twelve branches and a preparatory committee for the League's general branch. All these achievements are mainly the result of the direct leadership of the North China Bureau and the efforts of all Party members.

    However, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the work of the organs' branches over the past year. These are mainly manifested in the poor political and ideological leadership of the organs' branches; insufficient democratic life inside and outside the Party; and the branches have not well organized strict criticism and self-criticism of the petty-bourgeois ideology and liberalism errors existing in Party members. According to the materials exposed in the "Three-Anti" Movement, some Party members were corrupted by the bourgeoisie, some Party members continued to make mistakes in their work, repeatedly embezzled and took advantage of public property, and some comrades were concerned about their status and treatment and were not at ease in doing organ work. This also fully reflects that the Party's organizational life was not strict enough in peacetime, so that bourgeois ideology invaded the Party, and the petty-bourgeois style of the Party was able to exist and rise. Another shortcoming of the organs' branches is that the leadership of the branches of various organs and the directly subordinate Party Committee has bureaucratic problems. Some regular reporting, meeting, and other systems cannot be adhered to. There are delays and backlogs in dealing with the punishment of Party members and the issue of Party membership transfer. In leading some important movements in the organs, the inspection was not timely enough, and it was not possible to further enrich the Party's regular work through the movement. The excellent systems created and established in the movement were not seriously implemented. For example, the patriotic pact later became a mere formality for this reason. In addition, there is insufficient concern for the difficulties in the lives of Party members and cadres in the organs. No concrete suggestions have been put forward and the administrative side has not been supervised to thoroughly solve this problem. Furthermore, the practice of adhering to a hard-working and simple style and the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity have not been seriously advocated among Party members. These shortcomings must be improved in future work.

    The reasons for these shortcomings are mainly: First, the organs' Party Committee has some vague and incorrect concepts about the Party's work in the organs. This is mainly manifested in the fact that some Party Committee members are not responsible enough for the work of the organs' Party Committee, and some even regard the work of the Party Committee as an "extra burden." In the past, the leadership of the Party Committee emphasized that the organs' branches had a large number of Party members, high quality, and strong consciousness, and relaxed leadership. The tasks assigned to the organs' branches were not comprehensive enough, only emphasizing learning, and not regarding regularly understanding the ideological situation of Party members in their work, improving the awareness of Party members, and caring for the lives of Party members as an important task in the life of the branch. Second, the organs' Party Committee has not established regular work, and has not inspected its more than a dozen branches enough. It does not know much about the ideological situation of the cadres in the organs, let alone use typical examples of good and bad Party members to educate the entire Party at any time. Because the leadership has not been able to conduct regular, principled, and clear criticism and praise of erroneous and correct ideas and behaviors, criticism and self-criticism has not become a regular system in the life of the branch, which has weakened the Party's combat effectiveness. Third, the organization of the organs' Party Committee is not sound enough, and the administrative responsible comrades of various departments do not participate. The work of the Party Committee's office is also not strong enough.

    In order to overcome the above shortcomings and further improve the efficiency and accuracy of the work of the organs, the first representative conference of the Party of the organs directly under the North China Bureau passed the trial outline for the work of the organs' branches, which clearly stipulates the tasks of the organs' branches:

    1. The primary task of the branch is: to strengthen the political and ideological education of Party members, continuously improve the class consciousness of Party members, regularly grasp the ideological situation of Party members, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and struggle against all incorrect ideas and bad tendencies, and educate each Party member to become a model of political and ideological development, diligently studying business, and abiding by the regulations of the organs.

    2. Lead and organize all staff members of the organs to carry out the study of theory, culture, current affairs, policies, and Party classes, etc., and improve the political and cultural level of all staff members of the organs.

    3. In terms of the Party's organizational work, it is necessary to check and adhere to the implementation of various systems of organizational life (such as Party day, meetings, reports, Party classes, etc.), and do a good job in collecting Party dues, educating probationary Party members, recruiting new Party members, examining and appraising Party members, and rewarding and punishing Party members.

    4. Pay attention to and reflect the emotions and requirements of the masses, and assign Party members to carry out propaganda or necessary social service work among the masses inside and outside the organs (such as the organs' service personnel, organs' young workers, family members, nannies, and residents).

    5. Strengthen security and confidentiality work.

    6. Strengthen leadership over the work of the organs' Communist Youth League. When studying, arranging, and carrying out various specific tasks, it is necessary to maintain close contact with the Communist Youth League branch of the organs and give play to the role of the Communist Youth League branch of the organs. In organs with trade unions, the branch should pay attention to the leadership of the trade union and give play to the role of the trade union.

    7. Care about the life and welfare of the staff of the organs, assist and supervise the work of the administrative staff of the organs related to life and welfare; and educate Party members to practice thrift, oppose waste, abide by the system, and promote the fine style of hard work, simplicity, mutual assistance and fraternity.

    The trial outline for branches also clarifies the division of labor among members of the general branch committee and members of the branch committee in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution and the specific conditions of the organs. In order to arrange and check various tasks, the Party Committee or the general branch should regularly convene various specialized meetings on organization, propaganda, welfare, and security.

    The trial outline also has clear provisions on how the organs' branches should carry out Party activities, that is: the branch should take unified and centralized branch activities as the main mode of activity, and should not overemphasize the role of the group. All work that needs to be carried out in a unified and universal manner should be carried out uniformly by the general branch or the branch; all major issues related to all Party members of the branch and the work plans and summaries of the branch must be discussed and decided collectively by the general branch or the branch's Party member congress. The branch's Party member congress should be held at least once a month, and sufficient preparation should be made before the meeting; the branch committee should maintain close contact with the Party members and the masses and report its work to the branch congress regularly.

    After the Party member representative conference, the directly subordinate Party Committee immediately improved the work of the branches in accordance with the resolutions of the conference, ordered each branch to further check and summarize the work of the past year, and will generally complete the re-election of the branch committee by the end of this month. Through this re-election, the Party organization of the organs will be rectified and the organizational life will be improved. The directly subordinate Party Committee believes that a strong Party Committee office must be established for such a large Party organization as the organs directly under the North China Bureau to carry out daily work under the leadership of the directly subordinate Party Committee, and cadres are now being transferred to strengthen the Party Committee office.

### 中共中央华北局直属机关的支部工作

    中共中央华北局直属机关的支部工作
    在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，中共中央华北局直属机关党委会总结了各机关的党的工作，并制定了机关支部工作试行纲要。
    一年来，华北局直属机关党委抓住了不断提高党员的马克思列宁主义水平这个重要环节，认真领导了干部的理论学习和文化学习。经验证明，这是增强机关党的战斗力，做好机关工作的最有效的办法。本届党委在过去一年内除了领导全体干部完成了中国通史的学习外，还请华北局负责同志适时地做了时事政策报告，“七一”纪念日前后，组织了党史学习，较有计划地组织了关于电影“武训传”的讨论。此外还坚持了党课、党日等制度，组织了近七百个新党员和非党干部进行了党章学习；组织了六百多人参加了业余文化学习，在一年内，完成了一学期到一学期半的课程教学。党委在抗美援朝时事政策教育方面，也取得了较好的成绩，除组织捐献慰问外，还订立了爱国公约，提高了工作效率。机关青年团的工作、保卫工作，均较过去有很大进步。机关青年团在机关党委的直接帮助下，已建立了十二个支部和团总支筹备委员会。所有这些成绩，主要是华北局的直接领导和全体党员努力的结果。
    但是，一年来的机关支部工作还存在着一些问题和缺点，这主要表现在机关支部的政治思想领导较差；党内外民主生活还不足；支部对于党员中所存在的小资产阶级思想和自由主义错误，还没有很好地组织严格的批评和自我批评。根据在“三反”运动中所暴露出来的材料，某些党员被资产阶级所腐蚀，某些党员在工作中不断犯错误，多次贪污和占公家的便宜，某些同志计较地位待遇，不安心做机关工作，这也充分反映了平日党的组织生活不够严格，以至资产阶级思想侵入党内，党内的小资产阶级作风也得以存在和抬头。机关支部的另一方面的缺点是，各机关支部和直属党委会领导方面有官僚主义毛病，有些定期的报告、会议等制度不能坚持执行，在处理处分党员和对党员转党问题上有拖延积压现象。在领导机关中的某些重要运动时，检查不够及时，没有能够通过运动把党的经常工作更加充实起来，在运动中所创造和建立的优良制度也没有能够认真贯彻下去，如爱国公约，就因为这样的原因，后来流于形式。此外，对机关党员、干部的生活困难关心不够，没有切实提出建议并监督行政方面来彻底解决这方面的问题。此外，还没有认真在党员中倡导坚持坚苦朴素的作风和互助友爱的精神。这些缺点都必须在今后工作中加以改进。
    产生这些缺点的原因主要是：第一，机关党委对机关党的工作，有一些模糊的和不正确的观念。这主要表现在有些党委委员对机关党委的工作负责不够，有的还把党委工作看作“额外负担”。过去党委领导方面强调了机关支部党员数量多、质量高、自觉性强而放松了领导。对于机关支部的任务也布置得不够全面，只强调了学习，而没有把在工作中经常地了解党员的思想情况，提高党员的觉悟，关心党员的生活，当作支部生活上的一个重要任务。第二，机关党委没有把经常工作建立起来，对于自己所属的十几个支部检查不够，不大了解机关干部的思想情况，更没有随时运用一些好、坏党员的典型事例来教育全党。由于领导方面没有能够对错误的和正确的思想、行为进行经常的原则分明的批评和表扬，因而批评和自我批评在支部生活中还没有成为经常制度，这就减弱了党的战斗力。第三，机关党委会的组织不够健全，没有各部门的行政负责同志参加，党委会的办公室的工作也不够有力。
    为了克服上述缺点，进一步提高机关工作的效率和准确性，华北局直属机关党的第一次代表大会通过了机关支部工作试行纲要，明确规定了机关支部的任务：
    一、支部的首要任务是：加强党员的政治思想教育，不断提高党员的阶级觉悟，经常掌握党员思想情况，开展批评和自我批评，和一切不正确的思想及不良倾向作斗争，教育每个党员成为政治思想开展，悉心钻研业务，遵守机关制度的模范。
    二、领导和组织机关全体工作人员进行理论、文化、时事、政策和党课等等的学习，提高机关一切工作人员的政治、文化水平。
    三、在党的组织工作方面，应检查并坚持贯彻执行组织生活的各项制度（如党日、会议、汇报、党课等制度），作好征收党费，教育候补党员，吸收新党员，审查和鉴定党员，奖励和处分党员等项工作。
    四、注意并反映群众的情绪和要求，分配党员在机关内外的群众（如机关公勤人员、机关青年工人、家属、保姆、居民等）中进行宣传或必要的社会服务工作。
    五、加强保卫工作和保密工作。
    六、对机关青年团的工作，要加强领导。在研究、布置和进行各项具体工作时，必须和青年团支部取得密切联系，发挥机关青年团支部的作用。有工会的机关，支部应注意对工会的领导，发挥工会的作用。
    七、关心机关工作人员的生活福利，协助并监督机关行政工作人员有关生活福利的各项工作；并教育党员厉行节约，反对浪费，遵守制度，发扬坚苦朴素、互助友爱的优良作风。
    支部试行纲要中还依据党章的规定和机关的具体情况确定了机关总支委员、支部委员的分工。党委会或总支为布置和检查各项工作，应定期召开组织、宣传、福利、保卫等各种专门性的会议。
    机关支部如何进行党的活动，在试行纲要中也有了明确的规定，这就是：支部应以统一集中的支部活动为主要的活动方式，不应过分强调小组的作用。凡是需要统一普遍进行的工作，均应由总支或支部统一进行；凡关系支部全体党员的重大问题及支部工作计划、总结等，必须经过总支或支部党员大会集中讨论决定。支部党员大会每月至少召开一次，会前应有充分准备；支部委员会应密切联系党员群众并定期向支部大会报告工作。
    党员代表大会开过以后，直属机关党委即根据大会的决议，改进支部工作，责成各支部进一步地检查和总结一年来的工作，并将于本月底普遍完成支部委员会的改选工作，通过此次改选，整顿机关党的组织，健全组织生活。直属党委认为，像华北局直属机关这样较为庞大的党的组织，必须有一个强有力的党委办公室，在直属党委的领导下进行日常工作，现正抽调干部充实党委办公室。
