Report and Recommendations on U.S. Germ Warfare Crimes
    ——Speech to the Council Meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers on April 16
    China's Supreme People's Court President, Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
    Shěn Jūnrú Chairman, Dear Friends:
    Today I want to bring to the attention of this Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers the issue of the U.S. government's germ warfare in Korea and China. This extremely serious issue has been placed on the agenda of the struggle of peace fighters and all people who love peace and uphold humanitarian justice worldwide. The investigation team organized by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, led by Professor Brandweiner, has conducted investigations in Korea and Northeast China into this crime by the U.S. government and has written two reports. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my warm support for the decision of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to send an investigation team and for the two reports of the investigation team, and express my gratitude for the hard work of the investigation team.
    When the U.S. government suffered a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea and had no way out, it disregarded world opinion and launched a large-scale germ warfare in Korea. Following that, it expanded the germ warfare to China and continuously violated our Northeast China airspace. Although this illegal action was immediately met with righteous warnings from people all over the world, the U.S. government has not only failed to stop it but has continued to expand it.
    The U.S. government's large-scale use of germ weapons is by no means an accidental event, but indeed the initial realization of a long-planned arrogant conspiracy and the beginning of a serious threat to world civilization and human security. This can be understood by simply looking back at its past history of preparing for germ warfare. As early as 1925, when countries signed the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of germ weapons, the U.S. government refused to ratify it. During the Second World War, the U.S. government established institutions for researching germ weapons. Following that, it continued to establish many large laboratories, field test stations, and large-scale factories for manufacturing germ weapons. It spends huge sums of money every year to increase and expand its research and manufacturing institutions for germ weapons. After the end of World War II, the U.S. government not only refused to hand over Japanese germ warfare criminals to the International Military Tribunal for trial, but instead cooperated with them. They recruited Shirō Ishii, Jirō Wakamatsu, Masazō Kitano, and other Japanese germ warfare criminals who had conducted germ warfare in China to help them in their preparations for germ warfare. The U.S. government's long-term and large-scale preparation of germ weapons clearly shows its premeditated plan and determination to use large-scale destructive germ weapons to wage war.
    The public statements of important figures in the U.S. military and political circles have long exposed the crimes of the U.S. government. According to the U.S. magazine "Collier's" in June 1946, Waitt, head of the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service, said: "I completely disagree with talking about whether a weapon is humane."
    The fact that the U.S. government has used germ weapons on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China has been confirmed by the two investigation reports of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team. This crime seriously violates the most basic principles of human morality. The U.S. government is well aware of the seriousness of this criminal act and is doing its best to deny and quibble. However, the conclusive evidence in the hands of the Chinese and Korean people unequivocally demonstrates that the U.S. government's denial and sophistry are shameful acts. The facts prove that the U.S. government actively prepared germ weapons for the large-scale slaughter of human beings, first tested them in Korea and China, and will continue to use them in other parts of the world, attempting to sacrifice countless lives to achieve its goal of dominating the world. If this barbaric act is not punished, human security cannot be guaranteed.
    Chairman and dear friends, in a gathering of legal professionals, we must also emphasize that the U.S. government's use of germ weapons is a serious violation of international law. The 1925 Geneva Protocol explicitly prohibits the use of germ weapons. This was established by the majority of countries in the world and has long constituted a part of international law. The U.S. government should not be allowed to deny the binding force of this convention on the grounds that it signed but did not ratify it. Moreover, the principle of this prohibition has long been included in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Both conventions stipulate a ban on the use of poisons or poisoned weapons. Even the U.S.
    "Rules of Land Warfare" (1940) also stipulates that the Hague Convention's prohibition "applies to the use of means of spreading infectious diseases." Traditional international law also includes the prohibition of the use of germ weapons within two basic principles regarding means of warfare; these two principles are: means of warfare should avoid causing unnecessary suffering to combatants and should not harm peaceful people. Therefore, the U.S. government's conduct of germ warfare is undoubtedly a serious violation of international law. This crime is a war crime stipulated in traditional international law and a crime against humanity defined in the 1945 London "Charter of the International Military Tribunal" and should be severely punished. As early as 1950, the World Peace Congress, in its letter to the United Nations, declared an unconditional ban on germ weapons and declared the government that first uses such weapons to be a war criminal. The World Peace Council again passed a resolution with the same content in 1951. On April 2 of this year, the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council passed a "Call to the Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare," more explicitly calling for strong action to bring those criminals who use the most despicable, filthy, and appalling weapons to justice as war criminals. This sacred provision representing the will of all mankind has been severely violated by the U.S. aggressors. The U.S. aggressors have become enemies of all mankind and should be severely sanctioned by all mankind.
    Justice is on our side, and strength is also on our side. We, the Chinese people, unanimously support the solemn statements issued by our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on February 24 and March 8, and are determined to fight to the end with the peace-loving people of the world to stop the U.S. germ warfare crimes. The large-scale germ eradication and epidemic prevention campaign of the Chinese and Korean people has been actively launched in the relevant areas. We have the firm determination and confidence that we must and will defeat the germ warfare launched by the U.S. government. Peace fighters and peace-loving people from all countries are uniting to fight, and the roar of anger resounds throughout the world. Soviet representative Malik's severe condemnation of the U.S. germ warfare crimes in the United Nations Disarmament Commission and his proposal for prompt and severe punishment have aroused enthusiastic support from the world's peace-loving people. As long as the peace-loving people of the world continue their efforts and resolutely fight to the end, they will surely be able to stop this serious criminal behavior of the United States.
    Chairman and dear friends, world democratic legal workers are an important force in this struggle. The call of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, its serious protest to the United Nations against the U.S. germ warfare, and the results of the investigation conducted by the investigation team in Korea and China have already had a huge impact worldwide, especially among legal workers. I am convinced that the work of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers will continue to play an even greater role. We must quickly take various measures to expand this worldwide anti-germ warfare struggle, uphold the dignity of international law, and safeguard human justice and security. To this end, on behalf of all Chinese legal workers, I would like to submit the following recommendations to the conference for discussion and decision:
    1. It is recommended that the Council fully support the investigation report of the investigation team, expose the U.S. government's serious violation of international law and crimes of slaughtering human beings, publicize the truth of the crimes to the people of the world, and declare the initiators, organizers, and executors of germ warfare, including air force personnel who use germ weapons, as war criminals.
    2. Support Soviet representative Malik's proposal in the United Nations Disarmament Commission to immediately pass a resolution prohibiting the use of germ weapons and punishing those who use germ weapons.
    3. It is recommended that the Council pass a resolution calling on the national branches of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and legal workers around the world to take action, actively support the "Call to the Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" issued by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, unanimously condemn the U.S. government's crimes of using germ weapons with righteous voices, and unite the people of the world to work together to establish solemn international laws and regulations that unconditionally prohibit the use of germ weapons and declare the government that first uses germ weapons as a war criminal, and struggle for their strict compliance.

    关于美国细菌战罪行的报告和建议
    ——四月十六日在国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议上的讲话
    中国最高人民法院院长、国际民主法律工作者协会副主席
    沈钧儒主席、亲爱的朋友们：
    今天我要向国际民主法律工作者协会本届理事会提出美国政府在朝鲜和中国发动细菌战的问题。这个极端严重的问题，已经提到全世界和平战士及一切爱好和平、维护人道正义的人民的斗争日程上了。国际民主法律工作者协会所组成的以布兰德魏纳教授为首的调查团在朝鲜和中国东北对美国政府这种罪行进行了调查之后，已经写出了两个报告书。我首先代表中国人民，对国际民主法律工作者协会派遣调查团的决定及调查团的两个报告书，表示热烈的拥护，并对调查团的辛劳，表示感谢。
    美国政府在侵朝战争遭受惨败、无路可走的时候，竟不惜冒天下之大不韪，在朝鲜发动了大规模的细菌战，跟着，又把细菌战扩大到了中国，连续侵犯我国东北领空。这种非法行动，虽然迅即受到全世界人民的正义警告，但是，直到现在，美国政府不但未将其停止，而且还在继续加以扩大。
    美国政府大规模使用细菌武器，决不是一个偶然事件，而确是一个蓄意已久的狂妄阴谋的初步实现，是一个对世界文明和人类安全的严重威胁的开始。这只要稍一回顾其过去准备细菌战的历史，即可了然。早在一九二五年各国签订禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书时，美国政府即拒绝加以批准。在第二次大战期中，美国政府已设立了研究细菌武器的机构，跟着，它继续建立了许多大实验室、野外试验站以及大规模制造细菌武器的工厂。它每年花费巨额款项，以增加和扩大其研究和制造细菌武器的机构。美国政府在第二次大战结束以后，不但拒绝把日本细菌战犯交付国际军事法庭审判，反而与他们合作。他们收用了石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等曾在中国进行细菌战的日本细菌战犯，以帮助其进行关于细菌战的准备工作。美国政府这样长期大规模的准备细菌武器，再明显没有地表示了其蓄意使用大规模毁灭性的细菌武器来进行战争的计划与决心。
    美国军界、政界重要人物的公开言论，早已暴露了美国政府的罪行。根据一九四六年六月美国“柯里尔”杂志，美国陆军化学战争处处长韦特说：“我完全不同意谈一种武器是否合乎人道的问题。”
    美国政府在朝鲜和中国东北大规模使用细菌武器的事实，已由国际民主法律工作者调查团的两个调查报告所证实了。这种罪行，严重地违反了人类道德最基本的原则。美国政府深知这种罪恶行为的严重性，正在极力进行抵赖和狡辩。可是，掌握在中朝人民手上的确凿证据肯定说明了美国政府的抵赖和诡辩是可耻的举动。事实证明，美国政府积极准备了大规模屠杀人类的细菌武器，在朝鲜和中国首先试用，将来并将继续使用到世界其他各处，并企图牺牲无可计数的生命，来实现它的称霸世界的目的。这种野蛮行动如果不受到惩罚，人类的安全便得不到保障。
    主席和亲爱的朋友们，在一个法律工作者的集会里，我们还必须强调指出，美国政府使用细菌武器，是严重地违反了国际公法。一九二五年的日内瓦议定书曾以明文禁止使用细菌武器。这是世界大多数国家所订立的，早已构成国际公法的一部分，决不容美国政府以虽签字而并未批准为藉口来否认这一公约的约束力。何况此种禁令的原则早已包括在一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约之内。该两公约均规定禁止使用毒物或有毒武器。就是美国的
    “陆战规则”（一九四○年）也规定了海牙公约的这一禁令“适用于散布传染病的手段的使用”。传统的国际公法也是把禁止使用细菌武器包括在两个有关战争手段的基本原则之内的；这两个原则就是：战争手段应避免使战斗员受不必要的痛苦，并应不使和平的人民受害。所以美国政府之进行细菌战是严重违反国际公法的行为，实属毫无疑义。这种罪行是传统的国际公法上所规定的战争的犯罪，也是一九四五年伦敦的“国际军事法庭规章”所定的违反人道的犯罪，应受严厉惩罚。世界和平大会早在一九五○年通过的致联合国书中，就已声明无条件禁止细菌武器，宣布首先使用这种武器的政府为战争罪犯。世界和平理事会又在一九五一年通过同样内容的决议，本年四月二日世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议又通过“反对细菌战”的告世界男女书，更明确地提出要求采取强有力的行动，把那些使用最卑鄙龌龊、最骇人听闻的武器的罪犯们，作为战犯归案法办。这种表现全人类意志的神圣规定，已被美国侵略者严重破坏。美国侵略者实已成为全人类的敌人，应受全人类的严厉制裁。
    正义是在我们方面，力量也是在我们方面的。我们中国人民一致拥护我中央人民政府周恩来外长二月二十四日与三月八日所发表的严正声明，坚决与世界爱好和平的人民为制止美国细菌战罪行而共同斗争到底。中朝人民的大规模扑灭细菌的防疫运动，已在有关地区积极展开。我们有坚强的决心和信心，一定要，并且一定会战胜美国政府所发动的细菌战。各国和平战士和爱好和平的人民都在一致起来斗争，愤怒的吼声响彻了全世界。苏联代表马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会对于美国细菌战罪行的严厉谴责以及他所提出的迅予严办的主张，已经引起了世界爱和平人民热烈的拥护。全世界爱好和平的人民，只要再接再厉地坚决斗争到底，便一定能够制止美国这种严重的犯罪行为。
    主席和亲爱的朋友们，世界民主法律工作者在这个斗争中，是一个重要的力量。国际民主法律工作者协会的号召及其向联合国所提的对美国细菌战的严重抗议以及所派调查团在朝鲜和中国调查的结果，已经在世界范围内，尤其是在法律工作者之间，发生了巨大的影响。我深信国际民主法律工作者协会的工作将继续发生更加重大的作用。我们必须迅速采取各种措施，以扩大这一世界性的反细菌战的斗争，维护国际法规的尊严与人类的正义和安全。为此，我谨代表全中国的法律工作者，向大会提出下列建议，请大会讨论决定：
    一、建议理事会全力支持调查团的调查报告，揭露美国政府严重违反国际公法和屠杀人类的罪行，把罪行真相公诸全世界人民的面前，宣布细菌战的发动者、组织者、执行者，包括使用细菌武器的空军人员，为战争罪犯。
    二、拥护苏联代表马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会的主张，马上通过决议，禁止使用细菌武器，并惩办细菌武器使用者。
    三、建议理事会通过决议，号召国际民主法律工作者协会各国分会及全世界法律工作者采取行动，积极支持世界和平理事会执行局为“反对细菌战”而发表的告全世界男女书，对美国政府使用细菌武器的罪行，一致作正义的声讨，并团结全世界人民共同努力，为确立无条件禁止使用细菌武器、宣布首先使用细菌武器的政府为战犯的庄严国际法规及其严格遵行而斗争。
