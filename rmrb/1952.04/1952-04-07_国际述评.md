　　Stalin's Answers to Questions from American Newspaper Editors Strengthen the World's People's Victorious Confidence in Defending Peace

　　Soviet Minister Chairman Stalin's answers on March 31st to the four questions about the current international situation posed by fifty local newspaper editors in America are of great significance. American newspaper editors asked: "Is a third world war more imminent now than it was two or three years ago?" Stalin answered decisively: "No, it is not." They also asked: "On what basis is the coexistence of capitalism and communism possible?" Stalin answered: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill obligations undertaken, and if the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism is entirely possible." Stalin's words are a powerful encouragement to the great struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose the imperialist war plot; and they enable those who have been confused by the mad actions of American war-mongers to clearly see the victorious future of the struggle to defend world peace unfolding before their eyes. Stalin's words are undoubtedly a crushing blow to the imperialist war-mongers' conspiracy to provoke a new war.
　　A year ago, Stalin pointed out in an interview with a reporter from Pravda: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the war-mongers succeed in entrapping the masses with a web of lies, deceiving the masses, and dragging the masses into another world war, then war may become inevitable." Over the past year, the people of all countries have followed the path pointed out by Stalin and waged a solemn struggle to defend the cause of world peace, and have achieved great victories. More than six hundred million people in various countries have signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, a figure that is more than 120 million more than the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal; the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers inflicted heavy blows on the American aggressors' military adventure on the Korean battlefield, and forced them to accept armistice negotiations; the colonial people's movement for national independence is unfolding vigorously and extensively; the American imperialists' criminal activities of rearming Japan and West Germany have aroused strong resistance from the Japanese and German people; and the people of the United States and its satellite countries are waging a resolute struggle against the U.S. imperialists' policy of recklessly expanding armaments and preparing for war. These victories all demonstrate that the momentum of the world's peace movement is growing stronger and stronger, and reflects the most profound desire for peace of the people of all countries. Although the war-mongers are trying everything possible to drag the people of all countries into another world war, with the ever-increasing strength of the world's peace forces, the war-mongers' conspiracy to provoke a new war will inevitably continue to suffer setbacks.

　　People of All Countries Continue to Oppose Germ Warfare and Demand the Conclusion of a Peace Pact

　　Faced with the current international situation, the hundreds of millions of people of all countries united around the World Peace Council are stepping up their campaign to defend peace.
　　The movement to protest the crimes of the American aggressors in waging germ warfare against Korea and China has formed a mass movement in various countries. As the "International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team," the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Germ Warfare by American Imperialism," and democratic journalists from various countries in Korea continue to provide a large amount of conclusive evidence of the American crimes of germ warfare, the protest movement in various countries is becoming increasingly surging.
　　The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Oslo, the capital of Norway, from March 29 to April 1. Guo Moruo, the head of our country's delegation, spoke at the meeting, denouncing the towering crimes of the United States in waging germ warfare, which won the unanimous support of representatives from various countries. In accordance with the urgent wishes of the people of all countries, the meeting passed a "Letter to the Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare," calling on the people of all countries to wage a resolute struggle against germ warfare. The general resolution of the meeting further called on the people of all countries to step up the movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact in order to crush the imperialist plan to expand armaments and prepare for war.
　　In Moscow, the International Economic Conference, initiated by the World Peace Council in accordance with the wishes of the people of all countries, opened on April 3. No matter how the U.S. government attempts to obstruct and sabotage this conference, representatives from business circles in many capitalist countries have come to Moscow. The convening of this conference powerfully proves that developing international economic relations under peaceful conditions to improve the living conditions of the people of all countries and thereby strengthen the movement to defend world peace is the irresistible common demand of the people of all countries. Anyone who attempts to prevent the realization of this demand is bound to suffer a shameful defeat.
　　The persistent activities of the peace forces of all countries have prompted the United Nations to begin discussing the issue of universal disarmament. The United Nations Disarmament Commission is currently meeting in New York. At the meetings on March 26 and 28, the Soviet representative spoke, continuing to refute the U.S. plan for the Disarmament Commission, which disregards the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as disarmament and reduction of armed forces, and explained that the plan proposed by the Soviet Union is in line with the wishes of the people of the world to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and to reduce armaments and armed forces. Malik also repeatedly requested the Disarmament Commission to discuss the issue of violating the ban on germ warfare, and to study how to condemn and punish violators of this ban, based on the fact that the United States is waging germ warfare in Korea and China and the protests of the people of all countries against this heinous crime; Malik suggested that a resolution be adopted immediately to stop this shameful war crime. However, the U.S. representative arrogantly and shamelessly refused to discuss and study the issue of germ warfare crimes. This fact fully exposes the ugly face of the American murderers and the hypocrisy of the American disarmament plan.
　　However, as pointed out in the general resolution of the Oslo meeting of the World Peace Council, the continuous growth of the peace forces of all countries will surely make it possible to prohibit weapons of mass destruction and to implement gradual, simultaneous, and strictly supervised disarmament. As long as the people of all countries take resolute action, they can change the direction of the development of things and conclude a peace pact that ensures the peaceful coexistence of different political and social systems.

　　Imperialist Aggression in Asia and North Africa Continues to Suffer Defeats

　　On one side, the world's peace forces are constantly growing, and on the other, the imperialist forces of aggression are constantly weakening.
　　From Korea to Tunisia, the imperialist line of military aggression is suffering heavy blows from the forces of the people of all countries.
　　In Korea, the American aggressors' evil plan to expand the war with the vicious attack of germ weapons has failed and continues to be shattered due to the victorious crushing of the germ weapon attack by the Chinese and Korean people and people's forces. The airborne agents they sent to collect intelligence on the effects of germ warfare have either been captured or surrendered. This has made the brutal and bloodthirsty American murderers feel extremely embarrassed and panicked. In this situation, the American negotiators at the armistice negotiations conference are still shamelessly continuing to employ delaying tactics. They illegally broke the agreement of the four-agenda administrative meeting and were reprimanded by our representatives; at the staff meeting on the three agendas, they absurdly and unreasonably attempted to replace "Korea" with the decaying word "South Korea" in the Chinese and Korean drafts of the armistice agreement, which can only expose that their delaying tactics are becoming more and more inferior.
　　The embarrassment and predicament of the American aggressors and their negotiators in Korea is admitted even by the reactionary American newspaper "The Christian Science Monitor." The Washington correspondence of this newspaper on March 13 said: "Panmunjom still offers little room for maneuvers and bargaining. Therefore, Washington decision-makers conclude that, on balance, using new military pressure as a means of trying to force a solution to the Korean problem would not be worth the loss." The facts prove that the American aggressors' military pressure on the Korean battlefield has gone bankrupt, and the trick of delaying negotiations has become increasingly exhausted. All the evil conspiracies of the American aggressors are bound to suffer more serious blows from the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.
　　In other parts of Asia and North Africa, the struggle of the people of all countries for independence and liberation continues to rise, posing a serious threat to the imperialist aggression system. The victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in liberating Hoa Binh City continues to expand its influence; the consumption and blows suffered by French and American imperialism in the Vietnam War have also made the American "Christian Science Monitor" admit that it is "the source of the only largest weakness in the North Atlantic Alliance." The Malayan National Liberation Army launched more than 200 attacks on the British aggressors in February. The French colonialists' brutal suppression of the Tunisian national liberation movement in its North African colony has aroused the anger of the Tunisian people, the North African people, and the peace-loving people of the world; the Tunisian people are carrying out struggles of marches, demonstrations, strikes, class boycotts, and market boycotts to resist the suppression of the French colonialists.
　　The struggles of the Asian and North African people have made U.S. Senator Smith exclaim that this "unstable region" of the Near East and the Far East poses a more direct threat to them than Europe. Even the most reactionary American journalist, Lippmann, had to admit that the United States felt "stretched thin" because it "lacked the necessary strategic reserves, especially infantry... and the air force also lacked reserves," which made the U.S. policy of so-called "encirclement" and aggression against Asia feel "stretched thin."
　　The failure of the U.S. imperialists' world aggression policy has caused new and fierce quarrels within them. Since U.S. President Truman submitted to the U.S. Congress in early March a message and a report on the implementation of the so-called "Common Security Program," requesting approval of the $7.9 billion in "foreign aid appropriations" stipulated in the program for this year, the quarrels within the U.S. ruling group over the current aggression policy have become increasingly apparent. Since March 13, the military and political leaders of the U.S. government have been attending the U.S. Congress's Senate and House of Representatives for days to testify for the "Common Security Program." Although Acheson described this plan as "almost the lifeblood of the North Atlantic Organization," they could not provide any facts to show that the current U.S. policy, which has been met with setbacks everywhere, has any future. Therefore, this plan still aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the members of Congress. The British Conservative Party government's recently announced budget for 1952-1953, which frantically expands armaments and attacks the people's living standards, has been fiercely opposed by the vast number of British people. Even British ruling figures, such as Gaitskell, are deeply worried, saying that this budget "is bound to fuel inflation. Its final impact will seriously endanger production. This budget will make us (Britain) split and weaken." In France, the new budget of the Binh Nait Cabinet, which has just taken office, will account for 40% of military expenditures. In order to cope with such huge military expenditures, Binh Nait is preparing to increase taxes and cut civil administration and social insurance expenses.
　　Whether it is the United States, or Britain and France, the policy of expanding armaments cannot find any future for imperialism. If it has any future, it is destined to continue to fail.

专栏：国际述评

　　国际述评
    斯大林对美国报纸编辑所提问题的答复，加强着全世界人民保卫和平的胜利信心
    苏联部长会议主席斯大林于三月三十一日答复了美国的五十位地方报纸编辑所提出的关于目前国际形势的四个问题，这是有重大意义的。美国报纸编辑们问：“第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？”斯大林斩钉截铁地回答说：“不，不是这样。”他们又问：“在什么基础上资本主义与共产主义的共存才是可能的？”斯大林回答说：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”斯大林的话对于全世界人民为保卫和平、反对帝国主义战争阴谋所进行的伟大斗争，是一个有力的鼓舞；并且使那些被美国战争贩子的疯狂行动造成的紧张局势所迷惑的人们，清醒地看到了展开在他们眼前的保卫世界和平斗争的胜利前程；斯大林的话对于帝国主义战争贩子们挑拨新战争的阴谋，无疑地是一个粉碎性的打击。
    一年以前，斯大林在对真理报记者的谈话中曾经指出：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。”一年来，各国人民遵循着斯大林所指出的道路，为保卫世界和平事业进行了庄严的斗争，而且已获得了伟大的胜利。各国人民在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名的已超过六亿，这个数字比在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数还多一亿二千多万；英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战场上给予美国侵略者的军事冒险以沉重的打击，并迫使他们不得不接受停战谈判；殖民地人民争取民族独立运动正如火如荼地广泛展开；美帝国主义重新武装日本和西德的罪恶活动，激起了日本和德国人民的强烈反抗；美国及其仆从国家的人民，正为反对美帝国主义一意孤行的扩军备战政策进行着坚决的斗争。这些胜利都说明了全世界保卫和平运动的声势日益浩大，并且反映了各国人民最深切的和平愿望。虽然战争贩子们想尽一切方法要把各国人民卷入另一次世界大战中去，然而在世界和平力量不断增长的情况下，战争贩子们挑拨新战争的阴谋就必然不断地遭受到挫败。
    各国人民继续反对细菌战并要求缔结和平公约
    面对着目前的国际形势，团结在世界和平理事会周围的各国亿万人民，正在加紧开展保卫和平的运动。
    抗议美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国进行细菌战罪行的运动，已在各国形成一种群众性运动。由于“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”、“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”和在朝鲜的各国民主记者继续大量地提供了美国进行细菌战罪行的确凿证据，各国人民的抗议运动正日益澎湃起来。
    世界和平理事会于三月二十九日到四月一日在挪威首都奥斯陆举行了执行局会议，我国代表团团长郭沫若在会上发言，声讨美国进行细菌战的滔天罪行，获得了各国代表的一致支持。根据各国人民的迫切愿望，会议通过了“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书，号召各国人民为反对细菌战进行坚决的斗争。会议的总决议中，更进一步号召各国人民必须加紧进行要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动，以粉碎帝国主义扩军备战的计划。
    在莫斯科，由世界和平理事会根据各国人民的愿望而倡议召开的国际经济会议，已于四月三日开幕。不管美国政府如何企图对这个会议进行阻挠和破坏，许多资本主义国家的工商界代表还是到了莫斯科。这个会议的召开，有力地证明了在和平条件下发展国际经济关系，以改善各国人民的生活状况并从而加强保卫世界和平运动，是各国人民的不可抗拒的共同要求，如果有人妄想阻止这种要求的实现，他就一定要遭到可耻的失败。
    各国和平力量的坚持活动，已促使联合国开始讨论普遍裁减军备问题。目前联合国裁减军备委员会正在纽约举行。在三月二十六日、二十八日的会议上，苏联代表发言，继续驳斥美国所提出的裁减军备委员会的工作计划是一个漠视禁止原子武器和其他大规模杀人武器以及裁减军备和武装部队的必要性的计划，并说明苏联所提出的计划，是符合全世界人民要求禁止原子武器和其他大规模杀人的武器以及裁减军备和武装部队的愿望的。马立克并且根据美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的事实和各国人民对这种万恶罪行的抗议，一再要求裁减军备委员会讨论关于违反细菌战禁令的问题，研究如何谴责和惩办这个禁令的违反者；马立克建议立即通过决议，制止这种可耻的战争罪行。而美国代表却蛮横无耻地拒绝讨论和研究关于细菌战罪行的问题。这个事实就完全暴露了美国杀人犯的丑恶嘴脸和美国的裁减军备工作计划的虚伪性。
    然而，正如世界和平理事会奥斯陆会议的总决议中所指出的，各国和平力量的不断增长，一定会使具有大规模毁灭性的武器得以禁止，并使逐步、同时和有严格监督的裁减军备得以实行。各国人民只要坚决行动起来，就能够改变事物发展的方向，能够缔结一个确保不同的政治与社会制度和平共存的和平公约。
    帝国主义在亚洲和北非的侵略继续遭受失败
    一面是世界和平力量不断地增长，一面是帝国主义侵略力量的不断削弱。
    从朝鲜直到突尼斯，帝国主义的军事侵略线正遭受各国人民力量的沉重打击。
    在朝鲜，美国侵略者以细菌武器的狠毒进攻扩大战争的罪恶计划，由于中朝人民和人民部队胜利地粉碎了并且继续粉碎着细菌武器的进攻，而无法得逞。他们为收集细菌战效果的情报而派遣的空降特务，或者纷纷落网或者自首了。这就使得残暴嗜血的美国杀人犯们不能不感到异常狼狈和恐慌。在这种情形下，美国的谈判代表在停战谈判会议上仍在无耻地继续施展拖延手段。他们非法破坏了四项议程行政会议的协议，而遭到了我方代表的斥责；他们在三项议程的参谋会议上，又荒谬无理地妄图在中文和朝文的停战协议草案上以“韩国”这一腐朽不堪的字样来代替“朝鲜”，这只能暴露出他们的拖延手法是越来越低劣了。
    美国侵略者及其谈判代表在朝鲜的处境的狼狈和困窘，甚至连美国的反动报纸“基督教科学箴言报”也不得不加以承认。这个报纸的三月十三日的华盛顿通讯说：“板门店依然很少施展计谋和讨价还价的余地。所以，华盛顿的决策者们得出结论，认为权衡起来，若使用新的军事压力来作为试图强迫解决朝鲜问题的办法，那就所得不偿所失”。事实证明美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上的军事压力已经破产了，拖延谈判的伎俩也已日益穷竭了，美国侵略者的一切罪恶阴谋必然要遭受到中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的更为严重的打击的。
    在亚洲其他地区和非洲北部，各国人民争取独立解放的斗争正在继续高涨，使帝国主义的侵略体系感受到严重的威胁。越南人民军解放和平城的胜利影响还在继续扩大；越南战争使法、美帝国主义所受到的消耗和打击，也使美国的“基督教科学箴言报”不能不承认是“北大西洋联盟中唯一最大的荏弱因素的来源”。马来亚的民族解放军，在二月份就对英国侵略军进行了二百次以上的袭击。法国殖民者对它的北非殖民地突尼斯民族解放运动的野蛮镇压，已引起了突尼斯人民、北非人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒；突尼斯人民正在进行游行示威、罢工、罢课和罢市的斗争，来反抗法国殖民者的镇压。
    亚洲人民和北非人民的斗争，已使得美国参议员史密斯惊呼近东和远东这个“不安定的地区”对他们的威胁比欧洲更为直接。就连美国最反动的记者李普曼也不得不承认美国因为“没有必要的战略后备力量，尤其是步兵……空军也缺少后备力量”，而使对亚洲实行所谓“包围”侵略政策的美国感到“捉襟见肘”。
    美帝国主义世界侵略政策的失败，已引起了他们内部新的激烈争吵。美国总统杜鲁门于三月上旬向美国国会提出的关于所谓“共同安全计划”的咨文和执行情况的报告，要求批准本年度该项计划所规定的七十九亿美元的“援外拨款”以后，美国统治集团内部关于现行侵略政策的争吵已日趋表面化。自从三月十三日起，美国政府的军政首脑们都连日出席美国国会参众两院为“共同安全计划”作证。尽管艾奇逊把这个计划说成为“几乎就是北大西洋组织的命根子”，但是他们却提不出任何事实，足以说明到处碰壁的现行的美国政策有什么前途。因此，这个计划依然引起议员们的普遍不满。英国保守党政府在不久以前宣布的、疯狂地扩张军备并向人民生活水准进攻的一九五二—一九五三年度的预算，遭受到英国广大人民的激烈反对，就连英国统治集团人物，如贾兹克尔也十分忧虑地说，这个预算“势必会助长通货膨胀。它的最后影响将严重地危及生产。这个预算将使我们（英国）分裂、变弱。”在法国，刚刚上台不久的比内内阁的新预算，军费将占百分之四十。为了要应付这样庞大的军费支出，比内正准备增税和削减民政和社会保险费用。
    不管是美国也好，或是英国和法国也好，扩张军备政策是不能替帝国主义找出什么前途的。如果说它有什么前途的话，那就是注定要继续遭到失败。
