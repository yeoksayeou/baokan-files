    Peasants Generally Have the Means to Purchase Fertilizer
    ——A Typical Investigation of the Fertilizer Purchasing Power of Peasants in Yanshi, Henan, and Xiangyang, Hubei
    Zhongnan District Cooperative Enterprise Administration
    In order to correctly understand the fertilizer needs of peasants and their ability to purchase fertilizer, so as to better carry out fertilizer supply work, Yanshi County in Henan Province and Xiangyang County in Hubei Province conducted typical investigations in several villages:

    (1) Zhaihou Village in Yanshi County has a total of 111 households, with 632 people (including 341 poor peasants, 221 middle peasants, and 70 landlords and rich peasants); there are 1,912 mu of land, of which 684 mu are planted with cotton this year (accounting for more than 35% of the total cultivated land area), 1,081 mu are planted with wheat, 120 mu are planted with sweet potatoes, and more than 20 mu are planted with other crops. In order to complete the task of producing 60 jin of cotton per mu of cotton field, a planned 41,040 jin of fertilizer is needed (equivalent to 60 jin per mu). The masses have already accumulated 1,010 carts of manure (equivalent to 15,150 jin of cake fertilizer), and the cooperative has purchased 22,715 jin of cake fertilizer. Currently, a total of 37,865 jin of fertilizer have been prepared. The fertilizer purchased by the masses with cash has reached more than 50% of the fertilizer shortage, and only a few poor peasants and hired laborers are truly unable to purchase it.

    (2) Baozhai Village in Yanshi County conducted a typical investigation of three middle peasant households and two poor peasant households in the village:

    Su Runzhang (middle peasant): The family has 18 mu of land and eight people, planting four mu of cotton and 13 mu of wheat. They have accumulated six carts of manure and purchased 200 jin of cake fertilizer, totaling 290 jin; the cake fertilizer is used for cotton fields, and the accumulated manure is used for sweet potato fields.

    Su Xiaoshui (poor peasant): The family has nine mu of land and four people, planting six mu of cotton and three mu of wheat; they purchased 360 jin of cake fertilizer from the cooperative, all of which was applied to cotton fields.

    Su Xingyi (middle peasant): The family has 32 mu of land and seven people, planting 19 mu of cotton, 11 mu of wheat, and two mu of other crops; they accumulated 10 carts of manure and purchased 690 jin of cake fertilizer from the cooperative.

    Su Lindong (middle peasant): The family has 11 mu of land and six people, planting four mu of cotton, six mu of wheat, and one mu of sweet potatoes; they accumulated 13 carts of manure and purchased 405 jin of cake fertilizer and 30 pieces of cotton cake, totaling 720 jin of cake fertilizer, of which 420 jin were used for cotton fields (equivalent to 105 jin per mu), and the remainder will be left for autumn application.

    Su Jing (poor peasant): The family has seven mu of land and five people, planting three mu of cotton, three and a half mu of wheat, and half a mu of sweet potatoes; they accumulated two carts of manure and purchased 150 jin of cake fertilizer, totaling 180 jin, all of which was applied to cotton fields.

    In Baozhai Village, except for two households, each mu of land is prepared to apply at least 20 jin of cake fertilizer, and the fertilizer already purchased by the peasants accounts for more than 60% of the fertilizer shortage.

    (3) Yuanjia Village in Xiangyang County has a total of 85 households, including 40 poor peasant households, 38 middle peasant households, and 7 landlord and rich peasant households, with a total of 332 people and 937 mu of land, of which 194 mu are planted with cotton (accounting for more than 20% of the total cultivated land area). According to a typical investigation of 12 households in Yuanjia Village, combined with general estimation, the village's cotton fields require a total of 19,400 jin of fertilizer (equivalent to 100 jin per mu); of which the masses accumulated 630 carts of manure (equivalent to 12,600 jin of sesame cake), accounting for 65% of the fertilizer requirement; there is still a shortage of about 7,000 jin of cake fertilizer. The masses are able to purchase 2,450 jin with cash, leaving a difference of 4,550 jin. The reason for being unable to purchase these more than 4,550 jin of fertilizer is that a lot of tobacco leaves accumulated in the hands of the masses cannot be sold; as long as the tobacco leaves are sold, they will have more money to buy fertilizer.

    From the above typical investigations, it can be seen that peasants generally have the means to purchase fertilizer. Therefore, in fertilizer supply work, supply and marketing cooperatives should truly grasp the peasants' fertilizer needs and fertilizer purchasing power, and actively help them solve the difficulties in purchasing fertilizer (such as finding sales outlets for local products); at the same time, they should closely cooperate with the local Party organizations and People's Government to strengthen the publicity of fertilizer cash sales and fully persuade the masses: the cooperative's current fertilizer sales are to accelerate the turnover of fertilizer funds, supply more fertilizer to the peasants, and better meet the needs of peasants in production; it should be explained that "credit sales and purchase orders" are a kind of help to peasants who are indeed having difficulties in production, and if peasants who have the ability to buy fertilizer also purchase on credit, it will inevitably affect the help to poor peasants and does not conform to the purpose of the state's fertilizer loan issuance. It is entirely possible for peasants to purchase fertilizer with cash, and it is necessary to overcome the one-sided mass viewpoint and the bureaucratic work style of not conducting specific and practical investigations that currently exist in the minds of some cadres.

    农民一般是有力量购买肥料的
    ——河南偃师和湖北襄阳农民购买肥料能力的典型调查
    中南区合作事业管理局
    为了正确地了解农民需肥情况和购买肥料的能力，以便更好地进行供应肥料工作，河南省偃师县和湖北省襄阳县对若干村进行了典型调查：
    （一）偃师县的砦后村共有一百一十一户，六百三十二人（其中贫农三百四十一人、中农二百二十一人、地主和富农七十人）；土地一千九百一十二亩，今年种棉六百八十四亩（占耕地总面积的百分之三十五强），种麦一千零八十一亩，种红薯一百二十亩，其他二十余亩。为了完成每亩棉田生产棉花六十斤的任务，计划需要肥料四万一千零四十斤（每亩合六十斤），群众现已积肥一千零一十车（折合饼肥一万五千一百五十斤），合作社购进饼肥二万二千七百一十五斤，目前共准备肥料三万七千八百六十五斤。群众已用现款购买的肥料已达所缺肥料的百分之五十以上，真正无力购买的只是几家贫农雇农。
    （二）偃师县的包砦村对本村中农三户和贫农二户，作了典型调查：
    苏润章（中农）：全家有地十八亩，八口人，种棉四亩、麦十三亩。现已积肥六车，购买了饼肥二百斤，共合二百九十斤；饼肥用于棉田，积粪用于红薯田。
    苏小水（贫农）：全家有地九亩，四口人，种棉六亩、麦三亩；在合作社购买饼肥三百六十斤，全部施于棉田。
    苏兴义（中农）：全家有地三十二亩，七口人，种棉十九亩、麦十一亩、其他二亩；积肥十车，从合作社购买饼肥六百九十斤。
    苏林东（中农）：全家有地十一亩，六口人，种棉四亩、麦六亩、红薯一亩；积肥十三车，购买饼肥四百零五斤，棉饼三十块，共折合饼肥七百二十斤，用于棉田四百二十斤（每亩合一百零五斤），下余留到秋天上地。
    苏井（贫农）：全家有地七亩，五口人，种棉三亩、麦三亩半、红薯半亩；积肥二车，买饼肥一百五十斤，共合一百八十斤，全部施于棉田。
    包砦村农民除两户外，每亩地都至少准备施饼肥二十斤，农民已购买的肥料占所缺肥料的百分之六十以上。
    （三）襄阳县袁家村共有八十五户，其中贫农四十户，中农三十八户，地主和富农七户，共三百三十二口人，九百三十七亩地，种棉一百九十四亩
    （占耕地总面积的百分之二十强）。根据对袁家村十二户的典型调查，结合一般推算，全村棉田共需肥料一万九千四百斤（每亩合一百斤）；其中群众积肥六百三十车（折合麻饼一万二千六百斤），相当于需肥量的百分之六十五；还缺约七千斤饼肥。群众能够现购二千四百五十斤，这样就还差四千五百五十斤。这四千五百余斤肥料无力购买的原因，是积存在群众手里的许多烟叶卖不出；只要卖出了烟叶，他们就增加了买肥料的钱。
    从以上的几个典型调查来看，农民一般是有力量购买肥料的。因此，供销合作社在肥料供应工作中，应切实掌握农民需肥量和购买肥料能力的情况，积极地帮助他们解决购买肥料的困难（如为土产找销路等）；同时，应和当地党的组织、人民政府密切配合，加强肥料现售的宣传，充分地说服群众：合作社现售肥料，是为了加速肥料资金的周转，更多地供应农民肥料，更多地满足农民生产上的需要；说明“赊销定购”是对生产确实有困难的农民的一种帮助，如果有力量能够买肥料的农民也要赊购，必然会影响对贫苦农民的帮助，不符合国家发放肥料贷款的目的。农民现购肥料是完全可能的，必须克服当前在一些干部思想中存在着的片面群众观点和不作具体切实调查的官僚主义作风。
