Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 11th: After the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" respectively published investigation reports on the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialism in the Northeast region of China, residents and medical workers from Andong, Kuandian, Fushun, Shenyang, Anshan, Jinzhou and other places who had testified during the investigations by the two investigation teams, unanimously supported the two reports.

Residents of the 21st and 26th groups of Caishi Street in Andong City, who witnessed American planes spreading poisonous insects, held a symposium after seeing the reports of the two investigation teams. The woman Feng Yi said at the meeting: "The investigation team spoke the words we wanted to say to the people of the world on our behalf. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Which mother in the world doesn't love her children? For the sake of our children, we must stop this heinous bacteriological warfare!" Residents Sun Leiren and Chu Daoyou of Langtou District and Wulongbei District in Andong City have personally seen American planes dropping poisonous insects and substances, and they expressed their complete support for the conclusions made in the reports of the two investigation teams. They demanded that the murderers who carried out bacteriological warfare be listed as war criminals and severely punished. Han Yongbin, the shopkeeper of Tongjuhe Grocery Store in Kuandian County, who discovered the bacteriological bombs dropped by American planes, said: "The investigation team asked very detailed questions when investigating the bacteriological bombs dropped by American planes. Now they are telling the people of the world everything I saw with my own eyes. No matter how the American devils try to cover up their crimes, the iron facts cannot be covered up."

Zhao Wenxiu, Liu Qingyi, and Chai Yongmian, farmers from Jiuzhan Village, Jiuzhan District, on the outskirts of Shenyang, who discovered poisonous insects dropped by American planes, jointly wrote a letter to thank the two investigation teams after seeing their reports. The letter stated: "We are Chinese farmers who love peace. We want to accuse the American aggressors of their bloodless crimes of murder. At the same time, we have the confidence and the means to crush their vicious conspiracy to carry out bacteriological warfare."

Ren Zanyi, a member of the Jinzhou Epidemic Prevention Team who testified to the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, said: "The evidence collected by the investigation team makes it impossible for the Acheson gang to deny it any longer. I believe that the report of the investigation team will further arouse the anger of peace-loving people all over the world and actively take action to stop the crime of carrying out bacteriological warfare."
