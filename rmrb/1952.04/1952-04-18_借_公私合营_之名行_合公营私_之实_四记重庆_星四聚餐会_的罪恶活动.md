Using "Public-Private Partnership" as a Pretext to Practice "Joint Public-Private Plunder"
—A Record of the Heinous Activities of the Chongqing "Star Four Dinner Party"
By our reporter Lin Li

In recent months, the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" have been desperately trying to turn their factories into "public-private partnership" enterprises. Dachuan Industrial Company, which produces asbestos tiles, in order to "partner" with the Southwest Industrial Department's Construction Company, first took out 70 million yuan in activity funds and gave it to Mou Sancai, their "mole" planted in the Construction Company, to have Mou Sancai act as an inside accomplice in plotting "public-private partnership." Yu Guiquan, manager of Shunchang Machinery Factory, even sent the activity funds for his "public-private partnership" activities directly to a certain bureau chief in the Southwest Industrial Department. Before Dalei Machinery Factory approached the Southwest Department of Agriculture and Forestry about "partnership," it first changed its factory name to "Dalei Agricultural Machinery Factory." Shanghai Machinery Factory, in order to promote "partnership," repeatedly invited the person in charge of the Machinery Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department to "visit." Before the anti-theft movement, Tianxing Factory of the "Star Four Dinner Party" had officially "partnered" with a certain unit of the Southwest Public Security Department; Hengshun, Shunchang, Xiechang, Huigong and other four factories had signed "public-private partnership" agreements with the Machinery Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department; Yuxin Steel Factory had also completed the preparatory work before "partnership"; others, such as Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory, were negotiating "partnership" with the Chongqing Public Security Bureau's fire brigade; Shanghai Machinery Factory, unable to wait for the reply from the Machinery Administration, had changed its approach to the Southwest Water Conservancy Department; and Minsheng Machinery Factory, which repairs and manufactures ships, was also in the process of "partnership" with the state-owned Yangtze River Navigation Bureau. In order to promote "public-private partnership," the "Star Four Dinner Party" planned to form a "trust" to monopolize the production of iron and steel machinery in the Southwest, composed of several factories including Hengshun, Shunchang, Shanghai, Hezuo, Huigong, Dalei, Xiechang, and Zhongnan, and named it the "Southwest Machinery Factory." It wanted to control all the projects in the Southwest "from locomotives to needles." They estimated that after the eight factories were jointly managed, the state would naturally invest. Otherwise, they would use their huge production capacity to force the state to invest, in order to achieve their so-called "public-private partnership" goal. However, this wishful thinking of the "Star Four Dinner Party" was not realized. Therefore, they changed to a separate activity method. In the process of separately promoting "public-private partnership," the "Star Four Dinner Party" on the one hand instigated its mole members to act as inside accomplices; on the other hand, launched a publicity offensive, saying that "public-private partnership" was for "implementing the Common Program" and "better serving the construction of the motherland under the leadership of the state-owned economy."

Encouraging private capital to develop in the direction of state capitalism under necessary and possible conditions is one of the economic policies stipulated in the Common Program. Before 1951, the Southwest leading organs, according to the needs of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and other construction departments, had proposed a public-private partnership proposal to several large factories in the Chongqing iron and steel machinery industry. This proposal was destroyed by the "Star Four Dinner Party." At that time, it said: "Public-private partnership is a conspiracy by the state to annex private property." They preemptively stole the state's plan to build the Southwest, especially grasping the engineering secrets of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. After comparing the state plan with the production capacity of state-owned enterprises in the Southwest at that time, they learned that the state had to place orders with private factories or entrust private factories to process; otherwise, it would be impossible to complete the engineering plan. From this, they concluded that this was a good opportunity to make a fortune, and they would definitely make a lot of money. Therefore, while refusing to partner with state-owned enterprises, they launched organized, planned, and led theft activities. According to investigation materials from all parties, the engineering cost stipulated by each factory of the "Star Four Dinner Party" was generally 100% higher than the actual price. Some crane, bridge, and ship projects were as much as 588% higher than the reasonable price. The situation of cutting corners was particularly serious. The turnouts, water pumps, and diesel engines manufactured by the factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were all unusable; the spinning machines manufactured for the Central Textile Industry Department, according to the contract, were to be repaired by the manufacturer within three months, and the manufacturer was responsible if they could not be used; therefore, these machines were manufactured to only last four months. In the manufacturing of textile machine projects alone, the factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" obtained more than 4 billion yuan in windfall profits. Therefore, people said: In the two years after liberation, the Chongqing iron and steel machinery industry had unprecedented good luck.

So, why did the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" later actively promote "public-private partnership"?

When the "Star Four Dinner Party" first proposed the requirement of "public-private partnership," advanced workers warned state personnel: "Don't be fooled. This is the capitalists trying to get rid of their burdens." In the past two years, the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party," while stealing a large amount of state property, have also created heavy burdens for themselves. The huge windfall profits they obtained were achieved in the early stage of national economic construction, taking advantage of the urgent needs of national defense construction and economic construction, and the lack of experience of state economic workers. As the national economy gradually got on the right track and everything was carried out according to plan, the fact of "urgent need" decreased; and state-owned enterprises developed rapidly, and the opportunity for private enterprises to obtain excessive windfall profits was not as great. Some engineering personnel, seeing the products of Chongqing private factories, simply refused to collect materials, and those who used materials simply refused to use them. They requested to place orders with state-owned factories and purchase from Northeast China, North China, and other places. Therefore, in recent years, the number of orders placed by the state in private factories or the number of processing products entrusted to them has relatively decreased. In addition, the rapid development of state-owned enterprises has forced capitalists to shrink their profits. However, the iron and steel machinery industry in Chongqing has grown and developed by relying on state-entrusted processing orders and excessive windfall profits. All their machinery and equipment, labor organization, and sales and marketing institutions are designed to serve processing orders and making huge profits. When these conditions have changed or are changing, their original system is no longer adapted to the needs of the new situation. Take the wage issue as an example: When Yuxin Steel Factory contracted the turnout project of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, it had no iron-making equipment or ironworkers. They used the method of raising wages to attract workers everywhere. At one time, the wages of ordinary blacksmiths were raised higher than those of lathe technicians. In contracting the textile machine project, each factory needed machine workers, so they raised the wages of machine workers higher than those of engineers. Ronghua Iron Factory once increased wages by 40%. Some factories secretly increased wages for workers, hiding it from the government and the trade union. The capitalists said: "As long as there is work to do, we are not afraid of high wages." "Anyway, the wool comes from the sheep." High wages were backed by excessive windfall profits. Now that excessive windfall profits are not easy to obtain, wages cannot be lowered. High wages are just one of the problems that capitalists have created for themselves. Everything else, such as equipment expenses, is a thistle that they have planted on their own path. It is only natural that they feel "prickly," and it is not surprising. Therefore, they shouted "no profit to be made," saying that "running a factory is a burden"; and decided to "find another way out." The so-called "public-private partnership" is to hand over this mess, this big burden, created in the pursuit of windfall profits, to the state to bear; or to use the power of the government to clear the thistles they have planted themselves. Du Yunjie, the director of Ronghua Iron Factory, said: "It is impossible for us to ask workers to lower their wages. We can only borrow the power of the government; however, the People's Government is unwilling to take the blame for us. Only public-private partnership is the way out." This is the first conspiracy of the "Star Four Dinner Party" to promote public-private partnership.

Of course, the "Star Four Dinner Party" is not just passively trying to get rid of its burdens by promoting "public-private partnership." It also has a more vicious conspiracy, which is "joint public-private plunder." Taking the several factories that have already "partnered" or are in the process of "partnering" as an example, before "partnering," they first raised the fixed assets of the factory in order to increase their equity. For example, Yuxin Steel Factory valued its machinery and equipment, building construction, existing materials and materials at 20 billion yuan, and "partnered" with state-owned enterprises. However, according to preliminary calculations by state personnel, this factory is only worth more than 15 billion yuan. During this anti-theft movement, the staff and workers made an accurate calculation and said that the factory is worth at most 9 billion yuan. That is to say, the boss of Yuxin Steel Factory has raised its fixed assets by a full 120%. Dachuan Industrial Company quoted more than 10 billion yuan to the state-owned construction company, but after verification, it was only worth 3.7 billion yuan. Hengshun, Shunchang, Huigong, Xiechang and other four factories, when signing the "Public-Private Partnership Agreement" with the Machinery Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department, although they specifically stated that they must not transfer funds or sell property by means of "public-private partnership"; however, it was confirmed during the anti-theft movement that Hengshun factory alone transferred more than 2 billion yuan of working capital elsewhere. Before and after the liberation of Chongqing, Dachuan Industrial Company transported a large number of gold, silver yuan, and valuable machines to Taiwan and near Hong Kong; in the past two years, as soon as there was cash, it was remitted overseas. While evading working capital, they also deliberately expanded their debts, attempting to have the new factory after "partnership" bear the debts, while the funds fell into their private pockets. The several factories that have already "partnered" are almost all piles of broken machines, and they immediately want the state to take money to support them. Tianxing Factory received the investment from the Public Security Department and used it up before it started production. Hengshun and other four factories had just signed an agreement with the Machinery Administration, and then refused to pay taxes, pay wages, or assign production tasks to the workers; and also provoked the workers, saying: "Public-private partnership, the state does not take money, nor does it give us work to do, so we cannot pay wages or pay taxes. What do you think we should do!" They also instigated individual employees to threaten state personnel. Saying: "If you cannot support the workers, don't partner; if you partner again, we will go back to the Shanghai head factory!" Zhou Yingbai, the manager of Hengshun Machinery Factory, also spread rumors among the capitalists, saying: "The People's Government has a black market policy. Public-private balance is false. My factory has been 'partnered' by the state." The illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" want to politically slander the government, and also want to take advantage of the convenience of "public-private partnership" to defraud the state of a large amount of investment, in order to use it as working capital for them to make huge profits. They said: "As long as public-private partnership is established, even if socialism is implemented in the future, I will not lose money, and I will definitely have a surplus." This is what the boss of Dachuan Industrial Company planned. They said that the advantage of "partnership" is that "there are no labor-capital disputes, and we can use the power of the state to force workers to work more." They want to use the convenience of the state-owned economy to buy raw materials cheaply and sell finished products at high prices. They want to use "public-private partnership" as a means of accumulating capital. Before and after the liberation of Chongqing, they had already transported a large amount of funds abroad. Now they feel that Taiwan and Hong Kong are not places to live for long, so they have transported some machinery and equipment from Taiwan and Hong Kong to other countries and opened branch factories. This is the essence of what the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" call "serving the construction of the motherland."

In order to ensure the implementation of the theft plan, the "Star Four Dinner Party" had internally decided on the list of cadres after "partnership" before promoting "partnership." Dachuan Industrial Company designed three "partnership" forms, but each form must maintain their original staffing and employee organization. Some capitalists even arrogantly named the person to be sent by the state as a representative or successor, otherwise they would not accept it. Some factories stipulated that the scope of work of the state representative was: managing workers and guaranteeing the supply of raw materials. At the same time, they planned to use the convenience of "public-private partnership" to send another group of "mole" members into state-owned enterprises or state power organs, forming a theft group that was integrated from top to bottom and connected horizontally and vertically, until the "Star Four Dinner Party" became a "private office" jointly run by public and private entities. At that time, all economic intelligence and state secrets would no longer need to be stolen, but could be "justifiably" demanded.

According to investigations from all parties, the "public-private partnership" promoted by the "Star Four Dinner Party" is a vicious conspiracy of lawless bourgeois elements, and a new theft plan when the national economy is on the right track.

    借“公私合营”之名行“合公营私”之实
    ——四记重庆“星四聚餐会”的罪恶活动
    本报记者　林里
    近半年来，“星四聚餐会”的违法资本家，极力想把自己的工厂变成“公私合营”的企业。出产石棉瓦的大川实业公司，为和西南工业部建筑公司“合营”，首先拿出七千万元的活动费，交给它安插在建筑公司的“坐探”分子牟三才，让牟三才做它策动“公私合营”的内应。顺昌机器厂经理余桂铨，竟把他活动“公私合营”的活动费，直接送到西南工业部某局长的手里。大来机器厂向西南农林部活动“合营”以前，先把他的厂名改为“大来农业机器厂”。上海机器厂为了活动“合营”，几次邀请西南工业部机械工业管理处的负责人去“参观”。到反盗窃运动以前，“星四聚餐会”的天兴厂，已和西南公安部某单位正式“合营”；恒顺、顺昌、协昌、惠工等四家工厂，已和西南工业部机械工业管理处签订了“公私合营”的协议书；渝鑫钢铁厂也已办好了“合营”前的准备工作；其他如震旦灭火器材厂，正和重庆公安局的消防队谈判“合营”；上海机器厂等不及机械处的回复，已改向西南水利部活动；修造船舶的民生机器厂，也在和国营长江航务局办理“合营”手续。为了策动“公私合营”，“星四聚餐会”曾计划把恒顺、顺昌、上海、合作、惠工、大来、协昌、中南等几家工厂组成垄断西南钢铁机器生产的“托辣斯”，命名为“西南机器厂”。它要把西南“大到火车头，小到一根针”的工程，通统掌握在自己的手里。他们估计，八厂联营以后，国家自然会来投资。否则，他们就以巨大的生产能力，迫使国家投资，达到他们所谓的“公私合营”的目的。但“星四聚餐会”的这个如意算盘没有能够实现。于是，他们就改用分头活动的方式进行。在分头策动“公私合营”的过程中，“星四聚餐会”一面唆使它的坐探分子做内应；一面展开宣传攻势，说“公私合营”是为了“执行共同纲领”，是为了“在国营经济的领导下，更好地为祖国建设事业服务”。
    在必要和可能的条件下，鼓励私人资本向国家资本主义方向发展，是共同纲领所规定了的经济政策之一。一九五一年前，西南领导机关根据修筑成渝铁路和其他建设部门的需要，曾向重庆钢铁机器业中的几家大工厂提出公私合营的建议。这个建议，被“星四聚餐会”破坏了。当时，它说：“公私合营是国家吞并私人财产的阴谋。”他们预先窃取了国家建设西南的计划，特别是掌握了成渝铁路的工程机密。他们把国家计划和西南国营企业在当时的生产能力做了对比以后，得知国家必须在私营工厂定货，或者委托私营工厂加工；否则就不可能完成工程计划。由此，他们得出结论说：这是发财致富的良机，一定可以大捞一把。于是在拒绝和国营企业合营的同时，便有组织有计划有领导地展开盗窃活动。据各方调查材料证实：“星四聚餐会”各厂规定的工程造价，一般都比实际价格要高百分之百。一些吊车、桥梁和船舶工程，竟高出合理价格百分之五百八十八。偷工减料的情况尤其严重。“星四聚餐会”各厂给成渝铁路制造的道岔、抽水机和柴油机全部不能使用；给中央纺织工业部制造的纺纱机，合同规定三个月内由制造者包修，不能使用时制造者负责；于是这些机器就造得只能用四个月。仅在制造纺织机工程中，“星四聚餐会”各厂就得到四十亿元以上的暴利。因此人们说：解放后的二年，重庆钢铁机器业交了空前未有的鸿运。
    那末，“星四聚餐会”的会员厂，后来为什么又积极策动“公私合营”呢？
    当“星四聚餐会”提出“公私合营”的要求之初，先进的工人群众便向国家工作人员发出警告说：“千万不要上当。这是资本家想丢包袱。”近二年来，“星四聚餐会”的违法资本家，在大量盗窃国家财产的同时，也给自己制造下了沉重的包袱。他们所获得的巨大暴利，是在国家经济建设的初期，乘国防建设和经济建设的急需和国家经济工作人员缺乏经验的条件下取得的。在国家经济逐步走上正轨，一切按着计划进行的情况下，“急需”的事实减少了；而且国营企业迅速发展，私营企业取得超额暴利的机会也不多了。有些工程人员，看见重庆私营工厂的出品，领料的根本不领，用料的根本不用。他们要求到国营工厂定货，到东北、华北等地购买。因此，近年来国家在私营工厂的定货，或委托他们的加工品相对地减少了。加以国营企业飞跃发展，就使资本家不得不把他们的利润加以收缩。然而，重庆的钢铁机器业，是依靠国家委托加工定货和在超额暴利中成长发展起来的。他们的一切机器设备，劳力组织，供销机构，都是为加工定货和牟取暴利服务的。在这些条件已经改变或正在改变的情况下，他们原有的制度就不适应新形势的需要了。就拿工资问题来看吧：当渝鑫钢铁厂包揽了成渝铁路的道钉工程时，没有打铁设备，也没有打铁工人。他们就以抬高工资的手段，到处拉工人。一时把普通打铁匠的工资，提高得比车床技工的工资还高了。在包揽纺织机工程中，各厂需要机器工，于是又把机器工人的工资，提高得比工程师的工资还高。荣华铁工厂曾经一次增加工资百分之四十。某些工厂曾经隐瞒着政府和工会，暗地里给工人增加工资。资本家说：“只要有活做，不怕工资高。”“反正羊毛出在羊身上。”高额工资是以超额暴利为后盾的。现在的超额暴利不容易得到了，然而工资却降不下来。高额工资仅仅是资本家自己制造下的问题之一，其他一切设备开支等等，无一不是他们自己在自己的路上种下的蒺藜。他们感到“扎手”是理所当然，不足为奇的。于是他们就叫喊着“无利可图”，说“办工厂是背包袱”；并决定要“另找出路”。所谓“公私合营”，就是把这个在贪图暴利中造成的烂摊子、大包袱，交给国家去负担；或者借政府的权力，清除他们自己种下的蒺藜。荣华铁工厂厂长杜韵杰就说：“我们叫工人降低工资是不可能的，只能借政府力量；然而人民政府又不肯替我们背黑锅，只有公私合营才是出路。”这就是“星四聚餐会”策动公私合营的第一个阴谋。
    当然，“星四聚餐会”策动“公私合营”，决不只是消极地丢包袱，它还有更恶毒的阴谋，就是“合公营私”。就以现在已经“合营”或正在办理“合营”手续的几家工厂来看，在“合营”之前，他们首先提高工厂的固定资产，借以加大股权。像渝鑫钢铁厂，把机器设备、房屋建筑、现存物资和材料，作价为二百亿元，和国营企业“合营”。但经国家人员初步
    计算，这个厂只值一百五十多亿元。这次反盗窃运动中，职工群众做了个精确计算，说这个厂顶多能值九十亿元。这就是说：渝鑫钢铁厂的老板把他的固定资产凭空提高了百分之一百二十强。大川实业公司向国营建筑公司报价是一百多亿元，后经核定只值三十七亿元。恒顺、顺昌、惠工、协昌等四家工厂，在和西南工业部机械工业管理处签订“公私合营协议书”时，虽然特别注明不得借“公私合营”而转移资金或变卖财产；但在反盗窃运动中证实，仅恒顺一厂就把二十多亿元的流动资金转往他处。大川实业公司在重庆解放前后，就把大批黄金、银元和贵重机器运往台湾和香港附近；二年来，总是一有现金就汇往海外。在逃避流动资金的同时，他们又故意扩大债务，企图要“合营”后的新厂担负，资金则落入他们的私囊了。现在已经“合营”的几家工厂，几乎都是一堆破机器，立即要国家拿钱来支持。天兴厂拿到公安部的投资，没有开始生产就用完了。恒顺等四家工厂，刚刚和机械处签订了协议书，就不交税款，不发工资，不给工人分配生产任务；并且还向工人挑拨说：“公私合营了，国家不拿钱，也不给活做，因此开不了工资，交不起税款。你们看怎么办呀！”他们还挑唆个别职工，向国家工作人员威胁。说：“你们养活不起工人就不要合营；再合营我们就要回上海总厂去了！”恒顺机器厂的经理周英柏，还在资本家中散布谣言说：“人民政府有黑市政策。公私兼顾是假的。我的工厂已被国家‘合营’了。”“星四聚餐会”的违法资本家，既想在政治上中伤政府，又想借“公私合营”的便利骗取国家的大量投资，以做他牟取暴利的流动资金。他们说：“只要公私合营了，即便将来实行社会主义，我也不会赔本，而且肯定有盈余。”大川实业公司的老板就是这样打算的。他们说：“合营”的好处是“既没有劳资纠纷，又可以借国家权力迫使工人多劳动”。他们想利用国营经济的便利，贱价购买原料，高价推销成品。他们想借“公私合营”作积累资本的手段。重庆解放前后，他们已把大批资金运往国外。现在他们感到台湾、香港也不是久居之地，因此又把台湾、香港的部分机器设备运往他国，开办了分厂。这就是“星四聚餐会”的违法资本家所说的“为祖国建设事业服务”的实质。
    为保证盗窃计划的实现，“星四聚餐会”在策动
    “合营”以前，就内定了“合营”后的干部名单。大川实业公司设计了三种“合营”形式，但每种形式都要保持他们原来的人员配备和职工编制。有的资本家竟狂妄地指名要国家派某人为代表或接办人，否则他们不予接受。有的厂规定国家代表的工作范围是：管理工人，保证原材料的供应。他们同时计划利用“公私合营”的便利，再派一批“坐探”分子打入国营企业或政权机关，结成上下一体、纵横串通的盗窃集团，直到把“星四聚餐会”变成公私联合的“办私室”。到那时，一切经济情报、国家机密，再也用不着盗窃，而可以“名正言顺”地索取了。
    根据各方面的调查证实：“星四聚餐会”策动的“公私合营”，是不法资产阶级分子的恶毒阴谋，是他们在国家经济走上正常轨道时的新的盗窃计划。
