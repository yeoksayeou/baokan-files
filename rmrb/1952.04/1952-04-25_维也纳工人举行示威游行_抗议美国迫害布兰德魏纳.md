    Vienna Workers Hold Demonstrations
    Protesting US Persecution of Brandweiner
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 24th. According to a report in the "Austrian People's Voice" on the 19th, employees of many Austrian enterprises held mass rallies on April 18th to protest the government's persecution of Professor Brandweiner by dismissing him from his professorship at the University of Graz. Many trade unions and organizations have pledged their solidarity and support, and expressed their gratitude for his courageous act of reporting the truth to the people regardless of personal consequences.
    According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on the 22nd, several thousand workers in Vienna held demonstrations last weekend to protest the US authorities' ban on Professor Brandweiner reporting on the US's bacteriological warfare in Korea. Demonstrators protested at the crossroads around a theater where the US military was holding a weekend film evening. Austrian Interior Minister Graf also criticized the US action, saying: "Austrian domestic policy matters should be handled by the Austrian security authorities, and the occupying countries do not need to interfere."

    维也纳工人举行示威游行
    抗议美国迫害布兰德魏纳
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】据“奥地利人民之声报”十九日消息，奥地利许多企业的职工在四月十八日举行群众集会，抗议政府解除布兰德魏纳教授在格拉茨大学的教授职务的迫害行为。许多工会和团体都保证对他加以声援和支持，并对他不计个人后果而向人民报告真相的勇敢行为，表示感谢。
    另据伦敦“工人日报”二十二日讯，在上星期末，维也纳好几千工人举行示威游行，抗议美国当局禁止布兰德魏纳教授报告美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的情形。示威者在美军举行周末电影晚会的一所戏院周围的路口上示威。奥地利内政部长葛拉夫也批评美国的行动说：“奥地利国内政策的事应该让奥地利治安当局去管，用不着占领国来管。”
