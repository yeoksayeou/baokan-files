    Support Our Frontline Heroes and Heroines to Defeat the American Aggressors' Bacteriological Warfare
    Dong Quanzhong, Family Member of a Martyr from Huailai County, Chahar Province
    After suffering heavy blows from our heroic sons and daughters – the Chinese People's Volunteers – the American bandits knew that they could not defeat us with airplanes and artillery and could not realize their aggressive plans. Disregarding international law and human morality, they heinously committed the heinous crime of spreading bacteria and insects, attempting to poison our heroic children and our peaceful people. They have absolutely no humanity! From ancient times to the present, no one has ever heard of anyone creating disease and disaster for others. I am the family member of a revolutionary martyr. My son, Dong Cunrui, gloriously sacrificed himself for the liberation of the Chinese people and the liberation of all mankind. I can no longer tolerate American imperialism using such vicious means against our liberated Chinese and Korean people! On behalf of all the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in Chahar Province, I lodge a serious protest against the heinous crimes of American imperialism!
    The beastly behavior of the American bandits will never scare us. We have the leadership of Chairman Mao, and we have the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world as friends. We can completely and cleanly eliminate any bacteria and insects! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, didn't we completely eliminate the germs spread by the Japanese devils? Since our heroic sons and daughters can defeat American airplanes and artillery, we also have the confidence and strength to defeat American bacteriological warfare!
    I solemnly tell the American imperialist demons! Your bacteria and insects will not scare the Chinese and Korean people. If you don't take them back soon, we will cut off your devilish claws!
    Families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers across the country! Comrades across the country! In order to defeat the American imperialists' bacteriological warfare, in order to win the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, let us act urgently, work harder to produce, strive for a bumper harvest, and actively support our heroic sons and daughters on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea, so that they can eat well, dress warmly, and have more medicines, more weapons, and more ammunition to strike the enemy more forcefully. The people of our entire village of Nanshanbao, a small mountain village in Huailai County, have full confidence and strength to smash any vicious means used by American imperialism.

    支援我们前线的英雄儿女打败美国侵略者的细菌战
    察哈尔省怀来县烈属　董全忠
    美国强盗遭到我们的英雄儿女——中国人民志愿军的沉重打击后，知道用飞机大炮打不败我们，实现不了它的侵略计划，就不顾国际公法和人类道德，穷凶极恶地干出了撒布细菌昆虫的万恶罪行，企图毒害我们的英雄子弟和我们的和平人民。它们简直没有一点人性了！从古到今也没有听说那个人给人制造病灾的事。我是个革命烈士家属，我的儿子董存瑞就是为了解放中国人民、解放全人类而光荣牺牲的。我不能再容忍美帝国主义向我们解放了的中国和朝鲜人民施这种恶毒手段！我代表察哈尔全省的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，向美帝国主义这种万恶罪行提出严重抗议！
    美国强盗这种兽性行为决吓不倒我们。我们有毛主席的领导，有苏联和全世界爱好和平人民作朋友，什么细菌昆虫我们也能彻底干净地消灭它！抗日战争时期，日本鬼子撒布的病菌，我们不是把它完全消灭了吗？我们的英雄儿女既然能够战胜美国的飞机大炮，我们也就有信心有力量打败美国的细菌战！
    我严正地告诉美帝国主义恶魔们！你们的细菌昆虫，是吓不倒中朝人民的，如不早早收起，我们一定要斩断你们的鬼爪子！
    全国革命烈士家属和革命军人家属们！全国同胞们！为了打败美帝国主义的细菌战，为了争取抗美援朝的胜利，咱们要紧张地行动起来，更加努力生产，争取丰收，积极支援咱们在抗美援朝前线的英雄儿女，让他们吃得饱，穿得暖，让他们有更多的药品，更多的武器、炮弹，更加有力地打击敌人。我们怀来县南山堡这个深山里的小村的全村人民完全有信心、有力量粉碎美帝国主义所施用的任何恶毒手段。
