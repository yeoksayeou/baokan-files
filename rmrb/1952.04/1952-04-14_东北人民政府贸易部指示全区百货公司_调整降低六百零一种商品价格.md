The Northeast People's Government Trade Department issued a directive on April 11 to the commercial departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities in Northeast China and the Northeast China Department Store, to lower the wholesale and retail listed prices of commodities operated by state-owned department stores. The directive pointed out: Since the in-depth "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, prices in free markets in various parts of Northeast China have generally stabilized and fallen; state-owned department stores in major cities outside the region, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, have successively lowered sales prices, and the prices of goods imported from outside the Northeast region have also fallen compared with before; at the same time, state-owned enterprises in various parts of Northeast China have recently placed processing orders with private factories, and in addition to price declines, the quality of goods has also improved. In view of the above situation, in order to enable the broad masses of working people to obtain the fruits of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, it was decided to adjust and lower the prices of commodities in state-owned department stores.

The standard for this price adjustment in the entire Northeast region is the Shenyang area, including a total of 18 categories of 601 commodities, with an average reduction rate of 9.8 percent. Various localities will then appropriately reduce the selling price on their own, based on this price, with reference to regional price differences, commodity price ratios, and other factors, in accordance with the regulations on pricing authority. The price reduction situation for various commodities is as follows: rubber shoes (42 types on average) reduced by 5.9 percent, petroleum reduced by 15 percent, paper (11 types on average) reduced by 6.9 percent, and currently fast-selling gold pens reduced by 1.9 to 20 percent. Among daily necessities, soap (30 types on average) reduced by 9.2 percent, toothpaste (43 types on average) reduced by 13.4 percent, plastic products reduced by 6.4 to 13.5 percent, and various socks reduced by an average of 15 percent. Enamelware and enamel utensils, which are most popular among the broad masses of workers and staff, reached 105 types, with an average reduction of 9.6 percent. Among entertainment and sports products: harmonicas (34 types on average) reduced by 15 percent, and ping-pong balls reduced by 31.8 percent. Among cosmetics, creams and vanishing creams (56 types on average) reduced by 8.5 percent. Other items such as thermos bottles, lighters, flashlights, pencils, ink, carbon paper, etc., have all had their prices specifically lowered.

   调整降低六百零一种商品价格
    【本报讯】东北人民政府贸易部在四月十一日向东北各省市商业厅、局及东北区百货公司发出降低国营百货公司所经营商品之批发零售牌价的指示。指示指出：深入“三反”、“五反”运动以来，东北各地自由市场物价普遍稳落；关内北京、天津、上海等主要城市国营百货公司先后调低销货牌价，东北区区外进货价格亦因此较前下跌；同时东北区各地国营企业最近向私营厂商加工订货，除价格下落外，货品质量方面亦有提高。鉴于以上情况，为使广大劳动人民得到伟大“三反”、“五反”运动的成果，决定调整降低国营百货公司商品价格。
    东北全区这次调整价格以沈阳地区为标准，共包括商品十八类六百零一种，平均调低率为百分之九点八，各地则依据此价格参照地区差价、品种比价等情况，依作价权限规定，自行适当调低卖价。各种商品的减价情形如胶鞋（四十二种平均）减低百分之五点九，石油减低百分之十五，纸张（十一种平均）减低百分之六点九，目前销路畅快的金笔减低百分之一点九到百分之二十，日用品中的香皂（三十种平均）减低百分之九点二，牙膏（四十三种平均）减低百分之十三点四，塑胶制品减低百分之六点四到十三点五，各种袜子平均减低百分之十五，广大职工最喜爱用的搪瓷、珐琅器皿达一百零五种，平均减低百分之九点六。娱乐品与运动品中：口琴（三十四种平均）减低了百分之十五，乒乓球减低百分之三十一点八。化妆品中的香脂、雪花膏（五十六种平均）减低百分之八点五。其他如热水瓶、打火机、手电筒、铅笔、墨水、复写纸等均具体地调低了价格。
