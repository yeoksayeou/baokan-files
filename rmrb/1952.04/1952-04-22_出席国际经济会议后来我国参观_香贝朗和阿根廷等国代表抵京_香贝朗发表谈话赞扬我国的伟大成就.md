Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Mr. Chambelland, Secretary-General of the International Trade Promotion Committee, and his wife; nine representatives from Argentina, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, and Venezuela who attended the International Economic Conference in Moscow, accompanied by Ji Chao-ding, Secretary-General of the Chinese Delegation to the International Economic Conference, arrived in Beijing by plane on the afternoon of the 21st for a visit. Those who welcomed them at the airport included: Liu Ningyi, member of the International Trade Promotion Committee, Xue Muqiao, Deputy Director of the Chinese Economic Society, Xiang Shuxiang, member of the Preparatory Office of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Sun Xiaocun, Standing Committee member of the Democratic National Construction Association, Fu Huating, Director of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, Chen Dingmin, professor at Tsinghua University, and others. Jiang Ming, Deputy Director of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, also welcomed them at the airport.

The list of representatives from various countries is as follows:

    Kuneo: Argentine engineer, representative of the agricultural trade union;
    Pinnel: Representative of the Argentine Agricultural Producers Association;
    Badesi: Argentine economist, businessman;
    Miller: Canadian importer and exporter, young economist;
    Wanigatunga: Ceylonese businessman;
    Rolando Acevedo: President of the Chilean Printing Trade Union;
    Hartoyo: Indonesian agricultural worker representative;
    Otillo Siria: Mexican importer and exporter;
    Kapoulis: Venezuelan journalist.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Mr. Chambelland, Secretary-General of the International Trade Promotion Committee and former member of the French National Assembly, made the following statement to our reporter upon arriving in Beijing:

    I came to China after attending the International Economic Conference in Moscow. Industrialists, businessmen, economists, experts, trade union and cooperative workers from all countries who are willing to work for international economic cooperation can participate in this conference. The conference was held from April 3rd to 12th and was attended by 471 representatives from 49 countries. The Chinese delegation, due to its large size and the importance of its members, had a great impact on the conference.

    The Moscow conference has achieved great results, which exceeded the expectations of the preparatory committee. This is primarily due to the number of participants and the importance of the personnel. We believe that the delegations from various countries attending the conference were representative, able to represent different areas of the economy in their respective countries, and that the representatives had different political beliefs. The most important fact is that although those present had different political views, the conference reached a consensus. The conference studied the current state of international economic relations and concluded that artificial barriers were hindering current international trade and causing various economic difficulties in some countries. The speeches of the representatives of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries at the conference showed that developing trade relations with these countries would be of great benefit to Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Australia. All attendees reached a conclusion that the recovery and development of commerce between countries is currently possible, and that the different economic and social systems of countries are not obstacles to trade between them.

    Therefore, all attendees unanimously decided to make a recommendation to the United Nations, requesting it to convene a conference of government representatives from various countries, inviting representatives from business circles, trade unions, and other social organizations to participate, to study international trade issues. The conference believed that if People's China could not participate in this conference, then this conference could not become a truly international conference.

    The Moscow conference was not a theoretical discussion, but a practical effort to quickly eliminate artificial barriers hindering the development of trade between countries. During the conference, representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries signed important trade agreements with representatives from capitalist countries.

    In order to continue the achievements of the conference, we have organized the International Trade Promotion Committee. It is very reasonable that there are three important Chinese figures participating in the committee. This is because of the importance of New China in the world and the important role it can play economically due to its rapid development.

    This is my first time to China. This is a good opportunity for me to see its continuous development in this country with my own eyes. The French people express their solidarity with the Chinese people who are struggling to build a new life. The French people have always followed the Chinese people's liberation movement with great sympathy. Today, the Chinese people have embarked on a new path, which is undoubtedly their path to prosperity. New China is carrying out great construction to improve the people's living conditions. This great action can only be achieved by peace-loving people.

    I firmly believe in the peace-loving intentions of the Chinese people and their leaders. The French people are willing to work together with the Chinese people for lasting peace.

    出席国际经济会议后来我国参观
    香贝朗和阿根廷等国代表抵京
    香贝朗发表谈话赞扬我国的伟大成就
    【新华社二十一日讯】国际贸易促进委员会秘书长香贝朗及其夫人；出席在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议的阿根廷、加拿大、锡兰、智利、印度尼西亚、墨西哥和委内瑞拉的代表九人，由我国出席国际经济会议代表团秘书长冀朝鼎陪同，在二十一日下午搭飞机抵达北京参观。到机场欢迎的有：国际贸易促进委员会委员刘宁一、中国经济学会副主任委员薛暮桥、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处委员项叔翔、民主建国会总会常务委员孙晓村、北京市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭、清华大校教授陈定民等多人。中央人民政府贸易部国外贸易司副司长江明也到机场欢迎。
    各国代表名单如下：
    库内俄  阿根廷工程师、农业工会代表；
    平奈尔  阿根廷农业生产者协会代表；
    巴得西  阿根廷经济学者、商人；
    米勒  加拿大进出口商、青年经济学者；

    【新华社二十一日讯】国际贸易促进委员会秘书长、前法国国民议会议员香贝朗，在抵达北京后对本社记者发表谈话如下：
    我是在莫斯科参加国际经济会议之后来到中国的。凡是愿意为国际经济合作而工作的各国工业家、商业家、经济学家、专家、工会和合作社工作者，都可以参加这次会议。会议已在四月三日到十二日举行，出席会议的有四十九个国家的四百七十一位代表。中国代表团由于人数众多及其组成人员的重要，在会议上产生了很大的影响。
    莫斯科会议已获得了很大的成就，这些成就是出乎筹备委员会预料之外的。这首先是由于参加会议的人数，其次是由于人员的重要。我们认为出席会议的各国代表团都有代表性，都能代表各国经济的不同领域，而且代表们都有着不同的政治信仰。最重要的事实是：虽然到会者的政见不同，但是会议却获得了一致的意见。这次会议曾研究了当前国际经济关系的情况，认为人为的屏障阻碍了目前的国际贸易，而且是造成某些国家种种经济困难的原因。苏联、中国及各人民民主国家的代表在会议上的发言都表明：和这些国家发展贸易关系，对于西欧、美洲东南亚和澳洲国家，是有很大的利益的。全体到会者得到了一个结论，认为各国的商业的恢复和发展在目前是可能的，同时认为各国经济、社会制度不同，并不是各国进行贸易的障碍。
    因此，全体到会者一致决定向联合国提出建议，要求它召集一个各国政府代表的会议，邀请各国商业界、工会代表和其他社会团体参加，来研究国际贸易问题。会议认为如果人民中国不能参加这个会议，那么这个会议就不可能成为真正的国际会议。
    莫斯科会议不是理论上的讨论，而是实际上的努力，以便迅速消除阻碍各国贸易发展的人为障碍。在会议过程中，苏联、中国及各人民民主国家的代表，曾与资本主义国家的代表签订了重要的贸易协议书。
    为了继续会议的成就，我们组织了国际贸易促进委员会。委员会中有三位重要的中国人物参加，这是非常合理的。这是因为新中国在全世界的重要性，及其在经济上由于迅速发展而能够起的重要作用。
    我是第一次到中国来。这对我是一个很好的机会，使我能够在这个国家亲眼看见它的不断发展。法国人民对于为了建立新的生活而斗争的中国人民表示休戚与共。法国人民一直用非常大的同情心注视着中国人民的解放运动。今天中国人民已经走上了一条新的道路，这条道路无疑地是他们走向繁荣的道路。新中国正在进行伟大的建设，来改善人民的生活条件。这种伟大的行动只有爱好和平的人民才能实现。
    我坚信中国人民及其领袖的爱好和平的意愿。法国人民谨和中国人民一道为持久和平而努力。
