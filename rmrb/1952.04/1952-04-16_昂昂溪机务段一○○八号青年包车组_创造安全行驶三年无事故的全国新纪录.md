    Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot's No. 1008 Youth Package Team
    Creates National Record of Three Years of Accident-Free Safe Driving
    The nationally renowned No. 1008 Youth Package Team of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway has demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm, having safely travelled 352,871.2 kilometers, creating a new national record of three years (from April 1, 1949, to March 31, 1952) without accidents.
    After the establishment of the China Changchun Railway Administration in May of the year before last, this package team, with the help of Soviet expert Malikiianov, learned the Soviet advanced experience—the Lunin-style locomotive maintenance method, gradually achieving craftsman-like skills among the crew members, doing their own washing and inspection work, and increasing work efficiency sevenfold. Because the quality of the locomotive is constantly maintained in excellent condition, even in the severe cold of the northern Manchurian snow and wind, it often hauls more than 3,500 tons and saves coal. During the patriotic competition last year, it saved the country 1.36 billion yuan. This package team pioneered the record of 623 kilometers per day in the 500-kilometer movement. This package team has always been a leader in the entire section in hauling more and running faster, driving the entire section to launch a 500-kilometer competition craze of exceeding axle load and full load. Now, this package team is full of victorious confidence and is striving for the goal of safe driving of 400,000 kilometers, saving 500 million yuan throughout the year, and breaking through the million-kilometer overhaul mark. To welcome "May Day," they have already issued a competition challenge to model locomotive package teams such as Nos. 304, 884, and 105. (Hai Yang) (Attached picture)

    昂昂溪机务段一○○八号青年包车组
    创造安全行驶三年无事故的全国新纪录
    全国闻名的中长铁路昂昂溪机务段一○○八号青年包车组，发挥了高度的劳动积极性，已安全行驶三十五万二千八百七十一点二公里，创造了三年（从一九四九年四月一日到一九五二年三月三十一日）无事故的全国新纪录。
    前年五月，中长铁路管理局成立之后，这个包车组在苏联专家马力基雅诺夫帮助下，学习了苏联先进经验——鲁宁式保养机车法，逐渐达到乘务员工匠化，自作洗检工作，提高了工作效率七倍。由于机车质量经常保持优良，虽在冬季严寒的北满风雪中，经常牵引三千五百多吨，并节省了用煤。在去年爱国主义竞赛期间，为国家节省了十三亿六千多万元。这个包车组在五百公里运动中，首创日车六百二十三公里的纪录。这个包车组始终是全段多拉快跑的带头者，带动了全段掀起超轴满载的五百公里竞赛热潮。现在，这个包车组正满怀胜利信心向安全行驶四十万公里、全年节约五亿元和为突破百万公里大修的目标而奋斗。他们为迎接“五一”，已向三○四号、八八四号、一○五号等模范机车包乘组提出竞赛挑战。　　　（海洋）（附图片）
