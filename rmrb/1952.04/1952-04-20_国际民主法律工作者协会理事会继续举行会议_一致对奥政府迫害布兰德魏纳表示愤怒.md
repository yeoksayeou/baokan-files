Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 19th: The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers continued its meeting on the 18th. At the meeting, participants listened to and discussed the report by Kovács, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Association of Legal Workers, on "Protecting Democratic Rights," and the report by Benjamin, Vice President of the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic, on "The Peace Treaty with Germany and its Basis in International Law."

During the morning session, Kovács, in his report, emphasized that recently, in imperialist countries, incidents of violating basic democratic rights have become more and more numerous and increasingly unscrupulous. He cited examples to illustrate how human rights have been trampled in Greece, Spain, Yugoslavia, the United States, France, and other countries. The trial and execution of Beloyannis, the Greek fighter for peace and freedom, is the most prominent example illustrating the imperialist police rule and the violation of basic human rights.

Benjamin then delivered her report. She first pointed out that seven years have passed since the end of the war, and it is the first time in history that a major country like Germany has not yet concluded a peace treaty after such a long period. She then emphasized that this situation poses a great danger to the German people and to peace. She concluded by saying that the German people's struggle for a just and democratic peace treaty is fully in accordance with international law, and the German people are fully justified under international law to demand the conclusion of a democratic and just peace treaty.

Subsequently, the meeting began to discuss the two reports. Those who spoke during the morning discussion included Polish representative Muszka and Soviet representative Djordin, among others.

The afternoon session continued the discussion of the reports. Those who spoke during the discussion included Brazilian representative Palmera, Polish representative Jedlowski, Czechoslovak representative Baduska, and Trieste representative Krishaverly, among others. They unanimously pointed out that the International Association of Democratic Lawyers must launch a struggle to defend democratic rights from the arbitrary rule of the imperialists and must do everything possible to promote a peaceful solution to the German question.

After the discussions, the various committees began drafting draft resolutions on the various issues discussed at the meeting.

During the meeting, participants learned that the Austrian government, at the behest of the United States, persecuted Brandweiner, an outstanding peace fighter and head of the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigating American war crimes, and removed him from his position as a professor at the University of Graz. All the delegates to the meeting felt immense anger at this news.

    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会继续举行会议
    一致对奥政府迫害布兰德魏纳表示愤怒
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会在十八日继续举行会议。会上，与会者听取并讨论了匈牙利法律工作者协会总书记科瓦奇关于“保护民主权利”的报告，和德意志民主共和国最高法院副院长班雅民关于“对德和约及其在国际法上的根据”的报告。
    上午会议上，科瓦奇在发表报告时强调指出：最近，在帝国主义国家内，侵犯基本民主权利的事件愈来愈多，而且愈来愈肆无忌惮了。他引述了一些例子，说明在希腊、西班牙、南斯拉夫、美国、法国和其他一些国家内，人权是如何遭到蹂躏。希腊争取和平自由的战士贝劳扬尼斯之被审讯和杀害，就是说明帝国主义的警察统治和侵犯基本人权的最显著的例子。
    班雅民继起发表报告。她首先指出：战争结束后已经过了七年，德国这样一个大国在这样长的时期内仍然没有缔结和约，这在历史上还是第一次。接着她强调说：这样一种情况，对德国人民及和平都有着巨大的危险。她最后说：德国人民争取缔结公正、民主的和约，是完全符合国际法的，德国人民根据国际法完全有理由要求缔结民主和公正的和约。
    接着，会议开始就这两个报告展开讨论。上午讨论中发言的有波兰代表穆士卡、苏联代表杰伊丁等人。
    下午会议继续讨论报告，讨论中发言的有巴西代表巴墨拉、波兰代表叶德洛夫斯基、捷克斯洛伐克代表巴杜斯卡、的里雅斯特代表克里沙弗利等人。他们一致指出：国际民主法协必须展开一个保卫民主权利免受帝国主义者专横统治的斗争，并须竭尽全力以促进德国问题的和平解决。
    讨论结束后，各委员会即开始起草关于会上所讨论的各种问题的决议草案。
    与会者在会议进行当中获悉，奥地利政府奉美国的意旨，迫害杰出的和平战士、国际民主法律工作者协会调查美国战争罪行调查团团长布兰德魏纳，免去了他的格拉茨大学教授的职位。会议全体代表对这消息莫不感到无比的愤怒。
