Volume Two of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" contains 41 works by Comrade Mao Zedong from the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in July 1937 to the repulse of the second anti-communist upsurge launched by Chiang Kai-shek in May 1941. Important works included are "The Policy, Method and Prospects of Resisting Japanese Aggression," "Strive to Win Victory in the War of Resistance by Mobilizing All Forces," "Combat Liberalism," "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," "Strategic Issues in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare," "On Protracted War," "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War," "The Issue of Independence and Autonomy within the United Front," "Problems of War and Strategy," "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "Talk with New China Daily Correspondents on the New International Situation," "The Identity of Soviet Interests with the Interests of Mankind," "Foreword to 'The Communist'," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People," "On New Democracy," "The Issue of Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas," "Current Tactical Issues in the Anti-Japanese United Front," "Boldly Develop Anti-Japanese Forces and Resist the Attacks of Anti-Communist Diehards," "On Policy," "Summary of the Repulse of the Second Anti-Communist Upsurge," "On Contradiction," and others.

"The Policy, Method and Prospects of Resisting Japanese Aggression" and "Strive to Win Victory in the War of Resistance by Mobilizing All Forces" are works by Comrade Mao Zedong at the very beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In these two documents, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the two fundamentally different lines existing on the issue of the War of Resistance Against Japan: one represented by the proletariat and the masses of the people, represented by the Communist Party, and the other represented by the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, represented by the Kuomintang. This struggle between the two lines of the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong at the very beginning of the war, ran through the entire eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

In the report "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically pointed out the principled divergence between the Communist Party's proposition for resisting Japan and the Kuomintang's proposition for resisting Japan, namely, the former was "a complete national revolutionary war advocating the total mobilization of the people," and the latter was "a one-sided resistance war of a pure government without the participation of the masses of the people," and pointed out that the latter's "one-sided resistance war is bound to lead the war to failure." Comrade Mao Zedong explained: "After the Lugouqiao Incident, the main dangerous tendency within the Party is no longer 'left' leaning closed-doorism, but has turned to right-leaning opportunism, i.e., capitulationism." He continued to emphasize that every Communist Party member should not forget the bloody lesson of Chen Duxiu's capitulationism in 1927, and put forward the principle of independence and autonomy within the united front, advocating expanding and consolidating the left-wing group, winning over the middle group, and isolating the right-wing group in the united front.

The two works "Strategic Issues in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare" and "On Protracted War" are Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific analysis of the war issue and the brilliant strategic plan for developing people's war proposed at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Based on the comparison of strength between China and Japan and the comparison of domestic class forces, as well as the possible changes in all these force comparisons, Comrade Mao Zedong opposed the "theory of national subjugation" and the "theory of quick victory," predicted that the War of Resistance Against Japan would inevitably be a protracted war, and that victory would be achieved through three stages: defense, stalemate, and counter-offensive. Based on this situation, and contrary to right-leaning opportunism, Comrade Mao Zedong planned how the proletarian vanguard should organize the people's forces, how to go through a strategic period of the people's independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, and then reach another strategic period of the people's anti-Japanese regular warfare, and strive to develop the War of Resistance Against Japan into a victorious outcome for the people.

The article "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War" explained the issue of the Communist Party members' serious shouldering of the major historical responsibility of leading the national war. Based on the specific experience of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong made specific and concise expositions on various aspects of the Party's high degree of proletarian seriousness and correct organizational line of close contact with the masses. The section on learning in this report profoundly explained that if the Party is to be able to shoulder a series of great historical tasks, it must first raise the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism of the entire Party. The great call made by Comrade Mao Zedong here to apply Marxism-Leninism to the conditions in China once aroused a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism within the Party.

"The Issue of Independence and Autonomy within the United Front" and "Problems of War and Strategy" - these were two issues that were interconnected in the Party's political line at that time. In these two works, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the erroneous appeasementism on the issue of the united front, and criticized the erroneous idea of not daring to expand the liberated areas and expand the people's war in the Japanese-occupied areas, and pinning the hope of defeating the Japanese invaders on the Kuomintang army and pinning the fate of the people on the legal movement under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. These two works are the basic summary of the line struggle that occurred within the Party at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and are of great significance in unifying the Party's work pace.

"Talk with New China Daily Correspondents on the New International Situation" made a clear analysis of the complex and changing international situation at that time, cleared up some ideological confusion inside and outside the Party, and put forward the policies that the Party must adopt at that time. The article "The Identity of Soviet Interests with the Interests of Mankind" explained this issue related to the fate of the people of all countries by analyzing some world situation issues of concern to everyone at that time. For the Chinese people, this is an extremely important document related to the alliance between the people of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union.

In the "Foreword to 'The Communist'," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out three basic issues of our Party in the Chinese revolution: the issue of the united front, the issue of armed struggle, and the issue of Party building. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "Correctly understanding these three issues and their interrelationships is equivalent to correctly leading the entire Chinese revolution." Regarding the issue of both uniting and struggling with the bourgeoisie, regarding the issue that "in China, without armed struggle, there would be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution," regarding the issue of the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong gave a profound historical exposition here.

The booklet "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" gave a concise and popular explanation of the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution.

"On New Democracy" is a work of great historical significance. Based on the fundamental changes in the international (the proletarian socialist revolution began and won victory in Russia) and domestic (the proletariat became the leading force of the Chinese revolution) historical situation, as well as the new experience of the Chinese revolution in the past twenty years, Comrade Mao Zedong developed Lenin and Stalin's theory on colonial and semi-colonial revolutions, distinguished between the old democracy and the new democracy of the Chinese revolution, two different historical periods and two different historical categories, and solved the theoretical problem of the construction of the Chinese new democratic state and the preparation for entering socialism, crushing the reactionary dream of establishing a bourgeois dictatorship in China. This is a complete Marxist theoretical work on the Chinese revolution. This book played a great mobilizing and organizing role in the Chinese people's liberation struggle and the construction of a new China, thus greatly strengthening the Chinese revolution. The articles "Overcoming the Danger of Capitulation and Striving for a Turn for the Better in the Situation," "Current Tactical Issues in the Anti-Japanese United Front," "Boldly Develop Anti-Japanese Forces and Resist the Attacks of Anti-Communist Diehards," "On Policy," "Summary of the Repulse of the Second Anti-Communist Upsurge," etc., are works by Comrade Mao Zedong in leading our Party to carry out extremely serious and repeated struggles against the Kuomintang's capitulation and anti-communist policies in the War of Resistance Against Japan. These documents continued to develop and further concretize the policy of both unity and struggle on the issue of the united front, mobilized the masses to repel the anti-communist upsurge of the Kuomintang, and corrected the mistake of some comrades who were still influenced by capitulationist ideas and dared not boldly develop revolutionary forces.

In the document "The Issue of Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas," Comrade Mao Zedong stipulated that the political power in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas must be the political power of all people who approve of resisting Japan and also approve of democracy, that is, the democratic dictatorship of several revolutionary classes united against traitors and reactionaries. This anti-Japanese base area regime of revolutionary united front led by the Communist Party and with the participation of representatives of the masses of the people played a great role in the Party's implementation of the policy of developing progressive forces, winning over middle forces, and isolating stubborn forces at that time.

The first edition of Volume Two of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" contains Comrade Mao Zedong's other philosophical work, "On Contradiction." In this outstanding Marxist militant document, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the rich experience of the Chinese revolution, developed the materialist dialectics of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and profoundly elaborated on all aspects of the law of the unity of opposites, which is the core of the dialectical method, especially focusing on elaborating on the issue of the particularity of contradictions; severely criticized the "refusal to do any arduous research work on concrete things," "do not understand the differences in various revolutionary situations, and therefore do not understand that different methods should be used to solve different contradictions, but only use a self-proclaimed unchangeable formula to apply everywhere" that subjective, one-sided, and superficial erroneous way of thinking of the dogmatists. This work is Comrade Mao Zedong's important contribution to the treasure house of Marxist philosophy. (Attached picture)

专栏：

    毛泽东选集第二卷出版
    【本报讯】中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会主持出版的“毛泽东选集”，其第二卷已由人民出版社出版，自今日起由全国各地新华书店发行。
    “毛泽东选集”第二卷是毛泽东同志从一九三七年七月抗日战争爆发，至一九四一年五月打退蒋介石发动的第二次反共高潮时期的著作，共计四十一篇。其中所包括的重要著作，有“反对日本进攻的方针、办法和前途”、“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”、“反对自由主义”、“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”、“抗日游击战争的战略问题”、“论持久战”、“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”、“统一战线中的独立自主问题”、“战争和战略问题”、“青年运动的方向”、“关于国际新形势对新华日报记者的谈话”、“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”、“‘共产党人’发刊词”、“中国革命和中国共产党”、“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”、“新民主主义论”、“抗日根据地的政权问题”、“目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题”、“放手发展抗日力量，抵抗反共顽固派的进攻”、“论政策”、“关于打退第二次反共高潮的总结”、“矛盾论”等等。
    “反对日本进攻的方针、办法和前途”与“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”，是毛泽东同志在抗日战争刚开始时的著作。在这两个文件中，毛泽东同志分析了抗日战争问题上所存在的两条基本不同的路线，即一条以共产党为代表的无产阶级和人民大众的路线，以及另一条以国民党为代表的大地主大资产阶级的路线。这一在战争刚刚开始便为毛泽东同志所指出的共产党与国民党之间的两条路线的斗争，贯穿于整整八年时间的抗日战争的过程中。
    在“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”的报告里，毛泽东同志强调地指出了共产党的抗战主张和国民党的抗战主张的原则分歧，即前者是“主张全国人民总动员的完全的民族革命战争”，后者是“不要人民群众参加的单纯政府的片面抗战”，并指出后者的“片面抗战是一定要引导战争趋于失败的”。毛泽东同志说明：“在芦沟桥事变以后，党内的主要危险倾向，已经不是‘左’倾关门主义，而转变到右倾机会主义，即投降主义方面了。”他继续强调每一个共产党员都不应忘记一九二七年陈独秀投降主义的血的教训，提出了统一战线中的独立自主原则，主张在统一战线中扩大与巩固左翼集团、争取中间集团和孤立右翼集团。
     “抗日游击战争的战略问题”和“论持久战”两部著作，是毛泽东同志在抗日战争初期就战争问题所作的科学分析及所提出的发展人民战争的英明战略计划。毛泽东同志根据中日力量的对比与国内阶级力量的对比，以及这一切力量对比的可能变化，反对了“亡国论”与“速胜论”，预见了抗日战争必将是持久战，而经过防御、相持、反攻三个阶段以获得胜利。毛泽东同志又根据这种情况，和右倾机会主义相反，计划无产阶级先锋队如何组织人民的力量，如何经过人民独立自主的游击战争的一个战略时期，再达到人民抗日正规战争的另一个战略时期，而争取抗日战争的发展成为人民胜利的结局。
    “中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”一文，说明了共产党人应当认真地负起领导民族战争的重大历史责任的问题。毛泽东同志根据中国革命的具体经验，把党的高度的无产阶级严肃性和密切联系群众的正确的组织路线的各个方面，作了具体而扼要的阐释。这篇报告的论学习一节，深刻地说明了党要能够负起一系列的伟大的历史任务，首先必须提高全党的马克思列宁主义的思想水平。毛泽东同志在这里所作的把马克思列宁主义应用于中国条件的伟大号召，曾经在党内引起一个学习马克思列宁主义的高潮。
    “统一战线中的独立自主问题”与“战争和战略问题”——这是当时在党的政治路线上互相联结的两个问题。毛泽东同志在这两篇著作中，批判了关于统一战线问题上的错误的迁就主义，批判了不敢在日本占领区扩大解放区和扩大人民战争、而把战胜日寇的希望寄托于国民党军队以及把人民的命运寄托于蒋介石反动统治下的合法运动的错误思想。这两篇著作是毛泽东同志关于抗日战争初期党内发生的路线争论的基本总结，在统一党的工作步调上有很重大的意义。
    “关于国际新形势对新华日报记者的谈话”，对于当时复杂变化的国际形势作了鲜明的分析，扫除了党内外一些思想上的混乱，提出了党在当时必须采取的政策。 “苏联利益和人类利益的一致”一文，从分析当时大家所关心的一些世界时局问题，说明了这个有关各国人民命运的问题。对于中国人民来说，这是有关中苏两大国人民联盟的一篇极其重要的文献。
    在“‘共产党人’发刊词”里，毛泽东同志指出了我们党在中国革命中的三个基本问题：统一战线问题、武装斗争问题、党的建设问题。毛泽东同志写道：“正确地理解了这三个问题及其相互关系，就等于正确地领导了全部中国革命。”关于同资产阶级又联合又斗争的问题，关于“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利”的问题，关于马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之统一的问题，毛泽东同志在这里有了深刻的历史的阐明。
    “中国革命和中国共产党”这本小册子，对于中国革命的根本问题，作了扼要的通俗的说明。
    “新民主主义论”是一本有重大历史意义的著作。毛泽东同志根据国际（开始了无产阶级的社会主义革命并在俄国获得胜利）国内（无产阶级成为中国革命的领导力量）历史情况的根本变化，以及中国革命二十年中的新经验，发展了列宁斯大林关于殖民地半殖民地革命的理论，区别了中国革命的旧民主主义与新民主主义两个不同历史时期、两个不同历史范畴，解决了中国新民主主义国家建设与准备进到社会主义的理论问题，粉碎了关于在中国建立资产阶级专政的反动梦想。这是一本关于中国革命的完整的马克思主义理论著作。这本书对于中国人民的解放斗争与建设新中国，起了极大的动员作用与组织作用，因而极大地加强了中国革命。 “克服投降危险，力争时局好转”、“目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题”、“放手发展抗日力量，抵抗反共顽固派的进攻”、“论政策”、“关于打退第二次反共高潮的总结”等文，是毛泽东同志领导我们党在抗日战争中和国民党的投降反共政策进行极严重的反复斗争中的作品。这些文件继续发挥了并更加具体化了关于统一战线问题上的又团结又斗争的政策，动员了群众打退国民党的反共高潮，纠正了一部分同志还受投降主义思想影响而不敢放手发展革命力量的错误。
    在“抗日根据地的政权问题”这个文件里，毛泽东同志规定了抗日根据地的政权必须是一切赞成抗日又赞成民主的人们的政权，亦即几个革命阶级联合起来对于汉奸反动派的民主专政。这种以共产党为领导的、有人民大众的代表参加的、革命统一战线的抗日根据地政权，对于当时党实行发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力的政策，起了很大的作用。
    第一版的“毛泽东选集”第二卷，刊载了毛泽东同志的另一篇哲学著作“矛盾论”。在这篇杰出的马克思主义的战斗文献里，毛泽东同志根据中国革命的丰富经验，发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的唯物辩证法，极其深刻地阐发了作为辩证方法的核心的对立统一法则的各个方面，特别是着重地阐发了关于矛盾的特殊性的问题；严厉地批判了教条主义者的“拒绝对于具体事物做任何艰苦的研究工作”，“不了解诸种革命情况的区别，因而也不了解应当用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，而只是千篇一律地使用一种自以为不可改变的公式到处硬套”的那种主观的、片面的与表面的错误思想方法。这篇著作是毛泽东同志对于马克思主义哲学宝库的重要贡献。（附图片）
