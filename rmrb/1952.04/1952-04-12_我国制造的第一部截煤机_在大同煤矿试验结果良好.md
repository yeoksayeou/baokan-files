China's First Coal Cutting Machine

Proves Successful in Tests at Datong Coal Mine

    The workers of Taiyuan Machinery Factory manufactured China's first coal cutting machine last September. In order to assess the machine's effectiveness in practical operation and find a basis for further improvement, two tests were conducted at the Datong Mining Bureau's First Mine in December of last year and March of this year, respectively. The test results were positive. Participants included technical inspectors, technicians, and workers from the Taiyuan Machinery Factory, technical personnel and coal cutting machine operators from the Datong Mining Bureau, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and its affiliated Coal Mine Administration Bureau, and the Machine Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government.

    All participants felt honored to participate in this historically significant testing operation. Upon hearing that the first coal cutting machine made in New China had arrived at the mine, the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau's First Mine rushed to see it after work, even before eating. When the coal cutting machine was started up and ran idle in the mine, the workers applauded enthusiastically, and every coal cutting machine operator eagerly volunteered to participate in the tests and to operate the first coal cutting machine made in China. During the second test, Soviet expert Comrade Denisov personally participated in guiding the work.

    The coal quality at the Datong Mining Bureau's First Mine is relatively hard, but during the tests, the fast cutting speed, slow cutting speed, and traction efficiency of the coal cutting machine all met or approached the prescribed standards, and were close to the standards of the Soviet-made 65-horsepower coal cutting machine. The participants and the Soviet expert expressed satisfaction with the test results. Coal cutting machine operator Jia Xinmin believed that this coal cutting machine far surpassed those manufactured by capitalist countries in all aspects and was much easier to operate than other coal cutting machines. The Soviet expert was also deeply moved during the tests, saying, "Based on the test results, it is proven that this batch of coal cutting machines can be used. It is truly great that New China can produce such accurate machines in just two or three years since its founding!" Denisov also pointed out that the main shortcomings of the machine were unqualified material selection and insufficient consideration of the conditions that should be met when selecting materials; many materials that should have been heat-treated were not heat-treated. He added that quality inspections should be strictly carried out in the future, and the prescribed technical conditions should be followed. The technical inspection personnel of the Taiyuan Machinery Factory made detailed records of the test situation and the Soviet expert's comments and prepared to bring them back for discussion and research among the workers in order to make improvements in future mass production.

    我国制造的第一部截煤机
    在大同煤矿试验结果良好
    太原机器厂职工在去年九月份造成了中国的第一部截煤机。为了鉴别截煤机在实际操作中的效能，找出进一步改进的依据，在去年十二月和今年三月份已先后在大同矿务局第一矿进行了两次试验。试验结果良好。参加试验的人员，有太原机器厂技术检查人员、技术员和工人，大同矿务局的技术人员和截煤机手，中央人民政府燃料工业部和所属煤矿管理总局、中央人民政府重工业部机器工业局都派有代表参加。
    参加试验的人员，都为参加这次有历史意义的试验操作而感到光荣。大同矿务局第一矿职工听说新中国第一部截煤机到了矿上，下了班饭都顾不得吃就争着去看截煤机。当截煤机在矿上开动空转时，职工们热烈鼓掌，每个截煤机手都争着参加试验，都争着充当中国制造的第一部截煤机的机手。在第二次试验中，苏联专家捷尼索夫亲自参加指导。
    大同矿务局第一矿的煤质较硬，但在试验中截煤机的快截速度、慢切速度、牵引效率等，都达到或接近规定的标准，也接近了苏联制造的六十五马力截煤机的标准。参加试验的人员和苏联专家，对试验的结果都表示满意。截煤机手贾新民认为这部截煤机在各方面都远远地超过资本主义国家制造的截煤机，在操作上比其他的截煤机都顺手得多。在试验中苏联专家也很受感动，他说：“根据试验的结果，证明这一批截煤机是可以用了。新中国诞生两三年中，能造出这样的机器，又是这样的准确，太伟大了！”捷尼索夫并指出了这个机器的缺点主要是选料不合格，在选用材料时应具备的条件考虑不够，很多应该热处理的材料没有经过热处理；今后应严格地进行质量检查和遵守规定的技术条件。太原机器厂技术检查人员，对试验的情况和苏联专家的意见都作了详细的记载，准备带回去在职工中进行讨论研究，以便在今后大批制造中求得改进。
