    Examining the Neglect of Studying Newspapers and Deviation

    Comrade Editor: The "Reader's Letter" in the People's Daily on March 29 pointed out the shortcomings of many staff members in our company neglecting to read the newspaper. This criticism served as a wake-up call and prompted us to further examine the newspaper reading situation among our company's staff. The situation of our company's personnel not reading the newspaper is indeed widespread. The main reason, as pointed out in the newspaper, is that leading cadres have not paid attention to newspaper reading work, have not given staff members certain newspaper reading time, and have not guided them in their studies. This is the result of some leading cadres not deeply understanding the importance of the Party newspaper from a political point of view, but only one-sidedly emphasizing business work.

    In order to thoroughly correct this phenomenon, we have successively convened meetings of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to criticize and review the ideological roots of the above-mentioned errors, and have decided on specific measures to strengthen the company's personnel's newspaper reading work in the future. It was also emphasized that cadres should understand ideologically that the Party newspaper is an important weapon for improving everyone's ideological level and guiding work, and that everyone should develop the habit of reading the newspaper.

    We express our heartfelt gratitude to the People's Daily for the suggestions it has given us.

                                   China National Department Store Beijing Company

### 中国百货公司北京市公司  检查忽视学习报纸的偏向

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国百货公司北京市公司
    检查忽视学习报纸的偏向
    编辑同志：三月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”指出我公司很多工作人员忽视读报的缺点。这一批评给我们敲了警钟，促使我们进一步检查了我公司工作人员读报的情况。我公司人员不读报的情况确实是普遍地存在着。主要原因，正如报上所指出的，是领导干部没有注意读报工作，没有给工作人员一定的读报时间，更没有领导他们学习。这是某些领导干部没有深刻地从政治意义上体会党报的重要性，只是片面地强调业务工作的结果。
    为了彻底纠正这种现象，我们已相继召开了党、行政、工会、青年团的会议，批判和检讨了产生上述错误的思想根源，决定了加强今后公司人员读报工作的具体办法；并强调指出，干部要从思想上认识党报是提高大家思想水平和指导工作的重要武器，要大家养成读报的习惯。
    我们对人民日报给我们提示的意见，表示衷心的感激。
                                   中国百货公司北京市公司
