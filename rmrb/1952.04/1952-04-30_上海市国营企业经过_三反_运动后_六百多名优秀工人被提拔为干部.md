Shanghai: After the "Three-Anti" campaign, some state-owned and public factories in Shanghai, as well as the Shanghai Branch of the Shanghai Railway Administration, have promoted 668 outstanding workers to work in leadership positions at all levels. Among them, 337 were promoted to positions at or above the section chief level, more than 260 to positions at or above the group leader level, and 19 workers were promoted to deputy factory director. Currently, the work of promoting outstanding workers to leadership cadres in various factories has become a mass movement as the "Three-Anti" campaign enters the construction phase.

In the "Three-Anti" struggle, a large number of outstanding workers emerged in various factories. After grafters and bureaucrats with poor qualities and styles were removed, they were successively promoted to leadership cadres at all levels. The promotion of these cadres generally went through three steps: mass recommendation, leadership approval, and announcement at a general meeting. Therefore, they are all worker cadres with high prestige among the masses. For example, the 19 newly promoted section chiefs, group leaders, and other cadres of the Shanghai Telephone Company have all been workers with 20 to 30 years of service, possessing skilled technology and production experience, and are loved by the masses. Some were model figures who resolutely fought against profiteers and grafters in the "Three-Anti" campaign, and some were old workers who had consistently worked actively and had not been discovered for a long time.

When these newly promoted workers took on new jobs, they received warm congratulations from the vast number of workers. The workers praised each other and said, "In the Mao Zedong era, a talent will not be buried." Many factory workers took practical actions such as increasing production and reducing waste products as congratulatory gifts. For example, after Xin Quan'gen, a fitter at the No. 2 Factory of China Textile Machinery Company, was promoted to deputy factory director, all the employees of the factory put forward 67 rationalization proposals and assured the new deputy factory director: "We will resolutely complete 450 looms in April and increase them to 600 in May." The employees of the Shanghai Chemical Plant used new achievements to congratulate technician Zhang Qifu on being promoted to deputy factory director. The output of spray rubber hoses in the rubber department of the plant increased by 20% per shift, and the scrap rate decreased from 2% to less than 1%; the production task of Grade A yellow wax cloth in the insulation material department was also overfulfilled by 60%.

After these promoted worker cadres took on new jobs, they constantly overcame various difficulties and made production better than before. Not long after Yang Shaochang, a foundry worker at the Shanghai Huafeng Steel Plant, became deputy factory director, the engineer of the foundry workshop was suspended from duty due to corruption, but the furnace opening work had to proceed as usual. At that time, Yang Shaochang, who had rich experience, carefully studied with the old workers and engineers of the testing department and solved important problems such as ingredient proportioning. As a result, the first batch of molten iron they mastered was not only on time, but also had a scrap rate that was one-third lower than before. When the second furnace was opened, the scrap rate was reduced by two-thirds. After Zhang Shibao, a national model worker, became the chief engineer in charge of the boiler repair department, he put forward methods to reduce the occurrence of accidents. He said: "In the past, machines controlled us, but now we want to control machines." In the past, boilers were repaired after they broke down, which wasted repair time and delayed production. Now, Zhang Shibao plans a reporting system, and in cooperation with the operation department, records the operation of the boiler every day. When the boiler has an abnormal phenomenon, it is immediately repaired, so as to "eliminate accidents in the report." After Yu Chunyin was promoted to deputy director of general affairs at Maigen Road Station of the Shanghai Railway Branch, he established a review system for material payment slips and improved material supply work. He himself not only humbly learns, but also launched a mutual aid learning system. In the past, in the general affairs office, the clerk did not manage materials, and those in charge of materials did not understand accounting. One person's leave would affect the entire work. Yu Chunyin actively promoted everyone to learn from each other. Facts have proved that these newly promoted worker cadres are fully capable of overcoming all new difficulties. Zheng Wenjie, a planer worker who was promoted to the head of the materials section of the Shanghai Wusong Machine Factory, said: "I have low education and am not familiar with the business; but with the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, humbly accepting other people's opinions, and stepping up learning, difficulties can be completely overcome."

### 上海市国营企业经过“三反”运动后  六百多名优秀工人被提拔为干部

    上海市国营企业经过“三反”运动后
    六百多名优秀工人被提拔为干部
    上海市经过“三反”运动的部分国营、公营工厂及上海铁路管理局上海分局，已有六百六十八名优秀工人被提拔到各级领导岗位上工作。其中提升为科长以上的有三百三十七人，股长以上的有二百六十多人，并有十九个工人被提升为副厂长。目前各工厂提拔优秀工人为领导干部的工作，已成为“三反”运动进入建设阶段的一种群众性运动。
    各厂在“三反”斗争中大批涌现出来的优秀工人，在贪污分子及品质、作风恶劣的官僚主义分子被撤换以后，就陆续地被提拔为各级领导干部。这些干部被提拔起来，大体经过群众推荐、领导批准、大会宣布等三个步骤，因此都是在群众中很有威信的工人干部。如上海电话公司新提拔的十九名科长、股长等干部，都是有二三十年工龄，具有熟练的技术和生产经验，为群众所爱戴的工人。有的是在“三反”运动中坚决和奸商、贪污分子作斗争的模范人物，有的是一贯工作积极、长期没有被发现的老工人。
    当这些新提拔的工人走上新的工作岗位时，得到了广大工人热烈的祝贺。工人们交口称道：“在毛泽东时代，是不会被埋没一个人才的。”不少工厂的工人都以增加生产、减少废品等实际行动来作为贺礼。如中国纺织机械公司第二厂提升钳工忻全根为副厂长后，全厂职工提出了六十七件合理化建议，并向新副厂长保证：“在四月份内，坚决完成四百五十台织布机，五月份并增加到六百台。”上海化工厂的职工以新的成绩来祝贺技工张启富被提为副厂长，该厂橡胶部的喷雾胶管，每班生产量增加了百分之二十，废品率从百分之二降低到百分之一以下；绝缘器材部的甲级黄腊布生产任务也超额百分之六十完成。
    这些被提拔的工人干部担负起新的工作后，不断克服各种困难，把生产搞得比原来更好。上海华丰钢铁厂翻砂工人杨绍昌当了副厂长后不久，翻砂间的工程师因为贪污停职，但是鼓风炉的开炉工作要照常进行。当时，具有丰富经验的杨绍昌就找老工人和化验部工程师仔细研究，解决了配料等重要问题，结果他们掌握开出来的第一炉铁水，不但准时，而且废品率比以前减少了三分之一。到开第二炉的时候，废品率更减少了三分之二。全国劳动模范张世宝担任锅炉修理部主管工程师后，就提出了减少发生事故的办法。他说：“过去机器控制我们，现在我们要控制机器。”以前是在锅炉发生毛病后再去检修，又费抢修时间、又耽误了生产。现在张世宝计划了一种报表制度，和运转部配合，每天把锅炉的运转等方面情况记录下来，当锅炉一有不正常现象，立刻检修，做到“把事故消灭在报表里”。上海铁路分局提拔于春银担任麦根路站总务副主任后，建立了材料支付单的复核制度，改进了材料供应工作。他本人不仅虚心学习，并且发动大家建立了互助学习制度。过去总务室里，做文书的不管材料，管材料工作的不懂会计，一人请假就影响整个工作。于春银积极推动大家互相学习。事实证明：这些新提拔的工人干部是完全有能力克服一切新的困难的。上海吴淞机器厂提拔为材料科长的刨床工人郑文杰说：“我文化低，业务也不熟悉；但是有党的领导，有群众依靠，虚心接受别人意见，加紧学习，困难是完全可以克服的。”（新华社）
