Summary of Letters

    The profiteer Hao Yuezhang of Taiyuan City should be severely punished for beating workers and sabotaging the anti-theft movement.
    Hao Yuezhang, a profiteer from the Yuezhang Belt Shop in Taiyuan City, committed assault and battery against workers and resisted the anti-theft movement. On March 10th, the workers of the work team continued to persuade Hao Yuezhang to thoroughly confess his illegal activities, but he acted shamelessly and threatened the workers by attempting to jump into a well. Soon after, taking advantage of everyone going home for dinner, he brutally beat workers Liang Yuxi and Liu Xiang. The masses discovered this and stopped his lawless behavior. I demand that the government punish this profiteer who is sabotaging the anti-theft movement.　Zhang Yushu

    太原市奸商郝岳章殴打工人破坏反盗窃运动应受严惩
    太原市岳章补带行奸商郝岳章行凶殴打工人，抵抗反盗窃运动。三月十日，工作组的工人继续说服郝岳章，要他彻底坦白违法行为，但他耍无赖，以跳井威胁工人。不久，他乘大家回家吃饭，毒打工人梁玉玺、刘相。群众发觉后，才阻止了他这种无法无天的行为。我要求政府惩办这个破坏反盗窃运动的奸商。　张玉枢
