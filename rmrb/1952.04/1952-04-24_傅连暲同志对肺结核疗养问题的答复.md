Comrade Fu Lianzhang Answers Questions on Tuberculosis Treatment

To the Editor:

After my article "Experiences in Tuberculosis Treatment" was published in the People's Daily on February 15th, many readers from various places wrote to me, expressing that the article had been enlightening and helpful to them, and raised some specific questions requesting answers. Because I am quite busy with work, I have not been able to reply to each one individually. Some readers hoped that I could examine and treat them, but due to work constraints, I cannot leave my post and cannot fulfill their wishes. I apologize for this and will provide a comprehensive answer to the questions raised by readers as follows:

One, the question of whether tuberculosis patients can work like healthy people after recovery: My opinion is that when the body is in the recovery period and has not yet stabilized, it still needs attention and recuperation. However, health can be fully restored, and after recovery, one can work like other healthy people. My ability to persist in work for more than twenty years is an example. There are many other similar examples. Some comrades have excessive fear and anxiety about tuberculosis, or doubt whether they can recover, or worry whether they can work like healthy people after recovery. Some people even think that once they get tuberculosis, it seems that their entire career and future will be ruined. This is all excessive worry. Generally, tuberculosis can be completely restored to health as long as it is treated and recuperated properly; after recovering health, one can work like a healthy person.

Two, the issue of rest and activity: People with severe tuberculosis should avoid all major physical and mental fluctuations (such as hemoptysis, fever, bacteria in sputum, etc., which require stopping work and resting), and should also have certain restrictions on sexual life. People with tuberculosis should avoid pregnancy. Patients with mild, inactive tuberculosis may benefit from some light activities, such as appropriate walks, light work, etc., but digging soil and planting flowers are not suitable.

Three, the issue of sunlight and fresh air: People bask in the sun mainly to absorb ultraviolet rays. People can get reflected sunlight in courtyards or under trees, which will achieve the same effect as sunbathing. Direct exposure to the scorching sun can cause adverse reactions in tuberculosis patients.

Breathing fresh air is very important, but care should be taken not to be stimulated by excessively cold air. Another important issue to be raised here is to avoid all respiratory infectious diseases, such as upper respiratory tract inflammation, bronchitis, colds, etc. Because the onset of these diseases has an adverse effect on tuberculosis itself.

Four, tuberculin was used in the era when there were no antibiotics twenty or thirty years ago, and it played a certain role at that time. The streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid (P.A.S.), etc. commonly used now are indeed much more effective than tuberculin; and they are convenient to use and less dangerous. Therefore, tuberculin has rarely been used recently. Streptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid are sold in pharmacies in major cities; however, these drugs must be used under the guidance of a doctor. Abuse of drugs will affect the subsequent treatment effect and the course of the disease. We cannot simply rely on drugs, but neglect the use of the natural environment and regular, appropriate living and suitable nutritional conditions, because these conditions are basic factors in the treatment of tuberculosis.

Five, the issue of diet and nutrition: This issue is very important for tuberculosis patients. Patients also need various nutrients like healthy people need, and when it does not hinder gastrointestinal digestion and conditions permit, they need to increase nutrition. It is best to have fixed meals and quantities. I have no experience with whether eating "garlic" is good for tuberculosis, but people with poor gastrointestinal function should not eat it to avoid irritation; it should not be eaten when vomiting blood or having a fever.

My article and today's reply can only solve general problems. As for each person's specific situation, please consult a doctor for examination and decision; and rely on developing hygienic habits, and more importantly, have a revolutionary optimistic spirit.

专栏：读者来信

    傅连暲同志对肺结核疗养问题的答复
    编辑同志：我写的“肺结核疗养的经验”一文二月十五日在人民日报上发表后，各地许多读者给我来信，表示这篇文章对他们有所启发和帮助，并提出了一些具体问题要求解答。我因工作比较忙，未能一一作复。个别读者希望我能给他检查医治，也因工作关系，不能远离，不能如愿，我在此表示歉意，并把读者所提问题综合答复如下：
    一、肺结核患者痊愈后能否像健康人一样地工作的问题：我的意见是，当身体在恢复期间而还没有稳固时，仍然需要注意调养。但健康是完全可以恢复的，恢复后也可以像其他健康人一样地工作。我二十多年来能够坚持工作，就是一个例子。其他同样的例子也很多。某些同志对肺结核有着过度的恐惧和焦虑，或者怀疑能否痊愈，或者顾虑痊愈后是否能像健康人一样地工作。有的人甚至认为一旦得了结核病，好像一生的事业和前途都将因此断送了似的。这都是过虑。一般的结核病，只要疗养得法，是完全可以恢复健康的；恢复健康后，可以像健康人一样地工作。
    二、静养和活动问题：患有较重的结核病的人，应避免一切体力和精神的巨大波动（如有咯血、发烧、痰中带菌等现象，须要停止工作，休息静养），对性生活也要有一定的节制，有肺结核病的人应该避免怀孕。轻性非活动性的肺结核患者，作些轻微的活动是有益的，例如适当的散步，轻微的工作等，但挖土、栽种花木等则不适宜。
    三、日光和新鲜空气的问题：人晒太阳主要是为了吸收紫外线。人在庭院或树荫下可得到反射的阳光，会收到晒太阳同样的效果。烈日直射会使肺结核患者发生不良的反应。
    呼吸新鲜空气是很重要的，但应注意不要受过冷的空气刺激。这里要提出的另一重要问题，就是避免一切呼吸系统的传染病，如上呼吸道发炎，或支气管炎、感冒等。因为这些病症的发作，对肺结核本身有不良的影响。
    四、结核菌素是二三十年前没有抗生素的时代用的，在当时起了一定的作用。现在所常用的链霉素、对胺柳酸（P·A·S·）等，确比结核菌素的效力要好得多；而且用法方便，危险少。所以，近来结核菌素已很少有人用了。链霉素和对胺柳酸各大城市药房都出售；但此等药品，必须在医生指导下使用，如果滥用药品反会影响以后的治疗效果和病程。我们更不能单纯地依赖药品，而忽略利用大自然环境和经常适当的规律的生活及适宜的营养条件，因为这些条件都是疗养结核病的基本因素。
    五、饮食营养问题：这个问题对肺结核患者甚为重要。病人也需要像健康人所需要的各种营养，并且在不妨碍肠胃消化及条件许可时，更需要增加营养。最好要定食定量。吃“蒜”对肺结核有无好处我没有经验，但肠胃不好的人最好不吃，以免刺激；吐血发烧时也不能吃。
    我的那篇文章和今天的答复，都只能解决一般性的问题。至于每个人的具体情况，还得请医生检查决定；并且要依靠自己养成卫生习惯，更要有革命的乐观主义精神。傅连暲
