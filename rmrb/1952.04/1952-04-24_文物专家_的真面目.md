The corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie takes many forms, one of which is expertism.

“If you master mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you don't need to fear anyone.” This kind of thinking is the most common. People who study science often have the absurd expression, "I am an expert, you need me, I am just like this, what can you do to me!"

In the past, private property was above all else. The state established schools, but it was "big doors wide open, no money, no entry." Since education became the privilege of landlords and the bourgeoisie, knowledge also became the patent of landlords and the bourgeoisie. Take bibliography in library science and the authentication of calligraphy and paintings in Chinese art as examples. China is the country that invented printing earliest. Woodblock printing began in the Tang and Song dynasties, and it was extraordinarily exquisite. These rare books printed in the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, because they became less and less common, gradually passed into the hands of emperors, officials, and landlords, becoming their decorations. Book collectors like the owners of Tianyige in the Ming Dynasty and Haiyuange, Bisonglou, and Jiayetang in the Qing Dynasty were all officials; the owners of Jigu Pavilion, Shugutang, Shiliju, Baqianjuanlou, and Tieqintongjianlou were all landlords. As for the Qianlong Emperor's Tianlu Linlang collection, it was the culmination of generations of collections. The collection of calligraphy and paintings, like rare books, was also concentrated in the hands of emperors, officials, and landlords.

Since books, calligraphy, and paintings were all monopolized by emperors, officials, and landlords, these people had the best opportunities to appreciate and conduct comparative research. Therefore, people who specialized in bibliography and could authenticate calligraphy and paintings were either officials and landlords in the past, or people who had close relationships with officials and landlords, such as staff and distinguished guests. Xiang Zijing, Sun Chengze, Huang Pilie, and Gu Qianli of the Ming and Qing dynasties can illustrate this point. These old-style experts, relying solely on monopolizing materials and having broad knowledge, could almost immediately tell the difference between genuine and fake, good and bad; this is called the "aura" school.

In recent decades, the emperors have fallen, and a new group of capitalists and compradors has risen. They have accumulated capital and engaged in speculation and profiteering. Their attention has also turned to rare books and calligraphy and paintings. Things gather where they are loved, so the ranks of book collectors and calligraphy and painting collectors have been joined by capitalists and compradors. On the one hand, they are pursuing elegance, and on the other hand, they may as well use it as a noble business, even acting as brokers for imperialism. People full of the stench of money always like to cover their corruption with the fragrance of books; throughout history, at home and abroad, this is always the case. During this period, although we also established some libraries and museums, what they collected was just a little bit of leftovers spat out by officials, landlords, capitalists, and compradors. Exquisite items still exist in private hands. This is a typical example of how semi-colonial and semi-feudal history is reflected in culture.

For people who are not officials, landlords, capitalists, or compradors, to become a bibliographer or a calligraphy and painting connoisseur is indeed not an easy task. Materials are scattered everywhere, monopolized in private hands; even if they are stored in public libraries and museums, without connections, they cannot be seen. Therefore, those who engage in bibliography and calligraphy and painting must get close to these people and the cliques they form. And they must also be patient, accumulate long-term experience, and carefully study and ponder before they can achieve something. They use completely manual methods, without textbooks or teachers, relying on cleverness and agility, learning a few tricks whenever they can. Therefore, the training of such experts takes one or two decades.

Throughout their lives, they interact with officials, landlords, capitalists, compradors, academic cliques, and cunning booksellers and antique dealers, and what they do is巧取豪奪 (cunning acquisition and violent seizure), cheating, stealing, and other speculative businesses. They are selfish and self-serving; they keep secrets and always hold back; they keep new materials secret; they are private and forgetful of the public; they only see personal interests and do not see the interests of the people. Finally, they develop to the point of monopolizing all materials,一心只想 (wholeheartedly) wanting to become "老子天下第一!" (I am number one in the world!). After liberation, a bibliography expert was constantly calculating day and night, preparing to "liberate" someone's collection this year, and preparing to "liberate" someone's collection next year. What he called "liberation" was a disguised form of monopoly, because everything was being "liberated" into his hands.

I call these experts "cultural relics experts." Under the guise of "experts" or "connoisseurs," they occupy libraries, museums, and other cultural relics institutions. Some of them are themselves "cultural merchants," and some are "moles" sent in by capitalists. Because there are these "cultural merchants" and "moles," acting as bridges for unscrupulous merchants, the state's libraries and museums have become warehouses for unscrupulous merchants, and those experts have become warehouse managers for unscrupulous merchants. Some of them use the method of抽梁換柱 (replacing the beams and pillars), replacing old manuscripts with new manuscripts, and replacing old editions of fine prints with other editions or later prints. And they steal in large quantities, developing into group actions, with division of labor, cooperation, transportation, and economics, all in an orderly and well-organized manner. They collude with unscrupulous merchants outside and agents of imperialism, echoing each other. Their肆無忌憚 (unbridled) behavior is such that these "experts" or "connoisseurs" steal cultural relics in large quantities, and then, after their selection and authentication, they are bought back at a heavy price, still returning to their old home. And the agents of imperialism are also there following the catalog,按圖索驥 (following the map to find the horse). Thus, the "go abroad trip" has become the way to get rich in the old book and cultural relics industry. For decades, the country's books and cultural relics have been eroded by these "experts," bringing countless losses and disasters to the people and the culture of the motherland.

Through the great "Three-Anti" Movement, the original forms of these experts have been revealed. In fact, they are "cultural merchants," they are "moles." And their behavior is no less恶劣狡詐 (despicable and cunning) than that of unscrupulous merchants. They are sinners against the people and the culture of the motherland. The people have been lenient enough to these elements, as long as they can thoroughly confess,革面洗心 (turn over a new leaf), and start anew, establishing the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, the people will allow them to return to their ranks.

But some people have different views. One type is those "experts" themselves. They think that they are experts, and it took them decades to learn a set of skills. Therefore, they consider themselves special people and think that the people should not make things too difficult for them. For example, when it comes to confessing problems, confessing a little is enough, and it is too embarrassing to pursue it further. I have seen such an expert, who said: "I and so-and-so have spent twenty or thirty years each learning specialized skills. We are like a knife, will the people still need this knife in the future?" When speaking, he was气势汹汹 (aggressive), as if he had a belly full of grievances. In fact, he has accumulated decades of experience in stealing national cultural relics. There is also another kind of well-intentioned person who thinks that these experts do have specialized skills, and it is not easy to find people now, so why not be more lenient?

We believe that the above two views are incorrect. The eyes of the people are very clear: if the handle of the knife is handed over to the people, even if it is a paper cutter, the people will cherish it. If the handle of the knife is not handed over to the people, and they still hold it in their own hands, and they still want to hurt people at every opportunity; even if it is a valuable sword, it must be taken away, or even destroyed. We cherish experts, we cherish experts who wholeheartedly serve the people, not experts who harm the people. In the past, experts, such as bibliographers and calligraphy and painting authentication experts, took a lot of effort to cultivate. The reason why it takes so long is because the materials are monopolized in private hands, not concentrated or made public, and comparative research is difficult. In the new society, the phenomenon of monopoly has been eliminated, and rare books and famous calligraphy and paintings of past dynasties should belong to the state and be managed centrally. At this time, not only is comparative research easier, but also scientific instruments such as microscopes, ultraviolet light, and chemical analysis can be used to identify paper, organization, color composition, and seek scientific basis, on the one hand, to make it a true science, criticize the pseudo-science of the "aura" school; on the other hand, the time to cultivate an expert can be greatly shortened, what used to take ten or twenty years may now take only three or five years.

Like the views of the "experts" themselves mentioned above, they are extremely ugly and shameless. If they are not thoroughly reformed, they will cut themselves off from the people; we will not be threatened by them. But for all experts who are willing to wholeheartedly and unreservedly serve the people, the people will welcome them.

    “文物专家”的真面目
    向达
    资产阶级的腐朽思想有各种各样，其中一种就是专家思想。
    “学会数理化，谁来也不怕”。这种想法算是最普通的了。学科学的人因此常有“我是一个专家，你们需要我，我就是这样，你们其奈我何！”的荒谬表示。
    过去的社会里，私有的财产高于一切。国家设立学校，也是“大门大大开，无钱莫进来。”受教育既然成为地主资产阶级的特权，于是知识也成为地主资产阶级的专利。就拿图书馆学中的版本学和中国艺术中的书画鉴定两项来说吧。中国是印刷术发明最早的国家，唐宋以来开始木版刻书，精美异常。这些宋、元、明、清刻印的善本书籍，因为流传日少，逐渐转到帝王、官僚、地主的手里，成为他们的装饰品。藏书家如明朝的天一阁、清朝的海源阁、皕宋楼、嘉业堂的主人，都是官僚出身；汲古阁、述古堂、士礼居、八千卷楼、铁琴铜剑楼的主人，都是地主出身。至于清朝皇帝的天禄琳琅，那更是集历代之大成了。书画的收藏，和善本书籍一样，也是集中到帝王、官僚、地主的手里。
    图书书画既然都为帝王官僚地主所垄断，所以这些人有最好的机会去欣赏、作比较研究。于是专精版本和能鉴别书画的人，过去如非官僚地主，就是和官僚地主有密切关系的人，像幕僚清客之流。明清两代的项子京、孙承泽、黄丕烈、顾千里诸人，正可以说明此点。这些旧式专家，单凭着垄断材料，见多识广，真假好坏，几于一望而知；此之谓望气派。
    近几十年来，帝王垮了，新起一批资本家和买办，他们积聚了资本，作囤积居奇投机倒把的买卖。他们的目光也转到善本书和书画方面。物聚于所好，于是藏书家和书画收藏家中，又添上了资本家和买办一流人物。一方面附庸风雅，一方面也无妨以此为清高的买卖，甚至于替帝国主义作掮客。满身铜臭的人，总喜欢用书香来掩盖他的腐朽；历观中外，无不皆然。在这时期，我们虽然也兴办了一些图书馆和博物馆，所收藏的不过是官僚、地主、资本家和买办吐出来的一点剩余，精美之品仍然散存在私人的手里。这是半殖民地半封建的历史反映在文化上面的一个典型例子。
    非官僚、地主、资本家、买办出身的人，要想成为一个版本学家或书画鉴赏家，的确不是一件容易的事。材料分散各处，垄断在私人手里；藏在公家图书馆博物馆里的，不讲关系，也是看不到的。因此搞版本搞书画的，总得靠近这些人，以及这些人所构成的阀。并且还要有耐心，积累长期的经验，仔细揣摩，才能有所成就。他们完全用的是手工业方式，没有课本，没有老师，靠聪明机伶，偷几手就得几手。所以这种专家的养成，一来就得一二十年。
    他们一生所交往的，既是官僚、地主、资本家、买办、学阀，以及刁滑的书商和古董商人，所干的也就是巧取、豪夺、欺骗、偷盗等等投机取巧的买卖。他们自私自利；秘密技术，什么都留一手；得到一点新材料，秘不示人；私尔忘公；只看见个人的利益，不看见人民的利益。最后发展到垄断一切材料，一心只想成为“老子天下第一！”解放后一位版本专家口口声声日日夜夜地在那里算计，今年预备“解放”某人收藏，明年又预备“解放”某人收藏。他所谓“解放”，就是变相的垄断，因为都
    “解”到他那里去了。
    我把这种专家称之为“文物专家”。他们以“专家”或“行家”的身分，盘据在图书馆博物馆以及其他文物机关里面。有的本身行迳就是“文化商人”，有的就是资本家派进来的“坐探”。因为有了这批“文化商人”和“坐探”，作了奸商的桥梁，于是国家的图书馆和博物馆竟成为奸商的仓库，而那些专家们无形中也就成为奸商们的仓库主任。他们有的用抽梁换柱的办法，把旧抄本换成新抄本，把旧版精印换成别本或后印。并且大量偷盗，发展成为集团行动，分工、合作、运输、经济，部勒井然，组织严密。同外面的奸商以及帝国主义的代理人，里应外合，互通声气。其肆无忌惮竟至于由这些“专家”或“行家”们将文物大批地偷盗出去，然后又部分地经过他们的选择和鉴定，花了重价，仍然回到老家。而帝国主义代理人也在那里照着目录，按图索骥。于是走洋庄成为旧书业和文物业的致富之道。几十年来，国家的图书文物就是这样地为那些“专家”们所侵蚀，给人民、给祖国的文化带来了数不清的损失和灾害。
    经过伟大的“三反”运动，把这些专家的原形都照出来了。其实就是“文化商人”，就是“坐探”。而行为之恶劣狡诈，和奸商也并不相上下。他们是人民是祖国文化的罪人。人民对于这些分子是够宽大的了，只要他们能彻底坦白，革面洗心，从新作人，树立起全心全意为人民服务的精神，人民是允许他们回到自己的队伍里来的。
    但是有些人的看法却不一样。一种人就是那些“专家”自己。他们自以为他们是专家，花了好几十年的工夫，才学会一套本事。因此自居于特殊人物，以为人民不应该过分地为难他们。比如说交代问题吧，交代一点就可以了，穷追未免太难堪了。我就见到这样的一个专家，他说：“我同某某都是花了二三十年的工夫各人学有专长。我们像一把刀，将来人民还要不要我们这把刀？”说时气势汹汹，好像一肚子委屈，其实呢，他偷盗国家文物，已积数十年之经验。还有一种好心肠的人，以为像这些专家们，的确是学有专长，现在不容易找人，不如马虎一点吧。
    我们以为上面的两种看法都是不对的。人民的眼睛看得很清楚：如其将刀把交给人民，那怕是裁纸小刀，人民都很爱惜的。如其刀把不肯交给人民，仍然抓在自己手里，一有机会还要伤人；那怕就是太阿宝剑，也要把它夺过来，甚至于消灭它。我们爱惜专家，爱惜全心全意为人民服务的专家，而不是爱惜危害人民的专家。过去的专家，像版本家和书画鉴别专家，是花了很大的工夫才能养成的。所以要花这样长的工夫，是因为材料都垄断在私人的手里，并不集中，也不公开，研究比较困难。在新社会里，消灭了垄断的现象，善本图书历代有名书画都应归诸国家，集中管理。这时候不仅比较研究来得容易，并且还可以借科学仪器如显微镜紫外光以及化学分析，来鉴定纸张、组织、颜色成分、求得科学的根据，一面使之成为真正的科学，批判掉望气派的假科学；一面可以将培养一个专家的时间大大地缩短，以往要花十年二十年的，现在也许三五年就够了。
    像上面所举“专家”自己的看法，那是极端丑恶和无耻的，如果不彻底改造，他们就将自绝于人民；我们也不会受他们的要挟。但对于一切愿意全心全意毫无保留地为人民服务的专家，人民都将表示欢迎。
