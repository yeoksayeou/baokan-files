    As a result of the aggressive bloc headed by the United States pursuing arms expansion and war preparations, the economic crisis in the entire capitalist world has further developed.
    First of all, the畸形development of the war industry in capitalist countries has caused a sharp reduction in civilian industry, and factories have closed down one after another. According to the "U.S. News & World Report" published on February 15th, production in the United States of steel, aircraft, machinery (mainly weapons and machines for producing weapons), transportation equipment (mainly military vehicles, tanks, etc.), and petroleum, all related to military production, has increased significantly. On the other hand, most civilian production has been greatly reduced. Compared with the peak production period in mid-1950, household goods have decreased by more than one-third, wool fabrics by about one-third, cotton fabrics by more than one-fifth, rayon products by nearly one-third, butter by about one-quarter, shoes by more than one-quarter, radios and televisions by nearly three-fifths, and civilian housing construction has decreased by more than one-quarter due to the priority allocation of construction materials to military use. The situation in Britain is similar. Under the influence of the priority system for the military industry, the production of some non-military machinery, electrical, and chemical manufacturing industries in Britain has been greatly reduced. At the beginning of this year, the London "Financial Times" predicted that in the central region of Britain, an important industrial center, the production volume of general machinery manufacturing would decrease by 30 to 40 percent. Automobile production in 1951 had already decreased by 10 percent compared to 1950, and production in many other industries, such as clothing, knitting, wool, yarn, and furniture, had also generally declined. According to an announcement by the British Cotton Control Board on March 14th, 43 yarn mills across the country have closed down, and the weekly cotton yarn production has dropped sharply to 16.57 million pounds, a decrease of 5.13 million pounds compared to the same week last year, nearly one-quarter of the total production. Due to the sharp reduction in civilian production, even with the expansion of military production, the industrial production volume of capitalist countries has still decreased. For example, although the military production of the United States has increased threefold compared to last year, the total industrial output of the United States has decreased by 2 percent compared to the peak reached before the Korean War. According to a recent report by U.S. President Truman to Congress, the military production of Western Europe, including Britain, has tripled in the past two years, but at the same time, the rate of increase in the total industrial production of Britain has clearly decreased. The statistics from the "Economist" weekly indicate that the production increase rate in 1951 decreased by nearly 70 percent compared to 1950. By December of last year, the total production volume of Britain not only stopped increasing but actually decreased to below the level of January last year. This fact seriously shattered the dreams of those capitalists who thought that massive expansion of armaments could "prosper" the economy. Even the American "Business Week" cannot help but sadly admit: "Arms expansion is no longer enough to sustain prosperity. The pessimism arising from the realization of this is impossible to conceal."
    Simultaneous with the 畸形development of military production, inflation is also impacting the economic foundations of capitalist countries with ever-increasing force. This severe inflation has caused huge disturbances in the commodity circulation market, leading to rising prices and a general decrease in the sales of consumer goods. In the United States, from the beginning of 1950 to October 1951, the cost of living had risen by 20 percent. At the same time, there was an undersupply of steel, petroleum, machine tools, and other so-called "national defense production" items, while there was a very serious backlog of civilian goods. For example, clothing sales decreased by one-eighth compared to the peak after the Korean War, automobiles decreased by about one-third, and the sales volume of the entire retail industry decreased by 9.5 percent compared to the peak. Department store sales decreased by about 12 percent compared to the peak in early 1951. In Britain, the cost of living also increased by 25 percent last year, and the consumption of various items generally decreased. According to British official statistics, the third quarter of last year decreased by 3 percent compared to the same period in 1950. Among them, food decreased by 0.6 percent, shoes decreased by 22.7 percent, other clothing decreased by 20.5 percent, and household goods decreased by 14.6 percent. The situation in other capitalist countries in Western Europe is also similarly serious. Prices in France have generally risen, with flour prices rising by 48 percent, bread prices by 38 percent, and vegetable oil and sugar prices by 23 percent. The "Financial News" of the Danish financial community published an article by Professor Peterson, pointing out that from 1939 to 1950, the prices of consumer goods in Denmark had risen by 140 percent, and therefore the purchasing power of the people had dropped sharply.
    In the capitalist world, with the drastic reduction in civilian industry, the number of unemployed has also increased significantly. According to a report released by the U.S. Department of Labor, it is estimated that from February 1951 to February 1952, a total of 383,000 production workers were squeezed out of the manufacturing industry. Unemployment is particularly severe in important civilian industrial centers such as the textile industrial area of New England and the automobile industrial center of Detroit. For example, in Detroit, according to an estimate by "U.S. News & World Report" in mid-January, the number of unemployed had exceeded 120,000, accounting for more than 8 percent of the city's employment. Unofficial estimates in Britain put the number of unemployed at more than 600,000. The unemployment situation is most serious in the textile industry. According to Labor Party Member of Parliament Greenwood, speaking in the House of Commons on March 26th, there were 70,000 fully and partially unemployed cotton textile workers in the Lancashire region, the center of the textile industry, accounting for one-fifth to one-quarter of the total number of cotton textile workers. Former Labor Minister of the Labor Party government, Robens, predicted that if the current situation continues to develop, there will be one million unemployed in Britain by the end of this year. In Italy, the number of unemployed and partially unemployed people often reaches several million. Therefore, the arms expansion and war preparations of various capitalist countries mean unemployment, poverty, and misfortune for the people of those countries. This is why, when economic disaster looms, the people of all countries fervently hope for peace, for the development of civilian economy, and for the establishment of normal trade relations with all countries.

    美英等资本主义国家战争工业畸形发展的结果
    民用工业急遽减缩经济危机进一步发展
    【本报讯】以美国为首的侵略集团推行扩军备战的结果，已使整个资本主义世界经济危机进一步发展。
    首先，资本主义各国战争工业的畸形发展，已造成了民用工业的急剧减缩，工厂纷纷倒闭。据二月十五日出版的“美国新闻与世界报导”称：美国凡与生产军备有关的钢铁、飞机、机器（主要是武器和生产武器用的机器）、运输工具（主要是军用车辆，坦克之类）、石油等部门的生产都有很大增加，而另一方面，大多数民用生产都大量减少了。与一九五○年中期生产最高峰时相比，家庭用品减少了三分之一以上，毛织品减少了约三分之一，棉织品减少了五分之一以上，人造丝制品减少了将近三分之一，牛油减少约四分之一，鞋减少了四分之一以上，无线电和电视机减少了将近五分之三，民用房屋建筑方面，由于建筑器材优先拨给军用的结果，已较最高峰时减少了四分之一以上。英国的情形也是一样的。在军火工业优先制度的影响下，英国的一些非军事性的机器、电气和化学制造业的生产都大大减少。今年初，伦敦“金融时报”曾预告在重要工业中心的英国中部地区，一般机器制造业的生产量，将减少百分之三十到四十，一九五一年汽车产量已经比一九五○年减少百分之十，其他许多工业如服装、针织、羊毛、绒线、家具等业的生产也都普遍下降。据英国棉花管制委员会三月十四日宣布，全国已有四十三家纱厂倒闭，每周棉纱产量猛烈降低到一千六百五十七万磅，比去年同一周减少了五百十三万磅，将近总产量的四分之一。由于民用生产的急剧减缩，即使在军备生产扩张的情况下，资本主义国家的工业生产量依然是减低了。如美国的军备生产虽比去年增加了三倍，而美国工业总产量却比朝鲜战争前达到的最高峰降低了百分之二。据美国总统杜鲁门最近在国会的报告透露，包括英国在内的西欧军火生产在过去两年中已增加了三倍，但就在同时，英国工业的总生产量的增加率却明显地下降。而“英国经济学家”周刊的统计指出：一九五一年生产增加率比一九五○年减少将近百分之七十，到去年十二月，英国总生产量不仅停止增加，反而降低到去年一月的水平以下。这个事实严重地粉碎了那些以为大量扩充军备可以“繁荣”经济的资本家们的梦想。甚至美国“商业周刊”也不能不悲哀地承认：“扩充军备已不再足以支撑繁荣了。由于了解到这一点而产生的悲观情绪是无法隐讳的。”
    与军火生产的畸形发展同时，通货膨胀也正以愈来愈大的力量冲击着资本主义各国的经济基础。这种剧烈的通货膨胀造成了商品流通市场的巨大紊乱，使得物价上涨，消费品的销售是普遍降低。美国从一九五○年年初起到一九五一年十月，生活费用已上涨百分之二十。同时美国钢铁、石油、工具机等等所谓“国防生产”方面供不应求，另一方面民用物品滞销现象却非常严重。例如：衣服销售量较朝鲜战争后的最高峰减少了八分之一，汽车减少了约三分之一，整个零售业的售货量比最高峰时减少了百分之九点五。百货公司营业量较一九五一年初高峰减少了约百分之十二。在英国，去年生活费用也增加了百分之二十五，各种物品的消费量普遍降低。据英国官方统计：去年第三季比一九五○年同时期减少了百分之三。其中食物减少百分之点六，鞋减少百分之二十二点七，其他衣着减少百分之二○点五，家用物品减少百分之十四点六。西欧其他资本主义国家的情况，也都同样的严重。法国的物价普遍上涨，面粉价格就上涨了百分之四十八，面包价格上涨百分之三十八，植物油和糖的价格上涨百分之二十三。丹麦金融界的“金融新闻”登载彼得逊教授的一篇文章，指出从一九三九到一九五○年，丹麦消费物品的价格已上涨了百分之一百四十，因此人民的购买力已急剧降低。
    在资本主义世界，随着民用工业的剧烈缩减，失业人数也大量增加。据美国劳工部公布的报告估计，自一九五一年二月到一九五二年二月，共有三十八万三千生产工人被排挤出了制造工业。失业现象在重要的民用工业中心如新英格兰的纺织工业区和底特律汽车工业中心特别严重。例如，在底特律，据“美国新闻与世界报导”在一月中估计，失业人数已超过十二万人，占全市就业人数百分之八以上。英国非官方的估计，英国失业人数已达六十万人以上。纺织业失业现象最为严重。据工党议员格林伍德三月二十六日在下院宣称，在纺织业中心兰开夏地区，全失业和半失业的棉纺工人已有七万人，占棉纺工人总数的五分之一到四分之一。前工党政府劳工大臣罗本斯预测，如果目前的情况继续发展下去，到今年年底英国将有一百万人失业。在意大利失业和半失业的人经常达到好几百万。因此，各资本主义国家的扩军备战对于各国人民说来就意味着失业、贫穷和不幸。这就是为什么在经济大灾难临头的时候，各国人民热烈地希望和平，希望发展民用经济以及和一切国家建立正常的贸易关系的原因。
