(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th) Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, made detailed instructions on strengthening the leadership of economic work at the 24th Administrative Meeting of the Northeast People's Government held on April 7.

Gao Gang first pointed out that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the Northeast have achieved great victories. The "Three-Anti" movement will be basically completed in the Northeast level organs and provincial and municipal level organs in April. When the "Three-Anti" movement is nearing its end, it is necessary to prevent carelessness and relaxation, and prevent hasty conclusions. All loopholes in the work discovered in the "Three-Anti" movement must be thoroughly resolved by carefully formulating systems during the construction phase. The current central task is to carry out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to the end on the one hand, and to pay attention to strengthening the leadership of economic work on the other. He said that if we do not pay attention to strengthening the leadership of economic work, we will make mistakes. Due to the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a large number of activists have emerged, and the production enthusiasm of workers and other working people has been greatly improved. The people's democratic dictatorship has become more consolidated, the relationship between the government and the people has become closer, and our combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. Therefore, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a new upsurge of production will appear. Party organizations, people's governments, and mass organizations at all levels must organize the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants well, and quickly promote the arrival of a high tide of economic construction.

Next, Gao Gang gave instructions on the work of each department. Regarding state-owned industrial production, it is required to strive to complete 50% of the annual plan in the second quarter. The key to completing the plan lies in promoting advanced production experience and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all cadres and employees. During the construction phase of the "Three-Anti" movement, industrial departments must conduct a class education among workers in general, but the time should not be too long, and full preparations must be made in advance. The education should be carried out in response to the problems existing among workers, and the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie should be thoroughly clarified. It should be explained that in the new society and new country, stealing state property is shameful, and the working class should fight against all acts of stealing state property. In May, all employees should be mobilized to discuss the 1952 production plan, launch a broad and in-depth patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy, and reward model employees who actively produce, create wealth for the country, and are law-abiding.

The second quarter is a decisive season for capital construction. Gao Gang pointed out that capital construction is an extremely important task and a major issue related to the industrialization of our country, and it must be done well. Designs must be carefully reviewed and construction must be approved only after there is 100% certainty. Engineering companies must be effectively organized, and all state capital construction must not be contracted to private individuals; it has been fully proven from the "Five-Anti" movement that the private construction industry is full of "five poisons." The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, Party organizations at all levels in the Northeast, and governments at all levels must send people to the construction site in a timely manner to conduct thorough inspections (responsible comrades must personally inspect important projects). In April, it is especially necessary to thoroughly check the preparation of basic construction materials to prevent work stoppages due to lack of materials during construction. At the same time, the Industrial Department should organize safety inspections in the second quarter to effectively prevent fires and accidents and ensure the completion of production plans and capital construction.

Regarding state-owned trade work, Gao Gang said that in the second quarter, 42% to 43% of the annual plan must be completed. The tasks of purchasing grain and cotton must be completed. State-owned trade departments must closely integrate with cooperatives to quickly deliver spring plowing production materials to farmers. It is necessary to quickly restore processing orders and pay attention to supporting private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Legitimate businesses should be protected.

Gao Gang pointed out that spring plowing is the most central task that overwhelms everything in the countryside at present. Party committees, people's governments, and mass organizations at the provincial, county, district, and village levels must lead spring plowing with all their strength. It is necessary to quickly organize forces to go deep into the countryside for inspection, discover problems, and solve them at any time. Good experiences should be published in the newspapers at any time, and do not wait until after the event to do that lengthy spring plowing summary. In order to fully lead spring plowing, all counties that have carried out the "Three-Anti" movement, regardless of whether they have been completed or dealt with, should immediately stop temporarily. County-level cadres who have been found to have corruption problems in the "Three-Anti" movement but have not yet been dealt with may be ordered to perform meritorious service and redeem themselves in organizing spring plowing production, as long as they are not major corruption criminals with serious circumstances. County, district, and village cadres who have corruption, waste, and bureaucratic errors will be leniently dealt with or exempted from punishment as long as they actively work hard and make achievements in leading production. Those who are passive and lazy will be punished more severely. Gao Gang called on all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models, and rural cadres to actively play an exemplary role, unite the broad masses of peasants, and launch a vigorous and in-depth patriotic campaign to increase production between villages and villages, mutual aid groups and mutual aid groups, cooperatives and cooperatives, and farms and farms.

The first quarter of logging has completed and exceeded the task. Gao Gang pointed out that the timber transportation task must be completed in the second quarter without reduction to ensure national construction. At the same time, it is necessary to quickly and effectively launch tree planting and afforestation to ensure survival; in particular, it is necessary to seize the time to complete this year's West Manchurian shelterbelt afforestation task, and do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention.

The railway department must guarantee the completion of the loading plan, and all departments must guarantee the completion of their own loading tasks. Loading must be done quickly and well, and unloading must also be done quickly and well. All departments that do not load and unload on time in accordance with railway regulations will be fined. Similarly, if the railway delays the transportation of various departments, it should also be punished. The railway department must complete its own production plan, ensure the quality of work, and effectively improve the warehouse and financial systems. Public security personnel in the railway department must take effective measures to eliminate the use of railways for smuggling and drug trafficking. If public security personnel collude with drug traffickers, they will be severely punished.

Regarding financial and monetary work, Gao Gang pointed out that the Ministry of Finance should complete the task of turning over industrial profits and trade profits in the second quarter, and complete the tax collection task. Expenditures should be used for the most needed and most important economic construction, and consumer expenditures should be reduced or not spent as much as possible. Financial systems should be tightened, financial inspections should be strengthened, and corruption should be eliminated. In order to guarantee the needs of national economic construction, private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood can be given credit by banks with the approval of higher authorities after thorough examination. Banks should immediately distribute agricultural loans to farmers. The banking institutions are huge and must be thoroughly rectified in accordance with the spirit of the "Three-Anti" movement.

Gao Gang emphasized that in order to complete the above plan, everyone must conscientiously organize inspection work and oppose the style of formalism and bureaucracy that is high above, divorced from reality, and characterized by official document travel.

    在东北人民政府第二十四次行政会议上
    高岗同志指示加强经济工作领导
    发挥工人农民生产积极性，推动经济建设高潮的到来
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北人民政府主席高岗在四月七日召开的东北人民政府第二十四次行政会议上，对加强经济工作的领导作了详细的指示。
    高岗首先指出：东北的“三反”和“五反”运动，已经取得了极大的胜利。“三反”运动在东北一级机关和省市一级机关四月份将基本上完成。当“三反”运动临近结束的时候，必须防止马虎和松劲，防止草率收兵。在“三反”运动中所发现的工作中的一切漏洞，必须在建设阶段周密地拟定制度，彻底地解决。目前的中心工作，一方面要把“三反”和“五反”运动进行到底，一方面必须注意加强经济工作的领导。他说：再不注意加强经济工作的领导，就会犯错误。由于“三反”和“五反”运动的胜利，涌现出了大批积极分子，工人和其他劳动人民的生产积极性已大大提高，人民民主专政更加巩固，政府和人民的联系更加密切，我们的战斗力更加提高了，因此，在“三反”和“五反”运动之后，将会出现新的生产高潮。各级党的组织、人民政府和群众团体必须很好地组织工人和农民的生产积极性，迅速地推动经济建设高潮的到来。
    接着，高岗对每个部门的工作分别作了指示。关于国营工业生产，要求第二季度争取完成全年计划百分之五十。完成计划的关键在于推广先进生产经验，发挥全体干部和职工的积极性创造性。“三反”的建设阶段，工业部门要在工人中普遍地进行一次阶级教育，但时间不要太长，事先要做充分的准备，要针对工人中存在的问题来进行教育，彻底把工人阶级和资产阶级的界限划清。说明在新社会新国家中，盗窃国家资财是可耻的，工人阶级应当和一切盗窃国家资财的行为作斗争。在五月份，要发动全体职工讨论一九五二年的生产计划，展开一个广泛深入的爱国主义的增产节约运动，并奖励积极生产、给国家创造财富和奉公守法的模范职工。
    第二季度是基本建设有决定性的季节。高岗指出：基本建设是极端重要的任务，是关系我们国家工业化的一个重大问题，必须把它作好。要周密地审查设计，有百分之百的把握后才准施工。要切实把工程公司组织好，凡属国家基本建设，一概不准包给私人；从“五反”中已经充分证明私营建筑行业是“五毒”俱全的。东北人民政府工业部、东北各级党的组织和各级政府，必须及时地派人到施工现场切实地进行检查（重要工程，负责同志必须亲自检查）。在四月份，特别要切实检查基本建设材料的准备情况，防止施工中的停工待料现象。同时，工业部在第二季度应该组织保安检查，切实防止失火和事故，保证生产计划和基本建设的完成。
    关于国营贸易工作，高岗说：第二季度，必须完成全年度计划的百分之四十二到四十三。要完成购粮和购棉任务。国营贸易部门要和合作社密切结合，把春耕生产资料迅速地送到农民手里。要迅速恢复加工定货，注意扶持那些对国计民生有利的私营工业。对于正当的商业，要加以保护。
    高岗指出：春耕是目前农村中压倒一切的最中心任务，省、县、区、村的党委和人民政府、群众团体要以全力领导春耕，要迅速组织力量深入农村检查，发现问题，随时解决，要把好的经验随时在报上发表，不要等到事后去做那种冗长的春耕总结。为了全力领导春耕，所有进行了“三反”的县，不论结束或处理与否，都应一律立即暂时停止。县的机关干部在“三反”中已发现贪污问题尚未处理者，只要不是情节严重的大贪污犯，均可令其在组织春耕生产中立功赎罪。县、区、村干部中，有贪污、浪费、官僚主义错误的，只要他们在领导生产中积极努力，做出成绩，一律从宽处理或免予处分。对那些消极怠工的，则要加重处分。高岗号召一切共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范和农村干部要积极地起模范作用，团结广大农民，展开一个屯与屯、村与村、互助组与互助组、合作社与合作社、农场与农场之间的轰轰烈烈的广泛深入的爱国丰产竞赛运动。
    林木采伐第一季度已完成和超过了任务。高岗指出：第二季度必须完成木材运输任务，不得减少，以保证国家建设。同时要迅速地、切实地发动植树造林，保证成活；特别要抓紧完成今年的西满防护林带造林任务，并把护林防火工作作好。
    铁路部门必须保证完成装车计划，各个部门必须保证完成自己所提出的装车任务。装车要做到装的快装的好，还要卸的快卸的好。所有不按铁路规章按时装车卸车的部门要罚款，同样，铁路如果耽误了各个部门的运输，也应该受到处罚。铁路部门要完成自己的生产计划，保证工作质量，并要切实健全仓库和财务制度。铁路部门的公安人员必须采取有效措施，杜绝利用铁路走私贩毒，如果公安人员和毒贩勾结，要加重治罪。
    对财政金融工作，高岗指出，财政部要在第二季度完成工业利润和贸易利润的上缴任务，完成税收任务。要把开支用在最需要最重要的经济建设上，消费性的开支要尽量减少或不开支，要严密财务制度，加强财务检查，杜绝贪污。为了保证国家经济建设的需要，对有利于国计民生的私营工业，有困难者经过切实审查和上级批准，可由银行给以信贷。银行要把农贷立即发到农民手里。银行机构庞大，必须根据“三反”运动的精神，加以切实的整顿。
    高岗强调指出：为了完成上述计划，大家必须认真地组织检查工作，反对那种高高在上、脱离实际、公文旅行的文牍主义、官僚主义作风。
