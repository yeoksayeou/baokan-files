Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 6th: Under the direction of Ridgway Headquarters, the reactionary Yoshida government is continuously lifting the purge penalties and illegally restoring the civil and political rights of thousands of notorious militarists, especially war criminals who committed aggression against China, clearing the way for them to openly participate in the rearmament of Japan.

According to a list published by the Yoshida government on the 1st, another 1,194 Japanese war criminals have been de-purged, including important war criminal who committed aggression against China, Yasuji Okamura, former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, Kōtarō Nakamura, who served as commander of the China Garrison Army in 1932, and many former high-ranking generals of the Japanese Army and Navy. According to Kyodo News, as of now, the total number of those recently officially announced to be de-purged has reached 5,675.

In addition, the so-called "Public Office Qualification Appeal Review Board" in charge of de-purging affairs has made a "preliminary decision" on March 28 to de-purge approximately another 1,000 war criminals. Among them are also many important war criminals who committed aggression against China, such as: Teiichi Shimomura, former supreme commander of the North China Area of the China Expeditionary Army and Minister of the Army; Yoshisuke Aikawa, former president of "Manchuria Heavy Industries Development Corporation"; Tokuzō Komai, former director-general of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet "Manchukuo"; and Shoji Kanai, former supreme advisor to the "Mengjiang United Committee," and others.

Yasuji Okamura was not only a major butcher of the Chinese people of Japanese imperialism, but also helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang plan attacks against the Chinese people after Japan surrendered. In January 1949, under the instigation and protection of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang declared Yasuji Okamura "innocent" and sent him back to Japan. Yasuji Okamura's criminal act of raising "Japanese Volunteer Army" for the Chiang bandits after returning to Japan is now an open secret. Yasuji Okamura and Class A war criminals Shigemitsu Mamoru, Nishio Juzo, Kobayashi Seizo, Tani Hisao, Aoki Kazuo, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, etc., who were illegally de-purged not long ago, are all murderers whose hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people. The Chinese people express their anger at the illegal acts of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in shielding, releasing, and de-purging Japanese war criminals, and resolutely reserve the right to severely punish these war criminals, which cannot be erased.

    美日反动派竟非法将冈村宁次等解除整肃
    我国人民决保留严惩这些侵华战犯的权利
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：吉田反动政府在李奇微总部的指使下，不断地对成千的罪行昭著的军国主义分子，特别是侵华战犯解除整肃处分，非法恢复他们的公民权利和政治权利，为他们公开参加重新武装日本的工作扫清道路。
    根据吉田政府一日发表的名单，又有一千一百九十四名日本战犯被解除整肃，其中包括重要侵华战犯、前中国派遣军总司令冈村宁次，一九三二年曾任中国驻屯军司令的中村孝太郎以及前日本陆、海军高级将领多人。据共同社讯，截至现在为止，最近正式宣布解除整肃者总数已达五千六百七十五人。
    此外，主管解除整肃事宜的所谓“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”已在三月二十八日“初步决定”对另外约一千名战犯解除整肃。其中也有许多重要侵华战犯，如：前中国派遣军华北区最高指挥官、陆相下村定，前“满洲重工业会社”总裁鲇川义介，前伪“满洲国”总务厅长官驹井德三，前“蒙疆联合委员会”最高顾问金井章次等人。
    冈村宁次不仅是日本帝国主义屠杀中国人民的大刽子手，并且曾经在日本投降以后帮助蒋介石匪帮策划进攻中国人民。一九四九年一月，在美帝国主义的指使和包庇下，蒋介石匪帮宣布冈村宁次“无罪”，并把他送回日本。冈村宁次返日后为蒋匪募集“日本志愿军”的罪恶行为，现在已是公开的秘密了。冈村宁次和不久以前被非法解除整肃的甲级战犯重光葵、西尾寿造、小林跻造、谷正之、青木一男、长谷川清等等，都是双手沾满了中国人民的鲜血的凶手，中国人民对于美、日反动派对日本战犯的包庇、释放和解除整肃的非法行为，表示愤怒，并坚决保留不容抹煞的严厉惩办这些战争罪犯的权利。
