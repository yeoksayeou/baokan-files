    Welcome International Economic Conference Representatives to Visit China
    Nan Hanchen
    The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to the representatives from various countries attending the International Economic Conference who have come to China for a visit.
    The International Economic Conference has already achieved great and brilliant success. The conference brought together representatives from forty-nine countries, including industrialists, businessmen, trade union workers, economists, and cooperative workers with various political viewpoints. After extensive exchanges of opinions, they reached a consensus that the artificial barriers currently hindering the development of international trade have seriously damaged the economic development of many Western countries and will lead to a serious economic crisis; and that expanding trade relations between countries can enable the economic resources of all countries to be more fully utilized, increase employment, and improve people's living conditions. During the conference, representatives from various countries conducted various business negotiations and signed a large number of trade agreements, which became concrete and effective steps to promote the development of trade among countries. The conference decided to send a letter to the United Nations General Assembly, suggesting that an international trade conference be convened with the participation of governments and people from various countries, and to establish an International Trade Promotion Committee to specifically promote the implementation of the above-mentioned tasks. The Chinese people express their heartfelt support for the International Economic Conference, admire the efforts made by representatives from various countries to promote the development of international trade at the conference, and extend a warm welcome to their arrival in China.
    The visit to China by representatives from various countries attending the International Economic Conference is a successful development of the International Economic Conference, because the arrival of representatives in China is conducive to further expanding the influence of the International Economic Conference and promoting the implementation of the decisions made at the conference. China is an important international trading nation. The representatives who have come to China for a visit come from Europe, Asia, America, and Australia. Some of the representatives have already conducted business negotiations with the Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference in Moscow and signed trade agreements, while others have engaged in general contact. After arriving in China, representatives from various countries will have a deeper understanding of the possibilities for China to develop international trade. China's resources and products have always been known for their abundance. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government and its leadership of the people of the whole country in production and construction, industrial and agricultural production has rapidly increased, and new industrial and transportation construction is underway. Due to the implementation of land reform, economic development, and price stability in China, the people's purchasing power has been further rapidly increased, and the formation of China's unified, stable, and reliable market has created a complete possibility for the further development of China's foreign trade, and its future is very promising. China's consistent policy is to oppose blockade and embargo and to develop friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations between the people of all countries. Therefore, opportunities exist for industrialists and businessmen from various countries to further develop economic and trade relations with China. We are willing to enable representatives from various countries to have a more concrete understanding of the new China. This will greatly promote the development of friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations between the people of all countries and China.
    The International Economic Conference has been successful. The Chinese people fully support the International Economic Conference's proposals on eliminating artificial barriers and extensively developing international trade. We firmly believe that blockades and embargoes must be broken, international trade must be developed, employment opportunities for the people of all countries can be increased, and the living standards of the people of all countries can be improved. The trade agreements signed between China and various countries have a significant role in promoting the development of international trade. We are not only prepared to fully implement the trade agreements worth 223 million U.S. dollars that have already been signed at the conference, but also prepare to continue trade negotiations with industrialists and businessmen from various countries who are willing to sign trade agreements with China after the conference, in order to further expand China's trade relations with various countries. The Chinese people welcome all efforts to establish and expand friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations between the people of all countries. We welcome the representatives from various countries who have made many contributions to the International Economic Conference and who have come to China with the desire to establish and expand friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations with the Chinese people. We believe that this welcome is not just an ordinary polite gesture towards guests, but a manifestation of the joint efforts of China and the people of all countries to develop friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations.

    欢迎国际经济会议代表来到中国参观
    南汉宸
    中国人民对于参加国际经济会议的各国代表来到中国参观，表示热烈的欢迎。
    国际经济会议已经获得了伟大的辉煌的成就。会议集合了来自四十九个国家的具有各种不同政治见解的工商业家、工会工作者、经济学者、合作社工作者的代表，经过广泛地交换意见，得出一致的结论，认为目前阻碍国际贸易发展的人为障碍，已严重地损害了西方许多国家经济的发展，并将造成严重的经济危机；而各国之间扩大贸易关系，能使一切国家的经济资源得到更充分的利用，可以增加就业，改善人民生活条件。在会议中，各国代表进行了各种商务谈判，签订了大量的贸易协议，成为推动各国贸易向前发展的具体有效的步骤。会议决定致函联合国大会，建议召集各国政府与人民参加的国际贸易会议，同时成立国际贸易促进委员会，以具体推动上述各项工作的进行。中国人民对于国际经济会议表示衷心的拥护，对于各国代表在会议中为推动国际贸易发展而作的努力表示敬佩，对于他们的来到中国表示热烈的欢迎。
    国际经济会议各国代表来到中国参观，是国际经济会议成功的发展，因为各国代表来到中国，有利于进一步扩大国际经济会议的影响，促使会议中所作的决定付诸实施。中国是一个重要的国际贸易国家，来到中国参观的代表来自欧、亚、美、澳各洲，其中一部分代表已与中国出席国际经济会议的代表团在莫斯科进行商务谈判，并签订了贸易协议，另一部分代表则进行了一般的接触。各国代表来到中国以后，对于中国发展国际贸易的可能性必将有更深刻的了解。中国的资源与物产一向以丰富著称，自中央人民政府成立并领导全国人民进行生产建设以来，工业农业生产均已迅速增多，新的工业与交通建设已在进行之中。由于中国土地改革的实施，经济的发展，物价的稳定，进一步促使人民购买力的迅速提高，以及中国的统一的、稳定的、可靠的市场的形成，中国对外贸易进一步发展的可能性完全存在，而且其前途是很大的。中国的一贯政策是反对封锁与禁运，发展各国人民间的友好合作和经济贸易关系。因此，各国工商业家对中国进一步开展经济贸易关系的机会是存在的。我们愿意使各国代表有可能更加具体地理解新中国。这将大大促进各国人民对于中国的友好合作和经济贸易关系的发展。
    国际经济会议已经获得成功。中国人民完全拥护国际经济会议关于消除人为障碍、广泛发展国际贸易的建议。我们坚信封锁禁运必须打破、国际贸易必须发展，各国人民就业的机会才能增加，各国人民生活水准才能提高。中国与各国之间签订的贸易协议，对于国际贸易的发展有重大的推动作用。我们不仅准备圆满执行在会议中已经签订的数达二亿二千三百万美元的贸易协议，而且准备在会议以后继续与愿意与中国签订贸易协议的各国工商业家，进行贸易谈判，进一步扩大中国与各国的通商贸易关系。中国人民欢迎一切在各国人民之间建立与扩大友好合作和经济贸易关系的各种努力。我们对于参加国际经济会议作出许多贡献的，怀抱着与中国人民建立与扩大友好合作和经济贸易关系愿望而来到中国参观的各国代表，表示欢迎。我们认为这种欢迎不是一种普通的对于客人的例有的礼貌，而是中国与各国人民之间为发展友好合作和经济贸易关系而共同努力的表现。
