The 138th issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial commemorating World Youth Week, entitled "The Activities of Young Peace Fighters are Increasingly Strengthened." The editorial states: Hundreds of millions of democratic youth are an active and fighting force in the world peace movement. Among all the people of the world, young people are the first to directly and most severely suffer from the scourge of war. Young people in capitalist countries are resolutely opposed to all forms of militarization measures, against conscription and extended terms of service, and against participating in military blocs and sending troops to Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. After describing the difficult situation of young people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, and pointing out that they are being inspired by the beautiful prospects of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies, the editorial continues: The increasing organization of the youth movement and the increasing strengthening of youth unity guarantee that the youth's struggle for peace will be victorious. The World Federation of Democratic Youth is a major force in the world today, uniting more than 75 million young men and women in 84 countries. This year's World Youth Week was held in an atmosphere of great enthusiasm, with democratic and patriotic youth from all countries celebrating their festival under the slogan of expanding the struggle for peace and opposing the American conspiracies that attempt to dominate the world. Youth from all countries condemned the contemporary cannibals who spread plague and cholera, demanded an immediate end to bacteriological warfare, and severely punished the criminals who committed heinous crimes against the people of Korea, China, and all mankind. Young people all over the world also support the proposal to convene an international conference to defend youth rights in 1952. The editorial concludes by pointing out: Working youth are an inexhaustible reserve force for replenishing the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties. Therefore, providing constant guidance, assistance, and care to progressive youth organizations is a major task and responsibility of the Communist and Workers' Parties. However, when discussing the work carried out by the Communist Parties in France, Italy, Belgium, and other countries among young people, we find that many party organizations are still unconcerned about the lives and struggles of young people; the assistance to local youth organizations is insufficient; and there is little supervision and leadership over the work of Communist Party members in youth organizations. The Communist and Workers' Parties demand that all their organizations and every party member do more youth work—further consolidate the organizations of democratic youth and transform them into fighting, genuine mass organizations. A major task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to help the organizations of democratic youth cultivate a large number of activists, and to help these young activists grasp the theory of Marxism-Leninism, thereby introducing this theory to the masses of young people. Activists in revolutionary youth organizations, armed with the ever-victorious theory of Marxism-Leninism, will set aside any sectarian tendencies; in the struggle for peace, they will go deep into young men and women of various organizations without discrimination; they will expose all the deceptions of the imperialist lackeys, do their best to protect young people from the poisoning of fascists, right-wing socialists, and Tito elements, and at the same time give millions of young people more help so that they can embark on the road of active struggle against the sinister plans of the warmongers.

Other important articles in this issue include: "On the Results of the Indian General Election" by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India; "Friendship with the Soviet Union—the Foundation of the Strength and Development of People's Poland" by Mateusz, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "The Tito Fascist Gang Destroys National Education" by Lauren; and "'Workers' Affairs' Commemorates its 25th Anniversary" by Stoikov, Editor-in-Chief of the Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Affairs," and others.

Ghosh's article says: The Indian general election began in November 1951 and ended in most states by the end of January this year. Under very unfavorable conditions, the candidates of the Communist Party and the United Front won 37 seats in the National Assembly and 234 seats in the state legislatures. Communist leader Ravi Narayan Reddy received more than 300,000 votes in the Nalgonda National Assembly constituency, accounting for 78 percent of the total votes in the constituency. No candidate in India has received so many votes. These victories have greatly increased the prestige of the party and further consolidated the United Front. The broad masses trust us, and the people of the whole country hope that we will establish a united front and move towards victory. We must not fail this trust, and we must realize these expectations so that our people can obtain a happy and prosperous life.

Mateusz's article says: The friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples has become a solid foundation for our restoration of independence and consolidation of independence, and it has also become the foundation for our achievements in the economic, political, and ideological fields. The Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation, signed on April 21, 1945, is already being implemented, and its manifestation is the increasingly close economic and cultural relations between the two countries. Poland has obtained and continues to obtain assistance in raw materials, machinery, and loans from the Soviet Union. Mateusz's article also points out: The revived Poland is growing stronger because the Polish United Workers' Party is able to educate the working class with genuine patriotism, to educate them to be responsible for the fate of Poland, and to teach them to fully understand the principle that the working class is powerful by virtue of its close ties with the people, because the Polish United Workers' Party relies on the support of the masses, and because the working class and the laboring peasants have a strong alliance. People's Poland is becoming more and more powerful because reactionaries are gradually isolated, because we are constantly cleansing all alien and hostile elements from economic institutions, and because the policy of maintaining close alliance with the Soviet Union has been victorious, preventing the imperialists from carrying out armed intervention in Poland and other people's democracies, and preventing them from creating civil war in these countries.

This issue also publishes news of protests by the people of India, Britain, France, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and Australia against American imperialist bacteriological warfare under the column "American Imperialists Cannot Escape Punishment."

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主”中文版第一三八期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平、争取人民民主！”中文版第一三八期已经出版。
    本期发表纪念世界青年周的社论，题为“青年和平战士的活动日益加强。”社论说：亿万民主青年群众是世界和平运动中一支积极的、战斗的力量。在全世界人民当中，青年是首先直接地、最严重地蒙受战争的祸害的。资本主义国家青年都在坚决反对一切形式的军国主义化措置，反对征兵和延长服役年限，反对参加军事团体和派遣军队到朝鲜、越南和马来亚。社论在叙述了资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国家青年的困难处境，并指出他们正被苏联、中国、人民民主国家的美好远景所鼓舞之后，接着说：青年运动的越来越带有组织性，青年团结的日益加强，这些保证了青年们争取和平的斗争必将获得胜利，世界民主青年联盟是目前世界的一个重大力量，它团结了八十四个国家的七千五百万以上的男女青年。今年世界青年周是在伟大的热情洋溢的气氛中举行的，各国的民主青年们与爱国青年们在扩大争取和平的斗争、反对妄图称霸世界的美国的阴谋这个口号下，庆祝了自己的节日。各国青年们痛斥散播鼠疫和霍乱的当代的吃人生番们，要求立即制止细菌战，并严厉惩办对朝鲜、中国人民和全人类犯下滔天罪行的罪犯们。全世界青年并拥护在一九五二年召开国际保卫青年权利会议的建议。社论最后指出：劳动青年是补充共产党和工人党队伍的无穷无尽的后备部队，因此，给予进步的青年组织以经常的指导、帮助和关怀。也就是共产党和工人党重大的工作和责任。然而，在讨论到法国、意大利、比利时、以及其他国家的共产党在青年中所进行的工作的时候，我们发现有好些党组织对于青年们的生活和斗争，仍旧是不关心的；对于地方的青年组织的帮助，是不够的；对于共产党员在青年团体中的工作，很少监督和领导。共产党和工人党要求它们的一切组织和每个党员多做青年工作——进一步巩固民主青年的组织，使它们变成为战斗的、真正的群众组织。共产党和工人党的重大任务，就是要帮助民主青年的组织培养大量的积极分子，并且帮助这些青年积极分子掌握马克思—列宁主义的理论，从而把这种理论介绍到青年群众中去。革命的青年组织中的积极分子，他们把常胜的马克思—列宁主义的理论武装了自己，撇开了任何宗派主义的倾向；在争取和平的斗争中，他们将不分畛域地深入到各种组织的青年男女中去；他们将揭露帝国主义者的走狗们的一切欺骗，尽最大的努力来保卫青年们，使青年们不致受到法西斯、右翼社会党和铁托分子的毒害，同时给千百万青年人以更多的帮助，使他们能够走上为反对战争贩子的罪恶计划而作积极斗争的道路。
    本期其他重要的文章有：印度共产党总书记高士的“论印度大选的结果”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局候补委员马杜斯杰夫斯基的“与苏联的友谊——人民波兰的力量和发展的基础”，劳兰的“铁托法西斯匪帮摧残国民教育”，保加利亚“工人事业报”总编辑斯托依科夫的“‘工人事业报’创刊二十五周年纪念”等。
    高士的文章说：印度大选于一九五一年十一月开始，到今年一月底，大多数邦都告结束。共产党和统一阵线的候选人，在非常不利的条件下，在国会中赢得三十七席，在各邦议会中赢得二百三十四席。共产党领袖拉维·纳拉因·莱迪得到拿尔刚达国会议员选区三十万张以上的选票，占这个选区选票总数百分之七十八，印度的任何候选人都没有得到这样多的选票。这些胜利已使党的威信大大增加，使统一阵线更加巩固。广大的群众信赖我们，全国人民都希望我们建立统一阵线并走向胜利，我们必须不辜负这种信托，必须实现这些期望，使我国人民获得幸福和繁荣的生活。
    马杜斯杰夫斯基的文章说：波兰人民和苏联人民间的友谊，已成了我们恢复独立和巩固独立的坚实基础，也成了我们在经济、政治和思想方面取得成就的基础。一九四五年四月二十一日签订的苏波友好互助与战后合作条约已经在实现，其表现就是两国的经济关系和文化关系日趋密切，波兰自苏联获得了而且现在继续获得原料、机器和贷款的援助。马杜斯杰夫斯基的文章并指出：复兴后的波兰是成长壮大了，因为波兰统一工人党能够以真正的爱国主义教育工人阶级，教育他们对波兰的命运负责，教他们充分了解到工人阶级靠着和人民的密切联系而强大有力的道理，因为波兰统一工人党倚靠人民大众的支持，因为工人阶级和劳动农民有着强固的联盟。人民的波兰愈来愈强大，这是因为反动分子逐渐孤立，因为我们不断地从经济机构中清冼出一切异己的敌对分子，因为和苏联保持密切联盟的政策取得了胜利，阻止了帝国主义者对波兰和其他人民民主国家进行武装干涉，阻止了他们在这些国家制造内战。
    本期并在“美帝国主义者逃不了惩罚”一栏下，刊载了印度、英国、法国、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、澳大利亚人民抗议美帝国主义细菌战的消息。    （新华社）
