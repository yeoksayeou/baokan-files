　　Economic Briefs
　　▲ Li Chenggui, Tian Qifa, Zhu Hongxiu, Lin Zigui, Liao Renfu, and other eleven model farmers from Hunan Province who were awarded the "National Model of Patriotic Production" certificate, medal, and bonus by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1951, along with the mutual aid teams they lead, have successfully completed spring plowing preparations and are now engaged in intensive spring plowing production, determined to strive for an even better harvest this year. Since last winter, these mutual aid teams have been discussing and formulating patriotic production plans to guarantee an average yield of over 1,000 jin of rice per mu this year, and have accumulated more fertilizer than in previous years.
　　▲ This spring, Longtan Township in Jiahe County, Hunan Province, established a Cattle Protection Committee. Under the leadership of the Cattle Protection Committee members, farmers know that "to increase production patriotically, we must protect our cattle." In February, they held a cattle health competition. Farmers from the entire township brought their cattle together to compare their robustness, check for lice and mange, and inspect whether the cattle pens were dry, clean, and warm. Then, everyone on the spot evaluated and ranked them, praising the good ones and criticizing the bad ones. As a result of the competition, out of the 210 cattle in the township, 50 that were well-fed received awards, and more than 20 that were poorly fed were criticized.
　　▲ Since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain in various parts of Southern Jiangsu for more than a month, and many low-lying wheat fields have been flooded. According to statistics from Liyang, Yixing, Lishui, Jintan, and Jiangning counties, more than 190,000 mu of wheat fields have been flooded, and thousands of mu of wheat fields in other counties have also been flooded, with most wheat seedlings beginning to turn yellow. In order to prevent wheat production from being reduced due to flooding this year, Party and government leading cadres in Jiangning, Danyang, Liyang, Fengxian and other counties have led a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in rescuing wheat fields. The county head of Jintan County and the Jintan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally led four work groups, bringing five water bailers to the countryside overnight, and have now helped farmers rescue many flooded wheat fields. Under the leadership of cadres and labor models, farmers in various places have boosted their confidence and have organized themselves to do their best to drain water.

    ▲荣获中央人民政府农业部一九五一年“爱国丰产模范”奖状、奖章、奖金的湖南省十一位丰产模范李承桂、田启发、朱鸿修、林子桂、廖仁福等，和他们领导的互助组，已胜利地完成了春耕准备工作，正投入紧张的春耕生产，决心争取今年更好的丰收。去冬以来，这些互助组就经过酝酿，订立了保证今年平均每亩产水稻一千斤以上的爱国丰产计划，都积了比往年更多的肥料。
    ▲今春，湖南嘉禾县龙潭乡成立了一个护牛委员会，在护牛委员们的领导下，农民们都知道“要爱国增产，一定要保护耕牛”。二月中，他们举行了一次耕牛的健康比赛。全乡农民把耕牛牵在一起，比较壮瘦，检查牛身上有没有虱子和毛?，检查牛栏是否干燥、清洁、暖和，然后，当场由大家评等级，表扬好的，批评坏的。比赛结果，全乡二百一十头耕牛，喂得健壮得到奖励的有五十头，喂得不好受到批评的二十多头。
    ▲入春以来，苏南各地连续阴雨已一个多月，不少低洼麦田被水淹没。溧阳、宜兴、溧水、金坛、江宁五县统计：被淹麦田已有十九万多亩，其他各县也都有数千亩麦田被淹，麦苗大多开始发黄。为了争取今年小麦不致因涝减产，江宁、丹阳、溧阳、奉贤等县的党、政领导干部都带了大批干部下乡，领导农民抢救麦田。金坛县县长和该县中共县委等亲自率领了四个工作组，随带了五部戽水机星夜下乡，现已帮助农民救出了很多被淹麦田。各地农民在干部和劳动模范的带头下，信心提高，纷纷组织起来全力排水。
