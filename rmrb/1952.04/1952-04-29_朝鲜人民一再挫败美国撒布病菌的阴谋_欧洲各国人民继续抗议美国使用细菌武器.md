Xinhua News Agency, April 26th dispatch: TASS, Pyongyang, April 24th: Residents in various parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continue to fight against the bacteriological weapons used by the American interventionists.

However, the enemy's despicable conspiracy has been thwarted everywhere by the selfless work of the epidemic prevention teams. In the province, twenty mobile epidemic prevention teams are working under the command of the epidemic prevention committee, and five epidemic prevention teams are working in the major cities. With the active support of the local residents, these epidemic prevention teams have carried out large-scale work to eliminate the dropped insects.

Residents have been vaccinated. Reservoirs have been disinfected, and infectious rodents have been exterminated.

Thanks to the vigilance of the epidemic prevention teams and the residents, the germ-carrying insects dropped by the Americans have been eliminated. Residents have been vaccinated.
