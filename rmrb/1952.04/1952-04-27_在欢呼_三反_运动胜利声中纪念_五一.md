    Commemorating "May Day" Amidst Cheers of Victory for the "Three-Anti" Campaign

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, unfolded nationwide, has achieved a great victory. This great struggle has not only cleansed the filth and poison left over from the old society but also transformed and is transforming the old thinking of intellectuals. I am an intellectual and a technician, and having lived in the old society for decades, I undoubtedly possess bourgeois ideas. However, I used to think that I had not participated in any reactionary party or organization, so I felt very "pure" and failed to deeply examine and reflect on my old thinking. I had serious purely technical viewpoints. I mistakenly thought that the reason I was "retained" was simply because I had technical skills. Therefore, I thought it would be enough to put more effort into the technical aspects. I paid less attention to political or policy issues, relying on the veteran cadres to solve them. This purely technical viewpoint, divorced from politics, has consistently hindered my progress. When handling business matters, I lacked a comprehensive perspective, relying solely on one-sided materials, disregarding objective reality, not following the specific laws of objective development, not relying on the masses, and not humbly listening to the opinions of others, presumptuously relying on my narrow experience to handle problems. This great "Three-Anti" campaign, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, awakened me, educated me, and allowed me to further transform my thinking. It made me realize that technology must and inevitably serve politics, that technology must be subject to political leadership, that technicians must have a clear class stance, draw clear lines, and use the thinking of the working class as the guiding ideology in their work, serving the people wholeheartedly.
    The source of funds for the industrialization of our people's country must be sought from increasing production and practicing economy. This is the only correct path, beyond doubt. This "Three-Anti" campaign repelled the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements against the working class, clearing obstacles for increasing production and practicing economy. In our railway construction, we used to blindly rely on private contractors, causing great losses to the country. In this campaign, we fully recognized the seriousness of the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements against the people's railways, and we also realized more clearly that to do a good job in railway construction, we must establish our own construction force. Through this campaign, we must further establish an economic accounting system, realize enterprise management in construction, and accumulate more wealth for the country. "May Day" International Labor Day is the fighting festival for the working class around the world to review their strength, a festival symbolizing the unity, struggle, and victory of the working class. Under the leadership of its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, and the wise Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class, allied with the broad masses of peasants and the people of the whole country, has already achieved great victories. Today, commemorating "May Day" at a time when the "Three-Anti" campaign has achieved a great victory fills me with confidence. The "Three-Anti" campaign has educated me and has also given me unlimited strength. In the upcoming great movement to increase production and practice economy, I must be with my comrades, build the people's railways better, strengthen the national defense and economic strength of the motherland, strengthen the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement, and respond to the shameless bacteriological warfare of American imperialism with practical actions, and defend world peace.

    在欢呼“三反”运动胜利声中纪念“五一”

    在全国范围内展开的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经大获全胜。这个伟大的斗争，不但清洗了旧社会遗留下来的污毒，而且改造了和改造着知识分子的旧思想。我是个知识分子，又是个技术人员，在旧社会生活了几十年，无疑问地有着资产阶级思想。可是我过去以为自己没有参加过反动党团，觉得很“清高”，对于自己的旧思想没有能深刻地检查和反省。我有严重的单纯技术观点。我错误地认为我所以被“留用”，无非是因为我有技术。因此，我想只是在技术方面多出些力就好了。对于政治性或政策性的问题，则少加过问，依赖老干部去解决。这种脱离政治的单纯技术观点一直阻碍着我的前进。处理业务工作时，我没有全面观点，仅仅根据片面的材料，不管客观实际情况，不依据客观事物发展的具体规律，不依靠群众，不虚心听取别人的意见，自以为是地靠自己的狭隘的经验来处理问题。这次伟大的“三反”运动，犹如晴天霹雳，惊醒了我，教育了我，使我得到了进一步的思想改造，使我认识到技术必然也必须为政治服务，技术必须服从政治领导，技术人员必须有明确的阶级立场，划清界限，以工人阶级的思想为工作中的指导思想，全心全意为人民服务。
    我们人民国家工业化资金的来源，必须从增产节约中去寻求。这是不可怀疑的唯一正确的道路。这次“三反”运动打退了资产阶级不法分子向工人阶级的猖狂进攻，为增产节约扫清了障碍。在我们的铁路工程建设中，曾经盲目地依靠私营包商，给国家造成了很大的损失。在这次运动中，我们充分地认清了资产阶级不法分子向人民铁路猖狂进攻的严重性，我们也更认清了要搞好铁路工程建设，就必须建立起我们自己的施工力量。通过这次运动，我们要更进一步地建立经济核算制度，在施工中实现企业化，为国家积累更多的财富。“五一”国际劳动节是全世界工人阶级检阅自己力量的战斗节日，是象征工人阶级团结、斗争、胜利的节日。中国工人阶级在它的先锋队中国共产党和英明的毛主席领导下，和广大农民结成联盟，和全国人民一道，已经获得了伟大的胜利。今天在“三反”运动得到伟大胜利的时候来纪念“五一”，使我充满了信心。“三反”运动教育了我，也给了我无限的力量。在即将来到的伟大的增产节约运动中，我一定要和同志们在一起，把人民铁路建设得更好，加强祖国的国防力量和经济力量，加强抗美援朝运动，以实际行动来答复美帝国主义的无耻的细菌战，捍卫世界和平。
