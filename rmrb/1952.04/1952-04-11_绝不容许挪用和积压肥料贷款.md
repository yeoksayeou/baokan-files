    Absolutely No Embezzlement or Retention of Fertilizer Loans Allowed

    In some areas, cooperatives have been found to embezzle and retain fertilizer loans at will. Some cooperatives have used fertilizer loans to operate other businesses; some cooperatives have shelved fertilizer loans; some cooperatives have used part of this year's fertilizer loans to repay last year's fertilizer loans owed to the bank. Before mid-March, cooperatives in Hebei Province had embezzled and retained 38 billion yuan of fertilizer loans in this way, cooperatives in Pingyuan Province had embezzled and retained 15 billion yuan of fertilizer loans, and cooperatives in Chahar Province had embezzled and retained 4 billion yuan of fertilizer loans. Similar phenomena have occurred in cooperatives in other regions as well. Although many cooperatives have recognized that this is wrong and are changing this situation, this serious problem still requires the high attention of cooperative workers in various places.

    The supply of fertilizer by cooperatives is a very important task. It can promote increased agricultural production, facilitate the state's purchase of agricultural products, and combine the state's economic plan with farmers' production plans. Therefore, this year's plan for cooperatives in various places to supply fertilizer to farmers must be 100% fulfilled, and not allowed to fall short. May we ask: How can the realization of the fertilizer supply plan be guaranteed if fertilizer loans are embezzled and retained at will? From a national perspective, the quantity of fertilizer supplied by cooperatives is very large, and the funds for supplying fertilizer are already insufficient; this requires ensuring that all state fertilizer loans are used for fertilizer supply business, and that all possible means are used to accelerate capital turnover, and to first absorb part of the funds through the "deposit in kind and advance sale" method, in order to smoothly complete this year's fertilizer supply task. Any phenomenon of embezzling and retaining fertilizer loans must be immediately corrected!

### 绝不容许挪用和积压肥料贷款

    绝不容许挪用和积压肥料贷款
    有些地区的合作社，发生了随便挪用和积压肥料贷款的现象。有些合作社把肥料贷款拿来经营了其他业务；有些合作社把肥料贷款搁置起来；有些合作社则挪用今年的肥料贷款的一部分，归还了去年欠银行的肥料贷款。在三月中旬以前，河北省的合作社就这样挪用和积压了肥料贷款三百八十亿元，平原省的合作社挪用和积压了肥料贷款一百五十亿元，察哈尔省的合作社挪用和积压了肥料贷款四十亿元。其他地区的合作社，也曾发生类似的现象。虽然不少合作社已经认识了这样做是错误的，并且已在改变这种情况，但是，这个严重的问题，仍须引起各地合作社工作人员的高度注意。
    合作社供应肥料，是一个十分重要的工作。它可以促进农业增产、便于国家收购农产品、使国家的经济计划和农民的生产计划结合起来。因此，今年各地合作社供应农民肥料的计划，只许百分之百的实现，不许落空。试问：随便挪用、积压肥料贷款，怎么能够保证供应肥料计划的实现呢？从全国范围来说，合作社供应肥料的数量很大，供应肥料资金已经不敷应用；这就必须保证把国家的肥料贷款全部用于供应肥料业务，而且要想尽一切办法，加速资金周转，并通过“存实预售”的办法，先吸收一部分资金，才能顺利完成今年的供应肥料任务。任何挪用、积压肥料贷款的现象都必须立即予以纠正！
