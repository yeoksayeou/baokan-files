    Treat Film Screenings Seriously and Prudently

    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Supervision Commission of the East China Military and Political Committee promptly corrected the error made by the East China Military and Political Committee's Tax Bureau in Shanghai regarding the screening of the film "Innocent Guilty," and disciplined Zhao Qingxin, the deputy director of the bureau. This measure is entirely correct.

    "Innocent Guilty" is a famous play by the great Russian playwright Alexander Ostrovsky. The Moscow Film Studio successfully adapted this work for the screen and it won the Stalin Prize. This film powerfully exposes the ugly and decadent features of the old Russian aristocracy and bourgeoisie, and depicts the noble image of the Russian people, who suffered damage and insult, in their pursuit of truth and justice. However, the East China Military and Political Committee's Tax Bureau disregarded the positive political significance of the Soviet film "Innocent Guilty" and treated it as a negative film, refusing to reduce taxes. What an absurd action!

    This error shows that the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation's East China District Company, the East China Military and Political Committee's Tax Bureau, and other relevant units lacked political enthusiasm and a high degree of principle in dealing with the screening of this important film. They did not fully and correctly seize the opportunity of the film's release to responsibly point out to the masses: that this outstanding film allows us to compare China's illegal capitalists with the old Russian aristocrats and bourgeoisie, helping us to more clearly recognize the ugly thoughts and behaviors of China's illegal capitalists. On the contrary, an organization like the East China Military and Political Committee's Tax Bureau took an unserious attitude towards this film, sending only the deputy section chief of the local tax department and a few newly employed comrades to review it. The bureau's leadership also failed to seriously understand the specific content of the film or proactively contact the Culture Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, and mistakenly and unilaterally believed that the film was not directly related to the current political tasks, thus proposing not to reduce taxes.

    This error also demonstrates that the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation's East China District Company failed to adhere to the truth and severely lacked discipline. Although it had repeatedly requested the relevant local departments to reduce taxes on the film, it did not consult the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation in Beijing or the Central Film Bureau on this matter, and lightly released the film locally, which in effect echoed the erroneous opinion. The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation and its affiliated departments should draw sufficient lessons from this incident and improve their work.

    The aforementioned error also demonstrates that the Party's leadership of local literary and artistic work is not strong enough. In a city like Shanghai, where communication is extremely convenient, such an error could occur, prompting people to ask: "When the opinions of the distribution company, the Film Department of the Culture Department, and the Tax Bureau differ, where is the Party organization's leadership in literary and artistic work?" In the leadership of film work, the Party organization should be keenly aware of all non-proletarian thoughts and emotions, observe every major task in film distribution from the height of principle, and oppose anyone who treats literary and artistic works of any era with an anti-Marxist attitude, as happened this time with Ostrovsky's work. The Party's leadership in literary and artistic work should not only kindly nurture and carefully cultivate film creation, but also be extremely concerned about understanding and checking film distribution work, and should especially personally arrange the screening of important films through relevant administrative units and mass organizations for film criticism.

    严肃慎重地对待影片上演问题
    中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会和华东军政委员会人民监察委员会，及时纠正了对待“无罪的人”影片在上海上演时华东军政委员会税务管理局方面所发生的错误，给了该局副局长赵清心以处分。这一措施是完全正确的。
    “无罪的人”是俄罗斯伟大剧作家奥斯特洛夫斯基的名剧。莫斯科电影制片厂将这一作品异常成功地搬上银幕，曾获得斯大林奖金。这部电影有力地揭露了旧俄贵族和资产阶级丑恶腐朽的面貌，描绘了备受损害和侮辱的俄罗斯人民追求真理和正义的崇高形象。而华东军政委员会税务管理局却无视苏联影片“无罪的人”的积极政治意义，竟将它当成消极影片来看待。不予减税。这是何等荒谬的行为！
    这一错误表现出：中国影片经理公司华东区公司、华东军政委员会税务管理局及其他有关单位，对待这一部重要的影片上演的问题，缺少政治的热情和高度的原则性。他们没有充分正确地利用这部影片上演的时机，向人民群众负责地指出：正是这部杰出的影片，使我们能够把中国的违法资本家和旧俄贵族、资产阶级对照起来，帮助我们更加清楚地认识中国违法资本家的丑恶的思想行为。相反，如华东军政委员会税务管理局这样的机关，对待这部影片竟采取了不严肃的态度，仅派了地方税科副科长和几个新参加工作的同志去审查；该局的领导人员又没有认真地去了解影片的具体内容，也没有主动地和华东军政委员会文化部取得联系，就错误地片面地认为该片和当前政治任务没有直接关联，因而提出不予减税的意见。
    这一错误又表现出：中国影片经理公司华东区公司不能够坚持真理，严重地缺乏纪律性。它虽曾不断向当地有关部门提出要求对该片减税的意见，但却没有将此事向北京中国影片经理总公司或中央电影局请示，就在当地轻率地将该片上演，这就在实际行动上附和了错误的意见。中国影片经理总公司及其所属各部门，应从这一事件中得出足够的经验教训，改进自己的工作。
    上述的错误也表现出：当地文艺工作的党的领导不够坚强。在上海那样通讯联络极为便利的城市，竟能发生那样的错误，人们不禁就会问道：“当经理公司、文化部电影处和税务管理局的意见各不相同的时候，党组织在文艺工作上的领导作用到那里去了？”在电影工作的领导上，党组织应该是灵敏地察辨一切非无产阶级的思想情绪，把影片发行上的每一重大工作都提到原则的高度上来观察，反对任何人用反马克思主义的态度来对待任何时期的文学艺术作品，如像这次对待奥斯特洛夫斯基的作品这样。党在文艺工作上的领导，不仅应该亲切地抚育和仔细地培养电影创作，而且还需要极为关怀地去了解和检查影片的发行工作，尤其应该经过有关行政单位和电影批评的群众组织，去亲手安排那些重要影片的上演工作。
