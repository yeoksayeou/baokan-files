Actively Respond to the Patriotic Production Increase Campaign
Zha Hayang and Over Twenty State-Owned Farms Accept the Challenge
Guaranteeing Increased Unit Yields on Large Areas and Helping Local Farmers Improve Farming Techniques

State-owned farms across the country are actively responding to the patriotic production increase campaign initiated by the Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School Practice Farm and eleven other state-owned farms and one People's Liberation Army farm directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Currently, the following farms have issued letters of acceptance to participate in the competition: Zha Hayang Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province, Keshan County Agricultural Experiment Station, Tongbei County Demonstration Farm, Boai Mechanized Farming Farm in Pingyuan Province, Yushu County Demonstration Farm in Jilin Province, Xiong Yue Agricultural Experiment Station and Xi'an County Farm in Liaodong Province, Farms in Jinghai, Fuping, and Anguo Counties in Hebei Province, Agricultural Experiment Station and Hejin County Farm in Shanxi Province, Yanshan County Farm in Shandong Province, Anyang Cotton Farm and Puyang, Wuzhi, and Shenxian County Farms in Pingyuan Province, Xianghu Farm, Quzhou Special Zone Farm, and Ningbo Special Zone Farm in Zhejiang Province, Gaoyou Rice Farm, Lianshui County Farm, and Nantong County Sanyu District Farm in Northern Jiangsu, Ningxiang Farm, Xupu Farm, and Lixian County Cotton Farm in Hunan Province, and others. These farms have also listed their conditions for accepting the challenge, issuing challenges to compete with state-owned farms, mutual aid teams, and farmers within their respective provinces and regions.

Each state-owned farm has put forward its conditions for accepting the challenge based on its specific circumstances in its letter of acceptance. For example, the conditions for Zha Hayang Mechanical Farm's acceptance are: the yield of 3,420 hectares (each hectare is equivalent to 15 mu, totaling 51,300 mu) of paddy rice must reach 5,560 jin per hectare, which is 39 percent higher than the average farmland in the area and 11.2 percent higher than last year's planned yield. Among them, the yield of the 200-hectare demonstration mechanized farming area will strive to reach 10,000 jin per hectare; the yield of the two-hectare high-yield experimental plot will strive to reach 15,000 jin per hectare. In addition, the average yield of 555 hectares of wheat will reach 2,280 jin per hectare, exceeding the yield of general cultivated land in the area by 46 percent; the average yield of 631 hectares of soybeans will reach 2,942 jin per hectare, exceeding the yield of local farmland by 28 percent. In addition, 80 hectares of soybeans and wheat will be specially cultivated, striving for an average yield of 5,000 jin per hectare. The Yanshan County Farm in Shandong Province requires that the total output this year increase by 92 percent compared to last year, and the yield of various crops be 20 percent higher than the local average yield. Boai Mechanized Farming Farm and other five farms in Pingyuan Province have all guaranteed that the yield of each crop will increase by 30 percent compared to the average yield per mu last year; each farm will also create one or more high yields per unit area. All state-owned farms in Zhejiang that have accepted the challenge have guaranteed that the average annual yield will increase by more than 30 percent compared to last year. The two challenging farms in Liaodong Province have guaranteed that the average yield per mu of various grain crops in the entire farm will reach more than 580 jin to 900 jin, with at least 60 jin more per mu than last year, and 30 percent higher than the average yield of local farmers; and each will set up seven mu of high-yield land to create high yields of 1,400 jin per mu of sorghum and 1,100 jin per mu of millet.

In order to ensure the completion of the production increase plan, the above-mentioned farms that have accepted the challenge have guaranteed to use excellent varieties, deeply cultivate and meticulously cultivate, apply more fertilizer, pay attention to preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and prepare for drought prevention and drought resistance. Some challenging mechanized farms have also proposed plans to reduce production costs based on their specific conditions. For example, Zha Hayang Farm guarantees to strictly implement the technical maintenance system for various machines, reduce accidents, and further improve the efficiency of agricultural machinery. The goal is for one "Stalin 80" to complete 2,000 hectares of work throughout the year, an increase of 81.8 percent compared to last year, and the fuel consumption per hectare cultivated by each tractor will not exceed 19 jin (compared to 20 jin and 4 liang last year).

In addition, many of the above-mentioned state-owned farms have proposed to do a good job in demonstration work and help local farmers organize to increase the yield per unit area. For example, the specific plans of Zha Hayang Farm are: 1. Do a good job in demonstrating a joint production team, using various agricultural production technologies as much as possible to improve the effect of collective production, and set an example for farmers' collective production. 2. Support an agricultural production cooperative, providing material assistance and technical guidance (plowing 30 hectares, providing 9,000 jin of high-quality rice seeds, and guiding them in rational fertilization, irrigation, and other cultivation techniques), guaranteeing that the average yield per hectare of this cooperative will be more than 8,000 jin. Yushu County Demonstration Farm in Jilin Province proposed: this year, four technical teams will be focused on cultivation in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups near the farm, and technicians will be specially dispatched to go deep into villages and villages to provide on-site guidance; and it is planned to hold regular operational performances of complex new-style farm implements, invite farmers to visit, and help them master the operational technology of new-style farm implements. Yanshan Farm in Shandong Province proposed that it is necessary to effectively lead the county's labor models, production activists, and 132 demonstration households, 40 promotion committee members, and 312 agricultural technology groups to improve farming techniques and help them increase the yield per unit area.

    积极响应爱国增产竞赛
    查哈阳等二十多个国营农场应战
    保证在大面积上提高单位产量，并帮助当地农民改进耕作技术
    全国各地国营农场，纷纷响应中央人民政府农业部直属双桥机耕学校实习农场等十一个国营农场和一个解放军农场发起的爱国增产竞赛。目前发出应战书参加竞赛的已有：黑龙江省查哈阳机械农场、克山县农业试验场、通北县示范农场，平原省博爱机耕农场，吉林省榆树县示范农场，辽东省熊岳农业试验场、西安县农场，河北省静海、阜平、安国三个县农场，山西省农业试验场、河津县农场，山东省盐山县农场，平原省安阳棉场和濮阳、武陟、莘县三个县农场，浙江省湘湖农场、衢州专区农场和宁波专区农场，苏北区高邮稻作场、涟水县农场和南通县三余区农场，湖南省宁乡农场、溆浦农场和澧县棉场等。这些农场并列出自己的应战条件，分别向本省区内的国营农场、互助组和农民发出挑战竞赛。
    各国营农场在应战书中都根据自己的具体情况，提出了应战条件。如查哈阳机械农场的应战条件是：三千四百二十垧（每垧合十五市亩，共五万一千三百亩）的水稻，每垧产量要达到五千五百六十斤，比当地一般农田高百分之三十九，比去年的计划产量高百分之十一点二。其中二百垧的示范机耕区，争取每垧产量达到一万斤；两垧高产量试验田，争取每垧产量达到一万五千斤。另外五百五十五垧小麦每垧平均产量达到二千二百八十斤，超过当地一般耕地产量百分之四十六；六百三十一垧大豆，平均每垧产量达到二千九百四十二斤，超过当地农田产量百分之二十八。并特别培植八十垧大豆和小麦，争取平均每垧产量达到五千斤。山东盐山县农场要求今年总产量比去年增加百分之九十二，各种农作物的产量比当地的平均产量高出百分之二十。平原省博爱机耕农场等五个农场，都保证每种农作物产量比去年每亩的平均产量增产百分之三十；每个农场并创造一种以上单位面积高额产量。浙江各应战国营农场都保证全年平均产量比去年增产三成以上。辽东省两个应战农场都保证全场各种粮食作物每亩平均产量要达到五百八十斤以上到九百斤，每亩要比去年至少增产六十斤以上，比当地农民的平均产量高三成以上；并各设丰产地七亩，创造高粱每亩一千四百斤、谷子每亩一千一百斤的高额产量。
    为了保证完成增产计划，上述各应战农场都保证做到选用优良品种，深耕细作，多施肥料，注意防除病虫害，做好防旱抗旱准备工作。一些应战机械农场并根据本身具体情况，提出降低生产成本的计划。如查哈阳农场保证要严格执行各种机械的技术保养制度，减少事故，进一步提高农耕机械的效能。要做到一台“斯大林八十号”全年的工作量达到二千垧，比去年增加百分之八十一点八，每台拖拉机每耕一垧地的耗油量最多不超过十九斤（去年是二十斤零四两）。
    此外，上述许多国营农场都提出要做好示范工作，帮助当地农民组织起来提高单位面积产量。如查哈阳农场的具体计划是：一、作好一个示范合营生产队的工作，在可能范围内运用各种农业生产技术，提高集体生产效果，为农民的集体生产做出样子。二、扶助一个农业生产合作社，给以物资帮助和技术指导（代耙地三十垧，给优良水稻种子九千斤，指导他们进行合理施肥、灌溉及其他栽培技术），保证这个合作社每垧平均产量在八千斤以上。吉林榆树县示范农场提出：今年要在农场附近的农业生产合作社和互助组中重点培养四个技术小组，专门派遣技工深入村、屯实地指导；并计划定期举行复杂的新式农具的操作表演，邀请农民参观，帮助他们掌握新式农具的操作技术。山东盐山农场提出，要切实领导全县的劳动模范、生产积极分子和一百三十二个示范户，四十名推广委员和三百十二个农业技术组改进耕作技术，帮助他们提高单位面积产量。
