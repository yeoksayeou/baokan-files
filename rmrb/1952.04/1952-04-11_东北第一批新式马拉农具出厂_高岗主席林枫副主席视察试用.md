The first batch of domestically produced new-style animal-drawn farm implements in Northeast China has rolled off the production line. Chairman Gao Gang and Vice-Chairman Lin Feng inspect and test them.

On March 29th, Chairman Gao Gang and Vice-Chairman Lin Feng of the Northeast People's Government personally inspected and tested the first batch of domestically produced new-style animal-drawn farm implements (among which the seeder is the first domestically produced one). Chairman Gao Gang and Vice-Chairman Lin Feng inquired in detail about the performance and cost of the farm implements, and personally held the plow to till the land and sat on the disc harrow to harrow the land.

According to Chairman Gao Gang's instructions – new-style animal-drawn farm implements and some tractors must be popularized among farmers in a planned manner within five or six years to change the past farming methods. Based on the experience of promoting new-style animal-drawn farm implements in recent years, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government decided to continue promoting 500 sets this year. Two hundred sets of these new-style animal-drawn farm implements were imported from abroad, and three hundred sets were manufactured by the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory.

The Shenyang Farm Implement Factory accepted the production task at the end of January, requiring the delivery before the end of March, so as not to delay the spring plowing of the farmers. The workers of this factory knew that their production was specifically leading the farmers to a happy socialist society, so they tried every means to overcome difficulties such as incomplete mechanical equipment, insufficient raw materials, and lack of experience, so that the farm implements were delivered on time. For example, a large number of castings on this batch of farm implements would have to be delayed until June if the normal production speed was followed, by which time the farmers would already be weeding. Yang Shouxun, the director of the workshop, studied and solved the problem, creating a sand-casting assembly line operation method, with the furnace not stopping and people not stopping, the output doubled, so that the production task could be completed on time. The structure of the seeder is more complicated, and the workers do not know how many difficulties they encountered in making the seed box on the seeder, but they all tried to overcome them. Without iron plates, everyone used the steel plates left over from making shovels instead; the iron plates were too hard, and they could not be pressed or punched, so they heated and pressed them, but they deformed after cooling, so they used hand chisels to correct them. Twenty holes of different sizes and shapes had to be punched on a seed box, and there were not enough people, so the people who drew the drawings also started to work. After the farm implements were assembled, they checked each one, and if they found any problems, they immediately reworked them until they were completely up to standard before sending them out. Each farm implement is accompanied by instructions for the convenience of farmers to learn how to operate and repair. Now most of them have been sent to the farmers, and the Beiling Farm has used the seeder made by this factory to sow part of the wheat, proving that it is completely applicable.

The successful manufacture of this batch of farm implements marks the rapid development of our country's farm implement industry. During the test at Beiling, various farm implements such as the double-wheel single-furrow plow, double-wheel double-furrow plow, roller, disc harrow, seeder, and weeder were all very easy to use, and the visitors were extremely excited. Chairman Gao Gang and Vice-Chairman Lin Feng, Minister Du Zheheng and Vice-Ministers Wei Zhenwu and Zhang Kewei of the Ministry of Agriculture all went to test them. Chairman Gao Gang also encouraged the employees of the farm implement factory to make persistent efforts, improve quality, and produce more and better new-style animal-drawn farm implements for the farmers.

### 东北第一批新式马拉农具出厂  高岗主席林枫副主席视察试用

    东北第一批新式马拉农具出厂
    高岗主席林枫副主席视察试用
    三月二十九日东北人民政府高岗主席、林枫副主席亲自视察试用第一批国产品的新式马拉农具（其中播种机系国产第一台），高岗主席和林枫副主席一一询问农具效能、成本情况，并亲手扶犁耕地，坐在圆盘耙上耙地。
    按照高岗主席指示——必须有计划地在五、六年之内，使农民普遍使用新式马拉农具和部分的拖拉机，改变过去的耕作方法。东北人民政府农业部根据几年来推广新式马拉农具的经验，决定今年继续推广五百套。这批新式马拉农具由国外进口二百套，由沈阳农具工厂制造三百套。
    沈阳农具工厂在一月末接受了生产任务，要求在三月末以前出厂，以便不误农民春耕使用。这个厂的工人知道他们的生产就是具体地领导着农民走向幸福的社会主义社会，所以想尽办法，克服了机械设备不全、原料不够、缺乏经验等困难，而使农具按时出厂。比如这批农具上的大量铸件，如按平时生产速度，就得拖到六月才能完成，那时农民就已在铲地了。车间主任杨守训研究解决办法，创造了翻砂流水作业法，炉不停火，人不停手，产量增加一倍，就使得生产任务能够按时完成。播种机的构造是较复杂的，工人为了造播种机上的种子盒，也不知遇到多少困难，但是都想法克服了。没有铁板，大家就用做铁锹剩下的钢板代替；铁板太硬，压形、打眼都不行，他们就烧热压形，但在冷却之后又变形了，就用手错打。一个种子盒上要打二十个大小形状不同的眼，人手不够，画图的人也动起手来。农具装成之后，他们台台都检查，发现毛病马上返工，一直到完全合乎规格才发出去。每台农具都附有说明书，便于农民学习操纵和修理。现在绝大部分都发到农民手里，北陵农场已用这个工厂制出的播种机播完一部分小麦，证明完全适用。
    这批农具的制造成功，标志着我们祖国农具工业将迅速发展。在北陵试验时，双轮一铧犁、双轮二铧犁、镇压器、圆盘耙、播种机、铲?机各种农具都很好使，参观的人兴奋异常。高岗主席和林枫副主席，农业部杜者蘅部长和魏震五、张克威副部长都前往试用，高岗主席并勉励农具工厂职工，要再接再厉，提高质量，为农民生产出更多更好的新式马拉农具来。（东北日报）
