Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS):

    Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Please allow me, in my capacity as Chairman of the All-Soviet Chamber of Commerce, to welcome you, the representatives of the Soviet Union attending this conference.

    Among these representatives are leaders of the Soviet economy, industrial and trade workers, economists, trade union workers, and cooperative workers. Our Soviet representatives here are all active workers in various sectors of the Soviet economy and are closely connected with the entire economic life of our country.

    The purpose of this conference is of great significance to most countries in the world. This purpose is to seek the possibility of improving living conditions through peaceful cooperation between countries and between different systems, and through the development of economic relations between countries.

    As you all know, the preparatory committee for the International Economic Conference discussed this issue at a meeting held in Copenhagen last October, where representatives from various social circles and industries exchanged opinions.

    The committee's resolution to convene the International Economic Conference reflects the common views of broad sections of society and industry in many countries.

    Today, in this hall, people with various different viewpoints and political opinions from over forty countries are gathered together, dedicated to a noble cause.

    This conference is the largest international gathering of an economic nature ever held.

    Participating in this conference are representatives from factories, businesses, banks, cooperative organizations, trade agencies, trade union and social leaders, and economists from many countries.

    The authoritative composition of this conference enables it to effectively study the main aspects of international economic cooperation.

    The outcome of this conference largely depends on the wishes and goodwill of those of us participating in the discussions. We can take this opportunity to broadly and freely exchange views on the ways and means of expanding international trade relations.

    As Chairman of the All-Soviet Chamber of Commerce, whose duty it is to promote foreign trade, I am deeply honored to report to this esteemed gathering that the Soviet trade and industrial authorities approve of the proposal to convene the International Economic Conference. Business people in many countries hope to expand trade with the Soviet Union, and it can be stated with certainty that all the possibilities for this exist.

    The fact that the proposal to convene this conference has received such active support in many countries proves that expanding international economic cooperation and trade relations has become a matter of pressing urgency. The weakening of these relations and the erection of artificial barriers to them in the past few years are causing considerable concern.

    Originally, international trade had rapidly recovered and developed smoothly in the early stages after the end of World War II, but in the past three or four years, its development has sharply deteriorated, and trade has fallen into an increasingly serious state of disarray. This is a fact.

    This deterioration of international economic relations is causing a contraction of peaceful industries and is having a detrimental impact on the living standards of people in many countries. In particular, as many countries have begun to shift to a wartime economy, the trade volume of many goods that are of great importance to the development of peaceful economies and to meeting the needs of the people has decreased. This conference is well aware of these facts, and we cannot turn a blind eye to them.

    The disintegration of international economic relations has also had an adverse impact on economically backward countries. Their economic development has been hindered because they cannot obtain the necessary equipment.

    Because of the strict control actually imposed by foreign countries over their raw material resources, they cannot trade with other countries on a mutually beneficial basis.

    Restoring and expanding normal international trade and other economic relations will certainly help improve the situation of many countries and raise the living standards of their people.

    Our country will contribute to the expansion of normal economic relations, thereby contributing to the promotion of international cooperation. Soviet trade agencies will never refuse to increase their trade with the industrial and commercial sectors of other countries, as long as these relations are based on mutual benefit and strict adherence to contractual obligations. As for the Soviet Union, as everyone knows, Soviet trade agencies have always strictly adhered to the obligations they have undertaken.

    Speaking of the fact that our Soviet trade agencies are in favor of developing international trade, I believe it is necessary to emphasize that they do not want to squeeze anyone out of the world market, nor do they want to obtain any special privileges for themselves. They believe that as long as normal conditions are obtained, foreign trade is beneficial to all parties concerned, and makes it possible for everyone to make the most effective use of the various economic opportunities provided by the international division of labor. Therefore, international trade may become another factor in creating all-round economic progress.

    As you all know, differences in economic systems need not be an obstacle to international cooperation.

    The economic development of the Soviet Union is based on the continued expansion of the domestic market and the continuous improvement of the people's purchasing power.

    Because of the abundance and variety of natural resources, and because industry and agriculture have reached a high level of development in the Soviet era, the Soviet Union possesses everything it needs to promote its economy and expand trade with other countries.

    It goes without saying that our country is in favor of expanding international economic relations, and since the end of the war, although our trade with some Western countries has decreased, and in some cases has completely stopped, due to many reasons that do not depend on us, during this period, our country has still greatly expanded its trade with the outside world.

    According to customs reports, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume now reaches more than 18 billion rubles per year, which, calculated at comparable prices, is approximately three times the pre-war level.

    The reduction in trade between the Soviet Union and other countries in recent years has not prevented it from smoothly implementing its economic plans, nor has it hindered its continuous economic progress. On the contrary, this situation has in some cases helped to accelerate the development of new industries in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Union's industrial output in 1951 was twice the level of 1940, and the output of some sectors was even higher. For example, the total output of the Soviet Union's machinery industry in 1951 was 2.8 times the output of 1940.

    Moreover, the rapid progress of the Soviet economy has created new potential for expanding trade relations with other countries.

    Everyone knows that trade between the Soviet Union and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has reached a considerable amount and is continuing to increase, while trade with the German Democratic Republic is developing on a solid foundation. Trade with the great People's Republic of China has also increased rapidly in recent years. The prospects for trade between the Soviet Union and China are bound to be very bright. The long-term economic agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and these countries stipulate that trade volume will be greatly increased.

    In the first few years after the war, economic relations between the West and the Soviet Union were successfully restored and expanded. The new trade agreements concluded between Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland and the Soviet Union in the period from 1946 to 1948 prove this.

    Now, business circles in many countries have expressed the hope to increase trade with the Soviet Union. If the proposed expansion of trade is based on equality and mutual benefit, with the interests of both parties respected, and without attaching economic or political conditions, our trade agencies welcome this expression. That is to say, if any form of discrimination is eliminated, Soviet trade agencies can agree to increase trade. Our foreign trade agencies are prepared to consider specific proposals for expanding trade along these lines.

    The All-Soviet Chamber of Commerce has studied the possibility of expanding Soviet trade with Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.

    Assuming that business circles in various countries hold a sincere desire to expand trade with Soviet trade agencies, the Soviet Union is prepared to greatly expand trade with these countries.

    The All-Soviet Chamber of Commerce has collected some statistics that clearly demonstrate what can be achieved in this regard.

    Soviet foreign trade agencies can purchase goods that they usually export from Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia, and sell goods manufactured in the Soviet Union that these countries need. In terms of quantity, the total trade volume between the Soviet Union and these countries can be increased to 30 billion or 40 billion rubles in the next two or three years, or 10 billion to 15 billion rubles per year, while the highest amount after the war only reached approximately 5 billion rubles in 1948.

    Increasing trade between the Soviet Union and Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia to this amount does not mean that the highest amount that can no longer be increased has been reached. It should be remembered that in 1931, trade between the Soviet Union and these countries reached approximately 11 billion rubles, calculated at the prices at that time, and now the potential for both Soviet imports and exports has been enhanced incomparably.

    This plan for developing trade means that the Soviet Union's total annual trade volume in the next two or three years can be increased by one and a half to two times compared to the current amount of 18 billion rubles per year that I mentioned.

    Needless to say, Soviet trade agencies will consider suggestions including long-term suggestions with great interest.

    One of the most important benefits of increasing trade is increasing the number of employed people. If the Soviet Union's trade increases to the amount I mentioned, the countries that increase trade with our country will increase the number of employed people by 1.5 million to 2 million. Soviet purchases in large quantities and a large increase in the import of raw materials and semi-finished products from the Soviet Union are two important factors in increasing the number of employed people in Western European industry.

    Soviet foreign trade agencies can purchase general consumer goods mainly from Western European companies during the aforementioned period. At the same time, raw materials, metals, and other goods, including raw materials for manufacturing consumer goods, are purchased mainly in Southeast Asia, the Near East, and the Middle East.

    These purchases can reach a total amount of 8 billion to 12 billion rubles. Contrary to previous years, if conditions and circumstances are suitable, especially in textiles, leather goods, food, and other general consumer goods, the value of goods purchased by the Soviet Union will be quite large, and the quantity will also increase day by day.

    The materials we received from our foreign trade agencies indicate that in the next two or three years, orders for machinery and equipment, merchant ships, and fishing vessels may reach a value of 7 billion to 10 billion rubles. The machinery, hardware, and other industries in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Italy, West Germany, the United States, and other countries will obtain a stable market from this, and their opportunities to sell products will be much wider than they are now.

    On the other hand, assuming that there are normal trade conditions, Soviet foreign trade agencies can increase the sales volume of their grain, timber, pulp, mineral ores, fertilizers, coal, petroleum products, flax, various industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, transportation equipment, and light industrial products to countries that need these goods. In the next two or three years, they can supply machinery and equipment worth 3 billion rubles to Southeast Asia, the Near East, and the Far East in particular.

    The Soviet Union has great potential to increase trade with the United Kingdom.

    Before the war, British companies were important buyers of some Soviet export goods, such as grain, timber, and petroleum products, and Soviet import organizations were major buyers of various British manufactured goods, and also large buyers of raw materials.

    If the British business community hopes to expand business relations with the Soviet Union, Soviet import and export trade agencies can greatly increase trade with British companies, making the trade volume reach the highest figure before the war; calculated at current prices, the trade volume in 1937 was 2.5 billion rubles. Not only can the trade volume of those goods that have always been bought and sold in Anglo-Soviet trade be increased, but the Soviet Union can also increase the number of purchases of textiles, spices, herring, etc.

    Soviet foreign trade agencies can increase the quantity of Soviet purchases of French goods and the quantity of Soviet sales of Soviet goods in France by five or six times, making the trade volume reach a figure exceeding the highest pre-war trade volume.

    Our foreign trade agencies can supply the French market with grain, timber, manganese ore and chromium ore, anthracite coal, coal, asphalt, asbestos, fur, and other goods, in exchange for French power equipment, crane equipment and transportation equipment, ships, lead, rolled metal, chemical products, gasoline, textiles, rayon, yarn, and cocoa powder, beans, citrus fruits, spices, cork, and other various goods.

    There is also great potential for the development of Soviet trade with Italy.

    If the Italian business community hopes to develop business with the Soviet Union, trade between the Soviet Union and Italy can certainly be much higher than the current figure, and can significantly exceed the pre-war highest trade volume of 540 million rubles (calculated at current prices).

    Soviet foreign trade agencies can purchase large quantities of goods that Italy has always exported, such as: electrical equipment, cranes, ball bearings, cables, textiles, rayon, yarn, gasoline, citrus fruits, almonds, chemical products, etc. Soviet orders for ships will more than double the output of Italian ships and will increase the business of Italian shipyards. Soviet orders for textiles will greatly help to increase the business of Italian companies.

    In order to pay for these Italian goods, Soviet foreign trade agencies can transport large quantities of grain, timber, coal, diesel oil, paraffin wax, iron ore and manganese ore, asbestos, and other important goods to Italy.

    Regarding the possibility of developing Soviet trade with the Netherlands, I can say this:

    Before the war, Dutch companies supplied our country with electrical equipment, ships, rubber, chemical products and pharmaceuticals, sisal hemp, herring, and other goods. The Soviet Union accounted for a large part of the Netherlands' import trade of goods such as rye, barley, wheat, and timber and manganese ore.

    Business between the Soviet Union and the Netherlands can now be significantly expanded, as long as Dutch companies are willing to develop business relations with Soviet foreign trade agencies. Soviet business agencies can increase orders for ships, crane equipment, and radio equipment, and can purchase large quantities of rubber, tin, rayon, herring, and other goods. Soviet foreign trade agencies can supply grain, timber, and coal in exchange.

    Before the war, Soviet trade with Belgian companies was booming. It is enough for me to draw attention to the fact that Soviet exports accounted for a large part of the import trade of goods such as timber, wheat, and manganese ore that Belgium needed.

    If the Belgian business community hopes to develop mutually beneficial trade, then Soviet foreign trade agencies are prepared not only to restore but also to exceed the pre-war trade volume, which reached more than 300 million rubles, calculated at current prices. Soviet foreign trade agencies can supply most of the goods that Belgium needs, and can import the goods that our country has always purchased in Belgium in large quantities, namely electrical equipment, crane equipment, and other industrial equipment, ships, rolled metal (ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals), and can also purchase rayon, fibers, and consumer goods.

    Our trade with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland also has the possibility of significant expansion.

    There is further potential for increasing our trade with Finland. Soviet-Finnish trade has grown significantly in recent years, and now there is a long-term trade agreement as a basis.

    Our foreign trade agencies are doing a lot of business with the German Democratic Republic, and can establish economic ties with the business community in West Germany. Our foreign trade agencies can order from West Germany those goods that Germany has always exported to the Soviet Union, worth at least 2 billion rubles, and deliver them in the next two or three years. West German companies can receive orders for machine tools, electrical equipment, metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, pumping equipment and pressing equipment, rolling mills, etc., and can purchase grain, timber, manganese ore and chromium ore, petroleum products, and other goods in the Soviet Union.

    Mr. Schachner, the representative of Austria, said that small countries are in a particularly difficult position. People should agree with this statement. However, it would be wrong to hold a fatalistic view or to endorse those unpromising doctrines that are permeated with Malthusian pessimism. We would not be holding this conference if we thought there was no way to solve the current difficulties.

    There is great potential for the development of Soviet-American trade. Everyone will remember that in the post-war period, many American companies did a lot of booming business with Soviet foreign trade agencies. And if the American business community hopes to develop trade with the Soviet Union, Soviet import trade agencies will order various goods from the United States worth a total of 4 billion to 5 billion rubles to be delivered in the next two or three years. And there are opportunities to expand the trade volume even further. Soviet foreign trade agencies can supply American companies with a large number of goods they want in exchange.

    Mr. Vickery of the United States spoke here in defense of free trade; he clearly does not support discriminatory policies. His speech has attracted everyone's attention. I cannot but point out his efforts.

    There is considerable room for the development of business between the Soviet Union and Latin American countries. Soviet foreign trade agencies can purchase sisal hemp, wool, leather, coffee, bananas, pineapples, tannin extract, non-ferrous metals, etc. from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and other Latin American countries, and exchange them for industrial products, machinery (including agricultural machinery), timber, cement, and other goods.

    Soviet business agencies can also resume trade relations with Japan, as long as Japanese companies have the same desire. Our country can purchase large quantities of silk, textiles, industrial equipment, ships, and citrus fruits in Japan, and exchange them for coal, timber, pulp, asbestos, chemical products, pharmaceuticals, and other goods.

    Representatives of Western industry and commerce, no matter which sector of import and export trade they are interested in, can take advantage of their stay in Moscow to contact the relevant Soviet authorities to discuss transactions.

    Soviet trade agencies are able to develop mutually beneficial trade with Southeast Asia, the Near East, and the Middle East. They can order goods that these countries have always exported, such as rubber, non-ferrous metals, ramie, cotton, shellac, tea, spices, quinine, medicinal bark, coconut kernels, castor beans, citrus fruits, bananas, and tobacco, and exchange them for industrial products and equipment especially for the metallurgical, fuel, and chemical industries, as well as equipment for the light and food industries. This will enable these countries to process their own raw materials.

    Soviet industrial agencies can also provide technical assistance in the design and construction of industrial enterprises, power plants, and irrigation systems. The Soviet Union can supply these countries with tractors and various agricultural machines to help develop their agriculture.

    Soviet foreign trade agencies are prepared to establish and develop trade relations with business circles in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Malaya, and other countries in Southeast Asia. Just mentioning a country like India is enough to show that there are potential and broad hopes for expanding trade in that part of Asia. Soviet representatives will discuss the issue of trade with these countries in more detail in the working group on economically backward countries.

    Businessmen from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries who are visiting Moscow for the first time can take this opportunity to establish business contacts with Soviet foreign trade agencies and discuss all issues related to them. Businessmen from both East and West in Moscow are probably already aware of the addresses of the Soviet companies that interest them. In any case, the environment in Moscow facilitates new contacts and the establishment of new transactions for businessmen.

    The payment procedures used by Soviet trade agencies are not only no worse than the procedures of other countries, but are also more flexible. Practice has proven that Soviet foreign trade agencies usually have no difficulty in arranging mutually acceptable and beneficial payment methods.

    Soviet trade agencies are prepared to engage in barter trade and accept the currencies of various countries as payment for goods, and use these currencies in the countries concerned. In view of the foreign exchange difficulties experienced by many countries, barter trade and paying for goods in their own currencies will certainly make a great contribution to expanding trade.

    Our agencies can also implement payments through national banks, eliminating the services of foreign banks, and in this way give national banks more business and promote the work of international foreign trade agencies.

    The problem of balancing payments with the dollar area is a particularly acute problem for most European countries. If Western countries, while trading with the United States, also restore and develop their trade with Eastern Europe on the basis of mutual barter, the acuteness of this problem will be greatly reduced. However, the trade between these countries and Eastern Europe has been reduced to almost one-third compared to the pre-war trade volume.

    Finally, let me say once again that the first necessary condition for restoring and expanding international commercial relations is to eliminate any form of discrimination. I do not need to talk about arbitrary facts such as the economic blockade imposed by the United States on China, which is only a manifestation of the policy of aggression.

    The serious dislocations in international trade caused by the arms expansion and discriminatory policies pursued by the ruling groups in some countries inevitably worsen the economic situation of many countries and force a reduction in living standards. The economies of backward countries suffer even more unfortunate effects and are filled with the danger of serious economic difficulties.

    It is for this reason that we want to ask ourselves the question that is asked every day by millions of ordinary men and women. This question is: What can be done to reduce the difficulties in international economic relations?

    These difficulties can be reduced by rebuilding and expanding trade and economic relations between countries, and by restoring and developing peaceful industries that have been cut back.

    World trade can be promoted through trade agreements, including multilateral and long-term agreements, with the aim of increasing trade in food, timber, coal, fertilizers, metals, machinery, textiles, and other goods.

    Concluding agreements with economically backward countries that stipulate the supply of industrial equipment and materials they need in exchange for raw materials and other goods produced by these countries will also facilitate the expansion of world trade. These agreements, based on the principle of mutual benefit, respecting national sovereignty, and non-interference in the internal affairs of backward countries, can have a good impact on the development of the national economies of these countries and can help improve the living standards of these people.

    The purpose of holding this conference is to promote international trade. This is the desire of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is understandable that our country's trade policy fully conforms to these desires, because our country's trade policy stems from the nature of the Soviet state. On this point, I would like to reiterate a sentence spoken by the leader of the Soviet government, J.V. Stalin, who said: "All those who desire peace and hope to establish commercial relations with us will always receive our support."

    The establishment of broad trade relations between the Soviet Union and other countries, coupled with a universal increase in world trade, will be a major contribution to international cooperation and will help alleviate economic difficulties and create conditions conducive to raising living standards and improving international relations. In this way, international affairs will achieve greater stability.

    Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that our conference will be fruitful and will be in the interests of hundreds of millions of people. (Applause)

    全苏商会主席奈斯特洛夫在五日国际经济会议上的演说全文
    主席先生，各位女士，各位先生：请允许我以全苏商会主席的资格，代表苏联出席这个会议的代表向你们表示欢迎。
    这些代表之中有苏联经济界领袖、工业和贸易工作者、经济学家、工会工作者和合作社工作者。我们在这儿的苏联代表都是苏联经济各部门的积极工作者，而且跟我国整个的经济生活有着密切的联系。
    我们举行这个会议的目的对于世界上大多数的国家有着重大的意义，这个目的就是经由各国间和各种制度间的和平合作，经由发展各国间经济关系来寻求改善生活状况的可能性。
    各位都已知道，国际经济会议发起人委员会去年十月间在哥本哈根举行的会议曾经讨论过这个问题，各国社会人士与实业界的代表们在这个会议上交换了意见。
    委员会关于召开国际经济会议的决议，反映出许多国家的社会与实业界广大阶层所共有的意见。
    今天，在这个大厅里，来自四十多个国家的具有各种不同的观点和政治见解的人们聚首一堂，致力于一项崇高的事业。
    我们这个会议是自来举行过的规模最大的一次国际经济性质的集会。
    参加这个会议的有许多国家工厂、商号、银行、合作社组织、贸易机关的代表，工会和社会领袖以及经济学家。
    这个会议成分的权威性使它可以有效地研究国际经济合作的主要方面。
    这个会议的成果大部分决定于我们参与讨论的人们的愿望与善意，我们可以借这个机会就扩大国际贸易关系的途径与方法广泛而自由地交换意见。
    我以职司促进对外贸易的全苏商会主席的资格，深感荣幸地向这个可敬的集会报告：苏联贸易与工业的行政部门都赞同召开国际经济会议的主张。许多国家的商业人士希望扩大对苏联的贸易，因此可以确定地说：关于这一点的一切可能性是存在着的。
    召开这个会议的主张在许多国家中得到这样积极的支持，这就证明了扩大国际经济合作与贸易关系已成为当务之急，过去几年中这种关系的削弱以及对这种关系树立人为的障碍正在引起不小的忧虑。
    本来在第二次世界大战结束初期，国际贸易曾迅速恢复而且顺利地发展起来，但在过去的三四年中，它的发展却急剧地恶化了，而且贸易也陷于越来越严重的紊乱状态之中，这是一个事实。
    国际经济关系的这种恶化正在引起和平工业的紧缩，而且对于许多国家的人民生活水准产生了一种有害的影响。尤其是因为许多国家开始转入战时经济，对于和平经济的发展以及对于满足人民的需要具有极大重要性的许多物品的贸易额都已降低了。这个会议对于这些事实是很清楚的，我们对这些事实不能熟视无睹。
    国际经济关系的解体对于经济落后的国家也发生了不利的影响。它们因为得不到必要的设备，经济发展都受到了妨碍。
    由于外国对它们的原料资源实际上强迫实行了严格的控制，它们都不能在相互有利的基础上与其他国家进行贸易。
    恢复并扩大正常国际贸易和其他经济关系，对于改善许多国家的处境以及提高它们人民的生活水准一定会有帮助。
    我国对于扩大正常的经济关系会有贡献，因而对于促进国际合作也会有帮助。苏联的贸易机关决不拒绝增加它们与其他国家工商业界的贸易，只要这种关系以相互间的利益和严格遵守合同义务为基础。至于苏联，大家都知道，苏联的贸易机关一向是严格遵守它们所承担的义务的。
    说到我们苏联贸易机关赞成发展国际贸易这一点，我认为必须强调指出：它们不想把任何人从世界市场上排挤掉，也不想为自己获得任何特权。它们认为：只要得到正常的条件，对外贸易对于有关各方都是有利的，并且使得大家可能最有效地来利用国际分工所提供的各种经济的机会。因此，国际贸易又可能成为造成各方面经济进步的又一个因素。
    各位都已知道，经济制度的不同不必成为国际合作的障碍。
    苏联的经济发展是以继续扩大国内市场和不断提高人民购买力为基础的。
    因为天然资源丰富而且繁多，同时因为工农业在苏维埃时代达到了高度的发展水平，苏联拥有促进它的经济及扩大与他国的贸易所需的一切。
    用不着证明，我国是赞成扩大国际经济关系的，而且自从战争结束以后，虽然由于并非取决于我们这方面的许多原因，我们与某些西方国家的贸易已经减少，有些场合已经完全停顿，但在这段时期中，我国仍大大地扩大了它与外界的贸易。
    根据海关的报告，苏联的对外贸易额现在一年已达一百八十亿卢布以上，如果以比较价格来计算，大约相当战前的三倍。
    最近几年来，苏联和其他国家的贸易的减少，并没有妨碍它顺利实行它的经济计划，也没有妨碍它经济方面继续不断的进步。相反，这种情势在若干事例中反而帮助加速了苏联新工业的发展。
    一九五一年的苏联工业产量为一九四○年水平的两倍，若干部门的产量更要多些。例如，一九五一年苏联机器工业的全部产量为一九四○年产量的二点八倍。
    不但如此，苏联经济上的迅速的进步，已经为扩充对其他国家的贸易关系创造了新的潜力。
    人人都知道：苏联和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的贸易，已经达到相当多的数量，并在继续不断地增加，而对德意志民主共和国的贸易则正在一个牢固的基础上发展。对伟大的中华人民共和国的贸易，近年来也在迅速增加。苏、中两国贸易的前途必然是很美好的。苏联和这些国家缔结的长期的经济协定，规定贸易额还要大量增加。
    在战后最初几年中，西方和苏联的经济关系是顺利地恢复和扩大了的。在一九四六到一九四八年这一时期，瑞典、英国、比利时、芬兰、荷兰、挪威、丹麦、意大利及瑞士等国和苏联缔结的新贸易协定，便证明了这一点。
    现在，许多国家的实业界表示希望增加对苏贸易。倘若建议中的扩大贸易是建立在双方平等与互利的基础上，双方的利益受到尊重，而不附带经济上或政治上的条件，我国贸易机关是欢迎这种表示的。这就是说：如果杜绝任何一种歧视，苏联贸易机关可以同意增加贸易。我国对外贸易机关准备考虑循着这些途径扩充贸易的一些特别的建议。
    全苏商会曾经研究苏联贸易和西欧、美洲、东南亚、中东、非洲及澳大利亚扩大贸易的可能性。
    假定各国实业界对于和苏联贸易机关扩充贸易一事抱着诚恳的愿望，苏联准备大量扩充和这些国家的贸易。
    全苏商会已经搜集了一些统计资料，这些资料确切地证明了在这一方面能够获得什么成就。
    苏联对外贸易机关可以在西欧、美洲、东南亚、中东、非洲和澳大利亚各国购买它们通常出口的货物，而把这些国家所需要的苏联制造的物品卖给它们，就数量而论，在最近两三年内可以把苏联和这些国家的全部贸易额提高到三百亿或四百亿卢布，或一年一百亿到一百五十亿卢布，而战后的最高额在一九四八年也不过达到大约五十亿卢布。
    苏联和西欧、美洲、东南亚、中东、非洲和澳大利亚各国的贸易增加到这一个数量，也并不是已经达到不可能再提高的最高额，应该记得，在一九三一年，苏联和这些国家的贸易，以当时的价格计算，便曾达到一百一十亿卢布左右，而现在苏联进出口贸易双方面的潜力都较前无比地增强了。
    这一个发展贸易的计划，意味着在以后两三年内苏联每年贸易总额较我所说的目前每年一百八十亿卢布的数量可以增至一倍半甚至两倍。
    不消说，苏联贸易机关将抱着极大的兴趣考虑包括长时期的建议。
    增加贸易的最重要的收获之一，便是增加就业的人数。倘若苏联的贸易增加到我所提及的那一种数量，在增加对我国的贸易的那些国家，便将增加一百五十万到二百万名的就业人数。苏联大量的购买和大量增加从苏联输入的原料和半制品，在增加西欧工业就业人数方面是两个重要的因素。
    苏联对外贸易机关可以在上述时期内购买主要来自西欧各公司的一般消费物品。和这同时，是在以东南亚、近东和中东为主的地方购买原料、金属和其他货物，包括制造消费物品的原料在内。
    这些购买量可以到达总计从八十亿到一百二十亿卢布的数额。和前几年相反，倘若条件和环境合适的话，特别在纺织品、皮革制品、食品、和其他一般消费品方面，苏联所购买的货品的价值将是相当大的，同时数量也将日益增加。
    我们从我国对外贸易机关收到的材料说明，今后二、三年内机器与设备，商船与渔船方面的定货，价值可能达七十亿到一百亿卢布。英国、比利时、法国、意大利、西德、美国和其他国家的机器、五金及别的一些工业，就会从这上面获得一个稳定的市场，它们销售生产品的机会比现在要广泛的多。
    在另一方面，假定有了正常的贸易条件，苏联对外贸易机关就可以把增加其五谷、木材、纸浆、矿砂、肥料、煤炭、油类制品、亚麻、各式工业设备、农业机器、运输工具以及轻工业品等的销售量，卖给需要这些货物的国家。在以后二三年内，它们可以特别以价值三十亿卢布的机器和设备供应给东南亚、近东和远东。
    苏联有巨大的潜力增加对英国的贸易。
    战前英国公司是苏联一些出口货物，如五谷、木材、油类制品等的重要的买主，苏联进口组织是英国各式机器制造品的主要的买主，同时又是原料的大量购买者。
    假使英国商界方面希望与苏联扩大商务关系，苏联进出口贸易机关都可以大大增加与英国各公司的贸易，使贸易额达到战前最高数字；照目前价格计算，一九三七年贸易额是二十五亿卢布。不仅可以增加英、苏通商中向来买卖的那些货物的贸易额，并且苏联更可以增加采购纺织品、香料、青鱼等等的数额。
    苏联对外贸易机关可以把苏联采购法国货的数量和在法国销售苏联货的数量增加到五倍或六倍，使贸易额达到超过战前最高贸易额的数字。
    我国对外贸易机关可以用谷物、木材、锰矿砂和铬矿砂、无烟煤、煤炭、沥青、石绒、毛皮及其他货物供给法国市场，以换取法国的电力设备、起重机设备和运输设备、船只、铅、辗金属、化学制品、挥发油、纺织品、人造丝、纱以及可可粉、豆类、柑橘类水果、香料、软木及其他各种货物。
    苏联对意大利贸易的发展也有广大的潜能。
    假使意大利商界方面希望与苏联发展商务，苏、意两国之间的贸易就一定可以大大高出目前数字，而且可以很显著地超过战前最高贸易额五亿四千万卢布（照目前价格计算）的水平。
    苏联对外贸易机关可以在意大利大量采购意大利向来输出的货物如：电力设备、起重机、球轴承、电缆、纺织品、人造丝、纱、挥发油、柑橘类水果、杏仁、化学制品等等。苏联订购船只会使意大利船只的输出增加到双倍以上，会使意大利的各造船厂的业务增加。苏联订购纺织品对于增加意大利各公司的业务大有帮助。
    苏联对外贸易机关为了支付这些意大利货物的货款，可以运送大量谷物、木材、煤炭、柴油、石蜡、铁矿砂和锰矿砂、石绒和其他重要货物到意大利去。
    关于苏联和荷兰贸易发展的可能性，我可以这样说：
    在战前，荷兰各公司曾以电气设备、船只、橡胶、化学制品和药用品、西沙尔麻、青鱼等货供给我国。而荷兰所需黑麦、大麦、小麦、木材、锰矿砂等货的进口贸易中苏联则占一大部分。
    苏荷两国间的商务现在可以很显著地予以扩大，只要荷兰各公司愿意与苏联对外贸易机关发展业务关系。苏联商务机关可以增加船只、起重机设备及无线电器材的定货，可以采购大量的橡胶、锡、人造纤维、青鱼及其他货物。苏联对外贸易机关可以供给谷物、木材及煤炭这些重要货物以便交换。
    在战前，苏联与比利时各公司贸易兴旺。在比利时所需木材、小麦和锰矿砂等货的进口贸易中，苏联出口货曾占很大一部分，我只要唤起注意这一件事就够了。
    假使比利时商界方面希望发展互相有利的贸易，那么苏联对外贸易机关就准备不仅恢复而且超过战前贸易额，照目前价格计算，战前贸易额曾达三亿卢布以上。苏联对外贸易机关可以供给比利时所需要的大部分货物，可以输入我国一向在比利时采购的数量颇大的货物，即电力设备、起重机设备和其他工业设备、船只辘金属（黑色金属和有色金属），还可采购人造丝、纤维和大众消费物品。
    我国与瑞典、挪威、丹麦及瑞士的贸易也都有很显著的扩大的可能。
    我国与芬兰的贸易有更进一步增加的潜能，苏芬贸易近年来已很显著地增长了，现在更有一个长期贸易协定作基础。
    我国对外贸易机关与德意志民主共和国做着很大的生意，并且可以与西德商界建立经济联系。我国对外贸易机关可以向西德订购德国一向对苏联输出的那些货物，价值至少可达二十亿卢布，并在今后两三年内交货。西德各公司可以得到关于工作母机、电气设备、冶金设备、采矿设备、抽水机和压榨机设备、辗钢等定货，可以在苏联采购谷物、木材、锰矿砂和铬矿砂、油类制品及其他货物。
    奥地利的代表沙希纳先生说小国已处于特别困难的地位。人们应该同意这一句话。但是，如果抱着宿命论的见解，或者如果赞成那些渗透着马尔萨斯悲观主义的没有前途的学说，那就错误了。如果我们认为目前的困难没有解决的途径，我们就不会举行这次会议了。
    苏美贸易的发展有极大的潜能。大家会记起：在战后时期中，许多美国公司曾和苏联对外贸易机关做过很兴旺的生意。而假使美国商界方面希望发展对苏贸易，苏联进口贸易机关就会向美国订购在今后两三年内交货的共值四、五十亿卢布的各种货物。而且贸易额还有更加扩大的机会。苏联对外贸易机关可以供给美国各公司所要的大量货物以便交换。
    美国的维克利先生在这里发言维护自由贸易；他显然不支持歧视政策。他的演说词已引起大家注意。我不能不指出他的努力。
    苏联和拉丁美洲各国之间的商务颇有发展余地。苏联对外贸易机关可以在墨西哥、阿根廷、巴西和拉丁美洲其他各国采购西沙尔麻、羊毛、皮革、咖啡、香蕉、波萝、鞣酸精、有色金属等，而用工业品、机器（包括农业机器）、木材、水泥和其他货物去交换。
    苏联商务机关也可以与日本恢复贸易关系，只要日本各公司具有相同的愿望。我国可以在日本采购大量的丝、纺织品、工业设备、船只和柑橘类水果，而用煤炭、木材、纸浆、石绒、化学制品、药品和其他货物去交换。
    西方工商界的代表们，无论对进出口贸易的任何一个部门感到兴趣，都可以利用他们在莫斯科盘桓的机会与苏联有关机关接洽，来商谈成交。
    苏联贸易机关能够和东南亚、近东及中东各国发展互利的贸易。它们能够向这些国家订购一向出口货物，例如，橡胶、有色金属、苎麻、棉花、虫胶片、茶叶、香料、奎宁、药用树皮、椰子干核、蓖麻、柑橘类水果、香蕉和烟草类，而以工业品及特别为冶金、燃料和化学工业所用的设备，以及为轻工业和食品工业所用的设备，作为交换。这样将使这些国家能够加工处理它们自己的原料。
    苏联工业机关在设计和建造工业企业、电力厂、灌溉系统等方面也可以予以技术上的援助。苏联可以供应这些国家以拖拉机和各式农业机器，帮助发展它们的农业。
    苏联对外贸易机关准备和印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、锡兰、缅甸、泰国、马来亚和东南亚的其他国家的实业界建立并发展贸易关系。单只提到像印度这样一个国家，就足以表明在亚洲的那一部分有扩充贸易的潜在而广泛的希望了。苏联代表将在关于经济落后国家的工作小组上更详细地讨论和这些国家的贸易的问题。
    印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸和其他国家的第一次访问莫斯科的实业家们，可以利用这个机会和苏联对外贸易机关建立商业上的联系，并和它们讨论与他们有关的一切问题。现在莫斯科的来自东西双方的实业家们，大概都已知道使他们感到兴趣的苏联各公司的地址。在任何一种情况下，莫斯科的环境都便于实业家们的新接触和成立新交易。
    苏联贸易机关所用的支付手续不但决不会比其他国家的手续不好，而且比较可以通融些。惯例已经证明：苏联对外贸易机关寻常在安排彼此可以接受的和有利的支付方法时没有任何困难。
    苏联贸易机关准备成立易货贸易，收受各国自己的货币作为货款，而把这些货币用在有关各国。依照许多国家所经历的外汇困难的情形说起来，易货贸易和以各该国货币付给货款，对扩充贸易一定会有很大的贡献。
    我国机关也可以通过国家银行实行支付，以免除外国银行的服务，用这种方法给与国家银行以更多的业务，推动国际对外贸易机关的工作。
        平衡对美元区域支付的问题，是多数欧洲国家的一个特别尖锐的问题。倘若西方各国在它们和美国通商的同时，也在相互易货的基础上恢复并发展它们和东欧的贸易，这个问题的尖锐性就会减轻很多了。然而这些国家和东欧的贸易，和战前的贸易额相比，已经减少到只剩将近三分之一。
    最后，让我再说一遍，为恢复和扩充国际商业关系的第一个必要条件，便是取消任何形式的歧视。我不需要再来谈论像美国对中国实行经济封锁这类专横的事实了，那不过是侵略政策的一种表现而已。
    某些国家统治集团实行扩充军备和歧视政策在国际贸易上造成的严重的脱节状态，不可避免地使许多国家的经济情势恶化，迫使生活水准降低。落后国家的经济蒙受更不幸的影响，充满了严重的经济困难的危险。
    我们之所以要向我们自己提出为亿万普通男女每天所询问的问题，便是为了这一个缘故。这个问题就是：用什么办法去减少国际经济关系上的困难呢？
    重建并扩充各国间的贸易与经济关系，恢复并发展现被削减的和平工业，便可以使这些困难减少。
    通过贸易协定，包括多边的和长期的协定，而以增加食粮、木材、煤炭、肥料、金属、机器、纺织品和其他货物的贸易为目的，便可以促进世界贸易。
    和经济落后的国家缔结协定，规定供应这些国家以工业设备和它们所需要的物资，以交换这些国家所生产的原料和其他物品，也会便利于世界贸易的扩充。这些协定以互利的原则，尊重国家主权和不干涉落后国家的内政作为基础，对这些国家的国民经济的发展可以发生良好的影响，并可以帮助提高这些人民的生活水准。
    举行本会议的宗旨是为了促进国际贸易。这是全世界千百万人民的愿望。我国的贸易政策完全符合这些愿望，这是可以理解的，因为我国的贸易政策是从渊源于苏维埃国家的本质。关于这一点我愿意重述苏联政府领袖约·维·斯大林所说的一句话，他说：“凡是愿意和平并且希望与我们建立商业关系的人们，将永远得到我们的支持。”
    苏联和其他国家建立广泛的贸易关系，加上世界贸易的普遍的增加，对国际合作将是一个重大的贡献，并有助于减轻经济上的困难，和创造有利于提高生活水准和改善国际关系的条件，在这种方式之下，就会使国际事务达到较大的安定。
    女士们，先生们，我深信我们的会议将是有结果的，并且将符合千百万人民的利益的。（鼓掌）
