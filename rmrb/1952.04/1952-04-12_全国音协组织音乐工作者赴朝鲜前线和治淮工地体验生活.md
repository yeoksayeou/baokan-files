The All-China Musicians Association has organized musicians from various regions to experience life on the Korean front lines and at the Huai River project construction site, preparing to create a large number of popular songs.

The music creation group destined for Korea, led by group leader Fei Ke (from Southern Jiangsu), departed on the 6th. Group members include composers Cao Ke (Shanxi), Situ Han (Shanghai), Zhang Zhenya (Nanjing), Wang Zhuo (Shenyang), Zhu Fengrong (Harbin), Li Sheng, Wang Yuxi (Hebei), Song Xuejian (Shandong), Ren Ran (Chongqing), and lyricist Ming Ge (Northeast). Composers including Lan He (Chongqing) are going to the Huai River project construction site to experience life.

Before setting off to experience life, this group of musicians underwent a concentrated study period, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and the reports by Hu Qiaomu, Zhou Yang, and others at the rectification and study mobilization conference in Beijing's literary and art circles. Each person examined and summarized their creative thoughts over the years. They all held a high degree of enthusiasm for this trip to experience life, unanimously requesting to undertake various practical tasks at the front lines, so as to achieve self-transformation in the heat of the struggle.
