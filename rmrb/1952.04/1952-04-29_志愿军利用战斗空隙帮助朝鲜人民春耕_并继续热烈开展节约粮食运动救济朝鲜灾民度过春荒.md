Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 25th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units are helping Korean people with spring planting on a large scale during breaks in combat. With the help of the Volunteer Army, the land of Korean farmers near Kaesong has been mostly cultivated, planted with spring wheat and potatoes, and the sowing of millet has begun. In early March, a unit of the Volunteer Army on the eastern front invited local Korean government personnel to jointly study specific measures to help with spring planting. Many units have specifically organized spring planting assistance teams, provided that combat missions are not hindered. The soldiers also put forward the slogan "Ensure good cultivation, good planting, and good protection." A certain unit has delivered 9,065 baskets of manure and reclaimed more than 40 mu of wasteland for farmers near their station. The telephone company of a certain unit made more than 20 pieces of farm tools such as sickles and hoes, and wove more than 40 baskets, which were given to local farmers who lacked farm tools. The company also helped farmers in a certain village to deliver all the manure to the fields in five days.

In order to help many Korean people who have suffered from war disasters to overcome the spring famine and carry out spring planting in a timely manner, the Volunteer Army soldiers continue to enthusiastically carry out the movement to save grain and relieve Korean disaster victims. They said, "We are fighting for the peaceful and happy life of the Korean people, so we must not watch the Korean people go hungry." Many companies save two taels of rice per person per day to relieve Korean disaster victims. According to incomplete statistics from a certain unit alone, 314,000 catties of grain have been saved. Another unit has distributed 25,846 catties of grain saved in January to 635 farmers who have suffered deeply from American aggression. The great internationalist action of the Volunteer Army deeply moved the Korean people. An old lady named Park Wu-gil in a certain place said at an army-civilian symposium: "We are really moved by the Volunteer Army's distribution of relief grain. I will save on food and use it to work hard to increase production and support the front."

In addition, many units of the Volunteer Army have carried out tree planting and afforestation work after obtaining the consent of the Korean local government. Many mountain slopes scorched by American gasoline bombs have begun to grow green seedlings. A certain unit alone has planted 170,000 trees.

    志愿军利用战斗空隙帮助朝鲜人民春耕
    并继续热烈开展节约粮食运动救济朝鲜灾民度过春荒
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】中国人民志愿军各部队在战斗的空隙中，大规模地帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕。在志愿军帮助下，开城附近朝鲜农民的土地已大部耕完，种上春麦和土豆，并已开始播种谷子。东线志愿军某部早在三月上旬，就邀请朝鲜地方政府人员共同研究帮助春耕的具体办法。许多单位在不妨碍战斗任务的条件下，专门组织了助民春耕队。战士们并提出了“保证耕好，种好，保护好”的口号。某部已替驻地附近的农民送粪九千零六十五筐，开荒地四十多亩。某部电话连打造镰刀、镐头等农具二十多件，编筐四十多个，赠给当地缺少农具的农民。该连并在五天中帮助某村农民将粪全部送到地里。
    为了帮助许多深受战争灾害的朝鲜人民度过春荒，及时进行春耕，志愿军战士们继续热烈开展节约粮食，救济朝鲜灾民的运动。他们说：“我们为朝鲜人民和平幸福的生活而战斗，就决不能看着朝鲜人民挨饿。”许多连队每人每天节约二两米来救济朝鲜灾民。仅据某部不完全统计，已节约粮食三十
    一万四千斤。另一部队已将在一月份中节约的两万五千八百四十六斤粮食，分发给六百三十五户深受美国侵略灾害的农民。志愿军这种伟大的国际主义行动，深深感动了朝鲜人民。某地朴五吉老太太在一个军民座谈会上说：“志愿军分发救济粮真使我们感动，我要省吃节用，努力增加生产，支援前线。”
    此外，志愿军许多部队在取得朝鲜地方政府同意后，进行了植树、造林的工作。许多被美国汽油弹烧焦了的山坡上已开始长出青绿的树苗。仅某单位即已植树十七万株。
