Letter to the Editor Summary:

    Hoping Writers Create Works Reflecting the Lives of Soldiers
    We were very happy to see the news that the literary works of our country's writers Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, He Jingzhi, Ding Yi and other comrades have won the Stalin Literature Prize.
    Soldiers love works such as "The Sun Shines Over the Sangkan River" and "The Hurricane." Many soldiers, as soon as they learned to read the newspaper, held these books in their arms.
    We hope that writers, especially those who have gone into the army to experience life, will also create works that reflect the revolutionary soldiers who have undergone long and arduous struggles, filled with patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and optimism.
                                A Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhao Bo

    希望作家们创作反映战士生活的作品
    我们看到我国作家丁玲、周立波、贺敬之、丁毅等同志的文学作品荣获斯大林文学奖金的消息以后，十分高兴。
    战士们都热爱“桑乾河上”、“暴风骤雨”等作品。有很多战士刚学会看报，便把这些书抱在怀里。
    我们希望作家们，特别是这次深入部队体验生活的作家们，也创作出反映经过长期艰苦斗争的、充满爱国主义、革命英雄主义、乐观主义精神的革命战士的作品。
