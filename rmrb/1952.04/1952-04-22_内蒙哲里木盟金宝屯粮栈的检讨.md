Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    The Self-Criticism of Jinbaotun Grain Depot, Zhelimumeng League, Inner Mongolia
    To the Editors: We sincerely accept the criticism made by Liu Xun in the People's Daily on March 31st regarding our cross-border grain purchase.

    At the end of last December, our depot ordered 180,000 jin of rice from the Zhengjiatun Sino-Korean Rice Mill in Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province. Before placing the order, although we had discussed it with Huang Hengpu, the then-manager of the Zhelimumeng League Grain Company, and Fan Yeqin, the head of the business section, we did not obtain permission from the local government. We privately signed a contract with private merchants, violated the price policy, allowed the private merchants to exploit loopholes, and affected the local grain company's control over grain prices, causing losses to the state. The main reason for this mistake was our lack of an overall perspective and our failure to conscientiously study policies. Comrade Liu Xun's criticism has been of great help to us. In addition to our gratitude, we will use this lesson to examine our work, strengthen policy study, and ensure that we never repeat similar mistakes. We have already submitted a request to our superiors for strict disciplinary action regarding this mistake.

    内蒙哲里木盟金宝屯粮栈的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报三月三十一日所载刘讯对我们越境购粮的批评，我们表示诚恳接受。
    去年十二月底，我栈曾向辽西省双辽县郑家屯中朝制米厂订购大米十八万斤。在订购前，虽曾和当时哲里木盟粮食公司经理黄恒谱、业务科长范业勤谈过，但没有通过当地政府的允许，就私自和私商订了合同，并违犯了价格政策，给私商钻了空子，影响当地粮食公司对粮食价格的掌握，给国家造成了损失。造成这一错误的原因，主要是由于我们缺乏整体观念，平时对政策没有认真学习。这次刘讯同志给我们的批评，对我们有很大的帮助。我们除感谢外，将以这次的教训来检查我们的工作，加强政策学习，保证永不再犯同类错误。对这次错误，我们已呈请上级给予我们严格的处分。
