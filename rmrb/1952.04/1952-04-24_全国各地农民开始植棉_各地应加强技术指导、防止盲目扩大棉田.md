Farmers Across the Country Begin Planting Cotton
All Regions Should Strengthen Technical Guidance and Prevent Blind Expansion of Cotton Fields

[This newspaper dispatch] As the cotton planting season arrives, farmers across the country are beginning to plant cotton with great intensity. This spring, rainfall in all cotton-growing areas has been more abundant than in previous years. Rainfall in North China and Northeast China in March was slightly higher than in the same month last year. Central South, East China, and Northwest China have also had timely spring rains. The Southwest region, which was previously relatively dry, has had continuous spring rains since early April. This is extremely beneficial for cotton planting.

This year, cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. In the drought prevention and resistance movement, cotton farmers have actively opened canals, dug wells, and harrowed the land to conserve moisture, creating favorable conditions for timely planting and increased yield per unit area of cotton fields this year. Mass drought prevention and resistance movements have been launched in various cotton-growing areas in North China. Due to the opening of canals, digging of wells, and the construction of water conservancy projects, Shanxi Province has expanded its irrigated land to about one million mu. According to statistics from twenty-two counties in Shandong Province, drought prevention and well digging have exceeded the planned targets. The vast number of cotton farmers have developed mutual aid and cooperation organizations and actively carried out harrowing to preserve moisture. In the southern part of Hebei Province, a moisture preservation movement was launched as early as February this year. By the end of March, Huimin Prefecture in Shandong Province had harrowed the land six or seven times, two more times than last year, and with greater thoroughness. After the rain on March 18, farmers in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, carried out shallow plowing and fine harrowing to preserve moisture. Due to the emphasis placed on plowing and moisture preservation in various regions, the moisture content in most cotton-growing areas is currently very good, making it suitable for sowing. The supply and loan of fertilizers to cotton-growing areas by governments at all levels, state-owned economic departments, and cooperatives have been enthusiastically supported by the vast number of cotton farmers. In northern Jiangsu, the loan of fertilizers such as manure and fertilizer powder was fully completed by the end of March. By March 16, 80% of the fertilizers prepared in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, had been loaned to the masses. State-owned enterprises in the Western Sichuan Administrative Office in the Southwest region also basically solved the fertilizer supply problem for all cotton fields in the Western Sichuan area in March. The amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields in various regions has increased compared to previous years. The amount of fertilizer applied in the cotton-growing areas of North China has generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In Qi County, Henan Province, where very little fertilizer was applied to cotton fields in the past, about 2,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu has been applied this year. The supply of cotton insecticides and machinery has also been widely welcomed by cotton farmers. The People's Bank of China in the Central South region has provided twice as much loan for pesticides and machinery as last year. Farmers in various parts of Central South China have used these funds to purchase 50,000 sprayers and 3 million jin of cotton oil soap.

After the mutual aid groups led by famous cotton high-yield models Qu Yaoli and Zhang Defang launched a cotton high-yield challenge to cotton farmers and mutual aid groups across the country, a warm upsurge of production increase competition has been launched in various regions. A movement to learn advanced cultivation techniques has also been widely launched in various cotton-growing areas. Qu Yaoli has given reports on cotton planting experience to 5,000 nearby cotton farmers. Farmers in Yunnan Province in the distant Southwest and Fujian Province in East China have written to him to learn from his advanced experience and exchange cotton seeds with him. Hebei Province and other regions have also organized visiting groups to observe and learn advanced cotton planting techniques in the villages where high-yield models are located. Last winter and this spring, the agricultural and forestry departments of Shaanxi Province widely promoted agricultural technology instruction among village cadres, labor models, mutual aid group leaders, and old farmers in fifteen counties, including Jingyang in Guanzhong. These mass technical learning movements have greatly increased cotton farmers' confidence in a good cotton harvest.

At present, in the spring plowing and cotton planting production movement, the following issues still deserve attention in various regions:

1.  Now is a favorable time for cotton planting and sowing. All regions must seize the season and complete all sowing tasks in a timely manner. The sowing period in general areas should not exceed half a month (i.e., complete the sowing task in half a month); a few dry areas should immediately mobilize the masses to organize and carry water for planting. Under no circumstances should the sowing period be delayed due to waiting for rain, resulting in reduced cotton production and an increase in late-blooming cotton. At present, the threat of drought has not passed. Whether it is in areas that have rained or in dry areas, leadership at all levels must not relax their efforts in drought prevention and resistance; farmers should be educated to establish a long-term anti-drought mentality and strive for a bumper harvest of cotton fields.

2.  Conscientiously controlling cotton planting plans, preventing the blind expansion of cotton fields, and strengthening technical guidance on cotton planting to increase yield per unit area is an issue that leading cadres in cotton-growing areas must pay close attention to this year. However, at present, leading cadres in some areas have not stopped the blind expansion of cotton fields in districts and villages. If this situation is not immediately corrected, it will affect this year's grain increase task. At the same time, the specific guidance and publicity on cotton planting techniques by some cadres is also extremely inadequate. For example, cotton farmers still have concerns about the use of chemical fertilizers. In some areas, the masses are unwilling to purchase chemical fertilizers from cooperatives. For example, 30% to 50% of the 25,000 jin of chemical fertilizer in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, has not yet been loaned out. A similar situation exists in Yi County, Shanxi Province. In addition, in some areas of Shanxi Province, the bone meal that is loaned out is promoted for topdressing, which will lose its effectiveness in increasing production. All of these indicate that correct technical guidance must be provided to cotton farmers to ensure this year's cotton production increase.

    全国各地农民开始植棉
    各地应加强技术指导、防止盲目扩大棉田
    【本报讯】棉花播种季节已到，全国各地正开始紧张地种棉。今春各棉区雨量都比往年充沛，华北、东北各地三月份雨量比去年同月稍多。中南、华东、西北各地亦已及时普降春雨。原来比较干旱的西南区，已在四月上旬连降春雨。这对于棉花播种极为有利。
    今年各地棉农的生产情绪空前高涨。棉农们在防旱抗旱运动中，积极开渠凿井，耙地保墒，为今年棉田及时播种和提高单位面积产量，创造了有利的条件。华北各棉区都展开了群众性的防旱抗旱运动。山西省由于开渠凿井、兴修水利，扩大水浇地到一百万亩左右。山东省防旱打井，据二十二县统计，已超过预定计划。广大棉农发展了互助合作组织，积极地进行了耙地保墒工作。河北南部地区，今年二月就展开了保墒运动。山东惠民专区到三月底已耙地六七次，比去年多两遍，并且都很细致。河南许昌专区三月十八日下雨后，农民为了保墒，又进行了浅犁细耙工作。由于各地重视了耕耙保墒工作，目前广大棉区墒情都很良好，适宜下种。各级人民政府、国营经济部门和合作社对棉区肥料的供应贷放，已得到了广大棉农的热烈拥护。苏北的大粪、肥田粉等肥料贷款，三月底已全部完成。山西运城专区准备的肥料，到三月十六日止，已有百分之八十贷给了群众。西南区川西行署的国营企业部门，也于三月份基本上解决了川西区全部棉田肥料的供应问题。各地棉田的施肥量，都比往年增加了。华北棉区的施肥量一般比去年增加一成到二成；河南省杞县过去棉田施肥很少，今年每亩棉田也上了底肥二千斤左右。棉花杀虫药械的供应也受到了棉农的普遍欢迎。中南区人民银行的药械贷款，相当于去年的两倍多。中南各地农民已用这批款项买了喷雾器五万架、棉油皂三百万斤。
    在著名棉花丰产模范曲耀离、张德芳等领导的互助组向全国棉农及互助组发起棉花丰产挑战后，各地棉农已展开热烈的增产竞赛热潮。各棉区并广泛展开了学习先进耕作技术的运动。曲耀离曾向附近棉农五千人作过植棉经验的报告。远在西南的云南省和华东的福建省等地，都有农民写信给他，学习他的先进经验，和他交换棉花种子。河北省及其他地区，还组织了参观团到各丰产模范所在村观摩，学习植棉先进技术。陕西省农林部门，去冬今春在关中泾阳等十五个县的村干部、劳动模范、互助组长和老农中间，广泛推行了农业技术传授工作。这些群众性的技术学习运动，已大大提高了棉农对于棉花丰收的信心。
    目前，在春耕植棉生产运动中，仍有以下几个问题值得各地注意：
    1、目前正是植棉播种的有利时机，各地区务须抓紧季节，适时完成全部播种任务。一般地区的播种期应不超过半个月（即半月完成播种任务）；少数干旱地区目前应该立即动员群众组织起来，挑水点种，切不可因等雨而延迟了播种期，致使棉花减产和霜后花增多。目前干旱威胁并未过去，不论是下过雨的地区，或是干旱地区，各级领导机关对防旱抗旱工作决不能放松；应教育农民树立长期防旱的思想，为广大棉田的丰收而斗争。
    2、认真控制植棉计划、防止盲目扩大棉田，加强植棉技术指导，提高单位面积产量，是今年各地棉区领导干部必须十分注意的一个问题。但是目前部分地区的领导干部对区村的盲目扩大棉田竟不加制止，这种情况如不立刻加以纠正，将会影响今年粮食的增产任务。同时，部分干部对植棉技术的具体指导和宣传也是极不够的。如目前棉农对使用化学肥料仍有顾虑。有些地区合作社的化学肥料，群众还不愿购买。如陕西省三原县二万五千斤化学肥料，目前仍有百分之三十到五十没贷下去。山西猗氏县也有这种情况。此外，山西省贷放的骨粉，部分地区宣传作追肥施用，这对增产将会失去作用。这些都说明：必须对棉农进行正确的技术指导，才能保证今年的棉花增产。
