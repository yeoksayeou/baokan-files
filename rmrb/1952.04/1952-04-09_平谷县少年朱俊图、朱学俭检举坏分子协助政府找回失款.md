Youngsters Zhu Juntun (15 years old) and Zhu Xuejian (17 years old) from Jiangjunguan Village, Pinggu County, Hebei Province, exposed bad elements and helped the government recover 11.2 million yuan in public funds, for which they received a government reward.

Last November 5th, Li Shaorong, the director of the Kaoshanshi branch of the People's Bank of China in Pinggu County, was carrying 11.2 million yuan in public funds to Emeishan Village to issue loans. He lost the money on the way. On that day, Zhu Juntun and Zhu Xuejian were returning from the market in Kaoshanshi with the bad element Jia Baoyuan. Jia Baoyuan discovered the money Li Shaorong had lost. He hurriedly picked it up, stuffed it in his waist, and said to Zhu Juntun and Zhu Xuejian:

"When someone comes looking for it, you are not allowed to tell him, just say you didn't see it." After speaking, he slipped away along a small path. Zhu Juntun and Zhu Xuejian said as they walked, "This bad egg picked up the money and wants to keep it from the owner. We can't agree to that." When they returned to the village, they reported the matter to the village chief. Later, the lost funds were finally returned to the owner.

In order to commend Zhu Juntun and Zhu Xuejian's spirit of cherishing national property, the Pinggu County People's Government immediately rewarded them.

    平谷县少年朱俊图、朱学俭检举坏分子协助政府找回失款
    河北省平谷县将军官村少年朱俊图（十五岁）、朱学俭（十七岁），检举坏分子，帮助政府找回公款一千一百二十万元，受到了政府的奖励。
    去年十一月五日，中国人民银行平谷支行靠山集营业所主任李绍荣，携带公款一千一百二十万元，到峨嵋山村去放款。他在中途把款子遗失了。那天，朱俊图、朱学俭和坏分子贾宝元一起从靠山集赶集回来。李绍荣丢失的款子被贾宝元发现了，他就慌忙拾起，装在腰里，并向朱俊图、朱学俭说：
    “有人来找时，不准你们告诉他，就说没见到。”说完，就从小道溜走。朱俊图、朱学俭一边走一边说：“这个坏蛋拾了钱想不退还原主，我们不能答应。”回到村里，他们便把这件事报告给村长。后来，这笔失款终于归还失主。
    平谷县人民政府为了表扬朱俊图、朱学俭爱护国家财产的精神，马上奖励了他们。            高玉杰
