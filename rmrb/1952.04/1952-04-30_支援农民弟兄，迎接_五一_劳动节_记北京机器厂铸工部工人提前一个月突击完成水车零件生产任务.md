    Supporting Farmer Brothers, Welcoming the “May First” Labor Day
    -- Record of Beijing Machine Factory Foundry Workers Completing Waterwheel Parts Production Task One Month Ahead of Schedule
    Chi Dan
    The staff and workers of the Beijing Machine Factory Foundry Department enhanced their class consciousness during the “Three-Anti” movement. In order to welcome the “May First” Labor Day, in addition to completing the original production plan, they also completed the added rush task of producing two thousand four hundred waterwheel parts more than a month ahead of schedule.
    In March, in addition to its original production plan, the Beijing Machine Factory accepted the urgent task of manufacturing two thousand four hundred anti-drought waterwheel parts and four hundred minecart wheels for farmer brothers in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. The task was to be completed by the end of May. This factory had once relaxed its leadership over production during the "Three-Anti" movement, and production in January and February declined significantly. Although this deviation was later reversed, the first quarter's production plan could only be completed by about 70% because the masses were not fully mobilized and relied upon. When accepting this new task, the administrative leaders still underestimated the strength of the masses, believing that while the masses were “fighting tigers” and catching up with the first quarter's plan, it would be difficult to complete this new task on schedule. Therefore, they once planned to entrust this task to private factories. However, private factories were undergoing the “Five-Anti” movement, making it even less likely that they could complete the task. In this situation, they carefully studied the ideological sentiments of the masses with the responsible comrades of the Foundry Department, and found that as long as the policy of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to tap potential strength could be implemented, the task could be completed.
    After studying this new task, the responsible cadres of the Foundry Department’s Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League convened a general meeting of all employees and repeatedly conducted mobilization education. After the meeting, the worker masses were immediately organized to discuss and listen to the opinions of the masses. After discussion, the worker masses realized that this was a concrete action to support the farmer brothers in carrying out the anti-drought struggle and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Everyone's enthusiasm was very high, and they put forward specific guarantee measures. According to the specific circumstances, the administration drew three or four artisans and two apprentices from each group to focus on making waterwheels, and decided to complete the task on May 27. Due to the high enthusiasm of the workers, each group exceeded the task within less than a week of starting work. For example, making waterwheel dustpans was originally planned to be done by one craftsman with one apprentice making ten per day; this time the workers adopted the method of division of labor and contracting, and improved the labor organization, and as a result, many people made twenty-two to thirty per day. The workers making flange plates launched a competition; the original stipulation was that each person made seventy per day, but they actually made one hundred and seventy per day.
    The leadership of the Foundry Department seized this opportunity and summoned the workers who made waterwheels to recalculate the time to complete the task using the method of carefully calculating accounts. After calculation, according to the efficiency at that time, the task could be completed twenty-five days ahead of schedule. The workers were immediately excited when they heard it. In order to welcome the "May First" Labor Day, everyone proposed to complete the task by the end of April. As a result, the workers' energy was even greater. At this time, their operating skills became more proficient. They helped each other in production, helping each other solve problems. The workers making flange plates were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task on time because there were not enough models, so the workers making waterwheel dustpans automatically helped them make models. Soon, the workers making waterwheel dustpans made forty-two per day, and the workers making flange plates made one hundred and ninety per day. They finally completed the task one month ahead of schedule on April 27. These new records greatly encouraged the workers of the entire factory, especially the workers of the Foundry Department. The workers of the Foundry Department also achieved production according to plan. Seeing the vigorous enthusiasm of the masses, the administrative leaders reviewed their erroneous views of not believing in the strength of the masses to all employees. He said: During this period, the leading cadres were simply pushed forward by the strength of the masses; in the future, we must lead everyone forward well!

    支援农民弟兄，迎接“五一”劳动节
    ——记北京机器厂铸工部工人提前一个月突击完成水车零件生产任务
    赤丹
    北京机器厂铸工部的职工，在“三反”运动中提高了阶级觉悟；为了迎接“五一”劳动节，他们除了完成了原定生产计划，还提前一个多月完成了计划之外添加的二千四百部水车零件的突击任务。
    三月份，北京机器厂在原生产计划之外，又接受了给内蒙和绥远的农民兄弟赶制二千四百部防旱水车零件和四百部矿车轱辘的突击任务。任务限五月底完成。这个厂在“三反”运动中一度对生产放松了领导，一月份和二月份的生产显著下降。后来虽然扭转了这种偏向，但是由于没有充分发动并依靠群众，所以第一季生产计划仅能完成百分之七十左右。在接受这批新任务时，行政领导方面对于群众的力量仍然估计不足，认为群众一面“打虎”，一面追赶第一季的计划，这批新任务恐怕很难按期完成。因此，他们曾一度计划把这批任务委托给私营工厂去做。但是，私营厂正在进行“五反”，完成任务的可能更小。在这种情况下，他们和铸工部的负责同志仔细地研究了群众的思想情绪，发现只要能贯彻发动群众依靠群众挖掘潜在力量的方针，任务是可能完成的。
    铸工部党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部研究了这个新任务后，召开了全体职工大会，反复进行动员教育。会后，立即组织工人群众讨论，听取群众的意见。经过讨论，工人群众认识了这是自己支援农民弟兄进行抗旱斗争、巩固工农联盟的具体行动，大家的情绪十分高涨，纷纷提出具体的保证办法。行政方面根据具体情况，从每组抽出工匠三人或四人、徒工二人专门突击做水车，决定五月二十七日完成任务。由于工人们劳动热情高涨，开工不到一星期，各组就纷纷超额完成任务了。比如，做水车簸箕，原定一个工匠带一个徒工每天做十个；这次工人们采取了分工包做的办法，并且改善了劳动组织，结果很多人每天竟作到二十二个到三十个。做法蓝盘的工人们展开了竞赛；原规定每人每天做七十个，结果他们每人每天竟做出一百七十个。
    铸工部的领导方面抓紧这个时机，召集了做水车的工人，用算细账的办法重新计算完成任务的时间。经过计算，按照当时的效率，可以提前二十五天完成任务。工人听见后立即兴奋起来。为了迎接
    “五一”劳动节，大家提出要在四月底完成任务。这一来，工人们的劲头更大了。这时，他们的操作技术更为熟练了。他们在生产中互助友爱，彼此帮助解决问题。做法蓝盘的工人因为模型不够，恐怕不能按时完成任务，做水车簸箕的工人就自动地帮助他们做模型。不久，做水车簸箕的每天就做到四十二个，做法蓝盘的每天做到一百九十个。他们终于在四月二十七日提前一个月完成了任务。这些新纪录大大鼓舞了全厂的工人，特别是铸工部的工人。铸工部的工人也做到了按计划生产。行政领导干部看到了群众的这种蓬勃的热情，向全体职工检讨了他们不相信群众力量的错误观点。他说：这个时期领导干部简直是让群众的力量推着往前跑；今后可要好好领导大家前进了！
