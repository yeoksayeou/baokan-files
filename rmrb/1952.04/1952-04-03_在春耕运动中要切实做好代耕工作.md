To Conscientiously Do the Work of Substitute Farming in the Spring Plowing Movement
Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Xiong Tianjing

    The substitute farming work in 1951 has already achieved great results. The fixed substitute farming system has been widely adopted in various regions. In the old liberated areas, the adoption of the fixed substitute farming system has generally reached over 80%. In Northeast China, North China, and other regions, mutual assistance in contracting farming or the signing of long-term contracts (two to three years) between families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and substitute farming households is developing; Shanxi Province has begun to study and trial run substitute farming cooperation methods in individual villages. In the newly liberated areas, fixed substitute farming is also being rapidly promoted. The amount of fertilizer applied to the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has mostly reached or approached the general level. Under the patriotic ideological education, the political consciousness of the broad masses has been greatly improved. They have realized that "doing a good job in substitute farming is a concrete task in resisting America and aiding Korea," and have successively incorporated doing a good job in substitute farming into patriotic covenants. They have generally done a meticulous job of cultivating the substitute farmed land, and the planting has been timely. Therefore, the yield of land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers lacking labor has significantly increased, and their living standards have generally risen. On the production front, many model families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and model substitute farmers have also emerged. This is a very favorable foundation for further improving substitute farming work in 1952.

    Based on the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Anti-Drought Movement" and "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952," as well as the experience of last year's inspections of preferential treatment work in various regions, we believe that the focus of substitute farming work in 1952 should be to strengthen the leadership of village (township) preferential treatment committees or substitute farming committees, formulate specific plans for substitute farming work, and implement them; universally promote the fixed substitute farming method; ensure the timely cultivation of land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and guarantee that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated; increase the yield per unit area, so that the yield of land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is not lower than that of the general public; educate families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to actively participate in production (especially in old base areas and disaster-stricken areas with more families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, more attention should be paid to helping and organizing them to carry out production for self-salvation).

    Spring plowing and sowing is a decisive link in the year's production. Whether our substitute farming work is done well or badly this year, spring plowing and sowing is a very important key. If we do not cultivate the substitute farmed land in a timely manner, or if we do not apply enough base fertilizer, it will seriously affect the harvest volume of the land. Therefore, we hope that all regions will pay attention to doing the following tasks in the current spring plowing movement:

    (1) Educate district and village (township) cadres and the broad masses, so that they realize that: doing a good job in substitute farming work is, on the one hand, an important task in consolidating the troops and strengthening the resistance against America and aiding Korea, and on the other hand, an important component of striving for a comprehensive agricultural harvest this year. Because in some areas, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers account for 10% to 20% of the total population, and in individual places, it reaches over 50%. Most of them lack labor. If their land is not cultivated well and the yield is low, it will not only affect the consolidation of the troops, but also directly affect the victorious completion of this year's agricultural production tasks.

    (2) Check the specific plans and arrangements for substitute farming work in villages (townships). Counties and districts should help village (township) cadres conduct household-by-household inspections and visits to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. If there is land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers that needs substitute farming that has not yet been arranged, it should be quickly fixed to households or substitute farming groups (or mutual aid teams), so that both the substitute farming households and the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers can prepare quickly. Otherwise, when sowing begins, random assignments and pulling will not only dissatisfy both the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the substitute farmers, but also delay the cultivation time, which will affect the harvest volume.

    (3) Help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers prepare for drought prevention and resistance. For the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, especially the land that needs substitute farming, according to the State Council's "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Anti-Drought Movement," help build farmland water conservancy, and urge substitute farming households (groups) to pay attention to spring moisture conservation on the substitute farmed land. For land that has been autumn plowed, timely harrow and harrow more after thawing; land that has not been plowed in autumn should be spring plowed as early as possible after thawing, plowing and harrowing at the same time. Areas that have recently rained should mobilize substitute farming households to quickly harrow the land to conserve moisture, in order to ensure that the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers can be sown in a timely manner.

    (4) Help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers solve specific problems such as fertilizer and seeds. Increasing fertilizer application is one of the most effective ways to increase the yield per unit area, and solving the problem of fertilizer needed for the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is closely related to the yield of their land. However, due to the lack of labor of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, accumulating fertilizer is relatively difficult; although some families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have accumulated some fertilizer after the calls and help from various regions last winter, it is estimated that the amount of fertilizer accumulated is still far from that of ordinary farmers. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to try to solve the problem themselves as much as possible (purchasing cake fertilizer, raising pigs, etc.), we should immediately check how much fertilizer families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have accumulated and whether it has been sent to the fields; we must first help them solve the fertilizer problem for spring crops. The problem of insufficient fertilizer for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers can be solved in various ways, such as mass donations, public toilet manure being used by families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, agricultural loans being given priority to them, cooperatives giving them priority when carrying out "deposit real and pre-sale," "spot sale," and "credit purchase" of fertilizer in disaster areas, etc., so as to ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is not lower than that of the general public. Secondly, help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers solve the problem of insufficient seeds, and strive to sow better seeds on the substitute farmed land; for those who lack seeds, the masses can be mobilized to help each other solve the problem, or the substitute farming households and substitute farming groups can advance the seeds first and repay them after the autumn harvest. It is best for all regions to issue some preferential treatment grain during the spring planting period to solve the problem of insufficient seeds for individual families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who are indeed poor. In addition, we should also help them solve some specific difficulties in agricultural tools and agricultural technology as much as possible.

    Finally, it should also be noted that we should educate families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to participate in production, mobilize them to participate in the mass movement for drought prevention and resistance that is being carried out nationwide, and call on them to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory. Only by everyone working together and participating in the struggle for production and drought prevention can we overcome all possible disasters and ensure a bumper harvest on our own land.

    The time for spring plowing and sowing has arrived, and a large-scale spring plowing movement is underway. The people's governments of various regions, especially the civil affairs departments, must seize the time, quickly help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers solve some specific problems in spring plowing, and do a good job in ideological mobilization and organizational preparation for substitute farming work, to ensure that all the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is sown in a timely manner and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

    在春耕运动中要切实做好代耕工作
    中央内务部优抚司司长　熊天荆
    一九五一年的代耕工作，已经做出了很大的成绩。固定代耕制已为各地普遍采用。老解放区采用固定代耕制的一般已达百分之八十以上。在东北、华北等地正在发展着互助包耕或烈属、军属与代耕户订立长期合同（二年至三年）的代耕方式；山西省在个别村庄开始研究试办代耕合作的办法。在新解放区，固定代耕也在迅速推广。烈属、军属土地的施肥量大部达到或接近了一般的水平。广大群众在爱国主义思想教育下，政治觉悟已大大提高，他们已认识到“做好代耕工作就是抗美援朝的一项具体工作”，纷纷把做好代耕工作订入爱国公约，对代耕的土地一般的作到了精耕细作，耕种及时。因此，缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属的土地产量显著地提高了，他们的生活水平已普遍上升。在生产战线上，还涌现了不少的烈属、军属生产模范和代耕模范。这是一九五二年进一步做好代耕工作的极有利的基础。
    根据中央人民政府政务院“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”和“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”以及去年各地优抚工作检查的经验，我们认为一九五二年代耕工作的重点应该是加强村（乡）优抚委员会或代耕委员会的领导，订出代耕工作的具体计划，并贯彻执行；普遍推行固定代耕方式；要作到烈属、军属土地的及时耕种，保证不荒芜一亩土地；提高单位面积产量，使烈属、军属的土地产量不低于一般群众；教育烈属、军属积极参加生产（特别在烈属、军属较多的老根据地和遭灾地区，更应注意帮助和组织他们进行生产自救）。
    春耕播种是全年生产中的一个决定环节。我们今年代耕工作做得好做得坏，春耕播种是一个极重要的关键。如果我们对代耕土地耕种不及时，或基肥施的不足，将会严重地影响到土地的收获量。因此，希望各地在当前的春耕运动中注意做好以下几项工作：
    （一）教育区、村（乡）干部和广大群众，使他们认识到：做好代耕工作，一方面是巩固部队，加强抗美援朝的一项重要工作，同时也是争取今年农业全面丰收的重要组成部分。因为有些地区的烈属、军属占总人口的百分之十到百分之二十，有个别地方达到百分之五十以上。他们中间的大部分是缺乏劳动力的。如果他们的土地耕种不好，产量低，不但影响部队的巩固，而且会直接影响到今年农业生产任务的胜利完成。
    （二）检查村（乡）代耕工作的具体计划和布置情况。县和区应该帮助村（乡）干部对烈属、军属进行逐户的检查、访问。如果有烈属、军属需要代耕的土地还没有布置好的，要很快地固定到户或代耕组（或互助组），以便使代耕户和烈属、军属都可以速作准备。不然，播种开始了，临时乱派乱拉，不仅使烈属、军属和代耕人都不满意，而且耽误了耕种时间，将影响收获量。
    （三）帮助烈属、军属做好防旱抗旱的准备工作。对烈属、军属的土地，特别是需要代耕的土地，要根据政务院“关于大力开展群众性防旱、抗旱运动的决定”，帮助兴修农田水利，督促代耕户（组）对代耕土地注意春季保墒。已秋耕的土地，在解冻后要及时细耙多耙；去秋未耕土地应在解冻后及早春耕，随耕随耙。最近已落雨的地区要动员代耕户迅速耙地保墒，以保证烈属、军属的土地能够及时播种。
    （四）帮助烈属、军属解决肥料种籽等具体问题。增施肥料是提高单位面积产量的最有效的办法之一，烈属、军属土地所需肥料问题的解决，对他们的土地产量关系很密切。但是，由于烈属、军属缺乏劳动力，积肥比较困难；去冬虽然经过各地的号召和帮助，有些烈属、军属已积下了一些肥料，但估计比一般农民的积肥量还是差得很远的。因此，我们除了动员烈属、军属尽可能自己设法解决（购买饼肥、养猪等）外，应对烈属、军属已积的肥料多少和是否已送到地里，马上进行检查；首先要帮助他们解决春种作物的用肥问题。烈属、军属肥料不够的问题，可用各种办法解决，如群众捐助、公共厕所的粪归烈属、军属使用，农业贷款优先贷给、合作社进行“存实预售”“现售”和灾区“赊购”肥料时，对他们优先照顾等，要作到烈属、军属的土地施肥量不低于一般群众。其次是帮助烈属、军属解决种籽不足的问题，争取作到代耕土地播种较优良的种籽；对缺乏种籽的，可以发动群众互助解决，或由代耕户、代耕组先行垫借，秋收补还。各地最好能在春种期间发放一部分优抚粮，以解决个别确实贫苦的烈属、军属种籽不足的问题。此外，对农具及农业技术上的一些具体困难，我们也要尽可能帮助他们解决。
    最后还应注意，教育烈属、军属参加生产，动员他们参加全国正在进行的防旱抗旱的群众运动，号召他们发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。大家一齐动手参加生产防旱斗争，才能战胜一切可能遇到的灾害，保证自己土地的丰收。
    春耕播种时间已经到来了，大规模的春耕运动正在展开，各地的人民政府特别是民政部门必须抓紧时间，迅速帮助烈属、军属解决春耕中的一些具体问题，做好代耕工作的思想动员和组织上的准备工作，保证烈属、军属的全部土地作到及时播种，打下今年丰收的基础。
