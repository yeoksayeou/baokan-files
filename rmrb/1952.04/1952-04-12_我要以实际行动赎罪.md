I Want to Redeem Myself with Practical Actions
Zuo Lincheng
I am a major embezzler, working as an assistant engineer in the Design Department of the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government. I embezzled and accepted bribes totaling 142.1 million yuan in three different locations, causing a direct loss of 1.1 billion yuan to state property. In the great "Three-Anti" movement, I confessed my crimes and bowed my head to the people to admit my guilt. I am determined to turn over a new leaf and redeem myself through meritorious service.

At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" movement, I was working in the Northeast. I appeared calm on the surface, but I was very afraid inside. I didn't know how the government would deal with an embezzler like me. Also, I thought my methods of embezzlement and bribery were so clever that others wouldn't easily discover them, so I didn't want to confess. To be "safe," I even formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with a奸商 (cunning merchant). After the movement started, the heads of the organization made mobilization reports, explained the policies of the Party and the government, and pointed out that those who confessed would be treated leniently. But I thought this was just to "trick" embezzlers into giving "confessions." I didn't understand that the Communist Party and the People's Government were there to cure the illness and save the person, so I dared not confess. I went to the cunning merchant and told him not to say anything. Seeing that I was afraid, the cunning merchant scared me even more: "If you tell, you'll be shot. It's better to keep quiet and muddle through." I also thought the same way. At this time, the movement unfolded, with meetings day and night, and strong firepower. Some small embezzlers confessed, and I was also shaken a little. But I felt my problem was big, and if I told, I would be shot, or at least be jailed for ten years. Besides, my comrades used to think highly of me, how could I face them if I confessed? In short, I had many concerns. I was lost in thought all day long, unable to eat or sleep in peace, and I couldn't even appear calm on the surface. At this time, the "Three-Anti" movement had entered its climax, but I was still dragging my feet and not confessing.

After January 20th, my embezzlement in Beijing was reported, and I began to panic a little. But because the amount wasn't large, only more than 7 million yuan, and to cover up the big problem in the Northeast, I confessed the embezzlement in Beijing. At first, I said it was 1.3 million yuan, then I added it to 3.9 million yuan, deceiving the government and the masses. At this time, the leading comrades repeatedly explained the policy, and I began to realize that the government was really trying to save us sinners. But I was still very worried, dared not say, and didn't want to say. At this time, my wife wrote to me from Beijing, asking me to confess my problems. On the one hand, I perfunctorily replied to her, and on the other hand, I tried to get information from the leading comrades, trying to find out how long the "Three-Anti" movement would last. I failed on both sides: my wife sent me a letter almost every day, reasoning with me and urging me to confess; the leading comrades expressed their determination—they would not stop until the embezzlers were thoroughly eliminated. I was afraid, so I ran to the cunning merchant to test the waters. The cunning merchant said, "Look, I have a lot of wives and children, how can I talk!" When I heard this, I felt a little relieved, thinking that the "offensive and defensive alliance" was secure. So I wrote back to my wife, playing rogue tactics. I said, "If you say anything, we'll break up!" Her reply surprised me. Not only was she not intimidated, but she sternly told me to confess quickly. On January 30th, my wife wrote again, saying that if I didn't confess, she would report me. When I saw that I couldn't hold on any longer, I had to say a little about the small problems she knew. That day, I found the cunning merchant and agreed to confess 30 million yuan of embezzlement and bribery. The big problems and the shares were not mentioned at all. That night, I confessed a little. The organization expressed its belief in me, and on February 3rd, it announced that I would be exempted from criminal punishment. At that time, I felt happy, thinking that I could muddle through. But at the same time, I carried another burden: I had deceived the organization, and I felt even more uneasy. I thought, if my other problems were discovered, what would the organization do to me? My thoughts were extremely confused, and my actions were even more restless. When I saw the news of the public trial of major embezzlers in Beijing on February 1st in the Northeast, I had not yet awakened (I thought that was just putting on a show). However, the organization quickly grasped the materials of my embezzlement and bribery, and on February 6th, I was suspended from my job for reflection. I knew things were serious. On February 7th, the Ministry of Communications sent two more comrades to urge me to reflect. They repeatedly pointed out the two paths for embezzlers, hoping that I could strive to take the path of voluntary confession. Under these circumstances, I knew that resisting the movement was impossible, so I dispelled all concerns and thoroughly confessed my crimes.

When I had just been transferred back to Beijing from the Northeast, I was still uneasy. I knew that the Communist Party and the People's Government were good, but how would they deal with an embezzler like me? I was afraid of being severely punished.

At the confession and denunciation meeting held by the Ministry of Communications on March 10th, I confessed all my embezzlement and bribery crimes, and I also denounced other embezzlers and cunning merchants. On the spot, Minister Zhang Bojun, in accordance with the central government's policy, announced that he would recommend that the government impose a suspended sentence on me after sentencing me to imprisonment, allowing me to redeem myself through meritorious service. After hearing this, I was truly moved and ashamed. I never dreamed that a person like me with such heinous crimes could receive such lenient treatment from the government and the people. When I returned to my own team, I truly felt the warmth of a revolutionary family. I experienced the brightness and happiness of the new society, and I deeply hated the despicable and shameful behavior of my past.

I know that if you borrow money from someone, you have to return it. I should repay the property of the state and the people that I stole. Therefore, I am determined to find a way to return the stolen money as soon as possible. When I confessed at the Ministry of Communications meeting, I returned eight gold ingots and 2.3 million yuan in RMB that the cunning merchant had bribed me with. The money I embezzled and accepted as bribes and deposited with the merchant has been used to write an IOU to the state. Now, in addition to the returned stolen money, I still owe 33.2 million yuan. I have decided to use my spare time to compile books, design, and other methods to fully repay the debt within two years. At the same time, I guarantee that in the projects I handle in the future, I will definitely calculate carefully and never allow any embezzlement or waste to occur. If I see any illegal phenomena such as embezzlement, waste, or shoddy work in the projects I see, I will definitely report them and fight resolutely against the illegal elements. The great "Three-Anti" movement has educated me and made me determined to serve the people. In the future, I will repay the people's leniency and the Communist Party's salvation with practical actions of hard work.

    我要以实际行动赎罪
    左林丞
    我是个大贪污犯，在中央人民政府交通部公路总局设计处任帮工程师。我连续在三个地方贪污、受贿一亿四千二百一十万元，使国家财产直接损失十一亿元。在伟大的“三反”运动中，我坦白了我的罪行，向人民低头认罪。我决心痛改前非，戴罪立功。
    “三反”运动开始时，我在东北工作。我表面上装得很镇静，但内心非常恐惧。我不知道政府对于像我这样的贪污分子会如何处理。又想到自己贪污受贿的方式很妙，别人不易发觉，因而不想坦白。为了“保险”，我更和奸商订了“攻守同盟”。运动开始后，机关首长作了动员报告，交代了党和政府的政策，指明坦白者宽大处理。但我认为这只是为了“骗”贪污分子的“口供”，我更不了解共产党和人民政府是治病救人的，因此不敢坦白。我又去奸商那里，叫他不要说。奸商看我害怕，就越发吓唬我：“你说了就得枪毙，不如不说混过去。”我也是这种想法。这时运动展开了，白天、黑夜开会，火力很强。有些小贪污分子坦白了，我也震动了一下。但我觉得自己的问题大，说了要枪毙，往好里想，也要坐十年监。再说，以前同志们看得起我，如果坦白了，怎样做人呢？总之顾虑很多。一天到晚胡思乱想，吃饭睡觉都不安心，弄得表面上都不能镇静了。这时“三反”运动已进入高潮，我却还硬拖着，一直不坦白。
    一月二十日以后，我在北京的贪污行为被人检举了，我开始有点恐慌。但因数字不大，只七百多万元，而且为了掩盖在东北的大问题，我便把在北京的贪污行为说了出来。起先说一百三十万元，后来添到三百九十万元，欺骗政府和群众。这时，领导同志再三交代政策，我开始认识到政府是真正为了挽救我们这些罪人的。但我还是顾虑很大，不敢说，不想说。这时，我的爱人从北京来信，要我交代问题。我一方面敷衍她，一方面向领导同志摸底，探听“三反”运动还要搞多久。两方面我都失败了：我的爱人差不多每天给我一封信，讲道理，督促我坦白；领导同志表示了决心——不彻底肃清贪污分子，决不收兵。我怕起来，于是跑到奸商那里，试试口气。奸商说：“你看，我老婆孩子一大堆，怎么能说！”我一听，安心了些，认为“攻守同盟”有把握。于是我给我爱人写回信，大耍流氓手段。我说：“如果你说了，我们就分手！”她的回信却使我惊异，她不但没被吓倒，反而严厉地要我赶快坦白。一月三十日，我爱人又来信，说我若再不坦白，她就检举我。我一看撑不住了，只好说一点她知道的小问题。当天找到奸商，商量好坦白三千万元的贪污受贿行为。大的和入股的问题，一概不谈。当晚，我坦白了一下。组织上表示相信我，二月三日便宣布我免予刑事处分。当时我感到高兴，觉得这样可以混过去了。但同时又背上另一个包袱：我欺骗了组织，我心里更感不安。我更想到如果我的其他问题被发现了，组织上将对我怎么办？我思想混乱极了，行动更不安。我在东北看到二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会的消息，还没有清醒过来（我认为那是挑起幌子作“戏”）。但是，组织上很快地便掌握了我的贪污受贿的材料，在二月六日让我停职反省。我知道事情是严重了。二月七日，交通部又派来两位同志督促我反省。他们又再三向我指明贪污分子的两条道路，希望我能争取走自动坦白的道路。在这种情况下，我知道抗拒运动是不行的，便打消一切顾虑，彻底坦白了我的罪行。
    从东北刚调回北京时，我还放心不下。我知道共产党和人民政府好，但对我这样的贪污分子怎样处理呢？我怕受到严厉的处分。
    在三月十日交通部召开的检举坦白大会上，我又交代了我的全部贪污、受贿罪行，并检举了其他贪污分子和奸商。当场章伯钧部长根据中央的政策，宣布建议政府在判处我徒刑以后，缓期执行，准许我戴罪立功。我听了以后，真是又感动，又惭愧。我这种罪大恶极的人能得到政府和人民如此宽大的处理，真是以前梦想不到的。当我回到自己队伍的时候，我真正感到革命家庭的温暖。我体会到新社会的光明和幸福，深恨自己以前行为的卑鄙可耻。
    我知道，平常借了人家的钱也要归还，我盗窃了国家人民的财产更应当偿还。所以我决心尽早想法倒出赃款。我在交通部大会坦白时，当场把奸商向我行贿的八个金元宝及人民币二百三十万元退了出来。我贪污受贿存在商人手里的钱，已让那个商人向国家写了欠条。现在，除已退还的赃款外，还欠三千三百二十万元没有还清。我决定在两年之内用业余时间编译书籍、设计等办法，完全偿清欠款。同时，我保证今后在所经手的工程中，一定精打细算，决不使它发生一点贪污、浪费现象。在我看到的工程中，如发现有贪污、浪费或偷工减料等违法现象，我一定检举，和违法分子做坚决斗争。伟大的“三反”运动教育了我，使我下定了为人民服务的决心。今后我将以努力工作的实际行动，来报答人民对我的宽大，报答共产党对我的挽救。
