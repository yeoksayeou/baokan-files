    Beijing Qianmen Outer West Station and the Eighth District People's Government
    Some Cadres Actually Fail to Assist in Tax Collection Work
    To the Editor: The personnel at Beijing Qianmen Outer West Station have consistently failed to assist in tax collection work. At other stations, passengers must have their goods stamped by the tax bureau before they can be shipped or retrieved. However, the personnel at West Station not only do not assist, but also use the excuse of "affecting railway operations" to forbid tax bureau personnel from conducting inspections within the station. On April 5th, when the unloading location was changed due to some reason, the tax collection office was not notified. Fortunately, cadres from the tax collection office learned about this from the dockworkers, thus preventing a tax evasion incident. We believe that the responsible personnel at Qianmen Outer West Station should correct this attitude. In addition, comrades Cao and Liang from the Beijing Eighth District People's Government purchased four carts of sorghum stalks at the Xian Nong Tan Market, and did not see formal receipts—uniform shipping invoices. They disbursed the payment based solely on the cart drivers' delivery slips, causing the three vendors to leave without paying taxes at the tax collection office. When the tax collection office contacted the district government, Section Chief Xing of the district's Construction Section responded with an extremely irresponsible attitude. In the midst of the vigorous "Five-Anti" campaign, all parts of the country have attached greater importance to tax collection work, but the cadres in this district have not received the education they deserve. We believe that the district People's Government should seriously investigate this tax evasion case and should be responsible for recovering the taxes. Comrades Cao and Liang, and Section Chief Xing, should make a profound self-criticism on this matter and publish it in the newspaper to educate government cadres who do not value tax collection.

### 北京前门外西站和八区人民政府  某些干部竟不协助税收工作

    北京前门外西站和八区人民政府
    某些干部竟不协助税收工作
    编辑同志：北京前门外西车站人员一贯不协助税收工作。在别的车站，旅客托运或提取货物时，都要先经税局盖章；但西车站人员，不但不加协助，反而藉口“影响铁路业务”，不准许税局人员在站内稽查。四月五日，该站因故改换卸货地点时，也不通知稽征所。幸亏稽征所的干部从搬运工人口中得知此事，才避免了漏税事故的发生。我们认为前门外西车站负责人员应该纠正这种态度。又，北京八区人民政府曹、梁二同志曾到先农坛市场买滑秸四车，没有见到正式单据——统一发货票，只凭车夫的送货单就开支了货款，致使三个卖货的人不到稽征所完税便自行走散。稽征所向该区政府联系时，该区建设科邢科长反以极不负责任的态度对待。在轰轰烈烈的“五反”运动中，全国各地都对税收工作更加重视，但该区干部却没有受到应有的教育。我们认为该区人民政府应该认真检查这一逃税案，并应负追缴责任。该区曹、梁二同志及邢科长，应就此事作深刻检讨，在报上公布，以教育不重视税收的机关干部。
