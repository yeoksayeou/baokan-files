Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th - The British government of Hong Kong is illegally trying our country's journalists. The British government of Hong Kong arrested and charged Fei Yimin, Mei Wending, Li Zongying, Li Zisong, and other ten people who were the owners, printers, publishers, and editors of the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post on March 21st and 24th. The ten compatriots who were unreasonably charged were temporarily released on "bail" after paying bail of 10,000 to 20,000 Hong Kong dollars. Beginning on April 16th, the British government of Hong Kong conducted illegal trials of Fei Yimin, Li Zongying, and Bao Lichu of the Ta Kung Pao. The "charges" it announced during the trial were: "Publishing seditious words involving the government of this colony (i.e., the British government of Hong Kong), violating Section 4, Paragraph 1 (C) of the Sedition Ordinance." The so-called "seditious words" of the British government of Hong Kong are the short commentary in the People's Daily in Beijing on March 5th entitled "Protest British Imperialism's Killing of Our Country's Residents in Hong Kong" which was reprinted by Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post.

The British government of Hong Kong's shameless conspiracy to continue persecuting patriotic Chinese people was exposed on the spot by the Ta Kung Pao's defense lawyer during the "trial" from the 16th to the 18th. He sternly pointed out that these arrests and charges were illegal. This illegal "trial" has not yet concluded, and will continue again on the 21st.

The people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City express extreme indignation at this reactionary measure of the British government of Hong Kong, and will fully support the persecuted patriotic journalists.

    香港英政府竟非法审讯我国新闻工作者
    我国人民对英政府这一反动措施极表愤怒
    【新华社广州二十日电】香港英国政府非法审讯我国新闻工作者。香港英国政府曾在三月二十一日和二十四日逮捕并控告香港大公报、文汇报和新晚报的所有人、督印人、承印人和编辑费彝民、梅文鼎、李宗瀛、李子诵等十人。被无理控告的十位同胞在缴纳了港币一万元到二万元的保金后，才暂获出外“候审”。四月十六日开始，香港英国政府即向大公报人员费彝民、李宗瀛和鲍立初三人进行了非法审讯。它在审讯中宣布的“控词”是：“刊载涉及本殖民地政府（按即香港英国政府）的煽动性文字，违犯煽动条例第四段第一节（C）项的规定”。香港英国政府的所谓“煽动性文字”，就是大公报、文汇报、新晚报在三月五日转载的北京人民日报题为“抗议英帝国主义捕杀香港的我国居民”的短评。
    香港英国政府继续迫害中国爱国人民的无耻阴谋，在十六日到十八日的“审讯”中，已被大公报的辩护律师当场予以揭穿。他严厉指出：这种逮捕和控告都是非法的。这个非法的“审讯”迄无结果，二十一日将再行继续。
    广东省、广州市人民对于香港英国政府这一反动措施，极表愤怒，并将全力支援被迫害的爱国新闻工作者。
