Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 25th: The American aggressors, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gang special agents, are continuously carrying out bloody massacres of our captured personnel, attempting to carry out their conspiracy of forcibly detaining our captured personnel under the guise of "voluntary repatriation."

With the assistance of the Chiang-Rhee bandit gangs, the American aggressor authorities in Korea employed despicable means such as forcing our captured personnel to write blood letters and tattooing characters on their bodies, forcibly detaining our captured personnel. When these despicable means failed, the American aggressor authorities in Korea barbarously massacred our captured personnel, attempting to destroy their indomitable will to demand repatriation to their motherland. The two tragic incidents on Geoje Island, revealed by the U.S. side itself, are clear evidence. On February 18th, a large number of American troops surrounded more than 5,000 of our captured personnel detained in the 62nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. The U.S. personnel despicably conducted "individual interrogations" of our captured personnel, forcibly implementing "screening." This illegal measure was rejected by our captured personnel. The enraged American aggressors actually carried out a collective massacre of them. When the bloodstains of this massacre had not yet dried, the American aggressors carried out a second massacre of our captured personnel at the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp on March 13th for the same purpose. According to U.S. statistics, they killed 87 and wounded 165 of our captured personnel in the two tragic incidents. These collective massacre incidents are inseparable from the criminal activities of the Chiang-Rhee bandit gang special agents. For example, the Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on February 23rd revealed that so-called "translators" participated in the first massacre; and according to the Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on March 15th, "seven or eight armed South Koreans" and "fifty or sixty armed soldiers of the Republic of Korea" were accomplices in the second massacre.

In the bloody massacres, our captured personnel demonstrated their heroic and unyielding determination to oppose the conspiracy of "voluntary repatriation." Dodd, the officer in charge of the American Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, said in distress shortly after the first massacre: During the tragedy, "the detainees, who outwardly showed loyalty to the Republic of Korea, suddenly changed into waving flags and shouting communist slogans" (United Press dispatch from Geoje Island, February 24th).

When writing blood letters, forcibly tattooing characters, and even collective massacres failed to work, the American aggressors openly adopted another cunning measure: further isolating our captured personnel and continuing to forcibly conduct "screening." According to an announcement by the U.S. military authorities in Korea on April 16th, it is transporting some of our captured personnel from Geoje Island to "other smaller prisoner-of-war camps in other parts of South Korea." The U.S. communiqué brazenly stated that this would "improve the discipline and control of the recalcitrant Communist agitators among the prisoners of war." These brutal measures of intensified persecution did not start now. As early as January 20th, a United Press dispatch from Geoje Island revealed such an incident: in the "officers' detention camp," a "outspoken communist" was "hung up and beaten unconscious" by the U.S.-Chiang bandit gang. The next day, "he and fifteen other companions" were transferred to another detention location. United Press said: "That was prepared especially for some stubborn communists." The American aggressors' relocation of our captured personnel's detention locations this time is a large-scale re-enactment of the above-mentioned brutal incident. It attempts to use this method to continue to "screen" our captured personnel, clearing the way for the conspiracy plan of forcibly "voluntary repatriation." The Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on April 16th admitted that "the Allied forces' launch of this new action may be aimed at the Panmunjom armistice talks," "because increasing the number of prisoner-of-war camps makes it easier to screen a large number of prisoners."

The will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation to their motherland is unwavering. Any bloody measures by the American aggressors attempting to forcibly "voluntary repatriation" are futile. The American aggressors must stop their bloody atrocities of insulting, persecuting, and massacring our captured personnel. If the American aggressors do not know how to repent, they will inevitably be severely sanctioned by the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world.

### 美方调动我方被俘人员的拘留地点  妄图强行其“自愿遣返”的血腥措施

    美方调动我方被俘人员的拘留地点
    妄图强行其“自愿遣返”的血腥措施
    【新华社开城二十五日电】美国侵略者勾结蒋介石和李承晚匪帮特务分子，不断地对我方被俘人员进行血腥的屠杀，妄图借此遂行其美其名为“自愿遣返”、而实际上是强行扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。
    美国侵朝当局曾在蒋李匪帮的协助下，施用了强迫我方被俘人员写血书和刺字等等卑鄙手段，强行扣留我方被俘人员。当这些卑鄙手段失败之后，美国侵朝当局就野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员企图这样来摧毁他们要求遣返祖国的不可屈服的意志。美方自己所透露出来的巨济岛的两次惨案，就是明证。二月十八日，大批美军包围了被拘禁在巨济岛第六十二号俘虏营中的我方被俘人员五千多人。美方人员卑鄙地对我方被俘人员进行“个别询问”，强迫实行“甄别”。这一非法的措施遭到了我方被俘人员的拒绝。恼羞成怒的美国侵略者竟对他们实行集体屠杀。当这一次大屠杀的血迹还没有干的时候，美国侵略者又为同样的目的于三月十三日在巨济岛俘虏营对我方被俘人员进行了第二次的大屠杀。根据美方的统计，他们在两次惨案中共杀死我方被俘人员八十七人，打伤一百六十五人。这些集体屠杀的惨案，是和蒋李匪帮特务分子的罪恶活动分不开的。例如，美联社巨济岛二月二十三日电透露，在第一次大屠杀中，有所谓“翻译员”参与其事；又据美联社巨济岛三月十五日电透露，“七八个带武装的南朝鲜人”和“五六十个带武装的大韩民国的兵士”，是第二次大屠杀的帮凶。
    在血腥的屠杀中，我方被俘人员表现了他们英勇不屈地反对“自愿遣返”的阴谋的坚决意志。美国巨济岛俘虏营的负责官员杜德，在第一次大屠杀发生之后不久曾苦恼地说：在惨案发生时，“被拘者从表面上表示效忠大韩民国，一变而为摇旗呐喊的共产党”（合众社巨济岛二月二十四日电）。
    在写血书、强迫刺字以至集体屠杀都不能奏效时，美国侵略者又在公开地采取另外一种诡计多端的措施：更加严密地隔绝我方被俘人员，继续强迫进行“甄别”。据侵朝美军当局在四月十六日宣布，它正在把一部分我方的被俘人员从巨济岛运往“南朝鲜其他地方的其他较小的俘虏营中”。美方的公报肆无忌惮地说：这样会“改进战俘间刁悍的共产党鼓动者的纪律及管制”。这类加紧迫害的残暴措施，并不是从现在开始的。早在一月二十日，合众社从巨济岛拍发的电讯就曾透露了这样的一个事例：在“军官的拘留营”内，一个“说话直率的共产党人”被美蒋匪帮“吊起来，打得人事不知”。第二天，“他和另外十五名同伴”就被调到另外一个拘留地点去了。合众社说：“那是专为一些顽固不化的共产党人预备的”。美国侵略者这次重新调动我方被俘人员的拘留地点，就是上述残暴的事例的大规模重演。它妄图利用这种方法来继续对我方被俘人员进行“甄别”，为强行“自愿遣返”的阴谋计划扫清道路。美联社汉城四月十六日电供认，“联军开始这一新的行动可能是着眼于板门店停战谈判”，“因为增加一些俘虏营就更容易甄别大批的俘虏”。
    我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的意志是坚定不移的。美国侵略者任何妄图强行“自愿遣返”的血腥措施，都是枉费心机的。美国侵略者必须停止它的侮辱、迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行。美国侵略者如果不知悔祸，必然要遭到朝中人民和全世界人民的严厉的制裁。
