Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 14th: The US New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on April 8th, exposing the clumsy lies used by the US aggressors to cover up their crimes of conducting germ warfare.

The editorial mentioned that the US Department of Defense, through a so-called "expert," said in the "New York Times" on April 3rd that the photos published in Chinese newspapers showed "leaflet bombs," not germ bombs. The Pentagon (referring to the US Department of Defense) hopes that people will believe that germs cannot be dropped using "leaflet bombs."

The editorial said: "However, the 'New York Times' and the Pentagon are today, in front of the whole country, deceivers of American public opinion and world opinion." The editorial cited an Associated Press report from April 5, 1952, regarding a conversation by Representative Sykes, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee, as proof. Sykes told reporters after listening to the secret testimony of Brigadier General Creasy, commander of the US Chemical Corps: "He (referring to Creasy) said that the tools for spreading germs in enemy territory are simple, and this equipment is now 'fully stocked by the troops... such as the containers currently used to drop propaganda leaflets.'" The editorial pointed out: This conversation "proves that the 'New York Times' and its Pentagon 'expert' are engaging in political deception of the American people."

    美国“工人日报”发表社论指出
    美国侵略者进行欺骗宣传企图掩饰细菌战罪恶行为
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】美国纽约“工人日报”于四月八日发表社论，揭露美国侵略者企图用来掩盖它进行细菌战的罪行的拙劣谎话。
    社论提到美国国防部曾通过一个所谓“专家”在四月三日的“纽约时报”上说：中国报纸上刊载的照片所显示的是“传单炸弹”，而不是细菌炸弹。五角大楼（按指美国国防部）希望人民相信细菌是不能用“传单炸弹”来投掷的。
    社论说：“但是，‘纽约时报’和五角大楼今天在全国的面前是美国人民舆论和世界舆论的欺骗者”。社论引述一九五二年四月五日美联社报道众议院拨款小组委员会主席赛克斯的谈话作为证明。赛克斯在听取了美国化学兵团司令布伦的秘密作证后对报界说：“他（指布伦）说，在敌人领土上散播细菌的工具是简单的，这种装备现在部队‘已有充分储存……如目前用以投掷宣传传单的容器’。”社论指出：这个谈话“证明了‘纽约时报’及其五角大楼‘专家’是在对美国人民作政治欺骗”。
