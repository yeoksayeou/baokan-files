Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests:

The International Economic Conference is a grand gathering of industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, cooperative workers, trade union workers, and economists from all over the world. The Chinese delegation is very pleased to attend. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the friends of the International Economic Conference Preparatory Committee, especially the friends of the Soviet Preparatory Committee, for their preparatory work in making such a gathering from all sides possible in Moscow.

Although the representatives of the International Economic Conference come from countries with different political and socio-economic systems, and hold various different views and beliefs, they share a common hope for promoting the peaceful cooperation and development between countries. After the conference widely exchanges opinions and conducts business contacts, we believe that it will certainly find a possible way for the world's human beings to promote trade and other economic relations between countries under world peace, so as to improve the living conditions of the people. Therefore, the people all over the world and the public opinions of all countries place earnest expectations on the conference. We believe that through the concerted efforts of all of you, we will surely be able to successfully complete this task.

I. Promoting International Trade and Developing International Economic Relations under Peaceful Conditions to Improve the Living Conditions of the People of the World

At present, what industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, cooperative workers, trade union workers, economists, and the broad masses of people all over the world are most concerned about is how to promote international trade, develop international economic relations, so as to improve the living conditions of the people of all countries. The Chinese people have made many years of efforts in this regard, and we are willing to provide our experience and opinions to all of you for reference.

The Chinese people have deeply felt the harm of war to the economy. As everyone knows, the Second World War caused serious damage to the economies of various countries. As everyone knows, the Second World War started in China. The invasion of Northeast China by Japanese imperialism in 1931 triggered the prelude to the Second World War. The Chinese people experienced the longest time of war during the Second World War. When the Second World War came to an end, China suffered another four years of civil war due to the anti-people war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group with the support of external forces. The Chinese economy suffered severe damage in the war. During the war, industrial and commercial enterprises went bankrupt one after another, a large number of workers and intellectuals became unemployed, a large number of farmers and handicraftsmen went bankrupt, and the living standards of the people were extremely reduced. The destruction of the economy and the reduction of the living standards of the people brought about by war have been repeatedly proven by history. However, before the wounds of the Second World War have been healed, some countries are trying to seek a way out of the economic crisis by expanding armaments and preparing for war. Expanding armaments and preparing for war will inevitably expand the government's military budget and increase the burden on the people. At the same time, expanding the production of military industry will reduce the production of civilian industry, and as a result, it will force the purchasing power of the people to decrease, industrial and commercial enterprises will stop work and reduce production, the number of unemployed people will increase day by day, and the living standards of the people will decline day by day. Expanding armaments and preparing for war not only did not rescue these countries from the economic crisis, but also plunged these countries into a deeper economic crisis.

The United States government attempts to rely on the blockade and embargo against the Soviet Union, China and the people's democracies to achieve the goal of monopolizing the world market and缓和缓和the arrival of its own economic crisis. But to apply this attempt to the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies with a population of more than 800 million and vast land, everyone knows that this is an impossible fantasy, and in fact it only facilitates the U.S. government to use this pretext to carry out the activities of monopolizing raw material and commodity markets. However, many countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas have had decades or even hundreds of years of international trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies. Once exchanges are prohibited, it will inevitably increase their own difficulties. For example, European and American industrialists and businessmen have increased the difficulty of importing soybeans, bristles, tung oil, and egg products from China; Japanese industrialists and businessmen have increased the difficulty of importing cheap coal, salt, soybeans and other commodities from China; Asian industrialists and businessmen have increased the difficulty of importing food, soybeans and light industrial products from China; and the U.S. government is taking advantage of their difficulties to strengthen its control over them. At the same time, the blockade and embargo have also made industrialists and businessmen in many countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas lose the vast market for industrial equipment, chemical raw materials, industrial products, industrial raw materials, and agricultural products; and the U.S. government is taking advantage of their difficulties to wantonly suppress the purchase price. The U.S. government originally attempted to pass on the economic crisis to others through this measure, but in fact its own domestic civilian industrial production has also been greatly reduced, and military industrial production has been infinitely expanded. Therefore, it has not been able to缓和the arrival of its economic crisis, but has only made more countries sink into a deeper economic crisis. Therefore, the absurd and stupid blockade and embargo have been opposed by the people all over the world and the governments of many countries from the very beginning, and are doomed to a complete failure.

We believe that it is necessary to promote international trade and develop international economic relations under the condition of world peace, so as to improve the living conditions of the people of the world. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China clearly announced to the governments of all countries on the day of the government's establishment on October 1, 1949: "This government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that is willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." We have always supported lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates the policy of "restoring and developing commercial trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." We adopt a positive policy of restoring and developing economic relations with various countries. We are willing to restore and develop commercial trade relations with the governments and peoples of all countries, regardless of their beliefs, political systems, and socio-economic organizations, as long as it is on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We firmly believe that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully and develop international economic relations. We believe that the development of international economic relations must be built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and must respect each other's political independence, trade autonomy, and the interests of economic development; and oppose interfering in each other's sovereignty and implementing policies of dumping, monopoly, and annexation. This kind of equal and mutually beneficial international trade is in line with the interests of the Chinese people, and it is also in line with the interests of the people of the world. We believe that at present, only by developing international economic relations under the conditions of world peace, lifting the blockade and embargo, and fully developing international trade can we help those countries with economic crises to get out of the crisis, restore the production of peaceful industry, and gradually improve the living conditions of the people there. These principles are all very clear.

II. The Achievements of China's Economic Construction in the Past Two Years Have Planned a Grand Prospect for the Development of International Economic Relations

The Chinese people not only have the desire to develop international economic relations under peaceful conditions, but also have greatly enhanced China's strength to develop economic relations with various countries and planned a grand prospect for the development of China's international trade due to the achievements of China's economic construction in the past two years.

The corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government and the civil war it waged with the assistance of the U.S. government brought the Chinese economy to the brink of collapse. In the war, more than half of the railways and highways were damaged, agricultural production decreased to 75% of that before the war, heavy industry output was only equivalent to 30% of the highest year in history, and light industry output was only equivalent to 70%. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government had maintained a huge military budget, resulting in serious inflation. On the eve of its collapse, in May 1949, the amount of currency issued increased by 176.8 billion times compared with June 1937, and during the same period, prices in Shanghai rose by 138,842 billion times. Due to the impact of production decline, the total value of international trade in 1948 was reduced to only 28% of that in 1931. Under the unanimous opposition of the Chinese people, the reactionary and corrupt rule of Chiang Kai-shek was finally overthrown. The U.S. government's arms exports not only did not expand its international trade in China, but instead reduced its international trade in China; at the same time, the U.S. government's arms exports not only did not consolidate the reactionary and corrupt rule of Chiang Kai-shek, but instead accelerated its collapse.

After the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established in October 1949, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great and wise leader of the Chinese people, it has restored and developed China's economy on the dilapidated foundation of old China, and has achieved brilliant achievements in the past two years.

Due to the implementation of land reform, China's agricultural production has been rapidly restored. Farmers across the country no longer have to pay land rent to landlords, which amounts to more than 30 million tons of grain, so they have money to purchase a large number of livestock, fertilizers, waterwheels, and new agricultural tools to restore agricultural production. The Central People's Government has allocated a large amount of funds to engage in water conservancy construction. In the past two years, the total amount of earthwork for various water conservancy constructions has reached 959 million cubic meters. If it is used to build a long embankment with a height and width of one meter each, it can circle the equator of the earth 24 times. Among them, the most huge Huai River water conservancy project benefits 55 million people and covers an area of 210,000 square kilometers. Chinese farmers already have the ability to prevent and overcome natural disasters. Although there have been local water, drought, and insect disasters in the past two years, agricultural production has still achieved bumper harvests. In 1951, compared with 1950, the national agricultural production harvest increased by about 7%. Among them, technical crops increased more, for example, cotton increased by 40.7%, oil crops increased by 27%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 340%, and hemp for sacks increased by 98%, all of which have exceeded the highest records in history. Grain has been sufficient for the food consumption of the people across the country due to the increase in production and reasonable dispatch, and is still continuing to increase production. The potential of soybean, oil crop, tea, silk, and animal husbandry production is very large, and we are planning to increase production according to the needs of domestic and foreign markets. The manual technology of Chinese agricultural production has been gradually improved. Farmer Qu Yaoli created a record of producing 6,840 kilograms of cotton per hectare (hectare), which is more than 900% higher than before the war. Farmer Liu Changwen created a record of producing 10,500 kilograms of rice per hectare. The purchasing power of more than 400 million farmers that emerged after the land reform is an unprecedented huge purchasing power in China, and both means of production and means of livelihood are showing unprecedented boom. Farmers not only purchase a large number of livestock, chemical fertilizers, waterwheels, and new agricultural tools, but also demand the supply of fabrics, soaps, bicycles, flashlights, books, paper, medicines, etc. The purchasing power of farmers has increased rapidly. In Northeast China alone, the sales volume of fabrics has increased significantly. In 1947, 800,000 bolts of cotton cloth were sold, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, 9 million bolts in 1950, and 11 million bolts in 1951. In five years, it has increased nearly 14 times.

Chinese industry has developed rapidly due to the broad domestic market and the patriotic production increase and thrift movement of Chinese workers. In 1951, compared with 1950, rolled steel increased by 78%, cement increased by 63%, coal increased by 18%, and paper increased by 35%. The increase in major industrial products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, tires, rolled steel, cement, copper, caustic soda, soda ash, and glass has exceeded the highest records in Chinese history. China has also begun to manufacture a large number of textile machines and rails. The people have become the masters of the factories, and labor productivity has increased rapidly. For example, the output of cotton yarn per spindle (20 counts yarn, calculated for 20 hours) has reached 1.20 to 1.30 pounds, the output of looms per unit (20 hours) has reached 99 yards, the amount of coal mined by pneumatic picks per person per day in coal mines has reached 258 tons, and the maximum traction of railway locomotives has reached 7207.9 tons. China's handicrafts have also been rapidly restored. Internationally renowned Chinese handicrafts, such as cloisonné, brocade, lace, straw braid, and carpets, have been exported in large quantities. Transportation has been restored. The total transportation volume of China's railways in 1951 has exceeded the highest record in history, and the mileage of newly built railways has also exceeded any year in Chinese history. The grassroots organizations of Chinese cooperatives have developed to more than 139,000, with more than 82 million members, and their trade volume in 1951 increased by 251% compared with 1950. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, China's private industrial and commercial enterprises have achieved certain development. According to statistics from 15 cities including Shanghai and Tianjin, from July 1950 to June 1951, the actual increase in industrial and commercial enterprises was more than 65,000. The wages of Chinese workers have increased significantly. In Northeast China, the wages of workers in 1951 have increased by 260% compared with March 1948. The problem of unemployment has been basically solved, and intellectuals and skilled workers have felt a shortage and need to be trained quickly.

With the development of national industrial and agricultural production, smooth transportation, and basically stable currency, a national-scale, unified, and stable market has been established. Our international economic relations with various countries built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit have also begun to develop rapidly. China's balance of international payments has been realized, and trade credit is unprecedentedly good. In March 1950, one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 42,000 yuan of Chinese Renminbi, and in March 1951, it was only equivalent to 22,800 yuan. Because we have a stable currency system and huge payment capacity, the governments and people who conduct commercial trade with China fully feel various conveniences and benefits, and at the same time guarantee reasonable profits for international trade. In 1951, the total value of China's international trade increased by 100% compared with 1950; it not only exceeded the war period, but also far exceeded the years before the war. On the basis of production development, we are increasingly increasing the export of agricultural products, animal products, mineral products, and industrial products to foreign countries; at the same time, due to the expansion of the domestic market, the need for industrial machinery, materials, raw materials, semi-finished products, and the import of industrial products is also increasing day by day. This development of international trade is stable, normal, and reliable, and will gradually expand its scale along with the progress of China's economic construction.

The prospects for the development of economic relations between China and various countries are very broad and beautiful. China has nearly 500 million hardworking people and nearly 10 million square kilometers of land. Industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery all have superior development conditions. China has long been known to the world for its rich agricultural products, mineral products, and handicrafts. We once exported 2.48 million metric tons of soybeans, 100,000 metric tons of tea, 100,000 metric tons of tung oil,

    我国参加国际经济会议代表团团长
    南汉宸在四日会议上的报告全文主席先生、各位先生：
    国际经济会议是全世界工业家、商业家、农业家、合作社工作者、工会工作者、经济学者的盛会，中国代表团同人前来出席，感到非常愉快。在莫斯科开成了这样来自各方的盛会，我们对国际经济会议筹备委员会的朋友们、尤其是苏联筹备委员会的朋友们的筹备工作，表示衷心的感谢。
    国际经济会议的代表虽然来自各个不同政治制度和社会经济制度的国家，抱有各种不同的观点与信仰，但是对于促进各国间和平合作的发展，却具有共同的希望；经过会议广泛交换意见和进行业务接触之后，我们相信，必将为世界人类寻求出一个在世界和平条件下推广各国间贸易及其他经济关系，以改善人民生活条件的可能途径。因此全世界人民和各国的舆论，对于会议都寄以殷切的期望。我们相信由于各位先生的一致努力，一定能够胜利地完成这一任务。
    一、在和平条件下，推广国际贸易，发展国际经济关系，以改善世界人民生活条件
    目前全世界工业家、商业家、农业家、合作社工作者、工会工作者、经济学者、和广大人民所最关心的是如何推广国际贸易，发展国际经济关系，以改善各国人民的生活条件问题。中国人民在这方面曾经作过多年的努力，我们愿意把我们的体验和意见提供各位先生作参考。
    中国人民曾经深深感受到战争对于经济的危害。谁都知道，第二次世界大战曾经造成各国经济的严重破坏。如众所知，第二次世界大战是在中国开始的，一九三一年日本帝国主义对于东北的侵略，挑起第二次世界大战的序幕；中国人民在第二次世界大战过程中，经历战争的时间最长。当第二次世界大战宣告终结的时候，中国由于蒋介石反动集团受外力支持而发动反人民的战争，中国的内战又连续四年之久。中国经济在战争中遭受了严重的破坏，在战争过程中，工商业纷纷倒闭，工人和知识分子大量失业，农民及手工业者大量破产，人民生活水准极度降低。战争带来经济的破坏和人民生活水准的降低，已经是为历史所一再证明的规律。但是第二次世界大战的创伤尚未平复，就有一些国家企图从扩张军备、准备战争的过程中，寻求解脱经济危机的道路。扩张军备、准备战争，必然扩大政府的军事预算，增加人民负担，同时扩大军事工业的生产，缩小民用工业的生产，结果就迫使人民购买力趋于降低，工商业因之停工减产，失业人数日益增加，人民生活水准日益下降。扩张军备，准备战争，不但没有把这些国家从经济危机之中解救出来，而且使这些国家陷入更为深重的经济危机之中。
    美国政府企图依靠对于苏联、中国与各人民民主主义国家实施封锁与禁运，来达到垄断世界市场、缓和本国经济危机到来的目的。但它这种企图应用于拥有八亿以上人口和广大土地的苏联、中国、及各人民民主主义国家，谁也知道这是一种不可能实现的幻想，实际上只便于美国政府假借名义，以利其进行垄断原料与商品市场的勾当。可是亚洲，欧洲，美洲，许多国家对于苏联、中国及各人民民主主义国家的国际贸易，原已有数十年以至百年的历史，一旦被禁止往来，便不可避免地增加了他们自己的困难。例如欧洲和美洲工商业家，增加了自中国输入大豆、猪鬃、桐油、蛋品的困难；日本工商业家增加了自中国输入便宜的煤、盐、大豆和其它商品的困难；亚洲各国工商业家增加了自中国输入食物、大豆和轻工业品的困难；而美国政府却正在利用他们的困难，以加强对于他们的控制。同时封锁与禁运又使亚洲、欧洲、美洲许多国家的工商业家失掉了工业器材、化工原料、工业制品、工业原料和农产品的广大市场；而美国政府则正在利用他们的困难，肆意压价收购。美国政府原来企图通过这种措施，将经济危机转嫁到别人身上，但实际上它自己国内的民用工业生产亦大大缩小，军事工业生产无限扩大，因之并未能和缓其经济危机的到来，却徒然使更多国家陷在更深的经济危机的漩涡之中。因此荒谬愚蠢的封锁与禁运，自始即遭受全世界人民和许多国家政府的反对，注定了即将遭受完全失败的命运。
    我们认为必须在世界和平的条件下，推广国际贸易，发展国际经济关系，以改善世界人民的生活条件。中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席于一九四九年十月一日政府成立之日即向各国政府明白宣布：“凡愿遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的任何外国政府，本政府均愿与之建立外交关系。”我们一贯拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民的友好合作。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领明确规定了“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”的方针。我们对于与各国的经济关系，采取积极的恢复与发展的方针。我们对于各国政府和人民，不管其信仰、政治制度、社会经济组织的不同，只要在平等和互利的基础上，均愿与之恢复与发展通商贸易关系。我们深信各种不同政治制度的国家之间可以和平共处，并发展国际经济关系。我们认为国际经济关系的发展必须建筑在平等互利的基础之上，必须互相尊重对方政治的独立、贸易的自主和经济发展的利益；反对干涉对方的主权，实行倾销、垄断和吞并的政策。这种平等和互利的国际贸易，是符合于中国人民的利益，同时亦是符合于世界人民的利益的。我们认为目前只有在世界和平条件下发展国际经济关系，取消封锁与禁运，并充分开展国际间的贸易，才能帮助那些有经济危机的国家从危机中解脱出来，恢复和平工业的生产，并使那里的人民生活条件逐步改善，这些道理都是很明白的。
    二、中国经济建设两年来的成就已经为发展国际经济关系规划了远大的前景
    中国人民不仅有和平条件下发展国际经济关系的愿望，而且由于中国经济建设两年来的成就，已经大大增强了中国与各国发展经济关系的力量，为中国国际贸易的发展规划了远大的前景。
    蒋介石反动政府的腐朽统治，及其在美国政府援助之下所进行的内战，曾使中国经济濒临于瓦解的境地。在战争中，铁道和公路被损坏一半以上，农业生产减少至战前的百分之七十五，重工业产量只相当于历史上最高一年的百分之三十，轻工业产量只相当于百分之七十。蒋介石反动政府曾保持过庞大的军事预算，致造成严重的通货膨胀，在它崩溃的前夕，一九四九年五月较之一九三七年六月，通货发行额增加了一、七六八亿倍，同时期上海的物价上升了一三八、八四二亿倍。国际贸易总值由于生产衰退的影响，一九四八年曾经降低到只合一九三一年的百分之二十八。在中国人民的一致反对下，蒋介石的反动腐朽统治终于被推翻了。美国政府的军火输出不但没有扩大它在中国的国际贸易，反而缩小了它在中国的国际贸易；同时美国政府的军火输出不但没有巩固了蒋介石的反动腐朽统治，反而加速了它的崩溃。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府于一九四九年十月成立以后，在中国人民的伟大的英明的领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，在旧中国残破不堪的基础上，恢复和发展中国的经济，两年来已经获得了辉煌的成就。
    由于实施土地改革，中国的农业生产已经迅速地恢复起来。全国农民已经不再向地主缴纳总数达三千万吨以上粮食的地租了，因此有钱大量购置牲畜、肥料、水车和新式农具，以恢复农业生产。中央人民政府曾经拨出大量的经费从事水利建设，两年来各种水利建设的土方总量已达九亿五千九百万立方公尺，若以之筑成高宽各一公尺的长堤，可以绕地球赤道二十四周，其中最为巨大的淮河水利工程，受益人民五千五百万，受惠土地二十一万平方公里。中国农民已经有防备与战胜灾荒的能力。两年来虽然局部地区有水、旱、虫灾，但农业生产仍告丰收。一九五一年较之一九五○年，全国农业生产收获量约增加百分之七。其中技术作物增产较多，例如棉花增产百分之四○·七，油料作物增产百分之二七，烤烟增产百分之三四○，麻袋用麻增产百分之九八，均已超过历史上的最高纪录。粮食由于生产增加和调度合理，已经足够全国人民的食用，现在尚在继续增产。大豆、油料作物、茶叶、蚕丝和畜牧业生产的潜在能力很大，我们正按照国内外市场的需要，有计划地增加生产。中国农业生产的手工技术已经逐渐提高，农民曲耀离创造了每公顷（海克脱）生产六千八百四十公斤棉花的纪录，较之战前高出百分之九百以上，农民刘长文创造了每公顷生产一万零五百公斤水稻的纪录。土地改革后出现的四亿以上农民的购买力，是中国空前未有的庞大的购买力，不论生产资料或生活资料，都呈现空前的畅销。农民不仅大量购买牲口、化学肥料、水车、新式农具，并要求布匹、肥皂、自行车、电棒、书籍、纸张、药品等的供应。农民购买力迅速增长，仅在东北布匹销售量即曾大量的增加，一九四七年棉布销售八十万匹，一九四八年一百二十万匹，一九四九年三百二十万匹，一九五○年九百万匹，一九五一年一千一百万匹。五年之中，增加了近十四倍。
    中国工业由于国内市场的广阔，和中国职工的发动爱国主义的增产节约运动，而迅速地发展起来。一九五一年较之一九五○年，辗钢增产百分之七十八，水泥增产百分之六十三，煤增产百分之十八，纸张增产百分之三十五，主要工业品如棉纱、棉布、纸张、轮胎、辗钢、水泥、铜、烧碱、纯碱、玻璃等的增产，均已超过中国历史上的最高纪录。中国并已开始大量制造纺织机器和铁轨。人民变成工厂的主人，劳动生产率迅速提高，例如棉纱每锭（二十支纱，二十小时计算）产量已达一·二○至一·三○磅、织布机每台（二十小时）产量已达九十九码，煤矿每人每日风镐采煤二五八吨，铁路机车牵引最高达七二○七·九吨。中国的手工业也已迅速恢复，国际闻名的中国手工艺品，如景泰蓝、织锦、花边、草帽辫、地毯等均已大量出口。交通已经恢复，中国铁道一九五一年的运输总量，已经超过历史上最高纪录，新修的铁路里程亦已超过中国历史上任何一年。中国合作社的基层组织已发展到十三万九千多个，社员有八千二百多万人，其一九五一年贸易额已较一九五○年增至百分之二百五十一。中国私人工商业，在国营经济的领导下获得一定的发展，据上海、天津等十五城市统计，一九五○年七月至一九五一年六月，工商业实增六万五千余户。中国工人的工资有很大增加，东北职工工资一九五一年较之一九四八年三月已增至百分之二百六十。失业问题已经基本解决，知识分子和熟练工人已经感到缺乏，需要迅速培养。
    在全国工业农业生产发展、交通畅通、货币基本稳定的情况下，全国规模的、统一的、稳定的市场已经建立。我们与各个国家建筑在平等与互利的基础之上的国际经济关系，亦已开始迅速的发展。中国国际收支平衡已经实现，贸易信用空前良好。中国人民币一九五○年三月每美元合四万二千元，一九五一年三月仅合二万二千八百元。由于我们有稳定的币制，和巨大的支付能力，使与中国进行通商贸易的政府与人民，充分感受各种的方便和利益，同时保证了国际贸易的合理利润。一九五一年中国国际贸易总值比一九五○年增加一倍；不仅超过了战争时期，而且远远超过战争以前的年代。我们在生产发展的基础上，日益增加农产品、畜产品、矿产品、工业品的向国外输出；同时由于国内市场的扩大，需要日益增加工业机器、材料、原料、半制品、以及工业品的输入。这种国际贸易的发展是稳定、正常、而可靠的，而且将随着中国经济建设的进展，而日益扩大其规模。
    中国与各国经济关系的发展前途，是非常远大而美好的。中国拥有近五亿的勤劳的人民，近一千万平方公里的土地，工业、农业、林业、畜牧、水产，均有优越的发展条件。中国久以农产品、矿产品和手工艺品丰富著称于世界，我们曾经于一年之内输出大豆二百四十八万公吨；茶叶十万公吨；桐油十万公吨；锑二万公吨；蛋品七万公吨；花生二十五万公吨；生丝一万公吨；食盐十万公吨；煤七百四十三万公吨。今后在中国经济建设过程中，中国农业和工业生产均将猛步前进。中国人民必将提供更多的农业品、畜产品、矿产品、工业品和手工艺品向国外的输出，同时需要向各国购买更多的工业机器、材料、原料、和各种工业用品，以及其它各种农产品、畜产品，以发展国内工业农业生产，充分满足日益增长的国内市场的需要。
    三、中国与各国经济关系发展的远大前途
    扩张军备、准备战争和封锁禁运，必然是破坏各国经济的恢复和发展，使人民生活条件日益困难和恶化，而在和平条件下发展国际经济关系，才是各国所必须遵循的道路，因此，我们认为，中国与世界各国的经济关系，是有着远大的发展前途的。
    中国对于苏联及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜、蒙古、越南等人民民主主义国家已经建立了和平友好的外交关系与平等互利的通商贸易关系。中国与苏联及各人民民主主义国家之间的贸易，是完全建筑在和平友好的平等互利的基础之上的，互相尊重对方的主权和对方经济发展的利益。苏联曾经供应中国以大量的工业、农业、交通的机械和器材，对于中国经济建设有极大的帮助。中国以大量的工业原料和食物供应苏联的需要，也有利于苏联人民的生活。今后我们仍将继续发展对于苏联及各人民民主主义国家之间的和平友好与经济关系。
    我们认为中国对于欧洲其他各国不论有无外交关系，也完全可以建立同样的平等与互利的国际贸易关系。欧洲有些国家例如英国，对于中国的国际贸易，自一九四九年十月以来曾经有很大的恢复与发展。只是这些国家由于受到外来的控制，其中大部分国家自己限制了对于中国的贸易的往来，使他们遭受了原来可以不必遭受的一些新的困难。我们认为这种困难情况是可以立即改变的，只要这些国家摆脱外来的控制，取消不利于自己的封锁和禁运。我们并认为中国与欧洲其他各国，首先是英国、法国及西欧、北欧等国贸易的进一步扩大，将使欧洲国家有可能自中国获得各种食品和工业原料的供应，同时有可能向中国推销和平工业的产品，这将有利于我们彼此各国恢复与发展和平工业的生产，并改善人民的生活条件。中国人民愿意在这方面，贡献自己的力量。
    中国与东南亚的印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国，已经建立了和平友好的外交关系及平等互利的通商贸易关系。尽管有人企图阻止这种友谊和经济关系的发展，但是各国人民决不会让他们的阴谋得逞。因此中国与亚洲乃至非洲各国之间的平等互利的经济关系，今后必将得到发展的机会。亚洲许多国家均拥有丰富的资源，而且是世界主要原料和农产品的输出国家。但是有些国家由于受到外国的牵制，很难换回他们所需要的机器和工业品，以发展它们国内的经济和改善人民的生活条件。封锁、禁运和世界原料的垄断，已使亚洲许多国家遭受严重的损失。例如橡胶自禁运以来，价格连续下跌，已使生产者的积极性大为降低，人民生活水准亦受影响。我们认为世界人民必须重视亚洲国家对于世界原料和农产品供应的伟大贡献，同时应当尊重亚洲国家的独立、主权及其民族工业向前发展的利益，且必须在平等和互利的基础上，建立其对于亚洲各国的经济合作关系。
    中国人民认为日本如能拒绝重新武装，发展和平工业，并与各国建立平等互利的国际贸易关系，将完全符合于日本人民的利益。目前美国政府正在控制他们，使日本恢复和发展日本人民所不愿意恢复和发展的军火生产，而不能发展它所愿意发展的和平工业，并完全限制了日本对外的正常贸易关系。日本人民生活条件因之难于改善，而日本对于各国的国际关系亦日益趋于紧张。日本工业本需要中国的价廉物美的煤、盐、大豆、油脂原料及其它产品，而中国亦需要日本的工业机器、材料和工业品。但日本自被限制对外的正常贸易关系以来，已经不能购买中国的较为便宜的煤，而必须去购买美国的更贵的煤，这是极不平等极不合理的现象。我们相信，具有和平愿望与民族自尊心的日本人民是不会长期忍受这种横蛮无理的控制和限制的。中国人民愿意看到日本能够健全发展和平经济，并恢复和发展中日两国间的正常贸易关系，使日本人民的生活条件不再遭受战争的威胁和损害而得到真正改善的可能。
    美国政府不顾美国人民的意愿与需要，在干涉朝鲜战争和侵占中国的台湾之后，对中国实施了封锁与禁运。这种封锁断绝美国人急切需要的中国猪鬃、桐油（历年美国由中国进口的均占美国该项商品进口总额的百分之九十以上）的供应。我们认为促使美国政府取消封锁与禁运措施，以恢复中美贸易的努力，是完全正当的，中国人民对于这种努力，愿意寄以希望。
    中国人民对于与其他国家的经济关系，在和平友好、平等互利的基础上，亦均有建立与发展的愿望。
    四、国际经济会议必将获得成功，且将成为全世界人民为发展国际经济关系而作进一步努力的开始
    中国代表团建议，国际经济会议为实现在和平条件下推广国际贸易、发展国际经济关系，以改善人民生活条件这一主张，应向全世界的工业家、商业家、农业家、合作社工作者、工会工作者、经济学者、广大人民和各国政府发出建议，要求各国政府之间和各国人民之间，建立平等互利的、互助合作的国际贸易关系。国际贸易必须不管信仰、政治制度、社会经济组织的不同，而在和平友好、平等互利的基础上广泛展开。会议期间应积极发展各种贸易谈判，以实际行动促进各国之间贸易关系的开展。
    中国代表团并建议国际经济会议于会后设立常设机构，以切实推进国际经济关系的发展。
    中国代表团在会议期间与会议以后，均欢迎各位先生与我们广泛地交换意见，建立一定的联系。我们不仅愿意交换一般的原则的意见，而且愿意进行各种具体的业务活动。我们坚信，经过各位先生的努力，国际经济会议必将获得成功，并将成为全世界人民为在和平条件下发展国际经济关系而作进一步努力的开始。最后谨祝各位先生的健康，并向苏联友人的热诚招待致谢。
