Why Did Cotton Production Decrease in the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area of Shaanxi Last Year?

The Jinghuiqu irrigation area includes Liquan, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, and Lintong counties. It is a very important cotton-producing area in Shaanxi Province and in China. This area has a long history of cotton planting and has good water conservancy conditions. In 1951, the total cotton planting area in the region was more than one million mu, of which about 430,000 mu were irrigated by the Jinghuiqu canal water, and another part was irrigated by small canals and well water. The unit area yield of cotton in this area has always been very high and relatively stable. In normal years, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu can reach about 60 jin, which is more than double the current national average cotton field yield.

In 1951, the rainfall in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province was even, and cotton in dry land, well water land, or new canal water land (such as land irrigated by the Luohuiqu canal) generally had a bumper harvest. Generally, dry land can also yield 40 to 45 jin of ginned cotton per mu. However, cotton in the Jinghuiqu water area decreased in production. Not only was the harvest lower than in normal years, but the yield of most canal water land was even lower than that of dry land. For example, in Balijiao Village, Sanyuan County, each mu of cotton field in the canal water area only produced 35 to 45 jin of ginned cotton. In Tanlifan Village near Gaoling County, each mu of general cotton field in the canal water area only produced 20 to 30 jin of ginned cotton. However, in Huachidu Village, Jingyang County, most of the land is saline-alkali dry land, but it still harvested 50 to 60 jin of ginned cotton, exceeding the cotton yield of the canal water land by one-quarter to one time.

What were the reasons for the decrease in cotton production in the Jinghuiqu water area in 1951?

First, pest control work was not done well. In 1951, cotton fields in the Jinghui area generally suffered from aphids, and the affected area was estimated to account for more than 80% of the cotton field area. However, due to the lack of medicines and equipment when controlling aphids, some used the method of spreading ash from weeds and trees, which had very little effect. A small number used tobacco water or cotton oil soap to control them, but the number of treatments was only two or three times at most, and most cotton fields were basically not treated. Taking Tanlifan Village in Gaoling County as an example, aphids were found in about 10% of the cotton fields in mid-June. At first, the farmers did not pay much attention to it, but by the end of June, it had spread to all the cotton fields. At that time, the local people's government had begun to mobilize for control, but because the pest area was too large, there was a shortage of medicines and equipment, and there was also a shortage of labor, so it was felt that it could not be controlled. As cotton farmer Chen Gongyi said: "In the past, aphids were not serious, but I didn't expect them to be so severe this year. All 17 mu of cotton fields I planted were infested with insects. Because there were few people and a shortage of medicines, I first grabbed the serious ones to treat, but in the end, none were treated." According to statistics, the treated area in this village was less than 10%. Because most of the cotton plants suffered from aphids, the young leaves shrank and withered, leaving only the top buds, so the growing period was prolonged after the aphid infestation. Although the frost in the autumn of 1951 was late, frost flowers still accounted for more than 20% (frost flowers were extremely rare in the past). At the same time, some cotton fields were seriously short of seedlings due to aphid infestation. For example, Wu Yingzhou, who planted 14 mu of cotton in Wujiazhuang, Gaoling County, was short of seedlings by about 30%, and only harvested 10 jin of ginned cotton per mu on average. In some areas of Sanyuan County, bridge worms continued to damage after the aphid infestation, which greatly reduced the yield.

Second, rainfall and irrigation overlapped. In 1951, the first and second irrigations of cotton fields in the Jinghuiqu canal were from late June to early August, which coincided with the rainy season. According to meteorological records of the Jinghuiqu Canal Administration, the rainfall in Sanyuan, Gaoling, and Jingyang counties in July ranged from 95 to 132 mm. As a result of the repeated supply of cotton fields with large amounts of irrigation water and sufficient rainwater, the phenomenon of excessive growth of cotton branches and a large number of fallen buds and bolls was promoted. For example, in Tanlifan Village, Gaoling County, although the rainfall a few days before the summer solstice was not heavy, it was still enough for moisture. Later, when the Jinghuiqu canal released water to irrigate the cotton fields, more than half of the cotton fields in the village were irrigated. However, it was followed by seven or eight consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather from July 25th to August 1st. After being harmed by aphids, the new branches and leaves of cotton are small, and the cell tissue is fragile. In addition, the groundwater level is generally high, and the cotton fields are damp. As a result of supplying a large amount of water, the cotton plants lost the balance between water absorption and evaporation, resulting in excessive growth and bud shedding. Cotton farmer Chen Gongyi said: "The fruit branches below the third and fourth stages did not produce bolls (cotton bolls), and as a result, the ground was covered with buds (cotton buds)." Zhang Jinxiang in Shuangxian Village, Jingyang County, planted 17.5 mu of cotton last year, of which 2.5 mu were irrigated with canal water around June 20. Later, it was followed by the rain in late July, and there was no more irrigation. The cotton grew best, with an average yield of more than 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Six mu were not watered at all, with an average yield of more than 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Another 9 mu were irrigated with canal water around July 20, and after the irrigation, there were seven or eight days of cloudy and rainy weather. The cotton grew wildly and shed buds. Fortunately, the pruning was timely, and the average yield was about 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This shows that the overlap of rainfall and irrigation is also an important reason for the decrease in production.

In order to learn from the lessons of last year's production decrease and increase this year's cotton production, the following points should be noted:

1. Strengthen the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. The Jinghuiqu general water area has many weeds, and the cotton fields are concentrated, so there are more opportunities for diseases and insect pests to breed. We should implement the pest control policy of "prevention is more important than cure" and educate farmers to do a good job in spring plowing and weeding. We should promote frequent crop rotation. Relevant departments such as local cooperatives, trade companies, and banks should vigorously prepare pesticides and equipment to ensure that there are enough medicines available when insect pests occur, so as to achieve timely detection and thorough elimination. At the same time, farmers can also be called upon to plant a small amount of local tobacco for preparing medicines.

2. Further improve the irrigation method of canal water. In order to use water rationally, the Jinghuiqu canal stipulated in 1951 that water should be irrigated from bottom to top and in installments, irrigating half of the cotton fields each time, eliminating the evil consequences of the feudal water regulations in the past that "the upstream irrigation destroys the cotton fields, and the downstream drought destroys the cotton." This year, in order to further save water and overcome the shortcomings of insufficient or untimely canal water, we should learn from the experience of Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting model in Shanxi Province, who advocated "light and frequent irrigation," and mobilize and organize the masses of farmers to make more small ridges in large ridges, or implement the method of irrigating every other row with thin water and frequently, and saving water. In this way, each time the cotton fields can be generally irrigated, and the amount of water can be controlled to avoid the harm of excessive irrigation and rainwater.

3. In terms of cultivation techniques, attention should be paid to: (1) Local farmers have become accustomed to topping, but they are not very careful in removing superfluous buds and pruning. Typical experiences should be promoted and meticulous pruning should be implemented. (2) Some cotton farmers still have the habit of broadcasting when sowing. Farmers should be guided to change to row sowing and promote seeders (plows) to save labor. (3) It is correct for local farmers to pay attention to dense planting, but some cotton fields have too close row spacing (1.1 or 2 feet), and the cotton fields are too closed, so there is insufficient sunlight and weeding is not convenient. Therefore, the row spacing should be appropriately widened, and the plant spacing should be flexibly adjusted in combination with other cultivation conditions. (4) In terms of seed selection, in addition to grain selection, field selection should be further promoted.

    去年陕西泾惠渠灌溉区棉花为什么减产
    中央人民政府农业部西北军政委员会农林部调查组
    泾惠渠灌溉区包括醴泉、泾阳、三原、高陵、临潼五县，是陕西省也是我国的一个很重要的产棉区。这个地区已经有很久的植棉历史，并且有很好的水利条件。一九五一年全区植棉面积共有一百多万亩，其中约有四十三万多亩是用泾惠渠水灌溉，另有一部分是用小型渠水和井水灌溉。这个地区的水地棉花单位面积产量向来是很高的，而且还比较稳定，平常的年景平均每亩可产皮棉六十斤左右，超过目前全国棉田平均产量的一倍。
    一九五一年陕西省关中地区雨水均匀，旱地、井水地或新渠水地（如洛惠渠灌溉的土地）棉花普遍丰收。一般旱地每亩也可收到皮棉四十到四十五斤。但泾惠渠水地棉花却反而减产，不但较平常年的收成低，甚至大部分渠水地产量还不及旱地。如三原县八里焦村渠水地每亩棉田仅产皮棉三十五到四十五斤，高陵县滩里樊村附近渠水地一般棉田每亩仅产皮棉二十到三十斤。而泾阳县花池渡村大部分是硝硷旱地，还收了皮棉五十到六十斤，超过了渠水地棉花产量的四分之一到一倍。
    泾惠渠水地棉花一九五一年减产的原因是什么？
    第一、没有做好除虫工作。一九五一年泾惠区的棉田普遍发生蚜虫，被害面积估计占棉田面积八成以上。但在除治蚜虫时因药械不足，一部分利用撒扬草木灰办法除治，效力很小；一小部分用烟草水或棉油皂除治，但除治次数最多只有二、三次，大部分棉田基本上没治。以高陵县滩里樊村为例，六月中旬约有一成棉田发现蚜虫，开始农民不十分注意，到六月下旬就蔓延到全部棉田。当时当地人民政府虽已开始动员除治，但因虫害面积太大，药械不足，劳力又少，已感觉治不过来。如棉农陈公义说：“从前蚜虫不重，想不到今年这么厉害。我种十七亩棉田全生了虫，因人少药缺，就先抓住重的治，结果没有治了。”统计这村除治面积不到一成。因为大部棉株遭受蚜害后，幼叶萎缩枯谢，只剩下顶尖的心芽，所以经过蚜害后，延长了生长期。一九五一年秋季虽然降霜较晚，但霜花仍占二成以上（过去霜花极少）。同时部分棉田又因蚜害造成严重缺苗。如高陵县吴家庄吴瀛洲种棉十四亩，缺苗约三成，平均每亩只收到皮棉十斤；三原县有些地区蚜害后又连续发生造桥虫为害，更使产量大大减少。
    第二、雨水和灌溉重复。一九五一年泾惠渠第一、二两次灌溉棉田的时间是在六月下旬至八月上旬，在这时期里适值雨季来临。据泾惠渠管理局测候记载：七月份内三原、高陵、泾阳县一带降雨量由九十五到一百三十二公厘不等。这样用大水灌溉和充分雨水重复供给棉田的结果，就促成了棉枝徒长和大量落蕾落铃的现象。如高陵县滩里樊村在入伏前几天降雨虽不大，但还够墒，后来泾惠渠放水浇棉田时，全村就灌溉了半数以上的棉田。可是，接着就碰上了七月二十五日到八月一日连续七、八天的阴雨。棉花经蚜害后，新生枝叶较小，细胞组织脆弱，加上地下水位一般较高，棉田阴湿，这样多量水分供给的结果，棉株吸收水分和蒸发作用就失去了平衡，结果促成狂长和落蕾。棉农陈公义说：“第三、四期以下的果枝没有坐住疙瘩（棉铃），结果满地落的是眼子（棉蕾）。”泾阳县双贤村张金祥去年植棉十七亩半，其中有二亩半在六月二十日左右浇了一次渠水，后来接上七月下旬的雨水，以后就没有再浇，棉花生长最好，平均每亩可收皮棉一百二十多斤；有六亩完全没浇水，平均每亩收皮棉一百一十多斤；另有九亩在七月二十日前后灌了一次渠水，灌后接上七、八天阴雨，棉花便狂长落蕾，幸而整枝及时，平均每亩约收皮棉六十斤。这说明雨水和灌溉重复也是减产的重要原因。
    为接受去年减产的教训和提高今年棉花的产量，有以下几点应当注意：
    一、加强防治病虫害。泾惠渠一般水地杂草繁多，棉田又集中，病虫滋生的机会较多，应贯彻“防重于治”的除虫方针，教育农民做好春耕和除草工作；提倡勤换茬。各地合作社、贸易公司、银行等有关部门，应大力准备好治虫药械，以保证发生虫害时有足够的药剂可用，做到及时发现及时除净。同时还可号召农民种植一小部分土烟，以备配药剂用。
    二、更进一步改善渠水的灌溉方法。为了合理使水，泾惠渠在一九五一年规定出由下而上、分次灌水，每次灌溉棉田半数，消除了从前封建水规造成的“上游灌毁了棉田，下游旱毁了棉花”的恶果。今年为了更进一步节省水量，克服渠水不足或不及时的缺陷，应吸取山西省植棉模范曲耀离“轻浇勤浇”的经验，动员和组织农民群众在大畦内多做小畦，或实行隔行灌水的细水勤浇和节省水量的浇地办法。这样每次给水棉田既可普遍得到灌溉，又可节制用水分量，以避免灌水和雨水多的害处。
    三、在耕作技术方面应注意：（一）当地农民对摘心工作已成为习惯，但对除赘芽和整枝作得很不细致；应推广典型经验，推行细致整枝。（二）部分棉农播种时仍有撒播的习惯，应引导农民改成条播，并推广播种器（耧），以节省劳力。（三）当地农民群众重视密植是正确的，但有部分棉田行距太近（一尺一、二寸），棉田过分郁闭，因此阳光不足，除草也不方便。因此应适当加宽行距，再结合其他栽培条件，灵活伸缩株距。（四）在选种方面除粒选外，应更进一步推行田间选种。
