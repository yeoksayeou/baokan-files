This is a Tibetan rural village in Qamdo County, which the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet liberated two years ago. It's called Baige Village, located in a river valley twenty li northeast of Qamdo City. The village is home to twelve Tibetan farming families who were all impoverished before liberation. After liberation, they had successive bumper harvests, and new houses have appeared in the village. The river valley is very beautiful every late spring and early summer. At that time, the farmers drive yaks to cultivate the land and sow highland barley. In autumn, the roofs of every house in the village are towering with highland barley frames like sails.

I visited Baige Village in early winter last year, when the farmers were harvesting highland barley. The sounds of threshing and joyful singing frequently came from behind the highland barley frames. When I walked up to a tall new house, an old Tibetan farmer named Quetsedenzhu greeted me with a comforting smile on his face. He invited me to visit his new house, saying repeatedly, "If the People's Liberation Army hadn't come to liberate us, I wouldn't have been able to build this new house even if I lived another lifetime!" Quetsedenzhu is already sixty-six years old and has lived in Baige Village for thirty years. He recalled the past, saying, "At that time, a family of seven couldn't get enough to eat or wear, and we still had to endure beatings and abuse."

Old man Quetsedenzhu's entire family are strong and able-bodied laborers. After liberation, the People's Liberation Army exempted them from Ula (corvée labor). His son, daughter-in-law, and eldest grandson drove three yaks to join the transportation team. The old man, his wife, and his sister went up the mountain to collect firewood and cut grass to sell in Qamdo during the slack season. The whole family enthusiastically engaged in production. Last spring, Quetsedenzhu learned how to grow vegetables from the soldiers of the troops entering Tibet and planted half a mu of garden. The half mu of vegetables sold for more than one hundred silver dollars in one summer. This is how the new house came about. He pointed to the new house and said joyfully to me, "I built this large fourteen-room house, and the family's life has greatly improved."

Standing on the roof of Quetsedenzhu's new house (a flat-roofed stone house), you can overlook the entire village. Quetsedenzhu pointed to a small house hidden behind the highland barley frames in the east end of the village and told me that it was the home of Awang Qupi, who had been fleeing famine for many years and only returned to the village after liberation. In the north of the village, there is a square courtyard surrounded by a large vegetable garden, which is the home of Zhaxi, who returned to his hometown. Both of their families fled their homes more than ten years ago because of the heavy labor and inability to make a living. At that time, only five households remained in the entire village. Most of the fields were barren, and the roofs of the houses had been washed away by rain. These two families are still the poorest in the village, but they are much better off than before. Their roofs are also piled high with highland barley, and the dilapidated houses have been repaired. One day, the mother of the farmer Awang Qupi gratefully said to me, "In the spring, the people's government lent seeds to the families who fled and returned, and now we have harvested this highland barley."

Last year, Baige Village, like all the villages in the Qamdo area, had a bumper harvest. Highland barley production increased by more than double compared to previous years. After the bumper harvest, the whole village increased by eight donkeys, six yaks, and more than twenty sheep. Farmers who couldn't afford zanba in the past now even eat butter and beef. Many families have also added new clothes. Now, spring has returned to the Kangzang Plateau, and the farmers of Baige Village are busily preparing for spring plowing.

    走向幸福的藏民村
    新华社记者  袁传方
    这是一个昌都县的藏民农村，人民解放军入藏部队解放它已经两年了。它名叫白格村，在昌都城东北二十华里的一个河谷中。这个村一共住着十二家藏族农民，解放前大家都很穷困；解放后接连得到丰收，村里已出现了新修的房子。每年春末夏初，河谷是很美丽的。那时候，农民们便赶着牦牛耕地播种青稞。到了秋天，村子里每家屋顶上都高耸着像船帆一样的青稞架。
    去年初冬我访问了白格村，那时候农民们正在收割青稞。从青稞架的后面频频地传出劈劈拍拍的打场声和欢乐的歌声。当我走上一座高大的新房子时，一个名叫却次登珠的藏族老农，满脸现出宽慰的笑容来接待我。他邀我参观他的新房子，连声说：“要不是解放军来解放了我们，我再活一辈子也盖不起这座新房子呀！”却次登珠已经六十六岁了，在白格村住过三十年。他回忆过去时说：“那时候一家七口，吃不饱、穿不暖，还要捱打受气。”
    却次登珠老汉全家都是精强力壮的劳动者。解放后，人民解放军免除了乌拉（差务），儿子、儿媳和大孙子赶着三头牦牛参加了运输队；老汉和他的妻子、他的妹妹，在农闲时，还上山打柴、割草背到昌都去卖，全家都热情地生产着。去年春天，却次登珠从入藏部队的战士们那儿学会种菜后又种了半亩园，半亩蔬菜一个夏天卖了一百多个银元。这些就是新房子的由来。他指着新房子喜洋洋地向我说：“我盖了这座十四间的大房子，家的生活大大地改善了。”
    站在却次登珠家的新房顶上（石头平顶房），可以俯视全村。却次登珠指着村东头隐藏在青稞架里的一座小屋告诉我：那就是多年逃荒在外，解放后才回村的阿旺曲皮家；在村北边有一大片菜园围绕着的方院，那就是重返故乡的扎西家。他们两家都是十多年前，因为差役繁重，无法生活逃出家门的。那时，全村逃亡得只剩下五户，田地大半都荒芜了，房屋都被雨水冲塌了顶。这两家现在还是村里顶穷的两家，但是比过去好多了，他们的屋顶上也都堆满了青稞，破旧的房屋已修补过。有一天，农民阿旺曲皮的母亲感激地向我说：“春天，我们逃亡回来的几家，人民政府贷种籽给我们，现在我们才收了这些青稞。”
    去年，白格村和昌都地区的所有村庄一样都丰收了，青稞比往年增产了一倍多。丰收后，全村共增加驴子八匹、牦牛六头、羊二十多只。过去吃不上?粑的农民，现在连酥油和牛肉都吃到了。很多的人家还添了新衣。现在，春天又回到了康藏高原，白格村的农民正在紧张地准备春耕了。
