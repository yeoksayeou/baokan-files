Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th. According to TASS: The working people of Poland warmly celebrated the sixtieth birthday of the President of the Polish Republic and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Beirut, on April 18th. On that day, national flags flew all over the cities and villages of the country, and a festive atmosphere prevailed everywhere. People in various places held rallies to celebrate this joyous day for the whole country.

The Warsaw celebration was held at the National Polish Theatre. The meeting was attended by government leaders headed by Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, members of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, representatives of other democratic parties, cultural and social workers from Warsaw, and representatives of advanced workers, farmers, and intellectuals from all over the country. Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, various People's Democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic to Poland also attended the meeting.

When the presidium headed by Beirut stepped onto the rostrum, the audience stood up and applauded Beirut to pay their respects.

The meeting was presided over by the Speaker of the Polish Parliament, Kowalski. He said that the Polish people love and respect their president because he carried out a heroic struggle to liberate the people from the shackles of Hitlerite fascism, led the vanguard of the revolution along the only correct path of friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union, united the best patriots and democrats around him, and strived for the revival and independence of the motherland and for the establishment of a people's democratic system.

Next, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz read out the congratulatory telegram from J.V. Stalin to Beirut. The entire audience stood up while it was read. After the telegram was read, the audience paid tribute to Stalin with thunderous applause, and shouts of "Stalin! Beirut!" resounded throughout the venue.

The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Ochab, gave a report on Beirut's sixtieth birthday at the meeting. He said that the life and activities of Beirut, a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, are inextricably linked with the heroic struggle of the Polish working class against domestic reactionaries and Hitlerite fascism, a struggle that has ended with the historical victory of the working class – the establishment of the Polish People's Republic. For eight years, under the leadership of Comrade Beirut, People's Poland has completed great creative work and has now entered a new and great era in our people's long history – the socialist era. Ochab continued: Under the leadership of Comrade Beirut, the Polish United Workers' Party has creatively applied the theory of Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of People's Poland to seek the interests of our people and the interests of the world's peaceful and progressive camp headed by the Soviet Union. Ochab said: Comrade Beirut is as correct as Stalin in his thoughts and as firm as Stalin in his beliefs. Comrade Beirut has waged unremitting struggles for the victory of people's democracy, for the establishment of a socialist Poland, for peace and the happiness of our people, for strengthening the fraternal friendship between the people of Poland, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries, and for increasing our country's contribution to the great cause of world peace and progress. Therefore, Comrade Beirut has won the heartfelt support of millions of workers and farmers, scientists and artists, teachers, young men and women, and patriotic Polish people within and outside the Party.

Ochab's speech was frequently interrupted by applause from the audience, who applauded to pay tribute to the Soviet Union, the bulwark of maintaining peace and international security, to Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the people of all countries in the world, and to Beirut, the leader of People's Poland.

Representatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, soldiers, and students spoke at the meeting one after another.

Cyrankiewicz then read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, which were greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the participants. Cyrankiewicz also announced that Comrade Beirut had also received congratulatory telegrams from Kim Il-sung, Ho Chi Minh, Gottwald, Pieck, Rákosi, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Pollitt, Hoxha, and Reimann.

In his reply, Beirut spoke about the important role played by the Polish United Workers' Party in the life and struggle of the Polish people and its close ties with the working people. He emphasized that in all its activities, the Polish United Workers' Party takes the heroic Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an exemplar. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have built socialist society and are now building communist society.

Finally, amidst stormy applause, the meeting passed a telegram of tribute to J.V. Stalin.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th. According to TASS: The Central People's Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Polish Republic held a joint meeting in Warsaw on the 17th.
