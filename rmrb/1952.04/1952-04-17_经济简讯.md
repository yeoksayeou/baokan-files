Economic Briefs

    ▲ The Li You'an Agricultural Production Cooperative (formerly a mutual aid team) in Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui, which was awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, has successfully completed its spring fertilization, spring sowing, and spring water conservancy repair plans. This cooperative has a total of 345 mu of land. The original plan was to dredge 33,800 dan of pond mud to fertilize 260 mu of land. Now, more than 35,000 dan have been dredged, enough to fertilize more than 270 mu. The amount of spring manure accumulated also exceeded the original target by about one-fifth. Their spring sowing plan has also been completed on time. All of their ponds and dams have been repaired to standard quality, ensuring that they will not suffer from drought even if it does not rain for 80 consecutive days. In order to strive to overfulfill this year's bumper harvest plan, they decided to use the 2 million yuan bonus awarded to them by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to purchase an additional ox and a manure cart.
    ▲ In the mountainous areas of Western Sichuan Province, inhabited by Tibetans and Yi people, there are very few cattle for plowing. Although there are many mules and horses, they were only used as transportation in the past and never for plowing. Although the Yi and Han farmers in Xinxing Township owned more than 160 mules and horses, they had never used them for plowing. On March 17, the township held a production meeting, and the farmers generally reported that there was a shortage of cattle for plowing. Tan Zizhen, the district chief of the area, proposed the suggestion of using mules and horses for plowing. At first, the farmers did not believe that mules and horses could plow. After testing, it was found that using mules and horses for plowing only required imitating a North China-style harness for pulling a plow and a pair of iron rings. The mules and horses could be trained for two hours before they could be formally used for plowing. Moreover, the results of the experiment proved that plowing with mules and horses was twice as efficient as plowing with cattle. Now, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Western Sichuan Province is conducting further research and is preparing to promote it in minority areas.
    ▲ The Nangqian County People's Government of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province recently convened a meeting of tribal leaders of various ethnic groups to formulate this year's animal husbandry production increase plan. The plan stipulates that the county will implement measures this year such as prohibiting the slaughter of female livestock, protecting young livestock, and improving grazing and feeding methods, striving to reduce the mortality rate of young livestock from 50% to 30%. In this way, this year, 5,767 more calves and 15,146 more lambs can be produced. The meeting decided that pastures should be adjusted among various ethnic groups in a planned manner, and the leaders of various ethnic groups must organize herders to graze in more distant and cold alpine regions in summer, reserving nearby warm pastures for winter grazing.
    ▲ Bosteng Lake, a famous fish-producing area south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, has thawed, and local people of all ethnic groups have come out to fish. This year, the production of bighead, smallhead black fish, and fine-scaled white fish is particularly abundant. The largest fish weighs up to 200 jin, and the smallest fish weighs more than 2 jin. One net can catch at least about 300 fish a day.

    ▲受到中央人民政府农业部奖励的皖南宣城县李有安农业生产合作社（原为互助组）的农民已经胜利完成春季积肥、春播和水利春修计划。这个社共有田三百四十五亩，原计划捞塘泥三万三千八百担，肥田二百六十亩，现在已经捞好三万五千多担，可肥田二百七十多亩。春季积粪也超过了原定目标五分之一左右。他们的春播计划也已按时完成。他们的塘坝已经全数修好，工程质量都合标准，可以保证在连续八十天不下雨的情况下不受旱灾。为了争取超额完成今年的丰产计划，他们决定把中央人民政府农业部发给他们的二百万元奖金用来添买一头耕牛和一辆粪车。
    ▲西康省藏族、彝族聚居的山区耕牛都很少，骡马虽然很多，但过去骡马只当作交通工具，从来没有用来耕过地。新兴乡彝族、汉族农民虽拥有一百六十多头骡马，也没有用来耕过地。三月十七日该乡召开生产会议，农民普遍反映耕牛不足，该区区长谭子珍就提出用骡马耕地的建议。最初，农民都不相信骡马可以耕地，经过试验，用骡马耕地只需仿照华北做一个马拉犁的套子和一付铁环，将骡马训练两个多钟头即可正式耕地了。而且试验的结果证明：用骡马耕地比黄牛的效率还高两倍。现在，西康省农林厅正作进一步的研究，准备在少数民族地区推广。
    ▲青海省玉树藏族自治区囊谦县人民政府，最近召集各族部落头人开会，订出了今年的畜牧业增产计划。计划规定：全县今年实施禁宰母畜，保护幼畜，改善放牧和饲养方法等措施，争取幼畜死亡率由百分之五十减低到百分之三十。这样，今年就可增产牛犊五千七百六十七条，羊羔一万五千一百四十六只。会议决定：各族之间应有计划地调剂牧场，各族的头人在夏季必须组织牧民到较远的高寒地区放牧，保留近处暖地牧场，供冬季放牧。
    ▲新疆天山以南著名的鱼产区博斯腾湖已解冻，当地各族人民纷纷出动捕鱼。今年大头、小头黑鱼和细鳞白鱼等鱼产特别丰富，最大的鱼重达二百市斤，最小的鱼也在二市斤以上。一面网一天至少捕鱼三百条左右。
