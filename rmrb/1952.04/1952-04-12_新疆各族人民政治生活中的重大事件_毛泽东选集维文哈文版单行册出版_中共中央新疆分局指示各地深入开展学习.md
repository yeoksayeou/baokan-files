This is a major event in the political and cultural life of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

The Uyghur and Kazakh versions of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" single volumes are translated and published by the Xinjiang People's Publishing House based on the new version of Volume I of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," divided into separate articles.

The Mongolian version of the single volumes is also being rushed to print. In order to strengthen leadership over this work, the Xinjiang Bureau of the CPC Central Committee formed a "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Translation and Publication Committee in November last year, with Bao Erhan, Saifudin, and Deng Liqun serving as director and deputy directors respectively.

After these single volumes are distributed, opinions from readers will be widely solicited, studied and compiled to ensure the accuracy of the translations, and then the collected volumes will be published.
