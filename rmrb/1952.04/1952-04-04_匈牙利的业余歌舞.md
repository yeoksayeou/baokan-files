When I arrived in Budapest, it was just in time for the final special performance of twenty-three worker and peasant representative teams after the Hungarian national amateur art competition.

At dusk, the translator and I struggled through the crowd to squeeze into the open-air song and dance venue on Margaret Island in Budapest. Many people who had come from afar couldn't buy tickets and wished they could fly in. There were no dramas in the evening's program, only choruses and song and dance; each program lasted only twenty or thirty minutes. I can only record the general idea of ​​a few programs: A chorus of more than thirty miners, including rosy-cheeked young men and gray-bearded old men, all wearing black leather boots, white shirts, and black vests, were in high spirits. They sang a battle song of the Hungarian People's Armed Forces from the revolutionary era of 1848. I didn't inquire about the content of the lyrics, because just the melody alone was enough to be inspiring! A rural dance troupe performed the "Building a House" dance—initially a young couple came out singing and dancing, and then blacksmiths and bricklayers came, and everyone built a house and established a cooperative. Another song and dance troupe's program was called the "Wedding" dance, and the form was the same as a real event. The people watching the ceremony praised the bride and groom's exemplary labor in the agricultural cooperative in the lyrics. One program criticized those who were not actively selling agricultural products to the government and satirized reactionaries. There is also a program that must be mentioned, the famous "Bottle" dance: twenty-four girls wearing colorful skirts, each with a bottle on their hair tied with flower crowns, danced in ever-changing lines, light and lovely. This is a dance from ancient times when farmers in wine-producing areas celebrated the harvest, and the lyrics still retain simple lyrical content. In a word: each program has its own "magic"; after each performance, the audience cheered and applauded endlessly. The actors came out to bow but it wasn't enough, so they had to perform it again. …

Thanks to the help of the Press Department of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the day after watching this performance, I found Comrade Anna Baur, the director of the Dance Department of the Mass Art College, and talked with her about amateur song and dance and drama. She first told me that the national amateur art performance competition hosted by the Hungarian government's Ministry of Culture in the winter of 1950-1951 was a great review of mass culture and art revived in the socialist construction. In the preliminary stage at the district level, 4,000 song and dance troupes from 1,160 villages and towns participated, with more than 53,000 actors and actresses, and the audience exceeded one-twentieth of the national population. After county and state-level competitions, in March 1951, dozens of winning teams from rural areas, factories, and mines competed in the capital. This was once a sensational event in Hungarian cultural life.

During the competition, a large number of professional actors, music teachers, and students, as well as other artists, were assigned to various places to provide guidance. Not only did many fresh and lovely mass creations reflecting real life and struggle appear, but also folk songs and dances that had been forgotten or could only be remembered by the elderly were collected, enriched, and transformed. Moreover, countless talents were discovered from the various levels of competitions of these thousands of teams, and some were promoted to specialized art schools to study and become the new backbone of future mass art work.

Comrade Baur has participated in the judging and guidance of amateur art performances at all levels many times. She emphasized that professional artists have the obligation to provide the people's amateur performances with excellent scripts and songs. She often tells her students not to dream of being empty "musicians" or "dancers"... but to first go to the masses to teach singing and dancing, and at the same time learn from the masses. The mass amateur art activities are an important fuel for the new cultural revolutionary furnace, and new people will be smelted from it. Therefore, when judging people's amateur songs, dances, and dramas, the first requirement is to express patriotism from the sounds, appearance, movements, and stories, to express the people's positive, optimistic, healthy, and proud qualities, and to express their efforts to build a new socialist society and defend peace. However, this does not mean simply moving politics to the stage rigidly.

Later, in order to understand the organization and leadership of the people's amateur art activities that have spread to every corner of the country, I also visited the Vaz Town Cultural Club, seventy miles west of Budapest. The director of the department and the cultural commissioner of the district government took me to visit the various rooms. It is said that every afternoon and evening, especially on Sundays and holidays, the club becomes the "soul" of the town with a population of 20,000. According to the registration book, among the nearly 700 people who came to participate in cultural and artistic activities the day before (excluding those watching movies), in addition to those participating in science knowledge, radio repair, and Russian lectures, as well as chess and table tennis competitions, 48 people came to learn to sing, 55 people came to learn to dance, and dozens of people came to rehearse plays; the teachers were the club's professional staff (in addition to the director, one teaches music and dance, and one teaches acting).

Each of the twenty villages under the jurisdiction of Vaz Town has a cultural room, and about one-third of the village's population regularly and actively participates in amateur art activities. According to manpower, material resources, and financial resources, each village has a dance team, 17 villages have drama troupes, 4 villages have choirs, and 3 villages have orchestras. Dance is relatively easy to organize, so every village has it.

When amateur song and dance troupes are first established, costumes and props are generally borrowed. In public performances, especially in exchange performances between villages, the audience pays for tickets (except for free performances on holidays, tickets are generally required). The cultural commissioner explained that this can make the performers take their artistic activities seriously and try to make the income cover the expenses of the performance; and it is reasonable and willing for the audience to pay some money. In addition, according to the performance and development of a team, the central Ministry of Culture can provide subsidies for the purchase of equipment from the cultural undertakings funds through the cultural departments of the state and county. If a team wants to carry out unrealistic activities (such as rehearsing classic plays like the state and county professional touring troupes) and requests subsidies, it is extravagant and cannot be obtained. Of course, it is also necessary to prevent the amateur activities from changing their nature and being directed towards business, thereby delaying production; because amateur art activities are inseparable from improving the labor productivity of the working people. Facts have proved that workers and peasants who actively participate in cultural and artistic activities are the most active industrial and agricultural producers.

I asked the cultural commissioner, "Are there any rewards for these amateur actors and participants?" The cultural commissioner replied: "There are no material rewards, and they do not ask for material rewards, because they all have their own occupations and income. But there is a highest reward, that is the social reward—the praise and love of the masses for them. Generally speaking, the actors perform new things and new people, and they themselves are the creators of new things and new people." (This newspaper has slightly abridged the original text)

### 匈牙利的业余歌舞

    匈牙利的业余歌舞
    新华社驻布拉格记者　吴文焘
    我到布达佩斯的时候，正赶上匈牙利全国业余文艺比赛后二十三个工农代表团队的最后一场特别表演。
    黄昏时分，翻译员和我费了很大气力从人丛中挤进布达佩斯马格特岛的露天歌舞场。很多远从外地来的人买不到票，恨不得插翅飞过去。当晚的节目里没有戏剧，只是合唱和歌舞；每个节目都不过二三十分钟。我只能记下几个节目的大意：一个合唱队的三十多个矿工，包括红光满面的小伙子和灰白胡子的老者，一律穿黑皮靴、白衬衣和黑坎肩，仪表昂然。他们唱的是一段一八四八年革命时代匈牙利人民武装的战歌。我没有打听歌词的内容，因为单只它的调子，就够使人振奋了！一个农村舞蹈团表演的是“盖房”舞——最初一对青年男女出来且歌且舞，以后铁匠、瓦匠都来了，大家就盖了房子，成立了合作社。另一个歌舞团的节目叫“婚礼”舞，形式和真事一样，观礼的人们在唱词中赞扬新郎新娘在农业合作社的模范劳动。有一个节目是批评不积极向政府缴售农产品和讽刺反动分子的。还有一个节目是必须提一下的有名的“酒瓶”舞：二十四个穿着彩裙的少女，在束着花冠的头发上各顶着一个酒瓶，跳着瞬息万变的行列，轻巧可爱。这是自古以来产酒区农民庆祝丰收的舞蹈，歌词里还保存着朴素的抒情的内容。一句话：每个节目都有着它的“魔力”；每次完场后观众欢呼鼓掌不息，演员们出来行了礼还不行，只好再表演一次。……
    感谢匈牙利外交部新闻司的帮助，我在看了这场表演的第二天，找到群众文艺学院舞蹈系的主任安娜·包尔同志，和她谈了一些有关业余歌舞和戏剧的问题。她首先告诉我：一九五○—五一年冬季，匈牙利政府文化部主持的全国业余文艺演出比赛，是在建设社会主义的国土上复活了的群众文化艺术的一次大检阅。在区级的初赛阶段，有一千一百六十个村庄和市镇的四千个歌舞剧团参加，演员五万三千多人，观众超过全国人口的二十分之一。经过县和州级的比赛后，一九五一年三月，几十个从农村、工厂、矿山来的优胜团队，就在首都决赛了。这曾经是匈牙利文化生活中轰动一时的大事件。
    在比赛期间，大批职业演员、音乐教师和学生，以及其他文艺工作者，被分派到各地去指导，不仅很多反映现实生活和斗争的、新鲜可爱的群众创作出现了，就是已被遗忘了的、或者只有老年人才能记得的民间歌舞，也被收集起来，加以充实改造。而且，无数的天才，就从这几千个团队的各级比赛中被发现出来，一部分并被提拔到专门文艺学校去学习，成为未来群众文艺工作的新骨干。
    包尔同志有很多次参加了各级业余文艺表演赛的评判和指导工作。她强调指出职业文艺工作者有供给人民业余表演以优良脚本和歌曲的义务。她常常告诉她的学生们不要幻想做空头的“音乐家”、“舞蹈家”……，而要首先到群众中去教歌舞，同时向群众学习。群众的业余文艺活动，是新的文化革命洪炉的一种重要燃料，新的人将要从其中冶炼出来。因之，在判断人民业余的歌舞和戏剧时，首先就要求从声音、仪表、动作和故事中，表现爱国主义，表现人民积极、乐观、健康、自豪的品质，表现他们为建设社会主义新社会、保卫和平的努力。但，这并不是说生硬地把政治搬上舞台来。
    以后，为了了解普及到全国每个角落的人民业余文艺活动的组织和领导，我还访问过布达佩斯以西七十里的瓦兹镇文化俱乐部。该部的主任和区政府的文化委员曾带着我到各室参观。据说每天下午到晚间，特别是星期日和假日，俱乐部就成了这两万人口的市镇的“灵魂”。从登记簿上看，先一天来参加文艺活动的近七百人中（不包括看电影的），除科学常识、无线电修理和俄文讲座，以及下棋、乒乓赛等的参加者外，有四十八人来学唱歌，五十五人来学跳舞，还有几十个人来排戏；教员就是俱乐部的专业职员（除了主任外，一个教音乐和舞蹈，一个教演戏）。
    瓦兹镇管辖的二十个村庄，每村都有文化室，经常积极参加业余文艺活动的，约占村里人口的三分之一。按照人力、物力、财力，每村都有跳舞队，十七个村有剧团，四个村有合唱队，三个村有乐队。舞蹈是比较容易组织的，所以每村都有。
    业余歌舞剧团刚成立时，服装道具一般都靠筹借。在公演，特别是各村交换演出中，观众都出点票钱（除节日公演免费外，一般需要买票）。文化委员解释说：这一方面可以使演出者严肃对待自己的文艺活动，并尽量使收入能弥补演出中的开支；而观众出点钱，也是合理的和乐意的。另外，按照一个团队的成绩和发展，中央文化部可以经过州、县的文化部门，从文化事业费中给以购置设备的津贴。如果一个团队要进行不切实际的活动（例如照着州、县的职业巡回剧团那样排演古典大戏）而要求津贴，那就是铺张浪费，无法取得。当然，将业余的活动变了质、导向营业以致耽误生产，也是要防止的；因为业余的文艺活动是与提高劳动人民的生产不可分的。事实证明：积极参加文艺活动的工人和农民。正是最积极的工农业生产者。
    我问文化委员说：“对于这些业余演员和参加者，可有什么报酬吗？”文化委员回答说：“没有物质报酬，他们也不要求物质报酬，因为他们都有自己的职业和收入。但有一个最高的报酬，那就是社会的报酬——群众对于他们的赞誉和爱戴。一般说，演员们表演新的事物、新的人，他们自己也就是新的事物的创造者和新的人了。”（本报对原文略有删节）（附图片）
