    I am Confident in Leading Production Work Well
    Li Dazhi, Deputy Director of the Construction Section, Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau
    When I was the director of the construction office of the construction section of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, unscrupulous merchants constantly attacked me. But I remembered that the Party often educated me: "Communist Party members must always be vigilant against the erosion of corrupt ideas and must withstand the test of the urban environment." Zhang Yuefa, a mole of the bourgeoisie, seeing that I didn't take the bait of the unscrupulous merchants, organized them to attack me from both inside and outside, and incited the masses to attack me. I did not waver in the slightest. During the "Three-Anti" movement, under the leadership of the Party, we arrested the mole Zhang Yue; I was honorably promoted to deputy director of the construction section, and I felt that my responsibilities were greater and the difficulties were more numerous. But I am not afraid. I thought that we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and I have the strength to overcome difficulties.
    When I was assigned to lead production work, I thought, "How can I do a good job in production?" I thought about it when I was lying on the kang, when I was eating, and when I was walking with my comrades. I thought that first I must reorganize the disrupted organization. According to the nature of the work, I changed the construction, material, and accounting offices into seven production teams, and decided to appoint excellent cadres as team leaders. After the organization was determined, I convened a mobilization meeting for the entire section and a joint meeting of team leaders to study the center of current work and the steps to complete the work. After the meeting, each team launched discussions to review whether the workload was in line with the requirements of the superiors; then each team and each person formulated a specific plan, and the daily plan must be completed every day. In this way, the intentions of the superiors were implemented among the masses. Through the "Three-Anti," everyone's awareness has been raised, and the work is easier to do. For example, the comrades of Meng Guoshi's production team took the initiative to understand the project situation along the line and formulated a realistic and feasible daily plan. When the material team was formulating a work plan, they also calculated how much time it would take to record an entry. With a plan for each team, the past blind and chaotic phenomenon was corrected.
    Although I have done construction work in the past, I am not familiar with material work. Therefore, I went to the material team to learn from my comrades. The comrades sincerely helped us, which gave me confidence.
    When I was discussing work with my comrades, I found that some comrades were unwilling to make work plans. They said, "It takes too much time to make plans." After understanding this incorrect idea, I explained to everyone the principle that work must be planned. Now everyone is willing to make plans.
    I know that after the "Three-Anti" movement, our country will usher in a new high tide of economic construction. Therefore, we are actively preparing to do a good job in future capital construction work. When celebrating the great "May Day" International Labor Day, I believe that we will definitely build a strong and industrialized New China.

### 我有信心把生产工作领导好

    我有信心把生产工作领导好
    太原铁路分局建筑段副段长  李大志
    我担任太原铁路分局建筑段建筑室主任的时候，奸商曾不断地向我进攻。但我记得党时常教育我：“共产党员要时刻警惕腐化思想的侵蚀，要经得起城市环境的考验。”资产阶级的坐探张悦发见我没有上奸商的“钩”，就组织奸商内外夹攻我，并且挑拨群众打击我。我丝毫也不动摇。在“三反”运动中，我们在党的领导下逮捕了坐探张悦；我被光荣地提升为建筑段副段长，我感到自己的责任更大了，困难更多了。但我不畏惧，我想到我们有毛主席，有共产党，我就有了克服困难的力量。
    当我被分配领导生产工作时，我想着：“怎样把生产搞好呢？”我躺在炕上时想，吃饭时想，和同志们在一起走路也想。我想到，首先必须把打乱了的机构另行组织起来，根据工作的性质，把建筑、材料、会计三个室，改成七个生产小组，并决定以优秀的干部当小组长。确定了机构以后，我召开了全段的动员大会、小组长联席会议，研究了当前工作的中心和完成工作的步骤。会后，各小组又展开讨论，审查工作量是不是和上级的要求对头；然后各小组、各人都订出具体计划，每天必须完成每天的计划。这样，就使得上级的意图贯彻到群众中去了。通过“三反”，大家的觉悟提高了，工作也好做了。比如，孟国士的生产小组的同志们主动到沿线了解工程情况，订出切实可行的日计划。材料小组订工作计划时，还计算了登一笔帐需要多少时间。每个小组有了计划，就纠正了过去那种盲目的混乱的现象。
    我过去虽然做过建筑工作，但对材料工作是不熟悉的。因此，我就到材料小组去向同志们学习。同志们诚恳地帮助我们，使我有了信心。
    当我和同志们研究工作时，我发现有些同志不愿意做工作计划。他们说：“订计划太费时间。”我了解了这种不正确的思想，就向大家解释工作必须有计划的道理。现在大家也都乐意订计划了。
    我知道，“三反”运动以后，我们国家将要出现一个经济建设的新高潮。因此，我们正积极地做着准备工作，以便做好今后的基本建设工作。在庆祝伟大的“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我相信我们一定能建设一个强大的工业化的新中国。
