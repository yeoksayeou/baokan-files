    Mentougou Industrial and Commercial Newspaper Agency Should Improve Newspaper Delivery Work
    The Mentougou Industrial and Commercial Newspaper Agency is very irresponsible. We often cannot receive the newspapers and periodicals we subscribe to from this store on time. The newspaper deliverymen of this agency lack a sense of responsibility and often do not deliver the newspapers to subscribers themselves, but instead ask others to deliver them, which often results in the newspapers being lost. Since Liberation, the Industrial and Commercial Newspaper Agency has always asked subscribers for gifts during the New Year and other festivals. If gifts are not given, newspapers will not be delivered on time. This practice is very bad. The leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Newspaper Agency must conduct a self-criticism in order to improve their work.

    门头沟工商书报社应改进书报递送工作
    门头沟工商书报社是非常不负责任的。我们在该店订阅的书报，时常不能按时收到。该社送报员缺乏责任感，往往不亲自把报纸送给订户，而交别人带捎，以致报纸常常失落。解放以来，每过年节，工商书报社都要向订户索取礼物，如不送礼，就不按时送报，这种作风是非常恶劣的。工商书报社领导人必须进行检讨，以期改进自己的工作。
