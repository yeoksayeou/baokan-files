    To commemorate the second anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Chinese Changchun Railway Company, the Council and Supervisory Board of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company, the Chinese Changchun Railway Administration, and the Political Department, Trade Union, and New Democratic Youth League of the Changchun Railway District, held a grand celebration meeting at the Harbin Railway Culture Hall on April 26th. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, Lu Xi, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Li Youwen, representative of the Northeast People's Government, Rao Bin, representative of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government, Wang Xuezeng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, and Dobashin, Soviet Consul General in Harbin, all went to offer their congratulations. Representatives from railway bureaus across the country also rushed to participate; fifty advanced workers from the Chinese Changchun Railway also attended the meeting.
    Yelokogov, Chairman of the Council of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company, summarized the work of the Chinese Changchun Railway over the past two years at the meeting. He pointed out that, over the past two years, thanks to learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in managing railway enterprises and advanced technical experience, as well as the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet railway workers, the labor productivity of the Chinese Changchun Railway has increased significantly, and costs have been greatly reduced. In 1951, despite having a large volume of freight and a shortage of vehicles, as well as encountering unprecedented floods and rare severe cold, the Chinese Changchun Railway completed its transportation tasks 23 days ahead of schedule, completing 107.2% of the annual plan. Labor productivity in 1951 increased by 27.8% compared to 1950, expenditures were reduced by more than 72.3 billion yuan compared to the plan, vehicle turnover was accelerated by 2.4% compared to the plan, and profits exceeded the plan by 1 trillion yuan. The living standards and labor welfare of employees have also been significantly improved accordingly. He also pointed out that the reason why all employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway have been able to gloriously and combatively achieve such great accomplishments is mainly due to the brotherly friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway; the implementation of advanced Soviet methods and production technologies in labor organization; and the promotion of the experience of advanced Chinese railway workers; it is also due to the assistance of the Political Department, Trade Union, and New Democratic Youth League of the Chinese Changchun Railway, who organized extensive patriotic labor competitions to complete the production and financial plans. Next, Yu Guangsheng, Vice Chairman of the Council of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company, gave a report. In his report, he emphasized the great help given by Soviet experts in enabling the Chinese Changchun Railway to complete its production and financial plans ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment in the second year, as well as in training a large number of Chinese cadres. He pointed out that the Chinese Changchun Railway encountered many difficulties in transportation and finance in the second year, and Soviet experts made great contributions to solving these difficulties. He called on all Chinese employees to intensify their efforts to learn from Soviet experts and to implement the experience learned in their work. He pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to concentrate efforts, ensure the overfulfillment of the vehicle loading plan, practice strict economy, eradicate corruption and waste, and launch new labor competitions to welcome the arrival of the high tide of national economic construction. After Chen Tan, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company, delivered a speech, Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways, on behalf of the Central People's Government, offered congratulations to the conference. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet experts who embodied the great friendship and assistance of the Soviet people and Marshal Stalin, and extended cordial greetings to all the hardworking employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway. Lu Xi, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Li Youwen, representative of the Northeast People's Government, successively delivered congratulatory messages to the conference. Then, advanced workers Li Xikui, Zheng Xikun, and Yu Shufen spoke, unanimously expressing their gratitude to the enthusiastic help of the Soviet experts. Liu Juying, Director of the Chinese Changchun Railway Administration, and Glonichev, Deputy Director, delivered replies. During the conference, the conference continuously received news from employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway in various places using practical actions to celebrate the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company. For example, the Zhang Xianting chartered vehicle group No. 884 in the Manzhouli area, in order to celebrate the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Changchun Railway Company, pulled 3,848 tons on a 5.2‰ slope, setting a new record for climbing over-axle weight. The conference finally unanimously adopted congratulatory telegrams to Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Transportation, the Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, and Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government.

    铁道部滕代远部长代表中央人民政府向大会致贺
    中国长春铁路公司理事会、监事会，中长铁路管理局和中长区铁路政治部、工会、新民主主义青年团，四月二十六日在哈尔滨铁路文化馆举行隆重庆祝大会，纪念中苏合办的中国长春铁路公司成立两周年。中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远、中央人民政府外交部代表陆曦、东北人民政府代表栗又文、松江省人民政府代表饶斌、中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席王学增、苏联驻哈尔滨总领事道巴申等都前往祝贺。全国各铁路局也都派代表赶来参加；参加大会的并有五十名中长铁路先进工作者。
    中国长春铁路公司理事会主席叶洛果夫在会上总结了中长铁路两年来的工作，他指出：两年来中国长春铁路由于学习了苏联先进经营管理铁路企业的经验和先进技术的经验以及中苏两国铁路职工共同努力，劳动生产率显著增长，成本大大降低。一九五一年度中长铁路在货多车少并遭遇了空前水害和稀有严寒的情况下，提前二十三天完成运输任务，全年完成计划的百分之一百零七点二。一九五一年的劳动生产率比一九五○年提高了百分之二十七点八，支出较计划节省七百二十三亿余元，车辆周转比计划加速百分之二点四，利润超计划一万亿元。职工生活水平和劳动福利也适应地获得显著提高。他又指出：中长铁路全体职工所以能光荣地、战斗地获得这样伟大的成就，主要是中长铁路中苏职工间兄弟般的友好合作；在劳动组织中推行了苏联先进方法和生产技术；并且推行了中国先进铁路职工的经验；同时也由于中长铁路政治部、工会、新民主主义青年团的帮助，他们为完成生产财务计划而组织了广泛的爱国主义劳动竞赛。接着，由中长铁路公司理事会副主席余光生报告。他在报告中着重指出苏联专家对于中长铁路第二年度能提前和超额完成生产财务计划，以及大量培养中国干部工作所给予的帮助是很大的。他指出：中长铁路第二年度中，在运输、财务方面所遇到的困难很多，苏联专家对解决这些困难有着巨大的贡献。他号召全体中国职工要加紧向苏联专家学习，并把学得的经验贯彻到工作中去。他指出：今后必须集中力量，保证超额完成装车计划，厉行节约，根绝贪污浪费，开展新的劳动竞赛，迎接国家经济建设高潮的到来。中国长春铁路公司监事会主席陈坦致词后，铁道部滕代远部长代表中央人民政府向大会致贺。他对体现着苏联人民和斯大林大元帅的伟大友谊和帮助的苏联专家致衷心的谢意，并向中长铁路全体辛勤劳动的员工致亲切的慰问。外交部代表陆曦、东北人民政府代表栗又文相继向大会致贺词。接着先进工作者李锡奎、郑锡坤、于淑芬讲话，一致感谢苏联专家的热诚帮助。中长铁路管理局长刘居英、副局长格洛尼切夫致答词。在会议过程中，大会不断接到中长铁路各地职工以实际行动来庆祝中国长春铁路公司成立二周年的消息。如满洲里地区八八四号张显亭包车组，为了庆祝中长铁路公司成立二周年纪念，在千分之五点二的坡道上拉了三千八百四十八吨，创爬坡超轴的新纪录。大会最后一致通过了给斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席、苏联交通部部长、中央人民政府铁道部部长、东北人民政府高岗主席的致敬电。（新华社）
