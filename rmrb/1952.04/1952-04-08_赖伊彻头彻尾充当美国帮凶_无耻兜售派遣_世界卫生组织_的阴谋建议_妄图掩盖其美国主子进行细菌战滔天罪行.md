Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: United Nations Secretary-General Lie, after shamelessly sending a telegram to the governments of China and Korea on March 20th, claiming that "the World Health Organization is willing to contribute technical assistance in preventing the rumored epidemic infectious diseases in North Korea," sent two more telegrams to the governments of China and Korea on March 27th and April 3rd, brazenly repeatedly proposing conspiracy suggestions regarding so-called "technical assistance" from the "World Health Organization" and eagerly requesting a "prompt reply" to his telegrams. At a time when the people of the world are unanimously condemning, angrily protesting, and demanding severe punishment for the towering crime of bacteriological warfare committed by the American aggressors, Lie has defied the world's condemnation by repeatedly shamelessly peddling the suggestions dictated by his American master, attempting to confuse the world's people and cover up the crimes of the American aggressors. This despicable and base behavior once again confirms that Lie has completely become a tool and accomplice of American aggression.

It is not at all surprising that United Nations Secretary-General Lie is so enthusiastic and loyal in serving American imperialism. A brief review of Lie's recent two years of criminal records within the United Nations will clearly show that Lie has consistently been acting within the United Nations as an obedient slave to the United States.

Since the American aggressors launched the unjust war of aggression against Korea, Lie has completely disregarded the United Nations Charter and its responsibilities, thoroughly acting as a tool and accomplice of the United States and openly antagonizing the people of China and Korea. Lie has been an active supporter of the war of aggression against Korea from the beginning. The day after the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea (June 26, 1950), when the American armed intervention troops were preparing to move, Lie blatantly advocated in a radio speech for this aggressive measure by the United States, saying in advance that if the United Nations Security Council "can have troops at its disposal, then it can appropriately use these troops when the North Korean regime does not comply with the armistice order of the Council." The next day, after the Security Council, under the control of the United States, illegally passed the American proposal requiring United Nations member states to intervene militarily in the Korean civil war, Lie not only obediently and quickly sent this illegal resolution to the United Nations member states but also abused the authority of the United Nations Secretary-General by arbitrarily requesting in his notification that the member states indicate what kind of "assistance" they would provide to "support" the illegal resolution of the Security Council. People will also not forget that when the American aggressors stole the name of the United Nations to form the so-called "United Nations Forces," Lie held a shameful "flag-raising ceremony," causing the United Nations flag with olive branches to be eclipsed and become a fig leaf for American imperialism's armed intervention in Korea.

Such loyal service from a slave clearly won the appreciation of the master. Therefore, when Lie's term as United Nations Secretary-General expired on February 1, 1951, American imperialism disregarded everything, violated the United Nations Charter, and illegally forced Lie to be re-elected at the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations. From then on, Lie served his American master even more docilely and shamelessly.

In February 1951, the United States hijacked the United Nations to pass the shameful proposal slandering China as an "aggressor." Lie openly applauded and echoed this, issuing a statement on February 16th of the same year, echoing the words of American representative Austin, and reversing right and wrong to slander the Korean and Chinese People's forces as "troops carrying out armed aggression." Not only that, Lie consistently obstructed China's attendance at the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations and then shamelessly issued a statement on September 7, 1951, threatening that "as long as the Korean War continues, there is no question of allowing the CCP regime to participate in this world organization (referring to the United Nations)."

What is particularly outrageous is that since the American aggressors have been carrying out the heinous bacteriological warfare, despite the fact that the United Nations Secretariat has received a "large number" of protests against "America's 'bacteriological warfare' in Korea" (Agence France-Presse, New York, March 20th), Lie not only turned a deaf ear but also shamelessly lied on March 19th, saying that the accusations made by Soviet representative to the United Nations Disarmament Committee, Malik, regarding the American army's bacteriological warfare in Korea "are all false."

Do these series of shameful acts of Lie still qualify him to be called the "United Nations Secretary-General"? Isn't he just a complete "chief attendant of Wall Street"?

It can be seen from this that the purpose of such a loyal servant of the United States in repeatedly suggesting that the "World Health Organization" provide so-called "technical assistance" is clearly to cover up the crime of the United States in carrying out bacteriological warfare and to try to collect information about the effects of bacteriological warfare for the United States. Can there still be any doubt about this?

In fact, Lie's suggestion itself precisely confirms this shameful attempt. What exactly is this "World Health Organization" that Lie has proposed? This "World Health Organization" is precisely a specialized agency of the United Nations that has already become a tool of American aggression. On October 24, 1950, the then Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, Rusk, said: "We are the United Nations. There is no great organization at Lake Success. When we refer to the United Nations, we are referring to ourselves." As for the "World Health Organization" itself, its predecessor was the Health Department of the infamous "League of Nations," and it inherited part of the work of the Health Division of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA for short). The "League of Nations" was an instrument of imperialist aggression, and the verdict has already been finalized. As for the history of the crimes of "UNRRA," the Chinese people also have fresh memories. The Chinese branch of "UNRRA" was actually an American imperialist organization for invading China throughout its entire existence and was also a blood transfusion tube for funding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in carrying out the anti-people's war, while the people in the Chinese liberated areas basically did not receive the so-called relief supplies. The current "World Health Organization" is essentially the same as its predecessor, an organization under the control of the United States that conducts espionage activities in the name of "health." The Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and other countries, dissatisfied with its criminal activities, announced their withdrawal from 1949 onwards. Since then, this organization has been unscrupulously used by the United States to incite war hysteria and promote bacteriological warfare. Its ugly face of hostility towards the Chinese people has long been exposed. In March 1951, in order to support the American embargo on China, the Singapore epidemic station under the jurisdiction of the "World Health Organization" fabricated notifications of China's "epidemic" four times in succession, ridiculously declaring all Chinese ports as "plague ports." At the same time, the organization's Canadian chairman, Chisholm, is also a notorious advocate of bacteriological warfare. He made a speech on September 9, 1949, arguing that germ weapons were superior to atomic weapons. On October 13 of the same year, he shamelessly touted the "power" of germ weapons at a press conference at Lake Success. What is particularly absurd is that there is no epidemic in China and Korea. What there is is the bacteria spread by the United States. Yet this "World Health Organization" insists on echoing Acheson's words and saying that it wants to provide "assistance" for the epidemic. Isn't this completely to investigate the effects of bacteriological warfare for the United States? Providing "technical assistance" with such an organization and such a person in charge is tantamount to asking the arsonist's accomplice to put out the fire. Apart from wanting to loot while the fire is burning, what other good intentions can there be?

Lie's despicable conspiracy of proposing, under the orders of the United States, to use the so-called "World Health Organization" to collect intelligence by providing "technical assistance" has already been inadvertently revealed by the propaganda agency of the American army invading Korea, "Voice of the United Nations." It broadcast on March 24 that: "The most necessary step is to investigate the situation to determine whether the epidemic exists, to determine which diseases are included in the epidemic, and to decide what kind of assistance can be carried out to extinguish these epidemics." As long as we compare the confession of Han Zhengyu, a Korean-born American airborne special agent who recently surrendered, we will find that the "most necessary step" for the "World Health Organization" to "provide assistance" stipulated by the American aggressors is completely consistent with the mission given by the United States to Han Zhengyu and other American airborne special agents sent to North Korea to investigate the effects of bacteriological warfare. The matter is already very clear that Lie's suggestion is precisely part of the American plan to collect information about the effects of bacteriological warfare. Under the command of the American aggressors, the "World Health Organization" will undertake the same shameful task as the American airborne special agents who are falling into the net one after another.

The American aggressors instructed Lie to bring out this rotten signboard of the "World Health Organization" after their own conspiracy to have the "International Committee of the Red Cross" "investigate" was exposed. However, this is only another futile attempt by the American aggressors and their accomplices. The towering crime of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare will inevitably be punished by justice. The likes of Lie, who serve the American aggressors, will inevitably not escape the serious guilt of acting as accomplices to aggression.

### 赖伊彻头彻尾充当美国帮凶  无耻兜售派遣“世界卫生组织”的阴谋建议  妄图掩盖其美国主子进行细菌战滔天罪行

    赖伊彻头彻尾充当美国帮凶
    无耻兜售派遣“世界卫生组织”的阴谋建议
    妄图掩盖其美国主子进行细菌战滔天罪行
    【新华社七日讯】联合国秘书长赖伊，于三月二十日致电我国政府和朝鲜政府无耻声称“世界卫生组织愿在防止传闻中之北朝鲜流行性传染病工作中贡献技术上的援助”之后，又于三月二十七日和四月三日两次致电中朝两国政府，厚颜无耻地一再提出关于由所谓“世界卫生组织”提供“技术援助”的阴谋建议，并迫不及待地要求对他的电报予以“迅速答复”。当此全世界人民对美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，一致口诛笔伐、愤怒抗议并要求严惩美国细菌战犯的时候，赖伊竟冒天下之大不韪，一再为其美国主子授意的建议无耻兜售，妄图混淆世界人民的耳目，掩盖美国侵略者的罪行。这种卑鄙下贱的行径，再次证实了赖伊已完全变成了美国的侵略工具和帮凶。
    联合国秘书长赖伊如此热心、如此忠实地为美帝国主义服务，这是丝毫不足为怪的。只要略为查阅一下赖伊在联合国内最近两年来的罪恶纪录，人们就会清楚地知道：原来赖伊是一贯以美国百依百顺的奴才的身份在联合国内进行活动的。
    自从美国侵略者发动侵略朝鲜的不义战争以来，赖伊完全置联合国宪章及其职责于脑后，彻头彻尾地充当美国的工具和帮凶，和朝中两国人民公开为敌。赖伊自始就是侵朝战争的积极支持者。在侵朝战争爆发后的第二天（一九五○年六月二十六日）当美国武装干涉军升火待发的时候，赖伊在广播演说中明目张胆地为美国这一侵略措施事先鼓吹说：如果联合国安全理事会“能有听其支配的军队，那么在北朝鲜政权不服从该会的停战令时，它就可以适当地使用这些部队”。次日，在安理会在美国的把持下非法通过要求联合国各会员国武装干涉朝鲜内战的美国提案以后，赖伊不但卑顺地迅速将这一非法决议送达联合国各会员国，同时并滥用联合国秘书长的职权，在其通知中擅自要求各会员国表明以何种“援助”来“支持”安理会的非法决议。人们也不会忘记，当美国侵略者盗窃名义组成所谓“联合国军”的时候，赖伊曾举行了可耻的“授旗仪式”，使绘有橄榄枝的联合国旗黯然失色，成为美帝国主义进行武装干涉朝鲜的遮羞布。
    奴才如此忠心服务，显然博得了主人的赏识，因此当赖伊的联合国秘书长的任期在一九五一年二月一日届满时，美帝国主义竟不顾一切地破坏联合国宪章，在联合国第五届大会中非法地硬使赖伊连任。从此以后，赖伊便更加驯顺和更加无耻地为美国主子效劳。
    一九五一年二月，美国劫持联合国通过诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的可耻提案，赖伊对此公然鼓掌附合，他在同年二月十六日发表声明，学着美国代表奥斯汀的舌头，颠倒是非地诬蔑朝中人民部队为“实行武装侵略的军队”。不仅如此，赖伊还一贯阻挠我国出席联合国第五届大会，后来又在一九五一年九月七日无耻地发表声明威胁说：“只要朝鲜战争继续下去，就谈不上允许中共政权参加这个世界组织（按指联合国）。”
    尤其令人发指的是自从美国侵略者进行万恶的细菌战以来，尽管联合国秘书处已经接到“大批”对于“美国在朝鲜进行‘细菌战’的抗议书”（法新社纽约三月二十日电），赖伊不但置若罔闻，反而在三月十九日无耻地撒谎说：苏联出席联合国裁减军备委员会代表马立克提出的美国军队在朝鲜进行细菌战的指责“都是假的”。
    赖伊这一连串的可耻的行径，难道还配称什么“联合国秘书长”吗？他难道还不是十足的“华尔街的侍从长”吗？
    由此可见，美国这样一个忠实仆从再三建议由“世界卫生组织”提供所谓“技术援助”，其目的显然是为了掩盖美国进行细菌战的罪行，并设法为美国收集有关细菌战效果的情报，这难道还能有丝毫怀疑的余地吗？
    其实，赖伊建议的本身，恰恰证实了这一可耻的企图。赖伊所提出的“世界卫生组织”究竟是一个什么东西呢？这个“世界卫生组织”正是已经成为美国的侵略工具的联合国的一个专门机构。一九五○年十月二十四日，当时的美国助理国务卿鲁斯克曾经说过：“我们就是联合国。在成功湖并没有甚么伟大的组织。当我们指联合国时，那就是指我们自己。”就“世界卫生组织”本身来说，它的前身是遗臭万年的“国际联盟”的卫生部，并且继承了“联合国救济复兴总署”（简称“联总”）的卫生处的一部分工作。“国际联盟”是帝国主义的侵略工具，已经盖棺论定。至于“联总”的罪恶史，中国人民也记忆犹新。“联总”中国分署在其整个存在时期，实际上就是美帝国主义的侵华机关，也是资助蒋介石匪帮进行反人民的战争的输血管，而当时中国解放区的人民基本上没有获得所谓救济物资。现在的“世界卫生组织”本质上和它的前身一模一样，是一个以“卫生”为名义，进行间谍性活动的美国操纵下的组织。苏联、保加利亚等国家早因不满它的罪恶活动，从一九四九年起纷纷宣告退出。此后这个组织即被美国肆无忌惮地用来煽动战争歇斯底里和鼓吹细菌战。它的敌视中国人民的丑恶面目，也早就暴露出来了。在一九五一年三月，为了支持美国对中国的禁运，“世界卫生组织”所管辖的新加坡疫情站曾先后四次捏造我国“疫情”的通报，荒唐无稽地宣布我国全部港口为“疫港”。同时，这个组织的加拿大籍主席齐修姆，更是一个臭名昭著的细菌战鼓吹者。他曾在一九四九年九月九日发表演说，争辩什么细菌武器比原子武器优越。同年十月十三日，他在成功湖的一次记者招待会上又厚颜无耻地吹嘘细菌武器的“威力”。尤其荒唐的是，在中朝两国并没有什么疫情，有的是美国所散布的细菌。而这个“世界卫生组织”却偏要学着艾奇逊的舌头，说要来对疫情提供“援助”。这不完全是要替美国来调查细菌战的效果么？以这样的组织和这样的负责人来提供什么“技术援助”，无异是要纵火者的帮凶去救火。这除了想乘火打劫以外，还能有什么别的善良的目的吗？
    赖伊奉美国之命提议以所谓“世界卫生组织”利用提供“技术援助”来收集情报的卑鄙阴谋，早已由侵朝美军的宣传机构“联合国之音”不小心地透露了。它在三月二十四日广播说；“最必要的步骤是调查情况以断定疫病是否存在，断定疫病中有那些疾病包含在内，以及可以决定可以进行何种援助以扑灭这些疫病。”我们只要对照一下最近自首的朝鲜籍美国空降特务韩正玉的供词，就会发现美国侵略者所规定的“世界卫生组织”的“提供援助”的“最必要的步骤”，是和它交给韩正玉及其他派往朝鲜北部调查细菌战效果的美国空降特务的使命，完全一致。事情已经十分明白，赖伊的建议正是美国企图收集有关细菌战效果的情报的计划的一部分，在美国侵略者的指挥之下，“世界卫生组织”将负起与纷纷落网的美国空降特务相同的可耻任务。
    美国侵略者是在它自己出面提出的由“红十字国际委员会”“调查”的阴谋诡计被揭穿以后，授意赖伊把“世界卫生组织”这一块烂招牌捧出来的。但是，这也只是美国侵略者及其帮凶的又一次枉费心机而已。美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，必将受到正义的惩罚。为美国侵略者效劳的赖伊之流，也必然不能逃脱其充当侵略帮凶的严重罪责。
