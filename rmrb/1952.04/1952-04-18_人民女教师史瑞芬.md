    People's Female Teacher Shi Ruifen
    Bai Yuan
    Comrade Kalinin once said at a meeting of outstanding urban and rural teachers convened by the editorial department of the Soviet "Teacher's Newspaper": "A true teacher is not only to be made, but also to be born." He meant that a true teacher should not only be proficient in the teaching profession but also possess noble qualities that are respected and emulated by people. Shi Ruifen, an outstanding female teacher in New China, is such a people's teacher with noble qualities.
    Although Shi Ruifen is a young female teacher, the oppression she suffered in the old society and the arduous work she has done in the two years since liberation have made her appear so firm, enthusiastic, and experienced. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, although she had attended several free normal schools and graduated from them, the education she received was the torment that dark society inflicted on her. Not long before liberation, because her family owed money to an uncle, the uncle's wife acted as a matchmaker and married her to a man to earn money to offset her family's debt. Because the two could not live together, she divorced a few months after the marriage and returned home to suffer unemployment and poverty.
    After the liberation of Shi Ruifen's hometown—Daibu Town, Liyang County, Southern Jiangsu—in the winter of 1949, she went to the winter school teacher training class held by the county. The training lasted only ten days. In such a short time, it was impossible for Shi Ruifen to learn a lot, but she learned one important thing in these ten days: how to be a people's teacher. Understanding how to be a people's teacher does not take long for someone willing to dedicate everything to the people. In these ten days of study, Shi Ruifen understood the meaning of the title of people's teacher. As soon as the winter school teacher training class ended, she returned to her hometown of Daibu Town to run a winter school. She worked diligently in the windy and snowy weather, demonstrating her qualities as a people's teacher from the very beginning. In early April 1950, the county people's government sent her to work in a remote small village called Qingshuitang, thirty miles northwest of Liyang City, Southern Jiangsu. This was a poor little village with 76 peasant households, of which poor and hired peasants accounted for 70. They rented the landlords' land, and the soil was very poor. In addition, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past, various natural and man-made disasters occurred year after year. Some young peasants felt hopeless about life in those painful days, had no interest in production, and gradually developed various bad habits. As a result, there were eighteen idlers in the village. Out of a total of 460 people in the village, only ten were slightly literate, and the rest were all illiterate. In the past, although there was a primary school in the village, the principal was a person who spent all day drinking and sleeping in. The school building was a dilapidated ancestral hall without even a door panel. The blackboard and desks were also incomplete. There were only a dozen students in the school. After liberation, the people's government replaced this principal and let Shi Ruifen take over the primary school.
    When Shi Ruifen walked sixty miles from her hometown of Daibu Town to Qingshuitang, it was a time of very serious famine. Although the people's government tried its best to provide relief, the lives of the villagers were still extremely poor due to the long-term exploitation and rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and many people could not get enough to eat. When Shi Ruifen saw such a difficult situation, she thought: How can I run a school! The idea of how to be a real people's teacher was questioning Shi Ruifen. At that time, the villagers were busy with production and disaster relief work under the leadership of the people's government. Shi Ruifen lived in a small thatched cottage in the village, cooked with a small mud stove, and ate thin gruel with the masses to survive the famine. She saved her salary to purchase school supplies, subscribe to newspapers and books, and prepare textbooks and exercise books for the students. At the same time, she went to the village's production and disaster relief meetings and to every household to publicize and mobilize students to attend school. But when the school started, there were only eighteen students. Many families' children did not come to school because they were afraid that they could not afford books and pay tuition; many people also looked down on Shi Ruifen and did not believe that a twenty-something female teacher could run the school well. At that time, Shi Ruifen often had to run from Qingshuitang to the district people's government for meetings. Some cadres also looked down on her. During the meetings, teachers from many schools were divided into groups to discuss issues, but Shi Ruifen was not assigned to a group. No one paid attention to her. When she ran up to inquire, they just grunted and answered her with their noses: "Oh, ... you? ..." It was nineteen miles from the district people's government to Qingshuitang. Shi Ruifen often returned alone late at night after the meeting. On one side of the road was a pond, and on the other side was a river. Shi Ruifen often fell into the ditch or pond, climbed up covered in mud, and walked back to her small thatched cottage. But Shi Ruifen didn't care about these things. She continued to publicize and mobilize among the masses in the village, distributing books to every family and asking every family's children to come to school. If students could not afford tuition, the school would not charge tuition for a semester. After the school was established, Shi Ruifen invited the village cadres and some parents of students to form a school affairs committee, and everyone was jointly responsible for running the school. In this way, the number of students in the school quickly increased from eighteen to thirty-one. Some children fainted during class because they had not eaten enough at home, so Shi Ruifen saved her own oatmeal paste to share with them. When some students fell ill, Shi Ruifen ran thirty miles to the city to invite doctors from the People's Hospital to treat the students. At one point, Shi Ruifen's oatmeal paste was also gone, and she only ate wild grass. To solve the students' living difficulties, Shi Ruifen led the students to reclaim wasteland for farming.
    At that time, the main disaster in Qingshuitang was insect pests. Most of the crops in the fields were eaten by rice stem borers. At that time, the people's government called on everyone to catch rice stem borers, but the peasants did not believe in this call. They said that they were "heavenly insects" and could not be caught completely. Shi Ruifen thought for a while, borrowed 30,000 yuan from her younger brother, bought some kerosene, lit two lamps in two water-filled earthenware pots, and sent them to the fields at night. As a result, more than 2,000 rice stem borer moths were caught overnight, so the peasants believed in the call of the people's government. Then Shi Ruifen mobilized the villagers to catch rice stem borers and led the students barefoot to the fields during after-school hours and on Sundays to catch rice stem borers. As a result, the villagers, including all the women, children, and old women, all took action. A hopeful wave of life surged in the disaster-stricken fields. At the end of the rice stem borer catching movement, Shi Ruifen was selected by the masses as a special-class model.
    Among the eighteen idlers in Qingshuitang, there was one named Bi Xiaobao, who was twenty-four years old this year. He was originally a laboring peasant. He grazed cattle for others in a neighboring village since he was a child. When he was seventeen years old, he returned home to farm, but later owed a lot of debts. Due to feeling hopeless about life in the old society in the past, he did not engage in production and wandered around the village all day long, gambling and even stealing things from others. His wife, Yang Lingdi, went to work in Shanghai because she was too poor to live. After Shi Ruifen learned about Bi Xiaobao's situation in the village, she not only educated him but also tried to rent three mu of land from a middle peasant in the village for him to cultivate. Gradually, Bi Xiaobao became active in production. The villagers also slowly changed their past views of him. So Shi Ruifen asked the township people's government to write a letter to his mother-in-law's family, asking his wife to come back. After a while, his wife Yang Lingdi did come back from Shanghai. She came back, but Yang Lingdi went to her parents' home as soon as she came back and was still unwilling to live with Bi Xiaobao. Shi Ruifen told Yang Lingdi in detail about Bi Xiaobao's current situation, saying that he had changed now and was no longer an idler, but Yang Lingdi still did not believe it. Later, after Shi Ruifen's constant persuasion, the masses of the whole village also cared very much about this matter, and held a full three nights of meetings in the village to deal with this matter. Finally, Bi Xiaobao guaranteed at the meeting that he would actively engage in production and strive for progress together with everyone in the future; the village peasant association also guaranteed Bi Xiaobao at the meeting. Since then, Yang Lingdi and Bi Xiaobao re-established their marital relationship and worked hard together in production and study, becoming a happy couple in the new society. During the mobilization of the masses to catch rice stem borers in the village, Bi Xiaobao was selected by the masses as a first-class model because of his active efforts. Soon, Bi Xiaobao was elected by the masses as the vice chairman of the village peasant association, leading the peasants to carry out land reform and production selflessly. Yang Lingdi also joined the village women's association and actively worked, produced, and studied with everyone. This incident educated the peasants in the whole village, and also educated other idlers, making the entire village a united, harmonious, and continuously progressing happy family.
    In order to be closely linked with the masses, Shi Ruifen was always concerned about the affairs of the masses. When people in the village had disputes, she would go to resolve them. When the peasants in the village had problems they couldn't figure out, she would try to explain them in the easiest-to-understand language. When women were about to give birth, she would go to deliver babies for them. Under Shi Ruifen's education, the children in the school also progressed day by day and became more and more sensible. So many families continued to send their children to school and entrust them to Shi Ruifen. At the end of the first semester, the number of students in the school had increased from thirty-one to forty-one. After the end of the semester, in order to give Shi Ruifen more opportunities to improve her level, the county people's government transferred her to the "Southern Jiangsu Summer Education Research Association" in Suzhou to study. The villagers were very happy when they heard the news. They said: "Our teacher from the small village has also been transferred to the province to study. This is the glory of everyone in the village." When Shi Ruifen was about to leave, all the men, women, and children in the village came to see her off. An old peasant accompanied her for seven miles. When he parted with Shi Ruifen in a village, he said to Shi Ruifen cordially: "Teacher Shi, you must study hard when you go to the province. Now you are the teacher of my family. Come back early!" When Shi Ruifen returned after studying in Suzhou for forty days, she heard that the school affairs committee of Qingshuitang Primary School had already completed the enrollment work, and the number of students had increased from forty-one to fifty-five. All the school-age children in the village had entered the school, just waiting for her to come back to teach. When Shi Ruifen walked to the edge of the village, the villagers stood at the head of the village and set off firecrackers to welcome her, and raised a banner presented to Shi Ruifen by the villagers, which was written in the villagers' own words: "Teacher Shi Ruifen: You are helping us to turn over culturally, and we are helping you to run the school well." Shi Ruifen went with everyone to see the school she had left for more than forty days, and found that the desks in the classroom had been repaired neatly, and even the fences of the vegetable garden had been woven. In February 1951, the villagers also donated twenty carpenters, forty masons, and one hundred and fifty laborers to the school to build school buildings and open up eight mu of wasteland for the school. After the school was established, Shi Ruifen mobilized the masses in the village to run a winter school. Each of the people who participated in the winter school automatically took out fifteen catties of grain; 25 members of the peasant association used a waterwheel to draw water and caught fish for four days, which was exchanged for kerosene for lighting; the township women's representatives sent dozens of eggs to the winter school; and many people made shoes and sold firewood to donate money to the winter school, solving the financial difficulties of the winter school. A total of more than 100 people in the whole village attended the winter school, and even 20 or 30 people from outside the village came to Qingshuitang Winter School to audit. Among the peasants attending the winter school, fifteen couples went to school together, and an old woman of seventy years old also came to school.
    The days of creating a difficult cause have passed day by day, but this day has not ended, it still requires the hard work and efforts of many of us; for this solemn and sacred day, we need to contribute everything we have. "Although we have not been stingy with our strength in these days," Shi Ruifen once said, "but compared with our entire cause, what we have done is still so insufficient. The achievements I have made in Qingshuitang are entirely based on the masses and explored by myself. In front of the masses, I am not even a first-grade elementary school student, at most I can only say that I am a half-year elementary school student."

    人民女教师史瑞芬
    白原
    加里宁同志有一次在苏联“教师报”编辑部所召集的城乡优等教师会议上说：“一个真正的教师，不仅是要造就成，而且还是要天生成的。”他的意思是说，一个真正的教师，不仅要精通教师的业务，而且要具有为人们所尊敬、为人们所仿效的高贵的品质。新中国的优秀女教师史瑞芬，就是这样的一位具有高贵品质的人民女教师。
    史瑞芬虽是一位年青的女教师，但由于过去在旧社会里所受的压迫，以及解放以后两年多以来的艰苦的工作，她显得这样坚毅、热情而老练。过去，在国民党反动统治下，虽然她也曾经进过几个免费的师范学校，而且在师范学校里毕了业，但是她所受到的教育，却是那个黑暗的社会给她所受的折磨。解放以前不久，因为她家欠了一个叔伯家里的钱，这一个叔伯的老婆就作媒把她嫁给一个男人，从中赚一笔钱来抵偿她家所欠的债务。因为两个人不能在一起生活，结婚以后才几个月她就离婚了，回家过着失业和穷困的痛苦的日子。
    史瑞芬的家乡——苏南溧阳县戴埠镇解放以后，在一九四九年的冬天，她到县里所举办的冬学教师学习班学习，学习的时间只有十天。在这样短的时间里，不可能让史瑞芬学到很多的东西，但是她在这十天中学到了一个重要的东西，那就是如何做一个人民的教师。了解如何做一个人民的教师，对于一个愿意把自己的一切贡献给人民的人，是不需要很长的时间的。在这十天的学习里，使史瑞芬懂得了人民教师这一个称号的意义。冬学教师学习班一结束，她就回到自己的家乡戴埠镇办冬学，在大风大雪的天气里，她辛勤地工作着，一开始就表现了她的人民教师的品质。一九五零年四月初，县人民政府派她到苏南溧阳城西北三十里一个叫做清水塘的偏僻小村庄去工作。这是一个贫穷的小村庄，全村七十六户农民，贫农、雇农就占了七十户。他们租种着地主的土地，而且土质都很不好，加以过去在国民党反动派的统治下，各种天灾人祸连年不断，有些青年农民在那些痛苦的日子里，感到生活的绝望，无心生产，并且渐渐染上了各种坏习惯，因此全村就有十八个二流子。全村一共四百六十个人，只有十个人稍稍识些字，此外全是文盲。过去村上虽然也有一所小学校，但是校长是一个整天吃酒、睡懒觉的人，校舍是一间破旧的祠堂，连一扇门板也没有，黑板和棹凳也残缺不全，学校里只有十来个学生。解放以后，人民政府把这一个校长撤换了，让史瑞芬来接办这所小学校。
    当史瑞芬从自己的家乡戴埠镇步行了六十里路来到清水塘的时候，正是灾荒非常严重的时候，虽然人民政府想尽办法来救济，但是由于过去受了国民党反动派长期的剥削和统治，村里农民的生活还是穷困不堪，许多人吃不饱饭。史瑞芬看到了这样的困难情况，就想着：怎样来办学校呵！如何做一个真正的人民教师的思想在考问着史瑞芬。那时候村里的农民在人民政府的领导下，正忙着生产度荒的工作。史瑞芬一面在村里一间矮小的茅草屋里住下，用一个小泥灶煮饭，和群众一起吃着糊汤度灾荒，把自己的薪金省下来为学校添置校具，订购报纸和书刊，为学生们准备课本和练习本；一面便在村里的生产救灾会议上、到每一个家庭里去宣传和动员学生来上学。但是等到学校开学的时候，来上学的一共只有十八个学生。许多家庭的孩子因为怕买不起书本，交不上学费没有来上学；也有许多人看不起史瑞芬，不相信这样一个二十几岁的女教师能够把学校办好。那时候，史瑞芬常常要从清水塘跑到区人民政府去开会。有些干部也看不起她。开会的时候，许多学校的教师都分组讨论问题，可是没有把史瑞芬分配到组里去。没有一个人去理会她。等她跑到人家面前去询问的时候，人家就哼一哼，用鼻子来回答她：“呵，…你？……”从区人民政府到清水塘要走十九里路，史瑞芬常常开完会，深更半夜里一个人跑回来。路上一边是池塘，一边是河水。史瑞芬常常跌到河沟或者池塘里去，带着一身的泥水爬起来，走回她的小茅草屋里去。但是，史瑞芬不管这些。她继续在村里向群众进行宣传和动员，把书本发给每一个家庭，叫每一个家庭的孩子到学校来上学。学生交不上学费，学校在一个学期里就不收学费。学校办起来以后，史瑞芬又把村干部和一部分学生家长请来，组织校务委员会，大家共同负责来办学校。这样，学校的学生很快就从十八人增加到三十一人。有几个小孩因为在家里没有吃饱饭，上课时晕倒了，史瑞芬就省下自己吃的麦糊来分给他们吃。有的学生病倒了，史瑞芬就跑三十里路到城里请人民医院的医生来给学生治病。有一个时候，史瑞芬的麦糊也吃完了，自己就光吃野草。为了解决学生的生活困难，史瑞芬就带领着学生开荒种地。
    当时清水塘的灾荒主要是虫灾，田里的庄稼大部分都被螟虫吃光了。当时人民政府号召大家来捉螟虫，但是农民们不相信这个号召，他们说那是“天虫”，捉也捉不完。史瑞芬想了想，向她的一个弟弟借了三万块钱，买了些灯油，点了两盏灯放在两个盛了水的瓦盆里，在黑夜里送到田地上去，结果一夜捕到了二千多个螟蛾，于是农民们才相信了人民政府的号召。接着史瑞芬就动员村里的群众来捉螟虫，自己也赤着脚带领着学生在课余及星期日到田地里去捉螟虫。于是村里的群众，连所有的妇女、儿童、老婆婆都一起行动起来了。在受灾的田野里泛起了一片生活有希望的浪潮。捕捉螟虫的运动结束时，史瑞芬被群众评选为特等模范。
    在清水塘的十八个二流子中，有一个名叫毕小保，今年二十四岁。他原是一个劳动农民，从小在外村给人家放牛，十七岁的时候回家种田，后来欠下很多的债，由于过去在旧社会里感觉到生活的绝望，不事生产，终日在村里游游荡荡，赌博，甚至偷人家的东西。他的老婆杨令娣，因为穷得过不下去，跑到上海做工去了。史瑞芬在村里了解了毕小保的情况以后，一面向他进行教育，一面在村里设法向一个中农租了三亩地给他耕种。慢慢地，毕小保就对生产积极起来了。村里的人们也就慢慢地改变了过去对他的看法。于是史瑞芬就请乡人民政府给他的岳母家写了一封信，叫他的老婆回来。过了一个时候，他的老婆杨令娣果然从上海回来了。回来是回来了，但是杨令娣一回来就到了娘家，依然不肯和毕小保一起过日子。史瑞芬将毕小保现在的情况详详细细地告诉了杨令娣，说他现在已经转变了，再也不是二流子了，但是杨令娣还不相信。后来经过史瑞芬对杨令娣不断地劝说，全村群众也都很关心这件事情，就在村里一连开了整整三个晚上的会来处理这件事情。最后毕小保在会上向大家保证自己今后和大家一起积极生产，努力求进步；村里的农会也在会上替毕小保作了保证。从此杨令娣就和毕小保重新建立了夫妇的感情，一齐努力生产和学习，成为一对新社会里的幸福的夫妇。在村里发动群众捕捉螟虫的时候，毕小保因为积极努力，被群众评选为头等模范。不久，毕小保被群众选为村农会的副主任，大公无私地领导农民进行土地改革和生产。杨令娣也参加了村里的妇女会，和大家在一起积极工作、生产和学习。这一件事情，教育了全村的农民，也教育了其他的二流子，使整个村庄变成了一个团结和睦、不断进步的幸福的家庭。
    为了紧密地和群众联系在一起，史瑞芬无时无刻不关心着群众的事情。村里的人们有了什么纠纷，她就去解决。村里的农民有什么想不通的问题，她就想出最易懂的语言去给他们讲解。妇女要生小孩了，她就去给妇女接生。学校里的孩子们，在史瑞芬的教育下，也一天天地进步，一天天地懂事了，于是许多家庭就不断地把孩子送到学校去，交给史瑞芬。第一个学期结束的时候，学校的学生就已经从三十一个增加到四十一个了。学期结束以后，县人民政府为了使史瑞芬能有更多的提高自己水平的机会，调她到苏州“苏南暑期教育研究会”去学习。村里的群众听到这个消息以后都很高兴，他们说：“我们小村上的先生也调到省里去学习了，这是村上大家的光荣。”史瑞芬临走的时候，全村男女老少都来欢送。有一个老农民送了七里路，在一个村子里和史瑞芬分别时，亲切地对史瑞芬说：“史先生，你到省里要好好学习。现在你是我家的先生了。你早点回来呵！”等史瑞芬在苏州学习了四十天回来，还没有走到村里，就听说清水塘小学的校务委员会早就做完了招生的工作，学生已从四十一人增加到五十五人，全村的学龄儿童统通进了学校，只等着她回来上课了。当史瑞芬走到村边的时候，全村群众站在村头上放起鞭炮来欢迎她，并且在欢迎的队伍中高举着一面全村群众送给史瑞芬的锦旗，上面用群众自己的话语写着：“史瑞芬先生：你帮我们文化翻身，我们帮你办好学校。”史瑞芬和大家一起走到她离开了四十多天的学校去一看，教室里的棹凳已经修理得整整齐齐，连菜园的篱笆也都编好了。一九五一年二月里，村里的群众还给学校献了二十个木工，四十个泥工，一百五十个小工，为学校修建校舍，并且为学校开了八亩荒地。当学校建立起来以后，史瑞芬又在村里发动群众举办了冬学。参加冬学的人们每人自动拿出十五斤谷子；农会会员二十五人用水车车水打了四天鱼，换成了点灯的煤油；乡妇女代表给冬学送了几十个鸡蛋；还有许多群众做鞋、打柴卖了钱来捐给冬学，解决了冬学经费的困难。全村上冬学的一共一百多人，连外村也有二、三十人到清水塘冬学来旁听。在上冬学的农民中，有十五对夫妇一同上学，有一个七十岁的老婆婆
    也来上学。
    艰难的事业开创的日子一天天地过去了，但是这个日子并没有完结，它还需要我们许多人的艰苦的工作和努力；为了这一个庄严的神圣的日子，需要我们贡献出自己的一切。“虽然在这些日子里，我们并没有吝啬我们的力量，”史瑞芬曾经说过，“但是和我们的整个事业比较起来，自己还是做得多么不够呵。我在清水塘所做的成绩，都是完全依靠群众，自己摸索出来的。在群众的面前，自己连一个一年级的小学生还不够，最多还只能说是一个半年级的小学生呢。”
