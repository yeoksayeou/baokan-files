Cultural Briefs

    ▲ In order to promote the rapid action of the Communist Youth League members in Shanghai's universities to participate in the citywide people's counterattack against the bourgeoisie, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held a citywide meeting of Youth League members in universities at the Municipal Gymnasium on April 1. More than 3,500 Youth League members from 28 universities including Fudan, Shanghai, and Datong attended. At the meeting, Li Chang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, gave an important report on the "Five-Anti" movement.
    ▲ The "Five-Anti" Movement Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination mobilized nearly 3,860 students from universities, colleges, and industrial and agricultural secondary schools, as well as some primary school teachers, to participate in the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou City, starting in early March. Simultaneously, from April 1st, more than 12,000 middle and primary school teachers and high school students were also mobilized for ten consecutive days to conduct "Five-Anti" propaganda work in various districts and streets. On March 23rd, Chen Xiangnan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a mobilization report to more than 11,000 teachers and students who were preparing to participate in the "Five-Anti" propaganda work. On March 26th, the teachers and students held a conference. Since April 1st, they have been using their spare time to go to various districts, using forums, heart-to-heart talks, and small reports to explain the significance, content, and policies of the "Five-Anti" movement.
    ▲ The Xi'an Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Administration established the Xi'an Laboring People's Service Station to solve the housing problem for mobile workers and impoverished laborers in the city.
    The Xi'an Laboring People's Service Station is located in a central area of the city, with neat and clean housing, bright electric lights, and clean well water, providing accommodation for more than 100 people. The charges are low, with each person paying only 1,000 yuan for tea per day, and an additional 500 yuan for renting a quilt. Mobile and impoverished laborers can move in after simple registration procedures. The station also has a recreation and reading room. Staff members can help the residents with sending and receiving letters.
    On April 6th, the second day of the station's opening, the number of residents increased from six to twenty-nine. They all said with satisfaction: "There is boiled water when we are thirsty, hot water for washing our faces, and the quilts are white and soft. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Government takes care of everything for the working people."
    ▲ In Shahe County, Hebei Province, 128 winter schools have been transformed into people's schools (out of a total of 190 administrative villages in the county), with more than 13,000 farmers participating in the study. The students' enthusiasm for learning is very high, and they have all bought new books, notebooks, dictionaries, and slates. In addition to attending school on time, they also implemented the method of "bringing books to the fields, studying during breaks, asking people whenever they meet them, and turning the fields into schools." Some villages even made small blackboards and carried them to the fields. The main reasons why most of the winter schools in the county could be transformed into people's schools are: the farmers realized that only by improving their cultural and political level can they do a good job in production and construction and increase national defense strength. They included participating in year-round study in their patriotic covenants and frequently conducted inspections. Secondly, leaders at all levels attached importance to workers' and peasants' education and strengthened the organization and leadership of farmers' learning. The county magistrate and district chiefs (such as the district chiefs of the third and fourth districts) often checked the farmers' learning situation when they went to the countryside to work; the party members and Youth League cadres in the villages also participated in the study, which encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for learning.
    ▲ The Second Medical and Preventive Service Team of the Red Cross Society of China conducted health work in Baisha, Baoting, and Ledong counties, where ethnic minorities live on Hainan Island, during January and February this year, and was warmly welcomed by the Li and Miao people. The Second Medical and Preventive Service Team was divided into three detachments, which successively entered the mountains to work in early January, and universally carried out free treatment work. In Ledong County alone, more than 100 people went to see a doctor every day. In order to further train health workers from ethnic minorities, the Medical and Preventive Service Team opened four classes of midwifery training courses in Baisha County, training 110 midwives; the ethnic minority health training course opened in Baoting County had a total of 70 students, including 50 midwives and 28 general health and epidemic prevention workers; Ledong County also opened midwifery training courses and public health training courses, with a total of 97 students. The opening of these training courses laid a preliminary foundation for cultivating health work cadres for ethnic minorities on Hainan Island.

    文化简讯
    ▲为了推动上海市高等学校中的青年团员，迅速地行动起来参加全市人民向资产阶级反击的大进军，青年团上海市工委于四月一日在市体育馆召开全市高等学校团员大会，到有复旦、沪江、大同等二十八个高等学校中的青年团员三千五百余人。会上，由青年团中央书记处书记李昌作了有关“五反”运动的重要报告。
    ▲广州市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会，从三月上旬起陆续动员了全市高等学校和工农中学的学生以及部分小学教师近三千八百六十多人参加广州市的“五反”运动。同时，由四月一日起，一连十天还有一万二千多中、小学教师和高中学生也出动到各区街头，进行“五反”宣传工作。三月二十三日，中共广州市委宣传部陈翔南副部长曾向准备参加“五反”宣传工作的一万一千多师生作了一次动员报告。三月二十六日，师生们举行了大会。他们已自四月一日起利用课余时间分别到各区，运用座谈会、谈心会、小型报告会等方式，解释“五反”运动的意义、内容和政策等。
    ▲中国人民救济总会西安市分会为解决该市流动工人和贫苦劳动人民的住舍问题，创办了西安市劳动人民服务站。
    西安市劳动人民服务站，设在市内的适中地区，房舍整齐清洁，有明亮的电灯，有洁净的井水，能供一百多人居住。收费低廉，每人每天只交茶水费一千元，租一条被子另加五百元。流动的贫苦劳动人民只要经过简单的登记手续，就能入舍。该站并设有文娱阅览室。入舍的群众写信和收发信件，都可以由工作人员代办。
    四月六日，该站开幕第二天，入舍的人数就从六名增加到二十九名，他们都满意地说：“渴了有开水，洗脸有热水，被子又白又软。有毛主席领导，人民政府什么都替劳动人民操心到了。”
    ▲河北省沙河县已有一百二十八个村的冬学转为民校（全县共一百九十个行政村），参加学习的农民达一万三千多人。学员的学习情绪非常高涨，都买了新书、笔记本、字典和石板。他们除按时到校学习外，并实行了“下地带书，休息就学，见人就问，地头变学校”的方法。有的村还做了小黑板，带着下地。全县大部分村庄的冬学能转为民校的主要原因是：农民认识到只有提高了文化政治水平，才能搞好生产建设，增加国防力量。他们把参加常年学习列入爱国公约中，并经常进行检查。其次各级领导重视了工农教育，加强了对农民学习的组织领导。县长、区长（如三、四区区长）下乡工作时经常检查农民的学习情况；各村的党员和青年团员干部也参加了学习，鼓舞了农民的学习热情。
