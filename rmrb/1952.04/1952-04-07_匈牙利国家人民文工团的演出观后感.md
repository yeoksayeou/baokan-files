    Impressions of the Performance by the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble
    Ma Ke
    We welcomed the arrival of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble as if greeting old friends we hadn't seen in a long time; we also finished watching their first performance with extraordinary excitement and satisfaction. Although this does not yet include all the programs they will perform in China, it has undoubtedly confirmed their outstanding success in politics and art.
    We often feel that many beautiful things in humanity are not limited by time, region, language, or skin color. After seeing the performance of our Hungarian friends, we more clearly realized this point. Why have these two nations, separated by thousands of miles, suddenly become so close? Why do people who don't know each other feel like old friends reunited after a long separation when they meet? Why do works with different national styles arouse mutual resonance? This is because the working people of our two countries share a common lofty ideal and the determination to fight for the realization of communism and the defense of world peace. It is like a bond that closely connects us. Every program performed by our Hungarian friends is permeated with such a spirit. When we hear their choir sing the song of defending peace and "Song of Rakosi" with their majestic and beautiful voices, or sing "The East is Red" with Chinese pronunciation, we feel that that is also the cry in our hearts. When we see one after another folk dance, and hear one after another folk orchestral music, our hearts are filled with reverence for the wisdom and creation of the working people, love for a peaceful and happy life, and longing for a better future for mankind.
    The programs performed by our Hungarian friends are permeated with a very distinct national style, which does not prevent us from understanding them. The gap in national languages is now compensated for by such vivid and rich music to express their national life, thoughts, and emotions. Many folk song choruses we heard gave us this impression. Among them, especially "Bartók Lajos," a choral suite adapted from a dance popular among Hungarian border guards four or five hundred years ago, is very impressive. The deep melody and majestic and powerful rhythm show the Hungarian people's vigor, bravery, and unrestrained enthusiasm. What is particularly noteworthy here is the orchestra that won first prize at the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival held in Berlin last year. This orchestra retains the advantages and unique skills of the Hungarian folk orchestra, gives full play to the Hungarian national style, creates, and at the same time improves the expression methods and techniques of folk orchestral music. After listening to the orchestra's performance, we feel that we are not "listening to music," but entering the realm of life that music inspires us to. All the orchestra members seem to believe that they are not "playing music," but faithfully expressing the life of the Hungarian people. We even feel that such a grand work as Liszt's "Second Hungarian Rhapsody," after being performed by this not-so-large folk orchestra, is given new meaning. It is convincing: Liszt can be understood in this way, and it is precisely this understanding that can better express the enthusiasm of the Hungarians; from their performance, it can be seen that every member does not doubt this, and they all believe that they understand Liszt the most.
    As Comrade Széllesi Gyula, the head of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble, said before the performance: "Our members originally came from the people, and our programs are also widely collected from folk music and dance from various places, and processed to make it the property of all mankind." Their approach is undoubtedly correct and successful. They have solved problems that many artists in the old era could not solve. Many artists in the old era also attempted to absorb the nutrition of folk art to enrich their works, but they always hesitated in the face of such contradictions: Is it to decorate the vivid content of folk art with a creative method based on bourgeois aesthetics, or to let the creative method obey the expression of the people's lives? Only talented artists who work for the people solve this contradiction: they are loyal to expressing the people's lives, and in the process of processing and improving, they do not strangle the vivid and lively parts of folk art, but carry it forward. Such works truly transform national and folk art into the precious artistic heritage of all mankind. We call such writers realists. Many works by great writers such as Liszt, Bartók, and Kodály have this obvious advantage. Today, we can also clearly see from the performances of our Hungarian friends that they have inherited the excellent traditions of Hungarian music and carried them forward. Each of their programs is full of the strong atmosphere of the Hungarian people's life, which is even more concentrated and fuller due to their artistic processing. Their achievements show that only in a country where the people are in power can this tradition be inherited as the direction of the development of people's literature and art. Their success makes us firmly believe in the inevitable victory of realistic people's art and the inevitable failure of formalist and cosmopolitan reactionary art.
    Our great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, has long pointed out to us the path of combining literature and art with the people. Under the shining light of his thought, we have also done some work and learned a lot from the people. But today, seeing the performances of our Hungarian friends, we feel that our work is still far from enough, and what we have learned from the infinitely rich people's life and art is only a drop in the ocean. We are willing to learn their valuable experience from our guests and friends to improve our work.
    Let us respectfully wish all comrades of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble good health and success in their work!

    匈牙利国家人民文工团的演出观后感
    马可
    我们像盼着久别重逢的老朋友似地迎接匈牙利国家人民文工团的到来；我们又以异常的兴奋和满足看完了他们的第一次演出。虽然这还没有包括他们将在中国演出的全部节目，但已毫无疑问地肯定了他们在政治上和艺术上卓越的成功。
    我们常常感到：人类有很多美好的东西是不受时间、地域、语言和肤色的限制的。当我们看到了匈牙利朋友们的演出后，更明确地体会到这一点。为什么这两个相距万里的民族、忽然变得这样亲近？为什么素不相识的人见了面觉得像久别重逢的老朋友？为什么民族风格迥异的作品会引起相互间的共鸣？这是因为我们两国的劳动人民有了一个共同的崇高理想，为实现共产主义，为保卫世界和平而斗争的决心。它像一条纽带把我们紧紧地联系起来。匈牙利朋友们演出的每一个节目，都贯串着这样一种精神。当我们听到他们的合唱团以雄美的声音唱起保卫和平之歌和“拉科西颂”，或是以中国字的发音唱起“东方红”时，我们感到那也就是我们心中的呼声。当我们看到一个又一个的民间歌舞，听到一曲又一曲的民间管弦乐时，心中充满着对于劳动人民智慧创造的崇敬，对于和平幸福生活的热爱，以及对于人类更美好的未来的向往。
    匈牙利朋友们的演出节目中，贯串着极为鲜明的民族风格，这些并不妨碍我们去理解它们。我们在民族语言上的隔阂，现在因为有如此生动、如此丰富的音乐来表现其民族的生活、思想、情感而得到了补偿。我们听到的很多民歌合唱曲给我们的印象便是这样。其中特别是“巴多斯·拉约土”，这个采自四五百年前匈牙利边防兵中流行的舞曲而编成的合唱组曲，给人的印象很深。浑厚的曲调、雄壮有力的节奏，表现出匈牙利人民的矫健、勇敢和奔放的热情。这里特别值得我们注意的是曾在去年在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节上获得一等奖的管弦乐队，这个乐队保留了匈牙利民间管弦乐队的优点和绝技，发挥了匈牙利的民族风格，创造了，同时也提高了民间管弦乐的表现方法和技术。听了这个乐队的演奏，觉得我们不是在“听音乐”，而是进入了音乐所启示给我们的生活境界。所有的乐队队员，看来他们都在相信自己不是在“奏音乐”，而是在忠实地表现匈牙利人民的生活。我们甚至觉得，像李斯特的“第二狂想曲”这样宏大的作品，经过这个数量并不庞大的民间管弦乐队的演奏，被赋予了新的意义。它令人信服：李斯特是可以这样来理解的，而且正是这样的理解，才能更发挥匈牙利人的热情；从他们的演奏中可以看出，每一个队员都不怀疑这一点，他们都相信自己是最理解李斯特的。
    诚如匈牙利国家人民文工团团长歇勒西·纠腊同志在演出前所讲的：“我们的团员原来是来自民间，我们的节目也是广泛搜集各地的民间音乐和舞蹈，予以加工，使它变成全人类的财产。”他们的这种做法无疑是正确的、成功的。他们解决了旧时代的许多艺术家们所不能解决的问题。旧时代的艺术家们也有许多人企图采取民间艺术的营养来丰富他们的作品，但是他们总是在这样的矛盾面前徘徊：是把民间艺术的生动内容去装饰从资产阶级美学观出发的创作方法呢，还是让创作方法去服从表现人民的生活？只有天才的、为人民的艺术家解决了这个矛盾：他们忠实于表现人民生活，在加工提高的过程中不是绞杀民间艺术中生动活泼的部分，而是发扬光大了它。这样的作品真正是把民族的和民间的艺术，变为全人类的宝贵的艺术遗产。这样的作家，我们称他为现实主义者。李斯特、巴尔多克、科达利等伟大作家的许多作品都具有这种显明的优点。今天我们从匈牙利朋友们的演出中也清楚看到他们是继承了匈牙利音乐的优秀传统，并且予以发扬。他们的每一节目，都充满匈牙利人民强烈的生活气息，这些更因他们在艺术上的加工，而更加集中，更加饱满了。他们的成绩说明了只有在人民当权的国家里，才能够当做人民文艺发展的方向来继承这种传统。他们的成功，使我们坚信现实主义的人民艺术的必然胜利，形式主义、世界主义的反动艺术的必然失败。
    我们中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志早向我们指出过文艺和人民相结合的道路，在他的思想光辉照耀下，我们也做了一些工作，向人民学习了不少东西。但今天看到匈牙利朋友们的演出，使我们感到我们的工作做得还很不够，我们从丰富无比的人民生活和艺术中所学到的还不过只是沧海一粟。我们愿从我们的嘉宾和挚友那里学习他们宝贵的经验以改进我们的工作。
    让我们敬祝匈牙利国家人民文工团全体同志们的身体健康和工作的胜利！
