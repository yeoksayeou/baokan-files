    Yuncheng Special District Farm Revises Plan After Winning Award
    Determined to Continue Efforts to Achieve Greater Success
    Editor: After our farm won the glorious title of "High-Yield Farm," everyone in the farm expressed new determination and a willingness to strive for greater victories on this year's agricultural production front. All the personnel of our farm, in order to forever maintain this glorious title and create greater achievements, unanimously proposed to raise the original plan of 310 jin per mu for dryland cotton to 340 jin. All the personnel of our farm also unanimously believe that not only should we continue to work hard to achieve greater achievements, but we should also introduce our high-yield experience to the local peasant masses, so as to work together with them to strive for this year's bumper harvest.

    运城专区农场获奖后修订计划
    决心再接再厉争取更大成就
    编辑同志：我场获得“丰产农场”的光荣称号后，场里的每个人都表示了新的决心，愿意在今年农业生产战线上争取更大的胜利。我们场的全体人员，为了永远保持这一光荣称号，创造更大的成绩，一致提议，把原订的旱地棉花每亩产三百一十斤的计划，提高到三百四十斤。我们场的全体人员还一致认为：我们不但要继续努力争取更大的成就，并且还要把我们的丰产经验介绍给当地农民群众，以便和他们一起为争取今年的丰产而努力。
