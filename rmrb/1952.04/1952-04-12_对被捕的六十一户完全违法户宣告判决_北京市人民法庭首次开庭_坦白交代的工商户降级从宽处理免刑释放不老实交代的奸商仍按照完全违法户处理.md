Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The Beijing People's Court held its first hearing today, announcing judgments for sixty-one households of illegal industrial and commercial businesses. Attending the hearing were over one hundred representatives from workers, shop employees, and trade associations from various districts, as well as over five hundred industrial and commercial businesses from various districts with serious violations yet to be addressed.

　　The sixty-one households of illegal industrial and commercial businesses sentenced this time were all completely illegal businesses with extremely serious violations. Moreover, in the early stages of the campaign, they resisted and denied their offenses in various ways. The Municipal People's Government arrested them according to the law. However, after being arrested and educated, they generally expressed a willingness to repent and thoroughly confess their illegal acts. Some even made meritorious contributions by reporting others, thus receiving lenient treatment with a downgrade of one or two levels and being treated as seriously illegal businesses or businesses that are half-compliant and half-illegal, avoiding sentencing and being released. For example, Li Ruitang, the manager of Yong'an Tea House, had frequently and extensively evaded taxes for three years since liberation. The circumstances were very serious, but after his arrest, he confessed thoroughly, and therefore, he was downgraded one level and treated as a seriously illegal business, avoiding criminal punishment. Another example is Lü Junfeng, the manager of Yufeng Paper Store, who was a completely illegal business owner guilty of all kinds of vices. However, after his arrest, he not only confessed thoroughly but also reported more than twenty illegal acts of other industrial and commercial businesses. During his detention, he also mobilized other major thieves to confess their problems. Therefore, he was not only not sentenced but also downgraded two levels and treated as a business that is half-compliant and half-illegal.

　　In the pronouncements, the issue of bribery by illegal industrial and commercial businesses was also handled in accordance with the spirit of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist. For example, Yu Feng Wood Store bribed government personnel with as much as 177 million yuan in a single instance, but after his arrest, he confessed thoroughly. Therefore, he was downgraded two levels and treated as a business that is half-compliant and half-illegal, and his bribery was only punished with a fine equal to the amount of the bribe. Conversely, Zhang Yuansen, the manager of Yuanliheng Iron Store, only bribed government personnel with 22.75 million yuan, but he still did not honestly confess after his arrest. Therefore, he was still treated as a completely illegal business, and in addition to paying back taxes, returning illegal gains, and being fined twice the amount of the bribe, he was also sentenced to two years in prison with a suspended sentence.

　　After Chief Judge Wang Feiran finished the pronouncements, Deputy Chief Judges Zhang Hongshun (Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions) and Le Songsheng (Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce) spoke in succession. In their speeches, in addition to explaining the principles for dealing with illegal industrial and commercial businesses, they also represented workers, shop employees, and the industrial and commercial sectors in expressing their support for this correct judgment. Then, Cheng Hongyi, a member of the Municipal Committee for Economy Practice and Examination, spoke, saying, "The purpose of the 'Five-Anti' movement is to eliminate the 'five evils' and transform illegal industrial and commercial businesses. Therefore, as long as illegal industrial and commercial businesses thoroughly confess and repent, the People's Government will treat them leniently; otherwise, they will be severely punished. Illegal industrial and commercial businesses who have not yet confessed or have not thoroughly confessed their illegal acts should learn a lesson from today's pronouncements and quickly and thoroughly confess their problems in order to obtain lenient treatment from the people and the government." Finally, he said: "On the basis of the victory of the 'Five-Anti' movement, all industrial and commercial activities that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as long as they honestly obey the laws and decrees of the People's Government, have broad prospects for development."

    对被捕的六十一户完全违法户宣告判决
    北京市人民法庭首次开庭
    坦白交代的工商户降级从宽处理免刑释放不老实交代的奸商仍按照完全违法户处理
    【新华社十一日讯】北京市人民法庭十一日首次开庭，对被捕的六十一户违法工商户宣告判决。列席旁听的有各区工人店员代表和各行业同业公会代表一百多人，另外还有各区尚未处理的严重违法的工商户五百多人。
    这次判决的六十一户违法工商户，都是完全违法户，违法行为都极严重，而且在运动初期多方抗拒抵赖，市人民政府即依法予以逮捕，但在逮捕后，经过教育，一般都愿意悔过自新，彻底交代自己的违法事实，有的并检举立功，因此得到降一级或降两级而按严重违法户或半守法半违法户从宽处理，免予判刑，宣布释放。例如永安茶庄经理李瑞棠，解放三年来经常地、大量地偷税漏税，情节十分严重，但被逮捕后彻底坦白，因此减轻一级按严重违法户处理，免予刑事处分。又如裕丰纸行经理吕均丰，是个五毒俱全的完全违法户，但在逮捕后，不但彻底坦白，并且检举了其他违法工商户的违法事实二十多件，在扣押期中还动员其他大盗窃犯坦白交代了问题，因此不但不判刑，而且减轻两级按半守法半违法户处理。
    在宣判中，对违法工商户的行贿问题，也同样贯彻坦白从宽、抗拒从严的精神。例如豫丰木器行仅向政府工作人员行贿一项即达一亿七千七百万元，但被逮捕后彻底坦白，因此减轻两级按半守法半违法户处理，其行贿部分也只处一倍的罚款。相反的如元利恒铁行经理张元森，向政府工作人员行贿数目虽然只有两千二百七十五万元，但是在逮捕后仍不老实交代，因此仍按完全违法户处理，除补税、退出违法所得，和按行贿额处以两倍罚款外，并判处两年有期徒刑，缓期执行。
    审判长王斐然宣判完毕，副审判长张鸿舜（北京市总工会副主席）、乐松生（北京市工商业联合会副主任委员）相继讲话，他们在讲话中，除了说明对违法工商户处理原则外，并分别代表工人店员和工商界对这次正确的判决表示拥护。接着由市节约检查委员会委员程宏毅讲话，他说：“五反”运动的目的是清除“五毒”、改造违法工商户，因此违法工商户只要彻底坦白悔改，人民政府就从宽处理，反之就从重处罚。直到现在还没有交代或没有彻底交代自己的违法行为的不法工商户，应该从今天的宣判中取得教训，迅速地、彻底地交代自己的问题，以取得人民和政府的宽大处理。最后他说：在“五反”运动胜利的基础上，一切从事有利于国计民生的工商业，只要老老实实服从人民政府的法令，都有宽广的发展前途。
