Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th.  U.S. Air Force planes invading Korea once again violated the agreement on the 5th, attacking a supply convoy of our delegation, injuring as many as nine members of our delegation. Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a strong protest with U.S. Colonel Kenney on the 6th. The full text of the protest is as follows: "At 11:40 a.m. on April 5th, two of your military aircraft attacked vehicles of our delegation with clear markings, en route from Pyongyang to Kaesong, at Jianshui Cave, 5 kilometers north of Xing River. One truck was completely destroyed, and nine members of our delegation were injured, three of whom were seriously injured. I am ordered by my chief representative to lodge a strong protest with your side against this incident of violating the agreement which caused significant damage, and demand that your side make a prompt and responsible handling of it."

The U.S. side's bombing and strafing of our delegation's supply vehicles, a serious violation of the agreement, has occurred many times. The U.S. side has repeatedly "expressed regret" verbally and in documents for the repeated violations of the agreement, and even said that "every possible step is being taken to prevent its recurrence." However, the facts of violating the agreement continue to emerge endlessly. This cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Korean and Chinese people.

    美机竟又违反协议袭击我代表团供应车辆
    我联络官奉命向美方提严重抗议
    【新华社开城七日电】侵朝美空军五日又一次破坏协议，攻击我方代表团供应车队，伤我代表团工作人员达九名之多。我方首席联络官张春山上校已在六日对美方肯尼上校提出严重抗议。抗议书全文如下： “四月五日上午十一时四十分，你方军用飞机两架，在兴水以北五公里处剑水洞地方，袭击自平壤驶来开城的载有明显标志的我方代表团供应车辆，全毁卡车一辆，伤我方代表团工作人员九人，其中三人伤势严重。我奉我首席代表之命，对这一造成重大伤害的违反协议的事件，向你方提出严重抗议，要求你方作迅速负责的处理。”
    美方轰炸、扫射我方代表团供应车辆，严重破坏协议的事件，已发生过多次。美方对屡次破坏协议的行为也曾在口头上和文件中一再“表示遗憾”，还说什么“正采取每一可能的步骤以防止其再度发生”。但违反协议的事实仍然层出不穷。这不能不引起朝中人民的高度警惕。
