    Improving Labor Productivity in the German Democratic Republic

    One of the goals of the German Democratic Republic's Five-Year Plan is to double production in almost all industrial sectors. Achieving this goal requires raising the technical level of industrial equipment and improving the working conditions of all working people. Therefore, the Five-Year Plan stipulates that the labor productivity of people's enterprises must increase by at least 72 percent.

    The vast number of workers in the German Democratic Republic's people's enterprises have recognized the importance of the Five-Year Plan in changing the social process. This is evidenced by their new attitude toward labor. Coal miner Adolf Hennecke first broke the production quota in October 1948, and his achievements set an inspiring example for workers across the country. Soon, the first groups of activists were formed, and they launched labor competitions. This new attitude toward labor and the new achievements it brought made it possible to expand the goals of the first German economic plan, the Two-Year Plan, in early 1949. This plan was completed in July 1950, enabling industrial production to exceed the level of 1936.

    In January 1951, worker production teams in people's enterprises, numbering 626,000 people, launched a competition for the title of "Excellent Quality Production Team." By the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, 4,539 worker production teams had been awarded this title. After joint discussions by activists, engineers, technicians, trade union personnel, and production managers, activist plans were drafted, and the working methods of Soviet engineer Kovalev were studied. In this way, the chemical industry in Saxony-Anhalt saved more than 17 million marks.

    The activist plan of the Pirna rayon factory was formulated by 378 worker teams, who put forward 750 rationalization proposals. The most successful application of the Kovalev method was in the chemical industry: activist Hibert Kovalevska increased the daily production quota of "750X20" type car tires by 61.5 percent, while maintaining the good quality of the tires.

    To improve the workers' specialized skills, activist schools were established in 1950 based on detailed discussions among the national working people. The activist school of the Riesa steel plant determined their curriculum and teaching methods according to the example of the Soviet Stakhanov schools. One of the purposes of these schools is to systematically strengthen the close cooperation between workers and technical intellectuals.

    In several large factories in the German Democratic Republic, "technical committees" were established as a result of cooperation between activists, technicians, and production managers. All technical problems of the workers were thoroughly discussed, and various working methods were consistently tested. Excellent engineers and activists conduct seminars with workers on schedule.

    In 1951, the exemplary production teams introduced the fast steel cutting method of Soviet Stakhanov worker Pavel Bykov to most steelworkers across the country, and a mass movement to study and apply this working method was launched among the workers. New machines made by people's enterprises in the German Democratic Republic using the fast steel cutting method were exhibited at the 1951 Leipzig Fair.

    Another important step in increasing labor productivity was the "Thousand Brick Movement" of the Magdeburg construction workers. The new working method pioneered by Soviet Stakhanov workers was applied by German production activists on construction sites, and their goal was to lay one thousand bricks per person per day from now on. This initiative was successful, and it was equivalent to issuing a call from Magdeburg, involving all construction sites in the German Democratic Republic in this labor competition. In just a few weeks, thousands of construction workers in Berlin, Halle, Dresden, and the huge construction site of the "East Metallurgy Combine" adopted the new working method successfully tested by their Magdeburg workmates.

    New working methods have also been adopted in the textile industry. A worker team from the Geira textile factory, including textile technician Frank, product quality inspector Sedor, and technical instructor Heinz, successfully shortened the working time. Now the yarn no longer needs to go through fourteen machines, but only seven. Some yarns only need to go through five. At the same time, the quality of the yarn has also been greatly improved. This team was awarded the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic.

    From these examples, it can be seen that the workers of the German Democratic Republic have a new understanding and are willing to improve their work efficiency. Through their joint efforts, the working people of the German Democratic Republic will increase labor productivity by 72 percent by the end of 1955 compared to 1950, thereby making people's lives happier.

### 德意志民主共和国劳动生产率的提高

    德意志民主共和国劳动生产率的提高
    德意志民主共和国五年计划的目标之一，是使差不多全部工业部门的生产量提高一倍。为达到这一目的，就需要提高工业装备的技术水平和改善全体劳动人民的劳动条件。因此，五年计划规定人民企业的劳动生产率至少要提高百分之七十二。
    德意志民主共和国人民企业的广大工人，已经认识到五年计划对改变社会进程的重要性。这一点可从他们的新劳动态度得到证明。煤矿工人阿道尔夫·海涅克在一九四八年十月首先打破生产定额，他的成就给全国工人树立了一个鼓舞人心的榜样。不久，第一批积极分子小组成立了，他们展开了劳动竞赛。这种新的劳动态度和由它而获得的新成就，使一九四九年初扩大第一个德国经济计划即两年计划的目标，成为可能。这一计划已在一九五○年七月完成，从而使工业生产超过了一九三六年的水平。
    一九五一年一月，人民企业中已经拥有六十二万六千人的工人生产队，展开了争取“优良质量生产队”称号的竞赛。到五年计划开始时，已有四千五百三十九个工人生产队荣获这一称号。经过积极分子、工程师、技师、工会人员和生产管理者的共同讨论，草拟了积极分子计划，并学习了苏联工程师郭瓦廖夫的工作法。就这样，萨克森—安哈尔特的化学工业就节省了一千七百万以上马克的资金。
    皮尔那的人造丝厂的积极分子计划是由三百七十八个工人小队制定的，他们曾提出七百五十件合理化建议。应用郭瓦廖夫工作法最成功的是化学工业：积极分子希伯特·柯瓦列夫斯卡把“七五○X二○”型的汽车轮胎的每日生产定额提高了百分之六十一点五，而轮胎的良好质量仍保持不变。
    为了提高工人的专门技能，根据全国劳动人民的详细讨论，在一九五○年成立了积极分子学校。里萨钢铁厂的积极分子学校根据苏联斯塔哈诺夫学校的榜样，确定了他们的课程和教学方法。这些学校的目的之一是有步骤地加强工人与技术知识分子之间的密切合作。
    在德意志民主共和国的几个大工厂里，由于积极分子、技术人员和生产管理者之间的合作，结果建立了“技术委员会”。工人所有的技术问题都经过彻底的讨论，各种工作法也被坚持地进行了试验。优秀的工程师和积极分子按期和工人进行研讨。
    一九五一年间，示范生产队向全国大部分钢铁工人介绍了苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者巴维尔·布科夫的快速切钢法，于是在工人中间发起了一个学习和应用这一工作法的群众运动。在一九五一年来比锡展览会上曾陈列过德意志民主共和国人民企业采用快速切钢法而制成的新机器。
    提高劳动生产率的另一重要步骤是马德堡建筑工人的“千砖运动”。由苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者所首创的新工作法被德国生产积极分子应用在建筑现场上，他们的目标是从今以后每人每天要砌一千块砖。这一创举是成功的，它等于从马德堡发出了一个号召，使德意志民主共和国所有的建筑现场都卷入这一劳动竞赛。仅仅数周之后，在柏林、哈雷、德累斯顿和“东方冶金联合厂”的巨大建筑现场上，数以千计的建筑工人都采用了由他们马德堡工友所试验成功的新工作法。
    在纺织工业中也采用了新的工作法。人民企业盖拉纺织厂的一个工人小组，包括纺织技师佛兰克、产品质量检查员塞多尔和技术指导员海尼兹，成功地缩短了工作时间。现在纱料不用再经过十四台机器，而只要经过七台。有几种纱只要经过五台。同时纱的质量也大为提高。这个小组荣获了德意志民主共和国的国家奖金。
    从这几个例子中可以看到，德意志民主共和国的工人已经有了一种新的认识，而愿意提高他们的工作效率。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，通过他们的共同努力，将于一九五五年底使劳动生产率比一九五○年提高百分之七十二，从而使人民生活更加幸福。
