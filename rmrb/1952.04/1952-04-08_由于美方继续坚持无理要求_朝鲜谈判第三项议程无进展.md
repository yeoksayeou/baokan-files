Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Due to the other side's continued insistence on the so-called demand to restrict airport equipment in Korea, which interferes with our internal affairs, and their refusal to accept our reasonable solution on the issue of neutral nation nominations, the Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 7th made no progress.
