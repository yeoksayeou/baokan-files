I am a Witness to the U.S. Aircraft Spreading Germ-Carrying Insects
Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Since the U.S. imperialists continuously and massively spread bacteria-laden insects in Korea and Northeast China, people all over the world who love peace and uphold justice have been aroused to public outrage and have issued stern condemnations. We, the Chinese people, with unparalleled confidence, strong will, and enthusiastic action, are determined to extinguish the poisonous flames of U.S. imperialism. In this struggle against bacteriological warfare, victory will surely belong to us. The experience of more than a month has proven that the poisonous insects scattered by U.S. imperialism have been annihilated by the powerful force of our people.

Due to the nature of my work, I have been constantly asked about the types of poisonous insects scattered by U.S. imperialism, how we can prove they were scattered by U.S. imperialism, how harmful they are, and what are the fastest and most effective ways to eliminate them. To answer these questions, I will provide some explanations based on my personal participation in insect identification work, as a witness to the U.S. aircraft spreading germ-carrying insects.

I. Types of Poisonous Insects

The types of poisonous insects scattered by U.S. imperialism are numerous and cover a wide range. We know that in addition to insects and spiders, there are other animals, as well as things like chicken feathers, leaves, and cotton. Here, I will only explain eight types of poisonous insects separately: black flies, houseflies, large flies, dung flies, Korean leopard-legged mosquitoes, locusts, springtails, and spiders.

Black flies are insects of the Anthomyiidae family in the order Diptera. Their body shape is slightly similar to houseflies, but they are entirely black, their wings are shiny, and their bodies are densely covered with bristles, which is a good condition for carrying bacteria. In Korea and Northeast China, in the cold weather below minus ten degrees Celsius and in the snowy environment, the most frequently found insects after U.S. planes flew over were these. Imagine, in such circumstances, who would believe that they were not scattered by U.S. imperialism? Moreover, we have isolated dangerous pathogens such as Meningococcus and Bacillus anthracis from the black fly specimens captured in Korea.

Houseflies are the most common insects we see, but they do not appear in sub-zero climates. This time, in a village in Siping, Northeast China, piles of houseflies suddenly appeared on the snow after U.S. imperialist planes flew over. This undeniably proves these insects were spread by U.S. planes. We know that houseflies are notorious medical pests that can transmit typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, anthrax, conjunctivitis, yaws, tuberculosis, and so on.

Large flies are larger than houseflies and are also a common medical pest. They have been found in large numbers in various parts of Northeast China. The situation in which they were found is similar to that of houseflies, and we have isolated typhoid bacilli from their bodies.

Dung flies are insects of the Muscidae family in the order Diptera, and their shape is generally slightly smaller than houseflies. This time, they often suddenly appeared in groups on the snow in areas where enemy aircraft flew over in Northeast China, which is obviously scattered by U.S. aircraft. We have isolated paratyphoid bacilli from dung flies.

Korean leopard-legged mosquito is a species of the Aedes genus. We know that Aedes mosquitoes can transmit serious epidemic diseases such as epidemic encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue fever. This shows the sinister intentions of U.S. imperialism in spreading this poisonous insect.

Locusts are the most serious pests of crops in China and overwinter as eggs. In Northeast China, adults die successively after laying eggs until late autumn, and the eggs do not hatch until May of the following year. Therefore, before April, it is impossible for locust nymphs or adults to appear. This time, a batch of live adult locusts was found near the dormitory of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department in Shenyang. Unless these were scattered by U.S. aircraft, it is simply an unimaginable fact.

Black springtails are a type of small, wingless insects that can jump. They prefer humidity, and some species can move on the snow surface. Generally speaking, black springtails are not important economic insects, but they are cold-resistant and can move on the snow surface. U.S. imperialism has used this condition to cultivate them into poisonous insects in bacterial factories and scatter them in large quantities on Chinese and Korean territories. We have proven that the insect body carries rickettsiae, and when the insect is ground and injected subcutaneously into guinea pigs, the guinea pigs die after eight days.

Spiders are also one of the poisonous insects dropped by U.S. imperialism, in large quantities and of more than one kind. They are often found in places where U.S. aircraft have passed. We have isolated dangerous infectious pathogens from these poisonous spiders.

II. Conclusive Evidence

Seeing these many types of poisonous insects, and seeing the many abnormalities in their appearance, we know that the crime of U.S. imperialism in spreading poisonous insects has conclusive and irrefutable evidence: (1) The season in which these insects appear is abnormal. In late February and early March, the climate in Korea and Northeast China is often still below zero degrees Celsius. The appearance of so many insects is not only unprecedented for the local people but also unbelievable for anyone with common sense. For example, houseflies should not appear until mid-April, but in mid-March, male and female adults were found in large numbers in Siping City, Liaoxi Province. Korean leopard-legged mosquitoes should not appear until late May at the earliest, but male and female adults of this mosquito were found in Tieling, Liaoxi Province, on March 4. Spiders should not be active until mid-April, but large numbers of spiders were found in the Zhenjiangshan area of Andong City on March 3. Locusts should appear in May or June, but they were found near the dormitory of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department in Shenyang City on March 15. These examples illustrate that the appearance time of many insects is abnormal, much earlier than the naturally occurring insects in the local area. (2) The places where these insects appear are abnormal. For example, black springtails were found on the steel-reinforced concrete stands of the racetrack in Fushun City, six meters high; locusts were found on a cold March day on the open-air concrete platform on the second floor of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department in Shenyang City; large numbers of flies and mosquitoes were found in large numbers on beaches, hillsides, or completely exposed farmland in Andong City and Kuandian County, and even on the snow. Under normal circumstances, it is impossible for these insects to appear in these places. (3) The aggregation state of these insects is abnormal. According to the report of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare," the appearance of these insects is phased, dense, and mixed with many different kinds of insects, which is fundamentally different from the widespread and dispersed distribution of naturally growing insects in the local area.

(4) The distribution state of these insects is abnormal. Their discovery locations are all in the areas where U.S. aircraft intruded and were active and in nearby places. In other areas at the same latitude, same temperature, and same geographical conditions, the above-mentioned insects have not been found to this day. (5) The bacterial state of these insects is abnormal. In places where there is no epidemic, the rate of insects carrying pathogens cannot be very high. However, not only is the bacterial carriage rate of these insects very high, and the types of pathogens are numerous, but also the types of bacteria-carrying insects are also very peculiar. For example, black flies, black springtails, winter crane flies, etc., which are not usually considered medical insects, have now been proven to carry dangerous pathogens. This series of abnormal phenomena has only one possible explanation: that these insects were all scattered by U.S. aircraft. Now, U.S. imperialism is spreading bacterial poisonous insects on the one hand, while spreading rumors on the other, attempting to deny and cover up their crimes. In addition to fully exposing the vile and shameless face of the aggressor, they cannot deny these ironclad facts.

III. Insidious and Cunning

We have confirmed from these poisonous insects that U.S. imperialism wants to use various dangerous pathogens to slaughter our people and harm our livestock. The pathogens we have isolated, such as encephalitis and anthrax, can not only cause fatal epidemics in humans, but also have a wide range of effects on general livestock. Even birds in the air can hardly avoid poisoning. The fact that we have no epidemics at present is due to the strictness of our prevention and control measures. They also want to use various poisonous insects to directly or indirectly harm our crops. For example, locusts and black flies are serious crop pests.

We have also proven that the insects scattered by U.S. imperialism are not only numerous in variety, but also have various properties. Some are medical pests, some are crop pests, and some are species that are not generally considered pests under normal conditions. Among these species, many are widely distributed. Obviously, U.S. imperialism wants to use this to achieve its goal of denying while spreading insects. What is particularly hateful is that it uses those insects, which are usually not considered medical pests, to spread dangerous pathogens. Such as black flies, black springtails, winter crane flies, etc., their names are not in the medical entomology books, but the U.S. imperialists have used certain characteristics of them that are conducive to spreading pathogens to cultivate them into poisonous insects and scatter them in large quantities on the ground in China and Korea. From here, we can more clearly see the most vile, shameless, and cunning face of the U.S. imperialists.

IV. Resolutely Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of U.S. Imperialism

No matter how numerous the types of poisonous insects scattered by U.S. imperialism, how insidious its intentions, or how cunning its methods, we have conclusive and irrefutable evidence to expose the inhumane, vile, and shameless crimes of U.S. imperialism. We, the Chinese people, have even more firm confidence and powerful strength to thoroughly extinguish the poisonous flames of U.S. imperialism.

There are two of the most famous pests in Chinese history, locusts and rice borers, which have harmed crops for thousands of years and caused the most serious damage to the people. However, under the leadership of the People's Government and with the strong prevention and control measures organized by the masses, last year's locusts and rice borers did not cause disasters and were smoothly eliminated. As for the poisonous insects scattered by U.S. imperialism today, as long as we take planned and organized epidemic prevention measures, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and carry out insect extermination and disinfection campaigns, their annihilation will inevitably be rapid and thorough. Our national scientific workers should even more unanimously stand at the forefront of this anti-bacterial warfare, contribute our technology, and exert our strength to assist the masses and shatter the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

    我是美国飞机撒布带菌昆虫的证人
    中国科学院昆虫研究室主任  陈世骧
    自从美帝国主义在朝鲜及我国东北连续地大量地撒布带有细菌的昆虫以来，全世界各地的人士，凡是爱好和平主持正义的，都已激起了公愤，发出了严正的谴责。我中国人民，更以无比的信心，坚强的意志，热烈地行动起来，决心扑灭美帝国主义的毒焰。在这个反细菌战的斗争中，胜利一定是属于我们的。一个多月来的经验已经证明，美帝国主义撒下的毒虫，已被我人民的强大力量所扑灭了。
    由于个人工作岗位的关系，近来各方面曾不断地来询问：关于美帝国主义撒下的毒虫究竟是那些种类？我们怎样来证明它们是美帝国主义所撒布的？它们的为害性如何？我们应采取怎样的最迅速最有效的办法来扑灭？为了解答这些问题，特根据个人亲自参加昆虫检定工作的所得，作为美机撒布带菌昆虫的一个见证人，来提供一些说明。
    一、毒虫的种类
    美帝国主义撒下的毒虫种类是很多的，而且包含的范围很广。我们知道，除了昆虫蜘蛛之外，还有其他的动物，以及鸡毛、树叶、棉花之类。这里只就黑蝇、家蝇、大家蝇、粪蝇、高丽豹脚蚊、蝗虫、跳虫、蜘蛛等八种毒虫分别作些说明。
    黑蝇是双翅目花蝇科的昆虫，它的体形大小略似家蝇，全身黑色，双翅发光，体上密布丛毛，是带菌的很好条件。在朝鲜和东北各地，在零下十度的寒冷天气下，冰天雪地的环境中，美国飞机飞过后最多发见的就是它。试想在这样的情况下，谁会相信它不是美帝国主义撒布的？而且我们已在朝鲜捉到的黑蝇标本上分离出了脑膜炎双球菌，炭疽杆菌等危险病菌。
    家蝇是我们最常见的昆虫，但是在零下的气候中它是不会出现的。这次东北四平乡村内的雪地上，在美帝国主义飞机飞过后突然出现了成堆的家蝇，这无可否认地是美机撒下来的毒虫。我们知道家蝇是著名的医学害虫，它能传染伤寒、痢疾、霍乱、炭疽、结合膜炎、雅司病、结核病等等。
    大家蝇形体比家蝇为大，也是一种常见的医学害虫，这次在东北各地发见得很多，发见的情况和家蝇相似，我们已在它身上分离得到伤寒杆菌。
    粪蝇是双翅目日蝇科的昆虫，形体一般较家蝇略小。这次在东北敌机飞越的区域内雪地上常会突然成群出现，很明显地是美国飞机撒下来的。我们已从粪蝇分离出副伤寒杆菌。
    高丽豹脚蚊是黑斑蚊属的一种。我们知道黑斑蚊能传染流行性脑炎、黄热病、登革热等严重疫病，美帝国主义撒布这个毒虫的居心险恶，于此可见。
    蝗虫是中国最严重的农作物害虫，它是以卵过冬的。在东北，成虫于产卵后到秋末便相继死亡，所产的卵要到翌年五月才孵化。因此在四月以前，不可能有蝗虫的幼蝻或成虫出现。这次在沈阳东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近，发见了一批活的蝗虫成虫，这除非是美国飞机撒布下来，简直是一桩不可想像的事实。
    黑跳虫是一类无翅能跳的小型昆虫，它们性喜潮湿，有些种类能在雪面活动。一般说来，黑跳虫不是重要的经济昆虫，但是它们能耐寒，能在雪面上活动。美帝国主义利用了这个条件，便在细菌工厂内把它培养成为毒虫，大量地撒布在中朝国土上。我们已经证明，该虫体上带有立克次氏体，把该虫磨碎，注射在豚鼠皮下，八天后豚鼠便死亡。
    蜘蛛也是美帝国主义投下的毒虫之一，数量很多而且不止一种。在美国飞机经过的地方常常发见。我们已在这些毒蜘蛛身上，分离出危险的传染病菌。
    二、确凿的罪证
    我们看到这许多毒虫的种类，看到它们出现情况的许多反常性，可知美帝国主义撒布毒虫的罪行，已有着确凿的不可辩驳的证据：（一）这些昆虫出现的季节是反常的。二月底三月初的时节，朝鲜和我国东北的气候经常还在零度以下，有这么多的昆虫出现，不仅是当地人民所从来未见，也是稍有常识的人所不能相信，例如家蝇应在四月中旬才能出现，但是在三月中旬却在辽西省的四平市大量发现了雌雄成虫。高丽豹脚蚊最早应在五月下旬才能出现，但是在辽西省的铁岭，在三月四日就发现了这种蚊子的雌雄成虫。蜘蛛应在四月中才能活动，但是在三月三日安东市镇江山一带就发现了大量蜘蛛。蝗虫应在五、六月出现，但是三月十五日却在沈阳市东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近发现了。这些例子说明了许多昆虫的出现时间是反常的，较本地自然发生的昆虫要早得多。（二）这些昆虫出现的场所是反常的。例如黑跳虫曾发现在抚顺市跑马场六公尺高的钢骨水泥的看台上；蝗虫在三月中旬寒冷的天气里在沈阳市东北人民政府贸易部的二层露天的水泥平台上发现；大量的蝇、蚊，在安东市及宽甸县的沙滩、高山坡上或完全暴露的农田里，甚至在雪地上大量发现。按照正常情况，这些昆虫在这些场所出现是不可能的。（三）这些昆虫的聚集状态是反常的。根据“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团的报告，这些昆虫的出现是有段落的，密集的，而且是许多不同种类的昆虫混杂在一起，和本地自然生长的昆虫的普遍的分散的分布情形根本不同。
    （四）这些昆虫的分布状态是反常的，它们的发现地点，都是美国飞机侵入和活动的地区及其附近地方。而在同一纬度，同一气温和同样地理条件下的其它大部分地方，却到现在还没有发现上述虫子。（五）这些昆虫的带菌状态是反常的。在没有疫病流行的地方，昆虫携带病菌的比率不可能是很高的。但是这些昆虫不仅是带菌率很高，病原体种类很多，而且带菌的昆虫种类也是十分的奇特。例如黑蝇、黑跳虫、冬大蚊之类，平常不认为医学昆虫的，现在都已证明了带有危险的病原体。这一连串的反常现象，只有一个可能的解释，就是这批昆虫都是由美国飞机所撒布下来的。现在美帝国主义一方面在撒布细菌毒虫，一方面却在散布谣言，企图抵赖掩饰他们的罪行，这除了十足暴露出侵略者的卑鄙无耻面目之外，对着这些铁的事实，他们是抵赖不了的。
    三、阴险和狡猾
    我们从这些毒虫已经证实：美帝国主义想用各种危险的病菌，来屠杀我人民，伤害我牲畜。我们已经分离出的病菌如脑炎、炭疽，不仅对人类可以引起致命的疫病，便是一般家畜，受害的范围也是很广。甚至空中飞鸟，也难避免毒害。目下我们疫病没有流行，是由于我们防治严密的结果。他们还想用各种毒虫，直接地或间接地来危害我们的农作物，例如，蝗虫、黑蝇，都是严重的农作物害虫。
    我们并且已经证明，美帝国主义撒布的昆虫，不仅种类很多，并且各种性质的都有。有的是医学害虫，有的是农作物害虫，也有的在平常状态下，一般并不认为是害虫的种类。在这些种类中，很多是分布很广的。很明显的，美帝国主义想借此来达到它一面撒虫一面抵赖的目的。尤其可恶的是它利用了那些昆虫，通常并不认为是医学害虫的，来传播危险的病菌。如黑蝇、黑跳虫、冬大蚊之类，它们的名字在医学昆虫学上没有册籍，但是美帝国主义者却利用它们的某些特性有利于传播病菌，便培养成了毒虫，大量地撒布在中朝的地面上。从这里我们可以更清楚地看出美帝国主义者的最卑鄙最无耻最狡猾的面貌。
    四、坚决扑灭美帝国主义的毒焰
    不管美帝国主义撒下的毒虫种类如何众多，居心如何阴险，手段如何狡猾，我们已有确凿的、无可辩驳的证据，把美帝国主义灭绝人性的、卑鄙无耻的罪行揭露出来了。我中国人民，更有坚定的信心，强大的力量，来彻底扑灭美帝国主义的毒焰。
    中国历史上有两种最著名的害虫，蝗虫和螟虫，数千年来为害庄稼，使人民遭受到最严重的损害，但是在人民政府的领导下，在群众有组织的大力防治下，去年的蝗螟便没有酿成灾害，而是很顺利地扑灭了，对于今天美帝国主义所撒布的毒虫，只要我们采取有计划有组织的防疫措施，信任群众，依靠群众，开展灭虫消毒运动，其被扑灭必然会是迅速而彻底的。我全国的科学工作同志们，更应该一致地站在这个反细菌战斗的最前线，贡献出我们的技术，发挥出我们的力量，来协助群众，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
