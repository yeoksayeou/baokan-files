More Fully and Profoundly Elucidate Economic Issues

The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on March 29th on how newspapers should explain economic issues. An abstract follows:

In the struggle to continuously improve all economic sectors of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik newspapers play a significant role.

As early as 1921, Lenin pointed out that newspapers should be a fighting organ, which should not only regularly report real economic news, but also analyze this news and conduct scientific research on it to draw correct conclusions. At the same time, the newspaper should be an organ that drives all workers on the economic front to strive to establish accurate reporting systems, support successful work, and submit careless, backward, and incompetent workers in certain enterprises, institutions, or economic sectors to public opinion for judgment.

When newspapers analyze the work of certain industrial sectors or individual enterprises, they must take into account the qualitative changes that have taken place in the national economy in recent years. At present, in the socialist competition in which each workshop and enterprise resolutely completes the state plan according to the established product names and categories, the main task is to continuously improve quality indicators.

Our newspapers should daily elaborate on the laboring people's struggle to fulfill and overfulfill the state plan, to improve product quality and reduce production costs, to conserve raw materials and equipment, to correctly use the inherent potential of industry and agriculture, to adopt new machines and technologies, and to further improve labor productivity and production levels.

The creativity and enthusiasm of the laboring people are constantly growing. Socialist competition brings us new and constantly changing patriotic initiatives every day. This makes it the responsibility of every newspaper to regularly and well familiarize itself with all new and progressive things originating from various enterprises and collective farms, and to carefully study, summarize, and widely promote advanced experiences. At the same time, the newspaper's editorial department should more thoughtfully evaluate various initiatives, and resolutely combat various far-fetched methods and bureaucratic distortions in the competition.

In addition, it is very important for newspapers to explain the practical results and economic effectiveness obtained by adopting scientific achievements and the experience of production innovators.

The role of newspapers and periodicals in organizing production competitions is enormous. Newspapers and periodicals can ensure the publication of competitions, the comparison of results, and enable advanced experience to be practically reviewed. For both advanced and backward enterprises, newspapers should appropriately and comprehensively analyze their work, teach them with advanced experience, indicate ways to overcome backwardness, and assist them in achieving newer achievements in their work.

Newspapers should use prominent space to elaborate on various issues in the development of socialist agriculture. The responsibility of newspapers is to help Party organizations mobilize all forces to complete the main tasks in agriculture—to greatly increase the yield of various crops, and to expand the number of public livestock while greatly increasing livestock production.

To profoundly understand the urgent problems in the socialist economy, newspaper workers must more fully and deeply study the life and work in enterprises and collective farms, master economic knowledge, and strengthen ties with the masses. The more widely the newspaper editorial department attracts scholars, production innovators, economic workers, economic experts, designers, and Party activists in enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms to participate in the work of the newspaper, the more successfully it can shoulder the task of explaining economic issues.

Improving the Level of Book Publishing Work

The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an article by Vorontsov on April 12th on improving the level of book publishing work. An abstract follows:

The reduction in the price of books most clearly illustrates that our book publishing work has achieved further improvement. Until recently, many publishing houses only strove to increase the number of publications year after year, rather than paying more attention to expanding the distribution of valuable and urgently needed books. Such a working method often reduces the quality of our books.

We must resolutely improve book publishing plans and ensure that works necessary for the broad masses of readers can be published in larger quantities. The General Administration of Printing, Publishing, and Book Sales directly under the Soviet Council of Ministers, and the various ministries and competent authorities attached to publishing institutions, must completely eliminate the spontaneous phenomenon in determining the number of books published and distributed. Correctly determining the number of books published and distributed is one of the important tasks of the publishing industry.

Improving the ideological and cultural level of book publishing work is closely related to its profitability. The more urgently needed books a publishing house can publish, the higher the demand for the books it publishes, and the more profitable it will be.

Publishing workers should treat their business with a truly creative attitude. Their responsibility is to be able to unite excellent creative forces, those intellectuals, Party and Soviet workers, and advanced workers in industry and agriculture who are good at vividly, skillfully, and profoundly creating books about the various lives and work of the Soviet people, around the publishing house.

However, in some publishing houses, it is still possible to encounter some cases of treating writers with incorrect and bureaucratic attitudes. Some publishing houses often do not lead writers cautiously and thoughtfully, helping them to improve their creativity, but instead let these things fall into a state of laissez-faire. Sometimes there are also things like some publishing houses relying on people with insufficient abilities, or even relying on notoriously shoddy writers, to prepare for the publication of books.

Our readers' high demands for books make it the responsibility of the leaders of various publishing houses to insist on continuously improving the level of the publishing industry.

The Bolshevik Party entrusts huge, nationally significant work to various publishing houses. Every publishing house should publish works with high ideological content. Every publishing house must work purposefully and have a well-considered and well-thought-out plan. The phenomena of harmony and lack of principle in some publishing houses must be resolutely eradicated, and we must insist on improving work styles, doing a good job in selecting and training editors, book reviewers, and consultants, and actively strengthening the work of editorial and publishing committees.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    更充分更深刻地阐明经济问题
    苏联真理报三月二十九日发表了论报纸应如何说明经济问题的社论，摘要如下：
    在争取苏联的一切经济部门获得不断提高的斗争中，布尔什维克的报刊起着很大的作用。
    早在一九二一年时列宁就曾指出，报纸应当是一个战斗机关，它不仅要经常报道真实的经济消息，而且也要分析这些消息，并对它进行科学的研究，以便从其中得出正确的结论；同时报纸应当是这样的一个机关，它带动经济战线上的全体工作者，争取建立精确的表报制，赞助有成绩的工作，并把某些企业、机关或经济部门的粗枝大叶的、落后的和无能的工作者交给社会舆论去裁判。
    当报纸分析某些工业部门或个别企业单位的工作时，必须估计到近年来在国民经济中所发生的质量的变化。目前，在每个车间、企业依照业经确定的产品名称和类别来坚决完成国家计划的社会主义竞赛中，主要任务便是不断地提高质量指数。
    在我们的报面上，应当对劳动人民争取完成和超额完成国家计划，争取提高产品质量和降低产品成本、节约原料和器材、正确使用工业农业的内在潜力，争取采用新的机器和技术、进一步提高劳动生产率和生产水平的斗争，逐日地加以阐述。
    劳动人民的创造性和积极性不断地增长着。社会主义竞赛每天都为我们带来了日新月异的爱国主义的创举。这就使每个报纸都有责任来经常地、很好地熟悉产生自各企业和集体农场的一切新的和进步的事物，并仔细地研究、总结和广泛地推广先进经验。与此同时，报纸的编辑部应当更为深思熟虑地来评价各种创举，坚决打击竞赛中的各种牵强方式和官僚主义的歪曲。
    此外，用报纸来说明因采用科学成就和生产革新者的经验而获得的实际成果和经济效力，也是非常重要的。
    在组织生产竞赛中，报刊的作用是巨大的。报刊能保证公布竞赛、比较成绩、并能使先进经验得到实际复习。对于一些先进的企业也正如对于一些落后的企业一样，报纸应适当地全面地分析它们的工作，以先进经验教导它们，指示克服落后现象的途径，协助它们在工作中取得更新的成绩。
    报纸应当用显著的地位来阐述社会主义农业发展中的各种问题。报纸的责任就是要帮助党组织、动员一切力量来完成农业中的主要任务——大量提高各种农作物的收获量，在大大提高畜类生产量的同时，扩大公共牲畜的头数。
    要深谙事理地说明社会主义经济中的迫切问题，报刊工作者就必须更充分更深刻地研究企业和集体农场中的生活和工作，掌握经济知识，加强与群众的联系。报纸编辑部越能广泛地把学者、生产革新者、经济工作人员、经济专家、设计家以及企业、集体农场、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的党的积极分子吸引参加报纸的工作，那么它就越能成功地担负起说明经济问题的任务。
    提高书籍出版工作的水平
    苏联真理报四月十二日发表沃龙错夫论提高书籍出版工作水平的论文，摘要如下：
    书的减价最确实地说明了我们的书籍出版工作已获得进一步的改善。到最近为止，很多出版社只是努力想年复一年地增大出版物的数量，而不是更多地去注意扩大有价值和迫切需要的书的发行数量。这样的工作方法往往会降低我们书籍的质量。
    我们必须坚决改进书籍的出版计划，保证那些为广大读者所必需的作品能扩大出版量。苏联部长会议直属印刷、出版、售书事业总管理局和附有出版机构的各部和各主管机关，必须完全消除在确定书籍出版发行数量方面的自流现象。正确地确定书的出版发行数量是出版事业的重要任务之一。
    提高书籍出版工作的思想和文化水平，是和它的赢利多寡密切相关联的。一个出版社越能多出版迫切需要的书籍，那么对它所出版的书的需求也就会越高，而它的获利也就越多。
    出版工作者应当以真正的创造性的态度来对待自己的业务。他们的责任就是要能把优秀的创作力量，能把那些知识分子、党和苏维埃的工作人员、工农业劳动者中的先进的、善于鲜明地、巧妙地、深谙事理地创作有关苏联人民的各种各样生活和工作的书籍的人，团结在出版社的周围。
    但是在一些出版社中，还是可能遇到一些以不正确的、官僚主义的态度来对待作家的情况。有些出版社往往不是谨慎地、深思熟虑地领导作家，帮助他们提高创造力，而是让这些事情陷于自流状态。有时也有这样的事情，即一些出版社在准备出版书籍方面依赖能力不足的人，甚或是依赖人所共知的粗制滥造的作家。
    我们的读者对书籍的高度要求，使各个出版社的领导人有责任来坚持不断地提高出版事业的水平。
    布尔什维克党把巨大的具有全国性意义的工作，委托给各出版社。每一个出版社都应当出版有高度思想性的作品。每一个出版社都必须有目的地进行工作，并具有很好的考虑周密的计划。必须坚决根除一些出版社中的一团和气和无原则性的现象，坚持改善工作作风，做好选拔和培养编辑、书报评论家和顾问的工作，并积极加强编辑出版委员会的工作。
