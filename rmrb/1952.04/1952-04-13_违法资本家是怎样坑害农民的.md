How Illegal Capitalists Cheat Farmers
Sima Jin

Robber-like Fraud and Plunder

In the autumn of 1950, Ma Jingfu, a tobacco farmer in Tayu District, Fushun, Northeast China, harvested his tobacco leaves. He thought, "With such good tobacco leaves, I won't have trouble selling them for a good price." One day, a buyer came on a bicycle. Ma Jingfu wanted 110,000 yuan (Northeast currency) per jin, but the buyer only offered 82,000 yuan. He said, "This year's tobacco harvest is good, but the market isn't. The state has planted tens of thousands of mu of tobacco and won't buy it!" Upon hearing the price of 82,000 yuan per jin, Ma Jingfu was furious and repeatedly said, "I won't sell! I won't sell!" and sent the buyer away. Then, nine more buyers came, all offering the same price and saying the same thing. Ma Jingfu firmly refused to sell. When the eleventh buyer came, he offered 85,000 yuan. Ma Jingfu hesitated for a while and finally sold his tobacco to the eleventh buyer at the price of 85,000 yuan per jin. Ma Jingfu only discovered the truth when he delivered the goods: all eleven buyers were from the same company, sent by Li Tingshang, a奸商 (crafty merchant) in Fushun, to besiege farmers in shifts and suppress tobacco prices.

This is a true story, but not the only one. In the past three years, while the bourgeoisie has been launching a frenzied attack on the working class, it has also carried out robber-like plunder against farmers. In Chuxian and Feixi areas of northern Anhui, merchants often blocked the road and forcibly bought grain, cotton, hemp, pigs, chickens, etc. that farmers were transporting to the city for sale with very little money. Liu Yingmin, the manager of the "Shanghai Tobacco Company" in Weifang City, Shandong Province, instructed his assistants to kick the scale pan with their feet and push the weight with their hands when buying yellow tobacco from farmers, closing the scale door before the balance was stable, reducing the weight, and robbing farmers of their yellow tobacco. The four vegetable seed firms in Beijing, Heji, Wenjucheng, Jushengyong, and Huakang, known as the "Four Great Families" in the vegetable seed industry and monopolizing the national vegetable seed trade, sold more than 4,700 jin of completely ineffective vegetable seeds to farmers in the past three years. In many places,奸商 (crafty merchants) specially prepared inferior goods for farmers, using flowery words to deceive them and sell them at high prices. In Northeast China and Shandong, timber merchants were found to be selling cooking utensils made from old coffins. When farmers bought them back and steamed rice, the whole pot smelled of corpses. Farmers in Dayi County, western Sichuan, bought razors in Chengdu, which the merchants claimed were "Shanghai goods" and "insurance goods," but they couldn't shave hair at all. Farmers in Shangzhou Township, Leshan County, southern Sichuan, sold bamboo ginseng to merchants for 500 yuan per liang; the merchants transported it to Yibin (235 li from Shangzhou Township) and sold it for 8,000 yuan per liang. The bosses of illegal stores used despicable means such as adding water to wine, mixing flour into white sugar, weaving new sweaters from bad yarn, and using twelve taels to calculate one jin, to rob farmers of their labor fruits in large quantities.

Sabotaging Farmers' Cooperatives

Illegal capitalists are very hostile to cooperatives. Semi-socialist cooperatives, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, organize farmers, allowing them to get rid of merchant middleman exploitation and move towards the road of socialism. The bourgeoisie regards cooperatives as a thorn in their side. In many places, merchants have organized "joint venture societies" specifically to counter farmers' cooperatives. They deceive farmers by saying, "Cooperatives serve members, and 'joint venture societies' serve the masses." They call "joint venture societies" "new cooperatives." A person in charge of the Industry and Commerce Federation in a certain area openly called on private merchants to "organize to fight against cooperatives and fight with cooperatives"; and recklessly said: "We must defeat the cooperatives!" When merchants saw members buying meat at the cooperative, they spread rumors, saying, "Members' meat purchases are recorded in the book, and taxes will be levied in the future. It will be considered exploitation, saying you are eating and drinking too much." In order to squeeze out cooperatives,奸商 (crafty merchants) also used petty favors to win over cooperative cadres and district and township leaders, or sent "spies" to infiltrate cooperatives, steal national economic intelligence, and collude internally and externally to undermine cooperatives. In the eighteen supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanjing,奸商 (crafty merchants) sent in more than twenty "spies." A certain奸商 (crafty merchant) in Tianjin infiltrated a cooperative, stole a large amount of public funds from the cooperative, opened a factory himself, made many inferior goods, and then sold them to farmers at high prices through the cooperative system.

Sabotaging Water Conservancy Construction

Water conservancy construction is an important part of restoring and developing agricultural production. Since the founding of the People's Government, it has vigorously carried out water conservancy construction and helped farmers to control rivers and dig canals to improve agricultural production. However, illegal capitalists wantonly sabotaged water conservancy projects to seek exorbitant profits. In the Huai River control project, from surveying, design, procurement, dredging to earthwork and culvert construction, the bourgeoisie had opportunities to make money everywhere.奸商 (crafty merchants) in Shanghai and Hankou defrauded state property and caused engineering losses of 20 billion yuan. The current meters sold by奸商 (crafty merchants) were ineffective, making the hydrological records of the Huai River and its tributaries inaccurate, making the design of the Huai River control project lose reliable basis, and seriously affecting the progress of the project. In the Luohe Canal in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, which can irrigate 420,000 mu of land, many projects were found to be leaking and cracked after completion. When the fields needed water, they could not be irrigated, and when water was not needed, the water broke through the embankments and flowed into the fields. This was the result of collusion between奸商 (crafty merchants) who contracted to repair this canal and corrupt elements to sabotage the project.

Sabotaging the Promotion of New Agricultural Implements, Medicines and Machinery

The People's Government has been working hard to promote scientific medicines and machinery in rural areas for several years, but illegal capitalists are undermining this work. More than 60 private iron factories in Harbin and Changchun collectively raised bid prices in the production of new agricultural implements, and violated contracts, arbitrarily modifying drawings to cut corners. The weeding knife of the weeder-cultivator was stipulated to be made of one-and-a-half-fen thick iron plate in the contract, but they only used one-fen thick iron plate. As a result, the angle did not meet the specifications and could not remove weeds. The private Pingjin Factory in Tianjin is a factory that manufactures agricultural sprayers. In April 1950, this factory tried every means to cut corners and seek exorbitant profits in undertaking the order of 1,000 sprayers from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. As a result, 800 of the 1,000 sprayers leaked air and water and could not be used. Last summer, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government entrusted merchants Zhou Lianke and others to manufacture cotton aphid soap and cotton oil soap to control cotton aphids. The farmers' comment on this batch of cotton aphid soap was: "It cost money and labor, but it can't control aphids."奸商 (crafty merchants) in Changzhou City, southern Jiangsu, even mixed gypsum powder into fertilizer, which greatly damaged agricultural production.

Cruel Plunder of Disaster Victims

When the people in the disaster areas were trapped in hunger and cold, the people of the whole country did their best to send money and clothes like treating their own brothers; however, illegal capitalists lost their conscience and inserted their blood-sucking tubes into the disaster victims.奸商 (crafty merchants) in Suzhou put the money donated by the people to the disaster victims for cotton clothes into their own pockets, and used clothes made of newspapers and rags to make up the numbers.奸商 (crafty merchants) clapped their hands and celebrated, "I hope there will be cold clothes business next year." In the processing of disaster relief grain for the government, private flour mills in Jinan City seized exorbitant profits of more than 1 billion yuan. In the processing of 190,000 jin of rice for disaster relief, Duan Junting, a奸商 (crafty merchant) in Bengbu City, mixed 70,000 jin of mud and sand into the rice.

Some peasants who had turned over have fallen into extreme poverty again due to the harm of illegal capitalists. The waterwheel bought by Liu Handi, a farmer in Weixian County, did not work well, the vegetables dried up, and the bean cake was wasted. After paying for the waterwheel, he had no food to eat in winter. After the flood in the autumn of 1950, Yang Yizhen, a farmer in Suxian County, had only three dou of wheat left in his family. He sold two dou and bought buckwheat seeds from奸商 (crafty merchant) Wang Tongxuan. He planted seven mu of land, but not a single sprout grew. The whole family had to suffer from cold and hunger. A certain gate on the Huai River failed, and more than 20,000 mu of wheat fields in Laowangpo were submerged, and the farmers had no food or clothing.

Undermining the Government's Credibility

The bourgeoisie's sordid behavior has affected some farmers' trust in the government. After the Jingyan Township area in the suburbs of Zhenjiang City was hit by a flood,奸商 (crafty merchants) handed over moldy and worm-eaten wheat to the farmers through the government as wheat seeds. As a result, the harvest was very bad, which aroused some farmers' dissatisfaction with the government and suspected that the government was deceiving them.奸商 (crafty merchants) in Qinghai Province impersonated the People's Liberation Army and forcibly bought wool from Tibetan people at low prices;奸商 (crafty merchant) Lu Jinxin also impersonated government tax officials and extorted seven silver dollars in "taxes" from the Tibetan people who sold wool; he also spread rumors that the road was not safe and extorted "escort fees." This incident created a very bad impression of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army among the local farmers. Some奸商 (crafty merchants) also attributed the crimes of cutting corners and deceiving farmers to "what the workers did!"

Crushing the Illegal Capitalists' Harm to Farmers

The illegal capitalists' harm to the peasant class has affected the prestige of the People's Government and the consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance. This is not allowed. It is now necessary to carry out the following work:

First, expose the criminal facts of illegal capitalists to the broad masses of peasants, so that the peasants can correctly understand the crimes of illegal capitalists. It is necessary to use peasant gatherings and folk schools, blackboards, reading groups, and oral broadcasts to educate peasants to be vigilant against奸商 (crafty merchants) and guard against being deceived. Every farmer must understand: only by repelling the bourgeoisie's attack, only under the leadership of the Communist Party, and only by uniting closely with the working class, can we effectively develop production and have a bright future.

Second, improve and expand the scope of business activities of rural cooperatives. Cooperatives should use all their strength to organize the economic life of farmers and protect the economic interests that farmers deserve. Cooperatives that have been seriously affected by the bourgeoisie and cannot serve the farmers should be rectified and transformed. Where there are no cooperatives, cooperatives should be established as soon as possible to establish supply and marketing businesses.

Third, state trade organizations should improve and expand the business of purchasing agricultural and sideline products and supplying farmers with necessities. The anti-corruption struggle has eliminated the bourgeois "spies" and corrupt elements lurking in state trade organizations, which is a favorable condition for improving business. State trade organizations should establish more branches in rural market towns as much as possible, strengthen activities in rural areas, meet the needs of farmers for necessities at any time, and purchase local specialties and agricultural products in rural areas.

Fourth, the people's governments in various places should strengthen the management of private industry and commerce. It is necessary to use the Common Program as a guideline to educate private industrialists and merchants to carry out legitimate production and transactions. Illegal capitalists who rob and plunder the fruits of farmers' labor should be warned or even punished according to law, and fulfill the responsibility of the People's Government to protect the interests of the working people.

    违法资本家是怎样坑害农民的
    司马进
    强盗式的诈骗和掠夺
    一九五零年秋天，东北抚顺塔峪区的烟农马景福收下了烟叶。他心想：“这样好的烟叶，不愁卖不到好价钱。”一天，来了一个骑自行车的买主。马景福要十一万元（东北币）一斤，那人只给八万二千元。并说：“今年的烟收成好，可就不是行市。国家种了成万亩的烟，不收购了！”马景福一听八万二千元一斤，气坏了，连说：“不卖！不卖！”打发走了这个买主。接着又一连来了九个买主，都是出一个价，说一样话。马景福坚决不卖。第十一个买主来时，出价八万五千元。马景福犹豫了一阵，终于以八万五千元一斤的价格卖给了第十一个买主。这个谜，直到马景福送货时才识破：原来十一个买主都是一家，都是抚顺奸商李廷商派出去轮番围攻农民、压低烟价的爪牙。
    这是一个真实的故事，但不是唯一的故事。三年来，资产阶级在对工人阶级猖狂进攻同时，也对农民举行了强盗式的掠夺。皖北滁县、肥西一带，常有商人拦住路用很少的钱强购农民运进城里出售的粮食、棉、麻、猪、鸡等。山东潍坊市“上海烟草公司”经理刘英民，在收买农民的黄烟时，指使他的助手们用脚挑着磅盘，用手顶着磅砣，不等磅杆平稳就关磅门，压低分量，劫夺农民的黄烟。垄断了全国菜籽交易、在菜籽行中号称“四大家族”的北京合记、文聚成、聚盛永、华康四家菜籽行，三年来曾卖给农民完全失效的菜籽四千七百多斤。很多地方的奸商都特别为农民预备劣货，花言巧语地哄骗农民，高价出售。东北和山东都发现木商用旧棺木做饭具出售。农民买回去蒸饭，弄得尸臭满锅。川西大邑县的农民在成都买剃头刀，商人说是“上海货”，“保险货”，买回去却剃不下头发。川南乐山县商州乡农民把竹参卖给商人，每两五百元；商人运到宜宾（距商州乡二百三十五里），每两卖八千元。违法商店的老板，以酒中掺水、白糖掺面、坏毛线织成新毛衣、十二两算一斤等卑劣手段，大量抢劫农民的劳动果实。
    破坏农民的合作社
    违法资本家十分敌视合作社。半社会主义性质的合作社是在国营经济领导下，把农民组织起来，使农民摆脱商人中间剥削，走向社会主义的道路。资产阶级把合作社当成了眼中之钉。很多地方的商人组织了“联营社”，专门对抗农民的合作社。他们欺骗农民说：“合作社为社员服务，‘联营社’为群众服务。”他们把“联营社”称为“新合作社”。某地工商联负责人公开号召私商“组织起来与合作社斗争，和合作社拚拚”；并狂言：“非把合作社斗垮不可！”商人们看见社员在合作社买肉，就造谣说：“社员买肉记上了本本，将来要上税，要算剥削账，说你大吃大喝。”为了挤垮合作社，奸商们还用小恩小惠拉拢合作社的干部和区乡领导干部，或派遣“坐探”打入合作社，盗窃国家经济情报，里应外合地破坏合作社。在南京郊区的十八个供销合作社中，奸商们派进了二十多个“坐探”。天津某奸商钻入合作社，盗窃合作社大量公款，自己开工厂，做了许多劣货，再通过合作社系统高价硬售给农民。
    破坏水利建设
    兴修水利，是恢复和发展农业生产的重要环节之一。人民政府成立以来，就大力兴修水利，扶助农民治河开渠，以提高农业生产。但是，违法资本家却在水利工程中肆意破坏，牟取暴利。治淮工程中，从测量、设计、采购、疏浚到做土方、修涵洞，无处不是资产阶级发财的机会。上海、汉口两地奸商盗骗国家财产及造成工程上的损失达二百亿元。奸商卖出的流速仪失效，使淮河及其支流水文记录不确，使治淮工程的设计失去可靠的凭据，严重影响了工程的进行。陕西省大荔县能灌溉四十二万亩田的洛惠渠，不少工程修成后发现漏水裂缝。田里需要水的时候不能浇，不需要水的时候，水却决口流到田里。这是承修这条渠的奸商勾结贪污分子进行破坏的结果。
    破坏新式农具药械推广工作
    人民政府几年来一直努力在农村推广科学药械，违法资本家却在破坏这一工作。哈尔滨、长春两市六十多家私营铁工厂在承制新式农具中，集体抬高标价，并破坏合同，任意修改图样以偷工减料。铲趟机的除草刀，合同规定用一分半厚的铁板，他们只用一分厚的铁板。结果角度不合规格，除不掉草。天津市私营平津工厂是制造农用喷雾器的工厂。一九五零年四月间，这个厂在承制中央人民政府农业部一千架喷雾器的定货中，想尽办法偷工减料，牟取暴利。结果，一千架喷雾器有八百架漏气漏水，不能使用。去年夏季，山西省人民政府曾委托商人周连科等制造防治棉蚜的棉蚜皂和棉油皂。农民对这批棉蚜皂的评语是：“花了钱，费了工，治不了蚜虫。”苏南常州市的奸商更在肥田粉中渗入石膏粉，大大损害了农业生产。
    对灾民也残酷掠夺
    当灾区人民陷于饥寒交迫的困境时，全国人民像对待亲弟兄一样地尽力送款、送衣服；违法资本家却丧尽天良，把吸血管插到了灾民身上。苏州市的奸商把人民捐给灾胞的棉衣代金装起来，用报纸、破布做的衣服来充数。奸商们额手庆贺，“希望明年还有寒衣生意”。济南市各私营面粉厂在为政府的救灾粮加工中，攫取暴利在十亿元以上。蚌埠市奸商段君亭在救灾粮十九万斤大米的加工中，掺入泥沙七万斤。
    若干翻身农民，在违法资本家的坑害下，重陷于极端贫困的境地。潍县农民刘汉弟买的水车不好使，青菜干死了，豆饼白使了。交出水车钱，冬天没有饭吃。宿县农民杨义振在一九五零年秋大水后，全家只剩了三斗小麦。他卖出两斗，买了奸商王同宣的荞麦种。种了七亩地，一颗芽也没生。一家大小只好挨冻受饿。淮河某闸门失效，老王坡被淹没麦田两万余亩，农民衣食无着。
    破坏政府的威信
    资产阶级的龌龊行为，影响了某些农民对政府的信赖。镇江市郊京砚乡一带遭水灾后，奸商把发霉生虫的麦子通过政府之手交给农民做麦种，结果收成很坏，引起部分农民对政府的不满，怀疑政府欺骗他们。青海省的奸商冒充人民解放军，强用低价收买藏民的羊毛；奸商卢进新又冒充政府税务员，敲诈了卖羊毛的藏民七块银元的“税款”；还造谣说路上不平安，勒索“保镖费”。这一事件，在当地农民中造成对人民政府与解放军的极坏的印象。还有的奸商把偷工减料、欺骗农民的罪行，说成是“工人做的事！”
    粉碎违法资本家对农民的坑害
    违法资本家对农民阶级的坑害，影响了人民政府的威信，也影响了工农联盟的巩固和发展。这是不能允许的。现在有必要进行以下的工作：
    第一，向广大农民群众揭发违法资本家的罪恶事实，使农民能正确认识违法资本家的罪行。要利用农民的集会和民校、黑板报、读报小组和口头广播，教育农民对奸商提高警惕，谨防上当。要让每一个农民都懂得：只有打退资产阶级的进攻，只有在共产党领导之下，紧紧地和工人阶级团结在一起，才能有效地发展生产，才有美好的前途。
    第二，要改善和扩展农村合作社的业务活动范围。合作社应该以一切力量组织农民的经济生活，保障农民应得的经济利益。对于那些受了资产阶级严重影响，不能为农民服务的合作社，应当进行整顿和改造。没有合作社的地方，应该尽快地成立合作社，建立供销业务。
    第三，国家贸易机构应当改进和扩展收购农副业生产品的业务，和对农民必需品的供应工作。反贪污斗争肃清了潜伏在国家贸易机构中的资产阶级
    “坐探”和贪污分子，这是改进业务的有利条件。国家贸易机构应该尽可能在农村集镇增设分支机构，并加强下乡活动，随时满足农民对必需品的要求，并收购农村的土产特产和农产品。
    第四，各地人民政府应该加强对私营工商业的管理工作。要以共同纲领为准绳，教育私营工商业者实行正当的生产和交易。对于抢劫、掠夺农民劳动果实的违法资本家，应予以警告乃至依法惩办，尽到人民政府保护劳动人民利益的责任。
