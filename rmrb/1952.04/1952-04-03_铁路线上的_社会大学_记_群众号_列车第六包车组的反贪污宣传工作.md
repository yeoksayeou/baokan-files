    The "Social University" on the Railway Line
    —On the Anti-Corruption Propaganda Work of the Sixth Chartered Carriage Group of the "Masses" Train
    Zheng Yaozhong
    When the "Masses" passenger train is mentioned, people give it a thumbs-up. It is not only that the staff on the train takes good care of the passengers, but also that the passengers feel like they are in a "social university" when they are on the train, feeling not like they are traveling, but listening to lectures or watching dramas.
    After the launch of the anti-corruption movement, the sixth chartered carriage group of the "Masses" passenger train organized car inspectors, conductors, broadcasters, train captains, railway police officers, baggage handlers, and vendors to carry out anti-corruption propaganda to the masses and capture fleeing corrupt elements. They made guarantees to each other: the propaganda team guaranteed to speak clearly and fluently with correct content; law enforcement personnel guaranteed to pay attention to the passengers' movements and discover clues in a timely manner; the train captain carried out patrols and command; conductors, baggage handlers, vendors, etc. paid attention to the doors and both sides of the train to prevent corrupt elements from jumping off the train or other accidents. Their slogan was: Do not let a single "tiger" escape. With this arrangement of a "tiger" catching formation, coupled with moving propaganda, many corrupt elements revealed their true colors under the thousands of eyes of the masses.
    This happened on February 16th. The train was heading from Shenyang to Beijing, and between Xinmin and Liuhegou, the propaganda team had already publicized to the third carriage. Zhu Fengshan and Gao Shaohua were singing "Old Chen Confesses" (a rhythmic story-telling). When the propaganda reached the point of "Speaking of 'Three Antis,' it's not imprisonment, if you don't talk, others will talk for you. Old Chen couldn't figure it out for days, and felt uneasy all the time," the train captain, Lu Xin, discovered a person in the carriage wearing a cadre uniform, with a shaved head, staring wide-eyed, looking out the window. Beads of sweat on his head rolled down like beans. This person was completely different from others. The train captain paid attention to him. Watching the man quietly take off his cotton trousers and put them on the luggage rack, he wanted to change his cotton-padded jacket again. This was really strange! It wasn't too hot in the carriage, so why was he sweating so much? Why did he want to change his clothes? The train captain and law enforcement personnel asked him, and also found that he was carrying eight million yuan and two swimming watches. At this time, the propaganda had already reached "'Three Antis' is a life-saving boat, I am saved thanks to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao's goodness is endless…," the person showed a look of shame. After questioning, he admitted that he was from the Shenyang Enterprise Company, named Meng Xiangsheng, and had embezzled a lot of money in the past and wanted to escape this time.
    No matter how many tricks corrupt elements have, they cannot escape the palms of the people. Here is a vivid example. This happened on March 7th. The "Masses" train was traveling from Beijing to Jilin. The propaganda team on the train and the propaganda team of the Tianjin Art Theater were carrying out propaganda. In the third carriage, after the Tianjin Art Theater finished singing "Aunt Wang Advises Her Uncle to Confess Quickly," the train crew's propaganda team sang the "Lotus Drop" of "Thoroughly Fight a Beautiful Battle." They beat bamboo clappers, singing sentence after sentence:
    …Originally there were quite a few problems, he pretended to be a good person and didn't say anything;
    His mind is still focused on making money, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial.
    Wanting to muddle through, is that possible? The masses will not agree!…
    These words stung a big corrupt element—Zheng Xiangchun, an administrator of a certain department of the public security department of a special commissioner's office in Hunan Province—making his face ashen and panicked. In the applause of the passengers, he didn't even dare to raise his head. He stood up and wanted to go out. But he couldn't even move his legs, so he had to hold on to the seat and shuffle towards the door. The train captain looked at him in the doorway and asked, "Comrade, where are you going?" "Oh! To the toilet!" he replied. Clearly the toilet was at the other end, where the performers were, so why was he coming this way? So the train captain asked again: "Are you going to defecate? There's no toilet here!" "Oh! Oh! Not defecating!" "Are you going to urinate?" the train captain asked again. At this time, he said fearfully, "It's okay without a toilet, I don't need to urinate!"
    This matter seems strange, but it is actually not strange. Corrupt elements are like "rats" in the crowd, and those with discerning eyes can tell at a glance. The train captain and law enforcement personnel had already seen that there was a problem with this person. The "Lotus Drop" became more and more energetic; "You have the eyes of a mouse and the guts of a sparrow, sitting in a well and looking at the sky, you can't see the whole picture! Some cadres have a bad style, because bourgeois ideology is at work"…
    The law enforcement squad leader and the train captain questioned this person, at which point he produced a fake passport (which he had issued himself), as well as a "discharge certificate," a "mentally ill" patient certificate, a certificate of exemption from office due to "illness," and a "revolutionary disabled soldier" certificate (all fake). How "grand and imposing" this was! Need proof? There are four or five. Are you saying I'm a corrupt element? I say I am a "mentally ill" patient. At this time, the "Lotus Drop" was nearing its end, and people clearly heard:
    …Take off your pants, take off your coat, take off your socks, expose your feet; all are in the "Three Antis" movement, taking a clean bath. Suppress the bourgeois attack and establish a new social ethos!
    Chairman Mao has a call: for increasing production, for saving…
    On the "Three Antis" front, fight a thoroughly beautiful battle!…
    The train captain and law enforcement personnel again explained the policy to him, explaining that confession was the only way out, and he then confessed the facts of embezzling 7 million yuan in RMB and 200,000 jin of rice, etc. He said, "I plan to go home to Haicheng. I am truly sorry to Chairman Mao and the people. I will definitely go back and confess thoroughly and ask the higher authorities to punish me."

    铁路线上的“社会大学”
    ——记“群众号”列车第六包车组的反贪污宣传工作
    郑耀中
    提起“群众号”旅客列车来，人们都翘起大拇指。不单是车上的工作人员对旅客照顾得好，而且旅客坐在车里，就像进了“社会大学”一样，觉得不是在旅行，而是在听讲演或看剧。
    反贪污运动开展后，“群众号”旅客列车第六包车组把检车车电员、列车员、广播员、车长、乘警人员、行李员、贩卖员等组织起来，向群众进行反贪污宣传，捕捉逃跑的贪污分子。他们互相提出保证：宣传组保证说得清楚流利，内容正确；执法人员保证注意旅客动态，及时发现线索；车长进行巡视、指挥；列车员、行李员、贩卖员等注意车门和两侧，防备贪污分子跳车或发生其他事故。他们的口号是：不使一个“老虎”脱逃。这样布置了捉“虎”阵势，再加上动人的宣传，在群众千百只眼睛下面，使很多贪污分子现了原形。
    这是二月十六日的事情。列车由沈阳开向北京，走到新民、柳河沟间，宣传组已经宣传到第三个车厢。朱凤山和高绍华唱着“老陈坦白”（数来宝）。在宣传到“说‘三反’，不是关，你要不谈别人给你谈。老陈几天没想通，时时刻刻心不安”的时候，车长卢信，在车厢里发现一个穿干部服的人，光着头，瞪大了眼睛，向窗外看着。头上的汗珠像豆粒一般直往下滚。这个人和别人完全不一样。车长注意了他。看着那人悄悄地把棉裤脱下来，放到了行李架上，还想再换棉袄。这真是奇事呵！车里面并不太热，他怎么直出汗？为什么要换衣服？车长和执法人员来问他，又检查出他带有八百万元和两块游泳表。这时已经宣传到“‘三反’就是救生船，救我多亏共产党，毛主席的好处说不完……”，那个人表现出惭愧的样子。经过询问，他承认是沈阳企业公司的，名叫孟祥生，过去贪污了很多钱，这次想逃跑。
    贪污分子的花招不管有多少，也是逃不出人民的手掌。这里有一个生动的例子。这是三月七日的事。“群众号”列车由北京开往吉林。车上的宣传组和天津艺术剧院的宣传组正在宣传。在第三节车厢里，天津艺术剧院演唱完“王二婶劝她大叔快坦白”以后，车班宣传组就演唱“彻底打个漂亮仗”的“莲花落”。他们打着竹板，一句叠一句地唱着：
    ……本来问题倒挺多，假装好人他不说；
    思想还在钻钱眼，避重就轻说不点。
    想要混过去能不能？群众可是不答应！……
    这些话像针尖似地刺痛了一个大贪污分子——湖南省一个专署公安部门的某部管理员郑祥春，使他脸如死灰，惊慌失措。他在满车旅客鼓掌欢迎声中，连头也不敢抬。他站起身来，想走出去。但是，他连腿也拉不动，只得扶着座位蹭向车门。车长在车门里看着他，问他：“同志，上那去？”“哦！上厕所！”他回答着。明明厕所是在演唱人员的那一头，他为什么向这面来呢？于是车长又问：“大便吗？这边没有厕所啊！”“哦！哦！不大便！”“小便吗？”车长又问一句。这时，他恐惧地说：“没有厕所也行了，不溺了！”
    这件事看起来奇怪，实际是不奇怪的。贪污分子在人群里像“老鼠”一样，明眼人一看便知。车长和执法人员已经看出这个人有问题了。“莲花落”越说越有劲；“你耗子眼睛麻雀胆，坐井观天看不点！有的干部作风坏，因为资产阶级思想来作怪”……
    执法班长和车长盘问着这个人，这时，他拿出了假护照来（这护照是他自己开的），又拿出一个“出院证”和一个“精神病”患者证明，一个因“病”免职的证明，一个“革命残废军人”的证明（都是假的），这是多么“冠冕堂皇”呵！要证明吗？有四、五个。你说我是贪污分子吗？我说我是“精神病”患者。这时的“莲花落”已接近尾声了，人们都清楚地听到：
    ……脱了裤子脱掉袄，扒去袜子露出脚；都在“三反”运动中，光溜溜地洗个澡。把资产阶级进攻压下去，建立新社会的新风气！
    毛主席，有号召：为增产，为节约，……
    要在“三反”战线上，彻底打个漂亮仗！……
    车长和执法人员又向他交代了政策，说明坦白是唯一的出路，他才谈出贪污了人民币七百万元和大米二十万斤等等的贪污事实。他说：“我打算回家回到海城去。我真对不起毛主席，对不起人民，我一定回去彻底坦白，请求上级给我处分。”
