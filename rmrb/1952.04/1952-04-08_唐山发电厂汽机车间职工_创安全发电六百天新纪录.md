    Tangshan Power Plant Turbine Workshop Employees
    Set New Record of 600 Days of Safe Power Generation
    The employees of the Tangshan Power Plant Turbine Workshop have placed great emphasis on safe production. As of March 27th, they had created a new plant record of 600 days of safe power generation.
    After the start of the anti-corruption struggle, the plant assigned specific personnel to be responsible for leading production and stipulated that administrative foremen and union group leaders would be responsible for safe power transmission, and selected activists to be responsible for safeguarding the safety of the entire workshop. All employees were able to resolutely implement all systems in their work. Each shift conscientiously implemented safety operating procedures and accident handling procedures; production review meetings were held regularly every week. If anyone made a mistake in their work, points were deducted according to the "point deduction system"; at the end of the month, each shift was rated based on the number of mistakes made. The system of studying technology was also implemented as usual. As a result, the Turbine Workshop has not had any accidents and has completed the task of 600 days of safe power transmission.

    唐山发电厂汽机车间职工
    创安全发电六百天新纪录
    唐山发电厂汽机车间职工重视安全生产，到三月二十七日为止，创造了安全发电六百天的全厂新纪录。
    反贪污斗争开始后，这个厂分配专人负责领导生产，并规定行政领班、工会小组长负责安全发送电，抽调积极分子负责保卫全车间安全。全体职工也都能坚决执行工作上的一切制度。各班值班时认真执行安全操作规程、事故处理规程；每周照例召开生产检讨会。如有人在工作中发生错误，按“减分制度”减少分数；月终时每班按发生错误次数的多少，评定分数等级。学习技术的制度也照常执行。汽机车间因此没发生过任何事故，完成六百天安全发送电的任务。（史连楹、金森）
