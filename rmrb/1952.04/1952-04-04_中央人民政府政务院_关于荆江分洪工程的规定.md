Due to the narrow and silted river channel and downstream bends of the Jingjiang section of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, it cannot discharge large amounts of floodwater, and the dikes are more than ten meters above the ground. During the flood season, flood peaks approach, and dangerous conditions occur frequently, with the risk of breaches. If a breach occurs, not only will the vast Jianghan Plain be flooded, but it will also affect navigation on the Yangtze River, and it will be difficult to close the breach and deal with the aftermath in the short term. If there is no breach, the rise in the Yangtze River's water level will inevitably increase the amount of water flowing into Dongting Lake from the four outlets (Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, Tiaoxian), and most of the dikes around the lake will be breached. To protect the lives and property of millions of people in Hubei and Hunan, strengthening the Jingjiang Dike and opening up a flood diversion area on the south bank is an urgent measure before the Yangtze River's fundamental treatment project is completed.

After the completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, if an abnormal flood occurs in the Yangtze River and flood diversion is needed, it can reduce the threat of flooding to the Jingjiang Dike and reduce the amount of floodwater flowing into Dongting Lake from the four outlets. At the same time, doing a good job in the flood diversion area's construction can ensure that the area around the lake is not harmed by flood diversion. This measure is beneficial to the people of Hubei and Hunan. To this end, the Government Administration Council hereby makes the following provisions:

    (1) In 1952, the focus will still be on consolidating the Jingjiang Dike, which must be vigorously strengthened to ensure that it does not breach. The necessary funds may be increased as appropriate. The specific construction plan and budget shall be drafted by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission in conjunction with the Hubei Provincial People's Government and completed within a time limit.

    (2) Before the flood season in 1952, the construction of the enclosure dikes, control gates, and flood gates in the south bank flood diversion area should be guaranteed to be completed, and the quality of the project should be effectively strengthened. The required manpower should be borne separately by Hubei, Hunan, and the troops.

    (3) There are no plans to divert floodwater in 1952. If an abnormal flood occurs in the Yangtze River that threatens the final safety of the Jingjiang Dike, flood diversion may be considered if the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been completed, but it must be reported to the Government Administration Council by the Central South Military and Political Committee for approval.

    (4) The resettlement work for the Hubei Province flood diversion area should be completed before the flood season.

    (5) Regarding the issue of flood storage on the north bank of the Yangtze River, reconnaissance and surveying work should be organized immediately, and it should be compared and studied with other fundamental treatment plans before a decision is made.

    (6) To successfully complete the major projects of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion in 1952, the Central South Military and Political Committee shall be responsible for forming a strong Jingjiang Flood Diversion Committee and a flood diversion project command organization, with representatives from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the People's Governments of Hunan and Hubei Provinces, and the troops participating in the project, and capable cadres designated by the Central South Military and Political Committee to serve as the director and deputy director. The administrative and technical personnel of the project command organization shall be transferred from relevant units.

The above-mentioned projects must be carried out with careful preparation due to the urgency of time, and it must be guaranteed that they will be completed on schedule. As for manpower, materials, transportation, and technology, if the strength of the Central South is insufficient, a specific plan must be submitted and quickly reported to the Government Administration Council for resolution.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于荆江分洪工程的规定
    长江中游荆江段由于河道狭窄淤垫，下游弯曲，不能承泄大量洪水，且堤身高出地面十数公尺，每当汛期，洪峰逼临，险工迭出，时有溃决的危险。如一旦溃决，不仅江汉广大平原遭受淹没，并将影响长江通航，且在短期内难以堵口善后。不决，则以长江水位抬高，由四口（松滋、太平、藕池、调弦）注入洞庭湖的水量势必增多，滨湖多数堤垸必遭溃决。为保障两湖千百万人民生命财产的安全起见，在长江治本工程未完成以前，加固荆江大堤并在南岸开辟分洪区乃是当前急迫需要的措施。
    荆江分洪工程完成以后，如长江发生异常洪水需要分洪时，既可减轻洪水对荆江大堤的威胁，并可减少四口注入洞庭湖的洪量；同时，做好分洪区工程又能保障滨湖区不因分洪而受危害。这一措施对湖北、湖南人民都是有利的。为此，本院特作下列规定：
    （一）一九五二年仍以巩固荆江大堤为重点，必须大力加强，保证不致溃决，其所需经费可酌予增加。具体施工计划及预算由长江水利委员会会同湖北省人民政府拟订，限期完成。
    （二）一九五二年汛前应保证完成南岸分洪区围堤及节制闸、进洪闸等工程，并切实加强工程质量。其所需人力，应由湖北、湖南和部队分别负担。
    （三）一九五二年不拟分洪。如万一长江发生异常洪水威胁荆江大堤的最后安全，在荆江分洪工程业已完成的条件下，可以考虑分洪，但必须由中南军政委员会报请政务院批准。
    （四）湖北省分洪区移民工作应于汛前完成。
    （五）关于长江北岸的蓄洪问题，应即组织察勘测量工作，并与其他治本计划加以比较研究后再行确定。
    （六）为胜利完成一九五二年荆江分洪各主要工程，应由中南军政委员会负责组成一强有力的荆江分洪委员会和分洪工程指挥机构，由长江水利委员会、湖南、湖北两省人民政府及参加工程的部队派人参加，并由中南军政委员会指派得力干部任正副主任。工程指挥机构的行政与技术人员由各有关单位调配。
    上述各项工程，因时间紧迫必须抓紧时机进行周密的准备工作，并保证按期完成。至于人力、器材、运输及技术等方面，如中南力量不足时，得提出具体计划，速报请政务院予以解决。
                           一九五二年三月三十一日
