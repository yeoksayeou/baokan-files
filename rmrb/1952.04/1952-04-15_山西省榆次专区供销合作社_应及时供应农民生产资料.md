    Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Shanxi Province
    Should Supply Farmers' Means of Production in a Timely Manner
    Comrade Editor: The Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Shanxi Province is not supplying farmers' means of production in a timely and sufficient manner, causing great dissatisfaction among the local farmers. The Shouyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative estimated that farmers needed 270,000 jin of ferrous sulfate and reported to the Special District Cooperative to allocate and sell the full amount, but the Special District Cooperative only agreed to supply 100,000 jin, and later changed it to 40,000 jin; even this 40,000 jin has been delayed by the Special District Cooperative until now (more than a month) and has not been issued. Although the Shouyang County Cooperative has sent telegrams to urge them, the Special District Cooperative has ignored them. Now that the Qingming Festival has passed and farmers have begun sowing, they have reflected: "We only hear thunder, but we don't see rain", "The publicity is early, but it can't catch up with the need". The supply of other items, such as waterwheels and new agricultural implements, is also similar. We hope that the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative will quickly resolve this issue.

### 山西省榆次专区供销合作社  应及时供应农民生产资料

    山西省榆次专区供销合作社
    应及时供应农民生产资料
    编辑同志：山西省榆次专区供销合作社，不及时和不充分地供应农民生产资料，引起当地农民群众极大不满。寿阳县供销社统计农民需要黑矾二十七万斤，曾报请专区社照数拨给发售，但专区社只答应供给十万斤，后又改为四万斤；就是这四万斤，专区社也是拖延至今（已有一月多）还没发下，虽经寿阳县社去电催促，专区社仍置之不理。现在清明节已过，农民已开始下种，他们纷纷反映：“只听响雷，不见下雨”，“宣传的倒是早，就是赶不上用”。其他如水车、新式农具等供应工作，也有类似情况。希望榆次专区供销合作社迅速解决这个问题。
