    A section of Tianjin Municipality's vocational schools
    Achieves Results in Experiment with Accelerated Literacy Method
    To promote the Qi Jianhua Accelerated Literacy Method, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau organized an experimental class at the Second Mass Vocational School in the city's Tenth District in January of this year. Recently, experimental classes have been opened in several vocational and mass vocational schools in the Second, Third, Eighth, and Eleventh Districts of the city. The Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau is currently drafting a plan to first train a group of teachers to promote the accelerated literacy method, and then widely apply the accelerated literacy method throughout the city to promote literacy education.
    The initial trial implementation of the Qi Jianhua Accelerated Literacy Method in Tianjin has had good results and has been warmly welcomed by workers, citizens, and female students. The students' enthusiasm for learning is very high, and their progress is significant. For example, in the accelerated class experiment at the Second Mass Vocational School in the Tenth District of the city, the fifty students originally knew an average of only about 400 characters each (the least literate only knew 124 characters). However, by using the Qi Jianhua Accelerated Literacy Method, first intensively studying phonetic symbols and practicing pinyin, and then intensively studying new characters, practicing writing, and reading, in just twenty-three days, the average number of characters recognized by each person increased to 1,672, with the most literate being able to recognize 1,842 characters, and even the least literate being able to recognize 939 characters. For example, Niu Shiqing, a shop assistant, originally only knew 409 characters, but now he can not only recognize more than 1,700 characters, but also explain, write, and use these more than 1,700 characters, and has a certain level of reading and writing ability, being able to generally understand "Branch Life," "North China People," and the Tianjin Daily. He wrote a letter to his teacher, Cui Shuju, in which he expressed his deep gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao and decided to work harder in his studies and work. He is now acting as a "little teacher" to teach others to read. Another example is Qiu Wenhua, an elderly woman in her fifties, who originally only knew 330 characters and had difficulty writing and reading, but after intensive study of phonetic symbols, practicing pinyin, and intensively studying new characters, she was able to read and speak, and even write about the key points of propaganda against germ warfare (she has become a street propagandist). Currently, the experimental class of the Sixteenth Vocational School in the Eleventh District of the city, which is undergoing experimentation, has 66 students who, in nine hours, learned all the phonetic symbols from easy to difficult, and some were even able to "move house" (being able to recognize and pronounce them independently in any situation, regardless of the order of the phonetic symbols, is called "moving house"). After learning the phonetic symbols, they intensively recognized 407 characters in four hours (average score). In their spare time, the teachers also sang songs with the students to boost morale, so their enthusiasm for intensive literacy was even greater. The students in the experimental classes in various schools have a strong desire to turn over culturally. They know that this method is really good, but to learn well, they must concentrate and study hard, and not take shortcuts or slack off. Therefore, they are all determined to persevere to the end. The students' spirit of not fearing difficulties and studying hard is an important condition for learning culture well by relying on the accelerated literacy method.

    天津市的一部分职工业余学校
    速成识字法实验取得成绩
    天津市教育局为了推行祁建华速成识字法，曾于今年一月间在该市十区第二群众业余学校组织速成班实验了一期，最近又先后在该市二区、三区、八区、十一区等几处职工业余学校和群众业余学校的几个班开课实验。目前天津市教育局正草拟计划，准备先行培养一批推行速成识字法的教师，然后在全市广泛应用速成识字法，推行识字教育。
    祁建华速成识字法在天津市初步试行的效果是良好的，受到了职工、市民和妇女学员的热烈欢迎。学员们的学习情绪非常高，成绩也大。如在该市十区第二群众业余学校开班实验的速成班，五十个学员原来平均每人只认得四百字左右（最低者仅识一百二十四个字），由于采用了祁建华速成识字法，先突击学习注音符号、练习拼音，然后突击学习生字、练习写话和阅读，仅仅二十三天的时间，平均每人认字已增至一千六百七十二个，最高的能认到一千八百四十二个字，最低的也能认得九百三十九个字。如店员牛世庆原来只认得四百零九个字，目前他不仅能认识一千七百多字，而且能讲解、书写和运用这一千七百多字，并且具有了一定的阅读和写作能力，大体上能看懂“支部生活”、“华北人民”和天津日报。他给教他的老师崔树菊写了一封信，他说他对党和毛主席表示万分感激，决定加倍努力学习，积极工作，现在他正当小先生教别人认字。又如另一个学员邱文华，是一个五十多岁的老太太，原来只认得三百三十个字，写和读都有困难，但经过突击学习注音符号、练习拼音、突击学习生字等步骤之后，居然能读也能讲，甚至也能写有关反对细菌战的宣传要点了（她已当了街道宣传员）。现正进行实验的该市十一区第十六职工业余学校的实验班的六十六个学员，在九小时内，由易到难地进行突击学习，学会了全部注音符号，有些并且能够“搬家”（不依注音符号的顺序，在任何情况下也能单独认出、念出，就叫“搬家”）了；注音符号学会后，在四小时内，突击认得了四百零七个字（平均成绩）。课余时间，教员还和学员一块唱歌，鼓舞情绪，因而突击识字的劲头也更足了。各校实验班学员在文化上要求翻身的意志昂扬，他们知道，这个方法是真好，可是要学习得好，就非集中精神用心学不可，一点也不能取巧和松劲。所以他们都有决心认真坚持到底。学员们不怕困难，努力学习的精神，是依靠速成识字法学好文化的重要条件。
