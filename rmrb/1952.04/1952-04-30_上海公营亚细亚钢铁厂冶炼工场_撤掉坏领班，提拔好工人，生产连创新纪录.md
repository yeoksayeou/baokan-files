Shanghai Public Asia Steel Factory Smelting Workshop
Remove Bad Foremen, Promote Good Workers, Production Continuously Breaks New Records

    The Shanghai Public Asia Steel Factory Smelting Workshop removed Wang A'yi, a foreman who oppressed workers and embezzled state assets, and promoted workers Zhuang Hongyou and Wang Qingyuan to serve as acting foremen, creating a new record for extending the lifespan of steelmaking furnaces. After the "Three-Anti" Movement unfolded, materials exposed by employees proved that Wang A'yi was not only bad in his work style and oppressive to workers, but also colluded with another foreman, Xu Baorong, to steal valuable metals such as chromium, ?, and molybdenum from the smelting of alloy steel. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, although the leadership repeatedly educated him, he still refused to confess. In mid-March, based on the demands of the employees, the leadership ordered Wang A'yi to remain at the factory for self-reflection and Xu Baorong to be suspended for self-reflection. At the same time, the factory affairs meeting approved the promotion of workers Zhuang Hongyou and Wang Qingyuan to acting foreman positions.

    When Wang A'yi remained at the factory for self-reflection, it was just when the Bessemer converter in the smelting workshop was about to start steelmaking. The leadership was afraid that the production of the Bessemer converter would be affected after Wang A'yi left, so they convened a meeting of employees to study the issue. The workers said on the spot: "Even if Wang A'yi is not here, we will still produce, and the output will only be higher, not lower." After the meeting, the workers on the Bessemer converter and the workers on the cupola furnace conducted further research and made a guarantee to the leadership: to extend the furnace life to more than 20 heats, reduce accidents, reduce waste products, and complete the March task; and to make up for the production quantities that were not completed in January and February. The employees also used these conditions to challenge the electric furnace workers.

    There are two important keys to increasing steel production: one is to shorten the furnace repair and smelting time, and the other is to maintain the furnace well and extend the furnace life. The workers put their minds to these two problems and came up with solutions.

    The Bessemer converter and the cupola furnace were originally a production unit. The two furnaces are side by side, and the molten iron from the cupola furnace flows directly into the Bessemer converter to be blown into steel. They should be closely related to each other. However, when Wang A'yi was in charge, due to his poor management methods, you blew your steel and I melted my iron, and they did not communicate with each other. Sometimes the Bessemer converter had already stopped for repairs, but the cupola furnace was still melting as usual, which often resulted in the waste of molten iron. After Lu Shunqi, a member of the Youth League, was promoted to lead the cupola furnace, he took the initiative to discuss with Tan A'liu, who was in charge of the Bessemer converter, and decided that when the Bessemer converter needed to be repaired, the cupola furnace employees should be notified to stop melting first. Except for the workers who need to be retained for ironmaking preparation, the rest of the people help the Bessemer converter workers mix sand and mud and repair the furnace. This not only shortened the furnace repair time, but also avoided the waste of molten iron.

    Under the leadership of acting foreman Zhuang Hongyou, the electric furnace workers automatically launched a labor competition among the three shifts. The feeding time was shortened from 30 minutes to 12 minutes per batch, and the smelting time was shortened from two heats in eight hours to two heats in seven hours.

    Employees also came up with various ways to protect the furnace so that it could smelt more heats of molten steel. Lu Shunqi of the cupola furnace came up with a way to reduce the composition of limestone in the furnace, so that the slag of the iron could flow out quickly, making it less likely to damage the refractory materials in the furnace. In the past, the ventilation eye on the Bessemer converter would break after every 15 or 16 heats, and it could no longer be smelted. When Wang A'yi was in charge, the workers had repeatedly tried to hot-patch the ventilation eye, but never succeeded. This time, under the leadership of Tan A'liu, the workers threw fire mud from the top of the furnace, braving the high temperature emitted from the furnace, and gradually moved the fire mud to the ventilation eye, successfully hot-patching it, allowing the furnace that could no longer be smelted to continue blowing. Therefore, the production of the Bessemer converter was greatly improved. In the past, the furnace life was often only 15 or 16 heats, with a maximum of only 22 heats, and sometimes the furnace would break after only 5 or 6 heats. Recently, the workers have continuously created new records of 23 heats per time for three times, which is one heat higher than the previous record. On April 2, the Bessemer converter set a new record of blowing 24 heats. At present, the employees of the Bessemer converter and the cupola furnace have carried out new reforms, changing the original manpower from two shifts to three shifts, and increasing the number of steelmaking from twice a week to three times. The workers said: "After Wang A'yi was transferred away, we felt relaxed and happy from the bottom of our hearts, and we were able to work smoothly and easily." The March plan task of the Bessemer converter increased by 50 tons compared to January, and the result was 107.9 percent completion. If it were not for the two shutdowns waiting for materials, the workers would have certainly achieved the guarantee 100 percent and made up for the production shortages in January and February. The electric furnace also completed 149.1 percent of the production plan in March. (Bai Liuyuan)

    上海公营亚细亚钢铁厂冶炼工场
    撤掉坏领班，提拔好工人，生产连创新纪录
    上海公营亚细亚钢铁厂冶炼工场，撤掉了欺压工人、贪污国家资财的领班王阿义，提拔工人庄洪友、王庆源等担任代理领班后，创造了延长炼钢炉寿命的新纪录。“三反”运动展开后，根据职工检举出来的材料，证明王阿义不但作风恶劣，欺压工人，且伙同另一领班徐宝荣，盗卖炼制合金钢中的贵重金属——铬、?、钼等。在“三反”运动中，领导方面虽曾对他再三进行教育，但他仍拒不坦白。三月中旬，领导方面根据职工要求，令王阿义留厂反省、徐宝荣停职反省。同时，厂务会议通过，提拔工人庄洪友、王庆源等代理领班职务。
    王阿义留厂反省的时候，正是冶炼工场贝氏炉快要开炉炼钢的时候。领导方面怕王阿义离开后，贝氏炉生产会受到影响，便召集职工群众开会研究。工人当场就说：“王阿义不在，我们照样生产，而且产量只会高不会低。”会后，贝氏炉上的工人和化铁炉上的工人又进行了研究，向领导方面提出了保证：延长炉龄到二十炉以上，减少事故，少出废品，完成三月份任务；并补足一、二月份没有完成的生产数量。职工还拿这些条件向电炉工人挑战。
    炼钢产量的提高，有两个重要关键：一个是缩短修炉和冶炼时间，一个是保养好炉子，延长炉龄。工人便在这两个问题上动脑筋，想办法。
    贝氏炉和化铁炉本来是一个生产单位，两个炉子并列在一起，化铁炉熔好的铁水，直接流入贝氏炉吹炼成钢。相互间应该是息息相关的。但王阿义在的时候，由于他的管理方法不好，你吹你的钢，我熔我的铁，互不通气。有时贝氏炉已停炉修补，化铁炉却仍照常熔炼，以致经常发生浪费铁水的情况。青年团员陆顺祺被提拔担任化铁炉领导工作以后，便主动和担任贝氏炉领导工作的谈阿六商量，决定：在贝氏炉需要修补时，先要通知化铁炉职工停止熔炼。除需留作化铁准备工作的工人外，其余的人帮助贝氏炉工人拌沙泥、修补炉子。这样，既缩短了修炉时间，又避免了铁水的浪费。
    电炉工人在代理领班庄洪友带头下，三班工人自动开展了劳动竞赛。进料时间由过去每次需三十分钟缩短到十二分钟，冶炼时间由过去八小时出两炉缩短为七小时出两炉。
    职工还想出各种办法保护炉子，使它能多炼几炉钢水。化铁炉的陆顺祺，想办法减少炉内石灰石的成分，铁的渣滓便能很快地流出来，使炉内的耐火材料不易损伤。过去，贝氏炉上的通风眼，每当炼了十五、六炉后就坏了，不能再炼。王阿义在的时候，工人曾屡次想热补风眼，但始终没有成功。这次，在谈阿六领导下，工人把火泥从炉顶抛入，冒着炉内射出的高温，把火泥逐渐摇移到风眼处，热补成功，使本来不能再炼的炉子，继续吹炼下去。因此，贝氏炉的生产大大提高了。过去炉龄经常只有十五、六炉，最高只有二十二炉，有时只炼了五、六炉，炉子就坏了。最近，工人连续三次创造了每次炼二十三炉的新纪录，比过去的最高纪录还要高一炉。四月二日，贝氏炉又创造了吹炼二十四炉的最新纪录。目前，贝氏炉和化铁炉职工又进行了新的改革，把原有的人力从两班改为三班，炼钢次数也由每星期两次增加到三次。工人们说：“王阿义调走后，我们从心底里感到轻松和愉快，做起活来得心应手，特别轻快。”贝氏炉三月份计划任务比一月份增加了五十吨，结果完成了百分之一百零七点九。假如不是两次停工待料的话，工人一定已经百分之百地实现了保证，补足了一、二月份生产的缺额了。电炉三月份也完成了生产计划的百分之一百四十九点一。（白流源）
