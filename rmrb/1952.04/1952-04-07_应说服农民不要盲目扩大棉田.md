    Should Persuade Farmers Not to Blindly Expand Cotton Fields
    Editor: In the past two years, the cotton planting area in Tong County has gradually expanded. This year, the county and district leading organs mobilized the masses not to further expand the cotton fields, but to focus on increasing the yield per unit area of cotton. However, there are still some people who blindly expand the cotton fields. For example, Gao Delin from Xianninghou Village in the Third District planted three mu of cotton last year, and plans to plant five mu this year; Li Zhongyuan from Guojiachang Village in the Seventh District planted four mu of cotton last year, and plans to plant eight mu this year; Zhang Qi planted five mu last year, and plans to plant ten mu this year; Guojiachang Village has a total of 1,500 mu of land, and more than 300 mu were planted with cotton last year; According to farmers' preparations, it is very likely that 400 to 500 mu will be planted this year. Now it is very close to the cotton sowing season. I suggest that the Tong County People's Government should quickly check the phenomenon of cotton farmers blindly expanding cotton fields, and explain this year's production policy to the farmers to take care of the overall interests of the country.

    应说服农民不要盲目扩大棉田
    编辑同志：两年来通县种棉面积已逐渐扩大。今年县区领导机关曾动员群众不要再扩大棉田，应该注意提高棉花的单位面积产量，但仍有一部分群众盲目扩大棉田。如三区咸宁候村高德林，去年种三亩棉，今年计划种五亩；七区郭家场村李仲元去年种棉四亩，今年计划种八亩；张祺去年种五亩，今年计划种十亩；郭家场村一共有一千五百亩地，去年种三百多亩棉花；根据农民准备情况，今年很可能种到四五百亩。现在离棉花播种时期已很近了，我建议通县人民政府应迅速检查棉农盲目扩大棉田的现象，并向农民解释今年的生产政策，以照顾国家的整体利益。王继尧
