    As the Weather Warms Up, Precautions Should Be Taken to Prevent Grain Spoilage
    Now is springtime, and as the weather warms up, grain is very susceptible to spoilage. More than 600 jin of soybeans stored by the Nancun team of the Pingdu County Grain Company in Shandong Province at the Malan Cooperative were damp, and more than 100 jin became moldy and deteriorated. More than half of the 8,000 jin of millet stored there were also damp. The Pingdu Grain Company also experienced dampness and mold in grain stored at the Huibu, Liaolan, Dianzi, Gaowangshan, and Zhanggezhuang cooperatives. It is likely that this phenomenon is not unique to Pingdu County. It is hoped that grain management departments in various regions will learn from the lesson of the Pingdu County Grain Company, conduct inspections as early as possible, turn over and dry the grain, and avoid unnecessary losses to state property.
                                                                                                          Sun Yigong

    天气渐暖，应防止存粮霉坏
    现值春季，天气渐暖，粮食很易霉坏、山东省平度县粮食支公司南村组存放在麻兰合作社的大豆，就有六百多斤受潮，一百多斤发霉变质；存放在该处的八千多斤谷子，也潮湿过半。平度粮食支公司存在灰埠、蓼兰、店子、高望山、张格庄等合作社的粮食，也发生了潮湿、霉烂等现象。这种现象，想来不只在平度一县发生，希望各地粮食管理部门，接受平度县粮食支公司这一教训，及早进行检查，倒仓翻晒，免使国家资财遭受到不应有的损失。         孙翼功
