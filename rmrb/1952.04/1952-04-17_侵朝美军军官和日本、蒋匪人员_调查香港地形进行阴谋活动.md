Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Paris: According to TASS, the Action Weekly published an article entitled "Martial Law in Hong Kong," stating that American Army and Navy officers have recently arrived in Hong Kong from Japan and Korea. According to the American consulate, they had stayed in Korea for a long time and came to Hong Kong specifically for "recuperation" with the permission of their headquarters. However, the behavior of these American guests is not without suspicion. They are conducting topographical surveys and studying the terrain of areas where the British intend to build airports and barracks. Among them are Japanese military experts and Kuomintang personnel who are very familiar with the areas adjacent to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.

Foreign observers who are closely watching the activities of these military personnel say that their purpose in staying in Hong Kong is to study Hong Kong from the point of view of turning it into an American bridgehead "in case of war."

    侵朝美军军官和日本、蒋匪人员
    调查香港地形进行阴谋活动
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：行动周报发表一篇题为“香港施行的戒严法”的文章称：美国陆海军军官最近都从日本和朝鲜来到了香港。据美国领事馆说：他们是在朝鲜逗留了一段长时期之后，经过他们司令部的许可，特地到香港来“休养”的。但是，这些美国客人的行为却令人不无怀疑之处。他们进行地形调查，并且研究英国打算建筑飞机场和兵营的那些地区的地形。他们中间有日本军事专家和国民党人员，这些人非常熟悉中华人民共和国和香港毗邻的这些地区。
    密切注意着这些军事人员活动的外国观察家说：他们留在香港的目的是从将香港变成美国“在作战时”的桥头堡的观点上来研究香港。
