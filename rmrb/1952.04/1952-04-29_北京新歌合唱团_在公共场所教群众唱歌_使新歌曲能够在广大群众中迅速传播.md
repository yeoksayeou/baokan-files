    Beijing New Song Chorus Teaches the Masses to Sing in Public Places, Enabling New Songs to Spread Rapidly Among the Broad Masses
    
    To the Editor: On Sunday afternoon, April 20th, the Beijing New Song Chorus taught the masses to sing at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. In just over an hour, they taught three to four hundred people to sing "Eliminate Germ Warfare" (lyrics by Guo Moruo, music by Lü Ji). Everyone felt this method was very good and hoped it would be done regularly in the future. Some people even enthusiastically copied down the song, preparing to teach it to others when they returned home.

    I believe this practice of the New Song Chorus is worth promoting. They teach many people to sing, enabling new songs to spread rapidly among the broad masses. I suggest that relevant departments in Beijing and other regions pay attention to this work, and in coordination with the current political movements, organize and mobilize singing groups throughout the city to teach songs promoting the political movements to the broad masses in various public places. I believe that this will surely achieve great results. The literary and artistic circles of Shenyang organized one hundred and ten singing teams during the "Five-Anti" movement, directly teaching 300,000 people to sing "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" songs, which is a very good example.

    北京新歌合唱团在公共场所教群众唱歌
    使新歌曲能够在广大群众中迅速传播
    编辑同志：北京新歌合唱团四月二十日（星期日）下午在北京劳动人民文化宫教群众唱歌，在一个多钟头内，就教会三四百人唱“消灭细菌战” （郭沫若词、吕骥曲）一歌。大家都觉得这个办法很好，希望今后经常这样作。有人并热情地把歌抄下来，准备回去教别人。
    我认为新歌合唱团这种作法是值得推广的。他们教会许多人唱歌，使新歌曲能够在广大群众中迅速传播。我建议北京及各地有关部门，重视这个工作，配合当前政治运动，组织动员全市歌咏团体，到各处公共场所向广大群众教唱推动政治运动的歌曲。我相信，这样一定会做出很大成绩的。沈阳市文艺界在“五反”运动中组织一百一十个歌咏队，直接教会三十万人唱“三反”“五反”歌曲，就是很好的例子。    张守铭
