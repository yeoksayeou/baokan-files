    Boldly Promote Cadres

    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements in various government organs and enterprises, some cadres have been suspended or dismissed. These organs and enterprises are now striving to restore and establish normal operations. The most urgent problem to be solved is the cadre issue. We must boldly and extensively promote activists from the “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” movements to become cadres in various fields. For those who are particularly outstanding and have potential for development, we should break with convention and promote them beyond their current level. In this way, we can quickly improve national institutions, strengthen economic work, and strive to launch a new upsurge of large-scale economic construction across the country after the end of the “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” movements.

    Facts in various places have proven that in those leading organs that have boldly promoted cadres during the “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” movements, economic and business work has not suffered and has even shown new vitality. In other places, although there are verbal calls for establishing routine economic and business work, the failure to actually solve the cadre issue has resulted in many institutions existing in name only, unable to carry out routine work. This inevitably has a serious impact on restoring economic work and revitalizing people's economic lives.

    Why is it not possible to quickly and decisively solve the cadre issue? The fundamental reason is that some leading cadres do not believe in the power of the masses and therefore adopt a conservative attitude of not daring to let go. This erroneous attitude is the main obstacle to promoting cadres and must be quickly overcome.

    Some people only see that certain institutions have been smashed and emphasize the difficulty of cleaning up the "mess," mistakenly believing that future work will be difficult. This is a right-leaning ideology. In the "Three-Anti" movement, we eliminated corrupt elements, which inevitably meant disrupting some "establishments." This is a reasonable and inevitable phenomenon. These "establishments," despite outwardly bearing the sign of state organs, were in fact already rotten, and some had even become fortresses for the bourgeoisie to launch a frenzied attack on the state. Although corrupt elements pretended to be revolutionary cadres on the surface, how could they have been serving the people in the slightest? In the great revolutionary struggle of the "Three-Anti" movement, we must cut off poisonous sores and rotten flesh, cutting off as much as is rotten, without the slightest hesitation. Rotten muscle must be cut away so that fresh muscle can grow. The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau promoted 316 activists who emerged during the "Three-Anti" movement to positions such as foreman, technician, director, stationmaster, and section chief. This not only filled the vacancies caused by the suspension and dismissal of corrupt elements, but also ensured the overfulfillment of production tasks. This fact can sweep away the right-leaning thinking of some leading cadres and shatter the shameless arguments of some corrupt elements who rely on "good business skills, strong abilities, seniority, and indispensable work." We must fully appreciate the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement, resolutely rely on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and boldly promote a large number of activists who have emerged during the movement, who have upright conduct, clean hands, and close ties with the masses. We must rely on them to do the work well.

    Some people outwardly acknowledge the importance of promoting cadres, but in practice they are afraid to give free rein to the newly promoted activists, expressing doubts about their ability to handle the work. They emphasize "seniority," believing that newly promoted people lack "seniority" and therefore cannot be trusted. Of course, the history of revolutionary struggle is valuable, but we must never oppose the basic conditions of virtue and talent to the concept of cadre seniority, thinking that as long as one has "seniority," one has everything. It is wrong and conservative to use "seniority" as the sole criterion for measuring cadres. Some of the corrupt and degenerate elements also had "seniority," but this was just a fig leaf for corruption and degeneration. These corrupt and degenerate elements had long lost their basic revolutionary qualities in the face of the bourgeois offensive. We must not have the slightest nostalgia for their "seniority." Leading workers should be clearly aware that the activists with both virtue and talent who have emerged in large numbers during the "Three-Anti" movement are the basic source of our cadres. Of course, newly promoted cadres will have some unfamiliarity when they start working, but this is not to be feared. Leaders should help them patiently and in a timely manner, encourage them, support them, promote their strengths of connecting with the masses and working with enthusiasm, and boldly use them. They should also establish direct connections with the masses through these activists and establish a regular system for leaders to connect with the masses. This is an important guarantee for doing good work in the future.

    Some comrades believe that promoting new cadres in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements is "a distant solution to an immediate problem," and they only hope that higher authorities can dispatch a large number of skilled cadres. This is an unrealistic idea. The main way to solve the cadre problem in various places should be to rely on the activists who have grown up in the movement in their own localities or departments. Cadres sent by higher authorities can only account for a very small number. In some places, it is even completely impossible. We must not sit idly by and watch the work suffer in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In places where work is urgently needed and there are many cadre vacancies, we must quickly promote a group of cadres from among the activists in a revolutionary spirit and send them to various positions to persist in their work. As long as they should be promoted, they should be boldly promoted. The faster this is done, the less the work will suffer.

    Some people say: Worker cadres do not understand technology and lack culture, and they are afraid that they will mess up the work. This is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Of course, our promotion of cadres is not blind. The cadres who are promoted should generally be able to handle the work and have potential for development. Now, the main problem is that some leading cadres have a purely technical viewpoint and a purely cultural viewpoint when it comes to the cadre issue. They overemphasize the technical and cultural conditions of cadres. In the past, they did not rely on the activists among the masses for a long time in their work, but unilaterally relied on retained personnel and certain unremolded technicians and intellectuals. Facts have proved that these people cannot be relied upon until they are thoroughly remolded. The activists who have emerged in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements are people who have been tested in struggle. They are generally firm in their stance, responsible in their work, have close ties with the masses, and are directly combined with production. Therefore, they will quickly learn to master technology and cultural knowledge in their new positions. Leading cadres should be determined to help the newly promoted activists solve the difficulties in their work. Recently, Shenyang and other places have opened various training classes to help new cadres summarize experience, impart basic knowledge, and boldly let them learn in actual work. These methods are necessary.

    The "Three-Anti" movement has proved that many of our institutions are unnecessary or do not need to be established separately. There are also many institutions where there are more staff than necessary. Now, while solving the cadre problem, we should vigorously streamline institutions and thoroughly correct all phenomena of overstaffing. We must resolutely break the unreasonable phenomena in past organization and systems: Institutions that can be cancelled should be resolutely cancelled, and institutions that can be merged should be resolutely merged. Institutions that have been smashed in the "Three-Anti" movement and are now not necessary to re-establish should not be re-established; all institutions that are not very needed for the time being should be resolutely cancelled, and large institutions should be greatly reduced. Streamlining institutions allows us to more smoothly solve the problem of cadre vacancies and concentrate cadres on the most important work positions.

    Leading organs at all levels should focus on and make good arrangements for the work of promoting and adjusting cadres in a prioritized and step-by-step manner, based on the urgency and importance of work needs. We must resolutely oppose all conservative and departmentalist thinking on the cadre issue and encourage all localities and departments to boldly promote activists in the movement. At the same time, we must strengthen the training and education of activists in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. We must educate the activists who have emerged in the movement on the guiding ideology of the working class, summarize the experience of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, draw a clear line between the bourgeois and proletarian ideologies, and establish a working style based on the mass line. This is of decisive significance for cultivating new cadres.

### 大胆放手提拔干部

    大胆放手提拔干部
    在各机关、各企业反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，有些干部被停职或受到撤职处分，这些机关、企业现在正努力恢复和建立正常的业务工作，当前急需解决的问题，是干部问题。我们必须大胆地，大量地提拔“三反”和“五反”运动中的积极分子，使之成为各方面工作的干部，对其中特别优秀的、有培养前途的，则应当打破惯例，越级提拔。这样，我们就能够迅速地健全国家机构，加强经济工作，争取在“三反”和“五反”运动结束后，在全国范围内迅速展开大规模的经济建设的新高潮。
    各地事实证明，领导机关凡是在“三反”和“五反”运动中大胆提拔干部的，这些地方经济工作和业务工作就没有受到损失，并且已经出现新的气象。另外有些地方，虽然在口头上喊着建立日常经济、业务工作，但因没有实际地解决干部问题，结果，许多机构空有其名，不能进行日常工作，这对于恢复经济工作，活跃人民经济生活就不能不产生严重的影响。
    为什么不能迅速放手解决干部问题呢？基本原因是由于某些领导干部不相信群众力量，因而采取了不敢放手的保守主义的态度。这种错误态度是提拔干部的主要障碍，必须迅速地加以克服。
    有人只看到某些机构被打烂了，便强调收拾“摊子”的困难，错误地以为今后的工作不好作了。这是一种右倾思想。在“三反”运动中，我们清除了贪污分子，也就必然要打乱一些“摊子”，这是合理的必然的现象。这些“摊子”过去尽管在表面上挂着国家机关的招牌，实际上却是早已腐烂了的，其中有的已经完全成为资产阶级向国家举行猖狂进攻的堡垒。贪污分子们过去尽管表面上也装作革命干部模样，但是，他们何尝有半点是给人民作事的呢？在“三反”的伟大革命斗争中，我们必须割掉毒疮烂肉，烂掉多少就割掉多少，不能有丝毫犹豫。腐烂的肌肉割掉了，新鲜的肌肉才能生长起来。天津铁路分局在“三反”运动中提拔了在运动中涌现的三百一十六名积极分子为工长、技术员、主任、站长和股长，不仅补充了某些部门因贪污分子被停职、撤职的缺额，并且保证了超额完成生产任务。这个事实可以扫除某些领导干部的右倾思想；也可以粉碎某些贪污分子自恃“业务好，能力强，资格老，工作少不了我”的无耻论调。我们必须足够地估计“三反”运动的伟大成果，坚决依靠群众的革命积极性，大胆提拔在运动中涌现出来的作风正派、手面干净并同群众有密切联系的大批积极分子，依靠他们来把工作作好。
    有些人表面上承认了提拔干部的重要性，但实际上却不敢放手使用被提拔的积极分子，他们对新提拔的干部能否胜任工作表示怀疑。他们强调“资历”，以为新提拔的人没有“资历”，因而不敢信任。当然，革命的斗争历史是可贵的，但我们绝不能把干部资历同德和才这个基本条件对立起来，以为只要有了“资历”，便有了一切，单纯用“资历”作为衡量干部的标准是错误的保守的观点。贪污蜕化分子中的某些人也曾有“资历”，但这只是一张贪污蜕化的遮羞布。这些贪污蜕化分子，在资产阶级进攻面前，早已丧失了起码的革命品质，对于他们的“资历”，我们决不能有丝毫留恋。领导工作者应当清醒地认识到，在“三反”运动中大批地涌现出来的德才兼备的积极分子，才是我们干部的基本来源。当然，新提拔的干部在开始工作时会有某种不熟练现象，这是不足为惧的。领导上要及时地耐心地帮助他们，鼓励他们，支持他们，发扬他们联系群众、热情工作的长处，大胆地使用他们、并且应当通过这些积极分子建立同群众的直接的联系，制订领导与群众联系的经常制度。这是今后搞好工作的重要保证。
    有的同志认为“三反”“五反”运动中提拔新干部是“远水解不了近渴”，他们只希望上级能够派遣大批熟练的干部。这是不切合实际的想法。各地解决干部问题主要的应当依靠本地或本部门在运动中生长起来的积极分子，由上级机关派来的干部只能占极少数。有的地方甚至完全不可能。我们在“三反”和“五反”运动中绝不能坐视工作受到损失，凡是工作迫切需要而干部缺额多的地方，必须以革命精神迅速从积极分子中提拔一批干部，放他们到各种岗位上去坚持工作。只要是应该提拔的就要大胆提拔，这样做的越快，工作越少受损失。
    有人说：工人干部不懂技术，缺少文化，怕他们搞坏了工作。这是因噎废食的想法。当然，我们提拔干部不是盲目的。被提拔的干部一般都应当是大体上能胜任工作并且有着培养前途的。现在，主要的问题还是某些领导干部在对待干部问题上有着单纯的技术观点和单纯的文化观点。他们过分地强调了干部的技术条件和文化条件，他们过去在工作中长期没有依靠群众中的积极分子，而是片面地依靠了留用人员和某些未经改造的技术人员和知识分子。事实证明，这些人在没有彻底被改造以前，是靠不住的。“三反”和“五反”运动中涌现出来的积极分子则是经过斗争考验的人。他们一般地是立场坚定，工作负责，同群众有着密切联系，同生产直接结合的，因此，在新的岗位上他们会很快学会掌握技术和文化知识。领导干部应当下定决心帮助新提拔的积极分子解决工作上的困难。最近，沈阳等地都开办了各种训练班，帮助新干部总结经验，授以基本知识，并大胆放手让他们到实际工作中去学习，这些办法都是必要的。
    “三反”运动证明，我们有很多机构是不必要的或是不必单独设立的。另有许多机构是人浮于事的。现在应当趁着解决干部问题的同时，厉行精简机构，彻底纠正一切人浮于事的现象。坚决打破过去组织、制度上的不合理的现象：可以取消的机构应当坚决取消，可以合并的机构应当坚决合并。在“三反”运动中已经被打烂而现在没有必要重新建立的机构不应该再建立；凡属暂时不甚需要的机构，应坚决予以取消，庞大的机构应大大加以紧缩。精简了机构，更使我们可以顺利地去解决干部缺额问题，把干部集中使用到最重要的工作岗位上去。
    各级领导机关应当根据工作需要的轻重缓急，有重点地有步骤地作好提拔和调整干部的工作。要坚决反对在干部问题上的一切保守主义思想和本位主义思想，鼓励各地和各部门在运动中大胆提拔积极分子。同时要加强对“三反”和“五反”运动中积极分子的培养和教育工作，对运动中涌现出来的积极分子要进行工人阶级领导思想的教育，总结“三反”和“五反”斗争的经验，划清资产阶级和无产阶级的思想界限，树立群众路线的工作作风。这对培养新干部有着决定的意义。
