Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Shigeji Yoshida, Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, wrote to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, on April 7th, strongly protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons by American and Japanese reactionaries. Chairman Guo Moruo replied on April 17th, hoping to mobilize the Japanese people to stop bacteriological warfare. The correspondence is as follows:

Shigeji Yoshida's Letter to Chairman Guo Moruo of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression:

    I have read the letter you sent to Chairman Joliot-Curie through the World Peace Council, protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons.

    The Japanese people, who have suffered the tragedy of mass murder by atomic bombs, sincerely oppose the use of equally inhumane bacteriological weapons. Especially Japan, which is only separated from Korea by a sea, cannot stand idly by when there is an epidemic in Korea. Kobe, the seaport with the most frequent traffic with Korea, has a large number of dysentery cases even though it is not an epidemic season; and Japanese laborers in Shibaura, Tokyo, who handle military clothing sent back from Korea, are being forced to receive vaccinations. It can be said that bacteriological warfare has become a problem for the Japanese people themselves. What our Japanese people cannot ignore is that during the Second World War, Japanese militarists not only researched and manufactured bacteriological weapons, using Chinese and Soviet people as experimental subjects for murder, but also actually used these weapons in the war of aggression against China. This was clarified during the Khabarovsk war crimes trials. One of the leaders, Lieutenant General Ishii, and other bacteriological war criminals, continue to operate secretly under the protection of reactionary forces, despite the Soviet government's request for extradition. On March 20th, Communist Party member Hyakuro Hayashi questioned the Minister of State Okazaki at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives: "What measures is the government preparing to take against bacteriological war criminals such as former Lieutenant General Ishii?" Minister of State Okazaki replied: "We do not consider former Lieutenant General Ishii, etc., to be war criminals." It is very clear that Japanese militarists are assisting in bacteriological warfare and using Japan as a base for bacteriological warfare. We cannot help but feel sincerely angry about this.

    We Japanese workers firmly protest against the use of bacteriological weapons and fully agree with your proposal to ban bacteriological weapons and punish their leaders. At the same time, we will fight to the end for the immediate realization of a ceasefire in Korea, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

    Shigeji Yoshida, Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions
                        April 7, 1952

Guo Moruo's Reply to Mr. Shigeji Yoshida:

    Your letter of April 7th has been received. You have likely received the "Appeal to All Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" from the Oslo Conference. For the sake of human dignity, I hope to mobilize the Japanese people to put pressure on the leaders and collaborators of bacteriological warfare, to stop the use of bacteriological weapons, and to make them ratify and abide by the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

                        Guo Moruo
                            April 17th

    全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治
    致函郭沫若声援对美国进行细菌战的抗议
    郭沫若复函希望发动日本人民制止美国细菌战
    【新华社十八日讯】全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治四月七日写信给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席，坚决抗议美、日反动派使用细菌武器；郭沫若主席四月十七日复函，希望发动日本人民制止细菌战。来往信件如下：
    吉田资治来信中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席：
    接读了由世界和平理事会送来的你给约里奥—居里主席的反对使用细菌武器的抗议书。
    遭受过用原子弹大量虐杀的悲剧的日本人民，衷心反对同样非人道的细菌武器的使用。尤其是与朝鲜仅一海之隔的日本，对于在朝鲜有疫病流行，决不能袖手旁观。目前与朝鲜交通最频繁的海港神户，虽非疫病流行时期，却已有大量的痢疾发生；而处理由朝鲜送回的军用衣料的东京芝浦的日本劳动者，也被强制受防疫注射，可以说细菌战已经成为日本人民自身的问题。还有为我们日本人民所不能忽视的是：在第二次大战中，日本军国主义者不仅研究、制造了细菌武器，以中国人和苏联人为实验品而加以虐杀，而且在侵华战争中更确实使用过这种武器，这是在伯力审判战争罪犯时已经判明了的。其主持者之一石井军医中将及其他细菌战犯们，尽管苏联政府要求引渡，而在反动势力的庇护下，仍然秘密地在继续活动。三月二十日在众议院外务委员会上，共产党议员林百郎质问：“政府对于细菌战犯石井等准备作如何处置？”国务相冈崎回答说：“对于前中将石井等，我们并不认为是战犯。”这是很明白的，日本军国主义者在协助细菌战，并以日本作为细菌战的基地。对此，我们不能不感到衷心的愤怒。
    我们日本工人坚决抗议使用细菌武器，并完全同意你们的主张，要求禁止细菌武器，并惩罚其主持者。同时，我们要为即时实现朝鲜停战、自朝鲜撤退外国军队和保卫亚洲与世界的和平而奋斗到底。
    全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治
                一九五二年四月七日
    郭沫若复函吉田资治先生：
    四月七日信悉。奥斯陆会议“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，想已接到。为了人类的尊严，望发动日本人民对细菌战的主持者和协助者加以压力，制止细菌武器的使用，使其批准并遵守一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
                      郭沫若
                          四月十七日
