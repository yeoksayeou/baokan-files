    Former Head of Jiangxi Provincial Cooperative Goods Station
    Self-Criticism for Randomly Appointing Unscrupulous Merchants
    To the Editor: The opinions and criticisms raised by Comrade He Suyi of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 10 are entirely correct.

    Since the beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we have discovered some bourgeois spies in our cooperative departments. These bourgeois spies who infiltrated our ranks have caused serious losses to the cooperative economy. Now, I will make a preliminary self-criticism on this issue as follows:

    In the past, I lacked sufficient understanding of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on us and held serious right-leaning ideas. I once thought that the merchants we employed were different from ordinary big bosses, but I failed to recognize that they were sent in by the bourgeoisie. I mistakenly believed that it was merely an employer-employee relationship and that since political power was in our hands, they wouldn't do much. This right-leaning ideology created opportunities for bourgeois elements who were "sent in" to exploit.

    Given the lack of cadres and the urgent need to develop our business, I also lacked sufficient awareness of the seriousness of the personnel approval system. Ideologically, I always believed that the personnel appointments in the enterprise sector could be more lenient, so I did not conduct strict reviews; and I thought that "some of those introduced by the Labor Bureau are also impure, so individual introductions are better." Because I had this kind of thinking, I privately appointed some people, which was very wrong.

    Because I was eager to complete tasks, I also held a "talent-based" view in my thinking, believing that these people could still do some work, and as long as the business developed, ideological problems could be gradually transformed. This shows that my personal political level is not high, and I lack the necessary vigilance against hidden bourgeois spies, resulting in losses to the property of the state and the people.

    The occurrence of the above errors is not accidental. This is the result of my being influenced by bourgeois ideology. In this movement, I will further examine my ideological style and improve my work.

    Editor's Note: This self-criticism is extremely superficial. For example, on the issue of privately appointing unscrupulous merchants, there has been no serious self-criticism of one's own mistakes, but only an attempt to gloss over the matter, downplaying the seriousness of the issue. This is wrong and should be followed by a deeper examination.

### 前江西省合作货栈负责人  对随意任用奸商的检讨

    前江西省合作货栈负责人
    对随意任用奸商的检讨
    编辑同志：三月十日人民日报“读者来信”栏内，发表了江西省人民政府劳动局何愫义同志对我们提的意见与批评，这完全是正确的。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，在我们合作部门，发现了一些资产阶级的坐探。这些混进来的资产阶级的坐探，曾造成合作经济严重的损失。现在我就这个问题，初步检讨如下：
    过去，我对资产阶级向我们的猖狂进攻认识不足，有严重的右倾思想。我曾认为我们所雇用的商人与一般大老板不同，但没有认识到他们就是资产阶级派进来的。我错误地认为这仅仅是个雇佣关系，政权在我们手里，他们不会怎样的。这种右倾思想就给资产阶级“派进来”的分子造成钻空子的机会。
    在缺乏干部而业务又急待开展的情况下，我对人事批准制度的严肃性认识也不够，思想上总认为企业部门任用人员可以从宽些，因此没有严格审查；并认为“劳动局介绍来的也有不纯的，倒不如个别介绍”。由于我有这种思想，就私自任用了一些人，这是非常不对的。
    我因为急于完成任务，思想上还有一种“人才观点”，认为这些人还能做一些工作，只要把业务开展起来，思想问题是可以逐渐改造的。这说明我个人政治水平不高，对暗藏的资产阶级的坐探，缺乏应有的警惕，致使国家人民财产遭受损失。
    以上错误的产生，不是偶然的，这是我受了资产阶级思想影响的结果，在这次运动中，我将再进一步检查自己的思想作风，改进工作。
                              前江西省合作货栈负责人　石天禄
    编者按：这个检讨是极不深刻的。如在私自任用奸商这个问题上就没有认真地检讨自己的错误，只是避重就轻，轻描淡写了事。这是不对的，应继续作深刻的检查。
