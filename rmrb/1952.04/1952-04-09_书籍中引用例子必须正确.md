Letter Summary:

    Examples Quoted in Books Must Be Correct

    In the sixth chapter, forty-seventh section of the second volume of "Chinese Grammar Theory," published by the Commercial Press in September 1951 (third edition) (page 337, line 5 of the original book), a very absurd example was given when discussing abbreviation methods:

    ...For example, "Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" is abbreviated as "Central Committee Member" (中委).

    I think this is an inexcusable and careless attitude. The Commercial Press should conduct a serious review.

    书籍中引用例子必须正确
    商务印书馆一九五一年九月三版的中国语法理论下册第六章第四十七节（原书三三七面第五行），讲到简称法时，举了一个非常荒唐的例子：
    ……例如“中国共产党中央党部执行委员”简称“中委”。
    我以为这是不可原谅的草率态度。商务印书馆应认真检讨。
