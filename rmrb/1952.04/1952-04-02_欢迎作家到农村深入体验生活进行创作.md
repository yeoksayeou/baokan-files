Letter Summary

    Welcome Writers to Rural Areas for In-depth Experience and Creation
    Recently, the news about literary and art workers going deep into factories, rural areas, and military units has been published in the newspaper. After reading it, I felt extremely happy. I work in the rural areas doing government work and often encounter many touching things. For example, last spring, in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, Zhao Haishan, a farmer from Gounihe Village in the suburbs of Beijing, traveled back and forth between urban and rural areas several times to track down a counter-revolutionary element and assisted the police station in arresting the counter-revolutionary element. In the movement to donate weapons to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, Shen Zhen (poor peasant background), a farmer in the village, unhesitatingly pledged 300,000 yuan at one time and committed to paying it off within April. In addition, there are many vivid examples in the movement to implement the Marriage Law.
    If these gratifying new people and new things are grasped by literary and art workers, they will surely become the most valuable creative material.                         Yuan Yueyun

    欢迎作家到农村深入体验生活进行创作
    最近报上登载了文艺工作者深入工厂、农村和部队工作的消息，我读了以后，感到无比的高兴。我在农村做政权工作，经常遇见许多令人感动的事情。例如：去年春天，在镇压反革命运动中，北京郊区沟泥河村农民赵海山为追踪一个反革命分子，往返城乡数次，协助派出所逮捕了反革命分子。在抗美援朝捐献武器运动中，该村农民沈珍（贫农成分）毫不犹豫地一次认捐三十万元，定四月内交清。此外，在贯彻婚姻法运动中，也有不少生动的事例。
    这些可喜的新人新事，如果掌握在文艺工作者的手中，一定可以成为最珍贵的创作素材。                         袁岳云
