To the Editor:

The Li You'an mutual aid team in Tushan Village and farmer Chen Yechen in Lieshang Village, both in Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui, are recipients of this year's high-yield rice model awards. When cadres brought the news of their high-yield model awards to these two villages, the masses in the villages were immediately thrilled. The farmers in Tushan Village were repairing dikes at the time, and they increased their efforts in digging and carrying soil after hearing this good news. They said, "To increase the yield per unit area, we must improve water conservancy." Encouraged by the excellent achievements of the high-yield models, the farmers in this village have increased their confidence in increasing production. All sixty-nine mutual aid teams in the village decided to designate one hundred mu of land as this year's high-yield experimental fields and launch mutual competitions. Everyone set a goal of striving for a yield of 1,000 to 1,300 jin of rice per mu. Encouraged by the high-yield model Chen Yechen, who won the award this time, the farmers in Lieshang Village also launched a patriotic high-yield competition with full confidence, willing to work as hard as Chen Yechen to increase the yield per unit area.

Now the mutual aid teams and farmers in these two villages share a common expectation: to produce well, strive to become high-yield models, and meet Chairman Mao.

    皖南宣城土山埒上两村农民
    学习丰产模范展开生产竞赛
    编辑同志：皖南宣城县土山村的李有安互助组和埒上村农民陈业臣，都是这次受奖的水稻丰产模范。当干部把他们得到丰产模范奖的消息带到这两村以后，这两个村庄的群众立刻沸腾起来。土山村的农民当时正在兴修圩堤，他们听到这一喜讯后，挖土和挑土的劲头都加大了。他们说：“为了提高单位面积产量，就要把水利修好。”这个村的农民在丰产模范优越成绩的鼓舞下，增产的信心提高了。全村六十九个互助组，决定以一百亩田作为今年的丰产实验田，互相展开竞赛。大家确定以每亩产稻一千斤到一千三百斤为奋斗目标。埒上村的农民在这次获奖的丰产模范陈业臣鼓舞下，也满怀信心地展开了爱国丰产竞赛，愿意和陈业臣一样，为提高单位面积产量而奋斗。
    现在这两个村的互助组和农民，有一个共同的期望：好好生产，争取当个丰产模范，去见毛主席。
