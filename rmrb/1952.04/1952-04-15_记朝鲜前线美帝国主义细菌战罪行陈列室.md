    A "Exhibition of Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" was set up at a symposium on the crimes of bacteriological warfare by U.S. imperialism, held on April 3rd at a certain place on the Korean front. On display here are 934 pieces of evidence of the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare, collected from various places on the Korean front and in the rear, as well as more than 200 photographs, and several charts and brochures. These physical evidences are only a small part of the thousands of pieces of evidence of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare in Korea; but even this small part of the evidence is enough to illustrate the crimes of the U.S. aggressors' large-scale use of bacteriological weapons in Korea.

    On rows of wooden shelves are displayed numerous bottles containing various insects carrying germs, viruses, or killing crops, which were spread by U.S. imperialism in Korea, most of which are flies, mosquitoes, and spiders. One small bottle contains flies that were scattered by U.S. aircraft on the snow near Jingu, 30 kilometers northwest of Tieyuan, on February 17th of this year. Another bottle contains flies that flew out of a bacteriological bomb fired by the U.S. military onto our army's position. A photograph hanging on the adjacent wall shows the scene at the time: an unexploded bacteriological bomb is slanted into the snow, and flies flying out of the hole at the tail of the bomb are scattered around the bomb. Entomologist He Qi, who visited here, said: "These types of flies belong to the Muscidae family. In Korea, which is in a temperate-cold zone, they only begin to appear in large numbers after April. Now, in the cold month of February, these flies suddenly appear in large numbers on the snow. It is obvious that they have been artificially cultivated to enhance their cold resistance. Judging from this alone, there can be no other explanation except to prove that U.S. imperialism is conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea."

    The exhibition hall also displays various containers, large and small, used by U.S. imperialism to spread insects. There are cylindrical copper wire mesh cages, 10 centimeters long and 5.9 centimeters in diameter, for containing insects such as fleas, automatically opening light metal chimney-shaped containers about 1 meter high, and exploded green chemically manufactured shell fragments used to launch insects. The U.S. aggressors also used a container divided into four grids and made of iron sheets, with a total length of 1.35 meters, to drop insects. This type of container was previously used to drop butterfly bombs or scatter leaflets. When the enemy used it to spread bacterial insects, although they racked their brains and marked the outside of the container with the words "empty container," this was clearly a trick of "hiding silver three hundred taels here." Many volunteers personally saw piles of flies crawling or flying out of this container.

    The poisons dropped by the U.S. aggressors on display include dead rats, crows, small fish, pork, leaves, etc., all carrying various poisonous bacteria. They attempted to spread plague with dead rats and attract flies with fishy fish to spread the germs on the fish. As for the poisonous cigarettes, canned goods, chewing gum, toothpaste, and other items dropped by U.S. aircraft, they further exposed the despicable and shameless nature of the enemy.

    The final part of the exhibition hall is the result of the analysis by the experts of the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team on the poisonous insects and poisons spread by the U.S. aggressors. All the sinister tricks of the U.S. imperialists were revealed under the microscopes and in the test tubes of the experts. Under the microscope, one could see the plague bacillus tested from the dead rats dropped by U.S. aircraft. The test tube contained typhoid bacillus, cholera vibrio, and various bacteria and viruses tested from various poisonous insects and poisons scattered by U.S. aircraft. Professor Wei Xi, a bacteriology expert who personally tested these bacteria, said: "These pathogenic bacteria that were tested are more virulent than ordinary pathogenic bacteria; it is obvious that this is because the U.S. bacterial war criminals cultivated them artificially to have such strong virulence."

    记朝鲜前线美帝国主义细菌战罪行陈列室
    新华社记者　王玉章　曾思明
    四月三日在朝鲜前线某地举行的美帝国主义细菌战罪行座谈会上，附设一个美帝国主义细菌战罪行陈列室。在这里，陈列着由朝鲜前线和后方各地搜集来的美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证九百三十四件，还有二百多张照片，以及若干幅图表和说明书。这些物证仅是美帝国主义在朝鲜进行细菌战的千万件罪证中的一小部分；但只是这一小部分罪证，就已足以说明美国侵略者在朝鲜大规模地使用细菌武器的罪行。
    在一列列的木架上，陈列着许许多多的瓶子，瓶内盛着美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布的各种带有病菌、病毒或杀害农作物的昆虫，其中以蝇、蚊、蜘蛛为最多。有一个小瓶里的蝇子，是在今年二月十七日美国飞机撒布在铁原西北三十公里的金谷附近雪地上的。有一个瓶里的蝇子，是从美军打到我军阵地上的细菌炮弹里飞出来的。旁边墙上挂着的照片展示着当时的情形：一颗没有爆炸的细菌炮弹，斜插在雪地上，从弹体尾部的窟窿里飞出的蝇子，散在炮弹的周围。在这儿参观的昆虫学家何琦说：“这类蝇子是属于花蝇科，在处于温寒带的朝鲜，要到四月以后才能开始大量出现。现在在寒冷的二月间，突然在雪地上大量出现这些蝇子，很显然是经过了人工的培养，使它的耐寒力增强了。仅从这一点来看，除了证明美帝国主义在朝鲜进行细菌战外，不可能有其他的解释。”
    陈列室还陈列着的美帝国主义撒布昆虫所用的大大小小、各式各样的容器。有容纳跳蚤等昆虫的长十公分、直径五点九公分的圆筒状的铜丝细网笼，有自动开盖的约一公尺高的轻金属烟筒形容器，有发射昆虫用的爆炸了的绿色化学造的炮弹片。美国侵略者还把一种内分四格，由铁片装成的全长一公尺三十五公分的容器，用来投撒昆虫。这种容器过去曾用作投掷蝴蝶炸弹或撒布传单的。当敌人利用它来撒布细菌昆虫时，虽然他们挖空心思，在容器外面标着“空器”字样，但这明明是“此地无银三百两”的把戏，志愿军中有许多人就曾亲眼看见成堆的蝇子从这种容器里爬出或飞出来。
    美国侵略者投下的毒物，陈列有带有各种毒菌的死老鼠、乌鸦、小鱼、猪肉、树叶等等。他们企图用死鼠来传播鼠疫，用腥鱼来吸引苍蝇，把鱼身上的病菌散布开去。至于美国飞机投下的有毒的香烟、罐头、口香糖、牙膏等物品，更加暴露了敌人的卑劣和无耻的面目。
    陈列室的最后一部分是抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队的专家们对美国侵略者撒布的毒虫毒物化验的结果。美帝国主义者的一切毒辣伎俩，都在专家们的显微镜下化验管中原形毕露了。从显微镜里，可以看见从美国飞机投下的死鼠中化验出的鼠疫杆菌。那个化验管里盛装的是从美国飞机撒下的各种毒虫毒物中化验出的伤寒杆菌、霍乱弧菌及各种细菌和病毒。亲手化验这些细菌的细菌学专家魏曦教授说：“化验出的这些致病菌，都比一般的致病菌毒性强；很显然，这是美国细菌战犯们用人工培养以后才有这样强烈的毒性的。”
