Songjiang Zhang Ruiji Bricklaying Team Improves Bricklaying Jointing Method, Advancing Su Changyou's Advanced Experience a Big Step Forward

    The Zhang Ruiji bricklaying team of the Mudanjiang construction area of the Songjiang Provincial Department of Industry's Engineering Office has improved the jointing method in the new bricklaying method, advancing Su Changyou's advanced experience a big step forward. Their bricklaying efficiency reached 2,590 bricks per worker per day in early December of last year, an increase of three to four times compared to the time before the application of Su Changyou's new bricklaying method, and 36 percent higher than the bricklaying efficiency of Su Changyou's team. Zhang Ruiji himself even set a record of laying 4,000 bricks in one day.

    Su Changyou's team's three-stage continuous bricklaying method had many improvements in labor organization and operation methods, but it still followed the staggered jointing method of laying one layer horizontally and one layer vertically, which was common in the Northeast. This method of construction is complex, preventing further improvement in bricklaying efficiency. The six-layer jointing method used by the Zhang Ruiji team lays five layers horizontally before laying one layer vertically. Using this method to build the outer skin of the wall, the area of one horizontally laid brick is equal to the area of two vertically laid bricks, so the wall building speed is faster.

    The six-layer jointing method is relatively simple, enabling a small number of skilled workers to lead many assistants and apprentices, which can save a large number of skilled workers; it also saves materials due to the reduction of bricks used for the outer skin. In addition, because the six-layer jointing method has fewer brick joints than the staggered jointing method, it reduces the gaps for moisture and frost erosion, which can extend the life of buildings. Although the connection strength inside the wall is slightly weaker when using this jointing method, the horizontal connection strength of the wall surface is greater, which can compensate for this shortcoming. In order to better ensure the quality of the project, the Zhang Ruiji team also learned from the experience of the Soviet advanced worker Malichev and changed the laying method of the filling bricks inside the wall to a staggered jointing style to strengthen the internal connection strength.

    The advanced experience of the Zhang Ruiji team has been initially summarized by the Songjiang Provincial Department of Industry, and the Songjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions is preparing to vigorously promote it in the near future.

    Editor's note: The six-layer jointing method is one of the most common jointing methods in the Soviet Union and is generally suitable for ordinary buildings. In the past, China also had jointing methods of laying three or four layers horizontally and then one layer vertically, but their adoption was not widespread. (Xinhua News Agency)

    松江张瑞吉瓦工小组改进砌砖押缝法
    把苏长有的先进经验向前推进了一大步
    松江省工业厅工程处牡丹江工区张瑞吉瓦工小组改进了新砌砖法中的押缝法，把苏长有的先进经验向前推进了一大步。他们的砌砖效率在去年十二月上旬达到每工每天砌砖二千五百九十块，比过去没有应用苏长有新砌砖法时提高三倍到四倍，比苏长有小组的砌砖效率高百分之三十六。张瑞吉本人更创造了一天砌砖四千块的最高纪录。
    苏长有小组的三段连续砌砖法在劳动组织和操作方法上有许多改进，但仍旧沿用着东北通行的横砌一层竖砌一层的连锁押缝法。这种砌法施工复杂，使砌砖效率得不到进一步提高。张瑞吉小组用的六层押缝法，是横砌五层才竖砌一层。用这种方法砌墙的外皮，一块横砌砖等于两块竖砌砖的面积，所以砌墙速度就快。
    六层押缝法比较简单，能使很少的技术工人带领很多的助手和徒工工作，可以节省大批的技术工人；在材料上也由于砌外皮砖减少而有所节省。另外，由于六层押缝法比连锁押缝法的砖缝少，所以减少了湿气和风霜侵蚀的空隙，能增长建筑物的寿命。虽然用这种押缝法时，墙内部的连接力量稍差，但墙面的横的连结力量却较大，所以能补足这一缺点。张瑞吉小组为了更好地保证工程质量，他们又学习了苏联先进工人马里切夫的经验，把墙内填线砖的砌法改为连锁押缝式的，以加强内部的连结力量。
    张瑞吉小组的先进经验，已由松江省工业厅作了初步总结，松江省总工会准备在最近加以大力推广。
    按：六层押缝法是苏联最通用的一种押缝法，一般普通的建筑物都可以适用。我国过去也有横砌三层或四层再竖砌一层的押缝法，但采用不普遍。    （新华社）
