Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 17th: The regular meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers opened in Vienna on the 16th. More than 40 legal professionals from 17 countries including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, the United Kingdom, France, Colombia, and Brazil attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Pritt (UK), Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. Ritter, a famous Austrian jurist, extended congratulations to the meeting on behalf of the Austrian legal professionals and wished the meeting success.

In his speech, Pritt emphasized that the meeting must discuss the following important issues: the investigation report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team on the atrocities of the US military in Korea and the facts of US use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, the issue of a German peace treaty and its interpretation based on international facts, the measures of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers against racism and persecution of colonial and semi-colonial peoples, and other issues.

Pritt said: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, which voluntarily went to Korea to investigate the facts of the US conducting bacteriological warfare, had to work under very difficult conditions and was bombed by US planes many times. The investigation team has collected a large amount of material confirming that the US armed forces are using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

Pritt continued: We must study these materials and pass appropriate resolutions because democratic legal professionals have a responsibility to defend the cause of peace and save the lives of millions of people.

At the meeting, Nordmann (France), Secretary-General of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, briefly reported on the work of the Secretariat of the Democratic Lawyers Association.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 17th: The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to discuss the second item on the agenda - "The Investigation Report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team on the War Crimes Committed by the US Military in Korea and the Facts of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons in Korea and China." Brandweiner (Austria), the head of the investigation team, made a report on this agenda item.

In his report, Brandweiner first said: The investigation team established by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers visited many provinces, cities, and towns in Korea. Wherever the investigation team went, it received full support and assistance from the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In the course of the investigation, the members of the investigation team paid special attention to the facts that proved the US military was conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea.

Brandweiner said: The investigation team has submitted two reports on this issue. However, the bacteriological warfare waged by the United States against the Korean and Chinese people is only a part of its countless crimes. It has also committed many acts that violate international law and most blatantly trample on universally recognized humanitarian principles and conventions of war. For example, the investigation team confirmed the fact that the Americans used chemical weapons in Korea. Another part of the US military's war crimes in Korea is the large-scale massacre of civilians and refugees. In Sinchon alone, more than 35,000 civilians were massacred during the US occupation, including more than 16,000 women.

Brandweiner also presented many other facts illustrating the inhumane acts of the US military against peaceful residents in the occupied areas of Korea. He pointed out that all members of the investigation team unanimously believed that these atrocities were not isolated incidents and were intended to systematically eliminate peaceful residents in the occupied areas.

Brandweiner cited numerous facts illustrating the barbarous bombing of peaceful towns in Korea by US aircraft, which destroyed countless homes, schools, hospitals, and buildings of historical and cultural significance, and this situation is still continuing.

Brandweiner then spoke about the investigation team's findings on the facts of bacteriological warfare. He pointed out that the members of the investigation team had investigated numerous factual materials and questioned more than 300 witnesses. Based on these investigation results and their own observations, they all unanimously concluded that the US military is conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea, dropping insects carrying bacteria and viruses from airplanes.

Brandweiner concluded by saying: Many of the above-mentioned crimes must have been known and planned by the leaders of the US government and the senior command of the US military, otherwise they would not have been committed. Therefore, the investigation team accuses these people and all officers responsible for these crimes on the battlefield, as well as all soldiers who carry out these orders that violate international law.

After Brandweiner's speech, the investigation team members Gaster (UK), Jascue (France), Wasilkowska (Poland), Cavallari (Italy), Morelense (Belgium), and Ke Bonian (China) spoke in succession. They unanimously confirmed the materials and facts presented by Brandweiner in his report.

The meeting continues its work.

    国际民主法协理事会开幕
    讨论美国进行细菌战罪行
    布兰德魏纳对美国罪行提出控诉
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会例会于十六日在维也纳开幕。到会的有苏、中、波、捷、匈、罗、英、法、哥伦比亚、巴西等十七个国家的法律工作者四十余人。
    会议由国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特（英）主持。奥地利著名法学家里特代表奥地利法律工作者向会议致贺，并祝会议成功。
    普里特在发言中着重指出：这次会议必须讨论下述重要问题——国际民主法协调查团关于美国军队在朝鲜的暴行以及美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器之事实的调查结果报告，对德和约问题及其根据国际事实的解释，国际民主法协反对种族主义及殖民地、半殖民地民族迫害的措施，以及其他问题。
    普里特说：国际民主法协自动派赴朝鲜调查美国进行细菌战事实的调查团，不得不在非常艰苦的情况下进行工作，并且还曾有不少次受到美国飞机的轰炸。调查团已收集到大量材料，证实美国武装部队正在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。
    普里特继续说：我们必须研究这些材料，并通过适当的决定，因为民主法律工作者有责任保卫和平事业，并挽救千千万万人民的生命。
    会上，国际民主法协总书记诺德曼（法）简单地作了关于民主法协秘书处工作的报告。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会在十六日下午继续举行会议，讨论到第二项议程——“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团关于美国军队在朝鲜犯的战争罪行以及在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器事实的调查报告”。调查团团长布兰德魏纳（奥地利）就这项议程作了一个报告。
    布兰德魏纳在报告时首先说：国际民主法律工作者协会成立的调查团，访问了朝鲜的许多道市城镇。调查团无论到什么地方，都得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国当局的全力支持和协助。在调查进程中，调查团团员特别注意那些证明美国军队在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实。
    布兰德魏纳说：调查团已就这个问题提出了两个报告。然而，美国对朝鲜和中国人民进行的细菌战，只不过是它无数罪行中的一部分而已，它还有许多行为破坏了国际法，而且最粗暴地蹂躏了人所共认的人道原则和战争惯例。例如，调查团证实了美国人在朝鲜使用化学武器的事实。美国军队在朝鲜的另外一部分战争罪行就是大规模屠杀平民和难民。仅信川一个地区，在美国占领期间，就有平民三万五千多人被屠杀，其中包括妇女一万六千多人。
    布兰德魏纳并提出了其他许多事实，说明美国军队在朝鲜沦陷地区对和平居民的非人道行为。他指出：调查团全体团员一致认为，这些暴行并不是个别的事件，目的是有计划地消灭沦陷地区的和平居民。
    布兰德魏纳举出无数事实，说明美国飞机对朝鲜和平城镇的野蛮轰炸，无数住宅、学校、医院和有历史与文化意义的建筑因此被毁灭，而且这种情形目前仍在继续中。
    布兰德魏纳接着谈到调查团在细菌战事实方面的调查结果。他指出：调查团团员调查过无数事实材料，询问过三百多证人。他们根据这些调查结果，加上他们亲自的观察，都一致得出结论：美国军队是正在朝鲜进行细菌战，从飞机上投下带有细菌和病毒的昆虫。
    布兰德魏纳最后说：上述的罪行中，有许多一定是美国政府领袖和美军高级统帅部知悉并策划的，否则是不会干得出来的。因此，调查团对这些人和在战场上对这些罪行负责的一切军官以及执行这些违反国际法的命令的一切士兵提出控诉。
    在布兰德魏纳发言之后，调查团团员加斯特尔（英国）、贾斯盖（法国）、华西尔考夫斯卡（波兰）、卡瓦莱里（意大利）、莫伦斯（比利时）和柯柏年
    （中国）相继发言。他们一致证实布兰德魏纳在报告中提出的材料和事实。
    会议继续进行工作。
