    The National Day of the Hungarian People
    By Molnár, Member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Minister of Justice of Hungary
    April 4th is the National Day of the Hungarian People's Republic. On April 4, 1945, the victorious Soviet army drove the remnants of the fascist occupiers out of Hungary and liberated the Hungarian people. On this day, the Hungarian working people grandly celebrate their liberation.
    The Soviet army's liberation of Hungary produced two significant results in the lives of the Hungarian people. First, it ended the occupation of the Hitler fascist bandits and their lackeys, thus ending the plunder and suffering of the war. Second, the victory of the Soviet army overthrew the capitalist system with strong feudal remnants, clearing the way for the Hungarian people to move towards people's democracy and socialism.
    Hungary was originally part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire under the Habsburg dynasty. After the First Imperialist World War, the Habsburg dynasty split. Influenced by the great October Socialist Revolution, the Hungarian working people, under the leadership of the working class, seized state power and established the first proletarian dictatorship. Due to the armed intervention of foreign imperialism and the betrayal of domestic right-wing social democrats, the Hungarian Republic of Councils failed in less than a few months. Subsequently, the counter-revolutionary Horthy fascist government plunged Hungary into the most tragic situation in its national history. At this time, Hungary once again became a vassal state of imperialist countries.
    However, the Hungarian proletariat and peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party, which was forced to go underground, launched a heroic struggle against the counter-revolution. In 1924, Comrade Rákosi returned to Hungary. He had been responsible for leading the struggle to establish the working-class regime during the Republic of Councils period. Afterwards, he went to the Soviet Union and served as a member and secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, engaging in the communist movement in several European countries. After Rákosi returned to Hungary, he immediately reorganized the party ranks. Although he was arrested and sentenced by the fascist counter-revolutionary government, he actively guided the Hungarian people's struggle for freedom until his release in 1940. After his release and arrival in the Soviet Union, he further strengthened his leadership of the Hungarian people's struggle. The Horthy reactionary regime dragged the Hungarian people into the anti-Soviet war of the German fascist bandits. However, the result of this war was that the glorious Soviet army liberated Hungary from the rule of German fascist imperialism and its lackeys, and opened the way for the free development of the Hungarian people.
    After the liberation of Hungary, the country's status changed rapidly. For the first time in many centuries, the Hungarian people became their own masters. For the first time, their progress was not hindered by neighboring countries but helped, and this progress gained new strength thanks to the support of the Soviet people who guaranteed the independence of small countries. The liberation of Hungary opened up all opportunities for the Hungarian people to freely create their lives. As Rákosi once said about the issue of national progress, this progress is a new victory in our country, because only now do the working people truly control their own country; only now does a truly free future appear before them; only now are the doors to economic, political, and cultural progress, which were previously closed, suddenly opened.
    After a resolute struggle against reactionary forces, the Hungarian working people established the second proletarian dictatorship in the form of a people's democracy. The proletariat, having seized state power, has achieved more progress in the country's economy and culture in just a few years than the Hungarian bourgeoisie did in decades. In the seven years since liberation, the Hungarian working class and people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have repeatedly repelled the restoration activities of the defeated exploiting classes, openly supported by American and British imperialists. The Hungarian people have established a new social order in sharp class struggles and have waged persistent struggles to consolidate this new social order. When the working class's political power was consolidated, the conditions for promoting national development were in place.
    After the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy from 1947 to 1949, the various tasks of rebuilding the economy destroyed by the war were largely resolved. In the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, the Hungarian Working People's Party, which proposed the plan, together with the Hungarian people, has been and is victoriously laying the foundations for socialism, and is transforming a country that was previously backward and largely agricultural into an industrial and progressive agricultural country.
    The liberation of us by the Soviet Union is the starting point for our achievements and progress. In every step we take forward, it is the Soviet Union that enables us to overcome difficulties. We could not have taken full advantage of the opportunities given to us by the Soviet Union if we did not have a party like the Hungarian Communist Party. This further explains the tremendous progress Hungary has made since its liberation. The Party and its leader, Comrade Rákosi, correctly applied the lessons of Marxism-Leninism to the Hungarian situation, even in the most complex situations.
    The liberated Hungarian people fully understand that the Soviet Union and the powerful peace camp it leads make a decisive contribution to us, safeguarding our national independence, opposing the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and helping us build a new, happy, and socialist country in peace. It is on the basis of this understanding that the Hungarian people actively participate in the struggle to defend peace. It is also the powerful peace movement that provides a safe guarantee for the Hungarian working people on the production front.
    The Hungarian people have a militant friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries in the peace camp, as well as with the working people in capitalist countries who are resisting exploitation and opposing imperialism. Hungary and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are linked by political, economic, and cultural agreements. These agreements are based on the sincere desire of the people of all countries, who are advancing along the road of socialist development for peace. They form the basis of cooperation, and these agreements are also a decisive contribution to the progress of democratic countries and the strengthening of their common struggle to defend peace. These agreements are also a new type of international relations between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which promote mutual progress and consolidate the international peace camp through mutual understanding between the people of all countries.
    The Hungarian working people have participated in various struggles of the international peace camp, and especially at home, they have increasingly heightened their vigilance and military strength. American imperialism and its lackeys are constantly carrying out provocations today. On the southern border of our country, the Tito fascist group in Belgrade, under the direction of its American masters, is waiting for an opportunity to move, attempting to insidiously attack the happy lives of our people. They create border conflicts day after day, send spies to carry out sabotage activities, and attempt to undermine our socialist construction work. But the Hungarian working people stand unswervingly on the front line of defending peace, and gloriously and with increasing enthusiasm victoriously carry out socialist construction, thwarting various imperialist conspiracies.
    The Hungarian people celebrate their liberation day—April 4th—with enthusiastic labor and increased production. In factories and rural areas, in offices and schools, in artists' studios, and in all kinds of production jobs, people have put forward guarantees to celebrate National Day. This patriotic action of millions of liberated Hungarian working people expresses their determination to safeguard their freedom, their understanding of the importance of the struggle to defend world peace, and their full realization that all their efforts for their own progress must at the same time consolidate the world peace camp.
    On this year's April 4th, the Hungarian people will further express their loyalty and gratitude to the Soviet Union, their love for the Party and Comrade Rákosi, and their stronger determination to defend world peace.

    匈牙利人民的国庆日
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员  匈牙利司法部长  莫尔那尔
    四月四日是匈牙利人民共和国的国庆日。一九四五年四月四日，胜利前进的苏军从匈牙利驱逐了法西斯占领者的残余，解放了匈牙利人民。在这一天，匈牙利劳动人民盛大庆祝自己获得解放的节日。
    苏军解放匈牙利，在匈牙利人民生活中产生了两个重大的结果。首先是，结束了希特勒法西斯匪徒及其走狗的占领，因而结束了战争的掠夺和痛苦。其次，苏军的胜利，推翻了有浓厚封建遗迹的资本主义制度，为匈牙利人民扫清了走向人民民主和社会主义的道路。
    匈牙利原是哈布斯堡王朝治下奥匈帝国的一部分。第一次帝国主义世界大战后，哈布斯堡王朝分裂，匈牙利劳动人民受到伟大的十月社会主义革命影响，在工人阶级领导下，掌握了国家政权并且建立了第一次无产阶级专政；由于外国帝国主义的武装干涉和国内右翼社会党人的叛逆行为，匈牙利共和国议会成立不到几个月就失败了，此后，反革命集团霍尔梯法西斯政府就将匈牙利陷入民族历史上从未有过的最悲惨的境地。这时匈牙利重新变成了帝国主义国家的附庸。
    然而，匈牙利的无产阶级和农民在被迫转入地下的共产党的领导下，向反革命展开了英勇的斗争。一九二四年，拉科西同志回国。他在共和国议会时期为建立工人阶级政权的斗争中担负过领导的责任；此后，他曾到过苏联并担任共产国际执行委员会委员兼书记，在欧洲的几个国家内从事共产主义运动。拉科西回国后，立即重新整理了党的队伍。虽然他曾为法西斯反革命政府逮捕并被判刑，但一直到一九四○年获释为止，他都在积极地指导着匈牙利人民争取自由的斗争，而在他获释抵达苏联后更加加强了对匈牙利人民斗争的领导工作。霍尔梯反动政权曾将匈牙利人民拖入德国法西斯匪徒的反苏战争中。然而，这一战争的结果却是光荣的苏军从德国法西斯帝国主义及其走狗的统治下解放了匈牙利，并为匈牙利人民的自由发展打开了道路。
    匈牙利解放后，国家的地位迅速地改变了。匈牙利人民在许多世纪以来第一次成为自己的主人，也是第一次他们的进步不是受到邻国的阻碍而是得到帮助，而且由于保障小国独立的苏联人民的支持，这一进步又获得新的力量。匈牙利的解放，在匈牙利人民的面前，打开了自由地创造生活的一切机会。正如拉科西一次谈到关于国家进步的问题时所说的，这一进步是我们国家里一次新的胜利，因为只是现在，劳动人民才真正地掌握了自己的国家；只是现在，一个真正自由的前途才出现在他们的面前；只是现在，那些以前关闭了的走向经济、政治和文化进步的大门才豁然打开。
    对反动势力进行了坚决的斗争后，匈牙利劳动人民建立了人民民主形式的第二次无产阶级专政。掌握了国家政权的无产阶级，在短短的几年中使国家在经济和文化方面的进步超过了匈牙利资产阶级几十年的成绩。自解放迄今的七年来，在共产党领导下的匈牙利工人阶级和人民一起，曾多次地击退了美英帝国主义者公开支持的已被击败的剥削阶级的复辟活动。匈牙利人民在尖锐的阶级斗争中建立了新的社会秩序，并为了巩固这个新的社会秩序而进行了坚持不懈的斗争。当工人阶级的政治权力巩固之后，促进国家发展的条件便具备了。
    一九四七至一九四九年的发展国民经济三年计划胜利完成后，重建为战争所毁坏的经济的各项工作问题即已大致解决。在执行发展国民经济的五年计划过程中，提出计划的匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民一起已经并且正在胜利地打下走向社会主义的基础，并且正在将几年以前还是落后的基本上是农业的国家转变成一个工业的且有进步农业的国家。
    苏联解放我们是我们获得这些成就和进展的起点。在我们向前进展的每一步骤中，都是苏联使我们能够战胜困难。如果我们没有一个像匈牙利共产党的政党的话，我们就不可能充分利用苏联所给我们的机会。这也就是匈牙利人民解放以来获得巨大进展的进一步的说明。党和它的领袖拉科西同志正确地把马克思列宁主义的教训应用到匈牙利的情况中，有时甚至是最复杂的情况中。
    解放了的匈牙利人民完全明白：苏联和她所领导的强大的和平阵营对于我们有着决定性意义的贡献，她维护我们国家独立，反对美帝国主义的侵略野心，并且帮助我们在和平中建立新的幸福的未来的社会主义国家。正是基于这种认识，匈牙利人民活跃地参加了保卫和平的斗争。也正是强大的和平运动为匈牙利劳动人民在提高生产的战线上提供了安全的保障。
    匈牙利人民对于苏联、中华人民共和国以及和平阵营中其他兄弟国家，和正在反抗剥削反对帝国主义的资本主义国家的劳动人民，有着战斗的友谊。匈牙利和苏联以及人民民主国家之间有政治、经济和文化协定的联系。这些协定是基于各国人民的忠诚的愿望，他们正在沿着争取和平的社会主义发展的道路前进，他们组成了合作的基础，这些协定对于民主国家的进展和加强他们共同保卫和平的斗争也是一个有决定意义的贡献。这些协定同时也是苏联和人民民主国家间国际关系的新类型，这种关系促进相互间的进步，并且经过各国人民相互间的了解而巩固了国际和平阵营。
    匈牙利劳动人民参加了国际和平阵营的各种斗争，特别是在国内，他们日益提高了警惕和军事力量。美帝国主义及其走狗，在今天，不断进行挑衅。在我们国家的南部边疆，贝尔格莱德的铁托法西斯集团在其美国主子指使下正待机蠢动，企图奸诈地进攻我们人民的幸福生活。他们日复一日地制造边界冲突，派遣间谍进行怠工活动，企图破坏我们社会主义的建设工作。但是匈牙利劳动人民坚定不移地站在保卫和平战线上，光辉地而且以日增的热情胜利地进行社会主义建设，打击了帝国主义的各种阴谋。
    匈牙利人民以热情的劳动和提高生产来庆祝自己解放的日子——四月四日。在工厂和农村中，在办公室和学校里，在艺术家的画室里以及在各种各样生产工作岗位上的人们，都提出了庆祝国庆日的保证书。千百万获得解放的匈牙利劳动人民这种爱国行动表示他们要决心维护他们的自由，表示他们明白保卫世界和平斗争的重要性，而且表示他们充分认识到，他们为自己的进步所作的一切努力也必同时巩固着世界和平阵营。
    匈牙利人民在今年的四月四日将要更进一步地表示他们对于苏联的忠诚和感激，对党和拉科西同志的热爱，对保卫世界和平斗争的更强的决心。
