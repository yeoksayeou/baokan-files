    An Open Letter to All Christians in the Country
    By Wang Zizhong, member of the American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes Investigation Group, and Preaching Pastor of the North China Christian Congregational Church
  Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:
    After witnessing firsthand the various evidences of American imperialism's germ warfare on the Korean front, I felt as the prophet Jeremiah said, "His word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay." I cannot but denounce the towering crimes of American imperialism! American imperialism barbarously and indiscriminately bombed towns and villages of all sizes in Korea. Hospitals, schools, and churches were all subjected to brutal bombing without exception. Now, American imperialism is spreading insects carrying bacteria and viruses on a large scale in the front and rear of Korea, and is extending its poisonous hands of germ warfare to our Northeast and Qingdao.
    In the Korean battlefield, I personally saw the containers used by American imperialism to spread insects: plastic shells, paper tubes with parachutes, etc. In the front-line laboratory, I personally saw experts analyze plague bacilli, paratyphoid, dysentery, cholera and other germs from dead mice, insects and poisons scattered by American aircraft. I also heard in person in Pyongyang the tragic accusation of Han Zhuyan, the son of Han Xiangguo, a victim resident of Nanmenli, Zhong District, Pyongyang. Han Xiangguo contracted cholera while catching flies scattered by American imperialism on March 5th and died on March 8th, after which his two grandsons also contracted cholera and died one after another. On April 2nd, in a mountain valley in central Korea, I and several friends from the investigation group personally saw stone flies and leaves that had not yet landed, scattered by American aircraft, and the insects and leaves even landed on my friend Professor Wei Xi. Therefore, the crimes of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare are irrefutable, and Acheson has shamelessly declared that "the United Nations has not used and is not using any kind of bacteriological weapons." This is truly a shameless excuse. This fact has educated me and made me further see the essence of American imperialism: American imperialism is the most cunning, the most brutal and the most inhuman.
    Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord, from the facts of this germ warfare by the American aggressors, you can see who is seeking happiness for mankind and who is harming mankind; who is fighting for peace and who is destroying peace. American imperialism's germ warfare is not only an attack on the people of China and Korea, but also an attack on all good people in the world, the safety and justice of mankind! We Christians, for the sake of justice, for the sake of peace, for the sake of the safety of mankind, should rise up to fight against American imperialism and expose the towering crimes of American imperialism to the people of the world. Scientists, doctors, and nurses among Chinese Christians should actively participate in the work of epidemic prevention and inspection on the Korean front. Since the ideological toxins of American imperialism are as poisonous as germs, we Christians in China should also eliminate the ideological toxins left by American imperialism for many years, actively promote the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Christian Church, stand with the broad masses of people, thoroughly defeat the germ warfare and all vicious tricks of American imperialism, and build our beloved motherland.

### 致全国基督教徒的一封公开信

    致全国基督教徒的一封公开信
    美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团团员华北基督教公理会布道牧师  王梓仲
  亲爱的主内的兄弟姊妹们：
    我在朝鲜前线亲眼看到美帝国主义进行细菌战的种种罪证以后，正如先知耶利米所说：“我心里觉得有烧着的火，闭塞在我骨中，我就含忍不住。”我不能不控诉美帝国主义的滔天罪行！美帝国主义野蛮地滥炸朝鲜人民的大小城镇和村庄，无论是医院、学校、教堂，都毫无例外地遭到残暴的轰炸。现在美帝国主义又在朝鲜的前线和后方大量地散布带有细菌与病毒的昆虫，并且把进行细菌战的毒手伸张到我国东北和青岛等地来了。
    在朝鲜战地，我曾亲眼看见美帝国主义散布昆虫的容器：塑胶炮弹，带降落伞的纸筒等。在前方化验室中，我又亲眼看见专家们从美机撒下的死鼠、昆虫和毒物中化验出的鼠疫杆菌、副伤寒、痢疾、霍乱等病菌。我又在平壤亲耳听见平壤市中区南门里被害居民韩相国的儿子韩洙演的悲愤控诉。韩相国在三月五日捕捉美帝国主义所散布的苍蝇时，得了霍乱，在三月八日死去，以后他的两个孙子也患霍乱而相继死亡。四月二日，在朝鲜中部的某一个山沟里，我和调查团的几个朋友还亲眼看见美机撒布的尚未落地的石蝇和树叶子，虫子和树叶子还落在我的朋友魏曦教授身上。因之美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行是铁证如山，不容抵赖的，但艾奇逊竟信口雌黄地声明：“联合国未曾使用过，也未曾使用着任何种类的细菌武器。”这真是无耻的狡赖。这种事实教育了我，使我进一步看出美帝国主义的本质：美帝国主义是最狡猾的，又是最残暴的最无人性的。
    亲爱的主内的兄弟姊妹们，你们从这次美国侵略者进行细菌战的事实中，可以看出来谁在为人类谋幸福，谁在为害人类；谁是在为和平而斗争，谁是在破坏和平。美帝国主义进行细菌战不仅是向中朝两国人民进攻，而且是向全世界善良的人民、人类的安全与正义进攻！我们基督教徒为了正义，为了和平，为了人类的安全，应当起来与美帝国主义作斗争，向全世界人民揭露美帝国主义的滔天罪行。中国基督教徒中的科学家、医生、护士们，应当踊跃参加朝鲜前线防疫检验的工作。由于美帝国主义的思想毒素和病菌一样毒，我们全中国的基督徒们还应当肃清美帝国主义多年来所遗留的思想毒素，积极推行基督教会的三自革新运动，和广大人民站在一起，彻底打败美帝国主义的细菌战和一切恶毒伎俩，建设我们可爱的祖国。
