    [This newspaper dispatch] Workers in the Northeast, Northwest and cities like Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai are enthusiastically launching production and thrift competitions to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day. After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the labor enthusiasm of workers in state-owned and private enterprises in various regions is extremely high in the competition, and good news of production is constantly coming.
    In the Northeast, workers in cities like Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, and Harbin have successively and enthusiastically launched labor competitions to welcome the "May Day" holiday. One of the goals of this competition is to complete the April production plan ahead of schedule. Some factory workers have also proposed to produce one or several more products outside the plan as a gift for "May Day" International Labor Day. In the production competition to welcome "May Day" in state-owned factories in Shenyang, as of the 23rd, thirty-eight production units had completed their April production tasks ahead of schedule. These units have all put forward the next stage of production increase plans as a gift to commemorate "May Day". For example, after a certain machine factory's east branch completed its task eight days ahead of schedule, it proposed a competition goal of increasing production by 33% of the original plan before the end of April. In the competition, all units more deeply mobilized the masses of workers to launch the "find窍门" (qiàomén, roughly "find the knack" or "find the key") movement, and vigorously promoted various advanced experiences. According to the statistics of only twelve units, more than 239 relatively important production technologies have been improved in more than half a month, and many key problems in production have been solved. The competition in various factories in Lushun-Dalian has entered a climax, and good news of completing the plan ahead of schedule and creating new records has been constantly coming. The Liu Zhao advanced group of Dalian Chemical Factory, which first challenged production groups in factories throughout the city, had come up with 52 new methods to improve production as of April 19th, one of which can increase the country's wealth by more than 320 million yuan. In Harbin, since the Tian Yuping and other advanced groups of the No. 2 Garment Factory proposed to state-owned factories in the city in early April to launch a competition to welcome "May Day", as of the 16th, workers in 46 factories in the city had put forward specific competition conditions and participated in the competition. State-owned factories in other small and medium-sized cities in the Northeast have also launched labor competitions to welcome "May Day".
    After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, workers in state-owned and private factories in the Northwest have raised their awareness as never before, and have proposed to create new records as a gift to welcome "May Day" in the competition plan. Workers at the Tongguan Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau guarantee to exceed the axle of 3 million tons per kilometer in April; the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory proposed to vigorously support the production of peasant brothers, and complete 1,000 Liberation-style waterwheels and 10,000 five-inch simplified walking plows one day ahead of schedule in April. The "Red Flag Competition" of the Xi'an Power Plant is centered on safe operation and reduced coal consumption, and guarantees that no liability accidents will occur before "May Day". The automobile repair plant of the Transportation and Sales Company of the Northwest Petroleum Administration has increased its monthly car repair plan from 100 to 130 vehicles since April. The Dihua People's Flour Mill launched a competition to factories throughout the city on April 15th, which was immediately responded to by workers in various factories. Workers in various factories in the Northwest have launched a campaign to find 窍门 in the competition, and new records continue to emerge. The fine yarn output of the Northwest No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has broken the original plan, and the spindle draft has reached a new record of 1.208 pounds. In mid-April, the Xi'an private Dahua Textile Factory exceeded the competition goal, and the spindle draft reached 1.022 pounds. The warp yarn and sizing workers of the factory adopted advanced operation methods such as sectional bobbin replacement and the use of the shaft on the machine cloth and early separation of the yarn, which can save about 140 million yuan worth of cotton yarn and sizing yarn throughout the year. Workers at the Lanzhou People's Machinery Factory have put forward more than 50 rationalization proposals.
    In Beijing, the coke oven production of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has completed 102% of the task, the quality of coke meets the standards, and by-products such as light oil and ammonia have exceeded the original plan. Li Tinglai, a turbine worker in the power plant of the power department of the plant, improved the method of vacuum pump condensate, which reduced coal consumption by 1%, and is expected to save more than 119 million yuan throughout the year. The workers in the coking department are working selflessly to welcome "May Day" and this year's goal of increasing production and saving 25 billion yuan. Workers at the Capital Power Plant have generally improved their class consciousness in the "Three-Anti" movement, and their production enthusiasm has become increasingly high. The task of completing the overhaul of No. 15 furnace, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 35 days, was completed in 24 days. The workers also came up with a way to try burning inferior coal, which reduced the production cost of the entire plant by 8.51% in the first quarter. In the competition to welcome "May Day", the production efficiency of the Beijing Machine General Factory has been continuously improved. In the casting department, making iron dustpans for waterwheels used to take a craftsman and an apprentice to make only about 10 a day; now worker Yin Baotian takes an apprentice and makes 52 a day, increasing the output by four times. After the Chengzi Mine in Mentougou, Jingxi launched the competition, the daily coal output increased from 664 tons to 1,000 tons. In addition, workers from units such as the Beijing Automobile Company Repair Factory, Beijing Garment Factory, Beijing Water Supply Company, Joint State-Private Yili Food Company, and Beijing Post Office have enthusiastically launched labor competitions.
    Since the workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant launched a competition for over-planned production in April, the output and quality have been rapidly improved, and the safety equipment in the workshop has also been significantly improved. In the competition, the workshops of the plant first unified the operation methods of the three shifts day and night in the form of exchanging experience or technical research meetings, and actively promoted advanced work methods, which greatly improved production. After the Martin furnace in the steelmaking department implemented a complete furnace protection system, the daily output has created five new records in a row in the five days from April 14th to 18th, and the highest daily output has increased by 35.33% compared with the past. The Li Wenhai group in the wire drawing workshop of the second branch implemented the assembly line operation method and improved the wire drawing machine die device, and the daily output exceeded the overproduction plan by 50%. The plant also conducted a major safety inspection during the competition, and found more than 500 major problems that need to be solved in safety facilities. Now the plant has organized veteran technicians, engineers, management personnel, etc. to continue to study and improve technology, and timely rectify and improve the safety system. Due to the above improvements, since April, the steel ingot output of the plant has exceeded the overproduction plan, and in terms of quality, the first-class product of steel ingots has increased by more than 15%. Since the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory launched the competition, new achievements have been continuously emerging in production. The skin roller flower in the fine yarn workshop has quickly dropped from 70 pounds per shift to 33 and a half pounds, and the doffing time has also dropped from 48 seconds to 36 seconds. Huang Jucai, a labor model in the weaving workshop, has increased his daily weaving to 39.5 yards. All the workers of the factory also guarantee to overproduce 1,000 bolts of cotton cloth and 10 pieces of cotton yarn in addition to completing the April production increase and thrift plan.
    In Shanghai, workers in some state-owned, joint state-private factories and some private factories that have thoroughly carried out the "Three-Anti" struggle, and some private factories that have undergone the "Five-Anti" struggle are welcoming the "May Day" festival with unprecedented high labor enthusiasm. At present, workers in 61 factories (including five private factories) in textiles, steel, machinery, and chemical industries have launched a ten-day or two-week labor competition between workshops and groups. The goal of the competition is to create new records in production, strive to overfulfill the April production plan, and fire the first shot for future regular production competitions. In the labor competition plans set by the factories, workers unanimously proposed to use the achievements of improving quality, reducing waste, and increasing output as gifts for the "May Day" festival. After Lu Agou, an advanced worker at the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, led the workers of the whole group to overfulfill the first quarter's production task by 70%, he proposed a plan to increase the actual production performance of the first quarter by another 50%, and the waste rate is still guaranteed not to exceed one thousandth. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of the originally planned April production increase and thrift plan, workers at the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory decided to increase the production of yarn by another 126 pieces and cloth by 2,917 bolts, and reduce the second-class cloth rate of serge from 5% to 3%. Workers at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Factory also proposed to increase the output by 15% to 20%, improve the quality by 10%, and reduce the cost by 5% on the basis of past production achievements. A large number of worker cadres who were promoted to leadership positions in the "Three-Anti" movement have bravely shouldered the glorious task of leading and organizing labor competitions. Yang Shaochang, an old worker who was newly promoted to deputy director of the Huafeng Iron and Steel Plant, in addition to leading all engineers and technicians to study ways to reduce waste, also called on all workers at the conference to concentrate their efforts to reduce waste in the labor competition. He himself went deep into the leadership of the furnace group to formulate competition methods to ensure that the furnace was operated well. In the labor competition to welcome "May Day", workers in various factories are determined to learn various advanced work methods to improve quality and output. Workers in many factories have also actively improved tools and operating methods.
