    The People of the Motherland Donated Artillery to Defeat American Aircraft
    A Letter from a Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the People of the Motherland
    Dear Comrades of the Motherland: When we hold your letters in our hands here on the Korean front lines, we are as happy as if we were seeing our own relatives. Your kind words encourage our determination to advance victoriously. Thanks to your continuous support, our lives are getting better day by day. In particular, the planes and artillery you donated have completely bankrupted the "air superiority" boasted by the American bandits. When we first entered Korea, the enemy's planes were extremely rampant. Day and night, we could hear the explosions of heavy bombs and the sound of machine gun fire at any time. But since the planes and anti-aircraft guns you donated arrived, this situation has quickly changed, and the enemy planes have been subdued by us!
    On the morning of New Year's Day this year, while we were happily celebrating the New Year, four jet enemy planes and eight P-51 enemy planes flew in to attack the target protected by our anti-aircraft artillery battalion. The gunners immediately entered their positions. As the first jet enemy plane began to dive, our shells exploded in the air. Before the first bomb was dropped by this enemy plane, two shells hit its head and abdomen. It spewed out a plume of black smoke, burned in the air, and quickly crashed into the hillside not far from the position. The remaining enemy planes saw that the situation was not good and wanted to escape. But how could the gunners be willing to let go of the gifts that were delivered to their doorsteps! The muzzles continued to whistle, and the shells bloomed gray flowers in the enemy plane group. Then, a P-51 enemy plane burned and fell in the air. In addition, three enemy planes were hit and injured, dragging thick black smoky tails as they fled. After the battle, loud cheers erupted on the position. One gunner said, "The American devils are having bad luck this year, letting us shoot down two of their planes and wound three on the first day of the New Year." Another gunner said, "Let us take today's harvest as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao and the comrades of the motherland."
    For a long time afterwards, the enemy planes did not dare to come to this area again.
    Dear Comrades of the Motherland! No matter what tricks the American imperialists play, we are fully confident of completely eliminating them! We hope that you will continue to create brilliant victories on all fronts, especially on the fronts of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy!
        A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Yin Guoqing, Miao Shucheng

### 祖国人民捐献的大炮战胜了美国飞机  志愿军某部给祖国人民的回信

    祖国人民捐献的大炮战胜了美国飞机
    志愿军某部给祖国人民的回信
    亲爱的祖国同胞们：当我们在朝鲜前线双手捧读你们的来信的时候，就像看到了自己亲人一样地欢喜。你们的亲切的言词，鼓舞了我们胜利前进的决心。由于你们源源不断地支援，我们的生活现在是一天比一天好了。特别是你们捐献的飞机大炮，使美国强盗所吹嘘的“空中优势”完全破产了。我们刚进入朝鲜的时候，敌人的飞机猖狂极了。我们白天夜晚，随时都可以听到重磅炸弹的爆炸声和机枪扫射声。可是自从你们捐献的飞机和高射炮送来以后，很快就改变了这种情况，敌机被我们制服了！
    今年元旦的早晨，我们正在高兴地过新年的时候，四架喷气式敌机和八架P五十一型敌机飞来，袭击我们这个高射炮营所保护的目标。炮手们立刻进入阵地。当第一架喷气式敌机开始向下俯冲时，我们的炮弹在空中爆炸了。这架敌机第一个炸弹还没有投下，两发炮弹就击中了它的头部和腹部。它喷出一股黑烟，在空中燃烧起来，很快就坠在离阵地不远的半山腰里。其余的敌机见势不妙，想要逃走。但送上门来的礼物，炮手们那能舍得放走呢！炮口不断地发出啸声，炮弹在敌机群里开出了灰色的花朵。接着，有一架P五十一型敌机在空中燃烧下坠了。另外有三架敌机被击伤，拖着浓黑的烟尾巴逃走了。战斗结束后，阵地上发出了响亮的欢呼声。有一个炮手说：“美国鬼子今年走死运，大年初一就让我们把它的飞机揍下来两架，揍伤了三架。”另一个炮手说：“让我们把今天这个收获，作为给毛主席和祖国同胞的新年献礼吧。”
    以后很长一个时期，敌机再也没有敢来这片地方。
    亲爱的祖国同胞们！不管美帝国主义耍什么花样，我们完全有把握彻底消灭它！希望你们努力在各个战线上，尤其是在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的战线上，继续创造辉煌的胜利！
