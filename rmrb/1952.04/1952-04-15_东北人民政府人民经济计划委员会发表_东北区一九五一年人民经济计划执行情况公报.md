The Northeast Region's industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, trade, transportation, and the people's material and cultural life achieved further development and improvement in 1951 under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The main situation is as follows:

(1) Over-fulfillment of State-Owned and Publicly-Operated Industrial Plans and Growth of Industrial Production

In 1951, all workers in the Northeast Region's state-owned and publicly-operated industries over-fulfilled the annual industrial production and financial plans with creative patriotic labor.

The total output value of state-owned and publicly-operated industries exceeded the plan by 12.7 percent, an increase of 24.1 percent over the previous year. Among them, state-owned industries exceeded the plan by 12.7 percent, an increase of 20.6 percent over the previous year. The following seven ministries (bureaus) exceeded the plan: the Ministry of Industry, the Railway System, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, the North China Shipping Administration, and the Postal and Telecommunications Administration. The following three ministries (bureaus) did not fulfill the plan: the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Trade, and the Inland Waterways Administration. The total output value of the Ministry of Industry exceeded the plan by 13.4 percent, an increase of 28 percent over the previous year.

Local publicly-operated industries, whose production was not normal in the past, developed rapidly this year. The total output value exceeded the plan by 12.7 percent, an increase of 47.6 percent over the previous year. Ten provinces (cities), including Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, Benxi, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe, all completed the plan. Only Anshan City did not complete it.

The value of increased production and savings of state-owned and publicly-operated industries throughout the year was equivalent to 16 million tons of grain. Among them, the part exceeding the plan accounted for 36.9 percent; the part of cost reduction accounted for 18.8 percent; and the part of saving circulating funds accounted for 44.3 percent.

The large over-fulfillment of the production and financial plans of state-owned and publicly-operated industries once again proves the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship system, under which the working people can exert infinite power.

The production of private industries has also increased. According to statistics from three major cities, Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian, calculated at fixed prices, the output value of state-commissioned processing increased by 76.5 percent over the previous year. With the increase in the self-made output value of private industries, the total output value of private industries increased by 45.5 percent over the previous year.

In order to meet the needs of the state and the people in production and life, all industries of state-owned and publicly-operated enterprises have increased. Because the consumer goods produced in the Northeast in the past were relatively small, while the peasants' demand for industrial products increased day by day, the growth of consumer goods this year was relatively fast. The following are the main figures for the increase in 1951 compared with 1950:

In terms of means of production, non-ferrous metal mining increased by 83 percent; machinery and its parts increased by 78.4 percent; coke and mineral oil increased by 62.6 percent; iron ore and manganese ore increased by 54.3 percent; electricity increased by 34.1 percent; chemical products increased by 25.3 percent; steel increased by 22.7 percent; non-ferrous metal smelting increased by 20 percent; and coal and oil shale increased by 11.1 percent. The proportion of machinery manufacturing and repair in the total output value of state-owned and publicly-operated industries has increased.

In terms of consumer goods, fur increased by 104.2 percent; clothing increased by 55.6 percent; soap and cosmetics increased by 45 percent; food increased by 37.5 percent; matches increased by 35.3 percent; edible salt increased by 26.2 percent; and textiles increased by 14.7 percent.

In terms of cultural supplies, educational, scientific, and artistic supplies increased by 84.6 percent; paper increased by 33.8 percent.

In terms of building materials, cement increased by 45.1 percent; glass increased by 19 percent.

However, the forest industry failed to meet the needs; logging decreased by 4.5 percent compared with the previous year; and timber production decreased by 12.8 percent.

In total, the total output value of consumer goods in state-owned and publicly-operated industries increased by 29.2 percent over the previous year; the total output value of means of production increased by 22.1 percent. The production of the entire state-owned and publicly-operated industry is still dominated by means of production, accounting for 70.7 percent of the total.

(2) Major Achievements in Industrial Technology

In 1951, state-owned industries, combined with the security inspection, quality inspection, and the increase production and practice economy campaign, strengthened technical management, and launched a wide range of mass movements to promote advanced operating methods and advanced production experience. As a result, universal achievements were made in technology, thus increasing output, improving quality, reducing raw material consumption, and increasing equipment utilization. The greatest technical achievements were made in the iron and steel smelting sector, the power sector, and some light industrial sectors.

Due to the implementation of the furnace top regulation method and the full air volume, high air temperature, and fast material operation method for blast furnaces, an unprecedented advanced new record appeared in the blast furnace utilization coefficient, and the equipment utilization rate for ironmaking increased by 27.3 percent. After using a large amount of sintered ore to make first-class steelmaking iron and establishing a thermal management system, the steelmaking time was greatly shortened, which increased the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces by 28 percent.

The utilization rate of power equipment has also increased; mainly through repairs to increase the output of 56,000 kilowatts and adjusting the load to tap the potential of 30,000 kilowatts.

The rapid cooking method shortens the cooking time of pulp: the production efficiency of wood pulp is increased by 20 percent, and the production efficiency of reed pulp has increased by 74 percent. The increase in copying speed has enabled the papermaking industry to tap 20 percent more equipment capacity.

In addition, the machinery manufacturing sector has been able to manufacture 800-kilowatt hydroelectric generators and high-voltage stator coils for 13,800-volt large generators. The quality of steel has been significantly improved, and the average unqualified rate of chemical composition has been reduced by 88.2 percent compared with the previous year; the rejection rate of heavy rail billets has been reduced by 93 percent compared with the severe months of the previous year, and the qualified rate of machine tools has increased by 39.5 percent compared with the previous year, and the ash content of coal washing has been reduced by 5.4 percent compared with the previous year.

The promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool and multi-blade cutting is a major technical reform in the machinery manufacturing sector; however, issues such as production deployment and labor organization in the machinery industry need to be further resolved.

(3) Continued Development and Improvement of Agricultural Production

In 1951, people's governments at all levels led farmers throughout the region to universally carry out the patriotic bumper harvest movement, focusing on consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation, improving labor efficiency, and improving agricultural technology to increase yield per unit area. In terms of water conservancy and afforestation, long-term construction work was carried out to protect and improve agricultural production and gradually overcome natural disasters.

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production throughout the region has been further developed and improved. Among them, there are a total of 456,109 agricultural three-season mutual aid teams, agricultural and sideline combined long-term and relatively fixed teams, accounting for 49.3 percent of the total number of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Several agricultural production cooperatives have also emerged. These three types include a total of 2,188,645 households, accounting for 32.9 percent of the total number of agricultural households. Therefore, it plays a great role in improving agricultural labor efficiency, improving production technology, rationally using land, developing rural division of labor, and increasing farmers' income.

The state supplied and promoted 173 sets of new-style horse-drawn farm implements, 2,798 various foreign plows, 5,200 shovel weeding machines, 1,486 tons of various insecticides and disinfectants, and various fertilizers, including 17,000 tons of ammonium sulfate and 212,000 tons of soybean cake. The fertilization area of various crops in the region has increased, and the fertilization area of industrial raw material crops has reached 81.4 percent. The work of selecting seeds and promoting improved varieties has also made progress. The area sown with improved varieties in the three crops of soybeans, wheat, and rice has reached 620,000 hectares.

Due to the above measures, in general areas that have not suffered disasters, the yield per unit area has increased, and new records of high yield have been created. The highest yield of seed cotton per hectare has reached 6,620 jin; the highest yield of soybeans per hectare has reached 8,605 jin; the highest yield of wheat per hectare has reached 7,575 jin; the highest yield of sorghum and corn per hectare has reached more than 10,000 jin; and the highest yield of rice per hectare has reached 20,000 jin. The total value of agricultural crop production in the region still completed 98 percent of the plan, an increase of 3.3 percent over the previous year, despite difficult conditions such as spring drought, autumn floods, severe floods, and early winter frost. The region produced 17.09 million tons of grain, completing 95.6 percent of the plan. The output plan for industrial raw materials was 99 percent for cotton; 99.9 percent for sugar beet; over 3.3 percent for flax; over 4.7 percent for flue-cured tobacco; and over 60.4 percent for jute.

In 1951, grain output decreased by 5.2 percent compared with the previous year. One of the main reasons was disasters, which affected a reduction of about 700,000 tons. The second was the expansion of the area of industrial raw material crops, which occupied more than 540,000 hectares of cultivated land. In the future, the planting ratio of grain and industrial raw material crops should be stabilized at the current level, and grain and industrial raw materials should be increased by increasing the yield per unit area.

In terms of afforestation, in 1951, the western shelterbelt had already begun surveying, and 19,601 hectares had been built. This initiative of the People's Government to fundamentally transform natural conditions has begun to be implemented. A total of 114,729 hectares have been afforested in other areas. In order to meet the needs of large-scale afforestation, a total of 268 nurseries have been established and restored in the region, with a total nursery bed area of ​​877 hectares.

Water conservancy construction has shifted from general levee repairs and damming to focusing on fundamental projects, and from restoring irrigation areas to focusing on expanding and newly opening irrigation areas. In terms of water management, in addition to completing various repair projects of 7.22 million cubic meters and more than 100 large and small buildings in the basins of the Hun River, the Taizi River, and the Taoer River, the survey work of the Canwo Reservoir on the Taizi River was carried out, and the embankment repair project of 104.6 kilometers on the left and right banks of the Raoyang River was completed. In the upper reaches of the Raoyang River tributaries, 552 valley barrages were tested. In terms of irrigation, the project of repairing and adding water delivery lines in the north and south areas of the Lishu Irrigation Area in the East Liao River was completed, adding 5,500 hectares of paddy fields; 4,820 hectares of paddy fields were newly opened in the three major irrigation areas of Qian Gorlos Banner, Panshan, and Zha Hanyang, and other irrigation areas, and 22,940 hectares of paddy fields were maintained. The paddy field area in the region has reached more than 310,000 hectares.

Due to protection and breeding, the total number of livestock in the region increased by 6.7 percent compared with the previous year. Among them, horses increased by 5.6 percent; draft cattle increased by 8.9 percent; goats increased by 10.3 percent; and sheep increased by 34.6 percent. There have been increases in pigs, chickens, and livestock products. Farmers in various places have improved the feeding management of livestock, and the work of livestock disease prevention and improved breeding has also been expanded. There are six counties in the region that promote the improvement of breeding stallions, and the number of stallion mating stations has been expanded from 79 to 99.

Fishery exceeded the plan by 6.6 percent; the region caught 160,000 tons of fish.

There are 542 state-owned farms, and the sown area increased by 41.3 percent compared with the previous year, reaching 176,648 hectares, accounting for more than 1 percent of the total sown area in the region. Among them, there are 19 farms where more than 80 percent of the cultivated land is cultivated by machinery, with 65,000 hectares of cultivated land.

(4) Expansion of Commodity Circulation

With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in people's purchasing power, commodity circulation has also expanded. The total amount of commodity circulation of state-owned trade was completed and exceeded the plan, an increase of 70 percent over the previous year. Sales in the Northeast region exceeded the plan by 25.9 percent, an increase of 96.9 percent over the previous year; purchases in the Northeast region exceeded the plan by 1.7 percent, an increase of 64.1 percent over the previous year.

The business scope and operating varieties of state-owned trade have also increased. There has been great progress compared with 1950 in increasing the supply of industrial equipment, actively promoting rural local and sideline products, and expanding the supply of various daily necessities for urban and rural people. Various contract systems have been developed and improved. State-owned trade has also been further combined with local public industries, which has facilitated the large-scale increase in local industrial production and increased the source of material supply. In 1951, the sales of industrial equipment increased by 5.5 times compared with 1950; medicine increased by 1.7 times; department stores increased by 1.4 times; local products increased by 70 percent; petroleum increased by 70 percent; grain increased by 49 percent; coal and building materials increased by 47 percent; and cotton yarn companies increased by 22 percent. The supply of industrial equipment is still weak and needs to be strengthened.

State-owned trade has begun to pay attention to retail business, and the retail sales increased by 71.4 percent over the previous year, but it still cannot meet the needs of urban people and workers in industrial and mining areas; there are only 1,550 state-owned retail stores in all cities in the region, only an increase of 13.8 percent over the previous year. In state-owned trade organizations, conservative hoarding ideas once occurred, and the leading role in curbing private merchants' speculation in winter and market supply throughout the year was not fully exerted.

The cooperative system in the region has expanded the supply of consumer goods and the sales of local and sideline products. In 1951, the retail sales of cooperatives to urban and rural people increased by 66.9 percent compared with the previous year; the sales of local and sideline products increased by 79.5 percent. The number of members increased by 40.5 percent compared with the previous year. Rural members have accounted for 42.7 percent of the rural population; urban members accounted for 24 percent of the urban population. There are 10,947 cooperatives in urban and rural areas throughout the region, which are important organizational forces in material supply and marketing. However, in the retail sales of cooperatives, means of production only accounted for 3.9 percent, and due to the efforts to change in the second half of the year, it only reached about 10 percent by the end of the year. The share capital of cooperatives only increased by 15.5 percent compared with the previous year due to problems in profit distribution and poor absorption.

(5) Development of Transportation

In 1951, railway employees in the entire Northeast, with intense labor, ensured the completion of heavy national defense transportation tasks, and coordinated with the development of production and trade, transporting 22.2 percent more economic materials than the previous year. The railway transportation plan for economic materials was completed by 101.9 percent. The transportation plans for various major materials, except for grain due to the impact of harvest, such as coal, timber, steel, and cement, have been overfulfilled.

Due to the development of the 500-kilometer locomotive movement and learning advanced Soviet operating methods such as shunting and marshaling, the railway's technical indicators have also been overfulfilled. The freight car turnover rate reached 3.24 days, exceeding the plan by 1.5 percent, accelerating by one and a half hours compared with the previous year. The travel speed exceeded the plan by 1.7 percent, increasing by 6.8 percent compared with the previous year. The freight car loading and unloading operation dwell time completed 100 percent of the plan, shortening by 0.6 hours compared with the previous year.

In 1951, three major measures were taken in the railway system: (1) Implementing the method of regional production and sales and rational transportation of materials such as coal, grain, timber, and cement greatly reduced opposite transportation and long-distance transportation, saving a total of 113,000 carloads of transportation capacity throughout the year. (2) Adopting the method of increasing the load of freight cars. From July, more than 335,000 tons of goods were transported within half a year. (3) Compiling direct trains, which is the main reason for shortening transit time; the direct trains throughout the year have reached 21.7 percent of the total number of trains.

In 1951, the inland river freight volume decreased by 3.7 percent compared with the previous year due to the extremely low water level of the rivers. The freight volume of highway transportation increased by 66.1 percent compared with the previous year, and rubber-tired trucks increased by more than doubled.

Postal and telecommunications business plans have been overfulfilled. Mail increased by 31.6 percent compared with the previous year, and domestic telecommunications increased by more than 50 percent.

(6) Expansion and Improvement of Capital Construction

In 1951, the scale of capital construction continued to expand on the basis of 1950. The quality of major projects has been considerably improved, and the actual completed workload has increased by 41.37 percent compared with the previous year. Among the total amount of work completed, the industrial sector accounted for 62 percent; the transportation sector accounted for 16 percent; the agricultural and forestry sector accounted for 7 percent; and the finance and trade sector accounted for 9 percent. Due to many difficulties and shortcomings in design and construction forces, material supply, and human resource organization and allocation, the annual capital construction plan was only completed by 80.87 percent, and the waste and loss in construction and installation projects were more serious.

In the construction industry, especially in the state-owned and publicly-operated industrial construction sector, advanced Soviet experience was adopted, and the enterprise and contracting system was strengthened, which significantly improved work efficiency and project quality compared with the previous year. For example, the efficiency of mechanized coal mine construction increased by 300 percent, the bricklaying project reached 300 percent of the general quota, the assembly line operation of carpentry increased the quota by 200 percent, a large number of various advanced work groups emerged, and winter construction was tested to extend the construction period.

(7) Increase in the Number of Employees and Improvement of Labor Productivity

Due to the development of the national economy, at the end of 1951, the number of employees in various economic sectors in the Northeast increased by 282,000 compared with the end of 1950. Among them, state-owned and publicly-operated industries increased by 128,000; capital construction increased by 55,000; trade, cooperation, and financial sectors increased by 45,000; agricultural and forestry sectors increased by 26,000; and transportation sectors increased by 22,000. Due to the continuous expansion of the employment field, unemployment in the region has been basically eliminated.

In 1951, labor productivity was significantly improved compared with the previous year due to further development of the patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign, promotion of rationalization proposals, improvement of tools and operating methods, promotion of advanced experience of advanced workers, and promotion of piece-rate wages.

Labor productivity in state-owned and publicly-operated industries increased by 14.2 percent; the workload (ton-kilometers) of each employee in the railway system increased by 25.4 percent; and the turnover of each employee in state-owned trade increased by 23.15 percent. In the industrial sector, the Ministry of Industry system increased by 12.8 percent; and local public industries increased by 18.1 percent.

Labor productivity of various major products: pig iron increased by 45.58 percent; cement increased by 40.45 percent; cotton yarn increased by 9.33 percent; steel increased by 6.13 percent; and cotton cloth increased by 3.61 percent.

(8) Development of Culture, Education, and Health

In 1951, the People's Government vigorously carried out the work of training construction talents and developed school education.

Various universities and colleges increased by 79 percent, and the number of students increased by 36 percent compared with the previous year. Among them, the number of students in engineering schools increased by 40 percent.

Secondary schools increased by 20.4 percent, reaching 392 schools; with 266,000 students, an increase of 21 percent. Among them, students in technical schools accounted for 11.6 percent.

Primary schools increased by 5.9 percent, reaching 36,000 schools; with 5.12 million students, an increase of 13 percent.

In this year, famous production models and labor models were admitted to further study, and a large number of worker-peasant cadres entered senior technical schools, specialized schools, and worker-peasant rapid middle schools. There were 8,685 young technical and professional personnel who graduated from universities and colleges and secondary technical schools and took up economic construction jobs.

At the same time, the industrial system also trained 33,215 apprentices in the form of technical schools, factory and mine training classes, and master-apprentice systems. Among them, 15,900 have been promoted to technicians. 500,000 employees in the region participated in various spare-time studies, eliminating illiteracy among 73,000 employees.

In 1951, the distribution of books and newspapers and the film industry developed greatly. The Northeast Daily had an average daily circulation of 216,182 copies, an increase of 36 percent over the previous year. 99 million copies of various books and periodicals were published, an increase of 69 percent over the previous year, and 92 million copies of books and periodicals were distributed. 519 films were distributed, and the average daily audience of movies was 167,000, an increase of 86 percent over the previous year.

There are 15 radio stations, 568 broadcasting stations and receiving stations, and 22,349 listening groups in the region. A total of 468,000 people regularly listen to the radio collectively. Among them, 332 broadcasting stations are located in various factories and mines.

The publicity networks in various places have a total of more than 13,000 reporters and more than 310,000 propagandists.

There are 245 cultural centers in various cities in the region, and 57 cultural stations have been established in rural areas.

Due to the strengthening of cultural and educational undertakings and publicity work, the movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy have been effectively coordinated in the past year, making the people of the region universally receive patriotic education.

In 1951, health care, epidemic prevention, and medical institutions were greatly expanded. There are a total of 3 sanatoriums, 26 hospitals, 42 rest homes, 43 clinics and outpatient departments, 61 maternal and child health stations, 86 health rooms, and 240 health centers in industrial and mining enterprises. In rural areas, there are a total of 989 district health centers, 335 central village health centers and village health stations, 180 maternal and child health stations, 13,990 midwifery stations, and 37,424 reformed old midwives.

The trial operation of spare-time recuperation in industrial and mining areas has allowed 28,000 patients with mild illnesses to be treated in a timely manner, reducing pain and increasing attendance. The development of maternal and child health stations and midwifery stations has greatly reduced the number of infants and puerperal fever deaths due to tetanus in rural and urban areas. The "tissue therapy" was promoted, and medical workers of "tissue therapy" were trained. More than 10,500 cases were treated within half a year, and the effect was very good.

In 1951, in terms of epidemic prevention, the number of people vaccinated accounted for 77 percent of the population of the region; there were only 225 smallpox patients, a decrease of 92 percent compared with the previous year. Cholera did not occur at all.

(9) Improvement of People's Material Life

Due to the development of economic construction, the material life of workers and peasants has also been improved.

In 1951, the basic salary of employees (including production workers, technicians, management personnel, various business personnel, and public education personnel) increased by 15.3 percent compared with 1950. Among them, piece-rate workers, who accounted for 43.5 percent of the total number of production workers, increased their wage income by an average of more than 20 percent due to the implementation of the piece-rate wage system with more pay for more work. In addition, the additional wages for cultural and welfare undertakings for employees paid by the state in proportion to the total wage fund increased by 30 percent compared with the previous year, and the region newly built 703,000 square meters of dormitories for employees.

The lives of farmers have also generally improved, with about 70 percent living the life of middle peasants, and their purchasing power has increased by 37 percent compared with the previous year. The consumption of industrial products by farmers has increased significantly, expanding the sales of industrial products; and they can invest more surplus funds in production.

Due to the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people, state-owned trade sold 28.6 percent more cloth, 52 percent more shirts and trousers, 30 percent more rubber shoes, 1.31 times more scented soap, 1.19 times more soap, 82 percent more sugar, and 88 percent more various types of paper in the Northeast region compared with the previous year. At the same time, there are new requirements for the quality of goods.

The improvement of the people's material and cultural life has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of employees. In addition to completing the national plan tasks, they have also increased production and saved a large amount of wealth for the country; it has encouraged farmers to increase grain and industrial raw materials and create new records of high output; and will enable workers and peasants in the region to greet new economic construction tasks with high labor enthusiasm.

    东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会发表
    东北区一九五一年人民经济计划执行情况公报
    一九五一年，东北区的工农业生产、基本建设、贸易、交通运输与人民物质文化生活，在毛主席与中央人民政府、中共中央的英明领导下获得进一步的发展与提高。主要情况如下：
    （一）国公营工业计划的超额完成与工业生产量的增长
    一九五一年，东北区国公营工业的全体工人以创造性的爱国主义的劳动，超额完成了全年的工业生产，财务计划。
    国公营工业的总产值，超出计划百分之十二点七，比上年度增长百分之二十四点一。其中，国营工业超过计划百分之十二点七，比上年度增长百分之二十点六。超过计划的有：工业部、铁路系统、财政部、农业部、卫生部、北洋海运管理局和邮电管理局等七个部（局）；未完成计划的有林业部、贸易部和内河航运局等三个部（局）。工业部的总产值，超过计划百分之十三点四，比上年度增长百分之二十八。
    地方公营工业过去的生产不够正常，在这一年发展较快，总产值超过计划百分之十二点七，比上年度增长百分之四十七点六。沈阳、旅大、抚顺、本溪、黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽东、辽西、热河等十个省（市）都完成了计划，只鞍山市未完成。
    国公营工业全年增产节约的价值折粮一千六百万吨。其中，生产超过计划部分占百分之三十六点九；降低成本的部分占百分之十八点八；节约流动资金的部分占百分之四十四点三。
    国公营工业生产财务计划的大量超额完成，再一次证明，人民民主专政制度的优越性，在这样的制度之下劳动人民能够发挥无穷无尽的力量。
    私营工业的生产亦有增长，根据沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大三个主要城市，按固定价格计算，由于国家委托加工的产值比上年度增长百分之七十六点五，加上私营工业自制产值的增长，私营工业的总产值比上年度增长了百分之四十五点五。
    为了满足国家与人民在生产上与生活上的需要，国公营工业的各个产业都增长了，并且，由于过去东北生产的消费资料较少，而农民对工业品的需要则日益增加；因此，本年度消费资料的增长相对的较快。下面是一九五一年比一九五零年增长的主要数字：
    在生产资料方面，有色金属采掘增长百分之八十三；机械及其零件，增长百分之七十八点四；焦炭与矿物油，增长百分之六十二点六；铁矿及锰矿，增长百分之五十四点三；电力增长百分之三十四点一；化学制品增长百分之二十五点三；钢铁增长百分之二十二点七；有色金属冶炼增长百分之二十；煤和油母页岩增长百分之十一点一。机械制造与修理，在国公营工业总产值中的比重已经提高。
    在消费资料方面，皮毛增长百分之一○四点二；服装增长百分之五十五点六；肥皂及化妆品，增长百分之四十五；食品增长百分之三十七点五；火柴增长百分之三十五点三；食盐增长百分之二十六点二；纺织品增长百分之十四点七。
    在文化用品方面，教育、科学与艺术用品增长百分之八十四点六；纸张增长百分之三十三点八。
    在建筑材料方面，水泥增长百分之四十五点一；玻璃增长百分之十九。
    但是，森林工业未能满足需要；伐木比上年度减产百分之四点五；制材减产了百分之十二点八。
    总计，国公营工业中消费资料的总产值，比上年度增长百分之二十九点二；生产资料的总产值，增长百分之二十二点一，整个国公营工业的生产则仍以生产资料为主，其比重占到百分之七十点七。
    （二）工业技术上的重大成就
    一九五一年，国营工业，结合保安大检查，质量检查与增产节约运动，加强了技术管理，为推广先进操作方法，先进生产经验，开展了广泛的群众运动，在技术方面普遍获得成就，因此，产量增加，质量有改进，原材料消耗减少，设备运用率提高。技术成就最大的是钢铁冶炼部门、电力部门和某些轻工业部门。
    由于推行高炉的炉顶调剂法和全风量，高风温、快料顺行操作法，高炉利用系数出现了空前先进的新纪录，炼铁的设备运用率提高了百分之二十七点三。在采用大量烧结矿制成一级炼钢用铁，并建立热工管理制度之后，大大地缩短了炼钢的时间，使得平炉的利用系数提高了百分之二十八。
    电力设备运用率亦有提高；主要是经过检修提高出力五万六千瓩，调整负荷发挥潜力三万瓩。
    快速蒸煮法，缩短了纸浆的蒸煮时间：木浆生产的效率因而提高了百分之二十，苇浆的生产效率则已提高百分之七十四，抄速的提高，使造纸工业多发挥了百分之二十的设备能力。
    此外，机器制造部门已能制造八○○瓩的水力发电机和一万三千八百伏特巨型发电机的高压定子线圈。钢的质量显著提高，化学成份不合格率平均比上年度减少百分之八十八点二；重轨胚废品率比上年度严重月份减少了百分之九十三，工作母机的合格率比上年度提高了百分之三十九点五，洗煤的灰分比上年度降低了百分之五点四。
    高速切削法与多刀多刃切削法的推行，是机械制造部门中的重大技术改革；但是，机械工业中的生产布署与劳动组织等问题尚需进一步求得解决。
    （三）农业生产的继续发展与提高
    一九五一年，各级人民政府领导全区农民普遍地开展了爱国丰产运动，着重巩固与提高互助合作，提高劳动效率，改进农业技术，以增加单位面积产量。在水利与造林等方面，进行了保护与提高农业生产，逐渐战胜自然灾害的长远建设工作。
    全区农业生产的互助合作运动，有了进一步的发展与提高。其中，农业三大季互助组、农副业结合长年不散较为定型的组，已共达四五六、一○九个，已占全部互助合作组织总数的百分之四十九点三，并出现了若干农业生产合作社，这三类所包括的农户共达二、一八八、六四五户，已达农业总户数的百分之三十二点九。因之，在提高农业劳动效率，改进生产技术，合理使用土地，发展农村分业分工，增加农民收入上，均有很大作用。
    国家供应与推广的新式农具，有全付马拉农具一七三套，各种洋犁二、七九八台，铲?机五、二○○台，各种杀虫药和消毒剂一、四八六吨，各种肥料，有硫安一万七千吨，豆饼二十一万二千吨，全区各种作物的施肥面积都增加了，工业原料作物的施肥面积，则已达百分之八十一点四。精选种籽、推广优良品种的工作也有进展，在大豆、小麦、水稻三种作物中，用优良品种播种的面积已达六十二万垧。
    由于上述措施，在一般未遭灾害的地区，单位面积产量均有提高，并创造了高额产量的新纪录。籽棉每垧最高产量已达六、六二○斤；大豆每垧最高产量已达八、六○五斤；小麦每垧最高产量已达七、五七五斤；高粱、苞米每垧最高产量已达一万斤以上；水稻每垧最高产量已达二万斤。全区的农作物生产总值，虽在春旱、秋涝、严重水灾与冬季早霜等困难条件之下，仍完成了计划百分之九十八，比上年度增加百分之三点三。全区产粮一、七○九万吨，完成了计划百分之九十五点六。工业原料的产量计划，棉花完成百分之九十九；甜菜完成百分之九十九点九；亚麻超过百分之三点三；烤烟超过百分之四点七；洋麻超过百分之六十点四。
    一九五一年，粮食产量比上年度减少了百分之五点二。主要原因之一是灾害，影响减产约七十万吨，二是工业原料作物面积的扩大，多占用耕地五十四万余垧。今后应使粮食与工业原料作物的种植比例稳定于现在的水平，而从提高单位面积产量上，增产粮食与工业原料。
    造林方面，一九五一年，西部防护林带，已经开始调查，并已营造一九、六○一垧。人民政府从根本上改造自然条件的这一创举，已着手实施。其他各地共造林一一四、七二九垧，为适应大量造林的需要全区共建立与恢复苗圃二六八处，育苗床面积共达八七七垧。
    水利建设，已由一般的复堤堵口转向重点进行治本工程，由恢复灌区转向重点扩大与新开灌区。治水方面，除在浑河、太子河、洮儿河等流域完成各项补修工程七二二万公方和大小建筑物百余座之外，进行了太子河参窝水库的勘测工作，完成了绕阳河左右岸的堤防修补工程一○四点六公里。并在绕阳本支流的上游试筑谷坊五五二座。灌溉方面，完成了东辽河梨树灌区的南北两区整修与增辟送水线路的工程，增开水田五、五○○垧；在前郭旗、盘山、查哈阳三大灌区及其他灌区新开水田四、八二○垧，维持水田二二、九四○垧。全区水田面积已达三十一万余垧。
    由于保护与繁殖，全区牲畜的总数比上年度增加了百分之六点七。其中，马增加百分之五点六；役用牛增加百分之八点九；山羊增加百分之十点三；绵羊增加百分之三十四点六。猪、鸡及畜产品均有增加。各地农民对牲畜的饲养管理有了改进，牲畜防疫与种畜改良工作也扩大了。全区共有种马改良推广县六个，配马站已由七十九处扩充到九十九处。
    渔业超过计划百分之六点六；全区捕鱼十六万吨。
    国营农场已达五四二处，播种面积比上年度增加了百分之四一点三，共达一七六、六四八垧，占全区播种总面积百分之一强。其中百分之八十以上耕地用机械耕种的农场有十九处，耕地六万五千垧。
    （四）商品流转的扩大
    随着工农业生产的发展与人民购买力的提高，商品流转也扩大了。国营贸易的商品流转总额完成并超过了计划，比上年度扩大百分之七十。在东北区内的销售超过计划百分之二十五点九，比上年度扩大了百分之九十六点九；在东北区内采购超过计划百分之一点七，比上年度增加百分之六十四点一。
    国营贸易的业务范围与经营品种也增多了，在增加工业器材的供应，积极推销农村土副产品与扩大城乡人民多种日用品的供应等较一九五○年有了很大进步。各种合同制度有了发展与改进。国营贸易与地方公营工业也有了进一步的结合，便利了地方工业的大量增产，增加物资供应的来源。一九五一年比一九五○年工业器材的销售额增加了五倍半；医药增加了一点七倍；百货增加了一点四倍；土产增加了百分之七十；石油增加了百分之七十；粮食增加了百分之四十九；煤焦及建筑器材增加了百分之四十七；花纱布公司增加了百分之二十二。工业器材的供应工作仍较薄弱，须待加强。
    国营贸易对零售业务已开始注意，零售额比上年度增长了百分之七十一点四，但仍不能适应城市人民及工矿区职工的需要；全区各城市只有一、五五○个国营零售店，只比上年度增加了百分之十三点八。在国营贸易机构中，曾一度发生保守惜售思想，对于制止冬季的私商投机与全年的市场供应上领导作用发挥不足。
    全区合作社系统扩大了消费品的供应和土副产品的销售工作。一九五一年，合作社在城乡人民中的零售额，比上年度增加了百分之六十六点九；土副产品推销额增加了百分之七十九点五。社员比上年度增加了百分之四十点五。农村社员已经占到农村人口百分之四十二点七；城市社员占了城市人口百分之二十四。全区各地城乡共有一○、九四七个社，是物资供销中的重要组织力量。但是在合作社的零售额中，生产资料只占百分之三点九，由于后半年的努力转变，年终才达到百分之十左右的水平。合作社的股金，由于分红上存在问题与吸收不力，只比去年度增加百分之十五点五。
    （五）交通运输事业的发展
    一九五一年，全东北的铁路员工，以紧张的劳动，在保证完成繁重的国防运输任务之下，配合生产与贸易的发展，比上年度多运了百分之二十二点二的经济物资。经济物资的铁路运输计划完成了百分之一百零一点九。各种主要物资，除粮食因收成影响未完成计划外，如煤炭、木材、钢铁、水泥等运输计划都已超额完成。
    由于开展了机车五百公里运动及学习苏联先进的调车编车等操作方法，铁路的各项技术指标也超额完成了。货车运转率达到三点二十四天，超过计划百分之一点五，比上年度加速一个半小时。旅行速度超过计划百分之一点七，比上年度提高百分之六点八。货车装卸作业停留时间完成计划百分之百，比上年度缩短了零点六小时。
    一九五一年，在铁路系统中采取了三项重大措施：（1）实行煤炭、粮食、木材、水泥等物资分区产销合理运输的办法，大大减少了相向运输与远程运输，全年共节省了十一万三千个车皮的运输力。（2）采用货车增载的办法，从七月份开始，半年之内多运货物三十三万五千余吨。（3）编组直达列车，这是缩短中转时间的主要原因；全年直达列车已达列车总数百分之二十一点七。
    一九五一年的内河货运因江河水位特低，比上年减少百分之三点七。公路运输的货运比上年度增加百分之六十六点一，其中胶皮大车增加一倍以上。
    邮电业务计划均已超额完成。邮件比上年度增加百分之三十一点六，国内电讯增加百分之五十以上。
    （六）基本建设工作的扩大与
    改进
    一九五一年基本建设规模在一九五○年的基础上继续扩大，主要工程的质量有了相当改进，实际完成的工作量比上年度增加百分之四十一点三七。在完成的工作总量中，工业部门占百分之六十二；交通运输部门占百分之十六；农林部门占百分之七；财政贸易部门占百分之九。由于设计与施工力量、器材供应、人力组织调配方面存在很多困难与缺点，全年基本建设计划仅完成百分之八十点八七，且在建筑按装工程中，浪费损失情况较为严重。
    在建筑工业中，尤其是国公营工业建筑部门，接受了苏联的先进经验，加强了企业化与包工制，使工作效率，工程质量较上年度均有显著提高，如煤矿机械化建井效率提高百分之三百，砌砖工程达到一般定额的百分之三百，木工流水作业使定额提高百分之二百，涌现出大批的各类先进工作小组，并试行冬季施工，延长了工期。
    （七）职工人数的增加与劳动生产率的提高
    由于国民经济的发展，一九五一年底，东北各经济部门的职工人数，比一九五零年底增加了二十八万二千人。其中，国公营工业增加十二万八千人；基本建设方面增加五万五千人；贸易、合作及金融部门增加四万五千人；农林部门增加二万六千人；交通运输部门增加二万二千人。由于就业面不断扩大，本区内失业现象已基本消灭。
    一九五一年的劳动生产率，由于进一步开展了爱国主义的增产节约运动，推行了合理化建议，改良了工具和操作方法，推广了先进工作者的先进经验，推广了计件工资，比上年度显著的提高了。
    国公营工业的劳动生产率，提高了百分之十四点二；铁路系统每一职工的工作量（吨公里）提高了百分之二十五点四；国营贸易每一职工的营业额提高了百分之二十三点一五。在工业方面，工业部系统提高百分之十二点八；地方公营工业提高百分之十八点一。
    各种主要产品的劳动生产率：生铁提高百分之四十五点五八；水泥提高了百分之四十点四五；棉纱提高百分之九点三三；钢提高百分之六点一三；棉布提高了百分之三点六一。
    （八）文化、教育、卫生事业的发展
    一九五一年，人民政府大力进行了培养建设人材的工作，并发展了学校教育。
    各种高等学校，增加了百分之七十九，学生比上年度增加百分之三十六。其中，工科学校学生增加百分之四十。
    中等学校增加百分之二十点四，达三九二所；学生二十六万六千名，增加百分之二十一。其中，技术学校学生占百分之十一点六。
    初等学校增加百分之五点九，达三万六千所；学生五百十二万人，增加百分之十三。
    在这一年，有著名的生产模范、劳动模范入学深造，大批工农干部进了高中级技术学校、专科学校与工农速成中学。有八、六八五名青年技术及专业人员从高等学校及中级技术学校毕业，走上了经济建设的工作岗位。
    同时，工业系统又以技工学校、厂矿训练班、师傅带徒弟等形式培养了徒工三三、二一五名，其中，有一万五千九百名已被提升为技工。全区有五十万职工参加了各种业余学习，消灭了七万三千个职工文盲。
    一九五一年，书报发行与电影事业的发展很大。东北日报每日平均发行二一六、一八二份，比上年度增加百分之三十六。出版各种书刊九千九百万册，比上年度增加百分之六十九，发行书刊九千二百万册。发行影片五一九部，电影的观众，平均每天有十六万七千人，比上年度增加了百分之八十六。
    全区共有广播电台十五座，广播站及收音站五六八处，收听小组二二、三四九个。经常集体收听广播的共达四十六万八千人。其中有三三二个广播站是设在各厂矿中。
    各地的宣传网共有报告员一万三千余人，宣传员三十一万余人。
    全区各城市有文化馆二四五处，农村已有文化站五十七处。
    由于文化教育事业与宣传工作的加强，一年来有力的配合了抗美援朝、镇压反革命和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，使全区人民普遍受到爱国主义教育。
    一九五一年的保健、防疫与医疗机构，扩充了很多。在工矿企业中共有疗养院三座，医院二十六座，休养所四十二个，诊疗所门诊部四十三个，妇幼保健站六十一个，保健室八十六个，卫生所二四零个。在农村中，共有九八九个区卫生所，三三五个中心村卫生所及村卫生站，一八○个妇幼保健站，一三、九九○个接生站，经改造的旧产婆三七、四二四人。
    工矿中试行业余疗养有二万八千名轻病患者得到及时处理，减少了痛苦并提高了出勤率。妇幼保健站与接生站的发展，使农村与城市因破伤风死亡的婴儿与产褥热大量减少。推行了“组织疗法”、培养了“组织疗法”的医务工作人员，半年之内治疗病例一万零五百余例，效果很好。
    一九五一年，在防疫方面，种痘人数占全区人口百分之七十七；天花患者仅二二五人，比上年度减少了百分之九十二。霍乱则根本未发生。
    （九）人民物质生活的提高
    由于经济建设的发展，工人、农民的物质生活也更加提高。
    一九五一年的职工（包括生产工人、技术人员、管理人员、各种业务人员、公教人员）基本工资比一九五零年提高了百分之十五点三。其中，占生产工人总数百分之四十三点五的计件工人，因为贯彻了多劳多得的计件工资制度，工资的收入则平均提高了百分之二十以上。此外，国家按工资基金总额比例支给职工的文化福利事业的附加工资，比上年度增加百分之三十，全区为职工新建宿舍七十万三千平方公尺。
    农民的生活也普遍得到改善，已有百分之七十左右过着中农的生活，购买力比上年度提高百分之三十七。农民消费的工业品显著增加，扩大了工业品的销路；并能有更多的余资投入生产。
    由于城乡人民生活的改善，国营贸易在东北区内，比上年度多销布匹百分之二八点六；衬衣裤百分之五十二；胶鞋百分之三十；香皂一点三一倍；肥皂一点一九倍；砂糖百分之八十二；各种纸张百分之八十八。同时，在商品质量方面也有了新的要求。
    人民物质文化生活的提高，更加鼓舞了职工的生产积极性，除完成国家计划任务外，又为国家增产节约了大量的财富；鼓舞着农民增产粮食和工业原料，创造了高额产量的新纪录；并将使全区的工人和农民以高度的劳动热忱来迎接新的经济建设任务。一九五二年四月十日
