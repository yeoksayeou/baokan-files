    State-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Mill
    Generator Casing Parts Left on Platform for a Year Without Being Moved
    To the Editor: At the end of 1950, the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Mill, upon order from higher authorities, packed a No. 4 steam turbine generator for transport within twenty days. Our factory workers braved strong winds and heavy snow to complete the task in two weeks. However, these packed parts have been left on the factory platform for over a year now, and have yet to be moved. During this time, considerable money was spent on elevating them for transport and opening the crates to inspect the main components. Although the main crates have been fitted with rain protection, the anti-rust paint on some pipes, especially the condensers and water separators made of welded iron plates, has gradually peeled off. We have repeatedly reported this situation to the leadership, but they have still not been moved. This bureaucratic attitude of not valuing state property should be reviewed.

    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂
    发电机箱件放在月台上一年来未见运走
    编辑同志：一九五○年年底，国营青岛第六棉纺织厂奉上级命令，在二十天内把四号汽轮发电机装箱待运。我厂职工冒着大风大雪在两星期中完成任务。但是，这批箱件却放在我厂月台上，至今一年多了，还未运走。其间为搬运垫高并开箱检查主要机件，曾花了不少钱。主要箱子虽都加了防雨装置，但一些管子，尤其是用铁板烧焊制成的冷凝器和分水器上面的防锈漆皮，已渐脱落了。我们曾屡次向领导方面反映这个情况，但仍不见搬走。这种不重视国家资财的官僚主义态度应加检讨。鲍引年
