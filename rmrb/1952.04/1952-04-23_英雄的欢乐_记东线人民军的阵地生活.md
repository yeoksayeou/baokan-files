Heroic Joy
    ——A Record of the People's Army's Trench Life on the Eastern Front
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter He You
    The eastern front in Korea is a chain of continuous, towering mountains. The mountains are covered with dense forests, and the roads are rugged. Many places remain untouched by humans throughout the year. In spring and autumn, the peaks are shrouded in thick white fog all day long, and in winter, heavy snow falls, accumulating to several feet. Even in April, when sea breezes carrying cold currents blow over the mountains, snowflakes still swirl. On this war front, where mountains are high, forests are dense, valleys are deep, and streams are swift, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army have turned every mountain into an impregnable fortress.
    In early spring, I visited the People's Army soldiers guarding a mountain more than 1,100 meters high. Here, they overcame numerous difficulties and created a joyful trench life. As I entered their position, I saw groups of three or five soldiers sitting at the entrances of their bunkers, singing "The Song of the Scouts." Their voices echoed through the forests and mountains. On the large trees at the bunker entrances, the soldiers hung wall newspapers written on birch bark instead of paper. The wall newspapers featured articles written by the soldiers, such as "The Heroic Deeds of Heavy Machine Gunner Park Kwan-young" and "Kim Seok-bok Shoots Down Two Enemy Planes with a Rifle," praising the deeds of combat models and introducing combat experience. The wall newspapers also displayed many charts and cartoons drawn with red soil, yellow soil, and charcoal. Inside the bunkers, the soldiers had arranged their battlefield homes. Gleaming automatic rifles were neatly arranged on gun racks, and wooden shelves along the walls held many books and magazines. The heated floors were covered with mats woven from bark, and strings of red leaves collected from the high mountains hung from the "ceilings." Soldiers with artistic talent carved mountain stones and various figures from pine bark and branches. Others mixed paste with mud to paint colorful murals on the walls, depicting scenes with strong national characteristics such as "Trench Scenery," "Shooting Practice," "Sunrise at Mount Kumgang," and "Choyang Waterfall." Each of these paintings was infused with the deep love of the Korean soldiers for their beautiful homeland.
    A commander of a People's Army company led me into the soldiers' tall, spacious, and bright "underground club," which could accommodate more than 300 people. The club was equipped with a stage and hung with huge portraits of Generalissimo Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and General Kim Il-sung. The walls were adorned with pictures cut from Soviet pictorials, Chinese People's Pictorial, and Korean pictorials, and glued onto American parachute silk. These pictures made the club very beautiful. Various books, newspapers, and magazines were displayed on many newly made tables, along with playing cards and various chess pieces. After each attack on the enemy or after repelling an enemy offensive, the soldiers would come here to read, play chess, or play cards.
    Every officer and soldier of the People's Army loves to sing and dance and enjoys cultural and recreational activities. Even in the most difficult days of combat, the sounds of gunfire and smoke could not drown out their songs. These songs and dances strongly embodied the fiery fighting spirit of the Korean people. In every company I visited, they had established music groups, dance groups, art groups, and poetry recitation groups. Most of the soldiers and officers participated in these organizations. They held a competition every month, and the works judged to be excellent at the competition were written into wall newspapers, pamphlets, or mimeographed into special collections, which were distributed and circulated. Joint performances were also frequently held in the battlefield "underground theater." Soldiers from various arms of service and companies selected their best actors to perform their own outstanding works here. They brought the arduous battles and the tense but joyful trench life to the stage. The soldiers of a certain unit guarding near "Heartbreak Ridge" performed two plays ridiculing Van Fleet's disastrous defeat on "Heartbreak Ridge." These two plays were called "Hill 1211" and "巧在五点三十分" [Ingenious at 5:30]. Soldiers from another company collectively created a play praising the merits of soldier Heo Seok in battle, entitled "Hero Heo Seok Receives a Letter from Home." The scouts also wrote "Thirty Li Behind Enemy Lines," depicting their own combat life. In their own works, the soldiers portrayed many heroic figures.
    I have repeatedly enjoyed the People's Army soldiers' folk song solos, poetry recitations, and theatrical performances. For example, the songs "A Thousand Times a Hundredfold," "Victory," and "Korean-Chinese Friendship" by the Kim Kyung-chul combat team of a certain unit, which described the powerful peace camp, strongly reflected the People's Army soldiers' belief in their own strength and their determination to win. Their expression of hatred for the enemy and boundless love for the people deeply moved people. As a young People's Army signalman told me, "Now I only have one feeling, which is to hate the enemy; one wish, which is to eliminate the enemy. We are not without difficulties and hardships, but revolutionary optimism and the determination to eliminate the enemy always prevail over them."
    The young People's Army commanders and fighters are fighting resolutely against the enemy with such strong wishes and intense emotions. On the long, cold winter nights, on the snow-covered mountaintops, good news came almost every day. Assault team members, scouts, and anti-tank gunners walked out of the club, which was boiling with laughter, and out of the warm and comfortable bunkers. They took up their weapons and braved the heavy wind and snow to engage in battle. When they returned, new stories of victorious battles spread. New poems and plays appeared in the club. The famous assault hero Li Qiuhe led three soldiers into the enemy camp one dark night, destroyed thirteen enemy tents, and eliminated more than a hundred enemies. The Tian Changmo assault team swam across the river in the cold night, climbed snow-covered mountains, and eliminated more than a hundred enemies in one night. The Park Sun-ok team crawled all night on the snow-covered ground to lay mines and destroyed enemy tanks that came to harass them. These all became new content for the soldiers to sing about.
    On the eastern front, the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the People's Army stood like eagles on the high mountains, victoriously passed the long cold winter, and welcomed the second fighting spring.

    英雄的欢乐
    ——记东线人民军的阵地生活
    新华社记者  何友
    朝鲜东部战线是一片绵互不绝的崇山峻岭。山上林木茂密，道路崎岖，许多地方终年不见人迹。春秋两季，山岭的高峰终日弥漫着白茫茫的大雾，入冬则大雪纷飞，积雪数尺。直到四月，当海风卷着寒流吹过山岭时，还飞着雪珠。就在这一片山高林密谷深流急的战线上，朝鲜人民军某部战士们把每一座山岭变成了坚不可摧的堡垒。
    初春，我访问了守卫在一千一百多公尺高的山岭上的人民军战士们。他们在这里克服了重重困难，创造了愉快的阵地生活。当我走进他们的阵地时，我看到三五成群的战士正坐在掩蔽部口歌唱“侦察兵之歌”，歌声在森林和群山间荡漾回应。在掩蔽部口的大树上，挂着战士们用白桦树皮代替纸张写的墙报。墙报上登载着战士们写作的“重机枪英雄朴观永战斗事迹”、“金石福用步枪击落敌机两架”等表扬战斗模范事迹和介绍战斗经验的文章。墙报上还贴着许多用红土、黄土、木炭等画的图表和漫画。在掩蔽部里，战士们安排了他们的战地之家。枪架上整齐地排列着擦得黑油油的自动枪，在墙旁边的木架上放着许多书籍和杂志，暖炕上铺着战士们用树皮编成的席，在“天花板”下面还挂着战士们从高山上采集来的一串串的红叶。富有艺术天才的战士们还把松树皮和树枝刻成山石和各种人物的形状，也有用浆糊调和泥土，在墙壁上画着带有强烈的民族色彩的“阵地景象”、“射击图”、“金刚山观日出”和“朝阳瀑布”等彩色壁画。这每一幅画都渗透着朝鲜战士们热爱自己祖国美丽河山的深厚感情。
    一位人民军连队的指挥员领我走进了战士们建筑的高大宽敞和明亮的“地下俱乐部”，这里可以容纳三百多人。俱乐部里设置着舞台，悬挂着斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席和金日成将军的巨幅画像。在墙壁的四周，挂着一幅幅贴在美制降落伞绸布上的从苏联画报、中国人民画报和朝鲜的画报上剪下来的图片，这些图片将俱乐部装饰得非常美观。在许多新制成的桌子上，还陈列着各种书报、画刊，放着扑克牌和各种棋子。战士们在每一次袭击敌人回来，或打退敌人进攻以后，就走到这里来看书、下棋或打扑克。
    人民军的每个官兵都嗜歌好舞，热爱文化娱乐活动。即使在最艰苦的战斗日子里，炮火浓烟也不能掩没他们的歌声；这种歌声和舞蹈，是这样强烈地体现了朝鲜民族火热的战斗意志。在我所访问过的每一个连队里，他们都成立有音乐小组、舞蹈小组、文艺小组和诗歌朗诵小组等，大部分战士和军官都参加这些组织。他们每月举行一次竞赛大会，在大会上被评为优秀的作品，就缮写成墙报稿、小册子或油印成专集，分发传诵。在战地“地下剧场”里，也经常举行联合公演。各兵种、各连队的战士们，都选出他们优秀的演员到这里来表演自己创作的优秀作品。他们把艰苦的战斗和紧张而愉快的阵地生活都搬上舞台。守卫在“伤心岭”附近的某部战士们，演出了两个嘲笑范佛里特在“伤心岭”惨败的剧本；这两个剧本叫“一二一一高地”和“巧在五点三十分”。另一个连队的战士们，集体创作了一个歌颂战士许锡在战斗中立功的剧本，剧名是“英雄许锡接到家信”。侦察兵们也编写了描写自己战斗生活的“敌后三十里”。战士们在自己的作品中刻画出了许多英雄的形象。
    我曾多次欣赏过人民军战士们的民谣独唱、诗歌朗诵和戏剧演出。如某部金敬哲战斗小组描写强大和平阵营的“千倍百倍”、“胜利”、“朝中亲善”等歌，强烈地反映了人民军战士们对自己力量的信赖和必胜信念。他们所表现的对敌人的憎恨和对人民的无比热爱都深深地使人感动。这正如一个年青的人民军通讯兵告诉我的：“现在我只有一种感情，就是痛恨敌人；一种愿望，就是消灭敌人；我们不是没有困难和艰苦，但革命的乐观与消灭敌人的决心总是赛过了它。”
    年青的人民军指挥员战斗员们就是怀着这样坚强的愿望和强烈的感情，坚决打击敌人。在漫长的严冬的夜里，在大雪覆盖着的山顶上，几乎每天都有捷报传来。袭击组员们、侦察队员们和反战车手们从沸腾着欢笑的俱乐部里走出来，从暖和舒适的掩蔽部里走出来，带上武器，冒着大风雪投入战斗。当他们回来的时候，新的胜利的战斗故事又传播开了。在俱乐部里，又出现了新的诗歌和剧本。著名的袭击英雄李求河带了三个战士在一个黑夜里袭入敌阵，炸毁了敌人的十三个帐篷，消灭了一百多个敌人。田昌模袭击小组在寒夜里泅过江水，攀登积雪的山岭，在一夜间消灭敌人一百多个。朴善玉小组整夜匍匐在雪地上埋设地雷，炸毁了前来窜扰的敌军战车。这些都成了战士们演唱的新内容。
    在东线阵地上，人民军某部的指挥员战斗员们像雄鹰一样屹立在高山之上，胜利地度过了漫长的寒冬，迎接着第二个战斗的春天。
