Shanghai has always been the largest speculative market in the country. Before liberation, the speculators of imperialism, compradorism, and bureaucratic capitalism ran rampant. Industrialists and businessmen could not stand firm without participating in speculation. With the deterioration of the Kuomintang reactionary government's inflation, the "careers" of Shanghai's speculators became increasingly "developed," and their methods became increasingly sophisticated. They did not engage in any production or any legitimate business at all, relying only on a telephone line to the stock exchange, able to buy in, sell out, conjure wind and rain, and plunder the people's wealth by the hundreds of millions overnight, becoming rich men.

After the liberation of Shanghai, although the speculative forces of imperialism and bureaucratic capital were eliminated, there were still about 200,000 people left who lived entirely by "scalping" and "passing the buck" in the market. These speculative elements among the Shanghai bourgeoisie, after liberation, disregarded the Common Program, ignored the repeated advice and warnings of the People's Government and the protests of the broad masses of the people, and continued to buy and sell short, hoard and speculate, and drive up prices in the market, forming a huge destructive force that harmed national construction and people all over the country.

Everyone hopes to live in peace and security, but Shanghai's speculative merchants fear nothing more than peace. No matter what disturbances occur at home or abroad, they spare no effort to stir up trouble, create price fluctuations, and market chaos, in order to fish in troubled waters and plunder the people's wealth on a large scale. Many nationwide price increases since liberation have been caused by the speculation of Shanghai's speculative merchants. In late June 1950, merely because some sections of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway were damaged by floods and transportation was temporarily blocked, Shanghai's speculative merchants seized the opportunity to drive up the price of rice. They not only followed the wind and waves to drive up prices; sometimes they even created waves out of nothing, artificially creating price increases. In order to create a price increase for a certain commodity, speculators in the hardware business specially sent out many "purchasing agents" to pretend to purchase everywhere. After these purchasing agents inquired in the market, they created a "bullish psychology." The bleaching powder price increase in July and August 1950 was completely artificially created. At that time, the representatives of the bleaching powder industry openly stated that they wanted to "push the price of bleaching powder ahead of the off-season, and then drop it to make a killing."

Shanghai's speculative merchants did not hesitate to spread rumors in order to disrupt the market and social order. In October 1950, the invading troops of U.S. imperialism frantically attacked the Yalu River, and the people of the whole country were tensely mobilized to organize volunteers to extinguish the flames of aggression; some speculative merchants in Shanghai took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that "World War III is about to break out" and "the coal company will not supply coal," causing panic and creating an unwarranted coal rush. From October 18 to early November, the market price of white coal was driven up from 410,000 yuan per ton to 800,000 yuan per ton, and the price of machine-made coal also increased by one-third, even causing citizens to be unable to buy coal for burning and affecting factory production. Later, the People's Government mobilized all transportation forces to transport a large amount of coal from the mining areas to Shanghai, which suppressed the panic buying. However, the losses suffered by the state and the people as a result are incalculable.

The predatory behavior of Shanghai's speculative merchants taking advantage of the fire is endless. In June 1950, they rushed to buy sugar and drove up sugar prices, causing two nationwide sugar price increases. In December 1950, U.S. imperialism announced an "embargo" on mainland China, and Shanghai speculators drove up the prices of hardware, Western medicines, and other imported goods. After the "February 6" bombing in 1950, the people of Shanghai worked hard to repair machines, restore production, and resist the air raids of the U.S.-Chiang planes. However, Shanghai's speculative merchants took the opportunity to drive up the prices of kerosene, candles, gasoline lamps, and other air-raid and fire-fighting supplies. Even fire-fighting yellow sand was hoarded in large quantities, and the price soared, which affected the measures of factories, organs, and citizens to defend against the U.S.-Chiang bombing.

The growth of state-owned trade has been welcomed by the broad masses of the people because it has stabilized prices, guaranteed people's livelihoods, and restricted market speculation. However, the speculative elements of the Shanghai bourgeoisie regard state-owned trading companies as thorns in their side. In addition to openly clamoring that state-owned companies "obstruct their freedom of trade" and demanding that state-owned companies abandon their leadership so that they can engage in speculation and manipulation of the market at will, they have also painstakingly tried to break into and sabotage these state-owned companies or seize these state-owned companies and turn them into tools for their speculation and profiteering over the past two years. Recently, nine state-owned companies in Shanghai, including grain, retail, and native products, have discovered in the "Three-Anti" struggle that the main business departments of the companies were mostly usurped by unscrupulous merchants or destroyed by them. The Shanghai Coal Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company found that there were as many as 51 spies collectively sent in by large coal merchants such as Lida and Zhenye. These large coal companies can obtain confidential information such as the company's internal business plans, price adjustment plans, and inventory and mining area acquisition costs at any time to carry out market speculation activities. The hog department of the hog marketing department of the East China Branch of China Native Products Company is another typical example of complete usurpation. Important positions in this department are all monopolized by pig merchants and brokers who have been inserted. These internal traitors colluded with the unscrupulous merchant groups of Qian Da Xin, Zheng Da, Yang Shunhe and other pig companies to carry out sabotage. Whenever the marketing department had a large stock of pigs, they would sit at home and go on strike in disguise, forcing the company to lower its list price; when the company did not have enough pigs in stock, in addition to organizing private purchases, they would send out a large number of purchasing agents to northern Jiangsu to compete with the company. They did not hesitate to use six purchasing stations to surround one of the company's purchasing stations, so that the company could not purchase pigs, allowing them to monopolize the Shanghai pork market. During the Spring Festival of 1950, the stability of vegetable and New Year's goods prices depended entirely on the stability of pork prices, but at this critical juncture, the pigs in the marketing department were snapped up. These unscrupulous merchants, in control of the pigs, drove the retail pork price up to 16,000 yuan per catty, while the company's list price was only 7,800 yuan per catty at that time. In this way, the unscrupulous merchants usurped the business and leadership of the state-owned company and openly plundered a large sum of wealth from the broad masses of the people in Shanghai.

Speculation and profiteering is a common illegal activity of the Shanghai bourgeoisie, but only the big speculative merchants can create speculative trends. Zou Zhaolin, the boss of Xintai Xieji, a large speculative yarn company known as "Three Changs are not as good as one Tai," was the chief culprit of the cotton yarn speculation in October 1949. The leaders of the nationwide sugar price increase in June 1950 were Cheng Shunkang, Li Meiquan, and other large sugar merchants who were the main persons in charge of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association. The white coal rush in October 1950 was initiated by large coal companies such as Lida, Zhenye, Rui Da, and Hongji. Weng Minru, director of the Shanghai Hardware Business Association, was one of the chief figures in the nationwide hardware speculation in May 1950... These big speculative merchants have huge amounts of capital, years of experience in speculation and profiteering, and even a complete set of personnel, institutions, and management methods for engaging in speculative activities. Take a look at the pomp and circumstance of Zou Zhaolin, the boss of the large speculative yarn company Xintai Xieji, during the cotton yarn price increase in 1949! He had two well-known "clever rats" in the stock exchange, three accounting experts who specialized in creating losses, and several banks and money shops, such as Asia, Liangzhe, and Qichang, that provided him with unlimited funds. Therefore, he could buy nearly 100 pieces of cotton yarn in one day and control the cotton yarn market. During the cotton yarn price increase in October 1949, he earned nearly 80 pieces of cotton yarn in just over a week, which was worth 200 million yuan at that time.

The manipulation and monopoly of these big speculative merchants not only plunders the property of the state and the people, but also destroys and merges other legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises.

In March 1950, the Central People's Government implemented nationwide financial and economic unity, which curbed inflation. At that time, due to the sudden disappearance of false purchasing power in the market, private industrial and commercial operations were temporarily depressed, and prices fell across the board. In order to protect private industrial and commercial enterprises, state-owned companies did not hesitate to adopt a policy of higher list prices than market prices, temporarily giving up part of the market to private industrial and commercial enterprises in order to maintain their operations and prevent prices from falling sharply. However, the three major cotton cloth companies, Xiedaxiang, Baodaxiang, and Xindaxiang, which accounted for one-half of the total capital of the Shanghai cotton cloth business, disregarded the overall situation and desperately lowered prices and sold short, almost seizing the entire market of the cotton cloth industry, forcing other companies in the same industry to lower their selling prices even further. At this time, they bought back in large quantities, plundered a great deal of wealth, and harmed the cloth factories so that they could not maintain their production at cost, and other cotton cloth shops also lost money or even went bankrupt.

For more than two years, the People's Government, with the assistance of the broad masses of the people, has given those big speculative merchants countless serious blows. However, the speculative nature of the illegal bourgeois elements in Shanghai is very stubborn. In the past year or so, speculative merchants have transferred materials and funds out of their accounts in large quantities to engage in black market activities. Last September, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government inspected a not-so-large Yongxing Hardware Store and discovered a secret warehouse that concealed 3 billion yuan of assets. Not long ago, Xia Yingkui, an unscrupulous merchant of the Da Zhonghua Electrical Materials Company, known as the "Tungsten Wire King," who was arrested, hoarded more than 3 million meters of tungsten wire outside the books. When the "Five-Anti" movement began, these speculators should have restrained themselves a little bit, right? But the fact is not so. Just in the last ten days of the month, around the official start of the "Five-Anti" struggle in Shanghai, a batch of materials purchased by the state-owned Shanghai Municipal Trade Trust Company to take care of the difficulties in the capital turnover of industrial and commercial enterprises, discovered more than 700 million yuan worth of substandard and damaged goods.

The harm of Shanghai's speculative merchants is nationwide, and the people of the whole country are angrily watching them. If they do not turn back, they will be severely punished by the law.

    唯恐天下不乱的上海投机商人
    新华社记者  张家炽
    上海，一向是全国最大的投机市场。解放以前，帝国主义、买办、官僚资本的投机家们猖狂一时，工商业者不参与投机是站不住脚的。随着国民党反动政府通货膨胀的恶化，上海投机家们的“事业”日益“发达”，手段也日益高明起来。他们甚至完全不从事半点生产或任何正当的营业，只凭一只通往交易所的电话，便能够吃进、抛出，呼风唤雨，一夜之间可以掠夺人民亿万财富，成为富翁。
    上海解放后，帝国主义和官僚资本的投机势力虽被消灭，但留下来的全靠在市场上“抢帽子”、“踢皮球”为生的人却有二十万左右。上海资产阶级中的这些投机分子，解放后不顾共同纲领，不听人民政府的一再劝说、警告和广大人民的抗议，继续在市场上买空卖空，囤积居奇，哄抬物价，形成了一种巨大的破坏力量，国家建设和全国各地人民都受到他们的危害。
    人人都希望平平安安过日子，但上海的投机商人却唯恐天下不乱。不论国内外有任何风吹草动的事情发生，他们便不惜兴风作浪，制造物价波动，市场混乱，以便于从中混水摸鱼，大肆劫掠人民财富。解放以来许多次全国性的物价涨风，很少不是由于上海投机商人的哄抬而引起的。一九五零年六月下旬，仅仅是因为浙赣铁路部分地段被大水冲坏，运输暂时受阻，上海的投机商人便乘机哄抬米价。他们不仅随风起浪，哄抬物价；有时甚至无风也起浪，完全人为地制造物价涨风。五金商业的投机家们为了制造某种商品的涨风，特地派出许多
    “采购员”到处假装采购，市场上经这些采购员一问，便造成了“看涨心理”。一九五零年七八月间的漂白粉涨风，便是完全人为地制造出来的，当时漂白粉业的代表人物公开表示要“把漂粉在淡季开始前先涨过头，然后再跌下来捞它一票。”
    上海的投机商人们为了扰乱市场和社会秩序，不惜制造谣言。一九五零年十月，美帝国主义侵朝军队疯狂地向鸭绿江边进攻，全国人民正紧张地动员起来，组织志愿军去扑灭侵略的火焰；上海的一部分投机商人却乘机大放谣言说：“第三次世界大战要打起来了”、“煤业公司不供应了”，弄得人心惶惶，凭空制造了一场白煤抢购风潮。自十月十八日到十一月初，白煤市价由四十一万元一吨哄抬到八十万元一吨，机制煤也上涨了三分之一，甚至一度使市民买不到煤烧，工厂生产也受到影响。后来人民政府动员一切运输力量，从矿区大量运煤到上海，才把这场抢购风潮平抑下去。但国家和人民因此而遭受的损失已不可计算。
    上海投机商人乘火打劫的强盗行为是举不完的。一九五零年六月，他们曾抢购食糖，哄抬食糖价格，引起两次全国性的食糖涨风。一九五零年十二月，美帝国主义宣布对中国大陆“禁运”，上海投机商就哄抬五金、西药及其他进口物资的价格。一九五零年“二六”轰炸后，上海人民努力修理机器，恢复生产，抵抗美蒋飞机的空袭。但上海的投机商人却乘机哄抬火油、洋烛、汽油灯及其他防空、消防用品的价格，甚至连防火用的黄砂也被大量囤积，售价飞涨，使得各工厂，机关和市民防御美蒋轰炸的措施受到影响。
    国营贸易的成长，受到了广大人民的欢迎，因为它稳定了物价，保障了人民生活，限制了市场投机活动。但上海资产阶级的投机分子却把国营贸易公司当做眼中钉，他们除了公开叫嚣国营公司“妨碍了他们的贸易自由”，要求国营公司放弃其领导权，好让他们来任意投机倒把，操纵市场外，两年来还处心积虑地暗中打进去破坏，或把这些国营公司夺过来变为他们投机倒把的工具。最近上海市粮食、零售、土产等九个国营公司在“三反”斗争中都发现公司内部的主要业务部门大多为奸商所篡夺，或遭到他们的破坏。中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市煤业公司发现由立达、振业等大煤商集体派进来的坐探多到五十一人。这些大煤号可以随时得到公司内部的业务计划、价格调整计划和仓库存量、矿区收购成本等机密来进行市场投机活动。中国土产公司华东区公司猪业运销部的毛猪部门，是另一个完全被篡夺的典型。这个部门里的重要职位全被打进来的猪商、掮客所包办。这些内奸和乾大新、正大、杨顺和等猪行的奸商集团里应外合进行破坏。每当运销部存猪多时，他们便坐在家里变相罢工，逼使公司降低牌价；当公司存猪不足时，他们除组织套购外，更派出大批采购员到苏北去与公司抢购。他们不惜以六个采购站来包围公司一个采购站，使公司采购不到猪只，让他们来垄断上海猪肉市场。一九五零年春节，蔬菜年货价格的是否平稳全在猪肉价格是否稳定，但就在这紧要关头，运销部门的猪只被抢购一空。这些奸商们掌握了猪只，便把零售肉价哄抬到一万六千元一斤，而当时公司牌价却只有七千八百元一斤。奸商们就这样篡夺国营公司的业务和领导权，向上海市广大人民公开地掠夺了一大笔财富。
    投机倒把，是上海资产阶级普遍的违法行为，但能够制造投机风潮的，只是那些大投机商人。著名的号称“三昌不如一泰”的大投机纱号鑫泰协记老板邹兆麟，便是一九四九年十月棉纱投机风潮的首脑分子。一九五零年六月全国性食糖涨风的为首者，是上海糖业公会的主要负责人程顺康、李梅泉等大糖商。一九五零年十月白煤抢购风潮，是立达、振业、瑞大、鸿基等大煤号发起的。上海五金商业公会主任委员翁敏如，是一九五零年五月全国性的五金器材投机风潮的首脑人物之一……。这些大投机商人拥有巨大的资金，有多年投机倒把的经验，甚至还有整套从事投机活动的人员、机构和经营方法。请看看大投机商人鑫泰协记纱号老板邹兆麟在
    一九四九年棉纱涨风中的一副排场吧！他手下拥有两名证券交易所中著名的“亨鼠”，三个制造赔账的会计专家，还有亚洲、两浙、其昌等几家银行、钱庄无限止地供给他头寸。因此他可以在一天之内吃进近百件棉纱，左右棉纱市场。一九四九年十月棉纱涨风中，他在一个多星期内便赚进了八十件棉纱，合当时价值便达两亿数千万元之巨。
    这些大投机商人的操纵、垄断，不仅掠夺国家人民的财产，也破坏、并吞其他正当的私营工商业。
    一九五零年三月，中央人民政府实行全国财经统一，抑止了通货膨胀。当时由于市场虚假购买力突然消失，私营工商业营业暂时萧条，物价全面下跌。国营公司为了保障私营工商业，曾不惜采取牌价高于市价的政策，暂时让出一部分市场给私营工商业者，以维持他们的营业，不使物价狂跌。但占上海棉布商业总资金二分之一的协大祥、宝大祥、信大祥三大棉布庄，竟不顾大局，拚命压低抛空，几乎夺取了棉布业的全部市场，逼使其他同业把售价降得更低，这时他们便大量补进，大大地掠夺了一笔财富，害得布厂生产不能保本，其他棉布商店也都赔本甚至倒闭。
    两年多以来，人民政府在广大人民的协助下曾给那些大投机商人以无数次严重的打击。但上海不法资产阶级分子的投机性是非常顽强的。最近一年多以来，投机商人更大批地把物资、资金逃出账外进行黑市活动。去年九月间，上海市人民政府检查了一家并不很大的永星五金店，便发现了一个隐匿三十亿元资财的秘密仓库。不久以前被逮捕的号称“钨丝大王”的大中华电器材料行奸商夏盈奎，在账外囤积了三百多万公尺的钨丝。“五反”运动开始时，这些投机家们应该可以收敛一些了吧？但事实不然，就在上月下旬上海市“五反”斗争正式开始前后，国营上海市贸易信托公司为了照顾工商业者资金周转困难而收购的一批物资中，却发现有七亿多元的次货、坏货。
    上海投机商人的危害是全国性的，全国人民都愤怒地注视着他们。如果他们再不回头，必将受到国法的严厉制裁。
