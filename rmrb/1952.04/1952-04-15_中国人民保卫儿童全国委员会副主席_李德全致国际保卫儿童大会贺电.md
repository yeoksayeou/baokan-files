To the representatives of the International Conference for the Defense of Children, parents of children from all countries, and all friends who care about children:

Representatives from fifty-four countries around the world are gathering in Vienna, the capital of Austria, to hold the International Conference for the Defense of Children. On behalf of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children, allow me to extend warm congratulations on the opening of the conference.

All those who care for children and love peace are concerned about and paying attention to the lives and safety of children all over the world. Due to the United States' frantic arms race policy, children in many countries (including the United States) are trapped in a tragic life of hunger, malnutrition, and lack of medical care, resulting in high mortality rates. Recently, the inhuman American aggressors have even openly and on a large scale spread various bacteria in Korea and China, poisoning the people and children of the two countries.

As the head of the "Investigation Team into the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism," I and all the members of the team went to the northeastern region of our country and the front lines of Korea to conduct on-the-spot investigations into the actual situation of the U.S. aggressors spreading bacteria. They spread dozens of types of bacteria-carrying insects such as flies, fleas, and mosquitoes, as well as various bacterial poisons. These bacteria are all artificially cultivated pathogens, and they are sprayed from airplanes at night and on cloudy and foggy days. In the areas where they were spread in Korea, including twenty-seven counties, the number of times they were spread, according to existing statistics, from January 28th to March 25th, has reached 322. In northeastern China, during the period from February 29th to March 21st, 175 batches of American planes, totaling 955 sorties, intruded into 70 counties and cities. Among them, a small number carried out bombing and strafing, while the vast majority were spreading bacteria. We have obtained conclusive evidence with our own eyes and ears that the American aggressors are conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare.

If the bacteriological warfare that the American aggressors have already carried out in China and Korea is not stopped, then the same disaster will befall the people and children of the whole world.

The International Conference for the Defense of Children is precisely to discuss how to prevent children around the world from suffering the threat of war, so that they can grow and thrive in a peaceful environment, so that they can receive the necessary food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, receive education, and enjoy other rights they deserve. To this end, I appeal to you to quickly rise up to sanction the U.S. for its crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare, defend children, and defend peace!

This conference concerns each of us, each family, each parent, and concerns the survival and happiness of our precious future generation. It will awaken all kind people around the world to unite and jointly shoulder the sacred responsibility of defending peace and children's rights. The Chinese people will resolutely stand together with all people around the world who care for and love children, and use the cultural and scientific achievements accumulated by mankind over thousands of years, and use all our wisdom to contribute to the noble cause of defending peace and defending children.

Finally, I pay my respects to the representatives of all countries attending the International Conference for the Defense of Children, which represents human conscience and compassion, and wish the conference success.

    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会副主席
    李德全致国际保卫儿童大会贺电
    国际保卫儿童会议的代表们，各国儿童的父母和一切关心儿童的朋友们：
    全世界五十四个国家的代表，正会聚在奥地利的首都维也纳，举行国际保卫儿童会议，让我代表中国人民保卫儿童委员会热烈祝贺大会的开幕。
    一切关怀儿童和爱好和平的人们，都在关切和注视着全世界的孩子们的生命和安全。由于美国疯狂的备战政策，许多国家（包括美国在内）的儿童们，陷于饥饿、营养不良、患病无医的悲惨生活，因而死亡率很高。最近灭绝人性的美国侵略者更在朝鲜和中国公开大规模地撒布各种细菌，毒害着中朝两国的人民和儿童。
    作为“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”的团长，我与全体团员分别到了我国的东北地区和朝鲜前后方，实地调查了美国侵略者撒布细菌的实际情况。他们撒布有苍蝇、跳蚤、蚊虫等带菌昆虫达数十种，以及各种带菌毒物多种。这些细菌都是经人工培植的病原菌，并用飞机在黑夜和多云雾的阴天作喷雾式撒布的。在朝鲜撒布的地区，包括二十七个郡（县），撒布的次数，据已有的统计自一月二十八日到三月二十五日止，已达三百二十二次。在中国的东北，自二月二十九日起到三月二十一日止的期间内，美国飞机一百七十五批、九百五十五架次侵入七十个县市活动，其中除少数进行轰炸扫射外，其余绝大多数是撒布细菌的。我们已经用自己的眼睛和耳朵，得到了美国侵略者进行大规模细菌战的确凿证据。
    美国侵略者已经在中朝两国进行的细菌战，如果不加以制止，那么，同样的祸害，就会落到全世界人民和儿童的头上。
    国际保卫儿童大会，正是要讨论怎样使全世界的孩子们不遭受战争的威胁，使他们能在一个和平的环境里，生长壮大，使他们能够得到必要的食物、衣料、住所和医药照料，受到教育，以及得到应享的其他权利。为此，我向你们呼吁，迅速起来制裁美国进行细菌战的罪行，保卫儿童，保卫和平！
    这次大会是关系着我们每个人，每个家庭，每个父母，关系着我们珍贵的未来一代的生存和幸福，它将唤起全世界一切善良的人们，团结起来共同担负起保卫和平与儿童权利的神圣责任。中国人民将坚决地和全世界一切关心爱护儿童的人们一起，用人类千百年积累下来的文化与科学成果，用我们所有的智慧来贡献于保卫和平及保卫儿童的崇高事业。
    最后我向代表着人类的良心与慈爱的国际保卫儿童会议的各国的代表们致敬礼，并祝大会的成功。
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会
    副主席李德全
    一九五二年四月十二日
