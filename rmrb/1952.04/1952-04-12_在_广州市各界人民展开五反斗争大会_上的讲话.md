Speech at the "Guangzhou People from All Walks of Life Launch the Five-Anti Campaign Rally"
Ye Jianying, Mayor of Guangzhou

Comrades of the city:

Today, Guangzhou's "Five-Anti" campaign—anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-shoddy workmanship and materials, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence—has begun its great march. At the Fourth Session of the Third Guangzhou People's Representative Conference held at the end of January, we issued a signal to launch the "Five-Anti" campaign first in Guangzhou and then in all cities of the province. For more than two months, after repeated mobilization, workers, shop assistants, and clerks were called upon to report violations, and the people of the city and legitimate industrialists and businessmen were called upon to draw a clear line between law-abiding and illegal activities and to participate in the reporting. We also encouraged illegal capitalists to confess voluntarily, and the government could grant lenient treatment. This great movement has now gained a good start. We have launched the prelude to the "Five-Anti" campaign in the four industries of new medicine industry, new medicine commerce, grain processing industry, and vegetable oil industry, and have achieved initial victories. The illegal capitalists in these four industries have either bowed their heads and confessed their crimes in front of the people after their evidence of crimes was completely exposed and revealed, or are about to be sanctioned by the people's government's laws because they resisted the "Five-Anti" campaign. During this period, the people of the city began to understand the significance of the "Five-Anti" campaign and the policies of the people's government; the workers bravely reported violations and resolutely fought back against the stubborn resistance of illegal capitalists; people from all walks of life in the city successively joined the ranks of the movement, extending the justice of denouncing illegal capitalists; the "Five-Anti" Campaign Committee of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee has mastered more than 100,000 pieces of important materials on capitalists' violations; and experience has been gained and cadres have been trained in the prelude. Thus, a very favorable situation has been created for the great march of the "Five-Anti" campaign.

Even in the prelude, the people of the city have seen the seriousness of the rampant attacks by the bourgeoisie in Guangzhou. In the new pharmaceutical industry, with only 235 households, more than 100 billion yuan of state property has been found to have been stolen and defrauded. They made and sold fake medicines, seriously injuring and disabling people's health, and even poisoning people's lives. The grain processing industry is one of the industries that has received the most entrusted processing and assistance from the state since liberation, and has therefore transformed from a state of dying to a state of prosperity. However, they have engaged in various frauds, stealing large amounts of grain, and even smuggling grain for export, exchanging moldy rice for the People's Liberation Army's grain and unemployment relief grain. They are ungrateful and repay kindness with malice to the extreme. The illegal capitalists in the vegetable oil industry colluded with imperialism, sending a large number of spies into the state's economic organs, making organized and planned attacks, stealing state economic intelligence, seriously undermining the management of foreign trade in vegetable oil, causing great losses to state property, and causing great losses to farmers in the producing areas. It should be particularly emphasized that Guangzhou is an import and export port, and therefore is the most acute place for economic struggle against imperialism. Any loophole in the struggle in this area will seriously affect the country's economic construction and the people's livelihood, and will also hit the legitimate operations of national industrialists and businessmen. If this loophole is allowed to expand, it may fundamentally affect the future of new democratic construction, and make it possible for the independent and autonomous new Chinese economy to return to the old semi-colonial Chinese economy. However, the illegal capitalists in Guangzhou disregard the interests of the state and the nation, smuggling strategic materials such as tungsten, tin, and antimony for export to aid the enemy, smuggling rice for export, and smuggling gold and silver for export. They also exchanged morphine, opium and other poisons, as well as many commodities harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood from imperialism for smuggling imports. When they operate necessary import and export goods, they speculate and take advantage of loopholes, create waves, import inferior goods as good goods, disrupt price policies, and resist state management. They engage in group smuggling, escape foreign exchange and exchange foreign exchange. It is undeniable that the lawless elements among the bourgeoisie in Guangzhou have completely violated the provisions of the Common Program of "implementing the control of foreign trade and adopting a protectionist trade policy," and have launched a rampant attack on the country's foreign trade policies and laws, seriously endangering the interests of the country and the people. The above facts prove that the unscrupulous bourgeoisie in Guangzhou, like those in other parts of the country, have exposed their ugly nature of being profit-oriented, shameless, and unscrupulous. Among them, some of the worst elements, attached to imperialism, directly help imperialism, and attack our People's China internally and economically! This kind of enemy-friend distinction, and the development of the crime of betraying the motherland, is particularly hateful! In response to this serious fact, the "Five-Anti" campaign in Guangzhou must be carried out with great fanfare and thunderous momentum. On the basis of the initial victory, at the time when the favorable situation for the struggle has emerged, the scale of the struggle must be further expanded, the results of the battle must be further expanded, and the "Five-Anti" campaign must be carried out to the end. , never "withdraw the troops" without a complete victory.

Comrades of the city! Today, the order for the great march of the "Five-Anti" campaign has been issued, and I call on you to immediately stand on your battle positions and fight more fiercely!

Workers and shop assistants of the city! You have shown your skills in the initial battle, and emerged as warriors with firm class positions, who can smash the various bribery, disintegration, and sabotage conspiracies of illegal capitalists, who can relentlessly fight against illegal capitalists and report their illegal facts, and who can lead their comrades to fight bravely and make illegal capitalists bow their heads and confess their crimes, such as Mo Derun, Li Quan, Lin Guangren, Chen Qing, Zeng Guochang, Chen Liumei, Chen Xinshang, Chen Yingshang, and Ou Runchu. They are now members of the "Five-Anti" Campaign Committee of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, which is the glory of the working class. I call on the workers and shop assistants of the city to take them as examples and forge ahead bravely.

Senior staff of the city! The victory of the initial battle is inseparable from your participation in the struggle. The vast majority of senior staff in the four industries were able to put aside the so-called "years of friendship between host and guest," reject or abandon the shameful temptations of illegal capitalists such as so-called dry shares and dividends, draw a clear class line, and participate in the reporting struggle. Because senior staff know the most about the capitalists' illegal facts, they hit the illegal capitalists' vital points, forcing them to disarm and surrender. Some senior staff with unclean hands, as long as they are determined to "wash their hands and wipe out the black marks," return to the ranks, and participate in the struggle, the people's government will not pursue them. I call on the senior staff of the city to unhesitatingly join the battle after raising their patriotic spirit, raising their class consciousness, and recognizing the bright and splendid future of the working class!

I call on the patriotic people of all walks of life in the city to continue the struggle, persist in the struggle, and exert great strength from all aspects!

To enable the bourgeoisie to engage in economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the premise of abiding by the Common Program and obeying the policies and laws of the people's government, and to help the state carry out planned economic construction; to enable them to achieve mutual benefit between public and private interests, and between labor and capital, develop production, and prosper the economy under the leadership of the working class and the state's economy, this is the basic purpose of this struggle.

If we do not eliminate the bourgeoisie's bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, our goals cannot be achieved. Therefore, eliminating the "five poisons" is the content of this struggle.

Comrades: Our "Five-Anti" campaign's guiding principles and policies are clear and firm. We will definitely implement the policy of "combining strictness and leniency, combining transformation and punishment." Based on existing materials and referring to Beijing's methods, we divide the city's 40,221 private industrial and commercial households into five categories: of which law-abiding households account for about 14 percent; basically law-abiding households account for about 58 percent; semi-law-abiding and semi-illegal households account for about 24 percent; and seriously illegal households and completely illegal households account for about 4 percent. We stipulate that all industrial and commercial households that can thoroughly explain their illegal activities since liberation, and whose tax evasion and shoddy workmanship and materials income in 1951 does not exceed 2 million yuan, are still considered basically law-abiding households. Those who exceed 2 million yuan but whose circumstances are not very serious, and who can thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and actively report others and make meritorious service, can also be considered basically law-abiding households. Seriously illegal households and completely illegal households are also handled according to the principle of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance."

According to the above guiding principles and policies, at this conference, we are prepared to deal with the four industries of new medicine industry, new medicine commerce, vegetable oil, and grain processing, and some construction industry households in this way. Among these industries and households, more than 100 companies, including Yongfa Pharmacy, New Guangzhou Construction Factory, and Maofenglong Rice Mill, have been granted lenient treatment because their illegal activities are not serious and they can confess thoroughly and guarantee that they will not commit them again, and can be issued notices. Jinmei and Yongxiang Pharmacies, which were originally seriously illegal households, have been treated as semi-law-abiding and semi-illegal households because of their thorough confession and meritorious reporting. In addition, the illegal capitalists of New Guang Pharmacy, Yongde and Hanmin Pharmacies, Great Wall Construction Factory, Renfeng Rice Mill, and Chengchang Bank of the vegetable oil industry not only committed serious illegal activities, but also resolutely resisted and must be punished! Among them, Hanmin Pharmacy originally belonged to a seriously illegal household, but was cunning and stubborn, and formed a "life and death alliance" with corrupt elements, and instigated the boss of Yongli Pharmacy to resist confession, and must be treated as a completely illegal household and severely punished! All illegal capitalists should know how to choose whether to take the road of confession or the road of resistance. If they still do not confess quickly, then the people's government will send its own inspection teams to those factories and shops that resist the "Five-Anti" campaign to thoroughly investigate. I warn the illegal capitalists that your resistance is ineffective and you will never escape the giant palm of the people!

Comrades! Guangzhou's "Five-Anti" campaign must be carried out in an orderly manner, and it is necessary to ensure that production and operation are not affected. Therefore, the people's government has decided to continue to entrust private industrial and commercial households with processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans. Workers throughout the city should produce while fighting, strictly supervise the capitalists, and prevent theft and fraud. Capitalists should also operate legally while confessing. At present, many capitalists have raised so-called "difficulties" and used "difficulties" as an excuse to stop work, stop salaries, and stop meals, which is completely an act of resisting the movement and cannot be forgiven. As for some small industrial and commercial households, which are relatively law-abiding and hope to end the movement as soon as possible and concentrate on production and operation, we are paying attention to this situation. However, the most effective way is for these industrial and commercial households to resolutely draw a clear line between law-abiding and illegal activities, quickly and thoroughly confess, and rise up to report major thieves, so that the "Five-Anti" campaign can be concluded victoriously in a timely manner. If you can do this, it will not only prove that you are law-abiding and have contributed to the "Five-Anti" campaign, and can be rewarded by the people's government, but also eliminate the five poisons of major thieves, which will be beneficial to all the people (including all legitimate industrialists and businessmen). Now the climax of the "Five-Anti" campaign is coming, and it is absolutely necessary for the "Five-Anti" Campaign Committee to announce the ten major disciplines of the "Five-Anti" campaign today, and for the people's government to establish a people's court to handle "Five-Anti" cases. I hope everyone will strictly abide by the discipline and ensure that the "Five-Anti" campaign is carried out in an orderly manner.

Comrades! The great march of the "Five-Anti" campaign has begun! This is the beginning of the main battle, and it is necessary to lay a more solid foundation for the complete victory of the "Five-Anti" campaign. The people of the city take action, and the working class of the city should stand at the forefront of the struggle and resolutely win the complete victory of this main battle. I firmly believe that our "Five-Anti" campaign, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee and Central South, under the leadership and command of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and on the basis of the initial victory in the past, we will definitely be able to achieve complete victory.

Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the Central People's Government! Long live Chairman Mao!

    在“广州市各界人民展开五反斗争大会”上的讲话
    广州市人民政府市长  叶剑英
    全市同胞们：
    今天，广州市的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的“五反”斗争大进军开始了。我们曾经在一月底举行的第四届第三次各界人民代表会议上发出了首先在广州市，然后在全省各市展开“五反”斗争的信号。两个多月来，经过反复动员，号召工人、店员和职员进行检举，号召全市人民和正当工商业家划清守法与违法界限，起来参加检举，对违法资本家也鼓励他们自动坦白，政府可以从宽处理，这个伟大的运动，现在已经获得良好的开端。我们在新药工业、新药商业、粮食加工业、植物油业等四个行业首先开展“五反”的序幕战，已经获得初步胜利了。这四个行业中的违法资本家，在他们的罪证完全被暴露、被揭发之后，或者在人民面前低头认罪，或者由于他们抗拒“五反”，而即将受到人民政府的法律制裁。在这个时期里，全市人民开始认识了“五反”运动的意义和人民政府的政策；工人们英勇地进行了检举，坚决回击违法资本家的顽抗；全市各界人民，先后投入运动的行列，伸张了声讨违法资本家的正义；市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会，已掌握了资本家违法的重要材料十多万件；在序幕战中，取得了经验，锻炼了干部。这样，就为“五反”斗争的大进军造成了非常有利的形势。
    仅仅在序幕战当中，全市人民已经可以看到广州市资产阶级的猖狂进攻的严重程度。新药业全行只有二百三十五户，被查出盗骗国家财产达一千亿元以上。他们制卖假药，严重地伤残人民的健康，甚至毒害人民的生命。粮食加工业，是解放以来接受国家委托加工扶助最多，因而从奄奄待毙转为欣欣向荣的行业之一，可是他们多方欺诈，大量盗窃，甚至偷运粮食出口，拿霉坏的大米套换人民解放军的粮食和失业工人救济粮。他们忘恩负义，恩将仇报，到了顶点。植物油业的违法资本家勾结帝国主义，派遣大批坐探打进国家经济机关，作有组织有计划的进攻，盗窃国家经济情报，严重地破坏了植物油的对外贸易的管理，使国家财产受到很大损失，使产区农民受到很大损失。应该特别强调指出：广州是个进出口岸，因而就是个在经济上对帝国主义斗争最尖锐的场所。在这方面的斗争中的任何一个漏洞，都要严重影响国家经济建设、人民群众生活，也打击民族工商业家的正当经营。这个漏洞如果任由它扩大，就有可能从根本上影响新民主主义建设的前途，使独立自主的新中国经济有回复到半殖民地的旧中国经济的可能。可是，广州市的违法资本家偏偏不顾国家民族的利益，偷运钨砂、锡、锑等战略物资出口资敌，偷运大米出口，偷运黄金、白银出口，又从帝国主义手里换来吗啡、鸦片等毒物以及许多有害国计民生的商品偷运进口。他们在经营必要的进出口物品时，则投机取巧，兴风作浪，进口劣货充好货，破坏价格政策，抵抗国家管理。他们集团走私，逃汇套汇。无可否认，广州市资产阶级中的不法分子，已完全违背了共同纲领中“实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策”的规定，向国家的对外贸易政策、法令进行猖狂的进攻，严重地危害国家人民的利益。上述事实证明，广州市不法的资产阶级和全国各地一样，他们唯利是图、寡廉鲜耻的丑恶本质，已暴露无遗了。其中有一部分最坏的分子，依附着帝国主义，直接帮助帝国主义，在国家内部，在经济方面，向我们人民中国进攻！这种敌我不分，并发展为背叛祖国的罪行，特别令人痛恨！针对这种严重事实，广州市的“五反”斗争，必须大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地，在初战胜利的基础上，在斗争有利形势已经出现的时机，进一步扩大斗争的规模，进一步扩张战果，把“五反”斗争进行到底，不获全胜，决不“收兵”。
    全市同胞们！今天，“五反”斗争大进军的号令下达了，我号召你们立即站到战斗岗位上，更加猛烈地作战吧！
    全市工人、店员们！你们在初战中，大显身手，并涌现了像莫德润、黎权、林广仁、陈清、曾国昌、陈六妹、陈欣尚、陈盈赏、欧润初那样阶级立场坚定的、能够粉碎违法资本家各种收买分化破坏阴谋的、能够不容情地和违法资本家斗争、检举他们的违法事实的、能够带领同伴奋勇斗争、使违法资本家低头认罪的战士，他们现在成为市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会的委员，这是工人阶级的光荣。我号召全市工人、店员，以他们作榜样而奋勇前进。
    全市高级职员们！初战的胜利和你们的参加斗争是分不开的。四个行业的绝大部分的高级职员，能够丢开所谓“多年宾主”的情面，拒绝或抛掉违法资本家的所谓入干股、分红利等等可耻诱惑，划清阶级界限，参加检举斗争。因为高级职员知道资本家的违法事实最多，所以击中了违法资本家的要害，使他们不得不缴械称降。有些手面不干净的高级职员，只要决心“洗手擦黑”，回返队伍，参加斗争，人民政府都不加追究。我号召全市高级职员，在提高爱国主义精神、提高阶级觉悟、认识工人阶级的光辉灿烂的前途后毫不犹疑地投入战斗！
    我号召全市各界爱国人民继续斗争，坚持斗争，从各方面发挥伟大的力量！
    要使资产阶级在遵守共同纲领，服从人民政府的政策、法令之下，从事有利于国计民生的经济事业，帮助国家进行有计划的经济建设；要使他们在工人阶级和国家经济领导之下，实现公私兼顾，劳资两利，发展生产，繁荣经济，这就是这次斗争的基本目的。
    不肃清资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料，盗窃国家经济情报，我们的目的就不可能达到。因此，肃清“五毒”，就是这次斗争的内容。
    同胞们：我们的“五反”斗争的方针政策，是明确而坚定的。我们一定贯彻“严肃与宽大相结合，改造与惩治相结合”的方针。我们根据现有材料，参照北京的办法，把全市私人工商业四万零二百二十一户分为五类：其中守法户约占百分之十四；基本守法户约占百分之五十八；半守法半违法户约占百分之二十四；严重违法户和完全违法户共约占百分之四。我们规定凡工商业户能将解放以来的违法行为彻底交代清楚，而他们在一九五一年偷税漏税、偷工减料所得不超过二百万元的，仍算做基本守法户。其超过二百万元而情节不甚严重，又能彻底坦白，真诚悔过，并积极检举他人而立功者，亦可算做基本守法户。严重违法户和完全违法户，也根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的原则处理。
    根据上述方针政策，在这次大会上，我们对新药工业、新药商业、植物油、粮食加工四个行业和部分营造业户准备作这样的处理。在这些行业和业户中有永发药房、新广州营造厂、茂丰隆米机厂等一百多家因违法行为不重又能坦白彻底保证不再犯，因而获得了宽大处理，可以发给通知书。金美、永祥两药房，本系严重违法户，因坦白彻底检举有功，得作为半守法半违法户处理。此外，新光药厂，永德、汉民两药房，长城营造厂，仁丰米机厂和植物油业的成昌行等的违法资本家，不特违法严重，还坚决抗拒，一定要惩办！其中汉民药房本属严重违法户，但狡猾顽抗，与贪污分子订立“生死同盟”，唆使永利药房老板抗拒坦白，必须作为完全违法户，从严处办！一切违法的资本家，到底想走坦白的道路，还是走抗拒的道路，应该知所抉择了。如果还不迅速坦白，那么人民政府即将派出自己的检查队进驻那些抗拒“五反”的厂店，彻底清查。我警告违法资本家们，你们的顽抗是无效的，决计逃不开人民的巨掌！
    同胞们！广州市的“五反”斗争必须有秩序地进行，并要保证生产和经营不受影响，因此人民政府决定继续向私营工商户委托加工、定货、收购和贷款。全市工人应该一面斗争，一面生产，严格监督资方，不使盗窃欺骗。资本家也应一面坦白，一面守法经营。目前有许多资本家，提出所谓“困难”，藉口“困难”来停工、停薪、停伙，这完全是抗拒运动的行为，决不能宽恕。至于有些小工商业户，比较守法，希望早日结束运动，安心生产经营，这种情形我们是注意的。但最有效的办法，是这些工商业户要坚决划清守法与违法界限，一面迅速彻底坦白，一面起来检举大盗窃犯，使“五反”斗争可以适时地全胜地结束。你们能够这样做，不仅足以证明你们的守法，对“五反”斗争有了贡献，可以受到人民政府的奖励，而且消除了大盗窃犯的五毒，对于全体人民（自然包括一切正当的工商业者在内）都是有好处的。现在“五反”斗争的高潮就要到来了，“五反”运动委员会今天公布“五反”运动的十大纪律，人民政府成立处理“五反”案件的人民法庭，是完全必要的。希望大家严格遵守纪律，保证“五反”运动有秩序地进行。
    同胞们！“五反”斗争大进军开始了！这是主力战的开始，要为“五反”运动的全胜打下更加巩固的基础。全市人民行动起来，全市工人阶级更应站在斗争的前列，坚决取得这一场主力战的全部胜利。我坚决相信，我们的“五反”斗争，有毛主席和中央、中南的英明领导，在中国共产党广州市委员会、广州市人民政府及市总工会领导和指挥下，在过去初战胜利的基础上，我们一定能够获得全部的胜利。
    中国共产党万岁！中央人民政府万岁！毛主席万岁！
