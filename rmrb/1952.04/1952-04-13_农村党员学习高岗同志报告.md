    Rural Party Members Study Comrade Gao Gang's Report
    Editor: The Party members of the Beiganquan Branch, Fifth District, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, of the Communist Party of China, after studying Comrade Gao Gang's report "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development," exposed and overcame many erroneous ideas and improved their confidence in developing mutual aid and cooperative production.
    This branch has a total of twenty-nine Party members. In the past, many people were unwilling to join agricultural production cooperatives. Although seven Party members had joined the cooperatives, they did not understand its significance ideologically and were purely responding to the call of higher authorities. Some Party members believed that it was difficult to lead peasants to organize. Some Party members did not educate peasants to organize voluntarily, but instead implemented compulsory orders. Some Party members engaged in mutual aid because they were afraid of criticism from above. On the other hand, some Party members developed an exploitative ideology. For example, Wang Chaoxi had several shi of surplus grain at home and wanted to lend it out to earn more interest.
    After studying, the Party members realized that the small-peasant economy is a very unstable economy, and only by gradually moving towards the road of agricultural production cooperatives can they gradually get rid of poverty. Wang Chaoxi said, "I now understand that the Party leads the peasants to first implement land reform, turning the feudal land ownership system into a peasant land ownership system, and the second step is to organize the peasants to achieve adequate food and clothing." After studying, the Party branch strengthened its leadership over the peasants in the whole village, and many comrades expressed: "We must do a good job in our village." Comrade Jin An'yi said: "Doing a good job in leadership is completely consistent with one's own interests. The year before last, I did not participate in the mutual aid group, and the wheat was neither hoed nor top-dressed, resulting in a reduction of two shi and eight dou of grain. Last year, I participated in the mutual aid group, and the output increased."
    Due to the study of Comrade Gao Gang's report, the confidence of the Party members of the Beiganquan Branch in guiding peasants to organize and develop production has increased. Comrade Guan Maosong said: "In the past, although I participated in the agricultural production cooperative, I did not understand what the benefits were. Now I understand it, and I really have to do a good job." All the Party members of the branch assured the Party that they would definitely achieve long-term mutual aid, abide by the principle of voluntary equivalence, and create conditions for consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives.

    农村党员学习高岗同志报告
    编辑同志：中共山西省平顺县五区北甘泉支部的党员，学习了高岗同志“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告，揭发和克服了很多错误思想，提高了发展互助合作生产的信心。
    这个支部共有二十九个党员，过去许多人都不愿意加入农业生产合作社；虽然有七个党员入了合作社，但思想上并没有搞清它的意义，只是纯粹为了响应上级号召。有的党员认为，领导农民组织起来是件难事；有的党员不是教育农民自愿组织起来，而是实行强迫命令；有的党员搞互助是因为怕上级批评。另一方面，某些党员，却滋长了一种剥削思想，如王朝喜家里有几石余粮，就想借贷出去多得点利。
    经过学习，党员认识了小农经济是很不稳定的经济，只有逐步走向农业生产合作社的道路，才能逐渐摆脱贫困。王朝喜说：“我现在明白了，党领导农民首先实行土地改革，把封建土地所有制变成农民土地所有制，第二步就是把农民组织起来，达到丰衣足食。”经过学习，党支部加强了对全村农民的领导，很多同志表示：“一定要把咱村工作搞好。”靳安意同志说：“做好领导工作和自己利益是完全一致的，前年我没有参加互助组，麦子没锄也没上追肥，结果少打了两石八斗粮食，去年参加了互助组，产量就增加了。”
    由于学习了高岗同志的报告，北甘泉支部的党员引导农民组织起来发展生产的信心提高了。关毛松同志说：“过去我虽参加了农业生产合作社，但不明白究竟有什么好处，现在可弄清了，真得好好地干。”支部全体党员纷纷向党保证一定要作到长年互助，遵守自愿等价的原则，为巩固与发展农业生产合作社创造条件。乔高陞
