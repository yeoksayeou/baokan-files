    Suggesting Planting More Trees in Open Spaces, Along Rivers, and Roadsides
    In today's era of active national construction and the people's government's call for afforestation, I suggest that local leading organs should pay attention to organizing farmers to plant more trees on both banks of rivers, along roadsides, around sports fields, and on both sides of wide streets. For example, there are still very few trees planted on both banks of the Fuyang River in Hebei Province and along the Cangshi Road base. According to my understanding, these places are suitable for planting poplar, willow, and elm trees, which are easy to plant and grow. Now is the season for planting trees, and I hope we can seize this opportunity to plant more trees and educate the masses to cherish trees and ensure their survival. In the future, when the trees grow into forests, it will be of great benefit to drought and wind prevention and climate regulation. Zhang Xinsheng

    建议各地在空场、河流和公路两旁多植树
    在国家积极建设，人民政府号召植树造林的今天，我建议各地领导机关应注意组织农民，在河流两岸，公路两旁，运动场的四周，宽大街道的两旁多多栽树。如河北省滏阳河两岸，沧石路基两旁，现在都还植树很少。据我了解，这些地方都适宜种植杨、柳、榆树，这些树好栽也容易成长。现在正是植树时节，我希望能抓紧这个时节多多栽树，并教育群众爱护树木，保栽保活。将来树大成林，对防旱防风和气候的调节都有很大好处。张新生
