    The Udan County People's Court of Rehe Province Gave Too Light a Sentence in the Case of Qu Hongliang and His Mother Beating a Pregnant Woman to Death

    Editor: A serious incident occurred in Erdaogou Village, Udan County, Rehe Province, in February of last year, in which a mother-in-law and her son beat a pregnant woman, Ms. Nian, to death.

    The victim, Ms. Nian, was thirty years old at the time of her death and was from Xiaolanqiyingzi Village, Taipinggou Village, Udan County. Ms. Nian was arranged into marriage at the age of eighteen to Qu Hongliang of Erdaogou Village in the same county. After the marriage, Ms. Nian was often subjected to all kinds of abuse by her mother-in-law, husband, and younger sister-in-law, even to the point of not being able to wear shoes and socks. The year before last, when Ms. Nian returned to her parents' home during the old lunar December, her family made her a pair of socks to wear because of the severe cold. Ms. Nian herself had engaged in sideline production, weaving straw hats, and had saved half a dou (more than 40 jin) of red sorghum in her own cabinet, planning to sell it later to buy some cloth to make shoes and socks. After Ms. Nian returned from her parents' home, she discovered that the red sorghum was missing. When she asked her family, she learned that her mother-in-law had taken it from the cabinet and fed it to the pigs. She was very angry, but there was nothing she could do. Later, Ms. Nian's father-in-law bought her two chi of blue cloth, but her younger sister-in-law found out about it and snatched it away, telling her mother-in-law. After her mother-in-law found out, she beat Ms. Nian with a stick and incited her son to beat her as well, shouting that they would beat Ms. Nian to death. Thereupon, Qu Hongliang raised a hoe handle and beat her fiercely, breaking the hoe handle into three pieces. Ms. Nian was beaten until her entire body was black and blue, and bleeding profusely. Ms. Nian, who was already more than seven months pregnant, repeatedly begged her husband to spare her life, but Qu Hongliang still did not stop and beat her even more viciously. Unable to bear it any longer, Ms. Nian broke free and jumped out of the window, fleeing to the garden of her neighbor, Old Hou. But Qu Hongliang still did not let go and chased after her from the house with an iron shovel, using the shovel to chop her three times, beating Ms. Nian until she could no longer get up. Old Hou's family heard the noise and rushed over, and Qu Hongliang finally stopped beating her. Neighboring women helped Ms. Nian into the house, and about five minutes later, Ms. Nian began to vomit blood incessantly. The pitiful Ms. Nian and the child she was carrying were beaten to death by her mother-in-law and husband.

    After the incident, Ms. Nian's mother-in-law colluded with village cadres, causing the case not to be judged in a timely manner. After several appeals from the deceased's family, the county people's court only sentenced the murderer Qu Hongliang to twenty years in prison last May, but Ms. Qu Hongliang's mother was not sentenced. No punishment was given to the village cadres either. We believe that they should all be punished and hope that the county will retry the case to appease public anger.

    热河省乌丹县人民法院对曲洪良母子打死孕妇案判处过轻
    编辑同志：热河省乌丹县二道沟村，在去年二月间，发生了一件婆婆和丈夫打死孕妇年氏的严重事件。
    被害妇女年氏，死年三十岁，乌丹县太平沟村小兰旗营子人。年氏十八岁时由家庭包办，和同县二道沟村曲洪良结婚。结婚后，年氏常受婆婆、丈夫、小姑等百般虐待，甚至连鞋袜都穿不上。前年旧历腊月年氏回娘家时，因天气严寒，才由娘家给做了一双袜子穿上。年氏自己曾搞副业生产编草帽，积下红高粱半斗（四十余斤）放在自己柜里，准备以后卖了钱买些布做鞋做袜子。年氏从娘家回来后，发觉红高粱不见了，问家里人，才知道是婆婆从柜里拿出来喂了猪。她非常气愤，但也没法。后来年氏的公公买了二尺青布给她，又被小姑子知道而抢了去，并告诉了她的婆婆。她婆婆知道后，用棍子打了年氏一顿，并唆使她儿子也打，叫着要打死年氏。于是曲洪良便举起锄头杆子狠狠地打她，把锄杆打成了三截，年氏被打得周身皮青肉紫，鲜血淋漓。身已怀孕七个多月的年氏，不断地向丈夫哀呼饶命，可是曲洪良仍不放手，越打越狠。打得年氏实在无法，便挣脱从窗户跳出，逃到邻居老侯家的园中。但曲洪良仍不放松，又从屋里举着铁锹追出去，用铁锹狠狠地连砍了三下，打得年氏再也爬不起来。老侯家闻声赶到，曲洪良才住打。邻居妇女把年氏扶到屋里，约过五分钟后，年氏便吐血不止。可怜的年氏和她所怀的孩子就被婆婆和丈夫活活地打死了。
    事后，年氏的婆婆便拉拢村干部，致使案件未及时判决。经死者娘家几次申诉，于去年五月后，县人民法院才判处凶犯曲洪良徒刑二十年，但对曲洪良的婆婆却没有判处。对该村干部也没有处分。我们认为他们都是应该受惩处的，希望该县重判该案，以平民愤。
