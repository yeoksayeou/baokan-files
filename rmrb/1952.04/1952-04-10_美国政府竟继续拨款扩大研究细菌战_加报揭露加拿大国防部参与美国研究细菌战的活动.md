Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The American aggressors, who are frantically using heinous bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, are flagrantly disregarding the strong protests of the people of the world and are expanding the research and preparation of germ warfare with even more funds.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 6th, the U.S. Army is very confident that it will be able to obtain more funds from Congress next year to study germ warfare. The news revealed: "Part of the Army's $450 million research and development budget is related to germ warfare. When the House Appropriations Committee cut $4.1 billion from the new $52 billion in funding for the fiscal year beginning July 1, this project remained untouched." Reuters reported: "This amount is $23 million more than last year." The aforementioned Associated Press dispatch admitted: "The testimony published by the (Appropriations) Subcommittee shows that the military authorities are using the increased funding to continue research on germ warfare."

The U.S.'s criminal activities of increasing funding for research and preparation of germ warfare can also be proved by the remarks of General Bullene, commander of the U.S. Chemical Corps, who is responsible for leading the germ warfare effort. He unscrupulously and publicly declared that "a supplementary appropriation has been requested for conducting experiments in biological warfare," and admitted that this was because American imperialism "attaches more importance to biological warfare and is quite nervous about it, so it has requested increased funding" (Reuters, Washington, March 30th).

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: More and more materials prove that the American aggressors and their servant countries have long been engaged in the criminal activities of researching and preparing for germ warfare. According to a recent exposé in the Canadian Tribune, the organ of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, the Canadian "Defence Research Board" is an organization that colludes with American imperialism to specialize in the research of germ weapons and other cruel killing weapons. As early as 1949, the Montreal Standard stated that the Director of the Defence Research Board, Solandt, "knows more ways to kill than anyone else."

In newspaper reports, Solandt's name was mentioned together with the name of Dr. Morely, a professor in the Department of Bacteriology at McGill University in Montreal. Morely is an authority on meningococcus, which is one of the bacteria used by the American aggressors in Korea and China. This bacterium is the pathogen of spinal meningitis.

The Canadian Tribune said that scientists from Canada, the United States, and Britain held a three-day meeting in a chapel in Ottawa from March 15, 1950, and conducted extremely secret discussions. The opening meeting was chaired by Solandt. The Canadian Press reported at the time that the meeting discussed Solandt's achievements in researching germ warfare, chemical warfare, and other tactics, and said: "Supporting Solandt's work is an exchange system. According to this system, Canada specializes in research on germ warfare, poison gas warfare, and Arctic warfare, and transfers the research results to other countries in exchange for research results in other fields."

Solandt spoke at a meeting of a Canadian youth club in Toronto on March 3 of this year, saying that one-third of the Canadian Defence Research Board's budget is used to research atomic weapons, germ weapons, and chemical warfare weapons. The Defence Research Board's budget was 13 million Canadian dollars four years ago, and it is now 42 million Canadian dollars.

### 美国政府竟继续拨款扩大研究细菌战  加报揭露加拿大国防部参与美国研究细菌战的活动

    美国政府竟继续拨款扩大研究细菌战
    加报揭露加拿大国防部参与美国研究细菌战的活动
    【新华社九日讯】正在朝鲜和中国疯狂地使用罪恶的细菌武器的美国侵略者，悍然不顾全世界人民的强烈抗议，正在以更多的款项扩大研究和准备细菌战。
    据美联社华盛顿六日电透露：美国陆军很有把握明年能从国会得到更多的经费，以研究细菌战。该消息透露：“陆军的四亿五千万元研究和发展预算中有一部分是关于细菌战争的。当众议院拨款委员会从七月一日开始的这一财政年度的五百二十亿元的新经费中削减四十一亿元时，这一项目原封未动。”据路透社称：“这个数目比去年度增加了二千三百万美元。”而上述美联社的消息承认：从“（拨款）小组委员会所发表的证明可以看出，军事当局利用增加了的经费以继续研究细菌战争。”
    美国增加经费从事研究和准备细菌战的罪恶活动还可以从负责领导进行细菌战的美国化学兵团司令布伦的谈话中得到证明。他肆无忌惮地公然宣称，“已经要求增拨经费，用以进行生物战的试验”，并且承认：这是因为美帝国主义“更加重视生物战，并且对此相当紧张，所以要求增加经费”（路透社华盛顿三月三十日电）。
    【新华社八日讯】愈来愈多的材料证明美国侵略者曾和它的仆从国家一起长期从事研究和准备细菌战的罪恶活动。据加拿大劳工进步党机关报“加拿大论坛报”最近揭露，加拿大的“国防部科学研究处”就是和美帝国主义互相勾结专门研究细菌武器和其他残酷的杀人武器的机构。早在一九四九年，“蒙特利尔旗帜报”就说：国防部科学研究处处长索伦德“所知道的杀人方法，比任何人所知道的都多”。
    在报纸消息中，索伦德的名字和蒙特利尔麦克济大学细菌学系教授莫雷的名字是被一同提及的。莫雷是研究脑膜炎双球菌的权威。脑膜炎双球菌是美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国所使用的细菌的一种。这种细菌是脊髓脑膜炎的病原菌。
    “加拿大论坛报”说：加拿大、美国和英国的科学家曾经从一九五○年三月十五日起在渥太华的一个礼拜堂里举行了三天的会议，进行了极端秘密的讨论，开幕会议是由索伦德主持的。“加拿大通讯社”当时曾经报道：这次会议讨论了索伦德在研究细菌战、化学战和其他战术方面所获得的成就，并说：“支持索伦德的工作的，是一种交换制度，根据这种制度，加拿大就专门致力于细菌战、毒气战和北极战的研究，并将研究所得转告给其他国家，向其他国家换取其他方面的研究结果。”
    索伦德今年三月三日曾经在多伦多一个加拿大青年俱乐部的会议上演说，他说：加拿大国防部科学研究处的预算，三分之一是用来研究原子武器、细菌武器和化学战武器的。国防部科学研究处的预算费用四年前是一千三百万加拿大元，现在已经是四千二百万加元了。
