    People's Bank of China, Xinxiang Branch
    Compels Peasants to Purchase Savings Bonds
    Seriously Affecting Spring Planting Production
    Editor's Note: According to our understanding, the People's Bank of China, Xinxiang Branch, has taken necessary measures to correct the above-mentioned bias after it occurred. However, local branches of the People's Bank of China must learn from the above incident and prevent similar situations from happening.
    Editor: When the People's Bank of China, Xinxiang Branch, promoted prize-bearing savings bonds to local farmers, it adopted extremely bad methods of compulsory distribution, causing dissatisfaction among farmers and hindering spring planting production. In order to complete the "task" of the ninth issue of prize-bearing savings bonds, the Xinxiang Branch sent thirty or forty cadres to launch a "savings purchase red flag competition" in the countryside, assigning "contract tasks" to the villages and letting village cadres force the masses to self-report, discuss publicly, and implement distribution based on land area. In Matou Fifth Village (400 households) of the Fifth District of Xinxiang County alone, 2,000 shares were "contracted." After the village government distributed the savings quota to the masses, one farmer led his livestock to the village government and said to the village chief: "I have no money, however much this livestock sells for, just use it to pay for the savings bonds!" The cadres of Jinglou Village in the Fifth District convened a mass meeting to promote prize-bearing savings bonds, and the meeting was not dismissed until the on-the-spot subscriptions were completed, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the masses. Farmers in the Third District of the county sold fewer prize-bearing savings bonds in the eighth issue, and this time more than 100 million yuan was allocated. The masses reflected: "How much will it be next time?" Some people in the Fourth District said: "The principal from last time has not been repaid, and it has already delayed the purchase of fertilizer. This time we are asked to buy fertilizer again, and we are asked to buy prize-bearing savings bonds, I don't know what to buy!" These cadres not only did not listen to the opinions of the masses, but absurdly said: "Buying prize-bearing savings bonds is patriotic, the lottery will be drawn on the 27th, you might win a prize, the deadline cannot be missed, it's okay to buy fertilizer a few days later." The Fourth District's Qiliying (more than 900 households) was assigned the task of selling 500 million yuan of prize-bearing savings bonds this time, which made the masses unable to purchase the fertilizer urgently needed for spring planting production. Qianlou Village originally planned to dig 30 brick wells, but because of purchasing the allocated savings bonds, it had to change the original plan and reduce the number of wells to 20. I believe that this practice of the People's Bank of China, Xinxiang Branch, is very wrong and should be quickly corrected.

    人民银行新乡支行
    强迫农民购买储蓄券
    严重影响了春耕生产
    编者按：据我们了解，人民银行新乡支行在发生上述偏向后，已采取必要的措施予以纠正。但各地人民银行支行必须对上述事件引为教训，防止类似情况发生。
    编辑同志：人民银行新乡支行向当地农民推销有奖储蓄券时，采取了极端恶劣的强迫摊派的方法，引起农民不满，妨碍了春耕生产。新乡支行为了完成第九期有奖储蓄券的“任务”，曾经派了三、四十个干部，在乡村发动“购储红旗竞赛”，给村上分配“包干任务”，让村干部强迫群众自报公议、按地亩实行摊派。只新乡县五区马头五村（四百户）就“包干”二千分，村政府把储蓄数派给群众后，一个农民把牲口牵到村政府，向村长说：“我没钱，这牲口卖多少，就顶了储蓄票吧！”五区荆楼村干部，召集群众大会推销有奖储蓄券，当场认购不完就不散会，引起群众极端不满。该县三区农民推销第八期有奖储蓄券数量较少，这次分配了一亿多元，群众反映：再一次不知该多少呢！四区有的群众说：“上次的本未还，已经误了买肥料。这次又叫买肥料，又叫买有奖储蓄券，不知到底买啥好！”这些干部不但不听取群众意见，竟荒谬地说：“买有奖储蓄券是爱国，二十七日就开奖，可能得奖，期限不能误了，肥料晚几天买还可以。”四区七里营（九百余户）这次分配了推销有奖储蓄券五亿元的任务，致使群众再无力购买春耕生产所急需的肥料。前楼村原计划打砖井三十眼，但因购买分配下的储蓄券，不得不改变原来的计划，把打井数减少到二十眼。我认为人民银行新乡支行这种作法，是非常错误的，应迅速设法纠正。    李天久
