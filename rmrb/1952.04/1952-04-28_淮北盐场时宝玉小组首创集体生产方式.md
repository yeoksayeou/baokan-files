    Huaibei Salt Field: Shi Baoyu Group Pioneers Collective Production Method
    The Shi Baoyu group of the State-owned Huaibei Salt Field in northern Jiangsu Province has pioneered an advanced collective production method. This production method unleashed the potential of production and became an important starting point for changing the face of production at the Huaibei Salt Field. It is currently being widely promoted throughout the field.
    The production at the Huaibei Salt Field followed an old production system: the contract system, which used the "tan" (a "tan" is a basic production unit in the salt field, including reservoirs, evaporation ponds, crystallization ponds, brine ponds, etc.) as the production unit and family labor as the main body. The allocation of labor on each "tan" was extremely unreasonable, and labor quotas were not precise. The various operations in the entire production process, such as water pumping, pan washing, salt planting, and salt scraping, lacked specialized division of labor, making it difficult to improve technology. The level of salt production mainly depended on the size and quality of the "tan" land and the quality of the equipment, making it unsuitable for implementing a piece-rate wage system. All of this greatly hindered the improvement of productivity. Therefore, although the output of Huai salt has increased year by year in recent years, the quality has not improved, and the cost has not decreased. The Shi Baoyu group's method was proposed in response to these shortcomings.
    Shi Baoyu is a Communist Party member. Last year, when the field carried out the patriotic production increase competition for spring cleaning, he led the salt workers of the entire "wei" (each "wei" contains four to eight "tan") to study how to strive for overproduction with new innovations, and proposed a collective production method. He first gave up his own interests in the high output of his good "tan" land, united the advanced salt workers in the "wei," and conducted ideological education on public ownership of the "tan" land and the principle of "more work, more pay," targeting the backward "tan ownership rights" (private ownership of "tan" land) private ideas among the salt workers. He established the first collective production group in the field. The collective production group takes the "wei" as the production unit, with public ownership and shared use of the means of production, unified allocation of labor, precise division of labor, and implements a production group leader responsibility system, so that labor is used reasonably, each person gives full play to their strengths, and manpower is saved. For example, in the past, each "tan" required two people to be specifically responsible for managing windmills and stacking salt, but now the entire group of four "tan" only needs two people. In terms of wages, the principle of distribution according to labor is adopted, similar to a workshop contracting group in a factory. In order to ensure the smooth progress of collective production, the group also established various systems, such as work and rest systems, inspection systems, and wage evaluation systems, which are jointly observed.
    The superiority of collective production is first manifested in the increase in productivity. The group's salt production during the spring cleaning last year increased by 108.99% compared to the previous year, exceeding the average output of the top-grade "tan" in the entire Huaibei Salt Field by 54.48%. The wage income of each long-term worker increased by 18.64% compared to the average wage of top-grade long-term workers in the entire field, and black salt was eliminated in terms of quality. Secondly, because the growth in labor productivity exceeded the growth in wages, and precise division of labor saved manpower, costs were reduced. Collective production also gradually overcame the feudal "tan ownership rights" ideology and technical conservatism among the salt workers, and cultivated a collective concept.
    The advanced collective production method of the Shi Baoyu group, after being summarized by the East China Salt Affairs Administration, was considered the budding of the development direction of Huaibei salt production from individual to collective and from decentralized to centralized. It has been vigorously promoted throughout the field, and new creations of the masses, such as scientific and reasonable work recording and wage grading, have been studied and absorbed in the promotion process, enriching and improving the original experience. The field also plans to improve the existing primitive and complex "tan" land structure into a scientific and centralized "tan" land structure in the next few years, step by step, to adapt to the characteristics of specialized and centralized operation in the new production method, and further change the face of production at the Huaibei Salt Field.

    淮北盐场时宝玉小组首创集体生产方式
    苏北国营淮北盐场时宝玉小组，首创先进的集体生产方式。这一生产方式发挥了生产的潜在能力，成为改变淮北盐场生产面貌的一个重要开端，目前该场在普遍推广中。
    淮北盐场的生产，沿袭着一套旧的生产制度：采用以滩（滩是盐场的基本生产资料，包括蓄水池、蒸发池、结晶池、卤塘等）为生产单位，以家庭劳动为主体的包工制。各滩劳动力的配备极不合理，劳动定额不精确。整个生产过程中的车水、盘水、种盐、刳盐等各项操作，没有较专一的分工，因此技术也不容易提高。盐产量的高低，主要决定于滩地的大小、好坏和设备的优劣，所以不宜于实行按件计工的工资制度。这些就大大妨碍了生产力的提高，因此，近年来淮盐产量虽逐年增加而质量却并未提高，成本也未降低。时宝玉小组的办法，就是针对这些缺点提出来的。
    时宝玉是个共产党员。去年该场进行春扫爱国主义增产竞赛时，他领导全圩（每条圩四份至八份滩）盐工研究如何以新的创造来争取超产，提出了集体生产的办法。他首先放弃自己好滩地产量高的利益，团结了圩内先进盐工，针对盐工中落后的“滩窝权”（滩地私有权）私有思想，进行了滩地公有、多劳多得的思想教育，成立了全场第一个集体生产小组。集体生产小组是以圩为生产单位，生产资料公有公用，劳动力统一调配，精密分工，实行生产组长负责制，使劳动力得到合理使用，各尽所长，并节省了人力，如过去每份滩要两人专门负责管风车和堆盐，现在全组四份滩只要两人就够了。工资方面，采取按劳取酬的分配原则，近似工厂内的车间包工小组。为了保证集体生产的顺利进行，该组并订立了各项制度，如作息制度、检查制度、评议工资制度等，共同遵守。
    集体生产的优越性，首先表现在生产率的提高上。该组去年春扫产盐量较前年增加了百分之一百零八点九九，超过全淮北盐场头等滩平均产量百分之五十四点四八，每一长工工资收入较全场头等长工平均工资增加百分之十八点六四，质量方面消灭了黑盐。其次，因为劳动生产率的增长超过了工资的增长，精密分工又节省了人力，因而降低了成本。集体生产，也逐渐克服了盐工中的封建的“滩窝权”思想和技术上的保守思想，培养了集体观念。
    时宝玉小组先进的集体生产方式，经华东盐务管理局总结后，认为是淮北盐业生产由个体到集体、由分散到集中的发展方向的萌芽，已在全场大力推广，并在推广过程中研究和吸收了群众的新创造，如科学合理的记工评工资等级等，充实和提高了原有经验。该场并计划在今后几年中，有步骤地将现有原始的复杂的滩地结构改进为科学集中的滩地结构，以适应新的生产方式中操作专一集中的特点，进一步改变淮北盐场的生产面貌。（新华社）
