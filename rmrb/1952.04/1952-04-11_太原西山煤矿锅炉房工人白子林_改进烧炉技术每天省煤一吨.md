To the Editor:

    Bai Zilin, a worker at the boiler room of the Xishan Coal Mine in Taiyuan, improved furnace burning technology during the "Three-Anti" movement, saving one ton of coal per day. This improvement is achieved in three aspects:

    (1) Pay attention to adding coal. When adding coal, observe the fire color. Add more coal where the light is white, less where the light is red, and none where the light is black, to fully utilize the heat value of the coal. Also, add coal frequently, increasing the number of times water is added per hour from two to four. This ensures a continuous supply of steam and prevents the steam pressure from dropping.

    (2) Improve the wind damper. In the past, workers did not pay attention to air leaks in the boiler, resulting in weak draft. Now, he blocks the air leak holes in the wind damper, greatly strengthening the draft and improving combustion.

    (3) Speed up the cleaning of ash. He reduces the time for cleaning ash from six minutes to four minutes each time, allowing for smooth airflow and aiding combustion.

    These improvements are excellent. I suggest that boiler room workers in factories and mines across the country adopt and try them out. This is also a method of conservation.

    改进烧炉技术每天省煤一吨
    编辑同志：我们太原西山煤矿锅炉房工人白子林，在“三反”运动中改进烧炉技术，每天可省煤一吨。这是从三方面改进的：
    （一）注意添煤。在添煤时要看火色，发白光处    多添，发红光处少添，发黑光处不添，使煤的发热量得到充分发挥。同时要勤添煤；每小时上水次数从二次增加到四次。这就可以源源不断地供给蒸汽，不使汽压下降。
    （二）改进风闸板。过去工人不注意锅炉跑风，致抽风力不强，现在他把风闸板的跑风孔堵住，因而大大加强了抽风力，燃烧良好。
    （三）加速清理炉灰。他把清理炉灰的时间从每次六分钟缩短到四分钟，使空气畅通，帮助燃烧。
    这些改进办法很好，我建议各地厂、矿的锅炉房工人采纳试用，这也是节约方法之一。
