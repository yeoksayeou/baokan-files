The Chinese edition of the Cominform newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 134, has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "The National Liberation Movement of the People of Colonial and Dependent Countries," and also includes articles such as "The Struggle of German Patriots for German Unity and All-German Elections" by Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, "The Militarization of the Economy in Capitalist Countries Makes the Working People More Impoverished" by John Gollan, a member of the Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and "The Rising Swedish Peace Movement" by C. H. Hermansson, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Sweden. In the news item titled "New Crimes of American Aggressors in Korea," this issue reports on the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialists against the Chinese and Korean people and the unanimous condemnation by progressive people of all countries. This issue also reports on the unfolding of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in our country in the "In the People's Republic of China" news column.

In his article, Ulbricht pointed out: The German people are waging a resolute struggle to win a unified Germany and conclude a peace treaty. The German people now realize that there is only one path to achieving the unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. This is the peaceful path of mutual understanding among the German people, a path leading to all-German elections and, through elections, to the signing of a peace treaty. The means to achieve this goal have already been clearly stated in the declaration issued by the government of the German Democratic Republic last September. Based on the government's proposal, the People's Chamber suggested to the West German Federal Council that an all-German conference be held to determine the date for all-German elections and to establish a National Assembly, as well as to expedite the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. The government of the German Democratic Republic also established a committee in November of last year to draft an electoral law for the free election of a German National Assembly. However, all these proposals were rejected by the Adenauer government in West Germany. In order to divert attention and deceive the patriotic people of West Germany, Adenauer submitted a false draft of "all-German elections" to the West German Parliament in early February of this year. In reality, Adenauer opposes all-German elections and hopes to launch a fratricidal struggle and a new world war through conscription laws. Ulbricht emphasized: However, all German patriots are beginning to realize this danger. A storm of anger against the policies of the shameless West German puppet government is sweeping the country. The German people's struggle for German unity has entered a new stage.

Gollan's article states: For the broad masses of the people in capitalist countries, the arms expansion movement has increased taxes and further reduced the already insufficient social welfare programs, intensifying exploitation. This plan further increases the absolute and relative poverty of the working people and reduces the amount of consumer goods purchased by the masses. For example, according to British government statistics, from October 1947 to mid-October 1951, real wages in Britain had fallen by 5 to 7 percent and continued to decline. Between October 1947 and April 1951, the cost of living in Britain rose by 29 percent. In the United States, taxes are now one-third higher than before the Korean War. Nearly six million people are receiving subsidies, and many fully unemployed and semi-unemployed people are not even included; at least 10.5 million American families are living a life barely able to make ends meet. Gollan emphasized: The working people of capitalist countries are waging a tenacious struggle against the militarization policies and impoverishment policies of the rulers of these countries. This is clearly evident in the powerful wave of strikes in Italy, the rising strike movements in France, the United States, and other countries, and the movement in Australia demanding wage increases.

Hermansson's article states: The Swedish people, like the people of all other countries, yearn for a peaceful life. However, a considerable portion of the Swedish people are still influenced by the continuous propaganda of newspapers, radio stations, and movies that follow the dictates of the United States. However, many events that have occurred in the past year have made many people in Sweden acutely aware of the need to actively fight for peace and national independence. The broad masses of the people have gradually linked the struggle against high prices, increased taxes, and the pursuit of improved living standards with the struggle against the arms expansion movement and the policy of preparing for war. Swedish public opinion has gradually understood that the policies of American imperialists are the main root cause of international tensions, the threat of war, and economic difficulties. Swedish capitalists are also vehemently opposed to the United States' lowering of goods prices and do not want to obey the United States' order to completely stop shipping important exports to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. At the recent United Nations General Assembly, the Swedish delegation opposed the United States on several issues. All of this is the result of the increasingly resolute resistance of the broad masses of the Swedish people to the United States' war and blackmail policies. Hermansson then pointed out: The Swedish National Peace Committee has recently issued a declaration to peace-loving people, calling on them to actively participate in the struggle to prevent peace and Sweden's national independence from suffering serious danger. Communists must stand at the forefront of this struggle and gloriously fulfill their great task. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三四期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三四期已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“殖民地国家和附属国人民的民族解放运动”的社论，并刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会主席格罗提渥的“德国爱国者争取德国统一及全德选举的斗争”，英国共产党政治委员会委员高兰的“资本主义国家的经济的军事化使劳动人民更加贫困”，瑞典共产党政治局委员海尔曼逊的“高涨中的瑞典和平运动”等文章。本期在题为“美国侵略者在朝鲜的新罪行”的消息中，报道了美帝国主义者对中朝人民进行细菌战和各国进步人士一致声讨的情形。本期还在“在中华人民共和国”消息栏中，报道了我国“三反”和“五反”运动开展的情形。
    格罗提渥在文章中指出：德国人民正在进行坚决的斗争，以争取统一的德国及缔结和约。德国人民现在认识到：要达到波茨坦协定中所规定的统一的、爱好和平的、民主的德国，只有一条道路。这就是德国人民获得彼此谅解的和平道路，是导致全德选举、并通过选举导致签订和约的道路。达到这个目标的办法已经在德意志民主共和国政府去年九月所发表的宣言中明白地说明了。根据政府的建议，人民议会曾向西德联邦议会建议举行全德大会，以确定全德选举日期，成立国民议会；从速签订对德和约和撤退一切占领军。德意志民主共和国政府还在去年十一月，就成立一个委员会，来草拟自由选举德国国民议会的选举法草案。但是，这一切建议都遭到了西德阿登纳政府的拒绝。为了转移注意力和欺骗西德的爱国志士，阿登纳在今年二月初向西德议会提出了一项虚伪的“全德选举”草案。实际上阿登纳是反对全德选举的，他希望通过征兵法来发动自相残杀的斗争和新世界大战。格罗提渥强调说：但是，德国全体爱国志士都开始体会到了这个危险。反对无耻的西德傀儡政府的政策的愤怒风暴正席卷全国。德国人民争取德国统一的斗争进入了新的阶段。
    高兰的文章说：对资本主义国家的广大人民群众来说，扩张军备运动已使赋税增加，并使原来已经不够的社会福利事业更加减少，剥削变本加厉。这个计划使劳动人民的绝对贫困程度和相对贫困程度更为增加，群众购买消费品的数量减少。例如根据英国政府的统计，从一九四七年到一九五一年十月中，英国的实际工资已下降了百分之五到七，而且还在继续下降。在一九四七年十月到一九五一年四月间，英国生活费用上涨了百分之二十九。在美国，现在的赋税比朝鲜战争以前增加了三分之一。领补助金的人差不多六百万人，许多完全失业和半失业的人根本还没有包括在内；至少有一千零五十万个美国家庭过着仅能餬口的生活。高兰强调说：资本主义国家的劳动人民正在对这些国家的统治者的军事化政策和使群众贫困的政策，进行顽强的斗争。这从意大利的有力的罢工浪潮，法国、美国及其他国家的罢工运动的高涨，以及澳大利亚要求增加工资的运动中，都可以明显地看出来。
    海尔曼逊在文章中说：瑞典人民和所有其他国家的人民一样渴望过和平的生活。但相当大一部分的瑞典人民仍然受到唯美国之命是从的报纸、电台和电影的不断宣传的影响。可是，过去一年中发生的许多事件，已使瑞典的许多人都痛感到有积极为和平与民族独立而斗争的必要。广大的人民群众已逐渐把反对物价高涨、反对捐税加重以及争取生活水准提高的斗争，与反对扩军运动及准备战争政策的斗争联系起来。瑞典舆论界已逐渐明白美帝国主义者的政策是国际局势紧张、战争威胁及经济困难的主要根源。瑞典资本家也激怒地反对美国减低货物的价格，不想服从美国关于完全停止把重要出口货运往苏联和人民民主国家的命令。在最近的联合国大会上，瑞典代表团在若干问题上都反对美国。这一切都是瑞典广大群众愈益坚决地抵抗美国的战争与讹诈政策的结果。海尔曼逊接着指出：瑞典全国和平委员会最近已向爱好和平的人们发表宣言，号召他们积极参加斗争，以免和平和瑞典的民族独立遭受到严重的危险。共产党人必须站在这个斗争的前列，光荣地执行他们的伟大任务。（新华社）
