    Reviewing My Past Teaching Attitude
    Ding Xuhuai, Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, Nankai University

    I studied at Tsinghua School (formerly a preparatory school for studying in the United States, the predecessor of Tsinghua University) for seven years, followed by six years in the United States. The education I received during these thirteen years was entirely American-style education. This long-term American bourgeois education had a profound and significant impact on my thinking. It brought me some wrong views on education and science and technology, the main ones being the "purely technical viewpoint" and the "general education viewpoint," which separate politics from science and technology.

    Through this teacher ideological remolding study movement, I have examined that my guiding ideology is the extremely selfish individualism of seeking fame and fortune (especially fame). Starting from this guiding ideology, combined with the above-mentioned wrong views on education and science and technology, my past attitude and behavior in teaching have naturally been extremely incorrect, seriously violating the interests of the people, and are worthy of my deep review.

    Teaching Attitude of "Purely Technical Viewpoint"

    I have been teaching for nearly twenty years, and I have always considered myself to be very "serious and responsible" and wanted to teach students "well," and as a result, I have received the respect and love of students to a greater or lesser extent, which I am quite proud of. Now, upon examination, what is the standard of "good" that I want to teach students "well," and what is the purpose? I want to teach students well, verbally saying it is to "fulfill my responsibility" and to "cultivate talents," but in my heart, I want to establish and maintain my own reputation, and want to be among the ranks of famous professors and scholars. The purpose is still for my personal fame. Looking at what the standard of "good" is? Undoubtedly, the "good" in my mind is the "good" of the "purely technical viewpoint," which only focuses on the students' professional skills and ignores their political and moral cultivation. The so-called "purely technical viewpoint" here seems to be "above class and above politics" on the surface, but in reality? It is equivalent to not letting students be concerned about politics, which has the effect of weakening the revolutionary forces. What is this stance? At the same time, because I myself have a strong pro-American thought, it will inevitably give students the influence of worshiping the United States. Using this standard to teach, the result will inevitably be the adoption of rote learning of foreign dogmas and "cramming" teaching methods, the teaching content will inevitably be unrealistic, but will promote American culture and instill pro-American thought. What kind of people will be cultivated under this so-called "purely technical viewpoint" teaching attitude? Through this ideological examination, I have deeply realized that the students I have taught, at best, are just like me, extremely selfish, pursuing fame and fortune, completely planning for themselves, worshiping the "science and technology" and "material civilization" of American imperialism, unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and have no concept of seeking happiness for the masses and serving the people at all; at worst, they may have joined the reactionary group, turned to imperialism, colluded with the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and committed heinous crimes against the revolution and the people; some have become traitors or spies for traitors (there are concrete examples in this "Three-Anti" movement). Thinking of this, I am really shuddering and full of regret! I have always thought that I have taught for so many years and cultivated many talents, and I have made some contributions. Little did I know that many of the talents I have helped to cultivate only have technology but lack political awareness and moral concepts. What contribution can such talents, who cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and have no people's stand, make to the country and the people? I should deny my so-called contribution. I must realize the great losses and harms suffered by the people due to my past "purely technical viewpoint" teaching attitude, recognize my serious sin, and be determined to correct my teaching attitude from now on in order to atone for my past mistakes.

    Even if I take a step back and only talk about my intention to teach students well from the "purely technical viewpoint," have I really been serious and responsible and made the greatest efforts? No. My so-called seriousness and responsibility is just trying to explain the books more clearly, give more and stricter exams, set higher grade standards, and not be lenient to students who fail, and so on. Of course, these are not bad things, but the problem is that my performance in these teaching aspects ultimately stems from individualism and is intended to maintain and enhance my personal reputation. Therefore, as long as my reputation is maintained and enhanced, the goal has been achieved, the wish has been fulfilled, and other things can be ignored. I do not care about the students' learning situation, whether they understand the materials taught, whether they can digest them, what their activities are outside of their studies, and what their health is like. For students with poor grades, I do not try to understand their difficulties, and I do not think of ways to help them more. I am just holding the view of being hired, and I think everything is fine after I finish teaching, and finally I eliminate the students who I subjectively think are "not promising" by giving them failing grades, and I even think that giving more failing grades is enough to show my "seriousness" and "strictness." I have never reflected on whose responsibility should be borne for students' failing grades. I have never thought that it takes so much hard-earned money from the working people to cultivate a talent, and I should try my best to cultivate as many as possible, even if his professional level is not high, he can still play a good role to a certain extent.

    Due to the long-term influence of the reactionary educational ideas of American imperialism, I have always believed that scientific and technological research is borderless, and I feel that "science for science's sake" is right.

    After liberation, after learning, I only began to theoretically realize what the purpose of scientific research is. Recently, the bacteriological warfare crimes of American imperialism have aroused my incomparable anger and also given me an extremely profound lesson, shattering my dream of transnationality in scientific research. Can there be a clearer example than this? The same science and technology, if it is in the hands of a new democratic or socialist country, in the hands of the proletariat, it can be used to defend world peace and to seek happiness for the people. If it is in the hands of American imperialism, it can be used to massacre the people instead.

    Perfunctory Attitude Towards Curriculum Reform - "General Education Thought" at Work

    I used to be in favor of "general education." In the initial period after liberation, when discussing the issue of curriculum specialization, I still advocated that specialized training should not be implemented in regular universities, and general training should be implemented; if there is a need for specialized training, it may be attached to the university with specialized courses or set up specialized schools separately. Due to the effect of my "general education thought," I did not pay attention to the spirit of curriculum reform, I was perfunctory in simplifying the curriculum, in name only, and I did not strictly abide by the credit hour system.

    Why did I favor "general education" over specialized education in the past? This is inseparable from my individualistic guiding ideology. Because the set of technology I learned from the United States is general training. If I want to specialize, I cannot specialize, or at least it takes a lot of effort to specialize. Specialization will hinder my personal interests, so I do not agree.

    Through this ideological examination, I have only solved the problem of general training and specialized training from the essence of social economy. I realize that the social and economic system of American imperialism is the economic system of capitalist society, and there is no need for specialized education at all. In order to be able to exploit mental labor, capitalists welcome and encourage general training. In this way, he can choose talents from the large group of people who have received general training with relatively low salaries, who are unwilling but have to be exploited and driven by him. Conversely, under the cruel competition, many intellectuals have to choose "general education" in order to cater to the tastes of capitalists in order to get a job. In this way, there can be more job opportunities. If they have received specialized education, their adaptability to work is very small, which will cause the pain of unemployment upon graduation. From this point of view, "general education" is an inevitable phenomenon in the economic system of capitalist society. As for our new China, its economic system is a planned economy, and everything must be coordinated with the needs of the country and the people. Individual work plans and positions must be arranged in the overall economic construction plan of the collective, and must not be divorced from it, so what is needed is specialized education and professional training. My past advocacy of "general education" still started from individualism and did not focus on the needs of the country's economic construction, so taking a perfunctory attitude towards curriculum reform is extremely wrong. If it is not corrected in time, it will inevitably fail to fulfill the important task of cultivating a large number of talents for the motherland in order to meet the upcoming upsurge of economic construction. The seriousness of its harm is very obvious.

    This teacher ideological remolding movement is nothing less than a wake-up call to me, a blow to the head, making me realize the serious errors of my past teaching attitude dominated by the decadent and reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the great losses and harms it has brought to the people, enabling me to be determined to correct my teaching attitude in the future, under the ideological leadership of the working class, to be a people's teacher in name and in fact, and to cultivate a large number of economic construction talents for the motherland who have both ability and moral integrity, are healthy in body and mind, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    检讨我过去的教学态度
    南开大学化工系教授  丁绪淮
    我在清华学校（以前留美预备学校，是清华大学的前身）读了七年书，跟着又在美国读了六年。这十三年中我所受到的教育是完全美国式的教育。这种长期的美国式的资产阶级教育，在我思想上所发生的影响，是既深且巨的。它带给我一些对教育对科学技术的错误看法，其中主要的有政治与科学技术脱节的“单纯技术观点”和“通才教育观点”。
    经过这次的教师思想改造学习运动，我检查出我的主导思想是个人主义的极端自私的名利（尤其是名）思想。从这种主导思想出发，结合着上面所说的对教育及科学技术的错误观点，我过去在教学方面所抱的态度和所表现的行为，自然而然地都是极其不正确的，严重地违反人民利益的，是值得我深刻检讨的。
    “单纯技术观点”的教学态度
    我教书将近二十年，一向自以为是很“认真负责”想把学生教“好”的，也因此或多或少地受到了学生们的敬爱，自己颇引以为慰。现在检查起来，我之所谓想把学生教“好”，这“好”的标准是什么，目的又是为了什么？我要把学生教好，口头说是为了“尽我的责任”，是为了“造就人才”，心里却是想建立及维持自己的名望，想侧身于名教授学者之列。目的依然是为了我个人的名。再看“好”的标准究竟是怎样呢？无疑地，我心目中的“好”，是“单纯技术观点”的“好”，是只注重学生们的业务而忽略他们的政治、道德修养的。这里所谓“单纯技术观点”，表面看来，好像是“超阶级超政治”的，实际上呢？则等于不让同学们过问政治，起了削弱革命力量的作用。这是什么立场呢？同时由于我本身有着浓厚的崇美思想，因此也就必然会给同学们以崇拜美国的影响。用这种标准去教书，其结果必然是采用搬弄洋教条和“填鸭”式的教授法，教学内容必然是不切合实际的，而是宣扬了美国的文化，灌输了崇美的思想。在这种所谓“单纯技术观点”的教学态度下，所造就出的人才会是些什么样子呢？经过这次的思想检查，我深深地认识到我所教出来的学生，上焉者也不过是和我一样，极端自私，追求名利，完全为个人打算，崇拜美帝国主义的“科学技术”和“物质文明”，敌我不分，丝毫没有为群众谋幸福为人民服务的观念；下焉者就可能加入了反动集团，投靠帝国主义，勾结官僚资产阶级，做了反革命反人民的滔天罪行；有的当了奸商或奸商的坐探（在这次“三反”运动中就有具体的事例）。想到这里，我真是不寒而栗，悔恨万分！我一向自以为教了这许多年的书，造就出不少的人才，多少也有些功劳。殊不知我所帮助造就出的人才，很多人不过是只具有技术而很欠缺政治认识和道德观念。这样的人才，敌我不分，没有人民立场，对国家和人民会有什么贡献呢？我应该否定我自己所谓的功劳了。我必须认识到由于我过去的“单纯技术观点”的教学态度，人民所遭受到的莫大损失和危害，认识到我这一项严重的罪过，下定决心，从今起端正我的教学态度，以赎前愆。
    即使退一步，只就我用“单纯技术观点”要把学生教好这一点而言，我果真是认真负责尽了最大的努力吗？不是的。我所谓的认真负责，只是设法把书讲解得清楚些，考试多些严些，成绩标准高些，对于不及格的学生概不通融，等等。当然，这些并不是坏事，问题是在于我的这些教学上的表现，归根到底依然是从个人主义出发的，是想要维持以及提高我个人的声誉的。因此，只要我的声誉维持了、提高了，目的便已达到，愿望便已满足，其他就都可以不去过问了。我不去过问学生们的学习情况，讲授的材料是否懂得，能否消化，业务以外的活动怎样，健康如何。对于成绩不好的学生，我不去了解他们的困难，不想法去多帮助他们。我就是这样地抱着雇佣观点，教完书就算万事大吉，最后拿不及格来淘汰掉我主观上认为是“不可造就”的学生，还以为多给不及格正足以表示我的“认真”和“严格”。我未曾自省过，学生的成绩不及格，其责任应该谁负。我未曾想到，百年树人，造就一个人才要耗费多少劳动人民的血汗钱，我应当尽力多培植一个是一个，纵使他的业务水平不高，他仍然是可以发挥一定程度的好作用的。
    由于长期地受了美帝国主义的反动教育思想的影响，我一向认为研究科学技术是无国界的，我觉得“为科学而科学”才是对的。
    解放后经过学习，才起始在理论上认识到研究科学的目的是为了什么。最近美帝国主义的细菌战罪行，引起了我无比的愤怒，也活生生地给予我一个极其深刻的教训，打碎了我研究科学的超国家的迷梦。还能比这个例子更明显吗？同样的科学技术，若是掌握在新民主主义或社会主义国家的手中，掌握在无产阶级的手中，就可以用来保卫世界和平，用来为人民谋幸福。若是掌握在美帝国主义的手中，就反而可以用来屠杀人民。
    对课程改革敷衍了事——“通才教育思想”在作祟
    我过去是赞成“通才教育”的。解放以后的最初一段时期，在讨论课程专业化的问题时，我仍旧主张在正规大学里不应该实行专才训练，应该实行通才训练；倘若有专才训练的必要，不妨在大学里附设专修科或另外设立专科学校。由于我的“通才教育思想”在作祟，我对课程改革的精神就不重视，对课程精简就敷衍了事，有名无实，对学时制度也就不严格地遵守。
    我过去何以赞成“通才教育”而不赞成专才教育呢？这是和我的个人主义的主导思想分不开的。因为我从美国学来的那一套技术就是通才训练。若要专业化，我专不起来，至少也需费很多工夫才专得起来。专业化会妨碍我个人的利益，所以我不赞成。
    经过这次的思想检查，我才从社会经济的本质上解决了通才训练和专才训练的问题。我认识到美帝国主义的社会经济体系是资本主义社会的经济体系，根本不需要专才教育。资本家为了能够剥削脑力劳动，是欢迎而且鼓励通才训练的。这样，他可以在广大的受了通才训练的人群中，以比较低廉的薪资，选择虽不甘心但不得不被他剥削、由他驱使的人才。反过来，众多的知识分子，在残酷的竞争之下，为了能迎合资本家的胃口以便谋得工作，也就不得不选择“通才教育”。这样，谋工作的机会可以比较多些。若是受了专才教育，对工作的适应性反而很小，更会造成毕业即失业的痛苦。由此看来，“通才教育”是资本主义社会经济体系里的必然现象。至于在我们新中国的社会里，其经济体系是计划经济，处处必须配合国家和人民的需要。个人的工作计划和岗位必须安排在集体的全盘的经济建设计划之中，万万不能脱节，所以需要的是专才教育，专业训练。我过去主张“通才教育”，仍然是从个人主义出发，未从国家的经济建设需要着眼，因而对课程改革采取敷衍态度，是极端错误的。若不及时纠正，必然不能负起为祖国培养大量人才以便迎接行将到来的经济建设高潮的重大任务。其危害性之严重，是很明显的。
    这次教师的思想改造运动对于我不啻是一声醒世警钟，当头棒喝，使我认识到我过去由资产阶级的腐朽和反动思想所支配的教学态度的严重错误以及它所带给人民的莫大损失和危害，使我能下定决心要端正我今后的教学态度，在工人阶级的思想领导之下，作一个名符其实的人民教师，为祖国培养大批德才兼备体魄健全，全心全意为人民服务的经济建设人才。
