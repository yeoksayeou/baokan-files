[Xinhua News Agency News] Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: French colonialists have recently further implemented a frantic and bloody suppression of the Tunisian people's national liberation movement, arousing unparalleled anger among the people of Tunisia. Currently, the Tunisian people's struggle for national liberation is developing in depth.

Since mid-January, French colonialists have not only continued to arrest patriotic people, massacre them, and close down the Tunisian Communist Party's and other progressive publications, but also prevented Tunisian representatives from going to New York to accuse the French colonialists' atrocities to the United Nations Security Council. Recently, French colonialists have taken even more barbaric measures. On the evening of March 25th, the French Resident-General in Tunisia, de Hauteclocque, suddenly ordered the arrest of the Tunisian government's Prime Minister Chenik and three other ministers, and exiled them to the remote south, simply because this government sympathized with the Tunisian people's movement for independence. At the same time, many leaders of the Communist Party and national independence movement were also exiled. The police occupied the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party. The French colonialists also announced that martial law would be implemented throughout Tunisia from March 26th, and all men between the ages of eighteen and sixty would be forcibly incorporated into "security teams," arresting more than 500 Tunisian patriots on the 26th alone. On March 28th, de Hauteclocque and the French President's special envoy forced the King of Tunisia to appoint France's loyal lackey, former Prime Minister Baccouche, as Prime Minister to form a pro-French government.

For a long time, the constantly rising Tunisian national independence movement has made American imperialism deeply uneasy. Washington has demanded that decisive measures be taken to strangle the Tunisian national liberation movement and ensure American military bases.

The brutal actions of the French colonialists have further aroused the more heroic resistance of the Tunisian people. On the morning of the 26th, strikes and market boycotts occurred in various parts of Tunisia. The Tunisian Workers' Union and the Tunisian General Labour Union called on workers to rise up and resist the atrocities of the French colonial authorities. On the 27th, a general strike broke out. In the capital Tunis, Sfax, and many other places, all industries came to a standstill, shops were closed, and many transportation workers and government employees also joined the struggle. By the 29th, the general strike was still continuing. Groups of angry Tunisians, disregarding the strict guard of heavily armed troops, constantly rushed to the vicinity of the Royal Palace and the Prime Minister's Office of the "new Prime Minister" to demonstrate against the appointment of Baccouche. On the 30th, the Tunisian General Labour Union issued a public statement, calling on workers to hold another general strike on April 1st.

Many countries are deeply angered by the barbaric measures taken by the French colonialists. The French Communist Party issued a protest letter, denouncing the Pinay government for adopting a policy of suppression against the Tunisian people, and "calling on all workers to help the just struggle of the Tunisian patriots with concrete actions." Iraqi newspapers condemned the French government's actions in Tunisia as "the most aggressive, most unfriendly, and worst typical imperialist action taken against the Arab world." Indian newspapers also condemned the actions of the French authorities in Tunisia. The "Delhi Express" said: "The French have not learned any lessons in Indochina. The result of France's plundering in Tunisia will inevitably be the complete failure of their plans." In view of the strong emotions of the people throughout the country, the Pakistani government has instructed its representative to the United Nations Security Council to request the Security Council to discuss the Tunisian issue.

    美法帝国主义者横暴迫害突尼斯民族解放运动
    突尼斯各地人民展开大规模罢工和示威
    法共和伊拉克等国进步报纸猛烈谴责法国殖民者的暴行 【本报讯】综合新华社消息：法国殖民者最近对突尼斯人民的民族解放运动进一步实行了疯狂的血腥镇压，激起突尼斯全国人民无比的愤怒。目前突尼斯人民争取民族解放的斗争，正在深入发展。
    从一月中旬以来，法国殖民者不仅继续逮捕爱国人民，向他们进行屠杀，封闭了突尼斯共产党的和其他进步的刊物，并且阻止突尼斯代表去纽约向联合国安全理事会控诉法国殖民者的暴行。最近，法国殖民者更采取了野蛮措施，三月二十五日晚，法国驻突尼斯总督德奥特喀洛克突然下令逮捕了突尼斯政府的首相谢尼克和另外三个大臣，并把他们放逐到僻远的南方，这仅是因为这个政府同情突尼斯人民争取独立运动。同时许多共产党及民族独立运动的领袖也都被放逐。警察占领了突尼斯共产党中央委员会的会址。法国殖民者并宣布：从三月二十六日起突尼斯全境实施戒严，把十八岁到六十岁的男子一律强制编入“保安队”，仅在二十六日一天就逮捕了突尼斯爱国者五百多人。三月二十八日，德奥特喀洛克和法国总统的专使强迫突尼斯国王任命了法国的忠实走卒、前首相巴库士为首相，组织亲法政府。
    许久以来，不断高涨的突尼斯民族独立运动已使得美帝国主义深感不安，华盛顿要求以断然措施来扼杀突尼斯民族解放运动，确保美国的军事基地。
    法国殖民者的残暴举动已经进一步激起了突尼斯人民更加英勇的反抗。二十六日清晨突尼斯各地就发生了罢工和罢市。突尼斯工人工会和突尼斯工会联合会号召工人起来反抗法国殖民当局的暴行。二十七日爆发了总罢工，在首都突尼斯市、斯法克斯及其他许多地方，一切行业都陷于停顿，商店店门紧闭，许多交通工人和政府雇员也参加了斗争。到二十九日，总罢工仍在继续。成群结队的愤怒的突尼斯人不顾全副武装的大批军队的森严戒备，不断冲到王宫附近和“新首相”的首相府前举行示威，抗议巴库士的任命。三十日，突尼斯工会联合会发表公报，号召工人们在四月一日再度举行总罢工。
    许多国家对于法国殖民者所采取的野蛮手段，都深为愤怒。法国共产党发出抗议书，痛斥比内政府对突尼斯人民采取镇压政策，并“号召所有工人用具体行动来帮助突尼斯爱国者的正义斗争”。伊拉克的报纸谴责法国政府在突尼斯的行动是“对阿拉伯世界所采取的最具有侵略性的、最不友好的、最坏的帝国主义的典型行动”。印度报纸也谴责法国当局在突尼斯的行动。“德里快报”说：“法国人还没有在印度支那获得任何教训。法国在突尼斯掠夺的结果必然是他们的计划的全盘失败。”巴基斯坦的政府鉴于全国人民的强烈情绪，已经训令它驻联合国安全理事会的代表，要求安全理事会讨论突尼斯问题。
