"The red flag waves atop the sky, Chairman Mao's radiance shines in all directions, driving away dark clouds to reveal a clear sky, turning the Gobi Desert into fertile fields... … …"

In the rural areas of southern Xinjiang after rent reduction and anti-hegemony campaigns, songs praising Chairman Mao resonate everywhere. Uyghur farmers, with the utmost respect, deeply yearn for Chairman Mao. For many years, the Uyghur people have suffered the barbaric exploitation and plunder of the landlord class, leaving the vast rural areas of southern Xinjiang in unimaginable poverty. Farmers wore clothes riddled with holes, relying entirely on mulberries, oleaster fruits, apricots, and peaches for two to six months out of the year. Some farmers' homes contained nothing but a gourd for carrying water, wooden spoons and plates for eating, and a tattered felt for sleeping. After the liberation of Xinjiang Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, people of all ethnic groups ended their tragic fate. Especially after the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement last winter and this spring, the countryside has taken on a completely new look. The Uyghur farmers are reborn. The farmers described their past and present like this: In the past, farmers transformed the Gobi Desert into fertile fields with their own hands, but they still did not own an inch of land. Farmers planted wheat, rice, and corn, but what they received was wheat straw, rice bran, and corn stalks. Farmers built canals, but they could not irrigate their fields because the water was monopolized and sold by the landlords. The apricots on the apricot trees in the farmers' orchards dried up before they could ripen, and the peaches on the peach trees did the same. When the fruit trees died, they became firewood for the landlords to cook mutton and pilaf. Farmers planted wheat and rice for the landlords, but they received only the landlords' fists and clubs. Landlords never planted wheat or rice, but they ate white flour and rice year-round. Now, all the farmers, stretching out their hands from the same sleeve and speaking from the same voice, are united as one. With their own hands, they shattered the shackles that the landlords had placed around the farmers' necks for thousands of years, and they overthrew the mountains that the landlords had been pressing down on them. The Uyghur farmers have stood up, under the red flag of Chairman Mao, overthrowing the bullies, reducing rent from the landlords and rich peasants, and reclaiming the property they had seized and the wages for uncompensated labor. They will never be oppressed again. In the past, landlords called the farmers "lice on their feet." Now, the farmers have become the masters of the countryside. The joyful voices of the farmers echo in every village after rent reduction and the fight against the local bullies. The morning after the anti-local bully rally in the fourth district and fourth township of Shache County, the farmers wrote these two short poems: "Walls are stacked on walls to block the wind; we trample on the local bullies so that poor farmers can enjoy happiness"; "White sorghum sways in the wind, red sorghum sways in the wind; the local bullies who used to oppress us are howling like bitches." From these two short poems, we can clearly see that the power of the landlords and bullies has been completely swept away. The farmers said joyfully: "Now we eat corn as if we are eating rock candy, we eat millet as if we are eating granulated sugar, we wear homespun cloth as if we are wearing silk, and even the tea we drink is red. In the past, our bodies were tightly confined by four walls, and we could not stretch our hands and feet. Now, we are like fish in a large river, swimming freely."

Why has the dark and miserable countryside of thousands of years been completely transformed in just two short years? Why have the farmers, who were once slandered as "lice on their feet" by the landlords, become the masters of the countryside in one leap? Every farmer deeply understands this reason. As Aymel, the director of the farmers' association in the fourth district and fourth township of Shache County, said at the celebration meeting for the victory of rent reduction and anti-hegemony: "All this is because of Chairman Mao's leadership. Chairman Mao has rescued us suffering people. Chairman Mao loves the Han people, and he also loves the Uyghur people. Chairman Mao led us to fight against the landlords and bullies." Therefore, farmers in various parts of southern Xinjiang have written many poems to praise their beloved leader. These poems are filled with respect, love, gratitude, longing, and blessings for Chairman Mao.

On the morning of the distribution of the fruits of struggle in the fourth district and fourth township of Shache County, the farmers blew short flutes, beat hand drums, sang songs, danced, and flocked to the meeting place. The women dressed themselves as if for a holiday, and all the men and women, young and old, in the village were in a frenzy. At dusk, the peasant women, wearing the colorful clothes they had just received, all looked young and beautiful. The farmers led cattle and donkeys, carried hoes and sickles, held quilts and felts, and carried grain and large pots, with laughter rising and falling, falling and rising again. Many farmers were moved to tears, and they pulled the cadres and said: "We pray for Chairman Mao day and night, wishing him good health and longevity." Tohuti received a large ox. He touched the horns for a while, touched the spine for a while, looked and looked again, and when he saw the Han cadre, he pointed to the ox and himself, indicating that the ox was his own. He said to the farmer who got a donkey: "In the past, when we couldn't survive, we prayed to God, but we were still in the mud. One foot was lifted a little, and the other foot sank in again. The deeper we sank, the deeper we sank, and we could never climb out. Now Chairman Mao has rescued us." When the farmers were taking their victory fruits home, they sang the songs they had written in unison:

"Play our dutar, beat our skin hand drum. Come on! Male and female farmers! We sing loudly: Thank you, savior Mao Zedong, leading us to turn ourselves over. Overthrowing bullies and reducing rent, farmers are the masters of their own houses. Uyghurs know kindness and do not forget those who built the canal while drinking water. We wish the leader Chairman Mao, good health and longevity." The song, along with the autumn evening wind, spread far away, merging with the songs of farmers far away thanking Chairman Mao. A farmer in Jiashi County had only three mu of orchard land, which was occupied by the landlord for six years. The family of four had nothing to eat or wear and lived a hard life. This time, when the rent reduction work team arrived in his village, he poured out all the bitterness that had been suppressed in his heart for a long time at the grievance meeting. He returned home and made these two lines of poetry: "People who buy fruits pick the red ones; people who suffer love Chairman Mao."

After rent reduction and anti-hegemony campaigns in some villages in Shufu County, farmers began to actively produce and work hard to learn culture. When the farmers carry baskets to collect manure, when the farmers carry literacy textbooks to the literacy class, they sing again and again: "The one who creates a new countryside, the one who makes our hearts happy, is you—the great leader Mao Zedong. You are the sun, you are the bright lamp, we will always follow you—the great leader Mao Zedong."

After the farmers' struggle against the landlords was victorious, they wanted to tell the news of this victory and their joyful mood to the person they respected most—Chairman Mao. The farmers said that in order to thank Chairman Mao, we really want to grow two wings and fly to Chairman Mao's face to salute Chairman Mao. In order to express this feeling, the farmers in the fourth district and fourth township of Shache County wrote these two poems: "White pigeons are dancing in the blue sky; the liberated people want to see Chairman Mao." "A pair of birds in the sky, stretch your wings down, please bring me a letter, bring it to our dear Chairman Mao."

The liberated farmers' longing for Chairman Mao is fully expressed in these two poems. The deep and sincere feelings of the people of Xinjiang for Chairman Mao prove the correctness of the various policies implemented by the Communist Party and the People's Government in Xinjiang over the past two years. Shadihan, an eighty-year-old woman in Shaya County, slept under Chairman Mao's portrait for three nights after the victory of rent reduction and anti-hegemony. She said: "With Chairman Mao with us, the night is as bright as the day."

    维吾尔族人民歌唱毛主席
    罗立韵
    “天上顶上红旗扬，毛主席光辉照四方，赶走乌云见晴天，戈壁沙漠变良田。……………………”
    减租反霸后的新疆南疆农村，到处响着颂扬毛主席的歌声。维吾尔族的农民怀着崇高的敬意殷切地想念着毛主席。多少年来，维吾尔族人民遭受着地主阶级的野蛮剥削和掠夺，广大的南疆农村贫困到使人难以想像的境地。农民们穿着千洞百孔的衣服，一年中有两三个月甚至半年的时间全靠桑子、沙枣、杏子、桃子度日。有些农民的家里，除了背水用的葫芦、吃饭用的木杓、木盘及睡觉用的一条破毡外，再无其他东西。新疆全省解放后，各族人民在共产党、毛主席的领导下，结束了悲惨的命运。尤其是经过去冬今春的减租反霸运动，农村的面貌焕然一新。维吾尔族的农民新生了。农民们这样形容他们的过去和现在：过去，农民用双手把戈壁沙漠变成了良田，但农民仍旧没有一角地，农民种了麦子、稻子和苞米，但农民得到的是麦草、稻糠和苞米秆。农民修了水渠，但农民却浇不上水，水被地主霸占和盗卖了。农民果园里杏树上的杏子旱成了杏干，桃树上的桃子旱成了桃干；果树枯死了，就成为地主煮羊肉做抓饭的木柴。农民给地主种了麦子和稻子，但吃的是地主的拳头和木棍；地主从来不种麦子和稻子，但一年四季吃的是白面和大米。现在，全体农民，一个袖筒里伸手，一个领口里出头，团结起来像一个人，用自己的双手，把几千年来地主套在农民脖子上的枷锁打得粉碎了，把地主压在农民身上的重重大山推翻了；维吾尔族的农民站起来了，在毛主席的红旗下，打倒了恶霸，向地主富农减了租，要回了霸占的财产和无偿劳役的工资，永世不再受欺压了。过去地主把农民称呼为“脚上的虱子”。现在农民成为农村的主人了。农民的欢声，洋溢在减租反恶霸后的每个农村。莎车县四区四乡反恶霸大会后的第二天早晨，农民写了这样两首小诗：“墙上叠墙，为了挡风，我们脚踩着恶霸，为了贫苦农民享福”；“白高粱迎风摆动，红高粱迎风摆动；过去压迫我们的恶霸，像母狗一样在叫唤了”。从这两首小诗里，我们亲切地看到地主恶霸的威风完全扫地了。农民喜悦地说：“现在我们吃苞米如吃冰糖，吃小米如吃沙糖，穿土布如穿绸缎，喝的茶也红了。过去我们的身子被四堵墙紧紧圈住，手脚不能伸展；现在像大河里的鱼，自由地游来游去。”
    几千年来黑暗悲惨的农村，为什么在短短两年中完全改变了面貌？一向被地主诬蔑为“脚上的虱子”的农民，为什么一跃而为农村的主人？这个道理，每个农民都深刻地懂得。正如莎车县四区四乡农会主任艾美尔在庆祝减租反霸胜利大会上所说的：“这一切都是因为有了毛主席的领导。毛主席救出了我们受苦受难的人。毛主席爱汉族人民，也爱维吾尔族人民。毛主席领导我们向地主恶霸进行了斗争。”因此，南疆各地农民编写了许多诗歌来颂扬自己爱戴的领袖。这些诗歌里充满了对毛主席的崇敬、热爱、感谢、想念和祝福。
    莎车县四区四乡分配斗争果实的那天早晨，农民们吹着短笛，敲着手鼓，唱着歌、跳着舞、涌向会场。妇女们像节日一样地打扮着自己，全村的男女老少都沸腾起来了。黄昏时，农妇们穿着刚分到的彩色衣服，个个都显得年青而美丽。农民们牵着牛和驴，扛着砍土镘和镰刀，抱着被子和毡子，背着粮食和大锅，一片欢笑声，起了又落，落了又起。不少农民感动得流下眼泪，拉着干部说：“我们日夜都为毛主席祈祷，祝福他身体健康万万岁。”托合的色一提分到一头大耕牛，他一会儿摸摸牛角，一会儿摸摸牛脊背，看了又看，瞅了又瞅，见了汉族干部，就指指牛和自己，表示这条牛是他自己的了。他对分到一头驴的农民说：“过去当我们活不下去的时候，就求告老天爷，可是我们还是在泥滩里。一只脚刚提起一点，另一只脚又陷进去了。越陷越深，永远爬不出来。现在毛主席把我们救出来了。”当农民们带着胜利果实回家的时候，不约而同地唱出了自己编写的歌子：
    “弹起我们的都塔尔，敲起我们的皮手鼓。来啊！男女农民们！我们高声歌唱：感谢救星毛泽东，领导咱们把身翻。斗倒恶霸又减租，农民当家作主人。维吾尔人知恩情，饮水不忘修渠人，遥祝领袖毛主席，身体健康万万岁。”歌声随着秋天的晚风，播送到远处，和远处农民感谢毛主席的歌声溶成一片。伽师县有一个农民只有三亩果园地，被地主霸占去了六年。全家四口无吃无穿，过着困苦的生活。这次减租工作队到了他所住的乡村，他在诉苦会上把久压在心中的苦水全部倒出来了。他回到家里做了这样两句诗：“买果子的人挑红的拿，受苦的人热爱毛主席。”
    疏附县的某些乡村经过减租反霸，农民们开始积极生产，努力学习文化。当农民们担着筐子拾粪的时候，当农民们挟着识字课本走向识字班的时候，他们和她们一次又一次地唱着：“创造新农村的，使我们心中高兴的，就是您啊——伟大的领袖毛泽东。您就是太阳，您就是明灯，我们永远跟着您啊——伟大的领袖毛泽东。”
    农民们对地主的斗争得到胜利以后，他们就想把这个胜利的消息和自己喜悦的心情告诉自己最敬爱的人——毛主席。农民们说，为了感谢毛主席，我们真想生出两只翅膀飞到毛主席的面前，给毛主席敬礼。莎车县四区四乡的农民为了表达这种感情，写了这样两首诗：“洁白的鸽群，在蓝色的高空飞舞；翻身的人儿，想见一见毛主席。”“天空一对鸟，你把翅膀往下伸，请你给我带封信，带给我们亲爱的毛主席。”
    翻身农民对毛主席的想念，从这两首诗中充分地表现出来了。新疆人民对毛主席的深厚真挚的感情，证明了两年多来共产党和人民政府在新疆所实施的各种政策的正确。沙雅县一个八十岁的老太太沙地汗在减租反霸胜利后，在毛主席的挂像下睡了三个晚上。她说：“有毛主席和我们在一起，晚上也和白天一样明亮。”
