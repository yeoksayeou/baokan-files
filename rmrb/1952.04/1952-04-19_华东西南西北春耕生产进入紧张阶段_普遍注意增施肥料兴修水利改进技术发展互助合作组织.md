Spring plowing production in East China has entered a tense stage. North of the Yangtze River, plowing and harrowing of spring fields are proceeding rapidly, with many areas having plowed and harrowed three or four times already, and are about to begin sowing. Rice areas in the Jianghuai and Jiangnan regions are also actively plowing fields and soaking seeds in preparation for sowing; in southern Fujian, early rice transplanting has become widespread in the double-cropping rice areas. Of the 115 million mu of wheat fields in the entire region, most have been weeded and top-dressed with fertilizer, and are generally growing well. Wheat harvesting has been completed in southern Fujian, and other areas of the province will also begin harvesting soon. In some areas of southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and Zhejiang, where wheat and other crops were flooded due to excessive spring rainfall, farmers are vigorously digging ditches for drainage, weeding, and applying top dressing. Most of the wheat fields have been rescued and are growing normally.

This spring, farmers in various parts of East China have actively launched drought prevention and resistance campaigns. The amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers has also mostly exceeded that of previous years. In the Wuhu and Huizhou special districts of southern Anhui, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers has exceeded the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In northern Anhui and parts of Zhejiang, farmers have generally increased fertilizer accumulation by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In addition, cooperatives in the East China region have transferred and supplied over 1 billion jin of commercial fertilizers such as soybean cake, rapeseed cake, and fertilizer powder to farmers. The spring fertilizer needs of the entire region have been basically met.

During the spring plowing production campaign, mutual aid organizations have been universally reorganized and developed in various parts of East China. According to incomplete statistics from nine districts of Xuancheng County, southern Anhui, farmers have reorganized and newly formed 3,248 mutual aid teams in spring plowing and water conservancy spring repair projects. In the fourth district of Minhou County, Fujian Province, in addition to consolidating existing year-round mutual aid teams, many temporary plowing exchange teams were organized, enabling the rapid completion of spring plowing tasks. People on both sides of the Huai River basin and in northern Jiangsu, while transferring millions of strong laborers to participate in the Huai River control and farmland water conservancy projects, have meticulously organized all men, women, and children, ensuring that both spring plowing and Huai River control are not neglected.

In the Southwest region, rice seedling beds have generally begun sowing; in Mengzi and Yuanjiang and other places in southern Yunnan, rice transplanting has already begun. Since late March, various places have successively received spring rains, and seedlings in areas where sowing was earlier have grown to two or three inches. The harvesting of minor spring crops is approaching, and harvesting has begun in southern Sichuan and Yunnan. The cold Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has also begun to thaw, and people of all ethnic groups are actively preparing for spring plowing.

After completing land reform work before spring plowing, land reform work teams in various parts of the Southwest region immediately devoted all their efforts to leading spring plowing production. Local governments have taken many measures to support farmers who have newly acquired land in engaging in spring plowing production. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee has decided to issue 150 million jin of various agricultural loans in the form of grain and 140 billion yuan in funds; and has decided to issue 15 billion yuan in relief funds to a few areas experiencing spring famine. Currently, governments, banks, cooperatives, and other institutions in various parts of the Southwest have sent out large numbers of cadres to form agricultural loan teams, going deep into the countryside to distribute loans to farmers. The more than 700 rural cooperatives newly established in the Southwest have begun supplying large quantities of fertilizer and farm tools for the first time this year. The Southwest Cooperative Affairs Bureau has purchased more than 31 million jin of fertilizer in various places, and has transferred more than 3,000 tons of chemical fertilizer and soybean cake from Northeast China and other places, continuously supplying the rural areas. This year, cooperatives have supplied more than 6 million pieces of agricultural implements to various places. In addition, with the support and encouragement of local governments, many small agricultural tool factories have been opened, producing large quantities of agricultural tools. The people's governments in areas where land reform has been completed have also actively mobilized farmers to invest the fruits of land reform in spring plowing production.

During the spring plowing production, governments at all levels and the vast number of farmers launched an unprecedented drought resistance and prevention campaign. Farmers in various places continued to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics from eastern Sichuan, more than 15,000 ponds and more than 4,500 weirs have been repaired before spring plowing, irrigating more than 420,000 mu of land. The small-scale water conservancy projects repaired in the entire province of Xikang can irrigate 110,000 mu of farmland. Northern and southern Sichuan and other places have also inspected and renovated the ponds and weirs repaired last winter to make them more conducive to farmland irrigation. Farmers in some mountainous areas of Yunnan and Guizhou have launched a search for water sources campaign, increasing the irrigation area of mountain land.

In this year's spring plowing production, mutual aid organizations have begun to develop in rural areas of the Southwest. More than 6,700 mutual aid teams have been organized in the Suining Special District of northern Sichuan during the spring plowing and drought resistance campaign. More than 2,500 mutual aid teams have been organized in Longchang County, southern Sichuan, effectively promoting spring plowing production work. The patriotic production increase competition campaign has been vigorously launched in the vast rural areas of the Southwest.

Farmers in the Northwest also have high production enthusiasm. Spring plowing in Shaanxi Province began in mid-March. As of March 26, more than 60% of the wheat fields in the Guanzhong Plain area had been weeded. Spring plowing has also begun in Qinghai Province. Due to the cold climate in Qinghai, wheat is sown entirely in the spring. As of March 21, spring plowing and wheat sowing work had been fully launched in the warmer counties of Minhe, Ledu, Xunhua, and Guide; spring plowing has also begun in some areas of the suburbs of Xining City and Huangzhong, Huzhu, and Gonghe counties. Spring plowing and wheat sowing have also begun in various counties in Ningxia and the Turpan Basin in southern Xinjiang Province.

In order to solve the specific difficulties of farmers in spring plowing production and to effectively support farmers' drought prevention and resistance campaigns, governments at all levels in the Northwest have taken many important measures. The water conservancy loan, one item of the huge amount of agricultural loans lent by the Northwest Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China, will increase the irrigated area of farmland in the Northwest by 3.1 million mu. The Northwest Cooperative General Store has purchased 13,000 tons of oil dregs in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and is lending and selling them to farmers. Another 2,000 tons of soybean cake and 5,000 tons of chemical fertilizer are being transferred from Northeast China in succession, continuously being transported into rural areas in various parts of the Northwest. Qinghai Province has lent 1,300 walking plows and 200 seed drills to farmers. In order to prevent wheat bunt disease, the governments of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are vigorously promoting the seed disinfection method of treating seeds with medicine.

In order to teach farmers the scientific technology of agricultural production, so as to achieve the goal of increasing yield per unit area, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government widely promoted the work of imparting scientific agricultural technology in the counties of Jingyang, Sanyuan, Weinan, Lintong, and other 15 major wheat and cotton producing areas in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, last winter and this spring. Fifteen work teams composed of more than 280 agricultural administrative and technical cadres at all levels and students from the Northwest Agricultural College trained township and village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, model laborers, production experts, and old farmers in the above counties. Now, those who have been trained have returned to their villages and are teaching the vast number of farmers. The mass agricultural technology learning movement has greatly improved farmers' understanding of science and technology and their confidence in achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, and has played a major role in promoting this year's spring plowing production campaign. In order to consolidate farmers' learning achievements and continue to carry out technical teaching work, many villages have established technical groups.

In addition, in order to deeply mobilize and specifically lead farmers' spring plowing production campaign, governments at all levels in the Northwest have convened various cadre meetings, and leading officials at all levels have personally gone to the countryside to conduct on-the-spot inspections.

    华东西南西北春耕生产进入紧张阶段
    普遍注意增施肥料兴修水利改进技术发展互助合作组织
    华东春耕生产已进入紧张阶段。长江以北春地耕耙正紧，不少地区已耕耙了三、四遍，即将动手播种。江淮和江南水稻地区也纷纷耕田、浸种，准备播种；福建南部双季稻地区早稻已普遍插秧。全区一亿一千五百多万亩麦田，大部经过锄草和施追肥，一般都生长得很好。福建南部小麦已收割完毕，该省其他地区也即将收割。苏南、苏北、皖南、浙江等地部分地区因春季雨水过多而被淹的小麦及其他作物，农民正在大力开沟排水、锄草追肥，大部分麦田已经救出，生长正常。
    今年春天，华东各地农民积极展开了防旱抗旱运动。农民的积肥量也大多超过往年。皖南的芜湖、徽州等专区农民的积肥量都超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平。皖北和浙江部分地区，农民积肥一般比去年增加一成到二成；此外，华东全区合作社已调运豆饼、菜饼、肥田粉等商品肥料十亿多斤供应农民。全区春季所需肥料，已基本上得到解决。
    在春耕生产运动中，华东各地又普遍整理和发展了互助组织。据皖南宣城县九个区的不完全统计，农民在春耕和水利春修工程中共整理和新组成了三千二百四十八个互助组。福建省闽侯县第四区各乡除整顿原有的常年互助组外，还组织了许多临时性的耕田变工组，使春耕任务迅速完成。淮河流域两岸和苏北各地人民，在抽调数百万身强力壮的劳动大军参加治淮和兴修农田水利工程的情况下，将所有男女老少周密地组织起来，作到了春耕治淮两不误。
    西南全区秧田已普遍开始播种；云南南部蒙自、元江等地都已插秧。自三月下旬起，各地曾先后获春雨，播种较早的地区，秧苗已长出二三寸。各地小春作物已接近收割阶段，川南、云南已开始收割。气候寒冷的康藏高原，也开始解冻，各族人民正在积极准备春耕。
    西南区各地土地改革工作队在春耕前完成土地改革工作后，立即把全部力量投入春耕生产的领导。各地人民政府采取了许多措施，扶助新分得土地的农民从事春耕生产。西南军政委员会特决定发放各种农贷粮食一亿五千万斤，款一千四百多亿元；并决定对少数发生春荒的地区发放救济款项一百五十亿元。现在，西南各地人民政府、银行、合作社等机构，都已派出大批干部，组成农贷小组，深入农村向农民发放。全区刚成立的七百多个农村合作社，今年开始第一次大量供应肥料和农具。西南合作事业局在各地收购了肥料三千一百多万斤，并从东北等地调运来化学肥料及豆饼三千多吨，源源供应各地农村。今年由合作社供应各地的农具达六百多万件。此外，各地在人民政府扶持和奖励下并开设了许多小型农具工厂，大量生产农具。各地完成土地改革区域的人民政府还积极动员农民将土地改革果实投入春耕生产。
    在春耕生产中，各级人民政府和广大农民展开了空前未有的抗旱防旱运动。各地农民继续兴修小型农田水利。据川东不完全统计：在春耕前已修好塘一万五千多口，堰四千五百多道，灌溉面积达四十二万多亩。西康全省修好的小型水利，可灌农田十一万亩。川北、川南等地并检查和改修去冬所修的塘堰，使之更利于农田灌溉。云南、贵州等部分山区农民展开寻找水源运动，增加了山地的灌溉面积。
    在今年的春耕生产中，西南各地农村开始发展互助组织。川北遂宁专区在春耕抗旱运动中共组织了六千七百多个互助组。川南隆昌县组织了二千五百多个互助组，有力地推动了春耕生产工作。爱国增产竞赛运动已在西南广大农村蓬勃展开。
    西北各地农民生产情绪也很高。陕西省的春耕在三月中旬即普遍展开。关中平原地区麦地，截至三月二十六日已锄过百分之六十以上。青海省的春耕也开始了。青海气候寒冷，小麦全在春季播种。截至三月二十一日，气候较暖和的民和、乐都、循化、贵德等县的春耕种麦工作已全面展开；西宁市郊和湟中、互助、共和等县的部分地区也已开始春耕。宁夏各县、新疆省南部吐鲁番盆地也已开始春耕种麦。
    为了解决农民春耕生产中的具体困难和有效地支援农民的防旱、抗旱运动，西北各级人民政府采取了许多重要措施。中国人民银行西北区行贷放的巨额农业贷款中的水利贷款一项，即将使西北农田灌溉面积增加三百一十万亩。西北合作社总社已在陕西关中各地收购油渣一万三千吨，向农民贷售。另有二千吨豆饼和五千吨化学肥料正从东北陆续调拨，源源运入西北各地农村。青海省已把一千三百架步犁和二百架耧贷给农民。为了防止春小麦的黑穗病害，甘肃、宁夏、青海三省人民政府正大力推广药剂拌种的种子消毒法。
    为了教给农民农业生产的科学技术，达到提高单位面积产量的目的，西北军政委员会农林部、陕西省人民政府农林厅去冬今春在陕西省关中泾阳、三原、渭南、临潼等十五个麦、棉主要产区的县份，广泛推行科学的农业技术传授工作。由各级农业行政、技术干部和西北农业学院学生二百八十多人组成的十五个工作队，在上述各县调集乡、村干部、互助组长、劳动模范、生产能手和老农等训练。现在，这些受训的都已回村，正在向广大农民传授。群众性的农业技术学习运动，大大提高了农民对于科学技术的认识和今年粮棉丰产的信心，并对今年的春耕生产运动起了重大的推动作用。为了巩固农民的学习成绩和继续进行技术传授工作，许多村庄都成立了技术小组。
    此外，为了深入动员和具体领导农民的春耕生产运动，西北各级人民政府曾召开了各种干部会议，各级负责人并纷纷亲自下乡实地检查。
