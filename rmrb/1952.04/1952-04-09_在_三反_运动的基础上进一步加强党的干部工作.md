    Further Strengthen Party Cadre Work on the Basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement

    The great achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement have not only had a positive impact on the economy and politics but have also ensured that all cadres, without exception, have been tested, educated, and reformed in this serious struggle. The movement has not only eliminated a group of corrupt and degenerate elements but has also brought forth a large number of outstanding individuals with both integrity and ability. The number of these individuals far exceeds the number of those incorrigible degenerates who have been eliminated, adding much fresh blood and reserve forces to the cause of the Party and the country. After this movement, the outlook of the Party and state cadres has been completely renewed, and a healthy atmosphere is rising vigorously. The significance of this for purifying and strengthening the revolutionary organization and promoting the current revolutionary cause is inestimable.

    Our Party and state cause has never needed so many thousands upon thousands of cadres who can competently handle the current revolutionary and construction tasks as it does today. These cadres must have a certain level of Marxism-Leninism, be able to maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle, cherish state public property as they cherish their own eyes, be able to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, learn what they did not originally understand, and be able to conquer all enemies with guns while destroying the old world, and also be able to repel the bourgeois attacks of sugar-coated bullets while building a new world. Without such a sound contingent of cadres, the Party's correct policies cannot be truly implemented, and the fundamental guarantee for all national construction work and the socialist future cannot be obtained. The "Three-Anti" Movement has shown that the bourgeoisie's corruption of the state's cause and the working class's cause starts with the cadres. They send some in, pull some over, and carry out many criminal activities in this regard, ruining many cadres who were originally pure and revolutionary, in order to achieve their selfish and despicable goals. Therefore, the "Three-Anti" Movement is not only carried out through arduous screening and education work for cadres, but the great victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement can only be consolidated, maintained, and promoted through correct cadre policies and cadre work.

    The argument that "the Three-Anti struggle has left few cadres to do work" is completely wrong and does not conform to the facts at all. Those who make this argument seem to be starting from the premise of valuing cadres and caring about work, but in reality, if we were to treat the cadre issue with the same irresolute attitude towards the "Three-Anti" Movement that these people have adopted, the result would only be to harm the cadres and harm the work. The way these people treat the cadre issue is just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report on revising the Party Constitution, they do not "understand the Party's cadre issue and cadre policy from a political perspective," but "only understand the Party's cadre issue from an organizational perspective," or even "only understand the cadre issue from the perspective of the cadre issue." In this way, they are bound to deviate from the needs of the current objective situation and the Party's political principles when dealing with the Party's cadre issues and organizational issues; they are bound to adopt an erroneous, conservative, and appeasing attitude on the cadre issue, replacing the Party's political principles with vulgar relationships of "old colleagues" and "old subordinates," and replacing the Marxist-Leninist principles with a bureaucratic attitude towards cadres. Instead of thoroughly reviewing their own cadre policies and cadre work based on the serious facts revealed in the "Three-Anti" Movement, and formulating practical and effective improvement measures, they are afraid that the "Three-Anti" Movement will eliminate or hurt their "old colleagues" and "old subordinates" whom they originally thought were "easy to handle" but were indeed rotten or had begun to rot, and therefore it would be difficult to do "work". They completely fail to understand that if we do not resolutely eliminate those few elements who have committed serious corruption and waste and are incorrigible, and do not promptly rescue those who have committed errors but can and should be saved, but continue to treat them with a decadent conservative, appeasing attitude or vulgar personnel views, then they will in the future turn around and contaminate more of us, so that those who can be saved will not be easily saved in the future, and if the corrupt elements are not removed, new forces will not be able to grow. Therefore, the Party's cadre work must gain profound and beneficial experiences and lessons from this "Three-Anti" Movement. It is entirely appropriate to feel a heavy responsibility today for some shortcomings that have occurred in cadre work in the past (of course, the primary responsibility for cadres making mistakes should be borne by the cadres themselves). But the issue today is to do a good job of future work, and it is not permissible to continue to adopt a paralyzed, laissez-faire, and bureaucratic attitude. The erroneous views mentioned above on the cadre issue must be resolutely corrected.

    The "Three-Anti" Movement has proved that the vast majority of our cadres are good or basically good, but those cadres who have made mistakes must be given resolute and appropriate treatment. Those who have completely lost the qualifications of a Party member must be purged from the Party (this is a very small number); all those who have received administrative and Party disciplinary actions should be given appropriate work according to the errors they have committed, the punishments they have received, and their own repentance, and continue to be educated and reformed in their work; if they are not suitable to continue working in their current department or region, then the organization and personnel departments should transfer and assign them elsewhere. In handling issues, it is wrong to be sloppy and careless and lose seriousness, but it is also wrong to strive for education without striving for education and to adopt pure punishment.

    Promoting cadres has become an important topic in current cadre work. The large number of Party and non-Party activists who have emerged in the "Three-Anti" Movement, especially the many outstanding individuals among the working people, should be boldly, massively, and systematically promoted to various leading positions after being reviewed by the leading organs and the masses, in order to increase new blood in the work of the Party and the state and improve the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organization. This is one of the important goals of the "Three-Anti" Movement. It is also permissible to promote particularly outstanding individuals beyond their rank if necessary. On this issue, we must oppose erroneous seniority views, conservative thinking, private favoritism, sectarian sentiments, and purely technical or cultural views that do not ask about politics. The "Three-Anti" Movement has exposed that these views and thoughts are harmful to the cause of the Party and the state, belong to the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie, and must be criticized and corrected. What is our standard for selecting cadres? Our only standard for selecting cadres is to have both integrity and ability, and there is no second standard. That is to say, our cadres must serve the cause of the Party and the state unconditionally rather than conditionally, wholeheartedly rather than half-heartedly, be well connected with the people and serve the people, and have certain work experience and ability to handle a certain job. This is the cadre with both integrity and ability that we require. When Chairman Mao talked about the cadre policy at the Sixth Plenary Session, he instructed us that our cadre policy is: "Resolutely implement the Party's line, obey the Party's discipline, have close ties with the masses, have the ability to work independently, be active and willing to work, and not be for personal gain, etc. as the standard." "Appointing people on their merit" is the cadre policy implemented by the working class and only the working class can seriously implement it; "appointing people on personal considerations" is the cadre policy implemented by all exploiting classes (including the bourgeoisie) and even the petty bourgeoisie. We must draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie and even the petty bourgeoisie in cadre policy and cadre work. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on revising the Party Constitution: Some people "require us to primarily and solely estimate the length of his Party membership and the level of his qualifications when selecting cadres; others only use the ability to speak and write as the standard when selecting cadres, regardless of whether it is practical, or use the ability to blindly obey themselves as the standard, or use their relationship with themselves as the standard. Obviously, it is incorrect to use these standards to select cadres."

    According to the current situation, the work of promoting and deploying cadres must proceed from the overall situation, be carried out in a unified manner according to the priority of the work, with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner, and oppose departmentalism; this work must also be closely combined with the work of adjusting the organizational structure. The work of restoring various institutions after the "Three-Anti" Movement is not a simple restoration, but must be based on the principle of streamlining, filling those that should be filled, tightening those that should be tightened, merging those that should be merged, and resolutely abolishing those that should be abolished or are not yet very needed. The "Three-Anti" Movement must also achieve the effect of opposing extravagance and waste in personnel matters, and thoroughly correct all phenomena of overstaffing. Only in this way can cadres be better and more appropriately used and the effectiveness of cadres' work be fully utilized.

    In cadre work, paying attention to strengthening the strength of the national economic organs first, and enhancing the cadres of the national economic organs, has its special importance at present and is also one of the direct achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement. In this regard, in addition to boldly and massively promoting outstanding working-class individuals who have emerged in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the Party and state cadre management departments should make plans to resolutely and within a limited time period transfer a large number of strong cadres with both integrity and ability and with considerable work ability to the state's industrial, mining, enterprise, and financial departments, and effectively strengthen the leading organs of national economic construction and various basic core departments. It is absolutely not permissible to use force equally or to fill positions with incompetent people in this regard, otherwise, mistakes will inevitably be made. Some leading organs and cadre management departments that have not yet made up their minds on this should make up their minds immediately, and those that have not yet made a plan should make a plan immediately and strictly implement it. The relevant leading organs of the Party and the state should also convene meetings to discuss this matter. Education should be strengthened for the broad masses of cadres, especially for cadres engaged in national economic work, explaining that engaging in economic work according to the needs of the Party and the state and doing their economic work well is an important indicator of testing whether each cadre has a thorough understanding and infinite loyalty to the cause of new democratic construction and the socialist future, and for Party members, it is even more an important indicator of testing whether Party spirit is sound. The Party should, during and after the "Three-Anti" Movement, especially strengthen the education of all economic workers, reminding them that the national economic organs are the key and advancing base of our country, that the cadres who do economic work bear a very important and glorious responsibility, and that they must constantly strengthen their training, continuously improve their level, and cautiously and humbly complete the glorious task entrusted to them by the Party and the state, and in all aspects, guard against the corrosion of bourgeois ideology on national economic personnel and the theft of state property by bourgeois elements. Outstanding national economic workers who have been tested by the "Three-Anti" Movement and have been consistently honest and devoted to public service, loyally protecting state property, and have made outstanding contributions to their work, should receive due commendation in this summary of the "Three-Anti" Movement, in order to establish a model standard for national economic workers.

### 在“三反”运动的基础上进一步加强党的干部工作

    在“三反”运动的基础上进一步加强党的干部工作
    “三反”运动的伟大成果，不仅已在经济、政治等方面发生了良好的影响，而且使一切干部都无例外地在这场严重斗争中受到了应有的考验和教育改造。在运动中不但清除了一批贪污蜕化分子，而且涌现出了大批德才兼备的优秀分子，而这些人的数目是远远地超过了那些业已被清除出去的不可救药的蜕化堕落分子的数目，为党和国家事业增添了许多新生力量和后备力量。经过这次运动，党和国家干部的面貌已焕然一新，健康气象蓬勃上升，这对于纯洁、健全革命组织和推动当前革命事业的意义是不可估计的。
    我们的党和国家的事业从来没有像今天这样需要大批的成千成万的能够胜任当前革命任务和建设任务的干部，这些干部必须是有一定的马克思列宁主义水平，能够保持艰苦奋斗的优良作风，爱护国家公共财产如同爱护自己的眼珠一样，能够掌握批评和自我批评的武器，学会原来不懂的东西，在破坏一个旧世界的时候能够征服一切拿枪的敌人，在建设一个新世界的时候也能够击退资产阶级用糖衣裹着的炮弹的进攻。如果没有这样一批健全的干部，则我们党的正确方针便不可能真正贯彻实现，国家一切建设工作和社会主义前途便不可能获得根本保证。在“三反”运动中可以看到，资产阶级对于国家事业和工人阶级事业的腐蚀，也是首先从干部开刀的，派进来一些，拉过去一些，在这方面进行了许多罪恶活动，断送了不少原来是纯洁的革命的干部，以此达到其自私自利的卑污目的。因此，“三反”运动不仅是通过繁重的对干部的审查、教育工作来进行的，而且，“三反”运动的伟大胜利成果，也只有通过正确的干部政策和干部工作，才能得到巩固的保持和发扬。
    “三反斗争使得没有多少干部可以做工作”了，这种论调是完全错误的，完全不符合事实的。发出这种论调的人好像是从重视干部、关心工作出发，实际上如果按照这些人对“三反”运动所采取的那种不坚决的态度去对待干部问题，其结果只能是损害干部，损害工作。这些人对待干部问题，正像刘少奇同志在关于修改党章的报告中所讲的，不是“从政治上来理解党的干部问题与干部政策”，而“仅仅从组织上来理解党的干部问题”，甚至“仅仅从干部问题上来理解干部问题”。这样，他们必然要离开当前客观形势发展的需要，离开党的政治原则，来对待党的干部问题和组织问题；必然会在干部问题上采取错误的保守、姑息态度，以“老同事”“老部下”的庸俗关系来代替党的政治原则，以对待干部的官僚主义态度来代替马克思列宁主义的原则。他们不从“三反”运动中所暴露出来的严重事实，切实检讨自己的干部政策和干部工作，从而制订切实有效的改进办法，反而害怕“三反”运动把他原来觉得“得心应手”但是确实腐烂了或已开始腐烂了的“老同事”“老部下”整掉了或整痛了，因此不好做“工作”。他们完全不了解现在我们如果不把那些少数犯有严重贪污、浪费错误而又不可救药的分子坚决整掉，不把那些虽犯有错误但尚可以也应该挽救的分子赶紧抢救过来，而继续以腐朽的保守、姑息态度或庸俗的人事观点对待他们，则他们将来反过来便要来侵染我们更多的人，这样就会使可以挽救的将来也不好挽救，而腐败的成分如不去掉，新的力量也便不可能生长起来。因此，党的干部工作必须在这次“三反”运动中取得深刻的和有益的经验教训，过去在干部工作上发生过一些缺点，今天感到责任沉重（当然，干部犯错误，主要责任应由干部自己来负），这是完全应当的。但今天的问题是要把今后的工作做好，不许再继续采取麻痹放任和官僚主义的态度。上述那些对待干部问题上的错误观点必须坚决纠正。
    “三反”运动证明我们绝大多数的干部都是很好的或基本上是好的，但对于那些犯有错误的干部，必须予以坚决的适当的处理。对于那些完全丧失了党员条件的人，必须将其清洗出党（这种人是极少数）；一切受到行政处分和党纪处分的人，均应分别其所犯错误、所受处分及本人悔改情况，分别给以适当工作，在工作中继续教育改造；如不宜于继续在本部门或本地区工作者，则由组织部门和人事部门另行调动分配。在处理问题上，马虎潦草的丧失严肃性的作法是错误的，但应当争取教育而不加争取教育、采取单纯的惩办主义的作法也是错误的。
    提拔干部已成为当前干部工作的重要课题。“三反”运动中涌现出来的大批党和非党积极分子特别是劳动人民中的许多优秀分子，应当经过领导机关和群众的审查，大胆地大批地和有计划地把他们提拔到各种领导岗位上来，以增加党和国家工作的新血液，提高革命组织的战斗力，这是“三反”运动的重要目的之一。对于特别优秀的分子，必要时越级提拔也是允许的。在这个问题上，必须反对错误的资历观点、保守思想和私人拉拢、宗派情绪以及不问政治的单纯技术观点或单纯文化观点。“三反”运动已暴露了这些观点和思想都是对党对国家的事业有害的，是属于资产阶级或小资产阶级的观点，必须加以批判纠正。什么是我们选拔干部的标准呢？我们选拔干部的唯一标准是德才兼备，除此以外没有第二个标准。这就是说，我们的干部必须是要无条件地而不是有条件地、全心全意地而不是三心两意地服务于党和国家的事业，很好地联系人民群众并且服务于人民群众，而且要具有一定的工作经验和办事能力，能担任一定的工作职务。这就是我们所要求的德才兼备的干部。毛主席在六中全会上谈到干部政策时曾指示我们说：我们的干部政策是：“坚决执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，与群众有密切联系，有独立工作能力，积极肯干，不为私利等等为标准。”“任人唯贤”，这是工人阶级所执行的也只有工人阶级才能够认真执行的干部政策；“任人唯私”，这是一切剥削阶级（包括资产阶级）以至小资产阶级所执行的干部政策，我们必须在干部政策和干部工作上把工人阶级和资产阶级乃至小资产阶级的这个界限划清。刘少奇同志在关于修改党章的报告中指出：有些人“要求我们在选拔干部时，首先地并且是唯一地估计他的党龄的长短和资格的高低；另有人在选拔干部时仅以能说会写为标准，而不问其切实与否，或者以能否盲目服从自己为标准，或者以与自己的亲疏关系为标准。很明显，用这些标准来选拔干部，都是不正确的。”
    按照目前的情况，提拔调配干部的工作必须从全局出发，统一地根据工作的轻重缓急，有重点有步骤地进行，反对本位主义；这个工作并须和调整组织机构的工作紧密地结合进行。“三反”运动后恢复各种机构的工作不是简单的复原工作，而是必须根据精简的原则，该充实者充实之，该紧缩者紧缩之，该合并者合并之，该撤销或暂时还不甚需要者则坚决地撤销之。“三反”运动也必须收到在人事方面反对铺张浪费之效，彻底纠正一切人浮于事的现象。也只有如此，才能更好地适当地使用干部和充分发挥干部的工作效能。
    在干部工作中，首先注意充实国家经济机关的力量，增强国家经济机关的干部，在目前有其特殊重要的意义，也是“三反”运动应有的直接成果之一。在这一方面，除了大胆地和大量地提拔在“三反”、“五反”运动中涌现出来的工人阶级优秀分子以外，党的和国家的干部管理部门应当做出计划，坚决地限期输送大批德才兼备的并且有相当工作能力的坚强干部到国家的工矿、企业、财经等部门中去，切实增强国家经济建设的领导机关和各种基本核心部门，在这方面决不可平均使用力量或滥竽充数，否则必将犯错误。有些领导机关和干部管理部门对此还没有下决心的应当立即下决心，还没有订出计划的应当立即订出计划，并且严格执行。党和国家的有关领导机关并应召开会议来讨论这件事情。对于广大干部特别对于从事国家经济工作的干部则应加强教育，说明按照党和国家的需要从事经济工作并且把自己所担负的经济工作做好，是考验每一个干部对新民主主义建设和社会主义前途是否具有透澈认识和无限忠诚的重要标志，在党员则更是考验党性是否健全的重要标志。党应当在“三反”运动中和“三反”运动后，特别加强对全体经济工作人员的教育，要他们谨记着国家经济机关是我们国家的要害和前进的基地，做经济工作的干部负有非常重大的光荣的责任，必须时刻加强自己的锻炼，不断提高自己的水平，谨慎谦虚地把党和国家所交付的这个光荣任务完成得好，并从各方面谨防资产阶级思想对国家经济人员的腐蚀及资产阶级分子对国家财产的盗窃活动。凡经“三反”运动考验证明确实一贯廉洁奉公、忠诚地保护着国家财产、并在工作上有出色贡献的优秀国家经济工作人员，应在此次总结“三反”运动时受到应得的表扬，借以树立国家经济工作者的模范标准。
