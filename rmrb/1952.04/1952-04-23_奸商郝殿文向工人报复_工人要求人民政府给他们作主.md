    Profiteer Hao Dianwen Retaliates Against Workers
    Workers Demand the People's Government Uphold Justice for Them
    
    Editor: We are workers at the private Zhengda Coal Mine in Mentougou, west of Beijing. The profiteer Hao Dianwen at our mine usually colludes with government cadres to evade taxes. He does not implement the labor-capital contract, and he does not provide medical expenses when workers get sick. Over the past year, he has used tricks to deduct more than 50 million yuan in wages from workers and underpaid the union for various expenses by more than 15 million yuan. He is nicknamed "Second Bandit," which shows how tyrannical he is. During the "Five-Anti" movement, after our repeated struggles, he confessed to some problems. Now, he is trying to retaliate against the workers, and he is in arrears of more than 40 million yuan in wages. We are so hungry that we cannot go to work. When we look for him, he says, "I'll pay you back when I sell the mine." We took him to the People's Government to reason with him, but when he got to the People's Government, he said, "I guarantee to go back and pay it off." But after returning to the mine, he avoided meeting us and said, "Whatever, I just don't have money, I really want to sit in court!" Some workers are sick from being hungry for too long. Daily output has dropped from 60 tons to more than 10 tons. Now we demand that the People's Government uphold justice for us workers, recover the wages he owes, and give this profiteer the punishment he deserves.

    奸商郝殿文向工人报复
    工人要求人民政府给他们作主
    编辑同志：我们是京西门头沟私营正大煤窑的工人。我窑奸商郝殿文平时拉拢机关干部逃税。他不执行劳资合同，工人生了病，他也不给医药费。一年来，他耍手法克扣工人工资五千多万元，少缴工会各种经费一千五百多万元。他外号“二土匪”，可见其蛮横了。“五反”运动中，经过我们一再斗争，他才谈出了一些问题。现在，他企图对工人报复，拖欠我们工资已达四千多万元。我们饿得上不了班，找他时，他说：“等我卖了窑再还你们。”拉他到人民政府说理，到了人民政府他却说：“保证回去还清。”而回窑上以后，他又避不见面，还说：“随便吧，就是没钱，我真想坐法院呢！”有的工人饿得太久，病了。每天产量从六十吨降低到十几吨。现在我们要求人民政府给我们工人作主，追还他所欠的工资，给这个奸商以应有的处罚。
