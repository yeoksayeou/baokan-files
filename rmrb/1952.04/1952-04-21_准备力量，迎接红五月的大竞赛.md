    Prepare Strength, Greet the Great Competition of Red May

    The great "May Day" International Labor Day is coming soon. On this day, our working class will review its fighting strength. This year, our working class launched a major counterattack against the blatant attack launched by illegal bourgeois elements against us, and achieved a great victory. We should celebrate this great victory.
    From the beginning of this year to the present, we have been engaged in a fierce struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and have continuously raised our class consciousness. Now the workers understand the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's attack on us, and also recognize the necessity of fighting and counterattacking the bourgeoisie. The workers of our power plant have come to understand that they are the class that determines the fate of China. Therefore, with a high sense of responsibility as masters, they have closely combined "tiger-fighting" with production, and have achieved great victories at the same time. Many groups in the plant have achieved very good results in production. The labor model Liu Dezhen's group has a total of nineteen people. During the "Three-Anti" movement, five people were withdrawn from production to participate in the anti-corruption struggle. Of the fourteen people remaining in the group, eleven people participated in this struggle in their spare time every day. However, their production was not affected. They greatly improved labor efficiency and completed their tasks on schedule. And in the first quarter, they saved the country wealth equivalent to more than 30,000 jin of millet in savings, utilization of waste, and rationalization proposals. During the overhaul of a certain furnace, the workers proposed a quick overhaul to fire the first shot on the 1952 production front. The Lin Zhenying group improved the working method, and the task of hitting the pipe head was overfulfilled by 37 percent. Thanks to the full enthusiasm and creativity of all the employees in the plant, in the first quarter of this year, by making full use of inferior coal, plus the workers' savings and utilization of waste, the cost was greatly reduced. The task of saving costs in the first quarter was overfulfilled by 8.51 percent.
    Now, the workers' high production enthusiasm is developing vigorously. Everyone is ready to greet the great competition of Red May; to greet the production competition for the country's large-scale construction work. Each group is preparing to overfulfill the plan and create achievements to welcome their "May Day" festival.

    准备力量，迎接红五月的大竞赛
    工业劳动模范

    刘英源
    伟大的“五一”国际劳动节就要来到了。在这一天，我们工人阶级要检阅一下自己的战斗力量。今年，我们工人阶级对不法资产阶级分子向我们所举行的猖狂进攻，来了一个大反击，并且取得了伟大的胜利。我们应该庆祝这个伟大的胜利。
    我们从今年年初到现在，一直进行着激烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，不断地提高着阶级觉悟。现在工友们都懂得了资产阶级向我们进攻的严重性，也认识了向资产阶级进行斗争和反击的必要性。我们发电厂的工友们已经懂得了自己是决定中国命运的阶级，因此以高度的主人翁的责任感，使“打虎”和生产紧紧结合起来，同时获得了巨大的胜利，全厂很多小组在生产上都创造了很好的成绩。劳动模范刘德珍的小组共有十九个人，在“三反”运动中抽出了五人脱离生产参加反贪污斗争，留在组里的十四个人中还有十一个人每天在业余时间参加这个斗争。但是，他们的生产并没有受影响。他们大大地提高了劳动效率，按期完成了任务。并且第一季度在节约、利用废物和合理化建议中就给国家节省了相当于三万多斤小米的财富。在大修某号炉时，职工们提出要快速检修，打响一九五二年生产战线上的第一号炮。林振英小组改进了工作方法，打管子头超额百分之三十七完成任务。由于全厂职工充分发挥了积极性和创造性，今年第一季度中，尽量利用劣质煤，加上工友们的节约和利用废物，成本大大降低了。第一季度全厂节约成本的任务超额完成百分之八点五一。
    现在，工友们这种高度的生产热情正在蓬勃地发展，每个人都做好了准备，迎接红五月的大竞赛；迎接准备祖国大规模建设工作的生产竞赛。每个小组都正在准备超额完成计划，创造成绩来迎接自己的“五一”节。
