Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 11th: James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, completed his investigation into the crimes of US imperialism in conducting bacterial warfare in the Northeast and departed from Shenyang by train for Beijing on the afternoon of the 10th.

After arriving in Shenyang on the 9th, James Endicott visited the "Exhibition of Evidence of US Imperialist Bacterial Warfare Crimes" on the same day. He examined in detail the bacteriological bombs dropped by American aircraft that had just been sent from Changbai County in Liaodong Province, and meticulously recorded the distinct American markings and text on the bomb casings. Subsequently, he interviewed witnesses who had seen American aircraft dropping another type of bacteriological bomb - Han Yongbin, a businessman from Kuandian County, and Li Sijian, a middle school student. In the evening, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, hosted a banquet for James Endicott and all members of the "Investigation Team on Crimes of US Imperialist Bacterial Warfare" who had just returned from investigating in Korea. After the banquet, a symposium was held, and reports were heard from bacteriology expert Zhu Jimin and pathology expert Li Peilin, among others.

On the morning of the 10th, James Endicott personally went to Jiuzhan Village in the suburbs of Shenyang for an on-the-spot investigation. He inquired in detail about the circumstances of local farmers Liu Guangyi and 73-year-old Zhao Wenxiu finding germ-carrying insects dropped by American planes. Zhao Wenxiu said: "With Chairman Mao's leadership, we will never be intimidated by the bacteriological weapons of US imperialism. When you return to your country, you must announce this intolerable crime of the US government." James Endicott expressed his deep admiration for the Chinese farmers' firm will to resist bacterial warfare and their intense engagement in spring plowing and other tasks. At 3 pm, James Endicott held a press conference at the Northeast People's Government Reception Office. He departed from Shenyang by train for Beijing in the evening. Liu Zhiming, Vice Chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association, Wang Bin, Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government, Deputy Minister Bai Xiqing, and Li Guisen, Director of the Reception Office, and others went to the station to see him off.

    实地调查美国细菌战罪行后
    文幼章离东北返北京
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】加拿大和平大会主席文幼章完成了对美帝国主义在东北进行细菌战罪行的调查后，已在十日下午由沈阳乘车返北京。
    文幼章在九日到达沈阳后，当天就前往“美帝国主义细菌战罪证陈列室”参观。他详细地检视了刚由辽东省长白县送来的美国飞机所投下的细菌炸弹，并详细地记录了弹壳上显明的美国标志和文字。随后，他又访问了目击美国飞机投掷另一种细菌弹的见证人——宽甸县商人韩永斌和中学生李思俭。当晚，东北人民政府副主席林枫设宴招待文幼章和刚从朝鲜调查回国的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”全体团员。宴会后，举行座谈，并听取细菌学专家朱既明和病理学专家李佩琳等的报告。
    十日上午，文幼章亲往沈阳市郊旧站村进行实地调查。他详细地询问了当地农民刘广义和七十三岁的老人赵文秀，关于他们发现美机投掷含菌毒虫的情况。赵文秀说：“我们有毛主席的领导，绝不会被美帝国主义的细菌武器所吓倒。你回到贵国后，一定要宣布美国政府这种令人不能容忍的罪行。”文幼章对我国农民的反细菌战的坚决意志，和他们紧张地从事春耕等情形，深表赞佩。下午三时，文幼章假东北人民政府交际处举行记者招待会，当晚乘车离沈阳回北京，东北抗美援朝总分会副主席刘芝明、东北人民政府卫生部部长王斌、副部长白希清、交际处处长李桂森等前往车站送行。
