Xinhua News Agency, April 26th Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese students and journalists are protesting against the fascist "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill."

Japanese students have decided to continue resolute action to oppose the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." On the 23rd, representatives of student self-government associations from fifteen universities in Tokyo held a meeting to discuss a joint struggle to crush the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." The meeting resolved to hold a strike or rally on April 28 to oppose the fascist bill and protest the entry into force of the separate peace treaty. Preliminary estimates indicate that at least 14,000 students from eight schools will participate in the general strike on the 28th.

Meanwhile, the Japan Newspaper Editors and Publishers Association issued a statement to Yoshida on the 23rd expressing concern that the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill" would allow the authorities to abuse their legal rights and harm freedom of speech in Japan. The statement pointed out that the bill's proposal did not adequately consider the impact it might have on hindering normal freedom of thought and speech. The statement said that the association's members firmly believe that the bill's prohibitions would make people afraid to freely express their opinions.

Japanese newspapers continue to criticize the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." The bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" said on the 23rd that the bill contains many of the same provisions as the wartime "Public Order Maintenance Law," which was used to suppress all criticism of the military clique.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th Dispatch from TASS Tokyo, April 24th: "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the Japanese government has decided to implement a general amnesty when the separate "peace treaty" comes into effect. More than one million people will be amnestied, but democratic elements convicted of violating so-called occupation regulations and the "Group, etc., Control Ordinance" will be excluded. The newspaper said that communist leaders will also not be amnestied. According to Kyodo News, well-informed sources expect that Japanese war criminals currently in Sugamo Prison will be amnestied.

    反对法西斯法案和单独“和约”生效
    日本学生决定大罢课
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本的学生和新闻工作者纷纷抗议法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”。
    日本的学生决定继续以坚决的行动来反对“防止破坏活动法案”。二十三日，东京的十五个大学的学生自治会的代表举行会议，讨论联合斗争以粉碎“防止破坏活动法案”的问题。会议决议在四月二十八日举行罢课或集会，反对法西斯法案并抗议单独和约的生效。据初步估计，参加二十八日大罢课的至少有八个学校的一万四千名学生。
    同时，日本报纸主笔与发行人协会在二十三日给吉田一个声明，表示担忧“防止破坏活动法案”将会使当局滥用法律上的权利，损害日本的言论自由。声明指出：该法案的提出并没有充分考虑到它可能产生的阻碍正常的思想和言论自由的影响。声明说：该协会的会员们坚决相信：法案中的禁令，会使得人民不敢自由发表意见。
    日本的报纸继续抨击“防止破坏活动法案”。资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”二十三日说：该法案中有许多和战时的“维持治安法”一样的规定，那些规定曾被用来压制对于军部势力的一切抨击。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社东京二十四日讯：“朝日新闻”报道：日本政府决定在单独“和约”实施时实行大赦。受到大赦的将有一百多万人，但那些因违反所谓占领法规和“团体等规正令”而被定罪的民主分子则被除外。该报说，共产党领袖们也将受不到大赦。据共同社消息：消息灵通方面的人们预料目前在巢鸭监狱中的日本战犯将受到大赦。
