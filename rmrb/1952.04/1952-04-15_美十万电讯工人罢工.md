Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 11th: Nearly 68,000 telecommunications workers belonging to the CIO-affiliated Communications Workers of America went on strike on the 7th in more than 40 states to demand wage increases. The strike was initially launched by 16,000 workers at Western Electric Company, and later joined by 52,000 telephone workers at Bell Telephone Company in Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey, Nevada, and California. The strike has severely hampered telecommunications traffic across the United States. Large-scale picketing by striking workers will halt work for another 300,000 telephone industry employees nationwide.

At the same time, the strike of more than 30,000 telecommunications workers at Western Union, belonging to the AFL's Commercial Telegraphers' Union, which began on the 3rd, continued through the 8th. Striking workers have set up picket lines in front of Western Union offices across the country, bringing the company's telegraph and money transfer business to a standstill at its 3,000 branches nationwide.

    美十万电讯工人罢工
    【新华社十一日讯】纽约消息：产联美国电讯工人工会所属近六万八千名电讯工人为要求增加工资，于七日上午在美国四十多个州中举行了罢工。罢工首先是由西方电气公司的一万六千名工人发动的，后来贝尔电话公司在密执安州、俄亥俄州、新泽西州、内华达州和加利福尼亚州的五万二千名电话工人也参加了罢工。罢工使美国全国的电讯交通受到严重的障碍。罢工工人们的大规模纠察行动将使全国另外三十万电话业雇员停止工作。
    与此同时，属于劳联商用电报工人工会的三万余名西方联合公司的电讯工人从三日开始的罢工，至八日止仍在继续中。罢工工人在西方联合公司全国各地的办公处前布置了纠察线，使该公司在全国的三千个分支公司的电报和汇款的业务陷于停顿。
