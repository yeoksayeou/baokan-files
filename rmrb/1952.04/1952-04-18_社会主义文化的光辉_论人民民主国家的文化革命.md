    The Glory of Socialist Culture
    -- On the Cultural Revolution in People's Democratic Countries
    Pavel Yudin, Soviet Union
    The capitalists and landlords who hold power attempt to monopolize all the achievements of culture, science, and technology. In order to exploit the working people more effectively and extract more surplus value, they leave the working people only a little "enlightenment" necessary for them.
    The working people of capitalist countries struggle tenaciously to gain access to education and culture. No social class has spent as much effort as the working class in its pursuit of knowledge and culture. Workers endure heavy sacrifices to educate their children. Trade unions led by progressive individuals organize night schools, training courses, lectures, and libraries to satisfy the workers' desire for knowledge. Workers attend these amateur self-study organizations after long hours of arduous work, but capitalist bosses devise various methods to undermine these small but cultural bases for the working people.
    Engels pointed out in his time that only the working class among all classes in modern society possesses a genuine thirst for and love of theoretical knowledge. This is a fact of great significance! It shows that the working class is the true heir to all progressive achievements of human thought, and the only class that can liberate the workers from exploitation and guarantee the development of productive forces and culture.
    Capitalism, which cultivates enslavement and poverty, sets up huge obstacles in the path of workers and peasants seeking science and knowledge. Under capitalism, the efforts of the working people to master culture encounter insurmountable obstacles. In pre-revolutionary Russia, three-quarters of the population was illiterate. In China, before the victory of the revolution, illiteracy accounted for 90 percent of the national population. In old Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, about half of the population was uneducated. Millions of working people in India, the United States, France, Italy, and many other capitalist countries are still condemned to a life of ignorance and mediocrity.
    Historical experience proves that only after the people have taken power into their own hands can a free and broad road to knowledge and culture, and to the most progressive mode of production based on the latest achievements of science and technology, be opened up before them.
    The great historical experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union clearly demonstrates how correct Lenin's words were that a cultural revolution must be carried out for the victory of socialism. Stalin, the brilliant successor to Lenin's cause, comprehensively studied the theory of cultural revolution. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, our country has implemented large-scale reforms. In a short period of less than thirty years, the Soviet Union has become the most civilized country in the world.
    We have not only long eliminated illiteracy, but most of the people have received at least seven years of education. We have cultivated millions of intellectuals from among the workers and peasants, who have mastered the highest achievements of science and culture. The vast majority of government, economic sector, Party, and trade union workers, as well as leaders of state-owned farms and collective farms, are people with general and specialized secondary and higher education. In our socialist motherland, there is hardly a family of workers or collective farm peasants without someone who has received secondary or higher education, or who is studying in secondary or higher education institutions. The contradictions between mental and manual labor, and between urban and rural areas, have been thoroughly eliminated in our country. In the process of building communism, any significant differences in all these aspects will be further reduced and disappear.
    Such a process is unprecedented in history.
    For the people's democratic countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development, Lenin and Stalin's theory of cultural revolution is their guide, and the experience of Soviet cultural construction is their example.
    The people's democratic countries inherited a heavy legacy from the previous reactionary system: the economies of most countries were underdeveloped, they were dependent on foreign imperialism, and most of the people were illiterate. To eliminate these consequences of capitalist and landlord rule, the working class faces a truly arduous task.
    Now, in the people's democratic countries, the people's democratic system, which performs the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, is successfully carrying out the construction of the socialist economic and cultural foundations. Their industry and agriculture have far exceeded pre-war levels. Long-term plans for the development of the national economy are currently being implemented. The realization of these plans will enable the people's democratic countries to increase their productive forces by a factor of two by 1954 to 1955, turning themselves into developed industrial countries with agriculture based on modern technology and collective labor.
    A true cultural revolution comes with economic growth. This revolution is a new and brilliant confirmation that the growth of socialism and national culture are closely related.
    The people's governments of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and other countries have waged a large-scale struggle against illiteracy, allocating a lot of funds for this purpose and mobilizing all those who can teach. For example, in Poland, more than 60,000 literacy classes have been opened to eliminate illiteracy. At present, illiteracy has been basically eliminated in these countries.
    In the years since the establishment of the people's government, the increase in school networks has reached an unprecedented level. Bulgaria has built 754 new schools, and another 165 schools are under construction. In the past four years, Romania has built more than 2,000 school buildings. Previously, Poland had 4,430 seven-year schools, which could accommodate 27.2 percent of the country's school-age children. By 1950, Poland had 10,100 schools, where 80.4 percent of the country's children were studying. Now, the seven-year universal compulsory education system has been generally implemented in all people's democratic countries.
    Some capitalist countries have also announced the implementation of universal education. However, these declarations cannot be seriously implemented because the bourgeois governments do not actually care about the construction of schools, and the working people, no matter how hard they try, are unable to afford the cost of their children's education. In Italy, 70,000 school buildings are lacking, and there are 100,000 unemployed primary and secondary school teachers. According to official figures released by Grisby, the U.S. government's education commissioner, the United States needs 600,000 classrooms nationwide. As a result, 4 million American children cannot attend school, and many children only attend school for two to three hours a day. In rural France and Italy, due to the lack of schools, courses are often conducted in livestock pens, farmers' homes, and in the open air.
    Today, as imperialists engage in arms expansion, the education situation in capitalist countries is further deteriorating. For example, the United States' education budget for 1950 to 1951 was even less than the education budget for 1924 to 1925.
    However, the little culture that the working people have acquired with great difficulty is used by the bourgeois "civilizers" to oppose the working people themselves! They pour a stinking torrent of newspapers, books, movies, and "spiritual food" that are full of misanthropy, war mania, and that corrupts the human mind onto the working people.
    The working people of the people's democratic countries have the actual, not fictitious, possibility of educating their children in primary schools. As we have already pointed out, the number of new schools has surged and continues to increase. The material conditions of workers and peasants have improved unprecedentedly. The people's government has spent a lot of money on building university dormitories and issuing student grants. As a result, the children of every family in these countries can receive primary education, and the children of most families can receive secondary and higher education.
    Under capitalist rule, those who can receive secondary and higher education are mainly people from the exploiting classes. For example, in old Poland, children of workers accounted for less than 5 percent of university students, and children of peasants accounted for less than 9 percent. In the new Poland, 60 percent of university students are workers and peasants.
    In the people's democratic countries, a huge work of cultivating intellectual cadres from among workers and peasants has been launched. In Poland, in 1939, there were 28 higher education institutions with 48,000 university students; now in Poland, there are 72 higher education institutions with 120,000 people studying. In Czechoslovakia, there were only 10 universities and specialized colleges in 1938; during the period of the people's government, 18 new higher education institutions were opened, and the number of university students has more than doubled. In Hungary, in addition to higher education institutions, 82 technical schools have been opened to train experts for the national economy. There are technical night schools in enterprises and rural areas, where millions of workers and peasants study various knowledge without leaving production.
    The cultural revolution in the people's democratic countries has a truly national character. This revolution is popularized to all residents and all aspects of life. A large number of night schools and training courses have been established everywhere. The people's self-study is also widely unfolded. Tens of thousands of groups studying the latest scientific achievements have been established. For example, there are more than 1,300 Michurin groups in Romania, with 20,000 participants. In Poland, a national congress of Michurin scientific researchers was held. The people's governments have allocated huge sums of money to build cultural palaces, theaters, and cinemas.
    Where capitalism reigns, women have no rights. But socialism brings women complete equal rights and absorbs them into political and cultural activities. In the people's democratic countries, women have become an active force in the new society, participating in the management of the country and in political and cultural life in the same way as men.
    Only two years have passed since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and land reform has not yet been completed nationwide. However, the majority of the people have been liberated from feudal exploitation. In free and independent China, the working class and the working peasants allied with it are the main forces that determine domestic political life. In China, people are now creating the prerequisites for a smooth transition to building the socialist economic foundation.
    In a short period of time, New China has achieved truly outstanding achievements not only on the economic front but also in culture. Feudal lords kept the Chinese people in a state of ignorance for thousands of years. In the past hundred years, American, British and other imperialists, with the support of China's feudal lords and comprador bourgeoisie, suppressed the Chinese people's desire for independence and culture. The greatest people's revolution realized by the Chinese people has brought freedom to the people and opened the way for a cultural revolution.
    The great 500 million people have risen up to engage in conscious and historically significant creation. While working tirelessly on the construction shelves, they persist in learning. In the factory, new character boards are hung in front of the workers every day, and these characters remain in their memory. On the Huai River water conservancy construction project, peasants who were previously illiterate have now begun to write letters to their villages in their own handwriting - while working, they learned 200 to 300 characters in the first season of work... Last year, there were 25 million people entering winter schools in the People's Republic of China, and this year it is already 35 million!
    In the past, education in China has always been the property of feudal lords and the bourgeoisie. Now, 80 percent of primary school students are children of workers and peasants, and special middle schools have been established for them. Students receive material assistance from the state. The government has formulated a plan to train 200,000 experts needed for the national economy within five years.
    The cultural revolution guides the free nations to the ranks of the most advanced and most educated nations, a level that no capitalist country can reach. Socialist culture is a new culture. Its scientific basis is the most progressive philosophy - the theory of Marxism-Leninism. Socialist culture is the culture of the people. It is built on the purest and noblest moral foundations. All ideas and theories that oppose humanity: such as racism, national inequality, the morality of exploiters, and others, are contrary to it. Socialist culture is in line with the hopes, demands and moral standards of the working people: that is, the demand for peace, the demand for friendship between all nations, the demand for creativity in labor and continuous progress. It is fundamentally different from and superior to bourgeois culture precisely in this.
    It is no coincidence that the people who overthrew the exploiters and took power into their own hands quickly turned everything most advanced and progressive in their own history and the history of all mankind into social property. It is natural that the people's democratic countries have published more scientific, literary, and other books in a few years than they had published in the past decades and centuries. Literature and art have entered the lives of the people, and they have become an integral part of the lives of the working people.
    Marxism-Leninism is the lighthouse for the construction of a new culture. The propaganda of the theory of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin is being popularized to the vast intellectuals, workers, and peasants in the people's democratic countries. Marxist-Leninist works are published in large quantities, but the supply always falls short of demand. The works of Lenin and Stalin have been translated into various languages and published in hundreds of thousands and millions of copies. In Poland, the total circulation of Comrade Stalin's works is 6 million copies. In Romania, nearly one million copies of the "Short Course on the History of the CPSU (B)" have been printed. The understanding of the creations of human genius has further improved the Marxist-Leninist worldview of the main intellectual cadres in the people's democratic countries.
    The construction of a new culture in the people's democratic countries is developing under the good influence of the great socialist culture created by the Soviet Union and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people. Our scientific and literary works have won the love of the people of these countries. The fact that a total of 23 million copies of works by Russian and Soviet writers have been published in Hungary in recent years is a typical example.
    The cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have fundamentally different characteristics from the relations between nations in the capitalist world. The cultural cooperation between the free nations has a socialist nature. This clearly shows that socialist culture has national form and highly international content.
    The victory of the cultural revolution and the establishment of socialist culture in the Soviet Union, and the success of the construction of a new culture in the people's democratic countries in the East and the West, are proofs that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system.
    Imperialism is the period of the decay and death of capitalism. In its death, it still spreads harmful poisons. The so-called culture in modern capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Italy is essentially anti-human. This culture cannot but be so because the main purpose of imperialism, the purpose to which everything is subordinated, is the unlimited pursuit of profit. For this purpose, capitalist monopolies bankrupt and starve the people of their own and enslaved countries. For this purpose, American imperialism is carrying out the entire militarization of the economy and preparing for a new war to fight for world hegemony and destroy socialism. The American reactionaries who dominate most capitalist countries are cultivating "dollar culture" everywhere, trying to morally poison the people and force them to submit to their will.
    But the laws of history are relentless. History has made its verdict - socialism is a new culture of mankind, a new civilization under whose banner nearly 800 million people have united. All mankind sees this new culture as a savior liberated from greedy imperialism.

    社会主义文化的光辉
    ——论人民民主国家的文化革命
    苏联  巴维尔·尤金
    掌握着政权的资本家和地主们企图独占全部文化、科学和技术的成果。为了更有效地剥削劳动人民，更多地榨取剩余价值，他们只留给劳动人民以很少一点“开化”他们所必要的文化。
    资本主义各国的劳动人民，是在顽强的斗争中来争取得到教育和文化的。在力求掌握知识和文化方面，任何社会阶层所费的力量都不能和工人阶级相比。工人们为了使子女受教育，要忍受沉重的牺牲。那些为进步人士所领导的职工会，为了满足工人这种求知的欲望，组织了一些夜校、训练班、讲演会和图书馆。工人们在长时间的繁重工作之后参加这些业余自修组织，但资本主义的老板们却想出各种方法来破坏这些规模虽小、但却是劳动人民的文化基地的组织。
    恩格斯在他的时代曾指出过，现代社会的各阶级中只有工人阶级才具有对理论知识的真正渴望和爱好。这是意味深长的事实！它说明工人阶级是一切人类进步思想成果的真正继承人，是把劳动者从剥削中解放出来并能保证生产力和文化发展的唯一阶级。
    培植奴役和贫困的资本主义，在工人农民寻求科学和知识的道路上设置了巨大的障碍。在资本主义的条件下，劳动人民企求掌握文化的努力遇到了难以克服的阻碍。在革命前的俄国，四分之三的人口是文盲。中国在革命胜利前，文盲占全国人口的百分之九十。在旧日的罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰，一半左右的人口没有文化。印度、美国、法国、意大利和许多其他资本主义国家的千百万劳动人民，直到今天仍被命定在黑暗和愚昧中过着得过且过的日子。
    历史经验证明，只有在人民把政权掌握在自己手里后，他们面前才开拓出一条走向知识和文化、走向基于科学和技术最新成就的最进步的生产方式的自由而广阔的道路。
    苏联社会主义建设的伟大历史经验，极明显地证明了列宁所说为了社会主义胜利就必须进行文化革命的话是如何正确。列宁事业的天才继承者斯大林全面地研究了文化革命的理论。在斯大林同志的领导下我国实行了大规模的改革。在短短的不到三十年的时间中，苏联变成了世界上最文明的国家。
    我们不仅早已消除了文盲，而且大部分人民都至少受到过七年教育。我们从工农中培育了千百万知识分子的队伍，他们已经掌握到科学和文化的最高成就。绝大多数的政府的、经济部门的、党和工会的工作者以及国营农场和集体农场的领导者们，都是受过普通和专门的中等和高等教育的人。在我们的社会主义祖国，几乎没有一个工人或集体农场农民的家庭中没有曾受过中等或高等教育、或是在中等或高等学校中学习的人。脑力劳动和体力劳动之间、城市和乡村之间的矛盾，在我国已被彻底消除。在建设共产主义的过程中，所有这些方面的任何重大区别，都将进一步减少和消逝。
    这样的过程在历史上还是空前的。
    对于走上社会主义发展道路的各个人民民主国家说来，列宁和斯大林关于文化革命的学说是它们的指南，而苏联文化建设的经验则是它们的榜样。
    各人民民主国家从以前的反动制度中接受了沉重的遗产：大多数国家的经济不发达，它们都依赖外国帝国主义，大多数人民都是文盲。为了消灭这些资本家和地主的统治后果，工人阶级面临着一项真正的艰巨工作。
    现在，在各人民民主国家中，执行着无产阶级专政职能的人民民主制度，正在成功地实行着社会主义的经济和文化基础的建设。它们的工业和农业已远超过了战前的水平。目前则正在实行发展国民经济的长期计划。这些计划的实现将使各人民民主国家能在一九五四到一九五五年中将自己的生产力提高
    一倍，把自己变成具有以现代技术和集体劳动为基础的农业发达的工业国家。
    真正的文化革命是伴随着经济上升而俱来的。这种革命是社会主义和全民文化的增长密切相关联的新的辉煌确证。
    波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、匈牙利、捷克等国的人民政权曾与文盲现象进行了大规模的斗争，它们在这方面拨出了很多经费并动员了所有能够教书的人。例如在波兰，为消除文盲而开办的识字班便有六万多所。目前在这些国家中，文盲现象已基本消灭。
    在人民政权建立后的年代中，学校网的增加达到了前所未有的程度。保加利亚建立了七百五十四所新的学校，另有一百六十五所学校正在修建中。四年以来，罗马尼亚修建了两千多所校舍。以前，波兰有四千四百三十所七年制的学校，可以容纳全国学龄儿童的百分之二十七点二。到一九五○年时波兰已有一万零一百所学校，在这里学习的儿童已达全国儿童总数的百分之八十点四。现在七年普及义务教育制已在各人民民主国家中普遍实行了。
    某些资本主义国家也曾宣布过实行普及教育制。但是这些宣告都不能认真执行。因为资产阶级政府实际上并不关心学校的建设，而劳动人民，则不管他们怎样努力也无力负担子女的教育费用。在意大利缺少七万所校舍，失业的中小学教师有十万人。根据美国政府的教育特派专员格里斯比所发表的官方数字，美国全国还需要六十万教室。由于这一原因而不能入学的美国儿童达四百万，而很多儿童每天只上二——三小时的课。在法国和意大利的农村里，由于学校的缺乏，课程时常是在牲畜栏、农民的房屋和露天中进行。
    在帝国主义者从事扩张军备的今天，资本主义国家的教育情况更加恶化了。例如美国一九五○到一九五一年的教育经费就比一九二四到一九二五年的教育经费还少。
    但是，连劳动人民很困难地获得的一点文化，资产阶级“传播文明的人们”都要利用它来反对劳动人民自己！他们把充满了仇视人类的、充满了战争狂暴气息的报纸、书、电影和使人类心灵腐朽的“精神食粮”的臭恶洪流，倾倒在劳动人民的身上。
    各人民民主国家的劳动人民，具有使自己的孩子在小学中受教育的实际的、而不是虚构的可能性。正如我们所已经指出的，新的学校数量已经激增并且还在继续增加。工人和农民的物质情况空前地改善了。人民政权在修建大学生宿舍和发给学生助学金方面用了很多钱。结果使这些国家中的每个家庭的子女都可以受到初等教育，而大多数家庭的子女则可以受到中等和高等教育。
    在资本主义统治下，能受到中等和高等教育的，主要是剥削阶级出身的人。例如，在旧的波兰，大学生中的工人子弟在百分之五以下，农民子弟在百分之九以下。在新的波兰，则百分之六十的大学生，都是工人和农民。
    在各人民民主国家中，展开了自工人和农民中培养知识分子干部的巨大工作。在波兰，一九三九年有二十八所高等学校，其中有四万八千名大学生；现在在波兰则有七十二所高等学校，其中有十二万人在学习。在捷克，一九三八年只有十所大学和专科学院；在人民政权的时期，又开办了十八所新的高等学校，大学生的数目扩大了一倍以上。在匈牙利，除去高等学校以外，又开办了八十二所技术专科学校，为国民经济培养专家。在各企业和各农村中有技术专科夜校，千万工人和农民都不脱离生产而学习各种知识。
    各人民民主国家中的文化革命，带有真正的全民性质。这种革命普及于全体居民和生活的各方面。各地都建立了大量夜校和训练班。人民的自学也广泛地展开着。建立了数万各种学习最新科学成就的小组。例如，在罗马尼亚有一千三百多个米丘林小组，参加的达二万人。在波兰，举行了米丘林科学研究者的全国代表大会。各人民政府，都拨出了巨额款项来建筑文化宫、剧院和电影院。
    在资本主义统治的地方，妇女是没有权利的。但社会主义则给妇女带来完全的平等权利，吸收她们参加政治和文化活动。在各人民民主国家中，妇女已成为新社会的积极力量，她们和男子同样地参加了管理国家，参加了政治和文化生活。
    中华人民共和国成立到现在只有二年多，土地改革还没有在全国完成。但是多数人民群众已经由封建剥削中解放出来了。在自由独立的中国，工人阶级和与它联盟的劳动农民，是决定国内政治生活的主要力量。在中国，人们现在正在为顺利地过渡到建设社会主义的经济基础而创造前提。
    在短期中，新中国不仅在经济战线上，而且在文化方面也已达到了真正卓越的成就。封建领主使中国人民数千年来处在愚昧无知的状态。近百年来，美英等帝国主义者在中国的封建主和买办资产阶级的支持下，压制了中国人民要求独立和文化的愿望。中国人民所实现了的最伟大的人民革命，给人民带来了自由并为文化革命开拓了道路。
    伟大的五万万人民已在奋起从事自觉的具有历史意义的创造。他们在建筑架上一边不停地工作，一边坚持学习。在工厂中，工人面前每天挂起新的字牌，于是这些字就留在他们的记忆中了。在淮河的水利建筑工程上，从前不识字的农民现在都开始亲笔向本村写信了——他们一边劳动，一边在工作的第
    一季学会了二百到三百个字……。去年，中华人民共和国中入冬学的人有二千五百万，而今年已经是三千五百万人了！
    过去，教育在中国一向只是封建主和资产阶级的财产。而现在，百分之八十的小学生是工农子弟，为他们还创办了专门中学。学生得到国家的物质援助。政府制订了一个在五年之中培养出二十万国民经济所需专家的计划。
    文化革命引导各自由民族到最先进的、最有教养的民族队伍中来，这些民族的水平是任何一个资本主义国家都达不到的。社会主义文化是新的文化。它的科学基础更是最进步的哲学——马克思列宁主义的学说。社会主义文化是人民的文化。它是建筑在最纯洁最高尚的道德基础上的。一切反对人类的思想和理论：如种族主义、民族不平等、剥削者的道德以及其他等等，都是和它背道而驰的。社会主义文化是符合于劳动人民的希望、要求和道德标准的：就是要求和平、要求各民族间的友谊、要求劳动中的创造精神和不断前进。它根本区别于资产阶级文化并优越于后者的地方也就在这里。
    推翻剥削者并把政权掌握在自己手中的人民，迅速地把本国历史和全人类历史中一切最先进和最进步的事物变成社会的财产，这并不是偶然的。各人民民主国家在短短数年中出版了过去数十年和数百年中它们所未曾出版过的那样多的科学、文艺和其他书籍，这是很自然的事情。文学、艺术进入了人民的生活，它们已成为劳动人民生活中不可分割的
    一部分。
    马列主义是新文化建设的灯塔。马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的宣传，正普及到人民民主国家中的广大知识分子、工人和农民中去。马列主义的著作大量地出版，但总是供不应求。列宁和斯大林的作品被译成各种语言并出版了数十万和数百万册。在波兰，斯大林同志的作品的总发行数是六百万部。在罗马尼亚仅是“联共（布）党史简明教程”便印发了近一百万册。对人类天才的创作的认识，进一步提高了人民民主国家中主要知识分子干部的马列主义世界观。
    各人民民主国家的新文化建设，是在苏联所创造的伟大社会主义文化的良好影响下，在苏联人民的兄弟般的帮助下发展起来的。我们的科学和文学作品博得了这些国家的人民的热爱。近年以来，在匈牙利，俄国和苏联作家的作品共出了二千三百万册就是一个典型的例子。
    苏联和各人民民主国家的文化联系，与资本主义世界中各民族间的相互关系，有着原则上不同的特点。各自由民族间的文化合作带有社会主义的性质。这明显地说明了社会主义文化是具有民族形式和高度国际性内容的。
    苏联文化革命的胜利和社会主义文化的建立，东西方各人民民主国家新文化建设的成功，这些就是社会主义制度较资本主义制度远为优越的证明。
    帝国主义是资本主义的腐朽和死亡的时期。它在死亡中还在散布有害的毒物。现代资本主义的美、英、法、意等国中的所谓文化，实质上则是反对人类的东西。这种文化之所以不能不如此，是因为帝国主义的主要目的，一切都服从于它的那个目的，便是无限制地追逐利润。为了这个目的，资本主义的垄断组织使他们本国的和被他们奴役的国家的人民陷于破产和饥饿的境地。为了这个目的，美帝国主义进行着全部经济的军国主义化，并为争取世界霸权和毁灭社会主义进行新战争准备。主宰着大多数资本主义国家的美国反动派正在各处培植“美元文化”，企图从道德方面毒害人民，使他们屈服自己的意志。
    但是历史的法则是铁面无情的。历史已作出了它的判决辞——社会主义是这样的一种人类的新文化，这样的一种新的文明，在它的旗帜下已团结了将近八亿人。全体人类已把这一新的文化，看做是由贪欲的帝国主义下解放出来的救星。
