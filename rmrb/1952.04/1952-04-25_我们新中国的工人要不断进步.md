    We Workers of New China Must Constantly Improve
    Ma Liu Hai, Labor Model of Datong Coal Mine

    The “May Day” International Labor Day, our working class’s holiday, is fast approaching. I feel very happy. Our New China is developing by leaps and bounds, and everyone is rushing forward. We can already see the beautiful and happy future of our New China.

    I was originally a coal miner at the Baitong Well of the Datong Coal Mine. In December 1950, I was transferred to the Third Mine to learn mechanical tunneling techniques. At that time, I really knew nothing about this technology. Sitting on the electric drill, I even asked where the electric drill was. However, at that time, I thought: the Third Mine has already adopted the new coal mining method, and if the tunnel excavation still uses the old method, it will definitely affect the promotion of the new coal mining method. I was determined to learn, humbly consulted the surrounding technicians, and encouraged all the workers in the group to boldly carry out multi-hole rapid tunneling experiments. We experimented with "multi-hole," "double-hole," and "single-hole," and finally created a method of cyclic tunneling with two and a half holes. After using this method, the tunneling efficiency was improved, and new tunneling records were continuously created. Last May, the entire group worked for twenty-five working days and advanced one hundred and eighty-seven meters and thirty-one centimeters, creating the highest tunneling record in the entire Datong Coal Mine. Last June, to welcome the Party's birthday – “July 1st,” our entire group tunneled three hundred and eighteen meters and seventy-one centimeters, creating a new national record. Before National Day last year, all the workers in the group presented new achievements in production as gifts for National Day. In the thirty-one working days from mid-August to early September, we gloriously completed the tunneling task of four hundred and seventy-nine meters, setting a new national record for rapid tunneling.

    With the improvement of our production, our lives have also improved. Before April last year, our monthly salary was only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per person. After May, it increased to more than 600,000 yuan, and after September, it further increased to more than 1 million yuan. This doesn't even include the bonuses given to us by many leading organizations! Last July, the Datong Municipal People's Government and the Datong Coal Mine Administration each awarded our group a bonus of 5 million yuan. All ten people in our group bought watches. A large clock has also been hung on the wall of my house. I also have a radio in my room. Four people in the group already own bicycles. A few days ago, Han Youfu also said he wanted to buy a bicycle. I said, "Okay! Our workers' lives have improved! It's time to buy a bicycle to ride; in the future, in a communist society, if we produce well, we can even ride in cars!" He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. Last "May Day," Zhao San and Han Yougui in the group were not yet married, but this year they are all married. Now the homes of coal miners are really different from before. The houses are brand new; the kang not only has mats but also mattresses, blankets, and new quilts. We eat white flour and rice. The children are all going to school.

    We will not forget how these days came to be. In order to welcome this year’s “May Day” International Labor Day, the workers’ enthusiasm for production is even greater. Recently, all the workers in the group have also launched a challenge to the workers of the First and Second Mines, launching a production increase and economy practice campaign, guaranteeing that they will tunnel 500 meters in April and achieve an attendance rate of 95%.

    This time, I am very honored to go to the Soviet Union to participate in the "May Day" observation ceremony. After arriving in the Soviet Union, I must study the advanced production experience of Soviet coal miners, and return to improve our production even more. We workers of New China must constantly improve.

    我们新中国的工人要不断进步
    大同煤矿劳动模范  马六孩
    我们工人阶级的节日—“五一”劳动节快到了。我心里非常高兴。我们的新中国在飞跃发展，我们每个人都在往前赶，我们已经能看到我们新中国美丽幸福的远景了。
    我原是大同煤矿白洞井的一个采煤工。一九五○年十二月，我被调到第三矿学习机械掘进技术。当时，对这个技术，我真是一门不通，坐在电钻子上，还问电钻子在那里。但是，当时我想：第三矿已采用新采煤法了，如果巷道掘进仍用旧方法，那一定会影响新采煤方法的推广。我下决心学，虚心请教周围的技术人员，并鼓舞全组职工大胆进行多孔道快速掘进试验。我们试验了“多孔道”、“双孔道”、“单空道”，最后创造出了两个半空道循环掘进的方法。运用这个方法后，掘进效率便提高了，连续创造出掘进的新纪录。去年五月，全组干了二十五个工作日，进了一百八十七公尺三十一公分，创全大同煤矿掘进的最高纪录。去年六月，为迎接党的生日——“七一”，我们全组掘进了三百一十八公尺七十一分，创造了全国的新纪录。去年国庆节前，全组职工又以生产上的新成绩作为国庆节的献礼。在八月中旬到九月上旬的三十一个工作日里，光荣地完成了四百七十九公尺的掘进任务，再创快速掘进的全国最高纪录。
    随着我们生产的提高，我们的生活也改善了。去年四月份以前，我们每人每月的工资，还仅三、四十万元，五月份以后，便增至六十多万元，九月份以后，更提高到一百多万元了。许多领导机关给我们的奖金，还没算在内呢！去年七月，大同市人民政府，大同煤矿管理局，各发给我组五百万元奖金。我们全组十个人，都买了手表。我家的墙上，还挂上了大钟。我屋子里也有了收音机。全组已有四个人自备自行车了。几天前，韩有富也说要买自行车。我说：“好吧！我们工人生活提高啦！该买一辆自行车骑；将来到共产主义社会，我们生产得好，还可以坐汽车哪！”他乐得合不上嘴。去年“五一”时，组里的赵三、韩有贵都还没有结婚，今年也都结婚了。现在煤矿工人的家，可真和以前不一样了。房子是崭新的；炕上不但有了席子，而且有了褥子、毯子、新被子。吃的都是白面、大米。小孩也都上学了。
    我们不会忘记这日子是怎样来的。为了迎接今年的“五一”劳动节，职工们生产的劲头更大了。最近，全组工人，又向第一、二矿工人提出挑战，展开增产节约竞赛，保证四月掘进五百公尺，出勤率达到百分之九十五。
    这次，我到苏联参加“五一”劳动节观礼，我感到很光荣。到苏联以后，我一定要好好学习苏联煤矿工人的先进生产经验，回来后把我们的生产更加提高。我们新中国的工人是要不断进步的。
