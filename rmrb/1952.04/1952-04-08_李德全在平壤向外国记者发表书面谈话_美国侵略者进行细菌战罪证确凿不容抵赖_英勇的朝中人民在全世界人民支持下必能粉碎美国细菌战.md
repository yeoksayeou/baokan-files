    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. Li Dequan, head of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Germ Warfare by American Imperialism," issued a written statement to Korean newspapers and foreign journalists stationed in Pyongyang on April 7th. The full text is as follows:

    The "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Germ Warfare by American Imperialism" has been in the heroic, fighting Democratic People's Republic of Korea for more than half a month. During this time, our team members have traveled to the front and rear areas of Korea. Some members participated in the inspection of the germs, insects and various poisons spread by the American aggressors. Some members went in groups to the sites on the eastern and central fronts where the enemy spread germs and insects and dropped germ bombs for on-site investigations, and visited many eyewitnesses and witnesses; some witnesses also met with all our team members and answered our inquiries. Some of our team members also participated in the interrogation of American prisoners of war and special agents sent to investigate the effects of germ warfare. All our team members also listened to reports on epidemic prevention and inspection work in various places, and saw specimens of various insects and poisons dropped by the enemy collected from various places, various types of germ bombs, special shells fired, and various insect containers. From our inspection and investigation, the confessions of enemy prisoners and enemy agents, as well as the epidemic prevention and inspection reports from various places and the various physical evidences provided, the various evidences of the American aggressors carrying out germ warfare on a large scale and universally on the Korean front and in the vast rear areas are very conclusive and cannot be denied in the slightest. After returning to China, we will, together with the various evidences of the American aggressors carrying out germ warfare in Northeast China collected by the Northeast Branch of this investigation team, write a detailed investigation report and accuse the American aggressors of their heinous crimes of destroying humanity and trampling on international law in front of all peace-loving people in the world.

    Today, we came to our closest friend - the heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea's temporary capital - Pyongyang, and saw the people from all walks of life in Pyongyang, which has a fighting tradition, working, living, and studying tenaciously, intensely and happily. The heroic Korean People's Army soldiers are resolutely defending their capital; the staff of the organizations are working in an intense and orderly manner; the workers have brought into play unparalleled creative labor; the students are studying hard to acquire the knowledge to defend and build the motherland; and the women have demonstrated outstanding talents on various fronts. In short, from many aspects, we have seen the various efforts and achievements made by the heroic Korean people under the leadership of their wise leader, General Kim Il-sung, in their unyielding struggle for the independence of their motherland and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world. I congratulate our heroic friends on this outstanding achievement.

    The brutal American aggressors have been severely hit by the heroic Korean People's Army and the outstanding Chinese sons and daughters who make up the Volunteer Army, and their various "advantages" on land and in the air have been successively crushed. When the enemy ran out of tricks and strength, they妄图妄图 to use germ warfare, which is hated by the people of the world, to save its failure. But the enemy's wishful thinking was wrong. The heroic Korean and Chinese people will not be conquered by any violence. Now, all peace-loving people in the world have raised serious protests and righteous condemnations against the criminal acts of American imperialism in carrying out germ warfare. With the staunch struggle of the Korean and Chinese people and the support of the people of the world, we will surely win a brilliant victory against germ warfare!

    李德全在平壤向外国记者发表书面谈话
    美国侵略者进行细菌战罪证确凿不容抵赖
    英勇的朝中人民在全世界人民支持下必能粉碎美国细菌战
    【新华社平壤七日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”团长李德全四月七日向朝鲜各报和驻平壤的外国记者发表书面谈话，全文如下：
    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”来到英雄的战斗的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经有半个多月了。在这半个多月的时间中，我们的团员曾分别到达朝鲜的前方和后方各地，一部分团员参加了对美国侵略者撒布细菌昆虫和各种毒物的检验工作，一部分团员分组到东线及中线敌人撒布细菌昆虫及投掷细菌弹的现场进行了实地调查，访问了许多目击者和见证人；一部分见证人还和我们全体团员见了面，回答了我们的询问。我们部分团员还参加审讯了美军俘虏及其派遣调查细菌战效果的特务。我们全体团员还听取了各地防疫检验工作的报告，看到了各地采选的敌人投掷的各种昆虫毒物的标本、各类的细菌弹、发射的特制炮弹以及各种昆虫容器。从我们的检验调查和敌俘敌特供词，以及各地防疫检验报告与提供的各种物证看来，美国侵略者在朝鲜前线和广大后方大规模地、普遍地进行细菌战的各种罪证已是十分确凿，不容丝毫抵赖。我们在回到中国后，即将会同本调查团东北分团所搜集的美国侵略者在我国东北进行细菌战的各种罪证，写成详细的调查报告书，在全世界一切爱好和平的人民面前，控诉美国侵略者绝灭人性蹂躏国际公法的滔天罪行。
    今天我们来到我们最亲密的友邦——英雄的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都——平壤市，看到有着战斗传统的平壤市各界人民在坚强地紧张地愉快地工作着、生活着和学习着。英雄的朝鲜人民军战士在坚决地捍卫着自己的首都；机关工作人员在紧张而有序地工作着；工人们发挥了无比的创造性的劳动；学生们在奋发地学习着保卫祖国建设祖国的知识；妇女们在各个战线上表现了卓越的才能。总之，从多方面我们看到了英雄的朝鲜人民，在其英明的领袖金日成将军领导下，不屈不挠地为争取祖国独立、为保卫远东和世界和平而作的各种努力和成就。我为我们英雄的友人这种卓越的成就而祝贺。
    残暴的美国侵略者在英雄的朝鲜人民军和优秀的中国儿女组成的志愿军的沉重打击下，在陆上和空中的各种“优势”都相继被粉碎。敌人在技穷力竭之际，妄图以全世界人民痛恨的细菌战来挽救它的失败。但是敌人的如意算盘打错了，英雄的朝中人民是不会被任何暴力征服的。现在，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都对美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪恶行为提出了严重的抗议和正义的声讨。在朝中人民的坚强战斗和全世界人民的支持下，我们必然能获得反细菌战的光辉胜利！
