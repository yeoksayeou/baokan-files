Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from TASS: The entire German people are resolutely demanding the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany on the basis of the proposals put forward in the Soviet government's notes to Western countries. People in various parts of Germany are responding to the call issued by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the German people, protesting Adenauer's attempt to conclude a militaristic "General Treaty" with Western countries.

The Free German Youth League and the German Democratic Women's Federation have both issued statements wholeheartedly welcoming the "Letter to the German People" from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and demanding intensified struggle against the "General Treaty" and for the unification of Germany.

The workers, staff, engineers, and technicians of the Neptune Shipyard in Rostock sent an appeal to the workers of shipyards throughout West Germany, saying: We must stop the shameful conspiracy of the enemies of our people to conclude the "General Treaty". To this end, all German workers must act in unison and use all methods to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany.

Young Socialists in Essen held a meeting to protest the remilitarization policy implemented by the Bonn authorities, and demanded the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany based on the Soviet government's proposals.

Dockworkers in Mannheim also held a meeting, similarly demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany based on the Soviet proposals, and demanding the immediate cessation of Adenauer's negotiations on the so-called "General Treaty." Local metalworkers also held a general meeting, supporting the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany and opposing Adenauer's "General Treaty."

Two thousand workers at the Geisweid metallurgical plant in Hagen demanded that the working people of West Germany hold a general strike to protest Adenauer's attempt to conclude a "General Treaty" with Western countries.
