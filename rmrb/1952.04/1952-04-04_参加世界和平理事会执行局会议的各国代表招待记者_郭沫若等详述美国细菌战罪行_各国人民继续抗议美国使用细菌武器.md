Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 3rd. TASS Dispatch: Representatives from various countries participating in the World Peace Council Executive Bureau meeting held a press conference on the 1st, hosting journalists from Oslo newspapers and foreign press.

Fajee spoke first at the press conference. On behalf of the representatives attending the meeting, he expressed gratitude to the peace fighters of the Norwegian capital and the Oslo Municipal Government for enabling the smooth progress of the meeting. Fajee then issued a statement, pointing out the work and achievements of this meeting.

Li Giyong, representative of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, gave detailed reports to the journalists on the facts of the U.S. aggressors’ criminal germ warfare in Korea and China. Guo Moruo also read aloud a telegram from Shenyang, China, sent to him by members of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, who are investigating this crime by the US intervention troops.

Copies of documents and photos submitted by Guo Moruo and Li Giyong to the World Peace Council Executive Bureau meeting as evidence of the crimes of the U.S. aggressors were distributed to the journalists at the meeting, and newsreel footage about the crimes of the U.S. aggressors using bacteriological weapons was shown.

Representatives attending the Executive Bureau meeting answered many questions raised by the journalists at the press conference.

Finally, Guo Moruo made another brief statement. He said: The Chinese people are peace-loving and desire peace. It is not the Chinese people attacking the United States, but the US intervention troops invading China and committing inhuman crimes in China. Guo Moruo said: For obvious reasons, he cannot now state the number of people who have fallen ill and died as a result of the US intervention troops spreading germs in China. However, even if only a dozen people are infected, all of humanity should angrily protest and stop such crimes of the murderers in order to uphold humanity.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd. The World Peace Council’s "Information Bulletin" has recently continued to publish protests from people around the world against the bacteriological warfare crimes of the U.S. imperialists.

The Secretariat of the Guatemalan National Peace Committee issued a statement saying: "In the face of this inhuman crime that violates international conventions and threatens the people of the whole world, the Secretariat of the Guatemalan National Peace Committee hereby lodges a strong protest and calls on all people in Guatemala who uphold humanity and love peace to denounce this barbaric crime of the U.S. military—the U.S. military has sullied the name and principles of the United Nations, which is responsible for ensuring peace and international security."

General Cardoso, a member of the World Peace Council and a Brazilian peace fighter, said: "The crime of using bacteriological weapons is a blow to the deepest part of human feelings. Countries that use such cruel means of destroying civilians should be condemned by the people of the world."

Brazilian agronomist Fandura published an article saying: "I earnestly appeal to all good people to unite and oppose the outrageous crimes committed by the imperialist aggressors against the heroic Korean people."

Famous Colombian philosopher Cano said: "For the sake of peace and international morality, I support Joliot-Curie's statement against germ warfare."

Bryson, President of the Marine Cooks' and Stewards' Union of the United States, telegraphed the World Peace Council saying: "I am honored to support Joliot-Curie's statement against the U.S. military's germ warfare in Korea and China."

Mrs. Streit, a member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and an Australian peace fighter, said: "Every conscientious person demands an end to this war. All the people of Australia should rise up and demand the withdrawal of all troops invading Korea. All countries participating in this shameful war should save themselves. We can never give the Korean people back their dead children and relatives, but we can return their country to them and help them rebuild their country in a spirit of humanitarianism."

    各国人民继续抗议美国使用细菌武器
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社奥斯陆讯：参加世界和平理事会执行局会议的各国代表，在一日举行记者招待会，招待奥斯陆各报和外国报纸的记者。
    法奇首先在招待会上发言。他代表参加会议的代表们对挪威首都的和平战士和奥斯陆市政府表示谢意，感谢他们使会议能够顺利进行。法奇随即发表声明，指出这次会议的工作和成就。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会代表李箕永和中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若，对记者们详尽地报告了美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行罪恶的细菌战的事实。郭沫若并当场宣读了正在调查美国干涉军这种罪行的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团员从中国沈阳拍给他的一份电报。
    会上向记者们分发了郭沫若和李箕永提交世界和平理事会执行局会议的作为美国侵略者的罪证的文件和照片的副本，并放映了关于美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行的新闻记录影片。
    参加执行局会议的代表们在招待会上答复了记者们所提出的许多问题。
    最后，郭沫若又发表了简短的声明。他说：中国人民是爱好和平、希望和平的。不是中国人民进攻美国，而是美国干涉军侵犯中国，并在中国作出了灭绝人性的罪行。郭沫若说：为了明显的理由，他现在不能说明因美国干涉军在中国散布病菌而罹病死亡的人数。可是，即使只有十几个人受了传染，全人类为了维护人道，也应该忿怒抗议并制止杀人凶犯的这种罪行。
    【新华社布拉格三日电】世界和平理事会的“情况公报”最近几期继续发表世界人民对美帝国主义者细菌战罪行的抗议。
    危地马拉全国和平委员会秘书处发表声明说：“面对着这种惨无人道、破坏国际公约并威胁全世界人民的罪行，危地马拉全国和平委员会秘书处特提出强烈的抗议，并号召危地马拉一切维护人道、爱好和平的人民起来声讨美军这种野蛮的罪行——美军沾污了以保障和平和国际安全为己任的联合国的名称和原则。”
    世界和平理事会理事、巴西和平战士卡多索将军说：“使用细菌武器的罪行，是对人类感情的最深处的一个打击。使用像毁灭平民的这种残酷手段的国家，应该受到全世界人民的声讨。”
    巴西农学家凡杜拉发表文章说：“我恳切地呼吁一切善良的人民团结起来，反对帝国主义侵略者对英勇的朝鲜人民所进行的这种令人发指的罪行。”
    哥伦比亚名哲学家卡诺说：“为了和平、为了国际道义，我支持约里奥—居里反对细菌战的声明。”
    美国海船厨师侍者工会主席勃里逊打电报给世界和平理事会说：“我荣幸地支持约里奥—居里所发表反对美军在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的声明。”
    世界和平理事会执行局委员、澳大利亚和平战士斯崔特夫人说：“每一个有良心的人，都要求停止这个战争。澳大利亚全国人民都应该起来要求撤退一切侵略朝鲜的军队，一切参加这个可耻的战争的国家，都应该挽救自己。我们永远不能使朝鲜人民重新获得他们死去的子女和亲人了，可是我们能够把他们的国家交还他们，能够以人道主义的精神帮助他们重建他们的国家。”
