    Profiteer Wang Xiangchen Writes Letter Acknowledging Mistakes

    Editor: I am a businessman deeply poisoned by the old society. Since liberation, I have also failed to study properly. I am only interested in profit, and I don't care about anything else. In the People's Daily's second page on February 24th, the news "Fu Guangqing Colludes with a Group of Profiteers to Forge Contracts and Defraud Large Amounts of Money" mentioned that "the contract signed with profiteer Wang Xiangchen... not even a single brick was seen." After reading this news, I questioned you and demanded a correction. This was entirely my own fault. The facts exposed by Comrade Zhang Jimin in your newspaper's "Reader's Letter" column on March 15th prove that I was trying to quibble. I bribed and evaded taxes, and I was originally a profiteer; however, I still didn't admit it, and instead questioned you, which is extremely shameful. Now I sincerely apologize to you. I am also willing to work hard to reform and start a new life.

    奸商王相臣来信承认错误
    编辑同志：我是一个受旧社会毒害很深的商人，解放以来我也没有好好学习。我唯利是图，对其他事一概不问。二月二十四日人民日报第二版登载的
    “傅广庆勾结一伙奸商订假合同大量骗款”的消息中，提到“和奸商王相臣订的合同……，也是一砖未见。”我看了这段消息，便向你们追问，并要求更正。这完全是我自己的错误。三月十五日你报“读者来信”栏上张冀民同志揭发的事实，就证明我是企图狡辩。我行贿、漏税，本来是奸商；可是，我还不承认，反而向你们追问，真是可耻之极。现在我恳切地向你们道歉。我并愿努力改造，重新做人。
