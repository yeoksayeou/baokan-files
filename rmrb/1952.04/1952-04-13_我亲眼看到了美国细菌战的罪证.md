    I Personally Witnessed the Evidence of American Bacteriological Warfare
    Shen Qiyi
    I participated in the work of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare" this time. I visited many areas in the Northeast and personally saw the fact that the American beasts spread bacterial poisonous insects on our sacred territory, plotting to kill me and peaceful residents. I also personally saw American planes constantly intruding into our Northeast airspace. Immediately after the enemy planes left, local residents discovered a large number of poisonous insects and poisonous substances. There were many types of poisonous insects dropped by American planes. We personally saw more than 30 kinds of insects such as mosquitoes, flies, spiders, black springtails, crickets, and locusts. Judging from the season of discovery, the location of discovery, and the large and dense situation at the time of discovery, it fully shows that these insects were dropped by American planes. The local residents also unanimously confirmed that it was unprecedented to find so many insects in such cold weather. There were also many kinds of poisons dropped by American planes, including feathers, leaves, and cotton. After detailed research by experts, it was confirmed that these poisonous insects and poisonous substances carry bacteria, fungi, viruses, and rickettsia. These germs and viruses are very harmful to humans, livestock, and crops. All the evidence shows that this disease was spread by the poisonous insects dropped by the American robbers. Although the American imperialists are very cunning and try every means to eliminate the evidence of dropping poisonous insects, such as using night attacks and using poisonous insect containers that are easy to break or burn, we still found the bacterial bombs they dropped. So many ironclad facts fully prove that the heinous crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare are undeniable.
    We must warn the American aggressors: the most vicious and inhumane bacteriological warfare you have adopted cannot save your tragic defeat. This can only make you perish more quickly in the flames of human justice and hatred.
    In the struggle against bacteriological warfare, the responsibility of scientific workers is very important. We must better organize ourselves and accelerate the research work against bacteriological warfare to crush the conspiracy of the American aggressors. We must closely unite with the broad masses and popularize scientific knowledge of insect trapping and epidemic prevention. At the same time, we must accuse the inhumane bacteriological warfare crimes of American imperialism to all kind scientists in the world. In order to maintain human justice and the dignity of science, we must form a broad front with just natural scientists all over the world, and jointly condemn the brutal acts of using science to destroy mankind, and condemn all bacteriological war criminals and all the scum of the scientific community who participate in bacteriological warfare. Natural science workers across the country must stand at the forefront of the fight against bacteriological warfare and demand this blood debt for the victimized Chinese and Korean people.

    我亲眼看到了美国细菌战的罪证
    沈其益
    我这次参加了“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团的工作，在东北访问了很多地区，亲眼看到美国野兽在我们神圣的领土上撒布细菌毒虫，阴谋杀害我和平居民的事实。我并亲眼看到美国飞机不断侵入我东北领空。在敌机离开之后，当地居民马上就发现了大批毒虫毒物。美国飞机所投掷的毒虫种类极多，我们所亲眼看见的就有蚊、蝇、蜘蛛、黑跳虫、蟋蟀、蝗虫等三十多种。从发现的季节，发现的地点和发现时大量密集的情况各方面看，都充分说明这些昆虫是美国飞机投下来的。当地的居民也一致证实，在这样寒冷的天气，发现这样多的昆虫，是亘古未有的事。美国飞机所投的毒物也很多，其中包括羽毛、树叶和棉花等。经过专家们详细研究，确切地证实了这些毒虫毒物是带有细菌、真菌、病毒和立克次氏体。这些病菌病毒对人类，牲畜和农作物有很大的危害性。一切的证据都说明这种疾疫是美国强盗投掷毒虫所传播的。尽管美帝国主义非常狡猾，想尽方法要消灭投掷毒虫的罪证，如利用夜间偷袭，使用容易破碎或容易焚毁的毒虫容器，但是，我们仍然发现了他们投掷下来的细菌弹。这样多的铁的事实，充分证实了美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行是无可抵赖的。
    我们必须警告美国侵略者：你们所采用的最毒辣的灭绝人性的细菌战，是不能挽救你们的惨败的。这只能使你们更快地毁灭在人类正义和仇恨的火焰中。
    在反细菌战的斗争中，科学工作者的责任是十分重大的。我们要更好地组织起来，加速地进行反细菌战的研究工作，粉碎美国侵略者的阴谋诡计。我们要紧密地结合广大群众，普及捕虫和防疫的科学知识。同时我们要向全世界一切善良的科学家控诉美帝国主义灭绝人性的细菌战罪行。为了保持人类的正义和科学的尊严，我们要和全世界正义的自然科学工作者结成一条广阔的战线，一致声讨利用科学来毁灭人类的残暴行为，声讨一切细菌战犯和一切参加细菌战的科学界的败类。全国的自然科学工作者一定要站在反细菌战的最前线，要为受害的中朝人民讨还这笔血债。
