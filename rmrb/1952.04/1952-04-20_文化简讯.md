    Cultural Briefs
    ▲A Chinese musical creation team consisting of Fei Ke, Cao Ke, and nine others, arrived at the Korean front on the 10th of this month. They were warmly welcomed by the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers. The creation team members will soon be dispatched to various units at the front to begin their work.
    ▲Over two thousand two hundred teachers and students from Hunan University who went to the countryside last winter to participate in land reform have returned to the university successively by early April. In order to consolidate the gains from their time in the countryside, all teachers and students conducted a serious and conscientious ideological review, engaging in mutual criticism and self-criticism. Through the practice of land reform, they further recognized the urgent need for ideological remolding and understood that if a higher intellectual and teacher does not eliminate non-working-class ideologies, it will be extremely harmful to the motherland, the people, and the revolutionary cause. Through the tempering of practical struggle, they also gained a clearer understanding of class perspectives, materialist perspectives, mass perspectives, labor perspectives, and organizational perspectives. At the ideological summary and experience exchange meeting, many teachers and students gave vivid reports, criticizing some of their past erroneous views. They unanimously agreed that ideological transformation requires one's own determination. Many students and teachers also expressed their intention to further transform themselves in the upcoming "Three-Anti" movement at the university, strictly criticizing bourgeois ideology and establishing working-class ideology, in order to better serve the people. Li Da, the president of Hunan University, also emphasized at the victorious meeting of the ideological summary that everyone should participate in the "Three-Anti" movement with the spirit of participating in land reform, take a thorough bath in the movement, and wash away all their stains. On April 10, the entire university enthusiastically transitioned into the "Three-Anti" movement.
    ▲The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Store Employees' Union, in order to strengthen political and ideological education for store employee masses and further enhance their political consciousness, established a political study class on April 12. Approximately one thousand two hundred store employees from trade warehouses, hardware, and other industries are participating in the study. The study period is tentatively set for one month, and the courses include a brief history of social development, basic questions of the Chinese revolution, and economic policies.
