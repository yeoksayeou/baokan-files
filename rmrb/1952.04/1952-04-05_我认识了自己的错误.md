    I Recognize My Mistakes
    Fu Ying, Head of the Chemical Engineering Department, Engineering College of Peking University

    Deceived by American imperialism, I once harbored illusions about it. This can be seen from my feelings when I went to the United States and when I returned to Peking University Engineering College. Looking back now, I was such a despicable and hateful person. At the end of 1944, I fled the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to the United States. When I left Chongqing, I thought I was escaping from darkness and heading towards "light." Seeing that the United States was also at war with Japan at the time, I regarded it as a friend of China. When I arrived at the University of Michigan, my teacher, Bartell, treated me extremely warmly, and I was very grateful in my heart. I didn't know that he was using some petty favors to win me over, to buy my feelings, so that I would serve him loyally. He introduced me to live in an American fraternity, and I felt very proud, thinking that I was not an ordinary Chinese. I didn't know that this was Bartell's well-thought-out plan. I helped him guide five graduate students, and until a year ago, I still regarded this as a very glorious thing.

    In early 1949, I once wanted to use my research achievements to obtain a professorship at an American university. At that time, I didn't know whether China could be unified quickly and whether I could continue to do research after returning to China, in order to pursue my only wish in life: to occupy a position in the academic world with my own research achievements.

    In 1949, several friends wrote letters to persuade me to return to China. After much ideological struggle, I returned to my motherland. On the way back, on the one hand, I worried about my motherland with a doubtful and uncertain mood, and on the other hand, I was reluctant to leave the United States. When a certain Mr. invited me to work in the Chemistry Department of Peking University, I was not excited. I only thought about my own research and the so-called academic status and glory that came from research. I thought that the equipment of the Chemistry Department of Peking University was not as good as that of the University of Michigan, and the level of graduate students might not be as good as that of Michigan, which would only be bad for my future. I believed that only contributions in academics were valuable, and only the position of authority in the academic world was glorious. I didn't understand that the value of academic contributions completely depended on whether they were useful to the motherland. When I arrived at the Engineering College of Peking University, my mood was not as enthusiastic as when I walked into the Chemistry Building of the University of Michigan. Seeing that our laboratory equipment was far inferior to the Michigan that I had been thinking about, and that research could not be carried out in a short period of time, I felt very disappointed. On my first day at the school, I thought about how to leave the Engineering College of Peking University; while in Michigan, I was only afraid of leaving. My "sojourner mentality" seriously affected the development of the Chemical Engineering Department.

    Because I was won over by Bartell's petty favors, and because I published ten papers in the United States in five years, which made me climb a step in the academic world, I developed feelings for American imperialism and couldn't forget it, while rarely thinking that it was our mortal enemy. For example, at the welcoming party last year, I, as the head of the department, mistakenly promoted how good the Chemical Engineering Department of Michigan was and how bad our Chemical Engineering Department was. This dampened the enthusiasm of the second-year students, and they asked to transfer to other departments.

    My pro-American thinking not only turned me into a loudspeaker that couldn't distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, constantly spreading poison to colleagues and students, but also made me commit serious mistakes in school administrative work. For example, my worship of American imperialism's "genius education" theory made some students feel inferior and reduced their enthusiasm for learning; also, the money-worshiping thinking I brought back from the United States made me want more funding, thus fostering waste. There is a kind of person in China called "superior Chinese," who, although they are Chinese who have received higher education, are full of the decadent ideas of European and American capitalism and feelings for American imperialism in their bones. I am such a person.

    I want to accuse American imperialism. Bartell used my desire for fame and gave me some petty favors, which made me serve American imperialism loyally for five years. He not only bought my labor, but also bought my feelings. Regardless of winter or summer, I worked all day, neglecting sleep and forgetting food, to produce papers for him. I trained five or six high-level talents for American imperialism, and they are now doing things that harm our motherland. I have been supported by the people of the motherland for decades, but not only have I failed to defend the motherland, but I have directly and indirectly helped the enemy. This is the evil consequence of Bartell turning me into a slave of American imperialism with petty favors.

    In 1950, I returned to the motherland and received preferential treatment from the people of the motherland. How warm was the motherland's feelings for me, and how ardent was the motherland's hope for me, but I not only made no contribution to the motherland, but also acted as an unpaid propagandist for American imperialism in the school, spreading poison for American imperialism to harm our motherland's most precious youth.

    So, what kind of ideological influence did the reactionary education of American imperialism have on me? My views on democracy are entirely from the perspective of the British and American bourgeoisie. I believe that a democratic polity must have two political parties that oppose and supervise each other. After returning to China, seeing that we actually had no opposition party, I felt that this was not democracy but autocracy. When electing the mayor and members of the municipal government of Beijing, the number of candidates on the final list was the same as the number of members. At that time, I felt that since it was an election, the number of candidates should not be the same as the number of members, otherwise I could not exercise my right to vote. Therefore, I felt disappointed. But I didn't know that this kind of detailed discussion first, and then deciding on candidates, was a sign of being responsible to the people, and this was true democracy.

    Based on my understanding of British and American political parties and the Kuomintang, I used to think that "a party is an organization that seeks the interests of a certain group." This view is completely applicable to bourgeois political parties. But my most serious mistake was thinking that "the Communist Party is also like this." I didn't recognize that what the Communist Party represents is the interests of the working class, which is also the interests of the people of the whole country. After returning to China and seeing the many great achievements of the motherland's construction, I certainly admitted that the Communist Party was a good political party, but I didn't dare to believe that the Communist Party could always be so good, so I had the absurd idea of "history taking a hundred years to see."

    After returning to China, I thought: the People's Government adopted a tolerant attitude towards people like me because the Communist Party did not have enough technical talents. When the Communist Party had more technical talents, I would be eliminated. Therefore, I must regard myself as an employee of the government. If there was something more in line with my interests than Peking University, I would go there. I always regarded myself as an outsider, waiting to be eliminated. With this mentality, I naturally had a negative attitude and always looked at the People's Government with a cold eye; at the same time, when I encountered things that did not meet my ideals, I would complain a few words. Now, I recognize my mistakes. I completely misunderstood the People's Government's care and concern for technical personnel. The reason why I was negative in my work and looked at the People's Government with a cold eye was because I lacked a sense of ownership and because I lacked the qualities that a people's teacher should have.

    When the "Three-Anti" movement began, I thought that carrying out the "Three-Anti" in the school would only increase my troubles and would not have any other effect, so I was not active in the "Three-Anti" movement. It wasn't until I saw the exhibition of waste in the Engineering College that I was awakened and realized how much evil could be caused by the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie. When I examined my own decadent ideas, I further understood the significance of this movement. With the help of comrades, I discovered in preparing my second self-criticism that there were many unspeakable thoughts hidden in the depths of my heart. Now I have completely understood the significance of this movement and realized that only the People's Government led by the Communist Party can truly launch and lead this movement. In the "Three-Anti" movement, I saw my true face. I experienced revolutionary friendship and the sincere feelings of comrades, which made me deeply realize that it is glorious to be a people's teacher. I thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for bringing me out of hell and into the light in this great movement.

    我认识了自己的错误
    北京大学工学院  化工系系主任  傅鹰
    因为受了美帝国主义的欺骗，我曾对美帝国主义有过幻想。这从我去美国和回国到北京大学工学院时的心情，就可以看出来。现在想来，我是一个多么可卑可恨的人。一九四四年底我逃出蒋匪帮的统治去美国了。离开重庆时，我想着这次脱离了黑暗，走向了“光明”。我看见当时美国也和日本作战，就拿它当作中国的朋友。到了米西干大学，我的老师巴特尔待我极其殷勤，我心里便非常感激。我不知道他正在用一些小恩小惠来拉拢我，来收买我的感情，好忠心为他服务。他介绍我到一个美国兄弟会中去住，我心里觉得很骄傲，认为我不是一个平凡的中国人。我不知道这正是巴特尔的深思远虑。我帮他指导过五个研究生，直到一年前我还把这件事当作一件很光荣的事。
    一九四九年初，我曾经一度想借研究的成绩取得美国大学教授的地位。那时我不知道中国能否很快统一，回国后是否能继续作研究，以追求我一生唯一的愿望：凭自己的研究成绩在学术界占个地位。
    一九四九年有几个朋友写信来劝我回国，我经过许多的思想斗争，才回到祖国来。在归程中，我一方面以怀疑不定的心情惦念祖国，一方面又以不舍的情绪留恋美国。当某先生约我在北京大学化学系工作时，我并不感到兴奋，我只想到自己的研究以及由研究而来的所谓学术界的地位和光荣。我想北京大学化学系的设备，不如米西干大学，研究生的程度未必能比得上米西干，这对于我的前途只会坏不会好的。我认为只有在学术上的贡献才是有价值的，只有学术界权威的地位才是光荣的。我不懂得学术上的贡献有无价值，完全决定于是否对于祖国有用处。当我到了北京大学工学院时，情绪远不如走进米西干大学化学馆时那么热烈。看见我们的实验室设备远不如我所念念不忘的米西干，在短期间不能进行研究，我因此而感觉到十分失望。我到校的第一天，就想如何才能离开北京大学工学院；而在米西干时却只恐怕离开。我这样的“作客思想”严重地影响了化工系的发展。
    因为被巴特尔的小恩小惠所笼络，又因为在五年中在美国发表了十篇论文，使我在学术界向上爬了一步，因此我就对美帝国主义发生了感情，念念不忘，而很少想到它是我们的死对头。如去年在迎新会上，我竟以系主任的资格错误地宣传米西干的化工系如何如何好，我们的化工系如何如何不好。因此打击了二年级同学的情绪，他们纷纷要求转系。
    我的崇美思想不但使我变成了敌我不分的肉喇叭，不断地向同仁同学散布毒素，也使我在学校行政工作上犯了严重的错误。例如我崇拜美帝国主义的“天才教育”理论，使某些同学产生了自卑感，学习情绪降低；又如我从美国带回来的拜金思想，使我想法多要经费，因而助长了浪费。中国有一种人叫“高等华人”，他们虽然是受过高等教育的中国人，骨子里却充满了欧美资本主义的腐朽思想和对美帝国主义的感情，我就是这样的一个人。
    我要控诉美帝国主义。巴特尔利用我求名的愿望，施一些小恩小惠，使我为美帝国主义忠心耿耿地服务了五年。他不仅买了我的劳力，还买了我的感情。我不分冬夏，整天工作，废寝忘食地为他制造论文。我为美帝国主义训练了五、六个高级人材，他们现正在做危害我们祖国的事。我被祖国人民养活了几十年，不但不能捍卫祖国，反而直接间接帮助了敌人。这是巴特尔以小恩小惠将我变成了美帝国主义的奴隶的恶果。
    一九五○年我回到祖国，受到祖国人民的优待，祖国对于我的感情是如何热烈，对我的希望是如何的殷切，而我却不但对于祖国毫无贡献，反而在学校中作了美帝国主义的义务宣传员，替美帝国主义散布毒素来害我们祖国最宝贵的青年。
    那末，美帝国主义的反动教育给我一些什么思想影响呢？我对于民主的见解完全是英美资产阶级的观点。我认为一个民主的政体必须有两个政党，互相反对，互相监视。回国后看见我们实际上并没有反对党，就觉得这不是民主而是专制。在选举北京市的市长及市人民政府委员时，最后的候选人名单上的人数和委员数目一样，那时我就觉得既然是选举，候选人的人数就不应当和委员人数一样，否则就不能运用我的选举权了。因此我感到失望。而不知道这种先行详细讨论，然后决定候选人，正是表示对人民负责，这才是真正民主。
    根据我对于英美政党及国民党的认识，从前我总以为“党是为某一个集团谋利益的组织”。这种见解对于资产阶级政党是完全适用的。但是我的最严重错误是认为“共产党也是如此”。我不认识共产党所代表的是工人阶级的利益，也即是全国人民的利益。回国后见着祖国建设的许多伟大成绩，我当然承认共产党是好的政党，但不敢相信共产党就能够永远这们好，因此就发生了“历史看百年”的谬想。
    回国后我想：人民政府对于像我这样的人采取容忍的态度，是因为共产党的技术人材不够，等到共产党技术人材多了，我就要被淘汰了。因此必须将自己当作政府的雇员，若是别处有比北京大学更合乎我的兴趣的事情，我就到那里去。我总是以第三者自居，等着淘汰。有了这种心情，自然态度消极，对于人民政府总是冷眼旁观；同时遇到不合乎我的理想之事时，就发几句牢骚。现在，我认识了自己的错误。我完全不理解人民政府爱护和关心技术人员的心意。我所以工作消极，对人民政府冷眼旁观，是由于我缺乏主人翁的观念，是由于我缺乏人民教师应该具有的品质。
    “三反”运动开始时，我想学校中搞“三反”，除了给我增加麻烦外，没有其他什么作用，因此我对“三反”运动一直不积极。一直到看见工学院的浪费展览时，才吓醒了，才知道资产阶级的腐朽思想能够造成多么大的恶果。到了检讨自己的腐朽思想时，才进一步了解了这个运动的意义。经过同志们的帮助，我在准备第二次检讨时又发现在我心底深处藏了许多见不得人的思想，到现在我才彻底明了了这个运动的意义，才体会到只有共产党领导的人民政府才能真正地展开和领导这个运动。在“三反”运动中，我照见了我自己的真面目。我体会了革命的友爱，同志们的真挚感情，使我深深体会到作一个人民教师是光荣的。我感谢毛主席和共产党在这个伟大的运动中，将我带出地狱，见到光明。
