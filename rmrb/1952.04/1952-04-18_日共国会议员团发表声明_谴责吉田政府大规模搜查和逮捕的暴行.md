    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese Communist Party parliamentary group issued a statement on March 28th, denouncing the Yoshida reactionary government's atrocities of mass searches and arrests on March 28th.
    The statement said: The Yoshida reactionary government forcibly searched and sealed off 1,800 locations nationwide on March 28th, and also arrested many patriots. This is clearly a political conspiracy by the Yoshida reactionary government. Because the war policies of reactionary forces at home and abroad have reached a dead end all over the world, they are even more eager to rearm Japan in order to recover from their defeat on the Korean battlefield.
    The statement continued: The traitorous "Administrative Agreement" destroys all freedom and life of the Japanese people, forcing them to participate in the war and act as slaves. In order to suppress all resistance from the people, the reactionaries have formulated the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." The suppression on March 28th was the first wave of this reactionary offensive. The Japanese people clearly know what is hidden behind this conspiracy and what is to come. Now the Japanese people must do everything in their power to strive for peace and independence, in order to defend the land and people of their motherland. This is the sacred right of the Japanese nation.
    The statement concluded: The people of Japan will never give up the struggle because of the frantic suppression of March 28th. We will muster more courage and rise up to fight to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, oppose rearmament, abolish the "Administrative Agreement," and fight for national liberation.

    日共国会议员团发表声明
    谴责吉田政府大规模搜查和逮捕的暴行
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团于三月二十八日发表声明，斥责吉田反动政府三月二十八日的大规模搜查和逮捕的暴行。
    声明说：吉田反动政府在三月二十八日强行搜索并查封全国一千八百处地方，还逮捕了许多爱国人士。这显然是吉田反动政府的政治阴谋。因为，国内外反动势力的战争政策在全世界都走到了穷途末路，它们为要挽回其在朝鲜战场上的失败，更加迫切地要求重新武装日本。
    声明接着说：卖国的“行政协定”破坏日本国民的一切自由和生活，强制日本人民参加战争和充当奴隶。反动派为了镇压人民对它的一切反抗，制订了“防止破坏活动法案”。三月二十八日的镇压正是这个反动攻势的头一阵。日本国民明确地知道这一阴谋背后隐藏着的是什么和今后将要到来的是什么。现在日本国民要竭尽全力争取和平与独立，以保卫自己祖国的土地和人民，这是日本民族的神圣权利。
    声明最后说：日本全国人民决不因三月二十八日的疯狂镇压而放弃斗争。我们将要更加鼓起勇气，奋起进行打倒吉田内阁、反对重整军备、废除“行政协定”和民族解放的斗争。
