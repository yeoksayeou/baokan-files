To Stop Plague, the Breeding Ground of Plague Must Be Eradicated!
People of the World Demand an End to American Bacteriological Warfare
The Soviet People Continue to Hold Mass Rallies Expressing Extreme Indignation at American Bacteriological Warfare

[News from This Newspaper] Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: Countless protest rallies are being held all over the Soviet Union. The Soviet people are also expressing their indignant protests in newspapers. They severely denounce the towering crimes of the American imperialists and demand the protection of mankind from the scourge of bacteriological warfare.

The working people of Arkhangelsk Oblast expressed extreme hatred and indignation at America's use of abominable weapons. Female worker Yevdokimova said at a staff meeting at the Arkhangelsk Sawmill: The American devils want to destroy the freedom-loving people of Korea and China. But their despicable plans will never be realized. All peace-loving people shout: "No interference in Korea and China!" "Down with bacteriological warfare!"

The evil deeds of the American interventionists have aroused deep anger among the working people of the Chuvash Autonomous Republic. Female worker Spasova said at an electrical appliance factory meeting: "We Soviet women, together with women all over the world, protest the crimes of the American cannibals. We demand severe punishment for these criminals!"

Village doctor Gugory of Velyki Budyshcha village in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine, wrote in "Komsomolskaya Pravda": "Every honest person cannot help but be shocked by the atrocities of the American cannibals. As a doctor, I am particularly aware of the terrible nature of these crimes. American scientists and doctors have become accomplices in the crime of spreading terrible diseases to massacre people on a large scale. These cannibals have used medicine, a science that saves human lives, to create death." Gugory continued: "To stop the plague, the breeding ground of the plague must be eradicated. The will of the people of the world demands that the American aggressors be stopped, that bacteriological warfare be ended, and that war criminals be punished."

Joint Statement by Prominent Korean Literary and Art Workers Calling for an End to the American Aggressors' Bacteriological Warfare

Thirty-three prominent Korean literary and art workers, including Han Sorya, Lee Tae-jun, Lim Hwa, Kim Nam-cheon, An Ki-ok, Mun Ye-bong, Sim Young, Hwang Chol, and Shin Ko-song, issued a joint statement on March 30, saying: American cannibals have turned our peaceful cities and villages into ruins, brutally killing our parents, brothers, and sisters. Today, they are even trying to turn our rear areas into a dead zone of terrible infectious diseases and death. This fully exposes the hideous faces of the Wall Street war profiteers and their servants, who suck the people's blood to enrich themselves and create human disasters, misfortune, and suffering to make money. This death struggle of the American cannibals will never reverse the defeat of their war of aggression against Korea. The heinous crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea will absolutely not weaken the fighting power of the Korean people, but will only lead to a more disastrous defeat for the aggressors themselves and further expose their crimes before the people of the world. We, the literary and art workers of Korea, together with all the Korean people, are determined to unite more closely around our leader and the Republic government, thoroughly expose, denounce, and shatter all the enemy's criminal aggressive conspiracies, and send the enemy to its grave. The statement concluded: The Korean literary and art workers, who will forever stand in the battle ranks of defending peace and freedom, call on all kind people who cherish human culture around the world to further expose and denounce the heinous crimes of American cannibals in using the scientific achievements of all mankind to create weapons to slaughter mankind. We call on all peace-loving people around the world to quickly stop the most barbaric bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors and punish the commanders of this crime, Truman, Acheson, Ridgway, and other American warmongers, as the most ferocious enemies of mankind and as war criminals. The American aggressors must remember the saying "Those who play with fire will be burned." They must know that a new Nuremberg Tribunal awaits them.

People in India and Pakistan Hold Rallies to Protest the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by the American Aggressors

The crimes of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China are increasingly arousing hatred and indignation among the people of India and Pakistan. According to a TASS report from New Delhi: People in Burdwan (in West Bengal province) and Bangalore held rallies to protest the barbaric acts of the US military in Korea. Many protest rallies were also held in Calcutta. The progressive weekly "Nava Lokam," published in Travancore-Cochin, said: If Indian democrats do not now strongly protest these crimes, American robbers will use the same weapons against other Asian peoples. The Indian government must protest to the US government against the latter's crimes. The newspaper added: The United States wants to obstruct the armistice negotiations with its crimes in Korea. The Calcutta progressive newspaper "Deshabandhu" published a statement by S.A. Dange, chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, saying: The policies pursued by the Americans in Korea are even more barbaric than those pursued by the German fascists. The American ruling clique, the enemy of the Asian people and the enemy of all mankind, has used these war methods after concluding that they cannot conquer the Korean people in open struggle. He called on all good people and peace fighters to resolutely protest the Americans' actions in order to protect the lives of Korean men, women and children. "Freedom" reported: Scientists in Calcutta strongly protested the actions of American imperialists in Korea at a gathering held at the University of Calcutta.

According to a TASS report from Karachi: The Karachi Peace Committee held a press conference in Karachi on March 28 to condemn American imperialism's use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people. Peace Committee Chairman Bakhshi issued a statement saying: The American aggressors' bacteriological warfare in Korea surpasses all the atrocities they have committed in the past. Bakhshi emphasized that the American aggressors will not be able to deny the accusations against them. According to materials in American newspapers, the United States has been researching bacteriological weapons for a long time. The American imperialists protect Japanese war criminals so that they can carry out research on bacteriological weapons. Bakhshi said that the Karachi Peace Committee supports all people's organizations protesting this latest crime of the American imperialists. The Peace Committee calls on all freedom-loving countries to demand that the use of atomic and bacteriological weapons be declared illegal.

The German Democratic Women's League Issues a Statement Against the Spreading of Germs by American Imperialists

The National Secretariat of the German Democratic Women's League issued a statement on behalf of German women and mothers, saying: "We abhor and hate the American imperialists who spread bacteria of infectious diseases such as cholera and typhus; by committing this crime, the American imperialists have clearly exposed themselves as war criminals who are enemies of all peace-loving people. The activities carried out by the American imperialists in Korea clearly prove that they plan to launch a Third World War, destroy prosperous cities and peaceful villages, and massacre lively and lovely children and hard-working men and women."

The German Democratic Women's League also sent a telegram to US President Truman protesting the US use of bacteriological weapons. The telegram pointed out that Truman should bear full responsibility for the inhumane killing of Korean women, children, the elderly, and heroic fighters. The telegram said: "We demand an immediate end to the criminal war in Korea and a peaceful solution to the German question based on the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany."

    朝鲜著名的文学艺术工作者韩雪野、李泰俊、林和、金南天、安基玉、文艺峰、沈影、黄澈、申鼓颂等三十三人，在三月三十日联名发表声明说：美国吃人生番已把我国的和平城市和乡村变成了废墟，残暴地杀害了我们的父母、兄弟、姐妹、今天它更妄图把我们的后方变成流行可怕的传染病和死亡的绝境，这完全暴露了华尔街的战争贩子们及其仆从们吸食人民膏血以自肥、制造人类灾祸不幸和痛苦以发财的狰狞面貌。美国吃人生番的这种垂死挣扎，决不可能挽回其侵朝战争的败局；美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，绝对削弱不了朝鲜人民的战斗力量，而只能招致侵略者自己更惨重的失败，并在全世界人民面前进一步暴露它们的罪恶。我们朝鲜的文学艺术工作者和全朝鲜人民一道，决心更紧密地团结在我们的领袖和共和国政府的周围，彻底揭露、声讨和粉碎敌人的一切罪恶的侵略阴谋，把敌人送进坟墓去。声明最后说：永远站在保卫和平与自由的战斗队伍里的朝鲜文学艺术工作者，呼吁全世界一切爱护人类文化的善良人士进一步揭露和声讨美国吃人生番利用全人类的科学成果来制造屠杀人类的武器的万恶罪行；我们呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民迅速制止美国侵略者所进行的最野蛮的细菌战争，并把这种罪行的指挥者杜鲁门、艾奇逊、李奇微等美国战争贩子当作人类最凶恶的敌人，当作战争罪犯来加以惩办。美国侵略者必须牢记“玩火者必自焚”这句格言，它们必须知道：新的纽伦堡法庭在等待着他们。
    印度和巴基斯坦人民举行集会抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器
    美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪行日益引起印度和巴基斯坦人民的憎恨和愤慨。据塔斯社新德里消息：布得温（在西孟加拉省）和班加罗尔地方的人民举行集会，抗议美军在朝鲜的野蛮行为。加尔各答的人民也举行了许多次抗议集会。在特拉凡哥尔—柯钦邦出版的进步周刊“那瓦·洛卡姆”说：如果印度民主人士现在不对这些罪行表示坚决抗议，美国强盗将对亚洲其他人民使用同样的武器。印度政府必须向美国政府抗议后者的罪行。该报又说：美国想以其在朝鲜干出的罪行阻挠停战谈判。加尔各答进步报纸“德沙勃希玛尼”刊载了全印总工会主席夏狄亚的谈话说：美国人在朝鲜奉行的政策，比德国法西斯分子所奉行的政策还要野蛮。亚洲人民的敌人和全人类的敌人美国统治集团，在得出他们无法在公开的斗争中征服朝鲜人民的结论以后，就使用了这些战争手段。他号召一切善良人民与和平战士，为了保护朝鲜男女儿童的生命，坚决抗议美国人的这种行为。“自由报”报道：加尔各答科学家在加尔各答大学举行的一次集会上，强烈抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜的行为。

    德国民主妇女联合会并拍电报给美国总统杜鲁门，抗议美国使用细菌武器。电文指出，杜鲁门对于惨无人道地杀害朝鲜妇女、儿童、老年人和英勇的战士，应该负完全责任。电文说：“我们要求立即终止朝鲜的罪恶战争，并根据苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议和平解决德国问题。”
