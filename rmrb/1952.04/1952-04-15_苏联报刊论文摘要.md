    Party Work in Enterprises
    The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on March 20th discussing how to improve Party work in enterprises. The abstract is as follows:

    The work of each enterprise largely depends on the work of its Party organization. Therefore, in the struggle to implement production plans and educate the masses with a communist attitude towards labor, no slackening is permissible.

    The main tasks of the Party committee in an enterprise are: to tirelessly improve the level of the Party's organizational and political work, to study the enterprise's economic work more deeply, to mobilize the masses to fulfill state plans, to carry out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and to cultivate a communist attitude towards labor. At present, the issues of educating Party members and probationary members in the spirit of observing Party and state discipline, enhancing their advanced role in production, and strengthening the Marxist-Leninist cultivation of communists have been brought before Party organizations, requiring concentrated attention to be resolved.

    To successfully achieve these tasks, Party committees in factories must comprehensively strengthen Party work, improve the work of Party meetings, systematically inspect the implementation of resolutions passed by Party meetings, and promote the initiative and activeness of Party members and the masses. The responsibilities of the secretaries of Party committees and other staff members are to go to the workshops more frequently, to contact communists and non-Party members, to help the secretaries of Party organizations in various workshops to improve Party work, to launch socialist production competitions, and to conduct political and ideological education for workers, engineers, technicians, and other intellectuals.

    In today's environment, improving the working ability of Party workers is of great significance. In adhering to mastering the art of Party leadership, the secretaries of Party committees and other workers should always care about improving the working ability of the secretaries of workshop Party organizations. The Party committee should systematically hold seminars and meetings for workshop Party secretaries with the participation of Party group leaders, regularly listen to reports from workshop secretaries at Party committee meetings, and help them implement Party resolutions.

    In the life of the Party organization in the factory, the Party group occupies an important position. The task of the Party committee is to tirelessly improve the leadership of Party group leaders, and strive to make every Party group actively fight to complete the production tasks of its department, become the initiators of production competitions, and carry out political work among non-Party workers.

    Party committees must pay special attention to the preparation and holding of workers' meetings, the selection of propagandists and the leadership of propaganda work, and the improvement of factory newspapers and wall newspapers. It is absolutely intolerable if Party, trade union, and economic leaders do not actively participate in workers' meetings and propaganda work, and entrust political reports, talks, and reports to people who are not sufficiently politically cultivated. Conducting political work among the masses regularly is the primary responsibility of every leader.

    Party committees should always care about improving cultural and recreational facilities for workers, improving the work of public canteens, cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, and red corners, caring about the implementation of construction plans for dormitories and cultural life, and the development of amateur art activities and sports. In carrying out these measures, it must be ensured that trade unions and the Communist Youth League actively participate.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    企业中的党的工作
    苏联真理报三月二十日发表了论述如何做好党在企
    业中的工作的社论。摘要如下：
    每一个企业的工作，大多决定于它的党组织的工作。因此，在争取执行生产计划、教育群众用共产主义的态度对待劳动的斗争中，任何松懈都是不能容许的。
    企业中的党委员会的主要任务就是：不倦地提高党的组织工作和政治工作的水平，更深入地研究企业的经济工作，动员群众完成国家计划，开展布尔什维克的批评和自我批评，并培养对劳动的共产主义态度。目前以遵守党和国家纪律的精神教育党员和候补党员的布尔什维克教育问题和提高他们在生产中的先进作用并加强共产党员的马列主义修养的问题，已被提到党组织的面前，要求集中注意来予以解决。
    要成功地实现这些任务，各工厂的党委员会就必须全面地加强党内工作，改善党的会议工作，有系统地检查党的会议所通过的决议的执行情况，并发扬党员群众的积极性和主动性。党委员会的书记和其他工作人员的职责则是要更经常地到车间中去，和共产党员、非党人员接触，帮助各车间的党组织书记来改善党的工作、开展社会主义生产竞赛，并对工人及工程师技术人员等知识分子进行政治思想教育。
    在今天的环境下，提高党的工作者的工作能力有着重要的意义。党委员会的书记和其他工作者在坚持掌握党的领导艺术中，应当经常关怀提高车间党组织书记的工作能力。党委员会应当有系统地举行有党小组长参加的车间党组织书记的习明纳尔和会议，定期听取各车间书记在党委员会会议上的报告，并帮助他们来实现党的决议。
    在工厂的党组织的生活中，党的小组占有着重要的地位。党委员会的任务是，不倦地改进对党的小组长的领导，努力使每一个党小组都积极地为争取完成本部门的生产任务而斗争，都成为生产竞赛的发起者并在非党工人中进行政治工作。
    党委员会对工人会议的准备和举行、对选拔鼓动员和领导鼓动工作、对工厂报纸和壁报工作的改进等，必须予以特别注意。如果党的、职工会的和经济方面的领导人不积极参加工人会议和鼓动工作，而把做政治报告、谈话和报道交给政治修养不够的人，是绝不能容忍的。经常在群众中进行政治工作是每
    一个领导者的首要责任。
    党委员会应当经常关怀改善职工文化生活设施，关怀改进公共食堂、文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆和红角的工作，关怀宿舍和文化生活方面的建筑计划的执行情况以及业余艺术活动和体育的发展。在进行这些措施时，并须保证职工会和共青团的积极参加。
