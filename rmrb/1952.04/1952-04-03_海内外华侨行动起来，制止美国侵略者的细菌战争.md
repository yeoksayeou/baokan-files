    Overseas Chinese at Home and Abroad, Take Action to Stop the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare
    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party
    The American imperialists, disregarding international conventions and human morality, have brazenly used bacteriological weapons on a large scale in Korea and our Northeast and Qingdao, Shandong. This shameless and bloody crime shows that they are not only trying to make a desperate struggle to eliminate the majority of the people of China and Korea and expand the Far East war, but also want to use this to intimidate the peace-loving people of all countries in the world. This heinous crime of the American aggressors has not only failed to intimidate the people of China and Korea and the people of the world, but has instead aroused great anger and strong condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world.
    In order to expand its war of aggression, the American imperialists established a Biological Warfare Committee as early as 1942. As soon as World War II ended, the American imperialists deliberately released Japanese bacteriological war criminals such as Shiro Ishii and others, painstakingly cultivating and raising them to become tools for manufacturing bacteriological weapons. The cruel atrocities of the American invading army are resented by the whole world. Facts have proved that hundreds and thousands of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front have become victims in bacteriological weapons testing centers. Now American imperialism is expanding the flames of bacteriological warfare. This shows that the American imperialist bacteriological war criminals are following the old path of Japanese imperialism and Japanese bacteriological war criminals. If they are unrepentant until their death, then their final fate will only be the same as that of Japanese imperialism and Japanese bacteriological war criminals.
    In protest against this shameless crime of the American aggressors, our party, together with the democratic parties led by the Communist Party of China, has made a solemn statement. We have issued a solemn call to all peace-loving people in Asia and the world (including the American people and the Japanese people) and all organizations fighting for peace: The heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors are not only a serious threat to human security, but also an extreme insult to human security. The disaster that fell on the heads of the peaceful people of Korea yesterday has already fallen on the heads of the peaceful people of China today. If the heinous crimes of the American imperialists are not immediately and effectively stopped, the same disaster will inevitably fall on the heads of the peace-loving people of the world tomorrow. For the sake of human dignity and world peace, we must rise up and unanimously condemn the American imperialists and impose the most severe sanctions on the warmongers.
    This call has been widely supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Peace-loving people all over the world have roared and the call to condemn American imperialism for using bacteriological weapons has resounded throughout the world.
    We call on returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in China to expand propaganda against bacteriological warfare and mobilize the masses of overseas Chinese throughout the country to resolutely fight to eradicate bacteriological warfare. At the same time, we call on overseas Chinese to take action to support the motherland's struggle against the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialism and to support the surging tide of protests from people all over the world. It must be pointed out that the combination of the strength of all overseas Chinese and the people of the motherland is a powerful and invincible force. Together with the world's united front of peace and democracy, we will definitely be able to stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors and be able to stop this bloody act of mass slaughter of our motherland's people and the Korean people. We call on overseas Chinese and the people of the motherland to unite with the people of the world. There is no doubt that justice belongs to us, and victory also belongs to us!

    海内外华侨行动起来，制止美国侵略者的细菌战争
    中国致公党主席　陈其尤
    美帝国主义者不顾国际公约和人类道德，竟在朝鲜和我国东北及山东青岛等地大规模使用细菌武器，这种无耻的血腥罪行，说明它不但是妄想借此来作垂死的挣扎，企图消灭中朝大多数的人民，扩大远东战争；同时，它还想借此恫吓全世界爱好和平的各国人民。美国侵略者这种滔天罪行，不但没有吓倒中朝人民及世界人民，相反的引起了全世界爱好和平人民极大的愤怒和严厉的谴责。
    美帝国主义者为了扩大侵略战争，远在一九四二年就成立了生物作战委员会，第二次世界大战一告结束，美帝国主义就有意释放日本细菌战犯石井四郎等罪魁，苦心培植豢养，成为制造细菌武器的工具。美国侵略军的残酷暴行是举世嫉愤的，事实证明：在朝鲜前线成百成千的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，在细菌武器的试验所中成了牺牲者，现在美帝国主义正在扩大细菌战争的毒焰。这说明美帝国主义细菌战犯正在走着日本帝国主义和日本细菌战犯的老路，如果它至死不悟，那么它们最后的结局也就只有和日本帝国主义和日本细菌战犯的结局一样。
    为抗议美国侵略者这一无耻罪行，本党曾与中国共产党为首的各民主党派共同作过庄严的声明，我们已向全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民（包括美国人民和日本人民在内）及所有为和平而奋斗的组织发出庄严的号召：美国侵略者所犯下的滔天罪行不仅是人类安全的严重威胁，而且是人类安全的极端污辱。昨天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，今天已经落到中国和平人民的头上了。对美帝国主义者的滔天罪行如不立即加以有效的制止，同样的灾难，明天必将落到全世界和平人民的头上。为了人类的尊严，为了世界的和平，我们必须奋起对美国帝国主义者一致声讨，并对战争贩子予以最严厉的制裁。
    这号召已普遍得到世界和平人类的支持，全世界和平人民已怒吼起来了，谴责美帝国主义使用细菌武器的呼声，响彻了全世界。
    我们号召国内的归侨侨眷，扩大反细菌战的宣传，把全国华侨群众动员起来，为扑灭细菌战而坚决斗争。同时我们号召海外华侨行动起来，支持祖国反对美帝国主义使用细菌武器的斗争，支持世界人民怒潮澎湃的抗议。必须指出：全体海外华侨和祖国人民力量结合，是一支强大无敌的力量，加上世界和平民主统一战线，一定能够制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行，而且能够制止这种大规模屠杀我们祖国人民及朝鲜人民的血腥行动，我们号召海外华侨和祖国人民与世界人民团结一起。毫无疑问，正义是属于我们的，胜利亦是属于我们的！
