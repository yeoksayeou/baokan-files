    -- Introducing the Situation of the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative, and the Jieying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Li Decun Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team Concluding "Combined Contracts"
    Li Zheren

    In the past two years, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of North China have had many innovations and typical examples in their combination with agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural production mutual aid teams. This kind of combination is a very effective measure to guide the vast and scattered small producers towards collectivization, and it is worth greatly promoting. Now, the situations of the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijiazuo Village, the first district of Boye County, Hebei Province, and the Li Decun Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team in Jieying Village, the third district, signing "combined contracts" with the local supply and marketing cooperatives are introduced as follows:

    The Situation of the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Boye and the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative Concluding a "Combined Contract"

    The Shijiazuo Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was organized in 1947 under the leadership and help of the local People's Government, based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. However, due to unclear guidelines, lax labor discipline, unclear rewards and punishments, unreasonable profit distribution methods, and severe drought attacks, it collapsed in 1949. After the land reform in 1950, the local farmers urgently demanded the restoration and development of production. With the support of the Boye County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Shijiazuo Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was restored, and Gu Fengming, the former director of the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, was elected as the director of the Agricultural Production Cooperative. At that time, a total of nine households participated, with 211.5 mu of land, 42 people, including 21 members of the supply and marketing cooperative, 13 laborers, and 2 draft animals (one mule and one ox).

    After the restoration of the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative, it was the cotton planting season. The first difficulty they encountered was a shortage of grain and cotton seeds. Therefore, through the village supply and marketing cooperative and the county supply and marketing cooperative, they signed five pre-purchase contracts for 12,000 jin of seed cotton. The pre-paid materials obtained by this agricultural production cooperative were: 5,000 jin of corn and red sorghum, and 400 jin of Sizi No. 2 superior cotton seeds. This solved the difficulties of lacking grain and cotton seeds in spring plowing and production, stabilized the mood for production, and ensured the completion of the state's cotton procurement task in the area. In order to support the agricultural production cooperative in carrying out sideline production during the winter slack season, the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative also signed a processing contract for 90,000 jin of seed cotton with the agricultural production cooperative after the autumn. The Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative received 12,600 jin of rice for wages, increasing the income of the cooperative.

    In 1951, in order to expand cotton fields, increase cotton yields, and reward collective production, the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative also prioritized signing a total of seven pre-purchase cotton contracts with the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative, pre-purchasing 8,700 jin of cotton; pre-paying the agricultural production cooperative 9,800 jin of red sorghum and corn, and 200 jin of bean cakes. With the support of the supply and marketing cooperative, the cotton planting area of the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded to more than 100 mu. In winter, a cotton processing contract was also signed, increasing income by 8,016 jin of millet. Therefore, the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative rapidly grew stronger; at the same time, the Shijiazuo Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative also smoothly completed the cotton purchase and cotton processing tasks, ensuring the supply of raw cotton to the state's yarn mills.

    In order to further improve the work in 1952, the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to expand its membership by six households. According to the production plan, a comprehensive supply of goods and sales and ordering contract was signed with the village supply and marketing cooperative, and the types, quantities, and times of the necessities for the year's production and life of the agricultural production cooperative members were all stipulated in the contract. According to the production and living needs of the agricultural production cooperative, the village supply and marketing cooperative plans to supply the agricultural production cooperative with 32,400 jin of red sorghum, 9,000 jin of corn, 54,000 jin of millet, 90,020 jin of bean cakes, 350 jin of fertilizer powder, 250 jin of bone fertilizer, 5 jin of rotenone powder, 20 jin of black soap, 540 jin of kerosene, 480 jin of cottonseed oil, 40 packs of matches, 49 jin of alkali, 600 jin of salt, and 9 bolts of various foreign cloth; and promote the sale of 24,000 jin of seed cotton. In this way, the supply and marketing business has increased significantly, and the agricultural production cooperative has been able to develop and grow rapidly. For example, when the "combined contract" was first signed, the Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative only had one ox and one mule; after the combination, by 1951, it had developed to one horse, one mule, two oxen, and two donkeys, an increase of two-thirds; and some small welfare undertakings were also held, such as the cooperative often preparing some common medicines, stipulating that those who participate in mutual aid labor can use medicine for free if they are sick.

    The Situation of the Jieying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Boye County and the Li Decun Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team Concluding a "Combined Contract"

    The Li Decun Mutual Aid Team in Jieying Village was organized in February 1951 with members of the supply and marketing cooperative as the main component. At that time, a total of ten households participated in the mutual aid team, with 131 mu of land (including 9 mu of irrigated land), 48 people, seven male laborers, six female laborers, two mules, and one horse. At the beginning of spring plowing, the mutual aid team encountered difficulties due to a shortage of grain and bean cakes. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Jieying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a pre-purchase contract for 5,400 jin of seed cotton with the mutual aid team; pre-paying 4,400 jin of bean cakes, 900 jin of corn, 1,389 jin of sorghum, and 1,140 jin of millet, ensuring that the mutual aid team could cultivate on time. Due to the support of the supply and marketing cooperative for the agricultural production mutual aid team, in 1951, this mutual aid team planted 65 mu of cotton, with an increase of 30 jin of seed cotton per mu compared with ordinary people; and 12 mu of millet, with an increase of 70 jin per mu compared with ordinary people. In winter, the village supply and marketing cooperative signed a seed cotton processing contract with the Li Decun Mutual Aid Team, increasing the mutual aid team's income by 4,738 jin of rice, accumulating 1,080 jin of rice in public funds, and purchasing a cart. The lives of the team members have also been greatly improved. For example, the Li Bingzhen family did not have enough to eat in the past, but now they have more than 200 jin of surplus grain.

    In 1952, the Jieying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped the Li Decun Mutual Aid Team formulate the 1952 annual agricultural production plan: The mutual aid team will develop to 13 households this year (5 households without labor also participated in the group), the land will increase to 151.8 mu, 58 people (including 19 members of the supply and marketing cooperative, and 7 military and worker families), 8 male laborers, 4 female laborers, 1 mule, 1 horse, and 2 donkeys. In order to improve the yield per unit area and learn from experience, the production plan also stipulates that 2 mu of high-yield cotton, 2 mu of high-yield millet, and 2 mu of high-yield sweet potatoes should be planted. According to the 1952 production plan of the mutual aid team, the supply and marketing cooperative's plan to supply the mutual aid team is: 2,350 jin of soybean cake, 1,400 jin of corn, 11,000 jin of charcoal, 1,400 jin of sorghum, 1,400 jin of millet, 350 jin of salt, 1,500 jin of black oil, 34 jin of kerosene, 24 packs of matches, 3 bolts of foreign cloth; and promote the sale of 7,000 jin of cotton.

    The Benefits of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Agricultural Production Cooperatives or Mutual Aid Teams Signing "Combined Contracts"

    From the above situation, promoting the combined contracts of supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams is a good form of division of labor between production and sales in rural areas and a new law of material circulation. Its advantages are:

    (1) Through the combined contract, the concrete leadership of the state-owned economy over the small-scale peasant economy can be further strengthened, the blindness of the production of agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams can be gradually overcome, the planned nature of production can be enhanced, and agricultural production can be greatly developed within the scope of the national economic plan; The organized peasants do not have to worry about not being able to sell what they produce, nor do they have to worry about not being able to buy what they need. They can rest assured and actively develop production. In order to make agricultural products meet the standards and specifications stipulated in the contract, farmers will gradually adopt new agricultural tools, continuously improve farming techniques, and improve the quality of crops. With the development of mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as the promotion of "combined contracts," the entire agricultural production will move forward along the road of the New Democratic Revolution, which will ensure that the revolutionary nature of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams does not change and does not lead to the road of capitalism.

    (2) Through the "combined contract," supply and marketing cooperatives can be further promoted to serve agricultural production and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in a more planned way in rural areas. Only by serving agricultural production and agricultural production organizations can the business of supply and marketing cooperatives develop rapidly and in a planned manner. Because, under the constraint of the contract, the purchase objects and sales objects of the supply and marketing cooperatives will be fixed, and according to the supply and marketing requirements of the fixed purchase and sales objects, the supply and marketing cooperatives can formulate business plans that are completely in line with reality. Then, by operating according to this business plan, the planned nature of business operations can be enhanced, the blindness and the capitalist tendency of pursuing the free market can be overcome; the turnover of funds can be accelerated, the accumulation of funds can be avoided, the storage and transportation work can be improved, the damage and consumption can be reduced as much as possible, and the timely supply of farmers with industrial products with good quality and low prices can be achieved. Otherwise, farmers will be unwilling to deal with supply and marketing cooperatives.

    (3) Supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams can develop normally only when they are closely combined through "combined contracts." The Gu Fengming Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Li Decun Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team both developed in the "combined contract" of pre-purchasing cotton with the supply and marketing cooperative. Their experience is: First, through the method of detailed accounting, help agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams formulate agricultural production increase plans. According to the production increase plan, calculate the required means of production and means of livelihood, as well as the agricultural products and by-products that need to be sold. Put these things into a contract and fix them, which is the business operation plan. In this way, it can prevent ordering too much with too little, and reduce speculation. Second, the calculation of the means of production and the promotion of goods can be planned by the main responsible persons of the agricultural production cooperative and the mutual aid team; however, the calculation of daily necessities must be calculated by each basic household, and then integrated into the contract.

    At present, it is the period for carrying out the pre-purchase cotton business. It is hoped that cooperative societies at all levels will attach enough importance to this experience; in addition to summarizing the existing experience, it is hoped that new "combined contracts" will be generally signed in the pre-purchase of cotton.

    两个村供销合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组的“结合合同”
    ——介绍河北省博野县史家佐村供销合作社和谷凤鸣农业生产合作社、解营村供销合作社和李德纯农业生产互助组订立“结合合同”的情况
    李哲人
    两年来，华北各地供销合作社，在与农业生产合作社、农业生产互助组的结合上，曾有不少的创造和典型事实。这种结合是引导广大的、分散的小生产者走向集体化的一种很有效的措施，值得大大推广。现在把河北省博野县第一区史家佐村谷凤鸣农业生产合作社、第三区解营村李德纯农业生产互助组与当地供销合作社订立“结合合同”的情况介绍如下：
    博野史家佐村供销合作社和谷凤鸣农业生产合作社订立“结合合同”的情形
    史家佐村农业生产合作社是一九四七年在当地人民政府领导与帮助下，根据自愿互利原则组织起来的。但由于方针不明确、劳动纪律不严、奖惩不明和分红办法不合理，以及遭受严重的灾荒袭击等原因，曾于一九四九年垮台。一九五零年土地改革后，当地农民迫切要求恢复和发展生产。在博野县供销合作社扶持下，史家佐村农业生产合作社又恢复起来，并推选史家佐村前供销合作社主任谷凤鸣为农业生产合作社主任。当时参加的共有九户，土地二百一十一亩半，四十二口人，其中有二十一人为供销合作社社员，有十三个劳动力，两个牲口（骡一、牛一）。
    谷凤鸣农业生产合作社恢复后，正值种棉季节。他们首先遇到的困难是缺粮食和棉籽。于是通过村供销合作社和县供销合作社前后订定了五次预购籽棉一万二千斤的合同。这个农业生产合作社获得的预付物资有：玉米、红粮五千斤，斯字二比优良棉籽四百斤。这就解决了春耕生产中缺粮食和棉籽的困难，稳定了生产情绪；国家在当地收购棉花任务的完成也有了保证。史家佐村供销合作社为扶持农业生产合作社在冬闲季节开展副业生产，秋后又和农业生产合作社订立了九万斤籽棉的加工合同。谷凤鸣农业生产合作社获得工资米一万二千六百斤，增加了社内收入。
    一九五一年，为扩大棉田，提高棉花产量和奖励集体生产，史家佐村供销合作社又优先和谷凤鸣农业生产合作社前后共订了七份预购棉花合同，预购棉花八千七百斤；预付农业生产合作社红粮、玉米九千八百斤，豆饼二百斤。经过供销合作社的扶持，谷凤鸣农业生产合作社种棉面积就扩大到一百多亩。冬季又订了棉花加工合同，增加收入八千零十六斤小米。因此，谷凤鸣农业生产合作社便迅速壮大起来；同时史家佐村供销合作社也顺利地完成了购棉和棉花加工任务，保证了对国家纱厂的原棉供应。
    为了进一步作好一九五二年的工作，谷凤鸣农业生产合作社计划再扩大社员六户。根据生产计划，和村供销合作社又订了全面的物品供应和推销订购合同，并把农业生产合作社社员全年生产、生活上的必需品的种类、数量、时间等都订到合同上。村供销合作社根据农业生产合作社在生产和生活上的要求，计划供应农业生产合作社红粮三万二千四百斤、玉米九千斤、小米五万四千斤、豆饼九万零二十斤、肥田粉三百五十斤、骨肥二百五十斤、鱼藤粉五斤、黑肥皂二十斤、煤油五百四十斤、棉籽油四百八十斤、火柴四十包、碱面四十九斤、食盐六百斤、各种洋布九匹；推销籽棉二万四千斤。这样，供销业务就有了显著的增加，而农业生产合作社也得以迅速发展和壮大。如最初订立“结合合同”时，谷凤鸣农业生产合作社仅有牛一、骡一；结合以后，到一九五一年就发展到马一、骡一、牛二、驴二，增加了三分之二；并举办了些小的福利事业，如社内经常准备着一些普通药品，规定凡是参加互助劳动者，有病后可免费用药。
    博野县解营村供销合作社和李德纯农业生产互助组订立“结合合同”的情形
    解营村李德纯互助组是在一九五一年二月以供销合作社社员为主要成分组织起来的。当时参加互助组的共十户，有一百三十一亩地（其中水浇地九亩），四十八口人，七个男劳动力，六个女劳动力，两头骡子、一匹马。互助组一开始春耕，就遇到了缺粮和豆饼的困难。为了克服这个困难，解营村供销合作社就向互助组订立了预购五千四百斤籽棉的合同；预付豆饼四千四百斤、玉米九百斤、高粱一千三百八十九斤、小米一千一百四十斤，保证了互助组按时耕种。由于供销合作社对农业生产互助组的扶持，一九五一年这个互助组种棉六十五亩，每亩比一般群众增产籽棉三十斤；谷子十二亩，每亩比一般群众增产七十斤。冬季这个村的供销合作社又和李德纯互助组订立了籽棉加工合同，使互助组增加了四千七百三十八斤米的收入，积累了一千零八十斤米的公积金，并添购了大车一辆。组员的生活也大大改善。如李炳珍家，过去不够吃，现在却有了二百斤余粮。
    一九五二年解营村供销合作社帮助李德纯互助组制订了一九五二年全年的农业生产计划：互助组今年发展到十三户（五户没劳动力的户也参加了本组），土地增加到一百五十一亩八分，人五十八口
    （其中有供销社员十九人，军、工属七户），男劳动力八个，女劳动力四个，骡一头、马一匹、驴二头。为提高单位面积产量和吸取经验，生产计划中并规定种丰产棉二亩，丰产谷二亩，丰产山芋二亩。根据互助组一九五二年的生产计划，供销合作社供应互助组的计划：黄豆饼二千三百五十斤、玉米一千四百斤、炭一万一千斤、高粱一千四百斤、谷子一千四百斤、食盐三百五十斤、黑油一千五百斤、煤油三十四斤、洋火二十四包、洋布三匹；推销棉花七千斤。
    供销合作社和农业生产合作社或互助组订立“结合合同”的好处
    从以上情况看来，推广供销合作社和农业生产合作社或互助组的结合合同，是农村中产销分工的良好形式和物资流转的新规律。它的优点是：
    （1）经过结合合同，可以进一步增强国营经济对小农经济的具体领导，可以逐渐克服农业生产合作社或互助组生产的盲目性，增强生产的计划性，使农业生产能在国家经济计划范围内得到很大的发展；可以使组织起来的农民既不发愁生产出来的东西卖不掉，也不发愁所需要的东西买不来，安心放手地积极地发展生产。为了使农产品合乎合同中所规定的标准规格，农民就会逐渐采用新农具，不断提高耕作技术，改良作物品质。随着互助组、农业生产合作社和供销合作社的发展以及“结合合同”的推广，整个农业生产就会沿着新民主主义革命的大道向前迈进，这就会保证农业生产合作社和互助组的革命性质不起变化，不至于走向资本主义的道路。
    （2）经过“结合合同”，可以进一步推动供销合作社在农村中更加有计划地为农业生产和农业生产合作社、互助组服务。也只有为农业生产和农业生产组织服务，供销合作社的业务才能迅速地有计划地发展起来。因为，在合同的约束下，供销合作社的采购对象和销售对象才会固定起来，而根据固定的采购和销售对象的供销要求，供销合作社才能制定完全切合实际的业务计划。然后，照着这种业务计划去经营，就可以增强业务经营上的计划性，克服盲目性及追逐自由市场的资本主义倾向；可以加速资金周转，避免资金积压，改善储运工作，尽量减少伤耗，做到及时供给农民以物美价廉的工业品。否则，农民就不愿和供销合作社打交道。
    （3）供销合作社和农业生产合作社或互助组经过“结合合同”密切结合起来，双方才能正常地发展。谷凤鸣农业生产合作社和李德纯农业生产互助组，都是在和供销合作社订立预购棉花的“结合合同”中发展起来的。他们的经验是：一、通过算细账的方式，帮助农业生产合作社或互助组，制订农业增产计划。根据增产计划，算出所需要的生产资料和生活资料及须要推销的农产品、副产品。把这些东西订成合同，固定下来，就是业务经营计划。这样，既可防止用少订多，又可减少投机取巧。二、生产资料和推销物品的计算，由农业生产合作社、互助组主要负责人筹划即可；但日用品的计算必须由各基本户算起，而后综合起来订入合同。
    目前正是开展预购棉花业务的时期，希望各级合作社都能足够地重视这个经验；除把已有的经验加以总结外，并希望在预购棉花中普遍订立新的“结合合同”。
