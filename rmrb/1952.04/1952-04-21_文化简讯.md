Cultural Briefs

    ▲ From mid-January to early March, rudimentary elementary schools for workers and peasants have been successively established in Siwei District and Yunhe Township in Hang County, Longyang District in Xindeng County, Qingyun District in Fuyang County, and Kuntong District in Anji County, Zhejiang Province.

    After recognizing that the purpose of establishing rudimentary elementary schools for workers and peasants is to meet the needs of the country and accelerate the training of construction talents, many workers and peasants have tried to overcome various difficulties and actively enrolled in schools.

    The entire process of establishing the schools has been permeated with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods have been applied. For example, in order to solve the living difficulties of some students, the Kuntong District rudimentary elementary school for workers and peasants in Anji County has adopted a work-study method, designating Sundays as production days and organizing students into handcart teams to transport firewood. Without affecting their studies, all schools have carried out after-school production to reduce the burden on students, enrich school equipment, or improve school meals.

    ▲浙江省杭县的四维区和运河乡、新登县的龙羊区、富阳县的青云区、安吉县的昆铜区等地，已自一月中旬至三月初，先后建立了工农速成初等学校。
    不少工农群众在认识到开办工农速成初等学校的目的是为了适应国家的需要，加速培养建设人才之后，就设法克服各种困难，踊跃报名入学。
    各校的整个开办过程，都贯穿着革命的精神和运用了革命的办法。如为了解决部分学生的生活困难，安吉县昆铜区的工农速成初等学校就采用了工读办法，把星期日定为生产日，组织学员手车队去运柴。在不影响学习的前提下，各校都开展了课余生产，以课余生产收入来减轻学生负担，充实学校设备，或改善校中膳食。
