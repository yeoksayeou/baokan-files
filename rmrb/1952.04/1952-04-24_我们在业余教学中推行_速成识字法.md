We are promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method" in amateur teaching
China Textile Workers' Union, Chongqing Municipal Committee
Editor's Note: The achievements of the amateur rapid literacy experimental classes in Chongqing's textile factories powerfully demonstrate that it is possible to promote the rapid literacy method in amateur teaching as well. Trade union organizations and amateur education workers at all levels should value this experience and continue to research and create experiences in amateur teaching in order to universally promote the rapid literacy method among workers, eliminate illiteracy, and improve workers' cultural level.

In order to further research and create experiences in promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method" in amateur teaching, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union opened amateur "Rapid Literacy Method" experimental classes in five textile factories: Chongqing 610, 612, 614, 616, and the China Wool Textile Factory. The experimental classes began successively in mid-October and early November of 1951 and ended on January 25 of this year.

Two or three months of experimentation have proven that the "Rapid Literacy Method" can also be promoted in amateur teaching. After 74 hours of teaching in the 610 Factory's experimental class, the 20 students in Class A improved from an average of 473.2 characters recognized per person to 1901.4 characters recognized per person; the 27 students in Class B improved from an average of 816 characters recognized per person to 1912.9 characters recognized per person. In addition, they spent 17 hours reading workers' textbooks, various picture-story books, and the Workers' Daily; 4 hours looking up dictionaries; and 6 hours writing letters, filling in blanks, and correcting mistakes. Therefore, the students also made significant improvements in their reading and writing abilities. At the end of the course, the students all wrote letters to Chairman Mao, reporting on their happy lives of learning culture after liberation. After 68 hours of study in the 612 Factory's experimental class, the 20 students improved from an average of 877 characters recognized per person to 1836 characters recognized per person. In addition, they spent 4 hours reading volumes 3 to 6 of the workers' textbook and newspapers; 3 hours looking up dictionaries; and 1 hour writing characters. After 78 hours of study in the 614 Factory's experimental class, most of the 195 students recognized 1098 more characters than before, and generally recognized more than 900 more characters than before. After 82 hours of study in the 616 Factory's experimental class, the 13 students improved from an average of 365 characters recognized per person to 1777 characters recognized per person; in addition, they spent 6 hours reading workers' textbooks and newspapers; and 6 hours engaging in writing, filling in blanks, and correcting mistakes, which improved their reading and writing abilities.

In amateur teaching, the entire teaching process is the same as the teaching process for personnel who are detached from production. The only difference is that the learning time for personnel who are detached from production is concentrated, while the learning time for amateurs is dispersed.

In this experiment, we have the following insights:

First, strengthen ideological leadership. The learning time in amateur teaching is dispersed, and students are often distracted by production and family chores, which hinders their learning. The 614 Factory is far from the market, and some people are absent from class every week to go to the market. At the same time, because the factory has heavy production tasks and family burdens, etc., the students' thoughts are easily distracted. For example, Chen Hailin, the production team leader, was always worried about whether there would be accidents in production; some even wanted to engage in sideline production. This made them uneasy when studying, which affected their learning progress. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with the trade union or relevant parties to thoroughly understand the situation and help them solve ideological problems in a timely manner, so as to ensure the smooth progress of teaching.

Second, normal production and guaranteed study time are important conditions for completing the teaching plan. The 610, 616, and 612 factories have relatively normal production, with no overtime, and the students have no mobility and few absences. The students' learning mood is stable, and their academic performance is good. The 614 Factory works nine hours a day, with frequent overtime, resulting in many absences, which affects the students' learning mood. As a result, 14 students in the second class dropped out of study due to excessive suspensions, with an average of more than eight hours of absence per person, so their academic performance was worse than that of other factories.

Third, amateur teaching has more time gaps, and students can use the time to review. Therefore, amateur teaching must make good use of extracurricular review. Secondly, big-character posters, blackboards, group discussion outlines, newspapers, etc. in factories can all help consolidate learning achievements.

### 我们在业余教学中推行“速成识字法”

    我们在业余教学中推行“速成识字法”
    中国纺织工会重庆市委员会
    编者按：重庆市各纺织厂业余速成识字法实验班的成绩，有力地证明了在业余教学中推行速成识字法同样是可能的。各级工会组织和职工业余教育工作者应该重视这一经验，继续研究和创造在业余教学的经验，以便在工人中普遍推广速成识字法，消灭文盲，提高工人的文化水平。
    为了进一步研究和创造在业余教学中推行“速成识字法”的经验，中国纺织工会重庆市委员会在重庆六一○、六一二、六一四、六一六、中国毛纺织厂等五个纺织厂中，分别开办了业余“速成识字法”实验班。各实验班在一九五一年十月中旬和十一月初陆续开学，于今年一月二十五日结束。
    两三个月的实验，证明“速成识字法”在业余教学中同样是可以推行的。六一○厂实验班经过七十四小时的教学，甲班二十名学员，从原来平均每人认识四百七十三点二个字，提高到认识一千九百零一点四个字；乙班二十七名学员，从原来每人认识八百一十六个字，提高到认识一千九百零十二点九个字。另外，又以十七个小时阅读工人课本和各种连环画、工人日报；四小时查字典；六小时写信、填空、改错，所以学员们在阅读和写作能力方面也有显著提高。学员在结业时，都写信给毛主席，报告在解放后学习文化的幸福生活。六一二厂实验班经过六十八小时的学习，二十名学员从原来平均每人认识八百七十七个字，提高到认识一千八百三十六个字。另外以四小时的时间，阅读了工人课本三至六册和报纸；三小时的时间查字典；一小时的时间写字。参加六一四厂实验班学习的一百九十五名学员，经过了七十八小时的学习后，大部分学员比原来多认识了一千零九十八个字，一般也比原来多认识了九百多字。六一六厂实验班的十三名学员，经过八十二小时学习后，学员从原来平均每人认识三百六十五个字提高到认识一千七百七十七个字；另外用六小时阅读了工人课本、报纸；六小时从事写作、填空、改错。提高了阅读、写作能力。
    在业余教学中，整个教学过程和脱离生产人员的教学过程相同。其区别只是脱离生产的人员的学习时间集中，业余的学习时间分散。
    这次实验中我们有以下几个体会：
    第一、加强思想领导。业余教学的学习时间分散，学员经常为生产和家庭琐事所牵累，精神不集中，妨碍了学习。六一四厂离市场远，每星期有一部分人因赶市场而缺课。同时，因厂里的生产任务重和家庭的负担等等，所以学员的思想容易分散。如生产组长陈海林老在担心着生产上是否会发生事故；有的还想搞副业生产。这就使他们在学习时不安心，影响了学习进度。因此，必须通过工会或有关方面的配合，深入了解情况，及时帮助他们解决思想问题，这样才能保证教学的顺利进行。
    第二、生产情况正常，保证学习时间，是完成教学计划的一个重要条件。六一○厂、六一六厂、六一二厂，生产情况比较正常，没有加班加点现象，学员没有流动性，缺课少，学员们学习的情绪就安定，学习成绩就好；六一四厂，每天工作九小时，加班加点的情况较多，因之缺课者多，影响了学员的学习情绪，结果第二班因停课过多而中止学习的有十四人，全班平均每人缺课八小时以上，因此学习成绩也比其他厂差些。
    第三、业余教学，空隙的时间较多，学员可以利用时间进行复习，因此业余教学必须很好地掌握课外复习。其次，工厂中的大字报、黑板报、小组讨论提纲、报纸等，都是可以帮助巩固学习成绩的。
