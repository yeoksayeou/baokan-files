More than a week has passed since the Fourth Agenda Item staff meeting was adjourned. Our liaison officer notified the other side, suggesting a swift reconvening of the staff meeting.

    美方续拖延第三项议程谈判
    我建议迅速重开第四项议程参谋会
    【新华社开城十三日电】十三日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，对方继续采取了显然拖延停战谈判的态度。会议历时不足一分钟，毫无进展。
    第四项议程参谋会议休会以来，已超过一星期。我方联络官通知对方，建议迅速重新召开参谋会议。
