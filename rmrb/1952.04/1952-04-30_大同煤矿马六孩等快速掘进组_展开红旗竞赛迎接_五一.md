    Datong Coal Mine Ma Liu Hai and Other Rapid Tunneling Teams
    Launch Red Flag Competition to Greet "May Day"
    To the Editor: Encouraged by the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, the Ma Liu Hai and other rapid tunneling teams of Datong Coal Mine have launched a Red Flag competition movement, creating new records one after another to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day.
    The nationally renowned Ma Liu Hai tunneling team, in order to ensure the smooth completion of production tasks, signed a collective contract with the mine's administrative side at the end of March, and mutually proposed guarantee conditions with the electrical and mechanical maintenance, track laying and other relevant units. The three rapid tunneling teams of the mine's labor models Zhao You, Liu Yutong, and Liu Shouran further studied the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai team, and also implemented the "Tunneling Cycle Chart System" and "Deep Hole Operation" (i.e., deep hole drilling) work methods respectively, so that labor was rationally allocated. All types of work also accurately grasped and utilized production time. As a result, each team created amazing new records. According to accurate statistics from April 1st to 18th, the Ma Liu Hai tunneling team, in a roadway three meters wide and two meters high, tunneled a total of 313.01 meters in eighteen working days, with a total attendance of 162 work shifts. The average progress per shift was 1.932 meters, exceeding the original quota of one meter by 93.2 percent. The Liu Shouran tunneling team, in a roadway three meters wide and 1.5 meters high, tunneled 351.25 meters in eighteen working days, with a total attendance of 158 work shifts. The average progress per shift was 2.2231 meters, exceeding the original quota by 71 percent. The Liu Yutong tunneling team, in a roadway three meters wide and two meters high, tunneled a total of 282.06 meters in eighteen working days. The average progress per shift was 1.75 meters, exceeding the original quota by 75.1 percent. The Zhao You tunneling team, in a roadway three meters wide and 1.5 meters high, tunneled a total of 302.81 meters in eleven working days from April 4th to 14th, with an attendance of 154 work shifts. The average progress per shift was 1.97 meters, exceeding the original quota by 51 percent. Now, the workers of each team are full of confidence to overfulfill the monthly production plan of 500 meters.

    大同煤矿马六孩等快速掘进组
    展开红旗竞赛迎接“五一”
    编辑同志：大同煤矿马六孩等快速掘进组，在“三反”斗争的胜利鼓舞下，展开红旗竞赛运动，纷纷创造新纪录，迎接“五一”劳动节。
    全国闻名的马六孩掘进组，为了保证生产任务顺利完成，三月底和该矿行政方面签订了集体合同，并和机电检修、钉道等有关单位，互相提出了保证条件。该矿劳动模范赵有、刘玉桐、刘守仁三个快速掘进组，进一步学习了马六孩小组的先进经验，还分别实行了“掘进循环图表制”和“深孔作业”（即深打眼）的工作法，使劳动力得到了合理的配备。各工种也精确地掌握和运用了生产时间。因此，各组都创造了惊人的新纪录。根据四月一日到十八日精确的统计，马六孩掘进组在三公尺宽、二公尺高的巷道里，十八个工作日共掘进三百一十三公尺零一公分，共出勤一百六十二个工。每工平均进度一公尺九十三公分二，超过每人一公尺的原定额百分之九十三点二。刘守仁掘进组在三公尺宽、一公尺五十公分高的巷道里，十八个工作日掘进三百五十一公尺二十五公分，共出勤一百五十八个工。每工平均进度为二公尺二十二公分三一，超过原定额百分之七十一。刘玉桐掘进组，在三公尺宽、二公尺高的巷道里，十八个工作日共掘进二百八十二公尺零六公分。每工平均进度一公尺七十五公分，超过原定额百分之七十五点一。赵有掘进组在三公尺宽、一公尺五十公分高的巷道里，自四月四日到十四日十一个工作日里，共掘进三百零二公尺八十一公分，出勤一百五十四个工。每工平均进度为一公尺九十七公分，超过原定额百分之五十一。现在，各组的工人都充满信心地要超额完成月进五百公尺的生产计划。    马良
