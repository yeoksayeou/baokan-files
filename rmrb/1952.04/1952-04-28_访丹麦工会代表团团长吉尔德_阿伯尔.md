    Visiting Mr. Gilder Abel, Head of the Danish Trade Union Delegation

    Mr. Gilder Abel, head of the Danish Trade Union Delegation, who was invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, is a well-known Danish playwright. His enthusiasm in receiving our reporter showed his love for New China. He said that when he learned that a new China had appeared in the East, he, like all progressive Danes, wanted to come to China to see it. But he did not get a suitable opportunity. Therefore, after receiving the invitation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend our country's "May Day" celebrations, he immediately came to China.

    Since arriving in Beijing, Mr. Gilder Abel has visited some middle schools and universities in Beijing. He said that the China he had seen in newspapers and books before was an old, lifeless China; now he has seen with his own eyes a new, lively, and vibrant China. After a few days of visiting, he said: "I have not only seen the new China, but also the new world of the future." Tsinghua University and the Women's Middle School attached to the Normal University in Beijing left him with unforgettable impressions. He said that the feeling of happiness is rising in the schools. Everyone is aware of the future. He said that he was deeply moved by the students' high sense of responsibility for the school and for New China. At the Women's Middle School attached to the Normal University, he saw a happy expression on the face of every student. Recalling the situation at Tsinghua University, he said: "No one can take away their happiness and joy of life."

    Mr. Gilder Abel said: The Danish people have unlimited sympathy for the liberation of the Chinese people. The Danish people call Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, a great leader, a great statesman, and a great poet. In Denmark, we imagine New China as if it were a myth; but after coming to China, we found it to be a real myth.

    Talking about the Danish people's contribution to defending world peace, Mr. Gilder Abel said: The Danish people have always been and still are peace-loving people. The Danish people understand that it is impossible to find anything more important than avoiding war at present. He said: The Danish people's will to love peace supports the world people's will to love peace.

    Mr. Gilder Abel recalled the Danish people's contribution to the movement for world peace. He said that in Denmark, more than 150,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. 150,000 people is not a large number for Denmark, which has a population of more than 4.2 million; however, our peace activists are still continuing to overcome difficulties and strive for more signatures. In addition, besides the Danish branch of the World Peace Movement, there are also some important peace organizations in Denmark, such as the organization of the International League for Peace and Freedom. More than 20,000 peasant women alone participate in this organization. When General Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the Chinese people, accused the US imperialism of its crimes of aggression at the UN General Assembly, the members of the Danish International League for Peace and Freedom sent 10,000 postcards to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie to support New China's participation in the UN Security Council. In Denmark, there are also organizations such as the Peace League and War Resisters that defend world peace. The International Democratic Women's Federation is also very active in the movement to defend world peace in Denmark. Mr. Gilder Abel said: During the period when Denmark was occupied by German fascists, the Danish people knew that the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese imperialism was our great ally in resisting Germany.

    访丹麦工会代表团团长吉尔德·阿伯尔
    应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的丹麦工会代表团团长吉尔德·阿伯尔是丹麦著名的剧作家。他接待我国记者的热情，说明了他对新中国的热爱。他说，当他知道一个新的中国出现在东方的时候，他和一切进步的丹麦人一样，就希望到中国来看看。但他没有得到适当的机会。所以这次接到中华全国总工会参加我国“五一”节观礼的邀请后，立即到中国来了。
    吉尔德·阿伯尔来到北京以后，已经参观了北京的一些中学和大学。他说，他从前在报纸、书刊上看到的中国，是旧的、老的、没有生气的中国；现在亲眼看到的是新的、生动的、充满了活力的中国。经过几天的参观，他说：“我不但看见了新的中国，而且看见了未来的新世界。”北京的清华大学、师范大学附属女子中学，给他留下了难忘的印象。他说，学校里快乐的感情在升涨着。每一个人都意识到将来的前途。他说，他深为学生们对于学校、对于新中国的高度责任感所感动。在师范大学附属女子中学，他看见每一个学生的脸上都是快乐的表情。回想起清华大学的情形，他说：“没有人可以抢去他们生活的幸福和快乐。”
    吉尔德·阿伯尔说：丹麦人民对于中国人民的解放，寄予无限的同情。丹麦人们称中国人民的领袖毛泽东是伟大的领袖、伟大的政治家和伟大的诗人。在丹麦，我们想像新中国时，好像是神话一样；但到中国后，发现它是一个现实的神话。
    谈到丹麦人民在保卫世界和平中的贡献，吉尔德·阿伯尔团长说：丹麦人民一向是、现在依然是爱好和平的人民。丹麦人民懂得：目前不可能找到任何比避免战争更重要的事情。他说：丹麦人民爱好和平的意志支持着世界人民爱好和平的意志。
    吉尔德·阿伯尔回忆丹麦人民在争取世界和平运动中的贡献。他说，在丹麦，已有十五万人以上签名要求五大国缔结和平公约。十五万人，对于四百二十多万人口的丹麦来说，是不多的数目；可是，我们的和平运动者，还正在继续克服困难，争取更多的签名。此外，丹麦除了世界和平运动丹麦分会之外，还有一些重要的和平组织，例如和平与自由国际同盟的组织。单是参加这个组织的农民妇女就有两万多人。当中国人民的代表伍修权将军在联合国大会上控诉美帝国主义的侵略罪行时，丹麦和平与自由国际同盟会员，曾发出一万张明信片，给联合国秘书长赖伊支持新中国参加联合国安全理事会。在丹麦，还有和平联盟、战争抵抗者等等保卫世界和平的组织。国际民主妇联，在丹麦保卫世界和平运动中也非常活跃。吉尔德·阿伯尔说：在丹麦被德国法西斯占领的期间，丹麦人民知道中国人民反对日本帝国主义的斗争是我们抵抗德国的伟大同盟者。（林里）（附图片）
