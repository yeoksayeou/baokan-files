    Why Song Chengquan's Cotton Bumper Harvest Plan Failed Last Year
    Jin Xibin

    Song Chengquan is a working farmer from Beizhai Village, Handan County, Hebei Province. In the past, under the reactionary rule and the exploitation of feudal landlords, he suffered greatly. After liberation and the land reform, he was emancipated, and thus had a high enthusiasm for production. In 1951, encouraged by patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea, he saved the money originally planned for building a house in 1950 and instead bought 10,000 jin of cottonseed cakes and soybean cakes, investing heavily in production to strive for a bumper harvest. He had more than 30 mu of land, planted 28 mu with cotton, and designated one and a half mu of it as bumper harvest land, aiming to harvest 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    The one and a half mu of cotton field that Song Chengquan planned to cultivate for a bumper harvest was irrigated land and also land repeatedly planted with cotton. He plowed this one and a half mu of cotton field once in the winter of 1950 and again deeply plowed it with a double-ox team in the spring of 1951, harrowing it a total of six times. In mid-February last year, he applied 1,500 jin of straw circle manure per mu; on April 5th, he also applied 300 jin each of fermented cottonseed cakes and unfermented broken soybean cakes, turning them into the soil as base fertilizer. During the cotton growth period, on July 8th, he also applied 30 jin of superphosphate lime along the ridges (more than three cun away from the seedlings), and on the 18th, he applied 250 jin of rapeseed cakes as topdressing in the furrows. He not only vigorously increased fertilizer application and deep plowing and harrowing, but also paid attention to cultivating, weeding, and pest control, strengthening the cultivation management of cotton. But what was the result of the bumper harvest cultivation? According to our on-the-spot investigation, the actual yield was 435 jin of seed cotton per mu (280 jin before frost and 155 jin after frost).

    Why did this heavily invested and carefully managed bumper harvest plan of 1,000 jin fail to be achieved? What are the lessons of the failure? According to our understanding and joint research with him, in addition to the hail storm suffered on July 20th, there were many unreasonable aspects in cultivation techniques, forming many shortcomings, which were the main reasons for the failure to achieve the bumper harvest plan. For example:

    (1) Late sowing: Due to the improper coordination between the application of unfermented cake fertilizer and the timing of irrigation and sowing, the seeds sown on April 20th were all burned dry and withered, and they failed to germinate even after a period of seventeen days; therefore, he sowed for the second time on May 13th, and the cotton seedlings did not emerge completely until the end of May, which was actually equivalent to sowing eight days after the Start of Summer, becoming what the farmers call "three-plow cotton." According to the bumper harvest investigation summaries in Cheng'an and Feixiang areas, the yield of three-plow cotton is half that of first-plow cotton (generally, first-plow cotton yields 170-180 jin per mu, while three-plow cotton yields only 80-90 jin per mu). This shows that failing to sow in a timely manner is one of the important reasons why he was unable to complete the bumper harvest plan.

    (2) Excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers without proper coordination of management techniques such as pruning and branch removal. For example, on the basis of applying 1,500 jin of straw circle manure, he also applied 850 jin per mu of fine cake fertilizers mainly containing nitrogen; however, because he did not properly coordinate management techniques such as pruning and branch removal, the cotton plants grew many branches and leaves but did not set many bolls, which not only failed to meet the requirements for a bumper harvest but also prolonged the maturity period and increased the number of post-frost flowers.

    (3) Few cotton plants, insufficient density. His cotton field had about 1,680 plants per mu, and suffered damage during the growth period, with many missing seedlings. According to his own records: mole crickets killed 25 plants, aphids control broke 13, ant eggs harvesting cost 5. According to the summary of general bumper harvest investigations, appropriate close planting is the main technical measure to increase yield. His bumper harvest cotton field had only more than 1,600 plants per mu, which was too few, and also hindered his bumper harvest.

    (4) Late topping. In order to inhibit the continued development of cotton plants in the later stage, it is generally necessary to top them early after the Start of the Sanfu period (mid-July) so that all nutrients are supplied to the growth of cotton bolls, promoting early maturity. However, he did not top this one and a half mu of cotton until the Beginning of Autumn, which also hindered bumper harvests and early maturity.

    (5) Heavy insect damage. Aphids were discovered on June 1st, and cotton oil mud, rotenone powder, and other pesticides were used for control ten times from June 6th to July 18th. He fought pests for a month and a half, and although the insect damage was reduced a lot, because the aphids appeared many times, reproduced quickly, and lasted for a long time, they inhibited the growth of cotton bolls, delayed the maturity period, and reduced the harvest.

    Although Song Chengquan did not achieve his planned bumper harvest last year due to the above reasons, he has summarized this experience and lessons, and found the reasons; he not only did not lose heart, but strengthened his confidence in completing the plan of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu this year. He said: "The leading comrades of governments at all levels are so concerned about me. In this year's production, I must remember the lessons of last year's yield reduction that I have summarized, study hard, correct shortcomings, improve technology, and strive to achieve this year's plan of 1,000 jin per mu."

    宋成全去年棉花丰产计划为什么没有实现
    金熙彬
    宋成全是河北省邯郸县北寨村的一个劳动农民。过去在反动统治及封建地主的剥削下，受尽了痛苦。解放后经过土地改革，他翻了身，因此生产劲头很高。一九五一年，在抗美援朝爱国主义教育的鼓舞下，他把一九五○年原来计划修盖屋子的钱节余下来，改买了一万斤棉籽饼和黄豆饼，大力向生产投资，争取丰产。他共有三十多亩地，种了二十八亩棉花；并把其中的一亩半地订为丰产地，争取每亩要收到籽棉一千斤。
    宋成全计划进行丰产栽培的一亩半棉田是水浇地，也是重茬棉地。他把这一亩半棉田在一九五○年冬犁了一遍，一九五一年春又用双牛套深耕了一遍，前后共耙了六遍。在去年二月中，每亩上了一千
    五百斤草圈粪；四月五日又上发过酵的棉籽饼和没发过酵的碎黄豆饼各三百斤，并翻到地里作基肥。在棉花生育期间，七月八日又顺垄（距苗株三寸多远）施了三十斤过磷酸石灰，十八日又沟施了二百五十斤菜籽饼作追肥。他不仅大力增施肥料和深耕多耙，同时也注意了中耕除虫，加强对棉花的栽培管理。但是丰产栽培的结果怎样呢？据我们实地的调查，每亩实收籽棉四百三十五斤（霜前二百八十斤，霜后一百五十五斤）。
    为什么这样大力投资和注意耕作管理而丰产千斤的计划没有完成呢？失败的教训是在那里呢？据我们了解及和他共同研究的结果，除因七月二十日曾遭受一次冰雹的袭击外，在耕作技术上有许多不够合理，形成很多缺点，是没有实现丰产计划的主要原因。例如：
    （一）播种晚：他因施用没发酵的饼肥和灌水播种的时间配合不当，使四月二十日播下的种籽全被烧干枯，经过了十七天的期间也没能出芽；所以在五月十三日又第二次播种，到五月底棉苗才出齐，实际就等于是立夏后八天才播的种，成了农民群众所谓的“三耧花”。根据成安、肥乡一带的丰产调查总结，三耧花比头耧花（谷雨节播种的）产量要差一倍（一般头耧花每亩产一百七、八十斤，三耧花每亩才产八、九十斤）。这就说明了没有适时播种是他没有能够完成丰产计划的重要原因之一。
    （二）过多地施用了氮素肥料，没有适当配合整枝打杈等管理技术。如他在已施一千五百斤草圈粪的基础上，每亩又连施了含氮素为主的饼类细肥达八百五十斤；但因为没有适当配合整枝打杈等管理技术，所以棉棵长的枝叶多而坐桃不多，不仅不能达到丰产的要求，而且延长了成熟期，增多了霜后花。
    （三）棉棵少，密度不够。他的棉田每亩约有一千六百八十棵，生育期间并遭受了灾害的损失，缺苗颇多。据他本人的记载：蝼蛄咬死二十五棵，治蚜时折伤了十三棵，掘蚁卵损失五棵。根据一般丰产调查的总结，适当密植是提高产量的主要技术措施，他的丰产棉田每亩只有一千六百多棵，株数太少，也是妨碍他丰产的一个原因。
    （四）打尖晚。为了抑制后期棉棵继续发育，一般应在入伏后（七月中）早打尖，使所有养分供应棉铃成长，促进早熟。但他这一亩半棉花到立秋节才进行打尖，因此也妨碍了丰产和早熟。
    （五）虫害太重。六月一日发现了蚜虫，六月六日开始至七月十八日共用棉油泥、鱼藤粉等除治了十次。前后和害虫进行了一个半月之久的斗争，虫害虽减轻了很多，但由于蚜虫生的次数多，繁殖快，延续的时间长，抑制了棉花铃的成长，延迟了成熟期，减低了收成。
    宋成全去年虽然由于以上原因，没有按计划达成丰产计划，但他已总结了这段经验教训，找出了原因；他不但毫不泄劲，反而加强了今年完成每亩产籽棉千斤的计划的信心。他说：“各级政府领导同志对我这样关心，我在今年生产中，一定要记住总结出来的去年减产的教训，努力学习，改正缺点，提高技术，为争取今年每亩千斤的计划的实现而努力。”
