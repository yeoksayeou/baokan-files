Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd—In order to realize its absurd proposition of so-called “voluntary repatriation” on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, the American aggressors have used a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps to engage in all kinds of criminal activities that violate international conventions, conspiring to hand over our captured personnel to the Kuomintang remnants for persecution and slaughter, or to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the United States in expanding its war of aggression.

The American aggressors' sinister measures in using Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents were revealed as early as March 7, 1951, by the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the American monopoly groups. At that time, the newspaper’s Taipei dispatch said: Twenty-two Chiang Kai-shek "interpreters" had secretly left Taiwan for Korea on February 4 and March 6, 1951, to work for the U.S. military in Korea. At the same time, on February 14, another six Chiang Kai-shek air force officers, disguised in plain clothes, left Taiwan for Korea, specifically to prepare for the interrogation of captured air force personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The dispatch also revealed that there were still 300 "interpreters" in Taiwan who had been trained by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek before the Japanese surrender, and they would be successively dispatched to the headquarters of the U.S. military in Korea to await orders.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents, who were installed by the U.S. military in Korea as so-called "instructors" in the prisoner-of-war camps, were even more ubiquitous. For example, the January 28th issue of the American "Time" magazine said: "The intelligence group in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp has five Chinese Kuomintang members from Taiwan, and another twenty-two people (Chinese) are in charge of educational classes." The Associated Press also revealed on March 2nd that there were nineteen Chinese from Taiwan serving as "teachers" in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. In addition to this, U.S. news reports have also openly claimed that 104 "instructors" have been sent from Taiwan to "train" our captured personnel. On January 9, at the subcommittee of the fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks, our representative, General Li Sang-cho, pointed out this matter to the U.S. side, and the U.S. representative, Libby, was unable to deny it.

Under the instigation of the American aggressors, these Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents have not hesitated to use all kinds of cruel and shameless means to create conditions for forcibly detaining our captured personnel. They brutally tattooed our captured personnel, forced our captured personnel to sign petitions drafted by Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents demanding "voluntary repatriation" in blood, and forced our captured personnel to participate in so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" and "Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," etc. The American aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents attempted to use these barbaric methods to force our captured personnel to no longer dare to express their desire to return to their motherland, so as to achieve their despicable purpose of "forced detention" in the name of "voluntary repatriation."

The evil plan of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek gang to use these heinous atrocities to transfer our captured personnel to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for persecution and slaughter, or to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. in expanding its war of aggression, is accelerating. The personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet embassy in South Korea shamelessly stated on January 15: "Once things are ready, the vast majority of Communist Chinese prisoners of war are willing to return to the territory of Kuomintang China." An April 16th Associated Press dispatch from Taipei said nakedly: "Kuomintang China not only opposes forced exchange of prisoners, but is also prepared to accept all Communist Chinese prisoners of war who have been screened by the Allied forces and are willing to participate in the struggle against communism to come to Taiwan." The "blood letters" entirely handled by Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents in the name of our captured volunteers further exposed the conspiracy of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to force our captured volunteers to serve as cannon fodder. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on March 3, "According to semi-official Kuomintang sources: In the Pusan prisoner-of-war camp, forty-five Communist Chinese prisoners of war wrote a blood letter asking to come to Taipei to participate in the National Government's anti-communist struggle." At the same time, "The National Government has expressed welcome to Communist Chinese prisoners of war in Korea who volunteer to participate in the resistance against communism."

From the evil activities carried out by the American aggressors in directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, it is not difficult for people to see the real purpose of the U.S. side's insistence on the unreasonable demand for so-called "voluntary repatriation" in the armistice negotiations. The Chinese people oppose with intolerable anger the U.S. side's conspiracy to send our captured personnel to the Kuomintang remnants under the pretext of so-called "voluntary repatriation," and are determined to fight to the end to safeguard the safety and survival rights of our captured personnel.

    美国阴谋将我被俘人员供蒋匪迫害和屠杀
    我国人民决不能容忍这一令人发指的暴行
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美国侵略者为了实现其在交换俘虏问题上的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，使用了大批蒋匪特务分子在美方俘虏营中从事种种违反国际公约的罪恶活动，阴谋将我方被俘人员交给国民党残匪，供其进行迫害和屠杀，或驱使他们在美国扩大侵略战争时充当炮灰。
    美国侵略者使用蒋匪特务分子的罪恶措施，美国垄断集团的喉舌“纽约时报”早在一九五一年三月七日即已有所透露。当时该报台北专电说：蒋匪“翻译人员”二十二名已先后在一九五一年二月四日和三月六日秘密离台湾赴朝鲜，为侵朝美军工作。同时，在二月十四日，另有蒋匪空军军官六人，改穿便服离台赴朝，专为准备审讯中国人民志愿军的被俘空军人员之用。该电并透露，在日本投降前由美蒋训练的“翻译人员”，当时还有三百人在台湾，他们将陆续被征派到侵朝美军总部去听候使用。
    被侵朝美军安插在战俘营中充当所谓“教官”的蒋匪特务，更是遍地皆是。例如，今年一月二十八日的美国“时代”周刊说：“巨济岛的俘虏营谍报组中有五个从台湾来的中国国民党人，另外有二十二个人（中国人）掌管教育班。”美联社在三月二日也透露，巨济岛战俘营中有十九名来自台湾的中国人充任“教员”。除此以外，美方的新闻报道也曾公开宣称：已从台湾派了一百零四名“教官”，“训练”我方被俘人员。在一月九日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表李相朝将军曾就此事向美方提出指责，美方代表李比也无法抵赖。
    在美国侵略者的指使下，这些蒋匪特务分子不惜利用各种残酷而无耻的手段，为强迫扣留我方被俘人员创造条件。他们残暴地在我方被俘人员的身上刺字，强迫我方被俘人员用血在蒋匪特务草拟的要求“自愿遣返”的请愿书上签字，并强迫我方被俘人员参加所谓“反共救国团”和“青年反共救国团”等。美国侵略者和蒋匪特务企图以这种野蛮的手段，迫使我方被俘人员不敢再表示要求归返祖国的愿望，以达到其名为“自愿遣返”实为“强迫扣留”的卑鄙目的。
    美蒋匪帮妄图利用这些令人发指的暴行，把我方被俘人员移交给蒋介石匪帮，供其进行迫害和屠杀或驱使他们充当美国扩大侵略战争的炮灰的罪恶计划，正在加速进行中。蒋匪驻南朝鲜的伪使馆人员曾在一月十五日恬不知耻地表示：“一俟事情准备停当，绝大部分共产党中国战俘都愿意回到国民党中国境内”。美联社台北四月十六日电赤裸裸地说：“国民党中国不仅反对强迫交换俘虏，并准备接受为联军甄别过，愿意参加反对共产主义斗争的所有中共俘虏到来台湾。”蒋匪特务假借我志愿军被俘人员的名义所一手包办的“血书”，更加暴露了美蒋匪帮企图强迫我志愿军被俘人员充当炮灰的阴谋。据美联社台北三月三日讯，“据国民党半官方消息：釜山战俘营内，中共战俘四十五人，血书诉请来台北，参加国府之反共斗争。”同时，“国府方面已表示欢迎在韩中共战俘志愿参加抗共。”
    从美国侵略者指使蒋匪特务分子在美方战俘营所进行的这些罪恶活动来看，人们就不难看出美方在停战谈判中始终坚持所谓“自愿遣返”的无理要求的真正目的。中国人民以无法容忍的愤怒反对美方藉口所谓“自愿遣返”将我方被俘人员送交国民党残匪的阴谋，并坚决为维护我方被俘人员的安全和生存权利而斗争到底。
