New People, New Deeds

　　Warehouse Protection Model Shen Huachi
　　Editor: Shen Huachi, a young militiaman from Qingshui Village, Longhui County, Hunan Province, is a warehouse protection model.
　　Before liberation, Shen Huachi herded cattle for landlords. After liberation, he became a member of the Qingshui Village Warehouse Protection Committee. Shen Huachi has made great achievements in warehouse protection work. His first method of protecting the warehouse is to mobilize and rely on the masses. He first cultivated five activists. Under his and the activists' leadership and persuasion, the villagers understood the principle of "If public grain is well protected, the liberation will be secure," and established a relatively sound self-defense organization including forty militiamen. Shen Huachi's second method of protecting the warehouse is to work tirelessly and overcome difficulties. The militiamen patrol and guard at night, and Shen Huachi inspects the posts. Regardless of wind, frost, rain, or night, he never stops. On New Year's Eve last year, it snowed heavily, and the cold wind was biting, but Shen Huachi still guarded the warehouse for the entire night. Shen Huachi's third method of protecting the warehouse is to always care about the safety of the grain. "Check for leaks in the warehouse when it rains heavily" is the first article of Shen Huachi's patriotic pledge. Once, the warehouse was surrounded by water, and Shen Huachi and two workers quickly drained the water. Shen Huachi also often proposes suggestions for improving the work. Under Shen Huachi's leadership, not a single grain of grain in Qingshui Village's warehouse was lost.
　　In November 1951, at the district-wide commendation meeting for warehouse protection militiamen, Shen Huachi was awarded the title of "Special Class Warehouse Protection Model." The militiamen unanimously stated: "We must learn from Shen Huachi!"

　　Changes in the People's Lives in Shaheji
　　Editor: There are two Shahe Rivers near Shaheji Station on the Jinpu Railway. The yellow sand in the river reflects the sun, looking like gold. Before liberation, landlords and bureaucrats often came nearby to admire this beautiful scenery. However, the working people near Shahe River lived a miserable life. After liberation, Chairman Mao called on the people to work hard to produce, and the Shahe District People's Government, with the yellow sand of Shahe River as the object, organized the people of Shaheji to carry out sideline production. The sand of Shahe River can be used for building houses and paving roads in large cities such as Nanjing, and it can also be used for repairing the Huai River. The local cooperative signed a sand transportation contract with relevant units in Nanjing. The people of Shaheji began to transport river sand from late November last year. At first, there were only thirty-four carts for transporting sand, but in less than half a month, it developed to one hundred and ten carts. Initially, the daily income of a laborer carrying sand could support seven or eight people, but due to the high enthusiasm for work, the income from carrying sand could later support fifteen people. By the end of the old lunar year last year, the people of Shaheji earned 204 million yuan from transporting sand. The lives of the people there have greatly improved. The people of Shaheji are very active in this sideline production. They ask the cooperative and the Huai River management project leading organs to also sign sand transportation contracts in order to expand and continue this sideline production.
　　The sand-carrying carts of the people of Shaheji, one after another, are like flowing water. Now it is truly "Shahe River has turned into gold."

　　New Scenes Appear in the People's Langya Mountain
　　Editor: Three miles southwest of Chuxian Station on the Jinpu Railway is Langya Mountain, with its beautiful scenery, famous throughout the country. Here, there are the "Langya Temple," "Zuiweng Pavilion," etc., built by the working people. Before liberation, every spring and autumn, many large landlords and big bureaucrats, after exploiting the fat of the working people, came here to live a licentious and shameless life. After liberation, Langya Mountain became the people's own mountain. It is not only appreciated and enjoyed by the working people, but also has become one of the places where the working people develop production. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the local working people built an agricultural and forestry farm at the foot of Langya Mountain. In the past three years, this agricultural and forestry farm has trained a large number of agricultural cadres, and has also selected seeds and cultivated seedlings for farmers. In this way, it not only helped farmers increase grain production, but also laid the foundation for flood and drought prevention. Walking past Langya Mountain, one can hear the working people happily singing: "New society, new deeds! Langya Mountain has changed! Lang ya hai, ya ho hai!..."

    护仓模范申华池
    编辑同志：湖南省隆回县清水村青年民兵申华池是一个护仓模范。
    申华池在解放前替地主放牛。解放后，他成了清水村护仓委员会的委员。申华池在护仓工作上作出了很大成绩。他护仓的第一个办法，是发动群众、依靠群众，他首先培养了五个积极分子。在他和积极分子的带动和说服动员之下，村中群众都懂得了“公粮保得好，翻身翻得牢”的道理，建立了包括四十个民兵的比较健全的自卫组织。申华池护仓的第二个办法是不辞劳苦，克服困难。民兵们巡逻守夜，申华池查哨。不管风霜雨夜，从不间断。去年除夕夜，天下大雪，寒风刺骨，可是申华池仍在仓库四周整整地守望了一夜。申华池护仓的第三个办法是时刻关心谷子的安全。“天下大雨时，到仓库去检查漏洞”，这是申华池的爱国公约的第一条。有一次，仓库四周遭了水，申华池便和两个民工很快地排掉了水。申华池还时常提出改进工作的意见。清水村的仓谷在申华池的带头保护下，一粒也没有受到损失。
    一九五一年十一月，在全区护仓民兵评功大会上，申华池被评为“特等护仓模范”。民兵同志们一致表示：“要向申华池学习！”

    沙河集人民生活的变化
    编辑同志：津浦铁路沙河集车站附近有两条沙河。河里的黄沙映着太阳，好像黄金一样。解放前，地主、官僚们常来附近欣赏这个美景。可是，沙河附近的劳动人民，却过着苦难的日子。解放后，毛主席号召人民努力生产，沙河区人民政府便以沙河的黄沙为对象，组织沙河集的人民，进行副业生产。沙河的沙，可以供南京等大城市盖房、铺路之用，也可以供修治淮河之用。当地合作社和南京有关单位订了运沙合同。沙河集人民从去年十一月下旬开始搬运河沙。搬运的小车起初只有三十四辆，不到半月，便发展到一百一十辆。一个劳力搬沙，起初每天所得可以维持七、八个人的生活，由于工作情绪的高涨，后来搬沙所得足能维持十五个人的生活。到去年旧历年年底为止，沙河集人民搬沙赚了二亿零四百多万元。那里人民的生活大大改善了。沙河集人民对这一副业生产，都很积极，他们要求合作社和治淮工程领导机关也订立运沙合同，以便扩大和继续这个副业生产。
    沙河集人民搬沙的小车，一辆接一辆，像水流一样。现在真是“沙河变成金”了。

    人民的瑯琊山出现新景象
    编辑同志：在津浦铁路滁县车站西南三里远处，有座瑯琊山，风景幽美，全国驰名。这里，有劳动人民修建起来的“瑯琊寺”、“醉翁亭”等。解放前，每年春秋两季，不少大地主和大官僚们，在搜刮劳动人民的脂膏之后，来这里过荒淫无耻的生活。解放后，瑯琊山变成了人民自己的山。它不但被劳动人民所欣赏享受，而且成为劳动人民发展生产的场所之一了。当地劳动人民在人民政府领导之下，在瑯琊山脚建筑了一个农林场。三年以来，这个农林场培养了大批农业干部，而且替农民选种，培植树苗。这样，不但帮助农民增产了粮食，而且打下了防水、防旱的基础。走过瑯琊山下，可以听到劳动人民在欢快地唱着：“新社会新事迹呀！瑯琊山变了样呀！瑯呀嗨，呀嗬嗨！……”
