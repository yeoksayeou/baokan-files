    Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau
    Should Not Neglect Newspaper Criticism
    Comrade Editor: As I understand it, after the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on March 22nd criticized the phenomenon of medical workers neglecting to read newspapers, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau did not pay sufficient attention to it. In the dozens of units under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, such as hospitals, health clinics, and health work teams, the phenomenon of staff neglecting to read newspapers is very common. The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau has never tried to correct this phenomenon; even after the Party newspaper issued its criticism, they have not followed the advice of the Party newspaper to inspect and improve the newspaper reading situation of medical workers in their affiliated units, and to strengthen cadres' current affairs and political study. This attitude of disregarding newspaper criticism is extremely wrong. I hope that the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau will immediately correct this mistake, and I hope that other relevant leading organs will similarly pay attention to the Party newspaper's call, and thoroughly inspect and improve the situation of cadres in their affiliated units not paying attention to reading newspapers and studying.

    Editor's Note: Reader Xiao Erwen's opinion is correct. We hope that the responsible cadres of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau will immediately pay attention to the current affairs and political education of the staff in their affiliated units and establish newspaper reading work. This is the key to strengthening ideological and political leadership.

    北京市人民政府公共卫生局
    不应该忽视报纸的批评
    编辑同志：据我了解，三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏对医务工作者忽视读报的现象提出批评后，北京市公共卫生局并没有予以足够的注意。北京市公共卫生局领导下的医院、卫生所、卫生工作队等几十个单位中，工作人员忽视读报的现象是很普遍的。对于这种现象，北京市公共卫生局一直没有设法纠正；甚至在党报提出批评以后，他们还没有按照党报所提出的意见，去检查和改进所属单位医务工作者的读报情况，加强干部的时事和政治学习。这种漠视报纸批评的态度，是十分错误的。我希望北京市公共卫生局立即改正这一错误，并希望其他有关领导机关，同样地重视党报的号召，深入检查和改进所属单位的干部不注意读报学习的情况。

    编者按：读者萧尔文的意见是对的。我们希望北京市公共卫生局的负责干部立即重视对所属各单位工作人员的时事政治教育，建立读报工作。这是加强思想领导和政治领导的关键。
