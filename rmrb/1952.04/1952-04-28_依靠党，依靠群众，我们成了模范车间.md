    Relying on the Party, Relying on the Masses, We Became a Model Workshop
    Industrial Labor Model
    Deputy Director of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant
    Wang Guiying
    During the great "Three-Anti" Movement, I accepted the organization's assignment to specifically lead production work. In the first quarter of this year, our Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant made great achievements. In January, we increased the operating rate from 71 percent to 81.2 percent and shortened the smelting time from 8.12 minutes to 7.19 minutes. In February, we exceeded the monthly task by 5.46 percent. In March, we exceeded the monthly task by 9.4 percent. Therefore, our Steelmaking Department was unanimously recognized by the entire plant as a model workshop. Why were we able to achieve such results? I believe the main reason is that we relied on the leadership of the Party and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses. In 1951, we did not tell the masses about the production tasks. The masses did not know what their tasks were, so they could not consciously bring into play their enthusiasm and creativity. In summarizing the production work in 1951, we made a profound self-criticism of this style of not relying on the masses. The reason we were able to formulate a plan to increase production and practice economy by 64 billion yuan in 1952 was that we mobilized all employees to calculate carefully and find the key points. During the intense "Three-Anti" Movement, we insisted on convening the factory management committee and held a staff representative meeting once a month. Through the factory management committee and the staff representative meeting, we handed over the production tasks to the masses, so that everyone knew their goals. In March, we reduced the cost per ton of steel by 100,200 yuan compared to the original target. We regularly go to the site to check on the production situation, discuss opinions on production work every day, and publicize these situations and opinions to the masses. We correctly estimated the improvement of the masses' awareness in the "Three-Anti" struggle. Therefore, through the Technical Research Committee, we mobilized employees to put forward 32 rationalization proposals, saving a large amount of wealth for the country. We also assembled a high cart that was better than foreign goods, forcefully refuting the erroneous argument that "high carts must use foreign goods." When the workers saw this high cart assembled by themselves, they all ran to touch and look at it. Our victory encourages us to continue to advance victoriously. We must create more brilliant achievements to welcome "May Day" and maintain the glorious title of our model workshop.

    依靠党，依靠群众，我们成了模范车间
    工业劳动模范
    太原钢铁厂炼钢部副主任
    王贵英
    在伟大的“三反”运动中，我接受了组织的分配，专门领导生产工作。在今年第一季度生产中，我们太原钢铁厂炼钢部做出了很大成绩。一月份我们把作业率由百分之七十一增加到百分之八十一点二，把冶炼时间由八点十二分缩短到七点十九分。二月份超额完成了全月任务的百分之五点四六。三月份又超额完成了全月任务的百分之九点四。因此，我们炼钢部被全厂一致公认为模范车间。我们为什么能够做出这样的成绩呢？我认为主要的原因是我们依靠了党的领导，发挥了工人群众的积极性和创造性。一九五一年，我们没有把生产任务告诉群众，群众不知道自己任务是什么，就不能自觉地发挥积极性和创造性。在总结一九五一年的生产工作时，我们对于这种不依靠群众的作风，做了深刻的检讨。我们所以能订出了一九五二年增产节约六百四十亿元的计划，就是因为我们发动了全体职工算细账，找窍门。在紧张的“三反”运动中，我们坚持召开了工厂管理委员会，并且每月召开一次职工代表会。通过工厂管理委员会和职工代表会，我们把生产任务交给了群众，使得每个人都知道自己的奋斗目标。在三月份，我们把每吨钢的成本比原订额降低了十万零二千元。我们经常到现场检查生产情况，每天商量对于生产工作的意见，并且把这些情况和意见公布给群众看，我们正确地估计了在“三反”斗争中群众觉悟的提高，因此，通过技术研究委员会，发动职工提出了三十二条合理化建议，为国家节省了大量财富。我们又装配了一辆比外国货好的高车，有力地驳斥了有些人的“高车非用外国货不行”的错误论调。工友们看见这辆自己装配的高车，都跑去摸摸看看。我们的胜利，鼓舞着我们继续胜利前进。我们一定要创造更辉煌的成就，迎接“五一”，保持我们模范车间的光荣称号。
