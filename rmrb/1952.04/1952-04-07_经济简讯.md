    Economic Briefs
    ▲ The Central China Sub-Bureau of the Communist Party of China recently instructed all localities that in order to ensure the organized and planned completion of fertilizer supply work and lay the foundation for increased agricultural production, party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, quickly establish and improve local fertilizer supply agencies, and assign dedicated personnel to be responsible. All localities should immediately revise the fertilizer supply and allocation plans. If there is an uneven supply and demand, each special district should coordinate and adjust on its own. Where fertilizer prices are inappropriate, the viewpoint of pure profit-seeking should be opposed, prices should be re-examined and determined, striving for fairness and reasonableness, timely sales, and striving for farmers to purchase quickly, pre-purchase, and purchase more to increase production.
    ▲ State-owned trade departments in Yunnan Province are vigorously developing business operations. To cooperate with spring plowing production, the state-owned trading company in Kunming has processed and manufactured 3,000 hoes and 1,000 waterwheels. In the three special districts of Baoshan, Wuding, and Qujing, it has purchased 150,000 jin of iron to manufacture agricultural tools. In the six special districts of Wenshan, Yiliang, etc., it has purchased 1.2 million jin of oil cake, which will be continuously supplied to farmers. The state-owned tea company has begun to purchase spring tea in tea-producing counties such as Shunning. In order to stabilize prices and ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing production, the state-owned grain company has launched grain allocation work throughout the province.
    ▲ Ziyang, Ankang, Baihe and other ten counties in southern Shaanxi Province, with undulating hills and a mild climate, are the northernmost tea-producing areas in China, with a maximum annual output of 1.5 million jin. However, due to the devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit gangs, the annual output was only over 800,000 jin before liberation in 1949. In the autumn of 1950, after the establishment of the Ankang Office of the China Tea Company, in addition to large-scale purchases, it also strengthened the acceptance and packaging work, and re-established the reputation of southern Shaanxi tea in the vast areas of the Northwest, opening up sales channels. Last year, the tea output in southern Shaanxi recovered to more than 900,000 jin. In order to further increase production and improve quality, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 73.9 million yuan in loans this year to help tea farmers purchase fertilizers and improve processing, and it is estimated that this year's output will reach 1.2 million jin.
    ▲ With the tea picking season approaching, Hunan is mobilizing tea farmers to turn the soil, fertilize, prune, and remove pests in tea gardens to strive for a bumper harvest. Under the leadership of the Tea Production Research Association of Tangdeng Township, Pingjiang, tea farmers in the township have carried out soil turning, fertilization, pruning, and pest control work on more than 800 mu of tea gardens, and it is estimated that this year's red tea production will increase at least one time compared to last year. The Hunan Branch of the China Tea Company is training tea purchasing cadres to prepare for purchases.
    In the past two years, tea farmers in Hunan have reclaimed and cultivated more than 680,000 mu of tea gardens. The province's tea output has increased by 54% compared with pre-liberation levels. Changsha, Pingjiang, Anhua and other eleven counties have also established new-style tea gardens with a total area of more than 2,000 mu. In order to support tea farmers and increase tea production, the Hunan Provincial People's Government has issued loans totaling more than 10 billion yuan in the past two years.

    经济简讯
    ▲中共中央华南分局最近指示各地为了保证有组织、有计划地完成肥料供应工作，打下农业增产基础，各级党委必须加强领导，迅速建立和健全各地肥料供应机构，指派专人负责。各地应即修正肥料供应和调拨的计划，如有供求不匀，各专区应自行统筹调整。肥料价格不当的地方，应反对单纯营利观点，重新审核定价，务求公平合理，及时销售，争取农民速购、预购、多购，以增加生产。
    ▲云南省国营贸易部门大力开展业务工作。为配合春耕生产，国营贸易公司在昆明已加工制造锄头三千把、水车一千部，在保山、武定、曲靖三个专区已收购了十五万斤铁，以制造农具，在文山、宜良等六个专区已收购一百二十万斤油饼，将不断地供应农民。国营茶业公司已开始在顺宁等产茶县份收购春茶。为稳定物价，保证春耕生产的顺利进行，国营粮食公司已在全省范围内展开粮食调拨工作。
    ▲陕西省南部紫阳、安康、白河等十县，境内丘陵起伏，气候温和，为我国最北部的产茶区，最高产量一年曾达一百五十万斤。但由于蒋、胡匪帮的摧残，到一九四九年解放前夕，年产量仅达八十余万斤。一九五零年秋，中国茶业公司安康办事处成立后，除大量收购外，并加强了验收和包装工作，重新恢复了陕南茶叶在西北广大地区的信誉，打开了销路。去年陕南茶叶产量就恢复到九十万斤以上。为了进一步增加产量和提高质量，今年陕西省人民政府已拨下贷款七千三百九十多万元，扶助茶农购置肥料和改良加工，预计今年产量可达一百二十万斤。
    ▲采茶季节将到，湖南各地正发动茶农对茶园翻土、施肥、整枝、除虫，争取丰收。平江汤塅乡茶农在该乡茶叶生产研究会领导下，已有八百多亩茶园进行了翻土、施肥、整枝、除虫等工作，估计今年至少可较去年增产红茶一倍。中国茶业公司湖南分公司正在训练购茶干部，准备收购。
    两年来，湖南茶农先后垦复和整理茶园达六十八万多亩。全省茶叶产量已较解放前增加百分之五十四。长沙、平江、安化等十一县并已建立有总面积达两千多亩的新式茶园。为了扶持茶农，增加茶叶的生产，两年来，湖南省人民政府先后发放的贷款，已达一百多亿元。
