    Last Phase of the Shu-Yi River Project Fully Underway to Permanently Eradicate Flooding for Five Million People in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu

    The final phase of the Shu-Yi River Project commenced fully on April 5th. Over 180,000 laborers and technicians from twenty counties and cities in central and southern Shandong are working with great enthusiasm along the banks of the Shu and Yi Rivers, spanning over 200 kilometers.

    To eliminate the long-standing disasters caused by floods from the Shu and Yi Rivers, the Communist Party and the People's Government mobilized a large amount of manpower and resources as early as the spring of 1949, during the tense period of the Liberation War, and began the construction of the Shu River diversion project. In 1951, the Yi River rectification project was carried out simultaneously with the Shu River diversion. Over the past three years, the Shu River project has undergone six phases, and the Yi River project has undergone two phases, mobilizing a total of more than 790,000 laborers. Using crude labor tools, they overcame various difficulties, worked more than 37 million workdays, and excavated 30,076,500 cubic meters of earth and more than 3 million cubic meters of stone. In the fault foothills of Maling Mountain, they opened up a new river channel; on the flat riverbanks, they built long embankments stretching over 330 li. By the winter of last year, most of the project was completed. The unfinished portions must be substantially completed before the flood season in June this year. By then, this great struggle to transform nature will have achieved final victory, the floods of the Shu and Yi Rivers will flow into the new channels, and the long-suffering flood damage to five million people in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong will be permanently eliminated, laying the foundation for further management of the Grand Canal, Si River, and Wen River, and the undertaking of other water conservancy projects.

    The construction sections of this phase of the project are extremely widely distributed, and the complexity and arduousness of the tasks exceed any previous phase.

    The Shu River side of the project includes: constructing water retaining dams, spillway weirs, forty-four culverts, ceramic pipes, and sluice gates, building dikes and blocking dams at the Linhong River, digging drainage ditches, and building weirs around villages along the river. The Yi River side of the project includes: excavating new river channels, dredging old river channels, building new dikes, reinforcing old dikes, and blocking dams at the Chenghekou. The retaining dams, spillway weirs, and Chenghekou dam blockage are all key to the entire Shu River diversion and Yi River rectification project. The retaining dam is 1.6 kilometers long, the dam base is 100 meters wide, and it is 9 meters high. A section was built during construction last winter, and this phase will complete the entire dam. Before the flood season arrives, the water of the old Shu River will be diverted into the new river channel, so it will not harm the downstream farmland. The spillway weir is the first large-scale water conservancy project in Shandong Province, requiring 27,900 cubic meters of cut stone, 2.1 million catties of cement, and 380,000 catties of lime, and requiring the excavation of 655,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. After this project is completed, when the Shu River flood reaches 4,500 flow units, 1,700 flow units will overflow from here into the old Shu River. This will reduce the burden on the new Shu River channel, ensure the safety of the dikes, and facilitate the irrigation of farmland along the banks of the old Shu River in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. The Chenghekou dam blockage needs to be carried out in deep water and must be completed before May 20 to safely pass the flood season.

    Part of this phase of the project started in early and mid-March (such as the construction of retaining dams and spillway weirs), and most of it started on April 5th. The mighty army of river management has arrived at the construction site in an organized and orderly manner. On the 200-kilometer-long river management front, from Linhong River Estuary in the east to Caoqiao Station in the middle reaches of the Yi River in the west, 160,272 laborers and more than 27,000 technicians are engaged in the intense battle to transform nature. They have full confidence in completing the task on schedule. The Feixian County laborers, who have won the title of model unit three times in the Shu River diversion and Yi River rectification, have exceeded the standard in average work efficiency six days after the official start of construction of the retaining dam. The entire team is further improving labor organization and raising ideological awareness to strive to complete the task ahead of schedule. More than 1,000 technicians from Xin Hailian City are working hard to cut stone and pour foundation trenches; they have enough confidence to complete the spillway weir project on schedule. The laborers of Cangshan County put the award flags they won in the Shu River diversion and Yi River rectification on their vehicles and said with a smile: "We'll carry new ones back this year." Thousands of cadres participating in the project are also serving the project with selfless dedication. They work day and night, forgetting sleep and food, educating the laborers, guiding the progress of the project, and transporting materials to the construction site.

    The leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, as well as the support of the broad masses of the people, have strengthened the confidence of all employees; the beautiful prospects on both sides of the Yi and Shu Rivers have inspired the enthusiasm of the employees. They are working hard for the complete victory of the Shu River diversion and Yi River rectification project. (Dazhong Daily)

### 为鲁南苏北五百万人民永远根除水患  最后一期导沭整沂工程全线开工

    为鲁南苏北五百万人民永远根除水患
    最后一期导沭整沂工程全线开工
    最后一期导沭整沂工程已于四月五日全线开工。来自鲁中南二十个县、市的十八万多民工、技术工人，正热情充沛地劳动在二百余公里长的沭河、沂河两岸。
    为了根除沭河、沂河洪水长期带给人民的灾难，共产党和人民政府早在一九四九年春季，正当解放战争的紧张进行的时候，就动员了大批的人力、物力，开始了导治沭河的建设工程。一九五一年又和导沭的同时，进行了整沂工程。三年来，导沭工程已进行了六期，整沂工程进行了两期；共动员民工七十九万多人。他们使用着粗笨的劳动工具，克服了种种困难，劳动了三千七百多万个工日，计挖掘土方三千零七十六万五千公方，石方三百多万公方；在马陵山的断麓，开成了新的河道；在平坦的河岸上，筑成了绵延三百三十余里的长堤。到去年冬季为止，整个工程大部完成。未完部分，则必须在今年六月底汛期前基本完成。到那时，这一改造自然的伟大斗争，将获得最后胜利，沭河、沂河洪水将流入新河道，苏北、鲁南五百万人民长期遭受的水害，将永远免除；并为进一步治理运河、泗河、汶河，举办其他水利工程打下基础。
    本期工程工段分布极广，任务的复杂艰巨，超过以往任何一期。
    沭河方面工程有：修筑拦水坝、溢水堰、四十四处涵洞、陶管、泄水闸，临洪河筑堤堵坝，挖排水沟，沿河村庄修围堰等。沂河方面工程有：开挖新河道，挖探旧河道，筑新堤，培旧堤，城河口堵坝等。拦河坝、溢水堰、城河口堵坝都是导沭和整沂整个工程的关键。拦河坝长一点六公里，坝基宽一百公尺，有九公尺高，去冬施工时已筑了一段，本期将全部筑成。在汛期来到前，老沭河的水将被拦入新河道，不致再危害下游的农田。溢水堰是山东省水利建设上的第一个大工程，需用二万七千九百公方条块石，二百一十万斤水泥，三十八万斤石灰，要挖土方、石方六十五万五千公方。这个工程完成后，当沭河洪水达四千五百个流量时，有一千七百个流量从这里溢入老沭河。这样既减轻了沭河新河道的负担，保证了堤坝的安全，又便利了鲁南、苏北老沭河两岸农民利用河水灌溉。城河口堵坝需要在深水中进行，并必须在五月二十日前完成，以安度汛期。
    本期部分工程在三月初旬、下旬就已开工（例如修建拦河坝、溢水堰工程），大部在四月五日开工。浩浩荡荡的治河大军，已先后有组织有秩序地到达工地。在东起临洪河口，西至沂河中游草桥车站，全长二百余公里的治河战线上，十六万零二百七十二名民工，二万七千多名技术工人，正在紧张地进行着改造自然的战斗。他们有充分的信心按期完成任务。导沭、整沂中三次荣获模范单位称号的费县民工，在正式开工修筑拦河坝六天后，平均工作效率已超过标准。全队正进一步改进劳动组织，提高思想觉悟，争取提前完成任务。来自新海连市的一千多名技术工人，正在紧张地打块石、灌基槽；他们有足够的信心按期完成溢水堰工程。苍山县的民工把以往在导沭、整沂中得的奖旗插在车上，笑着说：“今年咱们再扛新的回去。”参加工程的数千干部也正以忘我的精神为工程服务。他们废寝忘食，向民工进行教育，指导工程的进行，日夜兼程向工地调运器材。
    共产党和人民政府的领导以及广大人民的支援，坚定了全体员工的信心；沂河、沭河两岸的美好远景，振奋着员工的情绪。他们正为导沭、整沂工程的全胜而努力。    （大众日报）
