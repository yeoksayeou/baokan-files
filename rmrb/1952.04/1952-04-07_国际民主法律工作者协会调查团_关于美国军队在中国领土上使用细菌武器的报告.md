International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team
Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by the United States Army on Chinese Territory

I. Introduction

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers entrusted this investigation team to investigate the acts of the U.S. military in Korea that violated international law. This team consists of legal professionals from eight countries, listed as follows:

Head: Brandweiner, Professor of International Law at the University of Graz (Austria)
Deputy Head: Cavalieri, Lawyer of the High Court (Italy)
Members: Gaster, London Lawyer (United Kingdom)
          Jasgey, Lawyer of the Paris Court (France)
          Ke Bonian, Deputy Director of the Research Committee of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (China)
          Morens, Lawyer of the Brussels Court (Belgium)
          De Britto, Lawyer of the Rio de Janeiro Court (Brazil)
          Wasilkowska, Judge of the Supreme Court (Poland)

When the investigation team was conducting investigations in Korea, specifically investigating the use of bacteriological weapons against civilians by the U.S. Air Force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China publicly accused the United States of also using bacteriological weapons in the northeastern provinces of China.

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers requested this investigation team to further investigate the facts alleged by the government of the People's Republic of China. To this end, the investigation team went to Northeast China for investigation.

The Chinese government authorities are aware of many cases of the U.S. military spreading bacteria, and the investigation team could not examine all of them, therefore it had to limit itself to examining ten cases that occurred in various parts of southern Northeast China.

The investigation team learned the facts of each case from Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister of the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government, and obtained the testimonies of several witnesses.

In addition, the investigation team also listened to the testimonies of many experts in bacteriology, entomology, pathology, neurology, and medicine, who provided the investigation team with the results of tests, assays, and experiments. The names and resumes of the experts are as follows:

Chen Shixiang, Bachelor of Science from Fudan University, Shanghai (1928), Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Paris, France (1934), Director of the Entomology Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Deputy Director of the Aurora Museum, Shanghai.
Qin Yaoting, Graduate of Qilu University (1914), Director of the Department of Biology, China Medical University, Shenyang.
Xin Jun, Doctor of Medicine from Nagoya Imperial University, Japan, Chief Technician of the Northeast Institute for the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
Jing Guanhua, Bachelor of Medicine from Nanman Medical College (1942), Associate Professor and Acting Director of the Department of Bacteriology, China Medical University, Shenyang.
Lu Baolin, Associate Professor of the Department of Entomology, Beijing Agricultural University.
Zhu Jiming, Bachelor of Medicine from Shanghai Medical College (1939), Doctor of Philosophy from Cambridge University, England, Chief Technician of the Central Biological Products Institute, Beijing.
Li Peilin, Member of the British and Irish Pathology Society, Professor of Pathology, China Medical University, Shenyang.
Wu Zhizhong, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, England, Professor of Internal Medicine, China Medical University, Shenyang.
Zhang Xuede, Doctor of Medicine from Peking Union Medical College, Master of Science from the University of Illinois, USA, Professor of Peking Union Medical College.
Xu Yingkui, Doctor of Medicine, who worked at the Munich Institute for Psychological Research (1938), Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, Peking Union Medical College.

Finally, General Gao Peng, Deputy Commander of Northeast Air Defense, reported to the investigation team the dates and locations of U.S. aircraft appearances observed by the intelligence agencies of his department. He also proved that there were no Chinese aircraft in the airspace at these locations at the time, and that the aforementioned aircraft had been proven to be U.S. military aircraft.

The investigation team also received a copy of the May 1947 issue of the "Journal of Immunology," which contained a lengthy report by three American bacteriologists from Columbia University, confirming that the United States had been carefully studying the use of bacteria as weapons of war since that time.

The materials obtained from this have been included in this report.

II. The Truth

1.  On the evening of March 3, 1952, a farmer in Jiuzhan Village, about 20 kilometers from Fushun, discovered insects jumping and crawling on the snow in front of his house. He reported this to the government authorities. In the following days, work was organized to catch and eliminate the insects. These insects were scattered over an area of more than one kilometer (two li) long and about half a kilometer (one li) wide. Residents of the village had never seen such insects before, even in hot weather, and the weather in this area was still extremely cold in early March, and the ice and snow had not yet melted.

Three witnesses, including Liu Guangyi, the farmer who first discovered the insects, explained to the investigation team the circumstances under which the insects were discovered and the circumstances under which insect samples were sent to the government.

Professor Qin Yaoting, after identifying these insects, pointed out that insects of the order Collembola have been scattered in large quantities in Korea and Northeast China.

Dr. Zhu Jiming stated to the investigation team the results of the bacterial experiments conducted by three experts with guinea pigs, which died after eight days, and many rickettsia were found in their spleens, proving that this insect carried rickettsia.

U.S. aircraft flew over the Fushun area on February 29, and two other witnesses positively testified that an air raid alert was issued in Fushun on that day.

2.  On March 4, 1952, clusters of insects were found on the banks of the Laoguan Village River in Benxi (U.S. aircraft had flown over the area on February 29). These insects were scattered in an area about one kilometer (two and a half li) long and about one and a half li wide. There were many types of insects, the main ones being spiders and mosquitoes.

Professor Jing Guanhua pointed out to the investigation team that experiments on white mice and guinea pigs proved that this spider carried bacteria of the genus Pasteurella, to which plague bacteria belong.

On February 29, 1952, military observation agencies saw U.S. aircraft flying over southern Benxi and north and south of Fushun.

3.  Ren Zanyi, a member of the epidemic prevention team, testified to the investigation team that he witnessed several groups of mosquitoes flying in Fanjia Village, Jinzhou on March 5, 1952.

On March 6 and 7, large numbers of mosquitoes, flies, and spiders were found in other areas of Jinzhou, especially on a partially frozen river.

According to the testimony given to the investigation team by Professor Jing Guanhua, these insects were proven to be chironomids and dung flies, carrying typhoid and paratyphoid bacteria.

At 6:00 a.m. on March 4, U.S. aircraft flew over the Jinzhou area.

4.  On March 7, 1952, U.S. aircraft flew over the Fushun area.

On the same day, a railway worker found a large number of flies at a location 10 kilometers from Gujiazai Station, flying on and under the Wulitai Bridge. A few days later, on March 11, he and other workers went to inspect the rails again and found the flies still there, so they captured some and sent them to Shenyang. The weather was very cold at this time, with temperatures below minus 10 degrees Celsius.

The investigation team listened to the testimony of Professor Chen Shixiang. He studied these insects and proved that they were Diptera Anthomyiidae, and he made the following explanation: This type of fly breeds in large numbers in May, but normally cannot survive on snow. Its many hairs are suitable for carrying and spreading bacteria. Professor Chen continued that this type of fly is the same as the ones found behind the Korean front.

5.  Since March 9, 1952, there have been several deaths due to encephalitis in Anshan and other cities.

At 2:00 a.m. on March 2, two U.S. aircraft invaded the Anshan area, and several days later, a large number of mosquitoes were found in the city.

Professor Jing Guanhua testified to the investigation team that, according to experiments, white mice injected with mosquitoes ground into fine powder all died exhibiting encephalitis symptoms, and viruses that could damage brain tissue were found in their brains.

The investigation team also heard the testimony of Ying Huaxin, a doctor from Anshan, who affirmed that the appearance of mosquitoes in the city during this season was extremely abnormal, and presented his reports on March 17 and 18 regarding two patients who exhibited encephalitis symptoms before death.

Many pathology experts reported to the investigation team the results of the post-mortem examinations of the two patients, determining that they suffered from a type of acute encephalitis.

Professor Li Peilin, who participated in the autopsy, emphasized that the destruction of the brain after the death of the patients was similar to the destruction of the brain of white mice found in experiments.

6.  At 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on March 11, 1952, U.S. aircraft invaded the Andong area along the Yalu River twice, each time with four aircraft.

At 11:00 a.m. on the same day, residents of Beijingzi Village heard engine noises and saw aircraft flying from northwest to southeast. They saw the aircraft drop something, but could not determine where it landed. Later, a large number of feathers were found in the fields, mostly white, and some yellow.

Dr. Xin Jun testified to the investigation team that, according to his experiments on white mice, anthrax bacteria were found attached to the feathers.

7.  On the morning of March 12, 1952, eight U.S. aircraft in a batch flew over the Andong and Kuandian areas.

Han Yongbin, the shopkeeper of a general store in Nanmennei, Kuandian, testified to the investigation team that he was at the door of his store when the aircraft flew over around noon that day. The aircraft flew very high, from west to east, and the weather was extremely clear. He heard engine noises and saw white smoke coming from the tail of the aircraft. Han Yongbin then saw the aircraft drop something, white, shaped like a long tube, which landed approximately in the eastern part of the city.

On March 21, Li Sijian, a student at Kuandian Middle School who participated in the government-organized insect search work, found a four-inch deep crater in a cornfield one kilometer east of the city. There were many fragments of shrapnel next to the crater, grayish-white inside and silvery-gray outside, and a steel bar three meters away, with a metal disc at one end. He also testified to the investigation team that chicken feathers were found near the crater, short ones yellow and white, long ones black. Based on the number and different colors of the feathers, it was determined that they came from many chickens, but no poultry bones were found nearby. Li Sijian also saw many living flies, the names of which he did not recognize, which would not normally survive in this area.

He gave the shrapnel and some of the feathers to his teacher, and believed that these fragments were fragments of a bacteriological bomb. He captured and burned these insects, leaving only a portion of the samples to be sent to the government.

The investigation team personally witnessed the bomb fragments and feathers found in Kuandian. The examination of these fragments and feathers is currently underway. The injected white mice have died, but the bacteria have not yet been isolated.

8.  On March 15, 1952, at approximately 9:30 p.m., a soldier of the guard team of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau saw "two flashes of white light in the air and luminous objects" falling towards the Maluwan area while on duty in the southern district of the city, with an interval of four to five seconds, but no explosions were heard. Another soldier also saw the same situation.

There was no air raid alert that time. However, the head of the city's air defense intelligence group told the investigation team that he knew that U.S. aircraft had flown over. In addition, General Gao Peng proved that he discovered U.S. aircraft at 9:00 p.m., and the military authorities received reports.

Li Shangping (female), chairman of the trade union of the Ministry of Trade and director of the ministry's epidemic prevention committee, gave the investigation team a report dated March 18. She confirmed that the report was written by her. The report described the process of two hundred employees of the ministry searching for poisonous insects on March 15 and 16. They collected large amounts of various insects in the building and its vicinity, especially flies and locusts. The appearance of such insects in the city at this time was completely abnormal.

She also pointed out that the epidemic prevention committee of the Ministry of Trade was established on March 9, 1952, and the ministry carried out full disinfection work from March 9 to March 13. Before the evening of March 15, no such insects were found.

Three experts testified to the investigation team regarding this case.

Professor Chen Shixiang proved that this locust's scientific name is Locustamlgratojia. In Shenyang, this insect usually dies in late autumn or early winter after laying its eggs, and the eggs do not hatch until May or June of the following year. According to Professor Chen, the living locusts found in Shenyang on March 15 could not have come from the local area.

Professor Lu Baolin found that the flies were Musca domestica, larger than houseflies. It is a vector of infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid. This type of fly particularly lives in warm areas. Experts believe that it is impossible for this type of fly to survive outdoors in large numbers at this time and place.

Professor Jing Guanhua pointed out that the captured flies carried typhoid bacteria.

9.  On March 17, 1952, a resident of Siping City found flies outside the village, and a systematic search was carried out the next day, and a large number of clustered flies were found.

Professor Qin Yaoting testified to the investigation team after examining many of these flies that this type of fly belongs to the housefly family and usually cannot survive on snowy fields in winter. Preliminary test results have found that this type of fly carries anthrax bacteria.

General Gao Peng told the investigation team that he had not received any reports regarding U.S. aircraft flying over the area on March 17 or in the days before this.

10. On March 19, 1952, a railway worker at Tieling Station found swarms of mosquitoes flying in front of the station and in various parts of the station building. The temperature that day was minus 10 degrees Celsius.

Professor Qin Yaoting examined some of the mosquitoes and confirmed that they were Aedes koreicus. He told the investigation team that this type of mosquito usually only appears in late May in Northeast China. Tests are currently underway to determine whether this type of mosquito carries bacteria.

A U.S. aircraft flew over the area at 9:00 p.m. on March 15.

III. Conclusion

Based on the documents and testimonies it has collected, the investigation team believes that the following facts have been established:

1.  In mid-March 1952, the abnormal appearance of various insects was discovered and confirmed in various parts of southern Northeast China (most of which are far from the Korean border).

2.  In all cases, the appearance of these insects is abnormal, especially from the point of view of the season, temperature, and the fact that the insects are only concentrated in limited areas.

3.  In most cases, feathers were also found at the scene, and the appearance of these feathers cannot be considered natural.

4.  In most cases, the results of tests and experiments with guinea pigs and mice have proven that these insects and feathers carry various pathogens: Pasteurella bacteria, anthrax bacteria, typhoid bacteria, paratyphoid bacteria, rickettsia, and encephalitis viruses.

5.  In the nine cases reviewed by the investigation team, it was proven that U.S. aircraft had flown over these areas on the same day or in the days before the discovery of insects or feathers.

6.  In many cases, witnesses saw these aircraft drop things, and in one case, fragments of a container that was apparently used to hold insects were found.

7.  Although the epidemic prevention measures taken by the authorities have so far eliminated the risk of disease outbreaks, 17 people have died due to infection by bacteria-carrying insects.

The investigation team believes that these bacteria-carrying insects and feathers could only have been brought into these areas by U.S. aircraft, and U.S. aircraft have no right or reason to fly into Chinese Northeast territory.

The facts obtained by the investigation team during its investigation in Korea make this conclusion even stronger. The report made after the investigation in Korea specifically pointed out that fragments of a special bomb were found, with English words on these fragments, and it was proven that the U.S. military was spreading bacteria-carrying insects in Korea. Many of the bacteria-carrying insects found in China are the same as those found in Korea.

The use of bacteriological weapons is prohibited by the laws and customs of war. The Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, affirmed this prohibition. When armed conflict does not exist, this prohibition is of course even more applicable.

The statute of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal declared the killing or extermination of civilians to be a crime against humanity, regardless of whether it is committed in a state of war or in a state of peace.

The "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," adopted on December 9, 1948, affirmatively applies to anyone who deliberately carries out or attempts to carry out massacres or serious injuries to a population with the intent to destroy all or part of a nation or race, whether in wartime or peacetime.

We believe that the facts reported above constitute an act of aggression and genocide by the United States, as well as a heinous crime against humanity. Therefore, this has indeed become an extremely serious threat to the entire world; its scope and consequences are unpredictable.

Our firm opinion is based on facts, which we have verified with the rigor of legal work and our sense of responsibility.

As legal scholars, we lodge a solemn protest against this act in violation of international law.

As democrats, we condemn this act of aggression that threatens world peace.

As ordinary men and women, we express our indignation at this appalling use of scientific progress for wicked purposes.

This report was written in French and signed by all members of this investigation team in Beijing on April 2, 1952.

    当调查团在朝鲜进行调查，特别调查美国空军对平民使用细菌武器时，中华人民共和国政府外交部公开控诉美国亦在中国东北各省使用细菌武器。
    国际民主法律工作者协会要求本调查团进而调查中华人民共和国政府所指控的事实。为此目的调查团曾赴中国东北进行调查。
    中国政府当局业已获悉的美军撒布细菌的案例甚多，调查团无法全部审查，因此不得不仅限于审查发生于中国东北南部各地的十件。
    调查团已由东北人民政府卫生部副部长白希清处获悉各案例的事实，且已获得若干证人的证词。
    此外调查团也听取了许多细菌学、昆虫学、病理学、脑系病学及医学专家的证词，他们向调查团提供了检验、化验、及实验的结果。各位专家的姓名及简历如下：

    许英魁，医学博士，曾在慕尼黑心理研究学会从事研究工作（一九三八），北京协和医学院精神病及心理学系教授。
    最后，东北防空副司令高鹏将军向调查团报告该部情报机构经观察所知美国飞机出现的日期及地点。他又证明当时在这些地点的上空并无中国飞机，而上述飞机已被证明是美国军用飞机。
    调查团更收到一本一九四七年五月号的“免疫杂志”，内有哥仑比亚大学三位美国细菌学家的长篇报告，证实从那时起美国即已仔细研究将细菌用作战争武器。
    由此所获的材料已列入本报告内。
    二、事实真象
    1、一九五二年三月三日傍晚，距抚顺约二十公里的旧站村某农民，在他家门前发现有虫子在雪地上跳和爬。他将此事报告了政府当局。此后数日就组织了捕灭虫子的工作。这些昆虫散布的面积长达一公里余（二华里），宽约半公里（一华里）。该村居民以前甚至在热天也从未见过此种昆虫，而这一带三月初的天气仍极为寒冷，冰雪亦尚未融化。
    三位证人，包括首先发现虫子的农民刘广义，向调查团说明了昆虫被发现时的情况以及昆虫样品送交政府时的情况。
    秦耀庭教授对这些昆虫作过鉴定后指出，在朝鲜和中国东北此种属弹尾目（Collembola）的昆虫已被大量撒布。
    朱既明博士向调查团陈述三位专家以豚鼠作的细菌试验的结果，这些豚鼠于八日后死去，脾中发现有许多立克次氏小体，证明此种昆虫带有立克次氏小体。
    美国飞机曾于二月二十九日飞过抚顺地区，另外两位证人肯定地证明当日抚顺曾发出空袭警报。
    2、一九五二年三月四日本溪老官村河岸边（二月二十九日美机曾飞过该处）发现麇集的昆虫。这些昆虫散布在长约一公里余（二华里半），宽约一华里半的地区。昆虫种类甚多，其中主要者为蜘蛛和蚊子。
    景冠华教授向调查团指出，施于小白鼠及豚鼠的实验，证明此种蜘蛛带有巴斯德杆菌属的细菌，而鼠疫菌即属此类。
    一九五二年二月二十九日，军事观察机构在本溪南部及抚顺南北曾见美机飞过。
    3、防疫队队员任赞义向调查团作证称，一九五二年三月五日他曾在锦州范家村目睹数群蚊虫飞着。
    三月六日及七日锦州其他地区，特别是在一条部分冻着的河上发现有大量蚊、蝇及蜘蛛。
    根据景冠华教授向调查团所作之证言，这些昆虫被证明是摇蚊和粪蝇，带有伤寒菌及副伤寒菌。
    三月四日晨六时，锦州地区有美机飞过。
    4、一九五二年三月七日美机飞过抚顺地区。
    同日，某铁路工人在距孤家子车站十公里处发现有大批苍蝇，这些苍蝇系在五里台桥上和桥下飞着。数日后，即三月十一日，他与其他工人又至该处巡视铁轨，发现苍蝇仍在彼处，乃捕捉数只送往沈阳。此时气候甚冷，温度在摄氏零下十度。
    调查团听取了陈世骧教授的证言。他研究了这些昆虫，证明是双翅目花蝇，他并作如下之说明：此种苍蝇于五月间大量滋生，但平常不能在雪上生存。其毛多，适于带菌及撒布细菌。陈教授继称，此种苍蝇与在朝鲜战线后方发现者相同。
    5、自一九五二年三月九日起，鞍山及其他城市中因脑炎致死者已有多起。
    三月二日晨二时，两架美机侵入鞍山地区，数日后即在城中发现大量蚊虫。
    景冠华教授向调查团作证称，根据实验，将蚊子磨成细粉注射入小白鼠，均呈脑炎病状死去，其脑内发现有能损害脑组织之病毒。
    调查团还听取了鞍山医师英化新的作证，他肯定在此季节城中出现蚊子极不正常，并出示其在三月十七日及十八日所作关于两位病人死前有脑炎病状的报告。
    许多病理学专家向调查团报告了两位病人的死后解剖结果，断定系患一种急性脑炎。
    参加解剖尸体的李佩琳教授强调病者死后脑的破坏情况与实验中所发现小白鼠的脑的破坏情况类似。
    6、一九五二年三月十一日上午八时及十一时，美机两次沿鸭绿江侵入安东地区，每次各四架。
    当日上午十一时，北井子村居民曾听见引擎声并看见飞机自西北飞向东南。他们看见飞机抛下一物，但未能确定落在何处。后来，发现在田野中有大量羽毛，多为白色，亦有黄色的。
    辛钧博士对调查团作证称，根据其对小白鼠所作实验，发现羽毛上附有炭疽菌。
    7、一九五二年三月十二日晨，美机八架一批飞过安东、宽甸地区。
    宽甸南门内杂货店掌柜韩永斌对调查团作证称，当日正午前飞机飞过时他正在店门口。飞机飞得很高，自西向东，天气极明朗。他听见引擎声并看见机尾排出白烟。韩永斌继又看见飞机扔下一物，白色，形似长筒，约落在城的东部。
    三月二十一日，参加政府号召的搜虫工作的宽甸中学学生李思俭，在城东一公里外的玉蜀黍的地里发现一四寸深的弹坑。弹坑旁有许多弹片，内为灰白色、外为银灰色，三公尺外有一钢条，钢条一端有一金属圆板。他并对调查团作证称，弹坑附近发见有鸡毛，短者为黄色、白色，长者为黑色。根据羽毛数量及不同的颜色判断，是出自许多鸡上，但附近未见有任何禽类骨骼。李思俭还看见许多不识何名的活的苍蝇，在正常情况下，不会在此地区生存。
    他把弹片和一些羽毛交给了他的老师，并认为这些弹片是细菌弹之碎片。他捕捉并烧死了这些昆虫，只留下其中一部分样品送交政府。
    调查团亲自目睹在宽甸发现的炸弹碎片和羽毛。对这些弹片及羽毛的检验现正在进行中。被注射的小白鼠已死，但尚未把细菌分离出来。
    8、一九五二年三月十五日约二十一点三十分钟时，沈阳公安部警卫队一战士在该城南区值班站岗，看到“空中闪了两下白光并有发光物体”向马路湾一带下落，相隔四、五秒钟，但未闻爆炸声。另一战士亦见到同样情况。
    那次没有放警报。但该城防空情报组长告诉调查团，当时知有美国飞机飞来。此外，高鹏将军证明他于二十一点钟发现美机，军事当局并得到报告。
    贸易部工会主席及该部防疫委员会主任李尚平（女）交给调查团三月十八日的报告一份。她证实该报告是她所写的。报告叙述三月十五、十六两日该部两百职工搜寻毒虫的经过。他们于大楼及其邻近地区搜集了大量的各种各样的昆虫，其中苍蝇与蝗虫特多。此类虫子在这个时期在城中出现是完全反常的。
    她又指出贸易部防疫委员会系于一九五二年三月九日成立，三月九日至十三日该部进行了全部消毒工作，在三月十五号晚上以前，并无发见任何此类昆虫。
    关于此案有三位专家向调查团作证。
    陈世骧教授证明此种蝗虫学名为Locustamlgratojia。在沈阳此种昆虫在下卵后通常于秋末或冬初死去，虫卵要至次年五、六月才孵化。据陈教授意见，三月十五日在沈阳发见的活的蝗虫不可能来自本地。
    陆宝麟教授发现苍蝇为大家蝇，比家蝇较大。它是霍乱、痢疾、伤寒、副伤寒等传染病的媒介。这种苍蝇特别生存于温暖地区。专家们认为此时此地这种苍蝇大量在户外生存是不可能的。
    景冠华教授指出：捕到的苍蝇带有伤寒菌。
    9、一九五二年三月十七日，四平市一居民在村外发见苍蝇，翌日即进行系统的搜查，并发见麇集的苍蝇甚多。
    秦耀庭教授于检查许多这些苍蝇之后，向调查团作证说，此种蝇属家蝇类，通常不能在冬季田野雪地上生存。初步检验结果，已发见此种苍蝇带有炭疽菌。
    高鹏将军告诉调查团说，关于在三月十七日或在此以前数日有美国飞机飞过该区之任何报告，他未接到。
    10、一九五二年三月十九日，铁岭车站一铁路工人在车站前面以及站房各处发现成群的蚊子飞着，那天的温度是摄氏零下十度。
    秦耀庭教授检查一部分蚊子，证实其为高丽豹脚蚊。他对调查团说，此种蚊虫在中国东北通常仅在五月末方才出现。关于此种蚊虫是否带有细菌的试验现正在进行中。
    美国飞机一架于三月十五日二十一时飞过该区。
    三、结论
    调查团根据其搜集的文件及证词，认为下列事实，业已成立：
    1、一九五二年三月中，中国东北的南部各地（大部分距朝鲜边境甚远）发现了而且证实了各种昆虫的反常出现。
    2、在所有案例中，这些昆虫的出现都是反常的，尤其是从季节、气温、及从虫子仅集中于有限地区几点看来，更显见其反常。
    3、在多数案例中，出事地点也发现了羽毛，这些羽毛的出现，是不能认为自然的。
    4、在大多数案例中，化验的结果及用豚鼠和小鼠实验的结果，证明了这些昆虫及羽毛带有各种病菌：巴斯德杆菌、炭疽菌、伤寒菌、副寒伤菌、立克次氏小体及脑炎病毒。
    5、在调查团审查的九件案例中，美机曾于发现昆虫或羽毛的当天或前几天，飞经这些地区，是被证实了的。
    6、在许多案例中，证人曾见到这些飞机投下东西，在一件案例中，找到了显然是装昆虫用的容器的碎片。
    7、当局所采取之防疫措施，至今为止，虽已消除了疾病流行之危险，但仍有十七人由于带菌昆虫的传染而致死亡。
    调查团认为：这些带菌的昆虫及羽毛只能是美国飞机运入这些地区来的，而美机既无权利，亦无任何理由飞入中国东北领土。
    从调查团在朝鲜调查时所得的事实得到这样的一个结论，这结论就更有力量。在朝鲜调查后所作之报告，特别指出发现了一个特别炸弹之碎片，这些碎片上有英文字，而且证实了美军在朝鲜撒布带菌的昆虫。在中国所发现之带菌的昆虫，许多是与在朝鲜所发现的相同。
    使用细菌武器乃为战争法规及惯例所禁止。一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书肯定了此项禁令。当武装冲突并不存在时，此项禁令当然更为适用。
    纽伦堡国际军事法庭的法规宣称杀害或消灭平民为反对人类的罪行，不分这是在战争状态或在和平状态时所为。
    凡蓄意毁灭一个民族或种族的全部或一部分而对该人群实行或企图实行屠杀或严重伤害者，则不论在战时或平时，一九四八年十二月九日通过的“防止并惩办集体屠杀罪公约”都肯定地适用。
    我们认为上面所报告的事实，已构成美国的侵略行为及残杀人种行为，也是一个反人类的可憎的罪行。因此，这确实已成为对全世界的一个极端严重的威胁；其范围及其后果实未可预测。
    我们的坚定意见，是以事实为根据的，这些事实我们已本着法学工作之严格性及我们的责任心，而加以证实。
    作为法学者，我们对于此种违反国际法的行动，提出严正的抗议。
    作为民主主义者，我们谴责此种威胁世界和平的侵略行动。
    作为普通的男女，我们对于此种为罪恶的目的，而骇人听闻地利用科学的进步，表示愤懑。
    此报告以法文写成，并由本调查团全体团员于一九五二年四月二日在北京签字。
