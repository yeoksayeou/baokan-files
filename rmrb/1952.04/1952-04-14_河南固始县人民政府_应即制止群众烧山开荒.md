To the Editorial Board:

The practice of some township cadres in Gushi County, Henan Province, leading the masses to burn mountains for land reclamation should be stopped immediately. On March 14th, Zhang Shiguo, the head of the Changjiang River Township in the Eighth District of the county, and Zhang Xiancai, the deputy head of the township, took the lead in setting fire to a mountain with a slope of over 50 degrees. The fire burned for a day and a night, affecting an area of approximately 2,500 mu. Some farmers in this area are still burning mountains for land reclamation, and some are felling trees indiscriminately.

I suggest that the Gushi County People's Government of Henan Province promptly stop this illegal behavior to implement the government's policy of closing hillsides for afforestation and protecting forests.

    河南固始县人民政府
    应即制止群众烧山开荒
    编辑同志：河南固始县某些乡干部，带领群众烧山开荒，这种现象应即制止。该县八区长江河乡乡长张士国、副乡长张贤才等，于三月十四日带头在五十度以上的高山上放火烧山，大火燃烧一天一夜，波及面积约二千五百亩。这一带的农民，有的还在烧山开荒，有的在乱伐林木。
    我建议河南省固始县人民政府迅速制止这种违法行为，以贯彻政府封山护林政策。　何祥怡
