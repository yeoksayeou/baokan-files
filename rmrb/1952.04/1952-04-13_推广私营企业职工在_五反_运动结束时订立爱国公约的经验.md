This issue of our journal introduces the patriotic pacts established or revised by employees of the Shenyang Private Chengfa Iron Factory and the Tianjin Qianxiangyi Chenji Silk and Cloth Shop at the conclusion of the "Five-Anti" campaign. This is a good organizational form for employees of private enterprises to consolidate the achievements of the "Five-Anti" struggle and unite with capitalists to operate legitimate businesses. We believe that employees of all private enterprises throughout the country can establish such patriotic pacts at the conclusion of the "Five-Anti" campaign (those who originally had patriotic pacts should supplement and revise them).

In the vigorous "Five-Anti" campaign, employees of private enterprises and the bourgeoisie throughout the country conducted an irreconcilable struggle against behaviors that violated the Common Program, prompting most illegal business owners to confess their illegal activities, thereby obtaining lenient treatment from the People's Government; and enabling those few illegal capitalists with serious crimes who refused to confess to be punished by law. During the movement, the class consciousness of private enterprise employees was unprecedentedly raised, ideological boundaries were drawn with the bourgeoisie, and organization and unity were strengthened. These have already given the national private industry and commerce a bath and paved the way for future advancement along the path of the New Democratic economy.

In this new situation, employees of private enterprises throughout the country bear two responsibilities: on the one hand, to unite and promote capitalists to operate and develop legitimate businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, to achieve the goal of "developing production and prospering the economy"; on the other hand, to prevent the "relapse" of capitalists and prevent them from doing illegal things again. The realization of these two tasks requires long-term efforts. It is an effective way for employees of private enterprises to establish or revise patriotic pacts around these two tasks and implement them conscientiously, to continue to consolidate their class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm, and to implement the spirit of the "Five-Anti" struggle into future daily struggles.

When establishing and revising patriotic pacts, employees of each enterprise and each unit must fully deliberate and discuss, find improvement methods based on the main problems found in the "Five-Anti" campaign, and set specific and feasible goals to ensure that the patriotic pact can be realized. At the same time, each contracting unit must elect leaders and establish a system of regular and periodic inspections to avoid formalism.

We believe that workers and shop assistants across the country were able to achieve brilliant victories in the "Five-Anti" struggle, and they will surely achieve greater victories in uniting and promoting capitalists to operate legitimate businesses in the future. Let us all conscientiously establish patriotic pacts and move forward more heroically to increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea and to promote the economic construction of the motherland!

    推广私营企业职工在“五反”运动
    结束时订立爱国公约的经验
    本刊这期介绍了沈阳私营成发铁工厂职工和天津谦祥益辰记绸布庄职工在“五反”运动结束时所订立或修订的爱国公约。这是私营企业职工巩固“五反”斗争成果、团结资方经营正当业务的一种良好的组织形式。我们认为：全国各地所有私营企业的职工，在“五反”运动结束时，都可以订立这样的爱国公约（原来订有爱国公约的，则应补充修订）。
    在轰轰烈烈的“五反”运动中，全国各地私营企业的职工和资产阶级的违反共同纲领的行为进行了不调和的斗争，推动大部分违法工商业者坦白了自己的违法行为，因而使他们获得了人民政府的宽大处理；并使那些罪行重大和拒不坦白的少数违法资本家受到了法纪的制裁。在运动中，私营企业职工的阶级觉悟空前提高，和资产阶级划清了思想界限，加强了组织和团结。这些，已经给全国的私营工商业洗了一次澡，为今后循着新民主主义经济轨道前进铺平了道路。
    在这种新的情况下，全国的私营企业职工负有两方面的责任：一方面，是团结和推动资方经营和发展正当的、于国计民生有利的业务，以达到“发展生产、繁荣经济”的目的；另方面，是要防止资本家的“旧病复发”，使他们不要再做违法的事。这两个任务的实现，都要经过长期的努力。私营企业的职工围绕着这两个任务订立或修订爱国公约，并加以切实执行，正是继续巩固自己的阶级觉悟和爱国热情、把“五反”斗争的精神贯彻到今后日常斗争中去的一种有效办法。
    在订立和修订爱国公约时，每个企业、每个单位的职工，都要充分进行酝酿讨论，根据“五反”运动中所发现的主要问题找出改进办法，订出具体可行的目标，务使爱国公约能够实现。同时每个订约单位都要选出领导人，建立经常检查与按期检查的制度，避免产生形式主义的毛病。
    我们相信，全国的工人、店员在“五反”斗争中能够取得辉煌的胜利，今后在团结和推动资方经营正当业务中，一定能取得更大的胜利。大家认真订好爱国公约，为增加抗美援朝的力量，为推进祖国的经济建设更英勇地前进吧！
