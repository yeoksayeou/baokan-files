    Why is the Prisoner of War Issue in Korean Negotiations Protracted?
    The fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks, concerning the arrangement of prisoners of war on both sides, has been under discussion since December 11th of last year, and no agreement has been reached after more than four months. The reason for this is now completely clear.
    During the administrative meetings of the past month, the American aggressors not only showed no sincerity in reaching an early agreement on the armistice talks, but also used the confidentiality of the meeting to cover up their criminal activities of forcibly detaining our captured personnel and painstakingly obstructed the progress of the meeting. During the administrative meetings, the American aggressors deliberately spread optimistic sentiments about the discussion of the POW issue and illegally and unilaterally disclosed the content of the administrative meetings to the American news agencies, attempting to carry out deceptive propaganda for their absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation." At the same time, they shamelessly tampered with our list of captured personnel, attempting to forcibly detain 100,000 of our captured personnel under the guise of the so-called "new list" and "compromise plan." This sinister conspiracy of the American aggressors actually completely overturned the basis of the administrative meetings. This is, of course, absolutely unacceptable to us. For the sake of the armistice, we have repeatedly asked the US side at the meeting to reconsider its position. However, the US side stubbornly insisted on its unreasonable and absurd proposition, which led the meeting into a deadlock. Therefore, at the staff meeting on April 25th, we announced the end of the administrative meeting format and resumed public negotiations. After we announced the resumption of public negotiations, the US side first requested an indefinite adjournment, then proposed convening a delegation meeting, then notified a postponement, and finally wanted to resume the delegation meeting and immediately requested to hold another administrative meeting. Going back on their word, full of contradictions, this further exposed the absurd proposition of disguised "voluntary repatriation" insisted upon by the American aggressors in the administrative meetings, which is unspeakable and untenable. This fully exposed the criminal face of the American aggressors' deliberate forcible detention of our captured personnel and intentional delay of negotiations.
    The so-called "voluntary repatriation" trick played by the American aggressors at the negotiating table is aimed at covering up its bloody inside story. But this bloody inside story has now been thoroughly exposed. The American aggressors have long used the Kuomintang remnants and the agents of the Li Seung-man bandit gang to carry out various criminal activities in the POW camps in Geoje Island and elsewhere, tattooing our captured personnel, forcing them to write blood letters, and forcibly implementing fascist education, attempting to achieve their criminal goal of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. After these despicable means failed, the American aggressors barbarously and massively massacred our captured personnel. In the two collective massacre cases that occurred on Geoje Island on February 18th and March 13th this year, more than 250 of our captured personnel were killed or injured. Recently, the US side openly moved and dispersed the POW camps, more strictly isolating our captured personnel, and continuing to forcibly carry out criminal activities such as "screening" and "reclassification," attempting to destroy the indomitable will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation to their motherland and realize their vicious conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel under the name of "voluntary repatriation." The US side has repeatedly stated in the negotiation meetings that it "strictly abides by" the Geneva Convention. However, the criminal activities of the US side in attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel openly violated the Geneva Convention, so that the US representatives could no longer justify themselves.
    In the discussion of the fourth item on the agenda, we have consistently expressed our infinite sympathy and concern for the prisoners of war on both sides and their families, and have consistently strived for the principle of full release and repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides in accordance with international conventions and humanitarian principles. In the articles of the armistice agreement we have proposed, it has been clearly stipulated that both sides should ensure that prisoners of war are restored to peaceful life after being repatriated. Our initial acceptance of the US request to hold administrative meetings was to ensure that the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, which the US had been obstructing, could be resolved smoothly in accordance with the prisoners' urgent desire to return to their hometowns and live peaceful lives. At the administrative meetings, we reasonably and justly advocated that after the cessation of active hostile acts, the warring parties should promptly release and repatriate all captured personnel they have taken in; at the same time, in order to take into account the urgent desire of the prisoners of war on both sides to return to their hometowns to reunite with their families and to live peaceful lives, we also reasonably and justly advocated that the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army whose original籍(ji) is in southern Korea and the captured personnel of the Li Seung-man puppet army whose original 籍 is in northern Korea may not be repatriated if they wish to stay in their respective hometowns to live peaceful lives. As for the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the United Nations Forces, as well as the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army whose original 籍 is North Korea and the captured personnel of the Li Seung-man puppet army whose original 籍 is South Korea, all must be repatriated to ensure that they can return to their hometowns and restore peaceful lives. Our fair and reasonable propositions and lenient policies on the issue of releasing and repatriating prisoners of war not only fully comply with the principles of the Geneva Convention, but also fully comply with the spirit of humanitarianism and the wishes of the people of the world and the families of the prisoners of war. In order to expose the conspiracy of the American aggressors to use despicable means such as tattooing and writing blood letters to try to force our captured personnel not to express their desire to return to their motherland, the spokesmen of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers recently issued statements under orders, clearly pointing out that we are well aware that during their detention, some of our captured personnel had tattoos on their arms, or wrote certain documents, or performed other similar acts; these acts were by no means voluntary on their part and should not be held responsible by them. We fully welcome all our captured personnel to return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Our open and aboveboard attitude and solemn and reasonable propositions are very clear, while the US side's capricious and unreasonable attitude and absurd propositions are intolerable. Therefore, the US side must abandon its criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel and conduct discussions on the basis of the fair and reasonable propositions we have put forward, and only then can the fourth item on the agenda have the possibility of reaching a complete agreement; otherwise, the result can only be the opposite.

### 朝鲜谈判中的俘虏问题为什么拖延不决？

    朝鲜谈判中的俘虏问题为什么拖延不决？
    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程关于双方俘虏安排的问题，自去年十二月十一日开始讨论以来，迄今四个多月仍未取得协议，其原因何在，现在完全水落石出了。
    在过去一个月的行政性会议中，美国侵略者不仅丝毫没有使停战谈判早日达成协议的诚意表示，而且还利用了这个会议的机密性，掩盖其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶勾当，处心积虑地阻挠会议的进展。在行政性会议期间，美国侵略者曾故意散布对战俘问题讨论的乐观空气，非法地片面地把行政性会议的内容向美国通讯社透露，妄图为他们的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张进行欺骗宣传。同时，又无耻地擅自删改我方被俘人员名单，以所谓“新名单”和“折衷方案”为外衣，企图强迫扣留我方十万名被俘人员。美国侵略者这种险恶的阴谋，实际上完全推翻了行政性会议的基础。这当然是我方所绝对不能考虑的。为了停战的利益，我方在会议上曾一再要美方重新考虑其立场。但美方死硬地坚持其横蛮无理的荒谬主张，使会议陷于僵局。因此，我方在四月二十五日的参谋会议上，宣布结束行政性会议形式，恢复公开谈判。而在我方宣布恢复公开谈判后，美方始则要求无限期休会，继则主张召开代表团大会，后来又通知缓期召开；最后则又要恢复召开代表团大会，并即席要求再开行政性会议。出尔反尔，矛盾百出，这更充分地暴露出美国侵略者在行政性会议中所坚持的变相的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，是见不得人和站不住脚的。这充分地暴露了美国侵略者蓄意强迫扣留我方被俘人员、有意拖延谈判的罪恶面目。
    美国侵略者在谈判桌上所玩弄的所谓“自愿遣返”的把戏，其目的在于掩盖它的血腥的内幕。但是这个血腥的内幕现在已经彻底被揭穿了。美国侵略者早就利用国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮的特务，在巨济岛等地俘虏营中进行各种罪恶活动，在我方被俘人员身上刺字，强迫他们写血书，强制实行法西斯教育，妄图达到其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶目的。当这些卑鄙手段失败之后，美国侵略者就野蛮地大规模屠杀我方被俘人员。今年二月十八日和三月十三日在巨济岛发生的两次集体屠杀案中，我方被俘人员死伤者就有二百五十余人；最近美方又公开将战俘营迁移分散，更加严密地隔绝我方被俘人员，继续强迫进行“甄别”、“重新分类”等罪恶活动，企图摧毁我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的不可屈服的意志，实现其在“自愿遣返”名义下强迫扣留我方被俘人员的恶毒阴谋。美方在谈判会议中一再声言“严格遵守”日内瓦公约，然而，美方企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶活动，却公开破坏了日内瓦公约，以致美方代表再也无法自圆其说了。
    在第四项议程的讨论中，我方一贯表示了对于双方被俘人员和他们家属的无限同情和关怀，一贯为合乎国际公约和人道原则的全部释放并遣返双方被俘人员的原则而努力。在我方所提出的停战协定的条文中，并曾明确地规定双方应保证战俘被遣返后，恢复和平生活。我方当初接受美方关于举行行政性会议的要求，就是为了使美方所一直阻挠的遣返战俘问题能够顺利解决，以符合战俘对于回返家乡，过和平生活的迫切愿望。在行政性会议上，我方合情合理地主张在积极的敌对行为停止后，交战双方应迅速地释放并遣返各自收容的全部被俘人员；同时，为了照顾双方被俘人员迫切返回其故乡与家人团聚和重度和平生活的意愿，我方并合理地主张原籍朝鲜南部的朝鲜人民军和原籍朝鲜北部的李承晚伪军的被俘人员，如果愿意留在他们各自的家乡过和平生活，可以不予遣返。至于中国人民志愿军和联合国军被俘人员以及朝鲜人民军被俘人员之原籍北朝鲜者和李承晚伪军被俘人员之原籍南朝鲜者，均必须全部遣返，以保证他们能够返回家乡，恢复和平生活。我方在释放并遣返战俘问题上的这些公平合理的主张和宽待俘虏的政策，不仅完全符合日内瓦公约的原则，而且是完全符合人道主义的精神和世界人民以及被俘人员家属的愿望的。为了揭穿美国侵略者用刺字、写血书之类的卑鄙手段，企图迫使我方被俘人员不敢再表示他们要求返回祖国的愿望的阴谋，朝鲜人民军最高司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部发言人最近奉命发表的声明，又明确地指出：我方深知我方被俘人员在拘留期间，曾有一部分人在臂上刺字，或写下某种文件，或作其他类似的行为；这些行为绝非出于他们的自愿，不应由他们负责。我们完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国的怀抱。
    我方光明磊落的态度和严正合理的主张是非常明白的，而美方出尔反尔的蛮横态度和荒谬无理的主张则是令人不能容忍的。因此，美方必须放弃强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶阴谋，在我方所提出的公平合理的主张的基础上进行讨论，第四项议程才有取得完全协议的可能；否则，结果就只能是相反的。
