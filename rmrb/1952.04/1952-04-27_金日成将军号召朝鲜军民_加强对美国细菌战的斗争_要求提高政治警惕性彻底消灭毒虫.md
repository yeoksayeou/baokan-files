Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 26th: General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Military Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued an order on the 22nd regarding "Countermeasures to Further Strengthen the Struggle Against the Enemy's Bacteriological Warfare." The order states: The enemy continues to use bacteriological weapons more ferociously in our vast areas. The types of vermin spread include 34 kinds such as flies, fleas, mosquitoes, cattle lice, lice, bed bugs, spiders, ants, and crickets. These insects carry various malignant infectious disease bacteria such as bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid fever, and bacillary dysentery. Especially recently, the enemy has not only spread germ-carrying vermin but also various germ-carrying poisons. As summer approaches, the risk of malignant infectious diseases caused by the widespread spreading of bacteria by the enemy increases.

In order to thoroughly crush the enemy's continued bacteriological warfare atrocities, General Kim Il-sung's order calls on all military personnel and civilians to heighten their political vigilance, strictly implement the Military Commission's instructions of February 20th regarding "Countermeasures to Combat the Enemy's Bacteriological Warfare" and the order of February 29th regarding "Countermeasures to Combat the Enemy's Bacteriological Warfare," and thoroughly eliminate vermin. The order also calls on responsible persons of all levels of government organs, political parties, and social organizations to take the lead in strictly implementing the above-mentioned instructions and orders.

The order instructs the Chairman of the State Special Epidemic Prevention Committee to strictly guide and inspect the implementation of the epidemic prevention committee's epidemic prevention measures.

The order instructs the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Director of the State Health Inspection Institute to strictly inspect the implementation of the Military Commission's instructions and orders at any time, and instructs the Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the directors of the procuratorial bureaus of the armed forces to conscientiously supervise within their respective work scopes and report the overall situation directly to General Kim Il-sung.
