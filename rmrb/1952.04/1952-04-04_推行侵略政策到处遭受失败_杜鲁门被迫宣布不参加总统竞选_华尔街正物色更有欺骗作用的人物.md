Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Washington dispatch: Due to the failure of pursuing aggressive policies abroad and growing unpopularity at home, U.S. President Truman formally announced on March 29th that he would not participate in the next presidential election.

Truman's seven years in office have been marked by a series of political, economic, and military acts of aggression: the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Korean War. These have brought severe disasters to the United States. Domestically, he has overseen military expansion, high prices, increased taxes, "loyalty investigations," anti-labor legislation, judicial persecution of communists and progressives, and a "national emergency," adding heavy burdens to the people. Precisely because of this, even American bourgeois opinion polls show that in recent years, especially after the United States suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, Truman's prestige—or, more precisely, his deceptive role—has plummeted. Within the Democratic Party, open disagreements have long existed regarding whether Truman is suitable to be a candidate for the next presidential election. Many important Democratic figures have stated that they will firmly oppose nominating Truman as a candidate. Even prominent Southern Democrats, such as Senator Russell, who avoided opposing Truman in the 1948 election, have indicated their intention to undermine Truman.

As early as January, the "Wall Street Journal" stated, "Most Democrats believe that Truman is the weakest candidate they can elect at the national convention." The February 15th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" even began planning for Truman's life after leaving office. In an article titled "Truman Made a Fortune," the magazine said, "If Truman retires, he doesn't have to worry about money. By the end of his presidential term, by all standards, he will be a wealthy man. … Truman, who was almost bankrupt when he took office, will be rolling in wealth when he steps down, with a minimum income of $10,000 a year from now on." Truman's "achievements," filled with failure, have clearly dissatisfied the bosses on Wall Street. They have begun to seek a new, more deceptive agent to reside in the White House.

Lacking confidence in being re-elected but still ambitious, Truman has never clearly stated his intentions in the next election. In the New Hampshire primary in mid-March, Truman secretly campaigned for himself through the Democratic Party machine for fear that another Democrat, Kefauver, would gain power. The result was a humiliating failure. After this miserable experience, Truman immediately withdrew from the presidential candidate primary election scheduled for June in California.

On March 29th, Truman fiercely attacked the Republican Party's criticism of the Truman administration in a speech, defended his failures, and accused the foreign policy advocated by the Republicans as equally "wrong." But in the same speech, apparently because he had completely lost confidence in being re-elected as president, Truman sadly announced, "I don't have the responsibility to spend another four years in the White House." According to American news agencies, Truman's decision to finally announce that he would not participate in the election was made after careful consideration. Therefore, this is undoubtedly a powerful confession of the bankruptcy of the U.S. government's post-war expansion and armament policy.

    推行侵略政策到处遭受失败
    杜鲁门被迫宣布不参加总统竞选
    华尔街正物色更有欺骗作用的人物
    【新华社三日讯】华盛顿消息：由于在国外推行侵略政策到处遭受失败以及在国内日益不得人心，美国总统杜鲁门在三月二十九日正式宣布不参加下届总统竞选。
    杜鲁门执政七年的政绩，在对外方面就是杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约以及朝鲜战争这一连串政治、经济、军事的侵略行动，给美国带来严重的灾难；在内政方面，就是军备扩张、物价高涨、捐税增加、“忠诚调查”、反劳工立法、对共产党和进步人士的司法迫害以及“全国紧急状态”，给人民增加重重压迫。正是因为这样，所以连美国资产阶级的民意测验也显示：近年来，特别是在美国在朝鲜遭到惨败之后，杜鲁门的威信——更确切地说是他的欺骗作用——已一落千丈。在民主党内，关于杜鲁门是否合乎担任下届总统候选人早已发生公开的分歧。许多民主党重要人物表示他们将坚决反对提名杜鲁门为候选人。甚至在一九四八年选举时避免反对杜鲁门的南方民主党人重要领袖、参议员鲁塞尔等人也表示要拆杜鲁门的台。
    早在今年一月，“华尔街日报”就说：“大部分民主党人认为杜鲁门是他们在全国代表大会中所能选出的最弱的候选人。”二月十五日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”甚至已替杜鲁门盘算了下台后的生活。在题为“杜鲁门搞了一笔家私”的一篇文章中，该杂志说：“如果杜鲁门退休的话，他不用愁没有钱。到本届总统任期期满时，从各种标准来看，他都是个富翁了。……上任时差不多是破产了的杜鲁门，下台时将腰缠累累，今后每年至少可有一万美元的收入。”杜鲁门的充满失败的“政绩”显然已使华尔街的老板们不满。他们开始物色他们驻白宫的新的更有欺骗作用的代理人了。
    由于缺乏重新当选的把握而又野心未死，杜鲁门一直未明白表示他在下届选举中的意图。在三月中旬的新罕布什尔州预选中，杜鲁门因恐怕另一民主党人克福沃得势，暗中通过民主党的党机器为他竞选。结果是威信扫地的失败。有了这次可悲的经验，杜鲁门随即退出了定于六月举行的加利福尼亚州的总统候选人预选。
    三月二十九日，杜鲁门在一次演说中猛烈反击共和党对杜鲁门政府的抨击，为自己的失败辩护，斥责共和党人所主张的外交政策同样是“错误的”。但是就在同一个演说里，显然由于对自己的重新当选为总统已完全失去信心，杜鲁门悲哀地宣布：“我没有责任再在白宫过四年了。”据美国通讯社透露，杜鲁门终于不得不宣布不参加竞选的这一决定，是经过仔细权衡的。因此，这无疑是美国政府战后扩张和军备政策破产的有力招供。
