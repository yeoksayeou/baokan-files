    All Prisoners of War Must Be Repatriated
    On April 6th, the spokesperson of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers issued an important statement on the issue of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the Korean armistice. This statement reiterated our consistent and reasonable position on the POW issue: Once active hostilities between the warring parties in Korea cease, both sides should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by them. Our captured personnel, under the enemy's policy of openly violating the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war and cruelly persecuting and massacring POWs, were forced to tattoo reactionary slogans on their bodies or write reactionary pledges in blood. The spokesperson stated clearly that these actions were not voluntary and they cannot be held responsible for them, and welcomed all of them back to participate in peaceful construction and live peaceful lives. This statement is a solemn expression of our firm stance on the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war; it is a solemn warning to the American aggressors' conspiracy to detain our captured personnel.
    From the reports of American news agencies published by Xinhua News Agency and the confessions of American captured paratrooper spy Li Xingshun and others, everyone knows that the United States government, in an attempt to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to the prisoner of war camps to subject our captured volunteers to all kinds of insults, persecution, and torture. The United States government, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, which it personally participated in, regarding the protection of prisoners from maltreatment, insults, threats, and bodily harm, not only used the primitive methods of tattooing and writing pledges in blood, unique to the United States, to abuse and insult the prisoners under its direct jurisdiction, but also subjected those who refused to accept such insults to beatings, shootings, denial of food, and secret executions, and other extremely brutal and illegal punishments used by murderers, to force them to submit; moreover, after a few captured persons were forced to accept such insults, the American aggressors further threatened them, saying that they would "only face death" if they returned to our side, in an attempt to prevent them from still demanding to return to our side.
    While the United States government was carrying out these illegal activities in the prisoner of war camps, it was raising the banner of so-called respect for the "free will" of prisoners of war in the armistice negotiations, advocating so-called "voluntary repatriation" for the purpose of undermining the Geneva Convention, hoping to disguise its murderous and brutal acts and its blatant violation of international conventions as a legitimate, but in fact illegal, "principle" for sale, and to realize its deliberate detention of captured volunteers and handing them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits under this so-called "principle."
    The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate the American aggressors' illegal and brutal crimes against our captured personnel. We fully support the solemn statement of the spokesperson of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war. All our captured personnel must be repatriated so that they can resume their peaceful lives. Our struggle will not cease until this goal is achieved.

Our Side Reiterates Firm Stance on Neutral Nations' Nomination and Airfield Issue

    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th] On the 10th, in the subcommittee on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, our representative pointed out: "It has been a week since the subcommittee reconvened. Your side should have a full understanding of our side's position on the remaining issues of the third agenda item and our side's reasonable solutions. On the issue of neutral nations' nomination, our side has proposed countries that fully meet the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides. Your side's opposition to our side's nomination of neutral nations is completely unreasonable. As for the unreasonable demand to restrict airfield facilities in Korea, our chief representative pointed out as early as last November, when your side first raised this unreasonable demand at the plenary session on the third agenda item, that any such unreasonable demand interfering in our internal affairs is absolutely unacceptable to us, and is something we will absolutely never accept. Regardless of the form of the meeting, whether in plenary sessions, subcommittees, or staff meetings, our side's position will not change. In order for the meeting to make progress, your side must abandon this unreasonable demand. If your side is willing to reconvene the staff meetings, our side can agree. If your side has no new opinions, I suggest adjourning the meeting until the usual time tomorrow." The other side did not say a word. The meeting made no progress.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th] On the 9th, in the subcommittee on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, our representative pointed out: Before the subcommittee delegated the specific details of the third agenda item to the staff of both sides for consultation and resolution on January 27th, our side had fully explained our firm opposition to the unreasonable demand to restrict airfield facilities in Korea. However, the other side reiterated this demand interfering in our internal affairs at the staff meetings and refused to withdraw this unreasonable demand. Therefore, our side proposed convening the subcommittee to resolve the issue of restricting airfield facilities together with the issue of neutral nations' nomination. The other side still had no new proposals at the subcommittee meeting on the 9th, and the meeting made no progress.

### 必须遣返全部战俘

    必须遣返全部战俘
    本月六日朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人奉命对朝鲜停战后释放并遣返全部战俘问题发表了一个重要声明。这个声明重申我方对遣俘问题一贯的合理主张：一俟在朝鲜的交战双方的积极敌对行为终止后，双方应迅速释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘。我方被俘人员在敌方公然破坏日内瓦战俘公约，对战俘进行残酷迫害与屠杀的政策之下，曾被迫在身上刺下反动字样或被迫写下反动血书。发言人声明对这一点明确指出，这些行为并非出于战俘自愿，不能由他们负责，并表示欢迎他们全体回来参加和平建设事业，并过和平生活。这个声明是我方对释放并遣返全部战俘的坚决主张的严正表示；它是对美国侵略者企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋的庄严警告。
    从新华社历次所发表的美国自己的通讯社的报道和美方被俘空降特务李兴顺等的口供中，人人知道，美国政府为了企图扣留我方被俘人员送交蒋介石匪帮，曾经遣派大批蒋匪帮特务分子到俘虏营中，对我志愿军被俘人员进行百般的侮辱、迫害和虐杀。美国政府不顾它所亲自参加的日内瓦战俘公约关于保护俘虏不受虐待、侮辱、威胁和毁伤身体的规定，对于在它直接管辖下的战俘，不仅用美国所特有的文身刺字的原始办法和写血书等，来虐待和侮辱他们，并且，对拒绝接受这种侮辱的人员施以毒打、枪杀、不许进食和秘密处死等等谋杀犯所使用的极端暴虐、极端非法的处分，来强逼他们就范；而且在少数被俘者被逼接受了这种侮辱之后，美国侵略者们又进一步威胁他们，说他们回到我方“只有死路一条”，企图以此来防止他们仍然要求回到我方。
    美国政府一方面在俘虏营干着这种犯法勾当，另一方面却又在停战谈判中打起所谓尊重战俘“自由意志”的招牌，主张以破坏日内瓦公约为目的的什么“自愿遣返”，希图把他们谋杀犯的暴虐的勾当和公然破坏国际公约的行为，装成是合法的、但实际上是犯法的“原则” 来出售，并在这个所谓“原则”之下，来实现其蓄意扣留志愿军被俘人员，并把他们送交蒋介石匪类的主张。
    中国人民绝对不能容忍美国侵略者对待我被俘人员这种非法的暴虐的罪行。我们完全支持朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人关于遣返全部战俘的严正声明。我方被俘人员必须全部遣返，好让他们恢复和平生活，如达不到这个目的，我们的斗争决不休止。关于中立国提名和机场问题我方重申坚定立场
    【新华社开城十日电】十日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出：“小组委员会复会以来，已经有一星期之久。我方对于第三项议程的剩余问题的立场和我方的合理解决方案，你方应该已有充分的了解。在中立国提名问题上，我方提出了完全合乎双方协议的中立国定义的国家。你方反对我方的中立国提名是完全没有道理的。至于所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求，早在去年十一月你方第一次在第三项议程大会上提出这一无理要求的时候，我方首席代表就已经指出任何这种干涉我方内政的无理要求，都是我方所绝对不能考虑的，更是我方所绝对不会接受的。不论会议的形式有何改变，不论在大会上，小组委员会上，或是在参谋会议上，我方的这一立场将不会有任何的更改。为了会议得以有所进展，你方必须放弃这一无理要求。如果你方愿意重新召开参谋会议，我方可以同意。如果你方没有新的意见，我建议休会到明天通常时间。”对方未发一言。会议无进展。
    【新华社开城九日电】九日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出：在一月二十七日小组委员会将第三项议程的具体细节问题交由双方参谋人员协商解决以前，我方就已经充分地说明了我方坚决反对所谓限制朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求。但对方在参谋会议上却再次提出这一干涉我方内政的要求，并拒绝撤消这一无理要求。因此我方提议召开小组委员会，将这所谓限制机场设备的问题与中立国提名问题一并解决。对方在九日小组会上仍无任何新建议，会议无进展。
