    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, which includes reinforcing the Jingjiang Dike, fully commenced on April 5th. On the 133-kilometer-long Jingjiang Dike and the hundreds of kilometers of the flood diversion area construction sites, over 200,000 military personnel, workers, and civilians have launched a heated labor competition. Tang Tianji, Xu Ziwei, Yuan Zhen, and other responsible leaders of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters are inspecting the commencement of work at the construction site. On the 5th, a grand commencement ceremony was held at the construction site, where all staff and the vast numbers of military personnel, workers, and civilians swore an oath to Chairman Mao, pledging to overcome all difficulties and complete the task on schedule.

    Huang Guanggen, Liu Shichang, and Yao Changsheng, production models and a bandit-suppression hero from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the Huangshantou Sluice Gate project, have challenged all combat heroes and model commanders and fighters of the unit to strive for even greater achievements in this great project. Yu Ziliang's civilian worker team, which had previously participated in the Huai River harnessing project, formulated a patriotic covenant and a merit-making plan before starting work. A patriotic labor competition is unfolding enthusiastically at the construction site. Huang Guanggen, who initiated the labor competition, carried 2.5 cubic meters of soil in four hours. The average soldier in the unit carries approximately 3 cubic meters of soil in six hours.

    Currently, command headquarters at all levels leading the construction have been established. Dike and sluice gate works for the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and flood diversion project have commenced. Various materials required for the repair work are being transported in a continuous stream. All personnel are determined to successfully complete this arduous task before the flood season.

    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has fully commenced, and the 230,000 residents who need to be relocated from the flood diversion area have been properly relocated and resettled.

    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area includes parts of Jiangling, Gong'an, and Shishou counties in Hubei Province, located between the Jingjiang, Hudu River, and Anxiang River, covering an area of over 920 square kilometers. This area is low-lying and prone to flooding in the past, with a saying that there is "a collapse every year, a minor flood every three years, and a major flood every five years." As a flood diversion area, it can be used to divert and store excess water during the peak of the Jingjiang River, and then gradually release the stored water back into the Jingjiang River when the water recedes. The residents of the flood diversion area, who have suffered greatly from floods in the past, understand the great significance of their relocation to the millions of people in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, under the slogan of "Relocate residents from one place for the peace of thousands of miles," they had already begun organized relocation. The People's Government has allocated land to them in their new residences and provided them with huge sums of money, worth billions, to help them solve difficulties in settling down, transportation, and land reclamation. During the relocation, the People's Government organized them into relocation teams and mutual aid groups to collectively transport furniture and help each other build new houses. Farmers who moved far away to Jiangbei in Shishou County, more than a hundred miles away, launched a "settle down early, start production early" competition to catch up with this spring's land reclamation and production. They worked from dawn till dusk, sometimes fighting against strong winds and heavy snow, and finally completed the two major tasks of settling down and distributing land before the Qingming Festival.

    In the process of relocation and settlement, residents of the flood diversion area received manpower and material support from the people in the nearby areas south and north of the Yangtze River. Cart teams, wheelbarrows from the Shashi Transportation Station, ox-drawn carts from the villages, and nearby civilian boats all came from all directions to help them transport their belongings back and forth. As early as the beginning of this year, thousands of migrant workers had transported a large number of building materials such as bamboo, wood, and straw prepared by the People's Government for the migrants to the resettlement area. Now, tractors from state-owned farms in Hubei Province are galloping in the fields of the reclamation area, reclaiming the fertile virgin land north of the Jingjiang River for them. Some immigrants have already sown seeds in their new land. (Xinhua News Agency)

    荆江分洪工程已经全面动工
    分洪区内二十三万居民已妥善迁移安插
    长江中游的荆江大堤加固荆江分洪工程，已在四月五日全面动工。在一百三十三公里长的荆江大堤和数百公里的分洪区工地上，二十多万军工、民工已展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。荆江分洪工程总指挥部的唐天际、许子威和袁振等负责首长都在工地检查开工情况。五日，工地上举行隆重的开工典礼，全体工作人员和广大军工、民工都向毛主席宣誓，保证克服一切困难，按期完成任务。
    参加黄山头节制闸工程的人民解放军某部生产模范黄广根、刘时常和剿匪英雄姚常生等，已向该部全体功臣和模范指战员发起挑战，争取在伟大工程中功上加功。曾参加过治淮工程的于子良民工小队在上工前就订好了爱国公约和立功计划。工地上爱国主义劳动竞赛正在热火朝天地展开。发起劳动竞赛的黄广根在四小时内就挑了二点五公方土。该部一般的战士，平均每人在六小时内挑土约三公方。
    现在，领导施工的各级指挥部都已成立，荆江大堤加固和分洪工程的堤工、闸工都已动工，修工所需的各项器材源源运到，全体人员决心在汛前胜利完成这一艰巨的任务。（新华社）
    长江中游的荆江分洪工程已全面开工，分洪区内须迁移的二十三万居民，已妥善迁移、安插。
    荆江分洪区包括湖北省江陵、公安、石首三县各一部，在荆江、虎渡河、安乡河之间，面积约九百二十多平方公里。这块地方地势低洼，过去常遭洪水淹没，有“一年一溃水，三年一小水，五年一大水”之说。作为分洪区后，在荆江暴涨时即可用以分蓄过多的水，荆江水退时再将所蓄的水逐渐放归荆江。分洪区内的居民，过去饱受洪水的灾害，他们明白自己搬家对长江中游千百万人民的重大意义，因此，在“一地移民千里安”的口号下，他们早就开始有组织地迁移。人民政府给他们在新的住处分配了土地，又拿出百亿巨款帮助他们解决安家、运输和开荒等方面的困难。搬家时，人民政府把他们组成了搬家队和互助组，集体搬运家具和互助修盖新房。远移到百里以外石首县江北的农民，为着赶上今春开荒生产，并相互展开了“早安家、早生产”的竞赛。他们每天起早摸黑地工作，有时并和大风大雪搏斗，终于在清明节前，突击完成了安家分田两大任务。
    分洪区的居民在搬家、安家过程中，受到江南、江北附近人民的人力、物力上的支援。沙市搬运站的板车队、独轮车和村庄上的牛拖子，以及附近的民船，都从四面八方来帮助他们往返运输东西。成千上万的民工，早在今年年初，就把人民政府为移民准备的大批竹、木、稻草等建筑器材送到了移民区。现在，来自湖北省各国营农场的拖拉机，正驰骋在垦殖区的田野上，为他们开垦荆江以北的肥沃的处女地。有的移民已在新的土地上播种了。（新华社）
