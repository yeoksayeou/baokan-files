The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, since entering Xinjiang in 1950, has been diligently engaged in the production and construction of the frontier of the motherland in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on the army participating in production. Their hard work over the past two years has demonstrated that the People's Liberation Army is a great force for building the frontier of the motherland. In 1951 alone, they created wealth equivalent to one trillion yuan for the country. They played a role in promoting, leading, and demonstrating the construction of the frontier of the motherland and inspiring people of all ethnic groups to actively engage in construction.

The Superiority of Collective Agricultural Labor

In 1950, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang cultivated a total of one million mu of land, harvesting 70 million jin of grain, more than 753,000 jin of ginned cotton, more than 3,221,000 jin of oilseeds, and more than 45 million jin of melons and vegetables. In 1951, they planted more than 980,000 mu of land, harvesting more than 89 million jin of grain, more than 1.1 million jin of ginned cotton, more than 3.9 million jin of oilseeds, and more than 180 million jin of melons, vegetables, and alfalfa. That is to say, in 1951, the cultivated land was reduced by 20,000 mu compared with 1950, while the grain increased by 27 percent, ginned cotton increased by 46 percent, oilseeds increased by 21 percent, and melons and vegetables increased even more.

These figures cannot fully explain the entire facts of the abundant harvest on the agricultural production front in 1951. Because: First, in 1951, a large part of the troops participated in water conservancy and factory and barracks construction projects, and the number of people participating in agricultural production was reduced compared with 1950. Second, in the agricultural production of 1951, some troops were affected by the bureaucratic work style of commanders and did not get a good harvest; there were also some that were sown but had no harvest at all. But judging from the overall production results, the yield per unit area of various crops has been significantly improved; and very high yields per unit area have appeared on large areas of tens of mu or more than one hundred mu. For example, the highest yield of wheat per mu reached 800 jin, rice reached 1,308 jin, corn reached 1,270 jin, ginned cotton reached 140 jin, and sugar beet reached 15,000 jin. These achievements show that even in Xinjiang, where the winter is long and the climate changes greatly, various crops can achieve high yields.

The remarkable achievements of the bumper harvest fully demonstrate the superiority of collective labor, and also fully demonstrate the organization, discipline, and high political consciousness of the People's Army. Agricultural production is carried out under the strict planning and leadership of the Xinjiang Military Region Production Committee. Production committees and production cooperatives have been established in military command organs at all levels to specifically lead production work and implement production plans. The agricultural production carried out by various units is a part of the entire plan. They exchange and summarize experiences through production representative meetings, labor model representative meetings, etc., and carry out revolutionary competitions of new heroism. In this way, the various units can specifically and reasonably organize the labor force and give full play to labor efficiency. At the same time, because collective labor is suitable for planting one crop on a large area of land in a concentrated manner, this changes the unreasonable phenomenon of individual farmers planting several crops on a small amount of land. This not only facilitates the management of various crops, saves labor and irrigation water, but also facilitates the adoption of various crop rotation systems to restore the fertility of the land and continuously increase yields.

After the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang spent the difficult period of "everything is difficult at the beginning" in 1950, opened up the labor production front, and obtained the means of subsistence, they used the wealth increased in production and a part of the surplus from expenditures to purchase a large number of new-style animal-drawn farm implements from the Soviet Union. In the agricultural production of 1951, various units widely used animal-drawn farm implements such as walking plows, zigzag harrows, ten-row seeders, and harvesters. At the same time, the commanders and fighters of various units combined their high enthusiasm for labor production with science and technology to create and improve many farm implements. A certain regiment created and improved 25 kinds of farm implements in the past year alone. The efficiency of these farm implements has increased by two to five times compared with the original farm implements. For example, Yang Maolin, the deputy squad leader of a certain company, imitated a six-row seeder; Lu Yuhu, a carpenter from the reconnaissance and communications company, created a five-row seeder, and two people and one horse could sow 40 mu per day. For another example, a certain unit used stone rollers to thresh grain, and threshed 10,000 jin of grain per day; dragging willow branches behind the stone rollers can double the efficiency. New-style animal-drawn farm implements and many improved farm implements can only be widely used under collective labor. The use of these new farm implements has increased the work efficiency of agricultural production in 1951 by more than double compared with the use of hoe for cultivation in 1950, and has achieved the effect of abundant production.

The collective labor of the troops makes it possible to apply all the most advanced science and technology. In the agricultural experiment stations in Yanqi, Dihua, and Shihezi area on the edge of the Manas River, tractors and agricultural machinery have begun to be used for cultivation. Commanders and fighters believe that using agricultural machinery to replace animal-drawn farm implements is no longer a "distant prospect".

The great achievements created by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang on the agricultural production front have had a good impact on the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Uyghur farmers in Shufu County, southern Xinjiang, have learned the advanced farming techniques brought by the People's Liberation Army. In 1951, the yield per unit area of several major food crops such as wheat and corn in Shufu County increased by 19 percent compared with before liberation, and by 8.4 percent compared with 1950. Uyghur farmers in Baicheng County, Aksu Prefecture, used to broadcast seeds before liberation, but after liberation they have learned to use seed drills. Because the seedlings are neat after drilling and weeding is convenient, the yield has also increased. The seeds saved by drilling are equivalent to all the public grain paid by farmers in Baicheng County last year. As Xinjiang farmers accepted advanced farming methods, in 1951, the average yield of various grains per mu in Xinjiang Province reached 170 jin, an increase of 10.4 percent compared with 1950.

From the large-scale production movement of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Xinjiang have realized the superiority of collective labor; they are extremely interested in using new-style animal-drawn farm implements, especially tractors and other agricultural machinery. Now they have organized many mutual aid teams. In 1951, more than 91,000 mutual aid teams were organized in Xinjiang Province, with more than 800,000 farmers of all ethnic groups participating in the mutual aid teams, including more than 290,000 rural women. This kind of mutual aid team will develop more massively and towards more advanced forms after the implementation of land reform in Xinjiang's rural areas. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has erected a bright banner on the frontier of the great motherland, pointing out the direction of collectivization and mechanization of agricultural production to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

A Pioneering Undertaking to Turn the Gobi into an Oasis

Xinjiang is an arid region, and all farmland relies on artificial irrigation; but water resources are abundant. There are many inland rivers, which have tens or more than one hundred cubic meters per second of water flow, all of which seep into the desert and are not utilized. In addition, there are many places where reservoirs can be built to accumulate summer floods. Near each river, there are millions of mu of uncultivated virgin land. Although there is a thin layer of alkali soil on these lands, under the alkali soil is black clay and loam. As long as these virgin lands are hoeed to remove the weeds growing on them and there is enough water to wash away the alkali and irrigate them, they can be reclaimed into fertile farmland.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has attached importance to the construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects from the beginning of production and construction.

In 1950, in order to sow in time, the main focus was on the development of small-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects and the renovation of existing channels. In this year, a total of 80 new and renovated channels were built, with a total length of more than 2 million meters; more than 27,000 meters of dikes were built; two reservoirs were repaired; and a total of more than 2 million cubic meters of earth were excavated and filled. The new and renovated channels can irrigate 1.27 million mu of land.

Starting from the second half of 1950, the troops stationed in Xinjiang began to carry out large-scale modern water conservancy and irrigation project construction. This is a great plan to transform nature: to complete the water conservancy project of irrigating 5 million mu of land within five years (1950 to 1954). The channels that need to be built in this plan include the Heping Canal in Dihua, the Liberation First Canal on the south bank of Yanqi, the Liberation Second Canal on the north bank of Yanqi, the 18th Regiment Canal in Korla, the Red Star Canal in Hami, the Victory Canal in Aksu, and the development of the land in the Manas River and Ili River basins. Among them, Heping Canal, Liberation First Canal, Liberation Second Canal, 18th Regiment Canal, Red Star Canal, and Victory Canal have all started construction in the winter of 1950 and 1951 respectively. In 1951, more than 9.3 million cubic meters of earth were excavated and filled, more than 150,000 cubic meters of stone were laid, and 105 buildings such as drop structures, bridges, flumes, diversion gates, and intake gates were completed.

In 1951, in addition to carrying out these large-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects, more than 190 small-scale channels were newly built and renovated, 2,700 meters of dikes were repaired, 4,000 meters of dams were built, and three reservoirs, bridges, flumes and other buildings were built. These channels can irrigate more than 460,000 mu of land.

The construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects is making it possible to reclaim hundreds of thousands or millions of mu of entire land. The reclamation of large areas of land creates conditions for agricultural collectivization. Later, the troops can concentrate on managing large areas of land, and give the small areas of land originally reclaimed and the water channels that can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land to farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for use; and can give the houses and some farm implements built by the troops to farmers of all ethnic groups to help them establish demonstration collective farms, so as to gradually gain experience in the collectivization of agriculture in Xinjiang.

In terms of afforestation and forest protection, 1.19 million trees were planted in the spring of 1951, an increase of five times compared with 1950. Units above the regimental level are mostly equipped with nurseries to cultivate seedlings themselves, which has prepared favorable conditions for large-scale afforestation in the future.

"Turning the Gobi into an oasis" has been a beautiful ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for many years. Now, under the hard work of the People's Liberation Army, this ideal is gradually becoming a reality in front of people's eyes.

Industrializing Backward Areas

Xinjiang had no industrial base in the past, but extremely rich mineral resources are buried underground in Xinjiang.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang also pays great attention to industrial construction. The development of agricultural production depends on the construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects, and the construction of water conservancy projects requires a large amount of steel and cement; the processing of agricultural products also requires industrial construction. Only by establishing large factories in the border areas can we smoothly develop agricultural production, finally change the economic face of Xinjiang, and make Xinjiang catch up with advanced areas from backward areas.

Industrial construction requires a large amount of investment. They obtained the means of subsistence from agricultural production, saved food expenses and monthly allowances, and accumulated every penny in the form of cooperatives, and used this fund to start fuel, power, iron and steel, cement, machine repair, agricultural product processing and textile, flour, sugar making and other industrial construction.

Industrial construction is proceeding at an extraordinarily rapid speed. The huge textile factory began to be designed in the summer of 1950, and it can be put into production this spring. Iron and steel plants, cement plants, hydropower plants, thermal power plants, and automobile repair plants will all be put into production before this fall. The open-pit coal mine project, which began excavation in July 1951, was completed last winter and is now producing coal; this can timely supply enough fuel needed for the start-up of various factories in 1952. Preparations are now underway to sink vertical shafts for permanent mining. This mining area was originally a desolate loess beach, with uneven pits and depressions all over the ground. According to an expert's estimate, under the current conditions, this project would take at least two years to complete. However, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army only used more than four months to complete the arduous project of digging the hills into deep pits, leveling more than two kilometers of deep trenches, and excavating 183,000 cubic meters of earth. The climate in northern Xinjiang is very cold, and the wind on the plateau carries sand. The mining pit is getting deeper day by day, and the difficulties are also increasing. However, the fighters' high patriotic labor enthusiasm not only overcame the strong winds and heavy snow, but also overcame various difficulties such as frozen ground and slippery roads. They deeply knew the role of digging one more piece of earth and pushing one more cart of earth in building the frontier of the motherland.

In the past two years, the troops participating in factory construction have worked selflessly. Under the harsh climate of minus 37 degrees, the fighters transported thousands of large logs from the mountains more than 200 miles away to the construction area. Some people's hands and feet were frostbitten, but their labor enthusiasm remained high. In the project, commanders, fighters, engineering personnel, and technicians all displayed a high degree of creativity. The output of each brick press in the brick factory increased from 1,300 bricks per day to 3,200 bricks per day. The rate of brick wall construction has exceeded five times the rate at the beginning of construction. The commanders and fighters engaged in engineering construction quickly learned the skills they had not previously possessed. Originally, all the technicians in the reinforced concrete construction project were invited from Guannei; now the personnel participating in the construction project have become skilled workers, and 1,300 of them have been trained as skilled technicians in steel bar tying, concrete pouring, ironworking, carpentry, and painting. In 1951, they completed the construction of more than 110,000 square meters of factories, barracks and other buildings. They are building a new city on a desolate grassland.

Strive for New and Greater Victories

The great achievements of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang in various labor production and construction projects in the past two years are the result of all the commanders and fighters engaging in labor production selflessly under the education of patriotism and internationalism, overcoming the serious difficulties in the first half of 1950 and the idea of some commanders lacking confidence in production, and gradually learning various production technologies. In particular, the heroic and arduous battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all commanders and fighters. They said: "Compared with the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, what is it to work a little harder?" They put forward the fighting slogan of "Consolidating the frontier of the motherland and accelerating the economic construction of the frontier of the motherland is the practical action to support the resistance against America and aid Korea." This slogan has played a huge role in various production and construction work.

The leaders of the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang adopted the leadership method of the leaders being responsible and personally taking action; the major plans for agricultural production, water conservancy projects and industrial construction were all personally formulated by the responsible comrades of the Party and the army. Commanders at all levels care about the lives and work of the fighters, and regularly inspect, check and urge the various units to accurately implement various production plans. Therefore, all plans can be completed on schedule.

The first production representative meeting of the Xinjiang Military Region held from December 29, 1951 to January 19, 1952 was an extremely important meeting. This meeting sharply criticized the bureaucratic work style of some commanders in leading production, determined the production tasks for 1952, so that the various production and construction undertakings of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang can be advanced more rapidly.

This meeting called on all commanders and fighters to strive for the establishment of large farms, large factories, and large pastures. It was decided that in 1952, 1.6 million mu of land should be cultivated in agricultural production, four mechanized farms should be established, the agricultural mechanization of 300,000 mu of land should be completed, and efforts should be made to harvest 220 million jin of grain, 10.95 million jin of ginned cotton, 79 million jin of horse feed, 7 million jin of oilseeds, and melons, fruits, vegetables, tobacco, etc. should be self-sufficient throughout the year in 1952. In 1953, efforts should be made to cultivate 3 million mu of land. In the spring of 1952 to 1953, ten demonstration collective farms of 10,000 mu to 15,000 mu of land should be assisted to farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In animal husbandry, it is required that each person have five sheep, five people have one cow, and one person has one chicken, and the Han troops have one pig for every three people. In water conservancy projects, the water conservancy projects in the Manas River and Ili River basins should be developed, and the water conservancy projects in Yanqi, Hami, Aksu, Dihua and other places should be continued, and 30 million cubic meters of earth and 1 million cubic meters of stone should be completed, so that an additional 1.5 million mu of land can be irrigated in 1953. In industrial construction, 300,000 square meters of factory buildings should be completed. It is difficult to take out huge funds now, but it is not impossible. Everyone should increase production and practice economy to solve the funding problem, and rely on the engineering corps as the main force to train 5,000 skilled construction workers. In order to solve the problem of technical cadres, they will strive to unite and transform all technical talents and experts who are willing to serve the people and the motherland, and run industrial schools to train communist youth technical cadres.

After the first production representative meeting of the Xinjiang Military Region, the entire army, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, launched a vigorous and vigorous struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. After this great struggle, after eliminating corruption, waste and bureaucracy, the confidence and enthusiasm of Xinjiang's troops in production and construction will be further enhanced, and new and greater victories will be achieved on the labor production front!

    驻新疆的解放军在生产战线上的胜利
    本报特约记者　胡中
    驻新疆的人民解放军从一九五零年进驻新疆的时候起，便按照毛主席关于部队参加生产的指示，坚苦地从事祖国边疆的生产建设事业。他们两年来的辛勤劳作，已显示出人民解放军是建设祖国边疆的伟大力量。只是一九五一年，他们就为国家创造了相当于一万亿元的财富。他们对建设祖国边疆，鼓舞各族人民积极从事建设事业，起了推动、带头和示范的作用。
    集体的农业劳动的优越性
    一九五零年，驻新疆人民解放军共垦殖了百万亩土地，收获粮食七千万斤，皮棉七十五万三千多斤，油籽三百二十二万一千多斤，瓜菜四千五百多万斤。一九五一年种植了九十八万多亩土地，收获粮食八千九百多万斤，皮棉一百一十多万斤，油籽三百九十多万斤，瓜菜苜蓿一亿八百多万斤。这就是说，一九五一年比一九五零年耕地减少了二万亩，而粮食却增加了百分之二十七，皮棉增加了百分之四十六，油籽增加了百分之二十一，瓜菜等增加得更多。
    这些数字还不能说明一九五一年农业生产战线上丰产成绩的全部事实。因为：第一，一九五一年有很大一部分部队参加了水利和工厂、营房建筑等工程，参加农业生产的人数是比一九五零年减少了。其次，在一九五一年的农业生产中，有一部分部队受指挥员的官僚主义作风的影响，没有得到好的收成；还有下了种而完全没有收成的。但从整个生产成果看来，各种作物的单位面积产量是显著地提高了；而且在几十亩、百余亩的大面积土地上出现了很高的单位面积产量。如每亩地小麦的最高产量达到八百斤，稻子达到一千三百零八斤，玉蜀黍达到一千二百七十斤，皮棉达到一百四十斤，甜菜（糖萝卜）达到一万五千斤。这些成绩显示出：即使是在冬季时间较长、气候变化较大的新疆，各种农作物也是可以达到高额产量的。
    丰收的显著成绩，充分地证明了集体劳动的优越性，也充分表现了人民军队的组织性、纪律性和高度的政治觉悟。农业生产工作是在新疆军区生产委员会严密的计划和领导下进行的。部队各级军事指挥机关都成立了生产委员会和生产合作社，具体领导生产工作，执行生产计划。各部队所进行的农业生产就是整个计划中的一个部分。他们通过生产代表会议、劳动模范代表会议等来交流和总结经验，并开展了新英雄主义的革命竞赛。这样，各部队就能具体地合理地组织劳动力，充分发挥了劳动效力。同时，因为集体劳动适宜于在大块土地上集中耕种一种作物，这就改变了个体农民在少量土地上种植好几种作物的不合理现象。这样，既便于管理各种农作物、节省劳动力和灌溉水量，又便于采用各种农作物轮种的制度，以恢复土地的肥力，使产量不断提高。
    驻新疆人民解放军度过了一九五○年“万事开头难”的艰苦困难时期，开辟了劳动生产战线，取得了生活资料以后，便用自己在生产中所增加的财富和一部分开支的节余，向苏联购进了大批新式的马拉农具。在一九五一年的农业生产中，各部队广泛地使用了步犁、“之”字耙、十行播种机、收割机等马拉农具。同时，各部队指战员们以高度的劳动生产热情和科学技术相结合，创造和改良了许多农具。某团在去年一年中就创造和改良了二十五种农具。这些农具的效率都比原有农具提高了二倍到五倍。如某连副班长杨茂林仿制了六行播种机；侦察通讯连木工陆玉虎创造了五行播种机，二人一马每天可播种四十亩。又如某部用石磙子打场，每天打粮食一万斤；石磙子后面拖上柳树条，可提高效率一倍。新式马拉农具和许多改良农具，是只有在集体劳动的情况下才能普遍地使用的。这些新农具的使用，使一九五一年农业生产的工作效率比一九五○年用砍土镘（形状像镢头）耕种时提高了一倍多，并且收到了丰产的效果。
    部队的集体劳动，使应用一切最进步的科学技术成为可能。在焉耆、迪化和玛纳斯河边石河子地区的农业试验场里，已开始用拖拉机和农业机器来耕种。指挥员、战斗员们相信，用农业机器来代替马拉农具已不是“远景”了。
    驻新疆人民解放军所创造的农业生产战线上的巨大成绩，给新疆各族人民以良好的影响。南疆疏附县的维吾尔族农民，已学会了人民解放军带来的先进的农作技术。一九五一年疏附县的小麦、玉米几种主要粮食作物的单位面积产量，已比解放前提高了百分之十九，比一九五零年提高了百分之八点四。阿克苏专区拜城县维吾尔族农民种庄稼，解放前都是撒播，解放后已学会了用耧条播。由于条播后出苗整齐，锄草方便，产量也就提高了。条播节省的籽种相当于拜城县农民去年所缴的全部公粮。由于新疆农民接受了先进的耕作法，一九五一年新疆省各种粮食每亩平均产量达一百七十斤，较一九五零年提高了百分之十点四。
    从人民解放军的大生产运动中，新疆人民已认识到集体劳动的优越性；他们对于使用新式马拉农具，特别是拖拉机和其他农业机器，感到极大的兴趣。现在他们已组织起了很多互助变工组。一九五一年新疆全省已经组织了九万一千多个互助组，参加互助组的各族农民有八十多万人，其中包括农村妇女二十九万多人。这种互助变工组在新疆农村实行土地改革以后，将会更大量地和向更高级的形式发展起来。驻新疆人民解放军，在伟大祖国的边疆，已树立了一面鲜明的旗帜，向新疆各族人民指出了农业生产集体化机械化的发展方向。
    变戈壁为绿洲的创举
    新疆是一个干旱地区，农田全部要靠人工灌溉；但水源却是充足的。有很多内陆河流，它们有着几十秒立方公尺或一百多秒立方公尺流量的水，都渗到沙漠中去了，没有加以利用。此外还有不少地方可以修筑蓄水库，积蓄起夏季洪水。在各个河流附近，有着千万亩未开垦的处女地。这些土地上虽有着一层薄的碱土，但在碱土的下面却是黑色的黏土和壤土。这些处女地只要锄去上面长着的野草，并有足够的水洗碱、灌溉，便可以开垦为肥沃的农田。
    驻新疆的人民解放军，在生产建设当中，一开始便重视了水利灌溉工程的建设。
    一九五零年，为了及时播种，主要是从事于小型水利灌溉工程的开发和旧有渠道的整修。这一年新修和整修的渠道共八十条，共长二百多万公尺；修建堤坝二万七千多公尺；修复蓄水库两个；共挖土填土二百余万立方公尺。新修和整修的渠道可灌溉一百二十七万亩土地。
    从一九五零年下半年起，驻新疆部队开始进行规模巨大的近代化水利灌溉工程建设。这是一个改造自然的伟大计划：要在五年内（一九五零年到一九五四年）完成灌溉五百万亩地的水利工程。这个计划里需要修建的渠道，有迪化和平渠、焉耆南岸解放第一渠、焉耆北岸解放第二渠、库尔勒十八团渠、哈密红星渠、阿克苏胜利渠以及开拓玛纳斯河和伊犁河流域的土地。其中，和平渠、解放第一渠、解放第二渠、十八团渠、红星渠、胜利渠等都已在一九五零年冬季和一九五一年分别动工。一九五一年已挖土填土九百三十多万立方公尺，铺石块十五万多立方公尺，完成跌水、桥梁、渡漕、分水闸、进水闸等建筑物一百零五座。
    一九五一年，除了进行这些大型水利灌溉工程以外，并新修和整修了小型渠道一百九十多条，修堤二千七百公尺，筑坝四千公尺，修建蓄水库三个，桥梁、渡漕等建筑物八十五座。这些渠道可灌溉四十六万多亩土地。
    水利灌溉工程的建设，使几十万、几百万亩整块的土地正在开垦出来。大块土地的开垦，给农业集体化创造了条件。以后，部队可以集中经营大块的土地，而把原来开垦的小块土地和能灌溉一万多亩土地的水渠让给新疆各族农民使用；并可把部队建筑的房屋和一部分农具让给各族农民，援助他们建立起示范的集体农庄，以逐渐取得新疆农业集体化的经验。
    植树护林方面，一九五一年春植树一百一十九万株，比一九五零年增加了五倍。团以上单位，大都设有苗圃，自己育苗，为以后大规模造林准备了有利的条件。
    “变戈壁为绿洲”曾经是新疆各族人民许多年来美丽的理想。现在，在人民解放军坚苦的劳动下，这个理想正逐渐成为呈现在人们眼前的现实了。
    把落后的地区工业化
    新疆过去是没有工业基础的，但新疆地下却埋藏着蕴藏量极为丰富的矿产。
    驻新疆人民解放军对工业建设也是很注意的。农业生产的发展决定于水利灌溉工程的建设，水利工程建设便需要大量钢筋和水泥；农产品的加工也需要建设工业。只有在边疆地区建立起大工厂来，才能顺利发展农业生产，才能最后地改变新疆的经济面貌，使新疆从落后的地区赶上先进的地区。
    工业建设需要有大量的投资。他们从农业生产中获得了生活资料，节约下伙食费和每月的津贴费，用合作社的形式把每一文钱都积累起来，用这笔资金开始进行燃料、动力、钢铁、水泥、机器修理、农产品加工和纺织、面粉、制糖等工业建设。
    工业建设是以异常迅速的速度在进行着。规模巨大的纺织厂是在一九五○年夏季开始设计的，今春便可以开工生产。钢铁厂、水泥厂、水力发电厂、火力发电厂和汽车修理厂都将在今年秋季以前开工生产。一九五一年七月开始挖掘的露天煤矿工程去冬已告完成，现在已经出煤；这就可以及时供应一九五二年各工厂开工时所需的足够的燃料。现在正着手准备打立井作永久的开采。这个矿区，原是一片荒凉的黄土滩，遍地是凹凸不平的坑洼。据一位专家的估计，按照现在的条件，这项工程最快也得要两年才可以完成。但是，解放军某部只用了四个多月的时间，就完成了把山丘挖成深坑、垫平二公里多长的深沟和挖掘十八万三千多土方的艰苦工程。新疆北部的气候非常寒冷，高原上的风卷着沙子。矿坑一天一天地深下去，困难也随着增加。但是，战士们高度的爱国主义的劳动热忱，不仅战胜了大风、大雪，还克服了地冻、路滑等各种困难。他们都深切地知道多挖一块土和多推一车土，对建设祖国的边疆所起的作用。
    两年来，参加工厂建筑的部队奋不顾身地劳动着。战士们在零下三十七度的恶劣气候下，把几千根粗大的木料从两百里路以外的山上，运到施工地区。有的手脚被冻烂，但他们的劳动情绪始终高涨。在工程中，指挥员、战斗员、工程人员和技术工人都发挥了高度的创造性。机砖厂每部压砖机的产量每天由一千三百块增加到三千二百块。砌砖墙的速率，已超过开始修建时的五倍。从事工程建筑的指战员们很快学会了他们以前所不会的技术。原来在钢骨水泥的建筑工程中，所有技术工人都是从关内请来的；现在参加建筑工程的人员都成为熟练工人了，其中有一千三百人已培养成为扎钢筋、灌洋灰、铁工、木工、油漆工等熟练的技术工人。一九五一年，他们完成了工厂、营房等建筑十一万多平方公尺。他们在一片荒凉的草原上修建着一座新的城市。
    争取新的更大的胜利
    过去两年来，驻新疆人民解放军从事各项劳动生产建设中的伟大成绩，是全体指战员在爱国主义和国际主义的教育下，忘我地从事劳动生产，克服了一九五零年上半年的严重困难和某些指挥员对生产信心不足的思想，逐渐学会了各种生产技术的结果。特别是中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的英勇、艰苦的战斗，大大鼓舞了全体指战员的劳动热情。他们说：“我们和在朝鲜战场上的中国人民志愿军相比，劳动再艰苦一点又算得什么？”他们提出了“巩固祖国边疆，加速祖国边疆的经济建设便是支援抗美援朝的实际行动”的战斗口号。这个口号在各项生产建设工作中起着巨大作用。
    驻新疆人民解放军部队首长采取了首长负责、亲自动手的领导方法；农业生产、水利工程和工业建设的重大计划，都是党、军方面的负责同志亲自拟定的。各级指挥员关心着战士们的生活和劳动，经常巡视、检查和督促各部队准确地执行各项生产计划。因此，各项计划都能够按期完成。
    一九五一年十二月二十九日到一九五二年一月十九日所召开的新疆军区第一次生产代表会议是一个极为重要的会议。这个会议尖锐地批评了某些指挥员领导生产中的官僚主义作风，确定了一九五二年的生产任务，使驻新疆人民解放军的各项生产建设事业能够更迅速地向前推进。
    这个会议号召全体指战员为建立大农场、大工厂、大牧场而奋斗。决定一九五二年在农业生产上要耕种一百六十万亩土地，成立四个机械化农场，完成三十万亩地的农业机械化工作，争取一九五二年收获粮食二亿二千万斤，皮棉一千零九十五万斤，马料七千九百万斤，油籽七百万斤，瓜果、菜蔬、烟草等则要达到全年自给。一九五三年要争取耕种三百万亩土地。要在一九五二年到一九五三年春，援助新疆各族农民建立一万亩到一万五千亩地的示范的集体农庄十个。在畜牧业上要求每人有五只羊，五人一头牛，一人一只鸡，汉族成份的部队每三人一口猪。在水利工程上，要着手开发玛纳斯河和伊犁河流域的水利工程，继续进行焉耆、哈密、阿克苏、迪化等地的水利工程，要完成土方三千万立方公尺、石方一百万立方公尺，使一九五三年能再多灌溉一百五十万亩土地。在工业建设上要完成三十万平方公尺的工厂建筑。现在拿出巨大资金是困难的，但是不是不可能的。大家要增产节约来解决资金问题，要依靠工兵团为主干锻炼出五千名熟练的建筑工人。为解决技术干部问题，他们争取团结改造一切愿为人民祖国服务的技术人才和专家，并且要办工业学校，培养共产主义的青年技术干部。
    在新疆军区第一次生产代表会议以后，全军遵照毛主席的指示，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。经过这一个伟大的斗争，消灭了贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象后，新疆部队生产建设的信心和热情将更加提高，将在劳动生产战线上取得新的更大的胜利！
