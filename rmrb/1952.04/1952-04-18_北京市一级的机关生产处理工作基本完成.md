According to the decision issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on March 12 concerning the unified handling of agency production, the Beijing Municipal People's Government established the Beijing Municipal Agency Production Handling Committee on March 19 and began the handling work.

The steps of the processing work were: first, to register and inventory assets and verify funds; second, to hand over management to certain state-owned enterprise departments or administrative departments according to their nature, and gradually rectify them to gradually move towards planned production.

In terms of asset inventory and fund verification, most of the 80 municipal-level agency production units carried out asset inventory and valuation. The work of fund verification was not carried out because the past systems of these units were not sound enough, production management was not on track, and planning work was very incomplete. This work is planned to be carried out by the new leading department after takeover.

In order to ensure the timely completion of the unified handling of agency production, and to be able to systematically merge many units under decentralized leadership into the leadership of several state-owned enterprise departments or administrative departments for rectification, the Beijing Municipal People's Government decided to establish or supplement the following institutions based on the specific circumstances of agency production in the city, to take over the relevant production units respectively.

I. There used to be a lot of waste in Beijing's building materials, especially bricks, in terms of specifications, quality, and transportation. In order to overcome this state of anarchy in production and transportation, it was decided to establish the "Beijing Building Materials Company." This company will not only take over the building materials production units produced by agencies, but also gradually unify the building materials production units of municipal enterprises and strengthen production planning.

II. The original Beijing Public Enterprise Company is supplementing its organization to accept new tasks. The former Yongmao Industrial Company has been incorporated into the company's leadership. In the future, it is also planned to establish several management organizations by industry, such as flour, chemical, machinery, and textile.

III. Automobile transportation and repair units will be taken over and rectified by the Beijing Transportation Company and the Beijing Public Transport Company, respectively.

IV. The construction industry will be uniformly taken over by the Beijing Construction Company; coal mines will be uniformly taken over by the Jingxi Mining Bureau; commercial properties will be taken over and rectified by the Industry and Commerce Bureau; and some properties of supply and marketing nature or suitable for development towards cooperatives will be handed over to the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation for takeover.

The processing of agency production in Beijing is planned to be basically completed before the end of April. In order not to affect production, the takeover work must be carried out quickly. Therefore, the general principle of takeover is to check first and then clear, and the clearing should not delay production.

As of now, the takeover and processing of agency production at the municipal level has been basically completed. With the exception of a small number of canteens, bathrooms, and theaters that are still awaiting final processing, a total of 63 units have been taken over.

Currently, the processing of agency production at the central and North China levels that has been handed over to Beijing for local takeover has begun.

### 北京市一级的机关生产处理工作基本完成

    北京市一级的机关生产处理工作基本完成
    【本报讯】根据中央人民政府政务院三月十二日发布的关于统一处理机关生产的决定，北京市人民政府在三月十九日成立了北京市机关生产处理委员会，着手进行处理工作。
    处理工作的步骤是，首先进行登记和清理资产、核定资金，其次按性质交给一定的国营企业部门或行政部门经营管理，并逐步加以整顿，使之逐渐走向计划生产。
    在进行清理资产、核定资金的工作上，市一级的八十个机关生产单位，绝大部分进行了资产的清理和估价；核定资金工作则由于这些单位过去的制度不够健全，生产管理未上轨道和计划工作很不完备，都没有进行。这个工作，准备在接收以后由新的领导部门负责进行。
    为了保证及时完成统一处理机关生产的工作，并且能够有计划、有步骤地把分散领导的许多单位归并到几个国营企业部门或行政部门的领导下面加以整顿，北京市人民政府根据本市机关生产的具体情况决定设立或充实以下机构，分别接管有关的生产单位。
    一、北京市建筑器材在规格、质量的问题上和调运上曾经有很大的浪费，特别以砖的问题最为严重。为了克服这种生产与调运上的无政府状态，决定设立“北京市建筑器材公司”。这个公司不仅要接管机关生产的建筑材料生产单位，而且进一步还要把市营企业的建筑材料生产单位逐渐统一并加强生产计划性。
    二、原北京市公营企业公司为接受新的任务，正在充实机构。目前已将前永茂实业公司并入该公司的领导之下，将来还准备按行业建立几个管理机构，如面粉、化工、机器、纺织等。
    三、汽车运输及修配的单位分别由北京市运输公司及北京市公共汽车公司进行接管并加以整顿。
    四、建筑业由北京市建筑公司统一接管；煤矿由京西矿务处统一接管；商业性质的由工商局接收整顿；有些供销性质或适宜于向合作社前途发展的，则交给北京市供销合作总社接管。
    北京市机关生产的处理工作，计划在四月底以前基本上结束。为了不影响生产，接管工作必须迅速进行，因此接管的方针一般是先点后清，清点不误生产。
    截至目前止，市一级机关生产的接管处理工作，基本上已经完毕，除去食堂、浴室、剧院等一小部分尚待最后处理外，已经接管完毕的共六十三个单位。
    目前，中央一级和华北一级交给北京市地方接管的机关生产的处理工作已开始在进行中。
