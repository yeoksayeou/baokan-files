    Interview with Nat Sainander, Head of the Swedish Trade Union Delegation
    "In Sweden, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is seen as a decisive victory for the peace camp over the imperialist camp." Nat Sainander, head of the Swedish trade union delegation invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend China's "May Day" celebrations, first conveyed to the reporter the Swedish people's view of New China.

    This Swedish Member of Parliament succinctly summarized his impressions of New China. He said: "It is obvious that the liberation of the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, from the long-term shackles of imperialism is a major event of world historical significance. And today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, China has laid a solid foundation for its smooth development towards socialism."

    Nat Sainander affirmed: "The victory of the Chinese people supports peace-loving countries around the world, and also supports the struggles of working people around the world."

    In just a few days in Beijing, the Swedish delegation gained a deep impression from visiting only a few major universities and middle schools. Nat Sainander said: "Although these universities and middle schools currently lack favorable conditions, and there are still some old influences left over from old China, we have personally seen the increase in the number of students, and it is continuing to increase rapidly. At the same time, due to the reform of the education system, the purpose of education is more beneficial to the people of the whole country. For example, fifty percent of workers' children study at Beijing No. 8 Middle School, which we consider a great success. Sweden has not suffered the disasters of two world wars, but in Swedish higher education institutions, workers' children account for only three percent." He excitedly said: "In everything we have seen, we deeply feel that China will certainly be able to draw great strength from the broad masses of the people, which is necessary for building a new China. The New China's youth’s love of life and happiness, as well as their strong confidence in the future of the great motherland, have made a particularly vivid and profound impression on us. The youth also showed their trust and love for Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao Zedong's care for the health of the youth and his affection for them are also sincerely appreciated by the youth, all of which is unforgettable for us."

    Speaking of the Swedish people's struggle for peace, Nat Sainander said excitedly: "The Swedish people have a tradition of loving peace. Our country has lived in peace for 140 years, and we have not suffered destruction in the two world wars. However, the Swedish people are still actively participating in the struggle to defend world peace. Nevertheless, in our sacred work of striving for peace, we still encounter some difficulties, because our labor movement has been split due to the reactionary policies implemented by the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party. However, 318,000 people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and more than 300,000 people have signed the appeal for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact to date, and the signature campaign is still ongoing. We have 300 local peace committees distributed throughout the country. In a newspaper called "Peaceful Life" published by the Swedish Peace Congress, there are often articles written by excellent and progressive writers, such as World Peace Council Vice-Chairman and famous writer Lundkvist."

    He said: The great movement of the Swedish people's struggle for peace is developing enthusiastically and universally throughout the country. (Wang Zhen) (Attached picture)

    访瑞典工会代表团团长纳特·赛南德
    “在瑞典，把中国人民革命的胜利，看作和平阵营对帝国主义阵营的一个决定性的胜利”。应中华全国总工会的邀请前来参加我国“五一”节观礼的瑞典工会代表团团长纳特·赛南德首先对记者传达了瑞典人民对新中国的看法。
    这位瑞典国会议员，用简短的语句概括地说明了他对新中国的印象。他说：“很明显的，占有全世界人口四分之一的中国人民，从帝国主义长期束缚下解放出来，是具有世界历史意义的大事件。而且今天中国在共产党的领导下，已经为它顺利地发展到社会主义奠定了坚实的基础。”
    纳特·赛南德肯定地指出：“中国人民的胜利，支援了全世界爱好和平的国家，同时也支援了全世界劳动人民的斗争。”
    在北京短短的几天中，瑞典代表团仅仅参观了几个大中学校，就已获得了深刻的印象。纳特·赛南德说：“尽管这些大学和中学目前还缺乏优越的条件，也还存在着旧中国遗留下来的若干旧影响；但是我们亲眼看到了学生数量的增加，而且还在继续地迅速地增加中。同时由于教育制度的改革，教育目的更有利于全国人民了。举一个例：百分之五十的工人子弟在北京市第八中学学习，我们认为这是很大的成功。瑞典没有遭受过两次世界大战的灾害，然而在瑞典的高等学校中工人子弟只占百分之三。”他兴奋地说：“我们在看到的一切中，深切地体会到中国一定能从广大的人民中间取得伟大的力量，这些力量是建设新中国所必要的。新中国的青年们对生活的热爱和愉快以及对伟大祖国前途的坚强信心，对我们造成了特别鲜明而深刻的印象。青年们同样表现了对中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的信任和爱戴，毛泽东主席照顾青年们的健康和爱抚青年，同样受到青年们衷心的感激，这些都使我们难于忘怀。”
    谈到瑞典人民为争取和平而斗争时，纳特·赛南德激动地说：“瑞典人民是具有爱好和平的传统的，我们的国家一百四十年来一直过着和平的生活，在两次世界大战中我们都没有蒙受到破坏，但是瑞典人民还是积极地参加保卫世界和平的斗争。虽然如此，在我们争取和平的神圣工作中，仍然遇到了一些困难，因为我们的劳工运动，由于社会民主党右翼领袖所执行的反动政策而分裂了。然而我们在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的有三十一万八千人，在要求缔结五大国和平公约上签名的迄今为止已有三十余万人，而且签名运动仍在进行中。我们有三百个地方和平委员会分布在全国，在瑞典和平大会出版的一种名为“和平生活”的报纸上，经常有优秀的和进步的作家写文章，如世界和平理事会副主席、著名作家伦德奎斯特，就是其中的一个。”
    他说：瑞典人民为争取和平而斗争的伟大运动正在全国热烈地普遍地开展着。（王真）（附图片）
