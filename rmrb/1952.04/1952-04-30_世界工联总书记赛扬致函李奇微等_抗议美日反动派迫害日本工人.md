Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), wrote letters on March 26th to General Matthew Ridgway, Commander of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Japan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, protesting the illegal measures taken by American and Japanese reactionaries to deprive Japanese workers of their legitimate rights and suppress the Japanese trade union movement, and demanding the unconditional release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

The letters pointed out that Japanese workers have been deprived of the rights granted to them by the Japanese Constitution. The "National Public Service Law," enacted in 1948 in violation of the Japanese Constitution, deprives all government employees, including teachers, civil servants, and postal workers, of the right to strike, participate in election activities, or engage in collective bargaining and conclude collective contracts. The "Local Public Service Law" of December 1950 extended the "National Public Service Law" to employees of local autonomous governments. The letters also stated that the infringement of trade union rights is also reflected in the dissolution of the National Liaison Council of Trade Unions in 1950 and the "purge" of its twelve leaders, as well as the imprisonment of trade union leaders.

Saillant specifically pointed out in the letters that the fabrication of the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" and the shocking verdicts against the victims of this incident were clearly aimed at alienating trade union members from their militant activities. Currently, 13,000 Japanese trade union members have been expelled from trade union activities.

After condemning the attempts by American and Japanese reactionaries to deprive Japanese trade unions of the freedom of assembly and demonstration and drafting a law prohibiting general strikes, the letters stated that such measures to deprive Japanese trade unions of their rights have aroused widespread resistance among Japanese workers.

Saillant concluded by saying that the WFTU, representing tens of millions of organized workers worldwide, demands an end to the Japanese government's infringement on the trade union movement and requests the withdrawal of the prosecution against the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and their immediate unconditional release.

In the protest letter to Shigeru Yoshida, Saillant demanded the withdrawal of the legislation suppressing trade unions and guaranteed that there would be no further persecution of trade union activities in the future.

    世界工联总书记赛扬致函李奇微等
    抗议美日反动派迫害日本工人
    【新华社二十九日讯】世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，在三月二十六日分别写信给美国驻日占领军司令李奇微、联合国秘书长和日本首相吉田茂，抗议美、日反动派剥夺日本工人的合法权利和镇压日本工会运动的种种非法措施，并要求无条件释放“松川事件”无辜被告。
    信中指出：日本工人已经被剥夺了日本宪法所赋予的权利。一九四八年制订的违反日本宪法的“国家公务员法”，剥夺了所有政府工作人员，包括教员、公务员、邮政工作人员在内，实行罢工、参加选举活动或者进行集体谈判和缔结集体合同的权利。一九五○年十二月的“地方公务员法”，又使“国家公务员法”适用于地方自治政府的工作人员。信中又说：对工会权利的侵害还表现在一九五○年解散全国工会联络协议会并“整肃”其十二名领袖和将工会领袖投狱的事件上。
    赛扬在信中特别指出：捏造所谓“松川事件”并对这一事件的牺牲者作了惊人的判决，其目的显然是要使工会会员脱离其战斗性的活动。现在已有一万三千名日本工会会员被逐出工会活动。
    信中指责美、日反动派企图剥夺日本工会的集会和游行的自由并草拟禁止总罢工法之后说：这种剥夺日本工会的权利的措施，已在日本工人中间引起了广泛的反抗。
    赛扬最后说：世界工联代表全世界数千万有组织的工人，要求制止日本政府对工会运动的侵害，并要求撤销对“松川事件”无辜被告的起诉，立即无条件释放他们。
    在致吉田茂的抗议信中，赛扬要求撤回镇压工会的立法，保证以后决不再对工会活动进行迫害。
