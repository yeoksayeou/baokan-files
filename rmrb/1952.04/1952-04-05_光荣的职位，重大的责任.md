    A Glorious Position, a Great Responsibility
    Le Songsheng
    Vice President of the Beijing People's Court, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce
    The Beijing People's Court has been formally established in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and will begin handling cases of "completely illegal" and "seriously illegal" industrialists and businessmen in the "Five-Anti" movement. I have been appointed as the Vice President of the Beijing People's Court. This serious task makes me feel very honored and responsible. In terms of my class nature and ability, holding such a position in this great movement is disproportionate. I will certainly, under the leadership of the government, follow the laws and regulations, and do my best to accomplish the glorious mission entrusted to me by the people.
    The basic spirit of the policy and guidelines for the Beijing People's Court in handling cases is "combining severity with leniency, and combining reform with punishment," that is, using the Beijing Municipal People's Government's "Standards and Measures for Classifying and Handling Industrialists and Businessmen in the Five-Anti Movement" and "Regulations on the Establishment of People's Courts in the Five-Anti Movement" as weapons, and following Chairman Mao's instructions: "leniency in the past, strictness in the future; leniency towards the majority, strictness towards the minority; leniency for those who confess, strictness for those who resist; leniency towards industry, strictness towards commerce; leniency towards ordinary commerce, strictness towards speculative commerce," handling problems with principles and distinctions.
    The great significance of the "Five-Anti" movement will become increasingly clear with the development of history. Through this movement, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen will be educated and reformed. They have made mistakes in the past, but as long as they thoroughly correct them, abide by the Common Program, obey the leadership of the working class, and participate in the construction of the new democratic economy, their future is still bright. For the extremely small number of unscrupulous merchants who are guilty of all five evils, are of a bad nature, and seriously endanger the interests of the country and the people, the People's Court must deal with them seriously, otherwise it will be impossible to consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Five-Anti" movement; but those who can thoroughly confess, expose meritorious deeds, and sincerely repent can be given a lighter punishment as appropriate.
    The positive significance of the "Five-Anti" movement is to reform industrialists and businessmen and further consolidate the people's democratic power and the united front. This is a fierce struggle within the people. Only through struggle can we be more united. Therefore, the policy of "combining severity with leniency, and combining reform with punishment" is completely correct.

    光荣的职位，重大的责任
    北京市人民法庭副审判长  北京市工商联副主任委员  乐松生
    北京市人民法庭依据中央人民政府政务院的指示已经正式成立，并将开始处理“五反”运动中“完全违法”和“严重违法”工商户的案件。我被任命为北京市人民法庭的副审判长。这个严肃的任务，使我感到非常光荣和责任的重大。以我的阶级性和能力而论，在这伟大运动中担任这样的职务是不相称的。我一定在政府领导之下，遵循法令，竭尽微薄，来完成人民所赋予我的光荣使命。
    北京市人民法庭处理案件的政策方针的基本精神，是“严肃和宽大相结合，改造与惩治相结合”，即以北京市人民政府“在五反运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”及“关于五反运动中成立人民法庭的规定”两大文件，作为武器，并遵循毛主席指示的：“过去从宽，今后从严；多数从宽，少数从严；坦白从宽，抗拒从严；工业从宽，商业从严；普通商业从宽，投机商业从严”的五项原则，有原则有区别地处理问题。
    “五反”运动的伟大意义，将随历史的发展益为明显。通过这个运动，有绝大部分工商业者得到教育和改造。他们过去犯有错误，但只要彻底改过，遵循共同纲领，服从工人阶级领导，参加新民主主义经济建设，其前途仍是光明的。对于为数极少的五毒俱全、性质恶劣而又严重危害国家人民利益的奸商，则必须由人民法庭加以严肃处理，否则就无法巩固“五反”运动的胜利果实；但对其中能彻底坦白、检举立功、确愿真诚悔改者，尚可酌情减轻处分。
    “五反”运动的积极意义，是为着改造工商业者，更加巩固人民民主政权和统一战线，这是人民内部的激烈斗争。只有经过斗争才能更加团结。因此，“严肃和宽大相结合，改造和惩治相结合”的政策方针，是完全正确的。
