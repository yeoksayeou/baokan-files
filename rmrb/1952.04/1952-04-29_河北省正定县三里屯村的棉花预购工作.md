Cotton Pre-Purchase Work in Sanlitun Village, Zhengding County, Hebei Province
    Guo Xianrui
    Sanlitun Village, Zhengding County, has a total of 155 households with 912 people, cultivating 2,470 mu of land. This year, it plans to plant cotton on 588 mu, estimating a yield of 78,325 jin of seed cotton. All 155 households are members of the supply and marketing cooperative, with a total of 256 members organized into 14 groups. The foundation of production mutual aid organizations in this village is relatively weak, with only two relatively stable high-yield mutual aid teams. The rest are mostly temporary or small mutual aid teams consisting of only three or four people. In this trial pre-purchase work, all households except one that did not grow cotton accepted the pre-purchase. The pre-purchase targets were the 14 cooperative member groups and two high-yield mutual aid teams, signing a total of 16 collective pre-purchase contracts, pre-purchasing 41,360 jin of seed cotton, accounting for 52.82% of the village's planned total output. Pre-purchase orders (i.e., order forms) accounted for 33.65% of the total value of pre-purchased cotton, of which grain accounted for 13.58%, foreign cloth accounted for 2.44%, and coal and salt accounted for 17.63%.

    The pre-purchase of cotton in Sanlitun Village was carried out as follows:

    First, based on the village's cotton planting area and output, pre-purchase tasks were assigned, calculating the amount of various pre-ordered goods and advance payments from the cooperative to cotton farmers, stipulating the payment time for each type of material, and preparing for reprinting contracts and order forms.

    Second, at an enlarged meeting of village cadres, the cooperative reviewed last year's pre-purchase work (last year, due to the cooperative's lack of experience and hasty arrangements, many contracts were poorly written, and the materials could not be supplied according to the variety and time specified in the contract when the cotton was harvested); and explained the importance and specific methods of this year's pre-purchase of cotton. In this way, the cadres' thinking was straightened out, and all the village cadres were mobilized. With the village cadres as the main force, they widely publicized the importance of pre-purchasing to the masses through the Party, government, and youth league organizations and member representatives. They also actively mobilized the masses by cultivating key individuals to lead the general population, based on groups and households, to make preliminary plans for pre-selling cotton and ordering goods. Then, the cooperative convened a joint meeting of member representatives and group leaders, inviting the village chief to participate, to review and revise these plans and return them to the groups for approval. Finally, at a village-wide mass meeting, the completion of the tasks was announced, and a challenge competition was launched between groups to ensure the successful execution of the contracts.

    In the pre-purchase work in Sanlitun Village, there are the following experiences:

    First, the facts prove that "credit pre-purchase" can be universally implemented. It was explained to the masses that cotton farmers pre-sold their cotton to the state last year, and the state also pre-sold several materials to cotton farmers, buying inexpensive goods from last year's pre-purchase orders; and that the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the country's economic construction require a large amount of materials, and cotton farmers should start from the overall interests of the country and not only see their own temporary interests. In addition to pre-ordering goods, they should also understand that the purpose of signing pre-purchase contracts is to guarantee mutual credit. Some cotton farmers said on the spot: "We will not pay a deposit for the goods we order from the state, and we will not ask for a deposit when we pre-sell cotton to the state!" This shows that the method of "credit pre-purchase" can be universally implemented. The use of advance payments in this village is controlled by the grassroots cooperative. Because the reasons were explained to the masses, after joint research by member representatives, group leaders, and the village chief, the deposit was only distributed to 33 cotton farmers who were indeed in difficulty to support their production, accounting for 21.43% of the 154 cotton farming households in the village; the advance payment totaled 1.87 million yuan, accounting for 1.59% of the total value of the pre-purchased cotton. In fact, it is absolutely necessary to prepay a portion of the deposit to cotton farmers who are indeed in difficulty to support their production.

    Second, the signing of pre-purchase cotton contracts and order forms must be combined with cotton farmers' production increase plans and consumption plans. This can not only promote the realization of production increase plans, but also prevent cotton farmers from signing more pre-purchase cotton contracts in order to order more goods, leading to the failure of the contracts, or cotton farmers pre-selling too little cotton, preventing the cooperative from completing the pre-purchase cotton tasks. In this contract signing, in addition to the high-yield mutual aid teams proposing pre-sale quantities according to the production increase plan, ordinary cotton farmers, although enthusiastic about increasing production, had concerns about the production increase plan not being realized and fearing to expose their wealth. When making order plans, they generally requested a wide variety and quantity of goods. According to the initial statistics of five groups, the total amount of orders reached 75% of the total pre-purchase value (this exceeds the requirements of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives; according to the requirements of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the order amount accounts for 30% of the total pre-purchase value), of which grain accounted for 51% of the total order value, coal accounted for 33.3%, cloth accounted for 10.7%, and salt accounted for 5%. This shows that the four main materials stipulated by the state for pre-purchase cotton are suitable for the needs of cotton farmers, especially grain and coal. At the same time, there are also individual households who plan to order more cloth, the value of which exceeds the total value of their pre-sold cotton; this is an attempt to resell it and is very noteworthy. Many cotton farmers require the goods to be delivered early, especially expressing dissatisfaction with the late supply of grain last year. Therefore, it is very necessary to strictly review the quantity of orders, especially to avoid grain and cloth exceeding the prescribed proportions, so as not to cause insufficient supply and loss of credibility with farmers. In addition to the four main materials guaranteed by the state, cotton farmers also have urgent needs for fertilizers, kerosene, and other materials. For example, according to a survey of seven households, they require 3,000 jin of fertilizer to be supplied during the autumn wheat planting season. Therefore, in addition to the goods guaranteed by the state, the cooperative should also formulate its own supply plan according to the needs of cotton farmers, investigate and statistically analyze the needs of the groups that have signed pre-purchase contracts, and organize local purchases, so that the cooperative's supply and marketing plan and cotton farmers' production and consumption plans are further integrated to meet the diverse material needs of the members.

    Third, cotton farmers welcome the method of signing pre-purchase contracts in groups, believing that this can overcome the shortcomings of frequent congestion and delays in work when delivering cotton and picking up goods. Therefore, the method of the cooperative signing pre-purchase contracts with the village's existing production organizations and member groups is correct.

    Fourth, after signing the contract, the cooperative must maintain close contact with the groups that signed the contract, regularly convene them to discuss cotton cultivation technology, and promptly supply production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural tools according to their needs. In this way, it can maintain long-term and organized close economic ties with farmers, help them develop production, and consolidate the foundation of the cooperative.

    河北省正定县三里屯村的棉花预购工作
    郭献瑞
    正定县三里屯全村共有一百五十五户，九百一十二人，耕地二千四百七十亩，今年计划植棉五百八十八亩，估计可产籽棉七万八千三百二十五斤。一百五十五户中每户都有供销合作社的社员，社员共二百五十六人，编为十四个小组；这个村生产互助组织基础较差，仅有两个较固定的丰产互助组，其余多为临时性的或只包括三、四人的小型互助组。这次试行预购工作中，除全村没种棉花的一户外，都接受了预购。预购的对象是十四个社员小组和两个丰产互助组，共签订了集体的预购合同十六件，预购了籽棉四万一千三百六十斤，占全村计划总产量的百分之五十二点八二。预购定货（即定货单）占预购棉花总值的百分之三十三点六五，其中粮食占百分之十三点五八，洋布占百分之二点四四，煤和盐共占百分之十七点六三。
    三里屯村的预购棉花工作是这样进行的：
    首先，根据全村种棉亩数和产量布置预购任务，计算出棉农各种预定货物和合作社预付定金的数字，规定每种物资的支付时间，同时作好翻印合同和定货单等准备工作。
    其次，在全村干部扩大会议上，合作社检讨了去年的预购工作（去年由于合作社缺乏经验，布置草率，不少合同订得乱，到收棉时不能按照合同规定的品种、时间供应物资）；并讲明今年预购棉花的重要性和具体作法。这样，打通了干部思想，把全村干部发动起来，以村干部为主，分片地通过党、政、团的组织和社员代表，广泛地向群众进行宣传；并以培养重点带动一般的办法，积极地发动群众，以小组为单位，以户为基础，作出预售棉花和定货的初步计划。然后，再由合作社召开社员代表、小组长联席会议，邀请村长参加，审查、修改这些计划，交回小组通过。最后，在全村群众大会上，宣布完成任务的情况，发动组和组之间的挑战竞赛，以保证合同的圆满执行。
    在三里屯村预购工作中，有以下几点体验：
    第一、事实证明“信用预购”工作是可以普遍开展的。向群众说明：棉农去年把棉花预售给了国家，而国家也预售给棉农几种物资，从去年预购定货中，买到了廉价的物品；并说明：抗美援朝和国家经济建设都需要大量的物资，棉农应从国家整体利益出发，不应只看到个人一时的利益，在预定了货物之外再向国家要定金，要明白订立预购合同就在于互相保证信用。有的棉农当场就说：“咱定了国家的货不出定金，把棉花预售给国家也不要定金！”这说明“信用预购”的办法是可以普遍开展的。这个村预付定金的使用是由基层社掌握的。由于向群众说明了道理，经社员代表、小组长和村长共同研究后，定金只分配给确有困难的棉农三十三户，支持他们进行生产，占全村一百五十四户棉农的百分之二十一点四三；预付定金共一百八十七万元，占预购棉总值的百分之一点五九。事实上，对确有困难的棉农预付一部定金，支持他们进行生产，也是完全必要的。
    第二、订立预购棉花合同和定货单，必须和棉农的增产计划、消费计划相结合。这样，既能促使增产计划的实现，也能防止棉农为了多定货而多订立预购棉花合同以至使合同落空，或棉农预售太少使合作社不能完成预购棉花任务的情形。在这次订立合同中，除丰产互助组按增产计划提出预售数量外，一般棉农虽有增产热情，但有怕增产计划不能实现和怕露富的思想顾虑。他们在做定货计划时，一般是要求定货的种类和数量多。据五个组的最初统计；定货总额达预购总值的百分之七十五（这是超过全国合作总社的要求的；按全国合作总社要求，定货额占预购总值的百分之三十），其中粮食占定货总值的百分之五十一，煤占百分之三十三点三，布占百分之十点七，盐占百分之五。这说明：国家规定的作为预购棉花之用的四种主要物资，是适合棉农需要的，特别是粮食和煤炭。同时，也有个别户计划多定购布匹，价值超过了他预售棉花的总值；这是企图转卖，是很值得注意的。不少的棉农要求货物早到手，特别对去年粮食未按时供应表示不满。因此，严格审查定货数量，特别是不要使粮食和布超过规定的比例，是非常必要的，以免供应不及，失信于农民。除国家保证供应的四种主要物资外，棉农对肥料、煤油及其他物资的要求也很迫切。如根据七户调查，就要求在秋季种麦时供应肥料三千斤。因此，合作社除了国家保证供应的货物外，还应根据棉农需要，制订本身的供应计划，调查统计已订预购合同的小组的需要，组织地方进货，使合作社的供销计划和棉农的生产、消费计划进一步地结合起来，以满足社员群众多样的物质要求。
    第三、棉农对于以小组为单位订预购合同的办法是欢迎的，他们认为这样可以克服在交棉取货时经常拥挤误工的缺点。因此，合作社和村内现有的各种生产组织、社员小组签订预购合同的办法是正确的。
    第四、在订立合同以后，合作社必须和签订合同的小组取得密切联系，定期召集他们开会，研究棉花培植技术；并按照他们的要求，及时地供应肥料、农药和农具等生产资料。这样，就能长期和有组织的农民在经济上密切联系，帮助他们发展生产，并巩固合作社的基础。
