Letters from many university and middle school students continue to arrive at this newspaper, expressing their determination to extinguish the flames of America's germ warfare.

Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, Ren Hanfen and seven others, wrote: "When we saw the news in Pravda and People's Daily about the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea and on the territory of our great motherland, we were extremely angry. Here in the Soviet Union, we are determined to protest against the bacteriological warfare waged by the American bandits with practical actions of studying hard, improving our political consciousness, and striving to complete the tasks assigned to us by the people of the motherland." Xie Huangmeng and 26 other students from the All-China Students Federation Preparatory Committee wrote: "From the fact that American imperialism is conducting bacteriological warfare in an inhuman way, we have a clearer understanding of the hideous face of American imperialism and its insane conspiracy. We are willing to fight on the job of building the motherland with practical actions to smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism." The "Struggle against American Imperialism's Bacteriological Warfare" meeting held at Renmin University of China wrote: "We are determined to respond to all the calls of the motherland at any time and fight against bacteriological warfare! We demand that the germ warfare criminals be severely punished!" Students from Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing Railway Institute and Tangshan Institute of Technology, Beijing Agricultural University, Shandong University, Shandong Agricultural College, Northwest Institute of Technology and other schools expressed their indignation in their letters: In order to smash the germ warfare of American imperialism, they are willing to dedicate everything! In the letters from middle school students, they also expressed their determination to oppose American bacteriological warfare with practical actions. The preparatory committee for the joint party of five schools including Beijing Industrial and Agricultural Fast Middle School wrote: "More than 1,300 of us are determined to answer the conspiracy of the American aggressors to carry out bacteriological warfare with practical actions to step up our studies and quickly complete our study tasks so as to go to the forefront of building and defending the motherland as soon as possible." The correspondent group of Xuanhua Middle School in Chahar Province wrote: "In addition to requesting the relevant leaders to approve us to go to the forefront of anti-bacterial warfare, we also guarantee that: In the city, we will universally publicize the conspiracy of American bandits to carry out bacterial warfare to the masses. In rural areas, we will publicize drought prevention and preparations for farming to farmers, and encourage the folks to quickly launch a patriotic production movement of 100 villages, 1,000 groups, and 10,000 households to fight back against the American aggressors."
