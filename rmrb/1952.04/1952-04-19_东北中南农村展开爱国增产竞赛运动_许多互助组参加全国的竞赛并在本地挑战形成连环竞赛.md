A large-scale patriotic production increase competition movement is unfolding in the rural areas of Northeast China. As of now, the farms participating in the national competition include the Chahayang Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province, the Keshan Agricultural Experiment Station, the Tongbei County Demonstration Farm, the Xiongyue Agricultural Experiment Station and the Xi'an County Farm in Liaodong Province, the Chengde Branch of the Agricultural Experiment Station in Rehe Province, and twenty-three demonstration farms in Liaoxi Province. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams participating in the national competition include those led by labor models such as Du Chang from Rehe Province, Meng Qingyu from Heilongjiang Province, Zhang Wenchun from Liaodong Province, Zhang Fuling from Songjiang Province, He Fengshan from Jilin Province, and Liu Hongda from Liaoxi Province. Productive models responding to the challenge include dozens of wheat productive model Lan Guohuan, rice productive model Nan Xuanting, and cotton planting model Xuan Yumin. In addition, women in Chengjihao Village in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, and Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team in Chahayang Farm have also actively participated in the competition. These farms, cooperative mutual aid organizations, and farmers who responded to the challenge simultaneously launched challenges locally, forming a wave of regional interlocking competitions. In addition, Heilongjiang Province, led by the province's first mutual aid model village—Minji Village in Suihua County—launched a challenge competition organized throughout the province's rural areas.

All participating farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and productive models have put forward specific and practical production increase plans and formulated various reliable methods to ensure the realization of the production increase plans. Some of the production increase targets they have proposed are 10% higher than last year's output, some are about 50% higher than last year, and some are even doubled or tripled. Some production cooperatives and mutual aid teams entered the patriotic production increase movement after overcoming the "production has reached its peak" mentality of their members and team members. For example, the He Fengshan Agricultural Production Cooperative (formerly a mutual aid team, which only became an agricultural production cooperative last year) has had yields of various crops that were one-third higher than ordinary farmland in the area for the past two years. As a result, some members developed a sense of complacency and believed that He Fengshan's goal of increasing grain production by 100 jin per mu was "impossible." Later, He Fengshan led the members to examine the shortcomings in last year's production, such as shallow plowing, insufficient fertilizer, and mixed seeds. Everyone compared last year's production conditions with this year's and realized that it was entirely possible to increase production by 100 jin per mu compared to last year. After the entire cooperative unified their thinking, they were very enthusiastic about increasing production and immediately set conditions to participate in the competition.

In order to meet the needs of carrying out the patriotic production increase competition movement, the Northeast People's Government and the people's governments of various provinces are taking urgent and effective measures to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing production. Recently, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally went to the countryside twice to inspect spring plowing. The spring plowing inspection teams dispatched by the Northeast People's Government are currently inspecting preparatory work in various places and helping various places organize farmers to participate in the competition movement. The CPC committees and people's governments of various provinces have also dispatched a large number of capable cadres to go deep into the rural areas to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing production. In order to enhance the material foundation of the competition movement, local people's governments are stepping up the distribution of agricultural loans, new farm tools, improved seeds, pesticides, and agricultural machinery through cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency message: The agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement has also been widely launched in various provinces in the Central-South region.

In Hunan Province, farmers have set a 1,000-jin rice plan (i.e., requiring 1,000 jin of rice per mu this year), and no less than 200,000 households have participated in the rice production competition. In Liling County alone, more than 20,000 farmers have set a 1,000-jin plan; in Nanxian County on the shore of Dongting Lake, 30,000 households have set a 1,000-jin plan. Hunan is known for its rice production. Since liberation, the unit area yield of rice has increased significantly, and many agricultural labor models have achieved yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Under the leadership of rice production models Li Chenggui, Lin Zigui (formerly known as Lin Zigui), Zhu Hongxiu, Tian Qifa, and Ren Guifang and other mutual aid teams, Hunan farmers are very enthusiastic and confident in participating in the rice production increase competition.

The competition movement in Henan Province has also developed rapidly. The province's famous May Xinrang mutual aid team in Yuxian County, Cheng Gao Zhao Heihaizi mutual aid team, Lushan Xin Zixiu mutual aid team, Xiangcheng Xu Bingchen mutual aid team, Xinyang Wang Shuangyin mutual aid team, and Shanzhou He Chengshun mutual aid team have all participated in competitions for overall production increase, cotton production increase, and wheat production increase. At present, more than 300 mutual aid teams in the province have participated in the competition. Ma Xinrang and several other mutual aid teams have also challenged the farmers in the province, and the farmers in the province have also responded to their challenge, forming a wave of interlocking competitions.

Nanchang County, a key production county in Jiangxi Province, will launch 10,000 mu of rice fields to participate in the 1,000-jin production competition this year. Now, this movement is unfolding around the challenge of Xiaolan Village in the county, and participation in the competition is very enthusiastic. In addition, Jiangxi's famous Chen Yike mutual aid team participated in the overall production increase competition and challenged mutual aid teams and farmers in the province. Now, many counties have also responded to the challenge of the Chen Yike mutual aid team.

Many farmers in Hubei are participating in the rice production increase competition and are launching a "100 teams and 1,000 households" rice 1,000-jin production movement. In Guangxi Province, under the leadership of labor model Jiang Zaiqiu's mutual aid team in the whole county, the production increase movement is also underway.

The people's governments of various provinces in Central-South China also attach great importance to the patriotic production increase competition movement and have strengthened their leadership. The people's governments of Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces have formulated and promulgated specific measures for carrying out the patriotic production increase competition movement, calling on farmers to actively participate in the competition. The people's governments of Henan, Hunan, and other provinces have dispatched spring plowing production inspection teams to go deep into districts and townships to inspect and universally convene farmer representative meetings (some areas have also held mutual aid team leader meetings or production activist training classes) to promote the production increase movement.

    东北中南农村展开爱国增产竞赛运动
    许多互助组参加全国的竞赛并在本地挑战形成连环竞赛
    大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动，正在东北农村中展开。截至目前为止，参加全国竞赛的农场已有黑龙江省查哈阳机械农场、克山农业试验场、通北县示范农场，辽东省熊岳农业试验场、西安县农场，热河省农业试验场承德分场和辽西省的二十三个示范农场。参加全国竞赛的农业生产合作社和互助组，有热河省杜昌、黑龙江省孟庆余、辽东省张文春、松江省张福龄、吉林省何凤山、辽西省刘洪达等劳动模范所领导的农业生产合作社和互助组。应战的丰产模范有小麦丰产模范蓝国焕、水稻丰产模范南铉廷、植棉模范宣裕民等数十名。此外，吉林省敦化县成记号屯的妇女、查哈阳农场的梁军女拖拉机队也奋起参加竞赛。这些应战的农场、合作互助组织和农民，同时在本地挑战，从而形成了地区连环竞赛的热潮。此外，黑龙江省并由全省第一个互助模范村——绥化县民吉村，向全省农村发起了一个组织起来的挑战竞赛。
    所有参加竞赛的农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和丰产模范等，都提出了具体切实的增产计划，并拟定了保证增产计划实现的各种可靠的办法。他们所提出的增产目标，有的比去年的产量提高百分之十，有的比去年提高百分之五十左右，有的甚至提高一倍至三倍。有些生产合作社和互助组是在克服社员、组员的“增产到顶”的思想后才进入爱国增产运动的。像何凤山农业生产合作社（以前是互助组，去年才变为农业生产合作社）两年来各种作物都比当地一般农田高三分之一。于是一部分社员便产生了满足现状的思想，对何凤山提出每亩地增产一百斤粮食的努力目标，认为“办不到”。后来何凤山领导社员检查出去年生产中存在着耕的浅、粪不足、种籽杂等缺点。大家又把去年生产条件和今年作了对比，才了解每亩地比去年增产一百斤完全是可能的。全社社员思想统一后，增产热情都很高，便立即订出了条件参加竞赛。
    为了适应开展爱国增产竞赛运动的需要，东北人民政府和各省人民政府，正采取紧急有效的措施，加强对春耕生产的领导。最近，东北人民政府主席高岗曾两次亲赴农村视察春耕。东北人民政府派出的春耕检查组，现正在各地检查备耕工作和帮助各地组织农民参加竞赛运动。各省中共党委和人民政府，也都派出了大批得力干部，深入农村，加强对春耕生产的领导。为了增强竞赛运动的物质基础，各地人民政府正通过合作社，加紧发放农贷、新农具、优良种籽、农药和农业器械。
    农业爱国增产竞赛的运动，也已在中南区各省广泛展开。
    湖南省农民订出水稻千斤计划（即要求今年每亩水稻产一千斤），参加水稻丰产竞赛的已不下二十万户。醴陵一县就有两万多户农民订出了千斤计划；洞庭湖畔的南县订千斤计划的有三万户。湖南以产稻米著称，解放后水稻的单位面积产量已显著提高，每亩产量达到千斤以上的农业劳动模范很多。在水稻丰产模范李承桂、林子桂（原名林紫桂）、朱鸿修、田启发和任贵芳等互助组的带头下，湖南农民参加水稻增产竞赛极踊跃，信心很高。
    河南省竞赛运动开展得也较快。该省著名的禹县马新让互助组、成皋赵黑孩互助组、鲁山辛自修互助组、襄城徐炳臣互助组、信阳王双印互助组、陕州贺成顺互助组等，都已分别参加全面增产、棉花增产、小麦增产等竞赛。目前，全省参加竞赛的互助组已有三百多个。马新让等几个互助组又向本省的农民挑战，全省农民也向他们应战，形成了连环竞赛的热潮。
    江西省生产重点县南昌县今年要发动一万亩稻田参加千斤丰产竞赛，现在，这个运动正围绕着该县小蓝村的挑战展开，参加竞赛的很踊跃。另外，江西著名的陈翊科互助组参加了全面增产的竞赛，并向省内互助组和农民挑战，现在各县向陈翊科互助组应战的也很多。
    湖北农民参加水稻增产竞赛的很多，正在开展一个百组千户水稻千斤丰产运动。广西省在全县劳动模范蒋在球互助组的带头下，增产运动也正在开展。
    中南各省人民政府对爱国增产竞赛运动也都很重视，并已加强了领导。湖南、江西等省人民政府都已经制订和颁布了开展爱国增产竞赛运动的具体办法，号召农民踊跃参加竞赛。河南、湖南等省人民政府都已派出春耕生产检查组，深入区乡检查，并普遍召开农民代表会议（有些地区还举行互助组长会议或办生产积极分子训练班），来推动增产运动。
