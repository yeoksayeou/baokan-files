The eighth issue of "Defend Peace" magazine first discusses the international situation since 1951. The president of the magazine, Pierre Cot, in his editorial "Hope for Peace," pointed out that 1951 was "a year against war." He analyzed the situations in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, Western Europe, and the United States. He said: Striving for peace is a daily struggle. If we bravely demand peace, and everyone asks every day: "What have I done for peace today? How can I do better tomorrow?" Then the war will recede. Claude Morgan's article "International Events of 1951" provides a concise and essential review of the international situation of that year. There are also two interview records, recording the opinions of Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the current international situation.

This issue uses a large amount of space to discuss the question of "miracles created by mankind." Around this theme, there is a posthumous work written by the great French scientist Paul Langevin in 1945: "Era of Mutation," pointing out that since the discovery of atomic energy, mankind has begun a new era, where the infinite power stored in atoms by nature can be handed over to people to control. But whether it is used for good or for causing trouble is entirely up to the people themselves to decide. The article "The South Moves North" introduces the achievements of the Soviet Union in transforming nature through human power. "The Project to Rebuild Warsaw" and "The People of Sichuan Love the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway" describe the achievements of peaceful labor. There are also several articles and photo reports introducing inventions and discoveries in science and medicine. It also introduces "Folk Art of South America" and "Oil Paintings of Mexico."

In 1952, four great cultural anniversaries will be held around the world, namely the 150th anniversary of Hugo's birth, the 500th anniversary of Vinci's birth, the 1000th anniversary of Avicenna's birth, and the 100th anniversary of Gogol's death. This issue publishes four articles commemorating them.

This issue also contains Ehrenburg's "Civilization or Barbarism?" which discusses American cultural policy. There is also "The Story of the Pigeon and the Crow," a Punjabi folk tale written by the great Indian writer Anand, and Alberti's poem "Song of Peace," and other works.

    介绍“保卫和平”第八期
    “保卫和平”杂志第八期，首先讨论了一九五一年以来的国际形势。社长皮尔·戈特在社论“和平的指望”里，指出了一九五一年是“反对战争的一年”。他分析了亚洲、中东、拉丁美洲、西欧和美国的形势。他说：争取和平是每天要进行的斗争。假如我们奋勇要求和平，每个人每天都问一问：“今天我为和平做了些什么？明天我将如何做得更好？”那么战争就会后退。克罗德·摩尔岗的“一九五一年国际大事”一文，对这一年的国际形势作了简明扼要的评述。另外还有两篇访问记，记录了阿拉伯联盟总书记阿查木·帕夏和印度总理尼赫鲁对当前国际形势的意见。
    本期以大量的篇幅来讨论“人类创造的奇迹”这一问题。围绕这一主题，有法国大科学家保罗·朗日万在一九四五年写的一篇遗作：“突变时代”，指出自从原子能被发现以后，人类开始了一个新的纪元，可以把自然界贮藏在原子里面无穷的力量交给人来支配。但是究竟用来造福还是用来闯祸，那就完全由人们自己来决定。“南方移向北方”一文，介绍了苏联人力改造自然的成就。“重建华沙的工程”和“四川人民热爱成渝铁路”，描述了和平劳动的业绩。另外还有几篇介绍科学与医学上的发明与发现的文章和摄影报道。还介绍了“南美洲的民间艺术”和“墨西哥的油画”。
    在一九五二年内，全世界要举行四个伟大的文化周年纪念，就是雨果诞生一百五十周年纪念，芬奇诞生五百周年纪念，阿维森纳诞生一千周年纪念和果戈理逝世一百周年纪念。本期刊载了四篇纪念他们的文章。
    本期还载有爱伦堡的“文明乎？野蛮乎？”谈到了美国的文化政策。另有印度大作家安那德写的班札布民间传说“鸽子和乌鸦的故事”、阿尔伯狄的诗“和平之歌”等作品。
