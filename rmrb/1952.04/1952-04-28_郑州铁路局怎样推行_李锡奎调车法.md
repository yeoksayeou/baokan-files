How the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Promotes the "Li Xikui Shunting Method"
	Wu Feng

    The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau began piloting the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" in three major marshalling stations, namely Zhengzhou, Chang'an, and Hankou Jiang'an, starting in November of last year. The Bureau and sub-bureaus dispatched cadres and, in conjunction with the station's core personnel, established working groups to provide specific guidance and assistance. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the promotion work once fell into a state of no leadership and no responsibility because the cadres of the working groups were drawn back to participate in the "Three-Anti" struggle, and the leadership did not pay close attention. Since late February, on the basis of the initial victory in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has strengthened the staffing of working groups and vigorously promoted the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." As of March, 25 of the 31 shunting groups in the three stations of Zhengzhou, Chang'an, and Hankou Jiang'an had implemented the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." As a result, the work efficiency of these three stations has been significantly improved. For example, comparing February of this year with December of last year: the average train marshalling time per train at Zhengzhou Station was shortened by 15 percent, the train dismantling time per train was shortened by 18 percent, and the dwell time was shortened by 32 percent; the average train marshalling time per train at Chang'an Station was shortened by 40 percent, the train dismantling time per train was shortened by 22 percent, the dwell time was shortened by 16 percent, and the turnaround time was shortened by 45 percent; Jiang'an Station's implementation was not thorough, and the results were less, but the train marshalling time and train dismantling time were also shortened by an average of 1 percent per train.

    The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's promotion of the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" went through two stages: clearing up thinking and establishing systems. In order to expose and overcome various ideological obstacles, station workers were first widely organized to study. Through study, it was revealed that many workers had a poor understanding of the Li Xikui shunting method, generally had conservative ideas, and therefore generated resistance. For example, Zhengzhou Station emphasized poor personnel quality and equipment conditions, making it unworkable; some conservatively believed that "canceling the card system would make it impossible to grasp the scene"; individual backward shunters believed that "canceling the shunting operation notice increased the trouble for shunters and was mentally taxing"; and some switchmen held a bystander attitude of "minding their own business." In response to these conservative and resistant emotions, the working group and station leaders adopted methods such as mobilizing at large meetings, discussing in small meetings, visiting families, educating through the Party and the Communist Youth League, and individually persuading, repeatedly educating to clear up thinking. It was made clear that promoting the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" was not to strengthen labor intensity or extend working hours, but to release the shunting workers from the shackles of the long-term ruling operating system, so that workers could be liberated ideologically and institutionally, in order to improve labor productivity. At the same time, the advanced working methods of the Li Xikui shunting group were used to educate them to recognize the pain of not dividing labor; the method of carefully calculating accounts was used to break their idea of emphasizing poor equipment; and the examples of continuous shunting and coordinated cooperation were used to change the switchmen's view of "minding their own business." After this arduous, meticulous, and in-depth ideological education process, a unified understanding was reached among the workers doing shunting work, and the steps for promotion were set. For example, Chang'an Station, after seven days of discussion, the workers themselves criticized the initial idea that "there are few tracks, and marshalling and dismantling are done by two shunting groups, so it is impossible to fix lines and implement a line-based system."

    After basically overcoming the above-mentioned ideological obstacles, the workers' understanding improved, their enthusiasm was high, and according to Li Xikui's advanced experience, combined with specific circumstances, they began to establish various systems and gradually implement them. Zhengzhou Station stipulated three steps to implement: first, fix the use of lines, strictly receive and dispatch trains on the "arrival and departure lines," and divide the shunting groups into line-based assignments. Second, implement chalk symbol marking, establish a contact system, a handover system, a three-check-three-call system, and a review meeting system. Third, improve the leadership of shunting operations, and establish a station dispatcher to uniformly lead station technical operations. Because of the thorough explanation, practice, follow-up work, and personnel adjustments, and the maturity among the masses, the implementation was better after the official start, and the work efficiency was quickly improved. Chang'an Station and Jiang'an Station also established various systems and gradually implemented the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" according to the specific circumstances, respectively, to improve work efficiency.

    In the process of implementing the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," these three stations also saw the emergence of many good shunting groups. For example, the Liu Chuanshun shunting group at Zhengzhou Station was like an organized combat unit. As soon as they came to work, they held a small group mobilization meeting to explain the tasks of the shift; before starting work, they promptly conveyed and deployed the tasks to the driver and the switchman; and during the operation, they seized the short free time to hold review meetings, and also created a set of reporting systems to summarize and record every day. Therefore, they could understand the amount and progress of the group's work at any time. They also took the initiative to help switchmen wipe switches and visit drivers' families, which greatly moved the drivers; thus, they further strengthened unity, consolidated joint labor, and improved work efficiency. Another example is the Song Guangyi shunting group, although they suffered countless cold remarks from backward elements, under the support and education of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the administration, they always worked hard to learn and work hard to do everything systematically, even the handover was done according to regulations, queuing up and saluting. Song Guangyi said to everyone: "We would rather marshal one less train than hand over haphazardly, adding trouble to the next shift." This fully reflects the working class's organization, overall concept, and collectivist spirit. Another example is the Zheng Fuxing shunting group at Chang'an Station, who came up with a method in which the shunter, the front hook coupler, and the third hook coupler stand in a triangular position when shunting on a curved track, overcoming the difficulty of transmitting signals on a curved track. These excellent shunting groups have played a positive role in driving other shunting groups to implement the "Li Xikui Shunting Method."

    The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's promotion of the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" fully illustrates that the process of promoting advanced working methods is the process of new ideas and new systems fighting against old ideas and old systems and gradually achieving victory. Therefore, this cannot be simply regarded as a technical reform, but ideological mobilization work must be carried out at all times; otherwise, the result of the promotion will be either half-new or formalism. Zhengzhou Station was equipped with political work cadres at the beginning of the promotion of advanced working methods, and ideological work was done in the process of promotion, plus the improvement of workers' awareness after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, so the foundation was relatively solid and the results were greater. Jiang'an Station neglected ideological education work and did not lay the foundation for promoting advanced working methods, so the promotion work became formalism, very incomplete, and the results were not significant.

    At present, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has summarized the experience of promoting the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" in the past period, and is further organizing each station to widely and deeply promote this shunting method according to the different work foundations and the degree of ideological mobilization of each station.

    郑州铁路局怎样推行“李锡奎调车法”
    吴风
    郑州铁路管理局从去年十一月起开始在郑州、长安、汉口江岸等三个主要编组站试行“李锡奎调车法”。管理局和分局都派出了干部，结合车站的骨干分子，成立了工作组，具体地指导和帮助。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，由于工作组干部被抽回参加“三反”斗争，领导方面抓得也不紧，推行工作曾经一度陷于无人领导、无人负责的状态。二月下旬以后，在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争初步胜利的基础上，郑州铁路管理局再度加强工作组干部配备，大力推广“李锡奎调车法”。到三月份为止，郑州、长安、汉口江岸三个车站的三十一个调车组中，已有二十五个调车组实行了“李锡奎调车法”。因此，这三个车站的工作效率已显著提高。如以今年二月份和去年十二月份相比较：郑州车站列车编组时间每列平均缩短了百分之十五，列车解体时间每列平均缩短了百分之十八，停留时间缩短了百分之三十二；长安车站列车编组时间每列平均缩短了百分之四十，列车解体时间每列平均缩短了百分之二十二，停留时间缩短了百分之十六，中转时间缩短了百分之四十五；江岸车站实行得不彻底，成绩较少，但列车编组时间和列车解体时间每列车平均也都缩短了百分之一。
    郑州铁路管理局推行“李锡奎调车法”，经过了打通思想和建立制度两个阶段。为了揭发并克服各种思想障碍，首先广泛组织车站职工进行了学习。通过学习，暴露出许多职工对李锡奎调车法的认识很差，一般都有保守思想以及因此而产生的抵触情绪。如郑州车站有的强调人员质量和设备条件差，行不通；有的保守地认为“取消卡片就没法掌握现场”；个别落后的调车员认为“取消调车作业通知书，增加了调车员的麻烦，费脑子”；而一些搬道员则抱着“事不关己高高挂起”的旁观态度。针对这些保守和抵触情绪，工作组和车站领导方面采取了大会动员、小会讨论、家庭访问、党和青年团进行教育和个别规劝等办法，反复教育，打通思想。明确指出：推行“李锡奎调车法”，并不是加强劳动强度、延长劳动时间，而是解除调车工作人员长期所受统治作业制度的束缚，使职工从思想上制度上获得解放，以提高劳动生产率。同时又用李锡奎调车组的先进工作方法，来教育他们认识到不分工的苦恼；用算细账的办法，打破了他们强调设备差的想法；用连续溜放和联系配合的事例，改变了搬道员“事不关己高高挂起”的看法。经过这些艰苦、细致、深入的思想教育过程，才在做调车工作的职工中统一了认识，定下了推行的步骤。如长安车站，经过七天讨论，职工们也自行批判了开始时认为“股道少，编组解体又是两组调车组合做，无法固定线路和实行包线制”的思想。
    在基本上克服了上述思想障碍后，职工认识提高，情绪高涨，根据李锡奎的先进经验，结合具体情况，着手建立各种制度，逐步贯彻实行。郑州车站规定了三个步骤来实行：先固定线路使用，严格地在“到发线”接车发车，并且把各调车组分工包线。其次，实行粉笔符号标记，建立联系制度、交接班制度、三检三喊制度以及检讨会制度。再次，健全调车作业的领导，成立车站调度员统一领导车站技术作业。由于经过充分的讲解、实习、跟班工作及调整人员，并在群众中酝酿成熟，因此在正式开始实行以后贯彻得较好，工作效率很快提高了。长安车站和江岸车站也都根据具体情况，分别先后步骤，建立各项制度，逐步实行了“李锡奎调车法”，使工作效率提高。
    在实行“李锡奎调车法”的过程中，这三个车站也曾经出现了不少较好的调车组。如郑州车站刘传顺调车组，就像个有组织的作战部队，一上班就开小组动员会，讲明本班任务；开始工作前，及时把任务传达布置给司机和搬道员；在作业中又抓紧短短的空闲时间开检讨会，还创造了一套汇报制度，每天总结、记录。因此，能够随时了解本组的工作数量和进度。他们又主动帮助搬道员擦道岔，访问司机家属，使司机大受感动；于是进一步加强了团结，巩固了联合劳动，提高了工作效率。又如宋光义调车组，虽然受了无数落后分子的冷嘲热讽，但在党、青年团、行政各方面的支持和教育下，始终努力学、努力做，一切制度化，连交接班也按规定排队敬礼。宋光义向大家说：“咱宁可少编一列车，也不能乱交接，给下一班人员增加麻烦。”这都充分体现了工人阶级的组织性、整体观念和集体主义精神。再如长安车站郑辅兴调车组，想出了在弯道调车作业时调车员、头钩连结员、三钩连结员站成三角地位的办法，克服了弯道传递信号的困难。这些优秀的调车组对于带动其他调车组实行“李锡奎调车法”都起了积极的作用。
    郑州铁路管理局推行“李锡奎调车法”的情况，充分说明了推行先进工作方法的过程，就是新的思想新的制度和旧的思想旧的制度作斗争并逐步取得胜利的过程。因此，不能单纯把这看作是技术性的改革，而必须始终贯彻思想动员工作；否则推行的结果，不是半新不旧，就是形式主义。郑州车站在推行先进工作方法的开始就配备了政治工作干部，并在推行过程中做了思想工作，加上在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后职工觉悟的提高，因此基础较稳，成绩较大。江岸车站忽视了思想教育工作，没有打下推行先进工作法的基础，推行工作就流于形式主义，很不彻底，成绩不显著。
    目前郑州铁路管理局已经总结了过去一段时期推行“李锡奎调车法”的经验，并正根据各站不同的工作基础和思想发动程度，进一步组织各站广泛深入地推行这个调车法。
