Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: Li Peilin, a Chinese pathology expert working on anti-bacterial warfare in Shenyang, a member of the British Pathological Society, and the current director of the Pathology Department of the China Medical University, and Wu Zaidong, a member of the British Pathological Society and the current professor of the Pathology Department of Nanjing University, jointly wrote a letter to Joseph Needham, President of the Sino-British Friendship Association and a member of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom, calling on the British scientific community to jointly stop the crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out germ warfare. The original letter is as follows: Mr. Joseph Needham, President of the Sino-British Friendship Association and Member of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom:

	During China's War of Resistance Against Japan, you came to China with the friendly spirit of the British people and gave much encouragement and help to Chinese scientific workers who were engaged in research work in difficult circumstances at that time. We still have a deep impression of this.

	Recently, we read in the newspapers a statement issued by you on behalf of the Sino-British Friendship Association, protesting against the crimes of the U.S. invading army in carrying out germ warfare in Korea and China. We are very happy because what you are calling for, "preventing the United States from bringing disaster to the world," represents the voices of peace-loving people all over the world.

	We now live in Shenyang and are eyewitnesses to the U.S. conducting germ warfare in Northeast China. We want to report to you the confirmed fact that the U.S. Air Force spread insects containing bacteria in Shenyang: A large number of living insects, a total of more than 20 species, mostly flies and locusts, were found not far from our residence, in the building of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government and its adjacent areas on the evening of March 15 (just as the ice and snow were beginning to melt). Professor Chen Shixiang, a Chinese entomologist, identified them as: "This locust is scientifically named Locusta Migra-toria. In Shenyang, this insect usually dies in late autumn or early winter after laying eggs, and the eggs do not hatch until May or June of the following year." Based on the growth conditions of this insect, he verified that "it is absolutely impossible for locusts to grow locally in the cold days of mid-March in Northeast China." According to Professor Lu Baolin's identification, the flies found in the area are sarcophagid flies. These flies can only survive in warm areas. He believes that it is also an abnormal phenomenon to find a large number of these flies outdoors at this time and place. Our colleague, Professor Jing Guanhua, tested the flies he caught and found that they carried typhoid bacilli.

	Yesterday, we also saw with our own eyes the warhead bodies of three U.S. germ bombs sent to Shenyang from Changbai County, Liaodong Province. These three bombs were dropped by U.S. military aircraft at 9:35 p.m. on March 26 in Daweizitun and Gushanzi Village, Jiazaishui Village, District 4 of the county. These germ bombs are exactly the same as those dropped by U.S. aircraft in Korea. In addition to the obvious U.S. markings, the shell is marked with the word EMPTY; but according to the person who picked up the shell, flies, fleas, beetles and other germ-carrying insects were found near the bomb. This shows how insidious and cunning U.S. imperialism is in carrying out germ warfare.

	We also want to report to you one thing: we participated in the sacred work of anti-bacterial warfare, and from the bodies of our compatriots who died of infection, we discovered an encephalitis that had never existed in China. This happened after U.S. aircraft attacked the vicinity of Anshan on March 2. U.S. aircraft dropped a large number of virus-carrying mosquitoes there, and two residents named Zhang Chengfu and Li Zhibin died of encephalitis as a result. Our colleague Professor Jing Guanhua also conducted animal inoculation experiments with mosquitoes taken from the area, and the inoculated mice died immediately. What we saw in the autopsy was that the damage to the brain tissue of the mice was very similar to that of the two deceased.

	It is impossible for us to report to you every fact we have seen and heard, which would require considerable space. You will see the "Report on the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by U.S. Troops on Chinese Territory" published by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigating Group, which is a very detailed and fair report.

	We remember when you gave a lecture at Northwest University in 1943, you said on the way in the car with us that "the friendship of the people is eternal," and we deeply know the meaning of this sentence. Therefore, this is also the motive that prompted us to write this letter. When this letter reaches your hands and is announced to the people of your country through you, we firmly believe that they will surely stand together with the Chinese people and the people of the world to oppose the crime of the U.S. aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

	We know that every scientific discovery is for the benefit of mankind. Therefore, we cannot allow scientific achievements to be used by U.S. warmongers as tools to slaughter people. You are a famous scientist, and we have always admired your righteous views. We believe that there are many upright scientists in the United Kingdom who will surely join you in protesting against the crimes of U.S. imperialism in violating humanitarianism, undermining international law, and carrying out germ warfare, in order to safeguard the dignity of science and promote science to benefit mankind.

	Li Peilin
	Wu Zaidong
	April 11, 1952, in Shenyang.

    李佩琳等致函英中友协会长李约瑟
    呼吁英国科学界共同制止美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】在沈阳参加反细菌战工作的我国病理学专家、英国病理学会会员、现任中国医科大学病理学系主任李佩琳和英国病理学会会员、现任南京大学病理学系教授吴在东，联名写信给英中友好协会会长、英国皇家科学会会员李约瑟，呼吁英国科学界共起制止美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。原信如下：英中友好协会会长、英国皇家科学会会员李约瑟先生：
    在我国抗日战争时期，你曾带着英国人民的友好精神来到中国，对于当时在困难环境下从事研究工作的中国科学工作者，给予了许多鼓励和帮助，我们至今还有着深刻的印象。
    最近，在报端读到你代表英中友好协会发表的声明，抗议美国侵略军队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行，我们万分高兴。因为你们所呼吁的“防止美国给世界招来灾难”，正是代表了全世界爱好和平人民的呼声。
    我们现在居住在沈阳，是美国在我国东北地区进行细菌战的目击者。我们要向你报告一件美国空军在沈阳撒布含有细菌的昆虫的确凿事实：在离我们住处不远的地方，东北人民政府贸易部所在地的大楼及其邻近地区，在三月十五日晚上（正是冰雪初融的时候），发现了大批活着的昆虫，共有二十多种，其中以苍蝇和蝗虫为最多。经我国昆虫学家陈世骧教授检定：“这种蝗虫学名为Locusta    Migra-toria。在沈阳，此种昆虫通常在产卵后于秋末或冬初死去，虫卵要到次年五、六月方才孵化。”他根据这种昆虫的生长条件考证：“在东北三月中旬的寒冷的日子里，蝗虫是绝不可能在本地生长的。”又据陆宝麟教授检定：该地发现的苍蝇是大家蝇。这种苍蝇只能生存于温暖地区。他认为此时此地，这种苍蝇在户外大量发现也是一种反常的现象。我们的同事景冠华教授从捕到的苍蝇的身上，检验出来带有伤寒菌。
    昨天，我们又亲眼看到了从辽东省长白县送到沈阳的三个美国细菌炸弹的弹体。这三颗炸弹是三月二十六日下午九时三十五分，美国军用飞机在该县四区佳在水村大崴子屯和孤山子屯投下的。这种细菌炸弹和美机在朝鲜所投掷的完全相同。弹壳上除有显明的美国标志外，并注有EMPTY（空弹）的字样；但据拾到弹壳的人说：在炸弹的附近，发现了苍蝇、跳蚤、甲虫等带菌毒虫。由此可见，美帝国主义进行细菌战是这样地阴险而狡诈。
    我们还要报告你一件事：我们参加了反细菌战的神圣工作，从解剖因染疫而死亡的我国同胞的尸体上，发现了我国从未有过的一种脑炎。这是在三月二日美机侵袭鞍山附近之后所发生的事情。美机在那里投掷了大量带病毒的蚊虫，有两位名叫张成福、李志宾的居民因此染疫患脑炎症死去。我们的同事景冠华教授同时将该地取来的蚊虫作动物接种实验后，被接种的小白鼠随即死去。我们解剖所见，小白鼠的脑组织损坏的情形和上述两位死者的情形极相类似。
    我们不可能把亲眼所见和听到的每一事实，一一报告给你，这需要相当的篇幅。你会看到国际民主法律工作者协会调查团所发表的“关于美国军队在中国领土上使用细菌武器的报告”，那是一篇非常详细的、公正的报告。
    我们记得一九四三年你去西北大学演讲时，在和我们同车的路上，你曾说“人民的友情是永远的”，我们深知这句话的意义。因此，这也是引起我们写这封信的动机。当这封信到达你的手中，并通过你向贵国人民宣布的时候，我们深信：他们必定会和中国人民以及全世界人民在一起，反对美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    我们知道：每一项科学上的发现，都是为了造福人类。因此，我们不能允许科学成果被美国战争贩子们利用作为屠杀人民的工具。你是著名的科学家，你的正义的主张，我们素来是很钦佩的。我们相信：英国还有许多正直的科学家，他们一定也会和你一样，一同起来，抗议美帝国主义违反人道、破坏国际公法、进行细菌战的罪行，以维护科学的尊严，促使科学去为人类造福。
