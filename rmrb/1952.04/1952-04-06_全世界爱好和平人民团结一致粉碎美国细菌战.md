    Worldwide Peace-Loving People Unite to Crush American Germ Warfare
    Cai Tingkai, Member of the World Peace Council
    I am a former soldier who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan. I have extreme hatred for the past crimes of Japanese imperialism in spreading bacteria on Chinese soil. But now, the American aggressors are imitating the practices of Japanese fascist war criminals and using this inhuman weapon of murder on an even larger scale in Korea and Northeast China! I think that any ordinary soldier, the people of any country, should unanimously condemn and oppose this criminal act of the American aggressors. They have violated the Hague Convention of 1907 regarding the rules of land warfare, and also violated the Geneva Protocol of 1925 concerning the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons. In the various declarations and resolutions of the World Peace Congress, the use of bacteriological weapons is considered impermissible by universal moral standards.
    As a member of the World Peace Council, I have participated in the peace conferences and council meetings held in Warsaw, Berlin, Vienna and other places. At these meetings, I have had earnest discussions with peace-loving people from all over the world, including soldiers from the Americas and Europe who participated in the anti-fascist war, on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic bombs, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. On behalf of the peace-loving people of the world, we suggested in the "Second World Peace Congress to the United Nations" that the United Nations unconditionally prohibit the use of all kinds of weapons for the large-scale destruction of mankind, and declare the government that first uses such weapons to be war criminals.
    The peace-loving people of the world have always resolutely opposed the use of various destructive weapons. Since the beginning of human history, people have been fighting against poisonous substances that harm mankind with their intelligence, science and culture. However, the American aggressors are now disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, and disregarding human justice and conscience, and are spreading bacteria on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China. The evidence of the crimes of the American aggressors has been made public to the people of the world. The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Peace Council recently held in Oslo unanimously adopted the "Appeal to the Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" and other resolutions to safeguard world peace. We, the Chinese people, resolutely support the call of the World Peace Council and unite with the peace-loving people of the world to stop the evil deeds of the American aggressors.

    全世界爱好和平人民团结一致粉碎美国细菌战
    世界和平理事会理事　蔡廷锴
    我曾是一个参加过抗日战争的军人，我对过去日本帝国主义在中国土地上散布细菌的罪行是极端憎恨的。但是，美国侵略者现在却仿照日本法西斯战犯的作法，更大规模地在朝鲜和中国东北使用这种灭绝人性的杀人武器了！我想，任何一个普通的军人，任何国家的人民，对美国侵略者这种犯罪行为，都应该一致声讨和反对。他们违反了一九○七年海牙公约所规定的陆战法规，也违反了一九二五年日内瓦议定书中关于禁止使用细菌武器的法律。在世界和平大会的历次宣言和决议中，对使用细菌武器，更认为是普遍的道德标准所不容许的。
    我曾以世界和平大会理事会理事的资格，参加过在华沙、柏林、维也纳等地召开的和平大会和理事会。在这些会议上，我曾和世界各国爱好和平的人士，包括美洲和欧洲一些参加过反法西斯战争的军人，在一起热切地讨论过裁减军备和禁止使用原子弹、细菌武器等各种毁灭性武器的问题。我们曾代表全世界爱好和平人民的意志，在“二届世界和大致联合国书”中，建议联合国无条件禁止使用各种大规模毁灭人类的武器，并宣布首先使用这种武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    全世界爱好和平的人民历来都是坚决反对使用各种毁灭性武器的。人类自有历史以来，都是以自己的智力、科学与文化来和为害人类的毒物作斗争的。但是，美国侵略者现在竟不顾全世界人民的反对，不顾人类的正义和良心，在朝鲜和中国东北大规模地散布细菌。美国侵略者的罪证已被公布在全世界人民面前。最近在奥斯陆举行的世界和平理事会执行局会议，一致通过了题为“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书及其他维护世界和平的决议。我们中国人民坚决拥护世界和平理事会的号召，和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致来制止美国侵略者的罪恶行为。
