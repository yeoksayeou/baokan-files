    Manager of the Zhumadian City Trade Branch in Henan Province
    Disregards Instructions from Higher Authorities, Causing Serious Losses to State Assets

    To the Editor: Yang Jianmin, the manager of the Zhumadian City Trade Branch in Henan Province, is irresponsible in his work and refuses to accept instructions from higher-level government, resulting in significant losses to state property. The total storage capacity of all warehouses of the branch company is approximately 1.5 million jin of materials, but due to the irresponsible work of the company's leadership, there is a lack of planning for the storage of materials. As a result, only 250,000 jin of materials are stored in the warehouses, while large quantities of other materials are stored outdoors, exposed to rain and snow. According to statistics, 110,000 jin of white hemp, 500 jin of sesame, and 3,400 packs of Gongnong brand matches have been soaked by rainwater. Additionally, 45,000 jin of sesame cakes, over 1,900 jin of time ash paper, over 3,500 jin of dianzhang paper, and 1,000 jin of soybeans have become moldy and deteriorated due to rain and snow erosion. The total loss amounts to 406 million yuan.

    In late March this year, the Xinyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office warehouse inspection team sent personnel to inspect the branch company and discovered serious mold and spoilage of the stored materials. They immediately raised concerns with the branch company, requesting prompt ventilation and sun-drying, and the assignment of dedicated personnel to handle the matter. However, Manager Yang Jianmin did not pay attention to this matter. After learning about this situation, the provincial company immediately ordered the branch company to carry out sun-drying, but Yang Jianmin still ignored it. On March 30th, the Xinyang branch company specifically convened an emergency meeting of branch company managers to arrange for the management of materials. Yang Jianmin still did not attach importance to this meeting and only sent a section chief to attend. He still did not urge the implementation of sun-drying work, resulting in continued expansion of losses. In order to save the loss of materials, the provincial company sent people to inspect again and reiterated their opinions to Yang Jianmin, but Yang Jianmin refused to accept the opinions, claiming objective difficulties. Yang Jianmin's irresponsibility in the management of state property and refusal to accept instructions from higher authorities, leading to serious losses of state property, is intolerable. It is recommended that relevant departments immediately conduct an inspection and deal with the matter.

### 河南省驻马店市贸易支公司经理  不接受上级指示使国家资财遭受严重损失

    河南省驻马店市贸易支公司经理
    不接受上级指示使国家资财遭受严重损失
    编辑同志：河南省驻马店市贸易支公司经理杨建民，在工作中不负责任，拒绝接受上级政府的指示，致使国家财产受到巨大损失。该支公司所有仓库总共可容物资约一百五十万斤，但因公司领导干部工作不负责任，对存放物资缺乏计划性，结果存放到库内的物资只有二十五万斤，其他大批物资都是露天存放，遭受雨雪浸蚀。据统计，白麻十一万斤、芝麻五百斤、工农牌火柴三千四百包，都已受雨水浸湿。另有麻饼四万五千斤、时灰纸一千九百多斤、点张纸三千五百多斤、黄豆一千斤，已因受雨雪侵蚀而霉烂变质。以上总共损失了四亿零六百多万元。
    今年三月下旬，信阳专署仓库检查组派人到该支公司检查，发现存放的物资有严重的霉烂现象，当即向该支公司提出意见，请迅速通风翻晒，并抽出专人负责处理此事。但经理杨建民对此事并没有予以注意。省公司了解这一情况后，马上饬令该支公司翻晒，杨建民仍置之不理。到三月三十日，信阳分公司特为此事召开了一次支公司经理紧急会议，布置物资保管工作。杨建民对这一会议仍不重视，只派了个股长去参加。他仍旧没有督促进行翻晒工作，致使损失继续扩大。省公司为了挽救物资损失，又派人来检查，并向杨建民再度提出意见，杨建民竟推说有客观困难，拒绝接受意见。杨建民对国家财产保管工作不负责任，不接受上级指示，以致造成国家财产严重的损失，这是令人不能容忍的，建议有关部门立刻进行检查处理。
