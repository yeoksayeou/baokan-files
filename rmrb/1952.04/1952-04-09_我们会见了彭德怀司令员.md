    We Met Commander Peng Dehuai
    Ba Jin
    On the morning of March 22nd, we met Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    It had started to snow outside, but it was very warm inside the cave. This was a not-so-large reception room. Under the low stone ceiling on the side near the door hung two bare electric light bulbs. Under the lights was a simple table with a few glass cups on it. Four simple chairs were placed in front of the table, and behind the chairs were more than a dozen white wooden benches.

    We seventeen literary and art workers who had come from the motherland sat on the benches, our hearts filled with excitement, our eyes full of anticipation fixed on the dimly lit passageway outside the door. We waited for a quarter of an hour, waiting for such a man who did not want others to mention his name too much, but who was respected by people all over the world as a great peace fighter. Mothers all over the world were grateful to him because he had saved the mothers and children of Korea. The people of China were all willing to say a word of thanks to him because he was protecting the peaceful lives of the motherland's mothers and children. Considering his contribution to world peace and his merits in defending the motherland, we appeared too insignificant in front of him. So, when we heard footsteps approaching, a feeling of awe that made us afraid to approach him suddenly made us tense.

    He came in, but our attentive eyes did not see clearly how he entered. In a simple military uniform, with the plain face of a worker, he appeared tall and young as he stood before us. He gave us a military salute, looked at us with kind eyes, and said with a smile, "You are all armed!" In that instant, the distance between him and us suddenly shortened and disappeared.

    We shook his hand warmly. He took a chair and sat down beside the table, and we also sat down on the benches. He grasped the back of the chair with his left hand and pressed on the edge of the table with his right hand, and began to talk to us calmly as if he were talking to relatives in a harmonious family. He began by saying, "The Korean people are a respectable and excellent nation. They are brave, hardworking, and able to endure hardship. Before we came to Korea, we did not understand this deeply enough. They have been exploited by Japanese imperialism for decades, and now they are encountering such brutal enemies as American imperialism. They have already fulfilled their responsibility in the battle to defend world peace."

    From the Korean people, he went on to talk about the American invading army, saying, "In the past, we were used to seeing the atrocities of Japanese soldiers, but the cruelty and ferocity of the American army only surpassed those of the Japanese soldiers. That is why the Korean people universally hate the American invading army. Now the American invaders actually disregard everything and use germ weapons and poison gas weapons. Soviet scientists say: Our scientists use various methods to eliminate plague and eliminate harmful bacteria; the American invaders are spreading germs everywhere, which is truly a loss of humanity. Our soldiers say: We are not afraid of airplanes and artillery, how can we be scared by these mosquitoes and flies!"

    His bright eyes shot out a kind of piercing light. We could see that his hatred for the American imperialists was as deep as his love for the Korean people. He became a little excited, took off his military cap and put it on the table, revealing some very short white hair on his head. These white hairs reminded us of his age and his many glorious achievements in the past. We looked at him more attentively, as if we wanted to absorb everything about him into our eyes. Most of the comrades did not take notes, and the comrades in the art group also forgot to use their paintbrushes, because they did not want to distract their attention.

    He picked up his hat again and put it on his head, touched his mouth with his right hand, and then put his hand on his knee and continued to talk. In a concerned tone, using concrete examples, he talked about the relationship between resisting America and aiding Korea and the motherland; about the justice of resisting America and aiding Korea and the experience of fighting against the American invading army; about the reasons for the victories in several battles; analyzed the contradictions within the imperialist camp and the contradictions within the American ruling class; and then talked about the future of the Korean armistice negotiations. We remembered his words: "Our strategist Sun Tzu said it well, 'Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.' On the contrary, the enemy has never been able to figure us out. The enemy is willing to negotiate with us because we have beaten them hard. In the middle of the negotiations, they were still unwilling and launched the autumn offensive, but they still suffered losses, with 120,000 casualties, before they started talking again. Now the enemy is in a dilemma: if they want to fight, they cannot get victory and there is no way out; if they want peace, the super-profits of the big capitalists will be gone, and an economic crisis will also come. We are different, we were originally willing to make peace, we came to fight for peace; we are not afraid to fight, we are getting stronger and stronger!"

    Listening to his simple, detailed, and repeated explanations, and looking at his kind, resolute, and firm expression, I felt a surge of heat running through my whole body. His simple words revealed his love for the nation and the motherland. His sincere expression flashed with confidence in victory. He talked tirelessly, and the more he talked, the more obvious all this became; the more he talked, the warmer and more confident we felt. My whole heart was drawn to his words, I forgot everything around me, I forgot the time of day,... I only saw this one person in front of me, he was calm, serene, and his attitude was so firm. He suddenly let out a happy laugh, and at that moment I felt that he was the embodiment of victory. We could really entrust everything to him with peace of mind, even our own lives. I believe other comrades felt the same way.

    Our expression of respect must have been seen by him, so he went on to say: "The main thing in combat is to rely on soldiers. Since ancient times, strong soldiers have been the most important thing. A strong general is just a commander whose interests are consistent with those of the soldiers. The commander is like the conductor of an orchestra. It is not enough to have a good orchestra without a good conductor; but it is not enough to have a good conductor without a good orchestra. If an individual cannot represent the interests of the vast majority of the masses, he is very insignificant."

    Time passed imperceptibly, and he continued to talk calmly. He talked about military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. He talked to us vividly, deeply, and specifically for three hours. He finally took his left hand off the back of the chair, straightened his back, and ended his talk. At this point, we breathed a sigh of relief and noticed that time had passed too quickly. Then he heard the deputy commander say the word "welcome" at the end of his speech to us. He interjected, "Although I didn't say welcome, I welcome you in my heart!" These words moved our hearts more than thousands of words. What words can we use to express our excited mood?

    Director Gan of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army said to us in the conversation: "Commander Peng's words contain very deep feelings!" Director Gan also said: "Everyone has feelings, and the hearts of soldiers are even more enthusiastic and great. Some soldiers carry explosives and destroy themselves and enemy tanks together. They are not simple, they have deep feelings. Sacrificing oneself is not easy, we should not let such feelings be buried, we have a responsibility to praise them and let the people of the motherland know." Director Gan is a person who likes to laugh, but at this time his voice trembled badly, he was very excited, and he also had deep feelings. I was so excited that I couldn't say a word. We literary and art workers are also people with feelings. After coming into contact with such a great mind, can we not surrender everything we have?

    In the evening, we came out of the cave, and the snow was falling even harder. The car took us back to the foot of the mountain where our dormitory was located. We climbed the mountain in the snow and managed to reach the entrance of the dormitory cave. At this time, snowflakes filled the sky, and the cold air hit our faces. I lowered my head and looked at the mountain, and all I could see was a white expanse of snow, with no lights showing from any houses. The night was not deep, Beijing time was only about nine o'clock. In the cities of the motherland, it should be a time of bright lights in every home, children sleeping peacefully in their beds, mothers working quietly under the lights, and people who had worked hard all day resting sweetly. Who is protecting their peaceful lives in this remote and cold land? The children of the motherland know it, the mothers of the motherland know it, and the people of China all know it.

    The smiling faces in the dreams of the children of the motherland, the satisfied expressions on the faces of the mothers, and the happy smiles of the people of the whole country are expressions of gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and their commander, General Peng Dehuai.

    我们会见了彭德怀司令员
    巴金
    我们在三月二十二日上午会见了中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员。
    外面开始在飘雪，洞子里非常暖和。这是一间并不太大的会客室，在靠门的一边的低矮的石顶盖下悬着两盏没有灯罩的电灯，灯下放了一张简单的桌子，桌上有几个玻璃杯，四把简单的椅子放在桌子前面，椅子后面有十多根白木板凳。
    我们十七个从祖国来的文艺工作者坐在板凳上，怀着兴奋的心情，用期待的眼光望着门外半昏半暗的甬道。我们等待了一刻钟，我们等待着这样的一个人，他不愿意别人多提他的名字，可是全世界的人民都尊敬他为一个伟大的和平战士。全世界的母亲都感谢他，因为他救了朝鲜的母亲和孩子。全中国的人民都愿意到他面前说一句感谢的话，因为他保护着祖国的母亲和孩子们的和平生活。拿他对世界和平的贡献来说，拿他的保卫祖国的功勋来说，我们在他面前实在显得太渺小了。所以在听见脚步声逼近的时候，一种不敢接近他的敬畏的感觉，使我们突然紧张起来。
    他进来了，我们的注意的眼睛并没有看清楚他是怎样进来的。一身简单的军服，一张朴实的工人的脸，他站在我们面前显得很高大和年轻。他给我们行了一个军礼，用和善的眼光望着我们微笑着说：“你们都武装起来了！”就在这一瞬间，他跟我们中间的距离忽然缩短了消逝了。
    我们亲切地跟他握了手，他端了一把椅子在桌子旁边坐下来，我们也在板凳上坐下了。他拿左手抓住椅背，右手按住桌沿，像和睦家庭中的亲人谈话似地对我们从容地谈起来。他开头就说：“朝鲜人是个可尊敬的优秀的民族，他们勇敢勤劳，吃苦耐劳。我们来朝鲜以前，对这一层了解得还不够深刻。他们被日本帝国主义压榨了几十年，现在又遇着像美帝国主义这样残暴的敌人。他们在保卫世界和平的战斗中已经尽了他们的责任。”
    从朝鲜人民他又谈到美国的侵略军，他说：“过去我们看惯了日本兵的暴行，美国军队的残忍凶狠只有超过日本兵。所以朝鲜人是那样普遍地仇恨美国侵略军。现在美国侵略者居然不顾一切用起细菌武器和毒瓦斯武器来了。苏联科学家说：我们科学家用种种方法要扑灭鼠疫，消灭害人的细菌；美国侵略者反而在各处散布病菌，这真是丧失了人性。我们的战士说：我们连飞机大炮都不怕，还会让这些蚊子、苍蝇吓倒！”
    他的明亮的眼睛射出一种逼人的光，我们看出来他对美帝国主义者的憎恨跟他对朝鲜人民的热爱是一样的深。他有点激动了，揭下军帽放在桌子上，露出了头上的一些很短的白发。这些白发使我们记起他的年纪，记起他过去那许多光辉的战绩。我们更注意地望着他，好像要把他的一切都吸收进我们的眼底。大部分的同志都不记笔记了，美术组的同志也忘了使用他们的画笔，为的是不愿意分散他们的注意力。
    他又抓起帽子戴在头上，拿右手摸了摸嘴，然后把手放在膝上继续谈起来。他用关切的口气，用具体的例子谈到抗美援朝对祖国的关系；谈到抗美援朝的正义性和对美国侵略军作战的经验；谈到几次战役胜利的原因；分析帝国主义阵营中间的矛盾和美国统治阶级中间的矛盾；然后又谈到朝鲜停战谈判的前途。我们记牢了他的这样的话：“我们的兵法家孙子说得好，‘知己知彼，百战百胜’，相反地敌人始终对我们摸不清楚。敌人愿意跟我们谈判，是因为我们把他们打痛了。在谈判中间他们还不甘心，又发动秋季攻势，结果还是吃了亏，伤亡十二万人，才又谈起来。现在敌人是进退两难：要打，他们得不到胜利，没有出路；要和，大资本家的暴利又没有了，经济危机也要来了。我们却不然，和本来我们愿意的，我们就是为了和平才来作战的；战我们也不怕，我们是越打越强！”
    听着他的浅明的详细的反复的解说，望着他那慈祥中带刚毅和坚定的表情，我感到一股热流通过我的全身。他的朴素的话语中流露出对民族对祖国的热爱。他的恳切的表情上闪露出对胜利的信心。他不倦地谈着，他越谈下去，这一切越是明显；他越谈下去，我们也越感到温暖，越充满信心。我的整个心被他的话吸引去了，我忘记了周围的一切，我忘记了时间的早晚，……我只看见眼前的这一个人，他镇静、安详，他的态度是那么坚定。他忽然发出了快乐的笑声，这时候我觉得他就是胜利的化身了，我们真可以放心地把一切都交给他，甚至自己的生命。我相信别的同志也有这样的感觉。
    我们的这种尊崇的表情一定让他看出来了，所以他接着说：“作战主要的是靠兵。自古以来兵强第一，强将不过是利益跟士兵一致的指挥员。指挥员好比乐队的指挥，有好的乐队没有好的指挥固然不行；可是单有好的指挥没有好的乐队也不行。个人要是不能代表绝大多数群众的利益，他便是很渺小的。”
    时间在不知不觉中过去了，他一直从容地谈下去，军事、政治、经济、文化各方面他都谈到了，他就这样生动、深刻而具体地给我们谈了三个钟头。他最后一次把左手从椅背上拿下，挺起腰来，结束了他的谈话。到了这时，我们才吐了一口气，注意到时间过得太快了。接着他听见副司令员跟我们的讲话中，最后讲到“欢迎”两字，他在旁边接下去说：“我虽然没有说欢迎，可是我心里是欢迎的！”这一句话使我们的心激动胜过千言万语，我们能够用什么话来说明我们的激动的心情呢？
    志愿军政治部甘主任在谈话中对我们说：“彭司令员这句话里含有很深的感情啊！”甘主任又说：“人都有感情，战士的心是更热烈和伟大的，有的战士背着炸药把自己生命跟敌人战车同归于尽。他们是不简单的，他们是有深厚的感情的。牺牲自己并不是容易的事，这样的感情我们不应该让它埋没，我们有责任把它表扬出来，让祖国人民知道。”甘主任是个爱发笑的人，可是这时候他的声音抖得厉害，他很激动，他也有深厚的感情。我激动得说不出一句话来，我们文艺工作者也是有感情的人，接触到这样伟大的心灵以后，难道我们还不能够交出个人的一切吗？
    晚上，我们走出洞来，雪落得更大了。汽车把我们送回到宿舍的山脚下，我们冒雪上山，好容易走到宿舍的洞口。这时雪花满天，冷气扑面，我埋头看山下只有一片白雪，没有一个人家漏出灯光。夜并不深，北京时间不过九点光景，在祖国的城市里该是万家灯火的时候，孩子安宁地睡在床上，母亲静静地在灯下工作，劳动了一天的人们都甜蜜地休息了。是谁在这遥远的寒冷的国土上保卫着他们的和平生活呢？祖国的孩子们是知道的，祖国的母亲们是知道的，全中国的人民都是知道的。
    祖国的孩子们的梦中的微笑，母亲们脸上的满足的表情，全国人民的幸福的笑容，就是对中国人民志愿军和他们的指挥员彭德怀将军的感激的表示。（附图片）
