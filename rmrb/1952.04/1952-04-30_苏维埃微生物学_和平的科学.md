    Soviet Microbiology—A Science of Peace
    By Professor Yerusalimsky, USSR
    Microbiology is the most humane of sciences. Its mission is to improve human life. It seeks ways to increase crop yields, prolong human life, and fight disease. This is how the outstanding representatives of this science understand the significance of microbiology. Soviet microbiologists serve this noble purpose.

    Across the ocean, warmongers violate the basic principles of humanity by turning microbiology into a tool for mass slaughter. American microbiologists, selling themselves for dollars, cultivate plague and cholera bacteria in their laboratories to spread in the cities and villages of Korea and China. They transform the science of preserving life into a tool of death. Such despicable acts, such profound depravity, have never been seen in history.

    In stark contrast to this unprecedented brutality, the peaceful aspirations of Soviet science and Soviet microbiologists are particularly evident and prominent. Soviet microbiologists inherit and develop the achievements of humanistic microbiologists of all eras and all nations.

    Microorganisms were used for industrial purposes long ago: brewing, baking bread, making beer, producing alcohol, vinegar, sauerkraut, sour milk, koumiss, and other products. Soviet researchers have selected many new and useful microorganisms from nature and applied them to industry. Some of them can form different organic acids, alcohol, and other chemical products necessary for the food industry, the chemical pharmaceutical industry, and other industrial sectors. Others can be used to make ferments, vitamins, and various antibacterial substances that have great significance in healthcare. A third type is used to produce highly nutritious protein yeast from non-nutritious raw materials. A fourth type is used to make bacterial fertilizers to increase crop yields. Modifying pathogens in an appropriate manner to create medical serums and vaccines is of particular significance in the fight against various diseases.

    The number of useful microorganisms is constantly growing. Scientists are discovering many new and useful microorganisms and putting them at the service of humanity. Microbiologists select organisms that are best suited to specific production conditions and cultivate improved bacterial strains.

    However, scientists are never limited to selecting existing forms in nature. To be able to rule the invisible world of organisms, to consciously and systematically change it for the needs of humanity, to create useful new species of microorganisms—this is the great task facing Soviet microbiologists. This leads to a sharp increase in production, improvements in food and chemical products, and increases in crop yields and technical crops, thereby greatly increasing people's material well-being. The ideals of advanced scientists around the world regarding conquering all infectious diseases with live vaccines have been fully realized. Live vaccines are strains of pathogens that have been weakened in their infectious properties and enhanced in their ability to resist disease.

    Is all of this possible? Science says yes, it is possible. The reality of these tasks is first and foremost irrefutably confirmed by the theory and practice of the Michurin school of biology. Microorganisms, like all living matter, grow, develop, adapt to environmental conditions, and produce things similar to themselves. From this, it naturally follows that their lives are subject to the general laws of the organic world, just like the lives of plants and animals. That being the case, it is clear that Michurin biology's laws regarding the decisive role of the external environment in the formation of living organisms, regarding the possibility and inevitability of one organism transforming into another, and finally, regarding the possibility of experimentally inducing such changes, are also applicable in the invisible world.

    Soviet biologists began working on solving the problem of transforming the nature of microorganisms very early on and have already achieved significant successes. The rich practical material of constant changes in various microorganisms leaves no room for any doubt; under the influence of the external environment, microorganisms can change, so that they often turn into other species. Academician Lysenko's theory of varietal changes in higher plants is fully applicable to microorganisms.

    In recent years, our scientists have widely applied Michurin's theory and have been able to cultivate many varieties of microorganisms that are practically useful by cultivating microorganisms under certain living conditions. Reliable methods for selecting and modifying the properties of organisms according to predetermined purposes have been studied and tested.

    In experimental work on changing the properties of microorganisms, the most widely used method is adaptation, i.e., the method of microorganisms gradually "getting used to" new, unusual environmental conditions. This is achieved by cultivating microorganisms under gradually more and more altered external conditions. As a result, microorganisms can adapt to new environments in such a way that they can no longer develop without this environment.

    For example, the adaptation method can transform the severe causative agent of gas gangrene into a non-infectious microorganism while simultaneously conferring immunity to this gas gangrene disease. Cultivating pathogens and viruses under unusual living conditions can weaken their infectious properties to such an extent that they can be used as vaccines for the treatment and prevention of various infectious diseases. Soviet medical microbiology is confidently preparing to deal with accidental epidemics.

    Professor Grinbaum's research in Gorky City is of great theoretical and practical significance for medicine. He determined that pathogens, depending on their different living conditions in the sick organism or in the surrounding external environment, can profoundly change their nature, even to the point of transforming into filterable (microscopically invisible) forms and becoming other species. Further development of this work will greatly promote the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

    In addition, "asexual hybridization" or "trait transmission" is also an important method for purposefully transforming the nature of microorganisms. Unlike the hybridization of higher plants, in this case, two microbial cells do not combine into a unified organism. "Asexual hybridization" here refers to cultivating various different microorganisms together, or cultivating one organism on the dead cells of another organism or even on its corroded matter. In this way, the first microorganism absorbs nutrients through the surface of its body, and also absorbs the biochemical characteristics of the second organism.

    Professor Kimakov's experience with typhoid-like bacteria can serve as a clear example of the effectiveness of the "asexual hybridization" method for microorganisms. Cultivating one type of these bacteria on the matter corroded by another, the cultivated species obtains all the properties and characteristics of the "directed" species, that is, it completely transforms into this other type. Sometimes, some forms are produced that are neither like the cultivated species nor like the directed species.

    Professor Kalina, a scientist from Ukraine, has also accumulated a wealth of material on "trait transmission." He was even able to transform one microorganism into another by using only the proteins extracted from the microorganism.

    Other methods are also used to transform microorganisms. Foreign Morgan geneticists believe that the use of strongly acting tools (X-rays, ultraviolet rays, radioactive rays, toxic chemicals) is almost the only way to obtain heritable changes, because, according to their terminology, these tools accelerate the occurrence of accidental "mutations."

    However, Soviet microbiologists have proven that radioactivity and poisons destroy certain components in the bodies of microorganisms, thereby distorting their metabolism, that is, heredity. As a result, biologically imperfect, deformed forms are obtained. In individual cases, degenerative changes in organisms can become practically useful, but this method cannot be considered as the main one.

    Purposefully promoting new changes in microorganisms that we need—this is only half the battle. It is important to consolidate and strengthen them in the future, and it is necessary to prevent microorganisms from degenerating and losing their useful properties. Soviet microbiologists have also victoriously solved this task. They know that all changes in the nature of microorganisms occur with the influence of their living conditions.

    Citing the following fact is sufficient to illustrate the scale of our country's microbiology. Eight hundred scientists participated in the All-Union Discussion on the Purposeful Transformation of Microorganisms held in Moscow. They represent all departments of microbiology—general microbiology, medical microbiology, industrial microbiology, agricultural microbiology, and veterinary microbiology. Each of these departments is of great significance for the socialist national economy.

    The achievements of Soviet microbiologists are outstanding, although they still have many things to do in order to make invisible objects completely subordinate to the interests and needs of peaceful workers. Managing and transforming microorganisms so that they prolong human life and make life triumph over death—this is our goal. A science with this as its task is truly a science of the people.

    That is why Soviet microbiologists, as well as all progressive scientists in other countries, for the sake of people's lives, must shame those "sciences" and "scientists" who serve the cannibalistic aims of the American imperialists (who attempt to use bacteriological weapons to slaughter millions of lives), and make them infamous for ten thousand years.

    The people of the world despise, hate, and curse the American misanthropes, who are destined by history to be eliminated.

    苏维埃微生物学——和平的科学
    苏联  耶鲁莎里姆斯基教授
    微生物学是最人道的科学。它的使命是改善人类的生活。它寻求途径以增加田禾收获，延长人的寿命，和疾病作斗争。这门科学的优秀代表人物正是这样认识微生物学的意义。苏维埃微生物学家就是为这种高尚目的而服务的。
    大洋彼岸的战争贩子们违反着人道主义的基本原则，把微生物学变成大量屠杀人类的工具。为美元而出卖自身的美国微生物学家们，在自己的实验室里培养鼠疫和霍乱病菌，以便在朝鲜和中国的城市和乡村撒布。他们把保卫生命的科学变成死亡的工具。这样的卑鄙行为，这样深重的堕落行为，是历史上所从不曾有过的。
    和这种前所未闻的惨暴罪行相对比，苏维埃科学和苏维埃微生物学家的和平志向是特别明显而突出的。苏维埃微生物学家在继承和发展着各个时代和
    一切民族的人道主义微生物学家的劳动成果。
    微生物在许久以前就被运用于工业目的上：酿酒，烤面包，酿啤酒，制造酒精、醋、酸菜、酸牛奶、酸马奶和其他产品等等。苏维埃的研究工作者从自然界中选择出许多种新的有用的微生物来，把它们运用在工业上。它们之中的一些可以构成不同的有机酸、酒精及其他如食品工业、化学制药工业和其他工业部门所必需的化学制品。用另一些微生物可以制造发酵剂、维他命和各种在保健方面有巨大意义的抗病菌物品。第三种用来从非营养的原料中产生有高度营养的蛋白质酵母。第四类用来制造细菌肥料，以提高田禾等的收获量。用以适当方式改造过的病菌制造医疗用血清和疫苗，对于和各种疾病作斗争具有特别重大的意义。
    有用的微生物的数目在不断增长。科学家发现了许多种新而又新的，有用的微生物，并使它们服务于人类。微生物学家选择了最适合于这种或那种生产条件的有机体，而培养出改良的细菌苗株。
    但是，科学家决不限于选择自然界中现有的形态。要能够统治看不见的有机体世界，为了人类的需要有意识地和有计划地改变它，创造有用的新种类的微生物——这就是摆在苏维埃微生物学家面前的伟大任务。这使得生产急剧增加，食品和化学制品改良，农作物和技术作物的收获量增加，从而使人们的物质福利大为增长。世界上先进科学家关于用活疫苗征服一切传染病的理想已完全实现了。活疫苗就是被减弱了传染疾病的性质并提高了抗疫能力的病菌的苗株。
    这一切是可能的吗？科学说，是的，是可能的。这些任务的现实性，首先由生物学界米丘林学派的理论和实践不可反驳地证实了。微生物，它也是活的物质，正像其他一切活的东西一样，它生长，发展，适应环境条件，产生和自己相似的东西。由此，自然就得出结论：它们的生活服从于有机世界的一般规律，动植物的生活也是一样。既然如此，那末，显然地，米丘林生物学关于外界环境对活有机体的形成起决定作用的法则，关于一种有机物变成另一种有机物的可能性和必然性的法则，以及最后，关于以实验的方法可以引起这种改变的可能性的法则，在看不见的世界里也是通用的。
    苏维埃生物学家很早就在为解决改造微生物的性质问题而工作，而且已经获得了重大的成就。各种微生物经常变化的丰富的实际材料，已不容有任何怀疑；在外界环境影响下，微生物能够变化，以致于往往变成另外的种类。李森科院士所发现的高等植物变种的学说，对于微生物完全适用。
    最近几年来，我国科学家广泛地运用了米丘林学说，能够用在一定生活条件下培养微生物的方法，养育出许多种对实际有用的品种。按照预先确定的目的选育和改造有机物的性质的可靠方法，已被研究出来并试验过。
    在改变微生物的性质的实验工作中，最广泛采用的是适应的方法，即微生物逐渐“习惯于”新的、不平常的环境条件的方法。这是在逐渐更多地改变外界条件下培养微生物而达到的。由于这样的结果，微生物能够这样地适应新的环境，以致于到后来没有这种环境它就不能够发展了。
    例如，适应的方法能够把气性坏疽病的严重媒介物改变成不传染病的微生物，且同时对这种气性坏疽病具有抗疫能力。在对它们异乎寻常的生活条件下培养病菌和病毒，能够这样地减弱它们的传染疾病的性质，以致可以把它们用作治疗和预防各种传染病的疫苗。对于偶然发生的流行病，苏维埃医学微生物学卓有把握地准备着去对付它。
    高尔基城的微生物学家格林巴乌姆教授的研究对于医学有巨大的理论的和实践的意义。他断定，病菌随着它在生病的有机体中或在周围外界环境中的不同的生活条件，能够深刻地改变其本质，直至转变为能过滤的（显微镜看不见的）形态和变成别的种类。这些工作再进一步发展下去，将大大地促进对传染病的预防和治疗。
    另外，“无性杂交”或“性质传授”也是有目的地改造微生物的本质的重要方法。和高等植物的杂交不同，在这种场合下，不是两个微生物细胞结合为一个统一的有机体。这里所说的“无性杂交”是指在一起培养各种不同的微生物，或是在另一种有机体的死细胞上甚至在它腐蚀了的物质上培养一种有机体。这样，第一种微生物用自己身体的表面吸取养料，也就吸收了第二者的生物化学特性。
    基马可夫教授关于肠胃伤寒类细菌的经验，可以作为微生物“无性杂交”方法的效果的显明例证。将这类细菌的一种放在为另一种所腐蚀的物质上来培养，被培养的物种便获得了“所引向的”物种的一切性质和特征，也即完全变成了这另外一种。有时，则产生一些既不像被培养的、又不像所引向的物种的形态。
    乌克兰的科学家卡林那教授也蓄积了许多关于“性质传授”的材料。他能够甚至只借助于从微生物身上取出的蛋白质而使一种微生物转化为另一种。
    改造微生物还运用其他的方法。外国的莫尔根遗传学家认为，运用有强烈作用的工具（X光、紫外线、放射性的光线、有毒的化学物品）几乎是得到遗传性变化的唯一方法，因为，按照他们的术语来说，这些工具加速了偶然“突变”的发生。
    然而，苏维埃微生物学家证明，放射能和毒物会破坏微生物身体中的某些组成物，因而歪曲它们的新陈代谢，即遗传性。结果，得到在生物学上不完善的、畸形的形态。在个别场合下，有机物退化的变化，可以成为实际上有用的，但是不能认为这种方法是主要的。
    有目的地促成微生物的新的、为我们所需要的变化——这只是事情的一半。重要的是要在以后巩固和增强它们，必须防止微生物退化，防止它失掉有用的性质。这一任务，苏维埃微生物学家也已经胜利地解决了。他们深知，微生物的本质的一切变化，都是随着它们生活条件的影响而发生的。
    举出以下一件事实，便足以说明我国微生物学的规模了。在莫斯科召开的关于有目的地改造微生物的全苏讨论会，有八百个科学家参加。他们代表着微生物学的所有部门——一般微生物学，医学微生物学，工业微生物学，农业微生物学和兽医微生物学。这些部门的每一种对于社会主义国民经济都有着巨大意义。
    苏维埃微生物学家的成就是卓著的，虽然他们还有许多事情要做，以便使看不见的物体完全服从于和平劳动者的利益和要求。管理和改造微生物，使它们延长人的生命，使生命战胜死亡——这就是我们的目的。以此为任务的科学，才是真正人民的科学。
    这就是为什么苏维埃微生物学家以及其他国家的
    一切进步科学家，为了人们的生命的原故，要羞辱那些服务于美帝国主义者（他们企图用细菌武器屠杀千百万人的生命）吃人目的的“科学”和“科学家”，使他们遗臭万年。
    世界各民族都鄙视、仇恨和诅咒美国的仇恨人类者，他们已为历史注定是要消灭的。
