    Evidence of Germ Warfare
    Yves Farge, President of the French Peace Council
    At first, the news caused great surprise. Everyone asked: Do the Chinese and Korean people have real evidence for this serious accusation against the United States?

    We read and reread the news from Asia, which calmly and objectively described how plague was found in Korea.

    We thought of the heroic Korean people, and also of our own people, because with the current advanced transportation, infectious diseases occurring here could spread to other places.

    Has the United States, regardless of international law, already begun to engage in germ warfare?

    While we held this question, news came one after another, which increased our concern.

    Acheson shirked responsibility, saying that the Chinese and Korean governments were not capable of "taking care of their own people," but we know that the Chinese and Korean people attach no less importance to public health than any country in Asia, so we have to admit that Acheson's words are untenable.

    American newspapers have widely publicized that this accusation is fictional and ridiculous, "because it is impossible for airplanes to drop mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and mice carrying bacteria on enemy positions."

    The United States has also created various excuses to defend itself, so we must bring up the past.

    More than a year ago, the public noticed a document that was not intended to be made public, which was named the "Terror Memorandum" after it was discovered. This is a report published by the "International Committee on European Problems." Some politicians who participated in the work of this committee denied that they had signed the report after the event: for example, Mr. Paul Reynaud only blamed this negligence, but he did not deny the existence of the committee and the detailed content of the report. In short, the existence and authenticity of the "Terror Memorandum" are undeniable.

    This report, partly published in "Le Monde" and "Action," especially aroused the attention of those criminals who were preparing to engage in germ warfare regarding the "amazing effects" of using airplanes to drop mosquitoes, flies, and mice carrying bacteria of bubonic plague, cholera, and yellow fever.

    Many related explanations and honest people have risen up to oppose this report, explaining that this kind of war is possible, and even desired by some people. We should think that if American institutions in France or Britain obtained this report, which seems impossible to publish without experiments, and that some people with social status participated in this matter, then things are not so simple…

    In short, in a book I wrote in May 1951 about the Korean War, "Corrupted Blood," I have already condemned this attempt and preparation for war crimes that violate international law.

    Therefore, no one, whether in the United States or in other countries, has the right to say: No one has thought of using insects and mice to carry out germ warfare. If anyone insists on saying this, it is showing his weakness in the face of accusations.

    But we must further question those who feel so uneasy in the face of the solemn accusations of the Chinese and Korean people.

    On September 14, 1951, "Action" published a report on germ warfare with great fanfare, and asked: "Did President Truman declare in a recent speech that the United States has begun to manufacture some 'amazing weapons,' is he talking about these germ weapons?"

    Regarding this question, I want to quote the words of a well-known Canadian figure, Mr. Paller Chowitzki, who accused: "American military germ warfare experts have used Eskimo people for germ experiments."

    In 1950, "The New York Times" published an interview with General Alden Waitt, former commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, who boasted: "We have the most famous scientists working in this field." In addition, an American scientist, Professor Feeman, wrote in the August 1948 issue of "Atomic Science": "Those bacteria that spread death can be thrown by airplanes or radio-controlled projectiles. There is no doubt that the most effective are cholera, dysentery, and bubonic plague."

    Now, bubonic plague has occurred simultaneously in several places in North Korea.

    The words that the United States and its friends in Europe have admitted in secret behind the scenes make us have to pay special attention to the shocking news from Korea.

    The civilized world has the right to demand justice and truth.

    细菌战争的证据
    法国和平理事会主席  依维斯·法奇
    起初，这个消息引起了人们莫大的惊讶。大家都这样发问：中朝人民对美国这个严重的控告有真凭实据吗？
    我们阅读了、反复地阅读了来自亚洲的消息，它们冷静地、客观地描述鼠疫怎样地在朝鲜发现。
    我们想到英勇的朝鲜人民，同时也想到我们自己的人民，因为在目前交通很发达的情况下，在此地发生的传染病可能蔓延到其他的地方。
    美国是否不顾国际公法，已在开始进行细菌战争了呢？
    我们存着这个疑问的时候，消息相继而来，这就增加了我们的忧虑。
    艾奇逊推诿责任，说中朝两国政府没有能力“照顾他们自己的人民”，但是，我们知道中朝两国对于公共卫生的重视，并不亚于亚洲的任何国家，因此我们不得不承认艾奇逊的话是不能自圆其说的。
    美国报纸大肆宣传这种控告是虚构而可笑的，“因为飞机不可能在敌人的阵地上抛下带着细菌的蚊子、苍蝇、跳蚤和老鼠。”
    美国还制造了各种藉口来为自己辩护，所以我们就必须旧事重提。
    一年多以前，舆论界注意到一个不打算公开的文件，它被发现后就被命名为“恐怖的备忘录”。这是“欧洲问题国际委员会”所发表的一篇报告。有些参加这个委员会的工作的政治人物，在事情发生之后，否认了他们曾在这报告上签名：例如保罗·雷诺先生虽然只怪责这种疏忽，但他并不否认这委员会的存在以及报告的详细内容。总之，“恐怖的备忘录”的存在及其真实性是无可辩驳的了。
    这个报告一部分在“世界报”和“行动报”上发表过，关于利用飞机投下带着腺鼠疫、霍乱和黄热病细菌的蚊子、苍蝇和老鼠等的“惊人效果”，特别引起了那些准备进行细菌战争罪犯们的注意。
    许多有关方面的说明和正直的人士都起来反对这个报告，说明了这种战争是可能的，甚至于是某些人所希望的。我们应该想到假如在法国或在英国的美国机关，获得了这份如果没有做过实验似乎是不可能发表的报告，想到一些有社会地位的人物参与了这件事，那么，事情就并不太简单了……
    总而言之，我在一九五一年五月写的一本关于朝鲜战争“腐化的血”里，我已谴责了这种违反国际公法的战争罪行的企图和准备。
    因此，不管是在美国或在其他的国家里，没有任何一个人有权利说：没有人想到利用昆虫和老鼠来进行细菌战争。假使有人硬要这样说，就是在控告的面前表示他的软弱。
    但是，我们必须更进一步质问那些在中朝人民严正的控告面前感到如此不宁的人们。
    一九五一年九月十四日“行动报”曾以极大的篇幅登载有关细菌战争的报道，并且问道：“杜鲁门总统在最近一次演说中宣称美国已开始制造一些‘惊人的武器’，他所谈的是否就是这种细菌武器呢？”
    关于这个问题，我要引用一位加拿大知名之士——柏勒卓维斯基先生的话，他控告说：“美军细菌专家曾以爱斯基摩人民做细菌的实验”。
    一九五○年，“纽约时报”发表了一篇前美军化学兵团指挥官艾德麟·怀特将军的访问记，他这样夸耀说：“我们拥有最有名的科学家在这方面工作”。另外有一位美国科学家菲曼教授在一九四八年“原子科学”八月号上写道：“那些传播死亡的细菌能够以飞机或由无线电控制的发射物来抛掷。毫无疑问的，最有效的是霍乱、痢疾和腺鼠疫。”
    如今，在北朝鲜几个地方已同时发生了腺鼠疫。
    美国以及它在欧洲的朋友们在背地里自招出来的话使我们不得不特别注意从朝鲜传来的惊人消息。
    文明世界有权利要求正义和真理。
    三月七日写于巴黎
