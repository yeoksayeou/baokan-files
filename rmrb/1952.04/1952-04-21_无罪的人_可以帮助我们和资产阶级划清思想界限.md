    “Guilty Without Guilt” Can Help Us Draw Ideological Boundaries with the Bourgeoisie
    Editor: I believe "Guilty Without Guilt" is an excellent film with positive educational significance. The tragic fate suffered by the female protagonist Kruchinina and her son Neznamov throughout their lives quickly reminds us of the women and children in old China, who were also frequently subjected to discrimination, exploitation, and abuse. This film profoundly exposes the ugly faces of the old Russian aristocracy and bourgeoisie, and therefore, it can also help us recognize the ugly faces of the feudal landlords and bourgeoisie in China. Showing this film during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements is of great help to us in understanding and drawing a clear ideological line with the bourgeoisie.

    Editor: I finished watching the Soviet film "Guilty Without Guilt" with tension and excitement. It seems as if the events in the film did not happen in the distant, long-ago era of Tsarist Russia, but in the era of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang not long ago. In that man-eat-man, man-oppressing-man society, how many mothers were forced to lose their sons, and how many orphans tasted the pain of human hell. At that time, many so-called illegitimate children could not hold their heads up to see people, could not stand up straight to speak, they could not experience what love is, they only had hatred. This situation was entirely created by people like Muroff. From Muroff, we see the dirty souls of the decadent exploiting classes.

    “无罪的人”可以帮助我们和资产阶级划清思想界限
    编辑同志：我认为“无罪的人”是一部带有积极教育意义的优秀影片。从影片中的女主角克鲁契宁娜和她的儿子聂兹那莫夫一生所遭受的悲惨命运，使我们很快联想到旧中国的妇女儿童，他们不也是经常遭受着歧视、玩弄和摧残吗？这部影片深刻地揭露了旧俄贵族和资产阶级的丑恶面貌，因此，它同样能够帮助我们认识中国的封建地主和资产阶级的丑恶面目。在“三反”“五反”运动中放映这部影片，它对于我们认识和划清资产阶级的思想界限，是有莫大帮助的。

    编辑同志：我以紧张、激动的心情，看完了苏联影片“无罪的人”。好像影片里的事情，不是发生在很远、很久以前的帝俄时代，而是发生在不久以前的蒋介石匪帮统治的时代。在那个人吃人、人压迫人的社会里，多少母亲被迫失去了儿子，多少孤儿尝尽了人间地狱的痛苦。当时许多所谓私生子不能抬起头来见人，不能直起腰来说话，他们体会不到什么是爱，他们只有仇恨。这种情况完全是摩罗夫一类人物造成的。从摩罗夫身上，我们看到了没落的剥削阶级的肮脏灵魂。
