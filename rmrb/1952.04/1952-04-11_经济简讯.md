    ▲ The award ceremony for the national agricultural model of patriotic bumper harvest in Southern Jiangsu District in 1951 was solemnly held in Wuxi City on March 29. The award winners included Chen Yongkang, Tang Baoming, Wu Changshou, Deng Huaiyin, who were models of rice bumper harvest, and Xitian Village in Jiangyin County, a bumper harvest village. More than 1,000 people attended the ceremony, including leaders of labor mutual aid teams, agricultural labor models, and representatives from all walks of life in Southern Jiangsu.

    ▲ Currently, there are more than 10,057,000 pigs in the entire Southwest Region, an increase of 39% compared to 1950. The development of pig farming is of great significance to both agriculture and industry. Rural areas with more pig farming do not feel the lack of fertilizer; bristles are important export commodities, and pigskins can be used as raw materials for leather making. People's governments at all levels in the Southwest Region pay great attention to the development of rural pig farming. Neijiang County in Southern Sichuan District has established a pig breeding improvement demonstration area and 30 pig breeding stations. There are also many breeding stations in Yunnan and Guizhou, and farmers have also organized some feeding groups. The successful promotion of crossbreeding between British pigs and Chinese pigs in the Beibei area near Chongqing and the double crossbreeding method of experimental pigs in Western Sichuan have provided conditions for increased production in pig farming.

    ▲ Last year, Liaoxi Province planted 3,350,000 mu of cotton. The cooperative prepared enough pesticides for 600,000 mu of cotton fields. However, because the cooperative cadres were unable to guide everyone in using them, farmers were only willing to use the familiar fish poison and "666" powder, and dared not use other new types of pesticides in large quantities. Learning from last year's lessons, this year the Liaoxi Provincial Cooperative Union has greatly increased the quantity of pesticides supplied compared to last year, and the variety of pesticides has also increased from 12 last year to 18. On the other hand, it has timely opened "Pesticide Use Training Classes", drawing 300 cadres from the central grassroots cooperatives of cotton and flax producing counties for pesticide knowledge education and technical training. The training class is taught by technicians sent by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the teaching content includes: scientific knowledge about crop pests, pesticide knowledge, pesticide use practice, pesticide storage methods, and sprayer use and simple repair methods. Now, on average, there is a technical cadre guiding pesticide use for every three rural grassroots cooperatives in the province.

    ▲ State-owned trading companies in various parts of Fujian Province are purchasing large quantities of local and special products and supplying farmers with fertilizers for spring plowing and production. This spring, the various local and special products such as sugar, paper, wood, and aquatic products purchased by trading companies throughout the province are worth more than 20 billion yuan. While purchasing local and special products, trading companies in various places are also transporting large quantities of soybean cake, superphosphate, etc. to key fertilizer sales areas and fertilizer-needed areas.

    ▲ In order to help farmers prevent and control insect pests and ensure a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, in addition to drawing cadres to cooperate with Party and government organs to mobilize and lead farmers to clear weeds, has also prepared 15,000 jin of arsenic (砒) to be sent to grassroots cooperatives in various counties to supply farmers to sow with seeds in the soil during spring plowing and sowing. At the same time, a large number of insecticide raw materials (estimated at 300,000 jin of tobacco leaves, 200,000 jin of alkali, 10,000 jin of sulfur, 200,000 jin of lime, and 300,000 jin of cotton oil soap) have been prepared, and 200 insecticide sprayers have been customized from Taiyuan Shanxi Machine Company to be quickly supplied to farmers for pest control when pests are discovered.

    ▲ Under the slogan of "Anti-Corruption Struggle and Business Go Hand in Hand", the Shijiazhuang Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, combined with the current disaster relief production task, completed the transportation task of transferring cotton to Qingdao and increasing the allocation of tens of thousands of dan of cotton to Shanghai ahead of schedule on March 23, ensuring the timely supply of textile raw materials. In addition, the leading cadres of this company, in order to avoid the wetting and mildew damage of materials due to the rising spring tide, generally inspected the stored materials and improved the storage work.

    ▲ The Meiyu season in the Central and Southern China region is approaching. In order to strengthen the storage of public grain to prevent mildew, the Trade Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee has drawn cadres to form five inspection teams, which will go to Henan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to inspect the storage of grain by state-owned grain companies; and instructed the Guangxi Provincial Department of Commerce to organize inspections by itself. Wuhan City will also be organized for inspection by cadres dispatched by the department. The task of the inspection team is to understand the situation of the combination of the "Three-Anti" movement and grain protection work in various places, mobilize the masses to launch a grain protection movement, exchange experience in grain protection work, go deep into warehouses with emphasis, solve difficulties in a timely manner, and achieve the goal of "not spoiling a single grain". The inspection time is expected to be one and a half months.

    经济简讯
    ▲一九五一年全国农业爱国丰产模范苏南区授奖典礼，三月二十九日在无锡市隆重举行。受奖者有水稻丰产模范陈永康、唐宝铭、吴长寿、邓槐银和一个丰产村——江阴县西田头村。参加典礼的有苏南各地劳动互助组长、农业劳动模范、各界人民代表共千余人。
    ▲现在西南区全区的猪约有一千零五十七万多头，较一九五零年增加了百分之三十九。养猪事业发展，对于农业和工业都有重大的意义。养猪较多的农村，就不感肥料缺乏；猪鬃是重要的出口物资，猪皮可作制革的原料。西南各级人民政府都很注意发展农村养猪事业。川南区内江县就成立有养猪改良示范区和三十处猪种配种站。云南、贵州各地也有不少配种站，而且农民中还组织一些饲养小组。重庆附近北碚地区，推广英国猪和中国猪的杂交方法和川西区试验猪的二重交配法的成功，对养猪事业提供了增产的条件。
    ▲辽西省去年植棉三百三十五万亩，合作社曾准备了够六十万亩棉田使用的农药。但是由于合作社干部不能指导大家使用，农民除了对已熟悉的鱼腾精和“六六六”粉愿意使用以外，对其他大批新品种的农药都不敢使用。接受了去年的教训，今年辽西省合作社联合社一方面在农药的供应数量上较去年大为增加，农药的品种也由去年的十二种增加到十八种；另一方面适时地开办了“农药使用训练班”，从棉、麻产区各县中心基层合作社抽调了三百名干部予以农药知识教育和技术训练。训练班由该省农林厅派技术人员担任教员，教学内容有：关于作物害虫的科学常识，农药常识，农药使用实习，农药保管法，喷雾器使用和简单修理法。现全省平均每三个农村基层合作社即有一个指导农药使用的技术干部。
    ▲福建省各地国营贸易公司大量收购土产特产和供应农民春耕生产肥料。今春全省各地贸易公司已收购的各种土产特产如糖、纸、木材和水产等共值两百多亿元。各地贸易公司在收购土产特产的同时，并即将大批豆饼、肥田粉等运到重点销肥地区和需肥地区。
    ▲石家庄专区供销合作总社为帮助农民防治虫害、保证今年棉粮丰产，除抽出干部配合党、政机关动员和领导农民清除杂草外，并已准备出信石
    （砒）一万五千斤发往各县基层合作社，供给农民在春耕播种时和种籽一起播入土中。同时，准备了大量杀虫药剂原料（计烟叶三十万斤、碱面二十万斤、硫磺一万斤、石灰二十万斤、棉油皂三十万斤），并在太原山西机器公司定制了杀虫喷雾器二百架，以备发现害虫时迅速供给农民作除虫之用。
    ▲中国花纱布公司石家庄分公司，在“反贪污斗争和业务两不误”的口号下，结合了当前救灾生产任务，于三月二十三日，提前完成了三月份向青岛调运棉花、及给上海增拨数万担棉花的运输任务，保证了纺织原料的及时供应。另外，这个公司的领导干部，为了避免因春潮上升而对物资的浸湿霉损，对仓储物资普遍进行检查，改进了保管工作。
    ▲中南地区黄梅雨季将到，为加强公粮保管，以防霉坏，中南军政委员会贸易部已抽调干部组成五个检查组，分赴河南、广东、江西、湖南、湖北五省检查国营粮食公司存粮保管情况；并指示广西省商业厅自行组织检查。武汉市也将由该部调派干部组织检查。检查组的任务是了解各地“三反”运动和护粮工作相结合的情况，发动群众展开护粮运动，交流护粮工作经验，有重点地深入仓库，及时解决困难，达到“不坏一粒粮”的目的。检查时间预计为一个半月。
