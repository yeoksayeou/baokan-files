Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. Nineteen Chinese medical, entomological, bacteriological, and virological experts and professors, including Wu Zhizhong, who are currently engaged in the anti-bacterial warfare struggle in Northeast China, jointly issued a statement on the 8th, supporting the two investigation reports recently published by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team and the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military in Northeast China. They also expressed warm welcome to the proposal made in the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" issued by the Executive Bureau Meeting of the World Peace Council to establish an international committee capable of collecting all the facts for investigation. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    We are scientific workers standing on the front line of anti-bacterial warfare, and we see evidence of the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare crimes every day. Based on the conscience of scientific workers and the spirit of human morality, we have provided the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team and the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" with a portion of the results that we have personally identified and tested. When the above two investigation teams made public the evidence of the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare crimes, we, as witnesses, express our complete agreement with the facts listed in their reports and our solemn support for the just conclusions and just demands put forward in their reports. We also support the "Appeal to Men and Women of the World Against Bacteriological Warfare" adopted by the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and the resolutions made by the council.

    The bacteriological warfare waged by the U.S. aggressors has been prepared for a long time, and their intentions are extremely malicious. We have already obtained an article on "Bacteriological Warfare" published in the American "Journal of Immunology" in January 1947 by Professor Rosebury and Kabat of Columbia University in New York, and thirteen other reports. These reports all prove that the U.S. aggressors are attempting to destroy all living beings in the world; attempting to turn all the beautiful mountains and rivers in all peaceful countries into plague-ridden disaster areas; attempting to use deadly bacteriological warfare to threaten all peace-loving people in the world. This insane criminal act is a blasphemy against the dignity of science. Since ancient times, science has been a product of civilization created by human labor, but what the U.S. aggressors have done is a heinous crime that violates historical laws and natural laws, and they will surely be punished justly by the people.

    We have found various bacteria and viruses in the large number of insects spread by U.S. aircraft. For example, springtails carry rickettsiae; spiders carry bacteria of the genus Pasteurella; midges and large flies carry typhoid bacteria; dung flies carry paratyphoid bacteria; and winter mosquitoes carry strong viruses that damage brain tissue. We have also found bacteria and viruses in the poisons spread by U.S. military aircraft. For example, feathers contain anthrax bacilli; and another type of Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene, was found on the shrapnel of bacteriological bombs discovered in Kuandian.

    We are unwilling to announce one by one in the solemn language of mankind the despicable and filthy bestial acts of the American bacteriological war criminals, as well as the harm that such crimes have brought to our peaceful people. In order to safeguard the dignity of science and the justice of mankind, we lodge a complaint with an irrepressible feeling of anger against the heinous crimes of the American bacteriological war criminals. All peace-loving people in the world and all conscientious scientific workers must pay serious attention to this bloody fact. National borders are not impenetrable walls. Today, U.S. aggressors have spread bacteria on Chinese territory, and tomorrow, they will spread bacteria in any other corner of the world.

    The evil conspiracy of the U.S. aggressors is becoming increasingly blatant. All peace-loving people and conscientious scientific workers in the world should form an unbreakable front against bacteriological warfare. We, the scientific workers standing on the front line of anti-bacterial warfare, pledge to contribute all our strength to the safety of all mankind and the final victory of anti-bacterial warfare.

    正在东北参加反细菌战斗争的我国医学等专家联名声明
    支持对美军细菌战罪行的两个调查报告
   【新华社沈阳十日电】正在东北地区从事反细菌战斗争的我国医学、昆虫学、细菌学、病毒学等专家、教授吴执中等十九人，八日联名发表声明，支持国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团日前所发表的两个关于美国军队在中国东北使用细菌武器的调查报告，并对世界和平理事会执行局会议发表的“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书中所提出的成立一个能够收集一切事实的国际委员会进行调查一事，表示热烈欢迎。声明全文如下：
    我们是站在反细菌战最前线的科学工作者，每天都看到美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证。我们根据科学工作者的良心和人类的道义精神，曾将亲眼鉴定、亲手化验的一部分结果，提供给国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团。当上述两个调查团将美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证公诸于世的时候，我们以见证人的资格，对他们在报告中所列举的事实表示完全同意，对他们在报告中所提出的公正结论和正义主张表示严正支持。我们并拥护世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”告全世界男女书和该会所作的决议。
    美国侵略者所进行的细菌战是经过长期准备的，其用心是十分毒辣的。我们业已获得的纽约哥伦比亚大学教授罗兹伯里和卡巴特于一九四七年一月在美国“免疫学杂志”上所发表之“关于细菌战”一文及其它十三篇报告，这些报告都证明了美国侵略者妄想毁灭世界上一切生灵；妄想把世界上所有和平国度里的锦绣山河都变成瘟疫横行的灾区；妄想用死亡的细菌战来威胁全世界爱好和平的人民。这种丧心病狂的犯罪行为是对科学尊严的亵渎。亘古以来，科学是人类劳动创造出来的文明产物，美国侵略者所干的却是违背历史规律和自然法则的滔天罪行，它们必将受到人民的正义惩罚。
    我们曾在美国飞机撒布的大量昆虫中，查出了各种细菌和病毒。如跳虫带有立克次氏小体；蜘蛛带有巴斯德杆菌属的细菌；摇蚊和大家蝇带有伤寒菌；粪蝇带有副伤寒菌；冬大蚊带有损害脑组织的强烈的病毒等。我们并查明了美国军用飞机撒布的毒物中也有细菌和病毒。如羽毛含有炭疽杆菌；在宽甸发现的细菌弹弹片上更检查出另一种招致气性坏疽的魏氏杆菌。
    我们不愿意以人类庄严的语言来一一宣布美国细菌战犯的卑鄙龌龊的兽行，以及由于这种罪行所带给我国和平人民的危害。为了维护科学的尊严和人类的正义，我们以难以抑止的愤怒心情，对美国细菌战犯这一滔天罪行提出控诉。全世界爱好和平的人民和一切有良心的科学工作者必须严正地注意这个血的事实。国家的疆界并不是不能穿过的围墙。今天，美国侵略者已把细菌撒布在中国的领土上，明天，它们将会把细菌撒布在世界上其它的任何一个角落。
    美国侵略者的罪恶阴谋日益露骨了，全世界爱好和平的人民和有良心的科学工作者应该结成牢不可破的反细菌战的战线。我们站在反细菌战最前线的科学工作者，誓为争取全人类的安全和反细菌战的最后胜利，贡献出自己的一切力量。
