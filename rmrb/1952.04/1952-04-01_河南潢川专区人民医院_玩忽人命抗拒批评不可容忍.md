    Henan Huangchuan Special District People's Hospital
    Neglecting Human Life and Resisting Criticism is Intolerable
    Editor: The medical staff of the Huangchuan Special District People's Hospital in Henan Province do not care about patients, are careless in their work, and exhibit a strong focus on profit and a serious bureaucratic style. After being admitted to the hospital, patient Sun Shidian had gradually recovered his health. One day, Dr. Lei Zuolin injected him with twice the dose of "606," and the patient immediately felt agitated. The doctor then gave him seven ?amine pills, and the patient died that very night. Patients Wen Suzhi and Sun Yaozan became disabled due to the doctor's incorrect treatment. Such errors are too numerous to mention.
    The hospital's director, Li Huaibao, has a very bad attitude towards criticism. When patients offer suggestions, he calls them "naughty" and "difficult to serve," even saying, "I have to fix him." As a result, patients are afraid to offer him any suggestions. When he found out that someone had offered criticism, he immediately called a meeting of the patients, saying, "Okay, you accuse me, but you must know that you can accuse my director, but you can't accuse my section chief (he is not even a section chief at all); you can accuse my section chief, but you can't accuse my director (he concurrently serves as the director of the Huai River Management Headquarters' Health Department)."
    A cadre from Huangchuan County suffered from an acute illness, and the Huangchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party introduced him to the hospital for treatment, but the hospital refused to accept him. One staff member even said, "No matter who he is, he must pay 6 million yuan before being admitted." Once, the Huangchuan County People's Government introduced an honored veteran to the hospital for treatment, and Li Huaibao said, "Pay 3 million yuan first."
    The people of Huangchuan County are very dissatisfied with the hospital. I hope that the relevant leading organs will send people to inspect the work of the hospital.

    Editor's note: The extremely bad attitude of the Henan Huangchuan Special District People's Hospital in neglecting human life and resisting criticism is absolutely intolerable. The People's Government of Henan Province should send people to thoroughly investigate it.

    河南潢川专区人民医院
    玩忽人命抗拒批评不可容忍
    编辑同志：河南省潢川专区人民医院的医务人员，不关心病人，工作粗枝大叶，表现了浓厚的单纯营利观点和严重的官僚主义作风。病人孙世典自入院以后，身体已逐渐恢复健康。有一天，雷作霖大夫给他多注射了一倍的“六○六”，当时病人便觉得心境烦燥；大夫又叫他服了七粒?胺药，病人当晚就气绝身死。病人闻素芝和孙耀三，因大夫治疗错误，成了残废。诸如此类的错误，真是举不胜举。
    该院院长李槐保对待批评的态度是非常恶劣的，病人向他提意见，他就说病人“调皮”、“难伺候”，甚至说：“非整他一下不可”。因此，病人有了意见，都不敢向他提。他知道了有人对他提意见，马上就召集病人开会，说：“好，你们告发我，但是你们须知道，告掉我的院长，告不掉我的科长（他根本并不是什么科长）；告掉我的科长，告不掉我的处长（他兼任治淮指挥部卫生处长）。”
    潢川县有一干部害急性病症，中共潢川县委介绍他到该医院医治，但院方不肯接收。有一位工作人员竟说：“管他是谁，先交六十万元才得入院。”有一次潢川县人民政府介绍一位荣誉军人到该院医治，李槐保说：“先交三十万元再说。”
    潢川县的群众对该院非常不满。我希望有关领导机关，派人对该院的工作进行检查。

    编者按：河南潢川专区人民医院这样玩忽人命和抗拒批评的极端恶劣态度，是决不能容忍的。河南省人民政府应派人彻底予以查究。
