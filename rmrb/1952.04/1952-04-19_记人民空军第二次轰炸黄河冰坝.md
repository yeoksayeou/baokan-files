    Record of the People's Air Force's Second Bombing of the Yellow River Ice Dam
    Huo Shu
    The Yellow River within the territory of Suiyuan, with its annual ice floods, seriously threatens the peaceful life of the people in the Hetao area.

    Last year, the People's Liberation Army Air Force and artillery, assisted the people of Suizhong in overcoming the largest ice flood in fifty years. Hundreds of thousands of people and over a million mu of fertile land in Hetao were rescued from the brink of flood disaster. The deeds of Chairman Mao's army assisting the people in overcoming the ice floes were widely praised. During the autumn harvest, this area had an even richer harvest than in previous years; people celebrated the harvest with joy, singing and thanking Chairman Mao, the people's savior.

    This spring, the people of Suiyuan responded to the government's call for patriotic production increase with even greater enthusiasm. On the one hand, they prepared the spring plowing work properly, and at the same time, under the leadership of the People's Government, they formed a flood prevention army, working day and night to repair embankments and prevent floods. From March 10th to 29th, the residents along the river, with the strong assistance of the artillery, fought the ice floes for nearly three weeks, destroying more than ten ice dams and ice bridges, and抢堵（抢堵 is a specific term relating to hurriedly blocking breaches during a flood）the gaps in the embankments. It seemed that there would be no major problems with this year's ice flood. However, on March 30th, the situation suddenly changed. The river channel between Baotou and Tuoketuo County was almost entirely blocked by ice dams several miles long. A giant ice dam about seven miles long and six feet thick at Liwuyingzi in Sa County blocked the water flow, and the water level rose by two feet in two hours. The masses rushed back and forth carrying soil to raise and thicken the flood control dikes, and the artillery bombarded the ice dam intensively. The situation was extremely critical, and the ice floes and floodwaters continued to rush down from the upper reaches. It seemed that the Suizhong farmlands were about to suffer a flood disaster again.

    But they had a belief: the Communist Party and Chairman Mao would help them overcome this disaster. They hoped that Chairman Mao would send planes to blow up this evil ice dam, just like last year.

    Their hopes were realized. Chairman Mao gave the order to send planes to help them fight the ice floes.

    When the comrades of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force received the task of flying to Suiyuan to bomb the ice dam the next morning, it was already seven or eight o'clock in the evening. Although time was tight and the situation was unknown, they knew they were going to eliminate harm for the people, how could these difficulties stop them? That night, after the unit's Party committee arranged the task, the aircrews immediately studied the route. Comrade Yang Dehua, who participated in the bombing of the ice dam last year, introduced the situation of the ice dam to everyone. They discussed it until late at night before going to sleep. The ground crews prepared the aircraft overnight as if they were preparing for a night flight, before returning to the dormitory to rest. They dozed for a while, and before dawn, they arrived at the airport again, checked the aircraft parts, and waited for the aircrews to take off immediately.

    That day, the weather was also bad, and the wind speed was very high, but in order to help the people overcome this critical disaster, they finally disregarded these difficulties and resolutely embarked on the journey.

    After flying continuously for several hours, the plane landed safely at Baotou Airport. The leader of the Air Force greeted the representatives of the local government who were already waiting at the airport and inquired in detail about the ice floes at that time. As soon as the two planes stopped, they immediately went out to reconnoiter along the river. After a long journey of continuous flying, they were of course a little tired, but what did it matter that their bodies were tired for the happy life of the lovable working people? When they learned that the floodwaters in Liwuyingzi were about to overflow the dike, they silently and nervously added fuel, hung up the bombs, and climbed into the cockpit and flew out.

    At noon, the people on the dike heard the sound of airplanes and knew that the planes sent by Chairman Mao had arrived. Everyone was as excited as anything. Smiles spread across everyone's tense faces, forgetting the fatigue of the past few days, and it seemed as if strength had been added to their hands. Digging, carrying, and filling soil all seemed easier.

    When the plane flew over the Yellow River, countless welcoming hands were extended by the people on the embankment, and the cry of "Chairman Mao's plane has come" immediately resounded throughout the fields along the river. The plane soared, and bombs exploded one by one on the ice dam, raising pillars of water that soared into the sky; the huge ice dam issued a roar like a landslide and tsunami. The floodwaters from the upper reaches took the opportunity to冲动（冲动 in this context means to break free/be set into motion）, and with the rushing water, the ice floes flowed downstream. Soon the water level here dropped.

    The ice flood disaster was overcome under the efforts of the Air Force, artillery, and the people. The people of Hetao smiled from the bottom of their hearts, deeply believing that this year there would be another great harvest like last year. Everyone realized more deeply from this living fact that the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Army will always serve the people. In the past, aircraft, artillery, and bombs were in the hands of reactionary rulers, and they were always used as tools to massacre the people in large numbers; now these weapons are in the hands of the people, but they have become tools to directly create a happy life for the people. American imperialism used these weapons to slaughter millions of people! Recently, it has even used aircraft to wage a heinous bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China. The people of Hetao have expressed that they must work hard to produce and do a good job in epidemic prevention to support the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and defeat the US imperialist aggressors.

    记人民空军第二次轰炸黄河冰坝
    霍书
    绥远境内的黄河，一年一度的凌汛，严重地威胁着河套一带人民的安乐生活。
    去年，人民解放军空军、炮兵，协助绥中人民战胜了五十年来最大的一次凌汛。河套几十万人民，百余万亩良田，从洪水浩劫的边缘上，被拯救了出来。毛主席的军队协助人民战胜冰凌的事迹，到处被传颂着。秋收的时候，这一带得到了比往年更丰富的收获；人们满怀着喜悦的心情，欢庆着丰收，歌唱着和感谢着人民的救星毛主席。
    今春，绥远人民以更高的生产热情响应了政府的爱国增产号召。他们一方面把春耕工作准备停当，同时又在人民政府领导下组成了一支防凌大军，白天黑夜地投入了修堤防洪工作。从三月十日至二十九日，沿河居民，在炮兵大力协助下，和冰凌搏斗了近三个星期，轰毁了十多座冰坝、冰桥，抢堵了堤防的缺口，眼看今年的凌汛没大问题了。但是到了三月三十日，情况突然变化，包头到托克托县间的河道上，几乎都结上了长达数里的冰坝。萨县李五营子一座长约七里、厚达六尺的巨型冰坝，堵塞着水流，在两小时里水位竟涨了两尺。群众飞奔着来回担土加高和加厚防洪堤，炮兵集中地轰射着这座冰坝，情势真是万分危急，上流的冰块、洪水继续奔流着，眼看绥中田园又要遭受洪水的浩劫。
    但是，他们有一个信念：共产党、毛主席会帮助他们度过这个浩劫。他们希望毛主席派飞机来，像去年一样地把这万恶的冰坝炸开。
    他们的希望实现了，毛主席又下命令派飞机来帮助他们向冰凌作斗争了。
    中国人民解放军空军某部同志们接到翌日清晨飞绥远炸冰坝的任务时，已经是晚间七八点钟了，虽然时间紧迫、情况不了解，但他们知道是去为人民除害，这些困难又怎么会拦阻住他们呢？当晚，在部队党委布置了任务后，空勤人员马上研究了航线，去年参加轰炸冰坝的杨德华同志又向大家介绍了冰坝的情况，他们直讨论到深夜才睡；地勤同志们像准备夜航一样地把飞机连夜准备停当，才回到宿舍休息，他们眯了眯眼，黎明前又到了机场，检查了机件，等待着空勤人员的立刻起飞。
    这天，刚又碰上气候不好，风速很大，但为了帮助人民战胜这危急的灾害，他们终于不顾这些，毅然地跨上了征途。
    连续飞行数小时后，飞机在包头机场上安然着陆了。空军领队的同志迎着已经在机场上等候着的地方政府的代表们，详细地询问了当时冰凌的情况。两架飞机刚停下来，马上又出动去沿河侦察了。连续长途的飞行，他们当然有些疲乏，但这是为着可爱的劳动人民的幸福生活，身体累了又算得什么呢？当他们知道李五营子的洪水已经快要到漫堤的时候，他们一声不响地、紧张地加上了油，挂上了炸弹，跨进座舱飞出去了。
    午前，堤上的人们就听见了飞机的响声，知道这是毛主席派的飞机来了，大家兴奋得什么似地。每个人紧张的面孔上展开了微笑，忘记了连日的劳累，手上好像增加了力量似地，挖土、担土、填土，都显得更轻快了。
    当飞机飞临在黄河上空的时候，堤上的人们伸出了无数的欢迎的手，“毛主席的飞机来了”的呼声，立刻响遍了沿河的田野。飞机在翱翔，炸弹一颗颗在冰坝上爆炸了，激起了一支支的水柱，冲向天际；巨大的冰坝发出了山崩地裂般的吼声，上流的洪水，乘势把它冲动了，随着奔腾的流水，冰块向下流了。很快这里的水位就降低了。
    凌汛的灾难，在空军、炮兵和人民的努力抢救下度过了。河套的人民从心里发出了微笑。深信今年又会和去年一样的出现一个大好丰收。大家从这活生生的事实里，更深刻地认识了共产党、人民政府、人民军队永远是为人民服务的。以前飞机、大炮、炸弹掌握在反动统治者的手里，从来就是用来大批地屠杀人民的工具；现在这些武器掌握在人民的手里，却变成了直接为人民创造幸福生活的工具了。美帝国主义用这些武器屠杀了千百万的人民！最近更用飞机对朝鲜和中国人民进行万恶的细菌战。河套人民纷纷表示：一定要努力生产，作好防疫工作，来支援抗美援朝战争，打败美帝国主义侵略者。
