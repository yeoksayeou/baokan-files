    Shanghai has continued to comprehensively advance the work of classifying and processing small and medium industrial and commercial businesses. As of the 23rd, settlements have been announced for over 50,000 businesses, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of small and medium industrial and commercial businesses in the city.

    In the process of handling these cases, all districts have implemented a spirit of seriousness and conscientiousness, first educating the workers and employees. They were especially cautious in handling the middle-sized businesses. When handling forty-four middle-sized businesses in the Changning Road area of Changning District, cadres first studied the relevant policies, then separately convened meetings of activists and senior staff among the employees of each business to explain the policies and solicit their opinions. After the masses had fully deliberated and mobilized, meetings were then held with the owners of each business. During these meetings, policies were explained, the methods of handling were described, and the opinions of the employees of each business were conveyed to them, urging them to be honest and frank, and to admit their mistakes. After the owners' meetings, employee representative meetings were held. At these meetings, in addition to reporting on the owners' meetings, the policies and guidelines for handling small and medium industrial and commercial businesses were repeatedly explained. Only after completing these specific educational and preparatory tasks were review meetings convened. In this way, the law-breaking owners were able to honestly confess and admit their mistakes at the meetings, and the employees were able to conduct the review seriously and lawfully. Many employee representatives, after stamping their approval on the owners' confessions, solemnly instructed the owners: "We have stamped your approval, and you must never engage in illegal activities again." The owners handed over their confessions and written pledges to the workers' representatives for submission to the district's Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee for review. After the review and approval, a settlement meeting was convened and notices were issued. Finally, the area convened a summary meeting of the employee representatives from the forty-four businesses, calling on everyone to revise the Patriotic Pact, improve production, and welcome the Red May.

    The process of handling small businesses in each district was generally simple and rapid, taking as little as three days and no more than four or five days. The District Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee held large-scale meetings in batches to explain policies to the owners in attendance, appealing to them with righteousness, and distributed forms for them to fill out, detailing their illegal activities. At the same time, they conducted investigations with the local shop employees' unions, collecting materials on the illegal activities of each business and reviewing the owners' confessions. If the confessions were not thorough enough, they were asked to supplement them. When the confessions were nearly complete, a settlement meeting was convened. Because the policies had deeply penetrated the people's hearts, many small business owners were able to better confess their problems. However, there were also a few who were unwilling to be frank. For example, out of the 348 businesses in the Guanqiao police station area of Penglai District, twenty were not approved at the first settlement meeting because their confessions were unclear. When the owner of Lao Xiechang in Changning District was filling out his confession form, he said to his employees: "Let's have labor-management cooperation. You give me your opinions, and I'll fill out the form." The employees knew he wanted to "test the waters" and immediately gave him a stern education, urging him to be thoroughly frank himself.

    The vast majority of the small and medium industrial and commercial businesses that have been processed are law-abiding or basically law-abiding. From the concrete handling process, they realized that the People's Government's policy towards them is one of unity, education, and transformation. Therefore, after receiving the notices, they generally increased their enthusiasm for business. Many owners wrote letters to the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee to express their gratitude and busied themselves with formulating production plans, preparing to rationally use funds, and expand commodity sales. Xu You'er, the owner of Fusenxiang Fried Goods Store in Xincheng District, prepared to retrieve the funds he had previously withdrawn from the store to develop his business. Genji Children's Clothing Store stocked a large number of seasonal goods after the settlement. After the settlement, the business style of each business also underwent great changes, and new labor-management relations emerged. The owner of Jinxingshun Cotton Shop in Xuhui District said: "I was not honest before. From now on, I will card cotton honestly and never put bad cotton in again." After the settlement, Dafang Silk Fabric Company in Luwan District convened a labor-management symposium and formulated future business guidelines. Wang Wenheng, the owner of Yihua Machine Factory in Changning District, discussed production plans with the workers and decided to open another machine to expand production.

### 上海市已对五万多中小工商户宣告定案

    上海市已对五万多中小工商户宣告定案
    上海市中小工商业户的分类处理工作继续全面进行，到二十三日止已有五万多户宣告定案，占全市中小工商业户总数三分之一以上。
    各区在处理过程中，都贯彻了严肃认真的精神，事先对职工进行了教育；对中户的处理尤为慎重。长宁区长宁路地段在处理四十四户中等户时，干部首先进行政策学习，然后分别召开各户职工群众中的积极分子和高级职员会议，说明政策，征求他们的意见。在群众充分酝酿发动以后，再召开各户老板会议，会上一面交代政策，说明处理办法，一面把各户职工意见交给他们，促其老实坦白，低头认错。在老板会议后，又召开职工代表会议，会上除报告召开老板会议的情况外，并反复说明处理中小工商户的政策方针。做好这些具体的教育和准备工作，才召开审查会议。这样，违法老板们都能在会上坦白交代，低头认错；职工们也都能依理依法认真地进行审查。许多职工代表在盖章通过老板的坦白书后，还严肃地叮嘱老板说：“我们已给你盖章了，以后一定不许再干违法的事。”老板把坦白书和具结书交给工人代表转交区增产节约委员会审查，经审查批准后，再召开定案会议，发给通知书。最后，该地段又召集四十四户的职工代表进行总结，号召大家修订爱国公约，搞好生产，迎接红五月。
    各区处理小户的过程一般都很简单迅速，少的三天，多的不过四五天。区增产节约委员会一面分期分批召开大会，对到会老板说明政策，晓以大义，并发给表格，要他们填写自己的违法行为；同时又和当地店员工会进行调查，搜集各户的违法材料，审查老板的坦白材料。交代不够彻底的，就要他补充，在交代得差不多时，即召开定案大会。由于政策深入人心，许多小工商户的老板都能较好地交代自己的问题。但也有少数不肯坦白的。如蓬莱区关桥派出所地区三百四十八户中，有二十户因交代不清，在第一次定案大会上就没有通过。长宁区老协昌老板在填写坦白书时，对职工说：“我们劳资合作，你们提意见，我来填表。”职工知道他想“摸底”，当即给他严正的教育，要他自己彻底坦白。
    经过处理的中小工商户，绝大部分是守法户和基本守法户。他们从具体处理过程中，体会到人民政府对他们的方针是团结、教育和改造，因而在接到通知书后普遍地提高了经营积极性。许多老板写信给市增产节约委员会表示感谢，并忙着制订生产计划，准备合理使用资金，扩展商品销路。新成区福森祥炒货店老板徐有二，准备将过去从店内抽出的资金取回发展业务。根记童装商店在定案后新进了大批时令货。各户在处理定案后，经营作风也有了很大的改变，并出现了新的劳资关系。徐汇区金兴顺棉花店老板说：“以前我不老实，以后我弹棉花，再不把坏棉花夹进去了。”卢湾区大方绸布公司在定案后，召开了劳资座谈会；订出了今后经营方针。长宁区艺华机器厂老板王文衡，和工人商订了生产计划，决定多开一部机器，以扩充生产。
