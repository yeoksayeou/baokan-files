Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 16th: The International Children's Defense Conference continued its sessions on the 14th, discussing reports and hearing a report from Cavalieri, Deputy Head of the Investigation Team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, on the germ warfare being conducted by the American imperialists.

    At the morning session, the first speaker was Kang Keqing, a representative from China. She said that for the first time in Chinese history, the rights of mothers and children have been guaranteed. More than 10,000 maternity stations have been established nationwide, and more than 110,000 traditional birth attendants in rural areas have received scientific midwifery education. Kindergartens, nurseries, and sanatoriums have been widely established in various regions. The number of nurseries during the busy farming season last year increased by 106 times compared to the previous year. All of this has enabled millions of women to actively participate in the country's political, cultural, and economic life. At present, the number of children enrolled in schools in China has exceeded the highest level of 1946 during the Kuomintang rule by 56 percent. The children of the working people have gained broad opportunities for education. Kang Keqing emphasized that the Chinese people have achieved peace and freedom at the cost of unparalleled sacrifice and suffering. We cherish peace very much and are determined to defend peace with all our strength. For the peace and happiness of children, we demand an immediate end to the Korean War and a ban on atomic and bacteriological weapons. We demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact.

    Sudanese representative Mahonmed described the tragic situation of the Sudanese people, saying that the child mortality rate there is as high as 50 percent. Only 1 percent of the population receives medical care; there is only one doctor for every 10,000 people. Ninety-eight percent of the people are illiterate. All of this is the result of imperialist rule in Sudan.

    Greek writer Alexiou described the plight of Greek children, saying that terror and hunger are the fate of the Greek people and children. Juvenile prisons hold 15,000 children, who are being tortured and slowly dying. Two-thirds of the Greek budget is used for war preparations, while the amount spent on education is negligible. There are very few schools in the country, and even the few remaining schools are gradually being dissolved. Alexiou emphasized that our conference must set out measures to strengthen the struggle against the new war instigators, against fascism, and for the happy future of our children.

    The next speaker was Kim Young-sook, Vice-Chairwoman of the Korean Democratic Women's League. She accused the American demons of turning Korean cities and villages into ruins. They drove children, women, and the elderly into granaries and burned them to death. They buried civilians alive and committed other heinous crimes. Kim Young-sook said angrily: Now, the American cannibals have also used bacteriological weapons. However, no matter how vicious these means are, the American interventionists cannot shake the Korean people's confidence in victory. We want to solemnly demand here once again: Americans, get out of Korea! Kim Young-sook's speech received prolonged applause from the audience.

    At the afternoon session, Cavalieri, Deputy Head of the Investigation Team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, spoke first, recounting the brutal crimes committed by the American imperialists in Korea. He said that undeniable facts prove that the Americans are using bacteriological weapons on a large scale in Korea and China. We must accuse the American interventionists, who are launching a war of aggression in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, of the monstrous crimes they have committed against humanity before the people of the world. We believe that the criminals will not escape just punishment.

    Iranian representative Bolgei pointed out in his speech that due to preparations for war, the poverty and hunger of the Iranian people are becoming increasingly serious, various diseases are very prevalent, and 85 percent of children die tragically before the age of fifteen. Eighty-five percent of the country's population is illiterate. Only 10 percent of children can attend school, and the rest are forced to work as child laborers in order to survive or wander the streets and become child beggars. Bolgei said that the Iranian people are against war. They want bread, not cannons. We must do our best to save our children from war and hunger.

    Soviet representative Baffinova spoke amid warm applause, recounting the Soviet government's and people's deep concern for children. She said that all children in the Soviet Union attend school. Soviet children are raised in a spirit of peace and friendship with other nations. The population reproduction rate in capitalist countries is constantly decreasing, and the mortality rate is increasing. But the Soviet Union is just the opposite. The Soviet Union now adds three million people every year. The birth of a baby is a great joy for every mother and family in the Soviet Union. Baffinova emphasized that we must unite all forces to eliminate the threat of a new world war that the American imperialists are planning to launch; we must demand the production of books and tractors instead of bombs and tanks; we must demand that governments stop expanding their armaments, reduce military spending, and increase allocations for health care, education, and maternal and child welfare, and that they agree to the demand to conclude a five-power peace pact. We must protest the bacteriological war being waged in Korea and demand a ban on atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    German Democratic Republic representative Menzel pointed out that in West Germany, large amounts of money are spent on re-militarization, while allocations for education and health care are being cut. The situation in the German Democratic Republic is completely opposite to that in West Germany. According to the Five-Year Plan, 280 million marks have been allocated for the construction of schools alone. Last year, 100 million marks were allocated for scholarships and teaching subsidies. There are thousands of schools, kindergartens, clubs, and theaters throughout the country.

    Representatives from France, Brazil, Poland, India, Tunisia, Vietnam, Argentina, and other countries also spoke at the meeting that day.

    国际保卫儿童大会继续举行会议
    康克清报告我国儿童福利情况
    卡瓦莱里控诉美国侵略者进行细菌战
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际保卫儿童大会十四日会议，继续讨论报告，并听取了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团副团长卡瓦莱里关于美帝国主义者进行细菌战的报告。
    上午会议首由中国代表康克清发言。她说：在中国历史上，母亲和儿童的权利第一次得到保障。全国已设立了接生站一万多处，农村中旧式接产人员已有十一万多人受到了科学的助产教育。各地普遍设立了幼儿园、托儿所和休养所。去年农忙托儿所的数目比前年增加了一百零六倍。这一切使得千百万妇女能积极地参加国家的政治、文化和经济生活。目前中国入学儿童的数目，已超过国民党统治时期最高水平的一九四六年的百分之五十六。劳动人民的子女获得广大的求学机会。康克清强调指出：中国人民以无比的牺牲和苦难为代价，取得了和平与自由。我们非常珍爱和平，并决心以全部力量来保卫和平。为了儿童们的和平和幸福，我们要求马上停止朝鲜战争，禁止原子武器和细菌武器。我们要求五大国缔结和平公约。
    苏丹代表马洪麦德在会上叙述苏丹人民的惨况说：那里的儿童死亡率高达百分之五十。只有百分之一的人口得到医药照顾；每一万人里才有一个医生。人民百分之九十八是文盲。
    这一切都是帝国主义统治苏丹的结果。
    希腊女作家阿列克修描述希腊儿童的遭遇说：恐怖和饥饿是希腊人民和儿童的命运。少年监狱里关着一万五千名儿童，他们正在受着折磨慢慢地死去。希腊预算的三分之二用于战争准备，而用在教育方面的数目微不足道。全国的学校少得可怜，甚至残存下来的少数学校现在也逐渐解散了。阿列克修强调说，我们的大会必须订出措施，以加强斗争，反对新战争挑拨者，反对法西斯主义，争取我们儿女的幸福前途。
    接着发言的是朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长金荣淑。她控诉美国恶魔把朝鲜的城市和村庄变成废墟。他们把儿童、妇女和老弱的人赶到粮仓里烧死。他们活埋平民，并干着其他万恶不赦的罪行。金荣淑愤怒地说：现在，美国吃人生番又使用了细菌武器。可是，不论这一切手段怎样毒辣，美国干涉者决不能动摇朝鲜人对胜利的信心。我们要在这里再一次严正要求：美国人，滚出朝鲜去！金荣淑的发言获得了全场历久不息的掌声。
    在下午会议上，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团副团长卡瓦莱里首先发言，历述美帝国主义者在朝鲜所犯的凶暴的罪行。他说：无可置辩的事实证明了美国人正在朝鲜和中国大规模使用细菌武器。我们要在全世界人民的面前，控诉打着联合国的旗帜在朝鲜发动侵略战争的美国干涉者对人类所犯下的滔天罪行。我们相信罪犯们将不能逃避公正的惩罚。
    伊朗代表波尔盖在发言时指出：由于准备战争，伊朗人民的贫困和饥饿的境况正日益严重，各种疾病非常流行，百分之八十五的儿童在十五岁以前就惨遭夭折。全国人口中百分之八十五是文盲。只有百分之十的儿童能进学校读书，其余则为了生活而被迫做童工，或者流浪街头，沦为童丐。波尔盖说：伊朗人民是反对战争的。他们要面包而不要大炮。我们必须尽力把我们的儿童从战争和饥饿中拯救出来。
    苏联代表巴菲诺娃在热烈掌声中发言，叙述苏联政府和人民对儿童的深切关怀。她说：苏联所有的儿童都进了学校。苏联儿童是在和平及与其他民族友好的精神中教养出来的。资本主义国家的人口繁殖率在不断降低、死亡率在提高。但苏联则恰恰相反，苏联现在每年都增加三百万人口。婴儿的诞生对于苏联每一个母亲和家庭都是极大的快乐。巴菲诺娃强调说：我们必须团结一切力量来消除美国帝国主义者在打算发动的新世界大战的威胁；必须要求出产书籍和拖拉机以代替炸弹和战车；必须要求各国政府停止扩张军备，并且削减军费，增加保健事业、教育、妇婴福利的拨款，要它们同意缔结五大国和平公约的要求。我们必须抗议在朝鲜进行的细菌战，并要求禁止原子武器、化学武器、细菌武器和其他大规模屠杀人类的武器。
    德意志民主共和国代表孟塞尔发言指出：在西德，大量经费耗于重新军国主义化，而教育和保健事业的拨款却在削减。德意志民主共和国和西德的情形完全相反，按照五年计划规定，单是建筑学校就拨款二亿八千万马克。去年曾拨款一亿马克作为奖学金和教学补助金。全国有数千所学校、幼儿园、俱乐部和剧院。
    这一天在会议上发言的，还有法国、巴西、波兰、印度、突尼斯、越南、阿根廷和其他国家的代表。
