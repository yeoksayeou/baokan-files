On April 1st, joyous conversations could be heard everywhere on the streets and in the stores of Moscow:

"Prices have been reduced again. This is the fifth time!"

"This price reduction makes our lives even better."

"Thank you to the Party and the government, thank you Comrade Stalin! We must work even harder."

The good news of the price reduction aroused jubilation and pride among the Soviet people. They rejoiced at the further strengthening of their country's economic power and at the further improvement of their lives; they were proud of the fruitful results brought about by their peaceful labor.

We entered many food stores. Crowded with people, they were enthusiastically buying all kinds of food, which were 10 to 30 percent cheaper than yesterday. The best white bread in the bakery, which cost four rubles per kilogram yesterday, now only costs three rubles and forty kopecks (one ruble is worth one hundred kopecks). Rice in the grain store, which cost eleven rubles and fifty kopecks per kilogram yesterday, now only costs nine rubles and eighty kopecks; white sugar, which cost eleven rubles and fifty kopecks per kilogram yesterday, now only costs ten rubles and forty kopecks. Top-quality beef in the meat and dairy store, which cost twenty rubles and fifty kopecks per kilogram yesterday, now only costs seventeen rubles and sixty kopecks; top-quality pork, which cost twenty-nine rubles and forty kopecks per kilogram yesterday, now only costs twenty-five rubles and twenty kopecks; medium-grade butter, which cost thirty-five rubles and twenty kopecks per kilogram yesterday, now only costs twenty-nine rubles and ninety kopecks. ...

Like the previous price reductions, this price reduction in the Soviet Union brings huge and intimate benefits to the people. In the No. 34 food store in the Moscow River District, Maria Kondukova, a female worker at the Ilyich Factory, said: "After the fifth price reduction today, we will have a surplus of 150 to 200 rubles per month in our family budget. That is to say, we can eat even better." Meshkov Nikolai, a fitter at the Moscow Small Car Factory, earns 1,100 to 1,200 rubles per month. His wife, Anna Georgievna, is an economic worker and earns about 1,000 rubles per month. She said: "Every day we buy meat, butter, sugar, and white bread. The rent and utility bills account for only 4 percent of our wages. The rest is used to buy things. Now our family budget has increased by 15 percent. That is to say, we will live even better."

One of the features of this price reduction is the reduction in book prices. We know that illiteracy has long been eliminated in the Soviet Union, and reading and buying books is a common phenomenon among Soviet people. Therefore, the excitement that the reduction in book prices brings to people is imaginable. On the first day of the price reduction, we also entered many bookstores. These spiritual food supply stations, which are usually no less crowded than department stores, were even more crowded with customers on this day. People bought bags of books. Higher education textbooks, medical books, etc., were reduced by 20 percent; books from local publishers were reduced by 30 to 40 percent: the average reduction for all books was 18 percent.

In the suggestion book of Bookstore No. 2, we saw the following words: "The reduction in book prices, especially textbook prices, is a sign of the Party and the government's concern for young students. This will help to further increase the welfare of university students. Thank you to the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin. -- G. Uvorov, student at Moscow University." The family of A. Potskov, a steelworker at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory, all like to read. In the first three months of this year alone, they bought 300 rubles worth of books, including the complete works of Gorky, the new edition of Tolstoy's "War and Peace," a collection of short stories by Ukrainian writers, a collection of Bulgarian stories, and works that won the Stalin Prize, etc. He said: "Reducing book prices will allow us to get more books and increase our own libraries."

Like previous price reductions, this reduction in state retail prices for food has affected market prices. In the Soviet Union, there are two types of trade networks: the main one is the state and cooperative stores, which sell goods at uniform prices set by the state or cooperatives; the second is the collective farm and collective farmer markets, where collective farms and individual collective farmers sell their own directly produced goods, mainly food, at prices determined by supply and demand. These market prices are always influenced by the prices of the state-owned trade network, which occupies a major and leading position. On the first day of the price reduction, food prices in various markets in Moscow were on average 10 to 12 percent lower than yesterday, and some dairy products, such as cottage cheese and milk skin, were reduced by 15 percent.

The fifth price reduction, which was created by the Soviet people's efforts in industry and agriculture in 1951, especially in improving labor productivity and reducing production costs, will benefit themselves 2.3 billion rubles a year from the state-owned trade network, and 500 million rubles a year from the collective farm and cooperative trade network, for a total benefit of 2.8 billion rubles per year.

The repeated price reductions in the Soviet Union and the increasingly better lives of the Soviet people cannot but remind people of the tragic situation of the working people in capitalist countries.

Taking food prices and the cost of living as an example. In the United States, from the beginning of 1950 to October 1951, retail food prices rose by 21.4 percent, and the cost of living increased by 20 percent. At least three-quarters of families live below the minimum subsistence level; of these, 22.9 percent of families have incomes less than one-quarter of what is needed to maintain the minimum subsistence level, and 13.7 percent of families have incomes less than one-eighth of what is needed to maintain the minimum subsistence level. In the United Kingdom, food prices rose by 15 percent in 1951, and the cost of living increased by a quarter. In France, flour prices rose by 48 percent in 1951, bread rose by 38 percent, and vegetable oil and sugar rose by 23 percent; since August 15, 1951, the cost of living has increased by 15.6 percent. In Italy, the cost of living in 1951 was 15 percent higher than in 1950. In West Germany, prices rose by one-half in 1951; in West Berlin, flour prices rose by 36.1 percent in March 1952, potatoes rose by 46.3 percent, and white bread rose by 15.3 percent. In Japan, wheat prices rose by 20 percent from August to October 1951; the cost of living has increased by 28 percent in a year and a half. The above are mostly officially announced figures that have been obviously reduced. Moreover, it is only a part of the evil consequences that the expansion of armaments and aggression by the American and British imperialist blocs have brought to the people of capitalist countries.

People can see very clearly here: the socialist Soviet Union, which is committed to peaceful construction, brings happiness to the people; the American and British imperialist countries, which are frantically expanding armaments and carrying out aggression, bring disaster to the people.

### 苏联第五次减低物价

    苏联第五次减低物价
  　新华社驻莫斯科记者　李何
    四月一日，莫斯科街道上、商店里到处听到愉快的谈话：
    “又减低物价了。这是第五次啊！”
    “这次减低物价使我们生活得更好了。”
    “感谢党和政府，感谢斯大林同志！我们一定要更好地劳动。”
    减低物价的喜讯，引起了苏联人的欢腾和自豪。他们为自己国家经济力量的更加雄厚、为自己生活的更加美好而欢腾；他们以自己和平劳动所带来的硕果而自豪。
    我们走进了许多食品商店。拥挤的人们兴致勃勃地购买着比昨天减价了百分之十到三十的各式食品。面包店里的上等白面包，昨天每公斤四卢布，今天只要三卢布四十戈比了（按一卢布值一百个戈比）。粮食店里的大米，昨天每公斤十一卢布五十戈比，今天只要九卢布八十戈比了；白糖昨天每公斤十一卢布五十戈比，今天只要十卢布四十戈比了。肉类和乳制品商店里的上等牛肉昨天每公斤二十卢布五十戈比，今天只要十七卢布六十戈比了；上等猪肉昨天每公斤二十九卢布四十戈比，今天只要二十五卢布二十戈比了；中等奶油昨天每公斤三十五卢布二十戈比，今天只要二十九卢布九十戈比了。……
    像各次减低物价一样，苏联这次减低物价带给人民的利益，是巨大而亲切的。在莫斯科河区第三十四号食品商店里，伊里奇工厂女工玛丽亚·康都科娃说：“今天第五次减价以后，我们家庭预算中每月将盈余一百五十到二百卢布。就是说，可以吃得更好。”莫斯科小型汽车工厂的钳工麦什科夫·尼古莱每月工资一千一百到一千二百卢布。他的妻子安娜·吉奥吉耶甫娜是经济工作人员，每月工资约一千卢布。她说：“每天我们买肉、奶油、糖、白面包。付的房租和水电费不过工资的百分之四。余下的就用来购买东西。现在我们家庭预算中，收入增加了百分之十五。这就是说，我们将生活得更好。”
    这次减低物价中的一个特色，是书价的减低。我们知道，苏联文盲早已消灭，喜欢读书和买书是苏联人的普遍现象。所以减低书价带给人们的兴奋，是可想而知的。在这次减价的第一天，我们也走进了许多书店。在这些平常拥挤程度不下于百货商店的精神粮食供应站里，这一天更挤满了顾客。人们买走了一包包书籍。高等学校教科书、医学书等减价百分之二十；各地方出版社的书籍减价百分之三十到四十：所有书籍平均减价百分之十八。
    在第二号书店的意见簿上，我们看到这样的字句：“减低书价，特别是教科书价格，是党和政府关心青年学生的标志。这将帮助进一步增进大学生的福利。感谢党、政府和斯大林同志。——莫斯科大学学生格·乌沃罗夫”。“锤子与镰刀”工厂炼钢工人亚·波茨科夫一家都喜欢读书。仅仅今年头三月他们就买了三百卢布的书籍，包括高尔基全集、新版的托尔斯泰的“战争与和平”、乌克兰作家短篇小说集、保加利亚故事集、获得斯大林奖金的作品等等。他说：“减低书价将使我们得到更多的书籍，增加自己的图书。”
    像历次减低物价一样，这次食品国家零售价格的减低，影响到市场物价的减低。在苏联，有两种贸易网：主要的一种是国家和合作社的商店，它们按照国家或合作社规定的统一价格出卖物品；其次的一种是集体农场和集体农民的市场，在那里，集体农场和集体农民个人按照供求关系所造成的价格，出卖自己直接生产的物品，主要是食品。这种市场价格总是在居于主要和领导地位的国营贸易网的价格的影响之下的。在减低物价的第一天，莫斯科各个市场的食品价格，平均比昨天减价百分之十到十二，有些乳制品，如牛奶渣、牛奶皮，减价百分之十五。
    苏联人民一九五一年在工、农业方面的努力，特别是在提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本方面的努力，所造成的第五次减低物价，将使自己一年从国营贸易网方面得益二十三亿卢布，从集体农场和合作社的贸易网方面一年得益五亿卢布，这样每年一共将得益二十八亿卢布。
    苏联物价一次又一次减低，苏联人民生活一天比一天美好，这不能不使人联想到资本主义各国劳动人民的悲惨情景。
    仅以食品价格和生活费来说。在美国，从一九五○年初到一九五一年十月，食品的零售价格涨了百分之二十一点四，生活费提高了百分之二十。最少有四分之三的家庭生活在最低生活水平线之下；其中百分之二十二点九家庭的收入不及维持最低生活水平所需要的四分之一，百分之十三点七家庭的收入不及维持最低生活水平所需要的八分之一。在英国，一九五一年中食品的价格涨了百分之十五，生活费提高了四分之一。在法国，一九五一年面粉价格涨了百分之四十八，面包涨了百分之三十八，植物油和糖涨了百分之二十三；从一九五一年八月十五日以来生活费就提高了百分之十五点六。在意大利，一九五一年生活费比一九五○年提高了百分之十五。西德一九五一年物价涨了二分之一；在西柏林，一九五二年三月面粉价格涨了百分之三十六点一，洋芋涨了百分之四十六点三，白面包涨了百分之十五点三。在日本，从一九五一年八月到十月小麦价格涨了百分之二十；一年半来生活费提高了百分之二十八。以上多半是官方宣布的显然缩小了的数字。而且它只是美、英帝国主义集团扩张军备和进行侵略所带给资本主义各国人民的恶果的一部分。
    人们在这里可以看得很清楚：致力于和平建设的社会主义苏联，给人民带来的是幸福；疯狂地扩张军备和进行侵略的美、英帝国主义国家，给人民带来的是灾难。
