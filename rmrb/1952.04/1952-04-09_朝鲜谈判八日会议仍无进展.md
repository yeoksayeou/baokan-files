Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 8th: On April 8th, during the subcommittee meeting of the third item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks, our side pointed out that, because the other side insisted on the unreasonable demand to restrict the construction of airport facilities within Korea, and refused to withdraw this demand to interfere in our internal affairs at the staff meeting, our side proposed convening a subcommittee to resolve the so-called restriction of airport facilities issue together with the issue of nominating neutral nations. However, the other side stated at the meeting on the 8th that they still had no new proposals, and the meeting made no progress.

    朝鲜谈判八日会议仍无进展
    【新华社开城八日电】八日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方指出，由于对方坚持限制朝鲜境内机场设备的修建的无理要求，并拒绝在参谋会议上撤消这一干涉我方内政的要求，因此我方提议召开小组委员会，将所谓限制机场设备问题与中立国提名问题一并解决。但对方在八日会上，仍然表示并无任何新的建议，会议无进展。
