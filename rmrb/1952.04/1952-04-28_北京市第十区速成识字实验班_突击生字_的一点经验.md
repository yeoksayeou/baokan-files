Some Experiences from the "Cramming Characters" of the Beijing Tenth District Quick Literacy Experimental Class
Wu Qin

    In late March, the Tenth District of Beijing established several quick literacy experimental classes for workers, farmers, and citizens to promote the "Quick Literacy Method" created by Qi Jianhua. After six to ten hours of teaching phonetic symbols and pinyin, each experimental class proceeded to teach a large number of "crammed characters," achieving great results. According to statistics, workers crammed 1,800 characters in 38 hours; farmers crammed 1,638 characters in 48 hours; and citizens, due to their lighter workload, crammed 1,800 characters in 28 hours. Workers and farmers adopted a volume-by-volume cramming method, spending 16 to 20 hours reading textbooks and practicing new characters; the after-class review time was roughly equal to the teaching time.

    "Cramming characters" is the most intense stage of quick literacy teaching, requiring both teachers and students to concentrate their energy. Because the experimental classes were established based on the successful experiment in Gaobeidian, students knew that the quick literacy method was effective, but they were still skeptical about whether they could learn it themselves; therefore, it is necessary to fully explain the superiority of the quick literacy method and encourage students' confidence in learning. Sometimes, learning is also affected by old teaching methods, such as doubts like: "Just recognizing, not writing, will it work?"
    "What if the pronunciation is sometimes inaccurate?" Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the teaching characteristics of the quick literacy method and the reasons why it can be quickly learned, to strengthen the students' belief in learning. Secondly, teachers should have a good grasp of the teaching principle of going from easy to difficult. For example, in the first two or three days, teach familiar characters first, so that they are familiar with the method of using phonetic symbols to recognize characters. No more than one hundred characters a day, so that students do not feel difficult. Because workers, farmers, and citizens are all studying in their spare time, they have production work and housework, and their thoughts are not easy to concentrate. If there is less review time, which makes their learning difficult, they will often shrink back in the face of difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to frequently "take stock" (summarize learning) so that they can see their achievements. In addition, the power of group mutual assistance should also be brought into play so that students who are behind in their studies can get timely help. Students should also be organized to correspond with each other and hold forums. When individual students in the Dongba farmers' class were in low spirits, they would ask students with good grades to introduce their experiences in overcoming difficulties to everyone.

    The two-hour teaching time each day is generally used to cram one hundred to one hundred and forty characters, with a maximum of one hundred and seventy-seven characters (citizens). Learning is divided into two sessions, with more characters crammed in the first session and fewer in the second. The teaching process is: the teacher leads the students to pronounce the words two or three times, explains them once; then pronounce them one or two more times, and read them without the phonetic symbols once; some students also have to explain them once. After teaching six or seventy characters in this way for fifteen to twenty minutes, the group spends fifteen to thirty minutes practicing. The method is that the head of the study group leads the students to pronounce and explain the words one or two times, and then recognize the characters without the phonetic symbols. Finally, the teacher spends five to ten minutes calling on the students to take turns reading (without the phonetic symbols), or the teacher leads the students to read them once. After two hours of after-class review, most of the students can memorize all the new characters.

    In addition to relying on phonetic symbols, students mainly use explanations of character forms and associations with character meanings to memorize characters. If teachers are good at guiding students to use these two methods, they can accelerate the process of students dropping phonetic symbols and improve the speed of character recognition. Before using these two methods, the Xin Si Village farmers' class learned 102 characters per day, and only nine out of 25 people could recognize all of them, with the whole class averaging only 94 characters completed; after using these two methods, 19 people could learn all the characters every day, averaging 100 characters completed. A student named Wang Shuzhen in Dongba could only recognize 13 out of 130 characters at first, but after grasping these two methods, she increased to recognizing 113 characters, and eventually could recognize all of them.

    Explaining character forms is the most popular method of memorizing characters among students; but this is mainly applicable to relatively obvious pictographic, phonetic-semantic, and ideographic characters. For example, the character "尖" (jiān, sharp) is said to be "small on top and big on the bottom is sharp"; "剥削" (bō xuē, exploitation) both have a "立刀" (lì dāo, standing knife radical), saying that landlords exploit poor people as if scraping them with a knife; the character "哭" (kū, cry) looks like two eyes crying out tears; such explanations are very effective for students to memorize characters. However, attention should also be paid to radicals, components, and similar characters, preferably using comparative and differentiating methods, such as "炕, 坑, 抗" (kàng, pit, resist); "贷, 货" (dài, huò, loan, goods); "我, 找" (wǒ, zhǎo, I, find); "砂, 纱, 炒" (shā, shā, chǎo, sand, yarn, stir-fry); "抬, 扒, 控" (tái, bā, kòng, lift, rake, control), etc. Students remember the characters that have been analyzed and compared firmly. But it must be noted: do not explain too complicatedly, and do not give too many characters at once.

    Explaining the meaning of characters enables students to see the form of the character, associate it with the meaning of the character, and pronounce the sound of the character. For example, a student named Liu Xiulan said: "When I see the character, I think of '讲' (jiǎng, speak), and when I think of '讲,' I know what to read it." The citizen class teacher explained "膨" (péng) as "膨胀" (péng zhàng, expansion); "霞" (xiá) as "晚霞" (wǎn xiá, sunset glow), but the students always couldn't remember them. Later, some students realized that "膨 is the 膨 of 膨闷胀饱 (péng mèn zhàng bǎo, bulging, stuffy, swollen, full)"; "霞 is the fire clouds"; as soon as they said this, they all remembered it. The teacher in the tricycle worker class explained the character "补" (bǔ, mend) as "补衣服" (bǔ yī fu, mend clothes), but the students said it was the "补" of "补车带" (bǔ chē dài, patching tires); the teacher said the character "理" (lǐ, manage) was "修理" (xiū lǐ, repair), but the barbers thought it was the "理" of "理发" (lǐ fà, haircut). It is clear from this that explaining in plain language and connecting with things that students are familiar with is the most helpful for memory, so teachers must use fewer intellectual vocabularies; understand students and learn from students. But at the same time, attention should also be paid to preventing the one-sidedness, narrowness, and vulgarization of explaining the meaning of words. For example, explaining the character "祖" (zǔ, ancestor) as "祖宗" (zǔ zong, ancestors) is not as good as explaining it as "祖国" (zǔ guó, motherland). The conciseness of explaining characters is also very important. A teacher in Gaobeidian explained the character "布" (bù, cloth) by first pulling on the student's clothes and asking "What is this?" The student said "棉袄" (mián ǎo, cotton-padded jacket); then asked "What is the cotton-padded jacket made of?" Only then did he get to the character "布". Such circumlocution is unnecessary. If the explanation cannot help memory, it can be omitted, such as explaining "埃" (āi) as "埃及" (Āi jí, Egypt); "者" (zhě) as "之乎者也" (zhī hū zhě yě, classical Chinese particles); students asked what "埃及" is? What is "之乎者也?"; Instead of adding to the burden, it is better not to explain it, but to let them remember the shape of the character more. Characters that can be linked into words, such as "革命" (gé mìng, revolution), "茶碗" (chá wǎn, teacup), "囉嗦" (luō suō, verbose), etc., should be taught together, which can avoid the trouble of explanation and facilitate memory. However, one should prevent the tendency of not carefully distinguishing the shape of the character due to associating the meaning of the character, so as to avoid confusion after leaving the character list. Therefore, the words that can be connected into words should be read backwards, sideways, around, and randomly. In addition, adopt some lively and active methods, such as explaining the character "器" (qì, utensil) as "一家四口对面坐，一个小狗当间卧" (yī jiā sì kǒu duì miàn zuò, yī gè xiǎo gǒu dāng jiān wò, a family of four sits facing each other, with a little dog lying in the middle). These are all good methods.

    The creative methods of memorizing characters by students are worth collecting and promoting. For example, the student Peng Changshan remembered the character "收" (shōu, receive) as the phonetic symbols "丩," "ㄥ," and "ㄨ"; the student Zhang Xiuqing said: "When I remember the character 枣 (zǎo, jujube), I think of the jujube tree in my house." Some students also said: "Give the character a master and you can remember it quickly!" They also said: "Don't memorize it by rote, be flexible and you will remember it!" But this should also be guided. For example, when the student Chen Bin learned the character "突" (tū, sudden), he remembered it by touching the bald spot on his head; the student Chen Xiuhong said: "I can't remember the character '姓' (xìng, surname), but when I think of the apricot tree in my house, I remember it." This method of associating the sound of the character must be combined with distinguishing the meaning of the character, otherwise it will lead to too many typos in writing.

    Review is an important condition to ensure the teaching effect. Citizens are relatively idle, and some can review for up to three hours, so the progress is faster and the results are better; farmers are very busy with production and live scattered, so the results are poor, so extra attention should be paid to combining spare time learning with production. For example, the tricycle workers' learning mutual aid group should set a parking location and time for gathering to review; the farmers' wives who often do embroidery work together (a sideline in the suburbs of Beijing) should be organized into a learning mutual aid group; when farmers in Xin Si Village dug drainage ditches, the work areas were divided according to learning mutual aid groups, and they studied together during breaks; This solves the contradiction between learning and production and completes the learning task.

    The crammed characters are not solid, and both teachers and students must prevent complacency. After the final review test, it is necessary to immediately move on to the stage of extensive reading, moving from this victory to a new victory, and only in the new victory can the victory of "cramming characters" be consolidated.

    北京市第十区速成识字实验班“突击生字”的一点经验
    吴琴
    北京市第十区为了推广祁建华创造的“速成识字法”，三月下旬在工人、农民、市民中开办了几个速成识字实验班。各实验班经过六到十小时的注音符号和拼音教学以后，即进行大量“突击生字”的教学，得到了很大的成绩。据统计，工人用三十八小时突击了一千八百字；农民用四十八小时突击了一千六百三十八个字；市民由于本身的工作较轻，在二十八小时内就突击了一千八百字。工人、农民是采用分册突击的办法，其中用十六到二十小时阅读课本，练习生字；课后的复习时间大体上和教学时间相等。
    “突击生字”是速成识字教学中最紧张的一个阶段，教员、学员都必须集中精力来进行。由于实验班是在高碑店实验成功的基础上开办的，学员都知道速成识字法有效，但对于自己能否学成还是半信半疑的；所以必须充分说明速成识字法的优越性，并鼓励学员的学习自信心。学习中有时也受旧教学方法的影响，如怀疑：“只是认，不写，能顶事吗？”
    “拼出音来有时不准确该怎么办呢？”因而，必须反复地讲解速成识字法的教学特点和能够速成的原因，以坚定学员的学习信念。其次是教师应当很好地掌握由易到难的教学原则，如前两三天先教熟字，使他们熟悉利用注音符号识字的方法。每天不超过一百字，使学员不觉得困难。因为工人、农民、市民都是业余学习，他们有生产工作，有家务，思想不易集中，假如复习时间少，使他们的学习发生困难，他们便往往要畏难退缩。因此，要经常地“算账”（总结学习），使他们能看到自己的成绩。此外，还应当发挥小组互助的力量，使学习差的学员能及时得到帮助。还应该组织学员互相通信、举行座谈。东坝农民班在个别学员学习情绪低落时，便请成绩好的学员向大家介绍克服困难的经验。
    每天两小时的教学时间，一般是突击一百到一百四十个字，最高达一百七十七个字（市民）。学习是分两节进行的，第一节突击的字数较多，第二节较少。教学过程是：教师领着拼读二、三遍，讲一遍；再拼读一、二遍，丢开注音符号读一遍；有的学员还要回讲一遍，这样用十五到二十分钟教六、七十个字以后，小组即用十五到三十分钟的时间进行练习。方法是学习小组长领着拼读和讲解一、二遍，然后就丢开注音符号认字，最后由教师用五分到十分钟的时间再指名叫学员接力读（丢开注音符号），或由教师领读一遍。这样再经过课后二小时的复习，大部分学员就能把生字全部认下了。
    学员记字的方法，除依靠注音符号外，主要借助讲解字形和联想字义。如果教师善于引导学员利用这两个方法，就能使学员加速丢掉注音符号，提高认字速度。辛四村农民班学员在没有运用这两个方法以前，每天学一百零二个字，二十五人中只有九人能全部认下，全班平均只完成九十四个字的学习任务；运用这两个方法以后，每天就有十九人全部能学会，平均完成一百个字的学习任务。东坝有个学员叫王淑珍，最初学一百三十个字只能认会十三个，但抓住这两个方法以后，就增加到认识一百一十三个，以至全部能认。
    讲解字形是最受学员欢迎的记字方法；但这主要适用于比较明显的象形、形声、会意一类的字。如把“尖”字说成“上小下大是尖的”；“剥削”都有立刀，说地主剥削穷人像用刀子刮似的；“哭”字好像是两眼哭出眼泪来的样子；这样的讲解对学员记字很起作用。但还应注意偏旁、部首、相似的字，最好用比较分辨的方法，如“炕、坑、抗”；“贷、货”；“我、找”；“砂、纱、炒”；“抬、扒、控”等。凡是经过分析比较的字，学员都记得牢固。但必须注意：不可讲得太复杂，也不要一下子举出太多的字。
    讲解字义能使学员看到字形、联想字义、读出字音。如学员柳秀兰说：“我看到了字，就想起了‘讲’，想起‘讲’来就知道念什么。”市民班教员讲“膨”字为“膨胀”；“霞”为“晚霞”，学员总记不住。后来有的学员领会到“膨是膨闷胀饱的膨”；“霞是火烧云”；这样一说就都记住了。“补”字在三轮工人班教师讲为“补衣服”，学员说是补车带的“补”；“理”字教师说是“修理”，理发工人认为是理发的“理”。由此可见，讲解通俗、联系学员熟习的事物，是最能帮助记忆的，因而教师必须少用知识分子的语汇；了解学员，向学员学习。但同时也要注意防止讲解字义的片面性、狭隘性和庸俗化。如“祖”字讲为“祖宗”就不如讲作“祖国”。讲字的简明也是很重要的，高碑店有位教师讲“布”字，先拉着学员的衣服问“这是什么”？学员说是“棉袄”；又问“棉袄是什么做的”？这样才说到“布”字。如此绕圈子是不必要的。讲了不能帮助记忆的可以不讲，如“埃”讲为“埃及”；“者”讲为“之乎者也”；学员问什么叫“埃及”？什么叫“之乎者也”；反倒加重负担，不如不讲，而叫他们多记字形。能联接成词的字如“革命”、“茶碗”、“囉嗦”等，应排在一起教，这可以免去讲解的麻烦并便于记忆。但应防止由于联想字义而不认真分辨字形的偏向，以免脱离字表后发生混淆不清的现象。所以，能连接成词的要倒念、横念、转弯念、乱点着念。此外采取一些生动活泼的方式，如“器”字讲为“一家四口对面坐，一个小狗当间卧”。这都是很好的办法。
    学员创造性的记字方法是值得注意搜集、和推广的，如学员彭常山记“收”字为注音符号的“丩”“ㄥ”“ㄨ”；学员张秀清说：“我记枣字就想我家的枣树。”还有些学员说：“给字找个主儿就记得快！”又说：“别死记，灵活一点就记住了！”但这也应当注意指导，如学员陈彬学“突”字时是摸自己头上的秃疤记住的；学员陈秀红说：“我记不住‘姓’字，一想家里的杏树就记住了。”这种联想字音的方法，必须和分辨字义结合起来，否则将形成写作上别字过多的现象。
    复习是保证教学效果的重要条件。市民较闲，有的能复习到三小时，因而进度较快，成绩也好；农民生产很忙，居住分散，成绩较差，所以业余学习要特别注意和生产结合。如要三轮车工人的学习互助组定好停车地点、时间集合复习；把常在一起做绣活（北京郊区的副业）的农妇编成一个学习互助组；辛四村农民挖泄水沟时，按学习互助组划分工作地段，休息时一齐学习；这样就解决了学习和生产矛盾的问题，完成了学习任务。
    突击的生字是不巩固的，不论教员、学员都要防止自满的思想，总复习测验后，必须急转直下地进入大量阅读的阶段，从这个胜利走向新的胜利，也只有在新的胜利中，才能巩固“突击生字”的胜利。
