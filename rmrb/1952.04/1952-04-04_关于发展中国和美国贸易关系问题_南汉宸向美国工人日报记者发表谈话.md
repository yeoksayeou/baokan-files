Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference, met with Clark, a Moscow correspondent for the American "Daily Worker," on March 31st and made the following statement on the issue of developing trade relations between China and the United States:

    Question: Is there a possibility of developing trade between the United States and China?

    Answer: I believe that trade between China and the United States has a long history, and in the future, it can not only be restored but also further expanded. On October 1, 1949, when the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established, Chairman Mao Zedong clearly announced to the governments of all countries: "This government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that is willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." We have always upheld lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates the policy of "restoring and developing commercial and trade relations with the governments and people of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, there was a period when trade between China and the United States developed considerably. The figures were not only no less than before liberation but also began to show a trend of exceeding them. This is enough to prove that trade between the new China and the United States can not only be restored but is also fully equipped with the conditions to exceed it.

    Question: Why might the new China do more business with the United States than the old China?

    Answer: The scale of the new China's international trade will inevitably exceed that of the old China. In fact, it has not only exceeded that before liberation but also exceeded that before World War II. Because the peasants of the new China have obtained land, and with the unprecedented increase in the peasants' enthusiasm for production, the purchasing power of the peasants is also gradually increasing. The gradual increase in the purchasing power of nearly 500 million people has made the domestic market unprecedentedly large. Therefore, China needs to import a large amount of industrial equipment, materials, industrial raw materials, chemical raw materials, and industrial products to meet the needs of the people. At the same time, China has a large number of agricultural products, livestock products, and handicrafts that can supply the needs of the people of various countries. Therefore, the scale of the new China's international trade has far exceeded that of the old China and is continuing to develop.

    Question: At present, trade between the United States and China has stagnated due to political reasons. Is there any possibility of restoring it in the future?

    Answer: The stagnation of trade between the United States and China is entirely the result of the US government's implementation of blockades and embargoes. The US government, disregarding the wishes and needs of the American people, imposed blockades and embargoes on China after engaging in the war of intervention in Korea and occupying China's Taiwan. As a result, American industrialists, businessmen, and farmers have lost a vast, lasting, and reliable market of nearly 500 million people, and the crisis in civilian industry and commerce is deepening. Therefore, US official Brooks cannot but admit: "The fear and impatience of American businessmen with this set of embargo laws are fully understandable." (American "Foreign Trade Weekly," December 11, 1951) We believe that the efforts of the American people to urge the US government to lift the blockade and embargo measures to restore Sino-US trade are completely justified. If the US government can lift the blockade and embargo, trade between China and the United States can be immediately restored and developed.

    关于发展中国和美国贸易关系问题
    南汉宸向美国工人日报记者发表谈话
    【新华社莫斯科三日电】参加国际经济会议的我国代表团团长南汉宸，在三月三十一日接见美国工人日报驻莫斯科记者克拉克，就发展中美贸易关系的问题发表谈话如下：
    问：美国与中国之间的贸易有没有开展的可能？
    答：我认为，中国与美国之间的贸易，已经有多年的历史，今后不但可以恢复，而且还有进一步扩大的可能。中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席于一九四九年十月一日政府成立之日，即向各国政府明白宣布：“凡愿遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的任何外国政府，本政府均愿与之建立外交关系。”我们一贯拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领明确规定了“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”的方针。中华人民共和国成立以来，曾经有一个时期中美之间的贸易有相当的发展，其数字不但不少于解放以前，而且开始有超过的趋势。这足以证明新中国与美国的贸易不但能够恢复，并且完全具备超过的条件。
    问：为什么新中国对于美国的生意，可能比旧中国更多？
    答：新中国国际贸易的规模必然超过旧中国。事实上不但已经超过了解放以前，而且超过了第二次世界大战以前。因为新中国的农民获得了土地，随着农民生产积极性的空前提高，农民的购买力也正在逐步提高。将近五亿人民的购买力的逐步提高，已使国内市场空前扩大。因此中国需要输入大量的工业设备、器材、工业原料、化学原料以及工业品，以满足人民的需要。同时中国有大量的农产品、畜产品、手工业品，可以供应各国人民的需要。因此新中国国际贸易的规模已经远远超过旧中国，并且在继续发展着。
    问：目前美国与中国贸易由于政治的原因，已经陷于停顿状态，今后有恢复的可能吗？
    答：目前美国与中国贸易的停顿完全是美国政府实施封锁与禁运的结果。美国政府不顾美国人民的意愿与需要，在进行干涉朝鲜的战争和侵占中国的台湾之后，对中国实施了封锁与禁运。结果使美国工业家、商业家、农业家失去了近五亿人口的广大的持久的可靠的市场，使民用工商业的危机日益加深。因此美国官员布鲁克斯也不能不承认：“美国商人对于这套封锁法令的恐惧和不耐，是可以充分了解的。”（美国“对外贸易周刊”一九五一年十二月十一日）我们认为美国人民促使美国政府取消封锁与禁运措施，以恢复中美贸易的努力，是完全正当的。如果美国政府能够取消封锁与禁运，中国与美国的贸易是能够立即恢复与发展的。
