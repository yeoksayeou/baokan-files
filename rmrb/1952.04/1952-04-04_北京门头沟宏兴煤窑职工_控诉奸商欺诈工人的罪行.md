    Employees of Hongxing Coal Mine in Mentougou, Beijing, Accuse Unscrupulous Merchants of Cheating Workers

    To the Editor: We are employees of the Hongxing Coal Mine in Mentougou, Beijing. We want to accuse the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Zhen of his crimes. He does not implement the labor-management contract and has exploited workers' wages to the tune of more than 20 million yuan. The most despicable thing is that he uses gambling to corrupt and defraud workers. He often forces workers to play "pai gow," "mahjong," and "poker." If he loses, he continues to gamble until he wins. If the workers lose, he records the debt on the books and deducts it from their wages. As far as we know, some workers have been burdened with debt because of this, some owing two million yuan, and others owing one million yuan. Even during the "Five-Anti" campaign, he insisted that we workers play cards, saying, "If you don't play, you'll be fired." He doesn't value the safety of workers' lives at all. When worker Pang Genlin fell ill, the trade union asked him to pay for Pang's medical treatment, and he said, "30,000 or 50,000 yuan is okay, but no more!" But Pang was very ill and needed to be hospitalized, costing 200,000 yuan. When he heard this, he immediately said, "200,000 yuan? We might as well save it to buy him a coffin!" He usually pretends to be a "Communist Party member" and an "old revolutionary," trying to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and intimidate the workers. He makes false accounts to evade national taxes, steals state property, and bribes public security cadres. He is utterly evil and truly a poisonous and foul-smelling unscrupulous merchant. Recently, he has even resisted the "Five-Anti" campaign by stopping work, firing workers, and obstructing workers' study. We can no longer tolerate his rampant behavior and demand that the government severely punish him and vent our anger for us workers.

    北京门头沟宏兴煤窑职工
    控诉奸商欺诈工人的罪行
    编辑同志：我们是北京门头沟宏兴煤窑的职工。我们要控诉我窑奸商周珍的罪行。他不执行劳资合同，剥削工人工资二千多万元。最下流的是，他用赌博方式腐蚀欺诈工人。他经常强迫工人“推牌九”“打麻将”“打扑克”。他输了就继续赌下去，一直到他赢了为止。工人输了，他把欠额记在账上，从工资中扣除。据我们所知，有些工人因此背了一身债，有的二百万元，有的一百万元。甚至在“五反”运动中，他还硬要我们工人打牌，他说：“不打就开除你们。”他根本不重视工人生命安全。工人庞根林生病，工会要他给庞治病，他说：“三万五万可以，多了不行！”但庞病的很重，需住医院费二十万元。他一听，即说：“二十万元，等留着给他买棺材吧！”他平常冒充“共产党员”“老革命”，企图破坏共产党的威信和威吓工人。他造假账偷漏国税，盗卖国家资财，贿赂公安干部，无恶不作，真是一个毒气熏天的奸商。最近他更以停工解雇工人、阻挠工人学习来抵抗“五反”运动。我们不能再容忍他的横行，要求政府严办他，替我们工人们出气。
