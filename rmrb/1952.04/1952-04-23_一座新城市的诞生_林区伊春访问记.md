The Birth of a New City
——A Visit to Yichun in the Forest Area
Mei Zheng

(I)
In Songjiang Province in Northeast China, there is a newly built city. When the sun just rises, overlooking from Yinan Mountain, a beautiful picture unfolds. Flocks of white gulls soar over the Tangwang River; the artificially transplanted wild roses are not yet in bloom, but the clumps of red branches alone have decorated the Yichun River very beautifully. More lovely than these natural scenes is the atmosphere of labor in the triangular area where the two rivers meet. There, four towering chimneys emit dragon-shaped plumes of smoke, machines rumble, axes clang, and processed wood piles up like mountains in the vast yards. To the south, over an area of four square miles, workers and independent laborers from the forest area, along with their family members, are repairing cars and tractors, repairing logging tools, operating various processing machines, refining rosin... To the west, near the four large overpasses, forestry workers are operating timber in a coordinated manner, preparing for the tense timber export task; to the right, in a depression, construction workers are ramming and repairing bridges. Close to Nanshan is the commercial district, where there are many pedestrians on the streets. Trains loaded with various building timber rush between the industrial area, commercial area, and residential area, and rush back with production and living supplies... This is Yichun, a new city with a population of over 12,000.

In the evening, a stranger strolling in Yichun street, when he sees rows of tall buildings, wide roads, brilliant electric lights, crowds of people filing into the theater, cars speeding along the street..., he would never think that this is a new city that has emerged from scratch in four years, but this is absolutely true.

(II)
At the foot of Yichun Nanshan, in the wilderness overgrown with grass as deep as a person's waist, there is a low, dilapidated cottage.

It is hard to imagine how sparsely populated this place was four years ago. From Xilin (west of Yichun) to Cuiluan (northeast of Yichun), in a vast area of more than two hundred miles, there were only dozens of people, including Xu Fa, Li Jiangui, Lv Wenbin, Wang Zhenwu, Qiu Zhengzhen, Old Dingtou, Old Pantou, Old Hei Zhang, etc. These were all the original residents of Yichun. They talked endlessly about the habits and activity patterns of various wild animals as if they were telling myths, such as how black bears fight tigers, how tigers hunt deer, how "zhailangzi" (a beast resembling a small pug) urinate to resist wild beasts and protect people sleeping in the mountains and forests, etc. These were the things they saw most often every day. As for talking about their neighbors, they were so unfamiliar that they couldn't even name them. For example, "Old Hei Zhang" was given this nickname because they only knew his surname was Zhang and his complexion was very dark. The reason was that they lived far apart. For example, if Xu Fa wanted to visit someone, he had to go out at least ten miles to find another person.

"It's really a step to heaven!" This is the common feeling of old residents such as Xu Fa after comparing today's prosperity with the desolation of the past.

(III)
From 1948 to the present, in a short period of four years, the working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have created miracles here. They have built nearly 100,000 square meters of new public and private houses, as well as bridges, roads and motor roads, a theater with a capacity of more than 2,000 people, and a sports square with a capacity of more than 10,000 people.

In urban construction, forestry workers, troops stationed here, and residents have made great contributions. For example, the public sports field built last year was originally a wasteland overgrown with weeds and hazel trees, with ups and downs. In the middle of the wasteland, there were two sheds on the hill. After the Yichun Forest Party Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized, all forestry workers and the public security forces unanimously signed up to contribute their labor in their spare time to build it. The owner of the plank shed voluntarily dismantled the plank house and built another one elsewhere with the assistance of the Forest Industry Administration. Some residents also volunteered to participate in the construction (and were later paid some wages). In this way, in dozens of days of spare time, tens of thousands of catties of weeds were removed, more than a dozen mounds of about thirty cubic meters each were leveled, and more than twenty pits and puddles with diameters of more than ten meters were filled. Green painted wooden fences and viewing seats were built around the square, and a tall rostrum, command platform, and library were built on the south side. Single bars, parallel bars, basketball hoops... were erected in the field. All the construction projects in the city, except for the civilian houses, were built with the voluntary labor of the working people.

Now, Yichun is continuing to be built. In addition to the 2,600 basic construction workers participating in the construction, the vast number of forestry workers are actively requesting to contribute their labor in their spare time with even greater patriotic enthusiasm than last year. Under construction are four large bridges leading to various forest bureaus and neighboring new villages and towns, and a road twelve meters wide and five li long. The area of houses to be built soon is about 24,000 square meters, including a worker's building with a capacity of 300 people for study, rest, and entertainment, a worker's hotel of 1,500 square meters, a worker's sanatorium of 800 square meters (originally there was one, now it is being expanded), a middle school building with a capacity of 300 to 400 people (expanded), factory buildings of more than 2,000 square meters, and so on.

(IV)
The construction of Yichun as a city is by no means accidental, but the inevitable result of production development. Since 1948, the amount of forestry production and the number of employees here have doubled year by year. According to the needs of production development, the People's Government has increased basic construction projects here year by year. In particular, in 1949, the Forest Industry Administration was established here, and a two-story building with a capacity of 3,000 employees and rows of red brick dormitories were built. Later, a large area of factory construction land was surveyed and planned and large-scale construction was carried out. These long-term plans and thriving scenes were spread by people coming in and out of the forest area to the surrounding cities and towns. Many people felt that this place was "expanding" and "had development potential" and were willing to move in and settle down. At the same time, the government subsidized and rewarded people for going into the mountains to participate in forestry construction. Therefore, the population of the entire Yichun forest area has increased sharply year by year, from dozens of people four years ago to more than 60,000 people now (not counting temporary migrant workers entering the mountains). There are no farms here, no grain is produced, it is far from the city, and the supply of materials is difficult. With the annual development of forestry production, the increasing number of forestry workers, institutions, and residents all need a supply base from production materials to living materials. In response to these new situations, the government forestry department started building a city in Yichun, which is densely populated and conveniently located, starting from adapting to actual needs. Now, all the public and private enterprises necessary for a city have been built here almost completely. There is the Yisen Grain Company, which can basically supply the grain needs of the forest area; there is the Yichun Flour Mill, which processes flour and guarantees that most of the Yichun forestry employees have steamed buns as their staple food; there is a branch of the People's Bank, which serves forestry and urban production, and supports hunters (mainly Soviet citizens and Oroqen people) in hunting fur and deer antlers; there are four department stores and employee cooperatives that can initially supply the necessities of Yichun and its surrounding people; there is Yisen Hospital; there are nine hotels with about 200 rooms per day, more than 20 restaurants, and a total of nine Western-style clothing stores and shoe stores; there are also two worker bathhouses (with tubs). With the development of urban construction and industry and commerce, the Forest Area Public Security Bureau was established last year, and public security police stations were set up; insurance companies and tax bureaus have also been established. In order to supply the city with production power and light and heat, a power plant has also been established. In addition, some factories adapted to the characteristics of the forest area and the development of forest industry have also been established. For example, the problem of wood saving, centralized and rational wood manufacturing is one of the essential main contents, therefore, a lumber mill with four new-style fire saws, using local materials and producing more than 100,000 cubic meters of finished timber annually, was established here in 1950. Last year, a glorious page in the history of Chinese forestry was written here, and mechanized logging was first implemented. More than 40 tractors and timber trucks came and went along the Yichun River to gather and transport logs (each one is equivalent to ten horse teams). In order to maintain these "iron horses" (the affectionate name of tractors by forestry workers), tractor and timber truck repair factories and locomotive garages have also been built here. In this way, Yichun has become a city that supplies the needs of the people in the entire Yichun area (more than 200 miles in radius), a production city that serves forestry construction and is expanding day by day. The Yichun Village People's Government, with only a few village cadres who are semi-detached from production (the entire Yichun is still called a village), and a small station with a waiting room plus a ticket office that cannot accommodate 50 people and only starts selling tickets when the train arrives, are no longer able to adapt to the new situation and urgently need reform.

(V)
The establishment of Yichun City is the result of the correct implementation of the forestry management policy under the guidance of the correct policy of the Communist Party and with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union.

People know that in old China, when Japanese imperialism ruled the Northeast, forests were always logged in a predatory manner. Taking the four years from 1942 to 1945 before the liberation of "September 3rd" as an example, the Japanese invaders started from Nancha (Tangyuan County) and logged more than 60 kilometers every year. Where there was good wood, it was shaved bald, leaving no mother trees. In places where good and bad wood were mixed, the good was cut and the bad was left, cutting it in a patchy manner; or everything was cut down together, pulling out the good and leaving the bad, and the forest farm was not cleaned, allowing rotten wood to release rot fungi to corrode the trees. Every year, laborers were temporarily caught in winter to enter the forest for logging, and no one was left to guard and nurture it at ordinary times. So here it was "no one in three seasons, and people squeezed in one season." The rulers of old China and the puppet regime thought every day about how to obtain more wealth at a lower cost, and they did not care about the suffering of the working people at all. When they logged here, they were unwilling to build workers' residences that could withstand the wind, let alone build anything else? In addition, the puppet regime was afraid that the people would occupy the mountains to carry out anti-Japanese activities, so they were unwilling and unable to build any cities here. On the contrary, they tried their best to blockade the forest area and restrict people from entering the mountains.

Only the people's government can cherish the people's wealth. After the people came to power, the forests were also liberated, and they were no longer subject to indiscriminate felling. In the autumn of 1947, the people's forestry personnel, rural Communist Party members, and cadres led migrant workers on foot into this forest area. Even when the logging task was heavy and the material conditions were difficult, they still carried out some preliminary forestry construction, building hundreds of plank houses and horse-rack houses on the construction site for the lumberjacks to live in, replacing the cloth tents and straw sheds that could not withstand the cold wind of the mountainous area at all during the puppet Manchukuo period; the stump height was reduced from half a person's height during the puppet Manchukuo period to less than two feet. In order to carry out forestry construction for a long time, in 1948, the Communist Party and the People's Government led railway and forestry workers to repair the Nancha-Yichun section of the railway that was damaged when the Japanese invaders surrendered; and more than 100 households were mobilized from Jiamusi City to move to Yichun to take care of the forests, and the government subsidized them to build rows of thatched houses. Since then, the "dead forest" has become a "living forest," the roar of trains has replaced the howling of tigers and wolves, and the desolate "Yichun construction site" has begun to become the thriving "Yichun Village"; the forest is no longer allowed to burn for more than half a year without anyone putting it out (two fires that burned for more than half a year occurred here during the puppet Manchukuo period).

Large-scale urban construction work began after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. When recalling the construction at that time and the current happiness, the forestry workers and old residents of Yichun thanked the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and also sincerely thanked the friendly assistance of the socialist Soviet Union. At that time, the Soviet government sent various production and construction experts at the invitation of our Central People's Government. Soviet forestry expert Daidov often came to the Yichun area and introduced a series of advanced Soviet experiences in rational logging, wood manufacturing, wood use, and forest nurturing. The stump height was reduced to 20 centimeters, the treetop wood was utilized, and a huge amount of wood was saved, which invisibly reduced the logging speed (although the mileage was less, the output was more). Mother trees were selected and left, and the forest farm was also cleaned, protecting the young trees and creating good conditions for forest regeneration, so that it could be recycled and logged in the future, without advancing without retreating, and logging once and for all. Under the leadership of the People's Government and inspired by the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in managing socialist forestry, the policy of combining logging and nurturing has been gradually implemented here. Eleven nurturing stations have been established one after another, each station with about 50 fixed workers and 3 to 5 cadres, specializing in weeding, loosening soil, cleaning forest farms, and protecting mother trees and young trees in the logged forest belts and selected seed forests to accelerate the natural regeneration of forests. The various forest bureaus began to implement four-season operations, regularly retaining a certain number of fixed workers, collecting tree seeds and seedlings in the logging gaps, and carrying out sowing and transplanting (2 million red pine seeds were planted last year, with a survival rate of 10%; this spring and summer, it is planned to plant 5 million seeds, with an expected survival rate of 30%. In addition, 320,000 seedlings will be transplanted). In this way, the forest area has become an inexhaustible treasure land, no longer abandoned after logging. The suddenness of logging and the mobility of forestry workers have been reduced, and the situation of "no one in three seasons" in the forest area no longer exists. With the gradual regularization and standardization of forestry construction and the increasing population of the forest area, and it is concentrated and fixed, it requires a political, economic, cultural, and transportation center to serve the vast number of people in the forest area. Therefore, the establishment of Yichun City has become very necessary and has become a reality.

(VI)
The people who personally participate in building the city and creating happiness are particularly gratified when they enjoy the fruits of their labor. When the first sports review conference in the forest area with more than 10,000 participants was held on September 3 last year, the working people looked at the sports field they had built, as flat as a mirror, and the thousands of colorful silk flags waving in the wind, as well as the wonderful performances of the athletes, they were ecstatic, and many people proudly and happily said: "This is our little Moscow Red Square!" Workers and residents who receive reduced or free medical care at Yichun Hospital love to say how "our hospital" is. The newly built worker's sanatorium began to accommodate forestry workers with active work and weak bodies in January this year. The first batch accommodated 23 people. The quilts, blankets, shirts, etc. in the sanatorium are all new. According to the taste of the sanatorium workers, the staple food is steamed buns, dumplings, and noodles, and the non-staple food includes spinach, fish, meat, and eggs; entertainment tools include foreign dramas, poker, and various chess sets. When these weak workers left the sanatorium at the end of March, each person had gained an average of three or four pounds in weight. The most prominent was Yang Jiaxun, a young worker at the Forest Iron Factory, who gained 14 pounds in weight. They went everywhere to promote how good "our sanatorium" is. They generally used the pain of "no one asking about illness and no rest after exhaustion" when working in the forest area during the puppet Manchukuo period to compare with today's happiness. Their work enthusiasm is even higher, and they have been very active figures in the "Three-Anti" struggle recently. Production efficiency has also increased compared to before the sanatorium. Taking the most ordinary hammer worker Bi Dejia as an example, production efficiency has increased by 5% compared to before the sanatorium. He said: "We workers have a home. If we don't work hard, we are sorry to the Communist Party!"

(VII)
Yichun, as early as ten years ago, the Communists used blood and sweat to mix the soil here, laying the initial foundation for today's construction. Last year, the old revolutionary base area visiting group from the Northeast visited here based on the introduction of Comrade Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government and former general of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces. In the mountains and forests of Yichun, they found rows of traces of barracks, residences, and hospitals, and several ruins. One of them was the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University; one was a clothing factory (the remaining sewing machine is now in the Harbin Martyrs Memorial Hall). This was led by Communist, revolutionary martyr General Li Zhaolin in order to grow the revolutionary forces and build here. Before and after the construction, he fought frequently with the enemy and defended this base area with his blood. Later, all the buildings were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. However, the blood and sweat of the martyrs did not flow in vain, and their blood has been exchanged for today's victory. Now, the people can freely use modern tools and equipment here to build high-rise buildings, and a new city has finally been built; and two new-style series kilns have also been established to produce a large number of red bricks to supply the long-term construction needs of Yichun and its surrounding areas; no longer needing to cut wood with bayonets and use hands instead of shovels to mix mud as they did ten years ago. Although a university has not yet been established here, a middle school has been opened in a spacious building, and more than 300 children of forestry workers and residents are studying happily. In Yichun and its surroundings, there are 11 primary schools and 2 forest industry children's schools, with a total of more than 2,000 students. Cuiluan - a new town that has grown from more than a dozen people to more than 2,000 people - is planning to open a middle school. With the expansion of middle schools and primary schools and the development of forestry production, and in order to prepare conditions for future socialist construction, in the near future, Yichun will have a forest industry specialized school to train forestry cadres, and General Zhaolin's legacy of running a university here will surely be fulfilled. Martyrs, rest in peace.

    一座新城市的诞生
    ——林区伊春访问记
    枚正
    （一）
    在我国东北的松江省有一座新建的城市。当太阳刚刚升起的时候，从伊南山俯首鸟瞰，一幅幽美的图画展了开来。群群白鸢翱翔在汤旺河上空；人工移植的野玫瑰，还不到开花的时候，但是，仅仅丛丛红枝，就已把伊春河装饰得非常秀丽。比这些自然景物更可爱的，是两河合流的三角地带的劳动气象。在那里，四尊高耸的烟囱冒着龙形烟缕，机声隆隆，斧声丁丁，广阔场院中制成的木材堆积如山。向南，方圆四里的地面上，肩脊如鳞，林区的工人和独立劳动者、工人家属正在那里检修汽车、拖拉机、修制伐木工具，操纵各种加工机器，炮制松香……。西面四座大天桥的左近，林业工人在一唱一和地操运木材，紧张迎接木材出河任务；右面一片洼地上，修建工人正在打夯修桥。贴近南山的地方，是商业区，街上行人很多。火车载负着建筑用的各种木材，在工业区、商业区、居民区之间驰去，又载着生产、生活供应品奔来……。这就是伊春，一座拥有一万二千多人口的新城市。
    入晚，一个陌生的人，在伊春街上信步漫游，当他看到成排的高大楼房、宽坦的马路、辉煌的电灯、鱼贯进入戏院的人群、沿街飞驰着汽车……的时候，他绝不会想到这是四年内从无到有的一座新城，然而这却是千真万确的事实。
    （二）
    在伊春南山角下，在深及人腰的荒草丛中，有一座低矮破烂的小草房。
    你很难想像四年前这里人烟稀少到什么程度。从西林（伊春以西）到翠峦（伊春东北），方圆二百多里的广大地区中，只有徐发、李建贵、吕文彬、王振五、邱正振、老丁头、老潘头、老黑张等几十个人。这就是原来伊春的全部居民。他们像说神话似地谈起各种野兽的习性和活动规律，诸如黑熊如何和老虎决斗，老虎如何捕鹿，豸狼子（一种像小叭狗样的兽）如何撒尿抵御猛兽、卫护睡卧山林的人们等等，真是滔滔不绝。他们每日最常见到的就是这些。至于谈到他的邻居，他们生疏到甚至叫不出名字，比如“老黑张”，就是因只知道他姓张，脸色很黑，不知名字，而给起的代号。原因是住得相隔很远，像徐发要串一个门，至少得出去十几里路，才能找到另一个人。
    “真是一步登天！”这是徐发等老居民对比了今日繁荣和往昔荒凉情景后共同的感想。
    （三）
    从一九四八年开始到现在，在短短四年的时间中，劳动人民在共产党、人民政府的领导下，在这里创造了奇迹。共建造了近十万平方米的公私新房，还有桥梁、马路和汽车路、一座可容两千余人的剧院、一处可容万余人的体育广场。
    在城市建设中，林业职工、驻军、居民等，均有很大贡献。例如去年修建的公共体育场，原来是一片蓬蒿、榛棵丛生、突起突伏的荒场。荒场中间土丘上有两间棚房。经中共伊春森林党委动员，全体林业职工和公安部队一致报名在业余时间献工修建；板棚主人自愿把板房拆掉，在森林工业管理局资助下到别处另盖。有些居民也自愿献工参加修建（后来给了一部分工资）。就这样，在几十天的业余时间中，就割除了数万斤荒草，铲平了十几个三十立方米左右的土丘，填平了二十多个直径十余米的土坑和水洼，广场周围筑上绿漆木栅、观座，南面搭起了高大的主席台、指挥台、图书室，场中架起了单杠、双杠、篮球架……。全城所有的建筑工程，除了民房之外，无一没有劳动人民的义务献工。
    现在，伊春正在继续进行建设。参加修建的除了两千六百名基本建设工人之外，广大林业职工正以比去年更高的爱国热情，积极要求在业余时间献工修建。已动工修建中的有四座通往各林务分局和邻近新村镇的大桥，一条宽十二米、长五里路的马路。即将动工修建的房屋面积，约两万四千平方米，其中除了一部民房之外，有可容三百人学习、休息、娱乐的工人大楼，有一千五百平方米的工人旅馆，有八百平方米的工人业余疗养所（原已有，现为增建），有一所可容三四百人的中学校舍（增建），有两千余平方米的厂房等等。
    （四）
    伊春之建设为城市，绝非偶然，而是生产发展的必然结果。从一九四八年起，这里的林业生产量和职工数目，逐年倍增。根据生产发展的需要，人民政府在这里逐年增修基本建设工程，特别是一九四九年在这里成立了森林工业管理局，建立了一所可容三千职工的两层大楼和一栋栋红砖宿舍，以后又测划出大片建厂地带并大规模施工。这些长远打算和欣欣向荣的景象，由出入林区的人们传告到周围各城乡，许多人都感到这里“拓开了”，“有发展头”，愿移来落户；同时，政府并资助和奖励人民入山参加林业建设，因而整个伊春林区的人口年年激增，现在已由四年前的数十人增至六万余人（临时入山的民工不计在内）。这里没有农田，不产粮食，隔城甚远，物资供应困难。随着林业生产的年年发展，日益增多的林业职工、机关、居民，从生产资料到生活资料都需要有一个供应基地。针对着这些新的情况，政府林业部门便在人口较密、地点适中的伊春，从适应实际需要出发，开始建城。现在，一切城市中所必需的公私企业，在这里已建设得差不多一应俱全了。这里有伊森粮食公司，它可以基本上供应林区的粮食需要；这里有伊春火磨厂，加工面粉，保证了伊春大部分林业员工以馒头为主食品；这里有人民银行支行，为林业及城市生产服务，并扶助猎户（主要是苏侨和鄂伦春人）打皮张、猎鹿茸等；有四个可以初步供应伊春及其周围人民必需品的百货公司、职工合作社；有伊森医院；有九家日宿二百人左右的旅馆，有二十余家饭馆，洋服店和皮鞋店共九家；还有工人澡塘两所（内有盆汤）。随着城市建设和工商业的发展，去年成立了林区公安处，并设有公安派出所；保险公司、税务所也建立起来了。为了供应城市以生产动力和光、热，还建立了一座发电厂。另外，还建立了一些适应林区特点和森林工业发展的工厂。例如木材的节约问题，集中进行合理造材就是必不可少的主要内容之一，因此，这里在一九五零年建立起一所拥有四台新式火锯、就地取材、年产十余万立米成材的制材厂。去年，这里写下了中国林业史上光辉的一页，最先实行了机械化采伐，四十多台拖拉机和运材汽车来往于伊春河畔集拢和运搬原木（每台顶十付马套子）。为了保养这些“铁马儿”（林业工人对拖拉机的爱称），这里还建设了拖拉机、运材车修理工厂和机车库。这样，伊春就成了一座供应整个伊春地区（方圆二百多里）人民需要的城市，一座服务于林业建设并日益扩大的生产城市。只有几个半脱离生产的村干部的伊春村人民政府（现整个伊春仍称村），以及候车室加票房容不下五十人车临到站才开始卖票的小车站，都已不能适应新的情况，亟待改革。
    （五）
    伊春城市的建立，是在共产党正确政策引导下，在苏联的友谊帮助下，正确执行林业经营方针的结果。
    人们知道，在旧中国，在日本帝国主义统治着东北的时候，森林一直都是被掠夺式地采伐着。以一九四二至一九四五年“九三”解放以前这四年为例，日寇从南叉（汤原县）开始，每年都伐进六十多公里。有好木的地方，就剃成光头，一棵母树也不留。好木坏木混杂的地方，则伐好留坏，伐得花花答答；或一起伐倒，拉好留坏，林场也不清理，让朽木尽情地散发腐菌去蚀害林木。每年都是到了冬季才临时捉劳工进林采伐，平时根本不留人看守和抚育。所以这里是“三季无人，一季人挤”。旧中国和敌伪统治者们，每日所想的是如何以更低的代价来获得更多财富，根本不关心劳动人民疾苦。他们在这里采伐时，连工人的住处都不肯修建得能够挡风，还能谈到建设什么别的呢？再加敌伪害怕人民据山进行抗日活动等等，因而他们就不肯也不可能在这里建立什么城市。相反的，他们极力封锁林区，限制人民入山。
    只有人民的政府才能爱护人民的财富。人民当权之后，森林也获得解放，它已再不受狂砍滥伐。一九四七年秋季，人民的林政人员、农村共产党员、干部，带领民工徒步进入这一林区。虽在采伐任务繁重、物质条件困难的情况下，仍进行了一些初步的林业建设，在工地修建了成百栋的板房、马架房，让伐木工人居住，代替了敌伪时期根本不能抵御山区寒风的布帐草棚；伐根由伪满时的半人高降到二尺以下。为了长期进行林业建设，一九四八年共产党和人民政府领导铁路、林业职工，将日寇投降时破坏了的南叉——伊春段铁路修复；又自佳木斯市动员百多户居民移来伊春看护森林，政府资助他们建造了成排的草房。从此，“死林子”变成了“活林子”，火车的吼叫代替了虎啸狼嗥，荒凉的“伊春工地”开始变成了欣欣向荣的“伊春村”；森林也不再纵令山火延烧半年以上而无人扑救了（伪满时此地曾发生两次延烧半年以上的大火）。
    大规模地进行建城工作，还是开始于一九四九年中华人民共和国成立之后。伊春的林业职工和老居民们，在回忆起当时兴工和现在的幸福时，他们于感谢共产党、毛主席的英明领导同时，也衷心感谢社会主义苏联的友谊帮助。那时，苏联政府应我们中央人民政府的邀请，派来了各种生产建设的专家。苏联林业专家达依多夫常来伊春地区，介绍了苏联一系列的合理采伐、造材、用材和抚育森林的先进经验。伐根降低到二十公分，梢头木被利用了，节约了巨量木材，无形中减低了伐进速度（进的里程虽少，出材却多）。选留了母树，林场也清理了，保护了幼树，给森林更新创造了良好条件，以后可以回头来循环采伐，不致有进无退，一伐永光。在人民政府领导和苏联经营社会主义林业的先进经验启示下，这里已逐步实行了采伐和抚育相结合的方针，先后建立了十一个抚育站，每站有五十名左右的固定工人，三至五名干部，专门在已伐林带和选留的种子林中，进行除草、松土、清理林场、保护母树幼树工作，加速森林的天然更新。各林务分局开始实行四季作业，经常保有一定数量的固定工人，在采伐间隙采集树种和树苗，进行播种、移植（去年种红松二百万粒籽，成活率为百分之十；今年春夏两季计划种五百万粒籽，预计成活百分之三十。另外移植树苗三十二万株）。这样一来，林区就变成了伐不尽的宝地，不再伐完即弃。采伐的突击性和林业工人的流动性减低了，以往林区“三季无人”的情况不复存在。随着林业建设的逐步经常化、正规化和林区人口日益增多，而且集中、固定，就要求有一个政治、经济、文化、交通中心，来为林区广大人民服务。因此，伊春城市的建立就成为非常必需，而且已经成为事实了。

    亲身参加建立城市、创造幸福的人们，在享受他们劳动成果的时候，是分外快慰的。当去年九月三日举行万余人参加的林区首次体育检阅大会的时候，劳动人民望着自己所建坦平如镜的运动场，和成千迎风招展的彩绸旗帜，以及运动员的精彩表演，他们欢欣若狂，不少人又骄傲又快乐地说：“这是咱们的小莫斯科红场！”在伊春医院受到减费或免费医疗的工人、居民，最爱说“咱们的医院”如何如何。新修的工人业余疗养所，今年一月已开始收容工作积极、身体衰弱的林业职工休养。第一批收容了二十三人。所里的被褥、毯子、衬衣等全是新的。根据疗养职工的口胃，规定主食品是馒头、饺子、面条，副食品有菠菜、鱼、肉、鸡蛋等；娱乐工具有洋戏、扑克、各种棋具等。这些病弱职工于三月末出所时，每人体重平均增加了三四斤，最突出的是森林铁工厂青年工人杨家训，体重增加了十四斤。他们到处宣传“咱们的疗养所”如何好，他们普遍拿伪满时在林区做工时“有病无人问，累死不得歇”的痛苦，来对比今日的幸福。工作积极性更高涨了，他们最近在“三反”斗争中都是非常活跃的人物。生产效率也比疗养以前提高，以最普通的锤工毕得加为例，生产效率比疗养前提高了百分之五。他说：“我们工人有了家，若不加油干，对不起共产党！”

    伊春，早在十年以前，共产党人就在这里用血汗浇合了泥土，为今天的建设初奠了根基。去年来东北的老根据地参观团，根据松江省人民政府主席、前抗日联军将领冯仲云同志的介绍，曾访问了这里。在伊春的山林中，找到了成排营房、住宅、医院的痕迹，和几处残垣断壁。其中一处是抗日军政大学；一处是被服工厂（残留的缝衣机现存哈尔滨烈士纪念馆中）。这是共产党人、革命烈士李兆麟将军为生息壮大革命力量而在这里领导建设的。建设的前前后后，曾频与敌寇搏斗，用热血捍卫这个根据地。后来，所有建筑都遭日寇破坏。但是，先烈们的血汗并没有白流，他们的鲜血已换来了今日的胜利。现在，人民已可在这里自由地用近代工具器材建造高楼大厦，新的城市终于建设起来了；而且还建立了两座新式串窑，大量烧制红砖，供应伊春及其周围长期建设所需；再不用像十年以前那样用刺刀砍木、以手代铲合泥施工了。这里虽然还没能办起大学，中学却已在宽敞的楼房中开办起来，有三百多名林业工人、居民的子弟在愉快地学习着。伊春及其周围，已有十一处小学，两处森林工业子弟学校，共有两千多名学生。翠峦——一座由十余人增至两千多人的新镇——正拟开办中学。随着中学、小学的扩大和林业生产的发展，并为将来的社会主义建设准备条件，不久的将来，伊春将有一处培养林业干部的森林工业专门学校出现，兆麟将军在此兴办大学的遗志定可完遂。先烈们，安息吧。
