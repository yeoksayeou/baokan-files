Qu Yao Li Mutual Aid Team Guarantees a Maximum Yield of 1,000 Jin of Seed Cotton Per Mu This Year

Dear Chairman Mao: Our mutual aid team and I personally have been rewarded by the People's Government and have been given the glorious title of "Cotton Bumper Harvest Model." Representatives of the beloved and admirable Chinese People's Volunteer Army homecoming delegation and the Korean People's delegation to China also personally visited my home the other day. We truly feel infinite honor and excitement. Dear Chairman Mao, we are thinking this way: Only under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, with the care and help of the great motherland, and under the protection of the heroic struggle of the Volunteer Army, have we working people been liberated, are we able to freely and happily cultivate our own land well, are we able to obtain bumper harvests, are our lives able to become increasingly prosperous, and are we able to have a glorious position. Therefore, our glory should first and foremost be attributed to your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, and to the Volunteer Army comrades who are fighting heroically in Korea.

Dear Chairman Mao, we sincerely and wholeheartedly tell you that we are the farmers of the great and glorious New China. We will never be arrogant and complacent. We must use all our strength and skills to strive to increase the production of cotton and grain, to make our motherland more prosperous and powerful, and to create a happier life for ourselves. We have heard that the American devils are now using germ warfare to harm our Chinese and Korean people's armies and the Chinese and Korean peace-loving people, attempting to destroy our happy lives. We must strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea, and defeat these abominable American devils. Although we are in the rear, our hearts are in the front. Doing work in the fields is like fighting on the front lines. We must achieve victory on the production front and use our victory to support the War to Resist America and Aid Korea to achieve its final victory. Therefore, we specially guarantee to you:

(1) We must follow the road of mutual aid and cooperation that you have indicated, continuously consolidate, improve, and develop our mutual aid team, help all 33 newly established mutual aid teams in the village to gradually consolidate and improve, implement equivalent exchange, and realize the five major combinations of production and patriotism, organization and technology improvement, sideline occupations, supply and marketing cooperatives, and cultural learning.

(2) On the basis of last year's bumper harvest, we must ensure that the average cotton yield of the whole team reaches 640 jin per mu, and the highest record reaches 1,000 jin per mu, and we must lead the whole village to achieve "bumper harvests for every household, and models for everyone."

(3) We must actively promote our own experience, humbly learn science and technology, and learn the experience of all bumper harvest models and peasant brothers.

Dear Chairman Mao, under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, in our beloved motherland, we have great confidence and determination to thoroughly realize the above plan. We think that only in this way can we be worthy of the happiness and honor given to us by you and the Communist Party and the People's Government.

Finally, we are also willing to join hands with all the national labor models who have been rewarded this time, under your leadership, together with the people of the whole country, to strive for the construction of a New Democratic New China and for the future of agricultural collectivization and socialism. We respectfully wish you good health!

Respectfully, all members of the Qu Yao Li Mutual Aid Team, Qu Zhuangtou Village, Jie County, Shanxi

Cotton Bumper Harvest Model Zhang Qi Rong Strives for Each of His Three Mu of Cotton Fields to Produce Over 1,000 Jin of Seed Cotton This Year

Dear Chairman Mao: I was awarded the title of Cotton Bumper Harvest Model in last year's Patriotic Bumper Harvest Movement and received a glorious reward from the state. I feel extremely happy! Only in the new society under your leadership do I have today's glory! I will use all the prize money to buy means of production and expand reproduction.

After receiving the award, I will never be arrogant and complacent. I must continue to study technology, absorb experience, use my brain more, think of more ways, and strive to improve the yield per unit area. This year, my three mu of cotton fields will strive to reach a yield of 1,050 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 307 jin compared to last year. The 23 mu of cotton fields of the entire mutual aid team will also guarantee an average yield of 650 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In order to achieve this year's bumper harvest target, I must first do a good job in drought resistance and prevention. The entire mutual aid team will install two waterwheels, repair two wells, dig a new well, expand the irrigated area, and increase the waterlogged land by four mu. Second, cotton fields should pay attention to preserving soil moisture and preventing drought. Deep plowing, frequent harrowing, and frequent rolling. This spring, the land should be plowed three times, and then harrowed and rolled tightly to preserve moisture. Hoe eight times and water eight times, using light and frequent watering methods, watering three fingers each time, once every six or seven days. Third, apply more fertilizer, carefully select seeds, and prevent and control pests. We have prepared various fertilizers and pesticides and will immediately eliminate pests upon discovery.

In addition, we have also established a science and technology research group to continuously improve agricultural technology and strive to complete this year's bumper harvest plan by 100%. We know that increasing cotton production is equivalent to eliminating more American invaders! We will dedicate 10% of this year's increased production to the Volunteer Army, so that they can severely attack the brutal American imperialism on the front lines! Defend the great motherland!

Workers of a Workshop in a Factory in Huludao Determined to Complete the Second Quarter Production Task Ahead of Schedule

Dear Chairman Mao: Since you issued the great call to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and launch the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, all the workers in our workshop have actively responded to your call. According to the 1951 plan, our workshop should have stopped work for overhaul in January and February 1952, but in order to realize your call, under the correct leadership of the Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the factory, all our workers guaranteed to continue safe production in order to create more wealth for the country and increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea. To this end, we revised the patriotic convention and launched a patriotic red flag competition. Everyone made a plan to ensure safe production in their own posts and complete the task ahead of schedule.

After the "Three-Anti" movement was launched, the enthusiasm of all employees was further enhanced. We have all made plans to combine "tiger"-hunting with production. Everyone is determined to guarantee good production and at the same time arrest corrupt elements and thoroughly defeat the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie. As of March 15, we eliminated mechanical and casualty accidents, overcame the difficulties of furnace replacement and flue blockage, and completed the state's first quarter production plan half a month ahead of schedule. At the same time, we cooperated with other workshops to catch four "big tigers."

All the workers in our workshop guarantee to thoroughly defeat the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie and use the practical action of completing the second quarter production task ahead of schedule to combat the heinous crimes of American imperialism in spreading germs.

All Employees of the Fifth Paper Mill in Northeast China Complete the First Quarter Production Task Ahead of Schedule

Dear Chairman Mao: All the employees of our Fifth Paper Mill in Northeast China have further improved their class consciousness in the "Three-Anti" movement. We have implemented the combination of "tiger"-hunting and production, and have achieved victories on both fronts. Since the launch of the competition in our steaming workshop, with the active efforts of all workers, the close cooperation of various departments, and the strong support of auxiliary departments and engineering and technical personnel, the output has increased from five to six cylinders (pulp) per day to nine cylinders per day. All the workers unanimously shouted the slogan "Guarantee quality, resolutely complete the production task of the first quarter, and fight back against the heinous crimes of American aggressors in spreading germs." Finally, at 9:30 a.m. on March 26, we gloriously completed the state's production task for the first quarter five days and fourteen and a half hours ahead of schedule. All our employees said that we will never be proud in the future, continue to work hard, and strive for greater victories in addition to consolidating the achievements we have already obtained. We hereby report the good news to you. With respect,

All Employees of the Fifth Paper Mill in Northeast China

    向毛主席保证把生产工作作好
    曲耀离互助组保证今年棉田每亩最高产量达籽棉一千斤
    亲爱的毛主席：我们互助组和我个人都受到了人民政府的奖励，并且得到了“棉花丰产模范”的光荣称号。伟大、可爱的中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表，日前还亲自来到我家访问。我们真是感到无限的光荣和兴奋。亲爱的毛主席，我们心里这样想着：只有在您和共产党的领导下，在伟大祖国的关怀和帮助下，在志愿军的英勇斗争的保护下，我们劳动人民才得到了解放，才能够自由幸福地在自己的土地上好好耕作，才能获得丰产，我们的光景才能日渐富裕起来，我们才能有光荣的地位。所以，我们的光荣应当首先归功于您和共产党的领导，归功于在朝鲜英勇斗争的志愿军同志们。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们热诚地衷心地告诉您，我们是伟大的光荣的新中国的农民，我们绝不骄傲自满，我们要拿出自己的一切力量和本领来，努力使棉花和粮食的产量更加提高，使我们祖国更加富裕和强大，创造我们更加幸福的生活。我们听说美国鬼子现在又用细菌战来残害我们中朝人民军队和中朝和平人民，企图毁灭我们的幸福生活。我们一定要加强抗美援朝，打败这些可恶的美国鬼子。我们虽然在后方，但是我们的心是在前方的。我们在田地里做活，就好比在前线打仗一样。我们一定要在生产战线上取得胜利，拿我们的胜利支援抗美援朝战争达到它的最后胜利。因此，我们特向您保证：
    （一）一定要走您所指示的互助合作的道路，要不断巩固提高与发展我们的互助组，要帮助全村新建立的三十三个互助组逐步巩固提高，贯彻等价交换，实现生产与爱国、组织起来与提高技术、副业、供销社、文化学习的五大结合。
    （二）一定要在去年丰收的基础上，保证全组棉花产量每亩平均达到六百四十斤，最高纪录达一千斤，而且要领导全村做到“户户丰产，人人模范”。
    （三）一定要积极地推广自己的经验，虚心学习科学技术，学习各位丰产模范和农民兄弟们的经验。
    亲爱的毛主席，在您和共产党的领导下，在我们这样可爱的祖国里，我们有极大的信心与决心，彻底实现上述计划。我们想，只有这样，才对得起您和共产党、人民政府给予我们的幸福和荣誉。
    最后，我们还愿意和这次一同受奖的全国所有的劳动模范，手携手地在您的领导下，同全国人民一道，为建设新民主主义新中国，争取农业集体化和社会主义的前途而努力。敬祝您的身体健康！

    棉花丰产模范张齐荣争取今年三亩棉田各产籽棉千余斤
    亲爱的毛主席：在去年爱国丰产运动中，我被评为棉花丰产模范，受到国家的光荣奖励，感到万分高兴！只有在您领导下的新社会，我才有今天的光荣！我要把奖金全部买成生产资料，扩大再生产。
    我得奖后，决不骄傲自满，我更要继续钻研技术，吸收经验，多动脑筋，多想办法，努力提高单位面积产量。我今年的三亩棉田，争取每亩产量达到一千零五十斤籽棉，要比去年增产三百零七斤；全互助组的二十三亩棉田，也保证每亩平均产籽棉六百五十斤。
    为要达到今年的丰产目标，我首先要作好抗旱防旱工作，全互助组要安装水车两辆，修井两眼，新打井一眼，扩大灌溉面积，增加水地四亩。第二、棉田要注意保墒防旱。深耕、勤耙、勤耱，今春要耕三次，耕后紧耙、紧耱，好保蓄水分。锄八遍，浇八水，采用轻浇、勤浇办法，每次浇三指，六七天浇一次。第三、要多施肥、精选种籽和防治虫害。我们已经准备好各种肥料和杀虫药剂，发现虫害立即扑灭。
    另外，我们还成立了科学技术研究组，不断改进农业技术，争取百分之百完成今年的丰产计划。我们知道多增产棉花，就等于多消灭美国侵略者！我们要以今年增产的百分之十献给志愿军，让他们在前方狠狠打击残暴的美帝国主义！保卫伟大的祖国！
