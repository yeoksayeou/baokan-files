    Relevant Departments Should Immediately Solve the Drinking Water Problem for Residents of Mentougou Town
    Editor: The drinking water problem for residents of Mentougou Town in Beijing urgently needs to be solved.
    Mentougou is a mining area. The entire area has over 70,000 people, with 50,000 living in Mentougou Town. In 1950, the Beijing Tap Water Company added tap water facilities in Mentougou Town. However, due to inadequate planning before construction, the water supplied is still not enough for the needs of the households in Mentougou Town. Since 1951, the entire town has experienced a water shortage; now, the residents' drinking water problem is even more serious. There are eight water stations in the town, each releasing water for just over two hours a day, dispensing only a little over 100 dan of water, but there are often over 200 water carriers waiting. Residents have to wait two days to get one dan of water. Some people can't buy water and have to fetch unsanitary water from the mines to drink. The drinking water problem has now become one of the most important issues in the lives of the people in Mentougou Town. The masses have raised this issue with the local People's Government many times, but it has not been resolved yet. I hope the relevant leaders will quickly solve this problem.

    Yangquan No. 4 Mine Strengthens Education, Improving Workers' Production Enthusiasm
    Editor: In the early stages of the "Three-Anti" movement, some leading cadres at the state-owned Yangquan No. 4 Mine showed a tendency to neglect production. On January 8, the mine experienced a localized gas accident, and the workers' production morale was low, resulting in the failure to complete the January production target. In February, the leadership extracted some engineering and technical personnel and grassroots production cadres to be responsible for leading production. However, some of these personnel had bureaucratic work styles in the past, and they were afraid of workers' opinions, so they dared not educate the workers. At this time, the production situation was still chaotic. After discussion and research, the leadership again transferred some trade union cadres to strengthen propaganda and education for the workers. As a result, the workers' awareness improved, and their production morale also improved. In March, the mine overfulfilled its production target.
    In order to do a better job in future production work, we suggest that the leading cadres of this mine continue to strengthen education for the workers. At the same time, we suggest that the leading cadres educate the technical personnel to value the workers' rationalization proposals. In the past, when repairing the Ping Shun mine canal, the project collapsed before it was completed because the technical personnel rejected the workers' rationalization proposals. This bias should be quickly corrected.

    Leading Cadres of Changping County Neglect Forest Protection Work
    Continuous Incidents of Burning Mountains and Destroying Forests
    Editor: Leading cadres of Changping County have consistently neglected forest protection work, resulting in frequent incidents of burning mountains and destroying forests in the county, causing significant losses to state property.
    Last December, Cheerying and other villages in the sixth district of the county burned more than 15,000 mu of mountains, destroying 3.75 million jin of shrubs and firewood. However, the leading cadres of this county did not conduct a profound review after this serious incident of destroying forests.
    On March 4th, the Government Administration Council issued instructions on fire prevention and forest protection. The cadres of Changping County did not strengthen fire prevention and forest protection work according to these instructions, resulting in continued incidents of burning mountains in the county. In the first and fourth districts alone, there were seven incidents of burning mountains within a month (early March to April 2).
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government clearly pointed out in its decision on strengthening forest protection and fire prevention: once a mountain fire occurs, the local People's Government should immediately mobilize the masses to vigorously extinguish it and promptly investigate responsibility. However, the leading cadres of Changping County did not immediately send people to handle the situation after continuous mountain fires. On February 28, the special district sent a working group to investigate the forest fire situation, and the county leading organ only then sent a cadre to cooperate with the inspection.
    We believe that the leading cadres of Changping County are seriously wrong in not earnestly implementing the instructions of the higher authorities on forest protection and fire prevention and allowing incidents of burning mountains to continue to occur. Therefore, we suggest that the Tongxian Special District strengthen its leadership over forest protection work in Changping County to prevent the continued occurrence of incidents of destroying forests.

    Attention Should Be Paid to Clearly Defining Boundaries When Mobilizing the Masses for Afforestation
    Editor: Clearly defining the boundaries of afforestation areas is an important issue in afforestation work. If this work is not done well, it is easy to cause disputes, which not only hinders the development of afforestation work but also affects the unity between counties, districts, and even villages. For example, on March 26, farmers from Fan Kua Village in the sixth district of Huashan County, Shandong, and Jiangying Village in Dangshan County, northern Anhui, had a dispute because of unclear boundaries. Due to unclear boundaries, the masses of Jiangying Village afforested on the sandy wasteland of Fan Kua Village. The next day, the masses of Fan Kua Village began afforestation on the sandy wasteland and arable land of Jiangying Village. The masses of Jiangying Village then pulled out many of the trees planted by the masses of Fan Kua Village within their boundaries. This caused a great waste of manpower and material resources, and at the same time affected the afforestation tasks of both parties. Furthermore, the sandy wasteland in the third district of Huashan borders some areas of Pei County. Because the boundaries between the two regions are unclear, there are frequent incidents of crossing the border to collect firewood and destroy trees. Based on this situation, I suggest that the people's governments of various localities pay attention to the work of clearly defining boundaries when mobilizing the masses for afforestation, so as to avoid disputes, affect unity, and affect production.

    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Wu'an and Other Places in Hebei Province
    Should Not Violate Cotton Price Policies When Purchasing Cotton
    Editor: Supply and marketing cooperatives in Wu'an, Cixian, and other places in Hebei Province have not correctly implemented the cotton price policy of "better cotton, better price; lower cotton, lower price" in the cotton purchasing work, and have arbitrarily lowered grades and lint percentages, causing cotton farmers to be dissatisfied. When purchasing frost-damaged seed cotton, the grass-roots cooperatives in various places in Wu'an County gave the masses 100 to 300 yuan less per jin, causing the masses to suffer great losses. The Lan Cun grass-roots cooperative in the county purchased more than 200,000 jin of seed cotton from January to March this year. Because it did not implement the grade price differences and the regulations on lint percentage, it gave the masses more than 12 million yuan less. Some cadres of the Lian Cun cooperative in Fengchang and other places even thought that the 2.2% handling fee for purchasing cotton on behalf of the state was too little, and they even added the transportation costs from the village cooperative to the district cooperative to the cotton farmers, giving 20 to 50 yuan less per jin of cotton. Some grading personnel in the cooperatives in Cixian and other places also had the idea of "rather high than low" when performing grading work, and they were afraid of losing money if the cotton was downgraded. Because these cooperatives in these areas did not correctly implement the grading regulations when purchasing cotton, and had a serious purely profit-seeking viewpoint, they infringed on the interests of the cotton farmers, causing the cotton farmers to have the idea of equal value. Some cotton farmers, because the local area lowered the grades and lint percentage, would rather go to other districts to sell, thereby affecting the spring plowing production of the cotton farmers. The above phenomena cannot be allowed to continue. It is hoped that the superior supply and marketing cooperatives in the above-mentioned areas will carefully check their cotton purchasing work and immediately take effective measures to quickly correct the purely profit-seeking viewpoint in order to ensure the interests of the cotton farmers and complete the national cotton purchasing task.

    The Tendency of Forcing the Masses to Dig Wells Should Be Corrected
    Editor: The phenomenon of forcing the masses to pay for digging wells has occurred in several villages in Changping County, Hebei Province. The village cadres of Shuangta Village in the second district led the masses to dig a flowing well, forcing the masses to pay 2,000 yuan per mu of land, causing dissatisfaction among many people. This situation has occurred in more than 20 other villages in the county, further affecting the masses' enthusiasm for digging wells.
    It is hoped that the leading organs of Changping County will conduct an in-depth inspection and correct this bias.

    Sub-North Jiangsu Cooperative Headquarters
    Agricultural Loans Should Be Issued to Farmers
    Editor: In order to help farmers develop production, the Xin'an Branch of the Sub-North Jiangsu People's Bank requested 300 million yuan in agricultural loans from the Huaiyin Central Branch in mid-September last year. After receiving the loan, the Xin'an Branch, in addition to directly lending out 102.6 million yuan, handed over the remaining funds to the county cooperative for transfer to the Sub-North Jiangsu Cooperative Headquarters to uniformly purchase iron and wood raw materials and allocate them to the Xin'an Iron and Wood Factory to produce agricultural implements. It has been several months since the funds were allocated to the Sub-North Jiangsu Cooperative Headquarters, but the headquarters has not purchased iron and wood raw materials to supply the Xin'an County Iron and Wood Factory. This has not only affected the work of the iron and wood factory but also affected the development of the agricultural bumper harvest campaign in Xin'an County this year. It is hoped that relevant departments will help solve this problem so as not to delay the agricultural season.

    Grain Storage Departments in Various Places Should Pay Attention to Grain Storage Work
    Editor: During the "Three-Anti" movement, some units relaxed their daily business work, causing unnecessary losses to state property. For example, the Hulunbuir League Grain Company in Inner Mongolia, during the "tiger hunting" period, the warehouse was damp, and no one inspected it, causing the flour in the warehouse to become damp and hardened, resulting in the loss of hundreds of jin. Also, the flour warehouse of the Zhalantun Grain Station, because no one was designated to be responsible for grain storage during the "tiger hunting" period, when it snowed, snowflakes floated into the warehouse and melted into water, wetting many jin of flour. Although the losses from these two accidents were small, they are worthy of reminding everyone to pay attention. I believe that all departments responsible for storing grain in various places should conduct an inspection. Liu Ping, Liu Wei

    有关方面应即解决门头沟镇居民的饮水问题
    编辑同志：北京市门头沟镇居民的饮水问题急待解决。
    门头沟是一个工矿区。全区共七万多人，有五万人住在门头沟镇。一九五零年，北京市自来水公司曾在门头沟镇添设了自来水设备。可是，由于施工前计划不周，以致供应的水仍不够门头沟镇住户的需要。自一九五一年起，全镇就发生了水荒；现在，居民饮水问题更加严重。全镇共有八个水站，每站每日放水两小时多，不过出一百多担水，等水的经常有二百多个水担。居民要想用一担水，需要等两天。有些人买不到水，只得到矿上挑不卫生的水吃。饮水问题，现在已经成为门头沟镇人民生活中最重要的问题之一。对这件事，群众已向当地人民政府提出多次意见，但到现在还没有解决。我希望有关领导方面迅速解决这个问题。

    阳泉四矿加强教育工作，提高了工人生产热情
    编辑同志：在“三反”运动初期，国营阳泉四矿有些领导干部有忽视生产的现象。一月八日，该矿发生局部瓦斯事故，工人生产情绪低落，一月份生产任务没有完成。二月，领导方面抽出部分工程技术人员和基层生产干部，负责领导生产。但其中有些人员，过去有官僚主义作风，他们怕工人提意见，因此不敢对工人进行教育。这时生产情况还很紊乱。经过讨论研究，领导方面又抽调一部分工会干部，加强对工人的宣传教育。这样，工人的觉悟程度提高了，生产情绪也提高了，三月份，该矿即超额完成生产任务。
    为了把今后的生产工作搞得更好，我们建议这个矿的领导干部，继续加强对工人的教育。同时，我们建议领导干部教育技术人员，重视工人的合理化建议。过去修平顺矿河渠时，由于技术人员拒绝工人的合理化建议，以致工程还未修好，就倒塌了。这种偏向应迅速纠正。

    昌平县领导干部忽视护林工作
    连续发生烧山毁林事件
    编辑同志：昌平县领导干部一贯忽视护林工作，以致该县时常发生烧山毁林事件，使国家财产遭受重大损失。
    去年十二月，该县六区车耳营等村曾烧山一万五千多亩，烧毁灌木、柴草三百七十五万斤。但是，这个县的领导干部，在发生这种严重地破坏山林事件后，并没有进行深刻的检讨。
    今年三月四日，政务院发布了防火护林指示。昌平县的干部并没有根据这个指示，加强防火护林工作，以致该县继续不断地发生了烧山事件。仅一、四两区在一个月内（三月初到四月二日），就发生了七次烧山事件。
    河北省人民政府在关于加强护林防火的决定中，曾明确指出：一旦发生山火，当地人民政府就应星夜发动群众，大力予以扑灭，并及时追查责任。但昌平县领导干部在连续发生山火以后，并没有立即派人前往处理。二月二十八日，专区派工作组前往调查森林火灾情况，县领导机关才派了一个干部去配合检查。
    我们认为，昌平县的领导干部，不认真执行上级的护林防火指示，任凭烧山事件不断发生，是十分错误的。因此，我们建议通县专区加强对昌平县护林工作的领导，以防止破坏山林事件的继续发生。

    发动群众造林时要注意划清地界
    编辑同志：划清造林区的界线，是植树造林工作中的一个重要问题。这项工作作不好，就容易造成纠纷，不仅阻碍造林工作的开展，并且会影响县与县、区与区以至村与村之间的团结。例如，三月二十六日，山东华山县第六区范夸村和皖北砀山县蒋营村的农民，就因为地界不清，发生了纠纷。蒋营村的群众由于地界不清，曾在范夸村的沙荒上造林，第二天，范夸村的群众，在蒋营村的沙荒和可耕地上开始造林。蒋营村的群众也就把范夸村群众在他们地界内种的树拔掉了许多。这样就造成很大的人力、物力的浪费，同时影响了双方的造林任务。又如，华山三区的沙荒和沛县部分地区接壤，因两地区界不清，也时常发生越界拾柴和破坏树木的情形。根据这一情况，我建议各地人民政府在发动群众植树造林时，要重视划清地界的工作，以免发生纠纷，影响团结，影响生产。

    河北省武安等地供销合作社
    购棉时不应违反棉价政策
    编辑同志：河北省武安、磁县等地供销合作社，在收购棉花工作中，没有正确执行优棉优价、低棉低价的棉价政策，随意压低等级、衣分，引起棉农不满。武安县各地基层合作社收购霜后籽棉时，每斤少给群众一百元到三百元，群众吃亏很大。该县阑村基层合作社，在今年一月到三月收购籽棉二十多万斤，因为没有执行等级差价和关于衣分的规定，而少给群众一千二百多万元。冯昌等地联村社干部，甚至认为代国家收购棉花时得百分之二点二的手续费过少，竟把从村社运到区社的运费，加在棉农身上，每斤棉花少给二十元到五十元。磁县等地合作社的分级人员，在执行分级工作时，也有“宁高勿低”的思想，他们害怕棉花降级要赔钱。这些地区的合作社，由于在收购棉花时，没有正确执行分级规定，存在严重的单纯营利观点，结果侵犯了棉农利益，引起了棉农的等价思想。有的棉农因为当地压低等级、衣分，宁愿跑到外区去卖，因而影响了棉农的春耕生产。以上现象，是不能容许继续存在的。希望上述地区的上级供销合作社，认真检查一下他们的收购棉花的工作，并立刻采取有效办法，迅速纠正单纯营利观点，以确保棉农利益，完成国家收棉的任务。　韩边
    应纠正强迫群众打井的偏向
    编辑同志：河北省昌平县若干村庄发生了强迫群众摊钱打井的现象。二区双塔村的村干部，领导群众打一眼自流井，强迫群众每亩地出钱两千元引起许多人不满。该县还有二十多个村庄，发生了这种情况。更影响了群众的打井情绪。
    希望昌平县领导机关深入检查，纠正这种偏向。

    苏北合作总社
    应当把农业贷款发给农民
    编辑同志：苏北人民银行新安支行为了扶助农民发展生产，在去年九月中旬，曾请淮阴中心支行拨给农业贷款三亿元。新安支行收到贷款后，除直接贷出一亿零二十六万元外，把余款交给县合作社转苏北合作总社，统一购买铁、木原料，拨给新安铁木厂承制农具。该款拨给苏北合作总社，已有几个月了，但该社一直没有购买铁、木原料供给新安县铁木厂。这不但影响了铁木厂的工作，也影响了今年新安县农业丰产运动的开展。希望有关部门帮助解决这个问题，以免贻误农时。

    各地粮食保管部门应重视粮食保管工作
    编辑同志：在“三反”运动中，有些单位放松了日常业务工作，致使国家财产遭受到不应有的损失。例如：内蒙古呼纳盟粮食公司，在“打虎”期间，仓库潮湿，无人检查，致使仓内面粉受潮硬化，损失数百斤。又扎兰屯粮栈面粉仓库，也因在“打虎”期间，没有指定专人负责粮食保管工作，在下雪时，雪花飘进仓里融化成水，湿了许多斤面粉。这两次事故虽然损失很小，但却是值得提醒大家注意的。我认为各地负责保管粮食的部门都应作一检查。　刘平　刘伟
