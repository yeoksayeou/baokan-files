Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 27th: A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently held a congress of model heroes at the Korean front. The meeting summarized the experiences in combat operations, political work, and logistics work, and celebrated the achievements of combat heroes and people's meritorious workers. Fifty-six first-class combat heroes and first-class people's meritorious workers were awarded military medals by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the meeting.

　　Last autumn, the unit carried out a victorious blocking operation in the Jincheng area of the central front, massively eliminating the enemy's (U.S. aggressor army and its accomplice troops) manpower, and inflicting a devastating blow on the enemy's offensive in the second stage of the autumn offensive. In seventy days of combat, the unit eliminated more than 37,800 enemy troops, shot down or damaged 39 enemy planes, and destroyed or damaged 120 enemy tanks. The unit made the U.S. aggressor army pay a heavy price of 238 casualties for every square kilometer of land it occupied.

　　The widespread campaign to earn merit in this unit greatly inspired and enhanced the troops' awareness of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism. Commanders and fighters expressed their unbreakable fighting will and put forward combat slogans such as "Strive to be steel heroes and bring honor to the motherland!" and "Earn merit for the people of the motherland, avenge the people of Korea, and add glory to Chairman Mao!" During the seventy days of heroic fighting, the unit produced more than 5,300 combat heroes, people's meritorious workers, and 62 collective merit-earning units, including 14 companies that earned first-class merit. The 8th Company of a certain unit defended its position for 29 days, repelled 28 frenzied enemy attacks, and launched nine powerful counterattacks, eliminating more than 600 enemy troops. Liu Dongwu, the deputy platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of the company, once led the entire platoon in bravely repelling a joint attack by an enemy battalion plus two platoons, eight aircraft, and fifteen tanks in a fierce battle. After running out of ammunition, the platoon repelled the enemy's charge with stones and held the position. During the battle, Liu Dongwu was wounded three times but refused to leave the front line. Finally, he detonated an explosive charge and died together with the enemy of two platoon strength, demonstrating the noble qualities of the people's soldiers. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army posthumously recognized Liu Dongwu as a special-class people's hero and named the 2nd Platoon the "Liu Dongwu Hero Platoon." Li Zhanguang, the squad leader of the 6th Squad of a certain company, led his entire squad through three barbed wire fences under artillery fire and climbed a cliff more than 100 meters high in a counterattack, annihilating all 40 enemy soldiers guarding the position, successfully occupying the position, and continuing to repel a counterattack by an enemy platoon. Li Zhanguang played a significant role in the entire battle and was awarded a special-class merit. Li Jingsheng, the squad leader of a certain company, led his entire squad to eliminate 300 enemy soldiers without a single casualty, creating a glorious example of annihilating the enemy and was awarded a first-class merit.

　　All the model heroes unanimously stated at the meeting that they would maintain and carry forward their honor, thoroughly crush the U.S. imperialist germ warfare, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    志愿军某部在前线举行功臣模范代表大会
    五十六名战斗英雄和人民功臣荣获朝鲜政府军功奖章
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军某部最近在朝鲜前线举行了功臣模范代表大会。会上总结了对敌作战、政治工作、后勤工作各方面的经验，同时庆祝战斗英雄和人民功臣的功绩。有五十六名一级战斗英雄和一级人民功臣在会上荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁发的军功奖章。
    去年秋季，该部在中部前线金城一带进行胜利的阻击战，大量地消灭了美国侵略军及其帮凶军的有生力量，并予敌军秋季攻势第二阶段的进攻以歼灭性的打击，在七十天的战斗中，该部共歼敌三万七千八百多名，击落击伤敌机三十九架，击毁击伤敌战车一百二十辆。该部使美国侵略军每侵占一平方公里的土地就要付出二百三十八名伤亡的惨重代价。
    在这个部队中广泛开展的立功运动，大大地启发和提高了部队的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的觉悟，指挥员和战斗员们纷纷表示了坚不可摧的战斗意志，并且提出了“争取做钢铁英雄，把荣誉带给祖国！”“为祖国人民立功，为朝鲜人民复仇，为毛主席增光！”等战斗口号。在七十天的英勇战斗中，该部涌现了五千三百多名战斗英雄、人民功臣和六十二个集体立功的单位，其中有十四个连队立了一等功。某部第八连曾坚守阵地二十九天，击退敌军二十八次疯狂进攻，并举行了九次强力反击，歼灭敌军六百多名。该连第二排副排长刘东武在一次激烈的战斗中，曾率领全排英勇地击退敌军一个营加两个排、八架飞机、十五辆战车的联合进攻。在弹药用尽之后，该排以石块击退敌人的冲锋，坚守了阵地。在战斗中，刘东武三次负伤不下火线，最后拉响爆破筒与两个排兵力的敌人同归于尽，表现了人民战士的高贵品质。志愿军政治部特追认刘东武为特等人民英雄，命名第二排为“刘东武英雄排”。某连第六班班长李占广在一次反击战中，带领全班在炮火下通过三道铁丝网，攀登一百多公尺高的绝壁，全歼守敌四十名，胜利攻占阵地，并继续击退一个排敌人的反击。李占广在整个战斗中起了重大作用，因而荣立特等功。某连班长李景生，带领全班歼敌三百人，而自己无一伤亡，创造了光辉的歼敌战例，因而荣立一等功。
    全体功臣模范在会上一致表示，要保持和发扬荣誉，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战，并为保卫祖国、保卫和平而战斗到底。
