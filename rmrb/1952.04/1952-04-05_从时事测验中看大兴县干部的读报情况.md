    Reading Habits of Daxing County Cadres Seen Through Current Affairs Quiz

    To the Editor: The Propaganda Department of the Daxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei recently held a current affairs quiz for cadres. A total of one hundred and forty-five people participated in this quiz. This included cadres from the Daxing County Committee, the County People's Government, the Third District People's Government, and their affiliated units. Among them were twenty section-level cadres. The results of the quiz were: fifty-four people passed, accounting for a little over thirty-seven percent of the participants; twenty-seven people scored below thirty points, accounting for eighteen percent; these comrades are mostly engaged in receiving and dispatching mail, communications, and other technical work, and their educational level is relatively low; the remaining comrades generally answered about half of the general content of the test questions correctly.

    The Daxing County Committee Propaganda Department pays relatively close attention to cadres' newspaper reading and study. Usually, the various organs in the county can adhere to the one-hour daily newspaper reading study system, but since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, study has become somewhat laissez-faire. Through this quiz, we believe that the cadres' newspaper reading and study in the county, in addition to establishing a regular system, must be further strengthened in the following three aspects.

    First, cadres should be educated not only to know the facts published in the newspaper but also to recognize the essence of the issues. The standard for assessing the test scores in Daxing County this time was that as long as the general facts of the questions asked were answered correctly, a high score could be obtained. For example, in answering the "Ji Kaifu Incident," as long as the following meaning could be answered: "This is an incident of leading cadres shielding corruption and theft, and framing others. It happened in Wuhan City and was finally exposed in the great 'Three-Anti' movement," it could be rated as an excellent score. However, in all the test papers, very few people recognized that this serious conspiracy of framing and retaliatory behavior of violating laws and discipline was a remnant influence of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule and an inevitable result of the bourgeois ideology's poisonous erosion of our party and leading organs. Nor did anyone mention that the correct handling of this matter by the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee forcefully proved that the Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will never be corrupt and will always develop healthily.

    Second, the study of policies must be strengthened. Many of the test questions involved the current agricultural production policies, but many people answered poorly. For example, when asked about the basic guidelines for agricultural production in 1952, some people answered "preventing drought," "afforestation," or "water conservancy," and although most people answered correctly, their understanding of the issue was very abstract. For example, some cadres in the Third District confused "increasing yield per unit area" with creating high-yield land, mistakenly interpreting it as each farmer setting aside one or two mu of land for intensive cultivation to increase yield.

    Third, during intense political movements and production movements, newspaper reading and study should be further strengthened. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many comrades were indeed very busy, but it is wrong to use "busy" as an excuse not to read the newspaper because the Party newspaper is a powerful weapon for guiding the movement. The fact that Daxing County relaxed the leadership of newspaper reading and study during the "Three-Anti" movement shows that the leading cadres of the county still do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of the Party newspaper as a weapon for guiding work and educating the masses.

### 从时事测验中看大兴县干部的读报情况

    从时事测验中看大兴县干部的读报情况
    编辑同志：中共河北大兴县委宣传部最近在干部中举行了一次时事测验。参加这次测验的共一百四十五人。包括大兴县委员会、县人民政府、第三区人民政府及其所属各单位干部。其中科长级干部二十人。测验结果是：五十四人及格，占参加人数的百分之三十七强；三十分以下者二十七人，占百分之十八；这些同志多是作收发、通讯及其他技术工作的，他们的文化水平都比较低；其余的同志，一般都能答对半数考题的一般内容。
    大兴县委宣传部对干部的读报学习是比较重视的。平时，该县各机关都能坚持每天读报一小时的学习制度，但是，自从开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动以来，学习就有些自流了。通过这次测验，我们认为该县干部的读报学习，除了应该建立经常的制度外，并须从以下三个方面来继续加强。
    第一，教育干部不但要知道报上所刊载的事实，而且要认识问题的本质。大兴县这次评定测验成绩的标准是，只要答对所问问题的一般事实，就可以获得较高的分数。例如“纪凯夫事件”的答题，只要能答出以下意思：“这是一件领导干部包庇贪污、盗窃分子，嫁祸于人的事件。发生在武汉市，终于在伟大的‘三反’运动中被揭发出来”，就可以被评为优等分。但全部考卷中，很少有人认识到这件严重的阴谋陷害和违法乱纪的报复行为，是国民党反动派统治的残余影响，是资产阶级思想的污毒侵蚀我们党和领导机关的必然结果。也没有人提到，中共中央中南局对这件事的正确处理，正是有力地证明了：经过马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党是永远不会腐化的，是永远健康地向前发展的。
    第二，必须加强政策的学习。测验题中，有许多是涉及当前农业生产政策的，但不少人答得很不好。如问一九五二年农业生产的基本方针时，有些人竟答为“防旱抗旱”、“造林”或“兴修水利”，大多数人虽答得正确，但对问题的了解却很抽象。比如三区某些干部，把“提高单位面积产量”和创造丰产地混淆不清，他们错误地把它解释为每个农民抽出一亩或二亩地来精耕细作，使之提高产量。
    第三，在紧张的政治运动和生产运动中，更要加强读报学习。在“三反”和“五反”运动中，许多同志确实很忙，但藉口“忙”而不读报，则是错误的，因为党报正是指导运动的有力武器。大兴县在“三反”运动中放松了读报学习的领导，正说明了该县领导干部对党报是指导工作、教育群众的武器的重要意义还认识不足。  杨林
