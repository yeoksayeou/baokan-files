(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 22nd) On the first day of the resumed administrative meeting on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations (April 19th), the U.S. side once again resorted to its old trick from the beginning of the administrative meetings, continuing to violate the agreement between the two sides that the specific content of the administrative meetings should not be published to the press. Through the American news agency, United Press, it illegally and unilaterally hinted at the content of the administrative meeting, attempting to carry out deceptive propaganda for its conspiracy to insist on the absurd and unreasonable so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposal, in order to achieve its despicable goal of continuing to obstruct the armistice negotiations.

In its Panmunjom dispatch on the 19th, United Press, in the name of so-called "observers in Panmunjom," revealed the lists of prisoners of war to be exchanged after the ceasefire, which were proposed by both sides at the administrative meeting. It also openly promoted the shameful conspiracy of the U.S. side to detain our captured personnel, saying: "The Allied forces deleted the names of prisoners of war who did not want to be repatriated from the list (of December 18th of last year)." The spokesman of Ridgway's headquarters—the so-called "observers in Panmunjom"—shamelessly propagandized that the U.S. side's despicable and insidious act of arbitrarily deleting our prisoner of war list was seeking some kind of "compromise solution," and slanderously called it a "face-saving method."

Even based on this illegally conducted unilateral propaganda by the U.S. side, it is not difficult to see that after a two-week recess, the U.S. side not only did not change its unreasonable demand for "voluntary repatriation," but also attempted to enforce it. Obviously, our captured personnel deleted from the original list by the U.S. side will all be forcibly detained by the U.S. side, and the result is no different from "voluntary repatriation."

This malicious so-called "compromise solution" of the U.S. side was meticulously planned. On April 3rd, the U.S. side requested a temporary suspension of the administrative meeting; on the same day, the commander of the U.S. invasion forces in Korea, Ridgway, flew from Tokyo, Japan, to Munsan, Korea, and convened a meeting of senior generals. According to a Reuters Munsan dispatch on the 3rd, Ridgway's trip was "not unrelated to the sudden postponement of the secret meeting on the exchange of prisoners of war originally scheduled to be held in Panmunjom today." After the meeting, Ridgway's headquarters stepped up the preparation of a "new list" of our prisoners of war. A United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 7th revealed that "The new list submitted by the United Nations forces may not include the names of prisoners who do not wish to be repatriated to the communist side." "In this way, the United Nations forces can hand over all the prisoners of war whose names appear on the roster without undermining the principle of voluntary repatriation." It is crystal clear that the U.S. side is trying to use the "new list" to forcibly implement its absurd proposal of "voluntary repatriation."

Since the start of the negotiations on the fourth item, the U.S. side's absurd proposal of so-called "voluntary repatriation" has been full of loopholes and untenable under our constant exposure and the condemnation of the people of the world. Under these circumstances, even the U.S.'s satellite countries have recently felt guilty about the U.S. aggressors' unreasonable insistence on this absurd proposal. According to a report in the "Washington Daily News" on the 10th, Britain, France, and Canada are asking "the United States to agree to the communist demand in the Korean armistice talks to repatriate all prisoners of war," because "refusing to repatriate 'all' prisoners of war could violate the Geneva Convention." An Associated Press Ottawa dispatch on the 10th also said: Canada has drawn the attention of the United States to the fact that "the U.S. prisoner of war policy in the Korean armistice negotiations is not in accordance with the Geneva Convention." "The Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war must be sent back to their home country. It does not provide, as the United States has suggested in Korea, that communist prisoners of war who do not wish to return home for political or other reasons do not have to return home." However, the U.S. side disregards all this, on the one hand, it uses the confidential nature of the administrative meeting to deliberately create an optimistic atmosphere, and pretends to have the intention to solve the problem to deceive and paralyze the people of the world, and to deceive its so-called allied countries. On the other hand, it shamelessly changes its appearance, using the so-called "new list" and "compromise solution" as a cloak, attempting to carry out the reality of "voluntary repatriation" without the name of illegal "voluntary repatriation." This sinister conspiracy is absolutely impossible to succeed, it can only arouse greater anger from the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.

More and more news is being revealed: the reason why the U.S. side insists on the absurd proposal of "voluntary repatriation" in many ways is to forcibly detain our captured personnel and send them to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder for aggression. According to a Reuters Taipei dispatch on the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek received a fabricated "blood letter" from captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, which stated: "If possible, incorporate them (referring to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers) into the Kuomintang army." An Associated Press Taipei dispatch on the 16th said even more bluntly: "Nationalist China not only opposes forced exchange of prisoners of war, but is also prepared to accept all Chinese communist prisoners of war who have been screened by the Allied forces and are willing to participate in the struggle against communism to come to Taiwan." Similar fabricated letters also appeared in Busan, where the Syngman Rhee puppet government is located. The criminal face of the U.S. aggressors colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs in a conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel has once again been exposed to the people of the world.

Our side initially accepted the U.S. side's request to hold an administrative meeting in order to achieve a smooth resolution of the issue of repatriating and releasing prisoners of war, which has been consistently obstructed by the U.S. side. Even from the situation of the administrative meeting illegally revealed by the U.S. side, it can be seen that at the beginning of the resumption of this meeting, our side continued to work for the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides in accordance with international conventions and humanitarian principles; however, the U.S. side still has no sincerity in solving the problem, continues to adhere to its absurd proposal of "voluntary repatriation," and unreasonably delays the early completion of the fourth item and the entire armistice negotiations.

We resolutely oppose the U.S. side's disguised insistence on its "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy. The U.S. side must abandon all disguised and rebranded absurd proposals of "voluntary repatriation" so that the fourth item can reach a fair and reasonable agreement as soon as possible; otherwise, the U.S. side must be responsible for all the consequences of delaying the negotiations.

### 继续破坏行政性会议协议进行欺骗宣传  美方阴谋变相扣留我方被俘人员  美方如不放弃荒谬主张必须对拖延谈判负全责

    继续破坏行政性会议协议进行欺骗宣传
    美方阴谋变相扣留我方被俘人员
    美方如不放弃荒谬主张必须对拖延谈判负全责
    【新华社开城二十二日电】在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程行政性会议复会的第一天（十九日），美方竟又施展其在行政性会议初开时的故技，继续破坏双方关于行政性会议的具体内容不得向新闻界发表的协议。通过美国通讯社合众社，非法而片面地暗示行政性会议的内容，妄图为其坚持荒谬无理的所谓“自愿遣返”的主张的阴谋进行欺骗宣传，以达到其继续阻挠停战谈判的卑鄙目的。
    合众社在它的板门店十九日电中，以所谓“板门店的观察家”的名义透露双方在行政性会议上提出停火后交换的战俘名单，并公开宣传美方扣留我方被俘人员的可耻阴谋说：“联军从（去年十二月十八日的）名单中把不愿遣回的战俘名字删去”。李奇微总部的代言人——所谓“板门店的观察家”无耻地宣传说，美方这种卑鄙阴险的擅自删改我方战俘名单的勾当是寻求什么“折衷方案”，并污蔑地称之为“保全面子的方法”。
    即使根据美方这一非法进行的片面宣传，人们还是不难看出：经过半个月的休会后，美方不仅没有改变其“自愿遣返”的无理要求，而且竟进而企图强制实行。显然，被美方从原来的名单中删去的我方被俘人员，将全部被美方强迫扣留，其结果与“自愿遣返”毫无二致。
    美方这种恶毒的所谓“折衷方案”，是经过缜密筹划的。四月三日，美方要求行政性会议暂时停开；就在这一天，侵朝美军总司令李奇微从日本东京飞抵朝鲜汶山，召开了高级将领会议。据路透社汶山三日电透露，李奇微此行“与原定今天在板门店举行的讨论交换战俘问题的秘密会议突然延期不无关系”。会议之后，李奇微总部就加紧编制关于我方战俘的“新名单”。合众社东京七日电即已透露，“联合国军提出的新名单可能不包括不愿被遣返到共方那里去的俘虏的姓名在内”。“这样一来，联合国军就可以交出姓名见于名册的全部战俘，而不致破坏自愿遣返的原则。”美方企图利用“新名单”来强行其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，是再明白也没有了。
    自从第四项议程谈判开始以来，在我方的不断揭发和全世界人民的指责下，美方的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，早已漏洞百出，站不住脚了。在这种情况下，最近甚至美国的仆从国家对美国侵略者无理坚持这一荒谬主张，也感到心虚。据十日
    “华盛顿每日新闻”消息，英国、法国和加拿大正要求“美国同意共党在朝鲜停战会谈中所提遣返所有战俘的要求”，因为“拒绝遣返‘所有’的战俘可能破坏日内瓦公约”。美联社渥太华十日电也说：加拿大已提请美国注意：“美国在朝鲜停战谈判中的战俘政策是不符合日内瓦公约的”。“日内瓦公约规定：战俘须送回他们的祖国。它并没有作出如美国在朝鲜所建议的那样规定——凡因政治或其他原因不愿回国的共军俘虏，可以不必回国。”可是美方竟不顾这一切，一面利用行政会议的机密性质，故意伪造乐观空气，并装出一付有意解决问题的外貌来欺骗和麻痹世界人民，并蒙蔽其所谓同盟友邦，另一方面，又无耻地改头换面，以所谓“新名单”和“折衷方案”为外衣，企图不用非法的“自愿遣返”的名义，而行其“自愿遣返”之实，这种险恶的阴谋是绝对不能得逞的，它只能激起中朝人民和世界人民的更大的愤怒。
    愈来愈多的消息暴露出来：美方所以多方坚持“自愿遣返”的荒唐主张，其目的在于强迫扣留我方被俘人员，把他们送交给台湾国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮，充当侵略炮灰。据路透社台北十二日电，蒋匪收到一封捏造的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的“血书”，内称：“如果可能的话，将他们（按指中国人民志愿军被俘人员）编入国民党部队”。美联社台北十六日电更加露骨地说：“国民党中国不仅反对强迫交换俘虏，并准备接受为联军甄别过，愿意参加反对共产主义斗争的所有中共俘虏到来台湾。”性质类似的捏造信，也出现在李承晚傀儡政府所在地的釜山。美国侵略者与蒋李匪帮勾结，阴谋强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶面目，再次暴露在全世界人民的面前了。
    我方当初接受美方关于举行行政性会议的要求，原为求得一贯为美方所阻挠的遣返并释放战俘问题得以顺利解决。即使从美方非法透露的行政性会议的情形看来，我方在这一会议复会之初，就继续为合乎国际公约和人道原则的全部遣返双方战俘的原则而努力；但是美方仍无丝毫解决问题的诚意，继续坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，无理拖延第四项议程和整个停战谈判的早日完成。
    美方变相地坚持其“自愿遣返”的阴谋，是我们所坚决反对的。美方必须放弃一切改头换面的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，以便第四项议程能早日达成公平合理的协议，否则，美方必须对拖延谈判的一切后果负责。
