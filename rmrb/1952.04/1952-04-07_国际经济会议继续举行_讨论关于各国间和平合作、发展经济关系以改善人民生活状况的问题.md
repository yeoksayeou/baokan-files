Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 6th: The International Economic Conference continued its plenary session on the 4th, chaired by Polish representative Lange and Brazilian representative Oliveira. The conference discussed the issue of "seeking possibilities to improve people's livelihoods through peaceful cooperation among nations and various systems, and through developing economic relations among nations."

	French representative Professor Debré spoke first. He pointed out: We believe that this conference will certainly be regarded as a major event of historical significance in the future. France is particularly concerned about foreign trade. Before 1939, France relied on income from foreign investments to meet its foreign exchange needs. Later, the needs of the war forced it to exhaust this wealth. Therefore, at the end of the war, it had to use exports to compensate for imports. However, despite such measures, France's foreign trade deficit increased from 102 billion francs in 1950 to 339 billion francs in 1951. In the first half of 1951, 58 percent of France's dollar imports could be offset by its dollar exports, while in December of the same year, only 36 percent could be offset by dollar exports. Neither dollar loans, nor expanding trade with the United States, nor developing multilateral trade among Western European countries on the basis of the European Payments Union, can fundamentally solve France's and Western European countries' difficulties in international payments. The experience of the past few years has proven that it is very necessary to carry out genuine expanded trade on the basis of equality among participating countries. Debré finally talked about France's economic needs and export capabilities.

	Professor Halasinski, the president of the University of Łódź in Poland, briefly described the development of Poland's post-war economy in his speech. He said: Poland used to be a backward agricultural country, but it is now rapidly transforming into an industrial and agricultural country. In 1951, the production volume of Poland's large and medium-sized industries exceeded pre-war levels by more than one and a half times. Agricultural output exceeded pre-war levels in 1949. On the other hand, Poland is carrying out intensive industrial construction and extensive mechanization of agriculture. This situation makes Poland a good market for products of foreign machine manufacturing industries and transportation equipment. Poland's foreign trade volume has increased rapidly, and currently this trade volume has exceeded 200 percent of that in 1937. After describing the importance of Polish coal, food, agricultural products, and timber to Western European countries, Halasinski said: In general, the total value of Poland's exports to capitalist countries from 1953 to 1955 may exceed 2 billion rubles per year. If Poland's exports are to reach this level, Poland must be able to import goods equivalent to those it imported between 1947 and 1949.

	Mr. ویکلی, General Manager of an American Electrical and Chemical Import and Export Company, spoke next. He said: I personally hope to restore free and unhindered international trade, to abolish all import and export tariff barriers, and to completely let the needs of consumers determine production and supply; no group should enjoy privileges. The ugly reality we are facing now is that nearly half of the world's people go to bed hungry every night, and in India and many other parts of the world, people even starve to death. Although we know that the splitting of the atom can be used as a tool to improve life instead of killing people, we live in the terrifying shadow of the atomic bomb. Although theoretically speaking, it is now a time of peace, we are uneasy because today's world lives in a war economy, and economic resources are used to manufacture war tools. Mr. ویکلی pointed out: In the United States, we have heard a lot about the so-called "Iron Curtain." If there really is a wall between the East and the West, then we must remember that all walls have two sides; and we must remember that just one layer of curtain cannot hide, protect, or cover anything. Mr. ویکلی also said: Most of the industrial and commercial figures in the United States, like the vast majority of people in other sectors, believe that launching a new world war is completely insane. They know that modern warfare not only destroys production and trade, but also that the purpose of war must be to kill people, to kill millions of people as producers and consumers; and industry and commerce originally existed for producers and consumers. Every consumer in the world is an actual customer or a potential customer. If a businessman wants to shoot his customers, then he must be prepared to put on a straitjacket and enter an insane asylum. Mr. ویکلی emphasized: Only when we are prepared to exchange our culture and work results will true peace come. This conference should try to promote the free and equal exchange of goods without restriction and discrimination, and strive to ensure international peace.

	Next, Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation and president of the People's Bank of China, delivered a speech.

	The conference then listened to speeches by Austrian industrialist Schacher and Czech National Bank President Bauer. Bauer emphasized that one of the most important reasons for the abnormal international economic situation is the trade restrictions imposed by some countries on the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. However, these discriminatory measures have not achieved the expected goals, but have seriously hindered the economic development of the countries implementing these measures and have seriously lowered the living standards of their people. Bauer then talked about the development of Czechoslovakia's national economy and foreign trade. He said: Without trading with countries that pursue discriminatory policies, Czechoslovakia's foreign trade volume in 1951 almost exceeded the 1937 level by one time. Czechoslovakia has all the necessary conditions to restore full trade relations with several countries. If normal conditions for international trade relations can be established, then we will definitely be able to conduct trade with capitalist countries amounting to 900 million or even 1 billion US dollars in the next two to three years. We are willing to use all means to develop peaceful economic relations between our country and all other countries.

	The meeting ended here on the next day. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 5th.

### 国际经济会议继续举行  讨论关于各国间和平合作、发展经济关系以改善人民生活状况的问题

    国际经济会议继续举行
    讨论关于各国间和平合作、发展经济关系以改善人民生活状况的问题
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际经济会议在四日继续举行全体会议，由波兰代表兰基和巴西代表奥立维拉任主席。会议讨论了关于“经由各国间和各种制度间的和平合作，经由发展各国间的经济关系来寻求改善人民生活状况的可能性”的问题。
    法国代表德伯拉教授首先发言。他指出：我们相信这个会议将来是一定要被人们看成具有历史意义的大事的。法国特别关心对外贸易。一九三九年以前，法国靠从国外投资方面的收入来满足它的外汇需要。后来战争的需要迫使它耗尽这种财产。因此战争结束时它不得不用输出来弥补输入。但是，尽管采取这样的措施，法国对外贸易逆差仍由一九五○年的一千零二十亿法郎增加到一九五一年的三千三百九十亿法郎。在一九五一年上半年，法国的美元入口有百分之五十八可以由它的美元出口来弥补，而在同年十二月，可以由美元出口来弥补的就只有百分之三十六了。不论是美元贷款，或是扩大和美国的贸易，以及在欧洲支付同盟的基础上发展西欧各国之间的多边贸易，都不能根本解决法国和西欧各国在国际支付方面的困难。过去几年的经验证明，在参与国彼此平等的基础上进行真正的扩大贸易，是非常必要的。德伯拉最后谈到了法国经济的需要和出口的能力。
    波兰罗兹大学校长哈拉辛斯基教授在发言中简叙了波兰战后经济的发展情况。他说：波兰以前是落后的农业国，现在正迅速地转变成为工、农业国家。在一九五一年，波兰大型和中等工业的生产量已超过了战前水平的一倍半以上。农业产量在一九四九年就超过了战前水平。另一方面，波兰正在进行紧张的工业建设和农业的广泛机械化工作。这种情况使得波兰成为外国机器制造工业的产品和运输装备的良好市场。波兰的对外贸易额已迅速增加，目前这项贸易额已超过了一九三七年百分之二百。哈拉辛斯基在叙述波兰的煤、食品、农产品和木材对西欧国家的重要性之后说：总的说来，一九五三年到一九五五年波兰对资本主义国家的输出总值，
    每年可能超过二十亿卢布。如果要使波兰的输出达到这个水平，就必须使波兰能输入相当于波兰在一九四七年到一九四九年间输入的货物。
    美国某电气与化学进出口公司总经理维克利接着发言。他说：我个人希望恢复自由而不受阻碍的国际贸易，希望废除一切进出口关税壁垒，完全让消费者的需要决定生产和供应；任何集团不应享有特权。我们现在所面对的丑恶现实是：世界将近一半的人民每天晚上饿着肚子睡觉，在印度和世界其他许多地方，甚至还有人饿死。虽然我们知道原子的分裂是可以用作改善生活而不用作杀人的工具的，可是我们却生活在原子弹的恐怖阴影下。虽然理论上说来，现在是和平时期，可是我们心中不安，因为今天的世界生活在战争经济之中，经济资源都被用去制造战争工具了。维克利指出：在美国，我们听了许多关于所谓“铁幕”的话。如果说在东方和西方之间真的有墙的话，那末我们必须记住，所有的墙都是有两面的；也必须记住，仅仅一层幕是藏不住、护不住、也遮不住任何东西的。维克利又说：美国大多数的工商业人士，和其他各界的绝大多数人民一样，认为进行新的世界大战完全是疯狂的事。他们知道，现代的战争不仅破坏生产和贸易，而且，战争的目的一定是屠杀人民，成百万地屠杀作为生产者和消费者的人民；而工商业原来就是为了生产者和消费者才存在的。世界上每一个消费者都是实际的顾客或可能的顾客。做生意的人如果要开枪打他的顾客，那末他一定准备穿疯人衣进疯人院了。维克利强调说：只有在我们准备交流我们的文化和工作成果时，真正的和平才会到来。这次会议应当设法促成在不受限制和歧视的情况下进行货物的自由和平等的交换，并努力保证国际和平。
    接着中国代表团团长、中国人民银行行长南汉宸发表了演说。
    会议继听取了奥地利工业家沙希纳和捷克斯洛伐克国家银行总裁鲍尔的发言。鲍尔强调指出：国际经济情况不正常的最重要原因之一，是某些国家对苏联和人民民主国家所实行的贸易限制。但是，这些歧视措施并没有达成预期的目的，反而严重地妨碍了实行这些措施的国家的经济发展，并严重地降低了它们的人民的生活水准。鲍尔接着谈到捷克斯洛伐克国民经济和对外贸易的发展情况。他说：在没有与奉行歧视政策的国家进行贸易的情况下，捷克斯洛伐克一九五一年对外贸易额竟几乎超过一九三七年水平一倍。捷克斯洛伐克具有恢复对若干国家的充分贸易关系的一切必要条件。如果国际贸易关系的正常条件得以建立，那末我们在未来两三年当中一定可以和资本主义国家进行数达九亿，甚至十亿美元的贸易。我们愿意用一切办法来发展我国和其他一切国家之间的和平经济关系。
    第二天会议至此结束，下次会议定于五日举行。
