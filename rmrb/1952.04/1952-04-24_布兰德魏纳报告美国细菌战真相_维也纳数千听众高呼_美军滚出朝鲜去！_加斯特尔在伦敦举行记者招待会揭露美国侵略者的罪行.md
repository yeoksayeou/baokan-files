Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd Dispatch: TASS, Vienna—As previously reported, the American occupation authorities had forbidden Professor Brandweiner, head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigative team, from presenting a report on the investigative findings regarding the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare in Korea at the Vienna City American Occupation Zone's Expo Palace.

Brandweiner delivered his report on the evening of April 21st at the Scala Theater. That theater could only accommodate one-tenth of the people who came to hear his report. Thousands of working people had to listen to the report of this dauntless peace fighter through loudspeakers placed on the streets.

Professor Brandweiner reported in detail the investigative results of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigative team regarding the heinous crimes committed by the American armed forces against the Korean people. He said: The investigative team collected a large amount of on-site evidence. This evidence irrefutably proves that the United States is using bacteriological weapons and poison gas on a large scale in Korea. This action seriously violates international law and constitutes a crime against all mankind. This crime has greatly angered all righteous people around the world. We firmly protest this sinful act by the Americans and demand an immediate end to the bacteriological warfare in Korea.

Austrian Member of Parliament Fischer also gave a speech to the audience. On behalf of all Austrian peace fighters, he warmly thanked Professor Brandweiner for his active actions in defending peace, especially for his activities as the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigative team. Fischer said: The fact that the Americans forbade Professor Brandweiner from giving a report in the American occupation zone of Vienna clearly proves that they are very afraid of the terrible truth of the crimes they committed in Korea and China being revealed.

Professor Brandweiner's and Fischer's speeches were repeatedly interrupted by the audience's thunderous applause, and the audience shouted: "Yankees get out of Korea! Stop bacteriological warfare! Plague spreaders—Americans get out of Austria! Long live world peace!"

Finally, a letter from the Austrian Peace Council to the people of the whole country was read out at the meeting, part of which said:

"The Austrian Peace Council welcomes the courageous actions of Professor Brandweiner, a member of the Executive Bureau of the Austrian Peace Council. He actively participated in the investigation of the inhumane crimes committed by the American armed forces under the banner of the United Nations in North Korea and Northeast China.

The Austrian Peace Council fully agrees with the resolution adopted by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council at its Oslo meeting, firmly protests against the use of bacteriological weapons by the American armed forces, and supports the proposal to organize an international committee of renowned experts to investigate on the spot the facts of the Americans' bacteriological warfare."

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd Dispatch: TASS, London, April 23rd—Gaster, a British lawyer and member of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigative team who recently visited North Korea and Northeast China, held a press conference in London.

Gaster distributed to reporters a detailed report written by the investigative team on the atrocities of the American aggressors. Gaster said: "The investigation was conducted with the strict attitude that legal workers must have when investigating facts and witnesses. In this report, no fact about any atrocity has not been proven before members of the investigation team by direct witnesses. Any case based on indirect evidence or that we considered to have even a trace of doubt was not included in the report.

The unanimous conclusion of the investigation team is: the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea and Northeast China has been irrefutably proven."

Gaster said: The investigation team's investigation "discovered many shocking crimes by the American army in Korea," the seriousness of which makes it necessary for us to publicly expose the way the entire American military operation is conducted and bring the criminals who committed these atrocities to trial.

Gaster continued: "This is the most terrible experience of my life, and I believe I will never encounter such a thing again in the future. All kinds of accounts of the people's suffering, destruction, and atrocities are beyond anything I could have imagined. I know that there will definitely be some people who attack the honesty of our investigation team members, but I don't care. The more vicious the attack, the more obvious it becomes how eager some people are to prevent the facts from being made public."

    布兰德魏纳报告美国细菌战真相
    维也纳数千听众高呼“美军滚出朝鲜去！”
    加斯特尔在伦敦举行记者招待会揭露美国侵略者的罪行
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：前已报道，美国占领当局曾禁止国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长布兰德魏纳教授在维也纳市美国占领区博览宫发表关于美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实调查结果的报告。
    布兰德魏纳于四月二十一日晚间在斯加拉剧院作了他的报告。那个剧院只能容得下前往听他报告的人的十分之一。几千劳动人民只好借着安置在街上的扩音器听取这位大无畏的和平战士的报告。
    布兰德魏纳教授详细地报告了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团对美国武装部队对朝鲜人民所犯下的滔天罪行的调查结果。他说：调查团在现场搜集了大量的实证。这些实证无可辩驳地证明了美国正在朝鲜大规模使用细菌武器和毒气。他们的这种行动，就是严重地破坏了国际法，就是犯了与全人类为敌的罪行。这种罪行，大大地激怒了全世界一切正直人民。我们坚决抗议美国人的这种罪恶行为，并要求立即停止在朝鲜所进行的细菌战。
    奥地利议会议员费希尔也向听众发表了演说。他代表奥地利全体和平战士，热烈地向布兰德魏纳教授致谢，感谢他的保卫和平的积极行动，特别是感谢他以国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长的资格所进行的活动。费希尔说：美国人禁止布兰德魏纳教授在维也纳的美国占领区内作报告这一个事实，明显地证明了他们非常恐惧有人揭露他们在朝鲜和中国所犯的罪行的可怕真相。
    布兰德魏纳教授和费希尔的演说一再为听众的暴风雨般的掌声所打断，听众高呼：“美国人滚出朝鲜！停止细菌战！瘟疫散布者——美国人滚出奥地利！世界和平万岁！”
    最后，会上宣读了奥地利和平理事会告全国人民书，其中一部分说：
    “奥地利和平理事会欢迎奥地利和平理事会执行局委员布兰德魏纳教授的勇敢行为。他积极地参加了调查美国武装部队打着联合国旗帜在北朝鲜和中国东北所犯下的惨无人道的罪行。
    奥地利和平理事会完全同意世界和平理事会执行局在它的奥斯陆会议上所通过的决议，坚决抗议美国武装部队使用细菌武器，并且拥护主张由著名专家组织一个国际委员会实地调查美国人进行细菌战的事实的建议。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十三日讯：最近访问过朝鲜北部和中国东北的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团员、英国律师加斯特尔，在伦敦举行记者招待会。
    加斯特尔向记者们分发调查团写就的一份关于美国侵略者暴行详尽材料的报告。加斯特尔说：“调查是在法律工作者在调查事实和目击者时所必须具有的严格态度下进行的。在这份报告中，没有一个关于任何暴行的事实不是经过直接目击者在调查团团员前面予以证明的。凡是根据间接证明或是我们认为有一丝一毫可疑的案件，我们都没有收入报告。
    调查团的一致的结论是：美国军队在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器，已是无可辩驳地被证实了的事。”
    加斯特尔说：调查团的调查“发现了美国军队在朝鲜的许多惊人罪行”，其性质之严重使得我们必须公开揭露美国整个军事行动的进行方式，把制造这些暴行的罪犯交付审讯。
    加斯特尔继续说：“这是我一生中最可怖的一次经历，我相信我今后永远不要再碰到这种事了。种种关于人民的惨况、破坏和暴行的叙述，都是我无论如何也想像不到的。我知道，一定会有一些人攻击我们调查团团员的诚实，但是我并不在乎。攻击愈是恶毒，也就愈加明显地表明了某些人是如何急于要阻止事实公诸于世。”
