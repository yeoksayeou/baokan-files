The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has awarded Comrade Qi Jianhua, the creator of the rapid literacy method, a certificate of merit in order to universally promote the rapid literacy method. This is a major event in the cultural and educational cause of our people.

The rapid literacy method is a good method for quickly eliminating illiteracy created by Comrade Qi Jianhua, a cultural instructor of a unit of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, based on practical experience in literacy teaching in the army since 1949. It has extremely important significance and effect on the development of cultural education for workers, peasants and soldiers in our country.

Eliminating illiteracy and popularizing culture are urgent tasks of our people's cultural and educational work. Chairman Mao instructed us long ago in "On Coalition Government": "Eliminating illiteracy from 80% of the population is a necessary condition for building a new China." Chairman Mao clearly stipulated in the "Directive of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission on Implementing Cultural Education in the Army" issued on August 1, 1950: "On-the-job and off-the-job cultural learning and education should all adopt the educational policy of being rapid, practical, and yet formal." The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government also promulgated the "Directive on Carrying Out Spare-time Education for Staff and Workers" on June 1, 1950. In the past two years, under the leadership of the people's government's cultural and educational policies, cultural and educational workers in our country have continuously strived to eliminate illiteracy and popularize culture, making great progress in the cultural education of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country. However, because Chinese characters are difficult to learn, there are still many difficulties in the work of eliminating illiteracy. The creation and experimental effect of the "Rapid Literacy Method" will undoubtedly greatly accelerate the realization of the task of eliminating illiteracy and will rapidly promote the development of cultural education for workers, peasants and soldiers. This will have an important impact on the construction of industry, agriculture, and national defense in our country.

The reason why Comrade Qi Jianhua was able to create the "Rapid Literacy Method" is because he correctly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and implemented the teaching policy of linking with reality and following the mass line. With the continuous improvement of the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of workers, peasants and soldiers in our country, their demand for learning culture is becoming increasingly urgent, and they want it as soon as possible. Starting from this basic situation, Comrade Qi Jianhua further studied the characteristics of adult illiterates, combined his own practical experience in learning Chinese, boldly created "rapid" literacy teaching methods, and with the encouragement and help of the Party, after many experiments, finally produced the current rapid literacy method. Over the past year, this literacy method has achieved excellent results in experiments in various places. Under normal circumstances, if this method is used to teach an illiterate person, it only takes about 150 hours to recognize 1,500 to 2,000 characters, and another 100 hours to read four to six literacy textbooks. They can understand popular books and periodicals, and can write simple letters and articles. For example, the machine gun company of a unit of the Shandong Military Region eliminated illiteracy in the entire company after three weeks of 150 hours of study; 24 students in a textile worker study class in Chongqing increased from an average of 454 characters recognized to 2,021 characters after 22 days of 184 hours of study, and were able to write short letters and read popular newspapers. A cotton textile worker study class in Tianjin increased from an average of 522 characters to 2,108 characters after 23 days of study. The results of experiments in many other regions have proved to be similar. It can be seen that the value of the "Rapid Literacy Method" has been affirmed by facts.

Therefore, we have every reason to determine that the rapid literacy method should be universally promoted in winter schools, worker-peasant rapid primary schools, staff and worker spare-time schools, and peasant spare-time schools throughout the country.

In order to universally promote the rapid literacy method, we should first, on a national scale, use various tools (newspapers, periodicals, movies, records, comic strips, radio, etc.) and through various means to publicize the content, advantages, and effects of the rapid literacy method, and introduce typical experiences and vivid examples from various places, so that working cadres and the broad masses of people in various places know the important value of the rapid literacy method.

According to the existing experience in various places, when organizing the masses to use the rapid literacy method for learning, we must conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, and on the basis of the masses' political consciousness, production enthusiasm, and urgent demand for learning culture, further improve their consciousness and initiative, use practical examples to illustrate the benefits of the rapid literacy method, eliminate their lack of confidence in adult learning culture and other ideological concerns, and strengthen their learning confidence. This ideological mobilization work must be carried out frequently in light of the actual ideological situation of the students during the learning process.

While promoting the teaching of the rapid literacy method, we must pay attention to consolidating the results of learning. According to the experience of various regions, to consolidate the results of rapid literacy, we mainly rely on frequent reading of books, newspapers, and popular literature and art after literacy. Therefore, relevant cultural education and publishing departments must plan to compile and print a large number of appropriate popular reading materials and publish dictionaries with phonetic alphabets for the masses to read, so that they will not only not forget the characters they have already recognized, but also be able to continuously improve their literacy and cultural level through frequent reading.

The creation and promotion of the rapid literacy method will bring about great reforms in the system of worker-peasant spare-time education in our country. The length of study in worker-peasant primary spare-time schools will be shortened, winter schools will become schools that can truly eliminate a group of illiterates in one winter, and will be developed more extensively. More new experiences will be drawn from the teaching methods. All of this requires educators to continue to work hard to study.

### 普遍推广速成识字法

    普遍推广速成识字法
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会为了普遍推广速成识字法，特给予速成识字法的创造者祁建华同志以奖状。这是我国人民文化教育事业中的一件大事。
    速成识字法是人民解放军西南军区某部文化教员祁建华同志，从一九四九年以来，在部队识字教学中，根据实际经验所创造的迅速扫除文盲的良好方法。它对于我国工农兵群众的文化教育的发展，具有极其重大的意义和作用。
    扫除文盲、普及文化是我国人民文化教育工作的迫切任务。毛主席在“论联合政府”中早已指示我们：“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建立新中国的必要条件。”毛主席在一九五○年八月一日所发布的“中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会关于在军队中实施文化教育的指示”中，更明白地规定：“在职与离职的文化学习和教育，应一律采取速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的教育方针。”中央人民政府政务院也在一九五○年六月一日公布了“关于开展职工业余教育的指示”。近两年来，我国文化教育工作者，在人民政府文化教育政策领导之下，都不断努力于扫除文盲、普及文化的工作，使我国工农兵群众的文化教育得到了很大的发展。但是因汉字较难学习，扫除文盲的工作仍有不少困难。“速成识字法”的创造和实验的效果，无疑地将大大加速扫除文盲的任务的实现，将迅速促进工农兵群众文化教育的发展。这对于我国的工业、农业和国防等建设都将发生重要的作用。
    祁建华同志所以能够创造出“速成识字法”，就是因为他正确地执行了毛主席的指示，贯彻了联系实际和走群众路线的教学方针。在我国工农兵群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性不断提高的情况下，他们学习文化的要求正日益迫切，并且要求愈快愈好。祁建华同志从这一基本情况出发，进而研究了成人文盲的特点，联系他自己学习语文的实际经验，大胆地创造着“速成”的识字教学方法，在党的鼓励和帮助下，经过许多次的实验，终于产生了现在的速成识字法。一年以来，这个识字法在各地的实验中获得了优良的成果。在一般情况下，对一个文盲，采用这种方法去教学，只要一百五十小时左右的时间就能认识一千五百字到二千多字，再有一百小时，就可以读完识字课本四本至六本。能够看懂通俗书刊，能够写简单的信和文章。如山东军区某部机炮连经过三个星期一百五十小时的学习，扫除了全连的文盲；重庆一个纺织工人学习班中的二十四个学员，经过二十二天一百八十四小时的学习，每人平均从认识四百五十四个字增加到二千零二十一个字，并且能写简短的书信，能读通俗的报纸。天津一个棉纺工人学习班经过二十三天的学习，三十一个学员平均从识字五百二十二个增加到二千一百零八个。其他许多地区实验的结果，都证明相差不多。可见“速成识字法”的价值，已被事实所肯定了。
    因此，我们完全有根据地可以确定，在全国各地的冬学、工农速成初等学校、职工业余学校、农民业余学校中，都应该普遍推行速成识字法。
    为了普遍地推行速成识字法，我们还应该首先在全国范围内，利用各种工具（报纸、刊物、电影、唱片、连环画、广播等），通过各种方式，宣传速成识字法的内容、优点和效果，介绍各地典型经验和生动事例，使各地工作干部和广大人民群众都知道速成识字法的重要价值。
    根据各地已有的经验，在组织群众采用速成识字法进行学习的时候，必须进行深入的思想动员，要在群众的政治觉悟、生产积极性和学习文化的迫切要求的基础上，更进一步地提高他们的自觉性和主动性，用实际的事例来说明速成识字法的好处，解除他们对于成人学习文化缺乏信心和其他思想顾虑，坚定他们的学习信心。这种思想动员工作，必须针对学员在学习过程中的实际思想情况经常进行。
    在推广速成识字法的教学同时，必须注意巩固学习的成果。根据各地区的经验，要巩固速成识字的成果，主要依靠在识字以后经常的阅读书报和通俗文艺，因此有关文化教育出版的各部门必须有计划地大量编印适当的通俗读物，出版注有注音字母的字典，以供群众阅读，使他们不仅不会忘掉已经认得的字，而且在经常的阅读中能够不断地提高其识字水平和文化水平。
    速成识字法的创造和推广，对于我国工农业余教育制度，将引起很大的改革，工农初等业余学校的学习年限将会缩短，冬学将成为真正能在一个冬天消除一批文盲的学校，并将更广泛地发展。在教学方法上将引出更多新的经验。这一切都有待于教育工作者继续努力研究。
