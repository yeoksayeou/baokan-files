Cultural Briefs

	▲ The first class of students at the Southwest Nationalities Institute in Chengdu, after nearly a year of study, graduated on April 15th. Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, and President of the Institute, encouraged everyone at the graduation ceremony, saying: Ethnic minority students going to work in various places should respect the organization, connect with the masses, continue to study in their respective work positions, carry out the construction of all ethnic groups in the spirit of the Common Program, and strive to build the motherland—the big family of all ethnic groups. This graduating class included more than 500 students from 25 ethnic minorities, including Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Hui, and Nong. Apart from a small number of students staying at the institute for further study and being assigned to work in Beijing, Chongqing, and other places, most will return to work in ethnic minority areas such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan.
	▲ In order to promote the ideological transformation of teachers, the drama group led by the publicity group of the Thrift and Inspection Committee of Peking University recently staged Simonov's four-act, six-scene drama "Alien Shadow" on campus. Five comrades from the People's Art Theater Drama Troupe assisted in the direction. The plot is as follows: Bacteriology expert Trubnikov spent decades studying how to maximize the infectiousness of bacteria and how to weaken it and produce anti-epidemic serum. However, his concern was his personal "reputation" and "status" in the world. Therefore, he wrote part of the results of his decades of research into a book and gave it to an American spy to take to the United States for publication. This behavior was opposed by those around him. Trubnikov was therefore educated and recognized his mistake. This drama provides a valuable lesson to "experts" and "scholars" who are enthusiastic about "academic pursuits" but indifferent to the fate of the motherland and the people, and to the fate of mankind. It vividly illustrates the correct relationship between politics and academics and can help teachers break away from the influence of British and American imperialism in culture and thought.

    ▲在成都的西南民族学院的第一期学员，经过将近一年的学习，已在四月十五日毕业。西南军政委员会副主席、西南军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员兼该院院长王维舟在全体学员举行毕业典礼的会上，勉励大家说：各民族学员到各地工作，要尊重组织，联系群众，在各个工作岗位上继续学习，依据共同纲领的精神，开展各民族的建设事业，为建设祖国——各民族的大家庭而奋斗。这一期毕业的学员包括藏族、彝族、苗族、回族、侬族等二十五个少数民族的子弟，共五百多人，除少数学员留校深造和分送北京、重庆等地工作外，大部分都将回到云南、贵州、西康、川西、川南等少数民族地区工作。
    ▲为了推动教师的思想改造，北京大学节约检查委员会宣传组所领导的剧艺组最近在校内上演了西蒙诺夫的四幕六场话剧“异邦暗影”。由人民剧院话剧团的五位同志协助导演。剧情是这样的：细菌学专家特鲁布尼柯夫以数十年的工夫，研究了如何把细菌传染性提到最高度，又如何削弱细菌传染性及制造防疫血清。但他所考虑的是他个人在世界上的“名誉”和“地位”，因而将数十年来研究的成果的一部分写成书交给一个美国间谍带到美国去出版，他这种行为遭受到了他周围的人的反对。特鲁布尼柯夫因此受到了教育，认识了错误。这个话剧给了热中“学术”，而对祖国和人民、对人类的命运漠不关心的“专家”和“学者”以可贵的教训。它形象地说明了政治和学术的正确关系，可以帮助教师摆脱英美帝国主义在文化思想上所给的影响。
