    Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company's
    Response to the Investigation of Embezzler Zhang Aimin
    To the Editor: The criticism of Zhang Aimin, director of the Xiaotangshan construction site of our company, made by reader Guo Zhaohui published in the People's Daily on March 6th is completely true in all aspects, except for the fact that he stole and sold 360 bags of cement, which has not yet been verified. Since Zhang Aimin came to the company, he has wasted a lot of people's property, and he himself is a major embezzler. During the anti-corruption movement, he confessed to accepting bribes of over 80 million yuan from private merchants and foremen. After our inventory of the construction site, we found that a lot of materials were missing, and it is clear that there were serious collective embezzlement issues here. We are now conducting a thorough investigation, and we thank Comrade Guo Zhaohui for his criticism.

    北京市建筑工程公司
    对检查贪污犯张爱民的答复
    编辑同志：三月六日人民日报发表的读者郭兆惠对我公司小汤山工地主任张爱民的批评，除了他盗卖三百六十袋洋灰的事实还没有查明外，其他各节完全属实。张爱民自到公司以来，浪费了很多人民财产，他本人是一个大贪污犯。反贪污运动当中，他已坦白出接受私商、把头的贿赂八千多万元。我们清点该工地结果，发觉缺少很多材料，显然这里有严重的集体贪污情事。现在，我们正在作彻底检查，我们感谢郭兆惠同志的批评。
