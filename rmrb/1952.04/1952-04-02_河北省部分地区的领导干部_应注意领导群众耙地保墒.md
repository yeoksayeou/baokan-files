Hebei Province’s Leading Cadres in Some Areas
Should Pay Attention to Leading the Masses in Harrowing Land to Preserve Moisture

Farmers in various parts of Hebei Province are carrying out harrowing to preserve soil moisture. Most of the farmland in the southern part has been harrowed once, and some has been harrowed two, three, or even four or five times. Due to the colder climate in the northern region, as of mid-March, most areas had only harrowed about 50% to 70% of their land.

Leading cadres in some areas of Hebei lack sufficient understanding of the significance of preserving moisture and combating drought, and therefore have not paid attention to leading the masses in harrowing. This is an obstacle to carrying out harrowing and moisture preservation work and should be resolved immediately.

    河北省部分地区的领导干部
    应注意领导群众耙地保墒
    河北省各地农民正在进行耙地保墒工作。南半部地区的大部分耕地已普耙一遍，有的并耙到二遍、三遍，甚至四、五遍。北部地区因气候较冷，截止三月中旬，大部地区只耙了百分之五十到七十左右。
    河北部分地区的领导干部，对于保墒抗旱的意义认识不足，因此没有注意领导群众耙地。这是开展耙地保墒工作的障碍，应该立即加以解决。                          耿振增
