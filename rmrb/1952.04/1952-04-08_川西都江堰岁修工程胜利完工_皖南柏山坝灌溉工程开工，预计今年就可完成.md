    The Dujiangyan annual repair project, which irrigates more than three million mu of farmland in western Sichuan Plain, has been successfully completed since construction began in early December last year. On April 1st, a water release ceremony was held in Guanxian with the participation of more than 8,000 farmers.
    This year's annual repair project of the dam involved digging more than 2.65 million cubic meters of river earth, installing more than 106,000 bamboo cages, and building more than 136,000 cubic meters of stone embankments. The scale of the project is 60% larger than the previous annual repair project and 16 times larger than the annual repair projects during the Kuomintang rule. This year, the dam has also established a water management station to rationally regulate the flow of each river, expanding the irrigation area by more than 33,000 mu this year and ensuring that more than 150,000 mu of farmland that lacked water in the past will receive sufficient irrigation.
    The Baishan Dam irrigation project in southern Anhui has fully commenced. The Baishan mountainous area is located on the west bank of the Qingyi River in Jingxian County, Anhui. The mountainous area north of Jingxian County and the plains of Nanling County are regions rich in rice and wheat. However, this area is high in terrain and lacks water for irrigation. According to statistics, this area has suffered eight droughts in the past fourteen years. In order to alleviate the threat of drought suffered by the local people for many years, the Southern Anhui People's Administrative Office decided to build the Baishan Dam irrigation project near Baishan this spring, diverting water from the Qingyi River to irrigate the vast farmland in an area of approximately 980 square li east of the Zhang River, north of Baishan, south of the Zifu River, and west of the Qingyi River. The planned irrigation canal is 47 kilometers long. This project is expected to be completed this year. Local farmers are now actively constructing under the leadership of the People's Government. Mutual aid groups have been organized in each village to ensure that both spring repairs and spring plowing are not delayed. After the completion of the Baishan Dam irrigation project, 180,000 mu of farmland will directly benefit, and the increased grain production and saved water lifting costs can be converted into 23 million jin of rice. To build this project, the East China Military and Political Committee's Water Conservancy Department provided a water conservancy loan of 17.9 billion yuan.

    川西都江堰岁修工程胜利完工
    皖南柏山坝灌溉工程开工，预计今年就可完成
    灌溉川西平原三百多万亩农田的都江堰岁修工程，自去年十二月初开工后，现已胜利完工，四月一日在灌县举行了八千多农民参加的放水典礼。
    该堰这次岁修工程，共挖河方二百六十五万多公方，安竹笼十万六千余条，砌石堤十三万六千多公方，工程规模比上次岁修工程大百分之六十，比国民党统治时期的岁修工程大十六倍。该堰今年并建立了用水管理站，合理调剂各河流量，使今年该堰扩大了灌溉面积三万三千多亩，并可保证十五万多亩过去缺水的农田，得到充分的灌溉。（新华社）
    皖南柏山坝灌溉工程已全面开工。柏山山区在安徽泾县青弋江西岸，山区以北的泾县山地和南陵县的平原，是盛产稻、麦的地区。但这一带地势高亢，缺水灌田。据统计，在过去十四年中，这一带遭过八次旱灾。皖南人民行署为了解除当地人民长年所遭受的旱灾威胁，决定今春在柏山附近修建柏山坝灌溉工程，引青弋江水灌溉漳河以东、柏山以北、资福河以南和青弋江以西大约九百八十平方华里地区内的广大农田。计划中的灌溉渠长达四十七公里。这个工程预计今年完成。现在当地农民正在人民政府领导下积极施工，各村都组织了互助组，保证春修、春耕两不误。柏山坝灌溉工程修成后，直接受益的农田有十八万亩，每年增产的粮食和节省的戽水费，可折合大米二千三百万斤。为修建这个工程，华东军政委员会水利部贷给了水利贷款一百七十九亿元。（新华社）
