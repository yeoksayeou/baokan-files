    Revolutionary Servicemen's Letters Should Be Carefully Forwarded
    Comrade Editor: I hope that relevant departments in all regions will carefully forward the letters of revolutionary servicemen.

    Comrade Yuan Pinqiao, a revolutionary serviceman from Tongbei Township, Daxing District, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, has been unable to communicate with his family for four or five years due to changes in the names of the district and township in his hometown after he joined the People's Army. Just as Comrade Yuan Pinqiao's family was getting anxious, the Qidong County People's Government received a letter from Comrade Yuan Pinqiao, requesting help in inquiring about his family's address. The County People's Government forwarded the letter to the Huian District Office for handling. The clerk of the Huian District Office, responsibly inquired based on the old district and township names on the letter, eventually finding out the address of Comrade Yuan Pinqiao's family through Daxing District. When Comrade Yuan Pinqiao's parents received his letter, they were so happy they almost jumped for joy. This is a great encouragement to both the revolutionary serviceman and his family, directly strengthening the forces for production and defending the motherland.

    Comrade Xu Jinbiao of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also had not communicated with his family for three years because the name of his hometown township had changed. Recently, the unit gave Comrade Xu Jinbiao's family 300 jin of relief rice, and the relief notice was sent to the local County People's Government. Because the township name was written incorrectly, it was not delivered.
    Once, when Xu Jinbiao's wife, Lu Yalan, went to the County People's Government to inquire, the County People's Government gave her the notice from the unit regarding the relief for Xu Jinbiao's family. After Lu Yalan learned her husband's mailing address in the unit, she happily resumed contact with her husband, Xu Jinbiao.

    Similar situations are frequently discovered in various places. In addition to hoping that comrades in the army will actively and frequently contact their families, we also hope that local People's Governments, relevant cadres, and postal workers will do their best to forward letters to revolutionary servicemen with incorrect addresses, so that revolutionary servicemen and their families can communicate frequently and encourage each other.

    应认真转递革命军人的信件
    编辑同志：我希望各地有关方面认真转递革命军人的信件。
    苏北启东县大兴区同北乡革命军人袁品桥同志，参加人民军队以后，因家乡区乡名称更换，有四、五年和家庭通不了信。袁品桥同志的家属正在着急的时候，启东县人民政府接到了袁品桥同志的来信，这封信要求代问他家属的住址。县人民政府把这封信转交惠安区公所处理。惠安区公所文书负责地根据来信上的旧区乡名称，问到大兴区，才查问出袁品桥同志家属的住址。当袁品桥同志的父母接到袁品桥同志的来信时，都快活得跳了起来。这对革命军人和革命军人家属都是一个很大的鼓舞，直接加强了生产和保卫祖国的力量。
    解放军某部徐锦标同志，也因家乡乡名变更，和家中三年没有通过音信。最近，部队方面给徐锦标同志家中救济粮大米三百斤，把救济通知书寄给当地县人民政府，因乡名写得不对，也没有寄到。有
    一次，徐锦标的妻子陆亚兰到县人民政府询问时，县人民政府就把部队里寄来的关于救济徐锦标家属的通知书交给她。陆亚兰知道丈夫在部队的通讯处以后，就以愉快的心情和丈夫徐锦标恢复了联系。
    各地时常发现类似的情况。我们除了希望部队里的同志主动地经常地和各自家属联系以外，并希望各地人民政府、有关干部和邮递员等，对于地址不符的革命军人信件，尽力设法转递，以使革命军人和革命军人家属能经常通信，彼此鼓励。
