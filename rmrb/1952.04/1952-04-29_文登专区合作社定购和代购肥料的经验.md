The Experience of Wenden Special District Cooperative in Ordering and Purchasing Fertilizers
Shandong Province Wenden Special District Cooperative General Agency

The Wenden Special District Cooperative of Shandong Province has carried out the work of ordering and purchasing fertilizers throughout the district (ordering fertilizers is priced according to the current listed price, farmers pay a deposit in advance, and the cooperative supplies fertilizers regularly; purchasing fertilizers on behalf of farmers involves paying according to the current listed price, with the price temporarily undetermined, and the price will be determined at the time of fertilizer supply at a price no higher than the then-current listed price). Since March 10th, as of April 14th, they have received 6.4 billion yuan in deposits for fertilizer orders and 12.3 billion yuan in payments for fertilizer purchases on behalf of members and general farmers, totaling 18.7 billion yuan. This has not only brought into play the latent economic power of the masses and solved the difficulty of insufficient funds for the cooperative, but also ensured the completion of the task of supplying fertilizer.

Why was the Wenden Special District Cooperative able to achieve such good results? To sum it up, there are four reasons:

I. From the CPC District Committee and the Commissioner's Office to the CPC Village Branches and Village People's Governments, great importance was attached to the work of fertilizer supply. The District Committee Secretary and the Commissioner emphasized at the County Committee Secretary meeting that fertilization is an effective way to increase production, and called on Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels to mobilize the masses to ensure the completion of the fertilizer supply plan. The CPC County Committees and District Committees also seriously arranged the work of supplying fertilizer. The Hengkou United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Kunyu County, with the active support of the CPC Village Branch and the Village People's Government, received payments equivalent to 20,000 jin of peanuts for fertilizer purchases on behalf of farmers in three days.

II. Break down the negative thinking of cadres in the work of fertilizer supply and actively tap the potential economic power of the masses. At the beginning of the fertilizer supply work, many cadres believed that "the masses have prepared almost enough fertilizer" and that "the masses are unable to purchase fertilizer," advocating loans. This thinking hindered the progress of the fertilizer supply work. Later, the leadership criticized this incorrect thinking with concrete information about the actual purchasing power of the masses and the urgent need for fertilizer, and only then was the work pushed forward.

III. Combine the patriotic production increase movement to publicize the importance of fertilizer for increasing production and mobilize members and the general public to order and purchase fertilizers on behalf of farmers. After this movement, the masses' demand for fertilization has generally increased. Then, the cooperative earnestly explained the difficulties of insufficient funds and the inability to fully supply fertilizer, calling on members and the general public to order or entrust the cooperative to purchase fertilizers on their behalf; at the same time, clearly explaining the methods of ordering and purchasing fertilizers on behalf of farmers. At the same time, Party members, Youth League members, labor models, and mutual aid groups took the lead in ordering or entrusting purchases on their behalf, and the work quickly unfolded.

IV. Combine the work of ordering and purchasing fertilizers on behalf of farmers with the promotion of farmers' products. Members and the general public are willing to order and purchase fertilizers on behalf of farmers, but many people lack cash. The cooperative first promoted the sales of farmers' products, which made the work of ordering and purchasing fertilizers on behalf of farmers active. Eighty percent of the deposits came from promoting the sales of peanuts and kenaf grown by farmers.

    文登专区合作社定购和代购肥料的经验
    山东省文登专区合作总社
    山东省文登专区合作社，在全区范围内开展了定购肥料和代购肥料的工作（定购肥料是按现时牌价作价，农民预交定金，合作社定期供肥；代购肥料是按现时牌价交款，暂不作价，供肥时以不高于当时牌价的价格作价）。自三月十日开始，截至四月十四日止，他们已收到社员和一般农民交付定购肥料的定金六十四亿元，代购肥料款一百二十三亿元，共一百八十七亿元。这不仅发挥了群众的潜在经济能力，解决了合作社资金不足的困难，同时保证了供应肥料任务的完成。
    文登专区合作社为什么能做出这样好的成绩呢？总结起来，原因有以下四点：
    一、从中共地委、专署到中共村支部、村人民政府，都极重视肥料供应工作。地委书记和专员，在县委书记会议上，曾强调指出施肥是增产的有效办法，号召各级党组织和人民政府发动群众，保证肥料供应计划的完成。中共各县县委、区委也都认真地布置了供应肥料的工作。昆嵛县横口联村供销合作社在中共村支部和村人民政府的积极支持下，三天中就收到相当于二万斤花生米的代购肥料款。
    二、打破干部在肥料供应工作中的消极思想，积极发挥群众的经济潜在能力。肥料供应工作开始时，不少干部认为“群众肥料准备的差不多了”，“群众无力购买肥料”，主张贷放。这种思想阻碍了肥料供应工作的进行。后来，领导方面以群众的实际购买力和群众对肥料迫切需要的具体情况，批判了这种不正确的思想，才把工作推进了一步。
    三、结合爱国增产运动，宣传肥料对增产的重要性，动员社员和一般群众定购、代购肥料。经过这一次运动，群众施肥的要求普遍提高了。然后，合作社就恳切地说明因为资金不足、不能充分供应肥料的困难，号召社员和一般群众定购或委托合作社代购肥料；同时，明确地讲解定购、代购肥料的办法。同时，党员、团员、劳动模范、互助组积极带头定购或委托代购，工作很快就展开了。
    四、把定购、代购肥料工作和推销农民的产品结合起来。社员和一般农民都愿意定购、代购肥料，但不少人缺乏现钱。合作社先推销了农民的产品，就使定购、代购肥料的工作活跃起来。定款的百分之八十都是推销了农民的花生米和洋麻而得来的。
