    For a Bright Future for Humanity
    ——Commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the Birth of Vinci [Note]
    Jiang Feng
    Editor's Note: Today is the 500th anniversary of the birth of the great Italian artist Vinci. The three commemorative articles published here introduce Vinci's great achievements in art and science respectively.
    April 15th marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of the great artist of the Italian Renaissance - Leonardo da Vinci. Although he left our era and country so long ago, his tremendous contribution to the development of realistic art has made his achievements the common wealth of the people of the world. Art workers in New China are not only very familiar with him, give him high praise and respect, but also consider him one of the Western European classical writers most worthy of our study.
    Vinci spent most of his life connected with Florence. Florence was the most progressive Italian city of the fifteenth century. In this city, the culture of the early bourgeoisie had reached an extremely brilliant level. Non-religious, scientific ways of thinking were widely disseminated, rejecting the stale church philosophy and destroying the foundation of the medieval worldview; on the other hand, the new shackles that bound the development of artists' personalities, which arose with the capitalist commodity society, had not yet formed. Artists of the Renaissance developed and matured under such transitional conditions, possessing very rich creativity. Vinci was the most outstanding and typical figure among them.
    Vinci's thought and wisdom penetrated almost every aspect of human knowledge. He "was not only a great painter, but also a great mathematician, mechanic and engineer; many important inventions in physics are all attributed to him" (Engels - Preface to "Dialectics of Nature"). This all-around genius's creations in the field of art were even richer and more significant. He took the various elements of fifteenth-century painting art: anatomy, perspective, composition, light and shade, and other fragmented technical knowledge, and as a result of long-term research and practice, organized them into scientific laws, and stipulated that these painting elements should be interconnected in the descriptive process and become an inseparable whole. In this way, the descriptive techniques of painting were advanced to a complete stage, thereby greatly improving the realistic ability of painting and the completeness of the picture composition.
    The scientific laws of painting description and the strict spirit of realism are the weapons that Vinci used to make artistic images as mathematically correct. However, the correctness of the image required by Vinci was not to adopt a mechanically imitative attitude towards nature; on the contrary, he repeatedly opposed this descriptive attitude. He said: "The painter only paints with his eyes and technique, without any ideals, just like a mirror, simply reflecting the things placed in front of it without changing them, and does not actually realize the existence of these things." This is a profound criticism of the naturalistic descriptive attitude that only seeks superficial resemblance. In Vinci's works, the emphasis on the correct description of the figures' postures and movements is clearly aimed at expressing the figures' thoughts and personalities through them. Regarding this point, Vinci himself said more specifically: "A figure painting, or other forms of figure representation, should be done in such a way that people can easily perceive their thoughts from their postures... just like a deaf person watching two people talking, even though he cannot hear, he can still infer the topic of their discussion from the actions and gestures of the two people speaking."
    The description of the characters' personalities is the most important and brilliant part of Vinci's artistic creation. Regarding Vinci's pursuit of character description, the biography writes: In the creative process of "The Last Supper", when he painted each person, he first studied whether that person's status was high or low, whether his personality was good or evil, whether he was honest, frivolous, happy or melancholy... then, based on these, he further determined the appearance, attitude, habits, movements, etc., and carried out the work of drafting; in order to create the type of Judas, he spent almost a year, going to places where rogues gathered every morning and evening to look for people with faces similar to Judas. Vinci did not handle the description of characters formulaically and conceptually like many painters of the same era. He used the character's identity (class), experience (life), and age (physiology) as a basis, and then showed their various different personalities through each person's attitude towards specific events. The combination of these two - the general and the specific - is the basic method of Vinci's creation of characters' personalities; it is also the source of the characters' sense of reality and typicality. The most successful application of this method of describing personality is in "The Last Supper".
    Vinci's great achievements in art and science must be attributed to his unremitting spirit of research. The approximately seven thousand pages of manuscripts he left behind on art and science prove how amazing and strict his research work was. But Vinci was not a scholar in a study; his research work was closely linked to practice, which was the key to his success. Vinci, like his contemporaries, was an excellent practitioner, because "they almost all lived for the benefit of their time, and all participated in actual struggles, standing on the side of a certain faction, some fighting with language and pen, others with swords or other weapons" (Engels - Preface to "Dialectics of Nature"). Vinci's life's work proves this fact: he studied science in order to transform nature and seek benefits for mankind; he studied the laws of anatomy, perspective, composition, light and shade, and other artistic elements in order to improve the ability of art to express reality.
    The spirit of starting from reality formed Vinci's consistent opposition to religious dogmatism and the conjecture and arbitrary judgment of natural philosophy in his way of thinking, and put forward a rational and clear way of thinking. This method is based on scientific experiments to understand the objective world. Therefore, Vinci believes that "the disconnection between theory and practice is the most unfortunate thing." He used such an example to illustrate this fact. He said: "Painters after ancient Rome, because they consistently copied each other, their art has also declined from generation to generation... Taking other people's works as samples can only produce paintings of little value." Everyone knows that most of the Italian painters of the fifteenth century were fascinated by the imitation of ancient Greek art, but Vinci alone refused to limit his artistic creation by the imitation of antiquity. Although ancient art was also loved by Vinci, what attracted him was the irresistible real world; "Nature is the mother of all" became his motto and the central idea of his artistic creation, rather than the form of Greek art.
    The great realist artist Vinci, like all the giants of world culture, always worked for the benefit of mankind and the progress of society. Vinci was very concerned about the future of his motherland - Italy, which was in a state of division and unrest. He hoped that Italy could be unified under the rule of a strong national ruler. In his view, Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan at that time, had the potential to become a national leader. So in 1482, Vinci went to Milan with this good hope to contribute all his talents to Ludovico (that is, to Italy). Although Vinci also knew that the work of unifying Italy required the use of force, Vinci was opposed to unjust acts of war. He believed that war was "extremely bestial brutality." The scenes in the war murals he made in the Florence City Hall were described as so barbaric and miserable: "The dead, some half-buried in the soil, others whose blood flowed out and mixed with the dust, turned into deep red mud... showing others gnashing their teeth in the pain of death, rolling their eyes, pounding their bodies with clenched fists, their legs twisted..." From this, we can also understand that Vinci was a humanist who opposed the unjust wars of mankind.
    Vinci was a great humanist, his ideals and work belong to all mankind. When European adventurers were preparing to conquer Mexico in order to plunder the gold of the Americas, Vinci, in his "prophecy" on "precious metals," had already predicted the trend of European bourgeois expansion of colonies, and made a sharp accusation against this sinful act. He said: Gold "will be produced from dark and miserable caves, and will cause huge suffering, danger and death to all mankind... It will lead to countless evils, and it will encourage and encourage despicable people to assassinate, steal, and enslave others." From this accusation against the despicable, shameless, and barbaric behavior of the bourgeoisie, we can more clearly know that Vinci's ideals and work were for a bright future for mankind. In the great struggle to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression that is being carried out today, we should carry forward this spirit. This is why the people of China and the world who love peace want to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of this giant - Vinci.

    为了人类美好的未来
    ——纪念芬奇〔注〕诞生五百周年
    江丰
    编者按：今天是意大利伟大艺术家芬奇诞生的五百周年纪念日。我们在这里发表的三篇纪念文章，分别介绍了芬奇在艺术上、科学上的伟大成就。
    四月十五日是意大利文艺复兴时代的伟大的艺术家——辽奥纳多·达·芬奇诞生五百周年的纪念日。他离开我们的时代和国土虽然如此久远，但由于他对现实主义艺术的发展的巨大的贡献，他的成就已成了世界人民的共同财富，新中国的艺术工作者不仅非常熟悉他，给他以很高的评价和尊崇，并且认为他是我们最值得学习的西欧的古典作家之一。
    芬奇一生的大部分，与佛罗仑斯有着联系。佛罗仑斯是十五世纪最前进的意大利城市。在这城市里，早期资产阶级的文化已达到极其灿烂的程度。那非宗教的、科学的思想方法得到广泛的传播，排斥着陈腐的教会哲学，摧毁了中世纪的人生观的基础；另一方面，随着资本主义商品社会所产生的，那束缚艺术家个性发展的新镣铐尚未形成，文艺复兴时代的艺术家，就在这样的过渡阶段的条件下发展和成熟起来，具有了非常丰富的创造性。芬奇就是其中最杰出、最典型的人物。
    芬奇的思想和智慧，几乎深入到人类知识的各方面。他“不但是伟大的画家，并且是伟大的数学家、机械学家和工程师，物理学上多种多样的重要发明全归功于他”（恩格斯——“自然辩证法”序言）。这个全能的天才，在艺术领域中的创造更是丰富、显著，他把十五世纪绘画艺术的诸要素：解剖、透视、构图、明暗等琐碎的技法知识，经过长期研究和实践的结果，被整理成为科学的法则，并且规定这些绘画要素，在描写过程中互相联系起来，成为不可分割的整体。这样，将绘画的描写技术推进到一个完成的阶段，从而大大地提高了绘画的写实能力和画面构成的完整性。
    绘画描写的科学法则和严格的写实精神，是芬奇使艺术的形象达到数学那样正确的武器，但芬奇所要求的形象的正确，并不是采取机械地模仿自然的态度；正相反，他是一再反对这种描写态度的。他说：“画家只是凭着眼睛和技术作画，而没有任何理想，就好像一面镜子，只是将放在它面前的事物原封不动地照进去，实际上并没有意识到这些事物的存在。”这对只求形似的自然主义的描写态度，是何等深刻的批评。在芬奇的作品中，所以强调人物姿势和运动的正确描写，很明显地，目的是为了通过它们以表现人物的思想和性格。关于这一点，芬奇自己说得更具体：“一张人物画，或其它形式的人物的表现，应该做到使人一看就很容易地从他们的姿势中，觉察他们的思想……就好像一个聋子看两个人讲话，虽说他不能听见，但依然可以从两人说话的动作姿势中，揣度他们讨论的主题。”
    人物的性格描写，是芬奇的艺术创造中最重要、最辉煌的一部分。关于芬奇追求人物性格描写的情况，传记里这样写着：他在“最后的晚餐”的创作过程中，每画一个人的时候，必先研究那个人的地位是高是低，性格是善是恶，是诚实，是轻佻，是快乐还是忧郁……然后根据这些再进一步决定面貌、态度、习惯、动作等而进行打草稿的工作；为了创造犹大的典型，差不多有一年的时间，每天早晚到无赖汉聚集的地方去找类似犹大面貌的人。芬奇不像同时代的许多画家那样，公式地、概念地来处理性格的描写，他是以人物的身份（阶级）、经历（生活）和年龄（生理）作为根据，再通过各个人对具体事件的态度，而显示出他们各种不同的性格，这两者——一般和特殊的结合，就是芬奇创造人物性格的基本方法；这也是人物的真实感和典型性的来源。在“最后的晚餐”中运用这种描写性格的方法最为成功。
    芬奇在艺术上以及科学上的伟大成就，不能不归功于他那努力不渝的研究精神。就从他留下的约有七千页关于艺术和科学方面的手稿，可以证明他的研究工作是何等惊人，何等严格。但芬奇并不是一个书斋的学者，他的研究工作是和实践密切结合着的，这是他成功的关键。芬奇和同时代的人们一样，都是出色的实行家，因为“他们几乎都为自己时代的利益而生活着，都参与实际的斗争，他们站在某一党派方面，有的用语言和笔，有的用剑或其他武器斗争着”（恩格斯——“自然辩证法”序言）。芬奇一生的工作证明了这个事实：他研究科学是为了改造自然，为人类谋福利；他研究解剖、透视、构图、明暗等艺术的法则，是为了提高艺术表现现实的能力。
    从实际出发的精神，形成了芬奇在思想方法上一贯反对宗教的教条主义和自然哲学的臆测妄断，而提出了理性的、明确的思想方法。这方法是以科学的实验作根据，去认识客观世界的，因此，芬奇认为“理论与实际的脱节，是最不幸的事”。他以这样一个例子说明了这个事实，他说：“古代罗马以后的画家，由于他们一贯地彼此抄袭，他们的艺术也就代代地衰微下去了……拿别人的作品做样本，只能制作出价值不高的图画。”大家都知道，十五世纪意大利的画家，大多是醉心于古代希腊艺术的模仿，惟独芬奇拒绝以古代的模仿来限制自己的艺术的创造。古代的艺术虽也为芬奇所喜爱，但吸引他的，则是使他不可拒抗的现实世界；“自然是一切之母”成了他的座右铭，成了他的艺术创作的中心思想，而不是希腊艺术的形式。
    伟大的现实主义的艺术家芬奇，和一切世界文化巨人们一样，始终是为着人类的福利和社会的进步而工作着的。芬奇对于自己的祖国——处在四分五裂不安状态下的意大利的前途，是很关心的，他希望意大利能在一个坚强的国家统治者的手下统一起来。在他看来，当时的米兰大公路多威科是具有成为国家领袖的可能的，于是在一四八二年，芬奇抱着这种善良的希望到米兰去，为路多威科（即为意大利）贡献他的一切才能。虽然芬奇也知道，统一意大利的工作需要使用武力，但芬奇对于非正义的战争行为是反对的，他认为战争是“极端兽性的狂暴”。他在佛罗仑斯市政厅作的战争壁画上的景象，描写得如此野蛮、凄惨：“死亡的人，有的半埋在土中，其他的人流出的血和尘土混在一起，变成深红的泥……表现另外一些人在死亡的痛苦中咬磨着牙齿，翻转着眼睛，用握紧的拳头捣着他们的身体，腿扭曲着……”从这里也可以体会到芬奇是反对人类非正义战争的人道主义者。
    芬奇是一个伟大的人道主义者，他的理想和工作是属于全人类的。当欧洲的冒险家为了掠夺美洲的黄金而正在准备征服墨西哥时，芬奇在论“贵重的金属”的“预言”中，已推测到欧洲资产阶级扩张殖民地的趋势，并且对这种罪恶行为提出了尖锐的控诉。他这样说：黄金“将从黑暗凄惨的洞穴中产出来，会使整个人类遭受巨大的痛苦、危难和丧亡……它将招致无数的罪恶，它将助长并鼓舞卑劣的人们去暗杀、去盗窃、去奴役别人。”从这对资产阶级的卑劣、无耻、野蛮行为的控诉中，使我们更加清楚地知道：芬奇的理想和工作，是为了人类美好的未来的，在今天进行着的保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的伟大斗争中，我们应当发扬这种精神。这就是中国和全世界爱好和平的人们为什么要纪念这一个巨人——芬奇——诞生五百周年的原因。
