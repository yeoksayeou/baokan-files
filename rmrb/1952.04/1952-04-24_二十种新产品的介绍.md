    Over the past three years, the Northeast's machinery and electrical manufacturing industries have produced more than 800 new products. The Northeast Industrial Department inspected 20 of the most significant and representative of these on April 14th and rewarded the units that trial-produced them. These twenty new products are: (1) A complete set of 800 kW hydro-turbine generator equipment. This is the first relatively large-scale hydroelectric power generation equipment successfully manufactured in the Northeast. After electrical performance and over-speed tests, it proved to fully meet quality standards. The successful trial production of this new product by the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau not only solves equipment difficulties in the area of use, but also accumulates experience for the future manufacture of large-scale power generation equipment. Based on this experience, the bureau is now manufacturing 3,000 and 5,000 kW hydro-turbine generators. (2) A 1.5-meter herringbone gear planer. Herringbone gears are important components of mining, metallurgy, and cement machinery. Therefore, the successful manufacture of this new product makes a significant contribution to the recovery and development of mining, metallurgy, and cement enterprises. (3) A 106 mm precision boring machine. Boring machines are relatively precise and complex machines among machine tools and are also machine tools that are currently lacking. This new product precisely addresses the current need. (4) Magnetic separator. The main ironmaking raw material in the Northeast region, lean ore, must undergo a mineral separation process before it can be used for ironmaking. The magnetic separator is a machine that performs this mineral separation work. Without it, lean ore cannot be thoroughly processed. The successful manufacture of the magnetic separator creates conditions for the development of the Northeast's mineral separation industry. (5) Soviet-style 300-meter and 500-meter drilling rigs. These were manufactured by the Jixi General Machinery Factory and meet Soviet standards in quality. The successful manufacture of this new product greatly helps geological exploration work. (6) 560 types of ball bearings and roller bearings successfully manufactured by the Northeast 14th Machine Factory in 1951. Modern machinery manufacturing industry is gradually developing towards high-speed and high-efficiency. Ball bearings and roller bearings are key components of high-speed rotating devices. In the past, our country could only assemble foreign semi-finished products. These 560 types of ball bearings and roller bearings can solve part of the current industrial needs. (7) 13,800 volt high-voltage generator coil. The coil is one of the main components of a motor. Due to the rapid development of industry in the Northeast, the power supply is quite inadequate. Therefore, repairing and restoring existing power generation equipment has become a very important task. After the high-voltage coil was successfully manufactured, it created conditions for the power industry to systematically overhaul all power generation equipment to increase output. It also solved an important problem for the future manufacture of large-scale motors. (8) Ordinary corundum. Corundum is a raw material for important grinding tools in the mechanical industry. In the past, it was all reliant on ordering from abroad. Now, the workers and staff of the Northeast 13th Machine Factory have mastered the corundum extraction technology. The corundum produced meets international standards, solving more than 80% of the raw material supply problem for grinding tools. (9) 1,000-ton oil press. The successful manufacture of this new product solves the main equipment problem for manufacturing electrodes for electric furnace smelting. (10) Steam turbine blades. Turbine blades are the main components of steam turbine machines. Several turbine generators in the Northeast have been in use for a long time, and the blades have been corroded and damaged, resulting in reduced output. The manufacture of turbine blades allows the power industry to repair turbine machines, increase power generation output, and also solves an important problem for the future manufacture of turbine machines. (11) Steam turbine diaphragms. Diaphragms are important components in turbine machines. Its successful manufacture allows blowers to be repaired, increasing air volume, and thus increasing iron output. It also solves an important problem for the future manufacture of turbine machines. (12) Cement kiln tires, hydro-turbine rotors, and paper machine dryer rolls successfully manufactured by the Northeast Second Machine Factory. The large tires of cement kilns solve the repair and replacement problems of cement plants, allowing cement production to be increased. The successful casting of hydro-turbine rotors solves a major problem for the manufacture of large hydroelectric generators. (13) Large gears. These were manufactured by the Benxi Coal and Iron Company Machinery Factory, and they solve the current urgent needs of the mines. In addition, seven new products, including deep-well water pumps, riveting machines, all-gear lathes, overcurrent relays, phenolic plastic bearings for rolling mills, steel-core aluminum wires, and 325 horsepower DC motors, also make important contributions to industrial production.

    二十种新产品的介绍
    三年来东北机械和电器制造工业制造了八百多种新产品，东北工业部在四月十四日检阅了其中有重要意义和具有代表性的二十种，并奖励了试制这些产品的单位。这二十种新产品是：（一）八百瓩水轮发电机全套设备。这是东北制造成功的第一台较大型水力发电设备，经过电气性能及过速试验，证明完全合乎质量标准。东北电器工业管理局试制这一新产品成功后，不但可以解决使用地区的设备困难，且为今后制造大型的发电设备积累了经验。该局现正根据这个经验，制造三千和五千瓩水轮发电机。（二）一点五公尺人字齿轮刨床。人字齿轮是矿山、冶金和水泥机械重要的部件，因此这一新产品的制造成功，对恢复与发展矿山、冶金和水泥等企业有很大贡献。（三）一零六公厘精密摚床。摚床是机床中比较精密和复杂的机器，也是目前所缺少的机床。这一新产品正好解决目前的需要。（四）磁选机。东北地区主要炼铁原料——贫矿石，必须经过选矿过程才能用以炼铁，磁选机就是担任这种选矿工作的一种机械，没有它就不能彻底地处理贫矿石。磁选机的制造成功，为东北选矿工业的发展创造了条件。（五）苏联式三百公尺及五百公尺钻探机。这是鸡西总机厂制造的，质量合乎苏联标准。这一新产品的制造成功，对地质勘察工作有很大帮助。（六）东北第十四机器厂一九五一年制造成功的五百六十种滚珠、滚珠轴承。近代机械制造工业，逐步向高速高效能方向发展，而滚珠、滚珠轴承是高速转动装置的关键性部件。过去我国只能将外国的半成品进行装配。这五百六十种滚珠、滚珠轴承，可以解决目前工业的部分需要。（七）一万三千八百伏特高压发电机线圈。线圈是电机中主要部件之一。东北由于工业的迅速发展，电源颇感不足，因此检修和恢复现有的发电设备成为非常重要的工作。高压线圈制造成功后，就为电业部门创造了有计划地检修所有发电设备以提高出力的条件，同时也为今后制造大型电机解决了一个重要问题。（八）普通金刚砂。金刚砂是机械工业中重要的研磨工具的原料。过去都是依靠向国外定货。现在东北第十三机器厂职工已掌握了金刚砂的提炼技术，制出的金刚砂达到国际标准，解决了百分之八十以上的研磨工具的原料供应问题。（九）千吨油压机。这一新产品的制造成功，使目前制造电炉冶炼用电极的主要设备问题得到解决。（十）蒸汽透平汽叶。汽叶是蒸汽透平机主要的部件。东北若干透平发电机由于使用年限已久，汽叶多已腐蚀损坏，致出力减低。透平汽叶制成后，使电业部门可以检修透平机，提高发电出力，也为今后制造透平机解决了一个重要问题。（十一）蒸汽透平隔板。隔板是透平机中重要的部件。它的制造成功，使鼓风机得以修复，风量提高，因而使出铁量增加，同时也为今后制造透平机解决了一个重要问题。（十二）东北第二机器厂制造成功的水泥窑轮带、水轮机转子和造纸机干燥辊。水泥窑的大轮带，解决了水泥厂的修配问题，使水泥的产量得以提高；水轮机转子的铸造成功，给制造大水力发电机解决了一个主要问题。（十三）大型齿轮。这是本溪煤铁公司机器厂制造的，它解决了目前矿山的急需。此外，深井水泵、铆钉机、全齿车床、过电流继电器、轧钢机胶木轴瓦、钢心铝线以及三百二十五匹马力直流电动机等七种新产品也都对工业生产有重要贡献。（新华社）
