    Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky was born in 1893 in the village of Baghdadi, Georgia. He first studied at the Kutaisi Boys' High School, and later entered the Moscow High School, from which he graduated. In 1908, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks); in March of the same year, he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Butyrskaya Prison for participating in the activities of a secret Bolshevik newspaper; in 1910, he was released due to his young age, but he remained under police surveillance.
    Mayakovsky dedicated his entire life and his brilliant poetic talent to the cause of the liberation of the working people. From the very beginning of his literary career, he showed himself to be an outstanding innovator of poetic form, a pioneer of a new poetic form.
    This young poet, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, stood on the extreme left in literature. His first collection of poems was printed in 1913. In 1918, he appeared on the literary scene as a member of the young Futurists. He sharply attacked the weak poetry of the decadent period.
    However, Mayakovsky, as a Futurist, followed a different path from his other companions. He could not write merely to create a new poetic form, although this form was also used to oppose the "abstract" words of the Symbolists who decorated high society. He was no longer confused by the contentless forms and meaningless sounds of Futurism. His poetry at that time was already known for its depth and sharpness of social content. In his early works, he already expressed his enthusiasm for the struggle against the capitalist system.
    Mayakovsky unreservedly accepted the Great October Revolution, from which he saw the long-awaited liberation of mankind. He wrote in his diary: "...October... to accept or not to accept? Such a question did not exist for me. This is my revolution. I went to Smolny."
    The young Soviet Socialist Republic greatly expanded the poet's horizons. From the very first days of the Soviet state's existence, he stood at the forefront of its defenders. With abundant energy and talent, he used all literary forms, regardless of whether others considered them high or low, to serve the socialist revolution and the construction of a new world. He wrote with great emotion: "I dedicate all the loud strength of my poet to you, the attacking class." He glorified the Great October Socialist Revolution in his passionate, immortal verses, and he became a powerful and enthusiastic singer of the socialist revolution. In many poems, including "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin" and "Alright!" "Sing Out Loud," he used his genius artistic skill to explain the great significance of the October Revolution and also expressed the poet's deepest love for the great revolutionary leader Lenin.
    In 1919, he worked in a department of the Russian Telegraph Agency. There he not only wrote poetry, but also wrote scripts and drew many political satires with poetic captions. He wrote his verses with agitated, carefully chosen words, with a strong Bolshevik party ideology and the emotions of the revolutionary masses. These poems circulated widely among the masses with great agitation, and gave a relentless attack on the enemies of the Soviet Republic. Until his death in 1930, Mayakovsky was a prolific and diligent newspaper contributor, and every event in daily life would evoke a response in his verses.
    In the Soviet regime, in socialist society, the harmony of individual and collective interests became the most prominent theme of his poetry. His lyric poetry never sang the clichés of selfish and isolated people; his poetry was a battle horn, calling on Soviet people to advance bravely towards the ideal communist society of mankind. Every line of his poem, every word, was infused with the noble sentiment of true, active Soviet patriotism. He shouted victoriously and proudly that he was a "citizen of the Soviet Union." He sang loudly: "I sing the praises of my motherland, the spring won by the struggle and labor of mankind, my republic, I sing to you!"
    Mayakovsky visited Western Europe and the Americas many times. He was good at exposing the hypocritical mask of false democracy of American imperialism. When he talked about the essence of capitalist society, he wrote: "People don't imagine saying you are a poet, artist, or philosopher, racking the brains of the audience to guess. Americans immediately and accurately determine: this person is worth $1.23 million. This sentence includes everything: who your friends are, where you are entertained, ... and so on. How your millions of dollars were made is not a matter of concern in the United States." This is the inside story of capitalist culture.
    Mayakovsky resolutely reminded Soviet poets to exert the power of agitation among the working masses. He contemptuously attacked those who hindered socialist construction with sweet roses and nightingale novels. Mayakovsky set a difficult and glorious task for poets: "The leader of the people, and at the same time the servant of the people." Mayakovsky faithfully practiced this sentence throughout his life. His creative life, the role and significance of his poetry, was thoroughly elucidated in the evaluation given by Comrade Stalin: "Mayakovsky was, and still is, the best and most talented poet of our Soviet era."

    关于马雅可夫斯基
    符拉其米尔·符拉其米洛维奇·马雅可夫斯基于一八九三年诞生在乔治亚的巴格达地村。他先在库泰伊西男子中学念书，后来入莫斯科中学，就在这个学校毕业。一九○八年，他加入了俄国社会民主工党（布尔什维克）；同年三月，他因参与一种秘密的布尔什维克报纸的活动而被判徒刑，囚于布图尔斯卡雅监狱；一九一○年，因他年幼而获释放，但他仍旧受警察的监视。
    马雅可夫斯基把他的整个生命和他那光辉的诗歌天才都贡献给劳动人民的解放事业。在他的文学生涯一开始时，他就显出是一个诗歌形式的卓越的革新者，一个新的诗歌形式的开拓者。
    这位充满革命热情的年青的诗人，在文学上是站在极左的一边的。他最初的诗集印行于一九一三年。一九一八年，他以年青的未来派的一员，出现于文坛。他尖锐地攻击颓废时期的柔弱的诗歌。
    可是，作为未来派的马雅可夫斯基，却走着和其他同伴们不同的道路。他不能仅仅为了创造一种新诗形式而写作，虽然这种形式，也是用来反对装饰上流社会的象征主义者的“抽象的”词句的。他不再迷惑于未来主义的那些无内容的形式，无意义的音韵等现象。他的诗歌在当时已经以具有社会内容的深刻性和尖锐性而著名。在他早期的作品中，已表达出他对资本主义制度斗争的热情。
    马雅可夫斯基毫无保留地接受了伟大的十月革命，他从这革命中见到了人类所盼望已久的解放。他在他的日记中这样写道：“……十月……接受呢或是不接受呢？这样的问题对于我是不存在的。这是我的革命。我到斯莫尔尼去了。”
    年青的苏维埃社会主义共和国大大地扩展了诗人的视线。他从苏维埃国家存在的最初的几天起，便站在这个国家的保卫者的最前列。他以充沛的力量，天赋的才智，运用一切不顾他人认为是高级或低级的文学形式，去为社会主义革命和新世界的建设而服务。他十分感动地写道：“我把我全部诗人的嘹亮的力量都贡献给你，进攻的阶级。”他在他热情的、不朽的诗句中歌颂伟大十月社会主义革命，他成为社会主义革命有力而热情的歌手。他在许多诗中，在“符拉其米尔·依里奇·列宁”“好啊！”
    “放开嗓子唱”等诗中，以天才的艺术手腕阐明了十月革命的伟大意义，也表达了诗人对伟大革命领袖列宁的最深厚的热爱。
    一九一九年，他在俄罗斯电讯社的一个部门中工作。在那里他不但写诗，还写剧本，画许多配着诗句说明的政治讽刺画。他以激动的、精选的字眼，带着强烈的布尔什维克党的思想和革命群众的情绪去写他的诗句。这些诗带着很大的鼓动性在群众中流行，对苏维埃共和国的敌人给予了无情的攻击。直到一九三○年他逝世时为止，马雅可夫斯基是一个多产的辛勤的报纸撰稿人，日常生活中的每一事件，都会引起他的诗句的反响。
    在苏维埃政权中，在社会主义社会中，个人和集体利益的谐和成为他的诗歌的最卓越的主题。他的抒情诗从不歌唱那些自私自利的与世隔绝的滥调，他的诗是战斗的号角，它号召苏维埃人为走向人类理想的共产主义社会而勇往直前。他的每一行诗，每个字里，都灌注了真纯的、积极的苏维埃爱国主义的高贵感情。他胜利而满怀自豪地高呼，他是一个
    “苏联的公民”。他高声地唱道：“我歌颂我的祖国，人类的斗争与劳苦换来的春天，我的共和国，我向你歌唱！”
    马雅可夫斯基曾多次访问西欧和美洲各国。他善于揭破美帝国主义的伪善的假民主的面具。他谈到资本主义社会的本质时写道：“人们并不想像地说着你，使听众绞尽脑汁来猜想你是诗人、美术家、哲学家。美国人一下子就准确地确定：这个人值一百二十三万美元。这句话就包括了一切：你的朋友是什么人，你在什么地方受人招待，……等等。你的百万金元用什么方法弄来，在美国是不用管的。”这就是资本主义文化的内幕。
    马雅可夫斯基坚决地提醒苏维埃的诗人们，要在工人群众中发挥鼓动的力量。他轻蔑地攻击那些以甜蜜的玫瑰花和夜莺的小说来妨碍社会主义建设的人们。马雅可夫斯基替诗人定了一种困难而光荣的任务：“人民的领导者，同时又是人民的仆人。”马雅可夫斯基的一生，忠实地实践了这一句话。他的创造性的一生，他的诗的作用和意义，在斯大林同志所给予的估价中，被彻底阐明了：“马雅可夫斯基过去是，并且现在还是我们苏维埃时代最优秀、最有才华的诗人。”
