    China Native Produce Company North China Regional Company
    Holds Native Produce Exchange Symposium
    In order to implement the decisions of the North China Economic Conference on strengthening various economic construction tasks following the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the North China Regional Company of the China Native Produce Company convened a native produce exchange symposium on the 9th. This meeting will last for a week. In addition to representatives from the native produce companies of the five provinces and two cities in North China, the native produce companies of major administrative regions, and purchasing units stationed in Tianjin from other regions, representatives from about 30 industrial and commercial sectors in Tianjin, including relevant state-owned trading companies, private warehouses, tobacco, and dried and fresh fruits, are also participating.
    The central task of this symposium is to organize a large number of transactions to serve industrial and agricultural production: supplying fertilizers, agricultural tools, and daily necessities urgently needed in rural areas; purchasing agricultural and sideline products from rural areas to supply raw materials needed for industrial production. The meeting will also review the implementation of contracts signed by various units during the North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition last year and urge units that have not yet implemented their contracts to do so as soon as possible.
    Transactions at this meeting will adopt convenient methods as much as possible, such as cash transactions, spot transactions with deferred payment, consignment sales, barter, and ordering futures. Participating units can also adopt various other methods that facilitate transactions.
    Starting from the 10th, the symposium was divided into four groups—mountain dried and fresh goods, native industrial raw materials, sugar and miscellaneous goods, and medicinal materials—to hold separate discussions and conduct transactions. On that day, the total value of various native products traded reached over 7.3 billion yuan.
