Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 15th: Our front-line reporter commented on the Korean war situation in the past two months, saying: In the past two months, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, enraged by the heinous crimes of the US aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare, have fought bravely against the enemy on the defensive line, annihilating a total of more than 12,500 enemies.

In a desperate predicament, the US aggressors defied the world by launching bacteriological warfare on January 28, attempting to use this weapon of mass human slaughter to achieve their aggressive goals that could not be achieved militarily. For more than two months, in addition to continuing to spread various insects carrying germs, the US bacteriological war criminals have also been constantly dropping rats, pork, rotten fish, leaves, etc. carrying germs by plane, attempting to spread the plague in this way. They also constantly sent spies to inquire about the epidemic prevention situation of our military and civilians, and collect information on the effectiveness of their bacteriological warfare. However, the facts were not as the US bacteriological war criminals expected. The heroic Korean people and the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have formed an anti-US imperialist bacteriological warfare epidemic prevention army. The strong Korean and Chinese People's warriors have achieved the first round of victory on the anti-bacteriological warfare line. The poisonous insects and poisonous substances spread by the US aerial plague demons have been extinguished, and the epidemic has been effectively controlled. The determination of the Korean and Chinese people and the people's army to defend peace and stop the war of aggression has become more firm and enhanced.

After the US aggressor troops launched a large-scale bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and the Korean people, they strengthened their ground-based raiding activities. The enemy's raiding activities used forces ranging from one squad to one battalion, totaling more than 150 times. Our army, guarding the strong positions, not only quickly and fiercely repelled every raid by the enemy, but also frequently used flexible tactics such as ambushes, night attacks, and counterattacks to cleverly kill and injure the enemy. In particular, the small-scale counterattacks initiated by our army actively and proactively could annihilate the enemy's living forces by squad or platoon each time. In March alone, our army annihilated more than 15 enemy squads in several counterattacks on the western front. Some counterattacks were initiated at the request of the soldiers. Before each counterattack, the soldiers' letters of request flew to the headquarters like snowflakes. The Eighth Company, which was awarded the honorary title of "Steel Company for Defending Kaesong," wrote in their letter of request: "We are the defenders of human civilization and must not allow the beasts to arbitrarily use inhumane bacteriological weapons. We request to severely punish the heinous enemy!" One platoon of the company, in coordination with fraternal units, launched a counterattack on two unnamed highlands northwest of Gorangpo-ri on March 18, annihilating most of the strengthened company of the 12th Regiment of the Lee Syngman puppet army in 15 minutes, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 156 enemy soldiers. The Korean and Chinese People's artillery units engaged in fierce artillery battles with the enemy on the defensive line, and frequently used sudden and accurate shells to kill and injure the enemy, ranging from 30 to 200 people every day. Our army's increasingly powerful artillery fire has caused significant casualties and fear among the enemy. Although Van Fleet still muttered that "the Communist artillery is not a serious threat to the Eighth Army," the words "suffered fierce bombardment from the Communist artillery" have become more and more common in the US news reports. This nakedly revealed that the enemy's so-called "artillery superiority" has been lost. The air defense units of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies also severely punished the US Air Force plague demons with heavier blows. According to incomplete statistics, in February and March, our army shot down and damaged a total of 642 enemy aircraft.

The current situation of the Korean War shows that as long as US imperialism persists in its war of aggression in Korea for one day, it will inevitably consume more of its manpower and material resources for one day. Now, whether it is a large-scale offensive or a small-scale raid, whether in the air or on the ground, the US aggressors have been and will continue to suffer serious losses. The US aggressor troops can never change their increasingly deep predicament on the Korean battlefield.

According to enemy documents captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the front lines and the confessions of prisoners, it is proved that in addition to continuing to conduct bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield, the US aggressors are also conspiring to use chemical weapons and atomic weapons. Recently, the US aggressor troops have been constantly firing poison gas shells and dropping poison gas bombs at us on the front lines. According to incomplete statistics, from February to April 10, the enemy has released various poison gas shells 32 times, and the areas used have spread across the entire line from east to west. According to prisoners' confessions, the US and Lee armies have conducted measures and education among their soldiers on epidemic prevention, protection against poison gas, and protection against atomic weapons. The reactionary US newspapers also revealed that the US "Joint Chiefs of Staff are seriously considering the desirability of using atomic bombs in Korea." The US imperialists' bloody conspiracy to prepare to use chemical weapons and atomic weapons has become clear. If US imperialism dares to act recklessly in this way, it will surely arouse the greatest anger of the Korean and Chinese people and their armies, and even all mankind, and it will surely be severely punished. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers firmly believe that the just struggle will eventually be victorious. All commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers firmly remember the words spoken by Commander Peng Dehuai recently: "We can say with certainty that the bacteriological warfare of the US aggressors will surely suffer a shameful and miserable defeat. Any malicious tricks of the US aggressor troops cannot change the established ending of their final defeat."

The comprehensive results for February and March of this year are as follows:

	One, a total of 12,593 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 6,711 US aggressor troops, 758 troops from various accomplice countries, and 5,124 Lee Syngman puppet troops.
	Two, major captures: 9 various artillery pieces, 64 light and heavy machine guns, 431 various guns, 5 radios, 41 walkie-talkies, 1,600 artillery shells, and 284,218 bullets.
	Three, 62 enemy tanks, 45 vehicles, and 32 various artillery pieces were destroyed; 46 tanks were damaged.
	Four, 192 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 450 enemy aircraft were damaged.
Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 15th: In the first ten days of April, the US aggressor troops continuously launched about 20 raids on our army's forward positions with forces of company and platoon size. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, standing firmly on the solid defense line, repelled every invasion by the enemy.

	One morning, more than 200 enemy soldiers pounced on a certain highland 7 kilometers southeast of Kimhwa. More than ten consecutive charges were bravely repelled by our army, and more than 80 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. At 5:00 a.m. on the 3rd, an enemy company attacked an unnamed highland east of the Bukhan River and was repelled by our fierce firepower, killing or wounding more than 40 enemy soldiers.

	At 0:30 on the 9th, an enemy platoon launched a raid on our army's position in Panlongdong, northeast of Panmunjom, and was immediately repelled by our warriors guarding the neutral zone.

While firmly striking at the invading enemy, a certain unit of our army once counterattacked the enemy's position north of the Imjin River estuary on the 1st. After our army's fierce artillery fire destroyed the enemy's defensive works, the heroic infantry bravely rushed to the top of the mountain, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 80 Lee Syngman puppet soldiers entrenched there. On the 5th, a night raid team of our army suddenly stormed the enemy's position half a kilometer south of Jwaseo-dong, southeast of Kimhwa. After 30 minutes of fierce fighting, most of a platoon of the defending enemy was annihilated, killing or wounding more than 20 people. On the evening of the 8th, a small reconnaissance team of our army suddenly appeared on an unnamed highland 6 kilometers west of Gata-ri on the eastern front, completely annihilating a platoon of the 5th Company of the 35th Regiment of the 25th US Division that was hiding in the fortifications.

    美国侵略军绝不能改变其最后失败的定局
    朝中部队两月歼敌万二千
    击毁击伤敌军飞机六百四十二架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本社前线记者评述两个月来朝鲜战局说：两个月来，被美国侵略者进行细菌战的万恶罪行所激怒的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军，在阻击战线上奋勇打击敌人，共计歼灭敌人一万二千五百多名。
    在绝望的窘境下，美国侵略者竟冒天下的大不韪，在一月二十八日开始发动了细菌战，企图用这种大规模屠杀人类的武器，来取得其军事上不可能达到的侵略目的。两个多月来，美国细菌战犯除了继续撒布带有病菌的各种昆虫以外，还不断用飞机投掷带有病菌的老鼠、猪肉、臭鱼、树叶等等，企图用这些办法来传染瘟疫。它并不断派遣特务来刺探我军民防疫情况，搜集其进行细菌战的效果的情报。然而，事实却不像美国细菌战犯所预期的那样。英勇的朝鲜人民和朝中人民军队已组成一支反对美帝国主义细菌战的防疫大军，身强力壮的朝中人民战士已在反细菌战线上取得了第一回合的胜利，美国空中瘟魔撒下的毒虫毒物已被扑灭，疫病已得到有效的控制。朝中人民和人民军队保卫和平制止侵略战争的决心，已更加坚定和增强。
    美国侵略军在向朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民发动了大规模的细菌战以后，随着就加强了地面上的窜犯活动。敌人的这些窜犯活动使用的兵力从一个班到一个营不等，总计达一百五十多次。守卫在坚固阵地上的我军除迅速猛烈地击退了敌军的每次窜犯外，并经常以伏击、夜袭和反击等灵活的战术，机智地杀伤敌人。尤其是我军积极主动发起的小型反击战，每次都能成班成排地歼灭敌军的有生力量。仅三月份中，我军在西部战线的几次反击中，即歼灭敌军十五个班以上。有些反击战是在战士们的请求下发起的。在每次反击战前，战士们的请战书即像雪片似地飞向指挥部。荣膺“保卫开城的钢铁连队”光荣称号的第八连，在他们的请战书上写着：“我们是人类文明的保卫者，决不能容许野兽们任意使用惨无人道的细菌武器。我们请求狠狠地惩罚万恶的敌人！”该连的一个排，配合兄弟部队在三月十八日向高浪浦里西北两个无名高地反击，在十五分钟内即将李伪军第一师十二联队的一个加强连大部歼灭，共毙伤俘敌军一百五十六名。朝中人民炮兵部队在阻击战线上和敌军进行猛烈的炮战，并经常以突发的准确的炮弹杀伤敌军，每天在三十人到二百个人不等。我军日益强大的炮火在敌军中造成了重大的伤亡和恐惧。尽管范佛里特还要嗫嚅着“共军大炮对第八军并不是严重的威胁”，但美方新闻报道中“遭受共方大炮的猛烈轰击”等字样已经越来越多了。这赤裸裸地道出了敌军所谓“炮火优势”已告丧失。朝中人民军队的防空部队也以更沉重的打击痛惩美国空军瘟魔，据不完全统计，在二、三两月中，我军共击落和击伤了敌军飞机六百四十二架。
    朝鲜战争的现状，显示出只要美帝国主义在朝鲜坚持侵略战争一天，它必然会多消耗一天的人力和物力。现在无论是大进攻或小窜犯，无论在空中或在地面，美国侵略者已经和将继续不断遭到严重的损耗。美国侵略军决无法改变自己在朝鲜战场上越陷越深的窘境。
    据中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在前线缴获敌军的文件和所得俘虏的口供，都证明美国侵略者除将继续在朝鲜战场进行细菌战外，并阴谋使用化学武器和原子武器。最近美国侵略军即在前线不断向我发射毒气炮弹和投掷毒气炸弹。据不完全统计，自二月到四月十日，敌施放各种毒气弹已达三十二次，使用的地区自东至西遍及全线。据俘虏供称：美李军已在其士兵中进行了关于防疫、防毒气、防原子武器的措施和教育。美国反动报刊也透露美国“联合参谋部正在认真考虑在朝鲜使用原子弹的可取之处”。美帝国主义准备使用化学武器和原子武器的血腥阴谋，已经昭然若揭。如果美帝国主义敢于这样胡作妄为，它必将激起朝中人民及其军队以至全人类的最大愤怒，它也必将受到最严厉的惩罚。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决相信，正义的斗争最后必将得到胜利。中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员牢记着彭德怀司令员在最近讲的一段话：“我们可以肯定地说，美国侵略者的细菌战一定要遭到可耻的惨败。美国侵略军任何恶毒伎俩，丝毫不能改变其最后失败的既定结局。”
    本年二、三两月份的综合战果如下：
    一、共歼灭敌军一万二千五百九十三名，包括美国侵略军六千七百十一名，各帮凶国军七百五十八名，李承晚伪军五千一百二十四名。
    二、主要缴获：各种炮九门、轻机枪和重机枪六十四挺、各种枪支四百三十一枝、电台五部、步行机四十一部、炮弹一千六百发、子弹二十八万四千二百十八发。
    三、击毁敌军战车六十二辆、汽车四十五辆、各种炮三十二门、击伤战车四十六辆。
    四、击落敌军飞机一百九十二架，击伤敌军飞机四百五十架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】美国侵略军在四月份头十天内，连续以成连成排的兵力，向我军前沿阵地进行了二十次左右的窜犯。屹立在坚固防线上的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，击退了敌人的每一次进犯。
    一日晨，敌军二百多名猛扑我军金城东南七公里的某高地，连续十多次冲锋都被我军奋勇击退，敌军被杀伤八十多名。三日晨五时，敌军一个连向北汉江以东某无名高地进攻，被我猛烈火力击退，杀伤敌军四十多名。
    九日零时三十分，敌军一个排向板门店东北盘龙洞我军阵地进行窜犯，当即被我保卫中立区的勇士们击退。
    与坚强打击进犯敌军的同时，我军某部一日曾反击临津江口以北敌军阵地。我军猛烈炮火将敌军防御工事摧毁后，英勇的步兵即勇猛冲上山头，毙伤俘盘踞在该处的李伪军八十多名。五日，我军一支夜袭队突然杀上了金城东南座首洞以南半公里处的敌军阵地，激战三十分钟，守敌一个排大部被歼，计毙伤二十多名。八日晚，我军一支小侦察队突然出现在东线加田里西六公里的一个无名高地，将蛰居在工事里的美军第二十五师三十五团第五连的一个排全部歼灭。
