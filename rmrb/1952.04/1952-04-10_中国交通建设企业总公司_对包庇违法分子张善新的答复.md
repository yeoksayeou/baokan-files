Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    We thank readers for their help regarding Qiu Sen's letter, published in the People's Daily on March 1st, which criticized our company for shielding the illegal element Zhang Shanxin.

    Engineer Zhang Shanxin served as a consultant for our company in January of last year. Prior to this, he was responsible for the design, material inspection, and supervision of the project at the New China Institute of Jurisprudence. He made many mistakes in these areas of work. In February, our company sent him to work at our company's Northwest Region Company. In mid-July, our company received a notification from the Northwest Region Company stating that the Beijing Construction Bureau had given Zhang Shanxin a ten-day deadline to return to Beijing to complete the final accounting procedures for the Institute of Jurisprudence project. Because the Northwest Region Company could not spare him from his work, they requested that we handle it on their behalf. Our company immediately dispatched personnel to the Construction Bureau and the New China Institute of Jurisprudence to negotiate, explain Zhang Shanxin's relationship with the company, and decided that the matter should be handled under the auspices of the Construction Bureau.

    When Zhang joined our company, we did not pay attention to investigating the projects he handled in Beijing. This was our negligence. When we sent personnel to the Construction Bureau to negotiate, we also failed to ascertain the truth and did not recognize the seriousness of the facts, which led to a paralyzing oversight. Zhang returned in January, and we did not notify him to go to the Construction Bureau until around February 10th. At the same time, we did not provide Zhang with timely education to resolve this issue promptly. This should be reviewed. Our company is now urging him to reflect and asking him to immediately go to the Construction Bureau to finalize the matters he handled.

                                    China National Transportation Construction Corporation

### 中国交通建设企业总公司  对包庇违法分子张善新的答复

    中国交通建设企业总公司
    对包庇违法分子张善新的答复
    编辑同志：三月一日人民日报刊载邱森同志的来信，批评我公司包庇违法分子张善新，我们感谢读者的帮助。
    张善新工程师去年一月担任我公司顾问，在这以前，他曾对新中国法学研究院的工程负责设计、验料、监工。在这些工作方面，他是有很多错误的。二月，我公司派他到我公司西北区公司工作。七月中旬，我公司接到西北区公司通知，说北京市建设局限张善新在十天内返京办理法学研究院工程的结账手续，因西北区公司工作离不开，要我们代为料理。我公司即派员往建设局、新中国法学研究院接洽，说明张善新和公司的关系，并决定此事由建设局主持办理。
    张参加我公司工作时，我们没有注意调查他在北京经办的工程，这是我们的疏忽大意。我们派员到建设局接洽时，也未查明真相，没有认识事实的严重性，以致麻痹地忽略过去。张是在一月回来的，而我们到二月十日左右才通知他去建设局。同时对张没有作及时的教育，以早日解决这个问题。这是应该检讨的。现我公司正促其反省，要他立即到建设局结束经办的事。
