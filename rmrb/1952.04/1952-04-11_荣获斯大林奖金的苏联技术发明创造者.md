    Soviet Technical Inventors Awarded Stalin Prizes

    Inventors of Automatic Locomotive Signal Devices
    A group of scientists from the All-Union Railway Scientific Research Institute and a group of railway workers were awarded the 1951 Stalin Prize for inventing an automatic locomotive signal device equipped with a continuously operating automatic braking system. This automatic locomotive signal device can transmit signals from the roadside to the locomotive driver's cab. Until recently, locomotive drivers often found it difficult to discern roadside signals in dense fog, heavy snow, or other adverse weather conditions. Now, with this special device installed on the locomotive, signals can be transmitted electrically from the rails to the locomotive and recorded on a small signal machine in the driver's cab. In addition, an automatic braking system is used, which automatically applies the brakes when the train approaches a red light on a roadside signal, without the driver having to intervene. This signaling device increases the safety of train operation and improves the working conditions of locomotive drivers.
    Currently, this new type of signaling device has been widely installed on railway sections in the Ural, Transcaucasian, and other mountainous regions of the Soviet Union.

    Inventors of Beet Combine Harvester
    柯伦科夫 (Kelunke夫), 叶列密耶夫 (Yelemiliyef), and 迈尔尼科夫 (Mairinik夫) invented the three-row "CKEM-3" beet combine harvester. Using this combine, beetroots can be dug out of the soil, the tops cut off, the soil adhering to the roots and tops removed, and the roots and tops placed in separate piles. Its daily productivity is 2.5 hectares, and its productivity per harvest season is 50 hectares. This combine harvests three rows of beets simultaneously. Last year, hundreds of these combines worked in the Ukrainian Republic and the states of Voronezh, Kursk, Tambov, etc. They harvested more than 10,000 hectares of beets. Advanced operators of many machine tractor stations have achieved high productivity using this new combine. For example, Руденко (Rudenko), a combine operator from the Kiev state, harvested 102 hectares of beets in one harvest season, achieving a daily productivity of 5 hectares. They also plan to adapt this combine for harvesting dandelions, fodder, and carrots.

    Engineers Participating in the Volga-Don Canal Construction
    In the construction of the new Volga-Don Canal waterway, engineers have made many inventions and improvements, ensuring the excellent quality of the project and the rapid progress of work, which is incomparable to foreign projects.

    A group of engineers under the guidance of 谢鲁辛 (Xieluxin) received the Stalin Prize. When they built the Цимлянская (Tsimlyanskaya) hydroelectric power station, a major structure of the Volga-Don Canal, they made the construction of the earthen dam very rapid. The powerful suction dredger was used in the construction of this thirteen-kilometer-long dam across the Don River. In the past year alone, this dam completed 24 million cubic meters of earthwork.

    Among the engineers who won the Stalin Prize, some were awarded for inventing perfect methods to overcome groundwater in the Volga-Don Canal project. This method has yielded excellent results. Builders have used this method to protect the foundations of the Tsimlyanskaya Hydropower Station and spillway, covering an area of 50 hectares, from groundwater erosion. Various pumping equipment extracted 10 million cubic meters of groundwater per month from the construction site.

    A group of workers led by Шакишанц (Shakishants) also won the Stalin Prize for their outstanding achievements in organizing quarrying and crushed stone factories. In these factories, all the laborious work from quarrying, transporting, crushing, and sorting stones to the production of pure crushed stone required for hydro-engineering reinforced concrete projects and loading products onto trucks is mechanized.

    Dredge Operator
    Dredge operator Ялыгин (Yaligin) is one of the most advanced construction workers in the Soviet Siberian Altai Territory construction site. He was awarded the prestigious Stalin Prize for continuously improving the use of machinery, perfecting technology, and striving to improve labor productivity. Ялыгин (Yaligin) and his comrades have completed a large amount of work using the same machine for twenty-one years. This innovator has turned his dredge into a versatile machine. It digs deep and wide pits, channels, and ditches, and digs soil from under the water of swamps. This dredge is also used for the assembly of various parts. Ялыгин's dredge is highly efficient in both winter and summer. In winter, he uses a wedge for preliminary loosening of the soil. A two-ton wedge is suspended on the dredge's cable instead of a bucket. When this wedge falls from a height of eight to twelve meters, it crushes a large piece of frozen soil. This work requires specialized skills to aim the wedge in the correct direction.

    After receiving the Stalin Prize, Ялыгин (Yaligin) stated: "My dredge will be used for many more years because we Soviet workers know how to take good care of our machines."

### 荣获斯大林奖金的苏联技术发明创造者

    荣获斯大林奖金的苏联技术发明创造者
    自动机车信号装置的发明者
    全苏铁道科学研究所的一批科学工作者和一批铁路工人，由于发明了一种配有连续操作自动制车器的自动机车信号装置，获得了一九五一年的斯大林奖金。这种自动机车信号装置，可以把路旁的信号传达到机车司机室。直到最近为止，机车司机在浓雾、大雪或其他恶劣气候中往往难于辨别路旁的信号。现在，机车上装上了这种特殊装置，信号就可以凭借电力从铁轨上传送到机车里，并且纪录在司机室的一个小小的信号机上。此外，还采用了一种自动制车器，在列车驶近路旁信号器的红灯时，无需司机动手，它就可以自动使制动器煞车。这种发信号的装置增加了列车行驶的安全，并且改善了机车司机的工作条件。
    现在，苏联乌拉尔、外高加索和其他多山地区的铁路线段都已广泛地配备了这种新式信号装置。
    甜菜联合收割机发明者
    柯伦科夫、叶列密耶夫和迈尔尼科夫三人发明了三排“斯凯姆—三”式的甜菜联合机。使用这种联合机，可以把甜菜根从土中掘出，把梢子切断，把贴在根和梢子上的泥土清除，把根和梢子分别放在不同的两堆上。它每天的生产率是两点五公顷，每收获季的生产率是五十公顷。这种联合机同时收割三排甜菜。去年有数百架这种联合机在乌克兰共和国和佛罗内兹、库尔斯克、坦波夫等各州工作。它们收割了一万多公顷的甜菜。许多机器拖拉机站的先进操使者已经用这种新式联合机获得了高度生产率。例如，基辅州的联合机操使者鲁登科在一个收获季中收割了一百零二公顷的甜菜，使每天的生产率到达五公顷。他们并打算使这种联合机适于收割蒲公英、饲料和胡萝卜等。
    参加伏尔加河——顿河运河建设的工程师
    在伏尔加河—顿河运河新水道的建设工程中，工程师们有了许多发明和改良，保证了工程的优等质量和工作的迅速进行，是外国工程所不能比拟的。
    获得斯大林奖金的有谢鲁辛指导下的一群工程师。他们建设伏尔加河—顿河运河的一个主要建筑齐姆良水力发电站时，使土堤的建筑非常迅速。在建筑这条十三公里长的横跨顿河的大堤时，使用了马力强大的吸泥机。单是去年一年里，这条堤就完成了二千四百万土方的工程。
    获得斯大林奖金的工程师当中，有一些是因为在伏尔加河—顿河运河工程中发明了战胜地下水的完善方法而得奖的。这方法已经收到了优良的成效。建设者们利用这方法，已经保护住占地五十公顷的齐姆良水电站和泄水道的地基，使不致受地下水的侵蚀。各种抽水设备每月从建筑场地抽出了一千万立方公尺的地下水。
    沙基尚茨领导下的一组工人因为组织采石和碎石工场成绩卓著，也获得斯大林奖金。在这些工场里，自采石、运输、碎石和选石，以至水力工程钢筋混凝土工程所需的纯碎石的生产和产品装车，这一切费力的工作全都机械化了。
    挖泥机操使者
    挖泥机操使者雅利金是苏联西伯利亚阿尔泰边疆区工地的最先进的建筑工人之一，由于他不断改进机器的使用，使技术臻于完善，并努力提高了劳动生产率，因而荣获了崇高的斯大林奖金。雅利金和他的同志们二十一年来使用同一部机器完成了大量的工作。这位革新家已经使他的挖泥机成为万能的机器。它挖掘深广的坑、渠和沟，并从沼泽的水下面挖掘泥土。这部挖泥机也被用来从事装置各部分的装配工作。雅利金的挖泥机在冬天和夏天都是效率非常高的。在冬天，他用一个尖劈作初步的松土工作。一个有两吨重的尖劈悬在挖泥机的缆绳上代替一只戽斗。这个尖劈从八公尺到十二公尺的高处降下时，它就捣碎了一大块冻结的土壤。这一项工作需要使尖劈对准正确方向的专门技术。
    雅利金在获得斯大林奖金后，曾表示：“我的挖泥机还要使用许多年，因为我们苏联工人知道怎样好好地照料我们的机器。”
