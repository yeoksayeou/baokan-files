In the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, workers and shop assistants in private industries in Zhangjiakou City have been forged into a conscious and well-organized powerful force.

Zhangjiakou City, like other small and medium-sized cities, has a majority of privately owned small factories and shops. The city has more than 7,100 workers and shop assistants. Factories and shops employing five or fewer workers and shop assistants account for 82.3% of the city's industrial and commercial establishments. Illegal capitalists took advantage of the workers' dispersion and the weakness that a single factory or shop could not independently form a trade union organization, arbitrarily oppressing workers and sabotaging trade union organizations by various means of coercion and inducement. Sun Yin Fan, a large fur merchant, sent his cronies to steal the position of chairman of the fur industry union; the hardware and electrical materials industry union was also infiltrated by Xu Jiannong, manager of Xinhua Electrical Materials Store, and Wang Jun, shareholder of Wuzhou Electrical Materials Store. Some unscrupulous merchants pulled accountants and veteran shop assistants "into shares" in order to prevent them from joining the union. More than 70% of the 61 accountants and veteran shop assistants in the fur industry were pulled "into shares." Many illegal capitalists even restricted workers and shop assistants from joining the union by not registering their household registrations and forcing them to fill out "temporary worker volunteer forms." Serious feudal rule still existed in handicrafts such as construction, woodwork, coarse leather, ironwork repair and manufacturing, and foundries. In these industries, half of the workers and apprentices had not attended a meeting or participated in any political activities since liberation. Many workers and apprentices even wrote "contracts of indenture" to capitalists stating, "I will not participate in any political activities, and the employer has the right to dismiss me at will." The phenomenon of factory owners arbitrarily beating and abusing workers and apprentices was very serious. An Fu Shan, a worker apprentice at Kui Shun Chang Woodworking Factory, was beaten more than 340 times in a year. At the same time, due to the small number and dispersion of employees, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions had long neglected the leadership of the workers' movement in private industries. Over the past three years, more than 2,000 shop assistants had not been discovered. Therefore, before this "Five-Anti" movement, the foundation of the workers' movement in private industries in Zhangjiakou City was very weak. Only 60% of the workers and shop assistants were organized, and many industries had not established trade union organizations at all in the past three years. Those that had been established were mostly formalistic. After the start of the "Five-Anti" movement, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other leading organs drew a large number of cadres from various departments to form several work groups to go deep into various industries to universally mobilize workers and shop assistants. Each group first exposed the ugly essence of the bourgeoisie by using specific illegal acts of illegal capitalists in the city, called on the vast number of shop assistants to draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie, and discovered and cultivated activists to form "tiger-beating" teams and shock groups. In the battle, the achievements of the battle inspired the morale of the workers and shop assistants. During the gaps in the battle, universal class education and future education were carried out for all workers and shop assistants in the city. The consciousness of workers and shop assistants gradually increased. Ma Yin Lin, the accounting director of Yong Xing Long Grocery Store, burned twelve false accounts for the capitalists at the beginning of the "Five-Anti" movement. At that time, he thought, "I haven't been at the counter for long, and the manager promoted me to accounting director and also gave me shares. It's really an unforgettable kindness!" After repeated patient education by the trade union cadres and helping him to calculate carefully, he realized the insidious and vicious nature of the capitalists. Therefore, he bravely reported the crime of the illegal capitalists using him to create false accounts and evade taxes of more than 700 million yuan in the past three years. In those industries where cruel feudal rule still exists, the work group led the vast number of workers and shop assistants to combine the elimination of illegal manufacturers' "five poisons" with speaking out about their suffering. Industries such as woodwork, foundries, and construction all held industry-wide conferences, burned "contracts of indenture" on the spot, and carried out accusation struggles against those illegal manufacturers who cruelly beat and abused workers and apprentices. Hu Shang Bao, a 60-year-old worker who had been enslaved by Ji Xing Kui Noodle Shop for more than 30 years, had not participated in any political activities since liberation. This time, he also reported the illegal acts of the capitalists at the noodle industry workers' conference and told about how he had been deceived and manipulated by the capitalists. Wang Ji Gong, an accountant at Yu Cheng Tai Silk and Cloth Store, was won over by the manager of the store after liberation. He used more than one million yuan, which he had earned from his labor for many years, to buy shares. Not only had he not received a single dividend in the past three years, but he had also created many false accounts for the illegal capitalists. During this movement, the manager of the store still tried to win him over. After participating in the study, Wang Ji Gong resolutely said to the manager of the store, "You have used us to do evil and get rich in the past three years. I will never take the blame for you again!" He immediately reported the crimes of the illegal capitalists to the inspection team.

After the rapid increase in class consciousness, the vast number of shop assistants actively participated in the "tiger-beating" teams and threw themselves into the "Five-Anti" battle. The momentum was stronger than any previous movement. In the half-month from mid-January to early February, more than 2,000 workers and shop assistants organized more than 200 "tiger-beating" teams. Among the more than 1,000 accountants and runners in the city, more than 750 participated in the "tiger-beating" battle. The "tiger-beating" team, originally formed by 14 members of the first branch of the Youth League shop assistants, grew into a fighting contingent with more than 100 young shop assistants, accountants, and runners in less than a month. In the past two months, they have exposed more than 950 illegal facts of illegal manufacturers, and these unscrupulous merchants have stolen more than 4.48 billion yuan of state assets.

The Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions led workers and shop assistants to continuously develop and rectify trade union organizations during the movement. As of now, 50 grassroots trade unions have been established in the city, and 6,130 workers and shop assistants have been organized, accounting for 85.4% of the total number. In response to the shortcomings in organizational work in the past, they have separately established many grassroots trade unions of different natures that were previously mixed, and established organizers in factories and stores with fewer than 25 workers and shop assistants to strengthen the grassroots organizational activities of the trade unions.

At present, the city is planning to continue to lead the vast number of shop assistants and capitalists to sign collective contracts and adjust labor-capital relations as the "Five-Anti" movement deepens, so as to further consolidate the existing achievements. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 张家口市工人店员在“五反”运动中组织性和阶级觉悟有极大的提高

    张家口市工人店员在“五反”运动中组织性和阶级觉悟有极大的提高
    在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家财产、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中，张家口市私营行业的工人店员已锻炼成为一支有觉悟有组织的强大队伍了。
    张家口市和其他中小城市一样，私营小工厂商店占绝对多数。全市共有工人店员七千一百多人，雇用工人店员五人以下的工厂、商店占全市工商户的百分之八十二点三。违法资本家利用职工分散和一厂一店不能单独形成工会组织的弱点，肆意欺压工人，并用种种威逼利诱手段破坏工会组织。皮毛业大奸商孙阴樊派遣他的亲信窃取了皮毛业工会主席的职务；五金电料业工会也被新华电料行经理许建农、五洲电料行股东王钧等钻了进来。有些奸商拉会计、老店员“入股”，以便阻挡他们加入工会。皮毛业六十一个会计、老店员中，就有百分之七十以上被拉“入股”。许多违法资本家甚至不给工人店员报户口、强迫工人店员填写“临时工志愿书”的办法，限制加入工会。在建筑、木器、粗皮、铁工修制、铸造等手工业中，甚至还存在着严重的封建统治。这些行业中竟有半数工人学徒解放后没有开过一次会和参加过任何政治活动。不少工人学徒还给资本家写有“不参加任何政治活动，资方有任意开除权”等的卖身契。厂主任意打骂虐待工人学徒的现象十分严重。魁顺昌木器厂工徒安富善，一年中竟遭毒打三百四十多次。同时由于职工人数少而又分散，市总工会长期忽视对私营行业工人运动的领导，三年来竟有二千多店员一直未被发现。因此，在这次“五反”运动以前，张家口市私营行业工人运动的基础十分薄弱，组织起来的工人店员仅占总人数的百分之六十，许多行业三年来根本没有建立起工会组织，已经建立的也大部分流于形式主义。“五反”运动开始后，张家口市人民政府、中共张家口市委员会、张家口市总工会等领导机关，即从各个部门抽调大批干部，组成若干工作组，深入各行业普遍发动工人店员。各小组首先以本市违法资本家的具体违法事例，揭穿资产阶级的丑恶本质，号召广大店员和资产阶级划清界限，并发现培养积极分子组成“打虎”队，突击组。在战斗中，以战斗的成果鼓舞工人店员的斗志。在战斗的间隙，又对全市工人店员普遍进行阶级教育和前途教育。工人店员觉悟逐渐提高。永兴隆杂货店会计主任马荫麟在“五反”运动刚开始时，曾给资方烧掉十二本假账，当时他想：“我来到柜上不久，经理就提拔我当会计主任，还给顶上股子，真是恩情难忘！”经过工会干部再三耐心教育，帮助他细算账，他才认识到资方的阴险毒辣，因此他勇敢地检举了违法资本家三年来利用他造假账偷漏税款七亿多元的罪行。在那些至今仍存在着残酷封建统治的行业，工作组便领导广大工人店员结合清除违法厂商的“五毒”进行诉苦。木器、铸造、建筑等行业，都以行业为单位召开大会，当场焚毁了“卖身契”，并对那些残酷打骂虐待工人学徒的违法厂商，进行了控诉斗争。曾经被吉兴魁面庄奴役了三十多年的六十岁老工人胡尚宝，解放后没有参加过任何政治活动，这回也在面粉业工人大会上检举了资方的违法行为，并诉说了他被资本家蒙蔽摆弄的情形。裕成泰绸布庄的会计王吉恭，解放后曾被该号经理拉拢，用他多年来的劳动所得一百多万元入了股，三年来不但没分一次红，还给违法资方造了许多假账。这次运动中，该号经理仍然企图拉拢他，王吉恭参加学习后，坚决地对该号经理说：“三年来你利用咱为非作歹吃肥了，咱再不给你背黑锅了！”当下他就向检查组检举了违法资方的罪行。
    广大店员在阶级觉悟迅速提高之后，都纷纷参加“打虎”队，投入“五反”战斗。气势之猛，超过了过去任何一次运动。从一月中旬到二月初的半个多月中，就有二千多工人店员组织起二百多个“打虎”队。在全市一千多会计、跑外人员中，有七百五十多人参加了“打虎”战斗。原来以青年团店员第一支部十四个团员为基础组成的“打虎”队，不到一个月就壮大为拥有一百多青年店员、会计、跑外人员的战斗大队。他们两个多月来揭发违法厂商的违法事实九百五十多件，这些奸商盗窃国家资财达四十四亿八千多万元。
    张家口市总工会领导工人店员在运动中不断发展和整顿了工会组织。截至目前，全市已建立起五十个行业基层工会，组织起来的工人店员已达六千一百三十人，占总人数的百分之八十五点四。针对过去在组织工作上的缺点，他们将过去许多性质不同的混合成立的行业基层工会，另行分别建立，并在工人店员二十五人以下的厂店里建立组织员，以加强工会的基层组织活动。
    目前该市正计划随着“五反”运动的深入，继续领导广大店员和资本家订立集体合同，调整劳资关系等，以进一步巩固现有成绩。　（新华社）
