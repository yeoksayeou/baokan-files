    Wang Guanying, a Village in the Yellow River Irrigation Area
    Ding Man
    The "People's Victory Canal" for Yellow River irrigation began releasing water on April 10th. Wang Guanying is a village within the irrigation area, surrounded by newly constructed vertical and horizontal canals. The farmers in this village were overjoyed to see the Yellow River water flowing steadily.
    Wang Guanying Village consists of over 380 households, with more than 8,700 mu of land, all of which is sandy soil (commonly known as "lianghe soil"). The farmers call this land "the land that angers the Dragon King (not afraid of floods, only afraid of drought)." However, rainfall is scarce every year, so there is also the saying "nine droughts in ten years." Before liberation, countless major droughts occurred. The farmers will never forget those times. A ballad describing that tragic scene is still widely circulated here:
    "One year no harvest, two years of drought, three consecutive years no crops,
    A rain falls on the third day of the seventh lunar month, every household plants buckwheat,
    A rain falls in mid-July, the buckwheat grows as high as your palm.
    This one says the buckwheat yields 5 bushels, that one says the buckwheat yields 3 bushels.
    White dew falls on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, it's ruined again, cutting the buckwheat soaked and sodden.
    The farmers go to the fields, guarding the buckwheat and weeping to the heavens."
    After liberation in 1948, the farmers of Wang Guanying obtained land through land reform and, through production movements, began a new life. The yield per mu increased from 60 jin per mu before liberation (this area is a cotton-producing region) to over 100 jin per mu. After land reform, the village added more than 100 mules and horses. Last spring alone, the village built more than 200 new houses. But the farmers still couldn't conquer nature and still had to rely on rain. Now, things are different. The Yellow River irrigation project organized by the People's Government has led the farmers of Wang Guanying onto a more secure and happy path. More than 8,700 mu of land in Wang Guanying can now be irrigated. The farmers say, "We will no longer suffer from drought, and we will never be afraid of cotton flowers not forming bolls or millet ears not forming grains!"
    The success of Yellow River irrigation has changed the farmers' long-standing fear of the Yellow River and made them believe in the power of the People's Government to lead the masses to overcome nature and develop agricultural production using scientific methods. "The Yellow River is a hundred harms," "flood monster," "heartless water," people used to call or curse the Yellow River this way. After the Yellow River project started, some farmers actively built the project on the one hand, and suspected that the land could not be irrigated on the other hand. They said, "Canals are dug all over the place, it's uncertain whether the land can be irrigated." "When Maying (within Wuzhi County) breaches, a big river will run here, the branches will be covered with grass, countless people will drown, who can control the water of the Yellow River?" But after the trial water release on March 12, everyone cheered when they saw the Yellow River water flowing steadily through the canals: "In the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, not only can idlers be reformed, but the Yellow River can also be reformed." They ran to the canal gates to observe, and when they saw that the strong gates could be opened and closed freely, they said, "The water can be big when you want it to be, and small when you want it to be, the Yellow River is also under human control." Some farmers even ran to the canals with bowls, quietly scooped a bowl of water, took it back to their homes, and carefully tasted whether the water was bitter or sweet, and whether the sediment in the water was mud or sand. When they tasted that the water was sweet and the sediment was mud, not sand, they jumped up in the streets.
    All groups and households in the village have formulated plans to increase production based on the new situation of dry land being transformed into paddy fields this year, and have launched a bumper harvest competition. The village has planted more than 4,500 mu of cotton, and they guarantee that the yield per mu of ordinary cotton fields will reach more than 250 jin (last year the general yield per mu was 120 jin), and the yield per mu of high-yield land will reach more than 500 jin. To achieve this goal, they carried out deep plowing and careful cultivation. Last year, the cotton fields were plowed once, but this year they were plowed twice, and more fertilizer was applied. This year, 4,000 jin of pen manure and 70-80 jin of fine fertilizer (bean cake, soybeans) were applied per mu of cotton field, twice as much as last year. In addition, they will select good varieties, implement close planting, strengthen management, strictly prevent insect pests, and irrigate lightly and frequently. Now, a bumper harvest competition has been launched in the village, and 57 mu of land have participated in the competition to create high cotton yields.
    In the situation where dry land is transformed into paddy fields, farmers are demanding further organization of labor and animal power. The farmers feel that if all the canals are irrigated at the same time, each household's land is too scattered, and without mutual assistance, it will be impossible to take care of several pieces of land scattered on each canal at the same time. In addition, in terms of cultivation, paddy fields also require more processing than dry land. Therefore, last winter and this spring, the agricultural production mutual aid groups in this village have developed to more than 70% of the total number of households in the village. Among them, there are 12 long-term and relatively solid mutual aid groups, and 52 temporary mutual aid groups have developed. Women have also participated in agricultural production. Farmers are demanding improved cultivation techniques, the use of new farm tools, and the application of more fertilizer. How to increase the yield per unit area of paddy fields is a new question for the farmers here. They say, "In the past, we always said: farming is easy to learn, just do what others do. In the future, we must study hard." They attach great importance to the cotton planting experience of Qu Yaoli, the nationally famous cotton production model; some mutual aid groups always carry the books about Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience that the People's Government has distributed to them, and study whenever they have time. The farmers feel that paddy fields must be deeply cultivated to increase production, so they demand to purchase new farm tools. Some mutual aid groups have proposed to buy ten 10-inch walking plows. The members of the mutual aid group of Li Wenqing, a labor model who had visited the material exchange exhibition in Tianjin, proposed to produce well, accumulate funds, and buy new farm tools. In terms of fertilization, before liberation, farmers had no money to buy fertilizer; after liberation, they had surplus money, but because of frequent droughts, they were afraid that the fertilizer would not be guaranteed, so they did not dare to apply more fertilizer. This year, in one spring, they purchased more than 240,000 jin of bean cake and soybean fertilizer. In order to accumulate fertilizer, they also bought more than 200 piglets to raise this year. In the past, pigs had no pens, but now they are all penned up. Now everyone feels that the land is too scattered and difficult to cultivate, and some people have proposed to exchange land. Irrigation canals are divided into main canals, branch canals, fighting canals, farm canals, and capillary canals; farmers demand that economic regions be divided according to the canals. For example, for land irrigated by the same canal, it is best to plant the same crops, otherwise, if you plant millet and I plant cotton, different crops will result in the phenomenon that you need water and I don't, and it will be impossible to release water at the same time. This year, the farmers of Wang Guanying have generally planted the same crops according to the various irrigation areas. For example, a part of the land adjacent to the village is all wheat; a part of the land adjacent to the village far from the village is all cotton.
    The Yellow River irrigation project has opened up a road to happiness for the farmers. The farmers say, "We must use it to increase our production, strengthen our strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and build a new China that is strong and prosperous." The farmers love the canals and manage them with great responsibility. They say, "This is the precious property of the motherland, and any destruction is a violation of national law."

    引黄灌溉区中的一个农村——王官营
    定曼
    引黄灌溉的“人民胜利渠”四月十日放水了。王官营是灌溉区内的一个村庄，它被新开辟的纵横的渠道围绕着。这个村庄的农民看到黄河的水稳稳当当地流过来的时候，真是欢喜极了。
    王官营村是一个三百八十多户的村庄，有土地八千七百余亩，全是沙质土壤（俗称“两合土”）。农民们称这种土地为“气死龙王地（不怕水淹光怕旱）”。但每年的雨水偏偏十分稀少，所以又有“十年九旱”的说法。解放以前，曾经发生过无数次的大旱灾。对于那种年代，农民们永远也不会忘记。在这里，至今仍普遍流传着描写那种悲惨情景的一首快板：
    “一年不收二年旱，一连三年不收田，
    七月初三下场雨，家家户户把荞麦安（播种），
    七月十几一场雨，荞麦长的如手巅。
    这个说荞麦打石五，那个说荞麦打石三。
    八月十五下白露，又坏啦，把荞麦打的割淹淹，
    庄稼人下地看，守着荞麦哭黄天。”
    王官营在一九四八年解放后，农民在土地改革中获得了土地，又经过生产运动，已经开始了新的生活。每一亩土地的产量，由解放前的每亩产六十斤
    （该地是产棉区）提高到每亩产一百斤以上。土地改革以后，全村增添骡、马一百多头。去年一个春季，全村修建新房屋二百多间。但农民还不能征服自然，还不得不靠天等雨。现在不同了，人民政府举办的引黄灌溉工程，把王官营的农民引到一条更有保证的幸福的道路上来了。王官营的八千七百多亩土地已经可以得到灌溉。农民们说：“我们再不受旱症了，永不怕棉花开花不结桃、谷子出穗不结粒了！”
    引黄灌溉的成功，改变了农民历来恐惧黄河的心理，并使他们相信了人民政府领导群众用科学方法战胜自然发展农业生产的力量。“黄河百害”，“洪水猛兽”，“没良心的水”，从前人们都这样称呼或咒骂黄河。在引黄工程动工以后，有的农民们一方面积极修建工程，一方面又怀疑浇不成地。他们说：“满地挖了河（渠）多道，浇不浇地在两可。”“马营（在武陟县境内）开口时，咱这里跑大河，树枝上挂的都是草，淹死的人无数，谁会使上黄河的水呢？”但在三月十二日试行放水以后，大家看到黄河水稳稳当当地流过渠道时，就欢呼起来：“在毛主席领导下的新中国，不仅能把二流子改造好，还能把黄河改造好。”他们跑到渠道闸门上参观，看到坚固的闸门可以自由地开放和关闭时说：“叫水大就大，叫水小就小，黄河也受人管教了。”也有的农民拿着碗跑到渠道上，悄悄地舀一碗水，端回自己家里，仔细地尝水是苦味还是甜味，看水中沉淀下的是泥还是沙。当他们尝出水是甜水、沉淀的是泥不是沙的时候，就在大街上跳起来了。
    全村各组各户，都根据今年旱田变成了水田的新情况，制定了增产计划，展开了丰产竞赛运动。全村播种四千五百多亩棉花，他们保证一般棉田每亩产量达到二百五十斤以上（去年一般每亩产棉一百二十斤），丰产地每亩达到五百斤以上。为了达到这个目标，他们进行了深耕细作。去年棉田犁一遍，今年都犁了两遍，都增施了肥料。今年每亩棉田上圈肥四千斤，另上细肥（豆饼、豆子）七、八十斤，比去年增加一倍。此外要选用优良品种，实行密植，加强管理，严防虫害，轻浇勤浇。现在全村展开了丰产竞赛运动，参加创造棉花高产量比赛的土地，已有五十七亩。
    在旱田变为水田的情况下，农民要求进一步把劳动力和畜力组织起来。农民们感到，如果各条渠道同时放水灌溉，各户的土地太分散，不互助起来，便无法同时照顾分散在各条渠道上的好几块地。另外，在耕作上，水地比旱地也需要更多的加工。因此，去冬和今春，这村的农业生产互助组发展到全村总户数的百分之七十以上。其中长期的比较巩固的互助组有十二个，临时性的互助组发展到五十二个。妇女们也都参加了农业生产。农民们要求提高耕作技术，使用新式农具和施更多的肥料。如何提高水田的单位面积产量，对这里的农民是个新的问题。他们说：“在过去都是说：庄稼活不用学，人家咋着咱咋着。今后必须好好地学。”他们对全国著名的棉花丰产模范曲耀离的植棉经验极其重视；有些互助组，随时随地都带着人民政府发给他们的关于曲耀离植棉经验的书，一有空就学习。农民们感到水田必须深耕才能增产，因此要求购买新式农具。有些互助组提出要买十张十吋步犁。曾经到天津参观过物资交流展览会的劳动模范李文清的互助组的组员们，提出要好好生产，积累资金，好购买新式农具。在施肥方面，解放前，农民们没余钱买肥料；解放后，有了余钱，又因常常天旱，怕上的肥料不保险，所以也不敢上更多的肥料。今年，一个春季，他们就购买豆饼、豆子肥料二十四万多斤。为了积肥，他们今年还买了二百多口小猪喂养着。过去猪没有圈，现在都圈了起来。现在大家都感到土地太分散，不好耕种，有些人提出要调换土地。灌溉渠道分为干渠、支渠、斗渠、农渠、毛渠；农民要求按渠道划分经济区域。如：凡在一条渠道灌溉下的土地，播种的作物最好一致，不然，你种谷子，我种棉花，作物不同，就会发生你需要水、我不需要水的现象，便无法同时放水。王官营的农民，今年大体上按照各个灌溉区域播种了相同的作物，如村边上相毗邻的一部分土地，全是小麦；距村较远的相毗邻的一部分土地，全是棉花。
    引黄灌溉济卫工程，给农民们开辟了幸福的大道。农民们说：“要用它提高我们的生产，加强抗美援朝的力量，建设一个国强民富的新中国。”农民们热爱渠道，极其负责地管理着它。他们说：“这是祖国的宝贵财产，任何的破坏都是违犯国法。”
