    Suggest that newspapers in various regions publish more essays
    Recently, I saw that the People's Daily had continuously published some essays. For example, the People's Daily published Xie Juezai's "Poisoning Criminal" on page four on March 16th, and Zhang Zhixiang's "'Rolling Back?' 'Crawling Back!'" on page four on March 22nd," etc. These essays provide a great deal of education and enlightenment to readers. Therefore, I suggest that local newspapers should also publish more of this type of article. Hu Chunbo

    建议各地报纸多登载小品文
    最近我看到人民日报曾连续刊登了一些小品文。如三月十六日人民日报四版刊载的谢觉哉写的“放毒犯”、三月二十二日四版刊载的张致祥写的“‘滚回来的？’‘爬回来的！’”，等等。这些小品文给予读者的教育和启发是很大的。因此，我建议各地报纸，也应当多刊登这类的文章。胡春波
