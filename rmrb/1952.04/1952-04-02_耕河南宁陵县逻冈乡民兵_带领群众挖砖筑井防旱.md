    Genghe, Militia in Luogang Township, Ningling County
    Lead the Masses in Digging Bricks to Build Wells for Drought Prevention
    Comrade Editor: The actions of the militia in Luogang Township, Ningling County, Henan Province, in taking the lead in digging bricks and building wells to combat drought are worthy of emulation by various regions. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Luogang Township was either flooded or drought-stricken, and sometimes suffered from wind disasters. However, since liberation, thanks to the People's Government leading the masses in digging rivers and building canals, the area has basically not suffered from floods for three years. At the same time, due to the widespread planting of trees in the East and West Dahuangsha Rivers last spring and winter, wind damage will gradually be reduced in the future. In order to continue to overcome the drought among the natural disasters, the militia captain Liu Guangming and militiamen Chang Faqin, Zhai Shusong, Wang Leisan, Liu Guangyi, Liu Guangyu, Xu Deshun, and Lu Wenhuan led the masses in digging out about 2,000 old bricks from the sand dunes flooded by the Yellow River, and also dug out 3,753 whole bricks from the ruins of the Great King Temple outside the West Gate, preparing material conditions for the township to repair two abandoned wells this year.

    耕河南宁陵县逻冈乡民兵
    带领群众挖砖筑井防旱
    编辑同志：河南省宁陵县逻冈乡民兵带头挖砖筑井抗旱的行动，是值得各地学习的。逻冈乡在国民党反动统治时期不是淹便是旱，有时还要受到风灾。但是这个地区自解放以后，由于人民政府领导群众挖河、修渠，三年来基本上没有受到水灾。同时由于去年春冬两季在东西大荒沙河里普遍植了树，将来风害也可逐渐减少。这个乡的民兵队长刘广明和民兵常法勤、翟树松、王乐三、刘广义、刘广玉、徐德顺、卢文环等，为了继续战胜自然灾害中的旱灾，带动群众在被黄水淹没的沙堆里掘出旧砖约二千块，又在西门外大王庙废基上挖出整砖三千七百五十三块，为该乡今年修复两眼废井准备了物质条件。翟苏
