Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has received a letter dated March 26th from Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, to democratic women's organizations of various countries, calling on women worldwide to take immediate action against the crimes of American imperialism in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Friends:

The crimes of the American army in Korea in waging bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people demand that people take immediate, urgent, and widespread action. This heinous crime must be fully exposed to the people of the world. Millions of peace-loving men and women must exert the greatest pressure on the warmongers so as to safeguard the lives and health of present and future generations of people.

The profound resentment of all women against the use of bacteriological weapons can be transformed into action of decisive significance in declaring bacteriological warfare illegal, fully exposing the American imperialists, and forcing them to sign a Korean armistice agreement.

The appeal to us from Mrs. Gordon expresses the opinions of all of us on this issue. This appeal states:

“The very large women's rallies held to celebrate International Women's Day, upon learning of this news, wish to express deep sympathy to the women and mothers of Korea and China who are experiencing this terrible ordeal. They are fully opposed to this war—the most terrible and insidious of all wars.

The International Democratic Women's Federation calls on all 135 million members to actively respond to the appeal of the Chairman of the World Peace Council and the appeal of Ms. Cai Chang. Because women constitute a large part of public opinion, and especially because they bear the sacred mission of not allowing the lives they have given to be subject to any new threats, their voices must be heard at this decisive moment in world history."

We ask you to launch a large-scale movement dedicated to this purpose, and we are attaching documents related to the bacteriological warfare being waged in Korea. We suggest you carry out the following activities:

1. Write letters, send telegrams, and send protest letters to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York, to President Truman, to the American Embassy in your country, and to your own government.

2. Organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, peace groups, and social groups pass resolutions denouncing the waging of bacteriological warfare.

3. Hold marches, demonstrations, and protest rallies.

4. Use the attached materials in talks with reporters, in articles, at gatherings, and on other occasions.

Please report to us regularly on the detailed progress of the movement in your country.

Greetings,

Vaillant-Couturier (signed)

    国际民主妇联总书记致函各国妇女组织
    号召全世界妇女抗议美国细菌战
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷收到国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬·古久里夫人三月二十六日给各国民主妇女组织的一封信，信上号召全世界妇女对美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行立即采取行动。该信全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    在朝鲜的美国军队对朝中人民进行细菌战的罪行，要求人们立即采取紧急的广泛的行动。必须向全世界人民充分揭露这种滔天罪行，千百万爱好和平的男女必须对战争贩子使用最大的压力，这样才能保障现在和将来的世世代代的人的生命和健康。
    全体妇女对使用细菌武器的深切愤恨，可以化为对宣布细菌战为非法、充分揭发美帝国主义者和强迫他们签订朝鲜停战协定有着决定意义的行动。
    戈登夫人致我们的呼吁书，表达了我们所有的人对这种问题的意见，这篇呼吁书说：
    “为庆祝国际妇女节而举行的声势非常浩大的妇女集会在得悉这个消息以后，愿对正在经历着这种可怕的遭遇的朝鲜和中国的妇女和母亲表示深切的同情，她们全力反对这种战争——一切战争中最恐怖、最阴险的战争。
    国际民主妇女联合会号召所有一亿三千五百万会员积极响应世界和平理事会主席的呼吁和蔡畅女士的呼吁。由于妇女构成舆论的一大部分，特别是由于她们负有不让她们所赋予的生命受到任何新威胁的神圣使命，因此在世界历史上的这个具有决定意义的时刻，她们的声音必须被听到。”
    我们要求你们发动一个致力于这个目的的大规模运动，并附上有关在朝鲜进行的细菌战的文件。我们建议你们进行下列活动：
    一、写信、打电报、寄抗议书给美国纽约联合国秘书长，给杜鲁门总统，给在你们国家的美国大使馆，给你们自己的政府。
    二、各组织、工会、合作社、和平团体和社会团体通过决议，斥责进行细菌战。
    三、举行游行、示威和抗议集会。
    四、在对记者发表的谈话中、文章中、集会中以及其他场合利用所附的材料。
    请你们经常向我们报告你们国家的运动开展的详细情况。敬礼
    瓦扬·古久里夫人（签字）
    一九五二年三月二十六日
