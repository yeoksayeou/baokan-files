Reading "On Communist Education"
　　Zhang Tengxiao

"On Communist Education" (written by Kalinin, published by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House) is a popular book in which Kalinin, based on his revolutionary experiences over twenty years, discusses how the Bolshevik Party carried out propaganda and mobilization work and educational work. This book collects thirty speeches and essays, most of which are speeches given to schools and the Communist Youth League, with the exception of a few that discuss general propaganda and mobilization work. Therefore, this book can be said to be the best and most valuable gift that Kalinin dedicated to the youth of the Soviet Union and the youth of the whole world!

The greatest advantage of this book is that Kalinin, with his unique talent for propaganda and mobilization, has implemented the great communist ideals into all aspects of the Soviet people's lives, work, and struggles. Precisely because of this, it can play a mobilizing and organizing role, and it can encourage the Soviet people to more effectively rise up and wage a resolute struggle against the remnants of capitalist ideology, and consciously become builders of communism.

What kind of person should a true revolutionary be? Kalinin believes that a true revolutionary must first have a solid communist worldview. Because only politicians and social workers who truly possess a communist worldview can correctly understand the environment of their work, understand and plan for the future, and organize and guide the masses to fight; only then can they proceed from the public collective interest, regard the collective cause as above all else, and make the collective cause their first life.

We see that in the revolutionary ranks, there are some people, even those who have participated in the revolution for a long time, who do not truly possess a communist worldview. The purpose of their work is not for the benefit of the collective, but for personal gain. They have no lofty ideals and do not regard "personal suffering" as a "subordinate" thing. When such people first join the revolution, some may work actively, but they often do so to win the praise of their superiors and to be promoted; when the work suits their purposes and hobbies, they can still do it perfunctorily for a while, but once the work cannot show themselves, they will become worried about gains and losses, and even become passive and slack.

In this "Three-Anti" struggle, the problems of these people have been exposed most clearly. Some of them can usually pretend to be "revolutionary" and seem to be fighting for the cause of communism, but in fact, their minds are filled with many bourgeois ideas. They envy the decadent life of the bourgeoisie; they pursue personal fame and status, and so on. In the complex urban environment, they cannot resist the temptations of the outside world, so they degenerate and degenerate, even colluding with illegal capitalists to steal state property, and become criminals of the people's country.

From this, it can be seen how much attention should be paid to Kalinin's view that a solid communist worldview is a necessary condition for a true revolutionary. But how can we establish a solid communist worldview? That requires studying Marxism-Leninism well. Because "the strength of the Bolshevik Party lies in the fact that it is armed with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and completely grasps this weapon." (Page 29) What is meant here by studying Marxism-Leninism is not just reading the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin; still less is it studying for the sake of studying, or studying to decorate one's facade. However, there are many such people in real life. After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution on a national scale, a high tide of learning was widely formed, which is an excellent phenomenon. However, some people, especially
some senior intellectuals, do not study the spirit and essence of Marxism-Leninism, but only study some nouns and terms, and still cling to old things in their bones. These people study Marxism-Leninism not to solve any problems, but to decorate themselves. There are also people who can talk eloquently about everything, but in fact they are self-righteous or ambiguous, and it cannot be said that they are "truly knowledgeable people."

Kalinin said: "To become a Marxist, one should enrich theory with life, and one should link daily work with theory. To become a Marxist means to become a creator." (Page 20) "Only by studying your current concrete phenomena based on Marxist theory can you correctly apply the Marxist method. ... No matter how simple the work, the Marxist's mind should always be unrestrained, researching, and creating."
(Page 21) Here we can see that a true Marxist must "enrich theory with life" and "link daily work with theory," that is, to implement Marxism into life and struggle, and use it to analyze and understand the problems in life and struggle.

In order to universally establish a solid communist worldview among the Soviet people, widely publicizing Marxism-Leninism is a major matter. In this book, Kalinin not only has many brilliant discussions on how to publicize Marxism-Leninism among the masses, but the book itself is also the best example. Kalinin believes that when doing propaganda to the masses, if there is no strong political ideology, even if the articles he writes and the reports he makes are outwardly beautiful and moving, "these are fruitless flowers." He attaches great importance to the method of propaganda, saying: "Propaganda and agitation carried out with facts is much more practical. ... Propaganda and agitation carried out with facts is the most effective propaganda work." (Page 244) Any
one who does propaganda work, whether writing articles or making reports, should start from the specific object and specific environment of your propaganda. He believes that the methods adopted for propaganda work before and during the war are different. He said: "For example, if we go to a collective farmer's conference in a large village to speak, insert a lot of jokes, humorous and witty, colorful and lively, such words may have been welcomed two years ago, causing everyone to laugh, applaud, and make the audience happy. May I ask, can we speak like this now? Of course not." (Page 165) At the same time, the attitude of speaking is also very important. Even if you are very knowledgeable, if you treat the audience with an indifferent attitude, they will not respond. How specifically and minutely Kalinin teaches us how to do propaganda work! Marxism-Leninism is the ideological weapon for the working people of the world to fight for liberation, but some of our comrades have not yet learned how to effectively publicize this ideology to the masses.

In addition to discussing the necessity and methods of establishing a communist worldview, Kalinin also spends a great deal of space specifically discussing the communist morality that the Soviet people must possess. He points out that morality in class society has a profound class nature. He teaches the Soviet people that they must "get rid of the spirit, habits, and customs that have been cultivated by the landlord and bourgeoisie for hundreds of years" (Page 274), and establish new moral standards. These new moral standards are: First, a new attitude towards labor. In the new society, labor is a glorious and heroic undertaking, and people must strive to improve labor productivity. He said: "One of the most important factors in communist construction, and the powerful weapon of Soviet workers in the struggle against capitalism, is high labor productivity." (Page 93) Second, protect and consolidate socialist public property. Kalinin quoted Lenin's words: "When ordinary workers rise up to overcome great difficulties, desperately try to increase labor productivity, and try to protect every pood of grain, coal, iron, and other products, these products do not belong to the workers themselves and their 'close relatives,' but to their 'distant relatives,' that is, to the entire society, to the hundreds of millions of people who initially united into a socialist country and then united into the Union of Soviet Republics, -- this is when communism begins" (Pages 276-277). Lenin regarded people's new, selfless attitude towards public property as the beginning of communism. Third, it is necessary to cherish the socialist motherland. The patriotism of the Soviet people is one of the driving forces for the development of Soviet socialism, and this patriotism is closely linked to internationalism. The Soviet people have a strong belief that even in the most difficult days of war, victory will definitely belong to them. Fourth, the spirit of collectivism. In socialist society, people are organized collectives, and any talented person will accomplish nothing if they leave the collective and the power of the collective. Fifth, it is necessary to improve the people's cultural life. Kalinin said: "Culture can make all beneficial work remarkable. The more complex and refined the work, the greater the culture it requires. We need culture as we need air." (Page 111) "In order to fulfill its mission (author's note: that is, to complete the historical task of the proletariat), the proletariat, together with the collective farmers, should grasp and master the entire heritage of human culture, master all the essence of science and technology, climb to the peak of knowledge, and become the most knowledgeable people in the world." (Page 40)

Kalinin attaches particular importance to carrying out communist education among young people. He believes that schools are important places for systematically carrying out Marxist-Leninist education and cultivating students' communist worldview. We know that with the increasing development of society, science is also developing more and more, the classification of science is becoming more and more refined, and the people who study science must also be more and more specialized, which is a natural trend. However, this hides a crisis, which is that it is easy to fall into the one-sidedness of observing problems. Bourgeois education artificially expands this one-sidedness, only giving students some fragmented and narrow practical knowledge. In order to overcome this crisis and enable students to observe problems comprehensively and scientifically, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, because Marxism-Leninism is a synthesis of the highest achievements of modern natural science and social science. Therefore, any subject must be explained and explained from the perspective of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism.

Kalinin believes that socialist schools and capitalist schools have fundamental differences, and socialist schools do not allow the cultivation of "young masters." He put forward the educational policy of all-round development, and believes that Russian, mathematics, and sports are the basic courses. Because whether in daily life, in order to correctly express one's thoughts and feelings, and to study any science in the future, especially to study social science in the future, it is necessary to have a high level of Russian. Mathematics can enable us to think correctly and rationally, and at the same time, the scope of application in practice is also very wide, and it is the basis for studying all sciences. Why is sports one of the basic courses? Kalinin said: "It is particularly beneficial to widely develop sports and exercise among the people, because this can discipline people, enhance people's physical fitness, can stimulate automatic spirit and initiative, and teach people to cooperate. In a word; if you want to cultivate healthy, strong, agile, witty, courageous, and good at overcoming difficulties, and have confidence in facing the people in front of you, then sports and exercise are very important factors." (Page 34) Kalinin believes that sports activities must be linked to the general construction of socialism. This education policy can also be used as our reference. I think that the ordinary schools in our new China should also take Chinese, mathematics, and sports as the basic courses.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "We should expand the propaganda of communist ideology and step up the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without such propaganda and study, we will not only be unable to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also unable to guide the current democratic revolution to victory." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, Page 677) Kalinin's "On Communist Education" is a very good book for us to publicize communism and study Marxism-Leninism. Our national youth and teachers will surely get many things they need from this book.

    读“论共产主义教育”
    张腾霄
    “论共产主义教育”（加里宁著，苏联外国文书籍出版局印行），是加里宁在二十年内以他亲自经历过的革命经验，论述布尔什维克党如何进行宣传鼓动工作和教育工作的一本通俗的书。这本书收集了三十篇讲演和论文，其中除了几篇是讲一般的宣传鼓动工作之外，大部分是给学校和共产主义青年团所作的讲演。所以这本书可以说是加里宁献给苏联青年和全世界青年最好的和最有价值的礼物！
    这本书最大的优点，就是加里宁以其特有的宣传鼓动的天才，把共产主义的伟大理想贯彻到苏联人民的生活、工作、斗争的各方面中去了。正因为如此，它便能够起动员作用和组织作用，它便能够鼓励苏联人民更有效地起来同资本主义思想残余作坚决斗争，并自觉地成为共产主义建设者。
    一个真正的革命者应该是怎样的人物呢？加里宁认为真正的革命者首先必须有巩固的共产主义人生观。因为只有真正具备了共产主义人生观的政治家和社会工作人员才能正确地了解他的工作的环境，了解和规划今后的前途，并组织群众、引导群众去进行战斗；才能从公共的集体利益出发，把集体事业看作高于一切的，以集体事业为第一生命。
    我们看到在革命队伍中，有一些人，甚至是参加革命许久的人，他们没有真正具备共产主义的人生观。他们工作的目的，不是为了集体的利益，而是为了个人的利益。他们没有任何高尚的理想，不是把“个人疾苦”作为“从属”的东西。这种人在初参加革命时，有的可能积极工作，但是他们往往是为了博得上级的称赞，自己能得到提拔；在工作适合于自己的目的和爱好时，还能敷敷衍衍地做一阵，一旦工作不能表现自己时，便会患得患失，甚至消极怠工起来。
    在这次“三反”斗争中，这种人的毛病暴露得最明显不过了。他们有的平时也可以装成“革命”的样子，也好像是在为共产主义事业奋斗似的，其实，他们的脑子里装有许多资产阶级思想。他们羡慕资产阶级的堕落生活；追求个人的名誉和地位等等。而在复杂的城市环境里，他们经不起外界的引诱，于是堕落蜕化，以至和违法资本家勾结起来盗窃国家财产，竟变为人民国家的罪人了。
    由此可见，对于加里宁关于巩固的共产主义人生观是真正的革命者的必要条件的见解，是应该如何地加以重视了。可是，怎样才能树立巩固的共产主义人生观呢？那就需要好好地学习马克思列宁主义。因为“布尔什维克党底力量就在于它是由马、恩、列、斯底学说所武装起来的，并且完备地把握着这一武器。”（第二九页）这里所说的要学习马克思列宁主义，不是仅仅是熟读马、恩、列、斯的著作；更不是为学习而学习，或是为装饰门面而学习。然而，在现实生活中却有不少这样的人。中国人民革命在全国范围内胜利后，曾经广泛形成学习的高潮，这是极好的现象。但是有一些人，特别是
    一些高级知识分子，他们不是学习马克思列宁主义的精神和实质，而只是学习一些名词和术语，骨子里依然抱着旧东西不放。这种人学习马克思列宁主义，本来就不是要来解决什么问题，而是为了把自己装璜一番。还有的人对于一切问题都能夸夸其谈，但其实是自以为是或似是而非，根本说不上他是个“真有学问的人”。
    加里宁说：“要成为马克思主义者，就应该用生活来充实理论，就应该把日常工作与理论联系起来。要成为马克思主义者，就是说，要成为创作家。”（第二十页）“只有根据马克思主义理论，来研究你们当前的具体现象，你们才能正确地运用马克思主义的方法。……不管工作怎样简单，马克思主义者底思想永远应当奔放着，研究着，创造着。”
    （第二一页）在这里我们可以看出，真正的马克思主义者必须“用生活来充实理论”，“把日常工作与理论联系起来”，就是要把马克思主义贯彻到生活和斗争中去，用它来分析和认识生活和斗争中的问题。
    为了普遍地在苏联人民当中树立巩固的共产主义人生观，广泛地宣传马克思列宁主义是一件重大的事情。在这本书里，加里宁对于如何在群众中宣传马克思列宁主义，不仅有许多精辟的论述，而且这本书的本身就是一个最好的范例。加里宁认为在向群众作宣传时，如果没有强烈的政治思想性，即使他所写的文章和所作的报告在外表上如何漂亮动听，“这都是无花之果”。对于宣传的方式他是异常重视的，他说：“用事实来进行的宣传与鼓动，是更加实际得多的。……用事实来进行的宣传及鼓动，乃是最有效的宣传工作。”（第二四四页）任何
    一个做宣传工作的人，不论是写文章或作报告，都从你宣传的具体对象和具体环境出发。他认为在战前和战时的宣传工作所采的方式是不一样的。他说：“例如，我们要是到某个大村庄的集体农民大会去发言，插上很多笑话，戏谑诙谐，有声有色，这类言词在两年以前，也许能受到欢迎，引起大家笑笑，鼓鼓掌，弄得听众高兴一番。试问，目前能够这样去讲话吗？当然不行的。”（第一六五页）同时，讲话的态度也是很重要的，即使你很有学问，如果你是以漠不关心的态度去对待听众，他们是不会有反应的。加里宁是多么具体而微地教导我们怎样做宣传工作啊！马克思列宁主义是世界劳动人民争取解放的思想武器，然而我们有些同志还没有学会有效地向群众宣传这种思想。
    加里宁除了谈论树立共产主义人生观的必要性和方法以外，还用很大篇幅来具体论述苏联人民所必须具备的共产主义道德。他指出阶级社会里的道德是有深刻的阶级性的。他教导苏联人民必须“摆脱掉那种种由地主资产阶级几百年来的统治所薰陶的精神、习惯和风俗”（二七四页），而树立新的道德标准。这新的道德标准就是：第一、对于劳动的新态度。在新社会里劳动是一种光荣和英雄的事业，人们必须为提高劳动生产率而奋斗。他说：“共产主义建设最重要的因素之一，以及苏联劳动者在与资本主义作斗争中的雄强武器，便是高度的劳动生产率。”（第九三页）第二、保护和巩固社会主义的公有财产。加里宁转引列宁的话：“当一般普通工人起来克服极大困难，奋不顾身地设法增加劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不是归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而是归他们的‘远亲’，即归全社会所有，归千百万起初联合为一个社会主义国家，然后又联合为苏维埃共和国联盟的人们所有，——这也就是共产主义开始了的时候”（第二七六—二七七页）。列宁是把人们对于公共财产的新的大公无私的态度作为共产主义的开始来看待的。第三、是要爱护社会主义的祖国。苏维埃人们的爱国主义是苏维埃社会主义发展的动力之一，而这种爱国主义又是和国际主义密切联系着的。苏维埃人民有坚强信念，即在战争中最困难的时日里，都相信胜利是一定属于他们的。第四、集体主义的精神。在社会主义社会里，人们都是有组织的集体，任何有才干的人，如果离开了集体和集体的力量，都将是一事无成的。第五、要提高人民的文化生活水平。加里宁说：“文化性能使一切有益工作卓著成效。工作愈复杂和愈精致，它也就需要更大的文化性。我们需要文化，就像需要空气一样。”（第一一一页）“为要完成自己这一使命（作者注：即完成无产阶级的历史任务），无产阶级与集体农民一起，应该把握并精通人类文化的全部遗产，掌握科学与技术底一切精华，攀升到知识底极峰，成为全世界最有学问的人。”（第四○页）
    加里宁对于在青年中进行共产主义教育特别重视，他认为学校是系统地进行马克思列宁主义教育、培养学生共产主义人生观的重要场所。我们知道，随着社会的日益发展，科学也日益向前发展着，科学的分类是越来越精细的，而研究科学的人也必然是越来越是专门化的，这是自然的趋势。然而这就隐伏着一种危机，就是容易走到观察问题的片面性。而资产阶级教育则是人工地扩大这种片面性，只给学生一些零零碎碎的、狭隘的实用知识。我们为了克服这一危机，使学生能全面地、科学地观察问题，就必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，因为马克思列宁主义是综合了现代自然科学和社会科学最高的成果。所以任何学科都必须以马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物论的观点来加以解释和说明。
    加里宁认为社会主义的学校和资本主义的学校有原则的不同，社会主义学校不允许培养出“公子哥儿”来。他提出了全面发展的教育方针，并认为俄文、数学、体育这三门是基本的课程。因为无论在日常生活中，为了正确地表达自己的思想感情，和将来学习那一种科学，特别是将来要研究社会科学，是需要有很高的俄文程度的。数学它可以使我们正确地和合理地思想，同时在实际中应用的范围也是很广泛的，它是研究一切科学的基础。体育为什么成为基本课程之一呢？加里宁说：“在人民中广泛发展体育和运动是特别有益的，因为这可以使人们纪律化，增强人们的体质，可以激发自动精神和主动性，教会人们去协同动作。一言以蔽之；若要培养健康，强壮，灵敏，机智，勇敢，既善于克服困难，又卓有信心正视前面的人，则体育和运动乃是很重要的因素。”（第三四页）加里宁认为必须把体育活动同社会主义的一般建设事业联系起来。这个教育方针也可以做我们的参考。我觉得我们新中国的普通学校也应以国语、数学和体育三门为基本课程。
    毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中说：“应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，没有这种宣传和学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命达到胜利。”（“毛泽东选集”第二卷第六七七页）加里宁的“论共产主义教育”是我们宣传共产主义和学习马克思列宁主义的一本很好的书。我们全国青年们和教师们从这本书里一定能得到许多他们需要的东西。
