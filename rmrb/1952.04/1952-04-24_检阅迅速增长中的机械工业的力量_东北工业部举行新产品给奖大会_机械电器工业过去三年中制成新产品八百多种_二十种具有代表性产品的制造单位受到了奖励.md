    Reviewing the Rapidly Growing Strength of the Machinery Industry
    The Northeast Industrial Department Holds an Awards Ceremony for New Products
    More Than 800 New Products Have Been Made in the Machinery and Electrical Industries in the Past Three Years
    Manufacturing Units of 20 Representative Products Were Rewarded
    The Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department, in order to expand the manufacturing of new products and prepare conditions for large-scale economic construction, held an awards ceremony for new mechanical and electrical products on April 14th. In addition to reviewing 20 representative important new products at the meeting, awards were also given to the units that successfully manufactured these products.
    The machinery and electrical industries in the Northeast have successfully manufactured more than 800 new products in the past three years, and more than 300 more can be trial-produced by the end of this year. This is a significant event, indicating that:
    (1) The proportion of the machinery industry in the overall industrial production of the Northeast is rapidly increasing, and it has developed from producing small and simple machines to being able to manufacture larger and newer precision machines. The 800 kW hydro-turbine generator, 106 mm shaper, No. 2 universal milling machine, and Soviet-style all-gear lathe, which were commended at this meeting, are all new types of machines with complex parts and precise structures, and of high quality. For example, the No. 2 universal milling machine has 16 speed variations, and the cutting tool can cut horizontally, vertically, or obliquely. The specifications of the finished product vary by a maximum of two si (Note: one si is approximately one-seventh of the diameter of a hair).
    (2) The successful manufacture of many new products plays a significant role in meeting the requirements of current infrastructure construction and the large-scale construction work that is about to come. In large-scale construction, basic industries such as steel, iron, coal, and electricity must be built first, and the most fundamental problem in building these basic industries is to have good equipment. The various machines, equipment, and major components that have been successfully manufactured, such as herringbone gears (extremely important components for mining, metallurgy, and cement equipment), 300-meter and 500-meter drilling machines urgently needed for prospecting mineral resources, corundum (the raw material for grinding wheels, an important grinding tool in the mechanical industry), 1,000-ton hydraulic presses (the main equipment for manufacturing electrodes for electric furnace smelting), as well as 13,800-volt high-voltage coils, steam turbine blades, and gas turbine diaphragms (essential for repairing and restoring power generation equipment), are all important contributions to industrial construction.
    (3) In the process of manufacturing new products, each unit not only overcame various technologically conservative viewpoints, but also accumulated extremely valuable technical experience and cultivated a large number of technical talents. In the more than 800 new products trial-produced in the past three years, almost every trial production was the result of fully utilizing the creativity of employees and overcoming various equipment and technical difficulties. For example, when the No. 5 Electric Factory was manufacturing the turbine casing of the 800 kW hydro-turbine generator, one type of component weighing three tons could not be processed due to the lack of a large precision horizontal lathe. At that time, some people thought this was an insurmountable difficulty. Liu Jigui, a veteran technical worker with 37 years of experience, modified an old drilling machine into a lathe to solve this difficulty. Because the modified lathe only weighed two and a half tons and could not support the three-ton component, Liu Jigui came up with the idea of ​​building a platform in front of the bed and placing the component on the platform so that the lathe could follow the component for processing. Zhang Daquan, a young fitter, who had no understanding of the equipment technology of hydro-turbine generators in the past, has now mastered all the equipment work skillfully after being trained in manufacturing. They are currently manufacturing large generators many times larger than 800 kW based on the experience they have gained.
    In order to further expand the manufacturing of new products in the future, Lu Dong, Deputy Minister of the Northeast Industrial Department, commended the units that successfully manufactured 20 new products one by one at the meeting, and then called on the leading cadres of various enterprises to give full attention to the manufacturing of new products, and not to adopt short-sighted practices, and not only see today and not see tomorrow. He said: What will be produced next year, the trial production work must be done well this year. Not paying attention to the trial production of new products means not paying attention to the preparation work for industrial construction. Therefore, each mechanical and electrical factory should include trial production work in the production plan. Each factory should have a new product trial production plan every year, and check the work based on this plan. When discussing the trial production of new products in May this year, the plan should be told to the workers, and everyone should be mobilized to work hard to complete it. This is the glorious task of all employees. (Xinhua News Agency)

    检阅迅速增长中的机械工业的力量
    东北工业部举行新产品给奖大会
    机械电器工业过去三年中制成新产品八百多种
    二十种具有代表性产品的制造单位受到了奖励
    东北人民政府工业部为扩大新产品的制造工作，给大规模的经济建设准备条件，在四月十四日举行了机械、电器新产品的奖励大会。会上除检阅了二十种具有代表性的重要新产品外，还对制造这些产品获得成功的单位进行了奖励。
    东北的机械、电器工业在过去三年中，已制造成功的新产品共达八百多种，到今年年底为止，还可试造出三百多种。这是一个具有重大意义的事件，它表明了：
    （一）东北的机械工业在整个工业生产中的构成比重已在迅速地增长，并且已从生产小型的简单的机器，发展到能够制造较大型的和新式的精密机器。这次会上所表扬的八百瓩水轮发电机和一零六公厘摚床、二号万能铣床、苏联式全齿轮车床等，都是机件复杂、构造精密的新式的机器，且质量很高。如二号万能铣床运转速度的变化有十六种之多，切削刀可以平切、立切或斜切，制成品的规格最多不差二丝（按：一丝约一根头发直径的七分之一）。
    （二）很多新产品的制造成功，不论对满足目前基本建设的要求，或对即将到来的更大规模的建设工作，都有很大的作用。在大规模建设中，首先要建设钢、铁、煤、电等基本工业，而建设这些基本工业的最根本问题，必须有好的装备。已制造成功的各种机器、设备和重大部件，如矿山、冶金、水泥设备上极重要的部件人字齿轮，勘查矿源急需的三百公尺及五百公尺钻探机，机械工业中重要的研磨工具（砂轮）的原料金刚砂，制造电炉冶炼用电极主要设备的千吨油压机，以及抢修和恢复发电设备必需的一万三千八百伏特高压线圈，蒸气透平汽叶，气透平隔板等，都是对工业建设的重要贡献。
    （三）各单位在新产品的制造过程中，不但克服了各种技术保守观点，而且积累了极为宝贵的技术经验，培养了大批的技术人材。在三年来所试制的八百多种新产品中，几乎每一件试制工作都是充分发挥了职工的创造才能，克服了设备和技术上的种种困难的结果。如电工五厂在制造八百瓩水轮发电机上的水轮机涡壳时，曾因缺少大型的精密卧式镟床，使三吨重的一种部件无法加工。当时有些人认为这是不可克服的困难。具有三十七年工龄的老技术工人刘积贵，把一台已经旧了的钻床改为镟床，用来解决这个困难。由于改造的镟床只有两吨半重，支持不住三吨重的部件，刘积贵便又想法在床前垒起一个平台，把部件放在平台上，使镟床跟着加工部件转。青年钳工张大全，过去对水轮发电机的装备技术根本不懂，经过制造中的锻炼后，现在已能熟练地掌握全部装备工作。目前他们正根据已得的经验，制造比八百瓩还大许多倍的大型发电机。
    为了今后进一步扩大新产品的制造工作，东北工业部副部长吕东在会上一一表扬了二十种新产品制造成功的单位后，即号召各企业的领导干部对于新产品的制造工作，应给予充分的重视，不要有近视的作法，不要只看到今天而看不到明天。他说：明年要生产什么，今年就一定要把试制工作做好，不重视新产品的试制，就是不重视工业建设的准备工作。因此，各机械、电器工厂应该把试制工作列入生产计划之中。工厂里每年应有一个新产品试制计划，根据这一计划来检查工作。在今年五月份讨论试制新产品工作时，要把计划告诉工人，并发动大家来努力完成，这是全体职工的光荣任务。（新华社）
