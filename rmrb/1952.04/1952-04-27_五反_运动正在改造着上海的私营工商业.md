The "Five-Anti" Movement is Transforming Shanghai's Private Industry and Commerce

By our reporter Gu Weijin

The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has been underway for two phases. It has severely struck at the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists' attacks on the state and the people, and unprecedentedly raised the consciousness of the vast number of workers and staff as masters of their own affairs, prompting them to actively supervise capitalists to improve business management and exert a high degree of labor enthusiasm. On this basis, the People's Government vigorously supports private enterprises. Correct public-private and labor-capital relations are being established.

The great power of the people has eliminated the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists

The "five poisons" of illegal capitalists in Shanghai are serious. In the first phase of the "Five-Anti" movement, a random sample of seventy-four industrial and commercial households (not the largest, nor those with the most serious problems) revealed that each household had stolen state property worth hundreds of millions, billions, or even hundreds of billions of yuan. In the second phase of the "Five-Anti" movement, it was discovered that some illegal industrial and commercial households had stolen state property worth more than one hundred billion yuan. These illegal capitalists' acts of theft have caused incalculable losses to the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, national construction, and the people's livelihood.

When the "Five-Anti" movement was still in the preparatory stage, these illegal capitalists attempted to use various cunning and stubborn means to get through the "Five-Anti" "barrier." However, since the official start of the "Five-Anti" movement on March 25, the Shanghai Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee actively mobilized workers and shop assistants, won over senior staff, and conducted work among the families of illegal capitalists, truly grasped the materials of illegal capitalists, publicized policies, and made them understand the greater good. All of this laid a dragnet for illegal capitalists. The vast majority of illegal capitalists had no choice but to confess their crimes. For example, Ma Zipei, the deputy manager of Anli Company, was a representative of the district consultation committee and the director of the neighborhood residents' committee; he attempted to use this political position to get through the inspection with false confessions and other means. However, under the encouragement of the inspection team for workers and shop assistants to report him, under the persuasion of his wife and daughters, and under the evidence of the inspection team's correct materials, he finally could not resist, felt his own meanness and filth, cried bitterly, and confessed his crimes. Another example is the Huaxin Instrument and Stationery Factory, where the three managers and deputy managers were brothers born of the same mother. The "alliance of offense and defense" they made was called the "blood alliance," and they once thought this was the most "reliable." However, after the inspection team mobilized the masses, not only did employees and relatives come forward to report them, but the eldest and third brothers in the "blood alliance" also came forward to report the second brother; the "blood alliance" had to declare bankruptcy, and everyone confessed their crimes. The great power of the people shattered all the tricks of illegal capitalists to resist the "Five-Anti." Under this education, illegal capitalists truly saw the power of the working class. For future development, they had to choose a correct path. At a symposium convened by the Shanghai Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee of seventy-four illegal industrial and commercial households that had completed their inspections, many illegal capitalists expressed this way: "From now on, we must abide by the rules under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy."

The working class has raised its consciousness as masters of its own affairs and unites with capitalists to improve production

The great "Five-Anti" movement not only severely struck at the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists in Shanghai, but more importantly, it gave the vast number of workers and staff profound class education. They resolutely drew a clear line between themselves and bourgeois ideology, unprecedentedly raised their political enthusiasm and consciousness as masters of their own affairs, and played the active role of the leading class. After inspection, many factories and shops, in order to consolidate the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, put forward the slogan "The Five-Anti has won the battle, production must win the battle even more." They actively urged and assisted capitalists to improve business management. After the Shanghai Pencil Factory was inspected, the factory's employees made two suggestions to the capitalists: 1. Organize a production cost research group to study how to improve the quality of finished products, save raw materials, and reduce costs, so as to supply the people with inexpensive and high-quality cultural tools; 2. Establish a finished product inspection system to ensure that no substandard or inferior products leave the factory, so as to reduce the losses of the people. These two suggestions were approved by the capitalists and have begun to be implemented. At the Zhonghua Iron Factory, the day after the inspection team left, the union production committee held a production meeting, accepting many opinions put forward by employees, such as improving the production system, strengthening cultural and technical learning, establishing labor discipline, and promoting advanced working methods. An estimating committee was established to adopt a piece-rate system for future production, so as to carry out reasonable rewards and stimulate production enthusiasm. An inspection committee was established to strictly inspect product specifications. The Huaxin Instrument and Stationery Factory accepted the employees' demands, convened a labor-capital meeting, and drew up a production process table, so that future work could be carried out step by step and in a planned manner. The Dam Ming Ink Factory studied how to promote business at the labor-capital consultation meeting and formulated eight patriotic covenants. The fire workers' team of the Baofuji Steel Construction Factory stipulated in the revised patriotic covenant that they would ensure that they would not do work for the boss that cut corners; if they found that the boss had illegal acts, they would immediately report them to the government. These measures are a good start for capitalists who have violated the law in the past to improve their business management.

In order to further assist capitalists in improving production, the vast number of employees have greatly exerted their labor enthusiasm in the production process. For example, when the Baofuji Steel Construction Factory received an order for the Huai River harnessing project, the workers prepared for the work before the raw materials arrived at the factory. During the work process, airport worker Lu Xinquan constantly used his brains and improved the operation method, increasing the output of the coal feeder chain by 700% compared to before. Yao Jinbao, a worker in the electric welding workshop, also improved the operation method and completed twenty days' worth of work in one day. When the Dalong Machine Factory received an order for the Huai River harnessing project, the employees completed the project in thirteen days, which would normally take a month, due to their selfless labor; the inspection results showed that all the finished products met the specifications. Under the slogan of "improving technology," Ying Shunnian, an old worker at the Xin'an Electric Motor Factory, modified a planer from one blade to four blades, increasing the efficiency of the planer by three times and solving the difficulty in supplying DC motor commutator copper bars. Shen Junpei, a staff member of the factory's engineering department, took the initiative to discuss with the sand casting workers how to improve the quality of a part of the motor, resulting in a reduction in the unit price of this part from 28,000 yuan per pound to 18,000 yuan. Many shop assistants actively tried to improve business (such as checking sales specifications, changing attitudes towards customers, etc.), and the business situation of the stores has greatly improved. For example, the Xingchang Industrial Raw Material Company had a monthly turnover of about 60-70 million yuan a few months ago, but now its turnover is more than 100 million yuan in ten days. The sales of Gongyu Pigment Company were only 200-300 million yuan per month in February and March, but from April 1st to 5th, it did more than 200 million yuan in business.

It should be pointed out that the active supervision and assistance of the vast number of employees to capitalists in improving production is only a beginning. They have infinite production potential that will continue to be unleashed. The "Five-Anti" movement has greatly raised the awareness of the working class as masters of their own affairs, which is very beneficial to the development of production in private industry and commerce.

The government vigorously supports private enterprises and initially establishes normal public-private relations

After eliminating the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists, the People's Government vigorously supported private enterprises in order to take care of the difficulties in production during the off-season of private enterprises. In March, fourteen state-owned companies, including cotton yarn, department store, and industrial equipment companies, and the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, supported more than 5,000 private factories in production through processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans. In the first half of April, state-owned trade departments and the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China supported more than 3,000 private factories in thirty-four major industries in production in these ways. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the People's Government's support for private enterprises has special significance: on the one hand, state-owned trade departments accepted the experience and lessons of the "Three-Anti" movement, initially implemented a serious investigation and research work method in commissioned processing and ordering, and initially implemented the policy of relying on the working class and taking the mass line; on the other hand, capitalists truly saw the power of the working class in the "Five-Anti" movement and realized that they must obey the leadership of the state-owned economy in order to have a future for development. Therefore, normal public-private relations appeared in the transaction. For example, when state-owned department stores commissioned private manufacturers to process or order goods from private manufacturers, they first relied on the employees of private manufacturers to more accurately calculate the cost of various commodities, and then signed a more reasonable contract based on the voluntary consent of the capitalists: 1. It is agreed that the delivery date shall not be changed. If it is necessary to deliver goods in advance or delay due to special reasons, an application must be submitted in advance and approved by the party commissioning the processing and ordering. 2. Those who delay the delivery date without reason shall pay a penalty of one percent of the total amount of the current goods for each day of delay. 3. The quality of the ordered goods must be completely consistent with the sample at the time of the transaction. There should be no cutting corners or adulteration; otherwise, in addition to compensating for all losses, they are willing to be punished by state law. 4. The cost price must be correct and reasonable. If there are any illegal acts such as intentional deception, speculation, or the pursuit of exorbitant profits, once discovered, they will be handled in the same way as in Article 3. In order to ensure the implementation of the contract, the grassroots trade union acts as a witness. The implementation of these measures has greatly reduced the possibility of illegal capitalists speculating, taking advantage of loopholes, and seeking exorbitant profits.

The establishment of normal public-private relations is educating and promoting Shanghai's capitalists: in order to obtain legitimate profits, they must rely on the working class to improve business management.

After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the People's Government's support for private enterprises has more effectively played the leading role of the state-owned economy. This will inevitably promote the development of private enterprises in a legitimate direction.

Illegal capitalists begin to correct their business style

The "Five-Anti" movement is the most powerful education for illegal capitalists. After the people helped them eliminate the "five poisons," after the employees urged and assisted them to improve business management and strive to increase production, after the People's Government vigorously supported them, and after the initial establishment of normal public-private relations, many people began to realize: as long as they obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy and honestly be a legitimate industrialist and businessman, there is naturally a bright future. Therefore, the capitalists of many factories and shops have begun to settle down and manage their businesses. For example, the Yongchang Cotton Weaving Factory had many concerns in the past and evaded sixteen machines, but now it has decided to take all of them back to the factory. Shanyutai Woolen Yarn Shop also evaded a large amount of wool due to concerns, but now it has sent a telegram to other places to retrieve the wool. In order to improve its future business, the New World Shipping Company decided to repair its ships, improve shipping performance, and reduce shipping costs. At the same time, many factories and shops began to correct their business style. For example, the Huafu Industrial Raw Material Company has always made a living by speculation, so that raw materials are not bought and machines rust. Now, the boss has decided to recover debts and immediately enter off-book assets into the books; the factory has added pumps and baking equipment; it has stopped selling all non-standard goods, and all packaging materials with insufficient unit weight are fully replenished, and counterfeit and inferior goods are all canceled. Lihua Pharmacy decided to stop selling dozens of boxes of expired penicillin, precipitated calcium needles, and deteriorated 606 injections. Zhuangziji Hardware Store used to often sell old iron pipes as new ones; now, when selling such goods, they first explain the actual situation to customers and sell them at a reduced price. After the employees and bosses of many stores reasonably calculated the cost, they reduced the selling price of commodities. Taikang Company has reduced the selling price of various biscuits by an average of about 10%. The price of some canned foods has been reduced by 40% at the listed price. Lihua Pharmacy used to sell 12 pieces of penicillin for 36,000 yuan, but now it has reduced it to 25,000 yuan. Zhuangziji Hardware Store has reduced the selling price of five-fourths of the galvanized iron pipes from 15,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan per foot. Although the price of commodities has been reduced, the boss is still profitable. Taking the fire watch and tracing paper sold by the Dachina Electric Appliance Company as an example, although the selling price of these two commodities has been reduced by 20% and 40% respectively, they can still earn 40,000 yuan for each fire watch sold, and they can also obtain a profit of about 17% for each pound of tracing paper sold. The situation of the Tongchang Car Company is the same. Although the selling price of each Swallow brand bicycle has been reduced from 1.96 million yuan to 1.52 million yuan, the profit is still 20%.

The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai is transforming private industry and commerce in all aspects. Shanghai is the place where China's industry is most concentrated, the place where China's national bourgeoisie is most concentrated, and also the place that has been most deeply poisoned by comprador and bureaucratic capital for more than a hundred years. Today, the transformation of Shanghai's private industry and commerce by the "Five-Anti" movement is of great significance to the national new democratic economic construction.

    “五反”运动正在改造着上海的私营工商业
    本报记者  古维进
    上海的“五反”运动已经进行了两期。它严重地打击了违法资本家向国家和人民进攻的“五毒”，空前地提高了广大职工的主人翁的自觉，使他们积极起来督促资方改进经营管理和发挥高度的劳动热忱。在这样的基础上，人民政府大力扶植私营企业。正确的公私关系和劳资关系正在建立着。
    人民群众的伟大力量，清除了违法资本家的“五毒”
    上海违法资本家的“五毒”是严重的。在“五反”第一期里，随便抽查七十四户工商户（还不是最大的户，也不是问题最严重的户），就发现各户盗窃国家的财产，都有数亿元、数十亿元以至数百亿元之多。在“五反”第二期里，更发现有些违法工商户盗窃国家财产在千亿元以上。这些违法资本家的盗窃行为，对于抗美援朝、国家建设、人民生活，都造成了难以估计的损失。
    当“五反”运动还在准备阶段的时候，这些违法资本家曾经企图用各种狡猾刁顽的手段混过“五反”的“关”。但是，自三月二十五日“五反”运动正式开始以后，上海市增产节约委员会积极发动工人店员，争取高级职员，并在违法资本家的家属中间进行工作，确实掌握了违法资本家的材料，宣传了政策，晓以大义。这一切就给违法资本家布下了天罗地网。绝大多数违法资本家不得不坦白认罪。例如安利公司副经理马子培，是区协商委员会的代表、里弄居民委员会主任；他企图利用这个政治地位，以假坦白等手段把检查混过去。可是，在检查队发动工人店员检举之下，在他的妻子女儿规劝之下，在检查队的正确材料对证之下，他终于无可抗拒，感到了自己的卑鄙龌龊，痛哭一场，坦白了自己的罪行。又如华新仪器文具厂，正副经理三人是一母同生的兄弟，他们订立的“攻守同盟”叫做“血统同盟”，他们曾认为这是再“牢靠”也没有的了。但是，当检查队发动群众之后，不仅职工和亲属起来检举，就是“血统同盟”里头的老大和老三也起来检举老二；“血统同盟”不得不宣告破产，大家坦白认罪。人民群众的伟大力量，粉碎了违法资本家抗拒“五反”的一切伎俩。违法资本家在这个教育之下，真正看见了工人阶级的力量。为了今后的发展，他们不得不选择一条正当的道路。在上海市增产节约委员会召集的七十四户已检查完毕的违法工商户的座谈会上，许多违法资本家就这样表示：“我伲今后要在工人阶级和国营经济领导下规规矩矩办事。”
    工人阶级提高了主人翁的自觉，团结资方搞好生产
    伟大的“五反”运动不仅严重地打击了上海违法资本家的“五毒”，更重要的是给了广大职工以深刻的阶级教育。他们坚决地和资产阶级思想划清界限，空前地提高了自己的政治积极性和主人翁的自觉，发挥了领导阶级的积极作用。许多工厂商店经过检查以后，职工为了巩固“五反”运动的胜利成果，提出“五反打了胜仗，生产更要打胜仗”的口号。他们积极督促和协助资方改进经营管理。上海铅笔厂被检查完毕之后，这个厂的职工就向资方提出两点建议：一、组织生产成本研究组，研究提高成品质量、节省原料、减低成本，以供给人民以价廉物美的文化工具；二、建立成品验查制度，保证不让次货、劣货出厂，以减少人民的损失。这两个建议得到了资方的赞同，并已开始实行。在中华铁工厂，检查队离开的第二天，工会生产委员会就召开生产会议，接受职工提出的改善生产制度、加强文化技术学习、树立劳动纪律、推进先进工作方法等许多意见。成立估工委员会，对今后的生产采取估工定额制度，以便进行合理的奖励，激发生产情绪。成立检查委员会，严格检查产品规格。华新仪器文具厂接受职工的要求，召开劳资会议，拟出一份生产过程表，使今后的工作能够有步骤有计划地进行。大鸣油墨厂在劳资协商会议上，研究如何推进业务，并订出八条爱国公约。包福记钢铁建筑工厂火工小组，在修订的爱国公约中规定，保证不代老板做偷工减料的活；如果发现老板有不法行为，立即向政府检举。以上这些措施，对于过去违法的资本家改进经营管理，是一个良好的开端。
    广大职工为了进一步协助资方搞好生产，更在生产过程中大大发挥劳动热忱。例如包福记钢铁建筑工厂，接到治淮工程的定货时，原料还没有到厂，工人就把准备工作做好了。在工作过程中，机场工人陆新泉不断开动脑筋，改进了操作方法，使加煤机链条的产量比以前提高百分之七百。电焊工场工人姚金宝也改进了操作方法，一天完成二十天的任务。大隆机器厂接到治淮工程的定货时，由于职工忘我地劳作，把一个月才能完成的工程，十三天就完成了；检查结果，成品都合规格。在“改进技术”的口号下，新安电机厂老工人应顺年把刨刀由一把改装为四把，使刨床的工作效率增加三倍，解决了直流马达整流子铜排供应的困难。这个厂的工务科的职员沈君佩，主动地和翻砂工人讨论如何改善马达上的一种零件的品质，结果使这种零件的单价由每磅二万八千元减到一万八千元。许多店员积极设法改进业务（如检查售货规格，改变对顾客的态度等），商店的营业情况大为好转。如兴昌工业原料行，数月前，每月的营业额约六七千万元，现在十天的营业就有一亿多元。公裕颜料行二、三月份每月营业额都不过二三亿元，四月一日至五日就做了二亿多元的生意。
    应当指出，广大职工这样积极督促和协助资方搞好生产，还仅仅是一个开始。他们还有无穷的生产潜力，将要继续发挥。“五反”运动提高了工人阶级的主人翁的自觉以后，对于私营工商业发展生产是非常有利的。
    政府大力扶植私营企业，初步建立正常的公私关系
    消除了违法资本家的“五毒”以后，人民政府为了照顾私营企业淡季的生产中的困难，对私营企业大力进行扶植。三月份，国营花纱、百货、工业器材等十四个公司及人民银行上海分行，以加工、定货、收购、贷款的方式，扶植五千多户私营工厂进行生产。四月份上半月，国营贸易部门及人民银行上海分行，又以这些方式，扶植了三十四个主要行业共三千多户私营工厂进行生产。在“三反”“五反”以后，人民政府对于私营企业的扶植是有特殊意义的：一方面，国营贸易部门接受“三反”的经验教训，在委托加工和定货时初步实行了认真调查研究的工作方法，初步贯彻了依靠工人阶级、走群众路线的方针；另一面，资本家在“五反”运动中，真正看见了工人阶级的力量，认识到必须服从国营经济的领导才有发展的前途。因此，在交易中就出现了正常的公私关系。比如国营百货公司委托私营厂商加工或向私营厂商定货，首先依靠私营厂商的职工比较确实地核算了各种商品的成本，然后根据资方的自愿，签订了比较合理的合约：一、约定交货日期不得变更。如因特殊原因需要提前或延期交货时，必须事前申请并经委托加工和定货的方面同意。二、无故延迟交货日期者，每延迟一天，须缴纳当期货款总额百分之一的违约金。三、定货品质和成交时样品要完全相符，不偷工减料，不掺杂掺次；否则，除赔偿一切损失外，并愿受国法制裁。四、成本价格必须正确合理，如有有意蒙混、投机取巧、追求暴利等不法行为，一经查出，按第三条同样处理。为了保证合约的执行，由基层工会作监证人。实行了这些措施，就把违法资本家投机取巧、谋取暴利的可能性大大减少了。
    正常的公私关系的建立，正在教育和推动着上海的资本家：他们要求得合法的利润，必须依靠工人阶级改进经营管理。
    “三反”“五反”以后，人民政府对于私营企业的扶植，已经更有效地发挥了国营经济的领导作用。这必然会促使私营企业向着正当的途径发展。
    违法资本家开始端正经营作风
    “五反”运动对于违法资本家是最有力的教育。他们经过人民群众帮助消除“五毒”，经过职工督促和协助改进经营管理并努力提高生产，经过人民政府大力扶植，并初步建立正常的公私关系以后，许多人开始认识：只要服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，老老实实做一个正当工商业者，自然有光明的前途。因此，许多厂店的资方已经安心经营业务。如永昌棉织厂，过去因有许多顾虑，逃避了机器十六部，现在决定全部拿回厂中。善裕泰绒线号也因有顾虑逃避了大批羊毛，现在已拍电报到外埠把羊毛收回。新大陆轮船公司为了搞好今后的业务，决定修好船舶，提高航运性能，减低航运成本。同时，许多厂店开始端正经营作风。例如华福工业原料行，过去一贯以投机取巧营生，以致原料不买，机器生锈。现在，老板决定收回债帐，帐外资产立即入帐；工厂添置帮浦、烘炉设备；停止出售一切不合规格的货品，单位份量不足的包装原料一概补足，假货、劣货一律取消。丽华药房决定把十几箱失效的配尼西林、沉淀的钙针及变质的六○六针剂停止出售。庄子记五金号过去经常把旧铁管冒充新货出售；现在出售这类货色时，先把实际情况向顾客说明，贬价出售。许多商店经职工和老板合理计算成本后，减低了商品售价。泰康公司已把各类饼干的售价平均降低了百分之十左右。有些罐头食品的价格照码削减了四成。丽华药房过去售出配尼西林十二片价值三万六千元，现减为二万五千元。庄子记五金号已把五分之四的白铁管每尺售价由一万五千元降为一万二千元。商品虽然减削了价格，老板仍然有利可图。以大中华电器公司所售的火表和千层纸而论，这两种商品的售价虽已分别降低百分之二十及百分之四十，但每售一只火表仍可赚四万元，每售一磅千层纸也能获得百分之十七左右的利润。同昌车行的情况也是一样，每部燕子牌脚踏车的售价虽然已由一百九十六万元降低到一百五十二万元，利润仍有二成。

    上海的“五反”运动，正从各方面改造着私营工商业。上海是中国产业最集中的地方，是中国民族资产阶级最集中的地方，同时也是百余年来受买办和官僚资本毒害最深的地方。今天“五反”运动对于上海的私营工商业的改造，对于全国的新民主主义经济建设有很大的意义。
