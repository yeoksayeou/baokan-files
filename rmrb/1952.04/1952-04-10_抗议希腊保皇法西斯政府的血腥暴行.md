    Protesting the Bloody Atrocities of the Greek Royalist Fascist Government

    Ignoring the angry protests of the Greek people and progressive people all over the world, the Greek Royalist Fascist government, under the direction of the US imperialists, brazenly murdered the Greek peace and democracy fighter, member of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, Beloyannis, and his three comrades. This crime of the US imperialists and the Greek reactionaries has once again exposed them as the most hateful enemies of the Greek people.

    The purpose of the US imperialists and the Greek reactionary government in killing Beloyannis and other Greek patriotic fighters is to use this terrifying and bloody method to destroy the democratic forces in Greece, in order to suppress the Greek people's patriotic movement of resistance against the enslavement of US imperialism and the royalist fascist tyranny. In order to step up preparations for a war of aggression, US imperialism has dragged Greece into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and is turning Greece into a bridgehead for its aggression on the Mediterranean coast. To facilitate the unbridled implementation of its war policy in Greece, US imperialism has ordered the Greek reactionary government to implement fascist terror rule over the Greek people who demand bread and freedom, illegally detaining countless Greek patriotic fighters who are fighting for the democratic freedom of their motherland in concentration camps set up throughout Greece, arbitrarily persecuting and slaughtering them.

    But the patriotic fighters of Greece will never yield, and the Greek people's will to love peace and demand freedom cannot be confined by the reactionaries' prisons or concentration camps. Beloyannis and other patriotic fighters will forever live in the hearts of the Greek people, and their just cause of resisting imperialism and the Greek reactionaries will be inherited by tens of thousands of Greek patriots. It is certain that the final victory will not belong to the heinous, brutal, and reactionary imperialists and their running dogs, but to the heroic and unyielding Greek people who persevere in their struggle.

    抗议希腊保皇法西斯政府的血腥暴行
    希腊保皇法西斯政府不顾希腊人民和全世界进步人士的愤怒抗议，在美帝国主义者的指使之下，悍然杀害了希腊和平民主战士、希腊共产党中央委员贝劳扬尼斯和他的三个同志。美帝国主义和希腊反动派的这种罪行，又一次暴露了他们是希腊人民最可恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义和希腊反动政府杀害贝劳扬尼斯等希腊爱国志士的目的，是想用这种恐怖的血腥手段，来摧残希腊的民主力量，以便镇压希腊人民反抗美帝国主义的奴役和保皇法西斯暴政的爱国运动。为了加紧准备侵略战争，美帝国主义已将希腊拖入了北大西洋侵略集团，并正在把希腊变成它在地中海畔实行侵略的桥头堡垒。为便于在希腊放手地推行它的战争政策，美帝国主义又命令希腊反动政府对要求面包和自由的希腊人民实行法西斯恐怖统治，将无数为祖国的民主自由而奋斗的希腊爱国志士，非法拘禁在遍设于希腊各地的集中营里，任意加以迫害和屠杀。
    但是希腊的爱国志士是永远不会屈服的，希腊人民热爱和平、要求自由的意志也不是反动派的牢狱或集中营所能禁锢的。贝劳扬尼斯等爱国志士将永远活在希腊人民的心里，他们反抗帝国主义和希腊反动派的正义事业，将会为成千成万的希腊爱国人民所继承。可以确信，获得最后胜利的，一定不是穷凶极恶、残暴成性的帝国主义反动派和它的走狗，而是英勇不屈、坚持斗争的希腊人民。
