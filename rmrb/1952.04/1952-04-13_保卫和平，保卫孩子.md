Defend Peace, Defend the Children
YU Lulin, Director of the Beihai Experimental Nursery in Beijing

The International Conference for the Defence of Children has opened in Vienna. Representatives from all over the world, with the hearts of millions of loving mothers, are discussing how to protect the safety and happiness of children all over the world. Looking at the group of children around me, I have many things to tell the mothers and fathers of the world.

Now is the beautiful spring season, and our children have all put on light and comfortable jackets, laughing, jumping, and cheering the arrival of spring.

In this warm weather, to make the children healthier, we try to let them get more exposure to sunlight and fresh air. Every day, they do morning exercises outdoors, play games, climb mountains, and row boats. Each round little face is tanned red and black, making them particularly lovely. The teachers take them to the parks and the suburbs to observe how spring arrives, how the tender leaves of the grass sprout from the soil, how the ice on the river melts, and whether the insects that overwinter in the ground have woken up. The children will no longer feel the cold and dryness of winter. Although they miss ice skating and building snowmen a little, they love the peace, tranquility, and warmth of spring even more.

Our nursery has been established for a full three years now. Three years is not a long time, but we have raised hundreds of young children. We have taken on the duties of hundreds of mothers, allowing them to work peacefully with peace of mind. Their children are as warm here as they are by their mothers' sides. We have raised the small children and restored the health of the weak children. Today, all the children are so happy and healthy. They live, learn, and grow without worry. Not a single child thinks that they will have any misfortune or that anyone will bully them.

But it hasn't always been this way. Nor are all the children in the world like this. In our nursery, many children were born in times of war. At the beginning of their young lives, they suffered from the disasters of the old society, the terror and damage of war. Dongdong is one such child. He came with a body full of diseases: lung disease, rickets, skin diseases, and extreme malnutrition. We carefully treated him and gave him adequate nutrition. Now, he has recovered his health, and his little face is as red as all the healthy children's. How can we allow American imperialism and its running dogs to harm a child like this again?

We think of the children of Korea, who are ravaged by the American imperialist war of aggression. Some are sleeping in the fields; some are so hungry that they are grabbing their mothers' dry nipples and wailing; some, when they are laughing in groups, are suddenly blown to pieces by an American bomb; some are even having their tongues cut off, their hands and feet chopped off, and even their intestines cut open by American beasts for pleasure. Recently, the American aggressors have also used bacteriological weapons in an attempt to massacre children in batches. We don't even dare to think about such things, but it is an existing reality. Moreover, this kind of thing is still threatening the entire world—all the children of Asia, the children of Europe, the children of the Americas, are threatened by the war policies of American imperialism.

The more I come into contact with children, the more I think about the great significance of defending world peace today.

Not only do we adults understand this, but our children also know the meaning of peace to them.

A volunteer soldier came to visit our nursery. He praised the good air and sunshine in the children's bedroom. Six-year-old Teta immediately said to him, "This is because you are fighting in the front and protecting us."

However, there are still many things that the young minds of children cannot understand. Once, when several children were writing letters to the volunteer uncles, they suddenly asked, "What do American devils look like? Do they have very long hair all over their bodies?" Such questions are not ridiculous, because in the children's imagination, human beings are peace-loving and child-loving, just like their mothers and aunts. They can't imagine that a human-shaped thing would pick up a child with a bayonet and laugh, or burn a mother and child alive. Therefore, they can only imagine: these things must not be human, but wild beasts covered with hair. Perhaps they are still blaming us with suspicion: a dog that bites people will be tied up with iron chains, why don't people tie up American imperialism, this mad beast?

The children's imagination and blame are right. Today's imperialist aggressors are indeed no longer human, and should be tied with iron chains—mothers and fathers all over the world, for the sake of children, use the long chain of our will to defend world peace, and tie up the war-mongers!

    保卫和平，保卫孩子
    北京北海实验托儿所所长  于陆琳
    国际保卫儿童大会在维也纳开幕了。来自世界各国的代表，带着亿万颗慈母的心，在讨论着保卫全世界孩子们的安全和幸福。看看身边的一群孩子，我有许多话要告诉全世界的母亲们和父亲们。
    现在正是美丽的春天，我们的孩子都换上了轻便舒适的夹衣，笑着，跳着，欢呼春天的到来。
    在这温暖的气候里，为了使孩子们更健康，我们尽量让孩子们多接触阳光和新鲜空气。他们天天在户外做晨操，做游戏，爬山，划船。一个个圆圆的小脸晒得又红又黑，格外显得可爱。教养员们带着他们在公园里，在郊外，观察春天是怎样到来的，小草的嫩叶怎样从泥土里钻出来，河里的冰层是怎样溶化的，在地里过冬的虫子睡醒了没有。孩子们再也不会感到冬天的寒冷和枯燥了。虽然他们有点怀念溜冰和堆雪人，但他们更爱春天的和平、恬静和温暖。
    我们的托儿所从成立到现在，整整三年了。三年的时间不很长，但我们抚育了上百的幼儿。我们代替了上百母亲的职务，使她们能够安心地去从事和平劳动。她们的孩子在这儿像在母亲身边一样温暖。我们把小的孩子带大，把体弱的孩子恢复了健康。在今天看来，所有的孩子都是那么快乐和健壮。他们无忧无愁地生活着，学习着，成长着。没有一个孩子会想到他们将会有什么不幸，将会有什么人来欺负他们。
    但并不是从来就是这样的。也不是全世界所有的孩子都是这样的。在我们的托儿所里，有很多孩子是在战争的日子里出生的。他们幼小的生命的开头，曾受过旧社会的灾害，受过战争的恐吓和损伤。冬冬就是这样的孩子里面的一个。他带来了满身的疾病：肺病、软骨病、皮肤病和极度的营养不良。我们细心地治疗他，给他充足的营养。现在，他恢复健康了，小脸和所有健康的孩子一样发红。像这样的孩子，我们怎能允许美帝国主义和他的走狗们再来加害于他呢？
    我们想到朝鲜的孩子，他们被美帝国主义的侵略战争蹂躏着。有的露宿在野地里；有的饿得抓住妈妈的发干的奶头在嚎啕大哭；有的，当他们成群地在欢笑的时候，突然被一枚美国炸弹炸得血肉横飞；有的还被美国兽兵割掉舌头、砍去手脚、甚至被挖肠剖肚来取乐。最近，美国侵略者还使用了细菌武器，企图成批成批地屠杀孩子们。这种事情使我们想都不敢想，然而它是存在着的现实。而且，这种事情还在威胁着整个世界——所有亚洲的孩子，欧洲的孩子，美洲的孩子，都受着美帝国主义战争政策的威胁。
    和孩子们接触得越多，我就越想到今天保卫世界和平的重大意义。
    不独我们成年人懂得这一点，我们的孩子们也知道和平对他们的意义。
    一位志愿军同志到我们托儿所来参观。他满口称赞孩子们的卧室的空气好，阳光好。六岁的铁塔立刻对他说：“这是你们在前方打仗，给我们保卫着的。”
    但是，对于孩子们的幼小的心灵，还有许多事情不能理解。有一次，有几个孩子在给志愿军叔叔写信时，忽然问：“美国鬼子长的什么样子？是不是他们满身长着很长的毛？”这样的问题并不是可笑的，因为孩子们想像中的人类是爱和平、爱孩子的，都像他们的母亲和阿姨一样。他们想像不出一种人形的东西会用刺刀把孩子挑起来哈哈大笑，或是把母亲和孩子活活地用火烧死。所以，他们只能想像：这些东西一定不是人，而是身上长满了毛的野兽。也许他们还在用怀疑的心情责备我们：一只咬人的狗会用铁链子把它拴住，为什么人们不把美帝国主义这只疯狂的野兽拴住呢？
    孩子们的想像和责备都是对的。今天的帝国主义侵略者的确已经不是人了，应该用铁链子把它拴住——全世界的母亲们和父亲们，为了孩子，用我们保卫世界和平的意志的长链，把战争贩子们拴住吧！
