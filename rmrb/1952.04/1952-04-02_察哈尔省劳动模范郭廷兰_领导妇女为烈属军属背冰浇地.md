Charhar Province Labor Model Guo Tinglan
Leads Women in Carrying Ice to Irrigate Fields for Families of Martyrs and Soldiers

Guo Tinglan, a female labor model from Baita Temple Village, Zhuolu County, who attended the Charhar Province Labor Model Representative Conference, did not forget the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs even when she was ill. As soon as she recovered, she immediately convened a women's congress in the village. She repeatedly explained to the women that doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs was the same as resisting America and aiding Korea. Under Guo Tinglan's call, the women of the village planned to clean up 42 mu of land belonging to seven households, including the family of martyr Xue Jinzhen and the families of soldiers Jia Youcai and Zhu Wanyin, before March 15; to collect 300 loads of kang soil and manure by March 20, and to carry ice to irrigate 8 mu of land; and to carry out pest control once on all land belonging to families of martyrs and soldiers by the end of March. Thanks to Guo Tinglan's active leadership, even elderly women like Tian Shulin and Wu Ruilan collected 30 loads of kang soil and manure for the families of martyrs and soldiers. They said as they worked: "Other people's sons are fighting American devils at the front, it's only right that we help the families of soldiers with a few workdays!" The enthusiasm of the other women was also high. Everyone was determined to do a good job for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Liu Yuliang

    察哈尔省劳动模范郭廷兰
    领导妇女为烈属军属背冰浇地
    出席察哈尔省劳动模范代表会议的涿鹿县白塔寺村女劳动模范郭廷兰，在病中也不忘拥军优属的工作。她的病刚好，立刻就召开全村妇女大会。她给妇女们反复地讲解了做好拥军优属工作就是抗美援朝的道理。在郭廷兰的号召下，全村妇女们计划给烈属薛进珍、军属贾有财、朱万银等七户的四十二亩地，在三月十五日前收拾净；在三月二十日前砸出炕土块粪三百担，并背冰浇地八亩；在三月底，凡是烈军属的地都普遍除虫一次。由于郭廷兰的积极带头，连老婆婆田树林、吴瑞兰，也为烈军属砸出炕土块粪三十担。她俩并一面作一面说：“人家儿子在前方打美国鬼子，咱们帮军属几个工，太应该啦！”其他妇女们的情绪也高涨。大家都决心把烈军属的活干好。　刘玉良
