Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 24th, after the American aggressors' shameless conspiracy to use the "International Committee of the Red Cross" and the United Nations "World Health Organization" and other subservient tools to probe the effects of germ warfare in northern Korea was exposed, Ridgway repeatedly dispatched large numbers of airborne spies to our rear to carry out intelligence gathering activities.

The four Koreans, Jin Zhonghuan, Che Daoji, Jin Shuyu, and Jin Genzhi, were among a group of airborne spies recently captured. All four of them had been trained at a training class set up by the Liaison Department of the U.S. Far East Command's intelligence agency stationed in Korea; the first two spies were trained in the intelligence section, and the latter two were trained in the radio section. Jin Zhonghuan and Che Daoji had also received special training in collecting information on epidemics before being dispatched. This course included the types of epidemics, the scope of their prevalence, the mortality rate, disease vectors, and so on. The four of them were directly dispatched by an American lieutenant, and before they set off, the Americans gave them an injection of an unknown vaccine. The American lieutenant instructed them that after arriving at their destination, they should investigate and report on the infectious disease situation in Korea as soon as possible, and other military intelligence could be reported later.

These four airborne spies carried many medical supplies. These included seven bottles of oil-based penicillin that can treat meningitis, one bottle of aureomycin that specifically treats typhus, and various other powders, pills, and ointments of unspecified names, as well as syringes and first-aid kits. In addition, the Americans equipped them with transmitters and receivers, motors, cameras, American-style pistols, rifles, Korean People's Army uniforms and shoulder patches, as well as various forged documents, forged Korean Democratic Youth League membership cards, 1:250,000 military maps, and a large amount of Korean currency. They parachuted from a C-47 American transport plane over a certain area in northern Korea near Seoul at 10:00 PM on the night of April 10th and were all captured by a unit of our Volunteer Army before noon on April 11th.

    美国侵略者一再妄图刺探其细菌战效果
    志愿军又捕获四名美军空降特务
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社二十四日消息：美国侵略者企图利用“红十字国际委员会”和联合国“世界卫生组织”等御用工具到朝鲜北部刺探细菌战效果的无耻阴谋被揭穿以后，李奇微一再派遣大批空降特务到我后方来进行搜集情报的活动。
    朝鲜人金忠焕、车道吉、金淑玉和金根植等四个人，就是在最近又被捕获的一批空降特务。他们四个人曾在美国远东司令部特务机关驻朝鲜的联络部所设的一个训练班受过训练；前两名特务在情报科受训，后两名在无线电科受训。金忠焕和车道吉二人在被派遣以前还专门受了搜集疫情情报课程的训练。这项课程包括疫病种类、流行范围、死亡率、疾病媒介物等等。他们四个人由一名美军中尉直接派遣，出发以前美国人还曾给他们打了一种不知名的防疫针。该美军中尉曾指令他们：到达目的地以后应尽速调查，并报告朝鲜传染病情况，其他军事情报可稍后再报。
    这四名空降特务来时携带了许多医药用品。其中包括可以治脑膜炎的油质盘尼西林七瓶、专治斑疹伤寒的金霉素一瓶，和其他未标注名称的药粉药丸药膏等多种，并有注射器、急救包等。此外，美国人还给他们配备了收发报机、马达、照相机、美式手枪、步枪、朝鲜人民军的制服和肩章以及各种伪造的证件、伪造的朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员证、二十五万分之一的军用地图和大量的朝鲜币。他们是四月十日夜十时在汉城附近乘一架四七型美国运输机至朝鲜北部某地上空降落，在四月十一日中午以前即被我志愿军某部全部捕获。
