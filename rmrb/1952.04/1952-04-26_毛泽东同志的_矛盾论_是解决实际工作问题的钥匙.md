Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" is the Key to Solving Practical Work Problems
Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

After reading "On Practice," I have also read another profound philosophical work by Comrade Mao Zedong – "On Contradiction." These two profound philosophical works have made significant contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory and have significant guiding significance for theoretical and practical work. From this, we can see how Comrade Mao Zedong was good at summarizing the rich experiences of the Chinese revolution and, based on the vivid life of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, explaining the core issues of Marxist-Leninist philosophy in a simple and understandable way.

I. Understanding the Consolidation of the Working Class's Leadership from the Analysis of Various Contradictions at Home and Abroad

"On Contradiction" tells us: "Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be the principal one, and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one which plays the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the one which has gained the dominant position." It also states: "When the principal aspect which has gained the dominant position changes, the nature of a thing changes accordingly." According to this argument, analyzing the various contradictions between New China and Old China will reveal that the qualitative difference between New China and Old China mainly lies in the fact that Old China was under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, with reactionary rule standing as the principal aspect of the contradiction in a dominant position. New China, on the other hand, has the formerly oppressed masses as masters of the country, with the masses suppressing the former oppressors; in this regard, the masses stand as the principal aspect of the contradiction in a dominant position. However, the masses include various revolutionary classes, and the roles these revolutionary classes play in the revolution are not entirely the same. Some are leading classes, and some are led classes. In the New Democratic Revolution and the Old Democratic Revolution, the leading classes are different. When we use "On Contradiction" as a weapon to analyze the issue of revolutionary leadership, we will surely discover that the qualitative difference between the New Democratic Revolution and the Old Democratic Revolution mainly lies in the fact that the former is led by the working class, while the latter is led by the bourgeoisie. From this, it can be seen that the nature of the revolution differs depending on which principal aspect of the contradiction is in a decisive position. Therefore, the leadership of the working class is the essence and fundamental symbol of New Democracy. Thus, in the New Democratic Revolution, we must always pay close attention to developing and enhancing the leadership strength of the working class and consolidating the leadership of the working class in all aspects, at any time or on any battlefront. Neglecting this point is neglecting the most fundamental thing. If the leadership of the working class is usurped by the bourgeoisie, then the principal aspect of the contradiction in the revolution, which is in a decisive position, will change. In the era of imperialism and the world proletarian revolution, in colonies and semi-colonies, the bourgeoisie cannot lead the democratic revolution to victory. If we are usurped of our leadership by the bourgeoisie, we will inevitably ruin the prospects of the revolution, allow imperialism and other reactionary forces to regain the upper hand, and return the masses to a position of slavery. The situation in Yugoslavia is such an example.

Observing and proving from various movements in modern Chinese history, the working class is fully capable of leading the revolution to the end, and only it can lead the revolution to the end. However, whether the working class can actually consolidate its leadership depends on the working class itself, that is, on the internal factors of the working class. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "In 1927, the Chinese big bourgeoisie defeated the proletariat through the operation of opportunism within the Chinese proletariat (within the Chinese Communist Party). When we liquidated this opportunism, the Chinese revolution developed anew. Later, the Chinese revolution suffered severe blows from the enemy because adventurism arose within our Party. When we liquidated this adventurism, our cause developed anew." It is precisely because of the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong that the Chinese working class and its party were able to guide the Chinese revolution to victory. In today's China after the victory of the revolution, the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements are effective through the impurity of the personnel in our organizations. To repel the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, we can only rely on the great strength of the Chinese working class and all conscious masses under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

From this, it can be seen that to consolidate and enhance the leadership of the working class, we must, in our practical work, pay attention to studying Marxism-Leninism at all times, constantly improve our level of consciousness, and use this to educate cadres, party members, and the masses. We must correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to overcome all unhealthy tendencies within the Party and eliminate all reflections of non-proletarian ideologies within the Party. We must at any time remove alien elements and incurable degenerates who have infiltrated the Party, and maintain the Party's organizational purity and consolidation.

From this, it can also be seen that to consolidate and enhance the leadership of the working class, we must also pay close attention to mobilizing, organizing, and educating the broad masses of workers and staff, drawing a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and constantly improving the consciousness and organization of the working class. At the same time, we must attract and unite the broad masses of peasants and other working people to our side, so that they accept the leadership and influence of the working class and free themselves from feudal remnants and bourgeois influences.

Only in this way can the working class always maintain its leading position, promote the smooth development of our country's revolutionary and construction cause, and promote the smooth transition of our country's revolution from New Democracy to Socialism.

II. Grasping the Central Link in Work is the Main Method for Solving Problems

"On Contradiction" tells us: "In the development of a complex thing, there are many contradictions, one of which is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions." "In any process of development, at any stage, there is only one principal contradiction which plays the leading role."

According to Comrade Mao Zedong's argument, we can understand that in practical work, we must grasp the principal contradiction and strive to resolve the principal contradiction. Once the principal contradiction is resolved, the other contradictions will change accordingly, and another contradiction will become the principal one. What is the principal contradiction in practical work? That is what we usually call the "central link." As long as we can grasp the central link in work, we can drive the entire chain. In order to concentrate our efforts on resolving the principal contradiction, we can only have one center at a time, not several centers. This is true from the overall perspective of the work, and it is also true from the local perspective of the work.

Even in the work of a factory, it is necessary, in various periods, to focus on resolving the main contradictions and grasping the central link, according to the situation and conditions at that time. After liberation, the overall goal of factory work was to improve production. Under this overall goal, many tasks need to be carried out, that is, many contradictions need to be resolved. However, the first thing to be resolved is the central task, that is, the principal contradiction. At the beginning of liberation, the main contradiction in the factory was the contradiction between "handing over" and "taking over," and the central task was taking over. Taking over was to transform the old bureaucratic capital enterprises into new enterprises with a socialist nature. Resolving this contradiction was a revolution in the relations of production, which was the basis and starting point for our enterprise management work. Only by taking over well can we quickly restore production and prevent it from being destroyed or stagnated. When resolving this contradiction, the method of keeping the old personnel in their original positions and salaries was adopted. After the contradiction between "handing over" and "taking over" was resolved and production was restored, the contradiction between the leadership of the working class and the old system, old personnel, and old style became the main contradiction, so democratic reform became the central task. After the principal contradiction was resolved by adopting the method of democratic reform, if the contradiction between the socialist nature of the enterprise and the capitalist viewpoints in business management and technical guidance has not been properly resolved, it may become the principal contradiction, and then production reform may become the central task. After these problems are resolved, the contradiction between advanced and backward becomes the main contradiction, and rationalization proposals and production competitions become the central tasks.

As mentioned above, when the principal contradiction in each stage of the development of things is resolved, the other contradictions of things are bound to change. Under certain conditions, when resolving the principal contradiction, one or several secondary contradictions can be resolved simultaneously or partially resolved. Then, in carrying out various tasks, we can combine certain tasks with the central task. For example, in the process of democratic reform, we can combine it with rectifying trade unions and relations, and we can also combine it with some production reforms. For example, under certain conditions, production reform may not become a central task alone, but it can still be combined with democratic reform and production competition to seek appropriate solutions.

The combination of various tasks is very important. But we must understand that due to different conditions, each contradiction has its own particularity in its interconnection, so the solution should also be different.

Furthermore, since various contradictions cannot be separated from the overall situation of things, we can understand that in the factory, various contradictions are related to production. The overall situation of various contradictions in factory work is to overcome obstacles in production, improve production, and continuously improve labor productivity. Leaving this overall situation, that is, leaving production, everything will lose its meaning. Grasping the center means grasping the central link of each stage of the overall production situation, and at the same time, this overall situation, in addition to this central link, also has other related links that must be paid attention to. Therefore, grasping the central link does not mean that we should completely ignore other related links that must be paid attention to, but also take care of other related links that must be paid attention to; and we must always pay attention to the links that were not originally central but may become central in the development process, so as to promote the transition from one central link to another. This is also grasping the overall situation, that is, grasping the interconnection of various contradictions. Only by grasping the overall situation can we grasp the center well, and only by grasping the center can we promote the overall situation well. Therefore, the so-called "single fight" approach in practical work is wrong.

III. We Must Pay Attention to New Things and New Problems in Order to Grasp the Changes in Contradictions

In complex things, the principal contradiction is not easy to grasp. Especially when the previous principal contradiction has not been completely resolved, the trend of development and change of things will not be very obvious. Therefore, in practical work, we must pay close attention to the development of the situation. When a new contradiction, especially a new principal contradiction, is not very obvious, we must see it, grasp it, so as to prepare conditions for the next stage of work in the previous stage, and not create difficulties for the next stage.

"On Contradiction" inspires us in this way: "The movement of everything assumes two states, that of relative rest and that of conspicuous change. Both states of motion are caused by the struggle between the two mutually contradictory elements contained in a thing. When the thing is in the first state of motion, it undergoes only quantitative and not qualitative change and consequently presents the outward appearance of being at rest. When the thing is in the second state of motion, the quantitative change in the first state has already reached a breaking point, causing the dissolution of the thing as an entity and thereupon giving rise to a qualitative change, and consequently presents the outward appearance of conspicuous change." Therefore, in practical work, we must be good at distinguishing these changes, that is, we must not only see the resolution of the current contradiction, but also be good at recognizing the dissolution of the entity and recognizing the new problems arising in the development of work.

For example, mutual aid organizations in agricultural production were, during the war, to overcome the difficulties in production at that time (war environment, lack of manpower and animal power). At that time, production and war were two contradictory aspects. But when the war ended and the lack of manpower and animal power caused by the war was also substantially resolved, the original main contradiction within the mutual aid group was basically resolved, and another contradiction that was once relatively static – the contradiction between the direction of cooperation led by the working class and the spontaneous trend of small peasant producers – became prominent. From the war period to the period after the end of the war, the form of the mutual aid group has not changed, but its contradiction has undergone a certain change. During the war, the mutual aid group was mainly a special unity of opposites between production and war. After the end of the war, the mutual aid group was mainly a special unity of opposites between collective labor and private property, that is, a special unity of opposites between the direction of cooperation led by the working class and the spontaneous trend of small peasant producers. Failure to pay attention to this change will not be able to improve the leadership of the mutual aid group, will not be able to overcome the tendency of mutual aid groups to disintegrate after the end of the war, and will not be able to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Although the shortage of manpower and animal power of the peasants was substantially resolved after the end of the war, mutual aid and cooperation are still needed by the peasants, because the land reform and domestic unity and peace greatly increased the needs of the peasants. Therefore, rapidly developing production to meet the needs is the demand of the peasants, and mutual aid and cooperation in production can just rapidly develop production to meet such demands of the peasants. The way to solve this problem is to strengthen the leadership of the working class, and gradually (not rudely) improve the mutual aid group according to the principles of voluntary and mutual benefit of the peasants, so that the cooperative factors become the main aspect of the contradiction and fully display its superiority to attract the peasant masses to it. Therefore, the agricultural production cooperative should be a form of advancement, that is, a transitional form towards agricultural collectivization and modernization.

For example, after the land reform has been completed and the feudal economic base has been completely destroyed, the main problem of rural work is to develop production, and the main contradiction is the contradiction between developing production and backward production. In resolving this contradiction, there are two paths – the contradiction between the direction of cooperation and the spontaneous trend of peasants. But there is another contradiction that is also very important, that is, the contradiction between the new economic base and the remaining feudal superstructure. In the countryside, the main feudal superstructure – the power of the old ruling class – has been overthrown, followed by land reform – that is, the destruction of the feudal economic base, but the feudal remnants in people's spiritual life are after all more stubborn than the feudal remnants in economic life; and the peasant's small-scale production economy also affects the existence of the patriarchal system and the emergence of bureaucracy. Precisely because of this, women's struggle against the feudal marriage system has encountered great resistance and suffered no small sacrifices. The remaining feudal superstructure (feudal marriage system, family relations, customs, moral concepts, etc.) has a negative counter-effect on the new economic base. Therefore, in the vast countryside, striving to support the newly born superstructure (new marriage relations, democratic and harmonious families, etc.), publicizing these new models, and developing cultural, scientific, and educational undertakings is a task that cannot be ignored.

Failure to grasp these new changes and new problems will lead to detours and losses in work.

IV. We Must Treat Contradictions Specifically in Order to Solve Problems Correctly

"On Contradiction" tells us: "Each form of motion contains its own particular contradiction. Of the many forms of motion, each has its own particular essence. What is particular in a thing constitutes the particular essence which distinguishes this thing from other things. All causes of motion of things are internal to the thing itself. All contradictions are internal to a thing, i.e., are intrinsic to it." Therefore, for each type of work and each type of struggle, we must study its special contradictions and adopt different work methods or forms of struggle. The workers' movement, the peasants' movement, the students' movement, the women's movement... all have their special features according to their different natures and conditions. The struggle against imperialism, the struggle against the landlord class, the struggle against the bourgeoisie... all have their special features according to their different natures and conditions. Therefore, blindly copying experiences or formulas is harmful. Therefore, in practical work, we must seek truth from facts and treat problems specifically. We cannot adopt the method of treating the landlord class to treat the bourgeoisie, and we cannot adopt the method of treating the bourgeoisie to treat the peasants.

For example, in New Democratic China, the socialist future and the reality of economic backwardness are a fundamental contradiction in nature. In order to solve this contradiction, we must on the one hand develop the socialist state-owned economy and the semi-socialist cooperative economy, and on the other hand give play to the positive role of urban and rural capitalism and allow the existence and development of capitalism that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. When the aspect of "economic backwardness" develops into its own opposite, and economic backwardness becomes economic prosperity, socialism is no longer a "future" but a reality. Therefore, in the current historical period, we must give play to its positive role in production for the bourgeoisie (this class has a progressive role in developing production, and many of them have "five poisons" and instinctively try to go beyond the scope of New Democracy), and we must also crack down on its reactionary aspects and ensure the leadership of the working class over it in politics and economy. This approach is suitable for the current situation in our country and suitable for the particularity of the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie in China today.

Taking the peasant class as an example, there are differences between workers and peasants, that is, there are contradictions. But the peasant class is different from the bourgeoisie. It is a working class. Under the leadership of the working class, it can go to socialism. The path taken by the Chinese peasants after the land reform is the path of "organization" instructed by Chairman Mao, which is the path of cooperatives. Agricultural mutual aid groups or cooperatives are "collective labor on the basis of private property." In this unity of opposites, private property and collective labor are two contradictory aspects. The leadership and assistance of the working class and the state, through its internal struggle, can gradually make collective labor the main aspect of the contradiction that gains the dominant position, and in coordination with the conditions of national industrial development, gradually promote the transformation of the "private property" of land and major means of production to its opposite side, and move towards the path of socialization, according to the peasants' own will. Therefore, to solve the contradiction between workers and peasants, we can only adopt the method of education and guidance, but we cannot adopt the method of treating the bourgeoisie.

"Different contradictions can only be resolved by different methods." In practical work, it is also a major issue to specifically study the forms of struggle according to the different nature of the struggle. The form of struggle of the "Five-Anti" campaign can only be used to deal with illegal bourgeois elements, and cannot be used to deal with workers and staff. The "Three-Anti" movement is suitable for state-owned enterprises, but not suitable for private enterprises. Failure to specifically study the forms of struggle will inevitably lead to political errors.

In practical work, we must specifically study our own working methods according to the different nature of the work. The working methods of the state power organs are not suitable for the work of trade unions, and the working methods of trade unions are not applicable to the party organizations. If we do not specifically study the working methods, we cannot make the two contradictory aspects of the worker and his work object have complete conditions for unity into a whole, and we cannot connect the two aspects, and the work will not be done well. It is precisely because we cannot often grasp the correct working methods that we often commit the mistakes of bureaucratism and subjectivism.

It can be seen that in practical work, we must seek truth from facts and treat problems specifically. And the so-called specificity is by no means based on the external signs of things, listing phenomena in a trivial way, the most important thing is to grasp the particularity of the contradiction.

Like "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" is a sharp weapon for us on various battle fronts. As Comrade Mao Zedong's elementary school student, I am working hard to learn. Of course, due to my own lack of theoretical foundation, the understanding is not very profound, but if the publication of this essay can help practitioners to increase their interest in the great philosophical work of "On Contradiction," and inspire them to study "On Contradiction" and summarize their own practical work experience to strengthen the practical work and play the basic content of "On Contradiction," it would be an extremely gratifying thing.

    毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”是解决实际工作问题的钥匙
    中华全国总工会秘书长  赖若愚
    继“实践论”之后，又读到了毛泽东同志的另一哲学著作——“矛盾论”。这两篇博大精深的哲学著作，在马克思列宁主义理论方面作了重大的贡献；对于理论工作和实际工作，具有重大的指导作用。从这里，我们可以看出毛泽东同志怎样善于把中国革命的丰富经验总结起来，并依据中国革命斗争的生动的生活，来深入浅出地解释马克思列宁主义哲学中的核心问题。
    一、从国内外各种矛盾的分析中去领会巩固工人阶级领导权的问题
    “矛盾论”告诉我们说：“矛盾着的两方面中，必有一方面是主要的，他方面是次要的。其主要的方面，即所谓矛盾起主导作用的方面。事物的性质，主要地是由取得支配地位的矛盾的主要方面所规定的。”又说：“取得支配地位的矛盾的主要方面起了变化，事物的性质也就随着起变化。”根据这一论点来分析新中国和旧中国的各种矛盾，就会了解：新中国和旧中国的质的区别，主要就在于：旧中国是在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治之下，反动统治是站在支配地位的矛盾的主要方面。而新中国是过去被压迫的人民大众做了国家的主人，人民大众镇压过去的压迫者，对此而说，人民大众是站在支配地位的矛盾的主要方面。但人民大众包括各个革命的阶级，这些革命阶级在革命中所起的作用，并不是完全一样的。他们有的是领导的阶级，有些是被领导的阶级。在新民主主义革命和旧民主主义革命中，领导的阶级各有不同。当我们用“矛盾论”作为思想武器来分析革命的领导问题时，就一定会发现：新民主主义革命和旧民主主义革命的质的区别，主要就在于：前者是工人阶级领导的，后者是资产阶级领导的。由此看来，处在决定地位的矛盾的主要方面不同，革命的性质也就不同。所以工人阶级的领导，是新民主主义的精髓和根本标志。从而在新民主主义革命中，不管在任何时候或任何斗争战线上，我们都必须十分注意发展和提高工人阶级的领导力量，从各方面来巩固工人阶级的领导。忽视了这一点，就是忽视了最根本的事情。如果工人阶级的领导权为资产阶级所篡夺，那么，处在决定地位的革命中的矛盾的主要方面就起了变化。而在帝国主义和世界无产阶级革命的时代，在殖民地和半殖民地中，资产阶级是不可能领导民主革命走向胜利的。我们如果被资产阶级篡夺了领导权，势必会断送了革命的前途，使帝国主义及其他反动势力又占了上风，使人民大众又回复到奴隶的地位。南斯拉夫的情况就是如此。
    从中国近代史各种运动来观察和证明，工人阶级是完全可以把革命领导到底的，而且只有它能够把革命领导到底。可是，工人阶级能不能实际上巩固自己的领导，又是决定于工人阶级自己，即决定于工人阶级的内在的因素的。正如毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”所说：“一九二七年中国大资产阶级战败了无产阶级，是通过中国无产阶级内部的（中国共产党内部的）机会主义而起作用的。当着我们清算了这种机会主义的时候，中国革命就重新发展了。后来，中国革命又受了敌人的严重的打击，是因为我们党内产生了冒险主义。当着我们清算了这种冒险主义的时候，我们的事业就又重新发展了。”正因为有了毛泽东同志的英明领导，中国工人阶级及其政党才引导中国革命得到胜利。在中国革命胜利后的今天，不法的资产阶级分子的进攻是通过机关工作人员的不纯而起作用的。我们要打退不法资产阶级分子的进攻，只有依靠在毛泽东同志英明领导下的我国工人阶级及一切觉悟群众的伟大力量。
    由此可见，要巩固和提高工人阶级的领导，我们就必须在实际工作中，时时刻刻注意学习马克思列宁主义，不断地提高自己的觉悟程度，并以此来教育干部、党员和群众。必须正确地运用批评和自我批评的武器，克服党内的一切不良倾向，肃清一切非无产阶级思想意识在党内的反映。必须随时把混入党内的异己分子和不可救药的蜕化分子清除出去，保持党在组织上的纯洁和巩固。
    由此可见，要巩固和提高工人阶级的领导，还必须十分注意发动、组织和教育广大的职工群众，划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，不断地提高工人阶级的自觉性和组织性。同时必须把广大的农民群众和其他劳动人民，吸引、团结到自己方面来，使他们接受工人阶级的领导和影响，摆脱封建残余和资产阶级的影响。
    只有这样，工人阶级才能始终使自己居于领导的地位，促使我国的革命和建设事业的顺利发展，促使我国革命由新民主主义逐步转向到社会主义的顺利发展。
    二、掌握工作中的中心环节是解决问题的主要方法
    “矛盾论”告诉我们：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”“过程发展的各个阶段中，只有一种主要的矛盾起着领导的作用。”
    根据毛泽东同志的这个论点，我们就可以领会：在实际工作中，必须抓住主要矛盾，并且努力解决主要的矛盾。解决了主要的矛盾，其它的矛盾就要随着变化，另一个矛盾就成为主要的。实际工作中的主要矛盾是什么呢？那就是我们平常所讲的“中心环节”。只要能抓住工作中的中心环节，就可以推动整个的链。为了集中力量解决主要矛盾，所以我们在一个时期内只能有一个中心，而不能有几个中心。这从工作的全局来看是如此，从工作的各个局部来看也是如此的。
    即使在一个工厂的工作中也是同样要在各个时期，根据当时的情况和条件，着重解决主要的矛盾，抓住中心的环节。解放后工厂工作的总目标是搞好生产。在这个总的目标之下，需要进行很多工作，也就是说要解决很多矛盾。而首先要解决的，却是中心工作，即主要矛盾。刚解放时，工厂的主要矛盾是“交”和“接”的矛盾，中心工作便是接管，接管是把官僚资本的旧企业变成社会主义性质的新企业，解决这个矛盾乃是生产关系的革命，为我们管理企业工作的基础和出发点。接管好了，才能迅速恢复生产，不使它遭受破坏或停顿起来。解决这一矛盾时，对于旧人员采取了原职原薪包下来的办法。在“交”和“接”的矛盾解决了之后，生产恢复了之后，工人阶级的领导和旧的制度、旧的人员、旧的作风之间的矛盾就成为主要的矛盾，所以民主改革就成为中心工作。采取民主改革的办法解决了这一主要矛盾之后，企业的社会主义性质和经营管理、技术指导等方面的资本主义观点——这一个矛盾如果还没有得到适当的解决，就有可能成为主要矛盾，那么生产改革也就可能成为中心工作。这些问题都解决了之后，先进和落后的矛盾就成为主要矛盾，合理化建议和生产竞赛运动就是中心工作。
    如上所说，当事物发展的每一阶段的主要矛盾得到解决之后，事物的其他矛盾也必然要起变化。在一定条件下，解决主要矛盾的时候，某一个或某几个次要的矛盾可以同时获得解决或获得部分解决。那么，我们在进行各种工作中，就可以把某些工作和中心工作结合起来进行了。比如民主改革过程中，可以结合进行整顿工会、整顿关系，也可以结合进行一些生产方面的改革。再如在一定的条件下，也许生产改革不单独成为一个中心工作，但仍可以结合民主改革和生产竞赛求得适当的解决。
    各种工作的结合是很重要的。但我们必须了解：由于条件的不同，各个矛盾在互相联结中都有它自己的特殊性，那么，解决的办法也就应该有所不同。
    再进一步说，各种矛盾，既然都不能脱离事物的总体，那么，我们可以体会：在工厂中，各种矛盾，都是和生产相联系的。工厂工作中的各个矛盾的总体，就是要克服生产中的障碍搞好生产，不断提高劳动生产率。离开了这个总体，即离开了生产，一切就都会失掉它的意义。掌握中心即是掌握生产这个总体的每一个阶段的中心环节，而在这同一时候，这个总体除了这个中心环节以外，又还有其他种种有关的环节，因此，掌握中心环节，不是说就应该完全不顾其他必须加以注意的有关的环节，而是还应该照顾其他必须加以注意的有关的环节；并且要随时注意那原来不是中心的环节而在发展过程中可能变成中心的环节，从而注意推进由一个中心环节到另一个中心环节。这也就是掌握全面，即掌握各个矛盾的相互联结。只有掌握了全面，才能很好地掌握中心，而掌握了中心才能很好地推动全面。所以，实际工作中所谓“单打一”的做法是不对的。
    三、必须注意新事物、新问题，才能掌握矛盾的变化
    在复杂的事物中，主要矛盾不是很容易就抓得住的。尤其是在前一个主要矛盾还没有完全解决的时候，事物发展变化的趋势还不会是很显著的。所以在实际工作中，要密切注意情况的发展。当一个新的矛盾，尤其是新的主要矛盾还不很显著的时候，就要看见它、抓住它，以便在工作的前一个阶段，就为后一个阶段准备条件，而不为后一个阶段制造困难。
    “矛盾论”这样启示我们：“无论什么事物的运动都采取两种状态，相对地静止的状态和显著地变动的状态。两种状态的运动都是由事物内部包含的两个矛盾着的因素互相斗争所引起的。当着事物的运动在第一种状态的时候，它只有数量的变化，没有性质的变化，所以显出好似静止的面貌。当着事物的运动在第二种状态的时候，它已由第一种状态中的数量的变化达到了某一个最高点，引起了统一物的分解，发生了性质的变化，所以显出显著地变化的面貌。”那么在实际工作中，就要善于辨别这些变动，即不但要看到当前矛盾的解决，更要善于认识统一物的分解，认识工作发展中产生的新问题。
    例如农业生产上的互助组织，在战争时期，是为了克服当时在生产中的困难（战争环境，人力、畜力不足）。在当时，生产和战争是矛盾的两个方面。但当战争结束，战争所造成的人力、畜力不足也得到相当的解决之后，互助组内部原来的主要矛盾基本解决了，而另一个曾经是相对静止的矛盾——工人阶级领导的合作化方向和农民小生产者的自发趋势之间的矛盾，就显著起来了。由战争时期到战争结束以后，互助组的形式上还没有变化，但它的矛盾却起了某种的变化。在战争时期，互助组主要是生产和战争的特殊的对立的统一。在战争结束之后，互助组主要是集体劳动和私有财产的特殊的对立的统一，即工人阶级领导的合作化的方向和农民小生产者的自发趋势之间的特殊的对立的统一。不注意这一变化，就不能很好地转变对于互助组的领导，就不能克服战争结束以后互助组的涣散趋势，就不能进一步巩固工农联盟。虽然战争结束以后，农民的人力和畜力的不足得到相当的解决，但是互助合作仍是农民所需要的，原因即是由于土地改革和国内的统一与和平，农民的需要大大增高，因此，迅速地发展生产以满足需要乃是农民的要求，而生产的互助合作恰恰能够迅速地发展生产以适应农民这样的要求。解决这一问题的道路，乃是加强工人阶级的领导，按照农民自愿和互利的原则，逐步地（而不是粗暴地）把互助组加以提高，使合作的因素成为矛盾的主要方面，并充分地显示它的优越性，来吸引农民群众倾向于它。所以农业生产合作社应该是一个前进的形式，也就是走向农业集体化、近代化的一个过渡形式。
    又如：当土地改革已经完成，封建的经济基础被彻底摧毁之后，农村工作的主要问题便是发展生产，主要矛盾是发展生产和生产落后的矛盾。在解决这一矛盾中间，又有两条道路——合作化的方向和农民自发趋势之间的矛盾。可是还有另外一种矛盾也是很重要的，即新的经济基础和残余的封建上层建筑之间的矛盾。在农村中，封建的主要上层建筑——旧统治阶级的政权已被推翻，随此而来的是土地改革——即封建的经济基础的摧毁，但是人们精神生活上的封建残余，毕竟要比经济生活上的封建残余来得更顽强一些；而农民的小生产经济，又影响到家长制的存在和官僚主义的产生。正因为这样，所以妇女群众在反对封建婚姻制度的斗争中，遇到了很大的反抗，也遭受到不小的牺牲。残余的封建上层建筑（封建的婚姻制度、家庭关系、风俗习惯、道德观念，等等），对于新的经济基础起着消极的反作用。因此，在广大农村中，努力扶植新生的上层建筑（新的婚姻关系、民主和睦家庭，等等），宣传这些新的典型，发展文化科学教育，是一个不可忽视的任务。
    抓不住这些新的变化、新的问题，工作就要走弯路，受损失。
    四、必须具体地对待矛盾，才能正确地解决问题
    “矛盾论”告诉我们：“各种物质运动形式中的矛盾，都带特殊性”。“对于物质的每一种运动形式，必须注意它和其他各种运动形式的共同点。但是，尤其重要的，成为我们认识事物的基础的东西，则是必须注意它的特殊点”。那么，对于每一种工作每一种斗争，都必须研究它的特殊的矛盾性，采取不同的工作方式或斗争形式。职工运动、农民运动、学生运动、妇女运动……都根据其不同的性质和条件，而有其特殊点。对帝国主义的斗争、对地主阶级的斗争、对资产阶级的斗争……都根据其不同的性质和条件，而有其特殊点。所以盲目地搬用经验或公式是有害的。因此，在实际工作中就要求实事求是地具体地对待问题。对待资产阶级不能采取对待地主阶级的办法，对待农民不能采取对待资产阶级的办法。
    例如在新民主主义的中国，社会主义前途和经济落后的现实情况，是一个根本性质的矛盾。为了解决这一矛盾，就必须一方面发展社会主义性质的国营经济和半社会主义性质的合作经济，一方面要发挥城乡资本主义的积极性，允许有利于国计民生的资本主义的存在和发展。当“经济落后”这一个矛盾的方面发展成为它自己的反对物，经济落后变成经济繁荣的时候，社会主义就不再是“前途”而是现实了。所以在现在的历史时期，我们对于资产阶级（这个阶级在发展生产上是有进步作用的，而他们当中有许多又具有“五毒”，本能地企图越出新民主主义的范围）必须发挥它的生产积极性，又必须打击它的反动的方面，在政治上、经济上确保工人阶级对它的领导。这种做法乃是适合我国现在的情况，适合于中国现在工人阶级和资产阶级矛盾的特殊性的。
    以农民阶级来说，工、农之间是有差别的，也就是有矛盾的。但是农民阶级和资产阶级不同，它是一个劳动的阶级，在工人阶级的领导之下，它可以走到社会主义去。土地改革以后中国农民所走的道路，是毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路，是合作社的道路。农业互助组或合作社是“私有财产基础上的集体劳动”。在这一个对立统一体里边，私有财产和集体劳动是矛盾着的两方面。工人阶级及国家的领导和帮助，透过它内在的斗争，就可以逐步地使集体劳动成为取得支配地位的矛盾的主要方面，配合国家工业发展的条件，根据农民的自愿，逐步地促使土地和主要的生产工具的“私有财产”向它的反对方面转化，走向社会化的道路。所以解决工农矛盾，只能采取教育、引导的方式，而不能采取对待资产阶级的办法。
    “不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”在实际工作中，根据不同性质的斗争，具体地研究斗争形式，也是一个重大问题。“五反”斗争的形式只能用来对待不法的资产阶级分子，不能用来对待职工群众。“三反”运动适合于国营企业，却不适合于私营企业。不具体地研究斗争形式，就不免要犯政治上的错误。
    在实际工作中，必须根据不同的工作性质，具体地研究自己的工作方式。政权机关的工作方式，不适合于工会工作，工会工作的方式也不适用于党的组织。如果不具体地研究工作方式，就不能使工作者和他的工作对象这两个矛盾的方面，具有统一为一个整体的完备的条件，就不能使两方面联结起来，工作就作不好。正因为我们不能常常掌握正确的工作方法，所以就常常犯官僚主义、事务主义的错误。
    可见在实际工作中，必须实事求是、具体地对待问题。而所谓具体，决不是根据事物的外部标志，琐碎地罗列现象，最主要的是抓住矛盾的特殊性。
    和“实践论”一样，毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”是我们在各个斗争战线上的一个锐利武器，作为毛泽东同志的小学生，我在努力学习。当然，由于自己理论基础的浅薄，领会是很不深刻的，但如果这篇习作发表，能帮助实际工作者提高对“矛盾论”这一伟大哲学著作的兴趣，触发他们来研究“矛盾论”，并总结自己的实际工作经验，来加强实际工作和发挥“矛盾论”的基本内容，那便是一件极其可喜的事情了。
