Commemorating the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of Comrade Stalin's Great Work "The Question of the Chinese Revolution"
陈 Boda

Comrade Stalin's great work, "The Question of the Chinese Revolution," was published on April 21, 1927. The situation at the time was characterized by a powerful surge in the Chinese workers' and peasants' movements, on the one hand, and the imperialist attack on the revolution in Shanghai and the massacre in Nanjing, with Chiang Kai-shek leading the Kuomintang right wing in openly surrendering to imperialism and betraying the revolution, on the other. As Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek's coup d'état signifies the withdrawal of the national bourgeoisie from the revolution." Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces formed new mobilizations, new divisions, and new combinations. The Chinese revolution was at a new historical turning point. This changing new situation further presented the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese proletariat, and the Chinese people with the question of where the Chinese revolution was heading.

In this great work of creative Marxism, Comrade Stalin, based on his analysis of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature of the Chinese revolution, summarized the experience of the Chinese revolution and pointed out that there were two paths of development for China.

Comrade Stalin said:

"There are two paths for the development of Chinese events:

Either the national bourgeoisie defeats the proletariat, colludes with imperialism, and jointly attacks the revolution in order to end the revolution by establishing capitalist rule.

Or the proletariat pushes the national bourgeoisie aside, consolidates its leadership, leads hundreds of millions of urban and rural masses to overcome the resistance of the national bourgeoisie, achieves complete victory in the bourgeois democratic revolution, and then gradually shifts it to the path of socialist revolution, with all the consequences arising therefrom.

One of the two must be chosen."

This is Comrade Stalin's extremely brilliant instruction.

According to Comrade Stalin's instructions, if the national bourgeoisie defeats the proletariat, it will lead to the failure of the Chinese revolution, leaving China under imperialist oppression and continuing to be a dependency of imperialism. This is one path. Conversely, if the Chinese proletariat can continue to consolidate its leadership and overcome the resistance of the national bourgeoisie, then China will achieve complete victory against imperialism and feudalism and gradually transition towards socialist development. This is another path.

That is, two paths: one is the path of failure for the Chinese revolution, and the other is the path of victory for the Chinese revolution.

Is there any "third path"? Comrade Stalin said: "One of the two must be chosen." There is no other "third path."

Comrade Stalin said: "The struggle between these two revolutionary paths is the characteristic of the Chinese revolution." The development of all historical events in China over the past twenty-five years has fully proven this brilliant conclusion of Comrade Stalin.

The question of which of the two paths is decided, as Comrade Stalin explained, is about the question of whether leadership belongs to the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. From the time the Chinese proletariat appeared on the political stage, this struggle over leadership has had a history of thirty years. The period from 1924, when the national bourgeoisie and the working class formed a revolutionary united front, to 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, was a history in which the two aspects of revolutionary unity and the struggle for leadership were intertwined. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "At this time, the national bourgeoisie (not the comprador bourgeoisie) was advancing along with the revolution. It was a revolutionary united front of the whole nation. This does not mean that there were no contradictions between revolution and the national bourgeoisie. It only means that in supporting the revolution, the national bourgeoisie tried its best to use the revolution for its own purposes, mainly following the line of seizing territory, and restricting the scope of the revolution."

However, in this struggle for leadership, the national bourgeoisie had the most fatal weakness. This, as Comrade Stalin said, was: "The political weakness of the national bourgeoisie, its dependence on imperialism, and its fear of the scale of the revolutionary movement." The national bourgeoisie could not obtain the assistance of the urban and rural laboring masses, it feared and opposed the peasant revolution, thus creating its isolated position domestically. The proletariat, on the contrary, as Comrade Stalin said: "The growing revolutionary initiative of the proletariat, and the growth of its prestige among the hundreds of millions of laboring masses." The fatal weakness of the national bourgeoisie was precisely the decisive advantage for the proletariat to gain and consolidate leadership. It was the leader of the peasant revolution, and only it could lead the liberation of the peasants.

The fatal weakness of the national bourgeoisie was not only in domestic conditions, but also in international conditions. The Chinese revolution was precisely in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, in the era of the general crisis of world capitalism, the system of world capitalism was riddled with holes and crumbling. It was impossible for the Chinese bourgeoisie to find a reliable backer there. But the Chinese proletariat was the opposite: since the Great October Socialist Revolution, a great socialist country has emerged in the world, and the world anti-imperialist revolutionary movement is like the rising sun. The friends of the Chinese proletariat are all over the world, and the Soviet Union is the most reliable and powerful friend of the Chinese people. These international conditions are entirely favorable to the struggle of the Chinese revolution.

Comrade Stalin clearly pointed out: "The crisis of world capitalism and the existence of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union—the experience of which the Chinese proletariat can successfully utilize—greatly facilitate the possibility of realizing the second path of the Chinese revolution." That is the fact.

At that time, Comrade Stalin opposed the traitor Trotskyites' attempt to leap over the stage the Chinese revolution was in and their various proposals to ingratiate themselves with the enemies of the Chinese revolution, and on the other hand, he opposed the traitor Chen Duxiu's various policies of accommodating the bourgeoisie's weakness and incompetence. Although the forms of expression of these traitors were not the same at that time, their activities were aimed at sabotaging the Chinese revolution and leading the Chinese revolution to failure, to suit the purposes of the imperialists, the Chinese feudal forces, and all enemies of the Chinese revolution, and subsequently these traitors quickly and completely united as one in this purpose. Comrade Stalin refuted these traitors' nonsense and argued that it was necessary to do everything possible to consolidate the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, lead the broad masses of urban and rural laborers, and use favorable international conditions to push the Chinese revolution forward on the second path. That is: "The basic task of the Communists lies in fighting for the second path of the Chinese revolution."

Comrade Stalin said: "The growth of the initiative of hundreds of millions of laboring masses is the main guarantee of revolutionary victory, and the arming of workers and peasants is the main antidote against counter-revolution." But without the leadership of the proletariat, these are impossible. Comrade Stalin insisted that the Communist Party should maintain its independence in the revolutionary united front. In Comrade Stalin's words, "This is a necessary condition for guaranteeing proletarian leadership in the bourgeois democratic revolution."

However, the Chinese revolution advanced on an extremely tortuous path. As Comrade Stalin pointed out: "In its path towards victory, the Chinese revolution will encounter far more difficulties than the Russian revolution, and there will be incomparably more defections and betrayals in the process of this revolution than during the Soviet civil war." After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, the heinous Chen Duxiu opportunists rejected Comrade Stalin's instructions, continued to deny that the proletariat should maintain its independence in the united front, did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses and arm the workers and peasants, and completely betrayed the peasant revolution and the arming of workers and peasants, which resulted in promoting the betrayal of the Wuhan government, and causing the failure of the 1927 revolution.

Despite this, our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the revolutionary line indicated by Comrade Stalin, independently opened up the broad road of agrarian revolution, regardless of the betrayal of the bourgeoisie, and advanced the revolution to a new stage. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the revolution retreated from the cities to the countryside, and combined this correct retreat and correct offense, turning this retreat into a new offense.

Exactly as Comrade Stalin estimated: "This land revolution will strengthen and expand the struggle against imperialism, against local tyrants and evil gentry and feudal landlords, against warlords and Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary clique."

Comrade Stalin wrote: "Chiang Kai-shek's coup d'état shows that from now on there will be two camps, two governments, two armies, and two centers in South China: the revolutionary center in Wuhan and the counter-revolutionary center in Nanjing." Due to Chen Duxiu's policy of compromise and Wang Jingwei's betrayal, the revolutionary center in Wuhan did not continue to be maintained, but Comrade Stalin's prediction was entirely correct. After Wang Jingwei succeeded Chiang Kai-shek in betraying the revolution, the center of the revolution shifted from Wuhan to the rural revolutionary base areas. Thus, the following situation was created throughout China: on the one hand, there was the counter-revolutionary camp, the counter-revolutionary government, the counter-revolutionary army, and the counter-revolutionary center headed by Chiang Kai-shek, but on the other hand, there was the revolutionary camp, the revolutionary government, the revolutionary army, and the revolutionary center headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Although the area of this revolutionary camp, this revolutionary center, was not very large at the beginning, because it was built on the foundation of the broad masses of workers and peasants, its strength was infinite, and it was bound to gradually expand and become the starting point for the Chinese people to seize national power under the leadership of the proletariat. Conversely, Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary camp, this counter-revolutionary center, although rampant for a time, and this counter-revolutionary rule occupied a large area for a time, because it was isolated among the people, its strength was bound to gradually weaken in the long counter-revolutionary war, and it was bound to perish.

In its counter-revolutionary process, the Chiang Kai-shek clique cruelly plundered the people, accumulated enormous wealth, and gradually formed its own bureaucratic bourgeoisie group, that is, the comprador, feudal, and military bureaucratic capital group. The main backstage bosses of this bureaucratic capital group were American and British imperialists, but this group was also a servant of Japanese imperialism. This indicates that Chiang Kai-shek was even more isolated among the people.

Under the oppression of the power of the great awakening of the Chinese people, and also due to the rivalry between American imperialism and Japanese imperialism in the Far East, Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly and unwillingly joined the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937. Relying on the advocacy and efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, China once again saw the emergence of a national united front including the bourgeoisie at this time. However, among the bourgeoisie who participated in the War of Resistance, there were already clearly divided into two different groups: one was the bureaucratic bourgeoisie group headed by Chiang Kai-shek, who was in power and was a tool of American and British imperialism, and the other was the national bourgeoisie group that was not in power.

Obviously, the policy of the Chinese Communist Party for a national united front including the bourgeoisie was entirely correct, just as the policy of the national united front including the national bourgeoisie established by the Chinese Communist Party during the 1924-1927 revolutionary period was entirely correct. Comrade Stalin once pointed out when refuting the nonsense of the traitor Trotskyites in 1927: "China is different from Russia in 1905, it is a semi-colonial country oppressed by imperialism; therefore, the Chinese revolution is not purely a bourgeois revolution, but a bourgeois revolution of the anti-imperialist type; imperialism holds the lifeline of industry, commerce and transportation in China: the oppression of imperialism touches not only the Chinese laboring masses, but also certain strata of the Chinese bourgeoisie; therefore, the Chinese bourgeoisie can support the Chinese revolution under certain conditions and for a certain period." ("Brief Comments on Current Affairs: On China") Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party's policy of the national united front was entirely correct and entirely necessary. This national united front was destroyed by the selfish goals of the bourgeoisie in 1927. However, the Japanese aggressors broke in, attempting to completely turn China into its colony, which caused new situations at home and abroad, and also caused new changes in the political situation of the Chinese bourgeoisie. This new situation made it necessary to re-raise the question of the national united front, and it was possible to establish a very broad anti-Japanese united front.

Of course, in this anti-Japanese united front, as Comrade Stalin pointed out in this great work in 1927, it was still full of struggles over the two paths. The struggle between the two paths was still a characteristic of the Chinese revolution during this period, and it intensified day by day.
First of all, there was the struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the issue of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on the one hand, the people's line, and on the other hand, the anti-people line. When the Chinese Communist Party established a united front with Chiang Kai-shek when he was forced to resist Japan, it was already preparing for his subsequent betrayal based on his extreme hatred of the people. The policy adopted by the Communist Party in this united front under the leadership of its brilliant leader Comrade Mao Zedong was the policy of both unity and struggle, the policy of independence and autonomy in the united front, the policy of fully mobilizing the masses and fully developing the masses' armed forces, and such a policy was exactly the policy proposed by Comrade Stalin in this great work in 1927. Obviously, only by rejecting the weak and incompetent policy of right-leaning opportunism at that time, and adopting a firm Marxist-Leninist policy, could the anti-Japanese forces of the people be developed, could the base areas be developed with the spirit of independence and autonomy, could the War of Resistance Against Japan be persisted in, could the Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic bourgeoisie group be isolated, and could Chiang Kai-shek's several counter-revolutionary offensives be defeated. This was to fight for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and to make this victory a victory for the people, to fight for the victory of the second path of the Chinese revolution, and to avoid the repetition of the 1927 disaster.

There was also a struggle over the political line between the Chinese proletariat and the national bourgeoisie during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the national bourgeoisie generally followed the Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic bourgeoisie group politically, and wanted to obtain a little small benefit politically and economically from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. It was only due to the continuous annexation and oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic bourgeoisie group that the national bourgeoisie gradually formed a relatively open middle faction politically. However, regarding the two paths of whether this country of China was to become a country led by the bourgeoisie or a country led by the proletariat, there was a struggle between the Chinese proletariat and the national bourgeoisie. Although the national bourgeoisie was dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's group, what it wanted to take was still the former path. The proletariat estimated the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and strived to get it to stand on the side of resisting Japan and the people, and not to stand on the side of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dictatorship, while at the same time criticizing its vacillation and its reactionary dreams. The proletariat independently led the peasant masses and united all patriotic people, and advanced towards the path it demanded to take.

Comrade Mao Zedong's famous work "On New Democracy" was the product of the fierce struggle over the issue of the two paths during this period. This work, based on Comrade Stalin's theory, pointed out the bankruptcy of the fantasy of attempting to establish a bourgeois dictatorship and a capitalist society in China, and that the only path the Chinese revolution must take is the second path, that is, the stage of establishing a new democratic society of the joint dictatorship of the various revolutionary classes in China led by the Chinese proletariat, and then developing it to the second stage to establish a Chinese socialist society.

Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding work, armed with the great thought of Lenin and Stalin, also armed the Chinese Communists, enabling us to maintain a clear mind at all times.

After Japan surrendered, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie group represented by Chiang Kai-shek acted as a running dog of American imperialism, openly betrayed the people, and ferociously declared war on the people. At this time, the national bourgeoisie felt that the national industry had fallen into disaster under the oppression of American imperialism and its running dogs, the four major families, and also felt that Chiang Kai-shek's rule was inevitably going to perish. However, the national bourgeoisie feared the revolution of the masses, and its representatives had spread the illusion of a so-called "third path" that was neither the path of the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek nor the path of the leadership of the Communist Party. That is to say, they still dreamed of a country that was not led by the working class, but a country led by the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Communist Party timely criticized and exposed the reactionary fantasy of this so-called "third path" of the national bourgeoisie, and at the same time estimated the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and American imperialism and bureaucratic capital, and believed that there was still a possibility of winning it over to the revolutionary side, and therefore adopted a policy of striving for it. The Chinese Communist Party led the people's masses, united all patriotic people, and fought against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the historical facts quickly proved the complete bankruptcy of this so-called "third path." The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its brilliant leader Comrade Mao Zedong, gained the support of the powerful socialist and democratic camp, finally defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, completely shattered American imperialism's arrogant plan to colonize China, and established a People's Republic of China led by the working class. That is to say, the Chinese revolution took exactly the second path pointed out by Comrade Stalin in his great work

In September 1949, the representatives of the national bourgeoisie participated in the Chinese People' Political Consultative Conference, and jointly supported and passed the Common Program proposed by the Chinese Communist Party with the representatives of other classes. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie became a component of the Chinese People' Democratic United Front.

The Common Program stipulates that our People's Democratic United Front and our People's Republic are led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Common Program stipulates that the state-owned economy is an economy of a socialist nature, and all social and economic components must obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, and speculative businesses must be strictly banned. The path of the Common Program is to thoroughly complete the cause of the Chinese democratic revolution under the leadership of the working class and gradually transition to socialist development.

Since the representatives of the national bourgeoisie raised their hands to pass the Common Program together with other representatives, they have the obligation to abide by the Common Program. For more than two years, the national bourgeoisie has shown a certain degree of enthusiasm in developing economic undertakings and participating in the struggle against imperialism. However, for more than two years, many lawless bourgeois elements have actually failed to keep their promises. Based on their profit-seeking, opportunistic, self-serving, and self-interested nature, on the one hand, they have sent their spies into our state organs and mass organizations, and on the other hand, they have used despicable means of enticement to turn some staff members in state organs and mass organizations into their agents. They have carried out rampant attacks on our country, on the working class, and on the entire people by engaging in bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, destroying many construction works in our country. That is to say, these illegal bourgeois elements did not consider how many times their attempts and dreams to establish a bourgeois dictatorship and capitalist rule had failed in history, and after the establishment of the People's Republic, they actually dreamed of using stealthy methods to usurp this People's Republic led by the great working class and won by the bloodshed and sacrifice of millions of people, dreaming of preventing this great People's Republic from preparing to go through new democratic construction and move towards socialist development. It is very clear that if we do not repel this arrogant attack by these illegal bourgeois elements, it will be very dangerous for our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in March 1949 that for a considerable period after the victory of the revolution, it would still be necessary to utilize the initiative of urban and rural private capitalism as much as possible to promote the development of the national economy. But at the same time, it pointed out that the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets" attack may corrupt some who are weak willed in the revolutionary ranks. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the Party must have full vigilance.

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy that we have conducted in state organs in recent months, and the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence that we have conducted in private industrial and commercial enterprises are movements of great historical significance, struggles of great historical significance. This struggle is for consolidating our country's financial and economic discipline, and at the same time it is a struggle about which path China will take. This struggle has educated the working class, educated the broad masses of the people, repelled the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, and under the supervision of the broad masses of awakened people, will prevent the bourgeoisie from daring to violate the law wantonly. This struggle further guarantees the path from new democracy to socialism.

Recalling the entire history of the Chinese revolution, as well as the various facts exposed in the current struggle, fully proves the great scientific foresight of Comrade Stalin in 1927 that "the struggle between the two revolutionary paths is the characteristic of the Chinese revolution." And the struggle between these two paths will still exist after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements.

Of course, our current policy towards the national bourgeoisie, apart from those major thieves with heinous crimes, is still a policy of unity, and we do not intend to eliminate the bourgeoisie economically. But the only standard for this unity is that the national bourgeoisie must earnestly support the leadership of the working class, earnestly implement the Common Program, and maintain and develop their initiative in economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as their initiative in participating in the struggle against imperialism. That is to say, the bourgeoisie must follow the path pointed out by the working class that is beneficial to the people, and must not follow the path planned by those illegal bourgeois elements that is detrimental to the people. If the bourgeoisie follows the path pointed out by the working class, earnestly supports the leadership of the working class, earnestly implements the Common Program, actively participates in the struggle against imperialism, and manages its own business under the leadership of the state-owned economy, then it still has its initiative at the present stage, and it can still be beneficial to the country. Conversely, if the bourgeoisie violates the Common Program, and still, like the illegal elements among them, harms the public for personal gain, turns public property into private property, and some even turn themselves into major thieves, and destroys the country's construction, then they have no initiative, and they are of no benefit to the country, but are simply committing crimes.

The bourgeoisie's attempt to make China embark on the path of capitalism is actually only to make China revert to the path of semi-colonialism and colonialism. However, it is very clear that if the bourgeoisie wants to continue this attempt, it is bound to fail completely. The awakened power of the Chinese working class is so strong, the broad masses of the Chinese people are so firmly united around the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, China has such a powerful people's army under the leadership of the working class, and we have such a strong socialist and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union to support us. These will make anyone in the bourgeoisie who has any evil activities that are detrimental to our country be bruised and bleeding.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," published in 1949 to commemorate the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party: "The people have a powerful state machine in their hands and are not afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebelling."

That is to say, China can only take one path, and this is the second path pointed out by Comrade Stalin in his great work in 1927. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on and developing Comrade Stalin's revolutionary line, has led our country onto this most correct path. This is the path that enables our people to give full play to their infinite vitality, and enables our country to embark on the road of infinite prosperity and infinite strength.

Comrade Stalin's idea of the struggle between the two paths of the Chinese revolution in this great work illuminates the path taken by the Chinese Communists in the past, present and future. The development of Chinese revolutionary events has developed according to Comrade Stalin's predictions, which proves the great historical significance of Comrade Stalin's great work. But the questions raised and resolved in this work actually have great significance not only for the Chinese revolution, but also for the revolutions in all colonies and semi-colonies.

Comrade Stalin - the great teacher of the international communist movement, all the works on the Chinese revolution, are extremely important contributions to the Chinese revolution, which have armed the minds of the Chinese Communists for a long time. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the victory of Comrade Stalin's doctrine on the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us that the Chinese Communists must study Lenin and Stalin's doctrines on the Chinese revolution, especially Comrade Stalin's doctrines on the Chinese revolution, in order to constantly strengthen the strength of combat and work. As we commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Comrade Stalin's great work "The Question of the Chinese Revolution," we understand even more the importance of this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong.

专栏：

    纪念斯大林同志的伟大著作“中国革命问题”的二十五周年
    陈伯达
    斯大林同志的伟大著作“中国革命问题”，发表于一九二七年四月二十一日。当时的情况，一方面是中国工人运动和农民运动的强大高涨，另一方面是帝国主义在上海袭击革命并在南京实行屠杀，而以蒋介石为首的国民党右派则公开投降帝国主义，叛变革命。正如斯大林同志所指出：“蒋介石底政变是表示民族资产阶级之退出革命。”革命的力量和反革命的力量形成了新的调动，新的分野，新的结合。中国革命正处在一个新的历史转折点。这个变化的新形势，向中国共产党，向中国无产阶级，向中国人民，进一步地提出了中国革命向何处去的问题。
    斯大林同志在他这个创造性的马克思主义的伟大著作中，根据他对于中国反帝国主义反封建主义的革命性质的分析，概括了中国革命的经验，指出了中国有两条发展的道路。
    斯大林同志说：
    “中国事变底发展有两条道路：
    或者民族资产阶级击破无产阶级，与帝国主义勾结，共同进攻革命，以便建立资本主义的统治来结束革命。
    或者无产阶级把民族资产阶级挤在一边，巩固自己的领导权，率领城乡千百万群众以克服民族资产阶级底反抗，取得资产阶级民主革命底完全胜利，然后把它逐渐转移到社会主义革命底轨道上，伴有由此产生的一切后果。
    二者必取其一。”
    这是斯大林同志的极端英明的指示。
    根据斯大林同志的指示，就是说，如果民族资产阶级打败无产阶级，那末，就会使中国革命陷于失败，使中国继续处在帝国主义的压迫之下，继续成为帝国主义的附属品。这是一条道路。反之，如果中国无产阶级能够继续巩固自己的领导权，克服民族资产阶级的反抗，那末，中国便将获得反帝国主义反封建主义的完全胜利，而逐步过渡向社会主义的发展。这又是一条道路。
    就是说，两条道路：一条是中国革命失败的道路，一条是中国革命胜利的道路。
    是否还有什么“第三条道路”呢？斯大林同志说：“二者必取其一。”其他什么“第三条道路”是并没有的。
    斯大林同志说：“这两条革命道路之间的斗争，乃是中国革命的特点。”二十五年来中国一切历史事变的发展，完全证明了斯大林同志这个天才的结论。
    决定两条道路的问题，正如斯大林同志所说明了的，乃是关于领导权或是属于资产阶级或是属于无产阶级的问题。从中国无产阶级出现在政治舞台上的时候起，这个关于领导权的斗争，已经有了三十来年的历史。从一九二四年民族资产阶级和工人阶级成立革命的统一战线到一九二七年蒋介石叛变的这一个时期，便是一方面是革命的联合和另一方面是关于领导权的斗争——这两个方面互相交错的历史。斯大林同志指出：“在这个时候，民族资产阶级（不是买办资产阶级）是与革命一道前进的。这是全民族联合战线底革命。这并不是说，革命与民族资产阶级之间不曾有过矛盾。这只是说，民族资产阶级在支持革命时，竭力为了自己的目的来利用革命，使革命主要循着夺取地盘的路线进行，并且限制革命底规模。”
    可是，在这个关于领导权的斗争中，民族资产阶级有了最致命的弱点。这正如斯大林同志所说的：“民族资产阶级的政治上的软弱，它对于帝国主义的依赖，它对革命运动规模的畏惧。”民族资产阶级不能取得城乡劳动群众的援助，它害怕农民革命并反对农民革命，这样就造成了它在国内的孤立的地位。无产阶级却相反，这也正如斯大林同志所说的：“无产阶级底日益增长的革命积极性，它在千百万劳动群众中间的威信之增长。”民族资产阶级之致命的弱点，恰恰就是无产阶级获得和巩固领导权的决定性的优点。它是农民革命的领袖，而且也只有它才能够领导农民的解放。
    民族资产阶级之致命的弱点，不只是在国内条件上，而且是还在国际的条件上。中国的革命正是处在帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，是处在世界资本主义总危机的时代，世界资本主义的系统已是百孔千疮，摇摇欲坠。中国资产阶级是不可能从那里找到一个靠得住的靠山的。但中国无产阶级却相反：自从伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，世界已经出现了伟大的社会主义国家，世界反帝国主义的革命运动正如太阳方升。中国无产阶级的朋友遍于全世界，首先苏联是中国人民最可靠而强有力的朋友。这种国际的条件，对于中国革命的斗争来说，是完全有利于无产阶级的。
    斯大林同志明显地指出：“世界资本主义的危机及苏联无产阶级专政底存在——这一专政底经验，中国无产阶级可以顺利地利用——大大地便利于中国革命第二条道路实现的可能性。”事实就是如此。
    斯大林同志当时一方面反对了叛徒托洛茨基派企图跳越过中国革命所正处的阶段及其所提出的献媚于中国革命的敌人的种种主张，一方面反对了叛徒陈独秀派迁就资产阶级的懦弱无能的种种政策。这些叛徒们当时表现的形式虽然不是一样的，但他们的活动都是在于破坏中国革命，把中国革命引到失败，以适合于帝国主义者、中国封建势力和一切中国革命敌人的目的，而随后这些叛徒也就很快地在这个目的上完全结合而为一体了。斯大林同志驳斥了这些叛徒们的胡说，而认为必须竭力巩固中国无产阶级的领导权，率领广大的城乡劳动群众，利用国际有利的条件，把中国革命推向第二条道路上前进。就是说：“共产党员的基本任务是在于为中国革命第二条道路而斗争。”
    斯大林同志说：“数万万劳动群众的积极性之增长乃是革命胜利的主要保障，而工农的武装，乃是反对反革命的主要解毒剂。”但如果没有无产阶级的领导权，这些是不可能的。斯大林同志坚持共产党在革命统一战线中应该保持自己的独立性。照斯大林同志的话说来，“这是保障在资产阶级民主革命中无产阶级领导权所必要的条件”。
    但是，中国革命是在极为曲折的道路上前进的。正如斯大林同志所指出：“中国革命在走向胜利的道路上比起俄国革命要遇到更多得多的困难，在这一革命进程中的投敌和叛变比起苏联内战时期将更多得无比。”在蒋介石叛变以后，罪恶的陈独秀机会主义者，拒绝斯大林同志的指示，继续否认无产阶级在统一战线中保持自己的独立性，不敢放手地发动群众和武装工农，他们在农民革命和武装工农面前完全表现出叛变的行为，结果就促进了武汉政府的叛变，而使一九二七年的革命遭受到失败。
    虽然如此，我们党却根据斯大林同志所指示的革命路线，在毛泽东同志的领导下，不顾资产阶级的叛变，独立地开辟了广阔的土地革命的道路，把革命推进了新的阶段。在毛泽东同志的领导下，革命从城市退却到农村，而又把这种革命的正确的退却和正确的进攻结合起来，使这种退却转而变成了新的进攻。
    完全如斯大林同志的估计：“这种土地革命将加强和扩大反帝国主义、反土豪劣绅和封建地主、反军阀及蒋介石反革命集团的斗争。”
    斯大林同志写道：“蒋介石底政变表明着：从此以后在华南将有两个营垒、两个政府、两个军队、两个中心：武汉的革命中心和南京的反革命中心。”由于陈独秀的妥协政策和汪精卫的叛变，武汉这个革命中心没有继续保持下来，但是斯大林同志的预见完全是正确的。在汪精卫继蒋介石而叛变以后，革命的中心由武汉转移到农村革命的根据地。于是，在整个中国便造成了这样一个形势：一方面是以蒋介石为首的反革命营垒、反革命政府、反革命军队、反革命中心，但另一方面，则是以毛泽东同志为首的革命营垒、革命政府、革命军队、革命中心。这个革命营垒、这个革命中心，虽然开始在地区上的面积还不算很大，但是因为它是建立在广大的工农群众的基础上的，所以它的力量乃是无限的，它是必然要逐步扩大，成为中国人民在无产阶级领导下夺取全国政权的出发点。而相反，蒋介石这个反革命营垒，这个反革命中心，虽然一时是很猖獗的，这个反革命统治虽然一时占有很大的面积，但是，因为它在人民中是孤立的，所以在长期进行反革命的战争当中，它的力量就必然要逐步削弱，它是一定要灭亡的。
    蒋介石集团在其反革命的过程中，残酷地掠夺人民，堆积了庞大的财富，逐步地形成了自己的官僚资产阶级集团，即买办的、封建的、军事的官僚资本集团。这个官僚资本集团的主要后台老板是美英帝国主义者，但这个集团同时也是日本帝国主义的奴才。这是表示蒋介石在人民中更加陷于孤立的地位。
    在中国人民伟大的觉醒的力量的压迫之下，同时也由于美帝国主义和日本帝国主义在远东的争霸，蒋介石于一九三七年无可奈何地和不得已地参加了抗日战争。依靠中国共产党的倡导和努力，中国在这时候重新出现了包括资产阶级在内的民族统一战线。但是在参加抗日的资产阶级当中，已经很显然地分为两个有差别的集团：一个即是以蒋介石为首的、当权的、美英帝国主义工具的官僚资产阶级集团，一个乃是不当权的民族资产阶级集团。
    显然，中国共产党这个包括资产阶级在内的民族统一战线的政策，是完全正确的，正如中国共产党在一九二四——一九二七年革命时期所建立的包括民族资产阶级在内的民族统一战线的政策是完全正确的一样。斯大林同志在一九二七年驳斥叛徒托洛茨基派胡说的时候，曾经这样指出：“中国与一九○五年的俄国不同，是一个被帝国主义压迫的半殖民地国家；因此中国革命不单纯是资产阶级革命，而且是反帝国主义类型的资产阶级革命；帝国主义在中国把持着工业、商业和交通底命脉：帝国主义底压迫不仅触到中国劳动群众，而且也触到中国资产阶级某些阶层；中国资产阶级因此在某些条件下和某一时期内能支持中国革命。”（“时事问题简评：关于中国”）因此，中国共产党这个民族统一战线的政策，是完全正确的，完全必要的。这个民族统一战线在一九二七年被资产阶级自私的目的所破坏。然而日本侵略者打进来了，企图把中国完全变成它的殖民地，这样又引起了国内外的新的形势，也引起了中国资产阶级在政治上的新的变化，这个新的形势就又必要重新提出了民族统一战线的问题，而且有可能建立一个很广泛的抗日统一战线。
    当然，在这个抗日统一战线中，仍然如斯大林同志在一九二七年这个伟大著作所指出的，充满了关于两条道路的斗争。两条道路的斗争依然是这个时期中国革命的特点，并且一天一天地激化起来。
    首先是中国共产党和蒋介石集团在抗日战争问题上一方面是人民的路线而另一方面是反人民的路线之间的斗争。当中国共产党在蒋介石被迫抗日而和他建立统一战线的时候，即已根据他对于人民的极端仇恨而准备他在以后的叛变。共产党在它的英明领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，在这个统一战线中所采取的政策便是又联合又斗争的政策，是统一战线中的独立自主的政策，是充分放手发动群众和充分放手发展群众武装的政策，而这样的政策就正是斯大林同志在一九二七年这个伟大著作所提出了的政策。显然地，只有拒绝当时右倾机会主义的软弱无能的政策，而采取坚定的马克思列宁主义的政策，才能够发展人民的抗日力量，才能够以独立自主的精神发展根据地，才能够坚持抗日战争，孤立蒋介石这个官僚资产阶级集团，并打退蒋介石几次反革命的进攻。这就是为抗日战争的胜利和使这胜利成为人民的胜利而斗争，为中国革命的第二条道路的胜利而斗争，而避免一九二七年的覆辙。
    中国无产阶级和民族资产阶级在抗日战争时期也有政治路线的斗争。抗日战争初期，民族资产阶级在政治上一般地还是跟随蒋介石的官僚资产阶级集团，而想在政治上经济上从官僚资产阶级那里得到
    一点小利益。只是由于蒋介石官僚资产阶级集团的不断的吞并和压迫，民族资产阶级才在政治上逐步地形成为比较公开的中间派。但是关于中国这个国家是要成为资产阶级领导的国家、或者成为无产阶级领导的国家，这两条道路，则是在中国无产阶级和民族资产阶级之间是斗争了的。民族资产阶级虽然不满意蒋介石的集团，但想走的还是前一条道路。无产阶级估计到民族资产阶级和官僚资产阶级之间的矛盾，争取它站在抗日和人民的方面，而不去站在蒋介石反革命独裁的方面，同时，则批判了它的动摇和它的反动梦想。无产阶级独立自主地领导农民群众和团结一切爱国的人们，向着自己所要求走的道路前进。
    毛泽东同志著名的著作“新民主主义论”，便是在这个时期中关于两条道路问题激烈斗争的产物。这个著作根据斯大林同志的理论，指出了那种在中国企图建立资产阶级专政和资本主义社会的迷梦的破产，而中国革命必然走的，只能是第二条道路，即由建立以中国无产阶级为首领的中国各个革命阶级联合专政的新民主主义社会这一个阶段，再使之发展到第二个阶段，以建立中国社会主义社会。
    毛泽东同志这个以列宁斯大林的伟大思想为武装的杰出的著作，也就武装了中国共产党人，使我们能够随时保持清醒的头脑。
    在日本投降以后，以蒋介石为代表的官僚资产阶级集团充当美帝国主义的走狗，公开地叛变人民，穷凶极恶地向人民宣战。在这个时候，民族资产阶级感觉到民族工业在美帝国主义及其走狗四大家族的压迫之下已陷于没落的灾难，也感觉到蒋介石的统治已经不可免地要灭亡。但民族资产阶级却害怕群众的革命，它的代表们曾经散布了所谓既不是蒋介石国民党的道路又不是共产党领导的道路而有什么“第三条道路”的幻想。就是说，他们仍然梦想一个不是由工人阶级领导的国家、而是一个由资产阶级领导的国家。中国共产党及时地批判了和揭穿了民族资产阶级这种所谓“第三条道路”的反动幻想，同时也估计到民族资产阶级和美帝国主义及官僚资本的矛盾，而认为还有争取它到革命方面来的可能，因而采取了争取它的政策。中国共产党领导人民群众，团结一切爱国的人们，去对蒋介石匪帮作战，而历史的事实恰恰很快地证明了这种所谓“第三条道路”的完全破产。伟大的中国人民在中国共产党及其英明的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，获得了强大的社会主义和民主阵营的支持，终于战胜了蒋介石匪帮，完全粉碎了美帝国主义的狂妄的殖民地化中国的计划，建立了一个由工人阶级领导的中华人民共和国。就是说，中国革命走的正是斯大林同志在他这个伟大著作中所指出的第二条道路。
    一九四九年九月间，民族资产阶级的代表们参加了中国人民政治协商会议，并与其他阶级的代表们共同拥护了和通过了中国共产党所提出的共同纲领，因此，民族资产阶级成为中国人民民主战线的一个组成部分。
    共同纲领规定了我们的人民民主战线和我们的人民共和国是由工人阶级领导，而以工农联盟为基础的。共同纲领规定了国营经济为社会主义性质的经济，各种社会经济成分都必须服从国营经济的领导，投机事业要受严格的取缔。共同纲领的道路正是在工人阶级领导下彻底完成中国民主主义革命的事业而逐步过渡向社会主义发展的道路。
    民族资产阶级的代表们既然和其他的代表们一道举手通过了共同纲领，就有信守共同纲领的义务。两年多以来，民族资产阶级在发展经济事业的方面和参加反对帝国主义斗争的方面，是表现了它的一定积极性的。但是，两年多以来，很多不守法的资产阶级分子竟然不守信约，从他们的唯利是图、投机取巧、损公利私、损人利己的本性出发，一方面向我们的国家机关以及群众团体派进了他们的坐探，另方面又用卑鄙勾引的手段把国家机关和群众团体中的某些工作人员变成他们的代理人。他们用行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的犯法活动，向我们的国家、向工人阶级、向全体人民，进行了猖狂的进攻，破坏了我们国家的许多建设工作。这些也就是说，这些不法资产阶级分子没有考虑他们关于建立资产阶级专政和资本主义统治的企图和梦想在历史上已经有了多少次的破产，而当人民共和国成立以后，他们竟然又梦想用偷偷摸摸的方法篡夺这一个由伟大的工人阶级所领导的、经过千百万人民流血牺牲而得来的人民共和国，梦想阻止这个伟大的人民共和国准备经过新民主主义的建设而走向社会主义发展的道路。很明白，如果我们不打退这些不法资产阶级分子这种狂妄的进攻，那对于我们国家是很危险的。
    毛泽东同志在一九四九年三月党的第七届第二次中央委员会全体会议上指出了在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内还需要尽可能地利用城乡私人资本主义的积极性，以利于国民经济的发展。但同时又指出了资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的攻击，可能腐蚀一些革命队伍中的意志薄弱者。毛泽东同志指出了党必须有充分的警惕性。
    在毛泽东同志的领导下，我们在最近几个月来在国家机关中所进行的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，以及我们在私人工商业中所进行的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的运动，这是有伟大的历史意义的运动，有伟大的历史意义的斗争。这一个斗争是为巩固我们国家的财政经济纪律，同时也是关于中国走向那一条道路的斗争。这个斗争教育了工人阶级，教育了广大的人民，打退了不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻，而在广大的觉悟群众的监督下，将使资产阶级不敢再放肆地违法犯法。这一个斗争进一步地保证着由新民主主义走向社会主义的道路。
    回忆了中国革命这一切的历史，以及现在斗争中所暴露出来的种种事实，完全证明了斯大林同志在一九二七年指出的“两条革命道路之间的斗争乃是中国革命的特点”这样一个伟大的科学预见。而且这两条道路的斗争，在“三反”“五反”运动后也还是会要存在的。
    当然，我们现在对于民族资产阶级的政策，除了那些罪大恶极的大盗窃分子以外，还是联合的政策，还不是要在经济上消灭资产阶级。但这个联合唯一的标准，乃是民族资产阶级要认真地拥护工人阶级的领导，认真地执行共同纲领，保持和发展他们有利于国计民生的经济事业的积极性以及参加反帝国主义斗争的积极性。就是说，资产阶级必须按照工人阶级所指出的有利于人民的道路上走，而不能按照那些不法资产阶级分子所谋划的不利于人民的道路上走。如果资产阶级按照工人阶级所指出的道路上走，认真地拥护工人阶级的领导，认真地执行共同纲领，积极地参加反对帝国主义的斗争，并在国营经济的领导下去经营自己的事业，那么，在现阶段就还有它的积极性，对于国家就还能够有益处。反之，如果资产阶级违反共同纲领，还要像其中的不法分子那样，损公利私，化公为私，有些人甚至把自己变成大盗窃犯，而破坏国家的建设，那么，他们也就没有什么积极性，对于国家就没有什么好处，而只是犯罪。
    资产阶级企图使中国走上资本主义的道路，实际上只是要使中国回复到半殖民地和殖民地的道路。但是，很显然的，资产阶级如果要继续它这个企图，是必然地要彻头彻尾地失败的。中国工人阶级的觉悟力量是这样的强大，中国的广大人民是这样牢固地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，中国有这样强大的在工人阶级领导下的人民军队，我们又有这样强大的以苏联为首的社会主义和民主阵营的支援，这些就使得资产阶级任何人如果有任何不利于我们国家的罪恶的活动，都将碰得皮破血流。
    毛泽东同志在一九四九年纪念中国共产党二十八周年所发表的著作“论人民民主专政”早已指出：“人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反。”
    就是说，中国只能走一条道路，这就是斯大林同志在一九二七年这个伟大著作中所指出的第二条道路。毛泽东同志根据了和发展了斯大林同志的革命路线，把我们国家引上了这个最正确的道路。这是我国人民能够发挥其无限生命力、而使我国能够走上无限繁荣和无限强大的道路。
    斯大林同志在他这个伟大著作中关于中国革命两条道路之间的斗争这一个思想，在过去现在和将来都照耀中国共产党人所走的道路。中国革命事变的发展，是按照斯大林同志的预见而发展的，这正是证明了斯大林同志这个伟大著作的伟大的历史意义。但是这篇著作所提出的以及所解决的问题，实际上不但对中国革命有伟大的意义，而且对所有殖民地半殖民地的革命都是有伟大的意义的。
    斯大林同志——这位国际共产主义运动的伟大导师，关于中国革命问题的一切著作，都是对于中国革命的极重大的贡献，长时期以来武装了中国共产党人的头脑。中国革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，也即是斯大林同志关于中国革命学说的胜利。毛泽东同志经常告诉我们：中国共产党人必须好好地研究列宁斯大林关于中国革命的学说，特别是研究斯大林同志关于中国革命的学说，用以不断加强战斗和工作的力量。我们纪念斯大林同志“中国革命问题”这个伟大著作的二十五周年，我们就更懂得了毛泽东同志这一个指示的重要性。
