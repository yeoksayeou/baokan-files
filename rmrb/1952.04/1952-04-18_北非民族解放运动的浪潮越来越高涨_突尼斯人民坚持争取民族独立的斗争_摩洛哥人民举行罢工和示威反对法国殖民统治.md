(Xinhua News Agency, April 17th) Tunis Dispatch: The Tunisian people are persisting in their heroic struggle for national independence.

Since the Tunisian people held a general strike and large-scale demonstrations in mid-January to get rid of colonial enslavement, the French colonialists have exhausted all means in a vain attempt to strangle Tunisia's national independence movement. In the end, they even barbarously arrested the Prime Minister of the former Tunisian government, who sympathized with the independence movement, and forced the King of Tunisia to appoint Bakush, a loyal lackey of France, as Prime Minister on March 28, to organize a pro-French new government. However, despite this, the Tunisian people have continued to fight harder. On April 1, workers and civil servants in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, Sfax, and many other places, disregarding the martial law declared by the colonial authorities, enthusiastically responded to the call of the Tunisian Workers' Union and the Tunisian Trade Union Federation and held a 24-hour general strike to protest the new persecution of the Tunisian national liberation movement by the French colonialists. Merchants also refused to open their shops to show their protest. On the 9th, the Tunisian people commemorated the national independence demonstration of April 9, 1938, and held general strikes and market strikes in cities and towns across the country. The Tunisian people's resolute will and combat actions to fight for national independence have powerfully struck at the French colonialists' activities of instigating Bakush to organize a puppet government. It was not until April 12, with the support of the bayonets of the French colonial army, that Bakush reluctantly pieced together his "new government," which even the Associated Press admitted was "powerless." As soon as the news of the "government" taking office spread, all the Arab shops in Tunis immediately closed their doors in protest. On the 14th, the Tunisian people gathered in the Great Mosque to hold a protest meeting. After the meeting, the masses, regardless of the obstruction of a large number of fully armed police, held a large demonstration in front of Bakush's Prime Minister's Office. The New Independence Party of Tunisian nationalists issued a statement accusing the Bakush government of being a "puppet government used to deceive public opinion and influence the decisions of the United Nations Security Council." (Note: The Tunisian issue was submitted to the Security Council for discussion by eleven Arab and Asian countries at the end of last month.)

The heroic struggle of the Tunisian people continues to receive the sympathy and support of the people of all countries. In France, workers and chemical workers at the Renault factory in Paris held grand rallies to protest French colonial oppression. In French North Africa, Algeria and Morocco, people held demonstrations to support the struggle of the Tunisian people. The "Algerian Front for the Defense and Respect of Freedom" announced that the Algerian people and the Tunisian people are united in the struggle for independence. In India, people in New Delhi and Mumbai held mass rallies and demonstrations to protest French atrocities. In Indonesia, the Indonesian Student Union sent a telegram encouraging Tunisian students to fight to the end for freedom.

(Xinhua News Agency) Just as the Tunisian people who are fighting for national independence are resolutely resisting the French colonialists' brutal suppression, Morocco has also erupted into strikes and demonstrations against colonial rule and demanding national independence.

March 30 was the 40th anniversary of France forcing Morocco to accept the "Protectorate Treaty." The Moroccan people turned this day of humiliation into a day of struggle for national independence. On this day, in Tangier, the so-called international co-managed zone, 3,000 Moroccan people held a demonstration. The police arrested many demonstrators and opened fire on the crowds densely packed in front of the police station demanding the release of the arrested, resulting in the tragic death of 25 people and injuries to more than 160 people. However, the demonstrators carried the bodies of their martyred comrades and continued to march in the streets, shouting slogans along the way, demanding national independence. In Casablanca, the largest port in French Morocco, and many other places, workers held strikes and demonstrations. Employees hired by French families also refused to work. Shops and cafes were tightly closed or hung black纱 at the door to protest French enslavement.

The Moroccan Communist Party issued a declaration on the eve of the 40th anniversary of Morocco's acceptance of the "Protectorate Treaty," emphasizing that all national forces in Morocco have the possibility of uniting at present. In order to achieve genuine national independence, the "Protectorate Treaty" must be abolished, an autonomous National Assembly must be elected, and a government responsible to the Assembly must be organized.

(Xinhua News Agency, April 17th) TASS Beirut, 16th: A reporter from the Lebanese "Oriental Daily" reported that the people of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, held a large-scale anti-imperialist demonstration. The main slogans during the demonstration accused Washington of plotting the so-called joint defense and oil agreement plan between the Iraqi government and the British Petroleum Company. In the clashes between the police and the demonstrators, two people were killed, thirty-seven people were injured, and dozens of people were arrested. The newspaper said that the people of Baghdad held a general strike to protest the actions of the authorities and the police.

    北非民族解放运动的浪潮越来越高涨
    突尼斯人民坚持争取民族独立的斗争
    摩洛哥人民举行罢工和示威反对法国殖民统治
    【新华社十七日讯】突尼斯消息：突尼斯人民坚持争取民族独立的英勇斗争。
    自从一月中旬突尼斯人民为摆脱殖民奴役而举行大罢工和大示威以来，法国殖民者用尽各种手段，妄图绞杀突尼斯的民族独立运动，最后甚至蛮横地逮捕突尼斯前政府同情独立运动的首相并强迫突尼斯王在三月二十八日委任法国的忠实走卒巴库士为首相，组织亲法的新政府。但是，尽管如此，突尼斯人民却一直再接再厉地进行斗争。四月一日，突尼斯首都突尼斯市、斯法克斯及其他许多地方的工人和公务员，不顾殖民当局宣布的戒严令，热烈响应突尼斯工人工会和突尼斯工会联合会的号召，举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议法国殖民者对突尼斯民族解放运动的新的迫害。商人们也拒绝开市，以示抗议。九日，突尼斯人民为纪念一九三八年四月九日民族独立大示威，又在全国各城市和乡镇举行总罢工、罢市。突尼斯人民争取民族独立的坚决意志和战斗行动，有力地打击了法国殖民者主使巴库士组织傀儡政府的活动，直到四月十二日，靠着法国殖民军的刺刀的支持，巴库士才勉强凑起他的连美联社也承认为“毫无权力可言”的“新政府”。这个“政府”就职的消息一传出，突尼斯市的全部阿拉伯商店就马上关上店门，以示抗议。十四日，突尼斯人民又聚集在回教大寺院里，举行抗议大会。会后群众不顾全副武装的大批警察的阻挠，到巴库士的首相府面前举行大示威。突尼斯民族主义者的新独立党发表声明，指责巴库士政府是“用来欺骗舆论和影响联合国安理会决定的傀儡政府”。（按突尼斯问题已由十一个阿拉伯及亚洲国家在上月底提请安理会讨论。）
    突尼斯人民的英勇斗争，继续获得各国人民的同情和支援。在法国，巴黎雷诺汽车厂的工人和化学工人举行了盛大集会，抗议法国的殖民压迫。在法属北非的阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥，人民纷纷举行示威，支援突尼斯人民的斗争。“阿尔及利亚保卫与尊重自由阵线”宣布阿尔及利亚人民和突尼斯人民在争取独立的斗争中团结一致。在印度，新德里和孟买的人民举行群众大会和示威，抗议法国的暴行。在印尼，印尼学生联合会打电报鼓励突尼斯学生为自由斗争到底。
    【新华社讯】正当争取民族独立的突尼斯人民坚决反抗法国殖民者的横暴镇压的时候，摩洛哥又爆发了反对殖民统治、要求民族独立的罢工和示威。
    三月三十日是法国强迫摩洛哥接受“保护国条约”的四十周年纪念日。摩洛哥人民把这个屈辱的日子变成争取民族独立的斗争日。这一天，在所谓国际共管区的丹吉尔，三千摩洛哥人民举行示威。警察逮捕了许多示威者，并且向密集在警察局前要求释放被捕者的群众开枪，结果有二十五人惨遭杀害，一百六十多人受伤。但是示威群众抬着殉难同伴们的尸体，继续在街道上游行，沿途高呼口号，要求民族独立。在法属摩洛哥的第一大港卡萨布兰卡及其他许多地方，工人们都举行了罢工和示威，受雇于法国人家庭的雇工也拒绝工作，商店和咖啡馆都紧闭着门，或是在门口悬挂黑纱，表示抗议法国的奴役。
    摩洛哥共产党在摩洛哥接受“保护国条约”四十周年纪念日的前夕曾发表宣言，强调指出：目前摩洛哥一切民族力量有团结起来的可能。为了实现真正的民族独立，必须废除“保护国条约”，选举自主的国民议会，并且组织向议会负责的政府。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特十六日讯：黎巴嫩的“东方报”记者报道，伊拉克首都巴格达人民举行了一次大规模的反帝国主义示威游行。示威游行中主要的口号是指责华盛顿方面阴谋制订的伊拉克政府和英国石油公司之间的所谓联合防务和石油协定的计划。在警察和示威者发生冲突时，有两个人被杀害，三十七个人受伤，几十个人被逮捕。该报说，巴格达人民举行了一次总罢工，以抗议当局和警察的行动。
