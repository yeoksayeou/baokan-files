Many Labor Models in Lushan County, Henan Province,
    Formulate Plans to Increase Production and Practice Economy
In 1951, the peasants of Lushan County, Henan Province, successfully completed their production increase plan. The average yield of fine grains per mu of farmland in the county increased from 200 jin in 1950 to 227 jin in 1951. Many mutual aid teams created new production records. For example, the mutual aid team led by the famous labor model Su Dianxuan averaged 530 jin of fine grains per mu in 1951, an increase of one-third compared to 1950; the Chen Wang mutual aid team averaged 743 jin of fine grains per mu in 1951, an even greater increase compared to 1950. Many high yields per unit area appeared within mutual aid teams, such as farmer Zhang Xianwu averaging nearly 1,000 jin of rice per mu; Wang Laigen intercropping corn and beans, averaging 500 jin of corn and 225 jin of beans per mu; Wang Wenju producing 4,620 jin of ginger per mu; Liu Yongzhen producing 700 jin of tobacco per mu, and so on. These high-yield achievements were all created on the basis of organization. This pointed out the direction of effort for the peasants throughout the county. This year, many labor models have expressed their intention to respond to Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production and practicing economy" and have unanimously formulated a common patriotic plan to increase production and practice economy, striving to lead the masses to increase grain production by 15% throughout the county this year. They have written to Chairman Mao to express their determination to increase production and practice economy.

    河南鲁山县许多劳动模范
    制订增产节约计划
    一九五一年河南鲁山县的农民胜利地完成了增产计划。一九五○年全县农田每亩平均产细粮二百斤，一九五一年已提高到二百二十七斤。不少互助组创造出了生产新纪录。如著名劳动模范苏殿选领导的互助组，一九五一年平均每亩产细粮五百三十斤，比一九五○年提高了三分之一；陈旺互助组一九五一年平均每亩产细粮七百四十三斤，比一九五○年提高的更多。许多单位面积的高额产量都出现在互助组里面，如农民张现五平均每亩产稻谷近一千斤；王来根实行玉茭和豆子间作，每亩平均收玉米五百斤和豆子二百二十五斤；王文聚一亩姜产四千六百二十斤；刘永振一亩烟产七百斤，等等。他们的这些丰产成绩，都是在组织起来的基础上创造出来的。这就给全县农民指出了努力的方向。今年许多劳动模范都表示要响应毛主席“增产节约”的号召，并且一致订出了共同的爱国增产节约计划，要带领群众为今年全县增产一成半粮食而努力。他们已写信给毛主席表示了增产节约的决心。
