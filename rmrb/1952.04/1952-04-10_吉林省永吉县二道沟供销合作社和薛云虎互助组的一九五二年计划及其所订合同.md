Editor's Note: The plans of the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team are both practical and specific, closely integrated, and the supply and marketing responsibilities of both parties are determined in the form of a contract; this is a concrete implementation of Section 2 of Part 3 of the State Council of the Central People's Government's decision on agricultural production in 1952. Earnestly implementing the contract and completing the plan will inevitably lead to the development of both. This method can be vigorously promoted in various places.

According to the nature of supply and marketing cooperatives, they should concentrate on doing a good job in trade for their members. They should not have the functions of setting up farm gardens, breeding stations, and leading mutual aid teams. However, based on specific historical conditions, it has done so, and it has played a role, which is good. In the future, in order to ensure the good development of supply and marketing cooperatives, and at the same time, to raise agricultural production mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives, farm gardens and breeding stations should be allocated to agricultural production mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the current leadership relationship between the two should be changed to a supply and marketing contract relationship. In areas where banking services have not yet been developed in rural areas, the credit department of the supply and marketing cooperative can be temporarily retained. However, its funds must be clearly distinguished from the funds of the supply and marketing cooperative and must not be mixed up.

I

In 1948, Erdaogou Village, Yongji County, ended land reform, and the peasants were distributed land; however, because the "foundation was too empty," the lives and production of the peasants were still very difficult. Although mutual aid teams were organized, they later collapsed due to weak leadership. In the winter of 1949, the Communist Party branch decided to start a supply and marketing cooperative first in response to the call to "get organized." At that time, the peasants had no money to invest in shares, so the branch called on and organized the peasants to go up the mountain to pick grapes and hazelnuts, and engage in sideline occupations, turning winter leisure into winter busy. This solved the problem of lacking capital. After this period of exploration, Liu Fang, the director of the cooperative, found two principles: First, if the cooperative wants to develop and grow, it must do a good job in production and increase the purchasing power of the peasants; second, if it wants to do a good job in production, it must get organized.

In the past two years, the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative has developed rapidly, not only organizing 95% of the village's population, but also supporting and leading 57 agricultural production mutual aid teams (of which 20 mutual aid teams have become long-term and consolidated, and five have been selected as county-wide model groups); it has established a farm garden, a breeding station, a credit department, a busy season nursery, and a mobile library.

Why has the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative been able to develop and grow rapidly, drive agricultural production, and become a good cooperative?

First of all, the business policy of the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative is to pay attention to serving production and starting from the production needs of the peasants. In the past two years, the cooperative has lent 71.43 million yuan to the mutual aid teams, helping them buy 49 heads of livestock, 8 carts, 2 straw bag machines, and 8,500 jin of various cash crop seeds.

In the spring of 1951, the government called for the planting of more cash crops, and the cooperative actively purchased high-quality seeds such as cotton, hemp, and soybeans to supply to the peasants, so that the village planted 51 hectares more soybeans, 12 hectares of kenaf, 6 hectares of hemp seeds, and 13 hectares of sunflowers than in 1950.

During the busy farming season, the cooperative extracted 1 million yuan from the public reserve fund to set up a busy season nursery, which accommodated 12 or 13 children every day, allowing 15 working women to participate in production with peace of mind, and solving the difficulty of insufficient labor for some families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers.

At the same time, the cooperative also set up a farm garden, raising two "Berkshire" breeding pigs, 6 boxes of bees, 9 foreign rabbits, a stallion, cultivating 280,000 fruit seedlings, and trial-raising "two-knife" tussah silkworms; it plans to improve the village's pig breeds within two years, improve the village's horse breeds within five years, and cultivate public fruit forests after six years.

Secondly, the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the policy of combining with mutual aid teams. In the past two years, the loans the cooperative made to mutual aid teams accounted for 69% of the total amount of credit department loans. In terms of supply business, credit loans, product sales, livestock mating, and the promotion of high-quality seeds, mutual aid teams are given priority to reward "getting organized." The cooperative also helps mutual aid teams formulate production plans and solve specific production difficulties. For example, in 1951, it helped the Liang Fengshan and Xu Yonghe long-term mutual aid teams purchase horses, solving their spring plowing difficulties. At the same time, the cooperative also combined its own supply and marketing plans with the production, sales, and consumption plans of the mutual aid teams, enhancing the planning of business operations.

Through a series of concrete facts of assistance to mutual aid teams, the superiority of combining mutual aid teams and supply and marketing cooperatives is shown, giving individual farmers great stimulation and education, and making them appreciate the benefits of getting organized. The number of mutual aid teams in the village was 13 in the spring of 1950, and now it has developed to 57, organizing two-thirds of the village's labor force.

In addition, the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative also pays great attention to the cultural and educational work of peasants and members. Under the leadership of the cooperative, 15 reading groups were established, and more than 280 picture books and books were purchased for mobile reading, which improved the mutual aid teams' and cooperative members' understanding of the socialist future of getting organized, and strengthened the propaganda and education of collective production.

II

In order to do a better job this year, the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative has formulated a work plan for 1952, the main points of which are:

(1) On the basis of 1951, continue to consolidate the existing mutual aid teams, and develop 13 more mutual aid teams, so that 80% of the village's households and 68% of the labor force are organized.

Help mutual aid teams formulate production and consumption plans, sign supply and marketing contracts, and order monthly sales orders, so that the production and consumption of mutual aid teams do not encounter difficulties.

(2) Supply 30,000 jin of "Man Cang Jin" soybean seeds, 1,600 jin of kenaf seeds, and sunflower seeds that can be planted on 13 hectares of land, so that the whole village uses high-quality varieties. In addition, supply carts, horses, fertilizers, small farm tools, and other means of production to ensure that each mu increases production by 7 sheng of grain.

Mobilize members to develop sideline occupations: promote high-quality breeding pigs, make straw bags, and other sideline occupations, and strive for the total value of sideline production throughout the year to reach 461.33 million yuan.

(3) Sign a "combination contract" between the cooperative and the mutual aid teams to strengthen the planning of business operations. Strive for a capital turnover of 15.5 times throughout the year, an increase of 4.8 times compared with 1951; the whole year can save 38.78 million yuan.

Implement cost quotas, strengthen the planning of purchase and sales of goods, reduce the links in commodity circulation, and sign transportation contracts. Reduce direct costs from 3.87% in 1951 to 3.16%, and indirect costs from 1.05% in 1951 to 0.89%; the whole year will save 17.93 million yuan from direct and indirect costs.

(4) Improve transportation packaging and reduce inventory. Grain should be concentrated by mutual aid teams, striving for "no landing" during transportation to reduce losses, and the amount of commodity loss should be reduced from an average of 0.84% in 1951 to 0.5% (calculated in terms of amount), saving 7.07 million yuan throughout the year.

(5) Expand commodity supply to meet the needs of members. Goods should be expanded from 450 kinds to more than 600 kinds.

(6) Strengthen learning, give full play to the enthusiasm of work, and improve work efficiency. In 1951, the average workload per person was 123.92 million yuan, and in 1952 it was increased to 166.32 million yuan. Save 10.51 million yuan throughout the year.

During the busy farming season, implement delivery to the countryside to facilitate production and turn slack months into peak months.

(7) Develop farm gardens and breeding stations, and establish another livestock group under the leadership of the cooperative. Starting in February, absorb surplus capital for shareholding, and plan to absorb 15 million to 20 million yuan in shares; which can buy 50 to 60 calves.

(8) Develop savings, implement "save whatever you have," and help members sell unsalable local products and by-products, striving for savings of 100 million yuan throughout 1952.

(9) Carry out cultural and educational work: continue to promote picture books; expand reading groups from the original 15 to 25. Run welfare undertakings for members: extract a part of the supply and marketing funds to set up a health center, a barbershop, and a veterinary station, and improve the busy season nursery.

III

The Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team in Erdaogou also formulated a production plan for 1952.

The Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team has a total of 13 households and 69 people; 10 male laborers, 2 semi-laborers; 8 female laborers, 9 semi-laborers. There are 9 heads of livestock, 15.72 hectares of paddy fields, and 4.5 hectares of dry land. Their plan is as follows:

(1) For 15.72 hectares of paddy fields, strive to increase production by 1 shi per hectare in 1952 (the perennial yield is 25 shi per hectare), and harvest 108,000 jin of rice. In order to achieve this production increase plan, it is necessary to: 1. Select seeds and raise seedlings, and sprinkle sand in the seedling pond to protect the seedlings from being blown into piles by the wind; 2. Apply an average of more than 35 carts of fertilizer per hectare; 3. Reduce field ridges and expand the paddy field area by 3.5 mu; 4. Achieve straight planting, without missing seedlings or empty land, and plant soybeans on the field ridges. Weed three times and pull out barnyard grass once.

(2) For dry land, plant "Man Cang Jin" soybeans on 2 hectares, sunflowers on 1 hectare, and vegetables on 1.5 hectares; which can produce 6,000 jin of soybeans, 4,000 jin of sunflowers, and enough vegetables for themselves. Achieve dedicated personnel responsible, hoe three times, harrow three times, and break down big clumps of grass once; apply seedling fertilizer to sunflowers.

(3) Organize sideline production: 1. Organize 14 straw bag machines, weave 3,000 straw bags before spring plowing, and 1,500 bags after autumn, for a total of 4,500 bags. 2. Raise 17 pigs before May, increase by 20 before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and increase by another 23 at the end of the year, for a total of 60 pigs; eat 10 pigs themselves, sell 50 pigs, and increase income by 22.5 million yuan.

The total production value for the year is 101.28 million yuan, equivalent to 168.8 tons of sorghum. The mutual aid team implements a work-point scoring system, with appropriate division of labor for men, women, old, and young.

The Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team also formulated such a consumption plan:

(1) Eat 22,000 jin of rice and 30 shi of millet throughout the year, totaling 19.52 million yuan.

(2) Pay 21,000 jin of rice and 2,600 jin of sorghum for agricultural tax, equivalent to 12.54 million yuan.

(3) Cattle eat 6,000 jin and pigs eat 16,000 jin, totaling 22,000 jin, equivalent to 6.78 million yuan.

(4) Use 2,350 jin of rice seeds, 200 jin of soybean seeds, and sunflower seeds and vegetable seeds for planting, totaling 2.2 million yuan.

(5) Non-material expenditures are 3 million yuan.

(6) Material expenditures: 1,000 jin of fertilizer, 1 cart, 2,760 chi of cloth, 50 pairs of rubber shoes, 1,500 jin of salt, 200 jin of wine, 200 jin of flour, 300 jin of soybean oil, and 1.5 million yuan for medical expenses.

The total income of the whole group for the year is 101.28 million yuan, the expenditure is 73.12 million yuan, and the remaining 28.16 million yuan will be used as a fund for expanding production in the coming year.

IV

In order to closely combine the Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Xue Yunhu Mutual Aid Team, so that the mutual aid team can achieve planned production and consumption, and the cooperative can realize planned operation, the two parties signed a "combination contract," proposing the following conditions to be jointly observed:

(1) The cooperative shall give priority to mutual aid teams in supplying materials, promoting high-quality seeds and high-quality livestock breeds, and selling unsalable local products.

(2) When mutual aid teams have urgent needs in production or other aspects, the credit department should give priority to loans.

(3) The cooperative's cultural and health undertakings should give priority to taking care of mutual aid teams. In order to ensure the health of the livestock of the mutual aid team, the cooperative's veterinary station will give priority to treatment.

(4) When mutual aid teams sell agricultural and sideline products and purchase living and production materials, they should sell and supply through the cooperative under fair and reasonable prices.

(5) In order to ensure timely supply and sales, and to enable the mutual aid team to produce with peace of mind, the mutual aid team shall submit to the cooperative in the middle of each month the plan for the needed materials and the plan for selling products for the next month, and sign a specific implementation contract for the supply and sales of major materials.

(6) Mutual aid teams shall mutually adjust and solve difficulties in economy. After meeting the needs of the team, if there is surplus funds, they shall invest in the cooperative, deposit in the credit department, or invest in livestock production, and store and accumulate funds on the condition of preserving capital and benefiting from interest, laying the foundation for expanding reproduction.

(7) The cooperative shall help the mutual aid team make plans and participate in the mutual aid team's meetings, discuss work with each other, so as to understand the production and consumption situation within the team in a timely manner, and help the mutual aid team solve specific difficulties.

(8) The mutual aid team shall frequently provide positive suggestions for the work of the cooperative and reflect the demands of the team members. Mutual aid team members shall cherish the property of the cooperative.

(9) This "combination contract" shall be earnestly observed and implemented by both parties. Those who implement it well shall be commended or rewarded.

    吉林省永吉县二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组的一九五二年计划及其所订合同
                              吉林省永吉县合作社联合社
    编者按：二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组的计划，都很切实具体，结合密切，并用合同形式把两者的供销责任确定下来；这是中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定第三部分第二项的具体执行。认真地执行合同、完成计划，必然会使两者都向前发展一步。这个办法是各地都可以大力推行的。
    按照供销合作社的性质，它应当集中力量为社员作好贸易工作，它不应当有农园、种畜站的设置和领导互助组等职能。但是，基于具体的历史条件，它这样作了，并且起了作用，这是好的。今后为了使供销合作社很好地发展，同时为了把农业生产互助组提高为农业生产合作社，应该把农园和种畜站有计划有步骤地拨归农业生产互助组或农业生产合作社，并把现在两者之间的领导关系改变为供销合同关系。在银行业务还没有开展到乡村的地方，供销合作社的信用部可以暂时保存。但必须把它的资金和供销合作社的资金划清界限，不能混淆起来。
    一            
    一九四八年永吉县二道沟村结束了土地改革，农民分到了土地；但因为“底子太空”，农民的生活和生产仍很困难。虽然组织起了互助组，但后来因为领导力量薄弱又垮了。一九四九年冬，共产党支部为响应“组织起来”的号召，决定首先搞起供销合作社来。当时农民无钱入股，于是支部就号召并组织农民上山采葡萄、榛子，搞副业，变冬闲为冬忙。这样解决了缺少股金的问题。经过这一段摸索，合作社主任刘芳找出了两条道理：一是合作社要想发展壮大，必须搞好生产，提高农民购买力；二是要想搞好生产必须组织起来。
    两年来，二道沟供销合作社迅速地发展起来了，不但组织起全村百分之九十五的人口，并且还扶持和领导了五十七个农业生产互助组（其中二十个互助组成为长期巩固的，五个被选为全县模范组）；办了一个农园、一个种畜站、一个信用部、一个农忙托儿所和一个流动图书组。
    为什么二道沟供销合作社能够迅速地发展壮大，带动了农业生产，成为一个好的合作社呢？
    首先，二道沟供销合作社的业务方针是注意为生产服务，是从农民生产需要出发的。两年间，合作社贷给互助组七千一百四十三万元，帮助互助组买牲畜四十九头、大车八辆、草袋机两台、各种经济作物籽种八千五百斤。
    一九五一年春天，政府号召多种经济作物，合作社就积极地采购了棉、麻、大豆等优良籽种供应农民，使全村比一九五○年多种大豆五十一垧、洋麻十二垧、大麻籽六垧和向日葵十三垧。
    农忙时，合作社从公积金中抽出一百万元，开办了农忙托儿所，每天收容十二、三个小孩，使十五个劳动妇女得以安心地参加生产，解决了一部分革命烈士家属和革命军人家属劳力不足的困难。
    同时合作社还办起了农园，饲养“巴克夏”种猪两口、蜂六箱、洋兔九只、种马一匹，培育果苗二十八万株和试养“二把剪子”柞蚕；计划在两年内改良全村猪种，五年内改良全村马种，六年以后培育出公有的果林。
    其次，二道沟供销合作社采取了和互助组相结合的方针。两年来合作社贷给互助组的款占信用部贷款总额的百分之六十九。在供应业务、信用贷款、推销产品、交配牲畜、推广优良籽种上，都给互助组以优先权，以奖励“组织起来”。合作社还帮助互助组订立生产计划，帮助互助组解决生产上的具体困难。如一九五一年帮助梁凤山、徐永和两个长年互助组购买了马匹，解决了他们春耕的困难。同时，合作社还把自己的供销计划和互助组的生产、推销、消费计划结合起来，增强了业务经营的计划性。
    通过一系列对互助组扶助的具体事实，显示出了互助组和供销合作社结合起来的优越性，给单干的农民以很大的刺激和教育，使他们体味到组织起来的好处。全村的互助组一九五○年春有十三个，现在已发展到五十七个，把全村劳动力的三分之二都组织起来了。
    此外，二道沟供销合作社也很注意对于农民和社员的文化教育工作。在合作社领导下成立了十五个读报小组，购置了二百八十多本连环图画和图书流动阅览，提高了互助组、合作社社员对组织起来走向社会主义远景的认识，加强了集体生产的宣传教育。
    二
    为使今年的工作做得更好，二道沟供销合作社订立了一九五二年工作计划，要点是：
    （一）在一九五一年的基础上继续巩固已有的互助组，再发展十三个互助组，使全村百分之八十的农户和百分之六十八的劳动力组织起来。
    帮助互助组订立生产和消费计划，签订供销合同，按月订销货单，使互助组的生产和消费不发生困难。 （二）供应三万斤“满仓金”大豆种、一千六百斤洋麻种、可种植十三垧地的向日葵种，使全村都使用优良品种。此外并供应大车、马匹、肥料、小农具等生产资料，保证每亩地增产七升粮。
    动员社员发展副业：推广优良种猪，打草袋子，以及其它副业，争取全年副业生产总值达四亿六千一百三十三万元。（三）签订合作社与互助组的“结合合同”，以加强业务经营的计划性。争取全年资金周转十五点五次，较一九五一年提高四点八次；全年可节省三千八百七十八万元。
    实行费用定额，加强进销货计划性，减少商品流转环节，订立运输合同。把直接费用由一九五一年的百分之三点八七降低到百分之三点一六，间接费用由一九五一年的百分之一点零五降低到百分之零点八九；全年由直接间接费用中节省一千七百九十三万元。
    （四）改善运输包装，减少库存。粮食以互助组为单位集中，争取运输中“不落地”，减少损耗，商品损耗量由一九五一年的平均百分之○点八四降低到百分之○点五（以金额计算），全年节省七百零七万元。
    （五）扩大商品供应，满足社员需要。货品由四百五十种，扩大到六百种以上。
    （六）加强学习，发挥工作的积极性，提高工作效率。一九五一年每人平均工作量为一亿二千三百九十二万元，一九五二年提高到一亿六千六百三十二万元。全年节省一千零五十一万元。
    农忙时实行送货下乡，便利生产，变淡月为旺月。
    （七）发展农园和种畜站，在合作社领导下再成立一个牧畜组。二月份开始吸收余资入股，计划吸收股金一千五百万元至二千万元；可买牛犊五十至六十头。
    （八）发展存实，实行“有啥存啥”，帮助社员推销滞销土产副产品，争取一九五二年全年存实达一亿元。
    （九）开展文化教育工作：继续推广连环图画；读报小组由原十五个发展到二十五个。举办社员福利事业：抽出一部供销资金，设立卫生所、理发所、兽医所各一处，把农忙托儿所更健全起来。
    三
    二道沟薛云虎互助组也订立了一九五二年生产计划。
    薛云虎互助组全组十三户，六十九口人；男劳动力十个，半劳动力二个；女劳动力八个，半劳动力九个。有牲畜九头，水田十五点七二垧，旱田四点五垧。他们的计划如下：
    （一）水田十五点七二垧，争取一九五二年每垧增产一石（常年每垧产二十五石），收稻子十万八千斤。为了实现这一增产计划，要作到：1、选种育苗，育苗池里撒砂子，保苗不受风刮归堆；2、每垧平均上粪超过三十五车；3、减少地埂子，扩大水田面积三亩五分；4、作到直行栽，不缺苗、不空地，地埂子上种大豆。耨三遍，拔一遍稗子。
    （二）旱田，种“满仓金”大豆二垧、向日葵一垧、蔬菜一垧半；可产大豆六千斤、向日葵四千斤、蔬菜够自己吃。作到专人负责，三铲、三趟、刹一遍大草；向日葵上苗粪。
    （三）组织副业生产：1、组织草袋机十四台，春耕前织草袋子三千条，秋后织一千五百条，共织四千五百条。2、五月前喂猪十七口，八月节前增加二十口，年末再增喂二十三口，共喂六十口；自己吃十口，卖五十口，增加收入二千二百五十万元。
    以上全年生产总值共为一亿零一百二十八万元，折合高粮一百六十八点八吨。互助组实行记工评分制，男、女、老、少适当分工。
    薛云虎互助组也订立了这样一个消费计划：
    （一）全年吃稻子二万二千斤、小米三十石，共合一千九百五十二万元。
    （二）农业税交稻子二万一千斤、高粮二千六百斤，折钱一千二百五十四万元。
    （三）牛吃六千斤，猪吃一万六千斤，共二万二千斤，折钱六百七十八万元。
    （四）种地用稻种二千三百五十斤，大豆种二百斤，及向日葵籽、菜籽共折合二百二十万元。
    （五）非物资支出三百万元。
    （六）物资支出：肥料一千斤、大车一台、布二千七百六十尺、胶鞋五十双、盐一千五百斤、酒二百斤、面二百斤、豆油三百斤、医药费一百五十万元。
    全年全组共收入一亿零一百二十八万元，支出七千三百一十二万元，剩余二千八百一十六万元，作为下一年扩大生产的基金。
    四
    二道沟供销合作社和薛云虎互助组为了密切结合，使互助组达到有计划地生产和消费，合作社实现有计划地经营，双方签订了“结合合同”，提出以下条件，共同遵守：
    （一）合作社在供应物资、推广优良籽种和优良畜种以及推销滞销土产品上，对互助组给以优先权。
    （二）互助组在生产上或其他方面有紧急需要时，信用部应优先给以贷款。
    （三）合作社的文化、卫生等事业，对互助组得优先照顾。为了保证互助组牲畜健康，合作社兽医所优先给予治疗。
    （四）互助组在推销农业副业产品和购买生活、生产资料时，在价格公平合理的情况下，要通过合作社推销和供应。
    （五）为了保证供应和推销及时，使互助组安心生产，互助组每月中旬向合作社提出下月的需要物资定货计划和推销产品计划，并对主要物资的供销签订具体执行合同。
    （六）互助组在经济上互相调剂解决困难，在满足本组需要以后有剩余资金时，要在合作社入股，存入信用部，或投入牧畜生产，以保本有利为条件储存积累资金，打下扩大再生产的基础。
    （七）合作社要帮助互助组作计划和参加互助组会议，互相商讨工作，以便及时了解组内生产和消费情况，帮助互助组解决具体困难。
    （八）互助组要对合作社工作经常提供积极的建议，并反映组员的要求。互助组员要爱护合作社的财产。
    （九）这个“结合合同”，双方应该认真遵守执行。执行得好的，要受到表扬或奖励。
