Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: The shortage of U.S. Air Force reserves and the low morale of active-duty Air Force officers and men have caused serious difficulties for the U.S. military expansion and war preparation plan.

U.S. Air Force Secretary Finletter admitted while testifying before Congress on the 16th that the Air Force Department is now finding it difficult to obtain qualified flight personnel. A news dispatch from the Guoxin News Agency on the 16th mentioned that "flying personnel at many U.S. bases are refusing to fly and are staging 'sit-down strikes'," and stated: "Air Force Secretary Finletter warned the Senate Armed Services Committee not to 'rashly' suggest reducing flight allowances, because even with 'incentive' salaries, it is now difficult to recruit pilots." According to a report by the Guoxin News Agency, Finletter also said: The Air Force Department wants to recruit a large number of qualified people to train flight personnel, but is now "at a loss" and cannot recruit a sufficient number. He said that the Air Force's reserve manpower has been "gradually depleted." Of the 6,700 students in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps graduating from universities this summer, only 1,800 "expressed interest in flight training," and only 750 of them are physically qualified. Agence France-Presse commented, in its report on the current manpower difficulties of the U.S. Air Force, that this is a first in American military aviation history.

Under these circumstances, the U.S. Air Force Department has been forced to conscript U.S. pilots from World War II back into service. This measure has aroused fierce opposition from reserve officers, and many Air Force officers have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's war preparation policy. Some Air Force officers at Air Force bases have simply refused to fly. Recently, incidents of refusal to fly have occurred at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, Lanier Firth Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base in California, and others. When reporting on the refusal to fly by six lieutenants at Randolph Air Force Base, the Associated Press quoted an official statement from the U.S. Air Force Department saying: "Only six people are involved in this 'strike,' but there are many others who have requested voluntary cessation of flight duties."

At the same time, the morale of active-duty Air Force personnel is also extremely low. According to a report by the United Press, the U.S. Scott Training Command revealed that since January 1951, 225 Air Force pilots have requested to be relieved of flight duties because of "fear of flying." In addition, 80 pilots have requested resignation because they believe that "flying has no future" and "want to go back to living as ordinary citizens."

    美国现役空军人员士气低沉
    空军部承认很难招募飞行员
    【新华社二十二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国空军后备人员的缺乏和现役空军官兵士气的低沉，已使美国扩军备战计划遭受严重困难。
    美国空军部长芬立脱十六日在国会作证时承认，空军部现在很难得到合格的飞行人员。国新社十六日消息提到“美国许多基地的飞行人员拒绝飞行，实行‘静坐罢工’”，并说：“空军部长芬立脱警告参议院军备委员会说，不要‘轻率地’建议减少飞行津贴了，因为现在甚至利用‘刺激’薪水，也很难招募到飞行员了。”据国新社报道，芬立脱又说：空军部要招募大批合格的人来训练飞行人员，但是现在“一筹莫展”，招募不到足够的数目。他说，空军后备人力已“渐渐耗竭殆尽”。今年夏天大学毕业的空军后备军官训练团的总共六千七百名学生中，只有一千八百人“表示对飞行训练感到兴趣”，而其中体力合格的只七百五十人。法新社在报道美国空军当前人力的困难时评论说，这还是美国军事航空史上第一次。
    在这种情形下，美国空军部不得不强迫徵召第二次大战时的美国飞行员复役。这种措施引起了后备军官的激烈反对，许多空军军官对美国政府的这种备战政策表示不满。有些空军基地的空军军官干脆拒绝飞行。最近在得克萨斯州兰达尔福空军基地、兰尼尔弗·菲尔姆空军基地、加利福尼亚州马瑟尔空军基地等等都曾有拒绝飞行的事件发生。美联社在报道兰道夫空军基地六名中尉拒绝飞行的事情时，引美国空军部官方声明说：“这次‘罢工’的只有六个人，但是还有许多别的人要求自愿停止飞行。”
    同时，现役空军人员的士气也极为低沉。据合众社消息，美国斯葛特教导司令部透露，自一九五一年一月以来，已有二百二十五名空军飞行员因为“害怕飞行”，请求停止飞行职务。另外还有八十名飞行员要求退职，因为认为“飞行没有前途”，“想回去过老百姓生活”。
