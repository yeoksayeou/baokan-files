    Leading Cadres of the Nine District Cooperative of Beijing Municipality
    Examine the Mistaken Viewpoint of Neglecting Politics
    Editor: The People's Daily published Comrade Deng Shiquan's letter on March 29th, pointing out the erroneous tendency of "emphasizing business, neglecting politics" among our cooperative's staff. This criticism is correct. We believe that the reason for this tendency is mainly that leading cadres have a serious purely business viewpoint and are trapped in the mire of事務ism. We think that "as long as business is done well, it doesn't matter much if learning is a bit weak." Therefore, we ourselves belittle political study and are even more unconcerned about the cadres' current affairs and political study. It is true that the general business cadres have a low level of education and have many difficulties in studying the newspapers, and some people are not very interested in political study; but the leadership has not tried to solve the difficulties and carry out current affairs and political education for them, which is an important reason for the phenomenon of neglecting reading the newspaper. Therefore, our study here has always been spontaneous.
    In order to reverse this mistaken tendency of neglecting reading the newspaper, we first examined the leadership's thinking of belittling political study and realized the importance of reading and studying the newspaper; and decided to immediately correct this shortcoming. We have decided to establish a study committee, establish a regular and frequent newspaper reading and study system, and form the cadres of each distribution point into study groups by region, each group being tutored by someone sent by the district cooperative; conducting two planned current affairs and political studies every week, and a monthly test, and publishing the results of the test to encourage the cadres' learning enthusiasm.

### 北京市九区联社领导干部  检查忽视政治的错误观点

    北京市九区联社领导干部
    检查忽视政治的错误观点
    编辑同志：三月二十九日人民日报刊载了邓士铨同志的来信，指出我社工作人员“重业务、轻政治”的错误倾向，这一批评是正确的。我们认为造成这种倾向的原因，主要是领导干部存在着严重的单纯业务观点，陷于事务主义的泥坑。我们认为“只要搞好业务就行，学习差一些没有多大关系”。因此，自己轻视政治学习，对干部的时事政治学习更是不关心的。一般业务干部的文化水平较低，学习报纸多有困难，有些人对政治学习不大感兴趣，这都是事实；但是领导方面没有设法解决困难，对他们进行时事政治教育，却是造成忽视读报现象的重要原因。因此，我们这里的学习一直是自流的。
    为了扭转这种忽视读报的错误倾向，我们首先从领导方面检讨了轻视政治学习的思想，认识了读报学习的重要性；并且决定立即纠正这一缺点。我们已决定成立学习委员会，建立正规的经常的读报学习制度，把各分销处的干部按地区组成学习小组，各组都由区联社派人辅导；每星期进行两次有计划的时事和政治学习，每月测验一次，并将测验的结果公布，以鼓励干部的学习情绪。
    北京市九区联社主任  耿江
