    Commercial Press's Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in the Book "Chinese Grammar Theory"
    Editor: We have read Comrade Gu Jingchang's letter published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 9th, criticizing the book "Chinese Grammar Theory" published by our press for containing incorrect examples. This criticism is correct. We are actively working to rectify these errors. The primary reason for these serious errors is the inadequate organization within our press. Last year, the editorial work was divided between Beijing and Shanghai, and a rigorous and responsible editorial system was not established. We did not pay enough attention to our publications and should conduct a thorough self-criticism. Since December of last year, we have implemented new regulations and strictly enforce the editorial system to prevent similar errors from occurring in the future.

    商务印书馆对“中国语法理论”一书发生错误的检讨
    编辑同志：我们读了四月九日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载的顾景常同志的来信，批评我馆出版的“中国语法理论”一书举例错误，这个批评是对的。我们已积极设法纠正。发生这种严重错误的原因，主要是由于我馆的组织太不健全。我馆去年的编审工作，分在北京、上海两地进行；认真负责的编审制度又没有建立起来。我们对出版物重视不够，应当深刻检讨。从去年十二月起，我们已作了新的规定，严格执行编审的制度，以防止今后发生同类的错误。
