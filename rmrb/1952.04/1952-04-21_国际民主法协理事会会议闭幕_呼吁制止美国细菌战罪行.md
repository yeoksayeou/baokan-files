Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 20th: The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has completed its work. The meeting unanimously adopted resolutions on the reports it heard, as well as an appeal to legal workers of the world, a letter to the United Nations Security Council, and a letter to the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

    To Legal Workers of the World,

    Dear Colleagues,

    In view of the repeated solemn accusations by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the planned violation of the laws of war by the armies that have been and are still conducting hostile actions within the territory of the Republic, our association dispatched an investigation team to Korea and authorized this investigation team to investigate on-site whether the facts presented are correct.

    The glorious duty of us legal workers is precisely to determine the meaning of the law and the meaning of illegal acts, to expose criminals or to defend the accused, and, if the accused is proven guilty, to punish them; in fulfilling all these duties, we act entirely in the interests of truth and justice, in accordance with our conscience and our inner convictions.

    In conducting our activities, we must not limit the scope of our mission because of cooperation with scientific experts, nor can we shirk our responsibilities.

    Based on these universally recognized principles, the members of our investigation team set out for Korea.

    While the investigation team was still en route, the scope of its mission was expanded. The Chinese government, along with the Korean government, made new accusations, saying that bacteriological weapons were used in the territories of Korea and China. After returning, the investigation team submitted two reports to the association, and we are forwarding these reports to you for your attention.

    We unanimously believe that, after studying these reports, there is no doubt that the armies fighting in Korea under the command of the U.S. command are engaging in acts that should be identified as crimes.

    In the current state of international law, we do not know of any judicial body to which we can submit these facts in the form of an accusation. In our view, the correctness of these facts has been confirmed by these reports.

    Please allow this association to submit these reports to you and request that you study these reports with all the seriousness and prudence you possess in performing our common profession.

    We hope that other legal workers and scientists will continue the investigations of our investigation team. We believe that they will conduct this work with the same seriousness and prudence, and we believe that they will not reach other conclusions.

    Therefore, we welcome the initiative of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, which decided at its Oslo meeting to organize its own investigation team to collect scientific materials on-site with the help of renowned experts. We preemptively declare our support for all impartial similar measures, and we believe that these measures will surely have great effect.

    We believe that the countries fighting in Korea under U.S. command, as well as the countries colluding with the United States through military agreements, should be held responsible for the actions of the command to which they voluntarily adhere.

    As our association is increasingly concerned with upholding the law and striving to protect all nations as soon as possible from such crimes—crimes which, according to the Nuremberg Tribunal's verdict, must be considered war crimes and crimes against humanity—it has issued an appeal to the Security Council, the highest authority of the United Nations.

    But we believe that the highest court to which we expect to appeal for justice and provide assistance is the conscience of the world, and faced with the same crimes, the conscience of the world must express indignation and contempt.

    Dear Colleagues, our duty is to express this world conscience demanding truth and justice. The law in our hands must become a torch, forcing evil to retreat.

    We appeal to you with full confidence, believing that you will recognize the great task before you, believing that you will shoulder all difficulties, and courageously overcome all difficulties with us.

    The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers

    Appeal to the United Nations Security Council

    For months, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been accusing the American army of war crimes committed on more than one occasion. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers sent an investigation team of legal workers there to investigate these accusations. From March 3 to April 2, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team conducted investigations first in Korea and then in China. Fully aware of its responsibilities, the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers studied the report of the investigation team. After careful study of the evidence listed in the report, the council voluntarily revealed once again the vile nature of the crimes already pointed out in the Nuremberg verdicts.

    After studying all the materials, the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers specifically declares that the facts revealed by the investigation team prove that the heinous crimes being committed by the American army are not only directed against the Korean army, but also against the civilians of Korea.

    Specifically, these crimes are: the use of chemical weapons, indiscriminate massacres, torture and atrocities, the massacre of civilians, air raids on peaceful residents, looting and destruction of property and precious works of art, and, in particular, the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers recalls that the use of bacteriological weapons is prohibited by the laws of war, and this prohibition has been stipulated by the Geneva Protocol of 1925.

    The use of bacteriological weapons is not only the most serious crime against humanity, but also a huge danger to mankind.

    As legal workers, we protest against violations of international law.

    As people, we speak of this threat to residents around the world and express our indignation at the use of scientific achievements for colonial purposes.

    We recommend that the Security Council: (1) immediately consider the report of our investigation team, as well as any other evidence regarding germ warfare, regarding other facts that have been discovered, regarding the manufacture of germ weapons and the preparation for the use of germ weapons.

    (2) Hasten to take the necessary measures to stop the crimes committed by the American army, which directly threaten peace and international security.

    We request that the Security Council forward our appeal to all member states of the United Nations.

    Appeal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission

    The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers agrees with the conclusions of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, which conducted a thorough investigation into the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the American army in Korea and China, particularly the use of bacteriological weapons.

    After conducting a thorough investigation (the results of which are contained in a detailed report), the gravity of the facts listed has prompted the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to firmly demand an effective prohibition of bacteriological weapons, which are already prohibited by international law.

    The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers believes that the most urgent task of the United Nations Disarmament Commission is to urge all United Nations member states to ratify the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925.

    The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers requests that the United Nations Disarmament Commission take effective practical measures to prohibit weapons of mass destruction, including the atomic bomb, and to supervise the implementation of such prohibition measures.

    Only by resolutely embarking on disarmament—first by immediately taking disarmament measures—can international security and peace be guaranteed.

    All countries must learn from the shocking suffering of the Korean people. The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers calls on the United Nations Disarmament Commission to find ways to free the world from such suffering.

    国际民主法协理事会会议闭幕
    呼吁制止美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十日讯：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议完成了它的工作。会议一致通过了关于它所听取的各项报告的决议，以及告世界法律工作者书、致联合国安全理事会书和致联合国裁减军备委员会书。
    告世界法律工作者书亲爱的同业们：
    鉴于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一再对曾经而且仍然在该共和国境内进行敌对行动的军队有计划地破坏战争法的行为提出郑重的控诉，我协会曾派遣调查团赴朝鲜，并授权这个调查团在现场调查所提出的事实是否正确。
    我们法律工作者的光荣的职责，正是确定法律的意义和犯法行为的意义、揭露犯罪者或为被告辩护、如果被告证实确属有罪，即予以惩罚；我们在履行这一切职责的时候，完全本着真理和公义的利益，本着我们的良心和我们内心的信念。
    我们在进行活动的时候，不能因为与科学专家的合作而就限制我们的任务的范围，也不能推卸我们的责任。
    本着这些人所公认的原则，我们调查团的团员们出发到朝鲜去。
    当调查团还在途中的时候，它的任务范围又扩大了。中国政府与朝鲜政府提出新的指责，说在朝鲜和中国领土上使用了细菌武器。调查团回来后，向协会提出了两个报告，我们就把这两件报告转请你们予以注意。
    我们一致认为：研究过这些报告以后，已毫无疑问，由美国司令部指挥的在朝鲜作战的军队，正在进行应该认定为是罪行的行为。
    在目前国际法的情形下，我们不知道我们有什么司法机构使我们可以把这些事实以控诉的形式向它提出，在我们看来，这些事实的正确性已由这些报告证实了。
    请允许本协会把这些报告提交给你们，并请求你们用你们在执行我们共同的职业时所具有的一切严肃与审慎的态度来研究这些报告。
    我们希望其他的法律工作者与科学家能够继续我们调查团的调查工作。我们相信：他们一定会以同样严肃与审慎的态度来进行这个工作，同时相信他们决不会得出其他的结论。
    因此，我们对世界和平理事会执行局的倡议表示欢迎，该执行局在其奥斯陆会议上决定组织自己的调查团，以便在著名的专家帮助下实地搜集科学的材料。我们预先声明赞成一切大公无私的类似措施，我们认为：这些措施一定可以发挥很大的效果。
    我们认为：在美国指挥下在朝鲜作战的各国以及用军事协定与美国勾结在一起的各国，应该对它们自愿依附的司令部的行动负责。
    我协会越来越关切维护法律，并力求尽速保障各国人民不受这样的罪行的侵害——这种罪行，根据纽伦堡法庭的判决，必定要被认为是战争罪和反人类罪——因此，向联合国的最高权力机关安全理事会发出了呼吁。
    可是我们认为：我们期望申张公义并提供援助的最高法院，是全世界的良心，面临着同样的罪行，全世界的良心必须表示忿怒和轻蔑。
    亲爱的同业们，我们的职责是说明这种要求真理和公义的世界的良心。掌握在我们手中的法律，必须成为火炬，迫使罪恶后退。
    我们满怀着信心，向你们发出呼吁，相信你们必会认识到你们面前的伟大任务，相信你们必会肩负起一切困难，并满怀勇气地和我们一起战胜一切困难。
    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会
    普里特（签名）
    致联合国安全理事会的呼吁书
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府数月来一直在指责美军所犯的不止一次的战争罪行。国际民主法律工作者协会派了一个由法律工作者组成的调查团到那里去调查这些指责。从三月三日到四月二日，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团先在朝鲜、后在中国进行了调查。国际民主法律工作者协会理事会充分意识到它的责任，研究了该调查团的报告。仔细研究了报告中列举的证据，并且自愿再一次揭露纽伦堡判决中已经指出了其卑鄙性质的罪行。
    在研究了全部材料后，国际民主法律工作者协会理事会特声明，调查团所揭露的这些事实证明，美军正在进行的滔天罪行不仅是针对着朝鲜军队，而且是针对着朝鲜的平民的。
    具体说来，这些罪行就是：使用化学武器，不分皂白的屠杀、拷打和暴行，屠杀平民，空袭和平居民，抢掠和破坏财物和贵重的艺术品，特别应该强调的是在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。
    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会记起，使用细菌武器是战争法规所禁止的，这种禁止已被一九二五年的日内瓦议定书规定下来。
    使用细菌武器不仅是反人类的最严重的罪行，而且是对人类的一个巨大的危险。
    我们以法律工作者的身份抗议违反国际法的行为。
    我们以人民的身份谈到这种对全世界居民的威胁，并对把科学成就用于殖民目的一事表示愤慨。
    我们建议安理会：（一）立即考虑我们调查团的报告，以及关于细菌战、关于其他已经发现的事实、关于制造细菌武器和准备使用细菌武器的任何其他的证据。
    （二）赶紧采取必要的措施，制止美军所犯的、直接威胁着和平与国际安全的罪行。
    我们要求安理会把我们的呼吁书转达给联合国所有的会员国。
    致联合国裁减军备委员会的呼吁书
    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议同意曾在朝鲜和中国对美国军队所犯的战争罪行和反人类的罪行、特别是使用细菌武器的行为进行过彻底调查的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团所作的结论。
    在进行了彻底的调查（调查的结果已载入详细的报告）以后，列举的事实的严重性促使国际民主法律工作者协会理事会坚决要求有效地禁止已为国际法所禁止的细菌武器。
    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议认为，联合国裁减军备委员会的最迫切的任务是促使所有联合国会员国批准一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。
    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议要求联合国裁减军备委员会采取有效的实际措施，以禁止包括原子弹在内的用于大规模毁灭的武器，并监督执行这种禁止措施。
    只有坚决着手裁减军备——首先是立即采取裁减军备的措施，国际安全与和平才能得到保障。
    一切国家必须把朝鲜人民遭受的惊人的苦难引为教训。国际民主法律工作者协会理事会要求联合国裁减军备委员会设法把全世界从这种苦难中解救出来。
