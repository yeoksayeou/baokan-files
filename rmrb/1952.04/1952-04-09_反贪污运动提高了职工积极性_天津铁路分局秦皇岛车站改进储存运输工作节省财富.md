To the Editor: The employees of Qinhuangdao Station of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau, educated by the great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, have greatly increased their enthusiasm for work. They have come up with ways to improve cargo storage and transportation, saving the country a lot of wealth.

    According to past practice, all imported goods had to be stored in the dock warehouse first, and it would take at least a month for the import company, customs, trade and other departments to complete the allocation procedures. Not only that, but a lot of expenses were incurred in the middle, such as loading and unloading, warehouse rent, shunting, and covering with tarpaulins, and the damage to the goods was also great. Recently, the employees of Qinhuangdao Station of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau consulted with the Qinhuangdao Import Material Receiving Office of the China Department Store Company and asked them to complete the procedures for picking up and allocating goods before the ship arrived at the dock. After the ship arrives, the railway is responsible for promptly allocating wagons and tarpaulins (because direct loading from the ship to the train must be done with open wagons, which must be covered with tarpaulins) and directly transporting them to the respective receiving departments for selection. This reduces loading and unloading, warehouse rent, and covering with tarpaulins, and also reduces the damage rate of the goods. The results of implementing this method in March showed that only two batches (a total of 23,582 tons) of goods were transported, saving the country more than 4.25 billion yuan. I think this storage and transportation method is worth promoting.

    反贪污运动提高了职工积极性
    天津铁路分局秦皇岛车站改进储存运输工作节省财富
    编辑同志：天津市铁路分局秦皇岛车站职工，经过伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的教育，工作积极性大大提高。他们想出了改进货物储运的办法，为国家节省了大量财富。
    根据以往惯例，凡是进口物资，都必须先在码头仓库堆存，经过进口公司、海关、贸易等部门，最快要一个月才能办完调拨手续。不但如此，中间还要花费很多装卸、栈租、调车、苫垛等费用，货物的损耗也很大。天津铁路分局秦皇岛车站职工最近曾和中国百货公司秦皇岛进口物资接收处商议，请他们在货船未到码头以前，先做好提货调拨手续，船到后，由铁路负责及时拨给车皮、蓬布（因为由船向火车直接装，必须是敞车，要有蓬布苫盖），直接运往各提货部门选择，中间就减少了装卸、栈租、苫垛等手续，同时也减少了货物的损耗率。三月份按照这种办法实行的结果，只运两批（共二万三千五百八十二吨）货物，就为国家节省了四十二亿五千多万元。我认为这种储运办法是值得推广的。  天津铁路分局　贾光石
