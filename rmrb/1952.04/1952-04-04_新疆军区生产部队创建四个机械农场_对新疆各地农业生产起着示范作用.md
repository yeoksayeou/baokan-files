The Production Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has established four fully modern mechanized farms in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, setting a new banner for agricultural production in the northwest frontier of the motherland.

These four fully modernized mechanized farms are distributed along the fertile Manas River, Kaidu River, Toutun River, and the grasslands of Gandé County. The mechanized farms use "Stalin 80," "ATZ" tractors to pull five-bottom plows, twenty-four-row seeders, and other mechanical farm implements, as well as "Combine" combine harvesters for production. This year, the sowing area of each farm ranges from 6,000 mu to 20,000 mu. Each farm also adopts advanced experiences from Soviet farms and China's state-owned farms, adopting scientific management methods that combine agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry.

Since the second half of last year, these four mechanized farms have begun preparations. Now, all necessary production tools, seeds, and fertilizers have been equipped, and all necessary buildings, such as dormitories and machine rooms, have been built. The "August 1st" Mechanized Farm on the Toutun River also sowed more than 1,500 mu of winter wheat last autumn, and the farms on the Manas River and Kaidu River also sowed winter wheat. In terms of water conservancy and irrigation, all farms have renovated canals, ensuring sufficient water for irrigation even in dry conditions. Now, all farms have completed spring plowing preparations and will soon begin plowing.

Mechanized farms play a demonstrative role in Xinjiang's agricultural production. The leading organs of the Xinjiang Military Region have decided that after the land reform this year, the troops will give land to the peasants, vacate well-equipped houses, lend various modern production tools, and assist farmers of all ethnic groups in establishing ten collective farms, each with 10,000 mu of cultivated land. This spring plowing, a pilot project will be carried out in Gandé and Changji, assisting 500 households of various ethnic groups moved from the suburbs of Dihua City to establish a collective farm with 10,000 mu of cultivated land.

In addition, mechanized farms are responsible for cultivating and promoting fine varieties. For example, the "August 1st" Mechanized Farm will cultivate a large number of Ukrainian winter wheat, White Horse-tooth Corn, Black Manchurian spring wheat, Gansu Hexi millet, etc. this year; at the same time, it is also responsible for training agricultural technicians. The Xinjiang Military Region Production Committee will systematically select outstanding cadres and soldiers for rotational training in various mechanized farms to cultivate a large number of skilled farm management cadres, tractor drivers, and "Combine" machine operators, and strive to build a rich and happy new Xinjiang.

### 新疆军区生产部队创建四个机械农场  对新疆各地农业生产起着示范作用

    新疆军区生产部队创建四个机械农场
    对新疆各地农业生产起着示范作用
    人民解放军新疆军区生产部队，在天山南北创建了四个完全现代化的机械农场，为祖国西北边疆农业生产树立了一面崭新的旗帜。
    这四个完全现代化的机械农场，分布在肥沃的玛纳斯河、开都河、头屯河畔和干德县的草原上。机械农场都是用“斯大林八十号”、“阿特兹”拖拉机曳引五体犁、二十四行播种机等各种机械农具和“康拜因”联合收割机进行生产。今年各农场播种面积为六千亩到两万亩不等。各农场并接受苏联农场和我国国营农场的先进经验，采取农业、畜牧和林业结合的科学经营方法。
    从去年下半年起，这四个机械化农场即开始筹备，现在一切必要的生产工具、籽种、肥料都已配齐，一切必要的建筑，如宿舍、机房等，都已建造。头屯河畔的“八一”机械农场在去年秋天，并已播种了冬麦一千五百余亩，玛纳斯河和开都河畔的农场也播种了冬麦。在水利灌溉方面，各个农场都已经整修了水渠，即使在干旱的情况下，也可保证有充分的水灌溉。现在各个农场都已完成春耕准备工作，不久即可开犁。
    机械农场对于新疆农业生产起着示范作用。新疆军区领导机关已决定在今年土地改革后，由部队送土地给农民，让出设备完善的房舍，借出各种现代化的生产工具，协助各族农民建立十个——每个拥有耕地一万亩的集体农庄；今年春耕时，首先在干德、昌吉试办，协助由迪化市郊移去的五百户各族农民建立一个一万亩耕地的集体农庄。
    此外，机械农场并负责培植和推广优良品种。如“八一”机械农场今年将大量培植乌克兰冬小麦、白马齿苞谷、黑芒春小麦、甘肃河西谷等；同时还负责训练农业技术人员。新疆军区生产委员会将有计划地抽调优秀的干部和战士，在各机械农场轮训，培养大批熟练的农场管理干部和拖拉机手、“康拜因”机手，为建设富饶、美满的新新疆而努力。（新华社）
