From a Feudal Old Family to a Harmonious New Family
    ——A Record of the Changes in a Hui Family in Xinjiang
    By our special correspondent Yao Wen

    Ayi Xihan is a Hui woman activist who grew up in the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement in the fourth administrative village of the first township in the fifth district of Turpan, Xinjiang Province. She is a member of the township government, the treasurer of the farmers' association committee, and the welfare member of the township women's federation. Her husband, Xima, her young son, Muse, and her daughter-in-law, Saimai, are all members of the farmers' association. If there is any gathering in the village, all four members of the family participate. Ayi Xihan often takes her daughter-in-law to participate in various activities in the village. The shouts and curses of Ayi Xihan are no longer heard in the house, nor is the weeping of the young daughter-in-law Saimai; the old man Xima and his son Muse no longer sigh and complain that there is no way to manage the affairs of the family. All four feel that there is laughter, warmth, the love of the elderly, and the respect of the son and daughter-in-law in the family. Everyone works hard and actively participates in the rural social reform movement together.
    This is a harmonious new family that is just growing.
    But four months ago, before the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement had been promoted to this village, Ayi Xihan's family was a dark and autocratic old family, and the hearts of the four people were separated and painful. The thoughts and behaviors of the feudal ruling class in feudal society had a very deep influence on this family and Ayi Xihan. At that time, Ayi Xihan, like other wicked mothers-in-law in the old society, often abused her daughter-in-law Saimai, as if she was not comfortable unless she saw her daughter-in-law crying and suffering. I visited her at her home in late November last year. She was burly (compared to the average woman), had a loud voice, looked agile, and appeared shrewish. She was an old lady who was nearly fifty years old. Every year after winter, her husband and son went to Dihua to work, and she and her daughter-in-law were busy with production at home all day long. She was a working woman who was not used to being idle. However, the masses said that she had a very bad temper. Her husband and son were afraid of her, not to mention her daughter-in-law. Saimai came to her house at the age of sixteen and has been there for almost two years. The masses have not seen Saimai go out. She often went hungry, was beaten, and suffered under the tyrannical power of her wicked mother-in-law. If she answered a word that did not suit her mother-in-law's wishes, she would be slapped in the face. According to Saimai, once she broke a bowl, Ayi Xihan took a wooden stick and beat her foot until it was swollen, and she could not walk for many days. Every meal, although she ate the leftovers of her parents-in-law, she had to wait for her mother-in-law to tell her to eat after serving her parents-in-law. Saimai's father-in-law, Xima, and husband, Muse, sympathized with her, but no one dared to say a word of justice. Two years of miserable and cold life as a daughter-in-law made the eighteen-year-old Saimai like a fool and a mute. Not only did she lose the vigor and joy that a young person should have, but she also lost her voice. After her pain was relieved, when I saw her with several female comrades, she could not speak loudly.
    When the work team of the Rent Reduction Work Group of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province first went to the fourth administrative village, Ayi Xihan's attitude had not changed at all. One day, Saimai returned from her mother's home accompanied by her own parents. As soon as she entered the door, Ayi Xihan slapped her in the face and cursed her for saying bad things at her mother's home and for staying at her sister's home for a few days. She also said to her: "You go and tell the cadres, I am not afraid, dare you do anything to me!" No matter what Saimai said, she would harshly rebuff her, and at worst, give her a few slaps in the face.
    Our work team cadres went to Ayi Xihan's home to visit, asked about her family situation, and asked if she and her daughter-in-law had attended mass meetings. Ayi Xihan answered briskly that she went to every meeting, but her daughter-in-law did not go because she did not understand the Uyghur language. But when asked about Saimai - her daughter-in-law, she did not say a word. A few days later, Saimai and her parents went to the work team cadres. Saimai's mother tearfully recounted her daughter's suffering as a daughter-in-law and asked the work team to help relieve this suffering. The work team comrades already had plans to help Saimai relieve her suffering, but Ayi Xihan's son Muse said with a skeptical tone: "I don't believe the Communist Party will have a way to educate my mother." Ayi Xihan's husband Xima also held hope, but said uncertainly: "If the Communist Party really has a way to educate her well, my family will save a lot of trouble." The old man Xima and Muse are both honest and hardworking working people, but because Ayi Xihan's mind is too feudal and she abuses her daughter-in-law, everyone's labor mood is not good. Ayi Xihan herself often gets angry and furious after scolding her daughter-in-law, which makes the four members of the family very distressed and greatly affects the harmony of the family and the enthusiasm for production.
    However, Ayi Xihan is a working woman who has been oppressed and exploited. As long as she is told the truth that the laboring people, both men and women, young and old, should unite and strive for liberation together; explain the truth that equality between men and women in the family, respect for mothers-in-law and love for daughters-in-law, democracy and unity, can lead to good production, dig out her traditional feudal thoughts, criticize her feudal behavior of abusing her daughter-in-law, and raise her class consciousness, she can be changed. Therefore, after discussion with the director of the farmers' association and women's representatives, the work team comrades convened a small mass meeting to criticize and educate Ayi Xihan. A total of seventy-two men and women from the masses participated in the meeting, and Saimai's parents were also present. After Saimai recounted her two years of suffering as a daughter-in-law at the meeting, a Hui man said: "After liberation, it is not right for Ayi Xihan to beat and scold her daughter-in-law like this. This is the reactionary style of the Kuomintang and she should admit her mistake." Then the men and women of the masses put forward opinions to Ayi Xihan such as "No beating or scolding the daughter-in-law," "Eating at the same table," and "Allowing the daughter-in-law to attend meetings and literacy classes," and asked Ayi Xihan to write them on her own guarantee. The work team comrades also told her many truths. Ayi Xihan herself admitted her mistake of abusing her daughter-in-law and guaranteed to everyone that she would change her attitude towards her daughter-in-law; the daughter-in-law Saimai also expressed that she would listen to the teachings of her parents-in-law and take the initiative to find work to do. The daughter-in-law's parents were even more excited to express to everyone that they would eliminate the past resentment towards their relatives and become relatives again. On the spot, the two families shook hands and congratulated each other, and the atmosphere of harmony and unity filled the meeting place. The men and women who attended the meeting were educated and enlightened, and they discussed: "In the future, if anyone in the family makes a mistake, we will hold a family criticism meeting to correct it. This method is very good!"
    From then on, Ayi Xihan not only became a kind mother-in-law, but also became an activist in the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement in the fourth administrative village. Her daughter-in-law Saimai gained freedom of movement, put on new cotton clothes, participated in the farmers' association and production team, and also participated in literacy learning. Ayi Xihan herself was elected as a representative of the second farmers' congress, and was also elected as the treasurer of the farmers' association committee. She was very serious and responsible for the safekeeping of the fruits of the farmers' struggle. After being elected as the welfare member of the township women's federation, she was even more enthusiastic and cautious in mediating family and marriage disputes among the masses, fearing that she would make mistakes; after doing so, she would report to Li Ling of the provincial women's federation who participated in the work team. At the same time, after the disputes were resolved, fearing that people would not implement the conditions on the guarantee, she often went to check. Ayi Xihan happily said to the work team comrades: "I can work all day without eating as long as I can do the work well; if I have any problems, you give me your opinions." When the rent reduction and anti-hegemony work was about to end, she also planned to organize Uyghur women to learn how to make cloth shoes. She said: "I, this welfare member, must seek welfare for women."
    Ayi Xihan's family has now become a democratic, harmonious and happy new family. Her son Muse believed from her actual actions in the past two months that the Communist Party was truly able to transform his mother. The whole family is grateful and said to the masses: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the cadres come to help us solve our family problems." The masses therefore praised the Communist Party even more. They said: "The Communist Party is so good that it even handles the household affairs of the common people well."

    从封建旧家庭到和睦的新家庭
    ——记新疆一个回族家庭的变化
    本报特约记者  姚文
    阿衣洗汗是新疆省吐鲁番五区一乡四行政村在减租反霸运动中成长起来的一个回族妇女积极分子，是乡政府委员、农民协会委员会保管委员、乡妇女联合会的福利委员。她的丈夫喜马，年轻的儿子木塞和儿媳赛迈都是农会的会员。假如村里有什么集会，一家四口全体参加。阿衣洗汗常常带着媳妇去参加村里的各种活动。家里再也听不到阿衣洗汗的叫骂，也听不到小媳妇赛迈的哭泣了；喜马老汉和儿子木塞，也不再唉声叹气地喊叫家里的事没有办法管了。四口人都感到家里有了欢笑，有了温暖，有了老人的慈爱，也有了儿、媳的尊敬。大家努力干活，又一同去积极参加农村的社会改革运动。
    这是一个刚在成长中的和睦的新家庭。
    可是在四个月以前，在减租反霸运动还未推进到这个村子里来的时候，阿衣洗汗的家庭，却是一个黑暗专制的旧家庭，四口人的心是分离的、苦痛的。封建社会里封建统治阶级的思想、行为，给这个家庭和阿衣洗汗的影响是非常深的。那时，阿衣洗汗就像旧社会其他的恶婆婆一样，经常虐待自己的儿媳赛迈，好像看不见媳妇的哭泣和痛苦她就不舒服似的。去年十一月下旬，我曾到她家访问过她。她身材魁梧（比起一般女人来说），话声宏亮，看起来动作利洒，显得泼辣，是一位将近五十岁的老太太。每年过了冬天，她的丈夫同儿子都到迪化去做活，她同媳妇就在家里闹生产，成天忙碌，是一个闲不惯的劳动妇女。可是，群众都说她的脾气坏得很。她的丈夫和儿子都怕她，媳妇是更不用提了。赛迈十六岁到她家，已经快两年了，群众没有看见赛迈出过门。她经常在阿衣洗汗恶婆婆的淫威之下饿肚子，挨打受气，一句话答得不合婆婆的意，就挨一顿耳光。据赛迈说，有一次她打破了一个碗，阿衣洗汗就拿上木棍打肿了她的脚，好多天不能走路；每顿饭，虽都是吃的公婆的剩饭，但还要侍候公婆吃完以后婆婆叫吃才敢吃。赛迈的公公喜马，丈夫木塞都同情她，但是谁也不敢说一句公道话。两年的悲惨冷酷的媳妇生活，使十八岁的赛迈，就像一个傻子和哑吧一样，不但失去了青年应有的生气和喜悦，而且也失去了说话的声音。在她的这种痛苦被解除以后，我同几位女同志看到她时，她还不能高声说话。
    新疆省人民政府减租工作团工作小组刚深入到四行政村的时候，阿衣洗汗的态度还毫无改变，有一天，赛迈由自己的亲生父母陪同从娘家回来，刚进门，就被阿衣洗汗打了一个耳光，并臭骂了一顿，怪她到娘家说了坏话，怪她到姐姐家去住了几天。并且对她说：“你去告诉干部，我也不怕，你敢把我怎么样！”赛迈不论说一句什么话，她都会恶狠狠地给她碰回去，再坏一点，就是给她一阵耳光。
    我们工作组的干部曾到阿衣洗汗家去访问，问她家的情况，问她同媳妇是不是去参加过群众会。阿衣洗汗利利洒洒地回答说她每次都去开会，媳妇不懂维族话才没有去。但是问到赛迈——她的媳妇，却一声不响。过了几天，赛迈同她娘家的父母亲一同去找工作组干部，赛迈的妈妈流着眼泪诉说女儿当媳妇的痛苦，要求工作组帮助解除这种痛苦。工作组同志也已经有帮助赛迈解除痛苦的打算，可是阿衣洗汗的儿子木塞用着不大相信的口吻说：“我不相信共产党会有办法把我妈教育好。”阿衣洗汗的丈夫喜马也抱着希望，但又不肯定地说：“如果共产党真有办法把她教育好的话，我家就省好多事了。”喜马老头子同木塞都是忠厚勤劳的劳动人民，但是因为阿衣洗汗的脑子太封建，虐待儿媳妇，弄得大家的劳动情绪都不好。阿衣洗汗自己呢，也常在恶骂媳妇之后还生气、发怒，弄得一家四口都很苦恼，大大影响了家庭的和睦和生产的积极性。
    不过，阿衣洗汗是一个受过压迫、受过剥削的劳动妇女，只要给她讲明劳动人民内部的男女老少应该团结和一同争取解放的道理；说明家庭男女平等，尊婆爱媳，民主团结，才能闹好生产的道理，挖掉她传统的封建思想，批评她虐待媳妇的封建行为，提高她的阶级觉悟，她是可以改变过来的。因此，工作组同志经过和农会主任、妇女代表的研究讨论，召开了一个小型的群众会议，对阿衣洗汗进行了批评教育。参加会的男女群众共七十二人，赛迈娘家的父母也在场。赛迈在会上诉说了两年媳妇生活的悲苦以后，一位回族的男人发言说：“解放以后，阿衣洗汗这样打骂媳妇是不行的，这是国民党的反动作风，应该承认错误。”接着男女群众都向阿衣洗汗提出“不许打骂媳妇”、“要同桌吃饭”、“准许媳妇开会、上识字班”等意见，要阿衣洗汗写在自己的保证书上，工作组同志也向她讲了许多道理。阿衣洗汗自己承认了对虐待媳妇的错误，向大家保证改变对媳妇的态度；媳妇赛迈也表示要听公婆的教导，自动找活做。媳妇的娘家父母更兴高采烈地向大家表示要消除过去对亲家的怨恨，重新作亲家。当场两家互相握手恭贺，会场上充满了和睦团结的空气。到会的男女群众都受到了教育和启发，议论纷纷：“以后家里不论什么人犯了错误，都开个家庭批评会来纠正，这办法可好哩！”
    从此以后，阿衣洗汗不但变成了善良的婆婆，而且成为四行政村减租反霸运动中的积极分子。她媳妇赛迈获得了行动自由，穿上了新的棉衣，参加了农会和生产小组，又参加了识字学习。阿衣洗汗本人当选为第二届农民代表会的代表，又被选为农民协会委员会的保管委员，对于农民斗争果实的保管非常认真负责。在被选为乡妇女联合会的福利委员以后，她调解群众的家庭和婚姻纠纷，更是热心而慎重，深怕做错；做过以后就找省妇联参加工作组的李玲汇报。同时，在纠纷和解以后，怕人家不实行保证书上的条件，还常去查看。阿衣洗汗愉快地对工作组同志说：“我整天工作不吃饭都行，只要能把工作做好；我有什么毛病，你们给我提意见。”在减租反霸工作快结束时，她还计划组织维吾尔族妇女学做布鞋。她说：“我这福利委员，就要为妇女谋福利。”
    阿衣洗汗的家庭，现在变为民主和睦的快乐的新家庭。她的儿子木塞，从她两月来的实际行动中相信了共产党是真正能够改造自己的母亲的。他们一家人都怀着感谢的心情对群众说：“只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，干部才能来帮助我们解决家里的问题。”群众也因此更加称颂共产党。他们说：“共产党真好，连老百姓的家务事，也给办得好好的。”
