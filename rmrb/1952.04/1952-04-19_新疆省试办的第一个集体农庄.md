Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, April 18th: The first collective farm trial in Xinjiang Province – the "Dihua Collective Farm" – was announced on February 12th. Most of those who signed up to join this collective farm were poor people from Dihua City and landless or land-poor peasants from the suburbs. By late February, the farm had more than 430 peasant households, including more than 1,300 people from Han, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, and Russian ethnic groups.

	In the vast wilderness north of Dihua City, where the collective farm is now established, there were originally no farmlands. The People's Liberation Army opened canals, reclaimed farmland, and built farmhouses here. This year, the Xinjiang Military Region donated all of the 1,200 mu of cultivated land, four canals, and well-equipped farmhouses and stables reclaimed by the People's Liberation Army to the Dihua Collective Farm without compensation. They also gave the farm 80 strong horses, 25 sets of animal-drawn farm implements and agricultural machinery, and 560 farm tools. This is the foundation for the establishment of the Dihua Collective Farm. Because of this, the land of the Dihua Collective Farm is state-owned, the means of production – farm tools, machinery, horses, etc. – are collectively owned by the farm, and the farmers of the farm participate voluntarily. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province can sign up to join this farm and become the new masters of the farm. They work collectively on the farm, and all future harvests of the farm will be distributed according to the amount of labor contributed. In order to support this farm, the Xinjiang Military Region also lent them all the rations and feed needed before this year's harvest.

	Now, more than 1,300 people of all ethnic groups have settled down on the Dihua Collective Farm. They were originally poor peasants or urban poor people with nothing, but now they have become members of a farm with a large amount of land, horses, and farm tools. They work collectively and distribute the fruits of their labor according to their work, but each household still lives its own family life according to its own ethnic customs. Now, they have elected the chairman of the farm and divided into four groups according to production needs: farming, sowing, watering, and feeding horses. In addition to handling their own daily household affairs, the women are also organized to carry out auxiliary labor such as collecting firewood and carrying grain. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has also sent four agricultural technicians to the farm to provide technical guidance, and the Dihua Municipal People's Government has sent a doctor to take charge of the farm's sanitation. Now, under the leadership of the Dihua Collective Farm Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the chairman of the farm, the farm members have begun their completely new life.

	The spring plowing of the Dihua Collective Farm has already begun. The Xinjiang Military Region helped the farm transport 80,000 catties of high-quality Black Awn Spring Wheat seeds from Tacheng and 170,000 catties of high-quality miscellaneous grain seeds from Changji. The farm members have begun their tense and happy labor. They sincerely thank the People's Government and thank Chairman Mao. They said: They will respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy with practical actions, reclaim 10,000 mu of wasteland this year, sow 2,500 mu of wheat, 7,300 mu of coarse grains and oil crops, and grow vegetables and try to grow cotton on 10 mu in the remaining land. In order to strive to complete the spring wheat sowing work as soon as possible and ensure a bumper harvest, each production team has launched a labor competition.

    新疆省试办的第一个集体农庄
    【新华社迪化十八日电】新疆省试办的第一个集体农庄——“迪化集体农庄”，已在二月十二日宣布成立。报名参加这个集体农庄的多是迪化市的贫民和市郊的无地或少地农民。到二月下旬这个农庄的农民已有四百三十多户，包括汉、回、维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、俄罗斯等民族的一千三百多人。
    在迪化市北现在建立集体农庄的地方，广袤的原野上原来是没有农田的。人民解放军在这里开了水渠，垦出农田，修盖了农舍。今年，新疆军区把人民解放军已垦出的一千二百亩耕地、四条水渠和设备完善的农舍和马厩，全部无代价地赠送给了迪化集体农庄，而且还送给农庄八十匹健马、二十五部马拉农具和农业机械、五百六十件农具。这就是迪化集体农庄建庄的基础。正因为这样，迪化集体农庄的土地是国有的，生产资料——农具、机器、马匹等是农庄公有的，农庄的农民是自愿参加的。新疆省的各族人民，都可报名参加这个农庄，成为农庄的新主人。他们在农庄集体劳动，将来农庄的一切收获按劳动多少来分配。新疆军区为扶植这个农庄，还借给他们今年收获以前所需的全部口粮和马料。
    现在，各族人民一千三百多人已经在迪化集体农庄定居下来了。他们原来都是一无所有的贫苦农民或城市贫民，现在他们都成了拥有大量土地、马匹和农具的农庄的庄员。他们集体劳动，按劳分配劳动果实，但各户仍按照自己民族的风俗习惯过自己的家庭生活。现在，他们已选出了农庄的主席，按生产需要分了耕地、播种、浇水、喂马四个组。妇女们除处理自己家中的日常生活事务外，也编组进行打柴、背粮等辅助劳动。新疆省人民政府还派了四名农业技术人员在农庄担任技术指导工作，迪化市人民政府派了一名医生担任农场的卫生工作。现在农庄庄员，在中国共产党迪化集体农庄支部和农庄主席的领导下，已开始了他们的完全新的生活。
    迪化集体农庄的春耕已经开始了。新疆军区帮助农庄从塔城运来了八万斤优良的黑芒春麦种和从昌吉运来了十七万斤优良的杂粮种，庄员们已开始了紧张愉快的劳动。他们衷心感谢人民政府，感谢毛主席。他们表示：要以实际行动响应毛主席增产节约的号召，今年开荒一万亩，播种小麦两千五百亩，五谷杂粮和油料作物七千三百多亩，其余种菜蔬并试种棉花十亩。为了争取及早完成春小麦播种工作，保证丰收，各生产小组已展开了劳动竞赛。
