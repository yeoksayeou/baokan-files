    Ample Rainfall in Most Areas in March
    Severe Drought Only in Southwestern Regions
    Rainfall in most agricultural areas of the country was abundant in March. The central and southern parts of the Central South and East China regions received the most, generally exceeding 100 millimeters (100 millimeters equals 3 *shi* inches). The central part of Hunan, most of Jiangxi and Zhejiang were above 200 millimeters. The average total rainfall in March in North China and Northeast China was 10 to 20 millimeters, slightly more than in the same month in previous years, which greatly helped spring plowing and sowing. Although the rainfall in March in the four provinces of Rehe, Western Liaoning, Eastern Liaoning, and Shandong was slightly less than in the same month in previous years, the difference was very limited. The rainfall in various parts of the Southwest region in March was generally below 25 millimeters, only about half of the normal year, and the drought was relatively severe. The People's Governments at all levels in the Southwest are now vigorously leading farmers to fight drought and carry out spring plowing. In the Northwest region, except for Shaanxi and southeastern Gansu which exceeded 10 millimeters, rainfall and snowfall in the vast area were insufficient; however, the arable land in this area mainly relies on snowmelt from high mountains for irrigation, so the impact is not significant.

    三月份大部地区雨量充沛
    只有西南各地旱象比较严重
    三月份全国大部农业地区雨量都较充沛，中南和华东两区的中部和南部最多，一般都超过一百公厘（一百公厘等于三市寸）。湖南中部，江西和浙江大部分地方，在二百公厘以上。华北和东北各地三月份总雨量平均十公厘到二十公厘，比往年同月份稍多，这对春耕播种大有帮助。热河、辽西、辽东和山东四省三月份的雨量虽然比往年同月份略少，不过相差很有限。西南区各地三月份雨量普遍都在二十五公厘以下，大约只有平常年份的一半，旱象比较严重。西南各地人民政府现正大力领导农民抗旱春耕。西北区除开陕西和甘肃东南部超过十公厘而外，广大地区雨雪都嫌不足；不过这一带地方的耕地主要靠高山雪水灌溉，影响还不大。（新华社）
