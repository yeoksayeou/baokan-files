In order to achieve "every household raising pigs and accumulating manure" and increase the yield per unit area, Zhang Qingshan, the head of Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, went deep into the rural areas to investigate and understand the problems of the masses in raising pigs and accumulating manure, and cultivated model villages for raising pigs and accumulating manure, preparing to launch a large-scale pig-raising and manure accumulation movement throughout the county.

After a comprehensive understanding of Liushun Township in the Second District of Xingping County, Zhang Qingshan chose Xinzhuang Village, which has more experience in raising pigs and accumulating manure, as a model village. On April 3rd, Zhang Qingshan convened fifteen farmers with rich experience in raising pigs in this village to listen to their opinions. Wang Zongren, a farmer with twenty years of experience in raising pigs, introduced his experience of increasing grain production by raising pigs and accumulating manure. Last year, due to the large application of pig manure, his twenty mu of land yielded eight more dan of grain. The average yield of barley per mu reached two dan, which was four dou higher than the average yield; the yield of highland barley per mu was one dan, which was also three dou higher than usual; the yield of corn per mu was one dan and six dou, which was six dou higher than usual. Farmer Lu Yuji exchanged a piglet for doing work for others last spring. After the piglet grew up, he exchanged it for a calf, and now the calf has also grown up. During the discussion, the farmers also exchanged some experience in raising pigs and accumulating manure. Farmer Xie Linchang believes that to accumulate pig manure well, one should pad the pen twice a day. This not only reduces the chance of pigs getting sick, but also allows for more composting. After the pig manure is removed from the pen, it should be composted for a period of time to make it more potent. In management, attention should be paid to feeding more cooked feed and preventing weeds and grass from getting mixed in. Wang Zongren also suggested that when feeding pigs, one should prevent birds from disturbing them; the disturbance of birds not only hinders the normal feeding of pigs, but also makes pigs lose their appetite when bird droppings fall into the feed. He believes that adding a "bird-proof net" to the pigsty is a very good method.

However, there are currently two difficulties for farmers in this village to raise pigs: one is the lack of feed, and the other is the lack of money to buy piglets. Zhang Qingshan guided everyone to discuss these two issues.

Regarding the feed problem, the farmers participating in the discussion believed that when coarse grains are scarce and there is a shortage of bran and straw, the weeds in the fields and on the roadsides can be used as feed. There are many elm trees locally, and elm money and elm leaves can also solve part of the feed shortage. Later, alfalfa, Chinese wolfberry leaves, and highland barley skins are all good feeds. In order to carry out the pig-raising and manure accumulation movement more systematically and vigorously, this village plans to change some of the cotton fields that are left over to planting sorghum, which can increase grain production and solve the pig feed problem. Regarding the issue of buying piglets, everyone suggested that Wang Zongren in the village should sell all the piglets that his two old sows are about to give birth to on credit to families in the village who do not have money to buy piglets; after the wheat harvest, everyone will pay a fair and reasonable price.

After the symposium, the masses of the whole village discussed and formulated the following pig-raising and manure accumulation plan: 1. In the first half of April, 110 of the 138 households in the village (80%) should raise one to two pigs per household; 2. The whole village should ensure the feeding of three sows in order to continuously raise piglets; 3. The pigsty should be renovated twice a day to keep the pigsty clean; 4. A village-wide pig-raising and manure accumulation meeting should be held once a month to check the pig-raising situation, exchange experiences, and help each other solve difficulties.

    准备全县开展大规模养猪积肥运动
    陕西省兴平县培养养猪典型示范村
    为做到“家家养猪，修圈积肥”，提高单位面积产量，陕西省兴平县县长张青山深入农村，调查了解群众养猪积肥中的问题，并培养养猪积肥典型示范村，准备开展全县大规模的养猪积肥运动。
    张青山在兴平县第二区流顺乡经过全面了解后，选择养猪积肥较有经验的新庄村作为典型示范村。四月三日，张青山在这个村召集了十五位有养猪的丰富经验的农民座谈，听取他们的意见。养猪有二十年经验的农民王宗仁介绍了他养猪积肥多打粮食的经验。他去年因大量施用猪粪，二十亩地多打了八石粮食。每亩大麦平均打到两石，比一般产量要高四斗；每亩青稞麦打了一石，也比平常多打三斗；每亩玉米打一石六斗，比平常多打了六斗。农民陆雨纪去年春上给别人作活换回一个猪娃，猪娃长大后就换了一个牛犊，现在牛犊也长大了。在座谈中，农民还交流了一些养猪积肥的经验。农民解林昌认为猪粪要积得好，应该作到一天垫圈两次，这样既能使猪少生病，又能多沤粪土。猪粪出圈后，经过一段沤的时间，粪劲更大。在管理上，应注意喂料时多喂熟料，并防止柴草夹杂进去。王宗仁还提出喂猪时应防止鸟雀惊扰；鸟雀的惊扰不但妨碍猪的正常进食，同时鸟粪拉到饲料内时，更会使猪厌食。他认为在猪圈上加“防鸟网”是一个很好的办法。
    但是，目前这村农民养猪还有两个困难：一是没有饲料，二是没钱买猪娃。张青山引导大家对这两个问题展开了讨论。
    关于饲料问题，参加座谈的农民经过讨论后认为：在目前杂粮短缺、糠草不足的时候，地里地边的杂草，都可作饲料。当地榆树很多，榆钱、榆叶也可以解决一部分饲料的困难。以后，苜蓿、枸树叶、青稞麦皮都是好饲料。为了更有计划地大力开展养猪积肥运动，这个村准备把多留的棉田改种一部分高粱，一面可以增产粮食，同时也可以解决猪的饲料问题。关于买猪娃的问题，大家建议村内的王宗仁把他家养的两个老母猪快要生下的小猪，全部赊卖给村内没有钱添买猪娃的人家；在麦收后，大家再付给公平合理的价钱。
    座谈会后，全村群众经过讨论又订出了以下的养猪积肥计划：一、四月上半月内，全村一百三十八户中要有一百一十户（百分之八十）家家养猪一条到两条；二、全村要保证喂养三条母猪，以便不断添养小猪；三、猪圈一天要修整两次，保持猪圈清洁；四、每月要开一次全村养猪积肥会，检查养猪情形，交流经验，并互助解决困难。（群众日报）
