    To the Editor: The Beijing Railway Bureau organized a Li Xikui shunting method training class at Fengtai Station in mid-January. Our Xizhimen Station sent two shunters and two liaisons to study. They studied for a month and returned in mid-February. They first spoke with the administrative leaders to discuss promotion, research, and other issues, planning to start promoting learning throughout the station on March 1st. However, this plan had not been implemented by March 5th. They gave their opinions to the leading cadres twice, who said that there were no instructions from higher authorities. On March 6th, instructions came from higher authorities, requiring the station to start learning the Li Xikui shunting method from March 1st. Only then did the leading cadres get busy and immediately convened a meeting to study it. Because there was no prior preparation, the plan made at the meeting was not good enough. Learning began on March 7th. Although the chairman of the trade union workshop made a mobilization report that day, and the administrative leaders also made a report, the effect was not great because the content was not substantial. The learning promotion committee and inspection team were composed of several leading cadres, but no one who had studied in Fengtai participated. Because these leading cadres did not participate in the study, they did not understand the shunting operation process very well, so they could not find any problems during the inspection. Even after the study was completed, no summary was made, and it was not known how well the students had learned. After studying for a month, some groups could not even say what the system and methods of the Li Xikui shunting method were. How can this be used in actual work? It is wrong for leading cadres to be so lax about learning advanced experience.

    北京西直门车站行政领导干部
    应该重视推广李锡奎调车法
    编辑同志：北京铁路分局一月中旬在丰台车站组织了一个李锡奎调车法训练班。我们西直门车站派了两名调车员、两名联络员去学习。他们学习一个月，在二月中旬回来，首先找行政领导干部谈话，商讨推广、研究等问题，计划在三月一日开始在全站推广学习。但这个计划，到了三月五日仍未实行。他们向领导干部提了两次意见，领导干部说，上级没有指示。三月六日，上级来了指示，要车站自三月一日起开始学习李锡奎调车法。领导干部这才着了忙，立即召集他们开会研究。因为事前没有准备，会上所订的计划也不够好。三月七日就开始学习，那天，虽然有工会车间主席作了动员报告，行政领导干部也作了报告，但因内容不充实，所起作用不大。学习推进委员会和检查小组由几个领导干部组成，但没有在丰台学习的人员参加。这些领导干部因为没有参加学习，不太了解调车作业过程，检查时就发现不了什么问题。直到学习完了，也没作过总结，也不知道学员的学习程度如何。学习了一个月，有的小组甚至还说不出李锡奎调车法的制度和办法，这怎么能用到实际工作中去呢？领导干部对学习先进经验这样放松是错误的。
