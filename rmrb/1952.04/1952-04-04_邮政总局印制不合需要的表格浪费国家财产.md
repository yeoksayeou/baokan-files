    The General Post Office's Printing of Unnecessary Forms Wastes State Property

    To the Editor: The General Post Office of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has formulated five kinds of distribution forms that do not meet practical needs, causing a great waste of manpower and materials. These five forms are: (1) Delivery cards: carried by postal workers for delivering newspapers, our bureau needs 745 of these per month; (2) Subscriber cards: kept by the post office as a stub, serving as the basis for tracking newspaper and magazine subscribers, changes in subscriptions, and filling out newspaper and magazine fee receipts, our bureau needs 220 of these per month;
    (3) Subscriber distribution cards: used to track the number of newspapers and magazines, the number of households, and to statistically classify subscribers' occupations, our bureau needs 450 of these per month; (4) Newspaper and magazine subscription forms: filled out by subscribers when subscribing to newspapers and magazines, our bureau needs 450 of these per month. The monthly cost of the above four types is 93,000+ yuan; (5) Newspaper fee receipts: receipts for subscribers of newspapers and magazines, our bureau needs 90 books per month, valued at 270,000 yuan. The monthly cost of all these forms is 363,000+ yuan. However, these forms do not meet the actual needs of the work at all. Our bureau used to use only one type of subscription form, giving one copy to the subscriber and keeping one copy for ourselves. The procedure was simple and fully able to replace these five types of forms; moreover, we only used four books of subscription forms and one sheet of powder paper per month, costing a total of 17,000 yuan. Compared to the former method, our bureau wastes 346,000+ yuan per month. Extrapolating from this, the waste nationwide is significant. This measure by the General Post Office not only wastes state property, but also reduces work efficiency. It is truly a waste of manpower and money. We hope it will be corrected quickly!

### 邮政总局印制不合需要的表格浪费国家财产

    邮政总局印制不合需要的表格浪费国家财产
    编辑同志：中央邮电部邮政总局制订了不合实际需要的五种发行表格，造成人力和物力的极大浪费。这五种表格是：（一）投递卡：由邮工自带，作投递报纸用，我局每月需用七四五个；（二）订户卡：归邮局作存根，是掌握报刊订户、报刊变动情况及填写报刊费收据的根据，我局每月需二二○个；
    （三）订户分卡：这是掌握报刊份数、户数和统计订户职业的依据，我局每月需四五○个；（四）报刊订阅单：是由订户填写订阅报刊时用的，我局每月需四五○张。上述四种每月费用九万三千多元；（五）报费收据：是订户订阅报刊的收据，我局每月需九十本，价值二十七万元。以上表格每月费用是三十六万三千多元。但是，这些表格统统不符合工作的实际需要。我局以前只用一种订报单，给订户一联，自存一联，手续简便，满能代替这五种表格；而且一月只用四本订报单、一张粉连纸，共花一万七千元。二者相较，我局每月要浪费三十四万六千多元。依此推算，全国合计起来浪费就大了。邮政总局这个措施既浪费国家财产，又降低工作效率，真是劳民伤财。希望赶快纠正！
