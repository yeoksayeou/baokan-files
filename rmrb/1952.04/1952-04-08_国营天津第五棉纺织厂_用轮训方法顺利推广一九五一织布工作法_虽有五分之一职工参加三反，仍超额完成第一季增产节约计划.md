State-Owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory

    Successfully Promotes the 1951 Weaving Method Through Rotational Training
    Despite One-Fifth of the Employees Participating in the Three-Anti Campaign, They Still Overfulfilled the First Quarter's Production Increase and Thrift Plan.
    In the "Three-Anti" campaign, the State-Owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory continued to vigorously promote the 1951 weaving method and made great achievements.
    Weaving workshop workers, except for a portion participating in the "Tiger-Hunting Teams," actively participated in learning advanced working methods by adopting the method of "working during work hours, 'hunting tigers' after work, and alternating in three shifts." In order to enable employees to concentrate on learning, they adopted a weekly rotational training method and required employees to stay in the factory during training. The rotational training class was taught by Li Liangcong, the deputy director of the workshop and leader of the promotion team, with dedicated personnel responsible for testing and addressing the students' ideological, daily life and issues.
    After learning, the vast majority of workers in the weaving workshop have mastered the basic operations of "sectional yarn changing," "proactive shuttle changing," and "fabric surface inspection," and have improved their output, quality, and tending capacity. Now, the output of the weaving room has increased from an average of 35.75 yards per machine (seven hours and forty minutes) to an average of 36 yards per machine. Among the 230 trainees, the rate of second-class cloth decreased from 0.4% to 0.1%. Previously, only 39 people in the entire workshop could tend eight machines each. Now, 120 people can tend eight machines each, and 15 people can tend ten machines each (ordinary looms). Female worker Wu Yinshi increased from tending six machines to tending eight machines, and increased from an average of 35 yards per machine to 36 yards. She said: "Before learning the 1951 weaving method, tending six machines felt tiring; now, tending eight machines is also easy." Although more than 20% of the entire workshop's employees were removed from production to participate in the anti-corruption struggle, they still overfulfilled the first quarter's production increase and thrift plan.
    In the process of promotion, some ideological obstacles were also encountered. Female workers with children were unwilling to stay in the factory; workers with poor skills were afraid of not being able to learn; workers with strong skills felt that their output was not low, and learning would not be of great use. In response to these ideological situations, the leadership explained to the employees that after learning the 1951 weaving method, they could improve output quality, accumulate wealth for the country, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and that it would also be beneficial to themselves. This kind of ideological mobilization stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for learning. When female worker Wu Yinshi was training, she was initially very concerned about her twelve-year-old child at home, which affected her learning enthusiasm. After education, she went home and said to the child: "The Volunteers are fighting on the front lines, all for us. After Mom learns the advanced weaving method, she will produce more to support the front lines." Her child was very moved after listening and said, "Mom, study hard! I will study hard at home." His words encouraged his mother.
    The promotion team attaches importance to cultivating "little teachers," so that the "little teachers" humbly listen to the opinions of the workers and masses and promptly improve teaching methods. This is an important factor in ensuring the smooth progress of the promotion work. The weaving workshop promotion team set aside a certain amount of time each day to lead the "little teachers" in studying the "Branch Life" published by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the heroic deeds of the Volunteers published in the newspapers to improve their political and ideological level and working ability. They also regularly convened "little teachers" for group meetings to conduct criticism and self-criticism so that the "little teachers" could quickly overcome their shortcomings. On Sundays, the promotion team also explained the simple principles of the machines to the "little teachers." Therefore, the "little teachers" are very patient and enthusiastic in teaching the students and constantly improve their teaching methods. For example, when the "little teachers" saw that the students were not used to installing shuttles with their left and right hands, they took the shuttles to the dormitory for the students to practice. The students found it difficult to remember how to adjust the weft yarn just by listening to the lecture, so the "little teachers" brought weft yarns of different sizes, showed them how to adjust the increase and decrease, and then the students practiced, with the "little teachers" guiding them by the side. When they discovered that the students were too passive in changing shuttles, they pointed out the reasons for the passive shuttle change. When the students graduated, strict tests were conducted. These teaching methods played a great role in promoting learning.
    There are still some problems in the factory's promotion work, such as: the vertical warping machine in the preparation room has poor efficiency, and the trade union and administration do not have dedicated personnel responsible for inspecting the promotion work, which are all in urgent need of solutions.

### 国营天津第五棉纺织厂  用轮训方法顺利推广一九五一织布工作法  虽有五分之一职工参加三反，仍超额完成第一季增产节约计划

    国营天津第五棉纺织厂
    用轮训方法顺利推广一九五一织布工作法
    虽有五分之一职工参加三反，仍超额完成第一季增产节约计划
    国营天津第五棉纺织厂，在“三反”运动中，继续大力推广一九五一织布工作法，做出了很大成绩。
    织机车间工人，除一部分参加“打虎队”外，采用“上班生产，下班‘打虎’，三班交替”的方法，积极参加学习先进工作法。为了使职工能集中精力学习，他们采取了每周一期轮训的方法，并要职工在受训期间住宿厂内。轮训班由车间副主任、推广组组长李良聪任教师，并有专人负责测定考试及解决学员的思想问题和日常生活问题。
    经过学习以后，织机车间绝大多数职工已熟练“分段换纱”、“争取主动换梭”、“检查布面”等基本动作，并提高了产量质量和看台能力。现在，织布间产量已由平均台扯三十五点七五码（七小时四十分），提高到平均台扯三十六码。在二百三十个学员中，次布率由百分之零点四降低到百分之零点一。全车间从前只有三十九个人每人能看八台车，现在有一百二十人每人能看八台，并有十五人每人能看十台车（普通布机）。女工吴尹氏从看六台提高到看八台，由平均台扯三十五码增加到三十六码。她说：“没有学一九五一织布工作法前，看六台也嫌累；现在，看八台也很轻松。”全车间虽有百分之二十以上的职工脱离生产参加反贪污斗争，仍超额完成了第一季增产节约计划。
    在推广过程中，也曾遇到一些思想障碍。有小孩的女工不愿住在厂中；技术较差的工人怕学不会；技术强的工人觉得自己产量不低，学会了也没大用处。领导方面针对这些思想情况，向职工说明学会一九五一织布工作法后，便可提高产量质量，可以给国家积累财富，可以支援人民志愿军，而且对自己也是有利的。这样的思想动员激发大家的学习热情。女工吴尹氏受训时，起初很挂念家里的一个十二岁的孩子，因之学习情绪不高。经教育后，她回家向小孩说：“志愿军在前方打仗，都是为了咱们。妈妈学好先进织布工作法后，好多多生产支援前线。”她的小孩听了很感动地说：“妈妈好好学吧！我在家好好读书。”他的话又鼓励了母亲。
    推广组重视培养“小先生”，使“小先生”虚心倾听职工群众的意见，及时改进教学方法。这是保证推广工作顺利进行的重要因素。织机间推广组每天抽出一定的时间，领导“小先生”学习中共天津市委员会出版的“支部生活”和报上登载的志愿军英雄战斗事迹，提高他们的政治思想水平和工作能力。他们还定期召集“小先生”开小组会，展开批评和自我批评，使“小先生”有缺点也能很快地克服。星期日，推广组还向“小先生”讲解机器的简单原理。因此，“小先生”都很耐心地热情地教学员，并随时改进自己的教学方法。如“小先生”看到学员左右手装梭不习惯，便把梭子拿到宿舍里给学员练习。学员觉得调节纬纱光听讲不易记住， “小先生”便把大小不等的纬纱拿来，做出样子给他们看，说明如何调节加减，再由学员实习，“小先生”在旁指导，发现学员换梭太被动时，就指出换梭被动的原因。学员毕业时，进行严格的测定考试。这些教学方法，在促进学习上都起了很大的作用。
    这个厂目前在推广工作中还有一些问题，如：准备间的竖定式络经机效能较差，工会、行政还没有专人负责检查推广工作等，都是急需解决的。                     （郑泽森）
