Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Oslo: Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, delivered a report on the crimes of bacteriological warfare by U.S. imperialism at the first meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council on March 29 on behalf of the Chinese delegation. The full text is as follows:

It will soon be two years since the American aggressors, under the banner of the United Nations, have been armedly interfering in Korea, carrying out extremely cruel destruction and slaughter. Due to military failures and the pressure of world public opinion, although they accepted the armistice negotiations nine months ago, they still have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. They have exhausted all unreasonable methods to delay and obstruct the armistice negotiations, and two months ago, they began to use bacteriological weapons with a complete lack of humanity.

From January 28 of this year, the American aggressors began to continuously scatter large quantities of germ-carrying insects and other toxic objects in important cities and transportation arteries on the Korean front and in the rear, from east of Kaesong to the Bukhan River area. On February 29, they continuously scattered them into our Northeast region, affecting the six provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, as well as Shenyang and 43 other counties and cities. On March 6 and 7, they were also scattered in the suburbs of Qingdao City, Shandong Province.

The objects scattered by the American aggressors are mainly flies, fleas, mosquitoes, lice, planaria, sandflies, crickets, springtails, locusts, mice, carrion flies, carrion, dead fish, cotton, leaves, chicken feathers, etc., totaling more than 35 kinds. Many of these insects are not native to the area and cannot hatch under the current climate. After examination by bacteriologists, entomologists, etc., many insects have been proven to carry infectious and virulent germs such as plague, cholera, and typhoid. The enemy sometimes uses a special type of artillery shell to spread germs on the front lines, but generally uses aircraft to drop bacteriological bombs or directly drop mice, dead fish, carrion, etc. carrying germs or toxins. Sometimes they drop germ-carrying insects along with propaganda leaflets.

A large-scale anti-epidemic campaign to eradicate these germs is now underway in Korea and parts of China. Medical experts, veterinary experts, agricultural experts, etc. have all been mobilized, and the broad masses of people, filled with immense anger, regardless of gender or age, are participating in the fight against bacteriological warfare, to quickly eliminate the pests and germs scattered by the American army in order to prevent the development and spread of diseases.

This inhuman crime of the American aggressors is unprecedented. In the Second World War, Hitler and Mussolini did not use bacteriological weapons, and although the Japanese imperialists used them in China, they did not use them on the scale that the United States is doing today. If the crime of the United States using bacteriological weapons today is not immediately and effectively stopped, its scale will expand further. The disasters that have befallen the Korean and Chinese people today will inevitably befall all peace-loving people in the world tomorrow.

In the face of such ironclad facts, American authorities such as Acheson and Ridgway are still engaging in sophistry and denial. Acheson issued a statement on March 4 saying that the United Nations has not used and is not using any kind of bacteriological weapon. But the fact is that the U.S. government not only is currently using bacteriological weapons, but has used them in the past.

The U.S. government's preparation for bacteriological warfare began as early as the end of 1941. Merck, who once served as Chairman of the Biological Warfare Committee of the Chemical Warfare Service of the U.S. Army Department, published a very detailed report on January 4, 1946, with the consent of the U.S. government, describing how the United States was conducting systematic research on bacteriological warfare on a large scale. This research is often boasted about by American bacteriological warfare experts themselves. In the summer of 1949, the U.S. government used Eskimos as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons, causing an outbreak of glandular plague in the Eskimo region. These are all well-known facts.

The U.S. government also made early preparations to conduct bacteriological warfare in the East. This preparation was carried out in close cooperation with Japanese bacteriological war criminals who had guilty experience. In 1946, MacArthur selected eighteen Japanese bacteriological war criminals to serve at bacteriological warfare bases in Maryland, Mississippi, and Utah, hoping to take advantage of their sinful experience. On April 13, 1951, the New York Times reported that bacteriological research stations had been established in Japan, and MacArthur and his successor, Ridgway, actively encouraged the continued research and production of bacteria in Japan. On December 5 of the same year, the Rangoon office of the Domei News Agency reported that two unnamed American officials revealed that Ridgway had dispatched his Japanese bacteriological war criminals, former Japanese Army Surgeon General Shiro Ishii, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, to Korea to carry out bacteriological warfare.

The purpose of bacteriological warfare is to cause large-scale epidemics in the territory of the enemy, in order to achieve the effect of mass slaughter, but to cause a large-scale epidemic, it is not enough to simply throw germs. It is necessary to clearly know the physiological conditions and characteristics of people (Japanese bacteriological war criminals trial material page 314). This is precisely the sinful experience Ishii Shiro gained while conducting bacteriological warfare research in China, as admitted by Kajiuka Ryuji, former chief of the medical department of the Japanese Kwantung Army Medical Corps, at the Boroli trial in December 1949. Therefore, before conducting bacteriological warfare, the United States cooperated with Japanese bacteriological war criminals to conduct sinful research on the physiological characteristics and conditions of the Chinese and Korean people.

In March 1951, Brigadier General Sams, who was then the head of the Health and Welfare Department of Ridgway's headquarters in Tokyo, led the U.S. Navy's No. 1091 bacteriological landing craft, the so-called glandular plague ship, to secretly land at Wonsan Port in Korea and took Chinese prisoners on small islands in the port to use as experimental subjects for plague. This was a message published in the American Newsweek on April 9, 1951. According to a May 18 of the same year Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island, this glandular plague ship later went to Geoje Island and used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army as experimental subjects, conducting 3,000 experiments every day.

"It is very dangerous to conduct bacteriological warfare, germs have no will and can counterattack their users." This is the title of an article in the April 1950 issue of the Military Review monthly published by the Command and Staff School of Kansas. American bacteriological warfare experts have long known this, so to conduct bacteriological warfare, their own troops must first be prepared for epidemic prevention to avoid being affected. The U.S. government has also made considerable preparations in this regard. This can be proved by the epidemic prevention vaccination certificates of the U.S. and Rhee Syngman troops. The most noteworthy of these is that the U.S. and Rhee's forces have been vaccinated against yellow fever, plague, cholera, and other diseases. Yellow fever is a tropical disease in the Americas, and there has never been such a disease in the history of China and Korea. Plague has never occurred in the history of Korea. Cholera has not occurred in northern Korea since 1947. Isn't the intention obvious for conducting vaccinations against such diseases in such areas?

To carry out bacteriological warfare, a mental preparation is also necessary. That is, the dehumanization of those who carry out bacteriological warfare or drop bacteriological bombs. The U.S. government has made particularly thorough preparations for this kind of mental preparation. As early as June 15, 1946, "Collier's" magazine quoted the words of Major General Wait, Minister of the Chemical Warfare Service of the Army Department: I have no sympathy at all for those who talk about the humanity or inhumanity of a weapon. Recently, this theory of lack of sympathy has developed into a theory of economic value. On January 25 of this year, Brigadier General Creasey, Minister of Research of the Army Chemical Corps, stated in Washington that bacteria, gas, radioactive materials, etc. are the cheapest weapons, which can destroy the enemy while preserving their property.

On March 5, during the period when the U.S. military was conducting bacteriological warfare in China and Korea, Major General Bullene, Chief of the Chemical Corps of the U.S. Department of Defense, published a typical speech in the "Congressional Digest," repeating Creasey's economic value theory, advocating the unrestricted use of bacteriological weapons. Moreover, he frankly admitted that the chemical department of the U.S. military in Korea has been actively active since July 4, 1950, and the number and activities of chemical units are constantly increasing.

It is worth noting that Major General Bullene's speech was published on March 5, while Acheson's denial statement was made on March 4. This proves that Acheson's lies cannot cover up the iron-like facts. While Acheson denied the U.S. government's monstrous crimes, he arbitrarily fabricated that the Chinese and Korean people lacked epidemic prevention capabilities, and falsely claimed that an epidemic had occurred in China and Korea, asking the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct a so-called investigation. Acheson probably thought he was very clever and that playing such a magic trick could deceive the kind people of the world. But that is in vain. The problem today is not that an ordinary epidemic has occurred in China and Korea, but that the American aggressors are creating an artificial large-scale epidemic in China and Korea. The people of our two countries, China and Korea, are using great efforts to resist and eliminate this evil act. If an investigation is to be conducted, it should investigate the crimes of the United States in conducting bacteriological warfare, not a general investigation of the plague. In this regard, we should thank the Korean investigation team composed of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, headed by Brandweiner, which has already done a very serious job that is very helpful to all mankind. This investigation team went to Korea and happened to witness the U.S. military conducting bacteriological warfare, so they were eyewitnesses to the crime of being caught in the act. The members of this international investigation team are all internationally renowned lawyers, and they are in fact in the position of fair judges. They all agreed that the U.S. conducted bacteriological warfare is an undeniable fact. They will have a detailed report published in the world. We dare to believe that the trick that Acheson wants to use can never deceive the people of the world.

The U.S. government's monstrous crimes are a great threat to human security and world peace. It violates human morality, destroys all international conventions, and directly violates the solemn resolution passed by the Warsaw Conference of the World Peace Congress in 1950, which expresses the wishes of all mankind to prohibit bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Therefore, we, the Chinese people, unanimously support the solemn statements issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government on February 24 and March 8, accusing the U.S. government of this monstrous crime to the people of the world, and are determined to fight to the end with the peace-loving people of the world to stop this crime of the American aggressors!

For the sake of human security and world peace, we hereby submit a report on the actual situation of U.S. bacteriological warfare to the Executive Bureau Meeting of the World Peace Council, requesting the General Assembly to mobilize all peace-loving people in the world to take resolute and effective action to stop this unprecedented crime of the U.S. government and give it the necessary moral sanctions.

In human history, mankind has suffered many disasters, but mankind has finally triumphed in the struggle against all disasters. We firmly believe that all the evil deeds of the U.S. imperialists can be overcome, and they will certainly be overcome!

The Chinese people fully support Joliot-Curie's appeal. We, on our side, would be pleased if the World Peace Council would initiate the establishment of a broad international commission made up of fair, sincere, and independent individuals, with the participation of authoritative scientists, and with the participation of people who have not participated in our movement but sincerely support the cause of peace and stand on the side of humanity. The task of the Commission will be to gather numerous facts about the destruction by the American military in Korea and China of the Geneva International Convention of 1925 on the unconditional prohibition of bacteriological weapons.

We will also support such an initiative by the World Peace Council, namely, to convene an international conference with the participation of people and groups of different views and beliefs, which will call on people of conscience to strive for the unconditional prohibition of bacteriological weapons and will condemn the American aggressors for refusing to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol and for their inhumane use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    郭沫若在世界和平理事会执行局会议上
    关于美帝国主义细菌战罪行的报告
    【新华社二日讯】奥斯陆讯：世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若，代表中国代表团于三月二十九日在世界和平理事会执行局首次会议作了关于美帝国主义细菌战罪行的报告。全文如下：
    美国侵略者盗用联合国旗帜，武装干涉朝鲜，进行极端残酷的破坏和屠杀，已经快满两年了。由于军事上的失败，又由于世界舆论的压迫，虽然他们在九个月以前接受了停战谈判，但仍然毫无使朝鲜问题和平解决的诚意，对于停战谈判，他们用尽种种无理的方法来加以拖延和阻挠，在两个月以前，竟灭绝人性地开始使用细菌武器了。
    从本年一月二十八日起，美国侵略者开始在朝鲜前线和后方的重要城市及交通要道，从开城以东到北汉江一带，连续不断地撒布大量的带有病菌的昆虫和其他有毒的物体。到了二月二十九日又向我东北区域内连续不断地撒布，受害地区计有辽东、辽西、松江、吉林、黑龙江、热河六省和沈阳市及其他四十三个县市。三月六日与七日又撒布到了山东省的青岛市郊。
    美国侵略者所撒布的物体主要是苍蝇、跳蚤、蚊虫、虱子、扁虫、白蛉子、蟋蟀、弹尾虫、蝗虫、老鼠、乌龙、腐肉、死鱼、棉花、树叶、鸡毛等，多到三十五种以上。有好些昆虫是当地所没有的，在目前的气候之下也是不能孵化的。经过细菌学家、昆虫学家等检查的结果，有好些昆虫已被证明带有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒等传染性的剧烈的病菌。敌人撒布细菌的方法有时在前线使用一种特制的炮弹，但一般是使用飞机，由飞机投掷细菌弹，或者直接投下带有病菌或毒素的老鼠、死鱼、腐肉等，有时是把带菌昆虫和宣传品一道投下。
    现在朝鲜和中国的一部分地区，已经在进行着大规模的扑灭这些细菌的防疫运动，医学专家，兽医专家、农业专家等都动员起来了，广大人民群众在无比的愤怒之下，不论男女老幼都参加了防御细菌战的斗争，要把美国军队所撒布的害虫病菌等迅速扑灭，以免疫病的发展和蔓延。
    美国侵略者这一灭绝人性的罪行是史无先例的。在二次大战中，希特勒和墨索里尼不曾使用过细菌武器，日本帝国主义者虽然在中国境内使用过，但没有美国今天这样大规模地使用。美国今天使用细菌武器的罪行，假如不立即加以有效的制止，它的使用规模还要扩大。今天落在朝鲜和中国人民头上的灾难，明天必然要落到全世界爱好和平人民的头上。
    在这样铁的事实面前，美国当局如艾奇逊、李奇微等，却依然在进行着狡辩抵赖。艾奇逊在三月四日发表声明说：联合国不曾使用过，也没有使用着任何种类的细菌武器。而事实是，美国政府不仅在目前使用着细菌武器，在从前也已经使用过了。
    美国政府从事细菌战的准备，是早在一九四一年底就开始了的。曾经担任过美国陆军部化学作战兵团生物作战委员会主席的墨尔克一九四六年一月四日经过美国政府的同意，发表了一项很详细的报告，叙述了美国怎样在大规模地进行着细菌战的系统研究。这项研究，美国的细菌战专家们，是经常用来自行夸耀的。一九四九年夏，美国政府便曾经以爱斯基摩人作为细菌武器的实验品，在爱斯基摩人区域引起了腺鼠疫的流行。这些都是人所周知的事实。
    要在东方进行细菌战，美国政府也早有准备，这项准备是在和有过罪恶经验的日本细菌战犯们密切合作之下进行着的，一九四六年，麦克阿瑟曾经选派了十八个日本细菌战犯到美国马利兰州、密士失必州、犹太州等细菌战基地去服务，想利用他们的罪恶经验。一九五一年四月十三日纽约时报报道在日本设立了细菌研究站，麦克阿瑟和他的继任者李奇微，都积极地鼓励着日本的细菌研究和生产的继续。同年十二月五日，电通社仰光消息：有两名不愿透露姓名的美国官员吐露，李奇微已经把他所豢养的日本细菌战犯前日本陆军军医中将石井四郎，兽医少将若松次郎和北野政藏，派遣到了朝鲜，进行细菌战的工作。
    细菌战的目的是要在敌对者的区域里爆发大规模的疫病，以收到大量屠杀的效果，但要引起大规模的疫病流行，仅仅靠着病菌投掷是不够的，必须要明白知道人的生理条件和生理特点（日本细菌战犯审判材料第三一四页），这正是石井四郎在中国进行细菌战研究时所得到的罪恶经验，在一九四九年十二月由前日本关东军军医处长军医中将梶塚隆二在伯力法庭上所供认的。因此，美国进行细菌战之前，和日本的细菌战犯们合作，对于中朝人民的生理特点和生理条件做了罪恶的研究。
        一九五一年三月，当时担任着东京李奇微总部卫生福利处处长的赛姆斯准将，曾率领美海军第一零九一号细菌登陆艇，所谓腺鼠疫船，到朝鲜元山港秘密登陆，把港口内小岛上的中国人俘虏去作鼠疫的实验品。这是一九五一年四月九日美国新闻周刊上所发表的消息。根据同年五月十八日美联社巨济岛电讯，这只腺鼠疫船其后又到了巨济岛，把朝鲜人民军被俘人员作为试验品，每天进行三千次的试验。
    要进行细菌战是很危险的，细菌没有意志，可以反击其使用者。这是一篇文章的标题，见美国堪萨斯州指挥与参谋学校出版的军事评论月刊一九五零年四月号。美国的细菌战专家们早就知道这一点的，因此要进行细菌战，便必须使自己的军队先有防疫准备，免受危害波及。这层准备，美国政府也做得相当周到。这从美国和李承晚军队的俘虏兵的防疫注射证上，可以得到证明。其中最值得注意的，是美李军进行过黄热病、鼠疫、霍乱等的预防注射。黄热病是美洲的热带病，在中朝两国的历史上从来没有过这样的病症。鼠疫在朝鲜历史上也从来没有发生过。霍乱，在朝鲜北部自一九四七年来，也已经没有发生过。在这样的地区进行这类病症的预防注射，用意所在不是可想而知的吗？
    要进行细菌战，必须还要一种精神上的准备。那就是施行细菌战者或投掷细菌弹者的灭绝人性了。这种精神上的准备，美国政府做得特别周到。远在一九四六年，六月十五日出版的“柯里尔”杂志引用了陆军部化学作战兵团部长韦特少将的谈话：我对于谈论一种武器的人道或不人道，完全没有同情。近来这种没有同情论，更发展而为经济价值论了。本年正月二十五日陆军化学兵团研究部长准将克利西在华盛顿发表谈话，认为细菌、瓦斯、放射能物质等，是最廉价的武器，它可以毁灭敌人而保留下其财产。
    三月五日，在美国军队正在中朝两国进行着细菌战的期中，美国国防部化学兵团长伯伦少将在“国会文摘”更发表了典型的谈话，重复克利西的经济价值说，主张无限制地使用细菌武器。而且他坦率地承认，美国军队的化学部门在朝鲜，自一九五零年七月四日以来，已经在积极地活动，化学单位在数量上与活动上都在不断地增加。
    值得注意的是，伯伦少将谈话的发表是三月五日，而艾奇逊的抵赖声明是三月四日。这可证明，艾奇逊的诳言实在掩盖不了铁一般的事实。艾奇逊一面抵赖美国政府的滔天罪行，一面却任意捏诬中朝人民缺乏防疫能力，胡说中朝两国内已经发生了疫病流行，要红十字国际委员会去进行所谓调查。艾奇逊大约自以为很聪明、这样玩玩魔术，便可以把全世界善良的人民蒙蔽住了。但那是徒劳的。今天的问题，并不是在中朝境内发生了平常的疫病，而是美国侵略者正在中朝境内制造着人为的大规模疫病。这种罪恶行为，我们中朝两国人民正在用大力来抵抗而加以扑灭。如要进行调查，就要调查美国进行细菌战的罪行，而不是一般的瘟疫的调查。在这方面，我们应该感谢国际民主法律工作者协会所组成的以布兰德魏纳为首的朝鲜调查团，它已经很严正地做了一项对于全人类很有贡献的工作。这个调查团到朝鲜去，适逢其会美国军队正在进行细菌战，因此他们是现行犯的罪行目击者。这国际调查团的成员，都是国际上有名的律师，他们事实上是处在公正的裁判官的地位的。他们一致认为美国进行细菌战是无可争辩的事实。他们将有详细的报告书公布于世。我们敢于相信，艾奇逊所想使用的障眼法，是绝对不能够蒙蔽全世界人民的。
    美国政府的滔天罪行是人类安全和世界和平的极大威胁。它违反了人类道义，破坏了一切国际公约，并直接违反了一九五零年世界和平大会华沙会议所通过的表示全人类愿望的要求禁止细菌武器、化学武器以及其他大量毁灭人类的武器的庄严决议。
    因此，我们中国人民一致拥护我中央人民政府周恩来外长二月二十四日与三月八日所发表的严正声明，向全世界人民控诉美国政府的这种滔天罪行，并决心和世界爱好和平人民一道为制止美国侵略者的这一罪行而斗争到底！
    为了人类安全与世界和平，我们谨向本届世界和平理事会执行局会议提出有关美国细菌战的实际情况的报告，请求大会动员全世界一切爱好和平的人民，采取坚决与有效的行动，制止美国政府的这种空前罪行，并予以必要的道义上的制裁。
    在人类历史上，人类曾经遭受过多少次的灾难，但人类在同一切灾难斗争中，最后都胜利了。我们深信，美帝国主义者一切穷凶极恶的行动，也一样可以被战胜，而且一定能被战胜！
    中国人民完全拥护约里奥—居里的呼吁。我们在自己方面将感到高兴，如果世界和平理事会发起建立以由公正的、真诚的、独立的人士组成的广泛的国际委员会，由权威的科学家参加，由未参与我们运动却真诚地拥护和平事业和站在人道立场上的人们参加。委员会的任务将在于收集美国军队在朝鲜和中国破坏日内瓦一九二五年关于无条件禁用细菌武器的国际公约的众多事实。
    我们同样将拥护世界和平理事会这样的发起，即召开由不同观点和信仰的人士和团体参加的国际代表大会，这个大会将号召有良心的人们争取无条件地禁用细菌武器，并且将斥责美国侵略者之拒绝批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书及其在朝鲜和中国无人性地使用细菌武器。
