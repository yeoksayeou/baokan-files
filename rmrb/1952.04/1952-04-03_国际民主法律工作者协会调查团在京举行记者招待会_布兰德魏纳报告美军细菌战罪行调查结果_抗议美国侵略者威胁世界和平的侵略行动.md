Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers delegation held a press conference on April 1st. Twenty-two reporters from newspapers such as Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Wen Hui Bao attended, as well as seven reporters from newspapers such as the Soviet Union's Pravda, Soviet Union's TASS, North Korea's Central News Agency, Vietnam News Agency, and the United Kingdom's London Daily Worker. Shen Junru, of the preparatory committee for the China Political Science and Law Society, and Chae Kyu-hyung, Deputy Prosecutor General of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of North Korea, also participated in the press conference.

Shen Junru first introduced all members of the delegation to the Chinese and foreign reporters. Brandweiner, head of the delegation, then addressed the Chinese and foreign reporters, presenting the results of the delegation's on-the-ground investigation in Korea and Northeast China into the crimes of bacteriological warfare and other crimes committed by U.S. imperialism.

Brandweiner said: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers delegation has completed its dual task of investigating the crimes of the U.S. military in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. We want to state that the task of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers delegation is not to pass judgment, because it is not a court; it is only to investigate the facts and prove that these atrocities have occurred. Based on this starting point, the investigation team, after investigating in Korea, came to the following conclusions:

    1. U.S. forces in Korea intentionally spread flies and other insects carrying bacteria, constituting a terrible crime against the Korean People's Army and the peaceful residents of North Korea. These crimes violate the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention regarding the laws and customs of land warfare, and also violate the internationally recognized laws regarding the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, as reaffirmed in the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

    2. U.S. forces used gas bombs and chemical weapons against the peaceful people of Korea, and the U.S. military committed the crime of deliberately and consciously destroying Articles 23(a) and 23(e) of the 1907 Hague Regulations (i.e., the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Hague Convention).

    3. In its occupied areas, the U.S. military carried out massacres of civilians or individuals without accusation or trial, including many women and children; they violated Article 46 of the 1907 Hague Regulations.

    4. U.S. forces and the Syngman Rhee army arbitrarily arrested, imprisoned, and abused people in the areas they occupied, once again violating the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention.

    5. The U.S. military bombed undefended cities and villages far from the front lines, indiscriminately bombing non-military targets, and the U.S. military once again violated the rules of war, especially the Hague Regulations.

    6. Extensive damage was inflicted on buildings such as churches, art galleries, scientific institutions, historical buildings, and hospitals. These buildings generally have their own unique symbols and are not military targets. U.S. forces once again violated Article 27 of the Hague Regulations.

    7. Intentional arson and demolition of ordinary non-military public buildings were carried out, and these acts were not necessary for war. The U.S. military violated Article 55 of the Hague Regulations.

    8. U.S. forces plundered the people's food and property without giving any compensation or receipts; or intentionally destroyed the people's property and food. The U.S. military once again violated Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations.

    9. Regarding the massacre of prisoners of war, U.S. forces violated the 1929 and 1949 conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war.

   10. U.S. forces plundered historically valuable works of art and private property, and they violated Article 47 of the Hague Regulations.

The delegation believes that the above facts constitute war crimes as defined in Article 6 of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal Statute.

Brandweiner emphasized that, in view of these facts, the delegation believes that those who committed the crimes must be brought before the world court. The delegation declares without hesitation that many of these crimes could not have occurred without the full knowledge and planning of the leaders of the U.S. government and the supreme commander of the U.S. military.

Therefore, this delegation accuses these people, and also accuses the officers directly responsible for these crimes on the battlefield, as well as all soldiers who accepted and executed orders that violated international law. After reaching this conclusion, we completed the task entrusted to us by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

We feel compelled to say that our personal experience during the investigation in Korea made us shudder and horrified at the barbarous atrocities that were uncovered. We know that many people will be reluctant to believe the terrible facts confirmed in this report, just as many of us found these facts incredible before this investigation. Therefore, in the name of legal professionals, in the name of ordinary men and women, we solemnly guarantee the truthfulness of these uncovered facts. We come from different countries, we have different religious beliefs, different political views, and even different languages. In good conscience, fully aware of our responsibilities as legal professionals, we have done our utmost to complete our task.

This report is the result of our work and is unanimously agreed upon by all of us.

We believe that anyone who reads this report will, like us, feel the same shudder and hatred for these crimes and criminals.

We firmly believe that world justice and fairness must be maintained, and that no country or individual, no matter how powerful, can escape the consequences they deserve for their crimes.

Justice will prevail, and in order to maintain justice, the world must achieve peace.

We hope that this report will contribute to the struggle for world peace, especially for Korea, whose suffering we can never forget, and which should quickly achieve peace.

Finally, we would like to point out that we firmly believe that the Korean issue cannot be seen as an isolated event, but as a stage in the development of a dangerous war, which, if allowed to develop, will endanger and involve the entire world. Regarding inhumane methods such as germ warfare, we must recognize the degree of barbarity to which the actions of these so-called civilized countries have reached, and that they will threaten every man, woman, and child. All people, as long as they desire peaceful lives and their own safety, should remember this lesson. Peace is the property of the people and must be protected by the people themselves through active struggle.

Brandweiner continued to say about the results of the investigation in Northeast China: Based on the documents and evidence collected, the delegation has determined the following facts:

    1. In mid-March 1952, abnormal appearances of various insects were discovered and confirmed in various parts of southern Northeast China (mostly far from the Korean border).

    2. In all cases, the appearance of these insects was abnormal, especially from the perspective of the season, temperature, and the fact that the insects were only concentrated in limited areas.

    3. In many cases, feathers were found at the scene, and the appearance of feathers cannot but be considered abnormal.

    4. In most cases, the results of laboratory tests and experiments with guinea pigs and white mice proved that these insects and feathers carried various germs: Pasteurella pestis, anthrax bacteria, typhoid bacteria, rickettsiae, and encephalitis viruses.

    5. In nine cases investigated by the delegation, it has been confirmed that U.S. planes flew over these areas on the same day or a few days before the insects or feathers were found.

    6. In many cases, witnesses saw U.S. planes dropping things, and in one case, fragments of containers obviously used to hold insects were found.

Brandweiner pointed out: The delegation believes that these bacteria-carrying insects and feathers could only have been transported to these areas by U.S. planes, and U.S. planes had no right or reason to fly into Northeast China's territory.

The conclusion is even stronger when considering a similar conclusion from the facts obtained during the delegation's investigation in Korea. The report made after the investigation in Korea specifically pointed out the discovery of fragments of special bombs with English markings, and it has been determined that the U.S. military spread bacteria-carrying insects in Korea, and many of the bacteria-carrying insects found in China were the same as those found in Korea.

The use of bacteriological weapons is prohibited by the laws and customs of war. The Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, affirmed this prohibition. When armed conflict does not exist, this prohibition is of course even more applicable.

The statute of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (regardless of war or peace) also declared that the killing or extermination of civilians is a crime against humanity.

The "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," adopted on December 9, 1948, is definitely applicable to anyone who intentionally destroys all or part of a nation or race, and carries out or attempts to carry out killings or serious harm to that group of people, whether in wartime or peacetime. We believe that the above facts constitute acts of aggression and genocide by the United States, and are also an abhorrent crime against humanity. Therefore, this has indeed become an extremely serious threat to the entire world, the scope and consequences of which are unpredictable.

Our firm opinion is based on facts, which we have confirmed with the strictness and sense of responsibility of legal work.

Brandweiner concluded: As legal professionals, we strongly protest against this action that violates international law, oppose these acts that undermine international public law; as peace-loving democrats, we condemn this aggressive action by the United States that threatens world peace; as ordinary people, we express great anger at this shocking use of scientific progress for evil purposes.

After delegation head Brandweiner finished speaking, delegation member Cobern announced that Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, sent a telegram from Oslo saying: Brandweiner's telegram of March 29 has been received, and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. This news aroused enthusiastic applause from the people present. The Chinese and foreign reporters present then raised several questions, which were answered separately by the members of the delegation.

French Representative Jaques answered questions, pointing out:

The Struggle of the Chinese and Korean People Against Bacteriological Warfare Will Surely Shatter the U.S.'s Sinister Attempts

French representative Jaques, in answering a question about the delegation's impression of the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against U.S. bacteriological warfare, said: The U.S.'s sinister attempt to intimidate the people of Korea and China by using bacteriological weapons will surely fail. The Chinese people and the Korean people are very calmly dealing with this inhuman crime of using bacteriological weapons by U.S. imperialism. The epidemic prevention measures taken by the government authorities are effective. In some places we personally investigated, the local people discovered poisonous insects and immediately reported to the government, and the government immediately took measures, thus preventing the evil consequences of bacteriological warfare. We are sure that U.S. imperialism will never achieve their sinister intentions.

Jaques answered the question of what the delegation's opinion was regarding the results of the experts' analysis of the bacteria-carrying insects dropped by U.S. planes, saying: The delegation spoke with eleven well-known scientists during the investigation in Northeast China. We visited the laboratories and watched them conduct experiments. Although we are not scientists, we can see how seriously and carefully the scientists are doing their work. These experts told us that the results of their analysis and tests proved that these insects carry extremely dangerous infectious diseases. This evidence is scientific and irrefutable.

Italian Representative Cavaglieri made a statement:

Confirmed that the U.S. Military Invading Korea Used Chemical Weapons to Massacre Peaceful Residents in Violation of International Law

Italian representative and deputy head of the delegation, Cavaglieri, answered a question about the U.S. military's use of chemical weapons in Korea, saying: We investigated the U.S. imperialist crime of using chemical weapons in Korea. We have confirmed that two types of poison gas or chemical weapons have been used on the Korean battlefield. During the large-scale bombing of Nampo on May 6, 1951, U.S. planes used suffocating gas containing chlorine. In this bombing, 1,379 people were injured or killed, of which 487 died from suffocation and 647 were sick from suffocation. We spoke with many doctors and experts and conducted investigations with their help. They told us the test results, which proved that many people died from suffocation. People who witnessed the bombing testified to us how the bombs were dropped and how the poison gas spread. We also personally examined this suffocating gas bomb. The bombing of Nampo lasted for an hour and a half, and U.S. planes came four times. The first three times they did not use gas bombs, and only used them on the fourth time. Their purpose was to massacre more people. Because during the first three bombings by U.S. planes, women, children, and the elderly had entered the air-raid shelters, and the effect of poison gas in the air-raid shelters was greater than in open space, so many elderly people and women were harmed. In addition, we found in Hanpo and other places that U.S. planes used another type of poison gas bomb, which would cause burns, and then cause swelling and pimples on the body. The bombing of Hanpo was on July 6, 1951. The above-mentioned chemical weapons or poison gas have been confirmed to have been spread by the U.S. military. The victims of the above-mentioned cases were all peaceful residents, which proves that the United States uses chemical weapons or bacteriological weapons only for the large-scale massacre of civilians. Whether it is the use of chemical weapons or bacteriological weapons, it can be seen that it is a planned and systematic preparation. The use of chemical weapons by the United States violates international law, is a war crime, and is a crime against humanity.

Brazilian Representative De Brito made a statement:

The Korean People's Heroic and Just Struggle Will Surely Defeat the U.S. Aggressors in the End

Brazilian representative De Brito first described the events of the Brazilian people's opposition to their country's government's support of the U.S. aggression against Korea. He expressed his feelings about the heroic struggle of the Korean people, saying: Although the Korean people are fighting the enemy with superior weapons under extremely difficult conditions, the Korean people have the support of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world—including the Brazilian people. The Korean people will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors in the end, because this is a just struggle, a people's struggle, and a struggle to defend peace.

British Representative Gaster made a statement:

British Prisoners of War Received Cordial Treatment from the Chinese and Korean People, but U.S. Aggressors Bombed the Prisoner-of-War Camps

British representative Gaster described his visit to the prisoner-of-war camps of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. He said: I visited two prisoner-of-war camps and spoke with many British prisoners of war. I asked them if they had any complaints, but they had no complaints at all, only gratitude and praise. These prisoners of war are all healthy. Apart from maintaining the cleanliness of their own houses and surrounding areas, they have no other labor. They eat well and wear good clothes. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army seriously and conscientiously abide by the provisions of the international convention that the authorities of prisoners should give prisoners the opportunity to study. These ordinary British soldiers, ordinary British people, ask after studying: Why are they in the army? Why are you fighting Korea? Many people conclude that they should not have gone to Korea at all. They not only think about these questions, but also conclude that they should organize to bring peace to Korea and peace to the world. In every prisoner-of-war camp, there is a widespread peace movement. I talked a lot with the leaders of the peace movement. They asked me to tell their relatives and families why they participated in the peace movement. As one prisoner of war said, he now understands the Chinese people, or he thinks he has understood the Chinese people, because in his prisoner-of-war camp, there is no hostility, and the Chinese People's Volunteers are not their guards, but companions. In other words, they have learned that there is no reason for hatred between the two nations, and there should only be friendship. This is the best foundation for peace. Regarding the bombing of prisoner-of-war camps by U.S. planes, in fact, prisoners of war are in the safest place in Korea, but prisoner-of-war camps have been bombed twice this year. We also investigated this. One prisoner-of-war camp was bombed two days after our visit. After we arrived in Beijing, we received a letter from a prisoner of war to the delegation, describing the bombing in detail.

Polish Representative Wasilkowska spoke:

The U.S. Military's Mass Killing of the Korean People is a Crime that Legal Professionals Should Report to the World

Polish representative Wasilkowska reported to the reporters about the U.S. bombing of peaceful cities and towns in Korea and the atrocities of massacring peaceful people. She said: The U.S. imperialist massacre of the old, weak, women, and children, and the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and towns are not accidental personal acts, but systematic and planned atrocities. The largest massacres occurred in Shinchon and Sariwon in Hwanghae Province. In Shinchon, more than 35,000 people were massacred. We talked to a woman. She personally saw her husband and eleven children killed by U.S. imperialism. When she talked to us, she not only did not cry, but she first said that although my family only has me left, I will definitely fight resolutely. I believe our struggle will surely be victorious. Regarding bombing, we saw destroyed cities and villages everywhere. However, we saw that even under such difficult conditions, people still live the same way, and children still go to school. We look at these facts from a legal point of view. This crime is not only a war crime, but also a crime against humanity, a crime of murder! As a legal worker, a person, and someone engaged in the cause of defending peace, I demand punishment for this crime. We know that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has protested to the United Nations more than once about this crime of U.S. imperialism, but the United Nations has become a U.S. tool of aggression. Because of the United Nations' silence on this crime, our legal workers have a greater responsibility and a greater task. All members of our investigation team believe that our work has not yet been completed, and that the beginning of our work should be after we return to our country. We are fully aware of how huge the task before us is. This is not only the task before us, but also the task before the people of the world.

Belgian Representative Morrens firmly stated:

After Returning Home, We Will Widely Spread the Truth, Organize Protests and Rallies to Oppose U.S. Atrocities

Belgian representative Morrens answered the question of how the members of the delegation will expose the crimes of U.S. imperialism to their own people after returning home, saying: After we return home, we must carry out extensive publicity work. Taking Belgium as an example, we will organize protest rallies. All workers' organizations and democratic organizations will use their strength to spread the truth. We will especially point out that the crimes of U.S. imperialism are not accidental, but planned, and that its crimes are not only aimed at the people of Korea and China, but at all of humanity. The U.S. aggression against Korea is an attempt to use Korea as a springboard for aggression against Asia and aggression against the world. We want the Belgian people to know that the struggle of the people of Korea and China is not only a struggle for their own peace and independence, but also a struggle for world peace. We want to tell the Belgian people that for the struggle of the people of Korea and China, we must not only express sympathy in words, but we must take practical actions. Otherwise, what falls on the people of Korea and China today will fall on the people of Belgium tomorrow. By doing this, we are not only helping the people of Korea and China, but also helping world peace.

After answering the questions, delegation head Brandweiner, on behalf of the delegation, expressed gratitude to the Chinese people and the Korean people. He said: Without their help, our work would not have been possible.

Shen Junru gave the final speech. He pointed out: The delegation's efforts for justice are a great encouragement to the struggle of the Korean and Chinese people to defend peace, and a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在京举行记者招待会
    布兰德魏纳报告美军细菌战罪行调查结果
    抗议美国侵略者威胁世界和平的侵略行动
    【新华社二日讯】国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在四月一日举行记者招待会。到会的有新华通讯社、人民日报、光明日报、大公报、文汇报等报社记者二十二人，以及苏联真理报、苏联塔斯社、朝鲜中央通讯社、越南通讯社、英国伦敦工人日报等报社记者七人。中国政治法律学会筹备会沈钧儒、朝鲜最高检察所副检察总长蔡圭亨也参加了招待会。
    沈钧儒首先介绍调查团全体团员与中外记者见面。调查团团长布兰德魏纳接着向中国及外国记者发表了调查团在朝鲜和中国东北地区对美帝国主义细菌战罪行及其它罪行进行实地调查的结果。
    布兰德魏纳说：国际民主法律工作者协会调查团已经完成了调查美军在朝鲜及中国东北撒布细菌罪行的双重任务。我们要声明，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的任务不是要判决，因为它不是法院；只是为了调查事实，证明有这些暴行发生。基于这样的一个出发点，调查团在朝鲜调查之后，得出了下面的结论：
    一、在朝鲜的美国部队有意地撒布了苍蝇等带细菌的昆虫，对朝鲜人民军及北朝鲜和平居民构成了一个可怕的罪行，这些罪行违犯了一九○七年海牙公约关于陆战法规及惯例的条文；也违反了一九二五年日内瓦议定书里所重申的、国际公认的关于禁止使用细菌武器的法律。
    二、美国部队对朝鲜和平人民用了毒气弹及化学武器，美军就犯了有计划地、有意识地破坏一九○七年海牙章程（即海牙公约陆战法规及惯例条约附件关于陆战法规及惯例章程）第二十三条甲款与戊款的罪行。
    三、美军在其占领区，对平民或个人不经控诉、不经审判进行集体屠杀，其中包括许多妇女、儿童；他们就违反了一九○七年海牙章程第四十六条。
    四、美国部队及李承晚军任意逮捕、监禁、虐待在他们所占领地区的人民，再一次破坏了一九○七年海牙公约条款。
    五、美国部队对远离前线的不设防的城市乡村，进行轰炸，滥炸非军事目标，美军就再一次破坏了战争规则，尤其破坏了海牙章程。
    六、对于一些建筑物如教堂、美术馆、科学机关、历史性建筑及医院进行大量破坏。这些建筑物一般都有其独特的标志，不是军事目标。美国部队就再次破坏了海牙章程第二十七条。
    七、对于一些普通的非军事性的公共建筑物进行了有意的纵火、爆破，而这些行为并非战争所必需的，美军就破坏了海牙章程第五十五条。
    八、美国部队抢夺了人民的粮食财产，并未给予任何报酬及收据；或有意地破坏人民的财产和粮食。美军就再次破坏了海牙章程第四十六及五十二条。
    九、对战俘的屠杀，美国部队破坏了一九二九年及一九四九年的关于战俘待遇的公约。
    十、美国部队抢夺了有历史价值的艺术作品及私人财产，他们破坏了海牙章程第四十七条。
    调查团认为上述事实构成了纽伦堡国际军事法庭法规第六条所规定的战争罪行。
    布兰德魏纳强调说：鉴于这些事实，调查团认为必须把那些犯了罪的人们召至世界法庭面前。调查团毫不犹豫地声明：这样多的罪行有许多如果没有美国政府领袖和美军最高统帅充分知情和策划，这些罪行就不可能发生。
    因此，本调查团控告这些人，同时并控告那些在战场上对这些罪行直接负责的军官，以及一切接受并执行那些违反国际法的命令的士兵。我们得出这结论之后，便完成了国际民主法律工作者协会托附与我们的任务。
    我们觉得一定要说出：我们在朝鲜进行调查时的亲身经历，使我们对于揭发出来的野蛮暴行感到毛骨悚然和惊恐。我们知道，有许多人会不大肯相信我们这报告里所证实的可怖的事实，正如我们当中有许多人在这次调查之前，也对这些事实感到难以置信一样。因此，我们以法律工作者的名义，以一个普通的男子和妇女的名义，庄严地保证这些揭发出来的事实的真实性。我们来自不同的国家，我们的宗教信仰不同、政治见解不同，甚至语言也不相同。我们本着良心，充分意识到我们作为法律工作者的责任，尽我们的全部力量完成我们的任务。
    这个报告是我们工作的成果，是我们大家一致同意的。
    我们相信，任何人读到这个报告，都要和我们一样，对这些罪恶和罪犯们感到同样的毛骨悚然和憎恨。
    我们坚决相信，世界的正义公道必须加以维持，任何国家，任何个人，无论有多大的力量，也逃避不了他们罪恶应得的后果。
    正义必将伸张，为了保持正义，世界必须取得和平。
    我们希望，这个报告对争取世界和平的斗争将能有所贡献，特别是对朝鲜能有所贡献，朝鲜所遭受的痛苦是我们永远不能忘怀的，它应该迅速取得和平。
    我们最后要指出，我们深信，朝鲜的事情不能看作孤立的事件，而是一个危险战争发展的一个阶段，要是让它发展就会危害并牵涉到整个世界。对于进行细菌战这一类不人道的手段，我们必须认为，这表现了这些所谓文明国家的行径到了如何野蛮的程度，它们是会威胁到每一个男子、每一个妇女和孩子的。全体人民，只要是希望和平生活和得到自身安全的，都应该记住这个教训。和平是人民的财产，必须由人民自身积极斗争来加以保护。
    布兰德魏纳继就调查团在中国东北地区调查的结果说：调查团根据其搜集的文件及证据，确定了下列事实：
    一、一九五二年三月中，中国东北的南部各地（大部分距朝鲜边境很远），发现并证实了各类虫子的反常出现。
    二、在所有案例中，这些虫子的出现都是反常的，尤其是从季节，气温及从虫子仅集中于有限地区几点看来，更显见其反常性。
    三、在多类案件中，出事地点都发现了羽毛，羽毛的出现不能不认为是反常的。
    四、在大多数案例中，化验的结果及用豚鼠和小白鼠实验的结果，证明这些昆虫及羽毛带有各种病菌，巴斯德杆菌、炭疽菌、伤寒菌、立克次氏体及脑炎病毒。
    五、在调查团调查过的九件案例中，已肯定美国飞机曾在发现虫子或羽毛的当天或前几天飞经这些地区。
    六、在许多案例中，证人曾见到美国飞机投下东西，在一件案例中，已发现显然是装虫子用的容器的碎片。
    布兰德魏纳指出：调查团认为：这些带菌的虫子及羽毛只能是美国飞机载运到这些地区来的，而美机既无权利，亦无任何理由飞入中国东北领土。
    从调查团在朝鲜调查时所得的事实得到这样的一个结论，那么这个结论就更为有力了。在朝鲜调查后所作的报告已特别指出发现有英文标记的特种炸弹的碎片，并已确定美军在朝鲜撒布带菌昆虫，在中国所发现的带菌昆虫，许多是与在朝鲜所发现的相同的。
    使用细菌武器是战争法及战争惯例所禁止的。一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书肯定了这项禁令。当武装部队冲突并不存在时，这项禁令当然更为适用。
    纽伦堡国际军事法庭的法规（不分战争或和平状态）也宣称：杀害或消灭平民乃是反对人类的罪行。
    凡蓄意摧毁一个民族或种族的全部或一部分，而对该人群实行或企图实行杀害或严重伤害者，不论战时或平时，一九四八年十二月九日通过的“防止并惩办集体屠杀罪公约”都是肯定地适用的。我们认为上述事实已构成美国的侵略行为及残杀人类行为，也是一个反人类的可憎罪行。因此，这确实已成为对全世界的一个极端严重的威胁，其范围及其后果实未可预测。
    我们的坚定意见是以事实为根据的，这些事实我们本着法学工作的严格性及我们的责任感加以证实。
    布兰德魏纳最后说：作为一个法学工作者，我们对这种违反国际法的行动提出严正抗议，反对这些破坏国际公法的行为，作为一个爱好和平民主的分子，我们谴责美国这种威胁世界和平的侵略行动；作为一个普通人，我们对这种为罪恶的目的而骇人听闻地利用科学的进步表示极大的愤怒。
    布兰德魏纳团长发言完毕后，调查团团员柯伯年宣布，世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若从奥斯陆发来电报说：布兰德魏纳三月二十九日的电报已经收到了，谨代表世界和平理事会执行局表示谢意。这个消息引起了到会人们的热烈的鼓掌。到会的中外记者随即提出若干问题，由调查团各团员分别作答。
    法代表贾斯盖答复问题时指出
    中朝人民反对细菌战的斗争必定能粉碎美国的罪恶企图
    法国代表贾斯盖在答复调查团对中朝人民反对美国细菌战的斗争印象如何的问题时说：美国以使用细菌武器来恫吓朝鲜和中国的人民的罪恶企图必将失败。中国人民和朝鲜人民很镇静地来对付美帝国主义这一惨无人道的使用细菌武器的罪行。政府当局所采取的防疫措施是有效的。在我们亲身调查的某些地方，当地人民发现了毒虫，就立即报告政府，政府立即采取措施，因此防止了细菌战的恶果。我们确信美帝国主义决不可能达到他们的罪恶企图。
    贾斯盖回答调查团对于专家们化验美机撒下的带菌昆虫的结果有何意见时说：调查团在东北调查时，曾和十一位著名的科学家谈过话。我们曾参观了试验室，看他们怎样进行试验。虽然我们不是科学家，但是，我们看得出科学家们是怎样认真细心地进行着工作。这些专家曾告诉我们，他们分析化验的结果证明这些昆虫都带有极危险的传染病。这些证据是科学的、不可辩驳的。
    意大利代表卡瓦莱里发表谈话
    证实侵朝美军使用化学武器屠杀和平居民违反国际公法
    意大利代表、调查团副团长卡瓦莱里答复关于美军在朝鲜使用化学武器的问题说：我们在朝鲜曾对美帝国主义使用化学武器的罪行进行了调查。我们已证实了在朝鲜战场上已使用了两种毒气或化学武器。一九五一年五月六日对南浦的大轰炸中，美机曾使用窒息性毒气，其中含有氯气成份。这次轰炸中，有一千三百七十九人伤亡，其中四百八十七人是因窒息而死的，六百四十七人因窒息而病。我们曾和许多医师和专家谈过话，在他们帮助之下进行调查。他们把检验结果告诉我们，证明许多人是因为窒息致死的。亲眼看见投弹的人向我们证明炸弹如何投下，毒气如何散布开来。我们并曾亲自检查了这种窒息性毒气弹。南浦这次轰炸延长达一小时半，美机共来四次，前三次没有用毒气弹，第四次来时才用。它们的目的是更多地屠杀人民。因为在美机前三次来轰炸时，妇孺老幼都进了防空洞，而毒气在防空洞中所起的作用比在空间更大，所以许多老人、妇女受了害。此外，我们在汉浦等地发现美机使用另一种毒气弹，这种毒气弹会造成灼伤的效果，后来就使人身上发肿，起豆状颗粒。对汉浦的那次轰炸是在一九五一年七月六日。上述化学武器或毒气都已经证实是美军所散布的。上述案件受害者都是和平居民，这就证明了美国使用化学武器或细菌武器，只是为了大规模屠杀平民。无论是使用化学武器还是细菌武器，都可以看得出是经过有计划、有系统的准备的。美国使用化学武器是违反国际公法的，是战争罪行，又是反人类的罪行。
    巴西代表狄布里托发表谈话
    朝鲜人民英勇的正义的斗争最后一定能击败美国侵略者
    巴西代表狄布里托在答复问题时首先叙述了巴西人民反对该国政府支持美国侵略朝鲜的斗争事迹。他就朝鲜人民的英勇斗争发表感想说：虽然朝鲜人民是在极困难的条件下，跟掌握优势武器的敌人作战，但是，朝鲜人民有着中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民——包括巴西人民的支援。朝鲜人民最后一定能击败美国侵略者，因为这是正义的斗争，人民的斗争，保卫和平的斗争。
    英国代表加斯特尔发表谈话
    英籍战俘受到中朝人民宽待美国侵略者却轰炸了战俘营
    英国代表加斯特尔叙述了他访问朝中人民军队战俘营的情形。他说：我访问了两个战俘营，并和许多英籍战俘谈话。我问他们有没有不满意的地方，他们根本没有不满之处，只有感谢和称赞。这些战俘都很健康。除了只要把他们自己房子和周围地区维持清洁外，他们没有其他劳务。他们吃得很好，穿的衣服也很好。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军严肃认真地遵守关于俘虏当局应该使俘虏能有机会学习的国际公约的规定。这些普通的英国兵、普通的英国人在学习之后就发问：为什么自己在军队中？为什么要打朝鲜？很多人得到结论说：他们根本不应该到朝鲜。他们不仅想这些问题，而且得出结论：应该组织起来，使朝鲜得到和平，使世界得到和平。在每一俘虏营中，都有广泛的和平运动。我跟和平运动的领袖谈过许多话。他们请求我告诉他们的亲戚家庭为什么他们参加和平运动。正如一个战俘所讲的，他现在了解中国人民，或者他认为自己已了解中国人民，因为在他的那个战俘营中，没有敌对关系，中国人民志愿军不是他们的看守人，而是同伴。换言之，他们已学习到在两民族间没有理由存在仇恨，而只应该存在友好。这是和平的最良好的基础。关于美机轰炸战俘营的事，事实上战俘是处在朝鲜最安全之处，但是，战俘营在今年中受到了两次轰炸。我们对此也进行了调查。有一个俘虏营在我们访问之后两天受到了轰炸。我们到北京之后，收到一个战俘给调查团的一封信，向我们详细地叙述了轰炸经过。
    波兰代表华西尔考夫斯卡谈话
    美军大批屠杀朝鲜人民罪行法律工作者应向全世界报道
    波兰代表华西尔考夫斯卡向记者们报告了美国在朝鲜轰炸和平城乡、屠杀和平人民的暴行。她说：美帝国主义屠杀老弱妇女、滥炸和平城乡不是偶然的个人的行为，而是有系统有计划的暴行。最大的屠杀曾在黄海道信川和沙里院发生过。在信川，被屠杀者有三万五千多人。我们曾跟一个妇女谈过话。她亲眼看到她的丈夫和十一个孩子被美帝国主义杀死。她在跟我们谈话时不仅不哭泣，她首先表示，虽然我的家庭只剩下了我一个人，但是我一定坚决斗争。我相信我们的斗争一定能得到胜利。关于轰炸，我们到处看到炸毁的城市和乡村。可是，我们看到就是在这样困难的条件下人们还照样生活，孩子还在上学。我们从法律上来看这些事实，这种罪行不仅是战争罪行，而且是反人类的罪行、杀人的罪行！我们作为一个法律工作者，一个人，一个从事于保卫和平事业的人，要求惩罚这种罪行。我们知道朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾不止一次地向联合国抗议美帝国主义的这种罪行，但是，联合国已成为美国侵略工具。由于联合国对于这个罪行的缄默，我们法律工作者责任就更重，任务更大。我们调查团团员都认为我们的工作还没有完成，我们工作的开始应该是在我们回到本国以后，我们完全自觉摆在我们面前的任务是多么巨大。这不但是摆在我们面前的任务，而且也是摆在全世界人民面前的任务。
    比利时代表莫伦斯坚决表示
    回国后决广泛传布事实真相组织抗议集会反对美国暴行
    比利时代表莫伦斯回答关于调查团团员回国后如何向本国人民揭发美帝国主义罪行的问题说：我们回国之后，一定要进行广泛的宣传工作。以比利时来说，我们将组织抗议集会。一切工人组织、民主组织将运用他们的力量，传布事实的真相。我们将特别指出：美帝国主义的罪行不是偶然的，而是有计划的，它的罪行不仅针对朝中人民，而且是针对全人类的罪行。美国侵略朝鲜是想把朝鲜作为侵略亚洲、侵略世界的跳板。我们要使比利时人民知道：朝中人民的斗争不仅是为他们自己的和平独立而斗争，而且是为全世界和平而斗争。我们要告诉比利时人民：对于朝中人民的斗争，不仅要用言语表示同情，而且必须采取实际行动。否则，今天落在朝中人民身上的，明天就要落在比利时人民身上。我们这样做，不仅是帮助了朝中人民，而且是帮助了世界和平。
    在答复问题后，调查团团长布兰德魏纳代表调查团，对中国人民和朝鲜人民表示感谢。他说：如果没有他们的帮助，我们的工作是不可能完成的。
    沈钧儒最后致词。他指出：调查团为正义而作的努力，对于朝中人民保卫和平的斗争，是极大的鼓舞，对全世界的和平事业有很大的贡献。
