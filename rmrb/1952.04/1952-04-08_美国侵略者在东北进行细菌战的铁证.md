    Ironclad Evidence of American Aggressors Conducting Germ Warfare in Northeast China
    Jiang Heng
    Having suffered defeats in Korea, the American aggressors, in an attempt to salvage their hopeless situation, disregarded international law and human morality. Following the scattering of poisonous insects in Korea on January 28th, they openly conducted inhumane germ warfare in Northeast China, starting from February 29th.
    As a member of the Chinese and foreign journalists' delegation, I have conducted on-the-spot investigations for a week and have obtained much ironclad evidence. This evidence proves that the germ warfare conducted by the American aggressors in Northeast China is an undeniable fact.
    As everyone knows, bacteriological weapons, like chemical weapons and atomic weapons, are the most cruel and inhumane weapons, and are absolutely prohibited by international law. However, the American murderers are using this weapon to carry out their heinous aggression in the Northeast region of our country.
    In order to exonerate themselves from the crime of conducting germ warfare, the American aggressors have shamelessly argued that this is because "China is full of rats and fleas carrying germs." But what are the facts?
        Let us first look at how the germ-carrying insects and poisons appeared on our territory. This was explained by the results of my investigations among the masses in Shenyang, Fushun, Andong, Kuandian and other places: They were all discovered shortly after American aggressor military aircraft invaded our Northeast airspace. According to statistics from the Northeast Air Defense Agency, from February 29th to March 21st, within 22 days, there were as many as 175 sorties and 955 aircraft of American aggressor military aircraft that invaded the Northeast airspace. The American murderers used so many aircraft to bring poisonous insects and poisons from across the Sea of Japan, from across the Pacific Ocean, to our country. Until recently - on the morning of March 24th, on our way from Andong to Kuandian, we personally saw two American military aircraft invading the airspace over Andong City and scattering poultry feathers carrying germs in the Liudaogou area of the city. The results of our on-site investigation on the afternoon of the 25th fully confirmed this. Li Weida and others, who witnessed the American planes scattering poultry feathers, held up a bottle of poultry feathers they had picked up and angrily accused the American murderers of their heinous crimes. Li Weida said that Chen Xiuying and I discovered two American planes flying from the northeast to the southwest at 9:45 a.m., and saw white things like snowflakes floating down in the sky 1,500 meters above the ground, piece by piece. Soon, we found a lot of poultry feathers in an area 1,500 meters long and 500 meters wide. Obviously, these poisons were brought by American military aircraft, which has become an indisputable fact. No matter how shamelessly Acheson denies and sophists, he cannot exonerate the American criminal act of invading our airspace and conducting germ warfare.
        How were the germ-carrying insects and poisons spread on our territory? Did the United States use bacteriological bomb weapons? The materials I collected on the front line of the anti-bacteriological war in Northeast China this time gave me an affirmative answer, and I personally saw various weapons for throwing germ-carrying insects. On March 24th, we clearly saw broken pieces of a plaster-like silver-gray bacteriological bomb, poisonous insects jumping around, and chicken feathers scattered near the bomb crater in a cornfield two li east of Kuandian City. Faced with such a specially made bacteriological bomb by the United States, the big rogue Acheson sophistically said: "The United Nations forces have not conducted and are not conducting any kind of germ warfare in the past," how shameful is this! The American murderers using bacteriological bombs to throw germ-carrying insects is just one of the many ways to spread germs. In the "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of American Imperialism Conducting Germ Warfare in Northeast China" held in Andong and Shenyang, I also personally saw several kinds of bacteriological weapons such as reddish-brown capsules, cloth-like objects, paper tube-like objects and cloth bags thrown in Niumaowu Village in Kuandian County, Taihou Village in Qingyuan County, on the slopes of Changdian, Hongbigou Village in Zhuanghe County, and Langtou.
    These bacteriological weapons are not all or the main weapons used by the United States in germ warfare. According to the results of my investigation in the above-mentioned areas, I found that many of the germ-carrying insects that were thrown down were either attached to some unnoticed items or directly scattered from the plane. The latter method is more insidious, because it can throw a large number of poisonous insects on the ground and cover up the crimes of murder. Obviously, there is no need to prove that this is a special pulverizer adopted by the American murderers who inherited the mantle of the Japanese germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii. Everyone knows that when the Ishii Unit invaded Central China in 1940, it used a pulverizer attached to the wings of the plane to scatter many fleas. Kiyoshi Kawashima, Director of the General Affairs Department of Unit 731 of the Kwantung Army of Japan during the war, also confessed that in the summer of 1941, planes were used to throw fleas carrying plague bacilli in the Changde area, without using bacteriological bombs. Therefore, in addition to using bacteriological bombs, the American murderers also adopted the method of directly scattering germ-carrying insects by plane. Of course, this can only show their inhumanity and extreme madness, and cannot cover up their bloody crimes of massacring mankind in the slightest. Because this "secret" is no longer a secret. The fact that a large number of germ-carrying insects were found in Shenyang Old Station and other places after the American planes passed by also forcefully exposed this secret. At the same time, I also personally saw poultry feathers, cotton balls, beef jerky (wrapped in paper with the Kuomintang party flag printed on it), corn leaves, sorghum leaves, oak leaves, chestnut leaves, pear leaves, pine leaves, grass, cowpeas, and grayish-white mice with germs and viruses attached to them thrown down by American planes in Fushun, Andong, Kuandian and other places, as well as in the "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence." This provides sufficient evidence to show that the American murderers used various tangible and intangible containers and attached objects carrying germs and viruses to spread germs in their germ warfare.
    The bacteria scattered by American aerial bandits using various methods, as far as I have personally seen and examined by experts in various disciplines, include centipedes, locusts, sandflies, grasshoppers, earthworms, small beetle bugs, hard-shelled bugs, ladybugs, caterpillars, bees, butterflies, ants, house centipedes, grasshoppers, bumblebees, ticks, toads, crickets, etc., about twenty or thirty kinds. And the most widely and commonly scattered are flies, mosquitoes, springtails (i.e., small black bugs), fleas, spiders, lice, bedbugs, etc. The large number of these germ-carrying insects is not only proven by the frequent invasion of our Northeast airspace by American aircraft, and the various bacteriological weapons and poisons that have been discovered were scattered by American aggressors, but also proven by the season and climate in which these poisonous insects appear, and the shape and types of some of the poisonous insects. When we arrived in Fushun on March 22nd, although it was more than half a month later than the time the poisonous insects were discovered, the season and climate at that time were still freezing cold and snowy. In such a season and climate, anyone with a little common sense would not believe that so many insects were born, and many of these poisonous insects had never appeared in the local area of Northeast China, or were similar in shape but different in habits and sizes. Sun Qingfu, a 77-year-old farmer from Shanzhaizi Village, Jiuzhan, and Zhao Peihua, a 49-year-old woman from Xintun, Fushun, both told the journalists' delegation: I have lived so old, I have never seen this kind of black springtail, nor have I seen so many insects born in such cold weather. But now, this kind of black springtail that has never been seen before appears in large numbers on ice and snow, in ditches, and even on the roofs of buildings. Then what reason does the American aggressor have to slander that this is grown on the Chinese mainland, and not specially manufactured indoors and scattered by planes in the United States? I also saw in many places that some insects were not exactly the same as those grown in Northeast China, and could not be born outdoors in large numbers in cold weather. For example, the mosquitoes scattered by American aircraft in Fushun are: larger than ordinary mosquitoes, with black spots on their wings; and in Andong, mosquito eggs were found on stones and leaves. What about flies? Some have hair all over their bodies, some are white, and some have small heads and long wings. The special habits and strange shapes of these insects are all sufficient to prove that they are products of the American germ warfare factory and were scattered by American aircraft. More importantly, these insects and poisons, after being tested by experts in various disciplines, carry various germs and viruses; and in Anshan and other cities, because people did not pay attention to the extermination of poisonous insects at the beginning, there have been many cases of people and animals dying from being infected with germs. Let me give a few examples of the inspections: In the "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence" held in Shenyang, I personally saw that the winter mosquitoes scattered by American planes in Anshan on March 2nd carried the acute encephalitis virus. Experts Li Peilin, Xu Yingkui, Zhu Jiming, Zhang Xuede, Wu Zhizhong, Jing Guanhua and others determined that this is a kind of encephalitis virus that has never been found in our country. I also saw that the black springtails dropped by American planes in Jiuzhan, Shenyang City on February 29th were found to contain Rickettsia by bacteriological experts Zhu Jiming and Wei Wenbin. This is the pathogen of a class of diseases such as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever that seriously endanger human beings. The large flies dropped by American planes in Shenyang City on March 15th were found to contain typhoid bacilli by bacteriological expert Jing Guanhua. This kind of bacteria is the pathogen of typhoid fever, which seriously endangers human beings. American germ warfare apologists have repeatedly said that spiders are "beneficial insects" in order to cover up their crimes of conducting germ warfare. However, according to the inspections of bacteriological expert Jing Guanhua and Han Pengtai, Dean of Andong Municipal Hospital, in Shenyang and Andong, even this kind of "beneficial insect" has been "painstakingly" cultivated by American germ warfare criminals and carries pathogenic bipolar staining bacilli (i.e., Pasteurella. Plague bacteria and the bacteria of hemorrhagic septicemia of chickens and ducks also belong to this type of bacteria). For example, poultry feathers were originally ordinary objects, but the poultry feathers scattered by American planes in Beijingzi Village, Andong were proven to contain anthrax bacilli by bacteriological experts Xin Jun, Jing Guanhua, Zhao Chenglin and others.
    There is no need to list more materials. The above series of vivid facts have given me sufficient evidence to enable me to confidently conclude that: American aggressor military aircraft frequently invade our Northeast airspace, scatter a large number of germ-carrying insects and poisons with various bacteriological weapons, and conduct inhumane germ warfare, which is already irrefutable evidence. Facts speak louder than words. No matter how shamelessly Acheson and his little buddy Eden, and his echoers in the United Nations, deny, deny, and cover up, they cannot wash away the blood on their hands!
    The results of my on-the-spot inspection in the Northeast poisonous insect area this time can also draw a second conclusion, that the United States has not achieved the expected results of its germ warfare. The American rogues vainly attempted to cause an epidemic of infectious diseases in Northeast China, vainly attempted to plunge the entire China into the terror of germ warfare. In fact, this has proven to be futile. What I saw in Northeast China was not only not as those rogues said, "China has been plagued by epidemics for centuries," "epidemics are inevitable," "epidemics are rampant on the Chinese mainland"; moreover, even in the case of the United States scattering a large number of poisonous insects, it did not cause any epidemic.
    This is not because of Acheson and his ilk's "compassion", scattering insects that did not carry germs, nor is it because the insects carrying germs did not have the ability to infect; but because the awakened people of Northeast China have organized and formed a strong anti-bacteriological warfare and people's mass epidemic prevention front. Therefore, the Chinese people are fully capable of winning the victory of the anti-bacteriological war, which is the third conclusion I have drawn after my on-the-spot inspection.
    As far as Shenyang, Fushun, Jiuzhan, Andong, Kuandian and other places I have visited this time are concerned, everywhere on the streets and in the fields, one can see masses of men, women, old and young, conducting epidemic prevention work in groups, exterminating the evil poisonous insects, and they held anti-bacteriological war parades. Their slogans are: "Killing a poisonous insect is equivalent to eliminating an American devil!" "No rats in every household, no insects in every household!" These slogans have become the combat actions of the broad masses of the people. Jiao Damao, director of the Women's Federation of the Second Street, Third District of Andong City, and Women's Committee members Fu Guilan and Li Shuyu mobilized 3,000 women in the entire street to participate in the epidemic prevention battle. They hate and despise the barbaric aggression of American imperialism. Wherever the Chinese and foreign journalists' delegation went, the masses sent representatives to accuse the American murderers of their crimes, asking us to appeal to the people of the world to mobilize the people of the world to sanction the organizers and executors of the American bacteriological war, and expressed that they are fully capable of winning the victory of the anti-bacteriological war. Wang Shirong, a 51-year-old forest ranger from Xintun, Fushun, said: "The American devils want to harm innocent civilians, we must never spare them. Even I, an old man, must join the battle. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have a complete way to wipe it out!" This is the voice of thousands of people in Northeast China, and this voice warns the American murderers that if they do not withdraw their bloody hands of massacring mankind, the fate of destruction of Japanese imperialism is waiting for them. Their disastrous situation and the fate of death are by no means something that poisonous insects can save!

    美国侵略者在东北进行细菌战的铁证
    江横
    美国侵略者在朝鲜吃了败仗，为了挽救它无法挽救的败局，竟不顾国际公法和人类道德，继一月二十八日在朝鲜撒布毒虫之后，又从二月二十九日起，公然在我国东北连续地进行了灭绝人性的细菌战争。
    我是中外记者团的成员之一，经过一周来的实地调查，我们已经获得了许多铁的事实，这些事实证明了：美国侵略者在我国东北所进行的细菌战，是千真万确的事实。
    尽人皆知，细菌武器和化学武器、原子武器一样，是最残酷最不人道的武器，也是为国际公法所绝对禁止的武器。但美国杀人犯在我国东北地区却正使用这种武器进行着罪恶的侵略。
    美国侵略者为开脱进行细菌战的罪责，曾厚颜无耻地狡辩这是由于“中国充满了带有病菌的老鼠和跳蚤”。但是，事实是怎样的呢？
        我们先来看一看带菌的昆虫和毒物是怎样在我国领土上出现的。这在我访问沈阳、抚顺、安东、宽甸等
    地向群众进行调查的结果得到了说明：这都是美国侵略军军用飞机侵入我东北领空后不久发现的。据东北防空机构的统计，从二月二十九日至三月二十
    一日的二十二天中，侵入东北领空的美国侵略军军用飞机，即有一百七十五批，九百五十五架次之多。美国杀人犯就是用了这末多架次的飞机，把毒虫和毒物从日本海那边，从太平洋那边带到我们国土上的。直到最近——三月二十四日的上午，在我们离开安东前往宽甸的途中，也还亲眼看到两架美国军用飞机侵入安东市上空，并在市区六道沟一带撒布了带有病菌的禽类羽毛。二十五日下午，我们赴现场调查的结果，也完全证实了这件事。目击美机撒下禽类羽毛的李维达等人，手里举着他们拣到的一瓶禽类羽毛，曾向我们愤怒地控诉了美国杀人犯的滔天罪行。李维达说，我和陈秀英在上午九时四十五分发现了美机两架从东北方向飞向西南时，便看见距地面一千五百公尺的上空，游荡着像雪花一样的白色东西，一片一片地飘落下来。不久我们就在长一千五百公尺，宽五百公尺的面积中发现了很多禽类羽毛。很显然，这些毒物是由美国军用飞机带来的，这已成为无可置辩的事实了。尽管艾奇逊如何无耻地狡赖和诡辩，也丝毫不能开脱美国侵略我国领空进行细菌战的犯罪行为。
        带菌的昆虫和毒物是怎样撒布到我们国土上的？美国是否用了细菌弹武器？这次我在东北反细菌战的前线上所收集的材料，给了我以肯定的回答，而且，我亲眼看到了投掷带菌昆虫的各种武器。三月二十四日，我们曾在距宽甸城东二里远的苞米地内，清晰地看到已炸碎的细菌弹的类似石膏质银灰色碎片，在周围飞跳的毒虫，和散集在弹坑附近的鸡毛。面对着美国特制的这样的细菌弹，大流氓艾奇逊曾狡赖说：“联合国军过去未进行现在也未进行任何种细菌战”，这是怎样的可耻！美国杀人犯用细菌炸弹投掷带菌的昆虫，还仅仅是撒布细菌的许多方式之一。在安东、沈阳所举办的“美帝国主义在东北进行细菌战的罪证陈列室”内，我还亲眼看到投掷在宽甸县牛毛坞村、清原县台后村、长甸山坡上、庄河县红鼻沟村和浪头的红褐色胶囊、胶布样物、纸筒样物和布包等数种细菌武器。
    这些细菌武器，也还不是美国进行细菌战的全部或主要武器。据我在上述地区调查的结果，发现很多被投掷下来的带菌的昆虫，不是附着在一些人不注意的物品上，就是在飞机上直接撒布下来的。后一方法更为恶毒，它可以把大量毒虫投掷在地上，而又可以掩盖杀人的罪迹。显然用不着证明，这是美国杀人犯继承日本细菌战犯石井四郎的衣钵所采用的一种特制的粉碎器。谁都知道，石井部队在一九四○年进犯华中时，就是用粉碎器结在飞机的翅膀上，把许多跳蚤撒布下来的。战时日本关东军第七三一部队总务部部长川岛清也这样供称：一九四一年夏天，在常德一带，就是用飞机把带有鼠疫杆菌的跳蚤投掷下去的，并没有用细菌炸弹。所以，美国杀人犯除采用细菌炸弹外，还采用了以飞机直接撒布带菌昆虫的方法。当然这只能说明他们灭绝人性和绝顶疯狂，并不能丝毫掩盖他们屠杀人类的血腥罪迹。因为，这个“秘密”已经不成为什么秘密了。而在沈阳旧站等地美国飞机过后所发现的大量带菌昆虫这一事实，也有力地揭露了这一秘密。同时，我在抚顺、安东、宽甸等地，以及“罪证陈列室”内，还亲眼看到美国飞机投掷下来的附有病菌和病毒的禽类羽毛、棉球、牛肉干（包着印有国民党党旗的纸皮）、苞米叶、高粱叶、柞树叶、栗子树叶、梨树叶、松树叶、草、豆角、灰白色小鼠等附着物。这就有足够的证据说明，美国杀人犯进行细菌战，是采用了各种有形无形的容器，和带有病菌病毒的附着物来撒布细菌的。
    美国空中强盗用各种方法撒布下来的细菌，就我亲眼看到的，并经各科专家检验者，约计有蜈蚣、蜢虫、白蛉子、蝗虫、蚯蚓、小甲盖虫、硬盖虫、花大姐、毛毛虫、蜜蜂、蝴蝶、蚂蚁、蚰蜒、蚂蚱、土蜂、壁虱、蛤蟆、蟋蟀等二、三十种之多。而撒布数量最多最普遍的则是苍蝇、蚊子、跳虫（即小黑虫）、跳蚤、蜘蛛、虱子、臭虫等。对于这些带菌昆虫的大量出现，不仅有频繁的美国飞机侵入我东北领空，和已发现的各种细菌武器及毒物证明着是美国侵略者所撒布的，而且根据这些毒虫出现的季节、气候和某些毒虫的形态、种类，也证明着是美国侵略者所撒布的。三月二十二日我们到达抚顺时，虽说距发现毒虫的时间已迟了半月多，但这时的季节、气候，还依然是天寒地冻、大雪纷纷的时候。在这样的季节和气候里，稍有普通常识的人，都不会相信有这么大量昆虫的出生，而且其中有许多毒虫是东北当地从未出现过或形状类似，而习性，大小却不相同的。旧站山崴子村七十七岁的老农孙庆福，和抚顺新屯四十九岁的老妇赵佩华，都向记者团说：我活了这末老，既没见过这种黑跳虫，也没见过在这样的冷天能出生这末多的虫子。但是现在这种从未见过的黑跳虫，竟然大量出现在冰雪上，水沟中，甚至楼房顶上。那末美国侵略者还有什么理由诬赖这是中国本土生长，而不是美国特别室内制造和飞机撒布的呢？我还在不少地方看到有些昆虫和东北生长的也不尽相同，而且也不是冷天在室外所能大量出生的。例如，经过美国飞机撒布的蚊子，在抚顺是：比一般的蚊子大，翅上有黑色斑点；在安东更发现石头上、树叶上有蚊子所产的卵。苍蝇呢？有的全身是毛，有的身呈白色，有的头小翅长。这些昆虫习性的特殊，体形的怪异，无一不足以证明这是美国细菌战工厂的出品，而由美国飞机撒布下来的。更重要的是，这些昆虫和毒物经过各科专家的检验，是带有各种病菌和病毒的；并且在鞍山及其他城市由于开始时没有注意扑灭毒虫，因染受病菌而致死的人畜，已有多起。下面让我举几个检验的例子吧：在沈阳举办的“罪证陈列室”内，我曾亲眼看到三月二日美国飞机在鞍山所撒布的冬大蚊带有急性脑炎病毒。经专家李佩琳、许英魁、朱既明、张学德、吴执中、景冠华等的检验判明，这是我国从未发现过的一种脑炎病毒。我还看到，二月二十九日美国飞机在沈阳市旧站投下的黑跳虫，经细菌学专家朱既明、魏文彬检验，查出了立克次氏体。这是严重危害人类的斑疹伤寒、珞玑山斑点热等一类病症的病原体。三月十五日美机在沈阳市投下的大家蝇，经细菌学专家景冠华检验，查出了伤寒杆菌。这类病菌是严重危害人类的伤寒病的病原体。美国细菌战辩护者曾多次说蜘蛛是“益虫”，借以掩饰他们进行细菌战的罪行。但根据细菌学专家景冠华和安东市立医院院长韩蓬台在沈阳、安东的检验，就连这种“益虫”都经美国细菌战犯的“苦心”培养，而带有致病力的两端浓染杆菌（即巴斯德属杆菌。鼠疫病菌及鸡、鸭出血性败血病的病菌，也属于这类杆菌）。再如，禽类羽毛原也是通常的物体，但美国飞机在安东北井子村所撒布下来的禽类羽毛，经细菌学专家辛钧、景冠华、赵成林等的检验证明，都带有炭疽杆菌。
    用不着列举更多的材料，上述一系列的活生生的事实，已给了我充分的证据，使我有把握得出结论说：美国侵略军军用飞机频繁地侵入我国东北领空，用各式各样的细菌武器撒布着大量带菌的昆虫和毒物，进行着灭绝人性的细菌战，已经是铁证如山了。事实胜于雄辩，艾奇逊和他的小伙计艾登，以及他在联合国中的应声虫们，不管如何厚颜无耻地狡辩抵赖和掩饰，也洗刷不掉他们满手的血迹！
    我这次在东北毒虫地区实地视察的结果，还可以得出第二个结论说，美国并没有达到它进行细菌战的预期效果。美国的恶汉们妄图在我国东北造成传染病的流行，妄图把整个中国投入细菌战争的恐怖中，事实上，这已经证明是徒劳的了。我所看到的东北，不仅没有像那些流氓所说，“中国闹疫病已经多少世纪了”，“瘟疫是不可避免的”，“中国大陆疫疠盛行”；而且，就是在美国大量撒布毒虫的情况下，也没有引起什么瘟疫的流行。
    这倒不是因为艾奇逊们的“慈悲”，撒布了没有带菌的昆虫，也不是带菌的昆虫没有传染的能力；而是因为觉醒了的东北人民，已经组织起来，结成了反细菌战的、人民群众的强固防疫战线。因此中国人民完全有力量取得反细菌战的胜利，这就是我实地视察后所得出的第三个结论。
    就我这次到过的沈阳、抚顺、旧站、安东、宽甸等地来说，在街上、田野里到处都可以看到男女老少群众，成群结队地进行防疫工作，扑灭万恶的毒虫，他们并举行了反细菌战的游行示威。他们的口号是：“打死一个毒虫，就等于消灭一个美国鬼子！”“家家无鼠，家家无虫！”这些口号已变成广大人民群众的战斗行动。安东市三区二街妇女主任缴大娘和妇女委员傅贵兰、李书玉发动全街三千妇女参加了防疫战斗。他们仇恨、敌视美帝国主义的蛮横侵略行为。中外记者团所到的地方，群众都派代表控诉了美国杀人犯的罪行，要求我们向全世界人民发出呼吁，动员全世界人民起来制裁美国细菌战的组织者和执行者，并表示他们完全能够取得反细菌战的胜利。抚顺新屯五十一岁的老护林员王世荣就这样表示：“美国鬼子要暗害无辜平民，我们绝对不能饶过他们。就连我这老头子也要参加战斗。我们在毛主席的领导下，完全有办法扑灭它！”这是千万东北人民的声音，这声音警告着美国杀人犯，如果他们不收回屠杀人类的血腥魔手，日本帝国主义的毁灭的命运正等待着他们。他们的惨败局面和注定要死亡的命运，决不是什么毒虫所能挽救得了的！
