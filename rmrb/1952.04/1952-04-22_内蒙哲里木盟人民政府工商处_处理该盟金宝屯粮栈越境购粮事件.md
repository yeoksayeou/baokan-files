    The Industry and Commerce Department of the Zhelimumeng People's Government in Inner Mongolia
    Handles the Jinbaotun Grain Depot's Cross-Border Grain Purchase Incident
    Editor: After your newspaper published Comrade Liu Xun's critical letter regarding our Zhelimumeng Jinbaotun Grain Depot's cross-border purchase of rice from the Zhongchao Rice Mill, a private merchant in Shuangliao County, Liaoning Province, the person in charge of the grain depot has recognized the mistake and requested punishment from the leadership. According to our understanding, the person in charge of the grain depot initially ordered grain from our league's grain company, but it was not approved. Later, they discussed with Huang Hengpu, the manager of the league's grain company, to purchase grain across the border in Liaoning. They neither went through the local government's industry and commerce administrative departments nor purchased according to the state-owned companies' listed prices. This is a violation of state policy. Now, in addition to giving the person in charge of the grain depot a warning and continuing to investigate his relationship with private merchants, we plan to severely punish Huang Hengpu, the manager of the league's grain company (a corrupt element who refused to confess during the "Three-Anti" movement and has been detained in court), to educate our other grain depot staff stationed outside.

    处理该盟金宝屯粮栈越境购粮事件
    编辑同志：你报刊载了刘讯同志对我盟金宝屯粮栈越境到辽西省双辽县向私商中朝制米厂订购大米的批评信后，该粮栈负责人已认识错误，并请求领导方面给予处分。根据我们了解，该粮栈负责人起初曾向我盟粮食公司订购粮食，但未被批准，后又与盟粮食公司经理黄恒谱研究，越境到辽西订购。他们既没有通过当地政府的工商行政部门，也没有按照国营公司的牌价收购，这是违犯国家政策的行为。现在我们除给该粮栈负责人以警告处分，并继续清查他和私商的关系外，拟予盟粮食公司经理黄恒谱（贪污分子，在“三反”运动中拒不坦白，已被押在法院）以严厉处分，以教育我驻外其他粮栈工作人员。
