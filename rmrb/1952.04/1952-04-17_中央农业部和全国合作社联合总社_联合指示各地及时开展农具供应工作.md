Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives jointly issued an urgent instruction, requiring agricultural departments and cooperatives at all levels to cooperate closely and promptly carry out agricultural tool work.

The instruction pointed out: Increasing and replenishing agricultural tools is one of the powerful guarantees for increasing yield per unit area. Cooperatives, agricultural tool stations, and agricultural departments in various regions should pay close attention to agricultural tool work to ensure the timely supply of tools to farmers without violating the farming season. Agricultural departments and cooperatives at all levels should strengthen their leadership over agricultural tool work, ensuring that there are dedicated personnel in charge, dedicated funds are used, and agricultural tools are produced and supplied to farmers in a planned and organized manner. The issuance of agricultural tool loans and the promotion of new agricultural tools in various regions should have a focus, which should be determined by the agricultural departments in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Central People's Government, in coordination with the cooperatives, based on the specific local conditions. Agricultural departments and cooperatives in various regions should strengthen their ties with rural areas, investigate and study specific methods for increasing and replenishing agricultural tools, mobilize local blacksmiths and carpenters to organize iron and wood production cooperatives, and mobilize urban blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside to make and repair agricultural tools. When necessary, agricultural departments can provide loan support. Agricultural departments and cooperatives should have dedicated personnel to lead agricultural tool production, so that urban agricultural tool production cooperatives and public-private joint agricultural tool factories can persist in production during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and ensure the completion of agricultural tool production tasks. Agricultural tool stations in various regions should take the initiative to cooperate with cooperatives in various regions to vigorously carry out the promotion of new agricultural tools. In areas where agricultural tool stations have not been established, cooperatives should focus on promoting new agricultural tools to mutual aid groups and guide farmers in the use of new agricultural tools. In addition, various regions should organize repair teams to repair new agricultural tools for farmers.

Agricultural departments and cooperatives in various regions should contact banks, vigorously absorb rural idle funds, and enter into consignment sales, advance purchases, and credit purchases contracts with agricultural tool manufacturers under the principle of urban-rural exchange; focus on mobilizing farmers to raise funds to order goods, or collect scrap iron to exchange for agricultural tools. Agricultural departments and cooperatives should also study specific methods for farmers to exchange local products for agricultural tools with local native produce companies and trade companies to solve the farmers' financial difficulties in purchasing agricultural tools.
