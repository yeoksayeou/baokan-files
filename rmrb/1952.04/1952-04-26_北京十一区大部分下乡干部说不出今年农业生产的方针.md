    Most Township Cadres in Beijing's Eleventh District Cannot Explain This Year's Agricultural Production Guidelines
    Editor: Township cadres in Beijing's Eleventh District are seriously neglecting reading newspapers. Recently, we conducted a review of the township cadres' current affairs and political studies and found that most of them have a very vague understanding of major domestic and international issues, and even lack the necessary understanding of policies and resolutions that are closely related to their work. Some township cadres have not even read the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural production for 1952; some have read it, but still do not understand the basic content of the decision. Therefore, most of them cannot answer what the agricultural production guidelines for this year are. Some people say that the agricultural production guidelines for this year are "expanding the unit area," some only know that it is "organizing from individual to collective," and "planting more wheat." These township cadres do not understand the policies, so naturally they have no clear direction in their work and it is difficult to lead the masses in production effectively.
    The district cadres working in the townships move around in various villages for a long time and their work is very unstable. Some people want to read newspapers, but cannot find them; people who do not usually pay attention to reading newspapers are even less likely to read them in this situation. This objective condition increases the difficulty of township cadres' current affairs studies. However, the more important reason for neglecting current affairs studies is that most township cadres regard reading newspapers as a waste of time and put work and studying newspapers in opposition to each other. They say, "I am so busy with work, how can I have time to read newspapers?" "Whether I read newspapers or not, it has little to do with my work." The relevant leadership has not paid attention to this situation, let alone tried to solve it, so the township district cadres' current affairs and political studies have long been in a state of laissez-faire. This phenomenon is very common, and I hope the relevant leadership will pay attention to solving this problem. Li Qun

### 北京十一区大部分下乡干部说不出今年农业生产的方针

    北京十一区大部分下乡干部说不出今年农业生产的方针
    编辑同志：北京市第十一区的下乡干部，严重地忽视读报。最近，我们对下乡干部的时事和政治学习进行了一次检查，发觉大部分下乡干部对当前的国内外重大问题了解得十分模糊，甚至对和自己工作有密切关系的政策和决议，也缺乏应有的认识。有些下乡干部连中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定也没有看过；有的虽然看过了，但还不了解这个决定的基本内容。因此，他们大都回答不出今年农业生产的方针是什么。有的人说今年农业生产的方针是“扩大单位面积”，有的人只知道是“组织起来由个体走向集体”，是“多种小麦”。这些下乡干部不了解政策，在工作中当然也就没有明确的方向，很难把群众生产领导好。
    下乡工作的区干部，长期在各村流动，工作很不固定。有些人想看报，但是找不到报纸；平时不注意看报的人，在这种情况下就更加不看报了。这种客观条件，增加了下乡干部时事学习的困难。但是，忽视时事学习的更主要的原因，是下乡干部大都把读报看作是耽误时间的事情，把工作和学习报纸对立起来。他们说：“我工作忙得要命，那有时间看报？”“看报不看报，对工作关系不大。”对于这种情况，有关领导方面一直没有注意过，更没有设法去解决，因此，下乡区干部的时事和政治学习长期地陷于自流状态。这种现象是很普遍的，我希望有关领导方面注意解决这个问题。    力群
