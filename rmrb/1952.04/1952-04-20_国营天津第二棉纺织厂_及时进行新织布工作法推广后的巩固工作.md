    State-Run Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory: Timely Consolidation Work After Promoting the New Weaving Method

    The State-Run Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has been promptly carrying out consolidation work following the promotion of the "1951 Weaving Method."

    Since the National Weaving Method Conference in November of last year, the factory organized a promotion team, adhering to the spirit of combining promotion and improvement. They first promoted the method in the first weaving workshop. By late January, the promotion was basically complete across the board. Judging from the measured scores, the overall average score was above 85 points, and the active shuttle change rate reached about 90%. Some people increased their loom-watching capacity from six to eight (ordinary looms). However, because workers were not skilled enough when they first learned the technique, neither output nor quality improved in January. In this situation, some workers doubted the superiority of the new method. Some workers complained that the cadres and "little teachers" responsible for the promotion did not teach them well. Others simply emphasized that the yarn and warp beams were not good, and that the maintenance workers did not cooperate well, etc.

    The "1951 Weaving Method" Promotion Committee of this factory, in response to the above situation, convened a meeting of cadres responsible for the promotion work for specialized research. The leadership affirmed the superiority of the new method, believing that the basic problem lay in strengthening the consolidation work after the promotion, and made effective measures for this. First, a workshop consolidation committee was formed with a dozen or so "little teachers" who were active and responsible in the promotion work in the workshop, as well as workshop administrative and trade union cadres. Then, a measurement group and an adjustment and remedial teaching group were established. The measurement group was responsible for measuring the workers' operation of the "1951 Weaving Method" and providing guidance and correction at any time. The adjustment and remedial teaching group provided supplementary teaching to workers who had not yet learned it. In addition, reporting, consultation, and meeting systems were established. Each shift had to report every day, and there was a consultation meeting every day, attended by "little teachers," the chairman of the trade union, and the administrative manager, to study the problem of consolidating the new method. The consolidation committee met once a week on Thursdays to discuss the work plan for the following week. A discussion meeting was held every Saturday. The "little teachers" also had a clear division of labor, divided by the four districts and three shifts of the workshop, to take charge of inspection and supervision.

    In order to further consolidate the achievements of learning the "1951 Weaving Method," the workshop also launched a "Full Red" competition with mutual aid groups as the basic competition units. Individuals with excellent performance in operating the "1951 Weaving Method" were awarded red flags, districts with excellent performance were awarded large red flags, and entire shifts with excellent performance were awarded a "Full Red" title, a large brocade banner, and the top ten workers in the entire workshop competition were awarded red flowers and praised on the honor roll. Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm for promoting the "1951 Weaving Method" was very high.

    After the consolidation of the promotion work of the new weaving method, there was a significant improvement in production. The average output in February was 35.32 yards, and the first-class cloth rate was 97.32%, exceeding the original plan. Weaving worker Liu Qingzeng increased his loom watching from four to eight.

    国营天津第二棉纺织厂
    及时进行新织布工作法推广后的巩固工作
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂，及时进行“一九五一织布工作法”推广后的巩固工作。
    自去年十一月全国织布工作法会议后，这个厂便组织了推广组，本着推广和提高相结合的精神，首先在第一布场推广。到一月下旬，基本上全面推广了。从测定分数来看，总平均分数在八十五分以上，主动换梭率达到百分之九十左右，有些人把看台能力由六台提高到八台（普通布机）。但因为工人在初学会时技术不够熟练，一月份产量、质量都没有提高。在这种情况下，有些工人对新工作法的优越性发生怀疑；有些工人怨负责推广的干部和“小先生”没有很好地教他们；有的更单纯强调纱和经轴不好、保全工人没有很好配合等。
    这个厂的“一九五一织布工作法”推广委员会，针对上述情况，召开了负责推广工作的干部会议，专门进行了研究。领导方面肯定了新工作法的优越性，认为基本问题在于加强推广后的巩固工作，并对这作了有效的措施。首先以车间推广工作中积极负责的“小先生”和车间行政、工会干部十几个人组成车间巩固委员会，并成立测定组、调整补教组。测定组负责测定职工操作“一九五一织布工作法”的情况，随时加以指导纠正。调整补教组补教没有学习过的职工。此外，并建立了汇报、碰头、会议等制度。每天各班都要汇报，每天有碰头会，由“小先生”、工会主席、行政管理员参加，研究巩固新工作法问题。每星期四开巩固委员会会议一次，讨论下周的工作计划。每星期六开讨论会。“小先生”也有了明确的分工，按车间四个区三班，分工掌握检查督导工作。
    为进一步巩固学习“一九五一织布工作法”的成绩，车间又开展了以互助小组为基层竞赛单位的
    “满堂红”竞赛。个人操作“一九五一织布工作法”成绩优良的挂红旗，全区成绩优良的挂大红旗，全班成绩优良即为“满堂红”，奖给大锦旗一面，并给全车间竞赛中头十名工人戴红花，在光荣榜上表扬。因此，工人推行“一九五一织布工作法”的情绪十分高涨。
    新织布工作法的推广工作巩固了以后，生产有了显著的改进。二月份平均产量为三十五点三二码，正布率为百分之九十七点三二，超过了原计划。织布工刘庆曾，由看四台车提高到看八台车。
