    Interview with Park Hyo-bin, Head of the Delegation of the Korean Trade Union
    Mr. Park Hyo-bin, head of the Korean Trade Union Delegation, who was invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, met with reporters who interviewed him three hours after arriving in Beijing. Park Hyo-bin first talked about his feelings about coming to China to participate in the May Day celebrations. He said: "As soon as we entered the Chinese border, we deeply realized the feelings and strength of the Chinese people in supporting us!" Park Hyo-bin said in an emotional tone: "On the way to Beijing, we passed through countless towns and villages, and wherever we went, we could see eye-catching slogans or propaganda paintings of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At the same time, we know that the news of the victorious advancement of the great 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements is also coming from all corners. Mass labor competitions are in full swing. All this is a very powerful encouragement to the Korean people who are fighting hard. When we see the Chinese people who love their country and are rich in internationalism, exerting their great power, victoriously building their own country and vigorously supporting us, our confidence in resisting the U.S. imperialist aggression, defending the motherland, and defending world peace is even more enhanced."
    He said: "Each of us in the delegation has this feeling: the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people is condensed with blood. In the past, during the Anti-Japanese War, we fought bravely shoulder to shoulder; now, in order to combat the U.S. imperialism that undermines peace, we are fighting side by side again. After coming to China—although the time is so short—we feel even more the value of the unbreakable friendship between the people of Korea and China. We firmly believe that to achieve victory and defend peace, we must be with the Chinese people!"
    When asked about the heroic deeds of the Korean working class in the war against U.S. imperialist aggression, Park Hyo-bin said: "They are all standing at the forefront of the struggle." He said: "Since U.S. imperialism instigated the puppet Syngman Rhee to launch an attack north of the 38th parallel, some Korean workers have put down their hammers, picked up their rifles, and gone to the front line, becoming fighters who directly strike the enemy. Those who stayed behind to work made a guarantee to General Kim Il-sung: 'Everything for the victory of the war!' Under the constant harassment of enemy planes, they persisted in their hard work day and night with their love for the motherland. After the U.S. imperialist army directly participated in the war, they once invaded northern Korea. Under their barbarous destruction, many factories were destroyed. But since the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea and launched a counter-offensive with the Korean People's Army, driving the enemy back south of the 38th parallel, our factories have returned to our own hands. The Korean workers, with a high spirit of patriotism, took on the work of restoring the factories. This can be a comfort to our Chinese brothers and all countries and people who care about us, our factories have basically all been restored."
    Speaking of this, Park Hyo-bin talked about the two worker representatives who came to China this time. He said: "In the process of rebuilding a factory from a pile of rubble into a factory conducting patriotic large-scale production, countless heroic models have emerged. Every industrial worker has made a plan for increasing production and practicing economy; then, with unparalleled enthusiasm, they have used their brains to improve production methods, overfulfill production tasks, and create new production records. Jin Yuanri and Zhu Baoyu, who came to China this time, are two of them." Park Hyo-bin also talked about Zhao Doushi, a national labor hero of Korea. He is a coal miner who used to dig ten tons of coal a day, but now he has created a record of 154 tons a day.
    Finally, Park Hyo-bin talked about the support of the democratic countries and peace-loving people all over the world for the Korean people. He said: "The spiritual and material assistance from the people of the world has greatly enhanced our confidence in battle. Every Korean people knows that our struggle is not isolated, and everyone believes that the final victory belongs to the Korean people and the people of the world."
    Park Hyo-bin's speech was full of enthusiasm. His speech ended with the slogan:
    "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and laboring people!" (Xiao Feng) (Attached picture)

    访朝鲜工会代表团团长朴孝斌
    应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的朝鲜工会代表团到达北京三小时后，朴孝斌团长马上接见了访问他的记者。朴孝斌首先谈起他来中国参加五一节观礼的感想。他说：“我们一走进中国的国境，就更深刻地体会到了中国人民支援我们的感情和力量！”朴孝斌团长用充满感情的声调说：“在到北京来的途中，我们经过了无数的城镇和乡村，走到那里，都能够看见引人注目的抗美援朝的标语或宣传画。同时，我们知道，伟大的‘三反’‘五反’运动的胜利推进的消息也从各个角落传来。群众性的劳动竞赛正在火热地进行。这一切，对于正在艰苦战斗的朝鲜人民来说，是一个非常有力的鼓舞。当我们看见热爱祖国、又富于国际主义精神的中国人民，发挥他们的巨大力量，一面胜利地建设自己的国家，一面大力地支援我们的时候，我们的反抗美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平的信心，就更加增强了。”
    他说：“我们代表团每一个人都有这样的感想：朝中人民的友谊是用鲜血凝成的。过去，在抗日时期，我们曾肩并肩地英勇作战；现在，为了打击破坏和平的美帝国主义，我们又在一起并肩作战了。来到中国以后——虽然时间是这么短——我们更感觉到朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊的价值。我们坚信要取得胜利，保卫和平，就必须和中国人民在一道！”
    记者问到朝鲜工人阶级在反抗美帝国主义侵略战争中的英勇事迹，朴孝斌团长说：“他们都是站在斗争的最前线的。”他说：“自从美帝国主义唆使傀儡李承晚向三八线以北发动进攻以后，一部分朝鲜工人就放下鎯头，扛起步枪，走上火线，变成直接打击敌人的战士。那些留在后方工作的，都向金日成将军提出了‘一切为了战争的胜利！’的保证。在敌机不断地骚扰下，他们凭着热爱祖国的心，日日夜夜地坚持着艰苦的工作。美帝国主义的军队直接参战以后，曾经一度侵入朝鲜的北部，在他们野蛮的破坏下，许多工厂被摧毁了。但是自从英勇的中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军一块展开反攻，一直把敌人赶回三八线以南以后，我们的工厂又回到我们自己的手里。朝鲜工人以高度爱国主义的精神，担当起恢复工厂的工作。这是可以告慰于中国兄弟和所有关心我们的国家和人民的，我们的工厂已经基本上全部恢复了。”
    说到这里，朴孝斌团长谈起这次来中国的两位工人代表。他说：“在我们把一片瓦砾重建成进行爱国主义大生产的工厂的过程中，无数的英雄模范涌现了出来。每一个产业工人都订了增产节约的计划；然后以无比的热情，开动脑筋，改进生产方法，超计划地完成生产任务，创造出新的生产纪录。这次来中国的金元曰和朱宝玉同志就是他们当中的两个。”朴孝斌团长又谈到了朝鲜全国劳动英雄赵斗实，他是一个煤矿工人，他过去每日挖十吨煤，现在他创造了每日一百五十四吨的纪录。
    朴孝斌团长最后谈到全世界各民主国家及爱好和平的人民对朝鲜人民的支援。他说：“来自全世界人民的精神的、物质的援助，大大提高了我们的战斗信心。每一个朝鲜人民都知道我们的战斗不是孤立的，人人都相信最后的胜利是属于朝鲜人民和全世界人民的。”
    朴孝斌团长的谈话，热情横溢。他的谈话，是以
    “中国工人阶级和劳动人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！”的口号结束的。（萧凤）（附图片）
