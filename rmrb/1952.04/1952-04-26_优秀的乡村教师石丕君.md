    Excellent Rural Teacher Shi Pijun
    Elementary Education Section, Songjiang Provincial Department of Education

    Qinglan Village is a mountain village in Baoqing County, Songjiang Province. No one had ever mentioned establishing a school here. In the spring of 1948, as the economic lives of the farmers improved, they also urgently wanted to learn culture and establish a school for their children, but they suffered from a lack of teachers. At that time, although there were several people in the village who had studied for six or seven years, the masses were unwilling to let them educate their children because of their backward thinking. Finally, after the election by the village people's congress, this glorious and important responsibility fell on Shi Pijun.

    Shi Pijun was born into a peasant family, herded cattle for landlords, and worked as a coolie under the rule of the Japanese devils.

    In 1946, the Communist Party came, and Shi Pijun, along with the people of Baoqing County, was liberated. From the beginning of the liquidation struggle, he took the lead in participating in the farmers' association. With the continuous education of the civil affairs work team, his political awareness was improved, and he became one of the most active members of the village.

    When the masses unanimously supported him to serve as a village primary school teacher, he felt uneasy and dared not accept the task, because he knew that his education level was low (less than two and a half years of schooling) and he was afraid of not being able to teach well. Comrade Li of the work team encouraged him, saying, "There is no work that cannot be done; it all depends on whether you are willing to do it. If you are willing, you can do it." With the help of the comrades of the work team and the encouragement of the masses, he agreed.

    In 1948, the lives of the people who had turned over were still very difficult. When the school was established, there were only three dilapidated thatched houses. But Shi Pijun realized the temporary difficulties of the people's lives and took the initiative to propose not taking a salary. In the construction of the school, in order to reduce the burden on the masses, he never troubled the masses with anything that he could figure out himself or do himself, such as removing the kang (platform bed), plastering walls, and building partitions; he personally led the students to do it. When there were no desks, he found some boards and nailed four legs to them to make desks; when there was nothing for office use, he took it from his own home. As a result, some people said, "You are really not making any sense being a teacher, you are not earning anything but instead losing your own money!" But he did not take it seriously and replied, "I think the difficulties of us poor people are my difficulties. The Communist Party is leading us, and the future is bright. We won't always be this poor in the future!"

    The school was established, and the students were about to start learning. But there were no books, so what were they going to study? He borrowed a language textbook from a complete primary school in the city and copied a lesson to teach a lesson. There were a total of thirty-eight students, and he had to copy thirty-eight copies for each lesson. Once he had the books, he started the first lesson. But how was he going to teach? He didn't know arithmetic, and he could recognize and write the words in the language textbook, but he couldn't explain them. In the end, he had no choice but to not teach arithmetic, and only taught literacy in the language class, requiring students to be able to read and write. At this time, Shi Pijun was truly facing difficulties everywhere, and he did not know how many setbacks and blows he suffered. Teachers in other villages thought he didn't look like a teacher; landlords and loafers secretly said, "Who doesn't know how much he knows? How can he teach!" However, this did not shake Shi Pijun's will. He said, "When I recall the suffering of the past and see the happy life of today, I immediately feel strength."

    In addition to studying hard in his spare time, from 1948 to 1950, he participated in seven teacher winter and summer vacation studies, without being absent for a single day. Each study gave Shi Pijun a great deal of help in terms of politics, business, and culture. For example, in the 1948 summer vacation study, he scored zero on the first arithmetic test, but scored forty at the end of the study.

    Shi Pijun not only paid attention to cultural and professional studies, but also paid special attention to political and current affairs studies. Reading newspapers has become his habit. Every time he receives a newspaper, he carefully reads and studies it. What should be publicized to the masses is handed over to the propagandists, reading groups, or written on the blackboard newspaper. This not only improved his own political level, but also improved the awareness of the masses.

    In the second semester of 1948, arithmetic was added to the school, and teaching was carried out according to the prescribed curriculum. The number of students increased from thirty-eight to sixty-two. Since its establishment, the school has cultivated a total of sixteen students with the level of elementary school graduation, eleven of whom have been admitted to complete primary school, and one has joined the military cadre school.

    Shi Pijun pays close attention to studying the cultural policies and policies of the People's Government and the instructions of the higher authorities, and is good at carrying out work according to the specific situation. He actively responded to the call for health education work. He believes that in order to make students healthy, in addition to carrying out physical activities, it is also necessary to improve the school's environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, and improve teaching methods and reduce the burden on students. There were many difficulties in carrying out sports activities, but he did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. For example, the school classrooms were small and the sunlight was not sufficient, so after discussing solutions with the village cadres, he used his spare time to lead the students to renovate the partitions and expand the classrooms. Without sports equipment, he visited complete primary schools, drew out what he could make, and called on students to collect materials to help make it themselves with the help of village cadres and parents. Without ropes, they made their own; without nets, they wove their own; they made their own iron rings and iron hooks. Now, the schoolyard is full of self-made swings, horizontal bars, and ping-pong tables, as well as a tennis court. He said: "In addition to teaching, I also work as three craftsmen: mason, carpenter and blacksmith." After overcoming the difficulties of insufficient sports equipment, he created game methods. Now students generally practice health exercises and have learned six or seven kinds of dances and group game methods. Fights, scolding, and other phenomena no longer occur.

    Shi Pijun's work is characterized by being good at connecting with reality. He often conducts patriotic ideological education for students. For a period of time, he learned that some students had a low opinion of farmers. After research, he knew that the reason for this idea was that their parents often said to their children: "Study hard! If you study well, you don't have to be a farmer." According to this situation, he often used examples from the students' lives to illustrate that only labor can create the world, and only with labor can we have clothes to wear and food to eat. He also introduced the deeds of labor heroes and combat heroes to the students, and pointed out that the reason why the volunteers were able to kill the enemy so bravely was because they were the children of the working people and defended the fruits of the people's labor. In this way, students gradually realized the greatness of the working people and eliminated the students' contempt for the working people. Because Shi Pijun is very good at conducting ideological education by linking theory with practice in classroom teaching and various activities, during the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, one student joined the military cadre school, and four students mobilized two young people in the village to register for the army in the county.

    He pays great attention to the practice of students. He often said: "The requirements for students should not be too high, and requirements must be made according to students' abilities; if students' abilities are overestimated and excessive demands are made on them, it will be difficult to mobilize them again if they fail to do so once." He sometimes found that students were reluctant to go home after school. After understanding, he knew that they were afraid of going home to work after school. After further research, he found that the general parents did not have the correct purpose for the students' labor requirements, and the labor was too heavy; as a result, students talked about the glory of labor in words, but in their minds they hated and despised labor. According to this situation, he held a parents' symposium to explain this issue and open up the minds of parents. He also obtained the consent of the parents to form students into groups according to their residence, responsible for household chores such as chopping grass and fetching water, so the students were very willing to do it and were no longer afraid of going home to work after school.

    Another characteristic of Shi Pijun's work is his willingness to study problems and be creative. In the spring of 1951, he saw the slide projector that the county had just bought from the province, and felt that this thing was a good tool for propaganda for farmers and students, and he was very envious; but he couldn't afford it, so he made up his mind to create one. In order to create a slide projector, he studied in the cultural center for a whole day, and the most difficult thing was the lack of materials. When he returned to school, he mobilized students to collect convex lenses and materials for making slide projectors. When the materials were collected, he began to make them. After they were made, he tested them. If they didn't work, he pondered and remade them. After four or five tests, he finally succeeded. When the first set of slide films was shown at Qinglan Village Primary School, it was warmly welcomed by students and the masses. The production of slide projectors has been of great help to teaching and propaganda work for farmers.

    Shi Pijun is very concerned about production and literacy movement. He often said: "Only by doing a good job in production can we have conditions for all work." Therefore, as soon as the spring ploughing began, he publicized to the masses the importance of growing more commercial grain and using copper sulfate fertilizer. This spring, when organizing production, he took the initiative to help village cadres formulate production plans. Based on the experience that the village mutual aid group was not established last year, he suggested that cadres should divide their labor and concentrate their efforts to do a good job in two "points" to promote the production of the whole village and correct the bias of the district cadres last year who established production groups but the village cadres did not actively lead, resulting in the collapse of the production groups. He took the initiative to work with the armed committee member and the village chief to form a Shi Shuchun group to promote experience. He often used his spare time to go deep into the group to help formulate production plans, patriotic pacts, and introduce production experience from the newspaper. In accordance with the government's call, he carried out propaganda aimed at the concerns of the masses in production. For example, the government called for "more fertilizer and more grain," and the masses felt that "the land is strong, and fertilization is a waste. It is better to open up more wasteland than to fertilize." Shi Pijun discussed solutions with the village cadres and organized old farmers to introduce experience. At the same time, the Shi Shuchun group was the focus, and topdressing was completed first, which promoted the whole village. Because Shi Pijun carried out such production propaganda and mobilization education and assisted village cadres in participating in production groups for guidance, the Shi Shuchun group became a typical group in the village, promoting the work of the whole village and making it an advanced production village in the entire district.

    He pays great attention to publicity work. He not only carries out publicity in his own village, but also uses his spare time and holidays to carry out publicity in Xinglonggou, Haojiacun, Gaojiayuanzi and other places. The slides he showed were also warmly welcomed by the masses in nearby villages. Whenever the masses had unclear problems, he always tried to solve them and carry out persuasive education. In order to improve the old midwifery method in rural areas, the government mobilized several women to go to the county to study, but the masses were unwilling to go. Shi Pijun told the masses about the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old midwifery methods, and collected relevant materials to make slide films for publicity, which resulted in the mobilization of four women to go to the county to study.

    Shi Pijun has also achieved great success in the cultural education of the general masses. When the winter school was first established in 1948, the masses did not have enough understanding, the cadres did not actively participate, and the loafers disrupted the situation, saying strange things, and the study could not be carried out. In June 1949, the higher authorities called for the organization of literacy groups. Shi Pijun first established literacy groups of three or four people among the active members of the village, which later expanded to seven people. Shi Pijun taught two to three characters every night, and persisted until the winter school began. In the spring of 1950, when the winter school was transformed into a literacy class, the masses had no confidence. Shi Pijun organized a men's group and a women's group, and used these two groups as the backbone to promote the study of the whole village. Now 62 people in the village participate in year-round study. In 1950, a total of 43 people participated in winter school study. After the winter school ended, the least literate could recognize 100 characters, and the most could recognize 600 or 700 characters. Shi Pijun said: "In the past, people in this village had to look for me to calculate accounts and read notes. Now they can read notes and calculate accounts themselves!"

    Because he cares so much about the masses, the masses also care about him. The village cadres said: "The school and the government are the same thing." The government and the school discuss things together when there is something to do, and when the school has difficulties, the government and the masses try to find ways to solve them. When there were no curtains for performing plays and showing slides, the masses took the initiative to make two white curtains with black borders for the school.

    In recent years, because Shi Pijun is loyal to the people's education cause, he has never forgotten the happy life brought about by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the liberation. He has always been active and worked hard, and has created outstanding achievements. Therefore, in the first Songjiang Provincial Primary School Excellent Teacher Award Conference, he was selected as a special-class excellent teacher. His deeds and experience inspired and educated the 300 teachers attending the meeting, and everyone expressed their willingness to learn from Shi Pijun. However, he was not complacent about his achievements. When he summarized his achievements, he said: "I was originally a poor peasant. If the Communist Party hadn't saved me, I would still be oppressed. How could I be engaged in cultural construction for the motherland? After liberation, if the Communist Party and the higher authorities had not led me, educated me, and comrades helped me, I would not have achieved today's achievements. My glory is the glory of the Party and the People's Government. In the future, I will learn from everyone and strive to contribute to the motherland's cultural construction cause to the end. I will definitely strive to join the Party and serve the motherland and the people better under the leadership of the Party."

    优秀的乡村教师石丕君
    松江省文教厅初等教育科
    庆兰村是松江省宝清县的一个山村。在这里，从来没有人提过设立学校。一九四八年春，农民们随着经济生活的提高，也迫切地想学习文化，要给自己的子弟成立学校，但苦于没有教师。当时村内虽有几位念过六、七年书的人，可是，由于他们的思想落后，群众都不愿意让他们来教育自己的子弟。最后，经村人民代表会的推选，这一光荣而重要的职责就落到石丕君身上了。
    石丕君是农民出身，给地主放过牛，在日本鬼子统治下当过苦力。
    一九四六年来了共产党，石丕君才和宝清县人民一同得到了解放。清算斗争一开始，他就带头参加了农会，在民运工作团不断地教育下，他的政治觉悟提高了，成为村内有数的积极分子。
    当群众一致拥护他担任村的小学教师时，他感到很不安，不敢接受这个任务。因为他知道自己的文化程度低（念了不到二年半的书），唯恐教不好。工作团李同志鼓励他说：“没有干不了的工作，就看肯不肯干，肯干就行。”经过工作团同志的帮助，群众的鼓励，他答应了。
    一九四八年，翻身后的群众生活仍很困难，学校成立时只有三间破旧的草房。但石丕君体会到人民生活的暂时困难，就主动地提出不要工薪。在建设学校中，他为了减轻群众的负担，凡是能够自己想办法或自己能作的，如扒炕、抹墙、打间壁等活，从不麻烦群众，都是亲自动手领着学生干。没有书桌子就找来些板子，钉上四条腿当桌子；没有办公用的东西就从自己家里拿。因之就有人说：“你这个教员当的真没有意思，挣不着啥倒把自己赔上了！”但他却不以为然地回答：“我认为咱们穷人的困难，就是我的困难。共产党领导着咱们，前途是远大的，将来不能总是这样困难呀！”
    学校建立起来了，学生要开始学习了。但是没有书，念什么呢？他便从城内的完小那儿借来一本国语，抄一课教一课。一共三十八名学生，教一课就得抄三十八份。有了书，就开始上第一堂了。可是怎么讲呢？算术不会，国语课本上的字能认、能写，却不能讲。最后只好不教算术，国语只教认字，要求学生会念会写就行。这时石丕君真是到处是难，不知碰了多少钉子，受了多少打击。别村的教员认为他没有先生的样儿；地主、二流子在暗地里说：“谁还不知道他那两下子，他还能教学！”但是，这并没有动摇石丕君的意志。他说：“当我回想到过去的痛苦，又见到了今天的幸福生活的时候，我就立时有了力量。”
    除了平时刻苦学习外，从一九四八年到一九五零年，他共参加了七次教师寒暑假学习，都是一天不缺席。每次学习都给石丕君在政治上、业务上、文化上以很大的帮助。比如在一九四八年暑假学习中，第一次算术测验是零分，但学习结束时则得了四十分。
    石丕君不只是注意文化业务学习，对政治和时事学习也特别关心。阅读报纸已成为他的习惯。每次收到报纸，他都精心地阅读和研究。应该向群众进行宣传的，就交给宣传员、读报组、或者写在黑板报上。这样不只提高了自己的政治水平，同时也提高了群众的觉悟。
    一九四八年下学期学校添上了算术，按规定课程进行教学，学生由三十八名增加到六十二名。学校从开办到现在，共培养了十六名初小毕业程度的学生，有十一名已考入了完小，还有一名参加了军事干部学校。
    石丕君很注意研究人民政府的文化方针、政策和上级的指示，并善于根据具体情况进行工作。他积极响应了健康教育工作的号召。他认为要使学生的身体健康，除了开展体育活动，还必须改善学校环境卫生、个人卫生状况，并应改进教学方法和减轻学生的负担。在开展体育活动等方面的困难本是很多的，但他没有在困难面前低头，例如：学校教室狭小，阳光不充足，他就在和村干部研究了办法以后，利用课余时间领着学生重新修整了间壁，扩充了教室。没有运动器具，他就到完小参观，把自己能作的画出样子，回校号召学生搜集材料，在村干部和家长的帮助下，自己动手制作。没有绳子自己制；没有球网子自己织，铁圈、铁钩自己打。到现在，校内的院里布满了自己制作的秋千、单杠、乒乓球案子，另外还有了网球场。他说：“我除了教学以外，还兼三匠：泥匠、木匠和铁匠。”他克服了体育设备不足的困难后，又创造了游戏方法。现在学生普遍练习着保健体操，并学会了六七种舞蹈和集体游戏方法。打架、骂人等现象不再发生了。
    石丕君的工作特点是善于联系实际。他经常向学生进行爱国主义的思想教育。有一段时间，他了解到学生中有看不起农民的思想，经过研究，知道造成这种思想的原因是他们的父母经常向孩子们说：“好好念吧！念好了书可以不当庄稼人。”根据这个情况，他就经常从学生的生活中举例说明：只有劳动才能创造世界，有了劳动才有衣穿、才有饭吃。并给学生介绍劳动英雄、战斗英雄的事迹，同时指出志愿军所以能这样勇敢杀敌，就是因为他们是劳动人民的子女，为了保卫人民的劳动果实。这样就逐渐使学生体会到劳动人民的伟大，消除了学生看不起劳动人民的思想。由于石丕君很善于在课堂教学和各种活动中联系实际进行思想教育，在抗美援朝运动中，曾有一名学生参加了军事干部学校，有四名学生动员了二名村内青年到县里报名参军。
    他很注意学生的实践。他经常说：“对学生的要求不能太高，一定要根据学生的能力提出要求；如果对学生的能力估计过高，向他们提出过高的要求，一次做不到，下次再动员就困难了。”他有时发现学生放学后不愿意回家，经过了解，知道他们怕放学后回家干活。经过进一步的研究，他发现一般的家长对学生的劳动要求没有正确的目的，而且劳动太重；结果造成学生在口头上讲劳动光荣，在思想上是厌恶和轻视劳动的。他根据这一情况，就召开家长座谈会，说明了这一问题，打通了家长的思想。他并征得家长的同意，把学生按住所组成小组，负责家庭的铡草、挑水等零活，这样学生很愿意干，再也不怕放学回家劳动了。
    石丕君工作的另一特点，是肯钻研问题和富有创造性。一九五一年春天，他看到县里新从省里买回来的幻灯，觉得这个东西是向农民和学生进行宣传的良好工具，羡慕得很；但买不起，所以下定决心要创造一个。为了创造幻灯，他整整在文化馆研究了一天，最感困难的是没有材料。回校就发动学生搜集凸透镜和制造幻灯的材料。材料搜集来了，就开始制作，作成以后就把它试验一下，不好使，又琢磨着重新作，前后经过四、五次的试验，终于成功了。当第一套幻灯影片在庆兰村小学校放映时，受到了学生和群众的热烈欢迎。幻灯的制成对教学、对农民的宣传工作都有很大的帮助。
    石丕君对于生产和识字运动是非常关心的。他时常说：“只有把生产搞好，一切工作才有条件。”因而春耕一开始，他就向群众宣传多种商品粮和使用王铜施肥等。今春组织生产，他就主动帮助村干部制订生产计划，并根据去年村互助组没有建立起来的经验，建议干部应分工集中力量搞好两个“点”，以推动全村的生产，纠正去年区干部把生产组建立起来，村干部不积极领导，结果使生产组垮台的偏向。并主动和武装委员、村长搞一个史树春小组，以推广经验。他经常利用空隙时间，深入小组帮助订立生产计划、爱国公约，介绍报上的生产经验。并根据政府的号召，针对群众在生产方面的顾虑，进行宣传。比如，政府号召“多施肥、多打粮”，群众觉得“地有劲，上粪白费，有上粪的时间不如多开点荒”。石丕君就和村干部研究办法，组织老农介绍经验。同时以史树春小组为重点，首先完成了追肥，结果推动了全屯。由于石丕君这样进行生产宣传和鼓动教育，协助村干部参加生产小组进行指导，因而使史树春小组成为全村的典型小组，推动了全屯的工作，使它成为全区先进的生产屯子。
    他很注意宣传工作，他不只是在本屯进行宣传，他还利用课余和假日到兴隆沟、郝家村，高家园子等地进行宣传，他放演的幻灯，也受到附近各村群众的热烈欢迎。凡群众有不明白的问题，他总是设法给他们解决和进行说服教育。政府为了改进农村的旧接生法，动员几个妇女到县里去学习，群众都不愿去，石丕君就向群众讲新旧接生法的利弊，并搜集有关材料，制成幻灯片进行宣传，结果动员了四名妇女去县里学习。
    在一般群众的文化教育方面，石丕君也是做得很有成绩的。在一九四八年刚成立冬学时，群众认识不够，干部不积极参加，二流子捣乱，说怪话，学习搞不起来。一九四九年六月，上级号召组织识字组，石丕君首先在村里的积极分子中建立了三、四个人的识字组，后来扩大到七个人。由石丕君每天晚上教二个字到三个字，一直坚持到冬学开始时。一九五零年春，冬学转入识字班的时候，群众都没有信心，石丕君就组织了一个男子组和一个妇女组，以这两组为骨干，推动了全村的学习。现在全村参加常年学习的有六十二人。一九五零年参加冬学学习的共有四十三名，冬学结束后，最少的认一百字，最多的认六、七百字。石丕君说：“过去这村算账看条子都得找我，现在他们都能自己看条子算账了！”
    因为他是这样地关心群众，所以群众也很关心他。村干部说：“学校和政府就是一回事。”政府、学校有事就在一起商量，学校有困难，政府和群众都想办法解决。演剧、演幻灯没有幕布，群众就主动地给学校作了两块镶黑边的白幕。
    几年来，由于石丕君忠实于人民的教育事业，一时一刻忘不了共产党和毛主席领导翻身所得到的幸福生活，工作一贯地积极，埋头苦干，曾创造出卓越的成绩，所以在这次松江省首届小学优秀教师奖励大会上被选为特等优秀教师。他的事迹和经验，鼓舞和教育了到会的三百名教师，大家纷纷表示要向石丕君学习。但他对自己的成就毫不自满，当他总结自己的成绩时说：“我本来是个穷苦的庄稼汉，要不是共产党救了我，还得受压迫，那能为祖国从事文化建设事业呢？解放后，要不是共产党和上级领导我，教育我，同志们帮助我，也不能获得今天的成绩。我的光荣就是党和人民政府的光荣，今后我还要向大家学习，为祖国的文化建设事业奋斗到底，我一定争取入党，在党的领导下更好地为祖国、为人民服务。”
