    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: TASS, Tokyo, April 17th: Japanese authorities are preparing to adopt new persecution measures against Chinese and Korean residents in Japan who have democratic ideas. At the end of March, a bill on deporting Korean and Chinese residents was submitted to the Diet.
    Japanese Communist Party member, Lin Bairang, said at the House of Representatives meeting on March 29th: Six hundred thousand Chinese and Koreans residing in Japan have raised their national consciousness, and this is an obstacle to the plan of US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to turn Japan into a bridgehead for aggression in Asia.
    Lin Bairang pointed out: This bill stipulates that Chinese and Korean citizens residing in Japan must be forced to register. He said: It is clear that anyone who supports the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be treated as "lawbreakers" and deported; and those who register as citizens of South Korea or subjects of the Kuomintang "government" will be conscripted into the army and used as cannon fodder for the United States.
    Lin Bairang emphasized that this bill stipulates the deportation of poor Chinese and Korean residents, saying: The economic discrimination policy pursued by the Japanese authorities is the reason for the poverty of Korean and Chinese residents. Lin Bairang warned that the people of Asian countries, especially the people of China and Korea, will not fail to punish the Japanese reactionaries – Yoshida and his accomplices – for such cruel actions.

    吉田反动政府使用无耻手段
    加紧迫害我国与朝鲜侨民
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社东京十七日讯：日本当局正准备对于在日本的有民主思想的中国侨民和朝鲜侨民采取新的迫害手段。三月底曾有一个关于驱逐朝鲜侨民和中国侨民出境的议案提交国会。
    日本共产党议员林百郎在三月二十九日的众议院会议上说：六十万提高了民族觉悟的中国人和朝鲜人居住在日本，这对于美帝国主义和日本反动派变日本为侵略亚洲的桥头堡的计划说来，是一个障碍。
    林百郎指出：这项议案规定强迫侨居日本的中国公民和朝鲜公民进行登记，他说：很明显，凡是拥护中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人都要被当作“违法者”而驱逐出境；而那些作为南朝鲜的公民或国民党“政府”的老百姓而登记的人，则将被征去参加军队，充当美国的炮灰。
    林百郎指出这个议案规定要把穷苦的中国侨民和朝鲜侨民驱逐出境时强调说：日本当局所奉行的经济歧视政策，正是造成朝鲜侨民和中国侨民赤贫的原因。林百郎警告说：亚洲各国人民，特别是中国和朝鲜人民，对于日本反动派——吉田及其伙帮——的这种残酷的行动是不会不加以惩罚的。
