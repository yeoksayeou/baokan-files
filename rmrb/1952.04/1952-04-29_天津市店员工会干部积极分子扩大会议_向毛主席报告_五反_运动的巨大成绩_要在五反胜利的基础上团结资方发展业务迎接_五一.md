The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union held an enlarged meeting of cadres and activists on the 23rd. The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting the achievements of shop employees throughout the city in the Five-Anti Movement, and expressed their intention to hold labor-capital consultation meetings on the basis of the victory of the Five-Anti Movement, to improve labor-capital relations on the basis of the Common Program, to unite with capitalists to rapidly restore and develop business, to supervise operations, and to prevent capitalists from engaging in the "five evils" again, in order to prepare for the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to welcome "May Day." The content of the letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership, the 70,000 shop employees in Tianjin have achieved a brilliant victory in the struggle of the Five-Anti Movement. 95% of the city's shop employees actively participated in the Five-Anti Movement, and more than 9,000 shop employees directly participated in the "Tiger Hunting Teams" and inspection groups; in the movement, 6,598 new activists emerged; efforts were made to unite 2,952 senior staff members to participate in the Five-Anti battle; at the same time, more than 5,000 shop employees joined the trade union, further strengthening the trade union organization. From January 6th to the present, according to incomplete statistics, shop employees throughout the city have reported more than 84,000 cases of illegal activities by unlawful capitalists, breaking through 332 offensive and defensive alliances; uncovered 8,662 secret account books; and identified 1,028 unlawful capitalists with illegal income of over 100 million yuan, including 45 with 5 billion to 20 billion yuan, and 3 with over 20 billion yuan.

In addition, in order to consolidate and expand the victory of the Five-Anti Movement, we have also begun to achieve victories in uniting capitalists to rapidly restore and develop business. The turnover of many stores has increased month by month. For example, the turnover of Shunji (Changji) Grocery Store in March was double that of the best month in the past three years, and in April, as of the 22nd, it has exceeded the turnover of March. With our unity and active assistance, the capitalists have also been moved. In the capitalist study class jointly organized by the Tianjin Shop Employees' Union and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce alone, capitalists from 64 stores increased investment and expanded operations. For example, Shunji (Changji) Grocery Store initially invested 500 million yuan, then invested 240 taels of gold, and then invested another 120 taels of gold. Now more than 100 units have established labor-capital consultation meetings.

We, the 70,000 shop employees of the city, are filled with victorious confidence and make the following guarantees to you:

First, we will resolutely fight against the last small handful of major thieves who refuse to confess, and we will never stop fighting until a complete victory is achieved.

Second, we will actively participate in the democratic supplementary education movement, rectify the trade union organization, and purify and expand the ranks of the working class.

Third, we will universally establish and revise patriotic covenants, and strengthen the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea with practical actions.

Fourth, on the basis of the victory of the Five-Anti Movement, we will hold labor-capital consultation meetings well; conscientiously supervise capitalists to ensure that they conduct legal business; rapidly restore and develop business, in order to prepare for the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and welcome "May Day."

Respectfully wishing you good health

Enlarged Meeting of Cadres and Activists of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union

April 23, 1952

    天津市店员工会干部积极分子扩大会议
    向毛主席报告“五反”运动的巨大成绩
    要在五反胜利的基础上团结资方发展业务迎接“五一”
    中国店员工会天津市委员会在二十三日举行干部积极分子扩大会议。会中一致通过上书毛主席，报告全市店员在五反运动中的成绩，并表示要在五反运动胜利的基础上，开好劳资协商会议，在共同纲领的基础上，改善劳资关系，团结资方迅速恢复和发展业务，监督经营，防止资方再施五毒，以作好增产节约的准备工作，迎接“五一”劳动节。信的内容如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的英明领导下，我们天津市的七万店员工人，在五反运动的斗争中取得了辉煌的胜利。全市百分之九十五的店员都积极参加了五反运动，有九千多店员直接参加了“打虎队”、检查组；在运动中涌现出了六千五百九十八个新的积极分子；争取团结了二千九百五十二个高级职员参加五反战斗；同时，有五千多店员参加了工会，更加壮大了工会组织。自一月六日至目前止，据不完全的统计，全市店员共检举了不法资本家的违法事实达八万四千余件，突破了三百三十二起攻守同盟；查获了八千六百六十二本后账；检查出违法所得一亿元以上的不法资本家一千零二十八个，其中有五十亿元至二百亿元的四十五个，二百亿元以上的三个。
    此外，为了巩固与扩大五反运动的胜利，我们在团结资本家迅速恢复与发展业务方面，也开始获得胜利。许多商店的营业额逐月增加。如顺记
    （昌记）杂货庄三月份的营业额较三年来营业最好月份多一倍，而四月份截至二十二日止又超过了三月份的营业额。在我们的团结与积极帮助下，资方也受到了感动。仅在天津市店员工会和天津市工商业联合会联合举办的资本家学习班中，就有六十四个商店的资本家增资扩大经营。如顺记（昌记）杂货庄第一次投资五亿元，第二次投资黄金二百四十两，第三次又投资黄金一百二十两。现在又有一百多个单位成立了劳资协商会议。
    我们全市七万店员充满胜利的信心向您提出保证：
    一、坚决向最后一小撮拒不坦白的大盗窃犯进行斗争，不到彻底胜利，决不收兵。
    二、积极参加民主补课运动，整顿工会组织，纯洁与扩大工人阶级的队伍。
    三、普遍订立与修订爱国公约，以实际行动，加强抗美援朝力量。
    四、在五反胜利的基础上，开好劳资协商会议；认真监督资本家，使其进行合法经营；迅速恢复与发展业务，以作好增产节约运动的准备工作，迎接“五一”劳动节。
    敬祝您身体健康
    中国店员工会天津市委员会干部积极分子扩大会议
    一九五二年四月二十三日
