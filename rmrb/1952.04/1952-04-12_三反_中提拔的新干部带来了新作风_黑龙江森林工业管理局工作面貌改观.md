    New Cadres Promoted During the "Three-Anti" Campaign Bring a New Style of Work: The Work of the Heilongjiang Forestry Industry Bureau Undergoes a Change

    Since the unfolding of the "Three-Anti" movement in the Heilongjiang Forestry Industry Bureau, the work team of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has systematically and methodically selected sixteen young people who are active in struggle, firm in their position, pure in their background, loyal, reliable, and promising to serve as section- and unit-level cadres.

    Although these newly promoted cadres possessed some work ability, they were regarded as "useless" and unable to unleash their enthusiasm and creativity when "tigers" were in power in the past. Now that the "tigers" have been caught, the stumbling blocks to progress have been removed, evil influences have been dispelled, and righteousness has risen, the work has quickly shown new improvements. For example, the Materials Section's Materials Unit is mainly responsible for identifying materials and making plans for the supply of materials and tools for use throughout the bureau. The former head of the unit, Han Shuqi, was a major embezzler. In the past, people believed that if Han Shuqi were removed, no one else could take over this work. However, the reality was quite the opposite. Gao Yushan, who was promoted to take on this work, not only participated in the anti-corruption struggle but also managed to handle the work and complete the two planned tasks that the major embezzler had previously accumulated, ensuring that work and production did not suffer. For example, the two ordering and processing plans for the "spring logging and floating" needed for corner posts and forest railway locomotive tire sets were all accumulated by the major embezzler Han Shuqi, which nearly delayed the floating and halted forest railway transportation. After Gao Yushan took office, he immediately focused on these two plans, sending specialists to Shenyang to order goods and providing tools in a timely manner, ensuring the "spring logging and floating" and forest railway transportation work.

    Yu Xuegang of the Materials Section was originally a twenty-one-year-old "small clerk" who was looked down upon. This time, after being promoted to head of the Management Unit of the section (the task is very important because the section has many large warehouses supplying materials and tools for the entire bureau), he established many systems in a very short period of time and systematically organized manpower to sort out all the chaotic and easily corruptible warehouses in a planned manner. In the past, there was no cafeteria, and the workers' lives were very hard. After Yu Xuegang took office, he first established a food management committee, strengthened the management system, and assigned someone to be responsible for improving life, which the masses were very satisfied with. The workers said, "Not only have the 'tigers' been beaten, but the lives have also improved with the new people as leading cadres." In addition, Yu Xuegang squeezed time between the anti-corruption and business work to focus on the education of workers, telling the workers the political significance of the "Three-Anti" struggle, enlightening the workers' class consciousness, and improving everyone's ideological level. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased, and work efficiency has generally improved. For example, in the clothing factory, each sewing worker could make thirty-two sets of single clothing a day in the past, but now each person can make forty sets a day. Although three workers are on sick leave, the total daily production has not decreased at all.

    Other newly promoted section and unit chiefs in various sections and units are also actively and proactively doing their work. For example, Li Wenxue, the newly promoted acting deputy section chief of the Operations Section, has gone deep into the forest areas to lead operations. Wang Futian, the newly promoted acting deputy section chief of the Capital Construction Section, in addition to participating in the anti-corruption struggle, is also actively preparing for major capital construction projects such as forest railways, road construction, and bridge building. Everyone is vigorously displaying their wisdom and making some achievements in different work positions. In particular, the spirit of these people being conscientious, working hard, developing democracy, being amiable and humble, sincere and simple, and closely linking with the masses is clearly different from the leading cadres of these departments in the past.

    “三反”中提拔的新干部带来了新作风
    黑龙江森林工业管理局工作面貌改观
    黑龙江森林工业管理局的“三反”运动展开以后，中共黑龙江省委工作队有计划有步骤地选拔了十六名斗争积极、立场坚定、出身纯洁、忠实可靠而又有培养前途的青年充当科、股级干部。
    这些被提拔的新干部虽然有些工作能力，但在过去“老虎”当权的时候，却被视为“无用”，而不能发挥积极性与创造性。现在，“老虎”捉住了，前进的绊脚石被搬掉了，邪气吹散，正气上升，因而工作很快就有了新的起色。如：材料科材料股主要是负责识别材料和作供应全局范围使用物资工具计划的；原任股长韩树奇是大贪污分子，以前人们认为：撤掉韩树奇别人拿不起来这摊工作。但事实却完全相反，被提拔来担任这个工作的高玉山，一方面参加反贪污斗争，一方面不仅把工作能担当起来，而且还把大贪污分子以前积压下的两个计划任务搞起来，使工作和生产没受到损失。如：“春采流送”需用的押角子和森林铁路机车轮套等两个订购和加工计划，全被大贪污分子韩树奇积压起来，险些拖延了流送和停止了森林铁路运输。高玉山到职后，马上就抓紧了这两项计划，派专人到沈阳定货，及时供应了工具，保证了“春采流送”和森林铁路运搬工作。
    材料科的于学刚，原是二十一岁的被人看不起的“小文书”；这次被提拔为该科管理股长后（任务很重要，因该科有供应全局物资、工具的大仓库很多），在很短时间里，就建立了很多制度，把过去乱无头绪最易贪污的所有仓库，有计划地组织人力进行了整理。过去没有食堂，工人生活很苦；于学刚接职后，就首先成立了伙食管理委员会，加强了管理制度，专人负责改善了生活，群众非常满意。工人们说：“不光打住了‘老虎’，换了新人当领导干部，生活也改善了。”另外，于学刚在反贪污和业务工作之间挤出了时间，抓紧了对工人的教育，给工友讲“三反”斗争的政治意义，启发工人的阶级觉悟，提高了大家的思想水平，因而工人群众的生产热劲普遍高涨，工作效率普遍提高。如被服厂，过去每个缝纽工人一天能做三十二套单衣，现在每人一天能做四十套；虽然有三个工人因病歇工，每天生产总数却毫未降低。
    其他各科、股新提拔的科长、股长，也都正在积极、主动地做工作。如：新提拔的作业科代理副科长李文学，已深入林区领导作业；基本建设科新提拔代理副科长王福田，除参加反贪污斗争外，也正积极张罗森林铁路、修路、筑桥等重大的基本建设工作。每个人都生龙活虎地在不同的工作岗位上发挥智慧，做出了一些成绩。特别是这些人兢兢业业、埋头苦干、发扬民主、和霭虚心、诚恳朴实、密切联系群众的作风，是与过去这些部门的领导干部显然不同的。  （吴殿坤）
