    Volunteer Army Commanders and Fighters, Convalescents, etc. Write to Express Full Confidence in Crushing American Bacteriological Warfare
    -- Reader Letters Summary

    This newspaper continues to receive letters from commanders, fighters, medical personnel, and convalescents of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army protesting against the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. These letters, in addition to condemning the crimes of the United States in carrying out bacteriological warfare, also express their determination and confidence in extinguishing American bacteriological warfare.

    Hao Tianyu and six others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "Recently, on the mornings after enemy planes came, large numbers of poisonous insects were found in our garrison area. Large numbers of poisonous insects were also found on the roofs of Korean people's houses. The crime of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare is irrefutable." Ren Jianhua and eight others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We have personally seen the American imperialist aerial bandits drop many poisonous insects in our garrison area."

    All comrades of the Fourth Company of a certain artillery unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "The American man-eating savages' despicable use of bacteriological weapons has further aroused our determination to strike them severely. We are determined to follow the will of the people of the motherland and give the crazy bandits a fatal blow." All comrades of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We are fully confident of thwarting the enemy's bacteriological warfare and all conspiracies. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of the motherland and the people of the world, final victory will definitely belong to us." Chen Mingyuan and forty-seven other female comrades from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We have made the greatest determination to work a hundred times harder in our respective positions to fight to crush the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism."

    The medical surgery team of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We medical workers are determined to do everything in our power to protect the health of the Chinese and Korean people's troops and the Korean people in order to fight back against American imperialism." Fang Yuzhen and twenty-one other female comrades from the logistics medical institute of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "The enemy's inhumane bacteriological warfare has further increased our will to fight. We will work even more actively to crush all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism." Liu Yongnian and four others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We are railway workers volunteering to aid Korea. We guarantee to transport the materials donated by the people of the motherland to the front lines quickly and safely to support the Volunteer Army, so as to crush the conspiracies of the American aggressors as soon as possible."

    Zhang Yifei, Li Min, and others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We are a group of Volunteer Army personnel recuperating in the motherland. We must recover our health as soon as possible and strive to return to the forefront of resisting America and aiding Korea as soon as possible. We are determined and confident to completely eliminate the American aerial bandits spreading bacteria on the Korean battlefield." Wang Peisen and forty-three other convalescents from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We must recuperate with peace of mind and strive to return to the front lines as soon as possible to strike the American aggressors severely." He Jinhan, a disabled veteran of the Volunteer Army, wrote: "Although my body is disabled because of fighting the American devils, my spirit is very healthy. I am ready at any time to go to the position where the motherland needs me and, with practical actions, support the Volunteer Army comrades and fight the American aggressors who are conducting bacteriological warfare to the end."
