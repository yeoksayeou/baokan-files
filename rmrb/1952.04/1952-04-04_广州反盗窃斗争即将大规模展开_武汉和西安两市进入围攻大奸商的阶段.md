Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 1st: Guangzhou City has completed preparations for launching the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, and has achieved victory in the preliminary battle. The great struggle to repel the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks is about to unfold.

Preparations for the movement began in late January. Around the Spring Festival, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life and meetings of workers and shop assistants, respectively. They explained the serious significance of the "Five-Anti" movement to the people of the city, especially workers and shop assistants, conveyed the government's policies, and mobilized workers, shop assistants, and all patriotic people to resolutely rise up and counter the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks. The Municipal People's Government also announced four regulations to protect the people's right to report illegal capitalists. Many workers and shop assistants immediately responded to the government's call and exposed a large number of crimes committed by illegal capitalists. People from all walks of life also joined the ranks of the "Five-Anti" struggle one after another. Under the leadership of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Youth League members among the shop assistants played an active role. Mo Derun, a Youth League member and shop assistant at the Victory Pharmacy, has been recognized as a model in the struggle. In schools, touching stories emerged of Youth League member Wu Qiting and Young Pioneer member Qian Yuanwen reporting their illegal fathers. More than 15,000 members of neighborhood youth groups under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Democratic Youth Federation also frequently participated in the "Five-Anti" propaganda work. More than 3,000 teachers and students responded to the government's call and joined the work teams. The Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also led women to participate in the reporting. In more than two months, the "Five-Anti" Movement Committee of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee received nearly 100,000 pieces of reporting material from workers, shop assistants, and people from all walks of life. Many illegal capitalists also initially confessed to their own illegal acts. However, some illegal capitalists used despicable and malicious methods such as work stoppages, wage stoppages, and food stoppages to attack the reporting by workers and shop assistants. The workers and shop assistants held reasoning and struggle meetings to fight back against their counterattacks and maintain production. The Municipal People's Government resolutely supported the just actions of the workers and shop assistants and severely punished these illegal capitalists who dared to disrupt the movement.

The preliminary battle of the "Five-Anti" struggle began in late February. In order to gain experience and train cadres, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee selected four key industries, namely, the new medicine industry, the new medicine commercial industry, the rice and grain processing industry, and the vegetable oil industry, for experimentation. This preliminary battle has now basically ended. The general process of the work was: first, worker and shop assistant representative meetings were held in these industries to explain the policies, and then work teams entered the factories and shops to conduct patriotic education and class education for the workers and shop assistants, mobilize the masses, strive to unite senior staff members, and call on them to actively fight against illegal capitalists. After fully collecting materials, labor-capital face-to-face reasoning and legal struggle meetings were held. At this time, many capitalists, under the power of the worker masses and with the real evidence already seized, lowered their heads and confessed their guilt, confessed and repented, and expressed their willingness to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. However, some illegal capitalists still attempted to resist stubbornly, and the inspection team conducted inspections of them. Finally, according to the illegal capitalists' confessions and the degree of repentance, they were dealt with separately according to the law.

While the key experiment was being carried out, the anti-corruption struggle in government offices also exposed serious crimes committed by many illegal capitalists, such as smuggling a large number of strategic materials for export to aid the enemy, smuggling rice for export and toxic substances for import, and severely disrupting the country's foreign trade policies through group smuggling. The Municipal People's Government immediately arrested and dealt with those who were extremely guilty according to the law, and the rest were thoroughly investigated in the "Five-Anti" movement.

Currently, it is on the eve of the "Five-Anti" struggle's great advance, and the following work is being intensified: (1) Summarizing the pilot experience, helping cadres improve their ideological level and policy level, master correct working methods, and arouse their greater enthusiasm to lead this struggle. (2) Strengthening the organization, expanding the "Five-Anti" Movement Committee, absorbing outstanding workers and shop assistants who emerged in the struggle of more than two months to participate in the leadership, and at the same time reorganizing and expanding the struggle team, mobilizing a large number of worker and shop assistant activists to participate in the work. (3) Massively training workers, shop assistants, and senior staff members to raise their class consciousness, inspire their fighting will, learn policies and methods, and master the weapons of struggle. (4) The Chinese Communist Party's reporters and propagandists, and a propaganda army of 10,000 people composed of teachers, students, and Cantonese opera and folk art circles, are mobilized to all corners of the city to widely publicize the significance of the "Five-Anti" struggle, so as to ensure that it reaches every household.

[This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency: The "Five-Anti" movement in Wuhan and Xi'an, which began in early February, has victoriously concluded the first and second stages of the battle respectively, due to the implementation of the policy of fully mobilizing shop assistants, workers, and staff members. Now both cities have entered the stage of besieging big profiteers.

The "Five-Anti" movement in Wuhan began on February 1st, and the first stage lasted until February 20th. This stage mainly called on illegal capitalists to automatically and thoroughly confess and repent; at the same time, it mobilized the vast number of workers, shop assistants, and staff members to report, and dispatched key inspection teams to conduct inspections. The movement entered the second stage on March 1st. The characteristics of this stage were: on the one hand, it began to comprehensively deal with illegal industrial and commercial households who confessed and repented; on the other hand, inspections were carried out comprehensively in more than 80 industrial and commercial sectors. This stage also came to a victorious conclusion on March 20th.

The most important reason why the "Five-Anti" movement in Wuhan achieved great victory was that it widely mobilized workers, shop assistants, and staff members, and in the process of mobilizing the worker masses, it firmly grasped two key points, namely: "conducting class education in a concrete and vivid manner to achieve ideological mobilization" and "fully attaching importance to and doing a good job in mobilizing senior staff members and older staff members." According to statistics, the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee has basically verified the criminal facts of 264 large profiteers, who stole 383.5 billion yuan of state property (excluding large theft groups). Currently, 20,269 law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and half-law-abiding and half-illegal households have been dealt with and conclusions have been made, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of industrial and commercial households in the city.

The fighting team for encircling and suppressing profiteers in Wuhan City was reorganized and expanded while fighting. During the movement, it was discovered that there were serious organizational impurities in the grassroots trade unions. Therefore, on the one hand, class dissidents, feudal remnants, and other bad elements who had sneaked in were purged in large numbers during the rectification of the team. On the other hand, through the test of struggle, a large number of activists were absorbed to increase fresh blood. Work teams supplemented inspection teams, combat teams supplemented work teams, and shop assistants, workers, and staff members participated in combat teams. After 50 days of fierce fighting, this team became stronger and stronger. Before and after March 20th, the worker combat team for encircling and suppressing profiteers underwent a second large-scale reorganization and training. It is now entering a new battle position under the slogan of "continue to fully mobilize the masses, make persistent efforts, and strive for the complete victory of the 'Five-Anti' struggle."

The "Five-Anti" movement in Xi'an began on February 5th. The first battle was to universally mobilize the masses, convene various meetings, publicize policies, and call for confession and reporting. In March, the second battle began, focusing on reviewing and dealing with law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and half-law-abiding and half-illegal households. Currently, about 95% of the total number of industrial and commercial households in the city have been dealt with as law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and half-law-abiding and half-illegal households. The industrial and commercial households that were dealt with were grateful for the leniency of the People's Government and quickly joined the fighting ranks. This completely isolated the big profiteers. Now the battle to encircle and suppress the big profiteers has begun in an all-round way. In the week before this, each district summarized the combat experience, studied and analyzed the illegal facts of seriously illegal households and completely illegal households, universally trained senior staff members in these two types of factories and shops, and drew out most of the cadres participating in the "Five-Anti" and the activist shop assistants to give them policy education. Subsequently, more than 300 inspection teams were formed and put into battle. In addition, a group of industrial and commercial operators who had been treated leniently were absorbed to form persuasion groups to persuade illegal capitalists. At present, in the battle to encircle and suppress the big profiteers, each district first uses persuasion groups to persuade, followed by interrogations by inspection teams. If persuasion fails, the inspection team will enter the factory and shop to conduct inspections. In this battle, each district also drew out a group of people to do follow-up work, namely, rectifying the trade unions, developing new members, revising collective labor-capital contracts, urging industrial and commercial operators to sign "patriotic and law-abiding covenants," and quickly restoring production.

    广州反盗窃斗争即将大规模展开
    武汉和西安两市进入围攻大奸商的阶段
    【新华社广州一日电】广州市已完成了开展反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的准备工作，并取得了序幕战的胜利，打退资产阶级猖狂进攻的大斗争，即将展开。
    运动的准备工作是在一月下旬就开始的。春节前后，广州市人民政府、市总工会筹备会曾分别召开各界人民代表会议和工人、店员代表会议，向全市人民，特别是工人、店员，说明了“五反”运动的严重意义，传达了政府的政策，动员工人、店员和一切爱国人民坚决起来反击资产阶级的猖狂进攻。市人民政府同时宣布了四项保障人民检举违法资本家的权利的条例。许多工人、店员立即响应人民政府的号召，大量揭发了违法资本家的罪证。各界人民也相继投入“五反”斗争的行列。在中国新民主主义青年团领导下，店员中的青年团员发挥了积极作用，胜利药房店员、青年团员莫德润在斗争中已被公认为模范。在学校里也出现了青年团员吴绮婷、少年儿童队员钱元文检举不法的父亲的动人事迹。在市民主青年联合会筹备会领导下的街坊青年组的一万五千多组员也经常参加“五反”的宣传工作。三千多教师学生响应政府号召参加了工作队。市民主妇女联合会也领导妇女群众参加检举。在两个多月内，市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会收到工人、店员和各界人民的检举材料接近十万件。许多违法资本家也初步坦白了他们自己的犯法行为。但也有一些违法资本家用停工、停薪、停伙等卑鄙恶毒的手段来打击工人、店员的检举。工人、店员们就举行说理斗争会来回击他们的反扑并维持生产。市人民政府坚决支持工人、店员的正义行动，给予这些敢于破坏运动的违法资本家以严厉的制裁。
    二月下旬开始了“五反”斗争的序幕战。市“五反”运动委员会为取得经验、训练干部，选择了新药工业、新药商业、米粮加工业和植物油业等四个重点行业进行试验。这场序幕战现在已基本结束。工作的一般过程是：首先举行了这些行业的工人、店员代表会议，交代政策，然后工作组即进入厂店，向工人店员进行爱国主义教育和阶级教育，发动群众，争取团结高级职员，号召他们积极起来和违法资本家作斗争。在充分搜集了材料后，就举行劳资见面说理说法斗争。这时，许多资本家在工人群众的威力和真赃实证已被拿获的情况下，低头认罪，坦白悔过，并表示愿立功自赎。可是有一部分违法资本家还企图进行顽抗，检查组就对他们进行检查。最后，根据违法资本家的坦白和悔过程度，按照法令分别予以议处。
    在重点试验的同时，机关反贪污斗争也揭露了许多违法资本家的严重罪行，如大量偷运战略物资出口资敌，偷运大米出口和毒物进口，严重破坏国家对外贸易政策的集团走私等。市人民政府对其中罪大恶极的，立即予以逮捕法办，其余就在“五反”运动中对他们深入追查。
    目前是“五反”斗争大进军的前夕，现正加紧进行下列工作：（一）总结试点经验，帮助干部提高思想水平和政策水平，掌握正确的工作方法，鼓起他们更大的热情来领导这场斗争。（二）加强组织，扩大“五反”运动委员会，吸收在两个多月的斗争中涌现的优秀工人、店员参加领导，同时整编和扩大斗争队伍，动员大批工人、店员积极分子参加工作。（三）大量训练工人、店员和高级职员，提高他们的阶级觉悟，鼓舞斗争意志，学习政策和方法，掌握斗争武器。（四）中国共产党的报告员、宣传员，和由学校师生、粤剧曲艺界组成的万人宣传大军，出动全市各角落，广泛宣传“五反”斗争的意义，务期达到家喻户晓。 【本报讯】据新华社讯：武汉和西安两市的“五反”运动，从二月初开始以来，由于贯彻执行了充分发动店员职工群众的方针，已经分别胜利结束了第一阶段和第二阶段的战斗，现在都已进入围攻大奸商的阶段。
    武汉市的“五反”运动，在二月一日开始，到二月二十日为第一阶段。这个阶段主要是号召违法资本家自动彻底坦白悔过；同时发动广大工人、店员和职员进行检举，并且派出重点检查组进行检查。运动从三月一日起进入第二阶段，这一阶段的特点是：一方面开始全面地处理坦白悔过的违法工商业户；一方面在八十多个工商行业中，全面进行检查。这一阶段到三月二十日也告胜利结束。
    武汉市“五反”运动所以取得伟大胜利，最主要的是广泛地发动了工人、店员和职员，并在发动工人群众的过程中，紧紧地掌握着两个关键，即：“具体生动地进行阶级教育，做到思想发动”和“充分重视和做好发动高级职员和老年职员的工作。”据统计，武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会已经基本上查清了二百六十四户大奸商的犯罪事实，他们盗窃国家财产达三千八百三十五亿元（还不包括大盗窃集团在内）。目前已经处理并做出结论的守法户、基本守法户、半守法半违法户有二万零二百六十九户，占全市工商业总户数的百分之五十以上。
    武汉市围剿奸商的战斗队伍，边打仗，边整编，边扩大。运动中发现基层工会存在着严重的组织不纯现象，于是，一方面在整顿队伍中大量清洗了钻进来的阶级异己分子、封建残余分子以及其他坏分子。另一方面通过斗争的考验，大量吸收积极分子，增加新的血液。工作队补充检查队，战斗队补充工作队，店员职工群众参加战斗队。五十天鏖战，这支队伍便越打越壮大，愈战愈坚强。二月初，在反贪污联合检查委员会统率下，只不过千多人员，现在，已成为拥有一万二千多人的坚强的队伍了。围剿奸商的工人战斗队伍，在三月二十日前后进行了第二次大整训。现正在“继续充分发动群众，再接再厉，争取‘五反’斗争全部胜利”的口号下，进入了新的战斗岗位。
    西安市“五反”运动从二月五日开始。第一个战役是普遍发动群众、召开各种会议，宣传政策，号召坦白和检举。三月份开始了以审查和处理守法户、基本守法户和半守法半违法户为内容的第二个战役。现在，全市已经处理的守法户、基本守法户和半守法半违法户，约占工商户总数的百分之九十五。被处理的工商户感激人民政府的宽大处理，迅速加入战斗行列。这样就使大奸商陷于完全孤立。现在围攻大奸商的战役已经全面开始。在这以前的一个星期中，各区都总结了战斗经验，研究和分析了严重违法户和完全违法户的违法事实，普遍训练了这两类厂、店中的高级职员，又抽调出大部分参加“五反”的干部和店员积极分子，给以政策教育，随后组成三百多个检查组投入战斗。此外，还吸收了一部分被宽大处理的工商业者组成劝导小组，向违法资本家进行规劝工作。目前各区在围攻大奸商的战斗中，都先由规劝组规劝，继由检查组传问。规劝不下时检查组就开进厂、店进行检查。在这一个战役中，各区还抽调了一部分人员做善后工作，即整顿工会，发展新会员，修订劳资集体合同，督促工商业者订立“爱国守法公约”，迅速恢复生产。
