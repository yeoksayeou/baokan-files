    Relying on the Masses to Accomplish the Sacred Mission
    Pu Jiexiu, Judge of the Beijing People's Court, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

    In order to ensure the smooth and complete conclusion of the "Five-Anti" movement in Beijing, and to seriously, cautiously, and appropriately handle the cases of industrial and commercial households with serious and complete violations of the law, as well as other cases that should be handled through judicial procedures, the Beijing People's Court was formally established according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council.

    I am honored to be appointed as a judge of the Beijing People's Court. I have no experience in legal work and feel deeply the weight of responsibility and my own insignificance, fearing that I will not be able to fulfill the task. But when I think of the great power of the masses and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, I gain unlimited confidence in completing the mission.

    The People's Court represents the will of the people, adjudicating and handling all cases in the "Five-Anti" movement that seriously endanger the interests of the state and the people. In order to do this work well, we must rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, conduct thorough investigation and research, and fully grasp the information; and under the leadership of the People's Government, handle cases with principle and differentiation, according to the "Standards and Methods for Categorized Handling of Industrial and Commercial Households in the Five-Anti Movement" issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the five basic principles instructed by Chairman Mao.

    Women and family members of industrial and commercial circles have shown positive performance in the "Five-Anti" movement. To do a good job in the trial work, we hope that the women's community can give active support and provide me with necessary help, extensively collect relevant information for the government's reference, so that the trial work can proceed smoothly and completely conclude the "Five-Anti" movement.

    依靠群众，完成神圣使命
    北京市人民法庭审判员  北京市工商联副主任委员  浦洁修
    为了保障北京市“五反”运动顺利完满的结束，严肃地谨慎地和适时地处理“五反”运动中工商户严重违法和完全违法的案件，以及其他应经审判程序处理的案件，北京市人民法庭根据政务院的指示，正式成立了。
    我荣幸地被任为北京市人民法庭的审判员。我对法律工作毫无经验，接受这个工作深感责任的重大和自己的渺小，唯恐不能胜任。但我想到了群众的伟大力量和中国共产党、人民政府的正确领导，我便增加了完成使命的无限信心。
    人民法庭代表着人民的意旨，裁判和处理在“五反”运动中一切严重危害国家人民利益的案件。为了把这一工作做好，我们一定依靠群众，发动群众，认真进行调查研究，充分掌握资料；并在人民政府的领导下，根据北京市人民政府“在五反运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”和毛主席指示的五项基本原则，有原则有区别地来处理案件。
    妇女界及工商界的家庭妇女，在“五反”运动中都有了积极的表现；要做好审判工作，更盼望妇女界能予积极支持，给我必要的帮助，广泛地搜集有关资料提供政府参考，使审判工作能够顺利进行，完满地结束“五反”运动。
