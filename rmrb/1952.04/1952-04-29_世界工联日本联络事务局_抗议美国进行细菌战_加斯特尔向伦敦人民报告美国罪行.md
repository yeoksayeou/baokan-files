Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: Tokyo dispatch: Watanabe Michio, representing the World Federation of Trade Unions Japanese Liaison Office, wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressor troops in Korea be stopped.

The letter stated: The World Federation of Trade Unions Japanese Liaison Office, representing the Japanese working class, demands national independence and peace in Asia and the world, and supports the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau's strong condemnation of the United States' germ warfare.

The letter pointed out: During World War II, Japanese militarists not only used Chinese and Soviet people to experiment with bacteriological weapons but also widely used these weapons in Chinese territory, killing many people. Now, American imperialists are shielding germ warfare criminals and using active researchers of germ warfare, turning our country into a germ warfare base. In Kobe, one of the ports with the most frequent traffic between Japan and Korea, dysentery is rampant even though it is not a time when infectious diseases are prevalent. Japanese workers at the Shibaura Port in Tokyo, who handle uniforms sent back from Korea, are forced to undergo preventive injections. This means that germ warfare has already become a reality. Therefore, the Japanese people's sense of unease is deepening. Many Japanese people died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which suffered atomic bomb attacks. We are filled with more anger and disgust at the terrible bacteriological weapons than at the aforementioned facts.

The letter concluded: We now demand that the United Nations, based on the principle of guaranteeing basic human rights, take measures to achieve the following: prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons and punish the criminals who launched germ warfare in Korea; stop the criminal activities in Korea and ensure that all foreign troops withdraw from Korean territory.

Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: TASS, London, April 26th: The Britain-China Friendship Association and the London Peace Council jointly held a meeting at the Soroptimist Hall on the evening of April 25th to protest against the US bacteriological warfare in China and Korea.

Gaster, the British member of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team that investigated the crimes committed by American aggressors in Korea, reported on the materials obtained by the investigation team. The audience cried out in horror when they heard the facts of American war crimes and observed a minute of silence after Gaster's speech to express their condolences to the victims of American atrocities.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution. The resolution said: We, the people of London, are shocked to hear that bacteriological weapons are apparently being used against the people of China and Korea. We express our strongest protest and demand that the government take all possible steps to stop this practice immediately.

The conference pledged to work to promote the withdrawal of British troops from Korea.

The conference passed a resolution requesting that Gaster and Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, who had investigated American war crimes in the Far East, be allowed to describe their experiences to the British people on the BBC radio network.

Wen Youzhang said at the meeting: In the world peace movement, the people of all countries have already grasped a weapon that can and will defeat the United States' actions to create a Third World War.

    抗议美国进行细菌战
    加斯特尔向伦敦人民报告美国罪行
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：渡边三知夫代表世界工联日本联络事务局写信给联合国秘书长，要求制止美国侵略军在朝鲜使用细菌武器。
    这封信说：世界工联日本联络事务局代表日本工人阶级要求民族独立与亚洲和世界的和平，并拥护世界工会联合会及世界工联亚澳联络局坚决谴责美国进行细菌战的声明。
    这封信指出：第二次世界大战时，日本军国主义者不但把中国人和苏联人用来实验细菌武器，并且在中国领土广泛使用这种武器，杀害了许许多多的人。现在美帝国主义者又袒护细菌战犯，利用研究细菌战的积极分子，变我国为细菌战基地。在连结日本与朝鲜之间的港口之中，出入最频繁的一个港口——神户，虽然不是在传染病流行时期，但却猖狂地流行着痢疾。东京芝浦港处理由朝鲜送回的军装的日本工人被迫实行预防注射。这就是说，细菌战已经成为事实了。因此，日本人越来越加深了不安的情绪。遭受到原子弹轰炸的广岛和长崎死了许多日本人。我们对于可怕的细菌武器比上述事实更充满了忿怒和憎恶。
    这封信最后说：我们现在要求联合国根据保障基本人权的原则，采取措施以实现下列事项：禁止使用细菌武器，惩处在朝鲜发动细菌战的罪犯；制止在朝鲜的犯罪勾当、使外国军队全部自朝鲜领土撤退。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：英中友好协会和伦敦和平理事会于四月二十五日傍晚在索尔波思大厅联合召开大会，抗议美国在中国和朝鲜进行细菌战。
    曾经调查了美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯罪行的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团英籍团员加斯特尔报告了调查团调查所得的材料。听众在听到美国战争罪行的事实时都惊恐地叫喊起来，并在加斯特尔演说结束后静默一分钟，对美国暴行下的牺牲者表示哀悼。
    大会一致通过一项决议。决议说：我们伦敦人民听说有人显然对中国和朝鲜人民使用细菌武器，都非常震惊。我们特提出最强烈的抗议，并要求政府采取各种可能的步骤立即制止这种行为。
    大会保证为促使英军自朝鲜撤退而努力。
    大会通过决议，要求允许加斯特尔和曾调查美国在远东的战争罪行的加拿大和平大会主席文幼章在英国广播公司广播网上向英国人民叙述他们的所见所闻。
    文幼章在会上说：在世界和平运动中，世界各国人民已经掌握了一个武器，这武器可以而且一定会击败美国制造第三次世界大战的行动。
