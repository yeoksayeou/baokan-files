Response to Readers' Criticism and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The reader's letter published in the People's Daily on April 5th criticized the mistake of cadres in our county's organs and districts neglecting to read the newspaper. We believe this criticism is very correct. This criticism has prompted us to pay attention to the work of leading the reading of newspapers. As criticized in the newspaper, the situation of neglecting reading the newspaper is indeed very serious among many cadres in our county. We examined the reasons for this phenomenon. First, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee made a bureaucratic error in leading the study. After the launch of the "Three-Anti" Movement, although we stipulated that one hour a day should be used to study the important policies related to the "Three-Anti" in the newspaper, this regulation remained only at the level of arrangement, without specific inspection, so that the situation of neglecting to read the newspaper could not be discovered and corrected in time. Second, the responsible cadres of various economic departments did not pay enough attention to the cadres' current affairs and political studies. They one-sidedly emphasized that business was busy, did not give cadres a certain amount of time to read the newspaper, and did not seriously lead cadres to study. Therefore, leading cadres relaxed political leadership over staff, and many cadres neglected politics, fostering a purely business viewpoint.
    In order to thoroughly correct this phenomenon, the County Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres responsible for leading study in various organs on April 6th, criticizing and examining the erroneous idea of neglecting reading the newspaper, and emphatically pointed out that the leadership's attention and leading cadres taking the lead are the key to doing a good job in reading the newspaper. At the meeting, we decided: First, various organs should hold different meetings to explain the important significance of studying the Party newspaper to all cadres, and organize everyone to discuss the criticisms in the newspaper, so that everyone can recognize that the Party newspaper is an important weapon for improving ideological level and guiding practical work. Second, various organs should formulate specific methods according to different situations, adhere to one hour of reading the newspaper every day, and reporters should make reports on current affairs and politics every Friday and Saturday. Third, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee should promptly designate major issues in the newspaper every day as learning materials and uniformly arrange them to various units; and promptly check and help the study of various units, conduct periodic tests, conduct criticism and praise, and cultivate cadres' consciousness of learning. In addition, for the reading and study of cadres in various districts, in addition to instructing various districts to conduct in-depth inspections, we also stipulated that the responsible cadres of each district should lead the cadres in their district to conduct regular reading and study, and provide tutoring to comrades with low cultural levels.

### 中共香河县委员会宣传部关于忽视领导读报的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共香河县委员会宣传部关于忽视领导读报的检讨
    编辑同志：四月五日人民日报发表的读者来信，批评了我县机关及各区干部忽视读报的错误，我们认为这一批评非常正确。这一批评促使我们对领导读报工作引起了重视。正如报上所批评的，在我县不少干部中忽视读报的情形确实很严重。我们检讨了造成这种现象的原因，首先是因为县委宣传部在领导学习上犯了官僚主义的错误。在“三反”运动开展以后，我们虽曾规定用每天一小时的时间学习报纸上有关“三反”的重要政策，但这一规定仍只是停留在布置上，没有具体检查，以至对忽视读报的情况未能及时发现和纠正。第二，各经济部门的负责干部对干部的时事和政治学习重视不够。他们片面地强调业务忙，不给干部一定的读报时间，更没有去认真地领导干部学习。因此，领导干部放松了对工作人员的政治领导，不少干部忽视政治，滋长了单纯业务观点。
    为了彻底纠正这种现象，县委在四月六日召集了各机关负责领导学习的干部开会，批判和检讨了忽视读报的错误思想，着重指出，领导方面重视和领导干部以身作则，是搞好读报的关键。会上我们决定：第一，各机关分别召开各种不同的会议，向全体干部说明学习党报的重要意义，并组织大家对报纸上的批评进行讨论，使大家认识党报是提高思想水平指导实际工作的重要武器。第二，各机关按照不同情况订出具体办法，每天坚持一小时读报，每星期五、六由报告员作有关时事和政治的报告。第三，县委宣传部及时指定每天报纸上的重大问题作为学习材料，统一布置到各单位去；并且及时检查和帮助各单位的学习，定期进行测验，进行批评和表扬，培养干部的学习自觉性。此外，对于各区干部的读报学习，我们除指示各区作深刻检查外，并规定由各区负责干部领导本区干部进行经常的读报学习，并对文化水平低的同志给以辅导。
