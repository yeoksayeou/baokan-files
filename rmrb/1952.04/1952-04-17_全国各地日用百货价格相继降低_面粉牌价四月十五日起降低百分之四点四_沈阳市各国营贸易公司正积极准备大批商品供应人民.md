【This Newspaper News】Recently, state-owned trading departments across the country have successively reduced the list prices of a large number of daily-use industrial products and flour. This is the victory fruit obtained by the broad masses of people from the anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement, and anti-bureaucratism movement, and it is a major event in the economic life of the people across the country.

Shanghai is the main production base of daily-use merchandise in the country, and about 80 percent of the daily necessities across the country are supplied by Shanghai. Therefore, since Shanghai lowered the prices of more than 10,000 kinds of commodities in mid-March, the list prices of department stores in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shenyang, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xi'an have also been reasonably reduced accordingly. The range of price reductions for daily-use industrial products in various places ranges from about 2 to 40 percent. The average reduction range is about 8 percent. The extent of these price reductions in daily-use industrial brands is determined by the state-owned trading departments in accordance with the principle of developing production, while taking into account the specific production and market conditions in different regions. For example, the technical equipment of factories in the inland areas is relatively outdated, so the price reduction range of commodities in inland cities is lower than that in coastal cities. In terms of the types of goods that have been reduced in price, there are more than 10,000 kinds in Shanghai, nearly 4,000 kinds in Beijing, more than 3,000 kinds in Wuhan and various parts of Central and South China, about 900 kinds in the Northwest, more than 600 kinds in various parts of the Northeast, and 1,500 kinds in various parts of the Southwest.

Following the reduction in the list prices of daily-use industrial products in various places, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government instructed state-owned trading departments across the country on April 6 to universally reduce flour list prices starting from April 15. In thirteen major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Xi'an, and Jinan, the average reduction range is 4.4 percent, and the reduction amount is 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per bag.

The general reduction in prices directly promotes the welfare of the broad masses of people, especially the welfare of wage-earning laborers and farmers. For example, the daily sales volume of Chongqing Department Store retail outlets has increased by 26.4 percent compared with before the price reduction; the sales volume of Wuhan Department Store in early April increased by 18 percent compared with the average sales volume in mid-to-late March; the sales of soap alone in Shenyang Department Store on April 12th and 13th increased by 44 percent compared with the two days before the price reduction; Shanghai Department Store First Retail Outlet's daily sales of soap increased by 60 percent, toothpaste by 50 percent, and towels by 40 percent after the price reduction compared with before. This fully demonstrates that people's purchasing power has relatively increased. As a result, the labor enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of people are also higher.

At the same time, due to the reduction in list prices by state-owned trading companies, the prices of commodities in the free market have also fallen, and transactions have become more active. Due to the stability of agricultural product prices and the decline in industrial product prices, the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products has been greatly reduced, and the purchasing power of the broad masses of farmers has been increased, which has opened up a broader market for industrial products. Therefore, the reasonable reduction in the prices of industrial products is of great significance to the development of industry and commerce.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: Various state-owned trading companies in Shenyang are preparing large quantities of goods to supply the people. The Shenyang Wholesale Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has re-signed a large number of fabric processing contracts with private weaving and dyeing factories throughout the city; in addition to signing oil and rice processing contracts with public and private oil mills and rice mills throughout the city, the Shenyang Company of the China Grain Company is also organizing handicraft mills throughout the city through grassroots cooperatives to process corn flour. The Shenyang Company of the China Department Store Company has submitted plans to the North China and East China companies of the China Department Store Company for the allocation of a large number of department stores, and has sent specialists to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai to purchase high-end goods. The two processing plants affiliated with the department store are processing knitted goods, spring and summer clothing, shoes, hats and other items to meet the large needs of employees throughout the city before and after the "May 1st" holiday.

In order to quickly promote the sales of goods to the citizens, the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has stipulated that all agencies and organizations that need a large amount of fabrics can directly order from the company, and the retail department specializes in supplying the needs of the citizens. The department store will soon begin to investigate the needs of agencies and organizations. In addition to directly supplying the needs of citizens, the business units affiliated with the department store will strengthen the supply of materials to more than 100 grassroots cooperatives throughout the city and try to meet the requirements of the cooperatives.

Due to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements which rectified the work style of state-owned commercial staff and initially corrected the illegal acts of private manufacturers in processing, the quality of several major commodities has been greatly improved. For example, the fabrics supplied by the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company can basically guarantee that they will not fade or shrink after being washed, and the phenomenon of mixing third-class fabrics or out-of-grade fabrics into first- and second-class fabrics has been eliminated. The sorghum rice supplied by the Grain Company is not only white in color, but also the husk, bran, and broken rice in the rice are almost completely eliminated. Due to the above reasons, the prestige of state-owned commerce among citizens is increasing day by day, and market sales are gradually expanding. The total daily sales revenue of the department store at the end of March increased by one and a half times compared with a month ago, and it is estimated that the total supply of materials in the second quarter of this year will exceed 170 percent of the same period last year. The amount of cotton cloth supplied by the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to citizens in March increased by 96.87 percent compared with the amount of cloth sold in February. The average daily supply of grain to citizens by the Grain Company in late March also increased by 47.23 percent compared with a month ago.

    全国各地日用百货价格相继降低
    面粉牌价四月十五日起降低百分之四点四
    沈阳市各国营贸易公司正积极准备大批商品供应人民
    【本报讯】最近全国各地国营贸易部门相继降低大批日用工业品和面粉的牌价。这是广大人民从反贪污反盗窃运动中获得的胜利果实，是全国人民经济生活中的一件大事。
    上海市是全国日用百货的主要产地，全国各地日用品约有百分之八十是由上海供给的，因此，自三月中旬上海降低一万多种商品价格以来，北京、天津、南京、沈阳、重庆、武汉、广州、西安等大城市的百货牌价，也随着合理降低。各地日用工业品牌价降低的幅度，由百分之二至四十左右。平均降低幅度在百分之八左右。这些日用工业品牌价降低的幅度，是国营贸易部门按照发展生产的方针，同时照顾不同地区的生产和市场的具体情况来决定的。例如内地工厂的技术设备较陈旧，所以内地城市的商品牌价降低的幅度即低于沿海城市。以降价商品的种类来说，上海有一万多种，北京将近四千种，武汉和中南各地三千多种，西北约九百种，东北各地六百多种，西南各地一千五百种。
    继各地日用工业品降低牌价之后，中央人民政府贸易部又在四月六日指示全国各地国营贸易部门，自四月十五日起普遍降低面粉牌价。北京、天津、上海、汉口、西安、济南等十三个主要城市，平均降低幅度为百分之四点四，降低金额每袋为三千元至四千元。
    物价的普遍降低，直接增进了广大人民的福利，特别增进了工薪劳动者和农民的福利。例如从重庆市百货公司门市部销售额每天比降低牌价前增加百分之二六点四；武汉市百货公司四月上旬销货额比三月上中旬平均销货额增加了百分之十八；沈阳市百货公司仅销售香皂一项，四月十二、三两日比降低牌价前两日即多销百分之四四；上海市百货公司第一门市部降低牌价以后和以前比较，香皂每天多销百分之六十，牙膏多销百分之五十，毛巾多销百分之四十等情形来看，就充分说明了人民的购买力已经相对地提高。因之，广大人民的劳动热忱和生产积极性，也更为高涨。
    同时，由于国营贸易公司牌价的降低，自由市场的商品也随之落价，交易更形活跃。由于农产品价格稳定、工业品价格降落，大大地缩小了工农业产品价格的剪刀差额，提高了广大农民的购买力，这就给工业品开辟了更广阔的市场。因此，工业品价格的合理降低，对工商业的发展是有重大意义的。
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】沈阳市各国营贸易公司正在准备大批商品，供应人民。中国花纱布公司沈阳批发站已和全市私营织布厂、染整厂重新签订了大量布匹的加工合同；中国粮食公司沈阳市公司除已和全市公私营油坊和磨米厂签订了油米加工合同外，并通过基层合作社组织全市手工业磨坊加工苞米面。中国百货公司沈阳市公司已向中国百货公司华北区公司和华东区公司提出调拨大量百货的计划，并派专人到北京、天津、上海采购高级商品。百货公司所属两个加工厂正在加工针织品、春夏服装、鞋帽等物品，以满足“五一”节前后全市职工的大量需要。
    为了将商品迅速推销到市民手中，花纱布公司已规定凡需要大量布匹的各机关、团体可直接向公司订货，门市部专门供应市民的需要。百货公司即将开始调查机关、团体的需要。百货公司所属营业单位除直接供应市民需要外，并加强对全市一百多个基层合作社的物资供应，尽量满足合作社的要求。
    由于“三反”和“五反”运动整顿了国营商业的工作人员的作风和初步纠正了私营厂商在加工中的不法行为，若干主要商品的质量已大为提高。如花纱布公司供应的布，基本上可保证不褪色，下水后不缩尺，一二等布内夹杂三等布或等外布的现象已经消灭。粮食公司供应的高粱米不但色泽洁白，米中的壳皮、糠、碎米也接近全部消除。由于以上原因，国营商业在市民中的威信正日益提高，市场销售也逐渐扩大。百货公司三月末每天的总卖钱额比一月前增加了一倍半，估计今年第二季度供应物资总量将超过去年同时期百分之一百七十。花纱布公司三月份供应给市民的棉布比二月份的售布量增加了百分之九十六点八七。粮食公司三月下旬平均每天供应市民的粮食，也比一月前增加百分之四十七点二三。
