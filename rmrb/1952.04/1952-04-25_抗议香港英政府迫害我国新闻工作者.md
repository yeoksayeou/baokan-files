    Protesting the British Hong Kong Government's Persecution of Chinese News Workers
    Following the bloody atrocity of brutally killing Chinese residents on March 1st, the British Hong Kong government has now unreasonably persecuted Chinese news workers in Hong Kong. We must lodge a serious protest with the British Hong Kong government against this reactionary measure.
    The British Hong Kong government's fabricated "charges" for the illegal "trial" of Chinese news workers stem from the fact that on March 5th, Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong truthfully reported the Chinese people's anger and protest against the British imperialists' bloody atrocity of abusing and killing Chinese residents in Hong Kong. Such reporting is a completely reasonable and legitimate patriotic act. The British Hong Kong government's brazen and unreasonable persecution of this patriotic behavior of Chinese news workers in Hong Kong is clearly another manifestation of the British Hong Kong government's continued open hostility towards the Chinese people.
    The British Hong Kong government's attempt to suppress the patriotic actions of the Chinese people in Hong Kong with its reactionary "ordinances" and illegal "trials" will not succeed. Chinese news workers and patriotic people in Hong Kong are by no means isolated; behind them stands the great strength of the entire Chinese people. If the British Hong Kong government disregards the just protests of the Chinese people and does not cease this sinful activity, it will only further arouse the contempt and anger of the Chinese people and all righteous people in the world.
    Now that this illegal "trial" is still ongoing, we must warn the British Hong Kong government: you must immediately stop this illegal "trial"; if you continue to act arbitrarily, then you will inevitably reap the bitter fruit of your actions. The great Chinese people will absolutely not sit idly by while their compatriots are subjected to such brazen and unreasonable persecution.

    抗议香港英政府迫害我国新闻工作者
    香港英国政府继三月一日蛮横捕杀我国居民的血腥暴行之后，竟又无理地对我国在香港的新闻工作者进行迫害。对于香港英国政府这一反动的措施，我们要向香港英国政府提出严重的抗议。
    香港英国政府非法“审讯”我国新闻工作者的莫须有的“罪名”，是我国在香港的各报三月五日据实报道了中国人民对英帝国主义者虐杀香港我国居民的血腥暴行的愤怒和抗议。这种报道是完全合理和合法的爱国行为。而香港英国政府竟敢对香港我国新闻工作者的这种爱国行为，蛮横无理地加以迫害，这显然是香港英国政府继续公开敌视我国人民的又一表现。
    香港英国政府企图凭借其反动“法令”和非法的“审讯”压制香港我国人民的爱国行动，这是办不到的。香港的我国新闻工作者和爱国人民绝不是孤立的，在他们的背后有着我国全体人民的伟大力量的支持。香港英国政府如果不顾我国人民正义的抗议，如不停止这种罪恶活动，那就只会更加激起我国人民和全世界正义人士对它的卑视和愤怒。
    现在，这一非法“审讯”还在继续进行，我们必须向香港英国政府提出警告：你们必须立即停止这种非法“审讯”；如果你们仍一意孤行，那末你们就必然要自食其苦果的。伟大的中国人民，对自己同胞遭受蛮横无理的迫害，是绝对不能坐视的。
